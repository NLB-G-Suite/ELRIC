<Silvermane> Um?

<ValtheJean> 2,14 that whore of a game does not exist
<Sumica> Dont worry it's showing signs of dieing.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sigh...I just wish private servers could get instances/raids working
<Sumica> You know a game is dieing when they start giving players what they have asked about for years.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 pre-cata servers that is
*ValtheJean would have definitely paid for a blizzard-official pre-cata server
<GGgala> ohai Polarfire
<Sumica> There was even a few devs talking about player made content after cata so if that doset scream death of a game.
<Synros> 8ima to think about stuff, cya
<Sumica> Hi and bye?
*Luna will drag Val with her to GW2
<ValtheJean> 2,14 my friends have been trying to do the same
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm just not sure I want to commit to another MMO again
<Luna> 07no monthly fee
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'd much rather post ponies :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, they told me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but mmos still take up so much time
<Sumica> that they do, altho I have cut way back thanks to my little addiction.
<Luna> 07quit wow
<Luna> 07because PONIES!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm honestly glad there are ponies

<GrimGallop> We're on a pirate server :O
<Luna> 07oooh evil
<Luna> 07:o
<GrimGallop> Indeed
<Luna> 07patched till?
<GrimGallop> WotLK, 3.3.5 I think
<Luna> 07Val might like that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but you don't have working instances though
<Sumica> ohhh
<Luna> 07he wanted a server pre - cata
<GrimGallop> Shiny.
<GrimGallop> Why wouldn't instances work? o.o
<Sumica> looked at one of those servers once. notinge but 20ft tall overly curvy elves as far as the eye can see.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because people have to manually re-write scripts for encounters in private servers, which no one has done
<GrimGallop> lol @ Sumica
<GrimGallop> Well, everything seems to work for me so far~
<GrimGallop> Of course I've mostly been hoarding cloth and stuffing my bank with frostweave
<Sumica> hey luna?
<Luna> 07yes?
<ctrlx> hey everyone. will bronystate be doing a live stream of season 2 ep 1?
<Luna> 07yep

*Sumica bricks DashiteAlt
<Luna> 07as long as you mention us :P

<ctrlx> that and i might bounce the stream to others
<DashiteAlt> Hey! You know you were thinking it too Sumica!
<ctrlx> lolk that's not hard
<ValtheJean> we probably shouldn't encourage this
<Sumica> lol true I was but I only make my guildies put up with my puns.
<ValtheJean> whatwith the copyright violation
<Luna> 07nope, but we can't stop him
<Luna> 07it's his choice
<ValtheJean> yeah, but we shouldn't encourage it is all :P
<Luna> 07we don't encourage it
<Luna> 07we told him, we can't stop him
<Sumica> They joke that I am going for an acheavment of making a pun in every zone and instance.
<MeteorVenture> for being so popular way back when (from what i could tell as a kid) the backstreet boys and other such bands are NEVER mentioned EVER anymore.. aside from as an obvious reference by the leetstreet boys
<Sumica> nah the i love the 90's brought them up on VH1 I am sure.

<MeteorVenture> according to my forces
<ctrlx> damnit, DashiteAlt you made me yawn
<ctrlx> so it's 3am right now. i have to work at 8am until 8pm. just stay up and get wired or goto bed for 3.5hr?
<MeteorVenture> depends on the job probably
<MeteorVenture> if it's pretty chill then that little bit of sleep may help you get through it moderately tired
<Sumica> the micro nap can be supprisingly refreshing. I usealy grab a quick 30min nap on my lunchbreak.
<DashiteAlt> You're welcome ctrlx. :)
<ctrlx> well that depends on the day. i'm like a phone operator/secretary guy at a nursing home but i also do bitch office work or IT stuff if needed.
<DashiteAlt> 3.5 hours is long enough that I'd probably take the sleep.
<MeteorVenture> ya probably sleep imo
<DashiteAlt> Anything less than 3 hours and I would skip it.
<ctrlx> well i need a shower first so like 3hr
<ctrlx> i can probably squeeze it. if not then i'll stay up
<MeteorVenture> well go before another minute is up so you don't have to skip it
<ctrlx> let's give it a shot
<ctrlx> gnite/bbl
<MeteorVenture> lol take care!
<DashiteAlt> I have class tomorrow, but thankfully not until 7.
<DashiteAlt> Or today rather.
<MeteorVenture> yes! i just remembered i could also play kid icarus
<MeteorVenture> which i have never played before so this should be good
<MeteorVenture> that eight ball is a genie
<MeteorVenture> a troll genie at that
<MeteorVenture> gosh.. not to bash the classic controls trying to emulate momentum but only succeeding in making it look and feel like horrible button lag.. but gosh.. take this magic axe bash!
<Sumica> Cant compare to Stevan
<MeteorVenture> ok it's not so bad
<Sumica> Oh I so have to watch the new ep today...er tonight.
<MeteorVenture> new ep?
<Sumica> Topgear
<MeteorVenture> alright thanks
<Sumica> eh?
<Rodman> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dIaWgPnhZcI/Tm0z4ZMer4I/AAAAAAAAL9A/uZwn21DdNzk/s1600/Pizza+Hut+Lol.jpg
<Rodman> That Pizza Hut is win
<Rodman> Definitely
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZGINaRUEkU&feature=youtu.be
<ctrlx> Rodman, that restored a little bit of my faith in humanity <3
<Sumica> I would do that if it was't for the fact pizza hut sucks around here compared to the mom and pop places.
<Rodman> I'd do that if I had the option to :S
<MeteorVenture> that pizza hut is awesome.. except that they didn't actually draw it on the box
<Sumica> I think it's an online ordering thing.
<MeteorVenture> they better have 1 day shipping lols
<Sumica> and yeah it's not on the box but a box would be hard to get a good picture on. And expesnsice to throw out if you slip up.
<ctrlx> when i was at quakecon we had the pizzaguy draw penises on the box
<Rodman> What I'm wondering is whether they drew her while or after the pizza was done
<MeteorVenture> ya.. inb4 shoe on head
<MeteorVenture> with pics
<ctrlx> the second time he drew a teddy bear shooting a dragon
<ctrlx> we tipped him well
<MeteorVenture> maybe there's someone with a full-time job taking these ridiculous requests
<Rodman> And ctrix
<Rodman> *ctrlx
<Rodman> That video
<ctrlx> lol
<Rodman> DAT SONG
<Sumica> more want to know if they had to google it first or was there a brony in the house.
<Rodman> Thats a good question
<ctrlx> well if he wasn't a brony before
<ctrlx> he probably is now
<Rodman> Quite true
<Rodman> Probably the whole Pizza Hut became bronies after that incident
<ctrlx> do ponies eat pizza?
<Rodman> Veggie pizza
<ctrlx> yah
<ctrlx> you just usually see pastries and apple-things though
<Rodman> Poor Gummy
<Sumica> Funny you should ask as I am finishing Cross and arrow.
<Rodman> Huh?
<Sumica> A fanfic, they are currently having pizza =p
<ctrlx> OMG IM NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES MY BODY PARTS ARE GOING TO FALL OFF ;-;
<Sumica> 0_o
<Rodman> :O
<ctrlx> ok we're good. i got pants on now
<Sumica> ....um right glad we got that resloved.
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVn_f0AYXdM
<ctrlx> meant to link this one but it's all good
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDynYwhUyoY
<MeteorVenture> oh gosh! i just realized that the ponies could order a pizza and write "stop discord" and pizza hut would probably do it
<Sumica> yeah but what would they charge? it's like 2 bucks per specal request.
<MeteorVenture> well.. 2 bucks then
<Sumica> Sure they would have to charge more for that.
<MeteorVenture> it is a SPECIAL request.. doesn't happen ever 1000 years
<MeteorVenture> every*
<ctrlx> that'd be 2bits
<MeteorVenture> probably
<ctrlx> (they take cash or credit)
<Sumica> bits duh
<MeteorVenture> pizza pony has suddenly become alot more helpful sounding
<MeteorVenture> inb4 pizza pony is a solve all problems pony as long as you can request it in 28 characters or less
<Sumica> Wonder if Luna ever ordered out.
<ctrlx> pizza pony... would they have special saddlebags for hte pizzas?
<ctrlx> i imagine they'd be pegasi too. to be faster
<MeteorVenture> she probably thought it was a joke and banished herself to season 2
<MeteorVenture> or at least from season 1 after the first part
<Sumica> Would need one of those stay hot bags, I gues would want to make sure it's yah know arodynimic and such
<Luna> 07Freeze
<Luna> 07you here?
<Sumica> LOFN!
<Luna> 07lol
<Luna> 07problem?
<MeteorVenture> someone actually drew a pizza pony
<Sumica> Did you order out for pizza on the moon?
<Luna> 07nah just being busy
<Luna> 07:)
<MeteorVenture> my special request would be "arrive in 10 seconds flat"
<ctrlx> challenge accepted
<ctrlx> then sonic rainbooms
<ctrlx> and your pizza comes all messed up
<ctrlx> :<
<MeteorVenture> then i make a new product called pizza ball's
<MeteorVenture> or pizza ball* i guess
<ctrlx> omg
<MeteorVenture> not for reheat
<ctrlx> cheeze+toppings on inside. wrapped in the crust. then have dippin sauce.
<ctrlx> or you could put a bunch in a bowl of sauce and eat them like cereal
<MeteorVenture> nah.. i was thinking the sauce would be in there too
<MeteorVenture> hot pockets all over again
<ctrlx> ah
<ctrlx> so it'd be more like hot balls
<MeteorVenture> well.. tostino pizza rolls anyway
<Luna> 07yes I did
<ctrlx> do ho ho ho
<Luna> 07http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dIaWgPnhZcI/Tm0z4ZMer4I/AAAAAAAAL9A/uZwn21DdNzk/s1600/Pizza+Hut+Lol.jpg
<MeteorVenture> those are amazing
<MeteorVenture> btw this kid icarus game is ridiculous.. i'm not sure whether i'm suppose to be dying quite as bad as i am or not but this aint right
<Awesomeshy> wb
<Awesomeshy> it seems like
<Awesomeshy> you're having problems
<Sumica> Back in HS when I worked in a pizza place I used to make somthing like a pizza ball when bored.
<Donraj__> Yes
<Donraj> Laptop keeps freezing up
<Sumica> take some dough wrap it around a bit of topping seal it up good then deepfry it.
<Donraj> Four times in the past fifteen minutes
<Donraj> Need to figure out who I need to call about it tomorrow
<Awesomeshy> this is why I try to keep my irc client in a different place than my desktop
<ctrlx> Donraj, what is it?
<Donraj> I don't know
<Donraj> Something's clearly wrong with it
<ctrlx> Donraj, nah, like what model and os :P
<Donraj> It's always frozen up occasionally, but lately it's been lasting for like a minute each time
<Donraj> Oh
<Donraj> Asus, Windows 7
<ctrlx> eeepc?
<Donraj> I'm not much of a technical person, I don't know what that means
<Awesomeshy> is it a netbook
<Awesomeshy> or a laptop
<ctrlx> is it super small cute netbook?
<Donraj> Laptop
<Donraj> Fairly large one
<ctrlx> might be hte same one my friend has
<Awesomeshy> then it's not an Eee PC
<ctrlx> his runs fine though
<ctrlx> does it have an ssd?
<ctrlx> and does it get hot?
<Donraj> Don't think so
<Donraj> No
<Donraj> It runs pretty cool
<MeteorVenture> then throw it in the garbage cause that's bad for you
<ctrlx> you could try booting into memtest and see if your ram is fine
<MeteorVenture> amirite guys?
<ctrlx> other than that just make sure windows is clean of shit
<ctrlx> else there's a hardware failure somewhere that's causing the system to hang
<Rodman> Meteor, you heretic
<MeteorVenture> that's me.. invincible until i get in a banshee
<MeteorVenture> halo 2 reference for you ancient people
<ctrlx> halo 1 or bust
<MeteorVenture> cause halo is.. a little old
<ctrlx> which i'm excited for hte remake, as long as they just do graphics
<ctrlx> keep hte pistol the same :3
<ctrlx> otherwise i'm excited for tribes
<ctrlx> and skyrim
<MeteorVenture> ya halo 1 is best halo quite probably
<MeteorVenture> i quit after 2 though
<MeteorVenture> didn't care for a 360
<ctrlx> im a pc person
<MeteorVenture> the pistol better kill in 3 shots and be an all purpose weapon in other words
<ctrlx> sniping with a pistol....fuckya
<MeteorVenture> all the time
<Awesomeshy> I didn't even notice you weren't in here
<MeteorVenture> also don't forget to whip your shotgun aimer and shoot when it gets to them cause it's infinitely more accurate than if you don't move your aimer before shooting
<MeteorVenture> also gotta love 1 shot shotgun kills from halfway across hang em high
<MeteorVenture> S
<MeteorVenture> SOMEHOW*
<ctrlx> because it's just that cool
<MeteorVenture> and of course i don't mean halfway.. but it was a distance.. and it happened.. i don't know how.. but that shotgun was way better than halo 2's shotgun
<Kabaka> I disconnected _hours_ ago
<Awesomeshy> lol
<Awesomeshy> also
<Awesomeshy> did you add in the stuff for mibbit yet?
<Kabaka> Switched that ZNC account to a, uh, secret new place
<MeteorVenture> and they proved you could nerf the best weapon into being useless even with 2 of them in the sequel (pistol)
<Kabaka> Yeah, hours ago
<Kabaka> I totally forgot to get the password for anyone
<MeteorVenture> only good for headshots
<Awesomeshy> gimmie info for it
<Kabaka> Sure
<ctrlx> headshots aren't hard in halo though
<Kabaka> Oh I still need to copy it everywhere. It's actually only one place. No wonder
<Awesomeshy> I just need the password actually
<Kabaka> That won't take more than a second though
<Awesomeshy> oh lol
<Kabaka> Yeah
<ctrlx> at least doing it the proper fps way (mouse and keyboard)
<MeteorVenture> oh ya.. i meant in halo 2 for pistols
<Awesomeshy> I can get all the other info on my own
<Kabaka> Noticed to you
<ctrlx> onyl time i use a controller is for racing games....and.......that;s about it, really
<Awesomeshy> oh hey we were talking about this in here
<MeteorVenture> i'm pretty much probably a PC guy now too.. consoles kinda just suck now.. no good games for them anyway
<Awesomeshy> I thought we were in the other room
<Awesomeshy> lol
<MeteorVenture> and no modding or any of that fun jazz
<Kabaka> Yeah :-\
<ctrlx> and pc has better graphics
<ctrlx> easier to pirate
<Rodman> Just look at Fallout 3 and NV
<Rodman> Moddable as all fuck
<Awesomeshy> should we also add irc.ponyirc.com?
<Awesomeshy> no
<MeteorVenture> i don't pirate games still on the market.. if they're there i will just buy them cause the people have every right to charge for their product
<Rodman> Exactly
<MeteorVenture> i would hope people would do the same for me when i make games
<Kabaka> >no
<Kabaka> Correct
<Rodman> Now, if the game in question is no longer being sold and you can't find copies on ebay or such
<Rodman> Thats when I would say to go for it
<Rodman> Otherwise, buy it for crying out loud!
<MeteorVenture> or if you already own it
<Awesomeshy> I learned my lesson from last time
<Rodman> Then why would you pirate it?
<Awesomeshy> have all this information ready before I make a fool of myself
<MeteorVenture> well if you want it on PC
<Awesomeshy> god I was bumbling around in there
<Awesomeshy> I swear he was either annoyed or laughing at me
<ctrlx> i've lost discs or they've gotten damaged and i've had to pirate them
<MeteorVenture> moddable.. easy to make videos of
<Luna> 07Alright goodbye everyone
<Luna> 07See you later today
<ctrlx> Luna, the sun's not up yet!
<MeteorVenture> take care luna!
*GrimGallop reappears
<Kabaka> Who?
<Kabaka> Mibbit doods?
<GrimGallop> Awwww
<GrimGallop> Just as I get back...
<ctrlx> anyways, now that i have money i will buy games. and have bought games that i've pirated and played through before
<Sumica> She heard you comeing
<ctrlx> but some games are trash and i don't buy those P:
<GrimGallop> Well, take this before you go!
<GrimGallop> Awwww
<GrimGallop> I was going to give her a potato D:
<Awesomeshy> ye
<Sumica> I buy games but detest DLC's
<GrimGallop> Anyways, sleep for me~
<MeteorVenture> well did you finish said trashy games? lol
<Awesomeshy> what version of charybdis are we using?
<MeteorVenture> anyway stuff like DRM or whatever it was.. is a good incentive to pirate after buying it sometimes
<MeteorVenture> such as in the case of assassins creed 2
<Kabaka> Current stable
<Kabaka> 3.3.0
<MeteorVenture> from what i heard anyway
<ctrlx> nah. we were all playing dead island the other night thoguh
<ctrlx> and it was fun and stuff. but only because we were getting hte trucks where they shouldn't be
<ctrlx> other then that the game's boring
<ctrlx> i might uninstall it
<Octavia> 13Damn, The Sunscreen Song always makes me teary eyed
<ctrlx> but at quakecon i bought the qc2011 pack and it's got every game made by id and bethesda in hte last 20 years
<ctrlx> and i've pirated quite a number of them already
<MeteorVenture> well i think if you don't plan on buying it.. just quit playing it right then when you realize it's bad.. i find problems with most every game i play but that doesn't mean i didn't have a good time playing some of them
<ctrlx> yah. and then you also got abandonware too.
<MeteorVenture> what's abandonware?
<Sumica> The what Octavia
<ctrlx> just ooooold games that the company either doesn't exist or doesn't care about
<Octavia> 13lol Its a song. It always really touches me.
<MeteorVenture> alright
<ctrlx> Octavia, that one with the voiceover guy?
<Octavia> 13Its by Baz Luhrmann

<Octavia> 13Unless its a real nice one. Then you have to hand wash it.
<ctrlx> on her tag though it says no machine
<ctrlx> idk how to handwash
<ctrlx> do i just toss her in hte shower?
<Octavia> 13Many do. I machine wash them anyway. XD
<Octavia> 13lol
<Octavia> 13In the tub or in a sink.
<Octavia> 13Not sure what type of soap to use though.
<ctrlx> i'll just try plain water first
<Sumica> dont dunk it. use like a soft toothbrush and litly scrub it.
<ctrlx> brushie :3
<Sumica> indeed
<ctrlx> i wish i could make her neck more stiff
<ctrlx> her head likes to flop
<Sumica> a small amout of normal clothing soap in a large amount of water.
<MeteorVenture> if you give her a bath watch out for gummy
<Sumica> so this came up in the related videos to yours Octavia
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l1GvDWtccI

<Sumica> feh.
<ctrlx> pinkie's hair isn't the best but it's bearable
<Sumica> I might request this one night when we are taking them.
<ctrlx> it's cute how their little legs flail around
<Octavia> 13As for plushies, I'm waiting til MagnaStorm on DA accepts commissions again. $80 or so for a nice pony plush... so worth it.
<Sumica> that I can see
<ctrlx> i want some nice decals for my computer(s)
<ctrlx> and i was thinking maybe one those patch things
<MeteorVenture> haha i like that sunscreen thing
<ctrlx> for one of my hoodies
<Sumica> pony hoodie?
<ctrlx> nah just regular hoodies....with pony patch things
<Sumica> heh

<ctrlx> i have like 14 hoodies
<ctrlx> there's a couple more hiding somewhere
<ctrlx> so i can use a couple for pony patches
<Sumica> So yeah just googled for said patches and oh look there is a G1 named patch.
<Octavia> 13Grrr, why must Renaissance outfits cost so much! >.<
<Octavia> 13Curse being poor!
<ctrlx> Sumica, http://ethepony.ecrater.com/p/12058506/dj-pon3-patch
<Octavia> 13There is a serious lack of Octavia patch there.
<Octavia> 13Nightly Roundup time!

<Sumica> iron on not software you crazyperson.
<ctrlx> oh ho ho ho

<Turgle> dun dun duuuuun
<MeteorVenture> 45 or so seconds in and i realized that i was totally not listening to what they people were saying.. just the ponies
<Sumica> Good sum up of it all but man that audio.
<Rodman> Dat Night was fucking metal
<Sumica> magneto the first person to troll ponies and not fail.
<Rodman> Indeed
<Rodman> And he did it by being an ad
<Sumica> Sounds like some one clicke it and killed the whole stream at one point.
<Sumica> and with that I go to bed.
<Turgle> goodnight!
<MeteorVenture> well for some reason that woke me up a bit
<MeteorVenture> despite everyone obviously being sleep deprived
<MeteorVenture> i've run out of things that i want to do.. i guess it's time to go to sleep
<MeteorVenture> or is it?... goodnight yall!
<MeteorVenture> hasta la windows vista
<Scotaloo> Is it 9am CST this is showing? Or have I got that wrong?
<EspyLacopa> heh, On a Cross and Arrow has updated.
<EspyLacopa> Applebuck gets the help of the Great and Powerful Presto.
<Rodman> Wuh?!
<Rodman> Presto eh...
<Rodman> I dunno, I expected some other name
<NewDCD> ohai ponies
<Rodman> Ohai NewDCD
<Rodman> How's it going?
<NewDCD> just here
<NewDCD> waiting for class
<NewDCD> wishing I was sleeping instead
<NewDCD> ergo, nothing new
<Turgle> hey there
<Turgle> D:
<Turgle> im late
<Rodman> Waiting for 10PM to hit here so an awesome barbecue can start
<Rodman> Hai Turgle
<NewDCD> today we might go visit kids with VIH though and play with them. Might. I'm hoping we do!
<Turgle> i have to be at work in 20 minutes D:
<Turgle> bye! xD
<Rodman> Oh man, thats nice!
<Rodman> You give em kids a fun time DCD!
<Rodman> *IF* you end up going...
<NewDCD> yeah
<NewDCD> frankly it had been fixed for, but it's an "assignment" for Sociology, who traded with Biostatistics (Biostatistics has four professors)
<NewDCD> traded the time slot, I mean, buuuuut
<NewDCD> Friday's professor ended up not going so someone else had to fill for them
<NewDCD> Then today Friday's professor would have to give class
<NewDCD> So they'd have to ask him if he'd agree to trade hours...and we don't know if they would yet
<NewDCD> so yeah
<NewDCD> (Frankly if they don't, that'd be a dick move among dick moves)
<Rodman> For serious
<Rodman> "Naw-aw! You're not going to go play with sick kids and thats final!"
<NewDCD> (Because kids)
<Rodman> Ninja'd
<NewDCD> also
<NewDCD> http://m.fanfiction.net/s/4961847/1/
<RobotPinkie> What up, neighas?
<NewDCD> I'm thinking about doing a live dramatic reading of that story
<RobotPinkie> Sounds... enticing
<NewDCD> disregard it's Evangelion
<NewDCD> It's just TOO GOOD (and almost stand-alone)
<Rodman> "In Need of Sex"
<NewDCD> dear God read that shit
<NewDCD> I was in stitches
<Rodman> Well, that's a nice title
<Rodman> I don't mind Evangelio at all
<Rodman> *n
<NewDCD> The door opened. A man came into her home and into her heart.
<Rodman> BTW, is something wrong with the stream here?
<NewDCD> What the man said next could best be described as nothing short of poetry. "Pizza's here. Hot and fresh and covered with enough juicy sausage to delight any woman's mouth."
<Rodman> Got to use that catchphrase at some point
<NewDCD> Hikari's heart throbbed and she blushed when she first looked at this stranger. He was tall and certainly the most handsome man she had ever met. He wore a red uniform shirt that could not contain the well-defined muscles of his arms and abs, and he wore very short shorts that showed off the impressive muscles in his legs. Oh, sigh, and his face—it was beautiful.
<NewDCD> Perfect brown hair, the best ears she had ever seen, an authoritative nose, a powerful jaw and the eyes, oh, the hazel eyes, pierced into Hikari Hirako's soul. He was so hot it was making her hot inside.
<Rodman> Dr. McDreamy has entered the room!
<Rodman> Somebody fetch me the shotgun!
<NewDCD> seriously I read through that story imagining Touji as ManSpike
<Rodman> NOT SURE IF WANT..............
<Rodman> FUCK IT, WANT
<NewDCD> it was hilarous
<NewDCD> also Rodman: we're switching our stream provider to a better service
<NewDCD> Then, he spoke. Hikari knew what he would say, but she let him ask what he wanted to ask. "Hikari," he ravished her name while demanding her body with his eyes, "will you wash my shirt for me?"
<NewDCD> Her heart melted for him so quickly it created a hearty, wet waterfall of emotion that rushed down her body
<Rodman> Ok, I see
<NewDCD> "Yes," she accepted his wish. They looked deeper into each other's eyes. "Dear lord, yes!" Sparks flew from their eyes in an inferno of fiery passion. "Take me to my washing machine and I will clean your shirt better than any shirt has been washed before. I will not use bleach, since it would taint your shirt and my feelings for you. I will use burning hot water because my heart burns for you. And if your shirt shrinks," she added with a
<NewDCD> "Oh, Hikari," he embraced her tightly. "I have never felt this way for a woman before. You are so beautiful," he cupped her cheek, and noticed she shied away from the compliment. "You are. You are beautiful." Slowly, she looked at him and he nodded. Yes, she held a powerful beauty over him. In his eyes, she was hot. "And you will look even more beautiful as you do my laundry."
<NewDCD> THAT'S WHEN I FUCKING LOST IT
<Rodman> I just fucking lost it here
<Rodman> "And you will look even more beautiful as you do my laundry."
<Rodman> Best. Catchphrase. EVER!
<NewDCD> this fic is the best thing.
<Rodman> DAT LIVE READING!
<Rodman> DO EET!
<NewDCD> His face became ever so slightly pink—it was a man blush. "Yeah," he scratched the back of his head, "I would love to suck back on some water, or any of the juices you have, Hikari."
<Rodman> MAN BLUSH
<Rodman> Like MAN TEARS
<NewDCD> "I have apple, orange, and grape juice."
<NewDCD> "I like orange. It's sticky," Touji whispered. Keep in mind, his shirt was being washed and Hikari was defenceless against his manly charms. She squirmed and her breasts jiggled when he looked at her. "But I'll have water," he added, "since it's the wettest drink of all—the best to quench my thirst."
*RobotPinkie sees what's going on and slowly backs away
<NewDCD> Pinkie
<NewDCD> I found the greatest fic in existence
<NewDCD> not sure if I should adapt it to poni, but I WILL live read it sometime
<Rodman> RobotPinkie, come closer
<Rodman> This fic is great
<RobotPinkie> Well, if you adapt it to pony....
<RobotPinkie> and I DO love laundry
<NewDCD> It could be
<NewDCD> Humanized Beefspike and Applebloom
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RobotPinkie> I finally found Cheerilee today!
<Rodman> Applebloom? Please! Make it Rarity!
<Rodman> Although, that would be too predictable
<Rodman> Actually, leave it at Applebloom.
<NewDCD> but Rarity has no freckles
<RobotPinkie> I think I need to give her an 80's makeover...
<NewDCD> inb4 AJ
<RobotPinkie> induring AJ; But what about AJ?
<RobotPinkie> inafter AJ
<NewDCD> oh God
<NewDCD> Cheerilee and Caramel
<NewDCD> @Flippinghisshitmeter ValtheJean
<NewDCD> NO
<NewDCD> WAIT
<NewDCD> LET'S MAKE IT FLUTTERSHY
<Rodman> OH GOOD FUCKING CELESTIA, WHAT?!?!
<Rodman> Or, you know, make it God
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO9TGlqXhGs
<NewDCD> Technically Twilight fits the most
<NewDCD> but I was just cracking up at the thought of Fluttsie doing Laundry
<NewDCD> (That and she probably has the lowest self-esteem out of all of the ponies(
<Rodman> Thats true
<Rodman> But then you'd have to make Angel disappear for a while
<NewDCD> also Fluttershy is the easiest name to scramble
<NewDCD> And tell me Fluttsie writing "smut" don't crack you up
<Rodman> :V
<RobotPinkie> Fluttershy sometimes looks like she's ready to make Angel "disappear" for good
<Rodman> :V :V
<Rodman> Ok, thats a good point
<NewDCD> SHUTTERFLY
<NewDCD> STUDYING QUANTUM PHYSICS
<Rodman> Shutterfly?
<Rodman> Why not Shulterfry?
<Rodman> *scramblinglikeaboss*
<Rodman> Shuetelfry
<Rodman> *shurtelfry
<NewDCD> because my tongue would trip on itself every time I try to say that
<Rodman> Another good point
<NewDCD> that
<NewDCD> and because the actual story does scramble the names very lightly for humorous effect:
<NewDCD> Horaki Hikari > Hirako Hikari
<NewDCD> now what to do with Spike's name
<NewDCD> NO WAIT
<NewDCD> IT SHOULD BE
<NewDCD> BIG MAC INSTEAD
<RobotPinkie> QP is much tastier, IMO
<NewDCD> quick, I need a corruption of Big Macintosh's name
<NewDCD> QP?
<EspyLacopa> Does it have to be apple-themed?
<RobotPinkie> quarter pounder, another hamburger. :P
<NewDCD> oh. I mean the stallion
<Rodman> Whopper Jr?
<RobotPinkie> Kinda hard to corrupt that name while still keeping it recognizable... hmmm
<RobotPinkie> Well, best hamburger is The Angus, but I'm not sure if that's available everywhere...
<Rodman> Call him Angus then
<NewDCD> guys guys
<RobotPinkie> lol Big Angus
<Rodman> But if you need an easily recognizable name, call him Big Whopper
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I know, the stallion :P
<RobotPinkie> lol actually that'd work pretty well
<RobotPinkie> it's like a double reference, too
<RobotPinkie> Also I'm srsly tempted to mod my Lily Blossom into Derpy
<Rodman> In what?
<NewDCD> I ws thinking of Big Markintosh
<NewDCD> But Big Whopper made me LOL. We'll go with that
<RobotPinkie> The brushable Lily Blossom, I mean
<Rodman> *DEEPBREATH* yay~!
<Rodman> Oh, ok RP
<RobotPinkie> She's a grey pegasus with blonde hair, just like Derpy
<Rodman> DO EET FILLY!
<RobotPinkie> I'll have to skip the derp eyes, though, not good at painting. :(
<Rodman> :(
<Aristeo> rawr
<RobotPinkie> maybe I can find some Swedish brony to do that for me, we'll see
<Jason> :O
<Jason> hi
<NewDCD> also class time
<NewDCD> bbl
<RobotPinkie> alright, later NewDCD
<RobotPinkie> ohlol, too late
<Rodman> Bye DCD
<Rodman> Make those kids happy
<NewDCD> nevermind
<NewDCD> professor just called me
<NewDCD> she'll be 20 minutes late cause her car broke down
<RobotPinkie> oh okay
<Rodman> Oh my
<NewDCD> also guys
<NewDCD> let's discuss crack pairings
<NewDCD> Blueblood X Fluttershy
<NewDCD> go
<Rodman> Lets see, in such a relationship, Fluttershy would be a victim
<Rodman> Blueblood would be demanding and inconsiderate, whilst Fluttershy's own nature wouldn't allow her to get rid of him like Rarity did
<Rodman> In there, I'd say Fluttershy's strongest asset would be Angel, who would constantly have to keep her in check so she doesn't let herself get treated like trash by Blueblood
<Rodman> That is one badass bunny
<NewDCD> you guys are forgetting something
<NewDCD> >Youregoingtoloveme.gif
<NewDCD> and then Blueblood was hilarously whipped
<NewDCD> okay
<NewDCD> Cheerilee X Caramel
<NewDCD> Not so much crack as it is unfounded
<NewDCD> inb4 /ss/
<Rodman> Cherilee X caramel....
<Rodman> Oh boy
<Rodman> Give me a moment to think
<Rodman> I'll only be going with Canon, not Fanon here
<Rodman> So lets see
<Rodman> Cherilee is seen as a kind one, the type that will push you and motivate you to do something
<Rodman> Caramel seems like a clumsy guy, and that's the best description I can make of him given his short screentime
<Jason> hey GGgala_
<Rodman> So, what I imagine is, if they got together, Cherilee would serve as an anchor for him as he tries to become ever more useful whilst constantly failing
<Rodman> I dunno really
<Rodman> RP, any thoughts?
<NewDCD> that reminds me
<NewDCD> Caramel X Twilight was popular for a short while for some reason
<Rodman> .............
<Rodman> Why?
<NewDCD> no idea
<NewDCD> I THINK someone wrote a fic, many people found it diabeetus-tastic, and drew fanart of said couple
<Rodman> O_o???
<Rodman> Leave it to the Fandom
<Rodman> At this point, I wouldn't be surprised by a Derpy X Heavy if somebody ponified all the TF2 cast
<NewDCD> class starting
<NewDCD> Bbl
<Rodman> Cya
<AllisZero> Good morning everypony
<Rodman> NewDCD leave and in comes AllisZero

<RobotPinkie> I haven't read it, except what DCD posted here
<RobotPinkie> is it that bad?
<AllisZero> Well no, but now my firewall knows someone's gone to the adult section of fanfiction.net :P
<RobotPinkie> Ouch

<Rodman> That is kind of out of nowhere
<herosprit> Let's add more to it.
<herosprit> Trixmac Sparkleshy
<herosprit> :0
<FreezeFrame> Rodman: Read Romancing Quest
<Purple`Prose> Trixity MacSparkleshy
<Rodman> To get all the CaramelXTwilight shipping?
<Rodman> Ok
<FreezeFrame> Nope
<herosprit> Oooh, very nice Purple
<FreezeFrame> Also, I like what Blueblood's entry on the shipping chart is.
<Purple`Prose> ^_^
<herosprit> TrixityDash MacSparkleshy
<Purple`Prose> :O
<herosprit> We'll eventually fit every non-background pony into one ship.
<Purple`Prose> Trixityvia Macsparkleshy
<Purple`Prose> Trixityvia Macsparkleshy the Dash-3
<FreezeFrame> Though the incest entries always worry me.
<Purple`Prose> >:D
<Rodman> Its the internet
<Rodman> Incest is Wincest to most
<herosprit> We can exclude Big Mac and Applejack from eachother :0
<Purple`Prose> Alright
<Purple`Prose> Doctorjack Trixityvia MacSparkleshy the Dash-3
<Purple`Prose> *smug*
<herosprit> TrixityviaGildapple Macsparkleshy the Dash-3
<Rodman> That'd be one crazy love............. *counts sides like a boss*
<FreezeFrame> There's two on that shipping chart. There's also Princest

<herosprit> Oh my Prose. Now you're really stretching it to background Ponies.
<herosprit> That is quite the undertaking.
<Purple`Prose> Kamen Rider Fourze: if the Fonz was Japanese and got ahold of a space-shuttle themed battlesuit.
<herosprit> I've been playing Blazblue again.
<herosprit> FU! RIN! KA ZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<NewDCD> ...And attended Cromartie High, by written by the author of Gurren Lagann
<NewDCD> BANG BANG BANG BANG
<Purple`Prose> With the cast of Glee
<NewDCD> BANGUU DAMASHII
<herosprit> THANK YOU DCD :D
<NewDCD> Bang is one of the best Rider expies
<NewDCD> like May Lee
<herosprit> necessary http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYKPmkOF-z8&feature=related
<NewDCD> she kicks ass too
<FreezeFrame> This is more necessary: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuAl-Y7aRRQ
<herosprit> Lol, poor Bang
<NewDCD> also guys
<NewDCD> How do you interpret the age gap between Mrs Cake/Mayor Mare and Granny Smith?
<NewDCD> I'm thinking on having a plot point in a fic in which Granny Smith was the Cool Big Sis to those two when they were fillies
<herosprit> Make Granny Smith the biggest badass possible. :I
<FreezeFrame> Making up for it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzgf32erYaA&feature=related
<NewDCD> herosprit: already on that
<NewDCD> however I want to know just how older would GS be
<herosprit> These vidoes make me sad that I have the PSP version. Dem graphics
<NewDCD> would Cake and Mare be CMC-age when Smith was Mane Cast age? Ect.
<herosprit> That sounds about right, actually.
<NewDCD> hero I KNOW THAT FEEL
<herosprit> :0
<herosprit> Which feel
<NewDCD> owning BB PSP and none of the home console ones

<NewDCD> we've been working like crazy for the S2 stream
<Luna> 07yes, that and the tons of other stuff in the background
<herosprit> I haven't.
<NewDCD> it's only natural that our natural defenses would be low as a result
<herosprit> I'm borderline useless :0
<NewDCD> I caught a cold last week, but I'm better now
<herosprit> Borderline. I can make, like, sandwiches and stuff.

<Luna> 07the new domain
<RobotPinkie> Well, that's cool
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah... and the new streaming service used
<Luna> 07yep and the nice watermark
<AllisZero> That's never good.
<AllisZero> It's awesome how dedicated you guys are
<AllisZero> Is it bronystate.com now?
<Luna> 07bronystate.net
<AllisZero> or .net
<AllisZero> There we go
<Luna> 07and we are still recruiting
<Luna> 07hint hint!
<RobotPinkie> Well, what do you need?
<RobotPinkie> lol I'm kinda swamped as it is with studies and work
<Luna> 07Mods
<DecapKing> what?
<Luna> 07Creative people
<Luna> 07name your talent and i'll see if we can work something out
<DecapKing> whats going on?
<RobotPinkie> CSS and XHTML is a talent that might apply...
<DecapKing> im good with UDK
<RobotPinkie> I can do some basic logo work, image manipulation and such.
<Luna> 07nothing special is going on.. just a unusual lack of sleep.. so much to do to make the S2 premiere the best experience for you guys ever
<prince-dari> Hey Wrek?
<RobotPinkie> Well, I still wish you didn't have to forego sleep for us :(
<Luna> 07Dari
<Luna> 07he's drawing
<Luna> 07on his live-stream
<prince-dari> Ah.
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna
<prince-dari> What's the link again?
<DecapKing> I can do basic scripting and make maps and certain scenarios to go with them, I can also make some stuff in Flash
<Luna> 07http://www.livestream.com/johntb
<Wrek> 05hi dari
<AllisZero> I'd love to, but with my raiding schedule on weekends it's hard to be here for BMN :(
<AllisZero> Creative people huh. I may be able to chip in with some artwork
<AllisZero> Brb, need to help them ponyfolk
<Luna> 07he just tuned in into your channel :P
<prince-dari> Just wondering if you could make something Flash compatable.
<Wrek> 05itriguing
<prince-dari> I could do it myself but I have no doubt it'd look a lot better if you did it.
<DecapKing> but my talents seem to be somewhat useless in this situation....
<DecapKing> oh, I can also use Unity
<WhatPayne> Oh, I am the God of hellfire!
*WhatPayne installed new RAM
<Wrek> 05hmm
*DecapKing installed the newest beta of UDK
<WhatPayne> Unreal?
<DecapKing> eeeyup
<WhatPayne> Ooh... Whatcha working on?
<DecapKing> well, im in the middle of downloading it
<DecapKing> just some random stuff
<DecapKing> work on scripting
<prince-dari> I've done a sort of placeholder for now though.
<WhatPayne> Alright

<Hat> i like the watermark
<Luna> 07yay!
<Hat> what font is it in?
<DecapPony> I see no watermark

<DecapPony> are you streaming just a black screen?
<Hat> can i make a suggestion for the watermark
<Luna> 07go ahead
<Hat> it might be good if it had two colours, via a border or a slight gradient so it doesn't go invisible when there's something pink onscreen
<DecapPony> wait, is the watermark like pink/purple?
<Hat> its on the low-quality stream
<DecapPony> i feel like Gordon Freeman because im running around killing stuff with a crowbar >.>
<EspyLacopa> Beware the mighty crowbar.
<Hat> :O
<herosprit> I really hope you're playing a game right now Decap.
<DecapPony> i am
<DecapPony> Dead Island
<DecapPony> mfw i find a relvoler that i cant use for another like 8 levels
<herosprit> Lol.
<DecapPony> but it doesnt matter, i have a cleaver to throw
<EspyLacopa> But if you throw your cleaver, you won't have it anymore.
<DecapPony> you go and pick it back up
<Luna> 07i'll pass the suggestion through
<Luna> 07thanks Hat
<Hat> yw
<DecapPony> is there a way to make it so that when you run a program that you always run it as administrator?
<Hat> http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/always-start-an-application-in-administrator-mode-on-windows-vista/
<DecapPony> what about on windows 7?
<Hat> its the same
<DecapPony> thanks
<Hat> np
<prince-dari> Hey.
<prince-dari> How big should the traffic lights be?
<prince-dari> As in pixel size?
<Barry> Hi
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi
<AllisZero> Right click the .exe, to go the compatibility tab, then check always run as administrator
<AllisZero> me 10 minutes late but has that crap in memory.
<DecapPony> already did
<herosprit> So I was just on EQD.
<herosprit> Did you guys see that Hasbro put a Magneto toy in the MLP store? XD
<Rainbow_Dash> Yes
<Rainbow_Dash> Herosprit, you failed your name again
<herosprit> ffffffffffffff
<Silverscreen> FFFFFFFFFFF
<AllisZero> I lold at that herospirit
<AllisZero> But looks like it's fake
<herospirit> Yah, I hear that as well
<AllisZero> Aaaaanyway, I'm gonna go get lunch and check out my car loan
<AllisZero> See you guys in an hour or so
<Silverscreen> What looks quite fake?
<herospirit> http://www.hasbro.com/mylittlepony/en_US/shop/details.cfm?guid=F4DC0C22-6F95-1014-AC4F-9CBB844E488B&product_id=23883
<Rainbow_Dash> Your mustache
<RobotPinkie> I do love my moustache, even if it's not of Spike-ian proportions.
<Rainbow_Dash> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/225/a/4/yeeeeeeehaaaaaaaa_by_kurokaji11-d46gmt2.png
<Charles> hey guys
<Wrek> 05will they be between the banners?
<EspyLacopa> Ah, Hero saw the MAGNETO!
<RobotPinkie> [insert joke about prince-dari being her biggest fan]
<prince-dari> Owo
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Rainbow_Dash> Dont open the door http://jaquelinamyrose.deviantart.com/art/Trick-and-Treat-257761535
<DecapPony> why not?
<Rainbow_Dash> Look at the eyes. Pure hatred.. EVIL
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie is the goddess of parties. She's not evil.
<Rainbow_Dash> Thats true.. But the eyes in that picture
<Rainbow_Dash> Wouldnt you be at least a little teensy bit afraid?
<DecapPony> i see nothing wrong with that picture at all
<DecapPony> nope
<Rainbow_Dash> (I'm exaggerating)
<RobotPinkie> I might be afraid of whoever it is on the left...
<Rainbow_Dash> Thats Bubble Berry, the male version of Pinkie Pie
<Rainbow_Dash> (On a Cross and an Arrow)
<RobotPinkie> ah okay, well that explains it
<RobotPinkie> Can't keep track of all the OCs :(
<Rainbow_Dash> Not sure if you would consider them an OC
<Rainbow_Dash> They are in reality, just a genderswap
<Rainbow_Dash> So Rule 63
<Rainbow_Dash> http://trotsworth.deviantart.com/gallery/29830774
<Flutteryay> Yay.
<prince-dari> DCD
<prince-dari> <_<
<prince-dari> Ohai
<RobotPinkie> ohay NewDCD
<NewDCD> what happen
<prince-dari> Your phone got flash DCD?
<NewDCD> I didn't get my super admin powers
<NewDCD> oh there we go
<NewDCD> dari: NOPE.tiff
<prince-dari> Meh.
<NewDCD> why?
<prince-dari> Traffic lights.
<prince-dari> I finished them.
<prince-dari> I love stuff like this, it's cool. XD
<NewDCD> Fuckwintastic
<prince-dari> >change number in XML file
<prince-dari> >traffic light changes live
<NewDCD> so tell me Dario-sama-san-chan-kun-tachi
<prince-dari> Awesomez.
<NewDCD> will Oddyseus allow us to implement a Dynamic Limit System?
<prince-dari> You mean to throttle the number of messages people can send or what?
<NewDCD> (We should call that DLS, cause that sounds awesome)
<NewDCD> no I mean for the main rooms
<NewDCD> although yes, a throttled room should be part of our agenda
<prince-dari> To stop people from joining locked rooms I'd just make them invite only.
<prince-dari> Bot would handle it all automatically.
<NewDCD> winning
<anonypony> ffffffffff
<NewDCD> when will the new system be implemented?
<prince-dari> I can't really implement it before we have the frontend set up.
<NewDCD> you mean the thing Wrek and Silver are working on?
<prince-dari> They only thing I'm still thinking about how to do is message throttling still.
<prince-dari> I'm not sure who's working on it.
<prince-dari> All I can think of is that the chat is moderated.
<prince-dari> People get auto-voice on join.
<prince-dari> And when they send a message their voice is removed for a couple minutes or something.
<prince-dari> By a bot.
<NewDCD> how about I google message throttling
<NewDCD> Although that does sound like something that'd work
<NewDCD> As long as we can turn off voice notifications
<prince-dari> You can change the settings on the mibbit embed so that it doesn't show when people get/lose voice right?
<prince-dari> Though anyone not using mibbit would still see the messages.
<NewDCD> Maybe I could, I'll try
<NewDCD> Try to see if there's someway to disable that notification though
<EspyLacopa> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/243/e/7/profile_solaris_by_trotsworth-d48fbmb.png <-- Nifty
<Rainbow_Dash> I just saw that a few minutes ago
<Daz> "an age of love and tolearnce...and all will know... that 300 ponies... gave their LAST BREATH to defend it!"
<RobotPinkie> ohay Daz
<EmmettBrown> Anyone seen the Professor Layton movie?
<EmmettBrown> If I win the choice of movie next week,I'll either choose that or back to the future,still undecided.
<Hat> http://bash.org/?244321
<Daz> ohey RobotPinkie
<Daz> Hat - I like that Cthon98 person
<Hat> :p
<RobotPinkie> Wow, I didn't know IRC could do that! Let me try: ********
<Daz> Hmm, let me try too: ****:3*****
<Daz> :3
<Hat> obviously everyone's password here would be rainbow20
<Rainbow_Dash> Dat title
<Daz> ...mfw Sonic Generations will feature Shadow. Why, sega?
<RobotPinkie> Should be what, Hat? That just shows up as rainbow20 to me.
<Daz> o u silly
<Hat> you all see *****s though :D
<RobotPinkie> Shadow as a playable character in the "new school" levels, or in both, Daz?
<Daz> I'm bored of this now
<Hat> is stream up
<Daz> RobotPinkie, it's newsfeed from 59 minutes ago. i'll copypasta it
<RobotPinkie> Aw, I bored Daz :(
<RobotPinkie> I found Cheerilee and Lily Blossom, btw :3
<Daz> epic. I hope to get the 4set with CMC and Cheerie
<Daz> http://www.facebook.com/Sonic?ref=ts
<Daz> here's that sonic thing
<Daz> reason i'm online is sorting stuff out - i'm gonna be recording FiM in spanish (even thou from what i've seen the dubs suck : /) from episode 2 or 3 onwards, editing them into 720p vids, and uploading to youtube. SOMEpony had to upload the spanish versions :3
<RobotPinkie> I want that CMC set too, but I think it's gonna take a long time for it to get here :(
<Daz> i know :
<Daz> : / *
<RobotPinkie> and cool :P
<RobotPinkie> I'm kinda scrapping most of my projects, btw.
<RobotPinkie> or putting them on the shelf indefinitely, to be finished at the same time as Duke Nukem Forever.... oh wait
<Daz> Scrap them all until one remains. then don't do anything till that one's done.
<RobotPinkie> Eh, kinda, I'm keeping two projects.
<EmmettBrown> So,no help with my dielmma?
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, EmmettBrown, I've seen the Back to the Future movies a lot of times.
<RobotPinkie> but on the other hand they are awesome.
<EmmettBrown> The professor layton movie has puzzles for you to answer in it
<EmmettBrown> Which would be interesting in irc chat
<RobotPinkie> That's true.
<EmmettBrown> or whatever this is
<Luna> 07SUDDENLY!
<RobotPinkie> LOFN
*Luna nods
<RobotPinkie> :P
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<Luna> 07LURK mode OFFLINE http://i.imgur.com/hhtyK.png

*Luna gives hugs to RobotPinkie & Wrek
*Wrek hugs luna
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna back
*AllisZero pokerfaces.

<AllisZero> :|
<EspyLacopa> What, no Rarity hugs?
<Luna> 07http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrebhr8sf21qincmao1_500.jpg
<RobotPinkie> She's holding her phone with her wing?
<AllisZerofuuu> Well that was dumb.
<DecapPony> dat Luna lurking
<Luna> 07I know it's awesome right?
<AllisZerofuuu> Alright, let's see what I have for the afternoon...
*Luna is curious now
<EmmettBrown> Well,since the professor layton movie is one movie,and the back to the future trilogy(It's a quadrilogy now) is 3,maybe I'll save bttf for another time and ask for the professor layton movie.
<Purple`Prose> There's a Professor Layton movie?
<EmmettBrown> yep
<EmmettBrown> puzzles and everything
<AllisZerofuuu> Speaking of back to the future, did you guys see those Nike shoes going for 75000 dollars?
<EmmettBrown> I saw those
<Luna> 07Alright who owns left4dead2 and is up for a game with sleepy Luna?
<EmmettBrown> It the same technology as the wire reel in a vacuum cleaner
<Luna> 07don't be shy
<AllisZerofuuu> I would Luna, but I'm not at home and feel bad to play it at work :p
<Luna> 07aww
<bro> cool so BronyChat has its own irc server? :)
<Luna> 07yea I can understand that
<EmmettBrown> Theres also a professor layton pheonix wright crossover coming out
<Luna> 07We have our own domain too
<Luna> 07bronystate.net
<bro> guys I just watched my first episode of MLP this morning at 5:30am on TreeHouse. It felt like the season finale but it turned out it was actually the 2nd episode...
<Luna> 07hehehe
<AllisZerofuuu> Welcome to the goddamn herd.
<Luna> 07welcome brony!
<AllisZerofuuu> Enjoy your stay :)
<AllisZerofuuu> Welcome to the herd; here's your complimentary soda and shipping fic.
<bro> I was reading on the treehouse forums that people's children don't want to watch this show and run away screaming and crying from it. I thought that this was cool
<bro> My guess is that Darkness Moon and that zebra witch are too scary?
<Luna> 07Zecora scary?
<Luna> 07Hmmmmm
<Luna> 07nahhhh
<AllisZerofuuu> No, I think the children are more disturbed by their parents liking the cartoon more than they do
<RobotPinkie> Well, there are plenty more of awesome in the episodes you're yet to see, bro
<DecapPony> http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/09/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-evil-evil-villain-needs-a-hobby/
<bro> well I mean I haven't seen the zebra ep yet I just saw her profile on the wiki with the glowing eyes and sith good
<bro> *hood
<DecapPony> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-haters-will-be-in-the-process-of-hating.gif
<bro> wait if dr. evil is holding rarity who is mini me holding...
<bro> oh sweetybelle
<AllisZerofuuu> Lul Squirtle
<mib_n4b78e> What's with the new 3rd Stream service?
<DecapPony> haters gonna hate
<RobotPinkie> All the episodes are still up on Youtube for now, bro :D
<DecapPony> yfw they have been taken down by Habsro
<Rainbow_Dash> Yes.. Luna, that hugs picture made my day. Thanks :P
<RobotPinkie> again?
<bro> I wouldn't mind Hasbro being a bitch about taking them down if they made it more available...
<bro> are they evne selling S1 on dvd yet?
<Rainbow_Dash> No, sadly
<NewDCD> okay guys
<Rainbow_Dash> I hope they do soon, and perhaps on Blu-Ray
<bro> because the only time I can see it in Canada is 5:30am mondays and 6:30pm wednesdays. It's not flexible
<NewDCD> almost to the hospital
<NewDCD> Time to bring joy to kids with HIV!
<RobotPinkie> Nope, episodes are still up!
<bro> seeing ep 2 convinced me I want it all
<RandomExtra> Yay!
<bro> ... http://www.equestriagaming.com/2011/09/equestria-tales.html I want
<RobotPinkie> This should be the whole series in one playlist. http://miburl.com/j16UL8
<DecapPony> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-spike-watches-it-for-the-plot1.jpg
<Rainbow_Dash> RobotPinkie, how about this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_629523&src_vid=Vnelx6VLm9Y&v=ueWZBsrfPsk&feature=iv
<Flutteryay> John Madden!
<DecapPony> UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Wrek> 05no spamming decap
<AllisZerofuuu> Tiny equines that are in my possession
<AllisZerofuuu> Nice play of words there
<RobotPinkie> Well, that's also good Rainbow_Dash
<bro> so I was thinking, the difference in animation smoothness from the first 80s ponies is kinda similar to comparing G1 transformers right? but it could be a good source of plot
<RobotPinkie> I kinda prefer having a playlist, though.
<bro> I want MLP to buy the rights to use Kleo the Misfit Unicorn, she's a horned pegasus / winged unicorn too like the princesses
<Flutteryay> I ASM THE DUCK IN THE DICK MOBILE!
<Flutteryay> I AM THE DUCK IN THE DICK MOBILE!
<EmmettBrown> So,I suppose I'll go with the professor layton movie,only problem is I'm not sure if it's an A movie or a B movie
<Rainbow_Dash> If I got picked, I would choose Howl's Moving Castle
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<EspyLacopa> good lord. A youtube vid of the entire first season?
<EmmettBrown> Plus we might have some confused americans,the film has luke's european voice actor
<Rainbow_Dash> Yes
<EspyLacopa> Rainbow_Dash: I'd pick either Grave of the Fireflies or The Fantastic Adventures of Unico
<Flutteryay> Grave of the Fireflies... is a movie that everypony should see once
<Rainbow_Dash> Orly
<bro> if you had the first season as a single film like espy said, would that mean you would tkae out the start/end music?
<Flutteryay> Yeah.
<Rainbow_Dash> http://www.veoh.com/watch/v20393415WTQ3bYk3?h1=Howls+Moving+Castle+part+1
<Rainbow_Dash> Thats a small sample of Howls Moving Castle
<Rainbow_Dash> Its an anime movie
<bro> hm are we unable to connect here using pidgin? :(
<EmmettBrown> and you wouldn't understand it if you hadn't played the games up to the 4th one.
<EmmettBrown> Well,you probably would,but there are quite a few references to the series
<EmmettBrown> And it is implied that people are aten by sharks,wolves and fall to their deaths in it
<MrChang> hey everypony
<Rainbow_Dash> Hey
<EmmettBrown> But anyway,that will be my choice if I win the roll on friday/saturday
*LordCelstia crashed back to the earth
<LordCelstia> Im back from the moon everybody
<Pinkie_Pie> Try not to stay for to long
<LordCelstia> Why? what's going on
<Pinkie_Pie> Nothing, im just messing with you :P
<LordCelstia> :| Good thing im not im a moon-launching mood right now
<LordCelstia> lol
<DecapPony> there is an epidemic, thats whats going on
<LordCelstia> PARASPRITES!?
<DecapPony> nope
<DecapPony> flesh eating disease
<bro> man why does rainbow dash look so awesome after they unlock the keys to harmony
<LordCelstia> AHH
<bro> it's like she's being suspended by her power
<LordCelstia> Because, my subject... the elements are awesome
<LordCelstia> and she is awesome
<LordCelstia> awesome plus awesome equals more awesome
<EspyLacopa> I just spotted the spinny Celestia and Luna on Lauren Faust's deviantart favorites.
<bro> does anyone else predict there will be "Elements of Discord" minions who serve Discord?
<LordCelstia> I have a the answers. NO SPOILERS.
<bro> I think the people making it are going to put their pony personas somewhere into s2
<AllisZerofuuu> I hate dealing with Adobe licensing SOOO MUCH
<Flutteryay> I think you should take a seat over there
<Flutteryay> WOAH-OH! LIVIN' ON A PRAYER!
<AllisZerofuuu> Cant watch you, I'm asleep
<bro> so guys, Wild Fire http://sibsy.deviantart.com/#/d47xkjb
<bro> since Sabrina is the senior storyboard artist for MLP, we just gotta see WF right?
<LordCelstia> hey
<Rainbow_Dash> *gasp*
<AllisZerofuuu> Background character maybe
*EspyLacopa watches exclusive clip of season 2
<EspyLacopa> O.o
<bro> yeah I meant background, although maybe in season 3 she can race rainbow dash
<bro> because she is winged and fire makes me think fast
<bro> oh, anyone seen young justice?
<Rainbow_Dash> Discord confirmed for troll
<AllisZerofuuu> Adobe y u not pick up the phone when I call
<EspyLacopa> Rainbow_Dash: Those poor wings and horns.
<LordCelstia> I made my pony-sona to be rainbow dashs cousin just cuz i said so haha
<Flutteryay> LOL Discord...
<Flutteryay> Somepony needs to shoop the trollface on him
<GrimGallop> o.o
<Flutteryay> Seriously... hahaha...
<bro> q: is this fanservice? http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110912071442/mlp/images/f/ff/Saddleless_diamond_mint.png
<Flutteryay> Wait... Discord is Ghost
*LordCelstia sends Discord to the MOOOOOOOON
<LordCelstia> there ya go
<bro> Discord teamup with Nightmare Moon imminent
<bro> that or some supreme twist like Twilight being corrupted by dark magic
<bro> then luna can be all "you saved me now I'll return the favour" kinda thing
<LordCelstia> Oh no. fire the friendship rainbow lazers
*LordCelstia fires giant rainbow lazer of friendship
<bro> is it possible for them to remake care bears this awesome? I enjoyed that show
<LordCelstia> lol
<bro> in fact you could even have a crossover, carealot and equestria could coexist right
<LordCelstia> carealot is stupis
<LordCelstia> *stupid
<bro> dude, NoHeart
<bro> not to mention ColdHeart and DarkHeart
<LordCelstia> I have no desire to coexist with them
<bro> those were sweet villains
<AllisZerofuuu> I'm gonna be
<AllisZerofuuu> You know
<AllisZerofuuu> Back here.
<Rainbow_Dash> I kinda like Discord, that personality fits "Chaos"
<AllisZerofuuu> If you need me, call
<LordCelstia> They can taste the rainbow
<bro> who was it that was called the Prince of Discord?
<bro> I know someone had a title like that but I can't place it
<LordCelstia> Prince of Darkness?
<bro> either comics or some cartoon
<bro> no it was definitely discord...
<LordCelstia> google it.
<bro> can't find but I'm thinking this might have been in Rifts Conversion Book 2: Pantheons of the Megaverse
<LordCelstia> oooh
<RobotPinkie> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/165/535/40435%20-%20Sweetie_Belle%20meme%20soon.jpg
<LordCelstia> hey robot im back from the moon
<Wrek> 05nope
*Wrek sends LordCelstia to the moon
<Rainbow_Dash> I think I figured out who Discord is like
<Rainbow_Dash> Hades from hercules
*RobotPinkie sends the moon into the sun
<LordCelstia> No, you cant send me to the moon
<RobotPinkie> Ohay Wrek
<LordCelstia> you cant explain that
<Dashite> Hades was a great villain.
<RobotPinkie> Well, he just did.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he had a brilliant voice actor too, hades that is
<RobotPinkie> oh yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also although no one has gone too far yet, keep in mind some people wont want to watch the wired video
<RobotPinkie> That's like the one actor that was missing from True Romance...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so just be careful what you say before the premiere ;)
<LordCelstia> nope. cant explain me goin to moon, therefore science
<Dashite> There is a video?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see Dari script's post
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Wired released a short video clip from Season 2
<RobotPinkie> Not gonna watch, seen too much already.
<Dashite> Ah
<RobotPinkie> I want to fully enjoy Episode 1 in all its glory
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's on EqD, but again, be careful not to spoil anything for people who don't watch it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a good policy robot ;)
<RobotPinkie> and I don't mean the kind of Episode 1 that has Jar-Jar in it.
<prince-dari> I wonder if they have the ~T ban module installed on this network.
<prince-dari> I could ban the link.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, I don't think it's THAT bad to link it, so long as a warning is given
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that being said, ANY link during the BMN stream is prohibited :P
<RobotPinkie> except appropriate picture links, right?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes
<mib_fu7dwp> I noticed that you got a new streaming service for bronystate.net's theatre.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we did indeed anon
<LordCelstia> LOL this is off-topic and a joke from yesterday but I was just playing inFAMOUS 2 and I was about to launch a car into the sky and i turned to my friend and said "You know where I'm gonna send this car?" and he asks "Where?" and i shouted "TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNAAAAH" then after it exploded i yelled "BEEYEETCH!"
<mib_fu7dwp> Is there any special reason for it? (not objecting to it or anything, just curious)
<RobotPinkie> >from yesterday
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mostly because Veemi is lamesauce and we've been sick of it :P
<mib_fu7dwp> Ah.
<RobotPinkie> New streaming service seems pretty good, too
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, so far I'm liking the results
<RandomExtra> We won't have to reset it every time it goes back up, right?
<Dashite> I have yet to see anything on the new stream. :/
<RobotPinkie> Oh lawd, I <3 that Rarity dress
<ValtheJean> 2,14 give it time, all shall be revealed soon! mwahahahahaaha!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 in other words, be patient, we just want to make sure everything is perfect for S2 :P
<bro> so I saw Jar Jar on an episode of clone wars
<bro> he actually does a competent job of distracting the trade federation representative with his antics while obi-wan sneaks some cargo ships past a blockage
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Jar Jar does not exist
<ValtheJean> 2,14 period
<RobotPinkie> Who?
<RobotPinkie> olololol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 exactly :P
<Dashite> The episode where he pretends to be a Jedi right?
<bro> he's too far incorporated at this point, doesn't bother me
<bro> no he's the rep of naboo and... oh wait it wasn't obi-wan it was senator organa
<bro> like he juggles and stuff
<RobotPinkie> I once pointed out that that character which does not exist has a line in Episode 3 to a friend
<RobotPinkie> He wuz pretty mad, bro
<ValtheJean> 2,14 episode 3 also does not exist
<bro> he probably died during the sith extermination, he doesn't show up on nabu in ep 4 so can't people forgive him in death?
<bro> Clone Wars > Episode 3
<Dashite> Episode 3 is at least better than 1+2
<RobotPinkie> Eh, I kinda like Episode 2 and 3 =P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 forgive? no
<ValtheJean> 2,14 his death is justice
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you don't forgive a murderer when you finally inject the needle
<bro> this whole TCW series is just... better than the entire prequel trilogy
<Dashite> Also, Clone Wars is pretty cool, but the first Clone Wars series was better.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the CG or the cartoon?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because the CG is shit
<bro> I'm watching thinking "when is ahsoka going to die"
<Dashite> Both are good, but the cartoon was better.
<bro> noooo but <3 ahsoka tahno
<bro> and they actually humanize the clones and stuff which makes their abuse all the more tragic
<RobotPinkie> >yfw the Blu Ray release of Episode 4 has him in virtually every scene
<bro> WHAT
<RobotPinkie> >yfw Episode 4-6 are now all musicals featuring him
<Dashite> The CG one takes awhile to get going. By season 2 it's pretty good.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if that happens, I'm burning down Lucas' mansion
<Dashite> Star Wars 3D
<bro> Pinkie that has to be a lie, that'd be worse than shooping young Anakin over old Anakin in force ghost
<RobotPinkie> lawl
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I'm kidding, bro
<bro> or replacing puppet yoda with CG yoda
<RobotPinkie> wat? He's been completely replaced now?
<bro> definitely old>young force ghost has to be the worst, it's even worse than making han shoot 2nd
<Dashite> YFW they dub over James Earl Jones Vader with Hayden Christensen.
<RobotPinkie> Han never shot first, because Greedo didn't shoot.
<bro> the only person to shoot still shoots first
<Dashite> You know, there are people out there that have never seen Han shoot first.
<bro> also I love how Greedo is in The Clone Wars
<RobotPinkie> Han shot Greedo in cold blood, now that's a T-shirt I'd buy
<bro> and manages to escape and stuff
<RobotPinkie> No, the only person to shoot is the only person to shoot :P
<bro> Han probably knew Greedo's background in kidnapping and stuff so it's not as immoral as it seems
<bro> Greedo wasn't merely a bounty hunter for criminals, but an immoral merc
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, Han definitely knew Greedo WOULD shoot him if it continued on much longer...
<Dashite> Self defence, he feared fopr his life. Greedo had a gun pointed at him.
<bro> besides, didn't greedo's finger slip on the trigger as he collapsed or something?
<Dashite> Totally justified.
<bro> I think guys like Greedo and Chewie were ambiguous and we could have perceived them as being younger
<bro> but since they were both adults during the clone wars, they're freakin old by the time of the orig tril
<RobotPinkie> That's true... though I haven't seen the Clone Wars
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Robot: see the cartoon version
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's amazing
<RobotPinkie> I still want the new Star Wars blu rays though
<bro> I think I saw an ep or 2 of the 2d clone wars but not as much as the 3d
<Dashite> Cartoon > CGI, but CGI is still good.
<bro> I wish they'd come up with slightly different titles to call them by
<EspyLacopa> How about the old Reboot cartoon?
<DecapKing> i just want to eat my damn sammich
<RobotPinkie> I actually enjoy most of the improvements. My big problem is the stupid fucking musical number at Jabba's palace :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sorry, I hated the CGI
<bro> ITS A FIREWAAALLLL
<Dashite> EspyLacopa totally different conversation. :p
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the animation was blocky as shit, the voice actor's were terrible
<Dashite> YES BRO!
<bro> <3 AndrAIa
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and the writing...god awful
<Dashite> ValtheJean did you watch anything beyond the first couple episodes?
<bro> what do you mean 'was', isn't the cgi still airing Val? :)
<bro> 3rd season I believe
<bro> the writing is actually pretty good
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I watched a few of the first episodes, then watched a few of the second season
<RobotPinkie> I did not know about this...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 still hated it
<RobotPinkie> I thought there was a CGI movie
<Dashite> Well, at least you gave it a shot.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<bro> I liked that episode that focused on Zero the Hut and his girlfriend
<bro> that was great
<Dashite> The CGI movie was basically the first 3 episodes stiched together into a movie.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 despite my flaming egocentric appearance, I do actually treat things with an unbias prespective :P
<bro> yeah it was to introduce lolihka
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jnCcejkpjg <-- Have some leather pants
<bro> Val have you seen the Ziro the Hutt episode?
<Dashite> Hey, it's more than some people have done ValtheJean :p
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, I haven't seen that one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol :P
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wws7mnMewPw&ob=av3e
<bro> it's so good... clones and jedi die a lot in TCW, dark
<Dashite> Also, Firewall was best reboot episode.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I miss Reboot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that was such an awesome show
<Dashite> It was.
<bro> the only thing I disliked about reboot was the whole matrix/boob andraia thing
<Dashite> Heh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, though it did make me feel terrible every time I beat the computer at a game
<ValtheJean> 2,14 though I've gotta say, either that user sucked at games, or he lived a miserable life
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's like, he comes back from his meaningless job, goes on the computer, and gets his ass kicked
<Dashite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al6ssH4vkdY
<bro> that's assuming it was the same server, mainframe was connected to the net so it could have been an online game right?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 his wife leaves him because she can't be with a guy who can't play games
<ValtheJean> 2,14 his children rebel against him, as he has no authority
<RobotPinkie> Any stream today, btw?
<bro> I haven't sen anything here today just a swirling line
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he dives into the realm of alcoholism and lives the last twenty years of his life in a ditch
<ValtheJean> 2,14 though I may be extrapolating farther than I should ;)
<Dashite> My computer must look like a warzone after all these years. :(
<bro> you know what's freaky: the codemasters
<bro> they should have built on that concept more
<interior_gummy> THEY RELEASED DISCORD
<RobotPinkie> That sounds completely plausible, val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<interior_gummy> FUCK YEAH
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we know gummy, though as a reminder don't spoil anything for the people who chose not to watch it ;)
<interior_gummy> dammit, too late
<Dashite> "Ladies and gentlemen, Megabyte has left the building!"
<bro> Discord: Discover or Die
<interior_gummy> he's a...villain, let's say that
<Flutteryay> And at least two people on EqD are crying RUINED FOREVER! but the others are satisfied
<bro> oh, Enzo's birthday eh Dash
<ValtheJean> 2,14 seriously? people are complaining
<Flutteryay> Yes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 like...good grief...it had a warning
<interior_gummy> it's not what i expected, but great for a different reason
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I swear, I have no idea how people function on the internet without being able to READ
<bro> if we don't know what discord looks like yet, someone draw him as a disc + a cord
<EspyLacopa> Megabyte and Hexadecimal.
<bro> I bet he's a cyborg pony
<Flutteryay> I mean two people said they're not gonna watch the entire series ever again because they're so disappoiintede
<Flutteryay> teenagers most likely
<ValtheJean> 2,14 .......
<Dashite> IT'S A FIREWALL! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_903744xh8
<ValtheJean> 2,14 jesus christ...some people in this fandom are just LOOKING for excuses to be drama queens
<bro> Hex was hot, I don't know what I would do if that was my sis
<Flutteryay> Eeyup
<ValtheJean> 2,14 OH NOEZ, I KNOW WHAT DISCORD LOOKS LIKE NOW! MY LIFE IS RUINED
<bro> same with dot, why did matrix not tap that
<Flutteryay> but with a name like Latias4Ever what did you expect?
<interior_gummy> also, he has an awesome voice, just a different type of awesome
<ValtheJean> 2,14 agreed gummy :P
<Dashite> Bro, because she only had one boob in the first two seasons. :p
<Flutteryay> no it was I DON'T LIKE HOW DISCORD TURNED OUT! MY LIFE IS RUINED!
<EspyLacopa> ValtheJean: The fandom only has room for one drama queen, and that space is occupied quite firmly by Rarity.
<bro> based on how season 1 went, isn't discord probably only going to be in the first 2 episodes and get defeated?
<bro> and then the rest of the season is the ponies goofing around?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol bro
<interior_gummy> bro: probably
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm assuming that's what they're doing, but honestly we wont know until it comes out
<bro> and then it will turn out that discord is actually Luna's little brother
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<bro> I WAS MAD YOU TURNED MY SIS EVIL
<Flutteryay> Well, at least Discord isn't... well, some other alicorn they shoehorned in. I'm impressed with how he turned out actually
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and the cycle of Celestia-related characters showing up once and never appearing again continues
<ValtheJean> 2,14 careful
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no spoilers
<interior_gummy> at first i was like -_- but then i was like :D
<bro> yeah flutter I actually was picturing discord as an alicorn bro don't spoil my dream
<Flutteryay> don't worry, I'm b eing careful not to spoil
<bro> that was totally a spoiler
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I know, but it's my duty to remind everyone
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because the last thing we want is mudwars because someone let something slip
<bro> btw can we call enhanced ponies with both add-ons unipegasi?
<RobotPinkie> Spoiler: I like ponies.
<Dashite> All of you, shut up about ponies, we were talking about reboot! :p
<DecapKing> already done, called alicorn Bro
<EspyLacopa> NEVAH!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 btw, Sephiroth kills Aeris
<bro> alicorn doesn't have etymology I understand
<Dashite> Dammit ValtheJean! I haven't played that game yet!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 trololololo
<bro> of, if you guys want to see an amazing anime, Yakitate Japan, I cried
<interior_gummy> spoiler: he's the villain
<DecapKing> btw, Rainbow dash can fly
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but honestly, if you haven't played it yet, then you deserve to have it spoiled
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's like...such common knowledge
*RobotPinkie dives down from the ceiling and pierces ValtheJean with Masamune
<DecapKing> what game?
<Dashite> FF7
<bro> FF7
*ValtheJean drops the Holy materia
<bro> anyway aerith survives, yay
<DecapKing> i say fuck FF
*ValtheJean and then doesn't tell anyone thus drawing out the game for another 12 hours
<bro> a less known spoiler would be one regarding Kefka and Leo
<Dashite> I learned about it a long time ago. Don't really care. Have no interest in playing it anyway.
*ValtheJean which btw, was pointless because if I had said it to begin with Cloud would have stopped being such a god damn emo
<RobotPinkie> Damn you, Val!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 trolololololo
<prince-dari> Hey, guys, guys.
<bro> does cloud even talk?
<bro> I mean, Cecil and Terra talked, right?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and Dashite, I can understand not wanting to play FF
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but the older ones are some classics
<DecapKing> spoiler: Final Fantasy is wrong, it isnt final
<RobotPinkie> lawl prince-dari
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would say give it a try, but hey, to each his own
<bro> if we perceive FF as the final adventures of their respective separate worls it would work
<ValtheJean> 2,14 though not 7, I hate 7
<Dashite> ValtheJean JRPGs really aren't my thing.
<bro> except of course, for FF6 and 7 and 10 which got sequels
<ValtheJean> 2,14 6 never got a sequel...
<bro> or wait I mean FF4 not 6
<EspyLacopa> FF6 got a sequel?
<RobotPinkie> lol I love FF7
<prince-dari> Stream's up.
<DecapKing> what movie is the soylent green thing from?
<Dashite> Soylent Green
<RobotPinkie> It was rushed as all fuck, but the world was solid and had a ton of fun stuff to do in it
<bro> that sounds familiar but not sure...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 7 was only popular because it was a part of the first set of games that were willing to be raunchy
<Sumica> ello all.
<DecapKing> Spoiler: Dead Island has zombie sin it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and so people were like "LAWL THIS IS SO MATURE"
<DecapKing> *zombies in
<RobotPinkie> lol FF7 was raunchy?
<Dashite> Zombie sin?!
<bro> wow, I just downloaded 810 megabytes of the 21 bronycast episodes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dude, so much implied inuendo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's not even funny
<bro> FF7 had crossdressing and Cloud dating Barrett, so sure
<EspyLacopa> I think it was more it was the first 3D Final Fantasy, on the Playstation console, and had a HUGE marketing deal for it.
<RandomExtra> Is there any way to refresh the stream with this one? It isn't showing for me.
<RobotPinkie> There's only one spot where there's innuendo, and that's at the wall market
<Flutteryay> >implying implications
<bro> in terms of shockers though, nothing beats FF6 dealing with teen pregnancy
<bro> like wtf
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you might want to play it again robotpinkie
<EspyLacopa> FF6 had Opera. And the main villain successfully destroying the world.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 6 was and remains the best FF
<EspyLacopa> ...You're sure the stream is up?
<Dashite> I can't seem to get anything from the stream either.
<bro> I thought Zeromus also destroyed the world
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah dari, I'm not getting any stram
<ValtheJean> 2,14 stream*
*EspyLacopa is at http://bronystate.net/theatre/
<GrimGallop> *Kefka laugh*
<Sumica> 6? I thought it was 3 that did that =p
<bro> and he had more HP than kef
<prince-dari> Oh.
<bro> stfu your american numbers
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, there are places you could read stuff into, like when Cloud crashes into the church, but I wouldn't call that "innuendo"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, oh you sumica :P
<RandomExtra> Oh, so it isn't just me.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but come on, Kefka is such a brilliant villain
<EspyLacopa> Zeromus. . .who was he again?
<bro> if you want innuendo, how about KH's whole keyblade thing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 FF4 main villain
<EspyLacopa> Kefka, psycho clown extraordinaire.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, store-wise FF6 is superior, definitely
<EspyLacopa> Oh, right. the main villain out of nowhere who lives on the moon. >_>
<GrimGallop> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
<Sumica> I thought kefka was't that bad as a villen till saw what he looked like on the psx remastered version of 6
<RobotPinkie> It just doesn't have as much fun stuff to do in it :P
<bro> as opposed to espers found in another dimension?
<EspyLacopa> Which you had to ride a giant whale to get to.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and lol, the irony is that the game with a shitload of characters had, THE BEST CHARACTERS
<bro> what the heck is wrong with an alien intelligence?
<bro> and the great whale was just the name of the ship, it's not actually a whale
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm so sick that they keep shortening the amount of characters you have
<bro> Zeromus = Cthulu
<DecapKing> Fallout New Vegas Spoiler: Mr. House is 300 something years old
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they're just lazy
<EspyLacopa> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 6 had, what 13 characters?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and aside from like, Umaro, all of them were really well done
<bro> it had so many you had to split them into 3 groups in the final level
<EspyLacopa> 14 I think.
<bro> I just try to think of Umaro as being to Mog what Interceptor is to Shadow
<EspyLacopa> You're forced to make three parties for the final dungeon.
<bro> except I think even interceptor had better char dev than Umaro
<RobotPinkie> The end of the world was really awesome in FF6
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, agreed bro
<EspyLacopa> You can't even /reach/ the final dungeon if you have fewer than 3 characters in your party.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh god...I've read SO many theories about saving shadow or leo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not a single one worked
<bro> I mean he freaking leaps in the way as a shield to protect shad, <3s relm, etc
<RobotPinkie> wat?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 really got my hopes up
<bro> what do you mean save shadow?
<DecapKing> Spoiler: The 'end of the world' was best in Fallout universe
<bro> saving him is easy, you just wait
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nonono
<RobotPinkie> >implying shadow was hard to save
<Sumica> You did't save him Val?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 at the end
<EspyLacopa> Shadow dies at the end of the game.
<bro> omg
<ValtheJean> 2,14 when he commits suicide
<bro> I never saw that, did that add that in the PS2 version?
<RobotPinkie> Ahh, that's what you mean.
<DecapKing> Spoiler:Shadow commits suicide
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's always there
<EspyLacopa> It's quite possible, and easy, to save him during the floating continent bit.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 his ending for FF6 is him staying behind to redeem himself
<bro> I have to admit: I got to the tower of ruin but my game got deleted while I was grinding to 99 so I never beat kefka
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not talking about floating continent
<DecapKing> Spoiler:Floating continents are in Final Fantasy
<Sumica> oh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 bro....that really sucks
<EspyLacopa> Only way to not have Shadow die for keeps in FF6 is to save him on the continent, and then to not recruit him again during the World of Ruin section of the game.
<RobotPinkie> Spoiler: Shadow is a ninja
<bro> Ninjas always escape, Shadow = SnakeEyes
<MRDRPROFBRONY> capslock name bitches
<DecapKing> Spoiler:Final Fantasy will never stop, so it is never final
<ValtheJean> 2,14 man, they really should have drawn that out more though
<EspyLacopa> Of course, without Shadow you can't one-shot Kefka in the final fight by throwing Excalibur at him.
<WhatPayne> Hey RobotPinkie, planning to check out the Firefly?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I can still remember when I first noticed Relm could wear Shadow's pendant
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, WhatPayne, just not right now
<bro> Espy I just realized, Shadow is Gilgamesh
<bro> or Archer-class at least
<EspyLacopa> ?
<RobotPinkie> once the next test is over for school I'll probably start watching it, WhatPayne
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's what Dissidia needed
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Shadow
<EspyLacopa> Gilgamesh is a different character entirely. He's got like. . .6 arms.
<WhatPayne> No of course not. I just wondered if you still remember our last nights small convo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it depends on which FF you're talking about
<bro> I meant Fate/stay night's Gilgamesh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the one you're refering to Espy is from 5
<MRDRPROFBRONY> so... i finally decided to check fallout equestria
<RobotPinkie> Oh, lol yeah that I do, WhatPayne :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 or if you really want to get technical, Gilgamesh is an ancient Mediterranian hero (dear god how do you spell that)
<WhatPayne> I for one am sitting and waiting for good opportunity to watch first season of Dr. Who myself
<MRDRPROFBRONY> then i found an audio book
<MRDRPROFBRONY> multitasking for the win
<RobotPinkie> >mfw I get all excited about a new Ratchet & Clank game coming out.... and then it looks like crap
<bro> regardless of what he is in, I assume Gilgamesh is the same guy
<RobotPinkie> :(
<bro> so the Gilgameshes from FF series are also Fate/stay's Gilgamesh
<EspyLacopa> WhatPayne: The William Hartnell, The First Doctor?
<WhatPayne> uh... I believe it's the 2005 season one.
<DecapKing> This is why I like fallout games better, you almost never have charecters from past games actually show up in the later games, just references, except for dogmeat who you can recruit in Fallout 2 from the Cafe of Broken Dreams
<GrimGallop> You know what they say about assuming~
<MRDRPROFBRONY> i know that feel robotpinkie
<MRDRPROFBRONY> i was exited too
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Decap: the only thing that stays consistent is the names
<bro> assuming = awesomeing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they are NEVER the same character
<bro> we could take the Tsubasa Chronicle approach, that they're all versions of each other in different dimensions
<DecapKing> I still prefer Fallout, I just find it fascinating to see post apocalyptic America
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, I don't like that :P
<WhatPayne> You see I have not ever (until one recent hub stream stress test) watched Dr. Who really. And don't know much about the series
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I prefer to see it as the game developers see it: completely different games with the names being the same out of homage to the game that saved them from brankruptcy
<bro> you know what's odd is, reading about darth plaguis and stuff, I don't think the sith are evil
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the sith aren't evil
<bro> it doesn't seem evil to want physical immortality rather than the ghost immortality the jedi pursue
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which is a common misconception
<RobotPinkie> Oh well, there are still 2 good ones for PS3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nor are Jedi good
<bro> if the jedi were trying to kill me for wanting to save my life and the lives of ones I love, I'd want to purge them too
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Jedi are meant to be true neutral, in that they weigh everything equally with no emotion
<Sumica> Thought the only real carry thought in FF was bigs wedge and sid.
<bro> Jedi = Taliban
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sith are merely force-wielders who rely on emotions
<bro> you can't weigh anything without emotion, it's the foundation of values and morality
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they are considered evil because the factions themselves to not get along
<WhatPayne> Someone tell me which I should do first. Finish off the first Mass Effect, or start Deus Ex?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not to the Jedi
<Dashite> Finish
<bro> the Jedi are deluding themselves, and history has proven that it's imperfect
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Beginning of the Jedi code: "There is no emotion, there is peace"
<bro> what is their motivation to preserve life and peace to begin with, if not an emotional connection to it?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they don't preserve life, they balance it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they keep things in order
<EspyLacopa> Jedi are Druids?
<WhatPayne> Well Dashite says finish. I'll trust that opinion.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eh...it's a stretch but I'll accept the metaphor
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because druids act out of a divine connection to nature
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which, in itself, is a "love-like" emotion
<bro> Jedi ideals seem kinda buddhist-like, but while it's good to not let emotions carry you away, desiring to be void of them leaves one to question what motivates will
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that is a much more acceptable metaphor to me
<bro> balance is also subjective, trying to wipe out the sith doesn't sound balanced
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the jedi don't wipe out the sith, however, that is why the sith will always exist
<WhatPayne> George Lucas butchered the Star Wars with episodes 1, 2 & 3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the sith try to exterminate the Jedi, the jedi merely defend themselves as is appropriate
<RobotPinkie> Man I love that new unrelated to spoiler pic on EqD http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0tho2PxKRn8/Tm06djfwPiI/AAAAAAAAL9k/5ASqNHM8Y_4/s1600/56541+-+Marisa_Kirisame+Master_Spark+Touhou+artist+bux+blue_eyes+cosplay+earth_pony+hat+pinkie_pie+spark+witch_hat.png
<ValtheJean> 2,14 aaaaaaand dead chat
<RobotPinkie> NNNNOOOO
<Sumica> Still not seeing any stream here.
<RobotPinkie> You blew it up!
<RobotPinkie> This chat needs 76% more Steven_Magnet
<WhatPayne> I shall not watch that season 2 clip!... Or should I?
<Sumica> I plan on not watching it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 watch it or not, that is your decision. If you DO watch it, respect others for not watching it and be careful of spoilers
<RobotPinkie> I plan on watching the episode here next Saturday
<WhatPayne> On one hand I'd really like to watch it as the wait is unbearable, but on other hand I don't want to spoil myself.
*GrimGallop still sees no stream
<RobotPinkie> What happen to stream, prince-dari?
<prince-dari> DCD didn't give us the stream links it seems. >_>
<RobotPinkie> Ahhh
<GrimGallop> Snapz
<GrimGallop> Also, did the conversation topic magically change from FF to Star Wars while I was checking out Star Wars: The Old Republic? o.o
<WhatPayne> So will there be any streams tonight?
<RobotPinkie> Look at The Old Republic, now back at me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, eeyup grim
<RobotPinkie> THE TOPIC IS NOW DIAMONDS!
<GrimGallop> Diamonds?!
<Aristeo> rawr!
*Aristeo dings
<Aristeo> online :3
<WhatPayne> They are the girl's best friend
<RobotPinkie> I dunno... Neil Diamond?
*GrimGallop makes a pickaxe out of diamonds
<Charles> mew
<GrimGallop> Neil Peart.
<WhatPayne> No stream tonight? ----> Haha, time to finish ME1
*RobotPinkie makes a pickaxe out of diamonds, then uses it to hack into the Minecraft servers to get the latest nightly build
<Sumica> the five diamonds
<RobotPinkie> Mass Effect?
<WhatPayne> Yes
<RobotPinkie> that reminds me, I haven't finished ME2...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good choice whatpayne
<ValtheJean> 2,14 2012 is just around the corner :P
<Sumica> Spoiller fem shep is better.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 really Robot? dude....FINISH IT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ME2 was a wonderful game
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I know, it just requires so much time :P
<DecapKing> ME2 was good
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<WhatPayne> Plan is to go through 1&2 just for the third
<DecapKing> I finished it in a day
<RobotPinkie> I absolutely love the new battles, though... so much more intense
*VioletVanilla disregards Mass Effect, acquires Battlefield 3~
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Flootershy~
*EspyLacopa wants a pickaxe made of stars.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 A recommendation:
<WhatPayne> Oh Battlefield 3 that's another must. But only for PC
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if you're getting only one DLC, get Overlord
*RobotPinkie ponypounces VioletVanilla
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that was phenominally well done atmosphere wise
<Fluttershy> Hi VioletVanilla... :3
<DecapKing> I want Battlefield 3.....
*VioletVanilla is ponypounced~ :3
<DecapKing> Hey Fluttershy
<Dashite> Shadow Broker > Overlord
<VioletVanilla> 6I played the Alpha!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and ohai violet
<RobotPinkie> lol I got ME2 for PS3, it's already got all the DLC I think :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dashite: meh, I didn't like Overlord
*GrimGallop glomps Fluttershy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 too much Liara
<RobotPinkie> and before you ask, yes I did play ME1 for Xbox 360
<Dashite> You mean Shadow Broker...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, that's what I meant
*Fluttershy is glomped, falls over. "Ahhhh...' >>; N-Not today, Grimmmy...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 brain is fuzzled right now, doing lots of stuff
<WhatPayne> I played first BF1942 when it came out and loved it. I played BF2 when it came out and loved it. And I will play BF3 when it comes out and love it
<Sumica> Overloard was a hell of alot better then the last one... what was it countdown.
<Dashite> All the DLC disappointed me in the same way that the base game did. Your party was way too damn silent.
<VioletVanilla> 6I was about to say Val. . . I may be very very tired but I think you got it backwards~ ;3
<GrimGallop> D:
<Dashite> The Arrival.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<bro> oh, anyone else looking forward to Tribes: Ascend?
<Dashite> Which was so stupid.
<GrimGallop> Potato? ^_^
<VioletVanilla> 6WhatPayne, you will ADORE BF3. I promise it. I played the Alpha and it was entirely 10000000% enjoyable.
<Dashite> I'm following Tribes, Firefall and Planetside.
<WhatPayne> But now enough the talk about these games or I will never be able to double click that ME1 icon.
<RobotPinkie> I really enjoy ME2 so far, I can tell they were inspired by Demon's Souls
<LordCelstia> Ive returned from the moon
<Sumica> Yeah the only good thing about Arrival was it's the set up for 3
<Dashite> RobotPinkie WAT?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I hated arrival
<WhatPayne> VioletVanilla: Did you play it for console or PC?
<DecapKing> Violet how did you get to play the alpha?
<GrimGallop> LordCelstia, you're missing a vowel
<VioletVanilla> 6Fluttershy, PM please.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 was complete shit, and a waste of my money
<LordCelstia> huh?
<RobotPinkie> They were, Dashite. Not joking.
<Dashite> How so?
<VioletVanilla> 6PC, consoles are. . . below my standards~ ;D
<LordCelstia> oh u
<LordCelstia> lol
<LordCelstia> HEY
<WhatPayne> Oh thank god
<FluttershyLuver> .....llllllll
<Dashite> VioletVanilla: part of PC master race. :p
<bro> dashite: 2845 was tragic tease eh
<RobotPinkie> Much more punishing difficulty, more need to use cover, and so on
<LordCelstia> fluttershylover
<LordCelstia> fo you love fluttershy
<RobotPinkie> ME1 you could easily just breeze through without dying.
<WhatPayne> Only reason I have consoles is because there are few games not available for PC
<FluttershyLuver> the quiet ones are the evil ones
<VioletVanilla> 6I was invited by EA in partnership with DICE. Played it for an entire weekend.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, that's because ME1's combat system was a joke
<LordCelstia> >>
<LordCelstia> <<
*VioletVanilla got a knife kill.
<LordCelstia> :|
<Fluttershy> o-o; hmmm?
<Dashite> I'm not sure that means they were inspired by Demon's Souls. :/
<Sumica> RobotPinkie I dout you played it on the hardist setings then.
*LordCelstia [AK-47] AlltheJean
*SilverMane glomps Fluttershy
*Dashite runs over VioletVanilla in a tank
<LordCelstia> damn it didnt work out
<Sumica> where things could one shot you
<DecapKing> all i can say to that VioletVanilla is FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
*LordCelstia [AK-74u] DecapKing
*Fluttershy is glomped yet again, eeps. e-e; "Ahhh...."
<Dashite> Sumica, ME1 on hardest? Still easy.
<SilverMane> Dashite, what is this about Demon's Souls?
*GrimGallop glomps Silvermane
<RobotPinkie> As in one of the designers on the project literally said so, Dashite.
*SilverMane dodges
*GrimGallop faceplants
<Dashite> SilverMane, RobotPinkie was saying that ME2 was influenced by Demon's Souls.
<Sumica> Oh Hi Fluttershy
*DecapKing artillery VioletVanilla, Silvermane, LordCelestia, Fluttershy
<SilverMane> Demon's Souls was released in 2009
<VioletVanilla> 6Dashite. I will get you with the C4 I strapped to my helichopter~
<RobotPinkie> or maybe that was for ME3? lol
<Dashite> Uh oh...
<VioletVanilla> 6WHATPAYNE THERE ARE JETS! 8DD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that was probably it robot :P
<DecapKing> VioletVanilla, you have to strap it to the humvee or dune buggy
<Dashite> ME3? MOAR LIKE ME2.5 AMIRITE?!
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I always get games over a year late :P
<VioletVanilla> 6YU AR RITE~
<WhatPayne> In Battlefield 3? I'd hope so. There were planes and tanks and ships in Bf1942 and Bf2
<SilverMane> Fluttershy, what is the uppers with ya'l
<RobotPinkie> Well, ME2 uses the ME3 engine on PS3
<DecapKing> I still want to be able to make people rage by just sitting in the SAM missile launchers XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 um...what?
<RobotPinkie> though not for gameplay, just graphically
<Fluttershy> huh..?
<WhatPayne> And I really hope that BF3 will at some point release mod tools.
<SilverMane> huh what
<ValtheJean> 2,14 how can ME2 use ME3's engine...ME3 hasn't even been released...
<Fluttershy> =_=;
<VioletVanilla> 6WhatPayne: Ja~ It was fantastisch!
<AllisZerofuuu> I return
<RobotPinkie> Graphics engine for ME3 is revamped
<DecapKing> Who?
<AllisZerofuuu> Hi Violet, Val
<WhatPayne> VioletVanilla, ever played bf1942?
<Flutteryay> elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele! elele!
<DecapKing> I played the 360 version of it
<Flutteryay> HAHAHAHA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay, so that means ME3 is using ME2's engine, that's a very different statement :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ohai allis
<RobotPinkie> ...no, Val
<Charles> how was your day Ari?
<RobotPinkie> ME2 for PS3 was released much later
*SilverMane glomps Fluttershy again. "BECAUSE I CAN"
*DecapKing gently hugs Fluttershy
<WhatPayne> Bf1942 had the most brilliant mod called Forgotten Hope
<Dashite> ValtheJean, not quite. They made modifications to it for ME3 and those modifications made it into ME2 for PS3 because it was released so much later.
*LordCelstia [AK-47] Silvermane
<DecapKing> I might have to check it out WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> Yes, Dashite
<Fluttershy> Noo, not the glompz... T^T Not when I feel so sick.. blargh
<VioletVanilla> 6Of course Payne! ;3 The original is one of the only ones you can do an upside down plane, rocket theirs, and then land back in it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, that's just stupid then. ME2 on the PS3 sucked ass
<bro> Hot Wheels! Battle Force 5! Gotta fight together to survive! Never give up, never give in, we're gonna drive, Battle Force Five!
*DecapKing [Artillery] LordCelestia
<RobotPinkie> lolwhy, ValtheJean?
<WhatPayne> Well there is Forgotten Hope 2 for Bf2 as well
<RobotPinkie> I'm playing it on PS3, it's working fine
<GrimGallop> Anyone in here have levels of paladin?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 from what I read, it had stuttering issues, as well as missing content
<Dashite> Everyone knows that Console ME is worst ME. Doesn't matter if it's on PS3 or 360. :p
<WhatPayne> Oh right. I never done that plane rocket jump thing-y. But had bucketloads of fun just playing it online
*LordCelestia [M4A1 Carbine] Dashite
<RobotPinkie> Haven't experienced any stuttering, missing content would srsly suck though.
<Dashite> He shot me and then left. :/
*DecapKing [F-18] LordCelestia
<WhatPayne> Dashite, which is why I bought ME1 for PC
<LordCelestia> im still here...
*LordCelestia Respawns
<Dashite> Oh!
<Dashite> It was LordCelstia, not LordCelestia.
<GrimGallop> A level 6+ paladin can use Remove Disease as a spell-like ability once per week, Fluttershy~
<WhatPayne> Actually someone suggested the game for me in DevianArt.
<Sumica> Poor Fluttershy, you should be resting if you are sick. Not hanging out with crazy glomp happy ponies.
<RobotPinkie> I've only gotten one game on PS3 which I regret not getting for 360 :P
<WhatPayne> And I was like, huh... Gotta try that.
<RobotPinkie> and that's Ghostbusters
<Fluttershy> =_=; Well, at least it's not happening in real life, though even thinking of being glomped makes me feel a bit queasy... sigh.
*GrimGallop begins with random D&D references
<RobotPinkie> PS3 version's graphics are much worse, and the framerate still isn't even close to on 360.
<WhatPayne> But there are few games that are the reasons I have consoles. Halo, Metal Gear Solid and Uncharted.
<RobotPinkie> Seriously pissed me off that Sony got an exclusivity deal for it in Europe :(
<GrimGallop> Well, in that case...
<Dashite> NHL12. :) Eee! It's on it's way to me as we speak! :D
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie: What exclusivity?
*GrimGallop shouts, "SOUP! The cure for ALL ailments!"
<RobotPinkie> Ghostbusters, WhatPayne
*LordCelestia [MOON CANNON] DecapKing
<LordCelestia> i spelled it wrong earlier
<LordCelestia> i just refreshed th page haha
<LordCelestia> And i was like OATMEAL? are you crazy?
<LordCelestia> oh.
<LordCelestia> nvm...
<LordCelestia> Anybody wanna be sent to the moon?
<LordCelestia> im in a mood sending atitude
<RobotPinkie> it was exclusively for PS3 here for a long time
<WhatPayne> Oh, right.
<Fluttershy> LordCelestia I am not in moon sending mood sadly... >:
<RobotPinkie> and PS3 version is much, much worse
<RobotPinkie> still a good game, but I feel tricked :P
<WhatPayne> Any Halo fans here? (and I mean the singleplayer not the multiplayer)
<LordCelestia> Okay, but are you in a banana mood Fluttershy? i have some bananas here. in my banana bag
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oiy...when will that meme die?
<RobotPinkie> I love Halo 1&2 singleplayer, WhatPayne
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's not even that funny of a video
<Dashite> RAAAGE! Stop sending me campus jobs!
<Fluttershy> -thinks about bananas, sticks out her tongue- ...no, sorry...
<RobotPinkie> Halo 3 made me rage a whole lot
<Sumica> It will never die.
<LordCelestia> ok well good
<WhatPayne> Sweet. Halo is my absolute favorite game series.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it should :P
<LordCelestia> cause you aint findin any bananas
<WhatPayne> Why is that RobotPinkie?
<Sumica> In fact I am supprised magneto hasent showed up yet.
<LordCelestia> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
*LordCelestia launches Fluttershy to the moon
<LordCelestia> BEEYETCH!
<RobotPinkie> Because of the AI, WhatPayne... I might have been extremely unlucky, but they kept driving me over cliffs and into walls
<RobotPinkie> TWICE the game had a checkpoint right when I went over a cliff because of the stupid AI
<WhatPayne> Oh, I don't really mind that. Sure it's problem, but I only play Halo for it's plot.
<LordCelestia> Aw i feel sorry for Fluttershy
*Fluttershy is launched to the moon. "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH..." Fluttershy then splats against the surface.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 halo....plot
*LordCelestia goes and gently carries Fluttershy down back to earth
<ValtheJean> 2,14 aha...haha....ahahaha....AHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAAH
<WhatPayne> Oh halo has so massive plot
<Fluttershy> -teary eyed now- "Why did... did you launch me in the first place?!"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh god I'm crying from all this laughter
<RobotPinkie> Cortana, you mean?
*GrimGallop casts Revenance on Fluttershy
<LordCelestia> BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
<WhatPayne> It's round and firm with nice finish
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the only game that has less plot than Halo is Gears of War
<RobotPinkie> lol u so meen, ValtheJean
*LordCelestia and Fluttershy dramatically hufg THE END :D
<LordCelestia> *hug
<Dashite> ValtheJean Tetris?
<WhatPayne> ValtheJean: ever read the books?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sigh....smart ass
<Dashite> Oh!
<Dashite> Solitaire!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 books do not fucking count, period
<RobotPinkie> lol :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fucking self-published bastards
<Fluttershy> >> wait... you launch ponies out of love now? That's new...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ruining the god damn industry
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I thought there was a very good cinematic feel to the Halo games
<prince-dari> Lawl, Val y u so elitist.
<WhatPayne> You see I love Halo for it's plot (and that does not mean hindquarters)
<LordCelestia> Yep. now when i liek someone, imma send them to the moon
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dari, unless you've read the Halo books you can't fucking talk
<LordCelestia> ROMANTIC IS IT NOT?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's appaling
<prince-dari> I don't play Halo.
<prince-dari> So I wouldn't have read the books.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay, then don't call me elitist :P
<RobotPinkie> lol you are kind of elitist about literature, ValtheJean :P
<WhatPayne> I know a whole lot of people don't like Halo for the same reason I don't like Call of Duty
<RobotPinkie> Not that I'm complaining
<LordCelestia> EPIC FLUTTERSHY SINGING http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zPQTTE7yE8&feature=related
<WhatPayne> Simply because its too big. But I look past that.
<EspyLacopa> Wait. Waitwait wait. . .wait.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm only elitist about literature because of how far we've lowered our standards
<EspyLacopa> Halo has a /plot/?
<RobotPinkie> I bet you hate Steven King, ValtheJean :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 depends on his works
<WhatPayne> Yes it does... Well not so much plot, but rich thought out universe.
<RobotPinkie> or is it Stephen?
<RobotPinkie> I dunno what you've read of his books.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 though honestly, he's a much better magazine writer than he is a novel author
<VioletVanilla> 6Dear sweet Pinkie's baked bads ): Val. . .
<RobotPinkie> I really enjoyed The Stand and Insomnia
<WhatPayne> Are we still talking about Halo?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wut violet?
<RobotPinkie> lol if you like
<Dashite> Obviously you guys haven't spent enough time online. Halo has so much plot...
<RobotPinkie> I like the plot of Halo 1, in a sense.
<WhatPayne> Yeah. Halo 3 was not as good as Halo 2 nor Halo 1
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah Dashite. Remember that time when Master Chief tea-bagged that Covenant spy?
<RobotPinkie> It is very well paced
<Dashite> God dammit ValtheJean! I tried to tell him I wasn't a spy!
<RobotPinkie> and by the time you get to chapter 7 or whatever it is, and The Flood starts coming... wow
<WhatPayne> Indeed. Halo would still be brilliant even without it's sequels. It can stand on its own legs
<EspyLacopa> I always assumed that Halo was a game wherein you found enemies and then shot them until they stopped moving.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, I like you espy :P
<RobotPinkie> I mean that chapter, with the Flood, that was one of the most intense gaming experiences I've ever had
<Fluttershy> SilverMane.... =-=
<RobotPinkie> I felt high by the time I got to the next chapter
<Dashite> Halo loses because it contains the Library
<WhatPayne> EspyLacopa: That's because you skipped the cut-scenes did you not?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sorry, but the intensity of action does not equate to plot
<EspyLacopa> the what now? I must admit, I have never actually played Halo.
<EspyLacopa> Last FPS I played was the first Half-Life game
<RobotPinkie> No, it doesn't, but there are elements of good storytelling in it
<SilverMane> yes Fluttershy?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh what a cruel world this i
<WhatPayne> Oh hell yes brother man RobotPinkie. The swamp. That was so ominous. And you had no idea the Covenant would not be your only enemy.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 is* even
<Fluttershy> SilverMane you are not in the usual rooms... >>;
<RobotPinkie> You don't think pacing is part of a good story, Val? :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if there were a God, he would be a massive troll, for the amounts of pain he causes me
<SilverMane> I know Fluttershy. Just taking a break for the moment.
<RobotPinkie> lol you are such a troll, Val :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 pacing? going from shooting things every 10 seconds as opposed to every 2 seconds is not good pacing
<WhatPayne> And even the Library level anyone hates for its repetition. Was brilliant in my opinion, hard as hell but brilliant
<Fluttershy> SilverMane: oh....
<WhatPayne> *everyone
*SilverMane hugs Fluttershy.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, didn't like the Library either, but the chapter before was great so I can forgive that.
<WhatPayne> And in the end, isn't almost all fps games those where you simply shoot enemies upon enemies?
*Fluttershy is hugged, purses her lip. "There's just so many ponies in here..." >>;
<RobotPinkie> You really think that's all there is to it, Val?
*SilverMane escorts Fluttershy to a PM chat
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the cutscenes were typical action movie shots. There was nothing redeeming about that
<EspyLacopa> I kinda figured that was why the games have remained popular: Multiplayer, wherein you toss a bunch players on a map and they start killing each other.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I will recognize Halo for it's part in being the first modern shooter
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but I will never consider it good story telling
<WhatPayne> ValtheJean, again you can say that for pretty much any fps out there.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nope
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Half-Life 2
<RobotPinkie> Containing elements of good storytelling and being good storytelling are different things...
<Dashite> HL2 is boring. :/
<EspyLacopa> Is ep3 of Half Life 2 out yet?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 then you fail at life Dashite, there is nothing more to say :P
<WhatPayne> Half-Life 2 is my second or third best game after Halo, so I can't argue with that
<Dashite> Valve can go jump off a bridge. There are only so many times I can sit trapped in a room unloading all my ammo into the face of NPCs who just don't know when to shut up.
<EspyLacopa> I had much fun playing Counter-Strike back in college on the campus network.
<RobotPinkie> I do prefer Killzone 2&3 to the Halo games though, but the story is atrocious in KZ2
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, agreed robot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but damn it those guns are so fun to fire
<WhatPayne> Overall Half-Life 2 does the storytelling better than Halo. But I still prefer the Halo
<Dashite> I got through HL2 once. Can't stand playing it again.
<Tony> is it offline or did we crash it?
<EspyLacopa> Of course, now if I want to play counter-strike I have to actually /pay/ for it.
<Dashite> Offline
<RobotPinkie> I once spent ten minutes just stabbing that stupid cockhead Rico in the face because he's so goddamn stupid :P
<Tony> k
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's offline tony, no one is streaming
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol IKR?
<WhatPayne> I hate counterstrike.
<VioletVanilla> 6Dashite. We need to
<RobotPinkie> but yeah, gameplay is amazing in KZ2&3
<WhatPayne> I also Hate Halo's, multiplayer.
<VioletVanilla> 6COMMAND UND CONQUER!!!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 haven't played 3 yet, but I want to
<Dashite> :D
<WhatPayne> VioletVanilla, Dashite, Don't forget me!
<Dashite> I have to leave for class in a little bit. :(
<RobotPinkie> Highly recommended, much less annoying story, though... that's not saying much.
<WhatPayne> I too want to Command & Conquer
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, but even if the cutscenes are terribad, the visuals are rather impressive
<WhatPayne> BTW RobotPinkie did you play Halo ODST?
<VioletVanilla> 6And WhatPayne~
<RobotPinkie> Not yet, WhatPayne, waiting until I can find it very cheap.
<Dashite> How cheap?
<WhatPayne> I personally liked it more that Halo 3 or Reach.
<RobotPinkie> lol I don't buy games when they're completely new :P
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, $20?
<RobotPinkie> and yeah KZ3 looks absolutely amazing, especially if you consider the 3D, ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, should be $20 at gamestop.
<WhatPayne> Reach was absolute mess... It retconned too much of Halo 1's story
<Dashite> Or Amazon.
<RobotPinkie> I live in Sweden, though... prices don't always drop as quickly here :(
<WhatPayne> Same in Finland RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> wish I could import from the US, but 360 is region locked
<Dashite> Amazon.co.uk?
<WhatPayne> We pay 60€ for new ps3/360 games in stores
<RobotPinkie> Hmmm, that might be worth it even with shipping, Dashite
<RobotPinkie> thanks for the tip
<WhatPayne> That's 82UDS
<Dashite> I think Webhallen has it for around $25ish
<RobotPinkie> the USD is pretty weak right now, though...
<WhatPayne> Yeah.
<WhatPayne> But still, come on.
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow, so they do, Dashite, thanks
<WhatPayne> Luckily PC games are much cheaper.
<Dashite> No problem.
<RobotPinkie> I can drop by there next week, awesome.
<Dashite> Was just trying to remember the places that I've heard Swedish people buying from before. :D
<WhatPayne> And even cheaper when you purchase them avoiding taxes.
<RobotPinkie> lawl, webhallen is where all the gamers go pretty much
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie how many kroners are games in Sweden?
<RobotPinkie> and yeah, PC games are cheaper, but I can't afford a dedicated gaming PC right now :(
<RobotPinkie> 600 or 700, depending on where you buy
<WhatPayne> So about the same as here in euros.
<RobotPinkie> I think 700 is the "recommended" price, but webhallen doesn't care about that :P
<Dashite> Webhallen is showing 500-600 for the new releases.
<WhatPayne> That has taxes included?
<Dashite> Dead Island PC is only 329 apparently.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, exactly, webhallen is awesome. :P
<RobotPinkie> yes, with taxes
<WhatPayne> What's the tax percent in Sweden with games?
<Emp> All you need to do is take a cup of flour, add it to the mix~
<Dashite> More important, they have a 2x4GB DDR3 for 435 apparently. >_>
<RobotPinkie> bought Portal 2 two weeks after release, with orange box, for 449:-
<RobotPinkie> I think it's 30%, WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> and yeah, that's a lot :P
<WhatPayne> Oh it's higher than in Finland
<Dashite> 30%?! :O
<RobotPinkie> might be 25
<Apokalipse> Hello bronystate
<GrimGallop> Ahoy
<WhatPayne> we have "only" ~23%
<RobotPinkie> Ohay Apokalipse
<WhatPayne> Hello
<Apokalipse> Are you guys talking about tax rates? O.o
<RobotPinkie> it's possible that it's 25% here, WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> lol, yes
<WhatPayne> So again about the same.
<RobotPinkie> on games :P
<Apokalipse> fun
*Dashite is quite happy with his 13% sales tax now.
<RobotPinkie> I like the New Jersey sales tax...
<Dashite> Quiet you...
<RobotPinkie> :P
<RobotPinkie> I hate having to figure out how much it is in taxes when I go shopping in the US
<Spyrorocks> Aristeo, I am in conctact with bestbuy canada to buy their customer returned merchandise :)
<WhatPayne> You've shopped in US?
<Charles> how significant is that?
<RobotPinkie> It's like... I see a game for $24.99, and I think I have to pay that amount, but NOPE
<Spyrorocks> very significant.
<Sumica> 7% sales tax here.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I've spent quite some time in the US, WhatPayne
<Spyrorocks> I love cheap stuff to resell.
<RDash> Grr, they just raised our sales tax from 6% to 6.2%
<Dashite> 6.2%? O.o
<WhatPayne> Oh never been in US. They don't add the tax to the price directly like they do here?
<Dashite> Why not just bump it up to 7%?
<RobotPinkie> It's a nice country, as long as you don't turn on Fox News :P
<Flutteryay> Or listen to Ghost
<RDash> Dashite Because we like to make buying this confusing
<Dashite> WhatPayne, nope. Taxes are over and above the list price.
<Flutteryay> Fuck Ghost. Seriously...
<RDash> It's really like 6.24%
<RobotPinkie> ..or countless local radio pundit shows
<RDash> things*
<Dashite> RDash you guys so crazy...
<Flutteryay> Ghost is evil incarnate
<WhatPayne> That's stupid. They have reason for doing that?
<RobotPinkie> and yeah what Dashite said
<RDash> :P
<RobotPinkie> I think it's because sales tax is decided on a state level, WhatPayne
<Charles> ah, so you can specifically ask for their returns? and get Open Box pricing?
<Dashite> ^
<Flutteryay> Eeyup. Correct.
<RDash> WhatPayne Yea, our state thought adding the extra .24% would help balence the budget
<Dashite> Up here in Canada we have both Provincial and Federal sales taxes. Except in Alberta.
<WhatPayne> Ok, I see,
<Dashite> And technically Ontario and parts of the maritimes as well since they have HST now, but that only sorta counts.
<WhatPayne> methinks
<RobotPinkie> HST?
<Dashite> HST = Harmonized Sales Tax
<RobotPinkie> ahhh
<WhatPayne> I'm just trying to wrap my mind over the whole thing with us being one nation, with different tax percents in each state.
<Spyrorocks> no this isnt open box pricing
<Spyrorocks> this is <10% of wholesale cost.
<Dashite> It's basically a combined sales tax so we pay 13% instead of 8% and 5%
<Sumica> sales tax is state tax
<Charles> ah
<WhatPayne> So the same goods shipped from one state to two other states may end up with different taxes...
<RobotPinkie> Spoiler: federal income tax is federal
<Spyrorocks> so for $50k worth of stuff
<Spyrorocks> you pay $5k
<Charles> O_O
<RobotPinkie> "federal" is such a weird word...
<RobotPinkie> It's one of those words that you sometimes stop and think about how it sounds
<Dashite> OH shit! It's the feds! Run for it!
<Charles> so what, you just say "hey, got any returns I could take off your hands?"
<WhatPayne> I'd imagine that people living near state border wanting to shop adjacent state if their taxes are lower.
<RobotPinkie> People do that, yeah. :P
<Sumica> It's common WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> especially when there's a big difference
<Dashite> WhatPayne, we do that in Canada. We go down to the states sometimes for big purchases because they have cheaper prices on lots of big ticket items.
<RobotPinkie> so buying a big screen TV might be worth the trip
<Spyrorocks> it took a whie
<WhatPayne> Oh wow.
<Spyrorocks> i probably talked to 30 people
<Dashite> Exactly.
<Charles> why so many?
<Spyrorocks> before finding the right person who sells the salvage stuff from their warehouse
<Spyrorocks> they dont make it easy :P
<Charles> ah
<Sumica> It gets really common when it's regulated goods like Cigarettes.
<WhatPayne> Wait so states collect taxes themselves? What about the government?
<Dashite> Oh no. For those you go to the reservations.
<Charles> so it wasn't that they did not want to sell, it was that most of them were drones
<RobotPinkie> That
<Sumica> For example in newyork state it's like 12 bucks for a pack.
<Charles> who did not know who you would speak to
<RobotPinkie> that's what federal taxes are for :P
<RobotPinkie> $12 for a pack of smokes? You've got to be shitting me.
<RobotPinkie> That's insane
<AllisZerofuuu> Eyup
*Dashite has no idea what they cost here...
<Sumica> nope, but that state adding extra taxes to reduce people smokeing.
<AllisZerofuuu> It's about 6 and change for one here in Florida
<WhatPayne> Where does government get their tax-income, from different sources, or do the states give a portion of the taxes to government.
<AllisZerofuuu> Up from 3-something from a few years ago
<Dashite> WhatPayne, income tax instead of sales tax
<ValtheJean> the Federal government gets its income from federal taxes
<RobotPinkie> I dunno about what federal taxes there are except income tax, WhatPayne
<Sumica> Vs here in vegas it's 5 somthing a pack, 4 somthing if you go to a reseveration.
<RobotPinkie> but I'm guessing that's a fair bit
<ValtheJean> states receive federal dollars for infrastructure, like highway maintenance
<AllisZerofuuu> Isn't the gas tax federal as well?
<ValtheJean> however, they have to agree to certain restraints
<Spyrorocks> i have no idea
<Spyrorocks> its all just customer returns
<Spyrorocks> people who decided they didnt like the laptop anymore and brought it back within 14 days
<Spyrorocks> stuff like that
*Dermathil waves
<Dashite> Payroll taxes as well.
<Dermathil> GUYS GUYS GUYS
<WhatPayne> But doesn't that taxing system cause discrepancy between states in public services?
<Dashite> Dermathil Dermathil Dermathil
<Dashite> Yes?
<RobotPinkie> Sorry to get off topic, but right when I came back home, I was having such a shit day. Now, I'm feeling pretty good again. :P
<mib_40at5v> why does it say the next stream is in 378 days?
<Dermathil> further proof that that one girl in my class is a nerdchick. She mentioned watching the post-credits sneakpeeks at the end of the marvel movies!!!
<WhatPayne> Why is that RobotPinkie?
<Dermathil> (well I heard her mention them)
<RobotPinkie> Listening to pony music and talking here is nice.
<Dashite> lol Dermathil
<RDash> mib_40at5v I have "Show Time!"
<WhatPayne> Tax talk gets you happier?
<RobotPinkie> Just a lot of stress with studies and work, it's pretty overwhelming
<Dashite> mib_40at5v because it's wrong. And I've only got Show Time! as well.
<RobotPinkie> lol not just tax talk :P
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie, I wish I had that problem.
<AllisZerofuuu> I know RP, ponies also relax me!
<RobotPinkie> also gaming talk and ponies
<AllisZerofuuu> But wow, it's 5 PM and I hardly got to sit down here
<MrChang> no pony is streaming?
<Sumica> Cause that time has been broken for some time Anon
<WhatPayne> Oh yeah gaming talk can be quite nice even with all the differencing opinions
<AllisZerofuuu> Luna was sleepy so I think she went to bed?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I don't mind if people don't like the same games as me.
<Dashite> WhatPayne, yeah you mean all the wrong opinions. IE The ones that are not mine. :p
<RobotPinkie> like I thought Darksiders was awesome
<WhatPayne> YES
<Dermathil> also guys, did you see the spoilery clip on EqD?
<Charles> ah
<RobotPinkie> but ValtheJean thinks it's awful!
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie: Darksiders IS awesome!
<WhatPayne> That's exactly what I mean.
<RobotPinkie> (I don't know that, actually)
<Dashite> Dermathil some people have.
<WhatPayne> Oh dammit. I was supposed to be playing ME1
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dermathil> Valthejean never had the chance to finish watching me playing through Darksiders
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good grief....not this again
<WhatPayne> VioletVanilla, you there?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dermathil> what, Valthejean? Did something happen while I was away?
<Dashite> I think I only got to the dragon thing boss on top of the building before I stopped playing.
*VioletVanilla is here watching Val do this whole thing ;3
<RobotPinkie> I was just joking, ValtheJean. You actually think it's awful? :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oiy...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I never said awful
<WhatPayne> Good. What'll we do with the C&C thing-y?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I just...wasn't...very interested...
<RobotPinkie> lol okay, I wasn't here for that
<RobotPinkie> I have to find a game that Val and I agree is awesome, now...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<RobotPinkie> Yakuza 3?
<Dashite> Vanquish
<VioletVanilla> 6What will we do with it? Payne?
<RobotPinkie> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol...I think I'm just going to stop offering my opinion on things
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dear god, the mudfests it causes
<RobotPinkie> Prince of Persia?
<WhatPayne> I mean has any dates been set about any games?
<RobotPinkie> Haha, I don't think this is a mudfest, ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, you should see how the other ones went :P
<Dermathil> Dashite: the game gets way more awesome after that
<Dermathil> Dashite: such as punching trains in the face of a monster (you push them hard by punching them on the tracks)
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie, I suggest looking in the RTS genre. He likes those more.
<RobotPinkie> What's one of your favorite games, apart from HL2, ValtheJean?
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie: don't worry. It can very easily turn to one with me and Valthejean speaking of games.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Deus Ex
<RobotPinkie> See? That's a game I can get behind
<RobotPinkie> and I hear the sequel is really good
<ValtheJean> 2,14 then you (to some degree) are cultured in my eyes :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also, it's a prequel
<Dermathil> I hear that Deus Ex 2 was shit (invisible wars?)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not a sequel
<ValtheJean> 2,14 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS INVISIBLE WAR
<RobotPinkie> Oh, okay
<VioletVanilla> 6We need to make times for it Payne. .
<Dermathil> and yeah, I heard that the prequel is way better
<ValtheJean> 2,14 IT DOES NOT EXIST
<Dermathil> :3
<RobotPinkie> and there was no such thing as Invisible Wars, seriously...
<Dermathil> trolololo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 WE DO NOT MENTION SUCH BLASPHEMY HERE
<RobotPinkie> LOL
<WhatPayne> Okay VioletVanilla. I'm leaving this to you and Dashite. If you come up with any time/place for game session, just let me know mkay? I still interested.
<prince-dari> Deus Ex, what a crap game.
<Dermathil> LOL DARI
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<RobotPinkie> Perfect comedic timing
*Dermathil never played any deus Ex games but respects them still due to DE:HR being made by Eidos Montreal
<prince-dari> Yeah, I've never played it.
<prince-dari> XP
<Dermathil> French Canadian Dev team FTW
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I don't really know your taste in games dari, but it wouldn't hurt for you to give it a try
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the game is very solid
<prince-dari> My favourite games include Prince of Persia and Spyro.
<prince-dari> Oh, and RDR.
<Dermathil> RDR
<Dermathil> never played
<prince-dari> ^ MFW
<WhatPayne> Right. I'll go be "afk" to play the ME1. Ding me if you need me.
<RobotPinkie> RDR is awesome
<prince-dari> ^
<Dermathil> I know
<Dermathil> just don't even has the hard drive space for it
<prince-dari> So make space.
<Dermathil> only got 10Gb left that are available
<prince-dari> Nao.
<RobotPinkie> that's what consoles are for :P
<Dermathil> on my 451 Gb hard drive
<Dermathil> RP, consoles aren't as precise and don't have as good hardware
*ValtheJean 2,14 has a 2Tb drive for his desktop, you jelly?
<Dermathil> no
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you should be :P
<Dermathil> Since that much space must either run slow or be full of space you'll NEVER use
<Dermathil> If you tell me it is full of stuff, then I be jelly
<RDash> ^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it is :P
<Dermathil> Prove it
<RobotPinkie> Consoles are just as precise, though yeah they might not have the same performance :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what...by copying over all my files?
<Dermathil> screenshot the hard drive icon that shows how much space left there is
<Dermathil> simple!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 one fatal flaw with that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm up at college
*AllisZerofuuu has 3x1TB drives, one 320gb drive and one 110gb SSD
<AllisZerofuuu> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOON
<AllisZerofuuu> Beeeey-tch
<Dermathil> Then I'll be extremely patient with you Valthejean. I'll wait.
<RobotPinkie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIadYS5RpjI
<RobotPinkie> MAN THEM VIDEO GAMES ARE CRAZY!
<Dermathil> also I think there are programs that allow you to control your computer remotely.
<ValtheJean> there are, none of which I've installed on that machine
<RobotPinkie> ...what happened to your color, ValtheJean?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'M TOO BUSY TO ADD COLOR YOU BITCH
<Dermathil> he is going into stealth mode
<Dermathil> shhhh
<RobotPinkie> lawl
*Dermathil presses on Valthejean's lower volume button.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 YOU CANNOT LOWER MY VOLUME
*Dermathil presses on Valthejean's higher volume button.
<Dermathil> Did you say something?
<RobotPinkie> Valthejean's favorite game of all time is Duke Nukem Forever
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol eeyup, you got me pinkie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I just love me some of dat DNF
<RobotPinkie> What? omfg I'm really good at guessing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I loved it so much I threw it into the trash and then burned the pile
<RobotPinkie> I figured it was HL2 or something like that.
<RobotPinkie> DNF was so good that I deleted the demo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you will never know my favorite game :P
<RobotPinkie> Eh, I already know it's Minesweeper
<RobotPinkie> I wrote a Minesweeper clone in PHP... kind of a long time ago. You'd have loved it.
<Turgle> heyall
<RobotPinkie> ohay Turgle
*VioletVanilla has 4TB for her desktop, you TwilightJelly?
<RobotPinkie> I have 250GB, u so very not jelly
<SilverMane> is your favorite game Baldurs gate?
<Dermathil> hey prince-dari, think you could stream some Dr Who? Since you say you sleep earlier I guess streaming earlier would be better?
<Dashite> VioletVanilla, damn you. I only have 1.3TB
<RobotPinkie> I have maybe 5GB of free space
<RobotPinkie> u jelly?
<Dashite> I had 137MB of free space yesterday
<Dashite> On my SSD...
<Dashite> I kinda forgot to move my download folder off C: when I reinstalled...
<RobotPinkie> Damn, now I'm depressed again.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sorry, I've been busy and didn't watch the chat
<ValtheJean> 2,14 was someone asking for me?
<RobotPinkie> I think Silvermane was asking you something.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah, I see
<SilverMane> what?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 in regards to your question: if it was, I wouldn't say because I like the fun of toying with you too much :P
<Dashite> Spoiler: It totally is.
<GrimGallop> That's what I heard
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you're entitled to your opinion :P
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I think that's what it means.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you're free to interpret that as you see fit :P
<RobotPinkie> I think I need an injection of pony, stat
<RobotPinkie> Ahhhhh, much better
<KanyeEast> just wait a few more days and then you'll get all the new ponies that you could ever want (if all you want is a 20 or so minute episode of ponies)
<RobotPinkie> I'll take almost anything I can get right now, except for short clips
<ValtheJean> 2,14 except we're having an entire re-stream of season 1
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so it's more like 10 hours of ponies :P
<RobotPinkie> Wish I could stay up for all of it :(
<GrimGallop> Take this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrlzkKa6O8
<KanyeEast> thats very true, and all the "whose better, fluttershy or rarity" arguments that you can shake a stick at
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DO IT FILLY
<AllisZerofuuu> Gonna go home everypony, see you all in a few.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 jooiiiiiiiinnnnnnn usssssssss
<prince-dari> Clearly the answer would be neither.
<KanyeEast> spoiler: the answer is rarity
<prince-dari> Dash is best pony.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see ya allis
<RobotPinkie> later AllisZerofuuu
<RobotPinkie> You think I should stay up all night for the marathon, ValtheJean?
<Turgle> re-streaming of season 1?
<KanyeEast> sleep is for the weak
<Turgle> when? :3
<KanyeEast> buy like 40 energy drinks
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I do robot :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Turgle: friday night, right after the movies
<RobotPinkie> lol we'll see, maybe if I can get enough sleep in before it starts
<KanyeEast> besides, friday is a very special night to be a brony
<Turgle> yay!
<RobotPinkie> because the christmas in july marathon was awesome.
<KanyeEast> I look forward to celestia potentially kicking ass and taking names.
<KanyeEast> it'll be like yoda vs. the emperor or voldemort vs. dumbledore
<RobotPinkie> Saturday is a very special morning to be a brony
<RobotPinkie> and Val, I can't entirely tell if you're serious when you stick your tongue out :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 le sigh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, I do in all seriousness believe you should stay up with us
<KanyeEast> its a weekend anyway
<RobotPinkie> I was sticking my tongue out, Val, I was kidding!
<KanyeEast> are all the episodes coming out on saturday?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ....
*ValtheJean 2,14 prepares his trident
<RobotPinkie> lawl
<RobotPinkie> All what episodes, KanyeEast?
<KanyeEast> the new ones
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no kanye, it's only the first episode
<RobotPinkie> Naw just one episode of pony
<KanyeEast> I know that, i mean future releases
<RobotPinkie> Oh, lawl
<Sumica> yes there will be much disapoint when 201 ends and there is no 202 till the folloing week.
<RobotPinkie> and that's why I need caffeine
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I don't think that all episodes have been scheduled yet
<Sumica> I am sure all of them have not been planed but we know the first 2 have.
<RobotPinkie> First two episodes are on Saturdays
<RobotPinkie> It seems pretty likely that they'll continue that, I think.
<KanyeEast> I bet we don't even see discord in the first part
<Sumica> If they keep to what they have done already the sunday eps are rerun on monday.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, all I know about Discord is the name
<RobotPinkie> and from the name I can guess what his specialty is
<ValtheJean> 2,14 tea parties, obviously
<Sumica> duh
<Turgle> xD
<RobotPinkie> (Hail Eris, btw)
<Thunder_Dash> So then... Discord plans on ruling Equestria with tea parties?
<RobotPinkie> Well that's how American politics work, I hear.
<Sumica> hey the US was made with a tea party.
<RobotPinkie> not the same kind, though!
<Sumica> have you seen the pics they been posting? looks like raining tea to me.
<RobotPinkie> ...wow, you just blew my mind
<Thunder_Dash> I'm expecting even more Chocolate Rain jokes when the episode airs. :P
<Sumica> lets not forget all the Churro lines from the HUB ads
<RobotPinkie> I'm expecting a Chocolate Rain PMV within hours of the episode airing...
<Sumica> lol
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, probably XD
<Barry> That's ok. When I first saw the pic, I thought it was raining blood
<Sumica> That would require a diffrent song.
<Sumica> not sure if one could poniefy Slayer.
<Barry> Yeah. I guess chocolate rain would be in the style of Trollcord
<Sumica> That the name we gonna use?
<Barry> *shrugs*
<Barry> I just think it fits
<EspyLacopa> Anyone else watching the Brony Show?
<Sumica> you know listening to the song again. It could work for Discord
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SurqXyOjLxE

<MantisToboggan> i live above earth in a big rocket ship
<Ziltoid> Is there something on the stream or is video player busted?
<Ziltoid> The only thing I crave is coffeh
<Sumica> New player was set up but only DCD knows what it is. So we cant stream till we talk to em.
<RobotPinkie> Wow.... I was just invited to watch the Season 2 premiere on a projector
<Ziltoid> You lie
<RobotPinkie> Dead serious.
<RobotPinkie> streamed from the internet, obviously
<Thunder_Dash> Just saw the season 2 clip
<RobotPinkie> oh lol, NOT live, day after
<RobotPinkie> I might go, then.
<RobotPinkie> HD ponies on projected screen with surround sound? I don't think I can say no to that.
<fourze> hi
<Sumica> heya
<Thunder_Dash> Hi
<fourze> im so happy i got this job
<fourze> i get to scare the crap out of people
<fourze> and at this haunted house it has been known to actually happen
<Sumica> Seems a bit early for Haunted houses to be seting up.
<fourze> it wont until late september
<fourze> i had an interview for it
<RobotPinkie> ...crap, I CAN say no to HD ponies on a projected screen in surround sound... it's a complete S1 marathon first, and it ends in the middle of the night...
<fourze> rehearsal starts the 22nd
<Dark_Heart> when will videos play on here again
<Sumica> on a sunday? bleh
<RobotPinkie> Yeah... and school starts early on Monday...
<RobotPinkie> That would have been so awesome :(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 videos play right after the Movie Night movies
<Sumica> I think he ment when will we have a stream again ValtheJean .
<Dark_Heart> ya
<ValtheJean> 2,14 depends on if we get a hold of DCD :P
<AllisZero> Lolcar salesmen
<AllisZero> "I GOT A GREAT DEAL FOR YOU"
<AllisZero> 11% APR on a car
<AllisZero> 'uh... yeah, I actually got 8% somewhere else thanks...'
<Sumica> that's not a deal.
<AllisZero> It's an improvement over the 22% they presented me initially :p
<Sumica> lol.
<RobotPinkie> APR?
<AllisZero> Anual percent rate I think?
<AllisZero> Something like that
<RobotPinkie> Ahh okay
<AllisZero> But yeah it's hard to get a good interest rate when you have no credit history
<RobotPinkie> I've never bought a car in the US.... or anywhere else.
<AllisZero> Rather, a very short one anyway
<AllisZero> This is my first
<AllisZero> Sad, wasn't the car I wanted
<AllisZero> But can't always win
<RobotPinkie> yeah... cars are expensive
<AllisZero> eyup
<Sumica> I just bought mine out right. but then again KIA's are cheep.
<RobotPinkie> I need to save up for a new TV... mine's kinda small
<AllisZero> I wanted to do that, Sumica, but didn't get the chance
<Sumica> Bummer.
<AllisZero> Mom's car bit the dust last week, and 5 people with just a single car isn't an effective way to live
<Sumica> Then again I also went it with out beeing choosy, I just wanted a cheep car for geting around in.
<AllisZero> At least around here where public transportation is piss poor
<Sumica> Got a great deal at an end of the year sell.
<AllisZero> Yeah, it's all about timing sometimes
<AllisZero> http://carchayser.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/02mitslancer2_m_m.jpg -> My dream car
<Sumica> lancers are nice.
<Sumica> Shame they stoped making the 3000gt's
<RobotPinkie> My dream car: http://specialoccasionsdreamponies.com/images/cart.jpg
<AllisZero> Bwahaha
<Sumica> Saw that comeing from the link
<RobotPinkie> Wrong kind of pony though :P
<AllisZero> Hmmm
<AllisZero> I wonder if I should set up my ubuntu box as a SSL VPN server
<AllisZero> All this ponybrowsing at work is making me concerned about my firewall behavior
<Sumica> I am gonna say yes cause I have no idea what that is.
<FreezeFrame> Okay, I watched the clip
<FreezeFrame> I am cursing that I did.
<FreezeFrame> Because now I can wait for Saturday EVEN LESS
<RobotPinkie> If you're worried about people checking your pony habits, then definitely, AllisZero
<FreezeFrame> I really have to see the voice credits for S1E1
<Sumica> Wait you are pony searching at work?
<RobotPinkie> I watch pony vids during downtime at work...
<Sumica> Well I do to but I use my phone
<RobotPinkie> Depends on if someone's around, for me :P
<AllisZero> I am, RP
<AllisZero> For the longest time though I managed to stay at work, then come home and do my personal stuff
<FreezeFrame> I have a pony profile pic on FB in the year I'm adding all the people from my new college
<AllisZero> But with ponies now I'm everywhere haha, I don't want the records to stay around
<AllisZero> Not because it's MLP but it's because it looks like I'm slacking off
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I know what you mean.
<RobotPinkie> and that's pretty baws, FreezeFrame :P
<AllisZero> (I mean I pretty much single-handedly tackle 90+ people with computer issues AND still make about 30% less than people in my position but HEY no slacking)
<RobotPinkie> I think I might do a pony pic on my FB... everyone knows I'm a brony by now anyway.
<Thunder_Dash> I would ponify my FB, but I don't use it anymore
<FreezeFrame> I really don't care who knows that I'm a brony. And if people are going to not want to talk to me because of one small aspect of me, they aren't worth my time.
<RobotPinkie> That's true right thar
<FreezeFrame> I mean, I'm willing to befriend Patriots fans, and that's a heck of a lot worse than being a brony.
<AllisZero> I don't have facebook, and I wouldn't care either way. Never did anyway
<Sumica> Good way to look at it.
<FreezeFrame> Actually, being a Pats fan is, honestly, worse than consorting with Satan.
<FreezeFrame> :D
<RobotPinkie> Though I recognize for some it might be a bit harder, if their friends and family are kinda crazy.
<LordCelestia> Im back from the moon
<Hat> hi is streaming?
<FreezeFrame> anyway, heading right back out
<AllisZero> Crazy as in stupid and intolerant
<Thunder_Dash> I'm still surprised how tolerant my friends and parents have taken it
<Sumica> No stream till we talk to DCD and find out the new location.
<Hat> k
<RobotPinkie> later FreezeFrame
<AllisZero> Hey RP, what do you use to connect to a linux box over the Lan?
<Thunder_Dash> bye, FreezeFrame
<RobotPinkie> Same here, Thunder_Dash... haven't even gotten any snide remarks.
<RobotPinkie> um, SSH? I haven't done any network stuff in a very long time now.
<AllisZero> 'Cause honestly the one thing that threw me off from using Ubuntu more was lack of a reliable VNC client
<AllisZero> Ah, you're one of them command line guys!
<Turgle> linux = command line
<Thunder_Dash> Well, one of my friends didn't take it well, but I'm not really friends with him anymore (he's really rude and I've asked him more than once to stop and he won't, so I kinda gave up)
<RobotPinkie> lol I used to be, anyway. Lately I've been doing everything the easy way
<AllisZero> I'm a linux newbie, not afraid of command lines but right now isn't a good time to learn
<RobotPinkie> That's why I use Ubuntu... it just takes too much time with all the CLI stuff
<Rainbow_Dash> http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1453017/2192205440 Discord is voiced by the same person as Q from star trek
<Thunder_Dash> Oh great, that page linked me to TvTropes and now my entire day is wasted
<RobotPinkie> Ubuntu usually has pretty good documentation though. What do you need in a VNC client?
<RobotPinkie> Vinagre is apparently default, presumably you've already tried that one.
<Sumica> John de Lancie really?
<Pontang> Thunder_Dash: tvtropes is a great place for aspiring writers.
<AllisZero> Just looking to be able to login from the outside, RP. Once inside the ubuntu box I can connect to my other network PCs
<Rainbow_Dash> Yes really Sumica, that comment on Deviantart is official
<AppleBloomWantsHerCutieMark> Ohai
<AppleBloomWantsHerCutieMark> ... so when is the next stream?
<Turgle> the longest nick ever
<Natleyn> Well hello, AppleBloomWantsHerCutieMark

<Thunder_Dash> Pontang; Well, yeah, but I mean... http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tab_explosion.png
<Natleyn> ABWHCM isn't a nice acronym >.>...
<RobotPinkie> Have you checked this list, AllisZero? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Clients
<Sumica> Oh god my borders why must you wrek my borders
<TheLongestLegitNickToEverGrace> This is the longest nick ever
<TheLongestLegitNickToEverGrace> And it wouldnt let me put the whole thing in, so it is also the max number of characters.
<AppleBloomWantsHerCutieMark> When is the next stream?
<Natleyn> Hello, TheLongestLegitNickToEverGrace
<Turgle> oh geez xD
<Natleyn> y u all do dis
<AllisZero> Hmm, I actually think I need a VNC Server to run on the Linux box, RP
<Pontang> I usually go there if I have an idea that I'd like to write out.
<Natleyn> I am not typing that in every time.
<TheLongestLegitNickToEverGrace> Hai Natleyn, Goodbye Natleyn. For I am none other than Rainbow_Dash
<Pontang> Find similar ideas, how it's done, etc.
<RobotPinkie> Well, yeah, that you do.
<Sumica> No set time on next stream besides Fridays stuff, Bound to be somthing sooner but have to talk to DCD to get the new stream information.
<AllisZero> But that gets me started nicely, thank you
<RobotPinkie> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC/Servers
<RobotPinkie> That's the help page for VNC servers. Not sure which one is best.
<AllisZero> Let me pull up my ubuntu box and we'll find out
<AllisZero> I actually really wanted to run ESX server on it, but my processor won't take it and the hours I wasted of my time trying to get it to work were not rewarded
<WhatPayne> Man the ME moves slowly
<RobotPinkie> I might set up my own computer with a VNC server, actually... Might be able to use it for work.
<RobotPinkie> It's a pain using the computers at work, they're literally from the 90's...
<Sumica> so old the casses are yellow I bet.
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah. Yellowish grey.
<RobotPinkie> they were really good at the time, though
<RobotPinkie> ...which doesn't help me at all now
<Sumica> You should see mine it's a gtx from when they first started using gtx
<RobotPinkie> No idea what that is. :P
<Purple`Prose> ...
<Sumica> when they went from the 386 to the P1 chips.
<RobotPinkie> oh lawl
<Sumica> the main board has diffrent hole placments for the screws
<Purple`Prose> Well...this is going to be awesome
<RobotPinkie> what is, Purple`Prose?
<Purple`Prose> I can't wait until Saturday now
<Purple`Prose> Apparently, the new Villian, Discord?
<Natleyn> I'm guessing you watched the clip.
<Sumica> So my current case is old as hell and is like 20lb's empty
<Purple`Prose> Nope
<Natleyn> DANG IT EqD I'M DOING STUFF
<Purple`Prose> Discord is voiced by John de Lancie.
<Purple`Prose> aka Q
<KanyeEast> Q? from star trek?
<Sumica> heh yeah we were just talking about that Purple`Prose
<Sumica> yes that guy KanyeEast
<Purple`Prose> 6_9
<Rainbow_Dash> I told you guys that earlier and I didnt get even the slightest response. >.>
<Purple`Prose> Sorry, I wasn't paying attention
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, I heard
<KanyeEast> what a fitting voice...
<prince-dari> MFW years 9 and 10 in UK school system are colts.
<RobotPinkie> Indeed.
<RobotPinkie> and wat, prince-dari?
<Purple`Prose> I have not, however, watched the clip
<Natleyn> I still don't know who that is >.>
<RobotPinkie> Me neither.
*Natleyn shrugs
<RobotPinkie> You don't know who Q is?
<KanyeEast> oh god, those poor ponies. they don't stand a chance
<KanyeEast> they need pony picard to help them
<Natleyn> I never really got into Star Trek, though I've tried. Picard is awesome, though.
<EspyLacopa> Q vs Ponies?
<RobotPinkie> Well, not everyone is a Trekkie :P
<RobotPinkie> Picard is the baws
<Rainbow_Dash> I have never watched Star Trek either actually. I dont know who he is, I just knew that other people did
<EspyLacopa> Sisko did punch Q in the face though.

<prince-dari> Students in years 9 and 10 in the school system here are colts.
<prince-dari> Though that term probably isn't used in most schools.
*Razyn_Collette 0is a Stallion
<RobotPinkie> How old are you at year 10 of school?
<Razyn_Collette> 0As far as America goes, it's 5/6 + your year in school
<prince-dari> Year 10 you are between 14-15
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay
<Thunder_Dash> So it's roughly the same as it is in Canada/America
<Sumica> Never heard that term used for jr high.
<KanyeEast> we ditch the whole 'grade' thing after highschool starts generally. then we do freshman...etc.
<prince-dari> School system here goes: Primary school
<prince-dari> Years 1-6
<prince-dari> Secondary school
<prince-dari> Years 7-11
<RobotPinkie> You weird Brits
<Sumica> Elementry, Jr high, High school.
<prince-dari> End of compulsary education here.
<prince-dari> At the age of 16.
<Turgle> ^
<prince-dari> Afterwards there's sixth form, which takes place at a secondary school.
<prince-dari> Lower sixth - year 12, upper sixth - year 13.
<prince-dari> Or college, which only deals with years 12-13 unlike a secondary school.

By the time I reached middle school, it was re-adjusted so Primary School was back to K-5, Middle School was 6-8,and Secondary School was the same: 9-12
<Polarfire> Dari, are you gonna be ok for tomorrow?

<prince-dari> (let's see how people interpret this question)
<Natleyn> ^Trollin'
<KanyeEast> we call them cigarettes
<RobotPinkie> o u, prince-dari
*LordCelestia Luna, you know my DA name right?
<Turgle> they see me trollin'
<prince-dari> KanyeEast: That's a fag, not a faggot. :P
<Barry> "AllisZero wishes Luna would leave messages on HIS DA Page" should be "AllisZero wishes Luna would leave messages on HER DA page"
<LordCelestia> a faggot is a bundle of sticks
<KanyeEast> wouldn't it be the plural?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Fag is just slang.
<AllisZero> I'm not a girl Barry
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<KanyeEast> ah right, fags would be plural
<E_N> http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/173189-tourist-guy

<RobotPinkie> I'm going out to smoke a faggot
<Natleyn> :<
<AllisZero> I'm saying I'd like for her to leave message on my page
<KanyeEast> you have silly names for things, like bender
<prince-dari> A faggot is a meatball.
<prince-dari> :P
<Barry> sorry, I thought you meantLune leaving...nevermind
<KanyeEast> that must make futurama interesting.
<RobotPinkie> Sounds like I'm going to go kill someone
<LordCelestia> whats a wanker
<LordCelestia> lol jk
<AllisZero> Lol it does RP!
<KanyeEast> dari do you like doctor who?
<Natleyn> Robot: xD

<prince-dari> Tennant is my favourite.
<KanyeEast> ^ me too
<E_N> Surprise surprise
<KanyeEast> though I like what Matt Smith has been doing
<KanyeEast> maybe its because of moffat
<Barry> Sorry. When I see a question that I know the answer to, I'm compelled to answer
<RobotPinkie> Tennant is my favorite meatball
<Fluttershy> What the?
<E_N> Matt Smith is my favorite cig
<Fluttershy> >> my random time to come back in
<Fluttershy> I didn't know people could be meatballs.
<prince-dari> MFW all the British meanings that words don't have in America are all about sex.
*Natleyn hugs Fluttershy
<prince-dari> Well, quite a lot anyway.
<Natleyn> Well hello.
<KanyeEast> I can't help but giggle when I hear british slang
<Fluttershy> prince-dari: makes me think of the word 'wank' ... )
<KanyeEast> like 'bloody' and 'wanker'
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, prince-dari, like the word "bollocks"
<prince-dari> Like gagging.
<RobotPinkie> It's perfectly fine to say in the UK
*Fluttershy is hugged, smiles. ^^ Hi
<KanyeEast> or 'tosser'
<RobotPinkie> hay flutter
<prince-dari> "She was gagging for it"
<Barry> That would make no sense with the American definition of gagging
<RobotPinkie> You naughty Brit
<prince-dari> Wait, a gangbang in America is rape?
<Luna> 07Allis
<Sumica> Yes this conversation would get strange looks in the US?
<KanyeEast> yeah
<prince-dari> O_o
<E_N> Not nessecarily
<KanyeEast> well, sort of a kind of rape
<KanyeEast> but it could mean like a mob of people
<prince-dari> Here it just means orgy.
<Barry> I'm from America and I'm not giving it a strange look
<AllisZero> Yes Luna?
<KanyeEast> I guess it means the same sort of thing
<Sumica> Cause you have context Barry.
<Barry> hm
<KanyeEast> i'm given to understand that 'bender' means the same thing as 'buttsex' is that true?
<RobotPinkie> Orgies aren't sexual?
<RobotPinkie> Now I'm confused.
<Turgle> yes they are
<KanyeEast> if so, how do you watch futurama?
<Sumica> You know what they are talking about. Think about what you would be thinking if you did't know they were refering to slag.
<prince-dari> Where'd I say orgies aren't sexual?
<prince-dari> O_o
<Turgle> at least here they are
<Anonymous> I make....................
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> KanyeEast: Bender just means gay.
<Anonymous> a lot of...
<Barry> In my book, rape is simply the unconsentual touching of another's genitalia.
<Anonymous> Music.
<prince-dari> "He looks like a bender"
<RobotPinkie> <prince-dari>: MFW all the British meanings that words don't have in America are all about sex.
<prince-dari> [00:23] <prince-dari> Well, quite a lot anyway.
<RobotPinkie> I was making a bad joke.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Ziltoid> >comes back in chat see talk of orgies
<Ziltoid> wut
<prince-dari> XD
<Turgle> :D
<Thunder_Dash> What Ziltoid said. XD
<Barry> Which is why I have the idea,when dealing with partial or full nudity, look but don't touch unless given consent
<Natleyn> Hiya Ziltoid
<KanyeEast> and don't accept candy from strangers
<Barry> That is a co0mpletely different philosophy
<AllisZero> WOHOO

<GrimGallop> For ages, the rose has been given as a gift as a traditional sign of love. However, the rose withers within a matter of days. To some, this is interpreted as something along the lines of, "You're beautiful like this rose is now, but eventually you'll wither away and will be of no more use to me."
<GrimGallop> The potato, on the other hand, only continues to grow, even if picked and left in a bag.
<TwilightSparkle> My mod app it got denied :(
<Thunder_Dash> GrimGallop; So... give people potatoes instead of roses?
<MrChang> because you're never on
<GrimGallop> In addition, rather than existing only for appearances, it can be enjoyed in countless ways. Mashed, baked, fried, cut into chips, made into soup, etc. A potato says, "I love you in a countless number of undying ways!"
<GrimGallop> And that is what the potato means ^_^
<MrChang> you're forgetting french fries

<TrollightSparkle> Hmm.. I'm playing stuff too :P
<Natleyn> I'm working on the second hardest cursor in Twilight's set.
<Natleyn> ... friggin' tranparency...
<TrollightSparkle> Creating cursors?
<herospirit> :[
<Natleyn> Yep.
<TrollightSparkle> Sounds pretty awesome!
<DecapKing> http://totallylookslike.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/michele-bachmann-totally-looks-like-marilyn-manson.jpg
<Natleyn> hero: Luna, Rarity and Twilight's alt link select cursors are gonna be pretty similar. Twi's probably have less sparkles.
<Sumica> Eh, make sure ytou let us see it.
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah, cause I think I'd like some cursors to go with my wallpaper and such :P
<Natleyn> Yeah, yeah. It's gonna take forever to just get the mane 6 done. -le sigh-
<Natleyn> At least I like working on them.
<TrollightSparkle> Take your time, I'm sure you're doing fine.
<Natleyn> There's no rush. xD
<Natleyn> I finish homework EARLY in anticipation of making these.
<Tenure> I hate homework
<Natleyn> If they don't hold up to my version of perfectionism, out the door and start over
<herospirit> Yar. Don't overwork yourself or you'll get bored of it :0
<TrollightSparkle> Homework.. *shudders*
<Natleyn> It's why I have 4 versions of Luna's loading cursor.
<Tenure> friggin statistics is KILLING me here.
<Natleyn> I think I just have review from a book I don't have, but I'll have access to it when I get to my college's library.
<herospirit> I have no math class this year >: D
<TrollightSparkle> You think that's bad.. I'll be taking 2 math classes next month..
<TrollightSparkle> But I enjoy math, so it'll be fine.
<Tenure> I now have to figure out an accident that has a 1 in 4 million probability translates to an estimated lifetime of fifty thousand...

<herospirit> :0
<herospirit> You can do it
<herospirit> I believe in you
<TrollightSparkle> I'm thinking of going in on the first day of class with an FiM shirt :P
<herospirit> Lol. You in college?
<TrollightSparkle> Will be in October :)
<herospirit> College students seem to be less stupidly hostile to things.
<KanyeEast> what major are you looking at?
<TrollightSparkle> I guess so, and software development/programming/computer stuff.
<Natleyn> Same as me.
<TrollightSparkle> @herospirit, I guess I'll see on the first day of class :o
*Natleyn brohoofs TrollightSparkle
<KanyeEast> awesome, computers will never stop being important
<herospirit> Haha :P
*TrollightSparkle brohoofs Natleyn back. COMPUTER NERDS FTW
<KanyeEast> I am consigned to write endless papers, such is the life of a history major
<Sumica> nope but you will have to retrain on them every year forthe rest of your working life.
<Pontang> KanyeEast: history major eh?
<herospirit> My older sister has told me that college students tend to be better than highschool ones were.
<TrollightSparkle> History's interesting, I liked history :)
*Natleyn hugs KanyeEast
<Pontang> Sounds fun
<KanyeEast> Yes, i am the biggest history nerd ever
<Pontang> I love history and stories.
<Pontang> :p
<herospirit> I'm going to be going into art. :0
<Kencolt> Ah... no stream... oh, well...
<TrollightSparkle> History is nice, I'm just not too terribly interested in it.
<Natleyn> T^T
<Natleyn> Hero, I messed up so much with the Luna link select cursor ;~;
<Pontang> KanyeEast: favorite part of history?
<Natleyn> You can't friggin tell 'cause it all blends anyway...
<Pontang> :o
<KanyeEast> My favorite part tends to be the stuff i'm learning about
*Natleyn hides in a dark corner and sniffs sadly, still working
<herospirit> You did, Nat? :0
<herospirit> It seems fine to me :0
<Pontang> Well, I meant, what time period/region?
*TrollightSparkle hugs Natleyn
<Kencolt> hmm...
<KanyeEast> I know a lot about the american civil war. And chinese history from about 1700-now
<TrollightSparkle> Oh hai Kencolt
<Natleyn> Two frames! Two! Where all the transparency is broken and stupid 'cause I forgot to advance a step downwards...
<Pontang> I hate American history. x_x
<Kencolt> New site, I see...
<KanyeEast> a lot of its really boring, we didn't have the decency to get invaded after 1812
<Natleyn> Ugh. Moping is no way to act.
<Natleyn> FIXIN' TIME
<herospirit> Oh. I'm using the alternate link select, so I guess I wouldn't know :0
<Pontang> I do love the early 20th century.
<herospirit> I really like the alt one.
<Pontang> I'm somewhat into the steampunk stuff.
<KanyeEast> I'm also a big fan of sociology and the 'why' behind decision making
<Sumica> yeah trying to get everything ready for saterday
<KanyeEast> international diplomacy and the like, if you ever want to be an optimist about people thats where you look
<Natleyn> Alt one is now standard, 'cause it's coolest
<KanyeEast> even the craziest dictators like kim jong il are actually rational in their decision making.
<LordCelestia> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
*LordCelestia lands back to Earth and hits the ground face first
<Natleyn> I'll be releasing an updated Luna after I fix it all >.>...
<Natleyn> Welcome back, my LordCelestia.
<Pontang> I'm big on the antiquity Europe/pre-medieval ages.
*GrimGallop appears
<LordCelestia> Damn it my cannon didnt send me away. it sent me in a giant circle around the sun and back here
<herospirit> ..............
<KanyeEast> thats gravity for you
<Kencolt> And that is why the operable alicorns are ususally girls. Your face hurt much?
<Pontang> Greek/Rome/Byzantine is my favorite.
<TrollightSparkle> Well.. sucks to be you!
<KanyeEast> The romans are/were awesome
<TrollightSparkle> Now launch me away from this planet LordCelestia!
<LordCelestia> my face! god dammit
<LordCelestia> where do u want to go?
<TrollightSparkle> No idea, anywhere.
<Pontang> The Romans were pretty savage though.
<herospirit> So I'm still making these Pony portrait sprites.......
<herospirit> And I just realized
<KanyeEast> you think so?
<LordCelestia> you don't have any idea? i know where you can find out
<LordCelestia> ON THE MOOOOOOOOON
<KanyeEast> I mean, to the germanic tribes yeah
*LordCelestia launches TwilightSparkle to moon
<KanyeEast> the whole "food for children" program wasn't very nice
<herospirit> How INTENTLY I'm staring at this Pony ass to figure out the shading ;_;
<Natleyn> Whatcha realize, hero?
<Natleyn> ;~;
<herospirit> ;_;
<GrimGallop> o.o
<herospirit> The best part is
<Kencolt> That's wierd even to a wolf.
<Natleyn> Hero, my 'messups' were where I misplaced a 96/255 transparent pixel instead of a 80/255 transparent pixel.
<herospirit> I'm listening to "Hot Patootie" from RHPS
<Natleyn> Well, a lot of pixels.
<herospirit> Ah, gotcha Natleyn
<KanyeEast> sounds like you really liked RHPS for the songs to be stuck in your head after so many days
<GrimGallop> Brb again, time to run to the store :D
<Natleyn> Seeya in a bit, Grim!
<herospirit> So, when I realized I was staring at Pony ass, Eddy suddenly shouted "HOOOOOOOOT PATOOOOOTIE"
<herospirit> ;_;
<Kencolt> I do not think I wish to meet Eddie.
<herospirit> just like "whatever floats your boat Eddy".
<Kencolt> Or Eddy.
<Kencolt> Or Ed.
<herospirit> Eddy from, RHPS.
<herospirit> What about Double D, Kencolt?
<Kencolt> And RHPS would be...
<Natleyn> Eugh.
<Natleyn> Maybe I'll finish this by midnight, maybe not...
<herospirit> Rocky Horror Picture Show
<Natleyn> One cursor being five hours of work isn't fun...
<Kencolt> Oh, THAT-- ERRGH.
<herospirit> You tired, Kencolt? :p
<herospirit> Brains like to not work at night.
<Kencolt> No... injured- injured my foot about a wekk ago and still in discomfort.
<Sumica> Solar powerd mind?
<herospirit> ...Which is awesome, because if you are tired enough, EVERYTHING is funny.
<Natleyn> Hiya DCD

<Kencolt> Not a lot ofm actual pain at the moment, but a lot of milds aching.
<Sumica> He lives
<Natleyn> To be shown how much of a brony he was.
<herospirit> Me and my friend once had a conversation about a flaming Unicorn shitting rainbows falling from the sky, and we were tired enough that we found it hilarious.

<NewDCD> is dari around?
<LordCelestia> nope
<Kencolt> Greetings, DCD.

<TreyLove> :O
<Tenure> oh ye gods
<herospirit> Silvermane writes them.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Yes, Treylove.
<TreyLove> I'm just getting a statistical analysis for a college paper
<TrollightSparkle> ..I read one once.. and it ruined part of my perceptions of some ponies.
<Tenure> that reminds me of when a friend of mine asked me to do a dramatic reading of a clopfic
<herospirit> Silvermane is the master of writing them.
<TreyLove> Because I have some that a friend of mine asked me to do...starring him
<TreyLove> I'm prud of those two, actually
<herospirit> Lol :p
<TreyLove> So, for science, Anypony wishing to help me with my experiment, say I
*Fluttershy pulls SilverMane tightly into her arms, growling.
<Tenure> I wouldn't have minded but the fic he chose was nothing short of horrific
<SilverMane> Herospirit... wow, thanks for the praise, but... i actually don't. I simply RP clop-scenes well.
*SilverMane squeaks at the sudden embrace
<NewDCD> wait
<Tenure> but I read it anyway
<TreyLove> the worst clopfic I ever read was cupcakes
<NewDCD> Fluttershy
<herospirit> But you're writing the... thing
<herospirit> that thing thing
<Natleyn> Trey... what
<NewDCD> since when do you have arms and not hooves?
<Tenure> rutting day was worse
<herospirit> with the stuff
<Tenure> way worse
<Natleyn> Yous trollin
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0TreyLove, go sit in the corner and think of what you did
<Fluttershy> /what/ NewDCD?
<NewDCD> also, guys
<TreyLove> I didn't even get there with cupcakes
<TreyLove> I'm all for BDSM but that was too intense
<Natleyn> 'sup DCD?
<TreyLove> It's almost like Rainbow died
<Dashite> NewDCD, hooves don't replace arms, they replace hands. :p
<NewDCD> >Fluttershy pulls Silvermane into her ARMS...
<herospirit> LOL. You're going to fit in fine here Trey.
<Natleyn> Trey, now's a good time to stop.
<NewDCD> well she probably meant forelegs

<herospirit> Silvermane, you should all Trey into that place
<herospirit> Tat one place
<herospirit> That I avoid for my sanity's sake
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Aw... I was hoping for gattaida
<TreyLove> not a big transformers fan
<herospirit> :0
<SilverMane> Herospirit, you mean... the forbidden room?
<herospirit> Wat.
<Natleyn> Gahhh.
<TreyLove> lol I'm actually streaming my music livbrary to a friend
<herospirit> Yes Silvermane
<TreyLove> lol I'm actually streaming my music library to a friend
<NewDCD> But Trey those are Gundams
*herospirit slaps Trey
<herospirit> THAT IS NOT TRANSFORMERS
<TreyLove> He doesn't have any remixes so I skype called him and am playing music
<SilverMane> Herospirit... not today, but we'll see. keep an eye on him for me
<TreyLove> well I guess you know what I don't really watch either
<TreyLove> Gundam
<TreyLove> :/
<TreyLove> yeah.
<herospirit> :P
<TreyLove> More of a Coawboy Bebop kind of guy
<TreyLove> ergo proxy
<TreyLove> inuyasha
<TreyLove> albeit the previous being my first anime
<Tenure> The only gundam series I've ever liked was G Gundam
<NewDCD> Trey Gundam and Bebop are both by Sunrise
<TreyLove> the only "longer" anime I like
<Natleyn> Posting to keep track of conversation.
<TreyLove> well I guess I have to pick one poison
<NewDCD> Tenure: go watch Gundam X, it's good too
<Tenure> if only because it never took itself too seriously
<TreyLove> Bebop it is
<TreyLove> Besides, I'm writing a bebop crossover, so
<NewDCD> Are you the one writing Pony Symphony, Trey?
<TreyLove> and a LOZ crossover
<TreyLove> as much as I would love to...know
<TreyLove> And I'm not the one writing "when Trey came to town" either
<TreyLove> *no
<herospirit> You know one of the animes I watch? Bobobo-bo-bo-bobo
<herospirit> It is like drugs.
<Natleyn> Gah.
<herospirit> It makes no fucking sense.
<NewDCD> >Flutteryay
<TreyLove> I swear the writer of Trey in town stole my idea
<KanyeEast> I love one piece
<Natleyn> I forgot that on purpose.
<NewDCD> Flutteryay vs. Fluttershy
<TrollightSparkle> Bobobo was hilarious
<herospirit> I love Bobobo :3
<NewDCD> Heaven or Hell
<NewDCD> let's rock
<Natleyn> @lovemeter Fluttershy Flutteryay
<Steven_Magnet> 13 Fluttershy and Flutteryay are 53% in love.
<TreyLove> I go by "Bandmaster" Trey, so symphony would be my bag, i guess
<Natleyn> Good enough.
<TrollightSparkle> How are you doing that..
<herospirit> I knew I was insane when I started being able to predict Bobobo.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0:0
<KanyeEast> you can predict bobobo?
<herospirit> I've done it before.
<KanyeEast> i've rewatched epsidoes and lost track of what was happening
<herospirit> Someone was dancing and I was like "AND NOW COWS FALL FROM THE SKY"
<herospirit> ...and then cows fell from the sky.
<herospirit> :0
<KanyeEast> you have the gift
<herospirit> :3
<Natleyn> :3
<Tenure> I really wanted to do a Persona crossover but there's so many doing it now I feel I've been beaten to it.
*Natleyn brohoofs Herospirit
*herospirit brohoofs Nat
<Tenure> So I might just do a grimdark Drakengard crossover instead
<Natleyn> 3 frames left till I'm done with Twilight's Link Select (the alt one for luna) is done.
<KanyeEast> Why not cross mlp with more hasbro franchises?
<Tenure> DRAKENDASH
<KanyeEast> like gi joe and transformers?
<Natleyn> But then I have to check all the friggin' transparencies, and fix Luna's.
<NewDCD> also guys
<herospirit> Lol. Pony Joe
<Tenure> because crazy japanese stuff is more fun to crossover with.
<herospirit> My Little G.I.s
<KanyeEast> twilight's friendship report
<KanyeEast> and then "And knowing is half the battle"
<Natleyn> 'sup DCD?
<herospirit> XD
<NewDCD> I'm thinking about streaming this whole series post-premiere since it's only three episodes long, and one hell of a KER-AZY PAHTEE

<Natleyn> Looks cool enough
<Natleyn> Length of each episode?
<TreyLove> anypony on fimfiction?
<NewDCD> Don't remember, but not too long
<Natleyn> Alrighty-o. I approve
<KanyeEast> pony reach?
<herospirit> Notjust Pony Reach
<herospirit> Dead Gears of Pony Reach Space
<herospirit> :0
<KanyeEast> all you need is commander shepard
<herospirit> Yeeeeeeeesssss
<KanyeEast> twilight already is basically tali
<KanyeEast> just give her a shotgun
<herospirit> I like Twilight weilding a piece of Necromorph there
<herospirit> Also, the person who made the comic made a version of the last panel with a transparent background
<NewDCD> does anybody here know Gundam 00?
<herospirit> so you can use it as a desktop :p
<herospirit> I'm not very Gundam savvy DCD
<Natleyn> Meow.
<KanyeEast> which gundam was that? the old school one with the flying ship?
<NewDCD> Because SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
<TreyLove> hero, I'm the worst gundum savvy pony here
<TreyLove> I thought the pic was transformers
<herospirit> XD
<KanyeEast> all I remember is the really gay gundam on toonami
<KanyeEast> gundam wing
<TrollightSparkle> No, I AM. I have never seen Gundam. Ever.
<NewDCD> naw 00 is the most recent
<NewDCD> Till Gundam AGE starts in October that is
<Natleyn> ...
<TreyLove> Neither have I
<TreyLove> I never watched gundam
<Natleyn> Going to kill myself with this transparency stuff.
<TreyLove> and when I do, I think it's transformers
<KanyeEast> for shows about giant robots I prefered Big O
<herospirit> Kanye, speaking of Pony/Mass Effect
<NewDCD> aka: MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM LAYTON AND THE CURIOUS AGE
<KanyeEast> batman + giant robot = amazing
<herospirit> http://th07.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2011/199/3/0/friendship_is_universal_2_by_mixermike622-d40ok1f.png
<NewDCD> Kayne: we watch Big O on Saturdays in the Stream
<KanyeEast> :O
<TreyLove> brb
<TrollightSparkle> Lol hero
<TreyLove> well hell this is gonna be tabbed for a week
<herospirit> Brushy btushy
<herospirit> brushy*
<TreyLove> might as well be tabbed for the entire season
<TreyLove> i'l just say afk
<Natleyn> Dat comic
<herospirit> Lol
<TreyLove> AFK
<KanyeEast> even wrex can't resist the adorable that is fluttershy
<TreyLove> t/afk
<NewDCD> Actually it's like this:
<NewDCD> Gundam X > Eureka 7 > Gravion > Big O > Megas XLR
<TreyLove> is there and afk command?
<TreyLove> oh. red name
<TreyLove> yep
<TrollightSparkle> slash away I think?
<herospirit> Wrex/Fluttershy = BFF
<TreyLove> hm
<TreyLove> whatever
<TreyLove> just trust me that I'm away
<TreyLove> I know I'm new but just trust me.
<NewDCD> @OTPmeter Wrextershy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Wrextershy is 98% OTP. (79)
<TreyLove> I don't want to leave you any more than I have to.
<NewDCD> OH GOD
<TrollightSparkle> Mmk.
<Natleyn> WHOA.
<herospirit> what does OTP stand for?
<Natleyn> When did chat change? o-o
<herospirit> ._.
<KanyeEast> its a shame japan didn't like Big O, i guess it was too deep for them
<Natleyn> One true pairing
<KanyeEast> one true pairing
<herospirit> I'm Saving that
<Hat> what's happening!?! i just got here!
<KanyeEast> or it didn't have enough magical girls with bright blue hair who were kawaii
<Natleyn> For me: Scratch and 'Tavi, Lyra/Bonbon, ect
<Natleyn> But seriously, when did chat go to white
<NewDCD> Kanye: actually Japan likes Big O as well, if SRW is any indication
<NewDCD> Paradigm City plays a VERY big role in SRW Z, not to mention the game actually explains what Paradigm City IS
<NewDCD> too bad those SRW games are Japanese only
<KanyeEast> so why didn't they make a third season?
<Natleyn> Wait, what
<Natleyn> DCD what is SRW
<NewDCD> I stream SRW Z2 and sortie with Roger all day erry day : 3
<KanyeEast> I want to know whats the deal with those tomatos man
<KanyeEast> tomatoes
<Natleyn> Leave for literally half a minute and miss important stuff.
<NewDCD> Super Robot Wars
<NewDCD> Mecha crossover SRPG I stream A LOT
<Natleyn> Oh.
<NewDCD> You got characters from Gurren Lagann together with Gundams and Mazinger and Getter and Variable Fighters and Big O and Gravion and Orguss and GodMars and...
<NewDCD> needless to say
<KanyeEast> robots, robots everywhere
<NewDCD> it is every mecha fanboy's wet dream
<NewDCD> and the plots are actually GOOD. Too bad they are in Japanese
<NewDCD> still the battle animations are amazing and I know how to play it. It's fun
<Natleyn> Hey hero
<KanyeEast> you'd think TTGL would just sweep everything.
<KanyeEast> they power their robots with hotbloodedness
<Natleyn> Before you sleep, would you like to see Twi's link select cursor?
<Sumica> yes Natleyn
<Natleyn> One frame left, and I'm not changing design atm.
<Natleyn> Sumica and herospirit, you two are being my beta testers >_>
<Sumica> oro?
<Natleyn> I'll PM you when I finish the frame
<herospirit> Huh? Sorry? I just got here ;_;
<Natleyn> look up, it's not that far
<NewDCD> also Kanye: Paradigm was built as a method of forgetting the Black History (from Turn A Gundam), which would eventually destroy mankind
<NewDCD> Ever played Persona 3 and remember the option you have to decide to wipe your memories so you can live without the knowledge that the world will end in a few months? Sort of like that.
<herospirit> Oh, sure, I'll see it :D
<KanyeEast> huh, I figured people were forgetting on purpose. what with the giant ruins under the water you see for like 3 seconds on the last episode.
<Natleyn> Hero, check 'yer PM.
<KanyeEast> with the trailer that got released it looks like people are already hard at work coming up with fanfics and what not.
<NewDCD> Kayne keep in mind that SRW exists in a multiverse. That's the explanation we get from the Z-Verse, but the Big O Canon-verse and D-verse might be different (yes, the canon settings of these shows exist in the SRW Multiverse, just that the SRW Game Verses have them characters all existing in the same worlds; as in born there, not Secret Wars crossoverlike)
<NewDCD> you'd have better luck asking Kaworu Nagisa from Evangelion
<KanyeEast> well i'll just learn Japanese then. Fly to japan and break into the creator of Big O's house.
<NewDCD> he's heavily implied to be a Time Diver (read: multiverse world-hopper who keeps the balance of causality)
<NewDCD> He has experienced the events of the SRW games with Eva (F/F Final, Alpha/Alpha 3 and MX), remembers the events from said universes, has experienced the anime's canon universe as well, and Rebuild MIGHT be hinting to this Kaworu being TimeDiver!Kaworu
<NewDCD> SRW: Serious Business
<herospirit> Saved for future posterity: http://i920.photobucket.com/albums/ad43/herospirit/Wrextershy.png
<KanyeEast> wait, Kaworu is a time lord?
<Beefchief> What would happen is Endless 8 (from Haruhi Season 2) happened to My Little Pony Friendship is Magic season 2?
<Natleyn> I don't remember saying whoa.
<Natleyn> DANG IT I MISSED SOMETHING
<Zephirdd> Beefchief: care to elaborate?
<Zephirdd> I havent seens haruhi at all
<KanyeEast> he means if they did a constant loop of the same episode, just animated different
<KanyeEast> same content, over and over.
<TrollightSparkle> Quick question, what's OTP?
<KanyeEast> one true pairing
<KanyeEast> its a shipping term
<Zephirdd> lol
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, ok
<KanyeEast> to describe who someone think is the 'perfect' couple
<Zephirdd> isnt that kinda normal for a way to fill time in jap anime?
<KanyeEast> so twilight/books
<Zephirdd> Gintama had a couple episodes like that
<KanyeEast> not quite, haruhi had literally the same content
<KanyeEast> for 8 episodes
<NewDCD> Kanye: someeeeething like that
<NewDCD> Think less Time Lord and more Dimensional Lord, at least according to SRW, which introduced the concept
<NewDCD> The only confirmed Time Divers are Ingram Prisken and his successor Cobray Gordon... But Kaworu is HEAVILY implied to be a Time Diver as well
<Zephirdd> oh
<herospirit> It was a time loop
<Pontang> Oh God, that was horrible.
<Zephirdd> I thought it was some sort of repeating the scenes on the same episode
<Pontang> I was stupid enough to watch all 8 episodes.
<Zephirdd> not repeating episodes
<Zephirdd> now that'd be weird
<KanyeEast> nah, literally 8 episodes animated in different ways.
<KanyeEast> and with slightly different scenes
<KanyeEast> spike could be like "twilight denwa"
<NewDCD> and since Hideaki Anno himself has penned most of SRW's Evangelion scenarios and events, this probably extends to canon as well
<Beefchief> apple bloom would be 'kyon's sister'
<Beefchief> applejack denwaaa
<KanyeEast> so whose haruhi? twilight?
<NewDCD> Pinkie
<KanyeEast> ah, makes sense
<Beefchief> haruhi suzumiya is basically japanese pinkie pie except is also a god
<Natleyn> ^This
<Zephirdd> silly Beefchief, who said pinkie isnt a god?
<KanyeEast> Fluttershy is also obviously Mikuru
<NewDCD> I got bored of Haruhi just before Endless Eight began its bullshit
<KanyeEast> I just read the translated light novels, they were pretty good
<Zephirdd> lol, the only thing I know about Haruhi
<Beefchief> If pinkie was a god, closed space would have enveloped equestria in Party of One and the world would've been reborn
<Zephirdd> is the music "God Knows"
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Haruhi is fine but overrated
<Zephirdd> which has a fucking awesome guitar solo
<Zephirdd> and thats it
<NewDCD> that series needed 20% more Tsuruya
<Zephirdd> Counfound these ponies
<Zephirdd> they drive me to listen to Avenue Q
<KanyeEast> they drive me to crossover?
<NewDCD> also
<NewDCD> WMG Time
<KanyeEast> yay, I love guessing
<NewDCD> FiM belongs to the SRW OG-verse
<KanyeEast> because it has giant robots?
<NewDCD> Because Big Macintosh and Kyosuke Nanbu are basically the same person
<NewDCD> Same with Pinkie Pie and Excellen
<NewDCD> Ergo it is one of the many OG-verses
<KanyeEast> my guess is that "Progress's" interpretation of Luna will be the closest
<NewDCD> hell you could call Kyosuke's Alteisen "Big Mechintosh" and it'd be pretty close
<NewDCD> also you guys
<NewDCD> SRW Z-series gave us this attack animation gem
<NewDCD> TO DA MOOOOONAAAAAH http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgvQgHIbF-U

<Zephirdd> lol
<KanyeEast> oh its like final fantasy?
<NewDCD> it's an SRPG
<NewDCD> Think Fire Emblem with Giant Fighty Robots
<herospirit> .....
<NewDCD> I also find it funny that the mech is called SOLAR Aquarion
<NewDCD> Clearly Celestia has had a hand on this
<herospirit> >Fire Emblem with Giant Fighty Robots
<herospirit> WHY HAVEN'T I PLAYED THIS YET
<NewDCD> it's her moon banishment platform
<herospirit> what is it for?
<herospirit> Like, playstation or what?
<NewDCD> herospirit: go play SRW J
<NewDCD> It's for the GBA and there's a fan translation lying around
<NewDCD> It's a great starting point (Alpha Gaiden is also translated but it's much more difficult....J is great for learning the SRW System so you can play the Japanese games like I do)
<NewDCD> there are like 40 SRW games
<NewDCD> so yeah
<herospirit> O_O
<herospirit> I.... don't know if I want to start that kind of undertaking O-O
<NewDCD> it's a 20-year-old series this year
<NewDCD> And inmensely popular
<NewDCD> relax herospirit
<Natleyn2> Its almost like deciding to 100% every Disgaea x.x
<NewDCD> they aren't sequels
<NewDCD> they all stand in their own continuity, or belong to a short series
<herospirit> Cool, I'll try'em out
<herospirit> But for now, I sleep
<NewDCD> for example, all of the handheld games (barring Z2) are standalone
<NewDCD> the main series are as such:
<Natleyn2> Nighty night, Herospirit
<Natleyn2> My little tester. <3
<FreezeFrame> Time to sleep.
<herospirit> :3
*Natleyn2 hugs herospirit and FreezeFrame goodnight
<NewDCD> Classic: 2-3-EX-F- F Final + Masoukishin Gaiden
<Natleyn2> I'm also leaving, so....
<Natleyn2> Night everypony! :3
<herospirit> May your dreams be filled with Pony!
<TrollightSparkle> Night Natleyn!
<NewDCD> Alpha: Alpha, Alpha Gaiden, Alpha 2, Alpha 3
<NewDCD> Z Series: Z, Z2 -Hakai-hen, Z2 - Saisei-hen (to be released), Z3 (announced for PSVita)
<NewDCD> Original Generation: OG1 and OG2 GBA, remade into OGS for PS2, OGS Gaiden, and OGS2 for PS3 due next month
<NewDCD> the rest of the games are all stand-alone
<Sumica> Oh my who got DCD started on SRW
<TrollightSparkle> Not me >.>
<Stomper> hey

<Dashite> What are you using?
<Sumica> xchat, I can chage it but it's only my end.
<Colgate> hihello
<Polarfire> What's the problem, Sumica?
<Polarfire> I use xchat too
<Dashite> 7Sumica is trying to do this in xchat
<TrollightSparkle> Good night to you all.
<Stomper> where awesomeshy at?
<Stomper> he been on today?
<Polarfire> Right click, the text bar, Insert Attribute or color code
<Polarfire> 13 leik thees
<Dashite> inb4 we get kicked while trying to demonstrate
<Polarfire> lolyup.
<Polarfire> >_>
<Dashite> It was weird seeing that "This is your first warning" message.
<Dashite> It's been so long...
<Sumica> the warnings get reset every time Dari gets dc'ed
<Polarfire> XD
<Polarfire> and eeyup.
<Dashite> Is that when it happens? Interesting.
<Polarfire> Or, these days atleast, switch IRC networks again >_>
<Dashite> Heh
<Sumica> so which one is the "the text bar"
<Polarfire> The one you type in :P
<Pontang> Shouldn't be anymore network switching.
<Polarfire> Yeah, I was jk'in
<Polarfire> :)
<Sumica> Hi again Pontang
<Pontang> As long as the staff are satisfied, we should be able to hold their influx of users.
<Pontang> Heyo
<Polarfire> woop!
<Pontang> We're setting up servers right now that should hold whatever they're expecting.
<Polarfire> You got it Sumica?
<Dashite> So who is Pontang?
<Polarfire> That guy up there.
<Dashite> Don't recall seeing him around before.
<Dashite> Very helpful Polar...
<Polarfire> I believe he is one of the managers of the new network.
<Sumica> Not a clue Polarfire
<Polarfire> alrighy...
<Polarfire> Let's go here.
<Sumica> Pontang is one of the people running ponychat or some such
<Polarfire> #SumicaTutorial
<Pontang> Yep
<Polarfire> So I don't have to use up my Dari-warnings
<Colgate> hasn't been on in ~18 hours
<Colgate> or, at least not in this channel
<Stomper> oh ok
<Nittany_Tiger> About wondered where the activity went.
<KanyeEast> to bed most likely
<Sumica> Or hideing ^_^
<KanyeEast> or resisting watching the trailer
<Nittany_Tiger> What trailer?
<Sumica> the s2 spoiler one
<Sumica> Hi ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy sumica
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I take it the presence of DCD means the stream's going?
<Sumica> uhhh, no clue
<mib_6ms2vf> whats going on
<mib_6ms2vf> hello
<Hat> quiet
<Hat> in here
<mib_6ms2vf> opps sorry
<Hat> nono i mean you can talk, just its very quiet here
<mib_6ms2vf> im new here whats going
<mib_6ms2vf> all i get is a little circle thing
<Hat> i don't think anyone is streaming at the moment
<mib_6ms2vf> o
*Hat flies off in the wind
<mib_6ms2vf> woooooooooooooooo
<KanyeEast> well that was fast
<Sumica> Not supprising.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 honestly, I'm surprised it wasn't faster :P
<Sumica> Sety probably was off making coffee
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<Sumica> man Mr Frezze ep's of Batmand TAS were sad.
<ValtheJean> mmmhmmm
<ValtheJean> because you actually sympathize with him
<ValtheJean> 2,14 whereas in the retarded movie, you just want him to shut the hell up
<GGgala> hey, what did this mean exactly? "<Pontang> Should be more users soon. We're changing names." we changing the domain we connect to?
<Sumica> indeed
<Pontang> GGgala: the irc.bronychat.net will still connect. But the network itself is now being called ponychat
<Kabaka> The domain will be changing, but the old one will continue to work for a long time.
<Sumica> Oh FFFFFFUU hub, trying to make me watch the spoiler.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's really not a spoiler
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they aired it as a commercial
<Sumica> I am sure it's not all that bad but i still refuse
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but hey, to each their own :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fair enough
<Sumica> And yes they are showing it as an ad I assume.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fortunately you'll only need to hold out until saturday :P
<Sumica> I am sure I will give in befor that.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<Dashite> Fight the good fight Sumica!
<Sumica> lol thanks Dashite
<ValtheJean> 2,14 man...this is going to be the longest week of my life
<ValtheJean> 2,14 up until now I've just been like "hey, S2 will come when it comes"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but now I'm just like: "OMG WHY ISN'T IT HERE YET?"

<ValtheJean> 2,14 I...um...yeah what you said Tenure
<GrimGallop> o.o
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I really don't understand the magneto thing
<Sumica> It was an advertisment that was poping up during the last ep of the bronyville stream.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what advertisement?
<Sumica> For Xmen firstclass.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so...they made a magneto pony because there was an xmen advertisement?
<Sumica> It kep poping up thoughout the whole ep and I guess crasshed the stream when some one clicked it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah
<Sumica> they also sang a version of at the galla taht you would have to see to get all of it.
<Sumica> alot of jokes where made with magneto
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I....see
<Sumica> You should be able to find something on YT or on of the eqd post on it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, I think I'll pass :P

<DecapKing> i dont need to know spanish anymore

<RobotPinkie> So, can I ask you guys your honest opinion about something?
<DecapKing> http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/335737
<Daz> aww, but it'll be uploaded in 2 minutes... : /
<DecapKing> It's time for the hernando show!
<RobotPinkie> Does the world need another pony game project, or should I make it non-pony?
<Daz> Describe the art style, music (if any) mechanics, story (if any). What's the game about?
<RobotPinkie> I'm not big on story. I want to make a Metroidvania style game, though
<Hat> !
<Daz> try it out
<RobotPinkie> I've got part of the resource handling done already, but that's just technical stuff.
<Daz> guess who's recording and uploading MLP FiM Spanish Dubs to youtube :P It worked, and i can record (and even stream should I want to) television now. yay~
*Wrek disengages lurking procedures, beware of what you say
<Daz> Wrek, any news on part 7? also, so much this:
<RobotPinkie> I like ponies, Wrek. Is that okay?
<Daz> Part 5 - >NO THIS DOES NOT IMPLY SHIPPING. Part 6 - >Luna Hitting on Firewall.
<Daz> did you notice that?
<RobotPinkie> But yeah, I think I have the theoretical details down for how to make a Metroidvania style game with a pony protagonist...
<Daz> well do one if you want to do one
<EspyLacopa> Unicorn, Pegasus, or Earth Pony?
<RobotPinkie> Unicorn. Magic will play into it a fair amount
<Turgle> Pegasus

<RobotPinkie> No sense of comedy at all, Steven, I swear...
<Daz> RobotPinkie, i have an idea that's been on my mind a while now. What if I were to upload FiM episodes with each of the mane 6 in a different language? p'haps with subs. I probably will do this for myself aniways, but what do you think?
<Daz> maybe i'll put it on youtoob
<RobotPinkie> I think that would be pretty funny, Daz
<Wrek> 05it would be silly
<Saturn> egads, I thought that was my skype
<RobotPinkie> Is it out in 6 languages yet?
<Daz> funny and silly? IMO it would be awesome, great way to practice multilingual skills :P
<Daz> and nope RobotPinkie hence why i haven't made it yet :P
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay, lawl
<RobotPinkie> I'd like to see it
<Daz> english spanish french italian only versions i've seen on youtube. well, no spanish, but i'm now recording and uploading, so 'dealerwealer' will be the spanish fim channel on youtube :3
<RobotPinkie> Also much easier to just edit the audio tracks than video, too... though it sounds like it might take a while
<Daz> ep 2 is uploading now, says 10 mins to go :P
<RobotPinkie> Swedish versions of some eps are on Youtube, Daz
<Daz> and RobotPinkie duh! i ain't spending a bazillion years with a bazillion vids! just 6 audio files and one vid. also, link plox to swedish? :3
<Daz> (i'm adding to my 87GB of pony, all eps in all languages. gotta reach the 100GB pony mark ! )
<Daz> g2g dinner b back in about 10 mins
<RobotPinkie> Yeah that's what I'm saying, it's potentially an easier project to do because of that, and very fun
<RobotPinkie> alright, I'll try to find the eps by then, Daz

<DecapKing> what?
<DecapKing> i was playing the Warhammer 40k space marine demo o.o
<AllisZero> Holy crap, so slow.
<DecapKing> what is
<AllisZero> I think there's gotta be something wrong with the proxy, or the VPN configuration
<AllisZero> My SSL proxy, Decap
<AllisZero> I'm probably getting 128kbps tops right now
<AllisZero> Latency is also 1000 MS lul
<RobotPinkie> oh wow
<AllisZero> Scratch that, I'm getting 56kbps LOL
<RobotPinkie> wait, so how many kB is that?
<RobotPinkie> wow
<AllisZero> I'm getting 60~ kbs on speedtest.net
<AllisZero> I doubt it's the VPN itself, I'm getting 120ms pings back from my linux box
<RobotPinkie> but that's bits and not bytes?
<EspyLacopa> 8 kilobits = 1 kilobyte
<AllisZero> Right
<AllisZero> So 60 kbps = 7.1-ish KB/s
<Daz> 8 on-off bits make a delicious OM NOM NOM :P

<RobotPinkie> ah, that's too bad... was hoping I could set up my own VNC server easily
<AllisZero> Well, this IS going through WAN
<AllisZero> It was working very well when I was within my local network at home
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I want to use it through WAN too, don't have a local network at home.
<AllisZero> This might be the VPN client that's causing issues, or the Proxy software itself that's throttling how much I can use of the connection
<RobotPinkie> We'll see, I might be able to try out my own on Thursday
<AllisZero> On second thought, judging by how slow the RDP connection is even without going thru the proxy, everything is really slow
<RobotPinkie> and your upload speed at home is decent?
<AllisZero> Yep, usually 2-3Mb/s
<AllisZero> So I know getting only 60kbs isn't normal
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, that's definitely weird
<EspyLacopa> CUTEY MARK CRUSADERS DUNGEON MASTERS!
<AllisZero> YAY.

<DecapKing> yeah

<DecapKing> what?
<AllisZero> It's working now, I'm getting 3 Mb/s down, 800kb/s up!
<DecapKing> for what?
<AllisZero> My SSL proxy to a linux server I set up at home
<AllisZero> Essentially encrypts and masks all my web traffic
<DecapKing> i need to get that
<AllisZero> Even Youtube loads well, woot
<DecapKing> my max down speed when i torrent is like 2mb/s and 500kb/s
<MeteorVenture> so now you can watch ponies without ANYONE knowing that you're a brony?
<EspyLacopa> Why would you do that?
<MeteorVenture> cause "no one must know my secret"
<EspyLacopa> It's a secret?
<MeteorVenture> for some people probably so but i'm just joking around

<EspyLacopa> LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!
<AllisZero> Looks like something wasn't wrong with my PC here, not the Linux box or the VPN!
<AllisZero> I mean, was wrong with the PC here*
<Turgle> DCD!
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, nice AllisZero
<prince-dari> NewDCD, what's the rtmp link and stream field for our current strem?
<RobotPinkie> So that's a server side setting?
<prince-dari> stream*
<AllisZero> Nope, it was client side on the tunnel
<NewDCD> dari
<NewDCD> pm me
<RobotPinkie> Cool
<AllisZero> It's complicated to explain ,but I have this VM going through a connection that isn't our default at the office
<RobotPinkie> Can't wait to try it out myself
<MeteorVenture> discord is actually rainbow dash in disco mode
<RobotPinkie> What latency are you getting now, AllisZero?
<AllisZero> I'm getting around 300ms, but 3.5 down/800kb up
<Barry> I decided to try the original F-Zero.
<RobotPinkie> That's pretty good
<AllisZero> MORE than enough to listen to songs on Youtube and browse EQD
<Barry> Got to Sand Ocean before crashing
<RobotPinkie> Latency is still kinda bad, but great transfer speeds
<AllisZero> xrdp is doing a great job
<AllisZero> VNC is as fast as you'd expect it to be
<AllisZero> but vino doesn't work very well with Unity, it's better on Gnome
<DecapKing> I saw Unity
<RobotPinkie> Ah, that's too bad.
<Bommster> Bye people, I am going to #39;Brien), the awesome channel Steven showed me
<Bommster> wait

<RobotPinkie> Ahhh. Know if you can turn off transparency?
<RobotPinkie> or well, how bad does it break it?
<AllisZero> Not sure, my PC there is kinda slow to run Unity, so I prefer Gnome for now
<EspyLacopa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony <-- Huh
<AllisZero> How bad? Hm, the screen doesn't refresh when you have a transparency effect
<AllisZero> It's hardly usable :(

<RobotPinkie> Thanks. I'll have to wait a bit with reading it, still got too much to go through in the Physics book
<RobotPinkie> For anyone who hasn't read Repercussions of Evil: http://cdn2.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/096/878/original/and_then_john_was_a_zombie0.png
<AllisZero> LOL
<RobotPinkie> IKR?
<FreezeFrame> Five's Company is also awesome.
<RobotPinkie> So much I haven't read :(
<Charles> OOOH!
<Charles> I can't wait to see what it looks like
<Charles> how do you know it will be hitting torrents tonight?
<DecapKing> MFW I can't connect to the regular chat and have to go through mibbit
<VampirePrincess> brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<RobotPinkie> lol that one looks good from the prereader comments
*Charles snuggles VampirePrincess to keep her warm
<FreezeFrame> Five's Company is one of the "RD ships with everypony" parodies
<RobotPinkie> oh lol
<RobotPinkie> Is the other one also about shipping?
<FreezeFrame> It's got a bit of implied shipping, for the comedy
*VampirePrincess is also snuggling with her cookie on a diff site. :) but still.... they keep this building icy
<Charles> Crap, I need to go an partition my netbook HDD a third time
<Charles> wait, unless it will require a disc?
<VampirePrincess> huh?
<Charles> Windows 8 hon
<Charles> I need to prepare
<VampirePrincess> ohhhhhhh. :| comp tlk.
<Charles> sorry
<Charles> actually, I will clean my room first
<VampirePrincess> lol, hey i need to do tht too! lolol
<RobotPinkie> Well, I guess for parody purposes, I approve
<Charles> lol, wanna help with mine? you can tackle the closet while I handle the bookshelf area
<VampirePrincess> lol, um, i'm no good with closets.... mine used to avalnche when i opened the door. took me yrs to clean it.
<VampirePrincess> i'm a procrastinator
<Charles> oh, mine is really just messy in one corner, and on the shelves
<VampirePrincess> then u really dont got much to do. lol
<Charles> but but but I am lazy!
<VampirePrincess> lol, turn on some upbeat music and dance as u clean.
<Charles> hell, I have a crapload of food wrappers and boxes
<Charles> how the hell do I not weigh 300 pounds!?
<VampirePrincess> lol, fast motabolism?
<RobotPinkie> @chatmeter Dead
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Dead is 65% chat. (87)
<Charles> I guess
<Charles> I am sure work helps
<Charles> I lift things
<VampirePrincess> yeah tht helps burn lottsa calories and stuff
<KanyeEast> its dead jim
<RobotPinkie> It's life, Jim, but not as we know it
<KanyeEast> Damnit Jim, i'm a doctor not a pony
<Sumica> So I trust all of you are not connecting thought Mibbit.
<Turgle> im from XChat
*Dashite goes to connect through mibbit
<RobotPinkie> Why not mibbit, Sumica?
<Charles> crap, I am boned if the FBI ever come knocking, I have 5 cellphones in various states of breakdown
<Dashite> Heh
<Sumica> Cause the error I get when trying to connect via mibbit
<Charles> ( tear apart old phones we don't use, see what they look like on the inside)
<Dashite> Bye GGgala!
<VampirePrincess> ....
<VampirePrincess> oui
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay
<RobotPinkie> I don't even know which server we're on right now, it's been switching back and forth so much
<Dashite> We're on bronychat. It says so up top for me.
<RobotPinkie> irc.bronychat.net? .com?
<MantisToboggan> go mirc or go home
<Dashite> .net
<RobotPinkie> lolmirc, yeah sure
<MantisToboggan> pure irc'ing for pure purists
*Dashite slaps RobotPinkie around a bit with a large trout
<Flutteryay> wait GGgala was banned unfairly I think
*Dashite uses mirc
<Flutteryay> It was an honest mistake on his part
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, and if you're not on Windows...
<Sumica> yeah tryed that. it seems to suffer from disco's every 10 min so no.
*RobotPinkie slaps Dashite
*Dashite slaps RobotPinkie around with a bit of a large trout!
*Dashite slaps RobotPinkie around a bit with a large trout
<RobotPinkie> You can use mIRC all you like, I'm not knocking it.
<RobotPinkie> It's not the be all and end all of IRC clients, though.
<FreezeFrame> See, I'm a total sap, so I love shipfics
<Flutteryay> I'm using colloquy
*Dashite doesn't really care about which client people use. Just likes slapping people with a large trout
*Dashite slaps Sumica around a bit with a large trout
*Dashite slaps Wrek around a bit with a large trout
<MantisToboggan> why am i drawing ponies while listening to black metal
<FreezeFrame> I'm on a copy of mIRC I paid for.
<MantisToboggan> one of those has to go
<FreezeFrame> Not if you're drawing the CMC in their outfits from the talent show
<RobotPinkie> If one has to go, clearly it's the black metal.
<MantisToboggan> no it's applejack with a derpy face
<RobotPinkie> I don't mind the combination of metal and ponies, though.
<MantisToboggan> the derpyness was unintended but we're fucking rolling with it
<RobotPinkie> Well, Derpy was also unintended, so that's strangely fitting
<Sumica> so that kind of a title for a story with grimdark tag?
<RobotPinkie> I could guess, but I won't... :P
<Flutteryay> Do not want...
<Charles> bbs

<Rainbow_Dash> How can that be right? I must of done something to screw up my DNA
<Rainbow_Dash> :o
<RobotPinkie> Maybe someone else has been using your keyboard? :O
<Rainbow_Dash> Potentially...
<Silverscreen> Good evening.
<Silverscreen> or afternoon, whichever.
<AllisZero> Almost time to go home and I only got a single thing done all day at work :|
<AllisZero> Got rid of the 30 pounds of random paper printouts my boss left when he got fired
<RobotPinkie> Well, at least that something
<Silverscreen> Rawr
<AllisZero> Mixed, of course, with invoices, signed purchase orders, and other important things I need to keep
<AllisZero> So I had to go through everything :P
<RobotPinkie> ohay Silverscreen
<AllisZero> The bad thing is I mentioned my VPN tunnel to my assistant, so now he knows I'm up to no good haha
<RobotPinkie> and ouch, that's kind of a pain
<Silverscreen> Allo, Aloo
<Silverscreen> Allo*
<Turgle> aloooo
<jasperdett> wb Charles
<Charles> thanks
<Pontang> Hey
<Turgle> im downloading MLP from youtube
<Turgle> in HD 1080
<Turgle> but i can't find the episode 2 in true 180p
<Turgle> i can only download a 1440 x 1080 video D:
<Turgle> it should be 1920 x 1080
<Turgle> it's just a 720p video boxed in a 1080 >:C
<RobotPinkie> I had the same problem got 1440x1080, but also with black bars above and below..
<Turgle> :I
<RobotPinkie> had to download a torrent
<Turgle> do you have a torrent for 1080p?
<RobotPinkie> I just googled "friendship is magic 1080p torrent"
<RobotPinkie> Pretty sure it was the first result I used
<Turgle> btjunkie => blocked here in italy
<Turgle> gotta use TOR
<Silverscreen> hi.
<RobotPinkie> ahhh
<RobotPinkie> No idea then, I'm guessing The Pirate Bay has it.
<RobotPinkie> wait, is it against the rules to talk about torrenting stuff?
<Turgle> The Pirate Bay => blocked here in italy
<Turgle> xD
<RobotPinkie> lol I'm guessing not
<RobotPinkie> ohwow... Italy blocks all torrent sites?
<Turgle> eeeeeeyup
<Turgle> thanks to our beloved prime minister
<RobotPinkie> ahh, Mr Berlusconi
<Turgle> pfffffft
<Turgle> THE idiot
<RobotPinkie> Well, he's a crook, that's for sure...
<Turgle> thanks god next year i'll move abroad
<RobotPinkie> Cool, where are you moving?
<RobotPinkie> I mean Italy is a nice country, but I could understand not wanting to live there. :P
<Turgle> probably Norwich in the UK
<Turgle> ^
<Turgle> it's good if you are a tourist
<RobotPinkie> I <3 the UK
<Turgle> yay me too :3
<AllisZero> Sigh, this is gonna be a huge problem. I can't for the love of me get the Trunking to work on this switch
<AllisZero> OH
<AllisZero> SHIT
<AllisZero> I did bring the entire company network down but it works!
<RobotPinkie> trunking?
<AllisZero> Eyup
<RobotPinkie> lol I hope you brought it back up again
<AllisZero> I have a problem where my wireless clients are on a subnet controlled by a L3 switch, but they can't connect to any assets in the datacenter
<AllisZero> To fix that I need to have that subnetwork on the main firewall, and to get it working has been kind of a pain
<AllisZero> Looks like I was doing it wrong it seems
<RobotPinkie> Yeah that kind of stuff is beyond me.
<AllisZero> I was never taught much of the advanced networking that we actually use in the real world at school
<AllisZero> So I'm learning as I go
<RobotPinkie> I can imagine, very little of what I learned in programming class has been useful in real life.
<Turgle> same here
<Turgle> but i currently use assembly xD
<RobotPinkie> I'm not exactly allergic to low level, but I much prefer high level languages
<RobotPinkie> ...until something needs optimized
<Turgle> ^
<AllisZero> Eyup
<Ziltoid> I am return
<Turgle> if you use PICs you know why use asm
<AllisZero> Look at that, it broke again
<Ziltoid> stream down?
<RobotPinkie> ohay Ziltoid
<Turgle> *why i use asm
<Turgle> stream down, yessir
<Ziltoid> hey rb
<RobotPinkie> oh lol, microcontrollers
<AllisZero> My problem with assclowning with this is that the internet isn't the biggest of my concerns, but the same switch I'm dicking around with takes care of my ISCSI traffic to and from my server
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I do understand why you'd use ASM :P
<Turgle> :)
<AllisZero> So if I break something in this switch, my files can go kaboom
<AllisZero> Well, not really because it's not a glass cannon
<AllisZero> But I don't want to reconfigure my virtual server
<RobotPinkie> It could mess things up quite a bit though
<AllisZero> Yep
<AllisZero> But I know what it is now, it was working fine when my first interface was set for trunking
<AllisZero> By itself it went from trunking to static access
<AllisZero> So how I can't access it
<AllisZero> now*
<RobotPinkie> but you know how to fix it?
<AllisZero> oh boy here we go
<AllisZero> Yup
<AllisZero> Well alright, this will take more time
<AllisZero> Going home, see you guys in a few
<RobotPinkie> later, AllisZero
<Turgle> later!
<Charles> err, I need to learn to empty my recycle bin more often
<Charles> 101 gigs
<Charles> and here I was wondering why I only had 20 gigs left
<Zephirdd> Is it normal for EqD to hit 10M page views in... a month or something like that?
<Zephirdd> 30M was on August 21st, today is September 13th and they are at 39.3M
<Turgle> the Brony community is growing really fast :D
<Zephirdd> season 2 hype imo
<Zephirdd> :P
<RobotPinkie> Likely both, I think.
<Turgle> EQD has something like 192k page views per day
<Zephirdd> EqD has been online for how long?
<Turgle> i don't know
<MantisToboggan> it's baffling how much content there is for them to link to
<Zephirdd> yes
<Zephirdd> o_o
<Zephirdd> sure mostly its fics
<Zephirdd> but still
<Zephirdd> posts go as far as may 2011
<Zephirdd> still looking for something older
<GGgala_> pretty sure there's january 2011 posts too
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, though also maybe 4-5 comic pages every day, all that pony music, the drawfriend stuff...
<Zephirdd> yeah
<Zephirdd> its a LOT of stuff
<RobotPinkie> and yeah, it launched in January... though I wasn't a brony at that time. :P
<Zephirdd> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/01/news-blog.html
<Zephirdd> This is likely the oldest post
<Zephirdd> January 19th
<Turgle> wow
<Turgle> i discovered MLP in June
<Turgle> xD
<Zephirdd> So that makes EqD 237 days old
<Turgle> and almost 40M page views
<RobotPinkie> Same here, or well that's when I "joined the herd" anyway
<Zephirdd> They have aprox. 39.31M pageviews atm
<Zephirdd> That makes for aprox. 6911 pageviews per hour
<Zephirdd> since the creation
<Zephirdd> However, taking it from August 21st(30M) to today
<RobotPinkie> And it was probably very much lower for the first couple of months...
<Zephirdd> From the 30M to today
<Zephirdd> aprox. 16866 pageviews per hour
<Zephirdd> which is 2.44x more
<Zephirdd> yeah, I'd say there was an improvement
<Zephirdd> lol :D
<Turgle> ^
<Turgle> totally related bot
<Zephirdd> heh
<RobotPinkie> Goddamn those creepers scare the bejeezus out of me still
<Zephirdd> wat
<Barry> Hello again
<RobotPinkie> lol Minecraft
<Turgle> xD
<RobotPinkie> ohay Barry
<Turgle> creepers
<Zephirdd> oh right
<Zephirdd> never played it
<RobotPinkie> almost blew up my entire shelter...
<jasperdett> <BOPM> DNSBL -> pmkubaoh!OAXOLW@199.48.147.38 appears in BL zone rbl.efnet.org (TOR exit server) <<<<<< good to know that bopm is still working good
<jasperdett|laptop> yeah
<Charles> readying my netbook for Windows 8
<jasperdett|laptop> cool
<AllisZero> Oh wow
<AllisZero> How many years has it been since I've used an IRC Client?
<Charles> yeah, though I still have many hours before it is available for download (will be available tonight,but I am gonna give it some extra time to let the servers cool down
<AllisZero> Guys?
<AllisZero> Guuuuys?
<Zephirdd> hi
<Zephirdd> :P
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RobotPinkie> I felt the same way
<AllisZero> Alright just making sure. Been a long time since I've had an actual irc client.
<AllisZero> hahaha
<Turgle> xD
<Zephirdd> lolz
<RobotPinkie> back in the good old days of BitchX
<AllisZero> I'm buying a laptop
<AllisZero> Or at least I think I am
<Zephirdd> specs?
<AllisZero> Thinking of the Y470 from Lenovo - i7 quad-core Sandy Bridge, 8 gigs of Ram, Nvidia 550M
<AllisZero> About 5 pounds
<Zephirdd> woah
<AllisZero> The screen leaves a lot to be desired sadly, only 1366x768
<Zephirdd> I have no idea how much a pound is
<Zephirdd> but the computer seems great
<AllisZero> Around 2 pounds in a kilogram
<Dashite> 1lb = 2.2kg
<Zephirdd> oh
<Zephirdd> so it is similar to mine
<Dashite> Or rather the other way around
<Zephirdd> except the specs are much better
<Zephirdd> :P
<AllisZero> 1lb = 454 grams or so
<Dashite> Does the Y series have a trackpoint?
<AllisZero> Not sure, but I don't care for it
<RobotPinkie> aw, that's my current resolution, you mean meaniepants :(
<AllisZero> If it does I'll disable it
<Zephirdd> mine too
<Zephirdd> I think it is great
<Dashite> >_>
<Zephirdd> for a laptop
<RobotPinkie> lol
<FreezeFrame> So, I'm looking at Fluttershy Gets a Papercut
<Zephirdd> more than that, and the laptop is too big ;x
<Dashite> You people and your lack of appreciation for track point...
<FreezeFrame> My reaction is.... Wut.
<AllisZero> Well I'm saying if you compare the screens on other models of the same class, they all have 1600x900 and higher
<Turgle> what is it?
<RobotPinkie> lol I read it since it was so short, FreezeFrame... even though it's against my principles :P
<RobotPinkie> and grimdark? wat?
<Dashite> 16:9 needs to die when it comes to laptops.
<Zephirdd> ^wut
<AllisZero> Well, can't really help it nowadays
<Dashite> Aspect ratio. 1366x768, 1600x900, 1920x1080
<AllisZero> Most screens are going the way of 16:9 instead of 16:10
<Zephirdd> I know what it is
<RobotPinkie> prefer 16:10, or do you mean you want 4:3?
<Zephirdd> but why does it need to die?
<Dashite> Because there is little enough vertical screen real estate on laptops as it is and downgrading to 16:9 cuts back on that even more.
<AllisZero> I have to agree with Dashite
<Dashite> On desktops, you can always upsize, use portrait mode or add another monitor. You can't do that with a laptop and still keep it portable.
<AllisZero> Hmm, color-wise this client isn't great is it
<Dashite> What client are you using?
<AllisZero> ChatZilla as an addon to Firefox =p
<Turgle> i never installed chatzilla
<AllisZero> Liiitle better now but still names aren't being highlighted as they do on bronystate
<Turgle> xchat?
<AllisZero> Oh wow, this other Lenovo model has a blu-ray burner
<WhatPayne> Ugh that aspect thing reminds me. Why the hell some movies come in that 4:3 Pan&Scan ratio that cuts off sides of the movie?
<WhatPayne> I mean who would want to watch movie that has sides missing?
<Dashite> Because people wanted fullscreen movies for their 4:3 CRT TVs.
<Zephirdd> ...
<Turgle> LOL
<WhatPayne> But thats dumb
<Dashite> But that's the consumer public.
<WhatPayne> And the other thing is that they advertise the Widescreen as "special feature"
<AllisZero> Argh, this is challenging.
<AllisZero> It's a VERY nice laptop for the price, but I'm not sure I need all of it.
<RobotPinkie> and that's why Blu Ray is better than DVD...
<RobotPinkie> ...though they still cut the sides sometimes to fit 16:9
<RobotPinkie> which drives me cupcakes
<Dashite> That has nothing to do with BR vs DVD. O.o
<WhatPayne> Well hopefully in future with widescreen tv's that trend dies away.
<Dashite> We still have black bars. :(
<RobotPinkie> Eh? Name one Blu Ray which is in 4:3
<RobotPinkie> ...and shouldn't be :P
<Dashite> Name a major DVD that is only in 4:3
<AllisZero> The Star Wars box set!
<RobotPinkie> No major ones are only in 4:3 anymore, I don't think.
*AllisZero trolololol
<WhatPayne> Nothing makes me more angry than accidentally buying movie that is 4:3 aspect. (At least back in VHS days)
<prince-dari> People in mibbit can't connect at all I don't think.
<Awesomeshy> ohai
<RobotPinkie> Some minor releases are still available only in 4:3
<Awesomeshy> what
<Awesomeshy> so I guess adding the mibbit password didn't work
<WhatPayne> Luckily these days the 4:3 is no longer de facto standard
<prince-dari> "chat Closing Link: [109.169.29.95] (CGI:IRC -- Invalid password)"
<prince-dari> Adding the mibbit password?
<Awesomeshy> are you serious
<Awesomeshy> I think they added the wrong password
<Awesomeshy> at mibbit
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Awesomeshy> lemme try something
<Dashite> Oh hey, Wing Commander 3 is on GOG
<WhatPayne> But somewhy the TV's in my country still show the 4:3 movies.
<RobotPinkie> Imported Non ho Sonno from the US so I could get it in 24fps... only 4:3 :(
<Dashite> They do the same on TV here, at least in SD. The HD channels are all in widescreen.
<WhatPayne> Every time they would air any James Bond movie it's the cut off version.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Corevette789> Windows 8 is coming out?
<Pontang> Mibbit works here now it seems.
<RobotPinkie> That sucks :(
<prince-dari> I just tested mibbit.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<WhatPayne> Yeah it does
<Corevette789> Is that a server OS or a personal OS
<MaxwellTheScribblenaut> Anybody hoooooome hoooome hoooomeee hommmeee
<Pontang> But Awesomeshy probably gave them the bronychat one too.
<Pontang> :I
<prince-dari> Ah.
<prince-dari> That's when you try to connect irc.ponychat.net
<Charles> Personal
<prince-dari> irc.bronychat.net gives the error.
<Charles> and it is not coming out, technically
<Corevette789> Well
<Charles> but the developer build version is
<prince-dari> irc.bronychat.net: Closing Link: [207.192.75.252] (CGI:IRC -- Invalid password)
<Awesomeshy> tell me if that worked
<Awesomeshy> what
<Awesomeshy> it's still
<Charles> so it is only a matter of time befoe the full version is ready for purchase
<Awesomeshy> yeah they have the password wrong at mibbit
<RobotPinkie> of course, Blu Ray really has more appeal to Europeans in some ways
<Pontang> =I
<WhatPayne> And it's the kind of cut off where the first few minutes are in widesceen and you think "oh good, proper aspect this time" but then at the credit sequence it's like "nope back to 4:3"
<Turgle> really? xD
<Corevette789> "purchase"
<Awesomeshy> I'll just replace the right one with the wrong one
<MeteorVenture> goodnight fellows it's time for me to sleep
<Awesomeshy> >yfw I know the wrong password
<prince-dari> Oh wait.
<Turgle> bye!
<Turgle> uh
<prince-dari> It's working now.
<RobotPinkie> DVDs are sped up by 4% here
<Awesomeshy> r u srs
<WhatPayne> cya
<RobotPinkie> night MeteorVenture
<Turgle> i'm starting to watch Usagi Drop!
<Pontang> ;x
<MeteorVenture> ah i see
<Charles> yes
<Awesomeshy> Sorry for the trouble
<prince-dari> Let me check the mibbit embed on our site - see if that works too.
<WhatPayne> Oh yeah the PAL NTSC conversion speeding up...
<Charles> Dev build is free, if I read right
<MeteorVenture> i'll ask about it later lol
<AllisZero> Latitude E6520 Core i5-2520M 15.6" 1600x900 Laptop (NVIDIA NVS 420M) $607
<Turgle> bye!
<Awesomeshy> also keep the embedd at bronychat.net
<MeteorVenture> cya:D
<AllisZero> Oh shit, $607? I'm gonna buy like 4 at work
<Awesomeshy> we're not exactly done here yet
<Charles> but you can bet the finished product of Windows 8 will follow the same pricing scheme as windows 7
<Pontang> Some of them work.
<RobotPinkie> Doesn't bug all people, but in many movies they don't do pitch correction
<AllisZero> Night MeteorVenture
<Pontang> Others do not.
<prince-dari> Hmm
<RobotPinkie> and that just drives me crazy :P
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<prince-dari> That's annoying.
<Pontang> Awesomeshy: why exactly did you give them bronychat.net too? Seems a bit silly.
<Corevette789> Will there be a huge difference between Dev build and the final prouduct?
<Corevette789> I'll probably just do a Virtual boot
<WhatPayne> You only notice the speeding up if you do like first watch the version from say online, and later see the movie in tv/dvd and think "why it feels like they go slightly faster?"
<Awesomeshy> because we're going to be changing it to work with ponychat
<Awesomeshy> and I was half thinking
<WhatPayne> And then you realize
<Pontang> :(
<Awesomeshy> I'm not proud of what I did
<Awesomeshy> I'm not denying it either
<prince-dari> So when's this going to be fixed?
<Natleyn> Why won't mibbit let me in? :(
<prince-dari> Because none of our mibbit users (most of them) can join. :/
<Turgle> bad mibbit!
<RobotPinkie> again, pitch. The speed difference is negligible in most movies
<prince-dari> Because our network admins derped the CGI IRC block.
<Awesomeshy> is it working now?
<Natleyn> It keeps yelling at me about some kind of bad password.
<Natleyn> Oh.
<Dashite> :/
<Natleyn> Well, at least I have mIRC.
<Natleyn> Hiya Val
<Awesomeshy> Kabaka: about that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hello
<Awesomeshy> when should we be done
<AllisZero> Aye, I had to install Chatzilla myself
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: see #opers
<mib_mafkg3> whoa
<Turgle> this is probably why tonight we have only 25 users
<MrChang> what happened to the chat before
<Natleyn> Probably.
<RobotPinkie> oh lol
<RobotPinkie> That explains a lot
<Charles> I would imagine there will be enough of a difference to discourage the average joe from going out trying to get by just using a dev build
<MrChang> i was trying to log in before
<Turgle> IRC client strikes again
<MrChang> oh irc was on the fritz?
<Turgle> yep
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie the pitch change is only problematic when you listen the movie's TV series music soundtrack
<WhatPayne> ChatZilla=BestZilla
<RobotPinkie> Sure, that doesn't mean it's a good thing, WhatPayne
<MrChang> where's the real pinkie?
<MrChang> i want some huggin'
<prince-dari> No, still not working.
<WhatPayne> No it's not because the music is pitch higher
<MrChang> also
<MrChang> who was streaming before?
<MrChang> i saw some pony tf2 crap going on
<Turgle> dari
<prince-dari> ?
<MrChang> what kinda nonsense was that?
<Turgle> LOL
<WhatPayne> And pitch change in music is much more noticeable than in speech
<Turgle> suggested playlist
<AllisZero> Oh, I guess looking at retail stores is a bad idea since I need to finance this shit
<RobotPinkie> I just prefer not having that distortion, even if it's unnoticeable in some cases
<MrChang> who suggested it?
<Turgle> just to troll some ops
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dari? you're still online bro?
<MrChang> jeez
<AllisZero> He is, indeed
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Turgle> (wow, i have 10s lag)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you're such a trooper dari :P
<RobotPinkie> but every silly technical issue in movies will be solved once we all move to completely digital distribution
<WhatPayne> I hope
<RobotPinkie> Blu Ray and DVD work for now. I have no problems importing movies :P
<Awesomeshy> alright
<Awesomeshy> how about now
<Awesomeshy> sorry, again
<WhatPayne> Once we get things like region locks away and localizations to all DVD's/Blu-Rays then things will be peachy
<Awesomeshy> this is completely my fault and I apologize
<prince-dari> Well, can't be helped now, so it doesn't matter.
<RobotPinkie> myeah, I'm really not liking the region lock on Blu Ray
<WhatPayne> That's what I hope
<AllisZero> Eh, I'd love to see that happen but it'll never happen so long as humans exist
<prince-dari> It's still not working.
<Turgle> ValtheJean, this is why i hate your background text color
<Turgle> http://i.imgur.com/3vQgg.png
<AllisZero> "What's that? You can buy a japanese DVD from japan and watch it in North America? PREPOSTEROUS"
<prince-dari> Hmm
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why is my text highlighted?
<AllisZero> "We must punish these hackers"
<prince-dari> It opened the channel, but shows no users/topic/anything.
<prince-dari> And the connection hasn't shown up for me when I check mIRC.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Turgle> because i can't read the text if i don't highlight it
<Dashite> So people on proper black backgrounds can read it.
<RobotPinkie> Well, at least you can buy Japanese Blu Rays and play them in the US :P
<AllisZero> Improvement!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well that's your clients issue. I've already gone through 3 other variations so people can read my text, I'm done changing it
<prince-dari> Now all it does it show a blank screen.
<prince-dari> Even though it thinks it has connected./
<Turgle> D:
<Turgle> ooook
<WhatPayne> The problem in here is that in most foreign releases are missing one key detail we Scandinavians like
<RobotPinkie> You can probably change the color settings in your IRC client
<WhatPayne> That's called subtitles
<prince-dari> Ahh, back to invalid password.
<Pontang> Tell your client users to link to irc.ponychat.net. And update your client for irc.ponychat.net. We're going to go ahead and kill the old servers.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<RobotPinkie> eh, I don't mind just having English subs
<prince-dari> Give me a while to do that, the users are getting pretty fed up with being shunted all over the place.
<RobotPinkie> and if no subs, I just download them from teh intarwebs :P
<Pontang> I know.
<Awesomeshy> Pontang: are you on bronychat?
<Pontang> Sorry about all of this.
<WhatPayne> I don't either but some people do need them
<RobotPinkie> That doesn't work with Blu Ray unfortunately
<Pontang> I don't have my oper pass.
<Awesomeshy> k, I'll do it then
<prince-dari> I need to update the server address for this network.
<WhatPayne> And also I do the same, except there are no easy ways to get external subtitles on your Blu-Ray unless you watch from PC
<RobotPinkie> Do iTunes movies have subtitles?
<prince-dari> So everyone needs to move again. :P
<Pontang> But there really shouldn't be an issue since we're putting bronychat.net to ponychat.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<RobotPinkie> aw :(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<prince-dari> And new services, so all the channels and nicks need to be registered again.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 where to now Dari? :P
<Natleyn> Where to?
<AllisZero> （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<prince-dari> Same network, but because of a merge, irc.ponychat.net
<Dashite> >_<
<RobotPinkie> To mibbit!
<Dashite> （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<WhatPayne> Again?
<RobotPinkie> ponychan merge?
<RobotPinkie> omg
<prince-dari> Sorry guys, not much I can do about it. :|
<RobotPinkie> How scandalous
<Turgle> ^
<AllisZero> It's cool Dari, we'll do what we have to
<Turgle> so we change?
<Pontang> We're adding more servers to support everyone.
<RobotPinkie> It's alright
<Turgle> like...
<Turgle> now?
<Rainbow_Dash> Oh dear. Again?
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'm just switching the mibbit embeds. :<
<WhatPayne> It's so hard to type that whole nic register line, oh my god!
<WhatPayne> *sarcasm
<Turgle> ok ppl, time to move
<Rainbow_Dash> So do we just need to refresh the page?
<WhatPayne> Oh what's the new IRC address?
<prince-dari> I haven't updated the site yet.
<prince-dari> irc.ponychat.net
<Natleyn> Hiya Dari.
<AllisZero> ponychan doesn't like me
<WhatPayne> already up?
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Natleyn> >w>
<Natleyn> I'm on it
<Turgle> HEY
<Natleyn> Hiya Turgle
<Turgle> i did it
<Turgle> xD
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Natleyn> Dari, is Nickserv up?
<prince-dari> Yes.
<AllisZero> You can only get 35 people per server?
<Natleyn> ... huh.
<prince-dari> Services are up, you can see chanserv.
<prince-dari> :P
<RobotPinkie> time for more caffeine injections...
<Natleyn> Nickserv isn't responding.
<Natleyn> Weird.
<prince-dari> Different services.
<prince-dari> Not on anope any more.
<Pontang> prince-dari: you can add a bot if you want. You can choose from the mane 6.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 though am I still on the color script? :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no warning, huzzah!
<Pontang> You won't get a +r anymore.
<Natleyn> Hrm.
<Pontang> But you are registered Natleyn
<prince-dari> I'm more used to channel flags anyway, so meh.
<Natleyn> Oh oh!.
<WhatPayne> Planning to stay up for long?
<Turgle> wohoo i can read what ValtheJean write!
<Natleyn> Nickserv wasn't posting messages to me in #bronystate is all.
<prince-dari> Services usually send you notices anyway.
<Turgle> ok guys, server's up
<prince-dari> Whether you're in a channel or not is irrelevant.
<Turgle> switch to irc.ponychat.net/6667 #bronystate
<WhatPayne> So this address will become obsolete?
<Natleyn> Every IRC I've been in before would have nick/chan post to you in your active channel. >_>
<Turgle> probably
<MrChang> how do we switch to that?
<prince-dari> That's by preference of the client you are using, not the services.
<prince-dari> Almost all services send you notices.
<prince-dari> As that is the standard protocol.
<WhatPayne> So I can safely remove this from my auto connect list?
<Turgle> if you are logged with mibbit you have to wait that dari changes the embed code
<AllisZerofuu> Well
<Turgle> well, i'll keep it for a while xD
<FlutterBro> hi
<Barry1> Hi
<MrChang> where can i DL irc chat client
<mib_mztd61> hello
<AllisZerofuu> Chatzilla doesn't like ponychat
<MrChang> is it mirc?
<Turgle> google XChat
<mib_mztd61> [](/b24)
<Turgle> or mirc
<mib_mztd61> nope
<Turgle> or Chatzilla
<Barry1> B-22!
<prince-dari> What do you mean AllisZerofuu?
<Turgle> or whatever
<MrChang> which is the best in your opinions?
<WhatPayne> I use ChatZilla
<WhatPayne> It's relatively easy to use.
<Turgle> i use xchat
<prince-dari> Mibbit links are updated/
<Pontang> I used chatzilla yesterday.
<Rainbow_Dash> Refresh page?
<Turgle> so refresh!
<prince-dari> Xchat is probably one of the best, but I like mIRC the most.
<AllisZerofuu> It connects fine, but if I try to join the chat it goes into a reconnection loop
<RobotPinkie> okay, see you guys over there
<MrChang> uh
<RobotPinkie> ohay ponies
<AllisZerofuu> Hai
<Turgle> hey all!
<Turgle> welcome back!
<WhatPayne> ChatZilla is good if you like to keep Firefox on most of the time.
<MrChang> uh
<FreezeFrame> Is this the last one?
<MrChang> is this it?
<MrChang> =\
<AllisZero> We're moving till the job is done!
<RobotPinkie> Spoiler: S2 will be SO. AWESOME. /)^3^(\
<MP> Crap crap crap....
<prince-dari> Nope.
<MrChang> im confused.
*ValtheJean 2,14 bans RobotPinkie :P
<prince-dari> Etiher clear your cache or close and reopen your browser.
<Turgle> suddenly: RobotPinkie perma-banned
<MrChang> okay
<KanyeEast> i'm trying my hardest not to get spoilered
<MP> It's Fluttershy btw but it's not letting me sign in with it
<RobotPinkie> NNNNOOOOO
<prince-dari> MFW Val can't ban yet.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well we're do our best to make sure that doesn't happen kanye
<prince-dari> I haven't set your flags. :P
<FlutterBro> I got in with FlutterBro just fine
<MrChang> is it working
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and dari! SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<MrChang> nope.
<MP> It says 'Fluttershy' is already in use
<WhatPayne> Why would you want to ban RobotPinkie?
<FlutterBro> I just had to reregister the nick
<Silvermane> MP, guess who owns a channel...
<KanyeEast> all I know is that there will be a lot of star trek crossovers after the first episode
<RobotPinkie> Because of spoilers :P
<Turgle> xD
<Turgle> what are you using?
<WhatPayne> You has spoilered?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 as much as I want to talk about S2, we are making sure that we keep the spoilers in check
<KanyeEast> mums the word
<MP> prince-dari: do you know why I can't change my nick to Fluttershy without it saying that the nickname is already in use?
<RobotPinkie> <RobotPinkie> Spoiler: S2 will be SO. AWESOME. /)^3^(\
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we want this to be a nice place for everyone, so deterring people because of S2 talking isn't prefered :P
<mib_mztd61> about those spoilers
<mib_mztd61> whats really to spoil?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, sorry if you wanted to find that out first hand :(
<WhatPayne> I spoilerereeded myself
<MrChang> i just dled chatzilla
<mib_mztd61> I didn't pick much up from the clip
<Pontang> MP: we decided that the bots will be named after the mane 6.
<FreezeFrame> Not everyone watched the spoiler clip
<WhatPayne> -earlier today
<ValtheJean> 2,14 anon: we're mostly just jumping the gun here
<Pontang> So no one will use those nicknames.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 even though I agree with you, we want to set this rule now
<Turgle> ok, so you probably have a network list
<MrChang> how do i connect
<Pontang> You can add a bot of your favorite pony of course.
<Pontang> :p
<Turgle> or something like this
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so there's no confusion
<MrChang> yeah
<MP> That's... not really fair. I've been using Fluttershy from the beginning
<Turgle> right?
<MrChang> Available networks are [dalnet, efnet, freenode, hispano, ircnet, moznet, quakenet, serenia, slashnet, solidirc, undernet, webbnet].
<mib_mztd61> SPOILER WARNING: RARITY IS BEST PONY
<RobotPinkie> I haven't spoiled anything. I saw the pic from the spoiler clip before Sethisto de-spoilered it, but that's it
<WhatPayne> TBH that clip just spiked my interest in season 2
<Turgle> ok
<KanyeEast> I agree mib
<Turgle> add new network
<MP> And I was really hoping to continue using that nickname...
<Pontang> MP: there will be other users who want it. We want to be fair to everyone.
<RobotPinkie> Silly anon, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie!
<Turgle> must be: irc.ponychat.net
<Pontang> So it's best to just not let anyone have them.
<WhatPayne> Only thing to spoil is what kind of the baddie will be...
<Turgle> and channel #bronystate
<MrChang> how to add new?
<MP> I've already /been/ using it though and nobody has gotten angry with me so far
<`Fluttershy> MP
<`Fluttershy> <---
<`Fluttershy> You still use that :P
<Turgle> there should be a button somewhere
<FlutterBro> that'll work
<AllisZero> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/170/301/Twitableflip.png?1315092882
<Pontang> Yep
<MP> -sighs- Alright
*Natleyn hugs MP
<Turgle> "add"
<Pontang> I used to go by _Sesshoumaru because Sesshoumaru was taken.
<Pontang> :(
<FlutterBro> put a X or # in front of it
<KanyeEast> its okay mp
<MrChang> dont see it
<MP> but I'll do it Fluttershy' if I can
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, do you know how annoying it would be to do that?
<Dashite> Hmm...
<prince-dari> To do what?
<AllisZero> <3xXxFluttershyxXx<3
<Turgle> LOL
<Dashite> Damn, I can't add a @ in front of my name. :p
<MP> that... didn't work
<MP> Dari, how did you...?
<Awesomeshy> how's everything working in here
<Pontang> For mirc right?
<prince-dari> Copy-paste it.
<MrChang> chatzilla
<Turgle> chatzilla
<Pontang> Oh
<Dusky> seems good Awesomeshy
<Awesomeshy> I'm crazy sorry guys
<Turgle> i'm looking for the online guide
<The12thDoctor> hey, thats really cool
<Natleyn> What? WHy
<Natleyn> Why, even.
<Pontang> I believe typing irc://irc.ponychat.net in the browser will work.
<Turgle> 'cause i don't use chatzilla
<Turgle> wait a sec
<Awesomeshy> That whole thing that just happened
<Awesomeshy> my fault
<FlutterBro> yay
<Awesomeshy> totally sorry
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 nick spam :P
<prince-dari> That ok `Fluttershy?
<MrChang> fuck it
<MrChang> im dling mIRC
<Natleyn> <_<
<Pontang> :p
<`Fluttershy> it still makes me very sad not to be just plain Fluttershy anymore....
<Dashite> Damn, can't use % or & either. :p
<WhatPayne> Isn't Fluttershy the Streamception FLuttershy?
*Zacoda sips tea
<Awesomeshy> `Fluttershy: mane 6 names are reserved for bots
<FlutterBro> hey. Lets make me a pony! Whats the color scheme?
<`Fluttershy> Yes. I kind of made a name for myself that way too
<WhatPayne> Right
<`Fluttershy> I know the new rule but... it doesn't make it any less hard to take...
<Turgle> better
<Pontang> If irc://irc.ponychat.net does not link you, I don't know what will for chatzilla.
<`Fluttershy> I feel... like I've lost my idenity...
<Awesomeshy> :c
<`Fluttershy> identity*
*Natleyn hugs 'Fluttershy
<Natleyn> `... dang.
<Dashite> So how does the name work for mane 6 with two names? Is it RainbowDash or Rainbow_Dash?
<WhatPayne> There's still that other nic you had
<Turgle> oh c'mon you will be always the real Fluttershy here C:
<MrChang> wait
<MrChang> i've only 30 days
*FlutterBro glomps `Fluttershy
<prince-dari> Let's see
<prince-dari> !op ValtheJean
<prince-dari> ChanServ: >:(
<Turgle> xD
<WhatPayne> PinkiusPiacus?
<`Fluttershy> ....
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<`Fluttershy> I don't... I don't want to use that though...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 chanserv doesn't like me
<WhatPayne> I liked that one
<`Fluttershy> There's going to be lots of anger if the mane 6 are only bots though...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'll have to sacrifice someone with my trident in order to appease it
<Turgle> Pontang...?
<MrChang> whats the irc server
<prince-dari> !op ValtheJean
*Natleyn puts his hoof on his nose
<prince-dari> LOL
<Pontang> irc.ponychat.net
<ValtheJean> 2,14 HURRAY!
<`Fluttershy> Why not reserve mane 6 and other characters for mods?
<Turgle> irc.ponychat.net
<prince-dari> ChanServ doesn't strip control codes.
<Pontang> o>O
<prince-dari> FAIL
<prince-dari> Pontang
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I live again!
<Natleyn> ^Lols
<`Rainbow_Dash> I suppose this will have to do for now.
<WhatPayne> Actually I reckon it's better as to not have the mane-6 as takeable nics so there would not be figts over who can be who...
<prince-dari> ChanServ doesn't strip control codes...? O_o
<Pontang> prince-dari: yes?
<`Fluttershy> -lip trembles- but... oh dear...
<MrChang> ports?
<Zephirdd> isnt it
<Turgle> 6667
<Zephirdd> irc.bronychat.net
<Zephirdd> ?
<Turgle> nope
<Turgle> ponychat
<Zephirdd> for #bronystate at least
<Turgle> nope :)
<Zephirdd> huh
<Zephirdd> yep
<Zephirdd> I'm using iceChat
<Turgle> we are switching right now
<Zephirdd> and I connect via irc.bronychat.net
<Zephirdd> WHAT
<Zephirdd> AGAIN?1
<Zephirdd> OH JESUS F-
<prince-dari> [00:24] <prince-dari> ChanServ doesn't strip control codes...? O_o
<Turgle> xD
<`Fluttershy> My identity... my purpose in life... I... lost it all...
<prince-dari> For the in-channel commands.
<prince-dari> !deop ValtheJean
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 HEY

<Zephirdd> so
<Zephirdd> new server
<The12thDoctor> like fluttergirl or adorableshy
<Zephirdd> .... AGAIN.
<FlutterBro> FlutterSis?

<MrChang> WHAT
<Zephirdd> so I'm out of here to the new server
<`Fluttershy> I'm Fluttershy. I'm... supposed to be Fluttershy... ;_;
<WhatPayne> Streamceptionist?
<Zephirdd> cya
<MrChang> ok the IRC server is irc.ponychat.net
<Turgle> see there!

<Kabaka> prince-dari: huh?

<SHOObeDOO> xD
<Turgle> FIRED!
<FlutterBro> who wants to rp?
<Turgle> ._.
<Turgle> how
<The12thDoctor> only if I get to be the doctor
<Natleyn> Aight, 'nuff of that
<prince-dari> For the in-channel commands.
<Turgle> irc.ponychan.net?
<prince-dari> !op for example
<The12thDoctor> and wear a fez
<`Fluttershy> If I see the Fluttershy bot... I will murder it >:|
<MrChang> irc.ponychat.net
<Natleyn> Shoo be doo, shoo shoo be do
<Kabaka> Why would you include control codes in that?
<MrChang> who typed that?
<FlutterBro> a fez?
<Barry> Anyone know how to make an animated gif?
<The12thDoctor> fezzes are cool
<Turgle> Flutteryay, we are switching server
<FreezeFrame> Part 3 was up a while ago. Just took forever for Seth to update the post
<Pontang> prince-dari: when you add flags, you have to do something like +Or
<`Fluttershy> Wait.
<`Fluttershy> If nick changing is open... >>
<prince-dari> My script always uses colours in #BronyState.
<RobotPinkie> Make a layered image, then save it as GIF, Barry... I think that's pretty much it
<`Fluttershy> what about colors?
<`Fluttershy> J/K
<`Fluttershy> <<
<Kabaka> Hmm
<`Fluttershy> >>
<Kabaka> Well
<WhatPayne> Shutterfly?
<Pontang> You have to combine the flags or they'll reset I believe.
<MrChang> jesus fucking christ
<prince-dari> So I'm actually sending 2,15!op
<MrChang> its not working
<ValtheJean> 2,14 colors are handled by dari's script
<MrChang> i connected to irc.ponychan.net
<Kabaka> You can do /cs for all those commands
<MrChang> port 6667
<MrChang> unable to resolve
<Turgle> ok
<RobotPinkie> FlutterSmooze?
<Kabaka> Or you can the trigger to include your control codes
*WhatPayne is still thinking good names
<Turgle> try to delete the 6667
<prince-dari> Yeah I know, but the they're for lazy people. :P
<Kabaka> You can set any trigger per channel
<Turgle> and connect
<prince-dari> the in-channel ones
<FlutterBro> just let her be fluttershy
<prince-dari> Ah, ok.
<The12thDoctor> ^
<The12thDoctor> Don't be mean to her, she can sing!
<`Fluttershy> Isn't Shutterfly the name of a band?
<Natleyn> I got nothin'.
<`Fluttershy> >>;
<MrChang> i have to input a port
<Silvermane> Shutterfly is many things
<`Fluttershy> Or am I thinking of something else?
<WhatPayne> Of course there is that. But only if mods are nice
<`Fluttershy> What is top result on google?
<Turgle> well
<Turgle> 6667
<FlutterBro> Shutterfly is like Photobucket
<Turgle> :\
<MrChang> its irc.ponychan.net
<MrChang> correct?
<Turgle> no
<Turgle> ponyCHAT
<`Fluttershy> Huh.
<RobotPinkie> Only with less bucket and more fly
<WhatPayne> ZeMagics?

<The12thDoctor> psychoshy in the bottom left scares me
<WhatPayne> Sorry
<`Fluttershy> I'll... just have to live with `Fluttershy...
<Kabaka> No. Look at /cs help flags and /cs help template for a much more flexible system.
<WhatPayne> I was out of ideas anywho
<Kabaka> You can use templates like Anope's VOP/SOP/HOP/AOP
<prince-dari> Sounds good.

<RobotPinkie> Haha, oh okay

<WhatPayne> Why would you want to go to the moon?
<`Fluttershy> I LOVE BANANAS
<`Fluttershy> JUST SEND ME ALREADY
<Turgle> i don't think i registered my nick right
<LordCelest> Well, good thing you like bananas...
*RobotPinkie sends `Fluttershy to the moon... on a mission to gather apples
<Turgle> it didn't ask me for password or email
*Dermathil waves to all in chat
<RobotPinkie> Bananas are so last week.
<LordCelest> 'cause you'll find a lot of bananas...
<`Fluttershy> RobotPinkie: fail you did it wrong >> I mean I love you but...
<Turgle> wait
<Turgle> the command is /nick
<Turgle> or
<Turgle> /ns
<Dermathil> hello everybrony
<Turgle> ?
<RobotPinkie> Fail how?
<`Rainbow_Dash> LordCelest.. Wheres the rest of your name? -.-

<WhatPayne> I believe it logs you in automatically on register
*`Fluttershy happily flies to the moon
<Natleyn> I like LordCelest better, personally.
<Turgle> i never gave XChat my pass
<The12thDoctor> No, don't go to the moon. you'll get shot by Apollo astronauts!
<RDash> Turgle It doesn't have to be your email's pass, just a pass to use your nick when you log on
<RobotPinkie> I guess /ns does the same as /msg nickserv?
*`Fluttershy splats against the moon's surface
<Natleyn> Oh, darn, I forgot the maniacal laughter. -.-
<WhatPayne> aww
<Natleyn> Robot: It should.
<WhatPayne> Poor `Fluttershy
<Turgle> uhm ok - trying again
<RDash> If you register you have to type "/identify <password>" when you log on
<Turgle> kay
<RobotPinkie> Not really, XChat does that for me :P
<Turgle> hey VioletVanilla
<Natleyn> Hi violet :3
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanilla

*MrChang says wow
<RobotPinkie> Worse.
<MrChang> so
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie, What?
<MrChang> who here is interested for some D&D?
<prince-dari> The HOP template doesn't +h on join/identify.
<RobotPinkie> I don't even know, WhatPayne
<AllisZero> Used to play many ywars ago, MrChang
<RobotPinkie> I ain't even mad.
<MrChang> same
<MrChang> LETS GO
<WhatPayne> I'm too tired to try to understand
<Kabaka> There is no such thing as +h in Charybdis
<MrChang> i got my dice
<Kabaka> See /quote help cmode
<MrChang> everybody get their char sheets out
<AllisZero> But nowadays I don't think I'd really fit in anymore
<prince-dari> ...
<Hat> hey guys im having a banana
<MrChang> i was playing in the in early 90s
<MrChang> im 25
<AllisZero> Soooo
<RobotPinkie> Alright, MrChang, what are we playing?
<MrChang> cmonnn
<Natleyn> Have fun with that, hat.
<AllisZero> You're a bbbbbeeeyach
<AllisZero> WHO LIKES BANANAS
<MrChang> good ol fashioned D&D
<Hat> mmmmmmm
<Dashite> MrChang, what edition?
<RobotPinkie> BRP, Storyteller, CoC, d20?
<prince-dari> So other than +o and +v what does it have?
<MrChang> hmmmmmm
<Natleyn> It's not the same without LordCelestia threatening everyone
<AllisZero> Yeah MrChang I played back in early 2000
<MrChang> 4E
<Awesomeshy> that's it
<prince-dari> ...
<AllisZero> But since I moved to the US, haven't touched any of that
<Awesomeshy> wait
<Awesomeshy> flags
<MrChang> maybe 3? or 3.5..?
<Awesomeshy> or user modes
<RobotPinkie> 4th edition omfg you heathen!
<Dashite> Lol
<RobotPinkie> ...just kidding
<MrChang> 4 is the latest :D
<Natleyn> Yup!
<Turgle> I DID IT
<MrChang> lez go
<prince-dari> Yes, but there's no way to differentiate between the different powers of each user at a glance?
<The12thDoctor> Sadly I never got into dnd or knew anyone who was into it
<MrChang> i shall be the dungeon mater
<Awesomeshy> no
<ValtheJean> 2,14 4th edition sucks ass. 3rd edition all the way
<prince-dari> ...
<MrChang> master
<Pontang> It's not really necessary.
<Awesomeshy> why even is that important
*Natleyn brohoofs ValtheJean
<Natleyn> Thank you.
<Dashite> Valthejean, all the cool kids are playing Pathfinder now.
<MrChang> i dont wanna touch up on all the rules for 3E
<RobotPinkie> Jesus saves. Everyone else takes 1d6 damage from the fire trap.
<MrChang> pathfinder is the best
<AllisZero> I used to be a GM for a group of friends for a year and a half or so
<MrChang> :D
<AllisZero> Man, those were good times.
<Kabaka> Typically, channels will be arranged with regular users with no mode, trusted users with +v, and staff with +o
<MrChang> join the cool guys, val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nothing beats a Samurai/Kensai dual class
<AllisZero> I used to GM AND have a playable character
<`Rainbow_Dash> It doesnt seem to give a message when I invite someone. How confusing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 phfff, I'm a noncomformist
<prince-dari> It's necessary so users know who has what powers in the channel.
<AllisZero> I always got screwed though
<Natleyn> HEROSPIRIT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 even when I spell it wrong
<MrChang> ok
<herospirit> WHAT
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<MrChang> im starting to DM
<RobotPinkie> I always used to play Call of Cthulhu
<MrChang> GALSTAFF
<herospirit> IT'S WORKING NOW
<`Rainbow_Dash> HEROSPIRIT
<MrChang> you have entered the door to the north
*`Fluttershy is full of sadness....
<Dashite> Non-conformist? Alright! Time for some Paranoia!
<Kabaka> You've got +o and +v. Do your users really need such granularity?
*Natleyn hugs `Fluttershy
<herospirit> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ON FOR TWO HOURS.
<RobotPinkie> Excellent role-playing game.
*`Fluttershy goes into FLUTTERCRY mode
<RobotPinkie> ohay herospirit!
<MrChang> let's start
*`Fluttershy hugs Natleyn back
<MrChang> shall we?
<Natleyn> ;~;
<WhatPayne> `Fluttershy: Don't be sad.
<prince-dari> 'Need' no, but it's very helpful.
<herospirit> Has the server been down or does it just hate me?
<KanyeEast> I think it was down
<NewDCD> I think it's been down
<RobotPinkie> It's been rejecting mibbit
<NewDCD> thinkdownmind
*`Fluttershy sniffles. "But my logical side and emotional side are in conflict..."
<RobotPinkie> it was up, though
<Dashite> A little from column A, a little from column B...
<herospirit> I was going into withdrawl
<MrChang> You all start off in a quiet village and many of its residents seem to ignore your presence and go about their business. Though seemingly peaceful, you all sense a very dark and evil presence lurking about.
<AllisZero> They usually are, Flutterwooby
<herospirit> withdrall. Withdral. Withdraw.
<Awesomeshy> also I should note you may pic your own pony as a bot
<Awesomeshy> instead of chanserv
<Natleyn> Withdrawal?
<RobotPinkie> Southern drawl
<herospirit> Thank you Nat :D
<MrChang> eh?
<KanyeEast> I cast detect evil!
<MrChang> anybody want to join my adventure?
*AllisZero flips a table and mumbles;
<MrChang> i haven't DM'd in years
<Natleyn> No problem!
<Awesomeshy> (if you even care)
<Dashite> >_>
<AllisZero> WHY MUST IT ALWAYS HAVE A DARK PRESENCE LURKING ABOUT
<MrChang> roll check, kayne
<Turgle> hey NewDCD
<Dashite> We moved again.
<herospirit> What kind of adventuuuuure. :0
<KanyeEast> whats the command?
<MrChang> no clue
<Turgle> eeeeeeyup
<MrChang> lol
<VioletVanilla> 6Where to? o;
<RobotPinkie> I kinda need to read this dumb book, unfortunately :(
<MrChang> ill roll for you
<prince-dari> I'll ask.
<Dashite> irc.ponychat.net
<Turgle> ^
<NewDCD> I can't cycle the channel
<NewDCD> dumb fabric
<KanyeEast> i'm a paladin by the way
<Pontang> As long as you can enforce your rules, it doesn't seem necessary if there is a %/@/&/~ at the end of your name.
<MrChang> uhhh
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanilla
<MrChang> is that a +3 on roll?
<Natleyn> Welcome! :3
<KanyeEast> I think so
<herospirit> I have no idea what's going on
<prince-dari> Is it necessary to have a remote for your TV? Nope.
<Natleyn> DCD, I love you for fabric.
<prince-dari> But it's easier.
<MrChang> we'll make it +3
*VioletVanilla ish squished ^.^
<KanyeEast> You can call me Sir Kanye De East
<MrChang> 9+3, you rolled a 12
<Awesomeshy> actually
<Awesomeshy> with a lot of newer TV's
<DisQord> Hello there, El Capitan
<WhatPayne> Hello thar Violet
<NewDCD> WHY WON'T YOU CYCLE.
<Awesomeshy> you can't do anything without a remote
<herospirit> Is "Pants Magician" a class?
<Awesomeshy> just sayin'
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it hates us DCD :P
<KanyeEast> so does that mean it worked? seems a little low
<VioletVanilla> 6WRRRRRYYYYYYYY~~~
<FreezeFrame> 3rd or 3.5?
<DisQord> Saturday is getting very close
<prince-dari> Well I haven't seen any like that, and the point I was making still stands. :P
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo WhatPayne~
<MrChang> Sir Kayne tries to detect evil but, can only sense a slightly more than that previously
<KanyeEast> I hold back my burning desire to smite the town, can't see what I need to smite.
<Awesomeshy> the user modes aside, that isn't the only reason we went with the setup we're using
<Turgle> im off to bed, thanks RDash for the support xD
<Awesomeshy> I'm sorry for any inconvenience it causes for you and your users
*MrChang drops a Beholder in the party of level 1s.

*RDash was too late D:
<MrChang> Kayne
<NewDCD> apparently there was a network merger earlier
<NewDCD> that's why the chat wasn't working
<Natleyn> Yeah yeah.
<Natleyn> Dari told me
<MrChang> You notice the villagers have begun to recognize your powers
<WhatPayne> I rarely use hat emoticon :3
<WhatPayne> *that
<MrChang> They begin to scurry around town a quicker than usual.
<MrChang> what do you do?
<KanyeEast> Obviously they are up to no good, I try and grab a villager and demand he tell me what sinister evil lurks in this town.
<MrChang> gotta grab check
<MrChang> these guys are powerwalking about
<MrChang> trying their best to avoid you
<MrChang> okay grab and seize check
<MrChang> 18
<KanyeEast> fuck yeah
<MrChang> You grab a nearby villager and almost shatter his arm.
<MrChang> the quotes are going to be the NPCs
<KanyeEast> Thats okay, it was in the name of justice after all
<MrChang> "PLEASE SIR! What in the heavens are you doing? Let go of me!!"
<`Rainbow_Dash> Those are quite the flags you have there Prince-Dari
<KanyeEast> "Why are all of you trying to avoid a knight of justice? What sinister evil exists in this town! Do not make me smite you!"
*VioletVanilla is evolving.
*RobotPinkie isn't
<NewDCD> 9POWER
*RobotPinkie uses ponypounce on VioletVanilla
<KanyeEast> roll for intimidate?
<NewDCD> 9UNLIMITED POWER
<RobotPinkie> It's super effective.
<MrChang> "Evil?!?! There is no evil! It's just a busy day is all! People have to run many errands in our town, ya know!" as he stutters constantly
<herospirit> MrChang, is "Pants Magician" a viable class?
<herospirit> :0
*ValtheJean 2,14 Wields his trident with a manly pose
<MrChang> lemme roll
*VioletVanilla grabs her kitten army~
<MrChang> 17!
<prince-dari> ChanServ has a roll command?
<prince-dari> O_o
<KanyeEast> did I mention i'm also Samuel Jackson?
<herospirit> No, Chang has dice.
<KanyeEast> the paladin
<RobotPinkie> He's using actual dice, I'm pretty sure...
<RobotPinkie> ninja'd
<MrChang> sammy L?
<prince-dari> [00:56] -ChanServ- Syntax: ROLL [times] [dice]d<sides
<herospirit> Chang, what was that roll for?
<MrChang> oh that gives you an automatically +20 on intimidate
<MrChang> :D
<KanyeEast> i'm shaking down a peasant
<herospirit> Are you ignoring my question? :p
<KanyeEast> trying to get him to admit that theres an evil cult in the village
<MrChang> so 17
<herospirit> It was a genuine question.
<herospirit> Pants Magician is a respectable career you know
<RandomExtra> Yay! The chat's back up!
<MrChang> You intimidate the villager to the near point of lost bowel control
*herospirit is ignored once more
<Pontang> prince-dari: you can set gameserv on and it'll allow users to use !roll
<KanyeEast> "If you are lieing to me I will haul you to the nearest Chapter House and we will string you up for all the evil deeds you protect, tell me whats going on!"
*herospirit mourns over his inability to be a pants magician in this game
<MrChang> *begins to cry with snot running down* "Please sir, leave me be! I've a family to feed, if I don't bring this offer-....th-this package to the tavern, I won't have money to eat! Please sire!"
<herospirit> Okay, can I have a list of classes I can choose?
<`Rainbow_Dash> Forever alone Herospirit
<MrChang> !roll
<MrChang> aw
<Awesomeshy> !roll 2d26
<herospirit> @roll
<MrChang> not enabled yet
<herospirit> :[
<KanyeEast> Obviously this peasant doesn't know anything, I suppose i'll have to let him go and glare at the nearest people to see if they look suspicious.
*herospirit is forever alone
<Awesomeshy> prince-dari: should enable gameserv imo
<Awesomeshy> gameserv is bestserv
<Pontang> ;x
<Pontang> Oh hush
<Awesomeshy> no u
<ValtheJean> 2,14 That is an EqD post I am willing to go rush over and read :P
<herospirit> MrChang can I have a list of classes?
<MrChang> You let the villager go and he runs off clutching the backside of his pants
<prince-dari> Well not in any of our main channels.
<MrChang> Just then
<prince-dari> Maybe we could have a game/RP channel though.
<Pontang> prince-dari: we might be opening up a pony trivia channel.
<MrChang> A figure in a brown cloak with face hooded over approaches you quickly.
<prince-dari> Ooh, we have a trivia bot.
<MrChang> He immediately asks
<MrChang> "Who are you?"
*herospirit is not cool enough for MrChang's game
<MrChang> you can join if you'd like
<MrChang> but not as a pants magician
<Natleyn> Hero, you're already cool enough to be a beta tester :3
<KanyeEast> I pose heroically and announce "I am Sir Kanye De East. Knight of the Most holy order of the radiant heart. I sense a dark presence in this town." I try and detect if this particular brown cloaked person is evil.
<herospirit> I know, is there a list of classes?
<prince-dari> I didn't write it to keep scores, but I could do.
<MrChang> evil check
<MrChang> 10
<MrChang> failed
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.

<herospirit> Alright.
<`Fluttershy> LordCelestia: Um.... look it up?

<Natleyn> Tackle hug.
<LordCelestia> alrighty?

<Koakuma> zomg.
<MrChang> He speaks once again with an ashy tone "If you plan to muck around this town, I suggest you stay at the Tavern. The last thing you want is a Dire Wolf gnawing at your bones in the morning."
<Koakuma> how season 2 right now.
<Dermathil> that should be fking awesome
<MrChang> The man disappears in the blink of an eye.
<LordCelestia> YAY i like glompies!
<MrChang> *psst, go to the tavern, thats where i put hero in*
<herospirit> :D
<prince-dari> * Connect retry #1 irc.ponychat.net (6667) (dns pool)
<Zephirdd> "I hope they do a brony line of toys" OH YEAH PLZ
<KanyeEast> Obviously this town is actually full of evil but I should go to the tavern despite the obvious trap and threat. Thats where he'll least expect me.
<Zephirdd> *regarding the interview*
<KanyeEast> I go!
<prince-dari> It connected on the retry though.
<LordCelestia> imma gonna go work on part 2 of my fanfic
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, been listening to the interview for 6 minutes to the interview. So nice. <3
<MrChang> You enter the tavern quickly but, cautiously
<RobotPinkie> lolol I can't edit sentences
<MrChang> You find a stool at the bar to rest your feet.
<RobotPinkie> time for more caffeine...
<LordCelestia> what interview
<LordCelestia> ?
<MrChang> The Barkeep asks "What will you have, son?"
<Pontang> Things should settle by tomorrow.
<RobotPinkie> The Thiessen interview, it's awesome.
<Pontang> But it shouldn't be much of an issue as it is.
<KanyeEast> "I will have water, a knight does not cloud his judgement with spirits"
<Natleyn> GO. LISTEN. NOW.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, seriously, go listen
<MrChang> "Water, ey? Alrighty, comin' right up"
<LordCelestia> Yay I can work on my fanfic and read this at the same time! does anyone else here know about it already?
<MrChang> He hands you the stein of water and leans in close to whisper in your ear
<Pontang> And eventually the bronychat.net domain will link here as well. Just takes a bit of time.
<MrChang> "I heard you were ranting about evil in the town square today"
<AllisZero> Well, looks like I'm NOT buying my laptop luls
<Dermathil> >yfw I tear my finger off my hand in awesome from hearing the interview

<Dermathil> *72
<Awesomeshy> should resolve on their own after a while
<Awesomeshy> its*
<MrChang> "I haven't lived in this town very long but, I heard whispers of ritual occult sacrificings going on somewhere.."

<Dermathil> (indeed RobotPinkie. I'm going to die of awesome by the end I guess)
*Natleyn hugs Octavia
<MrChang> okay

<KanyeEast> i'll murder your face
<herospirit> And I am called...
<Dermathil> KENDERS
<RobotPinkie> Me too, Dermathil. Me too.
<Dermathil> Darn that thing makes me nostalgia
<Dermathil> (the kender thing0
<herospirit> Jimmy Bravebottom, Spouter of Tales
<MrChang> who else wants to join in on our makeshift D&D?
<herospirit> Also known as "the Exceptionally Annoying Minstrel"
<Stomper> hi prince-dari
*Dermathil usually plays a Cleric, but isn't going to participate.
<herospirit> (But we need a heeaaaaleeeeeer D:)
<prince-dari> Hey.
<MrChang> A young man, blonde hair and handsome with a harp approaches Sir Kayne
<RobotPinkie> I like playing warrior classes.
<Stomper> we havnt met yet, i was here friday and then went camping so i need to catch up
<Dermathil> (listening to the Jayson Thiessen interview, and MrChang, why not make another channel for the D&D?)
<herospirit> (JOIN US PINKIE.)
<MrChang> He notices that Kayne and the Barkeep were discussing about the omnious aura surrounding the mysterious town
<KanyeEast> I glance suspiciously at the bard. "Can I help you, minstrel?"
<RobotPinkie> Not today, herospirit. Had it been tomorrow, I probably would have :(
<MrChang> its better here, people can look and see if they're interested
<MrChang> remember, hero you overheard them of the evil talk
<MrChang> and you wish to adventure
<MrChang> all that stuff
<herospirit> (Alright.)
<Natleyn> >_>
<MrChang> be suave
*Silvermane offers the use of Dungeons&Ponies for D&D
*Dermathil agrees
<MrChang> alright then
<MrChang> same setting just everypony are ponies now
<Dermathil> (a D&D channel we tried to use back in july)
<LordCelestia> Im listening to the interview right now :')
<KanyeEast> then I'm a earth pony
<RobotPinkie> Yay LordCelestia
<KanyeEast> my cutie mark is a fist
<herospirit> (I am a)
<herospirit> (Erm)
<KanyeEast> A fist of justice!
<Natleyn> I'm gonna put it on my music player and listen.
<MrChang> its only 3 pony types
<herospirit> (I'll be a Pegasus Pony)
<MrChang> okay
<MrChang> continue the conv
<MrChang> on you, hero
<KanyeEast> I suppose instead of a sword i'll have to smite with my mighty horseshoes of justice
<Sleepieshy> it's been a long day
<MrChang> yeah converting items to pony-like is going to be hard =\
<LordCelestia> And sleepieshy is sleepie
<MrChang> well paladins really use 2h blunt weapons
<MrChang> hammmers, maces
<Dermathil> KanyeEast: hornblade
<Sleepieshy> and I have classes tomorrow
<Dermathil> MrChang: mouth-held
<KanyeEast> mage classes would be unicorns
<Sleepieshy> gnight
<MrChang> and pegasi?
<Stomper> good night duder
<KanyeEast> thiefy classes?
<herospirit> I sit on the stool across from the Paladin. I nearly miss the chair, but pass it off as a fancy way of sitting down. "I hear talk of evil and adventure to be had. Surely you will need a bard to be present, to recall your tales, and pass them to the next generation?"
<MrChang> on you, kayne
<Dermathil> I suggest not giving races as classes
<Dermathil> But magical bonuses
<herospirit> (bard Pegasus is best Pegasus)
<MrChang> The Barkeep gives the Bard a stern look.
<AllisZero> Wow, great. The morons at the dealership ran my credit 4-5 times.
<AllisZero> What a bunch of morons.
*Dermathil would love to be at BroNYcon but it is so darn faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar away
<MrChang> i live in nyc
<MrChang> but they're having it upstate
<LordCelestia> I'll fly over bronycon and see what its like
<MrChang> sooo...
<KanyeEast> I glare into the bards eyes, making a roll to detect alignment. "You bards know little of justice, spinning your tales to call people away from the right path. But you may be useful..."
<MrChang> alignment check
<MrChang> 16 check, success!
<herospirit> (Wait, so what should I say of allignment?)
<KanyeEast> well what is it?
<KanyeEast> you've got lawful, neutral and chaotic and good, neutral and evil
<KanyeEast> you've got to pair them up basically
<MrChang> You detect that he is a Lawful good
<MrChang> sorry i was refreshing on the alignments
<herospirit> (I was going to say Nuetral Good, but that works)
<MrChang> oh ok
<MrChang> neutral good then
<KanyeEast> A lawful good bard? lol
<KanyeEast> Neutral good is better
<Natleyn> Lawful good bard...
<herospirit> (Dem dirty bards)
<Natleyn> Might as well be a eunuch
<herospirit> (Okay wait)
<herospirit> (Nuetral Nuetral)
<herospirit> (sorry :P)
<MrChang> just stick with neutral good
<Natleyn> Neutral*.
<Natleyn> Neutral neutral is true neutral.
<MrChang> you're all heroes
<Natleyn> Yay, 'Tavi's an OP!
<LordCelestia> how do i invite people to my chat?
<FreezeFrame> Bards can't be LG
<MrChang> because they have loud mouths
<LordCelestia> anyone can tell me?
<FreezeFrame> Bards are required to be non-lawful, just like Barbarians
<herospirit> (:P)
<KanyeEast> I turn back to the barkeep "We will need a room, though we probably wont' be sleeping tonight."
<FreezeFrame> MrChang: Where is BroNYcon?
*FreezeFrame lives and goes to school in upstate
<LordCelestia> new york
<LordCelestia> lol
<MrChang> i don't know exactly
<Natleyn> Kanye: Oh baby.
<MrChang> im in manhattan =\
<FreezeFrame> LordCelestia: That's a bloody large area :P
<herospirit> I nearly jump the table in excitement. "Wait, wait, I'm in?"
<LordCelestia> hey i have aprivate chat i need 2 invite someone who knows how I can invite someone to the private chat?
<FreezeFrame> /invite <nick>
<KanyeEast> not like that natleyn
<FreezeFrame> er, /invite <channel> <nick>
*Dermathil is in a foreign country... Q_Q and New York was so awesome each time I visited...
<KanyeEast> I roll my eyes at the bard "Of course, you may prove yourself useful. Hopefully you are handy with a weapon"
<Natleyn> ;3
<MrChang> The Barkeep disregards the Bard's enthusiasm and says "I'll give you a discount and I really hope you two can get rid of this problem in this town, my customers look as though they want to kill me."
<herospirit> I scrunch my face in thought. "I once beat a crazed hobo with my lute."
<FreezeFrame> Dermathil: Did you ever go upstate, or did you just visit the City and Long Island?
<MrChang> the room is only 1silver for you two
<MrChang> both of you have 50s
<LordCelestia> who wants to go 2 the moon?
<herospirit> "...he bit me. It was self defense."
<KanyeEast> I hoof a silver bit to the Barkeep, moving off the bar to glance at the bard. "Come along bard, we have an ambush to prepare for."
<KanyeEast> i'd say hand, but ponies don't have those
<Charles> It's LIVE!
<MrChang> Barkeep asks the Paladin "You should shut him up on top of cleansing this evil, it's bad for my business. Lousy bards."
<Natleyn> >_>
<RobotPinkie> I'd love to go to the moon.
<herospirit> Ignoring the Barkeep, I turn my attention to the mention of an ambush."Should I use the heavy lute, sir?"
<FreezeFrame> Oh I don't want to live on the moon.
<MrChang> you two mingle
<MrChang> imma brb
<FreezeFrame> You now have Ernie's singing voice stuck in your heads
<KanyeEast> I sigh, heading upstairs. "If you don't have any other weapon than thats fine. You don't look like the type to get your hooves dirty anyway."
<RobotPinkie> Well I wouldn't want to live there, but visiting would be nice.
<LordCelestia> then accept the invite
<Dermathil> FreezeFrame: visited Manhattan, did the battery park ferry stuff, mostly around Central Park and Times Square though
<herospirit> (actually I have THIS stuck in my head) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMoTSltdShA

<RobotPinkie> This is the most amazing interview I've ever heard
<RobotPinkie> EVAR
<RobotPinkie> omfg
<MrChang> As you two mingle in the tavern room, you notice a brightness coming through the window
*Dermathil brohoofs RobotPinkie. "Truly Indeedy!"
*DecapKing glomps Octavia
<herospirit> "Sir, can you see that light, or am I drunk again?"
*RobotPinkie brohoofs Dermathil
<Octavia> 13o.o
<MrChang> The light gets brighter
<herospirit> "...Not that I drink."
*Octavia 13is glomped by Decap as usual XD
<KanyeEast> "I see it as well" I back up slightly and prepare for abttle
<RobotPinkie> I have zero doubts that S2 will be amazing now.
<MrChang> As you two analyze the window and light
<TrollightSparkle> Hai Octavia
<MrChang> You notice that it's a nearby torchlight
<MrChang> You hear shuffling outside, sounds like a dozen strong
<herospirit> "...Shall we, sir?"
*VioletVanilla hugs Octavia~
<RobotPinkie> I get no hugs today :(
*TrollightSparkle hugs RobotPinkie
*MrChang hugs RobotPinkie regardless of metallic build
<RobotPinkie> yay!
<KanyeEast> "It may be a mob, prepare for battle." I move up to open the door and confront whoever is outside
*LordCelestia joins in on hug
*RobotPinkie hugs back
<MrChang> you guys are upstairs

<TrollightSparkle> YOU

<FlutterBro> ?
<herospirit> I strum my lute a little while standing behind Kayne.
<MrChang> alright there we go :D
<MrChang> ok Kayne
*Silvermane hugs Octavia. "Because I haven't given you love in a while, despite being one of the 6 named best ponies."
<VioletVanilla> 6^ This.
<MrChang> As you peer through the window, you notice a small group of black cloaked, hooded people
<Silvermane> (are they chanting? Do they have wooden boards? If so, they probably want your dead)
<KanyeEast> I thought we were ponies
<MrChang> One has their hood off and you immediately notice that it's the same villager you've interrogated this morning
<MrChang> ponies* sorry
<herospirit> (I keep forgetting we're ponies :P)
<MrChang> For a brief moment, you remember his face and he quickly puts his hood back on

<NewDCD> 9hist cutie mark LOOKS like a Snail...but it actually is a targeting computer
<TrollightSparkle> Hello Purple
<herospirit> I produce a scrap of paper from my pocket and begin to scribble on it.
<herospirit> "...I'm writing a balad about dark cultists as we speak."
<RobotPinkie> Seems legit, NewDCD

<herospirit> I joined to annoy Kanye
<Natleyn> Foul Mouthed Lawful Good?

*Dermathil goes to visit #themoon by flying up there on his rocket lawnchair.
<Dermathil> (and it rhymed)
<Natleyn> HAHA.
<Natleyn> Rocket lawn chair.
<Natleyn> Nice.
<ctrlx> could an op check to see if there's a zline on an ip for me?
<Dermathil> Natleyn, that thing is in my posession since June.
<Natleyn> But but
<Natleyn> Metal Slug!
<RobotPinkie> I need some pony right now...
*RobotPinkie loads up the Season 1 playlist in VLC
<AllisZero> Feels bad man.
<Natleyn> Whats up, Allis?
<AllisZero> Didn't get the approval to finance the stupid laptop through the Lenovo website :p
<Natleyn> Awww :(
*Natleyn hugs AllisZero
<AllisZero> Funny how you can't get loans because you don't have credit history
<AllisZero> And you can't build a history if you don't have loans :P
*AllisZero hugs back
<RobotPinkie> That sucks :(
<ctrlx> i got a history by being a cosigner
<AllisZero> Yeah. Got mine stolen from inside my room, inside my own home
<AllisZero> So not very happy about that
<Natleyn> ;~;
<WhatPayne> Again, me bed, must, go.... Speech, turn, Shatner....
<Natleyn> 'night WhatPayne!
*Natleyn hugs WhatPayne goodnight
<RobotPinkie> night WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> aw, g'night
<RobotPinkie> I'm gonna be a bit afk, physics studies and pony eps running in the background.
<AllisZero> Night yos
<AllisZero> Right RP
<Natleyn> Listening to the interview now.
<AllisZero> I might go to bed soon, so good night to you if I don't see you till then.
<Natleyn> Took long enough to load my friggin' music.
<Natleyn> Well, now I can walk around and listen to music.
<Natleyn> feelsgood.jpg
<NewDCD> 9Oh God I had the greatest idea for my fic
<Purple`Prose> Oh?
<NewDCD> 9it's an idea that involves Big Macintosh and an "Orbital Bombardment Buster Weapons Platform"
<Natleyn> You will now spill all your secrets
<NewDCD> 9and SPAAAAAAAACE
<Natleyn> wat
<NewDCD> 9just imagine Big Macintosh beamspamming you FROM SPACE!
<TheJanitor> At least space is clean.
<RDash> 0.0
<Rainbow-Dash> Pontang, this is the mane channel on this network, right?
<Pontang> Yes
<Pontang> :p
<NewDCD> 9...that's going to be like 35 chapters from now though
<Pontang> It's the network lobby
<NewDCD> 9since I'm gunning for like 50
<Rainbow-Dash> Ah, I see
*NewDCD 9should start writing Chapter 5...
<AllisZero> Lol
<RDash> haha
<Rainbow-Dash> Seems to be rather overshadowed by BronyState ATM
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9this WILL take a while
<NewDCD> 9but still
<NewDCD> 9I like foreshadowing from really, really early
<Pontang> Most network lobbies are.
<NewDCD> 9basically the chapters released so far are foreshadowing up the ass
<AllisZero> It's ok DCD, I know how my novel ends, but I'm not yet sure on how it begins.
<Purple`Prose> Once the Big Mac is put into mass production...
<Rainbow-Dash> Well, back to swinging around a machete on Dead Island I suppose :P
<Pontang> =p
<RDash> NewDCD What's the name of your fic again?
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider Wyburn
<NewDCD> 9Yes, it's one of THOSE fics
<RDash> Lol
<NewDCD> 9that said
<NewDCD> 9it basically plays with a Human/Pony World duality
<NewDCD> 9A pony that goes into the Human world turns into a human, and vice-versa
<NewDCD> 9it's also a war story
<NewDCD> 9so it's a two-front war
<RDash> Ah, found it! You're on chapter 4 of 50?
<NewDCD> 9gonna write Chapter 5
<RDash> That may take awhile :P
<NewDCD> 9or
<Nat> >_>
<AllisZero> I should take note from you guys, really
<RDash> Oh, it hasn't been updated on EqD yet?
<AllisZero> I hardly wrote 3 chapters of my novel, in summarized format
<AllisZero> In the last 7 years.
<Purple`Prose> I really should work on my The Big Pink fic
<NewDCD> 9"How I justify the fact that I had a likeable Blueblood in my fic before he appeared in the series, and how I turn that into a character arc that might actually drop a few jaws"
<NewDCD> 9RDash: Yeah, Sethisto told me he had added it to the queue....like two months ago
<Purple`Prose> AllisZero; It's practice.
<Nat> Back to working on cursors...
<AllisZero> For me it's the age-old dilemma,
<AllisZero> I'm not a good writer, to add on the fact english isn't my first language.
<AllisZero> I used to be an exceptional writer in portuguese, but I'm below average when it comes to english :|
<Nat> You need an editor. :l
<Nat> I'd volunteer myself if I wasn't obsessively pursuing other things right now.
<AllisZero> Naw, it's alright. Thank you though
<AllisZero> But yes I do, but none of my friends are interested in doing it.
<AllisZero> Or can, actually give me feedback as most aren't native english speakers themselves
<Nat> I'm a decent writer, and a good editor, or so I've been told.
<Nat> Runs in the family or something.
<AllisZero> Haha nice
<AllisZero> My family also has some good writers
<AllisZero> Actually my grandma's side of the family, most of her siblings have either written books or practice law
<ctrlx> i would be a horrible lawyer
<RDash> I'm a decent writer, as long as I don't have to write about myself
<AllisZero> Jason sounds very homo
<AllisZero> Jayson*
<ctrlx> "the defendant is obviously guilty" ...."yah? well your mom is obviously guilty >:/"
<AllisZero> haha
*Silvermane likes the part where they all screwed the rules
<Nat> Anyone who's listened to the interview: "Ya kno"
<TrollightSparkle> Screw the money I have rules.
<Nat> Yeah trollight
<RDash> Alright, time for me to go to bed
<RDash> Cya everypony
<AllisZero> I'm gonna head to bed folks, kinda disappointed right now.
<Nat> Nighty night, RDash!
<TrollightSparkle> Night RDash
<AllisZero> Good night everypony
<AllisZero> Night RDash
<TrollightSparkle> And AllisZero

<Silvermane> @sexymeter Silvermane
<Silvermane> why is steven not working?
<Silvermane> :(
<Nat> Steven ain't here?
<Nat> Yeah, he gone
<RobotPinkie> He left a while back, yup
<Silvermane> aww...
*Nat pats Silvermane
<Silvermane> hey, think we can watch a 417 minute movie if I win the lotto?
<Nat> 0Why? o-o
<Nat> 0What movie?
<Silvermane> well... technically it was a mini-series, but it is compiled into a movie format now
<Silvermane> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207275/
<Purple`Prose> ...
<Nat> 0... oh, that.
<Purple`Prose> Why do I now want to write aHellsing style fic with Nightmare Moon serving as Alucard?
<Nat> 0Because
<Nat> 0FUCKING ALUCARD.
<Nat> 0And 'cause ponies are everywhere anyway
<Silvermane> Alucard is best Castlevania.
<Purple`Prose> http://youtu.be/7m3I2s7-mko Also this
<Flutteryay> It's ponychat, not ponychan
<Nat> 0^So much YES
<Patrick> Is this our permanent server?
<NewDCD> 9FLUTTERSHY, TRUE TO HER FEELINGS.
<Flutteryay> Freaking thing won't save the nickname I want to use and instead uses my real name
<RobotPinkie> Catching up on 5 days in 1 day, it's just not fun...
<Nat> 0ffffffffffffff.
<RobotPinkie> Fuck physics, I'm gonna levitate from now on
<Nat> 0Fuck transparency. Fuck it all
<Nat> 0Better yet
<Nat> 0The background
<Nat> 0Damn those checkered tiles
<RobotPinkie> That too.
<Nat> 0I like how I made the most mistakes when I was sitting here reading chat and placing each pixel one by one
<Nat> 0The best stuff was at the end when I was just clicking and undo-ing like a madman while listening to the SF4 soundtrack and giving no fucks
<ReticentSmolder> is there anything streaming atm? I can't see anything if there is
<TrollightSparkle> Not that I know of
<Nat> 0Nope.
<ctrlx> taco salad :3
<Nat> 0Jelly.
<Nat> 0Well... maybe not so much.
<Nat> 0I wish I had steven to tell me how jelly I am
<Rainbow-Dash> Going to bed. Bye guys
<TrollightSparkle> Bye Rainbow-Dash
<Nat> 0Nighty night Rainbow-Dash!
*Nat 0hugs Rainbow-Dash goodnight
<SuperBrony64> Hey everypony!
<Nat> 0Hiya SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> Awww, just missed Rainbow-Dash :(
<SuperBrony64> So, what's new?
<ctrlx> who all here plays minecraft?
<RobotPinkie> I do.
<Nat> 0Not anymore >.>
<ctrlx> enough people to justify me getting my minecraft server back up?
<SuperBrony64> I've wanted to play it…but I would like to try a demo first before I buy the game.
<Nat> 0Distracted by Terraria, then other things
<SuperBrony64> But the demo won't work for some reason on my computer.
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, you can play singleplayer for free
<ctrlx> oh
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx, Yeah, but I can't get it to work :/
<ctrlx> welp... there's a few reasons that it might be
<ctrlx> P:
<ctrlx> you have java installed? your graphics card able to handle it?
<SuperBrony64> So far, I've watched the Season 2 preview clip 37 times and I say we really need to push Season 2 to today...
<ctrlx> preview clip?
<ctrlx> D:
<SuperBrony64> Of My Little Pony: FiM Season 2
<ctrlx> is it that gif image of greybow dash?
<Purple`Prose> CURSE YOU JAYSON THEISSEN
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JbJvO_1hvU <--In case someone has not seen it yet
<RobotPinkie> Purple`Prose: IKR?
<Nat> 0Posting spoilers is asking for a ban :<
<SuperBrony64> Nat: It's not a spoiler, just a preview clip.
<ctrlx> ^
<ctrlx> omg speaking of spoilers. i heard that dumbledore dies D:>
<Nat> 0>_>
<SuperBrony64> It was posted by The Hub, not randomly leaked into the internet by some user.
<ctrlx> god my internet is so slow
<RobotPinkie> I don't think it matter where the spoilers come from
<NewDCD> 9also guys
<NewDCD> 9http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/303765_2184411007390_1160442515_32124576_1497997635_n.jpg
<RobotPinkie> though you did say what it was before posting the link, so it should be fine
<SuperBrony64> Besides that, don't open it if you don't want to know who a certain character is going to be in the episode...
<Nat> 0Spoiler is slang for any element of any summary or description of any piece of fiction that reveals any plot element which will give away the outcome of a dramatic episode within the work of fiction, or the conclusion of the entire work. It can also be used to refer to any piece of information regarding any part of a given media.
<ctrlx> i would say it's fine
<ctrlx> my spoiler is worse than his. even if it's from harry potter instead
<ctrlx> :x
<SuperBrony64> Is that from an official Batman comic?
<RobotPinkie> I don't want to watch it, though. :P
<RobotPinkie> That Thiessen interview, however...
<RobotPinkie> That was epic
<Nat> 0I'm still listening <3
<NewDCD> 9yeah 64, from the DC Reboot thing
<ctrlx> RobotPinkie, you got a link for that?
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD, Oh wow, so they kill 'that' person?
<NewDCD> 9apparently they removed his face surgically so he can fuck up with Bats even more
<RobotPinkie> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/exclusive-season-2-audio-interview-with.html
<Nat> 0Sweet mother of Celestia, I'm gonna have to hold off watching season one
<ctrlx> RobotPinkie, thakns
<SuperBrony64> Nat: Why?
<SuperBrony64> Oh, for the marathon, right?
<NewDCD> 9naw Joker is the one saying "it felt Fangasmic"
*RobotPinkie is watching Season 1 right now
<Nat> 0Dat interview
<RobotPinkie> You don't understand how much I love ponies...
<SuperBrony64> I don't understand why The Hub is playing MLP at 6 AM. Even as a kid, I wouldn't get up at that hour.
<ctrlx> it's at 7am here
<ctrlx> but it plays like 4 times in one day
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx, Mountain time, right?
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, central
<RobotPinkie> 6AM?
<Rayleonard8592> Central here
<Rayleonard8592> Hey guys
<RobotPinkie> Ahhh
<TrollightSparkle> Hello Rayleonard
<ctrlx> i dvr'd it :3
<NewDCD> 9it's 8AM over there I think
<Nat> 0It's 9am on a Saturday here, Super
<NewDCD> 9wasn't it 9AM EST?
<Nat> 0That's about right for every saturday cartoon, ever
<SuperBrony64> I hope iTunes has the Season Pass available the day it comes out.
<Androecian> 9AM Eastern?
<Androecian> For sure? O_O
<SuperBrony64> Nat: Yeah, but PST has it on at 6 AM
<ctrlx> i believe they have it back to back too
<SuperBrony64> Androecian: Yeah
<Androecian> AAAAGH dammit I'm going to have to stay up all night.
<Androecian> Worth it though :D
<SuperBrony64> Don't forget about the Season 1 Marathon before the premiere of Season 2 here.
<Nat> 0Well, poor PST children.
<Androecian> O_O Where and when is that SB64?
<Nat> 0And/or bronies.
<RobotPinkie> I don't think I can stay up for that...
<Nat> 0I WILL DRINK
<Nat> 0ALL THE COFFEE
<SuperBrony64> After Brony Movie Night Androecian
<RobotPinkie> I'll try though, I'm gonna power nap right before the marathon
<SuperBrony64> Nice, proper usage of caps throughout the statement *high fives self*
<Androecian> This is my first visit to this page. Dunno what Brony Movie Night is :/
<RobotPinkie> and then loads of caffeine
<Nat> 0For a moment, I got the feeling I WAS an artist
<SuperBrony64> Brony Movie Night happens every Friday in the evening. It consists of two movies played along with two episodes of MLP:FiM
<Androecian> Ahh :D
<SuperBrony64> One "A" Movie and one "B" Movie
<Nat> 0Sitting here, focusing on music and drawing without thinking too hard.
<RobotPinkie> Though this Friday there won't be 2 episodes
<SuperBrony64> This week's "A" movie is Blade Runner, while the "B" movie is *shrugs* My Little Pony: The Movie
<RobotPinkie> there will be EVERY episode
<SuperBrony64> What RobotPinkie said, there will be a Season 1 Marathon after the movies up until the premiere of Season 2 @ 9 AM EST
<Nat> 0 46 minutes in >.>
<Nat> 0God, I knew this was long, but...
<Nat> 0OH CRAP.
<Nat> 0I mean Celestia.
<RobotPinkie> Haha, I wished it were longer, personally
<SuperBrony64> …what?
*Nat 0shifty eyes
<NewDCD> 9I'll do the only reasonable thing
<NewDCD> 9STREAM ALL OF S1
<NewDCD> 9IN MY SLEEP
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD, do you have the magic to do so?
<TrollightSparkle> LIKE A BAWZ
<RobotPinkie> Such an awesome interview
<SuperBrony64> I tried cooking an omelet in my sleep, but then I died...
<SuperBrony64> True story.
<RobotPinkie> Seems legit.
<Nat> 0What are feet
<Nat> 0Pro, Nittany, pro.
<Nittany_Tiger> Stupid lame wireless.
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…what's a Ping timeout?
<Nittany_Tiger> Already did.
<RobotPinkie> That's when the IRC server gets no response from the client
<ctrlx> takes too long for hte client to respond
<ctrlx> ^
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh, what.
<SuperBrony64> So it delays the time for reconnection by 246 seconds?
<ctrlx> lol do wat?
<SuperBrony64> Or whatever time the mighty server demands
<RobotPinkie> Well, the time for reconnecting with the same name if you crash, yeah.
<ctrlx> no that's how long it took to timeout
<Nittany_Tiger> No, that's how long the client hasn't heard back from that nick.
<ctrlx> no, this is patrick
<SuperBrony64> I see...
<SuperBrony64> Then in that case…is this the Krusty Krab?
<ctrlx> no, this is patrick!
<RobotPinkie> Twilight eating flower petals is so cute.
<ctrlx> :33
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: I liked that moment from The Ticket Master.
<SuperBrony64> But I would be doing the same too if I hadn't eaten all day
<Nat> 0Robot, link?
<RobotPinkie> Like SuperBrony64 said, it's in the episode "Ticket Master"
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDhJdGwPPx0 Go to 11:15
<SuperBrony64> I CAN'T DECIDE!
<RobotPinkie> In general in the whole episode, I can relate to her frustration
<Nat> 0D'awwww <3
<SuperBrony64> I love how Celestia gives her two tickets knowing she has five friends.
<ctrlx> trollestia
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah, if there was ever any doubt Celestia likes trolling...
<ctrlx> more tea?
<RobotPinkie> I like how Angel keeps Fluttershy in check, too :P
<SuperBrony64> In fact, I love how every problem in most episodes of the show can be resolved with just some common sense.
<SuperBrony64> But then again, where's the moral in that?
<ctrlx> they're learning valuable lessons!
<RobotPinkie> people don't always have common sense.
<ctrlx> actually, we all are o-o
<RobotPinkie> More people need to watch FiM, clearly!
<SuperBrony64> When you try to please everypony, you end up pleasing no-pony at all.
*ctrlx nods
<Nat> 0Double troll: Invite Twilight and friends to GGG, only giving her two tickets, knowing GGG is kinda terrible

<NewDCD> 9but we haven't had the chance to organize that yet

<TrollightSparkle> @SuperBrony I believe becoming a mod?
<SuperBrony64> There's a form?
<NewDCD> 9or you could show us some special talent of yours that could help the site somehow
<NewDCD> 9and we can consider adding you into our staff
<NewDCD> 9for modding, there is
<SuperBrony64> I do like modding.
<NewDCD> 9for streaming S2/graphic design department/other logistics, there isn't

*VioletVanilla hugs Nat~ :3
<VioletVanilla> 6The premiere will air 9AM EST actually everypony.
<Nat> 0^.^
<Nat> 0Shame I'm going to bed so soon. :<
<TrollightSparkle> Are you really? :c
<Nat> 0Yeah. 5.5~ hours of sleep isn't that great anyway
<ctrlx> 3 is fine
<TrollightSparkle> But that's what coffee is for :P
<ctrlx> ^
<VioletVanilla> 6I only get about 2 if I get to bed here soon. . .
<ctrlx> VioletVanilla, it'll be easier to stay up
<Nat> 0Coffee doesn't actually help...
<TrollightSparkle> I would say take little naps throughout the day then.
<ctrlx> one powernap
<TrollightSparkle> You don't know the wonders a 30-45 minute nap has on your mind.
<ctrlx> more than one and you would start to crave sleep more
<TrollightSparkle> ^
<ctrlx> yesterday i worked a 12h shift after 24h no sleep
<ctrlx> energy driiiiinks~
<TrollightSparkle> Lawl, I have never drunk an energy drink in my life.
*VioletVanilla does not drink these energy drinks, and she is working nine hours.
<VioletVanilla> 6Good for you Trollight, they can help at times, but also can be just as bad.
<ctrlx> VioletVanilla, just keep your mind going on something. stay active. drink....whatever will help you stay awake.
<ctrlx> and you can crash when you get home :D
<ctrlx> i'm so bad to my body
<TrollightSparkle> I usually listen to heavy heavy metal stuff like Five Finger Death Punch to stay awake, if needed.
<Charles> Rain``?
<ctrlx> smoking, energydrinks/soda, not eating half the time, lack of sleep, and other little things
<Nat> 0Force of will is all I have, really. That and movement.
<Nat> 0... eeh.
<ctrlx> i haven't drank alcohol in forever though.
<TrollightSparkle> Know what's fun? Spinning in one of those spinny chairs :3
<ctrlx> i'm behind on my quota....
<Rain``> hmm?
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, i do that at work all the time
*Nat 0hugs VioletVanilla before gathering some blankets and plopping down haphazardly in them
<ctrlx> or do wheelchair wheelies around the halls
<Charles> ah, sooooo that's where you have been hiding, in plain sight all along
<TrollightSparkle> Lol, i wish I had a desk job to be able to do that at times.. or a job in itself -_-
<ctrlx> i work at a nursing home answering phones / watching the doors
<Kitten> lol
<ctrlx> but i also do bitch office work and IT stuff
<Charles> nice to know you still visit
<ctrlx> but in the evening i do have quite a bit of downtime so i can dick around
<Kitten> of course i do
<Charles> :D so what's up with you tonight?
<NewDCD> 9>Trixie's favorite pony

<TrollightSparkle> Nah, don't feel like risking cracking my head open :/
<ctrlx> and when they ask you for your qualifications, just be like, I CAN DO THIS *wheelie*
<ctrlx> TrollightSparkle, i've only fallen once
<TrollightSparkle> I always listened to my music when I worked in a grocery store, my superiors didn't complain.
<TrollightSparkle> But then again, I did go back in the wet coolers and reconsolidate everything :P
