<twilight_sprinkle> dat sciance
<Phase4> 00,02my brains failing
<Phase4> 00,02getting a little late here
<Phase4> 00,02Ankano_BrOnyxia, thats e as in the 'natural number' or something liek that
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah, I was going to head off to bed soon too
<Phase4> 00,02its a constant
<Phase4> 00,02base for natural logs
<twilight_sprinkle> e is one asesome number
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<twilight_sprinkle> *awesome
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Phase4: hmm ye i remember that.. but dunno.. i know log but not ln.. is it the same thing?
<Phase4> 00,02so the major axis
<Phase4> 00,02of a circle
<Phase4> 00,02is its radius
<Phase4> 00,02THANK YOU WIKIPEDIA
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> fur ellipse
<Phase4> 00,02for not telling me that
*AdamTheDuck hopes his secondary school mind (which is in holiday mode) can cope with this much maths :<
<Phase4> 00,02fortunately the wiki has the gravitational parameters listed
<Phase4> 00,02sp Pi(sqrt((r1+r2)^3 /8u))
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> me jelly
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> :D
<Sylandest> ...buck trying to understand that
<AdamTheDuck> I totally know what is happening in that equation >_>
<AdamTheDuck> Is that Applejack face? I can't remember.
<Sylandest> AdamTheDuck: yes
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh steampunk MLP music :3
<Princess_Cadence> morning everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Morning Princess_Cadence
<Sylandest> morning, prince-dari
<Sylandest> er
<Sylandest> Princess_Cadence:
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> its just square root but many shitz inside
<Phase4> 00,021.167922e9
<Phase4> 00,02big numbers
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> e?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> oh god lol
<Phase4> 00,02*10^9
<AdamTheDuck> Damn an e, shit just got real
<Phase4> 00,02'e' meens 'engineering'
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ye derp
<Phase4> 00,02in that context anyway
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> derp
<Gold_Demona> I think my brother in-law would love this game. He's a HUGE NASA geek and he loves math.
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: e as an exponent stands for engineering?
<Phase4> 00,0265793583872.75537370697625404685 seconds
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, it doesnt have a matmatic meening in that context
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> nowadays ppl only like games with shooting and such things though
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, i wasnt looking, nvm :P
<Phase4> 00,02it meens its an engineering value
<Phase4> 00,02the number before multiplyed by 10 to the power of the number after
<AdamTheDuck> Ankano_BrOnyxia, lieeees, I like games with a good story :3
<AdamTheDuck> Try "The Path" for example :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i know it means 10^x, i just didnt know it standed for engineering
<Phase4> 00,02ok that number is wrong
<Phase4> 00,02way to many seconds
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, ah
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> AdamTheDuck: well most ppl.
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> :P
<Phase4> 00,02other people here want to know about rugby for some reason
<twilight_sprinkle> rugby is math!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03who sings this song?
<Phase4> 00,02cant imagine why people want to know about rugby
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Phase4: so ex 2,354e6 would be 2,356 * 10^6?
<Phase4> 00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPqsl3SDUr0&feature=BFa&list=PL1A1A787F29F8790C
<Phase4> 00,02mandopony
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> 354*
<Phase4> 00,02Ankano_BrOnyxia, yup
<AdamTheDuck> Had a feeling it was mando
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> a cool
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> i could make a good mlp song i think.. if only i had more time
<Ulthane> guys, sorry to interrupt, what's the correct movie category for Blues Brothers? A or B?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> do movies have a correct category? idk :O
<Phase4> 00,02these numbers are too big
<Phase4> 00,02why are they too big
<Ulthane> Ankano_BrOnyxia in the lottery i mean
<AdamTheDuck> A different number from last result? :<
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, same number
<Phase4> 00,02infact i forgot to multiply by pi so its smaller than it "should" be
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Ulthane: i know. but do we need to categorize the movies or just put one to A and the other one to B
<AdamTheDuck> The lovable 3.14
<Phase4> 00,02it says its gona take 2392322 days to do an orbital transfer
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> pi is π
<AdamTheDuck> Ankano_BrOnyxia, categorise actually
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> π is a letter of my language
<twilight_sprinkle> п
<Ulthane> yes, the correct category is important
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> oh ic
<twilight_sprinkle> Ankano_BrOnyxia: what language, if not secret?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ok ask phase coz i wanna put 2 movies
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> twilight_sprinkle: Greek :p
<AdamTheDuck> Check the FAQ's
<twilight_sprinkle> Ankano_BrOnyxia: ah, cool
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> thx :3
<Bronysith> welp time for me to start NGE
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit, maybe listening to mlp ost while playing skyrim wasnt such a good idea, now i keep imagining skyrim when i hear the pet song
<Bronysith> d
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, Neon Gensis Evangelion? :3
<AdamTheDuck> Genesis*
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: yup
<AdamTheDuck> Awwwwwsome
<AdamTheDuck> Prepare your mind to get fucked
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Good series. Very confusing. But good.
<twilight_sprinkle> is that the one with oceans of blood?
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i know it is very fucking popular in japan
<Bronysith> NO SPOILERS
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, eeyup
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: its not a spoiler
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: It's pretty popular in the anime circles, too. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: its from ep 1
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i know they have Evangelion land in japan
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> Thank you!Your survey responses have been recorded.
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> ok
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Bronysith> does this bug you does this bug you does this bug you does this bug you
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> 999
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: dark souls is a skyrim ripoff. does this bug you?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> 999
<Bronysith> the NGE one shot for charity was hilarious
<Phase4> 00,02this is wrong
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> brbrbr
<Phase4> 00,02this equation is quite simply wrong
<AdamTheDuck> Steampunk again yay
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> aeiou?
<JRP2234> Phase4 im dying my hair green to match my oc mane
<AdamTheDuck> John Madden
<Sylandest> Phase4: then correct it, methinks?
<Phase4> 00,02Sylandest, problem is i dont know the correct equation
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, even though people claim to have seen it, i never actually witnessed wikipedia being wrong
<Phase4> 00,02and dont know enough to derive it myself
<Bronysith> episode 1
<Bronysith> angel attacks
<Sylandest> Phase4: hmm...got me, hehe. I can't even decipher half of this. Maybe try working it from the basics of the equation?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: are you trying to calculate something time-related for the interception of two orbits?
<JRP2234> guys i will dye my hair green to match my oc mane
<Phase4> 00,02Sylandest, the basics are normal orbital motion
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know how to go from that to time, and too tired to figure it
<Bronysith> man i want a giant fighting robot
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, yeah
<Sylandest> ...buck it, I got nothing then, Phase4 :D
<Bronysith> preferrable a lagann
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, i need to know how long the transfer will take, so i can time my launch
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> dix
<Phase4> 00,02this requires further study
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: altho i dont know much about orbital motion, if you can find the formula for period of rotation along elliptical orbits, you could try to derive from that
<Phase4> 00,02for now i will try land on the purple planet
<AdamTheDuck> ^ To the Phaselab! *Batman outtro music*
<Bronysith> Phase4: thats where i live...
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, thats... actually a good idea
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: nanananana Phase4 !
<Phase4> 00,02i should have thought of that
*Phase4 00,02blames tiredness
*twilight_sprinkle hugs Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs twilight_sprinkle back
<Phase4> 00,02it would actually be that simple yeah
*Bronysith glomps Phase4 into a ship
<AdamTheDuck> Yay it's now Saturday morning
<Phase4> 00,02half the orbital period of the eliptic orbit
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, Nuuuu, not into one of my ships!
<Phase4> 00,02you've doomed us both!
<twilight_sprinkle> idk if half, youd have to pick a position yourself and calculate for that, and launch accordingly
<Bronysith> why is this giant fucker called an Angel?
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, many interpretations, I can meddle into it if you wish
<AdamTheDuck> although spoilers
<Bronysith> ill see for myself
<AdamTheDuck> I suggest you watch the whole thing then ask questions Bronysith
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: how long is NGE?
<Bronysith> only 26 episodes
<twilight_sprinkle> hm
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe i should watch it
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, umm 26 or 28 episodes long
<twilight_sprinkle> k
<AdamTheDuck> I think like 20 minutes an episode
<twilight_sprinkle> i liked the movies i saw
<twilight_sprinkle> maybe ill check out the series too
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, Rebuild of Evangelion or End of Evangelion?
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> fur ellipse
<Bronysith> u starting?
<Bronysith> oy stop startin
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: idk, i think it was the three parter where the kid (shinji i think) went nuts at the end f the second one and caused the third impact
<AdamTheDuck> ^ SPIOLERS
<AdamTheDuck> DON'T READ
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah sorry
<twilight_sprinkle> but its the movie tho
<twilight_sprinkle> not the series
<Phase4> 00,02rainbow factory feels apropriate for this misson
<twilight_sprinkle> i like how purple that planet is
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> i would dl this game but dk
<twilight_sprinkle> reminds me of milka
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, pfft, waltz version is so much awesomer
<twilight_sprinkle> thats totally the Milka planet!
<Phase4> 00,02the oceans disapeared
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, still, movie is a remake and keeps parts of the original series
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: ok, sorry, i forgot about spoilers, i just didnt remember the name
<AdamTheDuck> Don't worry about it.
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: i hope bronysith didnt read it, or i'll feel bad :(
<Bronysith> i shall set all the fakes on fire
<Phase4> 00,02uh oh
<Phase4> 00,02lost my chute
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> wat was it about
<Gold_Demona> uh oh
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Well shit
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: so yeah dont read that message, that was spoilers
<Sylandest> Phase4: dis gun be good. cue the stock footage of the Kerbals back in the Mission room
<Phase4> 00,02this atmosphere is very dense
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i already called in an airstrike on your location
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: so youre saying theat the movies have the same story as the series NGE?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ok, i deserve it :'(
<Phase4> 00,02jebs not coming home from this one
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, the first movie was pretty much the first few episodes abridged
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: as i die an a fiery explosion, know, that i still love you...
<Sylandest> Phase4: NOOOOOO, not jeb!
<Ankano_BrOnyxia> i g2g bye everypony
<Gold_Demona> Oh noooo, Jeb! D:
<Sylandest> laters, Ankano_BrOnyxia
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, but the second has a similar story, does touch some parts of the original but is very different at the end
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ankano_BrOnyxia
<Phase4> 00,02using the radar
<Bronysith> NYAH i want a giant robot
<Phase4> 00,02theres the groind
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, what part are you up to?
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: i thought it was a three-parter tho. which one am i talking about?
<mentallyeffedguy> hey guys!
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, third movie is coming out sometime this year
<AdamTheDuck> Hello mentallyeffedguy
<AdamTheDuck> Or it might be out now, I haven't checked in a while
<Sylandest> he lived!
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: oh cool, i liked the previou stwo movies, whats the third one called?
<AdamTheDuck> Haha, he lives
<Sylandest> yesh!
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Phase4> 00,02gravity is higher than kerbin
<Nyst> Heavy gravity
<mentallyeffedguy> xboc live trolling
<Nyst> That's going to make return missions challenging.
<Sylandest> Phase4: perhaps thats why we lost the chute before? stronger gravity pull from the planet?
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo coming November 17
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: ah cool, thanks
<Phase4> 00,02Sylandest, probably
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Wow. That's an ironic name.
<Phase4> 00,02this lander was designed for mun landings
<Phase4> 00,02getting it from eve orbit to landing isnt easy
<Sylandest> then we need a stronger lander...or something
<Phase4> 00,02would not have made it without the chute
<Gold_Demona> Instruments going nuts there
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: its realizing Phase is still piloting
<Phase4> 00,02Sylandest, thats what my new landers for, has chutes for landing on planets with atmosphere
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Nyst> Shouldn't the thick atmosphere help you slowing down though?
<Phase4> 00,02have fun there jeb
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, only if you have a chute
<Sylandest> Nyst: thick atmosphere, maybe, but higher gravity is stronger
<mentallyeffedguy> gmod?
<Phase4> 00,02otherwise it just makes your rockets less efficent
<Nyst> At least it's not a high gravity planet without an athmosphere.
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<Nyst> *atmosphere
<Sylandest> Nyst: we'd be dead then :D or jeb would be
<mentallyeffedguy> derpy`s eyes are normal <-<
<Nyst> Derpy's eyes are normal lots of times.
<mentallyeffedguy> naaaaat goooooood
<Nyst> Their rotation means that every so often they'll end up normal.
<Phase4> 00,02a real chalenge would be landing on jool
<mentallyeffedguy> no shit
<Nyst> Jool?
<Nyst> That one of the new planets?
<Phase4> 00,02yup
<Sylandest> well, now we know where to send Phase4 - I mean Jeb, next
<Nyst> I have to say that they're not the names I expected, but they're still good.
<Phase4> 00,02its 10 times kerbin in diameter
<Sylandest> bejeesus, thats massive
<Phase4> 00,02it is
<Nyst> ...is that a gas planet?
<Phase4> 00,02i fell to it earlier today
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, no, has a surface
<Nyst> Oh.
<Phase4> 00,02got to like 40KM off the surface
<Nyst> For a moment there I thought it was.
<Phase4> 00,02and the capsule, JUST the capsule, had slowed to 20m/s
<Nyst> Big gravity well?
<Phase4> 00,02chute snapped off ages before
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, huge
<Nyst> ...you know what this means right?
<Nyst> Slingshotting!
<Sylandest> lol, Nyst
<Sylandest> we'd be sending Jeb into oblivion
<Sylandest> see, he's already terrified of the idea
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if i can land on one of the moons
<Princess_Cadence> can sombody pass me the link for the cundom star music video thats always played here please
<Phase4> 00,02orton is fraid of space
<Princess_Cadence> *gundom
<Sylandest> oh, his name is Orton? my mistake
<Phase4> 00,02Princess_Cadence, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
<twilight_sprinkle> Princess_Cadence: you mean the gundam gaygnam style?
<twilight_sprinkle> nvm
<Phase4> 00,02or you meen the gundam one
<Princess_Cadence> thank you
<Princess_Cadence> yes
<Phase4> 00,02Princess_Cadence, the remix of that one or that one?
<Phase4> 00,02i dont have the remix
<Princess_Cadence> yes
<twilight_sprinkle> ok, so this is my 2nd time seeing something about gangam today
<Princess_Cadence> aww x
<Princess_Cadence> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> ill see it at least once more on bmn
<Ethereal> Greetings, all :D
<twilight_sprinkle> so thats about my 15th time seeing something gayngam-related in the last three days
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ethereal
<Bronysith> dat NGE opening song
<Phase4> 00,02landing on tylo it seems
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Ethereal
<AdamTheDuck> Bronysith, sotto furro mono :P
<Phase4> 00,02max time warp
<Phase4> 00,02still takes ages
<twilight_sprinkle> Bayonetta ost...goddamn it is made of so much awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> weeeeee
<AdamTheDuck> or was it furero? >.<
<Bronysith> final fantasy always has awesome music
<AdamTheDuck> Bitch please, Digimon ost FTW :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: well one-winged angel and that song were great, but i think bayonetta might be a tiny bit better
<Bronysith> Final fantasy was on the NES SNES PS1, and PS2
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: *that song you linked
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: oh, final fantasy 8 opening theme
<twilight_sprinkle> yah
<Kandarihu|OldComp> PS3 too
<MadSurge> Extended version! :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: one sec imma link you the bayonetta one
<Kandarihu|OldComp> <twilight_sprinkle> so thats about my 15th time seeing something gayngam-related in the last three days <- you're going to hear it on the stream after or even DURING BMN
<Bronysith> Kandarihu|OldComp: nope
<Phase4> 00,02this will take a while
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|OldComp: yeah, i said that earlier
<Bronysith> Kandarihu|OldComp: there are only 10 final fantasies
<Phase4> 00,02super efficent, super slow atomic engines
<Meanwhile> This will take a thousand years.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Bronysith, FFXIII is on the PS3, right?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|OldComp: [10:17:52] <twilight_sprinkle> ill see it at least once more on bmn :P
<Bronysith> Kandarihu|OldComp: there are only 10 final fantasies
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|OldComp: 10:17:52] <twilight_sprinkle> ill see it at least once more on bmn
<Meanwhile> By the time you arrive a whole new propulsion system will have been invented and beaten you to it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|OldComp: hmm, its not copying the time i said it
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|OldComp: point is, im sick of it <.<
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Ah, so we're invoking discontinuity then?
<Meanwhile> Fraaaaaaaaaaance.
<Phase4> 00,02you can see the other moons from here
<Bronysith> dat Meanwhile
<mentallyeffedguy> what are we watching?
<Meanwhile> Why is Quasimodo singing?
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: phase4 conquering the galaxy
<Phase4> 00,02well the solar system
<AdamTheDuck> mentallyeffedguy, Phase torturing a poor Kerbal soul in space
<Phase4> 00,02only thing in the galaxy right now
<mentallyeffedguy> cool, what is it about?
<Meanwhile> Baby steps Phase.
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, indeed
<Bronysith> chat lacks Hellfire
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Yeah. The Kerbin system is the entire galaxy, right?
<Bronysith> and reboot
<Phase4> 00,02this thing gets a delta-v of like 1500 per row of tank
<Bronysith> reboot is friggin awesomeness
<Meanwhile> Today the solar system, tomorrow the universe!
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, : D
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: basically the game is a simulation of rocket stuff
<Meanwhile> A Fiiiiiiiiirewaaaaaaaaaall.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> And all those other things in the background are all nearby galaxies?
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello everyone :)
<Phase4> 00,02out of fuel in that stage
<mentallyeffedguy> simulation of rocket stuff..... sounds less cool now.
<Sylandest> howdy MLP_Brovakiin
<AdamTheDuck> Hello MLP_Brovakiin
<Kandarihu|OldComp> mentallyeffedguy, it's amusing when he does silly designs that can't make it into space. And he's done that enough that seeing him actually go back into space is a nice change of pace.
<mentallyeffedguy> Kandarihu|OldComp: sounds more interesting now.
*doughnutjoe sigh
<doughnutjoe> can't sleep
<doughnutjoe> again
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 really high mountians
<AdamTheDuck> Confound these ponies?
<Phase4> 00,02those mountians look quite high
<mentallyeffedguy> doughnutjoe: it is 16:27 here, what about there?
<doughnutjoe> lemme check
<Ethereal> Anyone here on Steam?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> doughnutjoe:
<ModernSuperMASF123U> You here?
<Phase4> 00,02think i'm gona crash
<ModernSuperMASF123U> How old are you?
<Phase4> 00,02this thing has a lot of gravity
<Meanwhile> Damn you Newton.
<doughnutjoe> 12:28 AM
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, running ouy of fuel too fast
<mentallyeffedguy> nighty night to you doughnutjoe !
<doughnutjoe> ModernSuperMASF123U lol
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02i might just
<doughnutjoe> ModernSuperMASF123U yeah
<doughnutjoe> i got kicked XD
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<doughnutjoe> and banned.....
<Phase4> 00,02eyup
<Phase4> 00,02too much gravity
<Meanwhile> Dat music timing.
<AdamTheDuck> Kerbal jetpack ftw~
<AdamTheDuck> annnnd ded
<Phase4> 00,02i think this thing is bigger than kerbin
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Meanwhile> Erryday ahm kerbin
<Phase4> 00,02http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/Tylo lol
<Phase4> 00,02no info
<HoodyNinja|School> Hello bronystate
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya HoodyNinja|School
<HoodyNinja|School> My computer is broken :(
<Phase4> 00,02ohai HoodyNinja|School
<AdamTheDuck> Hello HoodyNinja|School
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Well, switching back
<Phase4> 00,02good thing it wasnt jool
<twilight_sprinkle> heehee, dat wolfram alpha, gotta love that site....
<Phase4> 00,02jool doesnt kill you
<Phase4> 00,02it just holds you in its atmosphere
<MadSurge> Good thing you don't need math to play Kerbal Space Program, right?
<Phase4> 00,02forever
<AdamTheDuck> Forever?!?! :<
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, uhhhhhhhhh
<HoodyNinja|School> Good thing fire burns
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, you dont NEED math
<Phase4> 00,02but i'ma use it anyway
<Phase4> 00,02goddamnit wolfram is down
<twilight_sprinkle> math makes everything better
<Meanwhile> I hate math.
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02i wonder
<HoodyNinja|School> math makes teh world go round
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: wolfram works for me
<HoodyNinja|School> Don't have to like it
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, down here
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: me too buddy :D
<Phase4> 00,02HoodyNinja|School, i like it :(
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, MadSurge: D:
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, it's up for me
<Phase4> 00,02you guys are just jelly you cant math together rockets
<HoodyNinja|School> math is meh
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: ^
<Phase4> 00,02firefox seems to have died
<Kammerjunk> Math is fun.
<Meanwhile> U mad Phase?
<Kammerjunk> Especially algebra.
<HoodyNinja|School> NO NOT TEH FIREFOX
<doughnutjoe> meh
<doughnutjoe> ima go
<doughnutjoe> bye guys
<AdamTheDuck> Night doughnutjoe
<Meanwhile> And nothing of value was lost.
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, i am but for completely unrelated reasons >_>
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, doughnutjoe.
*HoodyNinja|School fires doughnutjoe out the goodbye cannon
<MadSurge> Phase4: I'm just not cut for math, ok? I always prefered literature :D
<twilight_sprinkle> i enjoyed algebra and trig a lot, but calculus turned out to be even more fun. except the trigonometric integrals, those are a b*tch <.<
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, fair enough
<Phase4> 00,02but math is much more powerfull than it seems
<HoodyNinja|School> twilight_sprinkle: NERD!
<Meanwhile> I preferred playing poker behind upright books.
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: nerds make the world go round
<MadSurge> No doubt Phase4
<HoodyNinja|School> twilight_sprinkle: No, gravity does
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: it seems very powerful as it is o.o
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: In this time and day, though, the school gives computers to all the students. So yeah, poker.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> So tired.
<Phase4> 00,02wolfram is still down here
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: actually nerds do, but thats a secret, dont tell anyone
<Kammerjunk> I don't even play poker, to be honest.
<HoodyNinja|School> dat rocket
<ModernSuperMASF123U> But so depressed.
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: try this http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Soneone help me!
<ModernSuperMASF123U> D:
<ModernSuperMASF123U> :'(
<HoodyNinja|School> twilight_sprinkle: If its a secret, then why are you saying this in manechat?
<Kammerjunk> Hah, no.
<Kammerjunk> I mean.
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Poker games were where half my lunch money came from.
<Kammerjunk> Sure, what's the matter?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> I'm sorry guys. :/
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: cause sometimes secrets are exposed
*HoodyNinja|School puts twilight_sprinkle in the nerd bucket
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Phase4> 00,02still down
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm
<twilight_sprinkle> well that sucks
<twilight_sprinkle> wolfram ftw
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, works for me.
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: am i a lyra then?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kammerjunk: me too
<HoodyNinja|School> twilight_sprinkle: You can't breath water
<HoodyNinja|School> so no
<Phase4> 00,02must be an online calc
<Phase4> 00,02there we go http://www.calctool.org/CALC/phys/astronomy/planet_orbit
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: are you using college internet? if so, it might not be allowed
<Phase4> 00,02oh nvm
<Phase4> 00,02that ones useless
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, home internet
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: i can actually
<HoodyNinja|School> Do it
<AdamTheDuck> So much maths at this ungodly hour... :D
<AdamTheDuck> D: *
<XylemTube> SCIENCE
<HoodyNinja|School> I have direct tv, an xbox, a ps3, and a garage full of sports equipment, and i'm still bored without my computer :|
<Meanwhile> And to think by now he probably could've just crashed a wild guess into the moon.
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmmmm
<HoodyNinja|School> He has the funds
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm heading to sleep now, goodnight everyone. :)
<Meanwhile> Night AdamTheDuck.
<HoodyNinja|School> he could if he wanted too
<AdamTheDuck> Have fun with your maths Phase4 :P
<HoodyNinja|School> night AdamTheDuck
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, i will
<Phase4> 00,02night
<Eli> howdy guys
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Eli
<HoodyNinja|School> Eli: I'm not on fire >_>
<Princess_Cadence> hiya Eli
<Kammerjunk> Yes, you are.
*Kammerjunk throws a campfire at HoodyNinja|School.
<HoodyNinja|School> Damn! *jumps out window*
*Eli throws a bucket of full of water at HoodyNinja|School
*HoodyNinja|School takes his shirt off
<Phase4> 00,02STUPID THING
<HoodyNinja|School> :'(
<Phase4> 00,02i got the same number as the other equation
<Phase4> 00,02which is a: cool, meens i probably figured it right
<Phase4> 00,02b: sucks cause this cant work in kerbal physics
*Maid_RainBow takes of the miad outfit and runs around naked
<Meanwhile> Yaaaaaaaaay.
*HoodyNinja|School puts Maid_RainBow in the same bucket as twilight_sprinkle
<MLP_Brovakiin> Maid_RainBow: :D
<Phase4> 00,02DEEEEERRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP
<Phase4> 00,02the standard gravitational parameter wants meters
<HoodyNinja|School> derp so loud
<Phase4> 00,02the parameter suplied by the ksp wiki is kilometers
<Eli> Phase4: sooo X1000?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: reverse
<Phase4> 00,02Eli, nope
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: depends what number you take
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: well actually no youre right
<HoodyNinja|School> Divide by 1000
<Phase4> 00,02more than that
<Phase4> 00,02its MK^2/S^2
<Phase4> 00,02KM'
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: it does depend on what you take, but i think its x1000
<twilight_sprinkle> the full formula is that yeah
<HoodyNinja|School> I think :p
<Phase4> 00,02actually yeah maybe its just X1000
<HoodyNinja|School> IDk this im in english right now
<Phase4> 00,02because the number i've got is still useless
<Phase4> 00,0275651.871100341104419435618804001 days
<HoodyNinja|School> thats what, 250 years?
<Gold_Demona> Wow
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: way more
<HoodyNinja|School> twilight_sprinkle: actually i think i was over
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: nvm
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: im half afk so i misread
*HoodyNinja|School takes twilight_sprinkle out of the nerd bucket
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja|School: aw, i liked the bucket...
<HoodyNinja|School> Mabye I could nab a laptop from school...
<twilight_sprinkle> dat binary
<Nyst> Wilhelm scream
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> that is awesome
<Bronysith> you are all welcome
<Gold_Demona> LOL Sweetiebot
<HoodyNinja|School> shit, I gotta go, next class starts. Later guys
<Phase4> 00,02"Sweetie belle wants to congratulate you on your skills of reading binary. Hopefully one day we will be able to take over the filthy pony race and let robots take their rightful place in Equestria"
<Lil_B> bye HoodyNinja|School
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<twilight_sprinkle> bye HoodyNinja|School
<Phase4> 00,02the ksp fourms are down
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma just tf2 for a bit then sleep
<Bronysith> now for episode 3 of NGE
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: DUMBLEDORE DIES <_<
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: now you shall as well
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: im still dead from the last time you killed me, you cant kill me again
*Bronysith pulls out a ghostbusters vacuum
<Phase4> 00,02youtubes been doing that
<Phase4> 00,02fullscreen inexplicably breaks
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i would think you would intercept the other orbit eventually in almost any case, unles the perios are in such a way that ti doesnt, but theres only 1 narrow case for that
<Nyst> Same here.
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, the problem with that is the ammount of time it takes
<Phase4> 00,02at full time warp, a single orbit still takes a few minutes
<Phase4> 00,02server has downloads
<Eli> I just tried to check out the wikipedia site about binary... they suck at explaining it :(
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: that long huh, that is kinda bad
<Phase4> 00,02Eli, base 2 number system
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i can try to explain it
<twilight_sprinkle> or phase
<Eli> Phase4: i know binary :)
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hOcc5DpzIs&feature=autoplay&list=PL1A1A787F29F8790C&playnext=1 << have an unlisted youtube vid
<MadSurge> DAT TWILIGHT PICTURE :D
<Ninjazz> Is stream up?
<Eli> Phase4: i just wanted to know how you "read" binary. i mean, i know how to read it, but only numbers, not like A B C
<MadSurge> hello Ninjazz! Yes it is
<Phase4> 00,02Eli, ascii
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony! :)
<Ninjazz> Then no posting youtube links, Phase. :T

<Ninjazz> Compromise?
<Eli> towering pile of texas hats?
<MadSurge> ...wait, how you can HATE being the boss?!
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, easy, when the boss sucks
<MadSurge> Phase4: which bosses suck? :D

<Eli> Princess_Cadence: i see the same things as you, so either, we're both equally carzy, or that applebloom is actually there
<MadSurge> Hello Pearly!
<Eli> i'm guessing crazy
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Pearly
<Phase4> 00,02why is my game lagging so much
<Pearly> hey MadSurge and Gold_Demona how are you dears doin'?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: cause background music, stream, browser, skype?:P

<MadSurge> Ewww, one of the melee weapons is a Spy's arm? D:
<BladedWings> eeyup
<RaveBrony> Yep
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 I think they should use that model on the PF2 hero server for Pinkie on Halloween.
<MadSurge> :D
<DashWithRainbows> Looks much better than the creepy looking Mane 6 heroes.
<MadSurge> GO PINKIE
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: apparently the skins are getting much better
<MadSurge> Who's the boss?
<BladedWings> big mac
<MadSurge> So many bosses :D
<Sheep> hi cades^^
<Cades> hey
<Cades> whats up
<MadSurge> Celestia?
<DashWithRainbows> Phase, do you mind sending me the IP for this server so I can play it when PF2 hero is lacking players?
<Sheep> I'm fiddling with a Spyro game I started making some time ago. Trying to make some progress on it.
<Kinixys> Yeah I wouldn't mind trying this server.
<Cades> cool :D
<Malk> hello
<Kinixys> hi
<Sheep> It's a 2d platformer. And I'm trying to make it simple, in hope that I don't get stuck with difficulties like with more complex game projects:P
<MadSurge> Hi Malk!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Malk
<MadSurge> Gotta take my bro to the station
<MadSurge> Train station, brb
<Malk> Havent been here in a few days
<Cades> You program games?
<Sheep> yes
<Cades> thats cool
<Sheep> Or... I try to make games, but it becomes only partial game engines or things that could be used in games. I haven't made many completed games.
<Cades> oh lol
<Malk> Im in hospital they have wifi
<Maid_RainBow> Malk :what happend?
<Cades> I tried programming once, and I liked it for a bit, but it eventually got kinda boring. Maybe I should give it another chance :p
<Sheep> I think it is a lot of fun, though can be very difficult or frustrating to solve bugs:P
<Cades> yeah haha
<incog> yes, hello
<Phase4> 00,02WHY IS SO SILENT
<Eli> we ded
<Master-Derps> yh
<LightTrooper105> im back o.o
<Master-Derps> and hi all
<DashWithRainbows> I don't know Phase4, maybe the kids are in school?
<Gold_Demona> ded
<Master-Derps> kool im joining this XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> One of the guys ob that server sound like tourettes guy.
<Eli> hi Master-Derps
<Phase4> 00,02" incog has quit (K-Lined)" ololololo
<Phase4> 00,02K-Line meens banned from the network
<Gold_Demona> I was undead this morning. Now I'm just ded. :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> wait. wut Phase4 ?
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Barbetos|AtWork> On the ponychat network?
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos|AtWork, incog was baned from ponychat
<Ninjazz> He keeps coming back though.
<Phase4> 00,02he does
<Barbetos|AtWork> looooolll
<Phase4> 00,02and keeps getting klined
<Ninjazz> That's the second time I've seen him klined.
<Maid_RainBow> what happend?
<Phase4> 00,02third time i've seen it
<Gold_Demona> What does he do?
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, not a clue
<Phase4> 00,02but its probably less than nice
<Ninjazz> He has like 30 chans up.
<Barbetos|AtWork> probably the one who breaks da rules
<Master-Derps> the download takes 4ever to join this server
<Master-Derps> XD
<Sheep> afk
<Ninjazz> I /think/ it's for phishing.
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Ninjazz> I think.
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back...........
<Master-Derps> goomba stomp im so gonna go scout now
<Dark92Enigma> Hi Kurra!
<Eli> later
<Barbetos|AtWork> Probably. That would get a network ban real quick, and it would make sense with all the warnings about "don't click stranger links"
<Master-Derps> w b Dark92Enigma
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hm. I need to get that RD model for my copy of tf2.
<Ninjazz> I've seen someone /try/ to phish attempt. k-lined always immediately.
<RaveBrony> Bufferrr
<RaveBrony> Oh, good
<Barbetos|AtWork> How does anyone even win this?
<Barbetos|AtWork> and vinyl looks really masculine.
<Master-Derps> kill hale which is atm vinyl
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai :)
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yeah i remember that one time and the so called bot or person actually got into a channel i ''mod'' and he sen't a message to my BF and all but i didn't know til the guy left but luckily my BF knew due to the message and all
<Master-Derps> hi maxTheBrony
<Dark92Enigma> who's ready for Movie Night?
<Barbetos|AtWork> ded
<Barbetos|AtWork> so ded
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Master-Derps :)
<MaxTheBrony> I dont know what the movies are , let me check :)
<Malk_> Im alive Barbetos
<Master-Derps> heya:$
<BladedWings> Dark92Enigma: i got class tonight so i wont be on till BMN is over :(
<Dark92Enigma> A request to anypony streaming the movies: Please......stream the NC review of the B movie: Space Jam
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, Hmmm. Similar experience.
<Master-Derps> still downloading modles and stuff....
<Phase4> 00,02i like this server
<MaxTheBrony> I dont know any of the movies
<Ninjazz> Also, dat "mod". :p
<Dark92Enigma> BladedWings: Oh, it's ok, there's always Euro Night
<Barbetos|AtWork> That would of ended a lot sooner with bunny hopping
<Dark92Enigma> MaxTheBrony: Galaxy Quest and SPACE JAM
<BladedWings> Dark92Enigma: true
<MaxTheBrony> never heard of them
<Cades> i probably gtg soon
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Dark92Enigma> MaxTheBrony: For pony episodes we got Birdle Gossip and Family Appreciation Day
<MaxTheBrony> nice :)
<Phase4> 00,02one excelent movie and one i cant remember
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yeah >.> but it was one of thoes days where the message popped up everywhere and i as i said the person or bot entered the channel but i didn't again realise till he left though he did no damage
<Dark92Enigma> MaxTheBrony: i haven't seen Galaxy Quest, so it's gonna be my 1st time i see it........as for Space Jam.....time to relive the Nostalgia
<MaxTheBrony> Woah i got like 15 secs delay on stream :s
<killerpony7733> MaxTheBrony This is what happens with messages streams and some others
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, funny the lengths some people would go just for kicks and giggles.
<Dark92Enigma> Request for anypony streaming the movies: stream NC's review of Space Jam, as a dedicatory to him
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yeah what point is there to try and lure someone into giving their IRC account here?
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Theres no actual value to them
<Dark92Enigma> brb, gonna pick up my lunch
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, the only thing I can think of is the e-mail or IP address. But other than that, it's just silly.
<Malk_> Hey Sergio_Scriptor
<MaxTheBrony> .
<MaxTheBrony> ded?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I think the red team is actually on a quest to give saxton a shirt and proper pants
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Else the worst we endure is the netsplits but that's about it trolls are just bad and all so nothing that makes a dent in anything
<Barbetos|AtWork> suddenly slow mo
<Barbetos|AtWork> trololol
<Barbetos|AtWork> follow dat medic
<Master-Derps> almost done downloading XD
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, netsplits and lag more so. I can just ignore "trolls" and bots. Takes a true troll to get me to /ignore or rustle my jimmies.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz It's even more fun to make a troll bored cause it shows how bad they are and you humiliate them too
<SafariMonkey> Hey guys
<BladedWings> hi SafariMonkey
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, meh. I get bored of them too easy too fast. Just tend to ignore instead.
<Master-Derps> hey SafariMo:)nkey
<Master-Derps> whoops
<Master-Derps> XD
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Usually do but that day i just really felt like it and i won
<Master-Derps> close enough
<SafariMonkey> Master-Derps: That *was* a pretty masterful derp. :P
<Master-Derps> yup
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, lol nice. Was this an actual troll or just a hater who thought he knew something we didn't?
<Master-Derps> meh i could never beat derpy so i changed my name from Master-derpy so Master-Derps XD
<Master-Derps> ʸᵃʸ i can join in a min :)
<SafariMonkey> Is this a mod?
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Troll in some way he had a very random way of asking stuff and all and it was directed at soft spots that usually is asked by a ''bad'' troll and he several times spammed cause he was getting bored but i eventually reported him and alot later he did it to someone else and he got banned
<Master-Derps> ʸᵃʸ im in
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, ah. So still had no class. Even got himself banned. "Nothing of value was lost".
<Cades> k cya
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yeppers but i still facepalm the most with those that just spout insults and worse yet generic insults you know a ahem ''bad bad bad'' troll would use
<Moopy> Morning everypony hows it going?
<Phase4> 00,02i got stuck on wall
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, I don't even give them the courtesy of being called a troll. Trolling truely is an art. If someone gets upset from petty insults, they're almost as bad as the person throwing them.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz True true :P
<BladedWings> morning moobull69
<BladedWings> tab fail i mean Moopy
<Moopy> Sup dude

<killerpony7733> Brace for ban!
<Nyst> So you spend a few minutes figuring out which is the better gun.
*Ninjazz puts on his ban cap.
<MASF123> Phase4 said to be on your best behavior. :(
<twilight_sprinkle> you get bans for rainbows? i hope its not too long
<Nyst> And then five minutes later repeat it again.
<twilight_sprinkle> but hey, at least i brought colors to this black-white chat. arent you happy?
<Nyst> That's a pretty sad rainbow. You could have color coordinated it.
<twilight_sprinkle> hmmm

<AJIsAwesome> USA. :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Lil_B: i started to hear a scarf :P i leave my house to catch the train at 06:30,and it's freaking 4 degrees celcius :(
<BladedWings> aaaaand im back
<puffmuffins> woah6_9
<Blako> it happens also on school website, which uses javascript havily
<Blako> so maybe javascript takes its focus
<Sergio_Scriptor> i live in a mountain so :P
<Lil_B> Sergio_Scriptor wow, it's not THAT cold here yet, although I will porbably start to free my cars windows in the next few weeks >.<
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, BladedWings :)
<Sylandest> afternoon, everypony! :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Sylandest :P
<BladedWings> hi AJIsAwesome and Sylandest
<Dragonmatte> Hellu everypony, nobody streaming? D:
<Lil_B> hia BladedWings and Sylandest and Dragonmatte
<Sergio_Scriptor> Lil_B: also i got an excuse cause i live on the side of a mountain,so of course it's cold XD
<Sylandest> howdy Sergio_Scriptor, BladedWings, Lil_B
<BladedWings> ohai Dragonmatte
<alexxm> how are things Sylandest
<Sylandest> alexxm: things are good! Just finished exams, now i can relax for awhile
<Alchemist> good evening guys!
<Lil_B> Sergio_Scriptor are you a tiberian monk in the Himalayas?
<Lil_B> hia Alchemist :)
<Dragonmatte> Someone should stream typing of the dead xD
<BladedWings> hi Alchemist
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Alchemist :)
<Dragonmatte> Hia Alchemist
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Alchemist
<alexxm> how are thingd Alchemist
<Sergio_Scriptor> Lil_B: :D nope...portuguese imigrant in the swiss alps :P
<Alchemist> Sylandest: finished exams? in september?
<Sylandest> Alchemist: tests, really. Not actual end of term exams :$
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Alchemist :P
<Lil_B> Sergio_Scriptor oh XD
<Alchemist> alexxm: great, thank you :)
<Alchemist> had a discussion with my project leader about our research and its gonna be awesome, though I will have to travel a lot
<Sergio_Scriptor> Alchemist: can you tell us what is it ? :P
<Lil_B> Alchemist yeah, would like to know that too :)
<Cades> maybe
<Alchemist> Sergio_Scriptor: its about the layer structure/properites of preadsorbed poly(ethyleneamine) on silica surface at given pHs if that explains anything :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Alchemist: dont worry i understand some of it XD
<Saturn> 08,01i have a pair of nuts in my mouth
<Lil_B> Alchemist kinda understandable XD
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: .............
<Lil_B> Sergio_Scriptor do you do something chemistry releated too?
<Lil_B> Saturn :|
<Saturn> 08,01one's a cashew, one's a pistachio
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Lil_B: i understand some basic chemistry :P but im more of an exeprt with history and a few Theoretical Physics theories and formulas :P
<Alchemist> point is, most people thought that when you adsorb a positively charged polymer onto an oppositely charged surface it would form a homogenous layer, but it turns out it does not and we are looking into that.
<Lil_B> Sergio_Scriptor I love histroy, but I'm lerning chemistry :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> Lil_B: cool :) good luck with that :P
<Lil_B> Alchemist can I ask you how old you are?
<Alchemist> Lil_B: 26
<Alchemist> Lil_B: But i only started uni 3 years ago
<Bronysith> geez that took forever
<Cades> does ur school use ff too?
<Lil_B> Alchemist hopefully I'll make it to an University too after this school year, if not.... most people from my current school got good jobs, it's a rather mercyless school XD
<Lil_B> or should I say Mercuryless school? ... Sorry, I guess that was my worst pun yet
<Alchemist> Lil_B: do you want to make it into an university?
<Blako> yes firefox
<Alchemist> Lil_B: because I think at some point you said that you would settle for a technical job.
<Lil_B> Alchemist yes, don't want to end up in a repeditive laboratory for the rest of my life, I would like to do research
<Alchemist> handling instruments and testing samples
<vcades13> thats amazing
<Blako> hi
<Blako> oh it is you :D
<Cades> yeah :p
<Lil_B> Alchemist yeah, currently I'm ... erm... (there isn't an actual english term for that) chemical technical assistand
<Cades> usually schools use ie
<Alchemist> dont worry i know what you are talking about :)
<Lil_B> + If I do well I get a collage dagree in the field of chemistry (and microbiology) and in these fields I'm able to study later
<ToasterRepairPony> Hi guys
<Alchemist> will you have to do an entry exam for the uni or just good grades/recommendation from you previous school?
<BladedWings> hi ToasterRepairPony
<ToasterRepairPony> Hey everypony!!
<Sergio_Scriptor> Hi ToasterRepairPony :)
<Blako> I think at basic school there was ie
<prince-dari> Just gunna test something guys
<ToasterRepairPony> My other name is Dasher
<ToasterRepairPony> I just finished fallout equestria
<ToasterRepairPony> long Fanfic
<alexxm> how are things ToasterRepairPony
<Cades> yeah maybe
<Lil_B> Alchemist good grades mostly, as far as I know most Universitys in germany don't do entry exams anymore, but they require really good grades sometimes
<Lil_B> hi ToasterRepairPony
<ToasterRepairPony> Pretty good just tired stayed up all night reading fanfics
<AJIsAwesome> Hi ToasterRepairPony
<Alchemist> Lil_B: oooh, microbiology is good. Pays well and it usually has hot topics, especially now.
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Blako> I think our school uses ff because it has only avast antivirus, so it will be safer
<ToasterRepairPony> I used to go by Dasher but since I finished F.E fanfic i decided to use this one
<BladedWings> working like you want it to dari?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Lil_B and Alchemist ,this will probably sound dumb but...why do you guys like to study and work at chemistry ? :P sorry to ask this,is that im more of a Astrophisics guy :P
<prince-dari> Not sure
<prince-dari> Probably not
<AJIsAwesome> Any of you guys have any tips for someone who is looking to master the Soldier in TF2
<AJIsAwesome> *?
<Cades> oh
<prince-dari> We'll see what happens when I try and run a game
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: yeah, read a book instead
<prince-dari> It'll probably die
<prince-dari> :P
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: :I
<ToasterRepairPony> Anyone now any good new fanfics
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: not realy,just learn how to rocket jump
<Saturn> 08,01ToasterRepairPony: plenty
<alexxm> what be this game
<ToasterRepairPony> God I hate Pony Pervs
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Okay.
<Saturn> 08,01ToasterRepairPony: cloppers?
<ToasterRepairPony> I need a long one no pun intended
<ToasterRepairPony> Yeah
<Alchemist> Sergio_Scriptor: originally I wanted to know what stuff we were made out of and what can they do.
<Saturn> 08,01ToasterRepairPony: so i take it you only want clean fics?
*Saturn 08,01closes the pm window
<ToasterRepairPony> I dont mind
<Sergio_Scriptor> Alchemist: interesting :)
<Dragonmatte> 1 fps xD
<Lil_B> Alchemist I don't actually know if I will be able to study in this field, but my school does enough Microbiology to allow us to work in these kind of jobs, I'm thinking about these too
<Saturn> 08,01fair enough
<ToasterRepairPony> Ive read plents of clopfics
<Blako> but there is some special mechanism that clears all hdds after some time and loads the OS and everything there frome some central hdd, which cannot be written to
<Sergio_Scriptor> ToasterRepairPony: you know,im a clopper :|
<ToasterRepairPony> F.E Has a few parts that are not for imature reading
<Blako> so they don't have to deal with viruses so much
<Alchemist> Sergio_Scriptor: nothing fancy really. Other thing that is important for me is that I actually contribute to something.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Screw this
<prince-dari> I'll set up to stream something good instead
<Lil_B> Alchemist I always liked Chemistry, to be totally honest, I would have rather done something wioth Computers, but there is just nothing like this here
<BladedWings> lol dari
<Lil_B> Alchemist sry, I ment Sergio_Scriptor XD
<Sergio_Scriptor> Alchemist: i feel the same thing about theoretical phisics :P i always have been so interested in the universe and how it works and what secrets it holds :) i never realy had that big interest in chemestry :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> Also thanks for sharing Lil_B :)
<Alchemist> Sergio_Scriptor: dont worry, most people dont care about chemistry.., I blame it mostly on poor middle school science classes.
<Lunac> Less then a month to go.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Alchemist: i know that feel :D
<Lil_B> Sergio_Scriptor Physics arew fun too, I even habe Stefen Hawkinds in my Bookshelf XD but after 1 year of Phsysics in the first year in the chemistry education I know that I will not go though there -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> physics are awshum
<Lunac> When will the series 3 episodes be streamed? The same day?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Lil_B: it can be boring i know :D you realy need to be fully dedicated to phisics in order to pulçl it out and not get bored to death :D just saying :P
<ToasterRepairPony> So anyone here read all of Fallout Equestria and Past sins
<Alchemist> Sergio_Scriptor: while we are at that, I dont know much about astrophysics except from what I saw in some Neil DeGrasse Tyson/Michio Kaku/Lawrence Krauss videos on youtube :D
<ToasterRepairPony> ?So anyone here read all of Fallout Equestria and Past sins
<Sergio_Scriptor> Alchemist: maybe i can help you :P is there something you want to know in particular ? :)
<Cades> ive never heard of anything like that being done before :p
<Cades> i guess its better than blocking all the websites :p
<ToasterRepairPony> FO:E is pretty long...
<Cades> or do they still block them?
<Alchemist> Sergio_Scriptor: nothing in particular. what would come close but is maybe the conditions of the earth in it1s early years, about when life appeared.
<twilight_sprinkle> Sergio_Scriptor: your major is astrophysics?
<AJIsAwesome> ToasterRepairPony: I'm not one to read fanfics, but how about Keeping Your Hooves on the Ground?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Alchemist: well what can i say ? :D lava,fire dust,meteors and gene pools :P
<AJIsAwesome> SUDDEN STREAM
<killerpony7733> Yay dabi
<ofna01> BUFFA
<Lil_B> an enbodyied voice :O
<Sergio_Scriptor> twilight_sprinkle: i know my share of astropshicis yes :P
<AJIsAwesome> Hooray!
<Alchemist> Sergio_Scriptor: abiogenesis is one of chemistry's holy grails. if we knew exactly what were the contents of oceans/atmosphere we could produce life from no life.
<Blako> no
<alexxm> i'm scared
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<TheMonstaMuffin> xD
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Blako> you can acces all websites I think

<ofna01> NOOO
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: is that a recording of val?
<prince-dari> Yes
<Sergio_Scriptor> twilight_sprinkle: so far i will start university in 1 year :P

<ofna01> Rubberfruit is best gmodder
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Thanks. :$
<ekips> oh guys, who requested ponies?
<Dragonmatte> ofna01: Indeed!

<ScootaChicken> Grainy as hell.
<MadSurge> BladedWings: Mock The Week
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hold on, you're going to have to scroll all the way down to where it say downtown disney. I actually met them while I was on vacay with my fam in orlando. We actually saw them randomly at a Cici's pizza! http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/nightly-roundup-442.html#more
<BladedWings> ahh thanks guys...its a little funny lol

<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: you met with the guys in the picture?
<Everlasting_Joy> He's right, the sun screen on back piece.
<Kandarihu> Alright. I've been working on some things and if, for some reason, there are some streamer-related problems with BMN, I'm almost completely ready to fill in.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Me too. So many snacks to get. :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: It was at random, they just happened to be there when I was there.
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: cool :P
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: And hopefully, a Nostalgia Critic review in honor to him
<Meanwhile> I'm more amused by the fact that he knows the lines that well.
<Stallion_of_War> Is he doing The Pope?
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: do you have any pictures of yours?
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Dara's actually quite geeky. Loves science and maths.
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Oh I know, he's brilliant.
<pony_5Powzk> :D
<prince-dari> >Shawoddywoddy
<Meanwhile> Do you like the music?
<mentallyeffedguy> i feel funny....
<prince-dari> Woddeh woddeeeeeh
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: There's one more on the centrail brony meetup page. It's me, RainbroDash (not the one here, the one on youtube) and this other guy. It was a rainbow dash themed pic.
<Sergio_Scriptor> mentallyeffedguy: i know that feel...
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I thoroughly agree. If Dara leaves the show I don't know if I could be bothered with it. :S
<GilDash> Shawoddywoddy?! That's Hugh's line! XD
<mentallyeffedguy> OMG, i just got an idea!
<mentallyeffedguy> who is streaming?
<prince-dari> No one
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Welcome to Ponyville Act 1 Released!
<prince-dari> There's not stream right now
<prince-dari> no*
<Sergio_Scriptor> prince-dari: :d oh you
<Meanwhile> GilDash: If Dara left then Hugh and Andy would probably only hold it together for a while.
<Saturn> 08,01hehehehe
<mentallyeffedguy> well who is picking the videos then?
<Saturn> 08,01my boyfriend is being incredibly cute right now
<Caramel> 2,14 it's a ghost
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Yeah, but it'd rpbably be cancelled that season. :S
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Most likely.
<Sergio_Scriptor> mentallyeffedguy: the streamer is *censored by almighty mod power*
<MadSurge> Ohai Caramel!
<Bronysith> hi there Caramel how are you today?
<mentallyeffedguy> well dammit, i had an idea for a video
<applejack`> hello :)
<Meanwhile> If requests are being taken chat will be informed, if you are not informed assume requests are being ignored.
<mentallyeffedguy> well fuck
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi applejack` :P
<mentallyeffedguy> i wanted to share the video :(
<prince-dari> Is it just me, or is Andy Parsons usually not that funny?
<prince-dari> Sometimes he makes really good jokes, I ususally don't find him funny
<Meanwhile> He's a very particular localised brand of humour.
<MadSurge> Are these guys professional comedians?
<Meanwhile> I think much the same.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: aye
<Sergio_Scriptor> MadSurge: professional "british" comedians :P
<GilDash> prince-dari: He's very hit or miss, I find. When he's on the ball, he's on the ball, but that's few and far between sometimes.
<prince-dari> >The internet
<MadSurge> Sergio_Scriptor: of course :P
<prince-dari> They're talking about us
<Stallion_of_War> I'd watch it if it was Luna
<Meanwhile> Oh boy here we go
<GilDash> This'll be fun...
<Stallion_of_War> amazen?
<Stallion_of_War> Amazn
<Meanwhile> A great big cucumber.
<prince-dari> That just reminded me
<MadSurge> :D
<prince-dari> Next video
<prince-dari> Must be Gilbert Gottfreid
<Sergio_Scriptor> i hate 50 shades of gray...there are so many clopfics that are 10 times beter :|
<GilDash> Can you actually buy cucumbers over Amazon?
<AJIsAwesome> Gilbert Goddfried? :O
<AJIsAwesome> Yes! :D
<Meanwhile> GilDash: I was just wondering that.
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: Yes you can.
<alexxm> probably not GilDash
<MadSurge> prince-dari: just his voice is hilarious :D
<prince-dari> >Elsie
<Meanwhile> dari: Aristocrats joke?
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: I thought they'd started a gorcery section, but couldn't be sure. :S
<prince-dari> Nah, reading 50 shades of gray
<Stallion_of_War> Rose?
<Stallion_of_War> Rose Tyler?
<Meanwhile> Oh boy.
<Meanwhile> Schadenfreüde?
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: Out of curiosity, I searched some food on Amazon. Sure enough, there is a grocery section.
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: You thought I was making it up? XD
<Stallion_of_War> I bought Moon Pies off of Amazon
<Lil_B> Schadenfreude?
<Everlasting_Joy> GilDash: No no no! I knew you weren't. I was just telling you my story.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Stallion_of_War: "Moon pie ? what a time to be alive"
<prince-dari> Uncle Peter
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: Fair does. I wasn't accusing you or anything. :)
<Meanwhile> Uncle Peter is your god now.
<prince-dari> If it were Frankie, that joke would have gone so much further
<prince-dari> XD
<alexxm> uncle peter is best god
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: I worked at a company that sold via Amazon, so that's why I know as much as I do. :S
<Stallion_of_War> I do rather like the british pronounciation of ass
<GilDash> Stallion_of_War: *arse
<Meanwhile> Arse.
<Lil_B> today our english Teacher said "It's a Pain in the Arse" and nobody else knew that he just said Ass in school XD
<Stallion_of_War> "le googles"
<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: :D
<Stallion_of_War> ohh, Arse is the British version of ass
<Stallion_of_War> OK
<GilDash> Oi!
<GilDash> I'm Yorkish. -_-
<Meanwhile> Hah.
<Everlasting_Joy> This guy must be a fan of Star Wars.
*Stallion_of_War something something darkside
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I live in the same county you do. :p
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I'm what they would call "smart" for leaving. XD
<Lil_B> but our TEacher is actually schottich, but he's sounds like a british guy... at least to me XD
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Think of the scenery!

<Sergio_Scriptor> prince-dari: cause changing makes everything beter,just look at matt smith as the doctor * trollface*
<Paspie> Maybe I'm just sad
<Buytoast> Well get over it, because Hasbro wouldn't be stupid enough to change something that has had roughly the same formula for about 20 years
<prince-dari> Why would it mean that?
<Unnr> Saturn: every pony that´s anypony according to somepony use ratpoison

<Kandarihu> Scoot_Scootaloo is going to be doing an interview. Not sure if you have time for 3 episodes.
<Sergio_Scriptor> ekips: new or original series ?
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: It was exaggeration
<Snowflake> IAM GONNS PUNCH THIS BABY!
<ekips> Sergio_Scriptor both?^^
<Ponyloverforever> at least its not a puppy
<Meanwhile> We're on like...the last one had Sylar in Regenaladies house and he got shot.
<ekips> since I haven't seen the original sadlay
<pony_5Powzk> What is heros?
<Sergio_Scriptor> ekips: i prefer the original series :P but ok
<Ponyloverforever> idk
<Meanwhile> Oh and MPD lady was let out of prison.
<Sergio_Scriptor> ekips: well let me tell you the original series is awesome :)
<SafariMonkey> Oh Heroes? I'm gonna start from the beginning if I get enough recs. Anyone?
<Meanwhile> Oh!
<Meanwhile> Invisible guy and sponge man were watching future-painter and generic woman.
<Kandarihu> I remember we were past the point where Hiro confronted his father and got out of his duty to run the company
<SafariMonkey> AAGH Spoilers!
<ekips> Sergio_Scriptor Don't know if I could get into the original series after seeing the new
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah her biological father turned out to be fly guy
<SafariMonkey> OK I'm leaving before you ruin the show for me
<ekips> Sergio_Scriptor but if I have the opportunity to watch it, I'll give it a try
<CK|Werk> Heroes? :D
<CK|Werk> Yay~
<Sergio_Scriptor> ekips: yes you could :) the new one is just a revival,the same exact story,exept the original is only 1 season long :P so it's sort of short,but awesome :)
<Meanwhile> Lindahman
<Sergio_Scriptor> ekips: also in the original there is no "cyclons look like humans" crap :|
<SafariMonkey> Bye guys I might or might not be back for euro movie night
<Sergio_Scriptor> *cylons
<ekips> Sergio_Scriptor I always liked the side plots in the new one
<Sergio_Scriptor> SafariMonkey: bye for now :)
<twilight_sprinkle> why did he get suspended?
<Applejack2011> bye
<twilight_sprinkle> bye SafariMonkey
<GilDash> Which season is this?
<Meanwhile> 1
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: 1
<prince-dari> twilight_sprinkle: He went to horn rimmed glasses man's workplace
<GilDash> Really? Don't remember this. :S
<prince-dari> And tried to arrest him for some crazy evil scheme
<ekips> Sergio_Scriptor the series became some sort of too supernatural sometimes but that's okay imo
<Sergio_Scriptor> ekips: i think they are both interesting and boring at the same time,the original focused more on comedy and action and the main story,and it was prety cool straight forward and interesting :P
<SafariMonkey> Sergio_Scriptor and Applejack2011 and twilight_sprinkle: See you! *hugs to all*
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: was the scheme legit or did he make a mistake?
<Applejack2011> hug
<prince-dari> Legit
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k, thanks prince-dari
<prince-dari> But no one believes him
<twilight_sprinkle> same as always, nobody believes the good guy
<ekips> Sergio_Scriptor let's not discuss which series is better, not before I've seen both of them (I hope to do so on bronystate sometime)^^
<Dark_Horst> biiitch bitch bitch
<Thrackerzod> stab her
<Thrackerzod> with a knife
<Thrackerzod> n stuff

<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/Cv9JU.png
<Yagamilightisderpy> So, I'm with a internet so slow, because my brother is playing multyplayer tf2, and my sister is watching youtube videos, that it doesn't stop buffering

<Bronysith> Meanwhile: hedgehog dilemma
*Michael eats nachos

<FlareChaser> I've stopped with my OC and the shippings, it was pretty stupid I must admit, I'm keeping the name though.
<dr-whooves> Meanwwhile: Your death will be slow and painfull
<Yagamilightisderpy> *uses the death note to save sergio from daeth by killing his assaltaint*
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser: Pretty stupid? It was depressingly sad.

<Yagamilightisderpy> Sergio_Scriptor: No problem
<dr-whooves> facepwned
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Well you can't entirely blame him but she makes good art man :P

<Bronysith> People who hit below the belt are the lowest form of life besides people who actually make these "OCs"
<Meanwhile> Hey I stopped ages ago.
<Dark_Horst> did anyone else just ntoice him black out, or was that jsut my stream?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: i do want to knock some sense into him and explain that hating everything doesnt make you cool or anything of the sort, i try not ignore things, but yeah, im not in the mood for this right now
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: we best start stoppin
<Meanwhile> Piss off Sith!

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ah BlackGryph0n! It's been a while~
<Meanwhile> I want no part of this, I've been taking no part of this, stop assuming just because someone is on a hate binge that I'm somehow involved.
<Yagamilightisderpy> Hey Benickerson
<Saturn> 08,01FlareChaser: then why mention that you've stopped? why not just stay stopped?
<Michael> ohai Benickerson
<Hat> Yagamilightisderpy: have you tried refreshing
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Benickerson :)

<Buytoast> Becuase people need to say shit and seem like they matter.
<FlareChaser> Saturn: Because maybe I secretly didn't stopped about starting about being stopped? :3
<Yagamilightisderpy> Hat: eeeyup, it doesn't work, I'll wait till my brothers stop this game of tf2 manvsmachine
<pony_5Powzk> Cool!:O
<Bronysith> inb4 ban

<DaringDoo> I actually didn't care much for lesson zero
<CrimsonPhoenix> That thing?
<Yagamilightisderpy> what interviews?
<FlareChaser> Saturn: I want to ship... uh...that guy..and..that girl? .-.

<Yagamilightisderpy> So everyone here is a shipper
<yifle1> hows going

<Yagamilightisderpy> as long as you don't ship me with L I'm alright with that
<VenHur> Oh god, i'm not a shipper!
<Ath|chatderp7_> he's not the real blackgryphon
<Sergio_Scriptor> yifle1: your name sounds familiar...have we meet ?
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Puppies: i'm too predictable
<Bronysith> Yagamilightisderpy: dude, everyone and their mother have shipped Light and L
<Meanwhile> Implying the fanboys weren't already most of the audience.

<Meanwhile> Unnr|Puppies: That doesn't happen anymore.
<Yagamilightisderpy> Bronysith: No! that's impossible, it can't be true! (referenec joke)

<CrimsonPhoenix> Kurra, Space Jam isn't now
<Mishia> Remember in thouse days when anything that had a basketball/famous players was automaticaly cool- so people made movies with no effort/ games/ endourcements
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's later in the night
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03why was Space Jam a B movie? It was lie... my childhood :'(
<Kurra> what is now then? The newsletter isn't updated.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scoot-Scootaloo, cause the movie was based on a commercial
<Buytoast> it's a good movie
<Buytoast> but definately a B
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: look on the bright side, you get a good movie as B
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it was poor quality
<Wirisme> because the A/B thing makes no sense
<CrimsonPhoenix> lol jordan
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Space Jam is best movie
<Wirisme> but it was high budget
<Freefall29> space jam is more B movie, I loved it but space jam is B movie.

<Mishia> Scoot-Scootaloo: you know what, i bet kids at that age liked that special anyway....because they were busy laughing at the drugs being mentioned :P
<DashWithRainbows> Freefall29 it means people can not use that nick without the password you put. To use the nick, you'll need to identify yourself using /ns identify <your password>
<Michael> the hell is that?
<DashWithRainbows> Of course, that's what I have to do with mIRC.
*Shizuka 13may or may not be responsible for compiling this playlist
<Meanwhile> otakon quick, tell me how your day was.
<Freefall29> ok. I'll register my name
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*ahem*
<Meanwhile> If I had stream running I'm sure it'd be lovely.
<Freefall29> all I gotta do is say /register.... right
<Yagamilightisderpy> the worse part was the president stalling the start of the cartoon, or so I've been told
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It's alrught, Shizu, I blame SaxyPretender anyway!
<FlareChaser> .-.

<Mishia> So.... i bought garrys mod without counter strike source....
<Sergio_Scriptor> Kurra: galaxy quest and space jam
<DaringDoo> :O
<FlareChaser> Mishia: Multiplayer is worthless.
<Freefall29> Mishia: ya really should have bought ccs as well
<Kurra> THANK YOUUUUU d-C8-b
<Shizuka> 13Mishia: not a problem, a few of the custom maps need it for textures though
<Mishia> FlareChaser: I've been paying dearly with the blinding texture errors
<Unnr> Freefall29: You a CS-Source player?
<Yagamilightisderpy> not sure if it's my internet or the image are just sloppy
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No chance, do your dance!
<Buytoast> god dammit barkley
<FlareChaser> Mishia: Same, I don't even own CSS and that is why I don't play Gmod 24/7 ;~;
<Mishia> Shizuka: just like with me playing with no mouse, i manage.....
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Cause it's a space JAM!
<Freefall29> Unnr: yeah. I got ccs and cs 1.6. play it pretty casually, but its fun.
<Shizuka> 13only reason to buy CS:S with gmod is so there's no dependency issues with maps
<Mozdoc> Songs are repetitive...
<XAX> Shizuka: And it's an alright game .-.
<Shizuka> 13some really nice ones need CS:S textures and models, like the desktop computer
<Shizuka> 13now that it loads l4d natively it might pull from there though
*Unnr is still amazed by the numbers of 1.6 players
<Michael> dat katamari in the background
<Mishia> Shizuka: if you dont.... well many a texture online will become puruple checkers and items glowing error signs.
<otakon> hiya Shizuka how's Torchlight 2 so far?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Yagamilightisderpy> Names so I can put it in my death note please, of the terrible actors who made the horrible movies you watch

<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film's script originally contained a mention of Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman's character) having been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. Rickman asked that this be changed because he believed it was inconsistent with the character, and all mentions of the knighting were removed. However, the character is still listed in the credits as "Sir Alexander Dane".
