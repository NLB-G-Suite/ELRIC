<Evil_Spike> 4 player coop? COOL!
<Vordox> RustyMeat: Damn right
<Dken2021_> RustyMeat yea, miyamoto prefers speaking japanese than english
<Sylandest> GilDash: you never know! The nintendo bug might come out and getcha when you least expect it
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: i hope so :D
<Michael> that would be cool
<valoreins|Work> i observe that most nintendo games are mostly surrealistic.. thx to mario lol
<StevenHyde> He rehearsed his speech, he's not ever listening to Miyamoto.
<CrazyCherry> Starweardo: :D
<Princess_Molestia> NO OLIMAR?!?! WHAT IS THIS FUCKERY?!
<GilDash> Sylandest: I'm not getting another console when I switch over to PC.
<alexxm> hey RainbowcrashNBurn hows your day been
<pikorar> Okay, I don't really like the idea of Wii U, but NEW PIKMIN!

<FillyFlam> Dude, Nintendo just won E3.
<yifle1> i grew up with harry potter for ps1 not pikmin

<SlurryMoon> 3yes he does Nittany_Discord, he just finds it easier to have a translater
<Tov|Christmas> Looks the same as Pikmin 2. SEEEQUEELLS
<Viri> 14heh

<RainbowcrashNBurn> did i hear that right...they showing 23 games in this hour?

<Hooves> but caps+canterlot(a.k.a loud) voice=A CAPALOT VOICE
<Tov|Christmas> I'm sad to announce...
<cachi01|E3> MIYAMOTO IS CELESTIA OF GAMING
<Tov|Christmas> That's actually a big deal.
<Pwah> 2 game pads!
<Darkts3> wow 2 controllers?
<StevenHyde> I'm so excited, I have to buy two now! : D
<Lambo> Will Wii-Motes on Wii U?
<valoreins|Work> |Master-Derpy|: u miss Miyamoto being badass
<Lil_B> cachi01|E3 no... Luna
<Evil_Spike> Two gamepads
<Scarlet> Mah boi, this DUAL WIELD is what all true warriors strive for.
<AttackWithHugs> TWO! That's one more than 1!
<mitamaking> Lambo: yeah
<TrixieBaconMuffin> he wastes 30% of his speechtime with Wii U and Nintendo
<AlienEd27> DOUBLE GAMEPADS!!! what does it meeaaan?
<Kandarihu> Assymetric gameplay. They tried this with Pacman Vs. My only shot with that game was a terrible experience.
<Evil_Spike> Let's see this gamepad
<Tov|Christmas> My cat has 4 pads. Wii U - 0 My cat - 1.
<Michael> inb4 painting games
<Nickario_Mobile> And Tom jones on tv eeeeww
<AttackWithHugs> AlienEd27: It's so beautiful! *sobs*
<StevenHyde> Nintendo Wii DS.
<Dken2021_> Kandarihu I love that game
<Evil_Spike> Wow, that's going to be awkward to control with
<Starweardo> More like PSWii.
<RustyMeat> ZR AND ZL
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Drinking Game : take a shot everytime he says Wii U or Nintendo!
<RustyMeat> YES
<Hooves> I AM SPEAKING IN A CANTERLOT VOICE BWAHAHAHA
<Hooves> :3
<Evil_Spike> FPS games, Nintendo?
<CrimsonPhoenix> RUMBLE
<Lambo> Nice
<cachi01|E3> I would really prefer the sticks were below the y b a x buttons and not above
<Starweardo> Hooves: FUCK YEAH CANTERLOCK!
<Hooves> LOOOOOOOOOOOL
<Lambo> Headphone jacket on the controller- that is VERY NICE Nintendo. Good thinking
<Barbetos|AtWork> THis kind of reminds me of the old Xbox controllers, the ones that left bruises on the knuckles.
<Darkts3> Wii is so advanced =/
<StevenHyde> It's a Nintendo conference, TrixieBaconMuffin. I'd be on the floor before he gets to Mario.
<Everlasting_Joy|E3> Rumbly bumbly.
<mitamaking> Evil_Spike: I saw enough FPSs yeasterday
<Scarlet> This has everything.
<Kandarihu> And spying?
<Tov|Christmas> Looks expensive
<ekips> Rumble+motion control doesn't sound like a smart idea
<Starweardo> WiiUTheMicrophone.
<Strange-Benhur> :)
<Evil_Spike> Wow, that has a bit much stuff on there
<Wrek|Dusty> 05that volume control looked somewhat fragile
<Hooves> I DONT NEED A FUCKING MICROHPONE!! RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHJ
<Lambo> Tov|Christmas: About 70 bucks, I think
<Pwah> :$
*AlienEd27 does not have money for such stuff
<CrimsonPhoenix> ekips wiimote has rumbles
<pikorar> God, those controllers have got to cost $200 a piece.
<mitamaking> Hooves: Play Phoenix Wright and say that
<Evil_Spike> So basically, it's the DS touchpad
<alexxm> why does every game have to have a social side now
<yifle1> im happy that i have my psp 3g wit cfw
<Kandarihu> I'd rather make sure that the camera and microphone have to be connected when not in use.
<Lambo> Who will use the fucking Microphone? Create a dedicated Nintendo Headset
<AttackWithHugs> pikorar: increase the price about 100 dollars
*Tov|Christmas looks at the gun
<Michael> mario!
<The_Si> No, me first!
<Lambo> ZELDA
<Pwah> MEEBERS!
<GilDash> pikorar: Which means in the UK they'll cost £250... :S
<Lambo> WOO
<teh|PheonixWright> They need to announce Pheonix wright...
<TrixieBaconMuffin> New Wii U , so many buttons you're bound to touch some by accident
<StevenHyde> Look it's a gun!
<Hooves> kongregate?
<CrimsonPhoenix> teh|PheonixWright, good luck with that
<Nickario_Mobile> Derp
<Kandarihu> Er, I'd rather the camera and microphone can be physically disconnected when not in use.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's Capcom business
<AlienEd27> f*@k the mainstream
<Litwick> DRAWING DICKS ON THE TELEVISION
<Lil_B> Evil_Spike can you stop bitching around and actually pay attention so you don't get everything wrong?
<Scarlet> I used the wii before it was cool.
<Evil_Spike> Do I see DK?
<Scarlet> wiiU
<Dken2021_> Lambo nintendo's been known to make periphials then don't use them, ie the wii heart rate sensor
<Tov|Christmas> Wii U's got a gun
<StevenHyde> Wait, if I draw a dick, it'll be sent to others! This is perfect!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> for Mario!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> this looks pretty awesome
<FillyFlam> Each Mii is sentient.

<Cypresswolf> wait...what about a Nintendo theme park?
<StevenHyde> Well, they announced Brawl several years in advance, and when it was late everyone flipped out. They don't want that to happen with SSB4.
<mitamaking> Hooves: This is one hour in, Microsoft bored us for 2 hours so shut up
<Dken2021_> Evil_Spike well they just developed the WiiU so it's perhaps still in development phanse
<Pwah> kinda like mario party 2!
<Evil_Spike> I still want something

<Welsh_Pony> Derpy in link to the past? All of my money
<Strange-Benhur> IT IS ON LIKE DONKEY KONG!
<Malavolent> Is it just me, or the graphics are getting worse with every game?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This better not be their killer title
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not 3 shots.
<RyunosukeKnT> Nittany_Discord: I dont want to go to nintendoland, it reminds me of Captain N: The Game Master ;)
<Kandarihu> Yup. Zelda has yet to either stagnate or jump the shark.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Dude, you can't even count now. Please stop. :D
<Evil_Spike> Tech demo
<Cedridor> Whaaaaat...
<Lil_B> Takamaru is a Ninja from an old Japan only NES Game
<Lil_B> Made by nintendo
<mitamaking> SuperBrony64: I think this is their Wii Sports for the Wii U
<StevenHyde> Oh, I didn't know that.
<Tov|Christmas> Wii there be Zombies in this… uh… game?
<Lil_B> *Samurai... not ninja
<Iron_Edge> SuperBrony64: :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I cahi coutn finee rer
<SuperBrony64> 11,02mitamaking: That would make sense

<Evil_Spike> This better not be their big announcement
<Michael> lol
<Malavolent> All I see is Equestria.
<CrimsonPhoenix> guys it's only been 1 hour
<Hooves> Malavolent eeee-yup
<DitzyHooves> I wonder if they have a Pokemon one
<Tov|Christmas> The big announcement is the Wii U price.
<Michael> need to ponify this
<Pwah> So Awesome! :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$9001
<yifle1> im actually dissapontent in these new games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That'll be the price.
<Dken2021_> Tov|Christmas 599 us dollars
<Welsh_Pony> Wii U price 599 US dollers
<Kandarihu> If they don't mention the price, it'll be worrisome.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Really?
<Pwah> ITS AN OVERUSED MEME!
<DitzyHooves> I would guess about $200-$300
<Master-Derpy> its over 9000$
<Lil_B> FivehundretandnintynineUsDollars
<Malavolent> yifle1: So am I.
<Michael> wat 600$?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wii U will retail for $899 USD
<mitamaking> Dken2021_, Welsh_Pony: If they want it to die
<DitzyHooves> nah
<Dark_Horst> oh god, little kids with god complexes? that'll be the future of the wii?

<valoreins|Work> i'm more dissapointed with M$
<DitzyHooves> I would guess about $200-$300
<cachi01|E3> and all this awesomness just for the little price of 1000000$
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011 million money.
<Wrek|Dusty> 05so the wii U remote is the game master. and the others the puppets
<Wrek|Dusty> 05OMG a D&D game for Wii
<Tov|Christmas> Were any new games actually announced here?
<Wrek|Dusty> 05FUND IT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01M$ was awful.
<E3Surge> Internet killed itself. AGAIN. What did I miss?
<Hooves> nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine.
<SirGanjalf> OVER 500$
<DitzyHooves> that's what nintendo normally prices stuff as
<mitamaking> Tov|Christmas: a few
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They weren't selling games half the time.
<StevenHyde> Nintendo Zone.
<Yokupony> Wrek|Dusty: YES< DO IT!!!
<Kandarihu> I'm sure the Wii U will retail for a price that's competitive with 360 and PS3. I'm worried about the price of those controllers.
<valoreins|Work> this is the best of all the E3 so far
<Vordox> Wrek|Dusty: Lawl, Maaaaybe
<StevenHyde> *Land, not Zone.
<Tov|Christmas> Where's my F-Zero and Starfox?
<Lil_B> Wrek To Kickstarter *whoooop*
<Master-Derpy> pacman!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Pacman
<DitzyHooves> I would guess about $200-$300
<cachi01|E3> or else :o
<SirGanjalf> Pacman 3D?
<yifle1> Malavolent :)
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Everything here is to try and show off the Wii U though... :S
<mitamaking> Pacman Vs.?
<Evil_Spike> They DIE!
<DitzyHooves> what P4 price?
<Litwick> Pac-Man!
<SirGanjalf> Pacman's Mansion!
<yifle1> pacman clone
<Dken2021_> Pacman vs: mario edition
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But they've shown more titles than M$
<alexxm> this is basically pac man with mario isn't it
<RainbowcrashNBurn> did i imagine it earlier, or is ACIII on wii u?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01.
<Litwick> Oh my god it is PacMan Versus!
<DitzyHooves> yes it is
<cachi01|E3> its pacman vs but with miis
<DitzyHooves> yes it is pacman
<Malavolent> Nittany_Discord: What did Microsoft show? I missed their presentation.
<mitamaking> RainbowcrashNBurn: It is
<DitzyHooves> lol
<Lil_B> RainbowcrashNBurn yes it is on WiiU
<Kandarihu> This is giving me flashbacks to that travesty that unfolded when I finally had a chance to play PacMan Vs
<SirGanjalf> 1 Ghost and 4 players? This is Madness!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> awesome
<yifle1> Malavolent im more the old games
<mitamaking> Malavolent: Less than this
<DitzyHooves> what is the PS4 price?
<Tov|Christmas> looks frustrating as hell.
<DitzyHooves> so like ghostbusters
<Lambo> DitzyHooves: Haha, probably 600 at least
<cachi01|E3> i was never able to play pacman vs :(
<StevenHyde> Can the ghost go through walls?
<pony_2843> Huh... Interesting
<SirGanjalf> Pacman meets Ghostbusters
<Dken2021_> DitzyHooves was that revealed in the sony conference?
<Malavolent> yifle1: I usually like the old games better, though there are some bright expections.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Malavolent: Sequels, Kinect crap, and new XLB services.
<Wrek|Dusty> 05i think most of this is to show what its capable of
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: And in typical Nintendo fasion, nearly all of them have been sequels or spin-offs. :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*XBL
<DitzyHooves> nah... Nintendo would never go that high.
<valoreins|Work> and Usher
<alexxm> this looks needlessy complicated
<yifle1> Malavolent i know
<Wrek|Dusty> 05to give the game designers some ideas
<Hooves> oh ditzyhooves, i keep thinking i get messages
<Hooves> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01None of the XBL stuff was game-related.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wrek|Dusty: They did that last year though :<
<StevenHyde> Did that ghost just rape Wario?
<yifle1> Malavolent im still playing on my ps1
<pony_2843> Dun dun duuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnn
<DitzyHooves> they have never priced something really over $300
<Yokupony> SURPIZE BUTTSEX!
<Pwah> lawl!
<Lil_B> Ghost is Molestia
<Malavolent> Nittany_Discord: It seems like E3 is all about Kinect and Wii.
<pony_2843> LOL
<Evil_Spike> RAPE!
<Tov|Christmas> Nintendo does't have enough goodwill in the West to sell a $600 console.
<yifle1> Malavolent and im allways playing ps1 games on my psp
<Hooves> Buutsecs
<HatchetRyda> flashlight revival
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sequels and motion controls.
*Wrek|Dusty hands SuperBrony64 soem of his nachos (its basicalyl what it is)
<Lambo> Tov|Christmas: He asked for PS4
<mitamaking> Malavolent: Wii U you mean
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Every year.
<Lambo> Wii U will cost around 300
<Lambo> PS4 around 600
<Kandarihu> So it's a cross between Pac-Man Vs and Left 4 Dead?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: what did i miss during the 3ds section, my pc froze and got it back just as they left talking about 3ds
*Michael nomz popcorn
*SuperBrony64 noms on nachos
<Malavolent> mitamaking: Whatever the name, it's very similiar.
<pony_2843> o_O
<RustyMeat> rpae
<DitzyHooves> Nintendo makes the new stuff, and X box does the same thing but more $$$ and slightly better
<Strange-Benhur> RAPE
<Lil_B> I say WiiU around 350$
<Yokupony> That ghost is a bastard
<Malavolent> yifle1: I used to have PS1 too, good times...
*Shimmer steals some nachos from Wrek|Dusty
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Luigi 4 Dead
<SuperBrony64> 11,02RainbowcrashNBurn: New Super Mario Bros. 2, Paper Mario Sticker...something, and Luigi's Mansion
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is the ghost an AI character?
<DitzyHooves> Nintend creates Wii first.... Xbox creates Kinect
<Hooves> how do you get that italic text?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, no
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: Thought so XD
<alexxm> this looks needlessy complicated
<yifle1> Malavolent yeah what games did you grew up with ?
<mitamaking> Ghost is the pad player
<CrimsonPhoenix> the one having the gamepad is the ghost
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This sounds fun.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: all 3 of those sound good to me, especially paper mario
<pony_2243> Ghost is player 5.
<Pwah> Looks cool ^^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah ^-^
<cachi01|E3> ths sounds awesome
<pony_2843> Looks pretty good
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: So many ways you can troll XD
<Evil_Spike> Interesting concept
<DitzyHooves> I hope they have a pokemon one
<SuperBrony64> 11,02GTFO GIMME STAR FOX
<mitamaking> I mean it looks fun, but not killer app
<Kandarihu> DitzyHooves: funny how Microsoft's been more successful. Well, it would be funny if it weren't so sad.
<alexxm> it looks intresting
<Evil_Spike> Smash Bros now?
<Hooves> woah, im hearing japanease in one ear and english coming out the other O_O
<Lambo> Japanese. Always so polite
<Tov|Christmas> I STILL don't know what this is.
<alexxm> hows it feel Hooves
<Pwah> 0u0
<Shimmer> Prease take a rook
<RyunosukeKnT> okay seriously
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: The Wii outsold Xbox 360 by a 3 to 1 margin
<Hooves> pwah

<Yokupony> COLOURZZ

<Vordox> Hooves: That's called "Linguistic" :P
<Pwah> huh?
<RyunosukeKnT> this reminds me of Captain N: The Gamemaster :)
<pony_2243> I saw the Sony E3 vid. They have their own version of Smash Brothers.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02THANKS NINTENDO FOR MAKING A NINTENDO LAND AND IT'S NOT THE REAL KIND YOU CAN ACTUALLY VISIT
<DitzyHooves> without the Wii I don't think Microsoft would have thought of the Kinect
<Michael> i see triforce
<OtakuTom> Was that supposed to me Mecha Ridley?
<yifle1> yawn
<DitzyHooves> Nintendo does stuff first.
<E3Surge> Did they announce other games than Luigi's Mansion 2?
<Hooves> lol i hear lots of beeps and know im doing it
<Iron_Edge> SuperBrony64: :D
<Malavolent> yifle1: I always prefered PC over consoles, for example I remember playing old Apogee games, Duck tales, Doom series etc. My most favourite game on PS1 is Ace Combat though.
<cachi01|E3> why r they showing equestria footage?
<Pwah> yes Hooves?
<Hooves> GAH OWIE MY EARS
<StevenHyde> Nintendo Land is going around in a circle over and over again.
<DasPinkiez> I think i sa kirby?

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nintendo Land: Nuts and Bolts
<Darkts3> thats a lot of minigames
<RyunosukeKnT> so.. a virtual theme park
<RyunosukeKnT> :p
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 but this is for everyone at anytime for the nice price of FREE (or 60 for an lifetime-ticket)
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: Wii U looks awesome, if any of the games shown so far are launch games, im gonna preoder the Wii U :P
<Hooves> dont say hooves!
<pony_2843> Now we just need a real theme park >.

<Everlasting_Joy|E3> This was a far better presentation then Sony's.
<Hooves> HORROR GAME
<Dken2021_> pre-show again?
<pikorar> Fun Fact: E3 2012 is the most depressing, anticlimactic thing ever.
<Lil_B> this was.. underwhelming, but still better then the other 2
<Hooves> ugh dafuq?
<AttackWithHugs> SOMEBODY SAY BOO
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was still better than Microsoft
<StevenHyde> BOO
<Tov|Christmas> So, Pikmin 3.

<HatchetRyda> BOO!
<AttackWithHugs> lol in the audience
<Hooves> i didnt have a choice jappy man :|
<AnnoyingBrony> lol asian talking english
<Lambo> So far Nintendo presentation was a rollercoaster ride. Constant change between "Fuck yeah" and "Oh, god, why..." - so awkward things
<pony_2843> Looking forward to Pikmin 3 :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CrimsonPhoenix: Agreed.
<pony_2243> On the 6th is the 3DS show. All the new 3DS games will be shown.
<Tov|Christmas> It was about as good as Sony's conference.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: calm down, there must be more announced as we get closer to launch
<HatchetRyda> AttackWithHugs: you need to be specific
<yifle1> IM VERY DISSAPOINTET IN THESE GAMES TO MANY MARIO GAMES

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hey Octavias_Pride :)
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: i was so hoping for new smash bros, happy about pikmin and both the supermario bros games

<alexxm> dat acting
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's beautifull
<Tov|Christmas> White activities
<GilDash> Sylandest: The worst of the bunch so far. You could predict M$ sucking, but Sony hit a new low.
<Lambo> I HATE these fucking "happy family" ads...
<Darkts3> DUCKS. BUT THIS TIME THE GAME IS REAL
<SuperBrony64> 11,02THAT'S NOT PILOTWINGS, GTFO

<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Onlyin relation to the new Wii.
<Iron_Edge> SuperBrony64: :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> You can do that with the 3DS, why are they suprised?
<mitamaking> yifle1: Nintendo?
<cachi01|E3> this is beatiful i think imight get this for my mom
<RyunosukeKnT> umm

<Dken2021_> what is going on?
<Hooves> fucking happy families agrreeing with heach other IT IS SO FUCKING FAKE LOOKING
<RyunosukeKnT> we get it :)
<Sundaysmile> are they playing duckhunt?
<Kandarihu> That's kind of the reaction that my mom gets from any depictions of water in just about any game.
<Yokupony> I'M A FUCKING BIRD!!!!
<pony_2243> I hope the 3DS show has Majora's Mask 3DS.

<derp> cool but bad acting
<yifle1> mitamaking pokemon and ps1
<AttackWithHugs> why do they never show a raging family? i'd lol
<GilDash> Sylandest: I'm not a particular fan of Sony anyway. :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> pony_2243: Damn right, OoT is alone
<Dken2021_> "it's a mii! wow!"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Scoot-Scootaloo: They announced NINTENDO LAND
<Litwick> Scoot-Scootaloo: Nintendo never fails.
<HatchetRyda> she had some big eyes
<DitzyHooves> nintendo ROCK
<DitzyHooves> s
<Whovianpony> I will admit that looks pretty cool
<Sylandest> GilDash: hehehe :D
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: Last of us = Must buy, Lara Croft = Must Buy.
<Saturn> 08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: i could tell you what i learned, but you probably wouldn't like it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02NINTENDO LAND
<cachi01|E3> nintendo was awesome :)
<Iron_Edge> Scoot-Scootaloo: That purple pikmin is best pikmin! =D
<alexxm> they should do an advert with a realstic family
<pony_2843> I can go outside and do the same thing :P
<mitamaking> Scoot-Scootaloo: Pikmin is going to be good and Nintendo needs lessons in what to end E3 on
<Welsh_Pony> Take a drink everytime they said "Wow"
<Very_Silly_Filly> SuperBrony64: Sounds like a theme park
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Of all the things...NINTENDO LAND
<Pwah> Nintendo Land ^u^
<Yokupony> Dat Sensor
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: M$ and Nintendo have done the same thing. Nintendo has just been much more subtle about it.
<yifle1> three sensors
<StevenHyde> I don't even know what Geomagnetic means.
<DitzyHooves> nintendo know how to market to a large audience.
<Kandarihu> Um, a Nintendo trailer... and people are oohing and aahing at graphics?
<Dken2021_> Scoot-Scootaloo nintendo needs to hold on the mario a few years
<pony_2843> But it does open up many possibilities
<The_Si> STICKERS AND GOLD EVERYWHERE.
<Saturn> 08,01StevenHyde: compases
<Malavolent> <----- Quiet, you!
<Dken2021_> Scoot-Scootaloo hold back *
<SuperBrony64> 11,02NO, I DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT NINTENDO LAND
<StevenHyde> DAMMIT
<Saturn> 08,01StevenHyde: geomagnetism is the earth's magnetic field
<Pwah> I DO!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: yeh, Nintendo land was dissapointing, happy about everything else shown though
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I learned that Nintenod doesn't care abou Pokemon or Super Smash Bros. ;_;
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sony failed with PS All Stars Cash-In SSBB Clone.
<Michael> let's see :)
<yifle1> NOT ANYMORE NITENDO LAND
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What a tease
<cachi01|E3> is it good that i screamed like a little fangirl when i heard oikmin 3?
<mitamaking> Nintendo Land, it will sell great, just like Wii Sports
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WHAT A TEASE
<Malavolent> They're trying too hard...
<Darkts3> LOL
<pony_2843> The biggest hype for Nintendo: Nintendo Land lol
<Malavolent> Oh god, not another ad.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Imo, Nintendo are best, they are pretty much one of the few companys who do not give a fuck about graphics and polish
<E3Surge> PACKEJ
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: I know.
<Kandarihu> cachi01|E3: sure.
<Malavolent> I'd rather see G3 than this.
<AnnoyingBrony> lol that asian look like a dick hahaha
<mitamaking> Malavolent: welcome to E3?
<pony_2243> Those stickers in the Paper Mario 3DS remind me of the powerup stickers in Smash Brothers Brawl.
<Dken2021_> Nittany_Discord you seen that screenshot of their youtube video with the ssb tags?
<Pwah> animal crossing!
<ScootaChicken> I HEAR ANIMAL CROSSING
<Very_Silly_Filly> And care more for gameplay and tech
<ScootaChicken> WHAT IS THIS MADNESS
<Shimmer> This is where I sign off... later everypony!

<derp> i wouldnt mind this actually
<yifle1> BORRING
<Strange-Benhur> SNORE!
<Pwah> nice music :3
<DitzyHooves> Asymetric gameplay has so much oppurtunity
<Vordox> OH GOD
<CrimsonPhoenix> controlling two characters? oh dear
<ScootaChicken> Haha
<E3Surge> They're so embarassing
<Vordox> HARD CONTROLS <3
<ScootaChicken> >families

<Yokupony> Show us your Zelda!
<mitamaking> My brain hurts controlling with two sticks
<ScootaChicken> HAHAHA
<pony_2843> Guess it's for the family lol
<DitzyHooves> IMAGINE if it were used in Hunger Games video game
<SirGanjalf> family games
<Malavolent> mitamaking: I wouldn't say a word if it was an actual trailer, but these fake actor families piss me off to no end.
<Very_Silly_Filly> If families made this much noise during this game, I'd force them to see the docs
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"Animal Crossing? Zelda? Mario? and more...all in one game?" *gets up 'OMG SMASH BROS.'* "NINTENDO LAND!!" *throws Wii Remote at screen*
<The_Si> COMPLEX GAMEPLAY
<derp> i would get it:)
<DitzyHooves> Asymetric gameplay has so much oppurtunity
<yifle1> USE THE WII U AS A CONTROLER
<DitzyHooves> IMAGINE if it were used in Hunger Games video game
<RainbowcrashNBurn> SuperBrony64: Nintendo land looks like the Wii U version of wii sports, a launch game that shows off the features of the console
<mitamaking> Malavolent: This is the triler
<Lambo> That girl is pretty cute
<Sundaysmile> This is hardcore gaming
<Pwah> LOL!
<thisguy> x.x
<cachi01|E3> messge of the game: obesity is bad

<Alchemist> the hell is this?
<Derpy_at_work> who's streaming?
<pony_2843> Pink... Elephant!?!?!?!?
<pony_2243> Nintendo needs to release Mother 3. It's been ages.
<Very_Silly_Filly> SuperBrony64: You still need your Wiimote
<Darkts3> Scoot-Scootaloo: IKR
<Welsh_Pony> Only listening to the sound....Sounds rude
<Dken2021_> I like this simulated family
<valoreins|Work> so....casual...
<Tov|Christmas> I hope this NintendoLand is free.
<yifle1> THIS IS JUST BORRING
<AttackWithHugs> I want to see an angry family on these game ads from now on. Nintendo, make it happen.
<RyunosukeKnT> FU SPIKE
<Sundaysmile> That granny is such a camping bitch
<Very_Silly_Filly> pony_2243: I disagree. The legal cuts would rape what makes the game good
<Alchemist> Scoot-Scootaloo: its not MLG until hyperventillating is involved.
<Sylandest> Dken2021_: I know, right? where would ever we find a family that really is like this?
<Tov|Christmas> ahem, that's Squirrel has a name: Peanut
<Malavolent> Overacting much?
<derp> i would get this it reminds me of mario party
<AnnoyingBrony> LOL casual gamers
<RyunosukeKnT> M$ / Nintendo / Sony is NOT the only game developers at E3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Imagine Luna in this
<E3Surge> And then everyone died. the end
<Tov|Christmas> did she say shit?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I hope they make a mario party for the 3DS
<DitzyHooves> casual gamers = $$$$$
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh how much fun she would have
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can't get the DS one anywhere
<cachi01|E3> xddd ohhhh casual gamers
<pony_2243> What about an English version of the NES Mother game. Nothing 'bad' in that one.
<Master-Derpy> ....
<Sundaysmile> what's with that soundtrack?
<Vordox> DONKEY KONG!?
<Cedridor> *sigh*
<Pwah> 0.0
<Sylandest> GilDash: see, its when content like this comes out that I feel disappointment for my console...lol

<GilDash> Sylandest: I'm just going back to PC and putting the blinders on. :D

<Alchemist> really? they need high tier microchips and electronics to emulate a game my grandfather had?
<Pwah> SPLAT!
<cachi01|E3> DED
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I stopped watching. Also, I'm passing blood from the shots I took =p
<StevenHyde> "Will you shut the fuck up and let me play my game, JIMMY?"
<Sundaysmile> It's a good thing these games aren't hardcore, a controller that expensive would be a helluva thing to waste throwing it against a wall when overcome by console rage
<DitzyHooves> it has RUMBLE yay!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So many drinks.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Then again, I'm happy with my 3DS atm
<Radu> PSP is sooo underrated.
<Lil_B> Radu, bigger screen and actual Joysticks instead of these Slide-Pads
<Lambo> And suddenly the boy asked "Mommy would like this." And this ad turns into a sad family drama about cancer and loss
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I warned you. :D
<pony_2843> Now now, it does show a possible, oh say, Star Fox game for the Wii U :P
<Pwah> 3DS > PSP ^^

<pony_2843> pony_2243: lol Was suppose to. That little phrase is now stuck in my head forever :P

<Sundaysmile> well you're about to go banana's
<WingedCurse> why were people expecting zelda? they release like every 5 years and we just got one
<Sundaysmile> On the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOn
<Very_Silly_Filly> Give them credit, they are trying to revolutionize gaming rather than make it more powerful
<alexxm> i'm good TheRainbowDash got the week off
<TheRainbowDash> SuperBanana64: Why you a banana now?:D
<Scarlet> Does this mean i need a new wii?
<mitamaking> Yeah like you are playing with family and not friends
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Oh, lucky filly.
<SuperBanana64> 11,02TheRainbowDash: Fruit hour :)
<mitamaking> Scarlet: Wii U
<Dken2021_> Scarlet looks like it
<pony_2243> I still have DK 64 and both that and me N64 still work.

<CrimsonPhoenix> and Kirby? We had one VERY LATE on the Wii
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'll get one once the price drops
<Sylandest> GilDash: I just want more proper games...move away from family games please...lol
<TheRainbowDash> SuperBanana64: Yes, a new tradition for Bronystate. Is toast a fruit?
<Malavolent> SuperBanana64: Again?
<pony_2843> I wish I still had DK64. I never finished it! >.<
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have a wii and 3DS atm, and fine with them
<mitamaking> Scarlet: That is like asking if the PS3 is different than the PS2

<Lil_B> I still have DK64+N64... I LOVE it
<thisguy> and f zero gx
<Lambo> pony_2243: These old games took 200 hours to finish, anyway, haha
<GilDash> Sylandest: That's why I won't go over to Nintendo. I'm a hardcore gamer at heart, and all this motion sensitive crap doesn't appeal to me.

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> dat ass

<Sundaysmile> Sonic ass races
<DasPinkiez> Everyone used their wii fit once, and then never used it again, why do Nintend think its a good idea to release a THIRD wii fit game, it's just madness
<DitzyHooves> he's supposed to have his feet off the floor though
<derp> i dont like ppl making fun of nintendo because they gave us our childhood cmon guys they are bound to make another great game plz dont put it down
<Yokupony> SO INTENSE!

<Sundaysmile> Soooooooo much carpet burn
<TheRainbowDash> pony_9996: Time to go to the future.

<teh|PheonixWright> lol
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, i prefer living in a city to the countrysie
<AttackWithHugs> Hay SuperBrony64|FOOD, can you turn the volume up a little more?
<Cypresswolf|Work> Some of the intro close ups in this show look far different from what they actually turn out being - I never would have guessed it was Spike's nose if you showed me a still frame
<Saturn> 08,01but this is just where i live right now
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: nay, not yet. Still getting dinner, i believe
<Saturn> 08,01have to live, because of uni

<Lakorv> also I haven't worked with MySQL much, only sqlite. Not that it matters much for such a tiny website anyway.
<Saturn> 08,01finish off my teacher training there, maybe
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: do not take the challenge unless you are fully ready. you better make sure you dont have any plans ahead of time, and that you're ready for no sleep at all
<sagas> Saturn: Agreed! Ive lived in the country most of my life, but I would kill to live in the city. The country can get really boring
<pony_996> this is mlp
<Saturn> 08,01i'm still not decided on whether i want to continue with it or not
<Very_Silly_Filly> A fat tire
<Very_Silly_Filly> Tyre, jesus
<Dken2021_> lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> Confound you Americans
<Saturn> 08,01the choice at the moment seems to be "become a teacher" or "do a PhD"
<Acheron187> Spike dog is the the best dummy bear
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: exactly
<teh|PheonixWright> I think we should stream the challenge...
<|Discord|> Man...why is the little gurl such a bitch.

<Articuno> 12But may have an idea of where the problem is so I am trying to fix
<MahBoi777> Very_Silly_Filly: AMERICA
<Lakorv> first I'll be making a content page, and ponder whether or not to include all posts in all language menus because I write so little.
<Saturn> 08,01should i become a teaecher now, or should i do a PhD?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Britan's where it's at
<|Discord|> Saturn: Become a PhD easier'
<LordDerpington> derpy_pony: Oh, heavens, she's even got her scrunch-face!
<Michael> derpy_pony: so much money :(
<Lakorv> then I can start thinking about whether or not I want a comment system at all.
<TheRainbowDash> Saturn: Go for a PhD.
<Hawkie> ah ^^
<|Discord|> Elvies
<Hawkie> ok
<derpy_pony> depends on your financial plans for the next years, Saturn

<Hawkie> yes
<LordDerpington> Nothing with lasers can be bad.

<Kandarihu> I guess your own long-term confidence in the Pound should be a factor as well.
<Om> CrazyCherry: I wouldn't worry about it to much.

<Hawkie> i think you're doing really well :>

*alexxm licks Magical_pablez94 back
<Iron_Edge> AttackWithHugs: That's kool I just want the image. So I can redraw it.

<Magical_pablez94> alexxm: like old times :D
<Cypresswolf|Work> If I could stream :) I would play the worst pony things I could get away with under current rules
<AttackWithHugs> Iron_Edge: http://attackwithhugs.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4vr3sq
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm and Magical_pablez94: What about old times and licking again?
<Scarlet> I'd play an episode of MLP... On audiosurf.
<alexxm> like what Cypresswolf|Work
<Dusty_Nomad> If I was streaming I would play minecraft tf2 CS:S
<Kandarihu> Scarlet: awesome idea.
<TheRainbowDash> Scarlet: That would actually be very interesting.
<Dusty_Nomad> CS: S
<Iron_Edge> AttackWithHugs: And I go!
<Kandarihu> Just ripping the audio and audiosurfing that?
<Dusty_Nomad> and some other games(fucking super meatbot)
<AttackWithHugs> Iron_Edge: Awesomesauce. how much do I owe you?
