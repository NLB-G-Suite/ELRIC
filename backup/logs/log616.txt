<JRP> but you host a server with low ping
<JRP> and not 213213231 ping
<Phase4> 00,02that runs on my home connection
<Phase4> 00,02the one i need for streaming :P
<JRP> yesh

<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, trying to not play it for a bit :P
<Jmo> o-O
<AdamTheDuck> massive performance problems?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02when episodes air, we get a few thousand viewers
<Phase4> 00,02who all refresh at once
<Phase4> 00,02its a little harsh on the server
<killerpony7733> Phase4: If not alot cause some people have unstable connections and all
<AdamTheDuck> I can see that being a problem :/
<Phase4> 00,02when this finishes doing whatever its doing, i'll show you some numbers
<AdamTheDuck> Yay numbers
<Thunder-Crescent> NEW LUNAR REPUBLIC
<AdamTheDuck> FOR LUNA
*AdamTheDuck salutes
<Phase4> 00,02do not use what i'm doing as a guide for setting up websites
<Phase4> 00,02this is hack together make it work
<Phase4> 00,02if you were to actually run the commands i just run you'd be shot
<Phase4> 00,02now, lets use apachebench to simulate, say, 100 users
<Phase4> 00,02hitting the site 1000 times
<AdamTheDuck> I promise not to use this as a guide>_>
<Phase4> 00,02immposibly fast
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02this may take a while
<Kandarihu> You know, the text is hard to read here.
<Phase4> 00,02i know
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Sumica> 00,10phase, are you breaking the server again?
<Phase4> 00,02"Requests per second: 26.37 [#/sec] (mean)"
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, local server, so yes but its ok
<AdamTheDuck> Lol cops are on you Phase :D
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02that number there is the problem, 26 per second
<Sumica> 00,10well at least he's not testing it on the live side server
<Phase4> 00,02would never manage the kinda breakage i need over the internet
<Phase4> 00,02during episodes we get thousands of hits a second
<Phase4> 00,02well, during the stream switch
<Phase4> 00,0226 is a bit small
<Phase4> 00,02hence the performance problem
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try the same thing with a static file
<Phase4> 00,025K Req/s
<Phase4> 00,02limited by the benchmarking app
<Phase4> 00,02it pegged a cpu, rest of them were near idle
<Phase4> 00,02and i forgot where i was going with this
<TheKoreanBrony1354> good morning Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02morning TheKoreanBrony1354

<AdamTheDuck> annnnnnnd back to killing all the Kerbals
<TheKoreanBrony1354> good morning Shortcuit42
<Phase4> 00,02lets try this rocket again
<Shortcircuit42> good afternoon thekoreanbrony1354
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck: Well it's afternoon and around 3 PM here
<Shortcircuit42> 4pm in ol' uk
<Gold_Demona> 9am over here in "sunny" Florida
<Shortcircuit42> What is this monstrosity?
<Gold_Demona> dat game lag
<EonMaster> how is that thing staying upright?
<Gold_Demona> It can't handle the awesome of Phase's rockets
<Major> Dat Kerbal's face XD
<Phase4> 00,02somehow its alive
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut :D
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Phase4: cool rocket
<Gold_Demona> Yeah what EonMaster said, how is it still upright? XD
<Phase4> 00,02magnets
<Major> Phase4: I blame luck :P
<Gold_Demona> Steven Magnets?
<Phase4> 00,02'blame'
<EonMaster> luck, magic, and just a dash of skill
<TheKoreanBrony1354> pha
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Phase4: whats the objective of this game
<Phase4> 00,02go up
<AdamTheDuck> TheKoreanBrony1354: To kill as many Kerbal in the most creative way possible.
<Phase4> 00,02prefferably to space
<AdamTheDuck> Kerbals*
<Phase4> 00,02'in flames' is also an option
<TheKoreanBrony1354> cooleo
<Shortcircuit42> My personal goal is to reach the sun
<EonMaster> something tells me my 2007 laptop would implode trying to start this game
<Phase4> 00,02this might achive kerbin escape
<Phase4> 00,02Shortcircuit42, i've done that :P
<Phase4> 00,02its quite boring actually
<TheKoreanBrony1354> really
<StinkomanFan> SPACE :O
<Shortcircuit42> dat buddingfrienship music
<EonMaster> Pony Kart music :)
<MadSurge> WOOOO
<Shortcircuit42> is iiiiiiit
<Shortcircuit42> whoops
<MadSurge> Videogame musiiiiiic
<DoctoDoctorWho> I muted the chat and put on brodyquest, wow thats catchy. 0_0
<MadSurge> Shortcircuit42: I'm not into MMOs, does it look any good? :D
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02that happened
<Phase4> 00,02this thing can make the mun
<StinkomanFan> Say Hi to Luna for me!
<Shortcircuit42> budding frienship is a harvest moon style pony game :)
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: Adrien Brody, Adrien Bro-dy.
<Sumica> 00,10dafak
<Thunder-Crescent> bro day everyday
<Shortcircuit42> looks good, I harassed the graphics developer for about 2 hours on sunday
<Major> Sumica: Hi :3
<Phase4> 00,02trying to turn this rocket is proving rahter foolish
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i made it launch
<MadSurge> Shortcircuit42: then it might be worthwhile :D
<Phase4> 00,02somehow
<Shortcircuit42> mlp:online is an mmo
<Sumica> 00,10gonna try for torsion gravity?
<EonMaster> you were rolling natural 20s on the takeoff
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: walking to the sun and coming out with an electric guitar, Best Day EVER!
<Shortcircuit42> the developers awarded me the title muffin menace after I attacked kitmit (their spriter) with a muffin
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: and still it's probably his average day (aka all days are best day :D )
<EonMaster> incomming!
<Phase4> 00,02dis will be interesting
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, nah
<TheKoreanBrony1354> nuclear explosion!!!!!!!!!
<EonMaster> nice music choice
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<EonMaster> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02its climbing
<TheKoreanBrony1354> i didnt know rockets could bend
<Sumica> 00,10it broke?
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut xD
<Shortcircuit42> they shouldn't
<Phase4> 00,02this one can hover
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah
<EonMaster> its defying gravity
<TheKoreanBrony1354> cool
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hey its derpy
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: thats an average day on par with the "like a boss" video
<Phase4> 00,02seems to be falling again
<Sumica> 00,10somthing about all those fins and the change to the way air works in .16
<StinkomanFan> CALL THE SEAPONIES!
<AdamTheDuck> Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
<Gold_Demona> This is good falling music
<MadSurge> :D dat monstruosity
<MadSurge> WOOOO
<Phase4> 00,02weeeeeeeeeee
<Gold_Demona> Um..... wut
<MadSurge> WUT :D
<EonMaster> this is rediculous
<TheKoreanBrony1354> dizzy
<StinkomanFan> Takes a while to fall don't it
<AdamTheDuck> lol screw physics
<TheKoreanBrony1354> seems legit
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue what its doing
<MadSurge> Pinkie took over :D
<EonMaster> like how the rocket was falling slower than the shute
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: You have to quit letting Pinkie pilot the rocket. =P
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Pinkie would be the best airpilot ever :D
<Shortcircuit42> This stream is the best stream
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: She'd explode the aircraft... And then explode it again.
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off to bed, goodnight everyone :)
<Jmo> Night AdamTheDuck
<Shortcircuit42> night]
<Gold_Demona> Night AdamTheDuck
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and still, the aircraft would be fine afterwards :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yup
<StinkomanFan> PhasePony will never make it to uranus.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: and then explode it a third time which would somehow put it all back together, how? cuz pinkie
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: LOL Yes, exactly. XD
<StinkomanFan> So.... Phase4's just making a phallic symbol?
<Shortcircuit42> oh no, tripod
<Phase4> 00,02....
<rigid_hoof> im back
<MadSurge> Next Phase4 animations should be doing the Batman glide and falling on his face, or getting into a car from the fifties and crashing into everything :D
<Dr_Arcea> will it fly
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Dr_Arcea, yeah
<MadSurge> Dr_Arcea: but more importantly, will it blend?
<Phase4> 00,02watch
<HiImSpike> Whats up everybrony
<Dr_Arcea> yes :)
<HiImSpike> wooooow
<Kandarihu> What? Your Mag is evolving?
<Kandarihu> Mag has evolved into Lyra
<EonMaster> we have liftoff!
<Sumica> 00,10of dear god wut
<StinkomanFan> FLY PHALLIC SYMBOL
<MadSurge> hello HiImSpike! We're watching Phase4 making impossible rockets
<StinkomanFan> FLY FOR GREAT JUSTICE
<Sumica> 00,10roto rocket is go
<Shortcircuit42> How does that even....
<HiImSpike> thanks MadSurge hows that going
<Sumica> 00,10and I thought the one I got to fly like a helocopter was off the wall
<Gold_Demona> Phase makes rockets only Pinkie can fly
<Phase4> 00,02what this really needs is another stage
<Dr_Arcea> Nice my rocks alwasy crash and burn
<MadSurge> It looks like Pinkie is the pilot, HiImSpike :D
<Phase4> 00,02its clearly not tall enough
<Sumica> 00,10it's fun breaking psysics in kerbal
<Dr_Arcea> rockets
<EonMaster> yeah, needs to be taller
<Sumica> 00,10needs cluster bomb srb's
<Phase4> 00,02in all honesty i cant make it taller
<AJIsAwesome> Good morning, everypony!
<Phase4> 00,02not without hacking save files
<StinkomanFan> Physics? PHYSICS ARE FOR PUSSIES
<Phase4> 00,02morning AJIsAwesome
<EonMaster> well, do it anyways, make Pinkie proud
<Phase4> 00,02if i make the outer rockets detatchable and add a few srb's
<StinkomanFan> Phasepony just doesn't understand why his rocket won't work
<Phase4> 00,02i could totally go to the mun with this
<Dr_Arcea> will it go to the moon and back again
<Phase4> 00,02StinkomanFan, ikr
<Phase4> 00,02Dr_Arcea, not in its current state
<ryaxnb_> hi!
<Dr_Arcea> aw
<Phase4> 00,02actually nvm
<Phase4> 00,02it will probably get to the moon
<EonMaster> would probably crash into the moon
<JRP> Phase4: needs moar kaboom
<Phase4> 00,02just cant land
<StinkomanFan> Look at that sad face on him
<HiImSpike> LOL its pinkies flying bike 3000
<Phase4> 00,02JRP, give it a minute :P
<StinkomanFan> He's so depressed
<Phase4> 00,02i cannot turn this thing
<HiImSpike> you say
<Phase4> 00,02it just cannot be done
<MadSurge> Phase4: youdontsay.jpg
<rigid_hoof> should have added fins
<Shortcircuit42> Somebody needs all the RCS
<StinkomanFan> That KErbal looks overjoyed to be in that flying deathtrap
<HiImSpike> Phase4: are you trying to land your ship on the moon???
<StinkomanFan> As opposed to horrified while in the last one.
<Phase4> 00,02HiImSpike, nope
<StinkomanFan> He already gave Luna her dinner. :)
<HiImSpike> Or missle it to earth directly
<JRP> Phase4: where is it
<Phase4> 00,02?
<JRP> shit buffer
<JRP> now
<JRP> WHY
<JRP> NOW
<MadSurge> WELP TIME TO FALL
<Dr_Arcea> now fire your death beam
<EonMaster> time for an emergency water landing
<StinkomanFan> KErbal is so fucking happy right now
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Gold_Demona> lol falling music
<Phase4> 00,02it ejected its engiens
<Phase4> 00,02'we dont need those'
<HiImSpike> Love how the kerble is smiling
<HiImSpike> LOLOLOLOLOL
<MadSurge> Must be Jebediah
<rigid_hoof> THEY ARE ALL GONNA DIE! just sayen
<MadSurge> WOOO
<HiImSpike> nope
<MadSurge> DESTROYED
<JRP> Phase4: you said kaboom
<HiImSpike> its still going
<StinkomanFan> I wonder what the Kerbal's Sea Program is like...
<HiImSpike> more levels
<Gold_Demona> Moar rockets!
<Shortcircuit42> made a jet boat once
<Phase4> 00,02kaboom's are unplanned
<Phase4> 00,02Shortcircuit42, me too ^_^
<Shortcircuit42> worked pretty well!
<Phase4> 00,02mine broke
<Phase4> 00,02bugger to get them to water
<JRP> Phase4: theres somthing wrong with it
<Shortcircuit42> How do you link peoples names?
<Phase4> 00,02JRP, i know
<Phase4> 00,02it needs more rockets
<Phase4> 00,02Shortcircuit42, press tab
<JRP> Phase4: it dosent have enough rockets
<HiImSpike> Shortcircuit42:
<Shortcircuit42> Phase4: ooh thanks
<StinkomanFan> Play Herbie Hancock! Rockit would fit so WELL with your failures
<Shortcircuit42> Anyone here made a land vehicle to explore kerbin?
<StinkomanFan> Kerbin looks like a boring planet, no wonder they want to go to Luna
<Shortcircuit42> it has trees
<HiImSpike> would laugh if that rocket blew up in the hanger :D
<MadSurge> HiImSpike: can't happen... yet :F
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<rigid_hoof> sweet jesus rockets
<MadSurge> *:D
<Dr_Arcea> that looks awsome
<StinkomanFan> So it has Fluttershys. I have five, maybe six Fluttershies in my yard.
<Flyboy> tactical nuclear destruction?
<StinkomanFan> Fluttershies are not hard to find
<Gold_Demona> Not enough rockets
<HiImSpike> MOOOOOOAAR FUEL
<JRP> i make chiptune stuff
<Flyboy> more nuclear warheads!
<Dr_Arcea> I see bright things in this rockets futcher
<Dr_Arcea> ah spelling
<Sumica> 00,10this can only end in tears
<HiImSpike> or with a bang
<Phase4> 00,02almost done
<StinkomanFan> PhasePony looks so close to crying whenever he fails
<StinkomanFan> It's tragic really
<rigid_hoof> hmmm... nah
<Flyboy> i say we destroy kearth with a tactical nuclear missile and gloat in the face of al the dying and irradiated kerbals while we slowly mutate into superior beings
<JRP> Phase4: needs more rockets
<HiImSpike> Flyboy: naaah that will be tooo easy
<Phase4> 00,02oops
<Flyboy> HiImSpike: oh and i almost forgot. all that... WITHOUT STRUTS
<JRP> ded
<StinkomanFan> TRAGEDY
<rigid_hoof> weeeeellllll
<Dr_Arcea> it was the most perfect rocket ever
<HiImSpike> Flyboy: Now your talking
<EonMaster> that didnt go as planned
<Flyboy> oh hel yeah
<rigid_hoof> what went wrong
<Flyboy> avast octavias plot
<rigid_hoof> oh sweet jesus YES
<MadSurge> ^
<StinkomanFan> everything rigid_hoof
<StinkomanFan> EVERYTHING
<DoctoDoctorWho> lets all hear a woot 4 octy!
<JRP> inb4 booom
<HiImSpike> anyone else getting buffer
<Phase4> 00,02g-force meter is confuse
<Flyboy> what is it?
<Phase4> 00,02HiImSpike, thats probably my connection
<MadSurge> NOONE SURVIVED, NOT EVEN THE CHILDREN
<Phase4> 00,02or yours
<Phase4> 00,02wobble wobble
<HiImSpike> all good:$
<Flyboy> did that say Urill? whats Urill?
<Shortcircuit42> this music is all good
<Shortcircuit42> where is it from?
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Flyboy> imashow you
<Phase4> 00,02ran ouy of fuel
<rigid_hoof> when that rocket reaches 88 milesperhour...
<StinkomanFan> TO LUNA
<Phase4> 00,02Shortcircuit42, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMqmdfKqT5w&feature=autoplay&list=PLE1ED57BE70156AB0&playnext=13
<Flyboy> kk nevermind
<Shortcircuit42> Phase4: thanks, thats awesome
<HiImSpike> Kerbel children... What do you want to be when you grow up. Kid: A Lawyer... Adult: Well you have to be an astronaut because that the only job we have now.
<Flyboy> Phase4: when are you going to make a missile to destroy kearth with?
<rigid_hoof> thou SHALL VISIT LUNA!
<Dr_Arcea> luna or bust
<Sumica> 00,10menus shot?
<Flyboy> fitting music is fitting
<JRP> mica oh my
<Sumica> 00,10celestia song
<HiImSpike> Sumica: You know what the song is???
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, it made it to minmus :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> and the angels sang, and it was good...
<Phase4> 00,02"Makkon befriends Jeffthestrider - Impressions of Celestia Origins "
<rigid_hoof> le* orbit
<HiImSpike> thanks :$
<Sumica> 00,10I see that
<Flyboy> Phase4: is that a sattalite?
<mitamaking> Playing that space game again?
<Sumica> 00,10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqjKLRzA30g
<Phase4> 00,0239 meters/second
<Phase4> 00,02dats a bit slow
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, its intended to land
<Flyboy> you can use that to coordinate where the nuklear missle will strike!
<HiImSpike> its celestias orbitial friendship cannon
<Sumica> 00,10orbtal friendship ion canon
<mitamaking> Time warp?
<Werdna213> whoa
<Werdna213> cool
<DoctoDoctorWho> thats no moon... thats a space station!
<HiImSpike> hey Flyboy I think your though of destroying Kearth is coming true
<Flyboy> >:]
<Sumica> 00,10time to retro burn
<rigid_hoof> WE ARE HERE LUNA
<MaxTheBrony> Heya guys.
<Sumica> 00,10not the mun
<HiImSpike> hey MaxTheBrony
<Flyboy> rigid_hoof: this is minmus, not the mun
<Werdna213> heh
<Sumica> 00,10it's Menmus
<Werdna213> soo
<Flyboy> minmus*
<mitamaking> Man I have not seen you actually take this game seriously ever
<Flyboy> wait a f*cking second...
<MaxTheBrony> Hi HiImSpike :)
<rigid_hoof> wat?
<Flyboy> Werdna213: did you, by any chance. used to play roblox?
<Sumica> 00,10clearly you have not seen me play it mitamaking
<HiImSpike> Marmite
<Werdna213> why yes, yes i did
<Flyboy> Werdna213: its me! payback137!
<Werdna213> oh wow
<mitamaking> Sumica: All I have seen is thousands of ships made to see if they "could" fly
<Sumica> 00,10phase actaly takes his to orbit
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<Dr_Arcea> spaceships were made to fly
<Phase4> 00,02plenty of fuel to spare
<Flyboy> Werdna213: its been too long my freind
<Werdna213> i know how r u doing
<Werdna213> i see your a brony
<Flyboy> Werdna213: i'm doing fine! you?
<Werdna213> just great
<Werdna213> have u still been playing roblox
<Flyboy> Werdna213: NO I'M A HATER LOLZ HAX OMG STOP QUICKSCOPEING YOU MOTHERFCKER!!!!11!!!1
<Phase4> 00,02i forget how little fuel you need to navigate on minmus
<Flyboy> Werdna213: sorry i had to
<Flyboy> Werdna213: i dont really play it that much anymore
<JRP> i did it. i killed manbearpig
<Werdna213> me ether i should tho
<Sylandest> morning, everypony :)
<HiImSpike> Sylandest: How r you
<Flyboy> Werdna213: i normally just watch streams on here or organise an upcoming D&D sesh
<rigid_hoof> manbearpig is gone?!
<Dr_Arcea> morning
<Werdna213> u play d&d
<HiImSpike> heya Dr_Arcea
<Sumica> 00,10nice landing zone
<Dr_Arcea> yes
<Werdna213> i play it on and off
<Sylandest> howdy HiImSpike, and Dr_Arcea. I'm good, a little sleepy
<Flyboy> DUN... DUNDUN.. DUUUN DUN DUN... DUNDUN...
<Sumica> 00,10heavy duity landing struts
<Werdna213> Flyboy:so how r u
<Dr_Arcea> ok good bye
<Werdna213> sorry
<Dr_Arcea> oh wait goond night sorry
<Sumica> 00,10nice parking orbit
<Sumica> 00,10shame you have no rcs
<Flyboy> Werdna213: i'm fine my good pal. juust fine
<Werdna213> so i wonder if there is any fim maps on roblox
<Alchemist> I think this is relevant: http://derpy.me/njrWo
<Phase4> 00,02sea thing is at about zero altitude on minmus
<Phase4> 00,02so i know where it is
<Phase4> 00,02unlike the mun
<Flyboy> Werdna213: definitly. probably not any god ones though
<Werdna213> mybe
<Sumica> 00,10gonna have enough clearnce for the nozzle?
<Werdna213> maybe
<Dr_Arcea> Alchemist its total was relevent
<Dr_Arcea> it made me smile
<Werdna213> so i cant wait for season 3
<JRP> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<JRP> !sumicawig
<rigid_hoof> sonnavabitch
<the_real_pony_1604> look at that yaw control
<Flyboy> yeah. i was offered to go on holiday when it is supposedl piloting but i didnt. my parents were pissed
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, dont know
<Sylandest> the suspense is killer here...
<Sumica> 00,107m/s is damn slow
<Werdna213> so close
<Sumica> 00,10anything below 13 should be safe to land
<Sylandest> aaaand touchdown
<Flyboy> 5
<Flyboy> 4
<Flyboy> 3
<Flyboy> oh wait...
<Flyboy> nvm
<Sylandest> yay!
<Sumica> 00,10nice landing
<Spectrum_Rush> Und dann Phase4 having made it to Minmus, he found something he wasn't expecting... http://derpy.me/dnD4M
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i like landing under 4 m/s
<Werdna213> u made i
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush, D:
<Flyboy> :O
<Sumica> 00,10shame you cant spack walk with that desgine
<EonMaster> now to get back home :D
<Dark_Horst> wait, where the hell is that?
<Phase4> 00,02i broke him
<Sylandest> heheheh
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not actually making him run
<rigid_hoof> discustingly cute
<Sylandest> poor little guy
<Werdna213> is a alien that looks stuck
<Sumica> 00,10time to rcs
<Dr_Arcea> the ship is like lol no your not leaveing
<Phase4> 00,02i cant do anything XD
<Spectrum_Rush> believe me Phase4 I could've gone with a shocker Chryssy image =P
<Flyboy> poor bill
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, cant activate them
<Flyboy> oh hell no
<Flyboy> your not saying....
<Phase4> 00,02and then he ran betwene the wings forever more
<JRP> so does this happen irl?
<rigid_hoof> all this efert and time......
<Phase4> 00,02i can controll the lights
<Werdna213> awwww
<Phase4> 00,02so thats something
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Sumica> 00,10try all controls
<Sylandest> Phase4: can you make him turn at all?
<Shortcircuit42> press r followed by space
<Gold_Demona> Smash all the buttons!
<Werdna213> reset and make a different rocket that is pony themed
<Sumica> 00,10it dont work like that
<Werdna213> its a reascue misson
<Werdna213> oh
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02clearly i must launch a second misson
<Phase4> 00,02fly over there and nudge bill out of the wings
<Werdna213> yes
<Flyboy> i say we nuke him from orbit... just to be sure
<Werdna213> no nukes
<Phase4> 00,02who's up for a second mission
<rigid_hoof> definetly
<Flyboy> Phase4: USE THE POWAH OF A NUKLEAR MISSLE TO KILL HIM!
<Werdna213> 2nd missin
<JRP> Phase4: just make a big death trap rocket
<Flyboy> he'll be fine! just dont touch him in any way
<Werdna213> pinkie pie
<Flyboy> oooh boy..
<Werdna213> i saw a pinke pie rocket save
<rigid_hoof> holu SHIT
<rigid_hoof> *holy
<Dark_Horst> it's a devils device
<Werdna213> well start the countdown
<Dark_Horst> imagine the SHIT you could blow up with this thing
<Flyboy> Phase4: can i request a song?
<Phase4> 00,02lets pretend that launch didnt happen
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, sure
<Dr_Arcea> fly boy thats a nuke
<Flyboy> Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCBXtUNyXPI
<Werdna213> we have liftoff
<Flyboy> two steps from hell will dominate you...
<Flyboy> what...
<Phase4> 00,02and then bob died on earth somehow
<Flyboy> :D
<Phase4> 00,02while still being stuck on minmus
<Werdna213> he phase ever hread of a game called evil genuis
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates August 23rd (Morning)
<Flyboy> i have it
<Werdna213> its a good game
<Flyboy> eeeeeeeeeee- 5 hours later- eeeeeeyup
<Werdna213> we have lift off
<Flyboy> two steps from hell is always fitting
<Werdna213> of coourse it is
<JRP> Phase4: made you look
<Dr_Arcea> you will be their in no time
<Flyboy> erm... is it supposed to be tilting?

<rigid_hoof> dont kill selves
<Phase4> 00,02it better hurry up and move
<Phase4> 00,02missing the transfer window
<Werdna213> well that dosent sound at all good
<Werdna213> i bit says it will crash

<Phase4> 00,02?
<JRP> Phase4: dat red line
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02it looks a few more orbits ahead than the stock config
<Werdna213> fast forward a bit
<Phase4> 00,02it thinks i'm gona orbit minmus, then impact the mun, then leave kerbin gravity
<StinkomanFan> A two manned flight :o
<StinkomanFan> He'll get there eventually
<Sumica> 00,10wait, how did you get 2?
<Shortcircuit42> must ahve ejected somebody
<Sumica> 00,10I dont think you can continue with a man outside
<Dark_Horst> didnt know this version yet. anybody got a link?
<Sumica> 00,10song or game?

<Phase4> 00,02night JRP
<StinkomanFan> CAREFUL SPONGEBOB
<Phase4> 00,02sleep well
<Phase4> 00,02TheMaster, no but i totaly should

<Shortcircuit42> how much ram do you have phase?
<Phase4> 00,0216GB
<Shortcircuit42> Phase4: quad to I assume
<JRP|ZZZZZZZZZ> 8 16
<rigid_hoof> SPOOOOOOOOONGGGGGEBUUUUUBLE!
<Nyst> Ooh, is that Minmus?
<TheMaster> hopefully the makers of kerbel go full star trek with what you can build
<Nyst> But star trek is soft sci-fi.
*JRP|Zzz Zzz
<StinkomanFan> MAKE A TIE FIGHTER NEXT!
<CCCP> soft core sci-fi?
<Flyboy> make a nuclear missle!
<Flyboy> oh and i'm back
<Flyboy> :D
<CCCP> hi Flyboy
<Flyboy> hi CCCP
<Flyboy> ooh yay! TO GLORY!
<rigid_hoof> hero fryboy
<Flyboy> i know all of these songs :)
<Werdna213> flyboy i have a youtube account
<Nyst> Space stations, moon bases etc fine. Warp engines no.
*Maid_Rainbow hugs CCCP
<Flyboy> kk, ima subscribe to it
<CCCP> hi Maid_Rainbow
<Werdna213> add me
*CCCP hugs back
<StinkomanFan> We're not Saving Luna, we're feeding her.
*Maid_Rainbow nuzzles CCCP
<TheMaster> fine, no warp engines. but moon bases, space stations and maybe extra planets to visit would be cool
<Phase4> 00,02problem wiht minmus is that its very easy to start going up again
<CCCP> yeah bye
<StinkomanFan> HERE LUNA, GET THE NUMMY NUMMY KERBALS
<Phase4> 00,02TheMaster, extra planets are my most wanted feature
<Nyst> I don't know anything about Minmus. Is the gravity there lower then on Mun?
<AJIsAwesome> Maid_Rainbow: Hello!
<rigid_hoof> mmmmmmmm taysth kerbals
<rigid_hoof> taysty*
<Spectrum_Rush> StinkomanFan: this is minmus not mun luna is not here, someone else is though
<Maid_Rainbow> AJIsAwesome : hello there
*Jmo tackles Vivix
<Nyst> The second they add another planet you'll see people doing gravity slingshots.
<Vivix> Phase4 stream!
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<Vivix> Hii Jmo
<Jmo> Haaaai Vivix :3
<TheMaster> you can't do that with the sun?
<Nyst> Maybe? I dunno. But where would you go?
<Vivix> is he landing on the moon?
<Spectrum_Rush> minmus
<Maid_Rainbow> mum
<StinkomanFan> CANGRATURATION
<StinkomanFan> YOU MADE IT TO URANUS
<Spectrum_Rush> MINMUS
<MegaMoonShine> Hi again dudes :)
<StinkomanFan> Same thing
<Vivix> Wow, this game has updated a lot since I played it
<rigid_hoof> easyyy
<Jmo> Hai MegaMoonShine
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<StinkomanFan> CARE
<StinkomanFan> FUL
<TheMaster> and we have touchdown
<MegaMoonShine> Wow he did it! :O
<Phase4> 00,02363 meters away
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: you've angered the queen with your countless visit, http://derpy.me/9fDaC run RUN FOR YOUR LIFE D8
<TheMaster> now how to rescue our fellow cosmakerbels?
<Nyst> I suppose that, even with it's low gravity, you could still sling around Mun to make it to Minmus with less fuel.
<StinkomanFan> Yaaaaaaaaay!
<Phase4> 00,02not particuarly close but considering i traversed space
<rigid_hoof> bueno....
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush, Argh
<Vivix> Phase4: Niiice
<Phase4> 00,02wow
<Werdna213> time to reascue
<Phase4> 00,02was not expecting that Spectrum_Rush
<EonMaster> all she needs is a hug
<rigid_hoof> gah!
<JRP|Zzz> bye
<Vivix> Chrysalis <3
<Flyboy> protectors of the kearth
<Sumica> 00,10wait, this is a resque ship?
<MegaMoonShine> Protectors of the Kerbin
<Vivix> Oh man, I gotta get the update of this game-
<Spectrum_Rush> I sorry Phase4 :(, i did warn ya before though
<Flyboy> phew... i thought he was stuck then
<mitamaking> And he dies on the moon
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Sumica> 00,10wow, low gravity
<Nyst> Yeah
<StinkomanFan> FLY KERBAL
<StinkomanFan> FLY
<Nyst> Really low
<mitamaking> Is he stuck?
<Sumica> 00,10so you go ram the other poor bastard loose or just jack his ride
<rigid_hoof> they are both gonna get stuck...
<Phase4> 00,02crap
<Phase4> 00,02wrong button
<MegaMoonShine> Uhh... where is he supposed to be? Is this a mod?
<Flyboy> :D
<Phase4> 00,02i needed to press a different button
<Sumica> 00,10woops
<EonMaster> well now
<TheMaster> uh houston. we have two kerbels stuck
<TheMaster> send another ship
<Werdna213> WHY DIDNT U DO THAT THE FRIST TIME
<Nyst> So what happened here? How did they get stuck there?
<Flyboy> uh houston. we need a tow, pronto
<rigid_hoof> naild it
<Sumica> 00,103 if you count the one in the other ship
<Vivix> Walking spaceship
<Phase4> 00,02the galoping space capsules of minmus
<mitamaking> How is that moving?
<Flyboy> mitamaking: magic
<Nyst> The capsule should have wheels on it :)
<rigid_hoof> magic
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: defender of earth?
<Sumica> 00,10gyros are magic
<Shortcircuit42> Nyst: my attempts at making a landable car has been difficult
<Flyboy> Dark_Horst: ah, i see that i'm not the only lover of TSFH
<TheMaster> now if you can just build up enough inertia you should be able to break the gravity of minmus
<Dark_Horst> lol. the capsule can walk
<Flyboy> TO GLORY!
<EonMaster> time to explore minmus
<Nyst> Can't you just add landing gear to the capsule itself?
<Sumica> 00,10it's a space qwopsle
<Dark_Horst> Flyboy: i'd be disappointed if you were
<mitamaking> Send the 3rd kerbal to fix this
<Werdna213> this is a rescue misson
<StinkomanFan> So Phase4 you got to Minmus and saves some dude from dying alone. What are you gonna do now?
<TheMaster> they'll edit this part out of the movie
<MegaMoonShine> lol
<Sumica> 00,10now they can die together
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Vivix> Imagine all the vomit in that capsule-
<Nyst> You move like the tentacles from day of the tentacle do.
<VenHur> Hi guys, we're watching some KSP?
<Phase4> 00,02now i might try nudging that ship
<Phase4> 00,02with my ship
<MegaMoonShine> Hi VenHur :)
<Sumica> 00,10so you gonna go knock the other guy off the wing?
<rigid_hoof> has anypony here seen the grand galloping collab?
<mitamaking> That's all you can do now isn't it
<Spectrum_Rush> do eet
<Dark_Horst> this one would fit better for takeoffs^^
<AJIsAwesome> rigid_hoof: I have.
<VenHur> Wait, wait, WAIT. Is that the moon?! HAWLY SHEET!
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: how do you steer his thrusters?
<EonMaster> which song is this?
<rigid_hoof> nice AJ
<StinkomanFan> VenHur, no it's URANUS
<Nyst> VenHur: it's the SECOND moon!
<TheMaster> what you need is iron man to save the day
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, magic
<Sumica> 00,10why not bump him with kerble
<Dark_Horst> EonMaster: to glory by two steps from hell
<EonMaster> thx
<Dr_Arcea> this game with co-op would be fun
<mitamaking> Your fuel will run out before getting to Earth at this rate
<TheMaster> epseically if they added lasers
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: retrezct the landing gear so you dont damage when bump
<TheMaster> space duels
<Sumica> 00,10it's called moonbase alpha Dr_Arcea
<Werdna213> opperation nudge is a go
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know what i'm doing
<Dark_Horst> mitamaking: capsule duels. it'd be like smashing eggs together to see which one survives
<Sumica> 00,10no RCS again I see
<Nyst> aeoiuaeoiuaeoiu
<TheMaster> you're doing the most scientifically precise thing you can
<VenHur> Welp, we're on the moon, but where's Woona?
<Sumica> 00,10shame cause you could lateral with that
<Dark_Horst> mitamaking: whoops, wrong ping
<mitamaking> Phase4: Don't say that when you are on the moon
<Sumica> 00,10not the mun.
<Spectrum_Rush> VenHur: not the moon, Minmus
<Phase4> 00,02good thing i'm on minmus
<Sumica> 00,10this is the other satelight minmus
<TheMaster> so the kerbel is stuck on the spaceship?
<TheMaster> is he dead?
<mitamaking> Maybe if his head wasn't so big
<Nyst> That is some really, really fine control.
<Shortcircuit42> probably soon....
<Werdna213> roflol at the music to whats going on
<Nyst> I'm jealous! Compared to this I steer my rockets like a drunken whale!
<Sumica> 00,10some realy good fine controll seeing as he is useing just gimbls and gyros
<TheMaster> now entering orbit
<mitamaking> Are you leaving him?
<Werdna213> i whould like to see that
<Dr_Arcea> i am gooing to play moon base alpha is it any good
<TheMaster> its good with people
<Nyst> The game could really use a grappling hook or magnetic hook.
<TheMaster> and microsoft sam engaged
<Nyst> It's good fun for a few times. It's really realistic.
<Jmo> Vivix b busy? o:
<Dr_Arcea> awsome
<Sumica> 00,10Nyst, there are some videos of people using landing struts as claws
<Nyst> It's also very slow and repetitive, but that's to be expected from something realistic.
<Nyst> Sumica: people are amazing.
<Kammerjunk> Phase, you're rousing up your stream and launch those kerbals hard! 'Cause Hell broke loose in BronyState, and ChanServ deals the cards!
<mitamaking> Nyst: Well how many times do people go to a satellite of their planet?
<Vivix> Jmo what now?
<Sumica> 00,10guy grabs another pod using the struts and take both the grab pod and the grashed pod backe to kerth
<TheMaster> brace for it
<Jmo> You're quiet so it seems that you're busy.
<Jmo> o.O
<Nyst> Sumica: got a link?
<Wrek> 05i has teh bored, suggestions?
<Nyst> or a name
<TheMaster> old dr.who
<Sumica> 00,10not off hand no
<mitamaking> Wrek: wait for the crash
<Vivix> Sumica niiice- man I only have the old version without..anything really
<rigid_hoof> oh god wat are u doing
<Sumica> 00,10Wrek, arts =p
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: F:NV?
<Vivix> Jmo oh no, I'm just chilling, reading and stuff
<Wrek> 05FNV is tempting
<Kammerjunk> Perfect music.
<Jmo> Oh fair enough o.o
<TheMaster> oh gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
<TheMaster> here it comes
<mitamaking> oh no
<Nyst> Oh god. Imagine this. Landing vessels, designed in such a way what each next lander can land ON TOP of the other. Make a massive tower of landers!
<killerpony7733> Wrek: MVM maybe?
<Kammerjunk> Nyst: Oh my.
<MadSurge> SO EPIC
<Sumica> 00,10oh god
<MegaMoonShine> This can only end well
<Nyst> Each lander hooks into the one below it, making it a massive rocket again.
<StinkomanFan> NO,NO,NOOOOOO
<Phase4> 00,02crap
<rigid_hoof> nooooooooooooo
<Jmo> Whatchu reading Vivix o.o
<StinkomanFan> ABANDON SHIP
<rigid_hoof> lol
<mitamaking> save it save it
<VenHur> Wrek: Hm... Doctor Who?
<Kammerjunk> MVM is fun, but I have to password protect it so people don't join before I do.
<Phase4> 00,02man, some rcs would be nice
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: We got phases servers if we want to play
<Vivix> Was reading "What Princesses Need" Jmo, but now I'm just browsing. Going to save the update for FOE Heroes until later
<Sumica> 00,10Phase4, why dont you bump him with the other kerble instead?
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Orly?
<Nyst> Just over half a tank of fuel left.
<Jmo> That's a good one Vivix.
<mitamaking> The fuel has me really worried
<Vivix> Yeah, pretty funny, and serious
<Jmo> Indeed
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Yep one of his servers currently which is the only i can see is up
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02i have idea
<Kammerjunk> Ideeeeaaaaaa!
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, dont want them both getting stuck
<TheMaster> tractor beam?
<rigid_hoof> do idea
<mitamaking> Phase4: That is a bad idea
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i have the debris set to 0
<VenHur> So like yesterday, we'll has another Rifftrax.
<Sumica> 00,10should be ok if he has his pack on.
<VenHur> *have
<Sumica> 00,10it might remove the ship if the pod is gone from it.
<mitamaking> This music just makes this so intense
<Sumica> 00,10good thinking
<Kammerjunk> mitamaking: This.
<rigid_hoof> very slow but intence
<mitamaking> rigid_hoof: Very realistic if this really happened
<StinkomanFan> You have two kerbals. In a kerban society they ship them to the mun for no other reason than to show they're better than you.
<MadSurge> YESHHHH
<VenHur> It sounded like something out of LoTR...
<rigid_hoof> lol yup
<mitamaking> StinkomanFan: I thought you had 3
<Phase4> 00,02DAMNIT
<Nyst> So now we build a rescue ship to rescue the rescue ship?
<Sumica> 00,10time for third resque ship equiped with rcs
<Kammerjunk> This will be fun.
<TheMaster> soon you'll have a whole colony
<TheMaster> of ships needing rescue
<Flyboy> Sumica: or we could nuke the planet from orbit... just to be sure
<mitamaking> can he wiggle his way out
<Kammerjunk> How was he going home with just half a tank fuel, anyway?
<Nyst> Try equipping your third ship with a grappling hook made out of landing gear!
<StinkomanFan> And so eventually all of Kerban Society went to Minmus
<Sumica> 00,10still think the other guy could bump him out if he stays in rcs mode
<TheMaster> you need to send jebediah kerbel
<EonMaster> if at first you dont succeed, throw more stuff at it until you do
<TheMaster> Jebediah can save the day
<Nyst> Can EVA'd kerbals run out of jetpack fuel?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's refilled when they dock
<lowfn|> Hello everypony and what be this
<Nyst> Ah.
<StinkomanFan> I can only imagine the kerbal scientests getting so pissed off right now
<mitamaking> I guess I will ask, how did it get stuck?
<TheMaster> ram the ship with his body!
<Kammerjunk> lowfn|: Phase's playing that Kerbal game.
<Nyst> I can't get over just how low the gravity there is. Is that moon made out of sponge?
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 stuck #2
<MegaMoonShine> Hello lowfn| :)
<TheMaster> death
<Kammerjunk> wat
<mitamaking> concussion
<StinkomanFan> tap
<Flyboy> trolololololololol
<VenHur> I wish we get more updates to this in the near future, i'm interested to see several citys Kerbal'ed, plus better texturing.
<Sumica> 00,10bonk
<Kammerjunk> Did he just spin around?
<CCCP> :(
<Werdna213> :'(
<Nyst> Jump on top of his head!
<lowfn> Man this game looks fun.
<rigid_hoof> there gonna get stuck......
<mitamaking> This may work
<Flyboy> yes? YYES?
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02shit
<mitamaking> slide!!!
<Werdna213> yes
<TheMaster> victory!
<EonMaster> lol
<MegaMoonShine> Yes!
<mitamaking> yay
<lowfn> SEY!
<Flyboy> DUN DUN DUUUN
<rigid_hoof> YESH
<Werdna213> YES
<Phase4> 00,02i saved bill
<VenHur> EXCELLENT
<TheMaster> or did the other kerbel get stuck?
<Sumica> 00,10yay
<StinkomanFan> You still have that other kerbal right?
<EonMaster> is the other kerbal stuck now?
<Gold_Demona> ...So now you have TWO stuck Kerbals?
<Phase4> 00,02now cammy is stuck
<Nyst> Did the other one get stuck?
<Flyboy> epic win music
<mitamaking> WAT?
<Sumica> 00,10lawl
<Spectrum_Rush> CALLED IT
<Nyst> Pfff hahahahaa
<Kammerjunk> lowfn: SUOICILED SI SIHS!
<CCCP> wth is a kerbal?
<TheMaster> the magic of kerbel friendship will save the day
<Kammerjunk> SIHT* goddammit
<Sumica> 00,10the little green guys
<VenHur> Yay, Bill Cosby is saved! Now let's go down the slope going Zip Zop Boopedy BOP!
<Gold_Demona> CCCP: The little astronaut dudes are Kerbals
<StinkomanFan> "I'm up, I'm up."
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: This is a Kerbal.
<Nyst> Kerbals are the astronauts here.
<mitamaking> Doesn't look stuck
<CCCP> oh
<lowfn> Kammerjunk: Sey
<Flyboy> if only they could pick other kerbals up
<Nyst> Now /dance
<mitamaking> Switch kerbals and check
<CCCP> ty Gold_Demona Kammerjunk
<EonMaster> yay
<TheMaster> success!
<mitamaking> YES
<Gold_Demona> No problem CCCP
<Flyboy> YEEEEES
<lowfn> SSECCUS!
<EonMaster> now to get all 3 kerbals bak to kerbin
<Sumica> 00,10awsome
<Werdna213> misson succes
<mitamaking> Sorry mission control, the problem is fixed
<TheMaster> you can stop building rocket #3 now
<Sumica> 00,10see phase
<mitamaking> So who were you rescuing
<Flyboy> Wait a sec... GOD DAMN IT JEREMIAH! YOU LEFT THE ENGINE RUNNING!
<Sumica> 00,10the one stuck on the fins
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, thta'S the song used for the my little battletech loading screen
<Gold_Demona> Anyone else singing Tobuscus' lyrics to this song?
<Sumica> 00,10who>
<Nyst> I love the way they waddle.
<Gold_Demona> Robot insect aliens~ Not to be confused with ladybugs~ Shoot at the ground~
<mitamaking> Time to go home
<StinkomanFan> So all three of them are safe now?
<Shortcircuit42> MY LITTLE BATTLETECH?!
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<TheMaster> they have to return to kerth
<Nyst> Is there room for three in that capsule?
<Sumica> 00,10I think this might be a first
<Shortcircuit42> Dark_Horst: Tell me more
<Dark_Horst> Shortcircuit42: wait a second
<Flyboy> Phase4: as you arent going to use it afterwards, can you nuke the left over spaceship?
<StinkomanFan> inb4 they die coming home
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Now we must get the kerbals back to kerbin!
<TheMaster> hopefully there is enough fuel
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Sumica> 00,10one mission coming back with crew from another
<Nyst> Looks like there's room.
<VenHur> Kerbals, write a letter to the Princess!
<Phase4> 00,02seems kerbin is tidally locked too
<Werdna213> we have retrived the stuck one and are now coming home
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, for bronystate yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica I have seen a rescue mission before
<Phase4> 00,02ONWARD
<Sumica> 00,10same here Barbetos|AtWork
<StinkomanFan> FOR GREAT JUSTICE
<Nyst> Phase4: While that might be deliberate; chances are it's just something that's not implemented yet.
<mitamaking> Why did you have to send another ship to save him?
<Werdna213> AND CUPCAKES
<VenHur> AND MUFFINS
<MegaMoonShine> FOR EQUESTRIA!
<Flyboy> AND TSFH!
<StinkomanFan> mitamaking, the other one was out of fuel and he was stuck in the fins
<Flyboy> oh hell yeah
<Nyst> Half a tank of fuel...WILL THEY MAKE IT?
<Sumica> 00,10he was stuck in the fins mitamaking
<VenHur> FOR NARNI-I mean...EQUESTRIA
<StinkomanFan> TAKE OFF EVERY ZIG
<Flyboy> best music for the return trip
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, what might be?
<lowfn> /)_(\
<mitamaking> StinkomanFan: What about the other two kerbals with him or was it a solo mission
<Nyst> Phase4: the planet being tidally locked.
<Gold_Demona> MOVE ZIG
<Werdna213> whats the eta
<StinkomanFan> mitamaking Solo
<Dark_Horst> Shortcircuit42: there was a (quite good, imo) fafic that crossovered mechwarrior and mlp. somebody liked it so much that he made a concept of how a loading screen of a crossover game could look like
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<TheMaster> for great justice
<Sumica> 00,10he was solo in a small pod
<mitamaking> StinkomanFan: of course he got stuck
<Sumica> 00,10this is a 3man pod
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, no, rotation is implimented
<Shortcircuit42> Dark_Horst: thanks for the info!
<Sumica> 00,10seems he kickd one out on the pad though
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, its just that both moons are tidally locked
<Nyst> Phase4: interesting.
<TheMaster> dark side of the mun?
<Sumica> 00,10needs some major tom
<TheMaster> Space Oddity by David Bowie plz
<MegaMoonShine> Do it!
<Nyst> Okay so this is the bit I don't understand.
<VenHur> DO IT
<mitamaking> What have you learned abut solo missions?
<Phase4> 00,02didnt even touch the outer tanks
<Nyst> How to get the trajectory of the rocket to be so, that the rocket and the planet cross each other at the exact same time.
<Phase4> 00,02mitamaking, always have a spare rocket incase shit breaks
<TheMaster> math
<TheMaster> and magic
<Sumica> 00,10it caculates alot of that
<rigid_hoof> alright evry pony its been pleasent but i must bid farwell
<Werdna213> on reentry u should play smile smile smile
<Sumica> 00,10some of it you just play by ear
<MegaMoonShine> Later rigid_hoof :)
<TheMaster> pahse4 could do the calculus himself
<TheMaster> but then that wouldn't be very fun
<Sumica> 00,10like if you are going to the mun
<TheMaster> if one of you have silent hunter that could be a fun game to stream
<mitamaking> TheMaster: Sure it would
<Werdna213> or lunas theme
<Nyst> How does he know the planet will be there? All it shows is a blue line.
<Sumica> 00,10you orbet kerblin and just as the mun is riseing you burn at it.
<Werdna213> or hers sisters
<mitamaking> This looks like a good place to land
<Sumica> 00,10when the line changes to yellow he has an intercept corce set
<Nyst> Is it going to overshoot?
<Sumica> 00,10red is a colision
<TheMaster> do they have a exosphere on kerbin?
<Sumica> 00,10woops
<Nyst> Oh that is NICE!
<mitamaking> what line?
<Rustymeat> Oh mai
<killerpony7733> And now gravity takes him in
<Rustymeat> inb4 horrible crash
<TheMaster> no resistance from the atmosphere?
<Phase4> 00,02might be a bit fast
<Sumica> 00,10there is resistance but no friction
<Nyst> Next he'll make a perfect landing on the launch platform. Wouldn't surprise me.
<mitamaking> Man where are the rockets going to land
<StinkomanFan> Like the ending of Two Thousand One
<Nyst> mitamaking: you can track those
<Phase4> 00,02nvm, seem to be slowing
<Sumica> 00,10they will explode on impact
<Werdna213> i bet 5 bits for a splashdown
<Sumica> 00,10the rockets that is
<Flyboy> Phase4: SPIN
<mitamaking> splashdown is best down in this case
<Sumica> 00,10he will know where he will land if he zooms out
<Nyst> Kerbals like to put explosives in everything. Anything without a parachute to slow it's decent will explode.
<Flyboy> Phase4: the kerbal in the middle "some kerbals just want to watch the world burn"
<Sumica> 00,10including kerbals
<Phase4> 00,02thats jeb
<TheMaster> football mode
<Phase4> 00,02he's always like that
<Flyboy> figures
<Nyst> Actually, even the parachute has explosives in it.
<MegaMoonShine> You spin me right round
<mitamaking> Flyboy: HE's just happy not to be stuck on the moon anymore
<TheMaster> Jeb has no fear
<{CapTaIn}MasterBoss> Do you think my name is a noob name?
<Kammerjunk> Dearly, my frank, I don't damn a give.
<StinkomanFan> JEB FEARS NOPONY
<Phase4> 00,02very calm re-entry this one
<Sumica> 00,10snap
<TheMaster> should put some more 420s and 'noscopes'
<mitamaking> Sumica: don't joke
<TheMaster> and xXx
<Nyst> Very classic sideways reentry.
<Sumica> 00,10he's done it before
<mitamaking> dang
<Sumica> 00,10big chute is twice the force at half the tensile
<{CapTaIn}MasterBoss> I think i am changing name to MilkyWhiskers, but who else has {CapTaIn} before his name? (It is a clan name yes)
<Flyboy> it looks like its orbiting 0.0
<Nyst> Yeah the parachute icon is yellow.
<TheMaster> a pony clan?
<Sumica> 00,10yelow meens midphase deployed
<Kammerjunk> {CapTaIn}MasterBoss: No one I've seen.
<Werdna213> it better open
<Sumica> 00,10landing strust go yellow too when in mid opening
<{CapTaIn}MasterBoss> TheMaster, yes and no but i am recruiting real pro gamerz
<Sumica> 00,10chute will fully open around 500m
<killerpony7733> ^Hahahahaha
<TheMaster> uh, I don't think this is that kind of stream
<{CapTaIn}MasterBoss> Kammerjunk that is what i mean XD
<Nyst> Ah. I thought it meant they were under greater then average stress.
<mitamaking> Where is your speed?
<mitamaking> good
<MegaMoonShine> Trees everywhere!
<Nyst> Above the blue circle.
<Shortcircuit42> hopefully the parachute won't detach
<Sumica> 00,10speed is above the ball
<{CapTaIn}Milky> Testing 1234
<StinkomanFan> KERBAL SHALL LIVE
<{CapTaIn}Milky> Yesh

<Biglaw> ohai everypony!
<MegaMoonShine> ohai Biglaw :)
<Dovah> Werdna213: she is a goul
<MLP_Brovakiin> Werdna213: She is a ghoul
<lowfn> Werdna213: Drugs
<Werdna213> define goul in this game
<Biglaw> Wrek is playing FANV?
<Dovah> i knew i forgot a letter somewhere
<Biglaw> or FA3?
<Dovah> NV
<Dark_Horst> Biglaw: nv
<Biglaw> okay
<MegaMoonShine> Does that music play every time he pulls the gun out?
<Dovah> MegaMoonShine: yes
<MLP_Brovakiin> Werdna213: Someone who has been exposed to too much radiation
<MegaMoonShine> That's pretty cool :D
<Werdna213> oh
<lowfn> Dovah: Why
<Golakka> Why does a revolver sound like a god dammed cannon?
<Werdna213> ouch
<Dovah> lowfn: because that is an epic gun..
<lowfn> Dovah: Makes sense.
<Dark_Horst> Golakka: you never heard a magnum revolver fire before, did you?
<SirGanjalf> hello
<RaveBrony> o_o
<lowfn> Hai SirGanjalf
<CCCP> hi SirGanjalf
<SirGanjalf> Is this the regular FNV or some DLC
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo SirGanjalf
<SirGanjalf> ?
<Golakka> Ive heard a few types of weapon fire, but being a brifag, those are few and far between
<Dark_Horst> hunting shotgun. loved it in nv. less a gun, more a multipurpose tool of death and destruction
<killerpony7733> SirGanjalf: Regular and most likely with DLC on it
<desertman2> This is a vanilla area
<Dark_Horst> especially with the shotgun surgeon perk and gun runners arsenal addon
<RaveBrony> O_O
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ma leeegs
<EonMaster> O.o
<Werdna213> o_O
<SirGanjalf> It reminds of that Hotel from "Shining"6_9
<Biglaw> My Legs!
<lowfn> This is a random phrase that you have just read.
<SirGanjalf> Master's Army? Dat first Fallout reference.
<Major> Wrek: do you have any idea why music plays when you pull out that pistol? :P
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Oi have you updated your tribes as of late?
<Werdna213> GIANT BUGS
<lowfn> Major: Sounds like the Mysterious Stranger perk sound.
<Biglaw> pop
<Wrek> 05i sense cazadores nearby
<Pyroid> i've had pet mantises...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Major: It is a rare item, the mystterious magnum
<MLP_Brovakiin> *mysterious
<Major> MLP_Brovakiin: ah okay :P
<Dark_Horst> i found cazadors surprisingly easy to kill with a shotgunn skilled character
<Major> Wrek: so did you ever look for the Holy Hand Grenades in this game? :P
<killerpony7733> They are generally easy to kill. But hell they are annoying
<SirGanjalf> cazadores = poachers?
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: if cazadors are easy to kill, you picked the wrong difficulty
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: they're usually worse than deathclaws
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Depends on how you spec and what weapons you pick
<desertman2> Old World Blues makes them much easier to kill
<Gold_Demona> SirGanjalf: cazador is the Spanish word for "hunter", some of which could also be poachers. =P
<Biglaw> I wish I had FA NV or FA3 :I
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733 shotgun surgeon, upgraded hunting shotgun and magnum rounds work
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: what did you use?
<SirGanjalf> oh, thx Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> No problem
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Mostly gatling laser or with the gun runners arsenal gatling laser/plasma gun
<Maid_Rainbow1> well everypony i have to go
<Maid_Rainbow1> bye bye
<MegaMoonShine> Bye Maid_Rainbow1 :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Maid_Rainbow1
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: I mostly go energy weapons
<Biglaw> bai maid...
<CCCP> :D
<Biglaw> :(
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: problem is, gatlings are usually effective middle to late game. cazadors are everywhere
<SirGanjalf> killerpony7733: Same here.
<Biglaw> To hay with these russian duck face ads
<CCCP> We are the champions my friends!
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Still don't have a huge problem with em. TBH
<Gold_Demona> Well, I gotta be a good house wife and go clean the house. I'll see y'all later. :P
<Dark_Horst> though the day i found the avenger gatling, there wasnt really any enemy that gave me trouble
<CCCP> Biglaw Russian Duck Face > American Duck face

<Werdna213> rolling on floor luaghing out loud
<Major> GilDash|Gaming: No I mean the "hunters" :P
<killerpony7733> Werdna213: I'm well aware what that mean
<Dark_Horst> i like how obsidian was too lazy to implement ammo for the flare gun and made it use flamer fuel instead
<Werdna213> ok just in case not all people do
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wrek:Now go and kill the Legendary Deathclaw :D
<GilDash|Gaming> Major: I don't know what you're on about. :S

<Major> Saturn: Oh my O////o
<Biglaw> Saturn: Your opinion on duck faces? >.>
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: it's an encounter though, chances are it bugs and the corpses along with the main pack dont show up. save and reload should fix that, though then you might find yourself surrounded by deathclaws. lots of them
<Dark_Horst> happened to me
<lowfn> Saturn: Are there any other changelings? 6_9

<Dark_Horst> Werdna213: they're part of a military organization that fled to an oilrig when the bombs fell. isolated from the rest of the wasteland and it'S mutation they had this idea that for civilization to rise again, only pure, unmutated humans must be allowed to live
<Dark_Horst> Werdna213: ergo, they're evil purists
<CCCP> Say, what’s in this drink?
<Werdna213> ahhhhhh

<pony_4484> I havent read my little dashie. i heard it breaks your soul and makes you sad forever. xD thats how sad it is
<Werdna213> i have never read cupcakes but with the reviews and comments its been getting i dont know if i want to
<rdash> ^
<Biglaw> CCCP what?
<pony_4484> I liked cupcakes ^^
<Hackalot> I can't wait to see the outcome either...but like I said...I really want to read fanfics on my iPod Touch 4G and then save them for Offline Reading later
<AJIsAwesome> Biglaw: Same here. It's a great fanfic, but I didn't cry at all. I was sad, though.
<Biglaw> ^
<MLP_Brovakiin> pony_4484: WHAT O_o
<CCCP> people that liked cupcakes only like it so they can feel cool, its a bad fic even for Grim Dark ones
<Dovah> read mld then cupcakes
<Werdna213> i didnt cry ether but i was sad, it felt like my hreat was crying
<Biglaw> Apparantly I sound like microsoft sam when I talk 0.o
<Major> O_O?
<Hackalot> I did the other way around...Cupcakes then MLD
<pony_4484> ^^ nah. i just like violence.
<AJIsAwesome> Hackalot: Sorry, I can't help with that.:( You can ask some other people, though.
<Dovah> it works
<CCCP> pony_4484 my point made :3
<pony_4484> Happy tree friends is worse than cupcakes. 0-0
<Biglaw> pony_4484: that show is awful
<pony_4484> Its funny though
<CCCP> happy tree friends is funny for the shock but thats all
<Biglaw> ;A;
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am cool with violence, but I could never bring my self to mix it with MLP
<Hackalot> Also I just happen to be on Ponychat IRC on my Chromebook!
<pony_4484> ^^ lumpy is an idiot. he always gets everyone killed
<CCCP> lumpy is my hero
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Same here. I can never see that happen IMO.
<Werdna213> never seen happy tree friends and never will
<pony_4484> Flippy is my hero >:)
<Dovah> honestly i would rather watch cupcakes then read it, thats how fuck up my mind is
<CCCP> lets talk about Christmas :)
<Hackalot> *shivers* can we just drop the subject please?
*CCCP hugs pony_4484
<pony_4484> sweet apple massacre was just fucked up.
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: No, you're not f***** up. You're just different, and that's fine by me.:)
<Biglaw> Dovah well there's a flash animation on newgrounds of it -.-
<Werdna213> what about the season 2 wedding episodie
<pony_4484> the flash wasnt bad.
<AJIsAwesome> I wouldn't read gorefics, but if you read them that's fine.
<Dovah> AJIsAwesome: my sister laughed at cupcakes... and she's 10...
<Werdna213> wtf
<Dovah> she IS fucked up
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: Did you ask her why?
<Biglaw> AJIsAwesome: what....
<pony_4484> when people reacted to the royal wedding it was weird...
<Biglaw> Dovah derp
<AJIsAwesome> Biglaw: What do you mean?
<CCCP> Dovah why did you let your sister read cupcakes? WTF
<pony_4484> people were all like: OMG WTF BBQ ZOMG
<Hackalot> Anypony else know some good Pony stuff to put on my iPod Touch...FYI It's Jailbroken
<pony_4484> Thats like the time derpy was introduced
<Biglaw> AJIsAwesome: I meant that to go to Dovah, I derped when I read the person who said it
<Buytoast> well the hacksaw joke was pretty funny
<Buytoast> you have to admit
<pony_4484> yeah
<Dr_Arcea> well i have one hold on
<Dovah> CCCP: I didnt! i mentioned mlp then she said when she was on youtube she watched it 3 times...
<AJIsAwesome> I do have to say, Cupcakes has become way too popular. Most non-bronies become haters because Cupcakes is a popular video on Youtube
<pony_4484> Story of the blanks wasnt THAT bad...
<Dr_Arcea> this is a good brony song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk
<CCCP> Dovah O_o
<Biglaw> pony_4484: I read a story called Frienship is Tragic, that made me cry
<CCCP> pony_4484: why you no hug back? :[
<AJIsAwesome> Dr_Arcea: Sorry, no video links during stream.

<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: It would be stupid not to accept that.

<Werdna213> how about Pony In A Box Productions
<YourLittleDashie> OMG prepare your hearts: http://derpy.me/87Fxp

<LadyFluxum> I can finally complete a part of my childhood
<MaxTheBrony> LadyFluxum on LoL?
<Flootahshy> Hey everypony. I see we are speedpainting.

<MegaMoonShine> Hey Flootahshy :)

<LadyFluxum> MegaMoonShine: Yeah, they made a kickstarter apparently. Same game, better graphics, aslo freeroaming
<Flootahshy> MaxTheBrony: It's not? Wha?
<Alchemist> Its not speedpainting, Wrek is just this awesome :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Flootahshy

<MaxTheBrony> haha :P
<StinkomanFan> AJ is Awesome, actually Zecora's the Demoman and Spike is soldier.
<MaxTheBrony> Takes one hour just to make a line
<MegaMoonShine> That's cool LadyFluxum :)
<Alchemist> Havent played any Myst games
<LadyFluxum> Alchemist: Riven is the one and only if you plan to do so
<LadyFluxum> Just.... keep a piece of pen and paper net to you

<Alchemist> LadyFluxum: sounds good, been tired of the no brainer shootemups and hack em ups anyways :)
<MaxTheBrony> ded?
<killerpony7733> I wish i had someone to play Tribes Ascend with right now. Being in normal matches with no friend to help is bleh
<Golakka> Twilight, I could imagine leveting this and firing it with magic or something
<Golakka> http://usarmy.vo.llnwd.net/e2/-images/2008/10/15/23835/army.mil-2008-10-15-073924.jpg
<LadyFluxum> Alchemist: It's a point and click adventure with an IMMENSE lore behind. No, items. Just pure frustrating puzzle solving
<MegaMoonShine> lolwut
<AJIsAwesome> StinkomanFan: Whoops...forgot.:$
<LadyFluxum> And you don't play as a chracter. You play as Yourself
<StinkomanFan> IT's ok man.
<MegaMoonShine> Someone was streaming Riven here once
<LadyFluxum> MegaMoonShine: No way! WHo did?
<Wrek> 05love riven <3
<MegaMoonShine> I think it was wrek
<killerpony7733> MegaMoonShine: shizu
<Jmo> Vivix|Stuff so much stuffff ;~;
<LadyFluxum> Wrek, you cool. You cool
<Wrek> 05and it was shizu
<LadyFluxum> Oh
<MegaMoonShine> Ah yes, I remember
<LadyFluxum> Never cleared that game. Haven't touched it in like 13 years.....
<LadyFluxum> I'm so getting the remake
<Vivix|Stuff> Jmo: I WAS PLAYING SKYRIM <3
<Vivix|Stuff> brfb
<Eddmario> So I finally got a new internet connection set up in my apartment yesterday. Anybody know how long it's gonna be crap?
<Jmo> Vivix|Stuff DAT SKYRIM >:3
<Alchemist> LadyFluxum: Im reading bout Riven on Wiki and it looks good. Do I need to play the previous myst games to enjoy it?
<LadyFluxum> Alchemist: There IS a big ammount of lore but i never played Myst before i played Riven. You get a book at the beginning with everything you need to know
<LadyFluxum> Basically, there is a race of people under the earth writing books that acts as links to other worlds/diemnsions. One of these worlds is Riven that is falling apart due to poor writing of the letters in the book
<Hackalot> I wonder if anyone has Ponified MXC from SpikeTV
<Alchemist> LadyFluxum: I think Ill give it a try. I just dont want to look up lets plays about it on youtube. It would spoil the fun.
<MegaMoonShine> Wait, wrek stopped :S
<LadyFluxum> Alchemist: Just a heads up. It requires alot of your attention and you need to take notice to small details
<Wrek> 05MegaMoonShine: hm?
<Alchemist> LadyFluxum: I will have my pen and paper ready :)
<MegaMoonShine> Just noticed the drawing seems to have stopped
<LadyFluxum> Alchemist: Go with D'ni. Catheryn needs you
<MegaMoonShine> Are you doing something else right now?
<MegaMoonShine> Nevermind
<Jmo> o.o
<Wrek> 05think that mane will work?
<Hackalot> I'm watching MXC while I chat on the Ponychat IRC
<Wrek> 05guise?
<Buytoast> oh shit son
<Buytoast> i haven't seen MXC in years
<Buytoast> looks fine
<MegaMoonShine> Looks good to me
<Alchemist> btw do we have some trilogy planned for tonight? or any movie?
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: Looks fantastic.
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Alchemist> saw that the newsletter is jammed up and I was out of the loop
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: Hey, Serenity!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Halla Serenity
<Dark_Horst> if that thing fires, would the mane be blown outward?
<Dark_Horst> i
<Dark_Horst> i'm wondering becasue, quite frankly, i have absolutely no idea^^
<Wrek> 05if she fires the longsword the mane would be blown back yes
<Wrek> 05but in this shot she is aiming post already firing
<Wrek> 05hence ruffled
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: I think she's just holding it up, and the mane is being blown back by the wind.
<Serenity> Heya everypony. Refreshed the Internet and am typing on a shifty iPod
<MegaMoonShine> Hey Serenity :)
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: if the bullet is big enough and fast enough it could create a vacuum behind it and "suck" the mane front :D
<Cades> have you heard of facade?
<Alchemist> broscience ftw
<Kimori> nope
<Kimori> is it some game?
<AJIsAwesome> *forward*
<Cades> ya
<Serenity> Hey everpony on an iPod atm
<Dark_Horst> is she supposed to hold that thing in telekinesis?
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: Yes.
<Dark_Horst> that might hurt. hope it has some serious recoil dampening
<Cades> i cant really explain it, but basically you go into somebodies house and you talk to them and stuff
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: I always think the horn is more of a medium in which unicorns can concentrate their magical powers onto, so I don't think it'll hurt her.
<Bronysith> i love my civ class in college
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: How is it?
<Bronysith> awesome
<Bronysith> the professor is nice and passionate for her job
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Sweet!

<AJIsAwesome> pony_2404: They haven't said.
<pony_2404> Can I safely assume there will be one though? Or do I have to change my friday night plans?
<AJIsAwesome> pony_2404: You're not a bother. It's okay to ask questions.:)
<killerpony7733> Well rest assured there will be a movie night,
<AJIsAwesome> pony_2404: I'm not sure. You can ask the mods if you want to.
<Jmo> Dat Vivix b finished adventurin'
<pony_2404> Okay. Thank you killerpony7733, that is awesome! And thank you AJIsAwesome for answering me!
<Vivix> Yess, mate
<Vivix> I also, Jmo, read about Wasteland 2 today, so I'm pretty excited
<AJIsAwesome> pony_2404: No problem.
<Jmo> Only just today?
<Jmo> o.o
<Vivix> they got a 2.9 million dollar kickstarter budget, and it's most of the F1 and F2 guys making a sequel to Wasteland-
<Vivix> yeah, I just randomly found it on wikipedia
<Vivix> Pretty--elated, even if it's not Fallout, it looks damn cool
<AJIsAwesome> Brb
<Jmo> Someone is excited
*Vivix grins while shaking
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat metal...Is it norwegian or swedish?
*Vivix weeps
<Emil> YES:
<lowfn|Minecraft> Vivix: I just now found it on Wikipedia aswell.
<Emil> WREK IS DRAWING.

<XylemTube> Welp
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'm listening to master of puppets, I'm going to go back to that.
<Emil> Also, does anyone here have a brony teacher?
<Vivix> lowfn|Minecraft: Like what you see? I''ve never played Wasteland, but- it sounds like a cool game
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Emil: I could only dream.
<spitfirecolt> i am listening to bronyville
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: Is it rare?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Emil: I bet it is. But if I had a brony teacher...ehmagawd.
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: Am I alone with having one then? ;.;
<Jmo> o.o
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Emil: WAIT YOU HAVE ONE?!?
<Dovah> wtf I just hallowed out an entire mountian down to bedrock and still no slime....
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: Yeah.
<Vivix> Back when I was in school we had a teacher who was a big fan of Invader Zim, but thats like..9 years ago

<Vivix> It'was alright, but yeah, he was a nerd and kinda liked--saying weird things, fun teacher
<Dovah> yes yes it did
<Ponies47> Chrysalis: Twilight
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I love invader zim. It's so funny. BTW john de lancie was in it too.
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: I was wearing my Pinkie Pie T-shirt, and she asked why.
<Chrysalis> seems a bit... pink for twilight
<Vivix> Jmo: it's a tiny series, so you could totally do that, some of the episodes are like--7 minutes long
<Chrysalis> or is that just a trick of the light
<Jmo> Eh it's only 3AM, I'm gonna go through it now.
<Vivix> What day is it?
<Golakka> wrek, what the hell are you drawing?
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: She then said she was jealous and had spent the summer watching through all the season after seeing it on the news here in Sweden.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Emil: I bet you guys went into asking each other who is best pony.
*Vivix is too lazy to hover over clock with mouse
<Ponies47> Golakka: Twilight
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: Didn't get to that, we had to go eat lunch.
*Vivix is wearing fisherman clothes, is immune to trout
<Golakka> I got thst Ponies47... but what
<Jmo> Sonova.
<Chrysalis> Vivix weak to rain though
<Vivix> oh yeah...but I'm inside, right?
<Emil> TAKE THAT!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Emil: And ask her if she's ever heard of bronystate.
<Vivix> As long as Jmo don't got a hose, I'm safe
<Jmo> Not if I drag you outside.
<Ponies47> Golakka: I guess her being a sniper agian. He had a sniper rifle on the screen before
<Ponies47> *SHe
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: Might do.
<Ponies47> **No he never mind
<Golakka> god dammit Ponies47, more TF2 shit
<Ponies47> Golakka: Hey I like TF2 D:
<Emil> Twilight is best sniper.
<Emil> Fact.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's weird, I can't watch people play video games.
<Vivix> Twilight is best magician of the living ponies, now that's fact
<Emil> Vivix: Yep.
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: Why not?
<Vivix> I watch people play games more than I play games nowadays- I just like doing other stuff while watching
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Emil: I don't know, it's weird.

<Emil> Don't get your hopes up.
*Dark92Enigma is listening to ''PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN'' remix
<Pinkie_Brony> So, do I need to make an account for this website or did I just have to type in my name like I did and its done?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's sad to think that the outsiders think we're all a bunch of cloppers when we have many talented artist, musicians,etc.
<Emil> Pinkie_Brony: Just type in.
<Dovah> also with the slime thing. can they spawn on peaceful cuz all my weapons are broke now...
<Pinkie_Brony> Emil: Sweet
<Emil> Kawaii_icybeauti: Tough love, sugarcube.
<Emil> Pinkie_Brony: It's really simple.
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/g5B7SN.png
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Emil: I guess so
<StinkomanFan> TWILIGHT SNIPER
<Pinkie_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti: Ikr, what is normal anyways, by whos definition?
<Pinkie_Brony> *Whose
<Emil> Chrysalis: Oh, Tekkit?
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: that's insane! :O
<Emil> Chrysalis: Then you will NEVER have enough stuff.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Pinkie_Brony: If beung normal means being guido and saying "swag" and "yolo" being normal aucks
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Looks very high def
<Chrysalis> oh god not
<Chrysalis> tekkit is terrible
<Chrysalis> custom mod set
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: It's because they're being judgemental and closeminded.
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/g5B7SN.png
<Emil> Chrysalis: I see.
<Chrysalis> oops relink
<AJIsAwesome> I REALLY hate YOLO.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: Yeah. Nut this fanbase kicks ass, and I wish people saw that.
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/ny9ZAD.png
<Vivix> Technic was great, I play 6.0.7, but the newest update is terrible. Never really played tekkit
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: Same here.
<Pinkie_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti: Normal is just a way of saying that you're boring and not awesome
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: I think of it as "You obviously love octavia"
<Chrysalis> just to show much much i mines out
<Jmo> Dat Vivix
<Emil> AJIsAwesome: You Obviously Love Octavia.
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Why does it look like it's in HD
<Chrysalis> mined*
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: we're all a little insane :D
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: Emil :D Nice!
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 16x faithful texture pack
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: It's like all the misfits teamed up. I love that.
<Emil> And the thing about life is that we're just one in 7 billion.
<Emil> We're not important.
<Pinkie_Brony> I can't do computer art like this but I can draw awesomelyness
<Chrysalis> i have the draw distance on so low or the server lags HORRIBLY cause of how much i have running
<Emil> We have 2 goals in life.
<Emil> Survival and reproduction.
<Emil> That's it.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Drawing isn't my cutie mark. My friend is an awesome artist though.
<Jmo> LOL
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: but we're almost all good misfits :3
<Thunder-Crescent> is there an equestria minecraft multiplayer surver
<AJIsAwesome> Emil: But we're growing every day, so that's a plus.
<Emil> Thunder-Crescent: think so.
<Chrysalis> emil there is a 3rd,
<Chrysalis> Ponies
<Emil> AJIsAwesome: Still, we're not important.
<Pinkie_Brony> I can draw an awesome Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash :D
<AJIsAwesome> Emil: Who says?
<Emil> Chrysalis: True true.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: Yeah, like my mom said when she brought me to broyncon, there will always be the creeps, but they're everywhere. She said that most of the peopel she saw looked nice and shy.
<Vivix> We're too many to all be important
<Vivix> but that makes life worth living
<Vivix> We're important to eachother
<Kawaii_icybeauti> You know, you have more chances to get autism than to get famous.
<Pinkie_Brony> Vivix: True words
<Emil> Vivix: Excactly. Only way to be important is to be colsely related to someone.
<Chrysalis> screw quarrys, THIS is a resource collector http://theadmin.co.uk/ScrSnp/0vo9GZ.png
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: So true.
<Emil> *closely
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: all fandoms have creeps and jerks, that can't be helped. We have little of those luckily :$
<Emil> MadSurge: I am tired of that excuse.
<Vivix> We do have the fastest growing porn archive at r34 though
<Emil> MadSurge: But it's ture.
<Emil> *true
<Pinkie_Brony> You know, I don't care if other people don't like the show, just don't criticize me for liking it
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkie_Brony: Same here.
<Emil> Pinkie_Brony: That ain't gonna work.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MadSurge: Yeah. I did mention to my mom there are creeps in the catholic church (My family is catholic) so she kind of just went with it.
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> ;__;
<Chrysalis> that poor trout
<Emil> lol
<Pinkie_Brony> Emil: You're right, it won't, but I wish it would
*Vivix hugs Jmo like an abused wife
*Chrysalis sends the trout for councelling
<Jmo> D'awwwwww
<CrazyHippie1234> Hi everypony
<Emil> Pinkie_Brony: Self pity doesn't help. And prayer neither.
*Jmo glomps Vivix

<Pinkie_Brony> CrazyHippie1234: Hi :)
<Emil> Pinkie_Brony: Violent ones are the most easy ones.
<Chrysalis> oh wow
<Emil> MadSurge: Yeah.
<CrazyHippie1234> Well hi Pinkie_Brony

<CrazyHippie1234> Pinkie_Brony: (\
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's funny how fussing on such a small detail like white in a eye and added color can bring it to life.
<MLP_Brovakiin> CrazyHippie1234: Goodbye
<killerpony7733> Gotta love rammstein except this is one of their songs done by someone else
<Pinkie_Brony> CrazyHippie1234: /)(\

<CrazyHippie1234> :O
<Vivix> lowfn|Minecraft: Ooh, I like her voice. Didn't really sound like pinkie, but amazing singing voice
<Pinkie_Brony> So when you go to theaters, what are the different names supposed to represent?
<Vivix> In fact- I don't know if she's supposed to sound like Pinkie-
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Jenny does have a good singing voive.
<Chrysalis> Pinkie_Brony for the larger streams they represent subrooms
<Vivix> I also like lyrics-
<Chrysalis> they are closed for unnoficial streams
<Chrysalis> but for events such as new eps
<Chrysalis> theyre used for crowd control
<lowfn|Minecraft> Vivix: When your loved ones have been mangled!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Pinkie_Brony: When they strat streaming the new episodes, the rooms will come out liek that.
<Vivix> Aah Yeaah
<Vivix> In fact, I'll go listen to it now

<Kawaii_icybeauti> survivor: Haha it's not technically videos /)
<survivor> yay!
<Pinkie_Brony> When are the new episodes airing for MLP, does anyone know?
<Vivix> We aren't allowed to link profiles either, during stream
<Vivix> this fall
<Pinkie_Brony> *anypony
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Pinkie_Brony: There still isn't a release date.
<Vivix> anyone and anypony are interchangable, for ponies anybody and anypony are different
<Pinkie_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti: But they're making them?
<Dark92Enigma> Oh yeah, here comes the mane....
<Dark92Enigma> BTW, no plans for Movie Night?
<Vivix> Pinkie_Brony: Oh yeah, they're more or less done. Rumour is September, but it could be Sep-Dec
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Pinkie_Brony: Of course! But this season only has 13 episodes due to some legal stuff the company had. It's no biggie though.
<Vivix> Ooh, that was the reason? Wil just said "certain" or something- many thought it was hint at movie
<Magical_Pablez94> Kawaii_icybeauti really?
<Pinkie_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti: Sounds good to me (:
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kawaii_icybeauti: They will be 30mins long instead of 22 though
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Just so long as it starts ebfore competition season.
<Pinkie_Brony> Vivix: Yes!
<Vivix> 22:44 is animation standard, with ads thats 30 minutes
<Pinkie_Brony> I'm on my third runthrough for season 1 and 2
<Vivix> so I think they'll still be 22:44
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: Wait, adding comercials or not?
<RaveBrony> Of COURSE! I leave to help my father with something and miss the EYE!!! :'(
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kawaii_icybeauti: No adds I think
*RaveBrony flips his desk
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: Oh cool
<Vivix> but that would be breaking all standards of modern TV
<Vivix> I don't think it's 30 minutes minus ads-
<Kawaii_icybeauti> If onyl no commercials lol
<Ponies47> RaveBrony: O.O
<MLP_Brovakiin> Vivix: They would be 45 mins with ads probably
<Vivix> but that's drama slot-
<RaveBrony> I always miss the drawing of the eye :'(

<Panda> back guys :d
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: You where a tad bit hyperactive earlier :D
<Vivix> EQD is good for news, but that's all it is, really. It's not a hangout spot
<Panda> oops
<CCCP> I like EQD over most brony related sites
<CrazyHippie1234> HI Panda
<Dovah> you know what? screw slime I'll just say my house is done and when i find slime Ill add to it....

<Wrek> 05i think i finally figured out a way to make twi's straight cut mane look good
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wrek: looking good, and the rammsteint adds nicely.
<Vivix> I think for me it's EQD, FIM/Ponyfic Archive and This in a bundle
<Vivix> though FIM can get on my nerves-
<MadSurge> Wrek: SUCCESS!!! /)
<Pinkie_Brony> Wrek: Are you doing this live or is it recorded? jw
<Dovah> So with that being said: yay I finally finished my first ligit house on minecraft :)
<Wrek> 05always live
<Kawaii_icybeauti> oh thats what I'll listen to next.
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: Amazing!
<killerpony7733> Pinkie_Brony: 99% of everything streamed is live,
<Vivix> wait, movies and shows, and youtube
<MadSurge> Nice Dovah!
<Pinkie_Brony> killerpony7733: awesome ha
<XylemTube> I'd like to see a color swap and a hidden wizzard hat at the last second to make trixie. Just to see everybody's reaction.
<Vivix> episodes and games, and this, is probably onlie 'live'
<killerpony7733> Vivix: So in short, 99% of not 100% is live
<Vivix> More lke 40% is live, rest is stream
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: :D
<killerpony7733> Vivix: I was talking as far as, When a mod streams it's live. But yes they do live stream things that are recorded in a sense
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek gonna take a guess and say, her mane flowing like its in the wind?
<Vivix> Ah yes, I was refering to how- only the games and art are are live, and I don't know how often they're shown by the mods- wrek and phase4 does the most of live I think-
<MadSurge> YESH!
<Pinkie_Brony> brb everypony, got some homework I have to attend to :/
<MadSurge> FEUER FREI!
<XylemTube> BANG BANG
<CrazyHippie1234> DOUBLE KILL

<Dovah> its still a stream
<Golakka> This looks like twilight lying on a duvet right now....
<Metronome> Ok:S
<MadSurge> lowfn|Minecraft: it's a theater concept, we're supposed to pretend that the actors are closed into a room with four walls and the 4th is the one facing the audience.
<Golakka> Wrek... Is there something you are not telling us
<lowfn|Minecraft> MadSurge: I see.
<lowfn|Minecraft> We must break the roof
<Wrek> 05Golakka: hm?

<MadSurge> As you can see Wrek is making another masterpiece
<Eli> good evening :) thx AJIsAwesome
<Eli> and yeah MadSurge i see ;)
<Eli> though she doesn't seem quite happy, that Twily :(
<Bunny-Striker> Fucking hell, I put salt in my coffee, make one later
<AJIsAwesome> Her horn reminds me of the drills from Gurren Lagann...
<XylemTube> Given how tall she in in this pic. I would call her Princess Twilight
<Eli> Bunny-Striker: why would you put salt in your coffe?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I hate plastic bezels for laptops. <<
<Bunny-Striker> Eli: Salt and sugar look the same
<MadSurge> Eli: she's having a badass moment though
<Major> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m97tufBNDr1res3imo1_1280.gif
<Bunny-Striker> lol
<Eli> MadSurge: lol, from just sehing her head, i thought she would be lying in bed, sulking or something. i didn't see the pose at first :) badass
<Barbetos|AtWork> Major pretty sure that is waht FIM would of looked like if it weren't for Fuast.
<survivor> http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSHHAS/videos
<Major> Barbetos|AtWork: hell TF2 + Ponies - Fuast = Me Approve :D

<Major> MadSurge: nope, but Im sure I dont want to :D
<Quick_Thinker> that art is much MUCH MUCH better then i can do :l
<MadSurge> Major: It's hilarious, youtube "fire fire fire" :D
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: The Great Cartoon Character Secret Santa / Won't Sompony Think of the Trees / You Haven't Aged A Day
<Major> MadSurge: by that title I already regret hearing about it XD
<Quick_Thinker> also newsflash on my dilema with my parents about the hoodie they are probely going to allow to keep it ,BUT now another dilema has popped up
<MadSurge> Major: it's so happy :D and that's how I play pyro :D
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: What is it?
<Bunny-Striker> moo
<Quick_Thinker> well my lifelonf best friend saw the READ A BOOK bag and immeaditly declared me gay, I know what most what say then he's not a very good friend then you should leave ,but the thing is he was my friend from my childhood and we have been friends for a long time i don't know what to do or tell him
<Vivix> let him walk it off
<Vivix> People say stupid things- and he'll probably pull himself together
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: Try explaining to him. Did he listen to reason?
<Bunny-Striker> Quick_Thinker: Show him Cupcakes
<Vivix> Ha'
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey y'all! How is everypony doing? :)
<Quick_Thinker> well he thinks that ponys are gay and i have not been able to get him to watch the show or give it an honest fair shot
<Vivix> No, but honestly. People say rash things when annoyed or confronted, he'll probably ignore it if you just- let him
<Dovah> Quick_Thinker: if he cant exept it then he isnt your friend.
<AJIsAwesome> Fisheh_Fish: Hello!
<Vivix> Do not try to make him watch teh show
<Vivix> he'll just get more annoyed with it
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Fisheh_Fish :)
<Dovah> accept
<MadSurge> Ohai Fisheh_Fish! Doing good!
<Dovah> *
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: Just give him time. Don't try to force him to like something he doesn't.
<Vivix> ^
<MadSurge> ^^
<Quick_Thinker> Dovah i know that but i have been his friend for my entire life im just trying to make him stop being an ass
<SirGanjalf> ^^^
<Vivix> People come around, even if you do something they don't like that you're doing, they usually come around
<Quick_Thinker> but hes been hanging around the wrong crowd in high school and i fear i may have lost him
<Buytoast> wait, what's all this about books?
<Dovah> Quick_Thinker: Bullet can be pretty persuasive..
<Buytoast> did someone wear a pony shirt or something?
<Dovah> just ask heavey
<Vivix> Read a book bag
<Dovah> heavy*
<Barbetos|AtWork> Take the guy I work with for example. I got him to like apple bloom a few months back. This morning he told me how he started reading wikis on MLP: FiM, and at lunch he watched the first episode today XD
<Vivix> Nice!
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: Then try to bring him out of that group. Have a personal conversation with him and tell him that you don't like how he's become.
<Buytoast> if it's anything pony related you had it coming
<Vivix> None of my friends watch the show, but none of htem care that I do
<Buytoast> if not then i dunno
<Thunder-Crescent> im going to hit the hay ill be on TF2 tomorrow so ill see you whe i see you bye bronies *brohoofs to everypony ?)
<Barbetos|AtWork> So the trick is get them to like a single pony, and then it just snowballs after that.
<AJIsAwesome> Thunder-Crescent: Night!
<Vivix> I'm not in touch with any of my childhood friends-
<Dovah> wtf happend to teh musics!
<Vivix> all moved away and stuff changes
<Quick_Thinker> well my other best friend couldn't stand the show but soon he found he liked RD and next thing i know yesterday he sent pony swag pics from hot topic
<otakon> I think Wrek went offline
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey guys.... if bronyfunds working?
<otakon> yeah he's not even in chat atm
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Thunder-Crescent
<Bunny-Striker> I`m not going to be here tonight, got go to sleep at 8:30 for football tryouts
<Vivix> Quick_Thinker: Aww, that's nice.
<Bunny-Striker> need to wake up early
<Buytoast> shameful
<Buytoast> even more disgraceful he likes rainbow bitch
<Dovah> bleh time for my own tunes then -_-
<Vivix> But yeah, I'm no good with heart to heart, but that might be the best way if he's falling into the wrong crowd. More so than he not liking that you enjoy the show
<Quick_Thinker> Buytoast please stop
<Dark_Horst> no more stream or is that just me?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> i'm trying to get commissions to help pay $200 rent... extra goes to $1000 eye surgery. reached so far $30
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Don't be a dick, dude.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> i really need help
<BlizzardBlack1>

<Wrek> yeh*
<Wrek> atleast
<Wrek> rammstein
<CountDoofus> Can't go wrong with Rammstein.
<Bronysith> the primary reason some people want to learn german is to understand rammstein
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehh he can't do anything with it anyway no credit card info
<Eli> their lyrics are surprisingly inteligent most of the time
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also it seems that my name is lee tom and i live in begin
<otakon> and back
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the account is limited until y add credit info and other stuff wich i'm not going to do
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wrek: Not more metal, you have already got me hooked on RAUBTIER 6_9
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the bad part is that i can't close it until i add that stuff
<kirzstryfe> >.<
<Bronysith> so slow
<Bronysith> chat is so slow today
<Bronysith> <.<
<Bronysith> >.>
<Bronysith> NEKKID TIME
*Bronysith dances about
<Eli> one question: is Ramstein that famous because the music is good, or because you all think german is funny?
*MLP_Brovakiin joins Bronysith and dances
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i blame paypal for not asking email confirmation when singing to their service
*MLP_Brovakiin collapses from lack of oxygen
<Vivix> When we heard rammstein as kids, we were like "German is cool, man"
<Vivix> but- I never listened to rammstein fater that
<Vivix> after*
<Sumica> 00,10good song
<Buytoast> ooo, du hast

<Shizuka> 13clearly you have never heard blumchen
<otakon> Blumchen?
<Eli> Vivix: true. as a kid i thought french is cool :P silly me
<RaveBrony> O_o?
<Vivix> Hehe
<otakon> the hell is taht Shizuka?
<Vivix> I don't really like any metal anymore
<Vivix> when I was 12 I really liked black metal
<Eli> Blümchen? what's that Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13i will have to queue some up next time i stream
<CountDoofus> A Belgian stand-up comedian claims everything sounds aggresive in German.

<Eli> yeah, german is funny like that. that gives me an idea: if anyone wants a fanfic translated to german, ping me. would be fun. we could post it here later
<CountDoofus> About a 1000 time better than I could make 'em, that's for sure.
<TheMaster> I was confused because I hadn't even been talking

<Sumica> 00,10hey I just noticed, I now have a scroll bar on my games list on steam.
<Dovah> dayum now that I started paying attention to all the new bronies here... i think we may make the 300 mark
<TheMaster> because season 3 is (hopefully) starting soon. some of us have been here fromt he beginning
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, really?
<SnowyFluttershy> I've already watched the first two series twice each.
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: enjoy our mod Wrek's art and chat with us about what you like! :)
<Fisheh_Fish> Nice dude
<AJIsAwesome> SnowyFluttershy: There's a season 3 coming soon.:)
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, I liek ponies

<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: Like? I don't like them, I LOVE them!
<Sumica> 00,1049 and yes Shizuka
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, I like chocolate milk
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #63
<AJIsAwesome> Golakka: Be careful what you post, dude.:S
<Eli> really Golakka?
<Golakka> Thats absentia :D
<TheMaster> every time I see the eqd update I hope for a moment its going to be something like "SEASON 3 BEGINS X DATE"
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: shush, you're lactose intolerant! :D
<Dj_Cyber-4G> what did he say?
<TheMaster> and then have my hopes dashed.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> BTW Ello Everypony!
<MadSurge> Shizuka: the Pyro's version of Smile Smile Smile is hilarious! :D
<CountDoofus> Haio Dj_Cyber-4G
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey Dj_Cyber-4G
<Sumica> 00,10my guss is 2weeks 2 days.
<Michael> ohai Dj_Cyber-4G
<AJIsAwesome> Dj_Cyber-4G: Hello!
<TheMaster> 2 weeks until announced start?
<TheMaster> when was season 2 announced?
<otakon> dammit stream died
<CountDoofus> otakon: It did naaaaht.
<Sumica> 00,10mind you I am just going by hub having showen all of s1 and 2 on the weekends
<killerpony7733> TheMaster: Oh it's funny EQD were that stupid to believe a rumor, And then said sorry for saying it was highly likely
<Shizuka> 13no comments on bread .-.
<Sumica> 00,10they have showen all the eps in order
<Shizuka> 13just one fav..
<Dovah> Sumica: really? i havnt noticed that...
<TheMaster> so...in 2 weeks you think season 3 will become real?
<RaveBrony> What bread? :o
<SnowyFluttershy> So what's this ''Friday movie night''?
<TheMaster> without even a announcment to get hyped?
<Sumica> 00,10not counting this weekend due to event they last 2 eps will be next weekend
<Fisheh_Fish> SnowyFluttershy: We watch movies :D
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: Well, everyone makes mistakes. It's a fact of life.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> Ello again sumica i was in the mass effect stream you did a while ago
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> This -> makes more sense than it should http://derpy.me/3qWSL
<Michael> SnowyFluttershy: watch movies and 2 MLP ep
<TheMaster> I guess it makes sense that the target audience isn't internet savvy to -get- hyped.
<Dovah> I must verify what Sumica says
<SnowyFluttershy> I mean what sort of movie's?
<Sumica> 00,10hello Dj_Cyber-4G
<SnowyFluttershy> Just random or what?
<Fisheh_Fish> Random
<TheMaster> but by now you think they'd give a tweet or something.
<RaveBrony> Lolwut
<Michael> SnowyFluttershy: random
<Vivix> They will give sound when they can
<Vivix> Business is business
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome: Eeeeh, As a brony news site. You need to have evidence backing the news if it's very important. But in that case it was purely stupid of them
<Vivix> S1 of simpsons was delayed 3 months 3 weeks or so before premiere?
<AJIsAwesome> SnowyFluttershy: There is a lottery they announce when they pool all of our suggested movies/episodes and choose a select few.
<Sumica> 00,10then again I still belive we will have another 13 eps anounced by november so take what I say worth a grain of salt
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Eli> killerpony7733: it's not like they're gettin payd...
<Vivix> Hehe
<SnowyFluttershy> Ah ok
<TheMaster> I want to believe Sumica
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: unfortunately they had problems with it lately
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: It's still a mistake, though. Nothing to get hung up about.
<TheMaster> my heart won't be able to take breaks for too long though.
<Vivix> I didn't even see said mistake
<TheMaster> like that 2 week wait inbetween eps 2 and 3 for season 3
<TheMaster> or was it a whole month
<SnowyFluttershy> To be honest, i'm still quite new to this whole thing, although I want to get more involved, so anyting you could share with me about MLP would be appreciated ^^
<TheMaster> season 2*
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome: Eh i just think it was silly of them. Cause many people were getting so hyped and some are still fooled by the rumor due to it
<Golakka> Ill speak to you lot tomorrow!
<CountDoofus> Seeya Golakka
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: Remeber one of the PR's for Care Bears sent that strange email talking about the show?
<Sumica> 00,10funfact eqd dose make money
<DoctoDoctorWho> I just found the ginyu force full theme song, my life is complete
<Vivix> killerpony7733: it was silly of them, but- they were probably so hyped they wanted to believe it? Either way
<TheMaster> Seth must be pretty happy then.
<TheMaster> what is eqd making money on?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Golakka
<AJIsAwesome> Golakka: Bye!
<Vivix> Ads
<Michael> bye Golakka
<Fisheh_Fish> Bye Golakka
<SnowyFluttershy> Cya
<Dovah> love this song
<Dj_Cyber-4G> their are 2 things i like but shouldn't pokemon [GAMES NOT ANIME] and a bit of star wars [the OLDER star wars games ]
<Sumica> 00,10on things they dont even own TheMaster
<Fisheh_Fish> SnowyFluttershy: Do you know the basic IRC commands?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye SnowyFluttershy
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Still they ARE a news site for anything MLP FIM related and something as big as when the season starts has to be fact
<CountDoofus> Gah... I see wrek doing it, but can't determine what tools he's using -.-
<SnowyFluttershy> IRC Commands?
<Vivix> killerpony7733: totally agree with you, they probably totally lapsed on it and made a bad decision. Not really--any doubt that they shouldn't have though
<TheMaster> what i'm seeing thats interesting is that at this rate of creativity the fandom may just start producing its own animated, and voice acted episodes on its own.
<SnowyFluttershy> [In other words, no]
<kirzstryfe> EqD has posted false rumors and outright incorrect reports in the past, multiple times
<Vivix> I don't watch much fanmade content, so fanmade sodes--I probably would not watch
<Vivix> also true
<Fisheh_Fish> SnowyFluttershy: There's an action command that you can do by typing "/me" infront of what you want to type
<CountDoofus> Not even the Picture Perfect music video?
<Michael> TheMaster: since the "movie" of photo finish song, i believe it
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: if you want to change nick without exiting the chat or use a third person for yourself :D
<CountDoofus> Picture Perfect Pony*
<Vivix> CountDoofus: I don't know that one, is that the luna one?
*SnowyFluttershy Test
<Vivix> No, it's finished?
<Bigjack> hi all
<Fisheh_Fish> And to quickly say someone's name, partially type out their name, and hit "Tab"
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Bigjack
<Fisheh_Fish> There ya go SnowyFluttershy :)
<SnowyFluttershy> Fisheh_Fish: Test
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: perfect!
<Michael> hai Bigjack
<CountDoofus> Nah, it's a song with Photo Finish. If you didn't know it was fanmade, you'd SWEAR it's a season 3 leak.
<AJIsAwesome> Bigjack: Hello!
<Fisheh_Fish> Heya Bigjack
<Dovah> horry shit what sumica saz is true!
<SnowyFluttershy> Hey
<Bigjack> nice picture ^^
<CountDoofus> Haio Bigjack
<kirzstryfe> so does anyone else remember a year or so ago when the drawfriends started, and they said that they'd only post canon ponies and nothing sexual?
<Fisheh_Fish> SnowyFluttershy: When you partially type out the name, and hit "Tab", it makes a Ping noise
<AJIsAwesome> CountDoofus: TBH, I could already tell it was a fanmade music video by the beginning.
<Vivix> CountDoofus: ah nice, but yeah- I tend to stay away from fananimation- I get a bit starstruck and jealous, ha. But, fanmade episodes would make me cringe with eh fanon vs canon issues-- but..you never know
<Sumica> 00,10well the observation is trew Dovah
<AJIsAwesome> kirzstryfe: What's wrong?
<SnowyFluttershy> Ah ok
<Sumica> 00,10what it meens is subject to interprtation
<Vivix> Oh yeah, No OC's and child friendly
<SnowyFluttershy> So it sort of let's them know your asking them a qustion
<Dovah> Sumica: I didnt belive u so I had to check....
<Bigjack> what a program do you use?
<Vivix> it has skidded out of that, but all their vaginas have been accidental
<Fisheh_Fish> Yeah, pretty much
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: another thing is that links are allowed, but video links are forbidden during streams and all links are forbidden during movie night
<Bronysith> otakon: so pyromancer is a good starter class in dark souls?
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: What?:S
<otakon> YES
<SnowyFluttershy> Got it
<CountDoofus> My latest comic had like 13 OCs, and EqD accepted that in a comic post.
<otakon> I've told you before YES
<otakon> also, i'm out for now
<otakon> gotta mow the grass
*SnowyFluttershy will be right back.
<otakon> bbl guys!
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: Whenver EqD has accidentally posted something mature
<CountDoofus> Seeya, otakon
<Bronysith> otakon: gnight otakon
<otakon> not sleeping
<Fisheh_Fish> See ya later otakon
<kirzstryfe> "accidentally" my ass :P
<Michael> bye otakon
<Bronysith> o ahh he gone
<CountDoofus> Ich will!
<CountDoofus> <3
<Vivix> I don't think they look at most of the images
<Vivix> or music
<Vivix> only fanfiction
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye otakon
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: also, request ponies to mods at your own risk :D you may not get Friendship is Magic!
<AJIsAwesome> Can everyone calm down about EQ Daily? It was a mistake, and it's in the past.
<TheMaster> which is interesting. since most of the fanfiction is pretty bad anyway
<Sumica> 00,10It's ok Dovah, I would not belive me either
<Dovah> lol
<Vivix> Hehhe
<Bigjack> the game dark souls its on pc too?
<TheMaster> it will be soon
<TheMaster> or it is
<Vivix> An AJIsAwesome I'm not mad at EQD or anything, I like them, just making smalltalk
<MadSurge> Bigjack: it's coming out in a few days
<TheMaster> i know its already out on pirate bay and what not
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Okay, just didn't want things to escalate.
<TheMaster> someone leaked it
<SnowyFluttershy> MadSurge: What do you mean?
<TheMaster> and they're apparently cracking it in various ways
<Bigjack> cool
<Bigjack> MadSurge: cool ;D
<Wrek> im not suprised darksouls is alreayud out on TPB
<TheMaster> I wonder how many more viewers we'll have at season 3 start compared to season 2 start
<Wrek> the fiels are available from steam
<Sumica> 00,10dat machinima
<Wrek> all you gotta do is to crack the laucnehr and voila
<TheMaster> you'd think anyone on the internet would have already heard about my little pony by now
<AJIsAwesome> TheMaster: Everyone has their own opinion. Some people may like it, some people won't. It's a fact of life.
<CountDoofus> Guild Wars 2 soon! Who's playing?
<Bronysith> Wrek: wait what? it wont unlock for another 10 hours...
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: I mean that the mods will stream whatever they like, and if you request ponies to be streamed you might get the older series instead :D
<Dovah> damn i can only see as far as when the last round up is on btw Sumica it appears that lunar eclipse wont be on unless i missed it somehow.
<Bigjack> what do you think about darksider 2?
<Vivix> What wa the viewcount on S2 premier? I remember at end of season it was around.. 3000? wow my memory is crap
<kirzstryfe> less than a week CountDoofus :)
<SnowyFluttershy> Haha ok ^^
<TheMaster> it was crazy high
<Bigjack> i would play guild wars 2 but its not free to play ;_;
<Sumica> 00,10that was some time ago. Dovah
<TheMaster> chat is pretty much unreadable even in the individual groups
<kirzstryfe> it is free to play, you just have to buy the game
<TheMaster> ie. the last round up start
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: so where are you from? :)
<Vivix> Yeah, I never chat during saturday ponies, soo much chat
<Michael> Bigjack: i played it and its awesome
*Nittany_Discord wishes S3 would be announced already

*Bronysith glomps Nittany_Discord and puts him in a maid corset

<Vivix> SnowyFluttershy: only if the stream is off
<CountDoofus> SnowyFluttershy: Not during a stream, no.
<TheMaster> oh okay. makes sense
<Bigjack> duuno i just read it about guild wars 2 and they wroten ot free to play but if oyu said its free then k ;D

<DoctoDoctorWho> Nittany_Discord: are you insinuating that your behavior mimics that of the female gender currently employed in the cleaning service?
<Sumica> 00,10sounded liek the title of a bond movie
<Bigjack> what do you think about DARKSIDER 2?
<Nittany_Discord> DoctoDoctorWho: Yes.
<CountDoofus> Nittany_Discord: Well, it HAS clop scenes, but the author marks them as such and provides a non-clop version of those chapters.
*Dovah facehoofs at DoctoDoctorWho's qustion
<Nittany_Discord> Pass
<MadSurge> Bigjack: I'm curious if they'll ever do a game with Pestilence or Famine :D
<Bigjack> x.x
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Good man :D
<Vivix> That fanfic was okay- but I got kindof bored of it-
<Wrek> better than expected
<Vivix> Trixie wasn't mean enough
<Michael> brb
<Nittany_Discord> I'm curious. Why is she a maid?
<Bigjack> well i play now Divinity 2 as Warrior xd
<SnowyFluttershy> MadSurge: The second is about Death, but the third game is actually going to be multiplayer with all 4 available
<Vivix> Nittany_Discord: Twilight thinks it will help her release her good side
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: you dont want any suggestive pics? okay then
<Nittany_Discord> Not really Bronysith.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: mmmk
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: aha, a game nerd! Welcome aboard :$
<CountDoofus> Vivix: "Of Maids and Mistresses", right?
<SnowyFluttershy> Yay <3
<Vivix> Yeah, that's the one CountDoofus
<Dovah> wish me luck I'm going to try to get my xlive working..
<Michael> back
<Vivix> It's good, but I felt it was a bit- average in quality at times
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: I assume you like 'Shy the most, yes?
<Vivix> It didn't get me, really, as a shipfic
<Bigjack> ok i go now bye all bro hoofs all (\^^/)
<SnowyFluttershy> Yup yup
<Nittany_Discord> Later Bigjack
<MadSurge> Bye Bigjack!
<Eli> Night all
<Wrek> or what do you say sumica?
<Michael> bye Bigjack (\
<AJIsAwesome> Bigjack: Bye! /)
<Wrek> twilights and the lognsword sniper works well together :3
<SnowyFluttershy> Cya Bigjack
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Bigjack
<Bronysith> Shizuka: that bread looks delicious
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I prefer that over the bazzar bargen that she always seems to be using in the videos
<CountDoofus> Nittany_Discord: in that fic, Twilight realizes Trixie is surpressing bad foalhood memories by forcing herself into the role of a showmare. In an attempt to break her out of it, she forces Trixie into another role; that of a maid. Only, it only makes things worse... And Twilight doesn't realize is, until it's almost too late.
<CountDoofus> (sorry for wall o' text)
<CountDoofus> it*
<Vivix> Oh, I was only half way through it, didn't know she got worse-
<Michael> CountDoofus: u made the fanfic?
<CountDoofus> ... Woops.
<Vivix> No problem ^^
<CountDoofus> Nah, sadly. Wish I had that much talent :)
<Dovah> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck damn that Gigabit and his supposed fucking up my xlive!
<Vivix> Maybe I'll pick it up again, reading Twilight Effect atm
<Wrek> oh well
<Wrek> gona finish my stream
<CountDoofus> It was written by the same author who wrote "Cheerilee's Garden", though. I LOVED that fic.
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: :S
<Michael> thx Wrek for the stream
<Nittany_Discord> And let me guess, there's Twixie clop in it?
<Vivix> CountDoofus: Reaaally? I never read that, but he sounded like a great guy
<SnowyFluttershy> How do I know who the mod's are?
<AJIsAwesome> SnowyFluttershy: They have the @ symbol.
<CountDoofus> Nittany_Discord: Oh yeah. Applejack and Rainbow get a slice too.
<Dovah> the @ by their names
<Vivix> but I didn't like of maids very much, I thought was a bit eh..hard to feel
<Buytoast> wasn't cheerilees garden that fic with all the child murder and shit?
<SnowyFluttershy> Ah ok
<Wrek> and that we use colors
<Sumica> 00,10the ones with @ or % infrom of there name
<Wrek> mine isnt working today s'all
<Vivix> Buytoast: yeah, he wrote it to creep himself out
<Nittany_Discord> Buytoast: Yep.
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: also only they can use colored text
<RaveBrony> You all scare me away from fics i swear :D
<CountDoofus> Not only that, the guy's Belgian. Like me. We're all a little messed up in the head :D
<Nittany_Discord> Child torture and murder.
<Vivix> Fics are great, I don't read gore
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should change the subject............:S
<Vivix> but*
<DoctoDoctorWho> Is it on the same f***ed up level as cupcakes and related?
<RaveBrony> ah, who am i kidding, i dont have time for reading!! Haha :D
<Nittany_Discord> Not something you want to read unless you don't mind something grimdark like that.
<AJIsAwesome> Who likes pie?
<Vivix> I've read 8.5 million words at the moment-
<Michael> i liek pie
<SnowyFluttershy> CUPCAKES
<Nittany_Discord> And then there's a sequel, but the Mane 6 die in it.
<RaveBrony> Ill read a paragraph and forget about whatever im reading :D
<Dovah> new idea instead of blaming gigabit form my broken xlive i balme DoctoDoctorWho!
<Vivix> I never read it, but I read his comments as to why he wrote it- sounded sane enough
<CountDoofus> A fic I could recommend is "My Roommate is a Vampire". No gore, no clop.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: no, let's keep talking about shitty grimdark fanfics :D
<RaveBrony> I just dont see how people can do it! x_x
<MadSurge> :O
<Michael> i see star trek?
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: apple pie is the best
<CountDoofus> E-mail!
<MadSurge> Star Trek tiem!
<Vivix> CountDoofus: I was thinking abou reading that, but I'm wary of commedy- and Vinly
<SnowyFluttershy> How do I make Ponie emoticons?
<Dark_Horst> Michael: you do? i see wrek drawing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Grimdark in this channel is a dangerous subject.

<SnowyFluttershy> And yet she's so kind, all she REALLY wanted was to befriend some people.
<DoctoDoctorWho> looks like we're in for a big ol' storm of shi-I mean chaos, :3
<SnowyFluttershy> Uhh... ponies.
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: my favs are 'Shy and Pinkie :D
<Vivix> Rarity, Shy and pinkie here
<Wrek> people said that enterprises intro was a modo kilelr for the quick intro
<Wrek> if thats true
<Wrek> then DS9's msut be a snorefest
<AJIsAwesome> SnowyFluttershy: Mine's obvious.:D
<Wrek> mood killer*
<Michael> i wub all the ponies
<Vivix> Enterprise was jarring because it was suddenly dur all over the place
<MadSurge> Wrek: I like this intro
<Vivix> Major*
<CountDoofus> I got a few more fics I'd recommend, but... You know... option to go beyond PG-13 is there, so I'll keep quiet.
<Vivix> but I liked the Enterprise intro nontheless
<Deadlypon3> ...DIng
<SnowyFluttershy> Gotta be Shy, Angle and Derpy forme.
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: Are you going to change your text color?
<Vivix> CountDoofus: How is My roomate is a vampire, though? I've got tons to read now, but- I was curious about that one
<Wrek> not untill i get back on mIRC
<Wrek> and stop pinging me
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry.:$
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: who doesn't love Derpy? :P
<Dovah> k kerW no more ping
<Vivix> If you got W 7 you can mute the window with webclient
<SnowyFluttershy> Haha.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im getting pings but I see nothing? what is this witchcraft?
<Vivix> Streamer is using webclient, pingnoises galore
<SnowyFluttershy> I love how they put angle there to compliment Fshy's bad side.
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: you can here wreks pings
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: that's Wre k's pings
<Dovah> so dont ping him
<DoctoDoctorWho> oh, k
<MadSurge> exactly
<Bronysith> so Q is in TNG and DS9?
<Deadlypon3> "Silver and- Oh wait..."
<Michael> what's that?
<Wrek> wasnt he in voyager too?
<Nittany_Discord> And in Voyager.
<Wrek> atleast one?
<Wrek> yeh
<Nittany_Discord> He was in a couple at least.
<Bronysith> i still need to watch more TNG
<Bronysith> just cant be bothered ATM
<Nittany_Discord> 12345
<CountDoofus> Vivix: Well, it's written from Octavia's point of view. She begins to suspect Vinyl is a vampire, later developes a supernatural condition of herself, and at this point, they're at war with some sort of neighborhood watch group dedicated to eradicating the supernatural.
<Michael> Bronysith: TNG? what's that?
<Deadlypon3> What's the point of an access code if you can scan your eye?!
<SnowyFluttershy> I seriously hope the Cutie Pie Crusaders finally realise their talent's in season three. It bother's me that none of the older ponie's have realised it yet.
<mitamaking> hola everypony
<Bronysith> Michael: star trek the next generation
<CountDoofus> Deadlypon3: someone could cut out that eye?
<Nittany_Discord> Double protection layer Deadlypon3.
<Michael> hai mitamaking
<Deadlypon3> Whaateva
<CountDoofus> Haio mitamaking
<Vivix> SnowyFluttershy: the older ones know, but they have to find out themselves, and if they do they're out of the show-
<MLP_Brovakiin> hallo mitamaking
<mitamaking> DS9 huh, done with Enterprise
<Vivix> CountDoofus: Thanks! It sounds- checkout worthy, a bit highconcept but still, so was after that fateful night
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: so as you can see our current streamer wrek likes artsing and Star Trek. Sometimes also Gmod videos and various Steam games
<AJIsAwesome> SnowyFluttershy: Well, not in season 3 IMO. It removes the whole point of the CMC. Maybe in the final season.
<CountDoofus> I once met Robert Picardo. He played the doctor in Star Trek Voyager :)
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: oh, I like the doctor! :)
<SnowyFluttershy> I've never really liked star trek that much haha. I prefer fantasy to futeristic.
<SnowyFluttershy> [No offense wr3k]
<MadSurge> SnowyFluttershy: same :P
<mitamaking> What is O'Brian doing on DS9 again?
<Dovah> SnowyFluttershy: this is fantasy and futeristic tho...
<Vivix> scifi vs fantasy nerds, the eternal battle
<SnowyFluttershy> I mean like olden day's magic and myth's and stuff
<CountDoofus> Dat ship getting Discord'ed!
<Spectrum_Rush> shame that Q is only in 1 DS9 episode eh Wrek
<Wrek> aye
<Deadlypon3> Look at that Spacetalk
<Bronysith> Vivix: and TNG vs TOS nerds, the eternal battle
<Dovah> SnowyFluttershy: but that isnt futeristic...
<mitamaking> That loud ping
<Deadlypon3> It's so dense you can literally SEE IT
<mitamaking> I don't remember her on TNG
<MadSurge> I've seen at least one fanart of Discord making the cast of TNG into ponies :D
<SnowyFluttershy> Dovah: I mean I prefer that kind of olden day's fantasy to this futeristic stuff.
<Sumica> 00,10damn that bed is tall

<otakon> what's wrong Shizuka?
<otakon> Shizuka: please no, and there is no whining just /me spam
<ValtheJean> Shizu: doitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoitdoit
<Shizuka> 13that would teach them right quick about how to behave in a privately-owned community
<Major> xD
<Spectrum_Rush> dat realization

<Unnr> Shizuka: You. Are. Evil. Good Job!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh god
<Meanwhile> I have no idea what Atlas Shrugged is.
<Major> XD
<Spectrum_Rush> dis gun be gud
<alfopony> HA
<Major> O_O
<Unnr> Meanwhile, a book written by a constipated person while on the toilet that is half the basis of the American Libertarian Movement
<Malk> That sounds like paradise
<Shizuka> 13(to be fair the movie is bad but not appallingly so, compare it to the later harry potter movies, just have a lot to fit in)
<LunarSS> Meanwhile: ever play bioshock? It's what that is based off of
<Meanwhile> Really? That sounds cool.
<Meanwhile> I liked Bioshock.,
<Sumica> 00,10ah yes Home For Infinate loosers
<kirzstryfe> Shizuka: Babes in Toyland
<ValtheJean> Unnr: first off, we're talking about the movie. Second off, watch it. Some people actually like Ayn Rand
<Major> XD
<Malk> Lol
<PillowPoni> I've never heard of or seen it either.
<LunarSS> Meanwhile: The book is also painfully long
<sub06905> lol
<JRP-iPhone> Guys your whining that your not whining ......(flawless logic)
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> fecking lag
<Shizuka> 13bioshock is as based of ayn rand as harry potter is based off lord of the rings
<XylemTube> HELL > HFIL
<Meanwhile> A movie that's Bioshock-esque only sounds like a good thing.
<Spectrum_Rush> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged
<Unnr> ValtheJean: I don't mind ayn rand, but she literally wrote most of her works on the toilet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wow. Can't believe how much a sleep med killed my anxiety.
<Unnr> same with Martin Luther
<PillowPoni> It doesn't seem that bad.
<Yahooz> I heard there was a case of posterior punishment about 5 minutes ago
<PillowPoni> Nitt so you're feeling better?
<LunarSS> Shizuka: I guess 'Influenced' is a better term
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For now.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I'll take whatever youre taking Nittany
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've had trouble sleeping lately because my mind races so much at night, it keeps me up.
<Derpy_Hooves> ValtheJean: i have not had my daily dose, could you pm me the gen 3.5 scootaloo video? :3
<Yahooz> eh?
<ValtheJean> 3.6
<ValtheJean> get it right
<CriticKitten> How do you function?
<Yahooz> oh, the whining
<ValtheJean> 3.5 was good
<Kandarihu> I remember when my mind raced every night.
<Yahooz> was this seriously over RP?
<kirzstryfe> lol
<PillowPoni> Yaaaay. I would give you a hug but that requres the /me so instead ill use asterisks
<Derpy_Hooves> okay, 3.6 :3
<sub06905> :D
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Can you show this Atlas Shrugged thing at some point please?
<YourLittleDashie> ValtheJean: WAT
<Malk> lol
<Yahooz> IT NEVER ENDS >_<
<otakon> at least he doesn't drown ponies
<Shizuka> 13i've been pondering it hard
<Shizuka> 13eeeeyup
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> otakon he never said he didn't
<otakon> Shizuka: have you been at your thoughtful spot?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's funny. I thought I was done with anxiety in June. Then I get severe anxiety a few weeks later.
<Meanwhile> Of course it doesn't. Stupid never ends.
<kirzstryfe> it was more the 2 people being stupid, but they were using a lot of /me spam
<Unnr> Ayn Rand has some interesting points, even if she ultimatly was betrayed by the very tennants of Objectivism that she espoused.
<ScootaChicken> I see #bronystate hasn't changed too much since I've been absent.
<Meanwhile> You've been absent?
<Shizuka> 13xkcd gets it right, you're with rand 90% of the way, up until she settles on "therefore be a jerk to everyone"
<Phase4> 00,02your welcome
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: From #bronystate, yeah.
<sub06905> :D
<ScootaChicken> Not skype though.
<Shizuka> 13you can be self-serving and not a jerk
<MLP_Brovakiin> Nittany_Discord: Dibs on your leftover meds, I cannot sleep for shit lately
<Meanwhile> You're on Skype?
<Unnr> Shizuka, that about sums it up
<ScootaChicken> O U
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mom thinks I don't need anxiety meds.
<otakon> GENERAL MOUNTAIN!
<YourLittleDashie> I COMMAND YOU TO STREAM Bronies React to: Season 2 Finale
<IshGirlfriendlesPony> But can you block
<otakon> he just wanted a hug
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And my doctor won't give me any right now.
<thelonepony> general mountain is a good hugger
<Phase4> 00,02XD

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I can't really afford them.
<pwny> do not command ponies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01ASS
<Unnr> The problem is that through rational egoism, she tended to forget part of her own tenants in her philosophy, the whole not "sacrificing yourself to others *AND* not sacrificing others to yourself"

<CriticKitten> XD
<Shizuka> 13looking at bioshock i get the sense that galt's gulch wouldn't scale at all... it only worked because everyone there shared the same ideals, and galt put them through hell to be certain they did
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I actually do have a master's degree.

<thelonepony> XD
<Unnr> That is the problem with rapture, it relied too heavily on everyone sharing a same ideological stance, the very degredation and lack of regard for the survival of the colony shows what happens as core values change over time, but not consistantly through the population

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My fault for being lazy and not seeking work while writing my thesis.
<Malk> Nittany_Discord its fairly common now my uncle has 3 masters and cant get job so he is going back to college
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Malk: I might do the same.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I was watching Rpattz' interview on the daily show.

<Malk> Nittany_Discord but at the same time hes becoming a cop
<Unnr> it was an awesome show
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do love computer programming.
<kirzstryfe> but uncle Val, they're so shiny
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - IT is never a bad degree with the way technology is going
<sonicandmario85> caramel....

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If the market's good.
<otakon> hiya SuperBrony64 what's up man?
<sub06905> dat silly filly SuperBrony64
<Malk> Nittany_Discord I pretty much know what I want to do Ill be the guy that maintains internet and local phone lines and I shall be paid well
<Unnr> Because there is a larger % of people with a programming degree (SE, CS, ect) then with the IT degree
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo SuperBrony64
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I learned computer languages on my own. I always wanted to take formal classes in college and grad school.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wanted a doctorate in meteorology.
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - Cobol would definitely be a language to pick up. all the old programmers who know Cobol are reaching retirement age and they'll need replaced
<MirrorImage> i got an internship based on the fact i knew Cobol and damn near got a job based on it as well
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But due to untreated disabilities and a medical problem I had in 2008 - 2009, I might not be able to get one.
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am kindof glad I am taking an engineering degree, that area is so broad
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I jsut saw the new webkinz list...One of the dogs looks oike a stoner.
<Unnr> MirrorImage: I have two words for you... Cobol .NEt
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My advisors didn't seem confident that I could.
<MirrorImage> Unnr - 1 word. Mainframe.
<Unnr> MirrorImage: scarier: VAX
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They wanted to push me towards getting a masters followed by a job.
<Malk> Nittany_Discord you collect disabilities?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or career.
<MirrorImage> banks aren't going to be upgrading their stuff to Windows just because it's new - they're going to milk their ancient equipment for all its worth
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Nittany_Discord: I was reading an article in the new SI about penn state. When I saw the word nittany, I thougt of this place.
<Shizuka> 13i would rifftrax
<Shizuka> 13but sb is going now
<Shizuka> 13and would finish too late for me to start
<Meanwhile> Damnit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kawaii_icybeauti: I'm a Penn State graduate.
<Meanwhile> I was only still awake for Azkaban.
<JRP-iPhone> SuperBrony64: Aaaa Ohia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's why I have Nittany in my name.
<MirrorImage> speaking of rifftrax, what's the movies for tomorrow?
<otakon> Shizuka: oh okay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I formed my nick Nittany Tiger when I was accepted to Penn State in 2007.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Nittany_Discord: Yeah, I remember you tellign us how your name came to be.
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - please tell me if you have a kid you'll reserve the nickname Nittany_Liger for him/her
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: wat now?
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Azkaban Rifftrax would be on but apparently timing.
<JRP-iPhone> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MirrorImage: Dat Napoleon Dynamite reference.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MirrorImage: If I ever have a kid.
<MirrorImage> Kawaii_icybeauti - ...what?
<JRP-iPhone> Why no est Tom
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MirrorImage: Remember the liger part?
*Unnr is dissapearing for a bit. Thanks for the chat Shizuka. (Its fun havind random discussions on philosophy and liteary analysis)
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I dont want kids, then i have to pay for them
<MirrorImage> never watched napoleon dynamite
*MirrorImage ducks and covers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I ever have money, I want to travel to Latvia so I can ask this amazing girl I met online out.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then move there if we decide to get married.
<JRP-iPhone> Superbrony64 don't leave
<Meanwhile> Well, as long as that's the case I'm gonna go get some sleep.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> My parents met through the peace corps. Try that.
<Meanwhile> Night everyone.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, not sure if you've seen this before but http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7GT7n09zpo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01As long a Latvia isn't crappier than the US.
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: oh because is sgetting real late for you is wat you mean?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Meanwhile
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Meanwhile: dream of ponies

<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Night!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Actually it's too late to show Azkaban, but yeah it's 4:30 AM.
<Malk> I think I should join the red cross easiest job on earth
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: I have.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's awesome.
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: go sleep ya crazy brit
<Yahooz> night Me... fuck
<Yahooz> missed him
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Someone posted it in a Linked In group.
<Yahooz> theres always skype though
<thelonepony> Meanwhile http://derpibooru.org/75658?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Kandarihu: :D
<Kandarihu> I almost posted a link to it that spoils what's awesome about it and the top suggested video at the end shows a victim of a cannibal attack. Not a pleasant sight.
<MLP_Brovakiin> 4am has been my adverage bedtime for the past month and school starts in a week, I blame bronystate!
<MirrorImage> MLP_Brovakiin - blame well assigned and accepted
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: Ikr. I'm going to miss getting up at 1pm everyday :(
<sub06905> Godzilla Wednesday :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I blame my lack of sleep on my part-time job,
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, if I go back to school, I'll do one of three things: Enter a Ph.D. program, go for a bachelors in IT or computer programming, or get certified as a teacher.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> teacher certified is the backup plan for me
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kawaii_icybeauti: Haha so true I am screwed on a schoolday I wake up at 6:30am
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - go for IT. Programming slots in as a subset of that, but IT gives you a much broader range of options
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll just need to seek an internship before I graduate.
<Major> Nittany_Discord: go for bachelores in computer programming!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: Ikr. They should start school at least at like 10am. I'd be better off with that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it depends on how much I can do during school.
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - you're in central pennsylvania? definitely look at an intern with Sheetz if you can
<Malk> Nittany_Discord those feilds will be hard to get a job with
<MirrorImage> great company, and not just saying that because i work for them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. I had to move in with my grandmother back in PA.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I did apply to a Sheetz store before I left, but they never even called me back.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Trust me, it's going to go from 105 people on a weekday to like 40 something.
<MirrorImage> i don't mean a store, i mean something like the corporate offices
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I had to take one of those fucking assessment test for them.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kawaii_icybeauti: I qould be fine to drop lunch time and wake up an hour later :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> *Would
<Malk> Im telling you Telecomunications is where the mony is
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So, does anypony want to watch me make my dungeon in Minecraft? o.o
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: I want to get a free when I'm a senior in high school so I can wake up later.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yes
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Sure!
<MirrorImage> SuperBrony64 - kinky dungeon or deathly dungeon?
<Major> SuperBrony64: sure, why not? :P
<The_Browncoat> SuperBrony64: sure.
<Malk> sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Deathly dungeon o-o
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kawaii_icybeauti: same here
<Dovah> SuperBrony64: I want to watch you give me slime in minecraft...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate employment assessment test. I can pretty much forget about working at that job when I see one.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*tests
<Major> SuperBrony64: aw, I was gonna ask if I could rent it if it was kinky, oh well, I guess you dont want 500 bits.... :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Balls to it goodnight everyone :)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: Hey, you should check this little reading section out. http://www.thewaronkids.com/student.pdf
<sub06905> night MLP_Brovakiin
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Night! Sleep well.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: Remember to sing the sleep song!
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - Sheetz doesn't give those tests to be a deciding factor. It's more something that they do so supervisors have a personality idea for you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MirrorImage: Whatever. They pretty much determine if you're going to be a model employee or not.
<MirrorImage> if that were the case, i would have never gotten in
<kirzstryfe> ^
<P4ngya> what does an assessment test assess?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And since I'm an introvert, I can fucking forget about being considered when they want outgoing people.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> All this job talk is making me think that I'm a year away from legally being able to hold a job o.O
<MirrorImage> so don't apply for an "outgoing people" position?
<MirrorImage> IT isn't about human interaction
<MirrorImage> it's more about keeping the bits a flowing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm 29. I'm supposed to have a job though I've been in grad school. False expectations have helped cause me to be so anxious and depressed all of the time.
<PillowPoni> All this job talk makes me a little depressed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PillowPoni: I'll stop.
<thelonepony> time to hit the hay for me, bye http://derpibooru.org/75658?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa
<Kandarihu> You know one line of work that is desperately needed nowadays? Farmers.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I hope the economy bounds back before I have to start my job hunt.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope so too.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Kandarihu: We can work on an apple farm!
<Sebiale> Is the stream down?
<sub06905> night thelonepony
<PillowPoni> Nitt, its not you. Its just in general. I can't seem to get a job yet when I go to a store they havve different. Employees almost every single time.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really hope the economy improves.
<Kandarihu> Apples, certainly. But everything else.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Refresh embed :)
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Minecraft
<Kandarihu> It won't improve as long as Obama is in office.
<JRP-iPhone> Superbrony64 y u no check
<MirrorImage> Kandarihu - lets NOT bring politics into this...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And wealth spreads around instead of the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I was watching this thing that says that the federal reserve could be on of the major causes of the economy being sucky.
<sub06905> dat seaponies
<Dovah> heeeeey SuperBrony64 give meh all you slimez
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Greed is ruining the economy.
<JRP-iPhone> No
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, that's not how economies work.
<Shizuka> 13greed is the economy
<JRP-iPhone> Money is
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Money is everything in this "democracy" we live in
<Buytoast> greed is everything
<thelonepony> u know wait i'll stay up a bit for now
<thelonepony> wat*
<Kandarihu> This mentality that pits the rich vs the poor IS the cancer that is destroying the economy.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Since I realized that Minecraft music is boring, I'll play some Brony/Pony music >>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, when a few people hold onto the wealth instead of spending their money, it doesn't go to hard working people.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> This sounds nothing like sea ponies, I'm sorry.
<Major> Shizuka: and economy = a US Congress Man
<PillowPoni> Oh my fuck, why does it feel later than it is?????
<kirzstryfe> inb4 creeper eats SB
<somepony_else> gooooood mooooorning everypony! ;)
<PonyStationVita> its night over here
<AJ> morning? where do YOU live >_>
<AJIsAwesome> somepony_else: Hello! It's evening over here.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> somepony_else: Good morning in whatever timezone you're in o.O
<Dovah> gah! he does have slime!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't want to start a political discussion. This is not PoliticsState.
<PonyStationVita> is this pc or 360 version?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pc me thinks
<Major> Nittany_Discord: inb4 PoliticsState :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Remember the 3 things you can't talk about.
<MirrorImage> PonyStationVita - pc of course
<thelonepony> somepony_else hai http://derpibooru.org/75886?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa
<kirzstryfe> #State-Politico ? :3
<PonyStationVita> lol ok then
<Buytoast> why would you get the 360 version of minecraft?
<Buytoast> do you hate yourself that much?
<AJ> its a matter of self hate?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ~yay~
<PonyStationVita> i hav ipad which really stinks :*(
<Dovah> Buytoast: U u give me yo slime!
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, SuperBrony64 isn't much of a PC gamer
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I mostly watch Minecraft Griefing videos whenever I watch anything about minecraft on Youtube
<TheKoreanBrony1354> good night everypony
<Kawaii_icybeauti> i saw the vid for 2 seconds.
<AJIsAwesome> TheKoreanBrony1354: Night!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> TheKoreanBrony1354: dream of ponies
<somepony_else> good night TheKoreanBrony1354
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Minecraft on the PC is waaaaay better than the 360 version >>
<PonyStationVita> 3rd fav song
<Kawaii_icybeauti> 4th for me
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hugs AJIsAwesome PaladinDrakkenwolf somepony_else
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't hate the 360 so much if they didn't lock the console down tighter than Fort Knox and make you pay to do 80% of the things on that console.
<Major> SuperBrony64: pft, you should see the Iphone version :P
<Spademagnes[R]> What version of MC is the 360 anyway?
<PillowPoni> God I'm so bored and my computer is broken. I'm going to browse Reddit on the phone. Be back later
<thelonepony> now i must go, my sleep needs me
<PonyStationVita> heres my opinion PC>360>Ipan/Iphone
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lava dripping from the ceiling
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And forced almost all DLC to be paid.
<Major> ZAMBIES!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I never got the point of this game. It's cubes....
<Spademagnes[R]> Wait you dont get the full version if you buy it Nittany_Discord ?
<PonyStationVita> Its a TARP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spademagnes[R]: Minecraft?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I dunno.
<PonyStationVita> HOUSE KEEPING
<SuperBrony64> 11,02btw, anypony who wants to play this themselves later without the secrets spoiled, please don't watch the stream :)
<Spademagnes[R]> Nittany_Discord: If thats what we're talking about, I might be a bit lost
<Phase4> 00,02security on the 360 is interesting
<Spademagnes[R]> So I might be talking out of my ass
<PonyStationVita> Any you guys watch syndicateproject
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think you can get the full version on the 360. You just can't mod it since you might have to mod your console.
<Phase4> 00,02when Nittany_Discord says 'its locked down tighter than fort knox' he meensi t
<Phase4> 00,02it '
<Shizuka> 13so kirz
<Shizuka> 13about to unleash a ton of chickens?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat color
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, that means you can't customize it with custom-made content.
<Spademagnes[R]> Just how strong is 360 security?
<Phase4> 00,02Spademagnes[R], depends
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You have to buy what Microsoft sells.
<PonyStationVita> is this classic texture pack?
<Phase4> 00,02its code signing is quite rigid
<Kawaii_icybeauti> and what song i this?
<Dovah> btw how doth i join other ppls minecraft games?
<Phase4> 00,02only a few bugs have ever been found, all patched
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With my PS3, I was able to install free MLP themes without hardware mods.
<Shizuka> 13sounds like a eurobeat
<Phase4> 00,02but if your a pirate, just flash the drive
<MirrorImage> cause it is
<PonyStationVita> i used usb with ps3 themes
<Phase4> 00,02then you can use burnt games
<Spademagnes[R]> How much is Minecraft as of now?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> oh singing telegram
<SaxyPretender> 0,14PUNCHING THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
<PonyStationVita> 25$
<PonyStationVita> i think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The PS3 went the longest time without being jailbroken.
<Spectrum_Rush> all dat emerald SuperBrony64
<Spademagnes[R]> I might get it when I get a better comp
<Spademagnes[R]> Nittany_Discord: Jailbroken ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the they pulled update 3.14 on everyone, which pissed off the hacking community.
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - because it had Linux. That's almost the first goal of "jailbreaking" a console
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<MirrorImage> yeah... THEN it was game on
<PonyStationVita> the ps3 hack thing back last year?
<MirrorImage> PonyStationVita - no, different kind of hacking
<MirrorImage> when the PS3 first came out, it had native "put your own OS" support on it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then some asshole that did an insanely-difficult jailbreak posted that he jailbroke his PS3.
<MirrorImage> i.e. you put in a Linux Live Disc, and your PS3 now runs Linux
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Sony responded by removing the OtherOS feature.
<Spademagnes[R]> Am I stupid if I think Hacking seems pointless?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which led to the PS3 being jailbroken.
<Sebiale> WTF advertisement for Russian Wives.
<PonyStationVita> Combat Arms has the most hackers in a pc game
<JRP-iPhone> SuperBrony64: jump
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: No.
<Sebiale> How do I make ti go away?
<MirrorImage> buy one?
<Spademagnes[R]> I just dont see why hacking would be benifitical to ANYONE
<somepony_else> get adblock?
<Spademagnes[R]> Its just going to bite you in the arse sooner or later
<MirrorImage> Spademagnes[R] - you obviously haven't met /b/...
<Sebiale> I keep AdBlock off so i can help contribute to good videos. :S
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: It's only beneficial to the user, IMO.
<MirrorImage> gah, my headphones!
<Shizuka> 13i hacked my kindle
<Shizuka> 13best thing i ever did
<PonyStationVita> kindle fire?
<Ryunosuke> tbh
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> what'd you make it do Shizuka?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dat bass
<Shizuka> 13no, don't want backlight
<Spademagnes[R]> Zomeh!
<MirrorImage> you had to hack a kindle to turn OFF the backlight?
<PonyStationVita> die
<Shizuka> 13kindle fire is ipad for people that can't afford ipad
<Dovah> so, say I wanna play this dungeon latter.... how would I go about joining?
<Sebiale> I use a nook
<Spademagnes[R]> Why the fuck would you hack a kindle?
<Spademagnes[R]> Its a fucking book reader
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/PvNPs.jpg so that i could make it do this
<MirrorImage> Spademagnes[R] - in cases like that, it's more on principle
<Shizuka> 13instead of ads
<Ryunosuke> when I buy a console it is MINE to do with as I see fit, if I want to use online services with said console, I have that option, but the core is that *I* bought it with *MY* money so it is *MY* property to do with as I see fit
<MirrorImage> "It's my device, i'll make it do what I want"
<Shizuka> 13^
<Spectrum_Rush> SuperBrony64: same server right?, i havent been able to log on it for a few days now
<MirrorImage> case in point, that image
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Same server :)
<Shizuka> 13my device, my rules~
<Spitfire> who's streaming? :3
<Spademagnes[R]> Hacking just seems unessicary
<Dovah> I dun know how to join server :(
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> now all you need to do it make it become self aware so then it can learn to KILL
<Ryunosuke> you cannot do the same thing with automobiles, so why do I have to do that with my PS3?
<Spademagnes[R]> I mean hacking a freaking book reader sounds stupid
<Shizuka> 13mfw sb uses essentials mod and DIDN'T turn off the tilde for nicks
<PonyStationVita> ikr

<Shizuka> 13what plugins are you running
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I just put them there for people to use :/
<Shizuka> 13other than essentials
<Ryunosuke> MirrorImage, I am talking about the ability to alter my property as I see fit
<Shizuka> 13you had better have worldedit and worldguard in there
<Shizuka> 13no worldedit..
<Shizuka> 13for shame..
<Malk> broken back mountain is on yay
<Shizuka> 13FOR SHAME
<Ryunosuke> if I want another OS on my PS3, that should be my choice, as if I want to put in another engine in my automobile, I have that choice
<Shizuka> 134SHM
<Spectrum_Rush> SuperBrony64: wat do you think of the Rainbow Dash cutiemark i made?
<Spademagnes[R]> I would never hack because, one I would most likely break shit and it usualy gets you in trouble
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I should have World Edit on here...
<PonyStationVita> this is classic texture pack
<PonyStationVita> is it
<MirrorImage> Spademagnes[R] - trouble with who? that's the point
<Shizuka> 13ja that's default textures
<somepony_else> hello mr creeper

<Spademagnes[R]> Oh hi creepers
<Shizuka> 13then you'd really wish you had worldedit for the mass entity kill
<Phase4> 00,02Spademagnes[R], the 'getting in trouble' part is what people complain about

<Major> XD
<Spademagnes[R]> Like I would cause it to stop working
<Phase4> 00,02it should not be ilicit for me to try change the software on my ps3

<Spademagnes[R]> So how deep are we?
<Spectrum_Rush> uh Shizuka ...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Pretty much everyone has creative Shizuka, kirzstryfe just only entered the server.
<Phase4> 00,02Spademagnes[R], you learn much more from breaking something than you do from doing something right

<Shizuka> 13Spademagnes[R]: to render a device into such a state that it is more useful as a brick than it is whatever it is

<Dovah> SuperBrony64: how I join servers?
<HoodyNinja> What is he making?
<spartan133t> Dovah: 1. enter server ip

<Dovah> HoodyNinja: it has 3 of the fattest cities in america including the first and thrid....
<HoodyNinja> Dovah: But that doesnt mean everyone is fat

<HoodyNinja> Spademagnes[R]: but we are
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I'm a stick
<Dovah> HoodyNinja: means everyone in those cities and everyone within 20 miles is fat.
<TheKatPony> its mostly true, though.
<TheKatPony> lots of fat people here.
<HoodyNinja> Theres a stereotype in arkansas that everyone is either an inbred racist or involved in gangs, and its all true
<Dovah> ^lol
<Spademagnes[R]> Sigh...
<HoodyNinja> Im not kidding
<Dovah> Wisconsin: It's too cold to be sober.

<HoodyNinja> So, 1000 inmates that are in there for similar reasons want to kill him?
<Spademagnes[R]> Pfff.. really?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14You'd be surprised
