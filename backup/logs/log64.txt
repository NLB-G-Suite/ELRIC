<prince-dari> Do you want Luna, but don't feel like waiting until August 1st for the release? Apparently the fine workers over at Target are more than happy to completely ignore the street date, assuming you give them the item code to look the stuff up with.
<prince-dari> Have some copypaste from the ponychan thread. These codes are meant for the pad things the employees carry around, so make sure to find one that looks important enough for a "hand code thingy"!

<Dman> http://www.mediafire.com/?tg69mhqxh6mc27r download and view =]
<Dman> pics of screencaps from y/day's marathon
<Dman> Prince-dari what are you insinuating ?
<Dman> I semi read half the comments bjornfot had
<Dman> i wanna know exactly what he said about me : 0
<Bjornfot> lolwut
<prince-dari> I was just inferring from your implications...:2,15
<Bjornfot> What comments?
<Dman> i said
<Dman> . . . dayum. I gotta reread it now D:
<Dman> at some point...later...
<prince-dari> The comment I was inferring from was this one:
<prince-dari> [12:15] <Dman> at some point...later...
<prince-dari> :P
<Dman> and prince-dari thinks this means i'll be printing the story off and locking myself in the toilet or something
<Bjornfot> how quaint
<Dman> YES
<Dman> STREAMING BILL HAS BEEN AXED
<Bjornfot> fuck yeah
<prince-dari> Lol, I wanted to see them try and enforce it.
<prince-dari> Because that would have failed so badly.
<Bjornfot> Now you just have to legalize torrents and you'll almost be as good as glorious Sweden!
<Dman> yea, but the few they might have made an example of would have been like :(
<prince-dari> Woo
<prince-dari> Outnumbered.
<Dman> OUTNUMBERED
<prince-dari> I love this show.
<Dman> it's time!
<Dman> prince, is it just me, or can you always think of a million things the parents could say? don't you just wanna reach and slap them?
<prince-dari> I was kind of surprised to find out that the kids make up most of their lines.
<Bjornfot> @too_quietmeter The stream
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The stream is 31% too_quiet. (858)
<prince-dari> They just have a vague guideline, then make up their lines themselves.
<Bjornfot> dari, fix your volume. nao
<prince-dari> It's not possible.
<Bjornfot> eeyup
<prince-dari> Unless I get a new sound card or something.
<Bjornfot> *amplifier*
<prince-dari> Yeah, the amplifier would be a function of the sound card.
<Dman> LOOOOUDEEEER
<prince-dari> Mine doesn't have it.
<prince-dari> So I'd need to get a new sound card.
<Bjornfot> uh, no
<Dman> eh, it's fine. i could still hear 'PLAYGUUUUU' :P
<prince-dari> Uh, yes. :P
<Bjornfot> you can intercept and manipulate the output sound with a virtual amplifier
<prince-dari> MFW I checked and was told that's impossible.
<Bjornfot> it is?
<prince-dari> I dunno, I was told you can't do it with software.
<Bjornfot> Not if the output goes to your speakers or so
<Dman> prince-dari do you have any idea when FiM airs on tv?
<prince-dari> In the UK?
<prince-dari> Ages ago.
<Dman> started? : 0
<prince-dari> 4th of July
<Bjornfot> but you can do it with the sound that goes to the streaming tool
<prince-dari> Then every day from then on other than weekends.
<Dman> have you seen any? I mean, are they identical the the ones I will already have?
<prince-dari> Hmm, I think my 2TB hard drive just turned up at the door.
<Dman> !
<Bjornfot> The streaming tool intercepts, copies and broadcasts the output sound. You could have a program that intercepts the virtual sound before it reaches the streaming tool, manipulates it, and forwards it to the streaming tool, which will think it's the real sound.
<prince-dari> Well if you still think it's possible, go find a program that does that. :P
<Dman> is there any difference with the UK and US show?
<Bjornfot> It's probably not easy, but it should work in theory.
<Bjornfot> FUCK
<Bjornfot> MY EARS
<Bjornfot> >have headset on
<prince-dari> Dman: Nope.
<Dman> ok
<Dman> i'll focus all mah efforts in finding the spanish dub now
<Bjornfot> >set colume to max since the stream is derp
<Dman> >hear it just about
<Dman> : /
<Bjornfot> >extract rar
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Bjornfot> >forget I have the nyancat prograss bar plugin
<Bjornfot> >NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN NYAN right into my fucking ears at full volume
<prince-dari> Lol, ears.
<prince-dari> BLOWN.
<Dman> i had that for like a day
<Dman> so you have a 2TB?
<prince-dari> Nah, turns out it was something else.
<Bjornfot> ...why would one need 2TB?
<prince-dari> To put stuff on maybe?
<Bjornfot> what stuff
<Bjornfot> porn?
<Dman> aww what was it?
<prince-dari> 100s of films/games/programs/etc.
<Dman> Yea prince-dari's right
<Bjornfot> films? pfft
<Dman> i have a 1TB and it's about 80% filled and im still getting more stuff constantly
<prince-dari> Handheld GPS.
<Dman> such as 1080p MOVIAS 10GIGAS
<Dman> per movie
<Dman> prince-dari likes his tech? : )
<prince-dari> Not mine, my dad must have ordered it.
<prince-dari> But I do like my tech, yes. :P
<prince-dari> Bjornfot: A single PS3 game tends to be about 30 GB.
<Dman> =]
<Dman> also that
<prince-dari> 10 of them = 300 GB.
<Dman> games
<Dman> i have 200GB of wii vidya on my WBFS partition
<Dman> also though tprince-dari 'scrub' the ps3 games
<Dman> sometimes they can be like 5GB but the file has 20GB of nothing
<prince-dari> If you think no one would ever need 2TB Bjornfot, you massively underestimate my ability collect a hell of a lot of stuff.
<Dman> I may need a 2TB but i have a 1TB so not sure if buy 1 or 2tb for 2nd harddrive
<Dman> >watching 'meet Rarity' on hasbro.com/es_es aka Spain.
<Dman> >hear 'Rarity dreams of designing the princess a beautiful dress oneday.
<Dman> Da foque?
<Dman> i can forgive the 'celestia only alicorn' bit i guess
<prince-dari> Is alicorn a fan term?
<Dman> yea but i meant
<McCloud> prince-dari: nope
<Dman> the vid said 'only one with a magical horn AND wings'
<prince-dari> I thought it was McCloud?
<Dman> that's ifne cuz ep1 luna on moon
*McCloud has a 20TB RAID 6 array
<prince-dari> It's not mentioned in any MLP episode.
<Dman> but i can't believe I heard that about rarity
<Dman> still watching the other 'meet the's
<Dman> oh god in the english one it said pinkie loved visiting sugarcube corner D: doesn't she live there?
<Dman> aaaadn yup same in spanish 'loves visiting for sweets'
<Dragoran> !pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> Dragoran, you are a 6Meowth.
<prince-dari> Lol fail.
<Dman> oh, hasbro
<Dman> yay AJ for best meetthe video
<prince-dari> Ok, I think THIS package is my hard drive.
<Dman> : D
*Dman wiped a bead of sweat off his brow. his hands were shaking. It was Time. He brought the radio up to his ear, the receiver next to his mouth, and he said only
*Dman 'The package is ready.'
<Dman> !
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> A 2TB drive only holds 240 hours of HD video.
<Dman> So says the box. you listen to that sh*t?
<Dman> DURRR 'HD video'
<Dman> define 'HD video,' oh bauwx
<prince-dari> I'd assume 1080p :P
<Dman> Well even then eyedunno
<prince-dari> Ashes to Ashes?
<prince-dari> Nice.
<Dman> depends on quality of this 1080p video, and compression within the files, and so much more even I don't know about >_<
<Bjornfot> the 1080p pony hdtv rips are 745-746 MiB each
<Dman> hmm
<Dman> Yup same, yea they are
<Bjornfot> and are 22 minutes +- one second
<Dman> and they're mkv rite?
<Bjornfot> eeyup
<Bjornfot> x264
<Dman> if they were avi they'd be like 1GB and if they were eyedunno mp4 they'd probably be like 1.2GB
<Dman> !
<Bjornfot> >mp4 larger than avi
<prince-dari> Pony HD doesn't really count as HD.
<prince-dari> :P
<Bjornfot> i don't think so tim
<prince-dari> Since you can't really get HD vectors.
<Dman> 720p colourcorrected are like 720MB
<Dman> preetee big
<Bjornfot> yeah, it's kinda derp how the 720ps are almost as big as 1080
<Dman> ack i meant avimp4 other way bjornfot just reread it >_<
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF MUSIC
<Bjornfot> doesn't the 720ps use the same codecs, though?
<prince-dari> MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
<prince-dari> OH YEAH
<prince-dari> LOL
<Dman> welp i have 1080p, 720p colourcorrected all nice and pretty, 720p again in mp4 so as to be able to edit them
<Dman> and 240p for mah iPod classic
<Dman> =]
<Dman> bjornfot idunno
<Bjornfot> at least the non-color corrected ones
<Dman> but I find the ones i have for 720p are KAWAIIIII~~~~~desu on my 1080p LED telly
<Dman> i prefer the 720p to 1080p even for watching on big resolution displays
<Bjornfot> really now
<Bjornfot> the only advantage with 1080p is no marks
<Bjornfot> *720
<Dman> well, lemme screencap a comparison in COLOUR ofc, not resolution quality, just t oshow what I mean =]
<Dman> :O yea 720p are unmarked not 1080 >_<
<Bjornfot> I can't wait for the Blu-ray set to come out so we can have unmarked 1080...
<Bjornfot> inb4 they only release 720p DVDs
<Dman> bjornfot how about I slap their sh*t!
<Dman> http://i.imgur.com/o5sb3.png
<Dman> ok the comparison i made in a jiffy here sucks a little : /
<Dman> and you can't compare resolution
<Dman> but on the right is 720p with mediaplayerclassic so as to use the gamma/colour files with the vid
<Dman> theres a teenie tiny difference in that the right looks a tiny bit more colourful - in motion the difference is a little bigger
<Dman> on an LED TV it made me smile when I compared the two - it's noticable :P
<Dman> wait WAT
<prince-dari> ?
<Dman> youtube has REACTIONS?
<prince-dari> Reactions?
<Bjornfot> where did you get those 720ps, Dman?
<prince-dari> Ponychan
<Dman> prince-dari look at youtube
<Dman> look at comments !
<Dman> bjornfot
<Dman> um

<Bjornfot> Nintendo owned E3 again.
<prince-dari> Sony should have been bottled.
<D_man> only E3 EVER that is worse is sony's 2006...wanna see ? :P
<Bjornfot> It's kind of funny how Nintendo, who started the wholoe wagglefest, are now the ones who are saving the gaming industry.

<Bjornfot> >doesn't rexofnize black people
<prince-dari> At least Kinect is something vaguely different, even if I'd never use it.

<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeixtYS-P3s
<prince-dari> Were you an olympic standard swimmer by the way?
<Dman> he is a brilliant man and I love him so
<Bjornfot> Man skulle kunna säga... att hennes forskning... *Sunglasses* var strålande.
<Dman> Yes prince-dari ^_^
<Dman> well, as in it was 'olympic standard' training
<prince-dari> Wow, that's very impressive.
<Dman> and some people are now doing it
<Dman> aww, thanks :3
<Bjornfot> i don't think that pun can eb translated to english :/
<Dman> stopped around GCSE times
<prince-dari> God, you must be really fit, how often did you say you swam?
<Dman> forskning = multiple meanings right?
<Dman> aww :3 well prince i guess i am kinda =]
<GGgala> >1. stop talking about racism. 2. ??? 3. Racism over?
<Dman> 5 times for like years, except sometimes on holiday
<Dman> tue and thur 5am to 7am, then to school
<Bjornfot> No, dman.
<Dman> fri and sun at night
<Dman> and saturday 5-8 SATURDAY WAS HELL
<prince-dari> Damn, that sounds tough.
<Dman> cuz the guy incharge was there and he'd do stuff like ONE HOUR OF instead of 'do this km and rest'
<Bjornfot> Translated: You could say... that her research... *sunglasses* was strålande.
<Bjornfot> stårlande means both radiating and brilliant
<Dman> THIS IS THE MOST PAIN I@VE EVER HAD - ONE HOUR OF 100m BUTTERFLY WITH 10 SECONDS REST BETWEEN EACH D: (he had a trollface. clear as day.)
<prince-dari> Eugh, butterfly.
<prince-dari> Worst stroke. :P
<Bjornfot> shutterfly
<Dman> it was very very painful : /
<Dman> lol
<Dman> my least fave stroke yea
<Dman> most people prefer freestyle aka front crawl
<prince-dari> So did you decide to stop yourself, or did your parents tell you to or something?
<Dman> i think i prefered it too. but i was best at breaststroke, IMO because others just were'nt good at it. it's what I got 5th in at 13 y/o in england. a comp that happened just near Wales =]
<Dman> Prince-dari i wanted to, and my parents are divorced so only my mum had control, and she didn't want me to : /
<prince-dari> That's really a shame. :2,15(
<Bjornfot> Why do people work out and stuff, anyway?
<Bjornfot> I can see why Americans need to, but...
<Dman> It was nice, but i wanted to try out different stuff. i did foot ball and badminton for about 2 years till recently and now i don't do anything and go on runs for the mo till i find something
<Dman> u know like on sat i left for a little bit for the run ;D
<prince-dari> Haha, I've always hated running, though I went for a short run yesterday.
<Dman> prince-dari : ( i wasn't planning to be an olympic swimmer aniways it was my sport, my outlet and a big part of my life i guess, but it's not rly a shame : (
<prince-dari> Legs still haven't recovered yet today.
<prince-dari> XD
*Dman brohoofs prince-dari
*prince-dari brohoofs Dman
<Bjornfot> :I
<Bjornfot> silly brits
<prince-dari> Pff. :P
<prince-dari> Silly Bjornfot.
<prince-dari> Doesn't like water.
<Dman> the best part is actually coming home and not realising you've ran, not realising you're getting fitter or whatever, but realising you're not part of society's little game of impression, that you can go on a run in broad daylight passing walkers and don't giveafuck
<Dman> that's the best feeling :3
<Bjornfot> I never lift my butt from the computer chair and I'm 190cm & 55kg.
<Dman> but ofcourse on saturday at 2am noones up xP
<Dman> Bjornfot you could start with something small and work your way to more strenuous work! you can do it, it just takes mootivation
<Dman> that's the only thing that ever stopped anyone
<Dman> motivation : /
<Bjornfot> how about no
<prince-dari> Motivation is easy when it's something you enjoy.
<Dman> heck, if you're happy with how you are do what you want cuz a pirate is free = ]
<Bjornfot> i DON'T enjoy physical excercise.
<Bjornfot> I have a neat quote from one of my childhood friends:
<Dman> i kinda enjoy it but sometimes i really don't want to do it
<Bjornfot> "Any physical activity that doesn't lead to orgasm is unnecessary."
<prince-dari> What if it's fun?
<Dman> also, prince-dari, i still feel awkward about this, but trust me - if you have a large enough bathroom, do some pressups while the water heats up as fast as you can till you collapse
<Bjornfot> >physical activity
<Bjornfot> >fun
<Dman> then you jump in the shower while your sweat breaks up
<Dman> =D
<Bjornfot> silly brits.
<Dman> hahaha bjornfot nice quote
<Dman> >is 100% spanish confirmed for at least 5 generations
<Bjornfot> OH GOD pressups
<prince-dari> Exercise release endorphins.
<Dman> just moved to england after a divorce
<Bjornfot> pain
<Dman> HAPPY CHEMIKUL
<prince-dari> They are like natures FUN HAPPY DRUGZ.
<Dman> : D
<prince-dari> nature's*
<prince-dari> That's why Bjornfot. :P
<prince-dari> It makes you feel good.
<Bjornfot> i tried to do some push ups ones
<Bjornfot> *once
<Bjornfot> didn't end well
<Dman> it won't
<Dman> do it again
<Dman> and again

<Dman> to be honest i've never felt any sort of rush from endorphins but when i DON'T do exercise i can get a little depressed. overdose i guess : P
<Dman> is this you bjornfot?
<Bjornfot> yes.
<Dman> or something similar that happened to you?
<Dman> oh it is :3
<Dman> ok i'm watching it
<Bjornfot> Some furry on MSN dared me to.
<Dman> hahaha
<Dman> you're shaking and your arms look not too muscley, so it just takes time of doing this everyday
<prince-dari> I see a box in the background.
<Dman> the worst part for me at least like is is the awkward/shyness about it. i don't want anyone seeing me do it >_<
<Dman> with a ps2/3 controller on
<Bjornfot> my dad walked in on me in this vid.
<Dman> and a gee-tar
<Dman> tell him you're doing exercise. like a ba-WHY
<prince-dari> How old are you Dman, I've forgotten?
<Dman> I JUST GOT RICKROLLED BY BJORNFOT =[
<Dman> 17!
<Dman> stopped at gcse (swimming) at 15ish
<prince-dari> So you're in sixth form now (unless you dropped out)?
<Dman> and 2 years now stopped badminton / football (/cycling i guess?) and now i'm not doing much more than runnan

<Dman> Chemistry - dem orders of reaction
<Bjornfot> >biology
<Dman> did you say you were prince?
<prince-dari> LOLNO
<prince-dari> Wait.
<Dman> i think RBD was in upper sixth just finished
<prince-dari> ...
<Bjornfot> biology stopped being fun when they went from animals to humans
<prince-dari> MFW I misread what you said
<Dman> bjornfot yes biology is shit
<prince-dari> I thought you said "Did you say you were a prince?".
<Dman> one year was half on humanbodyhowitworksILOVETHISSTUFF and half 'durr plants use teh sun ok brahs?#
<Bjornfot> geneology is pretty neat though, was my fav part
<Dman> lol prince-dari
<Dman> =]
<Dman> and so far this year it's 'HURR plants grow then come small animals then big ones. remember kids plants insects animals you can't have an animal in a habitat with no sustainablefoodsource-NO FUCKING SHIT'
<Dman> so yea i'm disliking biology
<Dman> but chemistry almost mai waifu :3
<Dman> geneology is awesome, later this year i learn it
<Bjornfot> animal anatomy is king
<Dman> (but i learned already outside of school cuz i was bored iwth class)
<Bjornfot> and evolution
<Dman> chromosams unt chromatids
<Dman> : D
<Dman> centromeres and um what else
<Bjornfot> i know more about all kind of animals reproductive organs and behaviours then what's healthy
<Dman> uh forgot a bit of it as I say we haven't been taught it yet
<prince-dari> I'm doing maths, physics, chemistry, and further maths when I come back to school.
<Dman> bjornfot - i love human biology i'm only semi interested in animals : /
<Dman> Prince-dari you entering 6th form or upper?
<prince-dari> Sixth form
<prince-dari> Year 12
<Dman> also nice choice and also I AM FUKKEN JELLY!
<Dman> I WANT TO DO MECHANICS 2!!!!!!! (protip:you do it, but i don't as i didn't do further)
<Bjornfot> what are these silly form you babble about
<Dman> one of my friends rubs this in my face everyday
<Dman> that he gets to do the mechanics 2 course
<Dman> Bjornfot British education system
<Dman> 2 years of 'le 6thform' then uni
<Dman> it's how it works
<Dman> and 6th form you do 3 or 4 subjects
<prince-dari> I think we're through the entire playlist now.
<Bjornfot> why don't you just say grade x
<Dman> lol now what
<Dman> but but
<Dman> ok
<prince-dari> Dunno.
<Dman> we have years
<Dman> so liek grades-
<Dman> year 0 to 6 (first 7) is 'primary school'
<Bjornfot> lol, 0?
<Dman> year 7 to 11 is 'secondary school'
<prince-dari> I didn't have a year 0. :P
<Dman> yea year 0 or 'reception' :P
<Dman> prince-u didn't miss much
<prince-dari> Hah.
<Dman> once uve done year 11 (at 16) you can leave
<Dman> you can job
<Bjornfot> Sweden has grade=years
<prince-dari> You can job.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Dman> you can college wihch HUGELY lowers potential jobs and in england college is for the ones withou....well the failures xP
<Dman> dont' wanna be mean but that's how it sorta is
<Bjornfot> Grade 1-9, primary school
<Dman> #OR after year 11
<prince-dari> Wait, what's wrong with college?
<Dman> you can do '6th form'
<Dman> prince-dari well you do less stuff right?
<prince-dari> Nope?
<Dman> 6th form tends to be a far better option for uni
<prince-dari> My sister went to a college, and she's very intellegent.
<Bjornfot> Grade 10-12 (or ring 1-3), speicalised "Gymnasium" secondary school
<Dman> Yes some can
<Dman> sorry i should explain it
<Dman> um
<Dman> there's less options for college BUT certain options are insanely hard and u can do thru college
<prince-dari> Hmm, there's a wider range of choice at the colleges near me.
*Dman is listening to bjornfot sing the cutie mark crusaders.
<prince-dari> I have very limited choice at the sixth form in my school.
<Dman> OH OF course! it would depend where you go : /
<prince-dari> Compared to most other places.
<Bjornfot> oh gawd i have a new creepy fan D:
<Dman> there's 2 colleges near ME, and that's
<prince-dari> Around where I live any way.
<Dman> bournemouth college and pool college' both have sodall to offer here : /
<Dman> yes prince-dari it depends where you live of ocurse
<Dman> for me colleges here don't offer much
<Dman> but there's like 4 good secondary schools. one is mainly art school, one is mainly Tech, one is mixed of all
<Dman> and the one i go to is languages
<Bjornfot> woo sathi
<Dman> i stayed in the 'languages' one but i did sciences aniways cuz i can
<prince-dari> Ohai Sathi.
<Dman> Hey Sathi =]
<Sathi> hello people
<Dman> we were just discussing our educashun
<Sathi> 7oh interesting
<Dman> bjornfot- maybe
<prince-dari> Couldn't you still get back into swimming Dman?
<prince-dari> Or does missing a couple of years really make a huge difference?
<Dman> prince-dari yea i could and i've thought about it, but I preferred to learn about science than to train for events ... if you kno wwht i mean
<Dman> i liked both but preferred one
<prince-dari> Ah, ok.
<Dman> Prince-dari it won't make difference in terms of strength, i've made sure of that, but it would take a month or 2 to get the techniques fine again
<Bjornfot> 7th Element of Harmony: The Element of Surprise
<Dman> once you train even forr just half a year! you can't get any faster
<Dman> it's ALL about the technique
<Dman> and stuff
<prince-dari> WOO FRANKIE BOYLE!
<Dman> how you take your turns, when you breathe, conserving energy and oxygen with only necessary movement ect
<Dman> BOYLE!

<Nittany_Tiger> I must have been awfully exhausted from work yesterday to fall asleep without parting the channel.
<AlCapony> I guess so.
<Dman> get sleep. you need sleep =]
<Nittany_Tiger> It's noon. I still have 3 hours of work left. Not happening. I'm just home on lunch break.
<Destructor236> Hi everybrony!
<Dman> hey destructor236 again! ^_^
<Destructor236> Yo,Dman!
<Dman> =]
<Nittany_Tiger> did you guys see? Sony trolled EU by pricing the PlayStationVita at 250 $ and 250 Euro. 250 euro is $364 <- I think corporations ignore exchange rates on purpose, hoping people are dumb enough to do the same.
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, game manufacturers/pubishers.
<Destructor236> Damn that's expensive!
<Nittany_Tiger> *publishers.
<Sathi> 7yea steam does that too..
<Sathi> 7 1 dollar = 1 euro
<Nittany_Tiger> = one british pound.
<Nittany_Tiger> = Australian dollar (maybe)
<Dman> Nittany_tiger isn't that what I said word for word? did you copy it ? :3
<Nittany_Tiger> Activision does it with CoD
<Sathi> 7blizzard does it too
<Nittany_Tiger> I did. I didn't want to highlight you, so I didn't copy your name.
<Dman> : D I feel happee ^_^
<Dman> Yes, what the hell sony?
<Nittany_Tiger> Activision and Blizzard are both headed by Kotick, a person that makes Eugene Krabs look generous.
<Destructor236> Is it Black Ops you're talkin' about when you said CoD?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger> Also MW2.
<Dman> Call of duty elite
<Nittany_Tiger> Call of Duty: Milk the Fanbase Even More.
<Dman> >pay for console. >if 360 pay for xbox live too if psn option to play for psn+ >pay for game >NOW pay for game's exclusive multiplayer?
<Nittany_Tiger> That's should be the true name for it.
<Destructor236> Black Ops wins in my book because it has Machete,Freddy and Buffy.
<Dman> nittany_tiger the title of the next game :P
<Sathi> 7Do not like Kotick.jpg
<Nittany_Tiger> Dman: MP is still free. Just some stuff gets put under a subscription fee.
<Dman> Yes i know i did my homework
<Dman> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> It'll go pay to play eventually, though.
<Dman> know what else is being milked? Assassin's creed =[ AC1 was amazing
<Dman> know what isn't? ZELDA! why wub zewda. cannot wait for skyward sword
<Destructor236> Admire the epicness!http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DtMjxIkvezs/Ti4piujTpCI/AAAAAAAAJNk/ZTLVGtqVdmg/s1600/transformares_rainbow_dash_by_inspectornills-d41m2fv.jpg
<Sathi> 7looking forward to D3 though
<Nittany_Tiger> Kotick and Activision are just creeping MP subscription fees in. First charge for some parts of MP, then charge for it all.
<Dman> destructor236, there's pinkie somewhere too of that!
<Destructor236> Transformer Dash is epic Dash.
<Dman> Dash dash is best Dash : D
<Destructor236> lol
<Destructor236> Me no like Zelda.Is me normal?
<Dman> Errybody has to have opinions! That's fine by me :P
<Dman> It's my favourite vidya franchise by the way, just to let ya know
<Destructor236> Well,i did like the first Zelda game and Spirit Tracks.
<Dman> I loved spirit tracks - the music with headphones for a DS game was incredible, especially the overworld theme
<Destructor236> Hell yea it was!
<Destructor236> It was DY-NO-MITE.
<Nittany_Tiger> Alright. Back to work. Cya. Will be back later.
<Destructor236> Cya nittany!
<Dman> bie bie nittany_tiger don't over do it >_<

<Dman> well, enjoy the now
<Polarfire> I am :)
<Polarfire> I'm celebrating by doing nothing all week XD
<Dman> why wub this qwote: Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.
<Dman> of course, only works in English, but still
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> I have a good one
<Dman> shoot
<Polarfire> "Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence.
<Polarfire> And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so.
<Dman> I love that one! CS lewis for the win
<Polarfire> Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up." -C.S. Lewis
<Dman> : P thanks for posting it all

<drfsupercenter> 03which is really odd as this is like a super fancy LED backlit monitor XD
<Dashite> Indeed

<Dusky> 06but the iPad 2 is preferable
<drfsupercenter> 03HyperMetalLugia, yep.
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here
<abronylikeyou> 0I made that picture.
<Pattyrick> Ok, and that's fine
<drfsupercenter> 03VMWare
<drfsupercenter> 03;P
<HyperMetalLugia> What can you run on OSX
<HyperMetalLugia> that you can't run on Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03no that's what I mean
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Dashite> Thrashers fan?
<Dusky> 06HML
<Pattyrick> the iPod touch is kinda blah, I have to admit
<Dusky> 06absolutly nothing
<Pattyrick> as a pure MP3 player
<abronylikeyou> 0The thrashers moved to winnipeg.
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait, blah
<junh1024-XD> Logic & Final Cut
<drfsupercenter> 03If I want to use GarageBand (why would I WANT to?)
<abronylikeyou> 0Yes.
<drfsupercenter> 03I could run OSX using VMWare
<junh1024-XD> & GB
<drfsupercenter> 03and do it in a window
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03I even have sound working
<Dashite> I've been following the news.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is... kinda hard to do
<drfsupercenter> 03;P
<Pattyrick> the newer Nanos are blah as well
<junh1024-XD> the iLife suite, but nm else is worth it
<drfsupercenter> 03my sister actually LIKES the new Nanos
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, I meant- What Windows software can't run on a mac xD
<Pattyrick> I liked my 4th gen Nano, that was fine
<Dashite> Habs fan myself. Sucks for the fans in Atlanta.
<HyperMetalLugia> EW
<Pattyrick> yuck :\
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<HyperMetalLugia> The Nanos were...decent
<HyperMetalLugia> All I can say
<drfsupercenter> 03as for the iPads... there are definitely better tablets out there
<HyperMetalLugia> The 1st one SUCKED
<drfsupercenter> 03Motorola Xoom anyone?
<abronylikeyou> 0we still have the Hawks though
<drfsupercenter> 03cheaper, does 4G,e tc etc
<Pattyrick> That should NOT have been the replacement for the Nano
<Pattyrick> and blah
<HyperMetalLugia> Lapblet anyone?
<Dusky> 06i like the idea of the NEW Cloudsystem they release with iOS 5
<Pattyrick> I don't like the Xoom
<drfsupercenter> 03EW THE CLOUD
<abronylikeyou> 0http://www.sportslogos.net/images/logos/6/220/thumbs/5mdhgjh3aa92kih09pgi.gif
<drfsupercenter> 03See
<drfsupercenter> 03The cloud is totally like
<HyperMetalLugia> CLouds suck
<drfsupercenter> 03a concept that they had since the 1870s
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<HyperMetalLugia> I like GROUND
<drfsupercenter> 031970s
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<Pattyrick> I used one and I didn't see it as that impressive
<drfsupercenter> 03that is now being re-invented
<drfsupercenter> 03it's dumb
<abronylikeyou> 0Their alt logo is better.
<Dusky> 06i said
<Dusky> 06NEW cloud
<HyperMetalLugia> Was it created by Kevin Flynn?
<Dashite> Don't you have a baseball team too?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Dusky> 06xDDD
<drfsupercenter> 03New cloud is an oxymoron.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or whoever he was

<HyperMetalLugia> Clouds are recycled
<drfsupercenter> 03and I Mean
<HyperMetalLugia> Just like water
<Dashite> Yeah, them.
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you not want your data stored on YOUR DEVICE?
<drfsupercenter> 03You'd rather have it floating around online where any hacker can get it?
<Pattyrick> convenience
<HyperMetalLugia> Sure

<HyperMetalLugia> patty
<drfsupercenter> 03Need I remind you all of the fact that AT&T was hacked and lots of data was stolen
<drfsupercenter> 03;P
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<abronylikeyou> 0Oldest team in the MLB.
<Dusky> 06but iPad has a good idea
<drfsupercenter> 03how is a hard drive not more convenient
<junh1024-XD> cloud goes down, it's not under your control, data goes poof.
<Pattyrick> Just access from anywher
<Dusky> 06DROPBOX!
<drfsupercenter> 03No sitting and waiting for something to load
<junh1024-XD> it has happened before.
<HyperMetalLugia> How is it conveient to not have local storae
<drfsupercenter> 03I do dropbox from my Android...
<Pattyrick> because you can't plug it into your iPad/Pod/Phone
<Dusky> 06DROPBOX WITH ONLY 1GB INSTEAD OF MY FREE 2GB!!
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<HyperMetalLugia> Blah
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey Dusky
<HyperMetalLugia> I can store over 300GB of stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno, I don't see any redeeming quality to the iPad
<HyperMetalLugia> On my laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> For free
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03same
<HyperMetalLugia> Without internet
<HyperMetalLugia> WITHOUT INTERNET
<abronylikeyou> 0http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Winnipeg_Jets_2011.jpg
<HyperMetalLugia> See :3
<drfsupercenter> 03and if you want to access it from the Internet
<drfsupercenter> 03just run a ftpserver
<Dusky> 06i can WITH
<drfsupercenter> 03or httpserver
<drfsupercenter> 03off your computer
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<abronylikeyou> 0Which one is the best, IMO
<abronylikeyou> 0?
<Pattyrick> While lack of USB support is blah, I think it's nice if you have multiple devices to have something that automatically syncs their information
<drfsupercenter> 03speaking of which I need to install my HTTP server again but I'll do it later
<abronylikeyou> 0My favorite is the text logo.
<drfsupercenter> 03Pattyrick
<Dusky> 06i use it for pictures, handy if you're everywhere
<drfsupercenter> 03with Android, all your information is stored on Google
<Pattyrick> Yes?
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's built in
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Dashite> The text logo? Ewww.
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Google is evil
<drfsupercenter> 03pictures, well, how many fricking cameras do you need?
<HyperMetalLugia> One billion
<Pattyrick> Well then why are you hating on cloud? :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Including your 10 phones
<HyperMetalLugia> 30 MP3 players
<drfsupercenter> 03because, my phone does not use the cloud
<abronylikeyou> 0The airplane (or aeroplane) one is the worst IMO
<abronylikeyou> 0not the left onwe
<drfsupercenter> 03the only thing that's stored on Google is account information
<drfsupercenter> 03contacts, settings, etc
<drfsupercenter> 03your actual data is stored locally
<abronylikeyou> 0the hockey stick one
<Dashite> I do wish they hadn't used the F-18 on the logo.
<Pattyrick> if they hack into your account, they could steal that
<Dusky> 06brb~
<drfsupercenter> 03yes but this is Google we're talking about
<Pattyrick> and it's a different concept, not the same kind of thing
<Dusky> 06ohai Hawkie
<Hawkie> 07Rar!
<Pattyrick> Hi Hawkie
<drfsupercenter> 03Zip!
<Hawkie> 07Hi. :>
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think people are going to hack Google anytime soon :P
<Pattyrick> they could
<Pattyrick> Who knows
<abronylikeyou> 0this rules though
<abronylikeyou> 0http://www.sgclark.com/blog/assets/TRODAT_JETS.jpg
<Pattyrick> Did you think they'd hack PSN?
<HyperMetalLugia> They already hacked Apple?
<HyperMetalLugia> Sorta
<drfsupercenter> 03lots of people thought they'd hack PSN
<HyperMetalLugia> Who likes the PS3?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03because Sony is a pathetic pile of crap
<Dashite> No. The official one is better.
<drfsupercenter> 03so they deserved it
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Pattyrick> I never heard of it before
<abronylikeyou> 0yeah
<Pattyrick> I'm sure that a big company like Google has great security, but that doesn't mean people aren't trying
<Dashite> Also, yes the top right logo is good. I think it's meant to be a shoulder patch though.
<Pattyrick> inb4 no, I'm not trying xD

<Dashite> Winnipeg should have gone with something closer to the Avro Arrow design for the jet though. :/
<drfsupercenter> 03APple hasn't made anything actually revolutionary since the mid 80s
<HyperMetalLugia> EW profit maximisation
<drfsupercenter> 03had I been alive back then, I would have been a fan

<HyperMetalLugia> Hey Patty, is the iPad revolutionary?
<drfsupercenter> 03Pattyrick really needs to watch Pirates of Silicon Valley
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice movie
<Pattyrick> iPod was probably one of the first brands of mass-produced MP3 players on the market
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<drfsupercenter> 03it wasn't
<Pattyrick> I think it is
<HyperMetalLugia> What about the Sony walkman?
<Dashite> Montreal needs to go back to this song. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfTpGKJqROY
<Dusky> 06back
<drfsupercenter> 03it was just the first to ADVERTISE
<drfsupercenter> 03There were plenty of them
<drfsupercenter> 03I had mp3 players long before iPods came out
<Bane> Hey guys!
<HyperMetalLugia> WB
<drfsupercenter> 03and they used SD cards
<Pattyrick> it helped restart the tablet boom; I'd never seen anything like it
<Dashite> Hey Bane.
<abronylikeyou> 0this is good
<drfsupercenter> 03that's becuase you don't see anything unless Steve Jobs says so ;P
<Pattyrick> but I never saw people with MP3 players before iPods
<Dashite> It's so much better than the U2 song that replaced it.
<drfsupercenter> 03you obviously didn't see ME then
<Pattyrick> after iPods came, it seemed like a lot of people got MP3 players
<abronylikeyou> 0it is, it's original too.
<Pattyrick> not even iPods, MP3 players just became more popular
<Hawkie> 07You and your zune drf lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not even talking about my Zune
<Pattyrick> LOL Zune
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to have one of those Rio players

<drfsupercenter> 03making people think their products are actually worth buuying
<drfsupercenter> 03when in reality they're overpriced garbage
<Dashite> It's a game.

<NT|Away> I've been doing crappy at Killing Floor lately.
<NewDCD> 9well YT links are pretty much for real preshows
<NewDCD> 9this is more of "I'm playing Killing Floor atm, guess I could stream it as well"
<HyperMetalLugia> But the best part about my iPod Nanos is that they never seem to want to connect to my computers
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<HyperMetalLugia> What is that?
<Dashite> What kind of dice?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a videeo basically saying how Pokémon sucks now
<Destructor236> Interweb dice.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is entirely true
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Dashite> Are we talking standard D6's, maybe some spiky bastard D4's or maybe a weighty pair of D20's?
<Ascendant> bbl
<HyperMetalLugia> I found my CD of Wicked lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<drfsupercenter> 03Darn it Ascendant'
<drfsupercenter> 03but fine cya
<Pattyrick> bye Ascendant
<Destructor236> D-whatnow?
<Ascendant> I'll be back in like 3 hours
<Dashite> The number refers to the number of sides on the die.
<Pattyrick> ok
<Ascendant> maybe even 1 and a half
<drfsupercenter> 03I won't be
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<HyperMetalLugia> Aha
<Destructor236> Oh.

<drfsupercenter> 03who knows XD
<Ascendant> just procrastinate
<drfsupercenter> 03>scheduled time for class

<Dashite> Well, three sided pyramid, but it has a base.
<Ascendant> terrorism
<DesSur> D20 is for real men.

<Destructor236> But in a friendly way.
<Hawkie> 07I personally think that the founder of this site is a peadge.
<Dashite> A single D20. All you need for Paranoia. And sometimes you don't even need that!
<Destructor236> Paranoia?
<Hawkie> 07^v^
<HyperMetalLugia> Is that a good or bad thing?
<Dashite> It's a table top RPG.
<drfsupercenter> 03so Hawkie, how much longer are you guys staying in the UK?
<Ascendant> Actually I think I can't make my train
<Hawkie> 07drfsupercenter

<Hawkie> 07Yes.
<Hawkie> 07Well
<Hawkie> 07I'm really glad to be back
<Destructor236> I am sorry.It's just i never play RPGs.Except Final Fantasy when i'm really bored.
<Hawkie> 07Not because I didn't like Arti or anything, but in light of recent events in Norway
<Dashite> Ah
<Hawkie> 07I'd rather be here than elsewhere.
<drfsupercenter> 03like what o.o
<Hawkie> 07... You ... Ha. The bombing and shooting?

<HyperMetalLugia> Slowsupercenter
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<drfsupercenter> 03something I did hear though
<drfsupercenter> 03was that Norway was like the leading country for alternative fuel
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I was watching a TV special on future car technology
<Hawkie> 07How.. lovely.
<Pattyrick> They've been talking about Amy Winehouse more than that tradgedy D=

<AlCapony> Oh, is this Killing Floor?
<Destructor236> I don't see anything.Oh nevermind.
<Destructor236> We do.
<AlCapony> I think I need to grab my headphones.
<desertman2> nice doom map
<Destructor236> What the hell was the pyro doing there?
<Destructor236> I sure can dig it!
<Espeon> 06:3
<NT|Away> Pyro's a selectable character in the game.
<NT|Away> Or is DCD talking in the stream (I'm not watching).
<NT|Away> ?
<Destructor236> SLOOOOOOOOOOW MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Destructor236> Can ya dig this slow-mo action?
<Destructor236> Is that a Combine?
<Destructor236> I mean one of the players.
<Destructor236> LEEEEEEEEEET'S DO IT!
<AlCapony> YA-TA.
<Destructor236> CAN YA SEE WHERE I'M COMMING FROM YA JIIIIIIIIVE ZOMBIES?!
<NT|Away> I might get on there any play in a half hour if that server you're on isn't full.
<AlCapony> Same here.
<Destructor236> Unlucky me,i don't have either Killing Floor OR Steam.
<AlCapony> You're missing out. Get Steam—Team Fortress 2 just went free recently.
<Destructor236> My CPU was lagging becasue i downloaded Steam a couple of weeks ago.
<Destructor236> *because
<desertman2> Did anyone else get the humble bundle that just came out?
<Destructor236> LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROY JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENKINS!
<AlCapony> Another Humble Bumble just came out recently?
<desertman2> yes
<Destructor236> DY-NO-MITE!DY-NO-MITE!
<Destructor236> TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK!
<Dashite> Doom map?!
<AlCapony> I just got it.
<Luna> http://i.somethingawful.com/u/garbageday/2011/Comedy_Goldmine/fakefacts/Jerry_Cotton_01.jpg

<Destructor236> Big Daddy?
<Destructor236> I saw Big Daddy!
<Destructor236> Carnival?
<AlCapony> More like, CarnEvil.
<Destructor236> Oh.It makes sense.
<Destructor236> OH SHIT IT'S LEATHERFACE!
<Destructor236> Ya think?There's nothing worse than a retarded,chainsaw-wielding cannibal.
<Dashite> What about an incredibly smart chainsaw-weilding cannibal?
<Dashite> BRING IT!
<desertman2> is this wave 9 or 8?
<Dashite> Not sure. I can't read it. :/
<Dashite> 8
<Dashite> Roger roger.
<Destructor236> That's way worse.
<Destructor236> That's a million times worse.
<Destructor236> Eeyup.Definitly wave 8.
<Destructor236> My god.Blood is just being pissed all over the place!
<Destructor236> I threw up blood once.It was like 3 years ago.
<Destructor236> I'm back.
<Dashite> It's pinky!
<drfsupercenter> 03That's totally not India.
<Destructor236> CAN'T YA SEE I'M RELOADIN'?!
<Destructor236> Did i see Issac Clark or am i just trippin like Pinkie?
<Dashite> Can't it be both?
<AlCapony> WHY. WHY. WHY DO I LOOK AT YOU RELOADIN- dead.
<Dashite> OH SHI-
<Destructor236> I better swim in all that blood.
<Luna> Wanted to see how many people would notice :P
<drfsupercenter> 03well I see fakefacts in the URL
<AlCapony> Can it be LODS O EMONE time now?
<Destructor236> Random shit indeed.
<Destructor236> When you threw that cash,it looked like in Minecraft.
<Luna> Yeah, didn't help any
<Dman> the dosh is now DIAMONDS
<Dashite> Minecraft is adding slenderman as new mob in 1.8
<Destructor236> I mean the way you threw that cash.
<Destructor236> You're in my way sir.
<Destructor236> Slenderman said hi BTW.
<Destructor236> Rebrebreb Reb Brown!
<Destructor236> lol red pyro moonwalking.
<Dashite> LOADS OF MONAY!
<Destructor236> It's awesome.
<AlCapony> KA-BOOM.
<Destructor236> KA-BEWM!
<Destructor236> I wonder if there's a ponyville map in this.
<AlCapony> Destructor236: Maybe when kof_ponyville is finished, someone will try to convert the map to KF.
<Destructor236> If there's a Doom map,then why not a Ponyville map?
<Destructor236> That was AWESOME!
<Dashite> Yes
<AlCapony> Amazing.
<Destructor236> Yes.There are some blurry pixels when alot of stuff whas going on,but other than that,perfect.
<HyperMetalLugia> Garbageday made it clear that it was a trap
<Destructor236> *was
<Destructor236> So many british voices.
<NT|Away> I'm sure a Ponyville map will be coming.
<NT|Away> L4D2 Equestria campaign? It could happen.
<Destructor236> cool

<Destructor236> Trololololololol.
<DragonRage> And then that man looked just like the Pyro. This game is weird.
<Destructor236> OH NO!PYRO IS DEAD!

<DragonRage> If I could, I would totally link to it just to make sure. But no links, I think that was a rule.
<Destructor236> That X-Men cartoon is one of my favorite shows.All being cartoons,of course.
<DragonRage> Likewise.
<Destructor236> I don't really like live-action that much.
<Destructor236> Unless it's internet reviews.
<DragonRage> Man, the voice acting in this game is really funny.
<The_Si> Here comes 2!
<Destructor236> I think the voice acting in this is annoying as fuck.
<AlCapony> It's called the Mute button.
<Destructor236> It's just i love making fun of it.
<DragonRage> I can see why it'd be annoying, it's the same reason I find it funny, I think.

<Destructor236> Wow.If this WASN'T almost entirely like L4D,you'd be the survivors fighting the infected.
<Ray> 02:<
<AlCapony> Dman: They said no. So I went on the balloon instead.
<AlCapony> Er.
<AlCapony> Wait.
<AlCapony> I meant the BALL.
<Kosoveon> why D:
<Kosoveon> what did I do
<AlCapony> Speaking of L4D2...
<AlCapony> I should really try those maps that Sathi gave.
<Glacymr> 12hiiii

*Kosoveon also has Brawl now
<Ray> 02And I don't have a wii now
<Ray> 02Irony, lmao
<Kosoveon> yep
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL I love how Cartoon Network showed the live action Transformers
*drfsupercenter cuts commercials
<Kosoveon> when will you be coming back? D:
<Destructor236> Inglip went in that building.He didn't like it.
<Glacymr> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, this new Thundercats series looks dumb
<Destructor236> Was that Slenderman?
<Ray> 02Depends, lawl
<Ray> 02Can be anywhere between from 2 weeks to 2 years
<Ray> 02xD
<Kosoveon> ...why? O_o
<Kosoveon> why are you there
<Destructor236> You should maybe hide in that building.
<SilverSonic> I got my new senior pictures
<Ray> 02Derp. It seeeeeeeeeems that my father will get transfered and blargh
<Dman> AlCapony i haven't even tried them myself yet
<Kosoveon> oh
<Kosoveon> why is your wii unusable in europe?
<AlCapony> Dman: Maybe we could sometime.
<Ray> 02Diferent electricity .-.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ray
<Dman> i'm free now till a few hours btw
<Ray> 02Sooo... Wheeeeee
<HyperMetalLugia> That was no problem
<drfsupercenter> 03then buy a $5 transformers
<drfsupercenter> 03-s
<Destructor236> Close that door.
<drfsupercenter> 03and I don't mean the robots
<HyperMetalLugia> I used my wii in the UK :P
<AlCapony> Dman: Maybe now.
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean the kind you use for traveling
<Dman> get off the floor
<HyperMetalLugia> I think it is the ONLY console that can use a transformer
<Dman> nobody walk the dinosaur
<Destructor236> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<Dman> AlCapony i'm down for that
<Dman> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<AlCapony> :)
<HyperMetalLugia> Power useage
<{Skyedevil}> Awww shit...
<drfsupercenter> 03the Wii has a power brick, not just a plug
<HyperMetalLugia> Think about it :P
<drfsupercenter> 03usually, that brick can use different voltages
<Ray> 02Bermuda uses 220V 60h or 110V 50h?
<HyperMetalLugia> US
<HyperMetalLugia> We run on US xd
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03though
<drfsupercenter> 03can the Wii's power brick do both 120 and 240V?
<drfsupercenter> 03It might be able to
<Ray> 02Nope
<drfsupercenter> 03you sure about that?
<HyperMetalLugia> I dobut it without modding
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ray> 02because the Electricity frecuency screws up
<drfsupercenter> 03you know that box?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's part of the plug?
<drfsupercenter> 03What do you think that does, magic?
<drfsupercenter> 03It converts AC into DC, which is what the console runs on
<drfsupercenter> 03Devices with preset voltages usually don't need that little box
<drfsupercenter> 03the box generally can take different voltages
*Ray points at the Electrity frecuency change 50h to 60h
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03other way around
<drfsupercenter> 0360Hz in America, 50Hz in Europe
<HyperMetalLugia> US is 60
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03and techncailly it's 59.94, not 60
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03but never mind me, I'm just a nerd

<drfsupercenter> 03magic
<HyperMetalLugia> Exactly 30FPS, it's 29.94
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and ~29.97fps is ~59.94/2
<HyperMetalLugia> Or however it can go
<HyperMetalLugia> Blaa
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohwell
<drfsupercenter> 03and then you get film which uses 23.976fps and screws both up :D
<drfsupercenter> 03hence the progressive vs interlaced
<HyperMetalLugia> Now, time for 3DS proxy issues :D
<Ray> 02loool
<drfsupercenter> 031080p is usually 24fps
<Destructor236> Big Daddy got pwned.
<drfsupercenter> 03whereas stuff like 480i or 1080i for lamers, is 30fps
<drfsupercenter> 03usually.
<RDash> Lol, it's always interesting what's streaming when I get here. Are you actually playing?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah um

<drfsupercenter> 03;P
<RDash> 5 seconds!
<Destructor236> Ohai RDash.
<RDash> Hi
<HyperMetalLugia> So we just need to saw off the plug and replace the end with a europe standard?
<Destructor236> You got a break from clearing the sky?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL sawing off
<drfsupercenter> 03nah, just use an adapter
*Ray again points at the Electricity Frecuency
<drfsupercenter> 03heck if you're going to be there long term
<drfsupercenter> 03I could MAIL you an adapter
<drfsupercenter> 03Ray
<HyperMetalLugia> It converts anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03No country in the world uses 240V and 60Hz
<HyperMetalLugia> Hurp
<RDash> Nope, it's been so hot that I had to make it rain over here.
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<drfsupercenter> 03Trust me, it will work
<Destructor236> Oh.
<Ray> 02Mine wii is 60hz .-.
<SilverMane> what are we watching?
<drfsupercenter> 03again, that little box attached to the cord is a transformers
<drfsupercenter> 03...

<Pattyrick> Thank you for your uber-reliable service, Italia Telecom
<drfsupercenter> 03Ray
<desertman2> killing floor right now
<drfsupercenter> 03The Wii runs off direct current, right?
<SilverMane> ah
<HyperMetalLugia> My US wii worked on the UK/PAL TCs
<drfsupercenter> 03Hz only exists for alternating current
<HyperMetalLugia> *TVs
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Ooh
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice
<drfsupercenter> 03the transformer turns it INTO DC
*HyperMetalLugia derp
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Ohai Silvermane
<drfsupercenter> 03yay actually taking an interest in physics in high school?
<Destructor236> Well,it's pretty breasy where i am RDash.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup

<Destructor236> *breazy
<drfsupercenter> 03heck
<drfsupercenter> 03I had this physics class
<SilverMane> hello master havetubawilltravel
<drfsupercenter> 03and my teacher actually asked me to give a talk about cellphone frequencies since I knew more than he did
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like :D
<RDash> Well, better than no breeze at all
<Kosoveon> whenever you get that worked out, ray
<HyperMetalLugia> Y u geeky?
<drfsupercenter> 03because I can be?
<DragonRage> DragonRage wishes it would rain here. And not just because I love rain—this heat is unbearable.
<Kosoveon> I'll be able to play brawl again when I get back from visiting my dad in arizona in a couple weeks :>
<Destructor236> So RDash,how's it goin'?
<RDash> Get somepony to make it rain
<drfsupercenter> 03am I the only one here who lives with both parents?
<SilverMane> welp, i found out why Spark is such a popular fanfic. And i don't think it was Spark itself, but the continuation
<drfsupercenter> 03and whos parents aren't divorced o.o
<Destructor236> Spark?What's that?
<RDash> Good, not much going on but I guess that might be a good thing
<DragonRage> COntinuation?
<HyperMetalLugia> My parents aren't
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Ray> 02^
<Ray> 02o.o
<SilverMane> Spark was an 8-part fanfic, and it has a single continuation chapter after the end of the original storyline
<Destructor236> What kind of fanfic?
<Kosoveon> yeah
<SilverMane> shipping/grimdark
<Kosoveon> that's why I didn't get a birthday present from him
<Ray> 02Soo... anyway this gives me the chance to buy a new console
<Destructor236> What happens in it?
<Kosoveon> the wii is supposed to be my present XD
<drfsupercenter> 03Ray, how many times do I have to prove it to you that your Wii will work just fne :L|

<drfsupercenter> 03I can just take ISOs
<drfsupercenter> 03burn them to a DVD
<drfsupercenter> 03and put it in the console
<drfsupercenter> 03and it plays
<drfsupercenter> 03no homebrew required
<drfsupercenter> 03I obviously have HBC too...
<Destructor236> Well,i DO have a folder full of fanfics.And BTW,it's Past sins.
<HyperMetalLugia> I loved HBC
<drfsupercenter> 03but I have never had any luck with disc loaders, they don't work
<drfsupercenter> 03and the hard drive loader, well, don't feel like using a hard drive LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> ...for playing music and emulators
<HyperMetalLugia> Or DVDs xD
<drfsupercenter> 03WAD Manager or gtfo

<Bjornfot> KILLEN FLAU
<RDash> It's hard to find good ones, some can be really bad
<HyperMetalLugia> Sure!
<Ray> 02500gb Disk Drives Ftw?

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 pay me in Nintendo points and I give you the WiiWare
<RDash> I read Cupcakes 0.0
<Destructor236> Oh,OF COURSE!AN AXE!LIKE IT WASN'T ENOUGH LIKE LEFT 4 DEAD,NOW THEY PUT AN AXE IN THE GAME?WHAT THE HELL MAN?
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<HyperMetalLugia> I have no Wii anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> ;.;
<drfsupercenter> 03EW COMMERCIAL PIRACY, it's completely against my morals
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll give away copies
<drfsupercenter> 03but I won't take money for them
<DragonRage> I also need to get to writing fanfics, too. =/ I actually just finished one today. That I started today. That surprised me.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just... a lot worse, you konw?
<Ray> 02LOL Commercial piracy
<drfsupercenter> 03*know
<Destructor236> I bet you're scared of Pinkie now RDash.
<Ray> 02That's a local sport in Venezuela, lmfao
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03then I'd be a hero down there
<HyperMetalLugia> See, poor country ;<
<HyperMetalLugia> Hah
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd just give the stuff away for free
<RDash> I can't look at her the same anymore
<RDash> lol
<Destructor236> brb,gotta eat mah cheezburgers.
<DragonRage> Around 4,280 words, for the Writers Training Grounds event thing.
<Ray> 02LOLyeah
<drfsupercenter> 03though I must say, having my friends ask me for movies every day gets annoying
<drfsupercenter> 03luckily people don't anymore XD
<Ray> 02However since Piracy is "legal" over there
<HyperMetalLugia> Anyway, who needs WADs when you have ported Emulators and ROMS >:3
<Ray> 02Everyone knows how to pirate |D
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony's own insurers are suing the gaming giant over the PSN hack, claiming they are not liable to pay for any lawsuit claims and damages from future legal actions.
<drfsupercenter> 03Zurich American filled a lawsuit against Sony asking the court to exempt it from paying claims related to any "class-action lawsuits, miscellaneous claims, or potential future actions instituted by any state attorney general."
<drfsupercenter> 03Zurich believes that the general cover policy that Sony has purchased does not cover the expected fallout from the PSN hack, which saw millions of user's data being stolen, as well as a month long outage for PS3 gamers. Zurich claims the policy only covers "bodily injury, property damage or personal and advertising injury", and so would not cover the after effects of the PSN hacking saga.
<drfsupercenter> 03Zurich also revealed that "55 cases have been brought against Sony in the US as a result of the attacks", and has also filled separate lawsuits filled Sony's other insurers, to get them to take up more of the slack.
<HyperMetalLugia> And who needs ROMs when you have the real cart/console
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony estimates that they are set to lose $171 million in costs due to the PSN hacking and outage.
<drfsupercenter> 03This is great news :D
<RDash> The think is that if anypony would do what she did in that fic, it would definitely be her
<RDash> thing*
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay
<HyperMetalLugia> Can we hack Kinect next?
<PizzaPony> Alright, since my SilverMane account is still in use due to the stupid computer failing, this will have to do for now
<drfsupercenter> 03it's already been hacked
<drfsupercenter> 03Microsoft even released a SDK
<HyperMetalLugia> I know XD
<Bjornfot> DCD, the quality of the stream is so bad I want to cry...
<HyperMetalLugia> At least MS does it right
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<HyperMetalLugia> Who needs a xbox when you have a PC
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03they're still evil, but they're the least evil of the 3
<Bjornfot> ...OMG PIZZAPONY
<drfsupercenter> 03Nintendo is pretty evil now too
<HyperMetalLugia> Apple > Sony > Nintendo > MS - In Evil
<HyperMetalLugia> Or something like that
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, wtf is this crap releasing Wii/DSi updates that do absolutely nothing but disable homebrew
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just pathetic
<PizzaPony> yes Bjornfot? Are you... *hungry?*
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Better low quality stream than stream so laggy it's unwatchable, Bjorn.
<HyperMetalLugia> I know :<
<Elky> hi yall
<drfsupercenter> 03and as for the 3DS
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Hi Elky :D
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a thing they force you to accept
<Bjornfot> yeah, I'm hungry for some SHIPPING!
<Ray> 02LOL updating Wii/DSi
<PizzaPony> Elky!
<HyperMetalLugia> Really .v.
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<drfsupercenter> 03that says "We can do whatever we want whenever we want, including bricking the console that you paid for, if we don't like what you do with it"
<HyperMetalLugia> I know
<drfsupercenter> 03and there's nothing anybody can do about it
<HyperMetalLugia> Install homebrew
<drfsupercenter> 03besides what I do and keep the wireless disabled
<Elky> I guess this is still killing floor?
<HyperMetalLugia> That blocks the updats
<HyperMetalLugia> *updates
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03can't spy on me if I don't connect my 3DS online, now, can you? >:P
<drfsupercenter> 03there is no 3DS homebrew yet.
<Bjornfot> I don't think I want to be the guilty person this time, though. Dman still hates me for yesterday...
<Ray> 02<drfsupercenter> 03and there's nothing anybody can do about it ... yet(?) - Fixed
<drfsupercenter> 03well

<Bjornfot> Okay, DCD... tell me why people like CoD - especially MW and forward
<DragonRage> DragonRage feels for you, DCD.
<SilverMane> CoD has a good story usually, and is fun?
<HyperMetalLugia> I still use my DVR/VCR xD
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<Dashite> MW1 was pretty great.
<drfsupercenter> 03I use my computer as a home-made DVR
<Bjornfot> i think he meant my fast chat thingy, silvermane
<HyperMetalLugia> Or did I misread

<NT|Away> That is all.
<Dman> Hey, i liked world at war. my face cod so far and i've played em all
<Bjornfot> but i have actually made some porper fics too
<drfsupercenter> 03most people go "Why record movies off TV when I can just buy/pirate the DVD/Blu-Ray?"
<Elky> story in a shooter? no thanks
<NT|Away> Though I don't play it much at all.
<drfsupercenter> 03I do, because I like TV edits
<SilverMane> you wrote a fanfic bjornfot? on here? how did it go
<drfsupercenter> 03because EW SWEARING
<drfsupercenter> 03it's fun to see what they change words to
<Dman> Bjornfot did about u and me D:
<Destructor236> Yes,do tell!
<RobotPinkie> I really want to get some pony swag, but I have no idea where to get it in Sweden.
<HyperMetalLugia> Did they do a edit of BTTF1?
*Arcanine performs poorly for Kosoveon on purpose

<Dman> http://pastebin.com/CiTRfFSv
<HyperMetalLugia> I think I saw one once
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<Dman> lul
<NT|Away> Shooters can have stories. They should.
*Arcanine watches Kosoveon get 20th place in a contest of 10 people
<NT|Away> Ex: Fallout 3.
<Pattyrick> Shockwave Flash = super ultra mega epic FAIL
<Pattyrick> keeps crashing
<Dman> MW2 is a great game - it's just so OVERrated it's now considered awful : /
<NT|Away> Shooter/RPG, though.
<RobotPinkie> Fallout 3 is like... 90% VATS for me.
<HyperMetalLugia> What browser are you using?
<Dashite> MW2 has no dedicated servers. Fail.
*Pattyrick voted for Giovanni's Persian in this dog contest
<SilverMane> I saw him start hat fic last night, didn't get to see it finish.
<Caimoftheunion> Shooters can have stories, but it depends on the type.
*Kosoveon shrugs
<Pattyrick> Google Chrome
<Dman> Dashite - eks bawx
<HyperMetalLugia> Your PC sucks
<Bjornfot> RobotPinkie: O MY GOSH! HOLY MOLEY! Svensk broder?
<Kosoveon> you'll do better next year
<drfsupercenter> 03<HyperMetalLugia> Did they do a edit of BTTF1? <- Yep.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or flash
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Back to the Future has one of the best edits
<Pattyrick> and I got an error message with a bunch of Chinese writing 0__o
<Caimoftheunion> Having a heavy story would have ruined Bulletstorm.
<NT|Away> The only fail for CoD for me is that it's published by Activision.
<drfsupercenter> 03"Jeez Louise, doc!"
*Arcanine blinks at Kosoveon
<Dashite> Dman: FPS on controller. Also fail. :p
<Dman> Silvermane - I read like 4 posts, but one had you thrusting into - I stopped reading there

<HyperMetalLugia> I saw them all on VHS
<HyperMetalLugia> o yeah
<Dman> ^ im NOT kidding watch any good plays on any fps on consoles
<Caimoftheunion> And Shadows of the damned can get away with a lot of story due to proper pacing, a mostly lack of cutscenes, and the fact that the plot is funny.
*Pattyrick gives Arcanine some eyedrops so the blinking can be fixed
<drfsupercenter> 03is them editing "by terrorists" out of the letter he writes to the Doc
<Dman> you strafe 60% aim and actually aim for like 40%

<Caimoftheunion> A homo accent?
<RobotPinkie> So this is seriously in the MGS universe?

<Ascendant> honestly, as Manlyguy stated in my topic
<SilverMane2> Silverscreen, you poor bastard, he's fucking huge!
<Ascendant> the community isn't very open to new members
<Pegacorn> Why was i kicked?
<DragonRage> Poor Silverscreen -and- Silvermane.
<SilverMane2> basically don't dis on policenauts being streamed
<Bjornfot> because it's ok to not like things

*NightSeas runs
<SilverMane2> sure why not
<Ascendant> Pattyrick, I think the IRC community is honestly more important than the forums

<Quanyails> 7I personally think that we should almost 'feature' people who visit our site and contribute to it. :P
<Ascendant> Because the IRC community is the TST community that constantly visits
<Dman> KICK BJORNFOT
<Bjornfot> he's a huge sea serpent
<Dman> sorry bjornfot
<Pattyrick> We don't want their inbox to be full immediately, GL :P
<SilverMane2> BJORNFOT YOU BASTARD
<SilverMane2> WAIT WHAT
<Quanyails> 7Not exactly 'feature' as something to congratulate, but to be recognized?
<Ascendant> And heh, that'd be the same people every time :p
<RobotPinkie> @pony RobotPinkie will be helplessly stuck under the unexpected weight of

<Dashite> Oh wait, Silverscreen, not silvermane...
<Ascendant> I'm not sure if any of you were here when I first joined
<Bjornfot> ZERO GRAVITY SEX
<Bjornfot> DAYUMMMMMM
<Caimoftheunion> Silvermane2: Kinky...

<HaveTubaWillTravel> That must be awesome until you hit the celing, if there is one.
*Ascendant coughs
<Pegacorn> LOL WHAT?ZERO-GRAVITY SEX?U MAD?
<NightSeas> 12I was here when you came back
<RobotPinkie> in kabuki-cho
<Ascendant> That doesn't count
<Dashite> Zero Gravity Sex. No leverage.
<Ascendant> I meant back in December 2008

<Silverscreen> 11HA! I kicked Steven_Magnet earlier. XD
<Caimoftheunion> Oh, Japan.
<DragonRage> I just noticed.
<Bjornfot> How the ef can you even have zero gravity sex? how can you apply force when floating around?
<DragonRage> Guess I'm 0% kicked. ^_^
<NewDCD> 9I remember this challenge is actually real tough
<Pegacorn> What IS the secret dungeon Silverscreen?
<Arcanine> 12only because you asked for it

<Ascendant> for you people who wants logs of my first visit lol
<SilverMane> it was... interesting Silverscreen. but I've seen kinkier. Why, just last week, i was delivering a pizza to rarity, and she... well
<Glacymr> 12Espeon is just like a feline
<Quanyails> 7I'm actually hesitant to look.

*Quanyails 7hmms.

<Caimoftheunion> When did this turn into Leisure Suit Larry?
<Silverscreen> 11I know I'm bland. That's why I started dating Rarity, you know.
<Dashite> Sadly, a long time ago...
<Quanyails> 7How about an art guide on TST?
<DragonRage> DCD should be glad that Luigi is not in this game. If there's anything that Mario Party has taught me, it's that Luigi wins without doing anything.

*Bjornfot "Oh Steven_Magnet, you are SO FABULOUS!" SilverMane floated around in a zero-gravity room with the sea-serpent. "Ooh yes I knooow!" Came Steven's response.
<Ascendant> I cringe when I see those logs honestly
<Pattyrick> lol
<Dman> silvermane x steven? LOL
<Ascendant> But yeah, I'll make my point now
<SilverMane> ...
<Pegacorn> Last time i went into a dungeon,i was chained to the wall,a chain in the mouth,and who would greet me other than Gilda.Yea.I'm serious.I will NEVER drink 20 glasses of Jack Daniel's ever again.
<Ascendant> As annoying, stupid and retarded as I was
<Quanyails> 7I'm still thinking about TST's stagnancy.
<Dman> Ahm off ta bed. Night everypony
<Dashite> HAX
<Quanyails> 7What if we create something new no site ever has done before? :O
<DragonRage> ciao Dman.
<Ascendant> The community of TST, or at least some people within it, particularly Xeli
<Pegacorn> I see crazy shit when i drink.
<RobotPinkie> Good night Dman
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Sweet drems, Dman

<NightSeas> 12How do you think I was as a noob?
<Ascendant> We're just not as welcoming anymore I guess
<Dman> =]
<Silverscreen> 11@pony Silverscreen Waifu
<Silverscreen> 11oh yeah, I kicked him.
<Ascendant> and Quanyails, as I stated before, I think people are attracted to the site easily enough
<Ascendant> they're just not staying in the community

<Dashite> MFW he's already gone...
<Pegacorn> Night Dman.Don't drink too much or else you'll get greated in a dungeon.
<Silverscreen> 11Hey, Dari, think you could get Steven back in here?
<HyperMetalLugia> I haven't seen any newcomers at all :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Other than Chao
<Pattyrick> and you say it's not the forum?
<Quanyails> 7Hmm..
<Ascendant> they just come and leave
<Espeon> 06Something should be in place that motivates people to stick around for long enough to perhaps network a little bit and find a buddy or two
<Pegacorn> He's back
<Pattyrick> agreed
<Ascendant> that's easy enough for forums
<Ascendant> not for IRC though

<Quanyails> 7But as the problem or the method of solution?
<Quanyails> 7Or both, or neither?
<Ascendant> Both, Quan
<drf-Droid> so what Ascendant is saying is that we all suck.

<Glacymr> 12i don't know how to boost or brake or anything
<Ascendant> I hope all of you've noticed that TST has its own "inner circle"
<drf-Droid> Glacymr, the default controls suck
<Pattyrick> Solution: Something that gets newbies friends and keeps them here, but nothing specifically yet
<drf-Droid> remap them to the arrow keys
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Ascendant> which is bloody damn obvious to newcomers
<Glacymr> 12i know and i can't figure out how to redo them
<RobotPinkie> @pony The prophet (blessings and peace be upon him)

<drf-Droid> OK I got an idea. Pay people to stay
<prince-dari> @youtube lolz
*drf-Droid hides
*SilverMane Normally she would just use her magic to put it away, but she simply loved the feeling of the old parchment beneath her hooves... pretty much the only thing she had contact with these days.
<Pattyrick> :|
<drf-Droid> Glacymr, settings
<Silverscreen> 11We need 12 wonderbolts now.

<Espeon> 06but make people more daring to step outside it and take in the terrain? :P
<Ascendant> But some show it less obviously than others
<Silverscreen> 11awesome.
<Dashite> No one ever suspects the Fluttershy!
<Pegacorn> Spitfire got Rainbow drunk,banged her,then left her and pretty much said:"Hey Rainbow!FUCK YOU!"
<Ascendant> And some even invite others into that inner circle
<drf-Droid> I don't follow circles :P
<Ascendant> That's what I think we're not doing
<drf-Droid> most of my friends don't like my other friends

<Ascendant> and Quanyails, you're not everyone else
*Silverscreen 11wanders through the town of ponyville as dark clouds loom overhead. Oddly enough, the pegasi ponies didn't plan for an overcast, so that alone was strange. Ponyville appeared to be deserted. Not a living being in sight. Silverscreen advanced through the baren place, the soft whisper of wind blowing through his ear as he wonders where all the ponyfolk gone
<RDash> @pony The cereal killer of ponyville
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The cereal killer of ponyville is 13Pinkie 4Pie
<drf-Droid> Quany, that's because you idle all day
*SilverMane She placed the old manuscript in its proper place, hearing a satisfying THUMP as it found the back wall. Nights like this, she almost didn't notice how... Shaking her head, she turned towards the kitchen, brushing her navy hair out of her face.
<RDash> HAHA knew it!
<Ascendant> see, if everyone was like what you consider yourself
<drf-Droid> not to be mean, just saying.

<Silverscreen> 11o.O
<Ascendant> but a lot of people here, particularly when they're involved in a...heated discussion or fast discussion
<DragonRage> Spike is like Twilight Sparkle, but taken up to eleven. So focused on his study of marine biology and mollusks, he completely forsake literally learning anything else.
<Ascendant> just ignore everything else that happens
<DragonRage> Not spike, Snails.
<DragonRage> Argh.
<DragonRage> Brain.
<Ascendant> they don't stop to say "hi" to new users when they join their channel

<Pegacorn> EeNOPE

*SilverMane That's odd, she thought to herself. Who would be here at this time of night? She heads out into the front room, old legs aching slightly.
<Pattyrick> even skill on this PC isn't enough
<Quanyails> 7I'm thinking about an overall loosening of the chat.

<NightSeas> 12WB messages have a forever alone feel to them, and only older members tend to have them
<Ascendant> I'm still against the entire notion of it
<Quanyails> 7Well, as for the WB messages:
<Ascendant> NightSeas stop overusing foreveralone
<Ascendant> it's not funny
<eXAKR> Hmmmm.
<Silverscreen> 11Sapphire Shores + Twilight Sparkle Fanfic. Go!
<Quanyails> 7I've seen them on other IRCs. I do find them isolating.

<RDash> It's really good

<Pattyrick> meh, it's ok
<Pattyrick> but not as good as it used to be

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Big Guns is 57% lovely. (161)
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<Ascendant> I'll probably do it in alice or vb
<Ascendant> therefore windows-only
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<Ascendant> creating a GUI on linux is difficult
<Ascendant> but then that'd be a program
<Glacymr> 12it's a bit limited but yeah
<Quanyails> 7Well, most of the populace runs Windows...
<nickstr> very true
<Ascendant> I'll try make a java app or website-based app
<Ascendant> probably easiest and most compatible
<HyperMetalLugia> That's a good idea
<Pattyrick> also, TST seems to hate Macs
<Pattyrick> so it'll work :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe you can make it IE10 compatible
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<nickstr> I doubt it
<nickstr> because Microsoft does not care about following standards
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, they're trying a bit harder now

<Ascendant> seeing as I'll probably be coding both/running them I'll probabyl PM her

<Quanyails> 7Maybe ask if Rora can draw for that bird idea if it sounds good. XD

<Light_Latias> 12and thanks Valve for no cross-platform >>
<Quanyails> 7Unfortunately.
<Quanyails> 7Well, Portal has one, sorta.
<Glacymr> 12o-O
<Ascendant> Quanyails I'll just copy one of Articuno's pics
<RobotPinkie> 2 parter, turns out it's Silent Ponyville
<Quanyails> 7Portal 2*
<Quanyails> 7Eeeeeeh...
<SilverMane> best quote I've seen today
<SilverMane> Luna pouted back at her sibling. "You're my sister, not my mother!" she snapped back finally. "It's always 'Luna do the washing up' or 'Luna don't throw the world into eternal darkness' with you, isn't it! Well I've had enough! I'm going to find somewhere that ponies will appreciate me, where I don't have to stand in your shadow!"
<Ascendant> delete the colour and keep the outline
<Quanyails> 7Digital art does not work that way. XD
<Quanyails> 7Unless you have the original layers.
<Pattyrick> Portal connections for new members?
<Dashite> :D
<Pattyrick> distracts from point of website, nvm :\
<Light_Latias> 12how so, Q@uan?
<Light_Latias> 12-@
<Quanyails> 7And I'd think you'd customize the features of the bird, like crest, wings, tail, etc.
<NightSeas> 12Again Pattyrick, it has to be Pokemon related
<interior_gummy> allo
<Pattyrick> yup
<Ascendant> yes
<RobotPinkie> 'sup gummy
<Pattyrick> I still like that custom bird feature
<Quanyails> 7I think Valve allowed PC and PS3(?) users to connect?
<Dermathil_Hotel> alright back

<Pattyrick> You could make anything from a Hogia to a Moltrapdartico-oh
<Light_Latias> 12but PS3=/=360
*Light_Latias 12slaps Valve
<Pattyrick> SEE?!? =/= = Not equal to! :P
<Dashite> It's only flash. :/
*Light_Latias 12also slaps Valve for the PC-only DLC last week >_>;
<interior_gummy> i'm still debating whether or not to leave the brony movie night when the "a movie" comes on
<Glacymr> 12i can't figure out how to navigate completely through this forum XD
<Quanyails> 7Yep, Pattyrick. :P
<Light_Latias> 12why put the blog post on the 360 version
<Light_Latias> 12if the content is ONLY FOR STEAM USERS?!
*Light_Latias 12deep-sigh
<NightSeas> 12Steam is free though o-o
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<Quanyails> 7But the game is not. :P
<Light_Latias> 12but
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm not getting steam ever :x
<Ascendant> and Quanyails, the issue with the bird thing is that everything would have to be able to fit perfectly
<RobotPinkie> Wouldn't it depend on the version of OSX?
<Light_Latias> 12you need a laptop/PC that can handle it
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Ascendant> and I'm not even sure if I'm good enough to code it
<Light_Latias> 12and they need to NOT HATE YOU >_____>;;;;;;;;;;;
<Quanyails> 7It's actually quite easy to do that. :P
<Quanyails> 7No?
<Light_Latias> 12which they don't
<Light_Latias> 12@me
<Light_Latias> 12they hate me ;-;
<Ascendant> the bird stuff is easy but the actual coding isn't
<Dermathil_Hotel> robotpinkie: this computer hasn't been connected to internet in like, ever. It is still using the safari browser of 2004.
<Ascendant> easiest would be using VB
<Ascendant> I'll think about it
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Ascendant> You'll need to give me quite some time though
<Quanyails> 7That's fine.
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, I really dunno. Check what version of flash is suggested on the official download site?
<Ascendant> I'm busy and I haven't programmed for months
<RobotPinkie> I know that old versions of OSX get left behind fairly quickly. :(
<Pattyrick> I barely managed to make my own webpage using notepad in 3rd grade
<Pattyrick> I can explain to you how to build a hydraulic launch roller coaster, but not how to fix coding on TST
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Dermathil_Hotel> robotpinkie: I just checked, this is OSX 10.4
<Quanyails> 7NS, how much time will you estimate it take?
<NightSeas> 12bbl, dinner

<abronylikeyou> now
<abronylikeyou> go
*SilverMane is jittery with zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<Polarfire> “Gaah Stupid stupid STUPID!” Silvermane shouted at himself. “WHY did I listen to that pony? I knew things would end up this way!” Silvermane was running hard, hooves thumping at the ground below him. Behind him, he could hear the metallic clank of the guard's armor serving as an ever-present reminder of why he was on the run.
<Polarfire> It was supposed to be easy money, a 'nothing any intelligent unemployed pony couldn't handle' type of job. All he had to do was take this package and deliver it to this guy, and that was 100 bits in his pocket...
<Polarfire> He mentoined something about the owner couldn't be seen delivering it to the new guy... Silvermane knew something was up, sure, but how big could these small town operations be anyway? Apparently... Very big.
<Polarfire> The package contained none other than Princess Celestia's horn ring, a 5,000 year old relic considered beyond priceless by those who even knew of it's existence.
<Polarfire> “Gah!” Silver yelled as a parasprite smacked him in the face. He had to think fast if he was going to get out of this one... By now he would be in the Everfree forest, possibly miles away from civilization. He had to mix up these guards if he was ever going to get away...
<Polarfire> A hard right, then a left into a thicket of trees. That should buy him some time... Then a few circles here, some turns there...
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Polarfire> Silvermane ran on through the night, trees wooshing by at a brisk pace. Something unnatural caught his eye. Wait? Was that a house??
<Polarfire> Silvermane screeched to a halt and turned around. There, carved out of a tree, was a small cottage adorned with masks and trinquets. Silvermane had never seen anything like it. Well... Can't hurt to see if they atleast know a good place to hide. Silvermane walked up and knocked on the door.
<Polarfire> A strange pony with a striped coat opened the door. “Yes?” “Umm yes. How to put this. I have some guards following me for something I didn't do... Do you know a good place I can go hide?” She stared back out at him for a minute.
<Glacymr> 12[23:10:38] * Dragoran tickles Umbreon :3
<Polarfire> “A noble heart is rare, I will help, do not despair. 'Tis the town of Ponyville you seek. Go there, it is 1 mile east.” The strange pony slammed the door.
<Dragoran> o-o
<Polarfire> “Well that was weird.” Silvermane looked up at the night sky... He found the north star, turned right, and started running again. By the time Silver reached the the edge of Ponyville, daylight was just beginning to show over the horizon. “Alright, gotta do this quick.”
<Ascendant> ):
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So...
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Soyuz tickled you?
<Glacymr> 12i thought that was you
<Polarfire> Silvermane found the town's post office, and removed the small brown box. He wrote a short letter of apology describing his position, and the 2 ponies who were involved in the deal, and placed it inside the box along with the ring. He wrote down the address of the royal palace in Canterlot and put it in the drop box.
<Ascendant> That was me lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I only go by Shiny-Ho-Oh and Shiny-Growlithe
<Glacymr> 12how am i supposed to know that
<Polarfire> “Well hopefully they'll understand that.” Silver felt his stomach growl. “Well now time to go get some food...” He looked around the quaint little town of ponyville. He noticed a sign to the left that read “Sugarcube Corner Sweet Shop” Several cakes and deserts lined the inside of the shop, and all pretty cheap at that.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I always come on as Shiny-Growlithe? XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And Shiny-Ho-Oh is my forum name
<Polarfire> “That should be great” Silver thought to himself as he made his way over to the store. It was closed this early in the morning, wouldn't open for another 2 hours atleast. Silver decided to wait and sat down on the front porch of the store.
<Glacymr> 12anyway~~
<Polarfire> He admired the town. It was quaint, small. Very quiet this early, he couldn't see any other ponies around. It was so peaceful he could almost take a nap... Silver heard air moving in the distance. It was getting closer, and louder...
<Polarfire> “What on equestr-” SHWOOOSH!! Silver saw a flash of light that looked like... a rainbow fly by at blinding speed. Before he could even turn his head, it looped up around the store and thudded down on the ground next to him.
<Glacymr> 12i need to think if i should make this tcg forum post
<Glacymr> 12or not
<Polarfire> It was a Pegasus pony. With a rainbow mane and tail of all things. “Hey! I don't think I've ever seen you around town b'fore! And usually nobody's up this early except me on rain days. Name's rainbow!” She held out her hoof. Silvermane was a bit shocked. He hadn't expected this at all.
*Umbreon beats up Dragoran
<Polarfire> “Oh, hey. I'm Silvermane” He shook her hoof, trying unsuccessfully to hide his surprise. He was impressed. She was athletic, and a very talented flier at that. Her eyes, were full of personality and life. Silver felt like he could stare into them forever...
<Ascendant> lrn2/whois
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nnnyerp
<Polarfire> “So what brings you to ponyville, Silvermane?” she asked. “Oh! err.. that's a long story. I'll be staying here for a few days I guess.” “Oh. Are you one of those government ponies?” “Well... I guess you could say that.” He paused for a moment.
<Dragoran> D:
<Glacymr> 12i was being pulled away
<Polarfire> “Well can you tell me? I've got some time to kill. And Sugarcube Corner doesn't open till 8 anyway, if that's what you're waiting for. Hey I know! I could show you around Ponyville since you're going to stay for a few days.” Silvermane thought about it for a moment. She was attractive, definitely full of personality.
<Glacymr> 12i didn't have time to whois
<Polarfire> “Ok sure, I don't have anything better to do.” “Well c'mon! We'll start down by Sweet apple acres I guess.”
<Ascendant> XD
<Polarfire> It only took them about 45 minutes to cover the town. They swapped stories and talked the entire time. Silver decided to go ahead and tell rainbow about the trouble he was in.
<Polarfire> “Hmm well I'm sure things will work out for you here. We're not exactly a famous hideout town anyway. You could even stay at my house if you wanted, my friend twilight could do a cloudwalking spell, since we don't have a hotel in town. I mean, if you wanted to that is...” She looked down and swiped her hoof ground a few times.
<Polarfire> What was that in her voice? Anxiety? Oh well. To early in the morning to know. “That would be great, I've got the money from the job but that's it.” “Well Twilight won't be up for a few hours... Wanna go for a walk by the river? We've still got time.” “Mmm, I guess so.”
<Polarfire> The river was beautiful. Turns out the spring-fed water stayed cool and crystal clear year-round. A mild current swept the water along at a brisk pace. Rainbow stared off into the water. Silver noticed her normally strong eyes soften, and she relaxed visibly.
<Polarfire> “I've always loved the river... It's so beautiful and happy. It reminds me of.. of my parents.” She sighed and looked down. Silver couldn't think of anything to say, so he walked over and nuzzled her neck. “Hey, its ok” “I'm sorry, Silvermane..” She wiped away a tear and regained her composure. She looked back up at him, her personality back at full swing.
<Polarfire> Well anyway, did you just come here to look?” She launched herself off the ground and dived into the water. Silver winced when the cold water splashed out onto him. “Oh. Well I see how it is then!” Silver called.
<Polarfire> He backed up a bit, and took off towards the water. “Geronimo!” Silver yelled as he felt his hooves leave the ground. He hit the water and immediately regretted it. It. Was. COLD.
<Polarfire> They splashed, played games, and chased each other through the water, occasionally getting swept up in the current and having to swim extra hard to get back up river. Silvermane couldn't help but laugh and enjoy himself, despite the trouble he was in.
<Polarfire> Both ponies tired quickly in the water, and it wasn't long before neither of them could swim any longer. Once they were back on the bank, they realized just how cold the water was. The wind picked up a little, making rainbow shiver. She scooted up beside Silvermane in an attempt to keep warm. “Brrrr I wish it would hurry up and get warm out here,” she said.
<Polarfire> Silvermane looked over at her. He fought a turmoil of feelings. Here he was, a wanted pony on the run, and he had just met this awesome pony whom he thought at least.. he was falling in LOVE with. “Naah it can't be true...”
<Polarfire> “What was that?”Rainbow turned and looked up at him, her beautiful eyes felt like they were staring into his soul... Alright that's it. Silvermane leaned in and locked his lips with hers, in a kiss that sent fireworks through his body. Rainbow stifled her surprise, and returned the kiss. Silver put his arm around her neck and pulled her in closer.
<Glacymr> 12yeah laugh it up
<Polarfire> They closed their eyes, and saw sparks. Rainbow brought them both down to the ground, which left her hooves free to wrap around her new lover. They let their tongues touch, sending shivers from the tips of their ears down to their tails. Each touch and little movement brought on new sensations, and renewed each pony's need for the other.
<Polarfire> They broke the kiss and stared into each other's eyes. Silvermane noticed rainbow's eyes had softened again, and he saw a side of this pony that he hadn't noticed before. She was now relaxed, almost shy. He could tell his was the side she normally tried to mask with her outgoing personality.
<Polarfire> Neither pony could understand exactly what just happened... but they liked it.
<Polarfire> Silvermane reached over and nuzzled rainbow's cheek. He kissed her neck softly and listened to her slow, steady breathing. If he placed his ear to her chest, he could hear the steady rhythm her heart. He pulled back and looked into her eyes again. “Silver?” she said softly.
<Polarfire> “hmm?” “You know you can stay longer than a few days if you want.” Silvermane sighed. He looked up at the sky, the sun was still low on the horizon. “I think that can be arranged” She smiled, and let her head rest across his neck.
<Polarfire> “I think the rain will have to wait today.” He sighed and settled down on the bank, the quiet sound of the river behind him slowly lulling both ponies to sleep.
