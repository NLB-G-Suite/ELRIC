<Lordlyhour> True
<MrPoniator> And wouldn't that really apply to all of 'em?
<Lordlyhour> I would've actually though Rainbow dash would see in her other Everything she hated in herself
<Lordlyhour> It really depends on their personalities
<Mason_Trowel> Nah. Rainbow Dash she's the talent and potential more than anything.
<MrPoniator> Well, yeah, RD's nature doesn't make her go for her counterpart
<Lordlyhour> AJ comes from a Big ol' extended family
<Mason_Trowel> *sees
<MrPoniator> Oh well, I'mma readin' this chap now
<Mason_Trowel> And AJ met Applebuck before her alternateuniverse self.
<Mason_Trowel> Plus, she doesn't get the benefit of her opposite having a different name
<Lordlyhour> Rarity is just a romantic at heart
<Lordlyhour> I don't think you could;ve possibly kept her away from herself
<Mason_Trowel> It becomes a lot more creepy on a fundamental level when your opposite gender counterpart still bears the same name
<Lordlyhour> True
<MeteorVenture> the logs you say? http://www.drtoy.com/images/construction/clip_image038.jpg
<Lordlyhour> Though Applejack is afairly gender neutral name
<Mason_Trowel> Rarity KNEW she would fall for herself, and ASSURED her own success because she knows herself that well.
<Mason_Trowel> So, yeah, she was perfect for that.
<Fluttershy> LAWGS
<Lordlyhour> Their parents probably just said, ROIGHT. next one we get.
<Lordlyhour> is gunna be applejack
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<MeteorVenture> what's going on in this thr- oh lawgy!
<Lordlyhour> Twi's Sibling realationship towards herself, i think is brilliant
<Mason_Trowel> Roight? I don't think southern accents work like that... XD
<Lordlyhour> Australia is a sothern counrty
<Lordlyhour> people round her say ROIGHT
<Lordlyhour> occasionally
<Mason_Trowel> When I say southern, I mean Southern USA
<FallSilently> So, ah... can anybody explain the Magneto thing to me?
<Octavia> 13Ponies still be talkin a little. :P
<Lordlyhour> eh
<MeteorVenture> *goes and.. you know.. beats up the master hand without getting hurt cause of his limited moveset*
<Octavia> 13Octavia is off to bed now. G'night ponehs! <3
<Mason_Trowel> It was a "You had to have been there moment" in the Bronyville Marathon.
<Lordlyhour> Theres a link to what the hell it means ion EDaily's front page now
<Mason_Trowel> Check out the EqD main page,.
<Mason_Trowel> There should be a link with the recording.
<Fluttershy> GOOODNAIGHT
<MeteorVenture> goodnight Octavia :D
<Fluttershy> ffffffuuu
<Lordlyhour> I love Twilight/dusks relation with themself
<Owlowiscious> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<Fluttershy> so much
<Efreet> bahahaha
<Fluttershy> insane
<Efreet> My cat has hiccups
<Mason_Trowel> I do too, Lordly
<Lordlyhour> It make SO much sense
<Lordlyhour> everyone she's loved has BEEN a familiaril sort of connection
<Mason_Trowel> I think that meeting somewhere in the middle, at a sibling platonic relationship, is EXACTLY what Twilight would do.
<Lordlyhour> Spikes like a brother to her, ol' Lesty is somewhat like a mother
<Lordlyhour> but more like... your mothers Awesoe best freind
<Lordlyhour> Motherly, but not YOURS.
<Mason_Trowel> Also, I liked that the author touched on how the huge amounts of respect and adoration and love for the mentors really is put into a different perspective when they think of them as the opposite sex.
<Efreet> Why is my cat like.. so evil.
<Lordlyhour> so, nt stifling, but you can always go to them for advice
<Lordlyhour> indeed
<MeteorVenture> from my understanding.. that's normal for an RP
<Lordlyhour> Especially when they're exeedingly attractive
<Lordlyhour> I think their dreams may get a little tainted
<Lordlyhour> ^.^
<Mason_Trowel> I REALLY want a sequel that allows interaction between Solaris and Twilight, and Celestia and Dusk.
<Lordlyhour> Me too
<Mason_Trowel> Cuz I think their interactions would be adorable
<Efreet> I just want to see moar.
<Efreet> Mooooaaaaar
<Lordlyhour> I think if that happens, the adorability will just go throuh the roof
<Efreet> Oh no. It's Magneto.
<Fluttershy> har
<Fluttershy> sometimes not
<Fluttershy> sometimes yes
<Fluttershy> insane rps are good ones
<Lordlyhour> i WILL LIKELY DIE OF dIABEETies
<Donraj> Howdy
<Magneto> I'm in your streams. Trolling your Gala
<FallSilently> Shuddupshuddupshuddup it's still downloading.
<Lordlyhour> DUCK YOU, CAPSLOCK!
<Lordlyhour> DUCK YOU TO SOEWHERE UNPLEASANT!
*BlacklightShining wonders what his filly version's name would be.
<Mason_Trowel> And you just KNOW Trollaris and Trollestia would creep into the interactions, with the monarch totally messing with Twilight and Dusk's heads.
<MeteorVenture> i actually don't usually RP pretty much ever.. could you tell?
<Lordlyhour> ....S8nerk*
*FallSilently covers his ears with Luna_In_Socks' socked hooves to drown out Lordlyhour's shouting.
<Lordlyhour> I wonder what manluna's name'd be?
<Efreet> Artemis
<BlacklightShining> >implying ‘anypony have any ideas on what my filly version's name would be?’
<Efreet> Latest chapter says it.
<Mason_Trowel> It's in the end of Chapter 11
<MeteorVenture> so much unrefinery
<Lordlyhour> I dunno what mine'd be either
<FallSilently> BlacklightWashingDishes
<Efreet> BlacklightShining = WhiteSomethingDimming
<Mason_Trowel> Artemis. And the opposite for NMM is Anarchy Apollo.
<Lordlyhour> then again, I dunno what my colt name would be
<Efreet> nyehehehe
<BlacklightShining> ha ha ha, FallSilently
<Mason_Trowel> Not exactly the best names, but they're okay
<Fluttershy> hehe tis ok
<Lordlyhour> Apollo is a name of asun god
<BlacklightShining> Efreet: you basically /reversed/ my name…
<BlacklightShining> chapter 11 isn't out yet
<Efreet> Yes it is. On FimFiction
<User_6976> ] SO WAT IS UR FAV PONY

<Mason_Trowel> http://www.fimfiction.com/story/755/11/On-a-Cross-and-Arrow/Part-11:-And-Back-Again.
<Magneto> Click Here To Unleash Magneto's Powers!
<Mason_Trowel> Chapter 11
<BlacklightShining> oh boy
<BlacklightShining> I'll have to read it at some point
<BlacklightShining> later
<Mason_Trowel> Already read. That's why we're talking about it. ^_^
*Efreet clicks Magneto, unleashes Pinkie Pie's party instead.
<Efreet> How did that happen.
<BlacklightShining> anywhoof, any other id—OMG I BETTER GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE SPOILERS
*BlacklightShining drops out
<Efreet> you've already been spoiled.
<Mason_Trowel> Nah, we won't spoil it.
*Efreet laughs
<Mason_Trowel> Anymore than we already have, that is
<Magneto> Magneto party with Pinkie Pie?
<Mason_Trowel> XD
<Lordlyhour> 6th closest to being quoted, hella YES!
<BlacklightShining> eh, time to sleep anyway
<Lordlyhour> also, i;'ve cracked the four thasands
<BlacklightShining> 'night everypony
<Efreet> Night
<Magneto> Click Magneto to say Good Night
<Mason_Trowel> Night
<Lordlyhour> is there anyway to mute somepony?
<FallSilently> Who would you like to mute?
<Magneto> I'm just joking around lol
<Lordlyhour> never mind
<Lordlyhour> I le figured it out
<Magneto> If I'm that annoying, I'll stop :3
<MeteorVenture> guess that's a yes D: my shattered dreams! i guess i'm gonna become a piano man and sing yall a song cause i'm the piano man and when you're all in the mood for a melody i'll have you feeling alright
<Lordlyhour> Idle question
<Lordlyhour> Pinkie/berries relationship was awesome
*Synros 8the worst mod comes out of hiding.
<Lordlyhour> just freinds, who can practically tread each other's minds
<BlacklightShining> buck it, this conversation is going on /right now/ and it probably won't happen again
<Silvermane> Synros, is it me?
<Lordlyhour> probably not
<Lordlyhour> sleep is ovverrated anyway
<Mason_Trowel> Also, there better be a sequel cuz the thought of Fluttershy and Butterscotch not getting a proper date (for the others to screw up with their attempts to spy on them) would be heartbreaking.
<Synros> 8wat Silvermane?
<Lordlyhour> indeed
<Silvermane> :D
<Lordlyhour> angel/angelica meet each other
<Synros> 8<---worst mod
<Lordlyhour> ::Bad end::
<MeteorVenture> if no one gets the reference.. it's a reference to the song piano man
<Synros> 8Im trying
<Mason_Trowel> Plus, I want all of the opposites to meet each other and their reverse-siblings
<Efreet> I'd be happy to see The Mane 6 Stallions, going to the Mane 6 Mare's world, and just hanging out, possibly freaking the CMCs out.
<Lordlyhour> Spike and Spines meeting each other would be brilliant
<Synros> 8so you guys enjoy your RP session there?
<Efreet> "OH MY GOSH, TWO RAINBOW DASHES?!"
<DJ_Trix3> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 6d:01h:44m:17s
<Lordlyhour> and Spike's reaction to Elusive
<Lordlyhour> would be awesome
<MeteorVenture> well since i was beating up Fluttershy.. heck no
<Mason_Trowel> I have a feeling they would both tam up to break up Elusive and Rarity, and after failing, start liking each other instead.
<Lordlyhour> "I'm SO CONFLICTED!"
<Mason_Trowel> *
<Mason_Trowel> team
<Synros> 8thats not very nice.
<Fluttershy> blargh
<Lordlyhour> ...
<Synros> 8you ok poor Fluttershy?
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Lordlyhour> Wait, y'know how in a dog and pony show, theres the dream sequence of Macho spike?
*BlacklightShining wonders what would happen if the Bucketeers got stuck in an alternate genderswap universe
<Fluttershy> as long as I have Silvermane to make it all better? Then... yes. :3
<Mason_Trowel> amazon Spines?
<Lordlyhour> indeed
*FallSilently quickly chloroforms BlacklightShining
<Synros> 8I'll be having a talk with your parents MeteorVenture
<Mason_Trowel> *Dragging off Elusive* Time for SnuSnu
<Efreet> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/40803
<Mason_Trowel> XD
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about Dusk_Shine silver_spoon genderbent big_macintosh Celeste (and 21 more)
<Lordlyhour> you win the internet
<BlacklightShining> that might cause interesting events with the Blacklight-Freeze-Blacklight'sopposite-Freeze'sopposite thing
<Lordlyhour> 's Porn section
<MeteorVenture> it wasn't my fault D: Fluttershy attacked me first
<Lordlyhour> Aw yeah.
<Fluttershy> Silvermane will you be the judge of that? >>
<Synros> 8dude, her nose is bleeding, and she was blarghing....
<Lordlyhour> We only got a passing description of Mackenzie, didn;t we?
<Lordlyhour> wondering how they;d deal with each other?
<MeteorVenture> she's just taking lessons from nigel
<Mason_Trowel> The only thing wrong with the pic is that Applebuck is supposed to wear a reversed red ballcap
<Lordlyhour> Probably just get along fine
<FallSilently> This Magneto thing is cracking me up.
<Lordlyhour> I prefer the Pink Bnadanna though
<Lordlyhour> Because y'get the feeling what they wear tend to be heirlooms
<Mason_Trowel> Man, Reverse-Gilda looks like one hell of an angry beast
<BlacklightShining> the thing is, a Blacklight x Blacklight's opposite would never happen (at least not /because/ of Blacklight), because of Freeze
<Fluttershy> actually... blegh...
<Silvermane> huh? what? She's innocent... case dispersed... zzzzz
<FallSilently> She's that scary?
<Mason_Trowel> I agree that the pink bandana is more fitting
<Fluttershy> never mind
<FallSilently> Hellew Octavia.
<Efreet> Efreet x Efreet's Genderswap
<Efreet> wat
*Lordlyhour lets out a very gay sounding squee and Stalluna
<Mason_Trowel> Hi, Octavia.
<Fluttershy> he's tired, I'm tired... so much pomfing...
<Synros> 8hmm not much to do at 4am is there
<Fluttershy> >>
<Lordlyhour> Hi Octy
<Fluttershy> 5:20 am now
<Fluttershy> tired
<Fluttershy> need sleep
<Mason_Trowel> Tell me, Octavia. Do you like mmmmmmOn a Cross and Arrow?
<Fluttershy> regenerate for more pomf
<Synros> 8if only I wasn't on a laptop I'd stream something.
<BlacklightShining> arch, I need a /name/ for this hypothetical filly
<BlacklightShining> argh *
<BlacklightShining> I can't keep saying ‘Blacklight's opposite’, it'll drive me /crazy/
<Fluttershy> night beyeetchs
<Lordlyhour> Dusk looks like an absolute Plothole
<Fluttershy> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAHHHH
<MeteorVenture> i was just shipping me and Fluttershy for science and she karate chopped me
<Octavia> Hello, everypony
<Silvermane> night Fluttershy
<Lordlyhour> Night Shine?
<Lordlyhour> evening glow?
<Octavia> do i? i am not sure yet, i have not had a time to read it
<User_9264> hey anyone a mod here?
<MeteorVenture> you gotta believe me guys
<Silvermane> MeterorVenture, if you wish to ship, submit a permit request to the office
<Lordlyhour> Ebon Glow
<Mason_Trowel> Please do. The author just finished it.
<MeteorVenture> anyway goodneight Fluttershy :D
<Octavia> i am a mod.
<Lordlyhour> soundslike it might work
<Mason_Trowel> Very nice story.
<Synros> 8nitenite
<FallSilently> Nightglow...?
<Efreet> I need an actual pony-name.. FFFFF-
<BlacklightShining> and, Efreet, taking a cue from the OCA names, it wouldn't be WhiteSomethingDimming, because that's BlacklightShining /reversed/
<Octavia> i will give it a read when i have some time
<Lordlyhour> Its very good
<Fluttershy> btw tho I am going to bed not closing chat... I am turning into ghost nao... night!
<BlacklightShining> if Twilight Sparkle – Dusk Shine…
<Lordlyhour> by the story
<MeteorVenture> alrighty
<BlacklightShining> those are synonyms
<FallSilently> Nightglow Radiance... I dunno, I'm just brainspewing.
<Efreet> I know. I just felt like trying to invert your name. But I couldn't think of a different word for light.
<Efreet> .-.
<Mason_Trowel> Blegh, Firefox crashed
<Synros> 8a Flutterghost...oh gawd
<Lordlyhour> It sounds as though Butterscothch's voice is FLutterguy
<Mason_Trowel> I don't think si
<Lordlyhour> and vice versa
<Mason_Trowel> *so
<Octavia> i will give it a read when i have time, right now i have two large projects i need to finish pretty quickly
<Mason_Trowel> Although, I like the "ButterBabe" reference
<MeteorVenture> no hard feelings (turns from shipfic into sadfic)
<Lordlyhour> because Spines makes a remark the Fluttershy's voice is just like Butterbabes
*Efreet runs off to try and make an actual ponyself.
<Mason_Trowel> Ah, well, whenever you have time, of course.
<BlacklightShining> FallSilently: I might keep that
<Lordlyhour> That sounds a little TOO frufru though
<Octavia> i saw they wanted voice actors, which would have been great to try out for
<Lordlyhour> like your parents were trying to make up for something
<Octavia> just.. no time. fuuuu
<Lordlyhour> we know its hideous, so have a pretty name :D
<Mason_Trowel> While I noted that myself, I don't think Butterscotch wouldn't have a voice so clearly unfit for his design.
<Lordlyhour> Hrrm
<BlacklightShining> Darkblaze Gleaming
<Lordlyhour> again, too overthe top
<Mason_Trowel> Ohmygosh...
<BlacklightShining> Blacklight Shining – Darkblaze Gleaming
<Mason_Trowel> I just realized...
<BlacklightShining> yeah?
<Lordlyhour> now it sounds like your parents were NMM cultists
<Lordlyhour> Coltists, lul
<BlacklightShining> XDX
<Octavia> haha
<Mason_Trowel> This means there needs to be an "Evil Enchantress - ButterBabe version"!
<MrPoniator> That ending for On a Cross and Arrow was pretty cute
<MeteorVenture> nah though i don't really like ships much anyway for the record.. combat me bro's
<Lordlyhour> my god
<Synros> 8ic
<Lordlyhour> It MUST BE DONE!
<BlacklightShining> Lordlyhour: wait, was that in response to Darkblaze?
<Mason_Trowel> Except it would be "Evil enchanter
<Lordlyhour> yes, yes it was
<BlacklightShining> …aww
<BlacklightShining> I rather liked it
<BlacklightShining> :(
<Octavia> okay, i must be off again. back in about an hour
<Synros> 8p
<BlacklightShining> cya oc—
<MeteorVenture> well some.. but not most in this fandom lol
<Lordlyhour> he's an evil enchanter who does evil.. dnater?
<BlacklightShining> lol dnater
<Lordlyhour> shuttup
<Mason_Trowel> He's and evil enchanter, and a villainous dancer
<Lordlyhour> He's an evil enchanter, he spouts evil banter.
<Lordlyhour> I can;t think of a word, that fits and rhymes with anter!
<Spose> Wow.
<BlacklightShining> Lordlyhour: can I at least keep the Gleaming part?
<Lordlyhour> Greaming is good
<Spose> Merely A Mare deserves 6 stars and a commendation thing.
<BlacklightShining> :3
<Spose> I want moar.
<Lordlyhour> gleaming
<Mason_Trowel> Merely a Mare?
<BlacklightShining> /yess/
<BlacklightShining> now
<Lordlyhour> you know what I mean
<Spose> I just finished reading it so far.
<Mason_Trowel> What's it about?
<Spose> I love Luna even more now, if thats possible.
<Lordlyhour> He's and evil enchanter, and a villainous dancer, he'll hypnotise you with his magical banter
<Spose> Its technically a shipping fic, but its very light.
<Lordlyhour> Continue song as normal I think
<Spose> Its about Luna making amends with the element.
<Spose> *elements
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, dear. More fanon Luna. I hope these fic authors aren't too let down when she gets more screen time.
<Spose> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-merely-mare.html
<Lordlyhour> Hrrm
<Synros> 8wanna sing a song?
<Lordlyhour> There will be Nerdrage
<Spose> This fanon Luna is fantastic.
<Mason_Trowel> Ah, I recall seeing this
<Mason_Trowel> I skipped past it.
<Mason_Trowel> On account of the shipping
<Spose> I was skeptical and skipped past it a few times.
<Spose> But its REALLY good.
<MeteorVenture> sure depends on the song
<Lordlyhour> Unless the Writers REALLY went out of their way to bend for us (god I hope not) there is going to be a lot of fanon trod on
*Mason_Trowel <----- Doesn't read shipping samesex shipping. Nothing against it, I just prefer het shipping.
<Spose> Reeeead it.
<Lordlyhour> Though I hope if it trods on any of the fun stuff, people'll continue to write it
<MeteorVenture> hmm.. what could i sing?
<BlacklightShining> Darkbeam Gleaming
<MeteorVenture> NYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYAN
<Lordlyhour> Sounds like some sort of spaceship/weapon thing
*Efreet needs to think of a cutiemark.
<Spose> Orbital Friendship Canon?
<Mason_Trowel> Darkwing Ducking?
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<Lordlyhour> WHAT, THE ZORGULONS ATTACK, DARKBEAM, GLEAMING NOW!
<Synros> 8idk yu pick on
<Synros> 8no not that one
<Mason_Trowel> Engage!
<Spose> Seriously though, Mason_Trowel. I see you on here like every day and I will keep bugging you.
<BlacklightShining> I still like Darkblaze Gleaming~
<Spose> :D
<Lordlyhour> and then there were no Zorgulons
<MeteorVenture> sorry for speed purposes i had to take the rythm out.. and sing in monotone
<Spose> I
<Mason_Trowel> ...Well, I AM on here everyday...
<FallSilently> She sounds really evil, though....
<Lordlyhour> Try to cut it by a syllible
<Spose> I'm hungry and tired.
<BlacklightShining> what? why?
<Mason_Trowel> So, I suppose...with that threat in mind I can give it a chance.
<Lordlyhour> or try to reverse the Order
<BlacklightShining> it's the same number of syllables…
<Spose> You won't regret giving it a chance.
*RainbowShy inserts a tube into Spose's mouth that ejects nourishment and sleep.
<Mason_Trowel> Well, spose, get something to eat and then scootaloo off to bed.
<MeteorVenture> hmm.. baby baby baby
<BlacklightShining> black•light•shi•ning
<BlacklightShining> dark•blaze•glea•ming
<Lordlyhour> Blacklight shining, feminize Shining Blacklight
<Lordlyhour> or something
<Spose> How are you people still up? Its 4:30 for me.
<BlacklightShining> Gleaming Darkblaze?
<Spose> You guys must run on friendship and ponies.
<Mason_Trowel> It's 4:30 for me also
<Efreet> 7:31 PM
<RainbowShy> Spose, the magic of different timezones/
<Efreet> And because ponies.
<Mason_Trowel> I've only been awak 12 hours
<BlacklightShining> *thbpbpbpb*
<Lordlyhour> RThat sounds slightly less evil
<Synros> 8do you wanna die?
<Mason_Trowel> I woke up at 4:30 pm
<MeteorVenture> OHHHH right
<Lordlyhour> Get rid of the Darkblaze
<BlacklightShining> …
<Lordlyhour> ITZ EVUL
<Spose> Well, guess I can see why you'd be aw crap forgot about college
<Spose> DAMN YOU PONIES
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Mason_Trowel> XD
<Lordlyhour> No
<BlacklightShining> …oh
<Lordlyhour> BLESS YOU PONIES!!
<MeteorVenture> i'm thinking.. but till i think of something i'm just messing around
<Lordlyhour> because there is no pony hell
<RainbowShy> College, college...
<BlacklightShining> I can kinda see how it might sound a /little/—
*BlacklightShining has been shot
*RainbowShy snaps their fingers
<RainbowShy> That sounds vaguely familiar
<RainbowShy> OH SHIT
<Spose> Goodnight sirs and madams.
<BlacklightShining> 'night Spose
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<Synros> 8lol i know
<Lordlyhour> g'night
<Lordlyhour> oh, too late
<Lordlyhour> eh
<Mason_Trowel> I'm glad I haven't started college yet. Still need to get in touch with the government people to start on my GI Bill college funding.
<Synros> 8hmm ok this idea sucks, what else can we do?
<BlacklightShining> Darkray Gleaming
<BlacklightShining> Blacklight Gleaming
<BlacklightShining> umm…
<Lordlyhour> actually I like that
<Lordlyhour> sort of, I'm lazy
<Lordlyhour> but it works
<Lordlyhour> without sounding evi;
<BlacklightShining> which one?
<FallSilently> Jetblack Radiance? It's not a direct synonym, and neither is Butterscotch.
<Lordlyhour> Blacklight Gleaming
<BlacklightShining> ehh…
<Lordlyhour> ooh, Fall
<PINKIEPIE> FOREEEEEEVER
<Lordlyhour> is good one
<Mason_Trowel> It can also be something that SOUNDS similar.
<BlacklightShining> but the syllables…
<BlacklightShining> okay, Jetblack…
<FallSilently> Radiance just sounds quite feminine, despite the extra syllable.
<BlacklightShining> …but the thing is…
<PINKIEPIE> FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
<Lordlyhour> Dude'
<BlacklightShining> Jetblack seems to different from Blacklight to me
<BlacklightShining> too *
<PINKIEPIE> FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
<Efreet> Dusk Shine doesn't have as many syllables as Twilight Sparkle
<Efreet> :V
<Colgate> had a very disappointing encounted in my dnd session yesterday :/
<Lordlyhour> can you stop with wahtever it is you're doing to get all this stuff
<BlacklightShining> …oh yeah huh
<Lordlyhour> …but the thing is…
<Colgate> encounter*
<Lordlyhour> the stuff around the edges
<Lordlyhour> because it makes what you're saying hard toread
<BlacklightShining> those are ellipses
<Lordlyhour> ah
<BlacklightShining> your client must be misparsing them
<Lordlyhour> well, they don't work on my damn IRC client
<BlacklightShining> switch the encoding to UTF-8
<BlacklightShining> 2^
<BlacklightShining> I'll try to avoid using them
<Lordlyhour> ...how?
<BlacklightShining> for now
*Colgate uses ASCII encoding because I can
<BlacklightShining> I'll just not use them for now, and then we'll figure out how to change your client's encoding later
<BlacklightShining> in the meantime, we have a few minutes to all agree on a name
<Lordlyhour> mmkay

<BlacklightShining> darn it, why there no synonyms for ‘blacklight’?
<MrPoniator> Colloquy, X-Chat and irssi. Depending on the situation
<BlacklightShining> >:(
<MeteorVenture> if the morning sun should free me! it really wouldn't let me go.. i'd still be caught inside your love.. can't rise above.. the chains of your heart
<Lordlyhour> Ultra Violet?
<Efreet> Ultraviolet-
<Efreet> ..
<Efreet> DAMN IT
<Synros> 8idk this one
<Lordlyhour> or whatever sort of Light A Blacklight makes use of?
*Efreet punches
*Mason_Trowel *facehoof*

<Lordlyhour> Yup
<Lordlyhour> Me likey
<Efreet> Duck your shut, Lordlyhour.
<BlacklightShining> me meh-y
<FallSilently> Ultraviolet sounds bad, though.
<Efreet> Duck. Your. Shut.
<FallSilently> Violet by itself, maybe.
<Mason_Trowel> Ultraviolet sounds like that failure of a movie.
<Lordlyhour> ...that makes NO sense
<MeteorVenture> i actually sung that in a tinychat once.. true story
<Lordlyhour> What color are you Blacklight?
<BlacklightShining> black
<BlacklightShining> XD
<Lordlyhour> because it makes no sense to call yourself Violet if you're black
<BlacklightShining> and a really dark purple in some places
<MeteorVenture> not the ending though
<Lordlyhour> Deep purple!
<Lordlyhour> I love that band
<Lordlyhour> e.e
<MeteorVenture> most of that was from memory
<Mason_Trowel> And Violet works based on color rather than light type. Also "Black light" is not possible. A black light gives off violet light.
<BlacklightShining> *dismissive hoofwave* that's not the point
<Synros> 8ah
<Synros> 8hello Steven
<Mason_Trowel> But it IS, Blacklight. You're being a picky picky-pants. :P
<Lordlyhour> Don't Synonimise
<BlacklightShining> …oh
*BlacklightShining quits Dictionary
<Lordlyhour> go or something that is barely related
<Lordlyhour> or not even related at all
<MeteorVenture> i gotta watch that anime again.. i did when i was really young apparently but i don't hardly remember it
<Efreet> Can't think of anything.. But, you should do an Applejack with Blacklight.
<BlacklightShining> ?
<Efreet> Blacklight Something
<Lordlyhour> Nothing saying your parents wouldn't have named you something completely different if you were a girl
<FallSilently> What were the Male 6's names?
<Efreet> Since Applejack is Applejack.
<BlacklightShining> what, BlackJack?
<Efreet> Applejack, Elusive, Duskshine, Butterscotch, Rainbow Blitz and..
<BlacklightShining> are you implying there should be a Blacklight x Applejack?!
<Lordlyhour> hell, nothing saying your parents wouldn';t have named you the exact same thing
<Efreet> Bubble Berry
<BlacklightShining> true
<Efreet> I think
<Mason_Trowel> Is the "Shining" really part of your characters actual name? Cuz I find a present-tense verb to be a bit odd for a name. No offense, of course.
<Lordlyhour> eeyup
<Efreet> And no, I'm not implying that. I'm just saying, Blacklight (Something else)
<FallSilently> Bubble Berry? That's nothing like Pinkie Pie but hits the same core.
<BlacklightShining> [04:43] Efreet: Can't think of anything.. But, you should do an Applejack with Blacklight.
<BlacklightShining> I meant this ^
<Lordlyhour> Four syllibles is a bit odd for a pony name IMO
<Lordlyhour> a bit long
<BlacklightShining> whatevs
<BlacklightShining> it's already in a bunch of account names and stuff
<Lordlyhour> He didn;t even specify WHICH applejack
<Efreet> I know. But what I meant, was how Applejack is still Applejack.
<BlacklightShining> not about to change it over that
<BlacklightShining> oh
<BlacklightShining> that's where Blacklight Gleaming came from
<BlacklightShining> :P
<Lordlyhour> Don;t change it in anything'
<BlacklightShining> Blacklight Shining – Blacklight Shining?
<Synros> 8mhm
<Efreet> Yeah. Blacklight Gleaming - Blacklight Shining.
<Mason_Trowel> Yeah, pretty much. You have a difficult name to convert, but it is also pretty gender-neutral.
<BlacklightShining> Darkness' Radiance
<Mason_Trowel> You don't really need to change it for a filly version
<BlacklightShining> Radiant Darkness
<Lordlyhour> umm what?
<BlacklightShining> (new suggestions)
<Lordlyhour> Again, NMM cultist vibes there
<BlacklightShining> thbpbpbpb
<Lordlyhour> IMO, you should just drop the shining bit for your pony name
<MeteorVenture> but another thing i got to watch.. is the mirai nikki anime whenever it happens
<Lordlyhour> you don't need to change your usernames
<Efreet> need cutiemark idea for a unicorn.
<Efreet> fffff-
<Lordlyhour> just use a shortened version
<BlacklightShining> Blacklight is usually taken, though
<Lordlyhour> eeyup
<Lordlyhour> use the name Blacklight shining to sign up
<Lordlyhour> and then in any time you need to Pony RP
*EspyLacopa locates torrent for Lodoss
<BlacklightShining> and I'm not about to Blacklight8241 or something
<FallSilently> Drop the Pinkamena Diane, in other words. Just for fiction.
<Lordlyhour> Just use Blacklight
<Lordlyhour> Exactly Fall
<Lordlyhour> The man Knows what I'm talking about
<BlacklightShining> so we have Darkblaze Gleaming, Jetblack Radiance, Blacklight Gleaming, Ultraviolet Gleam, Violet Gleam, and Darkness' Radiance
<Mason_Trowel> Sign up as BlacklightShining, but just use the blacklight portion when RPing and such.
<Lordlyhour> succinctly put
<Michael89pl> anypony knows the spell to prevent internet connection losses? :<
<BlacklightShining> dropping the two Violets
<BlacklightShining> Michael89pl: I wish
<Lordlyhour> I do
<Lordlyhour> I hid it on mars
<Lordlyhour> when you finds it, Wow.
<BlacklightShining> that leaves Darkblaze Gleaming, Darkness' Radiance, Jetblack Radiance, and Blacklight Gleaming
<Lordlyhour> Its so obvious
<FallSilently> Phonetically, "Darkness' is very awkward.
<BlacklightShining> (nine minutes)
<Lordlyhour> And you don't have a single pomy who's name is possesive either
<Lordlyhour> !s2
<FallSilently> Maybe changing it to something like "Darkness Radiant."
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 6d:01h:09m:05s
<RobotPinkie> morning everypony
<Lordlyhour> even then
<Mason_Trowel> Also, Darkness is a no-no word in OC-making across almost every fandom in existence
<BlacklightShining> Darkly Radiant?
<Mason_Trowel> It is a word that tends to reek of MarySue-dom
<Lordlyhour> it sounds, I'll say again, like you're an NMM cultist
<BlacklightShining> you say that—everything!
<BlacklightShining> >:)
<BlacklightShining> >:( *
<Lordlyhour> thats because its true
<FallSilently> How about just "Obsidian?"
<Lordlyhour> blacklight shinging, sounding feminine
<Lordlyhour> Obsidian
<Efreet> My name shall be...
<BlacklightShining> Obsidian Radiance
<Mason_Trowel> Obsidian has a nice ring to it.
<Lordlyhour> nyus
<Efreet> Super Awesome Kickass Wonderpony the 10th.
<Mason_Trowel> That's nice
<Lordlyhour> Lordlyhour sees no problems in thos
<BlacklightShining> Blacklight Shining – Obsidian Radiance
<FallSilently> I wouldn't put a seconf word with "Obsidian," it's already four syllables.
<Mason_Trowel> Mason_Trowel seconds
<Mason_Trowel> Um, I meant to second Lordly's comment
<MeteorVenture> make sure you get the dub if you don't know japanese lol
<BlacklightShining> all in favor say aye
<Mason_Trowel> It doesn't really matter all that much.
<Lordlyhour> aye
<BlacklightShining> aye

<BlacklightShining> Obsidian Radiance it is
<Lordlyhour> anyone wanna help me name me?
<Lordlyhour> male, magenta Pegasus with a brown mane and a perpetually worried face
<Lordlyhour> because magenta?
<Mason_Trowel> What's your Cutie Mark, Lordly?
<Lordlyhour> It equals power, baby
<Lordlyhour> A An open book, with a scroll placed like a Bookmark
<Lordlyhour> I'm a NEDASUS!
<Lordlyhour> Nerdasus**
<Mason_Trowel> Hmmm
<TheSonicRainboom> To think of your own cutie mark...
<TheSonicRainboom> I guess i'm a blank flank.
<BlacklightShining> (I also need a nickname…)
<Mason_Trowel> Well, I wouldn't necessarily know, Lordly.
<Mason_Trowel> My own name was thought up for an OC pony that is in no way myself.
<Lordlyhour> Heh
<Lordlyhour> Its funny
<Lordlyhour> you always see aplty named ponies
<Zug> Il y a quelqu'un?
*Mason_Trowel is named for a 56 year-old archeologist professor pony who lives in Canterlot and has an archeologist's Masonry Trowel for a Cutie Mark
<Efreet> I can't think of a cutiemark for myself .-.
<Lordlyhour> why don;t you see many Dirt poo "Meteoricly Successfuls?"
*Efreet for some reason, was reason Mason_Trowel as Mason_Towel, because he's stupid like that.
<MeteorVenture> RobotPinkie: i'm ready i'm ready
<Lordlyhour> poor**
<Lordlyhour> Fuck I hate my spelling
<Mason_Trowel> You aren't the only one, Efreet
<Mason_Trowel> XD
*Mason_Trowel IS dirt poor
<TheSonicRainboom> Let's make our own CMC, Efreet
<FallSilently> Back. Nickname for what?
<Mason_Trowel> Archeology isn't a good paying job in equestria in the story I had planned for him
<Mason_Trowel> Because the world is fully mapped, and has existed in a perpetual stagnancy for thousands of years
<Lordlyhour> Melodic Bree shall be My pegasus!
<`BlacklightShining> okay, 'night everypony
<TheSonicRainboom> Good night
<Mason_Trowel> Good night, blacklight
<Lordlyhour> and he has not a single musical bome is his body!
<Lordlyhour> hah!
*Lordlyhour wins
<Lordlyhour> FATALITY!
<Lordlyhour> bye Blacklight
<MeteorVenture> here have some music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaPhuP4ROUQ

<MrPoniator> Hmm
<MrPoniator> So it seems I'll scrap most of the work I've done in mah ponymation now in favor to switch the characters to be more fitting
<Mason_Trowel> Is your pony a good flier, Lordly? Or does he fly as well as a box of rocks?
<Lordlyhour> hrrm?
<Lordlyhour> Oh, he fly quite well
<TheSonicRainboom> I still haven't forced myself into this What if?- story.
<Lordlyhour> not Rainbow good
<Mason_Trowel> Well, there goes my idea for a name
<Lordlyhour> He does Have Derpeyes though
<Mason_Trowel> Maybe I'll use it for a different original pegasus...
<Lordlyhour> so he crashes occasionally
<Lordlyhour> Suggested name?
<Lordlyhour> Rocky Boxes?
<Lordlyhour> my god
<Lordlyhour> there has to be a Pegasus called Rocky Boxes
<Lordlyhour> and he has to get shipped with pinkie
<Mason_Trowel> The name was gonna be Newton Slaw, a pun on "Newton's Law". Specifically, his law of gravity. Pegasi are known for defying it. Good ol' Newton...not so much.
<Lordlyhour> Newton Slaw
<Lordlyhour> I like that
<Lordlyhour> I really like that
<Iks> newton was a dick
<Lordlyhour> Curse you, me, for being a better flyer than allows for puns!
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<Lunasta> Morning erryone
<Synros> 8well that was rude of robotpinkie
<FallSilently> Hellew
<TheSonicRainboom> Good morning Lunasta
<Lordlyhour> Morning Loonies, Loopie Lunasta!
<Mason_Trowel> You could have the name, you know. Just change up your character to be a completely incapable flier. Gives him a good reason to stay inside with books.
<Mason_Trowel> Morning, Lunasta.
<Lordlyhour> Naw
<Lordlyhour> He's already made himself
<Lordlyhour> If I make a character, I cannot unmake
<Lunasta> Lordly, feeling a little alliterative today?
<MrPoniator> Nothing new for him
<Lordlyhour> otherwise they walk ALL around my head, making dicks of themselves and asking me why Ineed to replace the,
<Lordlyhour> Nah
<MrPoniator> And hmm
<Lordlyhour> Just Paraphrasing Harry Potter
<Lordlyhour> Peeves, specifically, when He was mocking Luna Lovegood
<MrPoniator> Super Filly Adventure makes me wonder if I should code a pony game after I'm done with this ponymation
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm...now I really need to think up a design for Newton
<Lordlyhour> ...I am SUCH a nerd
<MrPoniator> I do know a fair share of coding, so it wouldn't be much of a problem
<Solo> Lordly: Harry potter is relatively mainstream.
*Lunasta le gasps at the latest Nightly Roundup
<Lordlyhour> True
<Lunasta> Meetup in Fullerton?
<MrPoniator> Lunasta, what's so gaspy?
<MrPoniator> Oh, okay
<Lunasta> Close
<Lunasta> really close
<Lordlyhour> You live nearebye, I guess
<Mason_Trowel> I know people are all saying a Nevada meetup that isn't in vegas will happen eventually... but I WANT IT NAOOOOOO!
<MrPoniator> I want a brony meetup in Finland, damnit
<Solo> Mason: Organize it then
<MrPoniator> Well, there are going to be some
<Dermathil> hey everybrony.
<MrPoniator> But they aren't done organizing the one close to me
<Synros> 8morning Dermathil
<Mason_Trowel> I couldn't possibly get the money to do so. Plus, there are zero bronies in my town other than myself.
<Mason_Trowel> I'd have to manually search in Reno.
<Mason_Trowel> I suppose I could email Sethisto requesting he post up an all-call for Northern Nevada bronies on EqD, but I don't know how much response it would get.
<Efreet> soliek
<TheSonicRainboom> MrPoniator there is really gonna be one in Finland?
<MrPoniator> http://ponimiitti.net
<Efreet> So like. I just made a "me" pony.
<Efreet> .-.
<TheSonicRainboom> Ok, that was unexpected..
<Efreet> Can't think of a name. Who wants to see it?
<MrPoniator> Sure
<MrPoniator> Send it over
<Efreet> http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/8760/tawmpony.png
*Efreet chose a spiral cutie mark for no reason. probably because it seemed magically inclined at the time.
<MrPoniator> What's the cutie mark representing?
<Mason_Trowel> He be one chocolatey pony.
<MrPoniator> Ah, ok
<Efreet> Chose brown, since well.. My hair is a -deep- brown.
<TheSonicRainboom> You could just call him Spiral.
<MrPoniator> A symbol like that makes me think he may enjoy researching symbols and runes
<Efreet> Well. I do like researching.
<Efreet> So, yeah. Let's go with that!
<SouthernCross> or hypnosis
<Efreet> A pony who's special talent is reading and researching on ancient symbols/runes.
<MrPoniator> They need one for those
<MrPoniator> WE NEED THOSE EQUESTRIAN LETTERS TRANSLATED ASAP
<TheSonicRainboom> So he is a Unicorn all right...
<Efreet> Yes
<MrPoniator> Sure, the symbolic letters they use in the show are probably just to break the language barrier when taking the show to non-English countries, but still
<SouthernCross> the minute we do you know we're going to start messaging each other in Equestrian right?
<TheSonicRainboom> Everything I think of sounds too cheesy/dumb
<Efreet> Need a name for him. ffff-
<MrPoniator> Probably
<TheSonicRainboom> But Spiral Horn is the one I have the guts to post
<MrPoniator> That may be too horn-ey
<Efreet> hah. Punny.
<SouthernCross> how about calling him Metronome?
<Efreet> Hrm..
<Michael89pl> Bry Fireant
<Fireant> Eloszka.
<MrPoniator> Not sure if it fits with the talent
<TheSonicRainboom> Spiral Rune?
<MrPoniator> That could work
<Efreet> Hrm.
<TheSonicRainboom> I find the names hard to think of since they seem to relate to one's talent while remaining name-like
<Lordlyhour> Back
<Lordlyhour> Not nessesarily
<Lordlyhour> I maintain their more luck than anything
<MrPoniator> Not with all of 'em, but yeah
<Lordlyhour> or Ponies have soothsayers
<Lunasta> Heh, Efreet. Nice try to pass me.
<Lunasta> BUT YOU MISSED!
<Efreet> :c..

*Lunasta stabs his internet
<Zjemwas> Hi there!
<Colgate> pretty much all I get is WoW account phishing
<MrPoniator> But really, why do I have 5k unread emails on my old main email account?
<MrPoniator> Seems like 20 of 'em came today
<Colgate> only problem is... I haven't owned a wow account in over a year, lol
<Lunasta> Hey there Zjemwas
<Lunasta> Spam perhaps MrPoni?
<MeteorVenture> looks like a name
<Synros> 8hey anon
<Colgate> of course it is spam -.-
<Synros> 8oh btw MV your an OP in my eyes.. :3
<MrPoniator> Lunasta, nope
<Lunasta> Well it was either that or a stalker :P
<Mason_Trowel> Does anybody know how to make a link in deviantart not say [link]? I'm putting my OC pony in my scrapbook, but I wanna provide a link to the Pony Creator. I put the link in, but I can't get it to show up as anything other than [link].
<MrPoniator> All of it is actually something worth-a-while, but just that they're more or less automated messages I can check through other sources
<MeteorVenture> lols thanks Synros
<MeteorVenture> so when i try to ban people.. are you unable to see their posts for the remainder of their ban?
<Lunasta> Oh auto-messages. That can explain it.
<MrPoniator> Yeah

<MrPoniator> And some emails from buddies and colleagues
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 6d:00h:28m:33s

<Lordlyhour> til season 2 is 6 days away!
<Lordlyhour> GASP!
<MrPoniator> But most of the time they happen to just say what they sent on IRC or so forth, and I go check if it's a file I gotta grab
<Mason_Trowel> Anybody able to help me out?
<Lordlyhour> and now I've made my running gag for the night
<Lordlyhour> I GO!

<MeteorVenture> ah
<Iks> not really
<Iks> its ponies we are talking about
<Synros> 8have I banned anyone you mean?
<Iks> doesnt get more silly than that
<Lunasta> It's always ponies.
<Efreet> because ponies.
<TheSonicRainboom> It makes me think of all those people with names like Lightbringer and such
<Mason_Trowel> Sounds sorta feminine, though. Arcana has a very female feel,
<RobotPinkie> lol I'm just joking, can't ban yet as halfop, right?

<KShrike> where can I find these treasures
<Lunasta> Make one?
<KShrike> :D
<Lunasta> That or somehow make a topic really derail
<Lunasta> NO SWEETIE BELLE DER-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> 6 days until s2 airs
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> !s2 to be exact
<Efreet> Auburn Runes? sound like a silly ony name?
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> :(
<Efreet> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 6d:00h:11m:52s
<Balloons> !s3
<DerpyBot> I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> LOL
<Efreet> !s4
<Efreet> derpy y u no s4
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> !s1
<Lunasta> lol
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> :(
<Efreet> I broke derpy.
<Efreet> Crap.
*Lunasta hugs Derpy "You so awesome"
<Lunasta> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> !mail DerpyBot muffins
<DerpyBot> Sorry, I only carry mail for identified ponies.
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Lunasta in a tight embrace
<KShrike|Never_Forget_9_11> :(
<Efreet> Auburn Runes sound like a nice male pony name? .-.
<KShrike> :(
<Lunasta> Musky Runes?
<Mason_Trowel> I think so
<Mason_Trowel> Auburn is good for a guy.
<KShrike> I hope we get swamped with male ponies in s2, but since it's in canterlot, it should have plenty of male unicorns.
<Lunasta> Great and now I have Evil Enchantress Flutterguy playing in my head.
<Mason_Trowel> Ooh, I find a quote with me in it in bronydb! ^_^
<Mason_Trowel> My night has been made
<Efreet> Hrm.. Musky or Auburn..
<KShrike> Oh.... how was that bronyville marathon?
<Mason_Trowel> I like Auburn better, personally
<Mason_Trowel> It was nice
<KShrike> I wasn't able to do it, because I was marching a show
<Mason_Trowel> It was mostly recorded
<KShrike> I probably will never have the free time to check that out :(
<KShrike> !mail DerpyBot muffins
<DerpyBot> For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
<KShrike> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps KShrike
<Mason_Trowel> Also, the Magneto thing on the main page? It was a "You had to be there" moment in the marathon. Someone recorded that, too.
<Nopony> Hello?
<KShrike> I guess I'm going to find out.
<Derpieshy> hi
<FallSilently> Welcome back.
<Lunasta> Morning Nopony, Octy
<KShrike> Yo! Octavia!
<Nopony> mourning
<KShrike> We need a Vinyl Scratch.
<Mason_Trowel> Welcome back, Octavia
<Octavia> Hello, everypony.
<Octavia> i am home, finally.
<VinylScratch> :(
<TheSonicRainboom> Super Filly Adventure was just great
<Vinyl_Scratch> there we go!
*Vinyl_Scratch glomps Octavia
*Octavia oofs!
<Octavia> silly filly
<Vinyl_Scratch> I herd u liek music
*^Stargazer stretches and walks in, rubs eyes from just getting up
<Nopony> hurrrsa
<KShrike> :(
<Lyra> :D
<Octavia> why so unhappy?
<KShrike> There is not enough character in vinyl except that she's a DJ
<KShrike> I can't roleplay as her.
<ShadTheCrazed> Place on music and bob head to it
<FallSilently> So add to it.
<ShadTheCrazed> INFINATE FANDOM!
<Octavia> the best thing about background ponies is being able to create a story for them
<Lunasta> Indeed Octy
<Octavia> good morning, DesertRose
<Vinyl_Scratch> Ok, how do I register again?
<Lunasta> This fandom shows us cuteness and also allows us to invent more cuteness for the rest of the ponies
<Vinyl_Scratch> This name is free, and I wants it
<Octavia> ./ns group <main nick> <password>
<Auburn_Runes> .. ;-;..
<Auburn_Runes> Now I'm crying..
<^Stargazer> heh, true dat
<Auburn_Runes> Watching Bones and Vincent just got killed.
<Octavia> Auburn_Runes?
<Octavia> aww i hated that
<Vinyl_Scratch> hmmm
<Vinyl_Scratch> It just returned with "Nick Vinyl_Scratch isn't registered."
<Auburn_Runes> Really freakin' sad, All I have to say..
<Balloons> Yes, that was indeed a sad episode.
<Octavia> Vinyl_Scratch, hang on
<Vinyl_Scratch> Don't I have to put an e-mail?
<Auburn_Runes> ./nickserv Group *MainNick* *password*
<Octavia> no
<Vinyl_Scratch> Ok
<Auburn_Runes> so, /nickserv group KShrike *Yourpassword*
<Vinyl_Scratch> there we go
<Octavia> ./msg nickserv group <main nick> <main nick password>
<^Stargazer> isn't it email, not mainnick?
<KShrike> :D
*KShrike bobs head
<Nashy> Eh, it felt like convenient way to get character out of show, guess the actor wanted to quit?
<FallSilently> Not if you're attaching it to the KShrike name. That saves you from entering the password every time you switch between them.
<KShrike> Which is SO AWESOME!
<^Stargazer> ah
<Dashie_in_socks> nah
<FallSilently> Aw.
<Dashie_in_socks> I'll leave this one to somepony else
*Octavia is out of edemame :(
*^Stargazer drinks down his orange soda
<Auburn_Runes> I have Pinkie_Pie_In_Socks
<DesertRose> I realy should read Hoennshy
<FallSilently> Well, now I know what edemame is.
<Octavia> they are yummy
<Octavia> little sea salt and munchies are served
<^Stargazer> eh?
*^Stargazer tries to debate on what he should do for his first day of vacation
<Mason_Trowel> Ponies
<KShrike> If Hoennshy forces Fluttershy to fight pokemon... I won't be happy
<Mason_Trowel> The answer, Star, is always ponies.
<^Stargazer> Fluttershy just blinks and they all join her team
<^Stargazer> =P
<^Stargazer> well duh lol
<FallSilently> My typical mealtime palette is depressingly homogenous. I really must broaden my culinary horizons.
*Octavia has several things to do today and not enough time to do them
<Lunasta> Stargazer: http://bronydb.com/p.php?qid=82
<Lunasta> Wait crap, did I link that right?
<Octavia> yep
<Lunasta> Aw riiiiight I got this memorized
<Octavia> i need to enable mod_rewrite so the urls are shorter
<Octavia> i keep running out of time
<Lunasta> They're pretty short as it is
<Octavia> i tried to keep them that way
<Nashy> Eating is just a necessary evil anyway.
<Lunasta> just the p.php part that confuses me
<Octavia> http://bronydb.com/82 ..with mod_rewrite itll look like that
<Octavia> right now it just goes NO
<Michael89pl> Octavia: flash lightirc doesn't allow to open links in new tab
<Octavia> also reminds me to fix the 404 error page
<Lunasta> Why not enable it right now mm?
<Octavia> Michael89pl, so use a real client
<Michael89pl> :<
<Octavia> A CHALLENGER APPEARS
*Octavia gets to it
<Lunasta> YChat/XChat 2 is free and it works
<Octavia> weechat too
*Lordlyhour returns
<Lordlyhour> it was a re-run
<Lordlyhour> T.T
<Lunasta> Colloquy also works for OSX, dunno about Windows
<Mason_Trowel> Oh my gosh this quote just mad me nearly suffocate. XD
<Mason_Trowel> http://bronydb.com/p.php?qid=122
<Mason_Trowel> *made
<Lunasta> #122... That's the with Lordly no?
<Lunasta> Wait nvm
<DesertRose> lol
<Lunasta> That's a totally different quote number
<Octavia> i love my quote site
<Octavia> so many funny ponies
<Lunasta> I love it too :D
<Octavia> im about to add more options to it
<ShadTheCrazed> We need to make an animation of Twilight (and maybe the mane six) dancing to this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCUe7UyA_Ec&feature=related
<DesertRose> http://bronydb.com/p.php?qid=22
<Lunasta> I bet a good percentage of the hits are just me trying to see if there are new quotes on
<DesertRose> hahahaaaaaaa
<Mason_Trowel> I love it also.
<Octavia> hah
<Lordlyhour> Nice
<Octavia> i saaid that before i aws a mod, awesome
<Nashy> my head is exploding

<Lordlyhour> I'm central to ONE WHOLE QUOTE on the Brony Quote Database
<Lordlyhour> my life has nevever been more complete
<Octavia> which one
<Nashy> ...so sad
<Lunasta> Hey Octy, I think Lordly over there needs some air, he's hyperventilating
<Lordlyhour> http://bronydb.com/p.php?qid=163
<Lordlyhour> oh no you don't\not again
<Mason_Trowel> I also have a quote that I am a part of, if not necessarily central to. It is one of my proudest achievements so far. ^_^
<Auburn_Runes> I'm in 2 quotes.
<Lordlyhour> if anyone sneds me to the moon, IT WILL BE ME
<Auburn_Runes> I feel special.
<Mason_Trowel> http://bronydb.com/p.php?qid=171
<Lordlyhour> derpy, hhed my commands
<Lordlyhour> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Lordlyhour!
<Octavia> hah
<Lunasta> lol
<Octavia> i am so glad everypony enjoys it
<Auburn_Runes> I like the feeling of being important enough to be in a quote.
<Lordlyhour> Its great
<Leonon> I am not in any quotes
<Lunasta> I love the Derpy: Ant Exterminator
<Mason_Trowel> I'm glad you're glad. It's great for a laugh.
<Octavia> i am about to release another site
<^Stargazer> ?
*^Stargazer is confused
<Octavia> i need serious writers though
<Lordlyhour> ooh
<Lordlyhour> what site?
<Lunasta> What kind of writers?
<Lunasta> And what type of site?
<TheSonicRainboom> Serious writers for..what?
<Lordlyhour> I can be serious if needs be.
<FallSilently> Hmm. I'm in a few quotes now, either as me or as Luna_In_Socks. Most of them I don't think are particularly submission-worthy, but nice to see I've been entertaining.
<Lordlyhour> I can also type a coherent scentance if i'm not trying to keep up with an IRC
<Mason_Trowel> Writers? In what way?
<Leonon> I can write one liners
<TheSonicRainboom> So many questions, so little answers..
*Nashy has written 3 novels
*Dermathil continues to lurk in the shadows.
<mexican> g´morning bronies
<TheSonicRainboom> I've tried writing too, but it was mostly horror/detective stories.
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Lordlyhour> Really Nashy?
<TheSonicRainboom> Hey mexican
<Lordlyhour> Which ones?
<Nashy> Yes.
<Lordlyhour> I wanna read 'em
<Lunasta> Morning mex
<mexican> hi
<mexican> im excited
<Mason_Trowel> Howdy, mex.
<Octavia> well, i do not want to give out its url just yet because it is on my personal server and not ready to be bombed. if you would have interest in writing in a consistent character style then you can send me a /msg and ill pass on the url and overall idea
<Nashy> I have some chapters public on google docs
<Lunasta> Leo, be funny or somehow derail a topic without Sweetie Belle DerAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Nashy> I can give you access to full book if you enjoy it
<mexican> i leave in 4 hours for my robotics competition
<mexican> tomorrow i´ll tell you how it went
<TheSonicRainboom> That's sweet, what did you make?
<DesertRose> wooohoo
*KShrike is listening to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqUzCfXtD_8&list=FLWd_Y1eJNiHPdqhoC0F377A&index=11

<mexican> may be back if have time
<DesertRose> Octavia, it takes a long time for my browser to open a new tab for your quote website when i click on a link from mIRC, might be releated or sumthing
<Lunasta> Remember, remember, the 17th of September for that day S2 shall come our way
<Lunasta> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 5d:23h:40m:58s
<TheSonicRainboom> Hey, it's not even a week anymore!
<Lunasta> Try not using IE :P
<Michael89pl> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<TheSonicRainboom> Sheesh, when I first realized I had like 3 weeks to wait...
<Michael89pl> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Michael89pl
<DesertRose> 6 Days!!!!!!
<DesertRose> minus 20 mins
<^Stargazer> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<DesertRose> gah
<KShrike> Trollneto!!!
<KShrike> I wouldn't have been able to get it because I have adblock
<Auburn_Runes> Foolish X-Ponies, you all have been fooled by this plot created by none other then.. MAGNETO!
<DesertRose> hate it when your hard drive fails. Installing every non windows program, but it ends up taking like 20 computer restarts just to fully update windows
<Octavia> my webserver has 3 large websites on it, bronydb is a bit down on the priority list sadly and once in awhile hangs when it accesses the sql database. this will be fixed soon
<DesertRose> and the drivers....urgh
<Leonon> A pony Magneto would be Magento
*Lunasta has no clue what the hell is up with Magneto
<DesertRose> oh thats cool
<KShrike> ♪With magneto
<DesertRose> When i first saw magnet i first thought of the pokemon
<DesertRose> megneto*
<DesertRose> magneto*
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<Lunasta> Magneton or Magnemite?
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<Auburn_Runes> Magneto, isn't his actual name, It's an alias.
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<KShrike> Magneto
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<KShrike> Tonight at magneto♫
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
<Mason_Trowel> The X-Manes
<FOREVERALONE> Ponies.
*Lunasta shoots at FOREVERALONE
<Auburn_Runes> Hey look. Ponies.
<DesertRose> the unevolved one...
<Lunasta> Magnemite it is Rose
<DesertRose> :|
<AlphaOmega> Rose by any other name
<FallSilently> Damn, I could have kicked someone. My hands were full for five seconds!
<Octavia> well, hes back
<Balloons> Saltythesovietseahobo: Pleas edon'
<Auburn_Runes> Sux2bu
<Octavia> kick him
<Octavia> :)
<Crainy> hi
<Crainy> yeah, kick him
<DesertRose> havnt played or had anything to do with pokemon in 10 years
<Crainy> how dare that hes back
<Balloons> Please don't spam* wow my keyboad failed.
<KShrike> Been dreaming I've been waiting, to fly with those great ponies, the wonderbolts their daring tricks, spinning round and having kicks. Perform for crowds of thousands. We'll fight MAGNETO'S minions, the wonderbolts will see me right here at Magneto
<KShrike> LOLOLOLOLOL
<Lunasta> Y U NO POKEMANZ ROSE!?
<KShrike> THis is absolutely hilarious!!!!!
<KShrike> So worth it!
<Crainy> so.... whats all this magneto stuff about?
<KShrike> so worth downloading it
<DesertRose> just......nintendo
<FallSilently> KShrike: I know, I watched it an hour ago :)
<Auburn_Runes> Your keyboard is dead, Balloons.
<FreezeFrame> Any stream trolling lately?
<KShrike> The lyrics to At the Gala being changed to Magneto
<KShrike> :P
<FallSilently> Crainy, check out the main blog page about the mareathon and download the Magneto thing.
<Lunasta> I may be biased because I'm Asian, but Nintendo is awesome
<Mason_Trowel> It was a "You had to be there" moment in the Bronyville marathon. check the EqD main page for links and details.
<Crainy> hi fall
<DesertRose> I played pokemon blue, and pokemon gold. and then realised every game after that is going to be the same
<Crainy> what is so special about it?
<Octavia> i am so cold -.-
<ShadTheCrazed> I need someone to battle me in the Polka-manz B/W
<FallSilently> The last episode of the mareathon was spammed by Magneto Google ads.
<KShrike> And then Phoe said "Gayest straight boyfriend ever"
<Auburn_Runes> I'm Australian. *punches Lunasta and bullies him*
<Crainy> lawl
*Mason_Trowel places a blanket over Octavia
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Aww.
<Mason_Trowel> I know it's not real, but it's the thought that counts, right?\
<Saltythesovietseahobo> I'm confused.
*DesertRose gives Octavia socks
*Lunasta grabs his shotgun and shoots Auburn_Runes "And I'm armed!"
<DesertRose> W U SO VOILENT?
*Lunasta reloads with candy cane flechettes
*KShrike activates his power suit and shoots Lunasta with a charged Plasma Beam shot
<Saltythesovietseahobo> WHY CANT WE JUST BE A HAPPY FAMILY?
*KShrike then morph ball rolls away
<Saltythesovietseahobo> *group hug*
<Octavia> seriously
<Lunasta> Eeep! Plasma!
*Octavia has angry birds socks on
*Lunasta ducks into his WMD proof barrel and returns fire
<DesertRose> :D
*FallSilently has angry birds on socks
*Michael89pl hates shotguns, he's usually using FAMAS G2 assault rifle
<RobotPinkie> Trolling?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> I'd prefer the m16
<ShadTheCrazed> I need to slap RBD's cutie mark on my jackets.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> *FIRES RANDOMLY*
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Shad.
<ShadTheCrazed> Good show!
<ShadTheCrazed> wat
<Saltythesovietseahobo> That. is the single. best idea. ever.
<Lunasta> So ponies, I have a morality question for you.
<Lordlyhour> Lordlyhour dances on the head of a pin
<FallSilently> Morality question GO
<Lordlyhour> Lordlyhour said that, rather than did that
<DesertRose> Octavia im going to somehow find out where you live then send you Octavia themed socks.....hundreds of them
<Mason_Trowel> I follow the path of "Blue and Orange Morality"
<RobotPinkie> Don't think there's anything on the stream right now
<Lordlyhour> Lordlyhour is now going to speak in Third person. Becauselordlyhour is awesome enough to pull it off
<Mason_Trowel> Oh god...
<Octavia> want my address?
<Mason_Trowel> I just thought of another punny pony. XD
<Octavia> :)
<DesertRose> oh no....because then id actualy have to send you socks
<KShrike> :(
<Lunasta> My school is selling us MacBooks for the 4 years we're in HS but it's loaded full of crap that is half installed and filters up the wazoo
*Lordlyhour flips down sunglasses, while a guitar wails in the background. Because Lordlyhour just stoll all of its money. and its sunglasses
<Mason_Trowel> A pony with a blue coat, a crazy orange mane, and a manic smile, named Morality. XD
<Octavia> why are you teasing a poor girl?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Ha.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> I'm on a school laptop right now.
<Lunasta> I've managed to clean most of the stuff up, and as such my exploits have gone noticed by a few friends
<DesertRose> because its fun
<DesertRose> :D
<KShrike> I got to say, Magneto made the stream (puts sunglasses on) 20% cooler!!! http://yeahbutton.com/
<DesertRose> but then i had a sad :(
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<AllisZero> Morning everypony
<Lunasta> Now these guys and a couple other of their frends want me to remove the junk to make the MBs much much more useful
<Octavia> oh dropbox, why will you not sync
<Lordlyhour> If only there were five members in Friezas family
<DesertRose> Because ponies
<Iks> remove the junk!
<^Stargazer> you forgot the YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHH bit Kstrike lol
<RobotPinkie> morning, AllisZero
<Lordlyhour> Because then it would have been 20% coola
<KShrike> Soarin buying the applepie!!!
<Iks> your school probably has spyware on there too
<Lunasta> I plan to capitalize on this, but if I do I have a decision to make
<Auburn_Runes> This episode of bones is so sad ;-;.
<Iks> like when they filmed the kids undressing in their room at home
<Turgle> hey AllisZero
<FallSilently> Capitalize? You mean charge for it?
<Lunasta> Do I risk getting notorious and possibly lose my MB classes but make money?
<KShrike> Seriously, they should install adblock
<Iks> the system is evil and fighting it is the morally right choice
<FallSilently> I wouldn't try to make money off it. The school would be SERIOUSLY pissed.
<Lunasta> I'll be charging them prolly 25 bucks for each unlock
<Lunasta> Yeah, but I unlocked mine last year too
<KShrike> Stargazer: the yeah button was linked for that
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Definitely. EVERYONE would be pissed.
<Lunasta> They dun seem to notice
<KShrike> OCTAVIA!
<Leonon> set them on fire, make them pay for you to put them out
<KShrike> oh wait, I just pinged the mod...
<Octavia> yes?
<FallSilently> They'll be mad anyway when they find out (and find out, they shall) but if they see you've made money off it, it'll realy hit the fan.
<KShrike> sorry, I see Octavia in the show
<Saltythesovietseahobo> I'm on a school laptop right now, but they never put a crapload of useless stuff on them.
<poni_> I've honestly never seen this chat this empty
<Octavia> oh
<KShrike> didn't mean to ping you
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Atleast, that's what I think.
<mexican> just passing by, have i missed something good?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> *looks left to right suspicously*
<AllisZero> Eh, it's sunday morning
<AllisZero> It's not abnormal
*FallSilently snickers at the perils of having a real pony name....
<Lunasta> Well I don't plan to do all 400 or so MBs, prolly less than 20
<Mason_Trowel> I need to get a picture of the image of Cooler in the sun (from one of the DBZ movies) and give it the caption "This star is now 20% Cooler"
<KShrike> :(
<Saltythesovietseahobo> LOL
<Auburn_Runes> ...
<Auburn_Runes> Bahahahaha
<Auburn_Runes> I lol'd.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> I remember that bit, Mason.
<FallSilently> The amount of money you make won't matter. Not to a school committee mindset.
<poni_> Yeah, true. I guess I'll hang here for a while then.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Umm...
<RobotPinkie> pretty much, what with all the American bronies... should be a lot more people in a couple of hours
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Google Images?
<KShrike> Saltythesovietseahobo: Google images is tainted
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Oh.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> right.
<RobotPinkie> also hai poni_
<Saltythesovietseahobo> all the filthy, filthy.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> ...
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Well, I'ma stop right there.
<poni_> hai RobotPinkie c:
<Lunasta> Besides, the tech guy is half baked most of the time and can barely remove his WiFi SSID and password from them
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Lol ^^
<RobotPinkie> I need to run to the store quickly, I'll be back in 10-15 minutes
<Lunasta> I can even pull it up right now...
<KShrike> Everything bad in episode 26 was magneto's fault. QUICK! SOMEPONY WRITE A FIC ON THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<poni_> ohokay. see you.
<Mason_Trowel> It's probably already in progress.
<AllisZero> Stay safe RP!
<KShrike> Magneto ends up in equestria, turns into a unicorn, and causes havoc
<FallSilently> Ponibooru has certainly been filled with Magneto.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> I'M ON IT
<KShrike> I will 6 star it
<Saltythesovietseahobo> *quick types fan-fic about Magneto*
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Done, and done.
<MrPoniator> Dat Magneto
<AllisZero> Haha my mom just came by and I had Winter Wrap-up playing pretty loud
<Octavia> my new wardrive technique is a python script that finds open access points, finds their printers, and prints a rbd salute picture with "your printer is now 20% cooler" on it
<AllisZero> She stopped, gave me a weird look and left.
<Mason_Trowel> http://bronydb.com/p.php?qid=92 <---- Octavia, you a dirty filly. XD
<Lunasta> SSID: SHouse Password: #D1meC001@Clu8!#
<Saltythesovietseahobo> AAAAAAAAAAAW YEAH!
<AllisZero> Funny is I've been listening to weird shit for 10 years and nobody rarely notices anymore.
<Lunasta> He seriously left it in there.
<Octavia> hah when did i say that
<DesertRose> that would be awesome
<Saltythesovietseahobo> WHAT, MASON?
<Mason_Trowel> I have no idea
<MrPoniator> Lunasta, whut?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> :|
<KShrike> Phoe saying shut up while the guys are singing along with the pony pokey is making me laugh
<FallSilently> I really can see a Magneto pony leading a group of other disgruntled unicorns (Equus Superious) to exterminate the other races.
<Mason_Trowel> Cuz it's a Bucket quote, and I'm never in there.
<Lunasta> My school's tech guy left his router's SSID and password on our Macbooks

<Lordlyhour> I INSPIRED quote 138
<Thorinair> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1739027/MLP/pinkielol.png
<Lordlyhour> But my bit isn't quoted
<Lordlyhour> T.T
<Nashy> But unicorns aren't oppressed, nopony's trying to "cure" them or anything.
<poni_> Pretty much everypony I know knows that I'm weird like that, so then they just ignore me until I stop.
<KShrike> Thorinair: creepy
<KShrike> Nashy: maybe in a future they do...
<Thorinair> lol :D
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Definitely.
<Mason_Trowel> Nashy, it's not the unicorns. It's the Jewish unicorns that are oppressed.
<Lunasta> That's how incompetent my HS is.
<Lordlyhour> Mutant unicorns?
<Lordlyhour> ...
*KShrike get's knife out.\
<KShrike> Let's see what color his blood really is...
<Nashy> in an alternate universe?
<Lordlyhour> If only this were EaD
<Mason_Trowel> After all, Neighdolf Hitler was a terrible pony.
<Nashy> Unicorns are hated and feared for their magic!
<KShrike> Mason_Trowel: :(
<KShrike> puns
<Mason_Trowel> Sorry
<Lordlyhour> Neighdolf Hitler was Horsetrian though
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Waiting for my fan-fic to recieve feedback.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> *rageface*
<Lordlyhour> not Germane
<Mason_Trowel> I couldn't resist the pun.
<KShrike> haha
<KShrike> I laughed, but it was so bad
*Mason_Trowel is ashamed of his poor taste in jokes.
<Lunasta> Neighdolf Hitler? You mean the Juiceish Neighdolf Hooftler?
<MrPoniator> It appears I'm in four quotes, but only have a real part in three
<Auburn_Runes> ..
<Auburn_Runes> hnngh

<Lunasta> He changed it when he entered Germaney
<Mason_Trowel> I'm SO sorry, everpony...
<Saltythesovietseahobo> THIS CHAT NOW BELONGS TO PUNS.
<Lunasta> He felt that the name was too... weak for him

<Lordlyhour> Wonderful
*FallSilently goes quiet when his finger is hovering over the modvoice button. everypony should know this by now.
<Lordlyhour> Doubly wonderful is I just used a Bit of Body Language I picked up from my dog
*FallSilently supposes it's more obvious when Luna_In_Socks goes quiet.

<Turgle> :|
<MeteorVenture> idk allis.. you could try and see how it turns out later.. might get something interesting
*FallSilently realises he's just used the term "everypony" in regular speech.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> mexican, are you actually mexican?
<FallSilently> Awww GOD!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lol^
<KShrike> Wow.... that was the best commentary of Episode 26 I have ever seen. MAGNETO FOR THE FREAKING WIN!!!!!
<mexican> yes
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Hmm
<Nashy> It's too late for you now D:!

<KShrike> The only one who has been able to successfully troll ponies is Magneto
<Mason_Trowel> Lol. KShrike, Inorite?
<mexican> i dont have a sombrero
<KShrike> I can't believe that
<Saltythesovietseahobo> If your name was mexican, and you where actually british, it'd been like "LULWUTWTFZOMGLOL"
<Lordlyhour> that has to be added to the Quote Database
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> seriously can someone explain to me the dead with magneto. i'm a little behind
<MeteorVenture> btw AllisZero i listen to lots of weird stuff:D send something here!
<Lordlyhour> No
<Lordlyhour> No we cannot
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> ok then
<Lordlyhour> It is an inexplicable force of nature known as a meme
<MrPoniator> Just download the video clip from the mareathon wrap-up post

<Nashy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KEDNIX-Syc is what I think of when I think of Mexicans now D:
<MrPoniator> It should be the first link on it, me thinks
<AllisZero> It's painful to stare at the screen for too long cause of the headache :(
<Lordlyhour> They have existed since main fisrt learned to think and will be with us until the last of us Die
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> ty :D
<AllisZero> Eh I've been listening mostly to jpop and anime songs most of my life

<Mason_Trowel> Say hello to FillyShy while you're in the emo corner!
<AllisZero> http://images.4chan.org/g/src/1315735626588.png

<Turgle> oh my god
<Turgle> MeteorVenture, what did you do to me
<EspyLacopa> I don't recognize the paw above Fluttershy nor the compass above Applejack
<MeteorVenture> lol i'm listening to it again too o_o
<AllisZero> That's a weird song
<MeteorVenture> the compass is safari i think
<Turgle> weird, right
<EspyLacopa> I'm assuming Rarity's logo is Opera.
<MeteorVenture> ya
<AllisZero> IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and...
<RobotPinkie> ohay ponies
<MeteorVenture> which i've actually downloaded all of those at one point.. except fluttershy's
<Lordlyhour> Does anybody here know what I am?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, no idea what Fluttershy's browser is supposed to be...
<^Stargazer> Gen 3 pony
<^Stargazer> =3
<AllisZero> It's proving hard to find on Wikipedia
<MeteorVenture> lol i looked up browser green paw
<AllisZero> I've looked at all the web browsers in the last 10 years lol
<Lordlyhour> No? Alright then, I'll tell ya! OOOOOOOH, I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay. I sleep all night and I work all day.
<Turgle> is it Maxthon?
<Nashy> silly
<MeteorVenture> and then browser green paw symbol... then just browser green symbol.. nothing ever
<Nashy> You're on IRC.
<Nashy> That's not sleeping or working.
<AlphaOmega> are you...... A person with a computational device of some sort that has typed "Does anybody here know what I am?"?
<Turgle> nope, it is not Maxthon
<Turgle> :I
<Lordlyhour> How do you know?
<Turgle> OH the suspance
<^Stargazer> the riddler
<Lordlyhour> I could be typing this while felling a Might tree
<Lordlyhour> or in my sleep
<MeteorVenture> i'm going to guess its name based on the symbol
<Lordlyhour> that'd certainly explain the spelling errors
<Lordlyhour> in either case
<AllisZero> Greenbrowser made sense
<AllisZero> But it's not it
<Turgle> furry browser 2011
<Lordlyhour> Maybe I'm doing all three at once
<AllisZero> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_%28web_browser%29
<AllisZero> Midori
<AllisZero> Makes sense lul
<Mason_Trowel> http://bronydb.com/p.php?qid=63 <---- Once again, Octavia. You are a dirty little filly. XD
<Rainbow_Dash> Alliszero, that image gives me a leeching message on 4chan
<Mason_Trowel> These quotes are making my night AWESOME!
<Turgle> who uses midori?
<Octavia> what did i do now
<Nashy> Are you a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shooting stars coming out of your eyes?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> O.K. MASON...
<EspyLacopa> Ah, japanese broswer
<^Stargazer> ...
<Octavia> oh ahha
<Saltythesovietseahobo> :|
<Lordlyhour> I'm Probably Paul Bunyan's reincarnation
<Turgle> ah
<Turgle> right
<Octavia> that is so unfair
<Lordlyhour> heck, MKaybe I'm just Paul Bunyan.
<Nashy> Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic sparkly eggs?
<FourCartridge> Hello everypony.
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Octavia, how could you?
<Octavia> that was totally taken out of context lol
<Lordlyhour> You guys couldn't prove I'm not
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<MeteorVenture> of course D:
<Mason_Trowel> Out of context or no, still COMPLETELY hilarious. XD
<MeteorVenture> how could i be so blind?
<Octavia> i am completely glad i can laugh at myself else that would have made me mad
<Saltythesovietseahobo> I thought this chat was supposed to be PG D:
<AllisZero> http://images.4chan.org/g/src/1315736337002.png
<AlphaOmega> <@Octavia> that was totaly taken in context lol (edited for corrections)
<MeteorVenture> my initial thoughts were green paw which would be a play on green thumb sorta
<Leonon> LordlyHour, I need to clean up some trees later, you want to help?
<Octavia> haha AlphaOmega
<AllisZero> I lold IRL
<Octavia> !mewn AlphaOmega !!
<Lordlyhour> I would
<AllisZero> Yeah, I googled green leaf, green paw etc
<Lordlyhour> but you spelled my name wrong
<Mason_Trowel> I am also glad you can laugh at yourself. Else I probably would have been the target of some serious ire.
<Lordlyhour> SO you just lost all rights to Paul Bunyan
*AlphaOmega bats his big eyes
<Leonon> better than the first spelling I did of it, I almost said "LordHourly"
<FallSilently> I can laugh at ANYONE.
*DerpyBot scratches her head, wondering what Octavia is trying to tell her
<MeteorVenture> ya me too
<Lordlyhour> Lord Hourly..
<Lordlyhour> Thats a cool name
<MeteorVenture> never hit greenbrowser though
*Octavia eyes DerpyBot!
<RobotPinkie> all 4chan images linked give me the leech image
<Octavia> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
*Octavia pounces!
<Lordlyhour> Maybe my Pony name could be Charges Hourly
<MeteorVenture> i always had browser typed in though
<Mason_Trowel> It makes it better if you make it......Time Lord Hourly!
<Lordlyhour> and I'm a Lord
<Turgle> after eight icecream
<Turgle> <3
<Mason_Trowel> More shameless puns and plays on words.
<Lordlyhour> My god thats IT!
<Lordlyhour> I AM A TIMELORD!
<MeteorVenture> copy link address then paste in a tab until it works
<AllisZero> Wow, really?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> PUNS?
<AllisZero> That's silly
*Lordlyhour gets in his Tardis
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Nooooooooo!
<Mason_Trowel> *TARDIS
<AllisZero> So you can't link images that usually don't last more than a day or two to the outside
<Mason_Trowel> It's an acronym
*Lordlyhour goes back in time, stopping the puns
<AllisZero> That seems dumb
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Tardis... why does it sound so delicious?
<Lordlyhour> yes
*^Stargazer thinks the chat is getting a little strange lol
<Lordlyhour> but I named mine Tardis!
<Lordlyhour> HAH!
*FallSilently covers his ears with DerpyBot's hooves to block out everybody's shouting.
<Lordlyhour> Its Tardis the TARDIS!
<MeteorVenture> with my easy 2 step solution you can see.. these images
<Saltythesovietseahobo> TARDIS?
<MeteorVenture> but ya same for me
<RobotPinkie> I just copy and paste the URL
<Lordlyhour> TAAAAAAAAARDIS!
<Nashy> With a TARDIS, you will never be... tardy?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!
*FallSilently stands on DerpyBot, glowering
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Glowering?
<Lordlyhour> Steve!
<Lordlyhour> MOUSTACHE!
<Nashy> Ba-dum dssh.
<RobotPinkie> weird that the thumbnails work, though
<Saltythesovietseahobo> MOUSTACHE!
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Saltythesovietseahobo's shouting
<ShadTheCrazed> Tardis? Did you just say... Tardis?
<MeteorVenture> it changes that to the leech picture so i gotta copy the link address instead of clicking on it and doing it that way
<Saltythesovietseahobo> Tardis?
<Saltythesovietseahobo> TARDIS!
*DerpyBot stands behind Saltythesovietseahobo, glowering
<Mason_Trowel> FallSilently, I'm afraid you may have to speak up. Lol
<Lordlyhour> I didn;t say sidrat
<ShadTheCrazed> Tardis?! TARDIS?! TAAAAAAAAAAAARDIS! TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARDIS!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> the more you know... "gloweringpresent participle of glow·erVerb: Have an angry or sullen look on one's face; scowl."
*FallSilently is trying to hold on to DerpyBot, damn it
<Lordlyhour> Nashy won a single internet for his pun
<Nashy> :G
<Mason_Trowel> And knowing is half the battle!
<Lordlyhour> but only if you have a reading rainbow
<Nashy> 1 Internet, what shall I spend it on...?
<Nashy> Ponies!
<MeteorVenture> i downloaded this thing a guitar hero player made called basic browser
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> cookies!
<MeteorVenture> lols.. it really is basic
<AlphaOmega> the other half involves violence brutality death carnage and weeping in loss
<Mason_Trowel> Ponies MADE OF cookies!
<Lordlyhour> My god
<Lordlyhour> MY GOD!
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Lordlyhour's shouting
<Crainy> no
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> or cutie mark cupcakes, damn they are awesome
<Crainy> cookies are made of ponies
<Mason_Trowel> No, those are...
<RobotPinkie> links-graphic is best browser
<Lordlyhour> we need some art. WIth Rainbow reading a book
<Mason_Trowel> ...wait.

<ShadTheCrazed> Because the Space Core likes mmm, bananas.
<Lordlyhour> We need more official ponies
<Synros> 8your favorite demigod has returned
<Lordlyhour> the lack of Ponies is making us all go loopy

<Mason_Trowel> Well, I'm of the opinion that if it has already been murdered, I may as well make it useful.
<Synros> 8no silly
<EspyLacopa> shoo shoo be doo
<Turgle> hey Synros THE mod
<Nashy> That is faulty logic.
<FallSilently> Was this already on your list of things to do today?
<Synros> 8its Turgle...the doubter
*Mason_Trowel shrugs
<Nashy> The more people buy meat, the more is produced.
<Octavia> nope, it was added to it
<Synros> 8lol
<Turgle> :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> that is faulty logic, though I'm not vegetarian, that is stupid
<FallSilently> The system is working, then.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> yeah
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> what nashy is saying
<Turgle> remember the /kick command

<Lunasta> You awesome Octy
<Synros> 8scary s**t right there
<MeteorVenture> btw AllisZero i listen to many types of songs.. including Jpop and anime songs
<Mason_Trowel> Seconded
<Nashy> Eat meat if you must, but don't try to justify it with faulty logic.
<Mason_Trowel> I just agreed that your logic is sound and I my logic was faulty
<Nashy> Indeed.
<MeteorVenture> in fact alot of anime and video games songs
<Zanzibar> I eat meat because it tastes good. I really don't need any more logic than that myself. I simply don't care if some animals have to get put down for it.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> seriously though, i'm too lazy to be a vegetarian
<Mason_Trowel> Doesn't mean I'll stop eating meat, but to each his own.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i love vegetarian food
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> but i'm too damn lazy to cook it
<Mason_Trowel> I hate vegetables is the REAL reason I could never be a vegetarian
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> or find easy recipies
<Nashy> I am extremely lazy.
<Turgle> uh
<Lordlyhour> I like certain vegetbles
<Turgle> i like anime songs
<Mason_Trowel> My diet consists almost solely of meat and processed food products.
<Turgle> but i never know what to type in the search bar
<Lordlyhour> But I;d never survive being a vegetarian
<Zanzibar> Amen to that Mason.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> :/^ heart disease
<Nashy> But vegetarian food isn't harder to cook.
<Lordlyhour> because I like to smother anything that isn;t meat in cheese
<Nashy> Just microwave some soy hotdogs or whatever.

<Lordlyhour> so, if that ever happened, werrrl
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> and lentil pies

<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Lordlyhours_CholestorlLevels!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> still... could I really give up steak... probably, i don't really eat it that often anyway
<EspyLacopa> Go watch Usagi Drop
<EspyLacopa> For Rin is adorable.
<MeteorVenture> if you got time to watch MLP you got time to watch some quality anime shows
<Turgle> ^
<Turgle> true
<Mason_Trowel> I prefer to just go to the store, buy up about half a dozen froze Party Pizzas and a couple cases of soda, and just subsist on that for awhile.
<Nashy> Well it's not an absolute.
<Nashy> You can cut down on meat.
<FallSilently> I'll be back in a little while, I promised the budgie a bath.
<Turgle> usagi drop?
<FallSilently> On Friday.
<Turgle> oook
<Mason_Trowel> It is only thanks to my incredible metabolism that I am only 136 lbs
<EspyLacopa> Yes.
<FallSilently> He's probably wondering when it'll happen.
<Turgle> i'll look for a torrent
<MeteorVenture> i haven't seen usagi drop myself
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> yeah that sounds like a good start
<FallSilently> See yiz.
<Synros> 8i prefer FMA as my anime of choose
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i hate thinking of where my food comes from because I love animals
<EspyLacopa> Single working guy attends his grandfather's funeral, and finds out his grandpa had a 5 year old daughter.
<Lordlyhour> To the moon with 'em aye?
<Octavia> it is surprisingly difficult being a vegatarian
<Nashy> Get rid of the random everyday junk meat people eat.
<EspyLacopa> A 5 year old daughter the rest of the family doesn't want to take care of.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> especially colourful ponies :D:D
<RobotPinkie> There's a lot of anime I like... very hard to choose a favorite
<Nashy> It's hard to be a vegetarian at restaurants.
<ShadTheCrazed> I'm 200+ pounds. .-.
<Lordlyhour> i'm 90 kilos
<Nashy> I weigh 65 kg
<EspyLacopa> There is a massive amount of anime.
<Nashy> D_D
<EspyLacopa> Only a small portion is actually /good/
<Hayfever> Nashy, yes, going out to eat is a pain
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> metric system ftw
<Zanzibar> I 70 Kg on this meat eater.
<RobotPinkie> maybe Martian Successor Nadesico
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> and nashy.... 65kg also
<EspyLacopa> Irresponsible Captain Tylor.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> but i'm fair short
<RobotPinkie> ...or Azumanga Daioh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> no fat though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> not*
<Lordlyhour> I MUST AWAY
<Mason_Trowel> 5'6" tall, 136 lbs
<AllisZero> Azumanga is awesome.
<Nashy> Only thing that keeps my weight from dropping is eating snacks and candy, etc.
<EspyLacopa> Yukari-mobile!
<Hayfever> 65-70? yall are tiny
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> the hell is a lbs?
<Mason_Trowel> I am a small, thin little man.
<Lordlyhour> FOR THE MAGICAL LAND OF BEDDIE BYE CALLETH TO ME!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> whats that in kg
<Dermathil> what you all talking about?
<Mason_Trowel> Pounds. Imperial weight measurement.
<EspyLacopa> current favorite anime is One Piece

<Mason_Trowel> Your metric system can buck it. :P
<Lordlyhour> IT SAYS "LORDLY, LORDLY, COME TO ME. COME AND PLAY WITH THE PONIES!"
<RobotPinkie> I really like Banner of the Stars, also
<Turgle> i can't find the torrent D:
<Mason_Trowel> o long, Lordly
<Mason_Trowel> *So
<AllisZero> Full Metal Alchemist is one of the best I've ever seen for sure
<EspyLacopa> For Usagi Drop, Turgle?
<Nashy> Hayfever: I cheat and eat meat sometimes. Mostly because if I eat out there's like 2 vegetarian options and I can't eat either of them.
<Turgle> eeeeyup
<Lordlyhour> so, everyone here, stay sexy
<Lordlyhour> but remember I'm sexier
<RobotPinkie> Oh, and Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi

<MeteorVenture> i like anime like detective conan.. death note.. code geass.. monster
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lordies
<Synros> 8thank you AllisZero thank you
<Hayfever> Nashy, i just refuse to eat red meat at all. i will eat chicken once in a blue moon if i am out with clients or such
<Mason_Trowel> My brother attempted being Vegan. He said it was ricidulously difficult.
<Turgle> digimon
*Michael89pl 's height: 185 cm. Weight: ~55kg
<RobotPinkie> Death Note was great
<Fireant> Michael, you are almost a skeleton.
<Synros> 8no Turgle....
<MeteorVenture> and a variety of others.. i used to watch digimon when i was a kid
<Nashy> My sense of taste pretty much hates everything except a few things.
<Turgle> xD
<Fireant> 176 cm, 92 kg.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> my uncle is a vegan
<Michael89pl> maybe :p
<Turgle> me too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> crazy man
<MeteorVenture> i liked it more than pokemon lol
<Synros> 8DeathNote was good
<AllisZero> I liked Death Note but I'm somewhat biased against it because of its fanbase
<Mason_Trowel> Michael, in American you're what we call a "bean pole".
<Nashy> 174, 65
<Mason_Trowel> Really tall, and REALLY skinny.
<Hayfever> lets see, i am...
<Michael89pl> Mason, Im Russian :)
<Fireant> I am stunty, boysterous, bulwark guy.
<RobotPinkie> "Dear Princess Celestia"
<MeteorVenture> i didn't know of the fanbase of deathnote before watching it.. i just knew it was popular
<Nashy> I lose weight automatically if I stop eating junk food and stuff
<ShadTheCrazed> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dju-xCstbZ0&feature=related
<Hayfever> 180cm and 78kg
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about nostalgia critic reads cupcakes
<Synros> 8Digimon, digital monster, Digimon are the champions....derp
<Fireant> I look like charging, angry, scottish barrel.
<Nashy> But I barely eat anything.
<RobotPinkie> I don't know anything about the Death Note fanbase, lol
<RobotPinkie> what makes them so bad?
<AllisZero> Patlabor was one of the first genuinely japanese series I watched. Still love it to this day
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lol <3 derpy
*EspyLacopa needs to finish watching Patlabor
*Hayfever hugs a DerpyBot!
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, I love Patlabor
<mook> Michael89pl: zdorov
<Mason_Trowel> I would probably be even thinner than I am now if I didn't subsist on one meal of Junk food a day and about a 6+ cans of Dr. Pepper.
<Hayfever> best bot ever
<EspyLacopa> And Planetes
<Nashy> I hate cooking and eating food is just a necessary evil.
<Fireant> Sure is Hayfever.
<Colson> Heeeeeeeeello everypony.
<Fireant> DerpyBot is the top 3 in cuteness.
<Aetreeis> hi there, Fireant
<RobotPinkie> still need to watch that one :(
<Fireant> Hello Aetreeis :)
<EspyLacopa> Cat Shit One was good.
<Nashy> I eat only dinner.
<Synros> 8Looney Toons is best anime
<Nashy> And some days I forget to eat dinner.
<FourCartridge> hey
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i eat lots
<Turgle> cat shit one!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> but i swim hardcore in the summer
<Nashy> I don't really even get hungry until 48 hours of not eating.
<RobotPinkie> Friendship is Magic is best anime!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> makes up for it
<Turgle> but we still at episode 1, right?
<Colson> I read that as "i eat lolis"
*AllisZero brohoofs RP
<EspyLacopa> There's only been a single episode of Cat Shit One.
<Colson> ._.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> haha
<^Stargazer> ...
<Turgle> k
<Hayfever> alright, gotta run to the store.
*RobotPinkie brohoofs AllisZero
<Mason_Trowel> I eat only when I'm hungry, which is typically once per day. Mostly I just drink soda. Lots of soda. In fact,I can honestly say I'd have M
<EspyLacopa> No idea when more episodes will come.
<Nashy> I sit by a computer all day.
<Mason_Trowel> *Much more money to my name if I didn't drink so much soda.
<AllisZero> As soon as I caught up with FiM, anime went all the way to the back of the bus to me
<Nashy> Yet still manage to lose weight.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i don't eat very often, but when I do I eat lolis
<Turgle> :D
<mook> i'm having spaghetti with sausages for dinner for a 3rd month already
<AllisZero> That had just never happened before, in all honesty
*Synros 8brohoofs the air...no one is there.
<mook> it's never getting old
<Colson> lol
<Leonon> you eat lolis?
<RobotPinkie> but yeah that's true, by the Japanese definition of "anime," American cartoons count
<Mason_Trowel> You eat little girls, Luna?
<MeteorVenture> anyone remember monster rancher?
*Wrek answers the brohoof call
<RobotPinkie> ANY cartoons count
*Turgle brohoofs THE mod
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> yes, yes i do
<EspyLacopa> RobotPinkie: That's because the japanese definition of anime is Animation.
<Lunasta> O.O
<Lunasta> Wut.
*Synros 8bans the Turgle
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i.... eat little girls they make me feel so bad
<Nashy> I made lots of pasta with quorn tomato sauce.
<RobotPinkie> Exactly, EspyLacopa
*Lunasta backs off from TG&PLuna
<EspyLacopa> Sure fire way to mess with hardcore anime fans: call them cartoons.
<Leonon> don't eat Scootaloo! it doesn't matter how much she tastes like chicken!
<Nashy> To microwave if I need to eat.
<Colson> but
<MeteorVenture> lols exactly ^
<Synros> 8:O
<Colson> scootaloo is a chicken
<Nashy> D:
<Synros> 8you know I love ya Turgle
<Nashy> Scootaloo is awesome.
<Synros> 8:3
<Iks> yeah
<MeteorVenture> i love anime.. but i still find that type of trolling hilarious
<Turgle> yay me too <3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lol, no, i don't eat little girls, i just said I eat lots and colson read it at "i eat lolis"
<EspyLacopa> It's rather funny how they rage about their cartoons being called out for being cartoons.
<RobotPinkie> Well, I don't see what's wrong with loving Japanese cartoons :P
<Mason_Trowel> I just got a terrible image of a commercial for Applebloom...as a meal. "But she doesn't taste like apple!" "We eat what we like!"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> rbd and scootaloo need to be together more season 2
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> plzplzplz
<MeteorVenture> lol
<mook> TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna: strange, i read it as lolis too
<Mason_Trowel> We are a degenerating bunch
<Leonon> you wrote it as lolis
<Mason_Trowel> I am ashamed of myself and my terrible imagination
<Colson> lol mook
<MeteorVenture> this is just like one of my japanese animes
<Nashy> I like when Dash shows up in Show Stoppers.
<Lunasta> You only now realize that
<Nashy> Along with the older sisters.
<RobotPinkie> ohwow, MGS reference in the house
<AllisZero> The problem is
<Synros> 8so I just hook up duel monitors....zomg modding is so much easier noaw.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> "[00:14:55] <TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i eat lots[00:15:01] <TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> but i swim hardcore in the summer[00:15:04] <Nashy> I don't really even get hungry until 48 hours of not eating.[00:15:04] <TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> makes up for it[00:15:13] <Colson> I read that as "i eat lolis""

<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> anyway, point is, twiluna is best ship
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> wait... what are we talking about again?
<Nashy> Dash is Scootaloo's surrogate sister.
<Mason_Trowel> Tuna
<Fireant> Michael89pl, szczerze, nie zauważyłem xD Czekam na 50 milionów ED, jestem z ED bardziej związany.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lol tuna
<Fireant> Niepatriotycznie.
<Mason_Trowel> That is what Twi/Luna is forever known as to me
<Fireant> And Now, into english!
<Synros> 8hmm I cannot see image
<Mason_Trowel> Tuna.
<Lunasta> You crazy Poles and your random letter language!
<RobotPinkie> Those are some ponies
<Nashy> http://s313265804.onlinehome.us/ shipping!
<RobotPinkie> Right click and copy link location, then paste in a new tab, Synros
<Turgle> so much derp in Rainbowdash eyes
<FourCartridge> Davenprt x Salty
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> twi/luna competes with twi/trixie but after reading spark, i think it pushed tuna over the line for me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> just so awesome
<Penguinz102||Certified> o_o
<mook> сразу леттея лангуаге
<Synros> 8the only image that pops up is 4chan.org
<Synros> 8sooo it better not be the naughties..
<Nashy> I don't like shipping :P
<RobotPinkie> lawl, it's not
<Nashy> Hence the satire random shipping generator.
<Mason_Trowel> That's a disappointing shipping site. No option for het only pairing.
<ShadTheCrazed> lol, tuna.
<RobotPinkie> The naughties are over, it's 2011 now :P
<EspyLacopa> We're in the teens now?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i like good shipping
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> when done well it's good
<Synros> 8lol you'd be surprised.
<RobotPinkie> I guess so
<Nashy> Bah, het only, like that ever mattered!
<AllisZero> Yeeeah nah, I'd be fairly sad of being banned!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> but then again, i'm a sucker for romance
<RobotPinkie> Damn, Minecraft's new terrain generation is amazing
<Nashy> I don't like romance.
<Nashy> Or love songs.
<Synros> 8is it just the leaked version or official?
<Nashy> Or love in general.
<Wrek> 05its leaked
<Colson> needs more gay shipping
<Wrek> 05but its awesome
<AllisZero> Suddenly, Wrek
<Wrek> 05played all of last night
<Mason_Trowel> You like good shipping that is good when done well? Isn't that the most redundant of redundancies?
<Synros> 8oh heyp Wrek
<Wrek> 05ohai
<RobotPinkie> Well, "leaked," though the terrain generation for the biomes that are in there is finished
<Synros> 8i r mod noaw! :3
<Lunasta> Keep the saucier ships to #EquestriaAfterDark or das boot will sent you to the MOOOONAH
<EspyLacopa> what's the difference?
<^Stargazer> ...
<Colson> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Colson!
*Colson grabs
<RobotPinkie> Between what and what? :P
<Colson> okay done.
<EspyLacopa> Watching Cat Shit One is like being back in a game of Counter Strike.
<Turgle> ^
<Nashy> You're the one bringing up saucy ships though D:
<Colson> who
<Lunasta> Nashy, so you have no heart?
<mook> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQuihD0hoI
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<mook> can't get enough of this song
<Wrek> 05bomb has been planted?
<Lunasta> That makes you undead... Which means....
<mook> (not pony related though)
<EspyLacopa> Hostage rescue map.
<Nashy> I don't believe in love.
<Lunasta> You're a zombie pony!
<Mason_Trowel> It doesn't get much 'saucier' than BerryPunch/FlyingSpaghettiMonster!
*Lunasta shoots Nashy
<RobotPinkie> Man, the giant mushrooms are so frickin' cool
*Mason_Trowel *Trollface*
<MeteorVenture> giant mushrooms in minecraft?
<Nashy> I'm not even a pony.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah
<MeteorVenture> they're stealing from terraria!
<Leonon> that's pretty saucy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lies
<Lunasta> Meh, a zombie is a zombie.
<RobotPinkie> lawl, sure they are :P
<Leonon> but I can do better
<MeteorVenture> inb4 minecraft fan rage
<Nashy> Also, learn to double-tap.
*Lunasta shoots Nashy again
<Leonon> Berry Punch X Pizza Pony
<Synros> 8lol Terraria pretty much stole MC and made it a sidescroler
<Wrek> 05but then again they all stole it from wow so meh
<Lunasta> Doubletap!? Pfft, I have a shotgun
<Synros> 8ohhh just made it MV
<Lunasta> Doubletap not needed to kill a face.
<Wrek> 05which stole it form anotehr game with large mushrooms
<RobotPinkie> They all stole the giant mushrooms from Mario
<Nashy> humbug
<Wrek> 05which stole it from another game with large mushrooms
<MeteorVenture> which stole everything they had from pong and asteroids
<Synros> 8ha
<Nashy> well time for today's evil cooking
<EspyLacopa> they stole their stuff from tripping hippies
<AllisZero> gameception?
<MeteorVenture> which stole that idea from spartans
<ShadTheCrazed> Magneto is now a meme.
<Synros> 8 que the foghorn
<Mason_Trowel> Berry Punch X Pizza Pony is saucy, but pizza can be ordered without sauce. I do so all the time. The Flying Spaghetti Monster, however, has sauce running throught its very veins. Its noodly, stringy veins.
<Lunasta> Memeneto?
<mook> marvel was acquired by disney last year, amirite?
<RobotPinkie> Pong? Neigha please. :P http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two
<FourCartridge> I think so.
<MeteorVenture> fortuitous tennis
<Colson> lol
<RobotPinkie> Quite cool, that.
<Mason_Trowel> By the way, I actually said that earlier statement out loud in the voice of Professor Hubert Farnsworth of "Futurama".
<EspyLacopa> Table tennis?
<Mason_Trowel> I am so tired right now... XD
<MeteorVenture> i have to go.. i gotta take a dang shower and go to church.. right when this conversation is getting into something i can really talk about
<RobotPinkie> aw, later MeteorVenture
<Synros> 8k, cya later then
<MeteorVenture> video games and anime lol
<Turgle> bye! :)
<MeteorVenture> well take care yall:D i will find you a good anime that i recommend later turgle
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Turgle> yay
<Synros> 8don't worry about it, Turgle won't be here long
<Lunasta> Off to game I shall, so be a dear and be a pal!
<Leonon> Good news everyone! I've invented a machine that makes you read this in my voice!
<Synros> 8haha. muhahahahahaha
<Nashy> Evil cooking can wait.
*Synros 8coughs
<TF2BLUBoss_Lunasta> You mean TTS Leo?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Nashy> Reading stuff in people's voice doesn't really work.
<Turgle> http://www.myfacewhen.com/i/520.png
<Leonon> http://thedemotivators.com/wp-content/uploads/original/2010_04/good-news-everyone.jpg
<Mason_Trowel> Clearly you have not ben to the Joker's TVTropes page.
<Nashy> Unless you read at the rate of normal speech.
<Mason_Trowel> *been
<mook> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O61YEFsuo4
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<Synros> 8no Turgle.
<mexican> hi, just passing by
<mook> derpy's db got wiped?
<Leonon> better pic -> http://themavesite.com/TMS-Pictures/2011-01/GoodNewsEveryone.jpg
<Turgle> AHAHAHAHAHAHHA http://myfacewhen.com/i/503.jpg
<Turgle> omg
<Turgle> hahahahahahaha
<johnsey|semiAFK> mook: no, it's because "Unfortunately, this UMG-music-content is not available in Germany because GEMA has not granted the respective music publishing rights."
<Nashy> Doesn't work.
<Synros> 8no more images k
<Nashy> Brain parses written information much faster than verbal information.
<AlphaOmega> neither does that pic from Leonon , it said there was too many redirect loops
<Turgle> pffft
<Synros> 8lol
<RobotPinkie> Aw, no images?
<Turgle> no, don't worry
<mexican> same here
<Turgle> he is trolling me xD
<Turgle> THE mod
<RobotPinkie> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/22.png
<johnsey|semiAFK> works fine for me
<Mason_Trowel> Well, one can possess the illusion of reading something in someone's voice. I know, because I most certainly do on several occasions.
<Synros> 8yes only pony pictures, but don't over do it
<johnsey|semiAFK> must be your browser :D
<Turgle> :O
<Awesomeshy> ohai MewlightSparkle
<EspyLacopa> Bubblebeard is awesome
<Synros> 8bubbles beards are off topic
<MewlightSparkle> hello
<RobotPinkie> lol
<mexican> brb
<Synros> 8and just silly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i can't read fanfic in the chars voices without getting annoyed at myself
<Synros> 8like you said its 2011, and u teens
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i have to stop myself from reading it in the voices or it takes way too long
<Nashy> Yeah you can do that... It's just slow.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> mm
<EspyLacopa> http://img.ponibooru.org/images/bf/bf37cf61af108e2f1f5755424f14900a <-- YAR!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> also, i'll sit there and change the voice untill it sounds perfect in my head
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> so tedious
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> lol
<Nashy> It doesn't happen unintentionally like these "you are now reading this in my voice" images seem to suggest.
<Mason_Trowel> I prefer my reading slow and in-depth. I certainly can read at fast speeds. But slower is preferable to feeding my imagination.
<Synros> 8YAR!
<Turgle> YAR!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i read slowly
<ShadTheCrazed> Downloading Eurobeat Brony's singing. :D
<Pontang> Hey
<TheGreatAndPowerfulLuna> i enjoy what i'm reading more
<Mason_Trowel> Certain writings can encourage someone to read more slowly without them realizing it though.
<Synros> 8inb4 to many people show up
<Pontang> How's it going?
<Mason_Trowel> Like the example provided earlier, The Joker's TVTropes page.
<Nashy> I read fast and skip some words, brain fills them in.
<RobotPinkie> This chat is now about Metroidvania games http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/293.jpg
<Nashy> I just reread if something wasn't clear.
<Mason_Trowel> Reading the tropes in depth, since they are written as though "in-character" it makes you want to read it "as the character"
<johnsey|semiAFK> Nashy: happens unintentionally for me sometimes, i guess the brain doesn't work the same for everyone
<Turgle> xD
<Nashy> Yeah, YMMV.
*johnsey|semiAFK fondles NightmareMoon
<Nashy> My brain is more machine-like than most.

<MewlightSparkle> doing good, slightly tired, decided to join 3 different Pony IRCs lol

<Mason_Trowel> I really should be going to bed...
<Awesomeshy> oh
<Mason_Trowel> I can't exactly afford to have a fully reversed sleep schedule.
<Pontang> Cool. Your head is going to spin. Bronies spam talk. XD
<FourCartridge> I had one during the summer. it was not pleasnt.
<Awesomeshy> I assumed networks, not channels lol
<Mason_Trowel> Okay, well, I'll do it now, while I'm thinking about it. Good night, everypony. ^_^
<eXAKR> I know that
<FourCartridge> But at least i had alone time.
<Pontang> Eh, all the same.
<eXAKR> Few years ago I sunk into one
<eXAKR> Sucked
*Mason_Trowel waves

<Michael89pl> !Minecraft1.8
<Dark_Heart> best of luck
<Michael89pl> :p
<Colson> ...QuickTime
<Colson> VLC
<RobotPinkie> I prefer A.D. and B.C. though, I think it's silly to change it now...
<Colson> something like that
<Nashy> VLC plays EVERYTHING.
<Dark_Heart> can we please watch something else
<SolariSeto> Its true
<Leonon> my VLC doesn't like MKVs
<RoyKirbs> Volume Liquidator Consumer.
<Nashy> mine does
<RobotPinkie> No can do, Dash has taken over the stream
<Leonon> it plays them but it does so begrudgingly
<Synros> 8sry no can do Dark_Heart. streamer went afk for the next hour
<johnsey|semiAFK> then your MKV is borked!
<AllisZero> 0^
<RoyKirbs> Mario Koopa Vomit.
<KershaFangs> I like VLC, Quicktime annoys me because for a site I frequent it makes a browser player and keeps me from easily downloading the files.
<RobotPinkie> She won't stop until you're 100% seduced

<ShadTheCrazed> EUrobeat Brony: "I occasionally play Hat Fortress 2".
<Dark_Heart> sweet
<RobotPinkie> Well it's just 1.5 times as much as 20%, so "about" 20%
<johnsey|semiAFK> quicktime's sole purpose is being a virus magnet, although flash is heading strong fo that position and probably overtook it by now
<Nashy> Stare Master.
<Unidentified59305> Talking about Magneto and Mine Craft.
<ItalianStallion99> what the... you guys are STILL ON HERE? I've been gone for like 2 god damn days!
<EspyLacopa> Bronies never die.
<Nashy> Sweetie Belle is about to sing...
<Turgle> Bro force
<ShadTheCrazed> You know, for some strange reason, Eurobeat Brony's voice sounds similar.
<Das> wow that was a nice high there man
<ShadTheCrazed> To someone I know. Maybe it's just me.
<Bjornfot> Who's this Synros guy, anyway?
<ItalianStallion99> wait a minute... space time continuum usually screws up the time on my trips. i was in equestria for at LEAST 48 hours. how long was i really gone for?

<RobotPinkie> She's "saying hi" to us right now, in fact...
<Dark_Heart> with her eyes
<ItalianStallion99> lol yeah just look to the left of this chat
<ItalianStallion99> anyways
<KershaFangs> So is there any codec that makes Window MEdia Player MP4 copmpatible?
*^Stargazer watches random things on youtube
<ItalianStallion99> I was fortunate enough to be able to stay at Twilights while I was there. HEr house smells like wood.
<Iks> uhhm ffdshow?
<Dark_Heart> i bet
<KershaFangs> Isn't that a convertor?
<Turgle> LOL
<Dark_Heart> .......... why Celestia why?
<Iks> no its a... codecpackage
<Iks> or something
<ItalianStallion99> and Pinkie actually was having a party the moment i materialized into the room.
<ItalianStallion99> it was akward
<Synros> 8just mute it Dark_heart
<Das> lol
<Synros> 8thats wat I did :p
<Dark_Heart> it is
<Synros> 8oh
<Dark_Heart> its the image
<Synros> 8:O
<Iks> or get mediaplayer classic
<Synros> 8RBD is best pony
<Dark_Heart> screw it , I'm going to youtube
<Turgle> ^
<Dark_Heart> agreed
<Das> i lul at you synros
<ItalianStallion99> one thing that the producers don't let the kids know is that there is actually drinking and violence and... other stuff... in their world just like ours.
<ItalianStallion99> :(
<RobotPinkie> lol, you know you love it
<Nashy> naw, codecpacks are horrible and cause DLL hell
<Bjornfot> Silly Synros that's not how you spell Twilight.
<Iks> i had to use that one once with weird encoded mp4 files
<Turgle> gtg, cya everypony
<Iks> no they dont nashy
<KershaFangs> I hadf that but I don't think it worked. Or I just don't know how to make them work
<Das> thats not how you voth spell Rarity
<Bjornfot> These new mods... bah
<Nashy> ffdshow is awesome though
<Iks> ffdshow is basicly one codec that can playback anything
<johnsey|semiAFK> forget codecpacks, install VLC or smplayer
<Das> later brah
<ItalianStallion99> cya
<ItalianStallion99> GUYS GUESS WHAT I DID
<Synros> 8yes Bjornfot?
<ItalianStallion99> nah i dont wanna make anyone jealous
<ItalianStallion99> although i do love jello
<RobotPinkie> you fantasised about Dash again, I take it
<Nashy> codecpacks are just a bunch of files that get installed to system32 and can't be uninstalled
<Synros> 8I'm sry I don't come with explosions, cars, and machine guns
<Dark_Heart> damn, I almost forgot that today is 9/11's tenth anniversary
<User_2254> flkkn lckhn:)
<Iks> well just can just delete system32
<Michael89pl> they can be uninstalled
<User_2254> YEW NEED TO GO TWO DA MOON
<ItalianStallion99> Nope. While i was in Equestria i asked Rainbow Dash if I could pet her on the head, and SHE LET ME DO IT. It was freakin awesome but only lasted a couple seconds :(
<Das> i ahve all that
<Nashy> I haven't used codecpacks in years, ffdshow and VLC made them redundant
<User_2254> TUMBLR ON DUTY
<Das> i obce petted a rainbow dash once but it was expensive
<Das> once
*^Stargazer is scared of youtube, shakes in corner
<ItalianStallion99> youve been to equestria too?
<User_2254> EPIK
<Das> no hollis and queens
<ItalianStallion99> ooo
<KershaFangs> I've downloaded codecpacks but they didn't do anything. :<
<ItalianStallion99> the real one is better
<Das> i know QQ
<Das> she made me do things after it was scary
<ItalianStallion99> shes so soft.... and beautifull.... and sex-ALRIGHT MOVING ON
<johnsey> why can't i hold all these codecs?
<Nashy> Because they are not physical objects.
<Nashy> Anti-joke chicken.
<ItalianStallion99> Oh another thing i should mention: drunk ponies are fuckiong hilarious!!!
<SolariSeto> What was that?
<Dark_Heart> lol
<johnsey> Nashy: unless you print them!
<ItalianStallion99> The mane six were there and the only one who wasnt getting... tipsy... was twilight
<Nashy> But then you're not holding the codec...
<Dark_Heart> thats Twi
<Nashy> You're holding a printout of some representation of the data in it.
<johnsey> who cares about a c less or more?
<Synros> 8what are you talkign about IS?
<ItalianStallion99> yep. she says she can handle it but i dont think she can
<johnsey> why can't i hold all these code?
<ItalianStallion99> I went to equestria remember?

<Luna_In_Socks> Hi Sketchy!!!

<Nashy> Eh, play that annoying battle again. I'll skip that.
<prince-dari> Aren't you enjoying it? :P
<Iks> it was
<^PinkiePie> How do you people discover these so fast?
<Dark_Heart> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<MrPoniator> Nashy, you don't have to play the boss battle to achieve it
*Cat stabs Jason
*Shaico is making a justin Tv account so he can show off.
<Luna_In_Socks> ^Pinkie Pie: See also: Infinite Monkeys Theory.
<Synros> 8seriously Dari.....
<Shaico> :3
<Jason> OMG Curly
<MrPoniator> Two of the three endings are achieved with the boss battle, the third is a bit different
<FourCartridge> It's the internet. word travels very fast.
<Jason> I GOT BLUE PAPER TOWELS
<^PinkiePie> Is the game long?
<MrPoniator> And that the game itself hints to it
*Jason pets Cat
<Jayne_Cobb> I am starting to hate Rainbow Dash just from overexposure.
<MrPoniator> Nah, 10min tops
*Jason lights Cat on fire
<Iks> i thought the song was longer
<Synros> 8my d'awwww meter hit full like 40 minutes ago
<Iks> like 30 secs or so
<TheItalianStallion99> Oh come on. Inter-universal traveling, talking magic ponies, and secret attic basements? this is all normal!!!!
<Nashy> Word travels at close to C.
<Iks> the one ingram uploaded
<Synros> 8oh gawd
<MrPoniator> And FourCartridge, there are some hints in the game and so forth
<KershaFangs> I just wanted to know. After learning about Zalgo and Creepypasta, I am apprehensive about all.
<MrPoniator> Didn't take long for people to find that ending
*EspyLacopa goes and listens to fantasia
<Hayfever> WWU o/~
<FourCartridge> So amI, to the point where I'm desensitized to it all.
<Synros> 8hmmm im go try that
<ShadTheCrazed> Dang it, I wanna show this place my singing talent.
<MrPoniator> Well, there's a video of it on YOuTube, if you just wanna check that one out instead
<Hayfever> i guessed it lulz
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh, and I've also gotta find a way to make music.

<Synros> 8:3
<TheItalianStallion99> so i need a checklist. who's comind to Equestria later?

<Nashy> My only "musical" contribution to the internet is a song about kittuns in bags.
<Bjornfot> AWW YEAH TIME WARP
<Synros> 8just came
<herospirit> I'll try Italian. I'll try.
<Dark_Heart> LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!!!!! and this time with feeling
<MrPoniator> But yeah. The third ending is pretty much: talk to everyone (talk to Pinkie before handing down all the invintations) including the pets, give derpy a good muffin and then head back to Zecora when your computer's clock is set between 11PM and 5AM
<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm.
<TheItalianStallion99> Me, herospirit, who else?
<ShadTheCrazed> But dang it, I wanna sing and stuff.
<^PinkiePie> Oh god
<^PinkiePie> Pinkie said the hacksaw line
<herospirit> But my belief stat is far too low for the travel to your attic.
<Dark_Heart> i'll try to make it IT99, no mpromises
<Synros> 8there is Bjornfot
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I was kinda weirded out by the random line
<Synros> 8wb

<herospirit> LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET'S DOOOOOOO THE TIME WAAAAARP
<herospirit> AGAIIIIN
<Bjornfot> Oh, I've been her all the time. Silently watching you all.
<ShadTheCrazed> I saw a recording of the 3rd ending for Super Filly World.
<TheItalianStallion99> dont worry everyone, i have enough belief to go around
<Synros> 8ah, plotting my demise?
<ShadTheCrazed> That startled me. o_o
<Dark_Heart> lol
<FourCartridge> They made a SMW hack?
<MrPoniator> Super Filly Adventure
<ShadTheCrazed> It isn't a SMW hack
<FourCartridge> oh
<herospirit> For really trully Stallion? :3
<TheItalianStallion99> you know what? EVEYRBODY HERE IS INVITED. ur welcome
*FourCartridge has dshed hopes

<Synros> 8then I'm stuck with boring old grey
<Nashy> They already made like 3 mario games with ponies D:
<herospirit> Do Ponies know how to do the timewarp?
<^PinkiePie> So this game features the Cupcakes version of PP
<FourCartridge> 2
<Hayfever> sweeeeetiebelllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it

<^PinkiePie> Sweetie Belle?
<Hayfever> HARDCOREROCKOUT
<^PinkiePie> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Dark_Heart> its gust a step to the left
<TheItalianStallion99> i havent brought anyone else to earth yet
<MrPoniator> She just quotes the hacksaw line, but doesn't do anything non-Pinkie, really
<Dark_Heart> and then jump to the right
<^PinkiePie> Or is it insane Applejack?
<TheItalianStallion99> OH I GOTTA GO NOW ILL SEE YOU ALL AT 2:00
<MrPoniator> No one's insane
<Nashy> Sweetie Belle version is so much better.
<TheItalianStallion99> bye
<Dark_Heart> see ya
<MrPoniator> Something else is
*herospirit rummages through dirty clothing
<Nashy> yay
<MrPoniator> But yeah, don't talk to Pinkie after handing down the invintations, if you want the third ending
<Sidestroke> *Sweetie Belle is so much better.
<Sidestroke> FTFY
<Luna_In_Socks> Budgie just had a heart attack, thanks.
*herospirit equips moderately clean shirt and wind pants in preperation for party
<^PinkiePie> I made "Muffins?"
<MrPoniator> No third ending for you then
<Dark_Heart> so what are we going to watch now?
<MrPoniator> Unless it accepts that muffin too
<Hayfever> CMCcccccccccccccc
<ShadTheCrazed> I have thought of some ponified lyrics to Profesor E. Gadd's theme.
<Hayfever> yesssss
<Hayfever> o/~
<Luna_In_Socks> I've always wondered what this song would sound like it Scootaloo wasn't singing it. They deliberately gave her an awful singing voice.
<MrPoniator> But yeah, I'm pretty sure the game's gaining popularity just because of that ending
<^PinkiePie> She's gonna try to fight a dragon
<Nashy> Someone should write "Anarchy in Equestria".
<^PinkiePie> I talked to PP.
<Iks> well ingram said there is a good sung version of the song
<Iks> now we only need to force him to release it

<Mittenfingers> !8ball Are you working?
<Synros> 8ok mods are on, now I sleep
<Mittenfingers> Aww... no 8ball function?
<^PinkiePie> I'm guessing the grimdark ending deals with derpy
<prince-dari> :o
<Dark_Heart> something funny
<EspyLacopa> O.o
<prince-dari> Ok Synros, night.
<prince-dari> Or, err.
<MrPoniator> Pinkie, no
<prince-dari> Morning.
<Synros> 8no sleep?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good night synros
<^PinkiePie> Ok, then I'll just find out.
<MrPoniator> Just that one of the requirements is giving a good muffin to depry
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, I'll be checking dA for a bit.
<Leonon> Turns out I didn't need Paul Bunyun's incarnation to help me with the tree I needed to clean up, I just ripped it out of the ground with my bare hands
<Synros> 8I hope I didn't leave the chat in that much a bad condition
<Luna_In_Socks> This is the song I'm least familiar with due to the chorus being annoying and it being in my least favey episode.
<Mittenfingers> You should be a lumberjack then.
<Synros> 8lol
<Dark_Heart> lol
<MrPoniator> First and second endings are pretty much the same. Just that the difference is if Derpy's at the party or not
<Bjornfot> nice
<Nashy> What's left... That Grand Galloping Gala Pinkie song...
<Synros> 8ok nitenite
<ValtheJean> 2,14 "He was a great teacher! I didn't learn anything"

<TheItalianStallion99> and luna's republic
<Thorinair> actually, no
<thunder-colt> One of the two questions theologists have been pursuing since the dawn of time; 1. What is the meaning of existence, and 2. Why do I have a boner in the morning?
<Thorinair> this was rendered in Blender

<Apokalipse> Luna has da magics, what good is modern weaponry?

<TheItalianStallion99> Blizzard 3 year plan includes two world of warcraft starcraft II add ons
<TheItalianStallion99> :D
<Luna> 07UPDATE] Activision Blizzard COO Thomas Tippl says publisher expects six releases from studio, including Diablo III and one expansion.
<Luna> 07:(
<Wrek> 05activision was the worst thing that could happen to blizzard
<Luna> 07Goodbye philosophy we release when it's ready
<Luna> 07Agreed Wrek
<Wrek> 05i prefer when its ready
<herospirit> Who are you all going to war with? :0
<Wrek> 05that way you can expect top notch quality
<Apokalipse> wait... so diablo III is still not out?
<VioletVanilla> 6Activision joined Blizzard??
<Luna> 07lol
<Dashite> Bought.
<Dashite> Not joined.
<Dashite> Although technically, Activision merged with Vivendi or something which owned Blizzard.
<Luna> 07yea a while ago though...
<TheItalianStallion99> Are only admins allowed to use colors?
<TheItalianStallion99> just asking
<Luna> 07Oui
<Wrek> 05yes.

<VioletVanilla> 6LOL Spike is disappoint~
<Awesomeshy> this domain will mask to that one
<Awesomeshy> so you shouldn't need to change your embed
<prince-dari> Cool, thanks.
<TheItalianStallion99> hey guys im making a fan-fic about a human in equestria and so far im on part 2 and hes like explaining himself to the ponies what should happen to him?
<Apokalipse> depends
<Apokalipse> does he like bannanas?
<TheItalianStallion99> umm i dont know
<mib_vtp7pw> he falls in love with luna
<Wrek> 05TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON BIATCH
<TheItalianStallion99> i guess hes a beeeyetch who doesnt like bananas
<mib_vtp7pw> lol
<Zephirdd> wait
<mib_vtp7pw> thats why he falls in love with luna
<Zephirdd> is he a human in equestria as in, a human
<Zephirdd> or a pony with the mind of a human?
<Dark_Heart> have him throw a huge party with Pinky Pie
<TheItalianStallion99> it has to make SOME sense guys
<TheItalianStallion99> lol
<Zephirdd> as in, a human who was transformed into a pony
<Zephirdd> ?
<VioletVanilla> I agree with Wrek
<VioletVanilla> 6TOOO THE MOOOOOONAAAAAHHHH!!!
<Dark_Heart> Have a pony come to the human world
<mib_vtp7pw> luna
<Dark_Heart> and turn into a human
<TheItalianStallion99> Here's the prologue: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d492spz
<mib_vtp7pw> LUNA
<TheItalianStallion99> Then part 1: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d49a3n2
<TheItalianStallion99> in case anyone has patience to skim through it, lol
<Dark_Heart> wow, your better at this writing stuff then I am
<TheItalianStallion99> lol, what can i say? haha
<TheItalianStallion99> im still not the best
<TheItalianStallion99> obviously haha
<mib_vtp7pw> make him fall for luna please
<Zephirdd> silly anon
<mib_vtp7pw> lol
<Zephirdd> everypony falls for luna
<mib_vtp7pw> true
<TheItalianStallion99> hm... i guess maybe Luna lets him stay in the Canterlot castle in her own little section
<mib_vtp7pw> yes
<TheItalianStallion99> but im not much of a romantic writer. and also, i wanted him to have shenanigans in ponyvills
<mib_vtp7pw> yay
<Dark_Heart> STORY IDEA: Luna gets transported into the human world after Twilight screwed up a spell. Luna turns into a human, but keeps her moon powers, and creates problems in our world for fun.
<mib_vtp7pw> hmmm luna gives him a tour of ponyville?
<TheItalianStallion99> well hes already meeting 4 of the mane six so my plan was for him to stay with one of them
<mib_vtp7pw> ok
<TheItalianStallion99> but i promise he will meet luna. idk about fall in love
<Dark_Heart> which of the mane 6
<mib_vtp7pw> k luna ftw
<Zephirdd> I wonder if someone explained how does the MLP physics work in some fic out there
<Zephirdd> as in, gravity and such
<TheItalianStallion99> he met twilight first, as i said in part 1, then fluttershy, and then he met AJ and RDB at the same time and the story leaves off when theyre all there
<TheItalianStallion99> *RBD
<Zephirdd> because Celestia and Luna are the ones who raise the sun/moon, so how does it work?
<TheItalianStallion99> MAGIC
<Dark_Heart> what type of pony is he, and he should stay with RBD
<Zephirdd> yeah, but I wonder if someone explained it :P
<Zephirdd> lol
<Zephirdd> so its a human who turned into a pony?
<TheItalianStallion99> He's a human who traveled through time-space and doesnt know how he got there
<TheItalianStallion99> read the prologue, it explains it: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d492spz
<Zephirdd> oh yeah, its a human in equestria, not a ponyfied human
<mib_vtp7pw> phew
<mib_vtp7pw> makes more sense to the ponies now
<TheItalianStallion99> yeah.
<TheItalianStallion99> he doesnt know how he got there and the ponies never heard of humans before
<TheItalianStallion99> which one do u think he should stay with and why?
<Zephirdd> duuh
<Zephirdd> Pinkie Pie
<Zephirdd> 1- he is pink
<Zephirdd> 2- he is totally different from everything
<Zephirdd> 3- she breaks the fourth wall more often than not
<Zephirdd> obv pinkie pie
<Turgle> 4- wears party hats
<Zephirdd> but quite honestly
<TheItalianStallion99> i was thinking either Twilight because she brought him into town, or applejack because she's the most down-to-earth pony of the group.
<Zephirdd> you should just put him to whoever you think is the best
<Zephirdd> IMO the most logical would be twilight
<TheItalianStallion99> (fluttershy is too quiet, rainbow dash lives in the sky, rarity...well... idk.)
<Zephirdd> rarity would consider him ugly-as-hell
<Zephirdd> =p
<TheItalianStallion99> i read a fanfic where someone falls in love with rarity and goes to equestria
<TheItalianStallion99> and rarity falls in love with them too
<TheItalianStallion99> and it goes further to cloppy things...
<Zephirdd> hugh
<TheItalianStallion99> ANYWAYS MOVING ON
<Zephirdd> :S
<TheItalianStallion99> This is your singing telegram i hope it finds you well
<FlutterBro> nice fic
<TheItalianStallion99> youre invited to a party cuz we think youre really swell
<TheItalianStallion99> ^^ thanks!
<TheItalianStallion99> Gummys turning one year old so help us celebrate
<TheItalianStallion99> The cake will be delicious, the festivities first-rate
<TheItalianStallion99> There will be games and dancing bob for apples cut a rug (POP)
<TheItalianStallion99> And when the party is over well gather round for a group hug
<TheItalianStallion99> No need to bring a gift, being there will be enough
<TheItalianStallion99> birthdays mean having fun with friends not getting lots of stuff
<TheItalianStallion99> it wont be the same without you so we hope that you say yes
<TheItalianStallion99> so please oh please RSVP and come and be our guest
<Zephirdd> lol love that song :P
*Jason taps Curly on the sholder and runs away
<TheItalianStallion99> theres the whole song for you guys
<TheItalianStallion99> is anyone else still here?
<Luna> 07oui
<TheItalianStallion99> iyes
<TheItalianStallion99> so luna, you prefer magic over modern warfare techniques, don't you?
<VioletVanilla> 6hyes~
<Luna> 07yes
<herospirit> kinda
<herospirit> Kinda still here.
<TheItalianStallion99> How would you handle an invasion of humans with modern weaponry? how would you defeat us? haha
<herospirit> Stallion, don't you remember Twilight ripping that water tower off it's stand?
<herospirit> Nuke at them = right back at us
<herospirit> : /
<TheItalianStallion99> oh god haha
<MrChang> nobody broadcasting? :(
<Luna> 07nope
<TheItallianStallion99> Nopony*
<herospirit> Hand to hand combat, they'd definitely have it over anyone not specially trained. There's a reason people say a hard hit was like getting kicked by a horse
<TheItallianStallion99> yeah horses and ponies have hard hooves too
<MrChang> ponies are horses
<TheItallianStallion99> we would need tanks and blockades with riot control and battering stuff and bombs
<herospirit> Though combat using weapons would probably go to us; Fingers and what not.
<TheItallianStallion99> yeah we have knives and bayonets too
<herospirit> I suppose unicorns could handle weapons, holding them with magic, but it would probably be awkward handling.
<DecapPony> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/memes-oshi1.jpg
<prince-dari> Let's face it.
<prince-dari> We'd lose because ponies are too cute to kill.
<Zephirdd> duh
<Zephirdd> obv
<Apokalipse> why use weapons if you have magic in the first place?
<Luna> 07One magic to rule you all
<Luna> 07waaaaaait
<Wacka> SURPRISE
<Luna> 07One magic-spell to rule you all
<Turgle> horn power
<VioletVanilla> 6ONE RING SILLY FILLY! ;D
<herospirit> Why NOT use weapons Apokalipse?
<TheItallianStallion99> My fan-fic isn't going to have conflict between humans and ponies
<Luna> 07nahhhh
<Luna> 07I don't need rings
<herospirit> Pony with a claymore = badass
<Luna> 07I have magic
<Apokalipse> Because magic is stronger
<Zephirdd> lol Claymore Pony would be badass]
<Turgle> http://i.imgur.com/CtoOa.jpg
<Turgle> pure magic
<Awesomeshy> ohai GGgala
<Zephirdd> altho its been like 7 months since I last read Claymore...
<herospirit> But spells take a while to cast. Remember how long it took Twilight to calm the Ursa Minor?
<herospirit> They'd need some battle Ponies to protect the casting Unicorns. :0
<herospirit> ....Wow, now the war sounds like a SRPG.
<GGgala> ohay
<Zephirdd> lol
<herospirit> Turgle, magic is everywhere in this bitch
<Turgle> :D
<TheItallianStallion99> In the fan-fic im making, Thomas is going to bring back his own cache of weapons to aid in Equestria in a conflict against a group of rebllious pony criminals using humans' covert operations and stealthiness to take them down. hell be give ann award for bravery in equestria
<Zephirdd> LOL
<Zephirdd> now THAT is awesome
<herospirit> So he's gonna teach Ponies how to fight dirty? :P
<TheItallianStallion99> i guess so haha
<TheItallianStallion99> the royal guards arent knowledgable about stealth
<TheItallianStallion99> TThomas will teach them how humans get 'er done
<WhatPayne> Oh my god! I just recovered from head splitting migraine
<Zephirdd> well
<Zephirdd> they are freaking white horses
<TheItallianStallion99> yeah
<Zephirdd> its not really easy to be "stealth"
<MeteorVenture> lols the italian stallion
<TheItallianStallion99> hes gonna come back throught the portal wearing came with black stripes on his face and bandanas and weapons and crap
<Zephirdd> lol
<Zephirdd> there is a portal?!
<Zephirdd> I thought he was trapped
<herospirit> And then fuck some rebel ponies UP
<Zephirdd> when this story gets to a good number of chapters I'll surely read it
<TheItallianStallion99> oops i gave a spoiler there
<TheItallianStallion99> well hell eventually figure out how to travel back and forth
<Zephirdd> heh
<Zephirdd> :P
<Zephirdd> this is going to be boss
<TheItallianStallion99> and hes gonna bring back stuff to assist
<TheItallianStallion99> brb guys
<Turgle> Rarity IS Industry xD
<Turgle> gotta listen to that
<Zephirdd> Ponies of the Caribbean
<Zephirdd> oh my
<Turgle> i don't like it :\
<Zephirdd> it has a nice tone imo
<Zephirdd> :P
<Apokalipse> Snooker is now a good cure for insomnia
<Zephirdd> lol
<Zephirdd> I know a good cure for insomnia
<Zephirdd> one sec
<Zephirdd> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v6BipcdfJo
<Turgle> oh awesome xD
<Apokalipse> lol
<Zephirdd> you can't not sleep
<Zephirdd> after Twilight asks you like that
<Turgle> if a tree falls in the forest will a squirrells insurance﻿ premium rise?"

<Luna> 07Fluttershy!
<Fluttershy> -le gasp- Luna! Hi ^^
<WhatPayne> Hello, Luna
<FreezeFrame> Flootershy!
<Luna> 07ready for some streamception?
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi Luna
*WhatPayne hugs Luna
<Zephirdd> !
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<Fluttershy> oooh actually speaking of streamception me and flutterbro were wanting to try something
<Luna> 07tell me in PM
<Zephirdd> Question
<Zephirdd> why not link Fluttershy's stream
<Zephirdd> directly into bronystate
<WhatPayne> Stream at the Bronystate.net?
<Zephirdd> rather than streamception it?
<Luna> 07cause it's a secret ;)
<Luna> 07nah we like to bring her in :)
<FlutterBro> We're just trying to get something to work
<Luna> 07ohai flutterbro
<Zephirdd> or make her get rights to bronystate's stream or something
<Zephirdd> cuz streamception creates a huge delay
<Luna> 07eeenope
<Luna> 07she's a regular
<Zephirdd> well, your call
<Luna> 07a
<RobotPinkie> yay!
<Luna> 07yay
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
*Luna meows at RobotPinkie
*VioletVanilla meows at RobotPinkie and Luna
*RobotPinkie purrs at VioletVanilla and Luna
<WhatPayne> Hello RobotPinkie, hello VioletVanilla
<RobotPinkie> ohay WhatPayne
<VioletVanilla> 6Halloooooo~
<WhatPayne> Haven't been able to IRC until now due to unforeseen migraine
<VioletVanilla> 6You have those too? >.<
<Luna> 07poor Payne
<Luna> 07you feel any better now?
<WhatPayne> Oh that's the one thing which is wrong with me
<WhatPayne> yes, thank you
*VioletVanilla hugs WhatPayne~
<RobotPinkie> That doesn't sound fun
<WhatPayne> Yes. I can tell you they are the worst.
<WhatPayne> Best thing about migraine is when it goes away it feels like you have been born again.
<herospirit> Hahaha, I know what you mean
<RobotPinkie> I don't get migraines, I just get really bad headaches.
<RobotPinkie> Not really comparable, from what I understand.
<herospirit> Though, when I wake up better after falling asleep with a sickness, it's less of a "born again" and more of a "where the fuck am I, what's my name again?"
<prince-dari> You are my servant, I am your God, and you worship me
<AllisZero> 0wiw
<WhatPayne> what?
<AllisZero> 0wow that was painful
<prince-dari> You have no name, you are just number 12.
<AllisZero> 0Yeah WhatPayne I can totally relate
<AllisZero> 0My headaches usually don't go away until the next morning though
<herospirit> Worst isolated sickness I've had was a flu. It was particularly bad because of my auto immune problems. Could only drink (and promptly vomit up) water for three days, and only eat jello for the rest of the week.
<AllisZero> 0Had to stop playing Deus X, started getting dizzy and I know where that leads
<WhatPayne> Oh. Right. Luckily I have pretty good migraine medicine, so that helps
<AllisZero> 0What do you use?
<WhatPayne> Uh, I have two medicines.
<RobotPinkie> "What's her name today?/What's her name today?/She could be anyone/I might have known you'd leave her crying"
<Fluttershy> oh hey prince-dari! Didn't we have fun last night? ^^
<prince-dari> Eeyup. :)
<AllisZero> 0http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/src/131576896576.png
<AllisZero> 0Fookin saved
<WhatPayne> Maxalt Rapitab that has Rizatriptan and Miranax that has Naproxen. natr.
<Fluttershy> ^^ hehe
<WhatPayne> And I just noticed that I'm almost out.
<WhatPayne> Dat wallpaper
<RobotPinkie> lawl saved indeed, AllisZero
<RobotPinkie> Perfect wallpaper for my Ubuntu box :P
<AllisZero> 0Yep
<AllisZero> 0Agree
<WhatPayne> Everyone has that one health thing. Mine is migraine.
<AllisZero> 0Alright I'm gonna go shower
<herospirit> Hot Patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll....
<herospirit> OH DAMNIT ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
<prince-dari> MFW I have no health thing.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I guess I have that one health thing too...
<VioletVanilla> 6I am. . . confused. . .
<WhatPayne> Only lucky ones have no health things.
<herospirit> I have, umm, one sec lemme think
<Fluttershy> I have two health things o-o
<herospirit> 5 health things? Nah, more than that
<herospirit> All I know is I take 12 pills a day for assorted things.
<WhatPayne> I mean I rarely get flu. Never have broken any bones. Do not bruise easily, etc. But I get migraines.
<WhatPayne> And damn herospirit
<RobotPinkie> So no streamception?
<Fluttershy> I get sick about every two months with a cold which has a very high chance of turning into bronchitis... and then I have carpal tunnel in both wrists. >>
<prince-dari> I really have no health problems.
<Fluttershy> streamception is coming
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Literally none.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Fluttershy> was just trying to see if something worked first
<RobotPinkie> Oh good, I really want to hear you sing Sea Ponies!
<Zephirdd> prince-dari: you are depressed and can't find emotion in most of the things that the majority of people find emotion in
<Zephirdd> how come you don't have health problems?
<Zephirdd> :|
<prince-dari> Meh, I'm not depressed, I just sometimes feel a bit down most likely due to my age.
<herospirit> I used to be healthy, then something called Graves Disease (which is the most foreboding sounding thing you can tell an 8 year old he has) popped up, but it took the doctor a year to admit I had something wrong with me, and that was because another doctor demanded it when I had a heart attack during school. :0
<RobotPinkie> lol, I'm just a bit too fat, basically...
<herospirit> I don't like the doctor who took a year. He said my horrible random nosebleeds were a behavioral problem.
<RobotPinkie> Ouch, I'm sorry to hear that, herospirit
<herospirit> Meh, I'm pretty much better now.
<Fluttershy> RobotPinkie if you want me to sing SeaPonies you're asking something that will not happen in this lifetime possibly >>
<prince-dari> Dooo eeet
<RobotPinkie> Aw, why not, Fluttershy?
<herospirit> They gave me radiation to kill my thyroid to fix it. Thyroid's growing back though, which probably shouldn't be happening. : /
<Fluttershy> because I would feel hightly ashamed to sing it? >>
<prince-dari> Sing nothing can stop the smooze then.
<prince-dari> :P
<herospirit> Yeees, bring the Smooze
<TheItallianStallion99> HEY GUYS IM BACK
<Zephirdd> >mfw I got disc after saying something to prince-dari
<Zephirdd> sorry?
<Zephirdd> .-.
<TheItallianStallion99> Check out this video about celestia and the moon
<TheItallianStallion99> here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
<RobotPinkie> aw, you shouldn't be ashamed, Fluttershy
<RobotPinkie> Seriously, it'll probably be the best rendition of Sea Ponies evar
<herospirit> Silly Stallion, we've seen that many times
<prince-dari> So what did you see me responsd to what you said or not Zephirdd?
<Zephirdd> I didnt
<herospirit> on another topic Stallion, do you like bananas?
<prince-dari> [20:36] <prince-dari> Meh, I'm not depressed, I just sometimes feel a bit down most likely due to my age.
<Zephirdd> that's why I try to live with a child's mind
<RobotPinkie> How old are you, prince-dari?
<Zephirdd> because growing up sucks
<Zephirdd> :P
<prince-dari> Fairly recently 16.
<Zephirdd> OH SHUT THE FUCK
<Zephirdd> WHAT?
<RobotPinkie> I'm never growing up, because fuck it, ponies.
<AllisZero> 0You don't sound 16

<DecapKing> You're in space? Cant explain that, therefore aliens
<LordCelestia> now.
<RDash> I am the best at space!
<LordCelestia> Yes ^
<RobotPinkie> I agree.
<RobotPinkie> Can't explain that.
<DecapKing> Being the best at space? Cant explain that
*Aristeo waves
<LordCelestia> I can explain.
<RobotPinkie> Also why does the Earth have a moon, but Mars doesn't? You can't explain that.
<RDash> RobotPinkie Err, I can
<LordCelestia> Actually, i dont feel like explaining
<RDash> :P
<LordCelestia> TL;DR
<Jason> hey Tricky
<RDash> ^yes
<prince-dari> Jason: Network move
<Jason> prince-dari: huh?
<EspyLacopa> Whatchu talking about, Pinkie?
<Jason> oh
<EspyLacopa> Mars has two moons.
<GrimGallop> The moon is a giant space rock that just happened to float into our orbit, clearly.
<RobotPinkie> No, you can't, RDash. You can't explain that.
<DecapKing> LOOK WHAT YOU STARTED FLUTTERBRO! LOOK WHAT YOU STARTED!
<Jason> prince-dari: Would you like to move to my network?? :D
<EspyLacopa> Phobos and Deimos.
<RobotPinkie> EspyLacopa: It's a Bill O'Reilly quote
<EspyLacopa> ...Who?
<AllisZero> 0Time for my WoW raid guys
*LordCelestia YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN ANYTHING. MUAHAHAHAH
<Jason> prince-dari: If you like, I can even run a bot that relays messages
<AllisZero> 0See you all in a few hours
<LordCelestia> go away trollestia nobody likes you
<Jason> between up to 5 networks
<FlutterBro> Yay! This RP is over! *black circle thing starts closing in!*
<EspyLacopa> Overlord Celestia?
<DecapKing> People play WoW? Can't explain that
<LordCelestia> *kills trollestia*
<prince-dari> XD not sure about moving again, we've moved around quite a bit recently.
<Rainbow_Dash> Why did the gunfire stop?
<RobotPinkie> Bill O'Reilly, American pundit.
<Jason> lol
<FlutterBro> RP IS OVER
<LordCelestia> BECAUSE THE MAGIC OF ANNOYING FRIENDSHIP OVERCAME MY EVIL SELF AND SET ME FREE
<Jason> Why, how do most peopel connect?
<LordCelestia> ...yay....
<FlutterBro> yay
<RDash> LordCelestia pronoun 1. any thing whatever; something, no matter what
<prince-dari> Mibbit.
<herospirit> ANNOYING, ANNOYING FRIENDSHIP
<RDash> Trololo-
<Jason> A great way to do it would be to shoot up a page, and then add the mibbit aplet there
<Jason> applet
<FlutterBro> New rp?
<DecapKing> BECAUSE OF AEIOU!
<LordCelestia> sure
<Jason> and that way, you can change anything through the backend, and your users will virtually never find out
<prince-dari> Yeah, we have a site up at the moment.
<FlutterBro> Lets try to be coherent this time.
<Jason> :O cool
<herospirit> Do we have to?
<FlutterBro> Where's an rp room?
<DecapKing> lets just spam the shit out of mane chat this time
<RobotPinkie> Really funny, he said the tide was unexplainable, and then when confronted with an explanation (the Moon), he asked why Mars doesn't have a moon. :P
<herospirit> Be coherent I mean.
<Jason> do you redirect the people to the mibbit site, or do you embed the mibbit iframe?
<prince-dari> We always have around 20+ people though, so the regulars tend to get annoyed that they have to refresh/clear cache, whatever.
<prince-dari> iframe
<Jason> oh
<FlutterBro> herospirit: I'd like to not do two random rps in a row
<herospirit> ...AEIOU
<Jason> I see
<RobotPinkie> Don't spam, post ponies!
<prince-dari> Then people with proper clients turn up in the old networks ages after we've moved.
<prince-dari> So it gets a bit tedius.
<Jason> what network you on?
<FlutterBro> I need somewhere to rp!
<LordCelestia> Mods are asleep
<LordCelestia> lol
<herospirit> Yah I know, I was joking FlutterBro :P
<DecapKing> AEIOU
<RDash> Mods asleep, post horses http://www.seattlemet.com/assets/0005/9043/horse-picture-brazil-a-velhaca-Eduardo-Amorim-horse-best-picture-gallery.jpg?1298060018

<RobotPinkie> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/328.jpg
<FlutterBro> Are there any good rp rooms in here?
<Jason> prince-dari: ^
<prince-dari> Currently irc.bronychat.net - but they're about to merge wih another network to be irc.ponychat.net (I think it's .net), there'll be something like 7 servers, so it should be able to hold the 1000+ people we'll be getting fine
<EspyLacopa> Is it a test of the emergency broadcast system?
<Rainbow_Dash> A test..?
<RDash> For science?
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: Does it involve unapproved medication?
<NewDCD> 9a test of our new possible mane stream
<Thunder_Dash> What kind of test?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 my body is ready DCD
<DecapKing> hey New DCD
<FlutterBro> oh okay
<LordCelestia> I take that back.
<DecapKing> guess whaty
<Jason> cool

<Jason> too
<Jason> but its ok
<EspyLacopa> Sure

<RobotPinkie> Not just my body, but a lot more is ready, NewDCD

<Aristeo> Just make sure you get a good linking structure set up
<Jason> like I do
<Jason> :D
<RDash> ValtheJean <sock puppets
<Jason> right, Aristeo?
<prince-dari> Sorry, I promised the guy who paid for all the servers that if I was fine with how his network ran we'd go there.
<Jason> nah, thats alright
*RainBroDash 10waves
<prince-dari> He paid for them because I agreed pretty much.
<EspyLacopa> Oh, what show is this?
<NewDCD> 9how is it running so far?

<EspyLacopa> Nice quality.
<RobotPinkie> No lag for me, really good stream
<EspyLacopa> Next, we need to do a stress test with live footage.
<NewDCD> 9Decap: you became Gundam?
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: Seems to stutter a bit for me…but that might just be my computer
<herospirit> What show is this?

<EspyLacopa> Giant robot fight!
<herospirit> Alright, thank you DCD :D
<LordCelestia> Good quality
<RobotPinkie> This seriously looks a lot better than regular stream
<ValtheJean> 2,14 to be fair, DCD is streaming :P
<LordCelestia> DOUA!!!!
<NewDCD> 9well that's because Sathi and Sprinks are still learning the ins and out of resolution adjustment
<GrimGallop> Where's this stream at? :O
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which means automatic +40 to stream rolls :P
<RobotPinkie> I mean regular DCD stream
<EspyLacopa> Just needs DCD with a shoe-hat.
<NewDCD> 9once they learn about that effectively, their streams will look a lot better
<RainBroDash> 10what's the URL of the stream?
<RobotPinkie> I never get this solid framerate with this little artifacting
<herospirit> That was an interesting application
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Rainbro: http://www.owncast.tv/channel.php?u=BronyState

<FlutterBro> lets get some streamception!
<NewDCD> 9let's go to phase two
<prince-dari> Typical DCD. :P
<FlutterBro> finally!
<DecapKing> mfw i dont know what that even means
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hmmm...I wouldn't know because I've never seen this episode :P
<prince-dari> >no one sees any problem
<RainBroDash> 10herospirit it's an old in-joke from when DCD started streaming himself irl XD
<RainBroDash> 10loong story
<prince-dari> >DCD: IT LOOKS HORRIBLE!

<RobotPinkie> owncast was VERY good though
<Thunder_Dash> ^
<LordCelestia> OHAI LOOK IM ON 2 CHATS
<SuperBrony64> Well look at that
<SuperBrony64> NO JOKE, I've been chosen!
<LordCelestia> LOOK IM COMING UP TWICE
<SuperBrony64> I've been selected to win an iPad
<Sumica> You must give them all of your info now.
<SuperBrony64> I'll give them my bank account info and social security number (that way they know it's me).
<SuperBrony64> Woah
<herospirit> Woh! How crazy! Me too superbrony!
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Thunder_Dash> Me too!
<SuperBrony64> So this is what the Matrix is like...
<Fluttershy> anyone else wanna join in? http://www.livestream.com/kimiart
<Jason> :3
<Aristeo> sure
<RobotPinkie> If someone offered to put you into something like the matrix to harvest your body heat, but the virtual world is Equestria and you are a pony.... would you do it?
<Thunder_Dash> Hmm...
<SuperBrony64> IT'S A GIRAFFE!
<Sumica> Would you remember?
<Thunder_Dash> Do I get to choose what kind of pony I am?
<RobotPinkie> Of course, Thunder_Dash
<Thunder_Dash> Then probably. :P
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Well.
<prince-dari> Actually.
<Flutteryay> I have a massive wingboner
<prince-dari> Being able to fly might be worth it.
<Flutteryay> therefore i am a pegasus
<RobotPinkie> also you'd forget everything about your human life, just like in The Matrix
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> Then no.
<prince-dari> I couldn't leave my family behind and just forget them.
<RobotPinkie> so if you got to remember, then it's fine, but not otherwise?
<RobotPinkie> Hmm, well this COULD be after Rainbow Dash saves everyone and gives them the choice
<RobotPinkie> So I guess you'd just be given the choice whether to remember or not?
<RobotPinkie> ...I don't remember the third movie all that well :P
<RobotPinkie> I'd be like prince-dari, if I had to forget the people I love then I couldn't do it.
<Thunder_Dash> They made sequels to The Matrix? *hit*
<Flutteryay> srsly, I've got the biggest wingboner
<prince-dari> Thunder_Dash: No they didn;t.
<prince-dari> The matrix has no sequels.
<RobotPinkie> lolol, Matrix fanboys
<ValtheJean> 2,14 for once, I agree with dari
<prince-dari> Actuall
<prince-dari> y
<RobotPinkie> Second movie was great :P
<prince-dari> The sequels are better than the first film
<Sumica> Prefered the animartix to the movies.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, fine by me. You're the one who has to pretend you like them :P
<prince-dari> Sumica: Wut
<Thunder_Dash> I've only actually seen the first one, I just couldn't help but make that joke :P
<prince-dari> What the fuck is the animatrix?
<RobotPinkie> Third... well... Trinity's 5 hour death scene kinda ruined it for me, because it was just that stupid...
<EspyLacopa> ....I can't get the shoo be doo song out of my head.
<Sumica> I take it you never saw it.
<prince-dari> The third film, oh God.
<prince-dari> "Why can he use his powers in the real world"
<Thunder_Dash> Espy; SHOO BE DOO SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
<prince-dari> "His powers extend beyond the matrix"
<prince-dari> FJAPOKFAWEOPKF
<ValtheJean> 2,14 MAGIC
<prince-dari> WHAT THE FUCK
<prince-dari> ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
<prince-dari> They just couldn't come up with anything good.
<prince-dari> So they gave us that bullshit.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 seriously...the movies would have been so much better if he had just ended up NOT being the one
<EspyLacopa> I only ever watched the first movie.
<prince-dari> I still think that the real world was a matrix too.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and they're just like "oh fuck"
<prince-dari> So the matrix was a matrix in a matrix, MATRIXCEPTION
<RobotPinkie> Well they didn't really extend beyond the Matrix, he could just still hack into it
<EspyLacopa> Mostly because it seemed like a given that Neo would just completely curb stomp further challenges what with being The One.
<Sumica> It was a bunch of short films Dari
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h5YmbhpI5c
<RobotPinkie> I saw all the Animatrix shorts
<RobotPinkie> Some were really good, others were pretty "meh"
<Silvermane> indeed
<Silvermane> "EVERYTHING IS A DOLLAR"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's like strip poker but with swords
<Fluttershy> -glomps Silvermane-
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fanservice much? jesus
<mib_ahrpdk> nuthing on?
<Sumica> first clip I found on YT val so not surprising.

<Silvermane> hello Fluttershy
<Barry> Hi
<Silvermane> lol
<Barry> 5+x-(7+7)=28 is x=37, right?
<Silvermane> didn't that article JUST get posted? and it's updated already?
<Silvermane> barry
<Silvermane> 5+x-14
<Silvermane> yes, 37
<Barry> I haven't taken algebra-level math in a while, so I'm a little rusty
<Silvermane> it's alright, Algebra was my favorite math by far
<prince-dari> Algebra is best maths.
<Silvermane> calculus 1 was a hell of a lot of fun too though
<RobotPinkie> ohay Barry
<Silvermane> was like learning a new language
<Aristeo> Hi Kitten :)
<Flutteryay> ...Vats has just happened
<WhatPayne> Oh Fluttershy stopped streaming?
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy stopped streaming, back to Canons
<Fluttershy> Yes because it's not streamcption sadly because streamception is not working but will do streamception some other time when have more energy and no cold
<Barry> Did you know that Nicholas Flamel was a real person?
<SuperBrony64> I don't understand, what exactly is Streamception?
<RobotPinkie> Aw, thanks for streaming, Fluttershy, and get well soon
<RobotPinkie> Streamception is a stream within a stream...
<SuperBrony64> Get better Fluttershy
<SuperBrony64> Oh I see, okay.
<Fluttershy> =_= Streamception will occur when main stream is up and running too sometime
<WhatPayne> A-Ha! I managed to block those Youtube ads that play a video before you can watch the actual video.
<LordCelestia> Fluttershy thanks for making that funny picture. It made my day!

<mib_28xl5a> i like raibow dash and i hope its soon the show is petty good
<mib_28xl5a> apple jack reminds me of me
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I think Applejack needs to be fleshed out a bit more.
<Hat> well i don't think we need to get violent
<mib_28xl5a> i think there all equally fleshed out right now if u asked me
<RobotPinkie> I mean Applebuck Season was great
<mib_28xl5a> i think so 2
<Wrek> 05hmm
<RobotPinkie> but still, in most other Applejack heavy episodes she's been in conflict somehow with one of the other ponies

<Hat> yes!
<mib_28xl5a> i guess ur right
<mib_28xl5a> because of this show i want to work on an apple orchard

<Silverscreen> 11Lookin' for a good replacement for mIRC. Any suggestions?
<LordCelestia> im very straight
<FreezeFrame> What OS?
<Hat> yes lol
<mib_28xl5a> lololololololol
<RobotPinkie> lawl, I think the percentage of straight to gay is pretty much the same with bronies as with other people.
<FreezeFrame> Windows 32, Windows 64, Linux, or OS X?
<Hat> sometimes my fedora gets a bit wonky though
<LordCelestia> In case ANYONE here doesnt know the MOON joke by now, watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
<Silverscreen> 11EVERYONE that's in BronyState know of that.
<Silverscreen> 11WE show it almost every other week.
<Hat> lol not me
<LordCelestia> lol awesome
<Apokalipse> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOON with you then
<Silverscreen> 11huh
<LordCelestia> but if the new domain is bronystate.net, does that mean this page is dead?
<Hat> insane celestia
<RobotPinkie> holy crap, I didn't know Daniel Ingram was a fan of NotACleverPony
<mib_28xl5a> okay im very commited to da show so give good things about mlp cuz dat was just racist to bronies. that vid
<Silverscreen> 11LordCelestia: lolidk
<SuperBrony64> Colloquy is a good application, I use it on my Mac.
<prince-dari> Holy shit.
<Hat> that's a traumatic video
<prince-dari> Skype just went insane on me.
<prince-dari> It's beeping crazily.
<RobotPinkie> Silverscreen: XChat is good. Why do you want to switch from mIRC?
<Silverscreen> 11SuperBrony64: > Uses a mac
<Silverscreen> 11I pity you.
<SuperBrony64> Ouch
<SuperBrony64> I pity you for NOT using a Mac.
<mib_28xl5a> leavin g2g
<FreezeFrame> What OS are you on, Silverscreen?
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Silverscreen> 11vista. =.=
<FreezeFrame> I'm sorry.
<Apokalipse> hahaha
<SuperBrony64> Ouch
<Hat> LordCelestia: it looks like the new domain just redirects here
<Apokalipse> I have XP and I think I'm better off
<FreezeFrame> Windows XP or 7 would be good.
<SuperBrony64> I pity you even more
<LordCelestia> Hey freezeframe
<RobotPinkie> lol, why not mIRC, Silverscreen?
<FreezeFrame> If you need 64 bit, 7
<Hat> bye mib_28xl5a
*FreezeFrame has paid-for mIRC, likes it.
<FreezeFrame> Yes, I paid for my mIRC
<Silverscreen> 11'cause I can't use color text on mIRC
<prince-dari> You PAID for mIRC?
<prince-dari> Wow.
<LordCelestia> FREEZEFRAME hi
<Silverscreen> 11or at least I don't know.
<prince-dari> Weird.
<Silverscreen> 11No, I didn't.
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, Colloquy doesn't just run on Mac, you can use it with Windows as well.
<LordCelestia> do you like bananas?
<Silverscreen> 11oh.
<LordCelestia> I sure like bananas
<FreezeFrame> prince-dari: I like to support programmers
<RobotPinkie> Well, have you tried XChat, Silverscreen?
<prince-dari> But...No one pays for mIRC. :P
<FreezeFrame> XChat I've heard good things about.
*FreezeFrame shrugs
<SuperBrony64> Oh wait, maybe it isn't...
<Silverscreen> 11I wish Mibbit would make their IRC usable off of websites...
<Silverscreen> 11Xchat?
<LordCelestia> fluttershrug
<SuperBrony64> Nvm, Colloquy doesn't work on Windows.
<FreezeFrame> mibbit is a web-client
<prince-dari> Yeah, most peopel seem to use Xchat now.
<prince-dari> people*
<FreezeFrame> On Linux, I used irssi
<Silverscreen> 11Chatzilla's kinda popular too.
<RobotPinkie> http://xchat.org/
<SuperBrony64> Have you tried Trillian Silverscreen?
*EspyLacopa uses KVIrc.
*Silverscreen 11has only been using mIRC.
<SuperBrony64> I used to use it all the time when I was on a Windows machine
<Silverscreen> 11That's all I've EVER used.
<Dashite> ^
<FreezeFrame> I've used bersirc, trillian, and pidgin before, too.
<SuperBrony64> It handles all kinds of messaging clients including IRC
<RobotPinkie> Yeah Chatzilla would work too, presumably...
<SuperBrony64> Here's a list of IRC clients: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5FIRC%5Fclients
<Silverscreen> 11XChat looks like an even Simpler version of mIRC.
<RobotPinkie> I used to use BitchX, but it got really awkward when people saw the shortcut :P
<Silverscreen> 11But would it let me post in color text like I'm doing now?
<Silverscreen> 11lol, RobotPinkie
<prince-dari> Or you could just make your own IRC client.
<prince-dari> Not very hard. XD
<Silverscreen> 11Coming from the code guru.
<Silverscreen> 11No thanks.
<RobotPinkie> Pretty sure you can use color codes in XChat just like in mIRC... I don't do it, though
<Silverscreen> 11oh? how do I do color codes?
<RobotPinkie> You can write a simple script to add color, otherwise.
<prince-dari> How do I shot colour?
<prince-dari> Ctrl + k
<Silverscreen> 11Well, I can set the interface to *look* different, but the text still comes up white on the other end.
<LordCelestia> Can i shot you to the moon?
<Silverscreen> 11HOLY SHIT IT WORKS!
<prince-dari> Lawl
*Silverscreen 11can use mIRC now. :D
<prince-dari> Good.
<prince-dari> :D
*prince-dari converts everyone to mIRC
<Bro> 11 Testing
<Bro> WHOO! \o/
<RobotPinkie> mIRC is for tomatoes
<SuperBrony64> 3Uh-oh, now I'm stuck using color :/
<RobotPinkie> lol don't do that, or you'll be kicked :P
<SuperBrony64> Nvm, fixed…I think...
<Bro> 11 Any Way to make this permanent? or do I just keep puting that code in?
<prince-dari> I can give you a script for it.
<Silverscreen> 11That'd be cool....but how do i put the script on mIRC? XD
<prince-dari> Script ediot.
<Barry> Hi silverscreen.
<prince-dari> Look at the buttons along the top/side of mIRC.
<Silverscreen> 11oh, I see it.
<LordCelestia> Hi Barry
<Silverscreen> 11Awesome.
<prince-dari> editor*
<Barry> Hi Lord Celestia.
<SuperBrony64> Colors are overrated anyway
<Barry> Seems the author of On A Cross And Arrow is considering a sequel
<LordCelestia> are you a faithful subject?
<Bro> I need colors to stick out as a mod in BronyState
<Barry> Depends, what happens tome if I'm not?
<Barry> to me*
<LordCelestia> well, i can offer you some bananas
<LordCelestia> lmao
<Barry> lol, nice one, Silverscreen
<LordCelestia> i wish the show wasn't named "My Little Pony" or named for little girls because then people wouldnt be ebmarassed to say they watch it in real life
<LordCelestia> imo
<Barry> I agree.
*Silverscreen 11googles for the script rather than waiting on Dari. :P
<prince-dari> Pfft.
<RDash> LordCelestia Yes, I did feel fine admitting that I like it in a spanish essay though
<prince-dari> Script written by me is 20% cooler.
<prince-dari> :P
<RDash> Mi Poni Pequeno
<prince-dari> But actually
<prince-dari> CBA to pastebin.
<prince-dari> You go google. :P
<Silverscreen> 11CBA?
<Calnos> Everyone is here a week early
<LordCelestia> i wonder what the teacher thought of you
<Calnos> I'm OK with this
<LordCelestia> lol
<RDash> LordCelestia I haven't given it to her yet :P
<LordCelestia> im just here to send unfaithful followers to the moon...
<LordCelestia> haha
<SuperBrony64> Silverscreen: Here's a color script I found online: http://www.ircbeginner.com/files/alkcolors.zip
<LordCelestia> well, not actually
<RDash> Although the other show I mentioned was How I Met Your Mother
<LordCelestia> but its fun saying MOOOOONNNNAH beeyetch
<RDash> That may distract her :P
<Rainbow_Dash> Wait. A sequel to On a Cross and an arrow?
<SuperBrony64> It can be loaded into the Alias section of mIRC
<LordCelestia> lol
<Rainbow_Dash> So much want
<LordCelestia> only one of my real life friends kows that I enjoy MLp

<RDash> Space is quiet
<RobotPinkie> In space, no one can hear your cool laser sound effects
*Silvermane Everypony, your attention for a moment please
*Nat_lq looks at Silvermane
<RobotPinkie> I seriously have problems watching sci-fi because of all the goddamn explosion sounds :(
*RDash stares unblinking at Silvermane
<Silvermane> As many of you know, today is the 10th Anniversary of a very dark day in our history. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cYgIPAghrLM/Tm06bjcvo5I/AAAAAAAAL9M/mPcMLLWS4Zw/s1600/56669+-+911+applejack+artist+contrail09+fire_fighter.jpg
<WhatPayne> (RobotPinkie: Watch Serenity)
<RDash> (Pic disappeared)
<RobotPinkie> (Okay, WhatPayne)
<Silvermane> If possible, I'd like those of you who are so willing to give a moment of silence for the friends, family, and heroes lost that day.
<Silvermane> http://miburl.com/WAkuPv
*LordCelestia "Everypony shutup
<FlutterBro> http://s902.photobucket.com/albums/ac223/CCXIII/Minecraft%20Bronies/?action=view&current=TwilightSparkle0.png
<FlutterBro> coolness
<LordCelestia> shhhhh
<Hat> nice!
<Hat> and the applejack one is a great painting
<Silvermane> Alright, thank you guys. I know not all of you felt the loss of that day. I was fortunate to not have any ties to the incident, but many were. We lost too many good men and women
*Nat_lq nods
*Dermathil waves to all in chat.
<Silvermane> Thanks. Gonna go grab a tissue now.
<WhatPayne> It was truly sad day even to watch it unfold
*Dermathil just came back from viewing Captain America, FINALLY
<Nat_lq> I had an uncle who worked there, but I never knew the guy and he took the day off.
<Silvermane> that is very fortunate timing
<Nat_lq> Yeah...
*LordCelestia I feel so sorry that the Earth dwellers have to go through so much violence and terror
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie in fact Serenity has done that space thing realistically, there is no sounds in space. And yet space battles can be really interesting.
<Silvermane> anyways. sorry to interrupt anything going on over here, just saw that Applejack image in the Drawfriend and it... made me remember that I wanted to do this
<Nat_lq> I understand.
<WhatPayne> No, we understand Silvermane
*Nat_lq hugs Silvermane
<RobotPinkie> That's alright, Silvermane. I may not have lost anyone that day, but I do have a lot of American friends. That day affected a lot of people very deeply.
<NewOCD> 9hey guys
<NewOCD> 9refresh your test streams
<NewOCD> 9and give me your opinions
<RobotPinkie> and WhatPayne, I really don't understand why completely disregarding the laws of physics would make a space battle more interesting. :P
*Silvermane hugs back
<Turgle> coooool watermark
<Dermathil> Who said Serenity?
<Dermathil> The Firefly show is something I got to see one day.
<Dermathil> NEWDCD
<Dermathil> what test stream?
<Zephirdd> NewOCD: where is the test stream? =p
<LordCelestia> I had nobody lost that day, but I still am really sad that it happened and it made me wanna jaba stake up the ass of terrorism
<Natleyn> DCD, nice watermark
<RDash> Dermathil http://www.dinkypage.com/bronystate-theaterlq
<Zephirdd> That day I was a child, so I got absolutely no emotions from that at the time
<RobotPinkie> and I like the model, FlutterBro, much nicer than other pony mods
<Turgle> i approve of the new watermark
<RDash> And he's gone...
<RDash> lol
<Zephirdd> but I feel sorry for those
<LordCelestiaLQ> Whatcha doin?
<Hat> hey, streamer! show us your C drive!!
<Hat> ;)
<Zephirdd> stream is fine for me
<RobotPinkie> stream not working for me, though... I see black.
<RobotPinkie> oh now it works
<Nat_lq> Oh god
<Zephirdd> lol sounds
<WhatPayne> Indeed. I really remember this scene from the show (and it's the only time I've seen anything like it in entertainment) where they have this fight scene where they shoot this other ship and only sound you hear is the echo of the sips own gun resonating in the hull. It's brilliant.
<Nat_lq> The stream is repeating skype boop forever
<Turgle> the quality is way better than the other stream
<Zephirdd> ^
<RDash> @bloopmeter Stream
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Stream is 49% bloop. (1666)
*Dermathil finds his interwebs be trolling him
<Hat> which show
<PrincessLuna> Hey! Big sister!
<RDash> Sounds right
<LordCelestia> YEs? little sis? haha
<Hat> ohnp
<Zephirdd> omg so many impostors
<Zephirdd> there is only one Luna
<Turgle> FLYINGJERRID.PNG
<PrincessLuna> you know how you control the sun and moon?
*Zephirdd hugs real Luna
<Rainbowshy> My stream is not working e.o
<PrincessLuna> im not imposing i just like Luna
<RobotPinkie> Nice, WhatPayne
*Hat puts socks on Luna
<Hero_Spirit> Blargblarg had to add an underscore
<LordCelestia> dont pick on my little sis
<Zephirdd> oh boy, I see where this is going
<NewOCD> 9Turgle
<Turgle> yep?
<NewOCD> 9isn't that a girl's name?
<PrincessLuna> Hey sister, can I control the moon again?
<Turgle> JERRID?
<LordCelestia> ..... i dont know about the moon
<LordCelestia> do u like bananas though?
<PrincessLuna> Oh...
<RobotPinkie> I can see where this is going....
<PrincessLuna> um... i dont know
<LordCelestia> well answer the question
<LordCelestia> do you like bananas
<PrincessLuna> oh god no
<PrincessLuna> im backing up now
<LordCelestia> so your a beeyetch who doesnt like bananas?
<NewOCD> 9refresh your test streams once more
<NewOCD> 9is that too big?
<NewOCD> 9or is it "just right"?
<PrincessLuna> oh god, please no
<Turgle> uhm
<Turgle> yes
*RobotPinkie puts Celestia in the moon cannon and fires her into the sun
<LordCelestia> well you can find out. ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAH
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie: FYI the show Firefly is really short (one season) so I recommend watching that. And after that watch the movie.
<PrincessLuna> NOOOOO
*LordCelestia launches luna to the moon
<NewOCD> 9I'll try moving it a bit more up
<Turgle> i think the wm is too big
<LordCelestia> BEEYETCH!!
<RobotPinkie> Serenity is a continuation of Firefly, then, WhatPayne?
<Zephirdd> NewOCD: the stream is right
<PrincessLuna> AAAAAaaaaaaahhhh
<WhatPayne> Yes
<RobotPinkie> I guess I'll have to, because that sounds really cool.
<Turgle> Zephirdd, check the watermark
<Zephirdd> Altough the site is q bit messed up
<Hat> don't worry, half the people in the chat are on the moon to keep you company
<Zephirdd> ooo the watermakr
<NewOCD> 9let's make it 25% smaller then
<Zephirdd> its a bit to the left
<RobotPinkie> You have no idea how much it irks me when space movies completely disregard physics :P
<Nat_lq> dat watermark
<Turgle> yay
<Zephirdd> imo stream should be widescreen, not 4:3
<Zephirdd> ;x
<Turgle> :D
<Turgle> 21:9
<Turgle> cinema format
<Zephirdd> actually
<Zephirdd> watermark is perfect
<RobotPinkie> I mean I'm fine with warp drive and teleportation
*PrincessLuna "Screw you sister im gonna start my own civilization here on the moon"
<NewOCD> 9Zephir, there's a reason it ISN'T widescreen
<NewOCD> 9you see
<NewOCD> 9when the stream source is 4:3
<LordCelestia> good luck witht hat
*PrincessLuna starts a moon civilization that grows and thrives more than Equestria
<LordCelestia> DAMMIT
<LordCelestia> ...
<NewOCD> 9the stream feed, should it be 16:9, will stretch the 4:3 feed
<PrincessLuna> hahaha
<NewOCD> 9on the other hand
<NewOCD> 9if the stream feed is 4:3 and we use a 16:9 feed
<NewOCD> 9I mean 16:9 source
<Turgle> shit happens
<NewOCD> 9the display is widescreen
<NewOCD> 9like so:
<Nat_lq> @Equestria's_populationmeter The new Lunar Colony's population
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The new Lunar Colony's population is 37% Equestria's_population. (1670)
<PrincessLuna> aw
<NewOCD> 9 4:3
<Hat> but ALL are devoted to the cause!
<PrincessLuna> but as of 2011 it is 150 percent
<LordCelestia> damn it Luna ur ruining equestria
<Hat> "from the moon!"
<Flutterdash> Anyone know how to fix the stream? It just says broadcast is offline e.o
<NewOCD> 9and 16:9

<LordCelestia> so you are a mmmm beeyetch that likes mmm bananas
<Hero_Spirit> I still can't stop thinking of ponies. My thoughts are now all in Pony form. What the fuck, guys.
<LordCelestia> (do you get this joke?)
<prince-dari> Hah, I'll bring him back later Rainbow_Dash.
<Rainbow_Dash> Aw.. Okay
<MrChang> well i think theres a place to know whether you think i like bananas or not.
<Dermathil> hey prince-dari

<LordCelestia> well, go. 'cause you about to go bananas
<LordCelestia> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOONNNNAAAAAAH

*LordCelestia launches MrChang to the moon
<MrChang> too loud
<LordCelestia> BEEYEETCH
<Rainbow_Dash> Seth? How quaint
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9phew
<NewDCD> 9I was getting some trouble on this end
<Rainbow_Dash> Speak for us words of wisdom Seth
<NewDCD> 9let's just say I got nervous
<prince-dari> DCD is about to stream.
<Dermathil> nice
<Dermathil> what is he gonna stream?
<prince-dari> I've updated the dinkypage, .co.cc, and .net.
<Dermathil> Some SRW Z2?
<NewDCD> 9Okay Seth
<TGnP_Natleyn> Ponies are bad at numbering guise.
<LordCelestia> Excellent. I shall not send him to the moon
<prince-dari> So any should work (you might need to close and reopen the pge if you've had it open for a while)
<NewDCD> 9I'd like to direct your attention to our stream window during this
<NewDCD> 9consider it a sample of our streaming capabilities
<NewDCD> 9starting...nwo.
<Hero_Spirit> Merry christmas, from Chiron Beta Prime! Where I'm working in a mine, for my Pony overlords. Did I say overlords? I meant protectors.
<NewDCD> 9*now
<LordCelestia> Damn right you meant protectors.
<LordCelestia> OBEY
<LordCelestia> .
<MrChang> dari it was #2 10m ago
<Dermathil> alright, gonna refresh
<Dermathil> MrChang, it was a typo by Cereal Velocity on EqD
<NewDCD> can you guys tell Seth about the publicity thing while I handle the stream?
<MrChang> i know
<Dermathil> it is #14
<MrChang> damn cereal velocity
<NewDCD> 9naw, we're just doing some stress tests
<NewDCD> 9actually fixed audio this time
<NewDCD> 9how is it?
<Sumica> looks good sounds good
<RainBroDash> 10Seeensaastionaal~
<Luna> 07it's amazing!
<MrChang> ONNNN THE MOOOOOONNNAHHH

<LordCelestia> *faints
<RainBroDash> 10dat extra s.. Bleugh, it's late

<Dermathil> Its working NewDCD
<MrChang> it still says offline
<RainBroDash> 10quality is looking goood DCD
<Hero_Spirit> POOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<LordCelestia> OMG LOOK IM ON THE STREAM LOOKIE THERE
<Natleyn> Back to being not so Great and Powerful.
<Dermathil> >mfw who be Seth?
<MrChang> how are you all seeing this?
<Sumica> http://www.dinkypage.com/bronystate-theaterlq
<Luna> 07nope
<Hero_Spirit> refresh the stream
<Natleyn> MrChang, refresh?
<Luna> 07bronystate.net/theatre
<Sumica> oh moved again.
<Natleyn> Yeah, normal stream has improved.
*Sumica is so out of the loop
<MrChang> it says offline for high quality
<Natleyn> OOH
<Natleyn> MY CURSOR IS SO ACCURATE. <3
<NewDCD> 9okay, I guess I'll be the one doing the talking
<RainBroDash> 10MrChang you gotta refresh the whole page, not just the stream
<LordCelestia> My stream looks and sounds fine here
<Natleyn> Try refreshing the page.
<Seth> Oh, i totally was digging through email
<Hero_Spirit> it's a little laggy for me for whatever reason
<NewDCD> 9well Seth, we wish to hold an event leading to Season 2
<NewDCD> 9(I mean the one talking for BronyState xD)
<Natleyn> I'm lagging a bit, but I assumed it was due to my brother playing 360
<NewDCD> 9anyways, we wish to hold a pretty hefty event
<Seth> Alright
<Natleyn> GENTLEMEN
<LordCelestia> and celestia
<NewDCD> 9you already know of our famous movie nights, which take place on Fridays
<LordCelestia> *cough*
<Seth> yep
<Natleyn> >Lord
<Natleyn> Right.
<MrChang> uhh
<NewDCD> 9since the premiere is next Saturday, this was our plan:
<MrChang> it still says offline for high quality
<MrChang> wahh
<Sumica> 5by5 here
<Seth> I missed whatever you streamed though
<LordCelestia> yep/
<Seth> Im watching megas right now apparently!
<LordCelestia> you...look...delicious
<NewDCD> 9Stream the movies from the movie night, then commence an overnight marathon of Season 1
<LordCelestia> GEMS
<NewDCD> 9Seth, I think you're in the wrong page LOL
<Hero_Spirit> yah, it lags for me.
<NewDCD> 9http://bronystate.net/theatre/
<NewDCD> 9there
<NewDCD> 9check that player out
<MrChang> high quality still says offline
*GrimGallop refreshes
<NewDCD> 9for a sample of our actual stream quality
<prince-dari> I'm not having any lag.
<LordCelestia> idk why all of your arent working, mines perfectly fine
<prince-dari> And as far as I've seen no one else has complained of any?
<GrimGallop> There we go, works for me~
<Luna> 07nope
*RainBroDash 10is now in modchat
<prince-dari> If you keep having problems, clear your cache then try again.
<Natleyn> Lag is gone.
<Hero_Spirit> Well you see Dari, I fail at life, and my stream apparently reacts accordingly.
<MrChang> no lag
<Seth> hmm, let me mess with scripts
<MrChang> but high quality says offline for me
<Nightshade> o hai MrChang
<prince-dari> Aww, Hero_Spirit.
<RainBroDash> 10hero_spirit, sounds pretty accurate ;)
<Sumica> there is no HQ atm
<NewDCD> 9anyways, we wanted to do Movie Night > Pony Marathon, leading to the S2 premiere...and after the premiere episode, we wished to follow it into non-pony related stuff, potentially including stuff like Doctor Who and House
<Swaffy_FromLiveStream> Prince Dari? Hey!
*VioletVanilla had one hesitation that lasted a few seconds.
<VioletVanilla> 6 but aside from that it is fine~
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanilla
<Sumica> then again if this is LQ i dont think I could handle HQ
<Natleyn> Hiya!
<prince-dari> Swaffy? Hey. o/
<Seth> Alright
<Seth> Sounds good!
<prince-dari> You found your way over here then. XD
<Nightshade> oh hey Swaffy it be SpaceBob
<Swaffy_FromLiveStream> Why are you guys here if there's no stream?
<NewDCD> 9in other words, a continuous stream starting on Friday Night and ending on Late Saturday
<prince-dari> There is a stream.
<NewDCD> 9well, here comes the pitch:
<Luna> 07there is a stream
<LordCelestia> to chat with fellow bronies
<MrChang> RAPEEEE
<RainBroDash> 10Swafft_fromlivestream there should be a stream. Refresh the page?
<Nightshade> im pretty sure this is a chat
<Swaffy_FromLiveStream> Hello SpaceBob.
<LordCelestia> NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<NewDCD> 9we saw how Bronyville cooperated with you for their S1 marathon recently
<VioletVanilla> 6SPIIIIKE! ugh, dirt. . . AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 9we were wondering what could we do to have our event have the same amount of exposure?
<Sumica> slight lag there after NOOOO
<NewDCD> 9we're thinking on elaborating a schedule for said event and publishing it so our viewers know what to expect at what times, and can be present for said programming
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<MrChang> yep
<Seth> hmm, we were planning that for a few months with them really. Brontville and EQD is really close
<LordCelestia> the clarity blurrs every few seconds by a very little bit
<Seth> bronyville^
<NewDCD> can you guys say something?
*Luna is watching fullscreen and enjoying it
<Hero_Spirit> tried refreshing, still lagging. I am SO BAD AT THIS
<NewDCD> I'm at my wits end
<Seth> I guess just toss the copypaste and I can roll with it, his was huge because he had like 30 awards hah
<Seth> the banner helped, but the way it was run was really built around making it exciting
<Natleyn> It goes a bit fuzzy in fullscreen, but otherwise it's nice.
<Seth> im not sure how much demand a second marathon would have right now after that
<prince-dari> Hero_Spirit: That probably means your DL speed is too low, DCD is streaming at epic high quality though.
<Seth> everyone is sort of burnt out
<LordCelestia> shes such a bad actor
<LordCelestia> lol
<NewDCD> 9Hero_Spirit, you probably should watch the Low Quality stream when it's set up
<NewDCD> 9dari
<Hero_Spirit> lag pretty much stopped for no reason now.
<Luna> 07Well it's not just a marathon, it's a full show
<NewDCD> 9I'm not streaming at epic HQ
<Luna> 07followed by the season 2 kick off
<NewDCD> 9I'm streaming at USUAL DCD SETTINGS
<RainBroDash> 10natelyn it's not really built for full screen at the moment, this is standard quality for the standard window
<Seth> Are you doing a podcast thing for it then?
<Hero_Spirit> I think my lag was just reminding me who the boss is
<Mitchthebrony> Rarity be the best pony
<RainBroDash> 10also I can't spell your name ever. Forgive me.
<Mitchthebrony> :C
<Natleyn> I figured, but they asked about FS before :<
<GrimGallop> Gotta love how the worst thing they can imagine for Rarity is a dirty room.
<prince-dari> DCD quality and epic high quality might as well be syonymous, your stream quality is always so nice. XD
<MrChang> they cant imagine rarity getting raped
<MrChang> its a kids show!
<Nightshade> not if prison gets hold of it
<Hero_Spirit> HOW DO THEY KNOW WHAT THE DOGS LOOK AND SOUND LIKE.
<NewDCD> 9(also, Seth, by any chance are you looking at the stream feed? We would like to know your opinion in our standard quality settings...not to mention we'll also host low-quality and mobile streams)
<Seth> It just depends on what your actual event is
<RainBroDash> 10wat do
<MrChang> what's prison
<Natleyn> >Spike has pockets
<MrChang> who's prison?
<LordCelestia> OMG
<prince-dari> [02:29] <Seth> Are you doing a podcast thing for it then?
<GGgala> how does Spike anticipate that the dogs have dogs?
<LordCelestia> MANLY SPIKE
<Hero_Spirit> Spike is pants
<prince-dari> Podcast.
<prince-dari> Gaaaaaaaaaaah.
<Seth> I've seen it before, its defenitly good enough!
<LordCelestia> @manlymeter Spike
<NewDCD> 9oh, we kind of....
<Seth> i mean we were watching cam quality stuff back in season 1
<Seth> so im sure any season 2 is good
<NewDCD> 9improved it, you see
<LordCelestia> oh its not doing that anymore
<LordCelestia> haha
<Natleyn> Steven is gone :(
<Hero_Spirit> and how do they know what the cave looks like!?
<NewDCD> 9my name might as well be NewOCD
<Seth> Probably even better than!
<Natleyn> Luna, did you ever download all those wallpapers?
<NewDCD> 9you can check it here as well http://www.owncast.tv/channel.php?u=Wild Dance of Machine God
<Seth> These things rarely work on my modified to hell browser though hah, i just report em
<VioletVanilla> 6inb4 sexy spike~ ;D
<NewDCD> 9http://www.owncast.tv/channel.php?u=WildDanceofMachineGod
<LordCelestia> GOIN IN FOR DA KILL
<Natleyn> Whoa there lover boy
<Hero_Spirit> Spike is THE playa playa
<LordCelestia> AW NEVERMIND
<Seth> But back to the event
<LordCelestia> i love this art
<Seth> It really all depends on what you guys have planned
<NewDCD> 9ah, I see
<Seth> are you just streaming episodes?
<LordCelestia> where every1 gets sucked in
<Natleyn> Pinkie! <3
<NewDCD> 9no, no
<LordCelestia> WEEEEEE!
<prince-dari> We need a podcast. :|
<Seth> Or are you doing a full on invite people/interview/podcast/livestream thing?
<LordCelestia> OMG look at pinkie lmao
<MrChang> this is why i love pinkie so much
<NewDCD> 9we're streaming two movies first (Brony Movie Night)
<Natleyn> SWAN DIVE
<NewDCD> 9that leads to the S1 episodes
<prince-dari> Shit.
<Mitchthebrony> lol SWAN DIVE
<RainBroDash> 10a podcast which is seperate to our usual schedule?
<NewDCD> 9which in turn leads to the S2 premiere
<LordCelestia> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
<Hero_Spirit> Wait, we're watching a Pony episode outside of Friday
<VioletVanilla> 6NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Mitchthebrony> that made my day!
<Hero_Spirit> WE MUST TELL NO ONE
<Natleyn> inb4intothebestnightofyourlife
<Mitchthebrony> anyone Mastur CHeef?
<Luna> 07RBD did you read about the marathon?
<NewDCD> 9which in turn leads to assorted non-pony show
<prince-dari> Seth seems pretty adamant about a podcast if we want to get plugged more than just getting a post.
<Natleyn> omg.
<Natleyn> omg guise
<NewDCD> 9which in turn leads to a rerun of last night's movie night
<Hero_Spirit> Wait, those gems are barely buried
<LordCelestia> HORSE PUSSY
<NewDCD> 9...which in turn leads to more non-pony material...which in turn leads to the rerun of the S2 premiere
<Seth> alright so it is just a marathon thing up until season 2?
<Hero_Spirit> The diamond dogs SUCK at this
<Natleyn> ^Shush!.
<Luna> 07Well.. i'm not sure about the partnership with the bronyshow.. a podcast might hurt our relationship with them
<RainBroDash> 10yeah, but I'm just flailing about in my head between having a podcast seperate from our marathon stuff, and having everybody chatting and involved and podcasting during the marathon
<Mitchthebrony> It doesnt make a bit of difference guys, Rarity's gone remember?
<Mitchthebrony> THe BALLS ARE INERT
<NewDCD> 9...which in turn leads to more non-pony stuff, finalizing with the two animated movies
<NewDCD> 9*ignore the the
<Natleyn> >w>
<LordCelestia> theyre fucking dogs they should dig it
<Natleyn> <3 Rarity
<KanyeNorthEast> i was hoping there would be more bowie references in this episode.
<NewDCD> 9it's kind of a pre-marathon and post-marathon thing, I'd say
<NewDCD> 9the stream might be live for....
<Seth> yep
<VioletVanilla> 6Okay. . .
<NewDCD> 9....around 32 hours or so
<VioletVanilla> 6Seems he wants special things. . .
<Mitchthebrony> How come rarity owns so much
<Mitchthebrony> lol
<Seth> I'm not really sure what all I could do for it though
<Luna> 07yep
<Seth> Bronyville was a special case
<KanyeNorthEast> not even "how could we get through this labyrinth of tunnels?"
<Natleyn> inb4whining
<Seth> they were interviewing people, and pulling the community in with drawings and stuff
<VioletVanilla> 6Maybe this is when we could showcase our guess that tune idea?
<VioletVanilla> 6And DA competitions?
<Seth> a plain marathon is something a lot of people have been doing all summer
<Seth> so its difficult to sell that as something fresh, especially when you are including non-pony to pony people
<RainBroDash> 10well we need to have one big solid event to be advertised
<VioletVanilla> 6Maybe have Wrek do some live srawing?
<RainBroDash> 10or I don't think he'll comit
<RainBroDash> 10commit*
<VioletVanilla> Well yes
<VioletVanilla> What I'm saying is. . .
<Seth> a lot of them don't have any interest in house, or older movies. I can see the swarms coming in for season 2 though
<VioletVanilla> The special part of the shows is what he is after, otherwise he says it is just normal marathon
<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<VioletVanilla> 6What we do is pitch these things included in it
<NewDCD> 9well, we have been thinking of making a podcast as well, but we wouldn't have it prepared for the event
<Hero_Spirit> She should draw an "X" on the largest support beam in the mine and run like hell.
<Natleyn> WHINING. <3
<NewDCD> 9hmmm...that said, we'd be elaborating a schedule for the event....do you think it could be visible in EqD?
<Natleyn> BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHINING
<NewDCD> we might as well cut our losses
<prince-dari> Well.
<Explosivo1> ANYTHING?
<NewDCD> let's just have him display our schedule
<prince-dari> Clearly we need to get on a podcast.
<Natleyn> Suddenly, ribbons
<LordCelestia> HIYA! ASS SMACKK!
<Seth> Yah I can post it up
<Seth> same as always
<RainBroDash> 10idd
<Natleyn> Suddenly, she enslaves her slavers
<prince-dari> >same as always
<Mitchthebrony> The moral of the story is, Whine to get what yah want
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Mitchthebrony> Right?
<Explosivo1> I agree
<Natleyn> Only works if you're shorter than three feet. :<
<FreezeFrame> It's that you can use your brains to overcome a physically superior opponent.
<LordCelestia> HIYA! ASS SMACK!
<Luna> 07I want to ask if other people / communities informed him about streaming season 2
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Natleyn> ;~;
<Suffuri> woopwoopwoop
<LordCelestia> did you.. just... smack my ass?
<NewDCD> 9okay, so, could we have a post, with the post image being our prepared schedule?
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Explosivo1> ;O
<NewDCD> do it.
<NewDCD> that said
*Natleyn hugs Rarity "You're not ugly!"
<Hero_Spirit> Then he's all like "DAMN STRAIGHT BITCH"
<Mitchthebrony> He just smacked my favorite Pony's flank
<Seth> Yah, as long as it's not too tall
<Mitchthebrony> :C
<NewDCD> I'll try to get us the most exposure possible
<NewDCD> 9roger that?
<NewDCD> 9*!
<Hero_Spirit> DD has a weak ass pimp hand
<VioletVanilla> 6.-. Did. . . no one see my suggestions. . ?
<LordCelestia> Ill tell you where they can't smack Rarity
<Luna> 07Seth, i'm just curious did any other communities inform you about themselves streaming Season 2?
<LordCelestia> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAH
*LordCelestia Send Diamond Dogs to the Moon
<Natleyn> BEE-YETCH
<LordCelestia> BEEEYEEETCHES
<NewDCD> Vio
<Explosivo1> RIDE
<NewDCD> we can't prepare those things in a week
<Suffuri> woop
<RainBroDash> 10we did, but I don't think mentioning untested ideas is a redeemable quality, I think we need to stick to what we've got so far
<LordCelestia> fuck em up
<LordCelestia> fuck em down
<VioletVanilla> 6>Livestream Wrek's art.
<Seth> no set communities, just random people on livestream/justintv
<Mitchthebrony> haha is that a regular show ref?
<VioletVanilla> 6Done before.
<Seth> but if you can handle the traffic i'll send people here instead
<Suffuri> are there gems on the moon?
<NewDCD> as a drawfag
<Hero_Spirit> These Dogs go down like bitches
<Natleyn> Nope.
<NewDCD> I can tell you
<Natleyn> Hiya Suffuri!
<NewDCD> people barely, if ever, stick for drawing streams
<Mitchthebrony> There sure is a bunch of stuff on the moon
<Luna> 07should we tell him about our second stress test?
<NewDCD> we might as well stream a marathon of House
<Hero_Spirit> Seriously. Diamond Dogs < Cannon fodder
<NewDCD> yes, but I'm going to try to ask him something
<Luna> 07ok
<Suffuri> allo.
<Luna> 07i'll wait
<NewDCD> give me a moment
<prince-dari> The IRC is set up for at least a few thousand people, and we have no viewer limit on our stream, so it should be all good.
<NewDCD> 9additionally we're setting a room system so that the chat can still be enjoyable and not insane
<prince-dari> Hmm
<NewDCD> 9also Seth I have a question
<VioletVanilla> 6People stick around for Fluttershy's streamception. . .
<prince-dari> I'm not sure about the second stress test.
<Suffuri> ... people really seem opposed to free shit this week.
<prince-dari> It seems to be askign a bit much.
<Luna> 07they do yes
<NewDCD> 9you always have this red text under the selection buttons
<prince-dari> What with getting a post on Friday as well.
<Natleyn> Good thing they're not Lannisters.
<prince-dari> asking*
<NewDCD> 9that links to noteworthy posts
<MrChang> damn lannisters
<NewDCD> 9will you be linking to streams using that method?
<Natleyn> Goddamn Joffrey.
<LordCelestia> oh come on lethim finish that one
<MrChang> i want ned stark back!
<Seth> I could!
<NewDCD> 9as in, to posts advertising S2 streams, I mean
<Explosivo1> >i agree
<LordCelestia> PLAY ANOTHER :D
<MrChang> sean bean is my favorite guy there
<Seth> Though I used to just have a post with a list of streams in the morning when it aired
<LordCelestia> play the one with luna
<Hero_Spirit> They already had the ropes on the Ponies' snouts! If they had pulled a little harder they could have broken them!
<LordCelestia> (episode 2)
<Natleyn> GIVE US SANSA BACK SO SHE CAN FADE INTO THE BACKGROUND
<Hero_Spirit> DIAMOND DOGS ARE HORRIBLE AT EVERYTHING
<LordCelestia> play episode 2 please
<Sumica> What makes you say that Suffruni? No one wants your steam giveaways?
<NewDCD> 9well if you could link to our stream post with that, it'd be pretty rad O:
<Luna> 07lol LordCelestia
<NewDCD> there
<VioletVanilla> 6Good job DCD. . .
<MrChang> my favs
<MrChang> sean bean
<Explosivo1> Now which one?
<NewDCD> that's the most we can possibly get out of him...and frankly I believe that's pretty good.
<MrChang> and tyrion
<LordCelestia> i love Luna (no lesbianism intended)
<LordCelestia> :D
*Natleyn hugs Luna
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Luna> 07yea.. but we do need to look at our show... we lack communication with our community
*MrChang gobbles
<prince-dari> I'd rather not ask him for another post for a stress test.
<NewDCD> hmmm
<prince-dari> That'd be asking for a bit too much imo.
<Seth> yah i can do that
<RainBroDash> 10Do you think there's any chance we could get him at some point to just mention before saturday that we'll be streaming s2 live?
<Hero_Spirit> I'm still angry with the diamond dogs for being horrible fighters.
<NewDCD> how about we ask ponychan to attend our stress test?
*Luna hugs Natleyn
<Hero_Spirit> :I
<Seth> but im sure there will be a few marathons leading up to season 2
<Seth> so i might have to compile them
<Luna> 07Poke Hip
<Luna> 07i'm sure he can pull some strings
*MrChang im sure they weigh 3x more than the ponies
<RainBroDash> 10as a non- Brony Movie Night post, just to say 'Go to these guys for poni on saturday!'
<Seth> the actual stream of season 2 episode one though I will link
<MrChang> oops
<Explosivo1> so how could the ponies support them?
<RainBroDash> 10a nice succinct post or something
<NewDCD> 9well that'd be pretty rad
<Hero_Spirit> Yah, and their arms look like small tree trunks
<MrChang> they're freakishly strong
<Seth> but I know most of the synchtube channels will be doing stuff on that day too
<MrChang> they are the elements of harmony
<MrChang> they don't give a fuck
<Hero_Spirit> But the diamond dogs hardly even tried. They just suck SO BAD.
<Natleyn> I choose option 3
<LordCelestia> theyre manging mutts
<NewDCD> 9well, the problem with synchtube, in my opinion as a seasoned streamer, is that it's just a stream, and not a LIVE stream
<Natleyn> Elements of Harmony don't give a fuck
<MrChang> ME GUSTA
<Hero_Spirit> Diamond Dogs are the worst kind of cannon fodder.
<Luna> 07live-stream > synchtube
<LordCelestia> I am disgraced that they even exist in my kingdom
<MrChang> since when did equestria get internet?
<Seth> yah
<NewDCD> 9as long as it gets across that we're streaming S2E01, everything is bright~
<Luna> 07internet?
<Seth> thats why i'd point people here for the actual episode
<Natleyn> Anyway
<Seth> it will
<NewDCD> 9also Seth
<NewDCD> 9do you have The Hub?
<MrChang> are we channeling streams through horns?
<NewDCD> 9ah! Yes! That reminds me
<Seth> but marathonwise im pretty sure a bunch of people wil be doing that, so it will be harder to get exclusivity on that.
<Natleyn> Woona, did you ever download those wallpapers?
<Seth> Yah I do
<LordCelestia> Cannon fodder is an informal, derogatory term for military personnel who are regarded or treated as expendable in the face of enemy fire. The term is generally used in situations where soldiers are forced to deliberately fight against hopeless odds (with the foreknowledge that they will suffer extremely high casualties) in an effort to achieve a strategic goa
<KanyeNorthEast> all I see is darkness
<LordCelestia> *goal
<NewDCD> 9our stream will also have another feed, which will be compatible with Mobile Phone's uStream App
<Luna> 07I'ts beautiful
<Luna> 07it's*
<NewDCD> 9ergo Android Phone/Tables, iPhones/iPads and Windows Phones can watch the episode live as well
<Natleyn> <3
<MrChang> can we stream 1 more ep?
<LordCelestia> Luna and i don't need computers. We use our magic to make magic... screen... things.... whatever we just can, okay?
<Luna> 07indeed
<DecapKing> Hey Luna
<MrChang> ok, princess
<MrChang> but
<NewDCD> 9the information to our mobile stream can be somewhere noticeable in our stream, right?
<Suffuri> Yeah Sumica, basically that in a nutshell.
<MrChang> what about the rest of us other ponies?
<Luna> 07We need no ring, no weapons, no nothing... just MAGIC
<LordCelestia> all the way sis
<LordCelestia> *sishoof*
<Hero_Spirit> Also the Diamond Dogs had spears. They never used them. WHAT THE HELL DIAMOND DOGS
<Luna> 07We will discuss our current show with the rest of the team. There may come some changes in the near future.. We will keep you posted.
<MrChang> i hope you two burn in a fire
<LordCelestia> Youre pushin your luck before ur sent to the moon, MrChang
<MrChang> monarchs always thinking they're better than us
<DecapKing> I prefer killing my enemies with nuclear hellfire that sears their flesh and turns their bones into piles of ashes
<NewDCD> 9*in our stream
*Luna hugs LordCelestia
<NewDCD> 9I meant in our post derp
<MrChang> time for a pony revolution!!!
*LordCelestia hugs Luna :D
<KanyeNorthEast> all they do is hide behind trees and poach
<NewDCD> well
<Seth> If you include it it will!
<Hero_Spirit> Nukes are for pansies. :I
<DecapKing> Ill get the nuke cannon...
<NewDCD> our S1 Marathon will probably not get much exposure
<LordCelestia> brb guys
<MrChang> while the princess is gone
<NewDCD> but the post-show of the S2 premiere WILL
<MrChang> attack canterlot full force!
<RainBroDash> 10I think we've got as much out of him as we could have, given our current situation
<Luna> 07As long as the S2 kick-off will i'm all good
<MrChang> grab the apple pies!
<NewDCD> yeah
<RainBroDash> 10great job DCD btw

<Luna> 07yep
<Luna> 07it only needs to be changed on our about page
<Luna> 07then my transformation is complete!
<Luna> 07lol
<RainBroDash> 10also, Hipster is still on the about page, not sure if that's intentional, orr

<MrChang> pinkie is infinitely better
<Luna> 07i'm in the steamgroup
<Luna> 07what about it?
<Seth> Yep np
<NewDCD> 9in any case, when it comes to streaming, we're S-Rank Specialists, so if you need to refer someone if they need streamers or a stream teacher, well, make sure to refer to us.
<KanyeNorthEast> theres a steamgroup?
<Seth> Alrighty!
<Luna> 07Yes there is
<Seth> I'm sure you will be flooded though
<Seth> people will defenitly go for a direct hub stream over a cam hah
<Suffuri> lack of people in it, would like more than 4 people for a contest, so i figure i'd also enter people who commented on the main page (Bronystate) for last weeks.
<Luna> 07Most likely yes!
<NewDCD> 9believe me mon garçon...we're ready for the heat. We've been preparing since the end of S1
<Luna> 07i'm signing up now!
<KanyeNorthEast> its called bronystate right?
<NewDCD> 9this is the test by fire
<LordCelestia> im back
<NewDCD> 9and believe me
<NewDCD> 9we're a hot-blooded bunch

<Octavia> 13Seth thinks its a good idea too probably. A good podcast really brings people in sometimes. :P
<Sumica> Feh the Hub guide says the same as my cable guide luna.
<MrChang> and i don't have cable anymore
<KanyeNorthEast> has anyone ever tried to figure out about how many bronies there are?
<Luna> 07I lost count KanyeNorthEast
<MrChang> we've a lot of bronies and fillies
<Natleyn> Enough to populate Equestria.
<Octavia> 13Also, I dunno if I should feel bad or not, buuutttt...
<KanyeNorthEast> i'm sure there will be a lot more with season 2 starting
<Sumica> I tryed counting one but then Dash got mad cause I messed up her count.
*DecapKing glomps Octavia
<Luna> 07hahah
<Luna> 07dat Dash
<Octavia> 13I... don't like Synros as a mod still. >.>;

<KanyeNorthEast> you're going to be 4 Filipino men?

<Kencolt> Ah, which is why I can't tell.
<Octavia> 13Ah, was wondering why my stream was perpetually loading.. lol
<Natleyn> Can anypony help me find a picture of Twilight casting magic that isn't the huge burst from the Trixie Episode? >.>
<Fourze> I got great news everypony

<Luna> 07post pics of Pinkie if you see her!
<Sumica> Try earlyer in the same ep Natleyn
<Luna> 07She likes to roam around there I heard!
<Kencolt> Perhaps we should just... Oh, that is... great. I guess. IN a paying way. \
<KanyeNorthEast> actually street fighter: the movie would be an awesome B movie for this stream
<Fourze> which means ill be seeing matt hill at an anime con
*Octavia 13now has the idea of going as Pinkamena for Halloween
<Natleyn> I don't want to actually load up the episodes, but... whatever. </lazy>
<Fourze> and im gonna be bringing him a big apple pie
<Natleyn> 'Tavi: DO EET
<Octavia> 13;)
<Kencolt> it does have one of the greatest B-movie lines ever, Kanye.
<KanyeNorthEast> world domination?
<KanyeNorthEast> Of course!
<Kencolt> no...
<LordCelestia> Hey guys I'm back for a little bit
<KanyeNorthEast> or do you mean "for me it was tuesday"?
<MrChang> http://images.cosplay.com/photos/12/1291975.jpg'
<MrChang> that is gdlk
<Kencolt> "For me... it was Yueday."
<MrChang> look at that beauty, luna
<LordCelestia> MrChang whats up
<Kencolt> Tueday-- argh.
<DecapKing> DO IT OCTAVIA!
<Natleyn> Welcome back, LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> Hey guys I have something to show you: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/Lord-Celestia-257993873
<Sumica> Do it Octavia, personaly I am gonna try a crying angel.
<Natleyn> Why black, though?
<MrChang> whys he black
<MrChang> and why does he still look like a filly
<KanyeNorthEast> a crying angel? as long as you're not weeping...
<Kencolt> Face it- most colts look like fillies anyhow.
<LordCelestia> :D
<MrChang> and he looks very, very young
<Sumica> Crying weeping meh.
<KanyeNorthEast> otherwise i'll just stand back here not blinking
<Sumica> You know what i meen.
<LordCelestia> Black because, idk it seems more manly
<LordCelestia> and hes not a filly
<LordCelestia> ?
<LordCelestia> hes too tall
<MrChang> he looks like a female..
<MrChang> there's no colt in him
<KanyeNorthEast> the male ponies have very specifically shaped heads
<Natleyn> His body is female >.>
<Sumica> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/228/a/a/metal_gear_woona_boss_fight_by_egophiliac-d46qxbw.png
<Hero_Spirit> The shape of his head is Colt like.
<MrChang> and her husband would look more of celestia's age
<MrChang> he looks like her teenage son
<Hero_Spirit> That's usually where the difference is.
<Natleyn> Sumica: <3
<LordCelestia> The bodies are generally the same i thought?
<Natleyn> Also HHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGG
<MrChang> yeahhhhhhhhh no
<Kencolt> Teenage Celestia's son. Fic in there somewhere...
<Natleyn> Colts and Stallions have thicker bodies.
<KanyeNorthEast> metal gear pony
<MrChang> take big mac for instance
<MrChang> now THATS a colt
<Natleyn> It's really minor, but it makes all the difference.
<LordCelestia> Be right back then...
<Luna> 07http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/253/1/8/luna_the_bunny_by_europamaxima-d49grvf.jpg
<Kencolt> OK. So he's a BISHONEN colt.
<LordCelestia> ill go fix it, itll take 2 secs
<MrChang> big mac is fucking jacked
<Luna> 07don't share with anyone!
<Natleyn> Luna: D'awwww
<Luna> 07You won't see me in it again EVER!
<Kencolt> Be a major popularity with the mares in Neighpon. Swooning.
<KanyeNorthEast> that was luna 20 minutes before she became nmm
<Sumica> Luna you look like you are ready to kill some one.
<Octavia> 13Dat Luna in a rabbit costume <3
<MrChang> that was luna before she was SENT TO THE MOOOOOONNNNNNAAAAHHHH
*Octavia 13is reminded of A Christmas Story
<Luna> 07It was Trollestia was it?!
<KanyeNorthEast> eternal night? you'll put your eye out
<Octavia> 13^
<Kencolt> Be polite to the Mistress of the Moon. Or I might start biting.
<MrChang> man nobody likes the moon
<Natleyn> 'Tavi bites :3
<DecapKing> And i shall start doing what I do best
<KanyeNorthEast> remember to drink your ovaltine, man I love that movie
<Natleyn> CHANG SHUSH BEFORE I GET OUT MAH PIMP SLAPPIN RING
*Luna is trying to find out who did it!
<Natleyn> It has a +9 strength enchantement :3
<Octavia> 13Haha, indeed KanyeNorthEast, I do too :D
<MrChang> you cant wear it
<MrChang> everypony has hooves
<MrChang> no fingers
<MrChang> so HAH
<LordCelestia> Dammit trollestia i told you to stay away
<KanyeNorthEast> the one movie I desperately want to see streamed is kung fu hustle
<DecapKing> I actually think that it was Silvermane that did it Luna, he wants you to become Nightmare Moon for some reason
<Kencolt> Being a wolf, I have a small advantage there...
<KanyeNorthEast> hardly anyone i've talked to has ever seen it
<Natleyn> >_>
<Natleyn> Fine.
<Natleyn> I'll go get my Cuirass of Strength +17.
<Luna> 07Mmmm...
<MrChang> yeah?
*Luna takes notes
<MrChang> deflect check
<MrChang> i rolled a 20!
<MrChang> eat it.
<Natleyn> I rolled a 20 too!
<Natleyn> Roll again.
<KanyeNorthEast> i cast magic missile at the darkness!
<MrChang> i rolled a 60!
<Kencolt> IT'S A GAZEBO!
<Natleyn> You're breaking the game and disqualified. :<
<MrChang> 100sided die
<MrChang> I AM THE DUNGEON MASTER!!!!
<Natleyn> ... I actually rolled a 20
<Natleyn> >what
<MrChang> you don't have a 100 sided die?
<MrChang> why..?
<Natleyn> It's not used in most games.
<MrChang> DM
<MrChang> derp
*Kencolt only rolls his eyes. Even raised by ponies, sometimes he doesn't get them...
<Sumica> I prefer to use the cluexfour.
<KanyeNorthEast> hey guys, i just made up this sweet original character. she's actually the other surviving time lord and also an uchiha and she's beautiful and perfect and everyone should love her. Don't worry, i've put in some realistic flaws.
<Natleyn> Kanye: Best be trollin'
<Natleyn> But I know you are. ^_^
<DecapKing> Dont worry Kencolt, as a Stalliongrad pony I dont get these Ponyville ponies at all
<Kencolt> At least you have some common instincts... grrrr.
*MrChang begins to unsheath Masterwork Iron Sword +5
<KanyeNorthEast> she's also got a sonic cellphone, way better than some stupid screwdriver
<DecapKing> No, not that many
<DecapKing> Only 1 or 2
<MrChang> uchiha..
<MrChang> are you referencing naruto?
<Barry> Apparently, you burn more calories watching an hour-long soap opera than you do watching a three hour baseball game.
<Hero_Spirit> I am back and KANYENORTHEAST DID YOU SAY KUNG FU HUSTLE.
<MrChang> and you're combining it with doctor who?
<KanyeNorthEast> yes, common mary sue tropes
<KanyeNorthEast> yeah, kung fu hustle is awesome
<Hero_Spirit> BROHOOF KANYE. RIGHT NOW.
<Natleyn> KUNG FU HUSTLE IS AMAZING
*Silvermane is confused. "What did I do? The bunny outfit?"
<KanyeNorthEast> -brohoof-
<DecapKing> eeeyup Silvermane
<MrChang> kung fu hustle is made by my people.
*Hero_Spirit brohoofs Kanye and Nat
<MrChang> you're welcome, everypony
<KanyeNorthEast> i wish I could find more people around me who've even heard of it
<LordCelestia> Guys, I fixed my picture
<Hero_Spirit> Have you seen Kung Pow?
<Silvermane> Luna, I swear, i don't really like bunnies all that much. (however, I DID give you that pair of socks...)
*Natleyn brohoofs Hero_Spirit
<LordCelestia> it more acturately captures my manlyness
<LordCelestia> http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/Lord-Celestia-257993873
<Kencolt> No. He's referencing Strawberry Shortcake.
<KanyeNorthEast> of course i've seen kung pow, its also amazing
<Hero_Spirit> :D
<DecapKing> No Silvermane, you wanted her to transform into NMM
<Natleyn> Lord: Now you've got it
<Silvermane> oooohhh
<MrChang> change his color scheme and hair
<Natleyn> It's like Blueblood
<Hero_Spirit> Maybe a little TOO manly
<Hero_Spirit> :p
<Natleyn> If he wasn't a douche and was built out
<LordCelestia> you can never be too manly
<KanyeNorthEast> I think Kung Fu Hustle is serious A movie material, if only i'd win the lottery
<Silvermane> DecapKing, I love Luna, but NMM is just so...
<MrChang> and extend his face.
<Fluttershy> Luna! <3
<Luna> 07SILVERMANE!
<LordCelestia> Luna!
*Luna is angry
<KanyeNorthEast> B movie would be office space
<Kencolt> Face it-- a male version of the Sun Princess is gonna be on the Bishie side.
<Hero_Spirit> It's kinda hard to say if it's B or A.
<MrChang> no
<DecapKing> And my work is done here.....
<MrChang> you can make him manly
<Luna> 07Did you.... put me in a bunny - outfit ?!?!?!
<MrChang> give him a beard
<KanyeNorthEast> apart from the dubbing its pretty high quality stuff
<Hero_Spirit> actually I'd say B.
<KanyeNorthEast> its just relatively obscure
<MrChang> and hair like big mac but make it brown
<LordCelestia> Hey, Luna! I've taken a picture to capture my manliness
<LordCelestia> http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/Lord-Celestia-257993873
<Hero_Spirit> It's B, as a cult classic.
<Fluttershy> Um... Luna...? >3>;
<KanyeNorthEast> fair enough
*Natleyn hugs Fluttershy
<MrChang> extend his face too, it's disproportionate to his body
<KanyeNorthEast> theres so many great movies that are B material
<Hero_Spirit> Has anyone here seen "Murder by Death"?
<Sumica> Fluttershy, RUN
<LordCelestia> Extend... his face?
*Fluttershy is hugged, squeaks. "B-But I can't move... I'm being hugged!"
<LordCelestia> i dont think i had that option
<Kencolt> If it's any consolation, my lady-- I do think you look better in it than your sister would. You have some remaining degree of, well... cuteness-- where your elder co-Alpha would just look... well... silly.
<LordCelestia> GROUP HUG AROUND FLUTTERSHY EVERYPONY
<FreezeFrame> Okay, time to sleep soon
<MrChang> you gotta extend it
*LordCelestia hugs Fluttershy too
*Natleyn releases Fluttershy
*LordCelestia hugs fluttershy again
<MrChang> give him a beard
*DecapKing gently hugs Fluttershy
<Hero_Spirit> ....NO ONE ELSE has seen "Murder by Death"? :[
<MrChang> and give him big mac's hair
<KanyeNorthEast> how are you guys doing that anyway? is it /me or something?
<MrChang> make the horn longer
<LordCelestia> GROOUP HUG AROUND FLUTTERSHY
<MrChang> change the color scheme
<Sumica> yeah KanyeNorthEast
*Hero_Spirit group hugs
*KanyeNorthEast is amazing
*Fluttershy is bombarded by hugs. "Ahhhhh!!! Silvermane I---blaraghgh...."
<Silvermane> LUNA
<KanyeNorthEast> oh hey, it works
<DecapKing> Calm down on hugging Fluttershy, she is fragile
*Silvermane rescues Fluttershy
<LordCelestia> He wouldnt be celestia without the long hair
<LordCelestia> and i dont have the option of longer face and horn
<Silvermane> Luna, I swear i did not put you in that bunny outfit
<KanyeNorthEast> so is it suppose to be rule 63 celestia?
*MrChang hugs Fluttershy with thorn armor
*Dermathil leaves
<KanyeNorthEast> or mr.celestia, the husband
<Kencolt> Yes.. the msne must needs be long...
*Luna sighs relieved
<NewDCD> I don't mind having him in the mod team. He's qualified, but...well, yeah, what always scared me was the fact that he would lose his passion after hipster left
*Fluttershy is hugged by MrChang [and because it's after she was rescued it counts], proceeds to scream and bleed-
<NewDCD> we should ask him if he still wants to mod for us
<Fluttershy> e-e; OUUUUUUCHHHHH stop pricking meee! ><
<LordCelestia> OH NOES.
<Hero_Spirit> You guys need to see Murder by Death. It's another Genre Parody.
*DecapKing stabs MrChang in the head
*LordCelestia Heals fluttershy with magic
<Luna> 07We already did
<LordCelestia> +50
<KanyeNorthEast> I haven't really seen that but i've seen Clue
*MrChang rolls 20 on dodge check
<KanyeNorthEast> the movie based on the boardgame
<MrChang> HA HA
<Fluttershy> Luna Luna Luna Luna~
<LordCelestia> Take a message please
<Hero_Spirit> If I remember right Clue was a great movie
<KanyeNorthEast> it was, its been so long since i've seen it
*Kencolt sighs... and howls at Luna, just because. It's the right thing to do.
<Sumica> Poor Fluttershy geting loved to death.
<KanyeNorthEast> its always nice to see someone who appreciates movies
*LordCelestia says "Alright, who should I send to the moon as my LAST victim of the night?"
*Sumica goes back to eating popcorn.
<Natleyn> OOH MEE MEEEEE
*Natleyn jumps around excitedly
<Luna> 07Fluttershy?
<NewDCD> what he say
<KanyeNorthEast> Fight Club would make a good A movie too
*Fluttershy is loved to death x-x
<KanyeNorthEast> though i'm sure everypony has seen it already...
<Hero_Spirit> Murder by Death was a clue like movie. Bunch of strangers invited to a house, someone's murdered, they all try to figure out who it is.
<LordCelestia> Natleyn, do you like bananas?
<Octavia> 13Has he even been around lately?
*Luna casts a protective spell to protect Fluttershy
<Natleyn> I like bananas o-o
<Sumica> If we were gonna watch a clue like movie how about we just watch Clue.
<LordCelestia> So lemme clarify. You are a beeyeetch that likes mmm bananas
<Natleyn> MrChang, its generally a reflex roll. Just fyi.
<Natleyn> Uhh, yeah, but I don't see what that has to do....
<Natleyn> ... with... anything
<Natleyn> ?
*LordCelestia prepares canon
<LordCelestia> Good 'cause you about to go bananas
<LordCelestia> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAH
<Natleyn> OH NO
*Sumica bounces popcorn off the protective shell.
<Natleyn> OH GOD
*LordCelestia launched Natleyn to moon
<LordCelestia> BEEEEYEEEETTCCHHH!
*Natleyn is 100% moon.
<LordCelestia> *Maniacal laughter
*Fluttershy blinks, then smiles at Luna. "Thanks!" Fluttershy then proceeds to hug Luna.
*Kencolt stares at the screen. This spinning circular thing is getting interesting.
<LordCelestia> Aw, more group hugs!
<Hero_Spirit> Guys, why does Italy get such a great MLP FIM theme? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trf002vigUA
*LordCelestia rushes over and squeezes both Luna and Fluttershy
<LordCelestia> come on everypony
<LordCelestia> hugs :D
<KanyeNorthEast> that is ridiculous, why is italy so awesome?
*Hero_Spirit sniffs LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> Im an italian stallion :D
<Hero_Spirit> that's how I say hellow.
*LordCelestia "Ummmmmm"
<LordCelestia> hi
<Hero_Spirit> HEEEELLLLLOOOOOWWWWWWW.
<KanyeNorthEast> you're a bum and you fight like an ape
<LordCelestia> seeing apes are 10 times stronger than humans
*Kencolt sighs, and joins the hug-- it's not wolflike, but was raised by ponies, so...
<Hero_Spirit> I can't stop listening to the Italian theme.
<LordCelestia> that is fairly good
<Octavia> 13Oh, a question also popped into my mind.
<Fluttershy> "I like bananas." >>
<LordCelestia> Oh you do?
<KanyeNorthEast> >.> i was following up your reference
<LordCelestia> Would you like to find out where else you can find bananas?
*Luna hugs Fluttershy whispering: "your welcome dear"
*Natleyn munches on a banana
<KanyeNorthEast> you referenced rocky so...i went with a quote
<LordCelestia> ill tell you other places to find bananas
<Octavia> 13When we get the separate rooms setup. During the announcements we do. Are we going to try and make it so they come through to all the rooms from only one room? Or are we going to have to do it separately at the same time for each room? Since I dont know the exact specifics of how its being done.
<Fluttershy> >> um....
<LordCelestia> would you like to know?
<Hero_Spirit> Wait, Celestia, are you actually Italian? Not just a name?
<LordCelestia> yeah^
*Sumica glomps Octavia instead.
<Hero_Spirit> Can you translate that theme sometime? :3

<Hero_Spirit> Bronies make too much stuff
<Pontang> Oh hi
<KanyeNorthEast> I know, its ridiculous
<Hero_Spirit> there is absolutely no way to see it all
<Hero_Spirit> :[
<KanyeNorthEast> I don't think i've seen a more creative fanbase
<KanyeNorthEast> that wasn't full of stupid shit (like avatar)
<hindenburg900> Halo
<hindenburg900> Hallo*
<Pontang> How's it going?
<Natleyn> I'm working on seeing as much as I like, but sweet celestia x.x
<telemundo> It's going
<telemundo> Kinda
<Hero_Spirit> I mean geez.
<Pontang> I see
<Synros> hey Luna
<Pontang> Haven't been here long have you? We're in the process of moving stuff around.
<Hero_Spirit> We'd need two lifetimes to get through it all.
<Luna> 07busy catching up? :)
<KanyeNorthEast> from novel length fanfics to all the pmvs.
<DecapKing> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-all-pokemon-games-are-the-same-plays-call-of-duty-hours-a-day.jpg
<Natleyn> I could do it in a year, if they stopped now. >.>
<Synros> pretty much lol
<KanyeNorthEast> and just think, this next season will give even more material
<Luna> 07How far did you get on the forums?
<Natleyn> Decap: Not pokemon, but I know people like that -.-
<telemundo> I see, someone linked me from eqd
<KanyeNorthEast> more background ponies, more songs
<Natleyn> Even more pony stuff to get x.x
<DecapKing> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-you-may-have-to-use-burn-heal-otherwise.jpg
<Synros> I got most of the interviews done.
<Natleyn> HAAH.
<Synros> I got to say, Tacowiz...lol
<Pontang> Ah
<Pontang> Should be more users soon. We're changing names.
<Natleyn> And I'm adding content. Whoo....
<Natleyn> GUISE, DECISION TIME, and I need yer help
<KanyeNorthEast> I look at the trope "all fanfic writers are girls" and I wonder if thats true for mlp
<Natleyn> ^Well, I've writing one, so... -shrugs-
<Luna> 07well please vote on the applications if possible
<KanyeNorthEast> which one?
<Luna> 07also state your opinion on them
<KanyeNorthEast> that nightcourt one?
<Natleyn> No, no.
<Synros> ok
<Natleyn> Nothing published yet.
<KanyeNorthEast> ah, whats it about?
<Natleyn> It's terrible and small, but I won't give up until it's awesome and stupidly long.
<KanyeNorthEast> Then write away! write till you're competing with past sins
<Natleyn> Twilight inventing technology and taking over everything, and a savior rising up and taking her out, ect.
<telemundo> Is that part of the move to bronychan.net?
<Natleyn> ERGH
<Pontang> Lol no.
<Pontang> xD
<Hero_Spirit> Hot Patootie, bless mah soul. I really love that rock and roll.
<Pontang> bronychan doesn't exist.
<Pontang> :p
<Hero_Spirit> DAMNIT RHPS
<Pontang> It was a typo.
<KanyeNorthEast> hm, hopefully its magic technology or steampunk
<KanyeNorthEast> its just a jump to the left
<KanyeNorthEast> and a step to the right
<Natleyn> Decision: keep this oversaturated color and get this-
<KanyeNorthEast> steampunk = automatically 20% cooler
<Hero_Spirit> Don't you stat Kanye. :I
<Natleyn> Y'know, nevermind.
<Natleyn> I'll just redo it by hand. Time isn't really an issued...
<Natleyn> issue, even.
<Hero_Spirit> Nat... what you makin.
<EspyLacopa> Hero_Spirit: You doing the TIME WARP AGAIN?
<Natleyn> Starting on the Twilight set of cursors.
<Hero_Spirit> Hot Patootie right now. :0
<telemundo> Oh, cus eqd has irc.bronychan.net listed, so I was confused
<Hero_Spirit> Ooh, very nice Nat.
<Pontang> Yeah, very much so.
<Hero_Spirit> Best be letting me know when it's done. :p
<Natleyn> Luna's done. -.-
<Natleyn> 4 freaking loading cursors.
<Luna> 07wait what?
<Luna> 07I heard my name
<Natleyn> Last one seemed kinda crappy, but it looks... nice in execution.
<Luna> 07show me
<Natleyn> I'm making cursors based off the color schemes of ponies. And some pony-themed stuff, like the Mare in the Moon for Luna's loading cursor
<Natleyn> Uhh. I'll make a temporary dropbox link. Hold on
<hindenburg900> Haha whoops
*Luna loves dropboxes
*Luna needs more space
<Pontang> =3
<farts> hi
<Natleyn> Luna, you're using Windows, right?
<Luna> 07Oui
<Pontang> Hello
<Hero_Spirit> Zat is correct
<Natleyn> Which version?
<Hero_Spirit> Madam
<Luna> 07Zat is correct monsieur
<Natleyn> 7 or XP?
<Luna> 077
<Natleyn> Alrighty-o.
<Hero_Spirit> Can I test it too? :3
<farts> i hrd this was a place to meet horsefuckers like myself
<telemundo> Wtf
<Pontang> ;x
<Pontang> Hello sai
<Pontang> err
<Natleyn> 'course.
<Pontang> octo
<Pontang> :|
*Luna thinks no-pony understood her reference
<Natleyn> Pinkamina?
<KanyeNorthEast> sadly I don't get it
<Hero_Spirit> Seems familiar Luna
<Hero_Spirit> But I don't know from what
<Luna> 07No, no it was about the dropbox space :-)
<farts> rt has joined
<Luna> 07inb4 spaceeeee
<farts> helo rt
<Natleyn> Nope, sorry. u.u
<Natleyn> Linky linkaroo: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20458213/Luna%27s%20CS%20Themed%20Cursors.zip
<rt> starbuck farts
<Natleyn> If you have windows, http://realworld-change-cursor.software.informer.com/ is nice.
<Natleyn> It lets you set cursors from the right click context menu.
<farts> hello
<Luna> 07how does it work?
<Luna> 07can I get a preview?
<Natleyn> The change cursor?
<Pontang> lol
<farts> oh hy
<Luna> 07ah I see :)
<Natleyn> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20458213/untitled.PNG
<Luna> 07dat looks like windows xp!
<Natleyn> I'm still using XP.
<Luna> 07:D
<Natleyn> Game compatability.
<telemundo> Welcome to 2002
<Natleyn> I have 7 on my netbook.
<Luna> 07Ohhh you use a netbook too?
<Luna> 07awesome!
<Natleyn> I have a netbook that I got while in college and a laptop.
<Natleyn> Laptop is a crappy dell gaming laptop from 2005, netbook is a 2010 dell netbook.
<Natleyn> They have almost identical stats, but the netbook has a little less processing power and .4gb less RAM.
<DashiteAlt> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU~
<telemundo> Wait .4 like 400 mb?
<Luna> 07whats wrong dash?
<Natleyn> Yeah, about.
<Hero_Spirit> How... how do I know how to use which cursor for what D:
<DashiteAlt> My internet is about 95% derp right now.
<Luna> 07dash is out now ;)
<Luna> 07relog
<Natleyn> They're all labeled in whatever position I use them in
<telemundo> Don't use Internet, use an iron
<DashiteAlt> My internet will drop again in a few minutes and it'll swap back over itself...
<Hero_Spirit> Should I use the v2 versions?
<Natleyn> Standard is the normal cursor, vert. resize is the vertical resize...
<Natleyn> All versions have the same quality, it's just whichever you want to use.
<Natleyn> Text select v2's click-area thingy is in the middle of the middle line, though.
<Natleyn> Huh. I should have a better labeling system... alt and versions don't mean the same thing
<Dashite> 4 minutes. I was right with my first guess.
<Hero_Spirit> What is "working in background"? Like, should I use one of the loading ones for that, or....
<Natleyn> Working in background means it's loading something, while busy means the program is frozen. I think.
<Natleyn> Loading cursors, yeah.
<Natleyn> And IMO, the moon in loading v1 is horrid.
<KanyeNorthEast> Did you make the cursor the moon going through all its phases? that would be cool
<KanyeNorthEast> the loading cursor I mean
<Natleyn> Try it out o.o
<Hero_Spirit> Any clue what "alternate select" is?
<Natleyn> The moon goes through a dark and light phase, yes. No, not many details on that moon...
<Natleyn> Nope! I've seen it flash once or twice while I was looking at something else, but the cursor has never stuck around
<Natleyn> Some websites use it, though.
<Hero_Spirit> What should I put for it? Just anything? Also, any clue on "handwriting"?
<Natleyn> I didn't make a handwriting. Nopony I know has ever seen it.
<Natleyn> I'll remake a quill eventually, but... ehh.
<KanyeNorthEast> haha, cromartie high + my little pony
<Natleyn> Maybe for like, drawing or something in Microsoft Word? >_>
<KanyeNorthEast> or would that be cromaretie high?
<Hero_Spirit> This cursor is nice. :0
<Natleyn> Hiya Val, if you're there.
<Natleyn> Which one?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I am not there :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I am here
*Natleyn hugs ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 how very kind!
*ValtheJean hugs Natleyn back
<Natleyn> :3
<KanyeNorthEast> what's the difference between halfop and op?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the amount of commands you can do
<Natleyn> ^
<Natleyn> Privileges are limited.
<Natleyn> Exactly what they can use is determined on a channel by channel basis, IIRC
<Natleyn> Hah.
<Natleyn> IIRC.
<KanyeNorthEast> ah, so you're like a janitor instead of a mod
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >.<
<Hero_Spirit> Everyone knows janitors are secretly badass.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I like you Hero_spirit :P
<Hero_Spirit> :P
<KanyeNorthEast> hong kong fooey was a janitor, and he was badass
<Hero_Spirit> Yesh!
<KanyeNorthEast> though I prefer El Kabong
<Natleyn> Hero, hows the cursors?
<Hero_Spirit> I like them. I think I'll use these until you finish the Twilight ones :p
<ValtheJean> so, would anyone mind getting me up to speed on what happened with the Seth conversation?
<Natleyn> :D!
<Natleyn> <3
<Hero_Spirit> well, I've gotta pack in.

<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's the time Hasbro decided to air it :P
<telemundo> Oh hasbro, you used to be cool
<KanyeNorthEast> hey, it could be worse. it could be late at night like all the prime-time shows
<telemundo> Not really
<KanyeNorthEast> then you'd have all saturday to anticipate it. instead you get to wake up early to ponies
<ValtheJean> 2,14 best way to start the day :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 or you could just not go to sleep, and join us for our S1 stream :P
<KanyeNorthEast> and then follow the fandom and its explosion the rest of the day
<KanyeNorthEast> sleep is for the weak!

<Razyn> NewDCD can stream in his sleep and doesn't afraid of anything
<KanyeNorthEast> magneto?
<Octavia> 13"Lmao. Oh Hasbro, you so silly!" :D
<Fourze> that was hilarious
<Sumica> I dont get it.
<Octavia> 13Its an inside joke.
<Octavia> 13From The Brony Show Marethon yesterday.
<Sumica> oh yes I forgot to watch that part.
<Octavia> 13I missed most of it, was here. lol
*Octavia 13was listening to it a little during Rocky Horror >.>;;;
<Sumica> They put up a clip from that part.
<Sumica> that was what I forgot to watch.
<Octavia> 13Yeah, they put up clips from a lot of it.
<Sumica> seems it was part of an ad that kept poping up throught out the stream nere the end of it.
<Sumica> for x men first class.
<Barry> How many people have played F-Zero X?
<Sumica> not I
<Sumica> ....oki I can see why people found it so funny now that I am seeing it.
<Barry> Well I was just doing so on an emulator, and I have to say, I enjoyed it up until the Joker Cup.
<FreezeFrame> And someone from Hasbro is monitoring EqD enough to do this.
<Sumica> I am not sure if that is real or not.
<FreezeFrame> awww, just a URL manipulation to look up an X-Men toy through MLP skin
<KanyeNorthEast> i'm sure hasbro is excited that someone, anyone, is excited about one of their products.
<KanyeNorthEast> all they had going for it was Michael Bay
<Sumica> yeah had a fealing it was something like that KanyeNorthEast
<Dashite> Barry, I've play F-Zero X
<KanyeNorthEast> I just hope that the execs are smart enough to stay away
<Luna> 07Wow
<Luna> 07it's silent :)
<FreezeFrame> Whoever Hasbro put in charge of the MLP Facebook and Twitter is brony-friendly.
*Luna drops a needle
<KanyeNorthEast> personally I give it 3-4 seasons before they figure they should cash in and make a movie.
<KanyeNorthEast> and then its all down hill from there
<FreezeFrame> Movie could be good.
<Luna> 07>implying they did not make a movie in the past?
<KanyeNorthEast> well a movie for FIM
<FreezeFrame> I mean, the one we'll be watching on the next BMN is well known.
*Sumica hands luna the droped neddle.
<KanyeNorthEast> movies tend to bring in a whole lot more money and new 'talent' so that they can be sure it'll make them money.
<KanyeNorthEast> look at spongebob
<ValtheJean> is anyone else getting that join spam?
<FreezeFrame> Yay, a join/part spammer.
*Luna is preparing for her magic
<JLYIOADF> buttefartez
<FreezeFrame> Weird Al needs to have a part in the movie.
<Sumica> I really need to learn how to turn off those messages.
<KanyeNorthEast> they'd probably go for broke and put a human in the movie
<FreezeFrame> Could be done well.
<FreezeFrame> Megan wasn't horrible
<KanyeNorthEast> curse you for your optimism, why can't you be as cynical as me?
<Luna> 07yep..
<Luna> 07watching it
<FreezeFrame> I can be cynical, but for some reason, ponies make me really optimistic.
<FreezeFrame> Either that or Lauren Faust does it.
<FreezeFrame> Ooooooh, there's an awesome nick.
<Dark_Heart> sup guys, hey, ah, whats up with the website?
<Luna> 07what's up with it?
<Dark_Heart> why can't I watch anything
<Luna> 07because we are not streaming?
<KanyeNorthEast> the stream is not going
<Luna> 07how you like the watermark?
<Dark_Heart> or
<Dark_Heart> oh
<LPM> they call me fartez
<LPM> butte fartez
<KanyeNorthEast> I actually think next week is going to be the hardest, all the speculation for part 2
<Luna> 07next week?
<KanyeNorthEast> next week after episode 1
<Dark_Heart> so is there a new streaming formate or something now
<FreezeFrame> Ah, /ignore
<Luna> 07I'm curious how many bronies will join to watch the season kick-off with us
<FreezeFrame> I'll be here
<Dark_Heart> Iwill
<KanyeNorthEast> I probably will, though i'm not sure about the "entire night" part
<FreezeFrame> No Hub in my room, and no bronies that I know of on campus to watch it with who did buy digital.
<Dark_Heart> so when will it stream
<KanyeNorthEast> which uni?
<FreezeFrame> Keuka College
<KanyeNorthEast> wheres that?
<FreezeFrame> On Keuka Lake :P

<FreezeFrame> Okay, finally finished facebooking for the night
<FreezeFrame> I'd forgotten to let some people know about the play, so I just made it my FB status
<farts> does this happen often
<FreezeFrame> Now, finally, I sleep for 5 hours before my Alarm wakes me up to Winter Wrap Up
*VioletVanilla has a suspicion "farts" is the culprit. x.x
