<Meanwhile> Can't stand having the dings on damage enabled.
<cowvarkian> <.<
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile, even if the dings were Pinkie saying "Honk!"?
<pony_9375> ^
<Meanwhile> That'd be even worse.
<cowvarkian> then it must be
<Meanwhile> Any time I went heavy or pyro it'd be nothing but "Honkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonk"
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Meanwhile> That'd get on my nerves.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AssaultWithEmbraces> true.

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Why can't it be the "Mine"
<AJIsAwesome> Surgery, hmm yes?
<cowvarkian> harumph
<Kandarihu> Does it seem to anyone else that the Engineer is the most popular class?
<Meanwhile> Engineer is popular with people who don't like having to move.
<cowvarkian> hey, I don't like moving
<AssaultWithEmbraces> 8-bit Parasprite Polka while firing Sasha or natasha.
<Kandarihu> Not for playing, I meant as in general.
<Meanwhile> In terms of personality?
<Kandarihu> I guess it's true that Valve has worked hard to make sure that none of the classes are overtly the most popular of all of them
<AJIsAwesome> I always found the Medic/Pyro the most popular class besides the Engineer.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Second class I played was Engineer.
<Kandarihu> This is one interesting map
<Meanwhile> Well the engi's a good natured chap with a nice voice and an amusing accent.
<Brony> hai
<cowvarkian> ohai
<Meanwhile> It's hard not to passively like him.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi Brony

<VenHur> Favorite map is the Mario Kart map.
<cowvarkian> and not enough i's
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, take it as a light joke. .-.
<aniderp> hi
<AdamTheDuck> It's not like I actually hate ponies. >.>
<AdamTheDuck> Hello aniderp
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, aniderp.
<prince-dari> Trolling is against the rules. Unless you're a mod
<prince-dari> Then it's a requirement
<prince-dari> <:
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: WUT :D
<cowvarkian> oh dabi

<cowvarkian> gah, forgot how to spell
<Meanwhile> Srs bsns.
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, because you broke a clearly established rule.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: we do that all the time
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: You cuold let mods deal with it if they think he's broken a rule
<Kurra> =.=
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, fine
<Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kANUpUjsYgc&feature=related

<Meanwhile> Lol.
<Brony> .....
<AJIsAwesome> Kurra: ?
<Kurra> am tired, barely did anything today. *flump*
<prince-dari> Brony: You should read through our rules page
<Wrek> 05aaaah
<AJIsAwesome> And FAQ page. :)
<taoumi> well that was a good nap
<Wrek> 05THIS IS GREAT
<prince-dari> Brony: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<cowvarkian> yes, so you can break the rules, but know you did it
<Wrek> 05too abd it isnt planetside though xD
<Kurra> also, is REALLY disheartening when an admin says that trolling is required if you're an admin. :/
<Kandarihu> There was a better way to approach this that I should've tried instead.
<Meanwhile> Not long now Wrek.
<AdamTheDuck> BrownieStaet is srs bsns
<cowvarkian> Kurra: apparently you've never seen dari on chat before
<taoumi> dat lag screan
<Kandarihu> Kurra, I'd be disheartened by that if not for the way that Sumica and ValtheJean trolls us.
<prince-dari> Kurra: Well if you're in distrestt, you could call up on the sea ponies.
<Kurra> I have, and I've been hoping that he is kidding... :/
<cowvarkian> that too
<prince-dari> distress*
<Meanwhile> Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
<Meanwhile> Call upon the sea ponies when you're in distress~
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: that's meant to be trolling?
<Kandarihu> Half of the mods troll us with pre-G4 ponies, and that's a harmless way to troll us.
<Meanwhile> Helpful as can be ponies simply signal S.O.S
<Kurra> prince-dari, It is not distress... and... I hope you don't go only kicking and baning people. I saw that happen once.
<Meanwhile> If you find you're cast adrift, and haven't got an oar (OAR)
<taoumi> minecraft
<cowvarkian> It's Bacon and Applejack!
<Meanwhile> Call upon the sea ponies they'll see you to shore~
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But what if you're in the middle of a desert? Seaponies can't swim in sand.
<prince-dari> >IRC
<Kurra> Admins can be very.... I can't think of the right word :/

<AssaultWithEmbraces> Here comes the Nom Monster!
<AdamTheDuck> DashWithRainbows, ^^^
*cowvarkian hides NewSuperBronyU
<Kurra> Admins are authorities, no matter how silly or anything else the channel.
<prince-dari> Pfft. We're not a business.
<Meanwhile> But RashWithDainbows, we'd lose half the audience.
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: how do you know
<Kurra> But you are authorities.
<AdamTheDuck> Admns are srs bsns
<prince-dari> An internet authority.
<DashWithRainbows> We'd have more Eman's in here, Meanwhile.
<Vivix> Some of them are authoritarian, some of them aren't much
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02We're a porn site. Porn sites are not businesses, they are social experiences.
<Meanwhile> Dabi, stop enjoying yourself.
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: :S
<cowvarkian> NewSuperBronyU: hmm
<killerpony7733> NewSuperBronyU Cooool
<Kurra> But no one cares.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NewSuperBronyU, wat
<thelonepony> NewSuperBronyU: wut?
<cowvarkian> AssaultWithEmbraces: yeah, this is totally porn
<Meanwhile> You can't be a porn site, if boobs appear on the streamer the streamer gets hammered.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Except we put on clothes instead of taking them off...cause we're ponies
<Meanwhile> the stream the streamer*
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Ponies are normally naked.
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: >Implying everyone here is a pony
<RaveBrony> :L
<CCCP> Is porn good or bad for youth?
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: hah
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: I see what you actually typed there
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Well...this site is for ponies only...
<prince-dari> Kurra: You seem to be one of those people that makes the internet out to be 'srs bsns'
<AssaultWithEmbraces> When was the last time you saw an animal wearing clothes, pets excluded.
<cowvarkian> AssaultWithEmbraces: last tuesday
<Wrek> 05i like these songs :3
<Meanwhile> Last month I saw an Alpaca wearing a fedora, if that coutns.
<Meanwhile> counts*
<cowvarkian> Wrek: norly
<pony_1877> hey guys
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, What is this song?
<Kurra> It's not the internet I take serious. It's the actions individuals take, and what they mean.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Was it fabulous~
<CCCP> AssaultWithEmbraces i see all these humans wearing clothes
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile, an alpaca....wearing a fedora....?
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome: It gobbed on the floor, so not really.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> CCCP, humans and pets exluded
<cowvarkian> Kurra: how do you know we're not all a computer
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i liek Wrek :3
<cowvarkian> Kurra: we could be some blob living on a planet lightyears away
<Kurra> But because memes say srs b'ness, and because it more easy than it is right to do what's popular, I'll get shooed off. :/
<AJIsAwesome> What WAS that? :S
<pony_1877> while i eat your brain
<AJIsAwesome> Was that what I thought it was? :S
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsAwesome, it was a finger
<DerpyMuffins> Nice play list Wrek
<cowvarkian> AssaultWithEmbraces: you're a finger
<Kurra> ARGH also why do I miss writing words >_O
<AssaultWithEmbraces> cowvarkian, nou
<cowvarkian> ok
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: What was it doing?
<Kurra> I liked this place. :(
<pony_1877> hi Blackalpha
<Black_Alpha> hi
<pony_1877> whats up
<Meanwhile> Wrek that spray is...I don't even know.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<cowvarkian> Kurra: from what I can tell, nothing's changed
<prince-dari> What, so as an admin I'm not allowed to joke around with people in the chat? I should just be the paradigm of totalitarianism?
<CCCP> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Okay everyone, calm down?
<cowvarkian> princess dairy, apparently so
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02We rule with an iron fist. No fun allowed.
<Meanwhile> dari you couldn't do that if you tried. Someone'll mention Matt Smith.
<Chrysalis> take on me?
<prince-dari> Pfft
<AJIsAwesome> Matt Smith.
<cowvarkian> NewSuperBronyU: a topaz fist would be more effective
<Kurra> Nah, do joke, just... it's a really bad thing when jokes are made through kicks and bans.
<Meanwhile> Wouldn't joke about that Super, some people think that's how the place works as it is.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Anyone who sees someone else having fun is required to report them at once. They are criminals.
<CCCP> prince-dari totalitarnism can be awesome
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: what kind of idiot thinks that?
*Lil_B leaves *pop*
<prince-dari> Hard Times taught me otherwise.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NewSuperBronyU, oh look I'm having fuun! Youuuu can't get meeeeee!
<prince-dari> Most boring book ever written.
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Couldn't they just lie and get away with it?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02FUN ALARM ACTIVATED
*AssaultWithEmbraces runs around distributing pillows
<AJIsAwesome> D:
<AJIsAwesome> NOT THE PILLOWS!
<CCCP> sounds like a hard time prince-dari
<cowvarkian> NewSuperBronyU: what fun, I see no fun
<AJIsAwesome> They're nice and fluffy!
<Kandarihu> Who ever said that fun is against any sort of rule? It's only a problem when it's fun at somepony else's expense
<Meanwhile> I hope you learned your lesson. Stop enjoying yourself.
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: we're being facetious
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NewSuperBronyU :3
<Meanwhile> Why can't you be a good law abiding citizen and sit quietly in silence like everyone else. >:I
<Kurra> okay.
<cowvarkian> Meanwhile: ._.
*NewSuperBronyU huggles AssaultWithEmbraces :3
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Because sitting's boring? :3
*AssaultWithEmbraces huggles NewSuperBronyU
<Meanwhile> Boring is good!
<Meanwhile> Boring is the only way to live!
<prince-dari> I don't think I've ever seen an IRC room where joke kicks don't happen every so often
<Kandarihu> Ooh, Wrek has become Rainbow Dash, I think.
<Meanwhile> Here, read the Dictionary.
<prince-dari> It's just a staple of IRC
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Meanwhile: Now I know why you hate Nintendo...
<CCCP> Going to to a book burning tomorrow what should i bring?
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: Sorry if I ask again, but what was that pony doing?
<Kurra> I've been in a place where they don't happen.
<Kurra> anyway.
<cowvarkian> CCCP: an assault weapon, to kill all of those hicks?
<Meanwhile> Super: Because it's rehashed garbage for 12 year olds and housewives.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> AJIsAwesome, there was a finger in the pony's mouth and it looks suggestive from a distance.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But it's really not
<Meanwhile> I thought I was clear on that already.
<Kurra> :/
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: Oh. :S
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Like doing pixel/dot art
<CCCP> cowvarkian but then i would hurt them :C
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But you like boring? You therefore like Nintendo by that logic?
<Meanwhile> You're having fun AssaultWithEmbraces you have no opinion.
<cowvarkian> CCCP: that's the point
<Meanwhile> Super I'm following your example! I'm trying to ruin peoples fun.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile, squige.
<Shizuka> 13i like how we're actively trying to drive people away now
<Chrysalis> well duh, nintendo havnt done anything new in years
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: ikr
<RaveBrony> So i noticed
<RaveBrony> :L
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I like my opinions.
<CCCP> cowvarkian but I don't like hurting americans
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: I'm pretty sure they have
<Chrysalis> like what
<cowvarkian> CCCP: I do
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Example: Dumbledore is awesome
<Meanwhile> Ah you don't need to try, it's working slowly but surely anyway.
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: gimme a second
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Natural selection. I naturally select people to just go.
<prince-dari> I try, shame it doesn't work more often. :P
<Meanwhile> lol.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I have another opinion: I think ponies are awesome!
<AdamTheDuck> AssaultWithEmbraces, ewwwww
<Meanwhile> Shhh, opinions are against the rules.
*AdamTheDuck slaps AssaultWithEmbraces around a bit with a large trout
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Let's talk about Wii U now!
<Meanwhile> Pfft no.
*Chrysalis gives everyone a big hug
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Wii U is awesome :O
<Chrysalis> except meanwhile
<MLP_Brovakiin> naat
<Chrysalis> he gets a trixie plushie
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: :D
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Meanwhile> Har de har har.
<cowvarkian> Chrysalis: are we being exculsive to 1st party developers, or do third party developers count
<AssaultWithEmbraces> inb4 cinderblocks everywhere
<Chrysalis> quick eveyone, meanwhil loves trixie
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: You could just put it in the fireplace.
*MLP_Brovakiin Chrysalis :3
<Chrysalis> pm him trixie pics
<CCCP> http://images.4chan.org/wsg/src/1353357485550.gif
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Chrysalis back :3
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I value my life, Chrysalis
<Meanwhile> This game looks really one sided.
<RaveBrony> I thot you got kicked for that.
<RaveBrony> Or was that otakon shipping?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I see Nittany_Discord~
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm sorry I thought this was BronyState not BronyHate.
<Meanwhile> That was otakon shipping.
<Chrysalis> otakon shipping is still kicking in believe
<RaveBrony> Ah
<cowvarkian> RaveBrony: I still haven't gotten kicked for otakon shipping
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NewSuperBronyU, no it's MinecraftState :3
<Meanwhile> Because otakon has this habit of getting very angry very easily.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02CookieState :D
<RaveBrony> :I
<AssaultWithEmbraces> SillyState
<Meanwhile> Like when I photoshopped his head onto Frodo Baggins.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo :3/
*Chrysalis states all the bronies
<cowvarkian> otakon x state
<thelonepony> NewSuperBronyU: now that i will enjoy :D
<AJIsAwesome> Killer Krab.......State!
<MLP_Brovakiin> BarneyState
<Meanwhile> Or when I shopped his head onto Santa Claus.
<RaveBrony> Dat Manmelter
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: NO.
<AJIsAwesome> JUST NO.
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Sorry ;~;
<AJIsAwesome> We don't need Barneystate again.
<Meanwhile> Or a potato. Or the Grinch. Or...you know maybe I do that too much.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> What happened during BarneyState?
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AJIsAwesome> YOU.
<CCCP> http://images.4chan.org/wsg/src/1353339355521.gif

<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: Lolwut
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: he started to creep people out :D
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AdamTheDuck> wat XD
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I used to be able to do a Tom Cruise laugh and creep out my friends.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I think I still got it a little.
<AJIsAwesome> AssaultWithEmbraces: That's awesome! :D
<Meanwhile> AssaultWithEmbraces: http://i.imgur.com/GdH5F.png
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: I'm saving that.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Meanwhile, nah. Scientology-crazy Tom Cruise laugh
<AdamTheDuck> Well I'm off, bye everyone.
<CCCP> http://i.imgur.com/pgBxf.jpg
<thelonepony> Bye AdamTheDuck :)
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye, AdamTheDuck
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, AdamTheDuck. :)
<CCCP> bye AdamTheDuck
<Meanwhile> It's not possible to recreate the crazy of Scientology without taking it seriously.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I don't even acknowledge it.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> I just go "Huh" and continue listening to my music
<thelonepony> CCCP: i got something similar to that, it's called Jarritos :P
<CCCP> AssaultWithEmbraces what if you werent listening to music in the first place?
<cowvarkian> CCCP: then he stabs the person

<AssaultWithEmbraces> cowvarkian, well just remove a sting and continue
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: he said bumblebee
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dark_Horst, she
<Dark_Horst> she
<CCCP> cowvarkian thats just because you arnt a tree
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: apparently I don't know how bumblees work then
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: bitches fly solo and sting whenever the fuck they want
<Dark_Horst> haf one sting me once. hurt like fuck
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: coolio

<Eli> i'm back. who's playing?
<thelonepony> wrek
<MLP_Brovakiin> welcome back Eli :)
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek is. :)
<Eli> ohh i don't even have wrek
<thelonepony> wb Eli :)
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back. :)
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: whoa
<Dark_Horst> dude gets better with every image
<Eli> i'm guessing his name is Wrek on steam?
<Dark_Horst> yes
<AJIsAwesome> Yep. :3
<ekips> Ohai all and welcome back Wrek :3
<thelonepony> Hi ekips :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai ekips :)
<Eli> aand there's my ping
<cratorkid> herro everypony
<thelonepony> Hi cratorkid :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, ekips and cratorkid. :
<AJIsAwesome> *:)
<cratorkid> hey thelonepony and AJIsAwesome
<CCCP> hi ekips
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai cratorkid :)
<CCCP> :(
<Saturn> 08,01okay, question
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<cratorkid> yes?
<thelonepony> okay shoot
<Eli> go for it
*MLP_Brovakiin shoots thelonepony :3
<ekips> here we go... ( ;) )
*thelonepony dies
<MLP_Brovakiin> D:
<MLP_Brovakiin> nuuuu ;~;
<cratorkid> the anticipation!
<AJIsAwesome> Brovakiin? Why? ;~;
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: he told me to ;~;
*thelonepony had no extra lives
<AJIsAwesome> Not LITERALLY! ;~:
*AJIsAwesome hands thelonepony a 1-UP
<MLP_Brovakiin> sorry! ;~;
<Saturn> 08,01so suppose single sleeps with a married person who is in a monogamous relationship, and both have gone in knowing this
<Saturn> 08,01is that immoral for the single person?
<thelonepony> why you shoot MLP_Brovakiin ;~;
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonepony: you told me to :c
<CCCP> no
<Eli> Saturn: for both in my opinion.
<thelonepony> it hurts man ;^;
*MLP_Brovakiin huggles thelonepony "Sorry" :c
<Eli> Saturn: depends if the partner of the married person knows and is ok with it
<CCCP> Saturn its only immoral if you think it is.
<Meanwhile> I agree with Eli.
<cratorkid> its only immoral if the maried persons' spouse disagrees
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: nope
<Eli> CCCP: that's bull. could i kill you just because i think its not immoral?
<Meanwhile> Saturn has no morals, so I don't know why this question was asked anyway.
<cratorkid> Eli: you could, but the law decideds what to do, regardles of morals
<CCCP> Eli im not saying i think its right but morals are for the weak
<Saturn> 08,01the way i see it, if the single person is not coercing/bribing/blackmailing the married person, he is not at fault
<cratorkid> ^
<Eli> CCCP: are you one of this funny anarchists?
<prince-dari> Eli: Morality comes from what is socially acceptable
<Saturn> 08,01he is a third party to the relationship; it's the married person's responsibility to stay within the bounds of their relationship
<prince-dari> It's not inherently bad to do anything
<cratorkid> Eli: anarchy is the best
<prince-dari> We've just decided it is
<Meanwhile> So despite being aware that it's a married person, they did it anyway?
<CCCP> Eli i was joking i dont like anarchy or freedom
<Meanwhile> That's slimy.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: nihilism! \o/
<Alchemist> morality is not about who is "at fault"
<Eli> prince-dari: i don't think so. i think you should have a bit your own moral. do to others only what you want them to do to you
<prince-dari> Eli: Let me give you an example then
<Saturn> 08,01well, i'm not arguing the morality of it; i just want to see your views on it
<prince-dari> Around about 50 years ago it would be seen as immoral to be gay/have gay relationships
<Meanwhile> It's slimy.
<CCCP> Eli you just agreed with my first statement
<Saturn> 08,01those damn gays.
<Alchemist> Saturn: well then, its not really different than hitting on a man/woman who already is in a relationship and its okay in my book.
<ekips> O u Saturn
<prince-dari> Now most civilised countries don't think that way any more
<bicyclerepairman> it's wrong for the single as well, he should respect the married person's commitment to the partner he had sex with
<Meanwhile> ^
<Eli> CCCP: to a certain degree yes.
<prince-dari> Morals change because they are defined by public opinion, not because anything is inherently good or bad.
<Eli> bicyclerepairman: that sums it up i guess
<Alchemist> bicyclerepairman: if he agrees to screw around there wasnt that much of a commitment to begin with...
<Eli> to cratorkid... anarchy? really? it's just plain stupid
<bicyclerepairman> I'm talking about the other one, Alchemist
<Michael> ohai everypony :)
<bicyclerepairman> like, the one he hasn't had sex with
<CCCP> hi Michael
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Michael. :)

<Meanwhile> More interesting than anything else that's happened in the past 5 minutes.
<VenHur> Dat TRON soundtrack.
<Alchemist> If I feel some way, I wouldnt submit it for a stranger's. If I knew the other person of course I wouldnt interfere with the relationship.
<Eli> so i'm not the only one listening to daft punk while gaming :P

<Dark_Horst> magic, magnets and a little bit of plot conveniance
<SirGanjalf> retrospection!
<[SWAG]Haku> SPACE
<[SWAG]Haku> THE FINAL FRONTIER
<DerpyMuffins> You should see Wrek's R34 of Sumica OC
<[SWAG]Haku> UNLESS YOUR IN JAPAN
<Nyra> Curious, Sumica. Dont take offence, are you a woman? I simply assume because of female OC.
<SirGanjalf> doggy?
<[SWAG]Haku> IN WHICH CASE EVERYONES IN SOACE
<Flaria> This is how they found her~
<Everlasting_Joy> Suddenly 2001.
<[SWAG]Haku> She was an alien
<[SWAG]Haku> DUN DUN DUN
<Nyra> BEWBS!
<Kandarihu> Sumi's a dude
<Flaria> Nono...
<Sumica> 00,10nope but people asumed and thus
<twilight_sprinkle> suddenly evangelion
<Flaria> riri...
<DerpyMuffins> Sumica is a guy I believe
<LunaRoyalGuard> :O
<Flaria> nak nak
<Flaria> ko
<[SWAG]Haku> BS
<Dark_Horst> Nyra: it'S an r63'd oc
<[SWAG]Haku> You cant talk in space
<Nyra> Ok.
<Dark_Horst> Nyra: you do know r83, dont you?
<SirGanjalf> Oh, so she's an alien robot with boobs..
<Dark_Horst> ?63
<Nyra> What does that mean Dark
<Dark_Horst> **
<Dark_Horst> Nyra: gender swap
<Nyra> Sorry for neb questioin.
<Flaria> Reverse gender character Nyra
<MirrorImage> Nyra - "Rule 63 - if it exists, there is a version of it of the opposite gender"
<Sumica> 00,10it's fine
<Nyra> Ohh, okay.
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<LunaRoyalGuard> (;¬_¬)
<Dark_Horst> basically it says that for every character created, there is a gender swapped version on ´the internet
<Sumica> 00,10I am long acustomed to it
<Nyra> Now I know, and...
<Canada_Brony> I'm back!!!
<Sumica> 00,10people assumed with the name
<Dark_Horst> indeed
<SirGanjalf> Heh, i think my first contact with rule63 was in good ol' Baldur's Gate
<LunaRoyalGuard> ohai Canada_Brony
<Kandarihu> I'd like to see his OC non-R63 in Desktop Pony form, though.
<MirrorImage> Sumica - so one of these days, you need to change your name to "Sumico" and see if anyone picks up on it
<Nyra> Lol, mine was in WoW.
<Canada_Brony> Whats R63?
<Dark_Horst> now that just yound stupid
<Kandarihu> Canada_Brony, genderswapping
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: and then you trolled them, and some of the dumv ones took it at face value
<Dark_Horst> Canada_Brony: i jsut explained
<Canada_Brony> oh,ok
<[SWAG]Haku> My first time seeing R63 was on Futurama
<RoboGerbil> Canada_Brony: rule 63: everything wil be ponified
<Dark_Horst> no
<thelonepony> [SWAG]Haku: the episode?
<Nyra> lol, its okay Canada_Brony, I didnt know what it meant either.
<twilight_sprinkle> sure black holes, why not
<Kandarihu> RoboGerbil, that's a different rule
<SirGanjalf> that's rule63b?
<DerpyMuffins> R34.2 is everything is ponified
<[SWAG]Haku> thelonepony I dont know the name, but everyone became the opposite gender
<Dark_Horst> rule 63 means that for every existing character, there is a gender swapped version onn the net
<SirGanjalf> oh, 34b
<Dark_Horst> seriously guys, this is basic stuff
<Canada_Brony> this is confuxing
<Dark_Horst> internet 101
<Flaria> ^
<DerpyMuffins> 34b is ponified stuff
<SpeccyRush> http://rulesoftheinternet.com/index.php?title=Main_Page
<Nyra> I know this sounds bizzare, but I would love to genderswap with Chrysalis.
<Canada_Brony> at least not 34
<thelonepony> [SWAG]Haku: that episode... horrified me :$
<Dark_Horst> Derpy_Hooves: no. it means that porn will be made
<Sumica> 00,10so the long and short of this is. mankind bunkered down in the sol system to hide away from the "space monsteres"
<Dark_Horst> * DerpyMuffins
<[SWAG]Haku> thelonepony wait, nvm, it was the episode where Bender became a woman for the olympics
<thelonepony> dat tab fail
<Sumica> 00,10they set up a defence system and abandonded warp drive
<PonyBean> so its like guren lagen?
<Nyra> God damn Space Monsters!
<Sumica> 00,10the defence system adapted to fight any threats
<[SWAG]Haku> Space Godzilla
<Dark_Horst> if you people wouldnt insist on stealing half of your name together, it wouldnt ahppem
<Nyra> The was another one, eh, Swag.
<[SWAG]Haku> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Canada_Brony> so many rules, so little time
<PonyBean> cuz humans were pushed under ground so the spiral energy wouldnt be detected
<[SWAG]Haku> Nyra yes, yes it was.
<Sumica> 00,10this is the same company that did Gurran laggen
<Sumica> 00,10but this came first
<Flaria> And the Topless resembled the Space Monsters the defence system was built to fight against.
<PonyBean> that explains alot
<Bronysith> Sumica: and NGE
<Everlasting_Joy> "The Toplessness" ... Odd choice for an evil entity.
<Nyra> With the space rock being. Lol. Love Futurama.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #72
<MirrorImage> peeps?
<[SWAG]Haku> Nyra King Ghidora and Gigan were also space monsters
<Dark_Horst> i'd like to point out that rule 34b existed long before ponies and that this version of the rules is faulty
<Nyra> AWESOME Space Monsters!
<Canada_Brony> did you know that R104?
<[SWAG]Haku> Nyra also Olga
<[SWAG]Haku> Or Orga
<[SWAG]Haku> I forget which it was
<Nyra> 20% Cooler Monster
<Flaria> Dark_Horst: 34 existed before... 34b is up for debate
<[SWAG]Haku> But i think it was the one from Gozilla 2000
<Nyra> Love Godzilla 2000
<[SWAG]Haku> some sort of space monmster thing
<thelonepony> [SWAG]Haku: no, there was another episode that the crew and some other people went to a planet, had a race of the sex, the gender change into none, and then he put them in the oppiset genders. and by "him" i mean that Big talking rock that somehow could change peoples gender
<RoboGerbil> lol rule 233
<Dark_Horst> Flaria: i'm very certain there was a 34b the first time i found the rules-list. that was years ago
<Nyra> Yea. It was an island that stood up, flew, then changed into a masive Space Alien Monster.
<[SWAG]Haku> thelonepony yeah, that existed, but that the Futuramas 2nd R63 episode
<thelonepony> eeyup
<thelonepony> :3
<Canada_Brony> did you know that R104?
<Nyra> Then Godzilla kicked its ass!
<[SWAG]Haku> Nyra wasnt that the smog monster?
<Nyra> No, that was from show.
<[SWAG]Haku> oh
<[SWAG]Haku> Which one?
<[SWAG]Haku> Which show?
<[SWAG]Haku> The american Godzilla show, or the japanese one from the 90s?
<Dark_Horst> oh well, there are a hundret different rule lists anyway
<Dark_Horst> so no real way to know which one is right
<Canada_Brony> Who likes the Fausticorn?
<Dark_Horst> the only points they all agree on are 34 and 63
<Flaria> Dark_Horst: Pretty much none, except those two.
<Flaria> Those two make sense.
<[SWAG]Haku> Nyra so you exicted for the new Godzilla film coming next year?
<SirGanjalf> I've heard there was a rule 404, bt i can't find it...
<Everlasting_Joy> SirGanjalf: *rimshot.
<[SWAG]Haku> theres and Error 404
<Sumica> 00,10dohoho

<CCCP> Sumica irk
<Laina> Sumica, One of the bestes parts
<thelonepony> :)*
<aniderp> i bet you cant make a more funny face than this -g3 face- zappp
<AJIsAwesome> I thought the pinkie fingers was the best part.
<Kencolt> It had one of the great classic SF concepts-- Clone Degradation. Although really accellerated.
<CCCP> Ikr*
<LunaRoyalGuard> when watching this I think of persona 4 anime
<Canadian_Brony> And yes Sumi, it was absolutely frightening.
<Rose`> oh !
<Rose`> i know this
<AJIsAwesome> Ok, I'm kidding. The fingers bit was actually pretty creepy.
<Rose`> its... umm.
<Dark_Horst> when pinkie turned around with that face i started convulsing in my chair for 15 minutes
<Rose`> i forget
<CCCP> Hi Phase4
<Laina> Let see this... what was the first reference in that episode, in the first 30 seconds?
<LunaRoyalGuard> what AJIsAwesome said
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: Did you go see a doctor?
<Rose`> ive seen parts of this
<Rose`> its pretty kewl
<Hazard> I just tried and tried to stifle a laugh before I finally fell out of my chair and cried from laughter.
<Phase4> 00,02CCCP, ohai
<Sumica> 00,10looks just like the appartment from excel saga
<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome: yeah. he said he never saw such a severe case of pre-g4 exposure
<Laina> Sumica, hahaa
<Laina> Sumica, Maybe excel out?
<Hazard> Excel Saga is fucking awesome.
<Canadian_Brony> I screamed, ran like f*ck, and tripped over a cardboard box.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Let's go walking you and me :D
<Sumica> 00,10walking at night, are you crazy
<LadyCanary> <3
<LadyCanary> I love this soooooong
<PonyBean> get mugged out there
<Kandarihu> Did I just miss a cold open?
<oni_link> Pfft, I've done that many times before
<Kandarihu> Oh well. I'm gonna show my mom the Macross 7 movie. I don't have time for the Macross Plus movie before it, though.
<Kandarihu> So I'll be out of continuity for this too.
<Sumica> 00,10ewwww macross 7
<Kandarihu> Sure it's weird, but it's been a fun series.
<Sumica> 00,10could not finish it
<Sumica> 00,10hell i could barely start it
<Kencolt> I never liked any Macross other than the original series. Just saying.
<Kandarihu> I'm starting to think Macross Frontier sort of justified the physics of 7.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What's wrong with Macross 7? I've never heard of it.
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome|Busy, 50 episodes of The Power of Rock
<thelonepony> ^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dat LadyCanary O3O
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Then again, I've never heard of Macross either.
<fsadsas> I like how when they talk, all they're mouths do is go up and down
<Sumica> 00,10macross is more or less robotech
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Kandarihu: Haven't seen that either. :D
<LadyCanary> Hiya NewSuperBronyU :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai :3/
<Sumica> 00,10I love how some one comes in makes one comment then leaves
<Kencolt> Sumica: More accurately, Robotech adapts Macross. Then it adapted Super Dimension Calvary Southern Cross (and in the words of one pundit, did what the ortiginal couldn't do-- make Southern Cross Interesting) and then Genisis Climber Mospeada.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02My grandmother was the first one to introduce me to anime :3
<Kandarihu> The original Macross series was the first of three completely unrelated mecha series that were crudely fused into a single abomination called Robotech.
<SlushTheWolf> Sumica Like me?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NewSuperBronyU: What did she introduce you to? :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02My Neighbor Totoro :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ah.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I never saw that.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :$
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: Not crudely. In fact, Tastunoko Studios was incredibly happy with the adaptation.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i don't know you anymore...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> D:
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ;~;

<thelonepony> Bye PonyBean :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Ponies47: O3O I WANNA PLAY DAT
<Kandarihu> Every canon sequel to Macross dealt with the deep space colonization project that Captain Global started at the end of the first series.
<TROctavia> Hey everyone! What's goin on?
<Ponies47> NewSuperBronyU, I know :P
<thelonepony> Hi TROctavia :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I would play as Derpy :3c
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity is where it's at

<SirGanjalf> mmmm food

<Ryunosuke> Twi would be lucario with that super beam of magic :0
<Kandarihu> I'm now two episodes from the end of Frontier and I realize now that Global probably made a huge mistake with that colonization project. I've counted 6 fleets that have either been destroyed or last seen still searching for a planet.
<SirGanjalf> "And with THESE HANDS... I hold the fate of MILLIONS!"
<Kandarihu> And how many successfully colonized worlds? ONE!

<Sumica> 00,10just dont post any youtube videos with gak in the video code =p

<CupcakeWarrior> YES
<AfricanSpy> YES ALL THE YES
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: well my homework is online so id end up involuntarily going back here again >.>

<CrystalPhoenix> can't you just.....log in the site with the browser?
<Sumica> 00,10You can go ahead and stream on site now NewSuperBronyU
<CrystalPhoenix> or does IOS and android not support flash?
*oni_link gives the site a goodbye hug
<CupcakeWarrior> YAY :D
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Sumica: Really? What happened? O.O
<Eddmario> That way if we can't watch the episode when it airs because we're somewhere that we can't watch it on TV and can't visit the site, we can still watch it using the app!
<LunaRoyalGuard> ( 　ﾟ,_ゝﾟ)
<CupcakeWarrior> NewSuperBronyU: Moooo :3
<thelonepony> ohai CupcakeWarrior :)
<J_E_Smith71> NewSuperBronyU: He be eating now
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02CupcakeWarrior: Moo :)
<thelonepony> Moooooooooo :3
<SlushTheWolf> *waves arm around* BYE oni_link!!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well looks like Im eventually going to have to clear out some of my play lists
<Zacklego> link to picture?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02...but the Twitch embed will still be off the site, right?
<CrystalPhoenix> Eddmario, cool idea and all but the question still remains
<CrystalPhoenix> how
*Eddmario needs ideas for machines to make in creative mode of the xbox version of Minecraft
<Zacklego> link to picture?
<Sumica> 00,10No I meen i knew you were already streaming to twich
<J_E_Smith71> NewSuperBronyU: Can't you go back to Mips or Livestream?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> BrawlBRSTMs2 has one strike left, so looks like I will have to clear stuff out in time...
<Eddmario> CrystalPhoenix: Make it sort of like the YouTube app, but allow it to play whatever's streamed, since the Galaxy SIII can't have flash player because Adobe no longer does Flash support for Android devices
<J_E_Smith71> NewSuperBronyU: Or does Twitch work better with WiiU?
<Sumica> 00,10feel free to refresh
<Zacklego> AW COME ON! NO LINK TO PICTURE?
<CupcakeWarrior> o.o
<CupcakeWarrior> why is there a loading screen?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh hello pinkies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does this period of time still allow video links?
<CupcakeWarrior> O.o
<CrystalPhoenix> Eddmario, consider the fact that there's multiple stream service and all stream players needs flash
<CupcakeWarrior> dafuq
<CrystalPhoenix> it will be complicated
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff - Charity Edition
<CrystalPhoenix> more complicated than you're thinking
<CupcakeWarrior> where are the pinkies coming from? :o
<LunaRoyalGuard> ＜(。_。)＞ i give up
<SpeccyRush> to much fun
<CupcakeWarrior> it doesnt help that im sick of this song :/
*SpadeMagnes[R] throws Tom back into the Mirror Pool
<LunaRoyalGuard> (〜￣△￣)〜
<Sumica> 00,10so how about that lack of volume or pause
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> http://derpy.me/QKalf YES. :D
<Zacklego> #derpy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> After watching a playthough of Sonic Before The Sequel, I say its the best representation of a fangame done right
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome|Busy: :D
<Shizuka> 13you can refresh now
<Sumica> 00,10near as we can figure about your twich embed NewSuperBronyU
<Sumica> 00,10Firefox is better then other browsers
<Ponies47> Back
<SpadeMagnes[R]> All hail firefox
<AttackWithHugs> ^
<SpeccyRush> lemme guess sumi the only way to stop it is to popout the embed when thats on to stop it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Says the man who uses chrome right now...
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Busy, Aaaaaah Sssssseaponiezzzz
<CupcakeWarrior> Dawww
<CrystalPhoenix> will there ever be a stream without Alex S?
<Sumica> 00,10or just hit refresh and watch shzu stream SpeccyRush
<LunaRoyalGuard> so true Sumica
<Kandarihu> This song has practically become Phase4's intro music
<Shizuka> 13love winamp eq so much
<AttackWithHugs> Kandarihu, or any Alex S. song
<Kandarihu> Yeah
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: already did that, but I mean if shizu wasn't streaming or something
<Sumica> 00,10it is nice Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10seeing how old winamp is
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how long did it take you guys to make that pinkie intermission screen? 2 hours?
<AttackWithHugs> That's how I know when Phase4 is streaming, even if I'm sleeping
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02J_E_Smith71: Twitch only works on my Capture software
<Shizuka> 13SpadeMagnes[R]: it's a swf from dA somewhere
<Zacklego> WHY IS THE RUM GONE?
<Shizuka> 13just a straight iframe
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Using any other screen capture device creates a delay
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Zacklego: I drank it
<Sumica> 00,10true SpeccyRush but shzu's on mips which has volume and pause
<Eddmario> Sumica: Eyup. Firefox is best internet browser, followed by Opera/Safari/IE, and Chrome is the worst.
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: exactly :P
<LunaRoyalGuard> http://pixelkitties.deviantart.com/#/d5fgg2d
<AttackWithHugs> dat Steam sound
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh come on, Chrome is somewhat better than IE
<CupcakeWarrior> oooh, audiosurf
<Sumica> 00,10well all I know is the twich TV embed issue dont seem to happen to those on firefox
<AttackWithHugs> Hey, it's better than IE 6
<superretroworld> IE for me is faster
<Shizuka> 13hm should i put you through party with pinkie again with surfing? :3
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You cant say IE is good for anything that is better than chrome
<CupcakeWarrior> IE
<AttackWithHugs> Let's all remember Netscape, too
<CupcakeWarrior> And hi shizu
<Sumica> 00,10IE 8 is now better then ever, You can now download othere browses in half the time
<CupcakeWarrior> XD
<Eddmario> SpadeMagnes[R]: It doesn't use all your processing power just to freaking open.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is IE still good for anything besides getting another browser?
<AttackWithHugs> I think there might be an IE 10 coming out...
<Sumica> 00,10dat shizu trolling
<Eddmario> Sumica: You should do the VIP version of this song, on iron mode, with Ninja Mono. See how long you last.
<aniderp> what game is this?
<Sumica> 00,10it's not me any more Eddmario
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does this thing have any video game songs?
<Eddmario> Sumica: Woops, meant Shizuka
<AttackWithHugs> SpadeMagnes[R], going into Windows Explorer for stuff that you normally can't find going into your C: drive
<Sumica> 00,10it's Shizuka playing audio surf
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Indeed: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/321/009/541.jpg
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SpadeMagnes[R]: You upload your own tracks onto the game.
<Sumica> 00,10AttackWithHugs you dont need IE for that
<CrystalPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, that picture makes me sad
<SpadeMagnes[R]> AJIsAwesome|Busy: So I could potentially run Sonic or pokemon songs on this
<Sumica> 00,10any file window can do that
<Eddmario> aniderp: Audiosurf. It's like every other music game, but still unique and it uses your music library to make the tracks
<DerpyMuffins> Wow, Shizuka stream?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SpadeMagnes[R]: Yep.
<DaringDerpy> good morning! :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How much does Audiosurf run for anyway?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yep, DerpyMuffins.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, DaringDerpy. :)
<Ponies47> Hello DaringDerpy :3
<TheRandomkid321> Does anyone have a wii U? If so could you tell me if I should bother seting up online?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> TheRandomkid321: SB does. :
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *:)
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica, I've had to one time. I hate the fact that IE takes like 4 minutes to open and another 3 to show the option to disable add-ons
*Ponies47 Pushes SB towards TheRandomkid321
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Again IE is worst browser
<Eddmario> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/18/4vOtUP1hmE-PSy8KEhGIQg2.gif

<cachi01|Blackcops2> CrystalPhoenix: shizu has :)
<TheRandomkid321> I use safari... *hides behing sheild*
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I would use firefox more if my compuer was decent
<Ryunosuke> Netscape Navigator is best browser :p
<CrystalPhoenix> Eddmario, I mean Beethoven and mozart
<Eddmario> TheRandomkid321: Safari is pretty good actually.
<DaringDerpy> I use mosaic
<Ponies47> My computer is a 2012 model :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Mine is a few years old
<Ryunosuke> I use chrome, but safari isnt bad
<CupcakeWarrior> Love the 240p stream :P
<Eddmario> CrystalPhoenix: Then no, unless you count John Cage's 4'11'
<Eddmario> *4'11"
<CupcakeWarrior> Eddmario: Thats the best song to audiosurf too :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is that vortex at the end,...the end?

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02TheRandomkid321: No universal voice chat system, but there is in certain games. Nintendo Network is free unless you're a minor, which is a $0.50 fee.
<PoniesSleepies47> Idling on TF2. So leaving PC on. Ping me in the middle of the night and I will kill you :3
<J_E_Smith71> NewSuperBronyU: Does that mean no more streams from you at all? Or will you still do YouTube/Netflix stuff?

<DerpyMuffins> You might as well call it Titanic then Sumica
<Cipher> 0,14YES

<Canadian_Brony> Okay, so I was playin' around with Audiosurf the other day, and I tried out Glaze's "She's a Pony" remix. The track was PURE RED!
<SlushTheWolf> It's Nico Nico Douga Kumikyoku.
<[SWAG]Haku> Theyre forcing the main chatacter off of his island, his home for the past year
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What does it being entire red even mean?
<DaringDerpy> http://i.imgur.com/9ERvN.png

<VenHur> Super Mario World!
<Sumica> 00,10tis what got me hooked on niconico
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Needs more mario world
*SpadeMagnes[R] divides by zero
<CrystalPhoenix> DaringDerpy, Applejack is third best pony
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] very, VERY, intense. Warmer the colour, more intense the song. More intensity equals out to flying down the track faster and narrows your FoV
<DaringDerpy> hehe
<Sumica> 00,10you know I might have to import this ship to spaceplanes dir
<DerpyMuffins> Is Shizuka taking request?
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's too large to fit on the launch pad
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sumica: You are getting me excited
<cachi01|Blackcops2> creepyyy
<Canadian_Brony> interesting
<OhShi> 0.0
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Now do a meme song
<SpadeMagnes[R]> for lulz
<CrystalPhoenix> neato
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Dang SpadeMagnes[R], calm yoself
<Shizuka> 13#1 in the world
<Shizuka> 13with a single grey hit
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Wooo Shizuka!
<DerpyMuffins> And 2 miss
<VenHur> Witch Doctor?
<CrystalPhoenix> Shizuka, you want torture?
<Kandarihu> Good job, Shizuka
<CrystalPhoenix> cause that was nothing
<RoboGerbil> do pendulum - fasten your seatbelts
<NocturnalBlade> nice going Shizuka
<LurkerBrony> What game is that?
<Canadian_Brony> Watch out, we got a badass over here!
<Shizuka> 13oh i have tortures
<CrystalPhoenix> http://derpy.me/lH7C2
<CrystalPhoenix> like this?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Do the hardest possible song EVAR
<DerpyMuffins> Do you take request Shizuka?
<Canadian_Brony> LurkerBrony Audiosurf. It is fun and addicting.
<Shizuka> 13did you know eleven minutes of pure silence results in a solid red track
<VenHur> You want torture Shizuka? Play the original Lavender Town!
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Shizuka, how?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Try through fire and the flames
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm wonder if i should make this thing solar or nucular
<Canadian_Brony> wha...
<Shizuka> 13someone mentioned sims
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I want to see the results
<cachi01|Blackcops2> VenHur: ;_;
<VenHur> I dared you, I double dared you, I even TRIPLE dared you!
<Shizuka> 13closest thing i have
<MirrorImage> Sumica - tekkit?
<DaringDerpy> Sumica: nucular!
<Sumica> 00,10KPS MirrorImage
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], that's nothing
<Sp8ers> lol simcity 4
<cachi01|Blackcops2> simcity :3
*Rain sneaks up on Shizuka
<OhShi> :|
<Canadian_Brony> hi Rain
<Sumica> 00,10zomg simcity?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Woah
<CrystalPhoenix> lol simcity 4
<OhShi> dat track
<DerpyMuffins> Can you play some Hatsune Miku after Shizuka?
<Canadian_Brony> this looks . . . eventful
<Sumica> 00,10oh just music
<Rain> hullo Canadian_Brony
*Sumica is sad now
<Sp8ers> CrystalPhoenix: lol I already said that
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what color means what on the track?
<CrystalPhoenix> Sp8ers, so?
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], I think the redder it is the more points you get
*Cipher pats Sumica on the back
<CrystalPhoenix> but the track gets radical on red
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So the redder it gets the harder it is?
<Sp8ers> For Mono, The color indicates intensity of the current song
<Sp8ers> downhill is mostly red/yellow
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This song doesnt look too hard right now...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I suspect it gets worse
<Canadian_Brony> CrystalPhoenix eeyup. More intense = more points. SpadeMagnes[R] more like, warmer the colour. Default colours are purple as least and red as most.
<VenHur> Play Through The Fire and The Flames by Dragonforce.
<cachi01|Blackcops2> pfft
<Sp8ers> VenHur: YES
<AdamTheDuck> Evening everyone. :)
<Rain> that song sucks though
<cachi01|Blackcops2> easy peasy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God I hate being sick, I think I just coughed up some phlem
<cachi01|Blackcops2> Rain: go kill urself pls
<VenHur> Awfully long song = Hardest diffculty?
<Jmo> cachi01|Blackcops2, you should take your own advice.
<Rain> no thanks, I have good taste in music, cachi01|Blackcops2
<thelonepony> Hi AdamTheDuck :)
<Sp8ers> intensity or speed of beat determines difficulty
<cachi01|Blackcops2> Jmo: i already did :3
*AdamTheDuck noms thelonepony :P
<Cipher> 0,14chillax people
*thelonepony licks AdamTheDuck :3
<cachi01|Blackcops2> Rain: yeah? doesnt seem lie
<Canadian_Brony> VenHur not really. You could have a 2-minute piece that absolutely kills you and 8-minute piece that's a walk in the park.
<cachi01|Blackcops2> like*
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This doesnt seem like its hard
<Jmo> cachi01|Blackcops2, keep your opinion to yourself.

<VenHur> I think you doned well.
<mitamaking> Do you want to see Eva 3.0 Shizu
<Canadian_Brony> I find it amusing that I hold the top record for over 1 dozen songs, but only because I'm the only one who plays on them
<Sp8ers> the free tf2 hat? that's the only reason anyone ever buys games
<thelonepony> and wow, i'm so behind

<[SWAG]Haku> Hakus back, and hopefully this time to stay
<cachi01|Blackcops2> SpadeMagnes[R]: what u did thur i c
<CCharmanderK> FUUUUUU
<cachi01|Blackcops2> hi [SWAG]Haku :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats with the trippy race track?
<[SWAG]Haku> hey chachi01
<Prince_Lightstar> Shizuka: need more of a challange
<CCharmanderK> Aaaaaaaaaaand nobodygivesashitthatI'monline. :(
<Canadian_Brony> for some reason, I picture Castelvania
<Sp8ers> ?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Die monster you dont belong in this world
<Prince_Lightstar> any army of pie members on?
<NocturnalBlade> hi CCharmanderK *hug*
<[SWAG]Haku> Hey CCharmanderK sup?
<Sp8ers> castlevania reference FTW
<CCharmanderK> Yay! ^_^
*AssaultWithEmbraces looks around and steals Jmo
<Prince_Lightstar> AppleDash:
<CCharmanderK> I'm doing alright
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why is this track all black and rainbowy?
<Prince_Lightstar> AppleDash: :O
<Jmo> O:
<Sp8ers> in audiosurd, expert mode is usually black
<Sp8ers> surf****
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: black and rainbowy sounds contradictory
<[SWAG]Haku> So I have decided that I now hate my neighbors, and those who have known me for a well enough know I dislike using the word hate, since its such a strong word
<CCharmanderK> VEEEERY random question, but does anybody here watch the anime Smile Precure?
<CCharmanderK> And specifically, did anybody see the most recent episode?
<VenHur> Nope.
<Canadian_Brony> Sp8ers really? I just customize it to have a black background no matter what. You can also change which colours come up at different intensity levels, but I usually keep those at default.
<VenHur> And nope.
<[SWAG]Haku> So the streamer is still playing this game?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how do you get from one side to the other really fast?
<Prince_Lightstar> to long
<Canadian_Brony> CCharmanderK nnope >_>
<cachi01|Blackcops2> SpadeMagnes[R]: movin your mouse
<Sp8ers> well yes, but assuming you leave the backgorund to "auto" it will change based on dofficulty
<SpadeMagnes[R]> SO MUCH PURPLE
<Sp8ers> difficulty***
<Sp8ers> sorry, im eating and typing is hard
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] currently, she's using a mouse, but if you have a keyboard, *S* will get you to the left lane and *D* will put you in the right, no matter which lane you're in. When you let go, you return to the middle lane.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You can't use the arrow keys to move from side to side?
<Prince_Lightstar> Shizuka: are we there yet :3
<Jmo> You can fluffeh
<Canadian_Brony> AssaultWithEmbraces you can. I wouldn't play if you couldn't.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Wooo
<Prince_Lightstar> YES
<Prince_Lightstar> I AM VERY AMMUSED NOW
<Jmo> Good for you.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hey, Jmo. I stolededed youu
<Jmo> I noticed :>
<CCharmanderK> Smile Precure is supposed to be a kids show... and the most recent episode had enough lesbian subtext to make a yuri-shipper cream himself.
<Canadian_Brony> and I threw a muffin at you!
<Prince_Lightstar> Jmo: :|
*Canadian_Brony throws a muffin at AssaultWithEmbraces
<AssaultWithEmbraces> You can't talk unless you gets a special marshmallow pillow thingie
<Jmo> So specific :P

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Argh are you ever going to run out of muffins?!

<Shizuka> 13i wonder if you disabled subtitles if they would still show up for this guy
<Buytoast> what in the hell did that sentence even mean>
<Shizuka> 13i mean you slowly pick up the patterns, like he never says "me" it's always "I and I"
<Pinkies4thWall> Sniping would probably be off by miles, Sumi
<Shizuka> 13i can feel the frames dropping from here
<Shizuka> 13wonder if sumi can see his framerate or not
<SpeccyRush> he can probably feel it Shizuka
<The_Engineer> DAT LAG
<The_Engineer> Hi everybody :)
<Shizuka> 13looks like rendering lag, but then i'm usually on this side of stream latency so i wouldn't really know if this is normal for gta4 streams
<Pinkies4thWall> Yeah, jacob make-a no sunse
<Shizuka> 13could try ffsplit+dxtory like i do
<SpeccyRush> your streams gta4 are stutter free shizu

<Pinkies4thWall> SpeccyRush: are you SpectrumRush?
<p4ngya> the more pink the better :)
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: what i mean is is the stuttering i see your end catching up with the game or just stream being stream?
<SpeccyRush> Pinkies4thWall: yes
<Pinkies4thWall> Ah. got it
<SpeccyRush> and its Spectrum_Rush :P
<Shizuka> 13okay so stream then :3
<Shizuka> 13from here it looks like the engine falls behind and throws in a bunch of smooth frames to catch up, but that's probably actually the stream doing it :)
<Pinkies4thWall> I would change my DA, but that's a premium feature, and i don't has premium. :[
<Pinkies4thWall> Stupid monetary stuff
<Shizuka> 13game doesn't fill view

<Wrek> 05i hope the stream gaps are much shorter now yes? :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: At any rate, I almost never get a complaint from the husband.
<aniderp> im better at baking than cooking
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I've only made bad food once, and that was years ago.
<Gold_Demona> Neither of us could eat it. XP
<MadSurge> CrystalPhoenix: I'd prefer ponified Excel and Hyatt :|
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: theres such thing as bad food?
<Lunac> badness is subjective
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Food that tastes so bad it's not worth keeping.
<aniderp> yes like cheese ravioli
<aniderp> like work had it once.. was aweful
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: noone is good everything.
<Gold_Demona> I like cheese ravioli. :<

<Lunac> Any World of tankers in here?
<aniderp> lyra
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I thought Chef Boyardee was a nickname for a guy who made a silly RPG with Clive Barkley as the protagonist :D
<Bronysith> Wrek: so you like more feral ponies?
<DashWithRainbows> Atryl is the only Anthro artist I can really look up to.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so it's a real thing?
<Wrek> 05atryl is the exception for me
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's a brand of canned pasta
<aniderp> its food
<Wrek> 05casue those anthro's i digg
<DashWithRainbows> Lunac I like that series quite a bit, I need to catch up on the episodes though.
<Wrek> 05also no not feral ones. show ones.
<Lunac> You'll like the new ones :)
<Lunac> Poor Florida..
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: no. Get some uncooked pasta and boil it. Even I can do that!
<Lunac> No GTA4? :(
<DashWithRainbows> Hmmm, I'm trying to remember where I got up to, Lunac.
<Wrek> 05like this:

<Wrek> 05Sumica: ill link you some work later from atryl
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly! The sauce in the Chef Boyardee cans is disgusting. I don't understand how anyone can eat that.
<Lunac> Who will stream next?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: thanks for the tomato sauce America :D
<aniderp> i like them..
<Kandarihu> Wrek, nice
<Gold_Demona> When I make pasta, I boil the stuff myself and season the sauce myself.
<Sumica> 00,10streams clear wrek, have fun
<Alordex> brb, empying bowels
<aniderp> plus the sauce it was in at work.. was horrible tatsing sauce

<aniderp> was like water sauce
<Wrek> 05bit of both
<aniderp> no flavor
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: before the tomato pasta was eaten with cheese and gravy :3
<Lunac> What will you stream Wrek?
<Bronysith> Whenever i cook pasta, i always make my own sauce, Get some italian sausage, cook that up to almost taco like meat, add rosemary, secret seasonings, add garlic, LOTS OF GARLIC let it simmer for a few hours, and my god that sauce is awesome
<Gold_Demona> I love spaghetti with a meaty tomato sauce seasoned with lots of garlic and oregano. :>
<SkunkTari> is this kind of anthro ok Wrek http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=anthro+pony#/d4zm1v3
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, 6 hours \:3/

<aniderp> no spices.. ick
<Lunac> Anthro is wrong for all but trains Awdry style
<aniderp> i think mud would taste better than that food that day
<Bronysith> i like the shows ponies better
<Gold_Demona> What about gargoyles, Wrek? http://fav.me/d3k0ebe
<Bronysith> Anthro is okay on occasion for me >.>
<MadSurge> Ew, garlic :s I can eat that only on pasta with broccoli and anchovy sauce
<SkunkTari> any pony anthro with a bra on only is yuck
<Bronysith> MadSurge: disgusting
<Sumica> 00,10I rather like wreks anthro style
<Lunac> Shame they didn't just use human characters instead of ponies being a fan wouldn't be such a stigma
<MadSurge> Bronysith: less than you'd think
<SpeccyRush> Gold_Demona: Gargoyles you say?... http://derpiboo.ru/45876

<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, nnnope
<naturesfury> ill take the link
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu Cool send it

<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw5683-Scotaloo_Regrets_Nothing.gif
<Rain> its the day that all of the trans people that have been murdered in transphobic attacks are honored and remembered, Deacon
<Alchemist> I have no mouth and I must scream
<Meanwhile> I have no mouth and I must "My life for Aiur!"
<Deacon> Rain ah, taken note of
<Dark_Horst> their whole race is built upon psi engery
<Dark_Horst> they probabyl eat the stuff too
<Alordex> SO telepathic derp-talk
<Alordex> ?
<Dark_Horst> yes
<Meanwhile> Stalkers like it cold. Apparently.
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw2258_medium.png
<Rain> 265 people were murdered this year just because some people couldnt stand seeing them be themselves.
<Dark_Horst> wat?
<Dark_Horst> chat ded?
<Vordox> Dead stuff :P
<Dark_Horst> seems so
<Rain> yup. and those are just the reported ones.
<Deacon> it's hangin in there
<Dark_Horst> Rain: maybe it would help if you'd tell us what the fuck you're talking about
<Dark_Horst> context is a nice thing
<Alordex> ^
<Rain> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/215967_10151277558253281_1098699728_n.jpg
<Rain> I already posted that
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw8007-1347372458561687.gif
<Meanwhile> It probably got lost in the MLFW spam.
<Dark_Horst> oh. it's you again
<Rain> me again?
<Alordex> rain: I have no idea what the fuck that is.
<Alordex> That is all.
<Prince_Lightstar> Meanwhile: http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw6255-images.jpg
<Meanwhile> Prince_Lightstar: That image is probably true every day of your life.
<Rain> its the anual day where all of the people killed in transphobic attacks are honored and remembered
<Prince_Lightstar> Meanwhile: http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw2433_medium.jpg
<Alordex> >transphobic
<Alordex> Ok one moment
<wipergone2> who is streaming
<Rain> the fear of transgendered people
<Meanwhile> Wrek's streaming.
<Dark_Horst> advice: dont discuss anyhting wiht that guy. he will do his darndest to describe you as a transgender hating blodhungry beast
<wipergone2> how can u tell
<Dark_Horst> we already had that
<Rain> that girl*
<Dark_Horst> that girl
<Jmo> Wait, so people who get murdered cause they're transgender all get remembered on one day, but people in general don't get a day like that?
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3228-LET_GO_OF_YOUR_HAT.jpg
<Jmo> What makes them so different from a normal person?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Tons of New Merch on Welovefine
<Vordox> Lwl Zeratuul is fat XD
<Dark_Horst> Jmo: nice, isnt it?
<Rain> I like this guy Jmo
<Jmo> I'm not hating on transgender at all either.
<Rain> I know :D
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw7939-tumblr_ma5mijxhy51rcjmu8o1_500.gif
<Rain> you're asking what makes us so different from normal people. thats what I like
<Rain> we arent different, but people like to treat us like we are :3
*Venus 08,01sneaks up on Uncouth and stealthily hugs
<Vordox> That went to hell XD
<Jmo> There is nothing different. You're the same as every person, just with a different persspective.
<Jmo> perspective*
<Jmo> And if people think you're different cause you don't fit their perspective, fuck them.
<Meanwhile> Banelings, because it wasn't bad enough when they just ate your face, now they have to explode in a shower of acidic guts.
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw5366_medium.jpg
<Rain> I really like you Jmo
<Venus> 08,01Jmo: people can observe whatever they want
<Uncouth> oh, I have been huged!
<wipergone2> me too
<Jmo> They can, but if they're going to observe negative they should keep it to themselves.
<Meanwhile> hugged*
<Rain> now the reason we do this TDoR day, Jmo, is because of the way it happens..
<Venus> 08,01if i want to observe left-handed pansexual cellist twin day of rememberance, i can
<Uncouth> right, hugged :)
<Jmo> Fuck the society of today, so wrong.
<Dark_Horst> if you want to be seen as equals, you should not ask for special days
<Venus> 08,01so show some goddamn respect for those who want to observe transgender rememberance day
<Dark_Horst> just saying
<Venus> 08,01it's their fucking prerogativee
<Rain> Dark_Horst, so like veterans day?
<Venus> 08,01if you don't want to celebrate it, that's yours
<Jmo> Of course Venus.
<Venus> 08,01but don't be such a drama llama about it
<Vordox> Ded
<Prince_Lightstar> http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw1741-1319403477.jpg
<Dark_Horst> Rain: personally, i dont really care for that. i'm not american
<Venus> 08,01</rant>
<Meanwhile> Zeratul, why would you run in there like a lemon? You're a rogue, not a paladin.
<Jmo> ima evel nointey paradin
<Rain> also its more to raise awareness that it happens
<Rain> a lot
<Venus> 08,01Meanwhile: battlerogue of death
<Venus> 08,01DPS rogue
<Dark_Horst> i rember the last time you treid to raise awareness. we were aware after the first 5 minutes but you kept on for half an hour. throwing around groundless accusations
<Meanwhile> Combat rogue was not built to tank. (No matter how many times I was expected to tank tentacles in Heroic Dragon Soul)
<Jmo> Ahahahaha DS
<Meanwhile> Ikr?
<Rain> groundless? http://lexiecannes.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/trans-woman-sues-u-s-govt-over-tasering-by-park-ranger/
<Venus> 08,01Meanwhile: i can out-DPS a fair few equal level palies with my rogue
<Venus> 08,01do i mean palies... no, i think i mean mages
<Meanwhile> A pure dps class can outperform a hybrid. Who'da thought it.
<Dark_Horst> yes, groundless. as in accusing people in here for being intolerant fucks for no reason
<Venus> 08,01honestly, it's been ages since i've played WoW
<Meanwhile> Lies, no one can outdps mages. Not since they were reduced to 3 button arcane rotations.
<Dark_Horst> if an accusation is made towards someone without any reason, that is a groundless accusation
<Venus> 08,01Dark_Horst: maybe it's because some people in here are intolerant fucks...
<Jmo> I've tried several times to return to WoW, tis just too boring.
<Dark_Horst> it's also very insulting
<Dark_Horst> Venus: true. but i didnt see any of those the last time
<Venus> 08,01oh! speaking of intolerant fucks, it's time for another episode of Shit My Mother Says
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Rain> no no, I didnt acuse you of being intolerant fucks. I said if a bully is beating someone and you dont even tell someone about it or try to stop it, you are as bad as the bully
<Venus> 08,01"i have nothing against gays, so long as they stay away from me and my family"
<Alchemist> question: would intolerant fucks stop to be intolerant fucks by "raising awareness"?
<Dark_Horst> probably not
<Lil_B> does anyone know of the top of their hat, if Celesta said in S3 E1 if they defeated King Sombra "1000 Years ago" or "over 1000 years ago" or "thousands of years ago" ?
<Venus> 08,01Alchemist: depends on their motive. i they're raising awareness so that they can get together a lynch mob...
<Rain> didnt call you intolerant fucks and yes actually.
<Venus> 08,01*if
<Alchemist> Rain: I know you didnt, Im just running along with the term someone else mentioned to make my point. Sorry.
<Dark_Horst> and that'S what i mean. i complain about being groundlessly accused, which did happen, and then i get a report thrown at me that is supposed to justify said accusation towards me?
<Dark_Horst> sorry, but no
<Rain> I didnt accuse you.
<Dark_Horst> logic does not work that way
<Dark_Horst> you did
<Meanwhile> This is getting silly.
<Dark_Horst> not today
<Rain> ok then
<Venus> 08,01oh, another gem: "i think gays should just stick to their own community"; also: "what use are gays to society? they can't reproduce."
<Rain> Im not accusing you now
<Rain> how about that?
<Meanwhile> What with the whole running in circles for the past 5 minutes.
<Alchemist> When did Saturn turn into Venus btw?
<Venus> 08,01she also thinks "it" is the appropriate transgender pronoun...
<Dark_Horst> doesnt help that you did. so yeah, my attitude towars you just might be a bit negatively influenced because of that
*Rain shrugs
<Rain> what ever. I tried
<Rain> if it helps, I appologise for the statement I cant remember
<Venus> 08,01i don't know whether to laugh, cry, break shit, or all of the above
<Rain> about the things your mom says, Venus?
<Venus> 08,01yes
<Rain> you should contest her, because all of what she is saying is crap
<Dark_Horst> it also seems she's repeating the most commonly used phrases
<Lil_B> Venus or "I'm, fine with Gays unless they reproduce"
<Venus> 08,01it's really actually starting to get to me
<Venus> 08,01it never really did before
<Alchemist> Venus: Im sorry to say this, but it doesnt seem you can do much about it.
<Lil_B> is this Starcraft 2?
<Dark_Horst> it is
<Rain> Im trying to find the link that lists off 20 of the people that died and how
<Rain> one of them had her throat slit and her face sliced up with a knife.
<Lil_B> ... I never played iut, but it kinda looks like Warcraft 3 with better grafics
<Rain> Thats the kind of thing this day is trying to bring awareness too
<Venus> 08,01Rain: as a reasonable, logical, and cogent member of the human race, it's hard to argue with someone who i'm pretty sure actually has no brain
<Venus> 08,01just a simple nervous system that knows how to make curry
<Venus> 08,01take that, darwin.
<Rain> lol
<Dark_Horst> hope the curry is good at least
<Meanwhile> The cheese?
<Rain> anyway, all that woman did to get her face slashed and her throat cut, was exist. which is fucked up
<Meanwhile> Oh the chieves.
<Venus> 08,01only when she makes it with ingredients that aren't 3 years out of date
<Venus> 08,01and that's just the meat
<Alchemist> Rain: sad thing is, you dont even have to be transgender/gay whatever else for this to happen to you. Just be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
<Rain> yes, but imagine using a public restroom
<Venus> 08,01Alchemist: but being transgender/gay helps
<Rain> and getting your ass kicked for it
<Alchemist> Venus: it can...
<Rain> just being afraid to go to the bathroom, or walk down the street
<Venus> 08,01but also, a big killer of transpeople is suicide
<Rain> yeah
<Alchemist> I have been jumped for no reason and Im as bland and average as it gets.
<Venus> 08,01there's a reason why it's called gender dysphoria.
<Rain> the attempt rate is 41% of the trans population
<Rain> the general population of everybody? 6%
<Venus> 08,01i mean, being trans is a dificult lifestyle choice
<Venus> 08,01just like AIDS.
<Alchemist> Venus: lifestyle CHOICE :D
<wipergone2> poor choice wrek
<Meanwhile> Tosh > Nova.
<Rain> Alchemist, he said choice and then said AIDS
<Rain> which means its not a choice
<Alchemist> Rain: I know, thats why Im laughing
<Venus> 08,01Alchemist: that was a reductio ad absurdum comment
<Meanwhile> Wasn't reductio a spell in Harry Potter?
<Alchemist> Venus: i know
<Venus> 08,01ah, okay
<Lil_B> Venus can you call the London Philarmonic and tell them that their version of One-Winged-Angel in " The Greatest Video Game Music 2" sounded rather unspecial and that this song has been done countless times anyway?
<Venus> 08,01Lil_B: next time i'm on the phone to their booking manager, i'll mention it
<Lil_B> thanks :P
<Invi> hay Lil_B ^^
<Rain> oh, found that link
<Lil_B> hey Invi :3
<wipergone2> wrek
<Rain> Venus, may I post this link?
<wipergone2> r u downloading planet side 2 on steam
<Venus> 08,01Rain: pm it me first
<Meanwhile> Wrek why don't you mindblast or whatever it's called?
<naturesfury> i think he only has 89ish energy
<Alchemist> watching stream instead of studying is sooo satisfying right now.
<Alchemist> but it wont be for much longer...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hello folks

<Meanwhile> Alchemist: Bummer.
<Alchemist> something: I didnt have much either, they stil managed to steal my shoes :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I remember seeing a tag on a piece of luggage that said "Nothing worth stealing here"
<Alchemist> I wonder how much that helps
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Knowing how assholish the people of america are....not much
<Alchemist> Maybe put another tag inside that reads "Told ya!"
<Moopy> Morning bronystate
<Alchemist> Hi Moopy !
<something> this game sucks by
<OmegaSlayan> morning Moopy
<Moopy> eeyup
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Moopy :3
<Deacon> allo moobull69
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Watching a game and playing a game can be different experiences
<Deacon> er... Moopy
<Moopy> Heheh
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It can be fun playing a game, but watching said game can be boring as fuck
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] then does that mean letsplays are equally as boring?
<Moopy> so when i just got on why is the pony server being so slow today?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I said it can be boring and besides, some letsplays make it interesting to watch
<moobull69> hello
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Whoops
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai moobull69 :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Multi kill!
<moobull69> it is quiet this afternoon

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Besides I like ponies but streaming nothing but that might get tiresome after a while
<powny> :(
<Deacon> wasn't that also th3e second rule as well?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Dare I say this, you can only have so much pony
<MLP_Brovakiin> powny: Read the FAQs, it explains it there :3
<powny> ok what game is it?
<Lil_B> Deacon nope, 2nd rule is Bacon
<Rain> so, Dark_Horst. I appologise for being really angry last time I was talking about this topic. its a sensitive one for me and someone compaired it to liking an unpopular music genre so I got pretty iritated..
<Invi> hmm... bacon isn't number 1?
<Invi> I call blasphemy Lil_B
<naturesfury> Wrek: dont u mean jamacian empire?

<MadSurge> Ohai VenHur!
<Lil_B> One Bad Apple is the Episodes name? I expect Touhou Music
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dun get it
<Invi> the name reminds of a drawing of Wrek...
<Deacon> watch touhou "bad apple"
<moobull69> I wonder if bad apple will have a thanksgiving theme?
<Deacon> probably not
<Deacon> but who knoes?
<moobull69> true, I didn't see a christmas present themed ep
<Invi> what about heart warming eve?
<IshSadPony> ohai dere everypony

<MadSurge> Hey IshSadPony!
*IshSadPony is sad :(
<Lil_B> hi IshSadPony
<Deacon> how come ish? :(
<IshSadPony> Deacon I was playing OOT3D, and my next task is....is......the water temple *bursts into tearS*
<moobull69> OOH S2E11
<Deacon> oh god, I know how you feel :(
<SpeccyRush> oh please
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Everyone makes the water temple harder than it really is sometimes <.<
<SpeccyRush> the water temple is easy
<SpeccyRush> even more so in the 3ds version
*SpeccyRush kids today
<SpadeMagnes[School]> More so in the Master Quest version
<moobull69> ^this, it took me some time but I didn't consider the water temple to be uber hard
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Some how the game that is supposed to make the dungeons harder, made the water temple easier
<SpadeMagnes[School]> HOW DOES THAT WORK
<Lil_B> thanks to the Nintendo Magazine, I got through the Water Temple, but as a KLid I could not get to the Forrest Temple, it was so goddamn scary
<Lil_B> btw, does anyone know of Celestia at the beginning of the Primere. They defeated King Sombra "1000 years ","over 1000 years" or "thousands of years" ago? I forgot
<Lil_B> if*
<Lasharus> I think it was 1000 years ago.
<Lasharus> I.e. Celestia had a REALLY busy year a millennium ago.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Then how the hell was luna around then?
<Lil_B> ^
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] that why I'm asking
<Lasharus> This is what one calls 'overthinking' :P
<Lasharus> If you want to push it:
<Invi> maybe nightmare moon worked with sombra and discord
<Lasharus> "Luna was influenced by the banishing of the then evil Crystal Empire, and subsequently her mind turned evil."
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also why are all these evil gods from 1000 years ago, why 1000? that seems so arbitrary
<Invi> and sombra is just a bit late
<Lasharus> There you go, fanfic-ish explanation.
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] why do spells last until midnight? it's just a trope
<Lil_B> unless I'm mistaken with what she said, we got a rather clear logical flaw here
<Lasharus> Oh no.
<Lasharus> A logical flaw in a cartoon for children? :P
<Deacon> Lasharus better stop the presses
<MadSurge> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Lasharus: Its kind of a large plot hole
<Lil_B> Lasharus shaddup, I like finding flaws :P
<Invi> Lil_B, what if Sombras curse was delayed for some time
<Lasharus> Cue laughter.
<Lasharus> All right, here's another explanation.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Luna was banished 1000 years ago so how the fuck did she help defeat sombra
<Lasharus> If it was EXACTLY 1000 years to the day on the season premiere?
<wipergone2> 52 min till launch
<Meanwhile> Not even marauders match my accent!
<Deacon> maybe it was 999 years ago?
<Lasharus> Then Luna was banished a little later.
<Lasharus> Just say "okay, a thousand years, give or take a decade"
<Lasharus> There you go, plot hole insulant applied.
<moobull69> Plot hole!
<MadSurge> Lasharus: yeah, that's what I thoughy
<MadSurge> *t
<Lasharus> Does take away from the significance of the 1000 years PRECISELY, but whatever.
<Lil_B> Lasharus well, they describet rather clearly that the banishing of Nightmarew Moon was 1000 years ago by the day Twilight came to Ponyville
<Lasharus> Also, thank you moobull69. SOMEONE had to...
<Lasharus> Astonishing, Lil_B. Then the Crystal Empire was 1010 years.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why is 1000 years such a arbitray number for unholy evil?
<Invi> or 1001
<Lasharus> I mean, really, it's a plothole that is designed to be filled up by approximately 5000 fanfic-writers. Done.
<Lil_B> Lasharus Yeah I takle that, still I like the error :P
<Lasharus> If indeed it's an error.
<Lasharus> I'd call it 'overthinking it. Massively.'
<wipergone2> how twlilght sparkle discoved ponyville
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Lasharus: Well its kind of a massive plot hole
<Lasharus> But then, I'm a cynic.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good morning everyone
<Lasharus> No it's not.
<Deacon> SpadeMagnes[School] actually it's 917, but 1000 sounds more fitting
<Lasharus> They never explicitly stated the Crystal Empire was PRECISELY 1000 years.
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] because they can't say "666 years ago" in a kids show :P
<moobull69> if lauren faust was still doing *almost* everything this plot hole may not have happened :P
<Lasharus> But a millennium ago is fine if it's about 900-1100 years ago.
<Lil_B> Lasharus say said the banishing weas 1000 years ago
<Deacon> morning TGaPT
<Lasharus> So done. Plot hole insulated.
<Lasharus> What, of Luna or the Empire?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im calling it now the next villian was some evill banished for 1000 years since they seem so obsessed with that number
<Lil_B> Lasharus actuallly, both
<Lasharus> Neat.
<Lasharus> Then they contradicted themselves, or Celestia's memory's a bit foggy. She HAS been alive for at least a millennium, probably several.
<Lasharus> I stand by the fact that, yes, it may be a plothole, but is it a big deal? Sorry, but no.
<wipergone2> dafuw
<wipergone2> dafuq
<Dark_Horst> so, 48 minutes til planetside
<Dark_Horst> gah
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im gonna give my theory
<Rocket> hello hi AHOY!
<Lil_B> Lasharus I never sdaid it's a big Plothole, I care about it that much -><-
<Deacon> lali-ho Rocket
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sombra got banished than later luna's banishment happened
<Lasharus> I know Lil_B, but I'm also responding to SpadeMagnes[School], who DID say that. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Discord...somewhere inbetween maybe
<Rocket> oh my gawd it's star craft!!!!~~~!
<Lasharus> Was Discord mentioned with a millennium as well?
<Lasharus> I thought he was just 'from a distant past'.
<Deacon> nope, jsut banished
<moobull69> is dat sum star craft? :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He said he was turned to stone I think 1000 years ago... I think
<wipergone2> yea
<Lil_B> Lasharus no, Discord was dated as prior to Nightmare Moon
<Lasharus> Then Discord could be anywhere, as long as it's more than a millennium ago.
<Lasharus> Going by all of this, I think '1000 years' is not THAT overused.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still question the logic of keeping a god of chaos in your garden where it could freely escape
<Rocket> xD
<Lasharus> We've had four 'major villains'. Yes, 50% could be argued, but really, on a focus group of four, that doesn't really make much of a point. :P
<Deacon> I'm gonna bet whenever a writer goes on a panel, some fan is gonna ask about sombra and luna 1000 years thing
<wipergone2> it cant rly
<wipergone2> turned to stone
<Lil_B> Lasharus I just remember the argumenting after the Crhistmas Carol Episode, where they discussed "how can Ponyville have been founded like this, if Discord rules the Land before Luna and Celestia came?"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yea...Discord,Luna and Celestia are mentioned no where in that story at all
<moobull69> I think I missed that ep
*LadyCanary peeks into chat.
<Lil_B> ohai LadyCanary
<Lasharus> People just overanalyse. I tend to just enjoy the series for what it is, and let the issues on that level... eh, I just ignore ´em.
<LadyCanary> Hiya.
<Lasharus> It happens, yes, but meh.
<wipergone2> 44 :D
<LadyCanary> Wait a second.
<Deacon> yo canary
<LadyCanary> THIS IS A WREKY STREAM ISNT IT
<Malavolent> Evening everbrony.
<Deacon> mmhmm
<Meanwhile> Inb4 Planetside 2 servers break because of surge in numbers.
<Deacon> lali-ho Malavolent
<LadyCanary> :D My love!!!!!!!!!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still say the issue saying Luna was banished 1000 years ago and sayign she helped banish Sombra 1000 years ago with out specifying what happened when seems like a plot hole but eh
<wipergone2> lool
<Rocket> robo fetish xD
<PaRappaTheRapper> lol
<LadyCanary> O U
<wipergone2> wrek
<Lasharus> Yeah, but asking for specifics in this thing is really, it seems, our thing. The cartoon itself couldn't really care less, I rather suspect. :P
<Deacon> I got the best theory to explain it all: it's a kid's show
<wipergone2> is this game any good
*LadyCanary nuzzles Wreky :3
<moobull69> I heard the orig planetside was kinda disappointing
<Rocket> SpadeMagnes[School] oh its just an show, just watch it xD
<Lasharus> That's what I just said, Deacon. Just with more words. :P
<Deacon> wipergone2 it's been used with many LAN parties, I guess so
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know its just a show but it still seem slike a massive contradiction to the whole story
<Lasharus> ORBITAL COMMAND, you daft bugger!
<Lasharus> Yes, but we've got about three tidbits of 'overarching story', to be fair.
<Lasharus> 90% of it is standalone.
<PaRappaTheRapper> So, im late to join. what are we doing?
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] don't worry, We'll place a rug above the that Plothole and everythiung will look fine
<Moopy> Well when i just came back from the living room i saw the chat stoped going
<Deacon> lali-ho PaRappaTheRapper
<LadyCanary> Wrek playing the first Planetside I think.
<LadyCanary> Wait... Deacon= Dken?!
<PaRappaTheRapper> Deacon: What?
<Deacon> PaRappaTheRapper dwarven greeting
<LadyCanary> Thats his way of saying hello
<Deacon> LadyCanary and yes ;)
<PaRappaTheRapper> Deacon: oh.
<LadyCanary> :O Oh!
<Dark_Horst> she'S pretty
<moobull69> actually planetside got an 81 on metacritic, thats not toooo bad
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Do I even want to guess what IGN gave it?
<naturesfury> robo and alien fetish***
<Meanwhile> He's dead Jim.
<moobull69> ign gave it 77 :/
<LadyCanary> >caring about IGN reviews.
<LadyCanary> I stopped listening to IGN's bullshit a long time ago.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You cant spell Ignorant with out IGN
<moobull69> well maxim gave it a 100
<Lasharus> Someone listens to IGN these days? :P
<Vivix> I've never read a review in my life
<Vivix> ever
<Vivix> with the exception of a magazine article about half life 1
<Lasharus> Listen to Zero Punctuation.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If it isnt Call of Duty it sucks, is their viewpoint
<Vivix> not even he's right
<moobull69> vivix, how do u make informed purchases then???
<Lasharus> Take that with a pinch of salt, and you've got a fairly accurate view. :P
<Lil_B> IGN ... I never visit that site unless I wanna read about Secreats or Walkthroughts
<Vivix> I buy what looks nice
<Meanwhile> IGN review things? I thought they sold ratings.
<Jmo> Oh discussion about money eating reviewers.
<Jmo> Woo.
<LadyCanary> Exactly SpadeMagnes[School]
<Vivix> Reviews aren't interesting when it comes to books, music, games or art
<LadyCanary> If you wanna play the game, then play it.
<Lasharus> Not exactly, Vivix.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You've got mail!
<LadyCanary> Reviews shouldnt dictate how you play.
<Vivix> That's my opinion, anyway
<Lasharus> They are interesting when it comes to REALLY BAD games, etc.
<Rocket> i have starcraft, but i m such a big BIG big noob :C
<LadyCanary> Shit, they gave Alice Madness Returns a shit review and did I care? No! Did I dislike the game? Hell yes.
<Lasharus> Reviewers aren't paid very well anyway, so if they have to go through something atrocious, they tend to tear it to pieces. Which is often amusing to read. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Loading why are we still loading
<Rocket> loading an loading files
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My view point is this, I dont judge a game from what people say, I play it my self first
<Vivix> There's only one game I regret not reading a review about, and that is stronghold 3
*LadyCanary giggles.
<Vivix> because it didn't even work for like 50% of the players
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Unless the game is Sonic 06 or Super Man 64
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Then you can judge it regardless
<LadyCanary> SHHHHH
<Lasharus> Apparently they fixed that one a fair bit Vivix.
<LadyCanary> We dont talk about that :|
<Lasharus> Sonic 2006?
<Lasharus> Oh yes I do.
<Vivix> They might have, it still doesn't start to me, but I got a free gold-version , so maybe htat one works
<Lasharus> I'm a Robotnik/Eggman fan. I can't avoid hating on that piece of *bleep*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Captian Mcgolden nipples
<LadyCanary> FANBOYYYYY
<Lasharus> Most definitely, LadyCanary. I wear the emblem with pride.
<Lil_B> Vivix I know that feel... Pr-Ordered it...
<Lasharus> Alongside the logo of the Eggman Empire, of course.
<LadyCanary> ...Well then Lasharus. *cocks shotgun* TO THE BACK WITH YOU
<Lasharus> "The Eggman Empire - Get a load of this!"
<PaRappaTheRapper> Guys i joined late. What is going on?
<Invi> nuhthing
<Vivix> Lil_B, ouuch
<Lasharus> Erm, LadyCanary? If we're going into random RP territory I'm busting out the Egg Dragoon II :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Pingas
<Lil_B> Vivix Stronghold 3 was so bad when it came out, and now after I played the Gold Version... It didn't improved much, it's broken in the very core
<Lasharus> And I may have to slap you, SpadeMagnes[School].
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> Just another boring tuesday
<Vivix> still? aww.
<Vivix> It didn't even get past the splash screen to me, never got to boot it up
<pony_8089> is there any lottery survey up yet? Said it's up Monday-Thursday, but nothing yet
<LadyCanary> Nah, Im joking aaround Lasharus
<LadyCanary> And pony_8089, patience.
<Lasharus> As am I, but I"m a git. :P
<Lil_B> Vivix it worked alöways for me, but the Gameplay, Bugs, and everything is just horrible
<Lasharus> (Must be said though, the Egg Dragoon II looks brilliant, if you've ever played Sonic Generations)
<Vivix> aah
<pony_8089> I guess it's not up then - I was simply curious if it wasn't showing for me :-)
<Vivix> Yeah I read about it while trying to fix it, missing actions <,< buugs--oh my
<Lasharus> Damnit, LadyCanary, it's no fun fanboying if you won't respond.
<LadyCanary> Heh.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh Egg Emperor, you so pathetic
<Lasharus> That's Sonic Heroes.
<LadyCanary> Oh god.
<Lasharus> And technically, that wasn't Robotnik.
<Lasharus> :P
<PaRappaTheRapper> Well, my freind just msged me on skype. Probably going soon to play minecraft with him. Maybe.'
<LadyCanary> I actually enjoyed playing 2 player VS Sonic Heroes.
<Lil_B> Vivix the Menue feels like it's made in Flash, the Mechanics are worthless, the Building is stupid, I sspent 49€ on Stronghold 1... because Preorder Bonus... and it's the english version and I already own the german version ... sorry, but this game more than anything was a stab in the heart for me
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Egg emperor was in Generations actually
<moobull69> Catechumen
<Lasharus> Only the DS version, SpadeMagnes[School].
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well the 3ds version anyway....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still say Nega Wisp Armro should have been the modern era boss
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *Armor
<naturesfury> scvs dead jim
<Lasharus> Here.
<Lasharus> Prepare for a massive image.
<Lasharus> http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120402101825/sonic/images/a/af/Egg-dragoon-sonic-generations.png
<Lil_B> The Egg Emprerror also was in Heroes... which I actually liked...
<LadyCanary> Jesus.
<Vivix> Lil_B, yeah- that seemed to be the general feel. I mean- it was just so broken that people felt cheated. And they never fixed it properly?
<Vivix> It's just icky
<Lasharus> It's a tad more impressive than the Egg Emperor, I feel :P
<Lasharus> See what I mean when I say I like the design of that thing, LadyCanary? :P
<LadyCanary> Yes..
<LadyCanary> o3o
<PaRappaTheRapper> Lasharus: That is quite huge but I zoomed out
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I sure love blasting His World fighting that thing
<Lasharus> I have an "Ask Dr. Robotnik" thread, and someone actually asked me: "Do you like giant mecha?"
<Lil_B> Vivix no, but I gave up on playing it, they would hva eto make it completly new :/
<Vivix> yeah-
<Lasharus> I just linked to that image, saying "look carefully, you MIGHT find me in there."
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Boy I would love dlc to fight more Robotnik bosses or more stages
<Meanwhile> "hard and fast"
<Lasharus> I'd be up for that, SpadeMagnes[School]. :P
<Lasharus> Say what you like about Robotnik - silly, always loses, but by god does he know how to build a mech. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The Dreamcast era boss for 3ds makes no sense regarding Sonic never fought it
<Lasharus> Which one was that? I didn't play the 3DS one.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Bio lizard
<PoX> Am i the only one around here?
<moobull69> This nice chicken outside gave me this coupon: https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353432430076.jpg
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And one stage was radical highway, shadow's stage
<Lil_B> I still wanna know hwere Eggman gets all the Metal from...
<Lasharus> That IS sort of silly.
<Lasharus> It's a skill, Lil_B.
<Lil_B> I mean... dat damn Air-Fleet in Sonic Heroes...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He gets his funding from the government
<Rocket> omg what have i done to the paintchat ;_;
<Lasharus> And in Sonic Unleashed.
<Lasharus> And... well, most other ones.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He's secretly the vice president
<Lasharus> SpadeMagnes[School] - in one game he actually runs "Robotnik Corp"
<Lasharus> It's as if people WANT to be taken over.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still say one robotniks early comptent designs was the lava reef machine
<Lasharus> Shame it was self-defeating. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He would have won if he stopped firing mines
<Lasharus> Anyway, I think I'm over-fanboying again.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello?
<LadyCanary> LOL
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Zerg rush? Kekekeke?
<Lasharus> Be nice, LadyCanary.
*Lil_B watching Watership Down "Holy Damn"

<Jmo> Why did that trip in my mind as female.
<LadyCanary> Mooo :3
<Sylandest> LadyCanary: Look, look with your special eyes
<Jmo> Whatever damn gender you are.
<Meanwhile> Eh?

<Disguise> Am I gonna have to slap a -blam!-?

<Jmo> FAK
<prince-dari> Ok, give me a minute

<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo> You figure it out for yourself.
<Meanwhile> ...

<Lasharus> You don't much like explanations, do you? :P
<Pinkies4thWall> !cd
<Tom> Episode 4 of season 3 "One Bad Apple" airs in 3 days, 21 hours, 49 minutes, 48 seconds (Nov 24 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Jmo> I'll explain when it is worthy.
<Lasharus> Translation: When I damn well want to and it doesn't seem silly.
<Lasharus> Yes, I'm still a git.
<MLP_Brovakiin-> Yeah sorry it is doing it now to, my internet is playing up... :|
<Deacon> ok, turns out I don't have to watch my cousins, back
<Lasharus> That's nice. :)
<Jmo> WHO is this person?
<Lasharus> For the fans of the Sonic Comic series - the head of intelligence.
<Lasharus> (Archie comics, that is)
<Lasharus> Doubt there're many, but hey, I can try.
<LadyCanary> I like Archie comics :3
<Lasharus> Whoo!
<Rocket> What is this big monster whih pissing at building with green maze ?
<Jmo> Who the hell gave you candy and kool-aid for the sugar rush.
<Lasharus> Actually, I hate the Archie comics, but the sonic series the company does isn't too bad, LadyCanary. :P
<Deacon> I wanted to read those comics, but I heard there was so much confusing plot points
<LadyCanary> Welcome to Planetside, Rocket
<Lasharus> Oh yes, it's about as logical as a concrete octopus, Deacon. :P
<LadyCanary> Oh yeah, Lasharus xD
<Lasharus> kool-aid? I'm not in the US. I prefer a nice cup of Earl Grey, thank you.
<LadyCanary> ...Also, you remind me a lot of this dude from my school. He's a pretty big Sonic fanboy as well.
<Jmo> Oh god Netherlands, really?
<LadyCanary> inb4 you are him
<Lasharus> ROBOTNIK Fanboy.
<Lasharus> Important difference there.
<LadyCanary> Oh :o
<Lasharus> And yes, I'm from the Netherlands. I speak more English than Dutch though.
<Rocket> stop fanboying here or i'll turn on my engines
<Lasharus> That's super.
<prince-dari> MLP_Brovakiin: When did you get banned?
<MLP_Brovakiin1> prince-dari: I am really sorry for wasting your time, I'll come back when my internet is better, sorry :(
<prince-dari> I don't see you in the bans list
<LadyCanary> Vroom vroom
<Rave|Class> Back, what did i miss?
*Rocket fires engine
<Sp8ers> you missed a lot
<RaveBrony> :L
<Sp8ers> I feel bad for you
<Lasharus> A lot of randomosity, RaveBrony.
<RaveBrony> Nooo D:
<MLP_Brovakiin1> prince-dari: I don't know, I try and join and it says 'Cannot join channel (+b) - you are banned'
<Lasharus> There was some fanboying, an utterly silly discussion after that, and so on.
<RaveBrony> Ah, im sure there will be plenty more throughout the day, lol
<naturesfury> RaveBrony: also a trout fight
<RaveBrony> Hah, good ole Bronystate
<Meanwhile> Not enough minerals.
<prince-dari> When did you last join IRC without being banned?
<Deacon> lali-ho RaveBrony
<MLP_Brovakiin1> like an hour ago?
<RaveBrony> Hey Deacon :)
<MLP_Brovakiin1> when I got in from school I tried :S
<MLP_Brovakiin1> it let me in then
<Lil_B> ok ... scrap Watership down "Felidea" is awesome : D
<prince-dari> An hour ago?
<prince-dari> No bans have been set on the channel for 5 hours
<MLP_Brovakiin1> about that, yeah
<MLP_Brovakiin1> Oh :/
<prince-dari> And I don't see you on the bans list
<Lasharus> Anyway, I think I'll just go sit back and have dinner, what with my urge to silly discourse being over with for the day.
<MLP_Brovakiin1> I really don't know what is happening
<RaveBrony> You enjoy that, Lasharus :P
<Lasharus> Oh definitely.
<MLP_Brovakiin> It might just be my internet, it is being changed over this week so I am on one of the BT open zones, might that effect it
<Lasharus> But since I work in customer service these days, my brain does need the occasional break.
<Lasharus> "So I paid tuition fees. When do I get them back?"

<Lasharus> "...um... you don't?" "WHAT!? I'LL LEVEL A COMPLAINT AT YOU!"
<prince-dari> You ghosting yourself
<RaveBrony> LOL
<Kandarihu> Planetside 2 unlocks in 12 minutes. What are the chances that Wrek is gonna start trying to download it in that time?
<Lasharus> (actually happened)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh, I am not sure :S
<MLP_Brovakiin> I might try again later when I have a stabe connection, thanks for your time prince-dari :)
<RaveBrony> I got to intern at a computer helpdesk last spring xD
<Lasharus> Or, of course:
<prince-dari> Try joining now
<Lasharus> "So, your education, is it HBO, MBO, or University? (Dutch terminology)" "Yes!"
<MLP_Brovakiin> Nope :S
<RaveBrony> "Uhhm, my computer doesnt turn on, i pressed the button and nothing happens"..... "Did you plug it in?"......."Oh..."
<Lasharus> Sometimes I wish I could slap people through my mic.
<MLP_Brovakiin> sorry...
<Lasharus> That one's always a classic. :P
<RaveBrony> Ikr?
<Lasharus> "So, the loan, I don't have to pay that back, right?"
<prince-dari> Huh
<prince-dari> I don't understand that
<RaveBrony> Hahaha, wut
<Lasharus> Yeah. That one was quite interesting to manage.
<Kandarihu> You know what? Maybe I'm cut out for that line of work.
<otakon> heya Wrek long time no stream man!
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am on one of the open zone internet connections, could that be it?
<Deacon> lali-ho otakon
<otakon> BLOW UP ALL THE BUGS! YEAAAAAAAAH!
<Lasharus> "So, can I apply for low-income additional funding?" "Lemme check" *looks into parent's income* "Your dad makes 350.000 a year. How about no."
<otakon> Deacon: why no more Dken?
<RaveBrony> Hey there, otakon!
<otakon> hiya RaveBrony
<Deacon> otakon felt like it
<Meanwhile> But Zerg are so cute. :<
<Lasharus> Hey Otakon.
<RaveBrony> Kandarihu: Try it, all you have to do is have patience
<LadyCanary> Of course you would think that Meanwhile
<otakon> Meanwhile: you and prince-dari think the Giant Weta is cute(which it is)
<MLP_Brovakiin-> Look prince-dari, I am sorry for wasting your time, it is annoying me now so I am going to go... sorry :S
<otakon> Shizuschlafen is asleep
<otakon> Post Giant Weta pics :P
<Lasharus> In fairness btw, the call center I'm at is governmental, so quality is relatively higher, and the callers aren't ALL blithering idiots. Which is superb quality, compared to commercial call centers. :P
<prince-dari> Don't worry about it
<Meanwhile> They aaaaarrreeee. Look at their cute little mouths with their cute little teeth and their big tendrils of drool. <3
<MLP_Brovakiin-> I bet it is my connection, but thanks anyways :)
<prince-dari> I'll ask around about it
<Kandarihu> RaveBrony, and a self-repairing heart to help people who don't know what they're talking about but think they do.
<Venus> 08,01mmm, tail call recursion
*Venus 08,01drools
<LadyCanary> I wouldnt be surprised if you found headcrabs cute Meanwhile
<MLP_Brovakiin-> thanks :)
<Venus> 08,01is it wrong that i find recursion a turn on?
<Meanwhile> Those're cute too. See how they scuttle.
<RaveBrony> Those that call helpdesk are insanely uneducated....
<RaveBrony> for computers anyway
<otakon> Venus: okay why are you suddenly Venus?
<Lasharus> Well, I work at the ministry of education, RaveBrony. I suppose SOME education is involved, mostly. :P
<LadyCanary> I like whacking them with my crobar. It's like playing baseball :3
<RaveBrony> Kandarihu: Indeed, lol
<Venus> 08,01otakon: because i'm Venus
<RaveBrony> Lasharus: Yeah :P
<Meanwhile> Plus, whenever they jump I can't help but hear "HUG MEEEEEEEE"
<LadyCanary> Sailor Venus! :3
<otakon> Venus: but you're not the Roman Goddess of Love dammit!
<otakon> VenHur: you're a six foot hairy half Indian Scotsman!
<Deacon> who says he isn't?
<LadyCanary> Maybe you'd like to find out otakon? ;33333
<otakon> no
<otakon> no I would not
*LadyCanary giggles
<RaveBrony> Hah
<otakon> how many times I gotta say it! I DON'T LIKE GUYS
<Lasharus> So tempting to hug you now.
<SpeccyRush> otakon: ya tabfailed hard there
<RaveBrony> A little bit
*Venus 08,01licks otakon
<otakon> crap I did
<otakon> sorry VenHur

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: You Now Have a Mirror Pool
<RaveBrony> :o
<Disguised> It's 7 in the afternoon and he got dinner first now?
<powny> then i will watch Pownys the Anthology 2
<Kandarihu> So I guess this means that Wrek is now the second mod to brand his streams, right?
<Rocket> my brand!
<Kandarihu> Shizuka = Cathedral Zero Productions : Wrek = The Wrek Sessions
<Venus> 08,01hmm
<Kandarihu> http://store.steampowered.com/app/218230/ Alright guys! PS2 is ready to go!
<RaveBrony> I suppose
<Kandarihu> So those of you whose computers can handle it, GOGOGOGOGOGO!
<powny> i would make over 2 mio clones and make a army
<RaveBrony> Kandarihu: It wont let me download it! Lmao
<Venus> 08,01i wonder if i can confuse GCC with a recursive call to a static inline function...
<naturesfury> huh isent letting me dl it
<RaveBrony> Same...
<naturesfury> says no subscription?
<Kandarihu> Oh right. That's to be expected. This is the way games ALWAYS come out on Steam. The download becomes possible a few hours after the Play Game button appear
<RaveBrony> Nah, its just not doing anything :I
<RaveBrony> Darn
<Kandarihu> There's always http://www.planetside2.com/

<RaveBrony> Guess its TF2 until it dies down :I
<Kandarihu> And you know what? My computer can't handle this game. Whenever I tried launching the beta, it took a quick look at my GPU and said "Nnnope"
<Rocket> emm guys, what do you know about Mic ? coz i enjoy his music, and then i heard that he had some altercations with some people :X
<RaveBrony> Mic?
<Rocket> micthemicropheno ofc :D
<RaveBrony> Oh, i dont listen to brony music that much :I
<RaveBrony> Doesnt interest me.
<Rocket> :(
<RaveBrony> I prefer older techno and trance :P
<Rocket> i liked his music, and he was one whih bring me to this whole MLP :P
<naturesfury> gahhhh this is so annoying
<Rocket> what ? :O

<Vivix> and download region
<Vivix> Mines set to sweden, apparently
<Wrek> 05as is mine :3
<Vivix> woo
<Invi> Vivix, so... theoretically could I download the english fallout new vegas version with a german key?
<Alordex> And what do you mean set it to shift servers
<Vivix> I--don't think so
<RaveBrony> Sweet! Downloading <3
<Chrysalis> Wrek can you not update planetside from the beta to the release?
<Invi> aw
<Vivix> you download your version, I suppose, just from another server

<Vivix> Alordex, just change to another country,t osee if that wants to download
<Alordex> k
<Alordex> Country, or city in USA?
<Alordex> Does it matter?
<Vivix> Don't think so, just something else and hope it's not full
<Vivix> if you choose something really far away, it might be slower, but yeah, that's about it I guess
<Sonny> Heya everbrony

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Deacon and MLP_Brovakiin!
<LadyCanary> Hiya Everlasting_Joy
<Everlasting_Joy> Hello LadyCanary!
<Meanwhile> 'Lo Everlasting_Joy.
<Wrek> 05but yeah
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Meanwhile!
<Wrek> 05facign 20 years for taking photographs is beyond ridiculus
<Vivix> it's a common law
<naturesfury> brb going to area 51
<RaveBrony> Wow :L
<RaveBrony> Oh hey, Everlasting_Joy :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy RaveBrony!
<naturesfury> so how did u come across this anyways?
<naturesfury> u know em?
<Vivix> arma3 developers
<RaveBrony> Probably on the news
<Vivix> it was all over the net when they got arrested, especially in the arma fandom
<Vivix> unless these are two other guys who took illegal pictures of army-bases
<naturesfury> dem hippies
<RaveBrony> What do i put in the 'message' section?
<Vivix> ofcourse it's way too harsh with 20 years, but smashing their cameras and shipping them out? That would make sense
<LadyCanary> I dont think you have to put anything in there, RaveBrony.
*thelonepony sneaks into chat >.>
<Invi> RaveBrony, you write in there what you think about all that
<LadyCanary> It's optional.
<Invi> hay thelonepony
<naturesfury> i could understand a hefty fine 2 but ya any long jail time is dumb
<thelonepony> Hi Invi :)
<Vivix> especially in this case
*Ryunosuke glomps LadyCanary
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Greece is full of bullshit, what Espionage could they have been doing,
<Vivix> jail time would make sense if they were employed by another country, as spies,
<Vivix> but they weren't
*LadyCanary is glomped.
<LadyCanary> Oi
<Vivix> SpadeMagnes[School], if you take a camera to an army base, you'll find out
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya thelonepony :)
<Ryunosuke> heya, hows you?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<thelonepony> Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :)
<thelonepony> :3
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy thelonepony!
<thelonepony> Hi Everlasting_Joy :)
<Kandarihu> Well, I tried using the Steam "Play Game" button for Planetside 2, and it's working now. So go ahead guys. Planetside 2 can now be downloaded from Steam.
<Meanwhile> Just about every variation of download is fussy atm.
<LadyCanary> If only I could get Planetside 2 to work on my laptop >w<
<LadyCanary> >_>*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well first of all, isnt Greece bankrupt? What could they fucking possibly have worth sending "spies" to preform Espionage
<Vivix> You do know they are guilty of espionage in some degree, right?
<Vivix> It's not a question of if, it's a question of "do they deserve that punishment, when etc"
<RaveBrony> :L
<naturesfury> good thing america dosent doo any of that stuff.
<Vivix> They probably do
<Vivix> I can't imagine a country that would let you take pictures of their army bases
<naturesfury> im american i theres no dout in my mind they do
<LadyCanary> =__=
<Vivix> I mean, 20 years is too much when they're not actually spies, but noone would let you leave with the camera
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why were they taking photos to begin with?
<RaveBrony> Hmm
<Vivix> Well, first they said it was for the game
<Vivix> then they said it was a vacation
<Vivix> and now I have no idea what they're saying
<naturesfury> is it a military prison or maxium or low security
<OmegaSlayan> woops forgot i had this open, going to head out, need a nap didnt sleep well last night
<Vivix> no idea~~
<thelonepony> Night OmegaSlayan :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ok if they found they had no "spy" equipment on them, how do they have any hold on this case? They clearly didnt have any espionage gear with them
<Vivix> waht the hell?
<naturesfury> camera?
<Vivix> They had a camera, that's enough
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That stuff is easily obtainable though
<Vivix> taking picture of 'secret bases' or military things, is illegal
<Vivix> they took pictures, they were arrested
<powny> hmm no stream
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well if it was illegal why did they do it in the first place?
<Punkie_Pue> What are we talking about?
<Wrek> 05casue all millitary stuff is in the backround out of focus
<Vivix> maybe they didn't know, maybe they didn't think it was a big deal
<naturesfury> were all dl'ing planetside right now powny
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Thats kinda asking for trouble
<Wrek> 05there are bases close to the airports in geece even
<Wrek> 05takign an image on the airport of your family on vacation
<Wrek> 05and you are likely to snap a jetfighter in the backround
<LadyCanary> Huh.
<Vivix> huh
<Everlasting_Joy> Weird.
<Wrek> 05but the whole situation is very muddy anyways
<Vivix> I heard they were on the island, taking pictures for inspiration for the game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So if its all out of focus how the shit is any of this case justified?
<Vivix> then changed their story after arrest
<Wrek> 05as i said
<Wrek> 05its muddy
<Wrek> 05as hell
<Vivix> yeah-
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know what? Fuck greece
<Vivix> i don't know if it's justified, but I think 20 years is way too much when the circumstances are what theyseeem to be
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Kandarihu> Well even if they don't willingly release these guys, we can't expect this situation to be anything remotely the same 20 years from now.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And if these guys were monitoring them the moment they got on the island, why didnt they stop them then?
<Wrek> 05takign close up images wont give oyu anythign anyways
<Wrek> 05GPS adn sattelites, even google already know
<Vivix> google did get in trouble over that, but mostly with regimes
<LadyCanary> So let them sue Google :P
<Vivix> like--myanmar
<Vivix> and china-
<LadyCanary> Maybe that'll solve their issues.
<Wrek> 05pfft
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And regardless if its illegeal or not what the shit could Greece POSSIBLY have that is worth sending "spies"
<Vivix> I think it's fine, army should be allowed to censor air-iamges
<Deacon> dang google, always getting away with stuff :P
<Wrek> 05who would want to know anythign about greece millitary
<Wrek> 05they're broke
<MadSurge> Hello LadyCanary! How are you? :)
<Vivix> doesn't matter what it's worth
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Last I heard they are bankrupt
<SpadeMagnes[School]> so sending spies would be pointless
<Vivix> and that does not change anything
<LadyCanary> Alright.
<Wrek> 05jsut saying
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: :D
<Wrek> 05apple should buy greece
<LadyCanary> True.
<Wrek> 05and start with iCheese
<Vivix> Hehehe
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Even if it is illegeal, you wouldent get shit out of the event
<Wrek> 05iGoat
<Vivix> Still illegal
<Wrek> 05and OLiVE
<naturesfury> -.(\
<Invi> thr first icountry ^^
<Vivix> soon, iEurope
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Vivix: Regardless spying would only be worth it if they fucking had something
<LadyCanary> OOPAH!
<Vivix> doesn't change anything SpadeMagnes[School]
<LadyCanary> O U Wrek
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yea I know but again, they wouldent send spies unless Greece had something worth spying on...
<Vivix> probably not
<Everlasting_Joy> Vivix: Than, iWorld.
<Meanwhile> If they did it's not likely to be common knowledge is it.
<Vivix> AWw Yeah, next after that? iMoon
<Vivix> There probably ar spies in every country
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But Greece is broke, what the fuck could their military even have
<LadyCanary> Or maybe iTwinkies. Oh wait.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I doubt Greece has nukes lying around in the base
<Vivix> iHorse and iHuman
<Wrek> 05irobot
<Wrek> 05OMG
<LadyCanary> I DID NAWT MURDER HIM
<MadSurge> EETS BOOLSHET EETS NAHT TROO
<LadyCanary> What is it Wrek?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh hi mark
<Venus> 08,01I DID NAAAAAAAAAT
<Vivix> Haha--oh man, that's the only meme that makes me laugh almost every time
<Wrek> 05it onyl first now struck me that iRobot is an apple reference
<LadyCanary> ....
<MadSurge> Suuuuure
<LadyCanary> Oh my god.
<soulrider95> Wrek: it isn't......
<SpadeMagnes[School]> DUN DUN DUN

<soulrider95> Yeah the movie is based on the book, which was around before apple.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I robot, U robot

<MadSurge> I Robot existed well before Apple did
<otakon> from an Isaac Asimov novel
<naturesfury> i know what movie im suggesting this week
<LadyCanary> ....
<Wrek> 05that doesnt matter really
<otakon> hell Asimov came up with the 3 laws didn't he?
<MadSurge> ^
<Venus> 08,01Wrek: you know it was "based" on an Asimov book from 1950, right?

<otakon> Bc it's actually a pretty good movie
<Wrek> 05that wasnt
<Wrek> 05waht i was "questioning" as it were
<Vivix> When you love a book, you hide from the movie
<MadSurge> Venus: it's in name only too
<Wrek> 05udnerstandable saturn
<naturesfury> i love harry potter books and i watched the movies...
<Wrek> 05but its still a good movie ^_^
<Vivix> same- actually
<Vivix> LoTR too
<Alchemist> The IRobot movie didnt do the books any justice imo.
<Wrek> 05which is what worries me about bilbo
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wumbo
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Changing planets are we?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> 1...2...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> 3...
<Vivix> cue Spock singing Bilbo
<Wrek> 05bilbo was probably my first voluntary read
<Vivix> Ooh~~
<Wrek> 05so with the movie close
<Wrek> 05ermegerd
<Vivix> Well, LoTR movies did, in most cases, do the book justice- hopefully same can be said for the hobbit
<Wrek> 05right
<Vivix> hoepfully
<Wrek> 05the titled it the hobbit
<naturesfury> ive seen a summery for the hobbit. its was meh
<Wrek> 05not bilbo
<Vivix> Hobbiten it was called in Norwegian, the book
<Wrek> 05w/e
<Alchemist> Im worried that it will be a 3 parter...
<soulrider95> It is a 3 parter
<Vivix> it will be, I think they said so
<Alchemist> seems unnecessarily long
<Vivix> perhaps, it is a massive journey- we'll see
<soulrider95> they are adding stuff from other books, not just the hobbit.
<Vivix> Simlarilion?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: In A Tavern, Down By The River
<soulrider95> yeah
<Alchemist> Im guessing by other books you mean the silmarils
<Vivix> jeesus teach me how to spell ktxh
<Vivix> I wonder why Peter Jackson did so well
<Vivix> look at his track-record of splatter movies

<Prince_Lightstar> it sema like there is no stream

<Vivix> oh Lord, I tried to read Silmarillion, it was like reading the appendix in LoTR
<Wrek> 05there will be a stream once this is finished downloading
<Wrek> 05that i can guarantee
<naturesfury> what u at btw wrek
<Wrek> 05if its me streamign or not
<MadSurge> Vivix: I like that he tried to worldbuild, but TOO MANY NAMES O_O

<Vivix> Kiss greeting, seen that many times

<Lil_B> Alchemist did someone ever said to you in the Laboratory, "Here hold this, I need to wash my hands" gives you a flask and you feel that there was some kind of solution around it that you now got all over your hands as well?
