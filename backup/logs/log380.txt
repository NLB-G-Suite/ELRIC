<MirrorImage> oh... fancy that, it IS trixie eating a pinecone in hell http://muffinsforever.deviantart.com/art/Fancy-Trixie-eats-a-pine-cone-in-Hell-286102943
<SlurryMoon> 3Hey there TOY_PON3|Homework
<Cavy> Yes, I am being abducted.
<TOY_PON3|Homework> mfw I posted that yesterday
<Meanwhile> dari abducts young boys, canon.
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile - except Arnold is the one riding shotgun
<Cavy> We proved so much stuff canon a while back.
<MirrorImage> *ba dum tish*
<Meanwhile> Cavy: we did?
<Cavy> We discovered that Equestria has petroleum, bears live in the sky, and a few other things that slip my mind.
<Saturn> 08,01i was singing Smile on the bus earlier
<Saturn> 08,01it was epic
<Saturn> 08,01the whole bus joined in
<Meanwhile> http://derpy.me/H7zpZ
<Cavy> Sounds epic Saturn.
<Cavy> Lies.
<MirrorImage> Cavy - but how can bears play seashells in the sky?
<Meanwhile> Saturn: believed you 'till that last bit.
<StinkomanFan> I'm going to go work on something EPIC
<Saturn> 08,01well, that's what happened in my mind!
<bartsonic> saturn: lucky
<StinkomanFan> Tell ya'll later
<bartsonic> oh wow lol
<Saturn> 08,01in reality, i penguined
<CupcakeWarrior> "Today is the day I kick your butt all the way to Celestia!"
<Cavy> Not sure, MirrorImage. All we know is that the Ursa Minor lived in a cave, and it was a constellation. If constellations live in caves, bears must live in the sky.
<Capn_fisty> i once sang smile smile smile quite loud thinking nopony was in, turns out mu mum had the day off work
<Cavy> Canon/
<Capn_fisty> my*

<Cavy> If you copypasta it works.
<CupcakeWarrior> Cavy: 0_0
<kidzrul434> NO IT IS NOT! SHIPPING PONIES ARE LIKE RULE 34
*kirzstryfe prepares to rull MirrorImage out the door
<Meanwhile> Shipping ponies is like rule 34. Sounds legit.
<DWR_Food> >Shipping ponies >Rule34...
<Cavy> Anyway, I never really liked shipping between the mane 6. Not like I'm against it or anything, just...It never really appealed to me.
<TOY_PON3|Homework> I guess..
<DeadlyDerp3> :'(
<DWR_Food> Pretty sure there is a LARGE difference.
<CupcakeWarrior> If shipping was 34, then most of fimfiction is rated M
<Cavy> I've chosen one that I can enjoy, but other than that I don't really write or read much shipping.
<DWR_Food> ^
<DWR_Food> THIS.
<TOY_PON3|Homework> Okay define rule 34 ship...
<TOY_PON3|Homework> Define it now
<Meanwhile> Well shipping is like love and R34 is like sex.
*Meanwhile shrugpony
<TOY_PON3|Homework> Exactly
<Cavy> Rule34 is Hentai. Shipping is Romance. Romance is not Sex.
<Cavy> Just saying.
<Cavy> Not entirely, anyway.
<Cavy> It can be.
<DWR_Drawing> Oooo..
<Krakass> Sweet
<TOY_PON3|Homework> Must...watch!

<Cavy> >NoReally
<CK|Asleep> Krakass: Changing times, what?
<Krakass> CK|Asleep, that was sarcasm.
<CK|Asleep> I see. Sarcasm doesn't tend to project well in text. I saw that and was like "waitwut"
<Cavy> I wouldn't think anyone would actually believe that.
<alexxm> tom is wrestling john cena
<CK|Asleep> wut

<Jaketehsnake> CountDoofus, Up for any Left 4 Dead?
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<CountDoofus> sure
<[SWAG]thehated5689> but of course
<alexxm> so is there a stream
<CupcakeWarrior> Nope, Rainbow Dash is best pony
<Cavy> Rainbow Dash is best pony.
<Cavy> FINAL.

<Meanwhile> Nope.
<CK|Asleep> Cavy: I should have understood it, have been here long enough. I'm just....a tad exhausted....
<mario_pony> fluttershy is best pony
<Meanwhile> Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Cavy> That's alright, CK|Asleep ^.^ We're all buddies here.
<CK|Asleep> (and by that I mean that teaching tends to drain me of all semblance of energy during weekdays >.<)
<CountDoofus> it's all subjective. my favorite is Fluttershy, and favorite background pony is Vinyl Scratch
<Jaketehsnake> Anybody else up for Left 4 Dead>
<Krakass> That AJ recolor needs a different hat.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> she wears clothes?
<Meanwhile> Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
<Cavy> I've liked Dash before I was a brony.
<Cavy> Strange, eh?
<CupcakeWarrior> Meanwhile: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5oSPpmfuz8
<Meanwhile> There it is.
<mario_pony> Krakass: what is a recolor?
<CountDoofus> Jaketehsnake: 1 or 2?
<Jaketehsnake> I only have 2

<CriticKitten> Man, isn't that game done yet? ._.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> Ok, best Zombie game: Left 4 dead, Killing floor, or Dead island?
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: hopefully it'll be wirth the weight.
<mario_pony> L4D
*CupcakeWarrior wishes there was an mlp dating sim
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> plants vz zombies
<CriticKitten> I feel like I've been waiting for it for years. Though maybe that's just because I actually HAVE been waiting for GW2 for years and some of that anticipation has been boiling over into other games.
<Krakass> GW2?
<CountDoofus> I liked Dead Island, never played Killing Floor, L4D is awesome (if team is good). So L4D for me
<Meanwhile> Waiting, foreeeeeveeeeer.
<Cavy> People still asking for them to play as different ponies...MEANWHILE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN: Livestream begins at 8PM. THIS IS NOT LIVE!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> fffoooooorrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeerrrrr
<mario_pony> this one time in band camp......
<Jaketehsnake> Thehated, I prefer Killing Floor for instathrills but L4D for building a good team and playing for srs
<Cavy> ^TrueJake
<Jaketehsnake> Yup
<Meanwhile> I haven't played L4D properly in forever.
<mario_pony> Cavy: what stream?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> L4D is now a bronystate approvedd Zombie Game

<Cavy> I would if I had it with me.
<Cavy> =P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't own L4D
<Cavy> Unless you mean on PC.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> only have it on xbox
<Meanwhile> Xbox?
*Meanwhile spits.
<CupcakeWarrior> I dont do PC gaming
<Jaketehsnake> I got it on sale for 5 XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i do have killing floor but i'm new to it so i'm really bad
<Jaketehsnake> PC gaming is afar superior to Xboc
<Cavy> Nah.
<Cavy> Depends on what games though.
<mario_pony> why haven't they finished fluttershy yet?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> omg let the flame wars begin
<CupcakeWarrior> PS3>Xbox 360
<Cavy> Nope.
<Jaketehsnake> TheGreatandPowerfulT I got it 5 dasys ago XD Lemme know If you want a friend to learn with!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> yes, but my laptop is not up for gaming, i still need a decent one
<CriticKitten> Krakass: Guild Wars 2. I'll refrain from doing my usual excited fanboi stuff though.
<CriticKitten> :p
<CountDoofus> nooooooo... don't go there...
<[SWAG]thehated5689> PC> ALL the consoles!
<Krakass> Ahh, ok.
<Jaketehsnake> Ok, PC gaming is superior on decent hardware
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i got it to in that sale, add me :p
<Jaketehsnake> Same steam name?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<Cavy> Xbox360=PS3. They're both great consoles. If you're a FPS guy, get an Xbox. If you like racing/Spots, get a PS3. Xbox tends to be more competitive in FPS.
<Cavy> Again, both good at what they do.
<MahBoi777> hmmmm yes quite
<Jaketehsnake> Send trixie
<Cavy> <Has both. Bought them myself.
<Jaketehsnake> Sent*
<CountDoofus> I got an XBox, but there's nothing stopping me from getting a PS3
<CountDoofus> other than an empty wallet
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> cheerilee jack or berry punchjack ._.
<Jaketehsnake> Jackie Chan
<Jaketehsnake> XD
<Cavy> I just happen to prefer the EC for Xbox 360. Between Halo, Gears, etc.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol
<[SWAG]thehated5689> i had a ps3, broke after 2 weeks, have a xbox after a year+
<Meanwhile> Yfw I just added a bunch of you on steam.

<Meanwhile> Do check, and if I didn't add you don't worruy, it just means I don't like you as much.
<Jaketehsnake> Meanwhile, Tis an honor to be your steam friend :P
<MahBoi777> Cavy, u like Bioshock?
<Cavy> I thought GoW was pretty good. I played Dante, though.
<Cavy> <3 MahBoi777.

<Cavy> I like Toby's LITERAL Bioshock.
<Meanwhile> CountDoofus: Oh yes.
<Jaketehsnake> Bye bye Thehated
<PinkiePieCopy> You mean...
<PinkiePieCopy> TOBYTURNER?
<Meanwhile> Even if it isn't being released on Steam ¬_¬

<Jaketehsnake> CountDoofus and I are up for a L4D campaign. Anyone else?
<Jaketehsnake> DONT LOOK DOWN DONT LOOK DOWN
<otakon> CountDoofus: it's two days relax
<Cavy> You're lucky theres a blimp..
*PinkiePieCopy looks down
<PinkiePieCopy> SHIT
*Jaketehsnake well F***
<CountDoofus> I am relaxed
<CupcakeWarrior> Why cant I lookdown?
<Jaketehsnake> AHHHHHHH
<Meanwhile> I can try Jaketehsnake but my connection to valve servers is sometimes unreasonable.
<MahBoi777> lol
<otakon> CountDoofus: it's still another 2 weeks roughly anyway
<CountDoofus> *bottles up rage* relaxed...
<mario_pony> CountDoofus: what does the US get on the 6th?
<Jaketehsnake> Meanwhile, I played a campaign on a server with 3 euros yesterday., Had a pong of 260. XD We can still try
<CountDoofus> heck, I can occupy myself in the meantime
<Krakass> mario_pony, Mass Effect 3
<CountDoofus> still playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
<mario_pony> what's it about?
<mario_pony> mass effect
<Meanwhile> Jaketehsnake: it's prone to connecting to a map, killing my connection during transition to the next, and then faffing around with my net while I try to make it play again.
<CountDoofus> a super sentient race comes over to wipe out all living things in the galaxy
<Krakass> ^ That
<mario_pony> is it hard?
<Meanwhile> Ah yes, "Reapers" The race of sentient starships allegedly waiting in dark space. We have dismissed that claim.
<Jaketehsnake> Meanwhile, Faffing around, that doesn't sound good. You should start the game so it picks the best server for your connection
<MahBoi777> hello Reapers, lol
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56l8dWqgags

<Meanwhile> It might be less fruity if I join the game from the start.
<Jaketehsnake> "You can fight like a Krogan, run like a leopardBut you'll never be better than Commander Shepard" XD
<Meanwhile> Commander Shepard is best Shepard.

<Saturn> 08,01*cough*#stupidsexytwilight*cough*
<emangamer|physics> well everypony I'm off to study
<Jaegerpony> http://fav.me/d4qiyyk <-- may the best girl win
<emangamer|physics> ping me if you need me
<CupcakeWarrior> 10 days is too long
*emangamer|physics huggles his silly filly SlurryMoon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well i'm going to take a shower, see ya later guys~
<Jaegerpony> waves
*SlurryMoon huggles emangamer, the silliest of the fillies.
<mario_pony> otakon: i gave up all i'm gonna do is put up a screen saver
<Paradise92> Jaegerpony i started to scream while reading the lyrics...and it is all thanks to Yaplap
<emangamer|physics> SlurryMoon: but...I'm the silliest... SuperBrony64 is
<emangamer|physics> SlurryMoon: I'm the physical....ist of the fillies
<Dark_Horst> no more streaming tonight?
<Jaegerpony> Yaplap?
<otakon> mario_pony: try disconnecting the wire and setting it up wireless
<otakon> Dark_Horst: not atm
<SlurryMoon> 3x3
<otakon> hiya SlurryMoon what's up?
<Dark_Horst> that's kinda why i ask
<SlurryMoon> 3Yes you are emangamer|physics, yes you are.
<SlurryMoon> 3Hai otakon
<mario_pony> otakon: i do and it still won't work
<PartyCannon> a wild SlurryMoon appears
<SlurryMoon> 3Nothing much
<Jaegerpony> reverse paypal?
<emangamer|physics> o/ my approving glace is what fillies seek o/
<otakon> mario_pony: are you setting everything to automatic?
*emangamer|physics projects his wub with a velocity of 22 m/s at a degree of 1/8 pi radians towards SlurryMoon
<SlurryMoon> 3Cool maths
<emangamer|physics> assume no wind resistance
*SlurryMoon does something equal, but opposite to emangamer|physics
<CupcakeWarrior> Fancy mathematics are fancy
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: what are you physicsing?
*kirzstryfe starts a glomp pile on CupcakeWarrior
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Glomp PILE!
<emangamer|physics> SlurryMoon: I wub woo so BUCKING Much
<Jaegerpony> was tempted to buy the Vestax VCI 300 MKII today
<mario_pony> otakon: yeah why?
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: umm...magnatism currently
*CupcakeWarrior is glomped
*SlurryMoon glomps emangamer|physics
<otakon> mario_pony: just checking
<SlurryMoon> 3x3
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: you spelled it wrong, good start! :P
<CrossChop114> Hi. :/
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: IKR???
<Jaegerpony> but will it work with Traktor?
<otakon> mario_pony: once again, try to go through the automatic setup process
*emangamer|physics loves SlurryMoon with all of his blood pump
<CrossChop114> Nothing streaming?
<Jaegerpony> nope
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: remember, jerk off rule (unless you're left handed)
<Jaegerpony> Please wait whilst we deal with technical difficulties?
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: LOLOL...which one... there are 3
<Krakass> Steven_Magnets, how do they work?
<Jaegerpony> finally looks up lapyap
<Jaegerpony> aah LDAP
<CupcakeWarrior> yaplap has best singing voice
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: figuring out the force upon a current, the direction of the field due to a current, and the direction of flux upon a solenoid
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: there's just one. make a hand like you're manipulating a cylindrical object with your right hand. your fingers are the B-field lines if the... "vector" coming out of the end is current
<otakon> does ANYONE know how to help mario_pony with his problem?
<Jaegerpony> has issues with acronyms
<Saturn> 08,01this is for conventional current
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: current through a magnetic field*
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<otakon> mario_pony: are you sure all the ports on your router are open atm?
<Saturn> 08,01jerk off rule.
*Paradise92 prepares his throat for yelling....
<mario_pony> otakon: yep
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: there are THREE jerk off rules I've leraned
<otakon> mario_pony: then it should be connecting
<Jaegerpony> streaming is a bugger
<Krakass> mario_pony, can you check on the router to see if the ps3 is actually connecting to it?
<otakon> it's not
<otakon> that's the problem
*Paradise92 STARTS TO YELL!!!
*mario_pony is confused
<Saturn> 08,01Jaegerpony: i'm sure people who aren't from bulgaria can also stream
<Jaegerpony> LOL
<Zappy> *closes ears*
<Krakass> You don't have mac address filtering turned on do you?
<Paradise92> NOW, RAINBOW MY DEAR I CANNOT EXPRESS MY DELIGHT!!!
<Saturn> 08,01Krakass: what's a mac address?
<Paradise92> IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR
<mario_pony> Krakass: .........
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: what is the magnitude of the force per meter of length on a straight wire carrying an 8.40A current when perpendicular to a .9T uniform magnetic field?
<Paradise92> THAT SOMEWHERE OUT HERE
<Paradise92> IS THE PET THAT WILL SUIT YOU JUST RIGHT!!!
<mario_pony> Krakass: whuuu??
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Paradise92...
<Krakass> Media Access Control
<Jaegerpony> It IS one of his best songs in the serieses
<Paradise92> kirzstryfe i am just copy paste words from yaplap version of the song
<Krakass> Its a way to prohibit devices from connecting to a wireless router
<kirzstryfe> 1,3is that the guy that screams all the songs into his mic?
<Paradise92> yup :D
<Paradise92> now as i was yelling
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yeah, not a fan :p
<mario_pony> oh i guess my computer says it has it enabled
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: dear lord, it's years since i've done this...
<Jaegerpony> There is a karaoke version on Youtube with the lyrics muted down
<Saturn> 08,01okay, going off the top of my head...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yelling =/= music
<CupcakeWarrior> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeOYJO-jFGs& best yaplap
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: F=BILsin(theta) right?
<Paradise92> dammit...
<Paradise92> party pooper
<Saturn> 08,01F_B = qv * B, right?
<Paradise92> no one likes a party pooper
<Paradise92> party pooper
<Paradise92> party pooper that is you
<Krakass> If your router has it enabled then you need to put the mac address of the ps3 into the list of allowed devices.
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: right, yeah, i was just about to derive that
*Vinyl turns on cloak~
<kidzrul434> sorry bronies I'll be watching glee tonight
<CupcakeWarrior> lol Glee
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: you're doing it the hard way...(bowchickawowwow)
<Jaegerpony> aaah I see - shouty songs
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: i always do, oh baby, oh baby
<Paradise92> TO SEE
<Paradise92> TO FIND
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: dat rocos modern life reference
<Paradise92> TO SELL
<Jaegerpony> we should hire him for strepsils adverts
<Paradise92> -AAAH
<mario_pony> Krakass: i'll try
<Saturn> 08,01but seriously, i'd never remember formulae; i'd just derive them if i needed
<Saturn> 08,01or look them up
<Saturn> 08,01obviously, you can't look them up in an exam
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: whats the units of a tesla?
<Paradise92> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UelcmN8mFQ&feature=related
<Paradise92> destroy this
<Paradise92> link
<Paradise92> AT ONCE!
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: tesla is a unit
<Saturn> 08,01of... magnetic flux desnity
<Saturn> 08,01one weber per metre sqAURE, if i remember correctly
<Jaegerpony> wow I think that broke my subwoofer
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: I know...but just like ohms can be broken up... what can tesla be broken
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: no that flux...
*CupcakeWarrior ignores science
<Paradise92> Saturn Nikola Tesla a briliant Serbian Scientist...*proud to be Serbian*
<Jaegerpony> like pinkie ignores the 4th wall?
<spiritwaffle> hi guys :)
<Jaegerpony> oh we LOVE tesla - stuff edison
<Saturn> 08,01Paradise92: yes, he is my lover from another... timeline?
<Zappy> Hello spiritwaffle
<Paradise92> Saturn you know Dr.Hooves?
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: what about then the current passes through at a 45 degree angle
<spiritwaffle> :P
<Krakass> DC > AC
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: then you just plug it into that equation; also, weber is flux, tesla is flux density
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: no...flux is field lines / meter squared
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, the cahnge in flux
<Paradise92> Btw guys Albert Einstein isn't smart and briliant...it was his wife's Mileva Einstein
<Paradise92> (she was a serbian girl)
<Paradise92> it will be announced
<Paradise92> this friday
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: i think you're confusing flux and flux density
<otakon> Paradise92: sure, right
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: hmm...IDK all I know is telsa times amps times meter is a newton
<Paradise92> otakon dude...belive what you want...they have confident evidence
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: yup
<Paradise92> so yeah
<spiritwaffle> whats everypony up to ? 6u8
<Saturn> 08,01which makes it flux density
<spiritwaffle> 6u9*
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: like I said....IDK
<Paradise92> spiritwaffle we are doing SCIENCE!
<spiritwaffle> awesome :D
<otakon> Paradise92: more Serbian pride?
<Paradise92> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHOR9_yMakU&feature=related and this
<Zappy> FOR SCIENCE!
<Paradise92> otakon AYE!
<Paradise92> NOVAK DJOKOVIC FTW!!
<emangamer|physics> Zappy: no what I'M doing is for science
<Paradise92> OUR VOLLEYBALL TEAM
<Paradise92> FTW!
<spiritwaffle> what kinda science? dark matter, atoms etc
<emangamer|physics> Paradise92: ease up on the caps lock
<otakon> Paradise92: I highly doubt that Einsteins WIFE was responsible for the Manhattan Project
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: you can think of it like the difference between charge and current
<emangamer|physics> spiritwaffle: we'll be doing dark matter in about 2 monts
<Saturn> 08,01except it's nothign liek that
<spiritwaffle> yay
*emangamer|physics cant wait for modern physics...
<Paradise92> otakon actually that is still under the question...
<Saturn> 08,01modern physics is best physics
<Saturn> 08,01and oh so screwy
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: I cant wait till we discuss the double slit experiment
<fillyfillyy> ill be back in a little bit guys but for now goodbye
<Paradise92> otakon but remember
<otakon> Paradise92: bumpkiss
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: oh baby, oh baby
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: thats what makes it so awesome
<Shizuka> 13why are we kissing bumps
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: it's the only kind of young's slit i like.
<Saturn> 08,01*horrific rimshot*
*Shizuka 13smacks Saturn
<Shizuka> 13bad joke >:I
<Paradise92> otakon Einstein wasn't the only scientest = mass murderer that was being under the Manhatan Project
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: that was terrible...
<emangamer|physics> Shizuka: wanna talk physics with me and Saturn?
<otakon> Paradise92: that is harsh
<otakon> emangamer|physics: why are you studying physics?
<Paradise92> otakon say what you want the facts are there...if they didn't invented the Atomic Bomb there wouldn't be Hiroshima and Nagasaki
<emangamer|physics> Shizuka: the force on a while carrying 8.75 amps is a maximum of 1.28 N when placed between the pole faces of a magnet. IF the pole faces are 55.5 cm in diameter, what is the approximate strength of the magnetic field?
<otakon> Paradise92: no I'm not saying that, but it's not like Einstein liked doing it
<Jaegerpony> who invented it....
<Paradise92> otakon then why did he did it??
<otakon> emangamer|physics: I am at a loss for words
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: just remember: schroedinger's cat was meant to *disprove* the Copenhagen Interpretation reductio ad absurdum
<Shizuka> 13four horsepower
<otakon> Paradise92: if anything to bring a end to the war
<TrixieMuffin> Paradise92 , the other way round , if they didnt drop the bombHiroshima and Nagasaki would still be there
<Saturn> 08,01not that you'd be asked that in an exam...
<emangamer|physics> silly Shizuka the units are in tesla...
<Paradise92> TrixieMuffin and we would talk in Japanese now :D
<alexxm> night guys
<Paradise92> HI!
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: I know
<MirrorImage> Mane6 stream going live now
<Krakass> Yes, the atom bomb was a wonderful invention.
<Shizuka> 13the answer is nikola tesla
<emangamer|physics> otakon: because I have a test monday
<emangamer|physics> Shizuka: that actually sounds right :D
<Tarku> silly Shizuka
<emangamer|physics> where nikola is a constant
<Krakass> Otherwise the invasion of Japan would have been much more costly in human lives.
*Saturn 08,01is pleased with emangamer's physicsness
<Jaegerpony> d'awww
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: is this for school or uni?
<otakon> emangamer|physics: okay, curse my lack of taking physics in High School
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: wah???
<Shizuka> 13i slept through high school physics
<TrixieMuffin> lol no ? Japan was already finished by the time , the bombswere merely a show of force
<Shizuka> 13canary~<#
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: all the ladies are please with my physicness as well
<emangamer|physics> LadyCanary: <3
<LadyCanary> Ohai Shizuka :3 hi all.
<Dashie_Dashie> That EQD post....
<Dashie_Dashie> DAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<emangamer|physics> Shizuka: this isnt high school physics :/
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: do you enjoy physics?
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: very much so
<MelaPonie> emangamer|physics, i demand pics so i can judge this for myself...
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: yes it is
<alexxm> see u guys later
<LadyCanary> Bye alexxm
<Saturn> 08,01i did all this in high school
<otakon> bye alexxm
<mario_pony> alexxm: bye
<Paradise92> Saturn can i post a link for Mane6 stream?
<otakon> hiya LadyCanary how are you today?
<Saturn> 08,01maybe we do it different to you in scotland...
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: my HS physics teacher sucked really bad...we finished the semester learning only kenesticics
<Saturn> 08,01seeing as we're such a powerhouse of innovation
<mario_pony> Krakass and otakon: screw it just forget it i give up
<otakon> mario_pony: don't give up!
<otakon> mario_pony: go into your network settings
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: ah. so you're studying this at uni now?
<LadyCanary> I'm so happy. I found out I only have to do 3 out of 4 response papers during this semester for a class and Im deciding not to do this one because it's really freaking difficult. I think I made a good choice.
<Krakass> Estimates of the US invading Japan was as high as 500,000 US soldiers. Jpanese would have been even higher.
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: is it your major?
<otakon> mario_pony: tell me if you have internet connection enabled
<LadyCanary> What about you otakon?
<Paradise92> otakon watching Mane6 stream and there will be Online Mode for Fighting is Magic :D :D
<otakon> LadyCanary: okay I guess
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: no this is for my physics 222 class...and no I'm majoring in computer science
<Jaegerpony> powerhouse of inovation?
<otakon> brb checking something
<emangamer|physics> LadyCanary: well thats GREAT news!
<RoflBot> 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01Paradise92: sure
*emangamer|physics throws a party for LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> ._.
<LadyCanary> I-it's not a big deal.
<Paradise92> http://www.livestream.com/mane6 !!!! ONLINE MODE ENGAGED!! YES THERE WILL BE ONLINE FIGHTING WITH PONIES!!!
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer|physics: ah, okay
<Jaegerpony> the two powerhouses of innovation were UK and Austria
<emangamer|physics> LadyCanary: any reason for a party is a good reason
<emangamer|physics> bye Paradise92
<LadyCanary> I'm just happy I can do the other ones with ease.
<LadyCanary> Because I UNDERSTAND IT.
<Paradise92> ummm...why bye?
<LadyCanary> Saturn :3 :3
<otakon> Jaegerpony: Austrailia? and the UK? IN WW2 ERA? YOU are insane
<emangamer|physics> oh shit...not only do I have to study, but I have to write 3 mini papers...this will be a FUN night -_-
<Saturn> 08,01LadyCanary!
<LadyCanary> Do it filly
<LadyCanary> Wubz.
<otakon> emangamer|physics: you can do it!
*Saturn 08,01hugs LadyCanary
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ahh a quick cold shower feels so nice
<Krakass> Austria =/= Australia
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hi everyone~
<emangamer|physics> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: get shot down?
<LadyCanary> Ay BRB I gotta babysit. Be riiiiight bac~
<Jaegerpony> Austria, not Australia
*otakon waves giant foam finger around rooting for emangamer|physics
<RoflBot> hehe
<emangamer|physics> otakon: I cant work if you keep DISTRACTING ME!!!
<otakon> Jaegerpony: oops, read it as Australia my mistake
<otakon> emangamer|physics: then get off the STREAM!!!!!
<emangamer|physics> otakon: THERE ISNT A STREAM....take THAT...
<emangamer|physics> I win
<Shizuka> 13GET OFF MY PLANE
<otakon> Shizuka: there is no plane
<emangamer|physics> Shizuka: wanna come to flatland with me?
<Shizuka> 13GET OFF MY LINE
<Shizuka> 13then
<MIDNIGHT> what do you mean? this black screen stream is AWESOME
<otakon> there is no line
<Krakass> Bluie Pie!
<Shizuka> 13GET OFF MY POINT
<MIDNIGHT> Chartreusey Pie
<otakon> /)_-)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's not TF2
<Jaegerpony> swirly thing in the middle!
<otakon> my GOD I'm bored atm
<otakon> mario_pony: have you updated your PS3 recently?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> gog ¡
<otakon> mario_pony: tell me the version you are running, it should be 4.11 now
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjje_U180T4&feature=related
<mario_pony> otakon: i can't it says i need the internet
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm going to TF2 for a while~
<otakon> mario_pony: check your version
<CriticKitten> mfw math-related jokes
<Zappy> got to go. goodnight everypony.
<otakon> night Zappy
<Krakass> Night Zappy
<CriticKitten> Now I'm forced to post this in reply to Shizuka's comments: http://sciencefun.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/snakes_on_a_plane.jpg
<mario_pony> otakon: it's 3.72
<emangamer|physics> CriticKitten: that is amazing
<Jaegerpony> they should do a Double Pinkie attack for that Fighting is Magic
<otakon> mario_pony: jesus christ no wonder, you are a TON of updates behind
<emangamer|physics> CriticKitten: thats going on my tumblr
<otakon> mario_pony: here's what I want you to do
<mario_pony> otakon: how can i update?
<Saturn> 08,01zomg
<Saturn> 08,01fighting is magic
<otakon> mario_pony: turn off your PS3, hard reset your router, turn it back on then go through the automatic setup for your PS3
<Paradise92> Lol pinkie pie has a move that destroys the 4th wall
<Saturn> 08,01pinkie is just so cool
<CriticKitten> eman: inorite
<emangamer|physics> bye everypony...I have SCIENCE to do
<otakon> mario_pony: you'll have to dc for at LEAST 30 seconds
<mario_pony> otakon: how do i reset my router?
<otakon> mario_pony: and when I say hard reset, remove the battery pack and unplug it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Laters emangamer|physics
<emangamer|physics> Saturn: apparently I think diameter = radius /)_-
<Dashie_Dashie> Saturn, link me =o?
<otakon> mario_pony: unplug it and remove the battery pack
<Saturn> 08,01woo
<Jaegerpony> http://www.livestream.com/mane6
<otakon> mario_pony: then after about 30 seconds reconnect it and let it power back up
<emangamer|physics> I fefuse to watch that because spoilers
<emangamer|physics> bye otakon <3
<otakon> bye emangamer|physics good luck
*emangamer|physics nuzzles otakon goodbye
<Jaegerpony> *shrugs*
<Paradise92> Jaegerpony Pinkie Pie is God Tear !
*emangamer|physics RUNS LIKE HELL
<Jaegerpony> heh well she can break the 4th wall
<otakon> eeyup
<Jaegerpony> and catch up with anypony
<Paradise92> Jaegerpony and that is her Move dammit :D
<Jaegerpony> ^^
<Jaegerpony> that doesn't surprise me
<otakon> mario_pony: you back yet?
<Paradise92> ...and now Rarity
<Jaegerpony> Will it be for consoles only?
<Paradise92> ...
<Paradise92> no
<otakon> Jaegerpony: no, it's PC only
<Paradise92> it is a PC ame
<Paradise92> game
<Jaegerpony> oh good
<Krakass> I wonder if they could release it on XBLA.
<Jaegerpony> *doesn't own a console* (unless you count a Commondore Vic20)
<otakon> Jaegerpony: it's a 2D fighter, I don't think keyboards are too good for that
<mario_pony> otakon: where is my battery pack?
<Krakass> It supports a bunch of different controllers.
<Jaegerpony> that's why I thought a console game
<otakon> mario_pony: check underneath the router for a panel to remove that is where the battery pack should be
<Jaegerpony> I guess I will have to purchase a PC controller thingy
<otakon> mario_pony: otherwise just unplug it and let it sit for 30 seconds then plug it back in
<CupcakeWarrior> Jaegerpony: download libusb to play using 360/ps3 controller
<otakon> Jaegerpony: they're inexpensive, plus you can just use a Xbox 360 wired controller
<Jaegerpony> really?
<Jaegerpony> they plug into PCs?
<Krakass> You can also use the xbox 360 wireless controller if you buy the adapter
<Jaegerpony> aah
<Jaegerpony> didn't know that
<otakon> Krakass: but that's more expensive so WHY BOTHER?
<Cavy> Special Move better be Tom.
<Cavy> =D
<Krakass> Because I already have wireless controllers and not the wired ones?
<CupcakeWarrior> I have a question
<Krakass> I choose you CupcakeWarrior
<CupcakeWarrior> How good is ubuntu compared to windows?
<Jaegerpony> I guess I can steal an old wired controller from my nephews
<Jaegerpony> Depends what you want to do, cupcake
<CupcakeWarrior> Just performance wise
<mario_pony> otakon: there do i plug it back in?
<Krakass> Its fine. The main issue is if the software you want is available on it.
<Jaegerpony> I have an old tablet PC with Ubuntu on, and a theme that looks just like win7
<Jaegerpony> It's a little less hungry than windows. but not much
<Jaegerpony> Ubuntu is a heavyweight in Linux
<otakon> mario_pony: the same plug you pulled it out from
<Jaegerpony> there are lighter distros
<otakon> mario_pony: all your doing is hard resetting the router
<mario_pony> oh
<otakon> mario_pony: just make sure to save any work your doing first
<Krakass> You're still online while your router is unplugged?
<otakon> and downloads or such
<otakon> wait
<otakon> damn it
<Jaegerpony> I like Ubuntu a LOT, but I need windows for some programmes to run, and little free apps I use
<CupcakeWarrior> Can I just run ubuntu off the disk?
<Jaegerpony> give ubuntu its due though, it worked straight away, installed from USB, installed everything
<Jaegerpony> Yup
<Jaegerpony> liveCD will run
<Jaegerpony> use the internet etc
<Jaegerpony> no change to PC
<CupcakeWarrior> Does it replace windows?
<mario_pony> otakon: why didn't you tell me a
<Jaegerpony> not unless you ask it to install
<CupcakeWarrior> k
<Paradise92> haha AJ is like Scorpion...
<mario_pony> otakon: does that mean my save files were deleted?
<otakon> mario_pony: tell you wat?
<Krakass> Ya'll get over here.
<otakon> mario_pony: your disconnecting your router to reset it
<Dashie_Dashie> I can't wait for Fighting is magic .__.
<Jaegerpony> pull plug out of wall?
<otakon> mario_pony: you know what, don't do it nevermind this is impossible without being there in person, you fucked atm
<Jaegerpony> I so want Fighting is Magic and PonyKart.. really bad
<CupcakeWarrior> When will they be done with Fighting is Magic?
<Krakass> Soon
<CupcakeWarrior> Wait
<Jaegerpony> They look close to beta from this example
<CupcakeWarrior> Is PonyKart a real thing?
<Krakass> Yes
<Krakass> At least as far as I know it is.
<CupcakeWarrior> OH F*yay* YES
<Krakass> It could be an elaborate prank.
<Jaegerpony> There's development ongoing as far as I've seen - no reason to think it's not going through
<otakon> mario_pony: and as for updating your PS3 just look it up online, you can download the update to a USB Flash Drive (if it's big enough) and then run it from there.
<Jaegerpony> It's a hell of a lot of work for a prank
<CupcakeWarrior> People have worked harder than that on pranks before
<Jaegerpony> and they'd make a ton from it
<CupcakeWarrior> just saying
<Krakass> Like pretending to be a staff member for FiM
<Jaegerpony> pull prank or get rich
<Krakass> They're not charging for ponykart
<mario_pony> otakon: wouldn't it of been easier to tell me that in the first place?
<Jaegerpony> and facebook doesn't charge either
<Jaegerpony> but they're still raking it in
<Jaegerpony> there is always a way to make money
<otakon> mario_pony: yh, but I didn't realize this would be like assembling a jigsaw puzzle in the dark
<mario_pony> lol
<otakon> mario_pony: it shouldn't be this damn hard, LOOK IT UP ON GOOGLE
<Krakass> That's because facebook sells all their info about you to advertisers.
<Jaegerpony> yup
<CupcakeWarrior> Sccary stuff
<otakon> it's NOT setting up a damn LAN, it has AUTOMATIC setting to connect to the internet
<otakon> which means if that's not working your PS3 is busted
<Jaegerpony> and with Google's new privacy policy -they can link ALL their seperate info about you into One Big Profile
<Jaegerpony> yay
<mario_pony> but i only had it for 2 months
<Aircrafter> o.o
<Krakass> Just wondering did we start with having mario_pony disable security on his router?
<Jaegerpony> I reckon it's firewall or something
<CupcakeWarrior> Jaegerpony: That means youtube tracks you too?
<Jaegerpony> oh yes
<Jaegerpony> massively
<CupcakeWarrior> 0_0
<Jaegerpony> watch this - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfV6RzE30
<Jaegerpony> it's about what Google is doing
<Dashie_Dashie> Something tells me Twilight might be a little OP for being a magic based caracter.
<Jaegerpony> ironically it's hosted on youtube
<CupcakeWarrior> OP?
<Dashie_Dashie> overpowered
<CCCP> hello everypony!!!
<gold> derpy needs 1/2 cups water to make a tray of muffins. if derpy has 1 3/4 cups of water, how many trays of muffins can derpy make?
<Krakass> I'm sure they'll balance it with testing
<Jaegerpony> I'm sure they'll do a ton of testing to get an even balance
<Jaegerpony> heh
<CupcakeWarrior> I hate fighting games but I will give it a try
<Jaegerpony> great minds, krakass
<CupcakeWarrior> when it comes out
<Krakass> Indeed.
<gold> like my math problem?
<Aircrafter> Gold: She doesnt need too make muffins, because shes so epic that whenever she has a daw moment she automatically makes muffins come out of her derpy eyes.
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Derpy_Hooves> its a piece of cake to bake a pretyy cake~
<Aircrafter> And that was the physics of derpy with aircrafter. Come again.
<Jaegerpony> "If you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place" - Google CEO
<CriticKitten> Uh.
<CCCP> :s
<Aircrafter> Then I guess I should probably stop being a brony...
<CriticKitten> Yeah, I'll watch the game when they've actually decided on stuff. :p
<The_4th_Wall> NEVER NEVER NEVER"
<CupcakeWarrior> Dont stop being a brony
<Aircrafter> Oh wait, you cant stop being a brony :P
<CriticKitten> "Subject to change", to me, means "don't get attached to anything since we may change it at random"
<Jaegerpony> The trick is to get EVERYONE to become a brony -then it becomes normality
<Kipkat07> hi everypony
<Aircrafter> I would like too see the president of the U.S. Or any important country become a brony.
<Aircrafter> Hey Kipkat07
<gold> wait, how can derpy only have 1 3/4 of water in a town with running water ?
<Jaegerpony> subject to change - means we covered our ass to save having to pay for lawyers
<gold> 6_9
<Krakass> She didn't pay the water bill.
<Jaegerpony> We just need to push harder with Clinton, right?
<Kipkat07> just woke up from a 6 hour nap. 830 PM naow
<Aircrafter> Because they were late on cleaning up winter so all the water was frozen.
<Jaegerpony> that's a start :P
<gold> any way
<gold> back to my homework
<Aircrafter> If derpy derped three times, and then rainbow dash caused a sonic rainboom, how many windows would derpy have broken?
<Krakass> They need to show Fluttershy and RD.
<Jaegerpony> rainbow broke the windows

*Midnight_Tempest explodes again, into a neater pile

<Meanwhile> And then Steam burnt into a leathery crispy smouldering mess.
<Meanwhile> I return.
<Capn_fisty> CountDoofus: nah, no connection to steam and its late here too
<Jaketehsnake> MeanWHile, sorry bro my steam went ARRRRGGG and died
<Jaketehsnake> WE DID IT THOUGH!
<Jaketehsnake> WE ARE GODS
<Meanwhile> Jaketehsnake: I think that happened to everyone.
<Midnight_Tempest> im dling a bunch of MLP skins for L4D2
<Meanwhile> Nearly dead gods.
<Jaketehsnake> Nearly dead gods but gods all the same
<mario_pony> i am Kratos!!!!
<Meanwhile> I am Sparticus
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I keep forgetting to mod L4D2.
<Jaketehsnake> When steam comes back whos up for MOAR!?!?!
<Jaketehsnake> or Killing Floor
<Midnight_Tempest> god is dead - nietzsche, nietzche is dead - God
<CountDoofus> think I'm gonna find me a MLP related spray for TF2 and L4D before heading in
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam's down?
<Midnight_Tempest> steam is back up
<Jaketehsnake> I have some I just need to apply them
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: it is if you've just finished Blood Harvest.
<CountDoofus> that brony meme is so going on my facebook btw
<otakon> mfw Toei animated the ORIGINAL MLP series
<Krakass> Dang it, did I miss fluttershy?
<Jaketehsnake> We did blood harvest on Expert. We have become nearly dead gods
<mario_pony> F**K i missed fluttershy!!!!!!!!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I remember everyone played No Mercy a ton in the original L4D.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes yes you did
<Midnight_Tempest> i see... play blood harvest, on expert in the original L4D... you will die like pigs
<Krakass> Now I have to wait for the replay.
*mario_pony cries :'(
*Jaketehsnake is sad. Pigs?
<Krakass> Bacon?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01On average, I play on advanced.
<Meanwhile> Midnight_Tempest: did it, got the achievement.
<CountDoofus> my favorite campaign in L4D was Dead Air. got a thing for planes
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile: what achievement
<Meanwhile> Midnight_Tempest: all campaigns on expert.
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o dear god no...
<Midnight_Tempest> all campaigns on expert can only be done with a well tuned group of 4 players
<Midnight_Tempest> i have yet to find that group
<bartsonic> i really like this pmv http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogkgF90X6Rw

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You wouldn't want me. People tend to get in the way of my bullets.
<Meanwhile> Black hole muzzle
<Kipkat07> i shoot everything so dont worry
<Midnight_Tempest> perhaps you shouldn't point the guns at the other players Nittany_Discord... its L4D2, not TF2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I try not to, but people still get in the way.
<Midnight_Tempest> then they need to crouch
<Capn_fisty> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jajZ6CmOn28&feature=related
<Meanwhile> One does not simply crouch in L4D2.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Have you seen me play on stream?
<Meanwhile> The real way to do things is to run like a looney and hope everyone else follows suit.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah...if you want to restart 50 times.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Left 4 Speed Run The Game

<LadyCanary> Aged 12, 11, 6, and 3.

<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: it'll probably be in may if thats the case
<MahBoi777> lol, mission accomplished
<IshBestPony> bartsonic are you saying mlp is the cure foar emo
<Meanwhile> bartsonic: you sound like a socially superior version of me. It does get better, always remember that.
<Kipkat07> mlp & bronystate helped me convince myself I have friends
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> wow, bartsonic just made me really sad for a second there
<LadyCanary> And I shall be back!! Goin home~ errybody smile
<LadyCanary> <3

<bartsonic> i wasnt emo per say
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: I hope so, Mass Effect 3 will make me broke
<Midnight_Tempest> ._____.
<mario_pony> i punched a wall soo much i left a crack and made my knuckles bleed
<CountDoofus> this community... I truly hope it lasts foreeeeveeeer
<Meanwhile> Depression and emo, not the same thing.
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: why broke? you pre-ordered it right?
<Dark_Horst> mass effect 3 also gets sold via origin which is why i'll pirate it
<MahBoi777> ah depression, I do not miss you one bit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> damn i suck so mucg at killing floor
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> much*
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: not Dragon's Dogma, just Mass Effect 3 and it's nto quite paid off as of yet
<flutter_spin> Why did I watch that? Its so... sad http://andyswag.deviantart.com/art/My-Name-is-Dinky-Hooves-FANFLASH-285446358
<IshBestPony> bartsonic "I have tried hurting myself" sounds pretty emo to me
<Midnight_Fyre> It's not , necessarily
<Meanwhile> IshBestPony: that's depression and is physchological problems, emo is a whinier version of goth.
*Midnight_Tempest looks at the knife cuts on his hands. o.o i hurt myself daily it seems...
<Midnight_Fyre> Anyway, that was a nice story. Glad MLP was able to help you
<Kipkat07> i dated an emo... once I heard her ask me for a dog collar i was like o___o
<CupcakeWarrior> lol
<bartsonic> i guess mlp was a cure and thats good i feel better now i feel better not a loner i can get on here and talk to you guys and be well happy its good knowing that im liked
<flutter_spin> It is the part of me that reflects Pinkie Pie. I like to make people smile. Hard to do without friends.
<Jaketehsnake> Midnight, Unintentionally correct?
<mario_pony> Kipkat07: was she hot?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14good to hear, bartsonic!

<otakon> LISTEN TO THAT AND JAM!
<bartsonic> so maybe in a way mlp could cure the world with this war and violence
<flutter_spin> Was she Abby from NCIS?
<otakon> if only man if only
<IngloriousPony89> Hey guys
<Midnight_Fyre> I suppose MLP has helped make me a bit less of the cynical bastard that I had become after spending years on a political messageboard that basically drains your soul from the stupidity and vitriol from both sides of the aisle
<MahBoi777> hello IngloriousPony89
<Jaketehsnake> ^^^^
<Meanwhile> I wish I could say MLP cured me, but it's only served as a really big speed bump thus far.
<Jaketehsnake> Life story Fyre
<otakon> heya IngloriousPony89 hwo ya doing today?
<flutter_spin> I think the only 'difference' MLP made in me is not being afraid to have interest in something that is shunned by the world.
<IngloriousPony89> Pretty good. Sick, but pretty good other than that.
<Jaketehsnake> Ok guys, food for 10 Minutes then some VIDEO GAMES
<bartsonic> meanwhile i hope it can some day help you more not just be a speed bump
<IngloriousPony89> What VIDEO GAMES Jake?
<Midnight_Fyre> I think one of the reasons I found the show so appealing was because it provided such a great alternative to that place
<bartsonic> ^
<otakon> indeed
<Jaketehsnake> PROBABLY ZOMBIE VIDEOGAMES

<Midnight_Fyre> The political situation there is a bit dicey at the moment though
<Aircrafter> CCCP: As said from some guy I dont know, people who dont miss the USSR are unpatriotic, but people who want it back are insane.
<otakon> CCCP: oh yes, i was so great
<CCCP> hiya RAWRity
<RAWRity> mario_pony: we get into heated debates over such innocuous topics as "Is mare-do-well a good episode?". We are not collectively intelligent and civil enough to actually cover anything from the real world.
<CCCP> Aircrafter: im insane
<Jaketehsnake> Now that I have fool in y belly, WHOS READY FOR SOME VIDEOER GAMES
<Aircrafter> CCCP: I expected much, lets be insane together 8D

<Jaketehsnake> pitched*
<CCCP> i am paranoid though
<Kipkat07> 14
<mario_pony> Kipkat07: why do you need money?
<Midnight_Fyre> CCCP, you remind me exactly of a guy I know on another forum. Although I disagree with his politics, we like to talk about world affairs and our mutual desire to visit NK
<RAWRity> speaking of Mare do well, anybody here seen Chad Rocco's review of that episode?
<flutter_spin> Someone asked Xyro about the economy and he politely responded "I cannot say anything about the economy because I have a full time job. I prefer not to comment"
<CCCP> Midnight_Fyre: is that a good thing?
<LadyCanary> A wee bit RAWRity. Just saw Mare do Well on the site and thought Id give it a go
<Midnight_Fyre> Sure, he's one of the more level headed people on a forum full of a-holes, even if I don't agree with him often
<CCCP> Midnight_Fyre: lol
<mario_pony> Kipkat07: why do you need money?
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: he kinda tears into it.
<LadyCanary> ...Ow.
<RAWRity> and by kinda I mean really
<Jaketehsnake> Derpy T shirs XD

<Jaketehsnake> Dark_horst, At least over 9000 maybe moar
<flutter_spin> Let's see. Cooler = 20%, does anyone know the percentage of "awesome"
<Kipkat07> it doesnt bother me as much as it should because im used to death in the family
<mario_pony> Kipkat07: i never knew my dad either he left when i was born.
<Dark_Horst> we need somebody in here who knows the rad/cool course
<Jaketehsnake> awesome is 60%
<MahBoi777> just keep your head up Kipkat07
<Midnight_Fyre> Awesome is measured in fractions. It is approximately 1/5 more awesome than anything else
<Dark_Horst> that reminds me, we never streamed the pick of destiny in here, did we?
<Kipkat07> im the last Koleff in my family that is a kid
<IngloriousPony89> Dont believe so Dark
<Dark_Horst> we really hsould
<Kipkat07> Koleff is my surname
<Jaketehsnake> you guys do not understand, Jake needs Video Games, Somepony must Join him in his wqquest!
<Kipkat07> thats why im so proud of my family
<flutter_spin> I would love to move out of my house and live on my own, but the amount I make is less of the bills my mom gets for the house she got.

<RaveBrony> Told all my friends, and they still mock me about it, but its a friendly thing not a bully way :P
<flutter_spin> One guy said "You tell me about new movies, video games, and tv shows that are good. You are never wrong. If you say it is good, it MUST be good"
<capn_fisty> My friends are mostly indifferent, one of them says its just because its mlp that people care, plenty other cartoons get a following

<Dark_Horst> horizons is the only spinoff that measures up to kkats original
<TOY_PON3> I think Fighting is Magic is going going to turn out to be a big hit :3
<otakon> Jaketehsnake: Horizons is pretty good, but it pulls even less punches at times. Chapter 8 got me in tears by the end of it
<Randall1160> I still have to finish the original >..>
<Dark_Horst> probably becasue kkat helped the writer a great deal, as it seems
<TOY_PON3> going going :D

<otakon> Pegasister24: Sunset is a good choice
<Jaketehsnake> Dark_horst , I was violently Assulted with plot twists by FO: E . They were enjoyable plottwsists
<IngloriousPony89> Same here Pegasister. Dont know why.
<mario_pony> Pegasister24: bubbles

<otakon> Jaketehsnake: well you won't find too many in Horizon I don't think but it's a bit harsher
*IngloriousPony89 needs to read Bubbles now
<TOY_PON3> Dammit sad Derpy fic! :(
<MahBoi777> I've found that sneaking up behind a witch with a baseball bat is a BAD IDEA
<Placebo> Dark_Horst: Only read the first 2 chapters, I think. Just wasn't getting in to it. Guess the whole "Hide the screwdriver up your anus" thing got me.
<otakon> flutter_spin: TAKE THAT BACK! it's CHIP TUNE 8 BIT, NOT AUTOTUNE

<RAWRity> IngloriousPony89: not a tear.
<Kipkat07> after mld and the fanfic that cant be named i cant read sad or grimdark fanfics
<TOY_PON3> RAWRity: Like a baws
<RAWRity> I felt it was way too manipulative to find it sad.
<Meanwhile> My Little Dashie made me realise that my wall was really interesting.
<Dark_Horst> Placebo: if you liked the original fallout you should give project horizons another try. it'll be worth your time
<flutter_spin> Nonono.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BseyCNMQBc autotune
<CCCP> If u didn't cry while reading MLD u have no soul
*Placebo didn't cry.

*Jaketehsnake Placebo TO THE MOON
<TOY_PON3> Placebo: I love you <3
<RAWRity> It didn't feel like this was an organic story that was sad. It felt like the guy was just trying to hit ever "sad" trope and cliche he could fit into the story in order to try and tug heartstrings

<RAWRity> Dark_Horst Pinkie Pie
<flutter_spin> It was their Superbowl stunt
<RAWRity> prince-dari: sponsors.
<Placebo> I highly doubt they were short on funds for this.
<Dark_Horst> i'll settle for that explanation
<By-tor> Yeah, isn't this a Ford commercial?
<Placebo> Wut.
<By-tor> Chevy
<prince-dari> This is an advert?

<Everlasting_Joy> :)
<Placebo> Dodge needs to higher Piccolo, stat.
<Saturn> 08,01um
<flutter_spin> No. I don't think they officially made a commercial for it. There was just a notation at the bottom of the Superbowl for "click here for video"
<prince-dari> I have never seen an advert that long... O_o
<Saturn> 08,01what
<mario_pony> well i have to shower and go to bed good night everypony!

<flutter_spin> Italians
<Placebo> Kipkat07: Top left.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<flutter_spin> YES
<otakon> apparently
<Dark_Horst> well, it DOES sound a bit similar to japanese... but it's clearly not
<mario_pony> bye!
<flutter_spin> Italy did a different introduction
<flutter_spin> This is the extended version
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I am now imagining Ezio watching this intro
<otakon> Dark_Horst: your kidding right?
<LadyCanary> ..

<KetaminaDianePie> vola e vai!
<Kipkat07> this is cool. its like the music in the sims. its good but you cant understand it
<Dark_Horst> someonen who doesn't know italian could mistake it for japanese at first
<Randall1160> CMC with flippers, FORESHADOWING
<flutter_spin> Everyone did the same introduction as US except Italian just went "We can do better"
<RAWRity> I can't imagine having to sit through this. every saturday.
<Saturn> 08,01wow, this goes on for freakin' ages
<By-tor> Yeah, that was pretty long.
<otakon> Dark_Horst: not a chance in hell
<flutter_spin> uh oh

<CupcakeWarrior> French Pinkie's voice is cute

<Everlasting_Joy> flutter_spin you're kidding, right?
<Saturn> 08,01the lass singing this has a *horrible* voice
<RainbowJack> come on pinkie dance the CAN CAN

<Polydunami> I got the gist of it on the first view
<SuperBrony64|TACOS> 10,02Jigsaw: "You bronies have long enjoyed your show without a care in the world or thought about the true meaning of friendship. Before you lies a stream that is connected through a series of wires attached to your body. It will detect a release of adrenaline caused by the adorableness of the ponies before you. Everytime you DAAW, will inject a poison into your veins that will turn you
<SuperBrony64|TACOS> 10,2into what you desire most, a pony. Can you depress your deepest emotions to save yourself? Live or Pony, make your choice."

<TheWyrm> Hello Bronies... either insomniacs or Australians! Are you a pony comedy writer? How about a pony artist looking to make some $ while being treated as an artist instead of a laborer? Message me about The Pun Pony Project!
<Dashie_Dashie> Suddenly, what the view from my house looks like. http://i.imgur.com/lHAAx.jpg
<Phase4> TheWyrm: whut?
<Phase4> Dashie_Dashie: nice view
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Oh wow, awesome :D
<KwakLad> TheWyrm: im english and it 9:30 am i dont fit either of you present catagories
*Phase4 is australian so he was right for at least one person
<MahBoi777> Dashie_Dashie: nice indeed
<TheWyrm> Silly KwakLad, English is a language, not a nationality!
<KwakLad> Erm
<KwakLad> Whut?
<TheWyrm> Phase4, it's a tumblr comic with paid artists and a team of writers to create comedy.

<TheWyrm> How can someone be from Whales? They live in the ocean.
<Dashie_Dashie> mfw it's spelled wales
<KwakLad> anywhoo time to go an clean up the exploded knife
<TheWyrm> I know there's the story of Jonas and the whale, but I don't think enough people get eaten by whales enough to justify it as a nationality.
<Phase4> TheWyrm: interesting, the paid bit sounds questionable. not interested sorry
<Dashie_Dashie> My first day on bronystate I did this <3 http://i.imgur.com/etskZ.jpg
<TheWyrm> Phase4, that's cool. I've already got 4 artists and 2 writers on the project.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Which most likely it does
<Dashie_Dashie> $100 for a 32gig?
<Conyst> that is the only bad part about it is the memory
<Dashie_Dashie> to hell with that
<Dashie_Dashie> I can get 60 gigs for $100
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's for the memory card, yes
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You don't need that much storage really
<Dashie_Dashie> a little over priced for a memory stick honestly..

<d3rb> hmmmm, better not sure. close call
<d3rb> rollcage is damn awesome though
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm sure the'll come out with analog stick mods.
<Dashie_Dashie> like they have for the consoles
<Paradise92> get to 700 and you can't do s*it
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is he selling me something now? O___O
<Dashie_Dashie> So SuperBrony64: Wifi or 3G?
<Dashie_Dashie> which one.
<SuperBrony64> 10,023G :D
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Because I don't want to regret it later on down the road O___O
<Dashie_Dashie> Well if it goes through AT&T it'll cost extra for 3G service I would assume.
<Scavender> Bai guys, back to work. Have fun here.
<Conyst> Wifi for me
<d3rb> cya scavender
<Conyst> cause there is no 3g where I live
<Conyst> bye Scavender
<Dashie_Dashie> oh god WHY

<d3rb> lol
<Dashie_Dashie> 300+ subscriptions on youtube and there isn't sh** to watch
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But yeah, it costs money for 3G
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The games don't come with instruction manuals ;___;
<Dashie_Dashie> If the Vita allows me to download Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2 on their market place.
<Dashie_Dashie> instant buy for me.
<d3rb> digital manuals suck
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup
<SuperBrony64> 10,02OH GOD

<Dashie_Dashie> for handheld those graphics are awesome.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<d3rb> WHAT THE HELL

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Some of the more expensive stuff like Apple, they have to send back I believe
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But this, they usually let you keep I think
<Dashie_Dashie> No comprimises? so that means no hacked systems?

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Also Super Mario 3D Land :3
<Barberaboy> ...
<RawketLawnchair> Mario Party: The game that tests friendships.
<Dashie_Dashie> My list goes: #1: SM64 #2: Sunshine #3 MG 1&2

<Dashie_Dashie> TROLOLOL
<Phase4> ^
<Conyst> oh god Iremember that
<Barberaboy> i want them to finish that game so much
<Phase4> applejack theme from fighting is magic is good
<Dashie_Dashie> Twilight and applejack themes are best for this game
<Dashie_Dashie> IMO
<Dashie_Dashie> I can't wait for this game <3
<Dashie_Dashie> I want to fight you all with friendship <3
<Conyst> Twi is op

<Dashie_Dashie> !!
<RawketLawnchair> I am faintly reminded of Touhou.
<Dashie_Dashie> SuperBrony64! LET'S PITCH THIS IDEA TO NINTENDO.
<Dashie_Dashie> Make our 3DS's compatable with wireless connection to our computers.
<RawketLawnchair> Also, AppleJapplejapple has a skin that is Big Mac colors
<RawketLawnchair> It's real neato.
<Dashie_Dashie> and use them for vidya games. :3
<Dashie_Dashie> aka
<Dashie_Dashie> Fighting is magic
<RawketLawnchair> Fightan games.
<Dashie_Dashie> also, Applejack theme next <3
<Barberaboy> celestia, luna, nightmare moon, discord, lyra, octavia, vinyl, bon-bon, berry punch, spike, trixie, big mac SHOULD be the other 11 in my opinion
<Dashie_Dashie> pweaseeee

<ofna01> CCCP look at pinkie in laurens concept
<CCCP> So Pinkie pie was inspired by a pony named Suprise???

<CCCP> ya a bit but shes not grey
<ofna01> take the strings off the balloons,change the color slightly,derp the eyes,BOOm,its derpy
<CCCP> I wonder who made derpy

<ofna01> yeah
<Iwubponiez> she had those derpy eyes
<Iwubponiez> and look what happened
<Iwubponiez> she is now popular
<ofna01> she was just meant to be a regualr backround pony,but the eyes got derped,and,you know the rest
