<Chimera> 04the music is a direct rip from a game on the Genesis
<Barry> Mario survived longer
<HydrainaTopHat> Pokemon will literally never die. At this point, it makes up nearly half of Nintendo's revenue.
<Quill9294> :D

<kinkie_pinkie> yo
<HydrainaTopHat> Zelda is the best nintendo series, I THINK YOU MEANT. But Kirby's kickass too.
<Stargazer> i haven't seen it in years but i'm pretty sure i still like buckaroo banzai
<Vaporeon> 12XD
<PWNY> FINALLY
<cornllama> Season 7 episode 5 is just a slideshow of the ponies wearing socks
<mib_o65goz> what was mario a reinvention of?
<Riders> Buckaroo Banzai rocks. Don't worry everypony. it won't be another Accross the Universe night
<Clockwork> super mario galaxy is pretty good

<Dman> uh oh
<Quill9294> *rolls eyes*
<needsmorepony> POKEMON is awesome! the new seasons just suck
<Ghosties> Without, you know, actually saying something to me about it in a PM

<MrPoniator> Gimme a new Star Fox or F-Zero, damnit
<Ersatz> That too, ProfessorOak
<Barry> 30 years as of this year

<mib_6whstb> YES YES YES YES YES YE SY ESY EYSEY SEYE SY EYES

<mib_26hkd2> PONIES!
<TGAPT_fan> PONIES =D

<Sumica> Ponies sg1
<everfreenightss> AND NOW, THE BACKSTORY EPISODE

<Riders> I see where this thread is going
<Quill9294> wooo
<derpman> PONIES
<interior_gummy> and then they died
<drnz> and then they all died
<Nittany_Tiger> Silverscreen: Game makers only let franchises die when people get tired of them.
<Spitfire> safe zipline
<PWNY> good thing it wasn't 5 seconds later.
<PeanutButterWolf> Nintendo should end a franchise that makes a kabillion dollars a year. You should work at Wall St.
<mib_26hkd2> Universe + ponies!
<Jon> Wait what spike goes ziplining?
<Matarata> wiiiiiiiii
<Jon> How?
<^Stargazer> Spike zipglides?
<Winrarity> get it togeteher

<Anewbrony17> 0puns ftw!!!
<needsmorepony> pokemon will just be ash going back to the past regions with his harem of misty, may, dawn and iris and he becomes a pokemon master
<Barry> Zelda survived 25 years, and that's with it's failure of a video game Zelda II: The Adventure of Link
<Stranger> I like your background, streamer.
<Stargazer> if by 'worst' you mean best
<Rainbow-derp> ew she's all sticky
<Apprentice1994> that's because you suck
<DragonRage> Eh, Ike...
<interior_gummy> apple bloom is best cmc

<EdwardNewgate> MFW SWEETIE BELL IS BEST CMC PONY
<Angel_Espeon> 13Thanks |D
<BlayzeKOhime> Scootalo is the best because she is fun to hurt
<Jon> ...How often is there treesap in the plans?
<TimmoWarner> Namby pamby story makrs.
<HydrainaTopHat> Screw you, Sweetie Bell is BEST
<MyLittleIke> 9but honestly aside from FE and maybe Zelda I'm not much into Nintendo games any more
<mib_6whstb> dear mister guy hosting this great show, please give me that wallpaper
<MrPoniator> I call horseapples. You can't clean tree sap that easily
<Hipster_Brony> talking about sex =/= showing pornography
<Riders> I honestly want to know what Scootaloo had planned with that cannon
<TimmoWarner> Or marks.
<Dman> PREPARE YOURSELF I FIGHT FOR MY FRIENDS D: D:
<herospirit> EVERY PONY IS BEST PONY.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Came up with it like 3-4 years ago
<bronyinperu> AWESOME NIGHTMARE MOON WALLPAPER
<Barry> Pokemon didn't have a failing game, yet
<PeanutButterWolf> Zelda II was made in the 80's
<DragonRage> He's okay in Brawl, but god do I hate what they did with him in Radiant Dawn.
<Ersatz> Scootaloo is best chicken.
<Jon> Fluttershy!
<^Stargazer> Fluttershy is coolest pony
<MrSivril> i love scootaloo

<Silverscreen> 11Scootaloo just used her wings to fly
<EspyLacopa> The DS Castlevania games are fun.
<Dman> and/or metroid
<MyLittleIke> 9does that mean Ike X Scootaloo is canon?
<everfreenightss> derpy?
<Jon> ...fluttershy.
<interior_gummy> wand of gamelon=BEST ZELDA GAME EVER
<RainBroDash> 10Silverscreen. I respect that you're misguided, but Scootaloo is only good CMC, and you're just gonna have to realise that eventually

<Jon> Fuck we're stuck.
<Barry> No one speaks of the CDi games
<hotpockets> dosn't afraid of anything
<Dman> loll dashite
<Stargazer> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<RainBroDash> 10^
<DragonRage> She hovered above the ground slightly.
<Spazturtle_> RD x Scoot is canon
<Apprentice1994> well, fuck
<Riders> In b4 friendship
<DragonRage> That's not flying.
<EdwardNewgate> RainbroDash yfw Sweetie Bell is best CMC
<Combustiblelemons> SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THAT THING IS
<Rainbow-derp> oh I was guessing cloudkicker
<Dman> but if i say that i'll be kicked 10th time D:
<Flutteryay> Dat theme song
<Vice> 0AHHHHHHH
<shadowfalcon76> that's cuz CDi doesn't exist
<MrSivril> gummy ftw
<crono_flash> CDi is EVIL!
<HydrainaTopHat> All of the CMC are amazing, actually. They get annoying in big doses, but they're amazing in small amounts.
<Apprentice1994> sing along!
<MrPoniator> Scoot x Chicken, totally OTP
<Winrarity> dat opening
<Ersatz> Soarin' x Scootaloo. Ed likes chickens, eddy.
<RainBroDash> 10edwardnewgate, MFW is irrelevant, since it's not true
<Octavia> BLARG!
<mib_o65goz> hope we get a 20% cooler intro song in season 2
<herospirit> My favorite game EVER is Zelda CDI.
<Stargazer> friiiieeends

<NavyBrony> I used to hate this opening, and I fucking love it now!
<TallShadow> 0and sandwich makes it all complete
<RedBallon> Ed X Scootaloo
<Ghosties> 4Barry, PM
<Jon> Cmc is like sugar.too much makes you sick but just a little is good.
<interior_gummy> SoarinXPie...need to write a clopfic about that
<Anewbrony17> 0Yay
<Combustiblelemons> FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEENSSSSSSS
<HydrainaTopHat> We need to start holding these chats over Skype. So we can actually sing the themesong.
<DawnMist> Deraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<shadowfalcon76> blasphemy, zelda CDi doesn't exist
<MyLittleIke> 9Dman: Mario games are fun but I can't get into it. I like my games to have some sort of plot or atmosphere that can be taken seriously, or an intensely comedic one. Mario's "middle group" of an existence is not exactly the best territory for me.
<^Stargazer> Sweetie Bell X Fabric
<PWNY> TF2 FTW
<Vaporeon> 12I approve of that drawing :3
<nah> moral of the cmc: CHILDREN ARE IDIOTS
<PeanutButterWolf> ... nope still hate the opening theme.
<Clockwork> BZZZZZZ
<needsmorepony> there should be an episode where dj-pon-3 gets her own club
<Winrarity> DIES
<Quill9294> i agree jon...
<mib_o65goz> "Equestrian Pie"?
<Darkstar> Vermits!
*Shadow_Lugia 6suddenly harrumphs at her sprite.

<RainBroDash> 10needsmorepony YES
*Shadow_Lugia 6needs it to look good when it's at normal size and magnified.

<RainBroDash> 10edwardnewgate wanna go? let's go.
<huntywunty> canon
<aeiou> brbrbrbbbrbrbrbr
<Darkstar> O this is the episode Pinke messes up her story with how Equestria was made right?!?
<RainbowLoon> too much slideshow-ish for me. cyas tomorrow
<derpman> story time!
<Jon> I always wonder how flashbacks worked
<MyLittleIke> 9as for SmaBro...it's fun but it gets old early. I guess I'm just used to my quarter-circle-forwards and overcomplicated movements
<huntywunty> or what?
<Dman> Combustiblelemons: http://hejibits.com/comics/2011-03-07-gray-matter.png

<Dashite> Little Mac
<Apprentice1994> aww, bigmac
<shadowfalcon76> wow, o granny smith was that old even when AJ was a filly?
<mib_6whstb> awwww little mac
<Jon> I wanna tell storys in flashback
<Stargazer> love how AJ is the only Apple who is citrus colored ot apple colored. so her backstory is even kinda neater
<BlayzeKOhime> Real men cry manly tears
<shadowfalcon76> how old is she really?
<NavyBrony> Anybody think AJ shouting "thieving vermins" at the bunnies is a spoof on the tale of Benjamin Bunny?
<RainBroDash> 10huntywunty 'canon' means it's official, not fan-made content
<Riders> Seen this episode to death. I'm off to make a grilled cheese
<HydrainaTopHat> I'm a massive plot junkie, and I can still like Mario for the gameplay. That said, I understand why others might not.
<Octavia> I've been to Manehatten

<derpman> orange!
<ReticentSmolder> how quaint!
<MrPoniator> So wait. Applejack got her cutie mark later than anyone else in her class, yet she got hers when she was younger than the CMCs?
<Quill9294> >,<
<MrSivril> the living end?
<Apprentice1994> oranges related to apples, mind blown
<RainBroDash> 10EdwardNewgate let's do it.
<Vice> 0dat laugh
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Before you leave, have you played Yume Nikki since I last mentioned it?
<Riders> Quite.
<Octavia> Manehattenite
<HydrainaTopHat> Protip: the Oranges are a succeeding branch of the Apple Family who sold off most of the family assets in order to deal the stocks.
<derpman> wow
<Vice> 0dat voice
<MrPoniator> So... In a sense, she earned hers so much earlier?
<PWNY> best applejack ever.
<Barry> where as cannon is a weapon that fires lead balls at targets
