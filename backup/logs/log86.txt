<mib_f4fwza> Can we watch a stream of something by NIS next time... like Prinny: Can I really be the Hero?
<Solarboy27> Prinny is very frustrating to watch.
<NewDCD> 9if you want a NIS game
<NewDCD> 9I'd go with Zettai Hero Project
<Solarboy27> Unless the person is hilariously good at the game
<NewDCD> 9because DAT KAMEN RIDER PARODY
<mib_f4fwza> That... looks a lot like wing zero
<mib_f4fwza> but me not good at Mecha lore
<Bjornfot> HOLY SHIT APPLE_BLOOM, you weren't exaggerating... much

<Bjornfot> It almost didn't follow the CMCs thoughts any.
<Solarboy27> Yeah, it's impossible
<Purple`Prose> They're Dimensional Beasts
<ValtheJean> have you ever played a game with just one mech on its own, getting all the exp?
<Bjornfot> Cupcakes is... psychologically better, but this sure beat it graphically.
<Aaron8777> so we talking over 9000?
<Purple`Prose> I love how they're fighting extradimensional horrors and are like 'Meh, NEXT'
<Bjornfot> Also, why do i have a boner?

<Solarboy27> Oh jesus, that is one big mecha
<NewDCD> 9also: Alpha Gaiden
<NewDCD> 9â—¦ Took a Level in Badass (EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY Shinji Ikari, who goes from the whiny brat he was in the series in the first game to a Genre Savvy Ace Pilot Badass that becomes a Big Brother Mentor to Kira Yamato in the third.
<mib_f4fwza> Hey Gundam seed.
<NewDCD> 9Pet the Dog (In Alpha 3, after beating the EVA 01's copy, Gendo Ikari tells his son he actually wanted to comfort him, but never had courage to open up. Before he dies, he finally tells Shinji he's glad to see his son grow into such a strong man)
<mib_op5fno> was up?
*Kosoveon throws his stockpile of nuclear missiles at the chat, causing a chain reaction that destroys all life in the solar system

<Riders> Ahh, SEED Destiny, that's why I didn't recognize him. I'm still trying to erase that abortion from my memory
<mib_dstpct> god that's so awesome, lol
<Purple`Prose> Actually, Celestia, Luna and one other would pilot Aquarion
<Purple`Prose> it's a combiner
<Purple`Prose> Celestia, Luna, Twilight
<Solarboy27> Yeah
<NewDCD> 9Celestia, Luna, and Spike

<mib_k6abbd> i actually liked it when it wasn't shitting on me
<ValtheJean> Even though I wasn't promised it, I demand Talgeese!

<mib_k6abbd> sweet
<Riders> Okay, I get it, you have boobs.
<Darken_Skye> I love the class/race system in FFTA and everything but I could do without the judges.
<Purple`Prose> THIS NEVER SEEMS TO HIT ATTAAAACK!
<mib_k6abbd> damn, bitch can't aim
<Darken_Skye> well she does seem to telegraph the attack
<Purple`Prose> Well, she is throwing a giant shuriken with her skinny robot arms
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<Purple`Prose> at Real units, which are known for their agility
<mib_k6abbd> true, why the hell would she decide that's better than a gun
<Aaron8777> because he has troll dodge
<Purple`Prose> Can we finish her with the Satillite Cannon?
<NewDCD> 9more like I know how to utilize Spirit Commands/Seishin effectively to not get hit frequently
<mib_f4fwza> She one of the villians?

<mib_k6abbd> yup, she's dead
<mib_k6abbd> lol
<Johnn4523> Luna needs to get that cannon so the new lunar republic can win
<Darken_Skye> someone needs to tell these pilots that its shoot from the hip not shoot for the hip
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<wolfinponysclothing> i aim for the head my self
<NewDCD> 9"Luna! Eina! Put the Sol Graviton Spiral Crusher Punch on Standby!"

<mib_4xdpgh> i was promised ponies :(
<Bjornfot> For the New Lunar Super Robotic Republic!
<mib_nqc7tb> you missed them
<Purple`Prose> Imagine the marvel universe, but replace it with mecha shows
<NewDCD> 9we aired ponies earlier
<NewDCD> 9you're late brah
<Johnn4523> we're watching robots do freakin robot battles
<mib_4xdpgh> bah stupid work hours
<NewDCD> 9we're watching Giant Robots
<mib_f4fwza> "actually... Wouldn't the hips be close to were the Engine of robots would be.
<mib_4xdpgh> i can see that

<NewDCD> 9here
<NewDCD> 9BANISHMENT TO THE MOON PUNCH! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgvQgHIbF-U
<mib_f4fwza> I just sent a friend that doesn't like ponies this link cause he LOVES MECHA
<Riders> It's a shame Megas XLR isn't bigger universally because I would kill to see Megas in one of these games
<Darken_Skye> youd think they would want to shoot for the chest in an attempt to take out the pilot
<ValtheJean> Megas in SRW would be FUCKING EPIC
<EdwardNewgate> I did so love Megas XLR
<wolfinponysclothing> same megas kicks ass
<Purple`Prose> They're showing Megas tommorrow
<NewDCD> 9DAMMIT BRO HOW COULD YOU GET HIT HE HAD 11% HIT CHANCE
<ValtheJean> he needs to have his ultimate be "teleport a soda bottle to your enemy's computer"
<Purple`Prose> slurpee
<NewDCD> 9TRANS-AMU!
<Riders> Tension in battle?! What a revolutionary concept!
<Purple`Prose> TRANS AM!
<Purple`Prose> Going RAINBOOM!
<Johnn4523> show the robot monster no mercy
<mib_k6abbd> I'm confused, why are they talking about Trans-ams now
<Aaron8777> no this more like road kill
<mib_k6abbd> is that who makes gundams in the future?
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<mib_f4fwza> Anybody here ever use ponies as a penalty game in bets?
<Purple`Prose> The TRANSAM is that Gundam's 'super mode'
<Purple`Prose> basically turns it into Rainbow Dash
<EdwardNewgate> No, I use them as rewards
<Aaron8777> no the bet was ponys
<NewDCD> 9Trans-AM
<Aeroslash> get your own damn box
<NewDCD> 9is basically a Sonic Rainboom
<Purple`Prose> Trans-AM
<Riders> A reality where the whiny teenage psycho bitch sucks up her issues and marches to combat. I approve
*Aeroslash takes Chees-it's and runs
<wolfinponysclothing> meto
<Aeroslash> *z
<NewDCD> 9there's even a picture of RD using Trans-AM
<wolfinponysclothing> ouch that had to hurt
<mib_k6abbd> holy tits, actual damage
<Purple`Prose> Reals can't really take hits
<Riders> Damn, she's close to dying in this reality too.
<Purple`Prose> That's more Super Robot territory
<mib_f4fwza> I had a bet were my friend had to watch ponies if lost a pokemon doubles battle
<Purple`Prose> Reals are good at DODGING
<Riders> Dat Cleavage
<wolfinponysclothing> good by robo dino
<EdwardNewgate> Playing pokemon seems like torture enough
<Purple`Prose> I love how it explodes, then implodes
<Purple`Prose> so in a way, it's exploding twice
<Aaron8777> i watch the first five ep of romeo x Juliet juan watch first five of mlpfim to see which is better guess who won?

<NewDCD> 9CELESTIA'S BEING
<mib_k6abbd> hmm... think i'll just check back in ten minutes, see if you are on the next level
<mib_f4fwza> I won that pokemon battle... because I sure as hell didn't want to watch 8 golf tounements
<wolfinponysclothing> yeah golf sucks to watch
<VicRattlehead> its pretty awesome, it makes fun of all the RD fics where she gets killed off
<wolfinponysclothing> not to bad to play
<EdwardNewgate> HOLY FUCK
<EdwardNewgate> 8 TOURNAMENTS?
<EdwardNewgate> You realize how long that is?
<mib_f4fwza> I had to uneven the scales of the punishments to get him to agree.
<Aaron8777> as long 5 moon banishments this game?
<FeatherWIngs> Huh? SRW?
<EdwardNewgate> That's not punishment that's fucking torture.
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly though, do you even realize how long ONE tournament is?
<mib_f4fwza> Well my friend doesn't like ponies

<EdwardNewgate> 0I saw
<FeatherWIngs> The ponies beg for mercy when pinkie pie sings XD
<Riders> I love these dodge animations. As if missing the attacks missing wasn't insult enough, the targets practically flip the bird off to the ones their opponents while doing it.
<Kosoveon> !umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to Kosoveon for 19 minutes
<Umbreon> 12nooooooooo
<Kosoveon> that just never gets old for me :)

<Aaron8777> master spark?
<Purple`Prose> Gravion: When your giant robot has 'Super-Heavy God' in the title, you know you're big
<Riders> I don't know what's going on story wise but I'm sure it's epic.
<mib_k6abbd> whoa, that was pretty cool
<Kosoveon> :<
<Purple`Prose> Basically: Dimensional collapses and all that
<Kosoveon> sorry...I can be quite insensitive sometimes :(

<NewDCD> 9no, it's from Dancougar Nova
<ValtheJean> I was totally about to love you
<ValtheJean> and you....you broke my heart
*NewDCD 9trollfaces
<NewDCD> 9just as plan
<NewDCD> 9in all seriousness Caramel would probably be Balzac from SRW J
<NewDCD> 9because of this legendary line
<NewDCD> 9"After this is all and over with, I'm going back to the farm!"
<ValtheJean> haven't gotten the balzac yet
<ValtheJean> ....
<ValtheJean> one of these days dcd
<mib_f4fwza> That's more of a Big Mac line
<ValtheJean> I'm going to drive over to panama
<NewDCD> 9but it's cool how he mentions it
<NewDCD> 9it's like
<ValtheJean> and shove that shoe of yours so far up your ass
<NewDCD> 9OHAI I'M FUCKING YOUR SHIT WITH THIS FERMION CANNON
<NewDCD> 9WHILE MUSING ABOUT GOING BACK HOME
<mib_nqc7tb> What are those creatures?

<NewDCD> 9Balzac is actually kinda cool once he stops being a dick
<ValtheJean> until then, you remain my arch-enemy
<NewDCD> 9aside from the unfortunate name
<NewDCD> 9also: Getter Robo Armageddon's Invaders
<NewDCD> 9...goddamn it
<NewDCD> 9I made a pun with his name unintentionally
<EdwardNewgate> 0I see no bad fortune in having the name Balzac. I would love to have that name
<lgl> FUCK YOUR TENTACLES, MONSTER. I HAVE GUNS.
<NewDCD> 9but yeah Balzac is cool
<mib_f4fwza> is that solid snake?
*Gopher starts a conversation

<Purple`Prose> Here comes ZERO
<lgl> lolNOPE
<NewDCD> 9Balzac is a cool name
<Purple`Prose> GO NIRVASH!

<EdwardNewgate> 0Balzac is best name
<Dermathil> ALRIGHTY EVERYBRONY.
<lgl> that...that's a robot on a hoverboard.
<Dermathil> 1:45AM in the morning.

<Drake> 04You are seriously dedicated.
<mib_f4fwza> Disgaea Plays faster.
<Riders> Bokurano is not a crowd series. That's one that you watch on your own so you can cut yourself in privacy as you're reminded of how shitty existence is
<Sumica> it's Michal bays new screen play.
<Gopher> how so
<mib_nqc7tb> That's because the animations don't take as long
<rapidash> Sumica I could see that happening.
<Gopher> because I plan to make 1298+ sprites?
<NewDCD> 9SUDDENLY
<Purple`Prose> Bokurano is the Anti-MLP
<mib_k6abbd> so is this game like Fire Emblem where if they die in the game they die forever?
<Sumica> only death is plot
<NewDCD> 9OH GOD
<Riders> I saw Kira!!
<NewDCD> 9OH YES
<NewDCD> 9OH YES OH YES OH YES OH YES OH YES
<Gopher> because formes
<Sumica> derp eyes
<NewDCD> 9SUDDENLY
<NewDCD> 9THE REAL
<EdwardNewgate> 0Honestly DCD.I'm recommending Bokurano be the first new series put in. Most likely after Megas ends
<NewDCD> 9GENUINE
<lgl> DEM DERP
<NewDCD> 9TRUE
<NewDCD> 9DANCOUGAR
<Riders> Strike or Strike Freedom?
<Gopher> no idea what I'm gonna do with the unown things
<NewDCD> 9YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Purple`Prose> DANCOUGAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
<NewDCD> 9OKAY BOYS
<NewDCD> 9TIME FOR YOU TO PUT YOUR SYNTH GENERATORS AT FULL POWER
<NewDCD> 9CAUSE WE'RE GOING 80'S, BABY!
<Drake> 04Spriting that many images takes alot of time and dedication. Thus, you are very dedicated to have done as much as you already have.
<Sumica> takijng it up to 11 again?
<lgl> MY BODY'S NOT READY
<mib_k6abbd> but Big O... and Gurren...
<Purple`Prose> CODE! D-A-N-C-O-U-G-A! DANCOUGA!
<Drake> 04Kudos to you.
<lgl> =C
<NewDCD> 9YAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTE
<Gopher> well it doesn't take as much time as it might seem
<NewDCD> 9YARUZE!!
<drf|laptop> 03hah, finally someone admits it
<Drake> 04I know, but still - that many.
<mib_f4fwza> But if we get a chance to stream Disgaea, I'd love to see the Prinny Dance special move.
<Gopher> I made almost all of the okamidex so far in like two weeks
<Sumica> DA MAGICS!
<Drake> 04How much time do you put in to spriting each day?
<Gopher> it depends
<Drake> 04I don't sprite very often anymore, so yeah.
<Riders> Ahh super robot anime, the only thing about 80s animation other than Don Bleuth that didn't suck.
<Purple`Prose> Original Dancouger is on our side now
<mib_f4fwza> Send out BIG O!
<mib_f4fwza> What about Thundercats!
*ValtheJean is still waiting for Talgeese :P
<Riders> Especially Thundercats
<Gopher> I usually have to be a perfectionist and fix every tiny mistake I find just to realize that it looked better before I 'fixed' it
<Gopher> so that makes the sprites take more time than they should
<Riders> SHOW TIME!!
<Sumica> I had a co worker we called big-O
<Gopher> but prolly like 20 minutes each
<Gopher> give or take
<Purple`Prose> CAST IN THE NAME OF GOD!
<Drake> 04Ah
<Purple`Prose> YE NOT GUILTY!
<CAKEBOSS> YE NOT GUILTY
<Gopher> well if I reshade or add markings that is
<mib_k6abbd> awww yeah
<Gopher> or fire for that matter
<mib_f4fwza> And the thing that looks like a rock was kaboomed!
<mib_f4fwza> what show is this?
<mib_f4fwza> robotic
<mib_f4fwza> *robotech
<Purple`Prose> EAT SKY DRAGON CANNON
<Gopher> why am I being interviewed with formalities and such
<Gopher> it is making me nervous
<mib_k6abbd> mother fucking awesome
<mib_f4fwza> wooooooO!Wooooo! Wooooo! Sparklely!
<Darken_Skye> not robotech
<NewDCD> 9that was Dancougar
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04Just wondering really
<Sumica> Nanoha should be in this, she is praticaly a gundam herself.
<mib_f4fwza> this is a gundam seed right?
<Drake> 04It usually takes me 40 minutes to make a sprite, but then I procrastinate alot
<NewDCD> 9no, this is Gundam X
<NewDCD> 9aka BEST GUNDAM SERIES
<NewDCD> 9don't confuse it with SHIT and SHIT Density
<CAKEBOSS> SECOND BEST
<Purple`Prose> Nanoha isn't gundam-sized
<CAKEBOSS> TURN A
<mib_k6abbd> lol
<CAKEBOSS> *TURN A IS BEST
<Sumica> she's a prototype.
<Gopher> I usually cba to use an actual playlist and take a minute or two to choose which song I want to listen to once one ends so
<Riders> I resent that. Seed is great.
<mib_f4fwza> Seed was last gundam I ever saw... sorry.
<Gopher> that adds to time as well
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9SEED was decent
<Purple`Prose> Here comes ZERO
<applejackismaiwaifu> this pleases me
<Gopher> I should probably practice scratching more
<NewDCD> 9but it became the shittiest shit on SHIT Density
<Gopher> so I can like
<Gopher> work for a video game company thing later in life
<NewDCD> 9and Kira became and unlikeable Jesus Mary Sue
<NewDCD> 9Assram was just as bad
<Kaempfer> Pfft, everyone knows Zeta is the best. /UCElitism
<Gopher> because my parents keep bothering me about what I'm gonna do when I grow up and how I'll make money and whatnot
<EdwardNewgate> 0I'm sensing some hostility
<applejackismaiwaifu> what is this game?
<Gopher> and actual effort that I don't enjoy in any way at all ewww
*ValtheJean casually inserts Talgeese reference because he can
<Gopher> so yeah
<Purple`Prose> Clearly, you're forgetting about G Gundam
<Purple`Prose> It's Super Robot Wars Z
<Purple`Prose> 2
<Riders> SEED Destiny is in the same space as the Star Wars Prequels, the Matrix Sequels, and season 2 of Darker Than Black. It didn't happen
<applejackismaiwaifu> looks pretty badass
<Sumica> this hand of mine.
<Kaempfer> *Brohoofs ValtheJean*
<NewDCD> 9well, X is best traditional Gundam
<mib_f4fwza> G Gundam was so corny it had funny narm charm.
<applejackismaiwaifu> is burning red
<Drake> 04Heh
<NewDCD> 9and Z is best UC
<CAKEBOSS> Turn A>X>Victory>G>Wing>Z>MSG>ZZ
<NewDCD> 9and so on
*ValtheJean Brohoofs Kaempfer
<Drake> 04I could never do art/spriting for work.
<Drake> 04I'm extremely fickle about when I want to do it
<applejackismaiwaifu> Turn A looks pretty gay
<applejackismaiwaifu> the mobile suit I mean
<NewDCD> 9Riders: only that supposedly they fixed the shit out of SEED Destiny in the original SRW Z
<Gopher> these are the best scratches I've ever made
<CAKEBOSS> applejackismaiwaifu: YOU TAKE THAT BACK
<Gopher> and they're not even that good
<Gopher> http://www.iaza.com/work/110813C/iaza11842839622500.gif
<Gopher> derp
<Sumica> the only thing cool to come out of darker then black 2 was that gun.
<CAKEBOSS> THE MOONLIGHT BUTTERFLY WILL FUCK YOUR SHIT UP
<mib_f4fwza> Mezinger?
<CAKEBOSS> ok, moonlight butterfly sounds kinda gay
<ValtheJean> so out of curiosity DCD, will I actually get to see Talgeese at some point this stream, or will it only appear much later?
<Kaempfer> Though, honestly I've never seen Gundam X, so I'm looking forward to that
<Riders> I'm partial to 0080 and 8th MS team myself
<ValtheJean> GAH
<ValtheJean> MAZINGER
<ValtheJean> KILL IT
<applejackismaiwaifu> @cakeboss eeyup
<ValtheJean> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<CAKEBOSS> But it will still send you back to the stone age
<Purple`Prose> Ohhh, it's the NEW Mazinger
<NewDCD> 9and Shinn was actually pretty cool since he was Kamille MKII, only that then came the show takeover...
<mib_f4fwza> NEO MONSTER ISLAND!
<applejackismaiwaifu> it was pretty overpowered don't you think?
<drf|laptop> 03wtf is iaza.com
<NewDCD> 9oh Nia
<NewDCD> 9y u so moe
<Gopher> it is an image thing
<applejackismaiwaifu> Yoko>Nia
<Gopher> like
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Riders> Throw a galaxy at him!
<Gopher> photobucket and stuff
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<CAKEBOSS> Late UC is best UC
<Gopher> I thought that'd be obvious
<drf|laptop> 03I didn't actually click on it :P
<drf|laptop> 03but I saw /work
<drf|laptop> 03and was like what
<Sumica> ouch
<EdwardNewgate> 0That thing has a sword coming out of its stomach
<mib_f4fwza> line 10 Drink Beer line 20 Rocket Punch line 30 Back to line 10
<Kaempfer> Agreed, CakeBoss
<CAKEBOSS> Kaempfer: F91 4 lyfe?
<Gopher> fff
<Gopher> it is 2 AM
<drf|laptop> 03yep
<Gopher> I probably won't sleep tonight
<Gopher> maybe
<drf|laptop> 03and I need to get up at 9
<Sumica> So I take it the VF 6 sucks newdcd
<drf|laptop> 03fun, eh?
<mib_f4fwza> OUCH!
<Gopher> I've been trying to fix my sleep schedule
<NewDCD> 9using a shield like a sword
<NewDCD> 9like a baws
<Kaempfer> Actually, I've just started watching Gundam and haven't gotten that far yet :P
<applejackismaiwaifu> how do you do that random number meter thingy?
<Gopher> but I'm not very good at this
<applejackismaiwaifu> I used to be able to do it but it's been so long
<Sumica> I dont think you can till they bring back magnet.
<applejackismaiwaifu> awww
<drf|laptop> 03off to bed
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<drf|laptop> 03or at least off IRC, I might work on building my desktop more
<NewDCD> 9not till monday
<Sumica> people spamed it like crazy during the first movie so they booted it.
<Kaempfer> Considering waiting until Unicorn finishes, but that'll be a while
<applejackismaiwaifu> Leverage, anyone?
<mib_f4fwza> Would it be awefull if they added Megazord to this game?
<Gopher> also I just realized
<applejackismaiwaifu> want
<Gopher> dirge forme Contra looks like she's flipping you off
<Sumica> Voltorn, just not car one.
<Kaempfer> Hehehe, not at all
<applejackismaiwaifu> original megazord only
<Purple`Prose> Not really
<Gopher> she's supposed to be holding her hand out
<lgl> That guy has a scar, obviously he must be a bad ass
<Purple`Prose> Voltron was in one of the games
<lgl> [s]has no idea[/s]
<applejackismaiwaifu> Optimus Prime /game
<Kaempfer> Well, I'm out my Bronies, gonna go eat
<CAKEBOSS> Unicorn won't finish for another year. why wait?
<Sumica> Really?!
<ValtheJean> lol I can picture it now
<ValtheJean> SUDDENLY: "GOKAI GALLEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOON!"
<wolfinponysclothing> not so im coverd in scars and im not badass
<Kaempfer> Continuity, CakeBoss, continuity
<NewDCD> 9SCOOTA BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMU
<Sumica> badass in training
<lgl> But is it a bigass face scar?
<Kaempfer> Really going now, ta bronies
<lgl> That's the one that matters
<wolfinponysclothing> true
<applejackismaiwaifu> anyone else glad Bandai is finally releasing mobile suit gundam on DVD
<applejackismaiwaifu> with JAPANESE AUDIO!!
<CAKEBOSS> F91 and Victory are completely detached from Unicorn
<wolfinponysclothing> mine are on my legs and arms
<mib_f4fwza> Grimlok in this game would shoot lasers whenever he roared.
<CAKEBOSS> F91 and Victory make up the late UC, which feels like an AU
<NewDCD> 9KNOT BUSTER INCOMING
<NewDCD> 9TIME TO FUCK THAT FRACTAL KNOT
<CAKEBOSS> esp. compared to mid UC, which is still very closely tied to early UC
<Gopher> I shall try to sleep now
<applejackismaiwaifu> nut buster!
<ValtheJean> BAAAAAAAAA BABA BAAAAAAAAAAA BABA BAAAAAAAAAAAAAA BABA BARARARARARARAR
<mib_f4fwza> OW MY BALLS

<Drake> 04I'm an idiot

<NewDCD> 9King Gainer

<mib_f4fwza> monolog then ass kicking
<Ascendant> heh
<Darken_Skye> Big O looks really weird in SD
<mib_f4fwza> Don't remember him having a Gatling gun
<mib_f4fwza> thing...
<Purple`Prose> King Gainer was made by Tomino
<Purple`Prose> during one of his happy times
<wolfinponysclothing> dont use it much in the show
<Purple`Prose> DRILLLLL!
<applejackismaiwaifu> wait, you mean LELOUCH IS ZERO?!?!?
<Purple`Prose> Yes
<applejackismaiwaifu> When did that happen?
<mib_f4fwza> he alwasy was!
<NewDCD> 9uh, since the start of that animoo?
<mib_unwm8f> OH GOD THATS NEWS TO ME
<Purple`Prose> Hail the black King
<mib_unwm8f> :P
<FlutterHi> hello

<ValtheJean> howdy flutterhi
<Sumica> go scoots go
<mib_f4fwza> Uh... how many episides of Code Gease did you watch.
<NewDCD> 9wait didn't I have Suzaku as a selectable unit before this
<NewDCD> 9...I think he left us due to the Euphemia incident
<applejackismaiwaifu> the whole thing...
<applejackismaiwaifu> sarcasm is lost in text
<Sumica> spinzaku
<mib_f4fwza> oh....
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<mib_unwm8f> lol
<mib_f4fwza> sorry

<applejackismaiwaifu> behold my magical fisting ability
<mib_f4fwza> LOL!
<mib_unwm8f> ouchies
<Purple`Prose> BOOM!
<mib_f4fwza> I was thinking that!
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9fuck yes
<NewDCD> 9I love Dancougar
<Sumica> blew hies nads out the back of his head.
<NewDCD> 9check out that awesome kill
<lgl> BIG O: PROVING THAT THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO KICK ASS, IS A GIGANTIC ROBOT FIST.
<CAKEBOSS> GIANT ROBOT BATMAN WILL FUCK YOU UP
<NewDCD> 9DOSE SNAPSHOTS
<mib_unwm8f> DEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHH
<mib_f4fwza> Now to slice that thing in half.
<Purple`Prose> MANLY OLDSCHOOL ROBOT ACTION
<applejackismaiwaifu> mecha really changed after Eva
<NewDCD> 9Dancougar basically was
<mib_unwm8f> dem surfin robots
<NewDCD> 9a Decon Recon Switch of the Super Robot genre
<Sumica> so how is he lifting with no trapar?
<Purple`Prose> Sheer Hotblood
<mib_unwm8f> no eva in this one?
<Purple`Prose> He says NO to Gravity
<NewDCD> 9not in this one. Eva was in MX and the Alpha series
<CAKEBOSS> Is it wrong that I just want to see some Satellite Cannon?
<NewDCD> 9OKAY BABES TIME FOR PONY PENETRATION
<Sumica> oh god, the eva timed attack from mx
<NewDCD> 9Cakeboss: it ain't, but in this game you have to wait five turns between Sat. Cannon usage, unlike in Alpha where I spammed the shit out of that
<Sumica> dont stop till you reach the back of it's teath newdcd!
<applejackismaiwaifu> insert Xena theme here
<Umbreon> 12night whoever might go to sleep
<NewDCD> 9I FUCKING LOVE THIS DYNAMIC KILL
<applejackismaiwaifu> I WILL RAPE YOU WITH LIGHT!!
<NewDCD> 9jUST SIT IN THE COCKPIT
<NewDCD> 9NOT GIVING A FUCK
<Purple`Prose> So chill
<mib_unwm8f> so yeah NINEBALL?
<lgl> EH, IN A BIG FUCKING ROBOT THAT CAN KILL ANYTHING. NOT A BIG DEAL
<Sumica> was that chain sword?
<Purple`Prose> KINGU! KINGU! KINGU GAINAAAAAAAA
<Purple`Prose> Yes
<Sumica> epic
<NewDCD> 9AMAZING!
<NewDCD> 9AMAZING ENERGY!
<Purple`Prose> A giant robot with dreads and a chainsaw sword
<NewDCD> 9PHOTON....BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!
<NewDCD> 9TAKE THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS!!
<applejackismaiwaifu> Mikuru BEEEEEEAAAAAMMMM
<mib_unwm8f> lol simple twist of a dial and PEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<NewDCD> 9"MAZINGER...FULL POWER, GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"
<Sumica> some one needs to use sword chucks too.
<NewDCD> 9"HOW'S THAT? IT'S THE POWER OF PHOTONIC ENERGY!"
<mib_unwm8f> its over 9000
<ValtheJean> huh
<Purple`Prose> Bitch, get yo ass into space
<ValtheJean> I have a new respect for Mazinger
<ValtheJean> I guess it helps that in this game he has something more than a fucking Boob cannon
<NewDCD> 9I love how Alto is only being stopped by the fact he's running out of ammo
<mib_unwm8f> yey macrooooos
<applejackismaiwaifu> so what's with all the nut shots in this game?
<Sumica> now if only we could get megas in one of theese.
<ValtheJean> GO VERITECH GO
<NewDCD> 9well
<NewDCD> 9cockpits are usually at chest level in mechs
<NewDCD> 9unless you're Jehuty, in which you are in the crotch
<NewDCD> 9the head is basically an overglorified optical/signal sensor
<Purple`Prose> Or Dolores
<CAKEBOSS> or Turn A - crotch
<Purple`Prose> Turn A's more of a Belt Buckle
<Sumica> would so love to see coops head slam the big red button attack.
<ValtheJean> but wouldn't it make sense to put the most important person in the harder to hit area?
<CAKEBOSS> or Psycho Gundam - Head
<applejackismaiwaifu> most armore
<Riders> I never did understand Kojima's knowledge of mecha anatomy
<ValtheJean> I mean...the chest isn't exactly the hardest part of the machine to hit
<applejackismaiwaifu> *armored
<NewDCD> 9so for a quick kill
<NewDCD> 9you should aim for the body
<CAKEBOSS> and isn't the Sazabi's cockpit in the head as well?
<ValtheJean> although I like this captain
<NewDCD> 9well consider the fact that
<ValtheJean> he aint got NOTHING on the Russian captain from the first season
<NewDCD> 9it's bigger hit area but also allows for better armoring
<applejackismaiwaifu> kinda reminds me of Kalinin from Full Metal Panic
<ValtheJean> I guess
<Sumica> oh damn I forgot about fmp mechs.
<applejackismaiwaifu> Get me the Arbalest!
<NewDCD> 9also the cockpit might be there
<NewDCD> 9but it's a relatively small area, relatively speaking
<NewDCD> 9I have Arbalest in SRW J
<NewDCD> 9it pwns
<NewDCD> 9I also have Bonta-kun and his attacks are hilarous
<ValtheJean> GET ME THE GOD DAMN TALGEESE
<Sumica> Loved how the arblast became a bit of a smart ass in TSR
<wolfinponysclothing> ok here one why do thay call it a cockpit?
<applejackismaiwaifu> Cuz only dudes were supposed to be there
<Darken_Skye> because of the nature of pilots?
<applejackismaiwaifu> otherwise they'd call it the box car
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Lyon

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Playing with Manly
<NewDCD> 9and make him unhittable
<Umbreon> 12lol
<ValtheJean> out of curiosity, is mobility just the mech's version of the evade stat on pilots?

<eXAKR> Pattyrick where are you?

<Gopher> .
<Drake> 04You're confusing me
<Gopher> no I haven't made it for the okamidex
<Gopher> I already made it for the DCDex though
<Drake> 04And it might have something to do with this new background making text hard to read
<Gopher> I know all about that
<Gopher> because I am a derp
<Drake> 04Do Grovyle for the Okamidex if you haven't done it then.
<Gopher> and have a multicolored background
<Gopher> but what for grovyle
<Drake> 04I have a dark purple one.
<Gopher> there are sixteen things I can do with it
<Drake> 04MAKE GROVYLE LOOK LIKE AMATERASU
*Drake dorks
<Gopher> oh
<Gopher> so brush god then
*Drake doesn't know all the terminology sorry
<Gopher> I have all the types listed under the spoiler for it
<Gopher> and they're linked to the first ones I made of those types
<Drake> 04I saw. I'm just lazy
<Pattyrick> Brb 'nother tunnel
<Drake> 04Kay
<Gopher> The types are Brush God, Divine Retribution, Snarling Beast, Infinity Judge, Trinity Mirror, Solar Flare, Devout Beads, Life Beads, Exorcism Beads, Resurrection Beads, Tundra Beads, Tsumugari, Seven Strike, Blade of Kusanagi, Eighth Wonder and Thunder Edge
<Gopher> /copypaste
<Ascendant> Yu-gi-oh is so much more interesting
<Drake> 04I don't understand most of them
<Gopher> no
<Drake> 04but eh
<Gopher> YGO has a horribly awkward art style
<Gopher> :c
<Gopher> also they're um
<Ascendant> Opinions.
<Pattyrick> Nvm, I was FOOLED
<Ascendant> Opinion.
<Drake> 04And trust NS to say a random line that may or may not incite a flame war on fandoms.
<Gopher> the names of all the weapons in Okami
*Drake hides
<Drake> 04ok
<Drake> 04so
<Drake> 04what should I draw?
*Drake needs to get out of this art block.
<Gopher> draw Contra
<Gopher> hurrr
<Pattyrick> A Lucario
*Drake saw Contra and thought of that Alien arcade game
<Pattyrick> Or maybe Kingda Ka
<Gopher> what
<Drake> 04And I'm not drawing Pokemon. Never.
<Gopher> no Contra is um
<Drake> 04I hate their style.
<Drake> 04So cartoonish.
<Gopher> hang on I linked to it earlier
<Gopher> [02:04:29] <Gopher> these are the best scratches I've ever made
<Gopher> [02:04:32] <Gopher> and they're not even that good

<Gopher> doop
<Pattyrick> KK's tower is an awesome thing to draw
<Gopher> oh wow I only slept like
<Gopher> less than 6 hours
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_III:_The_Alien_Wars
<Gopher> no wonder my eyes are so tired
<Drake> 04I haven't slept at all.
<Drake> 04But that might be justified as it's only 10pm here.
<Pattyrick> 2:14 PM hurrrr
<Gopher> I am in Florida
<Ascendant> [22:11:23] <Drake> And trust NS to say a random line that may or may not incite a flame war on fandoms.
<Ascendant> [22:11:25] <Gopher> the names of all the weapons in Okami
<Ascendant> Yugioh is older than okami
<Drake> 04I'm in the land down unda!

<Drake> 04/stereotyping
<Ascendant> ok

<Drake> 04You confuse everyone.
<Drake> 04Constantly.
<Pattyrick> Flo Rida
<Drake> 04I think it's fair for the universe to have some conphensation (spelling?)
<ctr> Regular expressions get easy after you get it
<Ascendant> Gopher, what do you mean?
<Gopher> what do you mean
<Ascendant> And ctr, yeah, but mIRC's syntax is kinda weird
<stripes> :p
<Ascendant> [22:11:09] <Gopher> YGO has a horribly awkward art style
<Ascendant> [22:11:16] <Gopher> also they're um

<Dermathil> hello everybrony
<Gopher> you actually need to look that up
<Drake> 04Sorry for not giving a crap about internet culture.
<Drake> 04I find it unecessary.
<Drake> 04NS is constantly berating me for it.
<Ascendant> ...You didn't know what an e-peen is?
<Drake> 04I do now.
<Ascendant> didn't

<Drake> 04Hello Armads
<Ascendant> I wonder what they're doing together...?
<Drake> 04They're with my sister
<Drake> 04At a friend's place.
<Drake> 04I highly doubt that
<Pegacorn> Ohai Barry
<Pattyrick> Lol Ascendant
<Pattyrick> You little dirty minded person, you :P
<Armads> I woke up before 8:00 on a saturday morning
<Armads> I want a refund.
<Pattyrick> I did, too
<Barry> How are you?
<Pegacorn> Fine,and you?
<Ascendant> Oh, Drake
<Barry> Good
<Drake> 04?
<Dermathil> Hey Pegacorn
<Pegacorn> Ohai Dermathil
<Barry> I'm writing up a My Little Pony crossover. I'll post the chapters if you want them.
<Dermathil> Yall seen the explaination about Spiderses on EqD?
<Quanyails> 7Well, I just found out that Europe resembles Kyurem.
<Dermathil> It is the pony equivalent of Half Life: Full Life Consequence
<Barry> I should warn you, it's a power rangers crossover
<Pegacorn> Dermathil,what are you talking about?
<Armads> o.o
<Barry> we're making this confusing
<Pegacorn> HL:FLC?Awesome!
<Dermathil> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/spiderses-dramatic-live-reading.html#more
<Dermathil> Spiderses is an horrible fanfiction.
<Dermathil> Probably the one that was worst written
<Dermathil> (orthographically)
<Dermathil> It is HL:FLC levels of bad writing.
<Dermathil> And there is already a dramatic reading of it
<Pattyrick> .____________________.
<Barry> Derm, do you mean even worse written than Cupcakes?
<Ascendant> Okay.
<Dermathil> By a lightyear.
<Drake> 04gnight everyone
<Ascendant> ):
<Barry> ah
<Armads> :(
<Pegacorn> Barry,never mention that fic again.
<Pattyrick> wow, that was fast
<Dermathil> Fail at writing Twilight's name in the first paragraph, example;
<Ascendant> Drake's quit message is more interesting than kyurem
<Pattyrick> D=
<Armads> lol
<Pattyrick> Kyurem?
<Barry> How about worse than My Immortal?
<Pattyrick> Resembles Europe?
<Dermathil> what's that?
<Pattyrick> o.o?
<Pattyrick> There must be
<Pattyrick> A PATTERN
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN2t5YvILw
<Armads> no, Europe resembles Kyuremm.
<Armads> -m
<Armads> Kyurem obviously came first
<Armads> and then they modeled Europe after it.
<Pattyrick> ohhhhh
<Ascendant> if ($regex($2-,[^abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-_.@\s]) == 0) { msg $chan Success! }
<Ascendant> why does that not work
<Pattyrick> I still don't know what Kyurem is
<Dermathil> listen to it.
<Dermathil> The dramatic reading is done HL:FLC style.
<Pegacorn> HL:FLC!YAY!
<Barry> My immortal is a very badly written Harry Potter fic
<Barry> grammar mistakes galore
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxyZaZlaOs
<Pegacorn> HL:FLC.
<Barry> what is this?
<Dermathil> "if we're gonna be spiders forever, let's have Spidersex!"
<Ascendant> and of course, I'm an idiot
<Armads> but we love you anyway
<Armads> :D
<Pattyrick> Cansomebody please explain it to me?
<Pattyrick> Indeed
<Pattyrick> Wb Quan
<Pegacorn> WEPON
<Armads> kyurem is a reallycool dude
<Armads> see what I did there
<Pegacorn> ZOMBIE GOASTS.
<Pegacorn> ZOMBIE GOASTS LEAVE THIS PLACE.
<Barry> Hi Silver
<Pegacorn> ohai Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> Hi.
<Barry> Oh, and Pegacorn... run for your lives!! The zombie goats will eat your brains!!
<Dermathil> Hey Silverscreen.
<Dermathil> You read Spiderses yet?
<Dermathil> Or even listened to the live reading?
<Pegacorn> its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys.
<Soital> 12I like Kyurem owo
<Dermathil> It is Half-Life: Full-Life Consequences levels of awesome.
<Dermathil> "if we're gonna be spiders forever, let's have Spidersex!"
<Pegacorn> faster like the speed of sound
<Pegacorn> WEPON
<Dermathil> "it was like a crunchy potato chip bag full of chips got throwed into an chainlink fence"
<Pegacorn> ZOMBIE GOASTS LEAVE THIS PLACE.
<Pegacorn> the pants were dead
<Pegacorn> Its time to end this ones and for all!

<Pegacorn> LOOK OUT BRO
<Pegacorn> NO
<Pegacorn> JOHN FREEMAN GET OUT OF HERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN
<Barry> Not to change the topic, but I found a Pony Music video set to Fastest Thing Alive
<Dermathil> Pegacorn, listen to the live reading of Spiderses.
<Dermathil> And think of HL:FLC
<Pegacorn> JOHN FREEMAN YELLED AT THE TOP OF LUNGS
<Pegacorn> John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.
<Pegacorn> lol
<Pegacorn> AND FOUND WEPON
<Pegacorn> lolwut
<Pegacorn> CRUNCHY POTATER CHIPS
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> this thing is INSANE
<Dermathil> we need NewDCD to make a dramatic reading of his own.
<Pegacorn> tl;dr
<Dermathil> just listen to the live reading, Pegacorn
<Pegacorn> tl;dl
<Dermathil> This. Is. Because. WE. ARE. SPIDERS!

<Dman> No, Pegacorn, no demoman >_<
<Dermathil> how are ya
<Dman> BRO!
<Pegacorn> i know
<Dermathil> Did ya listen to the dramatic reading of Spiderses?
<Dman> Good, good. Came back from my run not too long ago, t'was nice :3
<Dermathil> It is HL:FLC levels of awesome.
<Dman> aaaand i don't think so
<Dman> what is Spiderses aniways?
<Dermathil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN2t5YvILw
<Dermathil> it is more than a fanfic. It is an EXPERIENCE
<Pegacorn> It's stupid.
<Barry> Did you get the PM?
<Dman> Just got back - people mid siesta - i'll plug it into our hugeass soundsystem in an hour or 2
<Dman> Yh barry
<Dermathil> Pegacorn, it is as stupid as Full-Life Consequences.
<Pegacorn> Dermathil,somewhat stupider than FLC.
<Pegacorn> Because FLC is Half-Life.So it gets away with being stupid.
<FreezeFrame> I'm afraid of reading Spiderses just because of how hyped it is
<Pattyrick> Getring close to my destination
<FreezeFrame> I mean, that's a lot to live up to.
<Pattyrick> Gtg, bye! =D
<Pegacorn> Last time i got hyped for something,it was Transformers:Revenge of The Fallen.And we all know how much it sucks!
<Dman> Yea Demrathil what is spiderses about?
<Dman> :P
<Pegacorn> Wait,i got hyped for something else after that.It was Kick-Ass.And that was awesome.
<Gentlecolt> black screen is best pony
<FreezeFrame> Rarity is best pony
<Soital> 12Angel ~
<Pegacorn> FreezeFrame,umad?
<Angel_Espeon> 13LattÃ©~
<FreezeFrame> If I had art skills, I'd draw her on my purple & white Chucks
<Dorugamon> goodnight
<Ascendant> goodnight
<FreezeFrame> Nah, all of the mane six are awesome
<FreezeFrame> Rarity is just the best of the best.
<Armads> oh god
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight Ascendant :3
<Armads> I just found out "pronounciation" isn't a word.
*Armads mind = blown
<Pegacorn> In my opinion,Rarity is the worst of the six.
<Quanyails> 7ProNUNciation. :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol it's pronunciation
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Armads> THIS IS NEWS TO ME D:
<Armads> and goodnight
<Espeon> 06:3
<Armads> but STILL THIS IS NEWS TO ME
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's ok, I always used to think that dependent was spelled as 'dependant" up until recently |D
<Armads> lol
<Armads> It always bothers me when people confuse -ant and -ent endings
<Armads> like spelling existent as "existant"
<Dermathil> Dman, spiderses can't be explained in words.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Independent and Dependent are the only two words I got mixed up with xD
<Dermathil> It is too special for that to be possible.
<Pegacorn> I can explain Spiderses in a word.
<Dman> Dermathil - Bene. I will enjoy this
<Pegacorn> And that word is.....stupid.
<Dermathil> SHHHHH
<Pegacorn> Right behing you.
<Armads> I never had many problems with spelling things
<Armads> but pronunciation I'd have just never guessed XD
*Pegacorn is right behind Dermathil with the Spy's knife.
<Pegacorn> *behind
<Armads> because you don't pronunce things, you pronounce them
<Armads> wtf english language :(
*Pegacorn backstabs Dermathil
*Dermathil throws his jarate behind him.
*Dermathil dodges the backstab.
<Pegacorn> AAAAAAAH!PISS IN MY FACE!

*Pegacorn is bleeding
*Silverscreen 11grins as both Pegacorn and Dermathil turn a corner to find his sentry there ready to blast both to smithereens.
<Dermathil> that's because Dari setup a chatcap

<Silverscreen> 11Either Dari or the server itself.
<Pegacorn> GODDAMN SENTRY!
<Silverscreen> 11We aren't sure.
<Dermathil> Doubting it is the server.
<Dermathil> We could reach 250 before

<Dman> Pegacorn - Got it
<interior_gummy> google claims that it doesn't have ads based on religion, only to advertise christian dating at the top of the chat page
<Dermathil> interior_gummy
<Dermathil> I get an ad to visit Israel.
<Dermathil> I doubt it is religion-related.
<D_man> Barry - sent request for part 2 of fanfic

*D_man lowers his sword besides him, his face showing signs of discombobulation
<D_man> *sigh*, ok then, shuffle all ya want then, but don't scare me like that unless it's an emergency!
*D_man puts his sword away, and walks from the road to a nearby bench, sitting on it.

*D_man speaks lazily, without raising his head, due to disbelief.
<D_man> Oh really now?
<D_man> And do they wanna eat you? dance with ya? what is it this time?

<Aurora> hence my nickname toyosa, or as i called her DJ Toyo
<Aurora> because obvious reasons
<GGgala> i got "connection reset" the entire run of movie night >_<
<FreezeFrame> I want to see a cutie mark that's an integral operand
<Dermathil> GGgala
<Dermathil> that's because the movie night now has a max of 200 viewers in chat
<Dermathil> either dari or the server set that up
<GGgala> does that affect the server?

<Starbuck> Hello, BMN-goers. I was previously NewManiac but I decided to go by the name I post as on Ponychan.
<Dermathil> ah, welcome to BMN, Starbuck.
<Dermathil> Need some coffee?
<Dermathil> :3
<Starbuck> Never heard that one before!
<FreezeFrame> Or would you rather shoot a bunch of Cylons?
<interior_gummy> sweet, robot night
<Dermathil> >_>
<interior_gummy> giant robots are the second best hasbro product
<Starbuck> Never heard that one, either!
<SilverSonic> Lol
<Dermathil> no transformers ATM
<Starbuck> [/sarcasm]
<Dermathil> If we get to eventually watch transformers, they'll be the good shows.
<Dermathil> Like Beast Wars, I think.
<Flutteryay> So
<Starbuck> I was going to live stream fanfic reading until I realized it was 30 minutes 'til the movie.
<Dermathil> We will be beginning the Stream with Macross: Do you remember love, IIRC
<Flutteryay> I understand we're having a Giant Robot night?
<Dermathil> hey Hipster_Brony
<ValtheJean> ohai hipster
<Flutteryay> Which ones are we watyching? Gurren Lagann? Gundam? Evangelion?
<ValtheJean> lemme see if I can remember

<Hipster_Brony> 8 /afternoon
<ValtheJean> the Macross: Do you remember love
<ValtheJean> and...other things I can't remember >.<
<Dermathil> I think there's gonna be some Gundam
<Dermathil> Next Week though we have Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Gurren Hen
<Dermathil> as the robot movie
<Dermathil> (the first movie)
<Flutteryay> NICE
<Flutteryay> I love TTGL :)
<Dermathil> there are plenty of TTGL fans here.
<Dermathil> me included.
<Purple`Prose> 9:30 EST is 8:30 central, right?
<Dermathil> yeah, I think
<Flutteryay> My other name Pinkamina was really a Gurren Lagann reference but after the last "LOL PINKIE IS A MURDERER" joke got thrown at me I decided to change it
<Starbuck> What are we watching this week, besides Scott Pilgrim and robots?
<Purple`Prose> Monday is KAMEN RIDE
<Purple`Prose> KAMENRIDER*

<ValtheJean> ung...what was it called...something Earth...this Land Earth?
<Starbuck> This Island Earth?! Like in the MST3K movie?
<ValtheJean> creepy oompa loompa scientist movie from the fifties
<Starbuck> You forgot their giant foreheads.
<Silverscreen> I'm here.
<Anthony> back
<ValtheJean> ohai silverscreen
<Starbuck> Hi, Silverscreen!
<Dermathil> alrighty thanks Hipster
<FreezeFrame> Whoever is streaming should pull up the stream, then put the stream on the video capture.
<Dermathil> brb, showertime
<Starbuck> I just got an amazing idea! What if we mixed the Hub with Scott Pilgrim? Dan Vs. the World!
<Starbuck> It would be amazing!
<SirSprinkles> ...the quality thing is new... Oo
<PokeyPaint> 0ouo
<Starbuck> Oh hait, SirSprinkles.
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> so would anyone care if i didn't watch scott pilgrim b/c iv'e seen it so many times now.
<Starbuck> hai*
<Barry> Hi Sirsprinkles
<crono_flash> Konichiwa SirSprinkles
<Starbuck> We would not care, KAM1.
<crono_flash> I agree Starbuck
<SilverSonic> Ray, you tuning in :3
<Barry> Seconded
<Barry> or is it Thirded?
<ValtheJean> howdy sprinkles
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> i think its third
<Starbuck> Wait, Crono, what are we agreeing on?
<Barry> That we wouldn't care
<Barry> if KAM1 left before Scott Pilgrim
<D_man> Show in 20 mins?
<Barry> yep
<Barry> maybe
<Starbuck> Oh. I thought we were agreeing on my awesome crossover idea.
<D_man> ^_^
<Barry> I guess
<Barry> What crossover idea?
<Starbuck> Dan Vs. the World.
<Barry> That hasn't been done officially, yet?
<Barry> I mean, The Hub hasn't done just that?
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, DCD put it in 2 or 3 days ago
<FreezeFrame> There's been art of Dan vs. Equestria, but that's it.
<FreezeFrame> It's just Dan riding NMM
<Barry> I hope you mean on her back
<Starbuck> You expect there to be an official Scott Pilgrim/Dan Vs. crossover?
<Hipster_Brony> also, you know cross breeze from ponychan, right?
<Starbuck> Someone needs to make a Dan pony.
<Chimera> Mew
<EdwardNewgate> Cannot wait to hear Rex Reason's sexy ass voice
<Barry> Well, know, but since the show is called Dan Vs., I thought The Hub would have already done something like Dan Vs. The World
<Barry> no*
<SirSprinkles> Yeah.
<Starbuck> Oky.
<FreezeFrame> Yes, Barry
<Starbuck> Okay*
<Barry> Hi, Silverscreen
<Ziltoid> hi silverscreen
<Hipster_Brony> he applied to be a mod
<Starbuck> Hello, again, Silverscreen
<Hipster_Brony> i think we should fast track him tbh
<SirSprinkles> I'll have a look at it when I get the chance.
<crono_flash> konichiwa Silverscreen
<mazoot> Hi, Silverscreen

<Silverscreen> hi
<Silverscreen> 11Colored hi
<Starbuck> I've been listening to Meatloaf recently. Bat Out of Hell is an awesome album.
<Starbuck> Meatloaf, recently.*
<EdwardNewgate> inb4 Rex Reason's voice makes my day complete
<Hipster_Brony> well, his app is super short (at my urging)
<Hipster_Brony> but i know him really well, and he would be a really good mod
<SirSprinkles> As long as it's quality, I don't care how long or short the app is, tbh.

<CBrony29> More of a Brony Movie Afternoon for me
<crono_flash> I meant the episode and the newgrounds flash
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm just having issues with the setup. =/

<PeanutButterWolf> triforception
<drf|laptop> 03LOL idiot
<drf|laptop> 03guessed something about Kuwait
<Barry> Did anyone watch the power rangers episode The Mutiny part 3, and mistake one of Jason's lines for "Time to can that bitch"?
<Caligula_droog> 0we put a tv, in yo tv.
<RobotPinkie> Probably, Darf, but they won't
<mib_rwov4i> I think that Dr. Forehead is an alien. Anyone else think so?
<drf|laptop> 03when stuff like WWI still wasn't guessed
<HeavyMetalPony> That will be my new TV one day...one day
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yes
<Jon> Sexual tension.
<mib_rwov4i> yay
<EdwardNewgate> I think that Rex Reason is the sexiest motherfucker ever
<RobotPinkie> She's sorry she what now?
<mib_rwov4i> NOONE'S AS SEXY AS GASTON
<EdwardNewgate> Anyone else agree?

<RobotPinkie> I'M sorry he's wearing pants.
<HeavyMetalPony> I agree mib_rwov4i
<Caligula_droog> 0so in the future our tv's will be uglier, shaped like the missing part of the triforce, and make noises like a lethargic opera singer?
<PeanutButterWolf> Line?
<Barry> @mib_rwov4i, I won't make any agreements or disagreements until I get more information
<EdwardNewgate> WHAT ABOUT PLAN B
<HuffytheMagicDragon> at least he don't have a klingon forehead
<mib_rwov4i> Okay Barry
<PeanutButterWolf> I do say, old chap.
<HeavyMetalPony> Plan A: getting a smaller forehead
<HuffytheMagicDragon> these tweeds are rather smashing
<Jir> needs more hats
<Jon> FANCY SHINY PRETTY!
<Darf14> Plan A? that's the plan that's more likely to fail, go to plan B instead it works 80% of the time
<EdwardNewgate> Why IS his head so BIG?
<PeanutButterWolf> More tea, Mr. Bike?
<RobotPinkie> Brak is an onomatopoeia for when someone gets their forehead smashed into a wall.
<Caligula_droog> 0plan a is to sit around like a sir.
<Barry> If that fails, go to Plan C... RUN!!
<HuffytheMagicDragon> pretty pretty shiny shiny
<NightFurson> "Karb"?
<mib_rwov4i> This guy's like an older Jimmy Neutron
<Barry> Plan C is almost always run
<RainbowFox> That maid is so out of her league.
<PeanutButterWolf> Plan 9. Explode sunlight
<Jon> ...I feel like going to the store
<RobotPinkie> What's Plan Z?
<HeavyMetalPony> WHat about Plan I form Outer-Space?

<Jon> And buying myself a fluttershy toy like a boss.
<HeavyMetalPony> Plan AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Alchemy_Gold> No, plan 9 is raise an army of atomic zombies
<Jon> Problem is I don't have a car.
<Alchemy_Gold> Or something like that
<EdwardNewgate> WU TANG
<RobotPinkie> movie's called "This Island Earth"
<Barry> Plan Z is steal the king's or queen's crown and blame it on the burger joint manager, getting him imprisoned or executed in order to get his secret recipe.
<Caligula_droog> 0@alchemy_gold, No, plan 9 was to stop us blowing up the sun.
<Jon> ...
<HuffytheMagicDragon> intersting title, since most of the earths surface is covered in water
*Dermathil is still there

<PeanutButterWolf> I can see through her shirt

<Ghosties> He wants to promote it and ask if people would want to play as males in the game. If he gets a good enough response, he says he'll program them in
<Ghosties> <Bjornfot>: As you may know, I'm the programmer for the FiM Dating Sim. We now have a (temporary) website, and want everypony who would be interested in male characters (only female characters are planned as for now) to answer a quick survey. <Bjornfot>: dunno if it's really needed, not many on here today <Bjornfot>: it's just that i just finished it

<RobotPinkie> Getting stuttering, am I alone in this?
<Caligula_droog> 0sburb has been set in motion
<Maxaminus> Stream, why u no work?
<Ghosties> Either way, if I send him to Ponychan it'll more than likely get eat up by purists
<HuffytheMagicDragon> lol planet jackers?
<SirSprinkles> I'd REALLY have to look at it before giving it the okay, myself...
<Mazoot> Nope, RobotPinkie
<Ghosties> Well
<Ghosties> In that case
<Alchemy_Gold> NOR-MAL VIEW!
<mib_rwov4i> USE SOLAR ENERGY
<HeavyMetalPony> implying earth holds large quantities of Uranium :trollface:
<HuffytheMagicDragon> gewd timing
<CBrony29> LOL can fly a spaceship to Earth, can't create nuclear energy
<CriticKitten> ....they need uranium to fuel an ion shield to protect themselves from comets.
<jitterhoof> coffee!
<SirSprinkles> 6This movie has the BEST special effects.
<RainBroDash> 10we don't have to support it :P
<mib_rwov4i> Earth has lots of Uranium? BULLSHIT
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i agree lol
<Elky> can't be better than the ones of the 90s Dracula movie
<RobotPinkie> Entering the kiddie pool, watch for yellow clouds.
<Ghosties> That's why I'm gonna tell Bjornfot to try to put it up on Ponychan and see what people say
<mib_rwov4i> Also, New Hope had better special effects
<SirSprinkles> Just tell him to put it on Ponychan.
<Elky> which, by the way, is something we should definitely watch
<HeavyMetalPony> ^What?
<RainBroDash> 10granted, bjonfot has a good few friends here, so outside of stream time around the time it's released, we'll be talking about it in bronystate anyway
<Darf14> Remember in this movie lead = Uranium so they have lots of it in this backwards universe
<RainBroDash> 10it's on EqD if that helps
<SirSprinkles> If it gets eaten up, then I'll look into it.
<PeanutButterWolf> Movies from the 50's have poor special effects?
<Jon> Behold the worst planet ever.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i'm gonna say Nothing to Lose if i win this week

<SirSprinkles> Around the time it's released, RainBro.
<Darf14> Man, this planet sucks
<Elky> huffy: the lottery was yesterday
<Maxaminus1> Man, your planet is shit.
<SirSprinkles> I don't want to deal with it all the way up until that time.
<HuffytheMagicDragon> right i'm friendzzz w/ him on facebook?
<HeavyMetalPony> I know, but it sounded like you said it had bad special effects mib_rwov4i
<HuffytheMagicDragon> crap
<CriticKitten> But if they have lots of lead and can turn it into uranium, couldn't they just use a transmutation circle to get it done faster instead of triangular laz0r screens?
<Caligula_droog> 0meanwhile in amsterdam
<mib_rwov4i> >Equestria is best planet
<RobotPinkie> Well in this universe, science is horribly abused and left crying in the gutter.
<PeanutButterWolf> This planet needs to be condemned
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<SirSprinkles> Which is what happens when you allow yourself to be associated with something like that.
<RainBroDash> 10idd
<Darf14> I don't want to live on a planet that looks bad and is constantly exploding every 10 seconds
<Zecora> we need to protect our shitty planet
<HuffytheMagicDragon> spike quote!
<mib_rwov4i> @PeanutButterWolf I agree Spike

<Tommy_Wiseau> You are TEARING ME APART SilverSonic!
<RobotPinkie> I mean seriously, I did not remember the mattes and effects being this shit. Just look at something like Forgotten Planet, so much more awesome.

<Jir> Oh god WALL-E I loved that movie so much
<Caligula_droog> 0it just me or do the meteors sound like tom?

<mib_rwov4i> brohoof received HeavyMetalPony
<nickstr> this seems fitting
<Darf14> They are loosing a battle from a alien race that throws rocks at them at close range.....yes I know that they are comets
<Bjornfot> remote controlled comets are the best weapons
<Combustiblelemons> Y U NO BLAST METEORS OUT OF SKY
<HuffytheMagicDragon> yes cept it isn't covered in BUYN LARGES AND THERE AREN'T ANY CUBES OF TRASH ANYWHERE
<Combustiblelemons> Dumbass aliens
<Elky> WALL-E is the best pixar movie
<NightFurson> Bjornfot! Is that a "Sim" in Second Life, and is it related to MLP?
<PeanutButterWolf> RADIOACTIVE, Son
<CriticKitten> Their enemy uses hang-gliders as spacecraft, clearly they are a superior race to humans
<interior_gummy> best pixar movie=incredibles
<Caligula_droog> 0YOU FAIL AT SCIENCE FOREVER
<interior_gummy> BITCH

<RobotPinkie> Wow, a series of tubes.
<mib_rwov4i> logic over emotion

<Combustiblelemons> F=F-FALCON PUNCH!
<NightFurson> Before the chat flood, "I love the hipster chicks sexually"
<HuffytheMagicDragon> i call em combos- pinkie pie
<FreezeFrame> My theory: Everything after this is Scott's coma dream
<FreezeFrame> He was actually cold-cocked by the emo
<CBrony29> Patel's magic is weak yo, like Trixie
<PeanutButterWolf> Ghirahim from Skyward Sword?
<Fluttershy> o-o
<HuffytheMagicDragon> trixielol
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> CBrony29 BURN
<CertifiedBrony> Why does kim pine look so ugly compared to her graphic novel version?
<NightFurson> Freezeframe, that actually makes too much sense
<Umbreon> 12in a group of really great friends that i've known for a long time, then being given the cold shoulder
<Combustiblelemons> scotts got the moves!
<BlayzeKohime> Patel sorta acts like Trixie too
*Nick offers Umbreon some help then if he wants it
<RobotPinkie> This is so awesome that my balls hurt
<HuffytheMagicDragon> he got them moves like jagger
<Tiberius_friend> I never thought you could overact that much through body-movement
<Combustiblelemons> FLASH KICK!
<jitterhoof> realize that scott essentially kills 7 people in this movie
<Darf14> Good combo
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> Trixie needs to be able to summon hipster chicks in season 2
<HeavyMetalPony> I'm a pirate now, pirates are cool
<Umbreon> 12this is sadly something i have to help myself with
<Nick> yeah I was the same but towards the end they just treat me as a toy of amusement then got bored of me
<Bjornfot> YOU ARE A PIRATE
<Tiberius_friend> don't forget that crash and the boys die aswell
<FreezeFrame> I love how Scott's sister is like "everyone here is ca-razy"
<Combustiblelemons> SONIC BOOM!
<Darf14> You are a Pirate *yay*

<FreezeFrame> Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk.
<Ghosties> 4Nymphadora Tonks is the hottest chick in the Harry Potter films
<Darf14> Time heals all wounds, Quick call the nearest Doctor! We found a cure for EVERYTHING!!!
<PeanutButterWolf> At least Tonks' hair isn't green
<HeavyMetalPony> lol, gay guy who looks like he could beat you up is ten times nicer than other gay guy
<RainbowLoon> what's wrong with green hair?
<mobileDCD> I'd wreck Luna the most though
<mobileDCD> Cause she da cutest : 3
<PeanutButterWolf> These wounds they will not heal.
<Golden-Poundcake> its a rarity reference
<Elky> green hair lets you screw the rules
<Ghosties> 4Luna's alright
<Golden-Poundcake> i personally already have green hair
<Ghosties> 4But she's too much of an airhead
<HeavyMetalPony> Silly Ghosties, that's not how you spell Galadriel
<Combustiblelemons> Metalluna isn't alright though.
<Tiberius_friend> @elky, not as much as money
<Crainy> LOL
<PeanutButterWolf> And yet Kaiba was still able to screw the rule.
<Elky> well yes
<FreezeFrame> Ah, Wallace
<PeanutButterWolf> FAAAAABULOOOUS
<Ghosties> 4Galadriel?
<Ghosties> 4Don't remember Galadriel
<mobileDCD> I love me some well-intentioned, non-bitchy, not-actually-stupid airheads
<mobileDCD> Luna's more of a Space Cadet and less of an airhead, too
<RainbowLoon> FINISH HIM
<Golden-Poundcake> nah luna lovegood and hermione, the best by far
<Crainy> FINISH HIM
<Tiberius_friend> sounds a lot like the producers of this movie
<Sumica> so not the line the gay guy should be saying
<Elky> ...whatever
<HeavyMetalPony> PAWNCH
<Ghosties> 4Space Cadet? What?
<Elky> eh
<Golden-Poundcake> away with the farieis, etc.
<Ghosties> 4Luna's all kinds of spaced out, if that's what you mean
<Golden-Poundcake> fuck i need to learn how to type properly
<RobotPinkie> dat running
<Crainy> ..
<Crainy> haha
<Ghosties> 4She "has her head in the clouds"
<Tiberius_friend> SPAAAACEEE
<Darf14> man, he is good at solving passwords
<HeavyMetalPony> Luna seems alright to me
<mib_3hjydc> i love how all the passwords are correct
<jitterhoof> scott goes on a murderous rampage in 3...2...1...
<RobotPinkie> Great hipster passwords.
<PeanutButterWolf> monkey suit
<mobileDCD> Ghosties: it's how one describes those people that often have flights of fancy
<mobileDCD> Like Pinkie Pie
<Golden-Poundcake> bat
<HeavyMetalPony> Piss Poorgrilm
<Ghosties> 4You know, I never really realized it until last night
<Darf14> U NO LIKE COKE?!?!
<Ghosties> 4But this movie is incredibly hipster
<PeanutButterWolf> Coke Zero, now rubble
<Elky> what?
<Crainy> WITH YOU
<RainbowLoon> i'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum
<EdwardNewgate> I'd still fuck the shit out of Luna
<Tiberius_friend> castlevania music INCOMING!
<Elky> wait, you didn't realize that?
<RainbowLoon> and i'm all out of bubblegum
<RainBroDash> 10This movie is terribly hipstery :P
<Dermathil> !
<Golden-Poundcake> nah, its too mainstream to be hipster
<ValtheJean> well you know how those hipsters can be ;)
<PeanutButterWolf> "c'mon it's clear" O hai mark.
<Crainy> SCOTT EARNED THE POWER OF LOVE
<Darf14> He pulled a sword out of his chest....now that is origional
<Combustiblelemons> YOU SHALL NOT PASS
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> level up
<Ghosties> 4The weirder thing? I actually really, really enjoy this movie
<EdwardNewgate> also, I fucking hate how everyone thinks Duke Nukem came up with the bubblegum line
<HeavyMetalPony> Scott used stabby stabby stabby, it's super effective
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Elky> I wish they didn't have that much hipster appeal in this movie
<ValtheJean> oh wait hipsters not online...damn that was a wasted joke >.<
<interior_gummy> just figured out that noise is from sonic when you get a ring
<Sumica> hidden finger
<Ghosties> 4It was "They Live"
<RobotPinkie> ....wtf
<Elky> it makes it a 6-7/10 at most
<Ghosties> 4And it was Roddy Piper's line
<jitterhoof> go scott! KILL KILL
<Darf14> $$$$$
<PeanutButterWolf> It's more videogame than hipster
<RainBroDash> 10interior_gummy.. it took you -that- long? ;D
<Tiberius_friend> castlevania when the sword smashes
<Ghosties> 4Right after getting the sunglasses
<EdwardNewgate> I know, That's the movie I'll pick if i ever win the lotto
<Braindrainer> so much murder
<Aponymous> We need to watch They Live one week.
<HeavyMetalPony> Yes, it was They Live, but Duke perfected it
<Riders> You can make a movie about hipsters that isn't hipstery
<PeanutButterWolf> STRAWBERRY ON THE SHORTCAKE
<interior_gummy> RainBroDash...yes
<Darf14> Killing, totally acceptable
<GGgala> Revolutionary Scott Utena
<Crainy> the Pony Community is the best
<Golden-Poundcake> 3fed up of not being able to see my own messages, so colour change time!
<Elky> yeah, but hipsters have started stealing video games from the nerds
<Ghosties> 4The scene where Roddy puts on the glasses for the first time is one of the greatest moments in movie history for me
<Golden-Poundcake> 3or not...
<Elky> so yeah
<Darf14> man, that sword sucks
<DragonRage> Good afternoon, everyone.
<Combustiblelemons> dat cash
<Braindrainer> love sword fails
<Elky> inb4 no colors
<Purple`Prose> Suddenly, KNIVES

<ValtheJean> dari's script strikes again :P
<RainBroDash> 10silly interior_gummy, teal is for RBD mod
<Darf14> This girl is CRAZY!
<EdwardNewgate> chow down lol
<HeavyMetalPony> It's a Clockwork Orange reference?
<PeanutButterWolf> kung pow enter the fist
<FreezeFrame> Which means it doesn't stand out for me.
<Elky> so you get tw warnings before it kicks you?
<interior_gummy> 0looks like a bit of the old ultraviolence
<PeanutButterWolf> You're a lyra!
<interior_gummy> 0i'm a bon bon

<Bjornfot> Freezeframe, increase your contrast
<Riders> Yes there is a difference. It means that yoou're the 3rd wheel
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> GAME OVER
<Rodman> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX!
<Darf14> That's what you get for cheating you cheater Scott
<FreezeFrame> My contrast is fine
<HeavyMetalPony> Niel's in the five reaction page? Does not compute
<Ghosties> 4Actually, Gideon...
<Ghosties> 4HE CAN
<mib_3hjydc> THE END
<Elky> 0I just noticed that if they have more mods, finding new colors will be hard
<Contra> meow
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> colors are for hipsters elky
<FreezeFrame> Dark red against black is eyebleedingly little contrast
<Combustiblelemons> 1up.
<Purple`Prose> Welcome to Davy Jones's Locker
<Dermathil> 1-UP!!!!!
<Elky> 0eeyup
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Purple`Prose> Please watch out for Jack Sparrow
<Ghosties> 4I've thought about that Elky, and I have a solution
<RobotPinkie> Too obvious
<RainBroDash> 10Elky, don't make me get the banhammer: http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101124124322/scottpilgrim/images/c/c5/Ramona_strong-1-.gif
<Darf14> Hes the final boss that's why you got your ass kicked
<Sumica> double colors?
<PeanutButterWolf> evil triforce
<Rodman> He's just too sexy.
<Elky> 0and I thought you were gonna post the ham banner
<ValtheJean> the solution is obviously gladiator fight to the death between mods
<Riders> Purple`Prose = This can't be Davy Jones Locker. This movie is actually good.
<NightFurson> Evil villains can't triforce yellow.
<ValtheJean> two mods go in, one color comes out
<interior_gummy> 0we let commoners use colors (or make me a mod)?
<RainbowLoon> eeeeeeeevil way he eats hay
<Elky> 0it's a double color all the way across the sky
<PeanutButterWolf> Thank god Ganon doesn't have the evil Triforce
<Purple`Prose> RELOAD SAVE STATE
<Combustiblelemons> triforce... what.
<Golden-Poundcake> 0ganon is the greatest
<RobotPinkie> Triforce of daterape
<Rodman> So, Scott Pilgrim vs Being Dead?
<Darf14> NO check Points?! Man that sucks
<HeavyMetalPony> Dear Princess Celestia, I feel like I've learned something

<Darf14> Hey, a better sword
<PeanutButterWolf> BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE BROWNIE!

*Armads read that as "pink lemonade laptop"
<RainbowLoon> he read the walkthrough
<HeavyMetalPony> Riders, if only for that one panel in Book 4
<PeanutButterWolf> Reverse seppuku
<Armads> the visual was weird
<Ghosties> 4If it's implemented, then you'll get to see my plan in action eventually
<Darf14> Dejavu
<mib_g3y3nb> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Elky> 0I don't know if I should be scared
<Riders> HeavyMetalPony = If only for no Michael Cera.
<mib_vbpnvw> Comeau looks like Nick the I.T. guy from the office
<Bjornfot> SPOILER: Ramona is not a fatass.
<Tiberius_friend> Good guy scott: Cheats on two girls....Says he's sorry
<Purple`Prose> VERSUS!!!!!!!
<PeanutButterWolf> despite her fat arms, she's actually thin.

<PeanutButterWolf> Katanas are hipster?
<HeavyMetalPony> Gideon plays Fruit Ninja
<Ghosties> 4It's all about Scott becoming a decent person
<Crainy> Dear Princess Celestia, i have learned a valuable lesson - Scott
<RobotPinkie> FINAL FORM
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> WHITE TEXT IS SO MAINSTREAM
<Darf14> That Myth is Busted
<Ghosties> 4Gideon is Scott's foil, they really are opposites of the same coin
<RainbowLoon> you made me swallow my cum
<interior_gummy> 0SWALLOW MY CUM
<GGgala> >dat seinfeld
<Crainy> YOU MADE HIM SALLOW HIS GUM
<HeavyMetalPony> You should so. Totally. Cum.

<Crainy> honk
<Rodman> FUCK YO SWORD!
<Purple`Prose> PWN
<Tiberius_friend> HONK
<Crainy> moral of the story:
<Golden-Poundcake> 0scots swords all fail
<PeanutButterWolf> He totally isn't Tom Cruise
<Braindrainer> all his swords suck
<mib_g3y3nb> BAD
<Crainy> even self respect cant protect you from assholes
<interior_gummy> it's funny because it vaguely sounded like a reference to the comsumption of human ejaculate
<RainbowLoon> that's gonna HURT
<Bjornfot> CHECKHOVS GUN TIME
<HeavyMetalPony> Wattt
<ValtheJean> *slowpoke.jpg* Hey guise! Knives uses Knives in combat!

<Bjornfot> TWO. HOURS.
<PeanutButterWolf> Needs Pokemon's critical health music
<DragonRage> Hipster overload.
<Tiberius_friend> drunken post on craigslist!
<Purple`Prose> K-OH-OH-Oh-oh-oh....

<Rodman> DEM MONEYS!
<Tiberius_friend> dat coinage
<Braindrainer> quarters for everybody!
<Purple`Prose> Loonies
<Darf14> Too bad all of that XP is useless since they beat the final boss
<HeavyMetalPony> ate the coin
<PeanutButterWolf> Being manly in Canada means killing people.
<interior_gummy> THREESOME GODDAMMIT
<DragonRage> If only arcades still existed in more than five places in the US.
<Combustiblelemons> What's this?!? SCOTT IS EVOLVING!
<Ghosties> 4I still think Michael Cera wasn't the best choice for Scott Pilgrim
<ValtheJean> phhhf, Darf14, Newgame+ duh...
<Elky> 0well you can still do the sidequests
<Ghosties> 4At least I don't think he fits the look
<Golden-Poundcake> 0you cant get an actor thats more awkward
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> OH SHIT NEGASCOTT
<crono_flash> Nega Scott
<Bjornfot> NIGGA SCOTT
<Golden-Poundcake> 0nega scott
<NightFurson> Legend of Zelda Evil Twin: Always relevant
<Purple`Prose> SOLO ROUND!
<Ghosties> 4The guy who did Crash from Crash and the Boys would have been a much better fit IMO
<Darf14> Oh forgot Newgame+
<Crainy> why is he called nega scott?
<Riders> Ghosties = Preaching to the choir
<Elky> 0needs more goatee
<NightFurson> LOL
<PeanutButterWolf> Shadow Link > Dark Link
<Golden-Poundcake> 0didnt get to see that film :(
<Braindrainer> OMG it's CG micheal cera
<Tiberius_friend> slowpoke: the crack on the glasses is a 7
<HeavyMetalPony> Michael Cers is a perfect choice in my eyes, but I can't see Scott Pilgrim as a real person anyway
<DragonRage> Negative Scott.
<mib_b1c7vb> LOLWUT
<mib_g3y3nb> BONDING FOR THE WIN
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<Combustiblelemons> evil scott
<mib_b1c7vb> DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING XD
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> HAT OUTAA NOWHERE
<Golden-Poundcake> 0suddenly,. hat
<Purple`Prose> Normal Scott is a hipster douche, nega Scott is a generally decent dude
<Combustiblelemons> another triforce... what
<Darf14> If Link only talked to Dark Link then we wouldn't have to put up with that frustrating boss in Zelda 2
<jitterhoof> the benefits of a morally neutral character
<Riders> I'd have gone with Jesse Eisenberg or Joeseph Gordon Levitt as Scott
<DragonRage> "Nega/Negative" is one of the many, many words used for evil clones, doppelgangers, twins, and general lookalikes.
<Crainy> no ramona
<Crainy> dont go
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> NEGA SCOTT is too mainstream
<Ghosties> 4Scott actually becomes a good guy at the end of the series
<Ghosties> 4So, really, Nega Scott would be the Scott from the beginning of the film
<mib_vbpnvw> it's Neighhhga scott!
<HeavyMetalPony> Only think I don't like is that the movie strolls along for 2 hours, and then runs away with the ending in ten seconds flat
<Golden-Poundcake> 0this isnt a standalone film?
<Tiberius_friend> like 20 people died and became rubble for you woman..
<Crainy> is this the alternate ending :( ?
<Annomaniac> Nnnnope.
<Ghosties> 4The one thing I don't like, aside from Michael Cera being Scott Pilgrim?
<interior_gummy> reverse pedoscott
<crono_flash> For the movie no, for the series yes
<Golden-Poundcake> 0i would be pedoscott
<Elky> 0all that hipster shit?
<Purple`Prose> There's always New Game+
<Ghosties> 4It's still ScottxRamona
<WinstonChurchill> Ah crap, Big Brother is back.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> Scott pilgrim is Micheal cera, NEGA SCOTT IS JESSE EISBURG!
<mib_vbpnvw> Jonah Hill would've made a better scott pilgrim
<SirSprinkles> 6DAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<Riders> Knives feels like too much of a little girl
<ValtheJean> boooooo.....knives is better
<ValtheJean> she has knives
<mib_g3y3nb> DAT DOOR
<HeavyMetalPony> The Social Network for BMN
<RobotPinkie> True, she is way too cool for him.
<Crainy> aaawwwww
<Purple`Prose> Indeed
<PeanutButterWolf> Jonah Hill looks weird skinny
<Golden-Poundcake> 0ill be honest, im only here for the pony episode coming up
<DragonRage> Dawyne Johnson would... wait, no, forget I even said it.
<RainbowLoon> they have two Scotts, why not give each girl one of them?
<Golden-Poundcake> 0its one of my favourites XD
<Darf14> Oh **** I don't have a Quarter? Quick give me one!!!
<Ghosties> 4Any other hetero, canon pairing would have been better. ScottxKim or ScottxKnives would have been so much better
<interior_gummy> which pony to ship with scott?
<DragonRage> Dwayne*
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> hey guise should we contuniue?
<Tiberius_friend> quick scott, into the tardis!!!
<Darf14> Too late
*ValtheJean brohoofs Ghosties
<Jir> Dash ofc

<Bjornfot> ScottxWallace.
<Elky> 0sooo, what happens until 9:30?
<Purple`Prose> Scott deserves ponies
<mib_b1c7vb> Scott Pilgrim as a pony
<mib_b1c7vb> mfw
<PeanutButterWolf> I can't read the credits
*GGgala brohoofs Bjornfot
<DragonRage> Scott x Nega Scott

<SirSprinkles> 6ScottxYoung Neil
<interior_gummy> he can get the worst pony, twilight sparkle

<RainbowLoon> ScottxGilda, see, no pony
<Rodman> Ponies now please
<Purple`Prose> >.>
<NightFurson> Until 9:30, I take a massive piss
<Ghosties> 4I said hetero, Bjornfot :D And *brohoofs ValtheJean*
<Tiberius_friend> well, thanks for that, whoever streams these.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> Ghosties scott x knives was the alternate ending to this movie
<RobotPinkie> I'm agreeing with DragonRage here
<Riders> Ramona represents Scott maturing. Anybody else would have defeated the purpose of the journey
<ValtheJean> :D
<Bjornfot> Ghosties: Hetero is too manestream
<RobotPinkie> Scott x Nega Scott, they have so much in common
<mib_vbpnvw> fuck you twilight sparkle is awesome!
<mib_b1c7vb> I thought it was f****** hilarious when Scott and Nega-Scott became friends
<PeanutButterWolf> FIM needs an aloof douche pony.
<interior_gummy> i have yet to see a het fanfic of fim
<Bjornfot> aww yeah Scott x NegaScott
<Annomaniac> stop the swearing guys.
<ValtheJean> omg...my 6 month niece is over...brb I'm going to sing her the Dai-Guard intro
<jitterhoof> our credits, now blurry
<Combustiblelemons> bon-bon's a bitch.
<Rodman> PeanutButterWolf: It has. He's called Blueblood.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> we need more douche ponies
<crono_flash> I should totally edit the good deleted scenes in, along with the alt endding
<GGgala> Rarity's evil hipster geek twin, Obscurity.
<HeavyMetalPony> Blueblood is alpha as fuck
<interior_gummy> trixieXblueblood?
<PeanutButterWolf> He's never gonna be in the show again.
<Darf14> I know what would make this movie even better: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_liu7o8BY6P1qa2xemo1_500.png
<ValtheJean> That's a strange way to spell Caramel HeavyMetalPony :P
<Bjornfot> Blueblood is 120% gay.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> aww no image
<interior_gummy> gilda is dash's clingy ex
<PeanutButterWolf> Bonbon is a fatass... wait a minute
<Combustiblelemons> scott looks fat as a pony :S
<Rodman> But I agree, need more douche ponies to make fun of
<HeavyMetalPony> Well, this movie was my first reaction when I saw episode 5
<mib_vbpnvw> that explains why he treated rarity so badly!
<Combustiblelemons> notice bon-bon is a bitch though.
<crono_flash> too bad this track isn't in the game
<Elky> 0blueblood needs to return
<Combustiblelemons> yet fanonically she's well loved. lolwut.

<Gnorri> you're the banana king twilight!
<mib_vbpnvw> is this part of the episode?
<interior_gummy> sapphire shoresXhoity toity
<Combustiblelemons> I bet NewDCD was making gokai references when knives appeared
<GGgala> "this movie has been rated PG-13". So great to know that after it's over!
<Elky> 0also, blueblood's segment was freaking hilarious
<PeanutButterWolf> cumming
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> SO TWILIGHT IS A BITCH THAT LIKES BANANAS?

<Combustiblelemons> what episode is this?
<Bjornfot> Rarity just creamed herself.
<ValtheJean> @HeavyMetalPony indeed...tis a very sad thing
<verumdeus> jitterhoof fact
<interior_gummy> she lacks a cutie mark?
*Ray climbs onto Aero's head
<Ray> 02Hiii~

<RobotPinkie> So Elvis
<Aeroslash> :)
<Darf14> Needs more Diamonds
<DragonRage> She dyes her coat and covers up the cutie mark to make herself seem more youthful.
<PeanutButterWolf> and they they didn't forget Photo Finishes' cutie mark
<WinstonChurchill> Pony fashion is essentially: SHINYSHINYSHINY
<interior_gummy> rarity died
<HeavyMetalPony> Rarity, now rubble
*Aeroslash floofs out
<PeanutButterWolf> dat gait
<Bjornfot> Photo Finish has the exact same cutie mark as twilight
<Purple`Prose> dat clap clap
<RobotPinkie> Rarity, now marshmallows
<Anthony> why hello there.
<Anthony> Ray.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> jewels and gems are like aluminum in the pony world

<Anthony> may I has pm?
<HeavyMetalPony> Hardware Store? haha
<PeanutButterWolf> THE PONY OF POMP
<Bjornfot> Gay Stable? INTEREST PIQUED
<interior_gummy> she was jealous of fluttershy
<Crainy> ufff
<PeanutButterWolf> then who's the pony of circumstance?
<Darf14> She Contradicted Herself!
<Zecora> Gay stable on the rise ......
<Elky> 0mare: incredibly valuable in earlier times, but dirt cheap now?
<Crainy> never jealous?...
<jitterhoof> quite in ore
<Braindrainer> ah yeah, pony time
<Crainy> rarity is NEVER jealous???
<Gnorri> spike is a pervert
<interior_gummy> OM NOM NOM
<RobotPinkie> Is he looking at Rarity or the jewels?
<Golden-Poundcake> 0nom
<HeavyMetalPony> Gems aren't vegan?
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> HEY GUISE HOW COME THE DIAMOND DOGS CAN TALK BUT WINONA CAN'T?
<Crainy> they are vegan
<interior_gummy> rule of funny
<Gnorri> companion diamond
<Combustiblelemons> I need rarity in minecraft.
<WinstonChurchill> Brain surgery.
<interior_gummy> dick shovel
<Sumica> same reasion goofy can but pluto cant
<Bjornfot> diamond dogs are maybe actually wolves?
<Crainy> you just need a pony that can do magic
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> magic
<Gnorri> lol, id love to see rarity vs creeper
<Darf14> That tail can do just about everything
<Crainy> WAIT
<Combustiblelemons> Dick shovels ftw.
<PeanutButterWolf> Someone said Wolves?
<Crainy> how can it be
<Golden-Poundcake> 0minecrafter rarity
<mib_vbpnvw> who the fuck is creeper?
<Crainy> that there are these diamond dogs
<Crainy> who can talk
<Crainy> but
<Crainy> Applejack has a dog as a pet?!
<mib_wf8g8f> anyone else hear Zelda music when she gave him that jewel?
<HeavyMetalPony> Crainy: they've been pre-cut by some organism, and therefore contain it's DNA or 'organic magic dust'
<RainbowLoon> now he will never be able to eat that diamond
<interior_gummy> if spike had to choose between gems and rarity...
<Ziltoid> yes crainy
<Combustiblelemons> Spike vs spyro- who wins?
<Gnorri> dogs: banzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai
<Gnorri> !
<Golden-Poundcake> 0there basically gollum, half human half dog i spose
<Golden-Poundcake> 0*half pony
<RobotPinkie> Spike wins, Spyro has no pony friends.
<PeanutButterWolf> Spike because Spyro's new design is horrible.
<HeavyMetalPony> Eew, dirt
<WinstonChurchill> Which spyro?
<BlayzeKohime> If it's the old Spyro, then Spyro. If it's the new one, Spike would stomp him.
<interior_gummy> plot alert
<Golden-Poundcake> 0old spyro
<Darf14> I smell a plot
<Combustiblelemons> spyro has sparx robotpinkie
<WinstonChurchill> Old Spyro is always winrar.
<PeanutButterWolf> VP Spiro Agnew
<Crainy> the ponyyyyyy
<Golden-Poundcake> 0old spyro>spike>new spyro
<RobotPinkie> Not pony enough for me, sorry.
<Sumica> why did't they take them both, one to find one to dig.
<Combustiblelemons> the first spyro was awesome
<Gnorri> spike need to learn karate
<Combustiblelemons> nasty norc was a push over though.
<Crainy> rapists!
<PeanutButterWolf> Wii hunt
<RobotPinkie> Though I do love the early Spyro games
<HeavyMetalPony> Spike needs to earn the power of love
<interior_gummy> who would win: spike or madame le flour
<Barry> Old spyro is so good, I wish I could play it again
<Darf14> ITS A TRAP!
<DragonRage> That dog is a spy!
<Golden-Poundcake> 0i was 4 when that game came out, i never got to nasty norc
<Crainy> SPIKE EARNED THE POWER OF LOVE
<Barry> Spike, with his flame breath
<Gnorri> dat was the raper said!
<PeanutButterWolf> Ripto's death traumatized me
<Combustiblelemons> I wish I could play it again too
<Bjornfot> Spyro was only good in like, the first three games.
<Darf14> Dang, if she only had wings
<mib_vbpnvw> or the power of self respect
<Combustiblelemons> the ending to the first spyro was disappointing
<PeanutButterWolf> also the faun from Spyro 2 made me a furry.
<interior_gummy> ahh dirt
<Combustiblelemons> I was like "after all that, a tv interview? SERIOUSLY..."
<Darf14> Rarity has been kidnapped!
<RobotPinkie> DAMN YOU SALAZAAAAAAR!
<Golden-Poundcake> 0never saw the ending for the first spyro
<Gnorri> ther's no stopping the vortex spike
<crono_flash> Just me or does the big Diamond dogs sound like gutsman?
<Bjornfot> lawl peanutbutterwolf
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> dogs in the pony world are like horses in our world, they are a group of semi-sentient beings but in the pony world some of them have evolved to the point where they attempt to fight against the ponies instead of submitting like winona
<Darf14> err....I mean Ponynap

<Rezo> Spike is a dragon. OF COURSE he is manly
<FreezeFrame> Wheee! hahaha!
<HeavyMetalPony> inb4 Spike is S2's main character
<Combustiblelemons> interspecies what.
<Maxaminus1> God bless pinkie
<PeanutButterWolf> Applejack bites Spike's tail instead of Twilight
<Crainy> pinkie is the best!
<PeanutButterWolf> FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<interior_gummy> season 2 needs a madame le flour episode
<Darf14> Dang these multiple path dungeons

<Ziltoid> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Crainy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Combustiblelemons> watch for lava!
<Rodman> These dogs played too much Minecraft
<RobotPinkie> Nah I've played a lot of Final Fantasy 13, there's only one tunnel, trust me.
<Sumica> SSSSSSSSSSSsssssssss
<Golden-Poundcake> 0she came
<ValtheJean> lol Pinkie
<Combustiblelemons> what crainy said.
<PeanutButterWolf> Both Luna and Pinkamina need to be friends with Rocky in season 2.
<Ghosties> 4There's no such thing as too much Minecraft
<ValtheJean> stupid FF13 wasting my life...
<Gnorri> but.... if celestia is god, who is "gosh"?
<Crainy> thanks, combustible
<PeanutButterWolf> Sharing the same delusion
<interior_gummy> FO-REV-ER
<Rodman> ^^^^^This
<Golden-Poundcake> 0inb4 this is whining
<WinstonChurchill> I hated Hope so much.
<RobotPinkie> Hopefully FF15 will be awesome
<Combustiblelemons> Convenience!
<ValtheJean> meh, I doubt it
<RobotPinkie> ....I can't keep a straight face even while typing that...
<interior_gummy> plot
<FreezeFrame> Trollity
<ValtheJean> they've had 2 failed MMOs, and 12 and 13 were utter shit
<HeavyMetalPony> I watch it for the plot
<interior_gummy> DICK
<Combustiblelemons> FOREVERRRR
<FreezeFrame> or is it Raritroll?
<Rezo> Rarity is best pony
<Gnorri> dat digging
<ValtheJean> as far as I'm concerned, Final Fantasy ended at 10
<desertman2> 12 wasn't that bad
<Darf14> FF13 - walk down a hallway for +20hrs until you get to the real game
<Golden-Poundcake> 0egh...egh..uhhh..
<RobotPinkie> But FF10 was good, Val
<Ghosties> 4I watch it...for the whining
<Crainy> DICK
<Combustiblelemons> Raritroll works
<WinstonChurchill> FF12 was fine. Just less bitchy characters.
<interior_gummy> DICK
<ValtheJean> oh I agree
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> DAT FAIL DIGGING
<ValtheJean> hence why 10 was the end of FF
<ValtheJean> but 12 was shit
<DragonRage> FF12 was the last good FF to me. And even then, that game's battle system gets old fast.
<Maxaminus1> PONI PEDI
<RobotPinkie> Balancing was shit in FF12, though.
<FreezeFrame> She's not actually failing, blocks
<Ghosties> 4Final Fantasy X is the last great Final Fantasy game
<desertman2> You just need to pay attention to the story, since it wasn't easy to follow
<ValtheJean> 12 was just an utter fail of trying to implement an MMO system into a single player game
<crono_flash> Agreeed Ghosties
<RobotPinkie> Loved the gambit thing, very KoTOR of them in general, but it was just not fleshed out.
<Rodman> Rarity would be useful as a Diamond finder, but would suck in Minecraft's most important action: Digging
<ValtheJean> and the gambit system was INCREDIBLY glitchy
<Crainy> for a second there, i thought he was going to say "oh fuck godness"
<Golden-Poundcake> 0inb4thisiswhining
<PeanutButterWolf> The cave is still prettier than Metaluna
<Gnorri> why dog command dog?
<WinstonChurchill> Final Fantasy X-2 was cool.
<interior_gummy> SMEEEEELLL
<ValtheJean> I mean, sure the Materia system was pretty abuseable, but god damn the Gambit system failed
<FreezeFrame> Ah. Mystery solved. It's your breath.
<Ziltoid> ENOUGH|
<desertman2> X-2 had the best battle system
<ValtheJean> X-2...was interesting
<Gnorri> in equestria no one like pants?
<PeanutButterWolf> Guard dogs, now rubble
<ValtheJean> I mean, I appreciate them experimenting with the dressphere system
<FreezeFrame> That's the proof of trolling.
<Sumica> Lira likes pants
<ValtheJean> but it just felt like too much fanservice
<WinstonChurchill> Anyone remember the massage minigame?
<interior_gummy> no, you're a mare
<ValtheJean> oh god
<mib_vbpnvw> i like how the leader of the diamond dogs sounds like snips.
<HeavyMetalPony> Next episode, Rarity finds African blood diamonds
<ValtheJean> the massage
<Golden-Poundcake> 0TTHIIIIS ISS WHIIIINNING
<interior_gummy> inb4 best part
<HeavyMetalPony> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<RobotPinkie> <3
<Golden-Poundcake> 0best part
<Braindrainer> oh shit
<PeanutButterWolf> Blood Diamonds without DiCaprio?
<Darf14> Pro Whiner
<FreezeFrame> I love the hoofstomping.
<Golden-Poundcake> 0but i thought you wanted whining
<CriticKitten> So that's where This Island Earth got its soundtrack
<Maxaminus1> hoofstomp
<DragonRage> Dat death glare.
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> HeavyMetalPony HAS ANYONE MADE BLOOD DIAMOND TRAILER WITH RAIRTY
<Crainy> BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHINING
<RobotPinkie> Rarity is so awesome in this episode.
<crono_flash> anything?
<ValtheJean> lol
<Maxaminus1> I dunno
<ValtheJean> did anyone notice that mule sound?
<interior_gummy> this cave, now rubble
<FreezeFrame> Raritroll is best troll pony
<ValtheJean> they play a mule noise as she mentions complaining
<Darf14> You fool, never say anything to anyone! *shivers*
<interior_gummy> these dogs, now rubble
<Rodman> RARITY used MANIPULATION
<Aeroslash> hi llots!
<ValtheJean> never caught that before
<Crainy> quiet
<Rodman> ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE!
<Gnorri> dog are stupid
<FreezeFrame> Better than Trollestia and Trolluna combined
<Crainy> Celestia will send you to the moon
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> You are all peadges! and such
<PeanutButterWolf> Men?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I mean hi
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> :>
<crono_flash> I have to admit this has become one of my favorite episodes
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> of dogs and men
<PeanutButterWolf> my purple drank
<WinstonChurchill> 4 l
<Golden-Poundcake> 0this is a marmite episode
<RobotPinkie> Dat spank!
<Golden-Poundcake> 0either it makes you lvoe or hatee rarity
<HeavyMetalPony> Why would anybody hate this episode? :(
<Barry> So if Celestia's molesting persona is called Molestia, is Luna's molesting persona, if she has one, called Moluna?
<Darf14> :(
<Gnorri> poor mule
<interior_gummy> inb4 marshmallow jokes
<Golden-Poundcake> 0my fellow brony dislikes this episode
<Ziltoid> MARSHMELLOW
<Rezo> I'd pay to get to spank Rarity <_<
<SirSprinkles> 6MARSHMALLOW EVERYWHERE
<GGgala> mule-racism
<Braindrainer> poor rarity
<Ziltoid> This episode is awesome
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> rarity is racist against mules
<PeanutButterWolf> Mallow from SMRPG kinda sucked
<FreezeFrame> It's all an act.
<Darf14> Rarity at her best
<RobotPinkie> SOYLENT MARSHMALLOWS ARE PONIES
<BlayzeKohime> Remember Rarity wasn't offended by having her butt slapped. Only by being called a mule.
<HeavyMetalPony> That's good and well, but can her whining save Metaluna?
<interior_gummy> i broke the game by using the lazy shell on peach
<Eccocode> Hey LLotS
<interior_gummy> she never dies, and has infinite healing powers
<Barry> Ponies are just marshmallows banished from the marshmallow kingdom
<PeanutButterWolf> inb4 Fuck 'em up
<Ziltoid> AJ is baws
<Rodman> Metal Luna is perpetually screwed anyway given that its population sucks balls
<Rezo> BlayzeKohime: Rarity is a natural sub. FACT.
<Golden-Poundcake> 0getting stuck on pinkie would be ultra hard mode
<Gnorri> that episode are perfect for the rule 34 *TROLLFACE*
<Golden-Poundcake> 0she bounces for a living
<Golden-Poundcake> 0yay whinney
<GGgala> Rezo: But Rarity is a dominatrix!

<HeavyMetalPony> Rarity, I'm in lesbians
<PeanutButterWolf> shoot stars coming out of its ass, and fuck 'em up. Applejack is best pony
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> they can make horse sounds?

<RainbowLoon> Twilight is best nerdy pony
<Barry> Rainbro, I think you'll like what I have in store for Twilight in my story
<Armads_> then the server needs to stop being etc
<Gnorri> i like fluttershy
<Crainy> theres only two kinds of Ponies:
<interior_gummy> Dear Princess Celestia, being a total bitch fucking works. Men are so easily manipulated. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
<RobotPinkie> I wuv all ponies
<FreezeFrame> Rarity is best pony, but other 5 are awesome, too.
<DragonRage> Everypony is best pony.
<PeanutButterWolf> Shores wants half eaten gems
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> ^
<Crainy> Applejack and Pinkie Pie
<HeavyMetalPony> Twilight is awesome, but has no likeable scenes in this episode
<Crainy> and then everyone else
<DragonRage> Some are just more best than others.

<Purple`Prose> Indeed

<ValtheJean> I've been babysitting my niece

<HeavyMetalPony> bye Mare & Crainy
<ValtheJean> see ya heavy metal
<Barry> Applejack is Ms. American Pie?
<PeanutButterWolf> The confederacy fought to END slavery. Applejack is the best pony.
<Darf14> bye ....uhhh...the brony that has the very long name
<RobotPinkie> bai crainy
<ValtheJean> so who wants to play something with ValtheJean?
<Sathi> 7like I said I might take the stream over in a bit.. just need to fix some technical issues
<ValtheJean> if Hipster were here I'd ask him if he got Diablo II working
<RobotPinkie> I want to play some more Splinter Cell Conviction... but I don't own it. :(
<ValtheJean> god I miss that game
<interior_gummy> applejack is a drunk republican with a tattered confederate flag in the back of her pickup truck
<SilverMare> RainBroDash, have you read the Silvermare and MarithTinker story from today?
<ValtheJean> ooo00ooo, what will Sathi be streaming for us? :P
<Sathi> 7you'll see
<RobotPinkie> lol I have Diablo 2 working... but I'm too lazy to play right now
<GGgala> ValtheJean: what do you have in mind?
<ValtheJean> the mods should totally bug Hipster about Diablo II, as I'm too lazy to find him on Ponychan :P
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ9tilv4A1g
<ValtheJean> @GGgala no idea
<interior_gummy> god, my dad is obsessed with diablo 3
<ValtheJean> not sure what everyone has
<Elky> 0so I heard sathi's gonna stream cats
<ValtheJean> though if the stream comes back online, I'll stay most likely
<PeanutButterWolf> Having another Texan in the Whitehouse would save America. Applejack is the best pony.
<ValtheJean> >inb4 giant political shitstorm
<Purple`Prose> PBW: best be trolling
<RobotPinkie> Sometime in future, epic Brony coop. Too bad I don't play WoW anymore, a 25-man brony raid sounds like fun.
<interior_gummy> applejack has more of an oklahoma accent anyway
<ValtheJean> @RobotPinkie had cataclysm not caused me to quit, I'd totally have supported that
<Elky> 0don't remind me of diablo 2; I lost too many hours on that game
<Sathi> 7@ValtheJean PM
<Purple`Prose> I'm Texan, and even I don't want another Texan in the WH
<interior_gummy> i support pinkie for president
<interior_gummy> free cupcakes for everyone
<Purple`Prose> I support Celestia for President-For-Life
<Gnorri> i must go, the internet need me and when the "broadcast is offline" i am sad. bye!
<interior_gummy> dash would be her vp to get the gay rights vote
<Elky> 0AJ + Twilight + Pinkie for president
<Elky> 0bye gnorri
<PeanutButterWolf> The moon is made of Jesus. Applejack is the best pony.
<RobotPinkie> Myeah, not playing since Cataclysm either...
<RobotPinkie> or well, I stopped before WotLK was even finished.
<Purple`Prose> Twilight for President, Pinkie Pie for Secretary of Stat
<Purple`Prose> e
<Darf14> @Elky There can only be one president, they must fight for it.....TO THE DEATH
<RobotPinkie> haven't seen Arthas, don't care.
<ValtheJean> it was a really fun fight
<ValtheJean> the cinematic at the end was lame
<ValtheJean> but the fight mechanics were solid
<FreezeFrame> Rainbow Dash for President
<ValtheJean> *nostalgia sigh* I remember my first LK down...
<Elky> 0well, that's what we determined in the hurt&heal thread waaaay back
<FreezeFrame> Because she's the only one who would pilot a mecha in defense of the US
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I dunno, I'm pretty happy with not playing it anymore
<interior_gummy> so no postshow until 9:30?
<Elky> 0just making sure: 2 hours until robots?
<ValtheJean> @gummy that's a maybe. Sathi may or may not be testing something
<Ghosties> 4I'll catch you guys later. See ya guys
<ValtheJean> have a good one ghosties
<RobotPinkie> later Ghosties
<Elky> 0wait, 3?
<Elky> 0dammit
<Ghosties> 4Thanks, later
<Sathi> 7I will be testing in a bit
<Elky> 0see ya ghosties
<Sathi> 7Bye Ghosties
<Sathi> 7err gone already
<Elky> 0testing CATS
<ValtheJean> if I had L4D2, I'd totally suggest you stream it while we play :P
<Darf14> bye Ghost- too late
<Sathi> 7you should totally get it
<Sathi> 7:)
<ValtheJean> if it goes on sale again, I probably will
<ValtheJean> unfortunately I blew most of my "non-college fund" money on League of Legends >.<
<Sathi> 7err..did you buy champs
<ValtheJean> stupid LoL being my gateway to stop the WoW addiction...
<ValtheJean> skins <.< >.>
<ValtheJean> and champs...
<Sathi> 7errr..
<ValtheJean> oh god I'm pathetic
*Sathi 7nods
<ValtheJean> :(
<ValtheJean> though I also got the additional rune pages
<ValtheJean> that was a really practical buy
<Ziltoid> Y U YOU BUY THINGS THAT YOU COULD GET BY PLAYING THE GAME MORE?
<RobotPinkie> I'd suggest some hardcore SP playing
<Sathi> 7I quit LoL already
<Sumica> oki gonna idle till night of the liveing robots.
<ValtheJean> well, because you can't get skins with IP :P
<ValtheJean> I'm a skin addict
<Ziltoid> I mean champs
<Elky> 0so I heard LoL was similar to DotA
<Elky> 0what would you pay for?
<Sathi> 7it is
<ValtheJean> well the champ purchases were for new releases, like Ori or Jarven
<Ziltoid> also theres exp boosts
<ValtheJean> and it was just cost effective to get the skin pack
<Ziltoid> thats how they get ya
<RobotPinkie> not a fan of microtransactions...
<Sathi> 7micro transactions ftw..
<ValtheJean> on the plus side
<Sathi> 7even aoc got it
<Sathi> 7and they make tons of money on it
<ValtheJean> I spend SIGNIFICANTLY less on LoL than I do on WoW
<RobotPinkie> always ends up costing more
<RobotPinkie> oh it's great for the publisher, no doubt.
<Ziltoid> eeyup
<ValtheJean> I just wish Riot would spend more time on game balance than on shoveling out new champs...
<Sathi> 7miss fortune I loved her :( until she got nerfed to the ground
<Sathi> 7then I quit :D
<ValtheJean> she's still really solid
<ValtheJean> I main her
<ValtheJean> well...I main like half the champions
<ValtheJean> but still
<ValtheJean> she is still a very solid carry
<Ziltoid> When I used to play I used Amumu
<ValtheJean> and ever since the Corki nerf, she's right up there again
<ValtheJean> it's a shame they ruined Noc and Yorick...they were my favorites
<Ziltoid> Ill be back for giant robot time
<RobotPinkie> I like Pong, that's a good competitive game.
<Ziltoid> 9:30?
<Sathi> 7what time is it now?
<Ziltoid> 9:30 est I think
<ValtheJean> 4:38 my time, which means 7:38 EST

<Elky> okay?
<ValtheJean> oh god

<Ray> 02Nini~
<interior_gummy> ^read that one
<Pegacorn> But seriously,i'm sure i can stomach it.
<junh1024-XD> the knights of Ray say nini!
<ValtheJean> I didn't read it (not because of the grimdark) but because I refuse to read fanfic in general
<Kosovo> night ray~
<mib_u23pjf> Oh god that's nasty, why man, why?
<Aeroslash> bye Ray
<Pegacorn> I read fanfics if they spark my interest.
<wolfinponysclothing> same
<Barry> same
<DragonRage> Likewise. Still need to read Past Sins, though. I keep putting it off.
<mib_u23pjf> Well it's not like i needed sleep tonight anyway.
<Barry> But I also write fanfics
<nickstr> and then change their name to unintelligable random sylables
<Pegacorn> I don't care for Past Sins.inb4 shitstorm
<Dermathil> what's yer name, Anon? Got a username you use?
<ValtheJean> it might just be the elitism that comes with the territory (which ironically I try to avoid) but as an english major I can't stomach fanfics
<NovaCoru> hai
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<DragonRage> Partly because I've been writing my own stuff and don't have time, partly because I don't really care about Nyx, but mostly because of Team Fortress 2.
<mib_u23pjf> no, new here
<Dermathil> (oh snap. Don't mention TF2 near Val.)
<Pegacorn> TF2
<Pegacorn> TF2
<ValtheJean> lol
<DragonRage> Welcome to Team Fortress 2.
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<wolfinponysclothing> my comp wont let me play tf2 :(
<Drake> 04'Ello
<ValtheJean> you can talk about TF2 all you want in front of me :P
<DragonRage> I just recently got my Bonk from scout achievements, and I love it.
<Light_Latias> 12ohai
<ValtheJean> just I will voice my disdain for said game :P
<Ray> 02<junh1024-XD> the knights of Ray say nini! <- how do you dare?! D: I'm one of the Knights who says YESZ
<Drake> 04Heya LL
<Ray> 02YESZ
<junh1024-XD> NOZ
<DragonRage> My only complaint is that my team mates always run off whenever they see me distracting an enemy sentry.
<Ray> 02now sleep z-z
<mib_u23pjf> Anyone here a fan of Homestuck?
<NovaCoru> I love homestuck
<Ray> 02Kthxbaaaai~

<wolfinponysclothing> never heard of it
<NovaCoru> kanpyre is best troll
<Pegacorn> Guys,i hope Bjornfot didn't cause too much trouble when i was gone.
<nickstr> speaking of which Monty Python And The Holy Grail is available on DVD in the US again
<DragonRage> I've pretty much avoided most things Homestuck related. Not too interested in it, really.
<mib_u23pjf> novacoru, but surely that honor goes to pantskat?
<junh1024-XD> Monty Python And The Holy Grail BD may also be coming soon yay!!
<nickstr> if not for the first time ever
<interior_gummy> gabe newell is a baus
<nickstr> I don't have a Blu-Ray player

<mib_u23pjf> what's your patron troll?
<NovaCoru> Aradia
<nickstr> I have no Blu-Ray drive either
<nickstr> I have no plans to buy one either
<NovaCoru> Elky: its totally worth it
<junh1024-XD> I do
<nickstr> no movies on the format interest me much
<mib_u23pjf> elky, oh yes it is, but worth it if you can get into the story.
<Elky> which is why I'm not really keen on getting into it
<Elky> hm
<wolfinponysclothing> i like my trols like i like my ogres dead and looted
<junh1024-XD> because i want mah HDz, and i have internet caps,
<HyperMetalLugia> The format doesn't interest me at all
<Elky> not sure if I have the needed free time
<junh1024-XD> rent BD for $1, copy/watch, yeah
<ValtheJean> STUPID COMPUTER! Y U TAKE MY MASS SPOTS???
<mib_u23pjf> elky, the best way to describe it, is that it's kind of like doctor who, mixed with final fantasy, at least that's how i'd sum it up.
<wolfinponysclothing> i dont care for eather of those things
<interior_gummy> spam the chat room (like a baus)
<interior_gummy> clop to fanart (like a baus)
<interior_gummy> make a sandwich (like a baus)

<ValtheJean> I would laugh if dari's script included a permaban
<Elky> I doubt dari would do it
<mib_u23pjf> ELKY, if your going to read it, I should mention that the plot is a little wierd, up until you start chapter 2.
<ValtheJean> you gotta admit it'd be hillarious

<everfreenights> so when are robots?
<wolfinponysclothing> forever!!!1
<ValtheJean> in about an hour, give or take
<JewelsFriend> I'm a little slow on the uptake, could someone explain the whole robot thing to me, please?
<ValtheJean> basically
<ValtheJean> LOTS and LOTS of Anime robot episodes
<JewelsFriend> Cool
<Elky> A robot is a mechanical intelligent agent which can perform tasks on its own, or with guidance. In practice a robot is usually an electro-mechanical machine which is guided by computer and electronic programming. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and come in those two basic types: those which are used for research into human-like systems, such as AS
<interior_gummy> 0hey, how is the new transformers cartoon?
<wolfinponysclothing> ok not to great
<JewelsFriend> ELKY, thanks for that, i needed a good laugh.

<Chimera> 04Good answer :P
<Barry> Guys, Suited for Success was meant as a Take That to Executive Meddling, did you know that?
<junh1024-XD> Animal Planet?
<PolishSoviet> I'm just thinking
<PolishSoviet> and just realized
<PolishSoviet> Aang is a fucking selfish cunt
<ValtheJean> I can see why it would be interpretted as such...but I didn't get the feeling the executive board was THAT meddlesome
<ValtheJean> at least, they were certainly less meddlesome than pretty much ANY other show
<Barry> Sometimes they are
<Barry> I mean with how the others pressured Rarity into making the dresses the way they wanted
<ValtheJean> well Faust commented a lot on how they were very workable
<ValtheJean> oh I see, you mean in general
<Soyuz> Whom got a Deus Ex Machina excuse to not man up, drop some balls and decide to actually save the world from a genocidal-mad man whom was about to slaugter millions
<ValtheJean> as in, not directed towards Hasbro
<Barry> Right
<Soyuz> or rather gain common sense
<ValtheJean> ooookay, gotcha
<Drake> 04Oh, is our time for character-bashing already?
<Elky> heh, it's funny how you capitalize the trope names
<Soyuz> At least I'm the type of person who watches the show and notices the flaws
<Soyuz> and not the guy who goes
<Soyuz> 'FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT WONT DARE WATCH IT IN MY LIFE'
<Barry> First, she created the dresses the way she thought it would be. She then brought in a test audience, and when they were rejected, she sought out their advice to make them better. We know how disastrous that became
<Barry> thought they should be*
<Soyuz> I even went back and watched the MLP series of the 80s when I was watching FiM
<Soyuz> ..Never watch it
<Soyuz> NEVER
<Barry> However, in real life, corporations don't usually get a second chance at marketing after a product bombs
<Soyuz> Though the songs were hit and miss

<Soyuz> I was mostly refering to the combat system
<Sathi> 7why is he a jerk?
<Drake> 04lol
<wolfinponysclothing> he likes to hide and atttack people
<Drake> 04The Skyrim combat syster looks awesome.
<Soyuz> but there is something I wish Oblivion had in there
<Drake> 04system*
<wolfinponysclothing> all the time
<Soyuz> Nine Different Chapels to join
<Sathi> 7ohh
<Soyuz> Since in Daggerfall you could join the Eight Churches/Eight Templars
<SilverSonic> !espeon
<SilverSonic> oh wait
<SilverSonic> XD
<Soyuz> Or one of the Knightly orders (which gave you free logding at a high enough rank)
<wolfinponysclothing> hes a real ankle bitter for sure
<Soyuz> Each Church dedicated to one of the Eigh Divines
<Soyuz> *Eight
<Glacymr> !alerts 54650
<ScriptBot> 54650: No Alerts
<Soyuz> Though you couldn't join the rest after you've joined one
<Soyuz> It isn't Nine as Talos wasn't added until after Daggerfall, in Morrowind
<Soyuz> Though if only you had Morrowind for the PC
<Soyuz> you'd be amazed
<wolfinponysclothing> allso likes to hie in my tub till i go piss then boom surpirse hes stareing at your dick
<wolfinponysclothing> hide*
<Sathi> 7Hmm maybe you should call for the cat whisperer!
<Soyuz> Drake; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2r6hilB6Dlc example of the Morrowind mod community
<wolfinponysclothing> lol no hes just a kitten and thinks its allways playtime

<Chimera> 04...
<Chimera> 04Sky :D
<Chimera> 04also
<Drake> 04lol
<Chimera> 04LLOTS
<Chimera> 04WHAT
<Chimera> 04HI]
<Drake> 04Heya Sky
<Chimera> 04WHAT IS THIS SHHHIIIII
<Skylands> 10hi
<Chimera> 04and hey Bree
<Umbreon> 12hi meow
<Soyuz> ohai
<SilverMare> oh oh oh greatest idea i have had all week
<Barry> back
<Gopher> doop
<SilverMare> name of my daughter shall be Sarah Selene
<SilverMare> and that was when i realized that Sarah means Princess
<wolfinponysclothing> i like it
<SilverMare> and Selene is another name for the moon, as is Luna
<wolfinponysclothing> lol cool
<SilverMare> therefore, Sarah Selene = Princess Luna. a
<SilverMare> i was so happy when i realized it
<Sathi> 7great idea !
<Purple`Prose> 11 Minutes
<Barry> Is that the name Luna takes when she goes undercover in Progress?
<Purple`Prose> Yep
<SilverMare> that is the name, yes
<Barry> Thought I recognised it
<SilverMare> well, Selene is
<Barry> speaking of which, I'm waiting on the next chapter
<Sathi> 7I never knew Sarah means Princess :O
<SilverMare> Selene was a mythological being who was on the moon
<Purple`Prose> Actually, Selene was a Greek moon goddess
<SilverMare> yeah, sarah is Hebrew for Princess
<Barry> I believe Selene is Greek for moon
<Purple`Prose> daughter of Hyperion and Theia
<SilverMare> err, that's what i meant. thanks, forgot it was greek
<Barry> and I thought Artemis was the main Greek moon goddess
<FreezeFrame> Seth thinks that cotton is made from sheep
<Purple`Prose> Artemis shares the moon
<wolfinponysclothing> harvest moon
<Barry> Or is she just associated with the moon?
<Purple`Prose> There's Artemis, Selene and Hecate
<Barry> Percy Jackson and the Olympians never mentioned a Selene
<Barry> I guess she's not that well known
<SilverMare> mfw the only reason I even knew about the Selene = moon thing is because of Princess Luna's original concept name, and the song My Selene
<Barry> It mentioned Artemis and Hecate, but not Selene
<SilverMare> there is an old love story about Selene
<SilverMare> Endymion was in love with Selene
<SilverMare> and i don't remember what else happened
<wolfinponysclothing> ugg gotta love geting on new meds my head hurts and im back and forth to the bathroom
<Barry> nice...
<Barry> at Silver, not you, Wolf
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<wolfinponysclothing> i may have to take a nap later

<wolfinponysclothing> agreed
<crono_flash> What I've seen of Big O I've loved
<ValtheJean> the only big O I've seen is from SRW, needless to say I enjoyed it :P
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas gives Nick a can of Budwieser
<wolfinponysclothing> big o showtime
<ValtheJean> wait...is the stream up?
<Purple`Prose> Big O is what would happen if Batman the Animated Series was a super robot show
<wolfinponysclothing> yes
<drf|laptop> 03EW BEER
*Drake just stares
<ValtheJean> that's...weird
<wolfinponysclothing> big is batman robot
<ValtheJean> it shows as offline for me
<ValtheJean> I BE MISSING TEH ROBAWTS
<Riders> It's Civillian Batman with a Mecha. What's not to love
<wolfinponysclothing> no yes to purple
<wolfinponysclothing> stream not on yet
<ValtheJean> oh
<Purple`Prose> I hope Big O is dubbed
<Drake> 04I should keep writing...
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I should go back to coding, but I'm feeling lazy
<Purple`Prose> the eps we're watching, I mean
<Nick> EW BUDWEISER
<Drake> 04XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Then again I blame the Gym for that
<Purple`Prose> Is it safe to link the opening of Big O?
*Nick takes a bottle of Black sheep instead
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Fine Nick! >:(
<Drake> 04"Do we have to drink Budweiser?" "No. That stuff is carbonated cow urine."
<NewDCD> 9my source is Dual Audio
*Umbreon rawrs at LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<NewDCD> 9but I was thinking of going Japanese with Subs
<Nick> ^^^^^^^^
<NewDCD> 9I'll let you guys decide that
<NewDCD> 9so go ahead and discuss it
<ValtheJean> I like that idea :P
<wolfinponysclothing> idc eather way
*Nick gives LLOTS some whiskeh
<Drake> 04I'm 15 so I wouldn't know what it tastes like XD
<Purple`Prose> Does your source have the opening theme/credits?
<Soital> 12LOL some youtube comments amuse me
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas quite happily drinks the Whiskeh
<Drake> 04LLOTS
<Drake> 04Should I:
<Drake> 04A) continue the summary
<Drake> 04or
<Soital> 12"WHY IN EVERY GAME IS JIRACHI SLEEPING" I think it amused me more than it should but LOL
<Drake> 04B) write the character profiles?
<NewDCD> 9it does
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I choose
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> ...............
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Option
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> B
<Drake> 04Okay
<ValtheJean> I mean, if the English VA's do a good job, then sure. But more often than not they don't
<Purple`Prose> Gundam X, Gravion, Eureka 7, Sub with English Subtitles, Big O English Dub
<ValtheJean> so going with the original VA's is usually a good thing in my book
<Drake> 0410,401 words in the plot summary
<Drake> 04My god.
<Drake> 04inb4 it's over 9000
<Purple`Prose> Big O's english dub is excellent
<Riders> I don't mind but I personally prefer the Dub of Big O. There's something about it that appeals to Western sensibilities more
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> It's OVER 10,000!!!
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas shot
<Drake> 04XD
<Purple`Prose> Gravion's, from what I've heard....isn't
<ValtheJean> well, so long as you can assure the Dub is good I'm fine with it
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> New youtube poop. Go!
<ValtheJean> though in the end it's up to DCD :P
<Ziltoid> eeyup
<Purple`Prose> Just my opinions
<ValtheJean> ohai sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey.
<NewDCD> 9sounds like most people would like the Dub
<NewDCD> 9Dub it is
<Razyn> Dub?

<NewDCD> 9just keep the thread bumped
<Riders> About 15 minutes till SHOW TIME!!!
<Purple`Prose> We're watching everything except Big O and Megas with Japanese Audio and Subs?

<NewDCD> 9http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36564145.html
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Though I'm actually getting to point where I'm going to take my swords in hand and find these rioters myself, I'm getting sick of them -.-
<ValtheJean> much appreciated
<Drake> 04Remember the Law of Conservation of Ninjutsu./

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> lolk
<ValtheJean> oh damn it...my trip isn't stored on this machine

<NewDCD> 9Razyn: because it would help us garner more viewers
<NewDCD> 9that, and the schedule was never a secret LOL
<ValtheJean> also because Megas is epic
<wolfinponysclothing> hell yeh
<Riders> NewDCD = You're stealling my lines on Ponychan
<crono_flash> That and I suggested it

<FreezeFrame> I feel old a lot lately
<FreezeFrame> Being 26

<HyperMetalLugia> Wat

<Bjornfot> rainbrodash, that one pic will do perfectly fine
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.

<Quanyails> 7Your parents bickered and caught you in it?

<RainBroDash> 10but I can't shoop for shit
<drf|laptop> 03well
<NewDCD> 9I actually really like this song
<drf|laptop> 03my mom wanted to know what a certain substance she found hidden in our house was.
<drf|laptop> 03so she asked me
<Bjornfot> you do that RBD, it's kinda pixelly
<drf|laptop> 03and then told me my dad must have been hiding it.
<Obs> It's like the only decent song she's ever sung.
<RainBroDash> 10IKR
<NewDCD> 9and yes, it is called "Do You Remember Love?"
<drf|laptop> 03so my dad got mad at her for telling me
<Obs> LOL
<Ziltoid> lawl dat decapetation
<lgl> Wow, that guy got fucked up
<FreezeFrame> Most of the songs in Macross are pretty awesome.
<Razyn> RainBroDash, it's fine. Really.
<EdwardNewgate> SUDDENLY
<Obs> DECAPITATIOOOOOOOOON
<drf|laptop> 03and of course the two of them are now fighting about it
<HyperMetalLugia> Wat
<RainBroDash> 10T.T
<desertman2> Did I see a head?
<NewDCD> 9BROLIENS
<Bjornfot> Do You Remember PUBERTY LOVE
<lgl> DEM EYES
<HyperMetalLugia> Is it a drug of sorts, if I may ask .v.
<Stargazer> that one way to get ahead
<Roara|Touhou> 6ah
<drf|laptop> 03um
<FreezeFrame> Bjornfot: So corny it's awesome.
<Quanyails> 7How egregious is the argument?
<drf|laptop> 03sigh
<Stargazer> talk about getting your beauty sleep
<EdwardNewgate> SORRY WE JUST FIRED OUR ROCKETS AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE.TRUCE?
<drf|laptop> 03should I just say it :/
<drf|laptop> 03and egwhat?
<Purple`Prose> BEHOLD THE POWER OF WEAPONIZED J-POP
<Sumica> so it's a double double double cross?
<NewDCD> 9OHAI AGAIN MAX
<Purple`Prose> PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE!
<Sumica> so is max the new colgate?
<Quanyails> 7How bad was their argument?
<ValtheJean> Friendship is magic mother fuckers
<Stargazer> ok, what side is max on in this version?
<desertman2> What's stopping him from betraying them again?
<wolfinponysclothing2> hell yeh
<FreezeFrame> So, Max gets with the one Meltrandi there?
<Riders> The only way that I'm going to buy this is if I find out Minmay is the Music Meister's long lost twin
<Obs> I hope this movie adds the one thing it's been missing so far.
<FreezeFrame> Riders: Descendent
<Roara|Touhou> 6you dont have to say it unless you want to, I understand just from what you've said
<NewDCD> 9AWWWW YEAH THIS PART
<lgl> I love how calm this song is, compared to the death going on.
<Obs> I better fucking see Macross punch an enemy ship and fire a billion missiles into it.
<NewDCD> 9HIKARU PULLS A LUKE SKYWALKER.
<Sumica> I love the MMM attack.
<drf|laptop> 03well, it hasn't turned into one YET, it was more the two of them avoiding each other all dayl.
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<EdwardNewgate> So, wait, they're killing the other guys anyway?
<drf|laptop> 03but obviously an argument is bound to happen
<NewDCD> 9DIS SCENE
<Obs> Beamspam McMuppet would be proud.
<NewDCD> 9AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Razyn> I missed most of the movie, so all of this is just pretty explosions for me.
<lgl> They are killing the BAD other guys
<NewDCD> 9BEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE
<ValtheJean> no, they're killing the guys who gave the order to slauther hundreds of thousands of people
<Riders> FreezeFrame = Technically it's 2010, so that wouldn't quite work
<drf|laptop> 03because apparently my mom caught my dad doing the same thing like 10 years ago and she said a huge argument ensued bakc then
<Sumica> heres johny!
<drf|laptop> 03and he obviously didn't stop :/
<FreezeFrame> Ah
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<EdwardNewgate> I watched the movie and it's still just pretty explosions for ME
<FreezeFrame> Forgot the timeframe of Macross
<DAT_PON-3> I DONT GET THIS MOVIE
<Riders> Seizure alert!
<Quanyails> 7Is your father willing to change? I'm guessing not, from that previous instance.
<FreezeFrame> I want giant mecha!
<NewDCD> 9DAT SLOWMO
<Stargazer> head for the power regulator on the north tower
<lgl> PROTOCULTURE
<Purple`Prose> MINMAY CANNON! SHOOOOOOOOOOT!
<Ziltoid> TASTE MY CULTURE ALIEN DICKWADS
<Obs> Oh god his eyes exploded
<NewDCD> 9fuck I love that scene
<lgl> And his head blows up like all heads in jars do
<Sumica> no overkill, just open fire and I need to reload.
<Stargazer> did he died?
<ValtheJean> This just further proves:
<Riders> When did this turn into Heavy Metal?
<drf|laptop> 03I have no idea.
<Obs> He died
<drf|laptop> 03He was pretty irked that I found out.l
<ValtheJean> Veritechs are the best mother fucking robots ever
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<NewDCD> 9Dear Princess Celestia,
<ValtheJean> and the SDF1 is the ONLY capital ship worth a damn
<drf|laptop> 03which quite frankly, I was kinda surprised, I didn't think my dad did anything bad like that
<DAT_PON-3> J POP SAVES THE WORLD
<Sumica> Must have been a load bearing head in a jar.
<NewDCD> 9Today I learned that, should aliens invade us, our best chance against them is to have Sweetie Belle sing.
<Obs> Load-bearing villain destroyed!
<drf|laptop> 03I knew about him drinking like 2-3 beers a night :/
<DAT_PON-3> FROM THE LOOKS OF IT
<NewDCD> 9Your faithful student, New DCD
<Razyn> and that everyone digs giant robots.

<HyperMetalLugia> Sad to hear that your father has been keeping secrets from you :|
<Ziltoid> seriousface
<Sumica> so every one else outside just gave up then?
<Purple`Prose> Someone's going to get some SERIOUS poontang
*NewDCD 9still loves this movie
<Ziltoid> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Dorugamon> augh
<The_Si_BadGui> So Vocaloid is what we need against the Reapers?
<lgl> Is that sound of joy or pain
<Stargazer> yes
<FreezeFrame> Both.
<Razyn> Good question
<DAT_PON-3> I HATE VOLCALOID
<NewDCD> 9but Vocaloid is Deculture
<lgl> ok, cool
<Chimera> 04nya
<NewDCD> 9even though I don't hate Vocaloid

<drf|laptop> 03I don't know what my mom is going to do about the situation... she was joking about locking him out by changing the door locks LOL
<EdwardNewgate> THE END
<FreezeFrame> So who does Hikaru choose in the end?
<ValtheJean> he already chose...
*NewDCD 9REALLY loves this artsyle (Haruhiko Mikimoto's)

<drf|laptop> 03um

<EdwardNewgate> Then Minmay kills the other chick and rapes Hikaru over and over until he admits his love for her

<Stargazer> they decide to share
<Ziltoid> inb4 lesbians

<Purple`Prose> I enjoyed it
<Topaz> 1 2 3 4
<EdwardNewgate> slowly getting louder
<Ziltoid> it was kind of dumb
<ValtheJean> is "Hell yes" an appropriate response?
<lgl> I can count to 4! =D
<Sumica> I liked it
<DAT_PON-3> WHY IS SHE COUNTING?
<interior_gummy> VAN TOO TDEE FO
<desertman2> That's clearly 5 lines, not 6

<Bjornfot> HEY GUYS SHE CAN COUNT TO 4
<Obs> They're coming to take me away ha ha
<Obs> They're coming to take me away ha ha
<NewDCD> 9because of THIS:
<Obs> They're coming to take me away ha ha
<FreezeFrame> She's practicing her music counting

<SirSprinkles> 6There needs to be a kick all option...
<crono_flash> i like it NewDCD
<lgl> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED
<DragonRage> If i count loud enough, will it make the aliens go away?
<lgl> BUT I DON'T GIVE A FUCL
<interior_gummy> y u no giant robots
<Quanyails> 7Well, glad you're still relatively secure in your household.
<SirSprinkles> 6Just so I can pop out of lurk and kick everypony.
<lgl> *FUCK
<Sumica> she had 4 arms!
<DAT_PON-3> I DID NOT GET A SINGLE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
<Purple`Prose> Annnnd MUSIC
<DAT_PON-3> BUT LOVED IT
<ValtheJean> so DCD, will you stream the Macross TV show at some point?
<Ziltoid> LOL ALIEN DRUMMER
<desertman2> Macross was a giant robot
<ValtheJean> because that shit was great
<NewDCD> 9oh yeah this scene si from the OVA
<Stargazer> dat mulet
<EdwardNewgate> Sprinkles you TYRANT
<YusukeKomiya> end war with a song
<Purple`Prose> GIANT ALIEN DRUMMERS
<Drake> 04o-o
<The_Si_BadGui> I wish I was here for the start. Twas' a fun watch.
<drf|laptop> 03you aren't?
<Riders> Not fully swaying me over to Macross, but easilly the best I've seen of the franchise so far
<NewDCD> 9in which Hikaru becomes an SDF Captain for the MEGAROAD-1
<NewDCD> 9and then their ship dissapeared in space
<Sumica> zentradi always on drums
<interior_gummy> everypony likes getting kicked
<NewDCD> 9I might stream Macross Plus and later maybe Frontier
<YusukeKomiya> we should watch Intersetller 5555
<NewDCD> 9not sure if should Zero
<Sumica> why not?
<interior_gummy> go ahead you mods, kick me
<DAT_PON-3> YES
<Dorugamon> one of my ZNC servers went down
<Darken_Skye> I love the battle scenes from Zero
<Stargazer> zentradi on drums. dat bass
<interior_gummy> BUT YOU WILL NEVER STOP THIS ALLIGATOR
<NewDCD> 9brb going to get a glass of water
<Quanyails> 7Really, my parents don't like each other at all now; the only reason they're together is because of taking care of the house and kids and financially.
<Purple`Prose> No Macross 7?
<Dorugamon> apparently someone or something killed the process
*ValtheJean wants me some of 'dat Russian captain again
<DAT_PON-3> INTERSTELLA 5555 WOULD BE AWESOME
<Purple`Prose> Macross 7 is utterly gonzo
<YusukeKomiya> its like Across the Universe but cooler
<interior_gummy> best credits ever
<Sumica> I never got 7 at all
<drf|laptop> 03do you have siblings?
<interior_gummy> good thing i can read german
<Obs> I tried to watch 7.
<Bjornfot> TTGL beats the manure out of this and everything else
<Darken_Skye> Macross 7 just wasn't that good
<Obs> But fuck Basara, seriously.
<Purple`Prose> Where musicians that pilot jets with electric guitars fight space vampires
<Stargazer> when i was a kid this was like the greatest thing ever. /sigh
<YusukeKomiya> TTGL gets you high on life
<Quanyails> 7That's what my statement would imply.
<drf|laptop> 03why do you have to be so secretive LOL
<Roara|Touhou> 6she wasnt LOL
<Obs> FLY INTO SPACE AND SING AND PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHT
<Purple`Prose> TTGL is good, but not the be-all-end-all
<Chimera> 04hey Roara~
<drf|laptop> 03well "yes" is a lot easier to type than what she said
<Bjornfot> yes PP
<NewDCD> 9kay back
<YusukeKomiya> mecha wise it does it 4 me
<NewDCD> 9skip credits?
<Sumica> WB
<Stargazer> we watched this movie on the trip over on the titanic.
<NewDCD> 9also what Purple said
<Bjornfot> no dcd
<Galthux> 0Gurren Lagann is easily my favorite Mecha anime
<FreezeFrame> No credit-skipping
<Quanyails> 7Yes, but you don't know how many or who. :P
<Bjornfot> real men watch teh credits
<Obs> TTGL is seriously fun, but yeah, other stuff is great too.
<ValtheJean> DCD, you do realize now that if you stream SRW again I'm going to force you to bring out more Veritechs :P
<NewDCD> 9Gurren Lagann was a GREAT tribute, but it's not the greatest thing ever
<interior_gummy> my favorite movie as a kid was fox and the hound, i think
<HyperMetalLugia> I bet two
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<FreezeFrame> TTGL is awesome, but you don't always want PURE HOT-BLOODEDNESS
<drf|laptop> 03again, why be so secretive? :P
<DAT_PON-3> FULL METAL PANIC?
<FreezeFrame> Don't remind me of that movie, gummy
<NewDCD> 9Val: if that's the case I should start streaming Alpha Gaiden instead
<Stargazer> favorite movie as a kid, hmm... dark crystal maybe.
<NewDCD> 9because in Z all of the Valks have the same attacks
<Bjornfot> not the greatest thing ever, but way better than any other mecha anime
<Obs> I wasn't that big on robot anime until I watched TTGL
<FreezeFrame> That poor fox :(
<ValtheJean> dude, I would seriously show you some serious man love
<Purple`Prose> I disagree
<Obs> So it did that for me at the least.
<Sumica> How about gunbuster 2 if you want random.
<ValtheJean> because SDF1 = greatest capital ship ever
<Quanyails> 7It's the internet. :3
<Darken_Skye> I have a Wave Veritech model that I should work on while I watch this
<lgl> So everyone, answer me this
<lgl> what is love?
<Purple`Prose> Baby don't hurt me
<FreezeFrame> Baby don't hurt me
<Riders> I'm new school all the way and I wouldn't put Gurren Lagann in my top 10 of any given anime
