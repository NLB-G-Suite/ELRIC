<pony_1167> EVERYPONY!!! CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO PREVIEW OF MLP SEASON 3 FROM SDCC :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=TVxr4l5B930
*Eulshy Pokes messeger below me
<Alpha-Omega> YES TUBEMATE
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> -_(\
<JESmith71> -_-
<sergio_scriptor> so much youtube links today :|
<Very_Silly_Filly> pony_1167: You mean the video we saw around half an hour ago?
<Shamroc> wah wah wananana
<Eulshy> /)-(\
<JESmith71> I guess he wasn't here when you told me not to talk about it
<Kandarihu> pony_1167, no video links during stream.
<kalookapoo> who is the best pony?
<AttacktheAndalite> Wait, did the kid shoot himself or....cause I heard a gunshot
<Dovah> Good to know now should i go play Dark Souls or no?
<Unnr> Dun, Dun, Dunnnnnn
<otakon> Unnr: agreed I'd say but I liked the Capital Wasteland setting better
<Very_Silly_Filly> AttacktheAndalite: Sorry
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> now you could sense that kick a mile away
<kalookapoo> Who is the best pony?
<Very_Silly_Filly> kalookapoo: Me of course
<Meanwhile> Da Stargate.
<Unnr> otakon: agreed, but NV's overall plot was more fallout feeling. 3 suffered horribly from lack of faction recognition.
<kalookapoo> . . . damn you
<kalookapoo> your right
<otakon> Unnr: yeah it did
<otakon> Wait...so Crystal Jack is trying to bring Charlie back...
<Lil_B> I was shoecked, today!
<Eulshy> More like the appraiser
<JESmith71> Mods, maybe you ought to put a warning on the front page saying "With Season 3 info now being leaked, remember our no spoilers rule" or something like that
<sergio_scriptor> Dovah: i like more new vegas beacuse it feels more like an nuclear western and more of an open world then fallout 3
<AttacktheAndalite> Did Charlie shoot himself or was it by accient
<MarDoWell> why is it whenever i get on youtube i allways end on my little pony fim :p
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Shot himself by accident.
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: Oh
<OohShiny> because mlp fim links to everything
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> JESmith71: wouldn't work most people find the theaters first
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> its called pixels O' Neal
<Very_Silly_Filly> What, the. FUCK. Oh come on! Audio driver, fixed. Sound = still NOT working
<MarDoWell> thats true the duck song has mlp fim written all over it :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> MarDoWell: Even though it was written around 4 years befire
<Unnr> otakon: nothing was more annoying than wandering around early game in the winterized armour from Operation: Anchorage and having the Brotherhood of Steel people you met later in the game looking at you as if you were neoluddite scum.
<JESmith71> Which I guess explains why newcomers come in here posting video links
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yeah, remember that with Season 3 approaching, any confirmed/unconfirmed rumors about the new Season need to be kept private and out of the chat. We enforce a No Spoiler policy here :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yep, now you tell us
<MarDoWell> i know it was a portal into the furture
<Very_Silly_Filly> Gg brah
<Kandarihu> SuperBrony64, gotcha
<otakon> Unnr: yeah true, but the BoS is worse in New Vegas
<Lil_B> well... hello there...
<Unnr> the BoS is closer to Fallout 1+2 style BoS
<sergio_scriptor> hi Lil_B
<Unnr> in NV
*Panda salutes to SuperBrony64
<JESmith71> I wonder how many times you'll have to repeat that in-between now and when Season 3 airs

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek is streaming HL2?
<MahBoi777> lol
<sergio_scriptor> 2
<Alchemist> when half-life 1 came out I was pretty much obsessed with it.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: you'll hate the last levels XD
<Soul> did you know the zombies in hl2 are saying backwards "oh god, HELP ME!!!!" or "HELP!!!"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<sergio_scriptor> Alchemist: :P
<Alchemist> Kinda scary when I look back at it.
<Soul> in agony
<MarDoWell> leeeeeeeroy jeeeeeenkiiiiinnnsssss
<OohShiny> I don't play HL I play Halo
<DJPON3> Soul Yeah, its awesomeness
<AttacktheAndalite> Hey Wrek, were you the one that streamed HL2 around last November-ish, near Thanksgiving?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i dont remember this part of the level
<OohShiny> because halo is awesome too
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Soul: they also sound like theyre yelling "yabba my icing"
<sergio_scriptor> OohShiny: :| prepare for the hate spam
<Agrold> sergio_scriptor: Oh don't remind me of that:P I hope they will one day make it, but think it's starting to get a bit late for that soon. All the original actors are getting older. At least RDA
<Soul> lol
<alexxm> oh half life
<OohShiny> lol
<SirGanjalf> HL2? Sweet
<Soul> and other zombies are saying in deep pitch the last moments of their lives
<sergio_scriptor> Agrold: yes,and that is sad :'( but i realy hope they realese something new in a few years,altought it highly unlikely (bad spelling sorry)
<Kammerjunk> Hm. So I just found out that my dad doesn't like Gene Wilder.
<OohShiny> half life reminds me of doom
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> how?
<Soul> i cant remember exactly what they say though
<Kammerjunk> And I am disappoint.
<alexxm> Kammerjunk how come
<Bronysith> OohShiny: considering half life was inspired by doom. yea
<Shizuka> 13wrek ist doing a hl2 playthrough now?
<Alchemist> OohShiny: in what ways?
<Lil_B> I like the Flashlight in HL... I always turn it off in L4D because I somehow can see less with in there
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Dunno. He just doesn't think he's a good actor.
<OohShiny> killing monsters
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> aw that headcrab just wanted a hug
<sergio_scriptor> who ine here loves G-Man too ?
<alexxm> Kammerjunk i thought he was good in blazing saddles
<DJPON3> how do you get your ponys to stay still? :O mine bug me whe i play games.
<MarDoWell> my faverit game is wait for it........ EVERTHING!!!!
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Yeah, that was a pretty good film.
<Lil_B> Bronysith well Doom was like the example for Valve on how NOT to make it :/ they wanted to make it completly different
<Alchemist> sergio_scriptor: love how the VA made his voice creepy.
<Soul> doesnt everyone need a good hug from time to time? : )
<Very_Silly_Filly> My favourite game is HL3
<SirGanjalf> Soul: If only. There are theories that headcrabs are only parasiting on humans who are still kinda self-aware.__.
<Agrold> sergio_scriptor: same here, as long as they don't make a new SG:U :P
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Soul: definitely :)
<Kammerjunk> According to statistics, my favorite game is Team Fortress 2.
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly every game that involves Valve and the Number 3 is good
*Eulshy Pokes messeger below me
<Kammerjunk> >VALVe
<Kammerjunk> >3
<Soul> exactly why they scream help backwards
<MarDoWell> tf2 is kinda wierd but not a bad game :p
<Dark92Enigma> OK, everypony, gotta go.......see you all for MOVIE NIGHT! (And an incoming Tenacious D reference)
<Kammerjunk> Ha.
<MahBoi777> bye Dark92Enigma!
<AttacktheAndalite> NIght, Dark92Enigma
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> my fav game is probably star wars the jedi academy
<Alchemist> mine is BF2. I think I hit 1000 hours in that... Wow, that sounds really sad :D

<Soul> bye

<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: You can't use "Valve" and "3" in one sentence, silly filly
<sergio_scriptor> Agrold: god help us,but you know there exists a show that is worst then sg:u ,it's so bad that even the fans dont usualy talk about it,It's called" stargate:affinity" search for it,you will not belive what is about and what kind of show it is...It's baaaaaaad :|

<Soul> valve made a pinkie promise to never make a third game in any of their series
<MarDoWell> who els is listening to music wile waiting

<Doobinz> Thank you
<Meanwhile> Dat loading.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> ...
<Kandarihu> Soul, I hear that Gabe promised to release a game with the number 3 in it by year's end.

<SirGanjalf> DJPON3: My brother played HL2 before HL, but he don't give much shit about plot anyway.

<DJPON3> Bringing home the southern birds, A Pegasus job begins And clearing all the gloomy skys, to let the sunshine in.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Starting a rumor is fun
<MegaMoonShine> We move the clouds and we melt the white snow
<sergio_scriptor> derpy_pony: actualy they are not humans,they are part combine part human
<DJPON3> :D
<OohShiny> Celestia Will die in Season 3!

<MarDoWell> THE FUN HAS BEN DOUBLED AND IS NOW 20% COOLER LET THE PARTYS BEGIN
<OohShiny> let's spread the rumor
*RAWRity starts a rumor that Meanwhile voiced Trixie's love interest for S3.
<Cypresswolf> There will be ponies in season 3!
<Kammerjunk> omg no wai
*DJPON3 forever tears
<derpy_pony> that's what they told you in the mission briefing ^^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Twilight Dies
<MarDoWell> *GASP*
<AttacktheAndalite> RAWRity: Oh god....
*Meanwhile starts a rumour that chat has received a recent influx of dumbass.
<SirGanjalf> Ooh Shiny: That's nothing. I know from certain source that SPIKE. WILL. SING.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ever since I joined this site, I've rarely been on EQD
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: I apparently still have that picture of him admitting his love.
<Cypresswolf> Spoiler! The ponies talk :O
<sergio_scriptor> i want a derpy hooves episode for season 3.A FULL derpy hooves centered episode
<Meanwhile> It's funny because it's not even a rumour. ¬_¬
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: as do I.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: No. It's a fact.
<derpy_pony> ponies? again?
<MarDoWell> meanwile :/ wut?
<GilDash|Dinner> Meanwhile: Hey, is it true you voiced Trixie's love interest in a season 3 ep?
<RAWRity> I'm thinking of blowing it up and setting as my desktop background
<Meanwhile> GilDash|Dinner: Nein.
<GilDash|Dinner> Meanwhile: Yes?! I'll tell everypony I know! :O
<OohShiny> there will be shipping in S3
<SirGanjalf> ded
<RAWRity> GilDash|Dinner: of course he'll deny it. non-disclosure agreement and all that.
<Marx> Oops.
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<OohShiny> not lesbian though
<sergio_scriptor> OohShiny: fluttermac shiping ? :O
<SirGanjalf> ^aww
<OohShiny> nah
<GilDash|Dinner> RAWRity: That's okay. We'll confine it to BS for now. :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> If not lesbian, then ...AGH
<Cypresswolf> Spoiler! I like saying the word Spoiler
<Kammerjunk> Twishy is second best ship.
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: That'll never happen. Ever.
<OohShiny> cherrimac shipping
<derpy_pony> protip: don't die!
<lemur> who's playing?
<Kammerjunk> Twixie is best ship, though.
<LightningDashFast> WOW!!!! the animations was GOOD!!!
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: oh we will see :$
<RAWRity> FluttershyxChangeling in the form of Big Mac?
<DJPON3> Hasbro said Doctor whooves name is doctor hooves.... Legit. also, they basicly (lolbadspelling) said, without meaning to, 'LOL.Derpyhoovesandwut?doctorhooves!samelastnamelolol'
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: No, we won't.
<alexxm> well this fights going well
<OohShiny> there can't be lesbian shippin in a little girl aimed for show
<LightningDashFast> im looking forward to season 3
<Cypresswolf> how much longer to season 3 - 2 months?
<Whiskra> again, what difficulty is this game on?
<Meanwhile> When there can society will have progressed.
<MarDoWell> i got rainbowdash, pinky pie, rarity, applejack, twilight sparkle, fluttershy as my desktop every 30 sec they switch between each other evertime i look at my desktop there diffrent ponys
<RAWRity> OohShiny: more like the network would never take that risk.
<SirGanjalf> Cypresswolf: I think it'll be aired in August
<ACS13123> ITS A TRAP!
<derpy_pony> hooves is a common last pony name
<EspyLacopa> Windswept mane twilight?
<MegaMoonShine> Y'know, I think I will go watch the season 3 thing now
<MegaMoonShine> Sec guys
<RAWRity> Hell, "Glee", a show supposedly aimed at adults, had a huge controversy when 2 men kissed for half a second on their show.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Hah. Acceptance of difference. Surely you jest.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Holy crap, just realised I've been around on BS for a year now
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Ikr.
<OohShiny> it's gay shipping
<LightningDashFast> they probably got a budget increase thats for sure
<OohShiny> lol
<DJPON3> Turn sound all the way up on desktop Ponys and add mane six. lols are to be expected
<Cypresswolf> August - sooner than I expected - need to hurry up with more of those bingo choices - can't think up anymore
<RAWRity> LightningDashFast: doubtful.
<derpy_pony> in torchwood they kissed a minute or so
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek ded.
<Kammerjunk> This place looks frustrating.
<Sumica> 00,10Wrek, crouch down and throw a nade

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dance in the bullets!
<sergio_scriptor> derpy_pony: but that is torchwood :P
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: Yeah, but Jack Harkness being gay is canon.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek needs to get on top of the turrets
<alexxm> i figured season 3 would air septemberish
<Shamroc> Rain...wut
<LightningDashFast> but the animation was more fluid than last season
<SirGanjalf> Antlions would be useful
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<Whiskra> you practically have to roll your grenades with perfect accurracy
<RAWRity> Hasbro's gonna be keeping the show as cheap as possible so that they can maximize profits.
<Shamroc> fai

<Soul> i hate soccermoms so much
<mitamaking> So? Portal 2?
<TheShadowQuill> MangoBobeh: What Octavia and Rarity thing?
<AttackttheMaid> SpadeMagnes[R]: Then why wasn't anyone raging and sending all their rage towards the soccer moms then? Weren't they the main ones complaining?
<Kiwijunk> sergio_scriptor: I know it was supposed to be an Applejack. But it ended up being a Derpy episode.
<GarettBrony> Soul what about Lacross Moms?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> sergio_scriptor: AGAIN the over sensitive faggots wouldent allow it
<MegaMoonShine> maidlicious: I see what you did there :|

<turtlegod98> so many letters!
<AlienWarhead> Tango Sucka
<Operatorpony> err L
<richfiles> But my point, is it would be moded (no span, no trolls, but fair didcussion for all things pony. We actually DON'T have that. Much pony content is restricted, and we DON'T have a safe place to discuss it without being subject to other parasprites or haters.
<Wrek> 05richfiles: bronystate has several rooms. but you only join the main one by default
<MegaMoonShine> StuffCrusader: Lima
<IshMangoPony> it looks more like a sci-fi b movie
<Kandarihu> Well, the zero tolerance policy on S3 spoilers is going to turn Bronystate into a sanctuary from all that. I honestly hope it does.
<magmablock> S H R C B M U E V S E G
<ShadowQuill> I just died in Portal 2. When Wheatley said there was a pony farm, I finally caved.

<Conyst> shoot all the buttons
<PipisbestPuppy> That's alot of fish
<Calcos323> War changes when it never changes
<OohShiny> a movie based on the cold war?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh well. We'll start a nuclear war tomorrow.
<Phase4> 00,02so glad i'm not that guy
<Meanwhile> John Wood?
<DocSane> Strangely happy music
<sergio_scriptor> that is the SGC :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Did anyone kill a red spy on the way here?
<Marx> I actually watched this movie a long time ago in school.
<owlicious> no
*LadyCanary giggles
<Conyst> they are going to the stargate

<Meanwhile> Phase4 is best John Wood.
<fluttercry> 05,15You dare disagree with Ron Perlman!
<AttacktheAndalite> SpadeMagnes[R]: Not that I know of, no
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Then we still have a problem
<Fou_Lou> someone doing trivia today?
<WindWhistler> This movie was on TV just a few days ago.
<Darf14> nope
<pony_300> This is some upbeat music for coming off of seeing a man threatened at gunpoint to launch a nuke
<Ouroboros> What was the name of the russian who was actually faced with that?
<AlienWarhead> And a knife
<StinkomanFan> Oh come on. It's a GAMING movie!
<Phase4> 00,02so i've never seen this before
<cher3ry> I got two red spies. They were disguised as babies. Damn red spies.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dammit.
<Bronysith> hello my fellow regulars
<Sumica> 00,10awwwwww I missed ladyC
<Kurra> Ron Perlman's a PANSY. Yeah I said it!
<Baxter> lol
<MrBen> Fluttercry: YOU DARE TO DISAGREE WITH ME?! DON'T YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
<StinkomanFan> How could it NOT be interesting?
<BowDownToTheSocks> pony_300: I know right
<WalkerPony89> 'Ello Bronysith
<IshMangoPony> which hasn't done anything interesting yet
*Bjornfot molests Bronysith
<Bronysith> Bjornfot: nope
<Kurra> just kidding, he's likely not a pansy
<MrBen> (mashes the button, blows up 1/4th of the planet)
<Vagineer> dat music
<Meanwhile> One does not simply say no to Bjornfot.
<Kandarihu> The nuke requires that two people turn the key in unison to launch. The one guy who was going to turn the key holding the guy who wasn't at gunpoint kind of undermines that.
<WalkerPony89> Music so far is terrible
<RosePetal> Weird police car.
<Sumica> 00,10such peppy music
<IshMangoPony> Bjornfot try molesting Stinko
<MegaMoonShine> Say, what's this button do?
*Bronysith molests Meanwhile

<Baxter> This is such an exciting action scene
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ALL the TF2 references
<Conyst> no not that button
<Sneaks> lets get this stuff started!
*Bronysith crash lands into Meanwhile
<Ouroboros> Ah, Stanislav Petrov

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> generic government names
<OohShiny> how much time is the movie?
<Vagineer> there was a red spy in the base

<SpadeMagnes[R]> The stuff revealed for S3 were asked at the convention right?
<RosePetal> Trapped FOREVER!
<AlienWarhead> Naz you actually missed 6 or 7 minutes because we started late
<MrAwesome> thats a big door 0_0

<BowDownToTheSocks> Help me red spy, you are my last hope
