<Celes_Chere> Nittany_Discord: So you are saying CoD is not the best put it is pleasing to the palettes of the majority?
<junh1024-XD> http://www.localist.co.nz/l/novus-central-glass
<flutterchu> Bronysith: Cod is never a good story people are just to busy hearing 7 year old's raging

<Meanwhile> Cloud: Great. I'll see if I can find some care to give you.
*sagas[A] holds Alister[S] hand :)
<Bronysith> flutterchu: i know. but the millions of sheep whom actually buy it, for 60$ a pop, i guess it is good for the economy. not for actual gameplay
<diddutz1> Nittany_Discord: The SP i enjoyed, but MP is rather annoying
<HyperMetalLugia> misread as
<HyperMetalLugia> Localhost.
<MahBoi777> Cloud: k..
<Ponies47> GIMMIE TACOS! :[
*Alister[S] holds sagas[A] back firmly

<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<hen3ry> just sayin
<Celes_Chere> Nittany_Discord: This is something I can stand by, then. Better than hating something for an arbitrary reason such as mercury poisoning.
<HyperMetalLugia> So Jun
<flutterchu> Bronysith: that's why i don't want a first perso shotter or xbox live
<SolairePony89> Dying in 2 shots = NOT fun

<Jake5T_> Battlefield 3 anyone?
<Vordox> LOL EXPlanation
<Bronysith> Jake5T_: nope
<MahBoi777> I'm fine with BF, and I love Halo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have BF3, but no real desire to play it.
<sagas[A]> flutterchu: just try not to fall into pigeon holes. Be yourself
<Evil_Spike> So now because exams are over, I have nothing to do
<Meanwhile> I've ignored BF, and I hate Halo.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: tf2?

<Bronysith> Meanwhile: l4d2, css?
<Evil_Spike> Should be playing more TF2
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: dont its crap :P
<Meanwhile> Fine with all those. Cept css.
<flutterchu> sagas[A]: to be myself is to follow my dreams and my dream is to kiss fluttershy and be an emo brony
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i know what you mean. the AWP sniper makes the game near unplayable
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA and DICE's decisions with the game make me want to play it less.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: AND its EA
<DocSane> flutterchu: I think you need a new dream, because that one won't lead you anywhere.
<sagas[A]> flutterchu: alright then do that
<JRP2234> lol the garrys mod loading screen said delaying episode 3

<dashierulez> nooooooooooooooooo
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: some fanboy will buy that for a shitzillion dollars later on
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: plus its shit compared to Bad Company 2, that game is awsome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hated BC2.
<dashierulez> oh he ok
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Why?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Waste of money.
<DocSane> flutterchu: Forgive me, but you sound really distressed.
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<Ponies47> BRB
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I rarely had fun playing BC2.
<Reikim> So...any more ponies wanting to play TF2? Yes? No?
<MahBoi777> BC2 was okay imo

<otakon> Meanwhile: same here
<CrimsonPhoenix> MahBoi777, that ain't camping
<Bronysith> if you think about it
<RAWRity> Psh, wusses.
<MahBoi777> nope
<DocSane> I really enjoyed my summer camp when I was a kid.
<Bronysith> you are always camping
<Lone_Lycan> so?
<Lone_Lycan> i chat till 3 or 4 am sometimes
<MahBoi777> CrimsonPhoenix: but it was kewl
<RAWRity> My mom and I wnt camping for a week with nothing but 2 sleeping bags and a tarp.
<Yahooz> Camping is bawss
<DocSane> Not quite Meatballs, but kind of close in a few ways.
<CrimsonPhoenix> MahBoi777, no it ain't
<CrimsonPhoenix> it defeats anything that makes camping fun
*SaxyPretender has never been camping
<otakon> RAWRity: and then you drank your own piss
<Meanwhile> Saxy: We must go camping.
<RAWRity> She taught me how to hunt using sharpened sticks and how to make rabbit traps.
<MahBoi777> CrimsonPhoenix: I know it's not camping
<Bronysith> ogod
<Bronysith> NOT THE BEES
<SaxyPretender> 0,14But you hate camping, Meanwhile!
<Yahooz> RAWRity: try a Biking/ camping trip covering over 500 miles on the New England Coast :3
<Yahooz> das me
<CrimsonPhoenix> then don't call it camping
<Barbetos> Whoa whoa. What is going on in here? Drinking piss? Did I just walk into a very devolved rp session?
<RAWRity> Yahooz: try fighting a wolf at age 8.
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: Yeah, but you've never been. We can go fight a bear or something.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fight a bear? WORKS FOR ME
<Yahooz> RAWRity: try fighting a bear at age 10 XD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, RAWRity, I will be forever jealous if you did that
<MahBoi777> CrimsonPhoenix: that;s why I said "forget the camping"
<Meanwhile> Bust a....bear. Huh.
<otakon> Meanwhile: you'll fight it....BEAR HANDED!
<Ponies47> (sigh) I'll be back in a few. I gotta go find my dog :|
<Yahooz> SaxyPretender:
<Yahooz> he would... Bust-a-wolf
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: I still have a bite scar on my left ankle.
<otakon> Ponies47: good luck
<Meanwhile> otakon: boooo
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=luna&offset=120#/d3jdc4m
<otakon> Meanwhile: get off the stage?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Bronysith> that pic is epic win
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's awesome then, risky but awsome
<otakon> poor Celestia
<otakon> poor poor Celestia
<otakon> WHY DOES NO ONE LOVE HER?
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: wasn't like I planned it.
<Bronysith> i wouldve hugged her otakon
<otakon> yeah me too actually
<flutterchu> otakon: i really like her mane
<otakon> flutterchu: who doesn't?
<DocSane> Celestia seems too perfect to love.
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=luna&offset=168#/d4ytt5n
<Yahooz> check out da mane on dat mare
<otakon> DocSane: hmmmm still not a good enough reason
<DocSane> We love the characters who seem flawed and relatable
<SolairePony89> flutterchu: I perfer Luna's mane
<Yahooz> suddenly pouring rain...
<flutterchu> SolairePony89: i prefere both
<DocSane> Celestia is a sort of distant, fairy tale perfect authority figure.
<Bronysith> i love Twilights, lunas, celestias, rainbow dashes, manes the best really
<Ponies47> Well I found my dog. He sounded like he was barking outside but no he was inside in the living room sleeping. :$ Now I feal dumb :s
<MahBoi777> Yahooz: lucky
<SolairePony89> DocSane: Who knows? Maybe in season 3 we'll get some more deatils about her character
<DocSane> Luna is more popular because we're intimately familiar with her flaws
<Yahooz> MahBoi777: ikr. perfect to fall asleep to :3
<otakon> not really
<Lone_Lycan> your dog was inside.. barking while sleeping?
<otakon> DocSane: fanon, lots and lots of fanon
<MahBoi777> Yahooz: definitely lol
<RAWRity> >Flawed but relateabe
<Bronysith> oh dear
<DocSane> Not just fanon.
<otakon> DocSane: that and she's more of a victim figure I think
<Bronysith> i didnt mean to starta flame war (first time in ever)
<RAWRity> You do realize that, when most of the Luna stuff was made, she literally had 3 lines and 1 minutes of screentime
<Ponies47> Lone_Lycan: It sounded liek he was barking. Maybe somebody else brought him in and I didn't notice :$
<otakon> Bronysith: your fine
<flutterchu> who wants to see fluttershy's mom
<Ponies47> *like
<Bronysith> otakon: i fucked up
<otakon> RAWRity: like I said, fanon
<Bronysith> i posted the pic
<RAWRity> there was no time at ALL to get a guage on her actual character.
<DocSane> We know that Luna gave into jealousy and hatred and then she came back as an insecure figure who was literally screaming at people to love her.
<Bronysith> and now theres a flame war
<otakon> Bronysith: relax there is no flame war
<Ponies47> Wait what's going on? :s
<otakon> DocSane: actually.....that is spot on if you went from S1 to Luna Eclipsed
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=luna&offset=192#/d4f4uk8

<RAWRity> DocSane: that's what we know now. During S1, all people knew was that she got angry, became NMM, was imprisoned, then came back and said she was sorry.
<Bronysith> Ponies47: apparently luna vs celestia
<Ponies47> SolairePony89: I see.
<otakon> it's not
<otakon> no debate

<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> Jun
<HyperMetalLugia> darn you
<HyperMetalLugia> I went through
<DocSane> Before Luna Eclipsed, fandom had Luna as Woona, the poor little baby princess who was sat in a cardboard box and abandoned.
<HyperMetalLugia> 2 freezes
<HyperMetalLugia> and 1 BSOD
<otakon> RAWRity: exactly, thus fanon filling in the spots
<junh1024-XD> '-'
<flutterchu> anyone want to see fluttershy's mom http://yamino.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-s-Mom-210478565
<otakon> but still, I like what they did with Luna
<HyperMetalLugia> Just from plugging in the speaker to the black jack .v.
<HyperMetalLugia> Updating the creative drivers though
<RAWRity> otakon: if by "filling in the spots" you mean "Making literally everything up and calling it canon.
<RAWRity> "
<otakon> RAWRity: and thus fanon
<otakon> but still I like all of them
<Yahooz> canon ≠ fanon
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 blackjack (card game)
<otakon> well, except Diamond Tiara since she's a spoiled little brat
<Yahooz> if it was i wouldnt watch the sho
<Yahooz> *show
<DocSane> I'd like to see a Luna and Twilight episode, since Twi is the closest thing Luna has to a friend.
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=luna&offset=264#/d3h0zcc
<RAWRity> Diamond Tiara can go die in a fire
<otakon> hell, I like GILDA and Trixie more than her
<flutterchu> otakon: it's not really fair for celestia she is mentioned in almost every episode deos'nt get an episode about her and luna get's an episode about her and she barely appers on the show
<otakon> and Gilda did the UNFORGIVABLE
<HyperMetalLugia> oh cool
<Meanwhile> otakon: Eh, set them all on fire.
<otakon> flutterchu: well true
<HyperMetalLugia> got quadphonic working
<RainBowJack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfzS_Tg5eUA&feature=g-all-u
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<RAWRity> If we have to have another Luna ep, I'd actually be fare more interested in seeing Luna and Celestia's relationship explored.
<DocSane> Gilda got a raw deal.
<Pinkies4thWall> Well fuck
<Yahooz> fire: best way to kill stufff
<otakon> Meanwhile: but you like ponies! I KNOW YOU DO DAMMIT! otherwise you wouldn't be here
<flutterchu> RainBowJack: seen it
<Meanwhile> otakon: I was talking about the bad ones.
<DocSane> I'd love a Celestia/Luna episode
*MahBoi777 hugs RainBowJack
<RAWRity> Because I see a LOT more potential for an interesting story there than just another "Luna learns to make friends" episode.
<otakon> Meanwhile: ah
<Pinkies4thWall> RAWRity: i can now see luna telling Celestia what she learned
<MahBoi777> lol
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=luna&offset=312#/d4xmpe6
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Thanks for the game Shizu ~
<DocSane> RAWRity: Let it be Luna getting fed up with Celestia and then showing up on Twi's doorstep to sleep over and vent about her sister.
<Shizuka> 13<3
<DeadpoolDash> that was a fun TF2 match
<Shizuka> 13any time~
<Shizuka> 13i mean when i'm awake ofc :3
*RainBowJack hugs MahBoi777 back
<SolairePony89> RAWRity: I'd like to see you write a MLP episode, it'd be quite interesting
<SaxyPretender> 0,14suddenly, TheGreatAndPowerfulT and Shizuka
<Reikim> Thanks so much Shizuka~ <3
<Ponies47> I really wish I could join the TF2 game :(
<Shizuka> 13<3
<flutterchu> want to see my favorite fan pony http://kelseysparrow67.deviantart.com/art/Emoshy-246802587
<Dark92Enigma> Me too Ponies47
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Saxy
<Pinkies4thWall> Sis, today i learned not to piss you off. If I do, you'll most likely abuse my PTSD and start a fight you'll enjoy. Your little sis, Luna.
*Reikim yawns
<DocSane> RAWRity: Twi would be mortified and want to get things patched up quickly and Luna the hell out of her library.
<Shizuka> 13http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2169656 ponies should read that if they think their boxen can't handle tf2
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14i still doubt it would work for me
<DeadpoolDash> almost everything can handle TF2
<DocSane> RAWRity: And then it turns into a whole huge backstory episode.
<otakon> ah, hello Shizuka
<RAWRity> DocSane: and then Luna tells Twi all of Celestia's dirty little secrets, and Twi can never look at her mentor the same way again.
<Shizuka> 13morning
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heck, this netbook is currently at 54C running the basic stuff I usually do
<DocSane> RAWRity: Well, if WE were writing it, yes.

<Yahooz> Cool description bro
<Reikim> RainBowJack: Dude. You're going to get yourself kicked.
<flutterchu> in the nighmare night episode there was a scene where rarity was going to dress up luna but they deleted it you can see the dress on mlp castle creator
<otakon> SaxyPretender: I believe so O____o
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, it is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep SaxyPretender
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<otakon> flutterchu: I remember that, wish they would have kept that scene in
<DeadpoolDash> is that sniper here in chat?
<Yahooz> snoipah?
<applesack> le shak
<Yahooz> where?
<MahBoi777> RainBowJack: O___O
*Reikim snipes Yahooz
<Reikim> Here.
<applesack> apple sack
<RAWRity> Seriously though, if I were ever asked to write an MLP episode, it would end up being like a 3 parter about the CMC getting their cutie marks, drifting apart due to their now pointless organization/exploring their new found passions, and then eventually coming back together after they find that they miss their friends.
<Dark92Enigma> What about a Spike/Rarity episode?
<DocSane> RAWRity: So the episode could start out looking like it's going to be about Luna's relationship with Celestia, and then turn into it being about Twilight's relationship with them both.
<DeadpoolDash> the other sniper reikim
<Yahooz> Blodee hell
<CriticKitten> Twilight Sparkle is best chainsaw wielding zombie killer.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Reikim> RAWRity: Sounds sweet, but I don't think it would ever pass.
<flutterchu> also pipsquek is in another episode in the backround of putting you hoof down http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Pipsqueak/Gallery
<DocSane> RAWRity: Also, why would they drift apart? Sure, they wouldn't be crusading anymore, but they'd still be friends.
<RAWRity> Basically, it'd be an ep building and examing their friendship, changing up the status quo, and putting down all the theories that the CMC would stop having anything to do after getting their cutie marks.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Speaking of writing...how's yours coming along?
<DocSane> RAWRity: It's not like getting their marks is the only thing holding them together
<SolairePony89> ^
<RAWRity> Reikim: on hold for the moment. Swamped with school work, plus planning a party before my friend ships out to the air force.
<flutterchu> i just wonder what ganon's up to
<Yahooz> RAWRity: still in school? ouch
<junh1024-XD> >
<otakon> flutterchu: oh dear God no...
<RAWRity> Yahooz: Summer classes.
<junh1024-XD> :>
<DocSane> RAWRity: There's a ton of stupid schemes they could do that have nothing to do with cutie marks.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Ah, I know that feeling...I just got hit with a bunch of stuff myself. Luckily, I managed to get myself posted on EQD before I did :)
<Yahooz> ah
<RAWRity> until July 11
<HyperMetalLugia> Jun
<Yahooz> double ouch
<Dark92Enigma> What if Discord, Nightmare Moon and Queen Chrysalis JOIN FORCES!?????????????
<HyperMetalLugia> Can I have a 4.1 mp3 @ 320kbps to test out?
<flutterchu> otakon: i know I hate those games
<otakon> SO! Who is excited for the Extended Cut DLC for ME3?
<HyperMetalLugia> :{
<RAWRity> Dark92Enigma: sounds like an awful idea tbh
<DocSane> Why would Discord need to join forces with anyone?
<Yahooz> Dark92Enigma: then plots would not exist]
<flutterchu> why are the games that link talks in are the ones that suck
<DocSane> He's just in it for the lols.
<Dark92Enigma> RAWrity..............Yeah........back to the old drawing board LOL
<RAWRity> generally speaking, 2 villains teaming up tends to cheapen their characters, or rob them of what made them interesting.
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: well, considering NMM is no longer out there, it's already been put forth that Discord and Chrysalis teaming up would probably be hilarious
<otakon> flutterchu: no idea
<Dark92Enigma> otakon that's true
<Reikim> otakon: Discord is trapped.
<SolairePony89> otakon: Somewhat. They'd better find to reverse all of the mass relays exploding, otherwise any ending is gonna be pretty dark
<Dark92Enigma> NEW VILLAIN, PERHAPS?
<otakon> Reikim: he got out from the CMC just FIGHTING in his presence... I'm not sure him being in stone is super permanent
<Dark92Enigma> WWE cameo?
<RAWRity> Honestly I'd be more interested in, say, Discord and Chrysalis trying to enact plans for revenge, only for their plans to colide and cause eachother to fail.
<Reikim> otakon: Well...I've heard some theories that his containment is a little more permanent this time...
<otakon> SolairePony89: no changes, only added dialogue and scenes explaining the ending better
<flutterchu> am i the only one that want's an episode of luttershy doing a sonic rainboom http://mysticalpha.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-Sonic-Rainboom-292111927
<otakon> SolairePony89: so yeah, ending is still pretty dark for everyone
<junh1024-XD> surround mp3s (especially 4.1 material) are hard to come by, and hard to decode
<Dark92Enigma> Internet personality cameo? (Nostalgia Critic, AVGN)?
<RAWRity> otakon: IIRC, the CMC fighting wasn't the cause of him breaking out. It was that Celestia and Luna being disconected from the EoH, all the spells they cast with them no longer held power.
<otakon> flutterchu: no, no you are not. but she'll never have the muscle to do it
<Reikim> flutterchu: Would cheapen the move. It's Dash's signature move. Nobody else can use it, else it loses significance for her as a character.
<HyperMetalLugia> Nobody likes them :p
<junh1024-XD> however, this 448kps AC3 is almost 4.1
<drf|laptop> 03get proper 5.1?
<SolairePony89> otakon: Well, damnit I sure hope they don't say that everyone died anyway, because it seems like that's the only thing that could happen
<flutterchu> bye
<junh1024-XD> http://www.mediafire.com/?dtmlbcqy7crel7w'
<otakon> bye flutterchu take care of yourself
<junh1024-XD> http://www.mediafire.com/?dtmlbcqy7crel7w
<DeadpoolDash> all the Mass Effect games don't matter since they are just stories told by an old man
<SolairePony89> See ya flutterchu
<Ponies47> Bye flutterchu :)
<Dark92Enigma> I'M OUT OF IDEAS.....................
<flutterchu> nevermind

*Ponies47 Makes duckface
<Dark92Enigma> bye flutterchu
*Ponies47 For no reason
<Shamroc> moop
<HyperMetalLugia> But that would requireeffort
<Reikim> RAWRity: On a related note, why DID that disconnect happen? I like to think that, when Celestia banished her sister to the moon, it broke their bond and thus the bond they had with the Elements.
<Bronysith> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=luna&offset=576#/d3gglxr portal luna
<flutterchu> i said NEVERMIND
<otakon> SolairePony89: well, we know from the scene at the end that everything SOMEHOW works out.... but they explain NOTHING or how much time had passed
<HyperMetalLugia> to find 1 speakwer
<HyperMetalLugia> *speaker
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<otakon> Reikim: Elements picked new bearers, reset basically I think.
<Ryunosuke> spoiler: season 3 premier will be a two part ending on a cliffhangar :)
<RAWRity> Reikim: eenope. What broke the power was Twilight and the others becoming the new bearers of the EoH, meaning that all the spells that Luna and Cel cast with them broke.
<otakon> Ryunosuke: THE HELL MAN!
<otakon> ARGH!
<RAWRity> Ryunosuke: doubtful.
*otakon rages
<Ryunosuke> its worked so far :)
<otakon> WHY GODDAMMIT WHY!?!?!?!?!?!?!
<flutterchu> and otakon you say fluttershy deosnt have the muscles but if she thinks of discord or trying to save rainbow dash
<Reikim> RAWRity: Okay then, building off that: how did they become the new bearers? This one has always been a headscratcher for me.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Because your internet is slow. What're you raging about?
<Dark92Enigma> I GOT IT!!!!!! What about...............Ryunosuke WHY U SPOIL?????
<otakon> Meanwhile: 2 parter cliffhanger for the S3 premiere apparently from Ryunosuke
<Dark92Enigma> MMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WILSSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<otakon> flutterchu: well yeah, but she wasn't going full speed either
*Bronysith rages with otakon for no reason and tehn glomps Meanwhile
<HyperMetalLugia> Does Audacity have a 4speaker option too?
<otakon> XD
<SolairePony89> otakon: The scene at the end was WAY to vague. Odds are that was some small colony that survived after all the mass relays were destroyed. The whole fleet in the Sol System is still doomed, as are many other planets unfortunately
<Meanwhile> otakon: According to what source?
<Ryunosuke> I am just saying, season one, and season two were both 2 parters that ended on a cliffhanger after the first episode :)
<DocSane> Reikim: I'm pretty sure they became the new bearers because the EoH were inert after Luna was sent to the moon.
<otakon> Meanwhile: Ryunosuke
<junh1024-XD> no
<HyperMetalLugia> Shame
<RAWRity> Reikim: easy. The elements lay dormant after Cel used them to imprison NMM. When 6 ponies who embodied the elements came together, along with Twi's magic, they unlocked the full powers of the EoH. Thus why they turned NMM back into luna, rather than sending her to the moon again.
*HyperMetalLugia installs vlc then
<otakon> Ryunosuke: they wouldn't DARe do it to us again....would they?
<junh1024-XD> do you have WMP with codecs?
<flutterchu> otakon: what if twilight (even though I hate her) forces fluttershy to go really fast with magic
<Dark92Enigma> Ryunosuke Oh so, no official date, no real info at all?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Oh. That all?
<Meanwhile> Meh.
<junh1024-XD> or MPC/HC?
<sagas[A]> http://images.4chan.org/b/src/1340595192721.jpg
<Reikim> RAWRity: Then why did Celestia have to send Luna to the moon in the first place? She had all the Elements.
<Ryunosuke> Dark92Enigma, not really :p
<otakon> flutterchu: she'd never do it, but why the hate on the main character?
<DocSane> What if the world was made of pudding?
<HyperMetalLugia> I have a couple codecs for WMP
<Ryunosuke> and otakon why not? :p
<RAWRity> Reikim: she couldn't unlock their full potential on her own.
<Meanwhile> What if Nightmare Moon was phone?
<otakon> Reikim: she couldn't use them to their full potential on her own.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: silly, Ponies don't have phones.
<RAWRity> It would be NMM was telegraph
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: lol.
<Dark92Enigma> Ryunosuke then that was...............ENTIRELY POINTLESS (Nostalgia Critic reference)
<Irish_Pony> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d54krgf
<flutterchu> otakon: she's not the main character she just steals screentime i have proof because there called the MANE 6

<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: huzzah! :D
<HyperMetalLugia> the soundblaster config program says I'm doing 4.1 fine
<Reikim> RAWRity: Fair enough. Next question: we know Nightmare Moon's canon origin story. But then, Faust has stated (not in her capacity as creator, and admitted bullshitting) that NMM was partly due to the interference of some outside force. Which one do you prefer; and if the latter, what do you think about said outside force returning for a later episode?
<HyperMetalLugia> so does windoes

<LadyCanary> Hallo everypony <3
<otakon> LadyCanary: how are youd ear?
<DocSane> (Flutterchu is wrapped a bit too tight for Bronystate...)
<SpeedyBolt> Elements of Disorder?
<DuskStarshimmer> Anyone seen Alicorn_Prince_Shane arroudnd lately??
<otakon> DeadpoolDash: Elements of Disharmony?
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: nah man, I think they already started. Like, ages ago.
<flutterchu> otakon: this is why i don't like to trust people
<MahBoi777> hey LadyCanary!

<SaxyPretender> 0,14later DocSane
<RAWRity> Reikim: This is where I have to disagree with Faust. Making it be some outside force that messed with luna essentially takes away her own agency in the whole thing, and takes away from her character's depth. Instead of being a proud/jealous character, wanting to be appreciated, she becomes a pawn used by some undefined evil thing.
<Dark92Enigma> flutterchu Oh, i thought you said ''shoot'

<LadyCanary> ^o^
<flutterchu> LadyCanary: aiight then
<Reikim> RAWRity: Personally, I find a balance between the two. Let's say Luna felt underappreciated, yes? This is fact. I won't disagree with that. Now let's say that she then, because she feels underappreciated, decides to dabble in forces she shouldn't deal with. This then leaves her open to some other entity, who takes hold of that jealousy and then twists it to his own purposes, giving her a powerup in the process. How's that?
<otakon> SaxyPretender: OH! God is back
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Deadpool is a comic book character
<Reikim> Thanks Dari
<TOY_PON3> flutterchu: O:
<SaxyPretender> 0,14The Merc With a Mouth
<RAWRity> Reikim: better, but it still makes her mostly innocent in the affair. At worst, she's ill-advised and stupid for messing with magic beyond her grasp, while here becoming NMM because she lets her feelings of inferiority and rejection fester makes her a more complex, and IMO, relateable character.
<Meanwhile> Deadpool is Marvel comics.
<TOY_PON3> Deadpool is sooo not an anime :P

<Barbetos> It looks really good for an indie game. I wonder why I have not seen it before.
<JRP2234> Nittany_Discord u have garrys mod correct?
<otakon> SaxyPretender: agreed... I like them and all their proper venom
<Sylandest> Om: eeyup! What about you? what do you have going on?
<LadyCanary> RUUUUUUUUUURUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<SolairePony89> Barbetos: It flew pretty far under the radar, unfortunately
<flutterchu> that gun looks like a tank
<superretroworld> i didnt know there were such things as indie games
<Om> Sylandest: Not a whole lot, today was kinda different I spose. Nothing really tho.
<Sylandest> Om: oh? different how?
<Barbetos> Lack of multiplayer is probably what hurt it the most. =\
<Ponies47> Dumb fabric
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey Jun, is the NGE Surround all in .ac3?
<Om> Sylandest: Like I said, nothing really.
<Sylandest> Om: ahh, right, hehe XD
<SolairePony89> Barbetos: Seeing as it's on the PC, I doubt that
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: dumb......uhhhhhh table
<junh1024-XD> i originally downloaded it in FLAC
<Barbetos> SolairePony89 oh yeah. I tend to forget about the consoles. =P
<junh1024-XD> 150MB a song
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: Yay. :>
<junh1024-XD> i compressed it to AC3 for internet distribution
<flutterchu> n64 is best console
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah.
<HyperMetalLugia> hm..
<HyperMetalLugia> How many songs?
<MahBoi777> ^
<HyperMetalLugia> 60?
<otakon> flutterchu: it had no good RPG's
<SolairePony89> Barbetos: PC > Consoles (And I only have a 360)
<RAWRity> http://iammommy.typepad.com/.a/6a00e551040fb78834012877658b86970c-500wi
<otakon> SolairePony89: ET TU!?
<Ponies47> Never had a N64, I was born in 97 :)
<LadyCanary> PANCAKES
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> does Blade Runner sounds good for A movie ?
<SolairePony89> otakon: Yup. I'd give anything for a good PC
<junh1024-XD> 75 songs and 8.5GB
<Barbetos> Ouch
<LadyCanary> y no sausages RAWRity
<Ponies47> CHOCOLATE!
<flutterchu> otakon: i don't even know if it has rpg's
<otakon> SolairePony89: argh dammit man
<junh1024-XD> O1-3
<MahBoi777> cartridges were awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: because Pancakes>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<JRP2234> ded
<HyperMetalLugia> Hm
<otakon> flutterchu: it has like 4
<LadyCanary> :|
<junh1024-XD> same songs as the torrent you got off TPB
<RAWRity> also, I found the PERFECT B movie
<junh1024-XD> except in surround
<JRP2234> Nittany_Discord your not supposed to keep dieing
<RAWRity> Andy Worhal's "Empire"
<otakon> flutterchu: and 3 of those aren't proper turn based RPG's or even similar
<SolairePony89> don't say Never Say Neve RAWRity...
<Ponies47> RAWRity: Nice :)
<otakon> RAWRity: what?
<RAWRity> which is, no joke, an 8 hour static shot of the Empire State Building
<SolairePony89> Hobo with a Shotgun is the perfect B movie IMO
<flutterchu> otakon: never focused on rpg's until i played pokemon i loved banjo kazooie
<HyperMetalLugia> that'll take me
<HyperMetalLugia> 10hrs
<HyperMetalLugia> to download
<Barbetos> Consoles have done a lot of good things though tbh. Not that there is not anything left to be desired these days really, but the consoles really did help to make what gaming is today. I don't think PC could of ever accomplished what consoles have.
<HyperMetalLugia> given I can even get seeded at 250KB/S
*HyperMetalLugia cry
<junh1024-XD> iwndr if i can HEAAC it at 192kps
<HyperMetalLugia> HEAAC? :s
<Ponies47> Here's how you face book
<HyperMetalLugia> What is the HE part
*Ponies47 Puts face in book
<Ponies47> There you go :)
<junh1024-XD> High-Efficiency
<junh1024-XD> its designed for low-bitraest
<SolairePony89> Better than the actual facebook
<drf|laptop> 03> ugh, well that sucks
<drf|laptop> 03> apparently this CPU cooler is too fat and makes it so I can't use the last RAM slot
*Om pokes panda
<RAWRity> But seriously, if I ever get the urge to troll the chat, I'll just put down Andy Worhol's "Vinyl" as my B movie.
<HyperMetalLugia> Does it still keep its surround o-o
<drf|laptop> 03that's why it was erroring
<panda> Om herro ^-^
<drf|laptop> 03not because of wattage
<RAWRity> Because good god damn is that thing unwatchable.
<junh1024-XD> yes
<Ponies47> SolairePony89: I have 2 Facebooks :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay.
<HyperMetalLugia> If you have the time
<Om> panda: It liveth!?
<HyperMetalLugia> Then sure
<panda> Om of course ^-^
<LadyCanary> For some reason I havent been getting the newsletter on time.
<junh1024-XD> if i do that, i could possibly get O1-3 downn to a few hundred megs?
<junh1024-XD> but i need to figure out how to batch it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14how late are you getting it?
<Om> panda: How have you been?
<HyperMetalLugia> To CMD?
<RAWRity> You guys thought that Epic Movie and Babes in Toyland were bad? YOU HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED WORHOL
<panda> Om good, enjoying my bday ;)
<LadyCanary> Later than I should Saxy
<flutterchu> i bet there are no eddheads on this server only bronies like me
<junh1024-XD> batch it in f2k or dBPA
<HyperMetalLugia> or some crazy ffmpeg like program
<Om> panda: Oh right, I forgot it was :$
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean
<junh1024-XD> nah
<panda> Om i knwo, thats why the winking face xD
<HyperMetalLugia> As long as the download isn't > 1.5GB
<HyperMetalLugia> Then I don't mind xD
<junh1024-XD> it'll be based off qAAC, which is a CLI interface for qucktime AAC
<Om> panda: You got me :I
<HyperMetalLugia> Aha
<junh1024-XD> quicktime is the best free AAC encoders
<panda> Om hehe its coolio ^-^
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm surprised
<HyperMetalLugia> Though apple loves AAC
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<junh1024-XD> quality-wise
<flutterchu> swag uber epic coll coolio how many does one word have to mean
<panda> Om i spent the day with homework and drawing anyways
<HyperMetalLugia> hrm, 256kbps will be acceptable
<HyperMetalLugia> That'll be under 2GB
<somepony_else> good morning everypony

<Sylandest> panda: :D nothing, nothing XD
<RAWRity> Plot summary: "A single shot of the Empire State Building from early evening until nearly 3 am the next day."
<panda> Sylandest shush you
<Om> Sylandest: Sylly
<Sylandest> Om: aye? :D

<SolairePony89> RAWRity: Wow. Just... wow
<RAWRity> SolairePony89: that's Worhol for ya
<SolairePony89> RAWRity: Where on earth do you find out about shit like that?
<RAWRity> Andy Worhol's entire artistic career can be summed up as him trying his hardest to look like he wasn't trying at all.
<HyperMetalLugia> 3gb > for 3 full CDs give each CD holds 22 songs max
<Om> Sylandest panda: Now kiss O_O
<HyperMetalLugia> So yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> 256 seems fine .v.
<Sylandest> Om: wha-wha-what?! XD
<HyperMetalLugia> unless my math is wrong
<HyperMetalLugia> and it'll be 300MB
*HyperMetalLugia spazz
<panda> Om what???
<flutterchu> Om: *kisses fluttershy*
<Om> flutterchu: Right >_>;
<RAWRity> His entire message with his art was that anybody could do better than what he did, but because he was provocative he gained success, and thus that modern creativity is hollow and pointless.
<Om> panda Sylandest: :D
<Sylandest> Om: oh you XD

<Sumica> 00,10I wonder how many people have bought this game now that we have been streaming it so often.
<hen3ry> that's usually how I get to Mun... equatorial orbit first, then punch it at moonrise.
<Sumica> 00,10Same hen3ry
<TOY_PON3> Sumica: Maybe if you can kill Kerbals in more ways than i would buy it
<otakon> now
<hen3ry> minmus is tricker tho, but easier to land on when you actually get there.
<otakon> WATCH THEIR FACES
<TOY_PON3> then*
<otakon> WATCH THEM CAREFULLY!
<otakon> and look for the changes
<TOY_PON3> otakon: Oki doki loki
<Sumica> 00,10still having trouble hitting the sun reliably
<Sumica> 00,10so what you want failed space walks too TOY_PON3?
<TOY_PON3> Sumica: As long as someone dies
<hen3ry> failed space walks should be coming in 0.16
<somepony_else> space walks? sounds goooooooood :>
<TOY_PON3> the middle kerbal seems happy
<EonMastor> only a matter of time before that rocket crashes back into the planet
<hen3ry> someone posted a screenshot of a ship landed on the sun in kerbal. But it was a position hack, not a real landing.
<OneTrickPony> hai everyone :D
<Ponies47> Hey OneTrickPony :)

<SolairePony89> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I gotta wait until it's released for the 360 :|
<Sumica> 00,10Sure fire way to get bigger sales in a game now. Put a MLP cast member as a VA in it.
<TOY_PON3> sonicrainboomer259: That's a good enough reason right there
<SolairePony89> Sumica: Part of the reason why I'm gonna get Lollipop Chainsaw ASAP
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> TOY_PON3 John de lance commentary :p
<sonicrainboomer259> SolairePony89: what game?
<hen3ry> you're close enough, Nitt. The moonrise trick is really meant for a 150 km orbit anyway. Punch it.

<TOY_PON3> can they die already?
<hen3ry> you're really too low to the surface to attempt this
<SolairePony89> Don't fail us now Nittany_Discord, you're our only hope
<Pinkies4thWall> OHAI DaringDude

<TOY_PON3> Damn
<SolairePony89> KA-BEWM
<MasterBoss43> Say hi to Luna from me Nittany_Discord!
<Om> Yeah, 100m/s would have been much safer
<hen3ry> Next time start from a 20km altitude so you have time to kill off your angular momentum.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TOY_PON3: never jinx someone
<flutterchu> don't give up i did'nt learn that from twilight
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah use nav ball in map mode to fly from map mode.
<TOY_PON3> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I did though :(
<Pinkies4thWall> dat sumi
<SolairePony89> MasterBoss43: The only way he could do that is if he crashed on Luna
<Sumica> 00,10ahhhh I see.
<sonicrainboomer259> Nittany_Discord: did you do that on purpose?:D
<MasterBoss43> SolairePony89 Didn't you see Luna just standing a little away from the rocket?

<SolairePony89> MasterBoss43: Still though, Nitt died, so in order for him to see Luna she would have to be ded too

<Irish_Pony> Bunny_Maid_Luna: So when do I see this little human/monster version of me? :)
<Sumica> 00,10seems it's the way FF and Flash interact with eachother. It's a new safty feture to prevent flash bugs from being exploited.
<Sumica> 00,10And I bet this same feture is why so many people are having flash crashes so often now.
<MahBoi777> Boomer Nooooooo!

<Chrysalis> hmm, anyone any good at really bizarre bugs?
<Starfrench> wahah somewhat :D
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, how bizarre?
<Starfrench> may be mostly luck though :D
<Chrysalis> while(i >= Count) i-= Count; where Count is 4 and i is a negative number, it gets stuck in an infinite loop
<cow334> LIKE A FAUST
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, is i unsigned?
<Phase4> 00,02needs to be signed
<Chrysalis> nope
<Chrysalis> signed int
<alexxm> Chrysalis what sort of bugs are you talking about
<Phase4> 00,02...huh
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, pastebin the function?
<Chrysalis> lol, was just about to screencap it :P
<Phase4> 00,02that works too
<Sumica> 00,10Good job breakin it hero.
<Phase4> 00,02have to do something while i wait for mips
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/images/stories/1340616518-dDrtCh.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02that seems better
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<diddutz> yay streams up :3
<alexxm> stream
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, is there an aspect ration scale in fmle?
<Chrysalis> hang on... is it forcing an unsigned conversion because count is unsigned...
<Starfrench> ah, dat stream. :D good
<Chrysalis> god damnit c++, it was forcing unsigned conversion
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, might be
<Sumica> 00,10you meen the dropdown or liek a 16:10 thing?
<Chrysalis> but still using signed maths for the increment
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, just use int
<alexxm> i have no idea what that means
<Chrysalis> alexxm an unsigned number cannot be negative
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, scale to 640x480 and add black bars
<alexxm> ok Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> and an signed number uses the first bit to indicate whether its negative or not, which means a negative number is massive if considered as unsigned
<Sumica> 00,10nah noting like that.
<Phase4> 00,02well poo
<cow334> Stream?
<Sumica> 00,10You can set it to 6x4 but it wont have the bars unless the sorce feed does.
<Sumica> 00,10now say if you had a video playing with MPC you could do that.
<Phase4> 00,02vhscreencap will scale like that
<Sumica> 00,10yeah you can force scale with it.
<Chrysalis> Nightly roundup, its 10am
<Sumica> 00,10but it's hard on on your system
<junh1024-XD> sup LU

<Starfrench> mwuahahahahaha
<diddutz> i speak german and english this is enough for me :P
<MadSurge> DED
<Starfrench> diddutz, where in germany :D
<killerpony7733> Phase4: You don't even have a save before the encounter?
<cow334> Phase4: you need a plan
<diddutz> south-west
<Starfrench> O___O
<Starfrench> Mannheim? :D
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, i have one but i'm not sure how far before it is
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, i do
<killerpony7733> Phase4: well if you want to get in there with no hazzle best try it
<killerpony7733> Phase4: a ton of loot once you get to it
<cow334> Phase4: Well lets see? yu do this like a faust
<cow334> you
<flutterchu> no desktop pony :'(
<killerpony7733> I never asked for this
<killerpony7733> Phase4 Any idea what type of build you will use for the game?
<MadSurge> I like the protagonist's VA
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: yeah his voice is god damn godly
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, i'm figuring it as i go
<Phase4> 00,02his va creeps me out
<killerpony7733> Phase4: big hint this game gives a buck ton of xp from stealth and non lethal
<alexxm> he just sounds so emontionless
<flutterchu> alexxm: me
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: unlike many "gritty" heroes nowadays that seem to have eaten cigarettes for 5 years straight
<killerpony7733> alexxm: thats the point how would you be after so much trauma that jensen went through?
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, i noticed that
<alexxm> killerpony7733 good point
<flutterchu> MadSurge: wait you eat cigarettes
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, he was thrown through several glass windows
<Phase4> 00,02shot in the head
<Phase4> 00,02and had a wall colapse on him
<MadSurge> flutterchu: no, but Dr Girlfriend apparently does :D
<Phase4> 00,02in the middle of a fire
<Phase4> 00,02wow, i just realised how boss jensen is
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Theres very few emotional moments with jensen and they make you realise he hides all the trauma in some way as portrayed in the game
<cow334> Like a faust
<Iron_Edge> Phase4: Sheesh....jensen is karma's bitch apparently.
<MadSurge> He survived all that even before he was a cyborg, impressive!
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4:
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234,
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: can we try again?
<MadSurge> I have a question: those "sunglasses" are for him to see, right?
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, i want to play this then tf2
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, i have no clue
<Phase4> 00,02he doesnt need them
<killerpony7733> Phase4: remember to save before the encounter
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, will do
<JRP2234> Phase4......
<MadSurge> Then they probably are to visualize all the stats
<TheRareP0N3> holy hell the chat cleared out
<TheRareP0N3> xD
<flutterchu> dadaq
<Phase4> 00,02it was only trank darts -_-
<killerpony7733> Phase4: if you haven't used your praxis kits yet get the social aug
<MadSurge> YES KILL EVERYONE
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, but i want the heavy thingy
<killerpony7733> Phase4: heavy what?
<Ghosties> 04Kill everyone, I like that option
<Phase4> 00,02move/throw heavy objects
*Ghosties gets his grenades
<Phase4> 00,02and the cary capacity
<killerpony7733> Phase4: isn't that important early on if you do things right
<Phase4> 00,02"whats that sandvich? kill everyone?"
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, but.... vending machines
<Viri> 14back
<Phase4> 00,02:<
*Phase4 00,02is buying it
<killerpony7733> Phase4: i know :D
<killerpony7733> Phase4: yes last 2 on social aug?
<Phase4> 00,02and i want to get the carying capacity too
<Phase4> 00,02cause the pack from steam included the pre-order crap
*Ghosties tosses a bouqet of grenades into the chat
<Ghosties> 04Have fun!
<Phase4> 00,02shotgun and sniper
<Phase4> 00,02that i will never use
<Starflash> >sandbox game -> always kill everyone
<flutterchu> he gonna take you back to the past....... to play the shitty games that sucked ass *hums the rest*
<Phase4> 00,02allso
<Phase4> 00,02they dont give you enough tranq darts
<Phase4> 00,02its quite anoying
*DeadpoolDash never asked for this...he asked for tacos, tacos rule.
<killerpony7733> Phase4: it's kinda hard to do non lethal but thats why it wants you try be creative and very sparing with ammo
<flutterchu> DeadpoolDash: what's up with people and taco's
<Prick> taco
<Justaxes> a headshot with tranq darts is instant knockout
<DeadpoolDash> tacos are awesome and sound cool
<killerpony7733> Phase4: i usually do non lethal on anyone that is not really those really evil guys cause you get no moral xp from those
*Starflash gives DeadpoolDash and SuperBrony64 taco's
<Ghosties> 04I prefer taquitos. Yum.
<Phase4> 00,02i need the space
<flutterchu> screw the aromor go around naked like the ponies
<killerpony7733> Phase4: your choice bud :P
<Phase4> 00,02which i can use to carry stuff to sell and buy praxis kits
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 you done a non-lethal run?
<MahBoi777> mmmmmmm taquitos
<Starflash> MahBoi777: whats a taquito, precious?
<Starflash> they don't have em here in euroland, I believe
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: uh overall yes but with killing only the para military guys and anybody else was non lethal as possible
<Chrysalis> ah so you dont have the achievement?
<Ghosties> 04Taquitos are like meat, veggies, and spices rolled up in a flour tortilla
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: sadly no :D
<Starflash> ooo nice :D
<Chrysalis> its actually a way of making the game easier
<Starflash> I think I made something like that once :T
<Ghosties> 04It's kinda like a burrito
<cow334> WY U KILL AWESOME DANCE MAN
<MahBoi777> they're very good Starflash Lol
<Phase4> 00,02for a moment i though i got away with that
<Ghosties> 04Same principle and junk
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, not kill
<Phase4> 00,02just punch
<Chrysalis> my hard no kills run was definately easier than my normal run before
<Ghosties> 04Just not folded
<flutterchu> badass anyone
<Ghosties> 04Rolled instead of folded
<Justaxes> ive played this game as ghost and it was really frustrating
<Starflash> Ah
<Starflash> So they do have them here
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: i think its due to how you remember places and everything and said ways to gain things etc
<Starflash> but they just call em meat rolls or something.
<Starflash> <_>
<MahBoi777> guess, I'd better head to bed finally, gnight everyone take care
<Chrysalis> the hardest part is not accidentally killing someone
<Justaxes> taser is the best weapon in the game
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: yep
<Chrysalis> cause you can kill with tranqs
<killerpony7733> Phase4: i can guide you through the encounter
<Starflash> Gnight MahBoi777 :D
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, i want to figure it
<Phase4> 00,02thats the fun bit
<killerpony7733> Phase4: alrighty
<killerpony7733> Phase4: but it's generally easy this one
*MahBoi777 hugs Starflash
<diddutz> that dude is a total pushover ^^
<killerpony7733> diddutz: i feel with him he gets alot of flak
<alexxm> crush him
<killerpony7733> alexxm god no that just makes me feel bad
<alexxm> ok killerpony7733 just wanted to see what would happen
<alexxm> and i just killed the chat
<Phase4> 00,02dis isnt working
<cow334> Like a fausr
<killerpony7733> alexxm also notice the emotional jensen here?
<cow334> faust
<alexxm> yeah killerpony7733
<killerpony7733> Phase4 do a new one then
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, it's Indifference: The Game.
<Phase4> 00,02i screwed dat up
<flutterchu> kill him
<diddutz> killerpony7733: i've yust seen some videos, one with that dude, since there are different options what to say i think there are many ways of proceeding through this conversation
<killerpony7733> Phase4: try more forgiving
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, what should my first optio be
<Justaxes> absolve
<Phase4> 00,02option'
<Phase4> 00,02k
<killerpony7733> Phase4 uh show me them
<killerpony7733> Phase4: i'll tell you each time
<cow334> Phase4: haha kill him
<Phase4> 00,02ok...
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, NO :<
<Phase4> 00,02dis jensen is a thinking man
<Phase4> 00,02not a punching man
<Phase4> 00,02though he does that allso
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Ok show me the options
<Kammerjunk> Is this a non-lethal playthough?
<Justaxes> i always use absolvefirst
<cow334> Phase4: aww man well well if you see some one can you FALCO PAWNCH them?
<sub06905> Deus Ex o.o
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Absolve
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, this will take ages with stream lag
<killerpony7733> Phase4: don't worry
<DeadpoolDash> jensen doesn't punch people, he punches walls
<flutterchu> tell him to think about the ponies
<alexxm> use your knife arms on him
<Phase4> 00,02i think its just al absolve
<killerpony7733> Phase4: no no no it's not
<Kammerjunk> Meh. Just act as if you're in a relationship with him: Constantly agree.
<killerpony7733> Phase4: uh last one is different i think let me see the options
<Justaxes> its probably plead...
<Justaxes> but sometimes you can always absolve
<killerpony7733> Phase4: ok options again
<Phase4> 00,02i'm thinking plead
<killerpony7733> Phase4: try that
<Justaxes> nonoon
<killerpony7733> Phase4: it usually leads deeper into the conversation
<Justaxes> but mabye
<sub06905> secret selection: do all 3
<Phase4> 00,02dat didnt work
<killerpony7733> Phase4: wait
<Justaxes> absolve, absolve, absolve
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I'm thinking absolve.
<killerpony7733> Phase4: uh absolve
<killerpony7733> That
<flutterchu> THINK OF THE PONIES WAYNE
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, dat didnt work
<killerpony7733> Ok Phase4 lets try all absolve
<Justaxes> absolve alll the time
<Kammerjunk> Just do pure absolve.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try absolve until it doesnt seem right
<sub06905> sounds like batman
<alexxm> jensens kinky
<Kammerjunk> sub06905: Oh no, Phase is playing Deus Ex: Invisible War.
<sub06905> i know but the voice sounds like batman
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: lolwhut it's not DX IW silly filly
<Phase4> 00,02wait what
<Kammerjunk> IT'S INVISIBLE WAR.
<Phase4> 00,02that was different
<Phase4> 00,02that was a different line
<Justaxes> damn randomization
<Phase4> 00,02dere is random in dis
<alexxm> try a mixture Phase4
<killerpony7733> Phase4: hmm guess social aug would had helped here it usually guides you the right way
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Justaxes> show the options
<killerpony7733> Phase4: wait go crush
<Kammerjunk> Considering that they didn't go LA: Noire on this, the faces in this game look pretty neat.
<killerpony7733> Darnit!
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: yeah the emotional expression of many of the people jensen talk with is amazing take haas for example
<Kammerjunk> Adam, I...
<Phase4> 00,02dat was dumb luck
<killerpony7733> Phase4: there you go
<Justaxes> O_O
<Phase4> 00,02and i kinda feel sorry for that guy

<killerpony7733> Saturn what kind of juice?
<BroKnee> Grape
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Lol important.
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: no, i think it means that my subconscious thinks that everyone hates me because i like guys

<Vordox> Buck those people Saturn
<flutterchu> Saturn: just like me only worse WAY worse

<Saturn> 08,01flutterchu: no, but i am a filthy dog
<Vordox> Saturn: A filthy dog? But you are A FREE dog!
<Ghosties> 04My personal philosophy is: The longer and more defined and/or thicker your facial hair is, the more manlier you are
<Spell-of-Gaming> Who's streaming?
<killerpony7733> Spell-of-Gaming: Phase4
<Vordox> ORLY Ghosties ?!

<Ghosties> 04That, my good Vordox, is the very definition of 'gentleman'
<MasterBoss43> Vordox I think i am getting a moustache that looks like that!
<Vordox> Oh?
<MasterBoss43> :D
<MadSurge> Ghosties: I can't grow decent facial hair :'(

<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: the stereotype of manliness is stupid, I am kinda possess feminine traits but overall am a masculine person
<Ghosties> 04He is creative and handles his free time well
<Vordox> And from somewhere below germany
<Justaxes> did you know that in 18th century russia men were forced to shave their beards.
<Saturn> 08,01which is funny, because my heritage lies in an area of india that is hindu, not muslim
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear Japan, stop making me learn Japanese just for your RANDOMNESS AND NICO NICO DOUGA.
<BroKnee> killerpony773 I'm just really feminine, and proud of it ^-^
<Vordox> Saturn: Dat prejudice... ._.
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: I've wanted to have a female body since I was 8 years old. Hence my hatred of manliness
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: when i came back from Germany, I learned 2 things
<MadSurge> Saturn: indians have nice beards too :D
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: hehe thats nice you are who you are :P
<flutterchu> who's best pony
<Ghosties> 04Dear Hideo Kojima: Keep making Japan an awesome place.
<BroKnee> killerpony773 Thank you ^-^
<Vordox> Ghosties: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kucrs7byid1qa7ka2o1_250.jpg <--- This beard then? :P
<Vordox> Saturn: Which was?
<Saturn> 08,011) having a full-on beard does not bode well in an airport; 2) border control officers have absolutely no sense of humour
<Spell-of-Gaming> NICO NICO DOUGA HAS PONY EPISODES
<MasterBoss43> Same, FairysHuff! (Only because they have b'o'o'b's...)
<Vordox> Saturn: You mean germany OR USA?
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: understandable, I accept my body as it is :D
<BroKnee> killerpony7733 At least I can say I'm deviant right? xD
<Vordox> Oh Saturn You said you liked hot guys? :P
<Ghosties> 04Airport security and officials do *not* play about that shit, Saturn
<Spell-of-Gaming> I literally screamed when I some.
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, 1) havin ga full-on beard does not bode well in an airport when you're brown
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: deviant? uhhh explain that one to me
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: Fluttershy is an honorary japanese :)
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUus_-DEpTA <-- For Saturn.
<FairysHuff> I loath my body. To me my body is just a bag of meat and bone that houses my mind. My body is not who I am.
<Vordox> ONLY SATURN!
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: neither, this was in the UK
<Vordox> NOONE ELSE WATCH it..
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: i don't understand the context of what you said atleast
<Vordox> And now I get kicked
<Vordox> Forgot we had a stream >< Sorry Phase4
<BroKnee> killerpony7733 Departing from usual or accepted standards, esp. in social or sexual behavior.
<Phase4> 00,02i sware that guy is kermit
<BroKnee> :3
<Ghosties> 04FairysHuff, what you need is Dr. Steinman and his scalpel
<Saturn> 08,01there i was, walking along, minding my own business, when i get approached by a big, burly border guard, who asked me "how long are you planning on staying in this country, sir?"
<Vordox> Can one mod please kick me?
<Vordox> <3 Thank you, I should not go unpunished. ><
<FairysHuff> Ghosties: Sadly I realised my desire too late in life. If I had surgery now I'd come out looking like a hideous cross between male and female. Rather than the cute girly I am.
<Saturn> 08,01to which i replied, in a fake indian accent: "as long as I possibly can"
<Saturn> 08,01which, technically, was an entirely accurate statement
<BroKnee> Saturn xD Rofl
<Vordox> Saturn: Since when has UK been a paranoic country?
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: ah stereotype but you mean you brake the typical mold, Yeah honestly i'm in that place too i have long hair a somewhat masculine face though some slight feminine traits there and a somewhat masculine though some feminine traits in it too :D
<Ghosties> 04Huff, are you anatomically male or female?
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: not paranoid, just racist
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: last part was about my body
<TrixieBaconMuffin> should have gone all pinky on him : FOREEEEVEEEEEER
<Vordox> Saturn: UK? Bloody hell I missed out
<FairysHuff> Ghosties: Physically male, mentally female.
<Saturn> 08,01so i got pulled away and questioned for 2 hours
<Vordox> Saturn: What did you think of the video between? ;)
<Ghosties> 04Gotcha
<flutterchu> ill be on eqd
<Saturn> 08,01so yeah, there's a time and a place for flippancy
<BroKnee> killerpony Nah I just have extremely feminine traits all around, long hair, feminine hand, feminine figure, and for the most part I like just about anything girls do, but I'm sill pretty manly personality wise
<Saturn> 08,01and it turns out that at an airport is neither of these
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: Can we swap bodies?
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: yeah thats you as a person pretty much :)
<TrixieBaconMuffin> The suicide bomber answer would have been , for the rest of my life ^^
<BroKnee> FairysHuff Nope :3 I love it to much
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: Poopy head ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, this guy literally chased after me, and this was before i'd opened my mouth. he saw me walking along, and came running up to me
<Saturn> 08,01random checks, my fat brown arse
<BroKnee> FairysHuff I don't have the typical roughness that an average male's body would
<Vordox> Saturn: How rude...
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, this is turning into a rant
<FairysHuff> Saturn: mmmm fat brown arse.... ^_~ LOL

<Vordox> BE CAREFUL!
<FairysHuff> Just an interesting point on sexuality by social definition. In old Japan during the height of Samurai influence. It was seen as the done thing for two warriors to engage in sex. Women were viewed as a lesser gender.
<BroKnee> Vordox: O.o Your right thats one hell of a desk

<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: It's sits in most peoples nature to wanting to be ordered what to do and how to live
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: I wish I could. Sadly I am limited because of my body. But aside from that I act and am the way I want to be. I learned a long time ago that acting the way others expect will just make you miserable.
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733: Sadly true

<Saturn> 08,01BroKnee: i guess i'm kinda lucky in that respect. i only fully realised my sexuality when i was 17. before that, people would see me as kinda odd, but when i realised that a lot of this "oddness" made sense. i mean, people still found me odd after that, but i could wear my oddness with pride
<Vordox> Phase4: ?! WHAT?!
<DeadpoolDash> lolz

<MadSurge> Lil_B: :T teachers.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Cypresswolf
<Sx963> good morning Cypresswolf :)
<Cypresswolf> killerpony7733: already about 5 there? Have a drink for me
<Randomnerd> Hey all.
<killerpony7733> Cypresswolf: it's 2:39 ish PM
<Ghosties> 04Yes, JRP, I hate you
<Lil_B> User0 Physics, we made an experiment how the lenght and the thickness of a wire releates to the electrical resistance
<cow334> LIVE AND LEARN
<cow334> YEAHAA
<Randomnerd> So it's coming down in buckets here. I may just have to walk outside to take a shower.
<User0> Lil_B: That's kinda snazzy
<Ghosties> 04I'm kidding, JRP. What's up?
<Phase4> 00,02dast enough tf
<Phase4> 00,02tf2'
<Sx963> aw D:
<User0> awww
<Phase4> 00,02um...
<User0> does this mean I have to do work now? (I'm at work...)
<kempa> hey streamer, show us some MLP! :D
<JRP2234> :(
<Lil_B> Randomnerd where do you live? It just rained here very hard :/
<killerpony7733> kempa: we see too much of it here
<Sx963> kempa, there's a time and a place XD
<WallDives> someone failed to realize that this is BRONYstate, not PONY state...
<Vordox> Phase4: Some L4D? :P
<Cypresswolf> I gotta go around and check everyone's tools - :| Really shouldn't have to do this, construction workers should have tools already - it's a major part of the profession for pete's sake
<Randomnerd> Lil_B: Lower NY
<Lil_B> kempa 1# rule of Bronystae... do not talk about Ponys
<killerpony7733> Phase4: could go for L4D2 tbh :P
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, but i dont realy want to
<Vordox> nvm then
<killerpony7733> Phase4: fair enough
<Ghosties> 04BronyState emphasizes a heavy policy on the Brony aspect of the community, instead of strictly ponies. What this means is that this site is primarily dedicated to the fan, so outlets like movies, games, discussions, art, etc. is focused on you guys: the Bronies. While we are known to be the number 1 streaming service for FiM episodes, we offer much more than just ponies.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Lil_B> Randomnerd ok XD so there is no realation than, I'm in germany
<Phase4> 00,02like dis
<JRP2234> Ghosties why do i have to have one proplem after another
<DeadpoolDash> I hate spies
<Sx963> who doesn't.?
<Ghosties> 04I don't know how to answer that, JRP
<cow334> Bye every one
<killerpony7733> Imagine a site that runs ponies 24/7 it would get old as heck in less then a few days
<JRP2234> you should
<cow334> i have to go
<Sx963> bye cow334
<Ghosties> 04I should know how?
<cow334> BAI BAI
<Ghosties> 04Have a good one, cow
<User0> Yay, I can continue to goof off!
<Cypresswolf> I'd have gotten bored of this fandom quick if all the stream showed was ponies - ponies are nice but that alone doesn't make the world go around
<cow334> thanks Ghosties
<JRP2234> this problem refers to you Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Sure thing
<Ghosties> 04How does this problem refer to me, JRP
<JRP2234> dont worry
<Vordox> You know..
<Vordox> Coming into someone domain to DEMAND being entertained...
<Vordox> It's like you walk into a strangers house and ask for food.
<Vordox> Would you do that?
<JRP2234> Phase4 your stream is out of sync by at lest 2 mins
<dr-whooves> WHAT IS THIS O.o
<Phase4> 00,02huh, i cant resize the window
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, ah
<Ghosties> 04Well, for one thing, you ask for food you don't demand it if you really needed it
<Lil_B> afk, trying to do some more musics :)
<Phase4> 00,02dat should fix it
<Lil_B> musics*
<Ghosties> 04Secondly, JRP, what problem are you talking about. If it involves me I'd like to know what it's about.
<JRP2234> yes
<JRP2234> and dont worry about it
<JRP2234> anyways i need to sleep
<dr-whooves> Holy CRAP a science game O.o
<Sx963> for science!
<Ghosties> 04So it refers to me and you won't even tell me
<Ghosties> 04...the hell was that all about?
<User0> Ghosties: apparently so...
<Ghosties> 04You know, if nobody communicates their problems then nothing gets better...
<Vordox> Ghosties: ZA WARUDO
<Ghosties> 04That doesn't mean you should lay all your problems on someone, that's just too much. But if someone has a problem about something and it directly involves someone else, then you should tell that someone else your problem
*Midnight_Tempest smashes
<d3rb> jrp isnt here anymore Ghosties
<User0> d3rb: he knows, he's just saying
<Vordox> Ghosties: The world doesn't work like that
<d3rb> oh....okie dokie :)
<d3rb> but i agree 100%
<d3rb> words of wisdom with Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04User0's right, but my point still stands
<Ghosties> 04And Vordox that's why there's so many problems as it is
<Vordox> Ghosties: I know.
<Ghosties> 04Nobody wants to voice what's wrong

<d3rb> its not astonaut killing, its strength testing.....FOR SCIENCE
<Phase4> 00,02allso discord narates it
<Ingwaz> Phase4: tada
<killerpony7733> User0: so obvious he said it in MLP FIM season 2
<Ingwaz> Phase4: wait? seriously? he does?
<killerpony7733> Ingwaz: listen
<Phase4> 00,02dis is goign to be fiddly
<User0> killerpony7733: I know...
<Randomnerd> It's Q.
<Ingwaz> ....i want this game now
<Randomnerd> lol
<Ingwaz> john de lancie does have a sexy voice
<dr-whooves> ^this
<Ingwaz> dat fail
<Ethereal> Like a pansexual bunny rabbit..
<Ingwaz> pandimensional...not pansexual
<Ethereal> I know.
<Ethereal> I was only messing around
<Ingwaz> Phase4: is john de lancie supposed to be your uncle or w/e in this game?
<String_Shredder> Death Star?
<Phase4> 00,02Ingwaz, yest
<Ingwaz> Phase4: i want this game now...
<Alchemist> you know you might be procastrinating when you have read 4 pages of material in six hours...
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<[iPad]JRP2234> Nnnnnn
<User0> Alchemist: I'm at work... as in sitting in a cube and blatently goofing off
<Ghosties> 04WHAT I LEARNED IN BOATING SCHOOL IS...., Alchemist?
<Ghosties> 04Procrastination at its finest
<[iPad]JRP2234> Bees
<Ingwaz> oh god...when its slowed down i hear a high frequency sound
<[iPad]JRP2234> Dat ghosties
<Cypresswolf> That drinking bird gives me a neat idea :)
<Cypresswolf> and my chat crashed
<Ethereal> John de Lancie played someone in the most recent series of Torchwood. This is how I know of the guy. :3
<User0> Cypresswolf: turn this game into a drinking game?
<[iPad]JRP2234> Why does my dreams shatter
<Cypresswolf> :D Berry Punch Drinking Pony
<[iPad]JRP2234> Why does everything reject me
<String_Shredder> DISCORD. that's how I know John de Lancie
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<killerpony7733> User0: i should do that due to the fact i'm really good at closing my browser
<d3rb> who rejects you [iPad]JRP2234 ?
<Ghosties> 04JRP...what are you talking about?
<[iPad]JRP2234> Everything
<Randomnerd> I'm getting a Portal Vibe.
<d3rb> we don't, do we?
<Randomnerd> Anyone else feeling that?
<Ghosties> 04And what is everything, JRP?
<Midnight_Tempest> i reject your reality and substitute my own
<Cypresswolf> wonder how I'd go about that...carve from wood maybe....
<RoboGerbil> somepony needs to make an all out high quality dovahkiin fluttershy pic
<[iPad]JRP2234> No further questions
<killerpony7733> ^What Midnight_Tempest said
<killerpony7733> Dat timing
<d3rb> someone from portal had something to do with this game Randomnerd...i i recall correctly
<Phase4> 00,02they need to polish this a bit
<Randomnerd> Well done, Captain! You must be the Pride of Ponyville!
<[iPad]JRP2234> Night ponies
<Randomnerd> Bye, [iPad]JRP2234
<d3rb> [iPad]JRP2234: cmon man, why bring up something if you don't wanna talk about it, this isn't facebook
<Randomnerd> Gnight
<User0> d3rb: that is, sadly, so true...
<Cypresswolf> This mansion makes quite a statment :)
<Cypresswolf> and that statement is -
<Kammerjunk> This sounds so much like Q.
<d3rb> i cant stand when people on fb do that. Person A. :( person b. whats up? person a: I dont wanna talk about it.....FUUUU
<Midnight_Tempest> it is Kammerjunk
<Ingwaz> Phase4: so, curious, enjoying the game so far?
<Kammerjunk> Oh wow.
<String_Shredder> Cypresswolf: This statement is false
<Cypresswolf> I have so much money I can't possibly spend it all
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Yep i knew as soon as i heard
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, his voice is so sexy.
<Ingwaz> d3rb: a word to the wise, never play the pony drinking game with lesson zero
<Phase4> 00,02Ingwaz, its the same brand of liquid happy that makes portal soo good
<Ingwaz> Phase4: but do they execute it properly?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: one could continue listening to his voice everyday
<d3rb> lol how did you go the next morning Ingwaz :D
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: That one could.
<d3rb> last i remember it was 9 shots in a very short time
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: hehe :D
<Phase4> 00,02Ingwaz, i'd say so, its not 'as' polished as portal, but portal was from valve
<Ghosties> 04<d3rb> [iPad]JRP2234: cmon man, why bring up something if you don't wanna talk about it, this isn't facebook <-- I'm beginning to believe he does it for attention. If something is really bad enough, however, it should talk to someone and fast.
<Ghosties> 04*he should talk
<Phase4> 00,02so the gameplay is a smidge more dificult than it should be, but its otherwise perfect so far
<Ingwaz> d3rb: i didnt even make it to next morning, i was horribly horribly sick at around 3am and stayed that way pretty much all day. i think its possible it was compounded by food poisoning
<d3rb> yes, no one wants anyone to do anything drastic
<User0> Ghosties: yeah, probably
<d3rb> Ingwaz: lol oh man that sucks
<[iPad]JRP2234> No not attentiom
<String_Shredder> Ghosties: This si turning into Facebook fast. Hopefully the duckfaces won't show up.
<String_Shredder> *is
<d3rb> we are trying to help you [iPad]JRP2234 if you are having problems
<[iPad]JRP2234> Sothing bad is happening
<Ingwaz> d3rb: i suspect consuming a decent amount of alcohol in such a short time did not help things at all
<[iPad]JRP2234> And goodnight
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<d3rb> no Ingwaz i doubt that helped at all :D better luck next time, pace it out
<Phase4> 00,02something portal could do
<Phase4> 00,02that this game cannot
<Phase4> 00,02is get you out of traps
<d3rb> [iPad]JRP2234: goodnight
<Phase4> 00,02i'm stuck in this room with no way to proceed other than death
<Memme> Sounds fun.
<Ingwaz> d3rb: i dont think i'll drink that heavily again, i'm not much of a drinker really, just wanted to see how it would affect me more or less
<Phase4> 00,02portal was designed to detect this and usualy drop a cube to get you out, or open a portal
<Memme> But in this game you're on your own?
<Ingwaz> Phase4: i never really had that sort of thing happen in portal
<Cypresswolf> I better skedaddle on out of here - :) how many times have you heard someone say that :P
<Midnight_Tempest> doesnt mean its a bad design... you just have to think your way through it better Phase4
<String_Shredder> Phase4: I got stuck once in the original Portal
<Phase4> 00,02Ingwaz, its designed to not happen
<User0> Cypresswolf: a lot, my last roommate...
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, but when someone fails, or what happend then where the box glitched out of my grip
<d3rb> well you really went head first into that, 9 shots in that amount of time, even a moderate to heavy drinker would think twice about that......before drinking them anyway :D
<Ingwaz> Phase4: indeed, usually the puzzles had a way for you to get our unless of course you just went looking for an inescapable box
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, its anoying, but not fatal. but detecting it allso creates another chalenge
<Phase4> 00,02finding traps was a thing in portal
<Midnight_Tempest> Phase4: its a new game... give it time and several of those problems will be solved in patches...
<Ingwaz> d3rb: yeah...i got a little cocky since last time i did 5-6 in an hour and was fine afterwards, thought 3 more wouldnt be that big of a deal
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Tempest, it was released only a few days ago, these problems are minor
<Phase4> 00,02its otherwise a gem
<Ingwaz> Phase4: worth the $15 price tag then?
<Ingwaz> or the $20 for season pass?
<Midnight_Tempest> i would say just buy the game and make up your own mind... if it looks interesting, get it
<d3rb> if its even remotely as cool as portal im getting it
<Ingwaz> suddenly got very quiet...
<Ingwaz> d3rb: i think its supposed to have a lot more variety than portal, with things you can do i mean
<d3rb> then i'm sold, i'll get it sometime
<Bronysith> im gay for john d lancies voice
<Midnight_Tempest> the only problem i have with games like Portal 2 is there isnt any replay value after finishing it... i honestly never touched Portal 2 until about a year after i played it, and that was to play with Shizuka online...
<Ethereal> I'm gay for John Barrowman.
<Ethereal> :3
<killerpony7733> Going to take a shower i'll be back in a bit everypony
<Midnight_Tempest> that name sounds familiar... Jack Harkness?
<Bronysith> im gay for...christopher eccleston, David tennant, and kamina and simon
<Ethereal> Yup, Midnight_Tempest
<Bronysith> and spitfire, braeburn
<Ethereal> and me too Bronysith. Well, the first two anyway. :3
<Midnight_Tempest> Ethereal: thought as much... Torchwood... saw him in Doctor Who first though
<Bronysith> Ethereal: have you seen gurren lagann? i am super gay for kamina and grown up simon
<Ethereal> No I haven't, Bronysith.
<Bronysith> watch it sometime
<Ethereal> I also have a crush on Eve Myles. :3

<Sylandest> Bronysith: and how did this come about? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont even know who braeburn is'
<Bronysith> String_Shredder: and tennant
<Bronysith> Sylandest: i said i was gay for john d lancies voice
<d3rb> twilight_sprinkle: :O
<String_Shredder> Bronysith: especially dari
<Midnight_Tempest> lay off the gay shit... its too early in the morning for it and im easily pissed off right now...
<Sylandest> Bronysith: completely understandable XD
<Bronysith> and David tennant, and christopher eccleston and kamina and simon from gurren lagann
<Bronysith> spitfire and braeburn of course
<Sylandest> !!
<MadSurge> <3 De Lancie's voice
<Sylandest> Bronysith: I dont know how i would approach that question, lol. ive never put thought to it :$
<Sylandest> ok, thats creepy
<pony_653> wat the fuck is taht
<pony_653> looks more like scp 178 than a lab assistant
<Ghosties> 04Midnight_Tempest, why do I feel like I've seen you before? Like on Ponychan? Do you go there?
*Bronysith glomps Ghosties
<Sylandest> howdy, Ghosties!

<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: quantum conundrum
<Hawkie> reh
<User0> d3rb: that always worries me more...
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: is it like a first person puzzle solver?
<Sylandest> :D
<Sylandest> I love this game already
<Midnight_Tempest> inb4 d3rb is 'upgraded' by his computer
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: looks that way trolololo. made by someone who worked on the masterpiece that is portal
<d3rb> wait....ok kinda mostly fixed...good enough
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: cool, thanks
<d3rb> oh that would be so sweet Midnight_Tempest
<d3rb> i welcome my computer overlords with open robot arms
<Midnight_Tempest> d3rb: no it wouldnt... you would be a cyberman and i would have to get the doctor to kill you in some silly way
<MadSurge> Emphasis on "sily"
<Phase4> 00,02these are starting to make me think
<d3rb> open....robot...arms, bring on the multitasking brain
<Sylandest> Phase4: thats a good thing...right?
<Bronysith> Phase4: ya think?

<FairysHuff> Ingwaz: It's 17 degrees C outside. No wind and alot of cloud cover trapping the heat.
<SuperGotenks1989> Slow Time and Fluffy, correct?
<Ingwaz> FairysHuff: lol, only 17C?

<FairysHuff> Ingwaz: Scotland.
<FairysHuff> I have my desk fan on full sitting right next to me ^_^ I'm that hot
<Ingwaz> FairysHuff: guess temperatures must be much milder there. here during the summer 17C would be seen as very very unusual. our normal temp in the summer ranges from 26-36C
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: you now must mimic filly fluttershy saying yay into the fan. do it. do eeet
<FairysHuff> Ingwaz: I would be hospitalised if it was that hot here O_o

<SuperGotenks1989> oops
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: :D
<FairysHuff> I have some weird dreams. I have a vague memorie of discovering a hidden mountain monestary in Sweden along the coast in X-Com world map O_o
<SuperGotenks1989> Oh, we've had bigger.
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: its just exactly 100 bronies
<FairysHuff> <--- Has been playing a lot of X-Com
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: thats an oddly specific dream XD
<CountDoofus> Guys, I'm thinking of participating in the EqD drawing contest. Anyone have any critiques on a sketch I've made of a mental Trixie?
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Had another where I was eating a sandwich and the mayonnaise kept squirting out everywhere
<SuperGotenks1989> Well, give us the link.
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: O.o odd dreams indeed XD
<MadSurge> Awww
<MegaMoonShine> FairysHuff: Ok, that's pretty messed up :D
<FairysHuff> MegaMoonShine: Which one? ^_^ LOL They both are
<User0> Darn, I finally got assigned a task (I'm at work right now...) so I have to go... the chat will probably be just a little too distracting
<MadSurge> awww
<Sylandest> laters, User0 :$
<MegaMoonShine> Bye User0
<FairysHuff> User0: Laters
<SuperGotenks1989> I had a dream that I was molested by Molestia, gagged, and forced to listen to Jb's music while Morgan Freeman rubbed my feet.
<MegaMoonShine> :S
<Sylandest> SuperGotenks1989: ....my brain is full of wat
<FairysHuff> SuperGotenks1989: Doesn't sound bad to me ^_^
<CountDoofus> SuperGotenks1989: sec, phone :)

<Razyn> SuperGotenks1989 lay off the sauce
<User0> See ya Sylandest, MegaMoonShine, and FairysHuff.
<Bronysith> NINJAz
<SuperGotenks1989> lol ninja joke
<FairysHuff> Don't you hate it when you have a life altering dream then you wake up and you've completely forgotten it?
<MadSurge> A NINJA
<MegaMoonShine> I guess it did alter the present a little :D
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: had that happen too many times, lol
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Yuppers ^_^
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: i tried having a few dreams where i did something in the real world in my dream and ended up doing it sometime later a day and realising it
<FairysHuff> I had one that I only partially remember where I was living happily as a 14 year old girl. Then I woke up and cried. >_>
<CountDoofus> Alright. So EqD's drawing competition is about ponies playing with pony toys. I had the idea of Trixie pulling the head from a Twilight brushable. http://derpy.me/--nFc
*Sylandest hugs FairysHuff
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: *Cuddles*
<twilight_sprinkle1> killerpony7733: i had a lot of those

<MegaMoonShine> CountDoofus: That's pretty good :)
<killerpony7733> twilight_sprinkle1: they are odd as heck you do it without knowing it and you do it exactly like in your dream
<FairysHuff> Think I had better take some painkillers. Heat is making my head worse.
<twilight_sprinkle1> killerpony7733: ikr, and it sucks that you never remember them until it happens
<killerpony7733> twilight_sprinkle1: i could remember them but i carried out the dream irl without knowing actually
<FairysHuff> ANyone in the UK who would be willing to let me use them for cuddles? ^_^
<twilight_sprinkle1> killerpony7733: i never remember the dream until it happens irl, and from what i remember im never able to break free of it

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Bronysith: shoulda been here earlier whe Phase4 made it to mun again i shoewd him that first pic
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Yeh but I understand why it's mod stream only. You just know if they left it open for the community that SOMEONE would abuse it
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVAsupiz1X8&list=LLPmfUdZCubIyL9L7qgTtaeA&feature=mh_lolz

*User0 nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
<SuperGotenks1989> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNSUszI5g4A
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Though there could be a Trusted list of community people who aren't mods that could stream. That could be a thing.
<Bronysith> This is me evertime i play frogger http://i.imgur.com/eGMrb.gif

<Sylandest> FairysHuff: hmm...eh, maybe. But still, that list would be kept to a bare minimum, likely
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: how are you today?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Mellow~
<Meanwhile> Marshin your mellow?
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Thats fair enough. It would help flesh out the stream more and fill up dead air time.
<User0> Mellow Yellow?
*Bronysith marshes Meanwhile s mellow stache
*CCCP nomz Meanwhile
<FairysHuff> Sylandest: Trouble is, how do we convince the mods? O_o
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: true...there'd have to be an interview process. and likely monitoring by one of the main mods
<SuperGotenks1989> This is a little thing I did on DeviantART. http://sonnikuuu77.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d54uvfx
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/6-3wp2VVhKQ
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: they always listen to ideas, but we cannot convince so much as merely suggest. they're the authority here, not us

<MadSurge> AgentKalim: without anyone to torture, maybe, but I think he's very careful about that
<CCCP> I havn't seen Space is 20% cooler on the stream in a while :(
<FairysHuff> Vordox: Thats a good idea

<prince-dari> >I could care less
<prince-dari> Fuck this song
<prince-dari> It's a piece of shit
<Sylandest> Alchemist: i thought thats what it said in the opening bit?

<DrHobo> prince-dari: critical. .-.
<sagas[A]> Its tolerable and nice

<Sylandest1> GilDash: its been ages since i had pizza
<Soital> 12Speaking of dreamworks I watched prince of egypt so many times a few days ago LOL
*Barbetos|Atwork wears the bucket like a hat, all jaunty like
<TheHoodyNinjuh> rio: that would mean we are all just figments of your imagination
<Soital> 12<3

<MadSurge> Oh Pinkie,I understand you completely :D
<GilDash> Pizza is so wonderful. :)

<Meanwhile> It's suddenly very warm in here...
<Aurora> that is like the diamond of pencil animation
<Airpuff> Freefall29: american is pizza. And btw its from italy i think
<GilDash> Airpuff: I'm sure I can make you some if you're feeling peckish. ;)
*TheHoodyNinjuh looks around rio's head "A little roomy in here"
<Soital> 12Yes, beautiful animation =)
<Angel_Espeon> 13Never seen it

<Angel_Espeon> 13The other day I also realised I've never watched Aladdin before
<rio> well i have one way to prove if real i cant make up everything all at once within secs brain is not that fast
<CCCP> Baby, baby, baby, oh Baby, baby, baby, oh Baby, baby, baby, oh
<MahBoi777> PIZZA is best vegetable
<Freefall29> just because it has sausages and meatballs does not automatically make it italian
