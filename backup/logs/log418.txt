<Roara|Animating> 6nope
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Chrysalis: I am an agressive person, just now a more sensible one
<ScootaChicken> Well, it's less the sport itself that pisses me off and more the rabid following it has.
<Dken2021> most of my friends played fro schools, I played in a band
<NightSeas> 02really? XD
<fluttercry> 05,15You know what I did as a kid? Got bullied and sat by myself.

<ScootaChicken> Wait, is regulars room a secret channel?

<freefall29> requim for a dream
<KaitoThePony> i did not force her to though
<Krakass> But it's not super secret because it still shows up on a whois
<Kyu> 07nowadays millions of dorks take pictures of dumb poses with a dumb phone camera every time they go to a bar to get drunk and act dumb
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I find it funny when I see tourists take photos of random things

<MadSurge> So she wasn't traumatized, good CCCP :D
<Anotherguy> My brother has ponyfobia
<Krakass> Oh.

<Dken2021> maybe we're underestimating little girls now
<KaitoThePony> she got on youtube and found it o3o
<Yahooz> its now under +s
<CCCP> i felt bad afterwards though
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I mean, that's not exactly memories as much as that's a nightly dose of being stupid :P
<cachi01> i made all my friends watch cupcakesHD LOL
<freefall29> well, whatever psychological scars you give her, the blood is on your hands
<Krakass> Maybe it does if you're already in the room?
<Yahooz> Which actually makes it secrey

<FillyFlam> Hiya Jaketehsnake
<Kammerjunk> Great, I'll have to buy more inventory space on TF2 soon.
<drfsupercenter> 03phone cameras are almost always horrible
<Kyu> 07and we're back to that

<Dken2021> lali-ho kingqball
<rainbowdash002> saw it when it came out my first 3 hr movie
<NightSeas> 02megapixels are size, size of the sensor is where it's at
<ScootaChicken> StinkomanFan: Was that the episode where Kenny dies?
<StinkomanFan> All the hats
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: Holy caucasian males, man.

<kingqball> *glomps all* I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!
<asneakykitty> titanic 2 was so much better

<drfsupercenter> 03Samurott, your point? Liking them is an opinion too
*Kyu runs
<NightSeas> 02the only things they make that I don't like are their Nanos and iPads
<rainbowdash002> yes it was krakess

<Yahooz> TheRainbowDash: he was refrencing gladiator
<DrGNs> or Hell whatever floats your boat
<pablez94> no more inspired DeathStar do u wanna go on? *evil smile*

<Vivix> I like Chrysalis way more than Discord, but I wasnt a big Discord fan. Though I do love the episode
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> kinda funny at first i thought she was possesed by NMM before the Changeling Queen revealed herself hehe
<JanisJopleyBird> i kind of hope the season three premeire isnt another eic two-parter, if they happen too often they will lose their mystique
<Radu> http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Cadance
<TheRainbowDash> Best singing of the show so far...:)
*Randomnerd is 172 lbs at 5'7. :(

<Vivix> Cadence or Cadance, choose freely
<Dashie_Dashie> ;A;
<pablez94> Anotherguy: da bad one is chrysalis da good is princess Mi AMore Cadenza or more simply "Cadence"
<RoflBot> Luna : Did i miss anything? . Celestia:... NOPE
<RainbowAsh> JanisJopleyBird, I think one or two per season is ok. I would prefere a three parter, though
<Svettponny> *moar shivers*
<K_A> It's part of her plan to feed off love and become powerful once more. Careful guys.
<EpicPwnTime> little kids:oh no! chrysalis is gonna marry shing armor! bronies:LITTLE MERMAID!
<brony_158> The thing is she is E.V.I.L! Discord just wanted to mess around
<Vivix> Cadenza implies Cadence to me
<Wondershy> Chrysalis, yeah that's it. :P
<Randomnerd> So.
<Starfire_Cuddlecake> this is perfect
<KingLeoACK> All the villains need to come back in season 3.....
<Cypresswolf> that emotion :)
<Starfire_Cuddlecake> brilliant
<Big_Macinsocks> QUESTION: Woudl this song be as good without the animation to back it up?
<Invi> CreativePonyName why?
<Palyk> The finale could have easily been a feature-length movie.
<LeeroyWingkins> I actually like evil cadance's voice better than good cadance
<Bronysith> This shit reminds me of disney
<Anotherguy> I forgot how to type it
