<Trekkie2063> chat.....so....fast
<Doombah> So, I have a friend who works for Hasbro. They really wanted to make Celestia her actual color (light pink), but that color picks up dirt SO much more than the pink that they use. That's the only reason she's that color. Plus, pink ponies sell better than white ones. But, the main reason is the dirt factor.
<Artrageous> Would the stream be better without the chat? Is a separate server handling it?
<kdlfs> FGN is actually pretty good too

<a041744> You fools!
<InsertCupcake> People keep misspelling Candy Mane
<Scarlet_Pimponyl> I love cloths that are the same color as my skin. It looks like I'm wearing nothing at all.
<Guest_9001> Rainbow dash's new dress is...kinda cooler
<Kenzamaka> bitches you don't know what you want
<LunaTheForgotten> Damn it RainbowDash!
<Frosty> 0Fluttershy's version 2 dress is noticeably uglier in every way IMO.
<ValtheJean> it would be a pony overload of orgasmic size
<Luna> 07that would be kinda cool actually
<Newspony> poor rarity
<Scarlet_Pimponyl> Nothing at all
<EspyLacopa> I imagined mine would be cooler. What? She asked.
<Corwyn> That's when Rarity snapped your honor.
<Dashite> Need 70% average to stay in the program. I'm actually at 71.667
<dashie> dose ponies dosent have taste for clothes
<RainBroDash> 10>110%
<dracomouse> nice nice THARE PURFECT
<Stup1dg33kz> 0Frosty: Totally.
<RainbowSmash> And rainbow dash deserves to be the element of honesty
*Duke_Nukem 11gives Silvermane "someting"

<simpe94> oh rarity
<demonoid47> aka THER SHIT
<vraiment> Back when I saw this episode I thought all the 5 ponies acted a little bitchy
<Sumica> not sure if I could pulle that off =p
<Silvermane> lol
<Fluttershy> 9I'm not sure.... o-o
<Scarlet_Pimponyl> Problem, Rarity?
<scatr> (one of the few times that i've seen bronystate chat go too fast for me to keep up with)
<Thorinair> fluttershy is epic
<Blackwolfee> NOTHING AT ALL
<mib_5cdxb0> They need to be 20% cooler.
<scatr> (is now)
<mib_2tisms> Fluttershy is talking. Me gusta.
*Silvermane takes something from Duke_Nukem
<simpe94> it's no imposition
<Ghosties> 4But I'm positive I would feel completely exhausted by the end, and possibly sick
<Anonyponies> Awww. yeah. If this is the kind of quality to expect when Season 2 airs I am definitely making use of this site.
<ValtheJean> well, we could do a tradeoff between streamers
<scallywag> I keep losing the stream. And the low quality stream is just a Megas XLR clip :\
<simpe94> it is
<SlurryMoon> Rarity: Angry smile

<a041744> A DOLPHIN IS NOT A FISH!
<Dashite> It's one of the few programs at my uni that have a minimum average requirement like this.
<thunder-colt> so im excited i can watch live now
<Skoochniysmeshno> WE CAN REBUILD HIM

<Thorinair> thunder-colt: are you watching now?
<mvj> and samuel l jackson
<ValtheJean> where they'd watch the show from episode 1
<Parchment_Scroll> I am cannot waiting for new episodeings.
<Nouthriss> = next up - Dolphin Kidney?
<Nightshade> dolphin tale - I SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE
<thunder-colt> not right now
<Lixr> why are dolphins living in igloos?
<Silvermane> They kept a dolphin in a chlorine pool?
<ValtheJean> and end right at the new episode
<LunaTheForgotten> Germs FTW
<Duke_Nukem> 11Meaning someone went: "This is kinda cool, let me change everything that actually happened so that it's entertaining"
<GLaDOS> OG GOD NO
<mib_0g8xk3> And then that dolphin becomes a time traveler.
<Nashy> ads...
<Thorinair> do it :D
<Frosty> 0I find it refreshing that the ponies AREN'T super fluffy and perfect all t he time - they're all somewhat flawed at times, like people. Which makes them much more believable and loveable in the long run imo.
