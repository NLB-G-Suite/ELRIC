<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03also WTF?
<drfsupercenter> 03why do you have it stretched
<drfsupercenter> 03you should aspect scale it
<Espeon> 06lol vietnamese crystal
<Umbreon> 12i don't really care drf
<Umbreon> 12also my emulator did that, not me
<Umbreon> 12sorry drf
<Umbreon> 12had to call western technical college
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you tell the emulator to do x4 rather than fullscreen
<Umbreon> 12i applied for computer support tech, and they put me in computer support spec
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Umbreon> 12Espeon, i got my umbreon in the game :D

<drfsupercenter> 03I'm really sensitive to stretched out video LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03and images
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<Umbreon> 12pff
<HyperMetalLugia> U MAD
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone took the Mona Lisa
<HyperMetalLugia> Abd gnn
<drfsupercenter> 03and made her fatter by stretching her
<drfsupercenter> 03people would be mad
<HyperMetalLugia> *and hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03so :/
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Umbreon> 12drf
<Umbreon> 12i saw a movie where they set the mona lisa on fire
<Umbreon> 12on purpose
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03k?
<Umbreon> 12people would probably be mad as well if the authentic copy of the mona lisa was set on fire

<HyperMetalLugia> Well, hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03though
<Umbreon> 12http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/Pokemon_VietCristal.png?t=1303757033
<drfsupercenter> 03my house's upload speed is actually a little better than this one
<Umbreon> 12there drf, happy now?
<HyperMetalLugia> Take your PC home and profit?
<drfsupercenter> 03yep XD
<drfsupercenter> 03just set VBA to do x4 size
<Umbreon> 12then it doesn't take up the whole screen
<Umbreon> 12i'm kind of obsessive about this game taking up the whole screen D:
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here :(
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL why
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate fullscreen games
<Umbreon> 12i wish it'd just keep the ratio
<drfsupercenter> 03with two monitors it just gets annoying
<Umbreon> 12but black out the rest of the screen
<HyperMetalLugia> We need to use every pixel
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03doing that is stretching the pixels
<HyperMetalLugia> Well with other and bigger games (N64/PS1) that isn't as big as a problem
<Angel_Espeon> 13I misread monitors for monaters :<
*Angel_Espeon goes back to idling
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/aUvG6.png
<drfsupercenter> 03that's relatively big anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes it is
<HyperMetalLugia> But with GBA/GB and NES/SNES, it looks ugly
<drfsupercenter> 03they're still 4:3
<drfsupercenter> 03not 16:9
<Umbreon> 12i don't mean like full full screen
<Umbreon> 12but i mean like the original screenshot
<EpicStatsGuy> :–∑ / :–ó / :3 / :¬≥ / —î: / E: / :–≠ / –Ñ: / :—ç
<Umbreon> 12maximize
<Umbreon> 12d
*HyperMetalLugia trolls DRF by putting Pokemon Red in the Gameboy player on an 52in TV, putting it on Fullscreen then zooming it in to get the game to fill up every pixel
<HyperMetalLugia> And that's how I play Crystal version :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I kinda don't get why
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks horrible
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, but I don't care as I can see everything xD
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/aUvG6.png <- how can you not see everything there
<HyperMetalLugia> Pics are blocked, I'll look at them later XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Or in 10 mins
<Umbreon> 12yay finally caught a water pokemon
<Umbreon> 12drf
<Umbreon> 12what looks horrible is playing a DS game on the 3DS
<Umbreon> 12that's when i draw the line
<Umbreon> 12and i can't stand shrinking it either
<HyperMetalLugia> x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03Umbreon, stretching on VBA is like 4x worse
<drfsupercenter> 03than a DS game on the 3dS
<drfsupercenter> 03and at least on the 3DS
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't lose aspect
<drfsupercenter> 03aspect-scaling is fine
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what the 3DS does
<drfsupercenter> 03not very well, but it's bgetter than stretching
<drfsupercenter> 03-g
<HyperMetalLugia> At least the DSi XL does it pretty well :P
<drfsupercenter> 03that's because the DSi XL doesn't scale
<drfsupercenter> 03it just has the same resolution as the DS
<HyperMetalLugia> But it's the same res and all, jut big pixels XD
<HyperMetalLugia> *just
<HyperMetalLugia> ABOUT TIME, you lazy espeon

<Umbreon> 12it's a matter of opinion drf
<Aristeo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXHUdvvHTkw
<drfsupercenter> 03no, it's scientific, what the 3DS does is a lot more minor than what VBA does
<Umbreon> 12LOL
<Umbreon> 12i forgot about the gameboy printer
<drfsupercenter> 03stretching 192 pixels to 240 is like what
<drfsupercenter> 0320%?
<drfsupercenter> 03Stretching 128 or so pixels to like 800
<drfsupercenter> 03is a lot more
<Umbreon> 12but the 3DS does a horrible job of it
<Umbreon> 12it actually is noticeable XD
<drfsupercenter> 03emulator stretching is really noticeable to me too
<Umbreon> 12it's not to me
<Umbreon> 12makes it easier to read

<Umbreon> 12but that's probably youtubes doing
<drfsupercenter> 03well Umbreon, that's because it's not true pixel for pixel
<drfsupercenter> 03well that too
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like
<drfsupercenter> 03enlarging the game like the 3DS does
<drfsupercenter> 03then downscaling it again
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks bad
<drfsupercenter> 03not AS bad but yeah
<Umbreon> 12it's a matter of opinion dude :P
<Umbreon> 12some people like bad quality over screen size
<Aristeo> Neon: but how so?
<Umbreon> 12like bad quality large screen size over small little screen size
<HyperMetalLugia> Depends, I hate pixelated movies/images but games are fine :P
<Neon> NATO authorized war planes to assassinate him via air strike, but he's unharmed.
<HyperMetalLugia> But that's why we should all use SVGs/Vectors, never get that issue (even though complex images are hard to make, sorta)
<drfsupercenter> 03well HML
<drfsupercenter> 03have you ever tried playing Kitten Cannon in widescreen?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes it's vectors, but it's messed up as the object physics were designed for 4:3
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<HyperMetalLugia> Lololol, well why not the nice anamorphic?
<HyperMetalLugia> But anyway, pokemon shouldn't have an issue
<HyperMetalLugia> And I misread that, so yeaah, it'll look off
<HyperMetalLugia> Blah, this isn't working

<drfsupercenter> 03"Call a friend. Your voice will bring a smile"
<Sally> dont think ive had roast pork
<drfsupercenter> 03that or it'll scare them away
<VampirePrincess> we just it roast i think.
<Cat> i prefer roast beef
<Cat> or duck
<Cat> :D
<VampirePrincess> actually i think beef is our just "roast"
<Cat> roast potatoes!
<Cat> and yorkshire pudding!
<Sally> <...<
<Cat> and gravy!
<Cat> :D
<Sally> what is yorkshire pudding?
<Cat> it's like batter
<Cat> but in the shape of a cup
<Cat> sort of
<Sally> hmm
<Cat> look up pictures!
<Sally> o.O wait wawt?
<Sally> how can batter be in the shape of a cup?
<Sally> tht'd make it a little... unsafe to eat.. wldnt it?
<VampirePrincess> lol
<Cat> yorkshire pudding: http://assets.mydish.co.uk/interface/members/241623/200982112572954-364208-26843-114006.jpg
<Cat> larger ones are sometimes used by filling them full of gravy and putting the meat inside them
<VampirePrincess> tht looks nothing like pudding.
<Cat> I guess it's kinda like a muffin
<Cat> lots of things are called a pudding in the UK
<Cat> what with our silly language
<Jason> hahah
<Cat> I mean, a black pudding is really a type of sausage
<Cat> :P
<VampirePrincess> ... thats so confusing.
<Cat> well, it's a blood sausage
<VampirePrincess> black pudding sounds more like chocolate pudding.
<Cat> generally sliced and fried with a full breakfast
<Cat> black pudding is black/dark brown in colour
<VampirePrincess> dark chocolate. yum breakfast. ^.^
<Aristeo> Sally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Sally> so rude
<VampirePrincess> haha, mine acts like i'm his freaking waitress.
<VampirePrincess> spoiled lil....
<Sally> pffftt
<Sally> If my bro was like that, he would get a swift kick to the nuts.
<VampirePrincess> if mine wasnt built like a ton of bricks and hadnt used his muscles b4... then maybe. but he's stout and bosy and not afraid to hit.
<VampirePrincess> and i bruise easy.
<Sally> lol same :P
<VampirePrincess> my brother can lay someone out that ia twice his size. :/
<Cat> I'm not a nasty bro to my sister
<Cat> but I'm not very strong either :P
*Sally hugs Cat :P
<Sally> my bro is just blehness
<VampirePrincess> my brother scares me. when he's mad.
<Cat> my sister is probably stronger than I am
<DarkTruth> :X
<Cat> considering she does horseriding and I do computers
<Sally> One time he pushed me for noooo reason so i kicked them then he tackled me then i punched then he through me then i bit him and got in trouble >:|
<Sally> him*
<Aristeo> D:
<Sally> :O only cuz he had evidence of said bite v_v
<Cat> I have hit my sister once
<Sally> was it for a good reason :o?
<Cat> and that was because she was sat next to me poking me and making stupid noises while I was stressed trying to repair a computer
<Sally> well there ya go
<Sally> she asked for it
<Cat> and she wouldnt go away no matter how much I told her to
<Cat> so I kicked her in the head
<Sally> xD
<Cat> she then snapped my phone in half, threw the bits at my head and stuffed my schoolbag in the toilet
<Cat> she was made to buy me a new, much better phone
<Cat> :P
<VampirePrincess> ....
<Sally> x) oh wow
<VampirePrincess> hmm suddenly my brother looks like an angel.
<Sally> lolz
<Sally> Cat, are you the oldest?
<DarkTruth> lol Cat
<Aristeo> :3

<Jason> and I can mod a lighter so that it shoots out lighter fluid
<Aristeo> mew
<Jason> and then you can put it into a cup and it will go up in flames
<Jason> Aristeo: If you set a person limit in a channel, does that include chanserv?

<Jason> D:
<Jason> is there anyone smart here?

<Jason> D:
<Spyrorocks`> python isnt exactly a standard language that everyone knows.
<Jason> damn

<Cat> the most commonly known "proper" languages are probably Java or C/C++

<Jason> hmm

*Jason knows HTML
<Jason> :D
<Cat> HTML isn't a programming language :P

<Cat> remarkably easy, too
*Jason is dumb
<Cat> although it's useless without some CSS as well
<Cat> far as I'm concerned
<Jason> damnit, do you have to go to freenode to find some smart people around here?

<EpicStatsGuy> Persona, Fursona...what do you call a dragon then?
<Jason> wait, what do you mean, Aristeo
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<HyperMetalLugia> Are we the only country in the world to NOT celebrate easter monday properly?
<Neon> Not you, dear. Go back to making cookies.
<Creideiki> HyperMetalLugia: Printers are only dangerous if: 1. It's from the 60s. ("What's this chain do? ARRRGHHHH--" "...And that's why your financial reports are coated in blood.") 2. Made in China. ("Print!" *whiizzz brrrr* ... *BOOM*) 3. Made by Aperture.
<Light_Latias> lol
<Aristeo> I mean, I buy something, there's my name on a credit card report
<Jason> oh, no
<Jason> Its all done secretly
<Jason> You send me $ on paypal
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes Credit, that is why we should watch out :P\
<Jason> I will pay for the seedbox
<HyperMetalLugia> Including the ink spills
<Jason> and it will be under a fake name
<Jason> and you will get to access it
<HyperMetalLugia> Save the papers, not the seals :P
<Umbreon> 12who here uses virtualboyadvance?
<Creideiki> The funny thing is? Printer ink is more expensive then drugs. :P
<Light_Latias> ...and its not over ><;;;

<Jason> and you get fill root access (its a vps)

<Creideiki> "You know how drug cartels could make more money? ...Replace the drugs with printer ink and toner and they'll be richer then Bill Gates!"
<Jason> idk what its called
<Creideiki> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> and it'll be legal XD
<Creideiki> Until someone finds a way to get high on toner. :P
<Jason> Oh, and you get a SolusVM VPS control panel, so you can track your usage
<HyperMetalLugia> That will happen, just like with markers and aerosoles
<HyperMetalLugia> And solder, well for me that is

<Aristeo> As long as your not violating someone's trademark, copyright, patent, revealing a trade secret, or violating a contract, you're all good
<Spyrorocks`> is it illegal to sell something though that can be used for those purposes
<Umbreon> 12lol

<nickstr> I HATED the Gameboy Color at first
<Aristeo> But only with The Pirate Bay
<HyperMetalLugia> I LOVED it XD
<HyperMetalLugia> It was like, my first real gameboy
<nickstr> washed out colors, very dim screen, cramped buttons
<Aristeo> It's gray grounds, I haven't seen much case law about assisting in copyright infringement, especially in Canada, and I monitor that stuff carefully
<Umbreon> 12HyperMetalLugia
<Umbreon> 12i choose pikachu as your starter
<HyperMetalLugia> ......FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<HyperMetalLugia> How could I forget
<HyperMetalLugia> That shows how long it's been since I played Yellow
<nickstr> I prefered my Game Gear over that for a long time
<HyperMetalLugia> I didn't like any of the GG games XD
<Umbreon> 12still haven't gotten any calls
<Umbreon> 12where are those 3
<Aristeo> As long as there's some legal use for those things, and you make it clear through BS that what you're selling is intended only for that purpose, then you should be good
<nickstr> it was far more comfortable to play, the screen was easier to see, plus more colorful
<Aristeo> The only people I've seen charged with assisting are large torrent sites
<nickstr> I mean, the Gameboy Color would have been better if it just had A FREAKING BACKLIGHT
<nickstr> none of this pasive ilumination BS
<TTEchidna> WHERE IS
<TTEchidna> THE MAN IN CHARGEY
<TTEchidna> BECAUSE I NEED
<HyperMetalLugia> Umbreon, DirectDraw or Direct 3D?
<TTEchidna> something to be turned on
<HyperMetalLugia> I perfer DirectDraw lol
<Umbreon> 12huh?
<HyperMetalLugia> Slightly more blurry, but fine
<Umbreon> 12i dunno
<HyperMetalLugia> Under Options and video
<HyperMetalLugia> Try it out on fullscreen
<HyperMetalLugia> (render method)
<Umbreon> 12doesn't matter to me
<nickstr> emulation on the PSP is today a very good compromise
<Icydragon3D> 12O_o

<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<drfsupercenter> 03the computer is all set up, just no speakers right now
<drfsupercenter> 03for the simple reason that I need to figure out where to put said speakers
<drfsupercenter> 03my bedroom is not quite suitable for surround sound - while *I* could easily install it, my parents would kick me out of the house LO
<drfsupercenter> 03L:L
<drfsupercenter> 03*LOL>
<nickstr> mine don't mind me having a stereo in here
<Light_Latias> Danny~
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I got home, right
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF being disowned
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm unpacking
<drfsupercenter> 03I have the radio on
<drfsupercenter> 03my parents are like "You're home! Turn it down"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like wow, that didn't even take 30 seconds
<prince-dari> I think it started as a meme.
<HyperMetalLugia> They don't miss you at all
<drfsupercenter> 03I heard some new songs on FM radio that I didn't know about
<drfsupercenter> 03seeing as how I didn't have a radio at home
<prince-dari> Then loads of /b/tards actually liked the show, lol.
<nickstr> and believe me the stereo I have could rattle the windows
<prince-dari> So they made ponychan.
<nickstr> meh FM
<drfsupercenter> 03so can mine if I turn it up all the way
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<nickstr> enjoy your multipath and distortion
<drfsupercenter> 03my stereo does AM too but nothing good to tune it to :P
<Icydragon3D> 12Those sick... god....
<nickstr> you mean no rap where it all consists of "F this F that and F you"
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03hey now
<drfsupercenter> 03some of the new songs I heard were pop
<drfsupercenter> 03actual singing :PO
<drfsupercenter> 03-O
<HyperMetalLugia> Amazing, actual singing for once
<prince-dari> I think Neon was gunna go troll them.
<nickstr> but top 40 radio is in such sad shape these days that its rare
<nickstr> adult contemporary is where its at
<Icydragon3D> 12If he needs help tell him I'm free ;3
<prince-dari> Haha, ok.
<HyperMetalLugia> Adult music amrite ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> Seduction tunes ;3

<HyperMetalLugia> Pft, no thanks
<nickstr> KXXO 96.1
<Icydragon3D> 12I'm a furry guiz >;3
<nickstr> along with countless others
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not top 40, is the thing
<drfsupercenter> 03it's "any music with a beat"
<drfsupercenter> 03which I like :)P
<drfsupercenter> 03*:P
<prince-dari> Good for you.
<HyperMetalLugia> Lv6 Pikachu vs lv 190 Articuno
<Icydragon3D> 12;D
<HyperMetalLugia> This won't end well
<nickstr> it seems like rap and top 40 just blends together
<nickstr> possibly because it does
<Icydragon3D> 12Anywho, where are the girls?I'm tired of all these men
<drfsupercenter> 03rap is one part of top 40
<drfsupercenter> 03but not all of it
<prince-dari> They're probably hiding from you.
<nickstr> from what I heard its the bulk of it
<Icydragon3D> 12They always do, till I get them in my room
<nickstr> we have a top 40 station out of Seattle owned by "The Evil Empire" but I don't listen to it at all
<drfsupercenter> 03Clear Channel;?
<Icydragon3D> 12Cuz my room is so nice and fluffy
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> the smaller ones I find far more interesting
<nickstr> but I have a large choice for FM
<nickstr> thanks to this

<nickstr> that is the main antenna I have for FM
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Big thing
<nickstr> rated up to 120 miles
<nickstr> but that is a conservative estimate
<nickstr> I have had up to 150 miles
<`> Night
<HyperMetalLugia> So NickStr is going to do the Team Rocket and take over all the radio?
<nickstr> no
<nickstr> that is for receive only
<Umbreon> 12finally one of them called
<Umbreon> 12i got the water stone and a vaporeon
<Umbreon> 12all that is left is a thunder stone for jolteon
<nickstr> a Sangean HD Radio tuner popped up on eBay
<nickstr> http://cgi.ebay.com/Sangean-HDT-1X-/290559526100?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item43a6b284d4
<nickstr> I suspect this uses a common chipset in comparison to mine
<nickstr> plus drf, you might like it
<nickstr> This is a HD radio tuner with high audio quality digital optical output.
<nickstr> I spoke too soon when I said none existed
<drfsupercenter> 03my Insignia does optical out too
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's recompressed so it's not really worth it
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow

<Drake> 04WAIT
<Drake> 04Actually
<Espeon> 06obvi- what
<Armageddon> with his sarcasm
<Drake> 04I shouldn't make that joke
<Armageddon> rofl
<Drake> 04It's cause more flame wars
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04It'd
<Armageddon> hm
<Armageddon> Captain Bronwyn...
<Armageddon> and Cathy
<Armageddon> also
<Armageddon> lol
<Armageddon> Rex, Cathy and Leonard are pretty much the only normal names
<Armageddon> in the entire thing
<Espeon> 06You do enjoy your strange names afterall.
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> Cathy was from the original dream that inspired the fic
<Drake> 04Lyon. Radiel. Calasi. Dyan. Raylene.
<Armageddon> so I kept the name
<Drake> 04Why does the odd name award go to her?
<Espeon> 06Drake those names sound like
<Armageddon> Xale. Seiranyu. Seran. Ralexinor. Seraph. Diablos. [insert random name here].
<Espeon> 06alright it's a tie
<Espeon> 06I guess
<Espeon> 06yayxale
<Espeon> 06!!!
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> I had some more
<Drake> 04xd
<Armageddon> Calasi is strange as fuck though
<Armageddon> oh yeah
<Armageddon> Draconis
<Armageddon> but that's coming from me
<Drake> 04Victor. Irres. Scientia. Morva. Rena.
<Armageddon> who has Seiranyu and Ralexinor
<Armageddon> and also Kommander Kulesz and The Hensh
<Armageddon> >mfw
<Drake> 04Who has Irres.
<Armageddon> as well as Syril/Syril/Synix
<Drake> 04I doubt anyone knows Irres has a story behind his name.
<Armageddon> and Rathicus
<Armageddon> and Dragoran
<Armageddon> and Merigal
*Espeon amount of characters can be counted on one hand-master race
<Armageddon> and shit
*Espeon dies
<Armageddon> rofl
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> but Xeli
<Armageddon> Leonard is awesome
<Armageddon> I love your character
<Espeon> 06oh the images
<Armageddon> x_X
<Espeon> 06But that is good
<Armageddon> somehow
<Armageddon> I attribute Rex and Leo to being almost brothers
<Espeon> 06it's like an extreme exeggeration of my own traits irl for comedy and win purposes
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> and then it's automatic Seir/Seran x Lyon
<Armageddon> and you know what
<Armageddon> yesterday I realised in the second chapter/First Mission
<Armageddon> I typed Drake instead of Lyon for the first half of the story
<Armageddon> go read it again
<Armageddon> you'll see it
<Armageddon> and then I was "OH FUCK"
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> seriously
<Armageddon> I need to fix it
<Armageddon> but lazy and I can't edit TST's
<Armageddon> oh Xeli
<Drake> 04But seriously.
<Drake> 04I'm nowhere near as stupid as your portray me.
<Armageddon> can you do me a favour and delete the Reminiscence topic on TST or at least remove the author's notes?
<Drake> 04At least not anymore.
<Armageddon> rofl
<Armageddon> Lyon is a lot smarter than he was
<Armageddon> with seir
<Armageddon> seir probably had that "make everyone around me stupid" machine
<Espeon> 06Should I just delete all of it?
<Armageddon> it's up to you Xeli
<Armageddon> I'll repost it
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> I just want the ANs gone
<Espeon> 06I'll just remove everything then. 'tis tidier :3
<Armageddon> derp XD
<Armageddon> I can do HoR's fine
<Armageddon> as I still have my account lol
<Espeon> 06Now you can commence the copypasta
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> Drake
<Armageddon> did I ever tell you LL's storyline?
<Drake> 04?
<Drake> 04yup
<Armageddon> derp
<Drake> 04Though I forget the details
<Armageddon> I like the storyline
<Armageddon> do you know Seran's Story's one?
<Drake> 04Isn't just how Seir turned bad?
<Drake> 04If so, then yes.
<Drake> 04well
<Drake> 04not 'bad'
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> just went over to TD
<Armageddon> being Kommander Kulesz is a meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeanie
<Armageddon> because*
<Armageddon> not being
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> >typos
<Armageddon> also
<Armageddon> Let's plot the mercenary shit.
<Armageddon> GATHER 'ROUND, XELI, DRAKE.
<Drake> 04RIGHT
<Armageddon> LET'S TALK IN SECRET.
<Drake> 04I have 30 minutes- and hour
<Armageddon> NO ONE CAN HEAR THIS, AMIRITE.
<Drake> 04roughly
<Armageddon> I have...I don't know.
<Armageddon> I'll be leaving soon
<Armageddon> but let's start zomg plotting
<Armageddon> okay so
<Armageddon> we start with you and Xeli in an apartment
<Armageddon> and then I run in
<Armageddon> and shout "SEX"
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> and then we do that
<Drake> 04And it begins again
<Armageddon> :D
<Armageddon> and then
<Armageddon> people notice us
<Armageddon> call the police
<Armageddon> and our asses get hauled over
<Armageddon> to the mercenary center
<Armageddon> where we learn how to have sex properly
<Armageddon> with protection
<Espeon> 06come back
<Espeon> 06see thi
<Espeon> 06wow
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> I'm low on sugagr again
<Armageddon> -g
<Armageddon> or high
<Armageddon> I don't know
<Armageddon> one of them
<Armageddon> anyway
<Drake> 04You weren't high/low 20 minutes ago
<Armageddon> Xeli gets a sledgehammer for banging penises
<Espeon> 06ouch
<Armageddon> and Drake
<Armageddon> hm
<Espeon> 06you're a girl you're not allowed to speak of such because you don't feel the pain in your mind
<Armageddon> you get a needle
<Armageddon> for raping little girls with
<Armageddon> and then
<Drake> 04what
<Espeon> 06Have a seat
<Drake> 04my
<Drake> 04I second Xeli's statement.
<Armageddon> I get a taser
<Armageddon> to stick up people's butts
<Armageddon> for buttsex
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> I think Drake got me high
<Armageddon> he always gets me high
<Armageddon> x_X
<Drake> 04I have that effect on people
<Espeon> 06We need to get some elephant tranquilizers or something in here to use on her when this happens
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Agreed.
<Armageddon> I think the solution
<Drake> 04While it is amusing, it gets disturbing after a while.
<Armageddon> would be for Drake to leave temporarily
<Armageddon> idk
<Armageddon> anyway
<Armageddon> let's get back on topic
<Armageddon> how should we start it, Drake?
<Drake> 04First things first - names
<Armageddon> do we know/not know either other? I'll assume the latter
<Armageddon> okay
<Armageddon> I'm your sister
<Armageddon> pleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease?
<Drake> 04Noooooooo
<Armageddon> D:
<Armageddon> fine
<Drake> 04I had other...ideas.

<Armageddon> I'll be your brother
<Armageddon> happy?
<Drake> 04no
<Drake> 04that's
<Drake> 04that's worse
<Espeon> 06Anything that gives you a penis is not acceptable
<Armageddon> T_T
<Armageddon> fuck, Xeli
<Armageddon> that was my lifelong dream
<Armageddon> you ruined it
<Armageddon> >:(
<Drake> 04XD

<Espeon> 06but either way
<Armageddon> anyway
<Drake> 04Well NS
<Espeon> 06use lock-on on the topic
<Armageddon> yeah that
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> I can be called Seran...?
<Drake> 04If you're my sister that'll help get rid of all that UST that is bound to come up if you're not.
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04If you know what UST is.
<Armageddon> not really
<Armageddon> universal sex desire?
<Armageddon> desire starts with t
<Armageddon> I think
<Armageddon> anyway
<Armageddon> that's beside the point
<Armageddon> NAMES PLZ
<Drake> 04Unresolved Sexual Tension

<Armageddon> okay
<Armageddon> 2034 I can handle
<Drake> 04hurr durr
<Armageddon> I like the number
<Drake> 042034
<Armageddon> 2069
<Armageddon> plz
<Armageddon> ANYWAY
<Drake> 04seriously
<Drake> 04Too early>
<Drake> 04?*
<Armageddon> no Drake, let's make it 2500
<Drake> 04WW 21 and 2 happened within half a century of each other.
<Armageddon> so we have awesome technology and shit
<Drake> 04But then I'
<Armageddon> WW 21 and 2
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04I'd have to use a railgun as a sniper rifle.
<Armageddon> xD
<Drake> 04That's no fun because there's no recoil.
<Armageddon> x_X
<Armageddon> fine
<Drake> 04and plasma is overused.
<Armageddon> well then
<Armageddon> I like plasma
<Armageddon> I want a fucking plasma sword/blade
<Armageddon> like a damn lightsaber hurr durr
<Espeon> 06better stock up on batteries
<Drake> 042062 then
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> rofl
<Armageddon> 2069
<Armageddon> >:(
<Drake> 04fine
<Armageddon> yay
<Armageddon> okay then
<Armageddon> but hm
<Armageddon> Drake, if you're the sniper
<Armageddon> what is Xeli? the other sniper/madman?
<Drake> 04Xeli is the heavy weapons man.
<Drake> 04With a gun called Sasha.
*Drake hides
<Armageddon> rofl
<Armageddon> his "friends"
*Armageddon hides
<Drake> 04No, I'm not actually sure what his role was going to be.
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04You'd be the tech specialist.
<Armageddon> and person who stabs people in the butt
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Ok
<Armageddon> with a plasma sword
<Armageddon> typically I don't like ranged weapons anyway
<Drake> 04You are the tech specialist and close quarters combat specialist.
<Espeon> 06Well sure, we have the spy/engineer and the sniper
<Armageddon> okay :D
<Espeon> 06spy in the sense of stabbing people in the butt at least
<Armageddon> rofl
<Armageddon> xeli can be the stealth clown
*Armageddon hides
<Espeon> 06I'm not Robert Bowling and I'd rather wax my privates.
<Armageddon> xD
<Drake> 04I'm the marksman and saboteur.
<Espeon> 06I guess what's needed IS support afterall
<Armageddon> I'm the techfag and close combat derpist.
<Armageddon> Xeli should be all-rounded
<Drake> 04Xeli can maybe be the demolitions expert, espionage specialist and the all-rounder.
<Armageddon> rofl espionage
<Espeon> 06must resist overly obvious pun
<Armageddon> lololol
<Drake> 04NS unlocks doors, Xeli gets me past the guards, and I sabotage the mehcanics while Xeli uses explosive charges to cover our exit and NS wipes the floor with anyone who gets in our way.
<Drake> 04Don't get it.
<Drake> 04Or I could just cover both of you with the rifle.
<Armageddon> first one
<Armageddon> I LIKE THIS.
<Drake> 04XD
<Espeon> 06That sounds rather dynamic and the combination of sneaky and blowing things up sounds perfectly illogical
<Espeon> 06I like this
<Espeon> 06:3
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> lolol
<Espeon> 06But that is quite interesting and would probably mean some kind of all-roundedness
<Armageddon> yeah, but I'll still suck at aim
<Espeon> 06but lets go with that formula
<Drake> 04Xeli
<Armageddon> so therefore I stay away from guns because everyone else is in danger of being shot
<Drake> 04what do you reckon you'd do well at then?
<Armageddon> Drake
<Armageddon> i know
<Armageddon> protecting the world from devastation
<Drake> 04?
<Drake> 04LOL
*Armageddon hides
<Armageddon> TEAM ROCKET HURR DURR
<Armageddon> ...lol us as Team Rocket
<Armageddon> ...LOL MENTAL IMAGES
<Armageddon> me as some form of Jessie
<Armageddon> you as some form of James
<Armageddon> and Xeli as an espeon instead of meowth
<Armageddon> that would be Epic
<Drake> 04awesome
<Drake> 04anyway
<Armageddon> "Nightshadow!"
<Drake> 04back to the topic
<Armageddon> "Drake!"
<Armageddon> "Espeon, that's right!"
<Armageddon> oh man x-X
<Espeon> 06o3o
<Espeon> 06either way
<Espeon> 06From what Drake said it sounded like I'm some kind of solid snake/demoman lovechild or something
<Espeon> 06Espeon, dat's right
<Espeon> 06A clear improvement
<Armageddon> welll I need to brb
<Armageddon> woah Xeli, lag
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04demomand lovechild.
<Armageddon> lololol
<Drake> 04demoman*
<Drake> 04brings to mind
<Drake> 04a video I saw.
<Drake> 04mymind
<Drake> 04itburnsfromthememories
<Armageddon> x_________x
<Armageddon> butt hurr
<Armageddon> .
<Armageddon> but*
<Armageddon> we have some things fingered out!
<Armageddon> ...
<Armageddon> finger
<Drake> 04...
<Armageddon> finguer
<Drake> 04hahaha
<Armageddon> figured*
<Drake> 04ahahahahahahahhaa
<Armageddon> fuck
<Armageddon> shut up you >:(
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04that typo
<Drake> 04was the most epic typo ever
<Armageddon> x_X
<Espeon> 06But it's rather amuwhat
<Armageddon> I type it too much
<Espeon> 06that's up there with bumphump
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Anyway.
<Drake> 04Xeli could be the weapon specialist.
<Drake> 04or something.
<Drake> 04I always saw you as the muscle of the group.
<Espeon> 06hahaha oh what
<Armageddon> ...lol
<Espeon> 06but for the sake of the story sure
<Armageddon> Xeli like chuck norris
<Armageddon> ohgodmymind
<Espeon> 06nope
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> or well
<Armageddon> I accidentally brought up
<Armageddon> the reminiscence openoffice window
<Armageddon> and then though
<Armageddon> thought*
<Armageddon> "Xeli as The Hensh"
<Armageddon> OFU
<Drake> 04LOL
<Espeon> 06Not sure if want
<Armageddon> even worse
<Armageddon> if Drake was The Hensh
<Drake> 04...
<Armageddon> then it'd be Seran x The Hensh
<Drake> 04ohgod
<Armageddon> as it's technically Drake x me here
<Armageddon> and then...
<Drake> 04mymind
<Armageddon> >mindfuck
<Armageddon> xD
<Drake> 04whathaveyoudone
<Armageddon> ohnofuckiblewuptheinternet
<Armageddon> ...lol
<Armageddon> I read that as "oh no fuckible up the internet"
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> my mind
<Armageddon> is obviously in a state of distress
<Armageddon> anyway
<Armageddon> I should go
<Armageddon> will be back around 10:30pm - 11:pm
<Armageddon> 00
<Armageddon> 11:00pm
<Drake> 04I won't be here
<Espeon> 06And now I will never look at team rocket the same way again
<Espeon> 06And D:
<Armageddon> rofl Xeli
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> oh god
*Drake hugs NS
<Armageddon> another image
<Drake> 04I'll have to see you tomorrow.

<Armageddon> mind = blown
*Armageddon hugs Drake back
<Armageddon> yeah see you tomorrow too then

<Espeon> 06Well both that and I have no idea what I would come up with otherwise
<Drake> 04Fair enough then XD

<Jason> me too!
<Jason> what if your battery is dead
<Jason> and what if the lightning hit your satelite electricity too, huh?
<Jason> thought so.
<Charles> hmm
<Charles> well, in that case I would have to use my netbook
<Jason> D:
<Charles> or, just my phone
<Jason> D:<
<Charles> or better yet, start my car and plug my main comp into that
<Jason> What if I cut all the wires in your house and stabbed your phone, netbook, and computer?
<Charles> hmm, then you would be dead before you got to the end of my driveway
*Charles cocks his .22 rifle
<Charles> lol
<Jason> I already stabbed everything

<Cat> sleeeeeeeeeeeep
<Ray||Osu> 02Semi-idle, need to get hardcore
<VampirePrincess> hiya cat
<VampirePrincess> :)
*Cat lies down on the floor and curls up, completely out of energy
*VampirePrincess scatches cat's ears
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> AE!
*lightumbreon|LightLugia attacks huggles
*Jason eats the Cat
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Ray||Osu> 02Angel~
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> i'm working on this HUGE picture right now
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> it contains 4 characters, and total time is now around 04:47 Hours
<VampirePrincess> awww why'd you do that jay? i like cats. :(
<Jason> D:
<Jason> TOO BAD!
<Jason> nomnom
<Ray||Osu> 02+0.7% acc <3333
<Ray||Osu> 02Yesz
*VampirePrincess protects the cat
<Cat> I saw my cat eat a rabbit
<Cat> today
<Charles> ah christ, I think I lost my nevermind\
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> nice
<Charles> found it
<VampirePrincess> ???
<Charles> was gonna say I lost my copy of Empire at War, but it was sitting right next to me
<VampirePrincess> lol
<Charles> :3
*VampirePrincess is having poptarts for lunch again. :/
<VampirePrincess> smores flavor today.
<Charles> :D spread peanut butter on em!
<Charles> or jelly
<VampirePrincess> not at home.
<Charles> jelly is good :D
<VampirePrincess> cant
<Charles> oh
<VampirePrincess> lol
*Charles contemplates trying to defy logic and shove a jar of jelly through his screen to VampirePrincess
*VampirePrincess gives Charles a poptart
<VampirePrincess> lololol
<HyperMetalLugia> There..
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm o.o
<Charles> :D
*VampirePrincess nominates Charles as leader of da zombies
*Cat remains as Captain Awesome
<Cat> :3
<VampirePrincess> of course cat. :)
<VampirePrincess> Charles: we picked leaders of stuff yesterday...
<Charles> oh :D
<VampirePrincess> i lead the vamps, with jay as my 2nd
<VampirePrincess> cat leads music.
<Charles> hmm, but can Zombies even be led?
<VampirePrincess> lol, ur the zombie expert. can they?
<Jason> Yes!
<Charles> not really. Psuedo Zombies, yes, but not true zombies
<VampirePrincess> idk, u cud lead them to places with boomer bile.
<VampirePrincess> lol
<Cat> depends on what kind of zombies they are I guess
*VampirePrincess nods
<Cat> you could lead most zombies with a hunk of meat on a stick
<Charles> yes, but those are Psuedo zombies, the infected in L4D
<VampirePrincess> oh.
<Charles> hmm, but would they be following the meat, or would they be following you?
<VampirePrincess> RUN, its not the meat they're after!
<VampirePrincess> lolol
<Charles> and I am not sure they would go after dead meat. in many zombie movies, whenever you see the survivors in a grocery store, aside from the general looted nature of the place, the meats do not look like they were picked over by the undead
<Michel> hallo!
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> eyo
<VampirePrincess> well, at least if zombies ever did take over, no one would starve.
<VampirePrincess> so who will lead the werewolves? shapeshifter? werecats?
<VampirePrincess> magicians?
<VampirePrincess> i must apologize, been reading too much fiction as of late... :)
<VampirePrincess> elves? dwarves? dragons?
<VampirePrincess> ah but the list seems endless.
<VampirePrincess> and i love it!
<VampirePrincess> :D
<Charles> :D
<Charles> I has caffeine, o I should perk up soon
<Charles> mmmmm, 30TB of storage
<Charles> do want
<VampirePrincess> okaaaaay...
*VampirePrincess blinks with apparent lack of knowlegde
<VampirePrincess> :)
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai
<VampirePrincess> hey Charles do you know if they ever made the sequel movie to eragon? the book was called eldest, but i never heard if it came out as a movie like eragon did.
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Mice
<Charles> I doubt it
<VampirePrincess> didnt think so either...
<VampirePrincess> they sucked eragon up bad.
<VampirePrincess> the book was soooooooo much better
<Charles> first few google results seem to indicate that since the first movie was screwed up so badly, they could not possibly make the sequel
<Charles> ...
<Charles> apparently my Zune has Cyrus on it
<VampirePrincess> huh?
<Charles> that "I hop of the plane at LAX" song
<Charles> Party in The USA
<VampirePrincess> oh... i take it zune is a music player?
<Charles> it was Microsofts answer to the iPod
<VampirePrincess> ooooooh.
*VampirePrincess has an iPod
<Charles> it is a wonderful device line, even the first gen was of better quality than the iPod original, and is typically regarded as having better sound quality than the iPod, and also has a better software interface
<VampirePrincess> i wouldnt know. i've had my 4GB iPod nano since X-mas when i was 15. 4yrs now. :)
<Charles> that's good that it lasted so long
<VampirePrincess> dont jinx it!!!!! lol.
<VampirePrincess> my dad's borrowing it now. its full of rock music. acdc, godsmack, etc.
*VampirePrincess has a bruise that is a lil under half the length of her arm.

<Umbreon> 12every emulator i come across only has autofire for A and B

<drf|laptop> 03why would you ?
<Umbreon> 12i want to force my character to run for eternity into a repeating pattern so i can level up a pokemon in the day care
<Umbreon> 12i cant seem to well you know
<Umbreon> 12find any gameshark cheats that work for the game, i guess for some reason since it's from a different region the english gameshark codes don't work
<drf|laptop> 03of course they don't, the codes are country-specific
<drf|laptop> 03as for the pattern, you don't just need autofire then, you need a macro
<drf|laptop> 03I got a solution for you though
<drf|laptop> 03use the on-screen keyboard and Autoclicker
<drf|laptop> 03have it click on the arrow keys
<drf|laptop> 03in whatever pattern you want
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Umbreon> 12but i want to do other things while it's working

<Ascendant> derp
*lightumbreon sights
<lightumbreon> ok, i'm off for school now, if i come back, and they spammed again, i'll let you know
<Ascendant> [15:43:16] `-ocean.lugia.us (261) 2
<Ascendant> x_X
<Draelen> Ocean can handle up to 2000 users without a sweat ;p
<Kyu> 07right
<Kyu> 07so
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Umbreon> 12!kyu
<Draelen> thats not very helpful, at least paste what they are being spammed by
<Ascendant> going to set that
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Kyu02)03WB* - <Kyu> 07you all suck XD
<Ascendant> wb
<Kyu> 07that'll quiet things down lol
<Ascendant> o-o?
<Draelen> Kyu, that mode is to recdirect bots to another channel
<Kyu> 07i know
<Draelen> you removed it ;p
<Kyu> 07but I got rid of my ircop
<Ascendant> you could just /umode2 -so
<Draelen> Ah, so you could join
<Draelen> I see
<Ascendant> sec
<Ascendant> come on BOPM
<Ascendant> join
<Kyu> 07and the stream of bots joining was kinda annoying since I dunno what to do about it =P
<Draelen> Alright, running script now
<Draelen> hope everyone is joined to at least one channel
<Ascendant> uh
<eXAKR> What's happening?
<Ascendant> someone is attacking
<eXAKR> This server?
<Ascendant> stupid thing
<Draelen> the bots all pinged out
<Ascendant> weird
<Ascendant> well I'll leave it on for a bit
<Draelen> Pity, they all went away before I was about to mass join them
<Draelen> to the trap chan
<Ascendant> Ah
<Armageddon> o_O

<junh1024-XD> hi
<Kosovo> hiya
<junh1024-XD> i mayhave seen timmi before
<junh1024-XD> iduno
<Draelen> his IP was a tor node too
<Ascendant> Ascendant[BOPM] scan 245.255.103.97
<Ascendant[BOPM]> CHECK -> Checking '245.255.103.97' for open proxies on all scanners
<Ascendant> or not
<Ascendant> I forgot BOPM fails
<Ascendant> at doing that
<Draelen> it needs some configuration
<Ascendant[BOPM]> CHECK -> All tests on 245.255.103.97 completed.
<Draelen> an open port to tell the proxies to try connect to, in order to see if they are open or not
<Ascendant> [15:59:33] <+AmbernovaBOPM> CHECK -> DNSBL -> 97.103.255.245 appears in BL zone rbl.efnet.org (TOR exit server)
<Ascendant> 3.12 doesn't really
<TTEchidna> Hrmm...
<Draelen> in that case it can't check for new open proxies/etc which don't appear on lusts
<Draelen> lists*
<Draelen> and won't be as good
<Icydragon> hrmmm
<prince-dari> Spyrorocks
<TTEchidna> Can't seem to PM him.
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> I just left the default configuration
<Ascendant> for the proxy scanner section
<Draelen> :06:53:34: [timmi VERSION reply]: irssi v0.8.15 - running on FreeBSD amd64
<Draelen> :06:53:37: [timmi TIME reply]: Tue Apr 26 23:53:32 2011
<Draelen> fyi
<Ascendant> Ah
<Icydragon> blah
<Ascendant> freebsd
<Ascendant> lol
<Draelen> I'll keep that on
<Ascendant> did I accidentally unset that?
<Ascendant> ah okay
<Drake> 04ok
<Draelen> I unset it in hopes the bots would come and I could quickly dispatch them
<Drake> 04hi everyone
<Kosovo> hi
<Ascendant> looks like they didn't
<Ascendant> I should deoper now lol
<Ascendant> I'll leave BOPM on for now
<Draelen> bopm will be informative only for now until it's configured ;p
<Draelen> and won't take much action
<Ascendant> it doesn't scan properly
<Ascendant> using the scan command that is
<Draelen> I'll be online throughout the day while at work, so will try to help if they come back
<Draelen> leaving in ~5-10 mins
<Ascendant> okay cool
<Ascendant> hopefully they don't come back x-X
<Draelen> that +f should handle things a little in the meantime
<Draelen> 15 sec interval, +C when >5 ctcp, +R when >5 joins, +K when >2 knocks, +N when >4 nickchanges, +M when > 20 messages total, kick when >7 lines individual
<Draelen> +j 3:10, single person can't join more than 3 times in 10 seconds,
<Draelen> could restrict it a little more and possibly still not affect any legitimate users though
<Drake> 04so
<Drake> 04what's going on?
<Draelen> bot talk, and rawr
<Draelen> +f will not do to well however if the bots mass register
<Umbreon> 12!cynder
<Draelen> I should bring a copy of my network bot here, it monitors all the services stuff too and reverses mass registrations
<Ascendant> x_X
<Ascendant> well
<Draelen> and builds a database of known users, and knows when a botnet is connecting, and a normal users
<Ascendant> it doesn't look like they knew how to
<Ascendant> because if they did, they would have registered and joined the channel
<Ascendant> do you have services logchan enabled?
<Draelen> I don't monitor services here
<Ascendant> Ah okay
<Drake> 04have there been bot attacks or something?
<Ascendant> yeah
<Draelen> added you as admin, as you are one of the few who knows what to do here ;p
<Draelen> try enable logchan and check #services
<Ascendant> uh...I normally don't oper up xD
<Ascendant> sec
<Ascendant> wait...how the hell did you add me as an admin and allow me access to set?
<Ascendant> and not restart services?
*Draelen waves claws around mysteriously
<Ascendant> XD
<Draelen> /operserv admin add ascendant
<Ascendant> modded version of services that allows SAs access to set or something? XD
<Ascendant> yeah admin doesn't usually have access to /os set
<Ascendant> only SRA does...at least in 1.8.x
<Legend> Look at that baka.
<Umbreon> 12i take it your favorite movie is "I AM LEGEND"
<Armageddon> o_O
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari, yo
<prince-dari> TTEchidna wanted to talk to you about something.
<Spyrorocks> alright
<TTEchidna> Ah yes.
<TTEchidna> OKAY SO
<TTEchidna> THAT WIKI
<Spyrorocks> what about it
<TTEchidna> It lacks wondrous extensions which can make it prettyfied.
<TTEchidna> Like if statements.
<Spyrorocks> One sec ill install parser functions.
<Spyrorocks> also I still want your SFA site.
<TTEchidna> The old Spyro Fans Anonymous?
<Spyrorocks> yes.
<Spyrorocks> :P
<TTEchidna> Man, I don't even know if it's still active or if they recycled it.
<TTEchidna> And I lack the password as well as access to that.
<TTEchidna> Because I've changed my email a couple times since 2004.
<Spyrorocks> http://spyro.conforums3.com/
<Spyrorocks> its still alive
<TTEchidna> Unbelievable.
<Spyrorocks> figure it out and get me some access if you can :)
<TTEchidna> But why? Last post there's by replica handbags,
<TTEchidna> Which I don't believe is an ironic username.
<Spyrorocks> I want to incorporate it into spyroforum
<Spyrorocks> it still gets traffic that Iam interested in.
<TTEchidna> Isn't SpyroForum just the successor site to it?
<TTEchidna> ...SFA gets traffic?
<TTEchidna> Well, it's doubtful any redirects can be made, since Conforums owns it...
<Spyrorocks> Dont worry about technical details, I can take care of that
<Spyrorocks> just try to get me access :)
<TTEchidna> And I'm not Hunter, so the password on my account on Conforums isn't 22475.
<TTEchidna> The username's the default "admin" though.
<TTEchidna> I'll see what I can do.
<Spyrorocks> Thanks.
<TTEchidna> Hrm.
<TTEchidna> Can't think of what I used there.
<TTEchidna> Hi egg dear.
<Darkeiya> Hello.
<Spyrorocks> TTEchidna, try to use expressions now.
<Spyrorocks> and tellme if it works.
<Spyrorocks> hello Darkeiya
<TTEchidna> http://www.spyropedia.com/wiki/Skelos_Badlands
<TTEchidna> You tell me if it's working. Because it looks perfect to me!
<Spyrorocks> works fine I assume?
<Darkeiya> Ooh, you got the switch statements working!
<Spyrorocks> Yep
<Darkeiya> Though I feel corrupted. My first impression upon it now is "needs more roundycorners". orz
<Spyrorocks> Just installed the extension for you guys/.
<Darkeiya> Awesome. :D
<Spyrorocks> haha
<Spyrorocks> hey, I just noticed
<Spyrorocks> its rare to find a wiki that doesnt ask for money these days :P
<TTEchidna> Ah don't worry.
<TTEchidna> Once we're finished with it, this thing's gonna need eighteen servers to keep it from crashing.
<Darkeiya> Pfffff.
<Spyrorocks> Id put some ads up if we go major traffic
<Darkeiya> Let's not get too ambitious now, hon. Spyro may have a large fanbase, but it'll never be on the same caliber as larger franchises like Pokemon.
<TTEchidna> Not a threat. A serious speculation. Last wiki I made pretty went from one to eight servers in four years.
<Spyrorocks> Darkeiya, do I know you from anywhere?
<TTEchidna> SFA, of couuuuurse.
<Darkeiya> You might. I tend to use the same name everywhere.
<TTEchidna> I'm getting the old team back together. We're gonna make the lone independent Spyro wiki AWESOME.
<Darkeiya> I was one of the original administrators at Spyro Fans Anonymous.
<Kyu> 07nyan
<Spyrorocks> Anyways, its great you guys are working on the wiki.
<Spyrorocks> its got a good article base already, more is always good though.
<TTEchidna> Good article base...
<TTEchidna> *looks at Sor's page*
<TTEchidna> Well.
<TTEchidna> Better than nothing?
<Spyrorocks> Well, I thought it was good :P
<Ascendant> heya Kyu
<TTEchidna> The fact that it exists is good.
<Kyu> 07ohai
<Spyrorocks> spyropedia only gets about 35-45 unique hits a day as it is.
<TTEchidna> However everything could do with a powerup.
<TTEchidna> Now, why have I skulked back into the Spyro fandom?
<Ascendant> are you going to clear the voices or something? XD
<Ascendant> you could try /cs clear #Silverwings voices
<Ascendant> not sure if you have access
<Kyu> 07nope
<TTEchidna> ONE: SKYLANDERS. Now, why that? I hate it! AND THAT IS WHY.
<Ascendant> do it manually then? XD
<Spyrorocks> Oh also, heh.. http://www.spyropedia.ru/
<Kyu> 07nah :3
<TTEchidna> There's a Russian Spyro wiki.
<Spyrorocks> Looks like we got a russian sister site :P
<Ascendant> well then
<Darkeiya> Ooh.
<Spyrorocks> I havent done anything with the spyro fandom in like the last year or so.
<TTEchidna> I CANNOT READ IT
<TTEchidna> After Pok√©mon... I cannot be fazed by any other fandom.
<Darkeiya> Hm. Judging from their links, they've also found German and... Finnish sister sites too?
<TTEchidna> At least the wars between classic and legend Spyro fans can end because of Skylanders.
<Darkeiya> Eh, disregard that last bit. Seems to be wikias.
<Spyrorocks> I dont even know what skylanders is.
<Darkeiya> inb4 massive ranting tirade
<TTEchidna> You sir... are lucky.
<Darkeiya> HEY HON, BEFORE YOU START BITCHING, MIND UPLOADING THE OTHER TALISMAN IMAGES? :3
<Spyrorocks> BUT it is important TTEchidna that you make an effort to try to get the SFA details for me :)
<TTEchidna> ...yes I do.
<TTEchidna> If I remember them, I'll do so.
<Darkeiya> What SFA details?
<TTEchidna> Apparently it still gets traffic.
<Darkeiya> What, those old forums?
<Darkeiya> For real?
<Darkeiya> Jesus christ.

<Umbreon> 12nooooo
<TTEchidna> Hmm.
<Ascendant> also Kyu, can you kill Ascendant[BOPM] (to rehash it)
<Spyrorocks> I also am not impressed that spyropedia isnt #1 on google for the "spyro wiki" search
<TTEchidna> Well, it'll likely be nothing once Spyropedia... is souped up.
<Armageddon> D:
<Darkeiya> Spyropedia just needs to get souped up.
<TTEchidna> Also that logo is ugly but that's a given thanks to Legend 1 Spyro.
<Spyrorocks> It needs backlinks
<Spyrorocks> once people link to it from other websites our rank will increase.
<Kyu> 07can't
<Kyu> 07o3o
<TTEchidna> I'll negotiate with NIWA after we soup it up... I know you already link with WikiBound...
<Spyrorocks> I didnt really work on a logo i just used the old one from spyroworld.
<Darkeiya> Hm.
<Spyrorocks> TTEchidna, you wanna write news for spyroworld?
<Spyrorocks> its been kind of dead.
<TTEchidna> Considering all news is... Skylanders news...
<TTEchidna> *grumble*
<Spyrorocks> news is news.
<TTEchidna> Speaking of news, funny fact.
<TTEchidna> Because my idiot brother gave away my YotD game, I had to buy a new one.
<Spyrorocks> I also just noticed that darkspyro has like over a million posts now
<TTEchidna> And since I bought this new disc, it makes YotD the most recent Spyro game I've bought.
<TTEchidna> Not AHT, not SSL...
<TTEchidna> YotD. As it should be.

<Darkeiya> Hmm.
<TTEchidna> Hm.
<Spyrorocks> I offered to buy darkspyro one day you know.
<TTEchidna> Sounds like a Serebii/Bulbagarden war.
<Spyrorocks> Meh Im not into the spyro fandom like I once was
<Spyrorocks> if I was in it now id be even more ruthless :P
<Spyrorocks> Just kidding.
<TTEchidna> Hmm.
<TTEchidna> As for remaining talismans...
<TTEchidna> HERE
<TTEchidna> WE
<TTEchidna> GO
<Darkeiya> \o/
<Darkeiya> I'm gonna try and soup up the Talisman article.
<Spyrorocks> If you guys need anything else, shoot me an email or just say my nickname on here and it alerts me.
<Darkeiya> Though then that leaves the talisman pages to be deleted afterwards... hm.
<Darkeiya> Alrigh.
<TTEchidna> It really makes me feel weird to say this...
<TTEchidna> But the best thing to do?
<TTEchidna> GIFF ADIMZ POWAH PLZ
<Darkeiya> I think you might need to poke him with the name.
<Darkeiya> And speak more legibly.
<TTEchidna> dingding
<TTEchidna> SPYROROCKS
<TTEchidna> *poke*
<Spyrorocks> hey
<TTEchidna> What would make wiki working easier would be if... well, there were admins around.

<Light_Latias> night all
<Armageddon> derp
<drf|laptop> 03:<
<Armageddon> but we still have to have control of the other characters, Drake
<Armageddon> Are we doing it in first-person or third-person?
<Drake> 04obviously
<Armageddon> I prefer third-person
<Umbreon> 12don't go Light_Latias we'll miss you
<Drake> 04Your choice.
<Drake> 04I prefer thi-
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Umbreon> 12or at least drf will
<Armageddon> HIVEMIND
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Armageddon> I tend to write like
*drf|laptop sighs
<Armageddon> Xion's Story-way in first person
<Armageddon> don't like it
<drf|laptop> 03I think I barely passed physics... but at the point where it's not actually going to help my GPA...
<Armageddon> makes me sound like a retarded grandma or something
<Drake> 04You tend to write crap fics in first person.
<Drake> 04Understandable.
*Drake hides
<Armageddon> not that I don't already
<Armageddon> but
<Armageddon> and true
<Armageddon> XD

<drf|laptop> 03well anyway
<drf|laptop> 03I'm gonna go to bed too
<Ascendant> o-o
<Drake> 04So
<Drake> 04I'm going to start out in Aus, because that's where I actually am.
<Drake> 04Are you also going to start out in Aus or do you want to live in Antarctica?
*Drake shot
<Armageddon> I'll start with the later, Drake ;)
<Armageddon> nah, I'll be in australia
<Armageddon> actually
<Armageddon> how about we know each other from school or something
<Armageddon> latter*
<Drake> 04Sure
<Armageddon> well yeah, school or something
<Armageddon> and then we get there
<Armageddon> and we're like
<Drake> 04Do you want us to be friends or not know each other much?
<Armageddon> "NATHAN?!?!" "RHY?!?!?!"
<Armageddon> friends
<Drake> 04K
<Armageddon> And Xeli
<Armageddon> an be
<Armageddon> a random person
<Armageddon> who we're thrown together with
<Drake> 04sure
<Drake> 04or
<Armageddon> we can know him from the internet?

<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04Actually.
<Drake> 04I'd rather sort out the characters first.
<Drake> 04We need the supreme executive chairman of the mercenary company first.
<Drake> 04Then our summaries.
<Drake> 04Then maybe some extra teammates.
<Armageddon> bloody hell
<Armageddon> why is compiling on windows
<Armageddon> like compiling Timmi's penis
<Armageddon> or Drake's for that matter
<Armageddon> I mean
<Armageddon> that aside
<Armageddon> and hm
<Armageddon> chairman
<Armageddon> somehow I see Shiny as that
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> we can make him Karl
<Armageddon> or just use his character
<Drake> 04We don't need everyone from this IRC in the story you know

<Umbreon> 12i've been playing too much vietnamese crystal
<drf|laptop> 03but the really odd thing is
<drf|laptop> 03my mom's desktop, which is plugged in with ethernet, hates this new Netgear router
<drf|laptop> 03and I can't for the life of me figure out why
<eXAKR> It hates you'
<drf|laptop> 03it doesn't even say 'device unplugged', it straight up says NO NETWORK HARDWARE FOUND
<drf|laptop> 03Like, the actual ethernet port
<drf|laptop> 03on the motherboard
<drf|laptop> 03despite hte green lights being on the router's "1" light being on meaning there's a solid connection...
<Umbreon> 12hmm

<TTEchidna> LOOK AT MY LITTLE PONY
<TTEchidna> IT'S AMAZING
<TTEchidna> GIVE IT A LICK
<TTEchidna> (it tastes just like raisins)
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Mine is this Netgear N300 WIRELESS GIGABIT ADSL2+ MODEM ROUTER
<TTEchidna> BY A STROKE OF ITS MANE IT TURNS INTO A NACHO
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Or the DGN3500 XD
<drf|laptop> 03yeah mine is that without the ADSL modem
<TTEchidna> THEN IT TURNS GAY
<TTEchidna> THEN IT TURNS INTO SPAIN
<drf|laptop> 03since... well, we have cable
<drf|laptop> 03but anyway how did you fix it?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> http://www.netgear.co.uk/home/products/wirelessrouters/work-and-play/DGN3500.aspx
<TTEchidna> THEN IT TURNS BACK INTO PINKIE
<TTEchidna> (ooh that's dirty)
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I didn't
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I just restarted my comp and router
<drf|laptop> 03LOL WTF
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Everything was fine after that
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> If that doesn't fix it, it's something to do with the Modem not supporting the Router
<Umbreon> 12hmm]
<drf|laptop> 03well see, it works perfectly fine with wi-fi
<drf|laptop> 03it's just the Ethernet that's not working, and ONLY my mom's computer
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hmm
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Might be the port on the computer itself
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03it works if I plug the modem straight into the computer
<drf|laptop> 03just not through the router
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hmm
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> How many ethernet ports does the router have?
<drf|laptop> 034
<drf|laptop> 03yes I tried all of them
*Quilava nibbles Umbreon
*Umbreon licks
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Right ok, what speed can the PC's E-port handle?
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03you know, that's a good point
<drf|laptop> 03the router is gigabit, and the computer is probably only 10/100
<drf|laptop> 03that would do it, eh? LOL
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I have a 500MBPs ethernet card in my PC and that works fine
<Quilava> how is?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I wish I could find some way to make it work though...
<Umbreon> 12a little tired
<Umbreon> 12and today i have to go to the college to get fillings done
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Well if it's a the new Netgear model, a 100MBPs E-card won't run it (not without difficulty anyway)
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I had to fork out ¬£50 to get a new Ethernet Card

<Griggs> what coast do you live on again
<Jason> Say you were not capable of using the phone at the time and sue them

<SilverSonic> there we go
<SilverSonic> XD
<Creideiki> Nice.
<Creideiki> Not as awesome as an ASR-33 though. :P
<nickstr> perhaps
<nickstr> but my interests lean toward that
<Creideiki> You know, if you broadcast an hourly, or bi-hourly RTTY news bulletin you might get more listeners (who are HAMs). :P
<nickstr> you are forgetting a big factor
<nickstr> POWER LIMITS
<nickstr> I can't run more than 100 mW or I will be in big trouble
<nickstr> slapped with a fine of several thousand dollars
<Creideiki> So? A RTTY news bulletin won't need you to run high power. :P
<nickstr> actually you do
<Creideiki> Plus, it'll give your transmitter a nice excercise.
<nickstr> for any respectable coverage
<Creideiki> (By running at full power...)
<nickstr> not so
<nickstr> even with processing the most you can get with 100 mW is four miles
<Creideiki> 4 miles is enough for local news.
<nickstr> not really
<nickstr> only one or two others near me are amateur radio operators
<nickstr> not much potential
<nickstr> narrowcasting does not make much sense with that kind of range
<Creideiki> True enough.
<Creideiki> Well, I'ma head out, as it's getting late, and I have stuff to do early tomorrow.
<Armageddon> o-o

<prince-dari> Some fans of Dramatica wondered if this was an elaborate troll or an April Fool‚Äôs joke; visiting Dramatica‚Äôs old IP address, 208.99.87.133, gave a message that was interpreted by some to mean that Dramatica was only temporarily offline. But the redirect is permanent, Encyclopedia Dramatica founder and current OhInternet primary contributor Sherrod DeGrippo told me by email, and OhInternet is here to stay.
<Armageddon> wat
<prince-dari> The founder decided it was time for a change.
<Armageddon> ._______.
<Drake> 04I don't know if he's 'shaping up' or if it's a big 'take that' to the internet.
<Armageddon> that's retarded though
<Armageddon> why would he do that, owning a site as big and popular as ED?
<Drake> 04'Cause his parents found out.

<Drake> 04WHY THE HELL IS IT 'TONED DOWN'?

<Drake> 04Maybe then it might be worth recompiling the servers.
<Armageddon> probably
<Armageddon> I could probably write some modules and add them to the servers instead of having to take them down and recompile
<Armageddon> if there's a security update then I'll recompile

<Umbreon> 12the 25th there was only ranks 100 through 81
<Espeon> 06I'm rather curious what #1 will be now
<Umbreon> 12if it's magikarp

<Umbreon> 12well lucario and umbreon are my top favorites
<Umbreon> 12so D:
<Umbreon> 12i'm all out of stuff i want to make it to the top
<Drake> 04I bet they'll get lazy and just choose Pikachu
<Espeon> 06lol
<Umbreon> 12pikachu is already in the top 100
<Espeon> 06Isn't that the result of that thing where users clicked their fave of two Pokemon or something?
<Umbreon> 12that wasn't how they did the process
<Espeon> 06or is this "editors pick"
<Umbreon> 12yeah it was a whole bunch of voting
<Espeon> 06Ah yeah
<Espeon> 06then I'm surprised Lucario isn't higher for
<Umbreon> 12http://www.ign.com/top/pokemon/48
<Espeon> 06reasons
<Espeon> 06.-.
<Umbreon> 12i know we will see gengar, blastoise, charizard, and venusaur

<Drake> 04So far, I have two characters in DU, with two awaiting approval.
<Drake> 04I make way too many characters o-o
<Umbreon> 12i badly wanted all the eeveelutions to make it
<Umbreon> 12but i doubt leafeon is going to top everyone else
<Drake> 04Yeah
*TerrorBite licks Umbreon
<Drake> 04Leafeon was never particularly popular.
*Umbreon eeps
<Umbreon> 12Drake tcg it was very popular
<Umbreon> 12leafeon lv. x was like a 50 dollar card for awhile
<Umbreon> 12XD
<Drake> 04H-uh
<Umbreon> 12still is rather expensive as well
<Drake> 04But it's not exactly memorable.
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Drake> 04When you think of the eeveelutions, it's very rarely the first one that comes to mind.
<Umbreon> 12considering i have a gigantic leafeon poster on my wall
<Umbreon> 12it's hard not to think of it
<Drake> 04XD
<Espeon> 06When I think of them Leafeon is in fact one of the first that comes to mind o.O
<Umbreon> 12we're missing the most important one of all as well
<Umbreon> 12eevee has yet to make it
<Drake> 04odd
<Umbreon> 12eevee and leafeon are the two that havn't appeared
