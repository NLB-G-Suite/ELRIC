<Vivix> the way one pronounces*
<Jmo4267> oink said.
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> That's what I hear in my head, eevery time
<Chrysalis> broken shield is broken
<Vivix> Magicka is fun, but when it lgags its just crazy
<Vivix> Like how you can die during cutscenes and end the game-
<Jmo4267> ^
<Vivix> I fell out of the stairs during lag, and it just said GAME OVER, and NOTHING happened
<Vivix> we had to restart-
<Chrysalis> see you dont get fun glitches like that in AAA
<Vivix> That map there is hard, but it's doable if you -- try for instance rock and ice combo, insane amount of dammage on those big ones
<Vivix> I think it's rock rock ice ice rock.. long time since I played
<Chrysalis> deeeeeeeeead
<alexxm> well that went well

<Jmo4267> What a hater :<
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix: Aww really? But the references were funny. :S
<Vivix> I'm not much of a meme guy, or anything like that, so I didn't get most of them

<PsychoticDoc> LightTrooper105: holy tits!, ive been a member for a while but until today i hadnt really used my membership
<Vivix> Jmo4267: that sounds pretty bad-
<Jmo4267> It is.
<Vivix> our isp usually keep what they promise, and if they can't guarantee you get cheapest price and letter of warning
<Jmo4267> Luckily fibre optic is being built in my area.
<Vivix> Ohh nice..I want that so bad
<Jmo4267> Worst part is I'm paying $140 a month for my current speeds.
<Vivix> !
<Jmo4267> Brutality.
<AdamTheDuck> wut.
<AdamTheDuck> That's insanity.
<Jmo4267> Yep.
<Vivix> I think we paay..
*Vivix google converts
<Vivix> 80 dollars for the wireless we're going to try
<Jmo4267> lolwireless
<Vivix> we might get 3G+, which would be way better than 0.6
<Vivix> I knoow- but its our only option
<Jmo4267> Glitched again. BOOOM
<LightTrooper105> PsychoticDoc you were a member.. under what name? o.o
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Jmo4267> That's painful Vivix.

<Kandarihu> Khanfound that Khan! He drives us to restart!
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, rejoin?
<LightTrooper105> i see what you did there
<Jmo4267> Still, compare this to release and you'll see a huge difference.
<Vivix> -yeaah
<Phase4> 00,02o i c
<Phase4> 00,02he has to be on fire so he dies
<LightTrooper105> should I keep this char or change..
<Phase4> 00,02when cutsceen starts
<LightTrooper105> ahh ok
<Vivix> Ooh
<Kandarihu> When I solo'd Adventure Mode, one boss that is fought twice, I killed both times by causing him to fly off the screen. He immediately teleported back to the screen for his post-defeat cutscene.
<Kandarihu> I'm on my old computer, now.

<AdamTheDuck> Vivix: That's steam time for ya.

<Jmo4267> 50kbps. You poor soul.
<Vivix> when I buy a new steam game, my friends usually download it for me and give it to me on usb stick ;3
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<Jmo4267> That's an interesting idea.
<AdamTheDuck> ...My only weakness...
<Kandarihu> Loss of blood, my only weakness
<Jmo4267> Morning RaveBrony
<Vivix> Marnin!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello RaveBrony
<LightTrooper105> and all i got to do is stand there and revive you..
<alexxm> how you doing RaveBrony
<Vivix> Yay! No crash
<Jmo4267> Dat Vlad
*RaveBrony waves to Jmo4267, Vivix, AdamTheDuck, and alexxm :)
<[Alpha]> Well I tried it butI still don't know the appeal for minecraft
<RaveBrony> Im doing good, alexxm, and yourself?
<alexxm> i'm good RaveBrony
<LightTrooper105> hello RaveBrony
<Phase4> 00,02BLEIGH
<alexxm> what langauge is that
<LightTrooper105> i walk too slow..
<Vivix> just nonsense words, alexxm
<LightTrooper105> Vampire Language
<[Alpha]> :S
<Vivix> [Alpha]: minecraft is not for everyone- I find myself only really enjoying Technic minecraft at the moment
<Jmo4267> Some of it is Swedish, the rest is made up words.
<Kandarihu> Don't forget to get the Blizzard Magick
<RaveBrony> Hey, LightTrooper105 :)
<[Alpha]> technic?
<Vivix> it's a mod that adds oils, animals, and stuff- pipes and pumps and whatnot
<Vivix> I run a stable and a quarry-
<Vivix> I even got a pegasus named Tamara
<Vivix> It also adds millenaire, if you use the old 6.0.7 version
<[Alpha]> That sounds cool but I've seen a mod where you can play Left for Dead on minecraft
<Vivix> Ah yeah, I saw that too
<[Alpha]> Well I tried making a derpy oixel art image and it took me forever to even start it
<[Alpha]> p
<Vivix> hehe yeah-
<[Alpha]> So I gave up on iy for the time being
<[Alpha]> it
<Kandarihu> This is where the stage gets trippy
<[Alpha]> Wrek is a an amazing artist I've seen some of his work and I wish I could reqch that type of skill
<Chrysalis> practice
<Jmo4267> ^
<[Alpha]> Kind of hard when you are both persistent but bore easily
<[Alpha]> weird game
<[Alpha]> ...
<Vivix> I'm back baby
<[Alpha]> good thing I'm a visual learner
<Vivix> I love drawing, but I hate finishing drawings
<Vivix> I jsut got a plethora of sketches
<andy> show us some of your stuff?
<Vivix> I think I only got a--tiny deer sketch uploaed? /check
<[Alpha]> I just started to want to learn how to draw about a week ago other than that I didn't have much interest in it
<andy> k
<Vivix> http://mivix.deviantart.com/ yeah, sketch and a landscape with ap ony
<andy> yea im at the same stage myself
<andy> having serious lazyness problems
<Jmo4267> o:
<Vivix> I used to go to the art line in..I guess high school is what you'd call it
<Jmo4267> I love the sunrise picture.
<Vivix> but then I took a six year break from art
<Vivix> untiil-PONIES
<andy> yay
<Vivix> Thanks!
<andy> ponies inspire so many great things
<Vivix> Yeaah
<[Alpha]> It seems Istill have many things to learn
<andy> yea dont we all
<Vivix> Never stop learning, it's fun
<[Alpha]> At one point I was quite good at website design then I got bored of it and it went right out the window
<Vivix> Hehehe
<andy> window :D
<Vivix> I used to do some website stuff when I was a kid
<andy> because its a website
<Vivix> but--just html, and now all that stuff is oudated
<andy> yea html is almost never used on its own
<[Alpha]> html5 is pretty much taking over but it is still in a prototype stage
<Vivix> yeah-
<Vivix> php and css are the biggest online atm, I think
<Vivix> but it all outputs html
<andy> that sunrise thing reminds me of fallout equestria
<Vivix> Oo, good- it was very inspired by it
<[Alpha]> ....yeah don't really want to know
<Vivix> it was a cover for my littlepip tribute song-
<andy> nice
<andy> link?
<[Alpha]> I'm just gonna stick to drawing on ipad for the moment and see where that takes me
<Vivix> Well- the stream is on- are we allowed to link?
<andy> dunno
<[Alpha]> images yes
<andy> i guess better to be safe
<Jmo4267> If you have ask phase nicely.
<Jmo4267> Fail wording. If you ask phase nicely^
<Vivix> yeaah-
<Vivix> Well, on EQBeats I'm Vivix, and it's the newest song there
<DalekKahn> Image links are always fine for the most part as long as you don't spam them
<Vivix> ah yeah- it's a yt link though, so
<Vivix> on youtube it's VivixPony, should be newest song there too
*Vivix evades link rule
<andy> this is pretty good
<Vivix> Thanks ;3
<andy> funny how a lot of bronies do creative stuff like this
<matthias2d> what is this games name?
<andy> i think its the community that inspires it
<Jmo4267> Magicka matthias2d
<matthias2d> ty
<Vivix> yeaah, it's a great community for it
<Jmo4267> Pretty good song.
<Vivix> Thanks ^^
<[Alpha]> stream ...needs fodd
<[Alpha]> food
<[Alpha]> :D
<Vivix> A cooking show?
<andy> do you mean content?
<[Alpha]> That would be so funny us learning how to cook on Bronystate
<andy> lol
<andy> i dont think i ever learned anything from cooking shows
<[Alpha]> I also took culinary arts
<Vivix> I've learned a lot from hairy bikers
<[Alpha]> :S
<Vivix> It was my favourite cooking show-
<Jmo4267> That sounds..delightful?
<Phase4> 00,02guuuu
<Vivix> it iiis
<[Alpha]> skandanavian?
<pony_5252> what game is it ?
<Vivix> they're like two chubby bikers, that are really nice, and make lots of fun food
<Jmo4267> Magicka pony_5252
<Vivix> british
<pony_5252> ok thanks
<Vivix> BBC show, I think
<Jmo4267> Oh that show.
<Vivix> I learned how to make sugarfold..thing for cakes via hairybikers
<Vivix> since I don't eat marzipan, that meant I could make birthday cakes ;D
<Jmo4267> The cake is a lie.
<Vivix> Well- it looked real
<Jmo4267> Your brain is playing tricks on you.
<Jmo4267> YOU'RE DELUSIONAL!
<[Alpha]> :|
<Vivix> I KNOW! BUT ITS SO NICE
<Jmo4267> FACE THE DAMN TRUTH ALREADY.
<[Alpha]> phase4 are you playing co-op or do you get a partner?
<Jmo4267> Co-op^
<Phase4> 00,02[Alpha], co op
<[Alpha]> Ok thank you
<Vivix> my stream died
<LightTrooper105> shoudl we try to get the o0ther now?
<Jmo4267> Shock horror.
<[Alpha]> damn
<Vivix> nullify!
<andy> thunderbolt is op
<[Alpha]> :O
<LightTrooper105> dam vampire..
<Vivix> Nice
<Jmo4267> nemnemnemnem
<Vivix> surtein dum
<[Alpha]> I'm gonna eat some cheerios
<LightTrooper105> ahve fun
<andy> why is there always a desktop pony on these streams? is it required?
<Jmo4267> Just a preference.
<Vivix> It helps us see who streams
<[Alpha]> I'm always daydreaming so I have fun . Of sorts
<andy> ahh
<Kandarihu> This is your chance to get an achievement.
<Vivix> like that's Phase's pony
<Vivix> Skogfisk?
<Kandarihu> No monsters in this stage, so don't use any spells, just magick
<andy> skogfisk is demons :D
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> actually, skogfisk sounds kinda scary
<Vivix> just imagine a giant walking fish in the woods at night-
<andy> idk about that
<Vivix> gaping and staring at you -
<Jmo4267> That'd be an interesting encounter.
<andy> fisk is the danish word for fish
<andy> kind of kills the scaryness
<[Alpha]> A gaint walking fish? Sounds like walking lunch
<Vivix> yeahh but like
<Vivix> okay imagine you're walking in the forest, and you just see a really really tall thing, with a fishhead , BLANK eyes and opening and closing mouth
<[Alpha]> Lunch
<String_Shredder> that dude reminds me of "Rob Schneider, derpdy derp"
<andy> i'd probably freak out a little
<Vivix> AWw..
<Vivix> hehehe
<alexxm> every one laughs ending
<Phase4> 00,02i'm convinced that everyone in this game is an internet user
<Vivix> yeeep
<Jmo4267> What was your first hint?
<[Alpha]> Why?
<andy> i think most everyone in the world is an internet user
<andy> except maybe some third world countries
<Vivix> 60% I think?
<Nyst> You should invite some other people to join!
<andy> that few?
<LightTrooper105> lol'
<Vivix> I'm not sure. might be more now
<andy> increasing every day probably
<Vivix> but considering china has a lto of traditional settlements without internet, and such-
<[Alpha]> I have never heard of this game but I already like it
<andy> china is pretty large
<Vivix> That it is
<andy> it would be wierd to just cut off internet one day
<Vivix> I wonder what would happen-
<andy> freak everyone out
<Vivix> I mean, kids in the 70s still had fun
<andy> exactly
<andy> internet can be inhibiting
<Vivix> but if you greew up wiht internet- it would be horrible
<[Alpha]> I'd go to sleep
<andy> yea
<andy> bye Alpha
<Vivix> yeah-
<[Alpha]> bye?
<andy> oh misread
<andy> as i'm going to sleep
<Vivix> hehe

<[Alpha]> Wow today must be a good day for everypony
<alexxm> sup Dark92Enigma
<TOY_PON3> [Alpha]: Indeed it is ^^ I hope you have a good day aswell
<BronyJenkins> Yeah, I'm feeling awesome today too. c:
<TOY_PON3> BronyJenkins: Great to hear that ^^
*TOY_PON3 is overflowing with kindness today :)
*BronyJenkins explodes with joy
<[Alpha]> hmm I wonder if hasbro would make MLP cereal
<TOY_PON3> that would be neat
<TOY_PON3> [Alpha]: But what kind of cereal? Like Cap'n Crunch? Lucky Charms?
<Alister> I'd say lucky charms
<[Alpha]> I guess they would be more like lucky charms
<TOY_PON3> Mmmm
<Vivix> I've never had luckycharms..
<BronyJenkins> Nor have I
<Alister> Even tough I don't like lucky charms
<[Alpha]> :O
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: You should. And you too BronyJenkins
<Jmo4267> o.O
<Vivix> they don't have them here
<Vivix> american cereal looks delicious-
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Where?
<Vivix> Norway
<BronyJenkins> Yeah, British here.
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Ohh nice :3
<Vivix> I rarely have cereal, but when I do it's usually like.. Müsli stuff
<Vivix> Hehe, it's a nice place
<TOY_PON3> I am American so yeah I get those type of cereals that are the ones I mentioned
<Vivix> yeee-
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: I would love to visit there some day :)
<Vivix> sometimes my sister would buy american candy from eBay
<Vivix> man you guys got a lot of weird and tastys tuff
<BronyJenkins> I have to stay off the Gluten so I can't have most cereals. :/
*[Alpha] Is thinking of shipping cereal to other countries but the shipping would be through the roof
<Vivix> Aww
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Yeah unfortunately we are popular for junk food :/
<Vivix> hehe yee-
<Vivix> I noticed we're not allowed to buy energy drinks from USA though-
<BronyJenkins> I gotta go to America some time. :P
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Why not? o.o
<TOY_PON3> BronyJenkins: Sounds like a plan xD
<[Alpha]> Don't they are freaking evil
<Vivix> No idea- thhinkgeek just said "We can't ship energy drinks"
<Vivix> my dad wants us all to go to texas to look at cars
<BronyJenkins> My friend ships energy drinks constantly
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: I don't drink that stuff so really I wouldn't know :/
<Vivix> hm- maybe it's just a site policy
<[Alpha]> Want me to explain?
<BronyJenkins> Possibly.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hey guys
<BronyJenkins> Sure [Alpha]
<TOY_PON3> I tried that energy drink Rockstar, it tasted like motor oil so I threw it away ._.
<TOY_PON3> hey DoctoDoctorWho
<Vivix> Haha, wow yeah-
*Dark92Enigma .........
<Vivix> I usually drink one called burn, tastes kinda nice
<BronyJenkins> I like Moster and Relentless.
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Cool ^^
<BronyJenkins> Monster*
<Vivix> Ah yeah- yellow monster I've had a few times
<BronyJenkins> Yeah, it's good stuff.
<TOY_PON3> I tried the Purple Monster before they went off shelves. It was good
<Vivix> ah yeah-
<alexxm> why was the purple monster pulled
<TOY_PON3> I even have a shirt of the Monster logo colored Purple
<TOY_PON3> and not sure alexx
<Vivix> I remember when I was 14 it was really cool for people to buy energy drinks and like.."Oh man I'm gonna get buzzed on caffeine" it was so lame
<TOY_PON3> alexxm*
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Hehe
<[Alpha]> Alright the reason you get an energy ruch from energy udrinks is due to the fact that it allows your cells tu multipl at a faster rate incereasing your energy surge but in the process also lowering your life span. Also all the chemicals inside of it are dangerous
<Vivix> Kids will be kids
<TOY_PON3> [Alpha]: That right there is the reason i don't drink it anymore
<Vivix> Mm most energy drinks are just caffeine- at least the ones I've had
<BronyJenkins> Yep, my friend has 2 energy drinks every day. I think he's addicted. >_<
<TOY_PON3> BronyJenkins: That's not good
<Vivix> Still- I prefer soda or watever over it--
<Vivix> water* not whatever
<TOY_PON3> I prefer water over soda
<TOY_PON3> But soda is nice to have every so often
<Vivix> yeah
<[Alpha]> Yeah if you drink it enought you can get diabettes
<TOY_PON3> True
<Vivix> I drink way too much soda--
*Dark92Enigma all of a sudden learns that a friend of his suffered a stroke
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: What's your favorite type?
<[Alpha]> I quit soda at the end of last year
<TOY_PON3> Dark92Enigma: Oh no...sorry to hear that..
<Vivix> Ehh, Sprite or red fanta
<TOY_PON3> [Alpha]: Maybe that's for the best
<[Alpha]> :O
<Vivix> !
<Jmo4267> Mmm red fanta.
<String_Shredder> ooooooiiiii
<BronyJenkins> I like Frijj Milkshakes.
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Sprite and Orange Fanta for me x3
<TOY_PON3> I'm not really fan of Pepsi and Coke Cola
<Vivix> me neither-
<RaveBrony> :P
<BronyJenkins> Do you guys have Frijj in America?
<RaveBrony> Water ftw!
<TOY_PON3> I try to stay away from the dark sodas. Not that that sounds racist or anything ^^''
<[Alpha]> frijj?
<Vivix> Water, and tea!
<Vivix> hehe
<BronyJenkins> It's n awesome milkshake.
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony: Water is best thing to drink ^^
<BronyJenkins> Tea is awesome.
<RaveBrony> TOY_PON3: Yeah! :$
<TOY_PON3> Unfortunately I'm addicted to Powerade though T-T
<Vivix> Aww
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<[Alpha]> Water? Better drink my own piss
<TOY_PON3> xD
<BronyJenkins> And water... I love water so much on a really hot day.
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> Yeah- or whe nyou're just so thirsty nothing else will do
<TOY_PON3> I always drink the Fruit Punch Powerade whenever I get the chance to buy one. They're pretty cheap
<BronyJenkins> Yeah.
<TOY_PON3> BronyJenkins: Cold water is the best
<DoctoDoctorWho> How do I acsess vinyl scratch to make a request?
<Vivix> I think most powerade is around. 5 bucks? here
<[Alpha]> bleah they taste crummy to me but then again water taste delicious to me o.0
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: o-o It's 50 cents here
<RaveBrony> DoctoDoctorWho: Requests arent open atm :P
<Vivix> It's only open when the mod shouts it's open
<Vivix> most drink is around 3-5 dollars here I think
<Dark92Enigma> TOY_PON3: I sincerely hope he's OK....
<TOY_PON3> Gee willickers the prices sure are different in other countries ._.
<TOY_PON3> Dark92Enigma: Me too
<RaveBrony> DoctoDoctorWho: but you join it by typing "/join" then the name of the channel
<Vivix> I ohpe so to Dark92Enigma , even if I am terrible at expressing--it
<Vivix> too*
<pony_4185> magicka again! WHY WAS I NOT INFORM ED :[
<DoctoDoctorWho> that makes sense, Im still relativly new to Bronystate so I dont know all the in's and out's yet:)
<TOY_PON3> lol
<pony_4185> oops, forgot my nick
<Vivix> We got a different pay economy too though TOY_PON3

<Vivix> Hiya
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Yeah :/
<Flyboy> hurro
<TOY_PON3> hi Flyboy
<Flyboy> hi everypony
<RaveBrony> chat derp
<BronyJenkins> Oh, then welcome DoctoDoctorWho. Don't think I've seen you here before.
<Flyboy> so who's playing this time?
<TOY_PON3> Erm I don't know why but I like to drink a lot of milk ._.
<Vivix> I think. I'm not sure, that minimum wage is 15 000 dollars a year- don't know how that compares
<BronyJenkins> Milk is awesome, 'specially on it's own.
<[Alpha]> mmmm oreos
<Vivix> like I think if you're unemployed you canget around 14 000 a year until you find a job
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Me neither, luckly I'm taking Govt./Economy next year for my senior year ^^''
<Vivix> Ah, nice
<TOY_PON3> Mhm!
<Vivix> I-- kinda maybe want to be an accountant
<Vivix> but all my education is in art and music, ha
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Hmm you'll eventually know what you want to become
<Vivix> No idea if I would like it as a job- but it sounds kinda interesting
<Vivix> yeah
<TOY_PON3> I would like to be a journalist
<alexxm> well that went well
<BronyJenkins> I'm not sure what I want to be, I think I might run a business in future.
<TOY_PON3> :P
<[Alpha]> All I know is if I get a job behind a desk I'm going to shoot myself
<Vivix> Ah yeah, My friend was going down that road, but then he quit school and moved to another city to get an education in game design
<alexxm> i'm studying media so i'll probably get a media job
<TOY_PON3> Oooo
<Jmo4267> Muffins.
<TOY_PON3> how do xD
<TOY_PON3> brb gonna serve myself breakfast
<BronyJenkins> I remember work expirience... working with a filing system... never again.
<Vivix> Something smells odd- brb search for said smell
<BronyJenkins> experience*
<[Alpha]> I've had experience working behind a desk. I think they call it school?
<BronyJenkins> >,<
<[Alpha]> :D
<Vivix> bk
<BronyJenkins> Brb getting myself some food
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> I mostly worked with just--mowing lawns and cleaning and stuff
<Vivix> I am probably going to go back to school to get a more focused education
<BronyJenkins> Nom. :3
<[Alpha]> I took carpentry classes
<Vivix> Carpentry can be pretty cool
<[Alpha]> I find it fun
<BronyJenkins> Yeah, Carpentry is awesome.
<Vivix> I kinda want to make guitars as a hobby, and carpentry would have helped a lot there
<BronyJenkins> I like construction work.
<BronyJenkins> [And Demolition. :3]
<Vivix> hehehe
<[Alpha]> :D
<BronyJenkins> Anyway, I g2g.
<TOY_PON3> kay I'm back :3
<BronyJenkins> Bye!
<TOY_PON3> aww later BronyJenkins
<Vivix> Awkai, byee
<[Alpha]> bye
<TOY_PON3> I remember when I first wanted to be a therapist, then I realized I can't be patient when it comes to certain people :3
<alexxm> bye BronyJenkins
<Vivix> aw yeah
<Vivix> I had a certain desire to be a sexologist
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: o///o
<Vivix> but--I'm terrified of scary people
<Vivix> and I'd probably meet a few scary people then
<Vivix> It's really interesting!
<Jmo4267> ...Wait what
<TOY_PON3> lol I'm not sure what that deals with though. The name gives it away though
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Well its not that perverted-
<Vivix> it's like..
<Vivix> how does a sexuality develop? How do you GET a fetish? Why does certain things appeal to this and that and so forth
<Vivix> it's just a therapist specializing in that field, I figure
<TOY_PON3> Oh. Yeah it's kinda interesting but I'm nervous to find out such things
<Vivix> yeah- I'm just-- I don't think I'd be cut out to deal with people who needed help that way
<TOY_PON3> Yeah if that's how you feel
<Vivix> yeah-
<DoctoDoctorWho> I am a sort of minor expert in fetishes, which are we discussing? gore? insect? furry?
*TOY_PON3 blinks
<Jmo4267> ._.
<Jmo4267> Let's not expand that topic.
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Vivix> cause I mean, a lot of them work with like- correcting an unwanted sexuality, like if you have an unwanted attraction to children, you will often be sent to a sexologist
<[Alpha]> Leave me from this. I still don't know my talent so my job prevernces are askew right now
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> yeah-
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Pedo DO NOT WANT x3
<Vivix> yeaah- so I don't think I could work in it
<BronyJenkins> Nvm, I'm back on an irc. :3
<Vivix> but the research around OTHER thigns, sounds so interesting
<TOY_PON3> I don't blame you ._.
<TOY_PON3> And welcome back BronyJenkins you just missed an interesting topic :3
<Vivix> hehehe
<Jmo4267> 'interesting'
<Vivix> Welcome back
<TOY_PON3> indeed ;)
<Vivix> well, we arent alowed to go over PG, most of the time
<BronyJenkins> Lol, alrighty. :_:
<TOY_PON3> Yeah xD
<DoctoDoctorWho> they still havent told me what fetish they were discussing:S
<Jmo4267> AND THEY NEVER WILL.
<Vivix> well none in specifics-
<Jmo4267> NEW TOPIC.
<TOY_PON3> We're not talking about a certain type
<[Alpha]> :S
<TOY_PON3> xD
<Vivix> just- iot would be interesting to learn how they develop and such
<BronyJenkins> O_o
<TOY_PON3> I don't like where this is going :D
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: yeah I understand
<BronyJenkins> O____________o
<Vivix> hehehe
<DoctoDoctorWho> lets talk about crossovers then
<[Alpha]> This is quite humorous
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> It iis
<TOY_PON3> lol
<Vivix> but yeah Docto we were talking about jobs, and I mentioned I had a desie to be a sexologist-
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ok Phase4, im here and ready one you get tired ^_^
<Vivix> now- HOW BOUT them ..spots team
<Phase4> 00,02almost done
<Phase4> 00,02this last one
<Jmo4267> DEAR LORD, MAKE IT STOP.
<TOY_PON3> morning Wrek|Observiking
<BronyJenkins> Lol, k
<Vivix> We're done! Honest
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Oh ok xD
<DoctoDoctorWho> what is the mok, so what is the most unlikely crossover you have ever come across?
<Jmo4267> I will flip the next person who mentions it.
<[Alpha]> crossover?
<TOY_PON3> Jmo4267: Plz don't ;~;
<Vivix> most unlikely? I did see DBZ x Pony crossover once
<Vivix> I didn't read it, though
*Jmo4267 glomps TOY_PON3
*BronyJenkins is slow at typing on an irc
<DoctoDoctorWho> I read a warhammer 40k mlp crossover, 0_0 strange...
<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo4267> Mmm WH40k
<TheMaster> Was it good?
<TheMaster> also. Hello Doctor
*TOY_PON3 huggles Jmo4267
<Vivix> my FAVOURITE crossover, however, is fallout
<Vivix> mainly because I felt it was pulled off so fluently-
<TOY_PON3> brb gonna do..a favor for somepony ^^'
<Wrek|Observiking> 05FO:E is too much for me
<DoctoDoctorWho> it was f***ing hilarious
<Jmo4267> 650k+ words.
<TheMaster> I want to see a Neon Genesis Evangellion crossover
*Jmo4267 flips table
<Vivix> Aww-
<TOY_PON3> Jmo4267: Nuuu~
<[Alpha]> Haven't read a crossover but I have found out there's a MLP Dead space crossover :'(
<Wrek|Observiking> 05id ratehr enjoy some kind of mane6 in the NV universe for some reason or vice versa
<Vivix> Well, I read it pretty fast- it was captivating
<Jmo4267> That'd be something.
<TOY_PON3> Wrek|Observiking: Never bothered to read it. Not even once
<DoctoDoctorWho> thats about as bad as 40k
<Vivix> Well- I like it because equestria escalated into fallout universe, instead of suddenly being in the universe
<Vivix> We do get to learn the fate of the mane six during FoE though, it's- yeah some of it was pretty epic and sad
<[Alpha]> Don't want to know
<[Alpha]> refreshing now
<TheMaster> I just want to read about giant pony robots.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05my favorite crossover fics are jsut the kind that has a plausable reason why the main character of say a game or universe is suddenly in equestria or vice versa, becasue i enjoy reading how they deal with the conflicts that arise
<Jmo4267> lolgiantrobotponies
<Vivix> Mm- yeah that's a taste difference- 'cause that's what I usually avoid-
<TheMaster> like Timelords and Terror
<TheMaster> which I <3
<Jmo4267> Tiemlawds.
<DoctoDoctorWho> in the 40k one I read, slannesh, nurgle, khorne and tzeentch get bored of their universe and move to invade equestria
*Ponies47 Yawns
<Wrek|Observiking> 05daniel the wannabe timelord!
<Vivix> There was a fallou x mlp crossover where the lone wandered appeared in equestria, featured a few weeks ago
*Jmo4267 glomps Ponies47
<Wrek|Observiking> 05a great star trek spinoff :P
<Ponies47> Good morning everypony :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> mornin
<alexxm> how you doing Ponies47
<TOY_PON3> mornin ponibas
<Jmo4267> MEEEERNEEEENG
<TOY_PON3> Ponies47:
<TOY_PON3> xD
*Ponies47 Hugs Jmo4267 back
<TheMaster> Other then Tzeentch, who Celestia would fall to in about 5seconds. I don't think the chaos gods would find many followers in the mlp universe
<TOY_PON3> sorry!
<Dark92Enigma> brb.......gonna go to my mom´s house
<Ponies47> I'm good alexxm thank you :3
<TOY_PON3> Dark92Enigma: Take care
<TOY_PON3> Ponies47: What's up?
<Dark92Enigma> i'll be back in less than a half hour
<TheMaster> Though maybe pinkie would worship Slaneesh
<andy> hey guys
<Wrek|Observiking> 05another thing that id like to see is a deus ex crossover that isnt just adamn jensen is unexplaindly in equestria or suddenly the equestrian universe is filled with augments
<TheMaster> magitech
<Vivix> Like a slow escalation?
<Ponies47> Ohai TOY_PON3! It's been a while since I've seen you here! What's up with me? Nothing much really. How about you?
<DoctoDoctorWho> little sneak peak, luna kills a lord of change greater daemon with gravity
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but i guess that is what drives people to write right?
<[Alpha]> ahh turned off ipad as well
<TOY_PON3> Ponies47: Been good finally returned to Bronystate :3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05to get that crossover like they have imagined it
<Vivix> Do it wrek
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Vivix> most writers start when they can't find what they want
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i dont have the time or dedication to write something good
<Ponies47> TOY_PON3: IKR? :p
<TOY_PON3> ^^
<Vivix> Yeah-
<[Alpha]> I have the time and dedication just not the inspiration
<Vivix> I don't know the Deus Ex universe enouh to even attempt it
<Jmo4267> loldeusex
<Vivix> was a big fan of the first game, and enjoyed the human revolution a lot
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i would like to try write in ponies in the deus ex universe rather than the other way around
<Vivix> but-- don't know anything about the lore
<TheMaster> One of the better crossovers I ever say was the Mystara crossover
<TheMaster> and I didn't even know that particular pen and paper setting
<andy> whats mystara?
<DoctoDoctorWho> blood for the blood god
<[Alpha]> research Vivix
<Wrek|Observiking> 05casue theres nothing that even hints that any teleport or time equipment could transport someone from there
<Jmo4267> dis chat b alive nao
<TheMaster> its, as i've gathered, a setting for dnd type games
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so the only plausable way is some kind of anomaly
<Wrek|Observiking> 05which is ratehr weak already
<Vivix> I always prefer universe x pony instead of character x pony
<DoctoDoctorWho> skulls for the skull throne
<Jmo4267> Blood for the blood god.
<TheMaster> but someone from spacebattles wrote a 600,000 or so word fanfic with ponies in it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its much more plausable say twilight teleport gone wrong
<Vivix> if you kno what I mean
<TheMaster> and it was prettygood
<Vivix> That's true
<DoctoDoctorWho> long live khorne, chaos god of blood, war and slaughter
<Jmo4267> KILLL, KILLLLLLLL!
<[Alpha]> True but they always fall on that
<TheMaster> wrek. someone actually did a dues ex crossover
<Wrek|Observiking> 05blood for the blood god
<TheMaster> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DeusExEquineRevolution
<Vivix> I think FoE is the onl crossover I'll read, because I'm such a screaming fanboy over the Fallout universe, and don't recognize any of the other crossovers
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but its the wrong kind of crossover
<Wrek|Observiking> 05which is why i didnt enjoy it
<DoctoDoctorWho> and to hell with those slannesh worshiping hippy pussies
<RainBowJack1> so close Phase4
<Kandarihu> The boss here drops the best staff in the game.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05it suffers the same thign as the FO:E fic
<Wrek|Observiking> 05whic h i dont like
<[Alpha]> I really do enkoy fallout but I can't bear to read something that kills the purity like that
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and that is that the "real" equestiran universe turns into this mix of both
<Vivix> that's the part that I enjoy- so yeah-
<andy> "real"
<TheMaster> canon, if you prefer
<DoctoDoctorWho> dakka dakka dakka
<Vivix> sort of , yeah, that it developes into it, withou ever including actual characters from the other series
<Wrek|Observiking> 05aye its a taste matter
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but so far
<Vivix> yeah,
<Wrek|Observiking> 05an NV or deus ex crossover the way i like em hasnt been made
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and the attempts are poor at best
<DoctoDoctorWho> what are we even watching?
<TheMaster> I tried getting into FOE but found it a little repetitive plotwise
<Vivix> Did you check ou the newest fallou crossover? but it was lonewanderer appers in Equestria- I didn't read it
<Vivix> Aww-
<Wrek|Observiking> 05now that sounds interesting
<Wrek|Observiking> 05casue i realllllllly like the lone wanterer dlc
<Vivix> It just catered to everything that I love, so I fell in love with the series
<DoctoDoctorWho> what are we even watching?
<TheMaster> its not really IC or anything. It really jumps the gun on getting lone wanderer meeting the cast
<Vivix> I don't know if it was based on the DLC, or if it was just the generic player char name, but it was on feature list a few weeks ago
<TheMaster> falls into the traps usual 'x meets ponies' does
<[Alpha]> ...
<Vivix> Aah
<TheMaster> also the wanderer is loaded down with ridiculous gear
<Vivix> hehe
<andy> its hard to write about a charachter that is different for everyone who plays the game
<DoctoDoctorWho> seriously though, what is this?
<andy> magicka
<TheMaster> ^
<Vivix> Writing the PC is hard, because every player tends to play it differently, whcih is why I prefer PC to be turned into an OC
<Phase4> 00,02well that was fun
<LightTrooper105> good game Phase4
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho: Magicka
<TheMaster> I usually play as a charismatic pacifist in fallout sort of games
<Vivix> Good stream, man
<Wrek|Observiking> 05think you coudl locate it for me Vivix?
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek|Observiking, streams free
<Vivix> I can try, just a sec
<DoctoDoctorWho> cool, never heard of it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05it liek to see if it fits my needs
<Kandarihu> Phase4, thanks for streaming.
<[Alpha]> he my needs
<TheMaster> I just wish cardslafter would finish through the eyes of another, rather then do his rewrite
<Ponies47> Internet derp back
<Vivix> Of course, Fimfiction changed to google search, so half the hits are "story does not exist"
<TheMaster> its killing me
<Vivix> Thanks knighty!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05TheMaster: when i talked to him lastly he is really taking time to devise the continuation
<TheMaster> excellent, I eagerly await it then.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05in the meantime reqriting the old chapters in between
<TheMaster> Shit got so real, and I wanted to know how it ended
<Wrek|Observiking> 05becasue hsi writing has improved a shitload since he began
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ive read the 2 new chapters already and so far
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its a bit strange and some thign needs to be worked out
<TheMaster> I suppose thats fair enough. He is one of about 3-4 fanfic writers that have made me laugh aloud
<Jmo4267> derpmoment
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but they are proving to live up to the first 15 chaprers
<Phase4> 00,02LightTrooper105, was good game :)
<Wrek|Observiking> 05now i have 3 episodes left on the star trek disc i have in the dvd drive
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so im first planning on playign those
<Flyboy> awww... i missed about half of he magicka run...
<TheMaster> woo
<Wrek|Observiking> 05then i will play either NV or something else
<andy> i see infinite streams
<TheMaster> what do you have?
<TheMaster> Do you have vampire: the masqerade bloodlines?
<Jmo4267> lolNV
<TOY_PON3> Okay I'm back! >:3
*Jmo4267 glomps TOY_PON3
*Wrek|Observiking slaps Jmo4267 around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo4267> WHY A TROUT.
<TOY_PON3> Wrek|Observiking: You hit me too T-T
<TheMaster> why not?
<Jmo4267> I prefer tuna.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05because you said "lolNV" which is very idiotic unless you plan to explain further what you mean
<Jmo4267> I'm not hating on it or anything.
<TOY_PON3> Gonna stay out of this one o_o
<Wrek|Observiking> 05then stop saying things that makes it look like you do
<Vivix> Wrek http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14895/Wayward-Courier found it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05thanks
<Vivix> I haven't read it, but it's got good ratings
<TOY_PON3> So anything on Stream atm?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05in a minute TOY_PON3 ^_^
<TOY_PON3> okay ^^
<TheMaster> Wrek, what sort of games do you own that are streamable?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05my stream library is ratehr wide
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i tend to play the more RPG style games
<Wrek|Observiking> 05say skyrim or fallout
<Vivix> I keep reading your name like Observo King
<TheMaster> Do you have Vampire?
<TOY_PON3> lol
<Wrek|Observiking> 05nope
<TheMaster> shame. Hm.
<TOY_PON3> I wanna get Skyrim on PC sooo badly :/
<Vivix> Is the original fallou streamable? I know overlay does not work on it
<TheMaster> the chat would be way too small to see
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Did you get the Fallout Bundle they recently had?
<Vivix> I've had it for years
<Vivix> so- I had it from beforehand
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Vivix: sadly the old fallout games suffers the same error that ceasar 3 does
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: o_o Oh cool
<DoctoDoctorWho> WOOT 4 desktop ponies!
<Vivix> Aww-
<TheMaster> Ceasar 3 <3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ie for windowed mode you need to set your monitor to 16bit truecolor
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and liek that the capper wont pick up the stream
<Vivix> me and my friend bought a copy of fallout 1 at the candy shop (that also sold cds) in like 1999?
<TheMaster> there will never be a city builder as cool as ceasar 3
<TOY_PON3> o-o
<Vivix> Ah.. too bad, they're great games. Not sure how fun they're to watch though
<Wrek|Observiking> 05probably not
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but i enjoyed playign them nonetheless
<Vivix> yeah-
<TOY_PON3> I feel like a kid now ._.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> we were like..I dunno..10?
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: What's your Steam username?
<TOY_PON3> I was about 5
<Vivix> Mivix, I think
<TOY_PON3> idk
<TheMaster> alien nazis? those don't look like Daleks
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i played my first game at the age of 3 and that was doom, proves my age
<Vivix> Hehehe
<TheMaster> doom <3
<TheMaster> do you have doom 3?
<Vivix> I wasn't allowed to play Wolfenstein, but I was allowed to play Doom
<Wrek|Observiking> 05eeyup
<Wrek|Observiking> 05own all doom games
<Wrek|Observiking> 05even the lsot levels cahpters
<TheMaster> I've always thought Doom 3 > Half Life 2
<Vivix> Nice
<Vivix> Do you use doomsday when playing them?
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Is your avatar Chrysalis?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05if i want to sue mods i use zdoom since it tends to work better
<Vivix> I kinda liked Hexen and Heretic too
<Vivix> Yes, it is
<Wrek|Observiking> 05otehrwise i use doomsday
<TOY_PON3> Cool
<Vivix> Ah yeah
<TOY_PON3> dat Hitler o_o
<TheMaster> Germany + America? Oh dear. this looks like a job for The Doctor
<Flyboy> oh my...
<Vivix> In the thirties, before everyone found out Hitler was bad
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Vivix: i love doom soo much though
<MadSurge> Wrek|Observiking: I played arcade games with my dad because I was too little to play them properly, at the age of 2 :D
<Vivix> Yeahh- it was one of my first action game loves
<Flyboy> England will never fall for such HERESY!
<TOY_PON3> I gotta buy Doom sometime =_=
<Wrek|Observiking> 05beat doom 1 and 2 adn the TNT WADS on ultraviolence without strafing
<TheMaster> HERESY?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05even did it on stream
<Vivix> Niice
<Wrek|Observiking> 05fuck it was hard but worth it :D
<Vivix> I was never GOOD at it, hehe
<TOY_PON3> x
<TOY_PON3> xD*
<Wrek|Observiking> 05then we have my ABUSE streams
<Wrek|Observiking> 05if youve seen one of those
<Vivix> Ii think I've seen one
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you havent seen me die in a game unless youve seen me stream abuse
<Vivix> hehe
<MadSurge> Wrek|Observiking: where the game proves its namesake :D
<Vivix> was that the... oh god memory.. original bungee jump teams..old game?
<TOY_PON3> Sorry for being SUPER random, but I don't know why I love toast :3
<MadSurge> Vivix: you're thinking of Marathon
<TheMaster> Alien nazis, really, he hasn't even said EXTERMINATE once.
<TheMaster> i'm beginning to think that isn't a dalek at all
<Wrek|Observiking> 05abuse was their first sidescroller game
<Vivix> Hmm- wrek linked me to it and I dwonloaded it, but I can't remember if it was abuse
<Wrek|Observiking> 05published by bungie
<Vivix> Ooh, no then I haven't seen that
<Wrek|Observiking> 05developed by crack dot com
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the marathon series however
<Wrek|Observiking> 05is my childhood in a nutshell
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i fucking loved those games
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I mostly played--Doom, heretic and.. duke nukem 3d
<Wrek|Observiking> 05like i have no greater nostalgia trip than when i play that
<TheMaster> the nazis were assholes and all but damn did they have good uniforms
<TheMaster> can't beat that SS black
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i agree
<TOY_PON3> ^
<RaveBrony> Woah, what have i missed? :o
<Vivix> The nazi high command was obsessed with style and appearance, including architect to build castles and such
<TheMaster> also they liked Norse mythology
<Flyboy> i think one word can describe this episode. DISCOOOORD!
<Vivix> and it..shows
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i was toying with the "what if" america allied with the germans against the russians
<TOY_PON3> If something happens to the Nazis, I blame Fegelien
<Vivix> ah yeah
<alexxm> wow the enterprise looks pretty beaten up
<Wrek|Observiking> 05also i stripped the whole erradicate the jews thign they had going
<andy> russia would be in trouble
<TheMaster> twilight sure has gotten popular down there
<Vivix> Ah yeah
<TheMaster> and yet she doesnt even notice. that must be a good book
<Wrek|Observiking> 05they fall asleep while she read them a story
<Wrek|Observiking> 05fell*
<Wrek|Observiking> 05then she kept reading to herself
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, everyone
<TheMaster> you know who can save america from the foreign invader from across the sea? The Wolverines
<Wrek|Observiking> 05dash dropped in wantign to borrow a new darign do book but got stuck listening
<TOY_PON3> morning AttacktheAndalite
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and filly celestia and luna are there casue a spell mishappened and twi is takign care of them untill it wears off
<Wrek|Observiking> 05cause its cute as fuck
<Vivix> hehehe
<alexxm> how you doing AttacktheAndalite
<TheMaster> I nearly had a heart attack, I agree
<Saturn> 08,01wheee
<Saturn> 08,01i'm at work \o/
<Saturn> 08,01and stuff is actualyl workin
<Vivix> Hello workhorse
<Wrek|Observiking> 05btw saturn
<AttacktheAndalite> alexxm, I'm fine. Just waking up
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i shaved today
<Sylandest> Saturn: yay~
<TOY_PON3> hi Saturn
*AttacktheAndalite hugs TOY_PON3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05an hour later my acne almost dissapeared xD
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello, Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01also, i got my bass guitar today \o/
*TOY_PON3 hugs AttacktheAndalite back
<Wrek|Observiking> 05feeks great maaan
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek|Observiking: that's awesome!
<Vivix> what did you get?
<AndroUser> Hello guys 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01but... i like stubble...
<TOY_PON3> hey AndroUser
<TheMaster> you'd think the nazis would be having a mental breakdown trying to fit aliens into their master race ideology
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek|Observiking: are you going to be clean-shaven at BUCK?
<TheMaster> then again I think only hitler and a few SS really were into that nonsense
<Wrek|Observiking> 05depends on what you mean with clean shaving >:3
<TOY_PON3> TheMaster: Maybe the Aryans were Aliens o_o
<Wrek|Observiking> 05facially yes
<Saturn> 08,01ha!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the rest could use a trim but not cleanly shaved
<TheMaster> Aryans from the future?
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Saturn> 08,01indeed
<Saturn> 08,01shaving in that manner makes for itchiness
<TheMaster> wait. he's in grey now? Is he in the SS or the Wermacht?
<Wrek|Observiking> 052 different aliens
<TOY_PON3> creepy
<alexxm> what just happened
<Saturn> 08,01records being added to the db... i like this, this is good
<TheMaster> that quick thing of history made my brain hurt
<Chrysalis> all the database
<andy> they really thought this through
*AttacktheAndalite yawns sleepily
<Saturn> 08,01what are you watching?
*TOY_PON3 pets AttacktheAndalite's head
<Saturn> 08,01more star trek?
<Vivix> Star Trek
<TheMaster> so they shot lenin....and that stopped the russia revolution
<Wrek|Observiking> 05S4E2
<Saturn> 08,01oooh!
<andy> it sounds probable
<TOY_PON3> AttacktheAndalite: Go to bed ^^
<Saturn> 08,01nice
<Vivix> Saturn, what bass did you get?
<Saturn> 08,01i wish i could watch, but i'm working
<TheMaster> then why didn't russia stay allied with france and britain anyway?
<Saturn> 08,01and i don't actually have a graphical display
<AttacktheAndalite> TOY_PON3, I just woke up. It's almost 11AM for me
*Saturn 08,01is going all terminal today
<TOY_PON3> AttacktheAndalite: o_o
<TheMaster> it wouldn't have changed the problem. and only the ussr would work with the germans during the period of 1919-19...ah forget it
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: Washburn AB10
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well TheMaster
<Vivix> Ah, nice. I need an accoustic- I got..8 electrics
<Wrek|Observiking> 05mayeb stalin didnt egt to the power
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and his totaliarism wasnt as pushed
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so the alliance to beat the germans maybe never took place
<TOY_PON3> o-o
<Wrek|Observiking> 05henceforth the germasn had free roam in that area
<TOY_PON3> My mind is blown
<Vivix> I can't remember all the prewar preperations
<Wrek|Observiking> 05as logn as they could hold the dead zone
<andy> it showed on the map earlier that they had taken part of the us
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so maybe stalin didnt rose to power after lenin
<TheMaster> they said they killed lenin in 1916
<Wrek|Observiking> 05or how it was im a bit fduzzy on the russian side of WW2 history
<Vivix> I think..Germany used russia to build things that could be easily converted into weapons and tanks during pre war
<TheMaster> ^ yes. and free roam to train and learn doctrine
<Vivix> I don't know what their alliance was based on-
<Vivix> yes-
<TheMaster> it was based on both countries being international pariahs
<RainBowJack> is he waring a SS suite?
<Vivix> Ahh
<TheMaster> Yes. He's apparently in the SS
<NullRadix> ... didn't we just do this plot, in reverse?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05stalin always wanted to capture the baltics and hold his totalitarian empire
<Wrek|Observiking> 05withotu those plans in the russians back head
<RainBowJack> i have that Amblem he has the skull
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its actually plasuable that the alliance never happened
<Vivix> So russia stayed a tzar empire?
<TheMaster> I'm saying that if lenin was killed in 1916 then the revolution doesn't happen in the first place.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well lenin was murdered
<TheMaster> then russia doesn't break up at all
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but not by stalin
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well
<Wrek|Observiking> 05stalin wasnt able to take power afterwards
<Wrek|Observiking> 05which may be why thigns went as they did
<Vivix> Wel lwell- maybe the ugly guy aint evil-
<Vivix> yeah-
<andy> naw the ugly guy is always evil
<Vivix> hehe
<TOY_PON3> xD
<TheMaster> Stalin didn't singehandedly make the ussr what it was. Infact, having done a paper on it the industrial supergrowth of russia in the 1930s is sort of a myth.
<TheMaster> they just nationalized it all
<alexxm> the enterprise looks pretty beaten up
<Wrek|Observiking> 05please enlighten me
<TOY_PON3> not sure if sarcasm lol
<TheMaster> Well after the russian revolution and the civil war the bolsheviks didn't know how to run their country. They actually used capitalism to get it back on track
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so without stalin to nationalize it
<TheMaster> called it the NEP (new economic policy) it actually worked amazingly well. Until Stalin became angry at the ukranian Kulaks who were unhappy with the use of their grain to fund heavy industry.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05maybe they stayed capitalistic?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05wrong term
<Wrek|Observiking> 05maybe the NEP didnt break up the same way
<Vivix> yeah-
<TheMaster> Well without lenin at all I don't know if the revolution would of even happened.
<TheMaster> The menshiviks and the bolsheviks were convinced that russia wasn't even close to an actual revolution.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05actualyl yeah
<TheMaster> until lenin showed up and told them that they needed to seize control now
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so without lenin
<Wrek|Observiking> 05no revolution
<TheMaster> then its just tzarist russia. which would have been allied to france and britain
<TheMaster> which would have been a two front war for germany.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but tzar russia has no reason to ally with them
<Vivix> Hmmm...
<TOY_PON3> well I'll brb gonna play some Terraria
<Wrek|Observiking> 05thats why stalin allied in the first place
<Vivix> Weren't they traditionally allied?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05to reclaim parts of europe
<TheMaster> They allied after Wilhelm II was stupid enough to let the treaty of Berlin to expire
<TheMaster> so Russia and France allied
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i jsut want to point out that we are discussing theoretical history
<TheMaster> indeed
<Vivix> When the Tzar was overthrown, didn't the supporters and others escape to..france and britain?
<TheMaster> aliens giving nazis super tech sort of throws that out the window anyway
<Vivix> I don't know the history between those countries
<Wrek|Observiking> 05why would russia be allied to france in the first place?
<TheMaster> Nicholas II stayed because he thought that he could control the situation
<TheMaster> by the time that the bolsheviks captured him and his family it was too late
<Vivix> Ah yes..
<TheMaster> well russia was traditionally allied with prussia. but after Otto von Bismarck was fired by Kaiser Wilhelm II the Kaiser let the non aggresion pact between germany and russia expire
<TheMaster> with no allied, russia allied france who hated germany
<TheMaster> allies*
<Vivix> Aah-
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and sicne the first history change was 1916
<Wrek|Observiking> 05that still happened
<Vivix> And prussia ceased to exist in WW2 right?
<TheMaster> also. Germany had allied Austria who had interests in yugoslavia and many slavic regions.
<TheMaster> so russia didn't like that
<TheMaster> Prussia formed into germany in 1870
<Vivix> that early? hm
<TheMaster> after the Franco-Prussian war. Bismarck managed to crush france
<Wrek|Observiking> 05btw i love our discussion :D
<Vivix> Hehe
<TheMaster> =is a history major
<Vivix> I love history- I aint good at it, but still love it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05as is my dad, im basing my asumptiosn on the small thigns ive picked up :D
<TheMaster> well feel free to ask
<TheMaster> I've had my fair share of european history. It tends to be a popular subject
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so since the first historical change was 1916
<Wrek|Observiking> 05by then WW1 had already ended?
<Vivix> 1914, right?
<TheMaster> well 1918 is when ww1 ended
<TheMaster> 1914 is the start date
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ok so
<Vivix> 11:00, 11/11
<Vivix> oh right
*Sylandest is taking notes of this discussion
<TheMaster> The russian revolution occured in 1917 and they dropped out of the war
<TheMaster> Lenin was in exile in switzerland
<TheMaster> and the germans transported him (in a sealed train car, they were that afraid of his abilities so he wasn't allowed to talk to any german workers)
<Wrek|Observiking> 05biut since he would be murdered in 1916, what events would not occur that turned the war as it did?
<TheMaster> the russian revolution doesn't happen, even if the sailors in petersburg and the workers revolt. Maybe the Tsar is still forced to give voting abilities and the formation of the Duma.
<TheMaster> Uh, its tricky since its such a volitatile period. I guess anything could have happened
<TheMaster> Lenin was important but its not like noone else could have done it.
<Vivix> True-
<Wrek|Observiking> 05depends on if a new tzar if one was even appointed wanted thigns to stay as the ywere i suppose
<TheMaster> Well Nicholas II wasn't about to die anytime soon. His son had severe hemophilia though.
<Vivix> Did he have a son? I can't remember
<TheMaster> So theres that.
<Vivix> Ah-
<TheMaster> Yes. Alexsi had hemophilia. thats where Rasputin comes in
<CountDoofus> Heroes?
<TheMaster> Star Trek
<TheMaster> But The tsar had a brother. I guess he might have been able to be tsar if his son had died
<TheMaster> and they'd had female leaders before. Maybe Nicholas' daughters could have become tsarinas
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but yeah somehow france and all of wentern europe fell to the nazis.
<Vivix> By the time Germany started using Russia to .. build their vehicles and avoid those rules, the revolution had happened?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05russia didnt do anythign about it or they did but it didnt change eanything
<Wrek|Observiking> 05hitler began invading the US
<TheMaster> The Weimar Republic didn't waste any time getting programs in germany. So yes.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and thats were we are at now
<TheMaster> Which is fine for Star Trek
<TheMaster> its even a semi-credible reason. more then "aliens gave them super weapons"
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well they had to develop the weapons from ground up
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so as it is right now
<Wrek|Observiking> 05they have some prototypes and 1 or 2 divisions
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but its not like the aliesn have trusted the germans with it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05not in vast numbers
<DoctoDoctorWho> one would think that they would have won with alien super weapons
<DoctoDoctorWho> but they didnt, proving that theory wrong with its own insane logic
<RaveBrony> Can anypony help me out with Terraria info??
<Vivix> I always found it crazy that Germany was trying to develop nuclear weapons-
<TheMaster> What was crazy was that their numbers were so wrong
<Vivix> hhehe, I never researched it-
<Wrek|Observiking> 05werent the germans close to them anyways?
<TheMaster> they thought they needed waaaay more enriched uranium then you actually need
<Vivix> I remember that eh- the H3O facility in norway was bombed, and the ship with h3o was also bombed
<Vivix> Aah
<TheMaster> Yes. Plenty of sabotage and bombing
<TheMaster> it never really went anywhere
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well norway was never invaded in a sense
<Wrek|Observiking> 05correct me if im wrong its a story i heard
<Vivix> the first movie that came out of Tungtvannsfabrikken, the h3o faclity that was bombed, dont remember name, had some of the original saboteurs acting as themselves
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but some nazis jsut started marching in oslo and thats when the goverment said fuck it we lost
<Vivix> Mm- we were invaded, but it was over in like 3 days
<Booth> dat bullet wound
<Wrek|Observiking> 05cant recall precisley
<Vivix> there was a shootout at..the kings hunting lodge
<Vivix> but yeah I think they just paniced--
<TheMaster> The nazis did invade norway fully and took it over very quickly
<TheMaster> no help from britain either
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well brittain were serving their own itnerest at the time
<Vivix> They helped us later- luckily
<Vivix> yeah
<Wrek|Observiking> 05again gotta say themaster, realyl enjoyign the conversation :P
<TheMaster> Well i'm glad. I always do like to show off what I know
<Vivix> I think the reason we got hit pretty hard that way was because of the suitable position to--stop supply lines by boat
<Eulshy> Whats on?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the US/brits wanted to bomb the kiruna mines aswell to stop the flow of iron from sweden to germany
<Vivix> Oh wow
<Wrek|Observiking> 05which would bring us to the war aswell
<TheMaster> wow. enterprise looks like crap
<Vivix> that woulda been a disaster- you guys were neutral thrughout yeah?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05while the germans wanted to bomb us cause they were afraid that we would side with the brits/US
<Wrek|Observiking> 05we said neutral though
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well
<Wrek|Observiking> 05not we didnt
<Wrek|Observiking> 05we awere very deceptful
<TheMaster> i'm suprised the enterprise isn't wiping out those slow prop planes
<Vivix> I know it was a risk going to sweden- beacuse some of the guards could turn you into the SS, and most wouldn't
<Wrek|Observiking> 05what kept the germans on our side was the allowande of out raintracks and oru ore
<Vivix> Well, guys- I have to BBL, gonna go with my dad and pick up his new car. Cya guys soon!
<Eulshy> Ima take a guess and say this is some sci fi show
<TheMaster> Star Trek
<DoctoDoctorWho> random question: is the whole "save derpy" war still going on or has the fandom dropped it by now?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05what kept os on the brits side atleast was the information we hadned form the german comm network
<Eulshy> Ah
<Vivix> Great convo guys! /poof
<RainBowJack> dat Qaintem leap
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you going away Vivix?
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<Ponies47> Hey Lil_B :)
<CountDoofus> Haio Lil_B
<RainBowJack> he almost reminds me of Q
<TheMaster> something about his dad
<Wrek|Observiking> 05for isntance, we told them that germanny was enmassign to attack the east front
*Lil_B hugs Ponies47 and CountDoofus
<DoctoDoctorWho> did anyone answer my question?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05they didnt beleave us of course
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but then they finally did
*Ponies47 Hugs Lil_B back
<Wrek|Observiking> 05we said "todl you so"
<TheMaster> What question, Doctor?
<DoctoDoctorWho> is the whole "save derpy" war still going on or has the fandom dropped it by now?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05as for that question DoctoDoctorWho, i never cared for and foudn the whole ordeal silly and immature
*CountDoofus is awkward with hugging, but fine with internet hugs and returns the hug to Lil_B
<TheMaster> I think it stopped when the hub kept showing the episodes unchanged?
<TheMaster> I think only itunes changed it
<RainBowJack> wassent the enterprice damaged?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeah
<TheMaster> As cool as it was I found the whole thing troubling because of the levels of fan acknowledgement
<TheMaster> next thing you know they'll be a little dark blue alicorn called Nyx on the show
<RainBowJack> TheMaster : Q is Still best Chara
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i can accept that some fans were angry about the change
<Lil_B> I didn't even understand what was going on with that derpy "controversy" until 3 month later or so XD
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but takign it to the extent they did was wrong
<DoctoDoctorWho> so is it still going on?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05same thign with those emailing and saying derpy was an insult
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the fuckers need a smack across the head
<Wrek|Observiking> 05humasn eh?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05humans*
<Lil_B> what a real audience :/
<RainBowJack> Wrek this is the Story befor Kirk right?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yes
<TheMaster> I could sort of see why someone might say "woah guys, why does a character sound like they do actually have a mental condition" even if it was tabitha thinking derpy was a guy.
<TheMaster> more of a case of doing your homework
<RainBowJack> DAT CGI
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the CGi is fantastic for its time
<RainBowJack> indeed
<andy> when was this made?
<RainBowJack> 2002?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05first scene was made 2001
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so say tech from 2001-2003
<andy> yea
<Wrek|Observiking> 05made adn rendered 2004
<Zawan> how many trek episodes have already streamed today?
<Wrek|Observiking> 051
<DoctoDoctorWho> I just find it wrong that they are attacking something even when they are the only people who care
<Lil_B> at first I thought people were mad because they thought the voice was strange XD
<sonicandmario85> good morning everypony :3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05well the fan voice was high pitched and cute
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so i can see that
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but understand that there are people we are talkign about
<Wrek|Observiking> 05cant expect the mto act rationally
<sonicandmario85> wrek are you streaming again?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and think before they speak
<Wrek|Observiking> 05sonicandmario85: yea finishing this DVD before i do some gaming
<RaveBrony> Hey Wrek, can i pm you a random question?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05can alwasy try
<DoctoDoctorWho> what effect do you think it would have on the community if a prominent world leader claimed to be a brony?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i would think that people would take it too far
<Wrek|Observiking> 05like they always do
<NullRadix> isn't "taking it too far" half of what defines the community?
<DoctoDoctorWho> like good bad or what/
<Wrek|Observiking> 05it would bring good and bad things
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but in the end
<Wrek|Observiking> 0590% would not give a shit
<Wrek|Observiking> 05those that do are the noisy few
<TheMaster> I understood both sides of the argument and found it alltogether a bit silly.
<TheMaster> or atleast, the lengths they went
<TheMaster> I just hope they don't go quite so far to do fan-service for us. I didn't start enjoying the show because they did nods like that afterall
<TheMaster> it'd be like if Pinkie started offering cupcakes to her friends and they all suddenly looked uneasy about it.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i find it funyn now and then with references liek that and little fan service here and there
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but it all leads down to
<Wrek|Observiking> 05takign it too far
<DoctoDoctorWho> I always thought that it would be a great boost if not the outright "final push" for the brony community in this "war" against society
<TheMaster> Little things are great.
<TheMaster> Like the Big Lebowski reference
<andy> oh yes
<TheMaster> I loved that
<andy> the big lebowski reference is my favorite mlp reference
<andy> that movie is amazing
<Wrek|Observiking> 05this war against society is not as big as you think
<Wrek|Observiking> 05frankly
<Wrek|Observiking> 05most of the shit i hear comes form the US
<TheMaster> its just a bunch of people posting angrily on twitter
<TheMaster> which amounts to...nothing
<Wrek|Observiking> 05here in sweden for isntance the bronies i know and talk to have never had a problem
<Wrek|Observiking> 05sure there is always atwat that trolls
<andy> whatkind of problems do bronies have with society anyway?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05thats what coutnertrollign is for
<sonicandmario85> FLAME WARS ARE STUPID
<DoctoDoctorWho> Its more the problems that society has with bronies
<TheMaster> i assume they're mad at howard stern now?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05andy there are a few incidents for isntance trhe 15/16 year old being thrown out
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and some suicide attempts
<TheMaster> 15/16 year old?
<TheMaster> wuit
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yes
<andy> i see
<Wrek|Observiking> 05was thrown out by the overly strict and religiosu mother
<andy> thats just sad
<Wrek|Observiking> 05was basically isntantly allowed to couch at a nearby bronys house
<Lil_B> I normaly just shut up about MLP, when nobody wants to talk about it or even knows it, than there is no point for me introducing it to them (except for close friends)
<MirrorImage> that's not a brony issue, that's a religion issue
<Wrek|Observiking> 05EXACTLY
<sonicandmario85> im lucky my mom actually loves me and wont throw me out whenever im 15 or 16 or whatever
<Wrek|Observiking> 05which is why the war on society that DoctoDoctorWho mentions is blown out of proportion
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and no its not a religion issue
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its a fundamentalist issue
<TheMaster> I think most people in the community are a little overly sensitive. considering the brony fanbases origins...
<TheMaster> you should be ready for the worst the internet has to offer
<DoctoDoctorWho> we origonated in 4chan, thats like getting an order of paladins forged in hell
<RainBowJack> Wrek do you have a Q epi?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05not today
<Wrek|Observiking> 05as for originating from 4chan
<MirrorImage> DoctoDoctorWho - an order of paladins, forged and tempered in hell and dedicated to the greater good
<RainBowJack> aahh to bad :(
<Wrek|Observiking> 05keep in mind that the community was small back then
<Wrek|Observiking> 05now
<TheMaster> heh. I actually was there for the begining.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05many have joined that doesnt even know of the place
<TheMaster> Oh the good old days on /co/
<Chrysalis> the community has expanded massivly from its origins
<Chrysalis> and is pretty unrecognisable from its roots
<andy> it must have been interesting to see it develop
<Chrysalis> minus its focus
<sonicandmario85> just because im a brony doesnt mean my mom will throw me out when im older she loves me
<TheMaster> I began in episode...3? I think
<sonicandmario85> im lucky XD
<TheMaster> Was a lot of fun.
<Lil_B> I have never been to 4Chan... (except for one time for about 1min to see how it actually looks like)
<TheMaster> watching my little pony by candlelight
<TheMaster> and you had to walk 50 miles in the snow
<sonicandmario85> i never at all been to 4chan
<TheMaster> uphill both ways
<Wrek|Observiking> 05became a brony about soon 1½ years ago
<sonicandmario85> TIME TO GO LOOK FOR THE WEBSITE FCHAN
<Wrek|Observiking> 05season 1 had alreayd aired
<sonicandmario85> 4chan*
<TheMaster> its not so bad. But then again i have no soul
<MirrorImage> first summer brony, wrek?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05not really
<Striker> its hot over here
<andy> i became a brony about the time the season 2 finished
<Wrek|Observiking> 05bumped itn othe fandom on MMOchap about a month before that
<andy> just starting to settle with the community
<Wrek|Observiking> 05broguht some episodes with me on vacation
<Lil_B> I think I'm pretty much at the 1 year point now, maybe 1 or 2 weeks aver it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05was without internet durign that time
<Wrek|Observiking> 05came back and became more familliar with the community post summer
<Wrek|Observiking> 05joined bronsytate around that time
<DoctoDoctorWho> my bronydom began a few months ago
<andy> thats recent
<RainBowJack> i love this Community
<andy> i was actually introduced by a friend through bronystate
<Zawan> i think mine began s2e2
<alexxm> i became a brony last summer
<DoctoDoctorWho> I learned more about the community and its history in that time than I thought possible
<RainBowJack> when i became a brony was late december 2010
<Striker> I became a brony Valentines day
<Barbetos> Yeah. Season 2 really got me into the brony community too. I watch all of season 1 and did not care to get any more invovled beyound that.
<Barbetos> Morning btw.
<Striker> on*
<RainBowJack> and joind Bronystate at S2 e 9 Last round up
<Eulshy> Ima play TF2 now, bye ponies!!
<Barbetos> Bye. glhf
<Striker> BYE!!
<andy> in the beginning i had resolved to just watch all the episodes and not become a part of the community. that proved to be pretty impossible
<DoctoDoctorWho> has anyone seen hasbro's new map of equestria yet?
<pony_7007> my 1 year aniversery is this month
<andy> DoctoDoctorWho: link?
<Lil_B> yeah, I was interrested in MLP, but really a FAN of MLP I became when I joined Bronystate (way too late) at s2 e20 or so
<DoctoDoctorWho> http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=equestria#/d59w4iv
<DoctoDoctorWho> its canon!
<andy> your saying hasbro made it?
<Lil_B> I got the Hi-Res Pictures :)
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yaaaaay human prejudice!
<Lil_B> yes, they are Posters from Wall-Mart
<Wrek|Observiking> 05this is what i like about this show aswell
<DoctoDoctorWho> yes they did
<andy> racism at its worst
<Wrek|Observiking> 05it really shows that society is trying to evolve beyond what it is
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but how much of a struggle it is
<Lil_B> wut?
<Lil_B> can he explode?
<Boodfire> Glorious!
<DoctoDoctorWho> twice?
<Barbetos> What did he do?
<MirrorImage> Lil_B - PufferMan
<Barbetos> I missed it
<Striker> Why does hae to be so hot Texas!!
<Striker> *have
<MirrorImage> Barbetos - he inflated his face like a puffer fish, basically
<Barbetos> Striker ikr
<Barbetos> Oh
<DoctoDoctorWho> so what do u guys think of the map?
<Striker> Awesome
<TheMaster> looks cool enough. Very much looks like the united states
<TheMaster> except canterlot is put in the middle
<andy> i like it
<andy> they have niagra falls on there
<TheMaster> neighagra falls you mean
<andy> yea
<TheMaster> apparently cadence is canadian.
<TheMaster> which makes sense
<andy> i get the feeling some of these places wil be used in season 3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05frozen north
<NullRadix> there are igloos on the map
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i think i'd like it there
<Lil_B> is this east or west of Azeroth?
<Striker> i want get in those igloos!!
<TheMaster> its south of panda island
<TheMaster> For a political nerd such as myself, i'm sort of curious if they'll ever explain how the equestrian government actually works
*Striker puts a bag of ice on his head
<TheMaster> like if Celestia and Luna are just absolute monarchs or what
<sonicandmario85> i found 4chan god theres alot of pony posts there XD
<DoctoDoctorWho> its a monarchy
<TheMaster> ...which board did you go to?
<ACS13123> O hai
<sonicandmario85> the pony one
<TheMaster> its actually a diarchy but
<Striker> I WILL NEVER GO TO 4CHAN!!
<TheMaster> not all monarchys are the same. Like Britain has a parliament
<andy> does 4chan still have a pony section?
<MirrorImage> TheMaster - Britain isn't *really* a Monarchy at this point...
<DoctoDoctorWho> yes
<Striker> yup
<Lil_B> I like the Pony section on memebase :)
<Wrek|Observiking> 05im guess more socialistic ratehr than kommunistic
<TheMaster> But they do have a Monarch. Thats what I mean. Like if Celestia and Luna are absolute monarchs, Louis the 18th style
<eleanorawesome> Yes you do
<DoctoDoctorWho> ponies, ponies everywhere.
<andy> so ponychan is like an adaptation close to 4chan but removed from it?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05d*
<alexxm> obvious green screen is obvious
<Lil_B> she reminds me of Lara Croft kinda XD
<TheMaster> its a seperate image board
<TheMaster> there are a lot of *chans out there
<TheMaster> most of them worse then 4chan
<sonicandmario85> i have desktop ponies on right now xD rainbow dash is flying around on the task bar
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but few as popular and diverse
<TheMaster> 420, 7, 789
<andy> i heard that 4chan has some pretty bad flame wars
<TheMaster> its a wretched hive of scum and villany
<andy> :D
<TheMaster> which is why I like it so much
<DoctoDoctorWho> the great pony war was among the worst
<Wrek|Observiking> 054chan is a pract example of the dickward theory
<TheMaster> just don't go to /b/ if you value your sanity and soul
<sonicandmario85> derpys just standing there thinking about muffins
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Wrek|Observiking> 05dickwad*
<sonicandmario85> HELLO
<andy> theMaster: now i have to check it out
<Striker> Has anyone read "on a cross and arrow"?
<Serenity> Wrek|Observiking: Couldn't agree moar
<DoctoDoctorWho> I dont mind it, I gave up on sanity awhile ago
<andy> my thoughts exactly
<Serenity> I gave up on sanity when I started watching this wierd show about talking horses
<Striker> I`m a seal
<Striker> :P
<MirrorImage> Serenity - you watched Mr. Ed too?!
<Serenity> MirrorImage: Mabye...:3
<Striker> cupcakes anyone?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Leave. Now.
<Serenity> No thanks, I'm more of a fairycake fan
<andy> i've been wondering whether i should read that just to see what its all about
<Wrek|Observiking> 05andy it would do more harm than good
<andy> that bad?
<Serenity> Yep
<MirrorImage> ehhh....
<TheMaster> well don't say I didn't warn you
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its jsut a gore story that sets out to gross. nothing more. its bad
<Striker> who wants muffins then?
<MirrorImage> walking into it blindly, yes it's bad
<TheMaster> there was really only one part of cupcakes I found wince worthy
<MirrorImage> if you've heard plenty of it, it's rather meh
<DoctoDoctorWho> pinkie pie becomes a serial killer, thats all you need to know.
<TheMaster> other then that, meh, i've read and seen worse
*Striker hands everyone muffins
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its jsut a bad story, poorly writen etc
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but enough of this
<Wrek|Observiking> 05________________________________________
<MirrorImage> Have at thee?
<TheMaster> hah
<andy> yay pagebreak
<TheMaster> I liked that Mirror
<TheMaster> I thought that as well
<Striker> :P
<TheMaster> Your words are as empty as your soul, mankind ill needs a pony such as you
<DoctoDoctorWho> FREEDOM!!*Charges something*
<TheMaster> what is a man, a miserable pile of fandom.
<andy> dat cgi
<Striker> MY SKITTLES!!
<NullRadix> Striker: fwiw, I read "On a Cross and Arrow" and enjoyed it. I'm not necessarily picky though
<Lasharus> Do mine eyes deceive me, or art thou waxing lyrical, good sir TheMaster?
<Lil_B> TheMaster But enought Talk! HAVE AT YOU!
<TheMaster> It was more a reference but I can be quite lyrical
<Barbetos> Anyone want in on a pug highlander match of TF2?
<Barbetos> Need hwguys
<DoctoDoctorWho> FOR GLORY!!
<Lasharus> Referential lyricism doth still please mine intellectual side.
<Serenity> I can't, El shitbox can't run TF2
<Lasharus> Okay, enough Shakespearean.
<Striker> FOR THE EMPIRE!!
<sonicandmario85> rainbow dash and trixie are walking around the screen XD
<Striker> where
<sonicandmario85> on mine
<sonicandmario85> im using desktop ponies
<Striker> oh
<TheMaster> I'm trying to think of a good shakespeare quote to ponify
<NullRadix> "To pony or not to pony. Are you serious?"
<Serenity> A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!
<TheMaster> there you go
<TheMaster> Henry IV
<Serenity> Thank me later, now shush
<MirrorImage> Serenity - "But Sire, we are here."
<Lasharus> Heh, it's been a bit too long since I last read Shakespeare. I just adore Shakespearean English.
<Striker> I would like to see a ponifed version lotr
<DoctoDoctorWho> Art thou prone to anger, male sibling?
<CountDoofus> Buhbai for now, everybrony.
<DoctoDoctorWho> farewell count
<Wrek|Observiking> 05TheMaster http://wreky.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=48#/d484wg6
<Lil_B> TheMaster Watch the Ponys for it is knell, summons to heaven ot to hell
<TheMaster> excellent!
<Lasharus> Didst thou just make a feeble attempt at humourlessly passing off a saddeningly derivative joke in an intellectual fashion, e'er marring said intellects with the banality of thine statement, DoctoDoctorWho?
<Alister> DoctoDoctorWho: I have to deny your flase accusations , your attempts at angering me were pointless you savage ogre
<DoctoDoctorWho> aye
<Alister> false*
<Lasharus> At least the response is succinct. :P
<pony_7007> Wrek: did you ever finish that picture of the robotic rarity?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i never got past the leather coat
<Wrek|Observiking> 05couldnt get ir right
<Wrek|Observiking> 05it*
<pony_7007> awwwww
<DoctoDoctorWho> What an enthralling and yet low temperatured tale, male sibling.
<pony_7007> i really liked the eyes
<Lasharus> My sensibilities find themselves offended at thine persistent references to these plebeian sayings, DoctoDoctorWho.
<Zanon> Heya everypony!
<Buytoast> are they still fighting the nazis?
<Zanon> Hi there Wrek! I see theres more star trek!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Buytoast: nah it was sorted

<TheMaster> Methinks the Lasharus protest too much
<Zanon> yay
<TheMaster> doth protest too much*
<TheMaster> can't even quote a simple sentence. I suck
<Zanon> im not complaining XD
<Zawan> awesome mom
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back...........what are we watching?.........i left because i felt a little blue
<MirrorImage> Dark92Enigma - star trek enterprise
<Striker> star trek
<Derpy_at_work> hello
<DoctoDoctorWho> when one finds themselves offended at humorous actions, unpleasurable things begin to emerge in a most unreasonable fasion. similar to what happened with the infamous derpy" incident. be warned at where you lay your rage brother.
<Dark92Enigma> Oh NOW I remember :)
<andy> vulcans have wierd weddings
<Wrek|Observiking> 05andy: one could say the same about human weddings
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its a matter of perspective

<Striker> how many discs are there
<DoctoDoctorWho> sparkle sparkle sparkle?
<Wrek|Observiking> 0524 eps a season 4 per fisc
<Lasharus> I think thou wouldst find that I am not enraged, merely mildly put off by the low-brow simplicity of such statements. Thou shalt not find me angered by thee, merely mildly vexed. Should I have given cause for offense, however, I profusely apologise, having not intended such an unfortunate end result of mine statements.
<Dark92Enigma> Whoever said this theme is like ''Full House'' in space, he's right.........it's epic
<andy> any plans as to the gaming you were talking about earlier wrek?
<Lasharus> And now, I think I'm done with this, because my brain's too tired for this. :P
<Buytoast> told ou
<Lasharus> Back to normal English.

<Lasharus> Can't hold a candle to the first, but it was decent.

<Midnight_Splendor> Woah earthquake
<Lasharus> It sounds like the intro theme to a 60s series.
<MirrorImage> Lasharus - to a To Be Continued episode, yes

<Lil_B> wrek had some heavy streaming duty this week XD
<TOY_PON3> Oh yeah?
<Lil_B> I haven't seen anyone else streaming :/ (except maybe at 5 am or so )
<killerpony7733> Well wrek is one of the few that can stream during very late/early morning for the US and EU
<TOY_PON3> Yeah
<killerpony7733> And somewhere around work hours for the EU
<Lil_B> I know, but it's evening, scoot, sumica nittani... they all normaly stream at tthis time too as far as I can recall
<Space_Striker> \m/
<TOY_PON3> I need to be here more often
<TOY_PON3> Also I love that Twilight Sparkle background
<killerpony7733> TOY_PON3: I'm here 7 days in every week hehe

<TOY_PON3> killerpony7733: Nice xD

<Bronysith> is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? NO says the man from washington, it belongs to the poor. NO says the man from the vatican, it belongs to god. NO says the man from moscow, it belongs to everyone
<BronyInstrumental> Eli: how would i do a show of my musical stuffs?
<pony_7007> how many episodes does star trek have?
<Space_Striker> more than star wars

*Flyboy stares at Space_Striker 's hug cannon with a technique learnt from fluttershy
<Space_Striker> moo
<Lil_B> Vordox I made tiny Pixel version of an N64 for the SB64 animation, I had my N64 laying biside me as an Model to get the angle right XD
<Vordox> Lil_B: Smart drawing ;)
<Eli> BronyInstrumental: i have friends in the metal sceene, they have 90% of their face covered by hair :) who am I to judge?
<BronyInstrumental> Eli: you're half correct in that being the reason i cover my face with hair. i AM a metalhead, but i cover my face for my own reasons
<Lil_B> Vordox currentl trying to draw him sitting down, I have wreks spite sitting down to have an example
<Vordox> So plagiarising my sprites.
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> Ish coo'
<Space_Striker> bbs
<TOY_PON3> k
<Eli> BronyInstrumental: i have a skin condition on my arms, and for that reason i keep them covered too. whatever your reasons are, i just hope your music is good :)
<Lil_B> Vordox not plagiarism -.- inspirating :3 I try really hard to not just recolor yours XD
<Vordox> You can if you want to, just edit it :P
<BronyInstrumental> Eli: if i work hard it will be. i'll give ya a hint, it's a cover of an infamous song by a popular brony musician
<Lil_B> Vordox no, I wanna learn to make them >.<
<TOY_PON3> Mandopony?
<Vordox> =3 Good
*Space_Striker puts chocolae pudding hat on
<Eli> BronyInstrumental: Party HARD
<Space_Striker> moo
<Space_Striker> yogurt vs pudding
<Lil_B> I don't know how... but somehow I configured the Moog Plugin in a way that it onli swings in one direction of the middle :/
<Eli> Is Space_Striker the same person as Striker? because you're the same in terms of randomness
<Space_Striker> yes:3
<Eli> who would have guessed...
<alexxm> this song pleases me

<Eli> alexxm: it's basically jsut listening to a song from Rick whatshisface
<TOY_PON3> Rick Astley
<Eli> ^
<alexxm> Eli i know what rickrolling is i just wondered how you could do it to yourself
<Lil_B> hey, the Turrican Kickstarter has finally an update again ... was about time -.-
<TOY_PON3> He never asked for this bro
<alexxm> the desus ex game thats more robocop than anything
<Eli> i turn on Andrew W.K. or I fight dragons. or Rick himself
<CriticKitten> Wang's office.
<Alister> Is he going for the Zero Factory achievement ?
<CriticKitten> First name Deep.
<CriticKitten> Dr. Deep Wang. :|
<TOY_PON3> :D
<Alister> Is he going for the Zero Factory achievement ?
<Lil_B> CriticKitten with his Brother Long
<Alister> Is he going for the Factory Zero achievement ?
<Alister> Yes , please ignore me
<TOY_PON3> Ok :3
<Alister> -_-
<TOY_PON3> I dont know man
<TOY_PON3> xD
*Lil_B ignores Alister because he asked for it
<alexxm> she doesn't really move naturally does she
<Lil_B> the chair looks like a face
<Alister> Lil_B: You don't get to say that , I'm one of the biggest Deus Ex fans. It's me who says that
<CriticKitten> Lil_B: His sister's named Lykez.
<Alister> so who is streaming ?
<TOY_PON3> Wrek is
<Lil_B> CriticKitten I just made a bad pun XD Long Wang
<TOY_PON3> Lykez Wang
<TOY_PON3> :D
<Lil_B> oh, looks like I didn't get the pun -.-
<Alister> Wrek might capable of the achievement
<Alister> be*
<Alister> nvm, he took the wrong door
<CriticKitten> Lil_B: Father was named Short, after a character in his parents' favorite movie: Temple of Doom.
<CriticKitten> I could probably keep this up, too.
<TOY_PON3> Mother's name is Nu
<CriticKitten> NINJA
<TOY_PON3> :3
<Lil_B> Ninja.... releoad when spotted and try again
<Alister> watch out , that guard will turn back while walking
<Alister> I played this game too much
<TOY_PON3> Seems like it
<TOY_PON3> fuuuuu
<CriticKitten> Anamoly reading in Sector 2B....wait....not 2B....
<Alister> Quick load ? wish I had that on the PS3 , would save a lot of time
<Obsidian> Hello everypony
<Alister> Wrek|Observiking: You gotta go by the right door , wiat for the two guards leave the corridor , pass under the camera and enter the door at the end of the hallway
<TOY_PON3> hey Obsidian
<Flyboy> what we playing and who's streaming?
<TOY_PON3> Deus Ex Human Revolution and Wrek is streaming
<alexxm> how you doing Obsidian
<TOY_PON3> damn so close
<Obsidian> Alright I guess alexxm
<Vordox> Whose playing Deus Ex?
<TOY_PON3> Wrek is
<Obsidian> Which part of the story is this?
<Alister> Just go by the right door !
<Alister> Obsidian: The DLC
<Alister> Obsidian: Mssing link
<Obsidian> okay
<Vordox> Wrek: I expect Pro skills now :P
*Lil_B is kinda away again
<TOY_PON3> whoa
<Alister> finally
<Cyborg_Striker> I am now a Cyborg
<Alister> not there
<Cyborg_Striker> fail
<CriticKitten> Beer!
<Cyborg_Striker> WHERE
<CriticKitten> Whoops.
<MASF123> What's this I hear about the new upcoming Skyrim DLC being a rip-off?
<TOY_PON3> bastard has low ammo
<Flyboy> enough is ENOUGH! I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERF*CKIN' SOLDIERS ON MY MOTHERF*CKIN' GAME. Strap yourselves in. Its time to crack some skulls...
<TOY_PON3> How can Dawnguard be a rip off?
<Alister> Cyborg_Striker: Oh nothing , Wrek can play his own style. It's just that I developed a route to sneak by without having to kill any guard or using equipement
<CriticKitten> MASF123: It's not worth $20.
<MASF123> ok
<CriticKitten> Wait for the price to go down.
<alexxm> sneaky jenson
<Vivix> I'm back, ya'll
<TOY_PON3> CriticKitten: Can you explain to me why
<BronyInstrumental> i'm back guys
<TOY_PON3> Welcome back you two
<Cyborg_Striker> CYBORGS ARE AWESOME
<CriticKitten> Nice.
<Vivix> Thanks
<Alister> I wish I could tell him where to go
<TOY_PON3> np
<CriticKitten> TOY_PON3: The amount of content is significantly limited for $20.
<MASF123> Will Slender be played anytime soon? The Stream Derped when someone was playing it.
<Flyboy> BOOM! shit just got real...
<TOY_PON3> CriticKitten: Oh okay
<Vivix> most games cost 49 bucks, I haven't checked out Dawnguard at all, so I don't know what's included-
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: I kinda seen a preview but not sure if it's all cut out to be
<CriticKitten> Have to consider that for the price of Dawnguard alone, you can buy a full copy of TL2 or a number of other games.
<CriticKitten> So for that price, it's a bit much.
<Vivix> I haven't heard any hype eihter- so all I know is "crossbows!"
<TOY_PON3> ^
<TOY_PON3> Seriously though if I had a choice to be a vampire or a vampire hunter. I'd be a hunter
<Vivix> True- it's proably going to drop in price later, might pick it up then
<CriticKitten> That's....pretty much the thing worth hyping. XD
<Vivix> I played a vampire in Oblivion- wasn't fun because people you bit never turned
<TOY_PON3> Oh and the new dragon armor too
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: I'm always a wolf ;)
<CriticKitten> The vamp lord and were changes are (from what I hear from my friends who bought it) still not very useful.
<Vivix> !
<Vivix> Aah
<TOY_PON3> Maybe if Dawnguard went down about 5 bucks then it would be worth it
<Vivix> I like skyrim- buuuut..
<Vivix> I don't feel it is as free as.. lets say NV
<Vivix> I'm imperial, and I can't attack stormcloak camps because 1/3 of the npc's are immortal
<Vivix> in NV, I in an excruciatingly long and fun battle, killed Ceasar
<TOY_PON3> I played NV, loved it
<CriticKitten> Well as I see it, that's a copy of TL2 or a small update to a game I've already got tired of. Not much of a choice. :P
<Cyborg_Striker> h:P
<Vivix> Yeah- NV was great, I don't get the whole set.essential thing Bethesda does
<Vivix> and why I can't join the dragons and doom everything
<TOY_PON3> lol
<Vivix> It wouldn't be a GOOD choice for me, but I would choose it if I could
<Vivix> In NV you can make all the wrong choices and die lonely and friendless
<TOY_PON3> It's like that one Skyrim joke. We're related Dragon so why not take over the world together?! >:3
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Well, true, but reading the history on the way up to hrothgar just made me-
<Vivix> Nooot want to help the blades, not fight Alduin-
<Vivix> Alduin is a horrible jerk, but- so where the ones you are almost forced to side with
<CriticKitten> That guy's like "dun feel like turning around lul"
<Vivix> I just wanted to join the munks-
*Cyborg_Striker puts chocolate pudding hat on
<TOY_PON3> Yeah
<Vivix> When you're sick of Skyrim, abandon all quests and turn off the compass. It's awesome to just explore
<CriticKitten> And this is why I can't do stealth games/missions.
<MASF123> But it's not even 4:0 a.m. in the morning, why on earth are you making chocolate pudding?
<TOY_PON3> Yeah or kill some villagers >:3
<Vivix> hehe
<CriticKitten> Skyrim's set up in such a way that you can't just wanton kill everything.
<CriticKitten> And everyone
<Vivix> yeah- true
<XylemTube> Is this black light? looks like black light
<MASF123> Bountys
<TOY_PON3> unfortunately true
<CriticKitten> Which is admittedly disappointing since, if I get sick of somebody and want to cut them down, I'd like them to not be invincible.
<killerpony7733> Wrek|Observiking: There was some ammo crates back there
<Flyboy> i think that voice in the bacground is playing kerbal space program
<Vivix> Totally critic
<Vivix> that's one of my cons against Skyrim
<MASF123> There's a mod on PC that lets you kill little kids in Skyrim
<Barbetos> And I am back. This the missing link?
<TOY_PON3> Some Nords just want to watch the world burn
<Vivix> how in NV you can kill EVERYONE, and in Skyrim I can't even kill the guys out to kill me
<CriticKitten> The freedom is significantly reduced in Skyrim from its prior titles, where you COULD kill everyone (you'd just be theoretically screwed is all(
<CriticKitten> *)
<TOY_PON3> NV I disregard human life and kill everything in site
<Vivix> Yeahh, like Morrowind
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> I almost never massmurder in games
<Vivix> but in Fallout I tend to shoot ghouls
<Barbetos> Vivix your play style maybe? I have to CONSTANTLY run from fights with my skyrim character on expert. Its a little annoying but eh.
<MASF123> Why can't they just spawn in a few minutes just like in Red Dead Redemption?
<CriticKitten> I don't either, but I want to be able to blast lightning at dudes for looking at me funny if I get that urge.
<Barbetos> I never really played NV even though I own it though
<Barbetos> So I could be wrong
<Vivix> yeah, same here
<TOY_PON3> The scorpions scare me ._.
<Vivix> wait what?
<Vivix> I tend to shy away from fights in fallout
<Vivix> I usually play diplomatic and sneaky
<Barbetos> ^
<Barbetos> Same
<killerpony7733> The worst is deathclaws
<Vivix> but--I can attack everyone if I want to or need to
<TOY_PON3> In NV when you come across those radioactive scorpions they're huge and chase after you
<Vivix> Hehe yeah
<Barbetos> In Skyrim I use a lot of raise dead and enrage abilities.
<MASF123> In Red Dead you can kill almost anyone, they'll just spawn later even the store owners do
<Barbetos> I make other things do the fighting for me
<Vivix> Skyrim I'm an archer and explorer, mostly
<Barbetos> Its entertaining to boot
<TOY_PON3> I love starting fights in Red Dead :D
<MASF123> Makes robbing a general store more fun
<Vivix> hehe, true
<Vivix> In Mafia 2 I rob stores
<Vivix> so I can mod cars--
<TOY_PON3> Games like those we love breaking the law x3
<Flyboy> Vivix: same here
<Vivix> But yeah, it's great to have freedom in RPG games
<MASF123> I need the achievement of startong a fight in every bar in the game
<MASF123> starting
<TOY_PON3> Indeed it is
<Vivix> because even small limitations will feel like a punch to the face-
<Barbetos> Vivix just get in the habbit of using and/or carrying scrolls that will otherwise enrage, paralyze, calm, and raise dead. It helps a TON. Thats why mage is so viable in Skyrim
<Barbetos> Mage is easy mode
<Vivix> Oh yeah-
<CriticKitten> I pretty much run around shooting lightning at things in Skyrim.
<Vivix> I'll try that- I'm doing okay with my archery atm, but I still have trouble against Wisps and such
<Flyboy> why is he taking crates with him?
<TOY_PON3> I shoot fireballs
<Vivix> I collect shouts ;3
<TOY_PON3> Same
<killerpony7733> Flyboy: To climb things
<MASF123> I can pick up crates
<Flyboy> ok?
<BronyInstrumental> i headshot everything with arrows
<Lunac> Duex Ex?
<MASF123> yeah
<Vivix> I've gotten ot that level now, I can barely attack Dragons though
<BronyInstrumental> enchanted with the enchantment that lets it hit ghosts and stuff
<TOY_PON3> I tend to shout at goats when I'm on mountains XD
<Cyborg_Striker> I shoot everything in the knee
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> I love goats-
<Barbetos> Archery would be awesome if you could use it alone to do all your killing, but it simply is not that good. Atleast I have not had luck with it.
<Vivix> I tend to attack hunters, if they attack deer and stuff
<TOY_PON3> Yeah
<MASF123> Ponyborn :[
*Vivix huge deer fan
<Barbetos> lol
<Barbetos> Poor hunters
<Vivix> ;__;
<TOY_PON3> I hate coming across those crazy guys that just want to kill you I make sure they suffer :3
<Cyborg_Striker> Mmmm... deer
<Barbetos> Guess the have it coming though
*Vivix cries and hugs deer
<Serenity> Hey everypont
*MASF123 has eaten a deer before
<Serenity> Pony*
*MASF123 in real life
<TOY_PON3> I would never ear deer
<Vivix> Yeah- I've eaten deer too, not after I grew up though
<TOY_PON3> eat*
<Serenity> Sumica playing Duesex? :3
<Barbetos> MASF123 Deer is delicious.
<TOY_PON3> No Wrek is
<killerpony7733> Serenity: Nope wrek
<Serenity> Hmm, okay
<MASF123> Barbetos it's taste like chiken kind of
<MASF123> chicken
<Serenity> No DTP, so couldn't tell
<Flyboy> i hate crates...
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Barbetos> Vivix You know Deer hang around my house through out the day. They just chill in my neighborhood.
<Serenity> I'll be damned.
<Vivix> Aww, so cute
<MASF123> I admit I was grossed out at first, but, it doesn't taste bad.
<Vivix> We got some around here, but I just moved here
<Barbetos> Actually the deer here like to troll XD
<Vivix> Hehe
<TOY_PON3> I'm honestly afraid to pet a dear, they might kick me and stomp on me ._.
<Vivix> Deer caan be a bit spooky
<Vivix> I've never touched a deer, and I'm kinda scared of wild animals
<Serenity> TOY_PON3: Deer aren't usually hostile
<Flyboy> am i the only one in engladn, where dear mostly stay away from towns?
<MASF123> Deers can be killed by cars, that makes them weaklings.
<TOY_PON3> Serenity: Really?
<Serenity> Bucks on the other hand, are fuckers
<Barbetos> So one of my neighbors has these deer statues right? One of the fuckers decided to stand right next to one perfectly still. I did not notice her for the longest time XD
<BronyInstrumental> Flyboy: naw
<killerpony7733> Horses are more scary as they have a kick that can kill you
<Vivix> hehehe
<TOY_PON3> True
<Vivix> Yeah horses can kill, but they're usually nice
<Serenity> Also, stags are quite hostile too
<Vivix> My sister got kicked by her horse-
<TOY_PON3> Unless you hurt them
<Serenity> But deer are pretty harmless
<TOY_PON3> They will fight back
<Cyborg_Striker> I found a deer trying to hide in my tall grass
<MASF123> Horse can trample you to death. Lol.
<Vivix> Deer can kill dogs and stuff
<Serenity> Cyborg_Striker: Pokkymans
<Barbetos> Cyborg_Striker get to pokeball.
<Vivix> Moose and Deer tend to kick dogs if they come too close
<Barbetos> get the*
<cachi01|mobile> Hello everypony :)
<TOY_PON3> I hate when deer hunters collect the heads of their kill and mount them on the walls
<MASF123> hi
<TOY_PON3> T-T
<Vivix> Helloo
<Serenity> They are like Francis: "I hate dogs" >:c
<Cyborg_Striker> sup

<Serenity> I dunno, makes a nice decoration
<TOY_PON3> lol Francis
<MASF123> TOY_PON3 why, it's a trophy
<Serenity> Slightly more humane than head of their enemy on the wall
<cachi01|mobile> Guys i saw a newborn spike o_o
<Serenity> You can't trophykill a man :/
<TOY_PON3> MASF123: I'm not into that stuff
<TOY_PON3> I'm a lover, not a fighter
<Vivix> Yeah- I just don't like it
<Vivix> I try not to---meddle in other peoples business
*Cyborg_Striker puts chocolate pudding hat on cachi01|mobile
<Serenity> So am I, but you don't see me complaining
<Vivix> but I would never allow a girlfriend or boyfriend to bring that into my house
<MASF123> TOY_PON3 taxadery is fine when they kill a baby kitten to make a stuffed animal.
<PillowPoni> The only place that I want a deer in my house is either in the oven, the plate, or my stomach
<TOY_PON3> MASF123: ;~; ...
<MASF123> taxadermy
*cachi01|mobile eats dat hat

<MASF123> My cat's name is Meneno, it's made up I think
<Vivix> Ah yeah
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: I realize Butters only cares for me since I am the one who feeds him :D
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Yeaah- but we still love em
<Cyborg_Striker> My cat ran away years ago :'(
<TOY_PON3> Eeyup

<killerpony7733> Cats are generally very loyal to the one feeding them
<TOY_PON3> :/ sorry bout that
<Vivix> My cat tends to come when I call for him
<Vivix> but..only if he can be bothered
<PillowPoni> If I ever get a cat, I'm gonna name it Pinkie if it's a girl;
<Serenity> Mine doesn't. Mine's a stupid bastard
<TOY_PON3> Well my cat completely ignoes me XD
<TOY_PON3> ignores*
<Vivix> Hehe
<PillowPoni> If it's a boy, I'll name him Pie. So I'll have Pinkie and Pie.
<TOY_PON3> He just stares and looks away ._.
<TOY_PON3> Neat
<Barbetos> Oh man. I just come back to jensen draging a body around. Oh man the luls
<Cyborg_Striker> my cousin`s cat is an asshole o me

<TOY_PON3> Serenity: Y U ASK HOW TO MASTERBATE CAT?
<TOY_PON3> :P jking

<Barbetos> Actually, I think Parker fro mthe original red faction does the whole body snatching thing better than Jensen XD
<TOY_PON3> o.O
<Cyborg_Striker> the monkey did it
<PillowPoni> Serenity, well if it's possible to do it to a dog then it's possible to do it to a cat. Now if it's a stuffed/toy cat, then.....
<TOY_PON3> Okay this just got weird
<XylemTube> that's not masturbation. It's manual sex
<Serenity> Because if you're talking about it, I want to know if it's actually humanly possible
*TOY_PON3 leaves thread :P
<Barbetos> He has the sense to drape dead bodies over his shoulder and move them around.
<Vivix> Almost all animals can be stimualted sexually by humans
<cachi01|mobile> And then the chat went bestiality

<TOY_PON3> What a TWIST!
<MegaMoonShine> :O
<MASF123> Did anyone play Slender yet?
<cachi01|mobile> Me
<Vivix> I heard someone did a stream on it here yeah
<MASF123> how was it?
<Kitten_Striker> Who turned me into a kitten?
<TOY_PON3> Oh man if my life was a M Night Shyamalan movie it be torture
<cachi01|mobile> I just got 1 note
<BronyJenkins> I compleded Slender...
<Vivix> I've never been on reddit, so I didn't think it was too scary-
<BronyInstrumental> slender aint scary
<cachi01|mobile> Its hard as fuck
<Vordox> so many blind guards.
<TOY_PON3> I haven't played Slender
<cratorkid> MASF123: yea, it has uses , but running around and picking up junk isnt practical, if you stck up and junk then it might be usefull, the junk that does high damage is heavy , and that weight eould be better used on ammo, it has its uses but i never had to use it
<cachi01|mobile> Not scary but hard
<Vivix> Don't you win just by not looking at him?
<Kitten_Striker> WHO TURNED ME INTO A KITTEN?!?!?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05brb
<TOY_PON3> k
<PTM_Soldier> I DID
<Kitten_Striker> :[
<cachi01|mobile> Vivix its kinda hard
<PTM_Soldier> with my Personal Twilight Minigun!]
<Vivix> I've only watched people play it-
<Vivix> my favourite play was actually by captain sparklez, because he's jumpier than Pewdie withou screaming
<cachi01|mobile> Vivix he is right behind you after note 6 so u cant turn around or else ded
<TOY_PON3> Wait is Slender a free game?
<MASF123> My Marine friend told me on FAcebook that you'll shit your food out and later eat more food to find out you shit your pants again
<Vivix> Ahh
<Vivix> Slender is free, yeah
<MASF123> after playing Slender
<TOY_PON3> Cool I need to download it
<Barbetos> Anyone here play CSGO?
<Vivix> Slender is only scary if you like the lore behind it or something-
<Kitten_Striker> I played slender in the middle of the night while playing Michael Myers Theme
<cachi01|mobile> Its already out?
<Vordox> Favourite weapon, Wrek?
<cachi01|mobile> I heard it was shit
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: I know a thing or two about Slender
<Kitten_Striker> it was scary as shit
<cratorkid> TOY_PON3: same
<Vivix> I've never heard about slender, before the game
<killerpony7733> Vivix: And the problem is when people like pewdiepie plays it and all people will play it to death and will go around and say ''dude play this game it's god damn scary'' and it gets the game boring and meh quickly with so many people playing it
<BronyJenkins> I dont get scared easily.
<Vivix> I personally found IT HURTS guy to be scarier, and eerily similar and older than Slender
<PillowPoni> I might download Slender....don't know if my computer can handle it. I think the second biggest thing on my hard drive is my music library, which I'm sure is probably 6GB by now
<Kitten_Striker> WHY AM I STILL A KITTEN!!
<cachi01|mobile> SLENDY FTW
<Vivix> true killerpony7733
<TOY_PON3> yeah pewdiepie isnt that great
<MASF123> rd!
<cachi01|mobile> now give me 20 dollars
<Vivix> I think my steam library is 250 gb, and my music..probalby 80?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05back
<cratorkid> TOY_PON3: i like robbaz more
<Vordox> Wrek! Favourite weapon!
<MASF123> Is it true the Slenderman is real?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05sniper
<Vivix> If anyone knows who It hurts guy is, you get a internet cookie
<PillowPoni> Vivix: Holy fuck...80GB of just MUSIC??! You must have at least 1TB or more of space
<TOY_PON3> cratorkid: I like uberhaxorus
<PillowPoni> Evening, Nittany_Discord~
<Vivix> I have 1Tb disk yeah
<Vordox> Wrek: Silenced, or Tranq, or special?
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: You have a laptop?
<StinkomanFan> MASF123, only if you believe he is
<Vivix> cheap 5400rpm, but it hasn't let me down yet
<cratorkid> TOY_PON3: i use to llove the creatures then stopped , they can just bget anoying

<Vivix> yeah, and all decades too-
<cratorkid> besides rap andy

<Vivix> I kiiinda like--eh Beck's rap
<Vivix> like Beck - Loser
<TOY_PON3> Except the new crap
<Vivix> but thats like sloppy white rap
<MASF123> depends it can't be mainstream
<TOY_PON3> That's a good song
<andy> depends wat kind it is i guess
<andy> the pop rap usually makes me cringe
<PillowPoni> I only like rap from bronies.
<Fish_Striker> Now I`m fish
<Vivix> yeah, pop rap is cringeworthy
<cachi01|mobile> I dont like rap
<cachi01|mobile> Of anything
<TOY_PON3> Pop Rap is crap
<Vivix> I am a sucker for organic and loud sounds
<Fish_Striker> EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!!
<andy> organioc
<MASF123> no
<Vivix> kinda why I don't listen to metal anymore-
<andy> organic*?
<MASF123> Twisted Metal
<TOY_PON3> I only listen to some metal
<Vivix> they've perfected distortion and production, it don't sound angry and alive to me anymore
<cachi01|mobile> The only rap i listen to is
<TOY_PON3> MASF123: that's an awesome game
<cachi01|mobile> EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY
<MASF123> yeah
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix you'd like 'the mortician's daughter' by black veil brides. awesome song
<MASF123> no Rap battles
<TOY_PON3> Screamo...is not music to me I'm sorry
<andy> epic rap battles are exactly what the name implies
<cachi01|mobile> Dafuq
<cachi01|mobile> ALL METAL IS MUSIC TOY
<Vivix> Maaybe- I'm extremely skeptical to most metal
<andy> is stream playing music?
<PillowPoni> I like 80s music, some of them.
<MASF123> they are being sarcastic which why they type it in Caps
<TOY_PON3> cachi01|mobile: Sorry not Screamo
<andy> because it sounds amazing
<Vivix> me too
<TOY_PON3> BOTDF nope
<cachi01|mobile> Yes it is
<TOY_PON3> :|
<Vivix> I did listen to screamo for a while, since they tended to use singlecoil guitars and more noisy chords
<andy> what is this?
<alexxm> nice violin music
<cachi01|mobile> What if i show you a metal bronu?
<andy> very nice
<TOY_PON3> I love this music
<Fish_Striker> I`m listening to rainbow factory by woodentoaster
<cachi01|mobile> Most of his songs are screano
<cachi01|mobile> Mo
<MASF123> AVAST Fluttershy's ASS
<Vivix> I only really listen to PinkiePieSwear of the bronies, but there's others I like
<XylemTube> CLEAR SKIES

<cachi01|mobile> PINKIEGUY FTW
<andy> appejack the engineer cover
<PillowPoni> sci is one of my favorite artists. His music is sorta....eh....how do I describe his music?
<Vivix> Thing is, I don't like too much humour in music-
<MASF123> Applejcak's FiM Theme
<TOY_PON3> I like Alex S
<MASF123> jack
<cachi01|mobile> Y U NO LISTEN TO PINKIE GUY?
<alexxm> i like most of the brony musicans
<Vivix> Dubstep never got noisy enough to me, I like some of it, but sometimes it's just noot.. disgusting enough
<BronyInstrumental> i'm partial to some you me at six
<MASF123> Party with Pinkie Pie and MLP FiM Theme glitched
<TOY_PON3> Skrillex is okay to me
<Vivix> You me at six, heard of them, they're pretty decent
<PillowPoni> then again, I'm sorta new to electronic music in general.
<MASF123> Reptile's Thme
<cachi01|mobile> Skrilles..... No
<cachi01|mobile> Just no
<TOY_PON3> Nope
<Vivix> I like electronic bands that don't use computers or samples live
<MASF123> DUBSTEP JUST NO
<cachi01|mobile> ^
<cachi01|mobile> Amen
<MASF123> Excpet ofr Skillex
<MegaMoonShine> Some dubstep is pretty good
<cratorkid> some dubstep is ok'
<andy> oh god stream music is so good
<Vivix> I do like some of omnippony because I love his voice slice, but yeah
<BronyInstrumental> one of my favourite bands i've discovered as of yet is escape the fate. they have a song called something. best frickin' name ever
<TOY_PON3> Okay whoever compares Skrillex to Michael Jackson, fuck him
<cachi01|mobile> XDD
<MASF123> i know
<Vivix> hehe
<MegaMoonShine> Who dafuq would make that comparison?
<cachi01|mobile> Both suck IMO
<TOY_PON3> Whoever compares One Direction to The Beatles, fuck him
<cachi01|mobile> Both suck imo
<alexxm> someone compared skrillex with michael jackson?\
*PillowPoni listens to Deadmau5 from time to time
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeah who dares to compare the musical marvel that is skrillex to a lowlife like michael jackosn
<TOY_PON3> cachi01|mobile: :|
<MASF123> I think Justin Bieber sucks :S
<Vivix> Don't compare bands negatively
<TOY_PON3> Wrek|Observiking: Ikr?
<cratorkid> ^
<PillowPoni> Wrek|Observiking, the indignity of it all
<Vivix> Honestly now, if something is popular it is popular for a reason
<MASF123> Wrek, you don't like MJ?
<Vivix> Ot
<TOY_PON3> True
<Vivix> It's not ofr me, but I don't care otherwise
<PillowPoni> Vivix, Michael Jackson worked hard to get where he was/is
<TOY_PON3> Meh
<Vivix> Of course, but I'm not a fan of his sound
<Vivix> all credit to him though, he deserved what he made
<TOY_PON3> Jackson 5 started his career
<MASF123> evem parasprites like MJ, and that's saying something
<lowfn> Ello everypony.
<MASF123> even
<MegaMoonShine> Ello lowfn :)
<cachi01|mobile> MJ sucks..... The only time i listen to one of his songs. Its a parody or a cover by alien ant farm
<cratorkid> hey lowfn
<TOY_PON3> If his dad hadn't pressured him into becoming a pop singer he would've never made music

<Spy_Striker> hey
<Vivix> it's a crime novel ish game
<Vivix> really damn good
<andy> cool
<andy> heh
<Vivix> AND you can skip the action if you don't like playing those parts
*Spy_Striker sneaks paat andy
<andy> anyone played heavy rain?
<Vivix> only seen it-
<Vordox> BEST CONVERSATION EVER
<StinkomanFan> "Tell me, do you remember Andy?" "No..."
<andy> totally
<Vivix> hehehe
<StinkomanFan> Y:Truth A:Doubt X: LIE
<StinkomanFan> *Doubt
<TOY_PON3> Did somepony say L.A. Noire?
<TOY_PON3> I want that game so badly! x3
<Vivix> X!
<Vivix> I have it on computer, but haven't palyed it yet
<Vivix> I used to borrow my sisters copy on Ps3
<Vivix> so I have played it a lot
<Vordox> <3 music
<StinkomanFan> "FUCK YOU LADY, YOU KNEW ANDY AND RAPED THE CORPSE! I GOT PROOF!"
*Vivix is listening to other music
<andy> its pretty sweet allright
<Vivix> what's he playing?
<cachi01|mobile> L.A noire is meh
<TOY_PON3> I wanted to buy it during Summer Steam Sale but I had some mishaps ^^'
<andy> wow
<andy> who raped me again?
<Vivix> aww
<StinkomanFan> And that's LA Noir
<TOY_PON3> Yeah but I'm patient :3
<cachi01|mobile> U have to guess if hello is true false or doubt
<StinkomanFan> Cole Phelps yelling at rtandom people for no reason
<twilight_sprinkle> teehee, womens volleyball
<Vivix> I think it's really worht it if you like crime shows of the old sort
<TOY_PON3> I love that type of stuff
<Vivix> I like the talking more than the action- but I wish you could just drive around for lulz more
<StinkomanFan> I like the Street cases
<TOY_PON3> That game is for me then
<StinkomanFan> Like MASKED GUNMAN
<Delos-X> Ah, DEUS EX... I still haven't completed that.
<StinkomanFan> I shot that dude in the Ass and he died of it
<Vivix> hehe
<cachi01|mobile> Lotsa translucent figures
<Chrysalis> ah deus ex
<Chrysalis> i enjoyed this game
<Vivix> I liked it too, but I hated the bosses
<StinkomanFan> Or THE SHOO-SHOO THEIVES. Shot 'em both in the head and they still call an ambulance
<Delos-X> Hmm.. I came on here, when season 3 releases, will it be livestreamed here?
<Vivix> they were made by square enix though- not whoever made deus ex
<Vivix> yeah
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Ion Storm made deus ex itself. And Eidos published i believe
<Canadian_Brony> Hello everypony. Deus Ex and awesome music. I <3 Bronystate.
<Chrysalis> yeah, could of lost the bosses and lost nothing from the game
<Vivix> yeah. but they outsourced the bosses
<Delos-X> Because with the rumors of them trying to take down season 3 vids, and me not being able to watch the hub, I'm hoping to find a livestream of the episodes.
<Vivix> they were made by square enix I think, therefore they don't follow the playstyle or aanything of the game
<killerpony7733> DX1 had bosses of sorts but they were all optional not a requirement to fight
<Vivix> They're always going to be taking down episodes from youtube, but it'll be streamed and stuff anyway, as usual
<MegaMoonShine> Hello Canadian_Brony :)
<Vivix> yeahh-
<Delos-X> Great, bookmarking this site for season 3 then.
<Canadian_Brony> Delos-X Bronystate will stream the S3 premiere when it's released. Currently, there's no release date
<Canadian_Brony> hi
<andy> so pumped for season 3
<Delos-X> Thanks, I was just wondering if there is. I know that due to there being 13 episodes, they will be able to produce seasons quicker, therefore giving shorter breaks.
<alexxm> how you doing Canadian_Brony
<Vivix> Aww Yeahh
<MegaMoonShine> Who isn't?
<andy> only 13 :(
<Delos-X> Less episodes = less waiting = more seasons.
<Vivix> well, sort of, 13 episodes was said to be "for a special reason"
<cachi01|mobile> Only 13 MADE BY OTHER STUDIO
<MadSurge> Hey Canadian_Brony!
<Vivix> and wil hinted that season 4 will be 22-26 again
<andy> arent seasons usually every year
<Vivix> even simpsons had a few 13 episode seasons
<StinkomanFan> Spoilers: It ends early because somepony dies
<Vivix> yeah seasons are once every tv season
<Vivix> usually fall - spring
<Canadian_Brony> alexxm not bad. I'm trying to conjure up something to drink for the MLP drinking game taht I can get cheap and in bulk.
<andy> so less episodes means more time between right?
<Canadian_Brony> currently, I've got nothin'
<Vivix> yes
<TOY_PON3> What if Gaben is director of season 3?
<Vivix> 13 episodes will make it a longer wait
<andy> that doesnt sound pleasant
<Vivix> but I wonder what the secret is
<Vivix> might be a movie or a tv special of some length
<andy> but i guess you cant rush these things
<killerpony7733> ViolaGrey|Drawing: And the episodes could be longer as of that result
<TOY_PON3> I'd rather not know
<Delos-X> longer wait for each season if theres less episodes? doesn't make sense.
<Vivix> yeah, this is normal in tv
<Vivix> it's normal Delos
<killerpony7733> Vivix: I mean't you not ViolaGrey|Drawing
<ViolaGrey|Drawing> killerpony7733: nice fail ping :P
<ViolaGrey|Drawing> xD
<Vivix> well, comedy is 22 minutes
<cachi01|mobile> TOY_PON3 Then episode 3 of season 3 would never release
<Vivix> we probably wont get longer than that
<TOY_PON3> If the finale is supposed to be epic it better blow my pants off
<TOY_PON3> btw hi ViolaGrey|Drawing
<ViolaGrey|Drawing> hay TOY_PON3 :P
<Vivix> but Wil said the 13 episodes is for a special reason, and that they are working on more seasons
<TOY_PON3> I know ^^
<Delos-X> I'm curious about the villain, the one 'leaked' from the quiz is apparently a possible villain.
<Vivix> I don't look at leaks
<TOY_PON3> All I look foward to in season 3 is the songs
<DoctoDoctorWho> k bronies, Im back
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix exactly. Shorter seasons doesn't mean a series is dying
<Vivix> yeaah
<TOY_PON3> ^
<MegaMoonShine> Wb DoctoDoctorWho :)
<Canadian_Brony> hi DoctoDoctorWho
<Vivix> and I mean everyone said Simpsons was dead s4 because original writer staff left
<TOY_PON3> Yeah
<Vivix> ofcourse I'm not saying we're getting 20 seasons, but I'm not worried
<andy> one of the longes running shows
<TOY_PON3> Each episode should be an hour long :/
<Canadian_Brony> the longest running sitcom ever
<Delos-X> 20 seasons would be awesome though.. XD
<Vivix> hehe, drama gets 40 minutes, we get 22
<TOY_PON3> xD
<Vivix> Oh yeahh, if they could keep the quality up- that would be amazing
<andy> as long as it doesnt descend into mediocrity
<Delos-X> Definately.
<MegaMoonShine> I doubt they'd be able to
<Canadian_Brony> "This hour has 22 Minutes"
<Vivix> do you know what a simpsons episode cost?
<Vivix> 750 000 dollar
<TOY_PON3> Even if FiM ends bronies will still make custom episodes so we have nothing to fear
<andy> damn
<Vivix> I wonder what MLp costs
<andy> idk
<Delos-X> I noticed a similarity between discord and chrysalis' defeat though..
<Vivix> think about that when you download things
<andy> could the fandom go on without the series?
<TOY_PON3> Yes
<Vivix> trekkies did
<Canadian_Brony> TOY_PON3 IKR? Just look at "Double Rainboom"
<Delos-X> they both underestimated them at the peak of their goal.
<andy> i think so too
<Canadian_Brony> andy of course
<TOY_PON3> Canadian_Brony: Exactly
<andy> but it would die a little
<Delos-X> I hope they don't do that again, it would be dissapointing.
<TOY_PON3> Seriously I could live without MLP, just my life won't be so happy and I wouldn't have met any of you :)
<andy> aww
<TOY_PON3> ;)
<andy> i agree
<Delos-X> /)
<TOY_PON3> (\
<Canadian_Brony> /)
<Delos-X> /)(\ :D
<Vivix> ./)
<TOY_PON3> bro hoofs for everypony!
<andy> yay
<Vivix> Yeaahh!
<TOY_PON3> (\
<Delos-X> Eeeyup.
<killerpony7733> TOY_PON3: And i doubt BS would go down one day. Look at how good it goes. BS would probably be around so can always hang out and watch stuff here in the future
<Canadian_Brony> hey, who's streaming?
<Vivix> I would be a fan even without the fandom I think-
<Vivix> I've always loved cartoons like MLP
<TOY_PON3> killerpony7733: Indeedy
<MegaMoonShine> wrek is streaming Canadian_Brony
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: Same here
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sorry lagged out 4 a sec, NOW Im back.
<Canadian_Brony> thx MegaMoonShine
<andy> missed epic brohoof session
<MegaMoonShine> Same, chat derped
<Eli> another? /)
<TOY_PON3> sure
<TOY_PON3> (
<MadSurge> Vivix: same :D
<TOY_PON3> (\
<Delos-X> I haven't got missing link, I haven't even completed the maing story XD
<DoctoDoctorWho> woot! (\
<Delos-X> main*
<Vivix> /)
<MegaMoonShine> (\
<DoctoDoctorWho> dont u mean mane?
<Delos-X> Thats when you're refering to the mane 6 characters.
<Canadian_Brony> main, mane, whatev
<Delos-X> And I'm talking about the main campaign for deus ex XD
<DoctoDoctorWho> usually u can use it whenever the word main comes into play
<Vivix> if you'd like, sure
<DoctoDoctorWho> it doesnt matter tho, to each his own.
<Canadian_Brony> just like how we say "Everypony"
<Eli> some guys ponifi their PC to replace every main with mane
<Delos-X> I prefer to use it when I'm reffering to the task, really. But oh well, its personal preferance.
<Delos-X> there is this thing for browsers that replaces all 'anyone' and stuff like that to the brony variant.
<Canadian_Brony> there is?
<DoctoDoctorWho> where?!?!
<Delos-X> yeah, I'll get a link quickly.
*Canadian_Brony squee
<andy> they have whole videos on how to ponify your pc
<Eli> personally, i think it's a bit over the top. but yeah, you can download it
<andy> or mac
*Vivix forgot all the notes while playing, suddenly skronknonknoise
<killerpony7733> Wrek|Observiking: Button under the desk with the screen
<Eli> or replace your programm icons :) i love the Spitfire/Firefox icon
<mrmaskpony> oh fancy whats playng there mate
<Delos-X> I belive its this: http://pterocorn.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/ponify.html
<MegaMoonShine> mrmaskpony: wrek is playing Deus Ex
<Canadian_Brony> hi mrmaskpony. Wrek is playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im getting my own computer soon, any suggestions? im just geting a gaming computer and Im planning on buying from alienware, any suggestions?
<mrmaskpony> okidokiloki
<Delos-X> Depends on what you're willing to spend, alienware PC's can get expensive.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I said suggestions twice,:P
<MegaMoonShine> Can you do that? :O
<Canadian_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho ]
<Canadian_Brony> sorry, I'm
<Canadian_Brony> using a laptop
<DoctoDoctorWho> lets just say money isnt an issue
<Canadian_Brony> THIS THING'S KEYBOARD SUCKS!!!!
<Delos-X> Oh, if that's really the case... hang on a sec.
<andy> well find the most expensive computer out there then
<Vivix> I'd say you spend around 15-1800
<DoctoDoctorWho> and I dont require mobility either
<Eli> that sound so "old movie evil guy" like :)
<Vivix> and buy it in parts, better warranties
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ikr
<Eli> money isn't an issue... just kill bond
<DoctoDoctorWho> Give me 1 billion dollars and Ill kill superman.
<Vivix> I say you just try to get a good factory set up
<Braviary> Hey bud, what's on?
<Vivix> no overclocked CPU or overclocked GPU
<Vivix> it's not worth it
<DoctoDoctorWho> thanks
<Canadian_Brony> hi Braviary. Wrek is playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution
<Vivix> I've never bought a finished PC, but I'm guessing Alienware lets you pick parts?
<Braviary> Ooh.
<NullRadix> if you can get a moderately sized SSD (not a HUGE one, you want it primarily for the OS + applications) go for it
<DoctoDoctorWho> I believe so
<Delos-X> If you're really not worried about price, try the aurora. I don't have any PC's but they seem to have good specs.
<Vivix> SSD can be good, but it's rumoured that it can randomly wipe itself
<Delos-X> I don't have any alienware PC's*
<Vivix> I run on a 5400 RPM disk, don't feel it's all that slow-
<Dark_Horst> i trust in good old harddisks
<Vivix> I bought it by accident, isntead of 7200rpm, didn't een notice
<Eli> Vivix is right buy parts. it's cheaper in the end, and most of the time it's better
<Dark_Horst> they have was more rooma nyway
<Bronysith> Wrek|Observiking: you pumped for dark souls pc edition?
<Dark_Horst> *way
<Vivix> and when in parts, you can keep upgrading without spending too much money, until your mobo is obsolete
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im scared to try prepare to die edition
<Canadian_Brony> I need a new computer. My current one won't play Steam games and will freeze every once in a while
<Vivix> sick-
<Ponies47> Moo ^.^
<cachi01|mobile> Ponify looks cool
<alexxm> so anyone get the news letter yet
<Canadian_Brony> hi Ponies47
<alexxm> sup Ponies47
<Canadian_Brony> alexxm not sure, haven't checked my e-mail today
<andy> what news letter are you talking about?
<Ponies47> Ohai Canadian_Brony :3
<NullRadix> parts or no parts is highly subjective imo. if you like building, and can more regularly buy upgrades, parts can be nice... but it can be a hassle and challenging too
<Ponies47> alexxm: Nothing much
<Vivix> true-
<cachi01|mobile> Hi ponies47 and dat SB entrance lol
<Vivix> if you're not comfortable handling parts, it might not be hte best idea
<Canadian_Brony> andy you can subscribe to the Bronystate newsletter. They tell you about upcoming events and what plays on movie nights
<DoctoDoctorWho> yeah Im not too good in that area of assembly
<andy> thats pretty cool
<Vivix> my dad was, and is, a nerd, so I grew up with it
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix same
<Vivix> even if I haven't really been a nerd in that way for quite a while, I can still build a computer on my own
<Canadian_Brony> well, somewhat
<NullRadix> and there's also the argument where "buying parts" still requires you to buy like MB, Processor, and a lesser extent Memory at the same time (maybe case too?). You need to make sure all your parts fit together...
<Canadian_Brony> he buit 5 computers
<Canadian_Brony> *built
<Emil> Deus Ex?
<Delos-X> Eeeyup.
<MegaMoonShine> Yes, Emil
<Vivix> yeah, but now adays thats much easier htan in the old days
<Emil> Okay.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Emil. Eeeyup. Human Revolution
<Vivix> I remember putting in ram in my computer and instantly just smelling burnt computer
<Vivix> we threw the ram in the freezer
<Emil> Canadian_Brony: Ponies attack?
<MegaMoonShine> lol Vivix
<Canadian_Brony> Emil lolz
<Vivix> I had 96mb ram!
<Delos-X> xD
<DoctoDoctorWho> then again I have a tendacy to be modest about myself
<Emil> You can actually drag bodies in this game? WOW.
<Emil> WIN.
<Canadian_Brony> apparantely
<Delos-X> Yeah, its also pretty fun to do takedowns on people.
<Emil> Owned, biatch.
<Chrysalis> emil you can do that in most modern games witha stealth element
<Emil> Friendship is magic B****.
<Delos-X> If the guy streaming is on this, I'd save the stun gun for the boss.
<Emil> Chrysalis: I guess.
<Vivix> I think he's doing a no kill achievement
<Vivix> so i guess all guns are saved for boss?
<cachi01|mobile> Emil so you are a mmmmmmm beyatch that doesnt like mmmmm bananas
<Delos-X> Well, stun gun is best on bosses in the campaign.
<DoctoDoctorWho> one time I wrote a poem 4 school, and at the end I just said "good enough" and handed it in. everyone kept likening it to dr seuss
<Delos-X> I don't know the boss for this.
<Chrysalis> Delos-X Wrek is currently streaming
<Canadian_Brony> ohai cachi01|mobile
<Emil> cachi01|mobile: I don't really know, I...
<Chrysalis> and as mods are the only ones who can stream, hes obviously in here :P
<cachi01|mobile> Emil WELL I KNOW WHERE YOU WONT.FIND ANY
<Delos-X> Ik, I was just wondering if he's reading this.
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<MegaMoonShine> Hey Serenity :)
<Delos-X> Hello serenity.
<Emil> cachi01|mobile: Oh please, no, help!
<cachi01|mobile> Emil ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNAAAAAAAAA BEYATCH
<andy> hey serenity
<Emil> lol
<cachi01|mobile> Lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> hai /Serenity
<cachi01|mobile> Hi canadian_brony :)
<alexxm> dinner back soon
<Emil> Ordered 2 pony t-shirts today.
<Canadian_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho my English 9 teacher read us doctor Seuse *spelling?* as part of our poetry unit
<Emil> So awesome.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Serenity
<Emil> Emil: lol
<Vivix> we never had any dr seuss
<Vivix> my only knowledge from him is via simpsons
<Vivix> of*
<Delos-X> If only my PC could run games like this.. :/
<Canadian_Brony> Emil nice! I have one and I'm waiting for my wristband to arrive
<cachi01|mobile> ^
<Emil> Canadian_Brony: Nice.
<Canadian_Brony> Delos-X I know that feel
<Delos-X> So, I stick to games like mlponline and tf2. ^^
<cachi01|mobile> Mlponline?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I dont know how people could grow up without disney and the doctor
<Canadian_Brony> I can't even play TF2
<Emil> Not out yet, right?
<cachi01|mobile> Delos-x atleast u can play TF2
<Delos-X> Erm.. a 2d mmo, i don't want to be kicked for advertising.
<DoctoDoctorWho> No, not THAT doctor
<Vivix> the doctor isn't that big in europe, but DISNEY? Oh man..<3
<Emil> Doctor FTW.
<Delos-X> Hah, barely.
<Vivix> Doctor Seuss that is
<Emil> Oh.
<Delos-X> Unless I get permission from mods to talk aboutmlponline, I can't say anything.
<DoctoDoctorWho> eyup
<Delos-X> I don't want to get kicked or anything.
<Emil> That sucks.
<DoctoDoctorWho> mlp online?
<DoctoDoctorWho> that like an mmo or sumthin?
<Delos-X> If you really want, google it.
<Emil> Fallout Equestria, MLP online, And Legends of Equestria. All big games.
<andy> google has the answers
<Emil> Fighting is Magic.
<Chrysalis> huh
<cachi01|mobile> Dude u cn talk about MLP online
<Delos-X> I actually work as a spriter for mlponline ^^
<Chrysalis> so steam is gonna start selling software
<Vivix> Fallou Equestria should totally be a mod for fallout 2
<cachi01|mobile> Its ok
<andy> fallout equestria is a game O;o
<Canadian_Brony> to the Internet! *Batman theme*
<Chrysalis> as well as games
<MegaMoonShine> And Ponykart!
<killerpony7733> Emil: I am really looking foward to LOE
<Emil> killerpony7733: Same.
<Delos-X> I'm one of the spriters for MLPOnline.
<Canadian_Brony> I wanna play Ponykart!
<cachi01|mobile> Delos-X nice hows the game going?
<Emil> Fallout Equestria is a mod for Fallout 3.
<Vivix> Chrysalis what kind of software?
<DoctoDoctorWho> To the batPC!!
<Chrysalis> Vivix just about any from the looks of it
<Vivix> Coo-
<Delos-X> Still in development. multiplayer not out yet but singleplayer beta is.
<Vivix> I like that most of my osftware works without internet
<andy> Emil: oh
<Vivix> DAW's and Animation software should never require internet
<TOY_PON3> K I'm back lol
<Delos-X> Wb.
<MegaMoonShine> Wb TOY_PON3 :)
<Chrysalis> steam has offline mode
<Vivix> yeah, but you know-
<TOY_PON3> thanks :3
<Delos-X> I want to play deus ex again.. I forgot how fun it is to sneak around on it.
<Canadian_Brony> Emil I thought it was a fan-fiction with about 1'000 stories based off it, similar to "The Conversion Bureau"
<Vivix> for instance, a music daw computer, usually works best if it has no internet at all
<Chrysalis> most single purpose devices do
<Vivix> though- now adays even Cubase requires you to use eLicense, but eLicense can be activated offline--so nevermind it requires no net on the DAW
<DoctoDoctorWho> k I know this is a noob question but how do u ping pple? I never quite figured it out.
<Emil> Canadian_Brony: It is also a fanfic. Or, rather, a series of fanfic. But it is being made into a game.
<Canadian_Brony> ah
<Vivix> it might really cool though- I like buying software
<Canadian_Brony> ok
<Chrysalis> DoctoDoctorWho you just write there whole name
<TOY_PON3> If only I had the money to buy software :D
<Emil> Yar har...
<Vivix> Hehe
<DoctoDoctorWho> like Chrysalis?
<Chrysalis> yup
<Vivix> not all software is too expensive- but when they are, you have themf or years
<Chrysalis> that would ping me
<Chrysalis> had i not turned them off
<TOY_PON3> Vivix: I want the best of the best ^^
<Delos-X> I'm glad people are making mlp games and fan-merchandise.
<Vivix> hehe
<DoctoDoctorWho> awesomesause
<Emil> Delos-X: Same.
<Vivix> Photoshop costs 1200 usd I think? Flash much the same
<Eli> who ever invented Tab key: bless him
<Chrysalis> Delos-X like Budding Friendship
<Vivix> but! you can rent them for like.. 80 bucks a month
<TOY_PON3> Aah
<Chrysalis> that looks AWESOME XD
<Eli> i couldn't write half of your names
<DoctoDoctorWho> speaking of fan merchendise...
<TOY_PON3> If you are into an art school I'm sure you get them for free well, renting
<Canadian_Brony> DoctoDoctorWho you can write the first few letters of somepony's name and hit "tab" for a shortcut. You may have to hit "tab" more than once if the name you want doesn't appear right away
<Chrysalis> huh
<Chrysalis> i dont remember this bit
<Vivix> in school you usually get a discount, or loan the school's license
<Chrysalis> this a DLC?
<TOY_PON3> Yeah
<Delos-X> I think hasbro should make better quality plushies and things like that, the current plushies they have is bad quality, really.
<Vivix> I bought Animate 2 instad of flash, because honestly I can't afford 1200 dollars
<Emil> Delos-X: They are cheap bastards. They don't care about us. No-one does.
<Vivix> it's more geared toward traditional animation anyway-
<Eli> Delos-X: the fan made merch is way better :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> I saw a RD plushie with her at the gala dress go 4 2500 on ebay
<andy> i wanted to get into some digital art and thought of buying photoshop, just seems so expensive when i have no idea how long ill be doing it
<Emil> Delos-X: But that is the way with everything.
<cachi01|mobile> Vivix.......... Yar har.........
<TOY_PON3> Wowee
<Vivix> I stopped pirating when I started getting money
<Emil> Good boy.
<Canadian_Brony> Delos-X I've seen a hand-made Rainbow Dash plushie, but it was expensive and sold high at an auction. HOWEVER, it was super-high quality
<Emil> Or girl, I guess.
<Vivix> there are alternatives, luckily
<Vivix> boy, yeah
<Emil> Ok.
<DoctoDoctorWho> If u saw the plushie u would think it was worth it
<Vivix> and yeah, I like it- you get so much extr afrom buying too
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<Chrysalis> must put plushie on to buy list when i start getting paid
<TOY_PON3> Cool
<Eli> sometimes i think hasbro is just repainting their stock of G3 toys and then they try to sell it to us
<Vivix> like Cubase came with dvd's and cool box--and shit
<Delos-X> Yeah, I've been watching a person on DA, hoping I'll get the money to buy one of their plushies.
<Delos-X> They're amazing quallity, but start at around £80.
<Emil> Wow.
<Canadian_Brony> Chrysalis I've already added it to my list along with about 500 other things. And that's just MLP merch
<Delos-X> but they would be worth it.
<Chrysalis> Delos-X your UK based?
<Delos-X> I'm in the UK, yeah.
<Chrysalis> you going to B.U.C.K?
<BronyInstrumental> if he isn't theres still time to get tickets. 10 days left
<Canadian_Brony> ohai BronyInstrumental
<Delos-X> Wish i can, but its a 4 hour drive alone, with traffic and costs, I can't go.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hey Delos-X, I have a question?
<BronyInstrumental> cheerio Canadian_Brony
<Delos-X> Erm.. yeah?
<Delos-X> What do you want to ask?
<Eli> I wish i could go BUCk... but it's my best friends birthday, and he's turning 18 so yeah, no chance
<alexxm> Delos-X where in the UK are you
<Canadian_Brony> Delos-X I know that feel. There was a Brony meet-up in July near here, but I can't drive and my parents wouldn't let me anyway. Being 15 without a job sucks
<Delos-X> around nowrich, norfolk.
<alexxm> Delos-X croydon
<BronyInstrumental> Eli: that sucks. wish your friend a happy birthday for me :)
<TOY_PON3> I wanna go to Galacon T-T
<Delos-X> Yeah, 15 here too.
<DoctoDoctorWho> From what I heard on chat rooms and other communication media, many pple worldwide think the US is just a bunch of imperialistic pigs, what do u think of america?
<cachi01|mobile> The same
<BronyInstrumental> being 14 is worse :P
<Delos-X> I'm jealous of their gaming companies.
<Chrysalis> you must be going to very russian sites
<cachi01|mobile> Being 14 is awesome
<Delos-X> XD
<TOY_PON3> ow my eyes burn brb
<Chrysalis> Delos-X why? all the good stuff is made in canada
<andy> people generally judge americans by the reality shows
<cachi01|mobile> japan FTW
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Chrysalis> toobad there is so little good stuff from any country any more
<Delos-X> I'm going into level design, and want to go to companies like bethesda, 343 and epic games.
<Eli> BronyInstrumental: how am i gonna do that? Happy B-day Tobe. oh and happy b-day from a random internet stranger, but don't worry, he's a nice guy and he likes ponies :P
<Chrysalis> got a 1st class degree?
<Delos-X> But at the moment, I'm starting as an indie developer.
<andy> level designing would be fun
<Canadian_Brony> BronyInstrumental I was 14 two months ago. I loved being 14. I can get my driver's license next year, but I want it NOW!!!
<Delos-X> Still working on my GCSE's. XD
<Chrysalis> ahh going that route
<cachi01|mobile> BEING 14 IS AWEEESOME
<Chrysalis> Delos-X be wary
<Vivix> I stil l think it's crazy they let 16 yearolds drive
<andy> yea
<Vivix> I'm 23 and I still haven't bothered taking a license
<Delos-X> Yeah, its a competitice area.
<BronyInstrumental> Delos-X: i do my finals next year. i'm in the accelerated group so i do em a year ahead of most
<Chrysalis> i wanted to be a programmer for about 12 years
<Chrysalis> and the industry did a MASSIVE shift in the last 2/3
<Delos-X> I'm doing my finals next year too.
<Eli> Vivix: yeah... they shouldn't let 16 year olds drive
<andy> the reason for that is that 16 year olds need to be able to drive many places
<Delos-X> well, my GSCE final exams.
<Chrysalis> to the point i dont see them making games anymore
<BronyInstrumental> yeah GCSE's
<Eli> but at least, they don't let them drink :P
<andy> their citys dont allow for any other transportation
<Vivix> almost none of the 16yearolds ik new at that age had jobs, other than in summer
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix I think it's crazy people drive while using their cellphones. It's illegal here, and stupid, but they do anyway
<Chrysalis> just be aware there is a massive market crash coming
<Delos-X> IMO i want to pass the test the second time.
<Chrysalis> and the games are all crap atm
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/urWey.jpg
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Shizuka
<DoctoDoctorWho> So about my question Delos-X
<Shizuka> 13i have been here .-.
<Vivix> all the games are crap`? Indie?
<Chrysalis> Shizuka nice TP
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka that is bucking awesome.
<MegaMoonShine> Awesome, Shizuka :$
<Vivix> And yeah Canadian_Brony driving wiht cellphonesis just.. uagh
<Chrysalis> which pack is that?
<Chrysalis> or is it a shader mod?
<Vivix> and people who "I'm good to drive" are a hazard to us all
<Delos-X> What i think of america? well, Its got a lot of nice places to live, but there are some places you'd want to avoid.
<Shizuka> 13painterly pack, with shader mod
<cachi01|mobile> Canadian_Brony 2 months ago i saw a girl driving.......WHILE SOLVING A RUBICK CUBE
<Chrysalis> hang on.... different coloured lights
<Chrysalis> HAAX
<Shizuka> 13the shaders are horribly slow though, trying to find one that's just shadows to add to the set i have running now
<Delos-X> Oooh minecraft, you got the mine little pony mod?
<Vivix> I saw a girl a few weeks back who had a whole kajak in her car
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|mobile WTF?!?
<Vivix> she could see out the side window
<cachi01|mobile> IKR
<NullRadix> cachi01|mobile: not a dodecahedron? not impressed
<MegaMoonShine> U srs cachi01|mobile?! :O
<Eli> cachi01|mobile: well... ain't she talented?
<Chrysalis> shadows are expensive
<cachi01|mobile> Megamoonshine yes im serious
<Vivix> I wish miencraf wasn't java, and I wish it had shadows
<Vivix> Sunclocks would be so awesome
<cachi01|mobile> We LOLED so hard cause before we saw her we saw a dude on facebook while driving
<BronyInstrumental> sundials you mean
<Chrysalis> it has shadows
<Chrysalis> just not entity shadows
<Delos-X> There are good shaders available if your PC can run it.
<Chrysalis> or dynamic light shadows
<Canadian_Brony> that would be illegal here too. You can't drive while being distracted. Cell phones, food, GPS, your CD player, nothing.
<DoctoDoctorWho> My friend is building equestria with minecraft, Its gonna be so awesome!/)^3^(\
<Vivix> the shader adds the shadow?
<Chrysalis> but to be honest, they really ruin the look when a mod adds them
<Delos-X> hang on a sec
<Chrysalis> same as the high res texture packs
<Vivix> aah-
<cachi01|mobile> DoctoDoctorWho already made... Brohoof.com
<DoctoDoctorWho> ALL of equestria.
<Chrysalis> just ruins the look of the game
<Vivix> I play with vanilla textures at all times
<Vivix> but I want shadows for sundials-
<Ponies47> Chat derp :<
<Delos-X> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EU37kV-7e8&feature=relmfu
<cachi01|mobile> DoctoDoctorWho yep
<MegaMoonShine> No vid links Delos-X :|
<TOY_PON3> Alright I feel better
<Delos-X> Oh, ok.. sorry.
<andy> whats the deal with the no vid links rule?
*Ponies47 Wacks Delos-X over the head with a Newspaper "BAD!" :[
<Canadian_Brony> Delos-X you can link vids when there's no stream. Otherwise, only picture links during stream plz
<Delos-X> :(
<Chrysalis> eww hate motion blue in games
<TOY_PON3> it's rude
<Vivix> no vid links while people stream
<Delos-X> Ok, now I know.
<Chrysalis> same as DOF
<Obsidian> brb
<andy> makes sense i guess
<Vivix> when there's no stream we can link anything that is safe for work
<TOY_PON3> it does
<Chrysalis> both horrible things to have
<Delos-X> Well, unbelivable shaders will give you the chance to make sundials.
*Canadian_Brony grabs Ponies47 's newspaper and knocks him over the head with it. "I felt like doing that!"
<cachi01|mobile> andy someone is streaming and you nee to respect that and by giving youtube links you disrespect whats showing on the strean
<TOY_PON3> o_o
<cachi01|mobile> Its like talking when your teacher is talking
<Delos-X> I didn't know, I'm sorry.
<andy> is there a rules page somewhere?
<Canadian_Brony> s'alright
<TOY_PON3> andy yeah there is
<cachi01|mobile> andy eeyup
<DoctoDoctorWho> princess celestia vs a lord of change greater daemon, who wins?
*Ponies47 Takes out anthor Newspaper and smacks Canadian_Brony over the head with it "How did that feal?!?" :[
<Canadian_Brony> andy yes, it's called "Rules"
<cachi01|mobile> Lord of change
<Vivix> I haven't seen the rules page in a while, but for first time mods are nice and just tell you
<TOY_PON3> Yup
<Chrysalis> well they have one without DOF and MoBlur so lets have a look
*Canadian_Brony smacks Ponies47 with his newspaper. "Like that!"
<TOY_PON3> dat eye
<DoctoDoctorWho> she almost whooped its ass but then It relinquished controll of the host just enough to get her to lower her gaurd, then the LoC mind raped her.
<NullRadix> for those who *might* be here for the first time, and NOT on the bronystate website... http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
*cachi01|mobile gets two newspapers and smacks Canadian_Brony and Ponies47 STOP HITTING YOURSELFS WITH NEWSPAPERS
<TOY_PON3> dem rules
*Canadian_Brony hits cachi01|mobile with his newspaper

*Ponies47 Takes Canadian_Brony 's newspaper and cachi01|mobile 's newspapers and his newspaper and throws them into the river "Can we just have peace?"
<TOY_PON3> nope
*NullRadix dumps the river on Ponies47
*Canadian_Brony grabs an apple and holds it out to Ponies47
<Chrysalis> oh ffs, no decent download link

<Canadian_Brony> Kepp? How do I kepp?
*Delos-X takes the apple and eats it. "Thhanks!"
<TOY_PON3> An apple a day keeps the pony away
<Delos-X> Thanks*
<Serenity> I will impale your tangerine!
<Delos-X> I love apples :D
<Canadian_Brony> that was an apple
<TOY_PON3> I love sour apples

<TOY_PON3> Fisheh_Fish: That's good :3

<killerpony7733> I guess.
<Cypresswolf> Man I feel great today - had the best night's sleep In weeks, smile on my face all day & :) I didn't cuss a single time in anger - Why can't everyday be like this
<Alchemist> dunno, didnt have these kind of headphones before, I always had earphones, the ones that go behind your head and not across
*PillowPoni hugs Cypresswolf "Sweeeeet"
<andy> my ears tend to hurt if i wear headphones to long
<andy> sometimes i just pump up the volume and hang them around my neck
<alexxm> Cypresswolf good to hear
<Alchemist> but they were ruined after one year, so I decided to try these, they seemed to be more sturdy
<MegaMoonShine> That's nice Cypresswolf :)

<cow334> Sonic the hedehog
<Ponies47> Chrysalis: Sweet. I might be going to Canterlot Gardens which is in Ohio which is also in September. I hoep I can make it. I could try out Fighting is Magic and maybe meet Tara! :D

<Ponies47> *Whoops sorry Chrysalis :$
<Ponies47> I ment Cypresswolf
<killerpony7733> Wrek|Observiking: Ever noticed the trailer with this song kinda gave you the false assumption it was going to be awesome though inr eality the game didn't match it's trailer?
<Alchemist> very first game? Either donkey Kong, Fort Apocalypse or Beach Head
<HailGMAN> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybXXSHDRE4

<Cypresswolf> cow334: we're working on it :)
<HailGMAN> cool story bro.
<Cypresswolf> I'm more than happy to fund it :)
<killerpony7733> It's not a mods job to tell you to read. It's your duty to read them
<cow334> Cypresswolf: thank you and good luck at it
<Alchemist> You broke the rules!!!*smashes keyboard repeatedly*
<HailGMAN> Oh no! someone broke a rule!?
<HailGMAN> *fires Nuke*

<Meanwhile> Nuh uh Shamroc yer ma's the slag.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05sumica will soon take over however
<Slenderman> Never heard of it.
<HailGMAN> credits=longer than actual video
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: i beg to differ...yer ma's the slag..
<Jake> that was deus ex HUman Revulution : The Missing Link
<Ponies47> Wrek|Observiking: How long have you been streaming anyways?
<killerpony7733> Wrek|Observiking: Any idea what sumi will stream?
<andy> are those pictures of the game developers?
<killerpony7733> andy: Yep
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: I am inclined to disagree and point out that it is indeed your mother who is the slag.
<HailGMAN> The credits was the best part of the video. :D
<andy> kind of cool of them to do that
<andy> makes the credits more personal
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Ponies47: about... 4 horus today
<ponibas> .
<Wrek|Observiking> 0513 yesterday
<twilight_sprinkle> ,
<Wrek|Observiking> 053-4 the day before that
<Alchemist> devs tend to sneak themselves into the games quite often
<Ponies47> Wrek|Observiking: Ah. Ok. 13 yesterday O_O
<killerpony7733> andy: Indeed the team who made DXHR certainly put soul into the game.
<Cypresswolf> Ponies47: I dont know about you, but I'll aim on trying not to geek out :P I may have her autograph my Manic Twilight custom :)
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: welp i guess my ma's the slag...i cant make a good enough comeback to counter that..
<HailGMAN> is there anyway to skip credits. i mean, does anyone actuallly want to watch credits?:P
<twilight_sprinkle> HailGMAN: its that or buffer screen
<Wrek|Observiking> 05consider the credits the intermission before next streamer takes over
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Alright then.
<andy> who is the next streamer?
<Alchemist> Sumi
<Wrek|Observiking> 05sumica
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf: Epic. I just might get a picture of me brohoofing her or somthing like that. I have really nothing she could autograph :$
*ponibas sigh
<Cypresswolf> Ponies47: ^_^ OH, and have her do her crazy laugh while she signs it :D
<Ponies47> ponibas: What's wrong? :<

<Meanwhile> There are two movies tonight.

<Shizuka> 13Pikachu: did you seriously not just read that...
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Pikachu> :3 maybeh
<Meanwhile> The third Pirates of the Caribbean and the third Indiana Jones.
<Ponies47> Pikachu: What Shizuka said
<MadSurge> :O movie time this early? Sweet!
<pony_9938> | (• ◡•)|
<Alchemist> pirates of the caribbean 3...meh. First one was awsm, the others fell flat imo.
*Schroedingers-Lil_B is kinda here
<Ponies47> I never realyl got into Pirates of The Caribbean. Indiana Jones. BUCK YEAH!
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: i think this is ordinary stream for now
<Meanwhile> Movies aren't actually on for like, 2 hours.
<Ponies47> *really
<Cypresswolf> I need to dust my custom collection again :| the clay ones are the hardest to clean - they're just a pet hair magent
<Pikachu> i luv moives eccpet long ones moives
<MadSurge> Alchemist: only saw the first of those
<MadSurge> :O Sumica time!
<Meanwhile> Oh hey, this thing.
<Alchemist> Schroedingers-Lil_B: I saw you, now what? ;)
<shana> yay it's Toaru Majutsu no Index :D
<MadSurge> I spy Sumipony :D
<Cypresswolf> I'm afraid to use water on most of them, I don't want to wipe the pain off :(
<Pikachu> i thought this wat black butler XD
<Cypresswolf> *paint
<Pikachu> *was
<Schroedingers-Lil_B> Alchemist well, yeah, NOW you see me...
<Sumica> 00,10Seeing as I got accused of only showing this up till the clifhanger last time =p
<twilight_sprinkle> dont all the eps end on a cliffhanger?
<Ponies47> I'm not saying I hate it but I'm not a big fan of anime. But if Sumi stream I don't mind.
<Alchemist> that reminds me, I want to give Hellsing another chance
<andy> can someone give me a plot breakdown here?
<Alchemist> someone said I watched the wrong one and that one sucked, but I dunno what version shall I watch
<Wrek|Observiking> 05would wearing a suit to BUCK be too much?
<Sumica> 00,10too much words for ponies
<Cypresswolf> I'm glad Hasbro is coming out with officail toys for many of the background character, but it sure does put a damper on custom collecting for me - official blind bag versions are much cheaper and easier to collect - I dont have to worry about cleaning a real blind bag in water
<Schroedingers-Lil_B> Alchemist the last Part of Hellsing Ultimate will be released this August in Japan, Subs should follow soon :) I'm so exited :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02My Minecraft server has been updated to support 1.3.1 :3
<Ponies47> Wrek|Observiking: Not really sure. It would make you look nice :P
<MASF123> I just got a Copyright from Hasbro
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek|Observiking: a tad much , but just ask Saturn , i'm sure he'd help
<killerpony7733> SuperBrony64: Yay then i can finally join again!
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: Yay :3
<Shizuka> 13joke ist on you

<MrPipin> wow, what is this ?
<Vivix> MacRonald?
<Serenity> 'dat limewire
<twilight_sprinkle> and then firefox randomly crashed
<Chicken_Striker> I use google chrome
<twilight_sprinkle> i use chrome sually too
<Serenity> Recently, Firefox has been memoryleaking a lot
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/t55D4.gif
<Vivix> My firefox memory leaked everywhere, changed to chrome
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: That dude's sinuses are toast...
<Chicken_Striker> wait, I`m a chicken
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the proper way to eat fast noodles
<Serenity> El shitbox was driven to 512mb used by the program
<RDashie> ARE WE WATCHING PORN AGAIN?
<Serenity> Overdoing the ram and almost frying it
<shana> RDashie: No.
<RDashie> :C
<Wrek|Observiking> 05that would imply we watched porn before
<Serenity> Well actually, it fried one of them
<Serenity> That's why El shitbox only has 512 ram now :3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i have too noticed firefox memoryleakign alot latley
<Wrek|Observiking> 05good thing i have 16 gigs of it
<Vivix> I think chrome is running around 600mb ram to me now- it's got too many exe's and I'm too lazy to add it up
<RDashie> so anime goes on in the stream , and stuff about PCs in the chat
<RDashie> nice
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so it only gets noticable sometimes
<Vivix> 16gb <3
<Serenity> Wrek|Observiking: You're just saying that to make El shitbox jelly! My 512 mb could kick yo ass D:<
<Eli> If someone gets threatened by a girl "I will get you into bed and if it's the last thing I do." is that a good or a bad thing?
<RDashie> i have 4 and only 3.5 usable
<Wrek|Observiking> 05that a challenge?
<Serenity> Eli: Depends
<Vivix> Depends whether or not you want it
<Anime_Striker> I now have a random sword
<Vivix> Women have been arrested for rape too
*Serenity throws moniter
<twilight_sprinkle> the pedopolice
<Anime_Striker> I`m using pc

<Serenity> I must officially say, when I get my new computer that replaces El shitbox, I'm gonna record a video of me shooting it
<Meanwhile> Kitty.
<Serenity> Must also try and get a crowbar too from somewhere :S
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i need to know her better before i give any advice
<Wrek|Observiking> 05if she's even a bit homocidal

<RDashie> OH GOD IM SORRY, what was that?
<Vivix> RDashie was wondering if Alexxm was gone, or something
<Wrek|Observiking> 05why would they be dead in the first place?
<Tyler_The_Creator> thats a thin Ciggerette
<RDashie> because he always asks everyone the same question

<Vivix> she sounds like a kid, but looks like an adult
<twilight_sprinkle> theres a woman who likes 9 and is over 20 in this anime, so its impossible to know
<Vivix> "Hey, is this the police? There's some guy gluing cards to my house"
<Vivix> hn-
<RDashie> i cant help but remember Jhonny Bravo saying " oh cancel that, its just me"
<Vivix> hehe
<twilight_sprinkle> poitnless twist is pointless
<Serenity> RDashie: Yeah

<RDashie> hey mods or w/e, am i allowed to post yt links here?
<Vivix> not during stream
<Wrek|Observiking> 05not during streams
*Bunny_Striker hops towards Serenity
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you should know this
<Wrek|Observiking> 05read the rules
<Serenity> See if it gains at least 0.1 megahert from it
<RDashie> herp, no one does that
*Serenity stabs Bunny_Striker
<Vivix> I did..
<Serenity> RDashie: We all do.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05actualyl yes
<Wrek|Observiking> 05everyoen here but you has
<Vivix> I am pretty lame, though
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt :$
<RDashie> good, should i feel bad?
<Meanwhile> Not reading the rules results in being told to read the rules.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05then go read the rules
<Vivix> The rules are mostly common "open age chat" rules though
<RDashie> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> NEVER
<Meanwhile> Not reading the rules at all eventually results in infractions and a hammer to the face.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05hehe
<pony_7007> banhammer to be exact
<RDashie> god, dont you just love mods?
<CyborgBunny_Striker> See wat you did Serenity, I`m a Cyborg bunny now
<Wrek|Observiking> 05no but in all seriousness, go read them before you give me an excuse to ban you.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Hammer? Thought it was cinderblocks with you?
<RDashie> i know i do
<Vivix> The rules are, broken down, basically don't be a jerk, don't spoil, kidfriendly-ish
<Wrek|Observiking> 05it has happened before it will happen again
<twilight_sprinkle> ok. will rules of etiquette in engineering suffice?
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: and entertainment for us :S
<Meanwhile> Serenity: Me? I'm not a mod. I'm regular chat sludge.
<Serenity> So am I
*Eulshy Yawns
<twilight_sprinkle> i know the rules anyway
<Cypresswolf> Wrek's Hammer > Thor's Hammer
<twilight_sprinkle> its more fun figuring them out on the go
<RDashie> this is boring, pls someone say something about xbox or ps3
<Meanwhile> Xbox and PS3 are shite.
<Serenity> ^
<RDashie> XD
<RDashie> i agree
<Wrek|Observiking> 05eew consoles
<Serenity> So my PC, hence the name
<CyborgBunny_Striker> COMPUTERS FOR THE WIN!!
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: you're not sludge, you're the resident grammar nazi. :)
<Vivix> Consoles are for the family room
<Eulshy> Cypresswolf, you will now go create a Hammer in Skyrim and call it Wrek's Hammer
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Spectrum_Rush: you mean spelling nazi
<Vivix> indeed
<Cypresswolf> YES!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and yes PC MASTER RACE!
*CyborgBunny_Striker nibbles on a carrot
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek|Observiking: right you are
<Serenity> Wrek|Observiking: Technically speaking, nowadays, Spelling falls into grammar
<Wrek|Observiking> 05harr harr
<Chrysalis> Consoles and handhelds tremble before the might of the PC
<RDashie> any PC expert around here?
<Vivix> no, Serenity, grammar is clauses and punctuation. Not just spelling
<Cypresswolf> There can only be ONE Wrek's Hammer - and he isn't going to give it up anytime soon!
<Chrysalis> RDashie define expert
<Vivix> most "grammar nazis" don't do well in grammar, only spelling
<Serenity> I know that, but spelling nowadays is accepted as grammar as well
<RDashie> :|
<Wrek|Observiking> 05I use an axe
<Serenity> I use a rocket launcher
<Cypresswolf> Then the Hammer is MINE!
<twilight_sprinkle> PUT DAT PUDDING DOWN, NAO
<Chrysalis> inb4 someone makes a mod for a game which adds Wreks Hammer / Axe as a weapon
<Eulshy> Dat lie
<Serenity> Well, well..
<Vivix> When you enchant weapons, can you give them names?
<RDashie> hey , guys are you getting cs go?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05though if i was usign a hamemr it would look sometihng like...
<twilight_sprinkle> im fine with cs:source
<Meanwhile> Axe of Unforgiving Bumtase.
<Chrysalis> i'm not
<Shamroc> RDashie: my freind already bought it haha
*CyborgBunny_Striker poops inside one of RDashie`s shoe
<Serenity> Done. I have officially added Wrek's Hammer into my RPG
<RDashie> O.o
<Cypresswolf> Personally, I use a mace - The spinier, the better :)
<Eulshy> Serenity, and thus your RPG was inbalanced by it's power
<Vivix> Easter egg! It's okay to be OP if you get it from an easter egg
<Dark_Horst> looks like i shoudl pick up enchanting. i've been using the same skyforge sword for 20 levels. it needs a name
<Serenity> Kinda, you hit like a bloody lorry then a bulldozer, but you don't gain any hp from it
<RDashie> le
<Cypresswolf> I loved the look of the Master Mace in Fable 2 :)
*CyborgBunny_Striker is MLG
<Wrek|Observiking> 05heres a render of my banhammer had it been a hamemr and not an axe
<Wrek|Observiking> 05http://i.imgur.com/EogDB.jpg
<pony_7007> nice
<Dark_Horst> hammery
<Serenity> Wrek|Observiking: Okay then, I'll try and make a low poly version and import it :3
<Vivix> Looks like it hurts
<RDashie> gabens is better
<CyborgBunny_Striker> IT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER!!
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: are you talking skyrim mods?
<RDashie> like anime bigger, like a 2 tons sword
<Serenity> No. Hell noe
<Dark_Horst> bummer
<Wrek|Observiking> 05that model is actually 2 million polys
<Serenity> I don't do Skinram
<Dark_Horst> what then?
<Eli> if i ever write a fanfic, i'm gonna add wrek's hammer. awesome weapon
<Serenity> Yeah, SLIGHTLY over what D3D can manage
<Wrek|Observiking> 05thoguh at the time i sucked at making hard carved surfaves look good
<Chrysalis> only on steam
<CyborgBunny_Striker> O3O
<Chrysalis> is the game cheaper than the DLC
<Serenity> I was looking at around 50-120 polies :3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but i got the texture right
<FlaschenJoe11> HI everypony
<Serenity> Oh well, I can fi it
<Vivix> those 2 million polygons are why games use bumpmapping
<Chrysalis> game £3.74, DLC £7.99
<Vivix> imagine how many poly's they shave off-
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its as big as a 2 hander but wierlds like a 1 hander
<Wrek|Observiking> 05goes well wit ha shield
<CyborgBunny_Striker> NAVIS!! NAVIS EVERYWHERE
<Serenity> So a 1 hand weapon
<Serenity> Okay
*FlaschenJoe11 does joydance since he got his final confirmation mail from Galacon.
<Serenity> Will have the cut the damage down a tad
<Wrek|Observiking> 05thats the point of it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its a huge 2 hadned hammer
<RDashie> DED
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but I wield it as a 1 hadned
<killerpony7733> Wrek|Observiking: I wonder is it a weapon for skyrim?. Looks like it but i may be wrong
<CyborgBunny_Striker> NOT THE ANIME GIRLS!!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05feel free to keep it 2 handed
<alexxm> well shes ded
<RDashie> not
<Wrek|Observiking> 05as logn as i get a 1 hadned version if i play your game
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: which game?
<RDashie> a
<RDashie> BIG SURPRISE
<Serenity> Well, it's 1.2 seconds per attack, doing around 2186 - 6954 Damage. That's around 5-8% of hp damage
<FlaschenJoe11> hi fellow regulars
<Vivix> what?
<Vivix> How much HP do you use?
<Eulshy> Sweet hamma
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
<CyborgBunny_Striker> El shitbox
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i recall a wc3 mod that used a ban hammer as a weapon
<Serenity> Well I'm a tank spec, so I can take a shit ton
<Serenity> I have 77k
<Wrek|Observiking> 05on hit it banished the target for 5 seconds
<Vivix> Ahha-
<Vivix> I'm a fan of using 100 hp as absolute maximum
<alexxm> so many ded people
<ponibas> "The Ban Hammer is a weapon skin for TERA
<Vivix> and DT and AC and whatever as moidfiers to make leveling interesting
<Chrysalis> hmmm, Wrek's Hammer Vs Hammer of Notch
<Vivix> but I also like to have weapons unlevelable
<Serenity> The hp of your avarage guy is around 40-50k
<RDashie> HEARD THAT
<Vivix> in what game?
<FlaschenJoe11> Chrysalis: That's the end of the universe
<Chrysalis> FlaschenJoe11 ikr, that much power
<Eulshy> I'ma go play a game so bye ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> doesnt take a doctor to know you shouldnt rip arteries
<CyborgBunny_Striker> breast?

<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: eh :P
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Serenity is basically a big word for peace
<Chrysalis> i know
<Vivix> Kkkkinda
<Serenity> I haven't actually seen the film, but I presume it has something to do with restoring peace to earth? :S
*CyborgBunny_Striker nibbles on Serenity`s shoes
<Chrysalis> but i associate it with the film
<Vivix> It means to be at peace, not "war" kind of peace
<Eli> that actually makes me wonder why we don't have anyone named Harmony...
<Serenity> Eli: Because Nittany_Discord happened
*CyborgBunny_Striker nibbles on Serenity`s shoes
*Serenity punts CyborgBunny_Striker
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because what?

<Sumica> 00,10Seems like all you have done from the moment you got her RDashie is complain so clearly you need to have it pointed out for you or you are some strange version of a Masocist
<Vivix> Some people have been pretty jerky about not liking what is on the stream, I'm guessing streamers are a bit itchy about it
<Buytoast> oh, space yugioh

<Nrutas> Barbetos: oh, is that the one with the dragons and the pushing and the chickens?
<Serenity> Vivix: If you want a decent game like that, just get Counter strike
<Thrackerzod> i dont mind if you play cod as long as you didnt pay for it
<WG> Kingman725 : problem is treyarch always makes high requirement engines, so I couldn't even run it on 640x480..damn :\
<Serenity> More specifically, get CS2
<RDashie> why would u play it in that res?
<RDashie> jeez
<WG> Thrackerzod : Never paying for a thing :D
<otakon> um she's not HUMAN though
<Reikim> And suddenly medical equipment.
<RawketLawnchair> Oh boy, I love house!
<Vivix> Depends on taste Thrackerzod , I've tried MW3 and BF3, enjoyed both- don't enjoy CS, but play none for more than..well I don't play them anymore
<Zawanz77> spoilers
<Barbetos> Nrutas No. Thats Fable. Haha. just kidding. Your right, yes.
<Reikim> otakon: What are we watching?
<otakon> welp this won't end well
<Serenity> RDashie: So it runs, plus lots of people can take that res
<otakon> Reikim: it's SG1
<Lil_B|Happy> all the real doctors
<WG> Serenity : Life is boring as hell and I've got nothing else to do except working all summer. If I could I'd go anywhere on holidays or gokarting...
<RDashie> omg look at that 2 pound force that doc is applying
<Kingman725> WG: well i think its time for a computer upgrade...
<Reikim> Sweet, TV show I never got around to watching.
<Thrackerzod> WG i do pay for games
<Serenity> I play Diablo 2 in 640x480 cuz it can't run it in 800x600
<RawketLawnchair> What pone is that in the bottom left?
<Nrutas> RawketLawnchair: ipone
<otakon> she's pregnant
<Reikim> RawketLawnchair: Sumica.
<otakon> the buck?
<FlaschenJoe11> O'Neil vs Mitchell?
<RDashie> ROBOT?
<Serenity> WG: Could waste your life playing Counter strike which is basically a good version of CoD, you'd be a lot happier
<Nrutas> pregnant fluttershy is best fluttershy
<otakon> RawketLawnchair: DUDE! Long time no see
<Thrackerzod> SHE IS A ROBIT
<otakon> the hell is that?
<Nrutas> but pregnant dash is also adorable
<RawketLawnchair> It's cursed.
<Reikim> Well that don't look too good.
<Meanwhile> That doesn't sound right.
<Thrackerzod> ZUUL
<Bronysith> and i am back
<Vivix> what is best between CS and CoD is up to the player, not us
<Spectrum_Rush> that looks painful
<Spectrum_Rush> ...

<Kingman725> the beeping getting faster......shes gonna explode!
<WG> Serenity : I don't know, counter strike is not my thing becuase you can't aim down the sight and stuff. Killstreaks don't matter for me but I also hate how Infinity Ward has nothing new to offer
<Serenity> Looks like a tumour
<RDashie> look like house
<Barbetos> RawketLawnchair Heeeey. Where you get that name? I was saying that like crazy on my communities stream like a month ago.

<Barbetos> Now I want to play Metal Slug
<Reikim> How many times are they going to shock this girl? I mean damn.
<RDashie> DAYUM
<WG> Kingman725 : Do you think that CPU matters that much to upgrade from dual core 2.6GHZ to Quad cores, or should I just keep to GPU?
<Daygon> WHAT IS WRONGWITH YOU
<Lil_B|Happy> Reikim whats better, death or beeing shocked a million times?
<Vivix> CPU Ghz matters MORE than core count
<Serenity> GPU, always
<Sumica> 00,10oh it's RawketLawnchair, have not seen that name in some time
<RDashie> mom? your mom is dead
<alexxm> her mom is dead
<Serenity> My mum isn't dead...
<Reikim> Lil_B|Happy: I mean, the writers seem to jump straight to the defibs whenever they need a medical emergency.
<Kingman725> WG: well im not too much of a computer person, but i think it would help
<RawketLawnchair> Howdy ho, Sumica
<WG> Serenity: Honestly, I tried getting it to work through steam, but I got protocol version errors and stuff

<Ponies47> GTG later everypony :)
<Daygon> Bye Ponies47
<Serenity> Goodbye, Ponies47 and the other 46 ponies
<FlaschenJoe11> I liked O'Neil. He was funny. And Seeyah Ponies47
<Reikim> ...Well, those plushies aren't too bad.
<RDashie> that guy has gay eyes
<Daygon> what is this show?
<Serenity> I'll bound to your superior knowledge of gay eyes, RDashie

<Guybrush_Threepwood> CaptainGanjalf I always call him british gestapo guy, because thats pretty much what he is :/
<Kandarihu> alexxm, wasn't Barbossa the man who is so evil that Hell itself spit him back out?
<Darf14> He needs a hug
<CaptainGanjalf> Eels bad, man:(
<String_Shredder> I wish I had a beard that played organ
*Admiral_Otakon takes the stump and attaches a mighty hook.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: but it's okay, because the military are like...assholes! that makes it okay for the pirates to pillage and destory people's lives!
<Captain_Michael> sad jones :(
<CriticKitten> FirstMateMaidkim: And yet I found Death Note easier to follow than this movie.
<Bronysith> DAVY JONES <3
<ThePoniFromTortuga> The right for Meanwhile to do any bodily harm to anyone, suuuuuuuuuuuspendeed
<RaveBrony> :(
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: I believe that's blackbeard
<ThePoniFromTortuga> dat lone tear
<CriticKitten> Wait.
<Sumica> 00,10his skin is much more wrinkled this time
<alexxm> Kandarihu good point
<RaveBrony> The 1 manly tear
<Captain_Michael> mainly tears
<FirstMateMaidkim> RAWRity: You, sir, are quite impressive.
<Crimson_Phoenix> Death Note is easy
*Meanwhile chops ThePoniFromTortuga in half.
<CriticKitten> He removed his heart to prevent himself from having feelings. HAX!
<Admiral_Otakon> just salt water
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He's mad! Jim!
<CaptainGanjalf> Must.. not.. cry..
<Captain_Striker> BUFFER
<alexxm> aw cthullu feels sad
<Coxswain_Nrutas> heh
<Coxswain_Nrutas> cocks
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, so the military being evil makes the civilians expendable?
<CabinBoy_Sid> Hey it those guys
<Admiral_Otakon> and then he had feelings
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: Nah, it just makes him immortal. Still hax, though.
<CaptainGanjalf> Turn sad... into... rrRAGE
<Admiral_Otakon> THOSE TWO!
<Guybrush_Threepwood> why aren't they red anymore?
*ThePoniFromTortuga just stares *lol really, Meanwhile?*
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> shouldn't he cry ink like Squidgirl?
<Captain_Michael> cool crew jones
<Crimson_Phoenix> Some dweeb thought he could control the world with a book and an anti-social thought he could stop him
<Meanwhile> ThePoniFromTortuga: Turns out, yeah.
<Sumica> 00,10I will naugt
<Crimson_Phoenix> there
<Crimson_Phoenix> Death Note
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: I was being facetious. But yes, that's the logic the movie follows.

<RaveBrony> WHat!?!?
<CriticKitten> YOU KILLED THE KRAKEN?
<CriticKitten> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!?
<Meanwhile> FirstMateMaidkim: Since they got Jone's heart.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> He killed le Kraken? That's best pet
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> Where my badass Kraken death scene?
<alexxm> the krakens killed
<LordMoistBeckett> The Kraken was suspended
<Navigator_magmablock> Beckatt is such an asshole
<Captain_Michael> not the kraken!!!
<Admiral_Otakon> wait when and HOW did they kill the Kraken?
<StinkomanFan> LIVING IN A MATERIAL WORLD
<StinkomanFan> I AM THE MATERIAL GIRL
<Captain_Michael> why surumeeeeee
*Meanwhile hugs ThePoniFromTortuga.
<Eulshy> Well duh, if it was then it would be now
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Watch out! It's beating!
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: because he wanted to...um....I a....BECAUSE HE'S A DICK. AND THAT'S UST WHAT HE DOES.
<Darf14> That chest has a Heart Container
<Admiral_Otakon> suddenly stars
<Pirate_Spectrum_Rush> ooo pretty
<Kandarihu> Release the Kraken... set it free!
<LordMoistBeckett> Navigator_magmablock, you startin with me?
<CaptainGanjalf> FirstMateMaidkim: Yep, since Norrington have brought them Jones' heart
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Admiral_Otakon: I guess they made him blast the thing to hell
<Godking_Buytoast> that's one placid ass sea
<Admiral_Otakon> hmmm
<Godking_Buytoast> i mean goddaamn
<Sumica> 00,10a sea of stars

<ThePoniFromTortuga> Admiral_Otakon: To show whose boss
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Suddenly, FLUTTESHY :O
<killerpony7733> Dat fluttershy
<Serenity> 'dat Flutters
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: Might have been because it's an unholy terror of the seas and a threat to everyone.
<Admiral_Otakon> it's peaceful
<Darf14> Flutterbunny :)
<Captain_Michael> dat fluttershy
<RaveBrony> Oh no!
<Admiral_Otakon> flutterbunny?
<Navigator_Vordox> Hai Twi Magic
*Captain_Striker Chugs down a bottle of rum

<RustyMeat> derp
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Sudenly, background... :P
<Navigator_Vordox> Also
<Captain_Striker> WAT
<RaveBrony> :D
<Navigator_Vordox> Tia and Luna <3
<Admiral_Otakon> Sumica: ping lag test ping
<CriticKitten> That is batshit stupid! Beckett could use the Kraken to destroy ANY SHIP HE WANTS AT ANY TIME. Why would you kill a weapon like that? That's like having access to Bahamut, and instead of using it, you tell it to MegaFlare itself to death.
<Captain_Striker> never mind
<Captain_Michael> woona
<RAWRity> FirstMateMaidkim: one thing about that: he could have used the Kraken to destroy tons of pirate ships and territories with it.
<Pirate_Spectrum_Rush> Navigator_Vordox: Woona
<Sumica> 00,10you got a long wait Otakon
<Wrek|Suspended> 05CriticKitten; casue it could be used agaisnt him
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: ...Point taken. Well then, Beckett's just an asshole.
<Admiral_Otakon> Sumica: you turned it off didn't you?
<Wrek|Suspended> 05there was a middle hand of control
<Sumica> 00,10no, wrek is streaming
<StinkomanFan> CriticKitten, think of it like having a nuke. It's too dangerous for anypony else to ever get
<Admiral_Otakon> oh
<RaveBrony> :D
<Meanwhile> Nice logic.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Wait a sec... John Williams composes this, right? :O
<Admiral_Otakon> Wrek|Suspended: post anything when you hear this ping.
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: And then Wrek provides the counterpoint I was only just realizing.
<Captain_Michael> pirate logic
<Darf14> good logic
<ThePoniFromTortuga> PinkiePieYoshi64: Hans Zimmer
<CriticKitten> Wrek: How? He has the heart. He'd never be able to use it against Beckett without risking the heart and his own life.
<Meanwhile> If you can't find it, you need to be lost to get there! Makes total sense
<killerpony7733> Inb4 they read the end of the world
<FirstMateMaidkim> PinkiePieYoshi64: Nope, Hans Zimmer.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> OMG best scene is next
<RAWRity> Wrek|Suspended: save for the fact that, were Jones to betray him, He'd have the heart right there to stab. That's how he got jones to follow him.
<killerpony7733> reach*
<Eulshy> I'm hungry
<Wrek|Suspended> 05its still a risk
<Wrek|Suspended> 05a 3rd hand
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Nevermind, sounds identical :P
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Meanwhile: To someone like Barbossa, yeah.
<FirstMateMaidkim> PinkiePieYoshi64: Just as good.
<Captain_Michael> then the end of the world
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: doesnt bahamut gets healed byflare?. Its because the kraken is still the biggest threat of the navy. And its a good test to test the loyalty
<Darf14> wow..... the world is flat
<Navigator_Vordox> Yay! Water Park Run!
<Guybrush_Threepwood> the Chrich was right! the earth IS Flat!
<Wrek|Suspended> 05he oculd order to decimate the ship before beckett would even be able to open the chest
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01Who flattened the earth?
<Wrek|Suspended> 05it would end on the bottom of the sea
<Captain_Striker> edge of the world
<Captain_Michael> it's the end of the world as we know it!
*Admiral_Otakon raises his hand

<Eulshy> Suddenly, I'm hungry
<CriticKitten> Wrek: In which case the heart is crushed by the ocean's pressure and Davy dies.
<Kandarihu> Pirates of the Waterfall
<PinkiePieYoshi64> So if they fall over... will they fall forever into space...?
<StinkomanFan> Save us Zecora!

<RAWRity> aaaaaand welcome to filler everybody!
<Captain_Michael> ma peanut
<Darf14> so is that murdur or suicide?
<FirstMateMaidkim> Wrek|Suspended: For that matter, why would Jones follow Beckett in the first place? Jones is immortal so long as the heart remains, and Beckett doesn't dare stab the heart because it's such a major asset he'd be losing. So why, then, does Jones eve bother?
<Admiral_Otakon> WAIT WHAT?!
<ThePoniFromTortuga> I love this I LOVE IT
<CriticKitten> Wrek: But he seems just fine being a lapdog for the course of this film....I dunno, I maintain that it's incredibly stupid of him to throw away what amounts to a reuseable tactical nuke. :/

<Admiral_Otakon> RAWRity: in a sense but not really
<Pirate_Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: if he wasnt already
<CabinBoy_Sid> Meanwhile: When was he ever sane?

<Kandarihu|MaidsMop> So these two guys are the only ones who are truely right-side up
<Pirate_Spectrum_Rush> Barbossa's got kinda of a bum leg
<AdmiralYahooz> its all about weight placement

<ThePoniFromTortuga> Meanwhile, ALL the backstabbing!
<Meanwhile> It was not a question.
<ChartmanFan> THIS WAS THE PLAN ALL ALONG! TO TURN THE BRITS AND THE CHINESE AGAINST EACHOTHER!
<CaptainGanjalf> not done!
<Navigator_Vordox> I LOVE all these plottwists WITHIN 3 SCENES at same FRIGGING TIME
<gunter_the_penguin> oh snap
<Lil_B> Helmsmaid_Tovler I think that were all the Quotes :/ (I just renamed myself)

<Helmsmaid_Tovler> We have an accord and a lexus
<CaptainGanjalf> another innuendo?
<Darf14> tiny gun
<FirstMateMaidkim> CriticKitten: Actually they mentioned her when what's-her-name was infodumping on Davey Jones...but still within the same movie, so the point mostly stands.
<gunter_the_penguin> boom
<CaptainGanjalf> mmmcap'n Jack Sparrow

<Shooeie> Backstab

<Captain_Striker> FUCK YOU BRITS!!!!
<gunter_the_penguin> eeeyup
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I thought they had no ammo... :O
<CriticKitten> FirstMateMaidkim: Aye. It's basically "writers realized the scenario was unwinnable unless they had a god....so they gave the pirates a god".
<Captain_Michael> lol
<Meanwhile> Captain_Striker: Yeah well fuck you too.
<AdmiralYahooz> OH HAPPY FEET
<PIRatey> Like I said earlier, this script needed to go to an editor and be rewritten to cut the fat.

<RaveSwabbie> Badass :D
<Captain_Michael> escape like a boss
<Narolas> Calipso was mentionned inderectly in the second movie, with the story of davy jones and the woman/sea he loved (the goddess, calypso), a lot of references to their love already in the second movie, just subtle
<Lt_Major> XD
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> This movie needs more Goofy hollers

<sonicandmario85> lunas been sleeping there all day...
<AdmiralYahooz> CriticKitten: he probably does. but keep in mind that it can withstand a barracade for years
<Lil_B> Japan had no Fleet between 16th centoury up to the 19th century... nobody was allowed to enter or Leave Japan during that time, so no Ninja's here :P
<Helmsmaid_Tovler> fu manchu
<PIRatey> CriticKitten: because he um...he hasn't visited in a while?
<Narolas> Davy isn't happy at all with what beckett is doing, critickitten, he's probably lying
<ChartmanFan> CriticKitten, it's only for the PIRATE COUNSIL
<RaveSwabbie> O_o

<Coxswain_Nrutas> everyone wants to fuck her
<CrazyHippie1234> yes
<gunter_the_penguin> eeyup
<Meanwhile> AdmiralSaxy: Because the company has his heart.
<FirstMate_JESmith67> Anne Bonnie comes to mind
<twilight_sprinkle> gotta say, dat trade company is epic for controlling Davy Jones like that
<Sabershy> Nah... I missed a lot of the movie.
<RaveSwabbie> AdmiralSaxy: Tables have turned
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> AdmiralSaxy: because they have his heat
<CommodoreJoe11> AdmiralSaxy: They still have his heart.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, Norrington, how dare you choose the side of law and order! You should be stealing from people for a living like me!
<Narolas> He's being forced to, they can kill him with the heart

<Navigator_Vordox> Senility
<CriticKitten> AdmiralYahooz: I've seen the film before. It's really not as fortified as he claims and the pirates would be grossly outnumbered in any case. They could outlast the pirates or conquer them, whichever they prefer. :P
<CabinBoy_Sid> he's too far gone
<Meanwhile> Amnesia much.
<Darf14> poor him

<ThePoniFromTortuga> Admiral_Otakon: /) for noticing
<Navigator_Vordox> NORRINGTOOOON! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Meanwhile> Well that was easy.
<PIRatey> This movie isn't unsalvageable. If they'd just sent it to a good editor to cut the Calpso subplot, make the characters' motivations more easy to follow, and get rid of the uneeded comic relief, this could have been a really good conclusion to the trilogy. Instead it's a muddied mess of plans and subplots and backstabbing and unlikable characters.

<Admiral_Otakon> suddenly Larry
<AdmiralYahooz> CriticKitten: or, maybe he knows, but doesnt know that the pirate lords plan to meet, and doesnt see a reason to go there. but then that means he would be in total miscommunication with Beckett :p

<ThePoniFromTortuga> Bronystate in a nutshell
<Captain_Michael> politics...
<Wrek|Suspended> 05so that is what is goign on in parlament!
<Darf14> average day at 4chan
<Navigator_magmablock> Spartajoke.jpg
<AdmiralYahooz> THIS IS POLITICS
<Franek12354> This is our government at modern
<CaptainGanjalf> dat quote
<Lil_B> to bad all german Pirates are occopied with the Hanse :/
<Cypresswolf> politics is the same in every way of life
<Captain_Michael> new meme
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Meanwhile, in Bronystate
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well if the navy is forced to send in by small portions then maybe they can
<RaveSwabbie> ^
<Meanwhile> Yo.
<Pirate_Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile on the Black Pearl
<CrazyHippie1234> creeepppyyyy
<Coxswain_Nrutas> we need Pony Time
*Meanwhile in the brig...

<Navigator_Vordox> I want a music box like that...
<Navigator_Vordox> :'(
<Coxswain_Nrutas> pirates need ponies
<PIRatey> CriticKitten: and even if they could...The navy could afford to play the waiting game at this point. Plus, they have Jones and the Dutchman.
<Lt_Major> Wrek|Suspended: na theyre just sitting there drinking tea while going "HMPH!!!!" To each other :P
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> Lil_B: did we even have famous pirates?
<Navigator_Vordox> With Nier Song...
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The British navy had enough ships to blockade the entire coastline of the Americas at this point in time and still fight a war with France at the same time. This little pirate fort would not outlast that navy. >_>
<RaveSwabbie> Meanwhile: Dat use of your name :D
<ThePoniFromTortuga> I want that locket
<Darf14> I seen enough hentai to know where this is going
<ponyfromPR> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: you cant know what resources they have
<RaveSwabbie> O_O
<Captain_Michael> lmao Darf14
<PIRatey> twilight_sprinkle: but you can knw that they have Jones, and Jones don't fuck around.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: maybe its a huge udnerground base
<Ninja-Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: i doubt they are in charge of the entire navy.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Their supplies are irrelevant. The British navy is the largest navy in the entire world at this point in time, there is no way in hell that the pirates could outsupply them. >_>
<Lil_B> Ninja-Fou_Lou Störtebecker kinda, but Karibean Pirates are more famous
<PIRatey> twilight_sprinkle: regardless, the navy could afford to play the waiting game until the Pirates starved
<CaptainGanjalf> CriticKitten: I don't think EIC control ALL the british navy
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Admiral_Otakon> so, anyone else getting lag?

<Captain_Michael> transformation!
<Bronysith> Admiral_Otakon: is there any real hatred for this movie?
<alexxm> since when did she have the power to do that
<CriticKitten> CaptainGanjalf: Actually? According to the world they're establishing in this movie, they pretty much own all shipping and supplies, so they have as many navy ships as they ask for.
<Captain_Maid_Discord> 11,01She found the "Tentacle disengage" button.
<ThePoniFromTortuga> Woo, nice looking mad if you get rid of the outrageous beard
<PIRatey> twilight_sprinkle: so that means the Pirates would be well and trully fucked.
