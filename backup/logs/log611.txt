<otakon> I SEE TETSUJIN 28!
<LoGaN> hi
<otakon> wait...haven't you done this one already Caramel?
<Reikim> What was with that little colours shenanigan there, Meanwhile?
<otakon> hiya LoGaN
<Meanwhile> Making a point.
<otakon> LoGaN: I see your 24 hour ban is up, that's good.
<kirz|art> *cough*exploit*cough*
<Caramel> otakon: nope
<fluttershyFTW> ....
<otakon> crap
<Meanwhile> And yeah that particular method is an exploit but the point was that people don't read.
<FillyFlam> Hiya LoGaN
<LoGaN> hi Caramel Faramir Nittany_Discord prince-dari Saturn Shizuka SlurryMoon Sumica Tom Wrek BerryPunch and Phase4 .
<Reikim> Exploit?
<prince-dari> Ohai
<LoGaN> otakon: wat?
<otakon> argh more lag
<fluttershyFTW> pew pew pew
<otakon> nvm
<Meanwhile> Ordinarily I'd have triggered the "Colours are for mods" kick script.
<Reikim> I'm well familiar with that one.
<LoGaN> otakon: i was only banned for 2 hours and that was 5 moths ago
<Reikim> So why didn't you?
<Meanwhile> Because I'm magic.
<Colt_magnum> So I just saw the odd life of timothy green. AWESOME POSSUMS! U guys should check it out.
<otakon> LoGaN: but what about the 24 hour ban you just got the other day?
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> kirz why didn't he trigger the kickscript?
<Colt_magnum> Did any1 else see the movie?
<Major> prince-dari: so can I ask you a question? :3
<LoGaN> Shizuka: how is that spamming?
<kirz|art> current scripts being used don't check /me messages
<prince-dari> Go ahead
<fluttershyFTW> ..
<MASF123> Damn.....son.
<fluttershyFTW> pew peww pew
<Reikim> ...Huh.
<Meanwhile> I'd tell you but I don't really want to be responsible for spreading How-to's on avoiding chat rules.
<kirz|art> but if you do it and it's noticed you'll get kicked manually
<Nyst> Cute robots
<Thrackerzod> the fuck am i looking at?
<Meanwhile> Seems kirz is fine with it though. ^^
<Major> prince-dari: are you anything besides a brony? x3
<otakon> Colt_magnum: I missed
<Reikim> Well, there's the manual fallback.
<kirz|art> <--not a mod any more :P
<prince-dari> Male?
<Reikim> That's kind of why we have mods to begin with.
<otakon> Major: he's a smarmy brit that LOVES Matt Smith
<fluttershyFTW> :O DR WHOOF
<prince-dari> What does that question even mean? :P
<Colt_magnum> otakon aw thats too bad. :/ I just saw it today and its a pretty nice movie.
<otakon> :P
<kirz|art> I'm just explaining why it didn't kick
<Caramel> Dari: you sure about that? :P
<Dovah> sometimes I forget everyone here is a brony :p
<Reikim> Thanks kirz, you're very helpful.
<prince-dari> Caramel: For you, I might reconsider. (;
<fluttershyFTW> 6_9
<Dovah> well mostly everyone there may be a few exeptions
<otakon> Colt_magnum: I own all of the LotR's on BR and they are the EC's
<Colt_magnum> The reviews for it will just ruin it for you though, dont see any reviews until u see it.
<Meanwhile> Still, I didn't get manualled because no one was paying attention.
<Major> prince-dari: I mean are you like a furry or something? x3
<otakon> Colt_magnum: I saw ParaNorman today, good movie
<Reikim> That or the mods were amused by your shenanigans.
<Caramel> Dari: Oh? I'm such a man that you look like a woman in comparison? Yeah, I can believe that
<Reikim> And they knew you were just making a point.
<fluttershyFTW> ......
<LoGaN> Shizuka: i said hi to the mods and explaned to otakon that i was banned a while ago how is that spamming?
<otakon> Caramel: dude we haven't even seen a pic of you have we?
<prince-dari> Well I'm not a furry, but if you want to know about a couple of things that I like I could tell you?
<Meanwhile> Either way. That's the short story of colour shenanigans.
<Caramel> otakon: and you never will
<otakon> LoGaN: it's a autokick, she's away
<Cypresswolf> I almost burned my hushpuppies :P still good thought - especially when dipped in steak sauce :) some rice on the side and green beans would be ideal with this, but too lazy to go to the store
<LoGaN> oh
<otakon> Caramel: well phooey
<Spectrum_Rush> LoGaN: you mass pinged the ops for no reason
<pwny> Who in here is a furry?
<fluttershyFTW> ....
<Major> prince-dari: sure x3
<Major> pwny: me x3
<Reikim> And what a tasty story it was.
<LoGaN> Spectrum_Rush: i said hi
<otakon> pwny: that is a question better left pm'd
<MLP_Brovakiin> I got really confused for a minute there, I thought that desktop pony was on my computer :P
<XylemTube> did tom finally beat that boss?
<LoGaN> Spectrum_Rush: :D mass pinged
<fluttershyFTW> ..
<XylemTube> whoop wrong window
<pwny> otakon: why?
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6440696064
<fluttershyFTW> ooooo
<fluttershyFTW> shiny
<kirz|art> it gets by because it's not being used often or abused, and most of the people on the channel don't know how to do colors in the first place
<fluttershyFTW> its sparkly
<Bronysith> well
<otakon> pwny: bc it's a touchy subject and stuff like that should be kept to yourself. Not that I care either way, do what you like as long as nobody get's hurt is my motto.
<fluttershyFTW> overkill
<prince-dari> Well in terms of games I like the original Spyros on PS1, the PoP trilogy, RDR. I love parkour/freerunning.
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony
<otakon> MOKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<prince-dari> I USED to like Doctor Who.
<Bronysith> fluttershyFTW: no such thing

<Meanwhile> Exacta.

<prince-dari> :P
<otakon> night Bronysith sleep well
<Spectrum_Rush> LoGaN: yes but there might be a kick script on that, maybe
<Alister> test
<Ponies47> Back :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Bronysith :3
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: there is no kickscript on emote spamming, just spamming 6 messages in 10 seconds
<otakon> hiya Alister
<fluttershyFTW> its a plane
<superretroworld> played tf2, i suck ass at it but its fun
<otakon> superretroworld: same here
<otakon> and my stream is DEAD
<otakon> there it goes
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: I know that but i've noticed that sometimes whenever someone mass pings the ops they'll get kicked
<prince-dari> otakon: Someone must have shot a couple of your carrier pigeons
<otakon> prince-dari: -____-
<prince-dari> DO HO HO
<Caramel> spectrum_rush: it's been a problem in the past
<otakon> I swear to the internet gods
<Colt_magnum> I almost CRIED during the Timothy Green movie. BUCK the critics, its a great movie! T_T

<fluttershyFTW> ITS OVER 9000
<Major> prince-dari: well I bet half of the chat doesnt even know what a Carrier Pigeon is :P

<Shizuka> 13what was that? "i'm a bad pony and need a noodling"?
<prince-dari> The name kind of implies.
<Meanwhile> Well they will if kirz feels the need to explain it in mane.
<Reikim> prince-dari: He lags, long and hard.

<prince-dari> Reikim: Ahahaha, yes
<Major> prince-dari: well then again it could be ANYTHING @_@

<prince-dari> Amazing.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Major : iknow what a carrier Pidgeon is, apparently my grand dad used to train them :)
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Shizuka> 13could have sworn i heard it
<pwny> Ugh, My computer bluescreened so i had to restart it
<prince-dari> Did your pshycic abilities tell you how to spell psychic?
<Reikim> Now, some might /want/ a noodling, but that's none of our concern.
<Reikim> And they can PM you for it.
<prince-dari> pwny: Look up the error code?
<otakon> argh
<Meanwhile> Heh, "PM for a noodling".
<fluttershyFTW> I HAVE NO CLUE
<Pink3> what is this???
<otakon> pwny: that is not good, run maintenence

<Meanwhile> But then he's been kicked by more spambot-scipts than anyone else ever.
<kirz|art> lol

<otakon> Shizuka: it was in bronystate, LoGan was pinging you
<otakon> Meanwhile: har har
<Meanwhile> For spamming too many years on earth
<Pink3> What is this???

<MLP_Brovakiin> Major: unfortunaly you would have to find a ghost whisperer :(
<otakon> YOU CAN'T HIT THE CHEAPEST BOT IN THE GAME!
<MASF123> What happened to Mips?

<Meanwhile> YOU'D be happier?

*Reikim laughs and slaps his knee
<kirz|art> so why are we comparing sizes now?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Major: Wow, I'l be honest I didn't know there was a war in Korea :P
<Meanwhile> Because otakon mentioned my height.
<Reikim> Because otakon started making fun of Meanwhile.
<fluttershyFTW> :o
<Major> wat
<otakon> lol
<Major> WAT
<fluttershyFTW> korean war 2
<Reikim> We have established that Meanwhile is short and skinny, otakon is short and stout, and I'm trying and failing to make a phallic innuendo out of this.
<MirrorImage> MLP_Brovakiin - it's not really a "war" right now; it's more of an angry standoff with guns
<otakon> -_____-
<Barbetos> HORRY SHEEITT!!

<kirz|art> ------Otakon is now the Hobbit of Bronystate---- Discuss :3
<Meanwhile> Speculate on the better points of elvish rope.

<kirz|art> and how much Lembas bread is too much
<fluttershyFTW> did i miss the pink one kicking *squee*
<Meanwhile> ...You know what if Saturn can do BUCK I say we can do Hobbitkon.

<Pinkies4thWall> Hi, everypony!
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Pinkies4thWall
<CrazyHippie1234> hulu
<Reikim> Special guest: otakon, the only-known real-life hobbit.
<kirz|art> I'm having nothing to do with a LOTR convention, that's just a bit too much :P
<Dovah> hi Pinkies4thWall
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Pinkies4thWall :)
<LoGaN> hi
<CrazyHippie1234> hi Pinkies4thWall
<LoGaN> hi

<fluttershyFTW> thats one hell of bot
<fluttershyFTW> pew pew pew
<fluttershyFTW> lazahs
<Meanwhile> Definitely one of the more amusing ones.
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont like robot designs with those floating minilazer things. why even have a mecha, why not just use the minilasers
<otakon> -_____-
<otakon> actually funny story
<otakon> I saw a hobbit at Otacon one year
<fluttershyFTW> i preffer the fighters rather than mechas
<otakon> very good costume, even was smoking a pipe.
<Kandarihu> They're remote controlled weapons by the newtype pilot piloting the mobile suit
<MASF123> bye y'all be back later
<Caramel> now for the attack that always causes an over-reaction from chat
<Reikim> And now I will forever have evidence that otakon is a hobbit.
<fluttershyFTW> thats the reason why
<Meanwhile> otakon's been hitting the pipeweed.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: obviously, im saying why even make a mecha if the minilasers are so powerful
<otakon> Boob missiles?
<fluttershyFTW> ok a fighter that turns into a mecha
<otakon> is it boob missiles?
<LoGaN> hi
<otakon> well I saw boobs
<fluttershyFTW> :O boob missiles
<Eulshy> oh this game again
<Nyst> I think she shot her hair.
<otakon> yes boob missiles
<otakon> Aphrodite A has them
<otakon> from Mazinger
<Meanwhile> Suddenly occured to me, LotR marked the end of the Trilogy event right?
<fluttershyFTW> :D AHAHAHA
<DerpyMuffins> So much overkill
<otakon> also, that robot maid from that one series
<kirz|art> "boob" pings otakon
<otakon> yes it did
<Reikim> Someday, otakon, I swear I'm going to pull out this convo in manechat and make it official that you are a hobbit.
<otakon> no it doesn't
<otakon> fine go ahead
<Meanwhile> otakon is a hobbit for best Bronystate meme 2013.

<Barbetos> Internet says it does so it must be true
<Pinkies4thWall> ALL HAIL THE INTERNET
<fluttershyFTW> ok i recovered from falling down from my chair
<Meanwhile> You say that now but when you get back and everyone says "Hi Hobbitkon" you know what you'll say?
<Reikim> Speaking of our favourite rage-machine...otakon is now a hobbit. This is now canon. No exceptions.

<otakon> DerpyMuffins: NO.SUCH.THING.
<otakon> The only good kill IS overkill
<DerpyMuffins> Is there any other kill?
<Barbetos> I remember getting the overkill notice in Final Fantasy 10. It always made me happy.
<fluttershyFTW> yeep this one
<MirrorImage> DerpyMuffins - "Nuke it from high orbit"

<Reikim|Writing> Saved for posterity.
<Caramel> kandarihu: I honestly wish you'd stop saying stuff like that. My machine that uses mirc is dead and I'm forced to use our website's embedded client. But thanks for reminding me of the multiple hundreds of dolors I need to spend just to recover the hard drive I need for school in a week
<kirz|art> also, shouldn't he be the one on the far left?
<Reikim|Writing> Saved forever.

*NocturnalBlade bows "Hello PillowPoni "
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, spitfire will be turned off at some point but its up untill the MvM hype dies down
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You should put MLP Heroes on one of those instead of MvM. Anyway, I can't get on the empty one.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: K.
<Ponies47> Yay to MLP heroes! :D
<Reikim|TF2> YA-HA
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, i wish, mlp heroes seems to be closed
<Phase4> 00,02i plan to ask the ponyfortress guys at some point
<Phase4> 00,02dislike their map rotations
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, the PF2 servers are down.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd still love to play MLP Heroes even with MvM going on.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I need to build up XP so I can play as a pony one time.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Wait the PF2 servers are down!?! :O

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: Agreed.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Strange. I played on one last night and it seemed fine :/
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, also you should be able to play as a pony right off the bat, just need to opt-in

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can see default sprays in the TF2 file browser, but I can't see them in Windows explorer.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Yeah, I think.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Derpy_Hooves: Sure.

<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, !pf2
<Derpy_Hooves> preferably i'd like this as a placeholder http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VazV36eWHLc :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can see other people's sprays.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sometimes, they appear as those magenta and black checkered patterns.
<XylemTube> this seal is cute :3

<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: They say the new LOTR is better, because there is more character development, and it follows the book to a T, HE praised the animation of the old LOTR movie, it was ahead of it's time
<flutter_spin> I tried playing this. It was hard.
*Ponies47 Is confused by sonicandmario85 now
<Slenderman> Dat lag
<AJIsAwesome> BRB.
<sonicandmario85> Ponies47:they are in north america

<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: yeah good point
<AJIsAwesome> JRP: Wait let me guess! Was that a duck?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> its absurd this one guy I was playing with last night upgraded his Beggers Bazooka so it could load 9 rockets at like the speed of light
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: btw, though i never saw the Old LOTR, i kinda regret not seeing it, because of the animation, and take on the story. But The New LOTR is better.
<AJIsAwesome> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Sheesh.:O
<Kimori> he looks like a badass
<flutter_spin> You have seen Lotr Old vs Lotr New video, right?
<AJIsAwesome> PaladinDrakkenwolf: You can upgrade up that far?
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Yeah.
<Slenderman> DAT LAG
<vCades> totally :P
<Slenderman> I hate it
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> AJIsAwesome: well the guy last night did it
<Dark92Enigma> flutter_spin: You bet i did!
<flutter_spin> First time I found out there WAS another lotr movie
<Dark92Enigma> PaladinDrakkenwolf: WHAT IT WAS STREAMED YESTERDAY?
<vCades> i really want that as my wallpaper
<flutter_spin> heh, didn't know that
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: It wasn't.
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: well its always good to give a chance, but peter jackson may had some luck getting a few ideas from the animated ones
<vCades> SHIBARU
<shibaru> Hi.
<flutter_spin> I tried playing this as a new guy with no special items. It didn't like me.
<shibaru> Every time I came here, noone else was :(
<vCades> sorry :P
<shibaru> Lol
<flutter_spin> Oh and as a sniper. I don't think this style approves of snipers
<Dark92Enigma> flutter_spin: IKR? How they could've fuck that up!.... Why Bashki's wasn't the director again? It was too dumb to be an LOTR movie
<AJIsAwesome> What trilogy do you think we should watch next for next year's summer?
<vCades> have u ever seen prince dari here?
<shibaru> I have married Mike on the sims and we have a beautiful baby boy c:
<shibaru> Nope
<vCades> LOL
<shibaru> So much funny shit has happened on there lol
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: indiana jones maybe
<sonicandmario85> i dont buy items i find them on TF2 i ave lots including the sandvich XD
<sonicandmario85> have*
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: True.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> taaaaaaaannnnkkkk!!!
<flutter_spin> Joining in a round and losing each wave was very discouraging
<Slenderman> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: And some of them were improved by him. But the battle in the animated one was a classic (according to what i saw in NC's review)
<vCades> i remember one time somebody died and this one girl couldnt stop whining haha i wanted to kill her
<Kimori> hey shibaru
<Kimori> ...what the
<sonicandmario85> one time in TF2 before mann vs machine i ate a sandvich infront of a guy and he was like:Wtf?
<Kimori> seriously you did that?
<sonicandmario85> XD
<vCades> what?
<sonicandmario85> he was also new LOL
<Ponies47> Dat Ed :P
<shibaru> Like I was on a date with Mike and I thought that the food was taking a really long time to get to the table so I looked over at the kitchen and the chef was trying to walk through the counter but it was in his way for some reason and he kept doing that until I left and I could see flies around the plate XD
<vCades> no im talking about the sims kimori not irl :P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> "have a bonus"
<flutter_spin> Well, I don't like pvp. It's the only reason why I tried MvM
<flutter_spin> But it is so hard.
<vCades> XD
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: or to make things worse, g1 through g3 of mlp
<vCades> sims ai
<Kimori> I know that
<sonicandmario85> flutter_spin:even in mvm the bots troll you
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Besides STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES, TOY STORY, and NAKED GUN and ALL OF THE REST?.....all of them
<Dken2021> I just realized, Austin powers has three movies
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: I would like to see Neverending Story again, though
<flutter_spin> I don't care if a bot trolls me. As long as it isn't versus other players.
<sonicandmario85> why?
<shibaru> And then the butler kept picking up the garbage, walking two steps, dropping the garbage, picking the garbage up, walking two steps back, dropping it... XD
<Dark92Enigma> Dken2021: OMG! Make that for next year
<sonicandmario85> its the same as it exept with bots
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: It was good until 3.
<flutter_spin> people who beat me tend to rub it in
<vCades> lol
<flutter_spin> bots can't do that.
<Dken2021> also 34 mins until square unveils a world ends with you sequel or something
<shibaru> Mike grabbed a plate of food, walked in the direction of the table, put the plate down, and grabbed another plate
<vCades> haha
<Dken2021> a whipping crowbar, only in TF2
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: when did you guys watch the neverending story?
<Ponies47> Dken2021: eeyup :P
<flutter_spin> awhile back
<JRP> SuperBrony64: hjfjhjdjdjdhdjhdjjddh stands for apple
<shibaru> Oh and every time Mike is in downtown, someone always seems to get stuck somewhere XD
<flutter_spin> pony up?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pony up
<AJIsAwesome> PONY UP?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: N.S. 1 = Classic. N.S. 2 = Not as good as the original, but it has it's moments N.S.= EPIC FAIL
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yup
<Dken2021> yea, you heard him
<MLP_Brovakiin> There ain't nothing quite like a bowl of cereal and a pint of milkshake at half five in the morning :D

<flutter_spin> And you definitely need a variety of classes
<vCades> that was pretty fun
<Dken2021> sonicandmario85 wah wah waaah

*Ponies47 Ties ShadowQuill to a chair "CALM THE BUCK DOWN!" :[
<flutter_spin> Well, there didn't seem to be a goal for me in MvM. Losing every round just made it all feel kind of futile.
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: THE BUCKING DOWNLOAD
<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: Dat sucks :<
<ShadowQuill> IT TAKES TOO LONG!
<Ponies47> :<
<sonicandmario85> when i get my new laptop and play TF2 on it im probaly gonna find one of those rainbow trumpets that are actually flame throwers by killing someone and then dying as usal XD

*AJIsAwesome hands ShadowQuill a muffin "Patience, my friend."

<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: I don't think I added you on Steam :$
<Ponies47> sonicandmario85: Me to :3
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: That means it went all the way from one hour twenty nine minutes to one hour twenty SEVEN minutes IN 20 MINUTES?! What form of discord is this?!
<sonicandmario85> Ponies47:i found it i didnt buy it i have no bought items i just collected some by killing other people and then dying XD
<ShadowQuill> I feel like crazy Twilight...
<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: That sucks. What's your Steam name so I can add you?
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: Shadow Surge. It's a mix of my OC (this screen name) and my hero, Surge.

<sonicandmario85> i was talking about the updated network thing XD
<flutter_spin> I glanced over a guide on how to win MvM. I read "You must have X" where X is an unlockable tool
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: LOL AWESOME
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Have you heard him sing "Winter Wrap Up"
<Wolfmane> just wondering, can your internet connection make the stream bad quality? Or is it for everyone.
<flutter_spin> Simply put, it's stupid for new players
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Nope. But he's a friend of mineon STeam :P
<vCades> ah nevermind, not funny anymore :P
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Just to let you know, his name is Baconhair.
<Dken2021> "DOMINATED! But you're a good man and I love ya"
<sonicandmario85> i wonder what would happen if someone hacked TF2 and made everyones weapons overpowerd XD
<ShadowQuill> One hour fourteen minutes. It's speeding up! (I would put crazy Twilight face here! IF WE HAD ONE!)
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I know! I found him and friended him on Steam! :D
<Petrified_Discord> Wolfmane: Yup, it can. But sometimes it's like it for everyone.

<superretroworld> im not much into dubstep, but i have to admit, i like the song first of the year
<flutter_spin> Be fun if you could do like 5 snipers, 1 medic for MvM. Why must there be a variety of classes?
<AJIsAwesome> Major: How is it being the engineer?
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I think he was drunk when we made that trade. I traded 2 nametags and 2 buckets of paint for, The Sandvich, a bat for the Scout (It's a gaint candy cane), Somthing for Spy and I think a new gun for the Sniper :P
<Dken2021> flutter_spin be kinda lame with just one class
<Major> AJIsAwesome: it takes some skill but its not too bad :P
<LoGaN> SuperBrony64: moopy says waz up?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I love his drunken stupor so much. I wish I could sing those songs with him.......
<flutter_spin> Just seems like, to win, you need each class.
<JRP> Me and SuperBrony64 are being silly.

<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: You guys shouldn't spam.

<vCades> i laughed at that
<Barbetos> I DON'T LIKE SPAM!!
<Ponies47> *Hey
<AJIsAwesome> LoGaN: Gabe Newell can't count to three.
<Barbetos> That is what the kick bot should tell people
<LoGaN> SuperBrony64: moopy said did you guys miss me?
<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome:HEY THATS WHATS HOLDING UP HL3
<MirrorImage> Huzzah! Team Caramel was successful at the Advanced mission on Mannworks
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: Eeyup.

<Ponies47> LoGaN: Your talking about that xxMoopyxx guy correct? :|
<LoGaN> yes
<Kimori> this ones a bit geeky but if you get it then good for you :P
<Sylandest> im not sure i understand what is being streamed atm...
<PillowPoni> Spam is delicous. Goes good with rice and baked beana
<Reikim|TF2> All right, we survived Mannworks on Advanced. I am proud.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Who's this xxMoopyguyxx?
<vCades> yo thats sick :P
<Ponies47> LoGaN: How did you find him? O.O
<Barbetos> Reikim|TF2 we made up the dream team
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We-sCBmi8hY&feature=related
<Reikim|TF2> Ponies47: Someone sho's been on here more than once.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Old bronystater who got the ban hammer
<Reikim|TF2> Barbetos: /)
<LoGaN> he on xbox
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: What did he do?
<Barbetos> Reikim|TF2 we should do it again sometime (\
<Reikim|TF2> What did Moopy get the banhammer for?
<Reikim|TF2> MirrorImage: /)
<Dken2021> moopy? I think I mremeber him
<flutter_spin> for mooing?
<Ponies47> Reikim|TF2: and AJIsAwesome he keept picking fights with the mods. Most of the time being Wrek :|
<superretroworld> theres a handmade discord plush on ebay for $70
<vCades> whaaaaaa...
<Barbetos> One does not simply moop into Mordor.
<vCades> how is that even possible?
*Celes_Chere is feasting on cottage cheese and potato chips, *yum* :P
<sonicandmario85> also people can probaly use other computers to get on here if their banned
<shibaru> Ponies
<Kimori> a computer programmer can do this
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I know this is dragging on, but how would he pick fights?
<Kimori> you just have to know how
*Ponies47 Has Pringles :3
<sonicandmario85> i dont have another computer
<superretroworld> Ponies47: who?
<Buytoast> oh wow, this seal video is still going on?
<Reikim|TF2> sonicandmario85: The mods will just reban them.
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos: One does not simply MOOP in Bronystate.
<Celes_Chere> Buytoast: hit refresh
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: By being a jerk whining and complaining trash talking Ect :|
<sonicandmario85> Reikim|TF2:what if they have undreds of computers?
<Buytoast> ah
<vCades> i guess
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Ok. Thanks for letting me know.
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Old bronystater who got banned by the name of xxMoopyxx
<Reikim|TF2> sonicandmario85: It's easy to change an IP. You don't even have to change computers. But it's hard to regain the mods' trust. They'll just keep banning you.
<Celes_Chere> I had it running for an hour before I realized
<Barbetos> AJIsAwesome indubitably.
<Reikim|TF2> sonicandmario85: For more details, ask an actual mod. Like Shizu.
<Buytoast> advanced difficulty is so very very painful
<Reikim|TF2> But fun.
<Buytoast> oh yes
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: Losing a mod's trust is the fastest way to lose a mod.........FOREEEEEEEEEVER!
<Reikim|TF2> We got the perfect team combination.
<superretroworld> Ponies47: oh, i may remember him
<sonicandmario85> Reikm|TF2:and you can just keep on changing ips untill they decide to give up because youll just keep doing it and doing it
<Reikim|TF2> sonicandmario85: Again, I think the mods have their ways around that. Ask them if you must.
<Ponies47> superretroworld: He was a jerk. Never really liked him :|
<sonicandmario85> thats probaly what a troll would do XD
<JRP> Aaaaaa
<Reikim|TF2> I remember Moopy...vaguely.
<JRP> Do what you want cuz a pirate is free. You are a pirate
<sonicandmario85> Reikm|TF2:what if they think your a new user?
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: They're mods. You think they're gonna give up? This is bronystate. He shouldn't have been trash talking here anyways.
<Barbetos> Scout (for getting the monies) Sniper (for jarate slows) Heavy (for zee damage) Engi (for more damage) Medic with kritz (for even MOAR damage) and Demo (for dam... you get the idea.)
<Reikim|TF2> Moopy...I don't remember much about him.
<Shizuka> 13and phlog shizu for the massively OP
<flutter_spin> Barbetos: lol, that sums up the reddit review post I just read
<Reikim|TF2> Sniper piss is overpowered
<Reikim|TF2> But yes, a Shizu on any team is OP.
<vCades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOb6Z5Tja68&feature=related
<vCades> skip to 8:15
<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome:you could probaly just make the mods think your a new user with a new ip and yyouve been banned
<AJIsAwesome> DAT FLAME RAINBOW.
<sonicandmario85> but dont tell them you were banned
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: Let's stop talking about this.
<sonicandmario85> OKEY DOKEY LOKEY
<Barbetos> sonicandmario85 and we call that ban evasion
<Reikim|TF2> Shizuka: How's it going over on Nyx?
<Barbetos> What about Nyx now?
<flutter_spin> Just weird that sniper is only good for his side-tool
<Reikim|TF2> Phase's other server, Barbetos.
<Barbetos> Sniper is support
<PillowPoni> Welp going to bed guys. Niiigjt
<Reikim|TF2> Sniper can bag medics and heavies.
<Reikim|TF2> Night PillowPoni
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Really? I thought his main weapon would deal the most damage.
<superretroworld> night PillowPoni
<Shizuka> 13need drink
<NocturnalBlade> awwww, nite PillowPoni
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni: Night! :)
<flutter_spin> I was all running around sniping heads and... yeah, I felt useless
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Black box is really good in this mode with it's health regen on hit.
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: sweet dreams
<Reikim|TF2> Sniper's only really good for jar slows and picking off stragglers.
<sub06905|Zzz> well im off to bed night everypony :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> G'night PillowPoni
<flutter_spin> or sniping other snipers
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905|Zzz: Night!!!!
<Barbetos> Night sub06905|Zzz
<NocturnalBlade> Nittany_Discord: true, i dont think Natasha would be bad either, slowing every bot down
<NocturnalBlade> nite sub06905|Zzz
<MLP_Brovakiin> And also sub06905|Zzz
<Sumica> 00,10never noticed that thermin noise when you mouse over the charicters
<Ponies47> Nighty night sub06905|Zzz :)
<flutter_spin> lol, really Sumi?
<MirrorImage> Sumica - i think it's guitar chorsts, actually
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Natasha with barrel spin up is great as well.
<MirrorImage> but it's only new as of the last update
<Reikim|TF2> Aaaany takers for MvM?
<Ponies47> Sumica: Smae here until now :/
<Shizuka> 13MirrorImage: theremin on mvm
<Ponies47> *same
<MirrorImage> and i prefer Brass Beast over Natascha in MvM because of the tanks
<Barbetos> lol
<Cypresswolf> I'm off to bed - been fun watching the stream - Goodnight all
<PillowPoni> Nocturnal|Blade : Natascha*
<flutter_spin> No thanks. I don't think I want to try and get into MvM
<Barbetos> Introducing the TF2 keyboard
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Night!:)
<Reikim|TF2> MirrorImage: You staying on, or taking a break?
<MirrorImage> let the snipers slow stuff down, you just kill them
<vCades> aww :3
<MirrorImage> it's 1am reikim and i have work tomorrow
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Cypresswolf :)
<Reikim|TF2> Aha
<MirrorImage> i SHOULD be in bed right now
<Reikim|TF2> Night then
<MirrorImage> key word: *should*
<NocturnalBlade> Nittany_Discord: might actually have some use for my strange natasha then lol
<flutter_spin> I'm new. What use would I be in MvM?
<Reikim|TF2> I get the same thing...8:00 shift? stay up to three!
<MirrorImage> flutter_spin - if you can keep a sentry alive, you could pass as engineer
<MirrorImage> Reikim|TF2 - the nice thing for me is that i work second shift
<shibaru> Lots of youtube
<MirrorImage> so i don't work until 1pm
<MirrorImage> but still
<Reikim|TF2> flutter_spin: You would be taking heavy with rage, fire speed, and penetration.
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: http://imgur.com/lkZ0r
<Ponies47> Hye flutter_spin. Did I add you on Steam?
<NocturnalBlade> seems legit
<Ponies47> *Hey
<MirrorImage> AJIsAwesome - aayep
<MLP_Brovakiin> I should also be going to bed now, it is 6am :D good night everybody :3
<flutter_spin> No body has added me to steam. I don't usually go on steam.
<Reikim|TF2> We could use an experienced pyro, though.
<Ponies47> Nighty night MLP_Brovakiin :)
<NocturnalBlade> nite MLP_Brovakiin
<MirrorImage> MLP_Brovakiin - well then, good... morning?
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Night! :)
<vCades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2CatTUUKCU
<vCades> :O
<NocturnalBlade> Reikim|TF2: if i could join then i could help
<sonicandmario85> the only game on steam i play on this crappy computer is the worms reloade demo
<Barbetos> Ah the world of TF2.
<Reikim|TF2> NocturnalBlade: Sweet, I'll PM you the server info.
<flutter_spin> I'll join and do whatever. Just expect me to have nothing :P
<MirrorImage> NocturnalBlade - they could probably use another Heavy assuming they didn't replace me
<sonicandmario85> reloaded*
<flutter_spin> Need server info and all that
<NocturnalBlade> Reikim|TF2: what do you mean by experienced?
<Reikim|TF2> NocturnalBlade: Good with airblast, not dying, etc.
<MirrorImage> NocturnalBlade - can you properly identify priority targets?
<NocturnalBlade> MirrorImage: maybe, i can focus on what people tell me to XD
<Ponies47> flutter_spin: I'll add you. Steam name pwease? :3
<vCades> the grey man i did doesnt seem so amazing anymore, eh?
<ShadowQuill> 48 MINUTES
<flutter_spin> czar456
<MirrorImage> so long as your bullets are flying the same way as everyone elses, you should be fine
<NocturnalBlade> MirrorImage: true lol
<ShadowQuill> *
<MirrorImage> who is streaming?
<ShadowQuill> NO WAIT DO NOT PASTE THIS
<MirrorImage> who is the bad spy not using a Big Earner?
<flutter_spin> looks like Nit
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord
<MirrorImage> don't use a regular knife
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What should I use?
<MirrorImage> use the big earner - gets you cloak AND health once you apply that upgrade
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Paste what?
<MirrorImage> ideally, you'd use a dead ringer as well
<ShadowQuill> AJIsAwesome: I just pasted what I had copied lol
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Ok.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have a dead ringer.
<Reikim|TF2> Nittany_Discord: ?
<sonicandmario85> the TF2 keyboard XD
<MirrorImage> eh, good enough thern
<ShadowQuill> AJIsAwesome: I'm gonna try again. Hold on.
<Reikim|TF2> Nittany_Discord: Cloak n Dagger and Big Earner.
<ShadowQuill> Tb. Tb. :$$b. $$$b. :$$$$b. :$$$$b. :$$$$$$b :$$$$$$b $$$$$$$b $$$$$$$b $$$$$$$$b :$$$$$$$b :$$$$$$$
<MirrorImage> so long as pyros don't get you, you have a great escape route
<ShadowQuill> O_O
<MirrorImage> stab stab stab to recharge your cloak, then cloak to run like a little screaming girl
<Shizuka> 13....
<ShadowQuill> WTF WAS THAT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have Cloak and Dagger
<ShadowQuill> DAMMIT SLENDER
<superretroworld> whenever i think pyro, i think gyro
<MirrorImage> dang it Nittany_Discord... one sec
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01ShadowQuill: Please don't spam.
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Be careful. You could get kicked for spam. I know you didn't mean it.
<ShadowQuill> Nittany_Discord: I just pasted what I had copied...
<Shizuka> 13why
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's spam.
<Shizuka> 13under what circumstances would you think that's a good idea?
<NocturnalBlade> gimme a bit Reikim|TF2 and i'll be on
<sonicandmario85> Nittany_Discord:he accidently did it
<ShadowQuill> idk...
<ShadowQuill> Sorry.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<Shizuka> 13nitt can have my big earner, but dun have extra watches
<ShadowQuill> Must... wait... longer...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have a Big Earner.
<MirrorImage> i have an extra cloak and dagger if you'd like that Nittany_Discord
<ShadowQuill> 44 mins
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just no extra watches.
<Reikim|TF2> Whatever you do though, Nitt, don't take the Eternal Reward.
<MirrorImage> though dead ringer is much more effective if you can get it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MirrorImage: Sure.
<Reikim|TF2> Cloak and sap like hell. Max sapper first.
<MirrorImage> Reikim|TF2 - i actually do one point of Health/Kill on the first wave
<MirrorImage> then waves 2 and 3, i dump into sapper
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might not stick with Spy. I find I die too often.
<Reikim|TF2> I dunno, I've never played spy.
<ShadowQuill> ShadowQuill: Hey, me! How am I doing?
<Reikim|TF2> I played a game with Meanwhile once, though, and he destroyed with maxed sapper.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't like Scout and Spy because they're so fragile.
<ShadowQuill> ShadowQuill: I'm not doing too good, me. I'm going crazy
<MirrorImage> the first wave, you can get away with no sapper
<NocturnalBlade> so Reikim|TF2 whats the server info...cause when i start tf2 i gotta leave here
<MirrorImage> second wave is ehh...
<MirrorImage> third wave is stupid easy once you get the sapper upgraded
<sonicandmario85> for some reason when i extent my left leg my knee cap cracks but its no big deal i dont feel it crack
<sonicandmario85> extend*
*AJIsAwesome gives ShadowQuill a persim berry
<ShadowQuill> For some reason when I hear this I think Winter Wrap Up
<ShadowQuill> AJIsAwesome: What are those
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: You mean it pops?
<Ponies47> Dun dun dun dun dun
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Pokemon reference. THey heal confusion.
<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome:yes
<ShadowQuill> AJIsAwesome: lol
<superretroworld> ShadowQuill: i dont see any similarity at all
<lowfn> Gotta sleep. Bai everypony!
<ShadowQuill> superretroworld: Then I am crazy.
<NocturnalBlade> nite lowfn
<superretroworld> night lowfn
<AJIsAwesome> lowfn: Night!
<Ponies47> Nighty night lowfn :)
<ShadowQuill> Just a little bit of it
<sonicandmario85> my legs pop alot so do my arms sometimes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How do you play Spy? You can't backstab until your cloak is gone.
<sonicandmario85> when i extend them
<ShadowQuill> sonicandmario85: You are telling us this why? Same happens with my knees
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> disguse
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - you can uncloak at any point
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> sappper is more useful for MvM
<MirrorImage> you don't have to wait for your cloak to expire
<sonicandmario85> ShadowQuill:im not asking why it must because im putting it in a awkward positsion also
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it takes a while for cloak to deactivate.
<ShadowQuill> 29 minutes
<XylemTube> Phlog is possibly the Best MvM weapon
<ShadowQuill> 39 I mean
<superretroworld> what is this dubstep or techno?
<MirrorImage> as long as you're diguised and not on fire, the bots don't pay attention to you
<MirrorImage> all you have to do is break line of sight and you can rush back in to backstab
<MirrorImage> and if they don't "see" you backstab someone else, they don't turn around to see you undiguised
<ShadowQuill> This music is hurting me.
<ShadowQuill> SPEAK
*ShadowQuill Ooh, italics!
*ShadowQuill is easily amused
<superretroworld> ShadowQuill: how do you switch to italic?
<ShadowQuill> superretroworld: Use /me
*ShadowQuill is showing superretroworld how it works
*ShadowQuill derp derp derp
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: You don't. That's a command option. You type "/me"
<superretroworld> ShadowQuill: like this?
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: You can get kicked for spamming italics.
*sonicandmario85 HELLO
*ShadowQuill No, like this you silly noodle
<ShadowQuill> AJIsAwesome: OH because role play?
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Yes.
<vCades> did the grey man get you guys?
<ShadowQuill> AJIsAwesome: I see...
<Kimori> heading to bed
<Kimori> night peoples :P
*superretroworld testing
<vCades> alright cya
<JRP> Everyone hug sb64
<MirrorImage> someone go give Nittany_Discord a Dead Ringer
<superretroworld> got it
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: It works. But stop for now. You can get kicked for that.
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: okay
<sonicandmario85> wonder if there will ever be a green team on TF2
<Buytoast> never
<sonicandmario85> then it will be red vs green vs blue
<sonicandmario85> it would be nice to have 3 teams XD
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: They could team up after one team.
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: That would kill the point of 3 teams.
<JRP> Wrek I have a challenge for you
<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome:what if some noob on blu kills green XD
<Ponies47> sonicandmario85: That would be cool O.O
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: is role play banned on here or something?
<sonicandmario85> i mean on roblox in a war game on it there was 3 teams they didnt team up on 1 team
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: It isn't, but if you spam it too much you'll get kicked.
<flutter_spin> Question: What's TF2 Boot Camp?
<superretroworld> oh
<Buytoast> Boot Camp is pretty much normal mode mvm if i'm not mistaken
<flutter_spin> They made it sound like a completely different game :P
<sonicandmario85> BANANA POWER
<flutter_spin> Did you guys want me to join in?
<flutter_spin> oh, nevermind
<Buytoast> mann mode is an entirely new game
<Buytoast> well
<Buytoast> severely more difficult
<sonicandmario85> is the mode with just the blu and red team still on there?
<flutter_spin> but I need sleep. Alright, later. I need to throw some things away tomorrow with my mom away anyways
<Reikim|TF2> yYeah
<JRP> inkBot: are you made of ink and are you a bot?

<sonicandmario85> Sabershy:saberspark related name much?
<Sabershy> Yep, though honestly, I don't know who is Saberspark. From what poeple tell me, he is an important brony documentarist?
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: What's wrong with that?
<AJIsAwesome> Sabershy: Mostly yes.
<sonicandmario85> Sabershy:hes on youtube
<Sabershy> Oh.
<sonicandmario85> WHAT SICK MAN SEND BABIES TO FIGHT
<AJIsAwesome> Sabershy: Check him out on Youtube. He does livestreams and episode reviews as well sometimes.
<Sabershy> My name consists of two references: Saber belongs to Saber from Fate/zero and Fate/stay night and shy belongs to the last name of Fluttershy.
<sonicandmario85> Sabershy:he also does some brony music
<sonicandmario85> if only he knew about bronystate..
<sonicandmario85> im sure lots of bronys will visit this site when they find it XD
<superretroworld> sonicandmario85: i wonder if there are any celeb bronys in digusie
<ShadowQuill> Nittany_Discord: Is your YouTube by any change NittanyTiger1?

<thegt90> yes
<Kuma> Sabershy I have one.
<Eulshy> That didn't help me
<Sabershy> Sure. How can I help you, thegt90 and Kuma?
<thegt90> i cannot find a dual monitor mlp screen saver
<thegt90> all i keep getting is wallpapers
<Kuma> Sabershy hm... well... I need pony but I cant wait till season 3 comes, build me a time machine? :P
<Sabershy> thegt90: Have you tried having two screen savers for each monitor?
<Eulshy> nope, that page you posted didnt even load
<Eulshy> Sooooo
<thegt90> i dont think there is a free program that does that
<Sabershy> Kuma: Try reading fanfiction. It helps a bit in keeping "it" at bay. Just remember that none of the stories are canon. Some where so good, I ended up believing they were canon till I remembered they are fiction.
<Ponies47> Computer derp
<Kuma> Sabershy I was kidding though, I just need inspiration for art, nothing more ^^
<Eulshy> i'm bored and lonely still, oh well, such is life

<Sabershy> Ponies47: Wow, that is kinda... addicting.
<Ponies47> Sabershy: How so? O.O

<Eulshy> I spent just 5 hours on one and quir after the 16 wave 8 of 8
<AdamTheDuck> :'( *
<Sabershy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Personally, I would say xBox 360, but only for the fact that Halo 4 and Call of Duty has zombies.
<Kuma> Sabershy sorry for the late response ^^ hehe thats a good idea :D
<Jmo4267> Really AdamTheDuck, I mean really?
<Kuma> Eulshy its not hard ^^ you just need to right people with you~
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo4267: Yeah... After My Little Dashie... I've become a big softy :3
<Jmo4267> Not that, I mean response to Eulshy.
<Jmo4267> the^

<Jim> Excellent, I've got a new phone.
<Ponies47> Jim: Sweet. I need a new phone and a new computer. But mostley a new computer
<Eulshy> I need someting to do
<Jim> Decided it was time to upgrade from my old junkphone to a smartphone, because I will probably need something to browse the net on when I go into the army
<Ponies47> Jim: Lucky you got a Smartphone. I want a Smartphone. Forget Iphone's :P
<Jim> Nokia N9, it's quite decent
<Ponies47> My dad use to have this really awesome Smartphone I forget the model was but it was awesome until he left it on his trunk and drove off with out it inside the car. Now he's got a crappy Smartphone that he hopes to get rid of before the end of the year.
<Boltasar> we sure are taking our time with preparations
<Eulshy> I need someting to do, im boooooorrrreeed
<Jim> Bang your head in a wall
<Jim> That always helps for me
<Jim> Time flies when you bang your head into a wall
<Jim> Mostly because you knock yourself unconcious and wake up hours later
<Ponies47> Jim: XD
<Eulshy> Jim, i've tried that, and have given myself concussions and im not allowed to do it anymore
<Buytoast> time is for the weak

<The_Doctor> Barcelona, yes, we should all go to Barcelona; the Planet, not the country, very different the two, well, the food's quite the same

*Ponies47 Goes to bed
<Sabershy> A trick for me is to get really warm. Maybe because of more bloodflow, but I sorta have more dreams that way. Plus, geting an constant 7 to 9 hours of sleep everyday helps.
<AdamTheDuck> Sleep is for the weak :P
<Jim> Yes, why would we sleep if not for us being weak from not sleeping?
<AdamTheDuck> http://goo.gl/CLCGc
<AdamTheDuck> Not sure if the image will load though
<Jim> it loaded
<Sabershy> Jim: So I heard you like riddles... :P
<AdamTheDuck> I want to print an a2 poster of that
<AdamTheDuck> and pin it up on my wall so I can stay awake to finish the never ending maths homework
<Jim> Sabershy, So you put a riddle inside a riddle?
<Sabershy> Well, some of us would love being asleep, but are pretty much natural night owls.
<Agrold> what is this sleep thou art speakest of
<Sabershy> Jim: Didn't feel like finishing it, but I thought you would have gotten the idea. :)
<Jim> So just sleep during the day, no biggie
<AdamTheDuck> Yay we sparked a conversation!
<AdamTheDuck> annnnnnnnnnnd then chat died
<Jim> But it is kinda awkward to wake up at 5:30 pm
<Jim> Like I did yesterday
<Agrold> that's almost a bit late.. kinda
<The_Doctor> I hate waking up at night, seeing the sunset and thinking "damn, is it the morning?"
<Jim> Oh! You should experience that in Northern Norway during July!
<Jim> Because the sun never sets then, so you would have NO idea what time of day it is when you wake up
<Jim> since it's light out constantly
<Sabershy> That is different. I honestly can't sleep until I snuff any and all lights in my room.
<Sabershy> That and for some reason, my body wants a nap at 1 pm everyday, Sunday.
<Sabershy> *every Sunday.
<Jim> Dropdown curtains is a must
<Jim> I could not survive without them

<Sabershy> I wish I can play TF2. It looks interesting.
<Agrold> You haven't played TF2 before?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Jim maybe that guy was messin w/ Iron Will :D
<AdamTheDuck> So quiet...
<Agrold> indeed
<Sabershy> Nope. I never play any of that. Quite bluntly, I never heard of it reallt ill I came to Bronystate and saw a stream of people playing it.
<JRP> Hmm
<JRP> My heart felt like it stopped for a sec
<Agrold> Well, it's free to play, so you should check it out when you got time:)
<Agrold> JRP, oh?
<Sabershy> Cool. Well, everypony. I think it is time for me to sleep.
<AdamTheDuck> Night Sabershy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 6_9 just microwaved a slice pizza and a piece of pepperoni was gonna fall off so i pushed it back on to the pizza and it sounded like the pizza squeed for a sec lol
<Agrold> bye Sabershy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cya Sabershy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well im off 2 bed,cya everypony :)
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight to you too sketc- oh well...
<Gold_Demona> g'mornin' Bronystate
<Agrold> morning
<Gold_Demona> Wow, dead chat AND no stream? Odd.
<Agrold> yeah
<Agrold> I guess alot of people have started school/working now
<Gold_Demona> I guess so.
<Agrold> Or the zombieponies got to them first:o
<Gold_Demona> Though if I remember right, it's nighttime right now in Europe.
<Agrold> not really
<Gold_Demona> I could be wrong. =P
<Agrold> 11am in central europe now
<AdamTheDuck> Yay talking for once
<Agrold> :P
<Agrold> AdamTheDuck: wohoo
<Gold_Demona> I live in Florida, so I really have no idea what time it is in other places. XD
<Gold_Demona> Other than other time zones in the US
<Gold_Demona> Maybe I'm thinking of Austrailia. It's nighttime there, right?
<Agrold> I know that the US is behind europe, so it's probably early morning there now?
<Gold_Demona> It's 5am over here
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona: Lol no, it's 1907 hours
<Agrold> 1907=nighttime ;)
<Agrold> or.. maybe not:P
<Gold_Demona> 1907 = 7:07
<Gold_Demona> pm
<AdamTheDuck> Well considering it's winter, sun does go down earlier than summer
<Agrold> it's still night time.. for some people.. around the world.. somewhere
<AdamTheDuck> So I guess it is night :3
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Agrold> you're from australia, AdamTheDuck?
<AdamTheDuck> Eeyup
<Agrold> I've always wondered.. what is it like that have christmas in the summer?:P
<Gold_Demona> I've wondered that myself
<AdamTheDuck> Agrold: I could ask what having Christmas during winter is like as well :P
<Gold_Demona> But then again, I live in Florida, so I don't really know what it's like to have Christmas in winter either, lol. XD
<Agrold> AdamTheDuck: hehe true that
<AdamTheDuck> Considering I haven't even been in snow in my life yet :3
<Agrold> AdamTheDuck: Im from Norway, so I can send you some snow in the mail if you want some:P
<Agrold> (but it's nothing here right now tho)
<AdamTheDuck> Agrold: Haha :D
<AdamTheDuck> But yeah Christmas in summer kinda sucks for me
<AdamTheDuck> mostly because Australian summer gets really hot...
<Agrold> how how then?
<AdamTheDuck> can get up to 40 degrees celcius
<Agrold> oh my
<Agrold> :P
<AdamTheDuck> Not sure what that is in farenheit
<Gold_Demona> Christmas in Florida is pretty interesting. It's not as hot as the rest of the year, so it doesn't really qualify as summer weather, but it doesn't get nearly cold enough to qualify as winter.
<Gold_Demona> Could easily convert it real quick in google
<AdamTheDuck> But yeah, I think there was a heat wave of 3 days in a row of having a temperature of 40+
<Agrold> summers here only get to 30C.. if we're lucky:P
<AdamTheDuck> around last year
<Gold_Demona> Let's see. 40 C is about 104 F... Holy CRAP that's hot. O_o
<AdamTheDuck> My point exactly...
<thegt90> http://funnyjunk.com/channel/ponytime/Am+I+doing+it+right/qfaeGds/
<AdamTheDuck> lol
<Gold_Demona> That's an awesome picture of Twilight Sparkle. :3

<Gold_Demona> And Crackle is best dragon

<MASF123> The Slendermane pops up everytime there is no stream he causes it.
<olibacon> the site is for streamin ;_;
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, but nobody's streaming anything right now
<olibacon> lamesauce
<MASF123> This is Slendermane's doing.

<Mutterguy> Nah Mate, that'd be unhygenic
<MASF123> We should all hold hands....
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: The way she moves her mouth makes me think of Perry the Platypus

<thegt90> http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/4024830/10+interesting+pictures+on+Street+View/
<Gold_Demona> Well, that was weird. Chat plug-in broke on me
<CrimsonPhoenix> get an IRC client
<Gold_Demona> What's a good one for mac?
<Sumica> 00,10could check and see if mirc has a mac version
<Mutterguy> iunno google it
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear god
<Phase4> 00,02xchat, the one i use, has a mac version
<Spell-of-Gaming> I just saw the most horrible video game commercial ever
<Phase4> 00,02theres a fork called hexchat that is actively maintained
<Mutterguy> Spell-of-Gaming do tell
<Spell-of-Gaming> It was that Gameboy Micro commercial
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god.
<Phase4> 00,02i think i've figured out whats wrong with modern gaming/music/movies/television
<Spell-of-Gaming> CoDfags. :3
<MegaMoonShine> What is it phase?
<Phase4> 00,02originally it was 'give me money to perform my craft and you get the rights to sell it', or things were self funded and so on. creative projects were popular and made money
<Gold_Demona> Ohey! I just noticed there are mods in the chat. Hi mods.
<Spell-of-Gaming> They're one of the reasons why some Japanese games aren't being released/localized :3
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi
<Phase4> 00,02somewhere along the line it got flipped, investors pay to have a game/movie/song/show made, like its any other comodity
<Phase4> 00,02that simply doesnt work in a creative industry
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Well said
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wonder what would happen if we still have punch cards these days
<Phase4> 00,02zynga (i think, the guys who make farmvile) are a perfect example of this
<Spell-of-Gaming> ^
<Phase4> 00,02reducing the entire creative pipeline to a science
<Spell-of-Gaming> JAGUAR JAGUAR JAGUAAAAAAAAAAAAR
<Sumica> 00,10you know when ever tf2 has a new patch, I wish they would up the items per week limit
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not AGAINST using psychology or any other science to produce art, but just the science can only get you so far
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that would be nice
<Phase4> 00,02would throw the economy out of wack though
<Spectrum_Rush> yeah 7 drops every 2 weeks aint enough
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush, its 10 a week iirc
<Sumica> 00,1010 a week
<Sumica> 00,10ueasly at least 4 of them boxes
<Phase4> 00,02http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Item_drop_system
<alexxm> so is it 10 items per person or something
<Spectrum_Rush> close enough, always half are crates
<Phase4> 00,02its a fancy bit of statistics, you CAN get 12 but its unlikely
<Sumica> 00,10new version of theme song, I like it
<thegt90> im out guys night
<Phase4> 00,02no ones streaming?
<Sumica> 00,10feel like playing more MvM?

<Sumica> 00,10oki
<Gold_Demona> Ok, how do I find this chat in a client?
<alexxm> i just use bots like tom to get to differant chats
<Mutterguy> Ok what you need to is join the server irc.ponychat.net

<Phase4> 00,02ofna01, use mine :P
<DemoPegono> Just make your own server.

<ofna01> my dell
<Phase4> 00,02applebloom.ariscop.net nyx.ariscop.net and spitfire.ariscop.net
<ofna01> my dells video card may have died, and it had a virus
<ofna01> so yeah
<Phase4> 00,02spitfire seems to have the fewest problems, it has a bit more ram
<Phase4> 00,02password on all those servers is 'ponies', feel free to use them ^_^
<ofna01> how much RAM you got on those?
<Phase4> 00,02spitfire is 512MB, others are 256
<ofna01> my computer would explode if i tried to host
<Phase4> 00,02litterally doing nothing else so the servers squeeze into 256 nicely
<Gold_Demona> hm
<Phase4> 00,02load faster tf2
<ofna01> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i'm connecting to spitfire
<Sumica> 00,10ok

<ofna01> Phase, you got some graphical glitches it appears.
<Sumica> 00,10now if only phase would kill his game sounds and leave on his music =p
<ofna01> BALLOOOOOONICOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN

<lyrical> ;]]]]]]]]]
<ofna01> CRIT PYROS
<ofna01> oh god
<ofna01> regulars are bad enough
<killerpony7733> ofna01: Backburner pyro with maxed ammo cap and damage and what else with uber or crit canteens is pure destruction
<ofna01> why is there no share money feature in MvM?
<ofna01> that needs to be implemented
<AdamTheDuck> ofna01: Because money IS shared
<killerpony7733> ofna01: Ummm money is shared in the way everyone earns the shame amount of money. Though some may have a little left after getting a upgrade
<AdamTheDuck> In terms of picking up dosh, everyone gets a bit
<ofna01> DOSH
<ofna01> LOAAAAAADSA MONEY
<AdamTheDuck> Dosh here grab it while it's hot lads
<AdamTheDuck> MUNNAY MUNNAY MUNNAY
*ofna01 toshes dosh into fire
<ofna01> now it really IS hot :D
<AdamTheDuck> You're all fur coat no nickers bitches!
*ofna01 puts on nickers
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh what other horrible British accent qotes are from Killing Floor?...
<ofna01> tf2 is srs bsns people
<AdamTheDuck> quotes*
<ofna01> srs bsns
<Kandarihu> ofna01, it sure is
<ofna01> SPAH
<ofna01> wanna know what sucks?
<ofna01> my first MvM game, beat it, DIDNT GET CANTEEN
<AdamTheDuck> ofna01: Yeah same, got mine the next day though
<ofna01> BOINK
<AdamTheDuck> appeared out of nowhere in my inventory
<ofna01> i like robo-scouts
<d3rb> whats a canteen?
<AdamTheDuck> Daily wtf's, I already like the sound of that site
<AdamTheDuck> d3rb: You buy powerups like 5 seconds of uber or crits
<ofna01> CRIIIIIIIIIIIITS
<d3rb> ah...clearly the first time i have played mann vs machine
<d3rb> and tf2 in a long time
<ofna01> MvM is ossum
<ofna01> ossum possum
<Kandarihu> From my experience playing this as Engineer, one of the best possible ugrades is Melee speed. It lets me repair my sentry at high speeds.
<d3rb> i know, im gonna get back into tf2 just for this
<ofna01> KAnda
<ofna01> best possible upgrade combo IMO is mini sentry and sentry firing rate upgrade
<Kandarihu> Yes?
<AdamTheDuck> I wonder how many hours of tf2 Phase has played in the past half week :D
<Kandarihu> Well, the one time I did MvM, Sentry Firing Rate is one of the earlier upgrades I got.
<ofna01> DAT BOT TAUNTED U
<ofna01> lol
<Kandarihu> Dude, can you imagine a regular TF2 match in which everymerc has ALL of their MvM upgrades fully upgraded?
<ofna01> every person would be gpd
<ofna01> god
<ofna01> except medic
<Kandarihu> ofna01, but up against each other, though.
<ofna01> fully upgraded heavy
<ofna01> MEGUSTA
<XAX> Upgrading pointless shit to annoy Shamroc is fun.
<ofna01> eeeeyup
<XAX> Sure it's making me not be credit to team at all, but...
<Mutterguy> Steam LAUNCH HOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
<Mutterguy> *TF2 LAUNCH HOOOOOOOOOOO!
<ofna01> ENGINEER EES CREDIT TO TEAM
<AdamTheDuck> Mutterguy: SERVER FULL HOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<ofna01> my first game i played engie
<ofna01> and the loadout server was down
<ofna01> still kicked ass
<XAX> Knife wrapped in Christmas lights.
<ofna01> Yes.
<Kandarihu> Hmm, according to Steam, Phase4 has 54.1 hrs last two weeks / 344.0 hrs on record for TF2
<ofna01> 27 hours per week?
<ofna01> Dayum
<AdamTheDuck> Damn

<CriticKitten> It would be best lulz. :(
<XAX> hug*
<ofna01> Do not criticise epic streams

<Trollestia> fifty shades of grey is glorified twilight fanfic, and not even decent smut
<AJIsAwesome> It's disturbing and stupid at the same time how Fifty Shades of Grey came to be.
<AJIsAwesome> I don't even know why it should be popular.

<PillowPoni> Ponies_8989 I HAVE to watch out for them and I HAVE to geg my niece to tbe doctor for theese shots.
<Cypresswork> Kids in a car seat until the age of 10? That's quite excessive - and very rediculous. 10 years olds are large enough to fit in the seat without
<PillowPoni> Cypresswork I know right? And my niece is very tall for her age. By age ten kids wont fit into a car seat
<PillowPoni> Cypresswork only South Carolina =_(\
<Cypresswork> no doubt that concept was thought up by the same folk who think dodgeball is too violent or no one can ride a bike without 15 pieces of safety equipment
<ponies_8989> well that sucks
<Jmo4267> Dodgeball is too violent? ROfl
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<Jmo4267> Mornin' RaveBrony
*RaveBrony waves to Jmo4267
<Barbetos|AtWork> Morning RaveBrony
<PillowPoni> I couldn't agree more. I mean these same lawmakers played and roughhoused as kids and theh survived. Hell, we did as kids and we're fine.
<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: Morning!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello RaveBrony
<Cypresswork> at age 10 I had my own motorcycle and ran it into a thornbush once without a helmet
<PillowPoni> Morning RaveBrony
<ponies_8989> Mornin RaveBrony
<Barbetos|AtWork> Who won Cypresswork?
*RaveBrony waves to Barbetos|AtWork, AJIsAwesome, MLP_Brovakiin, PillowPoni, and ponies_8989 as well :$
<Cypresswork> Me, I came out with a really cool scar to show for it :)
<CCCP> hi RaveBrony
<Barbetos|AtWork> And now the ladies won't leave you alone.
<CCCP> Hi Cypresswork
<Barbetos|AtWork> OH HAI CCCP!
<Cypresswork> Hello CCCP how's your day going
<RaveBrony> Hiya CCCP! :)
<CCCP> good :3
<CCCP> hi Barbetos|AtWork
<CCCP> Cypresswork good :)
<PillowPoni> Barbetos|AtWork ladies love scars
<RaveBrony> :D
<Cypresswork> for all the "good ideas" I had growing up, I'm a walking wreck :D
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Cypresswork> :3 like the idea to have a jumping contest
<Barbetos|AtWork> Any Harry Potter fans here? You might find this hilarious: http://fuckyeahneville.tumblr.com/post/973414149/reasons-neville-is-a-bamf
<Cypresswork> ...from a tree
<PillowPoni> Cypresswork all the awesome stories
<ponies_8989> Neville the bawss
<ponies_8989> he gets all the b****s
<September> Bitches.
<September> Not that hard.
<ponies_8989> ikr
<PillowPoni> Barbetos|AtWork soook following that blog
<Barbetos|AtWork> That is the only funny thing on that blog
<Barbetos|AtWork> All the rest of it is pics of the actor mostly..
<Barbetos|AtWork> And you can tell its for fan girls
<ponies_8989> true that
<Barbetos|AtWork> mostly
<Barbetos|AtWork> 1. The Sorting Hat is no longer used at Hogwarts; students are sorted based on how long it takes them to cry in the presence of Neville Longbottom. < favorite
<RaveBrony> Barbetos|AtWork: Roflmao, that was great! :D
<Cypresswork> Our neighbors had several older brothers, one of them, Mike, told us (my brother Michael & me, and his bros Steven & Mathew) that you could see downtown houston if you climbed high enough up a pine tree - our pine trees are at least 4 stories tall - I tried climbing one in my front yard, I almost got to the trunk from the first branch some 12 ft above the ground and put my hand on a rotten branch and fell, landing on
<Cypresswork> note to self, put spaces between sentences O_o
<ponies_8989> ouch!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well at least it was not 20 feet
<Cypresswork> wasnt the first time I fell out of a tree, but one of the worst - knocked the wind out of me
<PillowPoni> Voldemort can't really fly. He only falls after Neville kicks him lololol
<Barbetos|AtWork> Okay. This is te last one I will post. 24. When Neville is in a duel, he doesn’t need to use Expelliarmus; he just walks up and takes his opponent’s wand.
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswork: Wow.:O
<RaveBrony> Barbetos|AtWork: Thats my fav :D
<ponies_8989> lol really?
<RaveBrony> I also really like 11 :D
<RaveBrony> Good read, haha
<Cypresswork> :) another good idea - I got into a roman candle fight with the son of a friend of my dad's - kids name was Adam - fight got out of control and I got burned in the chest, got a scar in its place
<Boltasar> well, that audiosurf demo didnt last long
<RaveBrony> Cypresswork: Well damn o_o
<Cypresswork> It seemed like a good idea at the time :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Cypresswork: Shit, you had one helluva childhood :D
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswork: Your childhood was awesome.:O
<killerpony7733> I once samcked a pointy hammer on my skull once >_<
<killerpony7733> smacked*
<Unnr> Allos all
<MaxTheBrony> heya Unnr :)
<ponies_8989> olla Unnr
*Unnr waves.
<AJIsAwesome> Unnr: Hi!
*Boltasar wishes steam would fix their proken price policy
<PillowPoni> Hello Unnr
<Boltasar> broken*
<MaxTheBrony> ponies_8989: get a nick :D it will become much easier for us to remember you :D
<Cypresswork> My parents weren't gonna hold my hand - they just let me do whatever, as long as I didnt burn the house down - so you want to stick a penny in the outlet? Try it out! ....yeah, hurt like hell, didn't it :) Don't do that no more
<ponies_8989> how should i do that?
*Unnr is geeking out, squeenix has a teaser site up hinting at a sequel to TWEWY.
<Boltasar> ./nick [redacted]
<PillowPoni> Cypresswork: all the best stories end with 'It seemed like a good idea at the time:
<Cypresswork> Learned the hard way :D
<ponies_8989> ./nick[redacted]
<ponies_8989> damn it
<Jmo4267> LOL
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Jmo4267> Without the . and [redacted]
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<Jmo4267> For example; /nick MaxTheBrony
<Boltasar> he did that on purpose...
<MaxTheBrony> exactly
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Boltasar> sometimes I wish I lived in Russia, so my steam games would be 1/3th the price or something the like...
<MaxTheBrony> O.O
<MaxTheBrony> meh, i think il stay in sweden and wait for the steam sale every year
<Boltasar> honestly, in europe you pay 10 for a $10 game, 50 for a $50 game
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Boltasar> yes in japan you do not pay 10 yen for a $10 game...
<Boltasar> yet*
<Jmo4267> >_>
<thelonepony> better
<thelonepony> change my nick
<Boltasar> still dont see why you dont know how to use /nick
<Jmo4267> Using yen as an comparison is poor >.>
<Jmo4267> a^
<Cypresswork> I learned not to play around cement birdbaths, how long to hold blackcats & M60's before they explode in your hand ( I wouldn't recomment it)...what else...
<Unnr> Cypresswork: M60´s aren´t so bad if you have your hand angled right
<Cypresswork> many evil tricks in a water war (that have nothing to do with water)
<Boltasar> ok Jmo4267, a 10us$ game is still not 10 rupiah
<Jmo4267> Still a poor comparison.
<Vivix> Oh god 18+ ad
<Jmo4267> HAY Vivix!
<MaxTheBrony> Whut?
<Vivix> HI!
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Vivix ! :D

<Vivix> I'm good, you?
<Jmo4267> I'm great :3

<Boltasar> looks like the mods are asleep, post humans
<thelonepony> well only chat isn't dead

*Vivix rests on pillow
<PillowPoni> Boltasar eww, humans

<Jmo4267> You never will. :>
<Cypresswork> Stormdrains is where all the runoff rainwater goes, pipes under the streets, some were big enough to walk in
<Jmo4267> ^
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<thelonepony> on* :P
<PillowPoni> thelonepony randomness. That's whats going on now
<thelonepony> i knew that>_>
<Cypresswork> I live on along a creek, so the pipe have to be huge to accomadate all the water, all the runoff flows to the creek
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> Cool- I've never seen a storm drain, I think-
<MaxTheBrony> you have trust me
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Vivix> closest city aint big enough to need them, I think
<Jmo4267> Go outside damn you Vivix >.>
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Vivix> ;__;
<Vivix> I've seen those small water drains, but not you know- those big ones you can get into
<PillowPoni> Jmo4267 outside? But the sun is out there
<Vivix> And only going outside at night makes you look scary
<Jmo4267> I know, but it is a risk you must take.
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<MaxTheBrony> I dont know the big ones either
<Vivix> I've seen them in movies- looks nice to have in hot weather and such, for curious kids
<PillowPoni> Jmo4267 can't we jusy open a window and let it count?
<Jmo4267> Alright you can.

<Jmo4267> Hey Saturn!
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Hiya!
<Vivix> Hiya Saturn
<Cypresswork> I know where a huge one still is, but quite hard to get there with all the overgrowth - pipe is at least 10' in dianmeter - as a kid with my brother and both our friends, we never went to far into that pipe - might head down there to find out if I can still get back there

<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgDF2xfcbv8 CIVILIZATION!!!
<Saturn> 08,01buck was, and i say this wih absolute sincerity without a hint of hyperbole, the most wonderful, wonderful weekend of my life
<Cypresswork> Steven & Mathew's brother Mike, told us stories of a secret hideout of a murderer that resided somewhere in those storm drains, said there was a make shift door to keep the water out when it rained, and a burned up sofa in that room
<Unnr> Good to hear, Saturn!
<Cypresswork> Took several trips down there looking for it :)
<MaxTheBrony> Saturn did you take any pictures :3?
<alexxm> so what happened ab BUCK Saturn
<Chrysalis> Saturn i must agree
<Vivix> Cypresswork: Hehehe- ah childhood
<MLP_Brovakiin> Saturn: I soo wish I was able to attend B.U.C.K
<Vivix> My most nostalgic memory is hanging out outside the gasstation buying cheap gum with powerrangers stickers- the smell of asphalt dust and spring
<RaveBrony> Oh hey, Saturn! Glad to see you had fun :)
<Chrysalis> Saturn throughout the entire weekend
<Chrysalis> there was only one bit which i wouldnt describe as fantastic
<Chrysalis> and that bit was embarassing
<MaxTheBrony> :P what happend?
<Cypresswork> we always got in trouble when we got back - mainly for crossing the street :P - there was an entrance right across the street, was the closest one
<Chrysalis> Saturn got 3 people from here put em on a panel
<Chrysalis> and then streamed it
<Chrysalis> while wrek drew
<MaxTheBrony> D: i missed it :s
<Jmo4267> Indeed you did MaxTheBrony.
<Vivix> I saw that, I think
<MaxTheBrony> was it today?
<Chrysalis> MaxTheBrony it was this sat/sun
<Cypresswork> :D and then the city came and put bars on several of the larger entrances
<PillowPoni> I missed that part. I was at church when it happened
<MaxTheBrony> Aw man :s
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Eh it was fun seeing you guys though. I know eggwhite and gildash well so it was quite interesting to see them
<MaxTheBrony> anyone got a video of it?
<Chrysalis> how come you guys never responded to my textws
<Chrysalis> *texts*
<Vivix> You were here on irc then?
<Jmo4267> We didn't see any texts
<Jmo4267> o.O
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: you were ufb here i think, But i'm not sure if you sen't any messages
<Vivix> I can't recall seeing any either-
<Cypresswork> the ones ending along the creek are still open, if you can get back there. I'd need a rope, its a sheer cliff on this side
<Chrysalis> i sent out texts to everyone who gave me there number for the meet on sat
<Jmo4267> Oh. Right.
<Vivix> Oh SMS
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Oh right that, But i had no way to get called and all. Plus not being able to make it to B.U.C.K
<Vivix> Cypresswork: bring a few friends and try, safely, for old times sake
<Chrysalis> theres always next year
<Chrysalis> also, i got myself the swagest piece of armour ever made

<Cypresswork> :O speaking of crazy whims - I have an old local magazine issue that mentions a few ghost stories around Cypress, I've gone to a few of the reported places, however...
<Chrysalis> oops mis paste in the middle there
<Unnr> It was given to Henry VIII by Emperor Maximilian I in 1514, its funny because the horns and specticals look like those on traditional german punishment masks... and implies that Max though Henry was a bit of an adulter.......
<MaxTheBrony> I saw Wreks name on that sheild your lucky basterd :3
<Jmo4267> Nice Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> MaxTheBrony i know :D

<MaxTheBrony> Post it :3
<Chrysalis> not without his consent
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Were there any other bronystaters there that didn't go up to the stage with you guys?
<Chrysalis> BronyInstrumental was at the event
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis allright :) sounds resonable
<Chrysalis> but didnt go into the state event
<Chrysalis> also, who is best dragon?
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: You know a interesting idea for next year is a bronystate panel where all bronystaters go up there
<MaxTheBrony> Did All the Bronystaters meet up?
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 thats what happened
<Vivix> That's cool Cypresswork , almost noone ever finds those things though- but imagine finding it, even if it's not full of goold it would be awesome
<Chrysalis> but we had no warning
<sonicandmario85> i didnt because i wasnt there
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Ah well it should be more planned then. And if possible we should get a way to have more time there and just talk and all
<Chrysalis> MaxTheBrony i was the one trying to organise said meet up, but there was a massive communications breakdown
<Cypresswork> Another good story is about the dissapearance of the mink population in the Black Horse area - there used to be mink while the area was farmland, but disapeared a few decades ago when the land was developed for subdivisions
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, had i known i could of actually tried to talk about something
<sonicandmario85> WE DONT CARE!
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis aw :s i would have loved to see all the Bronystaters together :s
<Chrysalis> but that stage is damn scary
<MaxTheBrony> i beleive you
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Still a possible idea to get up if saturn can do it, That way any bronystaters are welcome to attend at the stage and all
<killerpony7733> So that way we can all meet too
<Vivix> Cypresswork: hm- I don't really know any local stories, the town I lived in before was.. 3-400 years old, so there should be some. The closest city is -1020 years old or something
<Vivix> There is said to be buried viking kings under the streets near the river, and they want to dig there to check-
<Dark_Horst> ...why does it say currently offline when i try to connect to bronystate?
<RaveBrony> O.o

<Chrysalis> how little we had to talk about
<Dark_Horst> aaand there i said it and suddenly the chat bucks around
<Chrysalis> Jmo4267 who do you think it is?
<MaxTheBrony> aw i would like to have that filmed :D atleast hearing the panel
<Jmo4267> For a second I thought that was Jeno
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: I still loved how gildash talked about getting ban hammered when saturn was behind him
<Chrysalis> that was funny

<TheMonstaMuffin> Bye DoctoDoctorWho
<Vivix|Semiway> Ij ust wonder what game will use that physics engine-
<Jmo4267> Isn't that abit obvious Vivix|Semiway?
<Vivix|Semiway> It might be farcry3 but this isn't BY crytek, so I don't know
<Jmo4267> :P
<Vivix|Semiway> this module is by BEAM NG or something
<Vivix|Semiway> And I don't know who is using this-
<Jmo4267> Damn good work by whomever did it though.
<Gold_Demona> I have returned. Did I miss anything?
<Jmo4267> You missed everything.
<Invi> Gold_Demona, a lot of buffer time
<Invi> and hi
<Vivix|Semiway> Jmo4267: yeahh- Cryengine 3 is looking to be amazing on physics
<Jmo4267> Tis indeed.
<Vivix|Semiway> and with modern games- physics > more graphics
<Jmo4267> On the down-side, it'll be looking to destroy your hardawre.
<Jmo4267> hardware^
<teentro> but i meat almost the howl game one team... (a famous show about vid games...)
<Gold_Demona> Hi Invi
<teentro> that was great :D:D:D
<teentro> ((in germany))
<Vivix|Semiway> Yeah, but nVidia and ATI are trying to make GPU run Ageia PhysX etc, to make it less CPU intensive and such
<Vivix|Semiway> some day we might have phsyics cards, PPU as well as GPU
<Jmo4267> Mm, we'll have to wait and see though.
<Invi> Jmo4267, it destroys your hardware in HD and in perfectly accurate physics
<Jmo4267> :P
<Vivix|Semiway> Hehehe
<Vivix|Semiway> Ageia was a standalone physics card when it first came out, and the tech demos were crazyyy- then nVidia bought it and made it integrated into their cards
<Jmo4267> Yerp

<Gold_Demona> Oh, the wonders and horrors of modern food science. I just took out a package of tortillas that's been sitting in the fridge for a while. According to the expiration date, they expired three months ago, but they looked, smelled and felt just like normal. I made a wrap. Tasted fine.
<SaveDitzy> is the stream actually happening cause mine seems to still be loading or is it not happening
<Anotherguy> Anyone here has played MvM?
<SaveDitzy> Me!
<SaveDitzy> i use the muffin cannon
<SaveDitzy> :D
<Jmo4267> So much hype over MvM x_x
<Invi> Gold_Demona, that has nothing to with the fringe, more with the conservation chemicals
<Invi> *fridge
<Gold_Demona> I didn't say it had anything to do with the fridge, other than that's where I keep my tortillas. =P
<Anotherguy> Hype? I'm not hyped
<SaveDitzy> yo is the stream on or not XD
<Jmo4267> There is no stream SaveDitzy
<Vivix|Semiway> Gold_Demona: It's kinda creepy- but hey, food is food
<Anotherguy> Stream is a goner!
<SaveDitzy> good
<thelonepony> not on right now
*Jmo4267 glomps Vivix|Semiway
<SaveDitzy> i was wondering if my computer muffined out
<Anotherguy> We are all food
<Invi> Anotherguy, everything is food
<Invi> except non food
<Invi> that is poison
<Jmo4267> Invi is a genius. :>
<Anotherguy> Poison is food
<Cypresswork> slow day...4 hours into a 40+ hour week with 4.5 hours to go before closing time
<SaveDitzy> In the food chain i am a MUFFIN! or atleast thats what my mommy calls me her muffin Lol if you get that reference you epic
<Invi> Anotherguy, yeah but special food that is posonous, so it's called poison istead of food
<Gold_Demona> Invi: This is very true
<thelonepony> i need my serving of poisons *noms on the piosons
<thelonepony> nomnomnom
<Gold_Demona> Anotherguy: It is not food if it kills you
<Anotherguy> Oh yeah?
<SaveDitzy> your the food then
<SaveDitzy> :D
<Anotherguy> Eat a murderer
<SaveDitzy> lol
<SaveDitzy> but he murdered you
<Invi> Anotherguy, if you ate it, it can't kill you
<Invi> except piranhas
<SaveDitzy> take a bite out of his leg before he shoots you :D
<Anotherguy> Thus if I eat poison, he can't kill me.
<thelonepony> they'll eat u in seconds
<SaveDitzy> that is how you eat what kills you
<AJIsAwesome> Still no stream?
<SaveDitzy> Nope
<thelonepony> nope
<SaveDitzy> when is the stream coming?
<SaveDitzy> im new :)
<Anotherguy> December 25
<killerpony7733> Whenever a mod gets around and picks up
<Cypresswork> When it comes to food, It's eat or be eaten - I've seen enough of Attack of Killer Tomatoes to know about the latter
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, but that's assuming the murderer had any intention to kill you specifically. =P
<killerpony7733> SaveDitzy: Ah read the rules and FAQ yet then?

<GilDash> Chrysalis: Exactly! I thought he might make me say *something* but not actually *sit on stage and be part of the panel!* XD
<Serenity> I'm talking here from Scotland
<Jmo4267> Hey Serenity
<Gold_Demona> Hi Serenity
<SaveDitzy> im in wales
<Serenity> Currently in an Internet Cafe
<SaveDitzy> HI!
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i play as a Teen version of Doctor Whooves
<Cypresswork> Was there a dealer's room at BUCK? what kind of swag was there? :)
<Anotherguy> I'm in a ice cube
<GilDash> Sylandest: Sylly! Did you see me?

<Sylandest> GilDash: I did :)
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Well, as long as it was PC.
<GilDash> *PG
<Chrysalis> all the rules we could of broken
<Serenity> Fine, getting used to the constant accent

<SaveDitzy> i bought ALL THE SWAGS for BUCK i walked in just dressed in Derpy!
<SaveDitzy> all my clothes derpy
<WallDives|Busy> Serenity, everywhere has a accent. :P
<Chrysalis> we should of just talked about what we actually do
<Sylandest> GilDash: I imagine you must be quite tired, hehe, or worn out at the least
<GilDash> Sylandest: I honestly don't know what to think of that. My voice was terrible too from all the shouting at the party the night before.
<Chrysalis> rather than about how little we had to say
<Cypresswork> Paper bag wizard is best wizard!
<Serenity> WallDives|Busy: Where I live has no accent
<Serenity> I forget the name
<Serenity> Post something
<Sylandest> GilDash: don't worry, I didn't hear you, hehe. If anything, i only got a glimpse. I was terribly busy at the time
<Anotherguy> Why can't I enjoy things outside of my country? Why?
<GilDash> Sylandest: I've got a feeling it'll either be on Everfree or YouTube at some point...
<Cypresswork> I'm looking forward to BFF, If there's a dealers room, I'm hitting that first
<Serenity> Anyway
<Serenity> Tell Saturn I'm lurking around in his homeland
<Serenity> Forever searching
<Sylandest> GilDash: either way *shrugs*. I missed ya, hehe
<WallDives|Busy> Serenity, everywhere has a accent. Midwest, Mid-atlantic, London, etc.
<WallDives|Busy> the lack of a noticable accent is STILL a accent.
<SaveDitzy> is a stream happening today
<SaveDitzy> ?
<GilDash> Chrysalis: I wanted to try and turn it into a Q&A session, just so something happened, but no one has any questions. XD
<Anotherguy> A stream allways happens Sav

<Invi> GilDash, sure >.>
<Chrysalis> a question or 2 would of really helped
<Chrysalis> even down to "what do you do"
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Exactly. There was just *no* direction at all... I laughed when the brought Denegoth or whatever his name was. He's *never* heard of BronyState. XD
<Chrysalis> he just didnt want to go up
<Chrysalis> that was obvious
<Reikim> What are we talking about, hm?
<Chrysalis> The bronystate stream from BUCK this weekend
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Yeah, because he had as much idea as we did about what was going on.

<GilDash> I swear, I am going to kill the Scottish guy who shouted my name out. XD
<Chrysalis> was interesting to see what its like on that stage
<Chrysalis> i have a HUGE amount more respect for all the Q+A panels now
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Oh, I knew what it was going to be like up there. That's exactly why I was anxious about being in the room at the time. XD
<DaringDerpy> the internet forgets nothing :)

<SleepyPanda> Aww :(
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm OK, so my man, Y2J defeated Dolph Ziggler
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma but given the previous holder has the rematch clause we have to put up with a feud with santio for the us title
<WallDives> wait, we talking Summerslam?
<SleepyPanda> O_o
<WallDives> also, Santino, iirc, has no rematch clause.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm and lemme say, Ziggler was a worthy opponent. No wonder he's gonna become World champion
<Dark92Enigma> *CAUSE he will
<DaringDerpy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzClkMxdsgI some random music
<alexxm> WallDives i thought the rematch thing was for all championships
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives he lost to Cesaro three times IIRC
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma, none of which were for the title.
<Dark92Enigma> Oh

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Friendship is Magic Comic Covers
<DitzyDerpyHooves> Hey Prince
<MegaMoonShine> Uhh...
<Jmo4267> DitzyDerpyHooves, he's just supporting the rules.
<MegaMoonShine> We had that link already?
<Jmo4267> ikr MegaMoonShine
<DitzyDerpyHooves> the rules dont say no RP
<Barbetos|AtWork> eqd is derping it up today
<MegaMoonShine> Deja Vu! :O
<alexxm> didn't that link turn up a hour ago
<killerpony7733> DitzyDerpyHooves: Oh and you totally know theres a rule here that says no excessive RP and seriously, A brony? stop assuming something you don't know about me
<MegaMoonShine> The matrix is glitching up!
<Jmo4267> DitzyDerpyHooves, the rules say no excessive RP in this channel, you need to keep that to other channels such as Dashiesauce or such.
<DitzyDerpyHooves> I know you more than you know yous
<DitzyDerpyHooves> Dashiescauce Nice LOL
<killerpony7733> DitzyDerpyHooves: And now your a ass hat
<killerpony7733> Congratz
<Dark92Enigma> DitzyDerpyHooves: you feel better now?
<DitzyDerpyHooves> I always wanted to be like you!
<DitzyDerpyHooves> freakin N00B
<Jmo4267> And it begins.
<killerpony7733> Incoming bad trolling
<Jmo4267> ^
<DitzyDerpyHooves> i dont plan on trolling
<BronyInstrumental> oh come on! i come back to an argument? srsly guise? SRSLY!? :S
<Barbetos|AtWork> Unintentional trolling is still trolling.
<DitzyDerpyHooves> Love And Tolerate somthing you havent done calling me a ass hat heh
<DitzyDerpyHooves> good one though nice insult
<killerpony7733> DitzyDerpyHooves: Yep totally not being a ass hat are you?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Love and Tolerate is just a troll thing in of it self, to troll other trolls, and if you really believe in that garbage you really are niave.
<killerpony7733> ^
<DitzyDerpyHooves> no shit
<Boltasar> I love how those discussions lack so much grammar
<Jmo4267> ikr Boltasar
<BronyInstrumental> Barbetos|AtWork: naive*
<Gold_Demona> BronyInstrumental: I know right? I turned my head away for five minutes...
<DitzyDerpyHooves> what?
<BronyInstrumental> i might as well get started on that BS drawing now, i don't think i'll be getting many more OCs
<killerpony7733> BronyInstrumental: Good luck on that
<DitzyDerpyHooves> Good Luck
<Gold_Demona> :(
<MegaMoonShine> Have fun BronyInstrumental :)
<BronyInstrumental> would it really work with only 12 OCs though? it doesn't seem like a very accurate personiffication
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Best of luck!:)
<thelonepony> still no stream?!
<MegaMoonShine> Nope, still no stream
<BronyInstrumental> ugh, my neck still hurst from the pinkie pie party at buck :$
<BronyInstrumental> hurts*
<Jmo4267> nemnemnemnem
<Barbetos|AtWork> Is there a new trilogy double feature this week?
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: I actually use, and when I do I mean it. Definitions of words AND mantras have changed over time in society. I say that mantra to all people, not just trolls, and I mean it. It isn't countertrolling to me. I WANT people to love and tolerate each other, because if we can't accept each other's differences then there is no hope for humanity.
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Sorry. Wasn't for you.:$
<Jmo4267> >.>
<DitzyDerpyHooves> dude i just read the rules again where is the RP one

<GilDash> BronyInstrumental: It was a *great* party though. :)
<killerpony7733> DitzyDerpyHooves: it includes not acting and generally being something like a MLP FIM character if you really want to be like that, Theres channels dedicated for it
<BronyInstrumental> GilDash: yeah, i spent most of it headbanging and/or raving :D
<DitzyDerpyHooves> yeh i know lemme do somthing for a sec
<GilDash> BronyInstrumental: Same here. I was right besides Emerald and Denegoth for most of it. :)

<Ramn_0530> bo bob obo bo
<Kakumy> FE PH has I think 700k or 900k
<Vivix> It's soo fuckign worth it if you're into those kind of things
<Vivix> PH is what I'll read next I think- I'm reading Heroes atm
<Jmo> Damn Vivix, soap.
<killerpony7733> Kakumy: Should be careful cause that is very very borderline NSFW
<Jmo> D;

<Jmo> FE PH has 945k~ words.
<Jmo> MY GOD.

<Dark_Horst> foe is actually better than lots of other books i've read. books thatwerent available for free
<MegaMoonShine> I never got around to reading Project Horizons
<Vivix> Pink Eyes sound cool too
<Jim> I do not have the patience nor time for reading that many words.
<Kakumy> Pink Eyes is dang short
<Vivix> Dark_Horst: Yeah, not everyone agrees wiht that, but it's the best book I've read in years- it just hits all my likes
<Kakumy> 100k words only
<Dark_Horst> Jmo: i kinda supect thats due to the fact that the author just cant decide on an ending
<CCCP> Hello everone
<Jim> hai CCCP
<Jmo> Something like that.
<Vivix> Really? Maybe I should read Pink Eyes while waiting for updates

<sonicandmario85> is that his ping sound?
<prince-dari> Wut
<Ponies47> sonicandmario85: Jah
<Sundaysmile> pinkie + cocaine....
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03They said you suck, dari >_>
<MadSurge> Because BUCK was awesome and I got Pinkier somehow~
<prince-dari> B&
<Jim> Cocainum
<Kandarihu> What IRC client are you using anyway?
<sonicandmario85> Scoot-Scootaloo:s
<CCCP> 回数です :C
<Boltasar> prince-dari: there used to be a time your ping was hearable while streaming the movie
<Ponies47> She needs her cupcake money! Don't buck it up for her! :[
<Sundaysmile> WEAPONS GRADE Cocainium
<MaxTheBrony> STop the pings
<MaxTheBrony> Please
<sonicandmario85> NU
<MaxTheBrony> i beg you
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<MadSurge> Hey CCCP! <3
<Kandarihu> sonicandmario85, please stop pinging him.
<Ponies47> The ping! IT HURTS! D:
<CCCP> MadSurge!!! :D:D *huggies* <3
<sonicandmario85> it doesnt hurt my ears
<sonicandmario85> XD
<MaxTheBrony> Well think about us :s
<sonicandmario85> turn down your sound if you hate it so much
<MadSurge> Is it me or is the volume really muffled?
<MaxTheBrony> do you like hurting your fellow bronies
<MaxTheBrony> :(
<Ponies47> sonicandmario85: We need to have it loud to here the ponies. :(
<sonicandmario85> i can here them just fine
<Kandarihu> sonicandmario85, it's hurting the ears of other people. My ears are sensitive to treble, which this ping has a lot of. Besides that, there are always going to be people using headphones.
<Boltasar> besides everybody can see when it is imminent.
<Ponies47> MadSurge: That's why you need to turn it up and then when the ping happens. EAR RAPE! D:
<Kakumy> I don't hear the ping...
<sonicandmario85> im using headphones i have the volume on them perfect
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I f I turn it up louder, my pings wil be louder...
<Kakumy> But I do hear It's bacon time!!!
<MegaMoonShine> ALL the floaty things!
<MadSurge> MaxTheBrony: metal kinda makes you more resistant to volume!
<Ponies47> I'm using Headphones D:
<Kandarihu> So MacOS can't discriminate volume levels between applications like Windows 7 can?
<MadSurge> Scoots, probably it's just me. I'm trying another pair of old headphones
<MaxTheBrony> MadSurge But not against High vollume Ponies :s
<Sundaysmile> diaper wiper....
<MadSurge> Dat visible stink
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ma's are okay, but when it comes to streaming... they're meh
<sonicandmario85> XD
<MegaMoonShine> Stealth increased to 26
<sonicandmario85> Scoot-Scootaloo:OH YEAH ITS BACON TIME!!
<Sundaysmile> Still a Novice rank
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03For some raisin, my Scoot pings don't work
<MaxTheBrony> I request a kick :3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03sonicandmario85: Now you're just playing
<Cameh> lol
<MaxTheBrony> He playing with Firee
<Buytoast> ban him
<Boltasar> maybe because there is an s after scoot or something else, what irc are you using?
<Buytoast> slam him into the fire
<MaxTheBrony> Toast Him!!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03One more peep out of you and I will kick you so hard, you're teeth will have toes
<MaxTheBrony> :3
<Ponies47> O.O
<MLP_Brovakiin> haha
<MaxTheBrony> That was exactly what i wanted to hear
<seatsea> is it normal that the stream is zoomed
<MaxTheBrony> seatsea noope streamer is just evil at the moment
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Ponies47> seatsea: It's called a EXTREME close up :P
<Kakumy> I can't decide who to like Twilight or Pinkie..
<Kandarihu> seatsea, no. This is what the streamer (who has an obnoxious ping) is doing.
<MaxTheBrony> Kakumy like both?
<MaxTheBrony> :3
*Ponies47 Likes all da ponies :3
<Kakumy> MaxTheBrony: don't know..
<SirGanjalf> "MY WIDE ANFGLE LENS IS ABOUT TO BURST"
<Boltasar> pinkie used stare, it wasnt very effective
<SirGanjalf> *angle
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Sundaysmile> so many eye closeups
<Kakumy> Pinkie all serious for the first time in this episode
<Kandarihu> Okay, calling it obnoxious is probably not the right word. RETALIATORY, that's it.
<SirGanjalf> Kakumy: Why not both *fiesta*
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Kakumy> SirGanjalf: I only want to like 1 pony
<Ponies47> CREEPY PART INCOMING!

<Kandarihu> There's also the fact that for the sake of recycling the engine from their successful Armored Core games about a single robot blowing up everything, they're characterizing the president as the last line of defense of freedom. In reality, the people itself are the last line.
<Chrysalis> dont know who it is though :P
<Saturn> 08,01for he, in fact, has *all* the swag.
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: You are epic, my friend.

<Braviary> Oh.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Just turn off your brain, let yourself loose, and go with the flow~

*Biglaw sits on Scoot-Scootaloo's head :3
<Polydunami> I'll be back later :3
<Chrysalis> Saturn it was very good
<GilDash|Gaming> Saturn: Ah, yeah, I requested they play it back from the start. :$
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, I am NOT going to turn off my brain for something like this.
<MaxTheBrony> Derpy is not Offensive at all :s
<Chrysalis> the whole run went word for word through the entire derpy scene
<Chrysalis> twice

<Soupjuice> ^-^
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Chrysalis> and people bood
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: No. She isn't. One definition of "Derp" is clumsy. If you watch the episode, she's clumsy not retarted. I know what you meant, but you didn't phrase it well.
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: we just don't know what went wroooooong~
<Chrysalis> cause they wanted derpy not AJ
<MaxTheBrony> Secret agent Saturn :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Don't like it? Complaining about it won't do anything~

<Thunder-Crescent> its the ball cracker
<SirGanjalf> Previously on 24...
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: that's I'm saying, only dumb people find Derpy offensive
<prince-dari> SSH sometimes turns itself on on my ipod
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, being silent about this will only affirm complicity in this.
<Soupjuice> 3 times this happens :D
<Major> O_O
<Chrysalis> this is Scoot-Scootaloo http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/3573902_o.gif
<prince-dari> And some guy hacked it when I was at school once

<MadSurge> Scoot-Scootaloo: keep on trucking!
<Soupjuice> Heuy Freeman is a misanthropic, cynical 10 year old
<Kandarihu> Then I have to take responsibility, because you won't.
<Dark_Horst> PillowPoni: a secure connection protocoll
<Soupjuice> he is very intelligent for his young age, and very skilled in mutliple forms of hand to hand combat
<AJIsAwesome> Can we calm down about the stream? You don't have to watch it if you don't want to.
<SirGanjalf> dat cow
<Dken2021> moo?

<GilDash|Gaming> Saturn: For some bizzare reason, I believe you. :)
<Buytoast> new car
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, if it were something personally offensive, just ignoring it would be a perfectly valid option.

<GilDash|Gaming> Saturn: I know, I know. Just stay away from my stuff. XD
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Look, I don't like this show either. This show is purely satire. The characters are based solely on stereotypes, so even though it's not the right profile to represent people it's not supposed to be offensive.
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: running around on a con for a weekend with these temperatures, i dont imagine anybody smelling like rose petals

<otakon> we're looking at pokemon hats
<Kandarihu> I guess I agree about remixes of Smile, at least as far as it being fine on it's own.
<Obsidian> hey pokemon hats

<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Scoot-Scootaloo: i agree

<otakon> RED IS ONE OF THE BASIC COLORS
<GilDash|Gaming> Eli: We had a party too. With cannons and everything! ^_^
<otakon> THEREFORE IT IS THE BASE
<otakon> HER EYES ARE BASICALLY RED
<sonicandmario85> otakon:they were pink like RDS eyes dont believe me? watch bronies react to seaosn 2 finale
<Eli> MadSurge: yeah, it was awesome. I had fun, lot's of old friends i haven't seen in a while
<Kandarihu> Then again, in my love for that song, it seems to have gone the way of all earworms.
<Obsidian> Scoot-Scootaloo: So you've seen the manga I take it
<XAX> otakon: OKAY LETS NOT GET TOO TECHNICAL
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: They were magenta in the show. People are getting into big debates about what her eyes SHOULD be.
<otakon> sonicandmario85: PINK IS A VARIATION OF RED
<MadSurge> otakon: if that makes you happy then yes, they're all kinds of red :D
<otakon> XAX: that's what I'm TRYING to do

<fluttershyFTW> oh
<MadSurge> Eli: I met people from the chat and Ponygoons, it was great talking about ponies <3
<PillowPoni> inb4 otakick again
<fluttershyFTW> ok that makes sense
<otakon> fluttershyFTW: we aren't I'm trying to explain that ALL the variations what people think Vinyl's eyes are, they are basically red
<thelonepony> stop with the color of the eyes discussion really
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I read all of them, up to Gen 4. The Issuh one was stupid >: (
<Saturn> 08,01teehee

<otakon> Saturn: yay for stolen wifi!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Saturn.
<XAX> Scoot-Scootaloo: Really? You thought the manga was meh? I thought it was awesome. The first few arcs were amazing.
<Soupjuice> if we are going to watch any more boondocks (probably not) it has to be about stinkmeaner
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did you have fun at the convention?
<MadSurge> Eli: also Saturn gave us a REAL party cannon!!!
<fluttershyFTW> red or magenta hmmm 6_9

<fluttershyFTW> I CHOOSE ORANGE
<Saturn> 08,01i think i will

<PillowPoni> Saturn do it, filly
<MaxTheBrony> just lean back when you tell her
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03My favorite series, by far, was the electric Tale
<AJIsAwesome> Isn't the manga what the original creator of Pokemon wanted Pokemon to be?
<Eli> MadSurge: real party canon?
<Obsidian> Scoot-Scootaloo: I haven't even seen the 5th as I quit about halfway though the 4th gen
<XAX> Saturn: Go up to here with a creepy smile and say "I penetrated your network"
<XAX> DOIT
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Scoot-Scootaloo: ah yes the one thats borderline eroge :S
<fluttershyFTW> DO IT
<otakon> Saturn: as long as you download 7tbs. worth of porn you're fine
<AJIsAwesome> XAX: :D
<GilDash|Gaming> Eli: 4 of them. They were brilliant. :)
<Saturn> 08,01XAX: ha! but no.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<XAX> Damn.
<MaxTheBrony> almost xax almost :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That's the one! And Gen 4 had an interesting story, miles better than Issuh
<MadSurge> Eli: *BANG* *confetti everywhere* :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: How did you feel about JDL not attending BUCK?
<PillowPoni> Saturn don't mention the downloaded car
<Saturn> 08,01i'm about to get off my train
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Scoot-Scootaloo: Issuh is gen 4

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Uh, no, Issuh is Gen 5
<Obsidian> Later Saturn
<MaxTheBrony> cya Saturn :) *
<PillowPoni> Bye Saturn
<Kandarihu> You know what? I've been thinking about wanting to recreate Chitti in the Phantasy Star Online 2 Character Creator.
<AJIsAwesome> One of my favorite Pinkie Pie remixes.
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Scoot-Scootaloo: Gen 5 is Unova
<NocturnalBlade|Read> bye Saturn
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: And i agree. I just wanted to point out that it affected the overall reception.
<GilDash|Gaming> Saturn: See ya! :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People will download a car once 3D printer technology catches up. :p
<MaxTheBrony> AJIsAwesome agreed
<Eli> night Saturn
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Unova and Issuh are the same thing, silly :D
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: I would download a car.
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> Scoot-Scootaloo: woops nvm my mind derped
<Obsidian> Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Issuh in Japan, Unova in NA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And 3D printers become cheap enough for the general public.
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<MaxTheBrony> we can only afford ponies
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03there was Kanto. Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Issuh (Unova)
<MaxTheBrony> not cars
<GilDash|Gaming> Nittany_Discord: Personally, I think JDL not turning up was the only downside to the entire thing, and it was vastly overshadowed by the quality of the con. :)
<MadSurge> ^
<fluttershyFTW> see ya
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: imo it wasnt that bad, and minus his acting and the high ground thing, imo the movie as excellent. it had a good mix of character development, politics, action, philosophy
<MaxTheBrony> JDL ?:)
<Obsidian> Bye fluttershyFTW
<MaxTheBrony> Bye fluttershyFTW :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MaxTheBrony: John De Lancie.
<fluttershyFTW> BYE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01VA of Discord.
<MaxTheBrony> Ahhh
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> yes yes I know i just forgot for a sec Scoot-Scootaloo havent heard unova called issuh since before gen 5 even started
<Kandarihu> I'm torn between him being a Mar (human male) or a Cast (robot male). The Casts can have almost humanlike faces, but the bodies are nowhere close to being human. Maybe I should just make him Mar, and just figure that magnetism = photons.
<GilDash|Gaming> MaxTheBrony: You know? "God of Chaos?" XD
<MadSurge> GilDash|Gaming: the only shameful thing is that there were no show guests, as opposed to Evertree and the CMC panel :|
<Eli> Q
<MaxTheBrony> GilDash|Gaming: xD ye ye i get it :p
<GilDash|Gaming> MadSurge: As Saturn said though, we had plenty of musicians to try and cover that gap. I imagine he'll try to push real hard for them for next year.
<Spectrum_Rush|Sad> I have 2 autographs from John de Lancie :S ya'll jelly
<MaxTheBrony> Spectrum_Rush|Sad: O.o
<GilDash|Gaming> Spectrum_Rush|Sad: Very. :|
