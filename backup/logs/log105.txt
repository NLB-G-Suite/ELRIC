<DuskShine> >Most powerful unicorn alive.
<Xaneco> aw
<DSNesmith> clearly she's suffering from wing madness
<HaysforPonies> She should have read on about the story of Icarus
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile Brain? That would be a very generous phrase, but I think of it as stale, half-aborted nerve tissue. But you know, that's just from what I can gather from my highlt advanced servers. Nothing Special. Ha. Ha. Ha.
*Radiance glomps Crimson
<FF29> IT'S IMPOSSIBRU!!!!!!!!!!!
<DuskShine> >Isn't sure she can cast a documented spell.
<HaysforPonies> [S] RARITY. RISE UP

<Radiance> It would seem that the tables have been turned right round baby right round like a record baby.
<TwilightSparkle> dork?
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> I dont get why they say that
<Scottyloo> Bitches you saw it! >.<
<Xaneco> being assertive

<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> makes no fuckin sense
<whizzbang> wait... Rainbow Dash is a drop out?
<HaysforPonies> Haha
<sotha> (they're in denial. Repressed memories and all that.)
<LammyWolf> I WAS SO ASSERTIVE<3 :)
<DSNesmith> "I was so assertive!"
<ThunderDash> i find it ironic that the jocks deny the Sonic Rainboom, when two of them were practically there when it happened
<CrimsonRisk> I'm ok with this
<Soarin> shes totaly gunna be on top next time
<HaysforPonies> lol best line
<General_Hazard> PC, they're dumb
<quill> she was too good for flight school
<DSNesmith> GREAT SPEECH FLUTTERSHY
<Riders> Cue Rainbow Shylenol
<Sage> so supportive
<Xaneco> helpful... very helpful fluttershy
<TwilightSparkle> inb4 my life is RUINED!!
<DSNesmith> "silently judging you"
<DuskShine> Fluttershy, your sincerity is not helping!
<HaysforPonies> WAY TO STRIP THE CONFIDENCE FLUTTERSHY
<sotha> Such a Photo Finish
<TrollightSparkle> Not helping fluttershy..
<shadowLurker> such motivation!
<Ham993> She already did it... when she was younger, weaker and less experienced. Wat?
<Octavia> 14I love Rainbow Shylenol!
<Lyra> (sotha, you dont have to talk ooc, were in an open chat)
<rainbow_dash> my life is ruinedddddd
<Xaneco> *agrees*
<Scottyloo> She is almost as good at speeches as Photo Finish
<Flutteryay> Is the fucking shitstorm over?
<wanderer> 0voice crack
<GLaDOS> Think les trees, more craters
<CriticKitten> PROBLEM RD?
<CrimsonRisk> thunderdash: they aren't the brightest ponies in Cloudsdale
<Meanwhile> Indeed GLaDOS i am aware that fleshy things do not react well to neurotoxin.
<Xaneco> rarrarity
<Biske> you are tearing me apart!
<Darf14> She is starting to loose it
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> lol
<Flutteryay> The shitstorm over my personal opinion?
<HaysforPonies> Rarity be God Tier
<Sumica_2> You suck at flying = banished
<Xaneco> ahhaha!
<crono_flash> No, she''ll banish you to the moooooonnnnnnnnaaaaahhhh
<Blazanax> I'D HIT THAT
<sotha> (I know Lyra. It's just a habit.)
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> if she didnt figure it out
<FF29> GOD-LIKE!
<HaysforPonies> Wings on ass
<Octavia> 14I am RARITY! RA-RA-RA-RARITY-TY-TY-TY
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> you need two hooves out to do a rainboom
<Soarin> manly wings +1
<Darf14> :o
<Xaneco> we?
<Lyra> (ahah)
<Scottyloo> Why so srs?
<General_Hazard> Rarity = Alicorn
<DSNesmith> the only bad thing about this episode is that it created butterfly pony figures....
<ThunderDash> CrimsonRisk; true. :P
<HaysforPonies> Suddenly balloon
<ThePretender> inb4 WAHAHAHAHA
<quill> yeah i do it sometimes too mate, a friend of mkine on skype called me out on it once
<Xaneco> *wild balloon apears*
<MLP_Punk> Banish one pony to the moon and you get scared for life
<FF29> the Nimbus 2000!!!
<Radiance> gentlementlemen rarity was funny
<Blazanax> IT'S TWOLIGHT SPARKLES BLOON
<FF29> oh wait.
<DSNesmith> rarity's laugh is best laugh, no arguments....
<sotha> Oh god not the butterfly pony figures.
<Shiggy> MAGIC
<Xaneco> eeenope
<ThunderDash> knowing Pinkie she could probably walk on the cloud anyways
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile okay
<TwilightSparkle> MAGIC
<quill> rarity's laugh scares me...
<DuskShine> Cartwheeling Pinkie Pie is adorable.
<Riders> Damn, I forgot to not cast it on Pinkie
<TwilightSparkle> it was easier alright
<Darf14> Magic! No other explanation is necessary
<Pinkie_Pie> How does a pony cartwheel anyway?
<Sage> what twisted pony actually tested to see if earth ponies can walk on clouds?
<CrimsonRisk> I have seen the end, and it is candy vag .jpg
<ThunderDash> WHAAHAHAA
<maxaminus> ...So we could feature the baloon, and for the storyline...
<CopperCogs> Like Pinkie
<quill> MAGIC!!! AND SCIENCE!!!
<Soarin> her laugh is that of a conqueror
<DSNesmith> Sage, probably trollestia
<CopperCogs> that's how a pony cartwheels
<Xaneco> ooooo ahhhhhhh
*sotha thinks the walk-on-clouds spell would be a tad more widespread due to its purported utility.
<Shiggy> WTF THIS ISNT COLUMBIA
<Blazanax> OOOOO
<Hipster_Brony> 8lolwut crimsonrisk
<Xaneco> ._.
<Blazanax> AAAAAHHHHHH
<quill> AND PROBABLY THE ONLY CITY IN THE SKY...

<HaysforPonies> Cloudsdale so cool. Like Olympus
<DuskShine> Doctor Whooves in the background for only a few seconds.

<Blazanax> "DAT PLOT"
<HaysforPonies> Someone is going to be hit by that jackhammer
<Soarin> wingboners all around
<Meanwhile> Wonder where that drill landed
<DSNesmith> that jackhammer he dropped hit derpy on the head
<GLaDOS> THE JACKMAMER IMPALED GRANNY SMITH
<Xaneco> gosmermorningdew
<DSNesmith> that's where the eyes come from
<quill> i love when they say that...because the accent is nso perfect
<Riders> Where the wings protrude from aint bad either
<Luna> 7I have not seen her around, have you?
<quill> *born in new york*
<maxaminus> Can pegasus and unicorns interbreed?
<General_Hazard> yay
<DuskShine> The Jackhammer is what freed Discord for season two.

<Xaneco> marshmallow... ruining things
<quill> my parents carted me off to florida...its not fair everything is so out of the way here...
<Blazanax> maxaminus: Yes. The offspring is called a Mary Sue.
<HaysforPonies> Rarity caused Irene
<Riders> Rarity just ruined weeks of peoples lives
<Xaneco> taste the rainbow!!!
<Darf14> Taste the rainbow!
<McKay> TASTE THE RAINBOW!!!

<Flutteryay> SPICY!
<TrollightSparkle> SPICY
<General_Hazard> STUPID FAT PONY
<Octavia> 14Spicy!
<HaysforPonies> PURE SKITTLEs
<DSNesmith> my personal theory (and fanfic bait I plan to write) is that a unicorn breeding with a pegasus creates a pegacorn, a weak cousin of the alicorn. They have a horn and wings, but the wings are too gimpy to fly and the horn can't perform much magic at all.
<ThePretender> quill, the same thing happened to my best friend
<Xaneco> yes they are
<Radiance> Rainbows are PEOPLE
<Lyra> where iis she running?)
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> agreed DSN
<lordpie> yes
<TrollightSparkle> If you know what I mean.
<Soarin> he wants manly wings +1
<Octavia> 14Idiot patrol...
<Xaneco> crash
<Pinkie_Pie> Rainbow Crash..
<CrimsonRisk> lol rarity
<General_Hazard> XD
<GLaDOS> So meanwhile, in your inferior perspective, how are Rarity's wings?
<TwilightSparkle> dork
<Pinkie_Pie> Crashie
<Pinkie_Pie> Yeah
<quill> thats sucks bro
<Pinkie_Pie> That will work
<Darf14> Do they just have a wing bo- *punched*
<Xaneco> ._.
<Octavia> 14Hey crashie, whatre you doing down there?
<sotha> Not the smarted basketball on court, is he?
<Xaneco> poor rainbow
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Beavis and Butthoof.
<DecapPony> Hoops Intelligence: -1
<quill> they were fauning over me so why make them go away
<ValtheJean> @DSNesmith: I might be more inclined to agree with that if it didn't outrule the chance of Dinky being Derpy's daughter :P
<Sumica_2> should all the lab jackets have holes for wings?
<DSNesmith> best scene coming up
<sotha> *Oh wow. Smarted.*
<HaysforPonies> I see lines on the coats
<Xaneco> doomed!
<Flutteryay> I wanna hug Dash
<Blazanax> Use Viagra.
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> DSN dinky is more or less adopted
<Radiance> Ponies look cute in hard hats and little white shirts :D
<Xaneco> photos...
<Soarin> machines power nature!
<DuskShine> I remember seeing a Punnett Square dealie that treated Pegasus/Unicorn/Earth Pony genes as a sort of Rock Paper Scissors thing.
<HaysforPonies> She's attracting both genders.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i always want to hug dash, flutteryay
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS, fragile and easily beaten by even standard regular wings, appearance is irrelevant in terms of performance.
<Octavia> 14Dang attention horses
<Riders> In b4 wah ha ha
<DSNesmith> WUAHAHA
<Lyra> rarity gives everyone wing boners
<ThePretender> WAHAHAHA

<Pinkie_Pie> I want to hug every single one of those ponies
<Scottyloo> WA HAHA
<Soarin> and then she took over equestia
<ThunderDash> also THIS THREAD IS FOR ATTENTION HORSE
<DuskShine> Likewise, Pinkie_Pie.
<sotha> Why don't the non-pegasi have holes for wings in their uniforms?
<HaysforPonies> Grey Granny Smith
<Hipster_Brony> 8dat pedo granny
<DuskShine> >Perverted old mare
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile.....hm......that was actually a rather accurate observation.....you win 1 point. But you lose 2 for being inferior.

<Lyra> but she never said "oops my bad"
<Lyra> that bitch.
<FF29> Celestia is a tyrant, yes.
<Sumica_2> You know if any thing I am looking forward to S2 just bacause it will give pmv makes more footage to work with.

<Lyra> nope
<FF29> Xaneco is right.
<Darken_Skye> in a very nerdy way
<Lyra> from the canon, she tried to talk her out of it, so the next step was have fun on the
<Lyra> moon sis

<FF29> Sad, because one of my first dances was with this song..
<FF29> I hate Glee
<Xaneco> ._. yeah
<TwilightSparkle> I like this song alot
<quill> no one was born to be a slave, see the past and place the blame, tell me the color of the rain, no one was born to be a master, in the land we live, we die, face the oneness, face the lie, to find the will around the faker, we will need a true rain maker...
<DuskShine> Honestly, I really don't get the whole "I used to like this, but then a bunch of obnoxious people ruined it for me."
<FF29> A LOT.
<Turtaguin> one of mine as well, ff29
<DuskShine> You'd think people would be more upset with the obnoxious people than with the thing they used to like.
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> quill
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> its to bind a web around the faker
<Xaneco> i still like the song... but i got sick of people singing it a school...
<quill> yeahh
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> lol
<quill> mind screw...
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> yeah I agree
<LammyWolf> link please??
<ValtheJean> I think about how we look at our past, specifically music. We look back on Journey and other bands with nostalgia. But then, what music will be our generation's "journey"? What will the future look back to
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> hrmm
<ValtheJean> when I see the choices available...I weep for the future...
<Xaneco> yeah...
<FF29> Our Future better not look back to that Dubstep shit :.
<LammyWolf> may i have a link please?
<quill> thus now when i leave you i am truley blind, this blindness this blessing, the hope for mankind...
<TrollightSparkle> I know..

<FF29> Scoots is okay, I kinda like her..
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> though you would think scoot and rainbow dash would rather be guy ponies
<DuskShine> She's not as cute as Apple Bloom or Sweetie Belle, and her strong qualities don't really shine through much.
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> fair nuff Shine
<Xaneco> Sweetie Belle is my favorite CMC
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> but shes funny. Good voice
<TrollightSparkle> I don't know why, Scootaloo is my favorite filly though
<FF29> i know. but that's what makes her special ;d
<Xaneco> she's so adorable...
<ValtheJean> why would being tomboyish equate to wanting to be male?
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> well Val
<ValtheJean> that's the same stereotypes Lauren wanted to remove :P
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> its pretty obvious
<quill> i like scoots too, people dont be hating on my third fav tomboy
<DuskShine> I actually want to see this song get a reprise, 'cause from what I've heard Scootaloo's VA is actually a good singer.
<ValtheJean> I like My Little Pony. Do I now want to be female?
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Don't expect a response out of me.
<FF29> Nope.avi
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Nah breh
<Luna> 7do you Val?
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> dontbecrazy.jpg
<Xaneco> depending on you as a person
<TrollightSparkle> Hmm... nag.
<TrollightSparkle> nah*
<ValtheJean> @Luna: <.< >.>
<FF29> I'm comfortable havingg a penis.
<DecapPony> hai guys
<DuskShine> ...
<DuskShine> I thought I heard some Castlevania Birds in there for a moment.
<TrollightSparkle> Hallo
<DuskShine> I think I'm going crazy.
<Xaneco> possibly
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> biggest tomboy i knew became quite girly come puberty
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> so yeh
<FF29> Were all going tired crazy
<quill> (caleb)
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> pfft
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> i had like
<TrollightSparkle> Someone link this please?
<FF29> the ponies ended over an hour ago lol...
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> 2 fucking bottles of OJ and some lemonade
<ValtheJean> I'm just saying, gender roles are really harmful to society
<DuskShine> Agreed, Val.
<Xaneco> ^
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> quite the contrary actually
<Luna> 7TrollightSparkle: PM
<FF29> Val is right
<ValtheJean> I mean, maybe I'm a bit biased considering I grew up as a choir student, so I kinda always had the gay card flashed at me
<Synros> mhh OJ
<TrollightSparkle> Hmm?
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> its one of the reasons society has lasted so long
<Luna> 7you should see a button / tab on top of the chat with my name
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> thepunchlineismachismo had a good back and forth that i enjoyed
<DuskShine> Seriously! I can hear it!
<quill> across the sea i hear you calling me, for the sake of revenge you remind me...
<FF29> I say society needs to end, but not like anarchy, I'd prefer death over anarchy..
<TrollightSparkle> I press pm but nothing happens
<DuskShine> I despise Castlevania Birds, Castlevania Birds are my darkest. Nightmare.
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> explained just why Gender roles were albeit necessary to society
<DuskShine> ... I can hear it.
<DuskShine> Why can I hear it?!
<ValtheJean> well I'll have to politely agree to disagree PC
<TrollightSparkle> Oh
<TrollightSparkle> Hurr dur
<FF29> :D
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> Yeah, nothing wrong with that
<Xaneco> ._.
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> i'll link the article if i can find it

<FF29> I need sleep...
<FF29> But I HAVE PONIES.
<Xaneco> choose wisely my son...
<Synros> and thats all u need FF29...thats all ull ever need
<FF29> I have. Ponies outweigh this. I can use the excuse "I hate mondays" and it'll work..
<quill> sorry but like food, and sleep and soda and money too
<ValtheJean> I miss soda
<ValtheJean> and beer
<ValtheJean> mostly beer
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> ... anyways I feel a bit lazy to go trudge through archives
<Synros> vodka?
<PCIsSuperiorToMAC> to find something
<Xaneco> *perfers wine to beer*
<FF29> I miss.. not much.
<TwilightSparkle> *stills waits for Recruitment form response*
<Luna> 7agrees with Xaneco
<ValtheJean> > gave up drinking a few months ago
<TrollightSparkle> My bronies.. ponies may be life, but sleep is second to none.
<Octavia> 14Ew, beer. Not much a drinker myself, but I prefer wine too.
<FF29> *prefers vodka since it's the only alcohol he's ever had, coz he's 15..*
<Xaneco> g'night
*DuskShine has only ever drank wine and white wine in the past.
<Octavia> 14I dont usally drink, but when I do. Its wine.
<Synros> lol ff29
<DuskShine> =/ Really want to try Applejack in the future.
<Xaneco> wine has a much more complex flavor...
<DuskShine> ... wine coolers and white wine*
<CrimsonRisk> I don't always drink, but right now, I'm smashed on rum.
<FF29> I'd like to have a taste of Applejcak myself..
<FF29> oh wait.
<ValtheJean> @Octavia wine is very nice. Though it's usually a bit out of my price range. At least, the kinds that are worth drinking
<FF29> lol
<FF29> :D
<Luna> 7ValtheJean: no cheap spanish wine?
<TwilightSparkle> *eats fried chicken*
<Xaneco> i've found some really cheap good wines ._.
<ValtheJean> @Luna: ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Luna> 7hahahaha
<FF29> boxed wines explode if you put them in a microwave..
<Xaneco> anypony here like mead...?
<ValtheJean> maybe it's because of my flaming ego, but it's either the best wine, or no wine at all for me :P
<Synros> here you go FF29 http://trekmovie.com/images/st09/kelloggs/AppleJacks.jpg
<CrimsonRisk> I like alcohol.
<DuskShine> Ain't that like... fermented honey or something?

<sotha> I so totally screwed up the main story line in my first playthrough of Morrowind. I killed Vivec when I was level 7 (because he's afraid of Dwemer weapons, for some reason), and then I accidentally killed Yagrum Bagarn, which meant it was impossible for me to get the wraith guard. So then I became a vampire and murdered everyone in three major cities
<Suffuri> to you
<quill1> wildfire, sonata arctica...
<Suffuri> lol
<Suffuri> I fucked it up
<TwilightSparkle> Sweet night of pony!

<Suffuri> I think i'll do anything under 10$ on steam every weekend or every other
<sotha> And when I became a high enough level to go into Red Mountain, I stole the other artifacts, and discovered an exploit that allows you to use them without becoming mortally wounded (by removing them from your inventory with good timing), and won the game. Yeah~
<Suffuri> on here for someone random
<quill1> lawllll
<Suffuri> fuck it i killed hircine
<FF29> That's mighty nice of you :D
<Suffuri> then broke the game

<Xaneco> barbra strisand...
<TrollightSparkle> Strangely, I find I'm bobbing my head.
<Xaneco> i see...
<hunty> when using rope for bondage its a bad idea to use a cotton based rope, because as you sweat,the cotton contracts the coton contract
<TwilightSparkle> Colors!!
<Sarah-Selene> 7oh yes!
<TrollightSparkle> That was.. random.
<Sarah-Selene> 7need more espresso!
<Xaneco> im going to grab some liquid...
<Xaneco> be right back...
<hunty> its also not a good idea to use climbing rope, its too thick to work with and may cause an alleric reactions
<TwilightSparkle> o.o
<TrollightSparkle> PonyCraft 2 anyone?
<hunty> the best rope to use is quarter inch hemp rope, because its easy to work with, doesnt cut off circulation as much, and is less likely to cause alergic ractionsu
<Xaneco> back
<hunty> but thats just my opinion
<TwilightSparkle> Friendship day?
<Xaneco> ponycraft is awesome
<TrollightSparkle> "TELL ME WHY I SHOULDN'T KILL YOU RIGHT NOW"

<DecapPony> by typing with a chopstick in his mouth
<quill> he has chopstickins in his mouth ...
<profx> ...?
<SirSprinkles> 6With a chopstick, apparently.
<SirSprinkles> 6That was in a bowl next to his laptop, apparently.

<profx> well, i used a paint brush

<Xaneco> A little slower and more precise with the chopsticks...
<Xaneco> I'm using just my thumb to type everything...
<Xaneco> It works very well...
<profx> thumbs
<Xaneco> Nope, just one...
<SirSprinkles> 6It's less about accuracy and more about how sensitive the keys are to being pressed, I would think.

<Dermathil> hey
<Daz> sup man
<Dermathil> missed The Return of the King Q_Q
<Daz> missed all 3 sadly. was out getting parental ownership papers sorted : /
<Dermathil> eh. Flipping hurricane cutting my electricity 10 minutes before the movie began
<AllisZero> Morning everypony
<Daz> morn'n, AllisZero
<AllisZero> So I pretty much had massive insomnia at night singing Winter Wrap-up in my head
<AllisZero> Why is that song so damn catchy
<Daz> heh
<AllisZero> Haha man this is surprising
<AllisZero> And funny too
<Daz> oh?
<AllisZero> My drawing of Lil' mac has become more popular than any other drawing I have on my DA page, even more than the WoW drawing I have from seven months ago
<AllisZero> And it's hardly been 36 hours since posted
<AllisZero> That's the power of this fandom!
<Daz> lol sounds about right
<AllisZero> Yeah, surprising though
*Dermathil is playing Metro 2033
<Daz> hey, wasn't that on your wishilst?
<Daz> wishlist *
<GGgala> Dermathil: awesome! i'm halfway through ^_^
<RobotPinkie> what up, brownies?
<AllisZero> Morning RP!
<RobotPinkie> mornin', AllisZero
<AllisZero> I'm amazed that
<AllisZero> Even ponies can't make Firday good
<Daz> RobotPinkie!
<GGgala> hey RP
<GGgala> and, Firday?
<RobotPinkie> yo Daz
<RobotPinkie> and hi GGgala
<Daz> you styled FS yet?
<AllisZero> rebeca black's song
<RobotPinkie> Not yet, no. How'd yours go, Daz?
<Daz> you mean how it's going?
<GGgala> oh. Friday. i was thinking 'the day you shop for a fir tree for Xmas'
<RobotPinkie> Yeah
<Daz> it's currently Uh, i mean, SHE'S currently drying off on a plate.
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay
<Daz> gonna brush a little more, then rubberband her hair and take her to the shower =D
<GGgala> the hair styling still a WIP then, Daz?
<RobotPinkie> anyone know if Val finished reading FO:E?
<Daz> of course
<Daz> and i dont know RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie's holding up surprisingly well, even though she's standing next to a fan.
<Daz> still looking epic with curls? :3
<Daz> and also, i've decided to go get RD and RF on wednesday =D
<Daz> and i got a toothbrush for brushieing. do you still recommend those pins thou? and curlers?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, it's not even starting to sag, even though she's standing in like a constant breeze.
<Daz> sounds like pinkie pie!
<RobotPinkie> I used pins and drinking straws, Daz
<RobotPinkie> One pin to keep the hair in place while curling the hair up, and another to keep it in place once curled tight.
<Daz> i see. i'll try dat when i need it :P
<Daz> ah okie. I have those :P also i'm thinking of trying something: sticking about 3-4mm of (inb4 sexual jokes) a cocktail stick where FS's tail comes out. this way, the hair can come out a little UP before drooping down, like he show
<Daz> p.s. it works i've tried it, just haven't done the rest of tail / hair.
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, might to that too if it works well
<Daz> yea well i may get FS finished today, i think i can actually. so pics when done ; )
<RobotPinkie> She looks okay for now, have too much reading to do for test this week to do a proper job.
<Daz> i know i've been going slowly, but i been busy >_<. ah you've been busy too? :P
<RobotPinkie> Looking forward to seeing the result

<AllisZero> Working, unsurprisingly. Setting up a laptop for one of my users, buying some more
<AllisZero> The usual boring work routine
<AllisZero> Time Crisis was always everyone's favorite at the arcade indeed
<GGgala> eeyup. at our arcade, too.
<GGgala> well, next to Jurassic Park.
<Daz> GGgala: uuummm? ladder on wheels? I got th the part where 3 dudes chase you and try to kill you, and these crushers from the ceiling take them out
<Daz> ladder on wheels?
<GGgala> Daz: ah. so i'm further than you

<Daz> AllisZero: dayum. what an intro
<RobotPinkie> and Wrek wrote a fanfic, I guess?
<Daz> RobotPinkie, nah, but he did 2 artworks for it and recommended it to me
<Wrek> daz, did ya play any yet?
<Daz> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-through-eyes-of-another-pony.html
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay. lol I still haven't read much of DCD's fic, yet
<Daz> Wrek: I haven't played any yet
<Wrek> silly filly
<Daz> D: inorite, it's just so hard for me to sit down and do it for some reason >_<
<Daz> i will though
<Wrek> hehe
<Wrek> ne way p5 gona be awesum
<RobotPinkie> Kinda hard to take the time now, most fics are just so damn long...
<Wrek> which is why i havent read fallout eq yet
<Daz> still, i'm very sad for Luna rite now ;__; i liek Luna
<Wrek> dont worry shell *spoiler*
<Wrek> >.>
<Daz> AllisZero: gameplaywise so far pretty simple, which is nice. also, no attack button, you autoattack erry 2 secs or so, you just gotta be nearby for your slash to hit. pretty cutscenes
<Daz> Wrek, do you know what happens?
<Wrek> y
<AllisZero> Looks like my kind of game
<Daz> proofreader?
<RobotPinkie> She'll attach spoilers to her car, so don't worry too much.
<Wrek> y
<Daz> AllisZero: still introductory section so i'll keep you posted :P
<Daz> Wrek: i wanna know! >_<
<AllisZero> Sure, thank yoou
<Wrek> n
<Daz> y y n
<AllisZero> Man, yeah...
<AllisZero> THis fandom has just thrown a LOT of my preconceptions out of the water in 10 seconds flat
<RobotPinkie> Put them all together, and it spells "whinny"
<GGgala> lawl
<Wrek> on the phone, keeping it simple
<GGgala> AllisZero: which ones?
<Daz> omagad camera just flew around and it's a HUGEASS world :
<Daz> :P
<AllisZero> I really never liked the idea of fanfiction; now I'm compelled to read them
<GGgala> heh. oh, that one.
<Daz> i see Wrek on the /phone/ :P Did luna really absorb everything that's on the internet? or just thes tuff saved on the phone?
<AllisZero> And I was never much of a pack animal but hanging out with my bronies feels so right
<RobotPinkie> Actually with FiM is the first time I'm reading fanfiction and kind of enjoying it...
<Daz> ikr AllisZero
<Wrek> all teh intrnt
<Daz> Wrek: BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
<GGgala> IMPOSSIBRU
<ValtheJean> well good morning, how are mah bronies today?
<Daz> all that info, all that bronyism, about other planets, LIFE, religion, science, pornography, gore/shocking stuff, 4chan and other such sites, the ideas of rape, theft and murder, NO WAI
<RobotPinkie> 90% of the internet is now pictures of Luna in socks.
<Daz> ohai ValtheJean
<AllisZero> Morning Val
<RobotPinkie> hey ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> hai Daz....and what on earth did I miss? lol
<RobotPinkie> how'd the reading of fanfic go?
<AllisZero> Poor Luna then
<ValtheJean> hello Allis, Robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> or are you now barred from saying anything, ValtheJean? :P
<ValtheJean> lol nah I finished it now
<ValtheJean> so now I have every right to say it's a large pile of shit
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Daz> AllisZero: the music is top notch
<RobotPinkie> I take it that's your verdict, then? :P
<ValtheJean> This is my non-objective (non-flaming rage response):
<Daz> luna :(
<Wrek> bwahaha
<Daz> Wrek: WHat's gonna happen with Luna? D:
<ValtheJean> It's exactly what I would expect of a fanfic. It's someone with a competent understanding of the English language. Because it isn't completely unreadable, it's mistaken for high quality. That in of itself does not excuse that it is, indeed, a low quality work of writing
<Wrek> tell me what you think of the fic as a whole
<Daz> it had two or three incorrectly used phrases too : /
<Daz> but the fic is an awesome fic
<AllisZero> brb coffee break
<RobotPinkie> Well, I'll see if I ever read it, ValtheJean, it seems way too long though...
<ValtheJean> don't bother RobotPinkie
<ValtheJean> just don't
<ValtheJean> I've taken the bullet for you, now use me as an excuse to never subject yourself to its taint :P
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<RobotPinkie> I might do that, actually, since I don't have that much time for reading anyway :P
<ValtheJean> also ohai wrek (delayed sorry, just woke up :P)
<ValtheJean> there is ALWAYS time for reading young one!
<Wrek> hi
<ValtheJean> just read quality material :P
<RobotPinkie> Besides, I've got some Dickens that needs rereading...
<RobotPinkie> and I'm a year older than you, Val...
<RobotPinkie> (quoting fluttershy)
<ValtheJean> lol
<ValtheJean> I was about to say "You have no idea how old I am"
*ValtheJean totally is now slowpoke.jpg today
<RobotPinkie> That's true, you might be older.
<ValtheJean> lol...when I get back from class I'll have my rapier wit sharpened and ready to go! :P
<RobotPinkie> In which case you're more Fluttershy than me...
<Daz> :P more fluttershy. fluttershy now an adjective :3
<ValtheJean> I am? Oh...um...if that's alright with you...
<ValtheJean> silly daz, everyone knows that nouns are adjectives :P
<RobotPinkie> Fluttershy is also an adverb
<Daz> :P
<RobotPinkie> she's like... everything... except food
<ValtheJean> I like pudding...
<RobotPinkie> I like turtles
<Daz> o u
<RobotPinkie> Time to go buy something caffeinated before my brainwaves collapse
<ValtheJean> already? it's not even night time!
<RobotPinkie> I didn't sleep that well last night. and it's like... 5pm
<AllisZero> I got coffee!
<Wrek> there
<Wrek> at home now
<RobotPinkie> I'll be back in a few
<ValtheJean> welcome back wrek and allis :P
<ValtheJean> also damn timezones robotpinkie! DAMN THEM TO HELL!
<AllisZero> Whoa 5 Pm? 11 AM here!
<Daz> AllisZero: it's pretty good so far. not 'thisisthebest' so far though, it's very good though
<ValtheJean> 9:00 am here
<AllisZero> I'll see if I can import that, Daz
<AllisZero> Along with After Century's Episode R for the PS triple
<AllisZero> I usually love games for their stories
*Pinkie_Pie slept a bit to long
<AllisZero> But having fun counts too
<AllisZero> Hai Pinkie
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi
<ValtheJean> ohai pinkie_pie
<Daz> well ok AllisZero but so far i'm ... well i'm still playing and it looks good, but i wouldn't recommend it. not yet. i need to play more to judge it first :P

<GGgala> sorry to hear that RDash :( we lost Dermathil to Irene, too

<GGgala> courses? embarrassing?
<Wrek> nothing conclusive
<Wrek> but
<ValtheJean> oh, that would be awesome
<Wrek> all those sublte hints gotta mean something
<RDash> GGgala Is Deramathil still out of power?
<GGgala> RDash: nope, he came back and explained about Irene a few hours ago
<ValtheJean> you should just drop a subtle hint like "That pic needs to be 20% cooler" and see if he picks up on it
<GGgala> RDash: he lost power juuust before showtime too
<AllisZero> He might pick up on it but be too embarrassed to display it publicly, Wrek
<Pinkie_Pie> Wrek
<RDash> Well, at least he has power now.
<Pinkie_Pie> Something disturbing has invaded the internet.
<RDash> I lost power All. Day.
<Pinkie_Pie> This wasnt here a few days ago..

<MeteorVenture> i got in here after the colgate picture but i think i know that one too
<RDash> I think somepony made one with Brony snickers or something like that
<RDash> Some other food product
<MeteorVenture> hmm.. i don't think i've seen that
<RDash> I cant find it. I think that one is just as much or even more suggestive :P

<MeteorVenture> i'm right handed (of course or else this wouldn't be surprising)
<AllisZero> were you distracted by the phone?
<MeteorVenture> well i had to listen to what they were saying and i hold the phone with my right hand usually

<AllisZero> Hi RP, you're back too :)
<Pinkie_Pie> I considered posting that image yesterday
<RobotPinkie> ohai DecapPony
<Pinkie_Pie> But I decided against it
<RobotPinkie> and hey AllisZero
<Pinkie_Pie> I feel sorry for Carrot Top
<Pinkie_Pie> Always being tortured by Derpy
<DecapPony> nice comic lol
<FreezeFrame> Decap: I could totally see Big Mac doing that to Appletini
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fGmi0BRGYI&feature=related
<FreezeFrame> Totally an older brother move.
<RobotPinkie> "And Ditzy Do, who flew north to get the southern birds, represents the spirit of..."
<Pinkie_Pie> Silent Hill 2 main theme is kinda happy/sad
<RobotPinkie> My favorite Silent Hill song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShmyBBgO06M
<FreezeFrame> I still like this meme parody image: http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkohdmCLjd1qfl6kxo5_500.png
<Pinkie_Pie> Robot
<Pinkie_Pie> That video isnt availible in my country. The USA
<Pinkie_Pie> Available*
<RobotPinkie> Does this work? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOoFpJMjqSc
<DecapPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A89zUutc24&feature=player_embedded
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qasnp026MY
<Pinkie_Pie> Thats my favorite
<RobotPinkie> Second link worked, Pinkie_Pie?
<Pinkie_Pie> I havent played any of the silent hill games.
<Pinkie_Pie> Yeah it did
<Pinkie_Pie> I started the play SH2 the other day
<Pinkie_Pie> But then I got in the hotel and couldnt find the flashlight
<Pinkie_Pie> So I stopped, and havent gotten the guts to go back in
<DecapPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8lzIUkm77w&feature=player_embedded
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay. I really recommend playing Silent Hill 1-3... I love those games.
<RobotPinkie> Silent Hill 4 is kinda skippable, it wasn't even meant to be a Silent Hill game...

<RobotPinkie> Twitchatwitch!
<Pinkie_Pie> One second
<Pinkie_Pie> Lemme find something
<Pinkie_Pie> http://ganton3.deviantart.com/art/INSTANT-DERPY-EXTRA-217760078
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah I've seen that one
<RobotPinkie> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/a0f30dfe2ec8c6ae6b8d3bc991989ada/50970%20-%20luna%20sad%20socks.png
<RobotPinkie> Poor Luna, out of work since Episode 2. :(
<AllisZero> That's mean
<AllisZero> She's crying too ;_;
<AllisZero> Although I just don't like her voice
<MeteorVenture> i laughed i cried.. i wore socks
<RobotPinkie> Well, she'll be on more in Season 2...
<AllisZero> I hope she's actually made a permanent mane 6 character.
<AllisZero> Well, mane 7 at that point
<MeteorVenture> then everyone would be hating on the devs for fighting is magic saying that they hate luna
<MeteorVenture> and fighting is magic would stop development
<AllisZero> Eh
<AllisZero> Can't make everyone happy
<AllisZero> People will complain and fight for ANYTHING
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I think Mane 6 works as it is, but I would like to see more of some other characters on the show.
<MeteorVenture> but the funny thing is.. cancelling a fighting game CAUSES the fighting
<MeteorVenture> then the irony appreciators are happy
<AllisZero> lOl
<AllisZero> Luna and Celestia would probably be overpowered characters anyway :p
<MeteorVenture> nah.. they've outgrown their fighting spirit which the younger ones still have
<MeteorVenture> i'm just throwing out ideas to make them not seem OP
<AllisZero> Well, so much that could be done for and against
<AllisZero> There's hardly any point in trying to make the point for either or
<RobotPinkie> Have they definitely said they won't have Luna?
<AllisZero> In other news, how the hell do I set up a DHCP relay agent for a network on my Fortigate router. Tune in next week for another exciting episode of systems adminman
<RobotPinkie> That sounds like an exciting episode
<MeteorVenture> i had an awesome idea for a fanfic
<MeteorVenture> not that i could write it
<MeteorVenture> of course it's a crossover.. with final fantasy unlimited
<RobotPinkie> Haven't seen that show, unfortunately.
<MeteorVenture> well i think just from that people know where i'm going with my idea lol
<MeteorVenture> if anyone who has seen it is reading this anyway
<AllisZero> I haven't, so I can't comment much on it
<MeteorVenture> alright then that brings me to my other idea..
<MeteorVenture> kingdom hearts crossover
<MeteorVenture> but that's probably been done
<AllisZero> The one idea for a fanfic I've had is about a pony who, despite being way past the age of getting a cutie mark, never actually got one. So in meeting the mane 6, shenanigans ensue.
<MeteorVenture> lol that's pretty nice actually
<AllisZero> Buuuut probably been done too.
<MeteorVenture> an idea i had for an RPG is this
<AllisZero> Moral of the story is that she'd be pretty average at everything she does, but not exceptionally good at anything
<MeteorVenture> "they said my cutie mark could be anything.. so it became everything"
<Pinkie_Pie> Hmm
<AllisZero> They told me I could be anything I wanted, so I became a god!
<Pinkie_Pie> To the #Bunker !
<MeteorVenture> lol that kid just looks perfect for that picture
<AllisZero> lol yah
<AllisZero> 1561

<Pinkie_Pie> Its just getting a bit to complicated..
<Daz> to your pic RobotPinkie
<TwilightSparkle> Sychtube is complicated some reason the comments won't show up in my room

<VampirePrincess> hey um, do u know a short url i can give to a friend who wants to connect via his phone?
<Sathi> 7will push the volume up a bit more in 10 mins
<Pinkie_Pie> Does anyone have a playlist of all 26 mlp episodes on youtube or something?
<Sathi> 7bf going to bed
<RobotPinkie> lol okay
<TwilightSparkle> comments not showing up again but if I refresh it will make somepony else the mod
<RobotPinkie> If you create an account you can have a room that's tied to you, so you don't lose leader status.
<Pinkie_Pie> Twilight
<Pinkie_Pie> A random unnamed has mod
<Pinkie_Pie> -.-
<Pinkie_Pie> Why must synchtube torture us?!
<Reaver21> It's so weird..
<Charles> honestly, I would just suggest having him take the extra time and set up a dedicated client
<Charles> assuming it is a smartphone
<Charles> if not, then jmirc would be his only option
<Charles> or a mobile friendly web app I am not aware of
<VampirePrincess> i dont have the faintest idea what it is.
<Charles> can you ask him?
<TwilightSparkle> This rediculous
<VampirePrincess> lol just did
<VampirePrincess> he's gta txt back
<Sathi> 7smart patient
<RobotPinkie> A bit TOO smart, perhaps
<Reaver21> She Crazy.
<AllisZero> Aw, broadcast offline for m
<AllisZero> me
<Sathi> 7dinkypage is up
<Sathi> 7http://dinkypage.com/bronystate
<Reaver21> Lol, I've been on Dinkypage at THE SAME TIME!!! :D
<VampirePrincess> he doesnt know what it is but its not a smartphone.
<Reaver21> Eeyup. Medical...stuff.
<Aristeo> Backkkk
<Aristeo> :D
<Aristeo> Hi people :)
<AllisZero> Fuu dinkypage isn't loading either
<Charles> Hi person!
<Aristeo> ^_^
*Aristeo pokes VampirePrincess
*VampirePrincess pokes back
<Aristeo> who == cookie?
<RobotPinkie> Open adblock plus, block everything from scripts.hashemian.com, page now loads!
<VampirePrincess> my <3
<Reaver21> It will, just VERY VERY slowly. It takes me about a minute for the chat service and Stream to pop up..
<RobotPinkie> Wouldn't load for me either before I did that...
<Aristeo> I mean
<Aristeo> On the nick list
<Reaver21> RP, you're kidding me.
<Aristeo> Odysseus?
<VampirePrincess> he's not here yet!
<RobotPinkie> Kidding? No. Page loads instantly for me now.
<Reaver21> I'm going to do that now.
<AllisZero> Good tip RP
<VampirePrincess> i need help getting him here. he's tryin to connect via his phone and its not a smart phone.
<RobotPinkie> If you want to see the countdown again you'll have to unblock it, I guess, but countdown doesn't work ATM...
<Reaver21> It works! YOU'RE MY SAVIOR, ROBOTPINKIE!!!
<Aristeo> Well there's your problem
<RobotPinkie> np, Reaver21 :D
<Charles> as long as it is not MetroPCS, it should be able to use jMIRC
<Aristeo> Can't connect to IRC on a rotary phone
<VampirePrincess> it has internet.
<Reaver21> So, out of curiosity, do you know what those scripts did, and why they made the page take *pikiepie voice* FOREVER!!!! to load?
*VampirePrincess and cookie are confused.
<Charles> does not matter, MetroPCS has their shit locked down tighter than a monestary full of virgins next to a nightclub
<RobotPinkie> I think it's just the script for the countdown timer under "time until next stream"
<VampirePrincess> lol
<AllisZero> lLOL
*Aristeo bops Charles on the head
<AllisZero> YEAH
*Charles rubs his head
<AllisZero> THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER BRAIN ALRIGHT
<VampirePrincess> lol Charles lol
<Charles> ouch
<Reaver21> Seriously? Why the hell would it do that!? :D
<RobotPinkie> and hashemian.com is down and can't load, that's why it takes forever
<Reaver21> Ahhh. I see!
<Sathi> 7for-ever!
<TwilightSparkle> Mod trouble AGAIN
<RobotPinkie> lol :P
<VampirePrincess> soooo, its a no go with him connectin on his phone?
<Charles> seriously though, Metro PCS and their line of dumbphones are impossible for the average layman to work with
<Charles> only if he is using MetroPCS
<Pinkie_Pie> Reaver
<Charles> I was able to get jMIRC running on a pre smartphone era blackberry
<Pinkie_Pie> Check PMs
<RobotPinkie> You should register on synchtube, TwilightSparkle, that way you can tie a room to yourself.
<Charles> on the Now Netowkr with Sprint
<RobotPinkie> has to be a new room, unfortunately...
<Charles> I tried getting jMIRC to work on a friends MetroPCS dumbphone...impossible
<Reaver21> I registered for Synchtube, so..
<AllisZero> man things are boring in this office without our director of project management
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I'm guessing this is like... the one time House is wrong.
<AllisZero> She was as close to Pinkie Pie as you can get without being a cartoon character
<Reaver21> Alliszero, what kind of project? :O
<AllisZero> Websites and stuff
<Sathi> 7AllisZero: you want me in?
<VampirePrincess> he's gto straight talk.
*Sathi 7is a project manager
<VampirePrincess> got*
<Aristeo> VampirePrincess: Short answer, unless he can figure something out, then no
<Charles> is that a carrier?
<AllisZero> If you're close to florida I'm sure they're hiring :D
<VampirePrincess> network
<Aristeo> Phones + IRC == tough to set up\
<Reaver21> I see. OOHHH SHE JUST CALLED HER A BEYYYEEETCH
<Reaver21> >inb4 bananas
<Aristeo> It was tough for me to set up with my phone -- I had to use some computer science wizardry
<Reaver21> I'm actually in Savannah Georgia, not really close, I think.
<RobotPinkie> Munchausen's syndrome involves bananas?
<Charles> :/ I flit between AndroIRC and Andchat. on my blackberry it was jMirc all the way, though that was less straightforward

*Charles hugs back

<Charles> like with my ex. when she learned I was dating someone new, she was rather furious, even though we had ended the relationship
<RobotPinkie> I kinda miss ValtheJean :(

<Aristeo> oh
<TwilightSparkle> Sychtube sucks soooo bad
<PizzaPony> i am so confused right now. going to go back to trying to find my save files from mardek
*Aristeo shrugs
<Aristeo> None of my business
<Aristeo> But I like meeting new people :3
<Charles> and it disheartens me to learn that Vamp's bf may consider you to be a threat to him
<Charles> or at least that is what she fears
<Aristeo> He won't after I hug him
<Pinkie_Pie> REAVER
<Aristeo> hugs > psychology

<Lukish> all the females hang out at the lifeguard tower, and all the guys watch all the bikini-clad women going down the water slides
<Pinkie_Pie> Twilight, something keeps happening that causes something to mess up
<RobotPinkie> Why disqualify the rush?
<Lukish> (their breasts fall out usually)
<Pinkie_Pie> I wanted to keep admin so that it doesnt get given to someone who wont give it back when that happens
<Spyrorocks``> lol
<Spyrorocks``> all the water safety people here are mostly kids.
<Reaver21> Well, I'ma be hiding in synchtube.
<Spyrorocks``> they are called water safety because they dont have a lifeguarding certificate.
<Lukish> oh.
<Lukish> SOUNDS LEGIT
<Spyrorocks``> they have a whistle and yell at people
<Spyrorocks``> kind of like me, but without the whistle.
<Lukish> one of these summers I'm just going to get a month pass or something and sneak a keg in there with my buddies
<RobotPinkie> Oh he mad...

<RobotPinkie> Mind if I ask what kind of mod duties mods have, Dr-Luna?
<DecapPony> while i drink vodka?
<EdwardNewgate> that's good too
<Dr-Luna> 7that's basically all you need
<ValtheJean> 2Ponies are a hell of a drug
<Dr-Luna> 7RobotPinkie: PM me please for a personal diagnosis
<DecapPony> But Dr-Luna what about my vodka deficiency?
<herospirit> House is the smoothest

<herospirit> FUUUUUUUUUU-

<herospirit> Obviously.
<DecapPony> its just that Dr-Luna wont give me any vodka for my deficiency
<herospirit> I have water
<herospirit> If I said it was vodka, would you believe me?
<DecapPony> no
<DecapPony> well im probally going to die

<RobotPinkie> It only exists in my head thus far, but one day that'll change.
<EdwardNewgate> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=1
<Silvermane> Pinkie_Pie, the amazing part is that of all the shippers I have starred in (6 at least so far) you have never appeared outside of a cameo
<Silvermane> i've been shipped with Rarity and Rainbow Dash, and I was shipped by Applejack to Rarity in a fanfic inside a fanfic
<Pinkie_Pie> Im still doomed

<MeteorVenture> i just noticed that and never heard it brought up before
<herospirit> *still watching Gic*
<herospirit> Why can't I look away!?
<EdwardNewgate> Val being a mod almost makes me want to be one, then I realize I'm so lazy it's not worth it
<TwilightSparkle> poor fluttershy
<Pinkie_Pie> Val, come to the #Bunker
<herospirit> Just saying, whoever made Gic was really good at making words out of other sound clips
<herospirit> "POOR WILL SMITH, he didn't know it was a joke!"

<ValtheJean> 2Pinkie_Pie : PM
<EdwardNewgate> oh, oh PM me Val PM me
<Nittany_Tiger> :/
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes Val, it was trolling
<AllisZero> dat ipv6 Val
<Pinkie_Pie> A good, well planned out joke.
<ValtheJean> 2Except that I called it out before :P
<Pinkie_Pie> We call you the "Arch Demon" for a reason
<Pinkie_Pie> We were going to torture you, but I considered it to risky
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<ValtheJean> 2:P
<EdwardNewgate> You're lucky we didn't tie you down and make you read the fics like I wanted to
<herospirit> I SWEAR VAL I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
<herospirit> ...except the Arch Demon thing
<AllisZero> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/fic/src/130750824501.png
<Pinkie_Pie> Edward, no need to be Rash.
<EdwardNewgate> I HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THIS
<herospirit> that was my idea
<AllisZero> My face
<ValtheJean> 2so long as you keep those shenanigans in your own private chats (with no feedback into here), you will have no trouble from me
<herospirit> Zero... pic vanish.
<Pinkie_Pie> Define feedback
<ValtheJean> 2I feel special now, like !!Rainbowdash with lasagna
<Pinkie_Pie> > Rainbow Dash with lasagna
<Pinkie_Pie> What
<ValtheJean> 2...>mfw no one got that
*ValtheJean 2is a sad pony
<Pinkie_Pie> Someone write a fic! We need artwork, merchandise, creativity!
<AllisZero> Val, you'll never be as hated as my raid leader.
<EdwardNewgate> He feels like Dari when we troll him with Matt Smith
<TwilightSparkle> I feel lonely...
<Pinkie_Pie> RAINBOW DASH WITH LASAGNA
<MeteorVenture> i remember talking about lasagna a couple days ago
<ValtheJean> 2lol, I take it he was bad Alliszero?
<Ziltoid> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coZ9lyil3fs&feature=related
<MeteorVenture> actually yesterday i think
<AllisZero> Oh he's not bad, he's just a very hardheaded fellow who's not afraid of calling people idiots and offending anyone
<Pinkie_Pie> So, Val, what do you mean by "Feedback"?
<AllisZero> Except he's done that for almost five years
<MeteorVenture> from the title i was kinda expecting scatman
<Pinkie_Pie> Does that include links to the room?
<AllisZero> Swear to god, one day I was browsing Random Articles on Wikipedia and when he began to rant, I ended up at Hitler
<ValtheJean> 2Feedback? when did I say that?
<Pinkie_Pie> so long as you keep those shenanigans in your own private chats (with no feedback into here), you will have no trouble from me
<Pinkie_Pie> That
<ValtheJean> 2oh, derp
<Pinkie_Pie> "With no feedback into here
<NewDCD> holy shit Val I can't read your text on PC for shit
<AllisZero> I'm sure that has to be a sign
<AllisZero> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<ValtheJean> 2NewDCD: :(
<ValtheJean> 2Sprinkles made me pick it!
<EdwardNewgate> I wish I could use a color but not have the responsibilities of a mod. Val, wave your mod wand and make it so
<ValtheJean> 2also Pinkie_Pie, I'm just saying shenanigans like that shouldn't happen here
<ValtheJean> 2@EdwardNewgate: Sorry bro, the wand is being polished at the wand store right now :P
<AllisZero> So has anyone ever done laser hair removal on their face?
<EdwardNewgate> GAH
<EdwardNewgate> DCD make it so. Pweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese?
<Pinkie_Pie> Obviously not Val
<Ziltoid> Alliszero that sound completly useless
<MeteorVenture> what if someone did laser hair removal on their eyelashes?
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't want to remove my hair. I like my hair.
<AllisZero> Why? I'm tired of shaving twice a day if I go out at night.
<AllisZero> Action Hank was based on me. True story.
<Ziltoid> you know what taht means?
<Ziltoid> BEARD TIME
<TwilightSparkle> *wishes he was a mod*
<ValtheJean> 2@TwilightSparkle submit an application
<AllisZero> Stop it, we've ran out of colors already. Soon we'll have more mods than people!
<AllisZero> (trolololol lolol lolol)
<ValtheJean> 2ohai NightCat, I didn't see you log on
<AllisZero> Aww
<AllisZero> That Luna comic is cute
<AllisZero> At least it didn't end with SEND HER TO THE MOON
<TwilightSparkle> Valthejean I did. I sent it yesterday im dieing to be a mod.
<AllisZero> Poker face.
<Pinkie_Pie> I sent mine a few days ago. I dont really care about it to much. I can do the responsibilities just fine, but my real reason is for the colours.
<Pinkie_Pie> So I guess you could say im offering to work for some pink pixels.
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<Dashite> Pinkie_Pie, are you me?
<EdwardNewgate> Valthejean, will you stream, or just be crowd control?
<Pinkie_Pie> No Dashite, you are me.
<AllisZero> I have 58 minutes to do something meaningful with my evening
<Dashite> Oh, as long as we have that cleared up then.
<AllisZero> Suggest me something!
<Pinkie_Pie> Allis

<AllisZero> I could probably try that, DE
<Denied_Existence> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/48.png
<AllisZero> But I think the most optimistic I can get is, "You will die alone"
<Pinkie_Pie> OPTIMISM
<Dashite> OH SHI- He activated Pinkamena optimism by accident!
<Pinkie_Pie> GO
<ValtheJean> 2lol, I love dat pic denied

<AllisZero> Well, Duke Nukem 3D at least.
<Denied_Existence> Although, for some reason I can still log in...
<Denied_Existence> But I will not take advantage of this!

<FreezeFrame> Toning down the crybabiness a bit, redoing Chapter 10 (again), and redoing Chapters 13 and 18 a bit.
<AllisZero> How do you fanfic writers keep motivated to keep writing, really?
<AllisZero> Passion?
*Charles pets kitten
<AllisZero> Good talk!
<ValtheJean> 2I can't speak for fanfic writers, but I know actual writers just really love writing :P

<ValtheJean> 2what....what the hell am I watching?
<herospirit> SMMOOOOOZE
<AllisZero> A sea of Muks
<AllisZero> Wow
<AllisZero> I-it's okay, f-f-friendship is magic isn't r-related to this
<EdwardNewgate> Yfw it is in the next season
*Kitten purrs and nuzzles Charles
<Charles> :D
<Charles> So how is little miss kitten? (assuming the gender identifier is correct)
<FreezeFrame> Discord is totally the SMOOZE
<ValtheJean> 2that would be the day that I lose all hope for humanity
<ValtheJean> 2and then proceed to plunge into a mentality of homicide
<AllisZero> No, sorry
<AllisZero> I don't think the people who're working in the show now want to ruin their careers forever
<FreezeFrame> I'm just having fun.
<ValtheJean> 2 / want an army of pissed off bronies coming to disembowel them
<AllisZero> Well
<AllisZero> FUN ISN'T ALLOWED
<EdwardNewgate> RUIN? THIS WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE WORK THAT IS FIM
<AllisZero> I...
<AllisZero> Just gonna
<AllisZero> Go
<AllisZero> Over there <-
<TwilightSparkle> yeeeeah *follows zero*
<EdwardNewgate> HA, FOALS. SMOOZE WILL MAKE FIM GREATER THAN EVER IMAGINED AND WHERE WILL YOU BE THEN, EH NEIGH-SAYERS?
<FreezeFrame> Past Sins and Romancing Quest finished?
<AllisZero> Buying up the entire stock of pokeballs so I can contain it.
<ValtheJean> 2now let's hope I never have to hear about Nyx again >.,
<FreezeFrame> This must be my anniversary!
<FreezeFrame> Nope, S3 has an overarching storyline about Nyx.
<Denied_Existence> NYX!
<FreezeFrame> (Actually, my anniversary was Wednesday. The day I moved into the res halls)
<ValtheJean> 2the best decision the FiM execs made was to force anyone who worked on the show to NOT read fanfic
<FreezeFrame> Val: THat's a good idea regardless.
<TwilightSparkle> yeah otherwise we would see *shivers* Spiserses
<FreezeFrame> No, they're animators, not on crack, weed, LSD, PCP, and Four Loko all at once.
<ValtheJean> 2lol
<FreezeFrame> Although one of them animating Double Rainbow (the clean one) would be hilarious.
<ValtheJean> 2yeah, if the writers would be so easily influence by Spiderses, then FiM would not have been the epic awesomeness that it is
<Pinkie_Pie> Val
<Denied_Existence> Don't you make me read some Spiderses to you Val!
<Pinkie_Pie> What is your least favorite pony? Mine is probably.. Well IDK
<FreezeFrame> Although being asked why they don't and responding "But really, it's too hard, and I just don't like it that way" would potentially be better.
<Pinkie_Pie> I kinda like most of them
<ValtheJean> 2I love all ponies Pinkie_Pie :P
<Denied_Existence> QUICK VAL, PM
<Ziltoid> Hey does anyone know the order of the movies for next week?
<Pinkie_Pie> Even sea ponies?
<ValtheJean> 2sea ponies aren't ponies
<ValtheJean> 2they are hippocampus
<ValtheJean> 2and they are abominations
<FreezeFrame> Sea ponies are thalidomide victims, and should be pitied.
<EdwardNewgate> Come on Val, there must be ONE pony you hate
<Pinkie_Pie> I see
<EdwardNewgate> Nyx, perhaps?
<Pinkie_Pie> I suppose so
<FreezeFrame> Yes, the MLP/MLP/MLP/MLP/Transformers crossover
<ValtheJean> 2Nyx isn't real
<ValtheJean> 2fanon does not exist
<Pinkie_Pie> They dont have to be canon
<ValtheJean> 2so is not included
<herospirit> Oh yah, you hate fanfics don't you?
<herospirit> Anyone else have a least favorite? :0
<ValtheJean> 2with the fiery force of a thousand suns
<ValtheJean> 2but if I had to pick one
<ValtheJean> 2I hate Trixie
<AllisZero> Oh, so the people working on the FiM project can't read fanfics?
<ValtheJean> 2mostly because everyone keeps trying to pretend she's misunderstood
<ValtheJean> 2when she's just a bitch
<Silvermare> ^ you troll you
<Silvermare> My least favorite pony is Twist by far, with Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon right behind
<Silvermare> FreezeFrame
<Silvermare> I read that one
<Silvermare> Luna's Excellent Adventure?
<EdwardNewgate> RainbowDash is least favorite
<RDash> ValtheJean I hated Trixie in the show, but in the fics she's awesome :P
<ValtheJean> 2I weyalll impale you RDash O_o
<RDash> I hate Snips/Snails the most. (They count as one)
<Pinkie_Pie> So, wow. A trixie seapony would be your bane, eh Val?
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<Pinkie_Pie> Great and powerful fish.. Thing
*Pinkie_Pie tries to imagine that
<Silvermare> mfw he hates trixie
<Silvermare> Trixie is tied for #3 pony
<FreezeFrame> John Cena referencing Raritroll obliquely on Raw.
<ValtheJean> 2I could not murder it fast enough Pinkie_pie
<TwilightSparkle> my flankbook account is named Diamond Tiara -.-
<Pinkie_Pie> #3 pony?
<FreezeFrame> I hate Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon
<FreezeFrame> They're bullies.
<FreezeFrame> And bullies who don't intend to reform need to be set on fire.
<ValtheJean> 2I certainly hope they never return
<ValtheJean> 2they were useful as antagonists...nothing more
<Pinkie_Pie> Who? Seaponies?
<ValtheJean> 2no, DT and SS
<ValtheJean> 2but yeah, include sea ponies :P
<ValtheJean> 2in the list of not reappearing that is
<Pinkie_Pie> You speak as if you are not scared.

<Caramel> Who's excited for SEAPONIES in S2!!!!
<Pinkie_Pie> Nobody..
<Caramel> Awww....
<Pinkie_Pie> So.. Uhm.. Awkward?
*Pinkie_Pie nudges ValtheJean
<Pinkie_Pie> You okay?....
*Caramel is confused...
<ValtheJean> 2I am perfectly fine Pinkie_Pie
<FreezeFrame> I'm excited for 3.5 Rainbow Dash in FiM S2 :P
<Pinkie_Pie> RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
<Caramel> Is this some inside joke?
<FreezeFrame> (Which will be a mind swap episode, of Rarity's mind in Rainbow's body)

<Octavia> 14Hi Twilight
<TwilightSparkle> hiya!
<TwilightSparkle> one of the weirdest mlp fim ytps ive seen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomos5A1BFE&feature=related
<FreezeFrame> I still think this one is weirder, despite knowing its origin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik
<TwilightSparkle> that one is just random...
*Kitten is very much a little miss kitten
<mib_eiocyc> whoops
<Suffuri> there we go.
<Caramel> We streaming anything tonight?
<herospirit> So. Everyone asks for favorite Ponies...
<herospirit> But I am more specific!
<herospirit> Who is everyone's favorite fillies?
<herospirit> I prefer scootz.
<Pinkie_Pie> Applebloom I guess
<EdwardNewgate> Sweetie Bell by far
<Silvermane> Fluttershy, Luna, then 3-way-tie between Rarity, twilight, and Trixie
<Razyn> Silverspoon
<Razyn> GLASSES = WAIFU TO BE
<EdwardNewgate> Suddenly Razyn
<Razyn> Eeyup~
<ValtheJean> 2ohai razyn
<Razyn> And suddenly val is a mod
<EdwardNewgate> mfw ValtheJean has no favorite filly?
<herospirit> That's surprising. Val is the opinion master.
<herospirit> SO MUCH OPINION
<Razyn> I thought Val was the Jean?
<Suffuri> scoots
<EdwardNewgate> Val is the mod
<ValtheJean> 2and the impaler :P
<Suffuri> ValtheJean is a mod now?
<ValtheJean> 2and I dunno Edward, I love all ponies
<Razyn> >You mean implyer
<ValtheJean> 2O_o
<Suffuri> dark blue text on black background
<Suffuri> not very professional
<EdwardNewgate> You mean fanfic reader
<Razyn> I know right.
<Pinkie_Pie> Everyone has a favorite, Y U NO HAVE FAVORITE?
<ValtheJean> 2sprinkles made me pick it >.<
<Razyn> That monster!
<FreezeFrame> Rarity is my favorite :D
<ValtheJean> 15it was either that or ugly silver
*Pinkie_Pie squints
<Pinkie_Pie> What silver?
<EdwardNewgate> Silver looks better
<Razyn> Silver. Ugly
<ValtheJean> 2I thought so too, sprinkles didn't :P
*Razyn 0would pick white. Just to troll the other mods.
<Suffuri> 4Oh so I'm not one my Dari? BRING IT BITCH.
<Razyn> 0"Oh, but I have chosen a color!"
<Pinkie_Pie> Val, why do you have such a hard time picking favorites?
<ValtheJean> 2?
<Suffuri> 0harsh bro
<ValtheJean> 2My favorite pony is Caramel
<ValtheJean> 2all the others I love equally
<Razyn> 0Favorite filly. Nao.
<ValtheJean> 2except trixie
<ValtheJean> 2she can die alone
*Pinkie_Pie already knows how much you like Caramel
<Razyn> 0' ^ '
<Pinkie_Pie> And I said "Filly"
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<Suffuri> 0bleh
<Suffuri> 0Caramel sucks
<Razyn> 0cock
<Suffuri> 0brb
<ValtheJean> 2*sigh* if I had to choose, which as a disclaimer I will say does not mean I dislike the others, Sweetie Belle
<Razyn> 0Bye~
<ValtheJean> 2please no more textless spam guys
<Razyn> 0Where?
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> there we go, now I can troll 2 mods at once
<Razyn> 0Or is it filtered...?
<Razyn> VAL i USE WHITE.
<Razyn> THE RONYSATA HAS A BLACK BACKGROUND
<Pinkie_Pie> He is not lying
<ValtheJean> 2ah, my bad
<Pinkie_Pie> He did use white
<Dashite> OH MY GOD! VAL IS ALREADY LETTING THE POWER GO TO HIS HEAD!
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> Wel, dan
<ValtheJean> 2the chrome bronystate has a white background
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> that was wierd
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> Val
<Razyn> 0Highlight my posts if you wanna see what I'm saying.
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> you lie
<ValtheJean> 2you have my apologies razyn
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> im on chrome and it is black
<Dashite> Heh
<Razyn> 0It's okay val.
<ValtheJean> 2well, it's white for me
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> well what site are you on
<ValtheJean> 2appreciated razyn
<ValtheJean> 2dinkypage
<FreezeFrame> "Yes, the world really could be ending, and Pinkie Pie would still be Pinkie Pie."
<Razyn> 15How about I use grey and get auto-kicked a hundred times a night?
<Razyn> 0...Not a kick. Cool.
<FreezeFrame> I have a black background
<ValtheJean> 2well, I'm not sure why it isn't displaying your text for me razyn
<FreezeFrame> Because Razyn is forcing it white
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> 15Wait we can use grey?
<Razyn> Eeyup.
<FreezeFrame> So on your screen, it's coming in white on white
<Razyn> Cause I'm hax
<PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong> 0parently not
<FreezeFrame> I know this because I use teal for my text
<Razyn> I have a "color"
<FreezeFrame> (for display, I mean. No color codes here)
<ValtheJean> 2well, I'd prefer it if you guys didn't do that to make my life easier ;)
<Razyn> 0Well, it's easier for me so bleh.
<Razyn> Well, it's easier for me so bleh.
<ValtheJean> 2fair enough razyn
<ValtheJean> 2I'll just make sure to highlight your text
<Octavia> 14Nope, cant use grey. Its considered a color and colors are only for mods. :P
<Octavia> 14Though the one you're using is so light it looks white to me.
<Octavia> 14Almost.
<Razyn> 0In this chat: trolling a mod harder than PCIsSuperiorToMACandValIsWrong easy like a boss.
<FreezeFrame> I don't think prince-dari is running his auto-kick scripts tonight.
<Razyn> 0It was a warning for me. :\
<FreezeFrame> Ah
<Dashite> lol
<FreezeFrame> If I were op, I'd use black on hot pink
<Silvermane> Dashite, i must ask. were you serious?
<Razyn> 0Maybe he changed it? I don't break rules often, so I don't know how his script works.
<Dashite> No.
<Silvermane> Alright
<ValtheJean> 2I dunno razyn
<Octavia> 14Could just be not working atm.
<EdwardNewgate> 11Just to see if scrpit is on
<Octavia> 14Nope.jpg
<Octavia> 14Lmao
<ValtheJean> 2then maybe that gray really is an exception?
<Octavia> 14Its so light maybe its not picking up on it.
<Razyn> 0What grey?
<ValtheJean> 2we'll have to let dari know when he gets back
<Octavia> 14I'm not sure what parameters it uses.
<FreezeFrame> color 15
<Razyn> 0>Octavia's color on my bar
<Octavia> 14Its the one a bit lighter than mine.
<Razyn> 15I used it not five minutes ago.
<Razyn> 0It warns
<Octavia> 14Did it warn you for it?
<Octavia> 14Then I guess it is picking up on it.
<Octavia> 14Should be for anything for simple white.
<FreezeFrame> Octavia's is 14
<ValtheJean> 2maybe the script just derped
<Octavia> 14*except for simple white
<Razyn> 0What made you think it didn't work?
<Razyn> 0Or black
<Octavia> 14Thought you werent getting any warnings about it.
*Razyn is making a slow me post
<Razyn> 0Eeeew pink
<Octavia> 14Comes up red for me. The me posts that is.
<ValtheJean> 2it looks kinda pink to me...but I've got a white background for some reason
<ValtheJean> 2so it could be screwing with my sigbht
<ValtheJean> 2sight*
<Octavia> 14Possibly. I've got a black background. Its like a light red for me.
<Razyn> 0On black it's a gross exposed flesh pink
<TwilightSparkle> I just realized I might get a capture card for my b day!
<ValtheJean> 2very nice
<Octavia> 14Thats cool Twilight
<Jenemmy> Hey ladies.
<Jenemmy> What's going on?
<TwilightSparkle> If I do get one I would LOVE to help stream season 2 got a nice plasma screen tv behind me ^^

<Octavia> 14Lmao
<herospirit> You have no choice. As soon as you start, there is no stopping.
<Jenemmy> 0Bored as hell
<Jenemmy> 0Checking ponychan
<Jenemmy> 0Chat is not very active
<TwilightSparkle> looks like another youtuber joins the herd. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdq07a2Cvko&feature=feedf
<Denied_Existence> OH GOD
<TwilightSparkle> spy derpy and you win
<Denied_Existence> NO NOT FLUTTERSHY
<Denied_Existence> YOU BASTARDS
<RDash> FLUTTERSHY NOOO
<Denied_Existence> This makes me sad...
<Pinkie_Pie> I..
<Pinkie_Pie> I know the guy that wrote that
<ValtheJean> 2why do so many ponies cause such terrible things to fluttershy?
<Pinkie_Pie> He was talking about it the other day
<Pinkie_Pie> But I forgot who it was
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<EdwardNewgate> Pinkie_Pie is it good?
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont know about the story
<Silvermane> I read the author notes just now
<Pinkie_Pie> I remember someone talking about writing it
<Pinkie_Pie> And he said he would torture rainbow dash as well
<Silvermane> The author wrote it as his entrance into Grimdark and Sad writing, and it was mostly him enjoying the idea of a demon possessing fluttershy, possibly to explain Flutterrage
<Silvermane> and Fluttershy is also his favorite
*ValtheJean 2hates fanfics with a burning passion
*EdwardNewgate knows
<Silvermane> we know val. we know
<Curly> sorry Spyro, I totally forgot :X
*Curly had been super busy volunteering at the pride society
<Curly> and now I'm working full time ._.
<FreezeFrame> One of the tricks to making a piece of fiction affect readers, especially for sadness, is to do horrible things to a well-loved character.
<FreezeFrame> Fluttershy is certainly well-loved.
*Pinkie_Pie wishs she remembered the writer of that fanfic
<Pinkie_Pie> Uhh.. >.<
<ValtheJean> 2yes, but in the case of fanfics it's just lazy. If they want to have people cry over a character, they need to MAKE them loveable. Just copy-pasting someone who already is loveable is nothing more than cheap
<FreezeFrame> I'm not disagreeing
<FreezeFrame> I, personally, couldn't write a grimdark
<FreezeFrame> Maybe not even a sad
<DeniedExistence> Goddamn my connection some days
<FreezeFrame> I get misty-eyed at the least provocation.
<FreezeFrame> I can't imagine how badly I'd flood the area if I trid to write one.
<ValtheJean> 2lol
*ValtheJean 2hugs FreezeFrame. There there, it'll be okay
<Silvermane> my only fanfic ideas are sad stories, shipping stories, and grimdark-war stories
<Silvermane> i be a horny angry person apparently
<ValtheJean> 2mfw the entire chat is idle
<Denied_Existence> Hi
<ValtheJean> 2ohai denied
<Denied_Existence> Are you lonely?
<MirthTinker> its totally not because we've moved into other chatrooms branching off of this...or anything
<ValtheJean> 2lol
<Denied_Existence> Do you want me to write a caramel fic to cheer you up?
<Denied_Existence> Oh, guess that dude is still here...
*ValtheJean 2readies his bantrident
*ValtheJean 2is so hipster, because he uses a trident :P
<EdwardNewgate> Broseiden
<ValtheJean> 2O_o
<ValtheJean> 2omg ValtheBroseidon
<Silvermane> MirthTinker, we do not mention this
<Denied_Existence> *Pffft* Tridents...so old
*RDash uses a mallet
<MirthTinker> oh, I was talking about the shipping channel, but w/e
*Razyn 0uses a Boombox
<EdwardNewgate> mfw THERE'S A SHIPPING CHANNEL?
<MirthTinker> ...yes?
<Pinkie_Pie> Shipping channel?
<Pinkie_Pie> Wat
<ValtheJean> 2why is the chat only alive when people are trolling me? >.,
<Silvermane> Mirthtinker, we're kinda not allowed to mention that channel anymore. we get yelled at for it
<ValtheJean> 2>.<*
<EdwardNewgate> Why am I not invited?
<MirthTinker> oh, okies
<MirthTinker> nvrm, IT DOES NOT EXIST
<EdwardNewgate> NO, INVITE ME DAMMIT
<Razyn> 0OoooOoOOOoooh
<Silvermane> sir sprinkles doesn't like Bronystate being associated with anything like it
<Razyn> 0It's not reeeeeaaaal
<MirthTinker> its all in your head
<EdwardNewgate> INVITE ME

<Silvermane> it always gets slow as it gets later on
<ValtheJean> 2well plus there's no stream
<TwilightSparkle> Ill keep the chat alive!
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, I haven't been paying attention to it much of the day anyway. Playing games.
<ValtheJean> 2what games Nittany?
<Nittany_Tiger> Force Unleashed.
<Nittany_Tiger> Controls are annoying on that game.
<ValtheJean> 2haven't played it unfortunately, but I heard it was really good
<Nittany_Tiger> It's ok.
<ValtheJean> 2not the groundbreaking sensation everyone said it was, ey?
<Nittany_Tiger> I guess it differs from person to person, but I don't think it's the greatest game ever.
<ValtheJean> 2fair enough
<RDash> Cya everypony
<ValtheJean> 2see you later rdash

<Nittany_Tiger> Thank you.
<TwilightSparkle> night tiger
<Nittany_Tiger> Night Ms. Sparkle.

<TwilightSparkle> Let's see... how do you use skype?
<Silvermane> you download it
<Polarfire> heh.
<ValtheJean> 2ohai polarfire
<Polarfire> ohai Val
<Polarfire> how is modship?
<ValtheJean> 2well, as a mod I am supposed to act with dignity and grace to said question
<Denied_Existence> Goodnight Val.
<ValtheJean> 2yet I am inclined to say having a blast :P
<ValtheJean> 2g'night denied_existence
<Polarfire> lol.
<Polarfire> so are you going to stream S2?
<ValtheJean> 2It's looking like no at the moment
<FreezeFrame> "Is that even legal?" "What, lesbian Fluttershy?" "No, straight Rainbow Dash."
<Polarfire> heh.
<ValtheJean> 2Freezeframe....whut?
<Radiance> How are things in here?
<ValtheJean> 2going good radiance, how about you?
<Radiance> Good, just bored and checking IRC's briefly.
<Radiance> Ponychan isn't being very interesting right at this instant.
<ValtheJean> 2sorry to hear that
<Radiance> Meh, there's always the rest of the internet :3
<ValtheJean> 2fair enough :P
<Polarfire> ohai
<ValtheJean> 2well bronies, I think I'm going to call it a night
<FreezeFrame> Valthejean: at the end of the final chapter of Romancing Quest.
<ValtheJean> 2don't go doing things dari wouldn't like to see in the chatlog now
<Silvermane> night valthejean. and his words were as midnight
<ValtheJean> 2of....whatnow?
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari read us "Friendship is sexy" live. I doubt he will be bothered by much
<ValtheJean> 2nontheless, be good little bronies
<ValtheJean> 2and I shall see you tomorrow :P
<Silvermane> yes ma'am. night
<ValtheJean> 2O_o
<ValtheJean> 2I'm just...I'm just going to go now
<MirthTinker> night val *huggles* we love you!
<ValtheJean> 2awwww
<Razyn> 0By Val
<Silvermane> I only call men ma'am. don't worry
*ValtheJean 2hugs mirthtinker my first hug all day!
<Razyn> 0Hope you can read this, because I am typing as hard as I can.
<ValtheJean> 2much love to all of you
<Silvermane> ... I only got to hug Luna. hrmph
<ValtheJean> 2yeah I can see it Razyn :P
<ValtheJean> 2I just have to work for it ;)
<MirthTinker> shush you SilverMane...you get better goodnight stuffs :P
<ValtheJean> 2O-o
<ValtheJean> 2I'm going to pretend I DIDN'T hear that, and go to sleep untainted
<ValtheJean> 2farewell!
<FreezeFrame> ValtheJean: Romancing Quest has lesbian Fluttershy, straight Dash, and bi, poly Twilight.
<Silvermane> indeed i do
<Silvermane> really FreezeFrame? Must read... wait, POLY!?!?
<Silvermane> poly just... scares me
<FreezeFrame> polyamory
<FreezeFrame> Just with two others.
<FreezeFrame> None of that 7 wives stuff.
<Silvermane> you mean, as in multiple partners?
<FreezeFrame> It actually makes sense, Silver
<FreezeFrame> Yes.
<Razyn> 0It's a nice touch.
<FreezeFrame> at once.
<Silvermane> okay, was confusing it with pansexual
*FreezeFrame has a few poly friends
<Razyn> 0Very cute when done right.
<FreezeFrame> holy crap! 63rd rune updated!
<Silvermane> today is a good day for fanfics
<Razyn> 0I was reading that, then lost it. Then Cross and Arrow came around.
<FreezeFrame> Also, I ripped apart a homophobe's argument with religion
<Razyn> 0Profit was had.
<Silvermane> k
<FreezeFrame> He claimed homosexuality was unnatural. I told him that with all the gay sex that happens in the animal kingdom, he's saying his own God fucked up.
<Silvermane> i dislike polyamory
<Silvermane> just can't get into it
<FreezeFrame> It's not for me, but I can see the appeal.
<FreezeFrame> And hey, as long as everyone's of age and not being abused, not my concern what others do in their bedroom.
<FreezeFrame> (And no, BDSM isn't abuse, since it's consensual)
<Silvermane> pretty much FreezeFrame. (and I"m a BD person...)
<Razyn> 0Polyamory? Isn't it Polygamy?
<Silvermane> polygamy is marriage
<Silvermane> polyamory is sex
<Razyn> 0Oooh yeah...
<FreezeFrame> polyamory is actually about love, not sex
<Razyn> 0But you're still a Polygamist either way, right?
<FreezeFrame> kinda like how sexual orientation is about more than just the sex.
<Silvermane> try explaining that to people who claim bestiality is about sex
<FreezeFrame> Nope, polygamy is only if you marry them.
*Razyn 0has a head filled with fuck
<Silvermane> the term Bestiality actually means to love animals as you would a man or woman. Animalism is to have sex with animals
<Razyn> 0And Pedophilia's meaning has been corrupted as well
<Silvermane> but animalism doesn't sound that kinky, so...
<Silvermane> yeah, supposed to be love for feet. not this child rape shit
<Razyn> 0....No
<Razyn> 0Wut
<FreezeFrame> actually, that's accurate
<Silvermane> twas a joke. Pedo means foot
<FreezeFrame> the prefix ped- means foot
<Silvermane> or ped, as it were
<Razyn> 0pedo-
<Silvermane> means child and feet
<Razyn> 0WTF
<Silvermane> medical terminology, based in latin
<FreezeFrame> Actually, you're looking for pædo
<FreezeFrame> The æ (ae ligature) being dropped from English was extremely unfortunate.
<Silvermane> it was dropped because it's hard enough to teach kids to use our already convoluted language and grammar without combining letters
<Razyn> 0Paedophilia, for sake of argument?
<Razyn> 0Just, right now?
<Silvermane> we know what you mean if you say Pedophile, and if you mean feet, say foot-fetish
<Razyn> 0Fine, well.
<Razyn> 0Now I forgot where I was going.
<Silvermane> lol, another crises averted
<Silvermane> Wrek
<FreezeFrame> But yeah, my whole theory on it is, well, if all parties are of age to consent, of solid mind to consent, and do consent, who cares what kinda freaky stuff you do?
<Razyn> 0Amen, brudda
<Silvermane> pretty much. I only care if cheating is involved
<Razyn> 0...but I am quite lustful, so i may be biased.
<FreezeFrame> That's a case where one of the parties involved (the partner of the cheater) didn't consent
<FreezeFrame> And yes, they are involved, even if not directly.
<Silvermane> i personally only want one partner at a time, and i do not plan on sharing at all until we are through
<Silvermane> FreezeFrame, good way to view it.
<Razyn> 0FreezeFrame is now pretty cool in my book.
<FreezeFrame> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkohdmCLjd1qfl6kxo5_500.png
<Razyn> 0Daw
<Silvermane> lol dat Fallweather Friends
<Razyn> 0But still, thanks for spoiling the poly Twilight for me. I was looking forward to *squeeing* at that.
<Silvermane> fortunately i'll forget by the time i get around to it
<Silvermane> have you read 'Out in the Cold'?
<Razyn> 0I'm almost right there.
<Razyn> 0Yes.
<FreezeFrame> Sorry, figured you'd been working through it, and it's pretty obvious before it's made explicit.
<Razyn> 0Except for the last bonus chapter
<Silvermane> READ BONUS CHAPTER
<Razyn> 0I will!
<Silvermane> it is hilarious, sets up all sequels, and has BEST oc in the entire fandom
<Razyn> 0I know it's obvious. I just *really* hate spoilers.
<GGgala> ohay Polarfire
<Razyn> 0It's in my queue, mate! I just got the internet back at ten!
<Silvermane> sometimes the obvious is predicted early, and is stolen from us at the last moment, making it shocking
<Razyn> 0^
<GGgala> ...eeyup, website in the topic still down
<Silvermane> for instance, 'Of Mares and Magic', I predicted the end of the story (12 chapters long) in chapter 4
<FreezeFrame> anyway, I really need to sleep.
<FreezeFrame> Also, I hope Merely a Mare does finish.
<Silvermane> and the reason i predicted it, was because it was the only way the author could make it a legit story with real emotional considerations
<Razyn> 0Author: Problem, Silvermane?
<Silvermane> not at all. I LOVED that he was brave enough to do it
<Silvermane> i expected him to cop-out at the end and make it a lovey-dovey let's fuck ending, rather than teh brutal, real life sacrificial ending it was
<Silvermane> but then the epilogue...
<Silvermane> but it reinforced Twixie shipping in general. I'm out too. night everypony
*Razyn 0loved the epilogue
*Razyn 0is out
<FreezeFrame> I'm not a fan of Twixie, but I think that relationship works better as sisters.
<Razyn> 0Did you hear about Roxie?
<FreezeFrame> but sleep
<FreezeFrame> 9:30 class
<FreezeFrame> In the building furthest from my res hall
<FreezeFrame> (Though I'm not in the furthest res hall)

<prince-dari> Hey DecapPony.
<DecapPony> hi
<FreezeFrame> Best line ever: "Also, Seth, you need to watch WWE. It's like a soap opera, except the acting's mostly terrible and everyone's trying to kill each other. It's pretty much the greatest thing ever. "

<DecapMan> and spamming chat with pwnie pics
<DecapMan> is Deus EX HR worth getting?
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony
<prince-dari> Hey.
<prince-dari> Hey RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> hey prince-dari!
<RobotPinkie> How's things?
<DecapMan> hai people
<Wrek> DecapMan: ABSO-EFFING-LUTLEY
<Wrek> I'd say
<prince-dari> I'm good thanks, and yourself?
<RobotPinkie> Bit hectic, minor test tomorrow. Otherwise I'm fairly pony.
<DecapMan> i have school in 2 days :(
<DecapMan> wreck is it like open world or rail storyline?
<Wrek> 5open world
<Wrek> 5you decide when to leave for "main quest" missions
<Wrek> 5the city nexus if large and have tons of side quests and shops and shit
<Wrek> 5the multiple ways to approach the main missions are awesome
<Wrek> 5non-lethal to fucking blowing shit upo
<Wrek> 5i <3 it
<RobotPinkie> new Deus Ex or what?
<Pegacorn> EXPLOSION
<Wrek> 5RobotPinkie: aye
<RobotPinkie> ohai Pegacorn
<Wrek> 5heck you can even finish missions "ghosting"
<RobotPinkie> Really looking forward to playing the new Deus Ex, but it's gonna have to wait
<Wrek> 5which basically is complete a mission without beeing seen by anyone, not guards, not cameras
<Wrek> 5never triggering alarms and traps
<Wrek> 5etc
<Wrek> 5the difficulty is realistic
<RobotPinkie> Sounds like my kinda play style
<Wrek> 5 1 shot to the head and you die
<Wrek> 5and it works the other way around
<Wrek> 5the ai is acutally smart
<RobotPinkie> so is it as hard as the first Splinter Cell?
<Pegacorn> Implying that AI can be smart.
<Wrek> 5Pegacorn: will less dumb do?
<Wrek> 5sigh
<prince-dari> >implying AI can't be clever
<prince-dari> :P
<Wrek> 5RobotPinkie: hard and hard, you can make it hard
<Wrek> 5going ghost and non-lethal on hardest diff
<RobotPinkie> Kasparov wants a word with you, Pegacorn :P
<Wrek> 5and yes it will be very hard
<RobotPinkie> Well, ghost an non-lethal on normal, is that hard?
<Pegacorn> Kasparov?
<Wrek> 5going ghost anywhere is hard
<Wrek> 5which is the point of playing like that
<Wrek> 5did this fun thing today where i tapped a guy on the shoulder then hit him in the face knocking him oute
<Wrek> 5thats the nonolethal option
<RobotPinkie> Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion, Pegacorn
<Wrek> 5the lethal would be breakign his neck and stabbing him in the heart
<Pegacorn> Orite
<RobotPinkie> lol that does sound like fun, Wrek
<RobotPinkie> I tend to like the non-lethal option, it usually makes things harder.
<Wrek> 5using a sniåper i took this guy out
<Wrek> 5but i missjudged and he was visible by 1/10 guards
<Wrek> 5so they all pulled out their guns
<Wrek> 5sounded the alarm and started searching the whole area
<Wrek> 5i was up on a balcony taking them out 1 by 1
<RobotPinkie> Oh cool, so they don't have psychic powers and know where you are right away
<Wrek> 5untill 2 sneaked up on me and 3 saw me on the balcony
<Wrek> 5so that attempt i got HS'd back
<Wrek> 5but then i prepped with a mine in the stair
<Wrek> 5and stood at another position
<Wrek> 5though that time no one saw the dead ones
<RobotPinkie> Sounds tricky, yeah.
<DecapMan> try playing through new vegas on hard in hardcore
<Pegacorn> NEW VEGAS FTW
<RobotPinkie> Oh I will, DecapMan... as soon as they release a game of the year edition :P
<Wrek> 5DecapMan: i have beat all endings on hardcore on hardest diff without the crossair
*RobotPinkie is a cheap bastard
<Wrek> 5it was awesome
<Wrek> 5in NV
<DecapMan> i did it without vats, crosshair with a unarmed spec
<DecapMan> including all currently out DLCs
<DecapMan> cant wait for the divide DLC!
<Wrek> 5weirld wild west and light frame, with focus on survival and medicine
<Wrek> 5never use vats anyway
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah? I did it without even having the game. Naked. While doing a hand stand on the top of a flag pole.
<DecapMan> i just stealthed
<Wrek> 5pro-gamer-brohoof DecapMan
<DecapMan> i also beat saints row 2 without using weapons except in railshooter missions
<Wrek> 5never played saints
<Wrek> 5though i remember playing through doom 3 on nightmare when that was recently released
<Wrek> 5something ill never do again
<DecapMan> i would of been too freaked out to do that
<DecapMan> i was 8 when doom 3 came out
<Pegacorn> ON TOP OF A FLAG POLE
<RobotPinkie> Yup. True story.
<DecapMan> so i got a machete
<RobotPinkie> 3-heart challenge is a fun thing to do for any Zelda fans out there. I highly recommend it.
<RobotPinkie> doesn't work in all Zelda games, for obvious reasons...
<DecapMan> i just put nitrous on a bulldozer :D
<Pegacorn> ON TOP OF A FLAG POLE
<DecapMan> i got pancakes
<RobotPinkie> I got Dr Pepper.
<DecapMan> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Pegacorn> I got Dr Pepper JELLY BEANS.Beat that.
<Pegacorn> brb
<RobotPinkie> I have... uh... ponies?
<Pegacorn> Damn.
<DecapMan> i have a pony mohawk
<DecapMan> i have a blunt
<RobotPinkie> I have... tea.
<Pegacorn> I'm back
<DecapMan> i have iced tea
<RobotPinkie> I have... tons of pages to go through before tomorrow's test...
<Pegacorn> That must suck.
<RobotPinkie> It's repetition, so hopefully more of it sticks... but yeah, kinda sucks after a couple of hours.
<Pegacorn> Gonna play some GMod,seeya all later.

<DecapPony> HAI 2001 SPACE ODDESY PONY REFERENCE!
<DecapPony> HAI BRITISH ACCENTED VOICE!
<Pinkie_Pie> I have that bookmarked
<Pinkie_Pie> Because its just that awesome
<Pinkie_Pie> But then again, I bookmark everything I like
<Pinkie_Pie> Hm
<Pinkie_Pie> Let them hear this
<AllisZero> Play that episode where House makes fun of his coworkers and miraculously discovers the cure
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCzXqZMbATA&feature=related
<AllisZero> Hey man
<AllisZero> I know, I know
<AllisZero> But that house reference is funny as balls
<AllisZero> I don't really know anything about TV, I haven't watched much of it for 8-9 years
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<DecapPony> XD
<Pinkie_Pie> Its more annoying than the original
<AllisZero> Yeah, his voice is clearly not as sexy as Rarity
<DecapPony> its cause its a colt version
<Pinkie_Pie> I wouldnt say that
<DecapPony> deadpool watching the ponies is funny
<RobotPinkie> That hurt my ears so much...
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<DecapPony> can we see the latest episode of nerouticly yours?
<RobotPinkie> NNNNOOOOO
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<DecapPony> actually, isnt that bad
<Pinkie_Pie> The guy who made these actually voices all the characters
<DecapPony> ok it got kind of worse
<Pinkie_Pie> Its not perfect, but its actually pretty good
<Pinkie_Pie> Applebuck season intro is probably the best done one
<DecapPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69MpoVyj-b0
<DecapPony> PMV, just not lipsynced
<DecapPony> yeah its long, but i could of put in the one of "A Little Piece of Heaven"
<prince-dari> Hmm, A7x, nice.
<DecapPony> there arent that many A7x PMVs sadly
<prince-dari> CoB PMV
<prince-dari> Fund it.
<prince-dari> :P
<DecapPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueG7PX2PSS0
<DecapPony> this one is pretty good too
<DecapPony> "Run to the Hills" by Iron Maiden PMV
<Pinkie_Pie> Allis, Raritys voice sounds pretty sexy in this. XD
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzoAY2FyFCA&feature=related
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol, that was lip synced at the end.
<DecapPony> takes me back to GTA 4
<Pinkie_Pie> That song plays on GTA4?
<DecapPony> yeah, but it comes with the DLC i think
<AllisZero> Lol no thanks Pinky
<AllisZero> Pinkie...
<AllisZero> the fuck is wrong with my spelling today
<DecapPony> everything
*DecapPony wishes he knew about video editing software
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol, what would you make?
<Pinkie_Pie> Dat Iris wipe
<DecapPony> MOARE METAL PMVS!
<Pinkie_Pie> This is the last one I will make you guys listen to
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes, Fluttershy and applejack are off.
<Pinkie_Pie> Applejack*
<DecapPony> but isnt this by one guy?
<Pinkie_Pie> Yes
<Pinkie_Pie> Thats Rarity
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<DecapPony> still impressive
<RobotPinkie> I really don't see how this is good, but to each his own, I guess.
<Pinkie_Pie> Its good because one person sung it all by himself
<prince-dari> The male Dash voice needs to be about 20% cooler.
<Pinkie_Pie> And did a decent job on it.
<Pinkie_Pie> I know, its not perfect
<E_N> Dari is just jealous he wasn't given the role
<prince-dari> Lol no, I can't sing.
<prince-dari> You guys know that. ;P
<DecapPony> i can sing apparently kind of well
<Pinkie_Pie> Anyway, these are the manliest voices ever.
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<RobotPinkie> I could sing, once upon a time, but I'm 10 years out of practise
<AllisZero> I can sing instrumental songs only
<DecapPony> i havent sung since i was in 5th grade
<Pinkie_Pie> I havent sung ever, I dont want to
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<DecapPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUn86Yy7-IA&feature=channel_video_title
<RobotPinkie> lol AllisZero
<E_N> New EQD Post: It's Official. Tenant Had Been Voted Worst Doctor of All Time.
<prince-dari> :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh gawd. I have never bothered to watch this
<Pinkie_Pie> And now I will have to
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<E_N> GAH, I dislike these
<DecapPony> who is tenant?
<E_N> It just did
<RobotPinkie> House is best doctor
<DecapPony> i just put it on there to troll
<DecapPony> XD
<prince-dari> Tennant is best Doctor.
<RobotPinkie> Tennant is best Doctor
<DecapPony> who is tennant?
*Pinkie_Pie doesnt even know who Tenant is
<prince-dari> He acted as the Doctor once.
<E_N> >who is Tenant
<E_N> >mfw
<RobotPinkie> Note the capitalisation :P
<prince-dari> Tennant is the best doctor, Doctor.
<prince-dari> Etc.
<DecapPony> im lazy, and i failed english
<prince-dari> :P
<DecapPony> i think Dr-Luna is the best doctor
<RobotPinkie> NOWAI
<RobotPinkie> Hmmm, I can agree to that...
<E_N> Dash looks are darker shade of blue here than normal
<E_N> a
<DecapPony> this was all done by 1 guy
<DecapPony> also i love crazy pinkie pie
<Pinkie_Pie> I downloaded the whole MLP season in 720p MKV h.264
<DecapPony> and slut rarity
<Pinkie_Pie> And it still has some pixelation on the Pinkies hair and Dashs tail
<E_N> Honestly, I agree with his portrayal of dash
<RobotPinkie> everything is kinda oversaturated in this video
<E_N> Dash's hide looks the most saturated
<DecapPony> idk what saturated means
<Pinkie_Pie> The audio or video Robotpinkie?
<E_N> video
<RobotPinkie> Um, video. I'm not sure how oversaturated audio would look. :P
<RobotPinkie> Pinkamena Diane Sparkle
*Dermathil is back from an appointment, had beaten Metro 2033 just before leaving for it
<DecapPony> RUN SPIKE RUN!!!!
<RobotPinkie> ohay Dermathil
*Dermathil has beat Metro 2033 in about 10 hours
<RobotPinkie> is it worth playing?
<Dermathil> hell yes.
<RobotPinkie> It's very cheap now, so...
<Dermathil> I'm looking forward to doing another play-through to get a better ending
<Dermathil> (I had gotten it for FREE)
<Dermathil> (gifted by someone else)
<RobotPinkie> Nice
<Dermathil> Though now what I need most that I'd like to get gifted would be an external Hard Drive
<RobotPinkie> MEEP
<DecapPony> MEEP
<Dermathil> Got 15Gb left on my 450Gb Hard Drive
<Dermathil> *451
<DecapPony> odd
<E_N> THANK GOD

<E_N> 7Would you like to help us?
<prince-dari> With?
<RobotPinkie> G1 ponies?
<E_N> 7We wish to troll the one named Val of the jean
<RobotPinkie> sweet
<ValtheJean> 2oh dari...you so troll
<Pinkie_Pie> To crush his soul
<Pinkie_Pie> Val, the Arch Demon
<RobotPinkie> from Catrina?
<RobotPinkie> The hurricane?
<E_N> ohai sea ponies
<prince-dari> Depends on what you want to troll him with.
<prince-dari> :P
<Pinkie_Pie> A work of art
<Pinkie_Pie> Or, evil
<Pinkie_Pie> We have "Artists" writing something
<ValtheJean> 2"Welcome Princess Celest"
<Pinkie_Pie> That would crush his soul
<Pinkie_Pie> But, we have no way to make him read it.
<E_N> 7Would you be willing to read it while streaming?
<prince-dari> LOL SPIKE
<RobotPinkie> Spike's voice is so awesome in these...
<E_N> Can't tell if serious or trolling
<prince-dari> He'll just leave if I start reading it.
<E_N> 7You don't know that
<Pinkie_Pie> He will be curled up on the floor twitching
<Pinkie_Pie> Paralyzed with fear
<RobotPinkie> Me? I'm kidding about Spike. I'd hardly call it trolling.
<prince-dari> Yeah I do, he left when I read Friendship is Sexy for the viewers.
<prince-dari> Or some other clopfic.
<Pinkie_Pie> You read FIS...
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<E_N> 7Tell him it's a present for becoming a mod
<prince-dari> I read part 1.
<prince-dari> Never read part 2.
<prince-dari> I only read this stuff out of request.
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont think there is a part 2, is there?
<prince-dari> The fic was posted as one post, but was split up within itself.
<RobotPinkie> ohai Flutterposey
<prince-dari> It's Megan and Applejack
<prince-dari> Ok, I can't watch any more of this.

<E_N> NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER SURRENDER
<ValtheJean> 2Y so much hate for Val? :(
<Pinkie_Pie> We are also going to try to get it on EQD

<prince-dari> And remove his owner.
<E_N> 7Why would I ban you?
<prince-dari> As for deleting the channel, I'm not sure.
<E_N> 7Or delete the channel?
<ValtheJean> 2lol, isn't this video your most played/viewed dari?
<Pinkie_Pie> I have learned since last night that it is good to be paranoid

<E_N> got to go, brb in a bit
<Apokalipse> I want ponies
<mib_ln30c5> *nobs*
<prince-dari> Watch it with that, the kissing is borderline for our rules.
<ValtheJean> 2Justice League got terrible when they decided to add in 400000000 heroes
<Dark_Heart> same
<mib_ln30c5> nods**
<prince-dari> Don't post more like that please.
<RobotPinkie> What's this about GGgala?

<Pinkie_Pie> Give him ponies Prince-Dari
<mib_ln30c5> Let's watch that
<Pinkie_Pie> I made sure to pick your favorite episode Val
<RobotPinkie> No pony eps outside BMN
<Pinkie_Pie> Ok
<ValtheJean> 2I never said I hated the episode
<ValtheJean> 2I just hate Trixie
<mobileDCD> yeah
<Apokalipse> But she is GREAT and POWERFUL
<mib_ln30c5> let's watch CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS /loud
<mobileDCD> GGgala has been drafted to streaming staff position effective last night
<DecapPony> CCC
<prince-dari> Trixie does suck.
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, cool
<DecapPony> errr CMC
<mobileDCD> he'll be trained and he's already in the process of obtaining the gear for streaming S2
<prince-dari> Good.
<Apokalipse> Yay, can't wait to watch S2 here
<Pinkie_Pie> CMC works.
<prince-dari> We got any backup streamers?
<mib_ln30c5> zomg can't wait
<mobileDCD> that means you and I have to start organizing the Infrastructure, Dari
<DecapPony> theres an infrastructure here?
<mobileDCD> dari: Percy-Vee is a very promising candidate and we'll be testing his capacity soon. RDash's PC couldn't handle it. No word from Kevlar yet
<mib_ln30c5> what will the quality be like here for season 2
<mobileDCD> pretty much like the movies when streamed by me.
<mobileDCD> So pretty much the same as SD quality
<mib_ln30c5> is K
<FreezeFrame> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-argument-is-invalid.jpg
<mobileDCD> maybe a bit better and almost DVDrip
<mobileDCD> we'll see
<Pinkie_Pie> My computer could probably stream, but I dont know about my upload speed
<mib_ln30c5> nice
<FreezeFrame> I can't afford digital this year, so I can't volunteer
<Pinkie_Pie> Only 0.5mbps
<mobileDCD> Pinkie_Pie http://speedtest.net
<mib_ln30c5> my upload is enough
<Pinkie_Pie> Last time I checked
<mobileDCD> oh
<DecapPony> my upload is only 1mbps
<Apokalipse> I'd totally stream S2. Only a couple of problems. My computer is terrible, I'm too lazy, I won't have the time, I can't really be bothered.... oh yeah and I don't get the hub... apart from that I'm a great candidate
<mib_ln30c5> and i'm in australia
<Pinkie_Pie> RobotPinkie was in here wasnt he?
<mobileDCD> Decap: do you have the Hub?
<E_N> Probably?
<DecapPony> yeah
<Pinkie_Pie> RobotPinkie
<Pinkie_Pie> Your invitation has been sent.
<DecapPony> can i get an invitation?
<Apokalipse> My upload is 0.35 mbps. lol
<Pinkie_Pie> Can you be trusted, DecapPony?
<DecapPony> eeeyup
<RobotPinkie> But there's a lot going on in here, already, isn't there?
<mobileDCD> Decap: can I get info on your CPU and RAM?
<mobileDCD> additionally, do you have a capture card? If not, are you willing to spend 15 bucks?
<mobileDCD> we want to have three S2 streamers at least
<Pinkie_Pie> RobotPinkie
<Pinkie_Pie> Were you in here yesterday?
<mobileDCD> we got one plus a promising candidate
<mobileDCD> so yeah, we still have a slot open
<RobotPinkie> For a short bit
<DecapPony> capture cards are only $15?
<Pinkie_Pie> You.. Know what we are doing?
<Pinkie_Pie> Or no?
<DecapPony> i dont
<Apokalipse> Does ponychan not work for anyone else?
<mib_ln30c5> where do you get these mythical cheap capture cards
<Pinkie_Pie> You arent supposed to know yet Decap
<RobotPinkie> Wish I were in the US, then I could stream...
<DecapPony> fair enough
<MeteorVenture> ponychan doesn't seem to be loading for me either
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, no
<Dashite> It works on my end.
<Pinkie_Pie> Hm
<mobileDCD> DecapPony: not the fancy ones...but easyCap does the job very well for its price
<Apokalipse> ponychan is so strange most of the time
<DecapPony> PM it to him if ou dont want me to know
<Pinkie_Pie> We cannot allow you tell Val about anything we do in here.
<Apokalipse> By that I mean it won't work! D:<
<mobileDCD> I've witnessed first time
<mobileDCD> I dunno if you ever went to KevlarMoses's stream back in S1
<DecapPony> nope
<ValtheJean> 2hmmm....stream seems to be derping for me today
<RobotPinkie> Why? I'm confused...
<mib_ln30c5> splat
<DecapPony> but i might be able to just stream if i can get a USB to USB cable
<Apokalipse> Stream is fine for me. Too bad I'm not watching
<Pinkie_Pie> Val the Arch Demon
<RobotPinkie> are you doing Caramac shipping? :P
<E_N> Original Justice League was better
<Pinkie_Pie> A tyrant, if there ever was one
<Pinkie_Pie> Close enough, but no.
<ValtheJean> 2^
<Pinkie_Pie> Far worse, actually
<prince-dari> Poor Val.
<mobileDCD> but I taught him to use Livestream and had him get easycap
<mobileDCD> The quality was good and I watched almost-fullscreen at 1280 width-ish
<prince-dari> Everyone's always trolling him. XD
<mobileDCD> Also keep in mind this was Livestream, who has quality restrictions up the ass
<RobotPinkie> Yeah stream's fine here too, today, with the exception of getting disconnected from it once
<E_N> I LOVED the original, but didn't like unlimited
<E_N> haha
<DecapPony> oh, well is it external?
<mobileDCD> the quality was comparable to Pensivepony's ep uploads in LS
<mobileDCD> Should be a lot better here
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince, the difference is the amount of work we are doing to troll him
<Pinkie_Pie> Hours of work
<Pinkie_Pie> From several people
<Pinkie_Pie> Including 3 fic writers
<AllisZero> Man, I'd volunteer to stream, but with my schedule it's very unlinely.
<RobotPinkie> Wow...
<E_N> 5 if you count their alter egos
<mobileDCD> yeah, it's an USB dongle. You connect your TV's analog out to RCA cables, connect the cables to your easycap, and then Easycap to PC Via USB
<Aristeo> Alrightttt
<mib_ln30c5> don't these fellows see their arrows and revolvers are not enough
<Aristeo> brb
<Aristeo> gonna go to class <3
<Pinkie_Pie> We also hope to get what we make on EQD
<Aristeo> I'll be on my phone mebe
<VampirePrincess> lol
<Pinkie_Pie> We will need to get Cereal Velocity to post it
<Pinkie_Pie> As I doudt sethisto will.
<mobileDCD> it's the most affordable option
<mobileDCD> It's 8.76 without shipping on Amazon
<mobileDCD> + 1.69 for 12 ft RCA cables
<E_N> Ya dun goofed
<DecapPony> i would probally go and check the local computer store first so i wouldnt have to get my mom to buy it for me
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince, your PMs
<Pinkie_Pie> IM going to show you what I normally wouldnt
<mobileDCD> they're hard to get that way, but please do so
<Apokalipse> I should get easyCAP. Shame the only close online store selling it here wants 20€ lol
<prince-dari> Give me a minute.
<mobileDCD> dari
<prince-dari> ?
<mobileDCD> can I ask you a favor?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<RobotPinkie> Are we watching someone playing Dragon's Lair now?
<prince-dari> I have no idea what we're watching.
<DecapPony> we trolling Val with some type of shipping fic?
<E_N> It's the less good than the original justic league
<RobotPinkie> http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/1472/191770-dirk_large.gif

<prince-dari> Sorry Sathi, it's just 1 minute more.
*Luna 7did put her dancing socks on
<DecapPony> wait what am i doing?
<RobotPinkie> Well, I'm not really a writer, so...
<mobileDCD> test having him stream a bit. Quality optimization is not important at this phase. Have them keep an eye on CPU usage. Report the results back to me. If everything is peachy, he'd be drafted into streaming service
<Cat> I've not met any dragons yet
<DecapPony> what do i need?
<E_N> That's a nic ending
<Cat> mostly maeads, satyrs, centaurs, gorgons, nasty things like that
<VampirePrincess> dragons are awesomeness

<WhatPayne> Who, me? I love it now, but when I first read it, not so much...
<ValtheJean> 2dat fluttershy creeps me out
<RobotPinkie> wish I had a size reference for those ponies
*mobileDCD hasn't read Cupcakes
<mobileDCD> not because I'm scared of it
*Dr-Luna 7won't read it
<prince-dari> Cupcakes is worth it for the puns.
<mobileDCD> it's more like "I don't give a fuck"
<prince-dari> IMO
<E_N> You should, it's a psycological thriller
<mib_dhdfgz> this isn't as good as the cartoon
<prince-dari> So damn punny.
<E_N> A rollercoaster of emotions
<Apokalipse> Has anyone here read Severing?
<Pinkie_Pie> Cupcakes makes this name 20% funner
<mobileDCD> I read all of Severing
<WhatPayne> I actually have had more fun reading those "Ask Pinkamina comics".
<mobileDCD> never read reconnection though
<prince-dari> Applesmack?
<E_N> You'll go from happy, to sad, to joyful, to euphoric, to content
<mobileDCD> or the Epilogue
<prince-dari> She's a crackhead?
<Apokalipse> Did you like it?
<mobileDCD> just till Twi vs. Flutts
<Pinkie_Pie> "Reconnection" ?
<Apokalipse> I read it and reconnection
<RobotPinkie> Is this canon?
<mobileDCD> Reconnection is the unofficial sequel
<E_N> RobotPinkie Of course
<Apokalipse> It's pretty good and a tad bit less grim
<Pinkie_Pie> Rainbow Dash hurting her wings is Canon
<Pinkie_Pie> Because cardboard and duct tape
<WhatPayne> Jesus those bloated costume ponies freak me out...
<Apokalipse> I like duct tape, it lets me stick myself to myself while sticking myself to the wall
<prince-dari> SONG
<prince-dari> WUT
<RobotPinkie> Is this like that video in The Ring?
<prince-dari> That's PINKIE'S SONG
<prince-dari> WHAT THE HELL TWILIGHT
<Apokalipse> NOOOOOOO
<Sumica> ....what the hellllll
<RobotPinkie> Because I feel like I'm going to die soon.
<prince-dari> APPLEJACK NOT YOU TOO/
<E_N> Pinkie's song without Pinkie, GENIUS
<prince-dari> ET TU DASH?
<prince-dari> FAOKSDFPAKSDGOASGKPAOPGKSAKOPDFGKOPAERga
<mobileDCD> Twilight is like "Problem, Pinkie?"
<RobotPinkie> ...
<ValtheJean> 2lol, seeing dari's reaction was totally worth the loss of brain cells
<prince-dari> LOL
<Apokalipse> Screw this stream. All it ever brings is rage and pain!
<prince-dari> THEY STOLE MY SONG!
<Sumica> What abomination is this
<mobileDCD> hahhaahaa I love how people here hate it
<mobileDCD> And how people over at the other IRC hated it when people bashed it
<ValtheJean> 2lol wut?
<E_N> I like it
<E_N> It's not TERRIBLE
<E_N> just bad
<Apokalipse> It's pretty darn terrible
<E_N> Except that this is directed at kids
<RobotPinkie> what other IRC?
<ValtheJean> 2I think a guy on ponychan said it best
<Grandil> If this is not the definition of terrible I would like to see what is..
<E_N> because only kids are there
<ValtheJean> 2this was definitely meant for kids
<ValtheJean> 2and sure, it's abhorrent to us
<ValtheJean> 2but hey, it's a decent kids show
<Sumica> I guess Grats are in order for Val
<Apokalipse> meant for kids. Where have I heard that before?
<E_N> I agree with Val
<ValtheJean> 2why ty sumica
<Sumica> even though he has worst color
*ValtheJean 2cries
<Apokalipse> yeah
<ValtheJean> 2it's not my fault!
<Apokalipse> use black
<Dr-Luna> 7*soothes*
<mobileDCD> #mylittlepony at another server
<mobileDCD> They just wanted to remind people this is a kids show and hating stuff that's related to the show but more for kids is stupid, though
<RobotPinkie> Well, I don't mind this existing, I just... don't want to watch it...
<prince-dari> Well if you get mIRC Val.
<WhatPayne> mobileDCD are you the/that "DCD"?
<prince-dari> You could have a background colour on your colour.
<prince-dari> So it's readable.

<ValtheJean> 2this makes me so sad
<RobotPinkie> I AM DYINS
<WhatPayne> again? why?
<ValtheJean> 2this was the song that made me realize I was a brony :(
<Apokalipse> What did I do to deserve this?
<ValtheJean> 2and htey have murdered it
<Sumica> d..did they eat pinkie to gain her powers?
<Dr-Luna> 7Dari should totally stream this during our mane show...
<WhatPayne> We truly live in dark times...
<Apokalipse> I realised I was a brony when I watched about 10 episodes in one sitting
<E_N> I bet that was a hard part to learn
<prince-dari> Lol Dr-Luna. XD
<WhatPayne> I realized I was a Brony around ep 10.
<ValtheJean> 2dear god! Troll Sathi and Troll Dari....there is no force on earth that can stop them!
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince-Dari, have you rean On a Cross and an Arrow?
<Pinkie_Pie> Read*

<RobotPinkie> Double Trollbow all the way across the sky
<Apokalipse> I need to read the new chapters of the night that never ended
<Apokalipse> and re read the earlier ones
<E_N> So is it going to die forever?
<WhatPayne> I was sure that I am Brony when I spent entire day attempting to find blind bag ponies.
<Pinkie_Pie> Ponychan seems to work fine for me, but I have never really bothered doing anything on it..
<Apokalipse> Yes, this blows...
<Apokalipse> or bloooooooooooooows if you wish
<ValtheJean> 2lol apokalipse
<WhatPayne> And now being Brony is kinda my second nature... Which is why it hurts watching this.
<Sumica> nooo dont zoom in
<Pinkie_Pie> Is it worth doing anything on Ponychan?
<RobotPinkie> Going to use ponychan's IP instead in the future...
<Apokalipse> You know, I used to like this song and associate it with happyness
<Apokalipse> but no...
<Dr-Luna> 7you have a new association now
<Dr-Luna> 7:)
<WhatPayne> Watching the muted stream does not help at all!
<E_N> So much hate
<RobotPinkie> What? Nothing could ruin FiM for me.
<RobotPinkie> NOTHING
<ValtheJean> 2NO
<ValtheJean> 2BAD DARI
<WhatPayne> Not even if season two raped everything we love in season 1?
<Apokalipse> can we watch spider's web?
<E_N> Keep playing thid
<E_N> this
<prince-dari> Meh, I can't stream films.
<prince-dari> One of our mod rules.
<Apokalipse> aww, it was so fun...
<prince-dari> I restreamed Spider's Web once anyway
<prince-dari> Don't know if you were there. XD
<RobotPinkie> What about mini-series, dari?
<Apokalipse> Why would you do that? xD
<prince-dari> I can stream anything other than pony episodes and films pretty much
<RobotPinkie> Cool.
<prince-dari> Apokalipse: Because I wasn't there for the movie night when Spider's Web was streamed and I wanted to see it.
<Apokalipse> You know if Hipster or Ghosties were here now I bet i'd get kicked for mentioning that... film
<prince-dari> I was not disappointed, I love it.
<Dr-Luna> 7WAT!
<Apokalipse> But it was awful...
<Sumica> You know it's kinda sad when these things are more show accurate then the toy lines.
<WhatPayne> Someone should sometimes stream The IT Crowd tv series, it's awesome.
<prince-dari> I SEE DEAD CHICKENS
<Dr-Luna> 7hmm
<Dr-Luna> 7a sec
<prince-dari> Awesome film. XD
<ValtheJean> 2hah, I love the IT crowd
<RobotPinkie> The biggest disappointment here is that they didn't even include best pony
<ValtheJean> 2but Black Books is better :P
<E_N> RobotPinkie Spitfire?
<RobotPinkie> Are they going to deprive children of best pony? That's so mean.
<Apokalipse> Oh guys, how was the lord of the rings special?
<WhatPayne> I would not be surprised if there was some subtle reference to ponies in that show sometime in future...
<RobotPinkie> The songs make very little sense when people sing the wrong parts, though....
*Dr-Luna 7just found four seasons of the IT Crowd
<ValtheJean> 2Black Books is better :P
*RobotPinkie meows at Dr-Luna
<Pinkie_Pie> This guy can take all of my money
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWt_FjLuiIw&feature=related
<E_N> Singing about Rarity
<E_N> mfw
<Sumica> sounds like they changed context a bit
*Dr-Luna 7mwows back softly
<Dr-Luna> 7meows*
<WhatPayne> Black Books, haven't heard about that one. Is it any good?
<ValtheJean> 2it
<RobotPinkie> I wonder how the pinkie part will go...
<ValtheJean> 2is
<E_N> Don't know if I'd play that
<ValtheJean> 2BRILLIANT
<Pinkie_Pie> Why wouldnt you?
<WhatPayne> It has Bill Bailey? Awesome!
<Pinkie_Pie> I certainly would, I have been very bored lately
<E_N> hmmm, not the biggest fan of games like that
<E_N> I prefer real time stuff
<E_N> besides D&D, but that's an exception
<Apokalipse> come on video, end already
<E_N> yfw the rewards will never come
<prince-dari> Ohai Val.
<E_N> EVER
<ValtheJean> ohai dari
<WhatPayne> Bill Bailey was also in Spaced.

<prince-dari> You sent me a DCC request Val.
<ValtheJean> I thought that was the PM system >.<
<Sumica> we can hear you faping

<Pinkie_Pie> We have worked vigorously to keep it a secret
<ValtheJean> what is that infernal noise dari?

<RobotPinkie> how's your Fluttershy styling going, btw, Daz?
*E_N 7understands
<Pinkie_Pie> 13So, Prince
<Pinkie_Pie> 13You used MIRC to do that?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Because if you did, does that mean a nickname registered on here is registered on MIRC as well?
<WhatPayne> So, um...
<Daz> RobotPinkie, the clips are in, so i guess i got SOMETHING done last night. had to go out, and am now at someoneelse's house with their like 500KBps speed. D:
<prince-dari> The nick is registered with the network.
<prince-dari> Not the IRC client.
<prince-dari> So yeah.
<Daz> registered on mirc? bro, mirc clients just access this
<Daz> like 'if it's registered in google chrome is it also registered in firefox?'
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay
<Daz> (good comparison is good :P)
<Pinkie_Pie> 13So, I have this nickname registered
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Does that mean it will work in MIRC to?
<prince-dari> Yes.
<Apokalipse> So is everyone away or something?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13What if it is a different channel other than Bronystate?
<ValtheJean> howdy
<Daz> 'if i have a facebook account, will it work in google chrome as well?'
<WhatPayne> Everyone is waiting someone to say/do something... I guess.
<ValtheJean> well WE WANT IT AGAIN
<Apokalipse> oh come onnn
<Apokalipse> I wasn't there ever :(
<prince-dari> You register nicks with the network.
<prince-dari> Channels are irrelevant.
<RobotPinkie> I'm semi-busy, so my reactions here will be mostly kinda slow...
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Daz
<prince-dari> Anywhere on this network, the nick is registered.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Pretty soon it will
<Pinkie_Pie> 13XD
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Google wants to take over Facebook to im sure
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But what is the "Network"?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Epic chats?
<WhatPayne> I should be busy, but am kinda lazy.
<prince-dari> This network is epic-chat.
<ValtheJean> That's why you have to do it EVERY night :P
<prince-dari> irc.epic-chat.net
<Apokalipse> But I really wasn't there...
<Apokalipse> I was probably in denmark or something...
<Apokalipse> It would be interesting
<MeteorVenture> well ponychan is back for me now
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I see
<Pinkie_Pie> Meteor
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Meteor, just for relevance
<Pinkie_Pie> 13You were in here yesterday, right?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Helping us do what we do best..
<Apokalipse> Dari...
<WhatPayne> FYI am not getting sound from the show.
<ValtheJean> that is the creepiest archer I've ever seen
<Apokalipse> I hate you right now
<Pinkie_Pie> 13MeteorVenture, its me. From yesterday? We tried to stream ponies and failed so many times
<WhatPayne> Oh, better.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But I need to know if you were in here at any point yesterday
<Apokalipse> why would you do this?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Because my memory is foggy with names right now
<Dark_Heart> I think I'm going to need some mind soap
<WhatPayne> I like my MLP with humans.
<RobotPinkie> Lickety-Split is best pony
<Apokalipse> I like my MLP with a side of FiM

<ValtheJean> well I would assume foreground would be the same color I've been assigned
<ValtheJean> and mfw I have no idea what you're talking about Pinkie_pie
<prince-dari> It wouldn't set the "resize to output size" properly, even when he ticked/unticked it.

<RainBroDash> 10yeah val y u so white
<Dman> ...i'm really getting behind this colour thing =D
<RainBroDash> 10(racism trololo)
<ValtheJean> because dari is writing me a colors script (is using mIRC right now)
<Pinkie_Pie> 13So, Rainbrodash
<Luna> dari le skype
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Give me your opinion on Valthejean
<RainBroDash> 10yus?
<RainBroDash> 10.. in what sense?
<ValtheJean> so I would say background may as well be white to make it simple, with the text being that blue color sprinkles wanted me to use
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hm
<Pinkie_Pie> 13What.. Do you think of him as a mod?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13As a person?
<RainBroDash> 10mfw practically the same colours as dari? :P
<Pinkie_Pie> 13As a leader?...
<ValtheJean> well I can pick something else if you'd prefer
<Daz> ValtheJean: No offence man, but in 10 minutes i have downloaded Mirc, having never even heard of scripts or clients, and can use colours now
<RainBroDash> 10Any particular reason for the question? xD
<prince-dari> He can use colours.
<prince-dari> But he'd have to do it manually.
<ValtheJean> 2 I can use colors daz
<prince-dari> For EVERY message.
<Apokalipse> this show is so amazing
<Pinkie_Pie> 13No
<ValtheJean> 2 he's just writing me a script
<Daz> ValtheJean: orly nao
<Pinkie_Pie> 13No reason to your concern, at least.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Yet.
<ValtheJean> 2 and I was writing in white so people would stop complaining about not being able to read what I wrote
<RainBroDash> 10>no reason to my concern
<RainBroDash> 10the fuck?
<RainBroDash> 10O.o
<Apokalipse> *complains about not being able to read what you wrote*
<ValtheJean> >: (
<Grandil> The British Cockblockers!
<RainBroDash> 10I would like to know for what reason you're asking my opinion
<Dman> 2,15I can have prince-dari's colour scheme, and it took me all of 10 minutes to go from 'wtfisaclient' to, after using google, ah this is how it works ; )
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> I don't know, I don't speak English.

<RainBroDash> 10Dman.. grats?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RobotPinkie> ohay RainBroDash
<Daz> RainBroDash, i'm just saying, if ValtheJean is a /mod/ then he could do something himself rite? >_<
<Pinkie_Pie> 13His soul must shattered, crushed beneath our iron fist.
<prince-dari> Dman still can't have rainbow text.
<prince-dari> Unless he takes forever to type it.

<RainBroDash> 10XD
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Mhm..
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.>
<Grandil> This was good :)
<WhatPayne> I'd suggest either IT crowd or Spaced
<Daz> xD
<Grandil> IT Crowd would be fun. Haven't watched much of that..
<RainBroDash> 10idk both black books and blackadder are substantially more average than a lot of people make them out to be. Or at least, my opinion and stuff
*Pinkie_Pie is still waiting for Denied_Existence and Herospirit
<Apokalipse> I think I'll suggest an episode of this everytime I come here.
<ValtheJean> 2 anyone heard of Dara O'Brien?
<Daz> yah
<WhatPayne> nope
<RainBroDash> 10ye
<prince-dari> Dara O'Brien's pretty good.
<ValtheJean> 2 I think he's pretty entertaining
<Daz> He's cool, but i HATE how he always ends a joke with 'UUUUUHHHMMMM'
<prince-dari> But Frankie Boyle is best.
