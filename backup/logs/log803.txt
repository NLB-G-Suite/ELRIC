<DocSane> So retarded...
<TrixieMuffin> trivia : the horses gun is called Sarah Jane
<Barbetos> COWBOY NINJA PIRATE SPACE STATION BATALION
<Haku1013> Kandarihu It surpasses it, by far in my opinion. Granted, we could use a bit more character development and have the show speed up a little, but it's overall an amazing show
<Saturn> 08,01hye man, don't knock anthro horses
<Dark_Horst> ooooh, i remmeber that

<CK|ded> It really is.
<Sumica> 00,10so awsome to have a cartoon with you know a story
<DocSane> I sense a Xanatos Gambit.
<Kandarihu> TVTropes remembers this show well, especially for David Xanatos
<Conyst> the Xanatos Gambit
<StinkomanFan> Sumica, you sure you don't want to show The AQUABATS intro? :'(
*thelonepony|HW gives aniderp|bestcakeever some bread :3
<Cypresswolf> I dont think I ever saw how this series ended - DONTTELLME! >_<
<Saturn> 08,01also, the gargoyles are FUCKIN' SEXY
<Barbetos> The 90s. If you wanted to taken seriously you had an evil robot version of yourself
<DocSane> Wow, all at once
<sonicdude558> Sumica, I need some pony
<Ryunosuke> MIB
<CK|ded> Gargoyles was pretty much the best cartoon on the air in terms of story and such.
<MASF123|TF2> Hahah
*Saturn 08,01had so many... dreams about those
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you know what i mean xD

<CrystalPhoenix> I remember this
<Barbetos> Sumica they actually started to show this on the HUB again
<weeping_pegasi82> that walk :D
<Barbetos> Last I checked it is still shown
<CK|ded> Saturn: Well, it's impossible not to be gay for Goliath with that voice
<Barbetos> And batman beyound.
<MASF123|TF2> Love live Kids WB!
<Kandarihu> Mom's watching, and she's loving this
<Kencolt> Wasn't too long ago that MiB was running on the HUB.
<CrystalPhoenix> yep
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Smith don't look right animated.
<weeping_pegasi82> batman beyond sunds
<weeping_pegasi82> *sucks
<Haku1013> MiB was a pretty good actually
<CrystalPhoenix> in the 90s: if it exist there's a cartoon show of it
<Suzano> Intro is kinda boring

<Saturn> 08,01Blankets and Pillows, i think it's called
<Kandarihu> ...then again, I guess they weren't really macguffins, since they were used regularily
<Haku1013> Hak Fu
<CK|ded> Saturn: Keith David's voice is probably only second to Steve Blum in my mind anymore, though.
<Saturn> 08,01CK|ded: it's on Surf The Channel, go watch it

<MASF123|TF2> no I did see a bit of this as a kid.
<Barbetos> RUN!!
<weeping_pegasi82> they must have a hard time at airports
<CK|ded> ;_;
<Kandarihu> It seemed to go hand in hand with the English dub of Go Lion... or Thundercats. Not sure. Maybe it was Thundercats.
<CCharmanderK> CAPTAIN POWER
<Ryunosuke> oh
<Saturn> 08,01CK|ded: i meant WatchSeries.eu
<MASF123|TF2> Robo co-

<MASF123|TF2> MvM
<Barbetos> Matrix
<Barbetos> Ho shit

<Conyst> Did it say 2047
<CK|ded> Using terrible graphics!
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: Computer Architecture went well; i have Programming Language Design and Implementation tomorrow, which is my last one
<Barbetos> Matrix totally ripped this off.
<Kencolt> A strange attempt to make a working Videogame-TV interface.
<Ryunosuke> or terminator
<SirGanjalf> Lord Dredd? LAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
<weeping_pegasi82> that bad cgi >_<
<CCharmanderK> The only kids' show where someone actually told someone else to "go to Hell".
<FlutterMEDIC> SirGanjalf: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
<weylin|Blarg> FAAAAWWWWWWW
<Barbetos> So cool
<weeping_pegasi82> reminds me of power rangers
<Barbetos> lets watch this for real
<Kandarihu> Another cartoon I was a fan of it's mythos without actually watching. Strangest thing, I actually made a fanart of the toys, of sorts... in the form of a plate I designed for a school project. I think it's still in my cupboard and regularily used.
<FlutterMEDIC> GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
<Ryunosuke> speaking of 3d
<Saturn> 08,01what's this, VR Troopers?
<Ryunosuke> anyone remember .. umm
<CCharmanderK> This predates Power Rangers
<weylin|Blarg> BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
<Barbetos> The whole Tf2 team
<FlutterMEDIC> PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
<Ryunosuke> that robot show?
<Kandarihu> Saturn, Captain Power.
<Barbetos> Er.. TF quake I mean
<weeping_pegasi82> or beetleborgs
<CK|ded> Weird.
<weylin|Blarg> VR Troopers, omg
<Ryunosuke> MASK
<MASF123|TF2> ...
<Suzano> lol
<Saturn> 08,01so much kids shows i've never heard of
<Ryunosuke> this was awesome too
<Kencolt> It predates Power Rangers-- but not Super Sentai.
<Barbetos> Looks lke battle zone
<weeping_pegasi82> MASK?
<killerpony7733> YES
<sub06905> MASK!
<killerpony7733> This this this!
<weeping_pegasi82> nevermind I don't want to know
<Saturn> 08,01oh you americans and your TV programs
<MASF123|TF2> oh gawd...the headaches.
<SirGanjalf> M.A.S.K. - don't confuse with The Mask
<Vordox> Saturn: <.<
*Saturn 08,01should stream Maid Marion and her Merry Men
<Barbetos> Saturn I don't pick them
<MASF123|TF2> I'm gonna take 5 ok
<Soulless_DCLXVI> The only other time I've heard of M.A.S.K. was robot chicken.
<Kandarihu> Captin Power WOULD be generic if not for the toy tie-in. The show sent signals that the toys would recieve and react to. Not sure if it worked or not.
<Saturn> 08,01for a children's show, it was generally fuckign hilariosu
<weeping_pegasi82> oh no an ad! whatever shall I do?
<Barbetos> Besides all the best american shows now are based on european shows
<Saturn> 08,01*genuinely
<Kandarihu> I gotta stop misspelling.
<Sumica> 00,10it worked Kandarihu
<Dark_Horst> i smell a product placement show
<Kinixys> Saturn: Bring it on, then!
<Cypresswolf> I doubt many of these show ever got a dvd release...Ive got to look that up
<CCharmanderK> WE
<CCharmanderK> ARE
<CCharmanderK> VR
<MASF123|TF2> haha :D Just because Staurn mentioned it
<Ryunosuke> we are VR
<weylin|Blarg> XD
<Barbetos> I remember this
<MASF123|TF2> Saturn
<weeping_pegasi82> what, no love for Beetleborgs?
<SirGanjalf> pfft...
<StinkomanFan> DOGGY
<Sumica> 00,10for Saturn
<weylin|Blarg> WE ARE VR, MOTEHRFUCKERS!
<Conyst> Another obligatory AdBlock Plus post
<Saturn> 08,01my god, i hated this show
<Kandarihu> I forgot what this took footage from. I think it's Metal Heroes.
<SirGanjalf> Vitual Realiteh!
<MASF123|TF2> XD
<Barbetos> The 90s had a strange obsesion with virtual reality
<Kinixys> Dungeons and Dragons got a DVD release I know for sure, cause I bought it. That show was actually really good.
<CrystalPhoenix> I think I remember that show
<Sumica> 00,10it sucked so much
<Barbetos> I blame the 80s
<FlutterMEDIC> BACON
<sub06905> i this some knocl off power rangers?
<Ryunosuke> bots master? :p
<Saturn> 08,01you'd think that as a nerd kid who was programming at age 8, this'd be right up my alley
*TrixieMuffin still wants to see Saberrider
<J_E_Smith71> sub06905: It was made by the same guys
<AdamTheDuck> Well that's good Saturn, good luck on your remaning exams :P
<CCharmanderK> Power Rangers spin-off, really
<sub06905> J_E_Smith71: ah
<CCharmanderK> MUCHA LUCHA
<Cypresswolf> Another show I totally forgot about - I remember the theme song though

<FlutterMEDIC> oh look, Mucha Lucha
<Vordox> MUCHA
<Barbetos> Oh
<Vordox> LUCHA
<Kandarihu> Oh, Mucha Lucha!
<SirGanjalf> wat, this nostalgic?
<AdamTheDuck> remaining*
<Barbetos> Awesome show
<StinkomanFan> ME GUSTA
<J_E_Smith71> sub06905: They tried to bring other Japanese live actions shows over after Power Rangers' success
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I liked this
<Suzano> that was cool
<CTHULHU> woooooo

<TrixieMuffin> Saberrider , Cybersix , Captain Future (german opening) , Sailormoon , C.O.P.S.
<Sceptileknight> i dont understand one single thing they said except bonkers
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Was that the mad hatter?

<BroPony|MEDIC> this is great
<Conyst> Wolverine from the jungles of Canada
<CrystalPhoenix> Gambit <3
<Dark_Horst> i always hated wolverines costume though

<Dark_Horst> that yellow looks just stupid on him
<Cypresswolf> still is
<LadyCanary> Kitty Pryde all day errday.

<Vordox> inb4 Beyblade/YuGiOh
<Ryunosuke> MOAR POWAHHH
<Kandarihu> I think this came from the time when I'd actually avoid TV dubbed anime out of concern of overeditting
<weeping_pegasi82> Scootaflew: I would work on your proportioning
<CrystalPhoenix> It's a shame this show didn't catch up well
<Sceptileknight> i liked that one

<LadyCanary> I put a SHOCK to your system~
<Vordox> <--- Now how Static Shock work

<Scootaflew> Static shock was the bomb
<MASF123|TF2> Best Super Hero show based on an African Amercian kid.
<weeping_pegasi82> Scootaflew: draw skeletons and outlines, it really helps
<Sceptileknight> the last chapters were odd
<Kandarihu> I swear, the volume keeps getting lower and lower.

<LadyCanary> He has his own band.
<Kandarihu> Ah, Teen Titans. I liked this show, didn't love it.
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: if we still count 2000 to 2002, max steel
<Scootaflew> weeping_pegasi82: I'm good at outlines and slightly good at undersketches. No good at skeletons
<CrystalPhoenix> I heard the comic was like extremely serious
<Sceptileknight> The last movie was goos
<Sceptileknight> good
<Ryunosuke> puffy ami yumi intro sumica?
<Scootaflew> Teen titans was the stuff

<LadyCanary> Ryunosuke: That was Puffy Ami Yumi
<CK|ded> Raven was my favorite by far. Her sarcastic humor matched my own. ^^
<Dark_Horst> oh that show
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Loud....
<CK|ded> BIG GUY
<Ryunosuke> MURRICA
<Dark_Horst> never could decide on it
*jcelios salutes
<Sceptileknight> i dont know how to answer coments
<Midnight_Splendor> Oh god I miss this show.
<Vordox> Patriotism....
<BroPony|MEDIC> omg, my dad loved this
<Ryunosuke> LadyCanary: they had thier own cartoon
<Vordox> Brain washing
<BroPony|MEDIC> to death
<CK|ded> AMERICA
<weeping_pegasi82> how bout some powerpuff girls theme?
<CrystalPhoenix> CK|ded, lemme guess your favorite pony is Twilight?
<Kandarihu> I didn't like how Teen Titans was billed as anime-esque when the only thing that was anime-style was the facial expressions and the visual cliches.
<LadyCanary> Ryunosuke: OMG THAT YESSSSSS.
<Ryunosuke> IKR
<MASF123|TF2> Hey, Sumica Bobby's World next plz
<weeping_pegasi82> ew he looks ridiculous
<Kandarihu> Ah, I fondly remember Big Guy and Rusty.
<BroPony|MEDIC> AMERICA
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<CK|ded> CrystalPhoenix: Pinkie actually.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Isn't this robot featured in Fallout?
<weylin|Blarg> 'MURICA!
<LadyCanary> I cant say I remember this.
<CrystalPhoenix> CK|ded, oh......ok nvm
<Dark_Horst> Soulless_DCLXVI: naw, that's liberty prime
<J_E_Smith71> Hi Iron Giant..err Big Guy
<SirGanjalf> ginger astroboy
<MASF123|TF2> That CGI show
<LadyCanary> Max Steel. Hm.
<CK|ded> CrystalPhoenix: With Luna being up there too. Why, think I just liked her because Tara? :P
<Sceptileknight> i lost connection goodbye
<Vordox> <-- This show <3
<BrawnyHooves> Reboot?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Ah
<Dark_Horst> i watched this. was awesome enough
<CrystalPhoenix> CK|ded, it was a possibility but heh
<Conyst> use all the nanoprobes
<Sceptileknight> trying but i dont get anything
<Dark_Horst> season one intro was better though
<BroPony|MEDIC> This suddenly made me think of code lyoko
<CrystalPhoenix> CK|ded, also my top 3 is Rarity, Luna and Lyra
<weylin|Blarg> Max Steel was alright
<Kandarihu> Okay, I think I watched some of this but not from the beginning. My memories are too fuzzy for something like this.
<Sumica> 00,10kinda shotty CG
<CrystalPhoenix> Reboot was better
<MASF123|TF2> yeah the toys looked better if I remember
<Sumica> 00,10Starship troopers was better
<LadyCanary> Heehee.
<CK|ded> CrystalPhoenix: Nah, watched Teen Titans long before I knew Tara voiced her. Raven was always my fav, Starfire running second. They both tickled my funny bone better than the other three.
<Kinixys> Has anyone ever seen Ulysses 31?
<Vordox> Sumica: Notreally. :P Compared to...you know, Johnny Quest :p
<BrawnyHooves> Troopers was cool
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: in that period cgi kinda went down
<Conyst> Of course Reboot was better
<CK|ded> And were SCARY when mad.
<Java> no death in starship troopers though
<LadyCanary> ....
<weeping_pegasi82> what
<CrystalPhoenix> OH GAWD

<pony_543> Japanese knockoff
<MASF123|TF2> This is why you do not mix American animation with Japanese animation
<Vordox> HIM!
<LadyCanary> This was actually pretty terrible.
<twilight_sprinkle> BURN IT WITH THE HOLY WATER
<Conyst> of course it exists
<weeping_pegasi82> not what I meant but OK!

<Vordox> Sumica: Panty and Stockings intro? :D
<LadyCanary> I dont think they're even SISTERS in this show.
<MASF123|TF2> Vordox, I can't stand most Anime.
<BroPony|MEDIC> PPG + Z = This?!
<thelonepony|HW> Ohai sprunkls :3

<CK|ded> CrystalPhoenix: "Today is Gorb Gorb, the Tamaranian festival of berating drapery! STUPID CURTAINS!"
<BrawnyHooves> Dragon Pony Z!
<CCharmanderK> PPGZ is actually a good show.
<kidzrul732> If this came to the us, I would burn cartoon network alive
<[]DeadpoolDash> so much bad hentai came from this show
<Vordox> LadyCanary: Don't care, great mix
<cachi01|blackcops2> CCharmanderK: nope
<BroPony|MEDIC> i never heard of this
<SirGanjalf> PPG was remade in Japan?
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: cant decide if awesome or horrible
<MASF123|TF2> I hate THIS
<Java> I lean more on awesome
<Kencolt> This is real. It even had an overarcing plotline. WHY, no9pony knows.
<CTHULHU> the song kicks ass
<CrystalPhoenix> Japan just can't dub
<cachi01|blackcops2> SirGanjalf: yeah it was also aired in the usa and latin america
<Dark_Horst> SirGanjalf: it wasnt. only this spinoff. its not very good
<BroPony|MEDIC> i have lost even more respect for cartoon network
<twilight_sprinkle> THIS COULD JUST BE THE WORST THING JAPAN EVER MADE
<BroPony|MEDIC> YES
<Kandarihu> This anime only happened because they ABHORRED the American original
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: What..Dub?
<FlutterMEDIC> YESH
<cachi01|blackcops2> the intro is awesome but the series is shit
<twilight_sprinkle> caps wups
<LadyCanary> Ah, better.
<kidzrul732> this is much better
<Vordox> WHAT DO YOU MEAN DUB!?
<MASF123|TF2> Better
<CrystalPhoenix> so they make their own shows, with black jack and hookers

<cachi01|blackcops2> burger rain. some stay dry while others feel the grain
<Litwick> what is even anythnig now
<Buytoast> could go for some butgers

<Kinixys> Bovine shaped fluffy clouds.
<Java> But obesity = Murricah?
<[]DeadpoolDash> mustard bukkake
<Conyst> yes it was Buytoast and we know which one should win
<Dark_Horst> that was incredibly freudian
<Kandarihu> CrystalPhoenix, Crash grew large and smashed into a giant anthill filled with all the fast food that ManAnt stole, and he rained it down on his team.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> It's like Japan and America had an illegitamate child.
<Buytoast> well, that's a tough decision
<Buytoast> but still, the cider song is superior
<FlutterMEDIC> wat
<Ryunosuke> SILENCE
<Litwick> oh my god tumblr please fix yourself i'm going on a binge right now for goodness sakes asdf

<LadyCanary> I WAS JUST GONNA SAY StinkomanFan
<Ryunosuke> yes, yes you did
<Buytoast> no, because the cider sliders are the second greatest horses
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I don't think Fausticorn approves of Aquabats, lol
<Buytoast> and its catchy as all hell
<CrystalPhoenix> I love this animation
<thelonepony|HW> Buytoast: true
<CCharmanderK> Whoops, almost forgot to download the new Chuunibyou episode. Better fix that. *does so*

<derpy_h> :'(
<CrystalPhoenix> Voyager
<Sumica> 00,10Time to drive from newyork to england
<CrystalPhoenix> and after that my most favorite song of the album
<Goldframe> this one sounds at home in a 70's disco club
<Kandarihu> Then again, since it's being structured as letters to Princess Celestia, I'd imagine it might have file extensions such as ltc or fim.
<CTHULHU> yeah by the who.
<Kandarihu> Okay, the song AFTER this is my favorite one. I'm certain of it. Veridas Quo
<CrystalPhoenix> Kandarihu, I love you
<Goldframe> veridas quo is after this one
<CrystalPhoenix> also it's Veridis Quo
<Sumica> 00,10noting like driveing cross country in a stoled van with laser holes, blood and a dead body in it
<LadyCanary> ikr

<derpy_h> and they burry him
<CrystalPhoenix> this scene is beautiful though
<LadyCanary> The visuals <3
<derpy_h> in a foreign planet
<Kandarihu> This is awesome too. A kickin' beat and baseline, with some ingeniusly elegant chord progression.
<Eddmario> Sumica: That's what we do every x-mas on our way to our grandparents.
<CrystalPhoenix> Kandarihu, Daft Punk
<derpy_h> :'(
<Goldframe> most modern matsumodo series have excellent visuals
<Java> burying someone?

<Vordox> Best Blue Guy
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Ah

<Goldframe> iirc, I think he's named shep
<Kandarihu> Lotsa 5s. Arc digit

<FlutterMEDIC> Dracula's Castle?
<derpy_h> chrono trigger
<Kandarihu> FlutterMEDIC, Darkwood Manor
<CrystalPhoenix> I love dat gothic feel
<Conyst> Does Not Look Evil At All
<Java> What is a music band?
<Sumica> 00,10good thing the evil lair of evil was on their tom tom
<cachi01|blackcops2> die monster. you dont belong in this world!
<FlutterMEDIC> Kandarihu: i know, but it looks like something Dracula would live in
<cachi01|blackcops2> Java: a miserable pile of rythm?
<CrystalPhoenix> and this is how I love my techno
<Java> Enough talk, now sing!
<CrystalPhoenix> progressively

<LadyCanary> No.. >_>
<Goldframe> drummer
<derpy_h> mmk
<Goldframe> or pirate
<Goldframe> one of the two
<Kandarihu> FlutterMEDIC, it's an evil castle. and the evil record producer is Dracula-esque enough anyway.
<derpy_h> this is chrono trigger like
<CrystalPhoenix> SECRET PASSAGE
<SirGanjalf> FlutterMEDIC: Well, apparently the Bad Guy is a vampire, so you're not that wrong
<Eddmario> Hm, I wonder if there's a Chrono Trigger mod that puts this in the game...
<Sumica> 00,10and then you all understood
<CrystalPhoenix> Mozart
<Eddmario> And here's where the huge twist/plot pointcomes in.
<derpy_h> :O
<derpy_h> no not the cat people
<cachi01|blackcops2> dun dun duuuuuuuuuuun
<Kencolt> He's been doing this for quite a while.
<Kandarihu> All the great musicians are space aliens... but apparently Daft Punk isn't.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Was that a Ferengi?
<Rose`> sacrifice ALL the children
<derpy_h> oh noes
<Sumica> 00,10he's done it 5554 times before
<[]DeadpoolDash> live forever on the backs of alien musicians
<derpy_h> then they throw them into a volcano
<Kencolt> Okay. Conquer the universe by stealing musicians. Heck-- There's been wierder plots in Anime before.
<Java> So those emmies carry mystical powers?
<Ponies47> Mooooooooooo O3O
<derpy_h> MOOOOOO
<thelonepony|HW> Ponies47: Moooooo O3O
<CrystalPhoenix> Kencolt, it's original at least
<derpy_h> NOOOOOO
<Eddmario> Kencolt: And some of them actually made sense, depending on the anime in question.
<Goldframe> Kencolt: You've seen enough tentacle to see where this is going?
<Rose`> one arm that bitch
<RainbowDerpy> IM BACK!
<derpy_h> ded
<Kencolt> I've seen enough anime to see tat the big bad's plan is about to go south.
<derpy_h> world domination by records
<derpy_h> head shot
<Major> Night all
<Barbetos> The robuts did it.
<FlutterMEDIC> BEWM, DOUBLE HEADSHOT
<Kandarihu> So, did they know those guards are robots?
<SirGanjalf> And that's why record companies are evil, kids.
<derpy_h> smeagle all over again
<LadyCanary> OOH.
<CrystalPhoenix> and now THIS ACTION PUMPED SONG
<Barbetos> Run away!!
<Kandarihu> SirGanjalf, not all record companies.
<Java> jump jump!
<Conyst> run now
<Barbetos> Cults these days.
<[]DeadpoolDash> cheezit
<CrystalPhoenix> SHORT CIRCUIT
<Rose`> suicide bots
<derpy_h> and then they all died the end
<Barbetos> They are all on about their rock and roll
<Kencolt> But, of course, not before...
<Barbetos> and lava
<derpy_h> of nvm
<spypengen> it's the red lava gak
<CrystalPhoenix> mood whiplash
<Suzano> I aproove of Suumicas Pony animation :D

<Barbetos> Priceless book? Lets just rip this page out.
<Rose`> Suzano, isnt it just the most adorable thing?
<rdash> GAK
<derpy_h> at the perfect moment
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Ueah, it's cute.
<spypengen> that word kicks you
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Yeah*
<Eddmario> France VS Japan. I GET IT@
<Suzano> Im planing drawing her Rose :3
<LadyCanary> Idiot. >_>
<derpy_h> mgs
<LadyCanary> And OH I SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE Eddmario XD
<LadyCanary> HA!
<Kandarihu> Gee, just one of those golden discs falling off the ledge blows up the whole castle. That accident could've happened 5554 times before, a little OSHA compliance might've stopped that.
<Sumica> 00,10Cant wait to see
<CrystalPhoenix> Lawl
<derpy_h> hit man
<Barbetos> Wow. Janitor midget got tall.
*Kandarihu slaps himself around with a large seapony.
<Rose`> are you going to draw it omg adorbz?
<Suzano> well your in a queue XD i promised my friend 1st XD
<SirGanjalf> "Aren't you a little tall for a janitor?"
<CrystalPhoenix> 2-1 France
<derpy_h> oh noes
<Sumica> 00,10Tazzed the black right out of him
<SirGanjalf> Don't tase him, bro!
<Barbetos> ded
<CrystalPhoenix> OSHIT
<derpy_h> dun dun duuuuuuuun
<Barbetos> That is one crazy tazer
<Sumica> 00,10meanwhile at mount doom
<Kandarihu> I have a friend who's a police chaplain. He talked to me about tasers. I think it might be funny to show him that out of context.
<Rose`> tentacoos
<Kencolt> Barbetos: That was actually a "stun gun", a sort of proto-taser.
<Rose`> unf~
<CrystalPhoenix> Face to Face
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, oh yeah. You're right.
<Goldframe> now this is a good track
<Conyst> that is a strong taser
<Kandarihu> In this world, Darkwood is the only evil record producer. And the owner of the record company is a cool guy.
<CrystalPhoenix> CONSPIRACY
<r-dash> hello
<CrystalPhoenix> dat kid
<twilight_sprinkle> what were the gold discs though? i was kinda watching two movies at once
<Eddmario> DAT KID'S FACE!
<Barbetos> Not the chip!
<Goldframe> Aliens
<LadyCanary> What's goin on~
<derpy_h> finally words
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Symbol for greed
<Barbetos> Love this song.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: so he needed 5555 of them just for fun?
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, hard to explain. They were awards for the best musicians, and they were also part of Darkwood's plot to gain the power to conquer the universe.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i still dont get what the discs are, just some weapon for taking over?
<LadyCanary> Aw :3
<Kandarihu> So the rest of them were tased under friendlier terms
<derpy_h> yay smurfs
<Java> I blue myself
<Barbetos> Dethclock status
<LadyCanary> That's so cute!
<SirGanjalf> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/31793246.jpg - atleast he's right this time
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I'm not entirely sure myself
<Kencolt> It's no worse than the plot of Gattaiga, which was the Demon Motor Company plot to conquer earth by winning auto races.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Kandarihu twilight_sprinkle their memories unaltered where in those disks
<CrystalPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/JDcpp.jpg
<Sumica> 00,10the disk was infused with the tallent and power of the artist
<Kandarihu> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I see.
<Barbetos> Real animes involve world domination of some sort
<Sumica> 00,10with enough of them he could take over every thing
<Kandarihu> Barbetos, not all of them
<Rose`> too soon for a challenger joke?
<derpy_h> evrything?
<Kencolt> They were poopsed by Team Gettaiga, which drove five ver fast race cars that combined into.. one really big race car. Kind of a mix of Gatchaman and Speed Racer.
<CrystalPhoenix> and now for the longest track of the album
<CrystalPhoenix> Too long
<Conyst> yes it is
<Sumica> 00,10KSP needs rail launches like that
<CrystalPhoenix> cause this track is WAY TOO LONG
<CTHULHU> spaaaaaace!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
<CrystalPhoenix> I wonder who did those vocals
<Barbetos> Supa mang
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: did he absorb their powers using the discs, or somehow they were already in the discs? and who made them adn why did he have to win them?
<Kandarihu> CrystalPhoenix, Daft Punk
<Eddmario> Can you tell that the guy singing this is white and french?
<derpy_h> oh no
<CrystalPhoenix> Kandarihu, have they really?
<Shizuka> 13no i can't feel it
<Shizuka> 13CAN YOU FEEL IT NOW MISTER KRABS?
<CrystalPhoenix> man they've lost their accent
<Barbetos> Who?
<LadyCanary> Im feeling something alright Shizu
<derpy_h> ,ister krabs
<CrystalPhoenix> Barbetos, Daft Punk
<derpy_h> mister krabs*
<LadyCanary> OH SH-
<derpy_h> o.
<Rose`> eww
<Rose`> vore.
<[]DeadpoolDash> seen enough hentai to know where this is going
<Sumica> 00,10the have to some how be reconised as great artist and then he uses that machine he tosed the chick in to to extract it
<CrystalPhoenix> BBG
<CrystalPhoenix> ;-;
<twilight_sprinkle> i look away for a second a giant black ball with a head eats them
<Barbetos> naked blue

<Sumica> 00,10creaped out*
<CrystalPhoenix> the album music video for Discovery by Daft Punk
<twilight_sprinkle> this story mustve been written by thelonepony|HW
<Kandarihu> A deceased loved one to the record. That's pretty much Shinto.
<[]DeadpoolDash> super creeper fan
<SpeccyRush> dat freudian slip sumi
<Eddmario> Sumica: Creamed out seemed more sexual in nature
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I think creamed'd be more accurate, lol
<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<thelonepony|HW> twilight_sprinkle: No <_<
<derpy_h> XD
<Eddmario> Shizuke: We should watch Tommy next@
<Java> They don't bring his dead body back?
<CTHULHU> and the wall.
<twilight_sprinkle> did stream died&
<twilight_sprinkle> *?
<CrystalPhoenix> Java, they do something better
<derpy_h> nope
<Kandarihu> Java, it's nourishing plants on an alien planet now.
<Sumica> 00,10and only too late they relised taht the space watch beafed up security and fired on any aproching ship
<thelonepony|HW> twilight_sprinkle: but i know thtat no one in productiton of this did not use any drugs, specificly pot <_<
<twilight_sprinkle> ok nvm
<Eddmario> CTHULHU: Doesn't The Wall require some drug use to watch though?
<CrystalPhoenix> and then they jam
<Java> Blue nourishment
<Java> And then they shot down the plane
<derpy_h> oh no its the space watch
<SirGanjalf> Soylent Blue is aliens!
<Shizuka> 13bleh... daft punk is way way too repetitive...
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony|HW: that much is obvious
<Kandarihu> They only beefed up security to the point where the space watch is keeping their eyes on the friggin' radar.
<[]DeadpoolDash> lets all play music and not fly the ship
<CTHULHU> it really but it dose make it a lot more awesome.
<Java> Beefed up security = turn around
<derpy_h> XD
<thelonepony|HW> twilight_sprinkle: i know, i suck at lieing ._.
<Eddmario> []DeadpoolDash: It's on autopilot
<Sumica> 00,10dont know how to land
<Kandarihu> []DeadpoolDash, autopilot ftw
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony|HW: *lying

*twilight_sprinkle smacks thelonepony|HW around a bit with a large cow
*twilight_sprinkle blocks the chancla

<Conyst> any landing you walk away from is a good landing
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: time for the Launchpad Mcquack method

<bigmac> the brohoove
<cachi01> I tarzan
<cachi01> U bring tarzan food
<Kandarihu> Conyst, my theory to that is the world on which Equestria lies has very short years... and a pony that takes good care of their bodies can live for hundreds of these years.
<Evil_Spike> Oh derpy...

<Sliverfish> Will she be in the theatre?
<twilight_sprinkle> no
<thelonepony|HW> and it will be after.... no
<Dark92Enigma> TRIVIA: This episode was recorded before the name Derpy became official, thus the reason why The Doctor calls her Ditzy.
<thelonepony|HW> and it will be after the Episode i might add
<twilight_sprinkle> Sliverfish: some of the celestia radio interviewers will be the mods here though
<Evil_Spike> Oh shit

<Conyst> Adventure is out there.
<Kandarihu> CCharmanderK, ^
<CrystalPhoenix> lawl
<bigmac> yay metropolis zone part 1 done
<Dark92Enigma> Gilligan Cut: a classic staple of comedy in which someone announces something forcefully and the scene immediately cuts to the same character doing something in direct contradiction to what he just said.
<CrystalPhoenix> I want to watch Gilligan island now
<CrystalPhoenix> ROCK
<Dark92Enigma> CCharmanderK: me too!
<Dark92Enigma> GO TOM!

<CrystalPhoenix> cachi01, nah
<Sumica> 00,10silly dorctor is silly

<Conyst> He is so Exciteable
<CCharmanderK> I'm the Doctor, Master of Pickeruppery!

<otakon> Sumica: Doctor is always silly

<Kencolt> The OTHER series doesn't have pockets. Resulting in... many baps from TWilight on this doctor.
<otakon> I like BDR's rendition of Derpy
<Evil_Spike> Nopony does Ditzy

<CCharmanderK> HOW DO THEY STILL LIVE?!
<AttackWithHugs> At least it won't explo--never mind
<texasboykc09> again
<weylin|Blarg> That's a pretty solid capsule
<Kinixys> Budget cuts?
<texasboykc09> ^
<xles> Good morning #bronystat.
<weylin|Blarg> xles: Hello
<texasboykc09> xles: hello
<Kinixys> Good eve/morn xles
<CrystalPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5nv6xr
<thelonepony|HW> Hi xles
<xles> 0500, already made mornin' tea and all that jazz. Been up since 0415.
<CCharmanderK> LOLNOPE
<texasboykc09> boom
<texasboykc09> they live
<texasboykc09> again
<CCharmanderK> And this is why I love it when Sumi streams Kerbal Space Program.
<texasboykc09> ^
<weylin|Blarg> The Aero-Space Execution Initiative is disappoint
<Kurra> xles, likeawinner
<AttackWithHugs> Oh Sumica, you and your Kerbal death machines <3
<xles> Kurra: Yeah, because all winners go up at bumfuck early to work minwage. ;)
<Kurra> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Kurra> MINIMUM WAGE BROHOOF /)
<CCharmanderK> Bumfuck early. Gotta remember that one.
<Kinixys> Awright!
<texasboykc09> it flys
<xles> (Well technically minwage doesn't even exist over here, and compaired to the US, this would be sub-minwage)
<xles> Kurra: (\
<Shizuka> 13yay artificially raising the price of labor!
<CCharmanderK> Shizu!!
<CrystalPhoenix> can't you try to simulate the Nasa spaceship?
<texasboykc09> hello Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13sorry... back to minecraft before i get embroiled in politics..
<Kurra> well then brohoof whatever wage there is, because wage is wage after all. D:
<weylin|Blarg> evening, Shizu
<xles> Kurra: Quite right.
<CCharmanderK> Sumica, you fucked up AGAIN.
<Kinixys> lol
<xles> Kurra: Glad I could get this shit job. =)
<Kurra> Artificially raising price of labor has some detrimental effects, it creates a lack of labor and a lack of money flow. :>
<weylin|Blarg> that lone rocket
<Kurra> which is weird, considering that you'd think minimum wage was made to make things more fair for people. Economics can be fascinating.
<texasboykc09> Sumica: yep
*Hanako sighs
<CCharmanderK> CLEARLY.
<Hanako> got some conservatives up in here
<CCharmanderK> Oh, hi Hanako.
<xles> I would prefer if I managed to acquire a shitty job I was better suited for, like being the lowest level code monkey there is. But I wouldn't hire a hack programmer such as myself either. =D
<Kurra> well it's okay--
<Hanako> even worse than the liberals and that's saying something
<CCharmanderK> :D
<DaringDerpy> the most destructive effect of a high minimum wage is an extreme youth unemployment
<weylin|Blarg> ^
<Kurra> Hanako, I live for the day when people see people as people, and no longer how liberal or conservative they are c:
<oh> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb3HxQgjZWQ
<Kurra> YES THAT DaringDerpy
<Hanako> I live for the day when people don't push their stupid and unworkable worldviews onto others
<Kurra> and also, you can't get as much done as you want. I know people who'd work for less than minwage, and it'd be such a great benefit for them still :s
<Kurra> I had pesto :d
<Yahooz> dat video link
<weylin|Blarg> mmm, pesto
<Kurra> er, b:
<thelonepony|HW> No video links during stream
<texasboykc09> there it goes
<CCharmanderK> ONCE MORE, WITH PEPTO
<Ryunosuke> well there is a problem when one has to work 2-3 jobs just to hit the national poverty line
<oh> shut up lonepony
<Kurra> >_(\
<thelonepony|HW> oh: noa
<thelonepony|HW> naw*
<thelonepony|HW> :>
<DaringDerpy> oh?
<oh> OH BROTHER THIS GUY STINKS
<Hanako> if you can not afford basic neccessities on minimum wage
<Kurra> oh, it is one of the regulations of channel c.c
<DaringDerpy> and kick
<Hanako> something is wrong
<Kurra> D8
<CCharmanderK> They died.
<oh> OH, KICK! oh nooo dont kick
<texasboykc09> ded
<CCharmanderK> Whee!!
<DaringDerpy> just as planned
<weylin|Blarg> The Aero-Space Execution Initiative is now pleased
<DaringDerpy> again!
<Goldframe> yup....they ded
<Hanako> just saiyan
<nerf_soldier> Can we have an instant repplay of that?
<oh> because i toooootally care if some 45-year old stupid bronies kick me from a fucking gayass chat!
<CCharmanderK> weylin|Blarg: YES
<DaringDerpy> protip: don't explode

<xles> oh dear
<CCharmanderK> Hi, Shizuka!
<Kinixys> His name was apt.
<Ryunosuke> well shit there goe sthat
<Shizuka> 13rarely is a nick so appropriate
<texasboykc09> gj Sumica
<DaringDerpy> everything was on fire
<Ryunosuke> I was gonna say "see ya, dont let the door hit your ass on the way out
<Ryunosuke> .....
<weylin|Blarg> Let the Kerbal Space Program know that they can expect their one million Kerbin-Dollars in the mail next week
<Ryunosuke> by celestia's beard
<Ryunosuke> there's a troll name if i seen one
<Ryunosuke> [23:11:39] Prince_Blueblood [a@his.royal.pain] has joined #bronystate ---- *facepalm*
<Java> So let say this is Kerbal version of NASA. I wonder what Kerbal version of Russian space project team
<CCharmanderK> The Kerbals know they're gonna die.
<thelonepony|HW> Ryunosuke: well its ttrue
<thelonepony|HW> true*
<Prince_Blueblood> lol
<Prince_Blueblood> me, a troll
<Prince_Blueblood> no, just an angry cynic
<CCharmanderK> OH SHIT
<Kurra> DDDDD8
<Ryunosuke> oh no
<DaringDerpy> you lost a part or two
<weylin|Blarg> Another million for the KSP!
<Ryunosuke> you are not an angry cynic :)
<Goldframe> the correct response should've been, and now to play god
<Prince_Blueblood> my motto is "get rich or die trying"
<Kurra> Sumicarocket is best drift car
<xles> Oh no. The horror. =(

<texasboykc09> Sumica: whats the - side
<Java> speaking too soon?
<DaringDerpy> how much fuel left?
<Kurra> Tee und cafee.
<Kurra> DaringDerpy, green bars is fuel, red is... damamge or overheating I think
<xles> They moved the bus schedule around though, so now I get to catch a bus that leaves after 0600. Yay!
<weylin|Blarg> Coffee and tea sound good for next week ;A;

<ouo> we need nuclear engine stuck with light engine
<Kandarihu> In the wierd side of my mind, there needs to be more pony OCs named less like characters from MLP and more like racehorses.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Kandarihu: lol can ya name a few?
<Kandarihu> Sketch_Toku_Brony, no. I've never seen it happen.
<weylin|Blarg> Kandarihu: So, kinda like "The Whistling Bushsnake"?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol yeah like that :D
<weylin|Blarg> There are oddly enough, horses in races that have names such as "The -insert whatever here-
<ouo> aaa
<Kandarihu> weylin|Blarg, that would be a good one to start. But more like the kinds of names that seem like they were simply made to troll the announcer.

<Afflict> today is 12/12/12
<ouo> http://www.from-ua.com/images/articles/c224346-start.jpg
<Stallion_of_War> It annoys me that SRWare Iron uses the Chromium engine, yet Adblock plus doesn't work on it...
<Kinixys> ouo That's not how pyramids work..I'm pretty sure.
<weylin|Blarg> Knixys: Stargate. 'nuff said
<Kandarihu> Stallion_of_War, really? That's a problem
<ouo> yeah... in your dreams
<Kimori> oh
<Kimori> whats funny is I didnt pay attention to that at all
<Stallion_of_War> Kandarihu: It's basically Chrome, but it doesn't report your data back to Google.
<Java> That's a perfect separation scene
<Kandarihu> Stallion_of_War, I know. I have it too. I don't use it much, though.
<Kurra> ouo XDDDDDDDDD
<Stallion_of_War> Kandarihu: I tried to use Off By One, but it's a little TOO lightweight...
<Kurra> guh, so tired and wanna abuse sweets
<weylin|Blarg> In the shadows, that looks awfully suggestive
<Java> You want to abuse swwetie belle?
<Stallion_of_War> Just... just do a barrel roll
<Kurra> No, more like sugar cookies. Java, eww on you man. >:C
<Java> i know, I'm just joking Kurra
<Stallion_of_War> Kandarihu: I tried using Firefox and either Chrome or SR and I noticed like, a 5 second stream lag with FF so...
<Kandarihu> Stallion_of_War, hmm, that's interesting.
<Kurra> Why not use Stainless?
<texasboykc09> penguins enjoying the night http://webcams.galveston.com/docs/penguins/penguinsmp.jpg?1355375578973
<ouo> they are in SPACE
<Kandarihu> Who is Sumica responding to?
<Stallion_of_War> LUNA!!!!
<ouo> yay
<ouo> rawr
<texasboykc09> Sumica: lol
<weylin|Blarg> He's talking to the voices in his head
<Stallion_of_War> Nope Sumica, no you cant :P
<ouo> inb4 yay
<Ta_Dikin> What's this Game?
<weylin|Blarg> Kerbal Space Program, Ta_Dikin
<Kurra> Kerbal Space Program.
<ouo> TO THE MOOON
<Ta_Dikin> Luna?
<texasboykc09> Sumica: uhh what
*Stallion_of_War Blows on a whistle OF WAR
*Stallion_of_War STABALIZE ME! STABALIZE ME!
<Stallion_of_War> And in 100 years James T. Kerbal finds the space ship full of sleeping Kerbals, one of which is named Kahn...
<Ryunosuke> wait, Luna? where?
<weylin|Blarg> KAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN-KERBAL!
<Stallion_of_War> OHH NOES HE'S NOT GOING TO MEET LUNA :'(
*Kurra sleepy =.=
<Java> *cough*
<texasboykc09> ^
<Stallion_of_War> You know why Sumi started this space program? To protect his jam from Brian Blessed.
<texasboykc09> Sumica: you thimk
<texasboykc09> *think
*thelonepony puts Kurra to bread :3
*Kurra peanutbutters all over bread
<Java> kinky
<Stallion_of_War> He bought 48 jars of jam from the store, then put the jam in a cupboard, then took the cupboard off the wall and put it in a safe.
<Ryunosuke> Space, the final frontier, These are the voyages of the starship Kerbalprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, the seek out new life forms and noew civilizations, to boldy go where no kerbal has gone before.
*Kurra chunky and rich, a yummy snack! Available at your local grocery.
<Java> And not die a horrible horrible deathc
<Stallion_of_War> Then he put the safe in a slightly larger safe and entered a random string of digits as the password; then burried the safe in the woods, and then tar and concrete'd the woods
<Java> tar nation approve of the use of tar here
<Stallion_of_War> then he dug up the woods and put them on this space ship, and now he's going to the moon to put the woods in a hole he's going to blast in the middle of the moon.
<texasboykc09> Sumica: you are
<ouo> http://troll-face.ru/static/images/barack_michelle_face.jpg not bad orbit
<Kurra> Brian Blessed is strangely obsessed with tubs of jell-yyyy? o/~
<Stallion_of_War> Then he's going to knock the moon out of orbit so it goes into deep space where an alien race will coat the moon in a diamond dome
<Stallion_of_War> And his jam will finally be safe from Brian Blessed
<Ta_Dikin> ^
*Kurra is entertained by Stallion_of_War, wants to see how long he can keep this up :D
<texasboykc09> Sumica: can you build some plans after this?
<Stallion_of_War> And then Sumica can come down and have jam on toast in the morning; only to realize that he can't because it's on the bloomin' moon that's in another galaxy...
<texasboykc09> *planes
<texasboykc09> Sumica: yay
<ouo> yay
<Valhalla_Fusion> Umm so Pony ep every sat?

<Stallion_of_War> ohh FFS the abbriviation triggers a chat ping too...
<Deadlypon3> ...Sumica Stop being sumica and be saturn :'(
<Stallion_of_War> That's the whole point of abbriviations
<Stallion_of_War> Cause then you'd be a scottish levar burtan?
<Kurra> Or be Ganymede or Callisto
<texasboykc09> Sumica: game hates you
<Stallion_of_War> Maybe the ship is under acceleration since you're not sitting still?
<Java> break break
<Stallion_of_War> and this is where I'd put my atmosphere... IF I HAD ONE!

<Java> Slow down slow down!
<Barbetos> I dunnoo
<Deadlypon3> ...AD
<Ta_Dikin> Yay~
<weylin|Blarg> that awkward symmetry to the lunar surface...
<Barbetos> Well I dun play this game at all, so I will take your word for it.
<Stallion_of_War> We're going to need something to get home people
<Java> a paddle?
<Deadlypon3> Sumica do you have gary oldman in there :D?
<Deadlypon3> And will you demand that he 'gets off' your lunar module :p
<Deadlypon3> ...
<Deadlypon3> Did you land?
<Deadlypon3> ...Hellos?
<Barbetos> no
<Java> ssshhh
<Stallion_of_War> Still a good 2 km up
<Barbetos> This is intense
<Java> this is the most important part
<Barbetos> Coming in a bit hot capn
<Barbetos> there we go
<Barbetos> I am scured
<Java> scured?
<Deadlypon3> Doh no
<Deadlypon3> ...

<Stallion_of_War> Well that was certianly a thing!
<Barbetos> Celestia did it wrong.

<texasboykc09> lol
<Barbetos> You move dat way
<weylin|Blarg> The ASEI has wired one billion Kerbal-Dollars to the KSP. You're Welcome
<discslash> luna do not want your weir module there
<Ta_Dikin> He died
<texasboykc09> Sumica: what a wast of time and money
<Ta_Dikin> sad day
<Stallion_of_War> LOL flight errors: Died
<Barbetos> No. We wanted to comPLANE
<Barbetos> Get it.
<Barbetos> EH?
<Java> *cough cough*
<Stallion_of_War> We have to get to warp 1 somehow!
<Barbetos> Go into the ini
<Java> What are we? Federatiion fleet?
<Barbetos> and edit the values
<Barbetos> Done.
<Kinixys> So how does Kerbal persuasion work? I'm sure they must need a lot to ride in these craft.
*Stallion_of_War it's been a long time... gettin' from there to here!
<texasboykc09> Sumica: i remember when Phase4 made a car in plane building
<Java> you need front fins
<Stallion_of_War> No no no, you need to put the warp engines in the back, not wings
<texasboykc09> Sumica: wheels
<Stallion_of_War> not wheels, a giant moon plow
<Stallion_of_War> we need to plant moon wheat
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<Stallion_of_War> How exactly did you expect us to make moon pies without a moon plow?
<Stallion_of_War> LUNA NEEDS HER MOON PIES
<discslash> Shut up and take my money
<texasboykc09> Sumica: looks awlsome
<Java> it will ruin the aerodynamic of that plane
<NocturnalBlade> dat plane lol
<Java> helight
<texasboykc09> cant spell fpr crap
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, those panels will snap off in the atmosphere
<texasboykc09> *for
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Howdy
<Phase4> 00,02but it looks cool so DO IT!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: SHH dont tell him that!
<texasboykc09> hello Phase4
<NocturnalBlade> ohai SpadeKyurem[WoW]
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> We want to see the carnage
<Stallion_of_War> We all know how well things breaking off of spaceships is!
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Java> so many spelling mistakes X(
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: Are you gonna accidentally the kerbals?
<Stallion_of_War> It never ends in firy doom or anything
<Stallion_of_War> Crud it's late; brain are no spelling
<Java> Just slap several JATOs and be done with it.
<Ta_Dikin> seems legit.
<Java> ahahahah
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<Kinixys> Solar.. panels?
<Java> We will use the power of the SUNNNNNNNN!
<Stallion_of_War> lol gone already
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh dear
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> its shaking
<Ta_Dikin> sumon celestia!
*SpadeKyurem[WoW] gets popcorn
<Phase4> 00,02that is a nice looking plane
<Kinixys> Looks cool.
<discslash> dis goin to be gud
<texasboykc09> Phase4: i like your car better
<Java> that doesn't sound good...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SAS WUT R U DOIN
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SAS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> STAHP
<Stallion_of_War> You need to put the wings on backwards
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Do a barrel roll!
<Phase4> 00,02i still want to try build a submarine
<discslash> owowowowÃ§
<Barbetos> He hit all da buttons
<Barbetos> and butts
<Ta_Dikin> Yay!
<Phase4> 00,02Weeeeee
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: But it isnt water proof
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DIVE DIVE
<Barbetos> Going down!
<anton> airplane breakdance
<Kinixys> Pull a tailspin.
<texasboykc09> Phase4: i would love to see that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> POOF
<Kinixys> Aww
<texasboykc09> splash
<Stallion_of_War> spoosh
<MirrorImage> did i see a rocket plane?
<Ta_Dikin> Splosh
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> 10 points!
<Barbetos> It has, as per kerbal design, great crash control.
<texasboykc09> ^
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Barbetos: of course, thats required by kerbal law
<Java> now we're talking!
<Java> front fins!
<Barbetos> The moustache of planes
<weylin|Blarg> i'm off to bed. g'night all. it's been...a blast :D
<Java> *cough*
<Barbetos> Now give it a mullet and a six pack
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ARE YOU SHURE THIS VILL VORK?!
<discslash> looking good, really good
<texasboykc09> Sumica: you think that will work
<Barbetos> Then it will have good reason to crash.
<Ta_Dikin> mustache will make this 20% cooler
<MirrorImage> texasboykc09 - he built it, so the answer is yes
<MirrorImage> now "Will it work" is a compeltely different question
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: Are you sure this vill work?
<Ta_Dikin> yay
<Java> the answer is always "maybe"
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not sure its possible to build a submarine with stock parts, i'm reading about a mod to do it and the masses they're talking about far exceed stock parts
<texasboykc09> MirrorImage: you had to ping me when my sound is all the way up.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Popcorn anyone?
<Barbetos> That kerbal does not appreciate the flight
<Barbetos> Time to crash it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: ADD MOAR ROCKETS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MOAR
<Phase4> 00,02^
<MirrorImage> now can you land it?
<Kinixys> I bet most of the budget goes into crash safety.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Rockets solve everything
<discslash> ^^
<Barbetos> Need more bacon too
<Ta_Dikin> barrol roll?
<MirrorImage> let me rephrase that...
<MirrorImage> can you land it "safely"?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> GEDDAN!
<twilight_sprinkle> https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5RHWpBo4x_w/UMY7v5_LxPI/AAAAAAAAOuQ/Fy0Cpk7J5kU/s1600/TrixiesHearthsWarmingCarol.png
<Barbetos> Thats normal
<Barbetos> WHOA!
<Barbetos> Shorten LINKS
<Phase4> 00,02<< this is why i always add parachutes
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> twilight_sprinkle: So who would Bob Cratchit be?
<texasboykc09> ^^
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: Pansy
<Barbetos> Doing it wrong phase.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> REAL MEN DONT USE SAFTEY DEVICES
<Java> It has bad lift control, but it looks cool. That's all that matter
<texasboykc09> Sumica: you dont:O
<discslash> meh, the kerbal can die, save the plane
<Barbetos> HERE IN MURICA WE DIES LIKE MENS
<Phase4> 00,02i should try a powered landing mun misson one day
<Phase4> 00,02i've got a craft that MIGHT be able to do it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If Sumica lands this I will be impressed
<twilight_sprinkle> Barbetos: im pretty sure 4 line link is ok
<ouo> twilight_sprinkle, "Now Trixie can we join you here?"
<MirrorImage> central rudder for stability?
<Barbetos> Why not one line it when possible?
<Barbetos> Better to not risk it
<Phase4> 00,02yup
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The...what?
<Phase4> 00,02its awesome
<Java> Perfect for bomber planes though
<Barbetos> Besides it don't matter, only if the mods get mad, eh twilight_sprinkle ?
<Phase4> 00,02buit a suborbital plane and had it flame out on me XD
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Did I hear...flame..out?
<thelonepony> i need to got to sleep, night everyone :)
<JRP2234|Ghost> Phase4 thunder
<MirrorImage> yes SpadeKyurem[WoW]
<Phase4> 00,02had to shift fule mid flight to avoid crashing
<MirrorImage> get too high and there's no oxygen to burn
<MirrorImage> or not enough anyways
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234|Ghost, indeed, none here tnough
<MirrorImage> so engines go *poof*
<Java> put 6 jet engines?
<Phase4> 00,02speaking of which, fuel transfer is awesome :3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Wait so actual physics are implemented?
<JRP2234> Phase4 radar?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HE DID
<MirrorImage> 0_o
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> IT
<Barbetos> did not need em
<MirrorImage> wait, that worked?
<ouo> de
<twilight_sprinkle> Barbetos because when i have 35 tabs open, opening a link-shortening site is troublesome.
<ouo> d
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> AMAZING!
<Barbetos> doesn'tmatathadsex
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Something broke
<discslash> still nailed it
<Java> there goes the exhaust ports
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What fell off?
<texasboykc09> Phase4: i should watch you play this soon
<discslash> :close enough:
<Barbetos> Hydrolics
<texasboykc09> nice landing
<Java> *cough*
<Barbetos> I like the lad... rockets with plenty of tail
<Java> so.... basic
<Arcium> What is this game really called?
<Barbetos> Kerbal Space Program
<Arcium> Hi! btw ^^
<Phase4> 00,02in real life that breaks aerodynamics so bad, in the game though it migth work
<Java> what is that?
<Java> JATO? missiles?
<ouo> i just wonder if he add parts for fasion or for better aerodynamic
<Barbetos> Looks like speakers
<texasboykc09> ^
<Java> *cough cough* two times
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, try clime to about 20KM and accelerate
<Arcium> ^^
<Phase4> 00,02this thing should make it to about 1.5KM/s
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> NEEDS MOAR BOOST
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MOAR
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, i probably assume too much
<discslash> awesome bass for best rockets
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You know what this ship needs?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> More rockets
<discslash> it needs more bass
<MirrorImage> "funny wing bit?" You can have a rubber chicken as a tail fin?
<Arcium> Sumica, if u use a sterringwheel and a joystick at the same time it's easyer to controll :D
<MirrorImage> i do <_<
<MirrorImage> and yet i'm too cheap to go buy the full version of this
<Java> I think I will call that plane Taurus Jet.....
<discslash> now that plane is more horny
<Arcium> dat smoke
<Phase4> 00,02i have to reboot quickly, hopefully i'm back before the interesting bits
<texasboykc09> lol
<Kurra> oh lawl
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WELP
<Arcium> won't the pieces in the front make the airripple!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SO MUCH FOR HIM
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Some one inform his widow
<discslash> so much bass
<texasboykc09> boom ded
<Arcium> BOOOM
<MirrorImage> so what were those front engines for?
<Java> take off slowly
<Arcium> Slowly now'
<Phase4|1> 00,02still o the runway?
<Arcium> he crashed
<MirrorImage> Phase4 - take 2
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<MirrorImage> it's no longer a jet and now it's a bird
<Ta_Dikin> Yay
<texasboykc09> yep
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MirrorImage: A glorious majestic bird
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> God speed bird
<Arcium> maybe the pieces in front of the engine
<ouo> remove mustaches from front
<Phase4> 00,02maybe the tailplane is blocking the exaust? it does simulate that
<MirrorImage> i'd bet it's those front wings are blocking airflow
<Java> move the tail plane up
<MirrorImage> or those turbines you have on the front
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh god
<MirrorImage> dive dive dive!
<MirrorImage> *sploosh*
<texasboykc09> splash
<sub06905> lel
<Kurra> yah!
<texasboykc09> hope the kerbal know how to swim
<Kurra> make it like that old 70s jet!
<Java> Sabre?
<Java> yes!
<Arcium> there you go
<MirrorImage> and then the runway ends
<otakon> yay!
<Arcium> xD
<ouo> ded\
<otakon> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<texasboykc09> boom dead
<Java> the tail looks like F4 Phantom
<texasboykc09> lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WELP
*Kurra clapclaps XD
<otakon> AND IT IS COOKED WELL DONE
<Ta_Dikin> Lololololololololololol
<Phase4> 00,02BEST PLANE EVER
<Java> remove the horn?
<texasboykc09> ^
<ouo> deep fried
<MirrorImage> double the engines and try again?
<otakon> well done Sumica I come back to GREATNESS
<otakon> Sumica: bigger wings?
<ouo> yay
<Arcium> YAY''
<ouo> we need bigger plane
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So who's gonna inform his wife?
<MirrorImage> bigger wings would only make the problem worse i would think
<Arcium> Perfect
<discslash> cant handle that awesomeness
<MirrorImage> more surface to affect the aero
<MirrorImage> if anything, remove all the wings and just make a missile
<texasboykc09> ^
<otakon> MirrorImage: even missiles have stabilizer fins
<ouo> pilot enjoing
<MirrorImage> yes, but they're extremely small
<otakon> Sumica: is it upside down?
<Arcium> I dont think its going to make i though :P
<otakon> a'www I lost audio
<ouo> do a barrely roll
<MirrorImage> try flipping it upside-down? it might maintain altitude better
<otakon> ouo: you did it wrong
<Java> no
<Arcium> it makes
<Arcium> sense
<Arcium> less
<Arcium> airripples
<Phase4> 00,02might want to have the resources window open to check airflow
<texasboykc09> Sumica: GO TO THE MOON WITH IT
<Phase4> 00,02its going to be getting a little low now
<MirrorImage> still in the atmosphere?
<Java> then suddenly no oxygen
<Arcium> DO YOU LIKE BANANAS
<MirrorImage> 0_o
<Arcium> knew it
<otakon> oh lord
<Phase4> 00,02this is not so good
<[]DeadpoolDash> beware pony people, this weekend's episode has leaked onto the interwebs
<MirrorImage> lost an engine...
<otakon> THE KERBAL IS GOING NUTS
<Arcium> BLOWOUT!
<sub06905> oh boy
<otakon> look at him, the LOOK OF HORROR!
<texasboykc09> noo
<MirrorImage> ladies and gentlemen, the Red Bull Kerbal Space Jump
<Arcium> MAKE IT A ROCKET / Missile ^^
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> GOD SPEED LITTLE KERBAL
<MirrorImage> not for long it isn't...
<Ta_Dikin> Junp!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> GOD SPEED
<otakon> inb4 only 1 km up
*SpadeKyurem[WoW] salutes
<discslash> oh shi dis goin to be gud
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: why not try an A-10 Warthog design?
<Phase4> 00,02now land it :>
<sub06905> ^
<Arcium> yay
<ouo> i think he's ded
<Java> turn the engine back on again?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Where did the thruster go>
<Buytoast> You got this.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, one way or another this will be on the ground
<MirrorImage> Sumica - make it a helicopter
<Arcium> yes you kan
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I went to go get a drink and i find one engine gone, DA FAUCK HAPENED
<otakon> OH SHIT
<texasboykc09> and dead kerbal
<otakon> RPG MAKER V ACE
<Drew> I keep earing yay o.o
<Drew> hearing*
<Java> what with that?
<otakon> too bad it's 70 bucks -_-
<MirrorImage> or not...
<Arcium> Angle aand opisite rudder at same time
<Phase4> 00,02problem solved!
<texasboykc09> rip kerbal
<Phase4> 00,02planes balanced again
<ouo> boom
<Ta_Dikin> Yay
<Java> jump!
<texasboykc09> splash
<[]DeadpoolDash> make it a jackal, jackal, jackal!
<Arcium> there you go
<MirrorImage> *sploosh*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HE DIED A HERO
<Ta_Dikin> Splosh
<Java> try crash land.... nvm
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> GOD SPEED KERBAL #46745
<texasboykc09> big plane little splash
<Arcium> less speed this time?
<otakon> MORE ROCKETS!
<MirrorImage> nah, more rockets
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MORE SPEED
<MirrorImage> make sure the landing gear has clearance
<Java> this is not going to end well
<otakon> ALL OF THE ENGINES
<Ta_Dikin> yay
<discslash> the engines as been doubled!
<otakon> Java: no it's gonna end KABOOM!
<otakon> :3
<texasboykc09> ^^
<Java> XD
<Phase4> 00,02it'll be a close shave with that lading gear
<MirrorImage> put the landing gear on the rockets?
<[]DeadpoolDash> double thrust, double the fun
<Arcium> the extra trust will make it more unstable :(
<ouo> 6_9
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: fuck landing gear
<ouo> http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/068/7/b/i_just_don__t_know_what_went_wrong__derpy_wp_by_rochambo-d4s9pb9.png
<MirrorImage> needs to be a ramp at the end of the runway
<otakon> Sumica: aye, a ramp
<NocturnalBlade> ouo: exactly lol
<Arcium> yay
<sub06905> its times like these you need ductape
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02nice takeoff
<texasboykc09> ^
<MirrorImage> not like they needed that grass there anyways
<Arcium> MISILE!
<Phase4> 00,02not sure how the intakes will behave with the extra drai
<Phase4> 00,02drain;
<ouo> i thought tail just cut off
<MirrorImage> "Well it does seem slightly more stabl.... nevermind"
<Phase4> 00,02i need to work more with spaceplanes
<otakon> oh crap
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WELP
<otakon> Sumica: BIGGER WINGS MAN
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02dat speed
<Arcium> i would recomend a smaller engine
<otakon> and the tail goes flying off in 3
<otakon> 2
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Whats the speed?
<otakon> 1
<Ta_Dikin> Yay~
<NocturnalBlade> daaaaaamn
<otakon> HOLY HELL
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, air resistance doesnt scale right yet
<Ta_Dikin> sonic rainboom!
<texasboykc09> lol
<MirrorImage> SQUIRREL
<Buytoast> The end must come.
<otakon> Sumica: bigger wings dammit
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I cant read the speedomiter
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: it's that thing in the top middle
<Phase4> 00,02the sas tend to work really well in this version
<Phase4> 00,02also you need a rudder :P
<MirrorImage> so... nose-dive into rainboom?
<RoboGerbil> we dont need control, just do barrel rolls
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> GOTTA GO FAST
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> FASTER FASTER
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> OH SHIT
<otakon> dammit my stream went dark
<Phase4> 00,02flame out

<SpeccyRush> come on sumi you can straighten her out
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: YOU BROKE REALITY
<ouo> how tailplane can handle this airstrem from engines?
<texasboykc09> lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HOW IS THE SHIP STILL IN ONE PIECE
<Kurra> spinning ninja reentry!

<otakon> dammit my stream froze
<texasboykc09> hello geeeky
<discslash> refresh
<MirrorImage> so point it straight down and engage all rockets. lets see what the top speed of this thing is
<texasboykc09> geeky
<geeky> texasboykc09:
<Kurra> I'm gonna need those gimbal angles Jim! BEFORE YOU SHUT DOWN THE LEM
<MirrorImage> no, it isn't
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, its the static one :P
<Ta_Dikin> Sonic Rainboom?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: when you get control, AIM STRAIGHT DOWN
<MirrorImage> you have pitch and roll, but no yaw

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> >One piece touches water, > whole ship explodes, wut
<Arcium> use one engine
<Kurra> Moar conrol surfaces!
<MirrorImage> Arcium - i think you misspelled "ten"
<geeky> needs more eggs
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> needs more sand
<PonyNegZero> not enough vespine gas
<magmablock> Neat

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai geeky
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MORE WINGS
<magmablock> it*
*geeky licks AdamTheDuck
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, it gives you more space to mount engines
<Java> and missiles
<Phase4> 00,02XD, yeah, they do have to fix that
<otakon> Sumica: YOU MUST!
<MirrorImage> a bird?
<NocturnalBlade> ohai geeky ^_^
<Java> a Superman?
<geeky> alo NocturnalBlade
<geeky> who is streaming
<[]DeadpoolDash> airfoils dont really matter in space
<texasboykc09> geeky: Sumica
<geeky> texasboykc09: thanks mate
<Arcium> http://otis.grc.nasa.gov/images/trajectory_optimization_problem.jpg
<MirrorImage> []DeadpoolDash - neither do air/fuel engines, yet here we are
<Arcium> may ansver your questions
<geeky> Arcium: HISSS lerning
<Phase4> 00,02i've got some old ideas i should retry now with the new symetry
<geeky> Sumica: you need to put on more eggs
<[]DeadpoolDash> needs moar gun
<geeky> egg
<SpeccyRush> inb4 to heavy
<Arcium> Â¨to much enines makes the craft too unstable
<[]DeadpoolDash> moar dakka dakka
<MirrorImage> taking bets on how long to crash landing
<magmablock> Murrican Eaglehawk, away!
<[]DeadpoolDash> lolz
<Java> hahahahahahah
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MURICA FUCK YEA
<Ta_Dikin> Lolololololol
<urquix> hahahahahahaha
<Phase4> 00,02they went to space without you
<Arcium> ^murica quality!
<geeky> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: COMIN ALONG TO SAVE THE MUDER FUCKING DAY YAH
<MirrorImage> turn around and go find them?
<ouo> yeah that how you finding useless parts
<[]DeadpoolDash> drag is going to kill those wings
<SpeccyRush> it does look like a bird
<magmablock> I wasn't watching, what broke off?
<MirrorImage> ./r "Ride of the Valkyries"
<geeky> SpeccyRush: you look like a bird <_<
<Arcium> jup
<[]DeadpoolDash> the leading edges broke off
<Java> oh that movie XD
<Ta_Dikin> Yay~
<magmablock> :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sounds like Corneria music
<otakon> CORNERIA!
<Buytoast> Is anyone else hearing a small squeaking sound?
<otakon> GO FOX!
<[]DeadpoolDash> its like a pretty bird
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> TO METEOS
<magmablock> I like swords
<Arcium> highspeed missile with lowspeed'n stress wings O.O
<otakon> Sumica: you are flapping
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Not so fast StarSumica!
<otakon> XD
<Phase4> 00,02uh oh
<[]DeadpoolDash> behold the mighty Seagull!
<otakon> look at that Kerbal
<Phase4> 00,02need to level out faster
<otakon> he's TERRIFIED
<Phase4> 00,02too late
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SHIT
<Phase4> 00,02oh dear
<magmablock> oops
<MirrorImage> doh
<otakon> oh shite
<Sumica> 00,10no air to turn in
<otakon> oh no
<Phase4> 00,02DO A BARRELL ROLL
<otakon> AND GOD
<MirrorImage> quick! spin it the other way! maybe you can make it balance out!
<Java> one winged angel
<magmablock> Good luck landing that thing
<otakon> EJECT STAR SUMICA EJECT!
<MirrorImage> also, i wasn't aware Kerbals were Korean...
<Phase4> 00,02maybe if you spin more, you can make the ither wing fly off and land using the tailplane
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> How has the other wing not ripped off?
<magmablock> Flip it so that the wing serves as a fin and just wing it from there. Pun intended.
<Arcium> And thats whats happens kids when you use low speed and stress wings on a fastflying rocket!
<discslash> the horror, the horror!!
<NocturnalBlade> i come back and Sumica is spinning out of control and missing a wing :D
<Phase4> 00,02SpadeKyurem[WoW], "kerbals"
<geeky> that looks fun
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<texasboykc09> NocturnalBlade: me too
<[]DeadpoolDash> boomerang come back
<Arcium> Sumica: try one engine
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> 'HOW
<Java> on the bright side all 4 engines work well
<Ta_Dikin> How
<geeky> AdamTheDuck: so how are you mate
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> FIRE ALL ENGINES
<SpeccyRush> wobble when you spin Sumica get that other wing off
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DO IT
<PonyNegZero> inb4 reattach

<geeky> AdamTheDuck: awesome =3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Now where is the craft>
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Find it
<discslash> this song gave me nightmares ;~;
<MirrorImage> needs more duct tape
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ductape fixes everything
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If it doesnt you;re doing it wrong
<Ta_Dikin> if ductape does not fix your not using enough!
<SpeccyRush> needs some Slamvender Town
<Java> *cough cough*
<[]DeadpoolDash> mother of god
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> OSSAKUMAN!
<geeky> MEGA MAN

<MirrorImage> this will not end well...;
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Wrek
<[]DeadpoolDash> so much flexing
<discslash> hi wrek
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> How the fuck are we getting funding for this?
<Phase4> 00,02i think you need more duct tape
<Arcium> to much stress on wings! FLY SLOWER!
<magmablock> Butterfly
<texasboykc09> agreed Phase4
<geeky> add my old foe
<NocturnalBlade> morning Wrek ^_^
<discslash> its a pegasus floping
<texasboykc09> how was you night sleep Wrek
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: if you can see the actual wing, there isn't enough duct tape?
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02i've actually had so many struts that it hid a stage once
<Ta_Dikin> now it stays togarther
<Phase4> 00,02my graphics card was not fond of that craft
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ok bets on it ripping to shreds>
<Arcium> 8-bit MLP!

<Ta_Dikin> sonic rainboom?
<Phase4> 00,02lol, nicely timed
<Wrek> 05i am considering farcry 3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SPARKS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> BOOM
<Phase4> 00,02not enough intakes
<Arcium> use less engine powah!
<pony_4908> DED
<Ta_Dikin> Yay~
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What keeps exploding?
<[]DeadpoolDash> how is it not breaking up?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So are we fucked?
<Phase4> 00,02[]DeadpoolDash, sufficent duct tape
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHY IS THE KERBAL SMILING
<Wrek> 05anyone got a selling point for it?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HOW CAN HE ENJOY THIS
<Java> madness set in
<Ta_Dikin> Winter wrap up, winter wrap up!
<discslash> believe me this kerbal is never able to see the winter again
<Phase4> 00,02if you sit at 13-15KM up you could probably cross the ocean
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> FIGHTTHE INVISIBLE
<[]DeadpoolDash> what kind of engines are those?
<Phase4> 00,02returning to ksp?
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, a lot better than Far Cry 2 apparently
<Phase4> 00,02[]DeadpoolDash, jet
*AdamTheDuck shivers at the boredom that came from Far Cry 2
<Ta_Dikin> Derp :P
<pony_4908> Stahp
<[]DeadpoolDash> do they have ramjets and scramjets in the game?
*geeky puts a soft blakit on AdamTheDuck
<Phase4> 00,02ok, hypothetically you could sit at altitude and cross the ocean
<Ta_Dikin> barrol roll!
<Phase4> 00,02in practice though
<Arcium> those engines looks like d....... :ifyouknowwhatimean:
<sub06905> Phase4: you should build that ship that was able through glide through the air
<Ta_Dikin> Hahaha
<sub06905> when ever you play ksp that is
<sub06905> :P
<Phase4> 00,02sub06905, the infinite energy one? i should try that actually
<Phase4> 00,02would work differently in 0.18
<Phase4> 00,02its still in the game
<sub06905> Phase4: yes that one :$
<Phase4> 00,02they've not changed the air physics all that much
<[]DeadpoolDash> carmen sandiego
<sub06905> looks like sumi might actually survive
<Phase4> 00,02not only survive, i think sumi could land this
<pony_4908> Oh my.
<Phase4> 00,02it'll be a heck of alanding
<[]DeadpoolDash> land it...with a crash
<Kinixys> Hey the Kerbal is happy.
<geeky> it upside down
<Phase4> 00,02the pilot looks happy
<SpeccyRush> he's high as a kite
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, thats part of the aerodynamics change, planes can go much further now
<sub06905> come on sumi you can land this
<Ta_Dikin> ^

<Phase4> 00,02SpadeKyurem[WoW], him too
<Alzarath> So who thinks the past few episodes have had too much fanservice?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MOAR ROCKETS
<Shizuka> 13too much?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If I was building this thing It would be coated in fucking rockets
<Java> so many duct tapes....
<Shizuka> 13you can never have too much SABISU SABISU
<Ta_Dikin> naww
<J_E_Smith71> Thank God Bronystate has the no spoiler rule, with the ep leaked I'm steering clear of it until Saturday like a normal person. At least I don't have to worry about talk of it popping up here
<J_E_Smith71> I hope the leak doesn't cause a loss in viewers though
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> J_E_Smith71: There's always one idiot
<Shizuka> 13oh i'm sure talk will pop up
<Alzarath> Oh Celestia, the new ep is leaked?
<Shizuka> 13and so will a banhammer
<Kinixys> Alzarath: The duel was. Sleepless wasn't really that much fanservice.
<Guest18749> Ehehe....

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: You meant to do that right?
<discslash> oh what
<Ta_Dikin> to the moon!!!!!
<J_E_Smith71> Alzarath: According to EqD yes, but I'm not looking for it. Gonna wait till Saturday
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ta_Dikin: Moo~
<Ta_Dikin> Moo~

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> We're boned
<geeky> kabom
<J_E_Smith71> Kinixys: Apartment inspection
<pony_4908> Who needs 'em?
<Kinixys> Tosses the engines like grenades.
<Alzarath> I'd just like it if they toned down a little.
<Phase4> 00,02engine v engine
<Java> bye engine
<Phase4> 00,02engine wins
<sub06905> lel
*SuperBrony64 is petted ^-^

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So how long till we die?
*SuperBrony64 boops Havok :3
<Alzarath> All of us collectively? When was doomsday?
<Havok> ^.^
<Kinixys> J_E_Smith71: Oh lovely.
<Phase4> 00,02now try land msising one of the landing gear
<Java> Engines: "Screw you guys I'm outta here"
<discslash> like a star wars
<sub06905> flap dem wings!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The engines are gonna make their own game
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> With blackjack and hookers
<AppleBloom> Engies: I'm gonna build my own plane, with blackjack and hookers.
<Havok> The kerbal looks terrified
<Havok> xD
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You know what forget the blackjack
<J_E_Smith71> Kinixys: Yeah I know, and like I said they only gave me one day's notice this time. Even lovelier
<AppleBloom> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: lol you beat me to it
<Ta_Dikin> sweetie belle is best cow!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HOW ARE WE STILL ALIVE
<Kinixys> J_E_Smith71: So they just want to give their tenents a hard time?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> THIS THING IS NOT OSHA SAFE
<Java> dumb luck?
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/nHi2R.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, if you close the intakes it reduces drag
<Ta_Dikin> land it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> the fuck is that bit on the engine?
<sub06905> kittehs <3
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Saturn.
<J_E_Smith71> Kinixys: They do the inspections every now and then but usually they inform us weeks in advance
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You lost a wheel
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> NOW THINGS GET INTETESTING
<Havok> xD
<Ta_Dikin> land it
<AppleBloom> nailed it
<pony_4908> Hey look, a wheel.
<Phase4> 00,02Success
<Havok> He survived xD
<sub06905> :D
<J_E_Smith71> Kinixys: What's even worse is that they posted it this afternoon, so I didn't see it until I came home this evening
<Ta_Dikin> yay~
<PonyNegZero> perfect landing, again!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> RIDE IT LIKE A UNICYCLE
<pony_4908> *wheel retracts
<Ta_Dikin> Moo~
<Havok> rofl
<pony_4908> Possessed?
<Kinixys> Alzarath: I dunno. Just putting Luna in an episode doesn't automatically make it fanservice.
<discslash> to the base!!
<PonyNegZero> inb4 unexpected 'splosion...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Are 90% of these survivals dumb luck?
<Phase4> 00,02i like to imagine that this is how they retrive pods on kerbin
<sub06905> nope all skill~
<sub06905> :I
<Phase4> 00,02they have them roll all the way home
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> <_<
<Kinixys> J_E_Smith71: Well, hopefully it won't have you up all night.
<Alzarath> Making her control the unconscious realm and be able to control ponies fears might. Then the obvious Scootaloo thing.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: Try to build a craft with nothing but engines
<J_E_Smith71> Kinixys: It's already 2 AM here:p
<Havok> Looks, okay. Time to fly it
<pony_4908> Is this the paid version of the game or the free demo? :O
<Kinixys> J_E_Smith71: Same here!
<Chrysalis> if you attatch engines to both sides
<sub06905> paid
<Chrysalis> can you crush the cockpit
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Alzarath: You're clearly reading too much into this
<Phase4> 00,02i see where this is going
<Alzarath> Always, SpadeKyurem[WoW]. But reading too into things is fun.
<Chrysalis> ahh Mica stream
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHEEL BOT
<Chrysalis> best 7am wake up music
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> YES
<Kinixys> Alzarath: She controls fears?
<Phase4> also i feel like turning colour off
<PonyNegZero> that Phase4 is a spy!
<sub06905> nekkid Phase4
<Shizuka> 13i guess you could say
<PonyNegZero> he's posing as a regular
<Shizuka> 13you're going through your naked phase :P
<Alzarath> She can basically control any emotion through ponies dreams, Kinixys.
<Phase4> PonyNegZero, i think not!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So is Luna Freddy now?
<geeky> needs more eegs
<sub06905> Shizuka: :D
<Phase4> Shizuka, XDF

<Havok> I like where this is going
<XAX> would anyone like me to slip them a link to the new episode under the table?
<XAX> lol
<AppleBloom> so what's the name of this game?
*SpadeKyurem[WoW] shoots XAX
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> No
<XAX> ok
<XAX> ded
<Kinixys> Alzarath: I'll have to watch it again cause I missed the whole bit about her creating everyone's dreams for them.
<XAX> ill go back to brack flops 2 now
<Chrysalis> dear kerbals
<Chrysalis> for what we are about to see
<Ta_Dikin> Lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Kinixys: He's clearly reading far too much into this
<Chrysalis> we are eternally grateful
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So who's going to break the news to the wives of all the kerbals we slaughtered?
<Phase4> Sumica, could copy it into the vab and do the radial symetry there
<Havok> omg

<Havok> I never thought of that xD
<PonyNegZero> Havok: you've never known that?

<Buytoast> you wont be able to get the last stragglers
<Phase4> Chrysalis, nah, just cant use radil symetry in the spaceplane hanger
<PonyNegZero> it is, but I'm surprised that nobody knew that...

<Saturn> 08,01and the voice
<Saturn> 08,01and the little crowny thingy
<Saturn> 08,01and the wings
<Saturn> 08,01and maybe just everything, actualy
<AdamTheDuck> and everything while you're at it Saturn :$
<AdamTheDuck> aww you beat me to it :P
<PonyNegZero> Saturn~
<RoboGerbil> chrysalis can be any pony too
<PonyNegZero> ehh... it is past 5am, I won't worry about a photospam on you....
<Saturn> 08,01true; she can be a stallion too... >.>

<PonyNegZero> poor Saturn, reading day is today for me~
<Saturn> 08,01so i have to be able to convert java to jvm bytecode in my head
<AJIsAwesome> Ouch. .__.
<Saturn> 08,01it's okay, though; i'm well prepared
<PonyNegZero> java... would drinking coffee help?
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm quite good at the bytecode thing
<ouo> chrysalis look cheese
<RoboGerbil> who uses java anymore anyway? html5
<Saturn> 08,01RoboGerbil: java is widely used pretty much everywhere
<RoboGerbil> but... html5
<Saturn> 08,01RoboGerbil: the two aren't even comparable.
<Saturn> 08,01they're for different purposes
<ouo> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/210/9/b/adventures_in_foal_sitting_by_viraljp-d58zuwm.png

<ouo> or maybe that space
<Saturn> 08,01i'm pretty much peaking in my knowledge of it; i'll forget it all after my exam, most likeyl

<Java> The Lizard?
<pony_2037> oh wow
<Java> Spiderman enemy?
<djblazekin> imagine if twilight did the mirorr pond cloning she'd probably become smarter than celestia and probably take over
<Spectre> All I heard from that was Venom is badass
<Java> Smarter? probably. wiser? no
<Java> Twilight = nervous wreck when there's lack of order
<AJIsAwesome> Wiser, of course not. Smarter? Probably not.

<Spectre> Mario is more original
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hey SuperBrony64 i got a message for you
<Java> Sonic is original too!
<AJIsAwesome> djblazekin: She wouldn't be able to handle it, in my opinion.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I just pulled together a bunch of common, foil, tattoo, and standee cards of the MLP TCG to give to my cousin who likes the show :)

<Spectre> But it didn't get popular untill Mario was around
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Or probably the first cave man who decided to throw a ball at someone else.
<Java> Smashing dirt with club is what start gaming
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<Spectre> True
<djblazekin> no technicly it was spacewar a mit super computer exclusive
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I could give the big history of gaming...but it would be so long~
<aniderp|bestcakeever> super nes started my gaming
<Spectre> Dito
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i think it was the super nes
<Java> Sega Genesis started my gaming
<AJIsAwesome> NES started my gaming. :)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> duck hunt.. wheel of fortune
<aniderp|bestcakeever> that sound like super nes?
<AJIsAwesome> aniderp|bestcakeever: NES. :)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh
<Java> Golden Axe, Power Ranger...
<djblazekin> my first game was mario at 1 yo
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But basically, a bunch of Game companies died off in 1983 when the big depression of gaming started. It wasn't until 1985 that Nintendo came along and fixed it.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> then the nes started mine
<Spectre> Snes - Sega - xbox - gamecube - xbox 360 and Wi
<Spectre> *Wii
<Java> I'm a Sega fanboy who surrounded by Nintendo fanboy T_T
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i was like 3 when i started playing

<SuperBrony64> 11,02I got REZ HD on my 360~
<AJIsAwesome> REZ? What's that?
<Java> Oh why Sega have to fall
<aniderp|bestcakeever> remember when you blew across the game?
<Java> REZ is a game your girlfriend will love too
<aniderp|bestcakeever> to have it work properly?
<Java> As long you bought the vibrating add on
<AJIsAwesome> Wouldn't that ruin the game?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> idk o.o
<djblazekin> i actually started with a ps1 and a game boy then a ps2 with gba then wii and psp with ds now ps3, 360 and wii with psv and 3ds xl
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but people always did that..
<Spectre> The only RE I want to know and be a huge fan of is Resident Evil
<AJIsAwesome> I hear RE4 is great.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> buys zelda for a crush.. starts dating then marry
<aniderp|bestcakeever> xD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well 5:40 seems a good time to sleep, Night everyone
<Spectre> RE4 was a very good game but I just despised Leon
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. :)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> gives the girl her zelda.. hopes she likes girls also.. if so she dates me then maybe marriage
<djblazekin> re4 and revelations are good but 5 and 6 meh
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you think it would be that easy?
<Spectre> RE 5 I thought was soso RE 6 was badass
<AJIsAwesome> aniderp|bestcakeever: Depends on the people and the relationship.
*aniderp|bestcakeever needs to find herself a gf with common intrests
<djblazekin> my gf diggs cod l4d and re and persona
<Spectre> All of the above are epic except for COD
<AJIsAwesome> I like cod. It's a good tasting fish.
<djblazekin> oh and the project diva games miku for the win
<Spectre> You know what I despise COD as a fish and as a game
<djblazekin> i play a bit of everything from cod to re to beatmania and dance central and ddr to gta and final fantasy and starcraft
<AJIsAwesome> So you wouldn't want a game themed after a fish? :<
<Spectre> I bet you didn't play Dead Rising though
<Spectre> No because seafood tastes horrible all around
<AJIsAwesome> Not to me. I love seafood.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I hate shrimp. :I
<Wrek> 05i love most kinds of food
<Wrek> 05overall

<Arcium> its horrible
<Wrek> 05Arcium: that talking about it in here is forbidden and i dont give a fuck if its leaked or not
<Spectre> That is honestly crazy I thought I was the only one who liked the DR series everyone always bitches and complains of how terrible the games are
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the future comes one day at a time

<Java> Liz Taylor, not the best example
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Yep. XD
<Spectre> DR is not ripping off Dawn of the dead damn it they even say they aren't ripping off the movie, the movie sucked anyways

<RoboGerbil> ouo: you should look at your partner, its prolly your problem
<ouo> :D
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I was saying that I was kidding.
<Alchemist> hi guys
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Alchemist. :)
<Ponies47> Hey Alchemist
<valoreins> ohai Alchemist :)
<Alchemist> whats with the 18+ stream? O.O
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Older audienced themed show. :)
<Wrek> 05coverign my own ass Alchemist
<AJIsAwesome> *audience
<Wrek> 05nothing else
<ouo> hai
<XAX> Wrek: Is it there because you know /someone/ will complain about the stream content, and you've got it there to say they were warned?
<Alchemist> Wrek: I suspected as much I just didnt know what show this was. Now I hear Penn's voice :D
<Ponies47> o.o
<AJIsAwesome> .....
<Soulless_DCLXVI> That was bad...
<Ponies47> Now I see why we got the 18+ sign.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Actually, it went up when strippers first made an appearance.
<Wrek> 05Soulless_DCLXVI: yeah forgot to tick it on when i started with this show
<Alchemist> strippers shouldnt be 18+ material.
<Alchemist> I see tv commercials which are more hardcore.
<Wrek> 05you wouldnt want anotehr month of nothingness though rite?
<Wrek> 05:P
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Still, better to have your ass covered.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> ^
<Ponies47> Indeed Wrek
<Alchemist> Wrek: you are absolutely right, Im just saying that the rating system (18+, 16+ etc) is so inconsistent in the western world.
<Wrek> 05heck
<Wrek> 05you amurikans dont know whats best for ya :P
<MadSurge> Well fuck, it looks like I can't stay here today :| mom is sending me to get a haircut all of a sudden
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, what is a stripper, but a woman who has no skill other than lowering herself to a mindless sex-object, just a target for mens' lust.
<Kandarihu> ?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Really? What about tacos? Are tacos best for me? If not, than you may be right.
<MadSurge> Might as well go there when I'm bald next time
<Alchemist> oh wow, am I reading this right? Live Andrea Libman stream after the ep this saturday? Awesome.
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, yes you are.
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: a bit rhetorical but sounds about right.
<[]DeadpoolDash> which chat we she be watching, bronystate or celestia radio?
<[]DeadpoolDash> will
<AJIsAwesome> Either one.
<[]DeadpoolDash> last time I was on celestia radio they were posting pron links there
<valoreins> haven't ate pizzas for months
<valoreins> no, years

<Ponies47> O.O
<Wrek> 05marketing 101
<ouo> i've seen a few shows with this guys, but never saw that
<Alchemist> Wrek: and egoism, the feel that I am superior to anyone.
<ouo> Wrek, capitalism ho!
<Kandarihu> Wrek, that's what you said that Game of Thrones is made of, right?
<ouo> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6k37s2PaA1r96br0o1_500.png
<Wrek> 05more or less
<Wrek> 05albeit its lackign in cooking
<Kandarihu> And yet we're all huge fans of a cartoon that has only a little bit of cooking and much less of the others.
<Wrek> 05why not jsut rebuild the towers?
<Wrek> 05that should be the biggest fuck you to the oens that did it
<[]DeadpoolDash> ^
<ouo> 'ground zero... so this is where the first guy got aids'
<Ponies47> ...
<[]DeadpoolDash> rebuild them, bigger and better, faster, stronger
<Kandarihu> Wrek, Development Hell. Also, apparently the Chinese are financing it now. So they can't call it the Freedom Tower anymore.
<Java> Mao tower?
<SpeccyRush> Wrek: thank you, go been saying that since middle school everyone thought it was stupid, if only they weren't idoits
<valoreins> made in china tower
<Kandarihu> Java, One Trade Center

<Bronysith> do you speak it?
<Java> GOG has Duke Nukem 1 and 2
<Java> side scrolling
<djblazekin> yes
<Java> better than the FPS version
<Bronysith> gog is a wonderful place
<Bronysith> i got baldurs gate 1 and 2, planescape torment for 5 dollars
<ouo> god i need subtitle or rewatch this show...
<Bronysith> too bad those games are shit
<Java> GOG already starting their sales

<Arcium> Kandarihu , that and: time left, temperature, and also a timer so we can set it to make toast in the morning, its also a firealarm :D
<Java> Are you a lady?
<Java> yes
<ouo> not that sexy ._.
<ouo> <_<
<Bronysith> mmmm sexy ponies
<Kandarihu> Arcium, awesome.
<Alchemist> polygraph sounds like bs
<ouo> PONIES ARE SEXY?!
<ouo> next question
<Bronysith> Alchemist: it really is
<Arcium> meybe
<Arcium> ouo : YOU KNOW TO MUCH
<Alchemist> Bronysith: is polygraph testing still considered to be evidence in court?
<ouo> actually they need do shoot that quistion on man before and after watching mlp
<Bronysith> Alchemist: ill ask my friend whos in forensics
<ouo> pretty sure reaction wouldn't be same

<Bronysith> lex luthor
<ouo> he is so excitied
<[]DeadpoolDash> strippers...they strip
<Alchemist> []DeadpoolDash: yeah, they strip you of your money
<Java> SPAH
<Sun> hello
<[]DeadpoolDash> unless you stay in the second row
<[]DeadpoolDash> and buy the 1 drink mininum
<Alchemist> []DeadpoolDash: that sounds so sad. :D
<[]DeadpoolDash> going to a strip club is kind of sad
<djblazekin> lie detecters are bs
<Rose`> really
<Rose`> i agree []DeadpoolDash.
<djblazekin> greate example in viva la bam
<Alchemist> I've been to one once. Wasnt that great...
<Alchemist> Its full of douches with baggage.
<Alchemist> Even more so than regular clubs.
<[]DeadpoolDash> strip clubs are hubs for broken dreams, the strippers and the patrons
<Dark92Enigma> Agree []DeadpoolDash
<Bronysith> 48 life sentences?
<Alchemist> okay, now thats just depressing :D
<Depressing_Rain> it is ins't it
<ouo> sooo... maybe he's innocent
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I believe a life sentence is 30 years.
<Alchemist> its 25 here
<Dark92Enigma> []DeadpoolDash: even though i've never been to one, i just watched it from TV
<Dark92Enigma> EVER
<Bronysith> its true
*ouo prepared
<Depressing_Rain> how did pen know
<Dark92Enigma> Inb4 all of the AJ smileys
<ouo> lawl
<Dark92Enigma> 1-800-555-ANAL
<ouo> anus jokes hhaha
<Bronysith> it hurts to clench
*ouo prepared anus
<Bronysith> intelligent asshole?
*Bronysith looks at his ass "are you smart?" "...."
<Dark92Enigma> GOOOOOLDBEEEEERG
*Bronysith pulls out a riding crop "time to punish your ass"
*Dark92Enigma looks at his ass too
*Bronysith spanks himself with the riding crop
<Alchemist> are you enjoying yourself Bronysith ? :D
<Kandarihu> Hmm, if that trick can be spotted, the jig is up.
<Bronysith> caviar is overrated
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Oi this is no such place for that :D
<ouo> oh man so doomed
<ouo> lawl
<Alchemist> Asking "I did good?" is not a good sign after a polygraph test.
<[]DeadpoolDash> lap dance isnt sexual
<ouo> STOP PLAYING WITH ANUS!
<Bronysith> why must everything in P And teller be sexual Wrek ?
<djblazekin> i'm going to bed everyone later
<Dark92Enigma> GOOD COP BAD COP
<Alchemist> bye djblazekin !
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, djblazekin.

*Bronysith takes valoreins to bed
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: because......comedic relief?
<valoreins> oh... my..
<Dark92Enigma> bye djblazekin
<Kandarihu> If I were to try to deceive a polygraph machine, I think I have other ways other than this, which might not be so easily detected.
<Bronysith> PICARD XD
<djblazekin> if you could teleport to my house valoreins
<Dark92Enigma> PICARD! :D
<Depressing_Rain> I have to go, bye everypony

<ouo> he just an idiot
<ouo> y he keep telling him things?!
<Alchemist> these guys who say "just a kiss, just some fondlign etc is not cheating" think its not cheating if your d*ck is only half way in either.
<[]DeadpoolDash> what a douchebag
<[]DeadpoolDash> he didnt have sex though
*aniderp|bestcakeever collaspes on ground
<Dark92Enigma> BULLS**T

<Alchemist> I can tell Penn had a ball with this show :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i dont see the stream btw
*RoboGerbil likes that blone
<RoboGerbil> blonde*
<ouo> bullshed
<[]DeadpoolDash> lolz
*Bronysith grabs Wrek and blasts off
<Kandarihu> aniderp|bestcakeever, the nice thing about having an external IRC client is that I can move it over the stream when something that I personally don't want to see and don't have to comes up.
<pony_8724> SUNE!
<Dark92Enigma> ummm what the hell am i doing in the bed?
<Kandarihu> I did that all the time during my pony fast
<pony_8724> Arcium!

<Kandarihu> Alchemist, oh, you're right.

<pony_8724> THEY TOOK ERR JERBS
<Dark92Enigma> bye aniderp|bestcakeever
<ouo> i need to go home but i can't stop watching the stream
<ouo> damnit Wrek!
<Dark92Enigma> Nowadays, videogames have to be COVERED in blodd to sell (most of them)
<pony_9768> ;)>_>
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, try telling that to .notch
<Java> Heh Hillary
<Dark92Enigma> but DOES THIS MAKE US VIOLENT? I don't think so
<spypengen> BOOOOOOO!!!!
<Java> hahahahha
<Java> BARRED!
<spypengen> YAY!!!!!!!
<ouo> and James Rolfe
<Dark92Enigma> personally, i don't think videogames make us violent
<Kandarihu> Is this going to be completely focused on one genre? I mean, I don't mind FPS games, but I play other genres.
<[]DeadpoolDash> AR-15s are pretty easy to handle
<Dark92Enigma> THE THREE STOOGES :D
<SpeccyRush> ah
<SpeccyRush> this one
<Java> American = FPS
<ouo> nope videogames just timekiller, as anything else
<pony_8724> ER MAR FURCKING GERDH
<Dark92Enigma> Ummmm no TF2?
<ouo> it's fun and everything, over people do us violent :)
<ouo> fuk eah
<[]DeadpoolDash> tf2 is cartoony so they probably didnt include it
<ouo> ded
<[]DeadpoolDash> is he playing a ps2?
<ouo> stream just <put sunglasses> got wreked
<spypengen> BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
<Java> Now barred :p
<[]DeadpoolDash> wow...polio
<ouo> bullshed
<Kandarihu> This is before Jack Thompson was disbarred, right?
<Java> yep
<[]DeadpoolDash> wii
<ouo> lol he is?
<ouo> good to know
<spypengen> YAY!!!
<ouo> fun!
<killerpony7733> Dat quake 4
<ouo> fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
<ouo> then i was growing nobody it was happy years of blood and doom
<Kandarihu> Even though the "murder simulator" stigma has been debunked, there's still a backlash against video games. Now the stigma can be summed up as "digital narcotic"
<ouo> gaben
<Kandarihu> Eeyup. This is entirely focused on a single genre.
<ouo> dissapruve
<ouo> asshole
<Java> This TV show is pretty biased....
<ouo> yes.. COD players pretty violent
<Alchemist> what kind of asshole is this?
<Java> FPS all the way
<ouo> cus they kids, and playing boring games
<KrazyNoobs> Is this "Bu--sh-t"
<Dark92Enigma> KrazyNoobs: Eeeeyup
<ouo> hai, KrazyNoobs :)
<[]DeadpoolDash> I kind committed genocide in games, but that doesn't mean I'm going to do that for real.
<ouo> indeed
<[]DeadpoolDash> have
<KrazyNoobs> I started playing COD when I was 14, but that is old now... I only play TF2 now at 17. btw, hi ouo
<Alchemist> she is talking about addiction, and not about games turning kids violent
<valoreins> i never played COD, is that good in some way?
<Alchemist> SCIENCE
<Wrek> 05stay away from cod
<Wrek> 05tuna is better
<AJIsAwesome> valoreins: I hear the early games were good. I was never really into it.
<ouo> he did science lol
<KrazyNoobs> To tell the truth, I hate those 7 - 13 year olds that play violent video games...
<Java> simpleton cod
<pony_7250> a bug XD
<Java> sod
<[]DeadpoolDash> troubled kid is the primary reason there
<AJIsAwesome> But I like cod. It's a pretty good-tasting fish. :<
<Java> simpleton sod with simpleton science
<KrazyNoobs> Valoreins For a young kid, COD is good, but it really isn't anything special. TF2 is actually good
<ouo> it was ok
<ouo> before it became mainstream
<Kandarihu> You know, I do like the scenario-based FPSes. The ones where you really have a proper justification for the things you do, killing or otherwise.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<ouo> yeah, cut that kid
<Java> Bill Clinton is a good politician, Hilarry? not so much
<KrazyNoobs> That engineer's a SPY!
<Alchemist> I loved GTA Vice city. am I a psychopath?
<Kandarihu> I remember when I played Timesplitters 2. There was a part where you grab a fire extinguisher to put out fires, and the thing works the SAME WAY as a gun! I just thought that was the most genius thing around.
<ouo> engenier
<SpeccyRush> dem lan parties
<Dark92Enigma> I <3 GTA San Andreas.....do i have issues?
<KrazyNoobs> >
<Wrek> 05actually
<Dark92Enigma> oh
<Wrek> 05a distinct difference between spycopaths and "normal" people
<Alchemist> Dark92Enigma: according to some delusional bitter old people you do.
<KrazyNoobs> o rly?
<Wrek> 05is that if you have a train track, and a train is coming, and if it continues 5 peopel will die. but you can press a button that diverts it to anotehr track, but on that track 1 person will die
<KrazyNoobs> This show is rather entertaining
<Dark92Enigma> Alchemist what credibility do they have?
<Kandarihu> I honestly hope this show goes into Penn's contribution to the industry. The one that Loading Ready Run makes good use of every November.
<Wrek> 05pushign the button would both to normal people and spycopaths be relatively easy
<Wrek> 055 > 1
<Rose`> im a sociopath
<Wrek> 05however
<Wrek> 05if it didnt involve a button
<Wrek> 05but that you had to push someone over the rail
<Alchemist> Dark92Enigma: null. they have good rhetoric though and they prey on easily scared parents.
<Wrek> 05and onto the tracks
<Wrek> 05instead
<Wrek> 05of a button
<ouo> i played that games with trains
<valoreins> and twinkies
<ouo> i have a link
<Wrek> 05a spychopath would do it as easely as pushign the button
<KrazyNoobs> Wrek: When you say that three-letter g-word, do you get kicked by yourself?
<Kandarihu> The thing is, the victims of school shootings ALSO play violent video games.
<ouo> c:
<Wrek> 05wherethars a normal person wouldnt
<Rose`> is there a way to get two trains?
<Alchemist> Wrek: did you watch the bigthink video about it?
<Wrek> 05gak?
<Wrek> 05Alchemist: yeh :P
<Rose`> with a 6 kill streak i just need to shoot somone to get my chopper
<KrazyNoobs> Did you get a paddlin', Wrek?
<Wrek> 05nope
<KrazyNoobs> lol
<Alchemist> Wrek: there is a 3 part lecture of this particular issue on YT (I think Harward lectures) if you are interested.
<Kandarihu> There was an online gaming service in the 1990s that had a tagline "Taking violence on the streets and putting it on the internet." I loved that slogan.
<KrazyNoobs> I shouldn't be proud of this, but I was kick #2000 and #2222... ensuring that happened was a waste of my time, really.
<Kandarihu> R.I.P. Heat.net
<Alchemist> frendchip
<Alchemist> nice spread
<KrazyNoobs> btw, I have a question: If Season 3 Episode 7 was leaked, why would watching it be considered a spoiler, IF IT IS ALREADY OUT in its entirity?
<pony_4053> 2 more days
<ouo> gak is still kick word?
<ouo> yeup
<KrazyNoobs> ouo dat kick
<Dark92Enigma> yes
<killerpony7733> KrazyNoobs Cause it's not officially out?
<Dark92Enigma> it is
<[]DeadpoolDash> police right behind them
<AJIsAwesome> KrazyNoobs: Because it's technically not aired yet on its intended date.
<Alchemist> wasnt it leaked rather than officially released?
<Kandarihu> .......woah. Okay. I... I kinda promised to myself that I wouldn't do links of any kind for a while since that incident last Saturday. I think 24 hours would be enough.
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Leaked.
<KrazyNoobs> killerpony7733 but it is out as a whole, it doesn't need to be "official"... well, that is my opinion though, but before I watched it, I just wanted to ask the question.
<KrazyNoobs> Fine, I won't watch it. I will show respect to the makers by watching it on here.
<Wrek> 05KrazyNoobs: because of one word in that sentence
<Wrek> 05leaked
<KrazyNoobs> Wrek Did you read my comment? The one above yours?
<[]DeadpoolDash> beta c-mag
<KrazyNoobs> I shouldn't watch it, anyway, that is "cheating"
<SpeccyRush> nut job
<SpeccyRush> a hypocritical nut job
<ouo> KrazyNoobs, mee tooo, i'll wait end of week
<KrazyNoobs> ouo I'd rather watch it here, but there will be some trolls that will spoil it for us on the day...
<KrazyNoobs> in the caht
<Arcium> Are bronystate going to stream the official release?
<KrazyNoobs> *chat
<ouo> fuk i sitting at work cus stream doesn't stop
<Kandarihu> I don't see that as hypocritical. He values the 2nd Amendment, because he expects everyone to be using firearms RESPONSIBLY. And he's prejudiced against gamers because he believes that anyone who plays FPSes can't be trusted with a gun.
<Java> That's Ron Jeremy?
<KrazyNoobs> Arcium Yes, they broadcast The Hub, and watch the new episode. Also, there will be a LITTLE surprise during this week's commercial break. The chat will explode
<Arcium> :D
<SpeccyRush> coulda dislocated his damn arm and jaw
<Arcium> KrazyNoobs: do you know when they do it?
<killerpony7733> Wait till the end people
<[]DeadpoolDash> .223 and 5.56 dont kick very hard, he didnt have it shouldered correctly
<Java> I think they use ammo with less gunpowder
<killerpony7733> It gets better
<Java> so it will be less recoil
<pony_4053> there was a famous video of a kid shooting a mac10/uzi set in full auto and it spun around on his finger an killed him
<ouo> KrazyNoobs, how did you know about commercials in new episode?
<Kandarihu> FPS with a touchpad. The horrors
<Wrek> 05.306
<KrazyNoobs> Arcium There is a timer on the home page... 12 hours before the episode will air at 10:00am EST (Middle USA), a timer will show on the livestream page
<Wrek> 05now dats a kicker
<ouo> if you didn't see that
<Arcium> mmkay :D
<[]DeadpoolDash> .308 isnt too bad

<pony_4053> cyber athletic leaguew
<ouo> oh
<KrazyNoobs> ouo They said The Hub will show it again on Dec 14
<Jmo> Wow. You seriously have a problem.
<ouo> what FB?
<Jmo> You need to get over your obsession with that.
<Arcium> Bye :D
<Jmo> It is getting pretty shit.
<pony_4053> football is more dangerous than paintball
<Kandarihu> Also encouraged by parents.
<pony_4053> there only been 2 recorded deaths in paintball
<killerpony7733> Watch this
<killerpony7733> It gets really good now
<ouo> oh i got it
<ouo> 6_9
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo I know, the only reason I am still attached to the squishable stuff is that I am currently working hard on a YTPMV, although I am 4 weeks late... Yeah, I'll also admit it is getting pretty stupid
<SpeccyRush> and here's the twist of the knife
<ouo> silly me
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Jmo> Seriously man. You get on everyday and talk about it.
<Java> what happened with him?
<pony_4053> i got scared to shoot a sks once
<ouo> he just killed someone?
<pony_4053> i pooped me pantalones
<Dark92Enigma> Java: he got traumatized
<Java> oh....
<Kandarihu> Because Football is perfectly normal for guys to gather in front of a TV and drink beer every Sunday, but video games are a "digital narcotic" now.
<valoreins> well i got feels
<[]DeadpoolDash> the gun scared him cause he didnt have it shouldered right
<Dark92Enigma> actually........why the fuck am i laughing?
<ouo> well
<Dark92Enigma> :'(
<pony_4053> they are a narcotic
<Java> Tbh I want to see this show talk about other games than FPS :(
<SpeccyRush> Wrek: please explain to those that don't understand why he was crying
<ouo> i'm going home now
<pony_4053> i played cs since like 99
<pony_4053> it is a drug
<ouo> dare stream i miss something interesting!
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT have i done
<Dark92Enigma> I'VE KILLED THE WABBIT!
<Java> I know they defend video games, but it looks like FPS is the only video game out there
<KrazyNoobs> Jmo Yeah, it is only funny when the ad is actually on... at other times, it can be quite annoying.
<valoreins> why do they always target FPS as violent games? why not roleplaying games? :s
<Dark92Enigma> Poor little wabbit......poor little wabbit :'(
<pony_4053> ultima online was pretty brutal the pking
<Java> FPS = easy target
<Alchemist> you can get addicted to ANYTHING that gives you pleasure. highlighting some of these stuff as narcotics is misleading.
<ouo> i remember blood
<Java> Also FPS = most American play it
<ouo> it was my faforite fps
<[]DeadpoolDash> FPS usually have the most graphic violence
<ouo> but i didn't became a psycho o something
<Dark92Enigma> old intro! :)
<KrazyNoobs> I don't understand Fung Shei either...
<killerpony7733> Wrek Isn't there more then a few of those we have seen of pen and teller so far?
<Java> If violence video game actually make us all psycho I bet the street will be littered with murderous psycopath...
<Java> But no
<Kandarihu> Java, to prove a point about the effects of video games, they actually made a game called Desert Bus that's about driving a bus from Tuscon to Las Vegas and back. It's an eight hour drive and the game runs in REAL TIME! There's no pause, stopping the bus causes the engine to stall, and veering off the road causes the bus to crash.
<Wrek> 05huh?
<[]DeadpoolDash> what?
<Kandarihu> The bus also veers naturally to the right so you have to be intelligently steering the whole eight hours.
<Java> I bet it will cause violence more. All the rage
<valoreins> amusingly i got motivated into a graphic designer because of video games, so graphic design field we'll get many psychopaths
<valoreins> :D
<Java> I'm a graphic designer grad too :p
<Kandarihu> The point of Desert Bus is that the game doesn't make people any better at marathon drivers than FPSes make people more violent.
<Java> murder all the logo!
<[]DeadpoolDash> SCIENCE!!!
<Dark92Enigma> Wrek: someponies didn't get the ending from last episode.......i did, too late :(
*Dark92Enigma dries his tears
<Kandarihu> Every mid-november, Loading Ready Run does a charity event called Desert Bus for Hope that benefits Childs Play
<Java> I'm not Chinese, but as an Asian I have several Chinese friends and they all said that those FengShui "locations" are bullshit. Real one isn't like that.
<KrazyNoobs> STupid "science" is stupid
<JRP2234> wrek did i miss johny?
<valoreins> dat science
<[]DeadpoolDash> lolz
<Java> that's bullshit
<Java> turtle?
<Java> WTF?
<KrazyNoobs> Yup... anything that isn't science in a nutshell
<Alchemist> ew
<Java> That turtle only guard one of the gate, that's all!
<[]DeadpoolDash> turtle turtle turtle
<KrazyNoobs> Just people saying/believing things they think they excel at... it's all in their head
<valoreins> inb4 i liek turtles
<killerpony7733> oh watch this
<[]DeadpoolDash> way to ruin the flow there guy
<KrazyNoobs> valoreins is a zombie
<killerpony7733> They made sure to videotape those bastards
*valoreins becomes a zombie
*KrazyNoobs runs from valoreins
<Dark92Enigma> OH DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT MY TURTLES!"
<Dark92Enigma> I LIKE TURTLES!
*valoreins noms Krazynoobs
<Java> BULLSHIT!
*KrazyNoobs becomes zombie
*KrazyNoobs likes turtles
<Java> what?
<Java> Bordello?
<[]DeadpoolDash> lolz
<Alchemist> they should refurnish the apartment in accodance with one the guides and they should call in another feng shui guide into the refurnished one and watch them override each other's setups.
<JRP2234> P LOADBLOCKS: DATA FAILURE
<KrazyNoobs> I wonder if the admins will kick people who give spoilers about S3E7 before the episode's official air?
<KrazyNoobs> I hope so
<KrazyNoobs> awkward silence is awkward
<[]DeadpoolDash> move the stuff to make more money in his wallet
<JRP2234> DR ASHENS
<valoreins> i'd prefer watching the new ep here, with you guys <3
<Java> Real Feng Shui is not like this at all :(
<Java> they really ruin real FengShui
<Java> Those people are opportunistic assholes
<KrazyNoobs> If people only followed REAL science, our world would be a much more accurate place.
<JRP2234> Come as you are
<Alchemist> nice haircut
<Kandarihu> Feng Shui is more of an art than a science.
<KrazyNoobs> Conduct studies, and make a hypothesis... that would be how to find the best way to decorate. Obviously, the answer would be, "to the decorator's desire".
<jbh1145> hey guys
<KrazyNoobs> hi jbh1145
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: and thats nice, the problem is when people pass it as science
<jbh1145> lol penn and teller
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, indeed.
<jbh1145> which pen and teller episode is this?
<Yukikaze> What episode of bullshit is this?
<KrazyNoobs> Feng Shui, jbh1145

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> um. no >_>
<jbh1145> i already seen the new episode :D but i wont spoil anything
<KrazyNoobs> I am starting to think that some people that specialize in "FengShui" are using "the science" and "the energy" to sell their products, such as Fountains
<killerpony7733> SeaponiesofLiverpool Oh boy not good
<Yukikaze> Do you need a license to do Feng Shui?
<Alchemist> WTF? Im changing professions this instant. Im sure I could sell it as science more effectively as these nutjobs.
<Vivix> Don't link unaired episodes

<Sumica> 00,10it's a warning shot round that I keep chanbered in my spaz12
<AttackWithHugs> I'd get the boobs bumper sticker
<Dark_Horst> oh, beanbags
<SpeccyRush> rocksalt, it'll hurt like hell with the added bonus of being able to fend off errant spirits with
<Wrek> 05i dont want numbers when i hear murders in a country
<Sumica> 00,10will sting like crazy but wont kill unless close range
<Wrek> 05i want a percentage
<Wrek> 05with a percentage
<SirGanjalf> hehe, "ballistic"
<Wrek> 05you can compare to otehr countries
<JRP2234> wrek because were idoits
<Sumica> 00,10also it's only home defence if the body lands in the home
<Wrek> 05i can see it from your view though and all
<Wrek> 05for isntance
<Sumica> 00,10and it's no longer self defence if you reload
<Wrek> 05sumi got a shotgun
<Wrek> 05sure
<Wrek> 05handguns and revilvers? sure
<Wrek> 05but i see no real reason to have fullblown assault rifles
<Wrek> 05thats a bit overkill
<Rose`> if you are of able body, and an adult, and you cannot defend yourself
<Rose`> dont expext to be defended
<Sumica> 00,10loaded stastic
<Wrek> 0587% of all statistics are made up
<Wrek> 05take them with salt
<Rose`> i have an assault rifle
<Wrek> 05rocksalt maybe
<Sumica> 00,10that's like saying 75% of all car wrecks happen withen 5 miles of home
<Rose`> and an RPG but thats for recreational use
<JRP2234> its chef
<Sumica> 00,10of corse more wrecks happen close to home you spend more time there
<Rose`> 100% of all wreks live within 2 miles of their homes
<Sumica> 00,10the northholiwood sgooting I watched happen live
<YokusaHHart> this is a bit of a sesitive issue, isn't it?
<Sumica> 00,10one of the guys shot him self in the face trying to look down the barrle of his gun to see what it jamed on
<Sumica> 00,10nice carbine

<Rose`> well, wrek

<thelonepony> Alchemist: i havent, and tbh, i dont care for my religion
<Alchemist> Sumica: maybe the first part is the "thanks to..." section.
<Jmo> o_O
<thisguyLuis> :D
<Sumica> 00,10big ass apple
<thisguyLuis> AJ might not like what role the apple plays in that story :X
<Sumica> 00,10he did't die, he just went home
<APPAJAK> thats my apple!
<Kandarihu> I can't have the audio for the stream right now, but I do have something that needs explaining, and I'll explain at the end of this.
<Alchemist> AJ would have bucked that apple the f*ck down without the snake tempting her
<Rose`> elvise was always a zombie
<Rose`> dont forget a half cup of blood
<thisguyLuis> dat stream x.x
<Sumica> 00,10amount of flour dont matter
<Rose`> i always add blood to my recepies
<thisguyLuis> yay elvis <3
<Sumica> 00,10you could call for a lb of flour
<Dark_Horst> hungarian bloodsausage
<Dark_Horst> bloody deliciousy
<Sumica> 00,10it would not matter cause you only use what sticks to the chicken
<Dark_Horst> *badum, tss*
<Wrek> 05tried swedish blood pudding Dark_Horst? is awesome with ligonberry jam
<Dark_Horst> gotta write that down
<Sumica> 00,10big boat
<APPAJAK> this guy is gonna make me lol
<APPAJAK> he makes every excuse for an illogical story
<thelonepony> gtg
<Kandarihu> And the whole "something coming out of nothing" gets a free pass, though.
<Alchemist> ?
<Sumica> 00,10well they have to suspend some disbleafe just to get the story rolling Kandarihu
<Kandarihu> Sumica, that's how atheists try to explain the beginning of the universe.
<Wrek> 05not really
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: its not proven yet
<Alchemist> maybe never will
<Wrek> 05i personalyl believe a big bang occurs every time a black hoel collapses
<Rose`> i like magic
<Wrek> 05theres evidence that the mass of black hoels corrode over time
<Rose`> :o
<Wrek> 05untill a point where its so small it implodes upon itself
<Kandarihu> A chaotic unguided mass of subatomic particles becoming intelligent life?
<Wrek> 05im no scientist
<Wrek> 05but it seesm plausible
<Sumica> 00,10that almost sounds the start of a relegion wrek. Some one beleaveing somthing
<Wrek> 05as for intelligent life
<Alchemist> thats a bit over simplified but why not?
<Wrek> 05its severly oversimplified
<Wrek> 05but dust becoming planets over the course of shit
<Wrek> 05cant be arsed to explain in detail
<Wrek> 05single cell organsisms becoming bigger over time
<Wrek> 05we didnt start intellectual
<CCharmanderK> Hey, gaaaiiiiiz
<Wrek> 05took some time
<Sumica> 00,10sup CCharmanderK
<Dark_Horst> i say the people thinking we'e the only intelligent life out there are the nutjobs
<Dark_Horst> seriously
<APPAJAK> ^
<Wrek> 05michio otako explaisn it ratehr well Dark92Enigma
<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst
<Dark_Horst> we cant even imagine how many fircking stars there are in the universe
<Alchemist> Wrek: here its explained how its possible for "unguided mass" to become organic material.
<Alchemist> http://exploringorigins.org/protocell.html
<Kandarihu> Technically, dolphins are as intelligent as humans, but they don't have civilization, though.
<Dark_Horst> beleiveing we're the only happy coincidence is... well, bullshit
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: of that one i never heard
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: whats the quantifier of intelligence?
<Wrek> 05we have 2 flukes
<Wrek> 05opposign thumbs
<Wrek> 05and a basic primal instinct of beign in large groups
<Wrek> 05the cohesion of large groups
<Wrek> 05is needed to have civilization
<Sumica> 00,10one thing I like about this show
<MLP_Brovakiin> xD
<Sumica> 00,10you dont have to watch it
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, what? Are we changing the standard of intelligence to qualify more animals as equally intelligent as humans?
<Sumica> 00,10you can just listen
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: I didnt say such thing, I just asked.
<Wrek> 05ah yes
<Dark_Horst> Je'sus? is that, like, a klingon messias or somethin?
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, this is the first time I've ever heard of "quantifier of intelligence".
<Rose`> ahah
<Wrek> 05it was stephen hawking that discovered the concept of the particles that erode the mass of the lump that is a black hole
<Rose`> actual footage XD
<Malmortius> What is this crapola :l
<Rainpoke> Okey~ lol
<Malmortius> Wrek, have you heard of a game called Don't starve? that would be extremely entertaining to watch.
<Dark_Horst> i'm pretty sure they nicked his corpse
<Wrek> 05Malmortius: i have
<Dark_Horst> people do funny stuff like that to messias folks
<Wrek> 05and im really wanting to play it
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: what I wanted to ask, how did they measure and conclude that dolphins are as intelligent as humans.
<Rose`> i wanna play it too
<Malmortius> Its amazing.
<Wrek> 05anotehr fluke
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: because I dont know.
<Wrek> 05is language
<Wrek> 05the way humans commune
<Wrek> 05compared to other animals
<Wrek> 05that
<Wrek> 05plus thumbs
<Malmortius> Why don't you buy it Wrek? Its pretty cheap.
<Wrek> 05plus the need of human company ie groups
<Wrek> 05=civilization
<thisguyLuis> meh, talks about religion bore me :X
<Kandarihu> Alchemist, oh, sorry. I think it's because they have language that can equate to human speech and have been known to be capable of morality an altruism.
<Malmortius> You get 2 copies btw, Wrek.
<Malmortius> I recieved mine from a friend :P
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: i didnt know their 2language" was that complex.
<RaveBrony> Woot, Wrek Session! What is this ep on??
<APPAJAK> bible
<Wrek> 05RaveBrony aye i fixed the session logo
<RaveBrony> Sweet : D
<Dark_Horst> ten commandments? dont be an asshole. that's all ten there
<Wrek> 05no black shitty unproffesional look
<Wrek> 05the first ammendment is self policing
<Wrek> 05the rest are covered in it
<thisguyLuis> yay elvis <3
<Rainpoke> he's just saying no one can tell all ten
<RaveBrony> So, the Bible is bullshit?
<Rainpoke> it's only just killing
<Rainpoke> RaveBrony, You can say that
<RaveBrony> I see :P
<RaveBrony> Ok, maybe not stone to death. But kids are too out of order today...

*AttackWithHugs kidnamps PoniesSchool47 and fluffies his mane

<Panda> PoniesSchool47: :| "School"
<APPAJAK> twilee background?

<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: that not. but from what i gathered the crationism takes the bible by word in everything regarding the world being created in 6k years
<JRP2234> johny
<RaveBrony> "click"
<Panda> And hello there MLP_Brovakiin, how art thou.
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: or were those a splinter group?

<PoniesSchool47> and now I must run~
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, there's that floating around. It's called Young Earth Creationism. Personally, I don't believe in it. I think God has a sort of time dilation where a day for him is many many years for us.
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: You said that you wanted my Skype name?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Panda: Ohh, I hope you feel better soon buddy :)
<PoniesSchool47> Bye~
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye PoniesSchool47 :)
<APPAJAK> here's some food for thought: What was the measurement for one day when God was creating the Earth? Could it be that one day for God is thousands of years?
<thisguyLuis> hope you feel better, panda. i had one hell of an illness about a week ago myself
<RaveBrony> While Mr. Ed is a Great show, it would still rustle the newbies jimmies.
<Panda> Meh, it's just the seasonal flu. Nothing too drastic.
<APPAJAK> i wants some russled jimmies!
<thisguyLuis> i blamed it on chinese food that i ate before that :X
<Panda> RaveBrony anything non-pony would rustle the jimmies of the newfags.
<APPAJAK> get em russeled!
<RaveBrony> Panda: Very true! :D
<RaveBrony> But Mr. Ed is a horse of course :3
<Alchemist> APPAJAK: then watch the comment section of any video on YT that deals with religion or atheism
<Panda> RaveBrony, btw, how is Sai treating you so far?

<Midnight_Fyre> Wrek: Nicely said
<TrixieMuffin> but then all the blood will come out
<Wrek> 05pfft
<RaveBrony> Too bad the world just wants your money for the 'Generous' title. Lol

<Snow> its a challenge for artists for the upcomming hollidays(like chrismass etc) to offer for any willing amount of people to draw their OC for free. it can be anything, from quick sketches to portraits, whatever is easier for the artist that is making them.
<Snow> pffft that was hard to nutshell that D:

<Wrek> 05as do I
<Sundaysmile> I can imagine that this saturday will exceed the 6000 viewer limit no?
<Sundaysmile> well... not limit
<Snow> ive seen the ep, so i guess it will
<Sundaysmile> but record
<RaveBrony> I think the record is past 6000
<Midnight_Fyre> probably not. I bet a lot of people watched the leak and will skip saturday morning
*Snow backs away slowly
<Sundaysmile> it was a ballpark figure on my part :P
<Midnight_Fyre> I'm going to avoid the leak and wait til saturday
<AJIsAwesome> And I'm guessing some people will be jerks and attempt to spoil it in manechat as well. :|
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: ever thought about oputting dash in conglomerate armor?
<Wrek> 05dash isnt a conglomerate
<Dark_Horst> who is then?
<Midnight_Fyre> AJIsAwesome: Which is why I won't be on manechat
<Wrek> 05AJ
<AttackWithHugs> Okay guys, what do you think? http://i.imgur.com/gckOf.jpg
<Snow> ive seen it and im not gonna spoil it AJIsAwesome :P
<Dark_Horst> hmmmmmmmmm
<RaveBrony> Pfft, Dash. Needs more Armored Rarity :$
<AJIsAwesome> AttackWithHugs: I like it. :)
<Sundaysmile> can't see dash in Vanu or Terran though... just doesn't fit her to me
<RaveBrony> AttackWithHugs: Nice work :)
<Dark_Horst> hm... rarity in purple spandex.... yeah why not
<AttackWithHugs> Woo
<Wrek> 05aye
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Wrek> 05twi and rarity are vanu
<Wrek> 05shys a pushover so i guess TR
<RaveBrony> vanu?
<Sundaysmile> almost makes me want to switch sides to vanu....
<SpanishInquisition> NOPONY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!
<Sundaysmile> but not that much
<Dark_Horst> so what would make that pinkie?
<Wrek> 05no allcaps
<Snow> Dark_Horst: thanks, now i got that picture of molestia in that spandex in my mind again D:
<Sundaysmile> Pinkie is the server downtime
<Dark_Horst> Snow: happy to be of service

<Wrek> 05good subs these
<Wrek> 05excpet for this part
<SpanishInquisition> Dat Qu'ran excerpt
<RaveBrony> :L
<Snow> it was a trap
<Wrek> 05which is why i dont trust 2rd party subs
<Snow> because they said akbar.
<CCharmanderK> There, much better.
<Wrek> 053*
<Snow> ohai dere
<Dark_Horst> i personally think aj and dash would both fit conglomerate. aj becasue she'S stubborn like that and dash becasuase... dunno... she kinda seems the type to fight opression. she's also a hot nhead
<Midnight_Fyre> They'll have to go to the dollar store to pick up another True Cross, I guess

<RaveBrony> I grew a beard by watching this movie, and just shaved it off in Arn's honor.
<GnomeWithMushroom> guess another good movie?
<Java> Arcium, I'm an Indonesian but did I yell in my language? English is the language we talk here. Unless suddenly everyone able to speak Swahili or something

<Arcium> Java: its norwegian
<GnomeWithMushroom> Warrior so awesome
<Java> Yep

<Java> That's a good movie, even when they need to cut the battle because of budget .
<Midnight_Fyre1> Wrek: Perhaps some Bergman next?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I like it. Thanks! :)
<GnomeWithMushroom> Thanks Wrek, was pretty interesting
<Dark_Horst> he just played us the movies of hi people

<Stallion_of_War> GnomeWithMushroom: So you're not familiar with this mush of English we use here in the US, ehh?
<Java> Wrex, I know this is kinda selfish for me, but I think you need to show The Raid: Redemption here? at night of course because of violence
<Stallion_of_War> Basically US English is like Chex Party Mix. It has some stuff in it you recognize and a lot of weird bits.
<Wrek> 05i would
<Jmo> Pffft, bacon.
<ouo> Stallion_of_War never i do >_>

<Sumica> 00,10it's free
<Wrek> 05you are jsut in the wrong place
<Drew> That's amazing!
<Java> I used to explosive trailers
<MadSurge> Drew: f2p!
<Vordox> Where all graphic are put into the GPU, and ignore the CPU
<Dark_Horst> if i'm lucky, they're here tomorrow
<Sundaysmile> shame I'm on a diff server :P
<RaveBrony> When i play PS2, i got lost for half an hour, lmao
<Kandarihu> I wish my computer could run this game.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i doubt my laptop could handle ps2
<Sumica> 00,10we have an NC squad on Woodman
<Serenity> I can't run PS2 graphically
<Lindeman> Mhm
<Wrek> 05the Vanu
<ouo> Vanu is gay >_>
<Lindeman> FUCK YEAH!
<Wrek> 05more commonly known as spandex wearign wubsteppers
<Sumica> 00,10spandax erewhere
<Sundaysmile> until they offer the option to server hop - then I can't offer my medic support
<killerpony7733> Wrek In the NC we wear heavy composite armor and we got rock music
<killerpony7733> :D
<Sumica> 00,10btw they removed facton locks on the servers
<Java> get in the vanu
<ouo> their tanks anuses not prepared
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: about damn time
<Sumica> 00,10then Space korea
<Kandarihu> Sumica, what does that mean? Being able to make characters of multiple factions on the same server?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Kandarihu
<MadSurge> So what's the advantage of every faction?
<Wrek> 05ah the TR
<Sundaysmile> granted, I hate the choral music of the terrans, but I LOVE playing the Klendathu Drop Music during raids
<Wrek> 05peashooters and spray n payers
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<Sundaysmile> and bum rushers
<SpeccyRu_> ?
<ouo> New Conglomerate have best soundtrack ever
<RainbowPengy> vanu as the fastest reload terran the fire speed and the other is the demage they do
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> This game needs a BR raid
<Java> If they change the characters to Warhammer marines......
<Sumica> 00,10NC hit hard
<Sundaysmile> And play hard
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: vanu have fast reloads and no to very little bullet drop, but their damage decreases over distance. NC hit hard but hae heavy recoil and slow firerated. terrans have i firerates, low spread and less damage per bullet
<Sumica> 00,10VS have lasers pew pew
<ouo> Java, yep, and they would be better look
<Sumica> 00,10but they suck at long range

<Scootaflew> djblazekin: I've heard it doesn't work on windows 7, I have a copy myself and it has yet to work. I haven't tested it on a vista computer, so I can't be sure it isn't just a defective disk.

<DerpyWhooves> I don't exactly consider that a spoiler
<Java> wait, if I can't read, how do I type this?
<Kipkat07_USAF> Yahooz: I wouldnt really care about the economic failure, just to be with my dad again is enough
