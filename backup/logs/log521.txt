<RyunosukeKnT> hmm
<Videofreak1127[M]> 42 meaning of life
<RyunosukeKnT> should have been hudson hawk tbh :)
<Ghosties> 04Because nobody could find Hawk Jones
<Meanwhile> No Shamroc yer a slag.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> alexxm: because ppl are trolls and make mods try and find a movie no one has
<Ghosties> 04It's a *really* obscure 80's film
<AgentKalim> sergio_scriptor: I'm so hungry, I could eat a Tom
<Videofreak1127[M]> #orgy
<Custard> Ok so the A movie is gonna be looped...?

<bronycross> derpy is
<Polydunami> I've seen bits and pieces of Clerks
<One-up> reporter
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Is there going to be a rule about picking b movies that are hard to find ?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> against*
<flutter_spin> any chance of having some stream beforehoof?
<alexxm> FairysHuff i usaully watch both
<Ghosties> 04I was actually struggling between Fear & Loathing and Clerks as B movie
<AgentKalim> FairysHuff: I'm gonna be here tomorrow.
<RAWRity> I know theres at least 1 download of my B movie floating out there.
<FairysHuff> alexxm: YAY! Company ^_^
<RAWRity> Ghosties: I'd have loved to have seen Fear and Loathing
<One-up> kewl
<AgentKalim> I used to watch both, when I was still here a few months ago.
<sagas> Ghosties: FEAR & LOATHING!
<RAWRity> because damn is that movie cool.
<FairysHuff> AgentKalim: YAY! More companys! HUGS ^_^
<sagas> Ghosties: YOU CHANGE IT NOW!
<bronycross> clerks
<Ghosties> 04But Fear & Loathing was released nationwide with a really large budget. Clerks did not get that kind of release, the budget was really low and not released in many places
<AgentKalim> Now for the summer holidays, I hope I will be staying more again.
*Michael feels ignored
<flutter_spin> Naps for every pony!
<Custard> Yay~ 39 more minutes :)
<Ghosties> 04Plus, Clerks is just as good as Fear & Loathing if not better
<One-up> let's all finish this story together
<alexxm> RAWRity what was your b movie
<AgentKalim> FairysHuff: Set phasers to HUUUUUUG
<RAWRity> alexxm: Nudist Colony of the Dead
<nightwatchman> while waiting for the movie to start im watching star trek the next generation.
<sergio_scriptor> i swear to god Ghosties one of these days i will demand to see " Max the magician" :| you guys own me that JK:$
<One-up> When I walked out side I saw...
<sagas> Fear and Loathing is not very well know and Clerks is famous
<alexxm> RAWRity cinema snob fan brohoof (\
<Custard> sagas: But I've never seen Clerks.
<Kandarihu> I've been insisting on having a B Movie that's always going to be found on Youtube. Now I'm switching to one that can be found on Steam.
<bronycross> 1 vote foe clerks
<RAWRity> alexxm: /)
<FairysHuff> AgentKalim: *Ultimate running jumping spinning cyclone hugs of luuuuuuuuuurv*
<kempa> Hello all! How are ya doing all?
<Ghosties> 04I get that, sagas. But as it stands Clerks really is the epitome of an indie film
<Custard> You know what I've never seen Hunchback.
<sagas> Ghosties: I guess
<Custard> So scratch that.
<One-up> good!
<alexxm> i'm good kempa how about you
<One-up> Who want's bronwines!
<RAWRity> Idea: Twilight Breaking Dawn part 1 as A movie
<AgentKalim> No
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I will end you.
<Michael> hai kempa
<Kandarihu> So Fear & Loathing had a big budget. I take it that movie wasn't successful?
<AgentKalim> the only good Twilight is Twilight Sparkle.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> RAWRity: lol
<Ghosties> 04It got pretty bad reviews by critics, but the audience loved it if I recall
<One-up> I made them special from the bottom of my neighbor's liver!
<AgentKalim> I watched The Room, but you're NOT making me watch Twilight
<bronycross> jay and silient bob need i say more
<RyunosukeKnT> I vote for "Cheech and Chong: Up in smoke" or "Born in East LA" :)
<AgentKalim> YOU ARE NAAAAAAAAAHT
<bronycross> ?
<Darkness_Pony> Pewdiepie anyone?
<Ghosties> 04Fear & Loathing is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I see.
<Lyra> BARRELZZZ

<FillyFlam> LAAAAW
<Ghosties> 04YOU BETRAID THE LAUGH

<RAWRity> Fear and Loathing got mixed scores when it came out IIRC
<owlicious> don't call my name, alejandro
<Custard> YES :D
<FillyFlam> Custard: No. That's just an ad.
<ThunderCloud> FairysHuff: good luck 6_9
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> owlicious: the odds of it being WMC is going to be low since we'd all make fun of every thing that happens in that movie
<AgentKalim> Fear and Loathing in Las Pegasus

<StinkomanFan> Ameobas?
<Firelight> saigneur: give it a lick.. mmh it taste like rainbows
<EspyLacopa> Suddenly ants.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Phoebus' anthropomorphic horse is named Achilles. The name gives two jokes. At one point, Phoebus commands, "Achilles, sit!" - and the horse promptly sits down. first, it assumes (correctly, in this case) that the war horse will obey a command normally used for a trained dog. Second, the line is a pun on the phrase "Achilles' heel", a term for a person's weakness
<Polydunami> Reboot, Ghosties
<Silverscreen> 1,11(which itself derives from Achilles in Greek mythology, who was invulnerable except for one heel; the Achilles tendon in the ankle is also named for this).

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the novel, Frollo is actually the Archdeacon. The filmmakers decided to change the character to a judge because they felt it would make him more sinister to have control over the city and therefore would not be questioned in his attempts to destroy the Gypsies.

<Custard> The gala :)
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Nostalgia Critic put Hellfire as #1 of his best Villains Songs list. He claims that it's because, rather than singing about how evil he is, he sings about his own failures and obsession and how he's to cure himself of it.
<Bronysith> otakon: you just spoiled it again
*Bjornfot strokes otakons hair and whispers into his ear "Haiii~"

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This was sort of an awkward time for a comedic relief song.
<Matt> Ahhh watching this again you get all the jokes that you didn't before.
<Sumica> 00,10well this is also a movie that you know parents would have to take the kids to see.
<Everlasting_Joy> SolairePony891: :D, not only that, they were probably too young.

<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, this movie was also made in the dark age of comics, which pretty much consumed all the other media.

<Whiskra> suddenly, daytime
<Ersatz> EVERYONE died in the original
*Bronysith gives fluttercry glasses
<DocSane> Hunchback of Notre Dame: Friendzone is Magic

*Custard blinks
<MEGAe25> and the hero doesint get the girl.... THE END
<Meanwhile> By a factor of like four million/
<Freefall29> damn
<CriticKitten> Silverscreen: Yes, along with Esmerelda.
<Spazturtle> All three of them died in the book
<Custard> No fire.
<Ingwaz> Silverscreen: apparently
<Thedude946z[Movie]> 10/10
<SolairePony89> Bronysith: Hmm... then The Joker
<Darkness_Pony> KISS
<RanYakumo> Silverscreen: Yup. And everyone in Paris was a jerk, including the captain and Esmeralda.
<AlienWarhead> No fire damage
<oni_link> Silverscreen: so did esmeralda
<Custard> All fine.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or the protagonist dying.
<Blaze> This movie is strange, because the protaginist DOESN'T get the girl in the end.
<RosePetal> You can come out.
<Custard> WTF XD
<Nightbringer> Quasimodo: I can hit it whenever I want bros.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's for kids.
<StinkomanFan> NO ONE DIES LIKE GASTON

<Gaston> she grabbs the audience
<machinistbrony> he's the patro saint of freindzoned
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Quasi dies, The Gypsy suicdes
<TheXIIILightning> The sun, it burns!!

<One-up> it burn's!!!!!!!

<SpeedyBolt> Do not throw shit
<Buytoast> So yes.
<Bronysith> Randomnerd: i love beauty and the beast
<TOY_PON3> my eyes!
<StinkomanFan> NO ONE FALLS LIKE GASTON
<TheXIIILightning> Pet the monster!
<Lexias> I thought I herd Esmerelda died in the book, but they made this one more lighthearted o3o
<QuasIshmoto> Yo Bronysith Imma let you finish, but Evil Superman from Superman IV is the best villain of all tim
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: /)
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Yep. Hellfire's for kids. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> eh, the protanost dying offers nothing, so why kill him
<IowaBrony> I can't decide who had the worst Disney death. Frollo fell into a pit of lava, Scar was eaten alive, Sykes (from Oliver & Company) got hit by a train. Disney was just violent.
<Freefall29> I guess quasi is gonna be foreveralone.jpg
<RX-78-SweetieBot> We should watch Them!
<Lexias> *heard
<HurricaneAkumin> Frollo's dead, and everyone's happy now.
<MasterBoss43> :D
<TheRareP0N3> lol.
<StormChaser> so...much...d'awwwwwwwwwww
<Kandarihu> Well, for the time this movie came out, there isn't enough killing for this movie to be considered suitable for adults.

She shoos them off and asks them if they ever migrate. The fact is, rock doves (the most common breed of pigeon seen in urban areas) do NOT migrate, at least not in the same sense other birds migrate. They may move from one part of a city to another,
