<Veewave> bye Flutteguy
<Euponytor> pony_2841: SLOWPOKE.JPG
<MoonMirror> G4 is too rushed
<RoboPlop> Not anymore. Stream just ended.
<PinkieP> Well.
<DashWithRainbows> september 24th...
<thunderhooves> also there be no spelling here
<Double> So apparently AJ == Han Solo
<RAWRity> some were worried early on, but I knew you guys would pull it out...bowchickabowwow
<PinkieP> That WAS the re run
<Poots> From what I've seen of episode 1.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<Poots> going on the tubes.
<Turtaguin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omhSnagjOL0
<PinkieP> It might be up now.
<pony_2841> DAMN
<Nittany_Discord> I dunno if Babes in Toyland beats A Pig's Tale for worst movie. Babes in Toyland is officially too long, though.
<DashWithRainbows> The Day Ponies not only defeated Discord...
<appleBloom> you know...it should of been better when apple bloom was the cause to bring apple jack back to her honesty but again, thats just me
<Nightfall_Shimmer> And Celestia makes Twilight and her friends do everything while she gives slight hints as to what should be done, all while clopping up in her tower.
<Ichijoe> G4 is Awesome you shut your whore mouth
<DashWithRainbows> But took over the whole internets
<PinKAMINA> Thanks Turtaguin
<Euponytor> your timing was off bro, you're an hour late
<Tovler> The ending to Babes was so schmultzy that if forced crying emotions
<Al_Cove> Keep and eye on EqD for youtube episode updates.
<pony_3560> lemme recheck if they're there
<prince-dari> If no one else is streaming, I'll stream requests I suppose.
<pony_2841> why is it just lifestream
<pony_2841> i mean
<Falcon> Clop Clop Clop
<RoboPlop> There's probably some stream replaying the whole thing somewhere.
<Girl> Will Discord be back? :(
<MoonMirror> No my whore mouth is busy with surprise and licketysplit
<Nocturne> had my doubts about season 2, but so far its awesome ^
<CloudRunner> I repeat Gurren Lagann!
<PinkieP> Nah
<DSNesmith> Spider's Web was laughably bad, Babes in Toyland was literally painful to watch and it was TWO HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES LONG
<DashWithRainbows> im going to go cook me some pizza :3
<Kdude> i hope to see everypony next episode, goodbye!
<pony_2841> why cant they put up the episode like on youtube
<Veewave> Megas XLR

<ValtheJean> 2,14 fare thee well bronies

<RustyStar> the take of the hall is the biggest give
<thunderhooves> oh right
<Nittany_Discord> Speaking of college football, Penn State needs a better kicker!

<RustyStar> I heard the music and I thought: OH NO THEY DIDN'T!!! XD
<appleBloom> yeah ^^
<TheSillyOne42> put on flutterguy singin zakoras song
<Nittany_Discord> Clemson is fighting Florida State. This is going to be interesting.
<ashleylovegood> we will never speak of this again!
<Mu> Who needs Giant Rock when you have Tom?

<DSNesmith> no Ingram does the singing songs
<DSNesmith> who does the BGM
<pony_7177> Are there any sites replaying the episode? I wanted to avoid the rush

<TheDoctor> well this certainly is...inetresting...
<Nocturne> http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3386195953_f3ceaa433c.jpg this seems relevant...
<Natleyn> Highest I saw was /almost/ 1.5k
<Mu> and lying AJ's lieface was the stuff of legends
<MrPoniator> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cvhGp9t2AU

<RustyStar> >:(
<kilemeino> i wonder what age do you think the mane6 are
<lunar_sparkle> well anyways, cya I don't want to get spoilered
<Apokalipse> Both the audio and video are broken
<Apokalipse> or not the video, it just skips a lot
<Mu> I'd guess mid-teens, around 15-17
<Veewave> I'm getting serious lag.
<RustyStar> wow.....
<RustyStar> disturbing.......
<anon> Later ponies
<CosmicChan_> i would volunteer to stream with bronystate except my internets suck :(
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, it's been fun everypony, but I've got homework to do :P. Later!

<DSNesmith> so how long do you guys think before someone cuts together the ending with SW music?
<RoboPlop> Can't believe I fell for that one...
<CosmicChan_> a day tops
<RoboPlop> Enjoy!
*Natleyn hugs SuperBrony64
<Mu> Well, I think more 16-17
<Natleyn> Peace~
<Natleyn> Hiya RainBroDash

<prince-dari> Hey RainBro.

<DashWithRainbows> octagon!
<CosmicChan_> octagon!
<Mu> but yeh
<CosmicChan_> aww
<RustyStar> once upon an octagon
<DSNesmith> now the real question is:
<DSNesmith> who = who
<RoboPlop> Well I think I'm done for today. Goodbye everypony!
<DSNesmith> Twilight = Luke obviously
<ashleylovegood> who would be the oldest hmm
<MeteorVenture> looool doctor rabbit
<Mu> Oh, and I remember when some people were saying they'd heard that season 2 takes place 5 years after season 1
<Poots> I guess it's gonna be paint. Also! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cvhGp9t2AU&hd=1 HD is up.
<Mu> and I had to lul
<CosmicChan_> became a faggot o.o
<DSNesmith> Rarity is C3P0
<RustyStar> mah little boi
<Mu> I think either Fluttershy or Rarity
<Natleyn> Spike = Rainbow Dash = ???
<MeteorVenture> anyway take care i think i'm going too
<Poots> You can enjoy that too, everypony.
<ashleylovegood> i think twilight or rarity or apple would be the oldest
<GabeMoist> pudding
<CosmicChan_> trippy
<DashWithRainbows> i cant stop laughing....
<DSNesmith> AJ is Chewie
<GabeMoist> . . .
<Nittany_Discord> Ugh. That buffering.
<DashWithRainbows> 911 rainbow dash...
<CosmicChan_> y it lag so much
<Mu> AJ like, second-oldest under Fluttershy or Rarity, imo
<Fluttershy`> 08,1RainBroDash -pokes-

<appleBloom> http://pachirisufan667.deviantart.com/art/my-first-attempt-on-Applebloom-259610629
<Mu> Who'd be youngest? lol
<Wizzardess> Hm, interesting question. They all have important jobs (farming, weather management, wildlife carer (or ranger), baker etc...) yet I would put their mentality somewhere in the mid-late teens.
<RustyStar> wow
<ashleylovegood> rainbow
<ashleylovegood> or pinkie
<ashleylovegood> maybe
<GGgala_> ...how have i never seen these pony thread simulators before
<Lolipop_of_Doom> lolwut

<Apokalipse> ahahahahaha SHOO BE DOO
<appleBloom> thank you ^^
<Nittany_Discord> FlutterSea Pony.
<Mu> And I see Fluttershy as being a little older than everyone else, and that just making her shy factor even cuter. lol
<CosmicChan_> SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<Natleyn> SHOO BE DOO
<RustyStar> shooooooo beeeeeee dooooo
<Apokalipse> I'm a seapony motherfuker SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<pony_448> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwe0daWswqc&feature=feedu
<ashleylovegood> i see it as: rarity, twilight, applejack, flutter, pinkie, rainbow
<Mu> Besides, when she got her cutie mark she was the only one shown as being bigger than everyone else
<pony_448> *nod*
<ashleylovegood> but i just pulled that out of thin air
<Mu> so actually, I think Fluttershy is the oldest
<RustyStar> trippy
<Mu> lol

<Aponymous> We're watching a very captivating black screen
<DashWithRainbows> wow outside looks really dull...
<Nocturne> might be, not failure with carrot top, definitly not dr whooves
<LordCelestia> me too
<True_Discord> Yay for Black Screen
<LordCelestia> DashWithRainbows where do you live? its gloomy here too
<DashWithRainbows> i live in the UK - Eastmidland - Kettering
<LordCelestia> oh
<LordCelestia> you sir are VERY FAR away
*Veewave sees the clear sky
<DashWithRainbows> i know. im trying to find some other bronies in this town
<Veewave> lovely
<DashWithRainbows> not getting any results
<AppleBloom> *passes out*
<LordCelestia> im only a brony on the internet. in real life my identity is secret
<Edward_Newgate> DisciePie discuss
<Natleyn> Edward_Newgate: nope.jpg
<Nocturne> re-watching the episode for potential memes i may have missed, so far all i got is spike=rainbow dash, and pony clones....dont think the clones are gonna catch on though
<True_Discord> Wow that chat really has slowed down
<Aponymous> I believe the proper name is DiscoPie
<DashWithRainbows> i go on things like EQD and Bronystate in class, people look at my screen and dont give a shit...
<Edward_Newgate> Not even
<Veewave> LordCelestia = Twoface Brony
<Ziltoid> Flutterbitch will be huge
<DashWithRainbows> family doesnt care about me much anyways
<Edward_Newgate> I've been saying Discie Pie since the first episode came out
<Aponymous> Screwball better become memetic.
<Natleyn> I can think of a few others.
<Nocturne> perhaps tom the rock
<Natleyn> Screwball is awesome.
<Aponymous> I demand fanart of the new best Pony
<Natleyn> Tom is canon, so that's awesome
<Aponymous> Oh yeah, I can stop calling him The Rock now.
<Natleyn> Kung Fu Rarity...
<LordCelestia> DID DOMEPONY SAY CANNON?
<Ziltoid> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/454985.html
<DashWithRainbows> those spike = rainbow dash pics came quick
*LordCelestia prepares moon cannon
<Ziltoid> Tom^
<Veewave> Every time my mom comes over she laughs and asks why I still watch cartoons/
<Aponymous> Not sure if I'm okay with that...
<Natleyn> Aponymous: Yeah, it was getting confusing between Tom and the rock that gave her her cutie mark
<Nocturne> yea, saw some shooped spikes already
<Aponymous> The Spikedash pics came REALLY fast, I was shocked.
<Natleyn> Yeah
*Veewave says to mom "It isn't cartoons it's ponies"
<LordCelestia> lol
<Nocturne> pinky pie singing chocolate rain came pretty fast last week
<Aponymous> This means I need to make an alternate version of that line art I colored the other night.
<pony_3669> did S2E2 air today?

<DashWithRainbows> damn i was ninja'd
<MrPoniator> :)
<LordCelestia> Mankind needs to make a device that not only wakes you up but makes you FEEl awake too, like a stimulant alarm
*Veewave pats Flutters on the back "There there don't feel sad BronyState chat was going by to fast anyway."
<Flutterz> yeah...
<Aponymous> It's called putting your alarm in a place you need to get up to go and turn it off.
<Nocturne> star wars ponies, that will probably catch on fast too
<FreezeFrame> That's what I do!
<DashWithRainbows> already some pics for it so...
<DashWithRainbows> and a fanfic
<Natleyn> I thought it was called having something to look forward to.
<Natleyn> A fanfic
<Natleyn> Seriously

<Natleyn> Bloody wizards
<Aponymous> We're faster than light. Like Neutrinos.
*Veewave basks in wizardly power

<Natleyn> Why D:
<Aponymous> ohai Interior_Gummy
<Aponymous> BLASPHEMER
<interior_gummy> ohai
<GabeMoist> I liked it
<Veewave> Hello Interior_Gummy
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Everyone here liked it
<Aponymous> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/2e41775788547b6d170d34fe90bb929c/62835%20-%20Rarity_Applejack_Stoned_another%20bad%20meme%20pun_hopes%20this%20works_.jpg
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Spam chat such
<Natleyn> Pretty much everypony.
<Ziltoid> lol dat pic
<pony_854> :D
<Aponymous> Rarity was quite IGNEOUS.
*Veewave "kissed a girl and I liked it"
<Natleyn> Veewave: Okay then
<interior_gummy> seriously, it was way too rushed, and they basically trolled us by not having luna (which was foreshadowed for the last episode a billion times), discord went down too easily. it was funny, but they sort of half-assed it just like look before you sleep
<Veewave> :)
<Luna> 07,1hey everypony
<Purple`Prose> Hi
<Veewave> Hi
<DashWithRainbows> http://alicehumansacrifice1.deviantart.com/#/d4arr9z
<Luna> 07,1how was ep 2
<interior_gummy> meh
<DashWithRainbows> new background GET!
<Aponymous> Both episodes were too fast. I chalk it up to trying to put too much into 22 minutes.
<CriticKitten> This episode was written before Luna had exploded in popularity so much.
<Veewave> Nice
<Aponymous> Still enjoyable though.
<GabeMoist> Yeah, I thought Discord went down too easily
<CriticKitten> So it's kind of unsurprising Luna didn't show
<GabeMoist> Still pretty good though...
<interior_gummy> still, she's the co-ruler of equestria
<interior_gummy> you'd think she'd appear
<Flutterz> just finished watching cause I overslept, Luna -_-
<DashWithRainbows> @ Luna was worth the wait, i do not care what others say, it was still awesome
<Flutterz> but it was good
<Luna> 07,1i might willmat some point
<Flutterz> really good
<Aponymous> They're saving Luna for her own episode, I'm guessing.
<Luna> 07,1dear god irc on ipad is ugly
<CriticKitten> I think so, yeah.
<Purple`Prose> Well, the thing is, this was more 'End of season one' than 'start of Season 2'
<CriticKitten> It'd be better for her to get her own episode, too. More daw time.
<GabeMoist> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/be0b4ebff52b6074220a7be8653750f9/62830%20-%20starwars.jpg
<Natleyn> Yeah GabeMoist
<Natleyn> You go
<Natleyn> Whoo hoo
*Natleyn fluttercheers
<Luna> 07,1well back to the conference
<Veewave> bye
<Luna> 07,1see you guys later
<Flutterz> bye
<Revolver> bah Luna
<CriticKitten> Laters
<Aponymous> Later Luna!
<Luna> 07,1dont miss me too much
*Natleyn hugs Luna
<Natleyn> Bye :C
*Veewave misses Luna too much
<CriticKitten> Too late ;_;
<Aponymous> I won't miss you at all. trollface.bmp
<interior_gummy> obai luna
<Natleyn> http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/62843
<CosmicChan_> awww i missed luna :(
*Veewave cries and hugs pillow
<Natleyn> Aponymous: What, no scrunchyapplejack.png?
<CriticKitten> I was gonna say applejackpokerface.jpg myself :p
<GabeMoist> That was terrifying
<GabeMoist> Dose Buffalo
<Aponymous> I prefer Applebluff.png
<Natleyn> ^I like that better.
<herospirit> Hey thar
<CriticKitten> Agreed
*Natleyn glomps herospirit
<LordCelestia> I'm nback everyone
<Natleyn> YOU.
<Natleyn> Hello~
<herospirit> Ohai Nat
*LordCelestia waits for their glomp to end then GLOMPS HEROSPIRIT
<GabeMoist> Anyone gonna see the movies later?
<Aponymous> Ohai LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> ohai
<herospirit> Horrible night last night. Four hours of half awake nightmares, and then I barfed up all the contents of my stomache.
<LordCelestia> oh my god
<LordCelestia> whyd all that happen?
<Natleyn> Hero D:
<herospirit> Just sick.
<LordCelestia> :(
<herospirit> Still feeling ill, but a lot better than last night.
<Aponymous> I might watch Batman Begins later, you'd have to put a gun to my head to make me watch Babes in Toyland again though. And I'd probably still take the bullet.
<herospirit> Lol, Aponymous XD
<GabeMoist> lol
<Natleyn> Aponymous: I'm with this guy
<LordCelestia> herospirit did babes in toyland give you nightmares?
<GabeMoist> That :movie" was terribad
<herospirit> That could be part of it, LC. :P
<CriticKitten> I've never seen it myself, and I'm in good shape, so I could use a little mind warping
*Veewave sends "get well" via telepathetic brainwaves to herosirit
<Flutteryay> I always skip the B movie unless it's a good one. Like the Evil Dead movies or any b-horror.
<Flutteryay> Or a cult classic
*Natleyn hugs Flutteryay
<Natleyn> Flutteryay outta nowhere~
<GabeMoist> On the bright side, we can now endure any movie
*Flutteryay hugs Natelyn
<LordCelestia> And suddenly, flutteryay
<interior_gummy> so how was babes in toyland
<GabeMoist> since we endured toyland
<True_Discord> Endore Troll in Central Park
<Natleyn> GabeMoist: Maybe. If there's anything like that again....
<Aponymous> CriticKitten, you have no idea what you're getting into, for your soul, DON'T watch it
<LordCelestia> and WHY are there 125 people here but onyl a handfull of them are talking?
<GabeMoist> interior_gummy bad
<GabeMoist> run
<herospirit> Because this is bronystate.
<GabeMoist> run away
<AllisZero> It's like that all the time, LC
<AllisZero> Also herospirit, get well brah
<herospirit> Thanks AllisZero and Veewave
<CriticKitten> It's really that bad?
<herospirit> :]
<GabeMoist> yes
<GabeMoist> yes it is
<CriticKitten> Fantastic.
<Aponymous> Rock puns are best puns http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/041cf1512f23635c40cda33c9596d121/62844%20-%20%22YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH%22%20Rarity_Applejack_more%20another%20bad%20get%20gonna%20jokes_probably%20meme%20pun.jpg
<herospirit> No, it's bad in a bad way.
<herospirit> It's so bad that it's so good that it's terrible again.
<CriticKitten> So eye-bleeding bad rather than "lol, oh you"
<GabeMoist> indeed
<Natleyn> Aponymous: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e940851af6c3015f20584b6afcfe8454/62845%20-%20another%20applejack%20pun%20rarity%20rock%20yet.png ?
<GabeMoist> worse than Spider's Web
<Natleyn> GabeMoist: YES
<LordCelestia> LOL
<LordCelestia> new meme
<GabeMoist> I would rather watch Spider's Web
<LordCelestia> alert
<BigApplebloomJackSmi> oh mygod
<Aponymous> Mehpie outdid Tacowiz AND Bjornfot, I didn't think that was posssible
<BigApplebloomJackSmi> that
<GabeMoist> and THAT is bad
<BigApplebloomJackSmi> WAS FUCKIN AWESOME
<BigApplebloomJackSmi> W00000000T
<Aponymous> Yes Natleyn.
<Natleyn> I became mildly depressed because of Babes in Toyland.
<Natleyn> And then ponies and I was fine.
<CriticKitten> Four of those already? Man, are rock jokes turning into a meme now? XD
<Aponymous> Ponies helped a lot.
<DashWithRainbows> they will run out fast...
*Natleyn shrugs
<Aponymous> I'm waiting for an Igneous joke.
<pony_3669> epic episode
*Veewave helps Tom set up a rock band
<LordCelestia> Ponies: They are an antidepressant, morning stimulant, medical cure for just about everything, ultimate reaction picture generator, ultimate meme generator, perfect victim of dubbin and editing, and a weapon of mass destruction.
<GabeMoist> Rarity and Tom had a bit of a rocky relationship
<Aponymous> After that, I'll wash my hands of it.
<pony_3669> when's the next one delayed to
<pony_3669> ?
<MrPoniator> Two weekends without no new pony
<DashWithRainbows> in about 2 weeks
<MrPoniator> And supposedly after that, new ponies
<pony_3669> Hm not too bad
<LordCelestia> ^Whaddaya think?
<CorruptedDash> 2 weeks?? WHY???
<DashWithRainbows> we dont know
<MrPoniator> they're repeating the discord episodes

<Veewave> Well hello there little pony
*Natleyn pokes Fluttershy` with a hoof
<MrPoniator> Lol, these star wars comments
*Fluttershy` twitches
<MrPoniator> "Discord Star was blown up by Twilight﻿ "sparkle" Skywalker."
*herospirit checks the local pony thread
<herospirit> .....
<herospirit> http://s3.noelshack.com/uploads/images/8787574524663_fluttershy.jpg

<Aponymous> wat
<herospirit> He has more too
<pony_3669> XD
<DashWithRainbows> inside joke?
<pony_3669> Arrogance killed Discord
<DashWithRainbows> e.g. bird for brains?
*Veewave doesn't know what to do?
<MrPoniator> Pretty much
<herospirit> No, I think he's just random. XD
<Natleyn> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/4ae57dbf042bd191108f0338bbe81804/62855%20-%20Star_Wars%20applejack%20han_solo%20wink.png
<pony_3669> he didnt bother to notice they got their colors back...
<herospirit> his discription;
<herospirit> "Like that time when fluttershy was a birdcage ?"
<Natleyn> More Star Wars? Sure, wynaut
<pony_3669> Still I say he beat NMM by atleast 20 points
<Aponymous> Han Solojack?
<GabeMoist> Oh wow
<GabeMoist> the scene are more similar than I thought
<Veewave> I can't get the birdcage picture out of my head.
<CorruptedDash> HAHAHA! Apple Solo xD
<GabeMoist> Then there was Twilight looking at Spike
<Veewave> I need some seaponies
<herospirit> Another masterpiece one of the people over at the MSPA forum MlP FiM whipped up.
<herospirit> http://s3.noelshack.com/uploads/images/6268505416767_applejacks_hands.jpg
<MrPoniator> Yep
<GabeMoist> wat
<Natleyn> wat
<MrPoniator> He was a lot more enjoyable villain
<herospirit> And the description:
<pony_3669> Yeah
<Aponymous> Oh God What
<herospirit> "This new masterpiece I call it "Applejack's hoofs are now applejacks". The story behind it is that appeljack's hoofs are now applejacks. So she can't walk now because it hurt the applejacks. That makes her unhappy."
<CorruptedDash> WHAT THE HAY!? :O
<GabeMoist> wat
<pony_3669> she was more of a Cruela De'ville villain
<herospirit> Wat
<pony_3669> everyone was forced to hate her until she turned into Luna
<Ziltoid> wat
*Veewave can now not remember the birdcage picture
<herospirit> The artist should be hired by Hub, no?
<herospirit> His plot ideas are brilliant.
<GabeMoist> no
<Natleyn> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/f032772008c6eed8c97143ea3f7410d0/62859%20-%20tagme.png
<Natleyn> YES
<Aponymous> Ponibooru, y u so SLOW!
<Veewave> What would the plot be? Ponies on bad trips.
<herospirit> You know it Veewave
<Natleyn> Okay

<Aponymous> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/17424738ff75462423acd39335e93f48/62858%20-%20tagme.png

<CriticKitten> The other one works too, I suppose.
<Veewave> Has Bronydome lost interest in Drawball?
<hiding> Every picture I'm stalking on Ponibooru.
<CorruptedDash> how is that even possible to draw something like that in like two hours :O
<CriticKitten> At least it gives me another link to bother my friend with! :D
<Aponymous> It's John Joseco. Thats how.
<pony_3669> Woot :P
<DashWithRainbows> all John Joseco does is draw ponies
<Natleyn> Oh Joseco
<Natleyn> Why are you awesome and obsessed awesomely
<pony_3669> Gotta love artists like that
<DashWithRainbows> so hes really good at it and does it quite fast
*Veewave listens to Pony Swag
<pony_3669> and especially artists like that
<Natleyn> John rolls out of bed and into his drawing chair. :l
<pony_3669> and draws ponies
<pony_3669> for us to enjoy
<Natleyn> All the ponies
<DashWithRainbows> his bed is his drawing chair silly!
<pony_3669> Beds tend to be uncomfortable for that sort of thing...
<Veewave> BUT JOHN IS PONIES!
<Aponymous> He doesn't actually sleep, his existence is sustained by drawing.
<Aponymous> Specifically ponies
<pony_3669> Oh great, now he's the chuck norris of drawing
<Natleyn> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/fcce0cc2a7938185bdb55942ab847163/62863%20-%20applejack%20rarity%20umad.png
<Natleyn> Not a rock joke, but still
<pony_3669> She mad.

<Rainbow-Dash> Oops
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<herospirit> I wanna beat ponies with other ponies already! D:
<Aponymous> That game will be so cash, I hope Spike is in it.
<herospirit> They've confirmed there will be at least one non pony character.
<Aponymous> If it's not Spike, it better be Discord, if not him...
<Apokalipse> That comparison video betwen star wars and pony wars is blowing my mind
<Aponymous> I murder them all.
<Apokalipse> I didn't think it's that accurate

<Natleyn> I like this one best.
<Aponymous> Yeah, I figured
<herospirit> So.... that bumps up Spike's chances :p
<Aponymous> I hope it's not Gilda.
<herospirit> Really, the only two I can imagine it being are Spike and Gilda

<herospirit> Not what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin to the beat. And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet.
<Aponymous> So happy someone finally drew Screwball, hopefully the floodgates will open.
<herospirit> See, I. Am. Wondermic, and I'd like to say hello. A to the black, and the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow.

<Natleyn> Morning/Afternoon~
*VioletVanilla hugs Natleyn back~
*Revolver glomps VioletVanilla
<VioletVanilla> 06Hallo everypony!
<VioletVanilla> 06Ohmy!
<herospirit> But first, I gotta, bang bang, the boogy to the boogy, say upjump the boogy to the bang bang boogy
*VioletVanilla is glomp'd be Revolver as well~
<Revolver> :D
<Natleyn> And how are you today?
<Purple`Prose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G85M_CMim6M Wow, the fandom works fast o.o
<herospirit> Let's rock. You don't stop. Rock the rythym that'll make your body rock.
<VioletVanilla> 06Doing a lot better than earlier this week~
<Natleyn> Yay!
<herospirit> Well so, far, you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends a long. And next on the mic is my friend Hank, a come on Hank, sing that song!
<Aponymous> Celestia is now Chewie
<herospirit> Okay, I'm done now.
<VioletVanilla> 06Oh dear. . .
<CriticKitten> Ha, and as I expected, the "hold you down against your will" scene has been made into its own video. xD
<VioletVanilla> 06Chewbacca Celestia? o^o
<Natleyn> Critic, link?
<Purple`Prose> Link please?
<herospirit> I can't find a "Rapper's Delight" PMV. Someone must fix this.

<herospirit> Someone ponify it.
<herospirit> DO IT
<herospirit> FILLY.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ponify everything! Leave nothing unponified!
<DashWithRainbows> >been leaning on left shoulder while laying down since 12pm
<DashWithRainbows> >just got up
<Natleyn> DashWithRainbows: Numb much?
<DashWithRainbows> >HOLY SHIT THE FUCKING PAIN
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Sounds painful, pony
<Aponymous> I know that feel.
<Natleyn> I shift too much to know that feel.
<herospirit> RobotPinkie knows what he/she's talking about.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I do love me some ponies.
<herospirit> Ponify all the things....?
<Veewave> Ugh! There's this cat named Leo that comes by everyday and taunts my cats: It's really starting to tick me off.
<herospirit> Ponify ALL the things!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, name one thing that shouldn't be ponified... I dare you.
<Aponymous> Hmmm.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15(ponies don't count)
<Natleyn> Do we really need to go there, RobotPinkie
<Aponymous> The Last House on the Left.
<Natleyn> I can think of a bunch of unmentionable things, anyway
<Aponymous> Should NEVER be ponified.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh, well, I guess that's true.
<herospirit> Babes in Toyland
<Natleyn> A-
<Natleyn> Awww.
<herospirit> I WIN FOREVER.
<Natleyn> herospirit: THIS
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Babes in Toyland might have been bearable had it had ponies in it, though...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15....probably not, actually
<herospirit> Would you really put the poor ponies through that?
<Aponymous> I could see Ponifying the plot MAYBE working. But I highly doubt it.
*Natleyn feels terrible
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>ponifying the plot
<Natleyn> RobotPinkie: Lols.
<CriticKitten> Ha
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...I apologize.
<herospirit> Why Nat?
<interior_gummy> so everypony, what's the special event next friday?
<Aponymous> I put that in there just for you RobotPinkie. :P
<Natleyn> Thinking of what I was thinking.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not sure it's been announced yet.
<interior_gummy> ...can we have a hint?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I could tell you, but then I'd have to ban you from the entire intarwebs.
*Veewave is taking care of a cat
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So I won't :P
<i15770078> Hi?
<interior_gummy> does it have to do with ponies?
<Aponymous> Tell us, try to say no to THIS http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e81c0d64f592ac63f188594d527aecdc/62885%20-%20derpy_hooves%20pony_must_lick_pony%20screwball.png
<i15770078> Testing irc app
<RobotPinkie> 06,15screwball, is that her fanon name now?
<CorruptedDash> hi :)
<Aponymous> Yes.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Makes sense.
<DashWithRainbows> yep...
<Natleyn> It's on her flank....
<DashWithRainbows> saw cutie mark "her name is now Screwball"
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm guessing it's also the official name, really.
<DashWithRainbows> maybe
<Aponymous> Her appearance was probably the best 2 seconds of the entire show imo, and the show is pretty damn amazing.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I loved the opening 2 episodes of this season
<DashWithRainbows> wow... someone has already drawn a sketch of human screwball...
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131688214986.png
<Aponymous> Human Screwball already? I may need to give her her own folder soon at this rate.
<Natleyn> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/12126e69224bd40d38a7ff7f9b811df9/62897%20-%20applejack%20artist%3Aemlan%20big_macintosh%20human.png This has me in a giggle fit
<MrPoniator> yo
<Aponymous> WIN
<Aponymous> Been ninjad again, but still WIN.
<Aponymous> You are worthy Natleyn.
*Natleyn brohoofs Aponymous
*Aponymous brohoofs Natleyn
<herospirit> I'm going to find the most non-pony songs I can and Ponify them.
<herospirit> Example. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abJYXY3mPjs
<herospirit> Unless it's already been done.... Hmmm...
<herospirit> Nope, can't find a PMV of it.
<Apokalipse> Ponify an opera song
<Aponymous> Soon every song will have a Pony video. Even songs from Ponies.
<Apokalipse> It can be done
<Natleyn> I've already gone through four color revisions of this damn book, herospirit
<Natleyn> Whyyyyy
<herospirit> Also I want to PMV some "Your Favorite Martian" songs.
<Aponymous> I approve of Pony Opera.
<herospirit> NAAAAAAAAT :[
<Apokalipse> Actually pony opera's been done before
<herospirit> Try finding a picture of Twilight with a book
<Apokalipse> except it had some epic not so opera at the end
<herospirit> And steal the colors.
<Aponymous> Really?
<Natleyn> I was gonna ask if the turret song from portal counted.
<Purple`Prose> Question: would Celestia's use of the scrolls count as a Batman Gambit?
<Apokalipse> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5u7so6UvRg
<Apokalipse> That's the opera I was talking about
<herospirit> Oh, for the YFM songs, I specifically want to ponify "My Balls" and "Orphan Tears" :P
<Natleyn> Purple`Prose: I'd say yes
<Natleyn> 'cause it supports Trollestia.
<herospirit> "Batman Gambit"?
<Natleyn> "You six ponies are Equestria's only hope!" -lets them go off as they will-
<Aponymous> A Batman gambit is a plan hinging on them doing EXACTLY what you want them to do, that could easily be destroyed if they don't. So yes, I think so. Twi could have easily ignbored the scrolls and left town.
<Natleyn> Wait.
<Natleyn> I'm going back to see if they started making Star Wars references earlier
<Apokalipse> I wonder if a good flamenco song PMV is possible
<Aponymous> I recall somepony saying "I have a bad feeling about this" in one episode. And that line is in every Star Wars thing ever so.
<herospirit> Guuuuys. When Pony Emblem is finished you'd best play it. :I
<Natleyn> I will play the hay outta it.
<herospirit> I'm not making these portrait sprites for nuffin.
<Aponymous> Pony Emblem? Like Fire Emblem? DO WANT
*herospirit hugs Natleyn.
<Natleyn> Hero, I'll load that onto a flash cart so I can bring it around with me
<Natleyn> I need a flash cart first, but they're not hard to get...
<Aponymous> More Rock jokes http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/23a029874a04759d44c168fd27a7e378/62906%20-%20rarity%20stoned%20tom%20twilight_sparkle.jpg
<herospirit> Yesh Aponymous, it's a hack of the rom for the Fire Emblem on GBA
<herospirit> I joined the art team for it :D
<Aponymous> Awesome. I didn't know there was a Pony Emblem romhack going on, I'll keep an eye out for it.
<herospirit> It'll probably be a long time though. They just put together the art team like a week or two ago.
<Aponymous> I'm patient, I'm still waiting for the Samurai Jack movie.
<herospirit> They had a competition. I got second place, so I get to design an OC to be one of the bosses.
<Natleyn> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/4d370ee9628b9ef7618b42ce326af95e/62908%20-%20big_mac%20eyup%20lick%20no_shipping_just_cute%20twiligth_sparkle.png
<herospirit> And... Samurai Jack movie? WHAT? :0
<CosmicC> Test
<CosmicChan_> damn mobile irc
<CosmicC> I think its finally working
<Aponymous> It's been in development for years, something to wrap the series up. Last I heard was two years ago they got JJ Abrahms I believe to be the producer.
<CosmicC> Thank god
<herospirit> Do Want.
<Aponymous> John Joseco is AWESOME http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/b5760e07ad4cc47fd7bf0b24a0353e01/62911%20-%20artist%3Ajohn_joseco%20spike.png

<CosmicC> Yesssss it works :D
<Natleyn> What works?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol yeah, I'm guessing a lot of people noticed the Star Wars similarity.
<DashWithRainbows> IRC app for his phone
<Natleyn> RobotPinkie: There are at least 3 good videos about it already
<GabeMoist> Spot the error:
<DashWithRainbows> i never watched star wars
<GabeMoist> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3025e629346a77277755a182717cbd1c/62902%20-%20animation_errors%20rarity%20what_i_watched%20why_does_it_have_three_arms.png
<DashWithRainbows> never will
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Really? Wow
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Link, maybe?
<Natleyn> Uhhh.
<Natleyn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G85M_CMim6M here's one.
<DashWithRainbows> i see it!
<DashWithRainbows> rarity has no eyelashes
<Natleyn> There's another one with them side by side
<Aponymous> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4wh4FnwiAg
<Natleyn> ^
<Natleyn> Thank you Aponymous :3
<GabeMoist> Rarity without eyelashes is funny lookin
<DashWithRainbows> she looks so wierd...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks <3
<GabeMoist> Apparently Twilight is Luke
<GabeMoist> Applejack is Han
<GabeMoist> Celestia is Chewie
<Aponymous> Spike is C3-PO
<DashWithRainbows> i can see this being a meme
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131688250460.jpg
<Natleyn> Aponymous: Not r2d2?
<Natleyn> Hiya ValtheJean
<AllisZero> Lol
<Natleyn> :3
<Natleyn> And in comes AllisZero as well
<ValtheJean> 2,14 L.O
<AllisZero> Thank you!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay, ValtheJean
<Aponymous> Eh, Either or, he does fit R2 better though, come to think of it.
<DashWithRainbows> hey ValtheJean and AllisZero :3
<AllisZero> Oh hai everypony
<AllisZero> RP!
<GabeMoist> I want to see fanart of Applejack piloting the Millenium Faclon
<Aponymous> Ohai ValtheJean and Alliszero
<AllisZero> I've been devising an e-mail for my company for about an hour
<AllisZero> It's glorious
<Natleyn> Oh?
<AllisZero> Then I'll work on my shirt design on Illustrator
<Natleyn> Still working on this bloody book cursor.
<AllisZero> We quadrupled our bandwidth last night
<AllisZero> So I'm letting everyone know
<AllisZero> I think using "everypony" in my e-mail might not be very professional
<AllisZero> But maybe if I use a strikeout...
<DashWithRainbows> yes it is...
<DashWithRainbows> ponies are always professional
<Natleyn> I'mma do Fluttershy's cursors last, 'cause moving butterflies is gonna be hard.
<Aponymous> It's the HEIGHT of professionalism. :P
<Natleyn> AllisZero: Did you start the letter with "Dear Princess Celestia..."?
<AllisZero> Oh god
<AllisZero> That would ACTUALLY be very funny
<DashWithRainbows> someone done that before
<DashWithRainbows> found out that their teacher was a brony
<DashWithRainbows> wish that would happen for me....
<Natleyn> I saw a rage comic where someone did that, and apparently their superior responded with "My Faithful Student..."
<herospirit> lol
<Aponymous> I heard that story once.
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131688421960.png
<DashWithRainbows> spot the animation error
<AllisZero> Doing that NOW
<DashWithRainbows> GO!
<Flutteryay> ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
<Natleyn> DashWithRainbows: Guards are being all "Dat flank"?
<DashWithRainbows> the statues actually
<DashWithRainbows> guards become statues...
<Aponymous> The statue guards?
<AllisZero> Plot twist
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't blink
<Natleyn> I figured that was it, but dat flank is funnier :3
<GabeMoist> so...no pre-show?
<herospirit> I'm gonna go pass out for a bit.
<herospirit> Head hurts, can't focus on the screen.
<herospirit> Bleh.
<herospirit> Cyas
<Natleyn> feel better soon, hero ;~;
<GabeMoist> bai
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<DashWithRainbows> bye herospirit !

<Aponymous> More best pony!
<Natleyn> Because Big Mac as a dog ain't gettin' old any time soon
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/62915
<DashWithRainbows> what is this? i dont even....
<Natleyn> DashWithRainbows: The hat?
<Aponymous> I actually didn't care much for Big Mac until he turned into a dog.
<AllisZero> LLUL SHOULD I DO IT
<Natleyn> Eugh, the hat thing.
<DashWithRainbows> it looks wierd
<AllisZero> Dear Princess Celestia Destination Rewards,
<AllisZero> Princess Celestia has a strikethrough
<DashWithRainbows> go on...
<Purple`Prose> Laters
<Natleyn> Seeya Purple
<DashWithRainbows> you should send that in the email
<DashWithRainbows> bye purple
<Aponymous> Later PurpleProse`
<AllisZero> Should I?
<AllisZero> Or should I not
<Natleyn> I'd do it, but if you're adding more stuff, I'd only do the Princess part
<AllisZero> More stuff like?
<Natleyn> Once might be funny and excusable, but personally I'd get annoyed and make the feeling known if there were more pony references.
<DashWithRainbows> finish with the "from your faithful student (strikethrough if you need to)
<Natleyn> In a business email, anyway.
<DashWithRainbows> and your name
<AllisZero> I usually crack jokes in all my emails, it's all in good fun
<Natleyn> Oh.
<Natleyn> Good on you, then xD
<AllisZero> That's why I would even consider this, everyone usually thinks my emails are funny
<Aponymous> I was gonna say don't do it, but if you usually throw jokes in, go ahead.
<AllisZero> Due to the magic of load balancing, we now have about four times the bandwidth of before, so your web services should load smooth as butter even during times of high traffic.
<AllisZero> Should I say "magic of friendship" and strike it through, instead of Dear Princess etc?
<AllisZero> More subtle :p
<Natleyn> -shrugs-
<AllisZero> Eh, whatever
<Stonegaze> Hi.
<Natleyn> There are 3 more Screwball pictures on Ponibooru.
<Natleyn> Two are low quality
<Natleyn> Hiya Stonegaze

<ValtheJean> 2,14 you know, I'm starting to dislike screwball
<ValtheJean> 2,14 she's taking the rightful place of Derpy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and that is nut gut
<Natleyn> I love this fandom's instant creativity.
<Natleyn> I like Screwball, but she's more the discord-y wacky kind of pony that I never wanted Derpy to be, so...
<Natleyn> No conflict imo.
<Natleyn> Or rather, in my eyes.
<Aponymous> I don't think I need to say anymore about Screwball than I've already said.

<DashWithRainbows> JTeeth: its because my family always checks recent saves and downloads so i cant do shit,

<CosmicChan_> choclate rain is a good thing =D
<DashWithRainbows> unless i have my flash drive then i can
<JTeeth> just be like "so? deal with it" lol
<GabeMoist> Be stealthy

<niriall> so why is it not playing?
<niriall> Are we in the wrong room?
<JTeeth> oh yeah that sucks
<niriall> The synchtube one seems empty as well

*Flutterguy doesn't have properly working audio at the moment.

<RobotPinkie> 06,15I want a girl with a short skirt and a loooooooooong jacket.
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey guys.
<VioletVanilla> 06And Hallo LunaTheForgotten!
<SuperBrony64> Luna: It's okay, you don't need to take your jacket off on our account.
<Ghosties> 04Why thank you, Val
<Natleyn> VioletVanilla: I'm stuck between FFVI, FFVIII and I wanna try FFIX :<

<Ghosties> 04Why?
<Mata> thanks
<Ghosties> 04What's he gonna do, make fun of it?
<Veewave> It already did
<Natleyn> Violet, oh you.
<Mata> darn
<Ghosties> 04People have been doing that for years
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because it's one of the few things that can bring tears to my eyes :P
<Veewave> Check out Youtube
<Natleyn> ValtheJean: Wynaut
<Natleyn> Oh.
<Ghosties> 04Huh, I see
<Mata> nothing yet
<LunaTheForgotten> Is there a stream right now?
<Veewave> It's already up
<SuperBrony64> VioletVanilla: It's okay, I'm wearing red socks…quite comfortable.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15FFX is probably the best FF, though I still hold some weird nostalgic attachments to FF7
<Mata> damn I should get sober already^^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just play the ending theme music, and I'm like a little girl who had her dolly stolen
<Luna> 07,1yes there is...
<SuperBrony64> Only because they are the color red…which is for FIRE
<VioletVanilla> 06;3 Superbrony64 that sounds lovely~
*Pegacorn regains consiousness
<Luna> 07,1just not a regular place
*Luna takes her jacket off
<Ghosties> 04I also enjoyed VIII
<Veewave> That might help
<ValtheJean> 2,14 8 was awesome
<VioletVanilla> 06Dat jacket~
<SuperBrony64> Luna: Don't do it! The internet is a cold place!!
<Veewave> :]
<RobotPinkie> 06,15FF8 was great, except the draw system was too tedious
<CosmicChan> full of trolls D:
<SuperBrony64> You'll get a pneumonia.
<Luna> 07,1this community is warm
<Luna> 07,1:)
<VioletVanilla> 06c:
<Luna> 07,1I mean ponies what more can a girl wish for
<SuperBrony64> Luna: BAAAAAAWWWW *tear in eye*
<ValtheJean> 2,14 phfff, the draw system was easy if you did it right
<CosmicChan> =D
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just card a few mods, card refine. Boom. You're done
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mobs*
<Natleyn> SuperBrony64: Fire socks? I'm jelly
*Pegacorn stands back up
<VioletVanilla> 06Lava socks Natleyn, even better~ o:
<Natleyn> ValtheJean: <3 VIII
<VioletVanilla> 06PEGACORN DETECTED
<Natleyn> Lava socks... @.@
<SuperBrony64> Natleyn: You bet, every step is a new degree of burns.
<CosmicChan> hey pegacorn is back =p
<VioletVanilla> 06PONYPOUNCE INITIATED
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Easy? Yeah, but it took unnecessarily long.
*Revolver tackles Pegacorn for fun
<LunaTheForgotten> Lava socks sound too hot.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 8 is a great story. And It bothers me that everyone complains how "emo" Squall is, and yet drool over that idiot Cloud
<Luna> 07,1is it still lagging?
*VioletVanilla ponypounces Pegacorn~
<DashWithRainbows> not much lag
<Luna> 07,1good.
*CosmicChan glomps pegacorn again
<Ghosties> 04Not to mention Sephiroth
<VioletVanilla> 06Sephiroth is a cutie~
<Ghosties> 04Fans eat them up
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Kefka > Sephiroth
<VioletVanilla> 06You are just jelly~
<Luna> 07,1we might switch again to the mane room after the movie.. but I did not want to keep you waiting
<Veewave> Hit the #bronystate tab below your chatbox
<SuperBrony64> Oh dear, a window is telling me my system doesn't support a plugin needed to play the video that is playing in the background...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 What does Sephiroth do? Stabs a few Hippies
<VioletVanilla> 06Luna is victorious!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Kefka destroys the entire balance of the god damn world
<RobotPinkie> 06,15FF8 had a much better story than FF7, yeah. FF7 just had a lot more fun stuff to do in the world.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh, and becomes god
<SuperBrony64> Luna: We are not worthy!
<CosmicChan> noooo the stream froze for me D:
<LunaTheForgotten> My stream is just not loading.
<Revolver> Boone is still the best
<Natleyn> Kefka is OP
<Natleyn> Only reason you even win is because he got bored
<Luna> 07,1Luna go here: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
<Mata> Yes I saw that, thanks^^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<SuperBrony64> CosmicChan: Refresh it.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't like Sephiroth fanboys, but you do realize that he does a lot more than that, I hope...
<Veewave> np
<Mata> I finally found it on YT
<Pegacorn> GET OFF OF ME vv!
<Revolver> again
<Revolver> Boone
<Pegacorn> *VV
<Revolver> Still Best
<RobotPinkie> 06,15He's just a boring character.
<SuperBrony64> SuperBrony64 likes to talk in the third-person as well.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 feh, he kills a few nobodies. the rest of the story is how god damn emo Cloud is
<LunaTheForgotten> Thanks Luna:)
<Veewave> Better late than never, right?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 "Oh, Imma blow up the earth" - fails miserably
<Luna> 07,1your welcome
<VioletVanilla> 06Cid from FF7 is SOOO hot though!!! <33
<ValtheJean> 2,14 whereas Kefka actually fucking DOES it
<CosmicChan> nooo chrome froze
<Luna> 07,1we might switch back after this movie
<Luna> 07,1just so you know
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Because how well written a character is depends on how much of the planet he blows up :P
*DashWithRainbows grabs a wet teabag and throws it a Pegacorn "you know what just happened to you...?"
<Revolver> are we talking about the same things?
<Pegacorn> ?
<DashWithRainbows> you just got teabagged :3
*Pegacorn vaporizes the teabag
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Well I'm just saying that since Sephiroth is such a bland character, we only have his actions to go off of
<SuperBrony64> SPOILER: Someone in this movie becomes Batman.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which, is pitiful
<Luna> 07,1Sorry guys & girls
*Veewave Pegacorn's been teabag'd. ey?
<Ghosties> 04Is the stream frozen for anybody else?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 whereas Kefka is a delightful villain :P
<Luna> 07,1I just got home.. from a conference
<VioletVanilla> 06ish tay~ :3
<Luna> 07,1had no idea we had tech issues...
<Mata> Might I ask you if you know a good YT channel for episodes?
*VioletVanilla hugs Luna tightly
<GabeMoist> SPOILER: Batman dresses as a bat
<Bjornfot> hey brownies
<LunaTheForgotten> SuperBrony64,No WAY!
*DashWithRainbows runs with arms flailing randomly
<Ghosties> 04Ah, I'm good
<CosmicChan> ghosties: me
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, he DOES become god at the end, too, that's kind of a common thing in Final Fantasy :P
<Ghosties> 04Just refresh
<Bjornfot> why is the stream not loading?
<Mata> right now I only found a rather choppy one
<Revolver> That's why Ulysses is just an awesome antagonist
<Luna> 07,1we will switch back after batman most likely
<Revolver> I mean
<Luna> 07,1for now this is the best I can do
<Ghosties> 04REFRESH, I SAY
<SuperBrony64> Just enhance and zoom in the stream.
<EspyLacopa> Someone mentioned Kefka?
<Ghosties> 04Val did
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that would be me
<CosmicChan> hey its back =D
<Bjornfot> but i just DID refresh
<VioletVanilla> 06And your best is all that we expect. :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Kefka= Best villain
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I do think FFX has a much better story, though
<Ghosties> 04FFX was like an experience
<EspyLacopa> What would happen if Kefka and The Joker met?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Bjornfot, http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
<Ghosties> 04I didn't just play the game
<Veewave> Not really
<Ghosties> 04I experienced it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 FFX was the highpoint of Final Fantasy games
<CosmicChan> ghosties: invent an autorefresher D:
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, it really was
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and since then it has only degraded
<SuperBrony64> Heath Ledger is best villain.
<Revolver> He goes and attempt to launch a Nuclear Missile at the Long-15 to take down the NCR and to get pay back at The Courier
<VioletVanilla> 06FFX had an epic beginning song. . .
<Natleyn> 11 had good music. <3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Espy: the universe would implode
<Ghosties> 04I'm only one ghost, CosmicChan :O
<Revolver> nope
*LunaTheForgotten brohoofs SuperBrony64
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have some issues with the American voice acting in FFX, but otherwise it's amazing
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: But yet your name is pluralized....
<Veewave> The mods might help in the main chat
<Ghosties> 04Don't let the name fool you
<CosmicChan> ^ what he said
<Revolver> Ulysses is Best Villan ValtheJean
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Biggest FF game ever, pretty much.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I actually really liked the VAs in 10
<Mata> kk^^
<Ghosties> 04I'm like an inverse of Ermac
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but then again, Bender as Wakka is rather awesome :P
*SuperBrony64 brohoofs LunaTheForgotten back
<DashWithRainbows> lol i have no idea whats being discussed as i have never played final fantasy :D
<Ghosties> 04Whereas he is multiple people in one body with one name, I am simply one ghost with a pluralized name
<Stonegaze> When is the stream going to start?
<VioletVanilla> 06yfw I can perform music from every FF game~
<Pegacorn> Bjornfot is back?
<Luna> 07,1Stonegaze
<Pegacorn> YAY
<CosmicChan> ok its laggy for me, time to play pokemons ant wait for it to be fixed, and talk in irc ^^
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: Then…you are the essence of pure evil?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Violet: RECORD IT FILLY
<Stonegaze> sup
<Luna> 07,1stream is up at: http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=SaturdayNightLive
<Ghosties> 04How do you figure?
<DashWithRainbows> CosmicChan: what pokemon you playing....
<Revolver> I can perform the original music from all Fallout games
*VioletVanilla already recorded Terra's Theme.
<CosmicChan> finishing black =p
<ValtheJean> 2,14 <3 Terra's theme
<CosmicChan> then playin emerald ^^
<DashWithRainbows> i has black but i need to find my DS charger
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: I don't know…took me years of research to figure it out.
<LunaTheForgotten> I wish I had a butler like Alfred.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm actually really glad for this FFX remake though
<GabeMoist> Ghosties: http://www.atom.com/blog/files/2009/10/ghost.jpg
<DashWithRainbows> i love you right now CosmicChan as that is my favourite pokemon game
<Ghosties> 04Nah, it's not me. It's some other ghost or something
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I need to get FF6 for the GBA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because my FFX disc is broken, so now I can just buy the remade version
<CosmicChan> it was my first one =3
<SuperBrony64> GabeMoist: OMG Rarity's Ghost!!
<CosmicChan> still my fav as well =D
*Veewave is viewtiful joe
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I hope the FFX HD version isn't just on PSN :(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and your worst is still better than my best :(
<DashWithRainbows> just needs to be redone like soul silver was but include stuff from black e.g. your pokemon moves during battle
<Stonegaze> Why the stream isn't being shown here on BronyState?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That would piss me off so much...
<Revolver> Ulysses, Still Best Villain EVAR
*VioletVanilla took a minute to learn Otherworld from FFX
<Ghosties> 04It's gonna be on both Vita and PS3
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: Actually, it's PS3/Vita Exclusive.
<Ghosties> 04So I imagine it's gonna be disck
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the hell is Vita?
<CosmicChan> i bet they will remake emerald for 3ds =3
<VioletVanilla> 06I just did it for you Val~
<Luna> 07,1We are looking into that stonegaze
<DashWithRainbows> @ Stonegaze because it was really laggy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 <3 violet
<Luna> 07,1this was the best we could do for the moment
<SuperBrony64> ValtheJean: Dear God…The Playstation Vita...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Doesn't really mean it'll be on disc, but we'll see
*ValtheJean has no idea what that is
<DashWithRainbows> @ CosmicChan i wouldnt like it on 3DS
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I sincerely hope so
<Ghosties> 04That is true...it may only be digital like RE4 was
<SuperBrony64> ValtheJean: :(
<DashWithRainbows> would be pretty bad, as alot of users get headaches
<Bjornfot> does anyone of you have acces to the website?
<SuperBrony64> Don't do it Bruce!
<CosmicChan> aww, i dont mind the 3d on it
<Ghosties> 04When RE4 HD was released in Japan, it actually got a physical disc, where in America and Europe it was digital
<Bjornfot> you could just replace the iframe yaknow
<CosmicChan> got mine first day havent had a hedache, but i know some people do
<DashWithRainbows> yep lets justt walk down a dark alleyway

<SuperBrony64> Oh come on, some of you must get the reference
<Veewave> Bruce Wayne is best Billionaire
<Ghosties> 04nope.jpg
<Veewave> u mad
<Ghosties> 04My post directed at SuperBrony64's
<Veewave> o
*SuperBrony64 throws Ghosties copy of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'
<GabeMoist> SSSSSSsssssssssssssssssssss
<Ghosties> 04OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Ghosties> 04That book
<Ghosties> 04Good story...completely forgot about it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15We're not that cultured, geez.
<Pegacorn> GABE IS CREEPER
<LunaTheForgotten> Ohhhhhhh, I get it know,SuperBrony64
<LunaTheForgotten> *now*
*ValtheJean is now very sad for this chat
<GabeMoist> Bruce Wayne stumbled across a cave filled with Batmans
<Ghosties> 04Bah, don't worry Val
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lawl
<Ghosties> 04I still remember classics
<GabeMoist> TheStartled Batmans flew around him
<SuperBrony64> Hurray for books!
<GabeMoist> Then he became Batmanman
*Veewave does not tend to acknowledge things
<Ghosties> 04Like An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and The Yellow Wallpaper
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I only remember the ones I've read.
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie:…I wouldn't expect anything less...
<LunaTheForgotten> I haven't read that book in ages.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The implication that just because you haven't read one "classic" book you've read nothing else is silly.
<SuperBrony64> The villain of this movie is none other than…BOO RADLEY!
*Veewave is not the goddamn Batman
<Veewave> just thought you'd like to know
*Pegacorn Bat-punches Veewave
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I was SURE you were the goddamn Batman, though.
<Veewave> *biff*
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey guys,if you could have any super power, what would it be?
<SuperBrony64> Transform into a Pegasus.
<SuperBrony64> Yeah, I said it.
<DashWithRainbows> to be able to teleport myself to equestria..
<DashWithRainbows> mines better :3
<Ghosties> 04Why hello thar, God
<MeteorVenture> the power to have my comments always be read and replied to when i want in any given chatroom
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Being a pony in Equestria would be my superpower.
*Veewave would want electric powers
<ValtheJean> 2,14 *Cartman voice* The power to have all the powers I want
<SuperBrony64> DashWithRainbows: We'll work together.
<Ghosties> 04What are you doing working in Applied Sciences?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...that's a super power, right?
<MeteorVenture> see the usefulness?
<LunaTheForgotten> The powers of Hiro Nakamuro from heroes.
<SuperBrony64> ValtheJean: YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT POWER! I'm the freakin' DM here!
<Natleyn> Transformation into a pegasus pony. :0
*Pegacorn has the same power as ValtheJan
<GabeMoist> I would have the ability to travel between dimensions
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The power to roast people in the belly of a dragon.
<Pegacorn> *ValtheJean
<SuperBrony64> Ouch
<SuperBrony64> I feel…violated.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 We are Harbinger...we are the dawning of your evolution
<GabeMoist> I would tear open a portal to Eqvestria
<MeteorVenture> lol now i'm wondering if anyone actually did read my comment o.o
<Veewave> I changed my mind; I wanna be able to be ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<SuperBrony64> GabeMoist: The German version of Equestria? Your wish is my command.
<GabeMoist> Photo Finish's homeland
*Natleyn hugs MeteorVenture
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Actually no, the power to teleport every single blu ray set of seasons 1-230 of MLP:FiM from the future to my living room.
<Natleyn> ^This
<SuperBrony64> Spray painting a black suit black...
*MeteorVenture is thankful
<LunaTheForgotten> Good one RobotPinkie.
<MeteorVenture> friiiiiiiends
<Ghosties> 04Bad move, Robot. Everyone knows FiM goes downhill after Season 198
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well yeah, but I'm a collector, Ghosties :P
<Ghosties> 04I see
<LunaTheForgotten> This is where I came in last night.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Now now Ghosties, you can't forget that classic episode with Caramel saving the worled in Season 213, everyone said it was the best episode ever
<Pegacorn> .....Wait a minute.Where did Bjornfot go?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 world* even
<Ghosties> 04Really?
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: Your wish is my command, except they don't come out till they create a new Region lock that will only play on Blu-Ray players located in United States of Russia.
*Veewave killed Bjornfot
<Revolver> no ValtheJean, it sucked
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Darn...
<Ghosties> 04I remember people calling Caramel coming in as a poorly implemented excuse for a deus ex machina
<GabeMoist> Episode 23 of season 219 was the best ep
<Ghosties> 04And Dari was very adamant against it
<Pegacorn> VEEWAVE YOU BASTARD!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, but no one complained because everyone loved Caramel so much that they voted he become the new Celestia
<LunaTheForgotten> The gun is now a stapler.
<Bjornfot> am i the only one who still likes season 42? :C
<SuperBrony64> GabeMoist: That was the one where Spike finally gets Rarity as his girlfriend. Good episode.
<Pegacorn> BJORNFOT YOU'RE NOT DEAD!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think that's when the show jumped the shark, really.
<Pegacorn> YAY!
*Veewave is getting away with Bjornfot's T.V.
<The_Si> What about the 2 parter where Granny Smith took on the Smooze horde?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I mean voting in Equestria?
<LunaTheForgotten> I like season 23 episode 18. It's a classic.
*VioletVanilla is so confused~
*Veewave is goin' ghost
<Bjornfot> nah pegacorn, only half dead
*Pegacorn shoots Veewave in the head with The Ambassador
<Revolver> No, ValtheJean, that's the episode where he gets killed
<VioletVanilla> 06MOSTLY dead, but not all dead~
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: No voting in Equestria. Princess Celestia makes any and all decisions alone.
<LunaTheForgotten> The first episode we see Luna in.
*VioletVanilla waits for people to get her reference~
<Revolver> fuck the trident
*Veewave can't bother to be killed right now please try again later
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I know, SuperBrony64, that's why the voting in of Caramel as the new ruler was a bit too much for me.
<DashWithRainbows> dat wing boner
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but that's what began the great Revolutionary War of Equestria
<Revolver> and Caramel got killed by both sides
<ValtheJean> 2,14 where soon freedom, equality, and muffins were given to ponies of all sides
<SuperBrony64> I wish I could use that material to make a new and improved Rainbow Dash costume.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't make me ban you revolver
<Bjornfot> S105E14 was awesome, when Rainbow Dash finally came out as a fillyfooler
<Pegacorn> Bjornfot,I NEED ANWSERS.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15All we are saaaaaying.... is give Caramel a chaaaaance
<SuperBrony64> Bjornfot: lol
<SuperBrony64> Oh boy!
<Bjornfot> uh oh...
<Natleyn> Yay videos!
<Bjornfot> ummm, yes, pegacorn?
<LunaTheForgotten> Ponies and Scrubs.AWESOME

<Bjornfot> no, it was actually pretty lame
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: If that wasn't a troll comment if I ever did see one :P
*Veewave mounts Pegacorn
<Bjornfot> so i'm not gonna tell it again
<Bjornfot> :D
<Bjornfot> ...AND NOPONY ELSE WILL TELL HIM
<MeteorVenture> >made that up >had to say it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You've never seen me make a troll comment before, SuperBrony64? :P
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: Quite literally.
<SuperBrony64> *troll face*
<Natleyn> You keep using that word. I do not think you know what it means.
<SuperBrony64> Inconceivable!

<GabeMoist> literally
<Crickettwb> Oh, right. This is the European stream?
<SuperBrony64> That stands, quite literally, for "be right back". I coined the phrase and acronym itself.
<DashWithRainbows> yes Crickettwb
<Apokalipse> I just came on. Is it just me or is the stream still a bit choppy?
*Veewave is unaffected and leaves Bjornfot to figure out why
<SuperBrony64> RobotPinkie: Quite adamantly.

<MeteorVenture> hey guys look! i found secret butt fun at the vet http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4599956544_b26cae2951.jpg
<DashWithRainbows> these custom ponies look awesome
<Pegacorn> OMG
<AllisZero> I don't think I was made to work with vector graphics
<DashWithRainbows> @ Pegacorn i used to but the disc broke :(
<Natleyn> MeteorVenture: Haha
<GabeMoist> equestriadaily
<Natleyn> Why not Allis?
<Pegacorn> I have L4D2 on Steam.
<MeteorVenture> i found it by searching "give a dog a loan" in google images
<GabeMoist> ....
<DashWithRainbows> had it on xbox, all DLC. completly love the game
<MeteorVenture> not very many related jokes popped up surprisingly
<scatr> having all the chats spread out like this for movie night is weird
<SuperBrony64> I don't get why they think Batman is the villain...
<AllisZero> Not sure Nat, it just feels clunky to use
<AllisZero> Of course it's because I don't know how to use it yet
<Natleyn> Ahh.
<Revolver> hey Silvermane
<scatr> had a quick look round and people are spread out, most of the theatres are a bit quieter than htis
<AllisZero> But never really managed to work well with it
<Veewave> Bluh, umad?
<scatr> no, just confused, i'm used to things being pretty lively in here so it's weird that people are spread oout
<Veewave> Go to the main chat.
<Pegacorn> Ohai Allis
<scatr> (unless there isn't actually a move on tonight)
<scatr> what's the channel for main chat?
<Veewave> The #bronystate tab
<DashWithRainbows> #bronystate
<GabeMoist> I gotta get me one of those
*Veewave wins
<AllisZero> Hey Pega
<Veewave> :P
<DashWithRainbows> >took his time
<AllisZero> How's it going/ Haven't seen you in a while
<MirthTinker> SILVERMANE!
<CriticKitten> SuperBrony64: They don't. But vigilantes, especially ones who damage property and such, are generally frowned on
<Revolver> XD
*MirthTinker glomps

<SuperBrony64> Combustiblelemons: Nope, still going.
<Ghosties> 04If you had your pick, what should I get. Force Unleashed 1 or Force Unleashed 2? Keep in mind that I've already beaten the first one.
<SuperBrony64> Later Pegacorn
*RobotPinkie hands Veewave a large tuna instead
<SuperBrony64> Force unleashed 2
<DashWithRainbows> bye Pegacorn !!!
*Natleyn hugs Pegacorn goodbye
<SuperBrony64> You just said you beaten the first one, so why get it again?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Second one if you've already beaten the first, I guess.
<Ghosties> 04Because I've heard the second one is much worse
*Veewave can't lift that unreasonably-sized tuna
<RobotPinkie> 06,15First one is better, yeah.
<SuperBrony64> I'd get Super Mario Galaxy 2 instead.
<Combustiblelemons> have we picked a movie yet?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not sure why it's only a choice between those games, though, can't you get something else?
<Ghosties> 04So what say the chat?
<Crickettwb> Yeah, but why waste money? Get the second one and see how it is for yourself!
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: Super Mario Galaxy 2
<Ghosties> 04I could get something else, but I kinda had my mind on those two. Also, I don't have a Wii
<DashWithRainbows> good, the wii is dead
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: Then we know the answer to this debate...
<Natleyn> Combustiblelemons: For next BMN?

<Veewave> I put the large tuna in the cannon
<SuperBrony64> Get Halo Combat Anniversary :P Ghosties
<Veewave> beyetch
<DashWithRainbows> i can fly in space = easily dodge

<GabeMoist> do eet
<VioletVanilla> 06;3
<Luna> 07,1We would like your input
<Sumica> oh dear i think my cold is acting up again.
<SuperBrony64> How about we just watch "The Santa Clause"
<Bjornfot> no ghosties
<herospirit> Whoever chose Babes in Toyland should win an award
<herospirit> He defeated Bronystate
<Bjornfot> i wasn't here for that yesterday
<SuperBrony64> Ghosties: I'm all for Disney version.
<Natleyn> herospirit: This
<ValtheJean> 2,14 let's make this clear: the decision is show the new one, or NOTHING. You aren't picking between this one and the one we showed last night
<Combustiblelemons> There should be a rule on B movies
<Bjornfot> i wanna see what all teh fuzz is about
<Natleyn> NO CHANCES
<Luna> 07,1there is from now on
<Bjornfot> o
<Combustiblelemons> a b movie must be somewhat watchable.
<Sumica> How about i show appleseed luna =p
<Natleyn> I'm fine with no movie.
<Bjornfot> y
<VioletVanilla> 06Either the Disney version, or no second movie.
<Bjornfot> why not?
<SuperBrony64> Oh, well, how about Nothing and we just stream requests?
<Ghosties> 04We're never showing the remake
<Ghosties> 04Ever
<Ghosties> 04Never again
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because it's so god damn awful
<Bjornfot> don't you have it or something?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it is physically painful to watch
<Luna> 07,1Alright no B movie
<Bjornfot> but i wanna see it
<Ghosties> 04So it's either the Disney version or PMVsx
*VioletVanilla deleted it off the hardrive of the person she downloaded it from.
<Bjornfot> i missed it yesterday
<Ghosties> 04*PMVs
<GabeMoist> Let's do eet
<DashWithRainbows> PMV!!!
<herospirit> No you don't Bjornfot
<Combustiblelemons> PMVs.
<Natleyn> PMVs!
<Luna> 07,1and no... we still have the pony eps left
<Bjornfot> yea
<Combustiblelemons> No question about it.
<Luna> 07,1including season 2 ep 2
<RobotPinkie> 06,15:O
<DashWithRainbows> Ghosties: that was a bit idiotic asking between Toyland and PMV's wasn't it?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15omg
<Combustiblelemons> what dash said.
<Bjornfot> aww come on mods, y u so flankhurt
<Ghosties> 04We felt the chat was the better entity to make the decision
<Bjornfot> it couldn't hav been THAT bad
<klaxa> ugh
<herospirit> IT WAS,
<klaxa> way too colorful in here
<Ghosties> 04Bjornfot, it was so bad it was bad
<Bjornfot> prove it
<The_Si> So was Lisa dead all along?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 bjorn, you're welcome to watch it on your own time
<herospirit> IT WAS THAT BAD AND WORSE.
*Veewave is a happy pony without Babes in Toyland
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but the decision was made last night
<Combustiblelemons> it was worse than spiders web.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and we're sticking with it
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It could, Bjornfot, just download it and watch it.
<Combustiblelemons> it truely was.
<Natleyn> Bjornfot: I became depressed for the length of that movie
<Bjornfot> or are you gonna force me to download it and watch it by myself?
<Ghosties> 04So, PMVs I guess
<SuperBrony64> The Disney version is up on YouTube
<CriticKitten> Ah well.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we aren't forcing you to do anything
<Combustiblelemons> yep, sorry bjorn.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if you download that atrocity, it's your own damn fault
<Sumica> hi derpy
<Combustiblelemons> for your own safety, don't watch it
<Bjornfot> well i simply must see what allt eh fuzz is about
<CriticKitten> I've never seen it and likely never will, so no loss there. xD
<Bjornfot> and how i can beat it
<The_Si> I stopped watching it because it was 4am and I didn't want to miss MLP.
*Veewave watches ninjas
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No it's not "so bad it's funny" or something, Bjornfot, it's just bad
<DashWithRainbows> Veewave: impossible
<DashWithRainbows> no one can see them
<Ghosties> 04It's so bad it's bad
*Veewave is not impossible
<Bjornfot> i still don't like that i'm not teh most hated anymore
<Combustiblelemons> So the B movie rule is it can't be so bad it's bad.
<Ghosties> 04There is no good
<Bjornfot> i thought G1 MLP was unbeatable
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, lawl
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would GLADLY watch G1 over it
<Combustiblelemons> g1 mlp wasn't as bad.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would gladly watch G3.5 OVER IT
<RobotPinkie> 06,15inb4 Bjornfot wins B movie in two weeks time
<Combustiblelemons> nowhere near as bad.
<Bjornfot> but next time you better prepare your anuses for G3.5
<ValtheJean> 2,14 THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS
<The_Si> G1 had the Smooze.
<Ghosties> 04Okay, for one, Babes was 2 hours and 20 minutes long
<Natleyn> I'm with ValtheJean on this
<Ghosties> 04SERIOUSLY
<The_Si> This had...
<Luna> 07,1Alright BRONIES we are switching back
<Natleyn> IT WAS LIKE LORD OF THE RINGS, EXCEPT BAD
<Natleyn> IT JUST KEPT GOING
<Natleyn> AND THEN WE THOUGHT IT ENDED
<Natleyn> BUT CD2
<Combustiblelemons> Lmfao XD
<Natleyn> D:
<Luna> 07,1the stream will go down now
<GabeMoist> I'll watch Spider's Web, G1, G3.5 simultaneously while reading spiderses over it
<Diftraku> lol
<herospirit> What Gabe said.
<Ghosties> 04I pleaded for the movie to stop
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hell, I'd rather read a clopfic staring Caramel over it
<The_Si> CD2 = Despair Event Horizion.
<Ghosties> 04I've never asked for that
<GabeMoist> It's true
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and I'm dead fucking serious
<VioletVanilla> 06ohmy~
*Veewave is distracted
<EspyLacopa> Don't forget the Harry Potter fanfic, "My Immortal"
<VioletVanilla> 06Val would clop to Caramel o:
<Bjornfot> we can fix that, valthejean
<Veewave> ...by ninjas
<Combustiblelemons> It was like watching a car crash in slow motion
<EspyLacopa> So bad, it got deleted from Fanfiction.net
<VioletVanilla> 06THIS IS CANON
<Diftraku> Bashing that!
<Combustiblelemons> you wanted to look away but couldn't.
<Bjornfot> who wouldn't?
<Combustiblelemons> Just to see the disgrace in the chatroom made my night
<RobotPinkie> 06,15*slow clop*
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanilla
<GabeMoist> clop clop clop
<herospirit> That movie was like watching paint dry.
*VioletVanilla has the logs of it.
<herospirit> Except the paint was vomit.
<Combustiblelemons> I wonder if the makers of that movie commited mass suicide afterwards.
<Luna> 07,1and we're back up
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Watching paint dry is infinitely more entertaining.
<DashWithRainbows> dude...
<GabeMoist> I'd rather wtahc Manos
<DashWithRainbows> paint trying is so INTENSE!!
<herospirit> But RobotPinkie
<DashWithRainbows> drying*
<scatr> ha, forgot i even had this window open. then, suddenly, derpy out of nowhere
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Manos is hilariously bad
<GabeMoist> At least Manos has Torgo
<herospirit> There is NO METAPHOR capable of describing the AWFUL.
<Luna> 07,1http://www.bronystate.net/theatre
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Indeed, GabeMoist, and his goddamn KNEES
<GabeMoist> He has his own walking theme
<Bjornfot> hey, where did pegacorn go? i'm alive now...
<herospirit> Have we seen kill bill in here yet?
<herospirit> It's so awful.
<DashWithRainbows> he left Bjornfot quite a while back
<Bjornfot> D:
<Combustiblelemons> If aliens watch a movie from our planet, I pray to god the first they see isn't babes in toyland.
<Bjornfot> DANGIT
<GabeMoist> I wonder if Nostalgia Critic would watch it?
<Bjornfot> I NEED MY PONYCEPTION FIX
<VioletVanilla> 06Went to play Garrys Mod Bjornfot
<Bjornfot> brb clopfics
<Combustiblelemons> I think the aliens would burn our cities to the ground and burn them again.
<Sumica> manos the hands of fate?
<herospirit> brb
<DashWithRainbows> o_o
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii2rPRq6N34&feature=player_embedded

<The_Si> I'd wash your hair if I were you, Fluttershy.
*Veewave want
<Combustiblelemons> other than fluttershy?
<TheMaster> with all these sci-fi references lately. I wonder if we'll get more trek/star wars stuff in later eps
<herospirit> Pinkie knows.
<TheMaster> or maybe even battle star galactica
<herospirit> She knows all.
<CosmicChan> super brony: did u just make AHF refrence? =p
<TheMaster> cylon ponies
<GabeMoist> bbrrrrrrrr
<CosmicChan> ATHF*

<Sumica> Hard to say TheMaster, keep in mind 201 and 202 were made at the end of last years eps.
<herospirit> Dash is not amused.
<Natleyn> GENTLEMENTLEMEN
<Combustiblelemons> A little 18th century if you ask me.
<TheMaster> That just makes it all the more obvious the writers are total nerds
<SuperBrony64> CosmicChan: Quite literally.
<herospirit> Eat them. EAT THEM.
<Natleyn> And Ladies.
<DashWithRainbows> @ SuperBrony64 younger gen watching MLP FiM? your such a silly filly!

<GabeMoist> troll the trolls
<TheMaster> I think the new hope reference was great, any adults watching with their kids would have lol'd
<Combustiblelemons> lol spike
<SuperBrony64> No Mac, I don't want a report on me force quitting Google Chrome...
<TheMaster> like the beatles ppg episodes

<Combustiblelemons> Dash has an awesome house.
<DashWithRainbows> Has a mansion
<TheMaster> she probably built it herself, she can control clouds
<DashWithRainbows> Sleeps outside
<EspyLacopa> Makes me wonder what other massive references that Season 2 will have in store for us.
<CosmicChan> Rainbow dash =3
<The_Si> Her bikini zone!
<EspyLacopa> They started off with Q and Star Wars.
<Luna> 07,1ewwww

<TheMaster> less dramatic
<Luna> 07,1fling spring marathon :o
<Natleyn> inb4pinkie'ssuperfastgoingbackwards
<SuperBrony64> Oh boy! I didn't know we were watching a marathon.

<Ghosties> 04Oh my god, StarsFull from Civ III. So good
<TheMaster> what about civ3?
<DashWithRainbows> seriously Twilight Sparkle has a spell for anything = Over-powered much?
<TheMaster> most of her spells don't work
<DashWithRainbows> still knows them...
<DashWithRainbows> still over powered
<TheMaster> well she is like, the most talented magical pony bar celestia/luna
<Combustiblelemons> what if they started eating them? D:
<EspyLacopa> Your Twilight Sparkle cursor set is missing a "Working in Background" cursor.
<The_Si> Discord would be proud.
<Combustiblelemons> well, they didn't eat their crops.
<GabeMoist> No Parasprite
<Combustiblelemons> HOW.... WHAT...
<GabeMoist> You are the words
<TheMaster> what these ponies need is some Klingons. Parapsirtes hate klingons
*DashWithRainbows could really go for some words right now
*Veewave seconded
<EspyLacopa> Who did the Twilight Sparkle animated cursor icons?
<SuperBrony64> inb4 Twilight snap
<DashWithRainbows> Natleyn did....
<Combustiblelemons> twi finally snapped...
<GabeMoist> induring twilight snap
*Natleyn raises a hoof
<EspyLacopa> Yo, Natleyn, your cursor set be missing the "Working in Background" cursor.

<herospirit> Dat face
<DashWithRainbows> Celestia "what the fuck?"
<CosmicChan> lol love this part
<Diftraku> "Hit much traffic?"
<Natleyn> In general, most people don't need to differentiate between the two, EspyLacopa, but I could work on one.
<TheMaster> Celestia seems to always have her wings flaired
<EspyLacopa> Is it basically just an animated gif style image?
<DashWithRainbows> because shes a bawws
<herospirit> Constant wing boner?
*EspyLacopa cracks open the GIMP.
<Natleyn> EspyLacopa: Yeah, pretty much.
<Natleyn> Not sure if that'd work, but if it does, lemme know
<Sumica> Oh right how is the cursor set coming along?
<Luna> 07,1Also

<herospirit> Nat, since we "Dungeons and Ponies" together, your new nickname is Nat 20.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because Rarity/Fluttershy or RD/AJ are obvious pairs
<EspyLacopa> To go with my NMM background and Chrome theme.
<Natleyn> I used that as my nick during one campaign herospirit
<Applebloom> superbrony64: there doing fine actually :)

<Sumica> each clap had a diffrent sound
<TheMaster> maybe a sound board with the mane cast
<Veewave> The Fellowship has failed.
<interior_gummy> speaking of princesses, why the hell was luna missing in this episode? isn't she co-ruler?
<CosmicChan> inb4 monochrome twilight
<Luna> 07,1oh no :(
<SuperBrony64> Poor Twilight :(
<TheMaster> because she was obviously cleaning up the rest of equestria
<Sumica> I hope that sound board thing luna has gets updated with discord.
<GabeMoist> wat
<Crickettwb> Aww. . . . NOOOOO
<TheMaster> after discords mess
<SuperBrony64> Screwball time!
<DashWithRainbows> ohai screwball!
<herospirit> We need an alternate ending where Discord wins.
<herospirit> :0
<EspyLacopa> I almost wish that this two-parter episode had been a three-parter, and give more time to bringing the others back to their senses.
<Luna> 07,1ROFL
<TheMaster> there will be fanfics herospirit
<TheMaster> don't worry
<herospirit> :D
<TwilightSparkle> lol
<FriendshipCannon> <3 Discord!
<EspyLacopa> Instead of. . .Twilight Learned Vulcan Mind Meld! It was Super Effective!
<CosmicChan> so much fanfic
<CosmicChan> soooo much
<Applebloom> yeah, exactly but twilight cheated
<TheMaster> this really could have made a amazing movie
<interior_gummy> this episode was way too rushed and discord went down too easily
<Ghosties> 04Discord isn't so much a bad guy as he is just...well...chaotic neutral
<herospirit> DISCORD TURNED HER NEW HOME INTO SOAP!
<interior_gummy> should have been a made-for-tv movie
<Sumica> yeah this would have been a great movie
<TheMaster> he's chaotic evil
<herospirit> I agree completely Gummy.
<Sumica> Chaotic random perhaps
<Rainbow-Dash> Discord turned the moon into swiss cheese
<Combustiblelemons> poor spike- I know that feel.
<TheMaster> chaotic selfish omnipotent god
<TwilightSparkle> inb4 I knew a friendship Spell.
<Ghosties> 04He really should have been a supporting character that occassionaly follows Twilight around and gives comedic feedback and provides antics
<Crickettwb> I sympathise with spike.
<CosmicChan> i love this part
<interior_gummy> tbh, this and look before you sleep were the worst episodes
<EspyLacopa> Discord grabs a cotton candy cloud, uses it to refill his glass with chocolate milk, drinks the glass, then throws the milk over his shoulder. Whereupon it explodes.
<FriendshipCannon> Best part
<Sumica> So you want him to be Q Ghosties ?
<Thunder_Dash> I agree, with both Ghosties and Gummy, xcept that I didn't think this was a bad ep
<Ghosties> 04I want him to be Sheogorath
<Crickettwb> FREAKING DUH TWILIGHT
<Thunder_Dash> *except
<EspyLacopa> MLP already has a Shoggoth. THE SMOOOOOZE!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 <3 Sheogorath
<Natleyn> Sheogorath. xD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Shivering Isles was an amazing expansion
<Sumica> FOR PONY!
<CosmicChan> epic twilight pose
<Rainbow-Dash> Sheogorath.
<TwilightSparkle> FOR EQUESTRIA!
<Rainbow-Dash> Ruler of madness
<Luna> 07,1rofl
<Luna> 07,1wtf
<CosmicChan> big macindog
<Veewave> Cuhthuga is best elder god
<Applebloom> flying pigs XD
<interior_gummy> big molentosh
<Diftraku> Dog Mac <3
<Natleyn> PONY FOR THE PONY GOD
<FriendshipCannon> Dog Macintosh!
<interior_gummy> i fight for my friends
<CosmicChan> anyone notice how aj reverse eat the apple?
<NewDCD> and then a million TwiMac fics were born
<Sumica> Rape!
<EspyLacopa> Where does Sheogorath come from?
<FriendshipCannon> Da Magics!
<SuperBrony64> Dis music...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Elder Scrolls
<TwilightSparkle> im awesome
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the Prince of Madness
<CriticKitten> Applejack's thinking: "Uh, Twi? Your horn's touching me....
<Ghosties> 04He's a Deadra
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Sworn enemy of Jyggalagg
<herospirit> No you're not, dude don't lie.
<Ghosties> 04Daedra
<EspyLacopa> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoggoth <-- I prefer this.
<Ghosties> 04And Jyggalagg is the Daedra of Order
<interior_gummy> bondageshy
<Rainbow-Dash> Dont piss Sheogorath off, unless you want a rather unpleasant freefall..
<CosmicChan> lol
<Pegacorn> BONDAGESHY?
<SuperBrony64> Let us never speak of this again...
<Luna> 07,1dumb rock!
<Pegacorn> LOLWUT
<CosmicChan> GET AWAY FROM TOM
<interior_gummy> rip tom
<Thunder_Dash> DUMB ROCK
<herospirit> FACE THE JUDGEMENT OF....
<TheMaster> or they banished him to the everfree forest
<TheMaster> not a shoggoth
<TheMaster> sheoggorath from oblivion
<TheMaster> CHAOS FOR THE CHAOS THRONE
<TheMaster> or friendship for the friendship throne
<TheMaster> so really, twilight just does the reverse of discord
<TheMaster> forcibly mess with her friends minds
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I know the best reward! CHEESE FOR EVERYONE! Well...unless you don't like cheese...in that case, CHEESE FOR NO ONE!
<FriendshipCannon> I TURNED GREY! HAHAHAHAHA!
<herospirit> JYGGALAGG!
<TwilightSparkle> inb4 that's nice
<Ghosties> 04Actually
<TheMaster> what? i don't recall typing so fast
<Ghosties> 04Now that I think about it...
<Sumica> RainbowDash: Cool story Bro.
<SuperBrony64> inb4 Applejack owning Rarity
<Ghosties> 04Pinkie Pie is like the pony version of Sheogorath
<Combustiblelemons> I love how she says awesome
<FriendshipCannon> Appletroll is best pony.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh fun little note
<TheMaster> honesty doesn't mean you can't troll
<ValtheJean> 2,14 when RD loses her loyalty
<ValtheJean> 2,14 she becomes Gilda
<herospirit> Soooo....
<Luna> 07,1rofl
<CosmicChan> fluttershy makes my day here
<Pegacorn> Gilda is BAWS
<Luna> 07,1flutter
<CriticKitten> Best line ever
<interior_gummy> "rainbow dash, can i rape you?"
<herospirit> Why didn't Discord just teleport away before being painbow'd?
<Combustiblelemons> cloud monorail
<Rainbow-Dash> Herospirit, what do you think of this episode?
<Pegacorn> interior,may you shut up.
<FriendshipCannon> Epic balloon chase
<Luna> 07,1this is amazing
<Luna> 07,1I love this ep
<herospirit> I like it, but it was rushed.
<TheMaster> because then he couldn't lose and the episode couldn't have ended
<Combustiblelemons> wonder why she doesn't change direction
*CosmicChan agrees with luna very much
<Rainbow-Dash> Pegacorn, dont shun other peoples creativity. XD
<interior_gummy> YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SECURE THE RAP
<Turgle> yes but Discord was toooo passive
<FriendshipCannon> flutterrage time!
<Combustiblelemons> after all, its hard to change direction on a ballon
<Thunder_Dash> what herospirit said.
<CosmicChan> fluttershy is so freaking awesome
<interior_gummy> flutterrage
<herospirit> I agree, these two episodes should have been a movie.
<EspyLacopa> shuuuuuun
<GabeMoist> Sonic Flutterboom
<Turgle> herospirit, indeed
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and people were worried S2 wouldn't be as good :P
<Turgle> :D
<interior_gummy> it wasn't so far
<Luna> 07,1huuuug
<interior_gummy> part 1 was great, part 2 was a massive letdown
<TheMaster> i liked this ep quite a bit.
<Ghosties> 04We won't really know until the third ep
<Combustiblelemons> up to this point I thought it was good
<TheMaster> insta wingboney
<herospirit> Well gummy, remember S1E2?
<Ghosties> 04Since this was made at the end of S1
<Combustiblelemons> it's this part I think could do with revising.
<Turgle> he drink the glass xD
<Pegacorn> RD?HOLY GODDAMN.
<TwilightSparkle> inb4 chocolate boom
<EspyLacopa> Oh man, extended edition of the Season 2 opening, as a full-blown movie.
<Turgle> i love this guy
<EspyLacopa> Imagine it.
<TheMaster> people apparently expected a massive, unstoppably huge battle.
*Pegacorn bows before RD
<Sumica> Law of anime there
<Combustiblelemons> explosive chocolate milk ftw.
<interior_gummy> herospirit: yes, but i didn't join the herd until june
<Luna> 07,1bubble :o
<CosmicChan> i like how this played out actually
<Rainbow-Dash> Erm.. Are you talking to me or the actual character?
<Turgle> yay bubble!
<NewDCD> 9 Guys
<Rainbow-Dash> Pegacorn*
<NewDCD> 9 Guys
<Applebloom> wow explosive chocolate milk was awesome
<NewDCD> 9 I figured something out
<Turgle> Guys
<Thunder_Dash> Hi DCD
<CosmicChan> hey DCD
<herospirit> I just wanna know why Discord just sits here and takes it.
<TwilightSparkle> RUN RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
<Combustiblelemons> ohai dcd
<NewDCD> 9 It's enver explained who spammails via Spike
<FriendshipCannon> lol he's so cocky
<Turgle> see?
<Diftraku> inb4 rarity car alarm
<TwilightSparkle> TELEPORT AWAY!
<NewDCD> 9 It's assumed to be Celestia...but wouldn't that feel unnatural for her?
<VioletVanilla> 06Dat attack~
<Turgle> why he isn't doing ANYTHING
<GabeMoist> Ohai DCD
<DashWithRainbows> its obvious thats its celestia
<Sumica> They said celistia did it DCD
<EspyLacopa> I think it's because Discord isn't aware that the others fully recovered.
*Natleyn hugs NewDCD
<TheMaster> maybe he's bound by his own nature to be overconfident
<herospirit> Discord was smarter than this earlier.
<Luna> 07,1what the...
<SuperBrony64> Hey NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9 Nay, my mind has come to the conclusion...that it was LUNA who sent the letters, not Celestia
<GabeMoist> pew
<GabeMoist> Sonic Flutterboom
<EspyLacopa> After all, last time, he /did/ just sit there.
<GabeMoist> pew
<Ghosties> 04PEW PEW PEW
<GabeMoist> pew
<Turgle> TASTE THE RAINBOW
*FriendshipCannon fired
<GabeMoist> pew
<CosmicChan> taste the rainbow motherfucker!
<GabeMoist> pew
<VioletVanilla> 06Neigh~
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but celestia is already a confirmed troll
<Combustiblelemons> Discord DGAF.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 one or two letters would have been more than enough
<TwilightSparkle> NOOOOOOOOOO!
<Sumica> He should have put his shades on.
<Luna> 07,1too soon!
<SuperBrony64> inb4 Star Wars ending
<Luna> 07,1TOO SOON!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 instead, she kept sending them to the point of inflicting pain on spike
<Turgle> moral of the episode: friendship is magic
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that spells troll to me
<VioletVanilla> 06NOT SOON ENOUGH!
<Natleyn> herospirit: until the rainbow actually worked, it looked exactly the same as their failed attempt
<Thunder_Dash> induringstarwarsending
<CosmicChan> lol star wars ending
<TwilightSparkle> Cool Reference
<Applebloom> star wars ending
<ValtheJean> 2,14 que star wars music
<GabeMoist> inb4 DCD sings
<VioletVanilla> 06lol
<SuperBrony64> Nerd-gasm
<NewDCD> 9 Celestia would know the effects on Spike. Actually, that brings forward another point: the reports on Friendship? They serve a double function, and one of them is educating Luna on Friendship before she can feel comftable with the New Equestria
<Natleyn> herospirit: Also, he calls them frenemies, assuming they're still angry at each other.
<herospirit> Except they weren't grey anymore, Natleyn
<Ghosties> 04LUNA SENT THEM
<Ghosties> 04THAT'S WHO DID IT
<herospirit> :0
<EspyLacopa> Maybe Discord is color blind.
<Combustiblelemons> overall, discords final fight could have been made into something more than an "okay I'll get turned into stone again"
<Luna> 07,1dat heroism
<Rainbow-Dash> Your wrong Ghosties
<Natleyn> herospirit: yeah, but he didn't notice that.
<Rainbow-Dash> Philomena sent them
<CosmicChan> this made me feel so awesome to be a brony
<TheMaster> just wait till the continuation "Discord Strikes Back"
<EspyLacopa> Who knows how Discord's mind works.
<herospirit> How could you... not notice that...
<EspyLacopa> He's /Discord/
<TheMaster> celestia never told you about the elements
*Luna cries no Luna
<Ghosties> 04But Philomena is just one bird
*Natleyn shrugs
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and then Discord becomes Twilight's real father
<TheMaster> she told me enough! she told me you stole them
<CosmicChan> oooo now what we gonna watch luna?
*Natleyn hugs Combustiblelemons
<TwilightSparkle> TwilightSparkle is gonna miss discord
<Ghosties> 04HOW CAN ONE BIRD HAVE SO MUCH POWER
<Combustiblelemons> ^_^
<NewDCD> I SHALL TAKE OVER
<NewDCD> AND USE ZA POWA
<TheMaster> No...you are the elements
<GabeMoist> Twilight stole the elements
<interior_gummy> i know you can't do much of an epic battle, but at least have him last a bit longer, and have the transformation sequence back to normal
<EspyLacopa> No no. Discord. . .is Twilight's real MOTHER!
<DashWithRainbows> its celstias pet Ghosties
<Rainbow-Dash> Its magic Ghosties, I dont have to explain shit :P
<FriendshipCannon> GLORIOUS
<interior_gummy> longer
<DashWithRainbows> celestias*
<herospirit> I demand a redo! Someone wake up Discord!
<Pegacorn> NO ONE BIRD SHOULD HAVE ALL DAT POWAH
<Luna> 07,1hmm the battle was a bit too short
<CosmicChan> love the streams =3
<interior_gummy> so in other words, this couldn't work as a 22 minute episode
<golfcourse> hilariously quiet theatre
<Combustiblelemons> Fight the power!
<golfcourse> perhaps it's just rarity
<golfcourse> w/e thanks bronystate
<Applebloom> start a argument and he will come back
<golfcourse> bronycon was awesome
<interior_gummy> should have been a feature length film
<TheMaster> are you going to stream something else?
<GabeMoist> RETS GO RETS GOKAIGER
<EspyLacopa> Quick, someone get the Cutey Mark Crusaders!
<Ghosties> 04Don't forget that the "battle" with Nightmare Moon was also short
<golfcourse> also, whoever can go to new york comic con should go
<Turgle> this battle needs at least 4 eps
<TheMaster> twilight didn't even activate her bankai
<TheMaster> pff, lame
<interior_gummy> Ghosties: yeah, but the setup to it in the everfree forest made it better
<golfcourse> regardless rarity is still best pony and theatre
<Luna> 07,1I would have loved a little more chaos
<Turgle> ^
<Nightfall_Shimmer> Nightmare Moon also actually tried fighting back =/
<interior_gummy> in this one, they simply walked into ponyville
<Combustiblelemons> so would I
<Ghosties> 04And there was setup here
<GabeMoist> Then Twilight befriends Discord Nanoha style
<interior_gummy> and killed him
*Natleyn brohoofs golfcourse
<Natleyn> Aww yeah.
<Ghosties> 04All it amounts to is a subjective opinion
<Combustiblelemons> 3 episodes of discord would have been alright imo
<CriticKitten> Nightmare Moon fought back? Huh?
<Ghosties> 04Most people preferred Nightmare Moon
<Combustiblelemons> the first half seemed rushed
<CosmicChan> streamception!!!
<TheMaster> STREAMCEPTION
<Luna> 07,1all over :P
<Thunder_Dash> ohai youtube
<Applebloom> discord can't beat nightmare moons butt anytime :D
<GabeMoist> SNUGGLY WUGGLY
<Combustiblelemons> meh i'll stop complaining
<herospirit> Lol, the second recommended vidoe
<herospirit> video*
<NewDCD> Woona
<CriticKitten> She stood there and got toasted by the rainbow too, what "fight back" exactly? O.o
<Nightfall_Shimmer> Nightmare Moon and Twilight charged eachother head first. Twilight just activated the EoH before she could do anything else.
<NewDCD> 9 I'm ready
<Luna> 07,1alright
<EspyLacopa> Discord almost got away with it, if it weren't for that meddling troll princess!
<Natleyn> SNUGGLY WUGGLY
<Rainbow-Dash> The videos recommended to you are based on what you search for
<Luna> 07,1DCD is taking over
<TheMaster> and discord tried to forcibly pull all her friends to him.
<interior_gummy> so yeah, this was meh, but i liked it a little better the second time
<Rainbow-Dash> Luna
<Luna> 07,1you folks have a nice night
<Rainbow-Dash> What have you been watching
<NewDCD> 9 Just for a little while though
<Ghosties> 04See ya, Sath
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see ya woona
<CosmicChan> by luna!!!
*Natleyn hugs Luna goodnight
<EspyLacopa> G'night LUna.
<Combustiblelemons> DCD, do an improvised entertainment again soon :D
<Natleyn> Thanks Luna!
<Apokalipse> bye Luna
<Rainbow-Dash> Night Luna
<Applebloom> discord better than nightmare moon :)
<Thunder_Dash> Bye Luna
<herospirit> night Luna
<Combustiblelemons> and bye luna!
*Fluttershy` glomps Luna
<interior_gummy> bye luna
<FriendshipCannon> night Luna
*CosmicChan hugs luna
<CriticKitten> Later Luna!~
<TheMaster> bye luna
<interior_gummy> hopefully you appear in season 2
*Veewave waves goodbye to Luna
*Apokalipse demands improvised entertainment
<TheMaster> see you in a few episodes
<NewDCD> 9 And we're live
<NewDCD> 9do you get signal?
<interior_gummy> also, they trolled us by not having luna in this episode
<CosmicChan> yup
<DashWithRainbows> ywa
<TheMaster> main screen turn on
<Ghosties> 04Set us up the bomb
<DashWithRainbows> yes*
<Combustiblelemons> we copy loud and clear./
<interior_gummy> she was mentioned a million times
<EspyLacopa> Release all Zig!
<Diftraku> All your base are belong to us
<interior_gummy> and never appears, even though she's the co-ruler
<TheMaster> hello gentlecolts, all your ponyville are belong to us
<CosmicChan> wuts this
<NewDCD> 9 You do. NOW LET'S GO FULL RETARD
<TheMaster> ...I have no idea what this it
<Natleyn> YES
<CriticKitten> This episode was written before the fangasm over Luna. :p
<TheMaster> but it looks like magical girls
<Natleyn> Now what is this
<Combustiblelemons> >is not an anime fan.
<NewDCD> 9 Nanoha.
<interior_gummy> she's still the co-ruler, so why would she not appear?
<Rainbow-Dash> One of my friends just said R34 Paheal is down, and people are blaming the MLP S2 Premier
<Diftraku> NewDCD: What anime is this?
<Rainbow-Dash> LOL
<The_Si> HUEG EYES
<Combustiblelemons> *gets heavily flamed(
<NewDCD> 9 AKA: MAGICAL GIRLS POWERED BY HOT BLOOD AND MECHA TROPES
<Applebloom> what if that vision that applejack had was maybe true you never know
<Pegacorn> TAKE OFF EVERY ZIG
<Combustiblelemons> night everyone!
<NewDCD> 9 IT'S LIKE I'M WATCHING GURREN LAGANN WITH MAGICAL GIRLS
<TheMaster> so...anime my little pony?
<Luna> 07,1sound is gone
<CosmicChan> anime??? awww
*Natleyn hugs NewDCD
<Natleyn> AWWWW YEAH
<Combustiblelemons> sounds fine for me
<NewDCD> 9no sound?
<Veewave> uh... derp derp. Y no Robuts?
<Luna> 07,1and fixed
<TheMaster> i'd have voted for doctor who, but i'm a hopeless fanboy
<DashWithRainbows> still got sound here
<NewDCD> 9oh okay
<Luna> 07,1was on my end
<CriticKitten> Better question: why would she? She's been imprisoned for a thousand years and hasn't experienced the world in all that time.
<Combustiblelemons> goodnight everyone :)
<DashWithRainbows> goodnight Combustiblelemons!
<Veewave> Good night
<interior_gummy> because she theoretically is supposed to co-rule with celestia?
<Applebloom> goodnight combutiblemons :)
<CriticKitten> I'd figure she'd be out exploring the world she's been so removed from, and learning about the power of friendship that helped save her.
<CosmicChan> night lemons!
<Rainbow-Dash> Guys
<MrChang> hero
<DashWithRainbows> oui?
<Rainbow-Dash> R34 Paheal is down, and people are blaming the MLP S2 Premier
<NewDCD> 9 God someone should make a Nanoha parody with ponies. It's the only natural conclusion. THEY ARE MANLY SHOWS FOR MANLY MEN.
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<CriticKitten> Yeah, but when she tried to get moon duties back, Celestia sent her TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAA.
<CosmicChan> DCD i issue you a challange, change my views on anime =p
<MrChang> get your spoony ass in the session
<MrChang> lets go
<Bjornfot> NEWDCD! WOO!
<Veewave> Why do magical girls need wands?
<TheMaster> why do ponies need friendship?
<DashWithRainbows> why do men watch a girls cartoon?
<EspyLacopa> To channel. . .da magicks!
<Rainbow-Dash> Why does Discord need an umbrella?
<DashWithRainbows> why does spike not have a moustache?
<Applebloom> for utter chaos XD
<Ghosties> 04WHERE WAS GONDOR
<Natleyn> Hey NewDCD
<DashWithRainbows> these are the questions we must know!
<Natleyn> Do you like Fate/Stay Night?
<Apokalipse> I do
<EspyLacopa> I do not.
<Jimmy> ....What is this?
<Ghosties> 04CosmicChan, what's your opinion on anime?
<MrChang> silver!
<NewDCD> 9 Never watched it.
<MrChang> psst!
<CosmicChan> not a very good one =x
<Rainbow-Dash> Herospirit is gone.. :(
<Ghosties> 04Why not?
<CosmicChan> not a fan
*Veewave let is get away
<MrChang> i need your help to be a NPC!
<interior_gummy> so all in all, this episode disappointed me, but compared to the rest of tv it was decent
<Natleyn> NewDCD: It's really just a bunch of GAR.
<Jimmy> Herospirit is here.
<Veewave> it*
<Jimmy> RIGGGHT HEEEEERE
<Rainbow-Dash> >.>
<CosmicChan> idk i never really liked it thaat much, idk why
<NewDCD> 9 Anime is cartoons made in Japan. One should judge on the individual basis rather than on a so-called "genre" in general
<CosmicChan> used to bore me, this one looks cool tho
<EspyLacopa> Fate Stay/Night bored me to tears.
<MrChang> anime is ass, bro.
<Ghosties> 04Hmm
<TheMaster> I prefer Berserk
<MrChang> too many high school, perverted stuff
<Applebloom> I didn't like that much either, because it doesn't make sense when the CMC caused discord to break out in the first place
<Ghosties> 04You should watch Cromartie High School. I'm not a fan of anime much myself, but Cromartie is unbelievably good
<EspyLacopa> MrChang: You should go watch Usagi Drop.
<interior_gummy> damn hasbro probably limited it to two episodes so that they could show more PINK BABY PONIES
<NewDCD> 9 MrChang: I hate those shitty shows, but not all animu is that
<Applebloom> and they never showed up
<MrChang> y'all should go watch Gintama
<MrChang> most down to earth anime
<MrChang> ever.
<Jimmy> What NewDCD said.
<Bjornfot> sooo what's this? it seems awfully girly
<CosmicChan> hmm
<NewDCD> 9 Gintama is too fucking long
<MrChang> its the ONLY one i watch
<Ghosties> 04Everything Japanese is girly
<Ghosties> 04...wait
<EspyLacopa> Just like almost everything, about 95% of japanese cartoons is crap.
<Ghosties> 04No
*Veewave is watching 3 anime right now at the same time
<NewDCD> 9 Bjornfot It's GURREN LAGANN WITH MAGICAL GIRLSSSSSSSSSSS
<Sumica> IT"S A GUNDAM!
<Ghosties> 04That's not true
<interior_gummy> when it should have been n 88 minute episode
<TheMaster> i'll go back to watching who
<Bjornfot> o rly
<Nat> what.jpg
<CosmicChan> u guys watch PSG?
<Jimmy> ITSA PEENCH
<Ghosties> 04Fist of the North Star is the manliest damn anime ever
<EspyLacopa> Ghosties: Puella Magi Madoka Magica?
<NewDCD> 9 People call Nanoha the "Gundam Magical Girl"
<GabeMoist> Ohai Nanoha
<MrChang> fist of the north star and the DB series are the manliest
<MrChang> Gintama is the most funny anime to ever live.
<FlaschenJoe11> Morning Guys
<Luna> 07,1goodnight everypony
<EspyLacopa> No, TORIKO is manliest.
<TheMaster> berserk is the manliest
<MrChang> hands down
<interior_gummy> wait, why am i still complaining about the mlp episode?
<NewDCD> 9 I suppose that makes Madoka the Evangelion Magical Girl...
<Ghosties> 04Night
<FriendshipCannon> Most anime I can't tolerate because it feels so generic, like a lot of the slice-of-life high school crap they toss out.
<FlaschenJoe11> night Luna
<CosmicChan> night luna!!!!!!!
<FriendshipCannon> night Luna
<Applebloom> goodnight luna :)
<Veewave> 'Night uuuuuuuu
<AllisZero> Good night Luna
<MrChang> they're all doing crap in high school
<GabeMoist> You guys will love the transformation scenes
<NewDCD> 9 Also >yfw I'm planning on streaming The Legend of Kenshiro OVA

<NewDCD> 9 They're called MTFs (Mount Frames) and take advantage of the innate magic of each of the three pony classes
<DashWithRainbows> why not a trout?

<NewDCD> 9 Poor Nanoha
<Denied_Existence> 3 Good afternoon
<EspyLacopa> Spoiler: Men don't actually exist in the world of Nanoha. That's why they slowly disappear as the series progress and she grows up.
<Jimmy> How would they make Fluttershy any more moe?
<NewDCD> 9 Oh wow she's smart
*Natleyn hugs Denied_Existence

<GabeMoist> Haiiiii
<Applebloom> gabemoist: hi
<Sumica> Yeah did't this show start as a spin off of a hentai DCD?
*DashWithRainbows is driving the train
<SploogeTheFish> Anybody here?
<DashWithRainbows> i just felt something....
<EspyLacopa> Sumica: Yes.
<NewDCD> 9 Apparently. And then it became MAGICAL GIRLS: THE MECH ANIMU
<Veewave> yes
<DashWithRainbows> #bronystate
<DashWithRainbows> is the main chat
<SploogeTheFish> I have no idea why an anime is playing on the left of this..
<EspyLacopa> Triangle something I think

<Applebloom> hugs superbrony64
<Trollestia> No.
<GabeMoist> no
<SploogeTheFish> Lol dat ferret
<EspyLacopa> This anime is not hentai.
<Veewave> nope
<Flaria> Hiya FlaschenJoe11 :3
<DashWithRainbows> no sorry
<NewDCD> 9 And here, good sirs, is where we divert from most magical girl animus.
<DashWithRainbows> we are not mods
*Veewave win
<DashWithRainbows> we just help out
<SploogeTheFish> O.o
<Flaria> Is it lagging a tiny bit for anypony else? o_o
<interior_gummy> dat ferret
<Trollestia> Which stream is it?
<Jimmy> Where, DCD? The giant killy thing?
<DashWithRainbows> dont claim victory yet Veewave
<SploogeTheFish> One thing,Where exactly is this steaming from?
<SploogeTheFish> *streaming*
<GabeMoist> No
<SploogeTheFish> Like..What channel?
<DashWithRainbows> its is being streamed by the moderator known as NewDCD
<GabeMoist> The friendship
<EspyLacopa> Watch out Nanoha, Ganon is trying to kill you!
<DashWithRainbows> no channel
<GabeMoist> The friendship man
<Veewave> Veemi I think
<herospirit> :0
<interior_gummy> but screw it, i'm too mad about today's pony ep to think about ponies too much
<SploogeTheFish> Yeah. I know i ask a shitload of questions :l
<DashWithRainbows> i dno*
<herospirit> Friendship? :0
<DashWithRainbows> not really.
<DashWithRainbows> your just curious is all
<Veewave> Better ask the mods in the bronystate tab
<EspyLacopa> It's Aku, the shapeshifting master of darkness!
<Flaria> ^
<herospirit> His word is law.
<interior_gummy> so fuck it, the show is ruined until the next episode, when i will hopefully fall back in love
<Pegacorn> Throw the CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESE!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ....really?
<SploogeTheFish> So if a new MLP episode comes out its streamed here?
<Trollestia> I haven't seen episode 2 yet, need I gtfo in the meantime?
<herospirit> It wasn't that bad gummy. :0
<NewDCD> 9HENSHIN.....GUNDAAAAAAAAAMMM!!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not going to lie, that's rather pathetic gummy
<DashWithRainbows> yes
<DashWithRainbows> but it is said the next episode is in 2 weeks
<herospirit> ValtheJean is right.
<DashWithRainbows> Movie night is on friday
<SploogeTheFish> I got told 3 weeks
<FlaschenJoe11> Just go to EqD, they have links Trollestia
<EspyLacopa> Raising, or Raging?
<TheMaster> some people just can't be pleased.
<DashWithRainbows> well its just a rumour
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but hey, love and tolerate and whatnot. So you're entitled to your opinion
<interior_gummy> i know, but it was so damn overhyped
<SploogeTheFish> Is there anyway you can make like a homepage in google chrome?
<NewDCD> 9 let's go, GUNDAM!!!!!!!!!!
<EspyLacopa> At least Nanoha had the choice to design her own magic outfit. That's way better than most other magical girls
<DashWithRainbows> i dont have google chrome, sorry
<Applebloom> this anime is reminding me of a other anime oh yeah,sailor moon
<DashWithRainbows> ask someone in #bronystate for help
<Pegacorn> YOU GETTIN' MUGGED,KID!
<SploogeTheFish> Imagine if the next episode of MLP would be a halloween special,Sort of like Edd Ed N eddy went down.
<EspyLacopa> And she doesn't use a wand. . .she uses an actual Staff.
<Bjornfot> LOL SAILOR MOON
<DashWithRainbows> dude...
<EspyLacopa> Better for befriending/hitting people upside the head with.
<Pegacorn> Nope.You're getting mugged.
<Flaria> Applebloom: Silly, thats not how you spell magical girl animes
<NewDCD> 9Ohai Gundam
<Pegacorn> AAAAAAAAAAH HOW THE HELL DOES THAT EVEN WORK?
<DashWithRainbows> Ed. Edd n Eddy is one of my childhood cartoons
<SploogeTheFish> I know man.
*Veewave can leave this one to Dash
<Denied_Existence> 3So how did everyone like E2 today?
*Flaria hugs Pegacorn
<Flaria> Welcome back
*Trollestia GTFOs to EQD to watch episode two.
<DashWithRainbows> damn right you will
<herospirit> It's a Gundam?
<Flaria> Denied_Existence: I loved it :3
<SploogeTheFish> Heh.
<DashWithRainbows> still going to et revenge for the trout
<DashWithRainbows> get*
*Veewave is damn right
<Pegacorn> Who the hell is Flaria anyways?
<Bjornfot> TOTALLY NOT SAILOR MOON
<Flaria> Natleyn.
<SploogeTheFish> I still think that would be a good idea
<EspyLacopa> The Gundam aspect becomes very, very, obvious in the second season. Wherein the tools have bullet-shaped cartridges that they use to supercharge their spells.
<GabeMoist> Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<NewDCD> 9>Sailor Moon
<Trollestia> Who the hell is Pegacorn anyway?
<DashWithRainbows> halloween episode would be good
<SploogeTheFish> I mean,Discord is defeated
<NewDCD> 9>All Magical Girl animus ever
<Applebloom> flaria: well... the transformation reminds me of it
<SploogeTheFish> So whats next
<SploogeTheFish> ?
<Bjornfot> my lover/bitch, trollestia
<Denied_Existence> 3Robots, robots everywhere....
<Trollestia> oic
<Pegacorn> YOU GETTIN' MUGGED TROLLESTIA!
<DashWithRainbows> but any other holiday would most likely be crap
<DashWithRainbows> no one knows...
<Trollestia> Pegacorn: lolno
<SploogeTheFish> If HUB would take ideas,I would submit it to them
*Veewave mugs Pegacorn
<DashWithRainbows> thats why we wait for next episode
<EspyLacopa> Nanoha also loves being a magical girl, and trains her ass off.
<Flaria> No muggin's please
*Veewave is now richer
<The_Si> IT'S A GUND-...MAGICAL GIRL.
<Pegacorn> Nope Veewave,you're getting mugged!
<AllisZero> DAT RIKA VOICE
<EspyLacopa> She actually ends up hospitalized because she trains too much.
<AllisZero> It's totally Rika
<SploogeTheFish> I agree with you dash,Any other holiday would suck

*Veewave is mugged *sad face*
<AllisZero> I just wish
<Pegacorn> Veewave,it was a asdfmovie4 reference.
<AllisZero> The people who made these awesome backgrounds
<AllisZero> Knew how to actually draw the ponies
*Veewave is oblivious
<DashWithRainbows> if you have any other questions, i am willing to answer them (if i can)
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYNdUM2gRsg&feature=related
<Pegacorn> THERE.
<Flaria> AllisZero: What?
<SploogeTheFish> Well i got like a sort of Poll question
<DashWithRainbows> if you dont have any more questions just go into the main chat
<DashWithRainbows> go ahead, what you want to ask?
<SploogeTheFish> Alright,I will be right back
<TheMaster> got to wait for my next who episode to get loaded up. guess its time for more magical girls
<NewDCD> 9 Fun Fact: Even with that tame first episode, this animu includes Magical Girls flying at unholy speeds and breaking building windows with the sonic boom at match speed
<SploogeTheFish> Nvm
<SploogeTheFish> Hey.
<NewDCD> 9 *mach
<GabeMoist> yay
<SploogeTheFish> I was thinking,Dont you think a halloween special would be cool for the next episode?
<GabeMoist> Are we watching all of it?
<NewDCD> 9 Not NOW, but eventually
<Sumica> Dont forget the labrinth bypass methyod DCD.
<EspyLacopa> The first two seasons of this show are wonderful.
<NewDCD> 9 thismight be the last thing I stream fortonight
<NewDCD> 9 I actually have never watched Nanoha
<GabeMoist> heeeeeeeeeeeee?
*Veewave throws the cheese
<EspyLacopa> AKU!
<DashWithRainbows> ok NewDCD, i will go to bed when you stop...
<TheMaster> did card capture sakura rip this off?
<TheMaster> because it looks similiar from what I remember
<Sumica> I can pick after you are done DCD.
<NewDCD> 9GRATUITUOUS ENGRISHI
<EspyLacopa> Master, this came after CCSakura.
<TheMaster> oh
<NewDCD> 9 SUDDENLY FANCY MATHEMATICS
<Veewave> It's Digimon
<Flaria> Fancy mathmatics to muddle every issue
<DashWithRainbows> damn mathematics, they always muddy the issue!
<SploogeTheFish> Ive never watched this show ironically.
<SploogeTheFish> :l
<EspyLacopa> I think Card Captor Sakura came out in the mid-nineties. . ./me checks wikipedia
<EspyLacopa> Yup, mid nineties.
<TheMaster> was that probection?
<TheMaster> spelled out?
<DashWithRainbows> thats what i saw
<NewDCD> 9 DAT STAFF
<EspyLacopa> Both the CCS manga and anime ended in 2000.
<TheMaster> atleast she has something covering her lower half. unlike another magical girls show I can think of -cough-strikewitches-cough-
*Veewave marvels at winged staffs
<EspyLacopa> This show started in 2004.
<SploogeTheFish> That staff reminds me of something off Yu-Gi-Yo..I really dont know why.
<Bjornfot> >stand by ready
<AllisZero> Fate wears a mizugi, just saiyan
<Bjornfot> LOLWUT
<TheMaster> eventually they'll make a magical girl anime and try and handwave away that they have to wear clothes
<SploogeTheFish> They will never make a new anime,Sadly
<SploogeTheFish> The world is being consumed by shitty animated shows
<TheMaster> have hope, they're making a new berserk anime
<TheMaster> or movie
<SploogeTheFish> Like this new shit on CN..I mean come the fuck on.
<NewDCD> 9 They're making a new Rurounin Kenshin anime too
<AllisZero> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<AllisZero> This
<NewDCD> 9 also: I should totally stream My Life Me sometime
*NewDCD trollfaces
<TheMaster> ...not sure if serious
<EspyLacopa> OH, the by the way, you think I was joking about one of Nanoha's friends being a vampire? HA!
<NewDCD> 9>Watching Nanoha for theplot and not for the BEFRIENDING
<CriticKitten> So I click back and there's a talking ferret. wut
<EspyLacopa> Ok, not a vampire. She's a ghost with a grudge against everything living.
<SploogeTheFish> Odd,about almost all of the people here arent talking. lolwut
<DashWithRainbows> im watching it because its on stream...
<EspyLacopa> Then Nanoha punched her in the face, and they became friends. True story.
<TheMaster> who would wear their hair like that?
<DashWithRainbows> @ SploogeTheFish that always happens
<SploogeTheFish> Im watching it because its a tad entertaining.
<TheMaster> with a giant...blog on the side of your head
<DashWithRainbows> usualy 80 people and about 20 speak
<TheMaster> her too!
<SploogeTheFish> Not 20 currently
<EspyLacopa> Seriously, the punch to the face happens in a flashback in this show.
*Veewave speaks
<DashWithRainbows> was earlier...
<SploogeTheFish> Only like..6-8
<NewDCD> 9 Nanoha fucks your shit up with MAGICAL POWER OF AWESOME and somehow that makes you befriend her
<TheMaster> her hair fringe flipped!
<DashWithRainbows> probably about 7-9 max
<SploogeTheFish> Yup
<NewDCD> 9Nanoha has what I like to call FULL-CONTACT FRIENDSHIP
<EspyLacopa> Nanoha doesn't /actually/ need magic powers to BEFRIEND people. It's just more fun that way.
<EspyLacopa> She can do it by punching people in the face.
<NewDCD> 9And she also is the poster girl for Defeat Equals Friendship
<NewDCD> 9I wish I could befriend people by Rider Kicking them ;___;
<EspyLacopa> NewDCD: Have you tried it?
<NewDCD> 9Yeah. They just explode twice.
<EspyLacopa> Ah. I suppose that /would/ be a problem.
<SploogeTheFish> I was reading on the pony thread on funnyjunk,people said they where a little dissapointed how discord was already done
<NewDCD> 9 Man how would it be if her love interest was a ferret. Let us be glad that Nanoha is into Fate : 3
<SploogeTheFish> People were thinking he would say "Suprise!" and just fly away somewhere
<Trollestia> >implying discord had a chance of making it past episode 2
<TheMaster> there are weirder ships in the universe
<TheMaster> dc has a gorrila and a brain in a jar as a canon gay couple
<SploogeTheFish> What was his chance? lolwut
<NewDCD> 9Case in point: Fluttershy X Bloomberg
*Veewave is in love with distractions
<Trollestia> Besides, now Celestia can get back to trolling.
<EspyLacopa> NewDCD: Remember, men in Nanoha's world don't actually exist.
<SploogeTheFish> What would you do if all the ponies got turned onto discords side? (aka turning grey)
<TheMaster> I just saw one though
<EspyLacopa> They're just imaginary friends that slowly vanish as she grows up.
<pony_5604> <3
<NewDCD> 9 Right. I forgot.
<TheMaster> theres one!
<TheMaster> you can see the back of his head
<pony_5604> ;):):(:'(6_9:S:[<3:|:P:D:O:$
<NewDCD> 9NANOHA, TEACHING US JAPANESE
<SploogeTheFish> So,Do you stream anything else?
<GabeMoist> What about Jail Spaghetti from Strikers?
<EspyLacopa> She's got a mental block where her dad is concerned: he actually got killed by terrorists when she was 3 or 4 years old.
<SploogeTheFish> Terrorists during 9/11 im presuming.
<Flaria> KIHEN IS FLUTTERSHY
<GabeMoist> He's a men
<EspyLacopa> Note, Nanoha never met Jail. Fate fought him, supposedly.
<TheMaster> alright, time for more doctor who
<EspyLacopa> Everyone is just humoring her slowly disappearing delusions.
<Pegacorn> I AM A STEGOSAURUS.
<SploogeTheFish> Admin?
<EspyLacopa> When you have enough magical power to blow up moons, you're far more willing to play along with harmless things like that.
<SploogeTheFish> Admin? D:
<Pegacorn> PIANO!
<Flaria> Yay Sibsy

<Trollestia> nou
<SploogeTheFish> aeiou
<EspyLacopa> The movie adds even more training for Nanoha: She daydreams combat simulations with Yuuno.
<DashWithRainbows> those sidwalks are really safe...
<EspyLacopa> See, the evil ghost pulled on her pigtails!
<EspyLacopa> So, /evil/!
<Pegacorn> BANANA FIGHT!

<Sumica> loots of booze and a late night at seaworld
<AllisZero> Wait, this is by Sunrise isn't it
<AllisZero> Anyway, they got some hobo, gave him LSD and a notepad
<AllisZero> Told him to write the stories that chick tells
<AllisZero> That's why, Sam the Squid-piercer
<EspyLacopa> So, what's next on the stream?
<Sumica> nichijou
<EspyLacopa> Ah, haven't watched that.
<Sumica> then Bebop
<GGgala> never heard of nichijou....
<Sumica> it translates to "my ordonary life"
<The_Si> lol wut
<GGgala> what was that a live action of...
<Veewave> Good commercials
<GGgala> 'The Most Beautiful Death in the World'? what
<Sumica> [GG] be trolling with the subs
<Prison> BROWNIES
<Prison> How goes it?
<GGgala> dat video tearing
<Sumica> yeah I hate VLC for that
<Flaria> NICHIJOUUUUUUUUUUU
<Veewave> cat!
<Prison> :I
<Sumica> Zplayer never dose that to me
<Flaria> <3
<Prison> :U
<GGgala> ohay Prison--oh crap is your show on tonight?
<TheMaster> now which anime is this?
<Prison> It's on tomorrow
<TheMaster> I keep coming back to different ones
<Prison> OHIO BRONIES MEETUP WEEKEND 2011
<EspyLacopa> Hmmm. This looks delightfully silly.
<Sumica> oh it is
<Prison> The Ohio bronies and I just went to the Renaissance Festival today
<Tovler> mmm, not sure if want
<EspyLacopa> Shoo be doo? Did I hear that right?
<Bjornfot> ...wtfisthis
<ThePretender> THEY HAVE NO MOE
<MobileDCD> I wish there were bronies in Panama
<MobileDCD> Aside from the 14-year-kid I know from Ponychan.
<MobileDCD> He's alright, but I'm 20 years old and would like someone at least a year older
<EspyLacopa> Sumica, you watched Usagi Drop?
<Prison> But at 14, they're fresh.
<Prison> Ripe for the picking
<Prison> or PLUCKING
<Prison> or dicking
<Sumica> Have it but havent watched it yet.
<Bjornfot> if you only read your last sentence, dcd.... it sounds like, um...
<MobileDCD> 'Cept his male and DCD's barn door don't swing that way
<EspyLacopa> I have it all downloaded, but I still have only watched up to ep4.
<Sumica> Mai, is always trolling.
<Tovler> one of those talking girl shows like Lucky Star?
<Prison> Slice of Life, you mean
<Flaria> MobileDCD: Best euphemism for sexuality
<MobileDCD> what I mean is, I hear madmax is 15
<MobileDCD> I'd probably hang out with her if I could
<MobileDCD> But for some reason 14 feels awkward for some strange reason
<MobileDCD> Probably due to the fact that 15 is accepted as the age when one (mainly young ladies) start their road towards their adulthood in Latin American cultures
<Prison> lolpedo~
<EspyLacopa> Azumanga Daioh is still the best slice of life.
<Tovler> a genre of slice of life
<Prison> Azumanga Daioh? That's not how you spell "Nichijou"
<MobileDCD> but yeah
<EspyLacopa> Nichijou doesn't have Penguin Chiyo.
<Tovler> Azumanga has charming moments of silence. Not sure if this one had them.
<ThePretender> DAT AFRO
<Veewave> lol
<MobileDCD> I think it's a cultural thing
<MobileDCD> 14 years are still seen as kids here, and 15 year olds are already treated like adults
<MobileDCD> I also think I feel more comftable with a 5-year age gap rather than a 6-year age gap
<Veewave> lol
<Bjornfot> 1 year plus or minus...
<EspyLacopa> Hey Bjornfot, did you die for our sins?
<Bjornfot> 5 or 6 younger, i'd hit him anyway
<Veewave> What is with this show?
<Sumica> it's made of random
<Veewave> inorite
<Bjornfot> yes, epsylacopa, i did
<Bjornfot> but hell didn't want me so they sent me back
<MobileDCD> Bjornfot I thought you weren't into guys but in the last few days I've been inclined to think otherwise
<Bjornfot> :I
<Flaria> :l
<Bjornfot> mobviledcd, you know veyr well that my barn door does not discriminate
<Bjornfot> it's like, common knowledge
<Sumica> Bjornfot seems to like any thing with a pulse as of late.
<MobileDCD> so are you or are you not?
<MobileDCD> Either is fine but confusion is a terrible thing for bystanders
<EspyLacopa> Bjornfot is Captain Jack Harkness?
<Bjornfot> remember when you streamed yourself?
<Bjornfot> when we made you read me x pegacorn?
<ThePretender> where was Gondor when DCD streamed himself?
<Veewave> Gondor was on the can
<Bjornfot> srsly wtf is wrong with this show
<DashWithRainbows> he was sitting on a can?
<MobileDCD> Bjornfot you said you weren't gay at that moment
<MobileDCD> You could have just said you were bi man D:
<Veewave> yesh
<DashWithRainbows> that must of hurt after a while
<Bjornfot> yeah mobiledcd
<Bjornfot> i'm not gay
<EspyLacopa> A robot girl?
<Sumica> yes EspyLacopa
<MobileDCD> Captain Bjornfot Harness
<Bjornfot> you don't have to be gay to like the same sex >_>
<Sumica> built by a child.
<Bjornfot> bisexuality is actually very common and trendy nowadays
<Bjornfot> i don't like labeling myself, though
<Veewave> What just happened?
<DashWithRainbows> i have no idea what this discussion is about...
<Bjornfot> i'm just... sexual
<Bjornfot> i don't discriminate
<MobileDCD> ahhhhh I see
<MobileDCD> That makes sense
*ThePretender is allergic to cats.
<CriticKitten> Meow.
*ThePretender is also allergie to moe. ACHOO
*DashWithRainbows hates cats....
<Veewave> FLUFFY!
<Bjornfot> men, women, transgender, hermaphrodites, ponies...
<MobileDCD> yeah labels are kind of a necessary evil
<MobileDCD> They're convenient but can lead to problems and discrimination
<Bjornfot> all ok in my book
<Sumica> so you are a Trysexual? Try any thng?
<CriticKitten> DashWithRainbows: You make me sad. :(
<Bjornfot> no sumica
<Tovler> Pansexual
<MobileDCD> >Ponies
<MobileDCD> Thaaaaaaat's going a bit too far bro
<Bjornfot> i'm a STOP LABELING ME AND LEAVE ME ALONE
<DashWithRainbows> im sorry but i just dont like them :l
<DashWithRainbows> im just gunna Bjornfot as Bjornfot
<Bjornfot> not real ponies, mobiledcd
<DashWithRainbows> label *
*Veewave gets labelgun
<EspyLacopa> Talking cat!
<CriticKitten> But I like youuu. ;_;
<Bjornfot> only FiM ponies
<CriticKitten> Also what's with that cat's face?
*Veewave marks Bjornfot down to half-price
<Bjornfot> because it wouldn't really be bestiality, since they have human intelligence and can talk and all
<MobileDCD> Let's just say you're omnisexual
<MobileDCD> Because everything sounds cooler with omni- before it
<Bjornfot> i think it would be ok, to bang them, if they were real
<Bjornfot> :D
<CriticKitten> ._.
<DashWithRainbows> Bjornfot for half price!?!?!
<CriticKitten> Dat face
<DashWithRainbows> GIVE ME 10 OF THEM NAO!
<GGgala> unbeatable bargain!
<Bjornfot> :I
<CriticKitten> ....
*Veewave goes to the back room to check if there are more Bjornfots
<DashWithRainbows> guy screams at a doll.
<MobileDCD> that said
<MobileDCD> Bjornfot, human intelligence on non-humans raises an interesting point I wish to address on my fics
<CriticKitten> Scream? I dunno if you can call it that
<Bjornfot> mk
*Veewave only has 1
<DashWithRainbows> darn...
<CriticKitten> It was more like....he suddenly had asthma.
<Veewave> We can order more
<DashWithRainbows> only 1 bjorn....
<Bjornfot> but, really...
<Bjornfot> everypony would be ok with, like, spike x rarity, right?
<DashWithRainbows> nah im just gunna go buy more jetpacks instead
<MobileDCD> because if the non-physical aspect of love is based on kindred spirits and complimenting personalities
<Bjornfot> so why not human x spike or human x rarity?
<MobileDCD> because of the Empathy Effect
<MobileDCD> We're human, so certain conducts have become ingrained into our collective psyche as taboo and wrong
<CriticKitten> Spike's underage. Otherwise, w/e floats your boat. :p
<Bjornfot> fuck taboo
<Bjornfot> fuck morals
<Bjornfot> fuck society
<MobileDCD> case in point: chances are we're very, very distantly related
<DashWithRainbows> what is the discussion between Bjornfot and MobileDCD even about!??!
<Sumica> screwing ponys I think DashWithRainbows
<MobileDCD> it's not society, though. It's a species' natural progression
<Bjornfot> fuck norms
*DashWithRainbows grabs handgun
<EspyLacopa> Does Bjornfot wear a skirt or a kilt?
<Bjornfot> eeenope
<MobileDCD> Not norms, but rather, a method of natural population control
*Veewave grabs Dash's other gun
<Bjornfot> i'm not that hipster.. yet
<DashWithRainbows> im ready to end this shit
<DashWithRainbows> when it gets out of hand... i mean hoof...
<MobileDCD> you see
*Veewave 's gun goes "cha-chick"
<Sumica> how you gonna work the trigger with a hoof?
*DashWithRainbows did not think this through....
<MobileDCD> thousands of years ago
<DashWithRainbows> IDEA!
*Veewave solved this with bigger triggers
<Sumica> more gun?
*DashWithRainbows flys to his weapons bunker and grabs a missle
<Veewave> OH SHI-
<MobileDCD> when the homo sapiens started to appear upon the Earth
*DashWithRainbows flies above everypony holding missile
*Veewave gets in mooncannon
<DashWithRainbows> does this answer your question?
<MobileDCD> brb. Sociology lesson later
*Veewave fires mooncannon
<Bjornfot> awww
<Sumica> so you want to kill every one that has even heard the conversation?
*Veewave is on the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
<DashWithRainbows> maybe...
<Flaria> Shoo be doo?
<DashWithRainbows> only if it gets seriously out of hoof
<Veewave> Now I will be the only survivor
<Veewave> ...on the moon
<DashWithRainbows> i live on the moon, i will be returning...
<Sumica> I ignore your reality and substatue my own.
*Veewave still has Dash's modified gun
<Veewave> ...Substatue?
<DashWithRainbows> bullets will go slower on the moon
*Veewave goes faster on the moon
<DashWithRainbows> and i use a jetpack to fly in space
<Veewave> It's physics
<EspyLacopa> Why does she have a massive gun?
<MobileDCD> Kay
<MobileDCD> So, it's not because of the norms of society that we avoid these situations, but rather, due to a biologically self-programmed population response in our species
<DashWithRainbows> because...who doesnt carry a gun to school
<Sumica> she is Tsugundri
<EspyLacopa> Substitiary Locomotion?
*Veewave has massive gun
<Bjornfot> yeah right
*DashWithRainbows realises he has Heavy's Sasha
<DashWithRainbows> fuck that shit...
<Bjornfot> >self-programmed
<DashWithRainbows> i got a missile
<MobileDCD> When the homo sapiens started to roam the Earth, incest was rampant, and we're talking the father/mother/daughter/son/uncle/ect. Type
<DashWithRainbows> so basically, anyone you mate with is related to you...
<MobileDCD> Later on, the concept of "parentship" came forward: incest was then reserved to the same generation. Parental incest dissapeared almost completely, but sibling incest was very common
*Veewave attaches Dash's spare jetpack to Sasha
<Bjornfot> ...but what has incest to do with bestiality
*DashWithRainbows does not need such a puny weapon
<MobileDCD> Dash: it's a likely possibility that a person is related really distantly to you. Remember, though, that the human race was distributed unevenly across the globe
<MobileDCD> hold on Bjornfot, getting there
<DashWithRainbows> true, true...
*Veewave has very expensive bullets "fuck your one shot"
<MobileDCD> anyways
<DashWithRainbows> beastiality is just fucking wierd....
<DashWithRainbows> end of discussion
<Bjornfot> LOL
<Diftraku> I change window to irc
<Bjornfot> good argument
<Diftraku> first thing is see
<Bjornfot> "weird"
<EspyLacopa> What about necrophilia?
<Diftraku> 04:37:01 < DashWithRainbows> beastiality is just fucking wierd....
*Veewave does not care
<Diftraku> Wat.jpg
<Bjornfot> wierd is 100% subjective
<MobileDCD> this response was brought forth by a reason: to avoid abnormalities in the gene pool, for one, and for two, to actually bring more variety to the gene pools, resulting in offsprings more fit for survival
<Tovler> A woman with 2 heads is normal to some.
*Veewave flips shit
<Flaria> >mfw coming back to #bronystate to see MobileDCD's posts
<Veewave> conversation over
<Bjornfot> lawl
<DashWithRainbows> well, this chat has seriously screwed up at some point
<MobileDCD> Basically, at first, the human race first concentrated on "quantity" of the production, while later, it focused on "quality".
<MobileDCD> natural progression, considering that death rates during the rising of our race were higher than 50%
<Ziltoid> Hey ponies what are we watching?
<Bjornfot> ...how can we know any of that for sure?
<MobileDCD> thing is
<Bjornfot> wild mass guessing by so called scientists?
<Veewave> yes
<Ziltoid> wut
<Veewave> I think therefore I am right
<DashWithRainbows> Wow this chat is so fucking interesting!!
<Ziltoid> Why can animals speak?
<Bjornfot> i mean, there couldn't have been many records where they like, wrote HEY WE LIKE INCEST MKAY
<Ziltoid> I am confuzzled
<MobileDCD> pshaw
<MobileDCD> By studying population patterns, evidence, and because it's manifested in pretty much every other living creature in the planet
<DashWithRainbows> the amount of fucks i give!
<MobileDCD> also brb food
<Tovler> Religion was essential to the development of human civilization, now it's outdated.
*Veewave gives a fuck
<Bjornfot> ^
<Bjornfot> NOT
<Veewave> lol
<EspyLacopa> Poor Sakamoto.
<Veewave> *wtf-animeface*
<Ziltoid> wee wee
<Ziltoid> poke
<Ziltoid> Did my chat die?
<Sumica> no
<DashWithRainbows> nope...
*Veewave "Let's never talk of this again."
<MobileDCD> back
<Flaria> Hiya DCD.
<DashWithRainbows> now we return to the main event!
<Tovler> k, so it's not slice of lice.
<Ziltoid> Whats the name of this anime?
<Sumica> Nichijou
<Bjornfot> >SLICE OF LICE
<DashWithRainbows> the argument that makes me not give any fucks about humanity
<Flaria> NI
<Flaria> CHI
<Flaria> JOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<MobileDCD> yeah, religion made them taboos surge, but yeah, it's basically a preprogrammed response
<MobileDCD> First magic, then religion
<Ziltoid> DAAAWWWWW
<Bjornfot> AWW YEAH MAGIC
<EspyLacopa> Science is next?
<Ziltoid> GASP
<EspyLacopa> What comes after science?
<MobileDCD> also Bjornfot: "normal" is nothing more than a statistical concept people misuse and wield to justify cruelty
<Bjornfot> ya
<EspyLacopa> Sanity is a one-trick pony, it only gives you one thing: Reality
<Flaria> Suddenly, pony chat is now philosophy
<AllisZero> Magic, Science and Religion?
<EspyLacopa> But when you're good and crazy, the sky's the limit!
<AllisZero> The fuck did we turn into an Index chat now?
*Veewave thinks this show will cause death
<EspyLacopa> Well, logically, eventually Science will be irrelevant by that arguement, and thus we'll be onto the next stage. In the same way as leaving behind Magic and Religion.
<Tovler> Ponies has made me fear death. I can't die until after the show is cancelled.
<MobileDCD> "Normal" means "that which manifests itself in the area of a graph with the highest probability of an isolated occurence"
<MobileDCD> In other words, it basically means "most common aspect"
<Veewave> Science is magic
<Ziltoid> My goal in life is to become an erogenous cloud
<AllisZero> No
<AllisZero> Friendship is
<Bjornfot> sufficiently advanced technology (aka science) is indistinguishable from magic
<Veewave> Friendship is SCIENCE
<Randall1160> I GOTZ A FEVER (no really it sucks) AND THE ONLY PERSCRIPTION IS MOAR PONIES
<AllisZero> I don't view it like that, Bjornfot
*Veewave is tapped out of ponies
<MobileDCD> however, the "normal", being a statistic measurement, only works for classifying isolated characteristics, and not for a whole being, specially as complex as the human race
<MobileDCD> You could search for a "normal" area for an isolated characteristic, but nothing more
<Randall1160> BTW what are we watching?
<Sumica> Bebop is next
<Veewave> nichijou
<Randall1160> I see I see
<EspyLacopa> So, once our magic gets sufficiently advanced in a thousand years, will we be back at Religion again?
<MobileDCD> however....that means a simple thing. Nobody can truly be "normal", nor is fully not "normal"
<Sumica> going to refresh the stream here in a moment.
<Bjornfot> of course, dcd
*Veewave agrees
<MobileDCD> Everybody is strange in some ways
<Bjornfot> common knowledge: "normal" does not exist and is not achievable
<Sumica> back up
<Veewave> Which episode?
<Sumica> 3
<MobileDCD> And...."Normal" is not necessarily good, nor "abnormal" is necessarily bad.
<MobileDCD> Opposite is also true
<Veewave> hm
<MobileDCD> and yet, people keep calling out others saying they are not "normal"
<MobileDCD> Oh! Beautiful yet hypocritical species of mine!
<Bjornfot> yeah
<Bjornfot> we ar elike that
<Bjornfot> we're... human
<Flaria> 'meh.
<Sumica> speak for your self.
<Bjornfot> if we listen to our instincts and emotions too much
<MobileDCD> In your striving for a commonly accepted standard, you blinded yourself to the fact that this is neither achievable nor desireable!
<Ziltoid> dem legs
<Bjornfot> if everyone used their brains instead, the world would be a better place
<EspyLacopa> Enlightened Anarchy?
<MobileDCD> Truly, how lackluster life would be, should we all be equal beings cut from the same chipping block! Abhorrent existence!
<Veewave> Sux to be you all of existence would say
<MobileDCD> and yet, these classifications, like "that man is not normal", have no end in sight. Such is the curse of the nature of the emotional animal that is the homo sapiens.
<MobileDCD> and yes, DCD likes Victor Hugo's writing style
<Bjornfot> yes... go on...
<MobileDCD> but Bjornfot, I'm done
<Bjornfot> ...
<MobileDCD> I've ranted for far too long XD
<Bjornfot> oh...
<Ziltoid> what
<Bjornfot> kay?
<MobileDCD> also food is here brb
<Bjornfot> so, what was your point?
<Bjornfot> or did you just feel like ranting?
<Ziltoid> video derp
<Flaria> wat
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Sumica> kat on kb
<Dark_Horst> good evening gentlemen. what are we wathcing?
<Rainbow-Dash> I have returned, my wounded arm healed
<Bjornfot> dat YTP
<Rainbow-Dash> *cough cough*
*Rainbow-Dash glances at Sumica
<Veewave> Cowboy Bebop
<Sumica> =p
<Dark_Horst> is it good?
<Veewave> Depends on what you like
<Dark_Horst> well, i just got mentally raped, so i hope it is
<Dark_Horst> write me down as oficcially traumatized
<Veewave> Just watch and talk about it with other bronies, that's why we're here anyway
<Dark_Horst> i listened to the german dub of mlp
<DashWithRainbows> well i have not even heard of this show, but still your better off in the main chat #bronystate
<Dark_Horst> alright, i'll be there
<DashWithRainbows> this room is pretty much a help room that Veewave and i watch...
<Veewave> yarp
<EspyLacopa> To bed!
<EspyLacopa> And delicious, magical, science.
<Ziltoid> night espy
*Veewave waves
*Veewave doesn't cheat at Blackjack (honest)
<Flaria> SUDDENLY
<Flaria> PIANO BLACK
<Flaria> <3
<Ziltoid> veewae is liarjack
<Liarjack> yo
<Ziltoid> oh hey there
<Ziltoid> lol
<Liarjack> I'm Veewave
<Sumica> that apple is a lie
<Dark_Horst> hi. what'S happening?
<DashWithRainbows> im gunna sign off now as its 3:04am and i want some sleep, i will be on tomorrow as well.
<Flaria> Alrighty!
<Flaria> Nighty night, DashWithRainbows!
<Liarjack> 'night
*Flaria hugs DashWithRainbows
<Flaria> Sleep well :3
<Sumica> take care Dash
<DashWithRainbows> so goodnight everypony!
*DashWithRainbows hugs bronystate
<Dark_Horst> what time period is this set in?
<Liarjack> "sleep with the fishes"
<Sumica> 2200's I think
<Randall1160> JEZUZ I CANT STOP SHAKING, I hate fevers, 108o F D:
<Sumica> go see Dr mario
<Randall1160> loool
<Randall1160> I wish C:
<Bjornfot> CHIPCEPTION
<Dark_Horst> well, be happy about your fever, I AM SHAKING because i just listened to the german mlp:fim dub
<Randall1160> LOL
<Ziltoid> lawl
<Dark_Horst> i feel so ashamed
<Randall1160> look at the suave d00d
<Veewave> sitin' on the toilet
<Randall1160> lol
<AllisZero> INTERNET HATE MACHINE
<Dark_Horst> this is amusing
<Dark_Horst> i need something amusing after that mental rape
<MobileDCD> back
<Randall1160> Rgr
<Kencolt> This I did not expect-- Cowboy Bebop?
<Dark_Horst> is there anything known about the science of this series?
<Randall1160> fallout lolol
*Veewave "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."
<Dark_Horst> that guy augmented?
<MobileDCD> also Bjornfot: my point is that these "normal" behaviors exhibit themselves due to human protection mechanisms
<MobileDCD> Deviating from these is not inherently bad, albeit some exits from said norm will be, naturally, seen as unnatural to a large part of the population, even if both sides mean no evil
<Kencolt> Cowboy Bebop? Really? I did not expect that.
<Rainbow-Dash> you forgot the part where i showed you my empty table and said "here is where i could keep my fucks, if i gave any"
<Rainbow-Dash> Quote some random guy on YT
<Randall1160> looool
<Veewave> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO not the normal stuff again.
<Randall1160> lol no securing line
<Randall1160> he could have floated off into OUTER SPAAAAAAAAACE
<LordCelestia> And then I was like OATMEAL, are you crazy?
<LordCelestia> oh.
<Dark_Horst> but since this is a charater with future storyline, it worked
<Randall1160> YESH
<LordCelestia> hi everyone
<Randall1160> Hallo thAr
<Rainbow-Dash> Hi LordCelestia
<Veewave> Magnets: that's how it works
<LordCelestia> how everybody doin tonight?
<Kencolt> Sudden disturbing mental image. FlutterFaye. DEFY anyone to realise that!
<Dark_Horst> look! a classical deal standoff
<Dark_Horst> IN SPACE
<Randall1160> dat standoff
<MobileDCD> why, Veewave? Do you not enjoy a good philosophical discourse? Nothing is greater that trying to analyze human nature: that vast, endless, and hauntingly ephemeral metaphysical existence that is impossible to grasp.
<MobileDCD> For doing so, is an impossible yet possible dream, a beautiful maiden intoxicating us with the fragrance of her perfume
<LordCelestia> Oh hi DCD
<Dark_Horst> dat 9mm in sci fi
<MobileDCD> ohai LordCelestian
<Veewave> I've heard this discussion with my friends before
<LordCelestia> ^auto correct? haha
<Veewave> That's all.
<Randall1160> BULLETS IN SPACE? What a contradiction
<Dark_Horst> why does that gatling sound like lazers?
<Sumica> why dose a gun in space sound like any thing?
<Randall1160> TRUE!
<Veewave> Whalers on the moon: a new discussion
<Kencolt> Sinc when do lazers make sounds?
<Randall1160> ALSO TRUE
<Dark_Horst> bullets in space are ANYTHING BUT a contradiction
<Sumica> I hear they carry a harrrrrrpoooooon!
<Ziltoid> since star wars
<Randall1160> well they wouldnt go very far
<Dark_Horst> ballistics in zero grav is your friend
<Randall1160> Oops my bad
<Randall1160> your right
<MobileDCD> you must remember, however, that no two souls are identical, and no two viewpoints, exactly alike.
<MobileDCD> Some might believe the words of Voltaire and Rosseau, while others might dwell on the thought that we are sinister by the nature of our own conception.
<Randall1160> THERE I SAID IT D':
<Dark_Horst> in fact, james isaac newton is the meanest motherfucker in space
<Bjornfot> LOL SOUL
<Sumica> dat mass effect quote
<Dark_Horst> truest words ever
<Dark_Horst> so, will the mood ALWAYS be so casual in combat situations?
<Flaria> MobileDCD, messing with your mind ever eince ever
<Dark_Horst> i mean, we had bullets, missiles, all that shit, to the music of a shopping mall
<Bjornfot> ok, it's 04:17, i should get some sleep
<Bjornfot> night, BronyState!
<Rainbow-Dash> Night Bjornfot
<Veewave> *yawn* peace out folks.
<Rainbow-Dash> Let your dreams be filled with troll
<LordCelestia> bye veewave
<MobileDCD> Bjornfot, what is a soul. It is not necessarily a spiritual concept.
<MobileDCD> Perhaps, a soul is but a word we can use to describe the psyche. The essence of a person, if you will. Religious concepts do not weight on the identity of some.
<LordCelestia> hush now quiet now it's time to lay your sleepy head
<Kencolt> This is okay, but Pony Bebop is better.
<Dark_Horst> those james bond hands
<Sumica> yeh Kencolt but it's harder to remake the whole show with ponies then it is just the OP
<Rainbow-Dash> Why am I tempted to log into DeviantArt just to join every single MLP group I can find?
<Kencolt> Oh, I would PAY so see a whole Bebop ep with ponies!
*MobileDCD really enjoys discussions of a deeper nature, as you can see
<Dark_Horst> fuel? not a drop. oxygen? NOT A WORRY AT ALL
<Kencolt> The Mushroom ep. HAS to be the mushroom ep.
<Sumica> O2 can be scrubed, fuel not so much.
<Dark_Horst> but at one point you run out of it
<Dark_Horst> and a tiny craft like that can only carry so much of it
<Kencolt> That face just screams bad guy.
<Kencolt> So does that one.
<Dark_Horst> SALAD STAB
<Sumica> greenpeace of the future!

<AllisZero> I just hate working with them
<AllisZero> Either I don't know how they work
<AllisZero> Or there's something wrong with my brain
<AllisZero> FUCKIN VECTORS HOW DO THEY WORK
<LordCelestia> they make anything around them transparent
<LordCelestia> wasy as that

<GGgala> oh boy Sugar Cubes again
<Sumica> have some more of the wrong ponies wille I go get some more ziacam
<Sumica> Oh hi GG
<SuperBrony64> I hate how they discontinued the Pre 3 before it was even released :(
<SuperBrony64> Or at least before it was released Stateside.
<Sumica> So acording to the guide 10/1 is ep 201 twice and 10/8 is ep 202 twice
<Sumica> the 15th will be ep 203
<SuperBrony64> Really? For real?
<SuperBrony64> Or is that your estimate?
<Sumica> yes
<SuperBrony64> Does it say the name of the episode?
<Sumica> I am looking at my cable guide
<Sumica> It just list it as MLP ep 203
<pony_5979> hey
<SuperBrony64> Uggghh…why do they need to repeat part 1 and 2 over a two week period?!
<pony_5979> was up
<ctrlx> wait. two weeks till a new ep?
<SuperBrony64> It's a great two-part episode…but damn…two weeks...
<pony_5979> hello?
<Sumica> So the rest of the eps line up with the fall show starts
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Unfortunately, yes.
<ctrlx> :|
<Sumica> 3 really
<ctrlx> eh. i can live.
<SuperBrony64> Here's hoping for some Christmas/Halloween specials :D
<ctrlx> yah :D
<SuperBrony64> But if those first two episodes are any indication of what's in store for Season 2, then this will be the best season EVER! :P
<Sumica> I am just wishing for more eps so people have more to work with on pmvs
<ctrlx> i haven't had time to get attached to the new season yet
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Episode 2 didn't win you over?
<Sumica> Kinda sick of "yay" 'louder"
<SuperBrony64> At least Season 1 wasn't the final season of MLP
<SuperBrony64> That would hurt…a lot
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, i love ponies. and i like the new season. but i've only seen ep2 once so far. i have to watch it again to get a feel for it and then i have to see the rest of the season to become attached to it
<Sumica> Oh god we have this on our playlist?
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, it won't be. but friendship is magic can only go so far.
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Darn, no wonder why. You need to watch episode 2 AT LEAST three more times :P
<ctrlx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-Tc8y3Guo&feature=related
<SuperBrony64> That's to get maximum Pony.
*Sumica has watched 202 3 times already today.
*SuperBrony64 brohoofs Sumica
<SuperBrony64> Every showing keeps getting better and better
<ctrlx> i'm downloading the ep right now actually
<SuperBrony64> Awesome! On iTunes right?
<ctrlx> i hate itunes
<ctrlx> and have a strong detest for apple products in general
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh…that means you piratin'
<ctrlx> ohgod 1080p version
<SuperBrony64> tsk tsk
<Sumica> Do what you want cause a pirate be free
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, when you buy off itunes, you're killing the industry.
<ctrlx> apple rapes artists
<ctrlx> just donate directly
<Sumica> it's a good thing I count as a nealson family else mlp would be loosing viewers by watching our stream.
<ctrlx> they actually get the money then
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Not really, money goes to the animators still. I'd much rather buy them from iTunes than pirate them.
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, talking about itunes. ITUNES
<SuperBrony64> Me too.
<ctrlx> apple takes 99.99% of the money you pay
<SuperBrony64> :P
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: No they don't.
<ctrlx> pretty much
<ctrlx> but they would get more if you just send them a paypal or something
<ctrlx> and bypass the middleman
<Sumica> I dont think they are hurting for cash if FiM brought in 5 mill last year.
<ctrlx> also what Sumica said
<ctrlx> lol
<SuperBrony64> They got a good portion of that money from iTunes I would suspect.
<Sumica> in fact I am sure that is why we have S2 and 3
<ctrlx> i'm planning on buying some new merch
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, nobody uses itunes
<Sumica> merc mostly for what I read
<ctrlx> and viewers on the hub
<Sumica> I would but from Itunes if I was't limmited to I devices
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: You don't use iTunes, but a lot of people actually use iTunes.
<ctrlx> omg itunes is so horrible coded
<SuperBrony64> But I mainly use Apple products anyway so it's no big deal.
<Sumica> Sure you noticed how much I hate not being able to use my prefered video player
<ctrlx> apple might be ok. i don't like their products but other people can. that's cool. but itunes....is discord
<Sumica> Only reaision I have an I phone is cause i found one after a tech show at work.
<ctrlx> put android on it
<SuperBrony64> I've tried using a lot of other phones out on the market, but none were as good (IMO) as an iPhone.
<Sumica> I will say I like it but would not pay the price they ask for one.
<ctrlx> not as good? or just different than what you were used to?
<ctrlx> apple products are ok. pricey for the hardware but software is just different.
<SuperBrony64> Not as good, interface was much slower, scrolling wasn't as natural, and there's no guarantee of apps working on a specific phone over another.
<ctrlx> i hate the style and how you can't mess around under the hood but that's me.
<SuperBrony64> The only other phone I would go for would be a Windows Phone 7
<Sumica> background programing s a bit bulky
<ctrlx> i hate win7 phones
<Sumica> 4 background programs in my taskmanager
<SuperBrony64> I've used that and it's got an interface that is near as good as the iPHone
<ctrlx> Sumica, for your desktop or phone?
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, it's just way too simple and restricted for me
<Sumica> so i can connect my phone to my PC
<ctrlx> Sumica, do wat?
<Sumica> background programs that sit in memory looking for me to connect my phone or othere moble Idevice
<SuperBrony64> Then that is the difference between you and me. I like devices that have a closed environment because everything works better together. I would give up customization over quality any day.
<ctrlx> Sumica, memory on your desktop or on your phone?
<Sumica> on my PC
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, i never have a problem with stuff not working.
<ctrlx> used to, though
<Sumica> 3 i can close and one is only if I want to share music
<SuperBrony64> I'm not saying other interfaces and apps don't work, I'm just saying it isn't as 'smooth' of an experience as I would like.
<Sumica> but it bugs me to have so much running in memory
<Sumica> especaly when streaming.
<SuperBrony64> For example, the browser on Android doesn't have the same fluidity in scrolling and zooming that Safari does on the iPhone.
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, mine works fine on my tablet. scrolling and zooming are beautiful
<ctrlx> my phone is an old android though. so it's stuttery
<ctrlx> both are hacked up so they perform better than stock versions
<SuperBrony64> The best thing I like about the iOS is the addition of iCloud in Apple's next update.
<Sumica> thought about jailbreaking mine but I dont want to brick it.
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: You won't brick your iPhone haha
<ctrlx> like google sync?
<SuperBrony64> It's like Google Sync, except it's more involved.
<Sumica> I kinda want to click that table flip link
<ctrlx> all i need are my contacts, dates, and whatnot
<ctrlx> i handle files myself, since it's easy
<SuperBrony64> iCloud does more with App data, Phone backup, etc. That's why I'm looking forward to it.
<Sumica> this video needs poneies
<SuperBrony64> The biggest thing I hated was having to sync my phone to my computer to put new content onto it from iTunes
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, oh i have backup stuff like that already
<SuperBrony64> But with iCloud, it does it over the internet.
<Sumica> oh this
<ctrlx> ^
<ctrlx> discord
<SuperBrony64> However, the one device I have that has trouble fitting in is my TouchPad, which I love :P
<SuperBrony64> I'll just have to see what the iPad 3 offers when it comes out
<ctrlx> should i get another ssd or double my ram?
<SuperBrony64> Double your RAM
<SuperBrony64> If you already have an SSD, bumping it up with slightly better specs won't make that big of a difference.
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, android tablets are pretty nice. different from phone android since they have more horsepower and some kernel differences
<ctrlx> :3 16gb 1866mhz
<SuperBrony64> I do like the Android tablets though. :P
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, i was gonna raid the two ssd's
<SuperBrony64> My personal favorite is the Galaxy Tab 10.11
<SuperBrony64> 10.1*
<ctrlx> honecomb tabs are nice
<ctrlx> any tegra 2 tab will pwn
<SuperBrony64> But I went with the HP TouchPad cause it dropped down to $150 :P
<ctrlx> i've seen my tablet overclocked to 1.8ghz from 1ghz
<ctrlx> <3 nvidia
<Sumica> bet that is a power drain.
<ctrlx> ewwwwww x86?
<SuperBrony64> IT depends if the processor is underclocked in the first place
<ctrlx> ;-;
<SuperBrony64> But it will make a difference in battery life nevertheless.
<ctrlx> the new psp is gonna have a quadcore arm from nvidia
<ctrlx> excited to see that baby :3
<SuperBrony64> I really want to get the PlayStation Vita
<SuperBrony64> But 3-5 hours of Battery life hurts.
<ctrlx> nah it's on-demand frequency scaling
<ctrlx> so it'll only drain more if i'm actually using that much more power
<SuperBrony64> It's the same as the 3DS, but I was hoping it would be better.
<Sumica> how did pennyarcade put it
<Sumica> 8hours if it just sits there, 5min if you want to play a game
<ctrlx> i only run 1.4
<SuperBrony64> Haha, that sums it up.
<ctrlx> and i get like 9 hours
<ctrlx> since i got it all tweaked
<ctrlx> nah mine can idle for at least a whole day
<ctrlx> i haven't really tested it
<ctrlx> doing something that pushes it to the max i get like 3-4 hours
<Sumica> Have to remember to turn off my wifi when I am not using it, kills my battery in like 3 hours
<ctrlx> so an average day i get about 9 hours
<ctrlx> but like i said i've tweaked it a lot
<ctrlx> yep
<ctrlx> wifi burns
<ctrlx> bluetooth
<ctrlx> power saving profiles
<ctrlx> task killers
<Sumica> I jack work networks
<ctrlx> a proper frequency scale scheduler
<Sumica> lol DCD must have added this one.
<ctrlx> and then basic screen timeout, etc
<Sumica> to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<ctrlx> you can boot backtrack5 on tablets now
<Sumica> 0_o
<SuperBrony64> You streamin' Sumica?
<Sumica> yes
<Sumica> it's the bronystate playlist
<SuperBrony64> You should play my awesome playlist that I've been perfecting :P
<Sumica> not bad animation.
<SuperBrony64> There's a hidden annotation on her tail near the middle of the video
<SuperBrony64> It links to another video that's unlisted :P
<Sumica> FFFFFFFFthis cold.
<SuperBrony64> I'll just leave my playlist here in case anyone's interested: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF62EACEFD4FD1533&feature=mh_lolz
<SuperBrony64> :P
<SuperBrony64> Although I've never actually linked a playlist before…so hopefully that's the right link...
<SuperBrony64> Oh, and my nose is bleeding now
<SuperBrony64> :S
<Sumica> looks like alot of the one I have seen at some point
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: Maybe so, but it's now in one convenient location :P
<Sumica> My PL is in a fine location too =p
<Sumica> just need to split mine as it has things from before I became a Brony
<SuperBrony64> Well good news then! My playlist has 99% Ponies :P
<Sumica> God I wish my new internets would be set up already.
<Sumica> dumb isp
<SuperBrony64> What's your current ISP?
<Sumica> what name would you like? The one when I started with them or the current one =p
<Sumica> Century Link is the current name
<SuperBrony64> I'm upset that a town that's near my home town is becoming a test market for some high speed internet
<SuperBrony64> 1 Gbps for $70 a month >:(
<Sumica> costly
<SuperBrony64> But 1 Gbps
<SuperBrony64> That's ungodly fast
<Sumica> yeah but who needs that much
<SuperBrony64> Streamers :P
<ctrlx> we pay $100 for 1.5mbit
<Sumica> that's just Dl speed
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Is it satellite?
<ctrlx> and have latencies 800+ on a regular basis
<Sumica> upload is never that fast
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, dsl is typically 3mbit
<ctrlx> i'd like to host my own servers
<Sumica> I will be paying 50 for 15 down 1.5 up
<ctrlx> cloud computing
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, you win!
<SuperBrony64> It's testing some new equipment, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was near that speed for upload.
<ctrlx> Sumica, depends on the connection. with fiber it would be
<SuperBrony64> Lol, I did?!
<Sumica> true but most towns wont have fiber.
<SuperBrony64> I'm paying $30 for 15-20 Mbps down
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, southern cali?
<SuperBrony64> NorCal FTW
<Sumica> they are supposedly upgrading here soon for 100down
<Spider_Jerusalem> Woah. Sure is less people in here.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Also, christ, what's up with my net
<ctrlx> i have a feel that i am lagg
<Sumica> Noting realy going on on a saterday.
<ctrlx> oh hey. xchat2 says 41s lag
<Sumica> that all
<SuperBrony64> For some reason, I have this video repeating itself in the background: http://youtu.be/PH8jpLwt4W0
<ctrlx> SuperBrony64, i knew they were testing fiber in cali
<Spider_Jerusalem> I may end up emulating my namesake against two of my roommates before the weekend is over.
<Sumica> I have started using xchats lag chat to help me know if I am stream lagging.
<ctrlx> Sumica, it's a test thing to see if it's economically viable to give fiber for the masses
<Sumica> I see
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Yup. Which is why I'm made my hometown isn't in the test market
<SuperBrony64> mad*
<Sumica> I know my old HS had T3 set up neare the end
<ctrlx> and this lagg is killing me so i'm going to bed. BED. under my blankets. A WHOLE PILE OF THEM
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Have fun :P
<Spider_Jerusalem> Hmmm. Doctor who?
<Spider_Jerusalem> OH LORD
<Sumica> Dari Dose Dr who
<Sumica> I tend to do anime and Burnnotice
<SuperBrony64> Hiccuping Pinkie is best Pinkie
<Sumica> but right now it's filler playlist cause i think i will go ptfo soon.
<Spider_Jerusalem> I have the distinct feeling I'm going to end up backhanding my roommate. :/
<Spider_Jerusalem> There are many things I'll put up with, but blatant disrespect is not one of them.
<Sumica> oro?
<SuperBrony64> Spider_Jerusalem: He stealing your internet?
<SuperBrony64> Oh boy!
<Sumica> oh man my ears dont need this >_<
<SuperBrony64> inb4 9999999999999999
<SuperBrony64> uuuuhhhhhhh
<Spider_Jerusalem> No, one of my roommates, who has yet to pay a dime to rent, has been trying to tell me what I can and can't do, in my own fucking apartment, in the most condescending disrespectful tones..
<SuperBrony64> John Madden
<Spider_Jerusalem> He's from Alabama. Go fucking figure.
<SuperBrony64> big american tts
<SuperBrony64> aeiou
<Sumica> 5 across the eyes
<SuperBrony64> Spider_Jerusalem: Smack him with a trout
<Spider_Jerusalem> 5 across the eyes? That means pimp slap?
<SuperBrony64> ?!?!?!?!
<SuperBrony64> brrbrbrbrbrbrbbrbrrbrbr
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…that was enough spam for one night.
<Sumica> yes backhand em or just say gtfo
<Sumica> no rent payed and name not on the lease
<Spider_Jerusalem> I think that next time he starts it up, I'm going to look him dead in the eyes, and tell him that the next time he starts it up, I'm going to backhand the teeth out of his mouth.
<Spider_Jerusalem> And if he keeps it up.....
<SuperBrony64> We must be in the same boat Spider_Jerusalem. I keep telling my roommate to change his ways and I don't pay him rent as well.
<SuperBrony64> Michael?
<Sumica> just be mindfull of where you do it, dislocated a guys jaw with a knucke backhand.
<SuperBrony64> *troll face*
<Spider_Jerusalem> Nah, I'm Christian.
<SuperBrony64> Haha
<SuperBrony64> Actually, my roommate pays me half of rent so we both on same page.
<Sumica> wait, are you guys roommates? =p
<Spider_Jerusalem> No, this is along the lines of him demanding that I stop what I'm doing and go hole up in my room so his guest can couch crash.
<Spider_Jerusalem> No.
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: Lulz no
<SuperBrony64> Just pulling a Discord
<Spider_Jerusalem> You know Derpy, Donut bar Chef, on Ponychan?
<SuperBrony64> Spider_Jerusalem: Force your roommate to start paying rent if he wants you to change.
<Sumica> no I only hang here and eqd
<Spider_Jerusalem> He's my roommate. But not the bad one.
<Spider_Jerusalem> I have three roommates.
<Spider_Jerusalem> In a 2bed 2bath. :/
<SuperBrony64> Force 'em all to pay rent or slap them with some trouts.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Derpy is fine.
<Spider_Jerusalem> ACtually, I'm not paying rent right now, due to being involved in legal matters against two seperate businesses.
<Sumica> I had a roomie that liked to go loose his pay check at the casinos before he got home.
<Spider_Jerusalem> But I also have the only working car, and constantly run people to and from. :/
<SuperBrony64> I lose my paycheck to Ponies :/
<Sumica> first time he did't pay up I turned on the child lock on the cable box and set it to pbs
<SuperBrony64> :P
<SuperBrony64> Nah, I'm just kidding...
<SuperBrony64> I don't get a paycheck :(
<Sumica> second time I told em to gtfo
<SuperBrony64> Dis video
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: Should've set it to The Hub. That'd show 'em…wait a minute...
<Sumica> nutron bomb ponyville
<Sumica> hub was't around back then.
<Sumica> if it was it was still discovery kids
<SuperBrony64> http://sorcerushorserus.deviantart.com/art/Dash-Academy-2-Hot-Flank-Part5-258921497
<SuperBrony64> Fluttershy is awesome!
<SuperBrony64> Uh-oh, mods are here. Hide the ponies!
<Sumica> Wrex
<Spider_Jerusalem> Anywho.
<SuperBrony64> Actually…I think his client just reset :P
<SuperBrony64> But nevertheless…hide the Ponies...
<SuperBrony64> Can't be too careful
<Spider_Jerusalem> Douche roommate demanded that I go to my room early, so his guest that he brounght over unannounced could sleep on my fucking couch.
<SuperBrony64> This video is trolling
<Sumica> indeed
<SuperBrony64> Tell him he's just in time for Pony videos
<Sumica> that is why i keep my system in my room.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Once I get a job, and sort my legal shit out, if he doesn't have a job, he's getting kicked the fuck out.
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: To keep people away from the Ponies?
<Spider_Jerusalem> And I'll do it in the asshole way.
<Sumica> so I dont have to deal with people in my home
<Spider_Jerusalem> I'll wait until he's out at the karaoke bar, like every fucking week, with his friends, and pitch his shit outside, then lock the door
<SuperBrony64> I'm the guy who will annoy the shit out of someone with Ponies if they annoy me :P
<SuperBrony64> Spider_Jerusalem: Are you the only one on the lease?
<Sumica> I used to anoy friends with pony, then they became brony and said othere streams suck
<SuperBrony64> Oh God Sumica, skip this video...
<Sumica> I kind like this vid
<SuperBrony64> "Approved for all ages!"
<SuperBrony64> NOOOOO
<Spider_Jerusalem> Nah
<Spider_Jerusalem> Me and derpy are on the lease.
<Sumica> in fact I am saving it to my random list
<Spider_Jerusalem> Douchebag and his girlfriend aren't.
<SuperBrony64> Derpy, huh?
<Spider_Jerusalem> Derpy from ponychan
<Spider_Jerusalem> Anywho. Douchebags girlfriend is a long time friend of mine.
<SuperBrony64> dis vid maeks mah brianmeatz hurt a lots
<Spider_Jerusalem> And I haven't told him to GTFO yet because she'd insist on moving too. And they don't have anywhere else to go at the moment.
<Sumica> this video is like somthing out of niconico
<Sumica> speaking of niconico
<SuperBrony64> I do enjoy dem Ponies
<SuperBrony64> Dis song
<Sumica> not a fan of this song.
<SuperBrony64> You not awesome or something?
<Sumica> I think it's more we play it too often
<SuperBrony64> If you don't drive your mom's ride, you not cool *puts on sunglasses at night*
<SuperBrony64> If only there was someone elses playlist we could play to end this monotomy...
<Sumica> =p
<SuperBrony64> I'll just push this on the table: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF62EACEFD4FD1533&feature=mh_lolz
<SuperBrony64> Let the enticing fumes of its fresh baked goodness fill the room
<Sumica> have this random while i go look for some cough meds
<SuperBrony64> No wait
<SuperBrony64> NOOOO
<SuperBrony64> *ears bleed*
<MeteorVenture> i thought that linked me to my favorites lols
<SuperBrony64> MeteorVenture: Does it? :P
<SuperBrony64> Never linked a Playlist before
<SuperBrony64> :S
<MeteorVenture> nah it's a playlist
<SuperBrony64> Hurray! Then we have success!
<Sumica> bleh this stuff is like cherry ass.
<MeteorVenture> it just looked extremely similar to what my favorites probably look lik
<MeteorVenture> like*
<Sumica> Oh Hi MeteorVenture
<MeteorVenture> hey sumica:D
<Sumica> I could put one of Dari's nightmarefuel picks on repeat for you all =p
<MeteorVenture> i just made a joke that took me like 10 minutes to make.. just for a simple comment.. WORTH IT
<SuperBrony64> What's the joke?
<MeteorVenture> http://www.facebook.com/BroniesCommunity/posts/253106294731527
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: You wouldn't dare...

<MeteorVenture> first read the main post
<MeteorVenture> i'm chunkatuff
<Spider_Jerusalem> I'm going to go have a smoke and make a sandwhich. If my roommate says a goddamned thing, I'm beating his ass.
<Sumica> Have fun storming the castle
<Spider_Jerusalem> hells yeah
<SuperBrony64> DIS HOMEWORK (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<MeteorVenture> it took me a while to find the right emoticon lol but it paid off
<SuperBrony64> Not to be mean…or dense…but I don't get it :S
<SuperBrony64> My favorite joke
<MeteorVenture> your hands hanve pinky fingers.. i wake up with 2 of them every morning
<MeteorVenture> have*
<SuperBrony64> "Hitler wasn't such a bad guy, after all he did kill Hitler"
<SuperBrony64> How about this one
<MeteorVenture> i would probably need to know more about hitler to get that one
<Sumica> he commited suaside
<Sumica> only spelled right
<MeteorVenture> ah then ya
<SuperBrony64> "My mate rang me and asked, "What're you doing at the moment?"
<SuperBrony64> I said, "Probably failing my driving test.""
<MeteorVenture> lol 2 letters off? close enough!
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Sumica> it's late and I am on cold meds so my rubish spelling will only get worse.
<SuperBrony64> MeteorVenture: Icwatudidthar
<SuperBrony64> And your video selection choice! :O
<SuperBrony64> :(
<SuperBrony64> No hard feelings…FRIENDSHIP?

<Sumica> feh
<MeteorVenture> here's my account if you want to see my favorites http://www.youtube.com/user/chunktuff
<MeteorVenture> as per part of the deal i guess i have to post my shamelessly self-promoted channel
<SuperBrony64> Nickelodeon?
<Spider_Jerusalem> Woo
<Spider_Jerusalem> Douche roommate was in the bathroom
<Spider_Jerusalem> I didn't have to fuck him up
<SuperBrony64> Spider_Jerusalem: Cause he already went to the bathroom…?
<MeteorVenture> but serious.. why so serious?
<SuperBrony64> Those Japanese anime girls and their skimpy outfits...
<Spider_Jerusalem> As in he was in the bathroom the entire time I was out of my room.
<SuperBrony64> They make me angry.
<SuperBrony64> Spider_Jerusalem: Oh! I see what you did there...
<SuperBrony64> One reason I like One Piece is they make fun of anime stereotypes
<GGgala> Topless? really
<FlaschenJoe11> Morning Guys
<GGgala> that's the English tey're going with

<GGgala> the double entendre can't be unintentional...
<Sumica> You will see
<SuperBrony64> The other anime I really like is Yatterman, but that went away after a season or two :/
<SuperBrony64> Starring the best character names ever!
<SuperBrony64> Yatterman-1 and Yatterman-2!
<SuperBrony64> This comic wins the most-depressing-comic-I've-seen-all-night award.

<Spider_Jerusalem> It's a game I like to call, "Where the hell did Spider put his damn phone?"
<Spider_Jerusalem> I'm not doing too well right now.
<Spider_Jerusalem> I seem to be losing.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Badly.
<FlaschenJoe11> Bathroom? I forgot quite a few things there
<Spider_Jerusalem> As I cannot find my damn phone
<GGgala_> I'd suggest calling it but that requires having your phone...
<FlaschenJoe11> is it your mobile or house phone?
<Spider_Jerusalem> mobile
<FlaschenJoe11> call it with your housephone
<MantisToboggan> http://i.imgur.com/nbZKt.jpg
<FlaschenJoe11> point goes to Mantis
<Spider_Jerusalem> Well. It's dead.
<Spider_Jerusalem> And I have no House Phone
<Spider_Jerusalem> I think it's time to go "Accidentally" wake douche roommate up.
<Spider_Jerusalem> Fuck! I have a long day of busting my ass ahead of me, and that phone's got my music on it!
<Spider_Jerusalem> AHA!
<Spider_Jerusalem> SPIDER FOUND HIS PHONE!
<GGgala_> ^flawless victory
<Spider_Jerusalem> Not really.
<Spider_Jerusalem> It was on my bed the entire time, while I turned my room upside down..
<Spider_Jerusalem> It was under a pillow
*FlaschenJoe11 *facehoof*
<GGgala_> XD
<Spider_Jerusalem> For my shame, I shall go brew coffee... Without turning the grinder function off.
*FlaschenJoe11 drinks coffee
<Spider_Jerusalem> How do you take your coffee?
<FlaschenJoe11> much sugar

<FlaschenJoe11> Hudson is aweseom

<FlaschenJoe11> derpy is less liked than discord?
<MakerDusk> discord is better liked than twilight XD
<Spider_Jerusalem> I'm sorry, but where the fuck is Tom?
<MakerDusk> (where is flutterbitch too!)
<FlaschenJoe11> Tom is too awesome for the list
<Fluttershy`> 08,1:<

<Spider_Jerusalem> Tom will be the only one on it. XD
<MakerDusk> something tell me Tom will be better liked than applejack
<FlaschenJoe11> Tom is a ROCK! A beautiful, beautyful Rock
<FlaschenJoe11> he should be on zeroth on the list
<MakerDusk> and here is the new list
<MakerDusk> https://gist.github.com/329a63cbbc7c8f8348c9
<MakerDusk> it seems like tom is better liked than flutterbitch
<CheesyLuna> I heard Discord was ground up into cupcakes
<GGgala_> Discord as an ingredient would probably give you Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Cupcakes...
<GGgala_> so he would troll ponies from the grave
<CheesyLuna> And only the worst flavours too
<FlaschenJoe11> i would love if a less powerful Discord could appear like Q and troll Twilight out of boredom
<CheesyLuna> Where can I find fanfics of Big Mac and Twilight
<CheesyLuna> ;D
<Spider_Jerusalem> The clopfic repository.
<GGgala_> i was gonna say...
<CheesyLuna> that sounds too..... cloppy for me
<Spider_Jerusalem> eeyup
<Spider_Jerusalem> Also. Hell yeah Flutterbitch.
<Spider_Jerusalem> You gave me the wingest boner.
<GGgala_> where are those numbers coming from? that was fast
<CheesyLuna> How many ponies were in the chat on the stream yesterday?
<GGgala_> i heard 1600+
<CheesyLuna> :O

<LordCelestia> I would stream if I could download stuff to this computer
<LordCelestia> but I can't download stuff to this computer
<Hat> I can stream but its okay if you don't let me
<Hat> I would probably show everyone all types of headgear
<LordCelestia> It's not really up to me. I'm not a moderator. I'm hoping to be one someday
<Hat> You have this anonymous brony's support
<LordCelestia> Thanks,
<anon> very interesting...
<Hat> OMC
<Hat> I have to get up at 1 oclock tomorrow
<LordCelestia> and I assume there's a completely different site with a BronyState password for streamers to access.
<LordCelestia> I think thats how it works at least.
<LordCelestia> OMC? huh?
<LordCelestia> What for?
<Hat> something other than bronystate :/

*Fluttershy` gets sucked to the cactus
<Pegacorn> You're dead to me.
<LordCelestia> Fluttershy`, do you like my new shoes?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1lawl XD
<Pegacorn> LordCelestia why is Renamon on fire?

<LordCelestia> ^ thanks
<Hat> Can I make a couple of suggestions
<Pegacorn> Die potato!
<LordCelestia> sure
<Hat> Maybe Twilight could have read about humans in a history book which makes her less surprised. At the moment she takes meeting an alien very calmly
<Pegacorn> I like trains.
<LordCelestia> She doesnt know right away that he's an alien.
<Hat> Ah I see
<Hat> Nice story!
<LordCelestia> Its like seeing a new animal. But talking creatures aren't new to them. Like the dragons
<LordCelestia> or buffalo

<Pegacorn> THE PIONEERS USED TO RIDE THESE BABIES FOR MILES,AND ITS IN GREAT SHAPE!
<EspyLacopa> Tom is our Destiny!
<EspyLacopa> Lead us Tom!
<Pegacorn> TOM
<EspyLacopa> All Hail Tom!
<FlaschenJoe11> Tom is better than best pony, He's bestest Pony
<Pegacorn> Sorry,but Megatron is best pony.
<EspyLacopa> He is the Über Pony.
<FlaschenJoe11> MegatronXPinkiePie
<FlaschenJoe11> search your feelings, you know it to be true
<Pegacorn> Flaschen,YOU ARE WIN
<FlaschenJoe11> Megatron is propably a brony
<EspyLacopa> What about Magneto?
<FlaschenJoe11> He is best Magnet
<Pegacorn> Magneto and Megatron tie for best pony.
<EspyLacopa> Which version of Megatron?
<FlaschenJoe11> Prime
<Pegacorn> Prime AND G1.
<FlaschenJoe11> Long Live Frank Walker (he was also in the G1 Pony movie I think)
<Pegacorn> FRANK WELKER IS BAWS
<EspyLacopa> I don't know, the Beast Wars Megatron was fun.
*FlaschenJoe11 Slams trout on his head since he messed up Welker's name
<FlaschenJoe11> Yeees
<FlaschenJoe11> ssss
<FlaschenJoe11> BWMegs had a Rubber Ducky (which was propably the real Leader)
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5KA8kmlfQs
<Pegacorn> ARE YOU READY FOR THE HOT NUTS
<FlaschenJoe11> Are you ready for the Fireflies in the Sky
*FlaschenJoe11 is propably wrong
<Hat> is there a way to automatically ID with the nickserv
<Pegacorn> I see that Espy is a Transformers fan.
<EspyLacopa> Of course.
<Pegacorn> Always good to have a Transformers fan around.
<FlaschenJoe11> we need a whooves ep with Ditzy/Derpy as extra
<FlaschenJoe11> Did you two also love the 80s movie of TF
*EspyLacopa has that on DVD
<Pegacorn> But of course.
<Pegacorn> Look out,here comes Megatron!
*Pegacorn pushes Megatron into the chat
*FlaschenJoe11 still refers to The Touch as the best power-up song ever
<EspyLacopa> One of these days, I'll get a proper Optimus Prime toy.
<Pegacorn> The Touch=Best movie song EVER.
<Hat> I like Zoids more than Transmorphers
<EspyLacopa> Pegacorn: GO-BOTS
<Pegacorn> **** Michael Bay
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<EspyLacopa> >_>
*EspyLacopa hides the bayformers dvds
<Pegacorn> Michael Bay is a terrible person.
<FlaschenJoe11> Bayformer's Optimus Prime is awesome though
<EspyLacopa> I went into the theatre expecting giant transforming robots beating the tar out of each other. And that's what I got.
<FlaschenJoe11> say what you want, what he did right was just incredibly good
<Pegacorn> Bumblebee was awesome too.
<EspyLacopa> And the second movie had even /more/ giant transforming robots beating the tar out of each other.
<EspyLacopa> Jetfire was best.
<FlaschenJoe11> and the third had an hour of giant robots beating the tar out of each other
<FlaschenJoe11> DE has now the Word
<Pegacorn> Nope.The second one had Megan Fox showing her ass and two dogs humping.And also Devastator showing off his balls.
<Denied_Existence> 3...ok..
<Pegacorn> BIRD IS THE WORD
<Denied_Existence> 3Pegacorn...I dont even want to know what the hell you are talking about
<EspyLacopa> It did?
<EspyLacopa> Huh. I must have missed it with all the fighting.
<Pegacorn> Son,i was talking about Bayformers.
<EspyLacopa> Yes, I know.
<FlaschenJoe11> I personally can't believe that Megan Fox refused to gain a few pounds above starvation for the role
<Pegacorn> BTW,when i said son,i was talking about Denied_Existence.
<EspyLacopa> Ah. I can barely read Denied_Existence's text. Dark text + Dark background = pain to read.
<EspyLacopa> Morning Luna.
<Denied_Existence> 3My green is dark?
<FlaschenJoe11> thanks to DJ Dash3r i now think of Twilight picking up some Artifact that makes her an Alicorn for a short time
<Luna> 07,1morning Espy
<Luna> 07,1good to see you again
<FlaschenJoe11> Hello Luna
<Pegacorn> Ohai Luna
<Luna> 07,1hello Flasch & Pega
*FlaschenJoe11 welcomes Luna with a friendly hug
<Luna> 07,1hmm someone tried to steal my nickname...
<Luna> 07,1-NickServ- Last failed attempt from: Luna!ledah@186.145.uu.sym on Sep 25 05:53:50 2011.
<FlaschenJoe11> Espy, Pega I personally loved the original Cartoon, and you?
<EspyLacopa> It has a special place in my heart.
<EspyLacopa> Looking back at it now, applying the standards of today? It's crap designed to sell toys. I still loved it though ^_^
<FlaschenJoe11> do you have a favourite TF?
<Pegacorn> G1 is one of the best series from my childhood.
<EspyLacopa> Personal favorite Transformer series is Beast Wars / Beast Machines
<EspyLacopa> Dinobot's "Code of Hero" episode was wonderful.
<FlaschenJoe11> I thought Prime, BB, Devastator and the Dinobots were the best
<Denied_Existence> 3Sadly I will not be able to be on here much until friday :(
<FlaschenJoe11> Dinobot in BW was awesome too
