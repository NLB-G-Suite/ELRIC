<Midnight_Tempest|FNV> ive been dreaming that im in the Fallout: Equestria universe... its surreal and awesome at the same time
<Polydunami> :O
<MASF123> That was a fanfic in ED
<Polydunami> I know
<AttackWithHugs> The last dream I had was in Avalar from Ripto's Rage
<MahBoi777> I dream of tubs of jelly
<Polydunami> Dang, my dreams can be rather perverse
<MASF123> Ah, before Spyro started to suck
<Polydunami> Ain't gonna say nothing about them
<MahBoi777> me gusta
*DeadpoolDash tacos
<Midnight_Tempest|FNV> my next dream is probably gonna be the same as the last... but now im probably gonna see samurai jack and timberwolves somewhere in it ._.
<MahBoi777> TACO TIEM
<Midnight_Tempest|FNV> burrito tiem
*MASF123 pony time
<Polydunami> You're waiting for a train...
<MahBoi777> NO.
<otakon> Wrek: are you happy now?
<Polydunami> Can't remember how the rest goes
<Wrek> 05hmm?
*DeadpoolDash chimichanga tiem
<AttackWithHugs> MASF123: Yep. It was Crush, Gulp, and Ripto chasing me through the reals and I reached a dead end and last thing I remember was Gulp opening his mouth
*Polydunami must watch Inception again
<MahBoi777> I'm waiting for a train? I hope it's full of tacos
<Midnight_Tempest|FNV> nope, spiders
<MahBoi777> damnit
*DeadpoolDash and fish
<Midnight_Tempest|FNV> spiderfishes
*Polydunami is okay with spiders
<Meanwhile> I like spiders.
<MASF123> Gulp is very dim-witted the only thing that reminds me of MLP in Spyro is Spike
<MahBoi777> EGAD brainfood!
<Polydunami> But I'd still rather have tacos
<Polydunami> Or sushi
<Wrek> 05come again otakon?
<Wrek> 05i gotta leave in a few minutes
<otakon> Wrek: ya done run off a chatter for no real reason.
<AttackWithHugs> But Spike actually shows intelligence, whereas Gulp is sort dimi.-witted, like you said
<Polydunami> Now now
<MahBoi777> no real raisin
*DeadpoolDash spider fish tacos...unshaven
<Meanwhile> wat.
<RainBroDash> 10>for no real reason Otakon, you must be tripping balls
<MASF123> No..I ment that Spike reminds me of Spyro himself
<otakon> What did she do?
<Wrek> 05are you drunk or something?
<otakon> no
<otakon> I'm not.
<otakon> then what did she do?
<AttackWithHugs> Ooohh. Makes sense. I will admit, I had a fangirl crush on Spyro when I was younger.
<otakon> what rules did she break?
*DeadpoolDash moist cures most
<MASF123> Aha!!! I knew you were a girl!
<MahBoi777> I broke a rule once
*DaringDude wants all bronies to get along :'(
*MahBoi777 prepares long-winded story
<RainBroDash> 10The entire chat was herp derpalerping over one person's innane rantings. When someone clogs the chat with 'I'm leaving, you're mean to me because of (x)' while quoting irrelevent 'evidence' (y), they are doing more harm than good for the chat :S
<Polydunami> Yep
<AttackWithHugs> Yep. I'm female. One day I'm going to buy the Spyro collection
<MASF123> Yeah, Spyro is awesome, just like Spike. They are such young dragons
<Meanwhile> One day I'm going to eat fugu
<DaringDude> lol Mahboi777 me too i got kicked lol
<Polydunami> And make sure it's properly prepared
<Meanwhile> And if it kills me I'm going to be mildly ticked off.
<Wrek> 05RainBroDash, skype if you please

*DaringDude is jealous of RainBroDash for being able to hear Wreks voice

<AttackWithHugs> VioletVanilla: I had a fangirl crush on Kakashi from Naruto when I was 13/14
<Meanwhile> I haven't played Spyro in forever.
*DeadpoolDash taste all the colors

<AttackWithHugs> MASF123: Get Year of the Dragon game. It is awesoome! You get to skateboard
<MASF123> I hatez the Naruto...conversation ended
<Meanwhile> Maybe he's born with it, maybe it's maybelline.
<Meanwhile> That's all I can hear when Neji is mentioned.
<MASF123> Yeah there are 3 demo levels
<MahBoi777> Mon Petit
<AttackWithHugs> And there's a cheat you can enter that will turn your skateboard into a squid. Dead serious.
<DaringDude> Phase4 lol dat robot
<Polydunami> Dang, I lost interest in Naruto about halfway through
<MASF123> Never heard of that cheat
*DaringDude is doing a physics lab
<MahBoi777> robots have taken over the Navy
<Meanwhile> I started reading Naruto when I learned it's further ahead and has no filler. I'm still reading it.
<Phase4> DaringDude: its trying again right now, hopefully it will go away and leave me alone
<AttackWithHugs> You can still look up the cheat codes for the Spyro trilogy online
<MASF123> I pretended to like it before to have my friends talk to me once. :(
<Polydunami> I had read the manga until part 2 and then I stopped

<Polydunami> Yep
<Meanwhile> True.
<Polydunami> Well, they expose exactly the wrong type of skin depending on where you're from
<AttackWithHugs> But I swear I saw a flash of underwear when they transformed into Sailor Scouts. Which probably explains my...weirdness...
<Meanwhile> It has to come to my attention that I really need some nutrition. Brb.
*Polydunami is a straight male. His first anime was Sailor Moon

<valoreins> :(
<ThatsAShinySky> Derp.
<Kammerjunk> The people of Moscow are hungry, but think what a feat there could be if we could create socialist state that cared for the people like me.
<ThatsAShinySky> Hey all
<ThatsAShinySky> Hi Snuffsis.
<valoreins> hiya
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk: Socialism is the devils work!! / some crazy american
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: Long live Lenin, kill the tsar! We salute the sickle and star!
<Snuffsis> You know what is awesome?
<Kammerjunk> Ponies.
<Snuffsis> Google X Offices, top secret laboratory
<valoreins> ^
<Snuffsis> Where they try to invent a space elevator, a fridge that is connected to the internet and automatically orders food when you're running low on it and several other things
<Snuffsis> I would totally want that fridge
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Kammerjunk> But what if I don't want it to?
<Kammerjunk> What if I just want a pizza?
<Snuffsis> I'm sure you can set it to order certain things and ignore other things. :P
<Snuffsis> Otherwise it would just order every singlt thing you don't have in your fridge
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Slerp.
<ThatsAShinySkyz> I have a refresher.
<Kammerjunk> So we reject free enterprise, and once again the left will rise.
<Snuffsis> hnn?
<Kammerjunk> Prepare the flags to be unfurled, 'cause we're seceding from the world. We shall regain the Georgian soil. We shall obtain the Arctic oil.
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Dafuq. My phone fell out. of my habd
<Kammerjunk> Good job.
<Snuffsis> http://www.google.com/patents?id=FX-FAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false this is how the fridge will work
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Pokerface
<Cypresswolf> a fridge integrated with the internet, NICE! Im sure it has a built in computer, by the sound of it, where you can order whatever you want
<Kammerjunk> I hope I can put it on "pause".
<ThatsAShinySkyz> It's already in existence.
<ThatsAShinySkyz> I have one.
<Snuffsis> Check the flowchart i just posted kammerjunk. you can set it to ignore
<Kammerjunk> Neat-o.
<valoreins> but how does the physics work, right now we could only send bits of information using internet, not in physical form... :(
<Kammerjunk> Set minimum proper amount of stored food article = -1
<Kammerjunk> I want to see what happens.
<Snuffsis> It checks if there is few traces of amounts of whatever you want in your fridge, if so, it outputs ordering info on the screen, wherre you can choose to ignore purchase or procdd
<ThatsAShinySkyz> I just introduced a guy to MLP. Win?
<Kammerjunk> Good on ya.
<Snuffsis> valoreins... They would obviously connect to stores that deliver food to your doorstep... :P
<Kammerjunk> I still can't believe that at the protest against ACTA I was to the 25th, no one recognised my Dashie shirt.
<Snuffsis> Haha
<valoreins> i thought it works like teleport the food to the fridge lol
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Lol.
<Kammerjunk> Seriously. It's like the Internet gathered in the capital, and no one knew about ponies.
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Haha. Shame on them.
<Snuffsis> valoreins. that would be fucking awesome, but then that wouldn't lead to just fridges, we'd be able to teleport to the moon and other things... :P
<valoreins> i was thinking in sci-fi way 6_9
<Snuffsis> Like the Star Trek replicating device?
<Kammerjunk> Actually, I think it's very likely that we achieve the ability to freaking teleport, and then we use it for our fridges.
<ThatsAShinySkyz> The moon is boring. There are no ponies there. Luna isn't there anymore.
<Kammerjunk> That sounds very human to me.
<Snuffsis> tea, earl grey, hot
<valoreins> i thought there are rebel ponies in the moon
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Wut.
<valoreins> that would be awesome :D
<Kammerjunk> Thank you for reminding me, Snuffsis, I have not had a cup today.
<emangamer> lulz....

<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
<ofna01> BOY
<NowCarefulDerpy> Now that we are on TF2, i always for some reason thought of Discord as the Medic.
<Sumica> 00,10So yeah, Rarity is spy right?
<NowCarefulDerpy> I have no clue why.
<Jim> Rarity is best spy
<ofna01> THAT PRANCIN SHOW PONY IS A SPY
<Kammerjunk> NowCarefulDerpy: That's terrifying and awesome at the same time.
<Wrek> 05twi is best sniper
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Sumica> 00,10And Dash is scout.
<ofna01> dash is best scout
<ofna01> but rainbows make scout cry
<Jim> Applejack is best engineer
<ofna01> so how would that work?
<Kammerjunk> I always saw Spike as the Soldier, to be honest.
<ofna01> LOLNO
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: That was obviously Rarity making fun of Dashie.
<ofna01> Spike is Demoman
<herp-a-derp> no no
<NowCarefulDerpy> Fluttershy is best sentry
<ofna01> O_O
<Sumica> 00,10so what does that meen Rarity slept with Dashes mom?
<ofna01> DEMODEMOPAN!
<herp-a-derp> zecora is demoman
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I don't really know why I saw Spike as the Soldier.
<Jim> http://img.ponibooru.org/images/3d/3d57f1a1f40278b3fcd0b038342f33b7
<ofna01> demopan ftw
<ofna01> DEMODEMOPAN!
<ofna01> D:
<Kammerjunk> I guess I like how he looks in the Soldier's cap.
<ofna01> heavy!
<Kammerjunk> goddammitdaribot?
<ofna01> i love this video
<Jim> Bronystate TF2 nights in a nutshell
<Kammerjunk> Our Demoknights shall block out the Sun!

<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1AVVKUuj3k&feature=related
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<TrixieMuffin> there exists a pic of Pinky Pie as pyro with spitfireas the flamethrower
<ofna01> lol
<Kammerjunk> Our arrows will block out the Sun!
<Jim> Heavyquest
<NowCarefulDerpy> Fluttershy as the medic..that's..i guess that fits too.
<RawketLawnchair> Bum ba num bumma nun, nunna hunna.
<ofna01> NO
<Kammerjunk> NowCarefulDerpy: No, I think I like Discord as the Medic.
<ofna01> Fluttershy is Medic
<RawketLawnchair> Brodyquest.
<RawketLawnchair> Such a catchy tune.
<Kammerjunk> It fits in with my already oatmeal-filled headcanon.
<NowCarefulDerpy> friendship is medic
<Jim> RawketLawnchair: IKR
<ofna01> its on! its on like.....zzzzz
<RawketLawnchair> Also, I drew a pony.
<herp-a-derp> fluttershys personality doesnt really fit medic though :/
<Jim> may we see RawketLawnchair ?
<RawketLawnchair> http://i40.tinypic.com/140xkt5.jpg Look, it is a pony.
<ofna01> ping
<Jim> Cool :)
<Kammerjunk> Wait.
<ofna01> huh,wha?
<RawketLawnchair> Drawing with a mouse is hard.
<Kammerjunk> I can suddenly load tinypic.
<NowCarefulDerpy> RawketLawnchair: Yes it is.
<Kammerjunk> How is this possible.
<ofna01> that sniper is a spy
<Kammerjunk> RawketLawnchair: Tell that to Wrek.
<RawketLawnchair> Wrek is full of hacks.
<NowCarefulDerpy> Tell me about it, i always seem to draw out the line when i attempt to draw with my mouse.
<ofna01> leeeeeets doooiiiiiit!
<RawketLawnchair> I did what I could. And it's not that bad, but it's not that good either.
<RawketLawnchair> I will draw Derpy next.
<Kammerjunk> Stout Shako for two refined!
<ofna01> not one of you is gonna survive this!
<NowCarefulDerpy> I personally think that drawing is nice.
<ofna01> demopan? *smack*
<ofna01> LOL
<Kammerjunk> I need about 4 weapons for a random hat.
<Kammerjunk> I'll go play TF2.
<RawketLawnchair> It team time.

<NowCarefulDerpy> I totally vote for Hats of Harmony
<Kammerjunk> I always mess up when trying to draw the neck of ponies.
<Kammerjunk> NowCarefulDerpy: I approve this notion.

<ofna01> if i wanna make fun of someone i use scout
<herp-a-derp> dat egineer
<RawketLawnchair> Team balance.

<Kammerjunk> Team balance is such a party-pooper.

<NewDCD> 09,01You know what we streamers REALLY hate?
<NewDCD> 09,01when we get heckled.
<NewDCD> 09,01We don't get paid for streaming y'know, so yeah.
<sharklion> YMCA rangers
<Pinkieruler124> Pleaseeeeeeeeee....NewDCD.......Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee.....
<applejack096> wtf is this???
<Saturn> 08,01NewDCD: put on star trek! put on andromeda! put on kamen rider! pleeeeeeeeeasassasasae!
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<applejack096> NOOOO
<Phase4> applejack096: i think its power rangers
<Starflash> NewDCD dont worry, we love you for streaming Gokaiger.
<Sundaysmile> Wouldn't take it personally DCD, I usually like to sit back and make fun of everything I watch like I'm on MST3K
<Saturn> 08,01what are you all watching?
<Jim> Gokaiger
<AttackWithHugs> I realize that the shows I had no intrest for as a kid I would actually watch now.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> japanese power rangers while im drawing? "im ok with this"
<sharklion> go elements of harmoney!
<NewDCD> 09,01that's fine, but do you have any idea how much our streamers get bothered for the shows they stream .___. or the original content they make
*Phase4 hugs NewDCD
<Saigneur> Uncheck, i don't get it :o
<sharklion> I'm not copmplaining, it's awesome
<RainbowJack> NewSCD Star trek episode
<Pinkieruler124> Im tierd of this........
*MelaPonie licks Pinkieruler124
<RainbowcrashNBurn> why would anyone complain about something being done for them for free?
<Sundaysmile> yes, I see it everything I'm here. So I guess that's why Dari has so much fun trolling the audience
<Pinkieruler124> RJ Is right
<Phase4> crossing the 7 seas in a flying ship
<Phase4> seems legit
<Jim> RainbowcrashNBurn: Because people are weird
<NewDCD> 09,01exactly. EVERY FREAKIN' DAY .___.
<Pinkieruler124> Look we are tierd of this...
<Phase4> people complain?
<Phase4> thats news to me
<sharklion> who's complaining?
<NewDCD> 09,01no, you are : I
<Sundaysmile> What doesn't kill you or grind your brain into paste from consistant irritation, only makes you stronger
<NewDCD> 09,01and as I said
<Saigneur> pirate ranger !!!!
<NewDCD> 09,01if you don't like it, go do something else
<Sundaysmile> or more willing to troll
*Pinkieruler124 Covers phase's mouth
<Cypresswolf> I like alot of what the stremers show. Most of it are things Ive never heard of. This one included. I havent watched power rangers in years, had no idea the show has gotten this good
*Phase4 isnt trying to and is sorry if it seems that way
<Saigneur> captain mare do well
<sharklion> Exactly, this is awesome to many people, Love or Tolerate it!
<Phase4> not disliking it, just new to me
<Pinkieruler124> Sorry for that :(
<NewDCD> 09,01personally I don't like the whole "Love and Tolerance" thing
<NewDCD> 09,01but that's just me
<NewDCD> 09,01Luka MILFy
<Pinkieruler124> :'(
<sharklion> It can get a bit pretentious
<NewDCD> 09,01the main problem with it
<RoboGerbil> if violence doesnt solve all your problems, you arent using enough
<AttackWithHugs> I admit, I never took a liking to Power rangers, but that was because my little brother would annoy me with it.
<Sundaysmile> I do. Because it annoys the crap outta folk that try to annoy you.
<Jim> AttackWithHugs: And if that doesn't work, use duct tape
<Pinkieruler124> IM RIDEING SOLO!!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 09,01is that Bronies confuse "Tolerance" with "Moral Blindness"
<sharklion> feelin like a star
<sharklion> you can't stop my shine
<Phase4> RoboGerbil: obviously what you need to do then is AttackWithHugs :P
<NewDCD> 09,01and "Love" is not something that should be given freely, it should be earned, when bonds are made between people
<AttackWithHugs> Jim: This was years ago when I was about 9 years old. He had about every Power rangers action figure
<Cypresswolf> That dude is AWESOME!
<Saturn> 08,01NewDCD: exactly. one wouldn't "tolerate" hitler.
<Pinkieruler124> Newborn cutie's ! Newborn cutie"s!
<AttackWithHugs> He even had one that comes up to my thigh. But he grew out the phase
<BritishBrony> Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mfw GOKAIGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
<NewDCD> 09,01but if you don't "manufacture" these two things, chances are you'll be ostracized from the fandom
*Tovler|Twibfm wields Love and Tolerance like a club and hits haters with it.
<Sundaysmile> So by that logic, you should recieve before you give?
<NewDCD> 09,01so pretty much
<applejack096> g2g bye
<sharklion> I agree with you NewDCD
<Pinkieruler124> Britsh!
<Saturn> 08,01intolerence is how revolution is born
<AttackWithHugs> I think I'll start watching it
<Phase4> hai SaxyPretender
<NewDCD> 09,01"Love and Tolerate, or we'll Isolate you"
<Saturn> 08,01and revolution is something very dear to my heart
<RoboGerbil> so theres no streams up?
<NewDCD> 09,01it's a hypocritical mantra
*MelaPonie nibbles on Pinkieruler124
<NewDCD> 09,01Gerbil: refresh
<BritishBrony> Haider pinkie.
<Jim> There is a stream
<Pinkieruler124> Lets look at the show
<Phase4> rage!
<RoboGerbil> ah, wasnt loading for me
<Jim> What's that huge thing on his head?
<sharklion> but the whole point of 'Love and Tolereate' is in the sense in that you shouldn't annoy someone for no reason and you should try to like them even if it's hard
<Saturn> 08,01NewDCD: though, that said, i think it's meant to be metaphorical; it's the value of it that matters, not the blind following of the principle
<NewDCD> 09,01dat King of Braves voice
*applejack096 leaves for real
<Tovler|Twibfm> It's a passive-aggressive conditioned response.
*MelaPonie bites Pinkieruler124
<applejack096> BYEE
<AttackWithHugs> Jim: I think that huge thing IS his head
<Phase4> later applejack096
<NewDCD> 09,01it sounds good in principle
<BritishBrony> What is this... I don't... *Head blows up*
<MelaPonie> bye again applejack096
<Pinkieruler124> Owww!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14finally, I can partake in one of the old BronyState tradition
<NewDCD> 09,01but honestly it doesn't work in real life
<sharklion> saddest moment ever
*MelaPonie goes back to nibbling on Pinkieruler124
<Phase4> speaking of which i need to go now too, bbl #bronystate
<Pinkieruler124> DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
<Jim> bye Phase4
<MelaPonie> die? who?
<Saturn> 08,01i interpret it as "love and tolerate unless it's undeserved"
<Pinkieruler124> Really.....
<Saigneur> well , this power ranger is weird, c u later
<NewDCD> 09,01quite frankly love is a mutual feeling that develops after we interact with other people.
<MelaPonie> what kind of die pinkie pie?
<sharklion> sya
<sharklion> indeed
<MelaPonie> Pinkie DIEanne Pie?
<Saturn> 08,01and "be kind about how you determine deservedness"

<Stallion_of_War> I thought swords caused massive amounts of death, until I learned rails were deadlier.
<unfoundbug> have the emails for this weeks lottery gone out?

<Stallion_of_War> unfoundbug - yes
<alexxm> i already voted so yeah
<GokaiCanary> And this is why Joe get's all the ladies.
<Stallion_of_War> Japanese pirate power rangers

<RainBroDash> 10Brit, I'm from Maidenhead, near Reading. But I go to uni (and live) in Brighton, East Sussex
<sharklion> I just liten to this and it's all better
<PinkieSpice> no more streaming?
<CrimsonFoxx> Yep, I've only been able to fool Akinator a few times, and they were pretty abstract characters
<BritishBrony> Aweshum.
<Dark__Horst> REPAAAAAAAAAAAAIR IT! my brain can't stand this absemnce of madness
<GokaiCanary> Well there was a stream. But it went poof.
<Phase4> sharklion: theres a 10 hour version too xD

<sharklion> it's awesomesauce

<alexxm> so if that brighton meets on you'd go to it then
<BritishBrony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aih_-483uVk

<CrimsonFoxx> Otakon: Not a good idea, the more popular something is, the easier it is for him to guess
<Dark__Horst> the akinator knows EVRYTHING
<Dark__Horst> you can't beat him with ponies
<RainbowJack> What are you doing here get back to the hospital

<otakon> Dark__Horst: what should I try then?
<Dark__Horst> a PONY is supposed to slip his knowledge? won't ahppen
<CrimsonFoxx> The key to beating Akinator is to think of a character that you wouldn't ordinarily think of right away
<otakon> Okya
<BritishBrony> Nice try, Rainbro.

<otakon> being a fan of anime does not make him a weeaboo
*Phase4 wishes he could continue to watch but he has work to do :(

<Sumica> 00,10So is any one listening to DCD tell the story or just enjoying the acting?
<otakon> Iwubponiez: major otaku-gasm's
<emangamer> I'm pretty sure GokaiCanary has been cracking up this entire time
<RainbowJack> he has power Rangergasums
<otakon> Sumica: the acting, too much damn lag
<otakon> GokaiCanary: you okay?
<GokaiCanary> Yes :3
<GokaiCanary> I am super pleased.
<kenne88> In modern Japanese slang, the term otaku is most often equivalent to "geek".[3] However, it can relate to a fan of any particular theme, topic, hobby or any form of entertainment.[4] this is what i got and it sounds pretty similair
<emangamer> Sumica: I'm listening to the story, but I've read it twice. so I'm enjoying both
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: wish i could but then it will pile up and i will fail uni :(
<RainbowJack> You must have some GUNDANMS NewDCD
<RainbowJack> mechina?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 D: then work fast~ :) so you can watch DCD
<kenne88> haha i knew it lol!
<RainbowJack> I love Anime
<Sumica> 00,10ah, I dont even know what he's saying. the music is kinda loud.
<GokaiCanary> XD If you wanted to be Japanese then you'd be a Weeaboo.
<unfoundbug> phase, you could get another monitor and do both work and bronystate
<GokaiCanary> LIEK OMG KAWAII DESUUU
<otakon> kenne88: no, a weeaboo is someone OBSESSED with popular japanese culture to the point of wishing they were Japanese.
<emangamer> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-alright-then-we-will-wait.jpg
<Yahooz> Guys, should I send some of these to the bronystategmail? XDDDD

<otakon> ezio: original form of the power rangers.
<emangamer> you know, I dont know why, but I get the feeling that this show has some product placement
<emangamer> well
<alexxm> you don't say
<emangamer> not product placement
<Starflash> otakon not that hard, right :3
<emangamer> but advertisement
<RainbowJack> I see NewDCD swinging on this song right now
<Dken2021> sounds a bit like the DBZKai theme
<otakon> emangamer: what clues you in? the CONSTANT action figures they pull out of no where?
<otakon> Seriously
<Coolbluemidnite> lalalalalalala

<ScootaChicken> otakon: it's called My Little Pony Friendship is Magic
<emangamer> ^
<otakon> thanks ezio mfw I am already subscribed to Funimation
<Dken2021> My little pony? what's that?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01washes up.

<otakon> Snuffsis: not too much
<otakon> damn
<Phase4> dat explosion
<GokaiCanary> emangamer: He learned it from Barizog.
<Phase4> that left no evidence of its existance
*Nittany_Discord 11,01cooks ScootaChicken
<GokaiCanary> Aka, Cid, Joe's mentor and friend.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm OK.
<otakon> Fully cybernetic is bullshit
<emangamer> GokaiCanary: oh...I didnt think thats how that worked
<Snuffsis> So much drama
<Phase4> we're having ScootaChicken tonight
<Starflash> T_T...
<ThatsAShinySky> Oh wow. I'm Proofreading for a female model.

<robotdragon6> " And lo I saw a premanition. I saw the final battle for the internet in which a monster with the name of ACTA rose up against all surfers, bronies, trolls, bloggers, surfers, furries, otakus, mods, and haters. They combined and formed a warrior who shouted LEROY JENKINS! and struck the beast in the heart. when it was over everyone celebrated with the nyan cat song...."

<RainbowcrashNBurn> ScootaChicken: run! before your eaten
<Dark__Horst> that is an interesting Y in my word
<robotdragon6> sry
<otakon> robotdragon6: that wall of text, YES!
<emangamer> he may be over reacting
<Phase4> robotdragon6: that is exactly how it will happen
<Snuffsis> Canarys hero got bitchslapped.
<GokaiCanary> Oh no.

<Phase4> another explosion that leaves no trace
*Nittany_Discord 11,01glomps emangamer
*emangamer is glomped
<emangamer> ooph
<RaveBrony> :o
<otakon> RaveBrony: um I have NO idea what that is, but I'd like to help
<robotdragon6> i havent watched ponies for 3 DAYS
<emangamer> how are you doing Nittany_Discord ?
<Globetrotter> No one ever glomps me.
*ScootaChicken glomps Globetrotter
<robotdragon6> NNNOOO
<ScootaChicken> like a sir.
<Globetrotter> Yay!
<Dark__Horst> ...not creepy at all
*ScootaChicken adjusts his monocle
<ScootaChicken> ahem.
<ekips> everyone is getting glomped
<Yahooz> Alright, im off to do some work. I have a file of about 20 of the best of the screen shots I got, so when I come on next time, Pm me if you want it, kay?
<otakon> robotdragon6: you are suffering from a Vitamin P defincency, you need PONIES!
<Snuffsis> Why did the enemy minions just stand there while those two were casually talking?
*Globetrotter glomps ekips
<otakon> see ya Yahooz have fun!
<Sumica> 00,10Off to work, catch you all later.
<Snuffsis> Makes no sense. T_T
*RainbowcrashNBurn hides from the glomping
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01emangamer: Fine.
<robotdragon6> *gets vitamins*
*unfoundbug glomps everyone "SUPPRISE"
<ScootaChicken> bye Sumica and Yahooz :3
<emangamer> bye Sumica <3
<otakon> Snuffsis: bc that's how it works
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Later Sumica ~
<alexxm> cya Sumica
<RaveBrony> Im trying to record my audio to send in for the chorus of a fan made Derpy version of "Smile".... but im not Entirely sure what to record.... what the Actual song sounds like...or how the girl sung the song in the vid
*otakon is not glomped
<ScootaChicken> RainbowcrashNBurn: I'm totally glomping you next brony meetup
<otakon> bye Sumica
<ekips> I don't even know what "glomp" is ~.~
<RaveBrony> eek....sorry for that wall
<GokaiCanary> Bye Sumica!
<Snuffsis> otakon: That's not really a valid argument. xD
*Yahooz glomps otakon goodbye
<emangamer> lets see
<Dark__Horst> their technology is flawed
<SuperBrony64> Bai Sumica!
<otakon> Snuffsis: your arguement is invalid as was the glomp
<Phase4> later Sumica
<NewDCD> 09,01>Power Rangers will never be this epic
<emangamer> it takes 6 mA of current to kill a human
<kenne88> agreed
<Snuffsis> Terminator is on a unicorn, your argument is invalid
<emangamer> adding a second person approxmately doubled the resistance3
<RainbowcrashNBurn> ScootaChicken: i dont know how to react to that :O
<Phase4> i thought this was power rangers
<otakon> RaveBrony: look it up then record the chorus while watching the video I suppose?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Typical lightning currents are 30 kA (lower, really).
<emangamer> so we'll assume that the collar gave more than 6 mA though
<robotdragon6> did someone say resistance 3?
<otakon> Seriously, WHERE IS THE DAMN ARMY?
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: whats a good figure.... 10mA?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I dunno.
<otakon> Your telling me Earth on has ONE PERSON to defend it?
<emangamer> so that means they each had 5 mA running through their body
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01An Amp is bad.
<Derpy101> Hi :P
<otakon> she's sure as hell isnt' Superman!
<Snuffsis> otakon: That isn't earth though, is it?
<otakon> hiya Derpy101
<robotdragon6> EY
<emangamer> thats enough to give them both heart attacks strong enough to kill them
<otakon> Snuffsis: it is Earth
<Phase4> this looks a lot like power rangers
<RoseyPony> hello derpy101
<Snuffsis> Otakon: Hmm, ok.
<Phase4> hi Derpy101
<ekips> emangamer don't try to apply physics to any shows on tv
<otakon> Phase4: it is, just in it's original form
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: not always...sometimes you want high current and low voltage...
<RoflBot> lol why we watching japanese power rangerS?
<GokaiCanary> Awww`
<GokaiCanary> Because reasons.
<Derpy101> idk XD
<emangamer> ekips: what about the big bang theory
<kenne88> RoflBot: becuase its amazing
<otakon> RoflBot: bc it's wonderfully over the top
<alexxm> why not Roflbot
<Snuffsis> Everytime you try to bring in real life physics in a series, god kills a catgirl
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: thats why transformers are used
<Snuffsis> Please think of the catgirls
<ekips> I'm not watching big bang theory emangamer
<kenne88> RoflBot: on another note why arent you?
<unfoundbug> dont try to apply phyics to any medium meant for entertainment
<ekips> ^
<emangamer> did they say... DARI ranger???
<RoflBot> yup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01High voltage isn't bad.
<unfoundbug> tv/film/games all deliberately break physics
<Snuffsis> haha
<Phase4> prince-dari the ranger
<NewDCD> 09,01Dai. Dai means "great"
<GokaiCanary> See, this is why I love Joe's character. He's loyal to his team, and has his demons, too.
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: no it isnt bad, but it will fry most electronics
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord: i think the cutoff is 30ma, everyone tells you a different number
<RoflBot> makes me wonder of these actors really know kung fu or its stunt doubles
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i remember that one ~
<GokaiCanary> HNNNG Hurrikenger!!
<emangamer> Phase4: cutoff for what?
<NewDCD> 09,01MEEEEEEEEEEEEEGARANGER
<Phase4> emangamer: heart attack
<RoflBot> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well you don't want high potentials in current-based electronics obviously.
<Snuffsis> haha MEGARANGER and then she comes and interrupts it
<emangamer> Phase4: it takes 6 mA across the heart to kill somone
<Snuffsis> that is such a troll
<ekips> Rampage :o
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: yea...enter transformers
<GokaiCanary> <3 Abaranger is my favorite.
<otakon> what was that noise?
<Derpy101> GOOOOOOOOOOOORANGER
<Phase4> emangamer: refference? everyone tells me somethign different
<Globetrotter> he looks like a bug.
<Starflash> otakon you dont want to know :>
<RainbowcrashNBurn> dat ding?
<GokaiCanary> Just like Kamen Rider, :3
<emangamer> Phase4: the mythbusters episode yesterday
<Snuffsis> Ohranger? xD

<otakon> Starflash: it sounded like a bat.
<NewDCD> 09,01I love Liveman <3
<otakon> OhGreen?
<GokaiCanary> Yes.
<otakon> WTF is OhGreen?
<Phase4> emangamer: ah, k
<RainbowJack> bye bye every pony
<Snuffsis> No no, Oh! Great!
<otakon> Liveman?!
<ekips> Oh, Green ~
<emangamer> unfoundbug: would you like me to put 6 mA across YOUR heart?
<Starflash> Call ALL the transformations
<otakon> I am SO CONFUSED
<GokaiCanary> Dem fists.
<emangamer> when did we start to watch Megaman?
<RoflBot> lol just 1 gun makes all the difference
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> too many rangers i don't even know ~
<Starflash> Maaawn
<Snuffsis> Oh = King in japanese though, so it makes sense

<emangamer> unfoundbug: pfft...what a hipster
<unfoundbug> Dken2021, clouds
<Phase4> burned away their outfits
<ScootaChicken> 'An Amp is bad.'
<otakon> and de-powered in ONE attack
<Silver_Streak> boom
<otakon> that is NOT a good sign
<ScootaChicken> not when you're a guitarist.
<RoflBot> OH SNAP
<otakon> If it was me
<otakon> I would have killed them by now
<Derpy101> XD
<unfoundbug> ScootaChicken careful on the capitalization for that :P
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: thats an amplifier...we're talking about ampieres
<otakon> hiya Silver_Streak wb
<unfoundbug> Amp is bad for people, amp good for guitarists
<Silver_Streak> hi otakon
<RoflBot> DAT PLASTIC RING
<ScootaChicken> unfoundbug: I'm quoting Nittany_Discord, deliberately leaving the capital like that.
<unfoundbug> though Hv is just plain cool
<Capn_fisty> thats a massive polo
<Phase4> Ampea vs Amplifier
<Phase4> ones current the other is 'volume'
<otakon> RoflBot: it's actually the hilt guard for a sword IIRC
<RainbowcrashNBurn> the shock collar was ages ago.....still debating about that?
<unfoundbug> lol volume
<GokaiCanary> <3 Shinken Red.
<Derpy101> British soilder suit 0_o
<RoflBot> a hilt guard?
<otakon> RoflBot: yeah

<Dark__Horst> i'm getting the feeling this captain dude is supposed to rip off a certain torchwood character
<emangamer> NewDCD is best fanboy
<Phase4> i dont remember guns in power rangers
<Snuffsis> Feels like my stream is a bit after.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> why dont they re-power?
<Snuffsis> Power Rangers had a big gun
<Snuffsis> when they combined everything into a cannon

<CCCP> CrazyBronyDonut: I have seen it before but that is still AMZING! OMG I <3 U!!!
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord: is this the windows 8 thing?
<SilverStreak> MelaPonie didn't know about cupcakes
<Snuffsis> PAssword-protected bios is really simple to break through though, atleast from my experience.
<kenne88> not a single tear was she that day
<CrazyBronyDonut> cool CCCP
<kenne88> shed*
<mario_pony> megazords!
<Dumori> Nittany_Discord you looked for the factory default for you Mboard/bios
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm using a comparison on how dumb and practically worthless the idea is.
<Meanwhile> YourLittleDashie: you did not succeed.
<CCCP> YourLittleDashie: :'(
<DeadlyDerp3> And not a single tear was SHIT that day
<RoboGerbil> lol nittany, just pull the bios battery and reset the bios, that should get rid of any passwords
<Brony4Life> YourLittleDashie: not cring just empty inside thats all
<Randomnerd> Groan.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RoboGerbil: That's the only option I see from online searches.
<YourLittleDashie> Brony4Life: Oh well
<SilverStreak> Just told her hehehe
<otakon> Basco?
<otakon> really?
<YourLittleDashie> CCCP: *Dashie hugs you*
<unfoundbug> drm keeps stock holders happy, even if it doesnt fulfill its primary purpose
<CCCP> :)
<Dumori> Basco is badass
<Jim> Panic Navi ^^
<Jookia> Richard Stallman advises you to use no passwords
<Meanwhile> Hey listen!
<Phase4> if what Nittany_Discord is talking about is the windows 8 signed boot its a bit more than a password and a lot more scary. if its just a normal pc being sold now then its silly
<otakon> unfoundbug: eeyup
<Frostfire> Hey Hey Listen
<Dumori> don't dis Basco Ottercan he'll fuck you up hard
<RoboGerbil> nittany, is it a dell?
<Jookia> Phase4: the first rule about secureboot is not to talk about it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4: It's an old XP Media Center model.
<Meanwhile> Nice ringtone.
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord: ah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What's this about W8 signed boots?
<Jookia> i love how green starts running before everybody else
<Phase4> Jookia: legaly we cant talk about it if your in america
<Snuffsis> Phase4: The windows 8 thing is supposedly really simple to just turn off though. It's just there to prevent people from accidentally altering anything when they don't know what they are doing.
<unfoundbug> windows 8 was ruined as soon as they said "metro ui"
<Jookia> Phase4: i live in australasia
<Phase4> Snuffsis: on x86 machines, not on arm
<SuperBrony64> "Let's remove a bunch of features from Home and through in a fancy interface for Windows Media Player and call it Windows XP Media Center Edition!!"
<Derpy101> ill brb guys, i have to do homework T_T:|
<Dumori> windows 8 looks like ass
<Phase4> Jookia: AUS BRONY
<Jim> have fun Derpy101
<SuperBrony64> throw*
<CrazyBronyDonut> Im not liking the look of Windows 8 either
<RoboGerbil> nittany_discord if its a dell theres a separate bios jumper on the mb to lock the bios
<Jookia> windows 8 boot in a nutshell is that your computer will only run what the manufacturer approves
<CCCP> does anypony here have a mac?
*Phase4 hugs Jookia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's Toshiba.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*a
<CrazyBronyDonut> think ill stick with 7 until 9
<Phase4> Jookia: i'm australian
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The HD stopped functioning this morning.
<Jookia> Phase4: I'd brohoof you but I can't be arsed typing /me

<Phase4> Arch linux!
<Darf14> I use Ubuntu, Its good once you fix it up a bit
<Randomnerd> Nittany_Discord: okay, I'm not really using it for anything important, I'll take your word for it.
<Meanwhile> Basco, if he didn't talk I'd assume he's a chick.
<SuperBrony64> I own a Mac ^_^
<Snuffsis> Ubuntu is nice

<Dumori> Tir Na Gog now I know my celtic myth

<Dumori> but I didn't knwo there was a rangers for it
<Meanwhile> Wasn't it Tir Na Nog?
<Dumori> I might have to check it out
<Dumori> if it's decent
<Starflash> I think Tir Na Nog, yeah

<Dumori> of god the pink battle fever
<Dumori> that is creepy man

<Dumori> It's just a bladed trident
<CriticKitten> This is pretty much the same sort of goofy fun attitude.
<Aircrafter> I've learned...I am soshwart :L
<GokaiSilver> Also, a friend of mine was actually supposed to draw a picture of chibi me with chibi Gai, LAST YEAR but she never got to it but she got to other drawings....
<Dark__Horst> nope, a spear with an axe head is a pike
<CriticKitten> Crap, he's got an AT field~
<Meanwhile> GokaiSilver: Surprisingly, I kinda know that feel.
<Dark__Horst> a trident is a spear with three tips. three = tri
<Dark__Horst> get it?
<GokaiSilver> It was supposed to be me giving Gai a peck on the cheek and him blushing.
*kenne88 feels like a boss knowing what gokaiger and super sentai was before streaming episodes
<Dumori> Insan is epic troll!
<Aircrafter> lol just desserts
