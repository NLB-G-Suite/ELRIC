<MahBoi777> it's all ur fault RaveBrony, lol jk
<RaveBrony> D:
<Michael> boooooring
<Malavolent> Lil_B: It still sounds nice. What I'm afraid of is that in the Czech dubbing the names will be translated too. I don't know if you know even a little of czech language but it would sound horrible.
<Rukario> :/
<cachi01> one does not simply get bored in bronystate
<Nerom> Refreshed the whole page no stream D:
<MahBoi777> nnnnnope
<Lil_B> Malavolent also, Sweete bells version of "Hush Hush" in the german version sounds awesome, but i think thats also because the Cutemark Crusaderas have adult voiceactors http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Wp0Y4Asr4
<Michael> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4926/
<RaveBrony> Refreshed, pressed play, and still nothing (If it helps)
<Litwick> ((Why is everypony talking like there's a stream?))

<cachi01> idk
<MahBoi777> just the buffer show for me
<flutter_spin> lol Michael
<RaveBrony> Litwick: I think Wrek is trying to stream, but im not sure >.<
<drf-Droid> just gotta get through 1 hour...
<Rukario> yay for new toys
<cachi01> i just see the adventures of the buffering circle
<flutter_spin> There was a second I thought there was stream, but nope
<Malavolent> Lil_B: That is pretty neat.
<owlicious> This is the most beautiful spinning circle you've done, Wrek. It looks almost as if it's moving
<Lil_B> Malavolent I know what you mean, in the Preview trailer of the dub they had some names Translated and it sounded horrible
<FillyFlam> cachi01: Oh man, I love that show!
<alexxm> whats it doing today cachi01
<MahBoi777> cachi01: eh, it got boring after the first 3 seasons
<flutter_spin> Look at the buffer go!
<RaveBrony> :D
<cachi01> FillyFlam MahBoi777 xD alexxm he is doing the usual rolling till he gets tired lol
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Something like RoseKuchen? :D
<crazypony> the buffer is chasing its tail
<owlicious> G1 buffering was better
<MahBoi777> lol
<FillyFlam> Oh man, again? I think he's addicted.
<Wrek> 05i like the lack of "stream died" yells when it happened then
<cachi01> we are broffers!
<Malavolent> Lil_B: or RosenKuchen? I haven't practiced my German for some time.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dat compliment
<TheRainbowDash> Hmmm? Oh...
<flutter_spin> I haven't seen any stream since I walked in
<cachi01> bro + buffer = broffers
<flutter_spin> since 14:17 actually
<Michael> lol cachi01
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames and explodes
<MahBoi777> i c wat u did thar

<Wrek> 05cause no one told me
<flutter_spin> ohhhh. ok wrek
<cachi01> lol
<Kimori> hi stormy
<Malavolent> Dayum shame.
<Lil_B> Malavolent the one I remember was that they translated "The Mare in the Moon" to "Die Stute im Mond" it's true that it's 100% accurate translation, but it stull sounds so wrong
<owlicious> Best Bruffer Friends Forever
<Stormy> hey
<RaveBrony> Damn it! >.<
<MahBoi777> Wrek: stream be down
<RaveBrony> Ive only been here for 10 minutes tho D:

<GilDash> Wrek: I'd just assumed you'd stopped. I was too busy elsewhere. :D
<TheRainbowDash> Who will be streaming next then?
<Michael> everyday i'm buffering
<Malavolent> Lil_B: As long as they don't translate pony names, it's quite okay.
<owlicious> I assumed it was just me
*Michael dances

<drf-Droid> real pros don't need bouncers
<XAX> Eh.
<Lil_B> Malavolent I'm just happy that they just didn't tranlated some Names, but I'm still pissed at some Translations of songs... I don't like Winter Wrap up, but it didn't hat to get butchered like this :/
<XAX> My throat is killing me, but other than that, I guess.
<MahBoi777> ouch
<Malavolent> Lil_B: It's pretty hard to translate it right, though. I'm afraid of our translation of song, but we usually translate foreign songs pretty well.
<Stormy> IT support for now
<Wrek> 05sorting the problem
<Malavolent> Lil_B: For example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6I9LkXS4uQ

<CCCP> :(
<Bronysith> AHHH deja vu how i hate u
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith: I know that feel
<TheRainbowDash> Wow, this is an experience.
<Stormy> I'm a CS major; it's not like I know nothing about computers and IT
<Malavolent> My stream still doesn't work.
<Stormy> It just takes a while to get used to this particular system
<Thorn> What is this, a Deadmou5 concert? Theres lazers all over the fuckin place.
<cachi01> Malavolent: hit the magic refresh buttton
<MahBoi777> ALL the colors @_@
<Wrek> 05this is 1994
<cachi01> Thorn: way better. a pink floyd concert
<Malavolent> cachi01: That was the first thing I've done :|
<Wrek> 05deadmasu was probably still in diapers
<Kimori> ahh
<Stormy> like I don't know everything about how the school's software works, stuff like that
<cachi01> Malavolent: lol click play
<Kimori> I originally wantd to be a CS major
<Stormy> it's an on-campus summer job
<Midnight_Tempest> deadmou5? seriously?... that just saddens me that people dont recognize pink floyd...
<Stormy> there's not really an application process
<Malavolent> Ok, refreshing helped.
<Skylands> 10Yes
<Om> panda: Don't steal my lazer bit ite
<Skylands> 10Scan through them
<cachi01> Midnight_Tempest: ikr :(
<Kimori> I ended up changing cause there was just nothing where I live for computer job seekers
<Skylands> 10Read offline PMs
*GilDash slaps Om.
<Thorn> Its a joke.
<Stormy> oh, really?
<Lil_B> Malavolent I'm really waiting for the dub of season 2, The writing and acting is better then in Season 1 and I'm really interested if they can keep the quality
<Malavolent> Wrek: You like Pink Floyd?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Inb4 I'm the Seapony of heavy lifting
*Om regrests nothing
<Thorn> Deadmou5 uses a lot of lazers.
<Stormy> where do you live, if you don't mind me asking?
<MahBoi777> lol
<Michael> Pink Floyd FTW
<Thorn> Thats why I said it.
<Wrek> 05the only and I mean ONLY good part of the swedish dub of S1 was soarins appel pie
<Stormy> CS is needed pretty much everywhere I thought
*OmegaMetroidBrony waits for the lift command
<Wrek> 05the rest is utter shit
<cachi01> people now a day see a kiss concert and they thnk its freaking lady gaga
<Yukari> that's obsessive lol
<MahBoi777> the audience must have sunglasses
<Litwick> And Spitfire.
<Icy> Hellooo !! Bronystatee !!! long time no seen !! ^.^
<WallDives> cachi01: dont make me cry.
<XAX> Wrek: Saw that on YouTube :D
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Well I've got exactly 1 week until the release of Czech dub.
<Midnight_Tempest> great... my eye is beginning to become blurry again... fffffffuuuuuuuuu
<Michael> hai Icy
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Icy
<WallDives> hi Icy.
<GilDash> Wrek: I do not need to be reminded of stupid sexy Swedish Spitfire. >_<
<crazypony> hi Icy
<MahBoi777> hey Icy!
<Lil_B> hi Icy
<cachi01> hi Icy!
<Thorn> For the B movie, can it be toy storryyyy? :3
<DuskStarshimmer> Midnight_Tempest, go to bed, and make sure the air in your room is hydrated
<DuskStarshimmer> also drink water
<GilDash> Thorn: No way. Toy Story is an A movie.
<Wrek> 05and actually contains oxygen
<Midnight_Tempest> DuskStarshimmer: i woke up a couple hours ago...
<Thorn> aww.
<cachi01> toy story is a freaking super mega duper A movie
<DuskStarshimmer> Midnight_Tempest, then its probably dry air
<GilDash> cachi01: Exactly. :)
<DuskStarshimmer> or general sleep deprivation
<Thorn> Well, how about the biggest tea party
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Oh, a correction, they will air Czech episodes starting on 11th July. They plan to translate Pound puppies too. But god, they've written My Little Ponny.
<Kimori> I live in California
<Midnight_Tempest> DuskStarshimmer: maybe... but why is only one doing it and not the other... that makes no sense
<Wrek> 05this ligthshow<33333333333
<Thorn> THAT would be a b movie.
<cachi01> i think thats a B movie Thorn
<MahBoi777> must be seen from spaaaaace
<Kimori> When I was trying to find work I was told that if I wanted to continue with my major I would have to relocate to find work
<DuskStarshimmer> Midnight_Tempest, *shurgs*
<Thorn> WHISTLRS
<Om> Lookat all dem lazers!
<Espeon> I don't even let it log anything because I wouldn't read it anyway
<Thorn> *whistles while moving head*
<Espeon> aka lazy 5ever
<Stormy> So what are you doing now instead?
<Skylands> 10No. I like to know what was going on while I was away.
*Michael applauds
<Lil_B> Malavolent I'm also interrested in the choices they will make for the voices... Discord for example... The guy who voiced Q in Star Treck was a brilliand fit, his voice was freaking amazing for this kind of stuff and very fitting for Discord, but he died 3 yeahrs ago
<the_guy_on_the_left> cant see s##t
<MahBoi777> so beautiful
<Thorn> Annoying, aint it? *whisles*
<Kimori> so I was looking for an alternative, found out they are building a prison in my city and they will be hiring a bunch of medical professionals
<GilDash> Lil_B: No, John De Lancie is very much alive and well. :D
<cachi01> im planning on getting a rozio game capture card is it worth it?
<Yukari> lol
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Germans surely have someone, who has Discord like voice :)
<Thorn> DISCORD IN A RED SHIRT.
<Kimori> That probably sounds bad but its a prison/mental facility
<Thorn> I CAN JUST FUCKING PICTURE IT.
<Thorn> X3
<MahBoi777> heh
<Lil_B> GilDash I was speaking about the german Voiceactor for Q XD
<Biglaw> Hey everypony! I'm back!

<XAX> Love my Internet
<cachi01> it was freaking amazing

<Michael> amazing pic
<MahBoi777> whoa awesome pic
<the_guy_on_the_left> i want a red shirt with discord in a red shirt
<Wrek> 05horrible quality

<Biglaw> Thorn NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
<RaveBrony> <3
<WallDives> Thorn: dont make demands.
<cachi01> PFFT Thorn first u will have metal then u will have ponies
<Kimori> After my last class in the summer ill qualify to submit an application to be an intern
<Stormy> Before I entered college everyone told me I'd have plenty of time to decide on a major and if I wanted to change it 25 times it would be no problem
<Thorn> And then STAH FOX.
<Biglaw> catchy tune
<RaveBrony> Thorn: Careful what u wish for
<MahBoi777> indeed
<WallDives> cause you might get what you ask for, not what you want.
<Kimori> and how many times did you change?
<Stormy> I don't see why because that is totally not true =/
<Thorn> With discord as peppy.
<TheRainbowDash> Wrek: Woah, how long have you been working on this piece of art so far?
<Thorn> :D
<cachi01> ^
<Stormy> never
<Skylands> 10Totally
<Wrek> 05so far..
<Wrek> 05looking to 18 hours
<Biglaw> wow
<Stormy> unless you can count originally being "undecided"
<TheRainbowDash> Wow, 18 hours? Geez man....
<Thorn> DO A BARREL ROLL.
<alexxm> thats a lot of work
<Kimori> I could see them saying you could change but all it does is set you back another year/2 years
<Kimori> nah
<MahBoi777> press Z or R twice!
*cachi01 eats a burrito supreme and a chicken supreme in a car thats supreme
<RaveBrony> Mfw Wrek can complete a masterpiece in the time it takes me to draw a decent eye >.> rofl
<Kimori> I was undecided when I first went into college
*Michael does a barrel roll
<panda> How the hell did you do that Wrek :D dat tail is awesome
<TheRainbowDash> Wrek: Well, 18 hours well spent. It looks astounding.:)
<Thorn> BAAARRREEEELLLL ROOOLL

<Malavolent> MLP FiM dubbing hall of shame: http://youtu.be/lz6uYZV5tYY
<Biglaw> Thron are you playing star fox?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ....
<Thorn> nnope.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Starfox... I played that on the SNES <3
<Stormy> One of my friends was a chemistry major for two years and decided he didn't like it
<RaveBrony> I need to learn how to do that shine thing he does.... well, first i need the program he uses :D
<WallDives> love Starfox.
<Stormy> So he switched to CS
<Bronysith> hey Biglaw
<Wrek> 05time i could have spent making sure i graduate
*Gunthler likes watching
<Wrek> 05but fuck it, drawing ponies :P
<Biglaw> Hey Bronysith, hows it going?
<MahBoi777> LOL
<panda> Wrek: :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Wrek /)
*Gunthler likes watching Wrek draw :3
<Bronysith> Wrek: disreguard education post ponies
<Bronysith> Wrek: /)
<Malavolent> Wrek: Draw ponies, sell ponies, profit.
<Yukari> dunno
<Stormy> he's going to graduate with my class because the professors gave him special permission to take classes before he had the prerequisites for them
<Kimori> I'm sure hed have an easier time finding work as a chem major
<MahBoi777> haters gonna hate
<Yukari> I don't quite understand the point of that
<Biglaw> Wrek who knows, you could make money selling prints on dA
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Then Hasbor takes your ass down Malavolent
<Thorn> BECOME A PONY
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *Hasbro
<Biglaw> Hasbor!
<Stormy> I don't think so; like I said, CS is needed everywhere
<Biglaw> yay
<Malavolent> Draw Hasbro, sell Hasbro, go to jail.
<MahBoi777> Lol Hasbor
<Michael> wtf
<Yukari> if it's important, you'll hear about it later
<Stormy> pretty much every company has at least a small IT department
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hasbor the mortal enemy of Sumerpan
<flutter_spin> http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/05/24/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ponify-all-the-cards/ make it happen :P
<Yukari> if it's just talk, it's not like you can join the conversation
<Stormy> and if you absolutely can't find work for someone, you can work for yourself as a freelancer
<MahBoi777> OmegaMetroidBrony: LOL:D
<Stormy> that's probably what I'm going to do
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :3
<Yukari> I dunno, I just dont get leaving a computer on just for that
<WallDives> flutter_spin: they still lose to flashhulk.
<Thorn> Meanwhile, I turned off the video volume.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek http://i.qkme.me/36f4am.jpg

<Irish_Pony> Wait what....
<ZappyTheUnicorn> RaveBrony: :D
<Lil_B> I would like to get someone to see it, but I'm not forcing anybody, plus this really isn't a "thing" various people know about, nobody here has ever heard about MLP (other then the Toys)
<Yokupony> Dis music :D
<Memme> NEVER watch dubs to other languages.
<Memme> It will make you puke.
<Tefacehuggah> ok

<Wrek> 05italian intro is the exception that makes the rule
<cachi01> Memme: im mexican and the mexican dub is pretty good check it out :)
<Blowdown> swedish spitfire, too
<MahBoi777> oh myyyyyy

<Tefacehuggah> SWEDEN!
<Memme> I don't like the Swedish one.
<Memme> But I haven't watched them all.
<Wrek> 05note that he said spitfire Memme
<Memme> Yea, I haven't heard it.
<Blowdown> I'm actually amused by any language I do not speak, so I'm biased
<cachi01> i can somewhat understand the italian intro
<Michael> gotta go dinner
<MahBoi777> DINNER
<GilDash> Agghh! I don't need to hear about Swedish Spitfire!
<Memme> Michael: Bye.

<cachi01> Blowdown: yep its in sethisto's channel
<MahBoi777> lol Memme
<Lil_B> well,the german version had also no accent for anyone, but when you just don't have such a "country" Style of accent in you country, then there is no point in emulating it, it will just confuse the kids
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: you must make things so detailed dont you :P
<Blowdown> sadly though, the dutch have a country accent
<Airpuff> Evening everypony
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: It's all in the details. :)

<Michael> http://derpy.me/ for short links
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No sarcasm was intended to be in that sentence
<Kabaka> We're okay with users talking about it, but if it gets too crazy or we start hearing complaints or anything questionable, we'll start paying more attention to the channel. That said, the premise is probably okay.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Not one syrupy drop of it.

<PartyCannon> LordCelestia :O
<BlueFlare> 02ah
<Kabaka> Not really. Just abide by the TOS and be mindful of the fact that we do permit users 13 and older to use the network (presumably with adult supervision if that young). Like I said, if things do get out of hand, we may ask you to hide the channel (+s) or close it entirely. It's a controversial topic. But we are not fans of censorship.
<Michael> hai LordCelestia
<owlicious> okay, don't tell us, I can't be trusted
<robotdragon8> k ur majesty
<owlicious> trust me
<BlueFlare> 02I thought that was the better one

<TheRainbowDash> Hello Shizuka! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
<cachi01> guys did you know that uring the early 1990s, Nintendo employees were obliged to let doctors remove the Sonic Hedgehog gene (yeah there is a gene called sonic hedgehog) from chromosome 7 with chemical therapy. As consequence, many employee offsprings were born with green pigment and outsize tongue.
<Kimori> oh you wont believe the stuff Ive got then
<Shizuka> 13busy
<Michael> hai Shizuka
<Blowdown> Dora the explorer is more retarded than derpy >.>

<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/google-infringing-link-removal/
<TheRainbowDash> Shizuka: Change your name to Shizubusy then.
<robotdragon8> interesting
<HyperMetalLugia> we could try using Yahoo?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Stormy> I never played Red/Blue/Yellow or Gold/Silver/Crystal enough to get into them
<Shizuka> 13nevar

<Gunthler> ffff
<Dark_Horst> ...so there was this guy who liked his girl very much. but he wanted to do something special for his proposal. so he forged her a ring. from a meteorite http://izismile.com/2012/05/15/home_made_wedding_ring_forged_out_of_a_meteorite_45_pics.html
<TheRainbowDash> Why not Shizui?

<Orger> why yes hello Kabaka
<Orger> I'm back :3
<SayWhat> Michael: D'awww
<Kabaka> Hi
<Orger> another question crossed my mind
<SayWhat> Michael: Pinkie s fluffee
<Orger> scenario:
<Blowdown> Kipkat07_Mare: hrm, general issue then is that your file is corrupted, remove and reinstall
<Orger> >person A has done drug X
<Orger> >is willing to try it again
<GilDash> Wrek: She's beautiful. A really good job, mate. :)
<Michael> IKR
<Orger> is it ok to recommend them an activity?
<Michael> brb
<Kimori> Spyro Orange gba
<alexxm> great job Wrek
<Wrek> 05http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Rarity-304145275
<Night_Dragon> thats it lol
<Meanwhile> Dat awesomeness.
<owlicious> WE'RE FREE
<Kimori> and they made the same game and bundled it with another
<GilDash> Wrek: Id you don't mind my asking, how long did it take for you to reach that level of skill?
<Litwick> Byootifull!
<klaxa> i think discussion about drugs is prohibited by ToS... right?
<SparklyWaffles> SO BEAUTIFUL
<FlareChaser|Octavia> ha! first to comment!
<owlicious> awesome... oh, the back rounds
<Orger> I got clearance for limited discussion =]
<Kabaka> Not explicitly
<FlareChaser|Octavia> I mean, not that...its good that I commented first...
<Wrek> 0512 years of drawing, 1 year of drawing ponies
<Blowdown> I feel really bad for saying it, but I really don't like it much :|
<Orger> the channel topic is: Everything drug-related | NO selling/buying, it will result in a ban | Don't encourage people to use a certain drug (e.g. "this shit is nice, you should have some")
<Wrek> 05thats right
<Orger> excuse me for the language in the last part :3
<klaxa> >You may not promote information that you know is false or misleading or promotes illegal activities or conduct that is defamatory or libelous.
<GilDash> Wrek: Huh, I wouldn't be getting there any time soon then. :D Still, a really good job, Wrek. :)
<Kabaka> Encouraging illegal activity is not allowed. Just stick to that.
<Wrek> 05my 1 year bronydom anniversary is in 3weeks...
<Wrek> 05:3
<LadyCanary> :D
<GilDash> I've already had mine back in Feb.
*alexxm hugs GilDash
<klaxa> yeah, that would be the easiest thing to do
<Michael> back again
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ok Wrek do you want us to get you a cake with a surprise in the middle?
*GilDash hugs alexxm.
<alexxm> mines some time in august
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Self Improvement!
<Blowdown> I've only been a brony since... midway season 2
<Orger> so it's not ok to recommend them to do X while on a certain drug, while they're willing to try it again without having that information prior to their decision?
<Wrek> 05right now i want a painkiller and some music before i go to bed
<cachi01> mine is till march next year lol
<TheRainbowDash> Oh my god, that background..:)
<LadyCanary> Go to sleep Wreky <3
<Meanwhile> Winter Wrap Up was the most recent episode when I got into the show.
<Om> Ah, you finished it while I wasn't looking.
<TheRainbowDash> Ah, see you later then Wrek. (waves and hugs)
<klaxa> aren't you acting against your own rule there?
<Wrek> 05not yet
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Wreky, its bed time for you.
<Kid_Cobalt> Wrek: Thats quite the accomplishment. And superb drawing as always sir.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I became a brony the week after Secret to my Excess
<FlareChaser|Octavia> I'm going to try League of Legends one more time >.<
<alexxm> i became a brony sometime in august
*Michael saves the Wrek picture :D
<FlareChaser|Octavia> hey look guys.
<FlareChaser|Octavia> me
<Orger> for now, I see it as being "don't tell people who've never used drug X before to use drug X"
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I found it weird at first... first ep watched being sweet and elite
<FlareChaser|Octavia> D:
<Blowdown> FlareChaser|Octavia: are you any good at it?
<crazypony> i became a brony after Lesson Zero
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Blowdown: I dunno.
<Blowdown> do you.. have an elo?:D
<FlareChaser|Octavia> wat
<klaxa> encouraging to take a drug at all is encouraging illegal activies, i think
<cachi01> FLARE REMINDED ME OF ANOTHER FUN FACT the league of legends champion is called varus and he is an archer. varus is also the name of a deformity in the knee!!! COINCIDENCE?
<Blowdown> that's like a skill level in ranked games
