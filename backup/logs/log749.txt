<Kewln00b> Resident Evil is almost a PG-13 series
<Zamer> http://fearlesspie.deviantart.com/art/Pie-336794424 Help Soarin get pie
<AlienWarhead> Doctor: pick him/her up, toss out of room, lock door
<Kewln00b> This movie is pure unrated.
<Ponies47> O.O
<Innate> Goriest movie: A inconvienient truth
<DocSane> I don't even want to think about what a My Little Dashie movie will be like.
<OohShiny> SkunkTari: Resident evil isn't gorish.
<Twinkleshine> ha
<OohShiny> SkunkTari: DeadSpace, on the other way

<DocSane> It's going to be sooo sincere and likely nigh unwatchable.
<EnoughAsh2> Zack: why yes it do- *collapse*
<CriticKitten> Resident Evil is pretty tame by comparison to real gore flicks
<PepperGirl> :(

<Kewln00b> Resident Evil doesn't even show people getting eaten.
<OohShiny> I just ate Ice Cream
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Santa! ^3^
<Record_Discord> RE6 looks like something giving something to somebody else.

<OohShiny> we must go buffer
<Jageman> back
<Meanwhile> The planet where self deprecation doesn't win sympathy votes like it used to.
<CriticKitten> Dark92Enigma: But that's not because it's not a gore film, that's because it's a festering pile of action movie cliche
<Kewln00b> Give the film a chance OohShiny, it's gory but it's also fucking cheesy
<SpikeIsThe7thElement> anyone up for talking about the next ep of mlp?????

<AttackWithHugs> I remember the first time I acutally fell out my chair laughing from a stream
<Yahooz> Back in my day dairy queen used to Put the Steviest of Magnets into the chat
<Nyra> After recently liscensing, owning, and operating a small film productions company, I have decided to provide the Brony community with the one thing it is surely missing. After being given the go ahead from Hasbro, which was horrible to try and complete, I have begun to look for a production crew for the first ever Fan-Made Full-Length Feature Film. Once again, I realize this is an odd request, and you might not see this notice a
<SpirittHooves> gore o.o
