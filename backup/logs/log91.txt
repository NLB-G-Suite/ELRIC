<prince-dari> :>
<R2-D2> 10nor link to them without like a different hostname
<AndroUser2> Yeah I'm not sure why.
<prince-dari> I don't need a different hostname.
<R2-D2> 10cause if someone links to a place with confirmed rule 34 while knowing it, the mods will get suspicious

<Umbreon> 12hmm

<SilverMane> it has a high evasion rate apparently; you can see that in it's stas
<Bluewing> 2I have a pound sign there.. xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Faaaaiill
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly keyboards
<HyperMetalLugia> Just copy and paste it off of the internet
<EdwardNewgate> pffffft. stats are for pussies
<Bluewing> 2Yeah I'll have to
<Bluewing> 2I know there's a button combination for it though..
<HyperMetalLugia> What kind of keyboard do you have anyway?
<SilverMane> i think there is a valuable weapon or armor left to find, besides that sword
<SilverMane> it's been a while, so i forget
<Bluewing> 2Oops I just joined channel
<SilverMane> ... yeahhh
<Bluewing> 2I still fail after all these years
<SilverMane> Manaberries used to have a different description before Chapter 3 caused major updates to all 3 parts; It used to be 2 berries, and it said "eating these highly suggestive berries will... etc."
<Zemy> That's one thing that will never change~
*TerrorBite` snuggles against LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<SilverMane> Chapter 21? OH MAH GAWD
<EdwardNewgate> Once you're like a Demi-God or whatever, do you get the attack Mollywhop?
<Bluewing> 2Shhhh you
<SilverMane> ... sure, why not
<EdwardNewgate> Cause that would be awesome
<SilverMane> Antipodes is apparently on par with Past Sins (neither of which i've read)
<Umbreon> 12hmm
<SilverMane> also, the author comes on here quite often
<EdwardNewgate> It's not hard to be on par with Past Sins
<SilverMane> he even hung out last Friday
<Bluewing> 2hmm
<EdwardNewgate> Not that I'm dissing the author of Antipodes
<SilverMane> EdwardNewgate, ouch
<EdwardNewgate> Just saying. and Dari, WWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<EdwardNewgate> No fanfics, AT ALL?
<EdwardNewgate> EVER?
<SilverMane> of course, i don't have opinion of it yet; I just know i'm going to go fangasm over Nyx if she is as they say
<SilverMane> She'll have to beat little Midnight first though; that filly has my OC heart
<Kosoveon> !umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to Kosoveon for 10 minutes
<Bluewing> 2xD
<Umbreon> 12nooo

<Bluewing> 2Good ol commands 8D
<SilverMane> Cupcakes, so sweet and tasy, Cupcakes, don't be too hasty
<EdwardNewgate> Pffft. No one can beat Little Pip in my heart
<Bluewing> 2I remember how we used to abuse Darkness's ones
<EdwardNewgate> But Silvermare is a close second
<Dashite> ^
<Dashite> Dammit!
*Bluewing 2runs
<SilverMane> >.>
<SilverMane> <.<
<Dashite> The one above that!
<SilverMane> I'm okay with this
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<SilverMane> Rainbow Dash is... honestly, kinda last place
<drf|laptop> 03Yeah, well, script abuse isn't funny :|
<Bluewing> 2Nope
<EdwardNewgate> Absolutely not, Pip is SO much better
<Dashite> ...
<SilverMane> but i totally got shipped to taht
<Bluewing> 2But we were silly/daft people back then D8
<drf|laptop> 03yep
<SilverMane> i'm sorry, but she was my canonical first ship
<Bluewing> 2Don't worry I don't plan on doing so anymore xD
<Bluewing> 2But do any of Darkness's ones still work?
<EdwardNewgate> Durrgan, OH YOU
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, make sure you go back through to see if you have ALL chests
<FreezeFrame> I really can't pick an OTP
<FreezeFrame> One of my RL friends who is a brony has fluttermac
<Insane_Lugia> whats everybody doing?
*R2-D2 10is back
<EdwardNewgate> I can, for whatever reason AppleDash is my OTP
<SilverMane> My somehow-favorite ship is TrixShy
<Bluewing> 2Playing HeartGold and catching up with old friends
<SilverMane> and Fluttermac is a very popular straight ship
<FreezeFrame> I prefer Rarijack, but I have no problem accepting Appledash
<SilverMane> some famous titles use it
<prince-dari> Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash x Dash
<prince-dari> Best ship. ^
<Bluewing> 2Hi
<Kosoveon> heya J!
<SilverMane> Rarijack was my first ship ever
<FreezeFrame> So clearly, Rarijack isn't an OTP
<Dashite> Strait shipping was best ship
<Insane_Lugia> hello there. welcome :)
<SilverMane> what is OTP
<EdwardNewgate> Isn't there a clopfic about DashXDash clones?
<FreezeFrame> One True Pair
<J-Lugia> heya!
<SilverMane> ... probably, Edward
<SilverMane> thanks Freeze
<FreezeFrame> There's a clopfic and a non-clopfic. That aren't related
<EdwardNewgate> You know what, there is. It's on my computer
<Bluewing> 2Say... is 'meep' still a common phrase here?
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Sadly :P
<SilverMane> Poison: Deals 5% of max health every round
<drf|laptop> 03xD
<Insane_Lugia> i say it
<EdwardNewgate> ...not that I, read clopfics or anything
<Bluewing> 2Didn't think that would ever change xD
<SilverMane> we all do EdwardNewgate, don't worry. Except dari, he's... CLEAN
<FreezeFrame> SilverMane: I shall join dari in that category.
<SilverMane> just wait for Mardek to become OP WTF Roflsauce
<Dashite> Also, Twilight x Book is canon OTP http://i.imgur.com/Ifvrj.gif
<EdwardNewgate> Did you just say enema?
<SilverMane> oh yeah, so crazyi f you did that dari
<SilverMane> FAILSAR
<SilverMane> lawl, poison ftw
<SilverMane> check to see if you found all chests; then light thingy
<EdwardNewgate> Also, I really only like ships that make sense to me. For any fics I read
<FreezeFrame> Exactly, Edward
<SilverMane> same EdwardNewgate; i hate 'I just met you, and i Love you' shipping
<FreezeFrame> My biggest thing with shipping is if it's well done.
<SilverMane> Trixshy is my favorite, replacing Twixie, due to exactly ONE fanfic
<Umbreon> 12defrag taking ages
<EdwardNewgate> Like I like AppleDash because it makes sense the most
<Bluewing> 2D:
<SilverMane> and Twixie held that spot for almost my entier fanfic career
<drf|laptop> 03defrag always takes ages
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Umbreon> 12considering i just uninstalled steam and tf2
<EdwardNewgate> And?
<FreezeFrame> I like Rarijack because of the fact that those fanfics are few and far between, and they tend to develop the relationship really well.
<SilverMane> Rarijack makes sense too, but AppleDash seems more fan-approved
<drf|laptop> 03yay
<Sumica> Lo all
<drf|laptop> 03finally some sensibility
<SilverMane> FreezeFrame, Swayback Mountain much?
<HyperMetalLugia> Good!

<Kosoveon> because I'm such a nintendo geek
<Kosoveon> XD
<prince-dari> To hack stuff.
<MirthTinker> will the hacking affect friday night's livestream?
<SilverMane> i LOVE crying from stories; sadfics make me happier overall
<Umbreon> 12wedding ness day
<prince-dari> No.

<Kosoveon> ewww no
<Nittany_Tiger> 4chan is on the warpath lately.
<EdwardNewgate> It's like I'm wearing nothing at all
<MaxwellTheScribblenaut> Heloooooo
<SilverMane> (it was my fault. sorry, i said they were losers who couldn't hack shit)
<Ziltoid> Prince-dari cant emotion
<ReticentSmolder> well, I have a hard time seeing how people won't be concerned when they try to come here and get a redirect by dinkypage saying they were hacked
*Umbreon gives Kosoveon a memory foam bed
<Nittany_Tiger> Immature kids at war. Sad.
<Sumica> there life sucks making his better by comparsion perhaps?
<Bluewing> 2I need one of those...
*Kosoveon ^_^
<EdwardNewgate> I enjoy an occassional sad fic
<Kosoveon> sooooooft
*Kosoveon throws Umbreon onto one
*Umbreon more floofy
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, eeyup. i am extremely empathetic to emotions, so feeling other's sorrow makes me sad, but when i compare it to how i SHOULD be feeling, i realize it's not my pain, and i feel better about me and my life

*Kosoveon floofs Umbreon as a result
<Nittany_Tiger> Severe immaturity is why I don't go to chans. I've been reminded that today.
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<ReticentSmolder> @EdwardNewgate you'd enjoy Last Man Standing then, its a conversion bureau spinoff, but the best of the bunch
<Umbreon> 12Bluewing
<Umbreon> 12the one you aren't sleeping in
<SilverMane> probably why i listen to others problems so much
<MirthTinker> ooo, that one made me bawl my eyes out
<SilverMane> it hurts to see them in pain, but the helping feels good; as does the listening
<EdwardNewgate> Sounds good
<Bluewing> 2Yes..
<SilverMane> Conversion Bureau... i really need to read that one
<Ziltoid> dari just needs love
<ReticentSmolder> yeah...there are a lot of points in the story that hit you in the get
<Ziltoid> Man.
<Bluewing> 2All the beds I've had I wake up in pain D;
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly, I like a good sappy lovey-dovey fic
<EdwardNewgate> The problem is so few are done well
<ReticentSmolder> @SilverMane the main story was never finished, but it spawned several excellent spinoffs
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, read Simply Rarity and Circle of Friends; then tell me sadfics don't feel good afterwords
<Sumica> But you read them so well =p
<SilverMane> they're both shortish
<ReticentSmolder> Pony Psychology is also worth a look for sadfic fix
<Umbreon> 12that's why you don't sleep in a bed
<Umbreon> 12and they don't cause you harm anymore
<EdwardNewgate> So, write your own fic
<Umbreon> 12the floor does
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, if you want we can find you some AMAZING stuff; i'd pay money for some of these storeis
<Bluewing> 2owo
<Bluewing> 2Floors do too >w>

<Umbreon> 12to find darkness!
<Ziltoid> Give it a lick
<Bluewing> 2Me?
<SilverMane> Of Mare's and Magic's original ending was PERFECT, and it was a worthwhile read; i disliked the epilogues fix for the ending, but i was happy for it going that way
*Nittany_Tiger brohoofs ReticentSmolder
<ReticentSmolder> it tastes just like raisins
<Bluewing> 2Long vacations
<EdwardNewgate> Silvermane out of everything, what is your OTP?

<Bluewing> 2Ha we actually have those here now
<Ziltoid> With a brush of its mane?
<ReticentSmolder> so do I :D
<Razyn> I almost cried at the original ending of of Mares and Magic; glad it changed
<Sumica> Sure you have all read it already but I just started Past Sins.
<EdwardNewgate> It turns into a plane
<SilverMane> EdwardNewgate... my favorite atm is Trixshy, although that's only as long as Kindness's Reward keeps it's place of honor. It used to be twixie, but that's still toppish
<SilverMane> Razyn, it was how it should have ended
<Nittany_Tiger> Sumica: Just finished it.
<Bluewing> 2They actually managed to fit another plane into Jersey's airport without another falling off the end of the island
<EdwardNewgate> I meant outside of MLP
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, "finished" it.
<prince-dari> I don't get all the popular fics with Trixie.
<prince-dari> Trixie sucks.
<SilverMane> And that ending hurt but... it was perfect.
<Ziltoid> WHAT
<EdwardNewgate> Like mine is RonXShego from Kim Possible
<Barry> Hallo all
<SilverMane> Trixie on the SHOW sucked; in fanfic we explore her character and find reasons to love her
<EdwardNewgate> There are some damn good fics of it
<Ziltoid> hai barry
<SilverMane> hello Barry
<EdwardNewgate> ohai Barry
<prince-dari> Yeah, but I only consider canon stuff.
<Razyn> hello Baaaary
<Barry> Like of Two Minds?
<prince-dari> All the built up personality in fanfics I disregard.
<prince-dari> Which is why Luna sucks.
<Ziltoid> typy typy
<prince-dari> Because she has one line and no personality.
<prince-dari> :P
<Barry> There's very little canon personality right now
<SilverMane> if you only consider canon, then of course fanfic is useless
<Nick> heh
<Barry> Dari, that should change in Season 2
<EdwardNewgate> But that's what makes her character great. You can do pretty much anything with her
<Ziltoid> LOL SHAFT OF LIGHT
<Nick> well its nice to see you back ;)]
<SilverMane> Ziltoid already did
<Bluewing> 2Thanks :3
<EdwardNewgate> My shaft is made of light
<Barry> Personally, I'm hoping for an entire episode detailing her backstory, up to her transformation into Nightmare Moon
<Razyn> mfw when prankster Luna is canon
<Kosoveon> hi Nick
<Ziltoid> Cowhotrod
<Nittany_Tiger> It's only because you all have permanently-perverted minds.

<Kosoveon> DO NOT QUESTION IT
<SilverMane> but he gets THE most powerful weapon
<Bluewing> 2I shall not.
<Bluewing> 2Rawr
<SilverMane> Verhn, who uses the same weapon types, is OP as fuck most of the time
<SilverMane> He is why Mardek can use healing spell and warp
<Kosoveon> IT IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
<Kosoveon> >:3
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol zed.
<SilverMane> i think you get Shield, M Shield, and the cure spell in this chapter

<SilverMane> lawl
<Nittany_Tiger> He's powered by fart.
<Bluewing> 2>w>
<EdwardNewgate> Mardek is not impressed
<Nittany_Tiger> That's his propulsion mechanism.
<EdwardNewgate> But he's a bitch, so he doesn't matter
<Bluewing> 2It's fulfilled it's purpose so far.. xD
<EdwardNewgate> oh, that'll help
<Zemy> Then why would it stop? It should send you back to the beginning. XD
<EdwardNewgate> Zeus would give you lightning bolts
<Bluewing> 2If it does, this DS is going out the window

<Temeraki> Well I stalk this channel so I can do random stuff like !sneas and !pie and !cake though those last two don't word
*Sneas now belongs to Temeraki for 56 minutes
<EdwardNewgate> I'd have to ask him what it's about, I've never read it
<SilverMane> so what are we watching now?
<Temeraki> But now I have to go play nhl online
<prince-dari> Well I'm going to get something to eat.
<Temeraki> peace peeps <3
<prince-dari> So I thought I'd put something on in the mean time.
*Bluewing 2saves and turns off game

<EdwardNewgate> SO PRETTY
<prince-dari> What the fuck.
<Nittany_Tiger> I saw that on TV days ago.
<Nittany_Tiger> A few times.
<prince-dari> Why is there a little girl in that advert? This show isn't for them.
<Nittany_Tiger> Notice two things.
<FreezeFrame> :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hello, Mibbit-user.
<Nittany_Tiger> A. White Celestia.
<Razyn> I know right?
<Nittany_Tiger> B. ALL ponies are now princesses.
<Ziltoid> WAIT WHAT
<prince-dari> I swear the Celestia isn't proper white.
<prince-dari> Still pink tinted.
<Ziltoid> play it again wasnt here
<Dermathil> dari, the show version has pink edges
<Razyn> It's not as bad as that one commercial that claimed Celestia was the only princess
<Ziltoid> HHHHNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG
<Dermathil> how do you think they could include that in the toys?
<prince-dari> So?
<prince-dari> You can't see the pink edges much.
<Dermathil> you still can
<ReticentSmolder> they have the jewelry from EPISODE 1!
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah, but Hasbro obviously doesn't know anything about governments.
<prince-dari> You can't seem them at ALL there.
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<prince-dari> It should just be white.
<prince-dari> Not pink tint.
<prince-dari> It looks like shit still.
<prince-dari> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Pink Celestia = Sunburnt Celestia.
<Nittany_Tiger> My take on it.
<Dermathil> lool
<booggie> hey
<ReticentSmolder> she has a summer castle in the Caymans
<Umbreon> 12hi
<GGgala_> woops. internet derped

<junh1024-XD> the ceiling?
<Nittany_Tiger> Even sun goddesses can get burnt from lying under the natural fusion reactor under their control for too long.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's not fake.
<Razyn> Pretty sure it was real
<Nittany_Tiger> I saw it on Cartoon Network 3 times in one day.
<Ziltoid> Wtf am I looking at
<prince-dari> Stupid google.
<SilverMane> Cartoon Network? Advertising Ponies?
<prince-dari> Changing its format.

<Nittany_Tiger> There are a shitload of girl toy commercials all over the cartoon channels. MLP is going to pop up there eventually (like it did).
<SilverMane> ... i was making a joke about the show being too manly for children

<Dermathil> Silvermane, I already pointed that.

<Dakota> did a friend of mine come through here?

<SilverMane> meh, i had one; maybe it's slightly random due to the way it works
<Dakota> Hi, hannah!
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, I have digital, but I haven't checked for Hub because I rarely watch TV and don't watch many channels anyway.

<SilverMane> is your sound off, Dari?

<SilverMane> if you have any serious 'must know answers in guidebook quality' questions, you can refer to the site fighunter.com and go to the wikia section
<SilverMane> it's basically full of EVERYTHING about the game; bios, background, stats, locations, strategies, dialogue scripts, etc
<Razyn> Why are you talking to that Bloke?
<Sumica> zak looks like he has a peg leg.
<EdwardNewgate> Awwwwwww, he has no friends
<EdwardNewgate> I'll be his friend
<SilverMane> hire Zak
<GGgala_> bookcases. the most useless of all RPG paraphernalia
<Sumica> What is every one is this bare name Bloke?
<Sumica> er bar*
<Razyn> Look at all those Blokes
<SilverMane> Bookcases are awesomesauce. full of random knowledge; and bloke is a title, not a name
<Sumica> man these blokes are slohed
<Sumica> so raceist
<SilverMane> BLACK SNOOTY
<Razyn> What the fuck
<GGgala_> toldja they were useless!
<Razyn> You can't read bookcases
<Razyn> You read books
<GGgala_> ...or maybe it's a secret entrance to something then, if you can normally read them in this game.
<Sumica> zach has no mouth
<SilverMane> he probably missed that one. fighunter did the WHOLE game on his own, music and all
<Sumica> kick his ass
<Razyn> >Generic Gold coins. Leaning against the fourth wall?
<SilverMane> depends
<GGgala_> no, you have to haggle!
<SilverMane> it's good to get him early so that you can get him skills now
<SilverMane> alright. you get a 5th party member later, but max combat party size is 4
<SilverMane> so you may have to juggle a bit; try to balance skill progress between all 5.
<Razyn> good lord
<Sumica> I still say it looks like he has a peg leg.
<SilverMane> Zach is a non-magical warrior; he has various offensive skills and uses a powerful weapon
<SilverMane> he also can put himself into a rage
<EdwardNewgate> Of course it's because he's black
<Sumica> no raceist would be saying to put him in the back row
<Sumica> or I guess cause it's combat put him in front.
<Sumica> sprite?
<Razyn> Spirit
<Razyn> SPR=Spirit silly
<SilverMane> oh Prince-Dari, two things: Don't buy gear that don't give skills (Spr is Spirit)
<SilverMane> and Don't sell any monster loot, like drills or wings
<SilverMane> they are uber-useful in chapter 3
<Sumica> sprit is usealy like mana regen.
<Sumica> there are way tooo many people in that house.
<GGgala_> there's one woman in this house? where is she?
<GGgala_> oh that lady
<Razyn> Only woman and she's naked
<EdwardNewgate> Who needs clothes?
<Razyn> All these chaps.
<Sumica> if you say so lady
<EdwardNewgate> Wait, I just want to fuck you
<GGgala_> a dozen Chaps and a Girl.
*Razyn is laughing for real right now
<SilverMane> i LOVE this game so much
<SilverMane> i'd seriously pay money for this trilogy
<Sumica> this game is so random.
<Nittany_Tiger> And then they fucked?
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<SilverMane> FigHunter is a crazy man who made a 60-hour RPG (chapter 3 of this) on his own, music graphics and all
<GGgala_> is the trilogy complete, or is more coming out in the distant vague future?
<Sumica> so like Zun with less moe?
<Nittany_Tiger> YALORT backwards is TROLAY.
<EdwardNewgate> ROYALT
<SilverMane> GGgala_, the game is planned to ahve 8 chapters
<SilverMane> but he mentioned it might be less than that
<GGgala_> ah
<SilverMane> each chapter is its own game, and save files transfer between them
<Sumica> at this point i would not be supprised to have a person in that town great you Pinkie pie style.
<SilverMane> inb4 zombies invade necrophiliac ladies town
<GGgala_> seems like it might be done by 2021 at the current rate
<GGgala_> >chapter 2, 2007. chapter 3, 2010.
<SilverMane> lol, he's taking a break from Mardek
<Nittany_Tiger> ^
<Nittany_Tiger> He did.
*Armageddon derpface
<SilverMane> a large part of chapter 3's length was that he completely overhauled the combat system
<SilverMane> he redid graphics, updated both chapter 1 and 2, edited all items, altered all equipment systems, removed the #dx damage system, etc etc
<SilverMane> created almost 100 songs on his own for teh game as well
<Sumica> Was this translated poorly from another language?
<SilverMane> much of the game is written poorly on purpose, to recreate accents and moronic characters
<Sumica> I agree !
<SilverMane> you know how well it is written when you read the books and talk to the intelligent character
<SilverMane> 's
<ReticentSmolder> these names...
<EdwardNewgate> mfw wifetta
<Sumica> Husbert
<ReticentSmolder> these names warrant the creation of an evil me...
<SilverMane> He had dozens of names to come up with; can't be a gem each time
<Sumica> should have been Dautera
<SilverMane> also, return to talk to Elwyen whenever you can; she has a present for you at some point
<MaleficentSmolder> IT IS I! Maleficent
<EdwardNewgate> Her virginity?
<Sumica> It's a man baby
<EdwardNewgate> ohai Maleficent
<SilverMane> MFW
<MaleficentSmolder> all the fillies in the first 3 rows are now pregnant
<SilverMane> FOr fuck's sake, really? Enchanted reference?
<SilverMane> and how did i know you would make that sex joke

<Ziltoid> lawl
<SilverMane> you said 'Oh Matron'
<SilverMane> 'tis a reference
<GGgala_> ...that's a reference?
<ReticentSmolder> this reference is a reference to other references
<MaleficentSmolder> ^somewhere, a librarian just came
*Dermathil waves. "Gotta get some sleep."

<EdwardNewgate> SAY GOODNIGHT MALEFICENT YOU ASSHOLE
<MaleficentSmolder> what part of evil do you not understand?
<GGgala_> OH did we stream a trailer for Carry On, Nurse?
<EdwardNewgate> Just because you're evil doesn't mean you have to be an asshole
<MaleficentSmolder> ...yes
<EdwardNewgate> mfw carry on dick
<MaleficentSmolder> yes it does so
<EdwardNewgate> NUH-UH
<SilverMane> alrighty then. back to it
<MaleficentSmolder> inb4 sea men
<ReticentSmolder> sorry bout my brother...he's an ass
<Sumica> more then one bed?! it must be a inn
<SilverMane> like Elwyen
<EdwardNewgate> Yay, new comic
<GGgala_> I thought MaeficentSmolder was a chick >_>
<GGgala_> *MaleficentSmolder
<EdwardNewgate> That's awkward
<ReticentSmolder> Maleficent is my evil brother, part of the Smolder family
<EdwardNewgate> LE GASP
<MaleficentSmolder> evil is so subjective...I prefer to think of things as adhering to my standards or not adhering...just happens most everything is acceptable
<SilverMane> that was a self-reference
<GGgala_> who gave him a girl's name?
<Sumica> Twilight and trixie go camping.
<SilverMane> Psuedolonewolf is teh creator of the game
<SilverMane> Firequill is his wife
<EdwardNewgate> mfw Twilight's last line in the comic
<SilverMane> they ARE magic circles...
<SilverMane> because shut up
<Sumica> that was a great last line.
<EdwardNewgate> We make them fight to the death after they're zombies
<SilverMane> you go south
<Sumica> and yeah derpy trying to use heat vision is a scarry thought.
<EdwardNewgate> IT'S GOING IN TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
<EdwardNewgate> That guy in the tall grass looks like he's shitting
<SilverMane> just exit like you came in
<Sumica> " when they look at me they see a looser,well save for the guy with the lazy eye. he sees a looser and the vending machines"
<SilverMane> it was a conversation-map-point
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> lolhai
<EdwardNewgate> Sumica, Scary movie 3?
<SilverMane> mfw Warm Glowing Warming Glow. I LOVED that line. was that simpsons?
<Sumica> Family guy
<EdwardNewgate> Oh
<EdwardNewgate> Makes sense
<Sumica> is't beseark a bad thing normaly?
<EdwardNewgate> Have Emela and Durgan shagged yet?
<Sumica> it's supper efective
<SilverMane> Beserk increases his damage by about 50%, and since he doesn't do anything else yet, that's fine
<Sumica> ah, guess I have played too much FF.
<Sumica> Beserk tens to result in the party member kicking his own ass more often then not.
<Umbreon> 12NightSeas is a taco face
<GGgala_> no, FF Berserk makes you stronger too, doesn't it?
<Sumica> yes but you cant control what who the target is.
<SilverMane> Berserk is enemy-only
<SilverMane> confusion causes random target

<Sumica> it brings de magicz
<SilverMane> put it on someone who DOESN'T have any passive abilities
<EdwardNewgate> PROUD TO BE A BRONY
<SilverMane> the magic circle is simply a map point; no effects until Chpater 3
<Altair> and hi2uall
<SilverMane> skills matter more atm
<Sneas> 03Hi

<Razyn> 0"What the devil is this magic lamp...?
<Kosoveon> night all
<Razyn> 0Oshit boss battle out of fucking nowhere!"
<SilverMane> put it on Mardek asap, M Shield is a mardek-only skill
<EdwardNewgate> God, Mardek is so fucking USELESS
<SilverMane> take off snake stone
<SilverMane> give it to Zach, give mardek flower
<Sumica> remove what now?
<SilverMane> he already started on insomnia, let him keep it until mastered
<WWW> (Ello?$
<SilverMane> it's a cure spell; let mardek learn it later
<SilverMane> hello WWW
<EdwardNewgate> Why hello WWW
<WWW> (Hiya, Uhm... Should I switch my Nick to my OC?)
<EdwardNewgate> Can you change nicks right now?
<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, as soon as someone masters all skills on an item, give it to someone else who can learn it; mastering skills is first, gear quality is second in importance
<Armageddon> bbl

<EdwardNewgate> I mean, YALORT I WANT THAT GUYS SWORD
<SilverMane> the double-bladed pole arm?
<EdwardNewgate> yes
<SilverMane> M Shield reduced all magic damage (and healing) by half
<EdwardNewgate> oh, and there goes Ambet
<EdwardNewgate> Amber
<Nittany_Tiger> Tinychat?
<EdwardNewgate> He's gone
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder if you get trolled by flashers.
<Nittany_Tiger> Especially ones that thing their penis is so wonderful, that they have to show it to the world.
<EdwardNewgate> Wait, I DON'T have to show my penis to the world? PREPOSTEROUS
<Nittany_Tiger> Put up Justin Bieber gif image. Double your channel count.
<Nittany_Tiger> Seriously.
<Nittany_Tiger> We did that one time.

<SilverMane> Prince-Dari, passive (green diamond-ish shaped) skills gain AP at the rate of 1 per combat.
<EdwardNewgate> too late
<SilverMane> so it takes 40 battles to master insomnia and the like
<Nittany_Tiger> Too many idiots and penises on Tinychat.
<Nittany_Tiger> And kids that think saying "nigger" and "fag" are cool.
<EdwardNewgate> Looks a lot like Chat Roulette
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<SilverMane> Reaction skills gain AP via usage; every attack or defense that has a succesful reaction gives 1 ap to coresponding skills. Defending a melee attack gives 1 ap to all melee defense reactions, etc etc for magic
<Nittany_Tiger> Except you can chat with many more people on cam.
<EdwardNewgate> Also, DARI SAY SOMETHING I'M BORED
<Nittany_Tiger> And there are dedicated channels so you don't have to go on something randomly.

<SilverMane> 11th doctor is full of MY MIND HURTS NOW though, so he's funny
<EdwardNewgate> I do like him
<EdwardNewgate> But 5th doctor is my all time favorite
<SilverMane> not going to heal up Zach?

<EdwardNewgate> He's a terrible actor
<Razyn> 0I once heard the main character from crank was being considered for the 11th doctor. Thoughts, Prince-Dari?
<Insane_Lugia> good night all
<EdwardNewgate> God, you should see my face right now

<NightSeas> 12Awesome show
<NightSeas> 12The ending is a bit predictable though
<Umbreon> 12oh well aren't they all
<Umbreon> 12well most
*Light_Latias pets Umbreon
*Umbreon eeps
<NightSeas> 12The ending is a bit predictable though

<Umbreon> 12the cowboy bebop game certainly didn't end up in paradise :?
<Umbreon> 12even after seeing all the episodes you'd still not know what she's talking about

<Lakorv> I use a minimalistic libary for the network stuff, nick handling and triggers.. the rest's mine.
<Lakorv> and I just finished the first rough sketch of my userinfo database.
<Lakorv> now to syntax-check the code..

<Griggs> Indeed
<Ascendant> yea
<Ascendant> h
<Griggs> I mean everyone on the internet is a man
<Griggs> Anope should know that.
<Armageddon> XD
*Espeon|School now belongs to lighty for 14 minutes
<Espeon|School> Okay
<Ascendant> xD
<Espeon|School> even though it would be easier for me to add a few nicks and make it halt when I use those nicks, but THIS KEYBOARD AND NO MOUSE - I'LL WAIT UNTIL I GET HOME
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Espeon|School> and obviously this nick implies SUDDEN afk-ery. Not really today as it's still like preperation and such but oh well~~
<Ascendant> XXXXXXD
<Espeon|School> and it actually takes effort to ~ because the movement in my muscle memory leads to altgr + enter :<
<Espeon|School> now back to the scheduled show - ewwing at IE
<Ascendant> lmfao

<Drake> 04back
<Espeon|School> 06Drakes
<Drake> 04heya Xeli
<Espeon|School> 06besides the ping... my connection at home is faster o.o
<Darky> Its a schoo
<Darky> What did you expect
<Espeon|School> 06Well it used to be like
<Espeon|School> 06silly fast
<Espeon|School> 06dunno what happened
<Espeon|School> 06also what's with the ` Draelen has /yayquestions
<Drake> 04Lately I've been lagging alot.
<Drake> 04It's only on my browser and various online games though. mIRC has little lag.
<Espeon|School> 06Heh
<Drake> 04Thus I cannot play TF2 online. Sadface
<Drake> 04Although I did find an item while playing with bots, which was amusing.
<Darky> Which item?
<Drake> 04The Loch 'n Load Grenade Launcher
<Espeon|School> 06I'm curious too :3. And items can be found even with cheats activated so xD
<Espeon|School> 06Oh, that one is pretty fun but hard to use though
<Darky> Lol cheata
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Drake> 04I noticed
<Espeon|School> 06what I just like some slow-motion action with my bots ;-;
<Darky> Gotta go, bbl
<Drake> 04When it said 'shattered on impact' I thought it meant 'explode'
<Drake> 04Obviously not
<Espeon|School> 06.. not like that
<Drake> 04Cya Darky
<Espeon|School> 06And yeah, many thought that at first xD
<Espeon|School> 06and see ya ¨¨
<Espeon|School> 06~~*
<Drake> 04Still, bots are fun.
<Drake> 04Too bad you can't get achievements, although engineer achievements would be ridiculously easy to get.
<Espeon|School> 06Yes you can.
<Drake> 04THEY NEVER LEARN THAT THERE'S A LEVEL 3 SENTRY AROUND THE CORNER
<Espeon|School> 06But it requires console swag
<Drake> 04You can?
<Drake> 04oh
<Espeon|School> 06as in in-game console, not like an Xbox LOL
<Drake> 04I don't even know how to bring up the console lol
<Drake> 04obviously
<Espeon|School> 06if your ~ key is over your tab key
<Espeon|School> 06click that
<Espeon|School> 06if not (like me) it takes a bit more
<Drake> 04That's what I do on Spore. 'moremoney' pz
<Drake> 04Nah, it's there
<Drake> 04plz*
<Espeon|School> 06Then you just have to enable it in options (enable developer console) and click tilde
<Espeon|School> 06I think
<Espeon|School> 06I just enjoy doing it that way because I can add MOAR bots, mess up respawn timers and in general make things as super unserious as bot games should be
*Espeon|School dies
<Espeon|School> 06however, running tf2 on this computer would basically be assisted suicide
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I can run TF2 perfectly fine on moderate graphics (I think high graphics -the motion blur would be fine as well but I don't want to try), it's just I lag even when my internet is working 'properly'
<Drake> 04I average a ping around about 200
<Espeon|School> 06motion blur chomps down resources and makes you motion sick, also makes scout and other aim-heavy classes harder to play :P
<Espeon|School> 06And aww, you should try to go to the server list and sort by ping
<Espeon|School> 06I've played on some australian servers
<Espeon|School> 06(obviously lagging like a champ)
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Espeon|School> 06I run everything at low low low low even though I can run it on medium or high. But then again I am a member of FPSaholics anonymous soo
<Espeon|School> 06And I know I seem MORE talkative while at school but it's lunch now anyway so nothing weird there :3
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04That's fine
<Drake> 04I'm currently trying to find an IRC client for my Mac (LLOTS found one and I'm going to try it out tomorrow)
<Drake> 04So then I can talk (and waste classtime even more) with you guys at school :D
<Armageddon> heya MajinMew
<MajinMew> sup
<Espeon|School> 06:3
<Armageddon> :p
<Ascendant> Drake, I'll bet you that they have it firewalled
<Ascendant> aka portblocking
<Drake> 04Maybe
<Ascendant> and you can use colloquy
<Espeon|School> 06this nick can be considered "here but suddenly vanishing for 5min - many hours at a time"
<Ascendant> or run mIRC via WINE
<Ascendant> I'm not sure if xchat runs on macs but I assume so
<Drake> 04We all thought that my friend could get away with breaking through the filter, but not 2 hours afterward the IT guys called him up during class
<Ascendant> haha
<Drake> 04I was thinking about colloquy
<Drake> 04Still, we've gotten into the Admin accounts on our laptops before - easier to do something when the IT guys aren't watching out every move.
<Drake> 04Seriously, if you're connected to the Clarence internet, they can see everything you're doing on your computer until you disconnect
<Espeon|School> 06No matter what I'm sure your it guys are smarter than the ones here..
<Espeon|School> 06I mean they do their job and "smart" is probably wrong to say
<Ascendant> My guys are ;-;
<Espeon|School> 06they just trust us too much
<Ascendant> I /still/ haven't managed to get past the firewall/proxy
<Ascendant> after 4 years
<Espeon|School> 06I mean I can juggle irc and schoolstuff but at least they finally realized facebook should be blocked
<Espeon|School> 06not everyone has dat willpower

<Sathi> 7yea I believe so, but some vids are no long available..so i'm unsure..oh well we'll find out soon
<RobotPinkie> Though as long as they don't go after PMVs and such, I'm good, pretty much.

<Sathi> 7I did the same :)
<RobotPinkie> http://i.imgur.com/q77bD.jpg
<Ray> 02That gun is awesome

*Armageddon yawns

<Rodman> WINTER WRAP UP YES!
<RobotPinkie> I've only brushed Fluttershy's hair out, it was just... really bad to begin with
<Rodman> Hey Sathi, what program do you guys use to stream?
<Sathi> 7flash media encoder
<Rodman> Only mods can stream though, right?
<Sathi> 7yep
<Sathi> 7not even all the mods
<Sathi> 7you need to have a decent connection
<Rodman> Yeah, that I figure is a must
<RobotPinkie> Aw man, I'm torn between wanting to just run out right now and buy them, and wanting to stay home and clean up a bit.
<Sathi> 7my bf is cleaning the house :)
<Rodman> Do it in this order
<Rodman> >Clean shrine to ponies >Go buy ponies

<Rodman> Same issue here
<RobotPinkie> but yeah, I'm from Sweden, I was just really obsessive about learning English as a kid.
<RobotPinkie> Why wub Sweetie Belle in this song
<Rodman> On my end, always preferred speaking English instead of Spanish
<Rodman> Trivia: Apple Bloom's voice actress sings Sweetie Belle's song

<Espeon> 06... sounds oddly fair
<Pegacorn> Team America FTW
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04It's fun
<Rodman> I have mixed feelings towards it
<Rodman> On one side, I really liked the movie and the song was just lulztastic
<Rodman> On the other, I hate the US, so it was awkward at the time
<Pegacorn> I hate the US too,but the movie was a satire of the US's attempts to be the police of the world.
<Rodman> I know, thats why I really liked the movie
<Pegacorn> Cool.
<Pegacorn> So,who would like to see Team America in an upcomming Brony Movie Night?
<Rodman> I say AYE!
<Pegacorn> I would like that alot.
<Rodman> Though, whether it classifies as an A movie or B movie, I wouldn't know
<Sathi> 7team america you say?
<Sathi> 7a moment pls
<Pegacorn> Totally an A-Movie.
<Espeon> 06the new spy revolver sounds really fun if you play against oblivious engineers
<Sathi> 7is it with puppets?
<Rodman> Yes it is
<Pegacorn> Yes.
<Drake> 04Which one?

<Pegacorn> lol
<Rodman> Thats why it was funny RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I know
<Espeon> 06yes
<RobotPinkie> Best part is "so ronery," btw...
<Rodman> I for one though, would like to introduce my bronies to one of my favorite movies of all time
<Drake> 04XD
<RobotPinkie> or that's my favorite part, anyway
<Espeon> 06but then I read about the damage and they were clever enough to make the stored crits not strong enough to lolOneHit scouts
<Drake> 04*sap* *sap* *sap* CRITSHOT from a distance
<Rodman> The "Lord of the Rings" of China, basically
<Rodman> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/
<Drake> 04awww
<Espeon> 06Scouts really love getting one-shotted afterall. But yeah, crits have no damage falloff over range so it's like a sniper
<Pegacorn> Red Cliff?
<RobotPinkie> Ooooh, I want to watch that.
<Rodman> I've been one year in Taiwan, and I've got to say that is one of my all-time favorite movies ever now
<Pegacorn> My favorite movie of all time is Kick-Ass.My second favorite movie of all time is Scott Pilgrim vs The World.
<Drake> 04XD
<RobotPinkie> I'm so not hip, my favorite movies are Fitzcarraldo and Dead Poets Society...

<Ascendant> yay
<Rodman> My only issue with it being that after tier 3, the tanks get quite pricey both in money and exp requirements
<Rodman> So yeah, bit of grinding required, but otherwise quite solid
<Rodman> I recommend it
<Sathi> 7I played wow

<Dman> also yah, if i need to buy new ones that come with repeats, it's brony sharing time : D
<Dermathil> Dman, I wouldn't need to play awesome music.

<Dman> meow meow meow
<RobotPinkie> Yay! Thanks
<Dman> lul
<RobotPinkie> I might use that in a video one of these days....
<RobotPinkie> Like normal PMV, and suddenly.....
<Dman> hahaha
<Dman> ...i have a billion ideas for a trillion PMVs and can't decide on which one to sit down and do : /
<Dman> i've done a few shenanigans, and - i can lip sync perfectly :3. i just don't know which song to actually use, i have so many I like
<RobotPinkie> I only have one PMV I really desperately want to do, thankfully
<Dman> I also have ONE song i'm making - a sort of compilation / medley :D
<RobotPinkie> though I do have a pony related video I want to make....
<Dman> RobotPinkie - unless it's something you really want to do on yer own, want help?
<RobotPinkie> Maybe, though I'm too tired to work on it today
<Nick> *pokes Shadow_Lugia
<Dman> :(
<Dman> it's only 5pm here
<RobotPinkie> Kinda blown out from too much GIMP
<Dman> HEY did you make any more vectors and stuff?
<RobotPinkie> same here :P
<RobotPinkie> Not yet, no
<Dman> u have my timezone? <3
<RobotPinkie> Couldn't find a good pic to do
<Dman> ah well
<fry> anyone here play chess?
<RobotPinkie> Thankfully I'll have all weekend off with nothing to do, yay
<Dman> so ur too tired? : /
<Dman> ah ok. I just need an idea to do...I might start one of my planned pmvs nao...
<Dman> if i'm motivated to
<Dman> maybe
<RobotPinkie> Right now I'm kinda exhausted, it might get better after some more caffeine :P
<Dman> ah ok then
<Dman> ...screw it, i'm starting one of my PMVS now then
<RobotPinkie> It'd be fun to do another coop thing, though
<Dman> coop? YES!
<RobotPinkie> I'm pretty good at isolating animations and stuff like that
<Dman> btw skills: pretty much anything with videos. i mean it. anything. any effect. but i fail at imagest thou
<Dman> yay we should totally do something awesome then! <3
<RobotPinkie> That'd be great
<Dman> yay
<Dman> but not today? you're tired?
<RobotPinkie> Maybe a bit later, I'm not sure
<RobotPinkie> Right now I just need to relax a while and look at ponies :P
<Dman> okies
<Dman> mfw fluttershy and daisy on my desk !!!! : D : D
<Dman> still way too happy about getting those girly toys XD
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<Dman> and u have like 6!
<RobotPinkie> I've cleaned away everything but ponies and epic D&D game collection from my desk
<Dman> has anyone seen them / asked you bout them?
<RobotPinkie> lol several people have seen them, only one has asked
<Dman> what happened?
<RobotPinkie> It's the potential brony friend who asked a lot of questions about them :P
<Dman> ah
*Dermathil sneaks off for reals
<Dman> orly
<RobotPinkie> Other people have at most just looked at me like I'm crazy
<Dman> lul
<RobotPinkie> Which I'm fine with, really
<RobotPinkie> If I could, I'd get that giant Pinkie that was at comic con and have it in the middle of my living room. :P
<Dman> eyup!
<RobotPinkie> I mean I don't want people to yell at me and call me names, but as long as they keep it to themselves they can think what they like

<Dman> i guess
<Ziltoid> Oh making one?
<RobotPinkie> Well, your MW3 Inception trailer was awesome, so...
<Ziltoid> What are you trying to make?
<Dman> ah thanks robotpinkie, but if you don't mind me saying first that was a request from a friend, and secondly, it's kinda pathetic. timing and fadeouts only thing used there.
<Dman> but glad ya like it! just that i hope this PMV will be aLOT prettier
<Dman> ziltoid - it might not be to the liking of some bronies, cuz of weird song genre, but 'Libera Me From hell' from gurren lagann, an anime. to ponies. =]
<Ziltoid> Cool
<Barry> Hi

<RobotPinkie> Maybe ustream? I dunno
<Dman> i'm good, barry : )
<Dman> i guess i could try
<Dman> i'd love to try, actually =]
<RobotPinkie> I think you need to download some special program to reroute the desktop to the webcam stream somehow
<Dman> i wouldn't mind :P
<RainBroDash> manycam
<RobotPinkie> No idea how it works, really, but it doesn't seem all that hard
<RainBroDash> it's free and there's an option to remove watermarks
<EdwardNewgate> sudddenly rainbro
<Dman> ohai rainbrodash
<RainBroDash> it's good for a starter anyway. you can't get the desktop sound out, but you can still use your mic while using manycam as a 'desktop webcam'
<RobotPinkie> suddenly edward AND rainbro
<RobotPinkie> also ohai guys
<RainBroDash> I'm lurking :P
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, hot

<Ziltoid> they see me lurking they hatin
<R2-D2> internet derped
<R2-D2> back
<RobotPinkie> u jelly of my Pinkie and Twi toys?
<Ziltoid> Livestream allows you to stream for free doesnt it?
<RainBroDash> yeah, I use Justin.tv though
<RobotPinkie> is Justin.tv better than ustream?
<Ziltoid> Justin is annoying because of their adds
<RainBroDash> i know all the starcraft streamers who -were- using ustream moved to justin.tv a while ago
<RainBroDash> but meh
<EdwardNewgate> Also, does anyone want to piss Dari off?
<Ziltoid> yes
<Ziltoid> always
<RobotPinkie> What was wrong with ustream?
<Dman> i jelly
<RainBroDash> idk
<EdwardNewgate> If you win the movie, pick the movie "Womb". Matt Smith is the main actor
<RainBroDash> ^
<Ziltoid> lawl
<fry> no chess players? >.>
<Ziltoid> ...Is it a good movie?
<RobotPinkie> lol I kinda want to stream some lets plays in the future, that seems to be popular
<EdwardNewgate> No, it has Matt Smith
<EdwardNewgate> but pissing Dari off is enough for me
<RobotPinkie> Oh, so in other words it's FANTASTIC
<RainBroDash> but yeah anyway I'm going back to lurking. kinda in limbo between watching K-On! and playing guitar
<RobotPinkie> alright, rainbro, see you later

<Pegacorn> Anti-feminist?More like Pro-feminist!
<ReticentSmolder> uh-huh...and how are the controls working for you bro?
<Dashite> Controls are fine.
<Rodman> I don't mind the gameplay, I like it actually
<Rodman> Its what they did to Samus what I despise
<ReticentSmolder> @Pegacorn, so having Samus not turn on her fucking missles until her commander tells her to is empowering?
<RobotPinkie> How's that game ending bug working for you?
<Sumica> "you may feel a small prick in your ass"
<Dashite> RS, he wasn't saying that.
<ReticentSmolder> oh
<Pegacorn> I hate feminism.They think they're all sooooooo great,while they aren't!
<Dashite> He was saying you used the wrong phrase.
<Dman> Back
<Dman> Rodman wanted something?
<roxsnow25> welcome back Dman.
<Rodman> Yes, Dman
<Nittany_Tiger> Pegacorn: So do I.
<Dman> thanks roxsnow25
<RobotPinkie> inb4 breach
<Pegacorn> And ReticentSmolder,sorry,never played that goddamn game.
<Dman> what Rodman?
<Ziltoid> hey dman
<Rodman> Did anyone ever send the RD vid to EqD?
<ReticentSmolder> it doesn't portray women in a positive light, much less a female role model in video games
<Dman> Well, I didn't
<ReticentSmolder> sorry Pegacorn
<RobotPinkie> Metroid 3
<Nittany_Tiger> At least I hate Feminism that puts women above men.
<Purple`Prose> Why are we watching house?
<Dman> House still on1
<Dman> THanks Sathi :3
<Dashite> Because House is cool.
<ReticentSmolder> its like Zelda...the second you give Link a voice people will hate it
<Sathi> 7episode 3
<RobotPinkie> Seriously only metroid game that's awesome
<Rodman> Imma go do it then, since Dari and RP didn't either
<Dman> Of course, I'd recognise the quote anywhere ^_^
<Dashite> What?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dman> and besides, i left for 20 mins after ep1 so yea
<Dashite> RobotPinkie be trolling now.
<ReticentSmolder> @RobotPinkie behind 3 Prime was pretty fucking awesome
<Dman> ...Rodman u wat
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I am trollan :P
<Pegacorn> I hate:feminism,eco-tards,Twitards,hippies and douches.
<RobotPinkie> I wub Prime 1 and 2
<Purple`Prose> So, has anypony been watching the new Thundercats?
<Rodman> Send it to EqD. Unless you don't want me to
<Pegacorn> *feminists
<ReticentSmolder> you can have feminism and radical feminism, there's a difference
<RobotPinkie> Fusion wasn't bad either
<Dman> I konw rodman, and i honestly don't mind, but 0___0
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, I liked fusion
<Dashite> Fusion had the SA-X
<Dman> It IS 1/3 yours rodman my man
<Pegacorn> New Thundercats?DO NOT WANT.
<Dashite> HATE YOU SO MUCH~!
<ReticentSmolder> and the Fusion suit you could get into Prime :D
<Ziltoid> MLP is about feminism
<RobotPinkie> Other M though? Uhm....
<Dman> SA-X. the only thing I was scared of in GBA
<Purple`Prose> *footsteps*
<Dashite> Other M had the best Ridley boss fight in the series.
<Pegacorn> And i meant feminists that put women over men.
<Rodman> Those parts where you had to escape the SA-X?
<roxsnow25> the only had metroid prime and all I remember I was being scared of the phazon mines.
<ReticentSmolder> SA-X is probably one of the best Metroid villains created, I think she was the inspiration for Dark Samus
<RobotPinkie> MLP is about friendship
<Rodman> Was like "CRAPCRAPCRAPCRAPCRAP!"
<RobotPinkie> and magic
<Sumica> Only saw the first one Prose
<Nittany_Tiger> I actually have my suspicions that Lauren Faust is mildly feminist. Just mildly.
<Ziltoid> that too
<Pegacorn> BULLFREAKIN'HORSESHIT!
<Dman> eyup
<Dashite> Yeah, running away from the SA-X was pretty nervewracking the first time.
<ReticentSmolder> SA-X and Ridley are among the top tier of badass villain figures in gaming
<Nittany_Tiger> Not feminazi, but if you look, you'll notice it.
<RobotPinkie> Nothing wrong with feminism. Might be a misnomer, at worst.
<Purple`Prose> Epic Sax SA-X?
<Dashite> Running away on Hard mode was pretty bad too.
<Pegacorn> Offtopic,but does anypony else think that L4D Tanks are overpowered?
<Dman> lol
<ReticentSmolder> lol
<Dashite> Nope
<Rodman> Lauren Faust? Feminist? You're shitting me Nittany_Tiger
<ReticentSmolder> yes
<Dman> Pegacorn, u playing L4D2 much then?
<Dashite> L4D tanks are not overpowered.
<Rodman> Pegacorn, not that much
<Sathi> 7he died :(
<Dashite> Auto-shotty > Tank
<Pegacorn> I was playing it this morning.
<Dman> who died?
<ReticentSmolder> tank ai is overpowered in L4D2, player tanks can range from good to terribad
<Sathi> 7Pega
<Dman> ah
<Dman> lol
<Dman> well, at least he's playing the game :P
<ReticentSmolder> lol
<Pegacorn> I died about 5 times in the same goddamn level!
<Sathi> 7we should play more Dman
<Nittany_Tiger> Rodman: I didn't watch PPG because of it's negative portrayal of boys.
<Nittany_Tiger> It was directed by Faust.
<Pegacorn> I watched PPG.I thought t was good.
<Dashite> Tanks depend more on where the spawn than anything else.
<Nittany_Tiger> Though animated by Genndy Tartato..whoever.
<Pegacorn> But i hate most shows that portray boys as douchebag morons.
<Ziltoid> LAWL
<ReticentSmolder> hehe...just got zero mission
<Dman> Sathi, i wouldn't mind, but cuz still saving for new pc, as current one plays at like 5 to 10 frames per second, so i'd like to but maybe some other day
<ctr> I'm live now :3
<Dman> still, thanks for hte maps ^_^
<Rodman> Genndy Tartakovsky, Nittany_Tiger
<ReticentSmolder> @Nittany PPG did make boys the villains more often than not, but you have to remember it through guys a bone with the single dad shtick
<Rodman> Personally, I really liked the show
<ctr> if you want to listen, it's the same link as SilverSonic's show
<RobotPinkie> Yeah PPG was good.
<Nittany_Tiger> through guys a bone with the single dad shtick <- What?
<ReticentSmolder> the Professor was a good male role model in the show, balancing the incompetence of some of the other male characters (the mayor in particular)
<ReticentSmolder> I meant threw*
<Dman> stoopid mom
<Barry> Hallo
<roxsnow25> hello there Barry
<Sumica> I sense a fight.
<SilverSonic> http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u this would be that link :p
<Nittany_Tiger> Feminism is lessened in MLP, but you still have the fact that the first two male characters you see in MLP are Snips and Snails, and they're both morons.
<ReticentSmolder> wait, so zero mission is a remake of 3?
<Dman> lol true
<Dashite> What about Big Mac?
<Dman> and no reticentsmolder, it's a remake of 1
<Dman> with extended ending
<Rodman> No, Zero Mission is a remake of 1
<ReticentSmolder> oh
<ReticentSmolder> lol
<Dman> Ninjad xD
<Rodman> NINJA'D!
<Sumica> beat me to it Dash
<RobotPinkie> lol

<ReticentSmolder> but maybe that's just the morph ball room always looking like it does hehe
<Rodman> Thats because 1 and 3 take place in the same planet
<Dashite> lol
<Sumica> all the metroids look the same
<Dashite> illegal downloads.
<ReticentSmolder> though, the soundtrack (even for GBA sounds) is quite good
<Ziltoid> exept not

<drfsupercenter> 03as in, F*** YEAH SEAKING
<RobotPinkie> unfortunately no Dari to lolkick me :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but I chose Shellos instead as it's more rare
<Dman> reticentsmolder, yfw actually half of about 99% of drugs actually are useless due to the polarity of the compounds and the shape of cell receptors
<Dman> ^_^
<Dashite> Dashite = Doctor. :)
<Dashite> Score!
<Rodman> FREEMAN'S MIND EPISODE 38 IS UP!
<Angel_Espeon> 13But Shellos is a derpslug
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<Dman> oh lol
*RobotPinkie sits on the moon with Luna, a crate of bananas and some brushes.
<Sumica> sweet
<HyperMetalLugia> Shellos is good enough :o
<ReticentSmolder> I just got science'd :O

<Dashite> >Watch me
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the reason why

<Shadow_Lugia> 6How?
<Dashite> RS, which boss are you at?
<drfsupercenter> 03Hacking.
<drfsupercenter> 03well not really
<ReticentSmolder> first
<RobotPinkie> lolol Dman
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't call it hacking
<Dman> hearing in next room? is that the wormy?
<ReticentSmolder> the worm, tunnelly thing
<Shadow_Lugia> 6What is it, then? ovo
<drfsupercenter> 03it basically just sends a script to the site
<ReticentSmolder> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03that says "User completed the minigame"
<drfsupercenter> 03so instead of taking 90 seconds
<Dashite> Ah
<drfsupercenter> 03it takes like one
<Dashite> Him
<drfsupercenter> 03if that makes sense
<ReticentSmolder> EAT MISSILES IN YOUR EYE BEEEYETCH
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I see.
<drfsupercenter> 03but the other useful
<drfsupercenter> 03*thing
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Tell me if you get a female Wooper. :P
<Ziltoid> WHAT

<drfsupercenter> 03you know how you get 9 steps to find the island?
<ReticentSmolder> you guys never play metroid?
<Dman> 0___0
*RobotPinkie almost had a heart attack
<drfsupercenter> 03so at most you'd see 9 Pokémon per trip, right?
<Dman> WALL.E
<Wrek> "i told them WAAALEEE"
<drfsupercenter> 03well in reality there's about 20, each visit to the island
<Dashite> Huh? Who never played Metroid?
<roxsnow25> suprise wall.E
<drfsupercenter> 03they're just in random places.
<ReticentSmolder> that's pretty much how you kill each boss, lots of missiles to the face
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yep.
<Dman> whutwasdat wall.e
<drfsupercenter> 03This script finds and gets all 20. :)

<drfsupercenter> 03until like 3 days agto :)
<drfsupercenter> 03*ago
<RobotPinkie> lol now I can't hear what they're saying

<Dman> EdwardNewgate, have you seen the scene with the inhaler?
<EdwardNewgate> No
<Dman> it's hilarious basically, but oh well
<Dashite> No Lupus. It's never Lupus!

<drfsupercenter> 03since I don't want to actually give it away
<Sathi> 7no..dinkypage got cut off
<Shadow_Lugia> 6:D
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Thanks. :>
<drfsupercenter> 03I always find it weird how the Entralink calls it the Entree Forest
<Dman> i heard it was attacked by cyberterrorists : <
<drfsupercenter> 03are they serving my Pokémon for dinner now?
<bluesun> Entra>Entry>Entree
<Wrek> Dman, its heaven.
<Sathi> 7 Our old site is still down thanks to Hacktivist group "Anonymous Columbia"
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds disgusting :P
<EdwardNewgate> mfw I watched the inhaler vid
<ReticentSmolder> it was used to attack other sites by cyber terrorists
<Dman> ...Wrek, i like the dance at the end hahaha
<GabeMoist> Naw the cyberterrorists used Dinkypage to attack
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Entry + Tree = Entree. :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6</obvious>?
<roxsnow25> its a darn shame really.
<GabeMoist> then the cyberpolice were called
<bluesun> compared to Hairi(nk)>Hairi>Hairu(tree)
<roxsnow25> cyperpolice are pretty active man.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03Tree as in tree
<Asmalya> i justed wanted to say
<Asmalya> muh
<bluesun> yes, tree as in tree
<drfsupercenter> 03I was thinking Entree as in, the French word for meal o.o
<Asmalya> :>
<Insane_Lugia> hello there :)
<ReticentSmolder> more like Dinkypage's provider was called, er called them and told them they were suspended
<Dashite> Body piercings on bacteria.
<Dman> ok
*drfsupercenter sets his C-gear back to the basic skin
<bluesun> ;p
<GabeMoist> I like the cyberpolice idea better
<lightumbreon> 06or entree as in dutch for entrance
<bluesun> aw, skating Pikachu is bad?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's really distracting LOL
<roxsnow25> how bout them cyber detectives!
<ReticentSmolder> Samus, y u no space jump boots?
<RobotPinkie> so much pony on my table right now... SO MUCH OMFG
<GabeMoist> no pony on mah table
<Dashite> Because Samus is pony http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/288/e/3/samus_pony_iid_by_techneurology-d30id3b.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna need to reboot to get my NDS Adaptor Plus or w/e it is to work
<Dman> ROBOTPINKIE I WANT UR DESK....soon....
<ReticentSmolder> TEH WINNING
*RobotPinkie 's head explodes
<Dman> epic pic dashite
<ReticentSmolder> saved
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm, DRF:
<Sumica> nice custom.
<Dashite> There were more. http://techneurology.deviantart.com/gallery/
<Dman> found this too http://th05.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2011/119/e/e/samus_zero_suit_pony_by_kyrospawn-d3f5pqi.png
<RobotPinkie> Wow
<drfsupercenter> 03?
<ReticentSmolder> wouldn't it be hard to walk on 3 legs and fire with the fourth?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Would it be possible to 'hack' to send multiple pokemon from the Dream World to your game?
<Dman> that's awesome Dashite
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
*Insane_Lugia lays low
<bluesun> bluesun says no :<
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think the script can do any hacks server-side
<Dman> um reticentsmolder i guess to move, but could walk on all 4 leaning on canon.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Okay.
<drfsupercenter> 03if it could I'd want 999 Oran berries :|
<Caaz> Well, it's an appropriate name for it.
<bluesun> once you choose a Pokemon, the server deletes every other Pokemon you've befriended :/
<RobotPinkie> After seeing the cut scenes from Other M, I'm pretty sure Samus is Derpy
<Caaz> Hn
<Dashite> :(
<bluesun> so even if you make your way back to the tree the list is empty
<GabeMoist> Derpy became a bounty hunter
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, imagine actually getting 9 pages of Pokémon a day
<Sumica> wouldn't the 4th be longer to leave room for the leg and the cannon?
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd fill your boxes up in like a week
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Rodman> Guys, hey guys
<Rodman> http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=655
<Angel_Espeon> 13DW always implies you can send more than one Pokemon at a time :<
<Rodman> Dunno if old news, but DAMN!
<Dman> nice shirt
<lightumbreon> 06BBL, Shower
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, it would have to be walking on 3 legs while keeping the 4th up and shooting
<bluesun> well, you can in certain situations
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, like events, right?
<bluesun> you can stock up Pokemon in the demo ver and then when you register a GSID you can transfer them over 10 at a time
<bluesun> iirc
<bluesun> and events, yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 using the hacking script on a demo account
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I sent my normal pokemon and event Espeon at once.
<ReticentSmolder> lol...I don't even want to imagine pony screw attack, but the sprint booster would look nice
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I mean she wouldn't be able to run as fast, for sure
<Angel_Espeon> 13I mean other than events .w.
<Dman> ... pony screw attack. probably just like normal, a load of forward rolls ^_^
<Sumica> sure a power suit could comensate for that
<Dman> robotpinkie - she could run fine, just not shoot and run
<Soital> 12Has that dodgy idea gone where if you send a shiny pokemon to the dream world it comes back original colours?
<bluesun> yeah, it comes back shiny
<Dashite> Pony Samus would use something like the shoulder mounted weapon Predator used.
<Dman> echo II
<RobotPinkie> I mean she could probably run and shoot, just not nearly as fast....
<Dman> yea
<Purple`Prose> Or like the dog from Jet Force Gemini
<ReticentSmolder> maybe...maybe the suit would have a built in sling for when she needed to run and shoot? or it would drop a stand?
<Sumica> ....why am I discussing the physics of a pony samus.
*Dermathil is back from college
<Purple`Prose> Back-mounted gun
<Soital> 12I'm not going to risk that anyway xD
<Sathi> 7wb Dermathil
<ReticentSmolder> @Sumica, because someone posted pony samus
<Dman> sumica, it's what we do
<Ziltoid> hey dermathil
<Dman> ohai dermathil. what u get up to in college?
<RobotPinkie> or maybe she runs on her hind legs while shooting, did you think of that? :P
<Dermathil> I gots my schedule and list of books to buy and stuff
<Dman> i thought of that ,but then went 'hmm...nah. it's ponies, they're not bipeds'
<ReticentSmolder> back mounted gun...she would have to duck her legs, and then it couldn't be an arm...erm LEG cannon anymore
<RobotPinkie> That would, of course, look absolutely ridiculous...
<Dman> how does it look for next year for you dermathil?
<Sumica> yes but i just caught my self joining in sort of a wait wut moment in my head.
<Dermathil> Dman, well, the next 15 weeks looks like they will be crammed full with studying.
<Dman> good lukc then man
<Dermathil> Also, I moved one of my classes from Wednesday (I DON'T want 7 hours of class in a row that jumps my dinner) over to my previously empty friday.
<Dashite> It always looks like that at the start and then I end up slacking off. :/
<Dashite> lol
<Dashite> No 7 straight hours? :p
<ReticentSmolder> I feel like Zero mission is babying me...actually telling me where I'm supposed to go? ppffft
<Dashite> RS, can't you turn that off?
<ReticentSmolder> maybe?
<ReticentSmolder> every time I get an upgrade the fucking statue says: GO THIS WAY
<RobotPinkie> lol Smolder, if you ever play Shadow Complex, turn off the guide lines
<Dman> sathi, do you know Professor layton?
<Ziltoid> THis lady is crazy
<RobotPinkie> Makes it just ridiculously easy to find your way... not fun.
<Sathi> 7yes I do
<EdwardNewgate> okay
<Sumica> oki off to go get payed for doing nothing again. Be back later.
<Dman> yay~ my request may or may not be 2 minutes of it =]
<Sathi> 7see you in a bit Sumica
<RobotPinkie> later, sumica
<Dman> later sumica
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you send a shiny to DW in the first place?
<roxsnow25> later sumica
<ReticentSmolder> so wait...in Super Metroid you're actually /returning/ to Zebes?
<RobotPinkie> lolol trollan
<EdwardNewgate> their faces when
<RobotPinkie> stream... behaving a bit weird for anyone else?
<Dman> yea reticentsmolder, i think so
<Ziltoid> nope
<EdwardNewgate> nope
<bluesun> to show it off?
<Dashite> Nope, all fine here.
<Dman> Robotpinkie - it disconnects me every 5 or som inutes for some reason
<ReticentSmolder> but both Zero Mission and Super Metroid take place on Zebes with different maps
<Dman> how is it weird for you?
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll look shiny on the island?
<bluesun> nah
<drfsupercenter> 03so then what's the point?> LOL
<Chimera> Hi AE and DRF
<RobotPinkie> It sometimes freezes the video, and disconnects me sometimes
<drfsupercenter> 03hi Chimera
<Dman> reticentsmolder, super metroid you go back to zebes. wiki: " She then follows Ridley to the rebuilt base on Zebes to stop the Space Pirates in their new plan to clone the Metroids and use them as a weapon. "
<Angel_Espeon> 13!chimera
<Dashite> RS, they had the technology. They rebuilt, bigger, faster, tougher.
<Dman> Yea robotpinkie, same
<RobotPinkie> Most of the time it looks fine, though
<Sathi> 7it's fine here i'm tuned in myself
*Chimera is Espypet :3
<Dman> d/c and occational 1 second freeze before continue
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Dman> it's just veemi
<bluesun> well, there are shiny events, like crown raikou which would be recognisably shiny via their OT
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean cannon fodder?
<Chimera> ^^
<Chimera> No
<Chimera> :|
<RobotPinkie> Might just be my connection that's fucking up, too.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh god
<drfsupercenter> 03running two VMs at once is really slow
<Dman> :/

<Dashite> ;)
<ReticentSmolder> hah, I knew it, who was saying that it didn't? :P

<EspyLacopa> Chrome + NotScripts seems to dislike embedding now. . .
<Sumica> *shock*
<EdwardNewgate> but it's GOKAIGER
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<Dman> GOKAI CHANGE
<RobotPinkie> Not really, House is better than most of the things you mentioned
<Pegacorn> GOKAI CHANGE!
<Barry> It's finally done. Chapter one of my LoZ: MLP story
<RobotPinkie> ...just not better than Japanese men in tights :3
<Barry> http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7303278/1/My_Little_Pony_An_Oceanic_Adventure
<L4DSmoker> Gokai *cough* Change *cough*!
<Rodman> Is the stream lagging to everyone else?
<GabeMoist> yes
<Ghosties> 4And I just don't care about Gokaiger
<Dman> BARRY WOOHOOOOO!!!
<Dashite> Nope, no lag here.
<Wrek> theres a slight lag but nothing major
<RobotPinkie> Yeah freezes up from time to time here
<Rodman> Ok, so nothing unusual then
<Dman> same robotpinkie
<Dashite> Maybe once an episodethe video will freeze for about a second or so.
<Sumica> wow
<Barry> Just let me know what you think
<Dman> but yea not unusual
<ReticentSmolder> we need a priest!
<Ghosties> 4...that's that one woman
<Pegacorn> THAT WOMAN IS A SPITTER!
<Ghosties> 4I can tell now
<Wrek> hate those rogues sleathing arround hemorraging
<Sumica> get a bucket in here plenty of blood now.
<Sathi> 7if it lags a bit just refresh
<Ghosties> 4Oh, what the fuck was her name
<L4DSmoker> I wonder what the other survivors think of Nick.
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<Barry> Ghosties, I don't think wtf was her name
<RobotPinkie> I think it's probably related to veemi, because I've checked, I'm not having connection problems.
<Hunter> Nick is tasty.
<Dman> yea robotpinkie
<Dman> happens to me too D:
<L4DSmoker> He sure is.
<Hunter> I wonder if the survivors know that.
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<L4DSmoker> Dunno.
<EdwardNewgate> mfw there's a vitamin K?
<Dman> eyup
<Rodman> BTW Dman
<Rodman> Sent
<Hunter> Maybe if we offered to share?
<GabeMoist> yes, there is vitamin K
<Barry> Yep, it's what helps blood to clot
<Dman> rodman ... D:
<GabeMoist> it's in yogurt
<Ghosties> 4The woman played Angela Orosco and Claudia Wolf
<Barry> Hemophilia is a lack of vitamin k
<Rodman> :D
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure of it, I'd recognize that retching sound anywhere
<Dman> and EdwardNewgate vitamins: A B1 C D B2 E B12 K1 B5 B7 B6 B3 B9
<EdwardNewgate> Gah, so many
<L4DSmoker> I wonder how the survivors would react seeing us comming.
<Hunter> Usually with bullets. :/
<Rodman> With bullets, like always
<Wrek> b-but wheres my vitamin F or G?
<Rodman> NINJA'D!
<L4DSmoker> Yeah,they're so mean!
<Barry> Not discovered, yet?
<Dman> EdwardNewgate (retinol, thiamine, ascorbic acid, calciferol, riboflavin, tocopherol, cobalamins, phylloquinone, pantothenic acid, biotin, pyridoxine, niacin, folic acid)
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<Hunter> Not on my screen Rodman. :p
*Hunter pounces on Rodman and starts to rip him to shreds
<EdwardNewgate> GAH, STOP DMAN MY HEAD HURTS
<Dman> vitaminF, wrek, is just fatty acids, and there's more than one vitamin F
<Dman> and vitamin G is riboflavin, too common to relaly be a 'vitamin'
<L4DSmoker> WOAH WOAH HUNTER!CALM DOWN!
*Barry puts rodman together again and revives him
*Rodman performs the EPIC PELVIC THRUST OF MANLINESS, banishing the Hunter to the Moon.
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<L4DSmoker> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Dman> also, wrek, vitamin G is now called B2, aka riboflavin
<Wrek> Dman, thanks but i was jsut mkaign a joke, a bad one at that but still. adn now the news.
*Hunter jumps around on the moon
<Hunter> Whoa!
<Dman> Aaaand Rodman...you sent it? D: D: D:
<Hunter> Look how high I can jump!
<Sumica> that's alot of hamburgers
<Rodman> Yup
<L4DSmoker> I CAN SEE THAT HUNTER!
<EdwardNewgate> Wrek Chimpanzee, Monkey news
*Dashite soars through the air
<Rodman> Dunno if Seth will even see the email
*L4DSmoker tries to look at the moon.
<Rodman> But its in his database now
*Hunter gets a running start
<RobotPinkie> :(
<Rodman> However, if he sees it, I don't doubt he'll post it
*Hunter leaps back down to earth
<Pegacorn> Hum....Infected....on the moon?
<Pegacorn> Do not want.
<Rodman> Seeing as Sethisto favorited the original Twilight one
<Dman> Rodman uhmm....
<L4DSmoker> Yay!Hunter is back!
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<Rodman> uhmm....?
<Dman> uhmm Rodman- why did yo-... O_____O
*Hunter lands on Rodman for 25k point pounce
<Pegacorn> Lolwut
<L4DSmoker> WOW!
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<Rodman> BECAUSE I'M LAWFUL EVIL DAMMIT!
<RobotPinkie> haha
<Chimera> Hm
<Chimera> How do I set FireFox to save my tabs when I close it?
<Espeon> 06lots of silly events in tf2 to render for no reason besides fun it seems.
*Rodman receives the Hunter with a second EPIC PELVIC THRUST OF MANLINESS, this time banishing to the Sun.
<Espeon> 06And I can't remember, I've just gotten used to task-killing Firefox to close it
<Espeon> 06|D
<Quanyails> 7Try Task Manager, Chimera. :P
<Chimera> Herp
<L4DSmoker> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Chimera> Hm?
<Quanyails> 7Abort firefox.exe. :P
<Espeon> 06Opens in "Restore Fans" stuff
<Quanyails> 7Or...
<Chimera> Ah
*Hunter drags Rodman with him
*L4DSmoker saves Hunter
<Quanyails> 7History, Restore Previous Session.
<L4DSmoker> I GOTCHA!
<Dman> wtf is going on in this chat
<L4DSmoker> *cough*
<Rodman> I have no idea
<Angel_Espeon> 13My firefox gives me the option to restore previous session every time I open it o-o
<Hunter> Whee! Smoker saves!
<Rodman> These two
<Chimera> K
<Sumica> skitsofrenia
<Chimera> It doesn't for me
<Chimera> XD
<Chimera> I'll task kill it
<Espeon> 06Mine did too but I accidentally clicked "don't show again"
<Espeon> 06and it never really had an impact anyway
<Chimera> ^
<ReticentSmolder> re-learning new timing on the wall jump fucking sucks
*EdwardNewgate nukes chat
<Pegacorn> Skitsofwutnao?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Mine doesn't do that o-o
<Chimera> Erm

<Chimera> AjNwodjwpd
<Rodman> Schizophrenia
<Sumica> I probably butched the spelling
<Quanyails> 7You can find it again under settings or whatnot.
<Dashite> I always found Zero Missing timing to be much easier.
<Chimera> @ Don't Show Again specifically
<EdwardNewgate> There it's OVER
<Angel_Espeon> 13It takes me to the firefox google homepage and underneath it says "restore previous session"
<ReticentSmolder> I'm too used to Super Metroid's
<RobotPinkie> Oh man if that video gets featured on EQD, my head will explode
<Pegacorn> What does Schizophrenia mean?
<Espeon> 06also my pc does not like rendering
<Espeon> 06xD
<Rodman> You mean Zero Mission, right Dashite?
<Chimera> Tools

<Dman> Pegacon, ninjad
<Chimera> Then what
<Chimera> Espy mine does ;3
<Sumica> it's the only way to be sure Edward

<Hunter> They shot at us first!
<Dman> Sathi, could it be to do with quality you're uploading?
<L4DSmoker> *cough*Yeah,they did.
<ReticentSmolder> @Dman, well, in my defense I'm trying to wall jump to bypass the space jump boots in an area :P
<Dman> perhaps it's too high for some? I mean it looks fine to me, and runs fine, but maybe for others?
<Dman> Ah reticentsmolder, u ninja
<ReticentSmolder> :P
<L4DSmoker> But really,i shouldn't attack too much.It's a bad habit i have.*cough*
<ReticentSmolder> I love the wall jump exploits, but I think they tweaked zero mission so you can't use them in certain places, ie places before space boots
<Sumica> one more time

<MajinMew> youritebrah
<ReticentSmolder> @Dman, I always think that game is Double Dragon for some reason...probably because that's the only fighting game from that era I played
<Dman> (RobotPinkie can u post pics of ur mane6? i made a folder for you and would like to have them :3)
<ReticentSmolder> I'm not gonna get it :(

<Silverscreen> 11House is an asshole.
<Purple`Prose> House is an awesome asshole

*Pattyrick runs
<Silverscreen> 11House would not last a day in an actual hospital. XD
<RobotPinkie> She will sue him so hard. Right in the face.
*Nick actually agrees
<MrPoniator> House would get fired for sure
<Dman> ah okies. so 6 lotto draws this saturday then?
<Dman> if so
*Dman finally gets it
<Spazturtle> House could just say he did not see the paper
<ValtheJean> only in america is treating people considered unethical...
<Sathi> 7We will discuss it and get back on it tomorrow
<Pattyrick> 07:P
<Dman> oh? still not actually decided? : /
<PeanutButterWolf> ValtheJean ^
<Spazturtle> He would actualy need to see the pice of paper for it to take effect
<Silverscreen> 11That move alone would have gotten his medical license removed.

*Nickario pounces Pattyrick and sits on him
<RobotPinkie> Dat sexual harassment lawsuit!

<Dman> yea MrPoniator
<RobotPinkie> I'm so glad Hugh Laurie seems like a nice guy in real life...
<Dman> sure is
<Wrek> give or take
<Dman> Um, MrPoniator, just incase you don't yet know, From FB: "The line up for tonight is: Goonies, Cutie Mark Chronicles, Buckaroo Banzai, Boast Busters."
<Pattyrick> 07Why you sitting on me?
<Dman> RobotPinkie, he bloody is an nice guy, a very nice guy.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I knew the lineup
<InsertCupcake> he is awsum
<MrPoniator> Just had to check the time
<Dman> okie dokie loki
<Sumica> that face
<Dman> installan / uninstallan?
<SilverMare> mfw i've yelled SCALPEL twice during kinky doctor and nurse play
<RobotPinkie> I love Hugh Laurie's songs
<MrPoniator> Dat install screen
<Dman> RobotPinkie, did you know Laurie made about 1/5 of the music in House MD?
<Dman> :D
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Dman> well, helped make
<Pattyrick> 07Hi Aero =D
<Dman> he ACTUALLY fully made about 10 or 15 songs for the show just on his own
<Aeroslash> hi pat!
<RobotPinkie> Did not know that, though I'm not surprised he did some of the music
<MrPoniator> That's quite cool
<Quanyails> 7Ah, Nick, I feel like I should be RPing with you. :P
<Dman> Hugh Laurie is one of those humans you just can't help but look up to, because of how much stuff he's done in one lifetime.
<MrPoniator> I kinda find it funny how you can get court martialized for actually saving someone's life
<RobotPinkie> He wrote a lot of funny songs for A Bit of Fry & Laurie, of course
<Silverscreen> 11House meets Law & Order
<Riders> Oh hai, random window
<Purple`Prose> That statement sums House up perfectly.
<RobotPinkie> My favorite comedy show growing up :D
<Dman> he's written a book, plays 6 instruments perfectly, acts brilliantly in many different (completely different) roles, perfectly, has a family, knows more than one language, has seen the world.
<Pegacorn> Hugh Laurie is BAWS
<drfsupercenter> 03alright, Quanyails, I can give you that Wooper now.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original poster art (not used on the video tape box) featured the cast dangling from the feet of another with the top one hanging on a rock. Some of the newspaper ads featured slightly different artwork with the characters drawn in a different order from top to bottom.

<Espeon> 06And she totally means tailtips, right?

*Espeon dies
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Reaver21> Was that the woman that plays MAtilda!?
<EspyLacopa> Wow, so they not only escape jail, but they set it on fire as they leave?

<Tyranico> EspyLacopa: That's the right way to do it
<ReticentSmolder> wow, small chat tonight, could it be because of the dinkypage redirect?
<Ersatz> A brilliant abuse of movie physics
<Bjornfot> BROlin
<Pegacorn> Josh Brolin is in this?
<Sumica> Yep
<ValtheJean> try ctrl ++
<Sathi> sorry dinky is still down :(
<Ersatz> Probably, Ret
<RobotPinkie> Are there ponies in this?

<EspyLacopa> RobotPinkie: Sadly no. That's why I was going to suggest the Fantastic Adventures of Unico.
<PeanutButterWolf> Which Corey overdosed?
<Combustiblelemons> no problem
<DragonRage> Thank you guys!
<Riders> Pegacorn = From Goonies to Jonah Hex.
<MrPoniator> I've a taperecorder just behind me, RainbowLoon...
<RainBroDash> someone used dinkypage sites to perform hacking on other sites
<Dermathil> Suddenly, POPUPS
<Dman> Dermathil: right click bro
<GabeMoist> kill the popups
<Pegacorn> Jonah Hex seems decent.
<RainBroDash> so the whole of dinkypage has been shut down temporarily
<Tyranico> Ohai Cory Feldman
<EspyLacopa> Just imagine if it starts meowing.
<MrPoniator> And a TV with an antenna like that
