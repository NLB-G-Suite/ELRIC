*Radiojazz runs to SuperBrony64 house to save him
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Invi|radioactive: bad Invi|radioactive
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane trips Radiojazz
<Invi|radioactive> It is just a possibility....
<Radiojazz> :C
*Radiojazz destroys Alicorn_Prince_Shane with the power of Chernobyl
<Radiojazz> >:3
<Malavolent> RP. Serious business.
<Invi|radioactive> It could be too that he baked a portal and is teleportlet to Equestria :)
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane is immune and deflects the power back at Radiojazz
<Radiojazz> No.
<Radiojazz> No you are not.
<Radiojazz> >:3
*ponyloverforeva ZzZzZzZzZ
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> yesh i am
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane IS IMMUNE
*Invi|radioactive combines radioactivity with Radiojazz and shoots highly intense gamma rays at Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> O HAI prince-dari bot
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane dodges
<Radiojazz> Radioactivity is scientifically capable of tranversing through any sort of barrier except heavy lead.
<Radiojazz> In other words.
<dshannon> awww no crisis...bugger
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ye so u shoot it at me
<Radiojazz> You're doomed. (Zecora)
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane run to the left
<Invi|radioactive> :)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i run to the left
<Radiojazz> No matter how fast you run, Radio waves travel faster.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> radiation haz no homing beacon
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i travel at the speed of light
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hwo bout that
*Invi|radioactive manages to uphold a constant ray of gamma ray laser and tries to aim at Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Radiojazz> Doesn't need one. It is a wave of energy.
<Radiojazz> Oh you are just one hell of a Gary Stu you know that... :|
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane runs around Invi|radioactive at the speed of light
<Radiojazz> You're taking this "alicorn" thing WAY too far.
<Radiojazz> Alicorns aren't even that strong.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> wats faster speed of light or radio waves
*Invi|radioactive stops the laser
*ponyloverforeva wakes up
<Radiojazz> They are just priviledge with special abilities.
<ponyloverforeva> anything on yet?
<Invi|radioactive> Alicorn_Prince_Shane it's both the same ^^
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane lands next to ponyloverforeva "nope"
<RainbowAsh> Radiojazz, Alicorn_Prince_Shane must be a changeling that fed on the combined love of the bronies, then
<Invi|radioactive> radiowaves=light
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> NO
<Invi|radioactive> yesh
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i am Bstate foal sitter lol
<Radiojazz> Daayuum, RainbowAsh! I would believe that! :O
<ponyloverforeva> oh well im gotta make a cloud muffin :P
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> :|
<Invi|radioactive> Alicorn_Prince_Shane :| I'm watching you
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Radiojazz: one doesnt not simply kill an alicorn
<Radiojazz> One does not simply become an alicorn. :|
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> thats why celestia sent luna to the moon
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ive always been a alicorn
*Radiojazz facehoof
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> it was established by the almighty eightball
<Invi|radioactive> not kill but radiating *touches Alicorn_Prince_Shane*
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> yay MOAR POWAH!
*ponyloverforeva makes cloud muffins and puts tray in cloud oven :P
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane absorbs the radiation
<Radiojazz> How one... Celestia did not send NIGHTMARE MOON to the moon by her own power. Who can tell me what she had to use in order to imprisson Nightmare Moon?
<dshannon> WaZaaaaaaaaaap!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol i love ponyloverforeva rp
<Invi|radioactive> Alicorn_Prince_Shane you can't you are now infected ^^
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i cant wat?
*ponyloverforeva sets time for 10 seonds
<RainbowAsh> Invi|radioactive, I have heard of radiation sickness, but radiation infection?
<Invi|radioactive> Radiojazz i only know that celestia tells vicious lies
<dshannon> he's now Nuclear_Alicorn_Prince_Shane?
<ponyloverforeva> 10 9 8 7 6...
<ponyloverforeva> 5 4 3 2 1
<ponyloverforeva> DONE
<Radiojazz> Invi|radioactive: ... you're kidding right? ...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lets see if it fots
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> that was 8 seconds
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> fits*
<Invi|radioactive> RainbowAsh radiation sickness is like a kind of infection
*ponyloverforeva takes cloud muffins out of oven
<ponyloverforeva> anyone want one? :P
<Nuclear_Alicorn_Prin> omg
<Nuclear_Alicorn_Prin> dam it
<Nuclear_Alicorn_Prin> didnt work
<Invi|radioactive> Radiojazz what I've heard, i don't trust Celestia anymore.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ages?
<Invi|radioactive> ponyloverforeva sure ^^
<ponyloverforeva> have a muffin
<Radiojazz> Invi... You shouldn't trust everything you hear... Especially since Celestia in considered THE most misunderstood character in the show!
*Invi|radioactive noms on fluffiest muffin ever :)
*ponyloverforeva gives muffin to Invi|radioactive
<Radiojazz> Do you know how hard Luna fans are on her?
<RainbowAsh> Invi|radioactive, I think it's more like a poisoning
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Invi|radioactive ate the muffin before it was given to her
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> how old are we all here?
<Invi|radioactive> RainbowAsh but you can't get it out of your body and it spreads... so i guess you are right ^^
<ponyloverforeva> ive tried making storm muffins once.....they turned out burned
<Invi|radioactive> Alicorn_Prince_Shane i used a gypsy portal
<ponyloverforeva> *ba dum tish*
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ponyloverforeva: Invi|radioactive RainbowAsh Radiojazz how old r you guys?
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :P
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> im 17
<Invi|radioactive> Radiojazz yes, but what if Celestia just wants the power
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey Spell-of-Gaming
<Invi|radioactive> Alicorn_Prince_Shane 18
<Invi|radioactive> moin Spell-of-Gaming
<ponyloverforeva> lets say im younger than 18
<RainbowAsh> Hi Spell-of-Gaming
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ponyloverforeva: 14?
<TheRandomkid321> Im back let me guess he is a sleep? *sigh* We all know the drill from wtahcing wiggles right? 3... 2... 1...
<Invi|radioactive> ponyloverforeva i would guess about 15
<ponyloverforeva> yes
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> whats that sneaking SuperBrony64 up to?
<Invi|radioactive> wohoo i won no price
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ponyloverforeva: rly?
<Radiojazz> Invi|radioactive: Why would she want the power? She has been ruling peacefully with Luna for who knows how many years and still ruled for 1000 years by herself. EVEN AFTER Luna came back, she still co-ruled with Luna. I can hardly see where Celestia would want the power.
<ponyloverforeva> yes
<TheRandomkid321> I suspect... CLOPPING!
<Radiojazz> And older than you, Shane.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TheRandomkid321: WHO
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Radiojazz: u 25?
<Radiojazz> No.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Radiojazz: 21?
<Radiojazz> No.
<ponyloverforeva> im off high school cuz ive got a cold :(
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> radio 40
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> bai ponyloverforeva
<Radiojazz> Cya ponyloverforeva.
<ponyloverforeva> Bai
<Invi|radioactive> Radiojazz she wanted to gain reputation. as you see on the canterlot wedding, everypony ignores Luna and at nightmare night, everypony fears her. so Celestia has the monopole of power
<ponyloverforeva> wait what?
<Invi|radioactive> c ya ponyloverforeva
<Radiojazz> Invi|radioactive... where did you hear this?...
<ponyloverforeva> why are you saying goodbye am i being banned?
<Invi|radioactive> Radiojazz i noticed it
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> pony_125: u said ur going to school
<Invi|radioactive> ponyloverforeva you said you were off to high school
<Radiojazz> Invi|radioactive: Can I send you something that change your mind?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol nvm ponyloverforeva
<TheRandomkid321> I sent him a message. It shouldt take to long to get to him.
<RainbowAsh> Hu? What? Did something move on the stream?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i just re read it

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol jks
<Radiojazz> It's a bit long, Invi|radioactive. But do hope you could take the time to read it. Even some of it. http://weskerwolf.deviantart.com/journal/Wesker10-s-Defense-Princess-Celestia-299732988

<Radiojazz> I'd like to assume that she was just sleeping.
<TheRandomkid321> Hey SuberBrony64... You alright?
<Radiojazz> But... There's nothing that really proves any of that.
<Invi|radioactive> yup
<RainbowAsh> Hi RaveBrony
<TheRandomkid321> There are a few things that can spontainosly kill someone... Im starting to worry.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> SuperBrony64: i think his brain derped
<Radiojazz> We could also assume that it was Nightmare Moon going crazy on the moon while Luna was trapped inside NMM's mind.
<Invi|radioactive> TheRandomkid321 lol a few things is good xD
<Radiojazz> Radiojazz: Invi infected me! D:
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> RaveBrony: come stai signor piccolo

<Ninjazz> Invi: I didn't know that. :S
<Monfang> You know a phrase that I see a lot in fanfictions dealing with magic?
<Monfang> 'Feedback Loop'
<Ninjazz> What does that mean?
<Monfang> I have a feeling that most of the time, it's used incorrectly
<Ninjazz> Usually the case.
<Monfang> You mean a Feedback Loop, Ninjazz?
<Ninjazz> Yes.
<Monfang> Very simply, Normally Input goes into a system and output comes out, right?
<Ninjazz> Yes.
<TheRandomkid321> still nothing? SHoudl we call the amberlamps?
<Monfang> In a feedback loop, some of the output goes into the input
<Ninjazz> Right... Yeah, I see.
<Monfang> http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Images/MacroscFig52.GIF
<TheRandomkid321> And a wild testicular pain appeared heh heh heh... ow...
<Invi> and it can enforce itself to unimagined powers
<TheRandomkid321> Seiosly shoucl we call the ambulance... Does anyone know wjhere this guy lives?
<Monfang> I think a good way to see it is like in metal manufacturing, you use the shavings and left overs from production(the output) to produce more by adding it to the input.
<Invi> TheRandomkid321 that's the information we all wanted to have. thank you for enriching our knowledge of your testicular pain.
<Invi> *about
<Ninjazz> Hmmmm. Now I see.
<Ninjazz> Thanks.
<TheRandomkid321> Invi I get that response alot.
<Invi> TheRandomkid321 i can't imagine why
<Ninjazz> Basically something like recycling.
<Monfang> Yes.
<Monfang> NOrmally, in output, there is waste.
<Monfang> A feedback loop can be some of that waste going back into the system to be reused.
<Monfang> HOWEVER
<TheRandomkid321> Seriously... SHould we REALLY call the ambulance.. Well I think he has died.. Mayby it was JEFF!
<Monfang> A feedback loop is not an effect of any thing going back to reapplly to the system.
<RainbowAsh> If the input provides close to the amount the system can handle, then a feedback loop can have bad results, though.
<Ninjazz> So how does that apply to magic?
<Monfang> Like in Magic, it is not a spell arcing around and striking or effecting the user. That is something else.
<Monfang> I was just reading a story where it was used to explain how the spell was effecting other people rather than the person who was using it.
<Invi> Ninjazz it's magic, it woks somehow ^^
<Ninjazz> Heh. :D
<Monfang> A better phrase would have been 'overflow' or 'seepage'
<Ninjazz> Right. That would have been a better word.
<Saturn> 08,01okay
<Saturn> 08,01so remember yesterday i shared a link?
<Monfang> No

<Invi> c ya woo.. gone
<Airpuff> o.o
<Ninjazz> Right. I think they just used it cause the word sounds cool.
*Invi hoofs Ninjazz a new coffee
<TheRandomkid321> ...WHO WANTS SOME COKE!?
*Ninjazz sips coffee
<Monfang> Well it can sound cool and be correct.
<Ninjazz> Danke.
<Ninjazz> I know. But it was used in the incorrect sense.
*Airpuff glares at TheRandomkid321 .... "What are you scheming .."
<Monfang> You can use it in the proper context once you figure out what is the Imput, the system that processes the input ad the output
<Invi> TheRandomkid321 no thanks i have my own special coke to uphold my PH
<TheRandomkid321> Airpuff what? See its not opened..
*Invi glomps SuperBrony64
<TheRandomkid321> wait
*Airpuff lift up a hoof "If thats the case i want one.."
*TheRandomkid321 hands Airpuff sealed can of coka cola

*Airpuff stares at TheRandomkid321 ... "tubarine?" -.-
<TheRandomkid321> Yep well... I hope ypou got life insurnace buddy..
<Invi> maybe it is just harmless desoxyribonucleinacid
*TheRandomkid321 flies awy extrememly fast

<Invi> or it is the juice of a giant yellow squid who lost a fight against a spaceship....

<Invi> dat twist
<TheRandomkid321> Aw man... Well I guess Im going to prison now huh? Will it be prison or jail?
<Invi> where is the difference?
<TheRandomkid321> In prison you get rapped

<Ninjazz> Wooden Toaster is good at that.
<TheRandomkid321> Invi nope
<Ninjazz> Some Tombstone's work too.
<Invi> I like rap as long as it isn't angry or something like that
<TheRandomkid321> I like eminem
<Invi> the prince of bel air for example sounds good
<Ninjazz> I prefer Hip Hop.
<TheRandomkid321> does anyone else smell gas?
*TheRandomkid321 passes out
*Invi puts on a small fire
<Invi> ok, then he farted himself to death

<Invi> fire is so fabolous
<TheRandomkid321> I have perefected cloning AH HA! So what did my clone do while I was gone?

<TheRandomkid321> SO did you fix the gas leak?
<Invi> TheRandomkid321 there was no gas leak, can I else wear fire?
<TheRandomkid321> Well how did he die?
<Invi> he fartet himself to death
<valoreins> anyone got an article about "how to think inside a chimney"?
<TheRandomkid321> oh... I do not belive that is possible but I dont have any proof against it.
<Invi> valoreins I didn't find one at the equestrian inquirer, maybe they will report about that later
*TheRandomkid321 walks into corner and plays with rubiks cube
<valoreins> lol good
<Invi> valoreins Fluttershy weaponized cuteness
<TheRandomkid321> Is it just me inquires about the reproductive esystem of ponys?
*TheRandomkid321 yawn.
<Invi> why? it is a normal gender based reproductive system
<Ninjazz> Yeah... Nothing unsual about it. :$
<Airpuff> Lol whats so wierd about it TheRandomkid321 ? xD
<valoreins> soeaking about fluttershy, 2 of my friends that i introduce to MLP just got insta-brony when they saw the fluttershy scene at the first episode
<TheRandomkid321> Invi well you never see any reproductive orgas so what. DO hey do it magically?
<valoreins> speaking*
*Ninjazz sighs
<Airpuff> TheRandomkid321: do you even see reproductive organs as you walk on the streets? -.-
<Airpuff> xD
<TheRandomkid321> Will my grammar ever improve unless Im trolling someone with bad grammar? The answer is... no
<Ninjazz> Feels like I'm just jaded to Fluttershy's character.
<TheRandomkid321> Airpuff Do people on the street walk round naked?
<Airpuff> TheRandomkid321: nope.
<TheRandomkid321> Exactly
<Invi> the reproductive organs are hidden under the fur until stimulized
<valoreins> is that a theory?
<Airpuff> -.- omg go look at a horse.
<TheRandomkid321> Invi. So what you are saying is... Al stallions are growers?
<Airpuff> TheRandomkid321: Yep.
<Airpuff> xD
<Invi> ok, i vote for changing the subject
<valoreins> i thougt ponies reproduce when a rainbow occurs, (see G 3.6 Over Two Rainbows ep)
<TheRandomkid321> Invi I do not
<Airpuff> Same here... -.-
<Invi> ok, what would be your cutie mark? /)^3^(\
<TheRandomkid321> Unless its somehow usable as clopping material fro my really bucked up friend is with me.
<Ninjazz> I have an idea that an Katana blade crossed with a saxaphone. That would be my CM.
<TheRandomkid321> And my friend just hit me for saying he was bucked up
<Invi> Ninjazz you play saxophone?
<TheRandomkid321> My CM would be an atari joystick
<Whooves> Hey everypony

<TheRandomkid321> What si this add now?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Airpuff XD=====D
<Invi> Hio I'm back. someone assinated my interwebz :(
<Airpuff> Wat Saturn ? xD
<Saturn> 08,01that means, logically and physically, a unicorn should be able to levitate another unicorn, who should simultaneously be able to levitate the first unicorn
<Airpuff> Wb Invi
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Invi
*Ninjazz hugs Invi
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> guess the time im at
<Whooves> i guess pinkie pie the hacker wears a pinkie pie mask
<Airpuff> Saturn: i guess?

*Invi hugwubblez Airpuff Alicorn_Prince_Shane and Ninjazz :)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Invi: 1300 seconds
<Ninjazz> My God, Saturn... If I'm thinking where you're going with that...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> can i haz u now Invi
<RainbowAsh> Saturn, it has already been established that a unicorn can lift herself.
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn and you cannot solve a single crime.
<Invi> me?
<Airpuff> That... or you can specialize in Windmagic like my pony does Saturn xD
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Invi
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> wheres mah reward
<dshannon> ah, but remember the case of shining armor, the more complex or sizeable a spell the more stress it puts on the wielder
<TheRandomkid321> Why si there blood on my rubiks cube?
<RoboGerbil> Saturn: why go through the trouble when you have hot air baloons, pinky inventions and erm... pegasi
<Trixie> Hey Everypony
*Invi throws the shiny rainbow super cupcake to the trash and hops on the back of Alicorn_Prince_Shane :)
<Invi> moin Trixie ^^
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TheRandomkid321: thats just catsup
<WindWhistler|Games> Uh...I was kicked?
<Ninjazz> Hello Trixie...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Invi
<WindWhistler|Games> Who is Leeroy anyways?
<Saturn> 08,01what i'm trying to get at here is that the ol' mutual leg-up fallacy *works* in Equestria
<Saturn> 08,01which is kinda awesome
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Invi: ur number 2
<WindWhistler|Games> AND I MISSED SuperBrony64 STREAMING!?
<dshannon> .....wut

<Invi> Alicorn_Prince_Shane number 2?
<Ninjazz> You did, WindWhistler|Games.
<Trixie> I heard superbrony got killed...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> WindWhistler|Games: technically he still is if u look at the stream
<RoboGerbil> WindWhistler|Games: youre watching SB stream right now
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> but some one shot him
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> just look at the stream
<Airpuff> One cannot question the ways of magic Saturn xD
<TheRandomkid321> ok then... WAIT! I remeber someone bursting out of my desktoop and stealing my cube... whoever did taht must be the murderur... But who was it?
<WindWhistler|Games> And did I miss something? I was kicked and the reason mentioned a Leeroy
<Invi> Saturn you should ask Cereal Velocity abou that, he even invented a portal to equestria
<Ninjazz> WindWhistler|Games: NO idea.
<Airpuff> √¥.o my nose started bleeding.. brb xD
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Invi: Airpuff WUZ on my back

<Airpuff> Ninjazz: its not very fitting really... :)
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane levitates Airpuff on to his back Invi u mind?
<Invi> nopedi dopti ^^
<RainbowAsh> Saturn, technically, the unicorns don't lift each other physically, but by using magic. That would be like someone lifting someone else with a remote controlled helicopter while that person would also lift you with a similiar devise, too.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> 1500 SECONDS now
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: What are you talking about? :$
<TheRandomkid321> Oh god... Depy_Ctrax just called us baked treets. SHE DID IT! AND SHE BAKED HIM INTO BROWNIES!

*Alicorn_Prince_Shane bucks TheRandomkid321 44.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> srs TheRandomkid321 theres fillies around
<TheRandomkid321> Derpy is thje killer
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: ..... But i like thinking of such =C
<Trixie> Whooves the killer
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Derpy_Ctrax: killed SuperBrony64 with muffins
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: Then you'll get more nosebleeds. :$
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowAsh: your faulty assumption there is that Newton's 3rd law somehow vanishes when using helicopters :P
<flutter_spin> I need brainz
<TheRandomkid321> No. SHe killed him then baked him into the mufins!
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: .. so worth it.. xD
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: :D
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> RainbowAsh: dont argue with Saturn he's SCOTTISH!
<Derpy_Ctrax> Omgash

<Derpy_Ctrax> Granny Smith to be exact
<TheRandomkid321> chat derped. Now where was I? OH YEAH!
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowAsh: consider the helicopter as a static system and perform nodal analysis on it. now do the same with my unicorn proposition.
*TheRandomkid321 unholsters 44. magnum
<valoreins> we all love sumerpan
<Saturn> 08,01and get back to me in a few hours when i'm back from mny exam
<doughnut_joe> Who took my name again?!?
<Trixie> Hey everypony i know who killed superbrony
<Dshcord> you?
<TheRandomkid321> Trixie who?
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowAsh: or rather, i should say, nodal force analysis
<Trixie> Dr.Whooves...
<Derpy_Ctrax> Anyone remember what the anime series was called? G---- Lagann?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> digimon digital monster digimon are the champions!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol woops
<Trixie> he was angry then mudered him
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> gurren?
<doughnut_joe> He.....he died?....no...
<Lil_B> hi everyone
<Trixie> I prove my point.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey Lil_B
<valoreins> ohai Lil_B
<Trixie> Hey Lil_b
<doughnut_joe> Trixie weres your evidence?
<Trixie> Umm
<Trixie> The sence of the crime
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> it was obviously Ninjazz
<doughnut_joe> :|
<Invi> For Discords sake, this is so annoying when i have to quit the Inerwebz when someone wants to phone
*Ninjazz sighs
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> cause Ninjazz is attempting to fly under the radar by not talking
<Invi> exactly Ninjazz ^^
<Ninjazz> Always one to point fingers, huh, Shane.... :|
<TheRandomkid321> I love how nice you guys are. Despite me carrying a firearm everywhere where I go, having a missing sticker from my rubiks cube taht matched the one at the crime scene. And having blood on my rubiks cube you still dont blame me. Thanks guys.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Ninjazz
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i iz kidding Ninjazz
<Trixie> And whooves stold his cube
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: is best ninja
<Trixie> What a idiot.
<Ninjazz> c:
<Trixie> Well seya guys
*Invi jumps again on Alicorn_Prince_Shane's back :3
<doughnut_joe> I need help
<Invi> c ya Trixie
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane rears
<Saturn> 08,01mfw RainbowAsh has actually gone away to do nodal analysis on both systems
<Ninjazz> Cya Trixie. Stop being so... cya.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> jeezus Invi suprise me much
<somepony_else> hello everypony
<Invi> :)
<Whooves> Im Back Everypony
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff: wanna come up again
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey somepony_else
<Ninjazz> Hey somepony_else!
<Invi> moin somepony_else
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ello Whooves
<doughnut_joe> <----- NEEDS Video game help
<TheRandomkid321> SOMEONE ELSE WAS JUST MURDERED!
<Invi> oh it's getting full here
<Lil_B> hi somepony_else
<RainbowAsh> Saturn: I can't see how that is relevant to the argument. I think it suffices to assume a helicopter is a devise that transfers an energy source into uplift. The same could be assumed for levitation magic.
<Invi> moin Lil_B ^^
<Airpuff> WHOOO DAAARES PINK ME AS I AM DRINKING SODA?! o.o
<Ninjazz> Hey Lil_B!
<Airpuff> ping*
<Airpuff> o.o

<Lil_B> Invi and? hows the soundtrack :D
<Airpuff> doughnut_joe: oooh? o.o
<Whooves> Did she say i did it?
<Invi> Lil_B as awesome as i expected ^^
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowAsh: if both systems are stationary in midair, the forces must be balanced. the force isn't balanced for the unicorns, except by magic
<TheRandomkid321> Well all clues point to me being the muderer but *shoots randomly inot te sky* What are the chanches of taht being the case?
<doughnut_joe> Airpuff its getting annoying :(
<Saturn> 08,01which is why it works
<Invi> Lil_B maybe even 20% cooler ^^
*Whooves pulls out desert eagle
<Ninjazz> Hey... Airpuff is not annoying!

<Twilight> O-o
<Airpuff> Awesome valoreins ^^
<GilDash> Sylandest: That's just the thing, it was one fixed year. If I'd closed the previous accounts when I should have, I'd have just gotten a phone call from them saying that they can't contact my account. Which means because I have no account to charge. The problem is they didn't inform me this time, I didn't have the funds to pay them so instead it counted as a bounced check, which is a charge, putting me in auto overdraft. I didn't find out about this b
<Invi> Lil_B but that's illegal
<Sylandest> valoreins: wow! This is good! :O
<Twilight> wats wrong with TheRandomKid?
*TheRandomkid321 pulls out bowie knife

<GilDash> Sylandest: I'm already with Natwest, I just was too young and stupid back then to know what to do. I'd taken all the money out but couldn't be assed to close them. :D
<Invi> SuperBrony64 back?

<Invi> valoreins who is dead?
<Phase4> Dear princess celestia, today i learned that windows has no concept of security and that it is trivial to get admin privilages from the guest account. your faithfull student, Phase4
<valoreins> SB, who else?
<Claude> Invi: you will need help if you are on the internet
<Kandarihu> I have a feeling SuperBrony64 fell asleep on the stream.
<GilDash> Phase4: HA! Really? :D
<LightTrooper105> hello everypony
<Ninjazz> Phase4: Get a Deluxe Aniversary Account. :P
<Ninjazz> Hey LightTrooper105!
<Ninjazz> Run.
<Invi> Phase4 it is windows duh. Celestia already knows that ^^
<Phase4> GilDash, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Claude> NOMNOMNOM
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Isn't that the advice you should be taking? ;)
<Invi> Claude the interwebz are a evil place
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Fire, remember? :$
*LightTrooper105 give everypony Pie flavor Pie
<GilDash> Phase4: And this is why if a theif has your computer your precious user password don't mean shit. :D
<Ninjazz> Pie flavor.
<Invi> LightTrooper105 but what flavour has the pie flavour in that pie?
<Airpuff> Dat pie flavor pie...
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Fires burn out after a while... this one has barely even started yet... ;)
<Phase4> GilDash, actualy thats for different reasons
<TheRandomkid321> I wish i ahd a pie falvoured pie
<Lil_B> Well, apple really isn't much better in terms of safty XD you can reset you Password per console with the second partition on your Hard Drive or even with the Backup CD XD
<GilDash> Phase4: Well, yeah, but it's still all because of horrible security oversight. :D
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I get the feeling if I keep this up I really am going to regret it. :$
<TheRandomkid321> Instead Im stuck with this icecream falvored icecream.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'd say really enjoy it. ;)
<Phase4> GilDash, this is privilage escilation, i can set it up so that next time you log in i get access to your account, and from there i can trick you into giving my code admin privilages
<LightTrooper105> Invi Pie flavor
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Been told that before. -_-
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Claude: x licking
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: x Ninjazz
<Airpuff> LightTrooper105: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEoGzl7P1s
<Airpuff> xD
<Invi> Lil_B but you can't get viruses because they isolate from everything what is not related to the company ^^
<GilDash> Phase4: I'd like to pretend I know exactly what you're talking about, but I have basic level knowledge. I kind of get it though. :D
<Ninjazz> I don't that sentence, Shane. :|
<Ninjazz> like*
<Phase4> GilDash, the theif has your computer one is not an oversite, data is stored plaintext and anyone can read any of your data without a password assuming they have physical access
<Invi> LightTrooper105 pie flavour ception much?
<LightTrooper105> Invi yes :D
<LightTrooper105> Airpuff :D
<Invi> :D
*Phase4 hugs GilDash
<Ninjazz> Phase4! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
*GilDash hugs Phase4.
<TheRandomkid321> GilDash Why do you try to attract every male you see? WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? Distracting us in order to steal the pie flavored pie recipe?
*TheRandomkid321 grabs 22. magnum rifle
<Airpuff> 'Dat pinkiepie flavour *-*
<GilDash> Phase4: I've no idea what you're talking about but I find it interesting all the same. :D
<GilDash> TheRandomkid321: Who said anything about male only? ;)
<RainbowAsh> Phase4, most computer security fails if you got physical access.
<Kandarihu> Windows passwords are good when you're taking your computer to a social event or you're HAVING a social event, and you don't want other people just nonchalantly getting into your programs. It won't stop a haxor, but it will stop everyone else.
<Lil_B> Invi but that on the other hand limits the user, and a well written virus will get arount (I'm talking mostly OSX here, not the iPhony stuff)
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You know you'd enjoy your time with me... ;)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I do actually. :$
<GilDash> Ninjazz: So why so hesitant? ;)
<Invi> Lil_B and that's why apple is crapple ^^
<Ninjazz> Just I'm scared at the same time.
<TheRandomkid321> GilDash everyone knows women belong either in the borthel or the kitching. Not in the security office... (joking joking calm the buck down)
<Ninjazz> ...
<GilDash> TheRandomkid321: I'm not the one getting worked up dear. ;)
<Airpuff> You're being unusually agressive today GilDash .. What gives? :$
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: She's pissed. :$
<Phase4> Scarlet, aus bronies rock /)
<GilDash> Airpuff: I have to make up for yesterday. I'm on fire. ;)
<Invi> lol
<Lil_B> Invi i still don't know if my next PC will be Linux or AmigaOS 4.1
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Yes, and that. :D
<Airpuff> GilDash: Well its your fault xD
<GilDash> Airpuff: Only partially. :(
<Scarlet> Hey Phase4
<TheRandomkid321> SHE AINT GONNA GET THE PIE FLAVOURED PIE RECIPE UNLESS SHE GIVES TEH SECRET PASSWORD!
<Airpuff> GilDash: ahahha
<Invi> Lil_B i don't even know amiga dingsda45.7
<GilDash> Airpuff: If people would listen to their own damned contract clauses I wouldn't be in this mess. :(
*LightTrooper105 sips apple flavor tea

<Ninjazz> I still hope things work out in your favour, GilDash. :)
<Airpuff> GilDash: .. ahaha i see x)

*GilDash hugs Airpuff.
<Invi> Phase4 we don't know
<Ninjazz> GilDash: And you just lost? :S
<Ninjazz> As far as the meme goes.
*Airpuff hugs GilDash back "Don worry it'll turn out alright in the end!"
<Invi> Alicorn_Prince_Shane you so quiet
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I never lose. I cheat. ;)
<Lambo> Ah, no N64 games anymore?
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Dear lord...

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Invi: i is watching videos about how gullible people are about Kony
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You know that you like it. ;)
<Lil_B> Invi Amiga=PC from the 80's with one of the most modern OSs, Fans still mak new versions of the OS, it looks rather cool
<GilDash> Airpuff: I know it will. It's just crap it had to be like this in the first place. *sigh*
<Ninjazz> GilDash: My honesty is going to get me killed if I really do speak it. :$
<Phase4> there he is
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Killed? I'm not *that* bad... ;)
<Airpuff> GilDash: know right unnecessery... but i gues it just "Had" to happen

<Ninjazz> Om: You bloody freakin bastard!
<Xer[a]> GilDash: When you appreciate school and the time spent there, like I do, you come to realize that you like it better than staying at home all day. It is for this reason that I am incredibly bored over the summer break.

*CrazyCherry hugs GilDash
<Meanwhile> Needs to be about 20% streamier.
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<Ninjazz> Hey Meanwhile.
<GilDash> WHY WON'T MY COMPANY ANSWER ME?! :[
<teh_Tharassan> hey Meanwhile
<Ninjazz> Kinda in a weird zone, atm. Beware.
*Ninjazz hides
<Meanwhile> A weird zone?
<Mutterguy> yeah I think the cat has gotten up tell me to go to bed too
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: Having problems? :S
<Meanwhile> Is that like the Twilight zone but more aptly named?
<Ninjazz> Ehhh.
<Ninjazz> No.
<Ninjazz> Hard to explain.
<GilDash> Seriously, you sign up for a contract but you can't contact them to get your blood starting hours? What gives?! :[
<Om> GilDash: Lazer interfirence
<GilDash> Om: I will hurt you *sooo* hard.
<Meanwhile> In other news, I went to the dentist earlier.
<Om> GilDash: Uh huh.
*GilDash smacks Om.
<Ninjazz> Which flavor of lollypop did you get, Meanwhile?
<Meanwhile> Pain flavour.
<Ninjazz> Owch.
<Invi1> testing
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: GILDY CALM THE FACK DOWN!!!
<Invi1> oh i hate it when my internet dies
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Was it red by any chance?
<Meanwhile> The filling I had done was apparently "only a little one" so I declined anesthetic,.
<Meanwhile> And it was a little one.
<Meanwhile> Until she took a fucking drill to it.
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: I WILL WHEN I GET AN ANSWER! THEY'VE HAD A MONTH TO GET ME MY HOURS! :[
<Ninjazz> Owch...
<Airpuff> How should i Pose her then guys? o.o
*Ninjazz pat GilDash on the back
<Meanwhile> Drill, then sander, then sander again. Then filling.
<teh_Tharassan> :S dat pain
<Ninjazz> Still hoping.
<Meanwhile> And then she sanded the filling.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Never say no to anesthetic.
<Om> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3075/
*GilDash hugs Ninjazz.
<RainbowAsh> Meanwhile, declining anesthetics at the dentist is usually not a smart move in my experience.
<twilight_sprinkler> GilDash: i once had my adenoids ripped out without anestesia
<Airpuff> Anypony? T.T
<Invi1> hio twilight_sprinkler
<Meanwhile> And then she cleaned my teeth with some kind of weird little drill thing.
<twilight_sprinkler> hoi Invi
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkler: See previous answer.
<twilight_sprinkler> or hoi Invi1
<Meanwhile> Which basically meant she stabbed me in the gumline right next to every single tooth.
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: Calm down. Just calm down.
<Invi1> lol my internet derped ^^
<Invi1> again...
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: It's not fair. :(
<twilight_sprinkler> GilDash: at least now i can brag about it:P the worst part came after the operation, when i began puking because doctor gave me too much of other stuff
<Meanwhile> Yeah, if I ever decline anesthetic at the dentist again someone kick me in the leg.
*Airpuff sighs
<Ninjazz> Will do.
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: I know. Life isn't fair. Just phone 'em again untill they respond.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkler: Doctors, eh? :D
<twilight_sprinkler> GilDash: ikr:P
<Invi1> Meanwhile my brother made good experience with it
*TrixieMuffin will offer anaesthetic for the kick
<Om> Airpuff: However you want.
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: It just keeps going to voicemail I've phoned them 5 times now, and I left a message yesterday. It's sort of important that a new employee needs to know when the hell to start! :D
<Airpuff> Om so noooo requests or what so ever? ._.
<Invi1> Airpuff as i said: Lyra
<GilDash> Airpuff: Draw my OC. :)
<Meanwhile> What're you doing Airpuff?
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: True... True.... :D
<Airpuff> I mean... i can do "Cute" or "shy" or anything ._.
<GilDash> Airpuff: "Aggresive." ;)
<Invi1> Airpuff Lyra as cute as possible
<Airpuff> GilDash: Well now im doing a lyra before that, give me a picture of your pony and ill see what i can do when im done with Lyra xD
<Airpuff> Invi1: .. so cute.. then x)
<Meanwhile> Make her enraged,.
<GilDash> Airpuff: I don't actually have a concept for her. I'd like to see what someone else comes up with. :D
<Airpuff> Meanwhile: but thats not really her style though, is it?
<Meanwhile> How do you know.
<Airpuff> GilDash: ahaha Well i can sure try that once.
<Meanwhile> She's a background pony.
<Invi1> Airpuff would you recommend something else than cute? ^^
<Meanwhile> For all we know she's beating Bonbon off screen.
<Ninjazz> With ALOT of fanon.
<GilDash> Airpuff: Did you see her when Flim and Flam tried to see their crap? She looked like she was going mental. :D
<GilDash> *sell
<Airpuff> Invi1: not really.. i was thinking maybe a bit like cute/shy mix
*CrazyCherry sneezes.
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: Bless you. :)
<Invi1> gesundheit CrazyCherry
<Ninjazz> What they said.
<GilDash> Let's phone them. AGAIN. :|
*Airpuff blesses CrazyCherry with holy smoke xD
<Mutterguy> GilDash...cutie mark = a pair of fluffy handcuffs
<Ninjazz> Still hoping.
<CrazyCherry> Airpuff: Excuse me?
<Airpuff> Anyways then, ping me if you want anything, im going to draw xD
<Invi1> Ninjazz hoping what?
<Airpuff> CrazyCherry: one says "bless you" when somepony sneezes..
*TrixieMuffin is going to play Borderlands , because it has "plot-missions"
<Ninjazz> Her day gets better.
<Airpuff> CrazyCherry: so i blessed you xD
<Meanwhile> Plot-missions.
<GilDash> THEY JUST PUT THE BLOODY PHONE DOWN ON ME! :[
<Airpuff> Anyways, ping me if its something you wanna say xDD

<CrazyCherry> Wait a sec...
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I haven't even started yet! I'm just trying to get my bloody dates sorted out.
<CrazyCherry> The mods are asleep POST HUMANS!!
<Ninjazz> I believe "pissed" no longer covers this.
<Meanwhile> 5 bits says when someone finally does answer you they don't know your hours.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I could defenestrate something so *hard* right now.
<Meanwhile> Mods are asleep. http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/009/754/AnBWa.jpg
<Invi1> Ninjazz so she is really angry now? on you?
<Ninjazz> I don't even know what defenestrate means...
*Om moves away from GilDash
<GilDash> Meanwhile: If that's the case I'm just turning up at 8 and saying fuck you. I've been kind enough to wait a month, I'm not going to put up with stupidity on their part.
<Ninjazz> Invi1: No. Not on me. Just a bunch of ass holes.
*Mutterguy hands GilDash a CRT tv. he's seen a couple on the freeway embankment
<GilDash> Mutterguy: ... Thank you. :)
*GilDash defenestrates CRT TV.
<Invi> Ninjazz why? what did they do?
<Ninjazz> Invi: Basically professionally trolling her. But if you want the full story scroll up.
<Ninjazz> Wait...
<Ninjazz> Your internet derps, right?
<CrazyCherry> I hate allergies....
<Invi> yup
<Meanwhile> I'm allergic to alergies.
<Meanwhile> And Whoopi Goldberg.
*Mutterguy decides to defenstrate a box of tennis balls for the hell of it
<CrazyCherry> I'm allergic to you!!!
<CrazyCherry> Wait what?

<GilDash> Meanwhile: Why Whoopi Goldberg? :S
<GilDash> WallDives: Holla! :)

<GilDash> Meanwhile: Valid point. :D
<WallDives> Because Theodore Rex, thats why.
<GilDash> WallDives: ... Okay...
<WallDives> its a really shitty movie that sunk Whoopi Goldberg's career.
*CrazyCherry is playing Minecraft.
<GilDash> WallDives: Oh, that makes more sense.
*Mutterguy vaguely remebers a simpsons joke involving porn of Whoopi goldberg... this was about 13 years ago
<Om> No wonder I havent seen it
<Meanwhile> You should have bought a squirrel.
<Mutterguy> or it might have just been nude pictures
<CrazyCherry> I like whoopi!
<WallDives> Mutterguy: either wouldnt be too attractive...
<Om> whoop whoop
<Ninjazz> Hey WallDives.

<GilDash> WallDives: I've phoned them up five times for the past two days. :D
<Bronysith> Malavolent: once you get used to her horn its not that bad
<Malavolent> Bronysith: I believe so.
<GilDash> WallDives: I've emailed them now too, so I'm just going to keep up until I get an answer.
<WallDives> GilDash: maybe this is me being direct (aka American), but have you actually been there and talked to management?
<GilDash> WallDives: I went there for an interview, yeah. THey said they were in the process of sorting out the hours. They've got back to me with the start date but not the hours.
<WallDives> GilDash: ah...then I guess you just wait until the start date then.

<GilDash> CrazyCherry: Are you not entertained? :D
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: Maybe........
<Om> I have a keyboard on my laptop, how fancy am i?
<Michael> lol
<CrazyCherry> Om: I have it too.
<Ninjazz> And tea has been sacrificed to make me feel better.
<Ninjazz> It's an odd feeling.
<Om> CrazyCherry: But are you using two computers at the same time?
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz: :P
<Ninjazz> 6_9
<CrazyCherry> Om: Nope.
<GilDash> Om: I must be fancy too then. :)
<Om> GilDash: You're british. Thats atumatic semi fancy
<GilDash> Om: I'm Yorkshish. That's an automatic inverse. :D
<Om> GilDash: How so?
<Om> Is that like rednecks for English?
<Ninjazz> lol
<GilDash> Om: We're like anti-posh to make up for the poshness of the rest of England. :D
<Ninjazz> Fancy rednecks.
<GilDash> Om: Not really, just stuck in the coal mines. :D
<WallDives> why am I laughing? I'm american, I shouldnt know where Yorkshire is...
<Om> GilDash: Sounds...Eh-fun?
<Ninjazz> WallDives: You watched too many movies and stuff.

<Om> With a hard southern accent, there sin't a difference in pronounceing Bag. And Big
<Invi> *BOOOOOOOOOOOOM*
<Invi> now it was loud
<GilDash> WallDives: Yeah, Yorkshire is one of the few places not too badly represented in Movies. :D
<Om> GilDash: I don't watch movies tho!
<WallDives> GilDash: I thought Yorkshire is equivilant to like West Virginia and stuff.
<Invi> Ninjazz how can you kill tea?
*Michael eats a donut
<Ninjazz> Well, today is probably the day that kills me.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: How do you kill tea? Without Airpuff here to tell me putting half a bucket of sugar in, of course. :D
<Ninjazz> You drink it.
<Invi> Ninjazz no, that day will come, but not today
<Ninjazz> Naw.
<GilDash> WallDives: I don't know West Virginia, so I couldn't comment. :D
<WallDives> besides, I dont watch too many movies.
<Ninjazz> You guys saw me depressed on Monday.
<Invi> Ninjazz but then it lives inside of you and becomes a part of you
<Ninjazz> Because I failed Spanish.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You know English, you'll be fine. :)
<CrazyCherry> Here i come with the bad time mind.... I has to go....
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Might have failed that one as well. :S
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: You have no idea how much I want to defenestrate you right now. :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Disregard failure, enjoy oneself. :)
<Ninjazz> Anyways, this day I have the TWO worst subject today.
<Om> GilDash: That sounded. Odd.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: My philosophy.
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: I do.... I want to do the same.
<Meanwhile> Nyeeh, my gums are still sore from the dentist and I just got mouth burn from my tea ;n;
<Ninjazz> Owch, Meanwhile.
<GilDash> Om: Quiet you. ;)
<WallDives> GilDash: coal mines and backwater places.
<Om> GilDash: I don't know how!
<GilDash> WallDives: Yeah, with an influx of immigrants to the point where the previous immigrants are moving out for new ones. :D
<Ninjazz> So anyways, if you guys see me again today, expect the |Depressed tag again.
<Om> Meanwhile: Have you ever had a tooth growing out of the roof of your mouth?

<GilDash> WallDives: I need people to bounce off of. ;)
<GilDash> WallDives: If you're offering...
<Om> WallDives: Take this Lazer and run!

*Om gives WallDives lazer
<GilDash> WallDives: I'll keep a note of that. ;)
<Ninjazz> Happens to me everytime...
<WallDives> besides, I'm not content being a number. I are too greedy.
<GilDash> WallDives: You'd better try and make an impression then. ;)
<WallDives> noted.
<Om> WallDives: Don't, its not worth it.
<GilDash> Om: Shh, you. You don't know yet. ;)
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow I'm almost done with season 1 already in my daily MLP
<Om> GilDash: Perhaps not, but I found matches
<WallDives> Om: Let me make that decision.
<Michael> song for waiting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEDgd5h-GwY
*GilDash confiscates matches from Om.
<Om> WallDives: I cant let you do that Star-er WallDives

<GilDash> Om: Only when you explain to me fully what you intend to use them for in a way I can understand. :)
<WallDives> GilDash: I KNOW its Lylat Wars in the UK, I dont know if it is in the rest of the region.
<CrimsonPhoenix> stepÔªø 1: download this song, step 2: put it on MP3 player on repeat, step 3: go fishing, step 4 (optional):obtain hat.

<Invi> fight? where? who?
<Ninjazz> It's not a fight
<Om> HE WANTS MY BODY!
*Michael stops fight
<GilDash> Om: He's not the only one. ;)
*Ninjazz raises eyebrow
*Om runs away from chat to make oatmeal
*Ninjazz sits in a corner
<Invi> i demand a nice, calm and peacefull fight until death :)
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Well, looks like we're alone again. :)
<Ninjazz> Again...
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Hey, how's your studying going? :)
<Ninjazz> Terribly. I hate numbers.
*Om boops Ninjazz in the face hard before leaving again
<Ninjazz> Ow...
<Ninjazz> Deserved that, I guess.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Keep going at it, alright. I'm going to chase Om for now...
*Invi grabs Om and gives him ni Ninjazz
<Invi> *to
<Ninjazz> Ni!
<Michael> :[ no fights!
*GilDash teleports on top of Om.
<WallDives> GilDash: you're going to chase the poor guy until the end of time, arent you?
<Invi> NI Om NI
<Om> That means never, not no
<WallDives> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lav-VxMX59w
<GilDash> WallDives: There's only two options, and I'm not waiting long enough for one of them. :)
*WallDives sighs
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey are we still on zelda?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337787467161.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause this is relevent
<Ninjazz> Nope.
*Om senses a disturbance
<WallDives> starfox -> LoZ
<Invi> CrimsonPhoenix sorry, too late
<Michael> CrimsonPhoenix: lol the pic
<GilDash> Om: How do you like your new hat?
<Om> GilDash: You aren't wearing one?
<CrimsonPhoenix> meh Starfox is good
*Invi pokes Om's hat
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the series went beyond shit after 64
<Applechip> Have you guys checked out the Dr. Whooves, how do i describe them ... youtube audiobooks, thats all i can think off
<WallDives> also, the vid link I posted above made me so jealous.
<Invi> Applechip i heard some, yes
<WallDives> CrimsonPhoenix: I think I might be one of the few that actually liked Assault.
<WallDives> It's kinda like Starfox Battlefield.
<GilDash> Om: Fedora, actually, but how do you like your new one?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll have to be honest though Assault was decent
*GilDash places hooves on Om's head.
<WallDives> I liek fedoras...
<CrimsonPhoenix> but nowhere near as good as 64
*Meanwhile doesn't know anything about Starfox.
<Om> e_e
<CrimsonPhoenix> since it was story based and not arcade based
<Invi> Meanwhile ditto
<WallDives> Meanwhile: Starwing and Lylat Wars where you are.
<Ninjazz> Aye.
<Ninjazz> All I know is "DO A BARREL ROLL"!
<Om> Its old and not very stylish
<Meanwhile> I don't know anything about either of those either WallDives
<Invi> Ninjazz all your base are belong to us
<WallDives> meh. too bad then.
<prince-dari> Wow, a wild Stormy.
<CrimsonPhoenix> INvi that's....Zero Wing
<CrimsonPhoenix> I actually played the game
<Ninjazz> Invi: Move zig move zig move zig move every zig.
<CrimsonPhoenix> god damn it's hard
<Ninjazz> WHAT YOU SAY?
<WallDives> but seriously, almost 700 hits in Area6? WTF?
<Ninjazz> I think I'll rest my back for a while.
<Om> That is what I think of my hat. Old and not stylish.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Have fun in bed. ;)
<Invi> lol
<WallDives> I was jumping around like a kid after getting 550.
<Ninjazz> Almost didn't even need to come back to the computer to know who pinged me.
<WallDives> Zero Wing was...I dont know.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: :D
<WallDives> by shump standards, its easy.
<Om> Ninjazz: DREAM OF TRIXIES!
<Invi> nighty Ninjazz
<Meanwhile> Seeya Ninjazz

<Michael> bye Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> I'm just resting my damn back, guys.
<GilDash> Om: That's just cruel. :D
<Ninjazz> I still got lots of work to do.
<Invi> oh lol oky ^^
<Om> GilDash: I am a cruel person
<Ninjazz> And Om. Die. :|
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'd mute your computer if I were you. ;)
<Om> Ninjazz: Make me xD
*GilDash tackles Om.
<Ninjazz> Don't need to. :P
*Invi tackles Om too
<Om> Not yoooooou!
<GilDash> Om pile on!
<Meanwhile> Time is killing everyone. Really slowly.
<WallDives> not fast enough for some, though.
<Meanwhile> Sad but true.
<Invi> kill time before it kills you
<teh_Tharassan> still no stream?
*Michael kills time
<Invi> yup
<WallDives> teh_Tharassan: nope.
<teh_Tharassan> :(
<Invi> Michael fail ^^
<Invi> this chat is so undead
*valoreins stop rime
*Om crawls out of pile "You cant kill me! I'm INVINCIBLE!"
<valoreins> time*
<GilDash> Is the chat actually quiet enough that I feel compelled to start writing? :D
<WallDives> Om: you're a loony.
*Invi grabs Om and pulls him back
*GilDash Cue liquid nitrogen freezing Om.
<WallDives> GilDash: almost. I can see you grabbing citrus.
<valoreins> let's play fluttershy's game, keep silent!
<WallDives> I lose.
<Meanwhile> Me to.

*Om is frozen
*Invi hits frozen Om with a huge Sledgehammer
<WallDives> ugh. so much fun here, I dont want ot deal with people...
<Invi> lol
<Ninjazz> Alright, enough of tha... What is going on here?
<GilDash> WallDives: Ironically, I don't write with citrus fruits unless someone else is involved. :D
<valoreins> magic happened
<Invi> nothing <_< >_>
<Ninjazz> :I
<valoreins> magic is my answer to everything
<WallDives> I almost feel baited into responding to that, GilDash. Almost.
<Om> Why would you write using citris? Isn't that a liquid? Does it make good ink?
<Ninjazz> That's how it usually happens, WallDives. Trust me.
<WallDives> I know. curse me being too smart to not fall for it.
<Ninjazz> Let's see how that scan is going.
<WallDives> serious note though, sending my form to declare my major today.
<Ninjazz> Just some warnings.
<GilDash> WallDives: Play dumb. You'll have more fun. ;)
<Om> WallDives: That is a like don't listen to GilDash

<Invi> Ninjazz she just wants attention, and hating = attention
<Om> Ninjazz: yes she is.
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives......''I hate losing''-Akuma
<Ninjazz> And hundreds love her for it.
<Om> Ninjazz: Love and tolerate mang.
<Invi> that's how people work
<Ninjazz> Let me be one of the people who don't love her for it.
<Ninjazz> Om: That only applies to trolls.
<Invi> there is always somebody out there that loves it, no matter what it is
<GilDash> Ninjazz: *Why* is she a narcissitic attention admirer?
<WallDives> I...I have to win...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Who we talking about?

<GilDash> WallDives: What do you mean you have to win?
*Invi pokes CrimsonPhoenix with a stick against the head
<CrimsonPhoenix> unless I'm in HRT I'm in no way a girl
*GilDash noms on Om's ears.

<WallDives> GilDash: tournament. Actually, anything really, I HATE losing.
<Michael> hai alexxm
<Om> GilI think it means he doesn...-______- want to lose
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Why? The way she carries herself. She gets into competitions AJ, RD, or Rarity don't touch her, but when she does something she physically harms them. Then she lies about something and two idiots nearly destroy a town because of it.
<Ninjazz> Bleh.
<GilDash> This chocolate is so deliciously cold. :)
<TrixieMuffin> Stop confusing the"act" with the real pony behind it ! Ofcourse shes boasting and embellishing on stage , she has to keep her audience entertained.
<Ninjazz> I hate talking about it anyway.
<Ninjazz> All fanon.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I don't mean why is she seen that way, I mean why is she like that in the first place?
<WallDives> all of it.

<Ninjazz> GilDash: Show pony.
<cachi01> i really fucking miss youuuuu
<WallDives> ooh, GilDash being intellectual. I like.
<Om> My ears will be comiting Van Goh if you keep trying to ingest them GilDash >.>
<WallDives> cachi01: what?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: And you're right. It's all fanon Somepony who has a problem like that needs some kind of background, and most people will have some kind of sypathetic one for her.
<cachi01> WallDives: i got addicted to tenacious D
<Invi> CrimsonPhoenix nah, you should have read the other comics before first ....
<WallDives> ah. Get any better in Skullgirls?
<GilDash> WallDives: I can be intellectual when I want. I just prefer not to. Too much fun. :)
<WallDives> I noticed.
<Invi> GilDash ikr? ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh
<GilDash> Om: Unless you really want to cut your ears off, I'm going to keep doing this. And you merely saying so isn't enough to change my mind. ;)
<cachi01> WallDives: npe lol minecraft has my life now lol
*GilDash noms Om's ears.
<WallDives> boo~.
<Invi> GilDash why actually the ears?
<Ninjazz> GilDash: It pisses me off. She gets so much love for being such a HATEABLE character, and then we have other ponies who DONT deserve hate, yet here comes the hate train! CHOO CHOO! I feel so down... :(
<cachi01> i like trains
<Om> Invi: Don't encourage it further.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I like Gilda. Look at what I've got to put up with. :D
<Invi> Ninjazz stupid people are stupid
<Dken2021> indeed
<GilDash> Invi: I... like ears... :$
<Invi> GilDash i see.... ^^
<Ninjazz> GilDash: She yelled at Fluttershy... >_> You know how fans can get.
<GilDash> Invi: And Om's taste strongly of coffee... :)
<Invi> they do?
*Invi nomz on Om's ear
<Om> Invi: No, its just an excuse
<Om> Defaq!?
<alexxm> i've done the first draft of the article
<Michael> brb
<cachi01> and guys whats with the RD x fluttershy kiss at the wedding???? i didnt saw it at what frame or in what moment did it happened?
<Ninjazz> Not a kiss.
<Dken2021> somewhere when the changelings attacked
<Ninjazz> I checked frame by frame. No kiss.
<Invi> Om can i get a piece of that?
<Ninjazz> Just some weird noise.
<Om> e______e You ponies, are terible
<Dken2021> but it might as well be since everyone's so riled up about it
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Yeah, they overlook everything else about her and point straight to that. She's a bitch, first and foremost, but what fascinates me is she will do anything to try and keep RD close. To me it looks like more than her just wanting control. She can't despose of her; that's proven when she splutters at RD before bailing.
<Cobellanez> No kiss
<Invi> Om or you are just terrible and we are normal <_<
<cachi01> i checked invader zim frame by frame...... got nightmares for a week
<GilDash> Invi: So, do Om's ears taste like coffee? :)
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Aye. So true. So true.
*Ninjazz sighs
<Ninjazz> I fucking hate numbers.
<Dken2021> don't you just love how people take things too far?
<Invi> GilDash yesh, I liek :3
<Om> Invi: Ah!-...maybe...
<Ninjazz> OH ABSOLUTELY.
<Ninjazz> (sarcasm)
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I like to look at the entire character. Yes, Trixie is a show off obsessed loud mouth. But in the time of need she also tried to put up a fight against the Ursa Minor, even if she knew it was a losing battle. Why? Why not bail?
<Dken2021> because she overestimated the usra?
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Thing is, I know that part. I understand that part. But, I can't over the fact that her fanon rather irritates the living piss out of me.
<Dken2021> or underestimated
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Welcome to life, where we all live in denial. :)
*Ninjazz sets head on desk
<Dark92Enigma> GilDash Show Off? That sounds like something Dolph Ziggler would say
*cachi01 sets desk on head
<GilDash> Dark92Enigma: It's not a uncommon phrase. :S
<ACS13123> this song...
<ACS13123> :D
*Om on set head desck
*WallDives whops Dark92Enigma.
*GilDash strokes Ninjazz's mane slowly.
<Invi> who is dolph ziggler?
<WallDives> no. no wrestling refrences.
<Dark92Enigma> GilDash i know i was being sarcastic
<WallDives> Invi: Wrestling.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It'll be alright on the night. :)
<cachi01> Invi: WWE
<Ninjazz> I hope so.
<Invi> hm, my grampa watches that
*Dark92Enigma gets whooped
<GilDash> Dark92Enigma: Doesn't help that the internet doesn't translate sark and I've no idea who Dolph Ziggler is. :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Stone Cold is best wrestler
<Invi> GilDash it appears to me, that it seems to be a wrestler
<cachi01> couldnt remember the best song in the wooooorld no this is just a tribute..
<GilDash> Invi: A what now? :D
<WallDives> CrimsonPhoenix: stone cold is a joke, nWo.
<Om> Cold Stone has good icecream
<Invi> GilDash a wrestling fighter?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nah Stone Cold is best wrestler
<GilDash> Om: Maybe we should go get some ice cream?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that's the bottom line
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause Stone Cold said so
<GilDash> Invi: I was being intentionally dumb. :D I know what it is I just don't care for it.
<Dark92Enigma> ''Unlike you, i can prove it, by stealing the show every single night.......#HEEL''
<Om> GilDash: Don't you already have some?
<Ninjazz> Aye. Om.
<Invi> GilDash oh lol
*Claude licka Ninjazz
*GilDash spills ice cream on Om.
*Claude licks alexxm
<GilDash> Om: Whoops. :$
<Dark92Enigma> Undertaker is the best wrestler
*Ninjazz wipes off drool
<Om> -_-
<Ninjazz> Hi Claude. -_-
<WallDives> Undertaker is ancient.
<cachi01> The Rock is best wrestler
<alexxm> hey Claude hows your day been
*GilDash licks the ice cream off of Om.
<cachi01> but undertaker is cool
<Om> I know enough GilDash, to know where that was going
<Claude> good thanks alexxm you?
<Invi> Ice? Ish want Ice cream too :P
<GilDash> Om: You mean you saw through my carefully plotted plan of attack? :D

<Ninjazz> Likes like Om has some work to do.
<Om> GilDash: You're both doing it wrong.
<Ninjazz> Have fun.
<Invi> GilDash Om is so dirty with all this ice cream
*Claude licks GilDash
<alexxm> well WallDives i hope daniel bryan gets a rematch
*GilDash licks Om eagerly.
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives who do you think is the best right now? I'm between Y2J and CM Punk
<GilDash> Invi: I know! I might need some help. ;)
<Dark92Enigma> but mostly Y2J
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: in WWE? CM Punk, without any doubt, since Jericho is about to leave again.
<alexxm> i like both Dark92Enigma but i hope daniel bryan gets a rematch
<Om> Does anyone know an obscure god I can pray to?
<alexxm> gozer Om
*Invi covers Om in chocolate gravy
<WallDives> In Wrestling in General, I like Bobby Roode.
<GilDash> Om: Airpuff is a god apparently. :D
<Om> Invi: You >.>
<Invi> Om I <.<
<WallDives> if Airpuff is a god, I must be a athiest, cause I dont believe it.
<GilDash> Invi, Om: Mmmm...

<Om> GilDash: No thanks to you, oh wait. This WAS your doing!
<Bronysith> alexxm: kelio
<GilDash> WallDives: Not always. There's a reason I'm "Godslayer." ;)
<GilDash> Om: I didn't pour the.. chocolate... on you...
<WallDives> I'm going to leave that one alone.
<Om> Invi: Why are you engouraging it?
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives there is no doubt that Punk is superior in wrestling terms (Hell, i'm a straight edge myself) BUT IN Showmanships terms Y2J is the second best next to the Rock
<Michael> hai Bronysith
<Om> GilDash: But you sure are more than ready to lick it off eh?
<Invi> Om because i find it funny ^^
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/lPSe6
<Om> Invi: Har har.
<GilDash> Om: It's going to take some time...
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives i heard he's about to leave again........He needs a title rematch
<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: remember, the only wrestling that matters in within the past 3 months. and jericho has been dissapointing.

<Magical_pablez94> hey there Meanwhile
*Bronysith getes more tea
<Malavolent> Is there a lot of fighting in IP man?
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<Bronysith> not everything is about fighting
<Bronysith> lol
<alexxm> Midnight_Tempest: i got ip man for my dad a few christmasses ago
<Meanwhile> But it's not fighting so much as
<Bronysith> thats why i love the OT of star wars. it doesnt focus purely on lightsabers
<Magical_pablez94> who is wrek's subject?
<Bronysith> Magical_pablez94: its kirzstryfe whom is drawing
<Meanwhile> Watching a dude beat the stuffing out of everyone silly enough to try and mess with him.
<Magical_pablez94> Bronysith: whaaat??? seriously??? omg :D:D
<pinkiepie678> :) random twilight
<Invi> Meanwhile a dude or the dude?
<Bronysith> pinkiepie678: my fav pony
<Midnight_Tempest> the fighting in Ip Man is brutal though... you dont mess with a guy that knows Wing Chun...
<alexxm> why not both Invi
<Meanwhile> Invi: What's the diffference.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: u missed magic dance
<GilDash> Bronysith: The lightsabre fights were crap in terms of choriography, but still end up being the best fights due to characterisation and build up. :)
<Radu> wat http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-fluttershy-will-always-get-her-way.png
<Meanwhile> You remind me of the babe.
<Magical_pablez94> Bronysith: btw.... who is the subject?
<Invi> Meanwhile the dude, don't you know the dude lebowski ^^
<Bronysith> GilDash: the OT had the best lightsaber duels. you could feel emotion
<Meanwhile> Nah never seen that Invi
<Bronysith> GilDash: luke was a novice and you could tell
<Invi> Meanwhile then request it
<GilDash> Bronysith: Exactly. :)
<cachi01> Radu: xD
<DiscordsMaker> Who or what is he drawing now?
<cachi01> DiscordsMaker: a pony
<Radu> Poni
<Bronysith> GilDash: but it wasnt about the lightsaber. it was about the struggle behind it
<Radu> Oh my.
<Meanwhile> I've already voted this week. And I'll forget by next week.
<MysteryPony> MY GOD!
<Invi> the dude is simply the dude
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: i will pay you moneys to draw my oc

<Bronysith> EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is awesome
<Om> Lighsaber ponies?
<Bronysith> Om: thats my oc actually
<Bronysith> Om: a unicorn pony levitating a lightsaber
<GilDash> Bronysith: Someone took analysis of all the lightsaber battles in the first episode. Literally, there could be no deflection and the saber wouldn't have made contact anyway. It's all flashy stuff and not a proper fight.
<Om> The name makes sense now Bronysith
<Radu> You must new here be.
<Bronysith> GilDash: exactly. all bullshit
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oooh Wreky hasn't finished Rarity :'(
<Radu> How did you guys read that?
<Magical_pablez94> sorry...I forget to greet ya.... how's ya day been, GilDash ?
<GilDash> Bronysith: It's like demonstrative sparring as opposed to, say, a street fight.
<Meanwhile> Holy crap, this just in, lightsabres wouldn't work irl!
<Bronysith> Om: lol. actually would u like to read my fanfic. i based my oc around him
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: Not too bad. ;)
<Meanwhile> Go figure.
<Bronysith> GilDash: yea. its bullshit
<Sundaysmile> I hear the upbeat version of the Intermission theme?
<Bronysith> GilDash: i liked the fight betweent eh dark knight and the other guy better

<alexxm> hey Sundaysmile hows your day been

<PartyCannon> FOURTH WALL
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That spell was originally supposed to hit in the original design of the game to turn Banjo Kazooie into frogs and then I believe you had to play as Tootie in another quest to change them back.
<CCCP> IshBestPony: you are a mean pony!
