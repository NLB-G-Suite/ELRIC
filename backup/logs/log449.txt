<GilDash|EqD> WallDives: Hello! That would probably be me. :D
<GarrettBrony> I am Back baby
<GilDash|EqD> TrixieMuffin: :D
<Sylandest1> Lil_B: I like it! It has a light tune to it, very enjoyable
<GarrettBrony> whois streaming
*WallDives shrugs
<RustyMeat> Wrek
<Marx> Well, since I'm here, I'll share a dream I had last night. Part of it was me on Bronystate, and we were watching Code Lyoko. Maybe someone will actually stream that show someday?
<pony_4573> uh some guy mesaged me an told me to say, GilDash|EqD loves lazers?
<GilDash|EqD> pony_4573: Sorry about that. =_=
<GarrettBrony> Lazahs?
<pony_4573> Why?
<GilDash|EqD> OM! YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE!
<RustyMeat> Serj?
<crazypony> Marx: we streamed Code Lyoko yesterday
<Marx> :O
<Lil_B> Sylandest1 thanks, I like the piano, but right now i can't really do piano pieces because 100% of my inspirration comes from just playing it and so far i have no way to transfer this to the PC
<SirGanjalf> Ahh, good ol
<SirGanjalf> Good ol' Fresh Meat
<GarrettBrony> SirGanjalf the Brave
<WallDives> I used to be able to play the piano, a little. Kinda want to again.
<GarrettBrony> Good ol Fresh Prince
<Sylandest1> Lil_B: That's fine, no worries. Do you have any sort of media recording program or sound program?
<SirGanjalf> Sir Garrett the Brony:P
<Marx> That's the crazy thing about my dreams. Sometimes they show me a thing or two, and then one day it actually happens.
<crazypony> Marx: do you have pinkie sense?
<GarrettBrony> What game is this?
<GilDash|EqD> Marx: I know what you mean. I get deja vu from my dreams sometime too. :)
<WallDives> GarrettBrony: D3.
<GarrettBrony> Looks to dark to be D3
<Marx> Idk. I could. I think there was one dream I had where I saw the Gamecube logo even though it was a few years before the system actually came out.
<Marx> It was a long time ago, but yeah.
<Lil_B> Sylandest1 no, i hope i can get a MIDI keyboard soo, that would actual composing way easyer then clicking each not, and trying to get the right lenght and nots
<Sylandest1> GilDash|EqD: I get deja vu all the time when I'm out. I see something, walk by it, then come back and say "I've seen this before"
<VenHur96> Game looks good
<Marx> Welp, gotta go. Later guys.
<VenHur96> Bye Marx.
<Sylandest1> Lil_B: It sounds like you have a plan then! Work towards that so you can play more and make more good pieces like what you gave me! You will surely succeed :)
<GarrettBrony> i had a dream that Princess Celestia and Luna were in middle school and they were uneasy about their new found fame
<RustyMeat> dat jump
<WallDives> I dont think I've dreamed about ponies.
<Om> http://derpy.me/6CRoG
<GilDash|EqD> Sylandest1: Not like that. It's like a split second in time, sometimes a few seconds. I had one with Bronystate a few days ago, and everything seemed to match, right down to the text and the video playing.

<WallDives> ...?
<GarrettBrony> Lazah
<GilDash|EqD> Why? Why is Ommy trolling me? :'(
<WallDives> I dont get it.
<Chimera> Bai Lugia :u
<Lil_B> Sylandest1 hopefully, right now all i can do is not to stop or to let myself down. Only a fool would think that success is imidient
<necroshadow123> praise your pony overlords lol
<Sylandest1> GilDash|EqD: oh really? That's a pretty strong occurance
<GarrettBrony> GilDash|EqD: Wat about SonicRainbooms
<GilDash|EqD> GarrettBrony: Wait, what?
*GarrettBrony SonicRainbooms
<WallDives> precognitive dreams?
<GilDash|EqD> GarrettBrony: That's not how it works. :$
<Sylandest1> Lil_B: success is not always immediate, true. But it can be achieved if you keep trying. If you have the will to continue and persevere, then success will be found regardless of the length of time needed
<Scavender> good evening everypony
<GilDash|EqD> WallDives: I'd say so, but then I'd think I was mad. :D
<Wrek> 05well that was fun

*GilDash sits on Omlazerlicous's head.
<Kandarihu> I agree. That Spitfire turned out fantastically
*GilDash doesn't want to talk about stupid sexy Spitfire.
<Omlazerlicous> This isn't an RP chat you know~
<Sylandest1> GilDash: I'm quite aware of that, lol. And I can imagine several reasons why *notes the spitfire comment*
*Airpuff stares shocked at GilDash "Thats rare" =O

<LilB> EQD... right that sites does still exist... I need to read/ignore some articles right now
<GilDash> Airpuff: I'm not sure what would happen if I did...
<Airpuff> GilDash: Thats more like it.. xD
<Aylnine> WallDives, GilDash: I have a ton of work to do, my car is out of gas, my fridge is out of groceries, my copy of Illustrator doesn't work anymore because my boss decided it would be fun to install it even though he can't use it and I need it for homework, and I have a ginormous project I need to put my nose to the grindstone for for a week :'(
<Omlazerlicous> GilDash: Just passing down the law of RB64

<Airpuff> Aylnine: aaah... so much work..

<GilDash> Omlazerlicous: Your spelling is getting worse and worse Ommy. Soon you'll spell no as yes and I'll get all confused. ;)
<GilDash> Aylnine: Wow. That sucks ass.
<WallDives> Aylnine: I see. that is a rough week ahead. I sympathize, this week will be hell for me too...

<GilDash> Acleps: Please, don't encourage him. :|
<Omlazerlicous> You underestimate the power of lazers GilDash
<LilB> I think Drawfriedn is the only reason anymore why i visit EQD
<GilDash> Airpuff: Some silly filly thinks that it's a suitable substitute for "laser".
<Sylandest1> LilB: I know, its always so enjoyable to see
<Acleps> GilDash: That could work
<Airpuff> GilDash: ._. But...
<Omlazerlicous> Acleps: Thank you very much.
<GilDash> Omlazerlicous: You underestimate me, Om. You've no idea what I can be like...
<Omlazerlicous> GilDash: Aye, that is true. And yet. The lazerz, they call to me.
<GilDash> Acleps: What could work?
<Sylandest1> GilDash: now now, let's not be hasty! :$
<Airpuff> GilDash: ... If its... Lazer... why is .. it dosent fit with Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation? xD
<GilDash> Omlazerlicous: Well, I'll be calling to you if you're not careful. ;)

<Acleps> GilDash: Something?... I'm listening...
<GilDash> Acleps: Oh... you know... ;)
<Acleps> GilDash: No, not really :S

<Sylandest1> GilDash: *faceplant*

<Angel_Espeon> 13How difficult is it to find a PS3 with backwards compatibility these days?
<WallDives> hi pyrocatboy.
<Dken2021> hai pyrocatboy
<drfsupercenter> 03very
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Sylandest1> Airpuff: O//O wh-why did you? Never mind *scoots away*
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not only that
<Airpuff> hai pyrocatboy !
<alexxm> hey pyrocatboy hows your day been
<drfsupercenter> 03but it has to be older firmware so I can hack it
<drfsupercenter> 03there are only two on all of eBay that even fit that :|
<pyrocatboy> alexxm : meh
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, first generation (so it plays PS2 games) + not updated
<Airpuff> Om: oh yes you do. :)
<Acleps> Hi pyrocatboy! :)
<drfsupercenter> 03EVERYBODY UPDATES THEIR PS3s :|
<Om> Sylandest1: Are you new here by chance?
<alexxm> taking the mick out of old movies Acleps
<drfsupercenter> 03fricking ruins the value
<Dermathil> GilDash: Explicit is 18+ nonexplicit is mature. PG is NEITHER.
<GarrettBrony> Acleps: let this video explain http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcUkKltAidM
<Om> Airpuff: I don't.
<pyrocatboy> Whats streaming
<drfsupercenter> 03but if you don't care about hacking and playing free games, there are a few first-gen ones out there yeah
<Dken2021> the buffering cirlce
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah, cuz I know someone who's looking for a backwards compatible PS3 and he seems pretty determined to find one
<Dken2021> *cirlce
<Dken2021> eh
<drfsupercenter> 03how much would he pay
*drfsupercenter runs
<Dermathil> GilDash: seriously people have been permabanned for that kind of stuff.
<GilDash> Dermathil: Depends on the terminology used. I've seen more than a few raunchy things in PG films. :)
<drfsupercenter> 03No I'm serious, I have a spare
<Angel_Espeon> 13even though I warned him it's be difficult to find one xD
<drfsupercenter> 03well "spare"
<Angel_Espeon> 13*it'd
<Airpuff> xD Om, sometimes.. youre just awkwardly dumb. Cute ;)
<Sylandest1> Om: nay, been here a little while. I'm aware of the rules
<drfsupercenter> 03basically I was stupid and accidentally updated it
<drfsupercenter> 03so no hacks
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Jim> Ohai everypony
<Angel_Espeon> 13how much would you sell it for :P
<Dken2021> hai Jim
<drfsupercenter> 03around $200
<GilDash> Dermathil: 'Sides that, I'm silent when a mod instructs it.
<Airpuff> Hai Jim !
<WallDives> hi Jim.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I just paid for the new one
<Dermathil> GilDash, I know the terminology used on Bronystate. And for the chat SAUCY is NOT OKAY
<alexxm> hey Jim hows your day been
<GarrettBrony> hes dead Jiim
<Om> Sylandest1: Its not the rules I am woried about. You see, they don't know when to stop.
<drfsupercenter> 03well "new", you get the idea XD
<Jim> My day's been pretty alright
<Om> Airpuff: Don't call me that.

*Airpuff gives Dermathil a chillpill
<GilDash> Dermathil: If we're going to discuss the rules, then don't backseat mod. :p
<Airpuff> Om: Owkai then :)
<GarrettBrony> BAT CREDIT CARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDD
<Sylandest1> Om: oh, that. I'm aware of that, lol. I've seen GilDash at it before
<Angel_Espeon> 13well he's been on a games/consoles spending spree lately and won't listen to me when I say he should SAVE the money
<Angel_Espeon> 13so that price is probably fine xD
<Airpuff> GarrettBrony: Where?!
*CrazyCherry gives GilDash some carrot juice.
<Dermathil> GilDash: then start acting accordingly.
<GilDash> Om: Yeah. I know when to stop. Just as the mod hovers a finger over the kick button... :D
<Acleps> GarrettBrony: I'm more confused than ever :S
<crazypony> pyrocatboy:i want that credit card
<Airpuff> GilDash: That works fine. xD
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm assuming he's in the UK?
<Sylandest1> GilDash: and even then, you hardly lose motivation...lol
<Om> Sylandest1: Right, have fun then.
<GarrettBrony> Somepony Linked to a Picture of a bat credit card
<Dermathil> You don't know when to really stop.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13> Paypal
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<GilDash> Sylandest1: Well, I just keep it on the back-burner. ;)
<Om> GilDash: Yes, that is when you stop >.>
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know if PS3 games are region protected
<drfsupercenter> 03but mine's a USA console
<Om> in this chat
<drfsupercenter> 03if that means anything
<pyrocatboy> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-feel-the-power-of-love-and-tolerance.jpg
<Jim> This game is just so great http://derpy.me/Qa6OB
<GilDash> Om: Just. It's still there in my head when things calm down though. ;)
<Kandarihu> So, did Val stream anything good after the mindrape last night?
<bluesun> well
<Acleps> pyocatboy: :D
<bluesun> PS3 games aren't, PS1/2 games are
<drfsupercenter> 03are they?
<Lurking_WallDives> Kandarihu: am I the only one who thought that audio screw ups were hilarious?
<GarrettBrony> In the not to distant future next sunday A.D
<drfsupercenter> 03can an American PS3 play UK PS2 then or no?
<bluesun> nope :\
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03so it would basically defeat the point of backwards compatibility LOL
<pyrocatboy> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0u3v2dCn41rpfifpo1_500.png
<Sylandest1> GilDash: well, at least cherry is here to keep you under control...for the most part...lol
<GarrettBrony> There was a pony named joel, not to different from you or me
<Angel_Espeon> 13apparently PS3 games are region free
<bluesun> well he could always import :p
<Om> GilDash: With so little in the chat today, I worry for the sanity of others and myself
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what bluesun just said
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah, but that seems dumb
<Angel_Espeon> 13what I've always wanted to know is WHY WOULD THEY GET RID OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY TO BEGIN WITH
<Jim> dat fluttershy pyrocatboy :3
<drfsupercenter> 03because they're SOny
<drfsupercenter> 03and they're idiots.
<drfsupercenter> 03that, and money
<Airpuff> Damn pyrocatboy thats adorable *-*
<GarrettBrony> La La LA
<drfsupercenter> 03now, why did they get rid of the emulation that second-gen PS3s had? No idea, probably because they're idiots
<GarrettBrony> Mitchell!
<drfsupercenter> 03but the first-gen ones actually cost a crap ton of money to make xD
<Airpuff> Om you're always worried about your sanity :P
<Om> Airpuff: It slips far to easily.
<GarrettBrony> Avenger r u toxic
<WallDives> Sanity is overrated...and insanity is boring.
<bluesun> apparently when they abandoned it they had something like 500+ PS2 games that needed to be Special Cased for the PS3 and even more being discovered as time went on
<Jim> Welcome to Bronystate, please leave your sanity at hte designated sanity disposal containers at the doors.
<Jim> the*
<Airpuff> Om: maybe i can massage it back into you? ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03er wait
<drfsupercenter> 03special cased?
<GarrettBrony> I like to call it Mental Entertainment
<Sylandest1> Airpuff: GilDash has rubbed off on you...lol
<bluesun> different internal emulator options
<Airpuff> Sylandest1: i know.. xD
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Om> Airpuff: Or, you can do nothing and let it teeter like it should.
<drfsupercenter> 03that only applies to the second-gen ones then, right?
<Airpuff> Om: what if you loose your sanity then?
<pyrocatboy> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0u3v2dCn41rpfifpo2_500.png
<bluesun> not sure, but that would make sense
<Airpuff> Om i would have no one to punish me if i go too far ;)
<Airpuff> xD
<Om> Airpuff: We taling real or hypothetical >.>
<Dken2021> but it's summer pyrocatboy
<CrazyCherry> GilDash: Hellooo? *waves hoof in front of GilDash's eyes*
<Om> talking*
<Airpuff> goddammit pyrocatboy ... *-*
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't quite get why they named the hardware emulator "emotion engine" :P
<drfsupercenter> 03makes it sound fancier than it actually is XD
<Sylandest1> CrazyCherry: perhaps Gil is rebooting?
<GarrettBrony> Robot Roll Call
<Jim> pyrocatboy: Hnnnnngggh
<GarrettBrony> Cambot
<Airpuff> Om up to you.. to decide that :)
<alexxm> gypsy
<GarrettBrony> Tom Servo

<Om> WallDives: You can be charged with asisted suicide I think
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Goodafternoon everyone
<WallDives> Om: that depends per state. coersion to suicide isnt a charge in many states...
<Jim> Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<icybeauti> Hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT

<Rain> what's up, Wrek? ^_^
<Soital> 12Personally I won't fall for some really old man or some really young kid
<Princess_Molestia> GarrettBrony: Wrek is of course
*pyrocatboy noms on Om
<Malavolent> Needs more Twilight.
<Jim> GarrettBrony: I'm guessing Wrek
<Sylandest> Princess_Molestia: O.o w-what for?
<Princess_Molestia> GarrettBrony: now come here a minute
<Kammerjunk> GarrettBrony: Judging by the Twilight, I'd say Wrek.
<Princess_Molestia> Sylandest: what do u think
<Wrek> 05hehe saturn :3
<Soital> 12but if others both actually want to be together and legally aged
<Soital> 12wynaut
<Princess_Molestia> come here Wrek
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
*Princess_Molestia hugs Wrek
<GarrettBrony> Wrek Play the one about falling down the stars
<Skydroid> 12 year old and 20 year old
<Skydroid> I mean something's wrong with that
<Skydroid> It would be diff if 12 year old was older
<Skydroid> Likw
<Skydroid> 20 and 28
<Skydroid> Anyway, drf
<Wrek> 05jsut takign it smooth with some good music, twilight and i dunno
<Skydroid> Age range, well
<drfsupercenter> 03wowla
<GilDash> Om: You're never safe while I'm around. I might just hide and wait for a phrase to twist, but I'm never gone. ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03g
<Rain> haha
<Jim> nice plan
<Princess_Molestia> Wrek: threesome with me and Saturn ?
<Soital> 12yeah 12 is underaged
<Sylandest> Princess_Molestia: Judging by your name, I can imagine...lol
<Soital> 12I mean if its legal
<Soital> 12which is 16 over here
<drfsupercenter> 0316 is here too
<Sylandest> GilDash: lurking like a boss?
<drfsupercenter> 03which is my point LOL
<Om> GilDash: I've noticed. -_-;
<GilDash> Princess_Molestia: Think you can handle another? ;)
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash:...(just wants to ping you)
<drfsupercenter> 03but I think most people would still consider you a pedo if they're "minors", or under 18
<Princess_Molestia> MORE ORGY GilDash of course
<Malavolent> This is getting weird real fast...
*Litwick flies off.
<WallDives> wow, and to think this is PG.
<FlareChaser> hey kids
<Kandarihu> I guess it's true. Twilight Sparkle's cutie mark DOES have 42 points on it.
*Princess_Molestia glomps Litwick
<alexxm> play with her arse GilDash
<Skydroid> Tbh I'm saying 16 for now because generally people shouldn't be dating below that age anyway, otherwise lol preteens
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: what about me
<GilDash> Sylandest: Nah, just in a debate and taking any opportunity. ;)
<FlareChaser> Guys, I got something to say:
<FlareChaser> ahem
<Wrek> 05you wouldnt even last the first 4 hours molestia
<Sylandest> GilDash: what is being debated?
<Om> WallDives: Almost never I'm affraid.
<Skydroid> they're immature anyway
<GilDash> alexxm: Thanks for the advice. ;)
<Malavolent> I'm not against roleplay but there are kids here guys.
<FlareChaser> I read Molestia.
<Princess_Molestia> Wrek: is that a test?
<Tovler|Twibfm> I was wondering where that noise was coming from *closes BS window*
<Jim> Kandarihu: Does that mean that Twilight Sparkle is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?
<alexxm> hey FlareChaser what have you been up to
<drfsupercenter> 03some older people are immature
*drfsupercenter runs
<Soital> 12pretty much
<VioletGreySha> all the orgy omg ö_ö
<FlareChaser> alexxm: nothing :3
<Skydroid> and above my age, I'd say 22 or so
<FlareChaser> I read ALLLLL of Molestia.
<GilDash> Sylandest: Fricking quantum physics and philosophy. -_-
<Wrek> 05no its a cup of tea :3
<FlareChaser> it was...eh.
<Litwick> TRUST ME MOLESTIA. YOU DON'T WANT WREK.
<drfsupercenter> 02[I am 0321.166133 02years old]
<drfsupercenter> 03OK cool
<Princess_Molestia> Wrek: dat be challenge? cause i like a good challenge!
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<Magical_pablez94> Malavolent: ....kids are not as innocent as u think.
<Magical_pablez94> :D
<Skydroid> Ofc my parents wouldn't like that
<Om> GilDash: The best stuff eva!
<Sylandest> GilDash: I would never expect that, lol. I've got nothing to contribute there
<Malavolent> Magical_pablez94: Noone is.
<FlareChaser> Molestia x Wrek? what?
<pyrocatboy> MI MOM!
<Kriel_Pony> FlareChaser: Me Too
*Princess_Molestia kisses Wrek
<Skydroid> They would want someone no older than one or two years
<GilDash> Sylandest: It's sooo boring... >_<
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Soital> 12Holy carp it just struck me I'm 20 this year
<Bronysith> um Princess_Molestia Wrek s heart belongs to twilight
<Om> Sylandest: Its hurts GilDash wittle mind
<Skydroid> I have no.idea their stance on someone younger than me
<Chimera> hihi
<drfsupercenter> 03you remind me of a bash quote Soital
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll say in PM :P
<Chimera> Soital ur old DDDDDDDDDDD:
<Magical_pablez94> FlareChaser: eeyep... are they so cuute~??
<Skydroid> I'm not about to ask
<Sylandest> GilDash: lol, then stop debating it and do something fun! :)
<GilDash> Sylandest: Yet I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame.
<Chimera> :P
<Princess_Molestia> Bronysith: she can get in on it too
<GilDash> Sylandest: Is that an offer? ;)
<Soital> 12I don't look 20 ;__;
<Rain> Shizuka, are you up for playing a game or something? :3
<Shizuka> 13i am making a song~
<Magical_pablez94> FlareChaser: aren't*
<Kandarihu> It's just an homage to the franchise. In the canon of the book, 42 wasn't REALLY the meaning to Life, the Universe and Everything. It's just a pointless response Deep Thought conjured up after 7,000,000 years of waiting for the perfect question.
<Rain> :o
*Litwick paints blue everywhere
<Bronysith> hey Shizuka whats up
<Rain> Epic, Shizuka. :3
<Jim> That's cool
<Soital> 12I wonder if I could get away with going in wacky warehouse
<Skydroid> I look 20
<Litwick> I BROKE THE RULES
<Skydroid> DJ
<Soital> 12I missed that play area
<Sylandest> GilDash: O///O w-what? no!
<Skydroid> D:
*GilDash kisses Sylandest.
<Shizuka> 13well sort of making a song... more like remaking the piano song from the new intermission so it's higher quality
<Princess_Molestia> Litwick: you should be punished... prepare it
<Om> Sylandest: Not so fun is it?
<Rain> :3
<GilDash> Sylandest: Yes it was. ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL really?
<Litwick> How about no Princess_Molestia.
*Sylandest blushes red as fire
<Skydroid> That reminds me
<Jim> New intermission?
<Princess_Molestia> Litwick: too bad
<FlareChaser> whats Wreky drawing now? :P
<Sylandest> Om: I was just trying to help...XD
<Vordox> Wrek, continuing oin yur Spitfire Challenge?
<Rain> guys, seriously, RPing is against the rules. Take it to another room or to a PM >_>
<Skydroid> I picked up a job application the other day
<SilverSonic> You all look the same to me
<Skydroid> The lady was like
<Litwick> D:
<Skydroid> "Aren't you a little old to work here?"
<Soital> 12except I have a cow on my head
<Soital> 12a chibi cow
<Om> Sylandest: GilDash doesn't need help. Words of advice.
<GilDash> Rain: The mods can handle themselves. :)
<Soital> 12named Moo
<Skydroid> I said I was only.17
<drfsupercenter> 03pix or gtfo?
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Malavolent> Rain: What do you know, maybe it's happening for real? In that case it's not against the rules.
<Sylandest> Om: duly noted...lol

*SilverSonic hides

<Kriel_Pony> FlareChaser: as a doctor (I am not a doctor) I believe that the most effective cure for any case of sever boredom is 10 ccs of video games. Can't measure video games in ccs? Well, just keep playing until that pesky boredom clears up.
<sharklion> I'm about to fall asleep because of tiredness....

<Dan> good question Invi
<sharklion> alexxm: do we want to inhabit a cold, wet polish village?
<Biglaw> FlareChaser people have limits
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: It is the price to pay to live in Brony
<alexxm> do you want to live in a village called brony sharklion besides i'm english i've seen worse
<Invi> Dan and i am not sure if i want to know that, now when I'm thinking about it...
<Biglaw> FlareChaser I just want a break today. Sorry for outbursting.
<sharklion> alexxm: same. Attention bronies! we ride at midnight for Poland! to the village of Brony!
<Dan> Invi:we're talking about a land where they produce infinite muffins
<Dan> INFINITE-MUFFINS
<Biglaw> Dan Derpy Paradise
<alexxm> where in england are you sharklion
<WallDives> wouldnt that make muffins worthless?
<Dan> le gasp!
<Chrysalis> sharklion: UK?
<sharklion> WallDives: muffins will never be worhtless
<Biglaw> It would make them bountiful
<Invi> Dan but... physical laws...
<Biglaw> not worthles
<sharklion> Chrysalis: I live in UK yes.
<alexxm> since when were muffins a currency WallDives
<Chrysalis> sharklion: you going to BUCK?
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: Really? Invading poland?
<alexxm> where in england are you sharklion
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: for the town of Brony
<Dan> pfft, forget physical laws, it's all theories
<Dan> like gravity
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Invading Poland?! Thats an original idea
<sharklion> alexxm: Gloucestershire
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: No, I get it, just... Invading poland...
<WallDives> oh.
<alexxm> Kriel_Pony http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship
<WallDives> OH.
<sharklion> Chrysalis: whith who? alexxm? am I going to buck alexxm?
<RainbowAsh> Hiya
<WallDives> I see how that came out wrong.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> eya RainbowAsh
<Kriel_Pony> alexxm: No, I saw, I understand the town, I;m jsut saying invading poland doesnt end well.
<RainbowAsh> Hi OmegaMetroidBrony
<BoredFaicJenkins> Swag Spike ftw.
<alexxm> hey RainbowAsh hows your day been
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: It's only invading 80 people/
<sharklion> not all of poland
<sharklion> just Brony
<Invi> Dan but... argh... ok, physical laws may or may not exsist ;A;
<Invi> hio OmegaMetroidBrony
<Chrysalis> sharklion: dont need to go with anyone, make friends there :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Invi *hugs* :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337626357914.jpg
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: I suppose. Of course, we ARE an international force so they wouldnt know WHO was invading.
<Chrysalis> we even got Wrek getting flown over as a guest of honour
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait here a minute
<alexxm> hey OmegaMetroidBrony hows your day been
*Invi hugwubbles OmegaMetroidBrony back :3
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, long and exhausting, but a mug of soy milk with maple sirup just now made it all good again. ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> force? invading?
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: news just in. Every country invades Poland
<Wrek> 05and ofc my darkest days to make this image as uncomfortable as possiboru
<Dan> Invi: if physical laws existed, then how do you explain the lifetime muffins I just won hmmm?:P
<alexxm> CrimsonPhoenix http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Good alexxm nearly aquired severe injury
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You?
<Chrysalis> Wrek: llove My Darkest Days, thanks for introducing me to them
<Kandarihu> CrimsonPhoenix: Wow. That makes TOO much sense
<panda> Wrek: well... nothing makes me uncomfortable ^^
<Rain> Wrek, I love it when you make things uncomfortable :3
<alexxm> how OmegaMetroidBrony i'm good did some filming today
<Chrysalis> Rain: thats what she said
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: Thats my point. Everyone invades poland, but poland is still it's own country, so none of them WIN
<RainbowAsh> Invi, why shouldn't physical laws exist?
<Invi> RainbowAsh because you can't prof them really, because prooving things 100% isn't possible
<Invi> *proof
<CCCP> hello everypony
<Invi> hio CCCP
<Dan> RainbowAsh: because I just won a lifetime of something by being the 999,999th visitor
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai CCCP
<alexxm> hey CCCP hows your day been
<WallDives> hi CCCP.
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: It's becasue Poland trancends all laws of war and wins no matter what happens. Also, it's a miniscule amount of Poland. Everyone in the chat could invade Poland.
<CCCP> hi Invi OmegaMetroidBrony alexxm and WallDives
<sharklion> hi CCCP
<alexxm> CCCP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship we ride at dawn for Brony
<Invi> RainbowAsh and DAN is a counterexample for physical laws
<CCCP> alexxm: its been good, you?
<RainbowAsh> Dan: Congratulations, that's awesome.
<Golakka> Hello sexy people
<CCCP> hi sharklion
<alexxm> good CCCP done some filming today
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Golakka
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: Why don't we just start our OWN crappy village and CALL it Brony?
<sharklion> sup Golakka
<CCCP> alexxm: LOL
<Golakka> whats wrekky up to today? who is he drawing?
<alexxm> hey Golakka hows your day been

<alexxm> a movie for my college course CCCP
<Dan> but there are only 2 ways to prove something 100%
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: That requires more work! we have to all buy materials and stuff. It's easier to go to poland and take over with sheer power of men with sticks
<Dan> either mathematically or by logical necessity
<Invi> Dan no, there is no way
<Chrysalis> god i love being ComSci http://imgur.com/lwWeu
<CCCP> alexxm: cool :) whats it about?
<CCCP> hi Golakka
<sharklion> why is always us alexxm who start the wars?
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: But, I think if we took the town, the rest of poland may take offense.
<Chrysalis> quad 1080p monitors :D
<RainbowAsh> Invi, that implies a very restrictive definition of "proof". Also prooving laws is not how science works, they gather evidence and seek counter-examples in order to make a case for or against a hypothesis.
<alexxm> a stalker CCCP
*VioletGreySha glomps invi
*Golakka sexes cccp non sexually
<alexxm> what sharklion
<CCCP> Golakka: :3
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: we could all move in slowly. then, one day, everyone there would be a brony
<Dan> Invi: yes :) for example, 2 + 2 will always equal 4

<Golakka> Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!!
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: the peaceful way to remove people from their homes
<alexxm> what do we do with the 80 people already there sharklion
<Invi> Dan RainbowAsh there are only 2 things that are sure, the rest can be made up (like in Matrix) or not :3
<Kriel_Pony> alexxm: We play MLP all day. They will convert or flee.
<Dan> what 2 things, Invi
<Dan> ?
<WallDives> or shut electricity off to the village.
<alexxm> so we weaponize G3 Kriel_Pony
<Kriel_Pony> alexxm: Basically. psychological warfare.
<sharklion> alexxm: subtle migration. The original 80 people will either become bronies or move without knowing what happened to the village and why it became so big
<panda> hey alexxm, ping meh if you need meh XD

*OmegaMetroidBrony is not good at the maths
<Invi> RainbowAsh touchè ;)
<Kriel_Pony> FlareChaser: the Brony Invasion Plan needs your support! Every able body counts!
<Dken2021> can't complain
<Shamroc> ..what the hecks?
*SonicTheStallion Lifts and throws nuke into chat room, trots away quickly
<FlareChaser> We need drunk flare now.
<FlareChaser> brb
<alexxm> do it FlaeChaser and you'll be mayor
<sharklion> SonicTheStallion: save the nukes for the invasion!
*Invi grabs SonicTheStallion and pulls him back into the resulting fallout
<Kriel_Pony> Wasting wartime supplies... just shameful!
<alexxm> do it FlareChaser and you'll be mayor
*Invi gives some pickles to FlareChaser
<SonicTheStallion> It's not gonna blow, it's just a nuke that was never activated
<SonicTheStallion> laters~
<sharklion> it's dangerous to go alone, take these pickles
<FlareChaser> alexxm: alright fine, what do?
<alexxm> we invade Brony and make it our own
*Invi hits the nuke with SonicTheStallion until it explodes
<sharklion> FlareChaser: we all slowly migrate into Brony. to avoid outright conflict
*FlareChaser charges into Brony
<FlareChaser> done.
<sharklion> then when everyone is there.... Brony belongs to Bronies!
<Invi> alexxm no: we invade the country, call it equestria and keep the capital city Brony ^^
<Sylandest> Invi: I like your thinking
<Dan> question, do all the "theaters" stream the same thing when there is only 1 streamer?
<Kriel_Pony> Invi: We start small, just the town.
<sharklion> Invi: Brony is a very small place
<sharklion> easy to invade unnoticed
<alexxm> only 80 people Invi
<OmegaMetroidBrony> There is only one stream Dan so yesh
<Invi> ok; we invade Brony and we use it as our base to overrun the rest of the country
<RainbowAsh> Dan: The theaters always show the same thing. They are just there, because during the new pony episodes each one is linked to a chatroom of their own to avoid crowding.
<panda> Om: ^^
<alexxm> do you know what country we're invading Invi
<Om> panda: Hmm?
<sharklion> Brony will be our landing point. we can fly in reinforcements from the rest of the world
*panda licks Om :D

<sharklion> WallDives: :D
<Invi> DerpStar as far as i know they don't like the term Pegasister
<DerpStar> ^^
<FlareChaser|GMod> My friend is a Brony, but he HATES rarity, what do?
<Kriel_Pony> Dan: Unfortunate typo. very different meaning
<WallDives> at least i'm honest with myself.
<Dan> haha
<howdyx> wow
<Dan> how can you hate rarity?
<Invi> FlareChaser|GMod tell him hating is against the love and tolerance thing
<howdyx> drawing is magic yay
<Dan> he**
<panda> Om: oh :D well., thank you
<Chrysalis> its open all night as well
<DerpStar> Many people don't like Rarity FlareChaser|GMod
<Om> panda: Uh huh.
<panda> Dan: who hates RARITY!:[
<Dan> I love rarity, her voice actor is amazing
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Bronies love and tolerate?
<howdyx> yep
<Invi> ^
<Kriel_Pony> FlareChaser|GMod: clearly get him medical help.
<RaveBrony> Hey everypony!! :)
<FlareChaser|GMod> guys guys
<Dan> lol hi panda
<Kammerjunk> FlareChaser|GMod: Tell me about it. My brony friend hates Fluttershy.
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Oh hai RaveBrony
<sharklion> I don't use the whole "love and tolerate" becasue this fandom has turned a bit ugly recently.
<CCCP> hi RaveBrony
<FlareChaser|GMod> RaveBrony! my cousin!
<panda> hiya RaveBrony
<sharklion> supe RaveBrony
<alexxm> hey RaveBrony hows your day been http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship we ride at dawn
<Invi> sharklion what? why?
<ZetaMetroidBrony> I didn't know about the "Love and Tolerate" till I came to Bronystate
<Invi> moin RaveBrony
<panda|animating> ZetaMetroidBrony: really?
<Kriel_Pony> ZetaMetroidBrony: Really? It is kinda... all over
*RaveBrony waves to ZetaMetroidBrony, CCCP, FlareChaser|GMod, sharklion, alexxm, and Invi
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Do I look like a /b/ronie to you?
<WallDives> love is overrated (read: worthless), tolerance will actually get you somewhere.
<CCCP> ZetaMetroidBrony: yes you do
<sharklion> Invi: there are certain people (not the majority, but loud) that just sometimes makes me hate what the fandom has become or may be becoming
<ZetaMetroidBrony> No I am not
<alexxm> love is ambitous but rubbish
<FlareChaser|GMod> RaveBrony: we need more Octavia x Me, what do? beg? DO I YELL AT SOMEONE!?
<Invi> ZetaMetroidBrony but it is on nearly every pony relatet webpage
<FillyFlam> This chat seems depressing.
<FillyFlam> We must remedy this.,
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Who said I go to pony webpages?
<ZetaMetroidBrony> :P
<panda|animating> FillyFlam: hm? how so
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: Well, yes, but negative people will always be involved in anything.
<DerpStar> Invi can I be an honourany Brony then?
<alexxm> hey FillyFlam hows your day been
<alexxm> when we invade DerpStar
<ZetaMetroidBrony> Dat invasion
<Invi> DerpStar aks Lauren faust ^^
<DerpStar> Ok cause if there isn't a Pegasister square or something
<FillyFlam> panda|animating: I come in and people are all LOVE IS AWFUL and talking about being concerned for the fandom.
<FillyFlam> Also hi alexxm, my day's ben great, thanks. :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Finally got this nick back
<WallDives> also, hi FillyFlam.
<panda|animating> FillyFlam: oh, you walked in at the wrong time ^^
<Dan> I wonder why nopony finds spike's crush on rarity even a little taboo
<Invi> sharklion i know what you mean, you don't need to love them, just tolerate.
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: I know. and spending time in here has certainly made me more enthusiastic about it again (I haven't been in in a while) but i've known blogs or people to stop doing what they do because of certain bronies.can't be helped but has been increasing in frequency as it growns
<sharklion> Invi: indeed
<WallDives> please note, I am a cynical, bitter person whose opinions in general should be ignored.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Inb4 the epic brony downfall
<Soital> 12give me a ticket to disney world
<sharklion> Dan: Spike is a baby! it's pedophilia!
<Soital> 12ALL THAT POKEMON STUFF
<Kriel_Pony> sharklion: More people creates more problems, it's just a fact, but the only way to really counteract it is not to combat the bad but to support the good.
<FillyFlam> ^
<Invi> sharklion i would interpret love and tolerance as: what you don't love, tolerate.
<howdyx> Rarity friendzoned SPike :(
<twilight_sprinkler> Kriel_Pony: solution:kill everyone.
<sharklion> Kriel_Pony: and I hope I do that and I hope people keep doing that.
<FillyFlam> TBH there are crazy idiots in every single group on Earth.
<Dan> sharklion: It's more than that, they're not even the same species
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I thought everyone was a crazy idiot :P
<FillyFlam> But it dosen't really do any good to fret about it. Just ignore them, I say.
<alexxm> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship FillyFlam we ride at dawn

<Dark_Horst> and i dare say that i fell positively in love with it'S shotguns
<nickstr> its from a tape deck through a home built audio attenuation cable
<Acleps|Sleepy> panda|animating: I never kenw you knew how to animate :O
<Meanwhile> Angry incoherant singing, art, and Twilight sparkle. My extreme powers of deduction tell me Wrek is streaming.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi everyone
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<Invi> hio HatsuneMikuFan
<panda|animating> Acleps|Sleepy: I dont ^^
<WallDives> Meanwhile: you would be correct.
<drfsupercenter> 03attenuation?
<Jim> hai Meanwhile and HatsuneMikuFan
<Invi> moin Meanwhile
<sharklion> Meanwhile: WITCH!
<WallDives> also, hi HatsuneMikuFan.
<Wrek> 05WE FOUND A WITCH, MAY BE BURN HER?
<Meanwhile> Lies. I weigh more than a duck.
<Acleps|Sleepy> panda|animating: So you're still practising?
<nickstr> basically its to lower voltage levels
<sharklion> BURN THE WITHC!
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: oh, i'm sure it's very coherent... if you speak the language, that is
<nickstr> to connect line level devices to microphone inputs
<Jim> Wrek: Does she float?
<panda|animating> Acleps|Sleepy: well, yeah
<RaveBrony> ^
<Meanwhile> I imagine so Dark_Horst.
<WallDives> Meanwhile: but you MUST be made of wood.
<Bronysith> Wrek: but of course
<nickstr> if you don't do this the results will be severe distortion
<Chrysalis> Wrek: how do you know she is a witch
<sharklion> ohai jim
<nickstr> no matter how low you set the levels
<Jim> Ohai :)
<Wrek> 05she turned me into a newt
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: she turned me into a newt
<Litwick> Meanwhile is heavier than the duck though. By like half an ounce. TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES CHEATER
<Chrysalis> really?
<Bronysith> DAMN IT Wrek
<Wrek> 05...i got better
<Jim> You don't look like a newt Wrek
<Acleps|Sleepy> panda|animating: How long have you been animating for?
<RaveBrony> ^
<Meanwhile> No.
<Meanwhile> >_>
<Meanwhile> <_<
<Shamroc> oh hai Meanwhile
<Dan> I'm back :) can anypony recommend me a mlp website with a good forum?
<Wrek> 05MakerDusk: thoughts so far?
<CCCP> ohai Meanwhile
<panda|animating> Acleps|Sleepy: well... ive only done simple stuff like stick figures, but im doing poni for the first time ^^
<sharklion> Dan: why would you need anywhere else but this place!
<Dark_Horst> Dan: ponibooru.org
<CCCP> sharklion: ikr
<Meanwhile> Ponibooru has a forum?
<Acleps|Sleepy> panda|animating: Sounds awesome! :)
<Dan> sharklion: as much as I like this place, I also like forum pages
<Invi> panda|animating stick poniez?
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: nope. that'S the jpoke. but psssst
<panda|animating> Acleps|Sleepy: :D i know right?
<Meanwhile> Oooooh.
<sharklion> Dan, I am dissapoint. :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn Boss eye doors
<panda|animating> Invi: no... its challenging because Ive never done anything with actual depth before XD
<Dark_Horst> but i found the most amazing discussions there, believe me
<nickstr> attenuation refers to lowering voltage levels in electronics
<CCCP> dat eye
<Dark_Horst> perfectly enjoyable with a bucket of popcorn
<Dan> cause I can leave discussions open for everyon to see, unlike live chat rooms where a discussion will end in under a minute or two
<sharklion> I read popcorn differently
<Invi> panda|animating oh lol show me the result when available ^^
<Dan> I like live chats and forums :)
<Dark_Horst> Dan: ponbooru. it has comment-sections with pictures!
<Meanwhile> I like ponies.
<Invi> sharklion you are supposed to eat popcorn, not to read them
<panda|animating> Invi: well.. I'm hoping that Sumica will stream it, well... since its for him ^^
<Dark_Horst> Dan: and wonderfully civilized people!
<sharklion> Meanwhile: what are you? A girl?
<Meanwhile> I think that counts as trolling Dark_Horst.
<Acleps|Sleepy> Meanwhile: I would gave never guessed! :D
<Invi> panda|animating nice, when I miss it, link it ^^
<deadeagle> sharklion: XD
<sharklion> Invi: dammit!
<Invi> :P
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: or does it? it makes me smile every day B)
<Dan> okay, thanks Dark_Horst :)
<panda|animating> Invi: for sure... I should have about 5 seconds of it done by the end of the week, hopefully my situation doesnt get worse ^^
<Meanwhile> Implying that ponibooru isn't a wretched hive of scum and villainy.
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: well, there'S always 4chan
<WallDives> ponibooru? Wreched hive of scum? no...
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah.
<sharklion> oh? you're going to ponibooru? why not go through /b/ while you're on the way?
<Dan> lol is ponibooru anything like /b/..?
<panda|animating> Wrek: this is infected mushroom right?
<WallDives> seriosuly, /b/ isnt THAT bad al the time.
<Dark_Horst> Dan: you don
<Invi> sharklion... R1...
<nickstr> this cable is only needed for certain things
<Dark_Horst> Dan: you don't know ponibooru? i amn disappoint
<Meanwhile> 4chan is like if you took a wretched hive of scum and villainy and then set it on fire, put the fire out, let it simmer for an hour, then populated the remains with orphans who have spent their whole lives in the wild.
<Dan> I'm a new brony D:
<nickstr> when recording from turntables it might or might not be necessary depending on the setup
<deadeagle> ponies suck
<sharklion> Dan: and we love you all the same
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Protip: When exiting Sector 4 (AQA) remember to lower the water level.
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile: apt description there
<nickstr> if the turntable has a built in preamp you will need one or if it has a ceramic cartridge
<sharklion> deadeagle: ponies are for fags!
<deadeagle> yeahhhh
<Dark_Horst> Dan: its an image-board. comment sections under the images. nice stuff happens there from time to time
<nickstr> ones with magnetic cartridges such as moving magnet or moving coil are roughly microphone level and work fine with a direct input
<Dark_Horst> Dan: and nom it'S not like 4chan...though sometimes i get the feeling some of them migrated there
<Dan> lol :$
<deadeagle> sharklion: go horses!
<sharklion> doesn't 4chan have it's own pony section?
<Acleps> Is this music Swedish :O?
<Meanwhile> deadeagle makes me think of Eaglebones Falconhawk.
<Acleps> sharklion: Yup :)
<Dan> yes, 4chan has its pony section
<sharklion> deadeagle: except shetland ponies. those are cool
<Dan> but those are image boards
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Protip: Don't swim in electrified water.
<sharklion> EAGLEPUUUUNCH!
<Dan> not forums
<deadeagle> you mean... PAWWNCH!
<sharklion> protip: when in doubt. whip it out.
<Dark_Horst> Dan: you should check it out. ponibooru.org. tons of nice art lands there. just.... don't click at the red and yellow boxes marked questionable or explicit if you're sensitive
<sharklion> EAGLE KIICK!
*Bronysith kicks sharklion
<Litwick> PENGUIN PUNCH
<Meanwhile> When somepony tries to block, show them your c-wait what?

<Claude> Doctor I asked my teacher if he was
*Invi grabs minigun
<Irish_Pony> Om HA! I have a secret door for just such an acoasion ;)
<ScootaChicken> There once was this guy who worked for the Railroad as a conductor. He was walking through the train, en route, collecting tickets from the passengers. He comes to car 12, booth 3. In it was a man. So, he asked him for his ticket: "Excuse me sir, do have your ticket?"
<ScootaChicken> "I'm terribly sorry sir, I must have dropped it out the window by accident," he replied.
<BaltoDork> Well alexxm he's been my friend for like 10 months and just when I start to think I'm almost there he dates this random chick he barely knows and starts ignoring me again.. I'll be fine in time, at least I'll get out in two weeks...
<ScootaChicken> "Sorry sir, we can't have any passengers without tickets." He grabbed the poor man by the scruff of the neck and threw him out of the train. Well, he landed on the tracks and was run over by the train. Naturally, the conductor was arrested and thrown in jail. He was convicted of murder before a jury of his peers, and sentenced to death by electrocution.
<Doctor> My gym teacher is one :3 Caught him watching it on his ipod
<Claude> becaude FiM theme is my ringtone alexxm
<Om> Irish_Pony: Is that so.
<Claude> my friend called me in class
<RX-78-SweetieBot> dammit jailbait
*alexxm hugs BaltoDork
*Om places berrel inside another berrel and nails it shut
<Doctor> I got a theme
<BaltoDork> =3 thanks alexxm.
<ScootaChicken> The day of his execution came up, and he was asked what he would like for his last meal. He asks for a banana. They gave it to him, he ate it, received his last rites, and was escorted to the chair. The executioner strapped him in, hooked everything up. Last, he threw the big switch once, and nothing happened. So, he did it again, and nothing happened. Well, by law the guy was legally dead,...
<ScootaChicken> ...so they had to release him.
<ScootaChicken> I'm gonna keep going ya know.
<Doctor> Join The Herd by Forest Rain
<Irish_Pony> Om and im not telling where because GilDash is in here with me, now if you'll excuse me *kisses GilDash *
<ScootaChicken> This goes one for a loooooooong time
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> need one more for campaing or 5 more for vs anyone wants to play ?
<ScootaChicken> Oddly enough, the guy got a job on another railroad, as a conductor! One day, he was gathering tickets, and came to a booth with a little boy.
<ScootaChicken> "Young man, do you have your ticket?", asked the conductor.
<Lil_B> I have a Picture with Alucard stroking Fluttershys mane... do i ut it into the ML or the castlevania Folde :( *First world Problems*
<Magical_pablez94> Litwick: hey calm down there!! what happened??

<BaltoDork> I'm going to watch Felidae with some friends on tinychat Friday to clear up my mind. it doesn't help that I'm probably going to have to talk to him really soon and act like everything
<BaltoDork> s normal.
*GilDash giggls at Irish_Pony.
<alexxm> Claude: someone in my media put the fluttershy how dare you in a film he did
<Claude> http://www.zerochan.net/515074 this is how I sleep
<Claude> alexxm That is cool
<Litwick> Magical_pablez94: Nothing happened. Forget about it.
*pyrocatboy looks adorable
<DuskStarshimmer> guys, can I just tell you, I make the most deleicous grillec chese sammiches ever
<Claude> alexxm I did an brand presentation in buisness on MLP FIM
<Doctor> I don't sleep...
<Kriel_Pony> DuskStarshimmer: I don't believe you.
<DuskStarshimmer> D:
<Doctor> My pony marathon is usually at night
<Doctor> :|
<Claude> I am the female claude faustus I am a demon and I wnat to eat your soul
<DuskStarshimmer> But But But, never ever for ever lie
<Invi> Claude is a demon?
<Chrysalis> and nothing
<Claude> Invi in anime yes
<Irish_Pony> GilDash: you did say you wanted Irish in you ;)
<ScootaChicken> "A-a-a, I'm sorry, I ate it by mistake..", said the little boy.
<ScootaChicken> And.. the same thing happened -- the boy was thrown off the train and killed . The guy was arrested, sentenced to death by electrocution. It came to him last day. The death row guard asked him what he would like for his meal. He asked for banana again. He ate it, and a priest gave him last rites.
<alexxm> i might do an article about bronies for my media class Claude and just tell people the articles about unexpected fan bases
<Claude> Invi http://kuroshitsuji.wikia.com/wiki/Claude_Faustus
<Litwick> Honestly after that, I feel legitamately pissed. Like I could punch someone in the face mad.
<Doctor> Claude are you a SPY?!
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: Yes, I did... ;)
<BaltoDork> ugh. loose laptop cord... ffffff
<Airpuff> Meep anypone got a way to save severely soaped eyes? >.<
<GilDash> Litwick: Dude, calm down. It's over now.
*Invi pokes Claude and backs of

<XAX> gday.
<Doctor> Prob...
<Magical_pablez94> Litwick: ok...just calm down then :) i'm here if u wanna talk about it ;)
<GilDash> Airpuff: Running water.
<Invi> hio again XAX
<Claude> Invi I dont want your soul silly filly
<ScootaChicken> He was escorted to the death chamber. This time, though, they were smart.
<ScootaChicken> They washed his hands to get rid of any banana slime, they washed up the chair.
<XAX|school> thats better >_>
*pyrocatboy meows
<ScootaChicken> Next, they placed him the chair, and hooked him up. The switch-puller pulled the switch once, and nothing happened. The switch-puller pulled the switch twice, and nothing happened, not even a single hair raising on the guy's chest, and as the law states, they had to let him go...
<Airpuff> GilDash: tryed that alredy ._. It still stings
<Claude> Invi I want Meanwhile's soul
<GilDash> Airpuff: Saline solution, if you have any.
<Doctor> Just like Zacora..Not sure if I'm spelling that right...
<Invi> Claude lol i don't even have a soul, silly :)
<Claude> Zecora
<StupidSexyCJ> DuskStarshimmer: o rly?
<ScootaChicken> Even more amazingly, he got a job on yet another railroad.
<Lil_B> well, it's 0:00 at night for me now, i gotta leave the chat now if i want to not-be-so-tired in school tomor... today
<Doctor> Still new to this land
<ScootaChicken> This time it was a rabbi. Same old stuff. The Rabbi had forgotten to buy his ticket, so he was thrown off the train, arrested, convicted, sentenced to death by electrocution etc etc.
<ScootaChicken> When the guard asked him what he would like for a last meal, he asked for a banana. He ate it, received last rites, and was escorted to the chamber.
<Airpuff> GilDash: Saline... solution? ô.o
<Claude> Invi let me taste your blood and see :)
*Midnight_Tempest noms on kirzstryfe
<Doctor> Okay..Thanks
<Claude> kehehehe
<Lil_B> bye
<Invi> bya Lil_B
<XAX|school> Lil_B: have a good sleep and such.
*Lil_B hugs ALL of the Chat
<ScootaChicken> However, this time the officials where going to get it right! They scrubbed his body with a brillo pad. They scrubbed the chair with steel wool. They tried the chair on a few other prisoners and it all worked! This time it was bound to succeed.
<ScootaChicken> So they strapped him in, and threw the switch once, nothing happened. Threw the switch a second time, nothing happened. At this point the guy was legally dead, etc, etc.
<alexxm> i'm going to do an article about bronies for my media class any ideas what to put in it
<GilDash> Airpuff: Okay, I'm going to assume you have none of that. :D Just keep up with running water, lukewarm preferably.
<Airpuff> me hugs Lil_B back
<alexxm> cya Lil_B
*Invi hugwubbles Lil_B
<Airpuff> GilDash: kai T.T
<ScootaChicken> But, before the man could leave, the executioner, extremely frustrated . asked, "What is it with the banana!"
<ScootaChicken> The man replied, "I just like bananas."
<GilDash> alexxm: Nothing that goes on here. :D
<ScootaChicken> So, the executioner screamed, "THEN HOW COME YOU DON'T DIE!!!!!"
<ScootaChicken> So the man responded 'I dunno'

<Prince_Lightboom> me of the day...left https://s.deviantart.com/th/fs71/f/2011/120/1/b/mlp__brohoof_by_shadowparade-d3faknf.png
<Cobellanez> I can honestly say, I dislike these types of songs. The lyrics I mean.
<nickstr> I think 2 channel stereo is fine for music
<superretroworld> TheHoodyNinja: we should have pirate days instead of maid days for now on
<nickstr> over all
<kirzstryfe> 1,3ew
<Biglaw> I liek maid hour though
<MahBoi777> nice Prince_Lightboom
<TheHoodyNinja> superretroworld: maid HOURS GET IT RIGHT FILLY!
<Chrysalis> yeah i know :(
<CupcakeWarrior> Cobellanez: I hate this particular song actually
<TheHoodyNinja> CupcakeWarrior: is it maroon five?
<Chrysalis> i basically finish uni at the end of this week
<Chrysalis> which is terrifying
<CupcakeWarrior> TheHoodyNinja: No, I love marron 5
<Prince_Lightboom> pic of the day https://s.deviantart.com/th/fs71/PRE/f/2012/066/7/3/vinyl_scratch_by_holyshmow-d4s1os7.png
<superretroworld> maid hour my bad
<Chrysalis> 4 years and god knows how much money
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Maid hour? already?
<TheHoodyNinja> Prince_Lightboom: seen it twenty time
<Chrysalis> and ill get a number at the end of it
<MahBoi777> Lol
<TheHoodyNinja> i like this song tho
<CupcakeWarrior> Its not maid hour yet
<junh1024-XD> sorta, it is the most common channel configuration
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Ew, Vinyl x Tavi.
<Prince_Lightboom> new entry
<TheHoodyNinja> FlareChaserxOctavia: Im sorry you gotta problem?
<FlareChaserxOctavia> TheHoodyNinja: Nah, just joking.
<nickstr> its because what is the point of multichannel sound in music
<junh1024-XD> 7.1fr, 9.1, 10.2, 11.1, and 22.2 standards have 5 or more front speakers.
<Prince_Lightboom> clop of the day... https://s.deviantart.com/th/fs71/PRE/f/2012/067/7/3/mlp__contest_entry_by_boorat-d4s5lyp.jpg

<Cobellanez> Every single time I read Tavi, I imagine Navi teh fairy
<CupcakeWarrior> I like Bonbon
<MahBoi777> not bad at all

<nickstr> for ambient sounds of the area where the televised thing is taking place
<Chrysalis> 2pm mix?
<TheHoodyNinja> dat cute twilight
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> OMB|Piracy: i think u made a new friend
*TheHoodyNinja dances
<SparklyWaffles> AWWW YEAAAA
<Biglaw> hey guys im Biglaw lol!
<CupcakeWarrior> dat korobeiniki
<Wrek> 05its the only one
<Wrek> 05i like
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: if u dont mind me asking how do u afford all your stuff?
<TheHoodyNinja> hi Biglaw hows Biglaw doing?
<junh1024-XD> good surround adds more for almost everything, including music
<Chrysalis> Wrek: it is SUCH a good mix as well
<junh1024-XD> try to think outside the box
<OMB|Piracy> Friend? I'm too socially backwards to aquire such things
<TheHoodyNinja> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: work
<Biglaw> guys, I support FlareChaserxOctavia
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Nope
<Spell-of-Gaming> The Hub will apparently show the new Care Bears it's debut on June 2.
<Wrek> 05implying i own stuff
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Nopenope
<Biglaw> yes, yes you do.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: doesnt have job tho TheHoodyNinja
<junh1024-XD> i'll give an example: "the scene" prior to 2012, was xvid for SD, and H264 for HD
<Biglaw> Wait, what?
<SparklyWaffles> WAT IS THIS SONG I LIKE IT.
<TheHoodyNinja> Biglaw: You should never support cheating bastards
<CupcakeWarrior> Spell-of-Gaming: I think it should be streamed when it comes on
<SparklyWaffles> *breakdances*
<TheHoodyNinja> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: He doesnt?
<MahBoi777> Prince_Lightboom: wow, that pic makes me feel depressed
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: well u have ur computer
<junh1024-XD> but actually, H264 also benefits SD
<WallDives> SparklyWaffles: korobiniki, aka tetris.
<Chrysalis> SparklyWaffles: 2pm's remix of the tetris theme
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TheHoodyNinja: nah i asked him
*panda|animating glomps MahBoi777
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<TheHoodyNinja> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: how old is he?
<nickstr> video is one thing
<MahBoi777> hey panda|animating!:D
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: well u own u computer
<nickstr> audio is something else
<junh1024-XD> the reason they don't do it is because xvid has traditionally used with SD, and so it stuck for a long time
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TheHoodyNinja: u never ask Wrek his age
<Prince_Lightboom> MahBoi777: dont get depressed get cheered up https://s.deviantart.com/th/fs70/f/2011/171/b/6/b6bcde176d6f25be64e24cfb8306ed0c-d3jemjm.jpg
<panda|animating> MahBoi777: hiya :D
<Wrek> 05its called saving
<TheHoodyNinja> Biglaw: QUIT CHANGING YOUR NAME!
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'll give the new Care Bears a try, but it has really crappy CGI.
<Biglaw> TheHoodyNinja okay...
<superretroworld> Spell-of-Gaming: do you think it will have a fanbase like the bronies?
<junh1024-XD> yes, but the same applies - sticking to tradition is not always good
<CupcakeWarrior> It wont
<Saturn> 8,1evening, SparklyWaffles
<nickstr> another example of multichannel being inappropriate for music
<TheHoodyNinja> Prince_Lightboom: O///O
<nickstr> ever heard of quadraphonic sound?
<TheHoodyNinja> 3?
<junh1024-XD> yes
<nickstr> it was a big fad for music in the 1970s
<MahBoi777> O///O
<RaveBrony> Dat Saturn :D
<nickstr> but died off quickly
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> how does one save when one has no income Wrek ?
<junh1024-XD> i have a few quad songs
<VioletGreySha> hay Saturn
<SparklyWaffles> HALLOO~
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Denied.
<Saturn> 8,1hey VioletGreySha!
<junh1024-XD> because it was costly and the tech wasn't that great
<CupcakeWarrior> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Get a job :P
<nickstr> because it really did not make sense to many producers to have 4 channel sound
<Saturn> 8,1and RaveBrony
<Saturn> 8,1and everypony else
<RaveBrony> :$
<nickstr> even though it was possible
*Saturn 8,1fails at enumeration
<WallDives> hi Saturn.

*Invi licks Saturn
<MahBoi777> hey Saturn
<nickstr> they did not see the point in spending the extra money
*Saturn 8,1licks Invi back
<Chrysalis> Saturn: no you dont, you just don't batch it :P
<nickstr> because it really did not add much
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: do rob banks?
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: I have no idea what enumeration is :P
<junh1024-XD> same with 3D
*VioletGreySha husg Invi
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: do u rob banks?
<TheHoodyNinja> Hi Saturn welcome to weird world
<Chrysalis> CupcakeWarrior: go through a list

*CupcakeWarrior licks TheRainbowDash
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Wrek: COOL so do u actually study ? lol

<Saturn> 8,1CupcakeWarrior: it's a transitive verb, meaning to list off one by one

<FillyFlam> So there was this article on Cracked, about how TV shows would end if the writers had balls.
<nickstr> most likely because you can't get over the air 3D TV
<RaveBrony> Mai mamma sayz
<FillyFlam> And this show was in it. Their idea was "It was all a game of DnD."
<nickstr> the only ways to get it are cable, satellite, or Blu-Ray movies
<junh1024-XD> BBC is working on that
<OMB|Piracy> Light up some fire arrows and torch the kingdom
<nickstr> and video games to an extent
<PinkiePieFTW> idk about the show... I liked the first book.
