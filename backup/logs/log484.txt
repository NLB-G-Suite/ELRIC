<Shamroc> Shizuka....your comp really doesnt like runing ANYTHING
<DashWithRainbows> Shizuka Reminds me of when you stream.
<Kandarihu> An interesting fun fact from my liner notes. When this first premiered, they wanted to keep it a surprise that Hikaru would be piloting a Valkyrie, so they produced a special opening that omitted any sight of him in the cockpit.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Ponies47: S2 E10

<SunderlandPony89> How old is this anime?
<DocSane> 1986
<hen3ry> early 80s
<flutter_spin> O.o
<DocSane> Macross originally broadcast in 1982

<DocSane> You haven't seen anime from the 70's, then.
<flutter_spin> idiots. all of them.
<Kandarihu> Is the dub from 1986?
<DocSane> Dub was made in 1985-86
<Articuno> 12That sucks DRF!! I can't remember if you told me or not

<Sumica> 00,10it was late 70's in japan

<Sylandest> that was so blatant
<DocSane> Sumica: No, it was broadcast in 1985
<geeky-brony> sexism
<Om> lol
<Iron_Edge> Ah hell....sexism
<DocSane> Sumica: Trust me on this
<RainBowJack> it was aired in the netherlands around 88-89
<SunderlandPony89> I can really tell the emotions she's express from her facial expressions
<geeky-brony> Om: lol
<drf|laptop> 03well it's kinda misleading, and I'm a bit annoyed at my school
<Kandarihu> Sumica: the original aired from 1982-1983.

<flutter_spin> arguing is his weakness? Send more women?
<CupcakeWarrior> lol Shizu
<Midnight_Tempest> the thing at the time was if something was aired in NA in said decade, it was aired a decade prior in Japan...
<Sumica> 00,10but I recall seeing it on TV early then that.
<drf|laptop> 03last semester they were like "yeah, you don't need to go back to a company if you don't like it, as long as you do the one term there"
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: :D
<drf|laptop> 03well they want everybody to stay at the same company for all 4 years
<MahBoi777> Shizuka: LOL
<DocSane> Midnight_Tempest: This one didn't have a huge lag.
<flutter_spin> totally Shiz. I have been thinking that ever since I heard the FIRST announcement of the Wii U
<Mutterguy> except transfromers
<Chimera> Hi cuno :3
<Om> Just keep bickering, and the alieans will fall
<geeky-brony> lol
<drf|laptop> 03so when I told the company it was just a one time thing, the co-op managers were all "why do you want another job again?"
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah, applying to any places I can
<DocSane> Sumica: It couldn't have broadcast in 1982, since Macross was still on Japanese TV then.
<flutter_spin> hehe, I can think of a few things
<Kandarihu> Mind if I link to the AniDB on this?
<Midnight_Tempest> DocSane: maybe not but it was more of a joke than a true fact... though the lag could still be several years at the least
<MahBoi777> Om: seems legit

<Kandarihu> Well, they need to bring hardcore gamers into the fold. All the hot 3rd party titles are for the 360 and the PS3. If the Wii U isn't as well represented as the 720 and PS4, Nintendo might go the way of SEGA.

<Sylandest> Om: I have no words
<Mutterguy> actuallly at that scale.... they could destroy buildings...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Publisher obsession with killing/making money off of the used game market leads to crap like online passed and anti-used game tech.
<Darkts3> ahh remember when E3 was about gaming? instead of crappy ads?
<flutter_spin> hi baldy!
<Om> Sylandest: I can only imagine if you are a girl and watching this. How pissed you could be.
<SunderlandPony89> There's a Mega64 skit that sums up E3 in the past and the present. Been hell finding it though
<Sylandest> Om: it would be beyond pissed. It would be explosive rage
<Stallion_of_War> You! The fat one!
<MahBoi777> BALD

<Kandarihu> As for the Wii U is concerned, it doesn't matter if the library is filled in a sea of shovelware if there are plenty of great titles to be found.
<Om> And the trend continues, dumb guards
<geeky-brony> sems leget
<flutter_spin> The guard is like "they aren't paying me enough"

<Stallion_of_War> * girls or become a giant...
<flutter_spin> why not both?
<Saturn> 08,01i hate when my protoculture is tangled
<DocSane> See, originally, Protoculture was a Zentradi word for the original; galactic civiliazation which created them.
<hen3ry> dat grieving girlfriend
<Sylandest> Om: *loads up various internet material* hand this to them, and see how they react
<drf|laptop> 03http://imgur.com/gallery/TaMDf <- hahahahaha
<flutter_spin> is it possible for the girls to be giants?
<CupcakeWarrior> inb4 bad singing
<Om> I'm just guna say it. Because we all thought it. Giant. Gay. Sex
<SunderlandPony89> Apparently not flutter_spin
<DocSane> In Robotech, Carl Macek made it this amorphous energy source.

<Ponies> Why aren't there ears bleeding!
<CriticKitten> Better hook up with....somepony else, cuz Saturn most likely does not want
<DocSane> Fun fact: They got Rebecca Forstadt slightly drunk in order to get her to sing.
<Om> MahBoi777: Indeed. You just know some of those giants saw that and decided to try it them selves
<geeky-brony> immm dieeeing..... i need m..eeee...tal
<drf|laptop> 03totally risked my life taking that picture as I was driving
*drf|laptop runs
<Kandarihu> The Zentradi have no culture of any sort. The women would find this as revolting as the men.
<Sumica> 00,10sence every one hates spoilers
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn has best singing voice
<flutter_spin> ^^
<SunderlandPony89> ^
<Saturn> 08,01CupcakeWarrior: you've never heard me singing!

<Om> Sylandest: You have all the imagination you need.

<SunderlandPony89> DocSane: Wait! Metaoc... oh wait, that show isn't all that funny anymore
<Darkts3> =/
<Ponies47> :o
<Kandarihu> Well, all of Adult Swim's cartoons are done in Flash, so is MLP FiM
<DocSane> Never like Matalocalypse. The only Adult Swim show left that's any good is The Venture Brothers, and that's hardly ever on.
<CupcakeWarrior> I owuld watch MLP if it were on adult swim
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but [AS] uses a trial copy of flash

<Ninjazz|Challenge> Polydunami: Personally, I have no opinion on her.
<Shizuka> 13and no one finds two helicopters flying way way below safe altitude concerning in any way?
<CupcakeWarrior> DaringPineapple: You could use vocaroo.com
<Sumica> 00,10Oh hi Dari
<Polydunami> I like her voith
<Shizuka> 13the NPCs are just cool with it huh
<Ponies47> KiwiBoi777: fruit = EVIL! :O
<hen3ry> fun fact: almost all 80s movies sponsored by tobacco companies, getting their ads into film sometimes in strange ways
<Midnight_Tempest> Shizuka: nope... every day thing apparently

<Phase4> http://humblebronybundle.blogspot.com.au/ << or donate via here :P
<Ninjazz|Challenge> INDEED! Get the newest bundle! It also worth it just for Bastion!
<Hat> http://www.gamingdaily.co.uk/2012/valve-to-close-steam-gfwl-is-too-good/
<MahBoi777> YAY

<Phase4> Hat, Trololololo
<XAX> Phase4: BASTION. That game looks good. I must get it.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Oh, absolutely, Phase4.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> I love that game, and I am very saddened we don't have a cross over fic with it yet. :(
<Phase4> Ninjazz|Challenge, give it time
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Hell... I'll write one if I don't see one.
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ninjazz|Challenge> But time...
<MahBoi777> which game again?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> I hate waiting.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Bastion, MahBoi777.
<Ponies47> Looks like future Twilight :'(
<MahBoi777> Bastion? huh haven't heard of that one
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Serriously one of the better games of last year.
<dshannon> that fat prick finally did it?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> I think it's on the Xbox Live market place, MahBoi777.
<Phase4> any linux users here?
<Phase4> aside from me of course
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz|Challenge: what's it about?
<Starlight_Phoenix> Good night everypony

<StupidSexyCJ> dshannon: yeah i know right, its about time they started development on Beard Appreciator
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: when does a korra ep usually come out
<Ninjazz|Challenge> dshannon: No word yet. And don't diss Gabe like that. He trully deserves respect.
<Phase4> http://www.humblebundle.com/ << cause this comes with steam keys for both mac and windows, as well as linux versions, and drm free versions for all platforms
<XAX> Gaben is a true legend
<XAX> from the games he's made
<MahBoi777> Gaben is a BAWS
<XAX> to the fact he is one of up.
<XAX> us.*
<dshannon> he's clustering dozens of online games into dependency on one piece of software
<dshannon> and if that went bye-bye
<Ninjazz|Challenge> MahBoi777: It's about a huge calamity that destroys THE ENTIRE world. You play as a kid who is basically trying to fix everything and save whoever he can find.
<dshannon> those games are fudged
<Ninjazz|Challenge> But he treats gamers with respect.
<dshannon> bs he does
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz|Challenge: oh, well that sounds cool
<Ninjazz|Challenge> MahBoi777: Check it out sometime. It's AMAZING.
<XAX> Ninjazz|Challenge: He replies to some e-mails personally, for christ sakes.

<Ghosties> 04HAH, my hunch was right
<Ninjazz|Challenge> And that concludes the team's attempt at a crack pairing. I don't see why everyone hates it so much, I liked it! The song was nice too, in fact it's one of the only songs that I can sing perfectly lyric for lyric. Off to... A Friend In Deed. Inb4 Smile Smile Smile
<Ninjazz|Challenge> And what would that be, Ghosties?
<Ghosties> 04They did change Ellie's look in The Last of Us once the team for Beyond got Ellen Page to voice and model the leade character

<Ghosties> 04Consider everyone and their mothers thought that Ellie looked a loooooooooooooooot like Ellen Page, now that Ellen Page is actually the voice and modeled the lead character for another Sony title, Beyond, it's definitely not surprising though I was hoping that Ellen Page would stay as my 15 year old sidekick in a post-apocalyptic environment <3

<Invi|eaten> Airpuff I'm not a pirate but ditto ^^
<Vordox> God of Yawn I mean War...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lolol Airpuff
<Phase4> 00,02i'm getting dings from nowhere
<d3rb> fine :|
<Phase4> 00,02oh way
<Ninjazz|Challenge> We can't go any deeper than this...
<Articuno> 12Anyone else find it weird that my old form is attacking my new one in that photo? XD
<Ghosties> 04OH YEAH, I'm still paused at the awkward toilet moment in Rapture
<Phase4> 00,02MAXIMUM DEPTH REACHED
<Galloran> DING! DING! DI- *cuts hand off*
<d3rb> wow lol
<Kammerjunk> Airpuff: Valedico et habe lusus!
<dshannon> 0.o
<dshannon> I am seen!
<Galloran> ACH
<Galloran> the noise
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Ghosties: You might want to kindly scooch outa there.
<Irres> Haha XD your old one might have been better :P
<Phase4> 00,02dis is jrp's swag
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Indeed.
<Shimmer> Vordox: you shouldn't complain, sure they didn't come with anything new really but be happy they didn't ruin the good old recipe :p
<d3rb> :D
<Galloran> Fuck logic
<Ghosties> 04But that's not how it works, Ninjazz :(
<Phase4> 00,02and now to fix d3rb's problem
<Vordox> Shimmer: The Good Old recipe isn't good?
*Galloran fucks logic
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Ghosties: How do you suppose you get out of that then? :S
*Logic feels violated
<Vordox> LAWL PHASE
<Vordox> You are late =3
<Shimmer> Vordox: your opinion is tolerated
<d3rb> actually im pretty content with all this but i wont say no to more derpy
<Ghosties> 04The correct phrasing is "Ghosties, would you kindly leave that toilet?"
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: In Latin, 'ludus' means game, play, fun or entertainment. It also means school.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Ghosties, would you KINDLY leave that toilet.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> ?*
<Kammerjunk> Thus, it can be concluded that school = fun!
<Galloran> LIES
<Galloran> unless your latin
<Ghosties> 04So much emphasis on "kindly" :P
<Vordox> Shimmer: The Good Old receipt was never good....GoW is EXACTLY like Nightmare Creatures, WHICH WAS RELEASED BACK IN THE 90s! For Celestia's sake
<dshannon> dat tf3 server spam
<Ninjazz|Challenge> I just wanted to make sure you would do it. :D
<Kammerjunk> Galloran: Roman.
<Galloran> ...
<Kammerjunk> The romans spoke latin.
<d3rb> hey Ninjazz|Challenge ....whats the challenge refer too?
<Galloran> boy i will cut you
<Kammerjunk> Latin*
<dshannon> .....stupid teamspeak 3 getting all up in my brain
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Cause we all know that you would do it IF I say KINDLY.
<Shimmer> Vordox: again, your opinion :)

<Ninjazz|Challenge> Thank you, d3rb. :$
<Vordox> Shimmer: The only difference is AoE attacks(Which...funnily is old as feck in gaming) and QTE...."Press this to win" :P
<Galloran> ...
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|Challenge: I did a marathon with around 25 other guys and girls (Mostly guys) the week before S1. Took just about 10 hours.
<Kammerjunk> 'Twas fun.
<dshannon> lol
<d3rb> that can apply to ninjaz and dshannon that good luck thingy :)
<Kammerjunk> the week before S2*

<derpy_pony> http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm8/ThikJerseyChik/CaptObviousCat.jpg
<Shimmer> Your pc isn't good until it can run 5xcrysis 2 games, render a 1080p movie and browse justin bieber's twitter at the same time
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: DDAT KOALA
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Hey Scoot-Scootaloo!
<Lighty> 06i see you
<Lighty> 06sittin at your desktop
<Phase4> 00,02ikr
<Viri> 14hello
<Vordox> Ghosties: You went away D:
<Viri> 14o.o
<Ghosties> 04I'm back
<Galloran> I'm front
<d3rb> wb Ghosties
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Where you been?
<Ghosties> 04Kitchen
<Vordox> Ghosties: TWo things I wish to discuss with someone, and you seem to have the correct mindset to see where things are going.
<Galloran> Livingroom
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Not going to say anything.
<Kammerjunk> Shimmer: If your PC can run Crysis 2 x5, you need to stop using NASA's work computers.
<Vordox> Ghosties: Let's begin, Wonderbook? Thoughts?
<Viri> 14m-me?
*Viri looks around
<Ghosties> 04Should have had the Guildmaster from Fable narrating
<Galloran> Oh shit
<Galloran> dont get me started on him
<Ghosties> 04BUT
<Shimmer> Kammerjunk: why? It's not like they use them for anything useful
<Vordox> Ghosties: I meant, as a tool?
<Lighty> 06noU
<Ghosties> 04Guildmaster is awesome
<Ghosties> 04Oh, as a product?
<Galloran> be that as it may
<Kammerjunk> Shimmer: Oh no, not in the slightest.
<Phase4> 00,02i've never played sniper before XD
<Galloran> his fucking voice is engraved into my mind
<Viri> 14xD
<Viri> 14how are you? :P
<Kammerjunk> I never play Sniper.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> And that was It's About Time. Rather average episode. People say that it's a Twilight episode when Pinkie was actually the star of the show. Off to... Dragon Quest.
<Shimmer> Vordox: Wondahbook looked like an april's fool joke... at least it turned into one with all the time they spent presenting it
<DeadpoolDash> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/253/644.gif
<Ghosties> 04Gimmicky and nobody will buy it
<Vordox> Ghosties Shimmer: I see good value and possibility in it
<Ghosties> 04Save for maybe a Harry Potter fan
<Vordox> Ghosties: Maybe not for what it was developed for but still some value that can be had.
<Ghosties> 04Gimmicks
<Ghosties> 04That's exactly what it is
<Vordox> Ghosties: Those Gimmicks sells. :P
<Vordox> Ghosties: Well, conflicting, but even I see that's some value in it, just not for what it may be now though ,bleh
<Ghosties> 04But they're degrading to a core player
<Vordox> Ghosties: And now, the important question: Sony All Stars. :P
<Ghosties> 04No core player is going to buy it
<Ghosties> 04Alright
<Ghosties> 04All Stars
<Ghosties> 04What do you ask?
<Vordox> Ghosties: Worth of it's existance? :P I say no
<d3rb> why no?
<Kammerjunk> Sony All Stars? Sonic vs. Sonic?
<Ghosties> 04Without Crash Bandicoot it's terrible
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, Crash Bandicoot was fun.
<Litwick> XBT FUCKING SLEEP SO i'M GOING HERE.
<Vordox> d3rb: Even as a gameplay, it's stale, boring and pretty much a huge watered down version of Smash
<Ninjazz|Challenge> I don't even know what makes them think a Big Daddy is an Allstar.
<Galloran> I played the original crash games :^P
<DeadpoolDash> so epic http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/574/5fb.png
<Galloran> i find it funny how not many can say the same these days
<Ghosties> 04And even if Crash will be unveiled later, they should have unveiled Crash at E3
<Litwick> How'd I get xbt when I meant to type Can't?
<DeadpoolDash> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/575/019.png
<Vordox> Ghosties: And really...All characters I saw in the previes was...Parappa...That's it.
<d3rb> have you played it Vordox...
<Ghosties> 04Parappa was it
<DeadpoolDash> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/577/6f3.png
<Ghosties> 04Parappa was good
<Lighty> 06good
<Lighty> 06:3
<Lighty> 06you?
<Ghosties> 04But fucking Big Daddy?
<Viri> 14^^
<Vordox> d3rb: Playing and seeing has alot of things :P
<Ghosties> 04What does Big Daddy have to do with Sony -_-
<d3rb> yeah big daddy, wtf
<Galloran> Parappa was fucking Big Daddy?
<Phase4> 00,02i used to be a heavy like you
<Viri> 14I'm great :3
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Exactly.
<Vordox> Ghosties: Big...whatever.. Sly and Parappa = Mascot worthy
<Phase4> 00,02then i took an arrow to the everything
<Phase4> 00,02:P
<Ghosties> 04No sir, not in my book
<Ghosties> 04Crash Bandicoot
<Ghosties> 04He's the original mascot
<Phase4> 00,02^
*Ninjazz|Challenge fus ro dah's Phase4
<Ghosties> 04He's the heir
<Phase4> 00,02thats a point
<Phase4> 00,02where is crash
<d3rb> ^
<Ghosties> 04Crash was the original Sony mascot for the Playstation
<Galloran> I miss Crash
<Vordox> Ghosties: True, Crash almost did become Mascot of Sony
<Ghosties> 04He was
<Phase4> 00,02and sonic for that matter
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Crash was cool.
<Phase4> 00,02you know
<Phase4> 00,02besides ssbb
<Ghosties> 04He was considered the mascot for Playstation
<Vordox> Ghosties: He never was officially.
<Shimmer> Fu Phase4 I slammed my headphones on my head when I heard the tune
<d3rb> crash & cortex should be in it
<Ghosties> 04But to every game around the world he was
<Phase4> 00,02Shimmer, ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02awww
<Vordox> Ghosties: Yep, true
<Galloran> What of N.Brio
<Phase4> 00,02music stopped
<DeadpoolDash> the stream be back
<Shimmer> Noes
<Vordox> Ghosties: And now, WHAT characters would be good to have in All stars to pique interest? :P
<Ghosties> 04Spyro
<Ghosties> 04And Crash
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz|Challenge: 1 does not simply fus ro dah
<Galloran> HELL YEAH
<d3rb> yep
<Ghosties> 04Don't care about any others
<Galloran> Spyro is legend
<Shimmer> What Ghosties said
<Ghosties> 04Just Crash and Spyro
<Vordox> I say: Gex, Tomb Raider, Spyro, Crash, Nathan Drake(Why not),
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Ghosties> 04Gex
<Galloran> Though, i hate that they fucking put Spyro into a new game
<Ghosties> 04I would have to agree
<Galloran> and completely changed his look
<d3rb> gex i disagree
<Ghosties> 04Gex would be awesome
<d3rb> wasnt he on other pl;atforms?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Where was Gondor when one couldn't simply fus ro dah?
<Ghosties> 04Lara Croft...maybe
<Shimmer> Ratchet&Clank
<Galloran> :^P
<Ninjazz|Challenge> ^
<Vordox> Shimmer: OH YEAH! Those
<Ghosties> 04But Lara is gonna be multi-platform, if I'm not mistake
<Ghosties> 04*mistaken
<Vordox> Ghosties: She did start out as a Sony
<d3rb> but lara started on sony
<Ghosties> 04I thought Lara started on PC?
<Galloran> no
<Galloran> started on Sony
<Shimmer> Tomb Raider started on sony so I went wtf when they said it's gonna be xbox exclusive for starters
<Ghosties> 04Hmm, ah well
<Vordox> Ghosties: Also.. What about the Original Syphon Filter Guy? :P Logan
<Ghosties> 04Nope
<Ninjazz|Challenge> That would be awkward... I mean look at Lara now.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz|Challenge: everywhere
<Ghosties> 04Not recognizable
<d3rb> the problem is all these characters may have been on the ps1,2 or 3 but are not all owned by sony so it would be a pin in the ass to get rights for all of them
<Litwick> good morning people :)
<Shimmer> CLOUD needs to be on allstars
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane>
<Ghosties> 04Oh god
<Viri> 144 days of school left, and I still have three test to do xD
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: One does not simply go to everywhere.
<HyperMetalLugia> hi viri :3
<Vordox> Ghosties: Unless you played it I guess... What if we put in Jak and Daxter, which compliments Ratchet and Clank?
<Ghosties> 04If they get Cloud then FF fans would burst a tit if Sephiroth didn't make it in
<Viri> 14HML :D
<Galloran> YAYZ
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz|Challenge: hwere was gondor when one could not simply go everywhere
<Galloran> RC vs JD is one thing i want to see
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Mordor.
<d3rb> get tifa and cloud, ff fans will buy 3 sopies each
<d3rb> copies**
<Ghosties> 04Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank I also agree too
<Ghosties> 04*to
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz|Challenge: i wonder who i should wub more Invi|eaten or Airpuff
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Agreed as well.
<Vordox> There'll be no FF characters för certain, no way SquareEnix would allow it
<Ghosties> 04But not as four separate characters, only two
<Lighty> 06ohai derp
<Galloran> yup
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Why are you telling me this? :S
<Lighty> 06i still have like, 2 weeks left :3
<Ghosties> 04Save available character slots
<Galloran> especially RC
<Lighty> 06tests incoming~
<Galloran> being that they never really seperated
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz|Challenge: cause ur my friend
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Ratchet and Clank AS one character.
<Vordox> So we have Parappa, Gex, R&C, Spyro, Crash, J&D...
<Ghosties> 04Vordox
<Ghosties> 04You're forgetting though
<Litwick> Alright then, I'll just be screwinf around tumblr. ping me when you need me
<alexxm> Ghosties what are you talking about
<Vordox> Ghosties: Who?
<Viri> 14aww
<Ghosties> 04Snake was in fucking SSBB
<Shimmer> Solid Snake?
<Vordox> Ghosties: That's Japanese. :P
<Ghosties> 04And -_-
<Ghosties> 04So?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I know that... But why tell me?
<Vordox> Ghosties: Also, you know the backstory of WHY he is in it?
<d3rb> the game needs an r34 skyline to represent the 300 skylines on granturismo :D
<Vordox> It dates back to even Melee for god sake. <.<
<Ghosties> 04I've heard that Kojima pleaded with Nintendo to have him in...that's just hearsay, of course
<alexxm> Ghosties what game is this your talking about
<Vordox> Ghosties: It's..."kinda" true
<Ghosties> 04To advertise and market
<Ghosties> 04Super Smash Bros Brawl
<Lighty> 06i love google chrome
<Lighty> 06"you first visited this site on the 9th of June, 2015"
<Lighty> 06:D
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Can Nintendo do anything against that?
<Shimmer> Medievil, Oddworld?
<Vordox> Ghosties: And once Third party came in, Smash may become a world hit once more(Which it is)
<Vordox> MEDIEVIL!
<Vordox> <4
<Vordox> <3 YES
<Viri> 14o.o
<Vordox> And Abe from Oddworld is kinda...err...I'm not saying he can't fight but...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8u5/
<Vordox> He's kinda out of the place
<Ghosties> 04Okay okay
<Ghosties> 04I'll admit
<Ghosties> 04I defeated the Master Hand with Snake as my final character
<Litwick> So whp wants a hug?
<Ghosties> 04But that's only because
<Ghosties> 04Solid Snake is just far more badass than any other character in that roster
<Vordox> Ghosties: You know he's a Grand Top Tier. :P
<Phase4> 00,02lol pyro song
<Tov|Christmas> Litwick: Do you have Flame Body?
<d3rb> :d
<Vordox> Ghosties: Brawl is good, but compared to Melee it's not. Waiting for Project M
<Litwick> Nope, Flash Fire.
*Tov|Christmas gets hugged anyway
<Ghosties> 04I know I sound incredibly immature saying he's better than Mario, Donkey Kong, etc.
<Ghosties> 04Don't care
<Ghosties> 04Solid Snake
<Ghosties> 04Your argument is invalid
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Snake is cool.
<Thorn> sweet.
<Shimmer> Dante from Devil May Cry
<Litwick> Even as a Nintendo fanboy I agree.
<d3rb> snake > all characters....EVER
<Vordox> Ghosties: Hey, once Dave got into the game, F*CK logic and just have fun
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz|Challenge: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8uv/

<Ghosties> 04Oh lordy
<Vordox> Shimmer: True.. But he would kick everyone sarse :P
<Shimmer> Already mentioned
<Vordox> alexxm: Already mentioned
<Ghosties> 04Pyramid Head in All Stars :D
*Ninjazz|Challenge attacks Alicorn_Prince_Shane with hugs
<d3rb> Vordox: heaps of characters they COULD use...but getting the rights
<Ghosties> 04Now that would be hilarious
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :)
<Vordox> d3rb: Don't care. :P
<alexxm> ah right Shimmer and Vordox didn't know
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Whre was Crash Bandicoot? >: (
<d3rb> i know, i want to believe it will be an awesome game
<Shimmer> Pyramid Heads 3rd super: Brings the darkness to the whole arena
<Ghosties> 04In the mean while *goes to listen to Turtle Woods from CB2*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03where*
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: We're discussing "Fan favourites we want from Sony's good game era"
<Ghosties> 04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADVk0vDYz80
<Vordox> KLONOA!
<Ghosties> 04Just listen to that
<pony_1471> what about that vampire guy from soul reaver
<Ghosties> 04Pure awesome
<Vordox> GOOD old Klonoa!
<Vordox> pony_1471: OH! Soul Reaver guy = Good bet
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03But I liked the Bandicoot games :(
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Probably a Helghast soldier too cause Sony loves its Killzone.
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: Everyone wants Crash in All stars =3
<alexxm> Vordox was onimusha ever on other consoles apart from playstation
<Vordox> alexxm: Yes, it jumped over to Dreamcast, then to Nintendo as well
<|Discord|> Hia everypony!
<Ghosties> 04Crash Bandicoot 2 is on my PS3 hard drive
<Shimmer> Cervantes from original Soul Edge
<d3rb> hey |Discord|
<Ghosties> 04Because Crash is just awesome
<alexxm> ah right thought that would have been a good choice if it didn't Vordox
<d3rb> what about 1 and 3?
<Shimmer> Ghosties: I have 1, 2, 3 and CTR on my hard drive :p
<alexxm> hey |Discord| hows your day been
<Vordox> alexxm: True, would be a good addition, kinda fits the whole place.
*|Discord| hugs d3rb alexxm
<d3rb> Shimmer: you has ps plus dont you
<|Discord|> alexxm: Pretty good so far
<Shimmer> Nop
<d3rb> ohh ok, i got it, they were all free one month
<Vordox> ALUNDA!
<Vordox> Alunra*
<Vordox> BAH
<Ascendant> [21:14:31] <~Articuno> !chatstats
<Ascendant> [21:14:37] <~Articuno> !chatstats
<Ascendant> [21:14:40] <~Articuno> :(
<Ascendant> [21:14:46] <Drake> :/
<Ascendant> [21:14:49] <Drake> usually it works
<Ascendant> [21:14:53] <~Articuno> Ascendant what went wrong?
<d3rb> well "free", paid for ps plus
<Shimmer> d3rb: nah I bought them all, long ago :)
<Ascendant> [21:14:56] <Drake> wait
<Vordox> Ape Escape..but kind of wrong element imo
<Ascendant> [21:15:01] <Drake> Scriptbot isn't there
<alexxm> how about someone from tekken
<Ascendant> it got broken, I'll fix it when the server comes back up
<|Discord|> the song is calling me
<Shimmer> Jin Kazama for sure
<Vordox> alexxm: Too mainstream, and that's Konami
<Vordox> Or Capcom whatever
<alexxm> Vordox as far as i'm aware tekkens only been on playstation
<Shimmer> I would have Cervantes from Soul Edge but guess he's not famous enough :)
<Vordox> alexxm: It did start out heavily on that yes
<Shimmer> Tekken 6 is on xbox too alexxm
<Viri> 14Articuno :D
<Vordox> But fine, Tekken = In then, :P
<Vordox> Any of Tekken, whatever, no character etc etc.
<alexxm> oh i didn't know that Shimmer
<d3rb> so many characters potentialy...please dont screw it up sony, i want it to be a great game
<valoreins|Work> tekken is made by namco
<Vordox> Shimmer: Soul calibur(Formerly Soul Edge) started out on PSX
<Ghosties> 04Tekken 6 was terrible
<valoreins|Work> not konami or capcom
<Shimmer> I know Vordox
<Ghosties> 04But I'm a weird fighter fan, so yeah
<Vordox> If we REALLY bring out the guns...Resident Evil Character(Any)
<Shimmer> Nemesis
<Ghosties> 04nah
<pony_1471> random tyrant 001
<d3rb> :D the nemesis
<Vordox> Ghosties: Imagine Leon :P
<Litwick> Wubs all around.
<Ghosties> 04Meh
<Ghosties> 04I mean
<Lighty> 06i love my email alerter sound
<Ghosties> 04I absolutely *love* Resident Evil 2
<Lighty> 06it goes BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD!
<Ghosties> 04But we wouldn't get believable Leon
<Shimmer> Nemesis with his killer tongue (literally)
<Vordox> Ghosties: He showed he can do melee stuff in 6...after all. :p
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8xa/
<valoreins|Work> dat twilight
<dshannon> 2nd best song
<YokuPony> I came on the stream the right time :)
<valoreins|Work> o.o
<YokuPony> Woodentoaster = Epic
<Vordox> LOOOL! Just saw Colim McRae racing on this list.. <3 I miss you man.. I really do
<Ghosties> 04We'd get generic bad-ass Leon Kennedy with a bland voice Leon
<derpy_pony> seconded, YokuPony
<Vordox> Colin*
<alexxm> hey YokuPony hows your day been
<derpy_pony> this guy did much for the fandom
<Viri> 14xD
<Ghosties> 04I just hate how Capcom repackaged Leon
<Ghosties> 04He was so much better in RE2
<Ghosties> 04So much more believable
<Vordox> Ghosties: He was "in character" :p
<Ghosties> 04Had more character
<Ghosties> 04And he didn't sound boring
<YokuPony> alexxm: Walked to my local store....in heavy rain....with the flu -.-
<Vordox> OH!
<Ghosties> 04Paul Haddad had an awesome voice
<Vordox> For All Stars = CROC!(But he was on N64 too)
<Articuno> 12LOL
*alexxm hugs YokuPony
<Ghosties> 04It felt very much like it could have been a thing for Leon
<YokuPony> :)
<Ghosties> 04But now we have Paul Mercier
<d3rb> yeah croc wouldnt work
<Ghosties> 04And we just have to accept that...or rather I do
*Ghosties sighs
*Ninjazz|Challenge pats YokuPony on the back
<Ghosties> 04Yoku...why man?
*Vordox brohooves at Ghosties to cheer him up? /)

<Master-Derpy> hi everypony
<Ghosties> 04Man, Yoku...no car?
<Articuno> 12I am disappointed, I just found out that Andrew has taken me off his friend list on Facebook.
*Shimmer mind controls Ghosties and makes him brohoof Shimmer
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Saw that coming... :D
<Twi_Fi> Hello Master-Derpy
<Lil_B> hi Master-Derpy
<YokuPony> Ghosties: Nope, learning to drive never interested me
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Hey Master-Derpy!
<Soital> 12o.o did he ever give you a reason?
<alexxm> hey Master-Derpy what have you been up to
<Articuno> 12This is only weeks after I saw him at the shops and asked him if he was coming to our wedding or not.

<Vordox> And why not...Kingdom Hearts.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: Ninjazz|Challenge http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8y9/
<Lil_B> oh and hi Twi_Fi XD

<Chimera> Hope you two are happy together Arti x3
<Hawkie> What....
<Chimera> Yeah that sucks
<Chimera> ;-;
<alexxm> Vordox square enix and disney double copyrights
<Twi_Fi> Hello alexxm :) . It has been okay.
<Viri> 14:(
<Chimera> @ the andrew thing
<Soital> 12How about texting him and asking?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey Twi_Fi
<Hawkie> he's STILL not said anything?
<Lighty> 06and knowing internetsites like Facebook, Twitter, Hyvex etc, its all silly .-.
<YokuPony> Ghosties: I could have, but I doubt they'd be home anytime soon :\
<Vordox> alexxm: They still are Exclusives to Sony =P
<Hawkie> Soital, won't help if he doesn't reply
<Ninjazz|Challenge> But I like hugging Ghosties. c:
<Vordox> (except for one GBA title)
<d3rb> Vordox: ever play katamari damacy (spelling?)
<Articuno> 12Well, he invited me and Xai to his engagement party a couple of months ago
<Soital> 12I supppose...worth the try?
<Lil_B> I have to get that small screwdriver from my neighbor again, something is still not right with my little Casio Keyboard :/
<Articuno> 12we couldn't go but we told him why
<YokuPony> oh yeah, what happened at the sony conference?
<Soital> 12ahh o.o
<Twi_Fi> Hello Alicorn_Prince_Shane :)
<dishwasher_EXTREME> why is my screen saying "we are doing maintenance"?
<Chimera> Huh.
<Hawkie> oh he's gotten engaged?
<Articuno> 12then after that, I sent him an email asking if he could make our wedding (a bit last minute) but no reply.. none at all
<Viri> 14maybe he was busy? :(
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: http://t.qkme.me/35rfe2.jpg
<Chimera> Owch
<Shimmer> Rayman should be on allstars
<Hawkie> Right.
<Vordox> Shimmer: True
<derpy_pony> louder!
<Articuno> 12and then after that, I saw him at Morrisons so I went up to him and asked if he got the email, his reply was "oh yeh I did, I dont think we will be able to make it though sorry" so we said goodbye
<Master-Derpy> yay
<Articuno> 12Next thing I know, off his friends list :/
<alexxm> Shimmer first game i got for the ps2
<Chimera> There are many factors yo consider...
<Ghosties> 04Saved that, Shane
<Chimera> To consider
<Lil_B> also, when does the Nintendo conference start again?
<derpy_pony> :)
<Viri> 14D:
<Shimmer> 3 hours 46 mins Lil_B
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: which one the one does not simply hug Ghosties ?
<Ghosties> 04File name: even boromir agrees
<valoreins|Work> 4 more hours Lil_B
<Articuno> 12and yeh he's engaged to this girl he met right after he cancelled the Newcastle meet
<alexxm> how about the guy from uncharted
<Vordox> Mary Kate & Ashely Crush Course <---- LAWL! MUST VOTE!
<Hawkie> well, I didn't know Andrew that well, but it's incredibly disappointing when people don't explain themselves.
<Chimera> Heh
<Ghosties> 04The picture
<Hawkie> Ah, that gal
<valoreins|Work> which is 11 PM in my place
<pony_1471> sony owns digimon right?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: k
<Shimmer> alexxm: Nathan Drake is confirmed for allstars
<Articuno> 12I sent him a message just now saying "Bye then :/"
<Lil_B> valoreins|Work wow, soo soon? thanks
<alexxm> Shimmer sorry i didn't know that
<derpy_pony> http://www.buzzlol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Meanwhile-in-Australia.jpg
<valoreins|Work> np
<Hawkie> From experience I know that it can take months before you feel ready to explain anything, but then you damn well do it, rather than just pull the goddamn disappearing act on someone you've been friends with for ages!
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Apparently, he doesn't speak to ninjas, but when he does... he speaks to me. :)
<Shimmer> alexxm: No need to be sorry mate
<Lil_B> pony_1471 no Toei i think,
<Vordox> You know...Megaman's most X titles are PSx.... <.<
<Soital> 12I agree
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> derpy_pony: thats my internet cable
<Viri> 14same
<Litwick> 030
<Articuno> 12He's my oldest friend
<Texasboykc09> what is he playing
<Soital> 12Has he stopped talking to you ever since he's been engaged and you didn't go?
<Articuno> 12I only saw him a matter of weeks ago.. I don;t get it
<Shimmer> Cole from Infamous
<alexxm> has dead space been on xbox
<Articuno> 12Well.. no.. he had not spoken properly to me in ages
<Shimmer> I think so yes
<Viri> 14people are weird sometimes
<Ninjazz|Challenge> And that ends Dragon Quest, the introduction of Pee Wee, Spike's new pet. Too bad we NEVER see him again. Maybe Spike did eat him afterall. Off to... Hurricane Fluttershy.
<Vordox> O.D.T <3 Must have characters..ALL 3 of them!
<DitzyHooves> r we streaming e3
<alexxm> right thanks Shimmer
<DitzyHooves> also the newsletter is messed up
<somepony_else> hello everypony
<DitzyHooves> Lottery will be held on Friday....
<Lil_B> hi somepony_else
<alexxm> hey somepony-else hows your day been
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> http://t.qkme.me/35rfe2.jpg
<DitzyHooves> Intermisssion will be held on TUESDAY
<Viri> 14something similar happened to me, but in a much more complicated way xD
<Vordox> OH!
<Viri> 14I still miss him, but heh...his loss
<Vordox> Parasite Eve
<somepony_else> hi Lil_B and alexxm .)
<somepony_else> what is this? :D
<DitzyHooves> I think that might be a typo
<Articuno> 12Viri one day I will reply to your huge message :>
<Articuno> 12XD
<Ascendant> One day I will an hero and everyone will cry
<Viri> 14ok xP
<Articuno> 12He's taken Xai off as well it seems..
<Ascendant> And then I can laugh at everyone and go "Y U NO CRY HARDER"
<Ascendant> o_O
<Shimmer> Nariko from Heavenly Sword would be an awesome char for allstars
<Twi_Fi> Hello somepony_else
<DitzyHooves> Intermisssion will be held on TUESDAY?
<somepony_else> hi Twi_Fi
<Hawkie> Arti he still has you on Steam, but i've no idea if he's even on there
<Hawkie> or whatever
<Vordox> LAWL that bad interview by Sony XD
<Soital> 12has he deleted his FB, thats a possibility?
<DitzyHooves> they did so bad Nintendo is the winner by default
<DitzyHooves> are we streaming the nintendo conference?
<Articuno> 12Nope it;s all there lol
<DitzyHooves> (please say yes)
<pony_1471> i hope
<Hawkie> heh
<Articuno> 12Thats how I realised he'd taken me off, I went there and it said "Add as a friend" D:
<Soital> 12Oh I see :/
<somepony_else> maybe they've got something planned for tuesday...
<DitzyHooves> who wants to watch LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE?
<Hawkie> mhm :/ facebook isn't all-important, but when someone has been that dodgy with you for ages then...
<Ghosties> 04...man, if Crash isn't in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale I'm going to be *incredibly* disappointed and won't feel the urge to buy the game
<Soital> 12He might be hurt you didn't go to his engagement even though you had a valid excuse
<Shimmer> Indeed
<Ghosties> 04So "No Crash, No Buy"
<Soital> 12and if he;s a stubborn person...?
<Shimmer> Crash is THE icon char for PS
<DitzyHooves> after whatever happens
<Hawkie> Hard to say
<Vordox> Ghosties: I'm not buying it unless they ACTUALLY CHOOSE people that HAS characters... ._.
<Articuno> 12He's not like that
<Articuno> 12Trust me
<Ghosties> 04And I'd much rather have OLD Crash, please...new Crash is really, really creepy
<Soital> 12Okies :3
<Ghosties> 04He doesn't even look right
<Vordox> TAI FU!
<Soital> 12It's a bit odd though, I hope you get a reply =<
<DitzyHooves> are u streaming ghosti?
<Viri> 14same
<Articuno> 12I personally think that he knows we've drifted apart and instead of coming to an agreement about it, he thought he'd just silently take me off and hope I don't notice >v>
<Ghosties> 04HOLY
<Ghosties> 04SHIT
<Ghosties> 04Tai Fu
<Shimmer> Crash with supers: aku aku and his go-kart
<Ghosties> 04Oh my god
<Articuno> 12but I replied to basically all his FB updates lol
<Ghosties> 04...holy fuck
<Vordox> >.>
<Ghosties> 04It's been...
<Ghosties> 04years
<Vordox> Ghosties you okay?
<Ghosties> 04Jesus
<Ghosties> 04You mentioned a name I hadn't heard since my childhood
<Ghosties> 04Fuck
<Ghosties> 04Great
<Ghosties> 04Now I wanna go on a Tai Fu binge
<Vordox> You have NO idea how long I've been into gaming and games. :P
<valoreins|Work> suddenly childhoodgasm
<Shimmer> Holy shit I had to google it cuz I forgot the name
<Shimmer> Tai Fu was awesome
*Lil_B whispers to Vordox "Whats Tai Fu?"
<Hawkie> Could be.
<Litwick> Meh, that's nothing. You should see what happens when people mention that one card game show from 4kids.
<Soital> 12Even if you drifted I wouldn't delete a friend of mine I haven't spoke to for a little while, it's not like you had a huge argument or something o.o
*Vordox leans over to Lil_B and whispers short."A beat em up game with 3D element back on PSX, it's like that Kung Fu Panda, but about 15 years earlier"
<Articuno> 12Yeh.. well I guess he wants to completely forget that part of his life
<Soital> 12I see :/
<Shimmer> And with a kickass skinny tiger instead of a fat panda
<Ghosties> 04Man...Tai Fu...wow
<Hawkie> unfortunately some people are very avoidant, and prefer not to address things that could potentially be upsetting.
<Ghosties> 04...I wanna play it again
<YokuPony> dis song :D
<Shimmer> Emulatortime!
<Vordox> Calm down Ghosties ...these are just "Thoughts" on All Stars
*Lil_B Whispers back to Vordox "Thanks... I gonna google that real quick"
<Ghosties> 04No no, I know
<DitzyHooves> isn't it supposed to be Tai Chi?
*Vordox nods happily at Lil_B
<Ghosties> 04I'm just saying I wanna play Tai Fu again
<DitzyHooves> not Tai Fu
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Invi: and Airpuff meet Twi_Fi <-- thats ur grandmaw Airpuff and Invi
<Ghosties> 04HAH, I still remember the tagline for the game!
<Vordox> Ghosties: You know there is the whole PS2 era too...:P
<Shimmer> Ghosties: you should totally screw TF2 and go stream some Tai Fu
<Twi_Fi> O_O
<Twi_Fi> Oh

<Articuno> 12I can't remember Hawkie
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Hey ImOkayWithThis.
<Lil_B> For me, Digimon is the MLP of Anime. It has Real Emotion Drama And Tension and it takes its Audience seriously
<Tov|Christmas> The silver snakes always lost
<ImOkayWithThis> yo Ninjazz|Challenge
<Viri> 14I remember they DDoSsed a hosting website called Aruba because they could steal all users' credit card informations
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Twi_Fi: if u havent seen it http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8uv/
<Ninjazz|Challenge> :)
<Lil_B> Same For Detective Conan, for a Kids Anime it was amazing
<Viri> 14but I could remember wrong xD
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF said that the host/hetzner thought he had a virus (Most likely dream world hax program) so his account went byebye

<Ghosties> 04Dreamworks made Tai Fu
*alexxm hugs Ghosties
<Twi_Fi> Oh yeah I saw it earlier, Alicorn_Prince_Shane. I lol'd. :D
<Ascendant> It's down atm because of the DDoS, has been happening every night around this time for several hours
<Shimmer> Sackboy, Nariko, Ico, Wander, gief them all for allstars
*Ninjazz|Challenge has his mind bloan
<Vordox> Ghosties: INSPIRATION STRUCK AND BUCKED UP GHOSTIE'S WORLD!

<Ghosties> 04Not "made" but certainly published it
<Ascendant> I can't get into the server atm

<Viri> 14is there anything you can do about it?
<AnonPony> alexxm Its a great day...Cause Summer is starting...
<Hawkie> Well, yeah DDoS attacks aren't very pleasant, but I don't .. argh. I'm sorry to hear
*alexxm hugs AnonPony
<Viri> 14increasing security?

<ehm> "You've won two pendants in the Temple Games. WHO's going first?"

<Phase4> 00,02i'ma play prop hunt
<HyperMetalLugia> nope
<Ghosties> 04...da fuq...they abandon Tai Fu for Kung Fu Panda? DA FUQ
<Viri> 14reporting to cyber police?
<Ascendant> DDoS has nothing to do with security tbh
<Viri> 14(I think that's the correct name)
<Phase4> 00,02too much lag for anything else
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff: its a quick meme lol

<Ascendant> they have better things to do than sift through 600k lines of DDoS logs
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :D:D Awesome
<Ghosties> 04But it wasn't Tai Fu ;_;
<Twi_Fi> :D
<NickelMask> can i join what sever is it
<Ghosties> 04It was a spiritual successor
<Ghosties> 04Like Bioshock to System Shock
<Vordox> Ghosties: And now that Kung Fu Panda is big hit...Maybe Tai Fu makes a cameo or becomes a part of it?
<DeadpoolDash> time to sleep
<AnonPony> I wonder if its normal if i scream at this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ljjOTbLjg ?

<Vordox> DitzyHooves: Old news, and no links during stream
<Ghosties> 04Huh, so Dreamworks actually was the developer while Activision was the publisher
*alexxm hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<DitzyHooves> It's the Star Wars Trilogy like you've never heard it before! Join voice actors Billy West, Tara Strong, Maurice LaMarche, John DiMaggio, Kevin Conroy, Jess Harnell and Rob Paulsen as they re-create the magic of the Star Wars films
<YokuPony> The ACIII demo was really good :)
<Vordox> DitzyHooves: Most of us already heard the full thing
<Kandarihu> So BG&E2 is on it's way?
<Ascendant> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17036030/lolidonteven.gif
*Ascendant hides
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Only conceptually.

<DitzyHooves> they do multiple voices
<Ghosties> 04Also, ACIII was fantastic
<Vordox> Kandarihu: There was a Trailer once...
<DitzyHooves> like the first scene Bubbles= Darth Vader
<Ghosties> 04Though I admit, I'm actually more excited for Watch Dogs
<E3Surge> Lil_B: Bubbles as Darth Vader. That is all.
<DitzyHooves> or something
<Viri> 14watched :D
<Ghosties> 04But that naval battle was BADASS
<Ninjazz|Challenge> My opinion on AC3 was changed immediately.

<GLaDOS> Name a game that sucks that was released in 2011!

<Sylandest> Saturn: YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH- Wait, I have no money....
<Invi> Saturn where was the pun?
<Ghosties> 04I expected you to know all the obscure titles :D
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: pun?

<E3Surge> Ghosties: not an ACTION RPG :D
<Invi> Saturn as far as i know, that is how that meme works ^^
<Sylandest> Invi: perhaps the pun was in there being no pun at all? :O
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, I was wrong about that
<Ghosties> 04It was 1998
<TheRandomkid321> Bronysith. I am a cod/battle field guy. I have tried TF2 but I just didnt like it... probably my mac cuase it takes 5 minutes to load a map.
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: meme?
<Saturn> 08,01who said there was a meme?
<Phase4> 00,02i have bastion and superbrothers swords and sorcery but their very single player things
<Ghosties> 04I consider BFM an RPG
<Vordox> Not sure on how the game was. But dat hair XD
<Invi> Saturn i thought about these comics on 9gag ^^
<Bronysith> TheRandomkid321: i dont like cod or bf cause its mostly catered towards little kids and its the same game every entry and BF3 catered towards noobs with the ultimate shortcut pack
