<SAFR_> But this means Discord has been imprisoned even longer than Luna
<Cypresswolf> yep, Celestia knows how to defeat Discord since She defeated him once before, but didn't bother telling the mane 6 much background, just "time is of the essence, off you go"
<Jon> We are never watching that G1 MLP movie.

<mib_ujhaex> when is discord playing?
<filleg> Bye bronies!

<Nittany_Tiger> I fell asleep sometime after Look Before You Sleep.
<Cypresswolf> Im more interested in learning more of Equestrias past before Celestia & Luna, is it like the 1st Fable where Jack of Blades ruled Albion before the rise of heroes?

<jayands> hmmm. tough choice.
<Saturn> Morp: YES! THIS!

<Heliopause> If Discord is Q, does that make Celestia Picard?
<mib_kirgl5> i guess i am now Pissy Pie
<mib_zij7jt> just woke up and fount this
<StarlightIronhoof> 12Saturn: isn't it though?

<NewDCD> 9so uh guys
<DashWithRainbows> >checking equestria daily for stuff
<EarthTwighlit> the rest of the episodes probably wont be so bad to wait for, but this? This is cruel
<NewDCD> 9mib: recording http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/17328113
<ProfesorRod> thanks Owlowiscious :D
<Wolfur> lol, discored has messed with the youtube video :P
<Alexann> It is seriously on YouTubne
<BronyBrian> agin agin
<RAWRity> I gotta say, there are few things worth staying up all night for. this was one of them.
<Alexann> *YouTube
<mib_2dmb1o> fail
<EmeraldVision> Ya
<mib_niy2ko> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
<Owlowiscious> Hoo!
<Nittany_Tiger> That recording has video lag.
<mib_2dmb1o> niy2ko
<EarthTwighlit> that was fast
<Nyst> Serious question here; we all remember certain nightmare fuel from our childhoods; Do you feel this will create nightmare fuel for a future generation?
<Alexann> No. I am not falling for that.
*ProfesorRod pets dat Owl
<Owlowiscious> Rawrity, agreed.
<mib_2dmb1o> we see what it is
<RC> 0I'm ten minutes into this episode. Derpy is now a main character
<DarkRook> u be trollin, but not as well as Discord
<RoboPlop> Is it commercial-free?
<Billaxle> EmeraldVision, i feel your pain... :(
<DarkRook> I am not amused
<Tovler> nope
<Alexann> It's a goddamn RickRoll
<GordonFreemane> yes nyst
<mib_9v3t8f> Lol u mad
<TwentyPrcntLessCool> don't think so
<DSNesmith1> nah
<LiquidWolf> 0well, I can try to salvage a few hours rest now, goodnight fellow bronies
<TwentyPrcntLessCool> and it's pretty laggy
<LordCelestia> no
<DSNesmith1> that wasn't THAT scary
<Tovler> Don Bluth films are scary as fuck
<mib_2dmb1o> 4chan
<Wizzardess> Heh, nice!
<LanserT2> its just the stream record
<GordonFreemane> pinkie pie's bit was nightmare fuel.
<ponimypony> Cherilee: "He has the head of a pony..."
<DarkRook> I AM NOW MAD, LIKE FLUTTERSHY
<Jon> The balloons will
<EmeraldVision> @billaxle I have an idea!
<MeteorVenture> probably for SOMEONE out there
<mib_2dmb1o> turned in to 5chan
<mib_9v3t8f> It's me again - the incorrect youtube link guy
<Alexann> I didn't watch it, so technically I was never RickRolled.
<GordonFreemane> pinkie pie's bit was nightmare fuel. TRUST ME.
<DSNesmith1> okay the balloons were pretty fucking creepy
<ponimypony> DATS A HORSE
<Billaxle> whatever, i'm staying right here
<Alexann> But still...
<RAWRity> So, what's everypony's opinion of discord?
<mib_2dmb1o> cause of discord
<RoboPlop> Figured. No way they could trim it up that fast.
<DSNesmith1> discord = Q
<mib_9v3t8f> Lol
<Jon> Likable
<mib_9v3t8f> Actually
<Billaxle> untill its oficially on youtube
<MeteorVenture> i actually don't remember nightmare fuel though
<DSNesmith1> which is AWESOME
<RC> 0So is the owl
<GordonFreemane> Rafasde, evil fucker
<mib_9v3t8f> I WAS RICKROLLED AS WELL
<Owlowiscious> Discord is a master troll
<NewDCD> actually nevermind dari
<mib_9v3t8f> I didn't watch the video
<Alexann> Umad?
<Owlowiscious> Also, rage
<LanserT2> probably have to at least wait the day for higher quality stuff to trim and process
<SmokeyTreble> Excellent. Now's I can watch the beginning
<mib_tgrvz8> discord is awesome
<NewDCD> gonna use the HQ popout
<LordCelestia> Draconiquis
<mib_9v3t8f> and i posted the link
<LordCelestia> ?
<Nyst> Yeah I'm betting some kids are going to have balloon nightmares tonight
<Owlowiscious> Hate and love.
<DarkRook> :(
<mib_9v3t8f> No...just dissapoint.
<Billaxle> untill then i will post epic Pony Videos!
<prince-dari> ...
<jayands> lol we need stephen coltbert to define victoriful.
<Wolfur> Problem? :P
<EmeraldVision> Billaxle http://www.youtube.com/user/pensivepony
<Jon> I like how hes taking a whole different approach than NMM
<CriticKitten> He's amusing.
<MakerDusk> I'm with DSNesmith1
<Nyst> I love Discord utterly. He's a fantastic villain.
<EmeraldVision> you will find it there
<BronyBrian> fluttershy was great tho
<MakerDusk> he IS Q
<DSNesmith1> discord's great
<Jon> NMM=Pure force Discord=Betrayal.
<DSNesmith1> he cheats
<Alexann> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik
<RAWRity> Discord's no really SCARY, just a great villain. Well done FiM team.
<Jon> ...Question?
<Discord> Thanks Nyst
<EmeraldVision> By 8pm tonight
<prince-dari> So now I have half of the switched and half of them not.
<NewDCD> 9guys
<ProfesorRod> Sweetie Belle is a dictionary
<DarkRook> 8PM? ThATS 12 HOURS?
<ProfesorRod> first word is aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<NewDCD> 9see the High Quality Stream Popout button under the stream?
<DerpyHooves> wheres Luna? did she die or something?
<Billaxle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-LpZyq3G18
<DarkRook> too long
<NewDCD> 9please click it.
<LanserT2> also horn key wat
<NewDCD> 9we'll be streaming through there
<prince-dari> And the HQ popout is a different channel to the Dance of Machine God one
<DarkRook> Luna died and went to Troll heaven
<prince-dari> And only some of the popouts are still that one.
<Jigglysaint> so I wonder how many target demographic actually caught the show?
<Nyst> Thanks
<DSNesmith1> where?
<Jon> How does he know all about the ponies?He was trapped in stone.
*Minuet does not click it.
<CriticKitten> They did a good job delivering him differently than NMM.
<DarkRook> i.e, she was banished to the moon again
<prince-dari> I'm just going to switch them all now DCD.
<DSNesmith1> I don't see a button
<a041744> Pop outs are awesome
<DarkRook> see her in 3rd season
<NewDCD> oh
<Alexann> Celestia's the troll
<Skippy> Q can't break the prime directive either, that's why he's not showing his true self
<NewDCD> switch them
<DerpyHooves> cuz there is a lot of mention of her in episode 1 on session 2
<Euponytor> the target demographic was SCARRED FOR LIFE
<Billaxle> no s2 spoilers please!
<Big_Macintosh> 3Ah don't know.. but ah wanna watch it again.
<Jigglysaint> mind you it was awesome to get up for Saturday morning cartoons again
<NewDCD> 9actually nevermind
<RBD> wish I had a higher quality version of that Episode on Youtube ; 3;
<EmeraldVision> Dude, it beets Not seing it at all
<FreezeFrame> "-Discord's voice is ACE! Seriously, I'd never heard of John de Lancie before, but he NAILED it!" wut.
<NewDCD> 9we'll just stream normally
<DerpyHooves> wow Trollestia
<RoboPlop> They're replaying it tomorrow and Monday too I think.
<EmeraldVision> *Seeing
<Billaxle> kthxbai!
<ProfesorRod> new meme is a go
<Euponytor> but it's official
<DarkRook> SPOILER: TROLLING HAPPENS
<Euponytor> the show is now for the bronies
<Nyst> My guess he's got a limited amount of omnipotence. As soon as he got out, he instantly knew.
<Alexann> I don't want spoilers. I did see that one-minute Discord clip, though...
<Euponytor> they're marketing to us now
<DerpyHooves> TROLLING
<DSNesmith1> of course he nailed it
<Cypresswolf> Great first episode, kept me on the edge of my couch. the anticipation lived up to the hype for me, in more ways than I expected. I love Pinkie Pie's thoughts on Discord's world vs Celestia Rule "Discord comes with chocolate rain. Chocolate RAIN!"
<DarkRook> trolololololol
<DSNesmith1> he played that role for how many years? :P
<Jon> Maybe he has a connection to the elements?
<FreezeFrame> Someone actually said that in the EqD comments
<Jigglysaint> now I need to check Treehouse TV to see if the episode they advertise is actually a later s2 episode
<Jon> Them being used on him?
<mib_niy2ko> guys teh writiers know luna demand is high if they show her too early they give up a full house early when they have a winning hand, there going to hold her in reserve till ratings drop
<DerpyHooves> you didint see it yet?
<Jon> THat would explain it.
<Euponytor> bringing in Q, referencing memes... Hasbro knows where the money is
<Jigglysaint> it says the title is "Trinidad Stilts"
<Alexann> No
<Nyst> omniscience, sorry
<EmeraldVision> So basicly, shit happens, not that different from S1
<Alexann> I missed the livestream.
<Jigglysaint> which I suspect to be some sort of error
<DerpyHooves> awww :(
<EmeraldVision> right?
<mib_9v3t8f> MIB talks like a politician
<Big_Macintosh> 0Some stay dry an' other feel the pain!~
<DerpyHooves> same but i watched it somewhere else
<mib_9v3t8f> Is there any more stream anywhere?
<Billaxle> .implying the ratings will EVER drop, lol
<CriticKitten> It'd make sense Nyst. He seemed to know precisely what was happening to all of them at any given time, so...
<Alexann> LOL
<DarkRook> lol
<Tovler> Maybe it was Pinkie's Earth Pony magic that allowed her hair to be straight.
<DarkRook> they won't
<NewDCD> 9do you guys get signal?
<Jigglysaint> I have a link
<Alexann> Hopefully
<FwriedWrice> who else would they market for if they use Star Trek's Q for Discord
<V> no
<mib_9v3t8f> Not till season 5
<DerpyHooves> omg the bronies and their wing boners
<DerpHoovington> um, is the brodcast off line?
<EmeraldVision> G7 mabye
<DSNesmith1> main screen stays off
<Tr0llestia|zzzzzzzzz> One thing, before I sleep.
<mib_9v3t8f> Yes
<mib_9v3t8f> it is
<EarthTwighlit> yeah but Euponytor, most of the episode was made before they knew of the Bronies
<BronyBrian> i drank a whole pot of coffe forpony
<DarkRook> not because of me. Maybe SOMEBronies aren't doing their part
<DerpHoovington> oh, ok then
<BronyBrian> no
<jayands> no I don't DCD
<mib_jto2qv> i see clouds
<Alexann> Speaking of wingboners...
<Billaxle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81gU8-oEwoc
<The_Browncoat> no
<Owlowiscious> Main screen turn on.
<Owlowiscious> Nope
<Euponytor> I find that difficult to believe, the bronies were out in force around episode.. what, three?
<FwriedWrice> 30 yr old trekies like me?
<Tovler> I see rainclouds
<EarthTwighlit> but still Q was freaking brilliant for Discord
<DSNesmith1> working on 27 hours of no sleep
<DarkRook> I like wingboners
<Alexann> www.facebook.com/RDWingboner
<DerpHoovington> oh holy crap that ep was awesome
<DSNesmith1> no stimulants whatsoever
<DarkRook> RD gets them whenever I get them
<DerpyHooves> xD
<DSNesmith1> JUST PONY
<Alexann> Like my page please =D
<Jigglysaint> actualyl that might have not worked out so well
<shadowLurker> we not get signal
<Nyst> he's not quite god-level yet, but in a world where magic is real, he's certainly as close as one can get. Compare to Celestia and Luna with god-level magic powers (raising the sun, etc)
<EmeraldVision> Sup Trollestia
<jayands> Eeenope.avi
<SlurryMoon> Now, someone needs to make a video of all the mistakes in Season 2 ep1
<RC> 0Is this bad if this video gave me a wingboner?
<EmeraldVision> im back yo
<mib_9v3t8f> 4Fancy.
<Trollestia|zzzzzzzzz> Sup.
<Jigglysaint> now that they know the adults like it, more fanservice
<Sol> Who's Q?
<RoboPlop> Seconded
<mib_ry7rob> Guess what, I was so tired I dreamt I was watching season 2. BUT I MISSED IT!!!
<DerpyHooves> ahaha wing boners
<CriticKitten> Pony doesn't count as a stimulant?
<ThePretender> DSNesmith1, you are true brony
<DerpHoovington> um, are we gonna watch Giant Robots now?
<Wizzardess> For a few scenes, it looked like Rarity was missing her cutie mark after she was hypnotised. That might've been an interesting twist.
<LordCelestia> Ponies are enough to stimulate brain waves
<SlurryMoon> I need to see that video...
<DSNesmith1> that episode though
<FwriedWrice> Q is the troll King
<mib_ry7rob> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<DerpyHooves> im a female brony? if that makes sense lol
<Trollestia|zzzzzzzzz> Bye, though.
<EarthTwighlit> Indeed
<DSNesmith1> just bumped Celestia down my power tier a bit
<EmeraldVision> No
<Jigglysaint> I have a feeling season 2 won't be "as good"
<Alexann> No. We will watch epic pony videos.
<EmeraldVision> none
<Billaxle> We missed S2! :(
<RoboPlop> Now we need a drawing of Twilight as Picard and Discord as Q.
<FlutterBro13> Poines == Simulants?
<DashWithRainbows> @DSNesmith1 try a week of that, i done it, you hallucinate about ponies if you spend most of your time watching them
<Euponytor> Q is a.. bigger troll.... than Celestia
<Jigglysaint> but it will be great for different reasons
<DerpHoovington> Pegasis
<Euponytor> I can't believe I just said that
<mib_9v3t8f> 4Yeah
<DSNesmith1> .... so
<mib_9v3t8f> 4sorry
<EmeraldVision> I fellasleep on the keybored
<DSNesmith1> if I don't sleep for a few days
<Alexann> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uWBHrhX3M
<Sol> No, it won't be "as good" because of nostalgia
<mib_niy2ko> dont worry you ididnt miss much.... just THE FREAKING BEST EPISODE EVER EVWER
<Nyst> CriticKitten; him being a puppetmaster (to the point of being literally protrayed as one) also suggests he's got an eye on everything.
<Jigglysaint> but the fear is that it will attract more scorn from Hasbro
<DSNesmith1> and watch pony
<FwriedWrice> yes.Troll KING > troll princess
<DashWithRainbows> stimulants such as energy drinks and coffee
<Euponytor> what Sol said
<Tovler> inb4 insomnia enduced stroke.
<EarthTwighlit> I have a feeling that it wont be "as good", itll be better!
<Alexann> I love that video
<DSNesmith1> I can talk to Fluttershy?
<NewDCD> just give me the go when you switch them all
<Wolfur> it will hit youtube in no-time :P
<Jigglysaint> Q is the original troll
<LordCelestia> sure
<Owlowiscious> ^Please
<DerpyHooves> Am i the only female here? im just wondering because every other person ive met that likes ponies is a male
<CriticKitten> Yeah, so omniscience makes sense.
<LordCelestia> lemme go get her
<mib_0ubwm4> anyone know where I can catch season 2 ep 1??
<DashWithRainbows> maybe
<Alexann> I'm s female
<Alexann> *a
<EarthTwighlit> hopefully
<Sol> Rewatching some of S1 showed me that there were some problems with a few episodes
<Owlowiscious> http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/17328113
<Billaxle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYaEITlCQRg
<DerpyHooves> YAY!
<jayands> No, Flutterbro13, (Ponies === Stimulants).
<Jigglysaint> he was troll'n before the internet was popular
<NewDCD> 9mib: we have a recordi-
<mib_niy2ko> im male but im also ponycurious
<NewDCD> 9beat me to it
<mib_z6uzrb> I'm female. :)
<LordCelestia> newDCD put a link
<Owlowiscious> mib_0ubwm4: Use that link
<mib_6snbuw> you're brain literally starts to stop gathering external data and in an attempt to hold your perception together starts creating things to fill in the gaps
<Euponytor> Sol there were SEVERE animation errors in some of the episodes
<Euponytor> I didn't see any severe errors in this one
<DerpyHooves> ponycurious xD
<DSNesmith1> that sounds terrifying
<EmeraldVision> So many ppl with no names d:
<mib_cj71xh> You gonna air the season 2 premiere?
<Alexann> My name should clue you in on that ;)
<DSNesmith1> and awesome
<DerpyHooves> i like ponyies
<FwriedWrice> I felt this episode had a REALLY fast pace to it
<shadowLurker> DSN, after that, you would be able to talko to flatershy while riding on RD to fight of a giant panda
<Jigglysaint> I fear the show might lose some of it's lightheartedness
<Sol> I'm not talking about animation
<Jigglysaint> it did actually
<Billaxle> Staght up Brony Colt here
<Euponytor> Fwried: Really? I felt like they kind of wasted time
<RC> 0@derpy: This is what you get for watching manly shows
<DerpyHooves> i first watched it with my baby cousin but then i started watching it
<Jon> Can the panda be on fire.
<DSNesmith1> but I know all too well that the fun stuff only comes after a day or two of feeling like absolute shit
<Euponytor> then again they HAVE to go fast
<EarthTwighlit> well flash cant be that easy to animate some of teh stuff they did
<CriticKitten> ....that sounds pretty cool to me. >_>
<Owlowiscious> Owlowiscious ninja powers activate!
<Sol> I'm talking about plot and characters and such
<DerpyHooves> i was like hey not that bad
<mib_6snbuw> so pretty much your imagiantion starts bleeding over into reality
<Euponytor> if they want to pack all this into two parts
<Billaxle> <--Glorious Stallion!
<Derp> Nah, I'm female too. :B Very tomboyish, but yeah.
<Maeni> new meme? victoryful
<Jigglysaint> yeah I see that
<DashWithRainbows> its awesome basicaly
<RoboPlop> Plot holes? In MY My Little Pony?
<Jigglysaint> it felt like they were sort of bouncing
<DSNesmith1> that won't be a problem until I call my professor Cheerilee
<DarkRook> I AM A MAN! A MAN MAN MAN MAN
<Euponytor> yeah, agreed, some of the characters kinda went slightly OOC at times
<FwriedWrice> near the end it slowed down but in the beginning it was ultra fast
<Alexann> I've never been really girly
<EmeraldVision> <-- Colt .45
<Billaxle> <---A.K.A "Bad Horse"!
<mib_6snbuw> lol
<Discord> Anyone up for a quick riddle?
<DerpyHooves> I uhh get called names but whatever ponies ftw right?
<ThePretender> AAAAAAAAAAH
<mib_6snbuw> oh yes

<TyeDyeBrony> YES SIR
<SmokeyTreble> Look Before You Sleep always felt a bit off to me
<Jon> Ok everypony
<jayands> lol
<Euponytor> and then they HAD to recap
<DSNesmith1> BRING IT
<jayands> sure
<Discord> Here it is
<DarkRook> hell to the yes
<Discord> "I lied at the beginning, Hated laughing next, I toke something that was useless, and was not nice about it. I left my friends and broke the rules. There's only one left and it's a snap. The two answer, but only one is right. " Who am I?
<Jon> You get up and go to school on monday
*Owlowiscious opens his wings
<Jigglysaint> they got to keep in mind their pacing
<Euponytor> they *HAD* to recap.
<DashWithRainbows> my body is ready
<Owlowiscious> COME AT ME BRO
<Derp> Ponies.
<Billaxle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN2U5wkhRWc
<Nyst> Isn't that like, god what was his name, so tired...that greek guy in the cave that couldn't tell what was reality and what were shadow?
<Derp> B] Awesome ponies.
<AgentShawn> Damn.. I knocked out.
<Jigglysaint> making sure the clothes are correctly facing
<Jake> so whens this thing start?
<mib_ozmk1v> Season 2?
<Jon> you have a teacher called Cheerilee suddenly
<Jon> WHAT do you do.
<European-Dude> hello?
<Alexann> I try to keep the brony stuff to myself and my friends.
<EmeraldVision> When i say Po- you say Nies
<Derp> I should really publish the results of that survey I did. :|a
<DerpyHooves> what is it they call pony high fives? brohoof? xD
<AgentShawn> I missed the new episode by an hour
<EmeraldVision> Po
<DerpyHooves> nies
<DSNesmith1> hmmmmm
<RAWRity> discord CELESTIA!
<Alexann> :brohoof:
<DerpHoovington> BROHOOF
<ponimypony> EAT CUPCAKE
<EmeraldVision> :3
<RoboPlop> Gotta mind those intimate details.
<Euponytor> and then they had to deal with corrupting five ponies
<DashWithRainbows> ask is she is a brony.
<BronythePaladin> idk
<CygnusRooK> omgomgomgomgromgomgomgogmogmomgomgomgomg
<DarkRook> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDHAp1zG7Y
<SAFR_> Paint her lavender and draw on her flank
<Sol> I thought the pacing for this episode was actually better than, say, Episode 2's
<DerpyHooves> BROHOOF
<ThePretender> Celestia?
<LordCelestia> Anything that has cloppy MLP characters is basically if you break the line between cute and porn and let it bleed out onto your computer screen. You don't know if it's the most fucked up thing ever or really freakin' cute. I try to avoid that circumstance.
<Euponytor> all in 22 minutes
<DashWithRainbows> if not then tell her to change her name
<Derp> And send ED a big thank you card, once I uh. Draw up the art.
<European-Dude> will they be playing it again today?
<EmeraldVision> Bruhuf
<DerpyHooves> brohoof anyone???
<Euponytor> because american ads are BULL SHIT
<Sol> Episode 2 was rediculously fast
<DerpHoovington> well, for bronies, I dont know what they would call it for pegasises
<NewDCD> dari you're just missing Twi, huh?
<Jigglysaint> but is it too fast for the girls?
<Euponytor> if they had 28 minutes or so
<Derp> brohoof! :o
<Discord> Let me know when You get it
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<NewDCD> 9guys brb
<Alexann> Pegasisters...
<CygnusRooK> when does season 2 air?
<Euponytor> they could have put more in
<Nyst> Plato's Cave. Thanks Google.
<EmeraldVision> Wing-slap
<Lasharus> I think part of it because they didn't have to introduce everyone. We KNOW the ponies, let's get to the story.
<Alexann> I don't like it as much as brony.
<Jigglysaint> true
<DarkRook> UR A MAN!
<FwriedWrice> true
<DSNesmith1> 1/0?
<TheDerpedOne> Hello?
<RC> 0pegasis souds better
<DarkRook> by man, I mean brony
<EmeraldVision> Hnnng
<EarthTwighlit> exactly
<Euponytor> but they recapped pretty hard here
<DerpyHooves> I always thought Bronies was a general term, gender didnt matter...
<Lasharus> (two people acknowledged me. See? I'm a genius)
<Jigglysaint> also I have a feeling that the 2 parter is more for us anyway
<DerpyHooves> at least thats what i was told
<DSNesmith1> um
<DarkRook> I like Brony. I just thinks it's gender neutral
<jayands> FFFFUUUUUUUU
<Lasharus> Sorry, couldn't resist. :P
<Alexann> That's what I think
<NewDCD> 9much better
<DSNesmith1> String or nothing
<prince-dari> NewDCD: All switched
<ThePretender> oh, it's Twilight!
<Jigglysaint> and the regular season is for everybody
<Alexann> Gender neutral
<RAWRity> Well, I'll be going you guys
<Euponytor> 2 parter? Don't you mean 3 parter?
<RC> 0brony is genderless
<DarkRook> ANYONE CAN BE MY BRO!
<Jon> Aww.
<Nocturne> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSrBbsSu4XI
<FwriedWrice> Anyone know when flankbook will be back up? I wanna post... stuff...
<Actazeur> Does anypony knows when episode 2 is out??
<EmeraldVision> LETS DANCE
<Lasharus> That's very much possible Jigglysaint. And Euponytor, stop pushing it. :P
<DerpHoovington> eh, I guess it would work
<Euponytor> another massive trollface.jpg
<Apokalipse> Sol check your PM's
<Billaxle> This is how i feel about whoever/whatever caused me to miss S2!
<DerpyHooves> I'm a brony and proud just saying lol
<Billaxle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozDvkBe2rdg
<Owlowiscious> Alrighty then

<Jon> I just was about to post a vid for us going into season 2.

<EarthTwighlit> Jigglysaint, you mean Everypony right?
*LordCelestia launches RAWRity out of the Chat room via the MOON cannon
<Euponytor> it's not like they're gonna tell us in advance
<Alexann> It's hard hiding this shit.
<DerpyHooves> my mom does..
<Cynder7> 6Hey! :D
<Jigglysaint> yeah
<Discord> Thats a answer but the the right one, ThePretender.
<Derp> My mom does. She's cool with it.

<Bjornfot> so, when is mecha gpnna start?
<LordCelestia> at least have them leave in style, heeheee ^^
<Bites> lol
<Lasharus> No, but I think they announced that it would be a twoparter. :P
<DashWithRainbows> lol at LordCelestia
<DSNesmith1> Fluttershy!
<RAWRity> well, that's quite the send off! Great night guys, even if I will be paying for it all day!
<Whixii> Harder than hiding porn <_>

<Alexann> It's 10:21
<NewDCD> 9make sure you have stream feed then
<Lasharus> I was astounded by the rating MLP has on IMDb, to be honest. :P
<Jigglysaint> I'll have to take a look when I get home tomorrow
<Ghosties> 4That's a good point, why the fuck was Discord propped up in someone's garden?
<sotha> I get it. You're Discord.
<DerpHoovington> simple question, the mod's mentioned yesterday something about giant robot movies, is that happening?
<DarkRook> 8:22 in good old COLORADO

<RC> 0 4pm in poland
<Jon> Discord better have something like
<RoboPlop> How many of us do you think there are?
<Jigglysaint> because if that's true, then Treehouse would be running them out of order
<NewDCD> 9is everyone ready?
<Lasharus> But all the same, I didn't expect it to nearly equal the rating of the GODFATHER.
<Jon> Celestia's bananas
<hero_spirit> Thank you muchly DCD :3

<DarkRook> Okie
<Discord> Your getting closer, that's one of my answers, but still not it.
<Nocturne> i'm responsible for converting several my friends into bronies
<DarkRook> lol
<VenomOPS> Venom OPS
<Jigglysaint> and if that's the case, then that means that it's possilbe to archive the entire season perhaps before it even ends
<Alexann> At least if I have to tell my mom sometime, it's not inappropriate or anything...
<Jon> Farewell season 1.Onto the future.
<EarthTwighlit> who knows, we're never all in the same spot except on EQD
<Euponytor> we had AT LEAST six FULL channels of bronies JUST HERE
<Nyst> I'm trying to convince a friend on steam to give it a try, but his reaction to is has been...rather allergic.
<EmeraldVision> Nine Twenty three in Chicago, illinois
<jayands> I'll click any mediafire link posted lol
<Derp> I converted two of my RL friends to the show
<Bittershy> hello
<DarkRook> I turned at least 10 friends online into bronies

<Derp> One of them was a dude, and I showed him the Fluttershy clip from Best Night Ever
<DarkRook> Discord trolled u
<Billaxle> i'm currently in the process of converting my freind
<RoboPlop> The channel I started on had like 5,000 viewers.
<Bittershy> damit
<sotha> Discord is the one controlling each of them like marionettes. Twilight is the only one left for him to conquer.
<hero_spirit> What are we firing up? :0
<ponimypony> KK
<Legato> whats going on?
<DarkRook> sorry
<Alexann> I've got my closest friends to watch the show, and one of them is converted.
<EmeraldVision> @darkrook i turned 17 of my Real friends into bronies
<Dermathil> just press play, NewDCD
<DSNesmith1> wow jon, thanks for that video
<Discord> One more hint, The mane 6 are the users of what
<LordCelestia> okay, ill post it in big red letters if theres any lag
<Derp> So he got curious and watched the rest. Then he converted his sister.
<Euponytor> Hah, my estimate was dead-on then
<DarkRook> I TURNED U INTO A STFU
<Tovler> is it working?
<Billaxle> its like pulling teeth, but it'll be worth it
<prince-dari> NewDCD: What are you doing?
<Rachel> Hi :) :)
<DarkRook> ;(
<Euponytor> 5k bronies was my initial guess
<BarbraStreisand> Just hit play bro
<EarthTwighlit> but you cant go to any forum without seeing at least one brony
<DerpyHooves> I'm attempting to convert my one friend
<Jigglysaint> wow

<Jon> You're welcome DSN.
<Bittershy> i couldnt get any sleep from the thunderstorm :( just woke up
<Derp> It was fun watching his reactions to the episodes. So much laughter XD
<DerpyHooves> I told her it was cooler than twilight and she said we'll see
<Alexann> One friend thinks it is stupid and my other friend is too obsessed with *shudder* DARREN CHRIS
<EmeraldVision> @darkrook its ok, its ok, here, have a cookie
*BarbraStreisand

<prince-dari> NewDCD: It's not playing

<EarthTwighlit> i know 2, close friends of mine
<Jon> thats bugging me.
<DerpyHooves> I think my little pony is cooler than twilight
<Jigglysaint> of course that's because I haven't been able to ask some of my friends
<Alexann> OH MY GOD A GIANT ROCK
<Alexann> I love that video
<DarkRook> Durr
<Jon> It makes me think my computer screen's dirty.
<DarkRook> obviously
<EarthTwighlit> One converted me, the other I converted with my friend
<LordCelestia> send that smudge to the moon, i must
<DarkRook> Twilight is retarded
<EmeraldVision> RAINBOW EMP INBOUND
<Billaxle> : P
<Derp> I basically showed him some funny clips from the show and then let him watch some episodes.
<EmeraldVision> HATE IS OFFLINE
<DerpyHooves> yes yes it is
<DarkRook> the movies/books, not character
<Jigglysaint> though I wonder if a person has the mind of a little child, if they are considered a brony or not
<ponimypony> LOL ANGEL JUST GREW LONG LEGS
*LordCelestia launches smudge to the moooooon.
<NewDCD> 9live!
<DarkRook> I like Twilight Sparkle
<DarkRook> she is my #2 pony
<Derp> He started with the pilot, but I know that it's not the most representative of the show. He enjoyed it, though.
<Nocturne> damn, i thought i was doing good with converting 5, but one of them is in a heavy metal garage band, so that gets a bonus, right?
<DerpyHooves> I like rainbow dash and applejack
<Alexann> Rainbow and Twilight are my favorites.
<DashWithRainbows> clicking play....
<RoboPlop> It seems most bronies I know of were nerds already.
<EmeraldVision> I like POnies
<Jigglysaint> like if your self concept is a 5 year old girl, even if you have massive cleavage, would be be considered brony or target?
<LordCelestia> LAG
<DarkRook> Rainbow Dash and Twilight are my favorites too
<Dermathil> AWW YES
*Ghosties 4is also clicking play
<EmeraldVision> in general

<pmv_is_best_mv> i just got here, whats this?
<Owlowiscious> AWW YEAH
<Jigglysaint> a brony is merely an older fan
<Owlowiscious> MECHA TIME, HOO
<LordCelestia> LAG
<DarkRook> mehbe
<Alexann> Do you have a crush on Rarity?
<NewDCD> 9obviously, the problem we had earlier
*GGgala hits play. Nothing happe--oh finally! yay
<RC> 0sure
<NewDCD> 9was the channel
<DarkRook> I might tell CNN though
<Billaxle> I like Rarity! : ]

<mib_3ere0h> a
<Jigglysaint> but older physically or mentally?
<NewDCD> 9choosing the WORST moments to lag like hell
<Billaxle> lolz
<Euponytor> jiggly: pretty sure women like that are part of the target audience, although not the *stated* target audience
<DarkRook> PSHAW
<DerpyHooves> the principle of my high school now comes to school with a brony T shirt on.
<Alexann> xD
<DarkRook> I like her too
<Rachel> ):
<DerpyHooves> I win
<RC> 0better tel FOX
<LordCelestia> Still a lil bit oflag
<Ghosties> 4DAT'S OWNCAST!
<Jigglysaint> right
<Ghosties> 4: D
<Discord> I'll have another riddle for everypony next week. It's time for me to disappear, I'll let my friend crono_flash take over in my place
<Yu_Kigono> Mazinkaiser SKL is ok, but I prefer normal Mazinkaiser
<RoboPlop> I'd say that older physically.
<ThePretender> owncast is worst cast
<DarkRook> Rarity is good, she's just my least favorite of the mane 6
<Alexann> Lucky you, DerpyHooves.
<RC> 0They loooooove ponies
<DerpyHooves> lol
<Jigglysaint> so physical age then
<BarbraStreisand> no, i think the worst moment to lag like hell would've been during season 2 ponies
<EmeraldVision> Who wants a cookie?
<Alexann> My school would think it's "gay"
<DerpyHooves> i got caught on youtube at school
<Billaxle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXqPeKrxBjg
<GGgala> oh OwnCast... you were so tempting with your high resolution capabilities
<Nocturne> of the main cast i like pinkamina diane pie the most :D
<mike> well that was fun
<DerpyHooves> and he told me to show him what i was on
<DarkRook> Pinkie Pie
<Jigglysaint> because I know a severely mentally challenged woman who would love this stuff
<DerpyHooves> and then he said i like this
<DarkRook> we just call her Pinkie Pie
<Alexann> Ponies?
<TyeDyeBrony> I'm so going to be ready for that next riddle
<Nyst> I like all ponies. Choosing a favorite is hard in that it implies I like any of them less.
<DashWithRainbows> broadcast offline :l
<Jigglysaint> if she hasn't already started watching it
<Konngman> PONIES
<CriticKitten> Same. :(
<Konngman> WHENS THE NEXT STREAM
<DerpyHooves> now he has a pinkie pie bobble head and a brony t shirt
<Euponytor> discord might scar her too
<Owlowiscious> Broadcast offline.
<RoboPlop> It's harder I think to market to the mentalities of individuals unless they are already established.
<DerpHoovington> all ponies are best ponies
<Jigglysaint> maybe
<Alexann> Damn
<EmeraldVision> HURR I wonder what Dr. Whoof humanized would look like :p
<RoboPlop> Say, scifi fans.
<DarkRook> Pinkamena is just the term we use for :( Pinkie. WHO WILL FUCK UR SHIT UP
<Alexann> Dr. Who
<Pinkamena> so many people coming and going
<Alexann> LOL
<Pinkamena> x_
<Jon> How is raven like a writing desk?
<Pinkamena> x_x
<DerpyHooves> dr whooves lol
<Euponytor> they need to start making discord toys now
<EarthTwighlit> These starting episodes for both seasons are a bit dark
<Alexann> I know
<Jon> Thats the only riddle I know.
<crono_flash> How did everyone like my friend Discord's riddle?
<RoboPlop> Little girls are just that, little girls.
<Billaxle> I'm waiting here for when S2 is on Youtube Konngman.
<Jigglysaint> but the new season isn't out in Canada yet
<EarthTwighlit> but i like em
<DerpyHooves> I LOVE DERPY <3

<EmeraldVision> WOOOT
<ThePretender> DAMMIT, FREEZEFRAME I WAS GONNA SAY THAT
<DarkRook> U A DICTIONARY?
<Jigglysaint> yeah
<EarthTwighlit> theres a poor recording somewhere

<Nocturne> shhhhhh i'm watching ponies :D
<Sol> Hey guys, no ei label for this epi
<Jigglysaint> creativity does work well within limits
<EarthTwighlit> yeah
<RoboPlop> So some things like this episode make me wonder what the lines are.
<Rodman> Well, Discord is fucking awesome, hands down
*ThePretender laments being too slow.
<DashWithRainbows> you want link?
<EarthTwighlit> about an hour ago
<Euponytor> jesusnipples you're 1:30 late
<Jigglysaint> so that only means that the jokes need to be more cleaver
<BarbraStreisand> if that's alright with mods lol
<FreezeFrame> I need to look up those exercises the director told me about
<Jigglysaint> no easy way out
<DashWithRainbows> only will post link if mods say its ok

<EmeraldVision> THE BUTTERFLYS
<FlutterBro13> O.O
<EmeraldVision> THER IN MEA TUMMAH
<sotha> I think it would have been cool for Discord to talk in Shakespearian meter.
<Sol> If all of S2 has no ei, it will be interesting
<DarkRook> indeed
<Jigglysaint> after all, that's where part of the charm is
<DarkRook> this was fast
<DarkRook> I approve
<Jigglysaint> that it's not like other cartoons
<mib_5o01fq> Well...at least in my timezone?
<EarthTwighlit> you can find a recording somewhere
*DarkRook brohoofs whoever made this

<Jigglysaint> in 3.5, it was changed to a plate of fruit and a glass of milk
<mib_hk3utn> anybody know the link to the first part of the ep on youtube?
<LordCelestia> good luck with the streaming NewDCD and everyone else

<Jigglysaint> it's like cookies was Rule 34 incarnate
<Rodman> Well, Discord did NOT disappoint. AT ALL!
<RoboPlop> The show itself is over-the-top sweet. Why would a plate of cookies scare anyone?
<Nyst> Corn? This is the first time I've seen AJ harvest something other then apples
<ProfesorRod> FLIPPING SWITCHES
<EarthTwighlit> but thats much less disturbing than a plate of cookies
<Jigglysaint> bingo
<Rodman> He is FUCKING AWESOME!
<NewDCD> 9Is it running?
<MakerDusk> yup
<SlurryMoon> Yes
<NewDCD> 9well?

<Alexann> DAMN YOU PINKIE
<Patrtap> Giant robot time?
<shadowLurker> maybe if I close the window with chat..
<RoboPlop> And not tv babysitting.
<Jigglysaint> but yeah, it just bugs me that food gets censored in a cartoon
<jayands> lmao.
<Tovler> The pop-up thing again? Oh well
<MakerDusk> lol
<Euponytor> Real parenting: when your dad explains to you who Q is
<SlurryMoon> insertion ho!
<MakerDusk> prepare for insertion...
<Jigglysaint> yes I am aware of the obesity epidemic
<jayands> brace your sphincters for secret butt fun.

<SAFR_> ^
<DarkRook> He MISSED U CELESTIA
<Jon> 66 hours till 2?No wonder these guys are so down.
<DarkRook> NOW TROLL WITH HIM, FOREVER
<NewDCD> 9BRACE YOUR SPHINCTERS is now a meme
<DarkRook> and ever, and ever
<Jigglysaint> in fact, my theory is that I wouldn't be obese myself if I had a better relationship with food
<DashWith_Rainbows> now i need to sign into youtube, and favourite episodes for later reference
<MAGNETOOOOO> What's going on? Season Two should already be up, right??

<DarkRook> Guys, someone needs to do that Applejack lying part with LA Noire music and stuff.
<ThePretender> aaaaaaaaaaaaah
<Jon> Octagon is wisdom and garen is courage and kiba is power.
<Combustiblelemons> bronystate wasn't working for me during the episode D:
<DarkRook> I will give whoever does that all the internets
<Jon> It makes sense now.
<jayands> The Octagon? WHY haven't we seen Rampage Jackson?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10So you guys getting skylanders?
<Tovler> Lagging harder than a Lagomorph with Long Legs
<Cynder7> 6I'm so happy! Oh so happy!
<Rafasde> "Not at all, I AM weak and helpless and I appreciate they understand."
<ThePretender> nope, Kiba is courage
<Discord> Hello shadowLurker
<Abbey1053> 14I might get skylanders
<ThePretender> because it's Link's VA
<Jason> Aristeo: Someone thought it would be funny to fuck around with my DNS settings :3
<Jon> Courage is a good guy one.
<Bjornfot> i'm having major lag and getting disconnected every now and then
<Abbey1053> 14or wait for the next game, it depends
<Jon> so Kiba is a good guy?
<ThePretender> ...no idea
*Aristeo bops Jason
<Cynder7> 6Idk yet..I'll wait and see what it's like when it comes out and maybe I'll get it when the price goes down..
<Jon> ...Link has a voice
<Discord> From know, crono_flash will RP as me
<Jon> I thought his voice was
<Jon> AAAHH!
<Jon> HAAAA!
<Jon> AAAHHHNG!

<shadowLurker> say, Discord, whow is it to be an incarnation of chaos?
<Billaxle> THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME!@ : d

<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10Hey Uxie guess what
<Jon> ...*wonders what it like to voice link*
<Combustiblelemons> I mean he didn't even need to talk to them
<Tovler> Zelda said "NOO!" In Japanese in Spirit Tracks
<Jon> Ok so we're paying you $500
<Discord> It wouldn't be a fun game if I just told you
<NewDCD> 9ELEMENTS OF HARMONY, MOBILIZING
<Billaxle> i FREAKING LOVE Discord!!
<Combustiblelemons> just touch their brains and BAM.
<Jon> We need you to scream as loud as you can random things
<Jon> but not words.
<SlurryMoon> shadowLurker its not "chaos" you Scootaloo
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10Turns out Aura's been on the spyroforums for some time
<Discord> What elements? I took care of five.
<ThePretender> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Abbey1053> 14-dances-
<Combustiblelemons> I guess he's just a troll like that
<Cynder7> 6The joy Facebook may bring. ^^
<Jon> Question?Why not disarm twilight first?
<Jon> The leader?
<NekoGamer> Oh god
<NekoGamer> WHY
<NekoGamer> I MISSED EPISODE ONE

<MrChang> we're finishing up char sheets in D&P room

<Jon> Also what if pinkie just devolopes a dark sense of humor?
<NekoGamer> *gone watching*
<UxieLover> 11I know
<Billaxle> I WILL BE READY!!!
<Jon> Then you have 2 elements to worry about discord.
<Abbey1053> 14look at the lighting of the pic or something
<NewDCD> 9DYNAMIC ENTRY
<Discord> Because The element of magic is a mystery, and It's powered by friendship
<ThePretender> and there's a recording somewhere (link, NewDCD?)
<Combustiblelemons> ohai dcd
<UxieLover> 11She did some editing three weeks ago
<Jon> And the dark sense of humor?
<Natleyn> This fucking anime.
<PinkPearl> ...
<Jon> did we account for that?
<NewDCD> 9Pretender: just click the LQ Stream popup
<Tovler> Nani sounds way cuter than WUT.
<NewDCD> 9ROCKETTO PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCH
*Natleyn hugs NewDCD
<ThePretender> well, there you go NekoGamer, it's the LQ Stream Popup
<CriticKitten> Jon: I can see that now. Pinkie: "You wanna know how I got this cutie mark?"
<PinkPearl> HELLO ALL BRONIES.

<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10well it looks like shes been here for longer then that
<Poots> Streams are up on YouTube!

<PinkPearl> swedish*
*Discord taps PinkPearls shoulder and quickly disappears
<Billaxle> Just be sure to turn up the volume, no joke
<Combustiblelemons> I see bronystates had a revamp >.>
<Tovler> Boobs on a mech are extremely useful.
<Billaxle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkJeCjMq4w

<Jon> He got killed.
<ThePretender> THOSE ARE NOT MEN
<Discord> Damn
<shadowLurker> wait... they are fighting...
<shadowLurker> for GIRLS?
<CC> Hey
<Combustiblelemons> what? discords manipulating them
<DashWithRainbows> i guess so
<Cynder7> 6It looks pretty real..It's nothing really..It's just I've found this classmate that I haven't seen for 8 years and it's kinda hard to believe that put on so much weight..
<NewDCD> 9BIG MACINTOSH DOES REQUESTS
<Rafasde> I don't know... the episode seemed a bit "rushed" to me.
<spazz> Downloads are up! http://goo.gl/D092H
<DashWithRainbows> wow....
<DSNesmith> lol at light gun controls
<ThePretender> Tomokazu Sugita is A BOSS
<Tovler> Sorry girls, we have too many male mechs. You can't battle.
<Combustiblelemons> yeah I had that feeling too :/
<Dermathil_> Where is Mazinger Z?
<DashWithRainbows> not even 2 hours and a download is up
<NewDCD> 9DAT RELOAD
<DSNesmith> TOTALLY RIPPED FROM EQUILIBRIUM
<Combustiblelemons> like they were trying to cram too much into a short time space
<rubenflonne> what a traumatizing experience to watch someone get stepped on in front of her and have blood splatter
<jayands> http://www.bakabt.com/160344-mazinkaiser-skl-ova-720p-h264-ac3.html
<Dermathil_> EPIC RELOADING SKILLZ
<UxieLover> 11Yes
<Jon> Discord?Question 41261.Would you accept pinkie as servant?
<Natleyn> Thanks spazz !
<Rafasde> Yep
<CriticKitten> ._.
<DSNesmith> Christian Bale did it first
<jayands> bakabt for mazinkaiser
<ProfesorRod> SWEET
<Yu_Kigono> Hmm, where is the mecha streaming?
<Jon> Granted you would have to give her the element back for her to serve you though.
<Abbey1053> 14Oh her
<NewDCD> 9it's easier to get it from 4chan's /rs/
<Abbey1053> 14she's been here since like forever
*Cynder7 6continues to eat her chicken
<NewDCD> 9Yu: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
<Dermathil_> NewDCD: where is Mazinger Z?
<Abbey1053> 14chicken~
<Combustiblelemons> Hope all the S2 episodes won't be like that
<Tovler> Nope. The element of laughter could seal Discord's doom.
<Cynder7> 6:3
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10Yea
<Jon> "Whipped it out""Sword fighting"Ummm...Yeah...
<Abbey1053> 14and LOL 8 years is enough time to gain a lot of weight
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: this is an alt univaaaars
<Dermathil_> OH
<Dermathil_> ah
<rubenflonne> lol these subs
<DSNesmith> what is this?
<Dermathil_> Masinkaizer DSN
<The_Browncoat> Already up on YouTube, though.
<ThePretender> DAT 80'S HAIR METAL IN THE BG
<NewDCD> 9*SKL
<DSNesmith> never heard of it....
<Cynder7> 6xD True but it still comes a bit unexpected :P
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<DSNesmith> any chance of Megas today?
<Dermathil_> Gotta give credit, the animation is pretty sleek
<Derp> Well, I think it's due to the 22 minute timeframe for each episode
<rubenflonne> that be fun
<Jon> "I'm gonna headbutt you I'm gonna headbutt you!"
<ProfesorRod> MAGNETOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<CriticKitten> Tentacles?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10so anyone seen icy?
<NewDCD> 9ORETACHI WA
<NewDCD> 9JIGOKU DA
<Jon> They don't play Just cause?
<DarkRook> I liked it
<DSNesmith> no no
<DSNesmith> they kill stuff just cause
<Derp> But I don't think it's fair to judge the season just yet. Season 1's pilot didn't reflect the rest of the season.
<RartyForLife> Anyone here?
<Cynder7> 6I'm still happy I found that birthday card..A single last name,FB search,accept and then I found half the people I knew in Canada. ^^
<NewDCD> 9ORETACHI WA JIGOKU DA
<ThePretender> LIIIIIINK, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<MeteorVenture> how many people did this peak at?
<wingless> pumped
<Abbey1053> 14:O Cool
<DSNesmith> 1200 I think
<Dermathil_> 1200
<Cynder7> 6I've seen him on Facebook but not here
<Tovler> Poor Kibago
<Abbey1053> 14and nah haven't seen icy
<DSNesmith> we will NEVER top that record
<Derp> I enjoyed it, too. Discord is a fun villain.
<Dermathil_> yeah
<MrPoniator> I think I saw it almost up to 1300?
<Jon> So...Spike and big mac just murdered like 54003156 people.
<DSNesmith> unless somehow next week draws more people
<DarkRook> I thought the exposition dump wasn't great, but right after that it got really awesome.
<Jon> thoughts?
<Dermathil_> we broke everything with that record
<DarkRook> I loved Flutterbitch
<Natleyn> NEEDS MORE COMBAT PORN
<Dermathil_> the chat, the stream...
<Cynder7> 6Meh..He's probably watching season 2 of the ponies..
<Yu_Kigono> grr, stream, why won't you play?
<Skippy2> I watched the ep on cable so I wasn't here when it peaked
<MeteorVenture> nice thanks:D and it probably would have been more if anyone could get in lol.. at least me and a couple friends couldn't
<Veewave> Was that 13 minutes?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10meh
<Tovler> People will be Jonesing for episode 2 next week since Luna makes a cameo in it.
<MeteorVenture> i could still see the stream though
<Real_Discord> Apparently There is one thing that can defeat me. Damn the person the who registered my real name
<DSNesmith> trolololo
<UxieLover> 11LOL
<DSNesmith> your real name is Q
<DSNesmith> you're not fooling us
*ThePretender laughs at Real_Discord
<Xeross> It was like 1200 and then it suddenly dropped back to 700
<NewDCD> 9SEARCH AND KILL
<PinkPearl> RANDOM QUESTION TIME: Who's your favorite pony ?
<ThePretender> Twilight
<Jon> Fluttershy?
<MakerDusk> the max users on the irc network peak at 1437 users today
<DSNesmith> new favorite pony is discord
<Xeross> Fluttershy
<NewDCD> 9Twi
<mib_9vpmrc> Pinkie Pie!
<wingless> Twi
<Darf14> Rainbow Dash
<Skippy2> Rainbow Dash
<Sol> Wow, managable numbers again
<Jon> Question?
<PinkPearl> A.J
<Natleyn> Every pony is favorite pony
<Rafasde> The episode looked like a fanfiction to me... sort of.
<Cynder7> 6I found this so damn lolsome. crazy, my good friends brother one time got super hammered and woke up in a bush the next day foaming out the mouth god damn he must have drank alot.. lol he also said some random guy went up to him and put a zebra blanket on him
<Jon> Can someone find me some fanart?
<Sol> A beautiful sight
<Tovler> In real life or on MLP:FIM?
<Jon> That has Dr. Horrible as a pony?
<Sol> So much bluetext though
<Jon> I would give them so many cupcakes.
<CriticKitten> Pinkie Pie. :D
<PinkPearl> mlp
<PinkPearl> (:
<MeteorVenture> i pretty much like everypony.. don't got favorites
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 10XD
<CriticKitten> Though for real life, the obvious pick is Magneto as best pony.
<Jon> I'm hoping S2 makes AJ more interesting.
*Teslaman SHIT I FELL ASLEEP
*Teslaman Dammit.
<Jon> To be honest not much in season 1 for her stuck out too much to me.
<PinkPearl> are Derpy named Ditzy doo? i can't remember x3
<Jon> Derpy doesn't have an offical name yet.
<Tovler> Applejack is best pony. I like how she harvests corn.
<FreezeFrame> Derpy has 3 fanon names
<Jon> Why was she harvesting corn?
<Abbey1053> 14LOL
<FreezeFrame> Derpy Hooves, Ditzy Doo, and Bright Eyes
<PinkPearl> Jon: okidokiloki! xD
<Jon> I thought she did apples?
<NewDCD> 9because THE IMMORTAL GOD MACHINE SETS THE WORLD FREE
<RC> 0That's becouse it's much darker than it used to be
<Patrtap> Freeze Frame: Don't forget Bubbles
<Skippy2> how long is this series?
<MeteorVenture> bright eyes? i don't know if i've heard that one yet
<ThePretender> Derpy is her semi-official name
<DarkRook> Agreed
<RC> 0The show i mean
<DarkRook> I like the new darker direction
<Patrtap> I swear she was called Bubbles
<Rafasde> Yeah
<Jon> Bright eyes was her sketch name
<RC> 0I like it too
<ThePretender> YES, newDCD, THAT IS THE BEST LINE
<PinkPearl> I haven't hear Bright eyes either...
<MrChang> espy
<PinkPearl> (:
<MrChang> you there?
<Jon> Different subbers!
<FreezeFrame> I've seen Bright Eyes in a few fics, too.
<Jon> I see.
<Jon> I like Derpy.I know it'll never be offical but.
<Tovler> did she died?
<Jon> Yeah.
<MeteorVenture> what sketch?
<PinkPearl> WHAAAT,
<DarkRook> I know the CMC Crusader scene could have been cut, but I found it really funny
<PinkPearl> Derpy did not die,
<NewDCD> 9Himiko = Trixie
<NewDCD> 9you can't unsee
<PinkPearl> or what do yah mean?
<ThePretender> but, Derpy is what they call her in the studio
<Jon> The Lauren Faust Sketches.
<Jon> For the charities.

<thunder-colt> DSNesmith: same here

<PinkPearl> I go Luna! 8D
<RC> 0The keep perfect balance between the darker parts and the cuteness of the original
<DashWithRainbows> Goodnight DSNesmith!
<Derp> I think the dark direction is just for the pilot, though. And IIRC, Lauren actually did work on the first two episodes.
<Cynder7> 6I CAN'T EFFING RIGHT-CLICK. DAMMIT. ._.
<DSNesmith> guess I'd better go before I pull a Spike and *zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz*
<Jon> 2 random dudes in a giant robot show up and murder everyone they see attacking you
<rubenflonne> i was partying with luna all night
<Natleyn> Go get some well deserved sleep, DSNesmith!
<Jon> violently
<DashWithRainbows> or good morning to be correct....

<Cynder7> 6Nah..It's slowly dying.. ._.
<NewDCD> 9Kaidou with a knife = takes out a bunch of guys with assault rifles
<NewDCD> 9fuck yeah Mech Pilot Spike you're the best ever
<Tovler> wow, she beat 1 guy. What an athlete.
<Jon> I forget
<DashWithRainbows> watching the Equestria online stream that was mad eyesterday....

*True_Discord makes it rain chocolate milk
<DarkRook> I just love Discord

<DashWithRainbows> she is a bad sniper
<grey> yes
<Teh_Sora> agreed
<RC> Trollestia said that it was only the matter of time
<Dermathil> Dash: she's an excellent sniper.
<RC> or something like this
<Dermathil> He's just an awesome dodger.
<Shutterfly> so is nothing streaming or is my internet being weird
<DashWithRainbows> she got noticed from that distance
<Shutterfly> it says showtime up top
<Dermathil> TWO FACES
<grey> luna + shineing gundam
<RC> I have problems understanding magic -gibberish
<DashWithRainbows> didnt even bother with the slightest bit of camo
<Cynder7> 6brb
<Teh_Sora> well, yeah, but if those three werent fighing in the meantime, he wouldn't have taken his powers from their chaos
<NewDCD> 9...I feel like grabbing my Gurren Lagann Revoltech action figure
<Dermathil> DO IT
<Dermathil> DO IT FILLY
<grey> hmmm apple jack + impulse gundam?
<Teh_Sora> it's just my guess, though
<Elky> CUNNONBALL AHTTAAAAHHCK
<Teh_Sora> wait, that sounds good
<ThePretender> I'm so jealous newDCD
<Flutteryay> Viral's voice is also Link's
<Flutteryay> you can totally hear it
<DashWithRainbows> laser nuke!
<NewDCD> 9I got it for real cheap
<NewDCD> 9 10 bucks
<Shutterfly> new episode was good
<grey> no apple jack + shin musha gundam
<RC> (Am I just discussing a plot of MLP with fellow adult male?)
<Elky> new episode was AMAZING
<Flutteryay> yup
<Shutterfly> I hate being massively cliff hangered by 2 parters though XD
<ThePretender> I have a Revoltech, but I never saw the anime it was from
<grey> apple jack + shin musha gundam + win
<Shutterfly> once i see part 2 ill probably be more excited
<Teh_Sora> if by adult you mean over the age of 21, then nope
<grey> ===awsome
<ThePretender> in retrospect, I should've gotten a GL one
<Shutterfly> also is the stream working right now?
<DSD> 10ok so i got SSA Abbey has AHT and Cynder has YOTD
<NewDCD> 9Shutterfly: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
<Shutterfly> NewDCD: why?
<Dermathil> that's the stream
<RC> Nah, I mean adult in general. You're not 5 or 6 are you?
<NewDCD> 9because Owncast is being a bitch
<Shutterfly> NewDCD: why do they keep switching XD
<Shutterfly> oh ok
<Elky> >mfw simon is fucking useless
<Shutterfly> wait are we watching anime? is a win
<Dermathil> Elky, wait for it. Simon is Fucking badass.
<Elky> hm
<Elky> we'll see
<grey> *goes out and buys another shin musha gundam and repaints in apple jack colors
<Dermathil> yes. You'll see.
<RC> majority of countries set majority at 18 btw
<MrChang> she has a scarf

<MrChang> what?
<Jon> Simon starts out useless but becomes awesome.
<RC> i'm 22
<ThePretender> and when you do see it, it will be GLORIOUS
<Shutterfly> hmm its being really laggy
<MakerDusk> 21
<True_Discord> NewDCD, quick question? why did you guys start using Owncast?
<Jon> Think of simon like erika and kaminia like seth from fire emblem
<Bjornfot> simon becomes kamina in the end
<FlaschenJoe11> Remember the Fight Kamina vs Ganmen at the beginning?
<RC> if adult means that I have to stop watching MLP, then...
<FlaschenJoe11> Word of God said KAMINA WOULD HAVE WON!!!
<Darf14> Guns vs a giant robot...good plan
<Jon> Seth keeps his awesomeness all the time but erika becomes awesome aswell.
<RC> I'm planing to turn adult at 93
<Elky> chang: hipster scarf
<Dermathil> FlaschenJoe11: that is 100% true.

<NewDCD> 9is it lagging for anyone else?
<Elky> dcd: too mayn viewers?
<Shutterfly> NewDCD: why would they do that, copyright concerns?
<Elky> no
<FlaschenJoe11> Enki is so pimped out
<DashWithRainbows> no lag here
<True_Discord> not really
<Flutteryay> We should set up our own streaming website that doesn't bow down to fucking copyrights
<NewDCD> 9no idea
<Shutterfly> NewDCD: i dunno was being stuttery every so often now its fine :P
<MakerDusk> lol
<Darf14> nope, once the majority of the 1200 Bronies that were here left its running just fine

<Jon> instant best villian.
<Natleyn> ^6
<Natleyn> ^*
<prince-dari> It's from Gurren Laggan
<DeniedExistenceMobil> Best villain by far
<DashWithRainbows> i liked the part where there was ponies
<grey> that is distroy mood for unicorn gundam
<DashWithRainbows> @DeniedExistenceMobil for sure!
<prince-dari> That has the music ^
<LittleWill> 0 0I SPEEK DUITSE EN NEDERLANDSE

<NewDCD> 9GREAT GURREN BRIGADE
<FlaschenJoe11> Rainbow's part was just not fair! Either way she wouldn't have been Loyal
<Jon> Q's voice is good for discord.
<Icydragon> 12Reminds me of soundwave...
<ThePretender> GREAT BRONY BRIGADE
<grey> thats why celesta + unicron gundam is a bad idea
<DeniedExistenceMobil> FlaschenJoe11: I kniw right!
<Flutteryay> Oh god, episode 8
<DashWithRainbows> did not betray as she was mind-fucked by discord
<DeniedExistenceMobil> Know*
<Cynder7> 6Nah..believe me,I do.. :P
<Shutterfly> Jon: wait it was Q's voice??
<Darf14> who is Q?
<Revolver_Graphite> STEAL THAT BIG ASS GUNMEN!
<Shutterfly> best choice ever
<RC> I love the darker feel of the episode
<ThePretender> Q from Star Trek
<ThePretender> Cosmic level troll
<Jon> Yep thats Q.
<Dermathil> Q is a Star Trek TNG character
<Shutterfly> Darf14: he was an omnipotent cosmic troll
<Jon> Q is basicaly a god from star trek
<Jon> who trolls
<DashWithRainbows> i didnt know who Q was....
<Shutterfly> in star trek TNG
<Jon> all the damn time.
<Dermathil> ThePretender explained it extremely well
<FlaschenJoe11> He introduced the Borg
<DashWithRainbows> being honest
<RC> And they should stick with Discord for more than two episodes
<Darf14> Rarely watch Star Trek, so its good to know
<DeniedExistenceMobil> Dash was given a tough fallacy, although I know how she could have loopholed it...
<DashWithRainbows> @RC agreed
<GGgala> holy crap she was wearing clothes
<RC> seriously the only thing this show needs is a good male voiceactor
<Jon> I think the thing is dash needed to figure out that discord was bluffing.
<DashWithRainbows> such a good villain but puts a humour side to being more powerful than celestia
<Zephirdd> What I love about Discord
<ThePretender> clothes? Yoko? Pretime-skip? AHAHAHAHHAHA

<Flutteryay> AWESOME SONG INCOMING
<Jon> Ok...someone who can draw
<Jon> please draw that.
<prince-dari> So that was Gurren Laggan then?
<AssertiveFluttershy> that was gurren lagann part 1

<NewDCD> 9hold on
<NewDCD> 9dari
<NewDCD> 9is there anyone around to do the encore?
<Bjornfot> no dari there's another movie
<AssertiveFluttershy> that was basically the first 15-ish episodes
<prince-dari> So Kamina's hardly in any of it?
<Natleyn> prince-dari: Part 2 is even more epic
<Cynder7> 6Nah..I'll end up waking up at 3 am and getting in trouble for screwing up my sleep pattern so bad..Not that I would mind waking up at that time.. ._.
<NewDCD> 9if not, I'm proceeding with Part 2
<Flutteryay> Can we replace the MLP movie with Lagann-hen?
<Bjornfot> dcd we could do that after the 2nd movie
<NewDCD> 9also dari: first eight eps had Kamina in it
<AssertiveFluttershy> kamina is there in spirit
<FreezeFrame> Nope
<FreezeFrame> Bjornfot's trolling must stay.
<NewDCD> 9I'm not available at the time
<ctrlx_laptop> NewDCD, maybe. i was just going to ask if the stream is up on MU yet?
<ThePretender> and he's never forgotten, even after he's dead
<Bjornfot> let's see lagann-hen first, then BMN
<DSD> 10oucbh
<NewDCD> 9but it seems there's nobody to stream the encore
<NewDCD> 9so I could stream lagann hen in the meantime
*True_Discord Hopes that Euroshow doesn't happen
<NewDCD> 9well
<FlaschenJoe11> Episode 15 next then Lagann-Hen that shows the fight of Teppelin

<DSD> 10....
<Cynder7> 6DUDE
<DSD> 10ok
<Tovler> Even Discord would be shocked at the change in personality.
<Natleyn> Tolver: I have a feeling this is what Dischord does on his days off
<DSD> 10is icy ok?
<Jon> So question
<GabeMoist> BOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Jon> What crime did he do?
<Jon> My girlfriend just happened to go insane and start a doomsday clock.
<Abbey1053> 14xD
<Jon> Not his.
<Tovler> exterminating life so that the world is more silent?
<Jon> Fault.
<Cynder7> 6I guess...not.. o.o
<Backlace> "We don't get it!" Fans of any Gainax anime ever at the ending.
<NewDCD> 9they're blaming him for the whole "climbing unto the surface" thing
<Cynder7> 6PINKIE PIE IS CROSSING THE STREET!
<ThePretender> ahhh, good old P&SG
<DSD> 10was he ever ok?
<Natleyn> Haha, pentagon.

<ThePretender> what about Season 2?
<ThePretender> also
<Backlace> DISREGARD, I'M REALLY A DEMON
<ThePretender> VIRAL
<Jon> Viral is a...good guy?
<Abbey1053> 14The whole point that I got into spyro was that he was a dragon that could actually fly T^T
<Jon> sorta.
<StyxD> does any of the rooms work?
<Icydragon> 13Makes... sense...
<NewDCD> 9StyxD: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
<Cynder7> 6And you got that 10 years later. ._. And you'll probably lose it again in this game.. D:
<DSD> 10Bash is an earth dragon Drobot is a robot dragon Zap is a water dragon Cynder and Spyro are dragons Sunburn is a fire dragon/bird and whirlwind is a wind dragon
<StyxD> thanks
<FlaschenJoe11> EPIC YAWN
<GabeMoist> Viral right now isn't really a good guy, but he's not a bad guy
<Abbey1053> 14Drobot?
<DSD> 10well in the gameplay spyro can sorta fly
<Abbey1053> 14Seriously
<DSD> 10A robot dragon
<Abbey1053> 14That's lazier than Red.
<Abbey1053> 14They stuck D infront of it
<Natleyn> We saved his body
<Natleyn> We can rebuild him
<Natleyn> We have the technology
<Tovler> Season 2: Scanty, Kneesocks, and Brief I don't see it happening.
<Fuck_Yea> Steam Group? Fuck yea.
<DSD> 10yea
<Janfadar> but we dont want to spend a lot of money
<Backlace> Season 2 will never happen. It's been confirmed.
<DSD> 10oh and Camo
<DSD> 10the plant dragon
<Jon> So basicaly
<Natleyn> Just like megaman legends 3.
<Cynder7> 6Would it be stupid to write a message to this dude telling him that we were together in second grade,five days after I added him? ._.
<Natleyn> :l
<Jon> The earthbadguys
<ThePretender> I thought it was confirmed that Season 2 WILL happen?
<Jon> had war with the spaceguys
<Tovler> what a shame. Throwing away a franchise like that.
<Abbey1053> 14not really
<Jon> and the humans who took over the earth badguy's stuff
<Backlace> No. There shall never be one.
<Veewave> This is a bit different than the english explanations.
<Jon> are getting the blame for badguys stuff.
<StyxD> but wasn't it supposed to be Blade Runner? Or did I miscalculate time zones?
<DSD> 10nope
<Jon> What the fuck is this political bullshit?
<Cynder7> 6Ok,thx!
<Purple`Prose> Hi all
<DSD> 10Wow theres a dragon in every element
<Backlace> I think the seiyuu for Stocking quit, anyway.
<DSD> 10i got better name for drobot
<DashWithRainbows> its politics, i aint gotta explain shit!
<NewDCD> 9StyxD: we currently don't have the encore streamers available
<Purple`Prose> Hi all
<NewDCD> 9so this is basically making time (also considering we have no pony episodes today)
<Jon> I still say we just need to call link
<Abbey1053> 14I would except even Microchip but drobot....
<DSD> 10Super Mecha Dragon
<Jon> 3 weeks is enough time
<Abbey1053> 14LOL
<DashWithRainbows> @StyxD that and this movie is way better
<Abbey1053> 14Owait
<GabeMoist> BOOOOO! ROSSIEU
<Cynder7> 6Rofl It feels so damn awkward to say this..
<Tovler> This is retarde- (looks at Tea Party) ...oh
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: We could just stream the new episode until someone shows up. There's an HD stream on YouTube.
<Abbey1053> 14let's call him SuperRobotMonkeyTeamHyperForceGo
<Purple`Prose> How long until stream?
<Backlace> I'm mostly here for the lulz. I can't stay for the main event.
<DSD> 10Yes
<Cynder7> 6Oh hai,we were in second grade together.
<NewDCD> 9people wanted to watch this movie by popular demand xD
<Abbey1053> 14it won't be that awkward
<GabeMoist> This is the movie?
<Purple`Prose> Where's the stream at, if not here?
<Jon> HEY HEY HEY
<NewDCD> 9http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/

<Jon> NO ANTI SPIRIAL
<Abbey1053> 14he might be like "Oh, I barely remember, how are you etc."
<Jon> WE HAD A DEAL BITCHES.
<DSD> 10could be worse
<SuperBrony64> i am 12 wat is this
<Backlace> Blade Runner's good.
<Tovler> That reminds me, I need to watch Summer Wars
<Cynder7> 6The fail would be if you had mistaken the person and sent that to some random person xD
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Backlace> G1 is G1, I ain't gotta explain shit.
<DSD> 10yea
<Cynder7> 6Lol probably :P
<Abbey1053> 14LOL
<Tovler> Warning: If I get the A movie, I'll pick Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona
<SuperBrony64> It's a Spiral Power Shield! Of course!
<Abbey1053> 14They'd be like "....what the fizzle?"
<Cynder7> 6xDDD
<Jon> Simon and viral left to die.
<Backlace> We all live in a yellow submarine.
<Backlace> A yellow submarine.
<Jon> Wow.

<SuperBrony64> I'm thinking of suggesting Steamboy if I'm picked...
<Jon> Why did we save nia?
<Jon> We could let her die.
<Riders> Blade Runner = good. G1 movie = I'm scared
<SuperBrony64> Steamboy = Most Expensive Japanese Anime Movie
<RC> G1 melts your brain
<Veewave> Oh, Seamboy! That's a good one
<Janfadar> Im so picking Serenity for A
<Bjornfot> at least it's not G3.5

<Jon> SNIPER IS CREDIT TO TEAM!
<Cynder7> 6And it's impossible to search them up in general on fb..I don't remember the last name of the one and the other has an over-common name. ._.
<Tovler> Can Saving Private Ryan be requested if it already played during a special event?
<Bjornfot> Land Before Time is my A choice
<DSD> 10ouch
<Darf14> Dont shoot the messenger
<Backlace> Too big to be a sniper rifle.
<Elky> I doubt it tovler
<Abbey1053> 14xD

<Bjornfot> elky, she was an anti spiral
<Dermathil> Elky: Killing the Antispirals made her get deleted
<MrChang> gimmy?
<Elky> I guess clothes that obscured more than half of her body killed her?
<Dermathil> She held together through sheer willpower
<KanyeSouthWest> bullshit, simon IS god
<Gordon_Freeman> 12Wait...
<Gordon_Freeman> 12Who's who?seriously?
<Tiroth> There's a fanfic somewhere where Simon screws destiny one last time so that HE disappears instead of Nia.
<DSD> 4lets play
<Purple`Prose> He killed God and took his stuff
<FUNFUNFUNFUN> 6lol?
<GabeMoist> He becomes a hobo
<MrChang> they went from kamina the weird crazy guy to simon
<Elky> yeah, I'm going with my explanation
<KanyeSouthWest> simon goes off to become a space hobo
<LunaTheForgotten> Like a bawss
<DSD> 4um well i'm DSD

<AK-47> I hadn't even seen you became Friday when I became a gun xD

<Elky> ...
*DSD 4is a a mlg g\pro
<NewDCD> 9Kamina was always a supporting character
<MrChang> so they had to eliminate kamina
<KanyeSouthWest> basically a much more asskicking drill-themed doctor
<Dermathil> {{
<Tiroth> And end.
<NewDCD> 9he's what you call a Decoy Protagonist
<AK-47_with_Silencer> YAY
<LunaTheForgotten> These credits are awesome
<MrChang> kill him off for the prettier boy
<BJA> 14I WALK A LONELY ROAD THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN
<Elky> he's what you call a dmpc
*mlgpro 4picks up AK-47_with_Silencer
<LunaTheForgotten> I can't understand a word they say
<AK-47_with_Silencer> HEY
<Dermathil> MrChang, well he had to die because his death is what made Simon develop into that character
<KanyeSouthWest> well he died in a extremely epic, awesome way
<FlaschenJoe11> TvTropes ftw
<Tiroth> You know, I wish the films would actually get dubbed. Probably never happen, though.
<Darf14> I don't think they are going to show the epilogue
<LunaTheForgotten> I guess I don't have to sit through them
<KanyeSouthWest> and yeah, character development
<MrChang> i don't get giant robot fighting anime anymore
<Tovler> I can only hope for some kind of PSwG movie.
<MrChang> what happened to good ol Gundamn?
<MrChang> Gundam
<Dermathil> without his death they would've failed their first uprising.
<Purple`Prose> Gundam is Real Robot

<FlaschenJoe11> night Pretender
<LunaTheForgotten> BYE
<SuperBrony64> Looks to be an interesting movie night next week.
<FlaschenJoe11> some say discord made Luna EVULZ
<LunaTheForgotten> I'll pretend you're still here
<Tiroth> FlaschenJoe11 - Fluttershy. Talking didn't work, so he just brute-force dit.
<Tovler> I can't sleep now or my sleep cycle will be fucked
<NewDCD> it indeed is
<NewDCD> since I must leave now
<ValtheJean> ah, gotcha
*True_Discord Well I heading off, I'll catch everypony friday, and during my next appearance on saturday
<LunaTheForgotten> Bye Discord
<FlaschenJoe11> Tiroth: he's just playing with them. If he wanted he would simply destroy them all
<SuperBrony64> Later True_Discord
<LunaTheForgotten> See you Saturday
<Mehpie> Good bye Discord
<Rye> Hello Bronies!
<FlaschenJoe11> Night, Evil Doer!
<Tiroth> FlaschenJoe11: I know, but he actually HAD to for Fluttershy.
<True_Discord> Later
<disaidra> what's up with the stream? have i missed it? is it broken?
<FlaschenJoe11> because she's just incorruptible pure pureness
<Tiroth> Something like that.
<Tovler> FlaschenJoe11: Rarity because her fall seemed logical.
<LunaTheForgotten> BRB, guys
<DashOrCrash> I wonder what he'll do, or try to do, to twilight?
<Rye> Hello Bronies!
<DashOrCrash> or is the mind-raping over?
*LunaTheForgotten goes to do errand for parents
<Sol> Is it still at the dinkleburg?
<MissingNo> Hi Rye!
<Tiroth> DashOrCrash - he's already done it. How do you think she'll fare without her friends?
<FlaschenJoe11> my guess? not even close
<DashOrCrash> Touché
<FlaschenJoe11> Hello fellow Brony
*LunaTheForgotten comes back
<disaidra> *fluttershy whisper* what's up with the stream *hides*
<Rye> Ummm, the stream does not seem to be working? It just keeps showing a circle!
<DashOrCrash> It will end up like season 1's pilot:
<LunaTheForgotten> My stream just closed
<Tiroth> I don't think we're watching anything right now.
<DashOrCrash> she'll go after the villain on her own
<Rye> Thats going around and around and around & gets dizzy
<Janfadar> Wonder what how discord will change Twilight. Is the opposite of magic science?
<LunaTheForgotten> How do I get it back
<DashOrCrash> and fail epically
<Sol> Mine's been down
<FlaschenJoe11> even the backup stream is apparently down
<Elky> rye, disaidra: http://www.dinkypage.com/cronoflash
<Elky> it's offline right now
<Sol> FiM has crashed three streamers
<Elky> but if something's streamed, it'll be there
<Sol> >mi cara cuando
<Rye> Ok I will try the link... Thank you Elky
<FlaschenJoe11> seems down too
<Rye> Yea
<LunaTheForgotten> Damn, I didn't know friendship was that powerful
<disaidra> thankyou
<Tiroth> LunaTheForgotten - It's the most powerful force in the universe. With the possible exceptions of love and hot-bloodedness.
<True_Discord> Just remembered, Portal 1 is available for free download on steam, so if you haven't bought it yet go grab it for free
<Purple`Prose> Congrats bronies, we've broken the internet
<StyxD> so... is something else going to be streamed today? I'm here for the first time so I don't know what to expect
<LunaTheForgotten> Discord,I thought you left
<Tovler> Staying up 26 hours for a show that got uploaded on youtube in 20 minutes
<FlaschenJoe11> My guess is, either Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash will snap out first
<Rye> I just got done watching the episode on the DVR... Not going to say anything though, since I do not want to spoil anything to anyone...unless everyone here seen it already?
<Tiroth> I have,
<LunaTheForgotten> I have
<NewDCD> 9Oh God...
<NewDCD> 9OH GOD
<FlaschenJoe11> ep1 think yeah
<DashOrCrash> Actually, now that I think about it, didn't they all seem back to normal at the end of part 1?
<Purple`Prose> Styxd: Thre seems to have been some problems
<NewDCD> 9I just realized something guys
<FlaschenJoe11> WHAT'S WRONG DCD
<Elky> ?
<Sol> ?
<LunaTheForgotten> What!
<Nittany_Tiger> Storm Chasers starts next Sunday.
<Purple`Prose> ?
<Elky> ?
<DashOrCrash> ?
<Rye> Yes? NewDCD?
<True_Discord> I though I come back with some news on getting Portal 1 for free
<Sol> ??
<Sol> ?
<Sol> ??
<Elky> ?
<LunaTheForgotten> ???
<Sol> ???
<Nittany_Tiger> !
<NewDCD> 9>mfw I'm now expecting Simon to fully hijack Geass R2's ending in Saisei-Hen
<disaidra> i'm sad, i got the orange box a while ago, have hardly played any of it except portal, and now they're slowly making them free :P
<LunaTheForgotten> ????
<Elky> ¿
<DashOrCrash> ?!?
<Veewave> ?@?
<SuperBrony64> Nittany_Tiger: Really?! Sounds awesome!
<Sol> #
<Elky> ¿?
<NewDCD> 9"IT'S TIME FOR ZERO REQUI-WAIT IS THAT GURREN LAGA-"
<LunaTheForgotten> NOOOOO
<NewDCD> 9"LELOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"
<True_Discord> WEll portal is only free for download til the 20th
<Nittany_Tiger> I caught a tornado myself this year (possibly more).
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: So we watching Blade Runner or is that out of the question?
<Riders> Well it can make Code Geass any worse than it already is
<NewDCD> 9"LET ME SEE YOU.....GRIIIIT THOSE TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETH!!"
<LunaTheForgotten> NOOOOOOOOO
<FlaschenJoe11> he will be to busy fighting Anti-Spiral at the same time
<Purple`Prose> XD
<Veewave> lol
<Sol> We're watching Episode 2 of Season 2
<NewDCD> 9I can't stream it. I was hoping someone who could would be online by now...
<FlaschenJoe11> EVEN SIMON CAN'T BE AT TWO PLACES AT ONCE!
<Drummar> hows it going guys? :)
<Veewave> But he trys to save god in that one.
<Purple`Prose> Yes he can.
<LunaTheForgotten> Sol, I wish
<Tiroth> I, uh, don't think I'm familiar with most of the stuff you're all referencing right now... o.o
<NewDCD> 9Flaschen that will probably happen
<Purple`Prose> Simon can do anything
<True_Discord> Now I'm out
<Sol> Lauren decided to release it early for a day just for us
<Drummar> You guys like episode 1?
<NewDCD> 9before they go fight the Anti-Spiral
<Rye> So whats everyones favorite pony, I seem to like rainbowdash but I think apple jack comes in as a strong second... but then again Fluttershy has that cute voice. :)
<LunaTheForgotten> Luna
<SuperBrony64> Okay, NewDCD
<Purple`Prose> Rye: Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Fluttershy
<Tiroth> Rye: Toss up between Rarity and Twilight.
<Drummar> twilight RD and fluttershy
<DashOrCrash> I prefer Trixie, personally
<FlaschenJoe11> Luna followed by mane6, then Derpy Then teh rest
<Nittany_Tiger> RD.
<Drummar> i hate trixie to be honest
<LunaTheForgotten> Luna,Octavia,Scratch. My top three
<FlaschenJoe11> Trixie needs backstory
<DashOrCrash> I think she would be fun to mess with
<disaidra> pinkie pie or fluttershy
<FlaschenJoe11> then she COULD become likeable
<Rye> FlaschenJoe11 you think they were release an episode dedicated to Derpy?
<Drummar> i want episode 2 now i finished watchign epuside 1 #:P
<DashOrCrash> Trixie would say, "anything you can do, I can do better!"
<Tiroth> They ALL need backstory, really.
<Mehpie> I saw a backstory of Trixie in EQD
<DashOrCrash> and I'd be like "ORLY"
<FlaschenJoe11> As I said, my guess is, either Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash will snap out first and you?
<Drummar> hmm
<FlaschenJoe11> Rye: YES!!!!!!!
<DashOrCrash> and then I'd die
<DashOrCrash> how can she die better than me?
<Tiroth> FlaschenJoe11: I'd guess Rainbow Dash.
<Drummar> I think RD Will go to cloudsdale, notice something, element inside all the ponies will go BLAH and chaos guy dies
<FlaschenJoe11> SHE! JUST! CAN!
<Drummar> but the first one to snap out? Rainbow dash
<Elky> so the copy of portal will stop working after the 20th?
<LunaTheForgotten> No one dies in MLP FIM
<FlaschenJoe11> Discord for Big Bad!
<Tiroth> Elky: No, that's not how it works.
<FlaschenJoe11> FOR WHOLE SEASON
<Elky> you download it now, you keep it forever?
<Elky> nice
<Revolver> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-get-in-mah-belleh.jpg I WANT THIS!
<Drummar> shes the one with something she can notice, shes goign to cloudsdale. once she notices nothing is wrong, she'll snap out
<Drummar> the others are just reversed
<Tiroth> I got Portal in one of these free promotions, and it's still fine.
<MrChang> any streams on?
<Dermathil> link to the stream again please
<DashOrCrash> "for science?"
<SuperBrony64> Oh boy! New comic!
<Elky> sweet
<FlaschenJoe11> DAT IS RELAXO-ING
<Dermathil> it closed accidentally
<LunaTheForgotten> Revolver,So do I
<DashOrCrash> I smell a portal reference!
<RobotPinkie> What's this about Portal?
<StyxD> you need only to start downloading portal till 20, or complete the download?
<Tiroth> Apparently, it's free right now.
<Rye> prince-dari Got a link to that comic?
<SuperBrony64> Haha, not a bad comic.
<Nittany_Tiger> Apartment cleaning time.
<Rye> No streams yet
<Elky> I just hope I'm not downloading it only to have it vanish after the 20th
<FlaschenJoe11> that's the last muffin she will ever take
<Nittany_Tiger> Also, have to grade papers.
<FlaschenJoe11> Elky: there was once such an special. my version still works

<LunaTheForgotten> Good for you,Lord Celestia
<SuperBrony64> Parking Maid: "You can't park in a handicap zone" Guy: "GO **** YOURSELF YOU ****"
<disaidra> just a thought, is everyone a colt here, or are there some fillies aswell?
<Nittany_Tiger> But now you have to contend with the downburst outside.
<FlaschenJoe11> no spoilers for LunaTheForgotten please
<LordCelestia> im 16.
<SuperBrony64> People really are rude in Parking Wars...
<Tovler> Is The Baconing worth 12 dollars?
<FlaschenJoe11> I AM A STALLION!
<LunaTheForgotten> I probably won't get around to read it
<LordCelestia> Hey guys, this video contains a REALLY AWESOME FANFIC

<Tovler> that old thing?
<SuperBrony64> Haha, you really like that video LordCelestia don't you?
<LordCelestia> Why yes I do!
<Nittany_Tiger> That video.
<LordCelestia> Lunatheforgotten, i posted it a half hour ago and nobody listened. so theres nothing wrong with trying again
<LordCelestia> :D
<Nittany_Tiger> Respond to a nuclear bombing of a city by blowing up the entire planet. Seems logical.
<Revolver> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/memes-pushing-patrick-we-should-take-the-th-wall.jpg
<LunaTheForgotten> I've seen it like a 100 times though

<LunaTheForgotten> LOL
<LordCelestia> Well i didnt know that soooooooo what do u want me to do?
<LordCelestia> anyways
<LunaTheForgotten> I don't know
<Cranberry_Scotch> I can't help but think of an event in fanfiction that is similar to the beginning to The Return of Harmony, Pt 1
*FlutterBro13 pokes LordCelestia
<SuperBrony64> Hey guys, check out this video! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x8bZJPovUQ

<Nittany_Tiger> How long until a Chocolate Rain PMV? Now? Yesterday?
<LunaTheForgotten> I'll read it LordCelestia
<Cranberry_Scotch> I'll check it out
<LordCelestia> For anybody who cares: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d492spz
<LordCelestia> Theres only a prologue and part 1 right now, then an ideas list.
<SuperBrony64> I'm not doing the video because EVERYONE is expecting it
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a script, or at least should be.
<SuperBrony64> Even the CREATORS are expecting it
<disaidra> just found this nittany_tiger http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOorrsfUWK8
<LordCelestia> Tiffany Nigger? you racist.
<SuperBrony64> In fact, you could say the entered a time warp and are basing the chocolate rain part of the episode based off of a PMV spoofing those moments from the episode.
<LordCelestia> *re-reads*
<LordCelestia> ooooh
<LunaTheForgotten> Good song
<Nittany_Tiger> So yesterday.
<disaidra> there's another one, but this was the first one on the list

<Bjornfot> Smooze is best pony, though.
<FlaschenJoe11> and the villains have somehow more character depth
<LunaTheForgotten> I take that back Bjornfot
<Sol> Nah, this is more girly than anything else
<FlaschenJoe11> and one of them is just slime
<interior_gummy> is the babes in toyland the 1997 version with charles nelson reilly

<FlaschenJoe11> and the villains have somehow more character depth
<Purple`Prose> COMBINED
<FlaschenJoe11> and one of them is just slime
<Sol> G1 Rarity sounds like Bart
*LunaTheForgotten goes to fix some chicken tenders
<FlaschenJoe11> how are you more 1-dimensional than living slime
<DashOrCrash> Of course the villains are better at friendship.
*FlaschenJoe11 has at least some chicken
<DashOrCrash> they're witches, right?
<Riders> Somewhere out there, there's and alternate reality in which Friendship is Magic didn't happen. The one sliver of positivity that I can find in that reality is that we wouldn't find ourselves watching this.
<DashOrCrash> and friendship is magic...
<TrollightSparkle> SuperBrony64 Hiya
<Nittany_Tiger> I read Cupcakes while this was playing last night. Cupcakes was....interesting...
<LunaTheForgotten> Where have you been SuperBrony64
<Nittany_Tiger> She casts the one ring.
<SuperBrony64> LunaTheForgotten: Helping MetalRainbowDash with his channel
<Sol> THROW HER IN
<Purple`Prose> Saying the villians have more depth than the ponies is like saying that a pond is wetter than a desert.
<LunaTheForgotten> Nittany, Why did you read that?
<Nittany_Tiger> Curiosity.
<DashOrCrash> Nittany_Tiger if you want something even more "interesting," look up Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie on tumblr.
<Smooze> TREMBLE BEFORE ME
<SuperBrony64> Where are we watching this movie? I can't get the stream to work :/
<LunaTheForgotten> Good for you SuperBrony64
<Purple`Prose> Here comes the family friendly Cthulu abomination
<FlaschenJoe11> smooze needs own show
<Sol> YOU CAN'T STOP
<Sol> THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
<Nittany_Tiger> I've check up on Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie.
<Purple`Prose> FUCK LICKITY SPLIT
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie is pretty much the best of the "Ask X" tumblrs. It's so incredibly awesome
<LunaTheForgotten> SuperBrony64
<LunaTheForgotten> http://www.dinkypage.com/bronystate-theaterlq
<Purple`Prose> wait wait..
<SuperBrony64> LunaTheForgotten: Thanks!
<LunaTheForgotten> Anytime
<Purple`Prose> I think we missed something here.
<Nittany_Tiger> My forum avatar is a picture from Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie.
<floom> Smooze you need me!
<LunaTheForgotten> Smoozed
<Pinkamena> Oh while I'm here, I'm running the developer preview of Windows 8, does anypony have any applications they want me to check? I've got a folder of screens too if anyone wants them
<Purple`Prose> ...no, wait it's just bad editing
<Riders> I wanna see a JJ Abrams My Little Pony set in this continuity, ending with a cosmic reboot that sets up Friendshi is Magic
<Nittany_Tiger> Is it open to gaming?
<LunaTheForgotten> How do you change your name
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: If it's more intensive than StarCraft: Brood War, then no.
<smoozed> Dat bad voice acting
<Pinkamena> LunaTheForgotten: /nick
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm worried that Windows 8 will turn your PC into an Xbox 360.
<SuperBrony64> This movie…isn't really a movie. It's more like an extended episode.
<LunaTheForgotten> Pikamena,Thanks
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: As far as I can tell, it's just as fast as Windows 7 if not faster
<LunaTheForgotten> *Pinkamena*
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh.
<Riders> That's what all hasbro based movies of the 80s were
<SuperBrony64> Is the Smooze something nice?!
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: They've made a LOT of optimizations and it's running really well for me. Aero even works without 3D acceleration
<LunaTheForgotten> Yes it is very nice
<FlaschenJoe11> why can't we watch the rainbow sprite movie? that had a rocket horse
<Purple`Prose> Okay, I have to give credit
<Purple`Prose> The ponies have a good idea: Get to the castle. Good idea.
<Sol> DOS EYES
<LunaTheForgotten> You have to eat smooze to see how nice it is
<FreezeFrame> This is gonna be hilarious
<Nittany_Tiger> Does it run on older systems.
<Nittany_Tiger> Windows 7 actually runs worse on my PC than Vista.
<FreezeFrame> Those of you who didn't watch last night missed some of the best chat
<Sol> Bart pony is best pony
<SuperBrony64> inb4 Smooze song
<FlaschenJoe11> Mary Sue Megan
<Nittany_Tiger> More crashes w/ W7.
<LunaTheForgotten> PONIES!!!
<Sol> Ohey G1 Applejack
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: It's passable on a system with no 2D acceleration at all, which every system has nowadays, even the crappiest
<FlaschenJoe11> that'S horrible *smile*
<LunaTheForgotten> My middle name is danger
<SuperBrony64> Smooze song!
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: I can't comment on stability since it's pre-beta, but it's impressive for pre-beta. It's usable, and that's more than I can say for most pre-beta software
*Smooze can't be stopped
<Nittany_Tiger> Mine was built in 2007 at near state-at-the-art at the time.
<FlaschenJoe11> SONGNUMBER
<LunaTheForgotten> You don't take the Teenager
<GGgala> SMOOOOOZE
<Sol> >THat's awful >Is smiling while saying it
<Smooze> YOU CAN'T STOP ME
<LunaTheForgotten> But they take two little kids
<SuperBrony64> Nothing can STOP the Smoooooze!
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: Then it should run fine, though don't be surprised if there are radical changes made to it between now and release
<Sol> Best song
<Purple`Prose> I have to admit, they're actually TRYING to protect themselves
<LunaTheForgotten> We will find a way to stop you Smooze
<Purple`Prose> Sandbags and such
<Smooze> O U
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: http://s1191.photobucket.com/albums/z467/Windows8Screens/ <- If you haven't seen screenshots yet, there are also pics of brood war running without any graphical glitches
<Nittany_Tiger> I just don't want closed-platform gaming.
<Nittany_Tiger> Closed-platform PC gaming is a publisher's wet dream.
<Sol> I saw G1Pinkie
<FlaschenJoe11> TASTE THE RAINBOW MUTHAFUCKA!!!
<Pinkamena> How do you mean, closed-platform? You mean like Windows exclusive?
<Pinkamena> ...oh you heard the xbox rumors
<GGgala> And then the Rainbow was split into the Elements of Harmony.
<LunaTheForgotten> Take that Smooze
<Riders> Give him a taste of the Motherfuckin rainbow!
<Purple`Prose> Elements of Harmony: FIRE!
<Pinkamena> No no no, there's no xbox functionality in Windows 8, the UI is similar, but that's it
<LunaTheForgotten> Taste The Rainbow MUTHA FUCKA
<floom> Smooze you need me inside you...
<Nittany_Tiger> Making your PC run like a game console where you don't have root control of the PC.
<FlaschenJoe11> Elements of Harmony would have NUKED the Smooze
<LunaTheForgotten> I'll be back in a minute
<Veewave> SMOOZE THE RAINBOW MOTHAFUCKA!
<LunaTheForgotten> I have to go eat dinner
<LunaTheForgotten> Bye
<FlaschenJoe11> They imprisoned a GOD with it
<TrollightSparkle> Bye Luna
<FlaschenJoe11> Bye
<GGgala> i instantly hate the human boy even worse than Megan already
<Nittany_Tiger> So you're forced to use the software and play the game the way the makers want it to be played.
<Purple`Prose> Uh oh
<Nittany_Tiger> Unless you jailbreak it.
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: OH
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah. Like "Smartphones."
<Purple`Prose> ...DUDE! The Smooze didn't lose! It swallowed a weapon that KILLED A GOD.
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: Win8 is NOT closed platform. You can still run and install any valid windows program. All win32 applications install
<Sebiale> So, are the light colors indicators of how many people are in that room?
<Nittany_Tiger> Cool. So I can still code on it.
<Sol> olol
<floom> They forgot me :(
<Riders> Mother of the Year
<Nittany_Tiger> Though I mainly prefer Linux for coding.
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: One of the developer previews comes with the new software that would be needed to use the new Windows API
<Smooze> don't worry floom, we'll soon be together...
<floom> <3
<GGgala> incoming musical number
<FlaschenJoe11> SONGNUMBER
<Sol> lol XD
<Riders> Wow, what flip-flops
<FlaschenJoe11> Elements of Harmony > Rainbow of Light
<GGgala> Floom/Smooze 4eva
<Purple`Prose> And then Megan became Celestia
<Nittany_Tiger> There's another problem. Microsoft may close off third-party peripheral support like XNA has with 3rd-party controllers.
<FlaschenJoe11> Celestia vs first villain (forgot the name) Celestia wins
<Purple`Prose> Tirak
<GGgala> FlaschenJoe11, Dirak?
<Riders> Remember kids, Your childhood is not always better than the present
<FlaschenJoe11> thx
<Nittany_Tiger> But since it's going to be open, that shouldn't be a problem.
<Tovler> So, this is the Portal everyone's been raving about...
<FlaschenJoe11> Tirak vs Discord is no fight, it's a massacre
<Nittany_Tiger> Unclean pony! Burn her!
<GGgala> The Moochick makes another appearance? Really?
<Tovler> feels awesome.
<Nittany_Tiger> Discord would have a field day with G1 ponies.
<FlaschenJoe11> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: I REALLY doubt Microsoft would do such a stupid move. The advantage of Windows over OS X is that it works on almost all hardware. If Windows started limiting what hardware and peripherals could be used with it, everyone would flock to Linux and OS X more than they already are
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<GGgala> in this stream: Floom's GPY
<Nittany_Tiger> And Microsoft needs to make that known to the public.
<Nittany_Tiger> With Windows 8.
<Riders> In other words, one look at the Floom = FUck That!
<Pinkamena> The fact they're having a developer preview at all means they want MORE 3rd party support, not less
<FlaschenJoe11> Eye scream
<SuperBrony64> Windows 8 looks pretty cool. I might switch from Mac to that if it turns out to be awesome!
<floom> :(
<Purple`Prose> These two are basically PCs
<FlaschenJoe11> floom owns them both
<GGgala> wow the Floom has naughty tentacles
<Nittany_Tiger> They need to make the next XNA support third-party controllers instead of just XBL ones.
<floom> You bet I do
<Nittany_Tiger> *X Box 360 ones.
<FlaschenJoe11> yet there's still some in the bottle
<Pinkamena> SuperBrony64: I advise against buying Macs in general. OS X is fine if you're running a Hackintosh, it's a good unix-based OS, but the restrictions are killer
<Pinkamena> SuperBrony64: The UI of Win8 takes some getting used to, but it grows on you
<SuperBrony64> Pinkamena: I want to keep myself from paying $1500 for a new computer :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Build your own.
<Pinkamena> SuperBrony64: Then don't? Building your own isn't hard
<GGgala> oh look, it's Star Trek chess
<Purple`Prose> Oh hai Angel
<FlaschenJoe11> Vulcan Game Board
<Pinkamena> I built one last christmas, I had it up and running in a few hours with drivers and I was already downloading TF2
<SuperBrony64> They aren't as pretty then :3
<Riders> It's Angel's father
<Zephirdd> hay guys
<Pinkamena> Please tell me you're not about form over function
<Nittany_Tiger> He can't tell a person from a pony?
<Purple`Prose> "NOT AGAIN!"
<Pinkamena> I know, dude needs glasses
<Riders> How often does this happen?
<FlaschenJoe11> no wonder Angel's such an ass sometimes. his AU counterpart is being treated bad
<Zephirdd> So, what are next weeks movies?
<Zephirdd> week's
<FlaschenJoe11> SONGNUMBER
<Nittany_Tiger> You are a pirate!
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: You wouldn't happen to know any one click download managers that work with firefox nightly, do you? I want to get a Pinkamena folder together, but saving all those images is taking forever
<MrChang> attention to my adventurers in the D&P session

<Nittany_Tiger> Sorry Pinkamena
<MrChang> yes pinkie
<GGgala> >old woman who lived in a shoe ref
<MrChang> it does
<Nittany_Tiger> Hell, I could build one.
<FlaschenJoe11> you are made of Awesome
<Riders> I guess we know where Angel gets his snark
<Pinkamena> MrChang, you are awesome
<Nittany_Tiger> With some trial and error.
<Mister_Moojick> Poor Rabbit >:
<MrChang> yeah
<MrChang> but nobody is showing up
<MrChang> i've had to delay it
<Zephirdd> WOOOO Batman begins! :D

<LunaTheForgotten> Oh thanks
<Purple`Prose> er, people being race
<GGgala> would be way grimdark if they were the reanimated pieces of the smooze's former victim's bodies
<LunaTheForgotten> Good steering Spike
<SuperBrony64> After seeing this movie, I think we should all fund the effort to rid Smooze from our planet.
<LunaTheForgotten> Why is it so laggy
<Sol> What happens when you touch THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE?
<MrChang> espy

<LunaTheForgotten> Oh good grief
<GGgala> Sol, iknorite
<Sol> Why are their hooves clopping on the grass?
<RainbowScout> Sup
<Riders> LunaTheForgotten = I didn't say it wasn't. I just said the Grundels look like they failed auditions for it in pre-production stage.
<GGgala> oh boy Evil Dead time
<Purple`Prose> "There's no need to panic." *SUDDENLY TREE SPEARS* "NOW PANIC!!!"
<Sol> I'm gonna smooze you until you floom

<GGgala> AWESOME.

<Sol> GOOD PLAN GUYS
<FlaschenJoe11> i don'T know. i did play WoW once ago
<Purple`Prose> ....
<LunaTheForgotten> Laughter always works.
<FlaschenJoe11> this plan was STAY TOGETHER
<GGgala> ticklish Spiderses. what'll they think of next.
<FlaschenJoe11> we split and died
<Sol> Get a basilisk
<LunaTheForgotten> The element of laughter saved them
<Purple`Prose> Giggle at the giant spider monster...ies?
<Riders> The fact that this worked doesn't change the fact that it still the dumbest thing said so far.
<Smooze> SPIDERSES
<GGgala> oh god what, it was maintaining its web out of telekinetic projection?
<Smooze> THE SPIDERSES ARE TICKLISH
<floom> They're not ticklish they have an exoskeleton...
<Sol> ....how's it falling apart?
<Purple`Prose> Web spell
<GGgala> what is the point of being a spider-like monster
<GGgala> if you make it with magic
<Pinkamena> ...wow. Nittany_Tiger, you may be interested to know I ran the first portal in the VM with NO acceleration of any kind what so ever and not only did it not crash, it actually ran at 6 or so FPS
<Riders> It's like one of those hopping spider creatures from Ocarina of Time
<Pinkamena> Minimum settings of course, but still, not even 2D accel.
<LunaTheForgotten> I might have to suddenly go
<GGgala> Octoroks?
<Purple`Prose> ...Go Wind Whistler.
<Riders> Why does Wind Whistler sound like a Transfromer that would turn into a falcon
<Dermathil> heyall
<LunaTheForgotten> So if I disapear, know that I will see you guys next week
<Sol> Dis cut
<Smooze> there should really be flutterponies in G4
<Smooze> they're so delicate and sexy
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey Derma
<Nittany_Tiger> On W8?
<Sol> Rarity was a flutterpony
<Dermathil> what's the stream link?
<Purple`Prose> <Flutterponies> FUCK YOU, GO AWAY

<floom> no
<FlaschenJoe11> yes, let the queen welcome them without escort
<Sol> WHAT'S WITH HER EYES?!?!?!
<floom> except if they give us money
<Sol> No
<FlaschenJoe11> evil guys would kill her
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: Yes, on Win8
<Purple`Prose> It's everyponies fight
<Dermathil> So, what's streamed after the BMN?
<Sol> *ends*
<Riders> They have filly Flutershy's long legs too.
<Nittany_Tiger> Hmm.
<Tovler> darn Portal. I missed the movied.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd think good hardware would allow you to run Portal on VM efficiently.
<floom> aww yeah Smooze it's a scene with us in it
<FlaschenJoe11> Tovler: portal good?
<Tovler> It's amazing. A might easy so far.
<Purple`Prose> "Close your eyes."
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: Well remember, no 2D or 3D acceleration, and the maximum vram is 256 mb
<Smooze> YAY I OWN EVERYTHING
<LunaTheForgotten> Damn they're fast
<LunaTheForgotten> Smooze, You about to get owned
<Nittany_Tiger> I really haven't messed with VM myself.
<GGgala> Smooze, prepare your sphincter
<LunaTheForgotten> Get the Smooze Flutterponies
<Sol> Smooze, you're about to get floomed
<Smooze> ...why couldn't just teh pegasi use their wings?
<Purple`Prose> AIR BLAST
<Nittany_Tiger> Spray our musk on the smooze!
<Smooze> Flutterponies used Gust. It's super effective!
<Purple`Prose> BEHOLD MAB, PONY QUEEN OF AIR AND DARKNESS
<Sol> Flutterponies are air benders O:
<Smooze> Smooze fainted!
<TrollightSparkle> Such chat lag for me >_>
<LunaTheForgotten> They all die, The End
<Smooze> Witches has lost the battle.
<LunaTheForgotten> Suck it Smooze
<Smooze> :c
<FlaschenJoe11> RoL is back BITCHES
<Riders> Flutterponies: The closest thing we'll get to G4 ponies in the pre-G4 days
<Nittany_Tiger> Pinkamena: I once ran a program through an X-terminal once (Xming). I usually just used X terminals for accessing my school PC.
<Smooze> >sweet stuff
<Riders> Brutal Honesty
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: Oh you don't use the terminal much? I use it all the time
<Purple`Prose> TASTE THE RAINBOW, MOTHER FUCKEr
<Defeated_Floom> damn it
<Nittany_Tiger> I use terminals a lot in Linux and on my laptop with Xterminal.
<Smooze> maamaaaa

<Sol> Which one?
<GGgala> 'what the fuck is this shit'

<Nittany_Tiger> G4 spike would facepalm.
<Defeated_Floom> is my guess
<Smooze> YOU CAN HAVE DREAMCASTLE
<Smooze> WE HAVE A NEW PLAYSET NOW
<Sol> G4!Spike: dafuckisdisshit.jpg
<Nittany_Tiger> We had no plumbing in Dream Castle anyway.
<LunaTheForgotten> I can
<Purple`Prose> Entrust the whiney little bitch with the god-slaying weapon
<Tovler> OOOOOH. (my first-ish stumper in Portal)
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: WinSCP... isn't that for FTP? Or SSH?
<LunaTheForgotten> Is there a movie after this
<Sol> What a Mary Sue
<Purple`Prose> No
<Sol> I feel like watching the S2 premiere again
<Defeated_Floom> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/1c3f44bfec64ef28e083f8505e005ba4/59626%20-%20bronies%20ei%20meta%20show_ruined%20target_audiece%20this_fandom%20watermark.png
<Sol> I need to dilute the sugar
<FlaschenJoe11> cool
<Defeated_Floom> >mfw that image
<Nittany_Tiger> Pinkamena: Both, though I use it mainly for FTP. It can do SCP as well and a few other remote things.
<GGgala> Lisa Simpson! wat
<Nittany_Tiger> I use Xming for SSH.
<Tovler> Yeardley Smith?
<GGgala> or... Bart >_<
<Sol> Nah, I told you it was Bart pony :P
<LunaTheForgotten> Can we skip the credits? possibly?
<Sol> @Floom: yeah, I noticed that too B)
<Defeated_Floom> That's so awesome
<Bjornfot> oh well, i hope y'all enjoyed my movie pick http://i53.tinypic.com/6ds650.jpg

<FlaschenJoe11> smooze was defeated
<LunaTheForgotten> Toei Animation,Haven't seen that in a while
<Apokalipse> Bjorn I still hate you
<LunaTheForgotten> It was OK, I guess
<Sol> Bjorn, is that you?
<Apokalipse> How could you pick this movie?
<Bjornfot> yes sol
<Pinkamena> Nittany_Tiger: I thought so, I used it for FTP a bit
<Sol> Bjorn, I love you
<Riders> Thank You Bjornfoot. It lived up to my hype
<LunaTheForgotten> Bjorn, You troll
<GGgala> Bjornfot, it was everything i hoped for
<Purple`Prose> It wasn't bad. It had a few nice scenes, the villians were entertaining, and the Flutterponies made up for the faults of the main cast.
<Apokalipse> The floom was best
<Bjornfot> smooze is best pony.
<Sol> Smooze pony is best pony
<Apokalipse> smooze is worthless without floom
<Purple`Prose> It is, however, a movie that's better mocked than enjoyed straight.

<Sol> Man, weed is some good stuff
<Apokalipse> mfw this video

<Nittany_Tiger> There's this other really gory cannibal movie that just came to my mind.
<Dumori> am I the only one just not findin this trippy
<Dumori> but just awesome
<Beef> lol
<Diftraku> This vid is Trippy AND Awesome
<Tovler> this music kicks ass
<Dumori> is mike my brain on a avrage day
<FreezeFrame> My dorm neighbors just put a ton of wasabi in the one guy's sushi.
<GGgala> for the record, this commercial's called Superflat Monogram - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Pg9wmaGlg
<ThePretender> wow
<Diftraku> wat
<FreezeFrame> My neighbors are RD, apparently.
<Nittany_Tiger> my brain on an avg day: Segmentation Fault.
<Diftraku> a commercial...
<ThePretender> muting the stream, and having Wu-Tang play in the bg is quite...interesting
<GGgala> Descrption: "An old louis vuitton commercial made by Takashi Murakami, directed by Mamoru Hosada..
<GGgala> "
<FreezeFrame> Ah, fragrance commercial
<SuperBrony64> I'd be pissed if I was that girl right now
<ThePretender> nooo, not programming!
<FreezeFrame> That explains the randomness
<Edward_Newgate> muting playing Katamari Damacy music in bg. Same as before
<Tovler> Old as hell, look at that phone
<Wrek> 05this reminds me of digimon the movie, yay childhood nostalgia. must be a few of the same animators
<Nittany_Tiger> I do a butt-load of programming every week.
<GGgala> Wrek: same here man
<Fluttershy`> prince-dari: Uh oh... Luna just got onto Skype too. Whole lotta catchin' up for her to do too!
<ThePretender> I thought the same thing, Wrek
<Diftraku> Wrek, it does look a lot like
<Sol> All that for a cell phone
<Dumori> Nittany_Tiger: Programming is magic fun time
<ThePretender> also, this movie needs to be played sometime here
<SuperBrony64> Girl: "MOM! I wanna buy a Louis Vuitton now! To hell with college!"
<Dumori> I do it for fun
<Tovler> It's me after I watching a new pony. How depressing
<Nittany_Tiger> It is fun.
<Dumori> this is only better with lag...
<Dumori> :\
<ThePretender> Java is fun, C++ isn't
<Apokalipse> AWWW YEAH
<Sol> YES
<SuperBrony64> Oh boy
<Revolver> FUCK YAE!
<Apokalipse> Sol you are a genious
<SuperBrony64> Time for MC Public Urination and MC Chorus Guy
<Dumori> Java, C* so alike man
<Nittany_Tiger> I've learned a lot of Matlab in the past two weeks.
*Fluttershy` BRBs because she really needs to and has been delaying her BRB for the longest time so... BRB
<Wrek> 05aaaw yeah
<mooponi> c++ is fun the same way that df is "fun"
<Diftraku> PHP: Why am I doing this again?
<Wrek> 05wtf collective is win
<mooponi> losing is fun!
<Ziltoid> Matlab...?
<Dumori> I was rasied on .lua
<GGgala> mooponi, 'df'?
<Nittany_Tiger> I've touch Perl, C, and Matlab so far.
<mooponi> dwarf fortress
<GGgala> ahh
<Revolver> I was raised on 3Ds Max
<Nittany_Tiger> Learned C in a class. Taught myself Perl and Matlab.
<Nittany_Tiger> With help.
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIFdywkXhwA
<mooponi> you spent ages building what you think is a thriving and unbreakable stronghold
<mooponi> then it all goes to shit
*GGgala prefers Python
<Dumori> I learn lua by ripping apart scripts in homeworld 2
<Tovler> Kids are being raised on a 3DS
<Nittany_Tiger> Perl is easy, but Matlab code is a bitch.
<mooponi> sounds like C++ to me
<Dumori> when I was like 10
<ThePretender> even though they're similar, I click more with Java. C++ makes me flip tables in rage.
<Wrek> 05i prever cinema over 3ds max
<Wrek> 05prefer*
<Diftraku> Applejack's United States of Apples
<Dumori> tbh my C like coding funky
<Revolver> I just like 3ds Max cause it's what they use at my school
<Nittany_Tiger> WTF. Hub commercial on the Discovery Channel?
<Dumori> I walay have the most inane buggs
<mooponi> its owned by discovery isnt it?
<Dumori> self taught coding
<Wrek> 053d brohoof Revolver
<Dumori> Discover kids and Hasbro I think
<Nittany_Tiger> I just saw a commercial for a Hub show on The Discovery channel. :/
<Tovler> Discovery markets HUB and Hasbro does the programming
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh.
<Edward_Newgate> poor chorus song
<Edward_Newgate> chorus guy
<Revolver> Naked Gun!
<SuperBrony64> inb4 MC Lethal Weapon 1 2 3
<FreezeFrame> Poor chorus chicken
<Nittany_Tiger> I was thinking of ownership, but I thought Discovery gave Disc. Kids up completely.
<Tovler> I don't remember seeing Naked Gun 2 1/2
<Revolver> I saw it
<FreezeFrame> I prefer 33 1/3
<Dumori> not 100% Nittany_Tiger
<Wrek> 05MC chorus guy makes this video worthwhile
<Tovler> Seen 33 1/3 to death
<Revolver> Same here
<ThePretender> same
<SuperBrony64> inb4 MC Amnesia realizing Rape
<Sol> I prefer 2 1/2
