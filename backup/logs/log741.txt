<Spike_is_7thElement> DROP THE (B)ASS
<TROctavia> No.. commercials.. ?
<Theakman> YAY NO GAK OR FLOAM
<Tuseday> WUBWUBWUBWUB
<Rainbow--Dash> NO NO NO
<flutterchu> um.....exuse me i have a quistion
<Gilda> Dediucated to the memory of Mel Blanc.
<Vordox> Thank you Hanna Barbera. <3 For everything.
<EonMaster> well, that was a bit music shift
<Yahooz> flutterchu: shoot
<Rainbow--Dash> Spike_is_7thElement NO
*Dark92Enigma The animation is superb, the soundtrack is awesome, but the story is very weak. It's just recycled plot lines from the TV series, and a half-assed, phoned-in moral. This was probably the final word on The Jetsons and they STILL didn't give Judy much development. Jetsons: The Movie could have been better. It's not GOOD, but it's not terrible. It's a proper send-off for the Jetsons, IMO 5.4/10
<Rainbow--Dash> JUST NO
<Yahooz> i can answer it
<turtlegod98> classic music
<Spike_is_7thElement> heh
<CrystalPhoenix> Noone can stop....The Gaaaaak

<Kandarihu> I wish I could've watched Littlest Pet Shop. Unfortunately, they did a post-show for the episode that I really couldn't care less for.
<Zamer> CrystalPhoenix Best part of that episode
<Kencolt> CrystalPhoenix: Okay, okay,. I'll help you find the kitchen, But I still need that sammitch.
<thelonepony> GAK WONT BE POPULER
<Ifiredmylazar> what happened to twilight barkle
<twilight_sprinkle> DeathStgak: NOOOOOOOOO D:
<d3rb_> whhy isnt shinning armors cuttie mark a javalin
<thelonepony> God damn it
<CrystalPhoenix> Kencolt, that quote....my sides are gone now
<Miss_Rarity> gak will die by next week.
<CrystalPhoenix> thanks
<cookemon> gak will be like first
<Miss_Rarity> in fact, it got irratating about 3 hours in.
<Gakpony> gak will die by tomorrow
<twilight_sprinkle> gak is like gangnam, but still better
<Zamer> Gak is one of those 80's/90's fads
<d3rb_> lol doubt it, people still use 20% cooler ffs
<flutterbrony1234> what now?
<Invi> oh hai twilight_sprinkle
<Kandarihu> d3rb_, his special talent is making forcefields, not weapons
<flutterchu> Gak isnt even a fun word to say....i can't even say it....this is fun to say, OBJECTION *backround music*
<twilight_sprinkle> hey Invi :)
<Deacon> was gak's sudden populariy because of how much it was played?
*thelonepony noms on MLP_Brovakiin :3
<Gilda> Oh is the feed over?
<DarknessPony> anyone got ideas for a pony playtrough?
<Invi> flutterchu, it's like blargh
<Miss_Rarity> but 20% cooler was actually in an episode, gak was a kind of "you had to be there" kind of thing.
<twilight_sprinkle> the gak makers will love hub now
<AJIsAwesome> Deacon: Pretty much.
<DarknessPony> i dont know if i shoud do welcome to ponyvile act 1
<CrystalPhoenix> Deacon, yeah basically
<d3rb_> pretty sure he is meant to be an ace javalin thrower or a SAM site
*MLP_Brovakiin noms thelonepony back :3
<twilight_sprinkle> in fact hub will probably get a lot of money for ths
<Deacon> Gilda more like someone's afk
<aniderp1> the cutie game
<aniderp1> where you applebloom
*LunasGuard throws shark in chat
<cookemon> i don't even like gak but that doesn't mean i'm goin to stop saying it
<aniderp1> story of the blanks
<Deacon> what do you do in the cutie game?
<Gakpony> story of the blank flanks
*d3rb_ hugs shark
<twilight_sprinkle> as stupid as the meme is, if it persists, this will be good for the hub. more companies will want to advertise things on their channel.
<RawketLawnchair> Mystery of the druids
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> oh god
*thelonepony fights the shark with bare hoofs >:I
<Mihoshika> Yes, gak has no favor.
<Miss_Rarity> qwop pony had the best ending.
<flutterchu> yeah...i can't really talk in real life because my tounge is sore from eating drinking or sucking everything a look at......but i can atleast type :)
<Gakpony> So who else played Luna game with headset?
<Mihoshika> flavor*
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, Gangnam Style isn't a forced meme, though. It's really pretty darn catchy
<flutterbrony1234> somepony stream ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> and then hub will become a sellout..
<Invi> Mihoshika, what if you cook it?
<flutterchu> Gakpony: what's Luna game
<thelonepony> flutterbrony1234: never ask for ponies, trust me :S
<flutterchu> ?
<DeathStgak> twilight_sprinkle: witch will make it less likely for adds to repeat an emence number of times
<Deacon> add salt to Gak, it will have tons of flaver then
<Mihoshika> It doesn't gain taste, it just melts, then eventually starts to boil.
<Zamer> I can't wait until April 30, 2042 when the mongrels of that era gets to see the original gak inside the time capsule at Nickolodeon
<flutterbrony1234> g 3?
<Gakpony> you dont want to know what luna game is
<Invi> flutterbrony1234, a creepypasta game as far as i know
<thelonepony> flutterbrony1234: worst
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: idk, it doesnt really feel that forced, not today at least, in the future maybe
<Invi> flutterchu,
<Invi> ^
<Nyra> Sorry guys gotta go eat some oats. Hopefully be back for S3. Choa.
<Mihoshika> Also, the gas is poisonous.
<Miss_Rarity> I loved the rarity and twilight hoof touch at the end of part 2. It was very sweet.
<LunasGuard> Gakpony: wat luna game?
<cookemon> it is non-toxic doe
<Miss_Rarity> ;):)
<Zamer> Sooo many songs in the 1hour premier
<Gakpony> 3
<Deacon> mmm, cookie dough *drools*
<twilight_sprinkle> also nonsense, always ask for ponies!
<flutterchu> Invi: how is it scary when it involves Luna
<flutterbrony1234> oh that i played that before chizzed everywhere
<pony_4908> I think we're starting to see more and more slight shipping-ish feelings amongst the Mane 6.
<thelonepony> oh u sprunkls :3
<Gakpony> For people who dont know what luna game is just google: Luna game end is neigh
<Buytoast> oh look, you can actually read the chat
<Gakpony> And somewhat prepare?
<Buytoast> what a shocker
<Deacon> anyone know the name of that twilight looking dog?
<Zamer> I blame Twilight Sparkle playing around with the feelings of her reverse-harem
<Rainbow--Dash> Twilight Barkle!
<Ifiredmylazar> twighlit barkle
<AJIsAwesome> I think it's more bonding between each other rather than shipping-ish feelings.
<Spike_is_7thElement> soo uhhh whats going on
<Buytoast> so how was that crystal cove episode?
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: It was ok.
<Deacon> well...I mean like real name in the show
<Ifiredmylazar> wierd
<Buytoast> was there another mary sue couple shooting love beams everywhere?
<thelonepony> Buytoast: it was meh
<DeathStgak> oh god XD has everybody seen this? http://ask-gak-pony.tumblr.com/
<CrystalPhoenix> Buytoast, this happened http://i.imgur.com/38VvT.gif
<Invi> flutterchu, after playing it fills your desktio with creepy pinkie pics and also is the game after a few gameplay minutes getting creepy
<AJIsAwesome> Villain wasn't that great.
<thelonepony> Buytoast: somewhat
<JT> buytoast, this time we had a tactical nu* I mean cadence...
<Dashie_Dashie> This is the best stream ever.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, the only reason it got any attention is because 4 short ads for it and related products were aired in a row. I admit that that is probably a perfectly innocent mistake. But we have to be careful not to give it too much attention or else the advertisers will try to replicate whatever success the Gak incident had.
<Gakpony> that tiny.tv was the best stream
<DeathStgak> Dashie_Dashie: not as good as the buffershow
<thelonepony> wish the DHX work on the villian more
<flutterchu> Buytoast: silly kitty....i can read everything everybrony chat;s here on bronystate, i may be stupid as F**k, but i can read like a..................uh...............hmmm..........
<thelonepony> taht*
<thelonepony> that* :P
<Gakpony> whenver a floam commercial came on the chat was flooded with floam inferior gak superior
<Deacon> King Sombra was the3 equivalen of an RPG final boss: you know it's there, but it doesn't do anything unless you confront it
<AJIsAwesome> tehlonpon, you silleh. :3
<pcplayer26> GAK :D
<flutterchu> LIKE A CENTIPEDE!!!!!!!yes
<Buytoast> i'm guessing you weren't here this morning, were you flutterchu?
<Kencolt> I just realised. Shining Armor and Princess C doing a clssic Fastball Special!
<pony_4908> I think Sombra did well to embody the tacit evil of the situation. Like Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty. He didn't really need all that much character development.
<Kandarihu> Deacon, pony_4908, please don't spoil the people who couldn't be here this morning.
<Gakpony> What did sombrero even want? to eat crystals
<thelonepony> ayejay no u ar sillieh :3
<AJIsAwesome> :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well while every particular advertiser will want it, different companies will see the potential and want their stuff to be aired, and so there will be more variety to the ads. they will try to make the ads catchy and memorable and have that shown
<pcplayer26> all sombra was saying was., MMMM crystal...
<Miss_Rarity> sombre looked like an OTT fancharacter. Not in a bad way.
<flutterchu> Buytoast: nope....i fell alseep....it was really 6:00 when they aired the episode's not 10:00...they lied........so i just sat there.....wathed season 3......alone.......:'(
<Ifiredmylazar> what the fuck do we do
<Alicorn_Gundam> So, when are they replaying the season premiere?
<Invi> he has no caharacter to develop though pony_whatevernumber
<AJIsAwesome> Ifiredmylazar: Wait?
<Kencolt> Really, the episode wasn't so much about Sombra as it was about Twilight, when you think about it. This season may show less charactr development and more power development.
<thelonepony> flutterchu: theres next episode :)
<pcplayer26> and at one point, slaves. that's it
<pony_415680> does this room have logs?
<Mihoshika> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wl3lKJT3is&feature=youtu.be
<pony_415680> i want to see the reactions from the episode this morning
<Gakpony> I had many feels for spike at the door part.
<flutterchu> thelonepony: i dont think i can wath it, is thanksgiving next week
<pony_4908> That was horrible. :'(
<flutterchu> ?
<Zamer> I saw Chrysalis more as a Maleficent, Sombra was more like umm
<Invi> Kencolt, spike and twily had charachter development. them episodes felt liek a prequel to something bigger...
<Rainboom> Gakpony: Who wouldn't
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> i never liked Lauren's writers
<Alicorn_Gundam> So, when are they replaying the season premiere?
<Mihoshika> One moment for reactions...
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> they never go over their writings
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, >Chrysalis
<pony_4908> As soon as the host gets back to his computer?
<thelonepony> flutterchu: thanksgiving is a week after nex week :P
<Deacon> pony_415680 if you're using the site's irc client, no, but if using a separate client like mirc, then yes
<Mihoshika> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOD39tCoA0
<CrystalPhoenix> Zamer, >Not Nightmare Moon as Maleficient
<pcplayer26> was anyone here when the chat was flooded with the: TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHAFUCKA?
<thelonepony> next*
<DarknessPony> anyone got a good pony game?
<Pale_Horse> Sobra really had a very poorly developed motivation in my eyes. It was like, his whole point in being a sterotypical mustache-twirling cartoon villain was simply so that the episode could have a villain to drive the plot. :P
<CriticKitten> CrystalPhoenix: Throw your wife! (LIKE A BAWS)
<DerpyClub2> soo, who is your favorite gak?
<flutterchu> thelonepony: then i cant watcvh episode 4........personal reasons
<Rainboom> The door part was probably the most emotional part in the episode and it actually made me cry when Twilight was crying near the window
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, and as long as they succeed at making catchy and memorable ads, the memes they create will be natural. That's advertising done right. The Gak ads that we saw this morning were only notable for their repetition. And they became a meme, at least for today. If that becomes something to exploit, that would be advertising done wrong
<Gakpony> DarknessPony: get the gameloft pony game for ios and android
<pony_415680> Mihoshika: horrible quality, i was looking for another video
<Kandarihu> I'm hearing prince-dari's mice
<Mihoshika> Oh :P
<P0N-3> Omigosh Trixie is coming back.
<Kandarihu> mic
<P0N-3> And omigosh Scootaloo episode.
<Dark_Horst> i hear... somehting
<Ryunosuke> some ponies just want to watch the world burn :)
<CrystalPhoenix> Chrysalis is Ursula, Nightmare Moon is Maleficient, Sombra is.....something
<pcplayer26> darknesspony: you got faithful farmer on devianart
<RDash5000> wooo
<pony_415680> nobody here records logs?
<Dashie_Dashie> Dari..
<CriticKitten> I don't get the Gak thing. Yes it was advertised a lot, but it wasn't THAT funny. ._.
<Gakpony> oh sht hes awake?
<Rainboom> Im gonna cry in Sleepless in Ponyville it makes me wanna hug Scootaloo :'(
<thelonepony> Dabi
<flutterchu> if only i could stream.......
<cookemon> gakobowl
<pony_2073> what is going on
<DerpyClub2> who is favorite Gak?
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: It kind of floored te international community.
<pony_2073> what is that noice
<pony_2073> who is talking?
<DarknessPony> thanks i might even record all of the pony games iv played
<flutterchu> Rainboom: whuh........why?
<Dark_Horst> he be talking to someone
<desertman2> Those were pings
<Gakpony> is he back?
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: They're easily amused then. There are so many much worse commercials.
<pony_2073> i heard voices
<Mihoshika> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/33610
<Ifiredmylazar> oh gawd i can only imagine the number of tf2 gak sprays
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah, it will be exploitable as long as there arent many ads to be shown. but if more companies catch on to this, they might offer hub their own ads, which will cause more variety. the worse possibility is other companies dont notice it but the ones that already have a contract with hub will, and theyll spam it like today
<Rainboom> flutterchu: Not allowed to say spoilers but ik what the episode is about you can look it up on Wikipedia
<Gakpony> Fallout Equestria: The novel 50000 pages
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: Yes. but not four times in a row. Someone at the HUB is getting yelled at a LOT>
<Zamer> I would say she was Ursala in the beginning, but once the wedding actually started she became Malecifient
<Wanderer> i wanna see a movie
<DerpyClub2> who was on here last night?
<DerpyClub2> HAMMERHEAD YAK ATTACK
<thelonepony> DABI :O
<Zamer> ya know with the green glowing eyes, green magic fire all around her
<twilight_sprinkle> dabi eez ded
<P0N-3> I hope we get to see Trixie outside of her Trixie persona for once!
<AJIsAwesome> Umm, prince-dari? You're on stream.
<Rainboom> I stayed for Movie Night watching How To Train Your Dragon
<Deacon> Wanderer sorry, movies are kind over, they'll be back next week though
<thelonepony> sprunkls ;^;
<Gakpony> Giving applejack the job to lie to other ponies >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> matt smith ate him :>
<thelonepony> :D
<Rainbow--Dash> ikr XD
<pony_2073> the mic is on
<DarknessPony> i watched How to Train Your dragon but slept trough Jetstones half of it
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: But that's just it, it's not that bad by comparison to normal commercials. Just got repeated a lot.
<Ifiredmylazar> :D:P
<Kencolt> Gakpony: AJ didn't lie even once, SHe just avoided a few facts.
<pony_4908> Look, there's a moose! >_>
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, there are already a lot of companies offering their ads to The Hub. It's not like it's a fledgling network being built from scratch. Even from the beginning, The Hub was merely the channel formerly known as Discovery Kids.
<flutterchu> OH BOY A............oh wait....i forgot
<pony_2073> i heard 2 different voices
<cookemon> that took a long time
<DerpyClub2> A GIANT HAMMERHEAD YAK
<Zippoman924> So what is happening now?
<Zamer> plus the Hub is mainly a Giant Toyad block
<LunasGuard> AGGGH the pings
<Ifiredmylazar> a giant hammerhead gak?
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: Which nopony watched... Oh, I see.
<Rainboom> Flutterknight needs to be canon (you know besides FlutterTree FlutterRage and Flutterbitch)
<Unholycondolences> thats a Traffic Cone!
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i guess, although i havent notced much variety in their ads in any case
<Rainboom> oh and Flutterguy
<Wanderer> There is da punch?
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: Sonny's stream is on
<Deacon> I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter C
<Zamer> and speaking of Hub 3 Gak commericials just went back~2~back
<DRHUnleashed> TRAFFIC COOOOOOOOOOOOONE
<DerpyClub2> A GIANT HAMMERHEAD YAK RIDING A HAMMERHEAD WHALE
<Rainboom> Deacon: Chatbox?
<flutterchu> Flutterclop.........(fanfics)..........had to read them all.....i had no choice :'(
<CrystalPhoenix> I still have to say
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, there are ads targetted at boys, girls, and parents.
<Invi> Rainboom, didn't Fluttershy dressed as a knight in the christmas episode?
<P0N-3> Floam and Gak are like the Black Mesa and Aperture Science of toy sludge.
<CrystalPhoenix> an empire controled by emotion is quite original
<Gakpony> Implying the portal gun doesnt use Gak
<Rainboom> Invi: Yeah but she was a knight with RD in S3
<Ifiredmylazar> come on we need streaming
<Deacon> Rainboom actually card games
<Rainbow--Dash> AGREED PON-3
<Rainboom> Card games?
<Kencolt> The idea was probably to make sure one got out whileleaving room for local cable providers to add local ads.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i didnt mean age variety, i meant overall variety, as in just amount of different ads
<Invi> Rainboom, ja then, there ya go ^^
<DerpyClub2> lets play eye-spy
<Rainboom> Yay
<flutterchu> if only there was an OLYMPICS episode in MLP....THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!
<Gakk> http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/433470-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic#comments
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<DerpyClub2> I spy with my little eye something black
<Deacon> Rainboom if you watched the new episode of YGOTAS, it'll make sense
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Zamer> Oh funny note, for the Dan Vs. S3 commercial where he has to press a button for everything he hates
<J_E_Smith71> You know, the Gak thing wasn't even new today. Skip to the 10:37 mark: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiz95K1ngiI&feature=g-high-u
<Gakpony> flutterchu: there was that one iron pony episode
<Rainboom> I spy with my little eye something orange with white on it
<Invi> CrystalPhoenix, digimon has a whole parallel universe controlled by emotion ^^
<Zamer> Pinkie Pie is the only exception
<Zippoman924> :[You are going to Love Me!:[
<CrystalPhoenix> Invi, SHUSH YOU
<P0N-3> Floam and Gak probably have shady origins.
<flutterchu> Gakpony: whuh?
<DerpyClub2> Rainboom, is it a traffic cone on your computer?
<Invi> CrystalPhoenix :D
<Kencolt> TRAFFIC CONE! Am I right?
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, the only ad that actually generated memes for it's own content is a network spot for Pound Puppies. That's where we got the Secret Butt Fun ad.
<DarknessPony> well i might record this live stream
<flutterchu> Gakpony: i dont remember one episode called iron man who what not.....
<Rainboom> DerpyClub2: Ding ding ding!
<Rainbow--Dash> WHAT ABOUT GAK!?
<DerpyClub2> yayz
<pony_4908> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PQe07mXSKA&feature=g-all-c
<Gakpony> flutterchu: you know the episode where RD and AJ were just doing competitions and what not
<Rainboom> :3
<Ifiredmylazar> and punch holes in the sky
<Rainboom> PUNCH HOLES IN THIS GUY!
<Ifiredmylazar> and hate on gamefly
<Casey1859> So whatthe heck is this stream?
<P0N-3> Gak is just a biproduct from the rainbow factory... ;)
<DerpyClub2> I spy something that rhymes with cronyplate
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yes, although i would hope other ads dont become memes due to unintentional sexual jokes
<Zippoman924> Is there a problem or did the stream stop I just came back here.
<MASF123> It's a mircale...yes I know I know I'm not dead. :|
<Rainbow--Dash> Stream stopped
<Zippoman924> ok
<Rainboom> I spy with my little eye something that is secret but its fun (guess where that came from ik your gonna guess it in ten seconds flat though)
<MASF123> miracle
<DarknessPony> he is eating sleeping wait if it says on Air
<DarknessPony> He probly doing something?
<DarknessPony> but what?
<DerpyClub2> Rainboom: Pound Puppies?
<Ifiredmylazar> i thought this was going on for 24 hour
<Ifiredmylazar> s
<Gakpony> 5 more minutes.
<AJIsAwesome> I hope he knows he's live.
<terrafox> I've just watched the new ep, it was AMAZING!!
<DerpyClub2> who here saw the season premier of littlest pet shop?
<Rainboom> DerpyClub2: You are on fire! Oh wait I forgot *gets matches and lighter*
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, indeed. I remember the Madoka Magica fandom launched a meme for Morning Rescue, just for being hillariously out of place for the show it was sponsoring.
<Zamer> He probably got stuck in the toilet again
<Zamer> and I did DerpyClub2
<flutterchu> now i know how painful it is to smoke.....
<P0N-3> Gak is the sludge they scrape out of the bottoms of the spectra vats.
<Ifiredmylazar> he probably is still asleep from the jetsons movie
*flutterchu noms on cigarette
*Rainboom throws match on DerpyClub2 NOW you on fire! :D
<DerpyClub2> it wasnt all that bad zamer
*flutterchu burns his/her mouth
<DerpyClub2> tand also
<flutterchu> :'(
<DerpyClub2> tAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
<Gilda> >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: ah well ive never heard about that fandom or that ad, but yeah
<Rainboom> *trollface*
<CrystalPhoenix> OH YEAH
<Cypresswolf> Hello Everypony :) Back down to a managable number I see

<Zamer> Hey you better be careful or you will get sued by the Dale Corporation Rarity
<P0N-3> Lol I should buy a bunch of Gak, then send Bad Dragon a customer service complaint that my item is melting... then send them a bunch of Gak in a box.

<Deacon> hmm, what was everyone's opinion on the fanmade episode Dusk Dawn?
<MASF123> Where are the mods.
<OJ> I'm a LumberGak and I'm okay. I sleep all night and I work all day.
<Miss_Rarity> it wouldnt be "my little human" sounds kinda scientific. would probably be something like "my little ladies" or something wierd like that. ;)

<Dashie_Dashie> I want to watch season 3 but I don't, I want to watch it on here >_>
<Miss_Rarity> IM NOT WEARING UNDERWEAR
<DocSane> I was disappointed by the complete non-development of King Sombra and intrigued by some of the new plot threads they set up.
<SpirittHoove> Ok what do ya'll think that book Luna had was all about?
<MASF123> Dashie_Dashie: Too late.
<CrystalPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, AW YEAH
<LunasGuard> did anyone see the easter egg in S3
<Deacon> ~I wanna be a pop star / Because then you'll let me get more engrossed in you / A shining pop star /Spreading my wings, I'll cast a spell only on you!~
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> DocSane: exactly what plot threads?
<Gakpony> Lunas book was starswirl the bearded
<Ifiredmylazar> king sombra was just there to be evil. period.
<flutterbrony1234> when can we do that
<Nyra> Starswirl will make an appearence in S3, just sayin.
<IshBaneVoicePony> does anypony know what won the lottery today?
<SpirittHoove> but is she takeing over as Twilights teacher ?
<Gakpony> Princess Platinum.
<Zamer> Sombra was used for the essence of fear
<Miss_Rarity> bitches love starswirl.
<Deacon> IshBaneVoicePony no idea
<DocSane> Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: Well, what is "the next step" for Twilight? Why was Luna so nervous about exposing her to the magic in the Crystal Empire? What was in Luna's black book that she magicked up at the end.
<MASF123> Whelp I'll be going now. I only came to say "Hi" and add friends onto that MLP Mobile game which didn't work out so well.
<LunasGuard> star wars refer was not in S3 >_>
<Miss_Rarity> and Princess platinum was beautiful. ;)

<sub06905> prince-dari, :3
<Rainboom> GAK GAK GAK
<Invi> Nyra, what if all villians will reappear at once together :O
<Deacon> SpirittHoove would be kinda right now after the movies ended, but it seems like our streamer is afk
<Princess_Celestia> or asleep
<Miss_Rarity> THEY ARE TESTING OUR PATIENCE
<thelonepony> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7eqsb5IAp1qb6i6bo1_1280.jpg

<weegee2062> curved lol wut
<Kandarihu> Invi, it's rare to see a good story where all antagonists come together and appear together. It makes sense if they have common fates like all going to the same prison.
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai Nittany_Discord
<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: sorry
<SpirittHoove> dear celestia i hope they re play the commercials just for the gak

<P0N-3> Dude don't worry about HotDiggityDemon. It's just Max being Max.
<Gakpony> i enjoy hotdiggitydemons animations
<Zamer> I'm sad there were no Tonton sleeping bags
<DocSane> I also wasn't expecting his solution to impending to doom to be "THrow my wife at it."

<Miss_Rarity> the pings keep happening in a pattern
<sub06905> dem echo pings :P prince-dari
<P0N-3> The main thing that bothered me about the Andrew WK panel is that Andrew seemed like he was really coked up.
<Zamer> the closer the pings, the closer you are to death
<Gakpony> Andrew w k wrote a song called get ready to die
<fluttershyftw16> ready to die
<Gakpony> "coked up"
<fluttershyftw16> cupcakes
<Miss_Rarity> slenderpings?
<Kandarihu> This would require an alliance of Nightmare Moon, Discord, Queen Chrysalis, the Flim Flam Brothers, Trixie, Gilda, and Diamond Tiara. And I'm probably missing somepony.
<P0N-3> Who, me?
<Ifiredmylazar> no cupcakes

<dinomaster626> we jump out the windo like gak gak gak
<kidzrul732> you know what gak really is? HORSE SEMEN
<Stephano> My little Gak: Gak is magic
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: :<
<Nyra> Ok. Thats settles it. S4 Villain will be GAK, Stretcher of Worlds.
<XylemTube> :'(
<MadSurge> ...*grunt*
<dinomaster626> gak the name of the frist cell
<stallion1> kidzrul732: so have some coffee its awesome and will make you feel better more than likely
<Cypresswolf> Whats this Gak pony stuff? Go to a meetup for approx 11 hours and I missed quite a bit
<Spyrofan001> im planiing to talking to Activison about my spyro game idea
<XylemTube> Gak is the best thing ever
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: You don't want to know.
<Afflict> ah ok
<dinomaster626> ill exlin gak if your couriuos
<thelonepony> ^^
<Afflict> Well it couldn't hurt
<Spyrofan001> its about spyro and his mate (u chose from Cynder or Ember)
<pony_2073> gak is a toy
<Cypresswolf> XylemTube: so were Moonshoes, but I digress :)
<Nyra> All he would say is GAK IS BACK.
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: there were four commercials of it during the ponies stream
<pony_2073> they ran too many commercialls
<kidzrul732> ok ok I know that you people had gak as kids but can you stop bringing it up?!
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: apparently someone at the hub thought it was a good idea to run a commercial for Gak four times in a row in one break
<Shizuka> 13and floam
<MadSurge> ^
<stallion1> gak is liquid awesome
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Long story short, some Gak commercials kept appearing in a row. SO often that people decided to make a meme out of it.
<Cypresswolf> I remember Gak :) it was fun in the 90's
<Shizuka> 13the episode seems to have sucked enough that gak became more popular
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: that is true.
<J_E_Smith71> Cypresswolf: The Hub ran a bunch of Gak ads today during the new episode one after the other and it triggered a bunch of chat spam and for some reason it broke out into a chat spam meme
<stallion1> lol
<Kencolt> Cypresswolf: When the HUB first showed the new eps this morning, they had a plethora of commercials for Floam and Gak-- two old toys rereleased after more than a decade. In particular, for some reason, four GAK commercials were shown in a row. It sort of took off.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: people are bawwwwing about the villain
<Cyber_Cat> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/433/246/7df.png
<Shizuka> 13from what i've heard, i don't blame them
<dinomaster626> its a pladow/gell like toy on a 1800 infromershal that repeted alot during the stream pepole spamed it so much it became a new meam
<GakISBESTPONY> Hey everpony
<Cypresswolf> I saw the gak commercial air twice - most of the commercials were covered with Houston Brony videos
<Afflict> So are you gonna try to get them to make it, or do you want permission to make a fangame or something?
<String_Shredder> Shizuka: Well, the villain didn't even speak a full sentence from what I remember.
<stallion1> yea
<Shizuka> 13an entire region of the continent and its associated villain appears out of thin air and goes away by the end of the episode?
<Phase4> 00,02floam + gak = ?
<pony_2073> villian was not entertaining enough, so we got attached to GAK instead
<Shizuka> 13mare do well had better writing if that was the case
<d3rb_> flak?
<kidzrul732> Keep this up and this will become GAKSTATE
<dinomaster626> is the gak comercial on youtube
<Spyrofan001> you get to create there kids personality like the sims but u acttile get to play it in 1st person or 3rd person
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I don't think the villain was the point of the episode :I
<pony_2073> floam + gak = Portal to Equestria.
<stallion1> villain no good
<Iwa> Shizuka: The writing for the magic used was very, VERY well done though...
<String_Shredder> Phase4: Goam
<Kencolt> Cypresswolf: We got to see the raw feed. You saw from a local cable, so there was room to add local commercials-- which is usually the intent.
<Cypresswolf> Everypony freaked out at the Baby Alive commercial *shudders*
<Phase4> 00,02pony_2073, :D
<Mayonaiize> so exciting
<Nyra> GAK = G Version of FRAK
<pony_2073> i already solved this equasion
<Rainboom> Gak x Floam <3
<GakISBESTPONY> wtf...
<pony_2073> equation
<GakISBESTPONY> is this guy
<GakISBESTPONY> saying
<Shizuka> 13Iwa: well the cold open turned me off
<thelonepony> kidzrul732: too late, it's actually dolanstate
<Afflict> that would be so amazing
<thelonepony> :P
<stallion1> I thought the episodes were pretty good
<TheMonstaMuffin> As i said i missed the premiere
<GakISBESTPONY> S3 will be a questionanle one....story wise...
<Spyrofan001> im going to have them make it because i know nothing about creating games because im only 14
<TheMonstaMuffin> :(
<GakISBESTPONY> what will happen?
<kidzrul732> that's it I'm going to bed, and i expect this gak bullshit to be over tomorrow when I wake up

<Shizuka> 13you have the princess and her subjects that have destroyed three huge villains in the span of two years, there shouldn't be anything that panics them that much anymore
<stallion1> !!
<Nyra> NEVER
<Iwa> Shizuka: Well...like they say, can't please everyone :)
<GakISBESTPONY> Will it end up like...
<NullRadix> kidzrul732: your optimism is tasty
<Kencolt> You mean when you wake up covered in Gak.
<GakISBESTPONY> bad or good?
<Spyrofan001> or im going to have my friend get promission to make it and he can make it for me
<GakISBESTPONY> Also
<stallion1> lol
<Shizuka> 13but it opens with "IT has returned", i paused the video and thought "really? they're seriously going with that open?"
<J_E_Smith71> Cypresswolf Shizuka: This wasn't the first time the Hub showed so many Gak ads. It actually happened the first time four weeks ago during a rerun of Winter Wrap Up. However it didn't trigger spam since the chat only had a few people.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: well they just sent Twilight to deal with it :D
<Shizuka> 13and then i did other things and haven't finished the eps
<pony_2073> I project the gak phenonenom will continue untill sometime late next week
<stallion1> GGAAKK
<dinomaster626> theres won vilon that cant defeat
<GakISBESTPONY> The villian from s3 was the first one to actually be kileld
<pony_2073> when the real first episode of season 3 will be shown
<GakISBESTPONY> evaporated to nothing
<J_E_Smith71> We basically did react to the fact they played so many but then dropped it when the episode started again
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, yeah, show's still clever but it was a bit contrived
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: as a rule, we cant talk about the new episode til at least tomorrow right?
<Afflict> You might be able to get some people to help you out if you make a couple of posts here and there
<MadSurge> Shizuka: finish it later so you can give examples about how it sucked :D
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: see i haven't seen it so :3
<SpirittHoove> GAK will never end.... we already have a GAK ask pony site!!!!!!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13i can't spoil what i haven't seen
<OJ> The episode gave me my fix. That is all.
<Kencolt> GakISBESTPONY: And I'm not so sure about that. At the last moment we see the fragmented tip of Sombra's horn spin off-- colored bright crimson. He may be back.
<Stephano> It's Gakception
<flutterchu> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rq9v6/
<thelonepony> http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
<GakISBESTPONY> maybe..
<Cypresswolf> My lips are sealed :)
<J_E_Smith71> GakISBESTPONY: His horn remained, and he can control magic with his detached horn so he might have survived
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: I know, right?
<GakISBESTPONY> But it seemed alot like that blast woulda kileld him
<Spyrofan001> im going to try
<GakISBESTPONY> but whatever
<Mayonaiize> try reddit, subreddit /r/gaming and i'll see if I can find some better subs
<Shizuka> 13k enough ep discussion, science time
<GakISBESTPONY> it's a kids show, I'm sure he isn't dead..
<GakISBESTPONY> lol
<DRHUnleashed> he was defeated
<stallion1> that must take forever
<pony_2073> SEASON 3 Premeir on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpCcAXyWTH8
<Spyrofan001> ok i will do
<dinomaster626> mabey next episode we shuld all have usenames with gak puns

<flutterchu> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rq9w3/
<GakISBESTPONY> WHY
<Spyrofan001> sub?
<GakISBESTPONY> WHHHHYYYYYY
<GakISBESTPONY> POOR NATIVE DUDDEE
<Kencolt> Nyra: Chrysalis was attempting a subtle, manuipluative takeover. She can't pull that off again-- they are ready for her. Sombra was going for sheer force.
<Spyrofan001> are we talking about food?
<Shizuka> 13oi
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: We get it. Please don't spam that picture.
<Shizuka> 13enough ep discussion
<Shizuka> 13science time
<Cypresswolf> :) At the end of the meetup, we had a cosplay skit - had a Celestia & an Applejack - Applejack sent Celestia the letter "I didn't learn anything" - Celestia teleports to AJ to discuss her letter - and "To the Moon" with AJ

<Shizuka> 13hundred billion galaxies
<Mayonaiize> i'll put unofficial
<Shizuka> 13each with hundred billion stars
<Muffins_R_Tasty> MAGIC IS SCIENCE (that we havent explained yet)
<Shizuka> 13and you all think we're alone in the universe?
<stallion1> so mank aliens
<MadSurge> Shizuka: IKR
<Cypresswolf> That's one journey I'd love to partake in
<wolf> ITS SO PREDICTABLE
<DRHUnleashed> My Little Universe: Galaxies are Magic
<Afflict> k
<MadSurge> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<dinomaster626> yes it has science looks like magi to a primative cluture
<SpirittHoove> heck no im going to creat a starcraft and find equestria out there!
<GakISBESTPONY> MAYBE THOSE GUYS ON KOLOB KNOW
<Hamadryad> statistically there is other life out there
<GakISBESTPONY> THOSE KOLBIANS KNOW ALL
<GakISBESTPONY> DERRP
<Nyst> Shikuza: we'd still need life close enough and within the same timeframe of our own species' existance if we want to meet them :)
<Nyra> K Guys lets set off and find the planet GAK
<DerpyMuffins> My Little Multiverse: Fandom is magic
<nickrod808> science is gak
<SpirittHoove> Equestria must be found :X
<thelonepony> nickrod808: ..... no
<Iwa> That moment you realise there could be a planet inhabitted by sentient equines
<stallion1> ok ill be back lata
<XylemTube> Starsv are made ofGAK
<Kinixys> There is likely other life out there, maybe even sentient, but making contact across such distances seems incredably unlikely.
<pony_2073> symphonyofscience makes good videos with this kind of stuff
<thelonepony> just... now
<thelonepony> no*
<Eddmario> What the FUCK is with the obsession with Gak in this fandom today?
<AJIsAwesome> Eddmario: I HAVE NO IDEA.

<thelonepony> Eddmario: ikr?
<GakISBESTPONY> During the stream
<Eddmario> So there was a commercial for it during the premiere...
<Nyst> Kinixys: and those that could would probably be beyond our imagining.
<SpirittHoove> You had to be there
<GakISBESTPONY> four commercials in a row
<Kinixys> Eddmario: Nearly all the ads during the premier were for Gak.
<AJIsAwesome> Eddmario: That played four times in a row.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<GakISBESTPONY> FOUR
<DerpyMuffins> I think gak is a meme or something
<dinomaster626> are space craft the ss GAK
<MadSurge> Eddmario: four different commercials. Still, the fad has no reason to be
<OJ> Hell I was there and I don't get it.
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: It already is.
<GakISBESTPONY> Directer gak
<SpirittHoove> GAKGAKGAK x 4

<NT|TF2> 11,01And the Obama killed our space program.
<MadSurge> Ohai NT|TF2 :D
<Kencolt> Eddmario: Not A commercial. Four in a row. Hammered in our face.
<Nyst> I thought it was Bush who cut the funding?
<AJIsAwesome> ^

<SpirittHoove> wolf IM WIT U
<thelonepony> ^^^^*

<Cypresswolf> I didnt have internet til around '95
<GakISBESTPONY> so our gak
<GakISBESTPONY> was our only entertainment except masturbating to barbie dolls
<Kencolt> The original selling point of Gak, back in it's earliest days on Nickelodeon, was that you cuold make it fart. No, seriously.
<GakISBESTPONY> Gak was preventing us from becoming gay
<SpirittHoove> ah now Gak has invaded winter wrap up and its playing in my head :S
<crimson> Why are there so many terrible GAK puns
*thelonepony noms on Domo's + Hat :3

<J_E_Smith71> Poniator on the subject of Gak: On the subject of gak: it's funny only﻿ because the commercials kept repeating during the breaks. It's just another case of gyro bowls, doggie doo or magneto from that one S1 marathon. Their comedic value and relevancy to ponies fades pretty quickly.
<thelonepony> Night Rainbow--Dash :)
<AJIsAwesome> GakISBESTPONY: The link. It's considered a link.

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Pinkie wanting a Fugle Horn was SOOO CUTE /)^3^(\

<CrystalPhoenix> [SWAG]Haku, you're just mad cause you expected some goofy villain like Discord
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> bye MadSurge
<[SWAG]Haku> JUST BEING 10 FEET HIGHER THAN SOMEONE CAN MAKE YOU AGE 0.000000001 TIMES FASTER

<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Rustymeat: i got 502, you got nothing on me
<thelonepony> Hi fluttershyfan99 :)
<WinterSpeed> what was nightmare fuel?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, fluttershyfan99. :)
<TROctavia> Walking makes you age less.
<fluttershyfan99> bad timing?
<TROctavia> according to the theory of relavity i believe
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> [SWAG]Haku: we already did, or do you have a short attention span
<Kinixys> WinterSpeed: Pinkie Pie!
<[SWAG]Haku> NIGHTMARE MOON WASNT GOOFY, BUT I FELT MORE THREATENED BY HER LAME WAYS OF SCARING THE PONIES THAN I DID THE EVIL KING
<LunasGuard> lol
<CrystalPhoenix> [SWAG]Haku, the villain was still alright as a plot device
<AJIsAwesome> WinterSpeed: It's basically the things that give you nightmares or will haunt you.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<XAX> Allegr0: I'll be a special guest :D
<[SWAG]Haku> I DONT EVEN REMEMBER HIS NAME, THATS HOW BAD HE WA
<SaxyPretender> 0,14woah, chill out, [SWAG]Haku

<[SWAG]Haku> SYEAH, MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK AGAIN
<dinomaster626> What The GAk
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> CrystalPhoenix: it was a terrible plot device tho
<WinterSpeed> so what is the pic?
<[SWAG]Haku> I REALLY NEED TO TRY AND FIX IT ONE OF THESE DAYS
<SaxyPretender> 0,14=_=
<CriticKitten> His name was King Sombra. >_>
<dinomaster626> this chat just got GAKED
<AJIsAwesome> He was OK, but he wasn't really a great villain.
<flutterchu> "BRB i need water"<======righ there
<TROctavia> At least his name is spanish for darkness
<Kinixys> WinterSpeed: Pinkie Pie showing us a face trick.
<CrystalPhoenix> Darkts3|Trader|Snipe, if it wasn't for Cadence there would be no chance to save the crystal ponies
<[SWAG]Haku> ok i fixed it for now
<[SWAG]Haku> my point still remains, I didnt remember his name because he didnt leave an impression on me
<Dovah> [SWAG]Haku: if it gets stuck hold shift so you dont have caps
<dinomaster626> he wouled be a better villon if they go back to him in futuer episode
<WinterSpeed> I wan see .o.
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> CrystalPhoenix: lolwut
<[SWAG]Haku> Shut up Dovah
<Crazyty10> Cards against humanity broke me

<Domo> ... ;~;
<Dovah> [SWAG]Haku: I. Will. EAT. You.
<Gakpony> Bronycon 2013 Moves to Baltimore
<CriticKitten> Or maybe because your memory is bad. He wasn't that great of a villain but they uttered his name numerous times.
<fluttershyfan99> TO THE MOON
<AJIsAwesome> NO!!!!! ;3;
<dinomaster626> GAK Atatck
<[SWAG]Haku> Now, if they bring the eveil king back for the season finale, that would redeem him
<Ponies47> O_O
<crazypony> nooooooo
<twilight_sprinkle> D:
<Ponies47> Nuuuuuuuuuuuu
<CriticKitten> So there's no reason you SHOULDN'T know it.
<SpirittHoove> really? :'(
<Kinixys> WinterSpeed: You can see it at EQD. Its in one of the adverts for the new MLP season.
<LunasGuard> :'(
<VenHur> TO THE MOOOOOOONAAAAAAA!
<Kendraco> noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Rosfox> Waaaaaaaaat
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<AdamTheDuck> Last?
<Rustymeat> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Buytoast> well that's a surprise
<thelonepony> :'(
<sub06905> ;__;
<Lil> This was my first time watching :(
<AJIsAwesome> Darn it!!!!! ;~;
<Zamer> COME BACK TO US I SHALL PAY YOU DOUBLE
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Yo Allegr0 its wrong to advertise other streaming sites
<WinterSpeed> okaay
<Datcord> ...Darn.
<flutterchu> Allegr0:...............why?
<WinterSpeed> WHAT
<Derpy101> :'( Me to Lil
<flutterchu> im confused
<SpirittHoove> link to new site?
<[SWAG]Haku> but for now, the flim flam brothers remain better villains than Sombra
<Dovah> Allegr0: Go. DIE!!!! :[
<fluttershyfan99> were will you go to!?
<CriticKitten> The Flim Flam Brothers are NOT villains.
<sonicdude558> dat SplitmediaLabs
<dinomaster626> GAK
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Dovah: nice period, you must have had a great education
<Domo> Y...You won't be staff anymore ;~; ?
<J_E_Smith71> Are GigabotHarmonie and Allegr0 still be around and do random streams?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm gonna miss you guys ;_____;
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<sonicdude558> also I am back :P
<thelonepony> ^^^
<CriticKitten> Why do people continue to misunderstand what that term means?
<WinterSpeed> ;_;
<AdamTheDuck> ^^^^^
<AdamTheDuck> ;~;
<Zamer> WOOHOOO
<GigabotHarmonie> I assure you we'll be around. :)
<[SWAG]Haku> CritticKitten Precisely
<Rosfox> :'(
<Zamer> there's always a crazy consipiracy
<flutterchu> Allegr0: all good things have to come to an end....am I right?
*Domo clings to GigabotHarmonie D:
<SaxyPretender> 0,14NOOOO
*GigabotHarmonie hugs everypony.
*Domo and Allegr0 too!
<RainbowPie> hey everyone :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14DON'T LEAVE MEEEEEEE
<AJIsAwesome> IT'S A CONSPIRACY, I TELL YOU!
*AdamTheDuck hugs GigabotHarmonie back ;~;
<GigabotHarmonie> Haha, it's not the end, just a new beginning!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RainbowPie. :)
<GigabotHarmonie> :)
*RainbowPie licks AdamTheDuck
*thelonepony hugs GigabotHarmonie back ;^;
<CriticKitten> Haku: You're attempting to assert that the guy who enslaved an entire race and cursed it for a thousand years isn't a villain?
<CriticKitten> Good luck.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai RainbowPie ;~;
*LunasGuard hugs Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie
<superretroworld> i guess one thing im glad about missing the premiere is the gak commercial
<TROctavia> Bronycon in baltimore.... why...
<XAX> Don't leave Saxy! He gets to make the posts about your show on the homepage! D:
<thelonepony> ohai RainbowPie ;~;
*Zamer ties GigabotHarmonie and Allegr0 to the webservers
<Gakpony> Bronycon 2013 Moves to Baltimore
<[SWAG]Haku> Im not saying the guy wasnt evil, I get that he totally was
<DerpyMuffins> Get better GigabotHarmonie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, what XAX said!
*WinterSpeed throws love to GigabotHarmonie
<TROctavia> I live in NY and I never got to go to it
<CriticKitten> I get that he's not a well executed villain, don't get me wrong.
<TROctavia> the hell, bronycon
<CriticKitten> But claiming he's flat out not a villain is just stupid.
<RainbowPie> where is bronycon?
<Gakpony> Bronycon 2013 Moves to Baltimore
<[SWAG]Haku> But what they showed of him just wasnt... satisfying. We shaw a flashback of him as a tirant, but what about now?
<TROctavia> Baltimore!
<SpirittHoove> :'(
<J_E_Smith71> Can't Bronystate just play Celestia Radio on the stream when you do the show so we can still hear it Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm gonna miss making those posts ;____;
<Datcord> Baltimare*
<RainbowPie> :'(
<fluttershyfan99> what is the noise!?
<RainbowPie> I wont be able to get there!
<[SWAG]Haku> He was still a villain, but what he did in his state justw asnt very good
<Kandarihu> I had to go afk but I have one question to ask before you go
<superretroworld> SaxyPretender: where are you going?
<CriticKitten> Similarly, comparing him to antagonists like the Flim Flam Brothers, who merely scam people out of their money, is also rather ridiculous.
<TROctavia> I was looking for it to be near Manehattan, but I guess not.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm not going anywhere, but the show is ;____;
<Scoot-Scootaloo> J_E_Smith71: What are we, stream stealers?!
<AJIsAwesome> There's a difference between Antagonist and Villain.
*Ponies47 Hugs SaxyPretender
<Gakpony> Gilda was an antagonist
<Ponies47> I feel terrible now that I missed last weeks episode :(
<J_E_Smith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: Well you played off of Celestia Radio this morning for the preshow discussion
<valoreins> hello everypony... GAK
<AJIsAwesome> Discord was a Villain.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, valoreins. :)
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Look, all im trying to say is that the flimflam brothers came off as more villainious than Sombra did as a cloud
<thelonepony> hi valoreins :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> J_E_Smith71: that's because we we're woriking with them! :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14again, link to the show's Twitter: https://twitter.com/PixelPonyShow
<superretroworld> hello valoreins
<CriticKitten> Haku: Except that they're NOT villains.
<rainbowfan> Hooray for da new season :D!
<CriticKitten> And to even put the two in the same tier is absurd.
<[SWAG]Haku> But they were antanotgist
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Holy Crap CrystalPhoenix is overreactly so hard
<CriticKitten> Because they're clearly not.
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> my day is made
<CrystalPhoenix> wat
<[SWAG]Haku> I misspelled that, but the fact remains
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> *clap**clap**clap*
<valoreins> speaking of the new villain... http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/433/188/77c.jpg
<sub06905> Ponies47, looks like you have a banner to edit
<CriticKitten> (and for what it's worth, the Flim Flam Brothers are rather lame antagonists anyways)
<[SWAG]Haku> they were antagonists, just like sombra
<CrystalPhoenix> valoreins, he's kinda growing on me
<CriticKitten> No, not fact.
<AJIsAwesome> valoreins: I didn't mind him.
<fluttershyfan99> what does that smilie face button do?
<superretroworld> someone please calm me down? i feel like spoiling the next episodes
<valoreins> and someone on 4chan describe his badassery http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/433/179/7f1.png
<CrystalPhoenix> true he wasn't much personality wise but has a threat he's interesting
<Rosfox> Valorein: I like him just really wished he developed more
<Ponies47> sub06905, I made several versions for them. Now I know why ;_;
<rainbowfan> My day was made this morning... anyway Prince Sombras wasn't very good.. I didn't like his design and he only said 5 or 6 lines.
<Dovah> Allegr0: wait, what is your reasoning for leaving?
<[SWAG]Haku> They were LAME antagonists, but I still felt more afraid of them than I did of Sombra
<LunasGuard> i think sombra was a badass
<CriticKitten> You are mistaking your opinion (that the villain of these episodes is "less villainy" than the Flim Flam Brothers) with fact (that the Flim Flam Brothers are NOT villains, but Sombra clearly is(
<CriticKitten> *).
<TaintedSapphire> how much longer do we have to listen to this?
<Yahooz> ...how
<[SWAG]Haku> Ugh CritticKitten youre missing my point
<Yahooz> we still have new people here
<Yahooz> why
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> No History, for a person that means a big deal, is truely not a person
<Yahooz> answer me why
<rainbowfan> A lot of Spike luvers loved how Spike 'saved the day'.
<CriticKitten> No, I get your point, it's just a very dumb point.
<AJIsAwesome> Yahooz: Teh lulz? :3
<Jmo> Cause they want to torment you.
<Time> :)
<PaRappa> Hello!
<Kandarihu> I wanted to know. What Text to Speech program did GigabotHarmonie use tonight?
<Buytoast> because the age of good tidings is gone Yahooz
<thelonepony> Yahooz: not sure *shrugs*
<AJIsAwesome> oh shush, Jmo. :D
<Buytoast> now it's only darkness ahead
<Dashie_Dashie> !cd
<Yahooz> Aint nobody aint got time for this
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Dashie_Dashie> oh tom..
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: no need to insult
<rainbowfan> I say Twi and her friends saved the day, with an assist of spike.
<CriticKitten> You're comparing two vulture capitalists to a guy who enslaved an entire race and saying "yeah, those two are pretty scary"
*AdamTheDuck slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<CrystalPhoenix> [SWAG]Haku, because you had too much fate of Cadence or maybe you couldn't imagine what he could do if he was able to suceed
<Dark_Horst> unknown? why?
<Yahooz> alright then
<fluttershyfan99> that noise is back again!
<rainbowfan> @Tom, it's Saturday @ 10:30 AM EST
<Yahooz> to any newcomers
<Dark_Horst> somebody upsdate tom
<derpyface> congradulations bronies we have created the weirdest meme... GAKGAKGKAGAKGKAGKAKGAKGAKGKAK
<sub06905> tnx for the podcasts here on bronystate Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie <<3
<Dark_Horst> rainbowfan: tom is a bot
<DRHUnleashed> gak gak gak
<wolf> 6_9
<Yahooz> if you'd like to stay, behave, stay classy and have fun
<derpyface> its gak gak gak
<superretroworld> Scoot-Scootaloo: well i dont know to either thank you or be mad at you
<Yahooz> Keep bronystate bronystate
<CriticKitten> Again, I get it. Sombra was a piss poorly written villain who latched onto the most cliche of mannerisms.
<PaRappa> oh. kk
<Dashie_Dashie> that "Gak" shit is getting old.
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> CrystalPhoenix: lol man calm the hell down, you're giving me a heart attack :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> superretroworld: <3
<pony_4357> What's with the gak? That ad is on all the time on the Hub. XD
<GigabotHarmonie> Our twitter is: @pixelponyshow, our email is pixelperfectponyshow@gmail.com
<derpyface> i mean people made gak remix songs and gifs
<rainbowfan> Dark_Horst: thanks for the intel.
<CriticKitten> But it's downright insulting to compare him to the Flim Flam Brothers like they're even remotely in equal tiers.
<fluttershyfan99> but... gak
<AJIsAwesome> Please keep Bronystate classy and your behavior intact. :)
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> derpyface: thats really sad
<Time> What's happening?
<thelonepony> ^^^
<Yahooz> Ah yes, the podcast that happened because VioletVanilla is absent
<Dark_Horst> rainbowfan: you're welcome
<TROctavia> You know what they say, once you go gak you never go back.
<rainbowfan> Did you see the Gak commerciall was run four time s in a row? Gahh!
<CrystalPhoenix> Darkts3|Trader|Snipe, jokes on you I am extremely calm and collected
<AttackWithHugs> Wait, what's happeniung?
<pony_4357> It's because everybody was forced to sit through the ads live
<Kandarihu> Thanks guys for the podcast and the game.
<Yahooz> And only because of that
<CriticKitten> Even implying that slavery and capitalist scams are "equal", even indirectly, is rather insulting. >_>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14We gon' miss you guys ;________;
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<superretroworld> Scoot-Scootaloo: <3
<Yahooz> SaxyPretender: miss who?
<flutterchu> goodbye Allegr0, GigabotHarmonie see you two later
<Gakpony> BAI!
<PaRappa> Bye.
<Kendraco> bye :(
<derpyface> should i buy gak ? advertising really works...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yahooz, Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie are moving home base
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie ;~;
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> CrystalPhoenix: then why are you using your energy to type such things, it sounds like your mind is too simple
<Time> WHAT HAPPENED???
<Stallion_of_War> When does the episode discussion ban end again?
<CriticKitten> Gak is awful. :p
<XAX> Allegr0: Have fun with all 235 of us ;_;
<fluttershyfan99> lol
<[SWAG]Haku> No, I just dont think Sombra made a very good villain. I GET that he was a threat, I GET that was a evil dictator, but from what they showed during the present, not the flashback, he just wasnt very intimidating. When he first appeared, when we didnt see him, was he best part for me. I felt some fear, because I didnt know what he looked liked, what he could do, but then all he did was wait around for a magic wall to come down
<derpyface> gak or floam?
<eillahwolf> Well, who knew that my first show would be my last...?
<Dark_Horst> derpyface: it didnt look very healthy
<hen3ry> they both taste bad
<TROctavia> lol
<DRHUnleashed> i once saw a diary of a wimpy kid commercial 6 times in a row...was horrible
<AJIsAwesome> bye, Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie. Take care and don't forget us. :)
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> yo Swag SHUT UP
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Good luck Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie :)
<CriticKitten> If they're still using the old formula, then it's a carpet stainer, too
<wolf> :'( DONT LEAVE UUUUUUUUUUS
<Yahooz> ...
<Zamer> I'll miss you until i start listening to Celestia tomorrow
<derpyface> *cries for some reason
<Yahooz> you know
<AttackWithHugs> Good luck Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie
<Kandarihu> I'd appreciate if GigabotHarmonie said my name, just so I know how his T2S pronounces it.
<[SWAG]Haku> fine fine fine Illshut up
<Gakpony> OH SHT IM AT THE GS
<Time> Someone answer me...:'(
<Lil> AJ is pretty awesome
<Yahooz> this is just shit
<J_E_Smith71> Allegr0: Will that mean no more random music/video streams? Will you only do them on Celestia Radio?
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> [SWAG]Haku: when people have different opinions, its theirs not yours
<superretroworld> GAK`: oh no, not you, DONT RESTART IT :[
<CriticKitten> Haku: I get that he's not a well written villain. That's entirely different from claiming he's less "scary" than the Flim Flam Brothers.
<Yahooz> everything
<derpyface> dak fak sak
<CriticKitten> Or that he's "less evil" than they are.
<CriticKitten> The latter is decidedly boneheaded.
<[SWAG]Haku> I never said he was less evil!
<SpirittHoove> (\
<TROctavia> He'
<Afflict> oh I've seen that before
<Crazyty10> Who dosen't like gundam every once in a while?
<TROctavia> He'll eventually get to T
<Jmo> Yahooz, you know nothing about being classy. :>
<[SWAG]Haku> Forget it!
<WinterSpeed> I can't find the pinkie face trick
<[SWAG]Haku> Nyeh
<Spyrorocks> lol
<Dashie_Dashie> aw yeah.
<CriticKitten> He's not a bad villain, he's just a cliche villain.
<Gakpony> IM WAITING!!!
<MrPie309> (\
<pony_4357> All these names are so cool
<pony_4357> I need a handle
<Kinixys> Sombre was more of a force of nature, like the Windigo.
<Dark_Horst> that xyzzy game is back online
<Yahooz> Jmo: coming from a chav Australian?
<CriticKitten> "I'm evil because of evil"
<Gakpony> OH SHT I CAN SEE MYSELF
<pony_4357> But I've never been here before
<Jmo> Ohhhhhhh
<MrPie309> I just joined today and i got attached to them a bit
<Jmo> OHHHHHHHHH
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> I love the mute button for ppl
<Gakpony> ALMOST THERE
<WinterSpeed> so many derps
<CriticKitten> Is relatively cliche, but doesn't always mean it's bad.
<Jmo> It's on now marshmallow man.
<[SWAG]Haku> He wasnt a cliche villain, they just didnt show enough of him to make him into a great villain
<flutterchu> Allegr0: GigabotHarmonie thanks for saying my name :)
<Time> What's happening????
<fluttershyfan99> that's me!
<Gakpony> ALMSOT MEH!
<Yahooz> Come at me Jnomo
<Gakpony> THATS ME
<L_Y_R_A> BACK
<TROctavia> This is the first time I've seen this stream, and I'm already going to miss them
<crimson> That was a fun card game BTW
<Buytoast> King Smokey of Northrend wasn't a force of nature
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> crimson: yup
<crimson> i was that crimson
<eillahwolf> THEY SAID MY NAME!!! *squee*
<Buytoast> just some greedy asshat who wanted power
<WinterSpeed> funkballs..
<CriticKitten> No, he was definitely cliche. That much is definitely true. He's generically evil and enslaves a race because....he's evil, and wants to destroy things because....evil
<Time> Who is leaving?????? :[
<L_Y_R_A> IM BACK...YOU CAN SAY MY NAME...i was offline for a bit...
<Zamer> Allegro and Gigabit
<[SWAG]Haku> If Sombra makes a return later, and he gets more screen time, more lines, just more interaction with the ponies, then I will think of him as a greatv villain
<Zamer> they're moving to Celestia Radio
<Kendraco> Lol :D bye guys :(
<fluttershyfan99> I GOT THE KLOBB
<superretroworld> Kendraco:
<CriticKitten> No motivations outlined or anything, just evil. Which can be okay....except the episode was just poorly written in general.
<MrPie309> :'(
<CriticKitten> So it still fell flat.
<L_Y_R_A> yay :P
<DerpyMuffins> How did you get sick in the first place GigabotHarmonie?
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten I think thats something we can agree on
<MrPie309> YEAH!
<CriticKitten> My problem wasn't the villain, though, for once. It was the songs.
<naturesfury> thanks guys im gonna miss you :'(
<CriticKitten> The songs were *pointless*.
<L_Y_R_A> emangamer: where are you?
<Time> Celestia Radio? Will they still do LiveStream?
<CrystalPhoenix> CriticKitten, you want motivation? Desire for power, based on the flashback where he was dictatorship
<AJIsAwesome> CriticKitten: They aren't really memorable, as well.
<[SWAG]Haku> the songs werent great, but they were ok
<superretroworld> naturesfury: your always welocmed back here
<PaRappa> :') My name. im happy.
*Ponies47 Hugs Allegr0 and GigabotHarmonie tightly
<CriticKitten> And I mean *pointless* as in "served absolutely no purpose and come out of nowhere"
<Afflict> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRsAiFhCsE
*AJIsAwesome joins in the group hug
<PaRappa> Parappa The rapper!
<superretroworld> [SWAG]Haku: the crystal ponies song was great
*Zamer joins in
<TROctavia> lmao
<MrPie309> you guys are great ill be sure to check you guys out
<Time> Celestia Radio? Will they still do LiveStream?
<Rosfox> Hai dat me
<[SWAG]Haku> i think the songs were good, but they werent nearly as good assome of the songs of the past
<CrystalPhoenix> my only problem with the songs I had was the lenght
<Silver_Spoon> So long Allegro and Gigabit...I love you guys :( may your endeavors bring you success :)
<CrystalPhoenix> other than that I loved them
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> said my name :$ yay~
<CriticKitten> Most of the songs prior at least have the general purpose of building character or setting a mood, but....well, look at the "Test Song". It's like they tried to make something epic-feeling but it's just not.
<SpirittHoove> (\ GAK 6_9
<DerpyMuffins> Get better GigabotHarmonie, I miss your voice
<L_Y_R_A> GIGA IS STILL HERE!?!?!?
<PaRappa> I am Parappa The rapper and i say you've gotta belive!
<Stallion_of_War> I AM YOUR STALLION OF WAR
<Gakpony> (\GAKFORALL/)
<CrystalPhoenix> especially the reprise of the test song
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Another thing we can agree on
<CriticKitten> It doesn't set the mood given that we already KNOW the mood before that point. We JUST saw the context of the "test", the song makes no sense!
<SpirittHoove> (\ /)
<[SWAG]Haku> It wasnt even really a test!
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> they're still saying names?
<derpyface> WHAT IS THE MUSIC aghh
<J_E_Smith71> The last time I'll get to hear them say my name
<[SWAG]Haku> It was a "Save the World" thing
<CriticKitten> Oh yes, the "test" is just dumb.
<twilight_sprinkle> Allegr0: <3
<TROctavia> my name is an acronym ._.
<Kandarihu> You missed valoreins
<Gakpony> GOODBYE ALL TIME TO DO SOMETHING ELSE!
<XAX> Wub woo too GigabotHarmonie ;_;
<valoreins> wat
<AJIsAwesome> GigabotHarmonie: What about valoreins? :)
<CriticKitten> I think they were going for "self-sacrifice is more important than personal glory" but again, the context murders it.
<[SWAG]Haku> "If you fail, Twilight, you get an F. And also the world ends, but dont worry about that"
<pony_insertnumberher> Anyone realized that cards against humanity game is back on
<wolf> so many names o.o

<WinterSpeed> D'aaaww
<VenHur> D'aaaaww...
<WinterSpeed> ;_;\

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> daawww
<Raerity> feels, feels everywhere
<PaRappa> I am Parappa The rapper and i say you've gotta belive!
<CriticKitten> Haku: It sucks by comparison to the existing material, is what I mean.
<LunasGuard> now im all full of sad
<MrPie309> ik
<[SWAG]Haku> what about Wrek being forbidden?
<Rommulus> I am going to miss Wrek's streams.
<wolf> whats the new site?
<fluttershyfan99> *hug*
<AdamTheDuck> All dem Skype sounds
<TROctavia> one more time
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm going to guess Wrek is streaming?
<Dashie_Dashie> lol
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten why of course
<WinterSpeed> celestia radio
<Rommulus> Nope
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: Domo.
<turp> wut?
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> if Wrek wanted this to repeat, he would put this on Youtuberepeat
<L_Y_R_A> BUFFER
<CriticKitten> The episode has plenty of individual problems but the biggest and most overarching is....it's just poorly written.
<weeping_pegasi82> aw well
<DRHUnleashed> i remember this show
<Pegasister> bufferrr
<LunasGuard> :'(
<Time> BUFF
*weeping_pegasi82 threatens the buffer
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Dude, I dont like agreeing with you. Stop making good points.
<Buytoast> just because it's art and such doesn't make it wreck it wrek streamin
<wolf> buffer
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> CriticKitten: Lauren needs to fire some writers, its slowly been a problem
<Pegasister> :[
<TROctavia> I will say I enjoyed the musical reprise at the very end
<DomoDomo> I was going to type this in a word doc, but I'll do it live.
<Pegasister> :'(:'(:'(
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> wow this is lagging a lot
<TROctavia> it received all my feels as a musician
<Kandarihu> I didn't see any problem in the storyline.
<wolf> BUFFER
<CriticKitten> Poorly written even beyond Mare Do Well, really. The narrative falls flat on its face from moment one.
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Kandarihu: U shore?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: well if its expanded, it could work good. but as a standalone premiere, its not very good, yes
<wolf> buffer
<[SWAG]Haku> CriticKitten Ok, I just dont like agreeing with people at all

<PSP> GAK GAK
<Stallion_of_War> Oi, I liked the premier; it had Luna; Celestia and Twilight used Dark Magic
<MrPie309> I will totaly check des guys out
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Now see, that's what I'm HOPING will happen. I'd like to have Sombre be the main villain for the entire season, manipulating events and eventually be revealed in the finale.
<Stallion_of_War> crap
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Gak is going to become one of those meme's where if ppl keep repeating it. It just gets tiring and no one will care in the future
<Stallion_of_War> SORRY
<CriticKitten> But I don't expect them to do that.
<hen3ry> Going to become? Wrong verb tense there, Darkts3.
<superretroworld> Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: shhhhhh
<derpyface> anyone lagging?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: yeah thats what i thought couldve worked, his design is cool at least
<CriticKitten> But right now, from what we know, it's just bad.
<flutterchu> MrPie309: huh.........2000mrpie?.....it's me....BuildermanVSNotch
<twilight_sprinkle> at least in smoke form
<Time> Who will broadcat now? :(
<derpyface> bye guys
<derpyface> farewell
<derpyface> *cries
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, derpyface. :)
<Rommulus> What intrigued me at the end of the episode was that there was a book.
<Kinixys> Anyone to play cards against humanity?
<thelonepony> Bye derpyface :)
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> hen3ry: and you would care about that?
<AdamTheDuck> hen3ry, http://fav.me/d5alsso
<CriticKitten> First off, the "test" not only isn't a test, but even if you twisted your logic to consider it one, it's an AWFUL test.
<derpyface> bye everypony..
<flutterchu> good bye......
*WinterSpeed cries in a corner
<Pegasister> buffer'
<Kinixys> Bye derpyface
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Someone else will stream in a while~
<CriticKitten> Rommulus: inb4 Ponynomicon
<hen3ry> Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: I meant to say it's not a future tense you wanted - it's already overdone
<TROctavia> bai
<flutterchu> y'know i was part of the reason we were called motherfuckingpixels
<twilight_sprinkle> Time: domo was broadcasting, but for some reason its buffering atm
<Dashie_Dashie> everyday I'm bufferin'
*AttackWithHugs huggles Scoot-Scootaloo
<PaRappa> Buffer up!
<Domo> I just did that for a split second, im done now
<MrPie309> Now what?!
