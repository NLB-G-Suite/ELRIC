<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andreas Deja based Jafar on Marc Davis's design for Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty (1959). The two villains share more than just looks: both carry a staff which they use to execute evil magic; both have bird henchman (Maleficent's is a raven, Jafar's a parrot), and both turn themselves into gigantic animals in their films' climatic battles
<Revolver> This is BGM from the actual game.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In early visual development, Aladdin resembled Michael J. Fox. As the film developed,Jeffrey Katzenberg didn't think Aladdin had enough appeal to women, so he asked that Aladdin be beefed up a bit to resemble Tom Cruise.

<Applejack0> Hells yeah.
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Jafar at first was more hot-tempered, while Iago was a cool, haughty British type. The filmakers felt that having Jafar losing his temper too much made him less menacing, so the personalities of the two characters were switched around.

<Hegehhhhh> Froze
<desertman2> !
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Because Robin Williams ad-libbed so many of his lines, the script was turned down for a Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award nomination. John Candy, Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy were all considered at one point to provide the voice of the Genie.
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Only then can he be truly fabulous
<NAFEDUDE> ...
<Hipster_Brony> 8can you do that? can you die twice?
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: This was the first major animated film which was advertised on the strength of having a major movie star providing one of its voices (Robin Williams in this case). This has since become the norm with animated features.

<MonsieurLeFlour> 0He's not GREAT and POWERFUL enough
<Hegehhhhh> Ninja wizard artificier sultan sorcerer singer genie
<Nightmare_Moon> Nah, not epic enough
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The idea of adapting the Aladdin story as a Disney animated musical was first proposed by Howard Ashman in 1988 at the time that he and Alan Menken were still working onThe Little Mermaid (1989) and before work had begun on Beauty and the Beast (1991). Ashman wrote an initial treatment for the project and collaborated on six songs with
<Silverscreen> 11with Menken. When John Musker and Ron Clements finished directing duties on The Little Mermaid, they turned their attention to writing a first draft of this film's script, and eventually became its directors.
<Apokalipse> obviously not

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: On what came to be known among the Aladdin animators as Black Friday, then Disney head Jeffrey Katzenberg told the team to scrap virtually everything they'd been working on for months and start all over again. He also refused to move the film's release date. Directors John Musker and Ron Clements were able to completely
<Silverscreen> 11turn around the film's new plot and screenplay in just eight days.

<SillyNilly> NAFEDUDE, welcome to IRC!
<damasta> :D Huzzah
<CogWeaver> Nightmare_Moon: I know, but you also have to admit when a person is simply misinformed and ARE capable of doing something. They simply need a better way of it being explained or it repeated to them a few more times until they process what's being said to them in entirety
<Nightmare_Moon> irc is not a difficult thing to learn =P I don't understand why people are afraid of it.

<Dumori> Yeah rube I'll try and roll up a char tomorrow morning or be for I hit the hay I'm pooped loong day

<prince-dari> Damn, I can barely walk. XD
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Lets see what nicknaems do i have... Muffin_Overlord_Derpy - Evil_Overlord_Celestia - Cupcake_Overlord_Pinkie - Animal_Overlord_Fluttershy - Knowledge_Overlord_Twilght
<damasta> Nope. Someone added a sequel. "Muffins"
<Celestial> lolwhy
<ZekeS> damasta: . . . . . . . . .
<Retsamoreh> Cause they can, I assume.
<damasta> Because the first was great. :P
<damasta> I mean. O_O Uh.....
<Retsamoreh> And the first was mediocre.
<Silverscreen> 11Damn. Pinkie kicks ass at Tic Tac Toe
<pony_yay> Damn you suck Rarity...
<Flamerunner> Fire_Overlord_Flamerunner
<CogWeaver> Derpy, you need a nick for Rarity and RD
<rubenflonne12> alrigth cool
<Barry> Wait, if Rarity doesn't like mud unless it's imported, how did she and Pinkie play tic tac toe?
<ZekeS> damasta: . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Its a running joke
<muffin_hooves> Fluttershy must have a thick hide.
<CogWeaver> but not AJ
<damasta> *licks lips, burys key, builds house on top of hole, lives in house*
<CogWeaver> AJ is MINE
<desertman2> Installing skype right now
<damasta> LOCKS
<pony_yay> I mean, how do you lose tic tac toe?

<Benjamin> 0thank Celestia she made it across that gaping chasm.
<Fire_Overlord_Flamerunner> should i register this name?
<Barry> If you couldn't lose in Tic Tac Toe, you couldn't win either
<Nikita> Hey guys I'm new to this channel, Question: Where should I put fanfic wishes?
<B-Man> That, or Diamond_Overlord_Rarity
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Bon-Bon Overlord Lyra??
<Fire_Overlord_Flamerunner> Apples_Overlord_Applejack
<Celestial> Orchard_overlord_Applejack?
<prince-dari> Only if the other person couldn't lose either.
<CogWeaver> Nikita: Fanic discussions mainly happen in #EquestrianStudy
<Arcesious> it's hilarious that Fluttershy's voice partly causes the avalalanche...
<CogWeaver> but if they're just short little blurbs or ideas you can discuss them here
<Cocaine_Overlord_CharlieSheen> LOL.
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Fluttershy, you're such a loudmouth....
<pony_yay> Damn quick time events...
<damasta> Lol, I was explaining "The fanfic that shalt not be named" to a friend who hasn't watched the show, and they thought I was explaining one of the episodes. xD
<Arcesious> because she's so quiet.
<Barry> A common element of cartoons, a loud voice doesn't cause an avalanche, but a semi-quiet sigh does
<muffin_hooves> Applejack is good at sticking her hoof in other's mouths.
<Retsamoreh> Question, if you were forced to smite any one pony from the mane six, who would it be?
<Angel_Espeon> 13!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Angel_Espeon, you are a 3Luxio.
<CogWeaver> Rarity
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> STOP TAKING MY IDEAS!

<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
<NickBrony123> thats a waste of good ammo
<ivan2294> In order to make that related, we need ghost recon ponies
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Now that I think about it, they do look a bit like Cadian shock troops
<Hipster_Brony> 8INCEPTION MUSIC
<rubenflonne12> of course its always a good idea :D

<SirSprinkles> 6Coffee is coffe
<Apokalipse> it's glass from the future
<Misery> that actually affects taste?
<muffin_hooves> Ego much?
<SirSprinkles> 6That's all that matters
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0>Implying coffee doesn't already taste horrible
<Misery> i dont drink coffee i wouldent know
<Hipster_Brony> 8except you steered us into a damn asteroid!
<Benjamin> 0coffee from a glass mug is actually dangerous.
<Misery> why
<muffin_hooves> Coffee rules.
<SirSprinkles> 6MonseiurLeFlour, you have disgraced yourself
<NickBrony123> All you got to add a cup of sugar to that cooffe
<Benjamin> 0since the heat might cause the glass to shatter
<NAFEDUDE> wut that^
<Hipster_Brony> 8glass can shatter at high heat
<MFW> It was nice working with you all.

<ivan2294> GTA:Ponyville
<Benjamin> 0Why not just nuke them?
<JackiePie> Hi
<ivan2294> We need that.
<ivan2294> Hi
<JackiePie> How goes it?
<Huge> Go away.
<Flamerunner> Grand Theft Carriot
<ivan2294> lol
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0The exterminatus! It does nothing!
<rubenflonne12> they use nuke warfare you will see
<anoponymous> 0bug asteroid? send it to the moon!
<Misery> because they can survive nukes
<Flamerunner> Libertree City Stories
<Hipster_Brony> 8nuke it from orbit, its the only way to be sure
<Benjamin> 0Tyranids vs ponies
<JackiePie> What's a carriot?
<Darf14> Too bad they do it in the 3rd movie
<AppleDashWINS> you know what i just noticed?
<Flamerunner> charriot*
<RarityIsntLettingYouGetAway> Great Timing Carl
<Misery> =/
<JackiePie> Ah
<ivan2294> The question is, do you hijack it by pulling the carraig, or the person riding it.
<AppleDashWINS> They're using the same banner for the third time!
<Angel_Espeon> 13That movie was amazing ;w;
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Not even hive mind is immune to the magic of friendship
<JackiePie> They're not Google.
<Abalidoth> I think this is the new "default" banner.
<Benjamin> 0Tyranids fought ponies in the third Starship troopers?
<Hipster_Brony> 8DRAMATIC RIP
<ivan2294> We have a default banner?
<JackiePie> I like it
<prince-dari> What is it good for?
<rubenflonne12> WAR!!
<NickBrony123> Oh god a dead pony
<ivan2294> Also, what's wrong with google? > : (
<AppleDashWINS> It's an innuendo isn't it?
<ninjapwny> yea
<JackiePie> It's um, honest?
<ninjapwny> they had that les paul banner
<AppleDashWINS> "Corrupting little girls' tv"
<Benjamin> 0Such is life in Equestria
<ninjapwny> like 2 days ago
<prince-dari> Absolutely nothing.
*AppleDashWINS PP, RD, RR bending over
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lL9F4wiOQ
*AppleDashWINS AJ, FS looking on in... shock.
<JackiePie> Then they had the eclipse Google Doodle
<Cynder7> 6*icyhug*
<AppleDashWINS> that one was cool
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Tried bug spray?
<TurniBrony> The only good Griffon is a dead Griffon.
<rubenflonne12> bugs trying to invade earth, send them to the moon
<AppleDashWINS> Les Paul?
<Flamerunner> syrup, painkillers, cigarettes, weed, hennesy, vodka.
<MFW> OH its him
<NickBrony123> They should of Use Bug spary
<Flamerunner> hana ha haaaaaaaa
<AppleDashWINS> the gutar?
<Icy> *cyndercyndered*
<Misery> instead of coming up with a plan they head straight into the heart of bugs
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<SirSprinkles> 6...GAWD THIS MOVIE IS LONG
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Psychic powers are a no-no
<Benjamin> 0Do your part
<JackiePie> I was thinking about what if Google did a MLP FiM doodle if the show becomes popular enough for that
<Benjamin> 0Buy War bonds
<NickBrony123> how?
<NooPony> I wish I had some cigarettes right now
*Cynder7 6has been cyndered.
<TurniBrony> Not long enough.
<nido> I don't like the corruping little girls part. this is the 'bright' side f the fandom
<Abalidoth> For the show's first anniversary or something, maybe?
<SirSprinkles> 6Still another hour...
<NAFEDUDE> bye guyz
<ivan2294> Why do people hate OC ponies again?
<JackiePie> nido, someone has to do it.
<Apokalipse> seriously?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Apokalipse> aww
<AppleDashWINS> Yah, the OC ponies here are awesome!
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Eating bugs is heresy
<Apokalipse> hey look it's Bart again
<SirSprinkles> 6I've seen it twice already, so I'm not even watching.
<NickBrony123> Whats the nexzt movie after this?
<AppleDashWINS> It's their Mary Sue/Gary Stu-ness that sets people ff
<SirSprinkles> 6This is the last movie.
<JackiePie> Hi Danfish.
<SirSprinkles> 6After this is post-show.
<NickBrony123> oh
<ivan2294> ?
<ivan2294> Mary Sue what now?
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is whatever I decide to stream, really.
<Hipster_Brony> 8IM FROM PONYVILLE AND I SAY LOVE EM ALL
<Benjamin> 0"We are gonna nuke these bugs kawabunga"
<TurniBrony> I'd still have three hours of giant bugs than three hours of Blue Man Group.
<SirSprinkles> 6Mostly PMVs
<MFW> To me carmen doesnt look...
<AppleDashWINS> Mary-Sue = cliche, cookie-cutter, possibly god-mod OC
<Benjamin> 0The only way to kill a hug is through hugs.
<MFW> whats the word
<MFW> smart
<AppleDashWINS> can even be Canon char if badly written
<ivan2294> Oh that
<JackiePie> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue
<Abalidoth> Maybe I've been hanging out in different bits of the fandom, but I haven't noticed a lot of godmoding among OC ponies.
<Abalidoth> Some, sure.
<AppleDashWINS> well, it's ponies. XD
<AppleDashWINS> now in the SONIC fandom...
<Hipster_Brony> 8dumb bitch
<AppleDashWINS> XDD
<NooPony> Well, most people tend to give their ponies wings and horns
<ivan2294> Ha
<ivan2294> Sonic OCs
<rubenflonne12> all foot soldiers don't have smarts, they don't need them anyways x3 only combat smarts
<Cynder7> 6*icypoke*
<Abalidoth> REally?
<AppleDashWINS> I had a Sonic oc, then he just became an oc
<Benjamin> 0Rifle = brain
<NickBrony123> Hip fire for the win
<NooPony> And I think that's something only Celestia and Luna should have
<rubenflonne12> quite
<ivan2294> Yes
<JackiePie> Okay what does OC mean?
<Benjamin> 0Fight for the honour of your unit!
<Abalidoth> Hm. I haven't noticed a lot of alicorn OC ponies. Once again, possibly just different bits of the fandom.
<ivan2294> original Character
<MFW> looks like MC lost
<AppleDashWINS> i know a lot of Sonic OC's and the good ones aren't Mary-sue-ish at all but still, the inexperienced ones...
<JackiePie> Alright, thanks
<TurniBrony> Disregard rank, aquire bruises
<JackiePie> Hi
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0This movie gets so much better when you think Imperial Guards VS Tyranids.
<Misery> lol
<Dumori> LOL
<Dumori> they form some weird ass imperial world I guess still
<Dumori> *from
<Icy> Mmmmmmm *rolls arounds on the groud*
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0I thought she said forget it, Rainbow
<rubenflonne12> lol xD warhammer
<Benjamin> 0Imperial Guard and Imperial Navies don't mix
<AppleDashWINS> Also, Steampunk ftw
<ivan2294> I would rather just stick to the ground if I could draw
<Flamerunner> i'm on apples, cupcakes, pies, muffin, cakes, coca-cola.
<Thaluka> I think most people know not to make alicorns and such
<SirSprinkles> 6Warhammer 40k is win
<Flamerunner> i'm on everything.
<NickBrony123> what going on with the video quailty
<Misery> i love the 40k games
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Tyranids are win
<Benjamin> 0Why so heretic Le Flour?
<Nightmare_Moon> For the most part, most oc ponies have been decently thought out, I've not seen many alicorns or wildishly outragous ponies
<NooPony> I don't really get the whole RP thing anyway
<Arcesious> worst time for lag
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Heretics have more fun
<MFW> ikr
<SirSprinkles> 6Tyranids are AMAZING
<ivan2294> If I had an OC pony I would stick to being earth, seems normal for me.
<AppleDashWINS> Some in the Drawfriend are overdone, though...
<AppleDashWINS> like the Death Pony
<Flamerunner> Nightmare... your sister...
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Dem zoanthropes
*Flamerunner points to Celestia
<ivan2294> Although I don't have an OC pony because of two reasons
<rubenflonne12> chaos soldiers
<Benjamin> 0Heresy Heresy Everywhere!
<ivan2294> I prefer to be human
<ivan2294> And I can't draw
<Nightmare_Moon> What about my sister?
<Arcesious> hell no don't you lag on me, what with your awesome spaceships and stuff!
<NooPony> I prefer staying anonymous anyway
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Well, S10 Ap1 Lance, can't really compete with that
<Thaluka> Something like a "Death Pony" is gonna be incompatible with canon any, doesn't matter how over-the-top you go with it.
<ivan2294> YOU ARE THE SAME BEING
<SirSprinkles> 6Dude, I have a friend that will RAEP you with tyranids.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, epically.
*Cynder7 6watches Icy with a look of wtf on her face.
<Abalidoth> I'd be a unicorn, because magic is awesome.
<Darf14> The army should have brought a giant can of Raid to the fight.
<NooPony> Same
<ivan2294> I prefer science
<AppleDashWINS> My OC is Earht Poni
<Nightmare_Moon> Thaluka, the Ponies of the Apocolypse are real, and you'll do well to remember that.
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Francis voice: I hate Necron Monoliths
<SirSprinkles> I'd just like to state for the record. I'm not streaming when we do LotR.
<ivan2294> And NOT just because of ponies
<NooPony> Though it seems like most unicorns can't control their magic nearly as good as Twilight
<TurniBrony> Nope.avi
<Abalidoth> Living in Equestria, though, the careful study of magic IS science.
<WhatPayne> Hey it's ODST... wai...
<ivan2294> No, they just specialize in one aspect
<Misery> remember laser tag and knife throwing and you'll live
<Abalidoth> Twilight is, for all intents and purposes, a theoretical physicist.
<MFW> What mistake
<AppleDashWINS> I'm trying to minimize my OC's because while i have more freedon in their personalities than canon, i need to be extra-careful
<ivan2294> But like spike said, Twilights talent is magic in general
<Benjamin> 0quick! Throw your knives at it!
<NooPony> More like a practical physicist
<anoponymous> 0shit's on fire
<Nightmare_Moon> Most unicorns are I can do everything. Unicorns are supposed to excell above all at one specific skill
<Hipster_Brony> lol
<Apokalipse> kablamo
<Icy> *trollface*
<AppleDashWINS> TS's Element should be Logic

<ivan2294> Also, most pegasi are people like RD

<Nightmare_Moon> Twilight can do everything, but that doesn't mean she can do it well
<Rafasde> ...sayin'.

<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> MuffinS!
<Misery> i love how they had no real plan
<ivan2294> CivPony... I would play that.
<NickBrony123> Need more supply
<AppleDashWINS> OC Ponies
<Ghosties> 4DCD should probably be available for that
<Nightmare_Moon> Earth ponies: Superior in strength, stamina and durability
<ivan2294> That's the topic?
<Misery> they thought they could just go in and shoot every bug to death on their own home planet
<Arcesious> marine rushes don't work lul
<Benjamin> 0you call that big? I faced a Bloodthirster, now thats big.

<Darf14> They do have a plan, and it involves charging at the enemy
<NooPony> Why are you writing in bold?
<ivan2294> But it's still in the topic thing
<AppleDashWINS> Pegasi; speed, extreme personality
<ivan2294> WHY NOT
<AppleDashWINS> Extreme meaning... well, look at RD and FS
<ivan2294> You see I don't like that.
<rubenflonne12> by the way fair warning, this tarren player sucks :D
<Benjamin> 0They should have standard bearers
<User_5842> X-treme

<Benjamin> 0SHOW THEM YOUR TATOOS!
<AppleDashWINS> Extreme as in, TOO calm and quiet
<Chatoyant> fluttershy can be pretty extreme.
<Nightmare_Moon> No pegasus can do what Fluttershy can.
<Abalidoth> Well, any argument for unicorns OR pegasi could also apply to alicorns, so they're objectively the "best". Pretty exclusive club though.
<Nickbrony123> More Speed and Dexterity
<ivan2294> She doesn't like speed.
<Chatoyant> extremely psycho.

<Rafasde> Thaluka is right

<Abalidoth> With the same/similar personality.
<combustiblelemons> Steven magnet actually
<ivan2294> Whoever the best pony is, it is NOT A PONY
<combustiblelemons> I agree
<Thaluka> Adult dragons, thus far, seem completely useless. They sit in a cave with treasure like Smaug.
<DragonRage> We underestimated their ability to kill us in horrible, horrible ways.
<combustiblelemons> :D
<AppleDashWINS> John Lennon is the best pony

<TurniBrony> :P
<ivan2294> We have plenty of food with our orchards and supply trains
<combustiblelemons> sand isn't the best for digging tunnels through
<Rafasde> AVeryStrange, that's a good opinion of yours.
<Benjamin> 0Dixieland played on green space violin
<Rafasde> Did it worked?
<combustiblelemons> especially dry sand
<combustiblelemons> in deserts
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Ponies are good for the men's morale
<ivan2294> Deserts aren't entirely sand, ever been to the grand canyon?
<AVeryStrange> I mean look at Dragonshy where she takes charge and helps out Fluttershy
<NickBrony123> INdeed
<ivan2294> Some of this stuff is pretty tough
<Ghosties> 4God, I can hear that goddamn bass over my headphones at full volume. Fucking assholes next door

<ivan2294> Water? I already told you, supply trains remember?
<Rarity0> Revolver: My reason to go to the Gala? TO watch Trollestia at her best

<MFW> no sex yet

<Rafasde> Lemons' logic is actually pretty accurate O_O

<RainbowCrash> i meant like a trailer
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Fucking jump infantry
<Benjamin> 0atleast they helped him
<ivan2294> No, have you ever seen the episode where they go to Appleloosa?
<rubenflonne> sniper ghost :D
<NINJAPWNY> oh
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm waiting for my stomach to growl so loud that somepony near me gives me food.
<NINJAPWNY> yea
<Celes> yeah, well maybe the elements were created by Cel+Luna
<ivan2294> They have an entire orchard
<combustiblelemons> *ahem* may I also quote "winter wrap up" "but the food we've stored is runnin' out
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<NickBrony123> some shouda quick scoped
<NINJAPWNY> that would still be SO AWESOME
<Celes> they had the intention of ruling in harmony after all
<Rarity0> Revolver: Apples STILL need water. Embargo the rebels!
<RainBroDash> :< Sprinkles I'll donate some food hehe
<ivan2294> Winter wrap up?
<ivan2294> wat
<combustiblelemons> yes but TREES CAN'T GROW WITHOUT WATER AND SUN.
<rubenflonne> i would donate some money later when i get the chance
<NINJAPWNY> *gives the rebels water*
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, i know that feel bro
<RainBroDash> Come England, have a bacon sandwich dude
<Rafasde> Oh god, Lemons TEACH ME YOUR WAYS TO ARGUE MASTER
<AVeryStrange> Celestia can't have created the elements. She only used 5, not all 6.
<RainBroDash> on me
<combustiblelemons> lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8i forgot to eat dinner last night
<Hipster_Brony> 8ITS A TRAP!
<RainBroDash> Last night didn't really exist for me
<Benjamin> 0everything is better with Bacon
<Nickbrony123> but according to the Intro of the first episode she gather them so they existed be for that
<combustiblelemons> eventually you'll run out of water too
<rubenflonne> i agree
<ivan2294> It sounds like an embargo is easy enough
<RainBroDash> I slept this afternoon, woke up at 10pm
<ivan2294> But that didn't work in other guerilla wars now did it
<combustiblelemons> surrender ivan.
<Celes> huh? only 5?
<AVeryStrange> Only 5 were known
<ivan2294> NEVAH
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Bacon wrapped in bacon sprinkled with little pieces of bacon
<RainBroDash> the stream was just too good last night, couldn't go to bed
<NINJAPWNY> yea
<Rafasde> Ivan is respondig very well
<Rafasde> *responding
<NINJAPWNY> TS is the avatar
<combustiblelemons> *all earth ponies starve to death*
<AVeryStrange> She put them on stands and everything
<Nickbrony123> so how did it work last time then?
<NINJAPWNY> she unites all the other elements
<ivan2294> >implying you choose our fate
<combustiblelemons> This smells like victory!
<Arcesious> dang lag...
<Darf14> A lot of dead bodies, nothing suspicious here
<AVeryStrange> Perhaps they can be used without being complete
<User_8138> I never noticed this...
<anoponymous> 0i couldnt stay past 3am :3
<SirSprinkles> 6I had a sandwich this morning, other than that, haven't had anything since Thursday morning.
<Rafasde> Lemons...
<Silverscreen> I'm back.
<Benjamin> 0DAS LAG
<AVeryStrange> I mean they could have individual power
<combustiblelemons> yeeees?
<Arcesious> keeps dropping me...
<RainBroDash> BroDashRain, we meet again.
<AVeryStrange> It's rather a lot of speculation.
<Rafasde> If the Earth Ponies die, the Pasi will eat what? Clouds?
<BroDashRain> ahaha
<BroDashRain> mwahahaha
<NINJAPWNY> yes
<RainBroDash> ;D <3
<Rafasde> *Pegasi
<Rafasde> Darn it
<combustiblelemons> they can grow their own crops silly
<Rarity0> Revolver: We have floating islands, duh.
<combustiblelemons> what's stopping them lol
<Rafasde> Really?
<NINJAPWNY> clouds are part of a nutricious breakfast
<Rarity0> Revolver: Although, if we can STAND on clouds....
<NickBrony123> more like an heros
<Nightmare_Moon> I see the elemtns of Harmony as the manifestation of the 5 emotions that make up frienship. Magic simply binds the world together as the 6th making it the odd one out. Which then in turn makes my theory rocky. Anyway, the elements would've first come into existance at the dawn of society.
<ivan2294> Okay lemme explain this, we CAN grow food in the desert, Appleloosa proved it. We also have supply trains coming from all over equestria, and not everyone will listen to your embargo.
<combustiblelemons> Don't forget the unicorns are with us too.
<BlankFlankBrony|assist> They're just not as good as earth ponies at farming.
<Hipster_Brony> okie dokie loki
<Nightmare_Moon> Delayed post, but I was afk
<combustiblelemons> Ivan...
<BroDashRain> xD <3
<combustiblelemons> WATER AND SUNLIGHT make trees grow
<AVeryStrange> I was wondering during "Sonic Rainboom" how the pegasi can keep simple things like clothes from falling through the clouds when they hand them up in their cloud furniture.
<combustiblelemons> without that your trees die
<combustiblelemons> without those trees you die
<Hipster_Brony> 8OH
<Rafasde> But... the Pegasi food spply is produced by the Earth Ponies. If they all die at the war, all Pegasi will starve before haing a chance of planting.
<ivan2294> And we have plenty of BOTH
<Hipster_Brony> 8MY
<Hipster_Brony> 8GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
<NickBrony123> Bitch slap
<NINJAPWNY> u can still get water in the desert
<Rarity0> Revolver; Everyone will listen to our embargo if you threaten Pegasi as a RACE!
<combustiblelemons> Not all earth ponies
<Benjamin> 0BEES
<ivan2294> Deserts have plenty of sunlight
<NINJAPWNY> irrigation FTW
<AVeryStrange> Nightmare_Moon: The sixth element is magic, which as we've been told, is friendship. The sixth element is friendship.
<Benjamin> 0IN MY EYES
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0MY EYES
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
<combustiblelemons> Really what stops other ponies from growing crops
<ivan2294> I never threatened teh RACE, I AM AGAINST OUR ORPESSORS
<combustiblelemons> nothing
<Benjamin> 0Do you want to repeat tired old cliches forever?!
<Arcesious> they're doomed
<ivan2294> THE UNICORNS ARE THE ONES THAT MUST DIE
<Darf14> Someone call pest control
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Yup
<Nightmare_Moon> AVeryStrange: Which could only come into existance once the first 5 were created and united, as per the creation myth in the pilot
<ivan2294> PEGASI ARE JUST PUPPETS
<Rafasde> Damn, I'm acting like an Earth Pony! No, I'm a PEGASUS!
<combustiblelemons> lauren faust said herself they're simply better at doing it
<Rarity0> Revolver: How are Pegusi opressing ponies again?
<prince-dari> Why not just blow up all the planets with bugs on?
<ZekeS> combustiblelemons: author's saving throw :p
<ivan2294> Unicorns are
<combustiblelemons> Victory!
<prince-dari> DEATH STAR!
<ivan2294> Also, I forgot where the image was
<Benjamin> 0wouldn't flamethrowers be really useful here?
<rubenflonne> thats no moon thats the death star, quick send it to the moon :D
<combustiblelemons> :D
<RainBroDash> been running my tripcode generator for 50 hours, querying a 7-letter tripcode, not case-sensitive.
<RainBroDash> 2 results :P
<ivan2294> victory how?
<AVeryStrange> Nightmare_Moon: eeeexcept where did Celestia get that spark of friendship? And also, why did she allow knowledge of five but not six? I'm not sure.
<SirSprinkles> 6...
<anoponymous> 0they need some siege tanks
<Nightmare_Moon> But, what is unclear is this, is it required to be a unicorn to harness the element of magic? If a Pegasus or an Earth pony weilded it, would they be suddenly magical unicornesque critters?
<prince-dari> Sprinkles is insanely fast.
<Nickbrony123> aren't the ponies destorying the natural balance of nature by intervening ?
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Disregard flamers, allow cover saves.
<AVeryStrange> You know what Imma find the clip of the origin story.
<combustiblelemons> i win the war
<rubenflonne> or firebats which ever
<ivan2294> how?
<combustiblelemons> by starving you all to death
<ivan2294> You haven't answered anything I said
<ivan2294> Starving how?
<combustiblelemons> ...
<ivan2294> We have orchards
<ivan2294> and water
<SirSprinkles> 6I've been running my tripcode generator for 2 weeks, querying a 10-letter tripcode, not case-sensitive.
<NickBrony123> They should have turrets of something
<ivan2294> and supply trains
<SirSprinkles> 6No results.
<Rafasde> Nick, in their world the nature does her balance herself only at wild places.
<combustiblelemons> how do trees grow without sunlight
<ivan2294> and not everyone listens to your embargoes
<Rarity0> Revolver: *salute* Heil Kommander Lemon!
<RainBroDash> hahaha so unlucky sprinks
<RainBroDash> xD
<combustiblelemons> you run out of food eventually
<Silverscreen> 11I tried the same, Sprinkles. I Gave up on it.
<ivan2294> orchards GROW
<prince-dari> Not really unlucky.
<Rarity0> Revolver: Sieg Heil!
<Rafasde> = Everfree Forest
<Nickbrony123> ok
<Nightmare_Moon> AVeryStrange: Its very easy to simply assume sister didn't have the 6th element when I was banished, or else she would've released me from Luna right then and there.
<prince-dari> I'd expect it to take forever. :P
<rubenflonne> hehe funny thing, this is the only movie that lags, all others did not x3
<Rarity0> Revolver: Like I said, FLOATING ISLANDS>
<SirSprinkles> 6It's because it's currently generating in the Rs, and the trip I need is in the As.
<Nickbrony123> I am so living in the everfree forest
<RainBroDash> yeah, me too. But it's 2 weeks!
<ivan2294> Floating islands? dafuq
<combustiblelemons> Plants + sunlight = photosynthesis = food for plants
<RainBroDash> and fair enough haha
<Flamerunner> [17:48] Siriusgamer: hey man
<Flamerunner> [17:48] Siriusgamer: one of my friends is a bronie
<Flamerunner> [17:49] Siriusgamer: how do i handle this situation
<Flamerunner> [17:50] MortalPenguin0X: ...
<Flamerunner> [17:50] MortalPenguin0X: Dunno
<Flamerunner> [17:50] MortalPenguin0X: IF he doesn't try to convert you
<Flamerunner> [17:50] MortalPenguin0X: everything's fine
<Flamerunner> [17:50] Siriusgamer: he did
<Flamerunner> [17:50] Siriusgamer: hes like
<Flamerunner> [17:50] MortalPenguin0X: then run like hell.
<Flamerunner> [17:50] Siriusgamer: YOU GOTTA WATCH DIS SHIT MAN
<combustiblelemons> don't forget about all the land you guys abandoned ivan
<Flamerunner> [17:50] Siriusgamer: and im like NO MAN
<ivan2294> True, everfree is also a good base
<Flamerunner> a normal day in Xfire
<combustiblelemons> we use that too
<combustiblelemons> you're stuck in a useless desert.
<SirSprinkles> 6I have more Rarity trips than any humen could possibly need.
<ivan2294> Clouds move on their own
<Rarity0> Revolver: Or GIANT MOUNTAINS or something...
<ivan2294> You can't have a safe base
<ivan2294> without clouds
<Rarity0> Revolver: No, the don't.
<combustiblelemons> Celestia changes that bro
<Arcesious> the lag is ruining it...
<RainBroDash> I've already had one decent one generated for what I wanted, and I use that. Just looking for some more if I ever want them
<Rarity0> *they
<ivan2294> We are experts at ground combat
<Nickbrony123> and so many undiscover thing that ay ion the everfree forest
<AVeryStrange> Intro doesn't clear it up - there is a scene with only 5 elements however
<combustiblelemons> if not....
<ivan2294> So fighting us without a cloud base is suicide
<SirSprinkles> 6I use my DONUT one currently.
<Nightmare_Moon> let me recheck the intro
<combustiblelemons> well lets just say it isn't safe in the everfree forest
<Arcesious> are you kidding me? That's 14 times this thing has dropped me today!
<ivan2294> We'll manage
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like the donut one
<ivan2294> We did in the desert
<combustiblelemons> you'll all be mauled to death by creatures one by one.
<Rarity0> Revolver: We CONTROL the clouds. We are the Pegusi. (/DUne 200 referance over)
<ivan2294> AND UNDER THE OPRESSIVE RULE OF THE UNICORNS
<Nickbrony123> you just need to use your survive skill and youll be fine
<RainBroDash> I wanted one with rainbow in it, managed to get raINbow.0s
<ivan2294> Clouds aren't natural in the everfree
<Rafasde> What are "Pegusi"?
<RainBroDash> so all is good so far :3
<ivan2294> You should know that
<Rarity0> *Pegasi
<combustiblelemons> So, you're now banished to the everfree forest
<ivan2294> RD said so
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Searching for one with Rainbow right now
<Rafasde> Ivan is right
<Arcesious> My name is too long for a tripcode
<Arcesious> 9 letters.
<ivan2294> Our bases are in the everfree and the desert
<Benjamin> 0USE YOUR KNIFE
<Rafasde> Pegasi can't control weather on wild places such as Everfree forest
<combustiblelemons> *sighs*
<Rarity0> Revolver: Places you can't control?
<SirSprinkles> 6Trips generate 10 letters
<AVeryStrange> Rafasde: You're extrapolating
<combustiblelemons> yep but theres wild animals in it
<NickBrony123> Reload !!!
<combustiblelemons> that are dangerous
<Rafasde> I am? How? Please tell me.
<ivan2294> We send rebels to infiltrate equestria and sabatoge important strategic locations in pegasi adn unicorn territory
<AMereLurker> Hi everypony!
<combustiblelemons> and kill ponies.
<Benjamin> 0in the future, you don't need to reload
<Nightmare_Moon> AVeryStrange: In the opening sequence, they show the pedistal with the 5 elements, they never show her using 5 or 6 though, which I can only conclude, the elements of harmony were always on the pedestal in the Everfree Castle minus the 6th.
<AVeryStrange> Clouds not being "natural" by their definition does not imply pegasus ponies are unable to interact with/control them
<Nickbrony123> well hide then
<Benjamin> 0PROMOTIONS
<Darf14> In the future armor is completely useless
<combustiblelemons> Combustible lemons sends out CELESTIA!
<Nickbrony123> Living in the everfree forest wasn't going to be easy
<ivan2294> OP
<ivan2294> OP
<ivan2294> SHE IS OP
<rubenflonne> yes rip it out
<Arcesious> Getting my name specifically for a tripcode would take too long is what I'm saying
<combustiblelemons> CELESTIA used BANISH TO THE MOON
<Nightmare_Moon> Ergo, Celestia did not use all 6 to banish me. She only had the magic to banish me, not cleanse me
<RainBroDash> last game of today's Dreamhack SC2 matches is underway D: D:
<anoponymous> 0in the future heavy weaponry isnt used
<rubenflonne> let it bleed
<Benjamin> 0in the future, you don't need to aim.
<rubenflonne> best idea :D
<Rafasde> Very, but they IMPLY that they're different and something about not control on the show.
<Articuno> 12Did you get my text Nick? ovO
<prince-dari> Why pull it out?
<combustiblelemons> FLAWLESS VICTORY.
<prince-dari> O_o
<ivan2294> I USED NOT CARING ABOUT HER, SO I'M NOT BANISHED
<AVeryStrange> Nightmare_Moon: That's pretty much what I got from it as well, but right after the pedestal scene is the five as gems arranged with a sixth in the middle
<Benjamin> 0why not save the sarg?
<ivan2294> SCREW YOUR RULES I HAVE ACTUAL STRATEGIC THINKING
<RainBroDash> oh, dari, where you from dude?
<AVeryStrange> Rafasde: What?
<Misery> because he wanted to get shot
<RainBroDash> just random question :P
<Rarity0> Revolver: Rebels to GOD TOO? HERETICS!
<combustiblelemons> You lose accept it
<Nightmare_Moon> I assume to allude that there is a sixth
<Hipster_Brony> 8Looks like they got...
<Hipster_Brony> 8*puts on sunglasses*
<AVeryStrange> Hmm, that could be it
<Hipster_Brony> 8fired
<combustiblelemons> you're all in space.
<Silverscreen> 11HIPSTER: YEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
<prince-dari> I'm from the UK.
<RainBroDash> just die Hipster
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0YEEEEAAAAAH
<rubenflonne> noooooooo!!!!
<combustiblelemons> or the moon
<Misery> lol
<Rarity0> Revolver: REVOLVER used ULTRAMARE-INES!
<Nickbrony123> Find a stronger source of magic to fight her!!!!
<combustiblelemons> victory.
<Rafasde> Rainbow says something about Everfree weather
<Rarity0> brb
<Hipster_Brony> 8so much hate, rainbro
<RainBroDash> I thought so, someone said before. where abouts dude? I'm south, Berkshire
<ivan2294> Why would she banish her source of FOOD
<RainBroDash> <3
<AVeryStrange> It seems logical that there were only five at the time, since yeah, otherwise Celestia would have had the power to undo NM
<RainBroDash> (@Hipster)
<rubenflonne> best acting evar! :D
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Let go of your hate
<combustiblelemons> *sighs*
<prince-dari> I live near Reading.
<Nightmare_Moon> Also, I just noticed in the creation myth scene Celestia's hair turns blue the very scene after my banishment, I can only conclude that her role in raising both sun and moon gave her rainbow hair.
<ivan2294> And how does she know who to banish?
<combustiblelemons> nothing stops the other ponies from farming...
<Rafasde> Something about not controlling or other stuff, I can't remember right now
<Benjamin> 0Just shoot her already
<Hipster_Brony> 8DAT OVERACTING
<Benjamin> 0you had barely any screen time with her
<ivan2294> We hide amongst the civilians
<Arcesious> 15 times dropped...
<AVeryStrange> Nightmare_Moon: Oooh, that's a cool interpretation of it and a nice catch
<RainBroDash> ohoho, not far from me dude, I'm like one train stop from reading
<ivan2294> Is Celestia really that big a tyrant?
<SilverSonic> o-o
<combustiblelemons> She's a god
<anoponymous> 0<- bristol here
<combustiblelemons> You can't decieve a god
<Silverscreen> Maybe we should put Spider's web in our movie lineup.
<combustiblelemons> she sees all
<ivan2294> She is more of a god in the sense of Roman mythology
<RainBroDash> ohai anoponymous, didn't realise you were UK too :D
<anoponymous> 0yep :3
<AVeryStrange> Rafasde: I don't remember it being that they weren't controllable, rather, it was naturally occuring weather. I think we need to find the clip.
<ivan2294> Where they can die, and be tricked and all that
<Nightmare_Moon> Or if you're following fanfics, She ascended during her 1000year tenure
<RainBroDash> ^^
*Articuno spams Nick
<RainBroDash> eurobronies ftw
<Nickbrony123> Can see read minds or have foresight
<Arcesious> arc is sadface
<Hipster_Brony> isnt it already?
<Arcesious> he is american
<combustiblelemons> I still win.
<SilverSonic> lmao
<ivan2294> She is like a roman or greek god, SHE CAN DIE AND IS NOT PERFECT
<Rafasde> AVeryStarge: I'll watch the episode later to see that.
<RainBroDash> shame on you for where you were born :D
<Rafasde> *Strange
<Arcesious> :C
<AVeryStrange> I believe it was bridle gossip?
<ivan2294> She can't know who to banish
<Rafasde> Yes
<AVeryStrange> Great
<prince-dari> No ponies on the TV in UK yet though. :(
<Hipster_Brony> 8arcesious: http://cdn.wg.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/america-fuck-yeah.jpg

<anoponymous> 0and no merch
<RainBroDash> DARI, IN JULY
<Nickbrony123> and when she banished Luna she had to use the elements of Harmony didn't she
<RainBroDash> Cartoon Network
<RainBroDash> july
<RainBroDash> PONIES
<prince-dari> Then we take over the whole of the UK.
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0No ponies here in Sweden either. Don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, though.
<combustiblelemons> Earth ponies are banished to the moon, she sends all ponies on trains to be carefully examined
<ivan2294> Well, luna is harder to banish
<anoponymous> 0and no 90% of custom pony merch
<RainBroDash> I'm so excited
<NickBrony123> There is POnys in Canada
<combustiblelemons> one by one she banishes the few that hide
*Nick eats tins of spam
<ivan2294> That works so well in real life
<Misery> ponies on cartoon network?
<Nick> yeah arti
<Hipster_Brony> 8worst funeral speech ever
<Nick> replied to it :3
<Arcesious> blah im not very patriotic for an american sorry
<Misery> cool
<Nightmare_Moon> And I'm being dragged to dinner by supernatural forces, I'll rule your night later.
<RainBroDash> Ponies on cartoon network. In july.
<combustiblelemons> >inb4 ww2
<ivan2294> *sarcasm
<NickBrony123> and she waas my Fuck buddy
<anoponymous> 0 100 000 people died in 1 hour: nobody cares. One guy dies - throw a funeral
<RainBroDash> lolol
<ivan2294> That never works in real life
<combustiblelemons> Hitler wins with 6m casualties with that tactic
<Silverscreen> 11RainbroDash: You mean the'yll actually have something GOOD to watch on CN?
<Misery> that was also the only body they recovered lol
<Arcesious> i don't have cable.
<AVeryStrange> I like how in "The Sun is Tired" Celestia admits she only meant to lock her up for 1 year. That's headcanon for me.
<SirSprinkles> 6They didn't have the bodies for the others.
<Misery> cn hasnt been good in forever
<rubenflonne> regular show
<Arcesious> i use internet for everything.
<RainBroDash> Yes silver! for the first time in 9 years or so
<ivan2294> >implying he did kill all the jews
<Articuno> 12Ahh thanks!
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0One dead person is a tradegy. a million dead is statistics. Don't remember who said that.
<Articuno> 12Ok got it :>
<Benjamin> 0Stalin
<anoponymous> 0stalin
<Flamerunner> http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png
<Misery> ohboy
<Zebranky> Godwin
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0So that's who
<Misery> suddenly SS
<Arcesious> But going on CN should get MLP the ratings it rightfully deserves.
<NickBrony123> Quit Stalinin
<Darf14> She died for their sins
<Zebranky> Wait, are we comparing Celestia to Hitler?
<combustiblelemons> He didn't get a chance to finish his business
<Zebranky> That's awesome
<RainBroDash> well it will give MLP some fanbase in the UK at least
<ivan2294> Apprently
<Nickbrony123> DUnno
<Arcesious> though im scared we'll get a bunch of screaming 10-year olds trying to join our chan
<RainBroDash> just praying for more brony exposure
<SilverSonic> lol texting
<SilverSonic> i use msn more than text :b
<SilverSonic> :B*
<combustiblelemons> If left to it he probably would have done.
<Misery> wouldent that not be a good thing
<Misery> kinda
<Misery> like with what arcesious said
<combustiblelemons> What's stopping celestia?
<AMereLurker> Wasn't Hitler a no-no in daily?
<Benjamin> 0I prefer it to be private
<anoponymous> 0tbh all the fanbase we care about already got hooked up from the internet
<ivan2294> He would never have killed all the jews man
<combustiblelemons> yep im stopping that now.
<ivan2294> It's just not possible
<rubenflonne> there are already 15 people already *shrugs*
<anoponymous> 0i dunno why people care about television at all
<rubenflonne> 15 year olds**
<ivan2294> Same with celestia, you can't find EVERY SINGLE PERSON EVER
<Misery> i dont have a tv
<RainBroDash> Arc, the UK is a horribly place full of tryharding internet 'cool kids', so prepare for the most horrible few weeks of your life as ponies become 'cool' when it starts airing
<RainBroDash> calling it now
<ivan2294> Or in this case EARTH PONY
<anoponymous> 0same
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai Arti
<anoponymous> 0i have a tv cable but no TV lolz
<Arcesious> oh dear
<Misery> my god
<muffin_hooves> Back to P. Best unintentionally funny line of the movie.
<AVeryStrange> Okay, I blinked and missed this, what's this about Hitlestia?
<Rafasde> Commander Lemons, are we still at war? Over
<combustiblelemons> Slowly one by one they are drained in numbers
<Arcesious> just keep them out of /rp/
<anoponymous> 0so i dont even pay for tv licence
<Nickbrony123> So why r were killing Earth ponies?
<Arcesious> and i'll survive
<combustiblelemons> I think I've won rafa
<Misery> ponies being cool?
<combustiblelemons> Ivan declared war
<combustiblelemons> I win by banishing them to the moon.
<ivan2294> Its when you put your guard down that we will strike
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0Ponies are already cool
<prince-dari> I don't like to base how you treat someone or think of someone on their age.
<RainBroDash> cool, but in an uncool way
<Misery> to us yea
<ivan2294> You may banish me, but my brothers will carry on the task
<combustiblelemons> >with tiny numbers
<Benjamin> 0They could be and call me a hipster, I don't really want fags, faggin up mah pony.
<NickBrony123> They gots a bunch of noobs
<Misery> but i mean cool as in
<Misery> OH MY GOD IMMA WEAR PONIES BECAUSE I WANNA BE COOL
<anoponymous> 0ponies already suffer from getting into mainstream. (see fawx news)
<Rafasde> Sir, I think that something wrong going on with me... I'm starting to think like an... Earth Pony!
<Misery> kinda cool
<Misery> like that
<Nickbrony123> Cool
<combustiblelemons> *moon banishes rafa*
<Arcesious> i don't discriminate based on age.
<Bunnylisk> wow it certainly didn't take long for the hate to take over, did it?
<Flamerunner> Guys what you think? http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png
<ivan2294> Dude, Celestia can't just banish like that.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't need to text that often because I'm usually able to just talk to people online xD
<ivan2294> It take alot of power to do that anyways
<anoponymous> 0i wonder what took it so long
<combustiblelemons> I think she can.
<Arcesious> but i know from experience to expect the worst of anyone younger than 14
<Espeon> 06^
<prince-dari> [22:59] <Arcesious> though im scared we'll get a bunch of screaming 10-year olds trying to join our chan
<AVeryStrange> I wonder what the ratio is to RPing as Unicorn/Pegasus/Earth Pony.
<combustiblelemons> Alright then how about this
<Rafasde> It's cold in here Ivan.
<Espeon> 06but of course, everything has its use :p
<Arcesious> im not a hypocrite
<combustiblelemons> Celestia moon banishes you.
<ivan2294> You may think to highly of your tyrant queen lemons
<Benjamin> 0nah, its not hate, I just couldn't think of a better word, I just prefer it to be obscure.
<Arcesious> im speaking from experience
<ivan2294> I doubt she has the power
<combustiblelemons> >luna helps
<Nickbrony123> Flammerrunner how r u going to breath?
<muffin_hooves> Then mentor them in the way of ponies.
<AVeryStrange> Why would Luna want all these shmucks on her moon?
<prince-dari> While most 10-year olds on the internet are annoying, I've met several that were much more worthwhile to talk to than any of the other people claiming to be 16 and older (though I'm always sceptical).
<ivan2294> True dat
<Silverscreen> 11My consern is that we'll get a flood of 4chan-like kids into Ponychan that don't know the meaning of the words "nice", "Responsibility" or "Opinion"
<combustiblelemons> she needs company
<RainBroDash> unfortunately, 10 year olds do have a high capability to follow crowds. and one quite popular crowd in the uk is the 'cool internet kids' who chill out on Reddit making rageface memes
<rubenflonne> mentor them to me more intelligent
<Flamerunner> see the black curve thing in the helmet?
<RainBroDash> they will maybe get into ponies.
<Flamerunner> if you look me in the back they're open
<NickBrony123> OMFG r pony getting moar cancerous
<ivan2294> She's already back on earth/equestria
<Bunnylisk> Everypony is welcome. Everypony is loved. Our sites have moderators to take care of bad behavior.
<combustiblelemons> also now they'll respect her darned moon.
<Arcesious> I know a few younger bronies who are fine as well, yes.
<AVeryStrange> Just like people "respect" Alcatraz?
<ivan2294> She can teleport us back
<combustiblelemons> have you seen her all this season?
<Misery> none of my friends even like ponies :(
<ivan2294> Plus I still think you don't have the power, but if celestia does then why not luna?
<Nickbrony123> but ponies brath from the front of there face dont they?
<combustiblelemons> If she wanted to... what's saying shes on your side?
<Misery> they think im some sort of manchild for watching the show h
<Rafasde> But Luna is not in the moon...
<Nickbrony123> *breath
<Arcesious> I never stepped foot on reddit.
<AVeryStrange> combustiblelemons: She's been alone for 1000 years. She went to the royal "companionship" chamber and Celestia can't get her out.
<ivan2294> Banishment for a 1000 years
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0I expected to see more bugs in this movie.
<Arcesious> *hipsterface*
<animefan222> only my extremely annoying friend likes ponies
<Benjamin> 0I agree with RBD
<ivan2294> That's what
<ivan2294> And you are ignoring the issue
<Rafasde> STOP THINKING LIKE AN EARTH PONY, YOU FOAL. Soryy. Had to do that.
<Rafasde> *Sorry
<SheenaFox> But you have no use
<SheenaFox> jkjk
<ivan2294> How do you know that Celestia CAN banish us all
<Espeon> 06D:
<anoponymous> 0i dont have a facebook account, beat that :P
<Espeon> 06<3
<prince-dari> Those kinds of people would generally dismiss things like MLP as being 'beneath' them.
<Nickbrony123> Special beam Cannon!!!!! * destory the Moon*
<ivan2294> I don't even know our exact nubmers
<Misery> me neither
<Arcesious> From my experience most kids seem to start to mellow out and mature at about 16-17
<anoponymous> 0*hipsterglasses on*
<combustiblelemons> Friendship
<ivan2294> *numbers
<Silverscreen> 11Misery: You say that like it's a bad thing.
<SheenaFox> !Espeon
<Rafasde> Celestia is a Sun Goddess... of course she cans!
*Espeon now belongs to SheenaFox for 5 minutes
<rubenflonne> change your color back prince x3
<Arcesious> 14-15 they're usually okay too
<combustiblelemons> ^my point exactly
<Benjamin> 0atleast we might be able to say "I like ponies before they were cool and sold out"
<Silverscreen> 11There's nothing wrong with keeping your inner child.
<Misery> i suppose it isnt a bad thing lol
<prince-dari> I don't have facebook, though I'm getting it because it make it easier to stay in touch with people who I'd otherwise lose contact with.
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari is a mod, he aint gotta explain shit
<Rafasde> I'm learning, Commander.
<ivan2294> She needed teh elements to help her banish ONE PONY
<combustiblelemons> If she can move the sun she can teleport ponies to the moon.
<Rafasde> She needed the Elements to banish ONE GODDESS OF THE MOON.
<Silverscreen> 11I don't give a damn if I'm 35 and in a bar, if Lion King starts playing on a TV, I'll sit there and watch it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8good idea dari, thats the best way to use it
<anoponymous> 0white background is a little annoying tho
<Bunnylisk> I fail to see how the show being more popular is bad. It means more income for the creators and more seasons for us to watch
<AVeryStrange> Celestia's either a gambler or has some sort of omniscience given that she was banking on Twilight (read: introverted nerd) going and making exactly 5 friends in a 12 hour period.
<combustiblelemons> Goddess provides resistance.
<Hipster_Brony> 8dealwithit.jpg
<Nickbrony123> There ... no moon for her to banish anypony to
<anoponymous> 0ofc, cos lion kind is awesome
<AVeryStrange> (Okay wait it was closer to 24 but still)
<ivan2294> And you honestly think she can banish millions upon millions of ponies?
<Misery> i think its more of the idea of the fanbase being polluted
<Misery> sorta
<Arcesious> I'm not saying that staying in touch with your inner child is bad
<ivan2294> Without even know where they are?
<combustiblelemons> eeeeeyup
<combustiblelemons> one by one bro
<ivan2294> Don't you need a specific target for magic to work?
<Benjamin> 0its not so much it being popular, more fear for the chan for me anyway.
<Flamerunner> what are you guys talkin' about
<Rafasde> Ivan, she can RAISE THE FRIGGIN' SUN. Of course!
<SilverSonic> !sheenafox
*SilverSonic flees
<combustiblelemons> how hard can it be just find all no winged no horned pony there
<Hipster_Brony> 8the day we start excluding people from our fanbase is the day we stop becoming special
<rubenflonne> i like what i like, i don't care if its main stream or not
<ivan2294> VERY HARD
<Silverscreen> 11The problem isn't that it'll be popular. The problem is that the fandom may attract the wrong kind of people.
<Rafasde> Raise the Sun OOOOOR move the Earth. You choose.
<ivan2294> We are scattered EVERYWHERE
<combustiblelemons> Tests will be carried out
<ivan2294> And we aren't just Earth Ponies only
<Arcesious> exactly, like silverscreen said
<rubenflonne> i thought MLP was MS bullshit till i sat down and watched the first episode out of curiousity
<prince-dari> I don't see why it matters though.
<Silverscreen> 11Not that we'll purposely exclude anypony.
<combustiblelemons> *sighs*
<ivan2294> That's just our main rank
<combustiblelemons> You are just earth ponies.
<prince-dari> You get annoying people in every fandom.
<AVeryStrange> Problem is she needs the elements of harmony, doesn't she? Aren't two of those held by earth ponies?
<Misery> i never saw mlp as a show for little girls i just think its a great cartoon
<ivan2294> We have a few, only a few, rebels from other races
<combustiblelemons> Celestia controls the rest.
<Nickbrony123> True true
<Barry> not to cut in, but Dari has a point.
<Bunnylisk> I'm not worried about the chan. The mods over there are great. Honestly I think there's a lot more diversity in this little fandom than we might think. There's nothing wrong with adding more
<Darf14> I just hope we don't labeled very badly
<ivan2294> Controls?
<Arcesious> Fimchan and /co/ seem to take care of most of the less preferrable kinds of bronies at least
<Nickbrony123> but the elements are incomplete
<combustiblelemons> yep
<Silverscreen> 11But like I said, I don't want any 4chan douchebags coming in and being all "I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG MY PONIES ARE BETTER AND YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST, 'CAUSE THEN I'LL TROLL YOU, RAAAAAAAAAAGH!"
<combustiblelemons> mind control
<RainBroDash> Barry this is an open discussion, please feel free to get stuck in :P
<ivan2294> As in mind-control?
<ivan2294> Prove it
<anoponymous> 0i first discovered MLP when watched g4, so i had no bias at all
<combustiblelemons> how else does she enable harmony across the land
<Nickbrony123> you still need to and I destoryed the moon
<Arcesious> 16 times dropped from the broadcast, lul.
<AVeryStrange> Benevolence and wisdom?
<RainBroDash> @Silver, i hate that whole 'LOL IM TROLING AND THE INTERNET CANT STOP ME CUS IM TROLLING LOL'
<Barry> I first discovered it online
<ivan2294> Well for one thing WE ARE F*CKING REBELLING
<combustiblelemons> when behaviours such as stealing are seen in the show
<Barry> My first episode was Pinkie Keen, in fact
<Hipster_Brony> 8who cares what we get labeled as?
<combustiblelemons> erego you can't uprise
<prince-dari> ^
<combustiblelemons> you are all celestia's mindslaves ^_^
<Silverscreen> 11I don't care for the hugbox label
<AVeryStrange> I don't think that's logically sound
<AVeryStrange> At all
<Bunnylisk> Personally, I think if we get hung up on who the "real" fans are we're going to just destroy the community with drama
<AVeryStrange> ._.
<prince-dari> People you don't know or care about label you. notasinglefuck.jpg
<Barry> let whoever is into ponies join, I say
<ivan2294> inb4 Bitch ponies from Call of Cutie
<Arcesious> I don't mind the hugbox thing
<RainBroDash> The worse we get labelled, the less likely my friends will consent to try and accept the show and watch it with me :/
<Arcesious> i give everyone hugs
<B-Man> Here's to 20 million page views before Season 2
<B-Man> >_>
<Barry> regardless of what generation they started in
<combustiblelemons> ikr
<ivan2294> YEAH
*Espeon yawn
<ivan2294> 20 MIL
<combustiblelemons> 20m is too easy
<Rafasde> Lemons, why Celestia would be on our side?
<ivan2294> Okay, back to war
<Hipster_Brony> 8exactly, dari
<anoponymous> 0one of reasons i started watching MLP is because if of how badly labeled it was on MLP
<RainBroDash> they're really concerned about what everyone thinks, I'm only really concerned about what they think tbh :P
*Angel_Espeon 13also yawns
<combustiblelemons> 50m is a challenge
<rubenflonne> i don't care about labeling or what people think of me, im me thats all
<Angel_Espeon> 13;;
<anoponymous> 0just to piss people off
<BlankFlankBrony> Indeed.
<Sathi> Evening how is the lag tonight?
<combustiblelemons> because she's a pegasi?
<MFW> proceed on mission
<Silverscreen> 11It's when people start getting derogatory about it like calling all of us coltcuddlers and crap like that.
<Rafasde> No... she's an Alicorn
<ivan2294> She is an Alicorn
<RainBroDash> yeye^
<Hipster_Brony> 8sathi: about the same
<combustiblelemons> and its her job to make harmony across the lands?
<NickBrony123> the show is good, that why you are a fan
<Misery> yea
<combustiblelemons> so she has to stop war
<ivan2294> And pegasi are puppets to the unicorn
<Sathi> aww any idea what's causing it?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<combustiblelemons> so she must win
<rubenflonne> sadistic fun time here :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8its because its blu-ray quality
<Silverscreen> 11Sathi: It's because of the vid's quality
<Bunnylisk> Love and tolerate the shit out of them, then
<prince-dari> Silverscreen: I couldn't care less that they think that though.
<Espeon> 06Yay :3
<Rafasde> Ivan, sorry but Pegasi are not.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and we think sprinkles might have a bandwidth cap
<ivan2294> Who's to say she just won't kill both our races and leave the Unicorn?
<Sathi> Ah I see
<muffin_hooves> It does have lag, but I'm not sure anyone is watching it anyway.
<ivan2294> After all if she wants harmony, just get rid of both problems no?
<Hipster_Brony> 8SECRET BRAIN FUN
<combustiblelemons> we're too awesome to be culled
<combustiblelemons> who says she'll kill us all
<ivan2294> Unicorns aren't doing anything
<AVeryStrange> Seems to me that if you want a race to be your "puppets", you don't give them strategic race-only bases that would require significant magics to even attempt infiltration
<Arcesious> i don't care what people think of me...
<ivan2294> Who says she'll kill US all?
<combustiblelemons> earth and pegasi
<Angel_Espeon> 13Since I have nothing better to do, I'm gonna find a looooong quiz to do on dA to entertain me for a while |D
<NickBrony123> NOmNOMNOMONOMONOMNOMONMONOM
<combustiblelemons> why would she kill them both.
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't think it's a bandwidth cap.
<anoponymous> 0*siiiiip*
<SirSprinkles> 6Because the lagging is on my end.
<Benjamin> 0Delicious brain, you must drink it.
<ivan2294> Why not? She needs harmony and we are both fighting
<Espeon> 06Good luck :P
<Rafasde> Who says that Celestia will have only one side at the battlefield?
<muffin_hooves> BRAINBUG WINS FATALITY
<Rafasde> *help
<Articuno> 12DA has quizzes?
<combustiblelemons> ^its hr job to make harmony in equestria
<B-Man> So I wonder how long it'll be before we hit 1 billion pageviews. :3
<Benjamin> 0The Knife was ultimatly effective.
<SirSprinkles> 6THE WINGEST BONER
<Rafasde> She'll be neutral, or kill EVERY FIGHTING PONY, in my opinion.
<combustiblelemons> a long time b- man
<NickBrony123> LOL so true about the knife
<ivan2294> EXACTLY
<DJMidli> BOLD AND CAPSLOCK: NO
<Darf14> Wait...They have a plan?! Does not compute!*brain implodes*
<combustiblelemons> She has to do something
<Angel_Espeon> 13Journal quizzes :3
<Arcesious> I already know I'm rather eccentric anyhow.
<AVeryStrange> Orders of magnitude dude
<rubenflonne> xD
<ivan2294> Even if you COULD get rid of us, she would only set her sights on you
<Angel_Espeon> 13My journal is filled with them LOL
<Rafasde> Sorry DJ.
<Benjamin> 0plans? Thats not how humans do things!
<Articuno> 12Oh those!
<combustiblelemons> why?
<B-Man> We're like 1.2% there already. :P
<Articuno> 12I haven't done one in ages!
<Sathi> ah yes the lag beast is back
<combustiblelemons> you're uprising
<NickBrony123> Hip fire FTW!!!
<Nick> I finally did it
<Hipster_Brony> 8JOHN RICO: SAVER OF HUMENS
<Articuno> 12I'm gonna start a thread on TST for that >3
<ivan2294> True, but you are also fighting
<combustiblelemons> we're defending her
<rubenflonne> spray and pray
<Silverscreen> 11where sound go?
<anoponymous> 0aiming is for sissies
<Nick> I met giovanni in SS :)
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well I just found one that's "202 things about yourself" LOL
<Articuno> 12(jk) But if anyone wants to, go for it ovO
<combustiblelemons> therefore she takes our side.
<Barry> It seems that scenes of high actions are also full of lag
<AVeryStrange> It's after all this that the seaponies rise to power, right?
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Articuno> 12LOL!
<ivan2294> Who's to say she won't see you as a threat later?
<Barry> action*
<Articuno> 12Link, Angel?
<Articuno> 12Pls?
<Rafasde> Wait... the Earth ponies are attacking Celestia?
<Hipster_Brony> 8not detective carter!
<anoponymous> 0inner censorship
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't even read what the questions, I just picked the longest one I could find |D
<Silverscreen> 11I just realized....all that stupid shit with the ferret at the beginning of the movie...that was a wasted subplot/Deus ex machima.
<combustiblelemons> ...because we defended her....?
<Rafasde> And the Pegasi are defending?
<Sathi> yea same as last night
<combustiblelemons> eeyup
<Articuno> 12Nick ffs I havent finished the game yet
<Articuno> 12SPOILERS
<ivan2294> look at the government, it is DOMINATED by Unicorns.
<SirSprinkles> 6AND THEN BLACK GUY DIED
<Angel_Espeon> 13http://quizzes.deviantart.com/art/2-202-things-about-yourself-15472843
<Arcesious> yay lag
<B-Man> I just had an idea...
<Sathi> hahaha you sure?
<Arcesious> i give lag hugs.
<combustiblelemons> ^ivan loses
<ivan2294> First us, then the Pegasi
<Rafasde> Oh... so of course she'll help the defending side!
<combustiblelemons> in every way his uprising is flawed
<Arcesious> so it will go away.
<Darf14> Dam he had only 2 days until retirement
<B-Man> What if Hasbro had a contest in which your OC pony gets animated into an episode?
<Silverscreen> 11Darf14: You win an internet.
<Rafasde> The Royal Guard is dominated by Pegasu, by the wat.
<B-Man> Woe?
<Nickbrony123> as a background pony.....
<ivan2294> Every way >implying that you beat me when it was just supplies
<Rafasde> *way
<combustiblelemons> I'm not a fan of OC B-man
<AVeryStrange> ivan2294: I see that as a function of the unicorn tendency to intellectual pursuits, which always lends itself to aristrocracy through wealth and public position
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver: its almost like parts of this movie are unnecessary
<Rafasde> *pegasi
<Nick> yes but you don't have celebi either >
<NickBrony123> I lol'd
<B-Man> *Wouldn't that be awesome
<Nick> >>*
<AVeryStrange> So really the race division is a byproduct
*Nick runs!
<Benjamin> 0add another genocide to humanities honours.
<Espeon> 06tempting
<B-Man> That'd make the pony semi-canon
<Angel_Espeon> 13do eet
<Barry> I keep hearing and reading about "an internet". What is "an internet"
<Angel_Espeon> 13:P
<ivan2294> I have no problem with the Pegasi, only the opresssing Unicorns
<combustiblelemons> I'm not going to argue any more, I;ve won.
<Nick> ok now I have celebi
<ivan2294> >impling you won
<Rafasde> Unicorns aren't oprissing
<NickBrony123> OK everybody time to take another planet
<AVeryStrange> Won what?
<prince-dari> It's just something people say.
<Rafasde> *opressing
<Nick> does anyone have a Kyogre frome HG to trade?
<Barry> ah
<Benjamin> 0Damn it! Bart lived!
<combustiblelemons> Meh I don't see a problem with unicorns
<Darf14> its another meme that everyone use
<anoponymous> 0it looks dirty
<ivan2294> Besides, you only one because of your stupid OP Celestia
<Misery> ITS AFRAIDDDDDDDDD
<combustiblelemons> >mayor mare is an earth pony.
<anoponymous> 0too suggestive
<Hipster_Brony> 8ITS AFRAIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<ivan2294> I just wanted a regular war
<prince-dari> So this is where the weasel thing comes in.
<ivan2294> But you just HAD to pull the over-powered card on me
<Benjamin> 0FEAR US
<NickBrony123> Holy shit it AFRAID!!!!!!
<AVeryStrange> :\ I can't tell if all y'all are having as much fun as me or actually fighting here.
<ivan2294> nah, this is fun
<combustiblelemons> sorry there avery
<anoponymous> 0did she get impaled?
<Misery> she doesnt notice the whole in her shoulder anymore
<Misery> hole*
<ivan2294> Although it was more fun when we were on equal footing
<NickBrony123> why did they just fucking nuke the place?
<combustiblelemons> *yawn*
<Rafasde> Yep, that's pretty fun.
<AVeryStrange> Okay. Just so long as it's all good natured ^_^
<SirSprinkles> 6Look! It's drill sargeant!
<muffin_hooves> You beat them by nuking them from orbit.
<Benjamin> 0The adrenaline rush takes away the pain
<NickBrony123> or artillay fire or something like that?
<combustiblelemons> heh don't worry it's almost over now
<AVeryStrange> And now I leave. (P.S. Viva la Luna rebellion)
<Rafasde> But I think that we're having a draw here, Commander Lemons
<NickBrony123> Penetraned
<NooPony> Oh wow. I just ate a chip that had a perfectly round circular hole in it
<combustiblelemons> I think we have a flawless victory
<ivan2294> The only trump card you have is Celestia, you must be pretty desperate to pull that one
<DragonRage> CENSORED
<Barry> The adrenaline rush is coupled by the most powerful pain killer in the world
<Misery> >defeat one brainbug on one of the many bug controlled planets
<Articuno> 12Looks awesome, I will start this at some point XD
<Misery> >win war
<Darf14> The censor bar! IT DOES NOTHING!
<combustiblelemons> nope.
<ivan2294> Then prove it
<Benjamin> 0and we will break your hand!
<Rafasde> Ivan, why are the Earth Ponies attacking the Princess, anyway?
<combustiblelemons> As I explained you'd slowly die one by one in the forest
<rubenflonne> no your arm not your hand xD
<MFW> wait wat
<ivan2294> Not all earth ponies
<NickBrony123> for three more movies
<combustiblelemons> and as I explained you'd slowly die in the desert
<ivan2294> Just most
<MFW> confusing ending
<Benjamin> 0The ending
<Benjamin> 0it means nothing!
<combustiblelemons> there we go.
<ivan2294> As I explained we have a supply system and orchards
<Rafasde> Why are most of the Earth Ponies attacking?
<Arcesious> well... that movie was okay.
<ivan2294> OPRESSION FROM UNICORNS
<Arcesious> not great though.
<Benjamin> 0Its so shitty
<combustiblelemons> which run out and need water....
<anoponymous> 0notice THEY'LL win, not WE'LL win
<DragonRage> Man, this movie just confuses me.
<anoponymous> 0the irony
<rubenflonne> propaganda war film
<Sathi> hehe it's a b movie for a reason
<prince-dari> I love this movie. XD
<ivan2294> Supply SYSTEM
<muffin_hooves> So bad it's fun.
<combustiblelemons> which we have in the skies bro.
<MFW> oh gosh
<Rafasde> Unicorns aren't opressing...
<MFW> oh gosh
<Darf14> Its a good B movie in my book
<anoponymous> 0yay
<Silverscreen> 11yay
<DragonRage> WOO!
<NickBrony123> it made me laugh though out the time
<Arcesious> YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
<ivan2294> Also, Deserts still have water
<NickBrony123> ....yay....
<Rafasde> BTW, Celestia is an Alicorn. Not an Unicorn.
<Arcesious> i love this song!!!!!!
<ivan2294> That's just propaganda Rafasde
<Darf14> *Inhaled deeply*.....yay
<anoponymous> 0yay yay yay
<Benjamin> 0yay~
<Hipster_Brony> 8I I I I DONT DONT DONT DONT
<combustiblelemons> which will run out...
<ivan2294> But she leads the unicorns
<anoponymous> 0*volume up*
<prince-dari> LOL anyone else got video/audio desync?
<Mongoose> Yo
<Silverscreen> 11ahhhhhh!
<ivan2294> Water doesn't run out
<Arcesious> max volume
<Rafasde> ...no, she leads all races....
<Silverscreen> 11~*
<combustiblelemons> it does.
<Silverscreen> 11ahhhhhhhhhh~
<ivan2294> And underground lakes are HUGE
<prince-dari> Arcesious: I'll join you.
<combustiblelemons> >and run out.
<Arcesious> well be careful
<ivan2294> Eventually, but then the rain happens
<muffin_hooves> Now that's a cheer.
<Arcesious> don't let it go over 12 decibels
<ivan2294> Plus we also have the everfree
<combustiblelemons> *pegasi control the skies.
<combustiblelemons> over the desert.
<combustiblelemons> No clouds get through
<ivan2294> There are no clouds in the desert, true...
<combustiblelemons> no rain.
<prince-dari> My dad's probably wondering what the hell I'm doing. XD
<ivan2294> We still have the everfree to provide water
<combustiblelemons> desert earth ponies die.
<Rafasde> Lemons = Pegasi both control AND generate new clouds.
<Arcesious> lulz
<combustiblelemons> exactly
<Rafasde> Stupid =
<Silverscreen> 11Tell him it's a special porno
<Rafasde> *:
<Arcesious> why, ponies of course!
<combustiblelemons> D:
<ivan2294> And we still have rebel bases and outposts hidden across equestria
<anoponymous> 0i still dont get the title though
<Nickbrony123> What about the natrual clouds?
<ivan2294> And we have a supply network
<prince-dari> Because it's based on a song called "Avast your ass".
<Arcesious> it's based off of a song
<rubenflonne> alright, i have a few more slots open for the D&D MLP campaign who wants to join
<ivan2294> That's only in the everfree Nick
<combustiblelemons> Pegasi controls all weather
<RainBroDash> yay~
<Silverscreen> 11anoponymous: it's a parody of a song called Avast Your Ass
<anoponymous> 0ah
<anoponymous> 0i see
<SirSprinkles> 6It's slightly desynced because of the fact that I have to run sound through VAC, dari.
<combustiblelemons> except over the everfree forest
<anoponymous> 0need to check it out
<Arcesious> such an amazing parody
<prince-dari> My dad said he'd watch an episode of MLP sometime.
<Arcesious> it could cure cancer
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, awesome
<Arcesious> Episode 4
<combustiblelemons> so if we only water in designated areas where you aren't you die
<RainBroDash> niiice dari :D
<Arcesious> best choice
<prince-dari> SirSprinkles: Why bother running it through VAC?
<Arcesious> for someone new.
<ivan2294> You don't know where we are, aside from the desert
<combustiblelemons> if you go into the everfree forest you have to constantly defend from monsters
<Nick> btw arti about things to do in Newcastle, have you heard of the life museum?
<B-Man> And then I posted my idea for an OC pony to be animated into the show on the MLP FB page.
<Nick> http://www.life.org.uk/
<SirSprinkles> 6Because otherwise you'd hear everything that goes into my mic. And I'm in a cafe.
<ivan2294> This is a guerilla war, we are EVERYWHERE
<BlankFlankBrony> Okay, quick question from one who hasn't been paying much attention...
<Hipster_Brony> 8best episode to convert imo is fall weather friends
<prince-dari> Oh, I don't have mics plugged in/turned on unless I'm using them.
<combustiblelemons> please just surrender
<Nick> I've been there lots of times now and its really cool, they have a 3D motion ride and upstairs games room thing
<Nickbrony123> Earth pony should go to the Everfree forest to make a base
<ivan2294> NEVAH
<BlankFlankBrony> ...what they hay started this war?
<Articuno> 12Yes we walked past it
<Nick> but the entry fee is pricey :\
<combustiblelemons> ask ivan.
<Articuno> 12ovo
<muffin_hooves> Hey, my cancer's gone.
<Articuno> 12How pricey?
<SirSprinkles> 6I am using mine.
<ivan2294> I ACCUSE THE UNICORNS OF OPRESSING OTHER RACES
<Arcesious> Which one was fall weather friends again?
<ivan2294> And the pegasi are helping them
<prince-dari> Ah.
<Arcesious> what was the plot?
<Barry> episode 13
<Nick> well I remember it going in 18 it was nine pounds
<Hipster_Brony> 8the one with the race
<Rafasde> Commander Lemons, I require permision to retire.
<Arcesious> oh
<RainBroDash> oh yeah. question time. Best episode to convert someone who would probably be skeptical and timid about watching MLP?
<BlankFlankBrony> And your proof is...?
<prince-dari> IRON PONY!
<Articuno> 12WHAT!!!
<Arcesious> i remember now
<combustiblelemons> Permission granted
<Articuno> 12No way, sorry
<combustiblelemons> you've fought well rafa
<ivan2294> Government is full of Unicorns
<Arcesious> well if you ask me episode 4 is better
<Misery> dragonshy or the one with trixie
<Articuno> 12The younger lot arent gonna be able to afford that I'm sure
<Rafasde> Thank you. Good luck and farewell.
<combustiblelemons> *RD salutes
<ivan2294> While we all work for them
<Arcesious> for conversion.
<Articuno> 12That really sucks >v>
<Rafasde> *salutes back
<Nick> yeah 9.95 now...
<MonsieurLeFlour> 0I've converted with the pilot, Bridle Gossip and Swarm of the Century.
<Articuno> 12-v-v-v-
<Silverscreen> 11PINGAS!
<combustiblelemons> *big boss smusic plays*
<Arcesious> Luna: DReam mode?
<Misery> i love this one
<NickBrony123> Twilight OBama
<prince-dari> I see a lot of people say Party Of One.
<Arcesious> okay then
<rubenflonne> so sprinkles you going to try to fix your sound or what, x3
<NickBrony123> AMMMMMMMMMMMMREIA FUCKYEAH
<Pusai> I'd go for Bridle Gossip
<NickBrony123> lol fail
<Nick> I've been there too many times too to warrant that price I'm afriad
<Misery> >slavery >dogs putting collar on rarity
<ivan2294> You do know how guerilla wars work right?
<combustiblelemons> yep
<combustiblelemons> i starve you out of existance
<MFW> lol amereia
<ivan2294> That doesn't work
<Hipster_Brony> 8party of one seems kind of girly to me though
<ivan2294> Not in Guerilla wars
<combustiblelemons> we survive in pegasi only or unicorn only areas
<Nick> y'know I only realise aside from shops and bars there really isn't much to do in Newcastle
<Nickbrony123> Tahts why you go to the everfree forest
<Misery> thats why they should watch dragonshy
<FeelsBadPony> So I come home from work today
<Hipster_Brony> 8fall weather friends reminds me of old cartoons
<Misery> dragons are totally alpha and stuff
<RainBroDash> hmmm
<FeelsBadPony> and my rarity brushable is nowhere to be found
<Silverscreen> 11I prefer Winter Wrap Up for conversion.
<Hipster_Brony> 8NFL
<combustiblelemons> where they get mauled by ursa majors
<FeelsBadPony> turns out my mom threw it away
<BlankFlankBrony> Awwwww....
<BlankFlankBrony> WHAT.
<FeelsBadPony> :(
<ivan2294> They can't kill us all
<combustiblelemons> what can earth ponies do about ursa majors
<ivan2294> And some of us are good with animals
<combustiblelemons> Nothing.
<Misery> >zecore >immigrants
<Silverscreen> 11porno = Rarity XD
<RarityFeelsSorry> I wonder why you can't find your Rarity brushable
<RarityFeelsSorry> Hmmmm
<ivan2294> Fluttershy is NOT the only pony good with animals you know
*RarityFeelsSorry burns it
<FeelsBadPony> D:
<combustiblelemons> Fluttershy is the god of animals.
<ivan2294> And we live everywhere
<rubenflonne> hey twottle you there?
<combustiblelemons> she is also a pegasi
<Silverscreen> 11:D
<Arcesious> I have this one too
<anoponymous> 0ah, love this one
<FluttershyIsNervous> No, no I'm not...
<Misery> i dont even like the song in this one but the video was so well made
<SirSprinkles> 6This is by far my favorite PMV
<combustiblelemons> she sets all animals against you
<combustiblelemons> :D
<ivan2294> There you go, pull stuff out of your a$$
<Nickbrony123> Not with the animals at Celetia's palace
<anoponymous> 0classic, never gets old
<Arcesious> Apart, the songs are all horrible...
<combustiblelemons> lol
<ivan2294> Please I just want a normal fight
<Arcesious> together... amazing.
<anoponymous> 0true
<BlankFlankBrony> You just want to fight, period.
<ivan2294> I enjoy strategy and tactics
<combustiblelemons> Just saying ive won this
<Nickbrony123> BUt what about Love and Tolerence?
<Nick> perhaps we could do the hancock again? since it'll not be sunday we'd have more time
<Nickbrony123> :(
<combustiblelemons> >all stuff is grown in CLOUDS
<Silverscreen> 11This is a good vid. The editing is spot on.
<ivan2294> You do win with celestia, but I want to see how far I can get
<Nick> also there's the baltic art gallery like I said before
<Arcesious> wait till the RBD parts
<combustiblelemons> CLOUD cities are watered
<Larscis> Fairway Bunker has no need for love -or- tolerance!
<FluttershyIsNervous> What do you think I'm made of?
<combustiblelemons> NOWHERE ELSE IS
<ivan2294> We live everywhere
<ivan2294> EVERY
<ivan2294> WHERE
<Arcesious> they're hilarious.
<RainBroDash> this vid i agree is epic, but I dislike the songs :P
<ivan2294> You don't know where to water
<combustiblelemons> earth ponies cant stand on clouds
<Misery> yup
<combustiblelemons> bye
<ivan2294> And where to not
<Silverscreen> 11Goes to prove: Ponies makes everything better.
<ivan2294> Also, you work for the unicorns remember?
<combustiblelemons> if i only water a cloud which earth ponies cant get to
<combustiblelemons> then what?
<Darf14> agreed
<anoponymous> 0ayep
<combustiblelemons> >twilight could make them stand on clouds
<SirSprinkles> 6The songs picked for the individual ponies are just perfect.
<combustiblelemons> I think all unicorns could do the same
<ivan2294> Twilight isn't that powerful
<Flamerunner> SPOILER: [secretmessage]That portal Chell shot onto the moon is what let Nightmare Moon out.[/secretmessage]
<ivan2294> And not all unicorns are as powerful
<prince-dari> Pinkie's section there was just too good.
<combustiblelemons> lol flame
<NooPony> Heh, Flame
<Nickbrony123> they can only use the magic to help with there speical talent
<combustiblelemons> they help each other out?
<ivan2294> Also, you are assuming that Celestia is will to starve innocents
<ivan2294> *willing
<combustiblelemons> Remember twilight helped the rest out
<ivan2294> She isn't that powerfull
<combustiblelemons> all earth ponies are fighting right?
<ivan2294> Millions of unicorn live all over the place
<ivan2294> Not all
<Arcesious> Luna: Dream Mode next?
<combustiblelemons> those that surrender we will allow back
<ivan2294> ITS A GUERILLA WAR
<Arcesious> pwease?
<combustiblelemons> those that surrender we allow back
<combustiblelemons> under containment in POW camps.
<ivan2294> Would celestia really approve of that? I think not
<Flamerunner> Equestria is Earth in 30XX
<combustiblelemons> I think so
<Nickbrony123> how would you stop the unicorns from using magic?
<ivan2294> That doesn't sound like harmony AT ALL
<Articuno> 12I think I have some plans
<SirSprinkles> 6It's in the list.
<Flamerunner> and 30XX is the year Portal 2 takes place
<Flamerunner> ergo
<combustiblelemons> Violent ponies dead = harmony
<MFW> ...
<Nick> tell plz?
<Flamerunner> Portal 2 takes place in Ex-Earth
<Nick> :3
<Arcesious> awesomes
<Flamerunner> Equestria
<Misery> called it
<Misery> i had it in my mind this would be the next one
<Arcesious> wait i don't have this one
<Arcesious> link please?
<B-Man> BBL
<Cynder7> 6That image is creepy.. o.o
<ivan2294> That's what makes this war difficult for you to win, you are ASSUMING Celestia would just stop supplying her people
<Cynder7> 6Along with ze music.. D:
<Misery> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1FE7yHGcAw&NR=1
<Articuno> 12Art gallery is one, so thanks :> the others are anime stores, the shopping center, bowling alley for arcade games and lunch of course. But for the next day Im not sure
<ivan2294> And move everyone onto clouds
<combustiblelemons> ...
<combustiblelemons> Bro, you're uprising
<combustiblelemons> I win
<ivan2294> Where it will be overcrowded with terrible conditions
<Arcesious> oh my god
<combustiblelemons> besides i'm the tactician
<Arcesious> this playing twice at once
<Arcesious> it's really cool.
<Misery> lol
<combustiblelemons> it's pretty easy to expand cloud cities
<ivan2294> Exactly, you don't choose what celestia does

<ivan2294> I got what I wanted
<combustiblelemons> MUST BE DONE FLAME
<Cynder7> 6Shneeeeeeeeeeee
<SirSprinkles> 6Weird Al apparently commented about this video and said he liked it.
<combustiblelemons> whats that ivan?
<ivan2294> And that was to make you so desperate as to pull out Celestia again
<combustiblelemons> ...
<RainBroDash> he posted it on twitter i think :P
<Darf14> Someone drew a pony version of Weird Al
<CogWeaver> I have returned
<ivan2294> I beat you until you HAD to use Celestia
<CogWeaver> sup lemons
<Flamerunner> besides i need a cover for the fan fic i'm writing
<Misery> weird al confirmed for brony
<combustiblelemons> hi cog
<ivan2294> So good enough for me
<ivan2294> ^_^
<Icy> 12Sir, I do not want this
<prince-dari> Yeah, but that doesn't make him a brony.
<combustiblelemons> not really
<RainBroDash> idd :P
<ivan2294> Right....
<combustiblelemons> why would they defect ivan
<combustiblelemons> give me one good reason.
<SirSprinkles> 6He will be assimilated.
<Cynder7> 6Why not dear sir?
<Silverscreen> 11Feel Good, inc. :D
<ivan2294> Because some will realize their opression
<Misery> i wish this part was longer
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> i liek the idea of ghost recon ponies!
<Flamerunner> http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png :D
<ivan2294> Not all are as cruel as you
<combustiblelemons> BUT THEY'RE IN POWER
<combustiblelemons> D:
<ivan2294> Not all are as CRUEL AS YOU
<Icy> 12It's not space
<ivan2294> Also, pegasi are not in pwoer
<prince-dari> Gyro Bowl > Space
<ivan2294> So they have even more reason
<combustiblelemons> yep they are
<Cynder7> 6SPACEUS FTW
<ivan2294> no, government is dominated by Unicorns
<combustiblelemons> Why are they uprising by the way
<combustiblelemons> -MAYOR MARE
<ivan2294> The whole reason why we are rebelling is because of that
<prince-dari> GOOD THING I'M NEARLY INDESTRUCTABLE
<combustiblelemons> = EARTH PONY
<Cynder7> 6YOU ARE NOT.
<ivan2294> >implying Mayors are important
<Icy> 12D:
<combustiblelemons> yes they are
<ivan2294> Also >implying that's enough proof
<combustiblelemons> they get to decide how towns are built
<Flamerunner> If a war happens between Nightmare Moon (Luna turned back) and Celestia
<combustiblelemons> they get to control their town
<Sathia> Yes please!
<ivan2294> That is one, ONE POLITICIAN
<Flamerunner> damn i'm joining Nightmare Moon's side
<ivan2294> ONE POLITICIAN IS NOT ENOUGH
<Sathia> Shame it did not get played yesterday
<combustiblelemons> what's to say theres not more?
<combustiblelemons> flawed bro
<RarityFeelsSorry> Nighttime forever, and we lose the sun's energy
<combustiblelemons> completely flawed
<ivan2294> There probably are, but NOT ENOUGH
<ivan2294> Government is mostly Unicorn
<combustiblelemons> says only you.
<Quanyails> 7My cat is asleep and one of her eyes are still open. O.O
<Quanyails> 7is*
<Sathia> Looks europonies are more calm though :)
<SirSprinkles> 6Shame what didn't?
<ivan2294> And my guerilla army scattered across the land
<prince-dari> ONE CAN'T JUST GYRO INTO MORDOR
<Sathia> I can actually read the lines!
<Ponyman> i like ponies
<combustiblelemons> that listen to you why?
<RainBroDash> there's like 100 times less of us this stream :D
<Sathia> without having to scroll
<combustiblelemons> if you're wrong?
<MFW> D:

<ivan2294> And?
<Silverscreen> 11Barack Balboa?
<HyperMetalLugia> Creepy cat is creepy O.o
<ivan2294> Who said war was easy?
<prince-dari> GYRO BOWL IS MAGIC
<Icy> 12Sorry fellas, she's married... to science!
<Silverscreen> 11Numa numa :D

<SirSprinkles> 6I will never forget when I found this video.
<Nick> o-o uh is your cat ok quan?
<combustiblelemons> Gaddaffi's troops, low on morale
<Icy> 12GYROMASTER
<combustiblelemons> every powerful nation is against them
<ivan2294> Yes?
<ivan2294> Yep?
<Quanyails> 7Oh, and the eye's uncoordinated with the other one, which is slightly open. O_o
<prince-dari> So I told them gyro bowl was my God.
<combustiblelemons> the skies are no longer under their control
<Quanyails> 7And now she's awake. :U
<combustiblelemons> they're running out of resources
<prince-dari> THEN WE WORSHIPPED
<Quanyails> 7Yeah, I think she is, Nick.
<anoponymous> 0can we get equestria girls btw? :3
<rubenflonne> pinkazoid after x3
<CogWeaver> combustiblelemons
<ivan2294> But we aren't a conventional army like Gaddaffi's troopes
<Icy> 12<3
<combustiblelemons> yes cog?
<CogWeaver> stop feeding the parasprites
<prince-dari> Only Derpy can spill her cheerios out of a gyro bowl.
<combustiblelemons> alrighty then.
<ivan2294> More like a terror group
<combustiblelemons> I won this war about 30 minutes ago now
<ivan2294> Also, Why am I a parasprite?
<ivan2294> Only because of Celestia
<SirSprinkles> 6I have a list, adding to it as I go.
<ivan2294> Which is good enough for me
<CogWeaver> did I say you were a parasprite, ivan2294?
<Cynder7> 6Interesting...
<ivan2294> You implied it
<MFW> o gosh this video..
<ivan2294> And I'm assuming Lemons took it that way
<prince-dari> GYRO HARD!
<prince-dari> GYRO HARD!
<CogWeaver> how do you know? what gave you the implication that I implied anything?
<anoponymous> 0i have to say, this song fits her

<combustiblelemons> may we end arguments?
*ivan2294 laughs at Free's pain.
<ivan2294> Sure whatever
<prince-dari> When you put a gyro bowl in a gyro bowl, then try to spill the oatmeal in the second gyro bowl, then the universe implodes and a portal to Equestria forms.
<combustiblelemons> ---------------no arguments below this line-------------

<combustiblelemons> Flawless victory to pegasi and unicorns.

<CogWeaver> Like a BAWS http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/22296
<Icy> 12No
<ivan2294> It ain't no flawless victory when you have to change policies man ^_^
<Flamerunner> Pegasi are best pony species
<combustiblelemons> THe only trouble I really had was trying to get you to understand.
<Misery> i downloaded the ponybeat album but it didnt have this song :(
<prince-dari> Yes.
<Pusai> I actually like the metal part at the end of nightmare mode
<ivan2294> Same here, you never seemed to understand
<combustiblelemons> Sio i went nuclear.
<prince-dari> You disgrace the gyro bowl.
<CogWeaver> combustiblelemons, ivan2294, what are you discussing/arguing about?
<ivan2294> I don't even know anymore
<combustiblelemons> We're arguing about an argument TT_TT

<ivan2294> But Combustiblelemons I'm just saying you had to move all your civilians into clouds, make POW camps, starve anyone on the ground, and force the surrender of the entire earth pony population
<Barry> What song is this?
<ivan2294> Doesn't sound flawless to me
<SirSprinkles> 6Luna (DREAM MODE)
<prince-dari> I've read the 'Ben' thing before.
<anoponymous> 0ponybeat - luna
<combustiblelemons> Kind of does.
<ivan2294> Nope
<Barry> ah, I thought it was something different.
<Icy> I love ben
<combustiblelemons> What do you say there cog
<ivan2294> Flawless is when you barely have to do ANYTHING
<BroRainDash> o lawd
<combustiblelemons> ...
<Barry> I'll make a man out of you!
<ivan2294> That is some major policy change right there.
<Icy> Have you heard of the slender man?
<combustiblelemons> Flawless is when you win in all waus
<Silverscreen> 11The unofficial theme of /oat/
<prince-dari> Nope.

<ivan2294> So then what WOULD be a flawed victory?
<Arcesious> dangit...
<Arcesious> so hard getting this addon for chrome...
<Flamerunner> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25745
<Flamerunner> Mind = blown
<anoponymous> 0i know its THE song of filly's synchtube channel
<ivan2294> Exactly, and my goal was to see how far until you pulled that card on me
<Darf14> We must find a official theme then
<combustiblelemons> high pony casualties, not dealing with you properly...
<Sathia> indeed
*Cynder7 6looks it up out of curiosity.
<ivan2294> High pony casualties is right
<RainBroDash> tuuuuune

<RainBroDash> well of course. google owns youtube, they don't want chrome to support something that cripples their site's moneymaking ability :D
<anoponymous> 0BE A MARE
<Arcesious> I would use firefox, but for some reason it wouldn't let me view the video on firefox.
<Cynder7> 6And I'm supposed to go pretty soon.. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I switch between Chrome and Firefox on a regular basis.
<RainBroDash> but I prefer chrome anyway

<combustiblelemons> ARGUMENT = DEAD.
<ivan2294> OKAY

<BroRainDash> RainBroDash! You have thwarted my schemes! But alas! I am to return very shortly and with greater force and malevolence!
<Cynder7> 6I'm weird.. o.o
<RainBroDash> ;)
<combustiblelemons> I could do with some popcorn right now blankflank ;_;
<RainBroDash> <3
<BroRainDash> cya later
<Silverscreen> 11Anoponymous: It was Hasbro, not the show makers that did that.
<ivan2294> Me too
<Icy> So am I
<RainBroDash> you're like my evil nemesis now
<combustiblelemons> honey roasted maybe
<BroRainDash> xDD
<ivan2294> I have a huge box full of them downstairs
<ivan2294> Full of bags
<anoponymous> 0oh well, we can only discover that in season 2
<Icy> I've done nothing but watch crrepy stuff so far this summer >>
<Silverscreen> 11So it can be a conflict of interest between the company and the creators.
<Arcesious> oh boy
<anoponymous> 0if theyll introduce her again
<Mongoose> That Topic has given me cancer
<RainBroDash> i really hope they do. she's my 2nd favourite background pony
<anoponymous> 0until that i'd consider it canon
*BlankFlankBrony passes around popcorn
<combustiblelemons> the giant argument mongoose?
<Cynder7> 6Aaah..the joy of being weird.. ^^
<Silverscreen> 11Who else here thought DJ Pon-3 was a colt? *raises hand*
<RainBroDash> D:
<Mongoose> I give up
<Cynder7> 6My friend'd probably like this.. :P
<Darf14> *raises hand*
<combustiblelemons> *hugs mongoose*
<Icy> Send it...
<prince-dari> I hadn't really considered her gender either way until I saw that she was female.
<Mongoose> Oh, BlankFlank and His Popcorn.
<ivan2294> If only it were that easy BlankFlankBrony
<anoponymous> 0i thought RD was a colt for a looooong time
<combustiblelemons> sorry bro ^_^
<anoponymous> 0lime 3-4 episodes
<prince-dari> Really?
<RarityFeelsSorry> Devin Fox's girlfriend gave him cancer
<ivan2294> Also, why such an insulting name?
<RainBroDash> I just thought she was female, she looks it
<Silverscreen> 11seriously?
<prince-dari> I knew from the start all the main 6 were female.
<Silverscreen> 11I just figured she was a dyke.
<prince-dari> Though loads of people seem to think RD is male for some reason.
<BlankFlankBrony> Self-descriptive.
<ivan2294> How old are you?
<anoponymous> 0i didnt do any research before watching =)
<BlankFlankBrony> 29
<Mongoose> BlankFlank has no talent.
<anoponymous> 0so i was kinda clueless
<ivan2294> Surely you must have your mark by now
<prince-dari> Nor did I.
<prince-dari> I just watched it.
<combustiblelemons> *takes a hanfdful from blankflankbrony's popcorn bag*
<ZekeS|AFK> fix'd
<Free> Kill it.
<Silverscreen> 11The only research I did was seeing the endless fanart on FA and DA
<ivan2294> That's not how you spell Videogames
<BlankFlankBrony> Eh, I have some idea of what I'm good at, but I'm not sure what to do with my life. Hence...
<Silverscreen> 11oh, and a few PMVs
<Cynder7> 6Slender Man may stalk you,﻿ but Chuck Norris stalks Slender Man. Wtf. xD

<RarityFeelsOk> Kill it with fire

<anoponymous> 0I started from /b/'s ponythreads, no not much info was around back at the time =)
<JackiePie> I'm watching Adventure Time, lol Lumpy Space Princess.
<Misery> ew /b/
<CogWeaver> brb
<combustiblelemons> manure is suprisingly valuable
<prince-dari> Never been on 4chan.
<Misery> xD
<ivan2294> LSP is like totally
<Silverscreen> 11They're holding that pose for a while.
<Arcesious> I thought Rainbow Dash was male at first.
<JackiePie> OMG
<JackiePie> lol
<anoponymous> 0see
<Icy> Only Chuck Norris is that bad ass
<JackiePie> Hi Lucas
<rubenflonne> oh ya on the fucking moon!
<ivan2294> Adventure Time
<ivan2294> It's alright by me
<prince-dari> I always thought she was female. O_o
<combustiblelemons> hmm...
<ivan2294> So timothy are you ready for ADVENTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Lucas> hey
<Cynder7> 6xD

<ivan2294> Hey lady. Lady.
<RainBroDash> brb gonna go do some cooking
<ivan2294> *whispers* Ponies
<ZekeS|AFK> ivan2294: ENOUGH.
<RainBroDash> and put my chocolate in the fridge :3
<ZekeS|AFK> nut lol
<ivan2294> Okay
<ZekeS|AFK> *but
<combustiblelemons> Thankyou
<Silverscreen> 11I love that Luna Gif
<anoponymous> 0way to memorise the date of the human landing on the moon
<ZekeS|AFK> ... why is your name not capitalized?
<DJMidli> nut lol?
<ivan2294> Who what now?
<combustiblelemons> Zeke likes nuts ^_^
<Arcesious> oh this one is awesome too
<CogWeaver> back
<combustiblelemons> walnuts ftw
<ZekeS|AFK> Peanuts, walnuts, hazelnuts ...
<Silverscreen> 11I really hope they don't fuck up Luna's personality in Season Two.
<Arcesious> i have... lets see... 56 pony PMVs saved now.
<Silverscreen> 11She's my favorite outside of the Mane Cast.
<ivan2294> Pistachio is where it be at b*tches
<combustiblelemons> *brohoofs zeke*
<prince-dari> But she has no personality to ruin yet? O_o
<anoponymous> 0yeah indeed Silverscreen
<anoponymous> 0actually I have a lot of concerns abour derpy too
<BlankFlankBrony> Cashews?
<Arcesious> I'm scared what they'll do to luna
<JackiePie> Filburts?
<ivan2294> Cashews are good
<ivan2294> WAIT
<Silverscreen> 11Prince-Dari: She has a fanon personality that, IMO, is spot on for the little bit of character we've seen.
<combustiblelemons> meh.
<anoponymous> 0so with lyra and bonbon
<prince-dari> I hope they don't call Derpy "Ditzy Doo".
<ivan2294> WE GET DERAILED SO EASILY
<Barry> She only had two lines so far. There's not much personality to get from that
<CogWeaver> eeeyup
<ivan2294> Spelling Mistake = New topic
<prince-dari> I don't really bother with fanmade stuff other than art.
<Cynder7> 6http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/vehura/Slender%20Man/SlenderMan05.jpg ftw. :P
<ivan2294> lol
<Arcesious> I roleplay Luna all the time so I already have expectations...
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<Darf14> wow...Psychoshy has gotten 20% creepier
<CogWeaver> olo
<combustiblelemons> I'm allergic to pistachios D:
<Silverscreen> 11Prince-Dari: They're going with Ditzy Doo as the canon name, with Derpy being her canon nickname.
<ivan2294> Sup AgnitioExMachina
<BlankFlankBrony> Awwww...
<JackiePie> Hi Agnitio
<AgnitioExMachina> sup
<Arcesious> A character that is a cross between Fluttershy and Twilight is my ideal idea of Luna's personality.
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Silverscreen> 11Arc: I know. :P
<ivan2294> We were just talking about nuts
<Barry> Exactly, it's a personality from fans. We'll see if Hasbro keeps to the fans, or if they generate an entirely new personality for her
<AgnitioExMachina> Cool
<CogWeaver> eeyup
<anoponymous> 0I am almost certain canon representation of Derpy and Luna wont match fan's expectations. The only question is - how badly
<ivan2294> I prefer pistachio all the way
<combustiblelemons> surprisingly short story, zeke said nut lol instead of but lol
<prince-dari> I don't think something so major should be decided by fans though.
<anoponymous> 0i hope it wont be too bad
<Arcesious> oh boy
<Silverscreen> 11Anoponymous: thus my statement: I hope they don't fuck them up too much.
<prince-dari> Things like that tend to end badly.
<Free> Kill it.
<JackiePie> Nice story bro
<combustiblelemons> and thus this topic was born
<Arcesious> this has been done too?
<ivan2294> YOU HAVE TO SPELL IT RIGHT
<ivan2294> IT'S SPELLED SPIKE
<Arcesious> anyone seen the pokemon pony pmv yet?
<combustiblelemons> *derailed*
<ivan2294> BE
<anoponymous> 0the only way they can get away with it is to have very subtle Derpy occurance
<ivan2294> BEE
<CogWeaver> crap, it cut it off!
<ivan2294> Bees discuss
<CogWeaver> nooooo!
<anoponymous> 0like in feeling pinkie kin
<Icy> Is dat....? :D

<DJMidli> Bees? Birds and bees and appletrees, and hot nuts?
<anoponymous> 0not screwing anything and fueling fandom for more theories and ideas
<Cynder7> 6It is him..
<AgnitioExMachina> I'M COVERED IN BEES
<ivan2294> And that is how you start a new topic
<ivan2294> ^_^
<DJMidli> are you ready for the summer
<combustiblelemons> How'd it get burned?
<BlankFlankBrony> Are we sure we're in the right room for this topic?

<Fiddler> brony is gender neutral
<AgnitioExMachina> yep
<ivan2294> oh yeah, Filly
<Silverscreen> Eh. I put a post in Daily /oat/ about it, that's why I asked.

<combustiblelemons> 2 anomalies collide to create a portal to equestria maybe
<AgnitioExMachina> I want to emulate me playing some old games
<Fiddler> we need to pony
<AgnitioExMachina> I mean recorders
<AgnitioExMachina> w.e.
<AgnitioExMachina> PC games
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Yeah, gonna type up a D&D mod for Equestria Campaigns; care or not.
<combustiblelemons> where the mutants go through
<CogWeaver> so I've been experimenting with MLP design...
<combustiblelemons> is equestria doomed?
<CogWeaver> ...I've come to the conclusion...
<Silverscreen> 11SWEET!
<combustiblelemons> which is cog?
<CogWeaver> ...that Humans cannot be drawn in the same way that the Ponies and other critters are drawn...
<Flamerunner> LO.
<Silverscreen> 11no one man should have all that powah
<CogWeaver> ...they get too creepy looking...
*Kosoveon is sending his Dad a prom picture XD;
<BlankFlankBrony> Uncanny Vally, huh?
<combustiblelemons> TRY HARDER
<BlankFlankBrony> *Valley
<AgnitioExMachina> It's called Uncanny Valley, actually
<CogWeaver> eeeyup
<NightSeas> 12derp
<CogWeaver> Uncanny Valley TO THE MAX
<combustiblelemons> huh?
<Flamerunner> After the Nightmare Moon / Celestia war, "The Fire" started
<CogWeaver> well, not the max
<Silverscreen> 11So...is everypony just silently watching this?
<combustiblelemons> whats uncanny valley?
<CogWeaver> but pretty far down there
<Flamerunner> making everyone live in the newly made metro stations
<animefan222> yes
<WhatPayne> I am
<Pusai> Yes
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm attempting to not get RAEPed by Skype sounds.
<AgnitioExMachina> Google it
<DragonRage> I've been browsing ponychan and ponibooru, sorry.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't have any pictures from my prom LOL
<Silverscreen> 11Kinda kills the purpose of a chat, doesn't it?
<drf|away> 03I didn't go to my prom
<drf|away> 03:D
<CogWeaver> The uncanny valley is an inverted bell-curve, where the more realisitc something is, the more creepy it gets
<Angel_Espeon> 13mainly because I refused to have pictures taken of me |D
<combustiblelemons> ahh
<CogWeaver> but of course, it comes back up further along the curve
<anoponymous> 0possibly ^_^
<Kosoveon> I did, but only because I had to do so for my ASB
<AgnitioExMachina> The more realistic yet obviously fake it is
<Flamerunner> about it
<Flamerunner> <Lightning_Quickhoof> See, I was thinking more like E
<Flamerunner> wait
<Flamerunner> dean't man tha
<AgnitioExMachina> the creepier
<drf|away> 03ASB?

<anoponymous> 0send it to the moon
<Silverscreen> 11Cool.
<Misery> was reading a thread
<combustiblelemons> detail makes everything creepier
<Fiddler> we must see real life ponies
<animefan222> what is this vid called
<BlankFlankBrony> Full explaination: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley
<CogWeaver> not always, Lemons
<CogWeaver> Thanks, Blank
<Kosoveon> i'll be the treasurer for mine next year :B
<combustiblelemons> well the more you add the creepier they become
<Silverscreen> 11I myself was checking the Brony State Gmail account, of course, so I can't say too much. :P
<CogWeaver> ...to an extent
*BlankFlankBrony has TVtropes bookmarked
<anoponymous> 0PONIES The Anthology
<HyperMetalLugia> WKR?
<drf|away> 03what grade are you in? o.o

<Fiddler> NO! no tvtropes
<CogWeaver> if you keep adding details, you'll eventually come out of the valley, just on the other side
<Fiddler> that is my drugs
<NightSeas> 12834 grade
<CogWeaver> on the "Real Life" side
<JackiePie> LoL, Tree Trunks from Adventure time in makeup.

<Kosoveon> for some schools around here it's sophomores too
<combustiblelemons> oops
<drf|away> 03weird
<CogWeaver> But anyways, I've come to the conclusion that Humans have little chance of ever appearing in the show in a way that remains consistant with the rest of the show's art style
<Misery> lol
<RainBroDash> oh yes, the Cage breakdown!
<Fiddler> i could have evolved with all that wasted time
<Silverscreen> 11RainbroDash: Pretty much, until we actually watch the movie. XD
<drf|away> 03here you have to be a senior or dating a senior
<combustiblelemons> i think that will do it
<Silverscreen> 11NOT THE BEES!
<drf|away> 03but ew high school relationships anyway
<Silverscreen> 11IN MY EYES!
<SilverSonic> lol
<RainBroDash> I never sign up for the lottery, because I'd crumble under the pressure of choosing a film
<Fiddler> i hope humans never appear
<Misery> haha
<BlankFlankBrony> Fiddler: Does this mean that the time spent on TVtropes is the only thing keeping you from turning into a pony?
<RainBroDash> but I will for that film
<RainBroDash> from now on
<Fiddler> si
<Silverscreen> 11Awesome.
<drf|away> 03I'm serious
<RainBroDash> so we can have turbo chat going NOT THE BEEEEEEES

<RainBroDash> that would be -sick-.
<Silverscreen> 11My next choice for BMN will be Sapceballs. :D
<RainBroDash> :D
*NightSeas hides
<Silverscreen> 11Oh god.
<RainBroDash> Good move
<Silverscreen> 11the turbo chat there.
<Sathia> hahaha
<CogWeaver> eh, it could be interesting if it remains canon and completely 100% fictional and no where near any pre-conceived notions of humanity
<Sathia> classic
<Silverscreen> 11It'll be so horrible.
<RainBroDash> xD
<Sathia> B movie ofc?
<Fiddler> what point could humans have appearing in Equestria?
<CogWeaver> basically, you could have humanoid creatures, but they couldn't be Earth-Humans
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Yay!
<Flamerunner> i'm downloading GIMP
<CogWeaver> add to the show...?
<Arcesious> are we watching ytp now?
<CogWeaver> I don't know
<Arcesious> it sure looks like it...
<Silverscreen> 11Arc: no, it's a PMV
<drf|away> 03I seriously hate Apple
<drf|away> 03my friend wants me to put songs on his iPod
<Silverscreen> 11It's better than YTP
<drf|away> 03and it took me like 5 minutes
<drf|away> 03to get it to work
<CogWeaver> what point could Ponies have in appearing on a screen in our everyday lives?
<Misery> what is ytp?
<drf|away> 03the device kept freezing when I plugged it in
<Silverscreen> 11Youtube poop
<Barry> Youtube Poop
<BlankFlankBrony> To make it better.
<Misery> oh
<SirSprinkles> 6If I ever get B movie, we're watching Hobgoblins.
<drf|away> 03not to mention iTunes itself is a pile of crap
<prince-dari> Some YTP is better than some PMVs though.
<Fiddler> they reaffrim our humanity
<CogWeaver> that's besides the point
<NightSeas> 12Was it an old iPod?
<drf|away> 03it's a Nano
<RainBroDash> asdasgjusiggG Silver imagine if we both won the lottery, and the A movie was the Wicker Man, B movie was Spaceballs
<prince-dari> I rate things individually, not as a whole.
<Silverscreen> 11XD
<drf|away> 03the generation before they made it the size of a postage stamp
<RainBroDash> that night would be amazing
<NightSeas> 12Ew Nano
<Cynder7> 6You has no proof!
<drf|away> 03ew ANY iPods
<Darf14> I want Derpy vision
<Silverscreen> 11Applebloom knows of band camp.
<anoponymous> 0Spaceballs is a B movie?
<anoponymous> 0wut?
<prince-dari> Not the bees!
<Silverscreen> 11Spaceballs qualifies as either.
<Arcesious> meh
<SirSprinkles> 6The Battle of Algiers for A movie.
<RainBroDash> :P
<Icy> She told me herself
<combustiblelemons> what's GIMP like?
<RainBroDash> so much skype noises rape :D
<rubenflonne> would like to see a nightmare on elm street on one of the nights x3
<Silverscreen> 11Since it's a parody, it qualifies as a B movie. Since it's got a good budget, it qualifies as an A movie. :D
<Misery> does it actually matter what movie you pick if you get to pick the A movie?
<RainBroDash> WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<SirSprinkles> 6It happens as soon as I go to type in here.
<combustiblelemons> I think the only thing that puts me off looking it up is the name
<anoponymous> 0well, its one of the best star wars spoofs =)
<Flamerunner> it's like photoshop more crappy.
<NightSeas> 12iPod touch is spectacular though
<combustiblelemons> oh
<drf|away> 03no
<drf|away> 03it's a pile of crap
<Flamerunner> btw i made this in Paint.NET, what you guys think? http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png
<combustiblelemons> I have photoshop ^_^
<drf|away> 03he has one of those too, it freezes just as much
<Arcesious> really? csi?
<Cynder7> 6It told me that it was a he.
<Arcesious> REALLY?
<BlankFlankBrony> Not bad, Flame.
<Arcesious> wow...
<Silverscreen> 11It's the song itself, not CSI
<Icy> She lied
<Flamerunner> thanks.
<NightSeas> 12I have one, almost never freezes o-o
<Cynder7> 6He did not.
<CogWeaver> I guess, if anything, having them there would add to our knowledge of what Equestria's like - does it cover the whole planet, and any other creatures like Griffons and the like just live there within it? or are there other lands ruled by other the creatures (humans-humaniod like creatures included)?
<Misery> ew deathnote
<Silverscreen> 11Christian Bale made Fluttershy cry.
<Silverscreen> 11HE MUST PAY!
<Icy> :<
<combustiblelemons> it's better than those crappy OC characters seth posted up
<drf|away> 03you got lucky
<combustiblelemons> by a long shot
<prince-dari> Wait, CSI what?
<CogWeaver> I still have yet to look at those
<CogWeaver> brb
<BlankFlankBrony> As art, they're not bad.
<Silverscreen> 11Who Are You is the theme song for CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
<Fiddler> i am an OC

<Revolver> IT'S REFLECTIVE.
<Sathia> suggestion: more music :)
<Silverscreen> 11Nick looses it.
<BlankFlankBrony> You must pour additional sauce!
<Revolver> MUD IS REFLECTIVE!
<Lucas> jumped comps
<Ihrida> So in the case of floof being fluff
<Revolver> I SHOT THE MUD WITH AIRSOFT GUN; IT COMES BACK AND HITS ME IN THE EYE.
<Ihrida> Floofing would be fluffing?
<Revolver> STUPID SCIENCE, HOW DOES IT WORK?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes :P
<Ihrida> So you're puffing Espeon up?
<prince-dari> Should be doing work, meh. :/
<Wierdplatformer> Blank this song id epic
<Angel_Espeon> 13You could say that :3
<Ihrida> Ohhhhhhh
<Kosoveon> it's an esoteric code
<CogWeaver> Science: You can't explain that.
<Kosoveon> that only a select few can master ;3
<NightSeas> 12Floof is complicated :3
<Wierdplatformer> I thought that was magic?
<Ray> 02brb~

<Lucas> The one w/o numbers
<Espeon> 06Silly Pinkeon.
<Cynder7> 6The fook?
<prince-dari> I have no way of proving this, but It's still pretty neat. Apparently someone over at JFK is a brony, and dropped this quote over the intercom
<SirSprinkles> 6...he said pony.
<prince-dari> "There has been a security issue involving Derpy Hooves. Maintenance crew to Gate 3."
<Wierdplatformer> TECHNO!!!
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3c

<User_3303> Howdy.
<prince-dari> It's pink for me.
<ZekeS> wtf
<CogWeaver> sup
<prince-dari> Bright pink, default IRC settings.
<Rarity_RP> Bah
<prince-dari> Still looks fine on a white background though.
<Lucas> rev comme on
<Rarity_RP> Died on 2nd Ballos form again
<Ihrida> I don't have default. It hurt my eyes.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Espeon uses purple text, I use pink xD
<Revolver> Okay, PT needs to make himself some food or s-

<HyperMetalLugia> I hate people who complain about white ;p
<CogWeaver> Not much, User_3303
<Silverscreen> 11Am I the only one who thought this guy's brother looks like said superman villain?
<Flutterbro> Applejack is actually the least awesomesterest actually.
<Revolver> No.
<HyperMetalLugia> 0,0 Like tis
<Ihrida> The rainbow thing's what I was talking about.
<CogWeaver> no
<User_3303> Oh, wait a sec...
<Wierdplatformer> no
<User_4487Rev1> Yes.
<Revolver> Applejack is amazing.
<CogWeaver> indeed
<HolyJunkie> There we go.
<Lucas> Rev...
<Revolver> Cog, don't you agree-
<Flutterbro> Shit tier pony is shit tier.
<Revolver> See.
<Ihrida> My mIRC background's black.
<Lucas> :/
<Fiddler> RARITY IS #1
<Revolver> My point.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew
<Revolver> I don't care where Rarity is.
<CogWeaver> Rarity = annoying
<User_4487Rev1> Applejack is not amazing. Impressive, maybe... But not amazing.
<Rarity_RP> Why, thank you.
<HyperMetalLugia> Black IRC backgrounds are ugly
<Rarity_RP> WHAT
<Ihrida> It's <3 for my eyes.
<NightSeas> 12But before that you where saying it. [18:09] <Ihrida> Such bright text... .___.
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, only EMOS use them :>
<Flamerunner> Rarity is a whining...
<Ihrida> Yeah

<Fiddler> rarity is the mose raritiest pony ever
<Ihrida> Espeon's looks bright yellow
<Revolver> Rarity is my new hero.
<Rarity_RP> Whining? I complain.
<Ihrida> That's what I was talking about.
<Flamerunner> Keep it PG Flame...
<Flamerunner> Keep it PG.
<CogWeaver> rarity is a whining mule
<Revolver> For knowing what Cave Story is.
<Rarity_RP> Do you want whining?
<User_4487Rev1> Luna, I can go with.
<ZekeS> >:|
<HyperMetalLugia> See, instead of screwing up all my backrounds...I just keep my laptop's monitor on a less bright setting ;p
<CogWeaver> DANG IT ZEKE ):|
<ZekeS> :3
<Revolver> Cave Story is more important than RP, Lucas.
<Ihrida> Hey, I'm not emo. I just have horrible sensetivity to bright colors. D:
<Revolver> HUZZAH!
<HyperMetalLugia> That way I can keep white without any major eyehurt
<prince-dari> Go to google.
<HolyJunkie> Wait, what's happening? I am already lost.
<Flamerunner> Cave Johnson is more improtant than Cave Story
<prince-dari> Type in real men watch
<ZekeS> hahahah
<HyperMetalLugia> (And black on white hurts my eyes more LOL)
<Espeon> 06Yes, I am tired @ Angel_Espeon xD

<Rarity_RP> Geezus no
<Ihrida> It's pretty bland.
<SilverSonic> lmfao i fail at OoT, I couldnt get past the first boss for a long time because i forgotten where it was |D XD
<Icy> I see yoooouu
<Ihrida> I set my text to appear orange to me.
<Revolver> Cave Johnson IN Cave Story maybe.
<SilverSonic> ah well, i beat it anywas XD
<NightSeas> 12I like black highlighted text xD 1,0Like this
*Fluttershy_RP Flutter Shys
<SilverSonic> anyways*
<HyperMetalLugia> SS, OOT 3D or OOT 64?
<prince-dari> Google knows what real men watch.
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Cynder7> 6I see you too!
<CogWeaver> there we go
<NightSeas> 12derp, fail
<Cynder7> 6*icywave*
<nickstr> which is my typical response for the coldest and most arrogant response you can give anyone
<SilverSonic> OOT Virtual Console
<SilverSonic> :P
<NightSeas> 1,1More like this xD
<Revolver> Hi, I'm Cave Johnson, and this is a Mimiga!
<Cynder7> 6xDDDDDD
<HyperMetalLugia> Looks terrible .v.
<Icy> PERVERT! *slaps*
<Revolver> Furry litte creatures seem to defy gravity.
<Lucas> Rev, if you can;t even walk down, without going back upo to just even comment among people who really want you to go dwonstairs..
<Ihrida> I set mIRC to default. The text is what it's supposed to be, but ugh, that background.
<CogWeaver> Curse you Derpy!!
<Cynder7> 6Le pwn!
<Wierdplatformer> I am completely confused
<Fluttershy_RP> King is the bestest mimiga ever.
<Flamerunner> Derpy is right
<CogWeaver> yes, she is...
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> lol!
<Icy> Nope
<HyperMetalLugia> Use a CRT or sunglasses when using a computer? :D
<Revolver> Can jump as high as a basketball goal without even trying.
<CogWeaver> ...but even so...
<Revolver> Makes testing a lot more fun.
<Revolver> *Shows King*
<Ihrida> Why would I do that if I can just make the background dark?
<CogWeaver> ...Applejack is still the best
<Ihrida> XD
<Revolver> *King just stares at camera*
<Fluttershy_RP> King should have a game dedicated solely to himself.
<Cynder7> 6*icypokeofevilness*
<Fluttershy_RP> Like Edgeworth
<Espeon> 06Kind of slow yes ~
<Revolver> Yesh.
<HyperMetalLugia> But that ruins everything else :<
<Revolver> I am behind this notion.
<Lucas> Rev...
<Lucas> COmeon
<HyperMetalLugia> Then you'll want Windows to have black backrounds
<CogWeaver> or at least...she's the best of the canon...
<ZekeS> d'awww
<Lucas> I'm active now, so why aren't.
<Revolver> CS is more important to me than RP.
<Ihrida> It does. XD
<Lucas> CS?
<ZekeS> They're shoing a show about kittens on Animal planet
<Revolver> Cave Story.
<Icy> Oh yes! *rolls around rubbing my arms*
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, I'll probably go to sleep when you do
<ZekeS> have fun with the topic war!
<HyperMetalLugia> Then you're doing it wrong
<Lucas> -_-
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Angel_Espeon> 13Getting a bit tired myself xD
<Cynder7> 6May I also say that I'll hopefully add you quite soon. :3
<Lucas> Cave Story...
<Lucas> Why?
<Cynder7> 6D:
<Ihrida> I personalized the crap out of my laptop. xD
<Icy> What?
<Revolver> Is the most amazing platform game ever.
<HyperMetalLugia> Set the text to black and profit, it's a great idea for everything to be black XD
<Revolver> EVER.
<Revolver> OF ALL TIME.
<Ihrida> I couldn't read it, then. :P
*Cynder7 6pulls the poke away immediately.
<Revolver> IT ONLY CAME OUT IN 2005.
<Icy> Get portal 2
<HyperMetalLugia> OH, Ihirda, if you dislike bright...just turn off the computer, all problems solved!
*HyperMetalLugia FLEES
<Lucas> And you're talking aobut it in a PONy board..
<Cynder7> 6Ze PS3
<CogWeaver> of ALL of the ponies, though, canon AND fanon....? I'd have to say that [----] is the best pony ever...
<Revolver> AND THEY HAVE ALREADY SCREWED IT OVER WITH A WII VERSION.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> I guess i won the topic war!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Genius advice
<SilverSonic> LMFAO
<Lucas> Like Starfox COmmand?
<SilverSonic> Dont follow that advice
<SilverSonic> :
<SilverSonic> :P*
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Free> That was fast.
<Lucas> Screwed over some of the SF stuff
<Ihrida> Not at all, I have everything set to dark colours. o:
<Cynder7> 6What's it like?
<HyperMetalLugia> Well complainers need my advice to set them on the right track ;p
<Kosoveon> add a few hundred lamps aimed right at your eyes :B
<Revolver> Granted, the Wii version's MUSIC only sucked, and you can fix that, but still.
<Kosoveon> then the colors will actually seem darker by comparison :D
<Revolver> CPU version's still free.
<Rarity_RP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BEIt0L43V4&feature=related
<Revolver> 3DS version is coming.

<Wierdplatformer> Tangled
<Icy> Pretty damn fun and funny
<HyperMetalLugia> My right eye is very sensitive to light outside, so I actually have to close it when wear glasses sometimes ;P
<Ihrida> I set mIRC to default, then just changed a few things. Now text colour's what it should be.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> There we go!
<HyperMetalLugia> But isn't the white text too bright :<
<Flamerunner> Sellin' hidden blades in EAD
*Cynder7 6looks it up on YT
<Ihrida> No, the text is grey.
<Coz> Much better XD

<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Silverscreen> 11So that was a season finale?
<Joshabaloo> Hii

<Lucas> Besides, everything I told him, he never got the reference..
<NightSeas> 0,1Whee
<Bazul> Derpy, you are SO oatmeal!
<HyperMetalLugia> Now set 0 = White and 1= Black
<Ihrida> x.x
<Bazul> excuse me as I google it for a second time
*Muffin_Overlord_Derpy OATMEAL le gasp
<HyperMetalLugia> This way, everything should be white and black ;3
*Revolver le gasp le gasp
<Ihrida> That'd be so boring. .___.
<Bazul> ohhh, I know the game
<Bazul> i think i forgot to google it the first time, and then forgot that I forgot
<HyperMetalLugia> Well it stops all the brightness ;o
*Sathia yawns softly
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lowering the brightness of the screen itself works fine too
<HyperMetalLugia> Or something, pink is much brighter than white :p
<Ihrida> I have dark colours. I don't need all black. XD
<Ihrida> White looks brighter to me.
<HyperMetalLugia> I misread a "I hate dark colours"
<Rarity_RP> I feel accidentallied
*Micro_Nick feels sleepy
*CogWeaver is speechless*
<CogWeaver> I
<CogWeaver> You
<CogWeaver> WHAT?!?
<HyperMetalLugia> Then see a eye specialist, you need help!@
<Wierdplatformer> will be back after movie see ya

<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<Lucas> Rev, ready to come back down?
<Bazul> soooooooo, what do you guys think of the Pixelart post? :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Contacts are tacky
<Angel_Espeon> 13Laser eye surgery, do eet
<HyperMetalLugia> Glasses FTW
<Cynder7> 6A very minor case of serious brain damage? o.o
<Vividkinz> Beast, that's what.

<Icy> I love that part
<Coz> lol fail
<CogWeaver> okay, there we go
<Bazul> o hai there Vividkinz
<Cynder7> 6I must say..It does look quite interesting.. :3
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> ...
<Ihrida> They haven't stopped changing.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I wouldn't get laser eyes surgery myself
<Vividkinz> Hi bazul P:
<Angel_Espeon> 13paranoid they'd go wrong |D
<Boltz> haha look at their hair
<Icy> I'd be nice to play witha friend
<Bazul> He didn't post the link to the map though :(
<Bazul> which was kinda the main thing
<HyperMetalLugia> I would, if I could without fear :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm paranoid it'll hurt
<Bazul> but I asked again
<Ihrida> Me too, but I'm doing it anyways. XD
<BlankFlankBrony> The pixelart looks impressive... too bad I've never played MC.
<Angel_Espeon> 13My cousin had it and apparently it doesn't hurt at all
<Revolver> *salutes* Heil CogWeaver!
<CogWeaver> okay, ONE last change...
<Bazul> you should :3
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> OKAY!
<CogWeaver> okay, we're DONE
<Angel_Espeon> 13they put something on your eyes that numbs it
<CogWeaver> LEAVE IT
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> OATMEAL!
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is why I dislike contacts, too dangers to be stuffing things in your eye :x
<Cynder7> 6:3
*Muffin_Overlord_Derpy le gasp
<HyperMetalLugia> *dangerous
<Kosoveon> my dad had it
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Icy> :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice
*Revolver le gasp le gasp
<Cynder7> 6I like how the room's falling apart :O
<Kosoveon> he said it was not nearly as scary as people made it out to be
<Bazul> [/legasp]
*Muffin_Overlord_Derpy le muffin
<HyperMetalLugia> How did it go?
<Ihrida> What's dangerous about contacts? XD
<Bazul> oh god...
<Cynder7> 6This came out last year,right?
<Angel_Espeon> 13you DO have to be fully awake during the whole procedure though :P
<Bazul> Derpy, you are le oatmeal
<Kosoveon> true
<Angel_Espeon> 13and you apparently see everything they do xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm...eye scratching, infections..cleaning, hard lenses
<Kosoveon> but my dad is like the most fidgety person ever so XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Replacing them all the time :P
<Revolver> WHOO!
<Icy> Came out in april
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> C'est amusant!
<Silverscreen> 11I actually hate Kenan's hairstyle like this. :|
<Ihrida> Hard lenses like
<CogWeaver> lol, I wanna see Fire's reaction to that...
<Lucas> Rev...
<Ihrida> Don't exist anymore.
<CogWeaver> "Derpy is oatmeal...WTF?!?"
<HyperMetalLugia> Hard as in old contacts
<Revolver> I have been listening too Pinkie Pie's WHOO for FIFTEEN MINUTES!
<Revolver> FIFTEEN!
<Silverscreen> 11Considering the movie we've recently watched, that's just creepy.
<HyperMetalLugia> Which are very...uncomfortable :<
<Ihrida> You're supposed to take them out every night, and put in a new pair every month.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ew contact lenses
<Ihrida> Takes care of all problems. XD
<CogWeaver> ONE FIVE!
<Cynder7> 6Ok..Just want to know for price and shizzle :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I can wear my glasses 24/7 and keep them forever/over 2 years
<Angel_Espeon> 13what if you get something in your eye and you feel the need to rub your eye
<Bazul> FIVE MULTIPLIED BY THREE!
<Aurora> contacts are amazing
*Flamerunner Le Came
<Flamerunner> lol wat
<Bazul> thank god I got that right
<Aurora> 6people panic about them
<Aurora> 6but
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope.flv
<CogWeaver> SEVEN POINT FIVE MULTIPLIED BY TWO!
<Aurora> 6they're not bad
<Icy> $60 here
<Ihrida> I've had a cyst on my eye from them. Not because the contacts sucks, but because I slept in them.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I daren't try them, I hate putting things in my eyes ;;
<Aurora> 6it's the first week that's torture
<HyperMetalLugia> You should panic more ;D
<Kosoveon> contacts sound uncomfortable
<Kosoveon> ah
<Ihrida> Pff, I rub my eyes all the time. xD
<Flamerunner> 15
<Aurora> 6I cried the first time
<Cynder7> 6Carp. >.<
<Bazul> i pressed enter and then thought "wait.... that's wrong"
<Aurora> 6but after that it was whatever
<Flamerunner> FIFTEEN!
<Aurora> 6kind of like how diabetics can take shots like candy after a while
<Ihrida> I had no problems at all, except getting the things in.
<Icy> Totally worth it though
<Bazul> I'm gonna go ahead and shamelessly promote myself here: http://bloodisgood.org/minecraft/pony/#/-1408/64/128/-3
<Aurora> 6weird analogy but yeh
<HyperMetalLugia> Pfft, eyecysts from something that is supposed to help you see
<CogWeaver> NO, NOT FIFTY! FIFTEENokay we should stop using caps now...
<HyperMetalLugia> Ironic XD
<Ihrida> I have tiny eyes. x.x
<Aurora> 6yeh I actually play with my contacts by rubbing my eyes
<Silverscreen> 11Is this an auto playlist?
<Aurora> 6and forcing them up into my eyelid and letting them slide back into place
<Vividkinz> Bad Bazul.
<prince-dari> Or you could pirate it.
<prince-dari> :P
<Bazul> we need suggestions on who to put in two of the corners
<Angel_Espeon> 13Gah, I can't watch diabetics take shots at all x_x
<Cynder7> 6Wait,I'll look it up on some site
<HyperMetalLugia> That sounds..disgusting
<Bazul> why so bad Bazul me?
<Cynder7> 6Meh.. :P
<Vividkinz> Because I said so. >:U
<Aurora> 6my boyfriend is diabetic, so I have to leave the room when he takes shots
<Ihrida> I got a cyst because I was doing it wrong, not because of the contacts themselves
<Silverscreen> 11>.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Then taking their blood suger >.>
<prince-dari> Why is it disgusting? O_o
<Aurora> 6I have a major needle phobia
<Bazul> :'( ok...
<Silverscreen> 11god...that's...so accurate.
<Ihrida> I slept in them for about 8 months and never hanged them.
<Aurora> 6...
<Icy> Arrrg
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Aurora> 6YOU SLEPT IN THEM?
<HyperMetalLugia> WAT
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Ihrida> *changed
<HyperMetalLugia> FOOLS
<Angel_Espeon> 13In fact just the thought of injecting yourself with a needle makes me feel uncomfortable .w.
<Ihrida> I did. XD
<Aurora> 6that's horrible
<Ihrida> Now I don't, obviously.
<SirSprinkles> 6No auto playlist.
<Aurora> 6yeh
<HyperMetalLugia> Get glasses if you want to sleep with good vision
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Just clicking whatever I see.
<Silverscreen> 11ah.
<Ihrida> Having an eye cyst scareds you out of that
<Aurora> 6iI've slept in contact all of 3 times in the past 6 years
<Ihrida> I can't wear glasses
<CogWeaver> dude...what's with the wall off in the distance? it looks baws
<Cynder7> 6 59 euros.. D:
<HyperMetalLugia> Whynot?
<HyperMetalLugia> O.,o
<Ihrida> I have a pair
<Aurora> 6and those were all at sleepovers when I forgot to bring my contact cases and solution
<Ihrida> I can't wear them anymore
<rubenflonne> inflation of cash :D
<Icy> Hmmmmm
<Aurora> 6I have glasses, I refuse to wear them outside of my house
<HyperMetalLugia> Get a new one?
<Ihrida> I did
<Bazul> thats the Citadel
<HyperMetalLugia> I wear my glasses all the time, lulz
<Ray> 02^
<Ihrida> Everything looks wrong.
<Kosoveon> glasses are cool
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have glasses now, I only wear them when I REALLY need to
<Icy> Get a job... like I did... I hate my job... *sighs*
<Silverscreen> 11Again...that's frighteningly accurate.
<Bazul> the Royal Citadel
<Kosoveon> i dont know why some people find them to be uncool :B
<Bazul> soon to contain temples to the Princesses
<Ray> 02Glasses 22/7 here,
<Kosoveon> or maybe I'm just that nerdy I dunno XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I get self-conscious about what I look like wearing them ^^;
<Ihrida> Everything looks smaller and farther away, and I can't look sideways withoiut not being able to see
<HyperMetalLugia> See, when I'm reading/using the laptop, I would like to have vision correction that I can take off in a instant
<NightSeas> 12[18:33] <Ihrida> Everything looks wrong. <-- Then you don't have the right ones ;x
<Ihrida> I can't wear them.
<Ihrida> I got new ones
<CogWeaver> I see...
<Aurora> 6glasses are uncomfortable for me
<HyperMetalLugia> I made sure my lenses are big, so no big issues :P
<Bazul> I should hope so
<Ihrida> And when I complained, they gave me another pair
<Ihrida> XD
<Flamerunner> oh god
<Aurora> 6plus, I wear sunglasses A LOT
<CogWeaver> you should make a shrine to Lyra
<Flamerunner> Half-life 2 + MLP came to my mind
<Cynder7> 6Meh..So far I think to get PS3 with the two games I've chosen to get it's about 406 euros..Idk if I could get it yet -.-
<CogWeaver> Phoe commands it
<Ihrida> I'm too sued to contacts to wear glasses now.
<HyperMetalLugia> We saw Aurora, those pictures
<Flamerunner> Ville 17
<Ihrida> *used
<Aurora> 6and i refuse to get UV sensitive glasses
<Bazul> hmmmmmmmm, perhaps...
<Angel_Espeon> 13Can't remember the last time I wore sunglasses |D
<Joshabaloo> haha
<Bazul> but she will need a village of her own
<HyperMetalLugia> I want a pair of UV Glasses LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just squint in sunlight and hope for the best LOL
<Cynder7> 6What other games do you have with multiplayer and stuff? :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, just for my right eye
<Bazul> we have a lot of work to do right now though
<Rainbow_Claus> You just delayed EP3 another day.
<Ihrida> My glasses are UV sensetive. It was free.
<CogWeaver> EP3?
<Flamerunner> YAY.
<Bazul> our mane projects are this 65k block pixelart, the citadel and 4 giant 3d ponies
<HyperMetalLugia> Wat
<BlankFlankBrony> We have ponies. We'll survive.
<Ray> 02Wat.
<Vividkinz> Half life episode 3.
<Cynder7> 6I haven't given the job thing much thought..
<CogWeaver> ah
<HyperMetalLugia> My glasses are like over 400$
<Angel_Espeon> 13I could've gotten UV sensitive glasses if I wanted to
<Icy> Marvel vs capcom 3 and tf war for cybertron
<Rainbow_Claus> Half Life 2: Episode Three has been delayed another day!
<Ihrida> Mine would have been if I didn't have awesome insurance.
<Angel_Espeon> 13chose not to because I knew I'd hardly ever wear them anyway :B
<Kosoveon> i use to wear glasses for reading
<Ihrida> They were only like, $100.
<Aurora> 6I'm highly photosensitive unfortunately
<HyperMetalLugia> Since I have a special pair, one lens is convex and the other is concave LOL
<Ray> 02I have a 50$ one. It has leasted over 3 years |D
<Aurora> 6I can't drive without sunglasses
<Rainbow_Claus> Pinkie Pie is angry that she has to delay the party too.
<Lucas> *BLINK*
<Lucas> *BLINK*
<HyperMetalLugia> Awesome Ray :>
<HyperMetalLugia> Long term glasses FTW
<Kosoveon> in fact from my last doctor's visit my doctor said i might need glasses
<Rainbow_Claus> So every time you delay EP3, Pinkie gets angry.
<CogWeaver> I thought they said that EP3 wasn't gonna come out and they were gonna make a "new" game mixing the Apeture Science and Black Mesa stories?
<Rainbow_Claus> D:
*Ray brofists HML
<Ihrida> I wore glasses for.... 5 years. Then got contacts and can't go back. xD
<Kosoveon> not that i mind
<Rainbow_Claus> I dunno
<Rainbow_Claus> .
<Joshabaloo> That would be soo awesome :)
<SirSprinkles> 6I want Kel's hat.
<HyperMetalLugia> My glasses are are 2 years old
<Kosoveon> but its a big change from years and years of not needing them
<Rainbow_Claus> The sequel to Ep2 is delayed.
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe 1.5yrs, I forgot already
<Ray> 02mine are over... I can't even remember xD
<Cynder7> 6Hmm
<Ihrida> You forget they're there.
<Vividkinz> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- *kicked*
<HyperMetalLugia> My first pair is bad now, my eyes have gotten even worse from 3 yrs ago XD
<Ihrida> I ruined so many pairs of glasses because I forgot I was wearing them at night....
<Rainbow_Claus> Space huzzah.
<Ihrida> I got into the shower with them on a few times... XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Shame, but my current pair is silver frame with black arms :p
<Ray> 02I have had like 4 or 3 pairs of glasses
*CogWeaver thinks about actually kicking Vividkinz for effect*
<Icy> All three have great multiplayer
<Rainbow_Claus> *Balrog besides the Space Core in space*
<Ihrida> I've had 8.
<CogWeaver> hmm...
<CogWeaver> nah
<Vividkinz> Lawlwhat.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<prince-dari> Despite all the time I spend on the computer my vision is still pretty much perfect.
<NightSeas> 12I've had 0 :D
<HyperMetalLugia> 2 so far, planning to keep it at 2 for another 2-3 years :P
<Ray> 02my eyesight changes often... for the worse ¬¬
<Lucas> Please.
<HyperMetalLugia> EW Nightseas
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<CogWeaver> ?
<Simminz93> Hey y'all

<CogWeaver> sup
<HyperMetalLugia> Glasses are epic, even if you don't need them ;D
<Simminz93> Nm you?
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, that is a nice hat.
<Ihrida> My dad has better than 20/20 vision according to his eye doctor. He's on a computer all the time though, so by the end of the work week, his vision's blurry. xD
<Vividkinz> Noob question: What's the percentage sign next to certain people's username?
<Espeon> 06Good night
<CogWeaver> nnnope
<Kosoveon> night
<HyperMetalLugia> night ;3
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<Ihrida> Night.
<NightSeas> 12Ah, I have 2 pairs of sunglasses
<Icy> Well, honestly mvc3 is my least fav, but it's alright
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> %- half mod
<CogWeaver> It means they're of modship/adminship
<prince-dari> How can you have better than 20/20? I thought 20/20 meant perfect vision?
<Ray> 02Lazor Surgery is even more EPIC
<CogWeaver> yes
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> @- full mod
<NightSeas> 12I just don't have the kind people need
<Vividkinz> Alrighty then.
<Silverscreen> 11Worthy of Michael Jackson. XD
<Ihrida> It is perfect vision, yes.
<HyperMetalLugia> Shoot da whoop on your eyes XD
<Icy> Shrap
<Cynder7> 6TF looks quite cool
<Ihrida> He can see better than people with perfect vision. He can see reeaaaally far in other words. XD
<Baggerboot> Ohay vivid. You're here too?

<Silverscreen> 11o.o
<Baggerboot> The whole Minecraft server is here
<Bazul> lol, yeah
*HyperMetalLugia is nearsighted and farsighted, kinda
<Ihrida> Which is why his vision's blurry from using computers.
<SirSprinkles> 6What?
<Bazul> we can be in two places at once
<HyperMetalLugia> Or just plain astigmatic ;p
<Vividkinz> Yes, I am.
<Silverscreen> 11That sound

<Icy> D:
<Cynder7> 6*icyhug*
<Kosoveon> i got a sega saturn and games for it for like $35
<prince-dari> Sounds like a vista/windows 7 sound.
<Icy> *hugs*
<Kosoveon> and that was from a thrift store where they didn't know any better
<SirSprinkles> 6It is vista
<Cynder7> 6See you tomorrow? :3
<Silverscreen> 11Poor Sprinkles. I know your pain.
<prince-dari> Vista. Lawl. :P
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> *derp*

<Rarity_RP> >=|
<Rarity0> Revolver: Not that.
<Kosoveon> because I heard something about a sequel for the 3DS
<Kosoveon> im not sure if that's just rumor or not
<Rarity0> Revolver: I can live with that. it's like Rarity's a troll.
<Kosoveon> if so then my head would prolly explode XD
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> why the hell would sticking gems on dresses make them awesome??!
<Rarity_RP> I'm not a troll.
<Kosoveon> *not
<Rarity_RP> I'm a pony.
<Rarity0> Revolver: But you TAKE BACK THAT THING YOU SAID ABOUT RD!
<Ihrida> What's TWEWY?
<Kosoveon> the world ends with you
<Ihrida> Oh.
<Rarity0> Revolver: RD IS BEST PONI ALONG WITH AJ.
<Ihrida> I wanted it. never got it.
<Arcesious> what are you watching now?
<Silverscreen> 11I'm gonna go, guys.
<SirSprinkles> 6k Silver
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Kosoveon> it's an awesome game
<Sathia> Nightynight
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm probably leaving after this episode anyway...
<Silverscreen> 11Seeya later.
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Kosoveon> to be honest, i dont know if it NEEDS a sequel, but it'd be cool to see it acknowledged
<Ihrida> I'm poor. D:
<Arcesious> okay ima leave then
<Kosoveon> :<
<Sathia> See you next movie night :)
<Sathia> Ciao
<Sathia> bye.jpg
<Kosoveon> im not exactly rich either
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Trixie = Also Awesome, Twilight = Cute
<Rarity_RP> Gigyas?
<Rarity_RP> Trixie=Fail
<Kosoveon> i had to sell my wii and a bunch of other games to get a 3ds
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Rarity = Fail at life
<Ihrida> I would never sell a system for a system.
<Ihrida> I'd rather save for years.
<Fluttershy_RP> Rarity isn't a fail at life.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Fluttershy - Supercute!
<Fluttershy_RP> Fluttershy is supercute.
<Joshabaloo> agreed
<Ray> 02Btw Kosovo, Get a new Wii, Ike's sword and CP's fist need more blood.
<Kosoveon> and I am
<Fluttershy_RP> But... I'm not... that cute... am I?
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait for the Wii U
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Kosoveon> when I heard the wii u isn't supporting gamecube software
<Ihrida> The new Nintendo console's cominbg out. </3
<Kosoveon> that sealed the deal for me
<Kosoveon> as in getting a new wii
<Kosoveon> still getting a wii u though
<Kosoveon> eventually
<Kosoveon> XD
<Ray> 02yay~
<Ihrida> I hate when Nintendo releases a new system RIGHT AFTER I get the older one.
<Ray> 02Screw the 3DS I'll save for the Wii U
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Yeah of course you are!
<Kosoveon> you DO know the new SSB game is going for both systems :P
<Ray> 02I know, but still
<Ray> 02xD
<Kosoveon> i think I'll go with the 3ds version
<Ray> 02...
<Ihrida> I want a 3DS for OoT. Nothing else.
<Kosoveon> hey
<Ray> 02How do you dare?!
<Kosoveon> i like the portability D:
*Ray pulls his staff
<HyperMetalLugia> Wii U > Wii > 3DS
<Kosoveon> there are a lot of games coming up for it that I am looking forward to
<HyperMetalLugia> Sorry, but yeah
<Ray> 02Nah
<HyperMetalLugia> ;>
<Ihrida> Oh my, I've talked too much on the IRC.
<Kosoveon> most of them no one knows about XD
<Ihrida> Back to lurking.
<Flamerunner> Fluttershy
<Flamerunner> you're cute
<Ray> 02Wii U > 3DS ~ Wii
<Flamerunner> but i still ... uhmm... "like" Derpy.
<Fluttershy_RP> N-no....
<Ray> 02And I killed the chat, I'm awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope
<Kosoveon> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Now go clean your scales
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Kosoveon> HD Zelda <3
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> *blush*
<Ray> 02I haven't played a Zelda game >(
<HyperMetalLugia> Hardcore gamers on a nintendo system <3
<Kosoveon> and honestly I am also getting a wii so I can play skyward sword
<Kosoveon> which is looking more and more awesome to me
<Ihrida> Monster Hunter = <3
<Ray> 02Every time that I get my hands on one, SOMETHING happens to the console and/or the game
<Ray> 02MOSTER HUNTEEEER <333
<Ihrida> I have Tri
<Ray> 02Ihrida, Do you play?
<Ray> 02sidusvkdn
<Kosoveon> monster hunter tri
<Kosoveon> how is it?
<Ray> 02Europe or America?
<Kosoveon> :B
<Ihrida> But I don't have a PSP anyhmore
<Ihrida> SO GOOD.
<Ihrida> America.
<Ray> 02HR?
<HyperMetalLugia> EW PSP
<Ihrida> Uhhhh
<HyperMetalLugia> Kill it :<
<Ihrida> Somewhere between 10 and 20
<Ihrida> Have you played a PSP?
<Ray> 02mine is 14 or 16
<Ray> 02anyway.
<Ray> 02Let's play... now
<HyperMetalLugia> Once, I laughed at how silly it was
<Ihrida> .___.
<Kosoveon> i actually have a psp that I inherited from my dad
<Ihrida> I used to make fun of the PSP
<HyperMetalLugia> CDs, on a handheld
<Kosoveon> i've played like three games for it
<HyperMetalLugia> HAHAHAAAH, no
<Ihrida> Then I got one and sad faced at my ignorance.
<Kosoveon> and have like 11 I got on sale for super cheap XD
<prince-dari> Never had a PSP, but from what I've seen they're the best handheld console.
<Ihrida> Monster Hunter Freedom Unite was life changing
<Ihrida> Now I need a new PSP for 3rd.
<Ray> 02I'm neutral at PSP's, Haven't played one. Won't jugde
<HyperMetalLugia> Pfft, best at being slow XD
<nickstr> I have one
<Ihrida> Pff
<Ihrida> Mine was my fastest cconsole
<Kosoveon> tbh completely honest, DS>>>>PSP
<HyperMetalLugia> PSP GO sucks, and the unhackable ones are terrible
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> ....
<Ihrida> You must have a crap PSP
<Kosoveon> *to be
<Ihrida> Yeah
<Ihrida> Gos are awful
<Ihrida> no UMD drive.
<HyperMetalLugia> AKA most PSPs now :P
<HyperMetalLugia> UMD is terrible anyway
<prince-dari> I have a DS, but to be honest compared with the PSP it seems pretty poor.
<HyperMetalLugia> Like, the disks can get scratched and broken
<Ihrida> If you're an idiot, yes.
<Ihrida> I had a case for UMD's
<Ihrida> XD
<Ray> 02XD
<Ihrida> I still do, actually
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't need a case for my carts :p
<Ihrida> Me either
<Ihrida> And I lsoe them
<Ihrida> Often
<nickstr> its an impressive system for what it does
<HyperMetalLugia> Why waste more money on a case? XD
<Ihrida> And if they get wet, they break
<HyperMetalLugia> Not exactly
<Kosoveon> the psp has its perks, i admit
<Ray> 02I would love to have a PSP (original), but over here they're rare and expensive
<Kosoveon> but when it comes to the sheer volume of the game library
<HyperMetalLugia> I dropped quite a few games...that have dropped in water
<Joshabaloo> boredom :(
<Ihrida> If I want a Nintendo handheld game
<Kosoveon> the ds is the better system
<HyperMetalLugia> They all still work XD
<Ihrida> The DS is the way to go
<Ihrida> If I wanted Final Fantasy or action
<Ihrida> PSP
<HyperMetalLugia> DSi XL is better
<MFW> wtf that was unexpected
<Ray> 02DSlite is the best IMO
<Ihrida> PSP actually ahd about the same am ount of games
<Kosoveon> 3DS is the best :B
*Kosoveon flees
<Ihrida> Most just aren't largely publicised.
<Ihrida> True.
<Ihrida> I can't afford one, though.
<Ihrida> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> If you wanted a decent and cheap touchscreen with tons of games, and BC, get a DSlite :P
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Barry> hi again
<HyperMetalLugia> DSLs are so cheap now, it's greagt
<Ihrida> I never even use the touchscreen.
<prince-dari> Hey.
<HyperMetalLugia> *great
<Kosoveon> $99 I believe
<MFW> Hello
<Kosoveon> new
<CogWeaver> And no, Rarity0, I will not take back what I said about RD
<Ihrida> $99.00 now, yup
<Barry> just decided to check back in
<HyperMetalLugia> Neither do I, but it's still fun to play with :>
<HyperMetalLugia> How much is a PSP?
<CogWeaver> I only said she was "not quite as awesome" in relation to AJ
<Ihrida> About the same price, I believe
<CogWeaver> not that she wasn't awesome herself
<NightSeas> 12Ew PSP
<CogWeaver> but that AJ was still better
<Kosoveon> the game I play most often on my psp is lunar
<Ihrida> I haven't had one for about 6 months
<CogWeaver> AJ is the best pony in the whole canon
<HyperMetalLugia> 130$
<Ihrida> Mine broke
<Kosoveon> that's about it
<CogWeaver> but not the fanon...
<Ihrida> lolol
<Ihrida> Not $130
<Ihrida> Unless you go for Go's
<Ray> 02DSi XL's and Dsi aren't easily hax-able. that's why I still love Dslite. And the funfact is that I have a DSi, lawl
<Ihrida> and Go's suck
<Ray> 02[/late]
<Ihrida> I saw them $120 half a year ago
<HyperMetalLugia> > Not hackable > Slow UMDs > Thumb thingy
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly thing really, and a sorta bad battery life :P
<Ihrida> PSP's are hackable
<Ray> 02PSP, ARE easily haxable
<HyperMetalLugia> Not the new ones
<HyperMetalLugia> Or so I've heard LOL
<Ihrida> Same battery life as DS'
<Ray> 02So true
<Ihrida> UMD's are fast unless your PSP is crap
<Ihrida> And new ones aren't hackable YET
<MFW> lol
<CogWeaver> also, Twilight IS cute...but so are most of them. Twilight = Average
<Ray> 02So is the 3DS
<prince-dari> And the DS isn't easily hackable?
<HyperMetalLugia> UMDs will ALWAYS have loading times
<Ihrida> We already said it was.
<Kosoveon> ^
<Barry> lol, an actual tree
<Ray> 02@Price, it is. But the DSi - DSi XL aren't
<Ihrida> My UMD's loaded über quickly
<Ihrida> It was about 3 seconds
<prince-dari> Everything is easily hackable.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well the DS loads in 0
<HyperMetalLugia> Beat that ;p
<Ihrida> Same load time as a DS cartridge
<prince-dari> You just need good enough people to be bothered to try.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ihrida, don't be silly
<Ray> 02Well, actualy my DSi takes from 3 to 8 secs to load a game
<Ihrida> I'm not being.
<Ihrida> XD
<Ihrida> I actually had both.
<Ihrida> And used them borh
<Ray> 02and that's due I'm playing games with a R4
<Ihrida> Regularly
<HyperMetalLugia> R4s are meh
*CogWeaver speaks like a turret* HellooOOoo?
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm never buying one :P
<Ray> 02(R4 with Wood Firmware ftw)
<Ihrida> My DS Lite
<HyperMetalLugia> (Silly Piracy)
<Ihrida> Actually has a common defect
<Ihrida> It's a white one, and the white ones had a problem with the hinge
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.gamespot.com/features/6159832/under-the-hood-psp-load-times/p-2.html
<Ihrida> The screen doesn't stay up anymore.
<Barry> How is everyone who is still present?
<Ray> 02Same my DSi, My L and R bottoms are almost broke. Most of DSi's L 'n' R Bottoms break =\
<Ihrida> Yet again, My PSP loaded at the same speeds as a DS. XD
<Ihrida> Maybe I just had an awesome one
<HyperMetalLugia> Well you must have a modded one
<Ihrida> I didn't
<Ihrida> I used official firmware
<CogWeaver> where...did everypony go?
<Ihrida> Actually, official firmware was the death of it.
<MFW> gg\
<HyperMetalLugia> What happened?
<eXAKR> What?
<Ihrida> I hadn't charged it in forever
<MFW> just waching
<HyperMetalLugia> See this is why Sony is stupid now
<Ihrida> And I didn't plug it in
<Ihrida> It was updating
<Ihrida> And bam
<Ihrida> XD
<eXAKR> Ew Sony
<Ihrida> My Warranty was done
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Larscis> They went from here to The Outer Limits.
<HyperMetalLugia> Good, it deserved to die :D
<Ihrida> Not really
<eXAKR> Ihrida: what happened?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah really :>
<eXAKR> Boomed?
<Ihrida> My PSP was 10x better than any DS
<Ihrida> And much better games.
<CogWeaver> The Outer Limits?
<Hipster_Brony> I am pretty sure that The Doctor was just outed as a mod on /meta/, but I can't tell if it's trolling
<eXAKR> Sony used to be a good company
<eXAKR> I don't know what happened to them
<Ihrida> they got cheap.
*Fluttershy_RP was just shot
<CogWeaver> ???
<HyperMetalLugia> They failed with the PSP and PS3
<eXAKR> I have an old Sony television set in my room, from >10 years ago
<CogWeaver> Fl-Fluttershy?!?
<eXAKR> Never failed
<Ihrida> The PSP and PS3 are great
<MFW> lol again
<HyperMetalLugia> They tried too hard after the PS2 :P
<Ihrida> Just expensive
<Kosoveon> the psp...eh
<HyperMetalLugia> Ihirda is a sony fanboy *cough*U
<Kosoveon> i mean like
<eXAKR> Only the cable socket got loose and fell out once, but after a repair it was good as new
<Ihrida> Not really. XD
<Kosoveon> like I said, it has its perks
<Kosoveon> and superior graphical power
<Ihrida> I just like good things.
<eXAKR> HyperMetalLugia: maybe
<Kosoveon> the ds has the superior library
<Kosoveon> and that's in the end what matters
<Ihrida> Like I said earlier
<Fuzz> Uhm... hey!
<prince-dari> I don't even like Sony, nor do I have a PSP, but I still prefer it to the DS.
<Ihrida> They have about the same amount of games
<Celestia_Giygas> *Was not the culprit*
<Ihrida> But the PSP's games weren't publicised
<Ihrida> I run across games I never knew came out.
<Unidentified8219> So the My Little Pony Facebook page acknowledged my idea...
<Unidentified8219> Wait...
<Unidentified8219> Hold on.
<Kosoveon> i am very familiar with the psp's better titles
<Ihrida> Sony failed to advertise.
*Fluttershy_RP is dying
<Kosoveon> but the thing is, the good titles on the ds appeal to me a lot more than sony's do
<CogWeaver> what idea?
*CogWeaver revives Fluttershy_RP*
<HyperMetalLugia> The only reason why the PSP sold...was due to the graphics lol
<Ihrida> That's where the entire argument lies, really.
<Ihrida> title appeal.
<Ray> 02You haven't played GoW right?
<Kosoveon> personal taste
<Kosoveon> and for me it's the ds, but I'm not saying the psp doesn't have its fair share of good games
*Fuzz is a useless bystander to these events
<Ihrida> I prefer slightly less childish games, which the DS lacks greatly.
<B-Man> Hust a sec.
<Ihrida> they have a few, but not many that appeal to me.
<Ray> 02That game is the definition of awesome. even though I have only played it like 4 times.
*Fluttershy_RP died
<SirSprinkles> Who knows/cares?
<CogWeaver> *just
<HyperMetalLugia> I perfer slightly less adult/violent/shooter games
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<B-Man> http://www.facebook.com/mylittlepony/posts/233802666637178?ref=notif&notif_t=feed_comment
<CogWeaver> I revived her, though...
<B-Man> That idea.
<Kosoveon> what's "childish" is subjective really
<Ihrida> I personally don't like GoW
<CogWeaver> how did she die?
<Kosoveon> the ds has a LOT of rpgs
<CogWeaver> I revived her!
<Kosoveon> which I like
<Ihrida> I only like a few series of RPG the DS carries
<Ray> 02true, DS RPG's are awesome (Valkyrie Profilee <333)
<HyperMetalLugia> The DS has BC with the GBA :P
<Ihrida> And the Wii lacks practically any RPG's
<MFW> why is it backwards
<HyperMetalLugia> Which has even more RPGs
<Fuzz> Hey, I have a question.
<B-Man> If they make that a real contest, that'll be awesome.
<Kosoveon> that is true
<Ihrida> The GB = <3
<B-Man> Also, there's a rainbow outside my window.
<Ihrida> I have every model of Gameboy though.
<CogWeaver> What is it Fuzz?
<Ihrida> I don't need a DS for Gameboy games, so I don't use it for Gameboy games.
<Kosoveon> the world ends with you is one of the ds's best games
<CogWeaver> Derpy, why are you always changing your nicks?
<B-Man> :/ My chat window is glitching.
<Ghosties> 4I'm too busy paying attention the crap that permeates /oat/
<B-Man> Once sec.
<Kosoveon> but thats the thing...it wasn't publicized enough
<Ray> 02GB <3333 GBC <33333333 GBA <3 GBA:SP </3
<Ihrida> I have Final Fantasy III for the DS
<Aurora> 6I heard so much about that game
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> i get bored....
<Aurora> 6never played it
<Retsamoreh> She's Derpy, I guess.
<Aurora> 6kinda want to lol
<Kosoveon> it's awesome
<rubenflonne> to not do copy write things
<Kosoveon> in every way
<CogWeaver> right right, she's oatmeal
<Fuzz> How do you pronounce "Lyra?" I would assume it's liar-uh, as that's how the instrument's name is pronounced, but I'm tempted to pronounce it leer-uh since it's a name...
<Aurora> 6what was so awesome about it-
<MFW> o
<Aurora> 6k
<MFW> ok then
<MFW> thanks
<Kosoveon> sequel for the 3DS = <3
<Kosoveon> well
<B-Man> But yeah.
<Kosoveon> I could go on forever XDE
<HyperMetalLugia> FF6 3DS plz
<B-Man> I think it'd be a cool contest.
<Kosoveon> -E
<Ray> 02Chrono Cross, I really need to play that game.
<CogWeaver> I pronounce it "Lie-Ruh"
<CogWeaver> idk
<Ihrida> With the way Square is
<Kosoveon> but the story for one is really good, the soundtrack's awesome, and I'm a huge fan of the gameplay
<Free> Pretty sure it's with an "i" sound.
<Kosoveon> many said it was too complicated, but I found it pretty simple
<Ihrida> FF6 will end up PSP only like the FFIV collection. This would irritate me.
<Kosoveon> and I HATE complicated and convoluted rpgs
<Tacowiz> Fairly Oddparents?
<Tacowiz> I loved this show when I was little!
<B-Man> I pronounced it lyra with the short I sound.
<Kosoveon> ff6 needs more love
<Kosoveon> ff4 gets all the attention
<Kosoveon> =/
<Tacowiz> It hasn't aired on Nick regularly since 2006. Ohh, and umm, hi!
<Ihrida> FFIV gets no attention
<MFW> hi
<Ihrida> FFVII and FFX do
<Kosoveon> ff4 got a DS remake
<Barry> It's on Nicktoons Network now
<Kosoveon> and a psp collection
<Kosoveon> and a wii ware sequel
<Ihrida> The DS remake didn't have the sequal.
<MFW> lol grinch
<prince-dari> How do you get outed as a mod anyway? I thought they didn't tell anyone?
<Tacowiz> I doesn't get that channel.
<Ihrida> The PSP collection has all of it.
<Kosoveon> and that is true @ the FFVII thing
<Fooby> I agree with Cog
<Ihrida> I like FFVII
<Ihrida> XD
<Kosoveon> I'm saying that FF4 has more attention
<Ihrida> I don't like X
<Kosoveon> not which version of it is better
<Ihrida> And I don't understand the lack of interest in VIII
<Fuzz> I wonder if I'd ever have any reason to say it out loud anyway. I don't know any bronies IRL.
<Barry> Ah. What about The Hub?
<Tacowiz> This show is super nostalgic for me. I watched it regularly from 2000-2006ish...when it stopped airing regularly.
<Kosoveon> I dislike VIII
<Kosoveon> and VII was very good
<Tacowiz> I watch MLP FiM on YouTube. Duh.
<Ihrida> I've been trying to find a copy of VI Advance for so long. </3
<HyperMetalLugia> FF7..never played
<CogWeaver> I pronounce it like "F-oh-ih-ss-th-ee-b-eh-ss-t-p-oh-n-ee"
<Kosoveon> ff6 advance <3
<HyperMetalLugia> I should download the ISO or get it on Amazon
<Ihrida> I bought a copy on this website and it was fake
<HyperMetalLugia> FF6 SNES > FF6a
<Barry> Spongebob Squarepants still airs regularly on Nickalodeon
<Ihrida> I don't have a SNES
<Ihrida> Veen over this.
<Ihrida> *Been
<Kosoveon> ff6 advance has the better script
<Kosoveon> which I care more about than the music
<Barry> Ah
<Kosoveon> which is still good anyway
<Ihrida> I wish they'd release it on the VC
<Tacowiz> Not only is SBSP nostalgic for me, but I still like i---well, I like seasons 1-3.
<Kosoveon> same
<Ihrida> I'd buy it instantly
<Ihrida> I have I on the VC
<Tacowiz> Come on, Timmy. This is still better than being locked in a box and fed to rabid animals or whatever Vicky used to do.
<Kosoveon> if I still had my wii
<Kosoveon> I'd buy chrono trigger on the VC
<CogWeaver> Chat = DEAD
<Barry> I like to catch Family Game Night on The Hub, too
<Hipster_Brony> it was weird, i think it was just !!RainbowDash trolling
<Thaluka> Gotta go to work, no time to check it out, but just saw some random Pony stuff
<Ihrida> I want it
<Thaluka> http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2011/06/bt-comcast-mr-album/
<Ihrida> My wallet's full of dust.
<CogWeaver> mmmmmmmmmk
*Fuzz attempts to revive chat
<Thaluka> Did this already get posted? I didn't watch the video but it has ponies
<RoyKirbs> ...
<Hipster_Brony> The Doctor was talking about mod communications and wrote "we" instead of "they"
<RoyKirbs> I am dumb. very very dumb.
<Fuzz> Ponies.
<prince-dari> Oh.
<RoyKirbs> So like.
<Hipster_Brony> so people started saying he was secretly a mod
<Fuzz> ...I tried.
<RoyKirbs> I did some kind of RP hours ago and decided to actually log the thing.
<Ihrida> Who was I gonna play Tri wit, again?
<Tacowiz> Wouldn't the right thing be to tell Vicky the truth, that you don't want to be her friend, rather than making her WANT TO KILL YOU?
<Kosoveon> another I'd buy would be bit trip runner
<CogWeaver> mmk
<Hipster_Brony> then !!RainbowDash said "it's OK, you can tell them the truth" after he denied it
<RoyKirbs> ...And put it on a google docs document.
<CogWeaver> m....k
<Kosoveon> but now that a bit trip collection has been annouced for the 3ds I'm content
<Ihrida> I like Bit Trip Fate
<RoyKirbs> This rp involved um...
<Ihrida> I can't afford a 3DS or I'd have no complaints. XD
<Tacowiz> Who heard Skype noises just now?
<RoyKirbs> A bit op processing and handling.
<Kosoveon> XD
<RoyKirbs> *of
<Ihrida> I could get Link's Awakening DX again. <3
<CogWeaver> ...
<SirSprinkles> 6I have my Skype on.
<Kosoveon> which reminds me, i need to download that
<CogWeaver> ?
<RoyKirbs> I'm trying my hardest not to say shipping yet I just did right there.
<Ihrida> Was it Ray?
<Kosoveon> all that's on the GB VC for the 3DS right now is link's awakening DX, super mario land, alleyway, and radar mission i htink
<Fuzz> Oh.
<CogWeaver> k...?
<RoyKirbs> Hurray!
<Ray> 02Nickalert much?
<CogWeaver> so...
<Kosoveon> so far I've downloaded super mario land, and that lasted me like two hours XD
<Fuzz> I figured you meant you had to edit it for language, since this is a PG chat room and all.
<CogWeaver> ...how're you dumb..?
<Ray> 02Oh Chrono Cross.
<RoyKirbs> Now I can't um....
<Tacowiz> I thought Hipster Brony was the stream runner/broadcaster person?
<Ihrida> Ray
<Ray> 02And yes With me (@Ihrida)
<MFW> ponies!
<Ihrida> Were you the one who wanted to play Tri?
<Ihrida> Oh
<Ihrida> Okay
<CogWeaver> ....?
<Ihrida> I just plugged it in
<Ihrida> XD
<RoyKirbs> Because I actually LINKED THIS into the main chat.
<prince-dari> Nah.
<Kosoveon> i wanna play tri eventually
<Tacowiz> He just sat there as Vicky died. Coolio.
<prince-dari> Sprinkles does the Saturday stream.
<Kosoveon> sounds fun from what I've heard :B
<CogWeaver> wait...wut?
<Ray> 02Warning, my WINternetz may stop our plans
<SirSprinkles> 6And last night's stream.
<SirSprinkles> 6But usually it's DCD.
*CogWeaver doesn't follow...*
<Ray> 02(aka: Disconnection every 10 secs)
<Ihrida> I want to get a PS3 just for Monster Hunter 3rd HD
<RoyKirbs> And now I went a couple steps up the creepy ladder.
<Ihrida> I have no other interest in the PS3... xD
<Ihrida> Well
<RoyKirbs> Because I ended up creating shipping between kirby and pegasus.
<Ihrida> The possible re-release of FFVII
<Ihrida> I saw something about that recently
<RoyKirbs> I need a stiff drink.
<HyperMetalLugia> I lost interest in the PS3 when it lost its origional features
<Ihrida> And to play my PSP's old PS1 games
<Tacowiz> Who's DCD?
<SirSprinkles> 6NewDCD
<SirSprinkles> 6He's the usual streamer.
<SirSprinkles> 6Posts in Green.
<Ghosties> 4DCD is our admin
<CogWeaver> ...
<CogWeaver> ...right
<CogWeaver> k then
<Ghosties> 4And usual streamer
<Fuzz> Well, this did give me an idea. 20 questions?
<MFW> woah i remember this
<CogWeaver> nah thanks
<Fuzz> oh. okay.
<CogWeaver> (also, that was a question, so you're down to 19 :P )
<Tacowiz> I remember this so it must be from before Poof was born, as that's when regular reruns stopped, I think.
<Kosoveon> FFVII is actually quite good
<Ihrida> That was all I used my PSP for in its later years
<RoyKirbs> Hahaha
<Kosoveon> i just wish that all the attention it gets could go to ff6
<Ihrida> FFVII, FFVIII, and FFTactics
<Fuzz> Well now I feel like a loser AND I'm down one question.
<Ihrida> I had planned on getting IX
<Fooby> ? ? ? ? ? ?
<CogWeaver> eeyup!
<Fooby> And now you're down six more.
<CogWeaver> mah work here is DONE
<Fooby> /brick'd
<Ihrida> FFVI is the best one... XD
<MFW> yup
*Fluttershy_RP just got banished
<Ihrida> Only problem is
<Ihrida> It came out on the SNES
<J-Lugia> Palkia, Dialga, or Giratina?
<MFW> if im right shes a fairy hunter..
<Ihrida> Giratina
<Kosoveon> giratina
<Aurora> 6palkia
<SirSprinkles> 6She is, IIRC
<Aurora> 6no in all seriousness, giratina
<Aurora> 6i just wanted to be diiferent :>
<Ihrida> I was gonna say bad things about Palkia
<Ihrida> But I thought you were serious
<Fuzz> whooooo
<J-Lugia> ok, 4 Giratina, 1 palkia and one dialga xD
<Kosoveon> is this a survey? XD
*Kosoveon shot
<J-Lugia> not exactly. Doing an even in Soul Silver
<HyperMetalLugia> Gira
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<MFW> lol yup
<Ihrida> I had so many PS1 games on my PSP. I miss it... </3
<Ihrida> lv. 1 Giratina FTW
<Ihrida> :P
<Aurora> 6I love palkia though
<Aurora> 6giratina a bit more
<Ihrida> Rawr?
<Fuzz> lol
<J-Lugia> alright, I'm taking Giratina xD
<Kosoveon> tbh giratina was one of the only gen 4 legendaries that I liked
<Kosoveon> aside from shaymin and darkrai

<drf|laptop> 03Sincerely,

<Ihrida> I liked it because it was just so dark....
<Ihrida> i got an Espeon from that. .___.
<MFW> whats that hand doing there haha
<Quanyails> 7Meep.
<drf|laptop> 03I tried to
<drf|laptop> 03ít didn't work
<Ihrida> the game was fail
<Quanyails> 7Well, at least you got your answer. :)
<Ihrida> I almost threw my laptop over that game.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> http://spikeroll.zxq.net/
<Quanyails> 7Not too bad if you play it normally. Excruciating if you're trying to get one specific eeveelution.
<MFW> Why the hell would she do that?
<Tacowiz> What's her motivation?
<Tacowiz> Crocker wants to harness the power of fairies to rule the world.
<Ihrida> I only have a laptop, so it was excruciating regardless.
<Fluttershy_RP> [20:31:00] Mongoose|Postal2 kills fluttershy
*Fluttershy_RP cries
<Ihrida> I luckily got what I wanted. XD
<Tacowiz> This girl just wants to KILL THEM.
<Mongoose|Postal2> haha
<MFW> ikr^
<Tacowiz> ...What's her motivation to KILL THEM?
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7Everyone wants the Espeon. O_o
*Fluttershy_RP leaves, unloved
<Aurora> 6because espeons <3
<Kosoveon> for obvious reasons
<Kosoveon> :P
<Ihrida> I figured they'd have problems getting everyone their eeveelution.
<Geradex> everyboidy loves fluttershy
<Fuzz> I love fluttershy...
<Tacowiz> She smells magic?
<Ray> 02No love for flareon
<Tacowiz> Does she smell friendship too?
<Retsamoreh> I like Fluttershy.
*Fluttershy_RP is now dead
<MFW> I think shes hardcore
<Aurora> 6flareon is my least favorite
<Quanyails> 7Aw, it's floofy. :P
<Aurora> 6jk, no leafeon is
*Geradex performes CPR
<Quanyails> 7My least would probably be Vaporeon.
<Ihrida> I hated Flareon in Gen I
<Geradex> oh no you don't
<Kosoveon> vaporeon <3
<Ihrida> It carried over.
<Aurora> 6^
<Mongoose|Postal2> She did not love me
<Aurora> 6vaporeon <3
<Quanyails> 7If only it got Flare Blitz. D:
<Mongoose|Postal2> So I shot her in the head.
<Ihrida> I like Vaporeon
<Ihrida> XD
<Aurora> 6...
<Geradex> ...
<Aurora> 6flareon doesn't learn flare blitz?
<Quanyails> 7Nope.avi
<Kosoveon> that was my eeveelution
<Ihrida> It's boss
<Geradex> you monster...
<Tacowiz> CONTINUITY ERROR
<Kosoveon> espeon is cool and all
<Kosoveon> but
<Tacowiz> CONTINUITY ERROR
<Kosoveon> vaporeon <3
<Mongoose|Postal2> She broke my heart
<MFW> I wish i was home
<MFW> gogogo
<Aurora> 6wtf lol
<Aurora> 6flare blitz + flareon's attack
<Geradex> i will make you wish that was all that was broken
<Tacowiz> Jordon Von Strangle is notified when someone finds out about the existence of fairies
<Aurora> 6that should be obvious
<Aurora> 6wth
<Hipster_Brony> 8wow, i really should pay more attention to this chat
<Quanyails> 7Yeeeeeep.
<Tacowiz> Wasn't he notified?
<Quanyails> 7Poor Flareon, still doesn't get any good moves for 5 generations.
<MFW> Oh dang
*Mongoose|Postal2 runs away
<MFW> thats interesting
<Tacowiz> Not only is there an error with a character's motivations, but there's a GIANT continuity error.
*Geradex readies the tranq rifle and fires
<prince-dari> Run down the road, nice.
*Geradex reloads and fires again
<Aurora> 6fire fang is /decent/
<MFW> We should write and angry letter.
<MFW> an*
<MFW> oh dang
<Tacowiz> To Butch?
<eXAKR> http://io9.com/5812836/you-cannot-resist-the-unholy-alliance-of-cars-and-tentacles-in-this-trailer-for-super-hybrid <- What the frak?!?
<Aurora> 6now if flareon was given sp attack instead of attack, that would be a lovely moveset
<Tacowiz> He runs an internet forum.
<MFW> ahahaha
<CogWeaver> I love Fluttershy
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<J-Lugia> the heck, eXAKR!?
<Tacowiz> Oh boy! Racist accent!
*Mongoose|Postal2 hides in a hole
<CogWeaver> even though I like Applejack more
<Quanyails> 7But we've already got two high-Sp. Atk eeveelutions, right?
<Aurora> 6I learn not to question eXAKR's links
<Aurora> 6just laugh
<Mongoose|Postal2> I love all of the mane cast
<Aurora> 6yeah we do, I'm just saying
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Oatmeal?!
*Geradex follows and readies a few smoke bombs
<Geradex> I will flush you out!
<Aurora> 6after all, fire type is one of those primarily sp attack types
<Quanyails> 7I just noticed Flareon's HG/SS sprite is the same pose as the Sugimori art. O_o
<Tacowiz> Can you show an older episode? Like a really early one?
<MFW> Lets see if the next one has some more mistakes.
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Aurora> 6it rarely works as attack
<SirSprinkles> 6I can.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I will.
<Tacowiz> Yay!
<Tacowiz> Thank you!
<prince-dari> I swear the car that kills people is from an old film.
<Ihrida> Sorry if I don't reply, hunting with Ray.

<Tacowiz> He probably stole it.
<SirSprinkles> 6I am.
<Retsamoreh> And what?
<Metal_Link> Do you always stream?
<deliopen> Neat.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not usually.
<MFW> OMG
<MFW> YUSS
<RhettVolikov> oh i love this one
<SirSprinkles> 6It's usually NewDCD
<RainBroDash> Damn you Sprinks and your Skype noises, I keep looking at my skype all excited, thinking I'm popular.
<deliopen> TRON!
<prince-dari> LOL
<Fluttergirl> 0haha
<Barry> Matrix
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I think I'll be doing Saturdays most of the time.
<deliopen> It's def. tron.
<Wierdplatformer> O_O that's what
<prince-dari> Spinkles be trolling with his Skype.
<Nightmare_Moon> And it should be quite simple to take over your dimension. Stopping your nightsky will send all your scientists into a great big mess, panic will ensue in the streets when suddenly there's no sun. Oh sure the green houses will have light enough to grow food but prices will sky rocket
<Barry> That was Tron, but the dodge was Matrix
<Skylands> 10Light!
<deliopen> True.
<SirSprinkles> 6>>; Sprinkleburg...
<Nightmare_Moon> Why, it'll be just like when I was a little foal all over again <3
<RainBroDash> D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<deliopen> lol ponies.
<Metal_Link> >no ponies
<Chimera> 04Sky :D
<Metal_Link> WHY
<Fiddler> did you shake it?
<Skylands> 10Chimew :3
<deliopen> I think he meant MORE ponies.
<Nightmare_Moon> No, I did not.
<SirSprinkles> 6I've played EVERY pony video in the past two days.
<Tacowiz> NO
<Tacowiz> PONIES
<Tacowiz> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<SirSprinkles> 6Most of them multiple times.
<RhettVolikov> yarr
<Fiddler> why?
<Tacowiz> MY MIND CAN'T COMPREHEND
<Wierdplatformer> rejected
<prince-dari> O_o
<RainBroDash> poniesponiesponies
<Soyuz> ohai Newberrytiger
<Tacowiz> NY BRAIN IS GOING TO EXPLODE
<Tacowiz> JUST AT THE VERY THOUGHT
<Retsamoreh> Are you able to sustain a shield capable of holding back intense radiation?
<Dashie|semi-AFK> And then I went to bed.
<prince-dari> That's pretty broad.
<Tacowiz> OF SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE PONIES
<Dashie|semi-AFK> Goodnight people! :)
<Fiddler> night

<RhettVolikov> the hell..
<deliopen> GJ.
*Skylands hugs Light
<Fiddler> i need a hand/hoof shake

<Sprinkleburg> Hi neighbor! :D
<mib_5ljcya> Lol thats amazing...
<RhettVolikov> just gotta troll..
<Fiddler> and i need it from nightmare moon
<Nightmare_Moon> You're gonna nuke me? I find the notion of willingly destroying an eniter region for a single target entirely wasteful
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmHAqgAFt6E&feature=related This makes as much sense as Twilight not reading a book
<Nightmare_Moon> *entire
<Newberrytiger> 14Hello (:
<Fiddler> please?
<Sprinkleburg> its...
<deliopen> At least it's not just the original.
<Flamerunner> hey Nighty
<Retsamoreh> It was a hypothetical question, though.
<BroDashRain> MWAHAHAA
<RainBroDash> O.o
<RainBroDash> XD
<Fiddler> arent you a kind, benign creature?
<RainBroDash> every single time
<Fluttergirl> 0that was amazing
<BroDashRain> xD
<prince-dari> What happens when you try to turn it on?
<Barry> Thank god that's over
<Fiddler> please shake my hand
<Hipster_Brony> 8anyway...
<Wierdplatformer> Flamerunner: It was totally needed
<deliopen> YUS!
<deliopen> This is awesome.
<deliopen> If you haven't seen ti.
<deliopen> *it.
<Nightmare_Moon> Also, the implifactions of launching said nuke will echo throughout all other militaristic systems, giving them the green light to use their nuclear weapons.
<SirSprinkles> 6ATTACK OF THE SKYPE
<prince-dari> Your Skype is so damn busy. O_o
<RainBroDash> bloody sprinkles
<deliopen> lol bloody sprinkles.
<Stormy> It has a dual boot with some netbook OS my friend put on it
<Retsamoreh> So you'll probably be nuked a few times at once.
<Stormy> So it loads the menu to choose an OS
<SirSprinkles> 6Its because we're organizing a Pony D&D group.
<deliopen> Ponycraft next?
<Fiddler> nightmare moon, SHAKE MY HAND
<BroDashRain> selknirps ydoolb
<Stormy> If you select either it will start loading it and then just shut off about 5 seconds in
<RainBroDash> oh, mods, what's our order for next week? is it Ponies -> Ponies -> A Movie -> B Movie (lol B movie, more like bed time)
<SirSprinkles> 6I have one other thing, then ponycraft.
<deliopen> Cool, cool
<Nightmare_Moon> And at the same time, any collateral damage will be blamed on all countries firing causing the world to plunge into a nuclear war.
<Stormy> I can't even get the recovery console
<Stormy> same thing happens
<SirSprinkles> 6It's that, currently.
<RainBroDash> kk ty
<SirSprinkles> 6Subject to change.
<Fiddler> i CLEANED it
<Hipster_Brony> 8rainbro, we may change it
<RainBroDash> hehe
<RainBroDash> ohrly
<Fiddler> PLEASE
<RainBroDash> why is that?
<Retsamoreh> So what happens if we just surrender?
<SirSprinkles> 6We might not want two movies that late.
<Nightmare_Moon> Oh the simplicity of the design leading to such terrible destruction... It's amazing your species has survived as long as it has.
<Hipster_Brony> 8so we dont have 2 movies in a row with no intermission
<Fiddler> my lord, shake my hand
<deliopen> Ah.
<RainBroDash> fair, so moving one ponies between the two?
<deliopen> I seez your point.
*Light_Latias 12can't stop dsjbaksfg.bjs spazzing out @3@
<RainBroDash> that sounds like a great idea
<RainBroDash> tbh
<SirSprinkles> 6Probably, though not definately.
<Hipster_Brony> 8that would be a hell of a grind
*deliopen is trying to think of other good fan-based pony vids.
<Hipster_Brony> 8especially because se7en is a longer movie
<Retsamoreh> That's not an answer.
<prince-dari> No error message or anything? BSOD? It just shuts off?
*Flamerunner shakes Fiddler hand
<Flamerunner> There
<Stormy> There used to be an error message
*Flamerunner goes to clean it
<Fiddler> NOT YOURS
<Stormy> the first time it happened
<RainBroDash> se7en will be sick, I can't miss the stream with all you AmeriBronies
<deliopen> Fan music is pretty good, but not really video.
<Flamerunner> you said "my lord"
<Flamerunner> ... get it?
<RainBroDash> I'll be missing out on another good'un :)
<Fiddler> i need nightmare moon to do it
<Fluttergirl> 0who did this one, its really good!
*Nightmare_Moon sighs grabbing the creature's hand, using the properties of Vaan der val forces giving him a firm hoofshake.
<Flamerunner> Why
<Wierdplatformer> thank you flamerunner
<deliopen> Can't remember, look up Epic Pony AMV 7 Artists, or something like that.
<Fiddler> YAY
<Fiddler> now do it like you mean it
<Fluttergirl> 0okay thanks
<Retsamoreh> You just shook the hoof of our future overlord. Through the internet at least.
<Nightmare_Moon> As to answer your question, the chance of your people backing down is quite small, almost approaching the realm of improbablity.
<Stormy> it's the same thing as this person
<Stormy> http://www.techrepublic.com/forum/questions/101-227361
<deliopen> Np.
<Nightmare_Moon> Humans love to fight in the name of meaningless battle
<Flamerunner> It was my pleasure
<RainBroDash> to be honest I assumed the regular schedule was 'ponies-film-ponies-film', didn't realise that was just how it ended up this week
<Stormy> but after getting that once it never came up again
<Fuzz> While you all were busy with handshakes, I kidnapped Fluttershy.
<Fiddler> Fuzz
<Fiddler> get lost
<Fiddler> no one cares
<Fuzz> D:

<Pinkamina> Heyyou
<deliopen> Haven't seen this one, btw.
<Retsamoreh> Guys, we have bigger problems. Nightmare Moon is dissing our species with completely legitimate reasons.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i still cant get away from moonbase alpha
<deliopen> SNAKE? SNAKE? SAAAAAAAKKEEE
<Fuzz> Wait, Fiddler, were you joking? Or did I just get shunned by love and toleration?
<ZekeS> Retsamoreh: I'd say they're pretty legitimate
<Flamerunner> Hey Nightmare
<SirSprinkles> 6You will never escape it.
<Flamerunner> i found this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNWR4j0aAl0&feature=related
<Fiddler> the chance of an alien enemy attack earth is a great thing
<deliopen> I didn't really get into moonbase, but I tried it. Didn't do multiplayer, probably why.
<prince-dari> "Try booting from the Win XP CD. Select Repair in the menu. This will replace critical files in your Windows XP installation without the loss of your data."
<deliopen> Catchy vid, btw. Name?
<Fiddler> gives humanity the chance to join forces
<Stormy> I don't have an XP CD
<Stormy> I also don't have a CD drive
<IvoryVinyl> Hello.

<prince-dari> AEIOU
<prince-dari> AEIOU
<prince-dari> :P
<Fiddler> ay
<Wierdplatformer> Humanity isn't all bad
<Nightmare_Moon> "You like that? Look at your stupid moon one last time because you'll never see it again!"
<Flamerunner> Humanity is worse than that.
<Rev1> Yes it is.
<Wierdplatformer> They try at least
<SirSprinkles> 6Double Rainbow Syndrome
<deliopen> Ah k.
<Pinkamina> aeiou

<Wierdplatformer> light
<deliopen> kk
<Chimera> 04:B
<prince-dari> I should turn on the text-speech for mIRC again.
<Nightmare_Moon> Wheatly made me laugh, watching the whole thing transpire just a few feet from me was rather entertaining. I waved as he floated away.
<Pinkamina> aeiouaeuiouoiauoeuouaoieuioaueioauoeiuauieoiuaoeuioaueoauoeuia
<Fiddler> the moon is overrated
<Pinkamina> brb
<deliopen> "I'm laughing for real right now"
<Fiddler> too mainstream
<Mongoose> I agree
<Fiddler> i want to see a bad guy from uranus
<Nightmare_Moon> Of course, he called my moon stupid, so... he deserves to die.
<deliopen> Btw, there's text-to-speech for IRC? I have mIRC, I just haven't used it in a while.
<BroDashRain> mother of mercy
<Fuzz> I'd really like an answer.
<Fiddler> WHAT, fuzz?
<Stormy> OK, somehow I got it into safe mode
<Fuzz> What exactly did I do that has you so riled up?
<Light_Latias> 12OoT 3D T-O-M-O-R-R-O-W!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kosoveon> chimera
<Nightmare_Moon> In SA2, Robotnik blows up half the moon.
<Kosoveon> there you go
<Kosoveon> :P
<Stormy> it booted! yes!
<Fiddler> HALF
<prince-dari> My computer started crashing a lot when I had faulty RAM.
<Stormy> no idea what I did
<SirSprinkles> 6inb4 Skype attacks again.
*Light_Latias 12dshjasrnbfsdifk I will be the FIRST in my store to own a copy! >;3
<Stormy> I was thinking of buying new RAM anyway
<Fiddler> fuzz, i have no idea what you are talking of
<deliopen> lol
<prince-dari> deliopen: Yes, there is.
<Wierdplatformer> Didn't he rebuild it though
<prince-dari> mIRC has it built in.
<Ray||MH> 02*cough* Working where you are going to buy the game is cheating
<Retsamoreh> I think you'd like GLaDOS if you got to hang out with her. You both have a tendancy to hate humans. Maybe she could loan you some neurotoxin.
<Light_Latias> 12no its not
<Light_Latias> 12it's a strategy :3
<John316> hi
<Light_Latias> 12besides
<Fiddler> well, just because you have the same interest doesnt mean you will bond over it
<prince-dari> My God, so much Skyp.e
<prince-dari> Skype.*
<Light_Latias> 12I can't play it till tomorrow night ;-;
<Nightmare_Moon> GLaDOS doesn't care much for my moon, or the sun... Truthfully I think she'd be an enemy to both my sister and I
<Fiddler> unless your intersest is ponies
<Retsamoreh> Hi.
<Flamerunner> Nightmare Moon rebuilded the moon
<SirSprinkles> 6My Skype is going CRAZY

<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<deliopen> Just closed it, lemme reopen it.
<Metal_Link> Make yourself busy so it doesn't make that sound
<Fiddler> space is an ILLUSION
<John316> So what are we typing about tonight?
<Nightmare_Moon> Because I'm an all powerful goddess alicorn.
<prince-dari> Someone told me to get Skype.
<deliopen> Skype's great.

<Fuzz> We see Granny Smith aging... but that's about it.
<Stormy> thanks for your help anyway though, dari
<deliopen> DCD: What is that a reference to?
<deliopen> The first image.

<LeTiredDCD> >yfw I host a Kamen Rider marathon, and get away with posting in /oat/ thanks to thos epictures
<Nightmare_Moon> I blame luna for that. I was, afterall, in her body. It's really the same reason why my attempts at stopping them were so pathetic.
<Fiddler> buh bye
<Barry> Hi, DCD
<Stormy> But you still tried
<LeTiredDCD> deliopen
<Soyuz> whats up Newberrytiger
<deliopen> Also, I almost typed LCD instead of DCD. Whoops.
<LeTiredDCD> it's a reference to

<prince-dari> Ok, well no problem.
<Fiddler> WAIT
<Nightmare_Moon> Really, the only dangerous life threatening moment was throwing them off a cliff
<LeTiredDCD> Kamen Rider W
<Fiddler> nightmare moon isnt luna?
<deliopen> Haven't seen it, is it good?
<LeTiredDCD> it indeed is
<Nightmare_Moon> Oh you're new here.

<RainBroDash> every time i come back to the computer there's something epic
<RainBroDash> <3
<Nightmare_Moon> I'm a manifestation of Luna's hate, spite, and jealousy. But otherwise, I retain all of Luna's memories up until the point where we got blasted by the elements of harmony.

<Flamerunner> poor Nightmare Moon
<SirSprinkles> 6Me? Tired? Nonsense.
<RainBroDash> >:3
<Nightmare_Moon> Inside the moon is cold and boring rock, nothing interesting at all.
<Barry> This sounds like a Britney Spears song
<BroDashRain> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7wckYjG_Ts
<Nightmare_Moon> I prefered the surface.
<Retsamoreh> Stupid rock.
<BroDashRain> ,/thread
<SirSprinkles> 6ATTACK OF THE SKYPE
*prince-dari nukes Sprinkles' Skype.
<Fuzz> I can't speak from experience, but isn't the surface cold and boring rock as well?
<Barry> lol
<John316> Did you spend your time moving the rocks to make your image visible from Equestria or was that more of a magical effect?
<Metal_Link> Rarity has more class than the girl who is singing this.
<Nightmare_Moon> A crush on my sister? Please, she banished me to the moon. Would I destroy her now? Probably not, The elements are powerful stuff.
<Retsamoreh> Those were craters, John.
<Nightmare_Moon> The surface may be boring, but the sky was simply beautiful.
<deliopen> :p
<John316> so digging
<Metal_Link> Oh my gawd
<John316> ?
<Metal_Link> I keep opening skype thinking someone messaged me
<deliopen> Me too :p

<Chimera> 04lol
<John316> Well I mean with a 1000 years to dig it could have been planned
<Ascendant> hi
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<drf|laptop> 03me joining is funny now?
<Newberrytiger> 14Oh hey there you are :D
<RainBroDash> curses, sprinkles
<Newberrytiger> 14how's everyone?
<Fuzz> If she could summon meteors, couldn't she blast the moon apart and launch herself back to Equestria? Or even better, destroy Equestria altogether?
<Ascendant> you doing anything is funny
<prince-dari> I did get Skype, but I've never used it.
<Skylands> 10Armageddon, did you get my pastebin from the other day?
*Ascendant hides
<Hipster_Brony> 8good thing i dont have skype, so this isnt throwing me off at all
<Skylands> 10Hi Newberry, long time no talk
<Flamerunner> Why i find Nightmare moon with a mustache attractive?
<Flamerunner> in fact why i find Nightmare Moon attractive?
<Nightmare_Moon> Evil, powerful, manipulative?
<Retsamoreh> All villians have this certain attractiveness about them.
<John316> Maybe celestia kept moving 'the sun' in the way to burn up the metors as they got close
<Fuzz> All attractive traits.
<Newberrytiger> 14Yes, same to you
<Light_Latias> 12Danny~
<RainBroDash> I used to use it back in my WoW days err'day, just sat grinding or PvPing and chattin'. Then I used it intermittently for raiding, but I quit WoW. Only time I've used it recently was to chat to some ponychan peeps who made a skype thread
<Barry> This song uses the F-bomb a bit too much for my liking
<Chimera> 04yes because nobody said anything before your entry, drf
<Armageddon> nope

<Nightmare_Moon> Well technically, I'd need to be banished into the moon to prevent my powers from just wisking me back, it would certainly explain why I wouldn't be able to escape until the alinging of four specific stars some 1000 years later would be my only means of escaping
<NewDCD> we should edit the team america
<RainBroDash> @rubenflonne yeah it makes those long drawn-out conversations a bit easier to do too. those ones which you usually have while doing something else
<NewDCD> vid
<Metal_Link> I watched it with Yaridovich
<Light_Latias> 12depending on how Skyward Sword is, this may only happen one more time ;-;
<NewDCD> and when there's the whole silence during the Books part
<NewDCD> suddenly HUGE OBJECTION OUT OF NOWHERE
<John316> wait, why speculate. NMM, do you have meteor summoning abilities?
<RainBroDash> OBJECTION
<RainBroDash> xD
<deliopen> What's the address for mIRC for Mibbit?
<Nightmare_Moon> For me to have been trapped on the surface would also have to mean I had been weakened to such a point that I was unable to return myself until 1000 years later with the aid of said stars.
<ST_Falcon> So, there's nothing actually on the moon? No ancient ruins of unknown civilizations that existed eons ago?
<Armageddon> ._.

<Newberrytiger> 14I was kinda surprised, but I must've done something right if they liked me :P
<prince-dari> Hipster_Brony: No, it was because there was silence when "Books" are mentioned in the song, as opposed to "Fuck yeah".

<Silverscreen> 11ohhhh, nostalgia.
<Soyuz> Hence Story isn't as good
<Outline> Oh, that's a shame. We'll have to find something else to do with our time.

<Outline> How bored are you talking? Because there are probably plenty of things to do...
<Griggs> Soyuz, I bought DA:O but I pirated the DLC
<Retsamoreh> And sorry, Flame. I'm new to IRC chats and don't know if I should use /me or something else.
<Drake> 04Of course spamming Storm of the Century on the Archdemon is so satisfying

<Griggs> In a bad way
*SilverSonic flees
<SirSprinkles> 6I like some of their stuff, but some of it is horrible.
<Soyuz> Drake; Get Arcanum
<prince-dari> I don't like it when people don't like things JUST because other people like them.
<Ghosties> 4But I don't hate Linkin Park for being "too mainstream." I just think it is bad music
<prince-dari> That makes no sense to me.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's really hit or miss.
<Isukra> 12why does SilverSonic want to own a bird so much
<Light_Latias> brbs
<Soyuz> BU

<Soyuz> Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know ghosties, i dont hate them for that reason

<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont actually hate anything for being too manestream
<Drake> 04Why?

<DuskBright> 0YES!
<Hipster_Brony> 8its just that most people dont like what i do

<Hipster_Brony> 8rubber scootaloo
<Soyuz> with a story that gets you interested
<Ghosties> 4Well, I did think it was because of your hipster status :P
<DuskBright> 0It is a mixture of Lauren Faust awesomeness in one video
<Drake> 04[13:15] <Soyuz> its one of the best RPGs that have existed <-- in your opinion.
<Soyuz> In RPGers oppion
<Drake> 04I'll pass. I'm saving up to get a small HD TV for outside.
<DuskBright> 0YES
*Yoshino 2floats about

<Prime_2> IIRC there's yet another way of causing auto-loop on youtube now from the poster's side, but they still left the old way broken. :x
<John316> I keep repeating it over and over again, RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE~
<Spyrorocks> its not totally updated yet
<Spyrorocks> theres actually 13000 nodes
<Spyrorocks> but its waiting to log them when they come online
<Soyuz> you need only 1.2 GB
<Barry> The Mission Impossible theme
<Spyrorocks> its interesting how popular it is in china
<Ivan2294> The unthinkable has happened.
<Hipster_Brony> 8honestly, i think its silly that anyone could dislike something just because a lot of other people like it
<Soyuz> out of, what, your hundred?
<Retsamoreh> Yea?
<DuskBright> 0mission pinkpossible
<Ivan2294> I like a shipfic
<John316> what? rainbow dash not in style?
<John316> oh
<John316> which
<Ivan2294> Rainbow Dash is always in style
<Barry> Total Drama?
<DuskBright> 0meh, this show.... too much hype
<Soyuz> besides, why don't you just have ME2 for PC?
<DuskBright> 0too many seasons
<Ivan2294> And she is always 20% more in-style than anyone else.
<Drake> 04o-o
<Metal_Link> Round 3.

<Ivan2294> Oh, soaring hearts
<Drake> 04My computer

<Drake> 04and can't run anything
<Soyuz> Well
<Ivan2294> And right now I'm just going WTF
<Soyuz> do you have a mac?
<prince-dari> Don't recognise the theme tune for this show.
<Ivan2294> WHY DO I LIKE A SHIPFIC
<Drake> 04It has difficulty running Spore on it's highest settings.
<John316> http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=xwyIR598a_s
<Drake> 04NO
<Barry> Don't know
<DuskBright> 0ummmm
<DJMidli> Ivan2294 cause shipfics can be just as good as regular fanfics.
<DuskBright> 0captain planet
<Drake> 04well
<Barry> Captain Planet

*John316 could not resist
<Kosoveon> hi yoshino
<Soyuz> Mac-bitch
<Drake> 04But my school gave it to me
<Yoshino> 2hi Kosoveon~
<Soyuz> School-mac bitch?
<Ivan2294> True, but I don't like non-canon relations usually.
<sklar> lame
<Soyuz> Why would your school
<Armageddon> macs suck
<Soyuz> give you a computer?
<Drake> 04I use it for schoolwork and storing my anime, whereas I use my Windows for everything else.
<Outline> It's troubling to think about Ivan, but apparently there are good ship-fics out there.
<Ivan2294> Hell, I was surprised that I like fanfiction at all.
<Soyuz> Macs are only good for internet
<DuskBright> 0and Sir Sprinkles, with the power of skype
<Drake> 04For 'educational purposes'
<Ihrida> I'MA GO
<Ihrida> SEE YA'LL LATAH
<Aristeo> United States - Armed Forces Europe, Middle East - Apo
<Metal_Link> The power is mine!
<Drake> 04Every student in out school gets one.

<Aristeo> From that island south of Nigeria
<prince-dari> WTH
<Barry> Don't know
<sklar> the power of heart and everybody else gets like super powers
<prince-dari> School can afford to give free computers?
<John316> I worry that if I start to reaf fanfic I will have 0 free time
<Soyuz> in Australia
<John316> *read
<DuskBright> 0worst. power. ever.
<Drake> 04Not free
<sklar> right
<Drake> 04we have to pay in our school fees
<Ivan2294> John316 there are many better uses for youtuberepeat
<{SV}Matt> Australia always gives out computers
<Retsamoreh> You run out of it eventually.
<{SV}Matt> :O
<Armageddon> well
<Ivan2294> And also, don't worry.
<DuskBright> 0uhhhh...
<DuskBright> 0speed racer !
<Outline> Oh don't worry about that John... you can stop when there aren't any more fics to read ;)
<Drake> 04Once we finished year 10, we get to keep ou laptops.
<Armageddon> we have the free but shit
<Armageddon> government laptops
<Retsamoreh> Then it's just desperatly waiting for the incomplete ones to update.
<Ivan2294> If you are super picky like me you'll rarely ever read any
<John316> ahaha
<Metal_Link> Speed Racer!
<Mongoose|Postal2> Open the door
<prince-dari> We just don't get computers, lawl.
<Soyuz> Drake; and you're in..?
<Fluttergirl> 0easy one there :D
<Mongoose|Postal2> get on the floor

<John316> what fanfics are a must read?
<Soyuz> no fucking wonder
<Emmi> ohai Aristeo
<Aristeo> Emmi!
<Ivan2294> Progress: Luna
<Soyuz> private schools are shit for their computers
<DuskBright> 0I actually figured out before they said speed racer, but they said it before i posted...
<Newberrytiger> 14wow. Our school doesn't care if we have computers or not.
<Ivan2294> Or whatever the correct title is
<Drake> 04I've had this thing for 4 years
<Ivan2294> Friendship is....
<Metal_Link> I wonder how light pegasus has to be to walk on clouds
<Drake> 04And it still works and has 33GB left.
<Retsamoreh> Luna vs X is the common term
<JackiePie> Hi
<Barry> Power Rangers
<Ivan2294> That's also a good one
<Retsamoreh> But official is Progress.
<Soyuz> You are a poor computer guy
<Barry> Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
<DuskBright> 0oh hey, there was a kid and a monkey in your trunk i'm sure they're alri-- OH SWEET MOTHER OF GOD!
<Soyuz> what GB did it originally have?
<Retsamoreh> I greatly enjoyed Paradise.
<Newberrytiger> 14They dont even care if we live in a cave with no technology.
<Metal_Link> SHUT UP
<DuskBright> 0...
<sklar> shit
<prince-dari> Serious shit.
<Soyuz> I have 217 GBs left
<Ivan2294> Also, if you want something that's good, but does not tamper with canon-content too much
<Drake> 04I dunno
<Outline> Mongoose. Fallout: Equestria. Do it.
<DuskBright> 0MARTY!
<Ivan2294> Lower Deck Chronicles
<Drake> 04Based on what I have in my laptop atm, I'd say around 50-60GB
<Prime_2> The first one, at least. The lack of set description and character action during dialogue is less noticeable in the first Progress one
<Soyuz> and I have a VISTA
<DuskBright> 0 1.21 GIGAWATTS!
<Metal_Link> Kaboom!
<Soyuz> now I'm superior to you
<Mongoose|Postal2> Alright
<sklar> t-sar

<Soyuz> an HP Vista
<Barry> KABEWM!
<Mongoose|Postal2> I have meaning to read

<Mongoose|Postal2> it
<Drake> 04...since when did I care?
<prince-dari> LOL VISTA
<Drake> 04I have a computer. It works. I am happy.
<Metal_Link> Speaking of Back to the Future... WHERES MY EPISODE 5 TELLTALE?!
<Prime_2> It's short, sweet, and funny.
<DuskBright> 0derpy standby oh my god that's great
<Soyuz> False happiness
<Soyuz> You can't have ME2 for PC :P
<Drake> 04ok
<{SV}Matt> rofl
<{SV}Matt> I have vista too
<{SV}Matt> I upgraded to 7
<{SV}Matt> then went back
<{SV}Matt> .-.
<Drake> 04I really don't care about having it for PC.
<Soyuz> Why'd you go back?
<Drake> 04I have it on 360.
<John316> oop, laptop battery dieing. g2g
<prince-dari> For my computer I stuck with XP.
<Ivan2294> bye
<sklar> dat flank
<Soyuz> don't those things have a ring of death?
<Outline> Seriously though; just scan the archives. Most of the stuff on EqD is of decent quality, the 5 stars are a good read, and the 6s are pure gold.
<{SV}Matt> Noo
<prince-dari> Got Vista on another computer, it's stupid.
<{SV}Matt> No*
<Ivan2294> Youtuberepeat should be used for good, not evil
<sklar> all alone
<{SV}Matt> Soyuz
<Ivan2294> Like so: http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=CguoLKFKILU
<{SV}Matt> people always assume that
<Mechlord> luna's goodwill tour is likely my favourite, but unfinished
<HyperMetalLugia> OHQI
<{SV}Matt> but, the ring of death
<Mechlord> ir really is excellent
<sklar> soooooooooo alone
<HyperMetalLugia> ohai :3
<{SV}Matt> was mainly that first and second batch of xboxs
<Outline> Is Goodwill tour still updating?
<DuskBright> 0wait a second... do I hear sonic music in the background? or is that me going crazy?
<{SV}Matt> after that
<Soyuz> and now they all fwee of it?
<{SV}Matt> the xboxs were fine
<{SV}Matt> The majority of them
<Ivan2294> I'm sure they're all good, but I prefer to keep MLP as MLP-ish as possible
<{SV}Matt> of course theres always defects
<Soyuz> But I hayed how PS3s can't play PS2 games anymore
<Soyuz> *hated
<{SV}Matt> ik
<Prime_2> hrm.
<Yoshino> 2OHQI? o3o
<{SV}Matt> I don't get that either
<Soyuz> now I can't even play Hitman
<{SV}Matt> I have to buy a ps3 sadly
<Retsamoreh> Well then you'll hate Paradise.
<Ivan2294> So stuff like Fallout or Junior Speedsters Forever feel kinda out of place
<{SV}Matt> ;-;
<Soyuz> hey just free
<Yoshino> 2and hi HML~
<{SV}Matt> cuz
<{SV}Matt> Sly 4
<DuskBright> 0oh god
<sklar> nazi
<Prime_2> lemme find the ones I like real quick
<Soyuz> Get sly 1-3
<prince-dari> I still have my PS2.
<{SV}Matt> I have them
<prince-dari> (:
<Soyuz> Good
<{SV}Matt> Played them all
<Mechlord> I think goodwill is, there has just been a long delay
<Soyuz> you are worthy
<sklar> dammit dash
<Prime_2> oooh, paradise was that "it's a dream" one, right?
<Ivan2294> Trust me, I can get into ANY story and be hooked instantly
<{SV}Matt> except for the first
<DuskBright> 0the fact that I'm jewish makes me thank Rainbow dash right now
<Soyuz> of Sly 4
<{SV}Matt> well
<Soyuz> WHAT
<{SV}Matt> I have the first
<Ivan2294> That's why I rarely ever test stories
<{SV}Matt> I don't like it
<{SV}Matt> really
<Barry> And Pinkie Pie
<DuskBright> 0yep
<Ivan2294> To see if I like them
<Soyuz> It was sloppy
<Barry> and Fluttershy
<Soyuz> and animation poor
<DuskBright> 0hold on
<Soyuz> but hey, it got better
<{SV}Matt> 2nd and 3rd were awesome
<DuskBright> 0there we go
<Prime_2> hm.
<Soyuz> 2nd was its height
<Outline> I can understand that Ivan...
<Leafeon> hay guize
<Soyuz> 3rd..eh
<DuskBright> 0bunny census
<{SV}Matt> 3rd was short
<Barry> And maybe even Mayor Mare
<Soyuz> it also seemed forced
<Yoshino> 2hi Leafeon~
<Mechlord> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/story-lunas-goodwill-tour.html#c3126421040577814327
<Ivan2294> Hell, once my Middle School Librarian gave me a completely random book about an owl or something, and I read it allday
<Soyuz> why is the panda a good guy?
<Barry> yep
<Soyuz> he was a villain in the first one
<DuskBright> 0.... bunnies reproduce at such a rate that they pretty much multiply
<Barry> Indeed
<Ivan2294> And that movie Legend of the Guardians: The owls of Ga'hoole
<Leafeon> i'm at the great wolf lodge and i swear this place should be marketed to furries :V
<Retsamoreh> My middle school teacher gave me a bunch of random romance novels.
<{SV}Matt> lol
<{SV}Matt> I want to know what happens in sly 4 though
<prince-dari> Was expecting the song.
<DuskBright> 0this is me at a sporting event
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<{SV}Matt> after sly lost his memory
<Ivan2294> I heard there was a book, and next thing I knew I had read all 15 books of the series
<{SV}Matt> I was like
<sklar> oh shit
<Barry> lol
<DuskBright> 0except for that part
<{SV}Matt> They can't finish the series like that
<{SV}Matt> :O
<Soyuz> the first trailer just made me think
<Soyuz> cock block
<Soyuz> just like Skyrim's
<Soyuz> it pumps you up
<Soyuz> but ultimately, it's a cock block
<DuskBright> 0brony hitler is top reccomended
<Soyuz> before the real thing
<Ivan2294> I'm surprised I haven't started reading my other 2 Clancy books I have yet to read
<ST_Falcon> OWLS
<SirSprinkles> 6Skype wins
<Prime_2> My standards are too damn high. Most of the time I either don't like it, or it's good enough for me to give it a shot but reader fatigue sets in a little while later. I've got maybe 4 or 5 fics that I really like, and that's it. :E
<ST_Falcon> http://hungoverowls.tumblr.com/
<sklar> Jose Gonzalez is a good musician
<Barry> Buffering
<prince-dari> Skype is eating your bandwidth.
<prince-dari> :P
<DuskBright> 0dangus internet. stop failing
<Ivan2294> ...
<Ivan2294> nah
<SirSprinkles> 6Apparently
<prince-dari> STFU SKYPE!
<iloveponies> ahhhh, managed to watch 22 episodes of MLP with my friend, that should turn him brony in no time
<DuskBright> 0this may or may not be skype's fault... it can screw up internet connection
<{SV}Matt> for me though
<DuskBright> 0in some cases
<{SV}Matt> I can't wait for SSB4
<{SV}Matt> Luigi's Mansion 2
<Barry> That circle is Youtube buffering the video
<{SV}Matt> and....
<{SV}Matt> Pikmin 3
<Ivan2294> Space oddsey is pretty sweet.
<DuskBright> 0I know...
<Ivan2294> *oddyessey?
<Ivan2294> IDK HOW TO SPELL IT
<DuskBright> 0but Skype can do horrible things to internet connection
<Soyuz> Why is Luigi's mansion getting a sequel?
<Prime_2> There are so few fics out there with good set description and physical character interaction/description during dialogue. x_x
<{SV}Matt> idk
<eXAKR> oO
<{SV}Matt> It's going to be for the 3ds
<{SV}Matt> It looks win
<DuskBright> 0uhhhh...
<eXAKR> Needs... something
<Prime_2> MLP isn't a show about talking heads; ponies do stuff when they talk.
<eXAKR> Reshiram?
<eXAKR> Lugia?
<eXAKR> Fluttershy?
<eXAKR> Christine?
<Retsamoreh> odyssey*
<eXAKR> Halsemon?
<Ivan2294> So, has anyone done Ghost Recon ponies in the few hours I've been gone?
<eXAKR> Toripter?
<DuskBright> 0come on random knowledge of random things... you can figure this out
<Ivan2294> Thanks Retsamoreh
<Leafeon> >3ds
<Barry> Indeed... what is this?
*eXAKR throws all of them in
<SirSprinkles> 6Great Mouse Detective
<Leafeon> this is the part where i begin crying
<Retsamoreh> No problemo.
<DuskBright> 0I knew that I could put this to a mouse singing it
<eXAKR> !chimera !isukra !leafeon
*Leafeon still belongs to eXAKR for 10 more minutes
*Isukra now belongs to eXAKR for 7 minutes
*Chimera now belongs to eXAKR for 14 minutes
<Ivan2294> Super Meat Boy ponies?
<Barry> oh, no wonder I didn't recognize it. I never say The Great Mouse Together
<Ivan2294> Dr. Foal
<Soyuz> Stop crying D<
<Leafeon> wait what..

<{SV}Matt> lol
<Leafeon> i thought i turned that off
<Leafeon> :V

<eXAKR> Oo
<Ivan2294> Also, FYI Meat Boy is a boy without skin, so Meat Boy pony can work
<Outline> Huzzah Super Meat Boy.

<Retsamoreh> Ponies have not yet been crossed over with everything.
<Ivan2294> SALT FACTORIES ARMED WITH AUTOMATICALLY-TARGETTING MISSILE TURRETS
<Ivan2294> IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
<Ivan2294> We need to ponify everything
<DuskBright> 0link it when finished!!! this sounds amazing!
<Ivan2294> But lets make sure to get Madagascar first.
<Mongoose|Postal2> Metal gear ponies

<Ivan2294> Not good enough
<Prime_2> wing kirby

<Ivan2294> AND MAKE IT WORK
<Prime_2> pony hat
<Ivan2294> Not. good. enough.
<sklar> i don't know
<Prime_2> pony yarn kirby
<Prime_2> BAM
<Ivan2294> Although I would pay money to see that.
<Squeak> Darn
<Outline> Kirby can be ponified... just get him to eat a pony.
<DuskBright> 0*shrugs* It would be nice to have a brony conversation without having to reload pages on ponychan
<Ivan2294> But he'll just gain the abilities and a hat
<Ivan2294> Not become one
<Squeak> ......That's vaugly scary to think about.
<Outline> Hmm.
<Mongoose|Postal2> M
<Mongoose|Postal2> K

<DuskBright> 0but yeah, what movies?
<Leafeon> hey peets
<sklar> yeah it sure was

<DuskBright> 0.....
<DuskBright> 0excuse me while I go bash my head in with a sink faucet for missing that
<Retsamoreh> He could like, punch a sheep.
<Fluttergirl> 0i missed it too :(

<Ivan2294> Microsoft is milking the eff out of that series now
<Retsamoreh> So who would represent Masterchief?
<RainBroDash> I was hypothesising
<Ivan2294> mastercheif duh
<prince-dari> What in the song did they object to?
<prince-dari> Or what symbols?
<SirSprinkles> 6I wouldn't want you to.
<Ivan2294> only ponifyd
<RainBroDash> but I do have a bit of spare money, come to think of it..
<Outline> Any pony with a helmet, I guess.

<SirSprinkles> 6Besides, things are only going to get worse soon anyway.
<Armageddon> ?
<Ivan2294> Okay Ponify this: Conflict: Desert Storm
<DuskBright> 0I have not only that, but the fact that I'm a minor to deal with when trying to get a job, thank celestia I turn 18 in 4 days 15 minutes.
<RainBroDash> You're not on your own. Bronies got yo' back dude
<Prime_2> <Ivan2294> Some stuff just CANNOT be ponified: Kirby, Yoshi, Steve from Minecraft. <-also, challenge completed http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/5041/ponshi.png
<Light_Latias> the censored version feels empty to me
<Chimera> 04Oh FAIL

<Ivan2294> Only Yoshi?
<PsychicKid> GYPSIES
<RainBroDash> Dusk! If I don't speak to you before then, have a great birthday dude
<Ivan2294> And paper mario at that.
<Flamerunner> Ponify This:
<DuskBright> 0Yeah, at least you have plenty of people willing to help
<Light_Latias> and they changed the symbol on the blocks you can push and I THINK the Mirror Shield
<Ivan2294> Closeenough.jpg
<Flamerunner> F.E.A.R.
<Nightmare_Moon> But god damn if 343 studios CAN'T one up bungie on the explosive warhog sequence at the end (demanded by every halo game) then they're not allowed to develope anymore halo games
<SirSprinkles> 6My family is getting evicted in a little over a month. It's going to be so fun. >>;
<Chimera> 04wtf
<Chimera> 04so those changes are going to be in the 3DS
<Chimera> 04:/
<Ivan2294> Okay let's see
<RainBroDash> Ah, sux dude. We've had the bastards calling trying to kick us out for months
<DuskBright> 0oh... oh god...
<sketch> Mario I bet you could.. but not the aformetioned Yoshi, Kirby, etc
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 Chimera tries to do ROM hacking
<Retsamoreh> Nightmare, you seem to be an awfully big fan of Halo. May I ask why?
<Chimera> 04inb4no?
<Nightmare_Moon> I love the warthog sequence at the end of the games ;.=.;
<RainBroDash> I do my best to empathise, when really I only feel a fraction of your pain dude :( <3
<Ivan2294> So fear stands for First Encounter Assault Recon
<Flamerunner> Ponify F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon)
<Nightmare_Moon> Those were great, awesome music to accompany then too
<RainBroDash> shit will get better someday, right? hehe
<sklar> oh just one last thing i don't think i will be able to make it next week
<Chimera> 04I could care less as long as the game plays the same way as it should >.>;
<Ivan2294> How to ponify that

<RainBroDash> bloody sklar, why not? :P
<Flamerunner> wait
<Flamerunner> How you know FEAR?
<Ali1017> MAGIC
<DuskBright> 0:(
<SirSprinkles> 6I have no real worries about things. What doesn't kill me, etc.
<prince-dari> Lawl, it does sound like chanting though.
<Ivan2294> I looked it up, but I know it stood for something
<Ivan2294> Loved the 2nd game
<Ivan2294> Just forgot what
<Metal_Link> Is the stream offline?
<Necromas> what can I use to play a .swf file that lets me select an audio output device?
<Outline> Bleagh. FEAR wasn't all that good a game.
<sklar> be at my dads but i love him more than any movie
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<Nightmare_Moon> First Equine Assault Recon
<DSD> 4Final Elite enemy
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm leaving in a minute.
<Ivan2294> Well, you know. First horror game
<Flamerunner> Outline
<Metal_Link> Aww, oh well.
<DSD> 4Fury mode on it!!!
<sketch> I remember the hype about it, never played it though
<Flamerunner> SHUT YOUR MOUTH
<prince-dari> However I don't see how it's offensive.
<RainBroDash> i get you sklar, if I could choose to see my dad instead of being in the stream I would xD
<Flamerunner> Nightmare Moon, that's a win.
<RainBroDash> you're forgiven
<Ivan2294> Okay
<RainBroDash> ;D
<Outline> Hey, calling it like I saw it. Did not match the hype.
<Icy> Yooooo
<Ivan2294> How about Tom Clancy HAWX
<PsychicKid> guys i'm tired
<Ivan2294> That also stands for something
<PsychicKid> can i snuggle twilight
<Light_Latias> others did >_>
<Ivan2294> I forgot what though
<Light_Latias> and Chime
<Flamerunner> Google
<Flamerunner> is your friend
<Light_Latias> I would be suprised if it WASNT edited
<Ghosties> 4Well it's nice that people are worried about you bro, and it's nice to see people care
<sklar> alright bye also sklar is pretty much my user name everywhere so if you see it somewhere else chances are its me
<Ivan2294> high altitude warfare experimental (squadron)
<RainBroDash> anyway, gonna grab a drink and shtuff. if you're gone before I get back, peace out Sprinkles, see you later
<Ivan2294> HAWX Squadron
<Ivan2294> Ponify that
<sklar> also thanks for love bye love you all
<DuskBright> 0okay sprinkles... try and see if you can figure a way to get money... I'm sure there's a place where you can work somewhere....
<Games4me> greetings, all
<Ivan2294> High Altitude Warmare Experimental Squadron?
<Ivan2294> Or is that too little
<Ivan2294> Also, Ponify BATTLEFIELD 3
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Flamerunner> Modern Warfare = Modern Warmare
<Flamerunner> i don't see the little
<prince-dari> Hmm, I wonder if I could set up a system where you request videos and then they get streamed automatically.
<SirSprinkles> 6Mane problem really is the lack of ways to contact me. No money = no phone, and that's all any place bothers to do when contacting people.
<Flamerunner> Battlefriends 3
<Flamerunner> wait.
<prince-dari> If I can work out how to make browser addons, probably. :o
<Flamerunner> that sounds stupid.
<Ivan2294> too little ponies
<Games4me> i think that's kinda the point
<SirSprinkles> 6dari: probably not a good idea
<Outline> Cattlefield 3. It's a herding sim for AppleJack.
<Ivan2294> As in not enough pony
<Ghosties> 4Ever considered getting a PO Box, Sprinks?
<prince-dari> Why?
<SirSprinkles> 6They wouldn't send me mail anyway, Ghosties.
<Retsamoreh> Lol, Applejack playing farmville.
<Flamerunner> DOOM 3
<Flamerunner> Ponify it.
<Metal_Link> So no one else is going to stream?
<Ivan2294> Battlefield 3 is gonna be SO AWESOME
<prince-dari> Well DCD could if he gets back.
<Games4me> not much in doom to work with
<Ivan2294> Rainbow dash will explode from the awesomeness
<DSD> 4Hm hes a hard one
<SirSprinkles> 6And because we'd have to set it up so the mods would have to approve the videos so we don't get the same video a million times/inappropriate videos, dari.
<Ivan2294> Even she cannot handle it
<Ivan2294> YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
<Metal_Link> I remember when I used to stream.
<Chimera> 04Muslim fundies probably went "It sounds like us praising Allah REMOVE IT."
<Games4me> OH
<Games4me> BOOM 3
<Games4me> ie sonic rainboom
<DSD> 4And then he died
<Nightboomfer> What up, party ponies?
<Ivan2294> Apple BOOM 3
<DSD> 4All of them dead
<Outline> No. Can't do that. Doom and Ponies just don't mix.
<Ivan2294> (Apple) Bloom 3
<Ghosties> 4Will this mean that you won't be able to mod and stream much longer, man?
<Ivan2294> Red Faction
<Outline> Even trying makes my brain recoil in horror.
<Games4me> hey mine worked!
<Ivan2294> DO IT
<Icy> Dead id good
<prince-dari> Inappropriate videos on youtube?
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, no, I'll be fine.
<Nightboomfer> Maybe if you have them shooting friendship beams instead of bullets
<Retsamoreh> One time, in a lucid dream, I spawned a bunch of locusts and made them eat an entire town's residents alive.
<SirSprinkles> 6I use a cafe wifi, remember?
<Games4me> Red Apple?
<Retsamoreh> It was glorious.
<Sprinkleberg> :D
<Ivan2294> ...
<Nightboomfer> "I need a hug... a really, big hug!"
<Games4me> we all do
<SirSprinkles> 6I mean things we just generally don't want, dari.
<Ivan2294> I hope you never gain the powers to do that in RL retsa
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Outline> Geez retsa... your imagination is a disturbing place...
<Nightboomfer> I was quoting Doom
<Ivan2294> Command and Conquer
<Retsamoreh> Really? You guys must have really boring dreams.
<Light_Latias> no kidding
<Ivan2294> Also, the subtitles Tiberium Sun, Tiberium Dawn, and Red Alert
<Outline> Nightboomfer... you can't quote Doom. There's no dialogue there.
<Games4me> No, just less horrifying dreams.
<Nightboomfer> The Doom Comic I mean
<Retsamoreh> It wasn't that horrifying.
<Outline> Ahh.
<ST_Falcon> YOU ARE HUGE
<Ivan2294> Ponify C&C
<SilverSonic> x.x
<Games4me> Retsa is an awful person.
<Ivan2294> And quake
<Retsamoreh> In all honesty, I'm more afraid of washing machines than I am of giant hordes of locusts.
<DSD> 4I love wind
<Ivan2294> And Starcraft and Need for Speed and Burnout
<SirSprinkles> 6>>; /oat/ needs to move a bit faster so I can leave.
<DSD> 4Fun to knock everything off the edge
<eXAKR> Omnious chanting != Muslim prayers
<prince-dari> I'm not surprised though, and whoever made the song shouldn't be either.
<Icy> Me too
<Nightboomfer> YOU ARE HUGE, THAT MEANS YOU NEED A HUGE HUG! HUG AND CUDDLE... HUG AND CUDDLE... Here comes the Night Pony, choo cha cha BOOGIE!
<Ivan2294> And World of Warcraft, E.V.E. Online
<eXAKR> Muslim Prayers != Evil
<Games4me> I'm sincerely scared for my life right now.
<Retsamoreh> May I ask why?
<Outline> Lol Night.
<Yoshino> 2LOL
<Games4me> It's called a joke.
<prince-dari> People will complain about pretty much anything you do now.
<Outline> You're making my think of Pinkie on a sugar rush with that.
<eXAKR> Being in a country with a sizable Muslim population and receiving channels from a Muslim country, I have heard and see those a lot of times
<eXAKR> And I know what they mean, more or less
<eXAKR> NOTHING EVIL.
<Ivan2294> Ponify Portal
<Games4me> Pinkie is always on a sugar rush.
<Retsamoreh> Portal alraedy has been
<eXAKR> Unless you are those "MUSLIM is EVUL! ALLAH is THE DEVIL!" types
<DSD> 4 2 mana gems 2 armor and 9 Xp gems
<Retsamoreh> See "Better living through science and ponies"
<Ivan2294> Half-life, Counter Strike, TF2, and Day of Defeat
*eXAKR hides\
<DSD> 4Thats all i need
<ST_Falcon> THE TERROR OF THE BLACK HISTORY...
<Ivan2294> The name
<ST_Falcon> IN ORDER TO PROTECT OURSELVES, WE MUST INVITE ARMAGEDDON.
<prince-dari> Lol at Allah is the devil. XD

<Ivan2294> And the others>
<Leafeon> allah is the devil is literally saying god is the devil lopl
<Ivan2294> *?
<eXAKR> Seriously, people are getting too sensitive.
<Flamerunner> Day of Banish, lol fail
<eXAKR> Yeah, Leafeon
<Retsamoreh> Half-pony, Counter Spike, Day of... Pony...?
<Rainbow_Claus> Okay, I'm back for like, four minutes.
<drf|laptop> 03people ARE too sensitive
<Games4me> Day of Banishment
<eXAKR> Basically, Allh is Arabic for God
<drf|laptop> 03it's like when people get butthurt over me saying I don't lik eApple
*drf|laptop hides
<Ivan2294> Closeenough.jp
<eXAKR> *Allah
<Nightboomfer> "Hey Rainbow Dash, I found this neat sugar, it was all wrapped up in this nifty plastic bag and everything! It tastes funny but it makes me soooooo happy!" *snort* OOh, I got a nosebleed!
<Mongoose|Postal2> Pony Effect
*eXAKR smacks drf|laptop with an iPad
<Rainbow_Claus> :l
<Retsamoreh> :l
<Ivan2294> Okay So how about Command and Conquer?
<Rainbow_Claus> Wait, where?
<prince-dari> So you don't care when people say that Weird Al sucks?
<Ivan2294> And ponify Starcraft and Warcraft
<Games4me> I shudder at the thought of ponies on crack.
<Ivan2294> As different names
<Rainbow_Claus> Oh good god, another dimension.
<ZAquanimus> ahh finally, i found the right chatroom
<Retsamoreh> Pinkie Pie in the streets of NYC.
<Nightmare_Moon> Pinkie Pie on cocaine... reality would collapse
<Ivan2294> Ponify C&C
<Rainbow_Claus> Pinkie Pie on crack would ensue not only the destruction of our world, but the creation of an entire DIMENSION.
<Outline> Don't be silly Games4me. Animated characters are hard-wired to avoid drugs.
<Ivan2294> OH I KNOW, PONIFY X-COM
<Rainbow_Claus> OUR
<Rainbow_Claus> DIMENSION.
<Ivan2294> is doomed?
<Games4me> Not all of them.
<Rainbow_Claus> X-COM!
<Rainbow_Claus> YEAH!
<SilverSonic> <%drf|laptop> it's like when people get butthurt over me saying I don't lik eApple <--- pretty much all of us dont like apple :P
<Retsamoreh> A pony dimension?
<Outline> Any time they even see the things, they're forced to come to gether in a nonsensical PSA to denounce the things.
<Games4me> Only the ones made for kids.
<Nightboomfer> You know that Kirby power when he eats a sparkly lollipop and the theme music gets like twice as fast? Yeah, that's what I think of when I imagine Pinkie on coke
<Rainbow_Claus> No, our dimension.
<Ivan2294> X-Com: UFO Defense PONIFY THAT
<prince-dari> I just get fed up with you saying it all the time.
<Light_Latias> lolz
<Retsamoreh> Woops, brb
<prince-dari> At least 5 times every single day "EWW APPLE".
<Light_Latias> also
<Rainbow_Claus> Ivan, I'll do it.
*Light_Latias sits on eXAKR
<Ivan2294> Jsut the name
<Rainbow_Claus> I LOVE that game.
<Nightboomfer> And if Cartoon characters avoid drugs, explain Michaelangelo from the Ninja Turtles
*SilverSonic Sits on LL
<SilverSonic> .-.
<Ivan2294> lol, I've never seen that show
<Ivan2294> _^
*Chimera sits on LL as well :3
<Rainbow_Claus> P-Com: UFP Party.
*SilverSonic puts Chimera on top
<Ivan2294> UFP stands for?
<Rainbow_Claus> Unidentified flying Pinkie.
<Chimera> 04nyaa
<SilverSonic> TOTEM POLE
<Games4me> Know what? PONIFY TETRIS.
<Ivan2294> a Flying Pinkie Party?
<Chimera> 04XD
<Ivan2294> WE ARE DOOMED
<Outline> How could it be unidentified, AND known to be pinkie?
<Rainbow_Claus> Hell yeah.
<Ivan2294> Wait, but then you identified it
<ST_Falcon> Lying Black Sheep, Sorrowful Virgin, Wounded Lion, Swaying Scales.
<Ivan2294> PONIFY TETRIS
<Ivan2294> YES DO IT
<Rainbow_Claus> Outline: My point exactly.
*eXAKR pushes Light_Latias off, and takes her Soul Dew
<Nightmare_Moon> Pony tetris = Kamasutra for ponies
*Outline 's brain explodes.
*eXAKR feeds it to Nyan Cat
<Ivan2294> Ponify Command and Conqure
<Rainbow_Claus> MIND F- *RIMSHOT*
<prince-dari> Nyan cat should be immortalised somewhere.
<Ivan2294> Or Dune 2
<Ivan2294> Or quake

<Retsamoreh> Do you guys think Retsamoreh is better for a villian or protagonist name?
<Ivan2294> Well, burnout would be easy.
<Ivan2294> Burnout:Equestria
<Ivan2294> Also, that game would SUCK
<Nightboomfer> Mario Kart would be better

<Ivan2294> Rainbow Dash Road
*Light_Latias takes it back
<Ivan2294> Double Reading Rainbow Dash Road
<Games4me> Rainbow Dash already has a need for speed, so a Poniefied NFS would just be regular NFS, but you get to fly ponies.
<HSX> Hi
<Superev1> Retsamoreth would be good for an Anti-Hero. Happy?
<Ivan2294> Can we possibly add anymore references to Double Reading Rainbow Dash Road
<Outline> Couldn't say Retsa. It could go either way.
<Outline> It's neutral enough that you're free to do what you want with the character.
<drf|laptop> 03seriously the pony fad needs to die
<Retsamoreh> Eh. I was just looking for some opinions on it. EVERYONE I've asked has said it goes both ways.
<Games4me> ...Don't feed Retsa
<SilverSonic> ^
<drf|laptop> 03this is like the only place I know of that cares that much
<Ivan2294> Colt Recon: Advance Foalfighter 2
<Kosoveon> ^
<drf|laptop> 03none of the other IRC networks, nobody I know IRL, nothing
<Ivan2294> Rainbow Six?
<drf|laptop> 03I don't care if you like it, just stop making it a fad kthxbai
<prince-dari> All of my other IRC networks have bronies on it.
<Retsamoreh> Who said I was trolling? I was actually looking for opinions on it.
<JackiePie> Hi
<Light_Latias> lol
<prince-dari> And all my other forums.
<drf|laptop> 03then you need to find new networks.
<Ivan2294> End war? Splinter Cell? HAWX?
<SilverSonic> ^
<SilverSonic> Or make a channel and keep it there
<SilverSonic> not here please
<Ivan2294> We need to ponify all of these
<drf|laptop> 03that too
<Superev1> Almost every name is neutral. You can turn it in any direction.
<Nightboomfer> Pony Hawk's Equestrian Wasteland
<Games4me> All I'm saying is... this is a pony chat
<prince-dari> Lawl, you guys enjoy complaining.
<Ivan2294> lol
<Ivan2294> Good one night
<SilverSonic> Not really.
<Games4me> PONY HAWK
<Games4me> YES
<Games4me> THAT NEEDS TO BE A FANFIC
<Ivan2294> How can you ponify ENDWAR
<SilverSonic> But then again Drf is a mod so he can do what he bloody pleases
<SilverSonic> XD
<Ivan2294> Hmmm
*SilverSonic flees
<Ivan2294> Tom Clancy names are hard to ponify aren't they.
<Games4me> yup
<Nightboomfer> Rainbow Dash 6
*Nightboomfer shrug
<Flamerunner> What.
<Ivan2294> The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Dead or Alive, Sum of All Fears, The Bear and The Dragon.
<Flamerunner> Goldfinger
<Flamerunner> Ponify that
<Ivan2294> Coltfinger
<Ivan2294> done
<Flamerunner> It's a james bond movie
<Games4me> ponies dont have fingers
<Retsamoreh> Hunt for the Red October was ponified at some point. I forgot what it was called.
<Outline> Ehh. We need more pony terms.
<Nightboomfer> Goldhoof then
<Flamerunner> i though Goldhoov
<Flamerunner> hoof*
<Ivan2294> I just want a better name for Rainbow Six: Vegas 2
<Outline> A lot of these pony conversions are starting to sound same-y... and that's not a good thing.
<Ivan2294> Ponified
<Games4me> Rainbow Dash: Ponyville 2
<Ivan2294> And that's why we derail it
<prince-dari> Well this is some eventful silence. This is better than me posting MLP links, just nothing? Well that's stupid.
<Ivan2294> So, anyone play Ghost Recon?
<Ivan2294> *Failed attempt at Derail*
<Flamester> Got the entire series on steam for 20$
<Games4me> i have a demo, that's it
<Ivan2294> I got GRAW 2 from Ubishop for four bucks

<Kyro> -_- wow i suck at typing today -_-
<Chimera> It WAS kinda
<Ivan2294> Get what?
<Nightmare_Moon> Aww, appearently, linking ponified horrorgames loses my specialness.
<Chimera> Now it's more of a way of life
*Chimera runs
<Ivan2294> What specialness?
<cyrilthepony> voice
<prince-dari> I just remember it fondly as one of my childhood games. :/
<John316> the link? was it a reference?

<cyrilthepony> yes
<cyrilthepony> Dead Space
<Ivan2294> Voice?
<cyrilthepony> tis a game of great
<Chimera> It's my first :3
<ZekeS|AFK> Scootabuse saddens me :<
<ZekeS|AFK> ;-;
<Chimera> Gold~
<Prime_2> <Nightmare_Moon> Aww, appearently, linking ponified horrorgames loses my specialness. <-fording platforming games is more fun. http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5743/fordthatzone.png
<Nightmare_Moon> Someone said ponify horror games, So I linked them Dead Pony
<Outline> Lol. Even as a nightmarish beast from beyond, Scootaloo doesn't have a cutie mark :)
<Ivan2294> RE4 > Dead Space
<Ivan2294> RE5 > Dead Space 2
<Flamerunner> I think you mean
<Flamerunner> RE4 < Dead Space
<cyrilthepony> hmm
<Flamerunner> RE5 < Dead Space 2
<Games4me> that 2nd pic had no ponies, shame on you
<Nightmare_Moon> RE5 was an absolute disaster, I heard.
<Flamester> HL2 > RE4&DeadSpace
<Flamerunner> there correct
<cyrilthepony> RE5 is NOT better than deadspace 2
<cyrilthepony> no way
<Flamerunner> ^Win
<Ivan2294> (RE4 < Dead Space) < (RE5 > Dead Space)
<Nightmare_Moon> the halflife series has never been a horror series
<Prime_2> we don't go to ravenholm
<cyrilthepony> I could argue RE4 is better than the first or both of them
<prince-dari> I started with blue. (: I loved that game.
<cyrilthepony> but Dead Space did some really cool things with HUD and intereacting with teh enviornment
<Nightboomfer> So is the pound puppies reboot any good?
<cyrilthepony> its k
<prince-dari> I wish I still had it. :(
<Chimera> Blue ia actually pretty nice
<Chimera> Gold was amazing though
<Ivan2294> "the halflife series has never been a horror series" Neither has Dead Space
<Nightboomfer> I keep seeing the ads for it but I always leave after watching MLP
<Nightmare_Moon> Also, ZekeS|AFK, you betrayed me, after giving me a +
<Chimera> :3
<Ivan2294> Or Resident Evil
<Chimera> And I still have Blue >:3
<Games4me> agh whats RE?
*Chimera flees
<Games4me> oh nvm
<prince-dari> Yeah, I had gold too, my sister had silver.
<Games4me> lol
<prince-dari> I think the battery died in my blue.
<Chimera> I got GS and C
<prince-dari> Then I lost it. :'(
<Games4me> aaaaaaaand silence
<cyrilthepony> I will grant you that DeadSpace isn't as much horror as it is gore and startling butt...
<Nightmare_Moon> Deadspacecertainly has more atmosphere than RE, and it takes place in a VACUUM
<prince-dari> I had crystal too, yeah.
<cyrilthepony> its more horrifiying than halflife
<Nightboomfer> In shelter 17, we must rely on the one free puppy
<Ivan2294> So yeah RE5 > RE4 > Dead Space 2 > Dead Space
<JackiePie> Hi
<Fooby> I haven't played any of those games D:
<Pluto> hey bronies
<Games4me> sup
<cyrilthepony> Ivan, you placign RE5 at the top of that saddens me greatly
<Retsamoreh> Portal 2 is a horror game!
<John316> hi
<Ivan2294> Why?
<Ivan2294> Its RE5 with COOP
<Ivan2294> CO-OP > EVERYTHING ELSE
<cyrilthepony> oh, well okay
<Chimera> :c
<Outline> Sorry, What Retsa>?
<Nightmare_Moon> RE5 was shit, it's back to the same nonsense that made RE 1-3 bad
<cyrilthepony> if you think that way, sure
<Games4me> ok why are we talking about video games when we could be talking about ponies?!
<Outline> Portal 2? Horror?
<drf|laptop> 03this is a much better conversation
<Nightmare_Moon> RE4 was okay by my book
<Ivan2294> RE5 = RE4 With Co-op
<Outline> Not even close mate.
<drf|laptop> 03and I need a screwdriver that can open GB games
<drf|laptop> 03so i can replace the battery in my silver
<Ivan2294> RE5 is bad how?
<Nightboomfer> If we have ponies that control the sun and moon, are there ponies that control galaxies?
<cyrilthepony> I like wings, so pegasi ponies rule
<Ivan2294> EXACT SAME GAMEPLAY WITH TWO PEOPLE

<prince-dari> There was no conversation before, I just posted a link and you jumped on me.
<Nightboomfer> Or maybe a galaxy sized pony with a planet sized pony inside of it and a moon sized pony inside of that
<Ivan2294> No scary games anymore.....
<nickstr> drf, you need what is called a security screwdriver
<Ivan2294> Amnesia being the sole exception
<drf|laptop> 03can you link me to one?
<nickstr> that will look like a smaller inverted hex yead
<prince-dari> Also my friend has a screwdriver to open them.
<nickstr> *head
<cyrilthepony> Nightmare_Moon: Cyril approves this message
<cyrilthepony> Amnesia oh god
<nickstr> I might have the right bit on my screwdriver set
<Nightmare_Moon> Amnesia.. now THAT is how you build a good horror game
<Retsamoreh> Ponify Anmesia!

<Games4me> bah, the whole "ponies controlling nature" thing is full of scientific plot holes, dont even try to figure it out
<Chimera> Drf wtf with that "better conversation"
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03it's like
<Nightmare_Moon> It had the pacing Dead Space lacked, while it had the scary monsters RE lacks
