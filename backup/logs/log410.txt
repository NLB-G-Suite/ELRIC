<DashWithRainbows> You think I would degrade myself?
<ScootaChicken> Seriously, DashWithRainbows and LordCelestia drawing art together is not a pretty sight
<Tovler> http://derpy.me/z2FUz I wish Americans were more like this.
<LordCelestia> 0,5You kidding me?
<DashWithRainbows> YFW I haven't drawn all week ScootaChicken...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Our art would kick ASS
<LordCelestia> 0,5Mainly his
<ScootaChicken> (I subverted your expectations did I maek a funneh?)
<LordCelestia> 0,5but mine would be AMPLIFIED by his
<DashWithRainbows> LordCelestia you could draw the plot.
<ScootaChicken> LordCelestia: By your powers combined, you are...
<ScootaChicken> Dunno.
<DashWithRainbows> I don't draw plot.
<Tovler> hm. Are people making money off of memes?
<ScootaChicken> LordCelestia is amazing at plot
<LordCelestia> 0,5CAPTAIN BACON
<LordCelestia> 0,5*fanfare*
<ScootaChicken> LordCelestia commandeers plot on a regular basis.
<ScootaChicken> Like a captain.
<LunaTheBeloved> And talk goes to plot.....
<LordCelestia> 0,5You mean the SS Plot?
<Everlasting_Joy> Trolololol.
<LunaTheBeloved> Ah Regulars room......nothin like it...
<ScootaChicken> LordCelestia: No, I meant the Plotanic
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: IKR?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ah
<Quanyails> 7Got there.
<emangamer> why is this room not active all week??
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: because reasons
<Quanyails> 7Audio Codecs?
<LunaTheBeloved> I try to get it active....
<LordCelestia> 0,5Because no one is in here all week
<Everlasting_Joy> LunaTheBeloved: Don't you love it?
<ScootaChicken> I'm in here a fair bit
<emangamer> I make a motion that we all hang out in here all week...
<LunaTheBeloved> No one ever talks though...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Not even I lurk in here during the week
<ScootaChicken> I agree with emangamer
<LunaTheBeloved> I talk...nopony ever responds....
<drfsupercenter> 03hm,
*emangamer responds to LunaTheBeloved
<ScootaChicken> LunaTheBeloved: I would respond :3
<LordCelestia> 0,5Now now, dont direct all your attention here, rather than mane chat
<LunaTheBeloved> Usually Dken2021 does but that's usually it
<LunaTheBeloved> I stay out of mainchat
<LunaTheBeloved> *manechat
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/jicJI.png
<drfsupercenter> 03it should look something like that
<LordCelestia> 0,5yfw *main was right
<drfsupercenter> 03except not Realtek
<emangamer> LordCelestia: but the mane chat is full of idiots...
<LunaTheBeloved> Not to me
<emangamer> ^
<LordCelestia> 0,5technically, mane chat makes no sense
<LordCelestia> 0,5x3
<ScootaChicken> I occasionally lurk in #lobby
<ScootaChicken> But it's usually just me and Slurry
<SlurryMoon> 3hm?
<emangamer> I lurk in the secret room me yahooz and SlurryMoon know about :3
<emangamer> oh and SuperBrony64
<LunaTheBeloved> I haven't chatted on main chat since me and SB64 played Brawl on stream.....
*SlurryMoon is confused
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: the silly filly group?
*LunaTheBeloved hugs SlurryMoon
<LunaTheBeloved> Why?
<Tovler> Mane chat is so full despite there being no new episode.
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait, every intro?!
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: *raises an eyebrow* wah?
<ScootaChicken> SlurryMoon: There's this channel called #lobby that I think Ghosties created? And whenever I'm there you usually are.
<Quanyails> 7Audio Codecs, Intel(R) High Definition Audio HDMI Service, Legacy Audio Drivers, Legacy Video Capture Devices, Media Control Devices, Realtek High Definition Audio, Video Codecs.
<CCCP> G1 is not that bad actually
<LunaTheBeloved> mfw I heard that as Pony Randall
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: I dunno, it's the only group I know of that you, Yahooz and SB are in
<SlurryMoon> 3Oh, yeah
<CCCP> G3 sucks though
<DashWithRainbows> Right i'm off. ScootaChicken try to become legal faster, otakon grow back a beard and LordCelestia...I don't know.
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP I'm not saying that, I was mearly implying the inevitable. ..
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's probably Intel
<HyperMetalLugia> oh god intel
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<SlurryMoon> 3#lobby was the old #bronystateregulars
<drfsupercenter> 03well, it's not Realtek.
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: Quiet you.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
*LunaTheBeloved hugs DashWithRainbows
<HyperMetalLugia> nono
<HyperMetalLugia> well
<LunaTheBeloved> Night Dash!
<HyperMetalLugia> it should be realtek
<emangamer> DashWithRainbows: I'm legal in south carolina... gotta love the 16 year old age limit
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwut
<emangamer> night DashWithRainbows
<LordCelestia> 0,5When I made this channel, I didnt even know #lobby existed =___=
<drfsupercenter> 03REaltek is pretty nice, but every brand of sound card does their own MIDI rendering or what-have-tou
<drfsupercenter> 03*you
<LordCelestia> 0,5Night DWR!
<HyperMetalLugia> I have conexct/something
<drfsupercenter> 03ah, I think that's a Windows thing
<emangamer> night toast
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later DashWithRainbows!
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll just pretend your card is made by Microsoft unless you tell it otherwise x.x
*ScootaChicken hugs DashWithRainbows
<DashWithRainbows> emangamer britains legal age is 16...only two more years for Neil.
<ScootaChicken> Night Ashley :3
<HyperMetalLugia> My PC has a nice old Soundblaster
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care DashWithRainbows.
<emangamer> gaar me meet me may

<emangamer> samen hand in hand
<HyperMetalLugia> 2005ish or 2004 card
<kenne> is it me or did it suddenly get quieter
<ScootaChicken> DashWithRainbows: You have a calendar and everything, don't you.
<CCCP> hi GabeMoist
<GabeMoist> Ohai Communist
<Everlasting_Joy> Dah jeez! That's an aweful noise!
<CCCP> GabeMoist: what if You were Gabe Newell?
<emangamer> ScootaChicken is best jailbait (and the secksiest)
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, those are awesome
<ScootaChicken> Do people here know what I look like?
<Tovler> 'n' because "and" is too long and hard to spell.
<drfsupercenter> 03Creative soundcards are the way to go.
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: yes
<Everlasting_Joy> It's the Potato Head family.
<drfsupercenter> 03but 99% of the time, Realtek is fine
<ScootaChicken> I think I shared a photo of me like once
<drfsupercenter> 03just when it comes to MIDI, it kinda sucks
<GabeMoist> CCCP, Hats. Hats everywhere
<CCCP> ScootaChicken: i know what you look like
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah xD
<CCCP> GabeMoist: XD
<drfsupercenter> 03so uh
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: dont forget the video where you played drums on your guitar... that makes sense right?
<drfsupercenter> 03you know any good piano VSTis?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.yohng.com/software/piano.html <- I'm trying that one out
<CCCP> ScootaChicken: not really
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: yeah, but my face is mostly obscured entirely in that one
<Tovler> the movie with the bart simpson pony
<drfsupercenter> 03Reaper doesn't decode MIDIs on its own, you need the soundfont similar to your program
<emangamer> here's a hint, ScootaChicken is SOMEWHERE in this picture: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/e83f9f36-e221-4d71-8240-e43bd328c72b.png
<CCCP> Wasn't Danny Devito in GoodFellas?
<GabeMoist> I'm sure few people here have seen my visage
<GabeMoist> very few
<ScootaChicken> By hint, emangamer means bottom picture, far left
<Tovler> his wife rhea pearlman
<emangamer> so ScootaChicken is an embodyment of manliness...somehow...
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: MandoPony's on that list, it's hardly accurate
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, GabeMoist
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: is the guy in the blazer holding the guitar in the middle...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you ARE a thumb
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: lolwut
<junh1024-XD> <%drfsupercenter> yeah, trying any random MIDI, I get no sound output x.x < you need a VSTi
<LordCelestia> 0,5I know which one is scootachicken!
<LordCelestia> 0,5:D
<emangamer> LordCelestia: I do too...
<junh1024-XD> for it to make sound
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: let me address the problems with that statement
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03didn't I just say that?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Well obviously you do
<LordCelestia> 0,5:3
<drfsupercenter> 03I asked in #reaper and they told me how to do it
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: sorry, you're not awesome enought to be him
<LunaTheBeloved> This song isn't actually half bad....
<ScootaChicken> Firstly emangamer, it's not a blazer. Secondly, I'm not Jimmy from AcousticBrony
<Everlasting_Joy> Well this explains Winter Wrap UP.
<GabeMoist> I'm sure there are worse things to be...
<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: have you heard the deutch g3.5 theme?
<LunaTheBeloved> Yes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but you're the best thumb ever, GabeMoist
<emangamer> second best MLP theme ever
<junh1024-XD> i have a few, but if i import it as one track (not separate), the VSTis that i have break on it
<GabeMoist> ScootaChicken is Dusty!
<LunaTheBeloved> I said it wasn't ha;f bad
<GabeMoist> I KNEW IT
<ScootaChicken> GabeMoist: Nope, I'm MandoPony
<junh1024-XD> i could insert 27 unseparated VSTis but
<junh1024-XD> >time&effort
*emangamer is not best anything....
<drfsupercenter> 03OK wow
<HyperMetalLugia> http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg138/scaled.php?server=138&filename=fppinoutco0.jpg&res=landing < this card
<drfsupercenter> 03this has really odd sounding bass
<Tovler> manliness *gets sent away*
<drfsupercenter> 03it's also too d*** loud
<drfsupercenter> 03it's playing every track at like 100%
<GabeMoist> Saxy, Soon I hope to be a thumb with a handlebar mustache
<junh1024-XD> turn the master gain down
<emangamer> Luna: I cant thank you enough for sending me the dropbox link to the g3.5 theme
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, just did
<drfsupercenter> 03sounds a bit better now.
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why bass sticks out more when you overdrive
<CCCP> G1 = okay, G2 = meh, G3= Bad, G3.5= Bad, G3.6= Hell G4= Heaven
*emangamer puts it on loop
<Luna> 07,01your welcome :)
<ScootaChicken> SaxyPretender is best Foo Fighters song
*emangamer hugs Luna
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I look forward to it, GabeMoist
<Everlasting_Joy> Check the main chat folks.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, indeed, ScootaChicken
<LunaTheBeloved> The of the voices on the first few are terrible
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: foo fighters ftw
<LunaTheBeloved> *the effects on the voices
<ScootaChicken> mfw I don't think The Pretender is the best FF song
<emangamer> rainbow dash dresses in style?
<ScootaChicken> I prefer Everlong :P
<drfsupercenter> 03oh cool
<drfsupercenter> 03Reaper can play it fine without breaking
<drfsupercenter> 03prolly because of the VSTi
<junh1024-XD> (if you have separated tracks)
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: however, the pretender is still a good song
<drfsupercenter> 03it auto-separates them
<GabeMoist> When will we be airing this?
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: 'good'?
<junh1024-XD> unless you click no
<ScootaChicken> It's fucking brilliant
<drfsupercenter> 03Jesus christ
<drfsupercenter> 03it still sounds too loud
<Tovler> At least G3 is better than Inception /genericInternetDoucheyComment
<drfsupercenter> 03even at like -26dB
<GabeMoist> We should do a marathon of G3.5
<LunaTheBeloved> Dat bass is thumping....
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: compared to everlong it's good
<drfsupercenter> 03I think the individual tracks are overloading
<ScootaChicken> Everlong is still better though.
<emangamer> I like learn to fly, that one is pretty damn legit
<ScootaChicken> Everlong is one of the best Alternative Rock songs, ever.
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, it also automatically does the tempo, as it should
<ScootaChicken> Learn To Fly is great
<emangamer> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03does GarageBand 4 autotempo based on the MIDI or you still have to do it manually?
<emangamer> I like the scootaloo learn to fly cover
<ScootaChicken> as is pretty much all of Wasting Light
<emangamer> I have it on my ipod
<junh1024-XD> it should read in the MIDI tempo
<emangamer> mfw this chat has somehow dissolved to me and ScootaChicken
<ScootaChicken> Hey Johnny Park is a really good if underrated album song
<emangamer> hello?
<emangamer> is anypony else here?
<CCCP> hi
<ScootaChicken> Hello, is there anybody in there?
<emangamer> well ScootaChicken looks like we have to repop-DAMMIT CCCP
<ScootaChicken> Can anybody hear me?
<Tovler> 2012's G4 extended opening is missing.
<ScootaChicken> Is there anyone at home?
<CCCP> emangamer: :D
<drfsupercenter> 03so just 3 sucks at it?
*emangamer repopulates with ScootaChicken just because
<junh1024-XD> 3 has no suport for variable tempo
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: I'm too masculine.
<CCCP> O__o
<ScootaChicken> Soz.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but you said you had to manually specify the tempo?
<junh1024-XD> yep
<ScootaChicken> Also, if any of you want to know what I look like, ask Flaria, she has a picture of me saved on her hard drive for some reason
<junh1024-XD> one tempo for ALL of the song
<drfsupercenter> 03then it doesn't read it
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03but 4 will do that?
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: we are, combined, so masculine that one of eventually goes past 999 and eventually flips to feminine
<junh1024-XD> that's what i said
<drfsupercenter> 03I can go get my hackintosh out
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03when I'm done checkdisking it
<LunaTheBeloved> What is happenning in here....why are we repopulating...
<junh1024-XD> and that's what i said
<drfsupercenter> 03(the laptop)
<ScootaChicken> emangamer: only Saxy is manly enough to do that.
<emangamer> I mean, have you seen me with my swag? no one can match that
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh
<ScootaChicken> Actually no, only Saxy's jacket is manly enough to do that
<drfsupercenter> 03why does this sound WAY TOO LOUD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not an issue of actual volume
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not going about 0dB
<drfsupercenter> 03it just sounds overloaded
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, my favorite FF songs are: The Pretender, Learn to Fly, All My Life, Stacked Actors and Skin and Bones
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried not splitting the tracks up, same thing
<emangamer> ScootaChicken: obviously you havent looked at my swag picture long enough
<emangamer> I like them bones...that's a good song
<emangamer> Them Bones is pretty legit
<junh1024-XD> ill download all the VSTis
<junh1024-XD> might come in handy
<junh1024-XD> (off yohng
<drfsupercenter> 03ah hm
<ScootaChicken> Saxy's jacket is my true love...

<ScootaChicken> dafuq is Funkballs?
<LunaTheBeloved> ^

<junh1024-XD> i was gonna say, the Yallano Accentor is apparently the best-sounding Piano VSTi
<junh1024-XD> SUKASHI!
<junh1024-XD> its legality is questionable because apparently the author pirated commercial samples to make it
<junh1024-XD> *YANNLEO aCCENTOR
<UnFoundBug> you got the harpoon
<UnFoundBug> that thing hits like a truck
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> its the only one with much of a use
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> the SMG is maybe as good as the pulse rifle, and the striker glitches up and shoot blanks half the time
<junh1024-XD> SilverSonic here are the VSTs & VSTis i have http://imgur.com/a/KZRmi
<junh1024-XD> i use a jandful of VSTs regularly, and i know what most of them do

<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> wow, main chat is still going 300 mph
<drf-Droid> do you have that yallano thing?
<SilverSonic> me?
<drf-Droid> jun
<UnFoundBug> i tend to find fri-sun main rooms are too busy for any serious conversation anyway
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> they're mostly "what are we watching" and "why are we watchign this?"
<junh1024-XD> http://rapidshare.com/files/52866793/YANNLEO_ACCENTOR_X-1GP1.rar
<junh1024-XD> i haven't tried it though
<junh1024-XD> because it's slightly sizebloat
<UnFoundBug> yup
<UnFoundBug> they always demand sooo much more ponies
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> its surprising how much hate this fandom has for anything thats not ponies
<junh1024-XD> SilverSonic go quiz me on 3 of the VSTs i have and i'll tell you what they do
<SilverSonic> >lazy
<SilverSonic> naw.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> and main chat exploded XD

<drfsupercenter> 03Hogia I know
<junh1024-XD> do that
<drfsupercenter> 03I have to use something in order to hate it
<drfsupercenter> 03also uh
<drfsupercenter> 03it asks for tempo
<drfsupercenter> 03will it automatically hcnage?
<drfsupercenter> 03*change
<Hogia> 12What just happened.
<junh1024-XD> use 210
<junh1024-XD> drag n drop midi onto the project after you finish creating it
<Hogia> 12I have no FLACs
<Hogia> 12only crappy MP3s
<junh1024-XD> you only just noticed that i play flacs?
<drfsupercenter> 03sucks for you

<junh1024-XD> `\(°.o)/´
<junh1024-XD> anyway, you can rip your skrillex wubstep CD in flac
<drfsupercenter> 03uh

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jaketehsnake you there ?
<Jaketehsnake> I am. am I needed in the game>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<aji> which i just lost :(
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it sucks then ~
<drfsupercenter> 03k, well I gotta play with the tempos some more, that end part is like 60bpm or such
<junh1024-XD> kk
<drfsupercenter> 03so apparently it *doesn't* read the tempo from the MIDI
<junh1024-XD> use the automation at the bottom
<drfsupercenter> 03I even set it to 210 when hitting new project
<drfsupercenter> 03and it reset to whatever
<Hogia> 12ffft screw you gravity
<Hogia> 12nearly dropped the keyboard again >.<
<drfsupercenter> 03what did you press to get rid of the dock?

<drfsupercenter> 03eh I fixed it anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03and OK
<Ascendant> I went back to KFC because the idiots there gave me a non-zinger fillet instead of a zinger one
<Ascendant> so
<Ascendant> these two chicks who were sitting at a table next to us
<junh1024-XD> ZINGABURGER ZINGAZINGABURGER!
<Ascendant> decided to hit on Drake while I was gone
<Ascendant> apparently
<Ascendant> he was asked whether I was his girlfriend or not
<junh1024-XD> ( ¬‿¬)
<Ascendant> it was kinda creepy
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04It was
<Drake> 04and you refused to look at them
<junh1024-XD> Drake do you have any //comments?
<Ascendant> Drake
<Drake> 04?
<Ascendant> I was too busy staring at you
<Ascendant> to look at them
<Drake> 04How touching
<Ascendant> it's not that I refuse to look at people
<Drake> 04But damn you made that awkward
<Ascendant> It's that I'm usually more interested in looking at OTHER people
<Ascendant> that's my job you idiot
<Ascendant> your job is to bee an as*hole
<Ascendant> lol I suddenly remembered my bee signature
<Ascendant> "Stop beeing stupid"
<Ascendant> actually
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> as you so eloquently stated, you're supposed to be the masochist
<Ascendant> And I'm supposed to be the sadist in our relationship
<Ascendant> I can comply with that if you wish
<Ascendant> ;)
<Drake> 04No
<Drake> 04:I
<Ascendant> you shouldn't have said that then
<Drake> 04I have enough fun being the masochist to Skylands
<Ascendant> You do that
<Ascendant> you just know you want more of my sadism though >|
<Ascendant> And I'm not really that sadistic anyway
<Ascendant> ask drf
<Ascendant> I'm not really a sadist
<Ascendant> That's Larxene or Hensh
<Ascendant> or Xemnas even
<Ascendant> ...
<Ascendant> those 2/3 in the same sentence?
<Ascendant> no thanks actually
<Drake> 04Yeah, you're actually not that sadistic.

<Drake> 04I'm just like
<Drake> 04"Ok cool now let's skedaddle"
<Ascendant> yeah
<Drake> 04I'm not used to women hitting on me ;_;
<Ascendant> we kinda left pretty quickly
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Ascendant> we were like
<drfsupercenter> 03if anybody tried to hit on me
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd be like
<Ascendant> "Why the hell were they hitting on YOU?"
<drfsupercenter> 03naked on the bed in 10 seconds
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> lmao
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> the girl who tried to hit on Drake
<Drake> 04was a skank
<Ascendant> was a sl*t anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03that sounds hot
<drfsupercenter> 03did you take any pictures?
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> nah, not descriptive enough
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> as I told Drake
<Ascendant> on the wall of one of my school's changerooms
<Ascendant> it's like
<Ascendant> "If sl*ts could fly, NSG would be an airport"
<Ascendant> NSG is my school
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<drfsupercenter> 03ooh
<Drake> 04We had some deep, introspective conversations afterwards.
<drfsupercenter> 03a spam email entitled "cute & horny"
<drfsupercenter> 03that sounds legit
<Drake> 04Mostly involving questions like "Why the hell would anyone hit on US?"
<drfsupercenter> 03and you had a serious discussion about how ugly you both are?
*drfsupercenter hides
<Drake> 04Pretty much
*Drake hides
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> Anyway
<Ascendant> I'm going to go play some starpoint gemini
<Ascendant> and then some oblivion
<Ascendant> or I might go turn on the PS2
<Ascendant> and play some KH2 or Jedi Starfighter
<Ascendant> or ROTS
<drfsupercenter> 03I read that as RIOTS
<Drake> 04k
<Drake> 04cya NS
<Ascendant> might go with starfighter as I've been playing a crapload of hack n slash games
<Drake> 04Starfighter <3
<Ascendant> yah
<Ascendant> I still want Assassin's Creed on Steam though
<Ascendant> either that or pirate it
<drfsupercenter> 03how much is it?
<Ascendant> dunno
<Ascendant> something like $20, it's pretty expensive
<Ascendant> also
<drfsupercenter> 03that's cheap for a game
<Ascendant> is it?
<Ascendant> Well
<Ascendant> I got oblivion GOTY for $30
<Ascendant> but yeah, what is your paypal account? I'll send you something for funding the hetzner server

<junh1024-XD> hmm
<junh1024-XD> not in garageband
<junh1024-XD> but in logic you can
<drfsupercenter> 03fail.
*junh1024-XD hides
<Ascendant> ah Drake
<drfsupercenter> 03I doubt logic would run on a VM, eh?
<Ascendant> I finished that one yesterday
<Ascendant> it was quite easy
<Drake> 04I loved that mission
<junh1024-XD> doesn't hurt in trying
<Drake> 04Ion Cannon <3
<Ascendant> I hate Sabaoth fighters though
<Ascendant> yeah the Ion Cannon was <3
<Drake> 04Because basically, those things were wrecking our sh!t beforehand. It was good to have one on our side XD

<Meanwhile> otakon: doesn't look mayorish though does it.
<otakon> it is
<Kammerjunk> I swear, mane chat is like if 4chan teamed up with the KKK.
<ScootaChicken> And she's still always Derpy to me/billyjoel
<otakon> lol
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: it's more the exclusion of her name.
<Kammerjunk> So much hate.
<Yahooz> so many exits
<otakon> ScootaChicken: same here man, same here.
<Tovler> Want the rage reaction to be posted.
<RAWRity> and the fact that it IS censorship.
<otakon> RAWRity: it IS
<UnFoundBug> ScootaChicken the voice i can deal with, hell it was a legetimate mistake
<Yahooz> Guys, why dont we go episode protocol?
<otakon> brb, getting coffee
<UnFoundBug> but the name....

<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: Inb4 he's a sexbomb.
<RAWRity> like I did with "Rawrity" last week
<ScootaChicken> He needs to take a /nick to the IRC
<ScootaChicken> otakon: too late, already tracked his IP address, going to kill him
<otakon> hey, has ANYONE come up with a name for that lanky mailpony?
<RAWRity> Yahooz: we should tell anybody who asks about the new episode that it was meant to air, but they had to edit out another derpy scene.
<otakon> RAWRity: lol
<Hype> ____ Bluebadge, I suggest
<otakon> that would REALLY cause some rage
<Hype> Need a forename
<Meanwhile> Fuel to the fire much

<Hype> People being kicked from mane room
<Yahooz> Kicks from mane chat since 1 pm
<Hype> Averaging about 1 a minute, atm
<UnFoundBug> otakon who you plaiyn with
<Hype> Since the first kick was at about 13:03
<ScootaChicken> You guys should have been there during PinkieQuest
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: OH LORD
<ScootaChicken> the Toot spam and subsequent mass kicking needed to be seen to be believed
<otakon> UnFoundBug: just a random game atm, for some reason I keep getting dc'd from the servers
<Yahooz> So much TOOT
<Meanwhile> The unmitigated toot spam.
<otakon> UnFoundBug: gonna run a game to make sure it's working okay is all
<UnFoundBug> ouch, fair enough, ill head to the shops for now then, up for some later?
<Yahooz> Guys, if they played Pinkie Quest right before ep next week and had mane chat open... we might throttle the network
<ScootaChicken> Oh god
<ScootaChicken> The unrelenting toot spam
<Tovler> The mane chat will be closed though
<Meanwhile> I'm still going to be in chat but could someone say when the movie starts please?
<Hype> I'll ping you
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: movie's starting.
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: it starts at 2 like always
<Yahooz> just be back by then
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: From my perspective that was 4 hours ago
<Hype> 7pm, Meanwhile
<Hype> Is when it starts
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: *7pm you silly Brit
<Meanwhile> Yeah but I'm watching MiB the series, I can trust myself to do things like "check the time"
<Meanwhile> can't*
<RAWRity> alright, Here's our story for anybody who comes in after now and asks about a new episode: We tell them we were watching it live, and we got to a scene where Derpy was talking again, and was giving a Muffin to Dinky, when suddenl the feed from The Hub cutout because of "technical difficulties" but we suspect it was Hasbro trying to cover their asses.
<Meanwhile> That's a stupid idea.
<Yahooz> ^
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: stupid idea for stupid people
<Yahooz> How about we tell them they missed the ep?
<Meanwhile> How about we tell them there was no new ep today.
<UnFoundBug> yeah, just missed the ep is amusing enoguh
<Hype> Or we can be honest
<Yahooz> Meanwhile: THATS a stupid idea
<ScootaChicken> I'm with RAWRity, trolling unobservant people sounds amusing
<Meanwhile> That's just mean.
<UnFoundBug> adding too much too it makes it unbelievable
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: it's also harmless and hilarious.
<UnFoundBug> Meanwhile thats why its trolling
<Yahooz> Watch this
<Meanwhile> Trolling is against the rules.
<ScootaChicken> So who remembers the Vocaroo spam last night?
<UnFoundBug> i do
<RAWRity> Alright, how about this: We tell them Vinyl Scratch spoke, and was actually a stallion.
<Meanwhile> Trolling is STILL against the rules.
<RAWRity> Or we tell them that Luna got a song
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: Since when have you been opposed to trolling.
<Hype> lol
<Hype> Yahooz
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Yes.
<Hype> You got ignored
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken I am many things, but I am not a troll.
<UnFoundBug> Do not troll
<UnFoundBug> Intentionally irritating other users for the sole purpose of eliciting an angry response is not permitted.
<UnFoundBug> damn you copy paste!
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: that's not what emangamer says...
<RAWRity> alright, that's what we're telling anypony who comes in asking if they missed the new episode. Luna got a song, and Vinyl spoke.
<Meanwhile> emangamer is a creepy fuckwit.
<Meanwhile> I couldn't care less what he says.
<UnFoundBug> so isnt all our shipping trolling?
<ScootaChicken> Now that's just mean.
<ScootaChicken> I'm pretty sure generating this is trolling http://vocaroo.com/i/s0uAtkd3sC8P
<Meanwhile> Mean, but true.
<Yahooz> RAWRity: Trixie came back and fell in love with a bg named
<Tovler> "Thanks for making feel like a retard for not knowing there was a new episode, RAWRity."
<Yahooz> Meanwhile:
<RAWRity> UnFoundBug: My goal with this is not to ellicit an ANGRY response. It's to amuse myself.
<UnFoundBug> true, but that amusement is based on the negative emotions of another
<UnFoundBug> be it anger or sadness
<Hype> My hero, UnFoundBug
<ScootaChicken> I think it's called Schadenfreude
<RAWRity> UnFoundBug: no, it's based on the positive reactions of my fellow conspirators.
<UnFoundBug> ScootaChicken that is correct, there is no english word, but there is a german on
<UnFoundBug> one*
<Yahooz> Kick 8
<Yahooz> *9
<RAWRity> Yahooz: you're counting kicks now?
<Yahooz> since 1 pm
<Kammerjunk> "I have you now."
<RAWRity> f
<Yahooz> uck
<RAWRity> c
<Yahooz> rap
<RAWRity> h
<Yahooz> ell
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: if we'd been counting since PinkieQuest, I think that number would be much, much higher
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: indeed
<Meanwhile> High as a kite.
<Yahooz> LOLZ
<DarkstyleZ> Hmph, do you still believe their lies, and slander now?
<MakerDusk> Meanwhile: that was me last night
<ScootaChicken> High as everyone at Woodstock
<MakerDusk> now I'm burned out >_<
<Yahooz> Kick 10
<ScootaChicken> MakerDusk: Drugs are bad, m'kay>?
<MakerDusk> I didn't even plan it out
<MakerDusk> they are
<Yahooz> lolwut MakerDusk?
<MakerDusk> I simply went out for a cigarette
<MakerDusk> and then, there was a circle in my backyard
<Meanwhile> To the moooooon
<Yahooz> Crying dash canon
<MakerDusk> blarg! Luna
<MakerDusk> >_<
<ScootaChicken> and then Dusky blew up the server in revenge
<Yahooz> Kick 11
<Yahooz> inb4 12
<Hype> Cherrychanga, definitely.
<ScootaChicken> I can't wait for this Scoota-Chicken guy to get kicked
<Meanwhile> Inb4 he never is
<RAWRity> so we're agreed: anybody who asks about the new ep, we tell them that Luna got a song and vinyl talked.
<Yahooz> hes probably gonna leave
<Meanwhile> Inb4 he's the nicest nice guy who was ever nice.
<ScootaChicken> Sure
*MakerDusk contemplates adding himself to the immune list for the channel...
<Tovler> Yes. The best episode
<RAWRity> Tovler: riiiiiiiiiight
<MakerDusk> but ya... long story short, was a beautiful day, so we made daqueries
<MakerDusk> and most of the block joined in
<ScootaChicken> daqueries?
<MakerDusk> you know, the blended frozen berries with lots of alcohol
<Tovler> Derpy's clean and pro-normal voice and the most beloved episode of Season 2.
<ScootaChicken> I didn't know alcohol could get you high
*MakerDusk snuggles up to a Luna
<Yahooz> Kick 12
<Meanwhile> Don't you hate it when you're writing a sonnet and Al Capone walks up and he's all like "Ibbleibbleibble"
<kenne> why dont i remmeber any of this stuff frpm the episodes
<ScootaChicken> <Scoota-Chicken> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<ScootaChicken> Kay, fuck this guy
<Meanwhile> I like him more than you now.
<MakerDusk> kenne: because you don't play ponified apples to apples
<ScootaChicken> Don't lie, you can't resist my jailbait-ness.
<Meanwhile> Frankly, I've never actually seen your jailbait-ness.
<RAWRity> Hmmm.... Meanwhile x Trixie x ScootaChicken threesome?
<ScootaChicken> If you want.
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: He isn't legal.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: and that's what makes it so naughty
<Meanwhile> And Trixie's a scuzzball.
<ScootaChicken> I'm writing a RAWRity x Meanwhile fic at the moment though.
<Meanwhile> DAfuq
<RAWRity> also, in Mexico he's legal.
<Meanwhile> This isn't Mexico
<ScootaChicken> and Germany
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: it could be.
<Meanwhile> Fack everything.
<Hype> And Japan, and the Vatican
<Yahooz> and Amsterdam
<Kammerjunk> And Denmark.
<Hype> the Vatican has an unbelievably low age of consent
<Hype> But I can't remember what it is
<Meanwhile> That isn't even surprising.
<ScootaChicken> That's so unsurprising.
<Meanwhile> Dohoho pedo priest jokes.
<ScootaChicken> what Meanwhile said
<Meanwhile> Briefly bring the stream back up, it's the "RD is an extra douchey douche" one.
<Meanwhile> Noooo.
<Kammerjunk> Pinkie's right. Twilight is a silly filly.
<Hype> RD is best pony
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Meanwhile> RD is worst mane 6.
<ScootaChicken> [18:38]	Scoota-Chicken	Rainbow Dash is overrated pony.
<RAWRity> I disagree with people who say Rainbow Dash is being so terrible in this episode.
<ScootaChicken> imposter has a point
<Meanwhile> She's not being terrible, just a braggart.
<RAWRity> She's saving people's lives. So what if she acts like she's hot shit?
<Hype> She is hot shit.
<ScootaChicken> I'd do her.
<ScootaChicken> I mean, um er
<Meanwhile> I dislike RD some of the time for the same reason I hate Trixie, arrogance.
<RAWRity> I'd rather have a jerky super hero save my life, than have all these super humble people stare as I fall to my death.
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: you want me to request your imposter to nick change?
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: I find it funny that you hate arrogance.
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: Sure
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Yeah yeah har de har har
<Hype> So much animosity
<Kammerjunk> Screw that. If I want to pick a pizza with only chili and dough, let me do it, damn iy.
<Meanwhile> offensive display of superiority or self-importance; overbearing pride. I wouldn't say that describes me.
<ScootaChicken> Um...
<otakon> kenne, RX-78-3-SweetieBot, UnFoundBug well the servers are down
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> fun
<kenne> lolwut
<otakon> yeah
<RAWRity> my issue with this ep is that the REST of the Mane 6 come off as bigger assholes in this.
<otakon> I can't connect to the servers, but I'm online just fine
<otakon> so it's NOT my net
<Yahooz> I asked him ScootaChicken. he feels pretty bad
<Meanwhile> Yeah yeah RAWRity "Why don't they just talk to her" Probably because she wouldn't listen anyway, plus that was probably more fun.
<Yahooz> [13:41:58] <Scoota-Chicken> Uhm, sure. I didn't eman to hurt someone's feelings.. :U Just came to mind.
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: aww... I feel guitly now
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: What's his new nick?
<ScootaChicken> I wanna go say something nice to him
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: good friends right there, assuming the worst of you and not trying to talk to you like human bei- er, pony being
<ScootaChicken> And possibly ship him with otakon.
<otakon> no
<otakon> no friggin shipping
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken x Scoota-Chicken = OTP
<otakon> do I have to get the audio clip again?
<ScootaChicken> gosh darnit RAWRity
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Would you REALLY think Rainbow Dash, while pumped up on being the big hero, would at all care what anyone says?
<ScootaChicken> otakon: no need, I have it saved
<otakon> ScootaChicken: ofc you do
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: I would at least give her the benefit of the doubt and TRY
<RAWRity> I'd try the regular approach before becoming Darkwing Duck
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Clearly they're better friends because they already know how she'd react.
<Meanwhile> Besides, Mare-Do-Well is best hero.
<otakon> kenne, UnFoundBug, RX-78-3-SweetieBot well from the looks of things all of EA's servers are stressed atm, thus why I can't connect atm
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken: he didnt /nick he refreshed the chat so i dont know. I think it may or may not be PinkieShy but just a guess. I would ask around the mane chat
<RAWRity> also the fact that they brag and boast about their OWN accomplishments, just to make Dash feel bad.
<otakon> too bad for being a multi BILLION dollar company that overchargers for stuff they don't update their SERVERS
<ScootaChicken> Yahooz: given how fast chat's moving that might be pretty difficult, but I'll give it a shot
<RAWRity> otakon: they're busy geting the ME3 DLC ready
<ScootaChicken> oh christ, looking through the list of people in chat there's someone named after a clopfic
<otakon> RAWRity: well, you THINK they would TELL US they are shutting them down or something
<ScootaChicken> a HiE clopfic no less
<otakon> in here?
<Kammerjunk> Dash has absolutely NO internal dialogue.
<otakon> she's a ALICORN
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: whats their name?
<ScootaChicken> RARWRity: twiandme
<RAWRity> ...and how do you know the title of a clopfic.
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: reasons.
<ScootaChicken> Being around Saturn long enough does these things to you
<otakon> nvm, I just reconnected, but I've been getting randomly dc'd from the Servers all morning
<otakon> dat neck cracking
<otakon> hello? Is this thing on?
*otakon taps his computer screen
<ScootaChicken> No.
<otakon> ofc not.....
<otakon> "Jennifer"
<ScootaChicken> otakon x Jenni-
<ScootaChicken> Wait no
<otakon> lol
<ScootaChicken> I wouldn't do that to her
<otakon> XD
<otakon> ScootaChicken: don't you remember Ash's pet name for you?
<Hype> otakon x otakon17
<otakon> .......
<ScootaChicken> otakon: he has lots of pet names for me
<otakon> Hype: I'm otakon17

<ScootaChicken> Y'know, I saw a certain 'otakon17' in #brony earlier
<ScootaChicken> otakon, what were you doing in that terrible place
<Hype> Nothing wrong with loving yourself, otakon
<ScootaChicken> You're far too young and innocent for it
<otakon> ScootaChicken: yeah, i'm just hooked in there I never really talk in there
<otakon> ScootaChicken: I'm TWICE YOUR AGE!
<otakon> ScootaChicken: and how do YOU know I'm in there?
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Almost twice.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: you're 14 correct?
<ScootaChicken> otakon: I saw 'otakon17 has joined #brony'
<ScootaChicken> otakon: yesh

<otakon> RAWRity: not the explosions!
<LunaTheBeloved> Michael Bay explosions!
<LunaTheBeloved> BOOM
<RAWRity> no, these aren't Michael Bay explosions.
<LunaTheBeloved> I know....
<RAWRity> These explosions are from before Michael Bay even dreamed of ruining cinema
<otakon> LunaTheBeloved: nothing in this movie is made of Baynium, so no worries about that.
<otakon> well said RAWRity
<otakon> let us discuss our dislike of Bay shall we?
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh
<otakon> like how he's going to mutilate the TMNT
<UnFoundBug> but his new TV show might be good
<RAWRity> My real problem with Bay is taht he's been so succesful, other movies are now copying him.
<otakon> Micheal Bay Blows S*** Up?
<otakon> RAWRity: dear God, help us all.
<UnFoundBug> nope, a reboot of RobotWars / Battlebots
<otakon> UnFoundBug: actually, that might not be too bad
<UnFoundBug> i know right
<RAWRity> UnFoundBug: Id be okay with that.
<RAWRity> I liked Robot Wars as a kid.
<RAWRity> and with the technology that's around to day...it could be pretty kick ass
<UnFoundBug> I was like oh god no one should let him on TV, then i was like i liked robot wars, he does impressive looking things
<otakon> I liked Robotwars/Battlebots it was neat
<UnFoundBug> RAWRity you ever seen it live
<otakon> OH did you see that one bot?
<UnFoundBug> Razer?
<otakon> it was just made, what was it called again....
<UnFoundBug> Chaos 2
<UnFoundBug> HypnoDisk?
<otakon> no, it has 5 legs
<otakon> can morph into a ball
<UnFoundBug> eww walker bots
<LunaTheBeloved> Well guys...I'm gonna go watch some Community.....Ping if SlurryMoon gets here please
<UnFoundBug> ooh that omniball thing?
<otakon> LunaTheBeloved: okay dear, take care.
<RAWRity> otakon: the Super Cycle from Young Justice?
<otakon> UnFoundBug: YES! I think that thing has combat potential
<UnFoundBug> as a targert
<otakon> just armor it
<otakon> and add a gun
<UnFoundBug> razer would eat that thing for breakfast
<otakon> it's NOT ARMORED, without armor "Razer" would be a glorified RC car.
<UnFoundBug> Razer is the single most powerful robot ever made, and has only been beaten due to mechanical failue, and a cheat
<UnFoundBug> razer takes on the house robot and wins ffs
<otakon> UnFoundBug: what was teh cheat?
<UnFoundBug> Tornado
<UnFoundBug> added a 1-foot box around the rim
<UnFoundBug> so big it could no longer fit in the pit

<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 6Unfezant.
<otakon> god, did they HAVE to kill him?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Yes.
<otakon> ofc you would say that RX-78-3-SweetieBot
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> And now they have to kill you. With moldy cereal.
<otakon> NOT THE MOLDY CEREAL!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> So EA accidentally the servers eh?
<otakon> http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp
<otakon> yeah, from the looks of things the Servers are getting overloaded
<otakon> take that test, then compare the results to this: http://sage.bloowuff.com/mlp/personality_chart.jpg
<Bjornfot> oh hello regulars
<otakon> I'm apparently Cheerilee
<otakon> also, the fac that the ponies can IDENTIFY with actual personality types is a good indication on how well they're fleshed out as characters if you ask me.
<otakon> hiya Bjornfot
<Bjornfot> sup pingas
<otakon> why am I a pinga?
<otakon> enope
<Bjornfot> ooh I am Celestia
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I got celestia, although the N is very weak, so one question answered differently would give me big mac instead
<LunaTheBeloved> Lol
<LunaTheBeloved> I got Luna :3
<Viri> 14Saturday evening
<Viri> 14and I'm in my pajama
<Viri> 14:D
<otakon> lol
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I would be a great ruler. First things first, everyone gets robot bodies. Think GITS for the most part.
<Bjornfot> I assume that over 50% is one thign and under 50% is another?
<otakon> no RX-78-3-SweetieBot I don't want a robot body
<otakon> I like being flesh and blood thank you
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 5Shelgon.
<otakon> and is anyone else getting lag?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Thats fine, people can opt out of it if they want.
<otakon> unlike THE ENDING OF MASS EFFECT 3!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> But you have to want out. If you cant decide wether you want the robot body or not, you get it anyway.
<otakon> argh, curse you lag, curse you to the hanging upside down hell!
<otakon> and then it LAGGED AGAIN!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Next step is removing alot of safety regulations so idiots will start getting themselves killed more often.
<otakon> but they'll have ROBOT BODIES
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> And you think they still wont find ways to kill themselves?
<otakon> won't it take a bit more to kill them then it would an average human?
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 3Mantyke.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> People can be really REALLY stupid. and the crazy amount of safety regulations we have are the only reason they have not removed themselves fromt eh genepool
<Skylands> 10Viri, Saturday afternoon and I'm in my pajamas :P
<otakon> good point
<Viri> 14:D
<otakon> ever hear of the Darwin Awards?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Although you ahve a point. I think Ill save the robot bodies for after the idiots kill themselves
<Skylands> 10I changed into them as soon as I got home
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> yes
<Skylands> 10It's so colddd
<Viri> 14you had a very intense week too? xD
<Viri> 14same
<otakon> good stuff
<Viri> 14I had 6 tests in 3 days
<otakon> argh, curse you lag
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> but the darwin awards are only for absolutely exceptional idiocy
<Viri> 14I spent all the week studying. So sorry if I wasn't in chan ^^;
*Skylands had 4 tests today
<Aurora> 6Korrrraaaaaaaaa
<Nick> oo
<HyperMetalLugia> Korraa when?!
<HyperMetalLugia> :O

<Aurora> 6today is the premier
<Viri> 14o.o
<Aurora> 6well, now for western coast
<HyperMetalLugia> wow.
<HyperMetalLugia> I thought it was like
<HyperMetalLugia> in May
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<otakon> yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> About time it aired ;-;
<otakon> but anyway, robot bodies? really? that would take some getting used to.
<Viri> 14Ray :3
<Ray> 02:3
<Aurora> 6noooooooo commercials
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> That realy depends on how human they are.
<Nick> Going out now
<Nick> Cyall
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> with a very human-like one, the only main differences would be no more needing to eat or remove waste, although power will need to be recharged still, and could be set up to basically be part of a sleep cycle, to help keep things familiar
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6nick when the hell did you get here
<Aurora> 6you've been gone for like ages
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6fml i've only been trying to get ahold of him for 3 weeks.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Although having less humanoid things would be fine for those that want them.
<UnFoundBug> hey otakon / RX-78-3-SweetieBot you guys up for some ME3?
<Hype> I did that humanmetrics test, got Trixie. :3
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I wonder how many people would want to be a robot horse/pony....
<otakon> UnFoundBug: not atm I think, maybe in a bit
<Viri> 14don't worry
<UnFoundBug> fair enoguh
<Viri> 14I'm still here! :D
*Viri runs
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: well, if I could grab things with my hooves I wouldn't mind. I would miss bacon though.....
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I wouldnt be surprised if it becomes possible to make synthetic taste buds.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> so you could eat and taste things, you just dont have to
<Bjornfot> You guys usually play ME3?
<otakon> yeah, but then it boils down to artificially recreating the 5 senses inorgainically
<otakon> yeah Bjornfot on 360
<Bjornfot> I stopped playing multiplayer when I finished the game lawl
<otakon> we usually play a couple of Silvers every other day or so
<otakon> Bjornfot: it's fun unlocking new stuff, plus we laugh our asses off.
<UnFoundBug> otakon we really should start moving to gold, after we get kenne to behaev
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I wonder what having reverse joint legs as a robot would be like....
<otakon> UnFoundBug: that might take weeks
<UnFoundBug> thing is we know you, me and RX-78-3-SweetieBot can all run gold
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: off balance, since your brain isn't used to balancing like that
<Bjornfot> I'm gonna continue ditching ME3 until they release the free extra ending and multiplayer dlc
<otakon> UnFoundBug: yeah, but it's damn hard!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Bjornfot: the multplayer DLC is out already
<Bjornfot> oh, really?
<otakon> Bjornfot: you'll be waiting until SUmmer for teh Ending, and the MP DLC JUST came out, new characters/maps and weapons.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> yes
<Bjornfot> still, ending
<otakon> and it's FREE
<otakon> BOTH are free
<otakon> you just have to unlock the characters/weapons through buying reinforcement packs
<otakon> dat FAMAS
<otakon> they have what? HPK45?
<ScootaChicken> Does it sound like I'm ordering a fuckin' pizza?
<otakon> lol I love that line
<ScootaChicken> That's me announcing my return, by the way.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> dont remember, havent brushed up on my french guns in a while
<ScootaChicken> Fun fact, I bought a pizza
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: You are blind roughly 40 minutes each day.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Also, otakon would be a robotic oompah loompah, and his work name would be Mr. Chewy McFlubster
<otakon> brb
<otakon> no it wouldn't
<LunaTheBeloved> It's so nice outside...
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Everyone should totally start calling oatkon Chewy Mcflubster
<SilverSonic|Live> http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u

<Viri> 14school was getting pretty intense xP and I was risking to fail the year

<otakon> I was playing a H/Sentinel lvl 20 and went down TWICE because I was rusty in how they play

<SheenaFox> and skype? :D
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I cant decide how I would want to build geth engie.
<otakon> UnFoundBug: you click the little circles to affect the rank of the weapon on your loadout
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: I'm gonna go full on defensive turret with Chain Overloads all the way
<otakon> the only thing that'll give him grief will be armor
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> by defensive you mean the sheild restoring all the way?
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> just pop it next to me and take a nice defensive position
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I might go for a full offensive one then to keep from role overlap
<SilverSonic|Live> AE TUNE IN
<otakon> it would be a good idea,
<otakon> but ofc, we have to GET them frist

<otakon> use Biotic Sphere as a "trap"
<UnFoundBug> lol, just reaving everything
<otakon> how can you LOSE at a co-op game?
<otakon> that's a LOT of detonators
<otakon> wait, how does that even work?
<otakon> can you set off C4 just by dropping it with the detonators in it?
<UnFoundBug> no
<UnFoundBug> c4 is incredibly stable
<otakon> yeah, that's why they like it
<UnFoundBug> unless the detonator is triggered
<otakon> could it be a shock detonator?
<UnFoundBug> you can use it as cooking fuel
<otakon> I've heard
<UnFoundBug> the only thing that sets of c4 is another explosion
<UnFoundBug> hence why its always a secondary explosion
<otakon> ah
<otakon> man, this movie is classic

<HyperMetalLugia> But until it: 1. Has ICS HW Accel support and 2. A way to use a USB stick for extra storage
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll wait

<Jaketehsnake> Ode To Joy ensues
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, what about it?
<Jaketehsnake> Maid I know that feel. Maybe we could get a game going afterthis
<otakon> dat armor
<otakon> dat money
<Maidwhile> Batarian sentinel is best armour.
<Maidwhile> Blades, blades everywhere.
<otakon> Maidwhile: eh, not really. They have lower DR and health/shields than Krogans
<Maidwhile> Wouldn't know
<otakon> Maidwhile: but they DO have one of the best crowd control skills in the game
<Maidwhile> I shoot people, I don't do statistics.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13also I need food
<Angel_Umbreon> 13too lazy to get food
<otakon> Maidwhile: it's as much stats as it is skill
<Quanyails> 7I don't get the sort of 'rips' you do. YouTube quality.
<Maidwhile> If you have skill, you don't need stats.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why :P
<Quanyails> 7It's not as if I need those. :U
<Maidwhile> I could pour over the ins and outs of shields, manueverability, reload time to shooting ratio and so forth, or I could just grab a gun and kick ass.
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm just saying
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<Quanyails> 7Unlike your fancy stuff.
<HyperMetalLugia> But fullscreen sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03watching them on a PC is fine if you have legitimate rips
<Maidwhile> And so far, so good.
<HyperMetalLugia> You can't see the time!
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<drfsupercenter> 03In fact, I just record TV straight to my computer and play it back
<UnFoundBug> maid, or you can do both
<Vinyer> o-O
<drfsupercenter> 03same quality.
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<UnFoundBug> and kick some serious ass
<drfsupercenter> 03and LOL HML
<Maidwhile> Why would I want to do that? Stats are boring.
<drfsupercenter> 03I have two monitors, remember?
<Jaketehsnake> I do the second. Kicking ass is more fun
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Maidwhile> I already melee primes to death, why would I want to dull it down.
<Angel_Umbreon> 132 screens 1 drf
*Angel_Umbreon runs
<drfsupercenter> 03hm darn, I need to get my hair cut, but this place closes in an hour
<drfsupercenter> 03and I don't even know if they do walk-ins
<drfsupercenter> 03I should prolly call them
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean it doesn't have to be *today*
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm bored
<UnFoundBug> how is it dulling it down? numbers give whole new ways to kill
<UnFoundBug> like bubbles + reave = many explosions
<otakon> ofc
<UnFoundBug> or a min/maxed vanguard is so good it literally breaks the game
<HyperMetalLugia> Watch Korra with us :D
*HyperMetalLugia hide
<otakon> UnFoundBug: when PLAYED right and it doesn't glitch
<HyperMetalLugia> Or
<otakon> they STILL haven't fixed that glitch
<HyperMetalLugia> Record it when it comes on in your timezone
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Why is Korra suddenly popular
<HyperMetalLugia> Because Avatar fans and I dunno
<Maidwhile> Vanguard, kill thief extraordinare.
<UnFoundBug> its rather annoying, its nice trippling the score of everyone else
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe because it might be the only decent Nick show?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<UnFoundBug> Maidwhile you get as many points as you deserve from assists
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean the only decent NEW Nick show?
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 0390s Nickelodeon or GTFO.
<UnFoundBug> deal more damage get more points
<Viri> 14my aknowledge of things is so limited that sometimes I think that you are all hipsters because you always talk about stuff that I don't know
*Viri runs
<Maidwhile> The only thing game breaking about Vanguards is the ability to travel.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I just don't watch TV these days :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Nick != Nickelodeon
<drfsupercenter> 03I hardly do either, it's usually when I'm at home and bored
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> otakon you ready to play ME3 yet?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll just see what's on
<UnFoundBug> and thier infinite stun lock on all but the supers?
<drfsupercenter> 03usually end up watching Pawn Stars or Family Guy :
<drfsupercenter> 03*:
<Espeon> 06<Angel_Umbreon> I just don't watch TV these days :D
<drfsupercenter> 03*:P
<Espeon> 06this
<UnFoundBug> and their crazy AoE damage capacity
<Viri> 14I don't watch it at all, since a few years now
<Maidwhile> I don't really Vanguard, so I don't know about that.
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: can it wait after the lottery?
<Viri> 14too much trash :/
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> fine
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: I'm sorry, I like watching the lottery is all and I don't want to miss it
<Quanyails> 7Don't watch too much--that I agree with.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13THE INTERNET IS MY TV ;3
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I forgot all about it :3
<Maidwhile> I play the role of "He who is useful and yet not overbearing" as opposed to "He who must charge ALL the enemies"
<Viri> 14same xD
<otakon> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I made an appointment for Monday
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> CHARGE EVERYTHING FOREVER
<otakon> I play the role of "There is a guy behind you, I'll pick you up"
<Vinyer> what does vullaby evolve into again?
<Vinyer> super trivia :D
<Quanyails> 7Mandibuzz.
<Maidwhile> Seriously. I've no respect for the Vanguard class. It's like huntrads in wow. Press one button, score everything.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Mand- yeah
<Vinyer> okay thanks
<Vinyer> Quanyails: wins bacon
<Espeon> 06+1bacon
<Quanyails> 7Okay. O.o
<Maidwhile> Huntards* pardon my letter slip.
<UnFoundBug> every class is like that
<UnFoundBug> you get at most 3 abilities
<otakon> Maidwhile: still takes skill to play it well in Gold
<Maidwhile> Every class doesn't gave charge
<UnFoundBug> and alot of them have one of those as basically useless
<Maidwhile> have*
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I had a subway for the first time in over a year today
<Vinyer> :D
<Vinyer> welcome back to the good side
<Angel_Umbreon> 13can't believe it's been that long since I last went to Subway D:
<Vinyer> how does it feel?
<otakon> Maidwhile: every class has one skill you WILL spam, Vanguards happen to have a good spam class that launches them like a cannonball
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Still as delicious as I remember it <3
<HyperMetalLugia> Never went to subway
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I wanted to buy a footlong but I couldn't afford the extra £2
<Viri> 14same HML
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<Tovler> mmk, I'm back from Cabin in the Woods.
<drfsupercenter> 03I usually always get footlongs on flatbread
<UnFoundBug> hell even infiltrators end up spamming their alt skill (not cloak) simply to reload faster when your really gunning it
<ScootaChicken> Maidwhile: IKR
<ScootaChicken> Vanguards as such douch-
<ScootaChicken> Wait a minute...
<otakon> Tovler: how was it?
<Maidwhile> You can try and spin it so that playing Vanguard SOMEHOW takes skill to press charge and unload at close range with a shotgun, but you can't. Charge makes you invulnerable, can take you straight to the weakest enemy on the field, and move you around the area and plaid speed.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I've still made it one of my life's goals to order one of those 5ft-long subs and eat it all
<UnFoundBug> charge does NOT make you invulnerable
<Maidwhile> Actually I'm fairly sure it does.
<UnFoundBug> the single most game breaking game comes from that fact
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> it doesnt
<UnFoundBug> if you go down while charging you completely break
<ScootaChicken> Maidwhile: It doesn't, it brings your shields up to full but that's all
<otakon> Maidwhile: if it did you wouldn't die mid charge
<Tovler> Didn't really like the cast all that much in the movie… I'm still mulling it over.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: and it doesnt even bring your shields up until you get to your destination
<Maidwhile> Damn, my lack of experience with the class has invalidated my entire point. Oh wait, no it hasn't.
<otakon> Maidwhile: also, it doesn't work 100 percent of the time, I've charged Guardians and they have had NO reaction to it and melee me OUT of the charge animation
<ScootaChicken> But yeah, my main vanguard tactic is to Leeroy Jenkins in, melee shotgun and Nova people and get killed and hope people revive me.
<Maidwhile> Fact is, it's the easiest class in the game and there's nothing you can do about it.
<ScootaChicken> It's awesome.
<UnFoundBug> dont forget you have a delay as you exit the warp where the heavier enemies can easily stun lock you
<Maidwhile> You play the easy way for fast points.
<Vinyer> o-o
<Maidwhile> That's fair enough
<UnFoundBug> vanguards are good against trash, but pretty poor against anything bigger
<otakon> bye Karl
<Maidwhile> But don't try and say you aren't.
<Vinyer> Quanyails, i put a ninetales in my friends team XD
<Viri> 14one of my goals was eating something in the subway
<Vinyer> which he'll be using tomorrow
<Tovler> Also, what the name of the trope where inspirational hope music starts playing and then SUPRISE! death. As seen in Deep Blue Sea.
<Viri> 14I did it, I regret it, but worth it
<Viri> 14x3
<otakon> Tovler: not sure
<Quanyails> 7What sort of team, Vinyer? :P
<Vinyer> one centered around chandelure
<Bjornfot> Vanguards can knock back Atlases.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> yeah, considering everything large other than geth can pull you out of charge into insta death makes vanguard ssuicide against them
<otakon> Tovler: do all of the main characters die?
<UnFoundBug> Bjornfot thats been nerfed massivly
<Vinyer> chandelure, garchomp, ferrothorn, gyarados, ninetales, and something else
<Tovler> yyyyye-nope.
<ScootaChicken> Yeah, Vanguards are an unbelievably douchey class
<drfsupercenter> 03oh yeah, so Quanyails, I got Finale PrintMusic 2010 and it does indeed play fine
<ScootaChicken> which is probably why I use them
<drfsupercenter> 03(that MIDI)
<drfsupercenter> 03so as I suspected, it uses its own rendering engine
<Vinyer> oh
<Vinyer> i think hitmontop is in it as well
<Maidwhile> And yet you still lose to groups of cannibals
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Vinyer> basically
<Vinyer> chandelure
<UnFoundBug> and banshees with insta kills
<Vinyer> and 5 guys to destroy chandelure's threats
<drfsupercenter> 03now, it gave me a few choices about which instrument set to use
<UnFoundBug> and primes and hutners with stunlock
<drfsupercenter> 03was yours just at the default?
<UnFoundBug> and pyros with their flamethrowers
<ScootaChicken> They ganged up on me and I had no powers, I got gang raped
<Vinyer> ninetale's only real job is to get in there and remove rain once their rain inducer is gone
<Quanyails> 7Yes?
<Maidwhile> You must suck hard if you lose to pyros.
<ScootaChicken> Oh god I hate pyros
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> and the other instakill enemies
<Tovler> I'm really glad I saw Cabin in the Woods though.
<ScootaChicken> Charging pyros is a terrible idea
<Quanyails> 7Just sun-inducer, eh? XD
<Quanyails> 7Ah, well.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> pyros can down you in a second of fire.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> other than on bronze
<Maidwhile> I wouldn't know, they usually die before they reach me.
<Maidwhile> Or they reach me and find out what armoured knuckles taste of.
<ScootaChicken> I usually play a very close range oriented Vanguard though
<ScootaChicken> So I tend to get killed a lot.
<ScootaChicken> dohoho.
<Tovler> There's no awesome charismatic protagonist but it's definitely up there with the Evil Dead series especially towards the end.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> you can play a close range vangaurd without dieing alot....
<ScootaChicken> Yes, but you must remember that I'm a massive noob.
<Maidwhile> ^
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Ah
<ScootaChicken> Seriously, ME3 was the first game I played in like half a year
<Maidwhile> ScootaChicken lost to Marauder Shields.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> So you are the kenne of the PC group?
<ScootaChicken> Maidwhile: three times, actually.
<ScootaChicken> I got the best ending though.
<Maidwhile> You mean the one that's exactly like the other ones?
<ScootaChicken> No, the one where Marauder Shields kills me and protects me from Star Child
<Maidwhile> Sounds legit,.
<Maidwhile> Why'm I still wearing this?
<Bjornfot> nice ScootaChicken
<Meanwhile> Better.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I cant wait to see what convoluted BS Bioware comes up with to try and explain the endings in the ending dlc
<ScootaChicken> Fun fact, that look of terror is real
<UnFoundBug> inb4 they accept fan theory and its indoctrination
<ScootaChicken> They let Alan Rickman go a second earlier than they should have
<Meanwhile> I like the indoctrination theory, it makes better sense.
<ScootaChicken> UnFoundBug: I doubt it BioWare will do it.
<ScootaChicken> This ending DLC will not end well.
<UnFoundBug> almost certainly
<Meanwhile> As it stands though, they said they aren't changing the ending but are going to release epilogue type stuff didn't they?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> yeah
<ScootaChicken> Yeah, which is pointless
<Meanwhile> Pointles my ass
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> its supposed to "explain" the endings
<ScootaChicken> given that everyone's gripe with the endings was... well that they're shit.
<UnFoundBug> ScootaChicken and they took a massive dump on the 100+ hours i sunk into that characther
<Meanwhile> I don't care about magic space lasers, I just want to know what happened in the future from a nearer point than grandpa and his stupid grandson.
<UnFoundBug> and reduced it into a red/green/blue chocie
<ScootaChicken> UnFoundBug: that's a problem everyone has
<ScootaChicken> Basically the main problems are: Choices didn't matter, throws away established lore, Plot holes galore, EMS means jack shit
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> yeah, all those choices you made? didnt matter. Why were the reapers there? So nobody makes reapers, and to make more reapers.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> also star child out of nowhere
<ScootaChicken> To be honest I was expecting the ending would be like the Suicide Mission in ME2, just with fleets assigned to different duties instead of characters
<ScootaChicken> And that would have been great
<UnFoundBug> an actuall god damn fight with all the people i recruited would of been awesome
<UnFoundBug> i had SO much recruited
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<UnFoundBug> would of been nice to actually see a geth+quarian fleet take down a reaper
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> yeah, maybe have those final battles on earth change and have different forces for you depending on what you were able to gather and recruit
<UnFoundBug> you know, give me some value to saving both of them
<Meanwhile> I'm very disappointed in myself during my run of ME2 though, now that I know what screwed over my Geth Quarian alliance.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<UnFoundBug> or a wave of rachnii to clear up some of the mobs on earth
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Also, outside of the ending. That fight where you use a laser designator on a reaper. IT HAS A FUCKING LASER AND IT CANT HIT A PERSON RUNNING BAKC AND FORWARD ON A TINY LEDGE
<UnFoundBug> the asarii flagship take one for ours would of been nice, repaying the favour
<ScootaChicken> EMS meant jack shit in the end, you got practically no visual representation of it and it basically meant nothing to the ending
<UnFoundBug> RX-78-3-SweetieBot its a ship-ship weapon, not a antipersonel weapon
<UnFoundBug> but it should of just removed the entire area and bombed it from any distance
<ScootaChicken> The last level as a whole kind of sucked, it wasn't nearly as epic as it should have been.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> YOU WERE ON A TINY ASS LEDGE
<Meanwhile> The whole Geth Quarian thing made me immensely depressed.
<otakon> why?
<UnFoundBug> Meanwhile did you not have a save with legion and tali alive?
*Tovler randomly laughs thinking of Cabin in the Woods.
<Meanwhile> Because I was aiming for diplomacy, unaware that I'd invalidated it in ME2.
<Xanbreon> BNC server b0rked
<Xanbreon> :D
<Xanbreon> Not mine, so I get to laugh
<Kammerjunk> I like the Mass Effect 3 ending because hating it is so mainstream.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<otakon> Meanwhile: it's possible, but you have to save Koris
<UnFoundBug> otakon you have to save him eitehr way
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Kammerjunk does your hipsterness know no bounds?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Apparently giving Raan the data in ME2 makes it impossible.
<ScootaChicken> You didn't get a proper boss fight with, say, Harbinger, you got practically no visual representation of the ground forces you worked so hard to get and it was generally anticlimactic.
<Xanbreon> :P
<Kammerjunk> Silly question.
<drfsupercenter> 03I need to yell at Hetzner's support
<otakon> Meanwhile: oh, that. Yeah, you have to save Tali from Exile and NOT give Raan the data
<drfsupercenter> 03they haven't written back in like two days now
<UnFoundBug> you need 3 votes of support to stop the quarians attacking the geth, yours, koris and tali
<Xanbreon> Email them again
<UnFoundBug> and the geth will only succeed if legion is alive
<Meanwhile> Before I really knew what I'd pressed, the Quarians got blown to smithereens and Tali jumped off a cliff.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<otakon> ScootaChicken: given man, I was REALLY looking forward to Krogan riding Rachni into battle
<Meanwhile> I liked Tali. A lot.
<otakon> Meanwhile: ouch
<ScootaChicken> otakon: IKR
<Meanwhile> That was fucking brutal.
<Kammerjunk> Tali is awesome.
<otakon> that sucks man, it really does
<UnFoundBug> Meanwhile i know, she was my love interest in the run where she commited
<Krakass> Meanwhile, more than Trixie?
<UnFoundBug> i was like, wtf, the paragon choice doesnt even save her
<Meanwhile> I honest to god spent ten minutes trying to rationalise that it was a war and people die.
<UnFoundBug> it just makes you NEARLY save her
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I still need to see the scene where Tali kills herself.
<Meanwhile> BUT IT WAS FUCKING TALI GOD FUCKING DAMNIT.
<ScootaChicken> But guys, the endings are good because THEY ARE SO ARTSYYY
<otakon> lol
*UnFoundBug slaps ScootaChicken
*ScootaChicken puts on aviators and sniffs
<Skylands> 10drf
<otakon> "artistic integrety"
<Skylands> 10give me a hint on Draw Something
<Skylands> 10because the cheat doesn't have any choices o.o
<Kammerjunk> Krakass: That's a silly thing to ask.
<ScootaChicken> OOOOh yeeees! Look at all the symbolliiiiissssmmmm
<Meanwhile> Seriously. Not a lot makes me give a fuck about anything. But I LIKED Tali.
<ScootaChicken> My god it's so beauuutiiffful
<Kammerjunk> You know it's false.

*Meanwhile wallops ScootaChicken with a cinderblock.
<drfsupercenter> 03the word is eyepatch
<drfsupercenter> 03derp
<otakon> bc I saw that on YT, and it is crushing
<Skylands> 10bah
<Krakass> Yeah, I saw that too
<Meanwhile> Wrex's betrayal?
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: Tali committed suicide in my (non imported) save file, and it was really painful
<Krakass> That's not a renegade choice
<otakon> dear LORD I could never bring myself to do it
<ScootaChicken> oh god, killing Wrex
<Krakass> That's a dickhead/psychopath choice
<ScootaChicken> That's one douchey choice
<otakon> Meanwhile: well, Shepard betrayal ON Wrex
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I could never do anything against Wrex, Mordin, or Legion
<UnFoundBug> man mordins death was painful as well
<Meanwhile> I lost Mordin on my first runtrhough ME2 for reasons unknown.
<otakon> Renegade Shep gets MORE evil(how?) in this game.
<UnFoundBug> another paragon of NOT saving someone
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Mordin went out like a boss.
<ScootaChicken> Seeing Shepard gun down Mordin in one of the outcomes was really heartbreaking
<Meanwhile> Woah woah what?
<Kammerjunk> The only one who died on my run was Jack, and I hate Jack anyway.
<Kammerjunk> Oh wait, I think Jason died too.
<Meanwhile> Who?
<otakon> Meanwhile: he has a low survive score, he's the most likely to die if you leave him to hold the line. THat's why it's good to bring him with you on the final boss or send him with the crew back tot he ship
<ScootaChicken> Even though you can save Mordin, I think it's better to let him sacrifice himself, given that the scene is both awesome and hearbreaking
<UnFoundBug> Kammerjunk jack becomes a phantom if you dont rescue her
<otakon> Kammerjunk: Jacob
<Krakass> My only real loss was a Salarian Spectre
<Kammerjunk> Right, that's his face.
<Kammerjunk> I haven't played ME2 for a while.
<UnFoundBug> i had to kill her myself cause i didnt think the school was actually times
<ScootaChicken> Kirrahe's death made me weep.
<ScootaChicken> I LOVED KIRRAHE.
<Meanwhile> Kirrahe died for you?
<ScootaChicken> HE HELD THE GODDAMN LINE ;___;
<otakon> and Legion becomes an Assassin droid for Cerberus if you send him to them in 2 instead of reactivating him.
<Meanwhile> I had him holding the line in ME3.
<Kammerjunk> ScootaChicken: But did he hold it as well as Marauder Shields?
<ScootaChicken> Kammerjunk: He held it better.
<Kammerjunk> D:
<Meanwhile> otakon: I forget that's even an option.
<otakon> WE WILL HOLD THE LINE!
<Krakass> I was disappointed to hear that Kal'Reegar died in an email
<otakon> Before the network, there were SOLDIERS!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> WHY WOULD ANYONE HAND OVER LEGION
<ScootaChicken> I loved Kirrahe, seeing Shepard gut Kai Leng and go 'this one's for Kirrahe you son of a bitch' was one of the best parts of the game.
<UnFoundBug> to be honest, if they didnt have the ending and just went, btw guys the entire of me3 is the ending
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: bc you want credits
<UnFoundBug> i would of been happier
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: you must not have had Thane at that point.
<ScootaChicken> Even though Kai Leng was an irritating Sue
<UnFoundBug> the had so much closure on so much
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: Are you talking about Thane?
<Tovler> o.o Cabin in the Woods will have an extremely limited run.
<Kammerjunk> ScootaChicken: I think killing Kai Leng in general was the best part of the game.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: it's a little more meaningful if it's Thane
<Meanwhile> Kai Leng never met Kirrahe from my perspective, Thane got shanked.
<Kammerjunk> I HATE Kai Leng with the force of a thousand stars.
<Meanwhile> That bastard.
<otakon> Kai Leng was a douche
<UnFoundBug> oh man, thane was tough
<ScootaChicken> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: Kirrahe takes Thane's place if he died in ME2
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> oh
<Krakass> I was actually glad it was Thane, he was going to die anyway
<Meanwhile> A terminally ill Drell kick Lengs ass.
<UnFoundBug> i didnt even like thane
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Thane was too cool to let die in ME2
<otakon> bastard sent me an email, oh damn was I like "You bastard"
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Meh, I really liked Kirrahe, even though he was only a minor character in ME1
<ScootaChicken> His speech was incredible.
<otakon> me too
<otakon> good speech
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Kirrahe was cool
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> he never died for me though so
<Meanwhile> ^
<otakon> I should do that speech in the next MP game we do on the final wave
<UnFoundBug> lol
<Meanwhile> Inb4 sods law strikes you down should you.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Did you read that massive alternate endings script I sent you?
<otakon> sod's law?
<otakon> ScootaChicken: oh crap! I lost the link!
<ScootaChicken> One of my favourite things about it is that you can make an absolutely incredible speech to the Galaxy
<Meanwhile> otakon: if something bad CAN happen, it probably WILL.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Lemme go get it for you
<otakon> Meanwhile: that's Murphy's Law here in the states.

<Meanwhile> Fair enough
<Meanwhile> Anyway
<Meanwhile> What's the context of this whole betrayal of Wrex thing?
<ScootaChicken> otakon: http://social.bioware.com/forums/forum/Mass-Effect-3/Mass-Effect-3-Story-and-Campaign-Discussion-Spoilers-Allowed/Alternate-fan-made-endings-for-Mass-Effect-3-10966771-1.html all of the endings are brilliant, and the existing ones are expanded on very well.
<otakon> Meanwhile: the Salarian's offer you full aid NOT to cure the genophage. If Wrex is alive, he finds out and goes after Shepard
<Meanwhile> otakon: I know they do that, but I didn't know that happened if you agreed.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> youd also have to kill mordin to do that too
<otakon> Meanwhile: yeah, so you could potentially have to kill Mordin AND Wrex in that playthough
<Meanwhile> I mean, what kind of twonk picks some random Salarian spazzmo over Urdnot Wrex?
<ScootaChicken> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: you can persuade Mordin to help, and it's the only one in which he stays alive.
<Meanwhile> He's Wrex ffs. I'd romance him if I could.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> still
<ScootaChicken> But that's a pretty crappy outcome overall, it's a lot better to let him sacrifice himself and go out like a baws
<otakon> Meanwhile: they offer to work on the Crucible, as Garrus says, it's "ruthless calculus"
<Meanwhile> I said no and still got the Salarian fleet.
<UnFoundBug> yeah, you get a slightly smaller one though
<Meanwhile> Besides, the Crucible had Rachni. You can't really top Rachni.
<otakon> Meanwhile: well, you can if you have Kirrhe alive and find the ships
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Ill take not betraying Wrex and letting Mordin go out like a hero
<EspyLacopa|2> So, do Asari look more like humans, turians, krogan, or salarians?
<otakon> I REALLY wish we could have seen Rachni fighting the Reapers on Earth, and the Geth wrecking shop.
<Meanwhile> EspyLacopa|2: Brainwashing. Obviously.
<otakon> EspyLacopa|2: I'd say humans due to mammaries and body size/shape
<UnFoundBug> asarians are the sluts of the galaxy
<UnFoundBug> well, not sluts, but they get around
<Meanwhile> I want to see more Asari history.
<otakon> UnFoundBug: it's JUST Asari
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> asarians
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> lol

<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> asari isnt a planet silly unfound
<HyperMetalLugia> Also, sega genesis model 2 has a red "Do not remove" thingie
<UnFoundBug> RX-78-3-SweetieBot i have had 4 hours sleep since i woke up at 1 am yesterday
<HyperMetalLugia> I want to remove it ovo
<UnFoundBug> its now 10pm
<otakon> technically they would be called Thessians
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Dude, why do you sleep so little?

<UnFoundBug> oh god, actually, it was 1am the day before yesterday
<UnFoundBug> wow
<Meanwhile> That temple bit on Thessia has a lot of stuff indicating that the Asari developed a lot of their culture from Protheans, ala Egypt conspiracy theories.
<otakon> Meanwhile: eeyup The Prothean's were cultivating them to inherit the Galaxy basically, and I think Humans were a backup
<UnFoundBug> in the last 68 hours i slept for 4...
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> between that temple, and the prothean, we learn the asari are terrible
<Meanwhile> otakon: That headcanon or not?
<UnFoundBug> otakon thats referred to in the DLC
<UnFoundBug> mean*
<UnFoundBug> Meanwhile*
<UnFoundBug> man, typing fail
<Meanwhile> Yeah see I didn't buy that.
<otakon> Meanwhile: no, it's actual canon. ME proves that Prothean's meddled with humanity in it's developing stages
<otakon> Meanwhile: the prothean artefacts you can find in ME1
<Krakass> They wanted more slaves
<Meanwhile> otakon: Ignored all of ME1's side quests.
<otakon> Meanwhile: you shouldn't have, there is a GREAT scene with Conrad if you did ALL of the sidequests from ME1
<Meanwhile> Seriously I can't even properly remember ME1.
<Meanwhile> Conrad?
<otakon> Meanwhile: Conrad VErner, Shepard's No.1 fan!
<UnFoundBug> as in Verner?
<otakon> yes!
<Meanwhile> Oh that guy.
<otakon> he has a GREAT scene in ME3
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> jeez, meanwhile probably missed out on half the game
<drfsupercenter> 03so HML
<otakon> absolutely GREAT!
<UnFoundBug> RX-78-3-SweetieBot way more than half
<drfsupercenter> 03I can get either Gingerbread or ICS for my tablet
<Krakass> otakon, what scene?
<Meanwhile> In my defense, I got it like a week before ME2 was coming out.
<otakon> and it staggers me that they put in THAT brilliant scene but the ending is crap
<Krakass> His dissertation?
<otakon> yeah, and his "Did I help?"
<Meanwhile> Actually wait.
<Meanwhile> If I think about it.
<otakon> it was a great scene that was subverted and made me feel good.
<LunaTheBeloved_> But before I go....
<UnFoundBug> otakon what bout his not actually having a wife
<Meanwhile> I had a renegade Engineer that I did a lot of the side stuff on, but it was mostly shit I didn't care about.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I remember really liking the scene with conrad but I cannot remember what happened in it >_>
<UnFoundBug> and instead having a shep shrine
<otakon> UnFoundBug: he was divorced
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna try Gingerbread first just so I don't brick it again
*LunaTheBeloved_ steals Meanwhile's legs
<Meanwhile> Oi
<LunaTheBeloved_> Heheh
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: you meet him on the Citadel, finding out he's "working" for Cerberus
<LunaTheBeloved_> Gotta go!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> oh yeah
<otakon> bye LunaTheBeloved_ take care dear!
<Meanwhile> Nooooo ;n;
<otakon> and LEAVE Meanwhile's LEGS!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> meanwhile doesnt need his legs
<otakon> forever!
*LunaTheBeloved_ feels bad and gives Meanwhiled's legs back
*Meanwhile squees.
<LunaTheBeloved_> Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> hes just gonna be on bronystate all day
<otakon> lol
*Meanwhile looks at one of his legs.
<Meanwhile> You know what, you can have this one.
<LunaTheBeloved_> You sure?
<Meanwhile> Absolutely.
<otakon> XD
<Meanwhile> If I get a cane, I can act like House.
<UnFoundBug> this chat became very wierd as i started reading the thermal clip canon
<LunaTheBeloved_> :)
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Dr. Meanwhile, ND
*Meanwhile hands LunaTheBeloved_ his leg.
*LunaTheBeloved_ holds the leg
<Krakass> Thermal clips annoy me so much.
<LunaTheBeloved_> I will treasure it always
<Krakass> Why can't the guns fire at a slower rate without one?
<UnFoundBug> apparently they are a geth technology
<Meanwhile> Try not to break it :P
*LunaTheBeloved_ hugs Meanwhile
*Meanwhile hugs LunaTheBeloved_ back.
<LunaTheBeloved_> I'm not gonna make any promises
<ScootaChicken> But the question is Meanwhile, can you do an American accent like Hugh Laurie?
<Krakass> Wow, LunaTheBeloved_ really is beloved.
<UnFoundBug> Krakass becaue mass effect shielding is designed to combat high damage rounds at a low RoF
<LunaTheBeloved_> Krakass, you got that right
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: Probably not. But why would I want to when I have this voice.
<UnFoundBug> thermal clips are there to allow guns to fire large amounts of rounds to overwhelm shields
<UnFoundBug> though to accomodate this they had to remove the internal cooling mechanisms
<LunaTheBeloved_> Cya y'all letter tonight if you're still on
<Meanwhile> Do people REALLY think about why they use thermal clips in ME2 onwards?
<UnFoundBug> yes
<UnFoundBug> i still prefer the old system
<Meanwhile> Maybe, maybe not. Will see how much tea I can down LunaTheBeloved_.
<Krakass> It's a codex entry
<Krakass> The old system was much better.
<Meanwhile> Figures. I ignored the codex.
<ScootaChicken> Y'know what BioWare should do?
<Meanwhile> Well, most of it anyway
<UnFoundBug> man Meanwhile you really didnt actually play the game did you
<Krakass> UnFoundBug, I was thinking the same thing.
<otakon> I like the old codex and journal better bc it WORKED
<Meanwhile> I wanted to play the story, I wanted to play Shepard. I didn't want to play librarian.
<ScootaChicken> Re release all 3 ME games when the next gen of consoles come around, all of them with ME3's updated gameplay as well as somewhat remade levels.
<ScootaChicken> That would be awesome.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: and working journals, it would be good
<ScootaChicken> Oh, and it would give ME3 better endings.
<otakon> OFC!
<Krakass> I got soo pissed at the journal. It would open to the electrical schematics no matter what.
<Meanwhile> I read some of the codex bits that interested me, like Brutes, Banshees, harvesters, phantoms, Admiral Hacket and so forth
<UnFoundBug> ScootaChicken so basically just update me1
<ScootaChicken> otakon: The journals were great in ME2, I don't see why they would go back on taht in ME3
<UnFoundBug> very little changed between 2 and 3
<ScootaChicken> *that
<Meanwhile> But honest to god I do not give a fuck about the inner workings of the guns
<UnFoundBug> could of done SO much more
<Krakass> Halfway through the game, that's a lot of scrolling
<Meanwhile> I point them and the thing I'm poiting at dies. That's good enough for me.
<ScootaChicken> UnFoundBug: and give ME2 rolling and shiz
<UnFoundBug> but nooo consoles are too limted and we cant have the PCs looking ncier now can we
<ScootaChicken> but you know what would have been an awesome thing?
<Krakass> I liked ME1 grenades
<UnFoundBug> looks exactly the bucking same on the pc
<Meanwhile> I found the grenades kinda unwieldy.
<ScootaChicken> For light melee attacks you slash your omniblade, for heavy melee you do the same stabby thing as is in the game
<ScootaChicken> As opposed to just swinging your weapon
<ScootaChicken> That would have been really cool
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> ME1 grenades were a cool looking thing, but mostlly useless
<ScootaChicken> There were grenades in ME1?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> exactly
<Meanwhile> Light melee is meant to be fast, you expose your defense by drawing the omni blade, which is why it hits like a cannon.
<ScootaChicken> I don't think I used a single one in my entire playthrough...
<otakon> Krakass: bug, plus it NEVER updates quests
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: you killed all the Feros colonists?
<RAWRity> alright, here we go
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: oh yeah, that part
<otakon> ScootaChicken: yeah, they were VERY important in the Feros mission
<Meanwhile> Goon.
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: crossing our finers
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> LOTTO TIEM
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> BIG MOONEH
<ScootaChicken> *fingers
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> DOSH
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: hey, we got 3 people doing it, better chance than most.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> GET HYPE
<Meanwhile> Need a moment to start typing "Where was Gondor" in mane chat
<UnFoundBug> right time for lotto
<Hype> BOOM
<Hype> YOU PINGED!?
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: If it does get picked it will be the ultimate 'dis gon b gud' moment in BronyState history.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> oh, sorry hype
<Meanwhile> If it does, I'm not coming to it.
<Hype> No, no. I needed a reminder for the lotto, haha
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> If it does, I will pop out the chat and just watc hthat
<Meanwhile> Though given the timing I may not be anyway.
<RAWRity> my goal is to have the lowest BMN attendance record
<Meanwhile> Inb4 only mods show up.
<ScootaChicken> Our goal RAWRity.
<ScootaChicken> Our goal.
<Hype> Meanwhile
<RAWRity> oh, if at all possible, I'll show up to BOTH screenings
<Meanwhile> Wrex.
<Meanwhile> I mean, Hype.
<Krakass> Did you guys vote for Baraka too?
<Hype> Can anyone think of any celebrities with the initials AB?
<Krakass> Alton Brown'
<LordDerpington> Alan Bennett
<RAWRity> Hype: antonio banderas
<otakon> Adrian Brody?
<Hype> Antonio Banderas it is
<Hype> Thanks!
<Meanwhile> Adrian, yeah him
<otakon> lol
<EspyLacopa|2> oh boy oh boy
<UnFoundBug> 141 entrants, 0.7% of winning
<Meanwhile> Dat math
*EspyLacopa|2 hopes for Grave of the Fireflies
<otakon> multiply that by 4 UnFoundBug
<otakon> one time for each catergory
<ScootaChicken> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
<RAWRity> awww
<otakon> you have FOUR 0.7%'s of winning
<UnFoundBug> well its actually just above 4 times
<Meanwhile> Thank fuck
<RAWRity> oh well, always next week
<UnFoundBug> cause its 1/141 + 1/140 + 1/139 + 1/138
<otakon> who's WinRarity?
<Meanwhile> Buried?
<ScootaChicken> haven't you noticed how people who we never see keep winning
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I thought he said RAWRity for a second there
<otakon> UnFoundBug: oh, you are right, my math fail
<RAWRity> the Ryan Reynolds in a box movie?
<LordDerpington> Also there are sometimes disqualifications for ineligible picks, etc.
<ScootaChicken> like WinRarity and Octavias_Pride
<otakon> Buried? I have NEVER heard of that before, sounds like a troll movie
<Meanwhile> Ryan Reynolds. Was he Green Lantern?
<Krakass> I think I need more email address so I can get more newsletters.
<LordDerpington> Buried's alright.
<ScootaChicken> Oh that film
<ScootaChicken> is it the one with Ryan Reynolds?
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: yes, unfortunately
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: yes
<Meanwhile> Ah, I like him.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: you silly filly.
<Meanwhile> Though tbh, I never actually saw GL. It was just what came to mind,.
<Krakass> Not me either.
<Bjornfot> SO... people are using fake emails to get more votes?
<Meanwhile> Lasharus!
<Krakass> Darn
<ScootaChicken> FFFFF-
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: it's terrible
<ScootaChicken> I never win ;__;
<Bjornfot> We should re-implement that system when you has to be in the chat at the moment of the drawing to win.
<Krakass> Ooh, not bad.
<RAWRity> AWWWW YEAH
<LordDerpington> Another Mel Brooks, nice.
<UnFoundBug> awww yeah
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I liked the Green Lantern movie....
<EspyLacopa> Nice, History of the World.
<ScootaChicken> YEEEEEEAAAAAAH
<UnFoundBug> not me, but same pic as me
<EspyLacopa> I'm still waiting for Part 2 of that movie.
<Meanwhile> I have no idea what that pic is but it's Mel Brooks. So it must be good.
<Meanwhile> Pic?
<Meanwhile> film*
<Krakass> It already came out, EspyLacopa it was called Space Balls
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: the question is, if we pick JB as A, will they allow it?
<Meanwhile> No.
<otakon> it's Mel Brooks, it's FUNNY
<ScootaChicken> Because it's IMBD score is really low
<Meanwhile> Nor will they as B.
<Meanwhile> Because frankly, fuck you.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: probably on money alone
<otakon> yes
<Krakass> JB?
<Tovler> phew. I was afraid the fact that I didn't pick Bieber would be revealed.
<ScootaChicken> Krakass: Justin Bieber's Never Say Never
<Krakass> Oh got
<Krakass> d
<Meanwhile> Jaketehsnake won. Wait
<Meanwhile> Didn't he win last week?
<RAWRity> that he did
<UnFoundBug> grats Jaketehsnake on winning ep

<ScootaChicken> I've never won anything ;_______;
<Jaketehsnake> IM SORRY!
<Jaketehsnake> I DIDN't MEAN TO!
<Jaketehsnake> AUGH
<Meanwhile> Jake is best hax.
<ScootaChicken> Can someone PM a mod and tell them Jake won last week?
<Meanwhile> I did
<Krakass> Poor Gilda, she doesn't get enough airtime
<LordDerpington> Yay, Cider.
<Meanwhile> Dat cider.
<Tovler> Is there a 1 month limit for winning episodes?
<ScootaChicken> RIGGED.
<ScootaChicken> RIIIIIGED/
<Skylands> 10Mmmcookies
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<RAWRity> Tovler: for everything.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> has there been a week where a mod hasnt won one of them?
<HyperMetalLugia> hii
<Xanbreon> GB is pretty horrid on tablets, HC or ICS all the way
<Meanwhile> Probably.
<RAWRity> If you win for a category, it's a month before you can win it again.
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no HC
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<ScootaChicken> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: occasionally
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried ICS and bricked it >_>
<EspyLacopa> mmm, cider

<Krakass> Darn, I think I was 141
<otakon> Shizuka! YOU WON!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> cause it doesnt seem like it...
<ScootaChicken> Remember when Luna won twice in one lottery?
<drfsupercenter> 03because the bootloader was for GB
<otakon> Jaketehsnake: yo9u won too!
<ScootaChicken> that was amusing
<RAWRity> otakon: he won, but it didn't count
<UnFoundBug> so many skips
<otakon> ScootaChicken: yes, and she got us good with the LONGEST BOLLYWOOD MOVIE that kicked ass in the last 30 minutes
<RAWRity> Dat 8
<Jaketehsnake> I won twice! Huzzah
<drfsupercenter> 03so Xanbreon, Hetzner wrote back like "please do it as a support ticket" >_>
<RAWRity> oh hey, Dragonshy. Haven't seen that 4 times on here...
<Hype> Ugh
<Hype> Dragonshy, I've seen that way too often
<Xanbreon> You wherent going though the ticket system?
<Meanwhile> Thing is, it's obviously not rigged, but people are paranoid.
<Hype> too much*
<drfsupercenter> 03I emailed them directly
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03there was a form on their page
<drfsupercenter> 03for support
<drfsupercenter> 03before I bought the server
<Jaketehsnake> This is why I don't want to win. People get pissed at me becuase they have seen that ep too many times
<Xanbreon> Well now you have it submit tickets
<Dken2021> afternoon everyone

<EspyLacopa> Poor Wrek got kicked.
<RAWRity> you'll love it!
<otakon> brb biobreak needed badly
<RAWRity> Nudist Colony of the Dead, it's a horror/comedy spoof that's also a MUSICAL! :d
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> time to get toast
<Dken2021> sounds like funny
<Krakass> With a name like that I'd have thought porn.
<UnFoundBug> I think i might go for scary movie
<RAWRity> eenope.
*Tovler still laughs thinking of Cabin in the Woods.
<ScootaChicken> HAHA NINJA'D YOU MEANWHILE
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: not on my screen.
<otakon> Tovler: is it that funny?
<UnFoundBug> or monty python and now for something completely different
<UnFoundBug> which should i stick with?
<otakon> Tovler: I thought it had some ......well situations that were on the dark side there.
<RAWRity> UnFoundBug: Nudist Colony of the Dead
<Tovler> Did anyone else think of the brawl in Beauty and the Beast during that one scene?
<otakon> okay, brb
<RAWRity> or Birdemic
<otakon> didn't see it yet, read the synopsis
<RAWRity> birdemic would be good too
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Birdemic is fantastic
<Dken2021> oh yea, did they show the edited version of last roundup?
<RAWRity> Dken2021: eeyup
<Tovler> I can't watch Birdemic without Rifftrax.
<RAWRity> much rage was had in the chat
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/TNJ3m.jpg
<Dken2021> I'm guessing it was the bizarro version of the first time we heard her talk?
<ScootaChicken> Dken2021: pretty much
<RAWRity> Dken2021: eeyup. Wish somebody had been recording it.
<Tovler> I want to see the upload reaction to Debra, the clumsy but loveable pegasus.
<RAWRity> ooh! ooh! Great idea for a movie night: Breaking Dawn Part 1 for A, Vampires Suck for B
<Yahooz> daw I didnt wint he lottery again :/
<Dken2021> don't worry, I didn't win either
<Hype> Question guys!
<Hype> The Gondor reference
<Yahooz> yes?
<RAWRity> answer guy
<Hype> Can someone explain it?
<Tovler> Vampires Suck made more money than Scott Pilgrim, so no.
<Dken2021> explain what?
<Yahooz> Where was Gondor when we explained it?
<Hype> On the moon
<RAWRity> Hype: there's a line in Return of the King that goes "Where was gondor when ...." and the chat turned it into a meme
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: One thing at a time, JB first, we'll deal with others later

<Tovler> One does not simply explain the Where Was Gondor meme.
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: oh I know, just bringing up some ideas.
<Hype> Thanks Rawrity
<RAWRity> Tovler: I just did.
<Yahooz> LoveFace
*Dken2021 now knows the origin of gondor
<otakon> Loveface?
<ScootaChicken> Does anyone remember Hard Rock Zombies?
<otakon> yes
<ScootaChicken> that was brilliant
<RAWRity> ooh! ooh! The Hunger Games for A, Battle Royale for B
<otakon> dear god, how could I forget that crap
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: vaguely
<otakon> RAWRity: zombie werewolf grandma
<otakon> that is all
<Dken2021> wut
<otakon> you heard me
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when the intermission lasted long enough for me to go grab some chocolate and a cup of tea?
<otakon> lol
<UnFoundBug> RAWRity thats not nice, then everyone who thought hunger games was a good idea will have their entire ideals destroyed by the epicness of the original
<RAWRity> we can see white kids kill eachother with shaky cam, then Japanese kids kill eachother with every weapon imaginable.
<Tovler> Kick Ass for A. Super for B.
<otakon> that's Pinkies face from when she was going "I'm about to be BRILLIANT!"
<RAWRity> UnFoundBug: >original
<RAWRity> HA
<otakon> with Twi's colors and mane
<otakon> a'www
<UnFoundBug> hungergames is just a lame westernised version
<Meanwhile> otakon: You don't say.jpeg

<RAWRity> face it, the "People in an arena killing eachother" premise is practically its own Genre. It'd be like calling Harry Potter a rip off of Lord of the Rings because they both have magic.

<ScootaChicken> Krakass: They are great though, aren't they?
<Krakass> Indeed they are.
<Krakass> Even the crappy ones were good for what they were.
<ScootaChicken> The crappy ones were good because they explained pretty much everything
<Krakass> They were good, the just weren't endings I'd want.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Aaaahhhh Zombies !! * run to the hills*
<Jaketehsnake> I don't know, Maybe Left 4 Dead. Maybe TF2. Whatever
<Gumri> What is the game about zombies that is really good?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Gumri: theres a couple of those
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'll play l4d2 if you want
<Jaketehsnake> Left 4 Dead is great. Killing floor has different mechanics, but is till godd
<Gumri> It uses the same engine as L4D but it is not made by valve
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but i'm going to take a shower first so brb
<Jaketehsnake> Shower well, T
<Krakass> Also, Dead Island from what I've heard.
<Gumri> Zombie panic i think it's called
<Gumri> It is also free
<Jaketehsnake> Krakass, I have never played Dead Island. Can't review
<Krakass> Zombie Panic needs DLC set at a disco.

<Gumri> In the UK you can have drinks at 14 as long as an adult buys them for you.
<Gumri> True story
<Krakass> In the US we can have drinks at 14 if an adult buys them for us and doesn't get arrested before giving them away.

<UnFoundBug> you just can't BUY it for till an age, or buy it FOR someone else
<UnFoundBug> so if its bought for yourself and given to them, its technically fine
<Krakass> I think we need to lower the drinking age in the US to 18 but that will never happen as long as highway funds are tied to drinking age.

<UnFoundBug> ',' 'u' '$' and 't'
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> By the end of the day Im gonna have a pile of burning keyboards in the front yard
<UnFoundBug> all with 3 letters missing
<UnFoundBug> 'k','e' and 'n'
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> lol
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> so otakon, you finally stop playing?
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> just got back RX-78-3-SweetieBot
<otakon> I feel.......tired for some reason
<Gumri> Because it is late
<otakon> maybe
<otakon> I don't know, maybe it's bc my life has stalled out atm
<otakon> I've applied to dozens of places, and even though I've gotten a couple of interviews not a SINGLE follow up
<otakon> and it's just disheartening
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> get anything thats not crap?
<Gumri> I know someone who got about 10 interviews and then nothing
<Krakass> Have you sent a thank you a week after your interview as a prod?
<otakon> in what? my PSP?
<Gumri> haha
<otakon> Krakass: I called them 3-4 times until I ran out of minutes, they WERE supposed to call me back for training
<otakon> they never did
<Krakass> That sucks
<Gumri> How long has it been?
<otakon> a month
<Krakass> Show up and just start working.
<otakon> lol they can arrest you for that you know
<otakon> trespassing
<Krakass> I did that with a college class once
<Krakass> Just kept showing up till the professor finally relented.
<otakon> well, college and a place of business are a little different
<otakon> I'm going to start filling out applications for places I already did tomorrow, since the damn things run out over 60 days
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> my face hurts.
<Gumri> :(
<otakon> why the hurt face RX?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> to much insanity rage laughing
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> too*
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> XD
<Krakass> Add the O to the list
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> add all the keys
<Gumri> What?
<Krakass> Exactly

<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> main chat has turned into a portal RP
<Ascendant> I don't suppose Feather has been active on here
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> it scares me
<Gumri> lol i can see everyone's name in here change to portal stuff
<UnFoundBug> poor rx
<Skylands> 10Nope
*BronyState comforts RX-78-3-SweetieBot
<SheenaFox> nope
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Wat.
<UnFoundBug> o.0
*Ascendant sighs
<Skylands> 10April 10 last seen
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Im confused...
<Ascendant> I seriously
<UnFoundBug> about?
<Gumri> What's up
<BronyState> Whats up?
<Ascendant> don't want to do this, but :|
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> why I heard a ping
<Ascendant> Though
<SheenaFox> ?
<Ascendant> I'm currently too lazy to do anything
<Krakass> Because you were comforted.
<Ascendant> it's 10:30am and I just woke up
<Ascendant> so
<Skylands> 10Demod
<SheenaFox> oh
<Skylands> 10@ Sheena
<Gumri> "Bronystate comforts RX-78-3-SweetieBot"
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> ah
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> the chat froze for a bit and clear previous messages
<Ascendant> I'm gonna go game until 2am
<Gumri> oh
<Ascendant> then go to bed
<Ascendant> and then do that for the next few days
<BronyState> thats a derp and a half
<Ascendant> until I'm too busy to do anything
<Ascendant> :{D
<Gumri> It is so annoying when the chat freezes
<Krakass> I like using xchat.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I wish flash wasnt so unstable
<Krakass> Haven't had it derp on me yet.
<Gumri> hey hey I am using Xchat :D
<BronyState> i use either xChat or IceChat
<Krakass> You use the on page chat?
<BronyState> i prefer Ice, but it crashes when the rooms get too busy
<Krakass> RX-78-3-SweetieBot, try the ajax version
<Krakass> It doesn't use flash so it should be more stable.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I usually use the page chat since I dont feel like bothering with external IRC programs most of the time
<Gumri> Xchat just came with this Linux so i just thought i would use it
<Krakass> Most stablest
<BronyState> welcome back
<Gumri> point proven :D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> woah, this looks different
<UnFoundBug> welcome back RX-78-SweetieBot
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh, is there a way to make it not show join and quit messages?
<Gumri> I wish there was
<BronyState> what client you using?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the ajax one
<Krakass> Menu top left
<Krakass> Then options
<Krakass> Scroll down Hid JOINS/PARTS/QUITS
<Krakass> hide*
<BronyState> ahh Krakass beat me too it
<Krakass> Gumri you can hid it in xchat as well
<Gumri> How??
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ah, much better
<Krakass> Right click the name of the room
<Krakass> Settings: Hide Join/Part messages
<Gumri> aha yep ok thanks
*drfsupercenter sighs
<drfsupercenter> 03is Advil supposed to make you tired?
<drfsupercenter> 03also for some reason my headache isn't going away, I've prolly taken about 4x the recommended dosage now x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> Why would you do that.
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's children's Advil
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't take pills.
<drfsupercenter> 03or, well, I can if I chew them
<drfsupercenter> 03but that basically ruins the effect
<drfsupercenter> 03so I try to get liquid medicine if possible
<SheenaFox> 4x the recommended dosage for you, or for children lol
<Ascendant> drfffffffffff
<RX-78-SweetieBot> whoever suggested switching to this thing thank you, its so much better than the default thing
<drfsupercenter> 03SheenaFox, for children
<drfsupercenter> 03but like
<drfsupercenter> 03it's based on weight
<Gumri> it is
<drfsupercenter> 03the highest weight they have (one dose cup) is like a little under half of mine
<Ascendant> brb rebooting into windows, I'll still be on IRC on my craptop
<drfsupercenter> 03so I just filled the thing twice
<drfsupercenter> 03and then did that again >_>
<Skylands> 10Why
<Skylands> 10can't you swallow pills
<drfsupercenter> 03I just can't
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried once with some M&Ms and almost choked on them
<BronyState> RX-78-SweetieBot, why dont you get an external client?
<Skylands> 10Small throat? inb4 that's what she said
<drfsupercenter> 03gag reflexes, prolly, I tend to choke on almost anything
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Skylands> 10Well, I used to be the same, but because I was SCARED to swallow them
<Skylands> 10don't ask why
<drfsupercenter> 03The dentist was like "Your parents probably won't tell you this, but you have a really small mouth"
<Gumri> that is what RX-78-SweetieBot just did :D
<drfsupercenter> 03yay being a freak of nature :D
*drfsupercenter hides
<Skylands> 10:P
<BronyState> no, hes just using another online chat
<drfsupercenter> 03they basically can't "fix" my jaw
<drfsupercenter> 03originally I was going to need jaw surgery
<RX-78-SweetieBot> cause I dont feel like dealing with it. I only use one right now if Im playing a game on PC
<HyperMetalLugia> What happened to it O.o
<Gumri> oooooooh?
<otakon> I'm back

<HyperMetalLugia> Okaygood.
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually want to take a "staged" picture of me, it'll be quite funny
<otakon> it's been just over six months since I lost my last one through no fault of my own
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm not doing it until I get a chance to shave XD
<Skylands> 10I'm so glad I am not male

<drfsupercenter> 03at least
<BronyState> SB also likes a) not sleeping b) being naked
<drfsupercenter> 03what they call "hairy digits"
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate having it, but nothing I can do
<Gumri> heh i know a guy who spells thought like that just to piss people off
<drfsupercenter> 03basically where hair grows on the back of my hands
<Skylands> 10Only certain people can pull of mustaches/beards
<Skylands> 10off
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to think the moustache looked good but then I realized it looked silly
<drfsupercenter> 03alright, time to take a really ugly photo LOL
<Skylands> 10I like how you point out my UK spellings
<Krakass> Gumri, the majority of mane chat?
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 "you mean like any of them?"
<Skylands> 10then you spell it like moustaches
<drfsupercenter> 03moustache is the proper spelling o.o

<Skylands> 10Demoncat?
<drfsupercenter> 03cuz I only get it for 2 hours
<drfsupercenter> 03that far right thing above your bed, LOL
<Ascendant> Ah
<Skylands> 10oh, my pet cat
<Ascendant> Well
<Ascendant> I'm on my craptop atm
<Ascendant> since I'm gaming on my other laptop
<Ascendant> so
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL having more than one laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03I've got several desktops, jus tone laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03which is broken ATM :/
<Ascendant> I actually have 3
<Ascendant> but one is broken
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ascendant> and I have 2 desktops, and one sitting in the garage
<Ascendant> 3 desktops
<drfsupercenter> 03my laptop "works", but the hard drive broke
<Ascendant> 2 in my room and one in the garage
<drfsupercenter> 03and HItachi does slow RMAs
<Ascendant> yeah same with mine
<Ascendant> for some reason
<drfsupercenter> 03and the hinge is falling apart again
<Ascendant> I can't even liveboot
<Ascendant> it's that dead
<drfsupercenter> 03well I can do that
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm dbanning right now
<otakon> and then chat died

<drfsupercenter> 03literally ONLY the hard drive is broken
<drfsupercenter> 03but like
<Yahooz> regulars room always dies eventually
<RX-78-SweetieBot> it des that
<Ascendant> well
<RX-78-SweetieBot> DOES
<RX-78-SweetieBot> *
<Ascendant> that's the same with mine
<drfsupercenter> 03the hinge
<drfsupercenter> 03is starting to go
<Ascendant> but it shouldn't affect live booting
<drfsupercenter> 03AGAIN
<drfsupercenter> 03I already paid them to fix it twivce
<Ascendant> same
<drfsupercenter> 03*twice
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm pouring more money in repairs
<drfsupercenter> 03than if I just bought a new one
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03so I need to call them and start yelling
<Krakass> O was already on the list.
<drfsupercenter> 03and be like FIX IT FOR FREE YOU INCOMPETENT PEOPLE
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> okay but yeah
<Ascendant> any idea why a laptop won't live boot?
<drfsupercenter> 03bad RAM possibly
<Ascendant> I finally managed to get it past the hard disk error
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd say the CPU but if you get a BIOS at all, the CPU works
<Ascendant> yeah, that's what I was thinking
<Ascendant> Well
<Ascendant> normally, the laptop derps on "Non-system disk or disk error"
<Ascendant> And memchecks come up fine
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Ascendant> so I'm utterly confused
<drfsupercenter> 03what did you try livebooting from, CD or flash drive?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> So is key to destroy from all keyboards gonna by my thing now?
<Ascendant> Both
<RX-78-SweetieBot> keys*
<drfsupercenter> 03interesting
<Ascendant> even hirons doesn't work
<drfsupercenter> 03hirons?
<drfsupercenter> 03also how did you memcheck if you can't liveboot o.o
<Ascendant> BIOS
<drfsupercenter> 03the BIOS has that built in?
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<drfsupercenter> 03mine doesn't XD
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but mine was also barebones
<Ascendant> it's weird though
<Ascendant> I should theoretically be able to live boot
<drfsupercenter> 03what all did you try livebooting from

<Drake> 04DFO
<Drake> 04what
<Ascendant> Dungeon Fighters Online
<Ascendant> Telume somehow prodded me into playing it
<Drake> 04y
*Ascendant shrugs
<Ascendant> I want someone to play with XD
<drfsupercenter> 03oh yay
<drfsupercenter> 03I got the LARA console
<Ascendant> and you'll like the sprites
<Drake> 04I have art that needs finishing today
<drfsupercenter> 03time to setup Windows then
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> have fun drf
<Ascendant> don't forget to install VNC :{D
*Ascendant goes back to being bored
<drfsupercenter> 03of course
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll do teamviewer first though
<Ascendant> tightvnc
<Ascendant> not realvnc
<Ascendant> >|
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<Ascendant> realvnc is a laggy piece of crap
<drfsupercenter> 03RealVNC Enterprise works better
<Ascendant> just run it on a diff port or something
<drfsupercenter> 03IMHO
<Ascendant> run your realvnc on the standard VNC
<Ascendant> and I'll run mine on my random port
<drfsupercenter> 03that's stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't want two
<Ascendant> you use teamviewer though :|
<drfsupercenter> 03but I want VNC for emergencies
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03especially since this won't be a VM so I have no VM console to force reboot if needed
<Ascendant> yeah then tightvnc is fine o_O since you're not using it a lot
<Ascendant> but it's up to you
<Ascendant> I can use whatever
<Ascendant> I'll probably won't be using it for anything other than scriptbot
<Ascendant> since SSH works for linux
<Ascendant> using VNC for linux is stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL MSI
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03Array mirror is RAID1, right?
<Krakass> Soooo many stupid people on mane chat.
<Yahooz> ikr
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04did you finish Jedi Starfighter?
<drfsupercenter> 03wow, this is going really slowly
<drfsupercenter> 03for loading files
<drfsupercenter> 03must be one really crappy flash drive they put the ISO on
<RX-78-SweetieBot> doesnt it just make you want to drain the blood from their skulls? ^_^
<otakon> will you get off of that
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Ive only mentioned it twice....

<Krakass> Buried was A
<LunaTheBeloved> Okay....never heard of it....
<LunaTheBeloved> Cool, thanks
<LunaTheBeloved> Two movies I don't know....
<Krakass> And then my browser commited seppeku
<Krakass> History is older but funny.
<LunaTheBeloved> Is it a "so bad it's funny" or just funny?
<drfsupercenter> 03...it isn't detecting the hard drive
<Krakass> Plan old funny
<Krakass> Plain*
<LunaTheBeloved> Yay!
*LunaTheBeloved watches the tumbleweed roll through chat
<RX-78-SweetieBot> rollin rollin rollin~
<Krakass> I actually saw a real tumbleweed last summer
<Krakass> It was inspirational.
<Krakass> :-$
<LunaTheBeloved> I bet
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<LunaTheBeloved> How did tha tumble weed, make you feel?
<Krakass> It made me think "What am I still doing in this state?"

<Krakass> Who knows anymore.
<Krakass> Wait, when did you turn into a psychiatrist?
<LunaTheBeloved> Hey, who's the ona asking the questions? Me

<Krakass> Ok, now you're ELIZA.

<Krakass> This is a chat room
<Krakass> On the internet
<LunaTheBeloved> Or is it!?
<LunaTheBeloved> Dun dun duuuuuun
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh, this isn't working
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a third-party RAID controller and Windows isn't seeing it x.x
<LunaTheBeloved> I've had too much coffee....
<RX-78-SweetieBot> LunaTheBeloved: is a silly filly
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ugh, add the backspace key to the list...
<Krakass> Chatception?
<LunaTheBeloved> I'm silly?
<Krakass> So I have a coupon for a free domino's artisan pizza. Spinach & Feta or Chicken Carbonara?
<Krakass> Also, no "Yuck that's cardboard" comments.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> One day I will go back in time to remove the movie inception from existance so we dont get any ___ception jokes. Instead we will get more xibit jokes
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and yes you are LunaTheBeloved
<Krakass> xibitception?
<LunaTheBeloved> Spinach and Feta
<Krakass> I heard you like xibit, so I put xibit in xibit so you could something while you something.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> YO DAWG I HERD YOU LIKE INCEPTION SO I PUT XIBIT IN YOUR INCEPTION SO YOU CAN MEME WHILE YOU MEME

<Krakass> I was leaning that way because I love spinach but the chicken carbonara has bacon. And my veins aren't fully clogged yet.
<LunaTheBeloved> Bacon is good....
<LunaTheBeloved> It's up to you
<Yahooz> Lets see what LC says
<Skylands> 10!check wiki.puella-magi.net
<Skylands> 10Pfft fine
<junh1024-XD> up desu
<Skylands> 10Is it?
<junh1024-XD> Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie Set For Autumn 2012
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Skylands> 10Not for me
<Drake> 04Weird
<junh1024-XD> Titles are The Beginning Story (始まりの物語) and The Everlasting Story (永遠の物語).
<junh1024-XD> Both movie set for Autumn 2012. For more information please see official website
<LunaTheBeloved> Remember though....it's bacon....from Domino's....
<Krakass> Hmm, what will Lord Bacon decide?
<Skylands> 10MBAM is blocking it
<Skylands> 10and MBAM is blocking a ton of other things
<Skylands> 10like
<Skylands> 10whenever I get on TST
<drfsupercenter> 03you can whitelkist stuff
<Skylands> 10It block access to something or another
<drfsupercenter> 03*whitelist
<drfsupercenter> 03wb
<Skylands> 10drf, how do
<Krakass> So much maiding
<Skylands> 10Ignore List > add > ?
<drfsupercenter> 03it should show a little popup when it blocks something
<Skylands> 10It brings me to files
<drfsupercenter> 03right click and say add to ignore
<drfsupercenter> 03or just right click and uncheck "website blocking "
<Skylands> 10Not helping
<Skylands> 10I right clicked the pop-up, it disappeared
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's not going to take effect right away
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03right click the tray icon
<Krakass> Well I've always been one to follow a crowd.
<Maidass> Hmm, I don't think that sounds right
<LunaTheMaid> Heheh....Maidass
<Skylands> 10k
<Skylands> 10inb4 won't be in effect until after I reboot
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<drfsupercenter> 03but it takes like 2-3 minutes
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh god more maids
<Skylands> 10actually
<Skylands> 10both MBAM and Chrome
<LunaTheMaid> We will rule the world!!
<LunaTheMaid> AHAHAHA!
<Skylands> 10http://i.imgur.com/h552h.png
<Skylands> 10inb4 get Firefox
<Skylands> 10instant no :P
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03it seems to do that for LL too, where it just blocks random websites
<drfsupercenter> 03it works fine here though
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<Skylands> 10oh
<HyperMetalLugia> no
<junh1024-XD> i don't MBAM \o/
<Skylands> 10AdBlock addon was blocking it
<HyperMetalLugia> silly mbam
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Skylands> 10LOLWAT
<drfsupercenter> 03This is why Ad Muncher FTW
<Skylands> 10because a Puella Magi wiki is totally a full advertising website
<Drake> 04o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> it isn't adblocker's
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<HyperMetalLugia> it is mbam.
<drfsupercenter> 03they're called false positives
<HyperMetalLugia> simple as that
<drfsupercenter> 03and now
<drfsupercenter> 03-w
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the two of them together
<drfsupercenter> 03Ad Muncher is fine on its own but it seems to conflict with MBAM's blocking
<drfsupercenter> 03as they both try to block the same stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03which causes the world to explode
<Skylands> 10no
<Skylands> 10I turned off AdBlocker and it suddenly worked
<Skylands> 10so
<[MAID]Yahooz> all teh maids!
<Skylands> 10BOTH things were an issue
<drfsupercenter> 03read what I said
<drfsupercenter> 03"the two of them together"
<Skylands> 10HML just can't admit that Chrome isn't always the best
<Skylands> 10drf
<Skylands> 10that's what I told him elsewhere
<LunaTheMaid> We will rid the world of all it's filth and scum!
<Drake> 04XD
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03LL uses IE, you use Chrome, both have adblocker + MBAM issues
<drfsupercenter> 03I use Firefox + Ad Muncher, no issues whatsoever
*drfsupercenter hides
<junh1024-XD> i use chrome and don't have MBAM issues
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not JUST MBAM
<drfsupercenter> 03it's MBAM + an ad blocker
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm telling you
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Light_Latias10) 11WB10»11•. 10- Sparky is now known as Sparky|Touhou <Angel_Espeon> Eating lunch and playing Touhou at the same time?, That's so pro <LL-Skyward_Sword> lol, nono, she eats Touhou and plays lunch
<Maidass> I have to be honest, my apartment is filthy. :-(
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Light_Latias03)02WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~
<drfsupercenter> 03when two things both try to block content
<drfsupercenter> 03it causes the world to explode
<Skylands> 10I love how violent he gets
<Maidass> I can no longer live the lie.
<drfsupercenter> 03and speak of the devil
<Maidass> I'm not a maid.
<Skylands> 10I told him that he'd defend Chrome like a fanboy
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Skylands> 10"F*cking B"
<Skylands> 10etc.
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't really care one way or the other, it's not like I go around telling people to use Firefox
<Skylands> 10"shut up and accept that I am right"
<drfsupercenter> 03I just like it myself :P
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<junh1024-XD> ORLY NAO
<Skylands> 10yarly
<drfsupercenter> 03hey, it Just Works®
<drfsupercenter> 03No browser is perfect but I don't run into those weird issues everybody else seems to have LOL
<junh1024-XD> debateable
<drfsupercenter> 03also LL
*junh1024-XD hides
<LunaTheBeloved> It was worth a shot
<drfsupercenter> 03I got Android to work on my tablet
<drfsupercenter> 03if you wanna try it on yours
<drfsupercenter> 03but it has this weird bug where, if you let the market update, it breaks wi-fi >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> Sky is a freaking moron
<HyperMetalLugia> She refuses to accept
<Light_Latias> 12wat
<HyperMetalLugia> that it is Mbam's fault
<Skylands> 10HML is a freaking moron
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<Krakass> Yeah, that revolution didn't last too long.
<HyperMetalLugia> I gave you proof
<drfsupercenter> 03OK seriously
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not *just* MBAM
<drfsupercenter> 03it's MBAM + an ad blocker
<drfsupercenter> 03How many times do I have to say this
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF
<drfsupercenter> 03if you disable the ad blocker
<HyperMetalLugia> I used IE
<drfsupercenter> 03it will work
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> it is still broken
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<HyperMetalLugia> so
<HyperMetalLugia> Mbam
<drfsupercenter> 03If the site itself is being blocked by MBAM
<drfsupercenter> 03then that's one thing
<Vinyer> !attack Xanbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's like what happens with LL
<Light_Latias> 12?
<drfsupercenter> 03where random cheezburger sites get blocked
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the two of them together
<Xanbreon> !Vinyer
<Light_Latias> 12oh
<Xanbreon> !Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Xanbreon for 10 minutes
<Vinyer> pff
<Xanbreon> !Umbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03you disable Ad Muncher, it magically works
<drfsupercenter> 03and so on
*Umbreon now belongs to Xanbreon for 9 minutes
<Light_Latias> 12...oh boy
<Vinyer> nice try
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon
<Xanbreon> eons got
<Vinyer> noo
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm having terrible luck
<Xanbreon> hai
<Light_Latias> 12I can smell the smoke again v.v
<Xanbreon> O-o?
<drfsupercenter> 03I have another hour or so left
<drfsupercenter> 03with the LARA console
<drfsupercenter> 03@ hetzner
<drfsupercenter> 03well for some reason
<drfsupercenter> 03"No hard drives detected"
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Xanbreon> Err
<drfsupercenter> 03it's an issue with the RAID controller
<Xanbreon> Support ticket!
<Light_Latias> 12there was a fire alarm about an hour and a half ago
<Light_Latias> 12i heard at work
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2010/10/installing-windows-server-2008-r2-server-with-3ware-9650se-raidcontroller/ <- I'm seeing this
<Vinyer> support Xanbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03but I don't know exactly which one it is
<Light_Latias> 12when I left work an hour ago
<drfsupercenter> 03it just says 3Ware
<Skylands> 10http://www.nightshadow.co.cc/BROWSER_WARS.jpg
<Light_Latias> 12I smelled smoke
<Light_Latias> 12now I can smell it at home
<Light_Latias> 12-.-
<drfsupercenter> 03I love how they make IE Look terrible
<drfsupercenter> 03in all honesty, IE 8 and 9 are pretty good
*Xanbreon cuts Vinyer's kneecaps off
*LunaTheBeloved is debating whether or not to have a fifth cup of coffee
<Skylands> 10butthurt
<Xanbreon> WHAT
<drfsupercenter> 03me? Not really
<drfsupercenter> 03as I don't actually use it
<Krakass> How is that a debate? Go for it. With 3 cubes of sugar.
<Vinyer> D:
<Xanbreon> IE8 was pretty crap
<Skylands> 10DRF no
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm getting off of IRC
<Skylands> 10HML is
<drfsupercenter> 03it just seems like people are saying IE sucks because it used to like 10 years ago
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Skylands> 10He ragequitted MSN
<HyperMetalLugia> if Skylands won't listen to me
<LunaTheBeloved> Okay :)
<HyperMetalLugia> Because
<HyperMetalLugia> I gave proof
<HyperMetalLugia> Both browsers
<junh1024-XD> i use Chrome & Opera on PC
<HyperMetalLugia> no adblocker
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon, I dunno, IE8 works well for me in XP and 7
<HyperMetalLugia> She refuses to listen
<HyperMetalLugia> So I've had enough
<Skylands> 10>getting mad over something silly
<HyperMetalLugia> Sky should just sleep
<Skylands> 10>my opinion doesn't matter anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes, because you're not listening and saying I am a liar
<Xanbreon> drfsupercenter, you are a derp
<drfsupercenter> 03I won't deny that :P
<Skylands> 10I listened
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04:I
<Skylands> 10I didn't call you a liar
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<junh1024-XD> HE LIKES TO DERP AND HE CANNOT LIE!
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03how do I figure out exactly which RAID controller is in my server?
<Light_Latias> 12wow
<drfsupercenter> 03I gotta figure out if it inherently doesn't work with Windows Server without external drivers
<Skylands> 10juhn, wat
<Xanbreon> Dunno
<Skylands> 10Anyways
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<drfsupercenter> 03?
<Skylands> 10I said just question the screenshot
<Skylands> 10Sheesh
<Light_Latias> 12I am getting the strangest feeling of deja vu, can't imagine why :P
<Vinyer> hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Skylands> 10-said
<HyperMetalLugia> Same difference, saying I am wrong when I *was* obviously right
<junh1024-XD> precisely!
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03what RDNS should I give my server
<junh1024-XD> @LL
<Skylands> 10No.
<HyperMetalLugia> Even before the image, you should have believed me
<drfsupercenter> 03preferrably not something dirty :P
<drfsupercenter> 03meh, I'll just put drfsupercenter.info in there for now cuz I'm uncreative
<Skylands> 10I'm not allowed to question someone?
<HyperMetalLugia> Not when you say that they'll do anything to 'defend' a browser
<HyperMetalLugia> When I also told you that IE was acting up
<Skylands> 10Shouldn't that be a compliment?
<HyperMetalLugia> But you said that you need proof
<Vinyer> so
<Vinyer> HyperMetalLugia, miss me?
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Vinyer
<Ascendant> drffffffffffffff
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and now everyone is going on about OCs
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant
<Skylands> 10juhnquit
<drfsupercenter> 03I am having
<Ascendant> yo
<drfsupercenter> 03terrible luck
<Skylands> 10lolol
<RX-78-SweetieBot> @_@
<Ascendant> issues?
<Vinyer> i'm on linux right now :D
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Tired of arguments so both of you just stfu, get along and drop the subject
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03something about the RAID controller :/
<Light_Latias> 12lol Angel
*Drake hugs Angel
<Ascendant> what's the problem?
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows won't find any hard drives
<Angel_Umbreon> 13or take it somewhere else cuz we don't wanna see that crap
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm not really sure what I can do
<Angel_Umbreon> 13>:/
<drfsupercenter> 03I've only got an hour left
<Xanbreon> b0rk
<drfsupercenter> 03and I paid 25
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03but maybe if I tell them what happened they'll give me more time for free
<Xanbreon> Well
<drfsupercenter> 03I slightly LOL'd, they took the Windows Server ISO I gave them and stuck it on a flash drive
<Krakass> Now I have to draw my OC
<drfsupercenter> 03a really slow flash drive at that
<Krakass> You know, we don't talk enough about OCs in here.
<Vinyer> hmm
<LunaTheBeloved_> I dc'd...what now?
<Xanbreon> Should have slipstreamed the drivers
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't realize it wasn't already there
<Xanbreon> :P
<Krakass> OCs
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >_>
<Xanbreon> Research!!
<drfsupercenter> 03I figured newer Windows should Just Work® with like 99% of RAID controllers
<drfsupercenter> 03I still can't fricking find which controller is even in it
<drfsupercenter> 03looking at my hetzner control panel
*RX-78-SweetieBot slaps Krakass around a bit with a large trout
<drfsupercenter> 03no idea
<Xanbreon> Should have emailed them about it
<Ascendant> o_O
*LunaTheBeloved nomz on the trout
<Vinyer> o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03it does have 4GB of RAM though, according to the BIOS, so memtest was derping
<Ascendant> lol memtest
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's got two 500GB Samsung hard drives, they were set to RAID1
<Xanbreon> :P
<Ascendant> what WERE you using for memtest anyway?
<drfsupercenter> 03I deleted the array and remade it just for good measure
<drfsupercenter> 03whatever was built in
<Krakass> I prefer salmon for future reference.
<drfsupercenter> 03to the recovery console
<Ascendant> that usually sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03but sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03why the frick
<Ascendant> see: HP
<drfsupercenter> 03they have an external RAID controller and no drives plugged into the onboard SATA ports
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sure the motherboard itself supports RAID >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03actually it does
<Ascendant> ,),
<LunaTheBeloved> Trout is good,salmon is better, but fresh flounder is best
<drfsupercenter> 03so why did they do that
<drfsupercenter> 03other than to piss me off
*drfsupercenter runs
<Xanbreon> Hardware raid ftw
<Ascendant> go yell at them
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently 3ware is a retarded barnd
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon are you saying BIOS RAID isn't hardware?
<Krakass> Why did the Northwest Coast Indians go fishing?
<Xanbreon> Of cause not
<drfsupercenter> 03I was under the assumption that it's built into the hardware
<Xanbreon> Its software O_o
<Xanbreon> on the cpu
<Xanbreon> No raid logic
<LunaTheBeloved> Do I wanna know?
<Krakass> Just for the Halibut!
<drfsupercenter> 03well I know my board has like 3 separate SATA controllers
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> that's kinda sad
<Ascendant> 3 separate ones?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes
<Krakass> That is my favorite cheesy joke.
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's got 12 ports overall
<Xanbreon> YOUR MOTHER IS SAD
<drfsupercenter> 036 of them are SATA2, that's all one controller
<drfsupercenter> 03then it has 6 SATA3, 2 and 4
<drfsupercenter> 03since apparently at the time, no SATA3 controllers could do 6 drives
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't really care, since I don't use RAID internally, only on my storage unit
<LunaTheBeloved> ....
<LunaTheBeloved> That was terrible and you should feel bad
<Krakass> :-(
<drfsupercenter> 03also Xanbreon, how do you slipstream Windows Server anyway?
<drfsupercenter> 03I only know how to slipstream 2000/XP
<drfsupercenter> 03not Vista/7
<Xanbreon> Same stuff
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Krakass
*Krakass is hugged
<Krakass> :-)
<Ascendant> this is why
<Ascendant> it's easier to VM windows
<LunaTheBeloved> I have some cheesy jokes as well
<Ascendant> on linux
<Krakass> Do share.
<Ascendant> rather than the other way 'round
<LunaTheBeloved> What did the fish say when he hit the wall?
<Krakass> What?
<LunaTheBeloved> Dam
<Krakass> Yup, that's the same category as my joke.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :D
<LunaTheBeloved> And with that I'm off
<Krakass> Well on that note, I'm going to go get my pizza and pick up something to drink for the Bronystate drinking game.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> bye LunaTheBeloved
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh
<BronyState> Which one is that/
<Krakass> Bye LunaTheBeloved
<Krakass> Well I used to drink when Deathstar would dance.
<LunaTheBeloved> Bye Krakass, Sweetie
<LunaTheBeloved> *SweetieBot
<Krakass> Now I just drink when someone complains about the stream.
<Krakass> Because I drank way too much.
<BronyState> Krakass, how does your liver take it?
<drfsupercenter> 03well once you get WIndows working, it just works :P
<Krakass> Not very well. I have to drink to shut it up.
<Ascendant> True dat
<Ascendant> so does linux
<drfsupercenter> 03I just think, overall Windows needs more resources so it's silly to virtualize that
<Ascendant> yeah, but you're also better off running what you're going to be running - apache, websites, etc. - on linux
<Ascendant> because running that stuff on windows fails
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm fine with IIS :P
<Ascendant> >IIS
<Ascendant> only thing it's good for is ASP
<drfsupercenter> 03it works fine for HTML for me

*drfsupercenter is just putting all the music back on his Zune, deleting the stuff he doesn't want etc
<drfsupercenter> 03but this song is cool
<drfsupercenter> 03no asking why I even own Radio Disney
<Hogia> 12O.o
<Kosoveon> I used to listen to radio disney like ten years ago
<drfsupercenter> 03I never had the radio station
<Kosoveon> I vaguely remember it now
<drfsupercenter> 03there isn't in Detroit area
<drfsupercenter> 03but my mom would buy me the CDs
<drfsupercenter> 03going "oh, this is DIsney, therefore it's not inapropriate" >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03Radio Disney now is just a bunch of teenage girl crap that nobody cares about
<Hogia> 12:c
<Hogia> 12I'm a teenage girl and I don't even care
<Hogia> 12so that rules that out
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the spirit.
<Hogia> 12:3
<Kosoveon> to each their own
<drfsupercenter> 03do you mean to tell us you actually LIKE Hannah Montana et al? :P
<Kosoveon> as I said, I don't listen to it anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03well you make it sound like saying Radio Disney sucks now is a bad thing
<Kosoveon> but some people do and that's OK, because that's their thing
<drfsupercenter> 03some people are also idilts :D
<drfsupercenter> 03*idiots
<Kosoveon> sure, *I* think it sucks now, but that opinion is not absolute
<Kosoveon> hence "to each their own"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but no need to cater to those who aren't actually here
<drfsupercenter> 03I can call most of humanity stupid because they aren't here to prove me wrong :P
*Hogia 12agrees
<Kosoveon> maybe, but I still try to be as fair as possible when I assess something, especially something popular.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the popular stuff that sucks, 9 times out of 10
*drfsupercenter likes being the underdog who likes unpopular things
<Hogia> 12:D
<Kosoveon> for some people, sure, but there tends to be reason why such thing is popular
<drfsupercenter> 03No, I'm not a fan of Skrillex, Hogia :P
<Hogia> 12everything is overrated these days
<drfsupercenter> 03*cough* iPods *cough*
<drfsupercenter> 03*cough* brainwashing *cough*
<drfsupercenter> 03Anyway
<Hogia> 12I know that, drf
<drfsupercenter> 03but yes
<drfsupercenter> 03basically everything IS overrated
<Drake> 04so
<Drake> 04drf
<drfsupercenter> 03people call me pessimistic, but really, it's true :P
<drfsupercenter> 03yes?

<LunaTheBeloved> I was the last one hired, first one to go
<RX-78-SweetieBot> UnFoundBug: because most people cant grasp basic strategy
<Lulu> 07,01what was the reason?
<LunaTheBeloved> The economy is just taking a toll on the restaurant, they had just hired some new employees, they were doing fine, then people stopped eating out as much, began losing money, had to let some people go, I was one of them sadly
<Lulu> 07,01yea.. the economy is bad atm.. well I hope you find a new job soon dear!
<LunaTheBeloved> So do I
<LunaTheBeloved> Thankfully I saved a lot of money before this happened

<UnFoundBug> has he been informed of otakons love?
<Yahooz> otakon ships with his bot. Not him
<UnFoundBug> true, but wouldnt he be concerned about his bots well being
<Yahooz> not really
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh, why is it that I can never stay awake during the day but I can be perfectly awake at night when I'm actually trying to sleep x.x

<HyperMetalLugia> Ubisoft and their spyware
<HyperMetalLugia> At least Windows picked it up
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what?
<drfsupercenter> 03the real question is, why are you using non-pirated Ubisoft :P
<HyperMetalLugia> well
<HyperMetalLugia> this is old ubisoft

<HyperMetalLugia> > Installed some registration program in System32/Windows folder
<HyperMetalLugia> I loled
<drfsupercenter> 03this is why
<drfsupercenter> 03you get Uninstall Tool
<drfsupercenter> 03it includes the "Install and Trace" feature
<drfsupercenter> 03so it'll tell you everything that was done during installation
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<HyperMetalLugia> haha
<drfsupercenter> 03what's fun though is trying to uninstall Uninstall Tool using Uninstall Tool
<drfsupercenter> 03sadly, it doesn't work as expected :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but for most programs, when you remove them, it runs the regular uninstaller and then scans your computer for leftover traces, it's surprising how many programs leave stuff behind

<UnFoundBug> man, i swear half the chat recently is either a) why there no stream or b) put something else on stream
<RX-78-SweetieBot> it should die down back to the regulars tomorrow
<RX-78-SweetieBot> weekend seems to retain alot of people from the friday night and saturday morning movies
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah
<UnFoundBug> yeah, hopefully, also with the easter holidays ending should cut down numbers significanylu
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Also my pick for B movie this week and all weeks until it gets shown is now G-Savior
<UnFoundBug> G-Saviour?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> G-Savior
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Alot of people are going to hate.
<UnFoundBug> gundam film...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Especially any weaboo gundam fans
<LunaTheBeloved> Never heard of it....
<RX-78-SweetieBot> But it must be watched
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Its a live-action gundam film. Sunrise commisioned a studio in canada to make it, but then gave them less than half the funding they said they were going to, and now sunrise does their best to disown it
<RX-78-SweetieBot> However, it wasnt terribly bad, and it does a good job of feeling gundam-ish while not playing through the same tropes and cliches nearly every series of gundam shoves in
<RX-78-SweetieBot> also the mobile suit designs or so very sexy
<RX-78-SweetieBot> are so*
<UnFoundBug> Ever watched Macross?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> yes
<RX-78-SweetieBot> its not really one of my favorite series, but its still good.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/X8tNk such a sexy robot design

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<DashWithRainbows> I know that feel.
<Aurora> ok ONE of those worked today
<junh1024-XD> oh, and who's this girl^?
<drfsupercenter> 03one of what worked?
<junh1024-XD> { touhou | pokemon }
<junh1024-XD> i dont have the pokemon script
<Aurora> 6Nitori is the kappa who lives on the mountain, the same one that Kanako's shrine is on. She's extremely timid but kind towards humans, and is rather clever with human devices, such as the ones that sometimes appear in gensokyo from the other world
<drfsupercenter> 03my server is almost fully back so we should be able to get ScriptBot back online soon
<junh1024-XD> wut kind of devices?
<junh1024-XD> liek cellphones?
<Aurora> 6yeah
<junh1024-XD> >MFW
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 chobits
<junh1024-XD> nonono
<Aurora> 6most people in gensokyo have no idea what stuff like that is, it's secluded from our world. Only 3 people know about the stuff from our world, yukari who can come here at will, rinnosuke who's ability allows him to know what an object does (just not how it works), and nitori, who can immediately figure out how they work
<junh1024-XD> magical girls figuring out things magically FTW!
*junh1024-XD hides
<junh1024-XD> rinnosuke is a guy, therefore he is a shopleeper.
<junh1024-XD> amirite?
<junh1024-XD> *keep
<Aurora> 6well, dunno about "therefore is a shopkeeper", guys arent forced to be shopkeepers
<Aurora> 6but he is one yeah
<junh1024-XD> i recall you said "the only dudes are shopkeepers"
<Umbreon> !espeon

<HyperMetalLugia> Morshu the shopkeeper!
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Aurora> 6I never said that no
<Aurora> 6the only dude character that's known is a shopkeeper
<Aurora> 6the other male character isn't really much of a character, he was an old swordsmaster
<Dagon> just checked my bank balance and nearly had a heart attack before I remembered my student loan was due
<Umbreon> HyperMetalLugia the linux lover
<junh1024-XD> what is Morshu.
<HyperMetalLugia> Morshu is a Zelda CDI character who sells bombs, rope and lampoil to Link

<Umbreon> although i did record one of the matches
<Drake> 04You're better than me, be happy.
<Umbreon> it was a pro with like 3 years of experience
<Umbreon> and i beat him because he stalled himself out XD
<Umbreon> if only you had black and white D:
<Umbreon> black or white
<Kimori> ummm

<Kimori> but its pretty much gone down to this again :P
<Umbreon> Drake i'm not better than you :P
<Umbreon> i forgot to factor in a counter for rain dance teams
<NightSeas> 12+G can be used when you don't want to kick someone who won't stop swearing
<Drake> 04Umbreon, trust me, I'm sure you're better than me.
<Umbreon> i lost to a guy who didn't even understand how to play
<Umbreon> he was just following his kid's orders before the tournament and mashing A
<NightSeas> 12I don't mind a little swearing, but +G can be useful
<Kimori> what does it do then?
<NightSeas> 1212it removes the swear word
<Drake> 04Not everything in Pokemon is about skill Umbreon
<Kimori> ah
<Drake> 04There's quite a bit of luck.
<Kimori> with what? this? @#$^ ?
<NightSeas> 12I'll show you how it works, but remember, it might fail :x
<Umbreon> well...
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.masswerk.at/googleBBS/
<Umbreon> the thing is that i didn't have much practice with my team
<NightSeas> 12[censored]
<NightSeas> 1212derp
<Umbreon> in fact i didn't get any practice with my team before the tournament
<Umbreon> you don't have a copy of black or white do you Drake?
<NightSeas> 1212there aren't any words loaded on the server for +G XD
<NightSeas> 12I'll have to add some
<Drake> 04I play White version, yes.
<Drake> 04But I don't train for competitive play at all. The only time I'll ever use competitive movesets/strategies is on PO
<Umbreon> well drfsupercenter

<Drake> 04ok, so that's cool, I'm connected on my DSi

<Umbreon> 81-97442-06424
<NightSeas> 12this place doesn't have a botserv

<Drake> 04Umbreon I have no idea what I'm doing here :'D
<Umbreon> go to the 2nd floor of the pokemon center

<Drake> 04ah
<Umbreon> i wanted that hitmontop dead so i wouldn't have anything to worry about
<Drake> 04You taught it Vacuum Wave?
<Umbreon> yes
<Umbreon> it's a special move set
<Drake> 04And then you paralyzed your Lucario XD
<Umbreon> yep
<Drake> 04Frankly you're lucky time ran out
<Umbreon> yes
<Umbreon> like i said
<Drake> 04You would've been at a serious disadvantage had it continued
<Umbreon> he stalled himself out of the match
<Umbreon> i didn't know discharge strikes everyone
<Umbreon> or it can paralyze
<Drake> 04Discharge has always been able to paralyze.
<Drake> 04And I hate how in 4th gen they changed several moves to strike your other POkemon as well.
<Drake> 04Surf used to be awesome :<
<Umbreon> to be honest
<Umbreon> i didn't really want to do good good
<Umbreon> because they were doing random black boxes of people's games
<Drake> 04Meaning?
<Umbreon> basically
<Umbreon> it's a device they use to check if the pokemon or game is hacked
<Drake> 04ARE YOURS HACKED?
<Umbreon> maybe.
<Drake> 04You don't know?

<Umbreon> i couldn't throw that team together in 2 days

<drfsupercenter> 03nope

<Umbreon> hi NightSeas
<NightSeas> 1212hai
<Umbreon> :)
<Umbreon> save me from xan
<Xanbreon> !umbreon
*Umbreon now belongs to Xanbreon for 20 minutes
<Umbreon> ;-;
<Xanbreon> Nop
*NightSeas puts leash and collar on Umbreon
*Umbreon yelps
<NightSeas> 1212:D
<Umbreon> that's not saving me
<NightSeas> 1212but why would I do that? :D
<Umbreon> it'd be a nice thing to do :D
<NightSeas> 1212but that wouldn't be fun :<
<Umbreon> :<
<Umbreon> sometimes the right thing isn't fun
<HyperMetalLugia> Umbreon
<HyperMetalLugia> I watched it
<HyperMetalLugia> :DDDD
<HyperMetalLugia> 135
<Umbreon> ahh :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Nova is Pogoguy? :P
<Umbreon> yes XD
<drfsupercenter> 03what sort of long series are you guys watching LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Some crazy serieds
<Umbreon> you don't want to know
<Umbreon> NightSeas
<Umbreon> i played in the VGC
<Umbreon> went 2-2 drop :<
<Umbreon> out of 7 rounds
<Umbreon> and 300 something players
<NightSeas> 1212ah :<
<Umbreon> my friend said it was 300 something
<Umbreon> i could have sworn it was 100 something though
<NightSeas> 1212wow
*drfsupercenter sighs
<Umbreon> Drake said i made a lot of misplays :P
<Umbreon> but says i'm better than him
<Drake> 04Only because you're willing to train and actually play competitively
<Umbreon> who said i trained them
<Umbreon> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL playing competitively
<Drake> 04The extent of my participation in the metagame is PO battles with NS and NightSeas
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it takes all the fun out of the games if you do that
<Umbreon> you won't say that when you taste victory
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> anyone for L4D2 ?
<drfsupercenter> 03*if* I do
<Umbreon> and win a regional which includes a trophy and a free trip to nationals
<drfsupercenter> 03there can only be one winner XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and given that I have almost less than zero self esteem
<drfsupercenter> 03what are the odds of that happening
<Umbreon> i didn't have time to legit train the pokemon
<Umbreon> plus i needed to catch cresselia
<drfsupercenter> 03my "training" consists of just playing the game
<Umbreon> which isn't easy
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't really get the point of EV training and all that
<Umbreon> i need to buy pearl
<drfsupercenter> 03I have one I never use
<Umbreon> hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not giving it away but you could borrow it or something :P
<Umbreon> i wish i could save state diamond or pearl right now
<drfsupercenter> 03you can if you have a flashcard
<Umbreon> that way i could catch cresselia
<Umbreon> tune it to a team's needs XD
<Umbreon> then save state back to before i caught cresselia so i can get another one in the future
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the roaming Pokémon (e.g. Cresselia) are actually pre-set when you start the game
<drfsupercenter> 03so their nature/EVs/IVs will always be the same
<drfsupercenter> 03regardless how many times you catch it
<Umbreon> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03yeay
<drfsupercenter> 03*h
<drfsupercenter> 03you would literally have to start a new game to get a different one
<Umbreon> i wonder if i could enter a cheat then
<Umbreon> to make every wild pokemon appear as a level 50 cresselia
<Umbreon> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but then it would be hacked?
<Umbreon> not really
<drfsupercenter> 03yes it would be
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought you were entering a tournament :P
<UnFoundBug> RX-78-3-SweetieBot my guns bigger than yours :P
<Umbreon> how do i know that wasn't the actual real cresselia i just caught? :P
<drfsupercenter> 03PIDs.
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> My big gun is currently in pieces
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> needs a good cleaning
<drfsupercenter> 03seriously, if yu do anything with the Pokémon in an editor besides just cloning it, it'll show as hacked
<drfsupercenter> 03it's pretty crazy :P
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> and that pistol was still in .44, so its not small
<drfsupercenter> 03*you
<Umbreon> well
<UnFoundBug> yeah, mines also not real :(
<Umbreon> if it spawns as cresselia
<Umbreon> wouldn't that just make it legit?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, but if you screw with the PIDs...
<Umbreon> well
<drfsupercenter> 03and if you use a generator, to make random PIDs, it would be obvious
<drfsupercenter> 03since like I said
<drfsupercenter> 03when you start your game
<drfsupercenter> 03the PID for the legendaries is already set
<Umbreon> this isn't really doing anything with the poke file
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's questionable
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> airsoft?
<drfsupercenter> 03I can ask bluesun
<UnFoundBug> yeah
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> ah
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Still fun
<Umbreon> just changing the routes to make anything that spawns a cresselia instead
<drfsupercenter> 03he actually has the official hack-checker
<drfsupercenter> 03don't ask how XD
<UnFoundBug> oh yeah, i can shoot that at other people
<Umbreon> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03bluesun is a genius
<UnFoundBug> well, sometimes
<drfsupercenter> 03he basically hacked the Dream World apart, figured out how to automate it all without using a browser
<UnFoundBug> its rather hot atm, so most sites wont let me ue it
<UnFoundBug> use*
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I have heavily modified nerf guns for shooting other people
<Umbreon> oh
<UnFoundBug> "heavily modified"
<UnFoundBug> read as?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> and one of them I cant use from closer than about 10m or it can peirce skin...
<UnFoundBug> ouch
<UnFoundBug> those things are foam ffs
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> yeah
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Nerf keeps making new ones harder to modify well though
<UnFoundBug> proabbly on purpose you know
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> nearly every new one uses the shitty reverse plunger inside a restriced case, so you mostly have to use the spring it comes with
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> oh, I know they are doing it on purpose
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, I think I have all the needed files
<Umbreon> o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm putting Android ICS on my HP TouchPad
<drfsupercenter> 03last time I tried, it broke
<Umbreon> ahh
<drfsupercenter> 03since I used the wrong files
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> and not just for safety, the engineers that work on it have come to a forum and talked about how they enjoy seeing how people modify the designs they make
<drfsupercenter> 03I was able to get Gingerbread, though
<drfsupercenter> 03so now I *think* I have the correct ones
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> they do it just to watch us XD
<UnFoundBug> well thats one way of interacting with a community
<UnFoundBug> keeps you interested
<drfsupercenter> 03not that WebOS is all that bad, there's just not very many apps for it due to it being "dead"
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> surprised they havent thought of making MLP: FIM nerf guns considering its all hasbro for both products

<UnFoundBug> MLP nerf guns?
<UnFoundBug> that inject brony shots
<UnFoundBug> all haters will join the herd!
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I say within a year or so hasbro will start making the crossovers between the various new incarnations of their franchises
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> And it will be glorious
<drfsupercenter> 03and now my tablet is in Linux mode XD
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, well, it's at least in the recovery, that's a good sign
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL @ ICS
<drfsupercenter> 03It has a "call Mother" option, even though A. it's a tablet and has no phone and B. I ahve no contact named Mother
<drfsupercenter> 03..and then it just rebooted itself when I took a screenshot?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/Q14lf
<Umbreon> latios backwards :D
<UnFoundBug> heh why dont people get the easiest way to avoid the shipping, is to ship
<drfsupercenter> 03OK seriously, why does Android think that Eastern time is GMT-4?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's GMT-5
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I dont get why they care, the shipping people on the chat is just silly fun anyway
<UnFoundBug> it can get a little out of hand, ie otakon
<Xanbreon> summertime
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> thats partly because he reacts so much to it. If he didnt, people wouldnt care
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean daylight savings?
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's still GMT-5, just with DST in effect (or not in effect, not sure)
<NightSeas> 1212drf :D

<Soital> 12backwards where
<Soital> 12NightSeas!
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL fail
<drfsupercenter> 03so ICS seems to work fairly well
<drfsupercenter> 03but they were lazy
<drfsupercenter> 03and just left stuff out
<NightSeas> 1212Soital!
*NightSeas pokes
<drfsupercenter> 03"Temporary placeholder until functionality merged"
<Xanbreon> Aka the rom is still under development
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but oddly enough
<drfsupercenter> 03the camera worked under GB but not in ICS
<drfsupercenter> 03it says "error: cannot connect to camera"
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd stick to GB but the wifi driver broke
<drfsupercenter> 03and cyanogenmod was like "eh, yeah, we know, just get ICS"
<Xanbreon> Kernel > userland APIs etc
<drfsupercenter> 03I kinda don't like trebuched
<drfsupercenter> 03*t
<drfsupercenter> 03can I use ADWLauncher on ICS?
<Xanbreon> cause
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I know ICS was compatibility hell and required everything to rewrite itself
<Umbreon> nom
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why updates of most of my apps were like "now works with ICS"
<Xanbreon> Lot of that was redoing UI stuff
<Xanbreon> Depends on the app
<Xanbreon> What it needs todo etc
<UnFoundBug> it is gettign VERY difficult to avoid spoilers on this new ep
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's not like XP to Win7?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Clearly you need to sever ties to the internet until the day it airs
<UnFoundBug> well i am just about finished downloading saints row
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> first one?
<UnFoundBug> might just make a chick, turn the "sex appeal" charachter stat to max and make her jump up and down for a bit
<UnFoundBug> the third
<drfsupercenter> 03ooh, it has a mode to optimize for a stylus
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> ah
<drfsupercenter> 03that would make Draw Something a lot easier
*drfsupercenter hides
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> its fun
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Burt Reynolds even shows up
<Xanbreon> Depends
<UnFoundBug> euch 2 hours still to download
<UnFoundBug> and 1 am
<UnFoundBug> im in uni at 9
*Soital pokes late
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon you use CM9 ICS?
<Xanbreon> Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03did they get rid of the CyanogenMod settings where you can tweak stuff?
<Xanbreon> No, theres device specific settings
<Xanbreon> And other stuff
<Xanbreon> Not all the settings are implemented yet
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to mess with the on screen buttons
<drfsupercenter> 03since, they put a home button on screen despite the tablet having a real home button
<drfsupercenter> 03and tehre's no menu button except in certain apps L>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03-L
<Xanbreon> No global menu button
<drfsupercenter> 03in CM7, under tablet tweaks, there was a way to
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf?
<drfsupercenter> 03in ICS at all?
<Xanbreon> ICS doesnt have one
<drfsupercenter> 03That's retarded
<Xanbreon> Its changed
<drfsupercenter> 03then what about phones like mine with a hardware menu button?
<drfsupercenter> 03I coulda sworn it works o.o
<Xanbreon> Of cause it works
<Xanbreon> But you dont need an onscreen menu button
<Xanbreon> As the UI has changed
<drfsupercenter> 03but if ICS doesn't have a menu button
<drfsupercenter> 03then what's that button doing :P
<Xanbreon> opens the menu
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03so why can't I put an onscreen menu button that does what my phone's menu button would?
<Xanbreon> Urk
<drfsupercenter> 03also stupid trebuchet
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate this thing already
<drfsupercenter> 03rebooting then installing ADW
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked CM7 better but >Bugs
<Xanbreon> trebuchet is great :D
<drfsupercenter> 03IO hate it
<drfsupercenter> 03-o
<drfsupercenter> 03laggy as f*** when switching homescreens
<drfsupercenter> 03also the auto-brightness sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<drfsupercenter> 03that's prolly a hardware issue
<drfsupercenter> 03though it did work in CM7
<Xanbreon> Meh
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03it's having the same f'ing issue as before
<drfsupercenter> 03where if I turn bluetooth on
<drfsupercenter> 03it breaks wifi
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<HyperMetalLugia> haha
<HyperMetalLugia> aww :<
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe that's not a CM7/9 problem then
<drfsupercenter> 03or rather
<HyperMetalLugia> did it happen in webos?
<HyperMetalLugia> As
<drfsupercenter> 03a problem with the hardware and how Android reacts to it
<Xanbreon> Gotta love driver issues
<drfsupercenter> 03of course not
<HyperMetalLugia> > Same antenna wifi
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03it works fine in WebOS
<drfsupercenter> 03I even have the official HP keyboard
<HyperMetalLugia> depends on the chip though
<drfsupercenter> 03bluetooth one
<Xanbreon> Blame HP for not giving src
<drfsupercenter> 03actually
<drfsupercenter> 03you know wha tI think it is?
<drfsupercenter> 03the f'ing market.
<drfsupercenter> 03in both GB and ICS
<drfsupercenter> 03as soon as I click Market and it updates to Google Play
<drfsupercenter> 03Wifi no longer works.
<drfsupercenter> 03Not sure WHY
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<Xanbreon> Shouldnt be related
<drfsupercenter> 03it's also HP
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah see
<drfsupercenter> 03"no network connection"
<drfsupercenter> 03let me try something
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll restore the initial backup before I setup ICS and try NOT turning the bluetooth on
<drfsupercenter> 03so are you sure the market doesn't replace any kernel-related stuff when replacing itself with Google PLay app?
<Xanbreon> Of cause
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drfsupercenter> 03ah hm
<drfsupercenter> 03I got IIS to work at least </not related>
<drfsupercenter> 03also ICS, IIS, stupid acronyms that are similar
<Ascendant> drf
<Ascendant> heeeeeeelp
<Ascendant> my wireless router isn't turning on ;_;
<drfsupercenter> 03yes?
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03did you try a hard dreset?
<Ascendant> no lol
<drfsupercenter> 03try that
<Ascendant> no power going to it
<Ascendant> for some reason
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe the power adater is broken
<drfsupercenter> 03*adapter
<Ascendant> I think it shorted out sometime during the night
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, nothign I can do from here about hardware problems :P
<Ascendant> yeah well it's been sitting there for whoknowshowlong
<Ascendant> and my modem wasn't working either
<Ascendant> I had to restart it
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, weird
<drfsupercenter> 03so if I turn the wi-fi off once it borks (e.g. updating the market) then back on, forget the router and then reconnect, it seems to work
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O

<Umbreon> hmm drfsupercenter
<Ascendant> yeah, that's my question too
<Umbreon> interesting
<Ascendant> I'm not actually sure
<Meanwhile> You're aware that my mouth (Or fingers) aren't on my legs right
<Ascendant> I thought about it before
<Umbreon> apparently in pokesav
<Umbreon> you can unset the cresselia event
<nickstr> there is no such thing as a WRT54L
<Ascendant> and it's probably about time it died anyway
<Umbreon> so you can make the game think the cresselia event never happened
<nickstr> there is a WRT54GL though
<drfsupercenter> 03Umbreon yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but again
<Ascendant> Ah yeah, it's a WRT54GL
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll be the same PIDs
<nickstr> that is a cool one
<Umbreon> well what if you set it to checked
<Umbreon> to make it think that it's done
<nickstr> its highly open to alternate firmwares
<Umbreon> then uncheck it again
<Ascendant> it's easy to configure nickstr
<drfsupercenter> 03no idea
<nickstr> Tomato and DD-WRT work
<drfsupercenter> 03just talk to bluesun sometime XD
<Ascendant> but the stupid thing keeps shorting out when I get a massive amount of traffic

<Xanbreon> Ascendant, okies, you know the power lead, "wall wart" or w.e
<Xanbreon> Do you have a comparable one?
<drfsupercenter> 03#pokemon-originals at irc.hoshinet.org
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<Ascendant> don't think so
<Umbreon> lol
<Xanbreon> Oh, btw, Ascendant I found out what the CPU spikes where
<Ascendant> oh?
<LunaTheBeloved> Yesh.
<Xanbreon> 2.5gbps UDP DDoS
<Xanbreon> :P
<nickstr> 400 packets per second
*Meanwhile hand leaps after LunaTheBeloved.
<nickstr> how the heck are you pulling that off!?
<Skylands> 10Ping
*LunaTheBeloved uses her LEGS and dodges
*Meanwhile lands on his face.
<Umbreon> no big deal
<Meanwhile> ;n;
<Umbreon> i can plow through diamond quite fate
<Umbreon> fast
<Umbreon> all i need to do is hack up some level 100s and hope they obey me XD
*LunaTheBeloved picks up Meanwhile and dusts him off
<drfsupercenter> 03yes but they check the *Entire save* for hacks
<drfsupercenter> 03not just your entries
<Umbreon> drfsupercenter
<drfsupercenter> 03so unless you're planning to trade them elsewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03don't do that
<Umbreon> that's why i always trade pokemon to my other versions afterwards
<Umbreon> XD
<Meanwhile> Most considerate.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<LunaTheBeloved> :)
*Meanwhile steals LunaTheBeloved's leg.
<nickstr> I guess for 400 packets per second you need to use a commercial router
*LunaTheBeloved falls over
<nickstr> that has a powerful enough CPU to handle the traffic

*LunaTheBeloved hobbles after Neanwhile
<LunaTheBeloved> *Meanwhile
<Umbreon> drf what i used to do was hack parents
<Umbreon> then EV train the pokemon inside those games
<Umbreon> then trade them to a game that was never touched by hacks
*Meanwhile surfs away on LTB's leg.
<Ascendant> 0:52:54] <Xanbreon> Oh, btw, Ascendant I found out what the CPU spikes where
<Ascendant> [10:52:57] <%Ascendant> oh?
<Ascendant> [10:53:04] <Xanbreon> 2.5gbps UDP DDoS
<Ascendant> [10:53:08] <Xanbreon> :P
<Ascendant> [10:53:12] <nickstr> 400 packets per second
<Ascendant> [10:53:18] <nickstr> how the heck are you pulling that off!?
<Ascendant> o_O Xanbreon
<Umbreon> you probably think that's a whole ton of effort for nothing, but that nintendo tournament was actually quite fun
<Xanbreon> Who have you pissed off this time NS?
<Umbreon> but getting caught with hacked pokemon would put an end to it right off the bat
<Ascendant> and nickstr, I ran some muhstik stuff which loaded immediately
<nickstr> yea, you need to spend something like $1,000 on a router alone
*LunaTheBeloved attaches Meanwhile's legs to her stumps and runs after you
<Ascendant> my router shorted out before it could be completed
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> restarted
<nickstr> an interprise level router
<Ascendant> true
<Ascendant> enterprise
<nickstr> like what you would see in large companies
<Xanbreon> So have you tried a diff power plug you derp
<SlurryMoon> 3mmm, I'll leave the RP alone for now...
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> I've plugged it into a diff port Xanbreon
<nickstr> the router is not "shorting out"
<nickstr> you are overloading the crap out of its CPU
<Xanbreon> What
<Ascendant> probably
*LunaTheBeloved nuzzles SlurryMoon
<LunaTheBeloved> Okay
*Meanwhile attaches LunaTheBeloved's leg and makes a hop for it.
*LunaTheBeloved tackles Meanwhile
*SlurryMoon nuzzles LunaTheBeloved back
*Meanwhile bites the dust.
<Xanbreon> I mean the <censored> power cable and the plug
<Xanbreon> Do you have an alt plug
<nickstr> nope
*LunaTheBeloved takes her legs back and gives Meanwhile his back
<LunaTheBeloved> Truce
<nickstr> did you read the part about 400 packets per second causing it to screw up?
<Meanwhile> Deal.
*Meanwhile reattaches his legs.
*LunaTheBeloved reattached her legs
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Meanwhile
<Ascendant> well
<Xanbreon> What the hell are you on about?
*Meanwhile hugs LunaTheBeloved.
<Ascendant> nickstr, that was ages ago
<Ascendant> haven't done it for a while
<Xanbreon> Im talking about something else
<Ascendant> and certainly not recently
<nickstr> oh
<nickstr> what kind of router were you pushing that level of traffic through
<LunaTheBeloved> How long have we been stealing each other's legs?
<Ascendant> well
<Meanwhile> Urrr...Pfft.
<Meanwhile> I can't remember.
<Ascendant> I kinda killed both connections
<Umbreon> i'm going to get sick XD
<Ascendant> mine and the server I was running it on
<Ascendant> but said server is a home server
<Ascendant> with a netgear router
<Umbreon> so many fun memories inside my diamond version and i'm going to erase it
<Ascendant> normally that derped first
<Meanwhile> A long time.
<nickstr> yikes
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah...
<Ascendant> Xanbreon, btw, do you know what IP got hit?
<LunaTheBeloved> Since last year at least
<Xanbreon> Ascendant, Good question, I will find that out
<nickstr> the clock speed on those is not too high plus not much RAM
<Meanwhile> I wonder how it started. (I really should know)
<SheenaFox> I no longer hunger
<Xanbreon> Ascendant, get a new router or try a new power supply
<drfsupercenter> 03so you finished the hunger games?
*drfsupercenter runs
<LunaTheBeloved> I think you started it...
<SheenaFox> Yeah
<SheenaFox> They were tasty
<Meanwhile> I can believe that.
<Ascendant> yeah nickstr
<Ascendant> I'm going to probably buy a new router today
<Xanbreon> do eit
<nickstr> good idea
<LunaTheBeloved> Not sure...might have been during a really boring movie and you just decided to do something crazy....
<nickstr> but look at its specs
<LunaTheBeloved> I dunno...
<nickstr> CPU clock speed and RAM
<Meanwhile> Might have just been a spur of the moment thing.
<nickstr> sort of like you were buying a computer
<Meanwhile> I'm totally ok with the whole situation. ^^
<Ascendant> ah
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh
<Ascendant> lol I'm going to have fun setting it up
<Ascendant> cus' it's not like I've ever done it before
<LunaTheBeloved> Itll always be our thing, legs
<Xanbreon> You derp
<Ascendant> This is my second router anyway
<Ascendant> the last one... died
<Meanwhile> Dem legs.
<Ascendant> but 2-3 years is kinda long for a router to last
<Ascendant> so I suppose that's okay
<Xanbreon> Not to bad
<Ascendant> in other news, brb, gonna switch the ethernet cable over to my better laptop
<LunaTheBeloved> Heheh
<LunaTheBeloved> It'll be ours...before some kid copies what we do in another room...
<LunaTheBeloved> And the leg stealing craze begins
<Meanwhile> Well, given that we only do it in this room, and to get in here you need to have a certain level of...something, I can't see that happening too easily :3
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, I think there's more to routers than just the CPU... I used to have routers drop connection all the time, then I got this cheap Realtek crappy one but it had really powerful antennas
<drfsupercenter> 03and it works a ton better
<drfsupercenter> 03whereas the $200 Linksys didn't
<nickstr> the antennas are passive
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah... :)
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why, realy, but we have like 10 devices regularly connected to the router so it overloads a lot
<nickstr> not active
<Meanwhile> ^_^
<nickstr> they can't have power
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the one I got has the largest legal amount
<drfsupercenter> 031W I thinkl
<drfsupercenter> 03-l
<nickstr> yea
<drfsupercenter> 03compared to the 500mW and such thta other routers had
<drfsupercenter> 03in fact
<drfsupercenter> 03that $200 Linksys had *internal* antennas
<drfsupercenter> 03it was also the highest rated router on Newegg
<drfsupercenter> 03but nope, didn't last a day in my house
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<nickstr> but you need antennas that have a lower gain and thus a lower eirp
<Ascendant> yeah, no, linux is hating trying to connect
<nickstr> in order to stay within the part 15 specs for WIFI
<Ascendant> I'm not bothered enough to work
<Ascendant> make it work*
<Umbreon> omg
<Umbreon> this dumb rival
<Xanbreon> Ascendant, it was pointed at solstice.ho-ohrealm.net
<Umbreon> always has been the most annoying one of the bunch
<Xanbreon> so .96
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> wtf
<LunaTheBeloved_> Dc'd
<Ascendant> probably dalnet
<Xanbreon> Who have you pissed off now?
<Meanwhile> Like a boss.
<Ascendant> wouldn't be me
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> my IP changed again
<Ascendant> ):
<LunaTheBeloved_> I don't think they ever would set boundaries....just a thought
<Xanbreon> :P
<Meanwhile> Boundaries?
<LunaTheBeloved_> For how long you've been at BS to be in this room
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a good thing
<Ascendant> yo
<drfsupercenter> 03>easier ban evasio
<drfsupercenter> 03n
<Meanwhile> Not officially.
<Ascendant> no it's not ):
<Ascendant> I have to reconfigure my IPv6
<drfsupercenter> 03I switched schools, then went to this one place I was banned from like trololol
<Ascendant> which I can't be bothered to do
<drfsupercenter> 03they were too lazy to re-ban me
<NightSeas> 1212well, look at thr bright side
<NightSeas> 1212now you're un-banned from everywhere
<Meanwhile> But generally it's considered to be a few months or something.
<Xanbreon> You are a derp
<NightSeas> 1212:D
<LunaTheBeloved_> Cause it'll only grow larger as the weeks go by...
<Ascendant> implying I was banned from somewhere
<Ascendant> besides NightSeas
<Ascendant> and drf for that matter
<drfsupercenter> 03the way you act? I'm surprised you aren't banned almost everywhere :D
*drfsupercenter hides
<Ascendant> if I wanted to ban evade
<Ascendant> I wouldn't use my own IP ):
<LunaTheBeloved_> Heheh....a regulars room for the regular regulars...
<Meanwhile> True, but this chat room has never grown particularly large. Probably because nowadays it's only really advertised privately.
<LunaTheBeloved_> Yeah, pretty much
<Meanwhile> #bronystateregularregulars tbh
<LunaTheBeloved_> It'll be done one day...
<Ascendant> awww
<Ascendant> I liked my previous IP
<Xanbreon> baddie
<drfsupercenter> 03well Ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03my IP changes every time I get a new router
<drfsupercenter> 03because the ISP bases it on MAC address or something
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's not surprising
<drfsupercenter> 03>Says we're low on IPv4 addresses
<drfsupercenter> 03>ISPs have dozens to spare
<Ascendant> it's heh
<nickstr> IPv6 really is not on my mind at all
<Xanbreon> Yeh, but we dont want to end up NATing our NAT's
<Ascendant> lmao
<Xanbreon> Thus IPv6 asap pls
<Ascendant> IPv6 is kinda meh

<drfsupercenter> 03I should request some IPv6's for my dedi
<Xanbreon> ohrly?
<Ascendant> don't you already have IPv6 on your dedi?
<Ascendant> get a /64
<Ascendant> also
<Ascendant> have you checked your dedi?
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ascendant> virtualbox wants to disconnect the network temporarily
<Ascendant> so I kinda left it
<drfsupercenter> 03I closed that
<drfsupercenter> 03because
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<Ascendant> cus' I didn't want it to kill anything
<drfsupercenter> 03you sure VMWare wouldn't work better?
<Ascendant> VMWare is kinda crap
<Ascendant> but sure
<Ascendant> I'll be happy to use vmware
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ascendant> I still like virtualbox better
<Ascendant> I don't really mind
<drfsupercenter> 03>VMWare Tools
<Ascendant> anything works
<drfsupercenter> 03is honestly what makes it work
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<Ascendant> heh well
<drfsupercenter> 03that's if you need a GUI
<drfsupercenter> 03if you're only using terminal
<drfsupercenter> 03then yeah
<Ascendant> I don't need a GUI
<HyperMetalLugia> the only thing better in VMware is the tools :s
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly XD
<Ascendant> I'm going to uninstall that crap
<Ascendant> as soon as I get the login set up
<Ascendant> sudo apt-get purge gnome
<drfsupercenter> 03I just know when I'd install Linux distros in VMWare, they'd lag like f*** until I installed VMWare TOols
<drfsupercenter> 03hence when you were all
<drfsupercenter> 03"ew Linux in VM"
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLGnome
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like
<drfsupercenter> 03SOmeone didn't install the tools
<Ascendant> HML, don't diss gnome
<Ascendant> gnome is nice ):
<Ascendant> at least gnome 2 is
<drfsupercenter> 03Gnome2 is nice
<HyperMetalLugia> But I thought
<Ascendant> gnome 3
<drfsupercenter> 033 is stupid
<HyperMetalLugia> you said gnome
*Ascendant cringes
<HyperMetalLugia> 3
<Xanbreon> Why even install the GUI to start with?
<HyperMetalLugia> I ewewww
<Ascendant> nah
<Ascendant> lmao Xanbreon
<Xanbreon> O-o
<Ascendant> cus' liveboot does it
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean that gnome in your pants?
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> hah
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a reference to a movie
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<HyperMetalLugia> Because GUI is fun ;<
<Xanbreon> What distro?
<Xanbreon> Aka use a better one
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm curious if I could somehow like, make the VM autostart when WIndows starts and so I don't have to worry about if I reboot, killing the thing for good LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what I should have done?
<drfsupercenter> 03is install ESXi
<drfsupercenter> 03then just put both OSes
<drfsupercenter> 03as a VM
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I just have no experience installing ESXi on metal
<Ascendant> and then I wouldn't have to rage at you
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, if you think it's worth paying another 20
<Ascendant> every time you restart the server
<Ascendant> metal?
<Ascendant> ESXi on metal?
<Ascendant> what?
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, hardware
<Ascendant> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03as in
<drfsupercenter> 03"I'm running Windows Server on metal" opposed to in a VM
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder how easy it is to set up an ESXi server though
<drfsupercenter> 03we used one at work
<drfsupercenter> 03because I wouldn't oppose to just wiping out my current setup and doing that
<Xanbreon> Just dont reboot it then
<Jaketehsnake> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I'll play
<Xanbreon> derp
<drfsupercenter> 03then I could give you like a gig of RAM or something maybe
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you need that much just for a terminal interface though?
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon, it's Windows, I reboot a lot :P
<Zoidberg> pornography
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drfsupercenter> 03porn on a terminal?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jaketehsnake just let me restart my laptop then ~
<Xanbreon> What the hell do you reboot for?
<Jaketehsnake> Sounds good
<drfsupercenter> 03if I accidentally break things :D
*Zoidberg uses google voice
<Xanbreon> good jorb
<Zoidberg> I DEMAND PORN
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03and well, eh
<HyperMetalLugia> Google voice?
<Ascendant> well drf
<drfsupercenter> 03I suppose once everything is set up
<Ascendant> I need at least 512mb :{D
<Ascendant> preferably 1GB, but tis' up to you
<drfsupercenter> 03then I won't need to reboot very often
<Zoidberg> where you search
<Ascendant> "very often"
<Zoidberg> with your voice
<drfsupercenter> 03but, when you mess with the server roles
<Ascendant> being once a month
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, IIS
<drfsupercenter> 03it makes you reboot :P
<Ascendant> ignore it ):
<Xanbreon> Lawl
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant, yeah, my server will have its monthly cycles too don't you know
*drfsupercenter hides

*drfsupercenter runs
<Xanbreon> BAddies
<drfsupercenter> 03well eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I would honestly prefer ESXi if you're serious about running Linux full-time
<drfsupercenter> 03that way the only way it would screw something up is if I did a hard reboot
<drfsupercenter> 03which... is kinda stupid anyway
<Ascendant> hahahaha drf
<drfsupercenter> 03as ESXi takes like 10 minutes to starty

*NightSeas hides
<HyperMetalLugia> XP, 7, LinMint (12) and Mac OSX 10.6

<drfsupercenter> 03n Known 64-bit processors:
<drfsupercenter> 03n All AMD Opterons support 64 bit.
<drfsupercenter> 03n All Intel Xeon 3000/3200, 3100/3300, 5100/5300, 5200/5400, 7100/7300, and 7200/7400 support 64 bit.
<drfsupercenter> 03n All Intel Nehalem (no Xeon brand number assigned yet) support 64 bit.
<drfsupercenter> 03that doesn't list any other AMD o.o
<Xanbreon> Generally any 64bit cpu with hardware VT should do
<drfsupercenter> 03though eh
<drfsupercenter> 03it says 2GB minimum of RAM... I hope the f'ing software itself doesn't eat that much
<Xanbreon> Nope
<drfsupercenter> 03so it should be fine?
<drfsupercenter> 03my only concern is that stupid RAID controller
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a 3Ware one, which isn't listed at all

<NightSeas> 1212it would be cool to have your own top-level domain

<Ascendant> so drf
<Ascendant> it'd be nice if you didn't restart anything
<HyperMetalLugia> So Ascendant, should I run Aircrack on my school's Wifi network?
<HyperMetalLugia> They use WEP :D
<Ascendant> lmao HML
<Ascendant> do it
<Ascendant> just be careful not to get caught
<Ascendant> if they do packet monitoring
<HyperMetalLugia> I doubt it
<HyperMetalLugia> Because
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll be using a USB stic
<HyperMetalLugia> stick
<HyperMetalLugia> and a VM
<HyperMetalLugia> That might protect me somewhat
<Ascendant> lol still
<Ascendant> wouldn't the local IP be the same?
<Ascendant> er
<Ascendant> nevermind
<Ascendant> I'm being an idiot
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder what I can do to the network using Aircrack :s
<Ascendant> hack into their router
<Ascendant> change passwords
<Ascendant> install trojan
<Ascendant> ???
<Ascendant> PROFIT
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder if I can get the admin password :c
<Ascendant> bruteforce it using ophcrack or something
<HyperMetalLugia> That'll work on a network domain?
<Ascendant> well you need to set a bruteforcer on the username admin and whatever domain it is
<Ascendant> start running with 8-character passes or something
<Ascendant> because that's probably their minimum
<HyperMetalLugia> i see
<Ascendant> unless your school is genuinely retarded
<HyperMetalLugia> Well yeah
<Ascendant> at the very least, it'd be 6, but I doubt it
<HyperMetalLugia> 8 char letter and number
<Ascendant> my school's network pass was some random 28-char or something
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<HyperMetalLugia> Wrell
<HyperMetalLugia> Wel
<HyperMetalLugia> *Well
<Ascendant> 8133!nsrradio@det#nsw$edu%au^
<HyperMetalLugia> I have the Wifi password
<Ascendant> that was the pass
<Ascendant> I'm like "lol you"
<HyperMetalLugia> Just not the silly windows admin pass
<Ascendant> hit f1
<Ascendant> ???
<Ascendant> PROFIT
<HyperMetalLugia> What does F1 do? :P
<Ascendant> in safemode
<Ascendant> admin thingy
<Ascendant> to reset admin pass
<Ascendant> probably disabled and everything
<Ascendant> but it's still slightly lulzy
<Ascendant> but hurr
<Ascendant> infect the router with a trojan!
<HyperMetalLugia> I swear one of my friend's user accounts is an admin
<Ascendant> there are some router trojans/viruses out there, but I've never really looked at them
<Ascendant> lmao
<HyperMetalLugia> and I was like, "How."
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 mass keylogging
<Ascendant> just keylog everything on the network :{D
<Ascendant> also altiris
<Chimera> Hi ascendant
<Chimera> :3
<Ascendant> ohai
<HyperMetalLugia> What does Backtrack linux do?
<Rukario> you don't want to know
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay :<
<Rukario> you don't care about linux anyway
<Ascendant> lol backtrack
<Ascendant> get konboot or something
<Ascendant> and hax the fuq out of the computers
<Ascendant> infect everything with winlogonn.exe or something
<Ascendant> or the naked wife virus even
<Ascendant> or that recycler usb virus
<Ascendant> that was such a lulzy virus
<Ascendant> my school had it for 1-2 years
<Ascendant> before the admins finally managed to block it
<Ascendant> it was, if nothing else, annoying
<Rukario> :<
<Ascendant> I think I'll go work on EpicStatsGuy
<Ascendant> Xanbreon
<Ascendant> I devised a system
<Xanbreon> What
<Xanbreon> Yes?
<Ascendant> to get around the incasesensitivity
<Ascendant> of $readini
<Ascendant> use $repcs to replace A with A' and stuff
<Ascendant> ;D
<Xanbreon> Oh yes?
<Xanbreon> Oooh
<Ascendant> because
<Ascendant> as you know
<Ascendant> readini is retarded
<Xanbreon> Yeh, <censored> stupid thing
<Ascendant> and windows is too
<Ascendant> >no case sensitivity
<Ascendant> WHAT U DOIN
<Xanbreon> But thats a cleaver work around
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> I've been considering it for quite some time
<Ascendant> but I didn't know about the $repcs
<Xanbreon> Whats that do?
<Ascendant> until a friend told me yesterday
<Ascendant> replace case sensitive
<Ascendant> like $replace
<Ascendant> except case sensitive
<Ascendant> I love how some commands have a case sensitive version
<Ascendant> yet readini doesn't
<Xanbreon> I cant even find any documentation on that cmd
<Xanbreon> the <censored>
<Ascendant> o_O
<HyperMetalLugia> Bawww, can't find my wifi usb stick
<Ascendant> er sorry
<Rukario> poor you
<Ascendant> I mean $replacecs Xanbreon
<Ascendant> and lol Xanbreon
<Xanbreon> You mean, using A' to mean A and A or a to mean a
<Xanbreon> Yes?
<Ascendant> yeah
<Xanbreon> Gotcha
<Ascendant> heh
<Xanbreon> As long as your input doesnt allow 's
<Xanbreon> :P
<Ascendant> you should see my workaround for the !pokemon script
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> you know how mIRC's $rand function can't do a specific range of numbers?
<Ascendant> like 1-2,4-5
<Ascendant> and skip 3?
<Xanbreon> Wouldnt be surprised
<SilverSonic> my ears are killing me atm.
<SilverSonic> ._.
<Ascendant> well it can't
<Ascendant> >: SilverSonic
<Xanbreon> Thats just <censored> retarded
<Ascendant> yeah well
<Ascendant> It is
<SilverSonic> thanks to that Nyan Cat 404
<Ascendant> heh
<SilverSonic> THAT BASS
<Ascendant> and the !setgen script
<SilverSonic> ON LAVANDER TOWN
<Ascendant> allows you to change gens, right, Xanbreon?
<Xanbreon> Oh yes
<Ascendant> so you can turn stuff like gen5/gen4, etc. off
<Ascendant> so I had to find a way
<Xanbreon> I have never really buggered about with that script
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> I dunno if I gave it to you
<Xanbreon> Probs something horrid todo with loops
<Ascendant> well
<Xanbreon> I had a poke around in scriptbot
<Ascendant> there's not that many loops
<Xanbreon> Loop while loop while loop while loops
<Ascendant> haha
<Ascendant> I'm fond of loops
<Ascendant> you can't blame me because mIRC sucks at doing things
<Ascendant> so loops are necessary
<Ascendant> and the pokemon script only has 1 loop
<Xanbreon> I blame you for everything ;)
<Ascendant> n16= var %gennumber 1
<Ascendant> n17= while (%gennumber <= 5) {
<Ascendant> n18= if ($readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen $+ %gennumber) == on) {
<Ascendant> n19= set %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] $+ %gennumber
<Ascendant> n20= inc %gennumber
<Ascendant> n21= }
<Ascendant> n22= else { inc %gennumber }
<Ascendant> n23= }
<Ascendant> I could actually just get rid of the else {
<Ascendant> and move the inc %gennumber to outside the if
<Ascendant> that's the only loop in the !pokemon script
<Xanbreon> Heh, general blerg at mIRC script
<Xanbreon> :/
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> but
<Ascendant> the actual printout line is a mess
<Ascendant> msg $chan $nick $+ , you are a  $+ $read(c0l0r5.txt,$rand(1,$lines(c0l0r5.txt))) $+ $read(pokemon $+ $mid(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ],$rand(1,$len(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ])),1) $+ .txt) $+ .
<Ascendant> lol colour codes got derped
<Ascendant> msg $chan $nick $+ , you are a  $+ $read(c0l0r5.txt,$rand(1,$lines(c0l0r5.txt))) $+ $read(pokemon $+ $mid(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ],$rand(1,$len(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ])),1) $+ .txt) $+ .
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> but yeah
<Ascendant> it's a large mess
<Ascendant> that's just the one line to print out the pokemon
<Xanbreon> Funfunfun
<Ascendant> and the !setgen script doesn't have any loops
<Ascendant> it's only if-elseif-else
<Ascendant> so overall it's a fairly loopless script
<Xanbreon> Just spending a lot of time working about mIRC's b0rkness
<NightSeas> 12Not really XD
<NightSeas> 12derp

<LL-L4D2> 12o.o
<Kyu> 07</sexism>
<Kyu> 07don't worry, I question my existence too
<Aurora> what existence
<Kyu> 07I wouldn't know, I'm not sure I have one
<Kosoveon> what existence is there but the desire for existence
<Kosoveon> </philisophical>
<Kyu> 07what philosophy is there but the philosophies of lazy nerds
<Kyu> 07:'D
<Hogia> 12I hate babies too
<Kosoveon> what is philosophy but lazy nerds trying to explain things that cannot be explained
<Kosoveon> :'D
<Kyu> 07yep.
<Kyu> 07Hogia is definitely a man
*Kyu runs
<Drake> 04What are lazy nerds except those whom are rejected by philosophy?
<Drake> 04!kyu
*Kyu 07does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.
<Hogia> 12I wish
<Kosoveon> What are nerds rejected by philosophy if they are rejected by everything else to begin with?
<Kosoveon> </foreveralone>
<Hogia> 12:'D
<Drake> 04If nerds are rejected by everything, are they rejected by themselves?
<Kyu> 07what are philosophers if not people who work at Burger King even after recieving a doctorate?
<Drake> 04/philosoraptor
<Hogia> 12no
<Hogia> 12O.o
<Hogia> 12that is truly a depressing life
<Drake> 04If rim is the opposite of middle, and sky the opposite of earth, is Skyrim the opposite of Middle Earth?
<Kosoveon> What are philosophers if they reject not only themselves, but their own concept of existence outside geting a degree at Burger King and questioning their own existence like the losers they are?
<Hogia> 12My head *shot*
<Kosoveon> What is Drake's love of Skyrim if Skyrim does not love him back?
<Hogia> 12nope, I can handle that
<Kosoveon> wait
<Hogia> 12Skyrim is too mainstream *hides*
<Kosoveon> "getting a degree at burger king"
<Drake> 04HIPSTEEEEEEEEEER
<Kyu> 07Ask not for whom the arrow shoots, it shoots knees.
<Kosoveon> BACHELORS IN BURGER FLIPPING PLEASE
*Kyu RUNS
<Drake> 043rd degree?

<Drake> 04burn?
*Drake runs
<Hogia> 12someone noticed c:
<Ascendant> FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE
<Hogia> 12EXPLOSIONS
<Drake> 04^
<Drake> 04That's my line!
<Drake> 04>|
<Hogia> 12I could do worse
<Hogia> 12like
<Hogia> 4explosions
*Hogia 12FLEES
<Kosoveon> an explosion within an explosion is but a man's struggle to survive
<Kosoveon> to feel relevant in an irrelevant world.
<Kosoveon> or maybe just because EXPLOSIOOOOOOOOOONS
<Kyu> 07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWofgnLXTtk
<Drake> 0412Can I be a hipster like you Hogia?
<Hogia> 12hey
<Drake> 0412It's ironic because a lot of people use blue text XD
<Ascendant> brb, gonna attempt to get my LAN cable working on linux
<Hogia> 12blue's my colour
<Kosoveon> that's just like, your opinion, man.
<Kyu> 07Drake can be female ironically
*Drake slaps Hogia
<Kosoveon> </indie>
*Drake is a girl now?
<Kosoveon> go figure o.o
<Hogia> 12O.o
<Kyu> 07well you're doing it ironically
<Kyu> 07so you're a "girl"
<Hogia> 12XD
<Kyu> 07the air quotes are important when being ironic
*Kyu nods
<Drake> 04DID YOU SEE THOSE TWO BEAT PANELS?
<Drake> 04THEY WERE CRUCIAL TO THE JOKE
<Hogia> 12...?
<Kosoveon> that's very "ironic" indeed
<Kosoveon> I'm "sure" that "Drake's" gender is "verifiable"
<Hogia> 12this video makes me happy
<Hogia> 12Now you're just overusing the quotation marks
<Hogia> 12leave them alone before you kill them
<Kosoveon> "Hogia," that's the "idea" of being "ironic" about "everything"
*Kosoveon kills himself with a quotation mark before he can be even more ironic.
<Hogia> 12you're going to make that punctuation mainstream
<Hogia> 12stop it
<LL-L4D2> 12o.o
<LL-L4D2> 12Hogia
<LL-L4D2> 12stuff

<Hogia> 5?
<Drake> 04But there's nothing I'm willing to trade
<Umbreon> that you don't need to go onto the dream world or the GTS to get dream world abilities legitly

<Drake> 04Nowai
<Hogia> 5whoa
<Hogia> 5how

<Hogia> 5fair enough
<Aurora> Vega stays right here with me lmao
<Umbreon> and a male that isn't a ditto to "bread" with it

<Aurora> 6cuz i didn't nickname her vega on the other game
<Aurora> 6so her name is still charizard

<Drake> 04We don't need sugar-high NS
<Ascendant> chocolate is bad
<SilverSonic> inb4 NS goes in the grass
*SilverSonic hides
<Ascendant> huh?
<Drake> 04"So you're NOT secretly plotting my downfall so you can have Marten all to yourself?"
<Drake> 04"Oh, I'm plotting your downfall alright. Just not 'cause of Marty."
<Drake> 04"Then why?"
<SilverSonic> check the video for the reference NS
<junh1024-XD> who is Marty/marten?
<Drake> 04"Just plain old ornery-ness, I think. Plotting downfalls makes me feel...tingly."
<Drake> 04"We have GOT to get you laid."
<Ascendant> SilverSonic
<Ascendant> I'm on my craptop
<Ascendant> which blocks sites
<SilverSonic> oh. i forgot

<Drake> 04@jun: A frustrated 20-something
<Drake> 04Didn't NS get an upgrade for that?
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<Ascendant> I have 120GB or 60GB on/off peak
<Ascendant> I think
<Ascendant> not sure what the 120GB entails exactly
<Drake> 0460GB is still better than me
<Ascendant> true dat
<junh1024-XD> OP probably means during 12-6AM
<junh1024-XD> check with your ISP
<junh1024-XD> i also have 60+?? per month
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04Finish Jedi Starfighter?
<junh1024-XD> but that gets used up p. quickly with my sister streaming videos
<Drake> 04Man, I wanna play Jedi Starfighter again
<Ascendant> Yes I did
<Ascendant> I've been replaying parts using the Sabaoth Fighter
<Drake> 04Is it fun to play as it?
<Ascendant> Yep
<Ascendant> its lasers are fantastic
<Ascendant> Also Jinkins' aircraft, the Freefall, is awesome
<Ascendant> I also love Nym's yellow missile beam things
<Ascendant> Which Jinkins also has
<Drake> 04Cluster Missiles?
<Ascendant> yep
<Ascendant> I love those, Drake
<Ascendant> They bypass shields
<Drake> 04Yeah XD
<Ascendant> The mines on the other hand
<Ascendant> were pretty useless
<Drake> 04I remember trying to take down the Saboath Destroyer with them on that tug level
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Ascendant> oh lmao
<Ascendant> I've noticed how most of the stuff on the left arrow thingy
<Drake> 04Take down the Destroyer. Crap, THERE'S ANOTHER
<Ascendant> are useless
<Ascendant> shockwave, mines, etc.
<Ascendant> lmao
<Drake> 04What, like Force Shockwave?
<Drake> 04That was terrible
<Drake> 04The last mission was awesome, right?
<Ascendant> it was alright
<Ascendant> I preferred the 14th mission/heart of the storm
<Ascendant> where you had the Ion Cannon and also had to defeat Bella
<Ascendant> I did that with a Sabaoth Fighter
<Ascendant> so fun
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04The one where Nym uses the Ion Cannon against the Destroyer with the Hex Missiles will always be my favourite
<Ascendant> Basically when I used Nym's craft the first time
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> Anyway
<Ascendant> I'm off to play some starfighter

<drfsupercenter> 03ugggggggggh I feel so sick
<drfsupercenter> 03I woke up at like 4am and threw up a few times :/
<Skydroid> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03missed my 8am class, too
<Skydroid> Eat something bad?
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently my alarm was playing for an entire 30 minuters
<drfsupercenter> 03-r
<drfsupercenter> 03and I didn't hear it
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03which is odd as it's pretty f'ing loud
<Skydroid> 0931 <Skydroid> Eat something bad?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not sure
<drfsupercenter> 03actually maybe
<drfsupercenter> 03does cream cheese go bad if it's at room temp for too long?
<Irres> Probably?
<drfsupercenter> 03then probably
<drfsupercenter> 03it's weird though
<drfsupercenter> 03at my work, they'd have cream cheese just sitting out
<Skydroid> Depends
<drfsupercenter> 03never refridgerated
<drfsupercenter> 03this kind I had in the fridge
<drfsupercenter> 03and the fridge was so cold it *froze* it
<drfsupercenter> 03so I let it thaw
<drfsupercenter> 03perhaps for too long
<Skydroid> it could go for an hour or two
<drfsupercenter> 03as it was all...weird when I went to eat it
<drfsupercenter> 03oh it wasn't more than an hour or two
<drfsupercenter> 03probably around an hour
*Skydroid shrugs
<Skydroid> It tasted odd?
<drfsupercenter> 03no, it tasted fine
<Irres> Please don't describe it in any detail 'cause I think I'll be sick if you do.
<drfsupercenter> 03but the texture of it was a bit weird
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it's just a classic case of "I ate too much"
<drfsupercenter> 03but for some reason my stomach is weird and I don't get a stomachache until like 12 hours later
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Irres> Join the club.
<Skydroid> Takes time to digest food
<Skydroid> That's why you do not feel the effect til later
<drfsupercenter> 03well you can usually feel *full* right away
<drfsupercenter> 03for me it just skips that stage entirely LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well, sometimes
<Irres> Like the morning after so it looks like I've had alcohol :'D
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that's what usually happens to me
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll wake up in the morning with a stomachache
<drfsupercenter> 03never at night
<drfsupercenter> 03only in this case I couldn't even make it through the night x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> ohey DRF
<Irres> Wake up sick as hell, but I can't vomit to make the pain stop
<drfsupercenter> 03My Radeon HD card sold
<drfsupercenter> 03to some dude in Brazil

<Irres> Worst. Feeling. Ever.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I know what you mean
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not like I *want* to throw up
<drfsupercenter> 03and usually I don't, it's only if it's bad enough
<drfsupercenter> 03that my body just goes "OK this is enough"
<drfsupercenter> 03http://sb016.100tbh.com/Proxy/ <- oh hey

<drfsupercenter> 03so I was like sure, why not
<drfsupercenter> 03it's cheap enough where I can just pay for 1 month and see if it works
<Xanbreon> Its leasesweb isnt it?
<Xanbreon> Meh
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate leaseweb to

<Drake> 044 Kids was good at dubbing the Pokemon Anime
<drfsupercenter> 03live action movies too
<drfsupercenter> 03just not a fan
<Drake> 04But now I'm used to Ash's other voice.
<NightSeas> 1212same
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't watch the new anime
<drfsupercenter> 03>BW
<drfsupercenter> 03someone hand me a 10 foot pole
<drfsupercenter> 03and then remind me not to touch it with that
<NightSeas> 1212I liked the change, although some of the Pokemon are stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03try all?
<Skylands> 10I was curious cuz I am strongly against the Puella Magi dub. It's coming from someone who has seen the original a bazillion times and gaah
<Skylands> 10They butchered all the voices
<NightSeas> 1212but hey, what gen doesn't have stupid Pokemon? :'D

<drfsupercenter> 03or rather, hearing'
<NightSeas> 1212with me it depends on the anime

<drfsupercenter> 03that's funny you say that
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually just bought the dub DVDs of that show
