<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> Bronyx135 was it ballad of the bronies?
<Bronyx135> yes
<Magical_pablez94> Bronyx135: obviously :D
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> I LOVE THAT
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> wat is this

<Ninjazz> That's the group, silly."D
<Ninjazz> :D
<Bronyx135> check equestria daily
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: joking
*AlienEd27 does nothing
<P0N-3> Hearth and Plow Day celebrates and commemorates when homesteaders came to Ponyville and made their homes their,a nd sowed their crops.
<P0N-3> And founded Ponyville.
<Bronyx135> wow
<Viri> 14veges
<Ninjazz> You're funny, Magical_pablez94. :P
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> DAFUQ...

<AlienEd27> 6_9
<Ninjazz> THE SMOOOOZE!
<Ghosties> 04<Memme> I am bored. Entertain me, fellow bronies. <-- But I don't wanna
<Twi_Fi> :O
<Bronyx135> dedicated brony for life :D
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> ...
<Memme> Ghosties: But I wanna!
<VDXRetrotainment> Memme: Only you can unbore yourself. :P
*Ninjazz runs for his life
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: ha.ha.ha. i'm so funny.
<Ghosties> 04Go juggle a melon or something
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> what is...dafuq am i...what the...
<P0N-3> This video is pretty terrible.
<Memme> Ghosties: Why not an apple? D:
<Magical_pablez94> tons of muk
<Ghosties> 04Because apples aren't for juggling :I
<Bronyx135> lol?
<Ninjazz> That is Lord Smooze, fillies and gentlecolts.
<Memme> Ghosties: And how do you know!?
<Ghosties> 04I am the color of red
<Ninjazz> Destroyer of all of Equestria.
<Ghosties> 04And apples are red
<xmasskills> Ghosties: can i juggle oranges then
<Bronyx135> but
<Ghosties> 04So I THINK I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT NOT JUGGLING APPLES, JUST SAYING
*Magical_pablez94 "muk i choose u!!!!!!"
<Bronyx135> the orange family...
<Ninjazz> Ghosties: And Applejack is orange. :P
<Phase4-> 00,02Ghosties, Logic!
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> YESY
<P0N-3> I'm always amazed that the early pony series got just a little bit right, but the new one gets so MUCH right.
<Memme> Ghosties: Well. Twilight is an egghead. I am an egghead. Therefore, I am Twilight Sparkle!
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> I LOVE THIS REMIX
<VDXRetrotainment> Which is this PMV...PHas?
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4*
<xmasskills> Magical_pablez94: what is muk spelled backwards
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> I GOT THIS REMIX ON MY IPOD YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Bronyx135> what remix
<Ghosties> 04Now you're thinking with logic, Memme :D
<Ninjazz> Flutterwonder.
<Phase4-> 00,02^
<xmasskills> what is this remix
<DrGNs> hey hey
<Memme> Ghosties: Wow. My life has been changed.
<Magical_pablez94> xmasskills: u pervert :D
<P0N-3> Why the hell am I listening to reggae right now.
<Ghosties> 04I know right
<Ghosties> 04By the way
<Memme> It's incredible.
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> SO MANY WONDERS FLUTTERWONDER BY pinkiepieswear or wooden toaster i believe
<Ghosties> 04That Flutterwonder video that seems to have become quite popular
<VDXRetrotainment> Added to favourites in a yip
<Ninjazz> Needs more A Beautiful Heart
<Memme> I can't see the stream...
<Memme> Now I can!
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> whats that thing sweetiebell made punch or something
<Ninjazz> That's a better SoGreatPowerful song imo.
<Bronyx135> i dont like it when people make lesbian pony porn
<Ninjazz> Random :S
<Memme> I don't like it when people make pony porn.
<Ghosties> 04Funfact: it's very much in the same vein as the style of another famous DJ on YouTube these days: Pogo (Fagottron) and I emailed him last year asking that he would make a FiM song/video
<xmasskills> Bronyx135: well there are only so many male ponies...
<Bronyx135> it disrespects our entire bronyism systm
<Memme> Did he accept it?
<Phase4-> 00,02had to do a thing that probably bugged out the stream
<Phase4-> 00,02sry bout that
<Ninjazz> WHoa Whoa WHoa...
<Bronyx135> well still
<P0N-3> I just requested the Fluttershy Fireflies parody.
<Ninjazz> Don't be getting on that.
<Ghosties> 04He never replied back
<Bronyx135> pony porn sucks
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> PONY PORN HURTS MY EYES MY BUTT AND FELLINGS
<P0N-3> I hope they're nice and put it on.
<Memme> Ghosties: Oh.
<Ghosties> 04Which, I figured he wouldn't
*Ninjazz sighs
<DrGNs> cake
<Ninjazz> So many kids in here.
<Ghosties> 04But still, it was worth a try
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> and it froze...
<Ghosties> 04Something wrong, Ninjazz?
<Magical_pablez94> each times she sais oooh i expect to hear "what a woderfull place :D"
<DrGNs> beyond her garden"
<Bronyx135> :[
<Memme> I don't like Fluttershy X.X
<P0N-3> This is good too!
<Ninjazz> Ghosties: Just people not taking the time to understand another person's situation.
<Bronyx135> ALL UR BASE R BELONG TO US :[
<Ghosties> 04Prepare for an onslaught of hate and intolerance, Memme
<P0N-3> My bass belongs to EVERYpony!
<Memme> Ghosties: Yep.
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> OPPATUNITA
<Memme> I am prepared!
<Ghosties> 04But then
<VDXRetrotainment> Ghosties: Impossible, we share love and tolerance!
<Ghosties> 04The brony fandom is very fickle
*P0N-3 grins and wheels out her bass cannon. :D
<Bronyx135> to all who think bronies suck
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> Y U SEE
<Bronyx135> I will love and tolerate the SHIT out of you
<Ghosties> 04So quick to ostracize and denounce anyone that doesn't like what the majority likes
<Ninjazz> That is... true...
<Memme> Ghosties: The bronies, or haters?
<VDXRetrotainment> P0N-3: You ddestroyed Discord with that...tkae it away XD
<Ghosties> 04The bronies
*P0N-3 pounds the big red button on the top, and... all the dishes get clean.
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> BRONIES FTW
<Ghosties> 04Haters are trolls, bronies can be outright blind
<fillyfillyy|AFK> Bye everypony I have to go
<Bronyx135> bronies or death
<Bronyx135> bye
<Memme> I love discussing bronies.
<Bronyx135> oh hey
<Bronyx135> that reminds me guys
<Ninjazz> Cya fillyfillyy|AFK.
<ImOkayWithThis|Derp> bai fillyfillyy|AFK
<VDXRetrotainment> Oh look guys
<Memme> I like discussing MLP with my non-brony firends.
<Memme> *friends.
<VDXRetrotainment> IT*S MEDIA TELLING THEY ARE AWESOME and only 5 see that SOMETHING is wrong! XD
<Bronyx135> why does everyone argue when someone says "somebody" instead of "somepony"?
<Memme> I don't.
<Ghosties> 04Somebody
<Bronyx135> we dont say "somehuman"
<P0N-3> Discussing MLP with non-brony friends sounds awkward. Do you like being awkward?
<Bronyx135> yes
<Ninjazz> I remember when being a brony just meant you like ponies and aren't part of the general target audience.
<Ghosties> 04Because I also don't use ponyisms either
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> or just simply say...something...
<Bronyx135> it makes good stuff to blog about
<Memme> P0N-3: Well, I trust my friends.
<Bronyx135> ;)
<VDXRetrotainment> GO GRANNY!
<Memme> P0N-3: I accept them, they accept me.
<ImOkayWithThis|Derp> I want that hat
<Memme> Kind of.
<Ninjazz> Ew. Bed mane Granny...
<P0N-3> Yeah generally speaking being a brony is just being outside the targeted gender and age demographics.
<Bronyx135> i dont understand, but i agree
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> poor dashie...
<Ninjazz> Then we got terms like Cloppers, and other stuff.
<P0N-3> ANYpony who likes the show and is not a little girl is technically a brony (or a pegasister if they're a guhrl).
<Ghosties> 04Though it's getting to the gender and age that FiM is targeted to
<Bronyx135> ugh
<Memme> A question: If I enjoy watching MLP, am I a brony?
<Phase4-> 00,02woah
<Bronyx135> cloppers
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> PARIEL
<Phase4-> 00,02did that break for anyone else?
<Bronyx135> supporters of pony porn
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> MA LITTLE PONA
<Magical_pablez94> :D:D
<Memme> It broke.
<Memme> Phase4: It broke.
<Ghosties> 04Depends, Memme
<DrGNs> If you associated more with the fanbase then I'd say Memme
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> :D:D:D:D :3
<[WwqUB]JRP2234> it dun goofed
<Ghosties> 04Everything okay, Phase?
<Tassadork> not btoke for me
<Bronyx135> I WILL LOVE AND TOLERATE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU!!! :[
<Tassadork> *broke
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> there's no AJ emotion
<Ghosties> 04Bronyx135, it's okay
<Ghosties> 04You're fine
<Memme> Ghosties: I saw a guy on Youtube who was like that. Enjoyed the show, but didn't want to be called a brony.
<P0N-3> I think my neighbour is having CMFIS. She's ranting about pencils and lists.
<Magical_pablez94> Phase4-: broke
<Bronyx135> sorry
<Bronyx135> got bored :/
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIEPIESWEAR PLEASE
<Ninjazz> Memme: Perfectly fine.
<Bronyx135> ;)
<P0N-3> I can hear him through the waaaalls.
<Phase4-> 00,02stream ended, it only streams if i've got stuff qued
<Ghosties> 04You don't have to love and tolerate to be a brony
<Bronyx135> whos your favorite pony guys
<Memme> Twilight.
*DrGNs just fine hint hint
<Bronyx135> ttt
<P0N-3> Him, he. It's a stallion. I don't know why I said she.
<Memme> Twilight FOREVER
<Magical_pablez94> Bronyx135: Luna
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> JUST FINE HINT HINT
<P0N-3> He crazy yo.
<Ghosties> 04In fact, I'd encourage you to use your reasoning and logic
<Bronyx135> Pinkie Pie
<DrGNs> One does not simply pick a favorite pony
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIEPIESWEAR PLEASE
<Phase4-> 00,02hmmm, the frame its stuck on sugests dubstep
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4: The video I recommended for you? =3
<Memme> Ghosties: What do you mean?
<P0N-3> Smile Smile Smile is one of my favourite songs so far.
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> for me it's stuck on the loading screen
<Memme> Ghosties: In what terms?
<Bronyx135> pinkiepie always makes me laugh
<Ghosties> 04Maybe you should try to cut the stream and then re-stream
<Ghosties> 04When I say "use your reasoning and logic?"
<Bronyx135> shes always the one whos doing the exact opposite of the situation at hand :)
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIEPIESWEAR PLEASE
<Ghosties> 04Is that what you're asking, Memme?
<Memme> Ghosties: Yea.
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> what is going on here...
<Ghosties> 04@AppleJackTheOneAndOn: Please stop trying to demand requests
<Bronyx135> total broniness
<Memme> I wish people used private chat more here.
<Bronyx135> thats what
<VDXRetrotainment> WUuuuub!
<Ninjazz> BASS CANNON!
<Phase4-> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, sry, forgot about that
<Memme> ME GUSTA MUCHO.
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> YAY
<Tassadork> bass cannnon!
<VDXRetrotainment> P0N-3: DAMNIT I told you TO NOT BRING THAT UP! AAAAAAaaaaaaaaaa....
<Magical_pablez94> P0N-3: BASS-CANNON!!!!
<pony_8744> Fuck yo WUB WUB
<P0N-3> Do they EVER take requests in #Vinyl_Scratch?
<Memme> The brony fanbase is incredible.
<Phase4-> 00,02brb
<Bronyx135> yeah
<VDXRetrotainment> P0N-3: Very seldon. =3
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> NEXT SUNSHINE AND CELERY STALKS BY PINKIE PIE SWEAR
<Bronyx135> except for the porn :(
<Memme> AppleJackTheOneAndOn: Wrong chat.
<Ghosties> 04And what I mean is that the brony fandom tends to blindly follow love and tolerance, it's stopped being what it was originally meant to be and became a mantra of cult like proportions
<Magical_pablez94> P0N-3: no ttoday streamer is Phase4- but he's not in dat room :D
<Ninjazz> Porn is porn. There is no escaping it.
<Memme> Ghosties: Yea.
<VDXRetrotainment> Ghosties: Big groups
<P0N-3> Come, my minions! Go to #Vinyl_Scratch and reqeust the ten thousand Fluttershies song! Vinyl Scratch COMMANDS YOU!
<Bronyx135> rule 34 i guess :{
<Bronyx135> :S
<Dj> im back guys and i see love and tollerence has gone out of the window
<Ghosties> 04And I'm surprised someone still remembers #Vinyl_Scratch, haha
<PartyCannon> I do :)
<Memme> Yea, lol.
<Tassadork> there are worse mantras to follow. and I do think most bronies take it seriously and aren't just repeating it
<Ninjazz> I never forget it. But it's almost never used.
<Bronyx135> when i grow up
<Dj> DO NOT MENTION RULE 34!
<Bronyx135> im gonna get spike's mustache
<Bronyx135> jk
<Magical_pablez94> Ghosties: alwys did but Phase4- is not in there:D
<Dj> ITS BAD!
<Ghosties> 04#Vinyl_Scratch used to be used a looooooooooooooot
<Bronyx135> i have one XD
<Phase4-> 00,02i thought #vinyl_scratch was still muted
<Ghosties> 04It probably is
<Ninjazz> It is/
<Phase4-> 00,02its still muted
<Ninjazz> :|
<VDXRetrotainment> Haha XD
<P0N-3> First rule about rule34 is don't CLOP! Because they you can't STOP, and you has teh shame.
<Ghosties> 04Considering we don't allow the other rooms to be opened unless on Friday evenings or for Euro streams
<Bronyx135> john madden
<Dj> any tips on how to break it to my mum im a brony?
<Memme> Dj: Don't hide it.
<Ghosties> 04Just tell her you like the show
<PartyCannon> ^
<Ninjazz> You don't need to break anything. It's not a big deal.
<DrGNs> Be casual, it's just watching a show
<Bronyx135> abrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
<Memme> My mum likes Rarity.
<Bronyx135> what?
<Dj> but i might be going to B.U.C.K
<Memme> She supports me getting Tshirts, etc.
<Ninjazz> Your mom is smart. ;)
<Bronyx135> rarity is a fashion diva
<P0N-3> The first rule about ponies is please do not try to EAT the ponies! They are here to be entertaining, they are not here to be food.
<Dj> with my mate
<Bronyx135> lol
<junh1024-XD> Drake said Chimera

<Magical_pablez94> :(
<PartyCannon> Phase4- only has voice, not op
<Bronyx135> :'(
<P0N-3> I don't know if some of you are dragons or other mosnters. But no, ponies are not food.
<Ninjazz> ..
<Ghosties> 04Spouting on not "clopping" and not eating ponies is important?
<Phase4-> 00,02i'ma stream some wut
<Ninjazz> Ikr.
<Bronyx135> AGH DONT TALK ABOUT CLOPPING
<Phase4-> 00,02not sure what this is but google told me people like it
<Memme> Why not?
<Tassadork> Bronyx135: fancy pants colours = mods
<Bronyx135> OR I WILL LITERALLY LOVE AND TOLERATE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
<P0N-3> Clopping? Who's clopping?
<Ghosties> 04Because it's starting to sound awfully inappropriate
<VDXRetrotainment> Google...
<VDXRetrotainment> Oh sh't
<AppleJackTheOneAndOn> what is diz
<P0N-3> Are YOU clopping, Bronyx135?

<VDXRetrotainment> TheRainbowDash: YOU Bought FPSes!
<Nabronyan> Herro, everypony
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek. I have no idea. They where cheap. MW3 costed 100 at EB games. 50 at JB-Hi Fi.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Lil_B! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<Magical_pablez94> Lil_B: hi there how's r day been?
<Ninjazz> Vordox... That was TheRandomkid321.
<Ninjazz> Not TheRainbowDash...
<Magical_pablez94> hi Nabronyan
<TheRainbowDash> VDXRetrotainment: ....I didn't even say a thing for the past 5 minutes, until you pinged me.
<VDXRetrotainment> Oh derp...:Ö
<TheRainbowDash> (facehoof):D
<Ninjazz> LOL
<VDXRetrotainment> TheRandomkid321: <--- THIS guy.
<VDXRetrotainment> STOP HAVING SO SAME names!
<Lil_B> TheRainbowDash Magical_pablez94 hi, my day so far was good, thanks
<Magical_pablez94> Lil_B: happy to hear this :D
<TheRainbowDash> Lil_B: Oh, good to hear then.:)
<Ninjazz> Hey Lil_B!
<Magical_pablez94> TheRainbowDash: lol
<TheRandomkid321> TheRandomkid321 has ALWAYS been my online personality.
<VDXRetrotainment> TheRandomkid321: <---THIS causes game market crash! :P
<Nabronyan> Ninjazz: /)
<TheRandomkid321> Now that my name and TheRainbowDashs names are together. I see the similarity.
<Lil_B> hi ninjazz
<Ninjazz> Nabronyan: (\
<Ninjazz> :3
<ponyloverforeva> its soo hot here
<Magical_pablez94> TheRainbowDash: almost same messages :D
<TheRandomkid321> VDXRetrotainment. Eh.
<ponyloverforeva> who lives in england
<VDXRetrotainment> TheRainbowDash: Buying FPS crashes the game market. :P
<Sundaysmile> I live in Scotland, it's like 30 degrees up here
<Sundaysmile> and has been all week
<ponyloverforeva> its 90 degress here
<ponyloverforeva> in england
<TheRandomkid321> I wonder what black ops 2 zombies will eb like.
<Sundaysmile> probably like Black OPs 1
<TheRandomkid321> I want to get some dog tags. And have my name carved into them with my knife.
<ponyloverforeva> you should see how many people are here (where i live)
<TheRandomkid321> Sundaysmile BUT INT HE FUTURE! WOAH!
<TheRainbowDash> TheRainbowDash: Coincidentally, I hate the Call of Duty series.
<TheRainbowDash> Fuck...:D
<TheRainbowDash> Why do I ping myself?:D
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Why are you talking to TheRainbowDash? :D
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I made a derp also like VDX.
<Magical_pablez94> TheRainbowDash: hahahahah epic ping fail
<Nabronyan> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I LOST MY PONYMON SAVE DATA D:
<Ninjazz> Why is room so full of DERP?! :D
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: It is derp hour, remember?
<Magical_pablez94> Nabronyan: ponymon?
<TheRandomkid321> TheRainbowDash I assume that was meant for me. I used to until my friend brought his game over. I WAS HOOKED! I like BF3 and MW3 because they really are not that similar. BF3 is slow paced and COD is fast paced.
<Lil_B> TheRainbowDash I know that feeling XD sometimes you just feel lonely and you have to ping ourself
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Oh... right! :D
<Nabronyan> Magical_pablez94: It's pokemon, with ponies.
<TheRainbowDash> Lil_B: No, I tried to ping TheRandomkid321, but I derped.
<alexxm> hey TheRandomkijd321 hows your day been

<alexxm> hey Lil_B hows your day been
<VDXRetrotainment> TheRainbowDash: NOW YOU KNOW! :P
<TheRandomkid321> alexxm filled with ouke
<TheRainbowDash> VDXRetrotainment: Ah, forgot you...:D
<Nabronyan> Magical_pablez94: Yes. There are two versions of the game right now : Dawn and Dusk
<alexxm> hope you feel better TheRandomkid321
<Lil_B> Hi alexxm was good so far, been swimming, so i finally do something for my body XD
<ZombieBrony> Eddie Izzard?
*Magical_pablez94 drools... " Nabronyan PLEASE give me the download link!!!!"
<Wrek> 05y
<TheRandomkid321> Stream aggin... Shame too... Looks funny...
<TheRandomkid321> Anyone here ever heared of Carl Baron?
<TheRainbowDash> TheRandomkid321: Ah, I can see what you're trying to say here, but I am just thinking that these games could've have much more potential. Call of Duty and Battlefield (MW3 and BF3) could've have much better, if they focused more on the multiplayer, and if big money corportaions weren't throw into play, with hype as well.
<Wrek> 05lagging for anyoen else?
<ponyloverforeva> Wreck: are you a pony? (on here)
<TheRainbowDash> Wrek: No lag for me at all.

<DitzyHooves> I liked Atlas Shrugged.... at its heart its a romance novel
<TheRainbowDash> TheRandomkid321: And that is why I don't trust big first person shooters anymore, I know already that internet connections will be bad.
<alexxm> i'm good Resonantwaves
<TheRandomkid321> Carl Barron is a really funny aussie comedian. You shoudl look him up. You may not get the jokes though.
<TheRainbowDash> Resonantwaves: Ah, doing good myself. Woke up about an hour ago, to a brand new day.:)

<BlueFlare> 02Okay, 1 drf likes all the gens before gen 5, 2 he it’s up to him whether or not he likes MLP, and everything else you just said is your opinions
<BlueFlare> 02-he
<Drake> 04BlueFlare
<Drake> 04Just
<Drake> 04don't
<Drake> 04it's not worth it
<BlueFlare> 02well I'm already done XD
<BlueFlare> 02I just had to :s
<eXAKR> Oh, so one of the generations he likes is Gen 4?
<eXAKR> The most failure gen up to now?
<eXAKR> With horrible towns and cities
<eXAKR> Horrible music
<BlueFlare> 02there's a few Pokemon in gen 4 that he likes
<eXAKR> Horrible variety
<VioletGreySha> is my chet derped?
<Lil_B> did the chat duie?
<eXAKR> Horrible UI
<Wrek> 05dunno
<VioletGreySha> lol
<TheRandomkid321> VioletGreySha Nope
<eXAKR> Horrible type diversity
<TheRandomkid321> We atre just SPIES!
<eXAKR> And all?
*Mutterguy heres the whiney of distant pnoies
<VioletGreySha> Ninjazz hrhr
<VioletGreySha> :D
<TheRainbowDash> What....:D
<Mutterguy> *hears
<Ghosties> 04Welp, I'm heading to bed folks. Have a good one
<Ninjazz> Hehehehe...
<eXAKR> If Gen 5 was bad, Famitsu wouldn't have rated it 40/40
<Ninjazz> Hai :3
<TheRainbowDash> Bye Ghosties! (waves and hugs)
<BlueFlare> 02UI Isn’t even a proper word to use in gaming
<Lil_B> good night Ghosties
<eXAKR> Just saying
<VioletGreySha> night Ghosties
<Ninjazz> Cya Ghosties! Take care!
<VDXRetrotainment> Gn Ghosties
<Mutterguy> bye Ghosties
<eXAKR> If you have both a Gen 4 and Gen 5 game, go compare
<VDXRetrotainment> Wrek, has Violet Vanilla poked around lately in here?
<eXAKR> They had a touch screen in Gen 4, and they wasted it completely, using it for gimmicks
<Mutterguy> I MISSED YOU TAB BUTTON!
<BlueFlare> 02and your not liking 4th gen is just as bad as drf not liking 5th gen
<VioletGreySha> Wrek: you ever heard from Eisbrecher? its a german band dat got some nice tunes ^^
<Drake> 04opinion
<eXAKR> Don't get me wrong. Gen 4 was cool for introducing online battles, trading, and Lucario
<Drake> 04all's said and done
<Wrek> 05ill see if i cant try
<BlueFlare> 02true Drake
<Lil_B> VDXRetrotainment the last time i saw her (and the first time) was think ether after the season finaly or at the movie night a week later
<eXAKR> But seriously, you prefer such a bad generation over one that improved on everything on the previous generation
<eXAKR> and I'm just stating plain fact
<BlueFlare> 02but eXAKR doesn't seem to know that word exist
<Lil_B> VDXRetrotainment no, i Just remembered, it was after the TOM awards
<VDXRetrotainment> Lil_B: During the anneversity
<eXAKR> *coughOnlyTwoFireTypeLinesInSinnohCoughsoughsough*
<Ninjazz> Last time I saw her was the Tom Awards
<Lil_B> VDXRetrotainment right XD
<Ninjazz> Afterwords
<eXAKR> Well, his hating of Gen 5 is based on opinion
<Drake> 04so
<Drake> 04eXAKR
<eXAKR> But mine's backed with FACTS
<Drake> 04You dislike gen 4?
<eXAKR> Not exactly, in the end
<eXAKR> I like all the gens
<eXAKR> Just felt Gen 4 was a huge disappointment given how revolutionary it could have been
<BlueFlare> 02what matters is what someone LIKES, not facts. -_-
<eXAKR> Which Gen 5 was
<Drake> 04[21:23] <eXAKR> Horrible music <- opinion
<Drake> 04[21:23] <eXAKR> With horrible towns and cities <- opinion
<eXAKR> I also liked Gen 2 and Gen 3
<BlueFlare> 02opinion^
<Wrek> 05love this guy xD
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha:D
<BlueFlare> 02[05:23] <eXAKR> Horrible variety
<BlueFlare> 02[05:24] <eXAKR> Horrible UI
<BlueFlare> 02[05:24] <eXAKR> Horrible type diversity
<Drake> 04type diversity, variety and UI I don't have an opinion on so yay
<BlueFlare> 02opinion
<TheUnnamedOC> Hello
<eXAKR> If the music was good, they wouldn't have used near-identical music for Gym Leaders and E4 battle
<Drake> 04...
<eXAKR> It's already a fail on their part
<Lil_B> hi TheUnnamedOC
<TheRainbowDash> Hello TheUnnamedOC! (waves and hugs) How are you today
<Drake> 04That
<BlueFlare> 02Assuming we care eXAKR
<Drake> 04just
<eXAKR> And it's not as if they were limited or something, like Gen 2
<Drake> 04means
<Drake> 04doesn't
<TheUnnamedOC> Quite good. And you?
<TheRainbowDash> Ah, doing good myself, thanks for asking.:)
<Drake> 04eXAKR using the same music for two types of battle doesn't make the music bad
<Ninjazz> Hello TheUnnamedOC.
<Mutterguy> We need. More Cowbell
<eXAKR> OK, how about some of the route music?
<Drake> 04eXAKR
<Mutterguy> hi TheUnnamedOC
<eXAKR> Some of it didn't fit the route at all
<Drake> 04stop trying to convince me, because I happen to agree on your dislike
<TheUnnamedOC> Hi Ninjazz and Mutterguy
<eXAKR> OK.
<Drake> 04You're just being so damn hostile
<VDXRetrotainment> Wrek: Question nr 2. You like Twi?
<Ninjazz> :)
<eXAKR> If drf can be less in-your-face about his hate of Apple, Windows Vista and above, touch, new technology, Gen 5, and MLP:FiM, I will stop being so hostile
<Drake> 04so you'll be as bad as him?
<eXAKR> His signature on the forums is so obnoxious I wince everytime I see it
<Drake> 04rather
<eXAKR> And that actually made me stop even looking at them
<Drake> 04you'll be as "allegedly" bad as him?
<BlueFlare> 02every time*
<eXAKR> I'm just giving him a taste of his own medicine
<Nabronyan> Does anyone here play PonyMon?
<TheUnnamedOC> Yeah
<Drake> 04Yes
<eXAKR> If he hates it, then tell him to stop
<Drake> 04Because that solves EVERYTHING
<Nabronyan> Is getting a Lyra early on a good idea?
<eXAKR> Then I will sop
<Wrek> 05VDXRetrotainment should be ratehr obvious
<eXAKR> *stop
<VDXRetrotainment> Good, I'll add that into the sprite then
<TheUnnamedOC> Not sure. Probably
<eXAKR> Again, my request is simple
<Nabronyan> How far are you into PonyMon?
<eXAKR> He stops being this anal
<Drake> 04I just did what I told Blueflare not to do. Fantastic.
<eXAKR> Or GTFO
<Lil_B> Nabronyan i was going to, but i wanted to wait untill its fully done
<Nabronyan> My Fluttershy is only level 8 :L
<BlueFlare> 02it's people like you that make my dislike the MLP fanbase
<BlueFlare> 02me*
<Vordox> >.>
<Mutterguy> don't think there's a mare he hasn't drawn...
<eXAKR> I'
<Lil_B> le Wild Vordox appears
<Malavolent> Is that aboy, or a girl?
<Vordox> FECK
<eXAKR> ...m not going to force people to like MLP:FiM
<Vordox> I forgot my pass
<eXAKR> But does he have to be so anal about it
<eXAKR> ?
<TheUnnamedOC> Well, uh... Still havent gotten a badge yet :$
<Lil_B> also a wiled Malavolent
<Lil_B> wild*
<eXAKR> "EW MLP" in giant typeface
<eXAKR> I still remember that
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Rawr.
<Drake> 04[21:32] <eXAKR> I'm just giving him a taste of his own medicine <-- no you're not, you're giving us a taste of his medicine.
<Nabronyan> Hey guys, Im gonna be writing a FanFic soon
<BlueFlare> 02no, he shouldn't be, but there's nothing wrong with him stating that he doesn't like it
<TheUnnamedOC> ooooo
<Nabronyan> For my OC, is Warhead an appropriate name for a nuclear scientist?
<Drake> So thanks. It tastes f*cking <censored>.
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 14 time(s).
<Lil_B> Nabronyan about what?
<Vordox> Oh thank god...Finally.
<eXAKR> I don't go "LOVE MLP:FiM OR DIE" in giant letters on the forums
<Vordox> In case people wonder...<--- VDXRetrotainment
<BlueFlare> 02you don't?
<TheUnnamedOC> Would Aladeen approve?
<Lil_B> Nabronyan depends, is he evil?
<eXAKR> Never
<BlueFlare> 02hurr
<eXAKR> Not even in my signature
<eXAKR> And I know he's watching
<Lil_B> Vordox oh XD i didn't even know that
<eXAKR> To be honest, I won't shed a tear if he dies tomorrow
<Nabronyan> He's neither. He's batshit insane, but not really EVIL.
<eXAKR> I will in fact be celebrating the death of a hater
<BlueFlare> 02..
<BlueFlare> 02okay
<BlueFlare> 02now
<Drake> 04yeah that's really extreme
<BlueFlare> 02that is just
<Wrek> 05but yeah vordox you bailed on a chance to meet me then :P
<BlueFlare> 02yeah
<eXAKR> Now let's see how he likes that
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Lighty10) 11WB10»11•. 10- i sooo love e-mail, i win atleast 5 cars everyday
<TheUnnamedOC> Bipolar insane or just flat-out crazy?
<Drake> 04so
<Lil_B> Nabronyan I (personaly, you name him how you want to name him) would name him somthing like "Dr. Insano" but this name is already in use by someone else
<Drake> 04eXARK
<Drake> 04You're intentionally saying that to provoke him?
<Nabronyan> He's Bipolar insane, but he's crazy most of the time.
<eXAKR> He has said a lot of provocative things
<eXAKR> Done a lot of provocative actions
<eXAKR> To make us all hate him
<Drake> 04You're intentionally riling him up, "giving him a taste of his own medicine" based on the fact that you think he might be watching?
<TheUnnamedOC> Not good at this... All I can come up with is Split Atom
<BlueFlare> 02He’s not a “hater” he just has strong opinions like a lot of people.
<MadSurge> Silly insane?
<Nabronyan> Split Atom sounds nice
<eXAKR> Strong opinions doesn't entitle you to rub it in other's faces
<eXAKR> Hawkie hated him
<eXAKR> Roara hated him
<Nabronyan> I'll choose between that and Warhead.
<eXAKR> He started a war here over a simple typo
<eXAKR> "yuu"
<TheUnnamedOC> Thanks :)
*Nabronyan Engages serious thinking face while deciding between the two names
<TheUnnamedOC> *Jeoprady theme begins to play
<eXAKR> You know why I wasn't around for some time?
<eXAKR> Just to see if he has left this place
<Drake> 04eXAKR
<Drake> 04answer my question please.
<Lil_B> Nabronyan you have to sit down and get into the "The Thinker" position
<Wrek> 05am i the only one paying attention to the stream? xD
<eXAKR> You're intentionally riling him up, "giving him a taste of his own medicine" based on the fact that you think he might be watching? <- Yes.
<TheUnnamedOC> I am trying. Who is that?
<eXAKR> I know he logs everything
*Nabronyan Gets into the Thinker Position, maintaining the universe-eating serious face that will destroy the universe if maintained too long
<Lil_B> Wrek sorry, I'm not that kind of Standup-Comedy guy XD
<Wrek> 05Eddie Izzard
<eXAKR> I want him to know my feelings for him
<eXAKR> and a few other people I know
<Irish_Pony> Hello all :$
<BlueFlare> 02Assuming he cares?
<BlueFlare> 02he shouldn't
<BlueFlare> 02if you ask me
<TheUnnamedOC> Wat 6_9 I always though he was black...
<Nabronyan> Hello Irish_Pony. :|
<eXAKR> He will
<eXAKR> Trust me
<Lil_B> Greetings Irish_Pony
<eXAKR> Then he will whine to Ascendant about it
<TheUnnamedOC> Hello there Irish
<Ninjazz> Hey Irish_Pony!
<eXAKR> Who's defending him every step of the way
<Drake> 04eXAKR I'm sure he already knows how much you dislike him. I'm fairly sure we all do.
<Nabronyan> Also, does anyone want to see the pony design Im using for Split Atom?
<Lighty> Oh gawd, not another fight eh? .-.
<eXAKR> I want that fact drilled into his head
<BlueFlare> 02Also, stop putting words in other people’s mouths eXAKR
<Vordox> Wrek: Question nr 3: If you draw ponified, how do you draw to a canvas? :P
<TheUnnamedOC> Very much
<eXAKR> and get him to either stop or GTFO
<BlueFlare> 02[05:37] <eXAKR> Hawkie hated him
<BlueFlare> 02[05:37] <eXAKR> Roara hated him
<Nabronyan> I'll have to send it through Private Message, because it's made from pony creator on DeviantArt
<Vordox> Mouth, hoof, standing, normal pose etc.
<Nabronyan> And has a long code.
<eXAKR> Hawkie told me that in a PM ages ago
<TheUnnamedOC> k
<eXAKR> Wonder why she's not here much anymore?
<Wrek> 05what?
<eXAKR> Not even on the server?
<Drake> 04...
<eXAKR> And Roara
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04ok
<Vordox> Wrek trying to come up with a sprite to add to Desktop Ponies, and you are the current one in mind
<Drake> 04I'm done with this.
<eXAKR> Roara loved Gen 5
<Vordox> So trying to igure out an animation of you drawing on a canvas
<Irish_Pony> Nabronyan: May I ask why you made that face when you said hello to me?
<Drake> 04I shoulda just kept my mouth shut
<eXAKR> drf hated her because of it
<BlueFlare> 02right eXAKR
<Lighty> Come on guys, pointless fights are pointless, peace and freinds before fights ._.
<Vordox> I'm just wonderinf, what pose do you do if you were ponified, while drawing on a canvas.
<Wrek> 05i jsut didnt understand the question
<eXAKR> Anyway I'm done
<Vordox> Still donät? XD
<BlueFlare> 02drf doesn't hate anyone because of that
<Nabronyan> I was thinking.
<eXAKR> Now I will sit back and see drf go whine to Ascendant
<Wrek> 05vad vill du veta?
<BlueFlare> 02and Roara knows that
<eXAKR> Then I wait for her to threaten me
<Nabronyan> My Thinking face is similar to that one.
<BlueFlare> 02unlike you
<Vordox> Wrek: Ska göra sprites animation av Wrek som ponifierad, så jag undrar vilken pose skulle du göra om du var en pony för att rita på en kanvas.
<Vordox> To add to Desktop Ponies
<Lighty> I think drf is a nice and helpfull guy, ofcourse he has his "bad habits"
<Lighty> But im sure everyone has, right?
<Vordox> There's too many ways of doing it, so Just want a general position of it.
<derpy_pony> hey
<Vordox> Or a suggestion
<derpy_pony> this guy again
<Wrek> 05hade lagt undan ciggen i askfatet, tagit en pensel i munnen och målat, sen lägga bort pänseln och plocka upp ciggen igen
<Wrek> 05eller nått :|
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> Weird question I know.
<Wrek> 05no shit
<Vordox> But gotcha, noted.
<Vordox> Never been sprited before, have ye? :P
<Wrek> 05nope
<Vordox> Well I'll add some flare to it then.
<BlueFlare> 02pretty much
<Nabronyan> Hold up
<Nabronyan> Desktop ponies? I want them :o
<Vordox> You had the same reaction as Phase4 and Silverscreen
<Vordox> Going alittle "Wtf is he talking about" :P
<Wrek> 05was easier in swedish tbo :P
<Irish_Pony> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d51d9yo Hhhhhhhhhnngggggggggggggg
<Vordox> Wrek: My swedish is worse then my English :P
<Wrek> 05yet i udnerstood yer point better
<Vordox> Aye...Not a good sign
<Vordox> Fourth question now? :P
<BlueFlare> 02we have already said what needs to be said eXAKR
<Wrek> 05y
<Lighty> Ok, how about more directly, stop fighting please? Last time i did i got threatend with a ban btw....it would be smart if you guys could stop the drama
<Wrek> 05dracula, or dracul, or drac or D
<Vordox> Hur skulle du stå, som en pony, när du ritar, halvsittande, stående, 2 ben etc?
<BlueFlare> 02hurr
<Ascendant> I'm already bored of watching
<Vordox> That's the tough one as I need a suggestion for it.
<Ascendant> And I've been here for less than a minute
<Irish_Pony> dat text that i cant read :P
<Vordox> Irish_Pony: It's just to get one point across, it's nothing vital. :) Sorry for using another language in Chat.
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: It made me go derp as well.:D
<Ninjazz> If it's cool with Wrek, it's cool with us.
<Ascendant> come on, if you want to drama, you can at least make it popcorn-worthy drama ):
<BlueFlare> 02lmao
<Wrek> 05stående, kasnke lyfter en hov. pausar imellanåt och tittar snabbt på vad jag ritat hittils. vinklar huvudet lite a la en hund och sen fortsätter. med en lite frågande min.
<Wrek> 05and yeh
<Wrek> 05if that makes sense
<Vordox> It does.
<Vordox> Thank you. :) That should be all I need then!
<Lighty> Yea, drama can be amuzing, but this sucks .-.
<Lighty> Derp derpadie derp
<BlueFlare> 02well, I could have rage quit, but then I wouldn't be here to see the drama :<
<derpy_pony> what kind of interview is this?
<Vordox> Now let's see how long it takes to do one animation...>.>
<Vordox> Brb 2 years XD
<Wrek> 05heeh
<Wrek> 05dont forget to show me ;3
<Ascendant> Lighty, I was hoping to have some laughs ):
<Lighty> Id think if close freinds/close members would get banned, the whole community would go
<Vordox> Wrek: It'll take a while, just doing Violet's ONE animation took 5 days. ><
<Vordox> And you've seen it I think
<Vordox> <.<
<Lighty> JffibsjgiysdbfkgndkgjdngkdngWTF?!
<Wrek> 05nope
<Vordox> Oh.
<Vordox> Er..
<Vordox> Well, when she gets back, she can show it herself XD
<Vordox> Dat kick
<Irish_Pony> inb4 kick
<Ascendant> hey, no one cared when I was banned
*Ascendant sobs
<Ascendant> bawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Y U ALL NO CARE
<Lighty> You were banned?
<BlueFlare> 02The last thing I’ll say it this: eXAKR assumes we even take him seriously.
<Lighty> Who would be that stupid?
<BlueFlare> 02is*
<BlueFlare> 02derp
<Lighty> ...
<Lighty> Nah

<Ascendant> ;_.
<Xanbreon> Its just, linux dropbox sucks dicks

<Xanbreon> Okies, where the hell did I get a Plants vs Zombies wallpaper

<Ascendant> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17036030/wet_pussies.jpg
<Ninjazz> Why you guys doing that this early?
<Xanbreon> :D
<Xanbreon> <3
<Ascendant> XD
<Xanbreon> Sexy
<Ascendant> but yeah
<Xanbreon> http://i.imgur.com/dTl0X.jpg
<Ascendant> 13 is out
<Ascendant> I want to get it
<Xanbreon> I dont even know wtf that came from
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Wait, what do you mean by that?
<Xanbreon> Dist upgrade should work fine
<Ninjazz> It's too early!
<Ascendant> Xanbreon
<MadSurge> Is it 5 in the morning over there?
<Ascendant> linux mint
<Ninjazz> Well...
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: It is never too early, nor too late for that stuff.
<Ninjazz> No.
<Ascendant> basically, upgrading is reinstalling the entire f*cking system
<Xanbreon> What, really?
<Ascendant> Yes
<Ascendant> and doing it via apt is crappy
<Ninjazz> Okay, fine.... Go eat each other's ear then. -_-
<Xanbreon> Its based on ubuntu/debian, and they forgot to kang the upgrade system?
<Ascendant> cus' it layers
<Ascendant> instead of replacing everything
<TheRainbowDash> (nibbles on Ninjazz's ear)
<Xanbreon> Wowww
<Ninjazz> O_O
<Ascendant> it's like a system gnome-shell
<Irish_Pony> xD
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha:D
<Ascendant> means I need to backup my data
<Xanbreon> Mints more retarded than i though then
<Ninjazz> -_-
<Ascendant> install mint 13
<Wrek> 05ahem
<Ascendant> then move everything back on
<Ascendant> and reinstall all the stuff I installed via apt
<VioletGreySha> well i go and sleep night everypony
<Xanbreon> Even Ubuntu can dist upgrade
<Ascendant> x_X
<Xanbreon> :(
<Ascendant> ubuntu is crap though
<TheRainbowDash> Bye VioletGreySha! (waves and hugs)
<Ninjazz> Night, VioletGreySha! :3
<VioletGreySha> sleeping at 2pm hrhr
<MadSurge> *eats all TheRainbowDash's ties*
<Ascendant> and are you using arch or something?
<TheRainbowDash> My ties? why?
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Ascendant> debian
<Ascendant> with gnome 2?
<Xanbreon> xfce
<Ascendant> Ah yeah xfce
<Xanbreon> Have you tried apt-get dist-upgrade
<Xanbreon> Cos the interwebs are telling me that it should work
<Ascendant> that
<Ascendant> just installs the new kernels
<Ninjazz> Do you even wear ties?
<Xanbreon> No?
<MadSurge> I'm a goat, baaa
*Irish_Pony takes a nap in his barrel
<TheRainbowDash> Ummm, no, not at all.
<Xanbreon> Unless mint is really retarded
<Ninjazz> Okay... :S
<Ascendant> no lol
<Xanbreon> It should set the system to upgrade to a newer version
<Ascendant> I did dist-upgrade earlier
<Ascendant> dist-upgrade updates the kernel version on mint
*Ninjazz backflips onto the ceiling
<Ascendant> like linux-generic-headers linux-headers etc.
<Ascendant> Calculating upgrade... Done
<Ascendant> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
<Ninjazz> Guess... I'll just wait here.
<Ascendant> that
<Ascendant> lol
<Xanbreon> Whaaatttttt
<Ascendant> the only reason why I'm using min
<TheRainbowDash> (drops the ceiling down onto the floor, 100 feet below)
<Ascendant> mint
<Ascendant> is because of the interface
<Ninjazz> -_-
<Ascendant> otherwise I'd use debian with xfce
<TheRainbowDash> I am silly filly.
<Ascendant> or gentoo even
<TheRainbowDash> :P
<Xanbreon> So basically, the only way to upgrade mint, is to wipe it out and reinstall?
<Ascendant> but I can't deal with emerge
<Ascendant> well
<Ninjazz> You are a mean silly filly. -_-
<Ascendant> you can do the apt-get method
<Xanbreon> Thats <censored> stupid
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 103 time(s).
<TheRainbowDash> What? Mean?
<Ascendant> but as I said
<Ascendant> that only layers the new OS
<Ascendant> instead of installing it
<Ascendant> it's like a system gnome-shell
*Ninjazz slids across wooden floor in underwear
<Xanbreon> Yeeehh
<Twi_Fi> wut
<TheRainbowDash> (removes the flooring)
<Irish_Pony> With sunglasses?
<Ninjazz> HELLL YEAH!
<Wrek> 05no rp you two
<Ascendant> which is silly
<Ascendant> and I don't want that
<Ninjazz> Damn it.
<TheRainbowDash> Aww....:<:D
<Ninjazz> Alright.
<Ascendant> 1. waste of space and 2. I want mint 13 not mint 12 and a half
<Wrek> 05seriously ts againts the rules and if you dotn start takign that seriously you'll just get in trouble
<Xanbreon> I dont see why they b0rked dist upgrade
<Xanbreon> >_>
<Ascendant> idk either
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, rping is illegal, you know!
<Xanbreon> Idiots
<Ascendant> but I'm going to have to bloody reinstall
<Ninjazz> Twas just light RP, but okay Wrek.
<Ninjazz> I get it.
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Look to the pony who's talkinb about that.
<Ascendant> but this gives me a chance to format the swap partition as well
<Ascendant> and move it down to something like 2GB
<Twi_Fi> :$
<Ascendant> instead of 8GB
<Ascendant> who the HELL needs 2GB of swap
<Xanbreon> LVM! :D
<Deadeagle> is wrek drawing?
<Ascendant> also
<Xanbreon> You mostly need 1:1 swap if you want to suspend
<Deadeagle> lol
<Ascendant> x_x
<TheRainbowDash> Deadeagle: No, he is not drawing.
<Ninjazz> Hopefully.
<Ascendant> I haven't used standby
<Ascendant> ever
<Ascendant> I never use standby
<Twi_Fi> He is drawing a carrot.
<Ascendant> on mint
<Xanbreon> Then you dont need 1:1 swap
<Twi_Fi> And it will be EPIC!
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Angel wants that carrot.
<Deadeagle> is anyone even streaming? or is it just random music XD
<Ascendant> I've had bad experiences with standby
<Ascendant> >_>
<Ascendant> on my old laptop
<Xanbreon> Its a pita
<Ascendant> if I put it on standby while on the charger
<TheRainbowDash> Deadeagle: Pretty much just random music I guess.
<Ascendant> and then unplug the charger
<Xanbreon> If you have iffy drivers
<Twi_Fi> The random music is the stream.
<Ascendant> it'd fry the motherboard
<Twi_Fi> As well as ponies!
<Xanbreon> roflol
<Ascendant> which I then had to get replaced
<Irish_Pony> Im actaully ignoring the stream, in a different tab im listening to Marine Cadences
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Ah, forgot about the ponies.
<Ninjazz> We get Twilight Sparkle... So all bad I guess. (Needs more damn Rarity, damn it)
<Ninjazz> Not*
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Wow, that dedication for Rarity man, a lot.
<Twi_Fi> My wrath as about to descend upon you Ninjazz.
<Ascendant> and linux generally doesn't like standby anyway
<Twi_Fi> *was
<Ascendant> also 8GB swap is a waste of disk space
<Ascendant> >_>
<Phase4> 00,02someone dinged me
<Ninjazz> Twi_Fi: A simple typo, my friend. :$
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox it seems
<Spell-of-Gaming> Holy crap...
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz: :)
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Vordox
<Xanbreon> I have 2 I think
<Vordox> <.< I've been here the whole time Phase. :p
*Twi_Fi waits for Spell-of-Gaming to elaborate.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I love her as much as you love Dashie, perhaps not as... You know... But STILL I LOVE HER! :$
<Xanbreon> If needs be I can shrink it and chuck it into my / or /home
<Xanbreon> <3 LVM
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...my country's Cartoon Network is showing Total Drama Island.
<VDXRetrotainment> Hai Phase again :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> Waaaa
<Ascendant> I should repartition
<Spell-of-Gaming> I've seen it
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: My wub for Dashie, you'll never understand how much it is.
<Ascendant> and have /home as a separate partition
<Ascendant> so I can upgrade
<Spell-of-Gaming> And frankly, it sucks
<Xanbreon> Yes, yes you should
<Ascendant> without needing to do that backup and move
<Ascendant> except that's a bit painful
<Wrek> 05brb
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: You've told me all about it. I think I can paint a picture.
<Vordox> <--- Same as VDXRetrotainment
<TheRainbowDash> Spell-of-Gaming: I saw the first season, it was pretty good, and then it got redundant after that.
<Xanbreon> Wait, mint makes everything one big blob?
<Ascendant> how much should I need for /
<Xanbreon> My / is 8gig atm
<Ninjazz> Aye.
<Ascendant> no lol, I just didn't partition it to have separate stuff
<Xanbreon> Im using 5.25gig
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh, right but it a lot more that I haven't told you, that will keep secret.
<Ascendant> fair enough
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Yowza.
<Ascendant> I don't think I'd need more than 10GB for / anyway
<Xanbreon> Gnome would use another gig
<TheRainbowDash> What kind of word is "yowza"?
<Xanbreon> As I said, LVM
<Ninjazz> Say it.
<Xanbreon> Then if you need more space
<TheRainbowDash> Nope.
<Xanbreon> Its really easy to add moar
<Ninjazz> -_-
<Xanbreon> :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm waiting for myself to play all Key's "dating sims"
<Twi_Fi> Wrek is gone, time for rp.
<Ninjazz> Nvm
<Ascendant> I'm far to lazy to set LVM up x_X
<Ascendant> + LVM takes up space of its own
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I mean... If there is more to it than what you have already told me... You should either tell me or never mention it again. :S
<Xanbreon> Nothing worth bothering about
<Ascendant> I think I'll probably only need /, /home and swap
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: There are 4 other mods who may be watching, with the excludment of Tom, because that bro is a bot.
<Ascendant> can't remember what else
<Xanbreon> Mint installer cant do LVM?
<Xanbreon> >_<
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I'll never mention it, there.
<Ascendant> idk
<Ascendant> I haven't tried LVM
<Ascendant> on mint
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, that is why I didn't do anything.
<Ninjazz> noted.
*Irish_Pony is ignoring the chat like a boss
<Ascendant> and I haven't used LVM for ages
<Twi_Fi> I am scared.
<Xanbreon> Mhhm
<TheRainbowDash> Scared of what?
<Ninjazz> Ghosties.
<Twi_Fi> Yes
<TheRainbowDash> Not the ghosties again...:D
<Ascendant> I think /, /home and swap
<Irish_Pony> Who you gonna call?
<Ninjazz> You know what you must do. :|
<Michel> !xanbreon
<Twi_Fi> Ghosties popping in, with his blood red text.....
<TheRainbowDash> We need to giggle and laugh them out of here, when they enter.
<Michel> :)
<Ascendant> or I could have /var as well
<Ascendant> but that's a bit redundant
*Xanbreon nuzzles Michel
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I got it under control.
<Ninjazz> Ghostiesbusters. Who giggle the ghosts into packs.
<Xanbreon> Meh, I would just do / /home and swap
<Michel> tonight: dd or lol? :P
<Twi_Fi> As soon as I see ghosties' text I imagine dripping blood.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh, i thought you meant take my sword, nevermind.
<Mutterguy> night all
<Ascendant> I could also do /dev
<Ninjazz> I'll let you handle everything then, TheRainbowDash.
<ImOkayWithThis> the rain destroyed my books
<Twi_Fi> Night Mutterguy
<Xanbreon> Tonight Im going to a mates, his sister bday
<Ascendant> but that's lame
<Ninjazz> Gnight Mutterguy!
<Xanbreon> Thus i will be very wasted
<TheRainbowDash> Bye Mutterguy! (waves and hugs)(
<Xanbreon> Bah
<Ninjazz> RP!
<Ascendant> what filesystems do I set them as, Xanbreon?
<Xanbreon> Ext4
<Xanbreon> Oh
<Xanbreon> Do a /boot as well
<Ninjazz> So... I think I need a shower.
<Ninjazz> Yeah... I do.
*ImOkayWithThis throws a bucket at Ninjazz
<Twi_Fi> Neigh!
<Ninjazz> =_=
*Irish_Pony starts doing random push ups
<Vordox> Wrek, is it okay if I follow your unconventional style within the DP?
<Michel> aw oki
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: A shower? Let me join in with you.
<Baka-Neku> http://baka-neku.deviantart.com/#/d51bc7l my newest vector :3
<Ninjazz> o_o
<Vordox> Your style is more stylizzed, but I'm not sure it'll be within the general term of what the ponies in DP is.
*Michel gives Xanbreon a few shoes "tehere are da boots!" :)
<Ninjazz> Daaaww Baka-Neku
<TheRainbowDash> Baka-Neku: D'awww....*dies of d'awness syndrome*
<Irish_Pony> Ninjazz: I wouldnt question it, i would just go with it ;)
<Xanbreon> But make sure its the first partition on the disk
<Baka-Neku> Ninjazz: TheRainbowDash: thanks =D =D
<Ninjazz> Of course, you would, Irish_Pony.
<Ascendant> oh yeah /boot
<Ninjazz> Once I get into my groove, I will.
<TheRainbowDash> Irish_Pony: Hmm?
<Twi_Fi> Baka-Neku: I like the comment below the picture about "ponies again."
*Ascendant facepalms
<Ascendant> can't believe I forgot about that
<Ascendant> oh yeah Xanbreon
*Irish_Pony lays back in his barrel
<Ascendant> do I put that in front of Windows' partition as well?
<Baka-Neku> Twi_Fi: i know XD i think it's some random dude XD i have no clue who it is XD
*Xanbreon cuddles Michel
<Xanbreon> Could do some DD or LoL in a little, unno, you busy
<Xanbreon> ?
<Xanbreon> Das boot
<Xanbreon> :3
<TheRainbowDash> I just have this sudden urge to...
<Michel> good song :P
<Michel> never seen the movie
<Michel> hrm
<Twi_Fi> Baka-Neku: Oh, I also like the pic too, btw.

<Wrek> 05how so?
<|Discord|> Just the way you said it
<Woodenfan> eeyup good one Wrek. Wait, you were addicted to cocaine? maaaaaan

<|Discord|> Or where you serious?
<Wrek> 05nah, ponies and metal
<Wrek> 05and nicotine
<Ninjazz> PONIES. AND METAL.
<TheRainbowDash> Lots of it.

<Twi_Fi> Ponies and bronze!
<Malavolent> Perfectly fine with me.
<Ninjazz> And for myself... COFFEE!
<Twi_Fi> wait......
<|Discord|> Ninjazz: A very expected combination none the less

<Wrek> 05folkmetal is my metal
<Wrek> 05cause i keep goign back to it
<Ninjazz> And don't you dare be taking my coffee, TheRainbowDash. :|
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: How can I? I already did.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: If there is a will. There is a way. :>
<kenne> coffee, do not want
<TheRainbowDash> Yes, now a soothing song, I hope...:D
<Malavolent> Eww, cofee.
<Malavolent> It never tasted good to me.
<Ninjazz> -_-
<kenne> TheRainbowDash: dont count on it
<Malavolent> As well as any kind of alcohol.
<Ninjazz> You folks crazy.
<TheRainbowDash> Nevermind.
<Wrek> 05mmmm coffeeeeeee
<Ninjazz> There is is.
<Ninjazz> Wrek: (\
<Monfang> Any chance anyone here knows how to fix laptops?
<Wrek> 05 /)
<ImOkayWithThis> Ninjazz: Im not crazy man, get it right i'm Insane
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ugh....
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: You have 5 seconds to tell me one thing coffee gives me and chocolate milk don't.
<Wrek> 05is it an IBM/lenovo?
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: A good morning.
<Wrek> 05and is it a hardware failiure or software failiure?
<Monfang> I have a key that refuses to work unless I push it ddddddownd rdeally hardddddddddddddddddddd (But you see what happens.)
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: What the matter?
<kenne> Malavolent: caffine, still dont like coffee though
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ah, forget it.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: I don't think so. Every morning is good with hot chocolate milk.
<Ninjazz> ImOkayWithThis: Noted.
<Wrek> 05hardware failiure then
<Wrek> 05now
<Wrek> 05what brand is the laptop?
<Monfang> emachine E525 series
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Depends who enjoys it, then. Perhaps its better that you don't even start. Buuuuuuuut, I love it.
<Wrek> 05ok you can service it and get the keboard replaced
<Wrek> 05or you getr a cheap keyboard that you use instead
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Well, I've tried it, but like I said, it never tasted good to me. Neither does alcohol. I'm going to save sooo much money.
<Lil_B> Me no like coffee, but i prever milk in the morning (because I'm too lazy to pour the Cacao in at and heat it up)
<Monfang> I alreay trie cleaning it. Blew into a straw to get the gunk out. Not work for long until it broke again. No money for replacement.
<Wrek> 05potential risks with turnign it in is that you spend money and get afull servie and end up getting your HD wiped
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Ever tried putting milk or sugar into it?
<Ninjazz> Cream*
<Lil_B> Monfang: how old is it?
<Monfang> Less than a few years
<Ninjazz> Dafuq did i get milk from?
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: I wouldn't even try it without sugar, but I've never tried it with cream, to be honest.
<Malavolent> Is it that different?
<Monfang> But I game aggressively.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Much different.
<Wrek> 05i pity ragegamers
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Ok, I'll give it a try someday.
<Monfang> Not rage
<Wrek> 05so much wasted money
<Monfang> I put a lot of energy into it.
<Malavolent> Wrek: Who is a ragegamer by your definition?
<Capn_Gavn> i once punced a keyboard in the spacebar when i wouldnt jump in tf2
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Just try to balance the sugar with the cream. Sometimes it just comes to you what works best.
<Wrek> 05the whole group? people who use uneccesary force in their keypushing
<Wrek> 05but then theres the cathergories
<Wrek> 05all form the ones that break their keyboard in hald and pulls the plug
<Wrek> 05and so on
<Capn_Gavn> used blu tack and a lillipop stick to repair it
<Capn_Gavn> lollipop*
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Ok, you're responsible for my possible obsession with coffee then :)
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: Noted. :)
<Woodenfan> ugh. I died in IWTBTG...again
<Malavolent> Wrek: Oh, these people :D
<Monfang> I never thought I hit too much. But it explains why my mouse is having similar problems
<Wrek> 05now
<Wrek> 05looking at the keyboard
<Monfang> Typing without one letter is not easy
<Wrek> 05it seems like repairing it would require some finesse
<Lil_B> Monfang: if you can't somehow get the key to work again, then i think you could try this, if you think you can handle such a thing:
<Malavolent> My keyboard is anything but clean...
<Wrek> 05if you remove the faulty button there should be a rubber surface udnerneath that is the actuall button
<Woodenfan> guys what do the different servers do per se?
<Wrek> 05a knob per se
<Monfang> Wrek: I know how to take a laptop apart. I just feel that is excessive. Ya, I know.
<Woodenfan> oh
<Lil_B> Monfang open up the laptop, disconnect the Keyboard from the motherboard and try to use a other Keyboard (USB or PS2[not the console])
<Wrek> 05now if this blob is not coming back up when pushed down, or needs to be pushed down hard
<Wrek> 05you need to repair the rubber thingy which is hard
<Monfang> Push hardddd
<Wrek> 05otherwise if its the feathering of the plastic that is borked
<Wrek> 05jsut get a spring in there
<Malavolent> Accidentally learning.
<Woodenfan> back
<Wrek> 05Lil_B: apparently he didnt have anotehr keyboard/could afford one
<Monfang> I can push it all the way. Just have to push and hold to get ti to type, then it types a string of letters.
<Wrek> 05sounds liek the string in the rubber is glitching out
<Wrek> 05metal string*
<Wrek> 05wire
<Wrek> 05w/e
<TheRainbowDash> Ah, got to nom for a while everypony, be right back in about 15-25 minutes.
<Monfang> How remove the key?
<Ninjazz> Cya Dashie!
<Wrek> 05depends on the keyboard
<Ninjazz> Go nom some toast!
<Wrek> 05soem you can pry off
<Wrek> 05some have a delicate bounceback plasting thingy that you MUSNT break
<Monfang> It work when I clean it for a time. Why is that?
<Wrek> 05defien clean it
<Wrek> 05fine*
<Monfang> I clean it. It work but stops later on.
<Malavolent> Yo, Ninjazz ?
<Wrek> 05i dont know what you mean with cleanign it
<Ninjazz> Sup.
<Wrek> 05what exactly do you do
<Malavolent> Where are you from anyway?
<Xanbreon> !espeon

<Malavolent> Ok, I'll ask different, what nationality are you?
<Ninjazz> American.
<Monfang> ((Typing without using the 'd' key is hard)
<Malavolent> Oh... okay :D
<Wrek> 05i think its the tapping that "helps" it then
<Monfang> Let me test
<Twi_Fi> Tapping is magic.
<Ninjazz> Surprised?

*Espeon still belongs to Xanbreon for 1 more minute
<Monfang> still not working
<Xanbreon> Mine!
<Xanbreon> >;3
<Wrek> 05have a hard time thinking its due to a loose wire or something. my best guess right now is that the wiring inside the keyboard silica is either damaged or glapping on the D key for some reason.

<Espeon> booooooop
<Wrek> 05my tip to you monfang is to get an external keyboard
<Xanbreon> Damn dirty aus trolols
<Wrek> 05that is cheap so you atleast have a workign set of keys
<Derpy_Hooves> I RETURN
<kenne> welcome back Derpy_Hooves
<Wrek> 05disconnect the built in keyboard and try to find whats wrong.
<Monfang> I'll try that when I can.
<Wrek> 05cause i suspect you dont want to turn it in so i present the alternatives i can think of
<Ascendant> XD
<Capn_Gavn> on screen keybord?
<Monfang> For now, I push dddddddddddddddown hardddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
<Capn_Gavn> clunky but useful enough
<Monfang> not for gaming
<Ninjazz> How long do you hold that down, Monfang?
<Capn_Gavn> true :P
<Nerom> Ohh Laptop keyboards are a derp to fix.

<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Yes, I wub it.
<Twi_Fi> TheRainbowDash: Then it's bad for you.
<Capn_Gavn> and if i click too hard it stops registering the click
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Tell me why.
<kenne> Lil_B: i know that feel
<Twi_Fi> TheRainbowDash: Because anything we enjoy must be bad for us.
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Yeah, like ponies, they are bad then.
<Ninjazz> Yes, they are.
<Ninjazz> Oh so bad~
<Wrek> 05a mouse and keyboard, for them to last, requires a delicate touch
<TheRainbowDash> o_o, really?
<Magical_pablez94> my father needs the computer... gotta go... cya later :D
<Ninjazz> Depends on how you look at them. :D
<Twi_Fi> My life expectancy has decreased dramatically due to my love of MLP.
<Malavolent> Wrek: A delicate touch of hammer.
<Monfang> I don't do well with delicate
<Wrek> 05a twilight hammer
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I look at them from a general standpoint, not including of internet terms and inequals.
<OctaviaChaser> teh|Spitfire: hey hey.... who said you could go on WoW?
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I look at them from every standpoint possible, opens the eyes a bit.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Then they are some of the worst things ever to spawn out of a person't mind.
<teh|Spitfire> OctaviaChaser: alchemy my friend
<TheRainbowDash> (person's)
<Nerom> Wrek wanna know whats a bummer to fix?.. A drawing tablet now thats hard :O
<GarrettBrony> who wants to play the orange box?
<kenne> im gunna find it hard to leave this place to go back and play maginobi
<Wrek> 05if the sensor fries, you're fucked Nerom :P
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: The internet, in general, has some of the worse things imaginable at anyone's fingertips just waiting to be accessed and ruin someone's day or life. :S
<Nerom> Indeed
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Well, forget the internet then.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Hell no.
<TheRainbowDash> :<, why not?
<Ninjazz> BECAUSE PONIES! :D
<Malavolent> Wrek: What tablet are you using again?

<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: That's a contradiction you made upon yourself.:D
<Malavolent> What brand?
<Wrek> 05wacom
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: I didn't say I didn't like having bad things. :P
<Malavolent> Thanks, they're only selling god forsaken Genius tablets here :|
<Capn_Gavn> I can smell my mum cookng the dinner and its drivin me crazeh
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh...derp.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: But some shit is pretty bad and shouldn't be watched too long. :S

<Wrek> 05the tips burn a bit fast
<Wrek> 05but good thign there's replacements
<Nerom> Only set back
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Some of the stuff on 4chan is a good example, not going any further cause I'm feeling pretty good right now.
<Nerom> and tips a cheap
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz: Do go on.
<Ninjazz> Twi_Fi: Not tonight.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Ah, I don't even go there, so one point for me.
<Ninjazz> :>
<Twi_Fi> I've heard that 4chan makes a lot of toast.
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Wait, really?!
<Ninjazz> Now you just baiting. :D
<TheRainbowDash> I wub toast, so that means...(brain trying to compute, pushing my hooves together)
*Ninjazz is getting tired
<TheRainbowDash> I go to go on 4chan then Twi_Fi?
<Twi_Fi> TheRainbowDash: Yep :)
<Wrek> 05this song was rather nice :3
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Go to Ponychan, much better alternative.
<flutter_spin> whatup
<flutter_spin> hey wrek
<Ninjazz> Hey flutter_spin!

<TheRainbowDash> Hello flutter_spin! (waves and hugs) How are you today? And cool, a fanfic? Awesoem!
<TheRainbowDash> (awesome)
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Serriously, Dashie, 4chan ain't no place for unprotected minds.
<flutter_spin> Yeah, a sequel to my first one "Drocsid"
<MadSurge> 4chan needs strong minds to be resisted/ not severely grossed out.
<flutter_spin> It has Wrek, SB, Sumica, DeathStar in it
<Nerom> Damn I hate whn my chat stops working for no reason
<flutter_spin> Oh and me as Moonlight Sonata
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: My head is protected, and I can handle anything that anyone throws at me.:)
<Wrek> 05so flutter_spin: i look forward to reading that chapter xD
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Tally Hooooooooo, then. :3
<flutter_spin> lol, I hope I captivate your essence
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: ...i just don't really feel like it now.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: *pats head* Alright then.
<Nerom> So wrek a question what is your fave nib to the tablet pen :P
<TheRainbowDash> *is patted* Cool.
<flutter_spin> I sort of want to write another one, but frankly I'm kind of bored.
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<flutter_spin> I wanted to do something in which Sumica was some sort of awesome pegasus fight against Chyrsalis
<flutter_spin> but eh.
<the> hay ppl waz up
<Ninjazz> Hello FillyFlam.
<Ninjazz> Hello the
<Twi_Fi> Hello FillyFlam and the.
<Twi_Fi> brb, gtggssf711.

<Woodenfan> I'm ready to kill my torrent
<Ninjazz> So... I just got a complement on my bio again... Wow...
<flutter_spin> Have his paintings come to life or something. That would be cool
<Wrek> 05to defeat chrysalis i painted ragnaros
<theliving> hay ppl
<flutter_spin> lol
<Wrek> 05and to get rid of ragnaros i painted 10/25 people
<flutter_spin> I shall put that in my notes
<Nerom> With epic gear?
<Ninjazz> And we have drawing stream.
<flutter_spin> So anyone else want to be included if I make another fanfic?
<Ninjazz> flutter_spin: Can I be in it? Even though you barely know me? :$
<flutter_spin> Just need some pic/idea/name
<flutter_spin> And it can't be NinjaTheAwesome
<Ninjazz> Ninjazz is fine.
<flutter_spin> I don't even know what that means :P
<Ninjazz> Ninja + Jazz :D
<TheRainbowDash> flutter_spin: Yeah, something about jazz musiv, while holding swords and stuff, like ninjas.
<flutter_spin> Can't I name ya "Ninja Blade"?
<TheRainbowDash> (music)
<Ninjazz> Sure you can. :)
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: What about Ninja Guiden?
<Capn_Gavn> jazz blade?
<flutter_spin> or Ninja Star. I could do that.
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Not sure which clan i would want to be, but Ryu is too OP to be part of my clan of weak ponies.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh...
<Ninjazz> Ninja Star... Sound good.
<kenne> well im gunna kind of fade out here
<Ninjazz> Infactr Ninja Star
<flutter_spin> Yea, you can be brother of Death Star's OC Night Star
<flutter_spin> I put him in "Moon Time"
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi chat
<Ninjazz> Wow... That sound pretty cool. I can be DeathStar's brother?
<Woodenfan> o hai sumica
<Ninjazz> Hey Sumi!
<flutter_spin> lol
<Woodenfan> AFTER NEARLY 24 HOURS, NEARLY ALL OF MY TORRENTS ARE DONE
<flutter_spin> where have you been Sumi?
<Woodenfan> Ugh, Secret of my excess, I love that episode, JUST. DOWNLOAD. ALREADY.
<Capn_Gavn> pshh, took me 3 days straight to dl AvP game
<Sumica> 00,10freaking nightmare about bugs and a filty restraunt.
<Capn_Gavn> from steam
*Sumica shudders
<flutter_spin> we killed a rat in our restraunt
<eXAKR> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 10 minutes
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Sumica! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<Ninjazz> o_o
<Woodenfan> I couldn't sleep for a while cuz of Hurricane Fluttershy. I nearly cried myself to sleep.
<Ninjazz> I hate bugs.
<Lil_B> what a story sumica
<Darky> !eXAKR
<eXAKR> I killed the script
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: They are ok, just that spiders are the ones that make me cringe. They creep me the fuck out.
<Ninjazz> One of the bad sides to having dreams, eh?
<Capn_Gavn> i only have bugs when they dont let me sleep in the summer
<Capn_Gavn> hate
<eXAKR> !attack drfsupercenter Discord ChocolateRain
<ScriptBot> Discord uses ChocolateRain on drfsupercenter! It's a critical hit! drfsupercenter has 8 HP left!
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: You and me both, Dashie. *Shudders*
<Sumica> 00,10I tend to wake up right away from nightmares vut still the image is there
<TheRainbowDash> *shudders as well*
<Lil_B> I hate bugs too, i guess thats why i don't mind spiders
<Ninjazz> Image of what?... How bad was it?
<Woodenfan> waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
<Sumica> 00,10nice long coat wrek
<eXAKR> !attack drfsupercenter Espeon flop

<flutter_spin> So anyone stay up for Toonami?
<eXAKR> How?
<eXAKR> !attack drfsupercenter No-one nothing
<ScriptBot> No-one uses nothing on drfsupercenter! drfsupercenter has 88 HP left!
<Espeon> I think that's enough of that script for now.
<Sumica> 00,10Shame dusters are so over heavy to ship I got one you would probably look good in
<Lil_B> I think i finally found out why I'm most productive during the night. I think I need some kind of deadline to do work
<eXAKR> OK.
<Ninjazz> I don't get Toonami till a week after it airs in the US.
<TheRainbowDash> Lil_B: What if there was no deadline for something?
<Woodenfan> I saw Toonami last night. It was pretty bad. :s
<flutter_spin> aw
<Lil_B> TheRainbowDash Then it will take a LOONG wime untill it's done
<Ninjazz> Not a good sign...
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: I got Toonami here in Batlimare, but didn't watch it. I didn't feel like it at that time, and still don't today.
<flutter_spin> I think a deadline makes me more nervous. I tend to be productive if I have a cheerleading squad
<Lil_B> what is Toonami?
<OctaviaChaser> Someone ping me when they are choosing the peeps for L4D2 please.
<eXAKR> !breeface
<TheRainbowDash> Lil_B: Some sort of anime show that everypony freaks out about.
<eXAKR> Ohai
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Anime in the US should embraced. The better it gets here, the more anime we can enjoy here.
<flutter_spin> Lil_B: its a show that used to air on Cartoon Network like 6 years ago. It came back on Adult Swim
<Woodenfan> Here's a tip for you, Toonami: Just making shows that normally occupy that block is pretty lazy. BLEACH SHOULDN'T BE ON TOONAMI, DAMMIT
<Lil_B> I have L4D2, but I don't know how good I am
<Ninjazz> Agreed.
<eXAKR> I guess drfsupercenter is whining about me to Ascendant right now
<Woodenfan> btw, Bleach's animation sucks ass. I used to REALLY like it, but now it's so...STUDIO PIERROT, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
<flutter_spin> But it had Ghost in the Shell. That had to count, right?
<Espeon> It doesn't even matter who you're targetting, you're spamming and basically desperately waving your hands fishing for a reaction
<Darky> Could you stop that please? EXAKR?
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Oh right. Over here, we just don't really accept ideas from other countries, because we got our own cartoons and such. To me, anime is fine, just that i am not so into it.
<Espeon> you're lucky you're not ding dong bannu already
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't know... I need to wait for a bit to reach here.
<Lil_B> TheRainbowDash where do you live?
<TheRainbowDash> Lil_B: Baltimare.
<Sumica> 00,10all they did was rebrand saterday [AS]
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Maybe...
<Lil_B> TheRainbowDash I meant the country XD, but its the US right?
<Woodenfan> I know Sumica, that's why I didn't watch it.
<TheRainbowDash> Lil_B: Yeah, it is...:D
<Ninjazz> Well, that sucks, Sumi. I was hoping for a legit return.
<flutter_spin> besides, you can still go to the other streaming site of Toonami Aftermath
<Ascendant> <censored> bastard
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have sworn 27 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
<Ascendant> I was going to ban him earlier
<Sumica> 00,10then again anime block [AS] was just a rebranded Toonami midnight run
<Ascendant> But thought to wait a while
<flutter_spin> agreed Sumi.
<Ninjazz> -__-
<Woodenfan> eeyeah
<Ninjazz> Not happy about that...
<Ascendant> I'm tired of him
<Ninjazz> Whatever. I'll watch it and make up my mind about that.
<Espeon> See I'm not particularly one that agrees with drf often but
<flutter_spin> I shall forever remember Midnight Run that introduced me to music videos like Daft Punk and Gorillaz
<Lil_B> I think Europe got into Anime a little it earlier because it didn't had so much own animations like the US
<Espeon> jesus christ what is exakr thinking =s
<Ninjazz> Just... My hopes have been lowered a bit.
<Ascendant> This has been going on for too long
<Espeon> oh well
<Ascendant> I've warned eXAKR probably 5 times AT LEAST up to date
<Woodenfan> yeah sorry Ninjazz. Not as good as it was.
<Ascendant> via PM and serious talks
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis is best Alicorn http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4nyxgotRg1rvwsino2_1280.png
*Ninjazz sighs
<Ascendant> he's "apologised" but never really listened
<Ascendant> So
<Ascendant> I'm over this
<Woodenfan> It needs more popular anime at that time block, not just rebranding AS Anime block
<Sumica> 00,10They had some new reviews and had Steve Blum redub over the old Toonami bumps but was basicly the same toonami from what 10 years ago.
<Ascendant> And if he tries to dispute it and complain, which he will, I have so much evidence against him
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix that picture is awesome
<Ascendant> And I know a lot of other people in here will agree with me
<Woodenfan> Ok, how'd Chrysalis become what she did? With the holes n such?
<Ninjazz> Fanon.
<Woodenfan> Sumica: I thought those clips looked familiar. LAZINESS
<CrimsonPhoenix> Woodenfan that's purely fanon
<Woodenfan> ah ok
<Sumica> 00,10I should stream Interstella 5555 again
<Ninjazz> I'll just watch the damn show... Hopefully some shows will be worth it.
<Ninjazz> Yes, you should, Sumi.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it's from a chrysal-YES SUMICA
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, cool Sumi, that sounds great to me.
<Ninjazz> I can already hear the Daft Punk coming to my ears.
<Lil_B> Is that the Anime with Daft Punk music?
<TheRainbowDash> ....oh, did anyone hear that the annoying orange is coming to cartoon network?
*Twi_Fi is back.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B: It's better to say Virtual Album
<TheRainbowDash> Daft punk music and anime go so well together.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Visual**
<Woodenfan> TheRainbowDash: I thought it'd be coming to Nickelodeon. Well, I'm not watching it either way.
<Sumica> 00,10Fun fact, Interstella 5555 is the first thing I ever stremed here
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god
<Ninjazz> And that instantly made you awesome.
<flutter_spin> ugh. Reminds me of *draws a blank* that Freaky Fred guy on Nick
<Wrek> 05still got a long way untill my leather coats are perfect
<TheRainbowDash> Woodenfan: Yeah, it is on Cartoon Netowrk. Not really interested either. I just want popular Youtbers to stay on the internet, and not expand into cartoon series and such.
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> exfail
<Woodenfan> eeeeeeeeyegh, WHY TV WHY? First Fred, now this, why can't they accept that WE DON'T WANT IT ON TV
<Sumica> 00,10cute twi
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder why he came back from hiding anyway
<Ninjazz> Dem Coats
<Woodenfan> A good 98% of the Fred movie was him screaming.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's why I do not watch TV anymore
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can find everything I want in the net
<TheRainbowDash> Woodenfan: Involved money, it will always backfire on us, the viewers and the consumers.
<flutter_spin> then they had a special with him in iCarly
<flutter_spin> yeeesh
<Woodenfan> yeeeeeeeeeeeeah :(
<Woodenfan> I'm glad Freddie said he didn't like Fred. I think having a sense of opinion is a good thing.
<CCCP> hello
<Sumica> 00,10You know who has an awsome leather jacket, Dickshep
<Ninjazz> ^
<Twi_Fi> Hello CCCP
<TheRainbowDash> Hello CCCP! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<Ninjazz> Hey CCCP!
<Woodenfan> Then they said they'd do mean things to him unless he liked fred. BULL. SHIT.
<CCCP> hai Twi_Fi TheRainbowDash and Ninjazz
<TheRainbowDash> Woodenfan: Wait, what things?
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: im good you?
<flutter_spin> lol my fic is still in queue. I put it up my 8pm last night. It still has like 15 in queue.
<Ninjazz> First time I saw that jacket, Sumi, I was like "Holy crap... Is that really his normal clothing?"
<Wrek> 05whats the name for the sown part of a piece of clothing
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: Ah, doing good myself. Getting myself prepped for writing a new story for my god friend here, Kipkat07_Mare. Need to stretch my hooves more, though.
<Ninjazz> Good*
<flutter_spin> *shrugs* stitched part?
<ImOkayWithThis> seam?
<TheRainbowDash> A button?
<Wrek> 05stitching?
<Lil_B> oh hai thar CCCP
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: oh :)
<Ninjazz> seam maybe
<CCCP> hai Lil_B :)
<Sumica> 00,10So yeah back on Toonami. I guess I have just become too cynical and I just got the feeling they saw the reaction to the april first thing and saw it as a great way to bump rateings for the saterday anime block for the new shows they bought.........witch I might add sucked
<Woodenfan> yeah, a lot of those new shows are crap
<Twi_Fi> Oh cynicalsumica.
<TheRainbowDash> Ah, Sumi, that april fools things, that really ticked off some people.
<Woodenfan> I think the room for april 1st was a better idea.
<flutter_spin> There were just so many awesome shows on Toonami. It was crazy.
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: He is Sumical now.
<Sumica> 00,10zoom in on the part wrek
<CCCP> they should replace all crappy shows on tv with FIM
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: A pony takeover of television and corparate standards? I want all in.
<Ninjazz> They really handled that April Fool's thing pretty badly huh?
<Sumica> 00,10that ginda goes back to the same reasion we dont show ponies all the time here CCCP
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: ikr!
<Ninjazz> I take my ponies in moderation.
<Woodenfan> true Sumica, there's only 52 episodes now, and torrents are easy to come by
<Ninjazz> Too much makes me jaded.
<Lil_B> I will be out of the chat for a bit, I have an idea for a picture Xd
<CCCP> Sumica: it only replaces crappy horrible shows
<flutter_spin> Just as long as they don't start airing Starcraft esports or the like
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, alright then Lil_B, see you later!
<Ninjazz> cya Lil_B.
<Twi_Fi> Cya Lil_B
<CCCP> bye Lil_B
<Sumica> 00,10Speaking of torrents. just got danVs
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, this kind of sounds this the Tetris theme a little, right?
<Twi_Fi> Yay, you don't want to burn out on ponies.
<Ninjazz> :O
<flutter_spin> woot Sumi
<Twi_Fi> *Yeah
<TheRainbowDash> Sumica: You just won the game.
<Ninjazz> Are you going... To you know?... Stream it?!
<flutter_spin> I watched the rest of the first season. It was awesome
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as two eps of lyoko was startng to cause rage last week
<Woodenfan> I'm really watching the Hub for MLP, that Aquabats thing I saw yesterday is INSANE.
<Baka-Neku> http://baka-neku.deviantart.com/#/d51bc7l made some changes to it, Sweet Songs eye is corrected, gave her bonbons eye color insted of lyra and made lyara's arms shorter
<flutter_spin> lol. Lyoko was... Lyoko. It was fun to kill time
<TheRainbowDash> Woodenfan: Ah, I saw that too, but at least Aquabats is fun to watch.
<Woodenfan> Yeah, I didn't like Code Lyoko growing up, and I don't like it now. Avatar, the last Airbender, on the other hand, was great. Keep that up.
<flutter_spin> But if you want to "watch" something, that works
<Twi_Fi> Baka-Neku: Very nice!
<Baka-Neku> Twi_Fi: i thank you
<Ninjazz> Still D'aaaaaaaaaaw, Baka-Neku. :)

<TheRandomkid321> TheRainbowDash I couldnt find any games online today
<Woodenfan> eh
<Ninjazz> It's a french anime that aired a while back.
<TheRandomkid321> I HATE code lyoko.
<TheRandomkid321> Used to love it.
<TheRandomkid321> But I dont even call it anime
<Ninjazz> I found it to be pretty good.
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony!! :)
<TheRainbowDash> TheRandomkid321: Oh well, that game is 4 years old anyway, and of the least noted Call of Duty game in the franchise.
<TheRandomkid321> Anime is Japanese

<HyperMetalLugia> but the battery hasnb't changed other than
<Ascendant> and I can't change screen brightness
<Meanwhile> We need to get bronystate on one of SLAG Gaming's gamemode madness servers.
<Meanwhile> That'd be rockin.
*CCCP then type what you want
*Deleted_dreams huggles CCCP
<Ascendant> Well, the onboard graphics driver sucks
<CCCP> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> a really useful battery bar in the menu
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<HyperMetalLugia> What type?
<Ascendant> and fglrx is such a pain
<Ascendant> intel radeon
<HyperMetalLugia> Intel HD 2000 works perfectly for me
<Ascendant> it's not the graphics card's problem
<HyperMetalLugia> on no ati :c
<Ascendant> it's the bloody sandybridge driver
<Ascendant> that linux comes with
<HyperMetalLugia> Linux Mint works pretty well on here <lucky me>
<Ascendant> and fglrx breaks it
<HyperMetalLugia> ew :|
<Meanwhile> Download ALL the models!
<Ascendant> and also lol
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm scared to update XORG and its drivers
<Ascendant> battery
*Ascendant facepalms
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Tiny Twilight is so tiny.
<Ascendant> there's like
<Deleted_dreams> I HAVE 2250 MAILS ON DA
<MadSurge> Wreky :D
<Ascendant> no battery options on linux mint 12
<HyperMetalLugia> the battery life might have gotten a bit better
<HyperMetalLugia> But yeah, 0 options
<HyperMetalLugia> x.x
<Ascendant> and mint 12 is hardly configurable
<Meanwhile> Deleted_dreams: Guess you should clear out your mail more often.
<Ascendant> in general
<Ascendant> it's annoying
<HyperMetalLugia> so turn your screen off! :D
<Ascendant> I want to go back to linux mint 9/10
<Ascendant> where things weren't broken as hell
<FillyFlam> I have close to 10,000.
<Ascendant> ever since mint moved off gnome 2
<Ascendant> things have gotten worse
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe by Mint 15, they'll fix enough things to make it decent again
<Ascendant> well
<Deleted_dreams> Meanwhile: BUT I DUN LIKE JUST CLICKING THROUGH FOR 3 HOURS
<FillyFlam> Because the brony group on dA adds stuff like every .5 seconds.
<Ascendant> cinnamon, MGSE, MATE, etc. are still relatively new
<Ascendant> cinnamon, at least
<Deleted_dreams> FillyFlam: Oh my goodness
<HyperMetalLugia> Never tried MGSE
<HyperMetalLugia> Mate is superstable
<Ascendant> I don't like MGSE
<Ascendant> I haven't really tried Mate
<HyperMetalLugia> But never seemed to be able to customise it
<Ascendant> also my touchpad on here keeps dying
<CCCCP> hmmm
<Ascendant> also for some reason mint has unity on it too
<Ascendant> unity X_X
<Deleted_dreams> The music stopped O_O
<Meanwhile> Laser in...
<HyperMetalLugia> OH NO
<Ascendant> I used it for 5 minutes
<Ascendant> then gave up
<HyperMetalLugia> that happened to me too
<HyperMetalLugia> >.>
<Ascendant> it's horrible
<Mirju132> hi
<HyperMetalLugia> it randomly installed itself on Mint 12
<Ascendant> unity >__________>
<Ascendant> yeah
<Wrek> 05ä*
<Ascendant> cus' ubuntu
<Ascendant> mint is based off ubuntu
<Meanwhile> Läser in...
<HyperMetalLugia> thank goodness Mint 13 doesn't have anything else but cinnamon/mate
<Ascendant> which uses unity
<Ascendant> Ah
<Deleted_dreams> Mirju132: Hello :)
<Ascendant> I like cinnamon
<Ascendant> except for the fact it has like
<Ascendant> 0 configurable options
<HyperMetalLugia> I blame myself because I installed ubuntu repos
<HyperMetalLugia> :c
<Ascendant> and also ships with bloody openssl1.0.0
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, the only configuring I've done is moving stuff around
<Ascendant> instead of openssl0.9.8
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> This music!
<Ascendant> I hate openssl 1.0
<Mirju132> äõöü
<Wrek> 05å
<Om> Lazers?
<Ascendant> I want my 0.9.8
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> å

<Onebrony> Woodenfan, It was pretty good. Yaplaps "rendition" of it made me lagh so bucking hard.
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01well going with LAGNA THE APPLEEDGE
<Chrysalis> still l4d?
<Onebrony> laugh*
<Woodenfan> Onebrony: OH GOD YES. COCK A DOODLE DOO
<Om> Malavolent: Hmm, to be honest. I havent played that many games. I'm one of those situational gamers I guess.
<Meanwhile> L4D2.
<Malavolent> LagnaTheStreamedge: Spoilers :I

<Onebrony> Woodenfan, :D
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01wait
<CrazyCherry> My favorite music in Mlp is BBBFF.
<Saigneur> hi everypony !!!
<Meanwhile> lol Shizuka.
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01where's the stream?
<Jonbun> The full Art of The Dress of S1 is my favorite S1 song..
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01don't tell me it's that behind
<Meanwhile> LagnaTheStreamedge: round 2 of that weird robot wing lady
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01damn it
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01it is : I
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tabitha...is extremely interesting
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/IGWu9.png
<Woodenfan> I think my favorite song in Season 1 is....ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I dunno. I REALLY DON'T LIKE SO MANY WONDERS. FILLY FLUTTERSHY SCARES ME Sorry, it's one of my least faavorite songs of Season 1.
<Saigneur> ok so my fav song actually is love is in bloom :)
<Chrysalis> ahh its not pre-built teams
<Chrysalis> awww
<CrazyCherry> Rebeeru.
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01cursed panamanian internet
<Malavolent> LagnaTheStreamedge: The stream is quite behind, that's why you spoiler :D
<Woodenfan> favorite song in sseason 1...is winter wrap up maybe
<CrazyCherry> Reberru*
<Woodenfan> so would you say that, as a whole, season 2 was better than season 1?
<Onebrony> Woodenfan, Winter wrap was freaking legit sauce....
<Deadeagle> GET YO ASS WHOOPED!
<Onebrony> Full conversion to brony happened when I watched that ep.
<Om> On the bright side its not buf-oh never mind it buffered again.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Art of the dress for me
<CrazyCherry> She's good.
<Chrysalis> dat clone
<Glitch> okay my internet has decided that is a good time to start disconecting
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01restarting stream
<CrimsonPhoenix> Season 2 song is Smile
<Invi> did my chat died or is it just quiet?
<Chrysalis> ouch
<Saigneur> i became a brony at episod 1 ... that's all =D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the full-lottery thing is meh imo, but I was outvoted on it
<Woodenfan> I think Season 2 had more hit-and-miss, but when it hit, it hit HARD. I think it is better than season 1, a hard act to follow in itself
<Chrysalis> least theres a couple hours before the night starts
<Jonbun> Season 2 would be Perfect Stalion I think...
<Chrysalis> least it gives the mods a chance of winning
<Woodenfan> SEASON 3 BETTER TAKE THOSE EXPECTATIONS AND RAPE EM
<CrazyCherry> I think i was a brony before i realised it.
<Glitch> hope it's done trolling me by then
<kirzstryfe> 1,3have you tried a full restart and router reset Trixie?
<RainbowAsh> Woodenfan, in my opinion, the best expisodes of season 2 are better than the best of season 1 and the worst of season 2 are not as bad as those of season 1, but season 1 is better in the middle field.
<Saigneur> i can't imagine season would exist in the future
<CrazyCherry> Discord better come back.
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01and back
<Saigneur> i want to go in this dimension
<Woodenfan> A derpycentric episode would be cool! (A Derp in the Life, A Derp in the Life, EXIST)
<Saigneur> 3
<Saigneur> season 3
<Chrysalis> though im half expecting you there to be "random chance" that means there is always a bronysith/flarechaser on each viewer team
<Invi> lol the autorefresh of my chat died
<Woodenfan> CrazyCherry: John de Lancie was one of those who confirmed season 3. Means something (he IS the voice of Discord)
<Saigneur> discord come back and dj-pon3 defeat him !!!!
<Saigneur> epic HUB time
<Glitch> Can't do right now internet iss being use by my brother
<CrazyCherry> Woodenfan: YIPPI YAI YEI!!!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If Discord returns or at least appears in a flashback episode....awesome.
<Woodenfan> I think they should have an episode with the background characters as the stars for a day (not CMC, they were originally going to be a side series)
<Saigneur> Woodenfan: <3 oh goodness
<Malavolent> Woodenfan: I think he said he will be voicing pony, didn't he?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Can they really have a voice as distinctive as John's and *not* place him as Discord again?
<CrazyCherry> He is Q after all....
<Woodenfan> Who? John de Lancie? I don't know
<TheRainbowDash> Be right back everypony, got to nom for a while.
<Meanwhile> You don't know who John De Lancie is?
<CrazyCherry> Reberru Two action!!
<Meanwhile> Do you live in a cave?
<Meanwhile> Do you eat raw fish?
<Glitch> but for the night event my brother will mysteriously lose his internet connection for about an hour
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
<Meanwhile> Do you sacrifice goats to the sun in the morning?
<Malavolent> Meanwhile: Read that statement again. :D
<Gunthler> Okay then TheRainbowDash see ya later. :3
<Glitch> or more
<CrazyCherry> Meanwhile: In Minecraft yes.
<RainbowAsh> Meanwhile, what does sushi have to do with it?
<Saigneur> i think he don't watch star trek
<Woodenfan> Discord is my favorite villain of the 3, he had a good backstory and actually came CLOSE to taking over Equestria. Chrysalis just trolled with everyone (albeit convincingly)
<Meanwhile> Har de har har. Sushi raw fish joke. Oh my sides.
<Om> I'm gunna make BACON!

<LordCelestia> 0,5Hye, no sub spam
<CK|Ded> See why I say that 2 vs 1 in this sort of gameplay is kind of unfair?
<CK|Ded> XD
<TheRainbowDash> CK|Ded: It does feel unbalanced, yes.
<Malavolent> I don't think so.
<Irish_Pony> I just heared John Cleese say "YOU BASTARD!" and now I have hat coffe spilled on me :P
<Malavolent> They're not that strong if he doesn't stand between them.
<Irish_Pony> *hot
<CK|Ded> Kind of hard to avoid, Malavolent. His hits don't appear to affect the doll-like one.
<Malavolent> CK|Ded: The doll did seem to have some sort of healthbar.
<Meanwhile> Ah great it's the sentient sludgeball.
<CK|Ded> She moves entirely on her own from the looks of it, so it's much too easy to end up in a scenario where he's stuck between them.
<Malavolent> CK|Ded: And when is the doll knocked out, it's over.
<CrazyCherry> DAT COMBO!
<CK|Ded> Dear christ it's like the Blob and a Hollow had a kid

<CK|Ded> Naw, still think Alucard is best Alucard.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Is she sparkling? She's a vampire in the daylight
*Irish_Pony drinks tea
<Saigneur> i suppose there no other french here ... anyway i like trains :)
<TheRainbowDash> OmegaMetroidBrony: She is one of those vampire bros from Twilight.

<Meanwhile> Ragna is all about bitches.
<CK|Ded> Seriously, dat motion.

<Rex_Mundi> Leadhoof- You know, now that I think of it, I cant think of a single Japanee Deity other than Ameterasu.
<MadSurge> Brrrrrrrrrrrrrother.

<TheRainbowDash> CK|Ded: Guess not, it is too powerful.
*Om is distracted
<Midnight_Tempest> there are some attacks that you cant dodge...
<Ponies47> I'm pretty sure my brother would go ape(squee) while playing this.
<CK|Ded> OOF
<CK|Ded> That was going pretty well actually.
<Meanwhile> Never assume these kind of things are going pretty well. You'll slip up and get distortion bombed from here to Timbucktoo.
<Midnight_Tempest> final boss is always a douchebag in these games...
<Irish_Pony> FlareChaser: :|
<CK|Ded> Meanwhile: So, Eva Rule 3?

<Saigneur> my little pony, fighting is magic
<flutter_spin> well its my 'written expression'. Ideas flow through my head and in my sleep and I just spam it all on paper and edit it later

<flutter_spin> Whats the years difference between you, Bronysith and your bro?
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01E.T. wasn't 8-bit though
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01I'm sure the 2600 was less than 8-bit
<MadSurge> Gaming night in 11 minutes?
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: one is 2 years older. and the other is 6 years. matt is 20 and andrew is 24. matt is the one with sugary treats

<Saturn> 08,01better hook up with John de Lancie.
<GilDash> Saturn: I don't think "not talking about it" means what you think it means. :D
<Bronysith> Q?
<cachi01> yes
<Bronysith> or discord
<Bronysith> q or discord
<cachi01> DISCOOOORD
<Bronysith> Saturn x discord
<Irish_Pony> http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/favourites/#/d3jbkgm
<Meanwhile> GilDash: You keep using that :D I do not think it means what you think it means.
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: it's common knowledge that we're trying to get him to the UK convention
<Bronysith> BRB EVERYPONY i have to make a deposit in the national bank of the porcelain
<Bronysith> AKA A SHIT TAKING
<CCCP> hai GilDash
<cachi01> lol
<LagnaTheStreamedge> 09,01Sith, that was uncalled for
<flutter_spin> Its odd that I don't picture John as Q or Discord. I picture him as the voice I hear which reminds me of the personality he portrayed
<Hawkie> kay
<Hawkie> Lighty?
<Hawkie> are you here
<Luna_of_War> The one time I need the wall-of-text chat intro message, it doesn't come up...
<Saturn> 08,01flutter_spin: so, um, Q or Discord?
<Meanwhile> God I want the entirety of mane chat to get hit by a bus right now.
<GilDash> Saturn: Well, as long as it isn't all those "Secret" emails. :D
<flutter_spin> lol. Do I have to choose, Saturn?
<Luna_of_War> flutter_spin: DisQord
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> because ?
<Lighty> Ya
<Meanwhile> Because I'm in a bad mood.
<flutter_spin> I will say that my favorite of all is when Q summoned the mexican band on the bridge. So I say Q
<CrimsonPhoenix> I need to watch Star Trek
<Meanwhile> Yes you do.
<Meanwhile> Star Trek is best pony.
<Meanwhile> http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/images/1310671996285.jpg
<CCCP> lol
<ZetaMetroidBrony> I love some of the music in Chrono Trigger
<flutter_spin> Second would have to be the Peter Pan incident when Picard was Robin Hood and Q said "This woman is very clever. I see why you like her so much"
<Om> Poni is best pony
<flutter_spin> lol Peter Pan.. Robin Hood
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fair enough i guess
<Ponies47> Meanwhile: Never really was a fan of Star Trek
<flutter_spin> My mom just walked in. Got distracted
<Leadhoof> omgomg awwwwwwww

<flutter_spin> You know what? I feel like taking a bubble bath... right now.
<Dan_> Enough talk, have at you!
<Meanwhile> Shed.mov was amusing.
*PartyCannon zips his lips
<cachi01> all the MOVS are good imo

<Litwick> Mandows.MOV OTP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I loved Bacon.mov

<Gunthler> CCCP: PM.
<Meanwhile> Skyrim with a lot more clicking or Torchlight with dragons?
<CCCP> Gunthler: wut?
<flutter_spin> I knew they had money issues, but shutting down wasn't on my mind
<Leadhoof> It was their first game. It was good, but they...well, yeah. Took out too much money on loan thinking they'd sell the 3 million copies they needed to make it back.
<Gunthler> CCCP: PM me if you wanna know.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02$20 is too expensive...but $19.99 is a bargain.
<Starweardo> Michael: How do you do those emote things? like 'hugging'?
<CK|Ded> That's why I get around it by mentally switching the number back to $20.
<VenHur96> Ikr?
<Vivix> I always found 20 to look prettier, so I want to buy that more
<KONY> really who changed my name? :[
<panda> SuperBrony64: XD 1 cent?

<Deadeagle> bronysith: blizzard?
<Om> GilDash: But would I want to?
<Bronysith> Deadeagle: blizzard
<Deadeagle> bronysith: like company or weather?
<Bronysith> company
<CCCP> mfw i spend alot of time to make my on thread on pony chan and it doesn't work
<CCCP> own*
<Bronysith> i like their games. hate their customer support
<Deadeagle> XD heh weather...
<FlareChaser> Blizzard is the best Company :|
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: valve is better
<GilDash> Om: Now, that's debatable. :D
<FlareChaser> I like Blizzards customer support.
<Meanwhile> Looks like kirz took a right pounding there.
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: derp, I forgot about valve :P
<Meanwhile> -if you know what I mean.
<GilDash> Nah, Interplay. :D
<Om> GilDash: I would rather it not be.
<Deadeagle> NOPE. chuck testa
<Magical_pablez94> OWNED
<FlareChaser> Blizzards customer support was never bad for me.
<CCCP> i like nintendo when they make games with mario and zelda
<Deadeagle> chuck testa is best
<Bronysith> i only really trust blizzard and valve nowadays to produce high quality games
<Shamroc> and users win the second game!
<GilDash> Om: In that case, yes, yes you do want to know. ;)
<CCCP> i dont like them when they make games like wii play
<HatsuneMikuFan> I can't wait for the new Supe Smash Bros.
<CCCP> ^
<Bronysith> HatsuneMikuFan: that will come out for the wiiu
<Vordox> HatsuneMikuFan: You mean Sony Allstar?
<Om> GilDash: Damn loopholes -_-
<Shamroc> omg headache!
<CCCP> i didn't think the wii was revolutionary
<Meanwhile> The wii was a step backwards. Off a bridge.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Wrong
<CCCP> it wasn't that bad
<Vordox> Without WII we wouldn't have kinect
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bronysith: I know so I ahve to buy the Wii U only for that and maybe for some ohter games too
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: it was a swan dive into a pool filled with razor blades
<CCCP> it just wasn't that good
<fluttercry> 05,15I got really far across that bridge
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Kinect is a step backwards off a bridge into a ditch.
<Meanwhile> A ditch full of hooker corpses.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: and razors
<HatsuneMikuFan> Vordox: It looks good but I don't have a PS3
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: go get your food we can wait..
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Wrong again, it was a reinsertation
<Vordox> Reinsertion*
<Midnight_Tempest> heh... made you fall off a ledge fluttercry, it was fun
<DuskStarshimmer> I feel like a frikken god. Such a good feeling
*Flutterguy pats fluttercry on the head
<Meanwhile> Vordox: A reinsertion of walking backwards off a bridge.
<Vordox> Meanwhile: You can only advance equipment, if the equipment sells nowadays
<Bronysith> MOTION GAMING CANT WORK
<GilDash> Om: Give me a loophole to play with and it'll be a lot bigger than you thought it could be. ;)
<CCCP> i would be a PC gamer if i had a good PC
<Vordox> Meanwhile: No, its like the powerglove upgrdaded. :P
<Meanwhile> What Bronysith said.
<fluttercry> 05,15That was fun, I would have got to the plane if you hadn't jockyed me
<Meanwhile> Motion controls are a waste of time.
<Vordox> Bronysith: It can, and it will.
<CCCP> Meanwhile: i agree
<Bronysith> Vordox: wrong answer is wrong
<Midnight_Tempest> fluttercry: maybe, you still would've had to deal with the tank though
<Magical_pablez94> Nittany_Discord: yeah... take a break
<Vordox> Bronysith: It will, it can, and it's not far off. Maybe 5-10 years
<Om> GilDash: e_o The implications of what you said disturbs me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're going to.

<icybeauti> Can't wait till new Metalocolypes.
<CCCP> HatsuneMikuFan: it was very fun i'll admit that
<FlareChaser> If I dont get to play...</3
<Om> GilDash: probably banned xD
<Vordox> Bronysith: Human controllers will be an added direction of gaming, and I see alot of uses for it, especially to get into games that does not revolve around certain control diagnostics... So yeah :P
<Meanwhile> Bye Flutterguy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Intermission.
<PartyCannon> dat Rainbow Dash menu
<Bronysith> Vordox: but gaming on the pc with a mouse and keyboard is better than flailing around like an idiot
