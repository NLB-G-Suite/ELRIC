<RobotPinkie> lolol, I'll take that as a compliment, Neponig :P
<prince-trololo> Lawl, I wish I did Luna. XD
<DashWithRainbows> Pokemon Emerald - when you fight champion - god that theme was awesome
<Bufurd> uggg music is like candy, you need to take the RAPPER off of it first
<desertman2> The Saturos battle music is better boss music
<prince-trololo> I feel like jumping through a window.
<RAWRity> bufurd actually there's tons of good Rap out there.
<Combustiblelemons> oh cool.
<prince-trololo> RAWRity: Lulz
<Combustiblelemons> i'm okay with this music.
<Ghosties> 4But it's the leaked version
<sirtophatte> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josw4pxJcsc&feature=feedu
<Thunder_Dash> Awesome video game music? I can do that.
<Thunder_Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZrQialji38
<Sol> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbXVNKtmWnc.jpg for epic boss music
<Bufurd> no, there is tons of good POETRY RAWRity, music does not include rap
<GrimGallop> @Sol Meh, I just like that background music for some reason XD
<Ghosties> 4So you have to go into the .jar files to work it
<Neponig> Yes, you can, Thunder_Dash.
<Dark_Heart> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM8muC_uWUk
<RAWRity> bufurd, then let me rephrase, there's tons of good hip-hop out there,
<Neponig> Anyways, anypony know what song this is?
<RobotPinkie> Also the Jenova boss theme from FF7 is absolutely amazing.
<Thunder_Dash> Why thank you :P
<Bufurd> if im going to dance, ill dance to techno thank you RAWRity
<Natleyn> Thank you Sol
<SuperBrony64> Best final boss music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvY-BCvfR2U
<Thunder_Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVA2z_zbWwA
<RAWRity> bufurd that's fine, but to throw off an entire genre of music is pretty narrow minded.
<Dermathil> what's this PMV?

*Silverscreen 11tosses adorable kittens at Bjornfot!
<RAWRity> bufurd so they may not be able to sing, that doesn't mean they scan't make good music. It's like saying "metal vocalists who growl can't sing, so their music doesn't count"

<DecapKing> this video, it is awesome
<RAWRity> except music is an incredibly broad medium, bufurd, and just because a person is rapping doesn't meen they aren't part of music. Does that mean spoken word isn't music?
<Ziltoid> PISSED BLOOD
<Natleyn> This video.
<Natleyn> xD
<DashWithRainbows> i think Cage is mad
<Sol> Damn, Nick kisses his mom with that mouth

<Bufurd> thats exactly what im saying RAWRity, if you speak it, its not a song i think the same thing for oldies rock songs when they just speak a bunch of crap
<Combustiblelemons> saw it coming
<Ziltoid> KICK
<Dashite> Bear punch is best punch.
<DashWithRainbows> inb4 the next inb4
<Neponig> damn. i must leave the awesome :c
<Darf14> Falcon Punch, hes doing it wrong
<Ziltoid> BITCHES
<Sol> Punching movement is best movement
<Zephirdd> lol bearpunch
<Nittany_Tiger> inb4 bees
<SuperBrony64> …why is he so crazy?
<Ziltoid> NOT THE BEES
<RAWRity> bufurd so...the only thing important song is the vocals? no mention of the intruments? the beat? the tune?
<Darf14> NO NOT THE BEES!!!!
<Flutteryay> OH GOD THE BEEDS
<Flutteryay> NOT THE BEES!
<Sol> NOT THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Thunder_Dash> NOT THE BEESE
<Combustiblelemons> Why does he open his mouth with a cage of bees on his head T_T
<desertman2> How do you post those "0008" squares?
<Darf14> Oh Nicholas Cage, your so craaazy!
<Sol> Nick Cage, never change
<Combustiblelemons> Nick cage does good rage acting.
<SuperBrony64> well that was weird...
<Silverscreen> 11inafter Cage Loosing his shit.
<Sol> Nick Cage, you are SO random
<RAWRity> oh god, this.
<Sol> no
<RAWRity> i love this.

<Zephirdd> PINK
<SuperBrony64> Cupcakes trailer!
<Thunder_Dash> Is this what I think this is?
<Flutteryay> ...damn he's chiseled
<Sol> Cupcakes trailer -___-
<Bufurd> Insturmentals are good RAWRity but if you cant sing then i dont want to listen to you.

<AllisZero> Cupcakes, the trailer?
<SuperBrony64> Yup
<Flutteryay> FUCK CUPCAKES
<Combustiblelemons> Dash and fluttershy's excuses ftw.
<SuperBrony64> :(
<Flutteryay> Jesus fuck, Bronies need to STOP REFERENCING CUPCAKES
<Sol> Oh dear, look at the time >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER
<Flutteryay> it's OLD
<Flutteryay> and it's STUPID and OUT OF CHARACTER
<Bufurd> lol @ all people who have been scarred by cupcakes
<Dark_Heart> if this was an real movie, i would see it
<Flutteryay> I'm not scarred, I just hate it because everypony thinks it's fucking canon
<RAWRity> flutteryay that's kind of what Fanfic is mostly about.
<Zephirdd> Flutteryay: actually, Pinkie is incredibly IN CHARACTER in that fic, except of course for the killing part
<SuperBrony64> I would watch it
<Silverscreen> 11> Wes Craven
<Combustiblelemons> fluttershining!
<Combustiblelemons> :o
<Silverscreen> 11> Stephen Spielburg
<Sol> Higu Pinkie, no thanks
<Darf14> Now Pinkie scares me
<Bufurd> if we are going to talk about cupcakes
<Silverscreen> 11> Ponies
<RAWRity> nobody actually treats it like canon though.
<Zephirdd> but the author makes it in a way that she is incredibly condescent to her character
<Silverscreen> 11HOLY FUCK THAT WOULD BE EPIC!
<Sumica> If I ever get ahold of a time machine i will go back and end who ever came up with this song.
<desertman2> I'd rather see Fluttershining?
<Thunder_Dash> I didn't really think it was scary, but Higurashi + Ponies? ... No thank you
<Darf14> No not the CUPCAKES!!
<Dermathil> each time I hear this song I think of an extremely awesome tribute vid I once saw
<Silverscreen> 11Rainbow Dash!
<Bufurd> Something Broke: The Continuing Tale Of Pinkie Pie and Ponycide by george desroches
<Ziltoid> >I just realised we watched 2 videos in a row with the same song
<RDash> noo Dash!
<RDash> Don't do it!
<Ghosties> 4If Hipster were here, he'd probably kick/ban the person who requested this
<Dark_Heart> RUN RAINBOW< ITS A TAP
<SirSprinkles> 6Probably.
<Flutteryay> I despise grimdark.
<Sol> Where is Hipster anyway?
<Darf14> I KNEW IT!
<Combustiblelemons> It will be made.
<Sumica> Most over used song in all of time and space.
<Nittany_Tiger> The Fluttershining.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not here atm.
<Combustiblelemons> It WILL be made.
<Rainbow_Dash> Thats one movie I dont want to see..
<Sol> Grimdark can be good if done well
<Bjornfot> lol hipster be hipsterin
<Combustiblelemons> there's nothing you can do about it.
<Zephirdd> Sol: like in Cupcakes? :D
<prince-trololo> You cut the video short.
<Dermathil> overused due to the fact that it was awesome and made by clint mansell?
<prince-trololo> :<
<SuperBrony64> Here we go!
<AllisZero> Wtf
<Dermathil> (he makes the ME3 soundtrack btw)

<Darf14> This was shown yesterday
<DecapKing> LETS DO THIS SHIT!@
<Zephirdd> old ponyville
<SuperBrony64> There goes Ponyville
<Sol> Doesn't appeal to me :P I think the guro is too flamboyant
<Dermathil> THIS VID!!!
<Dermathil> OH HECK YEAH
<Dermathil> HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN A WHILE
<Zephirdd> is incredibly similar to new ponyville
<Zephirdd> lol
<Dark_Heart> FOR THE LUNAR REPUBLIC
<Combustiblelemons> gee, they sure had advanced technology in old ponyville
<Flutteryay> Sad is fine. Hell, I'm writing a sad fanfic (well it starts out sad anyway) but grimdark is going too far
<Flutteryay> and I love how y'all are like STOP DISLIKING WHAT I LIKE!!!
<RobotPinkie> LAWL
<AllisZero> Hahahaha
<AllisZero> Dat face
<prince-trololo> Flutteryay: That's me all over. :P

<Combustiblelemons> celestias challenge accepted face
<Bufurd> you see the problem is your reading fanfic
<Natleyn> Can I get a link to this, or do I have to google it too?
<AllisZero> Oh man
<Nittany_Tiger> Luna nukes a city. Celestia blows up a planet.
<prince-trololo> Natleyn: It's called MLP fanfic
<AllisZero> This is fucking epic
<Combustiblelemons> Orbital friendship laser!

<Combustiblelemons> AWWW YEAAAHHHHHH
<Zephirdd> gotcha
<Darf14> Firing the Orbital Friendship Cannon
<AllisZero> Oh man
<Combustiblelemons> the world was destroyed.
<RAWRity> i think there's a place for grimdark, if it's handled well. It's only natural that, while we all love the show, we would be intriuged with taking it to more adult/dark places.
<Combustiblelemons> l;ol
<RDash> XD
<Dark_Heart> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LUNA!!!!!!!
<Darf14> Overkill Much?
<Natleyn> Thanks Prince.
*Zephirdd saves Luna
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<DashWithRainbows> that is the most epic thing i have seen this year
<GrimGallop> No such thing as overkill
<RDash> Celestia blew herself up then?
<Dermathil> good grimdark, FO:E?
<Flutteryay> The problem is when people treat it as canon
<Flutteryay> I'm sick of having Cupcakes shoved in my face
<Sol> This music rustles my jimmies
<prince-trololo> RDash: She's immortal.
<prince-trololo> :P
<Sol> What's it titled?
<prince-trololo> MLP Fanfic
<RDash> :P
<Combustiblelemons> Celestia fixes everything
<Flutteryay> OK, good grimdark might be good but I've only read bad grimdark
<Dermathil> flutteryay, you read Fallout equestria yet?
<prince-trololo> Go look at the video Sol, it should say.

<Ziltoid> amg*
<Natleyn> Shoo be do
<Flutteryay> Dermathil: Not yet but it looks intriguing
<Natleyn> shoo shoo be do
<Zephirdd> seeeeeapony!
<Zephirdd> :d
<Silverscreen> 11I spy a sea pony
<Combustiblelemons> Eurobeat brony will do anything
<Darf14> I have all the Super Ponybeat songs
<Dermathil> flutteryay: good example of good grimdark.
<Dark_Heart> Eeyup
<Natleyn> Same
<Sol> It's a Touhou Sea Pony
<Flutteryay> He ddin't put the SHOO BE DOO parts in there
<prince-trololo> MFW I don't like this kind of music at all. XD
<Dermathil> That thing is almost 40 chapters long.
<Silverscreen> 11I read that Lauren Faust intends to have Sea Ponies in Season 2
<RAWRity> meh, really not interested in all the electronica.
<Dermathil> I read that she intended not
<Natleyn> Silver: WHERE
<Flutteryay> OH WAIT HE DID
<Sol> I read what Derma read
<Darf14> Sea Ponies, oh dear
<desertman2> Silverscreen: Link?
<Zephirdd> I wonder if seaponies can use magic
<RobotPinkie> I wish that were true, Silverscreen, but I know you be trollan.
<Bufurd> this is good background music, not foreground
<Dermathil> Zephirdd: they can't.
<RDash> Silverscreen Oh God, that better be a lie :o
<prince-trololo> Faust intended for them to be in S1.
<Sol> Sea ponies are ponies in the ocean.... that's about it. They're like sea horses.
<Dermathil> Only Flutterponies and unicorns (flutterponies being the butterfly wing ones)
<Flutteryay> I read that she wanted to put them in there but the rest of the staff vetoed it
<Zephirdd> I wonder what would Poseidon think about MLP
<prince-trololo> But there wasn't time/resources or something.
<Dermathil> that don't mean they will be in S2, prince-dari.
<Darf14> Its Lauren Faust if she can make regular ponies cool she can make sea ponies cool
<Zephirdd> as in, Poseidon the greek god
<Flutteryay> I lways thought Flutterponies were the Ten Million Fluttershies across Equestria
<Combustiblelemons> Faust said there'd be no sea ponies in S"
<Combustiblelemons> S2*
<Dermathil> nah, Rarity was turned into a flutterpony temporarily in Sonic Rainboom
<Combustiblelemons> Faust isn't here for S3 remember ^_^
<Darf14> Then the mod just lied to me
<Combustiblelemons> Season 3 is in the balance.
<Dermathil> well, Flutterpony with a unicorn horn (they don't have that)
<Dermathil> OH YES

<Combustiblelemons> shipoopi > bag of weed
<herospirit> I was hoping it was the old bamboo.
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…should try watching My Little Pony while high...
<Bufurd> sarcasm Dermathil, is it a foreign language?
<Dermathil> RAWRity: actually, I've seen that 90% of the Dr who fandom say Tennant was best
<Sol> THE GIRL YOU'LL NEVER GET
<DashWithRainbows> i might do that SuperBrony64
<Darf14> Oops forgot the other n
<DashWithRainbows> would be my 1st time so would make it even better
<RAWRity> dermathil I know, I was referencing the fact that tone of Who fans hate Baker
<Dermathil> though I think they said baker was in the top spots
<SuperBrony64> DashWithRainbow: Will make the show 100s of times better!
<herospirit> mute
<Sol> Family Guy is only good for songs nowadays
<SirSprinkles> 6A BAG OF WEED A BAG OF WEED
<Dermathil> probably because they re-evaluated him in light of Matt Smith
<SirSprinkles> 6...this is like my theme song.
<Darf14> That explains why Pinkie acts like that
<RAWRity> family guy will occasionally get a funny joke by pure chance.
<Bufurd> well now we know what your sprinkles are SirSprinkles
<Natleyn> Sprinkles... o-o
<Sol> Actually, weed is a depressant
<Natleyn> Haah

<AllisZero> The moon is pretty outside.
<Bufurd> good singing RAWRity
<Rainbow_Dash> They told me I could take the midnight train anywhere. SO I TOOK IT TO EQUESTRIA
<SuperBrony64> Why are the trains pulled by Ponies?!
<SuperBrony64> What's the point of the locomotive in the front then
<Sol> >implying the Moon isn't always beautiful
<RAWRity> bufurd you mean that screeching bat that got caught in the recording booth?
<Bufurd> its a childrens show SuperBrony64
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Combustiblelemons> don't question it
<SuperBrony64> …And trains are bad for kids?!
<Combustiblelemons> just roll with it
<DashWithRainbows> there are quite a few mistakes in animation and stuff but kids dont notice it
<Suffuri> ight guys
<Bufurd> you have to keep up the image in their minds, to a kid a train withought an engine would look like nothing
<RAWRity> superbrony64 because they still need the train whistle, ofcourse!
<SuperBrony64> We do
<SuperBrony64> THE MAJORITY OF THE VIEWERS
<SuperBrony64> -_______-
<Combustiblelemons> well that was more done to make the story make more sense
<Sol> ... I don't >:
<SirSprinkles> 6I shall return, it is time for a smoke...
<SuperBrony64> WHY?!
<Combustiblelemons> their priority is the primary audience
<Suffuri> if anyone has steam and would like to win some free shit, join the Brony State steam group, follow my instructions in the comment I made, and then I'll draw tomorrow.
<Combustiblelemons> IE not us.
<Zephirdd> there is no machinery in equestria
<Combustiblelemons> ^
<Zephirdd> :\
<SuperBrony64> It would have made just as much sense, if not more, if the train would work the way it was supposed to!
<Natleyn> Applejack has a truck.
<Luna> 07again?
<Combustiblelemons> there is a fuel crisis in equestria
<DashWithRainbows> super just ask the celestia damn writers/animators
<SuperBrony64> Pinkie Pie gets a jet engine in Season 2
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<SuperBrony64> That's not magic >_<
<Suffuri> yeah Luna
<Suffuri> i do it weekly.
<Suffuri> As it says in my comment and in the group.
<Sol> Train is made of dark matter. Problem solved
<RAWRity> superbrony64 there's just some things you don't question. Its not like this is trying to be high fantasy
<Combustiblelemons> pinkie doesn't get a jet engine in s2... right?
<Combustiblelemons> right?
<SuperBrony64> BUT THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THE PONIES PULL THE TRAIN
<DashWithRainbows> i thought that pic was fan made
<RAWRity> combustiblelemons you never know with her.
<Darf14> No machinery?...*thinks about it*....OBJECTION! In Pinkie's House There's a oven so there is machinery!
<DashWithRainbows> not really
<Combustiblelemons> not really complex machinery
<AllisZero> Only ponies make that song likable to me
<DashWithRainbows> its just heat in a box
<RAWRity> superbrony64 it's just there for a joke man,
<DashWithRainbows> not fucking rocket science
<GrimGallop> Osnap, Under Pressure!
<Sol> It's called suspension of disbelief. If anything, it was done to keep the atmosphere of Ponytechnology in place
<desertman2> Queen!
<Bufurd> equestria is riddled with inconsistencies, for instance pinkie states that she eats hot dogs after saying she is vegitarian
<Combustiblelemons> could be a log burning stove
<SuperBrony64> RAWRity: you win!
<Sol> No need to bust a nut
<desertman2> wat

<Sol> RAWRity, I saw the NC review of it
<Ziltoid> ^
<Darf14> Go ninja go ninja go
<RAWRity> it's pretty fucking strange.
<herospirit> Fun fact: Hallucinations happen because your brain is dying.
<Sol> Dat falsetto
<RAWRity> makes less sense than Rocky Horror
<Combustiblelemons> hallucinations are awesome though D:
<SuperBrony64> Am I the only one who hates Snips and Snails?
<Zephirdd> YES
<DashWithRainbows> aslong as they are scary as fuck
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<Zephirdd> NEW CHAPTER OF A WORLD WITHOUT RAINBOWSD

<Combustiblelemons> only had one as a kid with a terrible fever.
<Zephirdd> and I just noticed it
<RAWRity> you guys know that sound of your ears ringing? That's the sound of cells in your ear dying.
<AllisZero> So I went to TGI fridays today

<DashWithRainbows> get wasted at breakfast
<Natleyn> Allis, so delicious
<Sol> Lol, YT
<RAWRity> I was alright with Snips and Snails, but I was worried they'd be how the show would present Males for a little bit
<SuperBrony64> YES
<Darf14> So by your logic Burgers = Alcohol....*goes to Mcdonalds*
<SuperBrony64> Best Song
<Combustiblelemons> No, you'll make me sleepy!
<AllisZero> Yes, it was an amazing sauce, jesus christ
<Sol> Dem pipes
<DashWithRainbows> sweete belle, Y U NO LET FLUTTERSHY SING THE SONG?!?
<Combustiblelemons> Sweetie belle is the queen of soul
<Natleyn> Yay! Sweetie Belle time
<RAWRity> and yet she still doesn't get her Cutie Mark
<RobotPinkie> Sweetie Belle is amazing
<AllisZero> Darf14: The burger has jack daniels in it
<desertman2> what
<Sol> YES
<RAWRity> DAMN YOU SME
<Natleyn> Yay
<Combustiblelemons> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<herospirit> SuperBrony, how scandalous
<NewDCD> backo
<Combustiblelemons> meh I steer clear of 4chan
<RAWRity> PINKIE PIE, YOU FILTHY FILLY!
<NewDCD> sent the note to max a while ago
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Darf14> *phew* thank gosh
<NewDCD> couldn't log back in though
<AllisZero> Oh god this comic
<AllisZero> WHY DID THIS COMIC JUST MAKE ME LIKE SCOOTALOO
<SuperBrony64> YOU SO LATE ALLISZERO
<RobotPinkie> what comic, AllisZero?
<Combustiblelemons> the music I'm istening to right now somehow fits this pmv.
<SuperBrony64> But I agree
<RAWRity> You can bet there'll be a resurgence of Pony threads in /co/ and /b/ once season 2 starts. If for nothing else than to bitch about it
<SuperBrony64> Scootaloo is awesome
<AllisZero> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/231/b/5/homelessloo_by_gavalanche-d476m8y.png
<NewDCD> gonna check if she replied now
<RobotPinkie> doesn't show up for me :(
<AllisZero> Honestly I never cared much for her
<RAWRity> alliszero because Scoots is a ton of fun?
<GrimGallop> Me neither
<Sol> RARITY XXXX OH WHAT A FILTHY SLUT CLICK THIS LINK http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGx2isMivXs
<SirSprinkles> 6Am back
<AllisZero> First post on EQ, RP
<Darf14> same here, hate it when that happens
<Bufurd> its eqdailies comic, go to eqdaily
<GrimGallop> Neither does SuperBrony's
<desertman2> Hi Octavia
<Bufurd> oh hai Octavia
<RobotPinkie> okay, thanks AllisZero
<AllisZero> A wild Octavia appears
<SuperBrony64> lol Sol, damn she's so smooth
<Octavia> 13I've been here the whle time lol
<Octavia> 13But FF is crapping out on me
<Darf14> Nice try sol, I am not being fooled this time
<RAWRity> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF THIS SONG
<Bjornfot> LOL FIREFOX
<FreezeFrame> Octavia: Use a real IRC client :P
<Octavia> 13Yup, my favorite browser.
<Bjornfot> >2011
<RobotPinkie> and that is adorable, AllisZero
<Bjornfot> >still uses FF
<Octavia> 13And I'd rather just use Mibbit, makes it easier on me.
<Sol> Hate on firefox, but we don't have to deal with ads :3
<Darf14> Firefox is the best
<AllisZero> I knowww
<SirReginald> Any bad song + ponies = notbad.jpg
<RobotPinkie> though I already like Scoota :P
<Combustiblelemons> Chrome ftw.
<Bufurd> its not bad RAWRity, there is singing
<Octavia> 13Ew, Chrome
<Bjornfot> :I
<Sol> Ewwwww
<Natleyn> I don't have to deal with ads either, Sol >.>
<Octavia> 13I only use Chrome is FF is dead
<Bufurd> CROME FOREVER
<RAWRity> bufurd that doesn't make it any less shit.
<Darf14> Could be worse, it could be IE
<Bjornfot> stupid hipsters...
<SirSprinkles> 6I switch between Chrome and FF, because they both have seperate uses.
<Octavia> 13>stupid coders
<RobotPinkie> LAWL
<herospirit> FF is for pimps
<Natleyn> I'm with Sprinkles
<RobotPinkie> >"still uses firefox"
<Combustiblelemons> Chrome incognito mode, what would I do without you.
<RobotPinkie> >"stupid hipsters"
<Bufurd> (╯°□°）╯︵ɐıʌɐʇɔo
<SuperBrony64> Safari is for bosses
<SuperBrony64> YES
<desertman2> FF7 Beta is my favorite
<SirReginald> AAAAAAAW YYEEEAAAHH
<DashWithRainbows> awww yeah!
<SuperBrony64> EQUESTRIA GIRLS!
<RAWRity> >people give a fuck about browsers still
<Bjornfot> Hi Octavia, I'm a Programmer. I use chrome because it's superior by developer standards.
<Sol> Did someone say..... Nigel version?
<DashWithRainbows> CRANK UP DA VOLUME!
<SuperBrony64> BRONY HOLLAH!!
<Natleyn> WE NEED NIGEL
<Combustiblelemons> >acknowledged
<Combustiblelemons> >every brony feels epic
<Sol> j
<herospirit> soooo.... how taboo is a carnivore in Equestria?
<SuperBrony64> Whoever did this dub is a master at PMV LOLOLOL
<AllisZero> Yep
<Octavia> 13Hi Bjornfot, I'm also a programmer and old coder and I use FF because it may be a resource hog. But it's still overall better than Chrome. :D
<Darf14> hmm....dont feel epic
<RAWRity> berospirit probably very
<SirReginald> ololol
<AllisZero> Not even Japan's anime industry gives otaku so much credit as FIM gives bronies
<Bufurd> (╯°□°）╯︵Octavia
<Bjornfot> Octavia, Firefox is nothing without the gajillion addons.
<Bufurd> FLIPPED AGAIN
<Octavia> 13lol
<herospirit> I imagine a carnivore in Equestria is like a cannibal here
<Octavia> 13I only have a few addons
<SirSprinkles> 6I use Chrome when I'm streaming, because it's less of a resource hog. I use FF a lot though.
<SuperBrony64> OH GOD MY EARS!!
<SuperBrony64> THEY'RE BLEEDING
<AllisZero> Chrome is a bigger resource hog from my experience
<Darf14> I have a good amount of add-ons, all security related
<SuperBrony64> SAFARI IS FO BAWSES
<Sol> I only use Chrome for incognito mode
<AllisZero> Sometimes I have 3-4 chrome instances with 200-500 megs each
<Bjornfot> Chrome has greasemonkey built in and everything, no need to have resource-hogging stuff.
<Bufurd> i use chrome because google allready knows everything about me, dont need firecrash to know also
<RAWRity> I think the acknowledgement of bronies was a brilliant move by Hasbro, because they helped make bronies feel appreciated, and much more likely to stick with the show.
<NewDCD> this client doesn't let me cycle channels
<Combustiblelemons> internet explorer is for newfags.
<NewDCD> wat do
<Dark_Heart> sweet
<Octavia> 13lol
<Octavia> :|
<Natleyn> Lets all just band together and rag on the idiots still using IE
<AllisZero> Yeah, now imagine me trying to tell my subjects at work that they shouldn't use IE
<SuperBrony64> NO
<Sol> ^
<desertman2> I like FF7 because it doesn't use as much resources and starts up faster
<SuperBrony64> Let's all band against the Brony Haters who USE IE
<Darf14> IE people are begging to get viruses
<RAWRity> let's just hate on all the Opera users
<herospirit> What's this song called? :0
<Sol> Yes
<Dark_Heart> Firefox all the way
<RAWRity> OHWAIT WHERE ARE THEY?
<Sol> Hate on IE
<Bjornfot> opera is actually very underrated
<Combustiblelemons> firefox is good
<Luna> 07live and learn
<Bufurd> internet explorer's security is like a wall made of swiss cheese
<Dark_Heart> lol
<Octavia> 13Then get luvs!
<Combustiblelemons> opera is the hipsters' browser.
<Natleyn> Opera is nice.
<Sol> Nightly is hipster Firefox
<desertman2> What about obscure browsers?
<herospirit> ....I probably should've been able to guess that, huh, Luna?
<RobotPinkie> I only have adblock and web developer addons, Bjornfot. Do explain how I'm supposed to have that functionality in Chrome without installing two addons.
<SuperBrony64> I feel like we just watched a Season 1 Marathon after watching all these videos -___-
<Luna> 07:)
<Nittany_Tiger> IE: Only good for downloading other browsers.
<Bufurd> I dont even use a browser, I RUN LINUX
<Darf14> One reason IE Security is flawed is that its integrated into the OS
<SirReginald> lol
<Combustiblelemons> Linux HA.
<AllisZero> >NO SIR YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
<Bjornfot> then why are you not using chrome, robotpinkie? it's much faster and reliable
<AllisZero> I DON'T HAVE A MAC ADDRESS, I USE WINDOWS
<RAWRity> I use my own browser I invented when I was 14, called internet exterminator. you've probably never heard of it.
<Darf14> I have Linux as well WE ARE SUPREME!
*Luna is using chromium
<Bjornfot> also, can you edit html directly in firefox?
<Natleyn> Yay Luna!
<Sol> lolllzzz, i uze safari XDD
<Bufurd> no
<Ziltoid> THIS CHAT IS NOW A BROWSER WAR
<desertman2> I don't like the interface of Chrome(ium)
<RAWRity> AND THIS BIKE IS A PIPE BOMB
<Dark_Heart> agreed
<Octavia> 13I dont mind FF being a bit of a resource hog because my higher end computer doesnt even notice it and neither do I.
<Bufurd> i get anywhere i want to go in less than 4 keystrokes
<Bjornfot> Inspect Element is the best browser-thing ever
<SuperBrony64> *set topic to CHROME IS BEST BROWSER EVAH*
<Natleyn> I'd say join #browserwar but there's not much else being discussed here
<Darf14> *adds fuel to the flame war* hehehe
<Octavia> 13lol
<SirReginald> I surf the web with my mind.
<Bufurd> (╯°□°）╯︵ɐıʌɐʇɔo
<Ziltoid> Firefox has best mascot
<Octavia> 13Ghost in The Shell!
<Sol> The only advantage of having IE is that you get to rag on the idiots using Safari
<RobotPinkie> Inspect element doesn't come close to the full functionality of web developer...
<Natleyn> SirReginald: Alphas/GitS much?
<Bjornfot> LOL FAGS
<RAWRity> somebody should create a pony web browser
<Ziltoid> what does chrome have?
<Natleyn> Dang it 'Tavi
<Combustiblelemons> not a fan of this music.
<FreezeFrame> Nope, Safari still beats IE :P
<Bjornfot> NETSCPAE IS OBVIOUSLY BEST BROWSER
<Ziltoid> a dumb circle
<SuperBrony64> I use Safari, because it is made by Apple and Applejacks likes Apples and I like Applejack U KNOOOOOO!!!!
<RAWRity> and it makes EQD your homepage
<SuperBrony64> The more you know!
<FreezeFrame> I USE LYNX
<SirReginald> I'm just that powerful.
<SirReginald> lol
<Bjornfot> REAL MEN USE NETSCAPE
<Dark_Heart> ya LYNX
<Darf14> Firefox > Chrome > Other Browsers >>>>>>>>> IE
<SuperBrony64> Bufurd just exploded!
<SuperBrony64> NOOOOO
<Combustiblelemons> poor IE
<Bufurd> lol
<Octavia> 13WB :D
<Dark_Heart> MORE EPICNESS
<RobotPinkie> Chrome is neat, Bjornfot, but it's not THAT much better than FF yet
<SuperBrony64> Uh oh
<SuperBrony64> Emo song time
<FreezeFrame> In actuality, I use FF and Chrome
<Bufurd> <3 Octavia
<RAWRity> aw fuck I hate this song.
<Sol> But Safari is spawn of the devil
<FreezeFrame> When Chrome has all the stuff I rely on FF for, I may switch over fully
<Sol> IE just sucks
<SuperBrony64> COOOOLDPPLLLAAAAYYYYY
<Bufurd> RAWRity: y u no appreciate good music?
<Octavia> 13...
<SuperBrony64> Y U SO COLD?!
<Combustiblelemons> my dad loves this song :/
<Bjornfot> what doesn't it have, freezeframe?
*Octavia 13likes this song
<RAWRity> bufurd i do, Coldplay ain't it
*Luna likes it too
<Dark_Heart> COLDPLAY ROCKS :D
*SuperBrony64 hates this song
<Combustiblelemons> it plays EVERY TIME i'm in his car.
*Sol does to
<Sol> o
<FreezeFrame> FTP client extension, app tabs
<RobotPinkie> I do love the way Chrome handles tabs, that's srsly cool from a developer perspective.
<Ziltoid> inb4 dari hates everything
<desertman2> It doesn't have menus
*Bufurd begs Octavia to flip RAWRity
<Combustiblelemons> I used to like it, but it got really old, so fast.
*SuperBrony64 tolerates it to an extent though
<FreezeFrame> I use FF 6
<RAWRity> cold play is easily the second most boring band I've ever come across, they're not even bad in a fun way.
<Dark_Heart> SuperBrony64, I'm shocked
<FreezeFrame> You just don't like ballads
<Octavia> 13lol Bufurd ;)
<SuperBrony64> Dark_Heart: Why? YOU DON'T KNOW MEEEEEEE!!!!
<RobotPinkie> Do you work with programming, Bjornfot, or web development?
<Dark_Heart> true
<Octavia> 13You know who I like?
<RAWRity> bufurd MY OPINIONS. LET ME SHOW YOU THEM.
<Bjornfot> both, robotpinkie
<SirReginald> Me?
<Octavia> 13U2! I love how all there stuff is so over-produced....
<Sol> Dark_Heart: Care Bears reference?
<Octavia> 13Bonus if you get the reference.
<SirReginald> Aaw.
*Natleyn grabs #bronystates shoulders
<Darf14> Which programming language do you use bjornfot?
<Natleyn> OPINIONS
<Natleyn> OPINIONS EVERYWHERE
<Octavia> 13Haha
<Octavia> 13>internet
<Bjornfot> whatever is needed, darf14
<Darf14> cool
<AllisZero> I should've been a programmer instead of a systems admin :|
<SuperBrony64> Care BARES, cause they care but only down to stuff that they absolutely need to care about and nothing more
<ReticentSmolder> who's poking me?
<AllisZero> Nobody respects systems admins!
<RobotPinkie> Well, what programming languages do you LIKE to use, Bjornfot?
<FreezeFrame> I mostly prefer punk rock and metal, but I still ike Coldplay
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't? Oo
<Bufurd> (insert xkcd joke here AllisZero )
<SirSprinkles> 6It's usually not client specific... =/
<Bjornfot> Though I prefer to stick to C-family languages.
<AllisZero> Yep...
<SuperBrony64> If Lauren Faust took her magic to Care Bears I wouldn't know what to do with my life...
<Sol> I prefer .... anything
<RAWRity> still, Coldplay's bad, but nowhere near as bad as Coldplay
<GrimGallop> o.o
<Combustiblelemons> you know who I like?
<Darf14> I pretty much prefer C++ since its the only language I know
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay... I'm kind of partial to higher level languages, cuts development time down a lot.
<Combustiblelemons> the prodigy
<Combustiblelemons> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwI3cIcFEcU
<Dark_Heart> more epic music videos, enough to tie the world together
<Natleyn> Rawrity: I see what you did there
<SuperBrony64> Okay, let's do a test and see what it's like
<Combustiblelemons> this one is epic
<NewDCD> it's /cycle #bronystate no?
<Sol> Anypony see ATLA?
<SuperBrony64> CARE BEARS 20% LOVABLE SHARING IS CARING OMG
<RAWRity> but seriously, if I can give coldplay anything, at least they're not Nickelback
<SuperBrony64> Nah, doesn't work out
<Octavia> 13Yes
<Bufurd> wtf british?
<AllisZero> 30 years now?
<FreezeFrame> My Little MythBusters
<Sumica> makes sence, they did one for top gear.
<Combustiblelemons> pony mythbusters?
<AllisZero> Man I remember when it was still 20 years!
<Darf14> that's not the Mythbusters, those are the MythPonies!
<Nittany_Tiger> British voice?
<Bjornfot> RobotPinkie, that completely depends on what I'm doing. I often go "learn" (aka, look up the structure and built in functions) a new language just because I think it might do the job better.
<Combustiblelemons> why is tory not dash?
<NewDCD> yeah
<SuperBrony64> Mythbusters with Ponys, Ponys don't have Myths lol
<WilsonAvenue> Pinkie Pie would be a test dummy...
<Dermathil> OH YES
<Dermathil> YES
<Combustiblelemons> and rarity kari?
<Dermathil> YES
<Dermathil> YES
<NewDCD> still getting "unknown command" at my end
<Sol> YES
<Dark_Heart> DR WHOOVES!!!!! YA
<RAWRity> ALLON SI
<Combustiblelemons> ALLON-SY
<Octavia> 13What are you using?
<Bufurd> what
<Darf14> Fail
<NewDCD> also
<SirReginald> olol
<SuperBrony64> What was that sound from?
<NewDCD> jmIRC (mobile IRC client)
<Natleyn> Doctor Who
<Combustiblelemons> Hate it.
<RAWRity> WE'RE PONIES ON THE MOON
<RobotPinkie> Well, that's a good way of doing it, Bjornfot, as long as you don't have to switch languages too often.
<Natleyn> GO WATCH SOM ALREADY
<NewDCD> here's the note I sent to madmax
<Dermathil> no, not fail, Darf14. The original scene is much more awesome since he does it with a space ship.
<SuperBrony64> WE CARRY OUR HARMONIES!
<Sol> Not sure if guy or girl
<Octavia> 13Ahhh, shoot. I've never used the mobile version of mIRC before. But I would certainly think it would let you cycle the channel.
<SuperBrony64> BUT THERE AIN'T NO LUNAS SO WE SING OUR HAPPY TUNE
<NewDCD> I did not, in fact, receive your previous note. Did it contain any information not included in the current one?
<Combustiblelemons> *continues listening to invaders must die*
<NewDCD> Regarding the banner, we wanted the banner to include the Mane 6 looking at the viewer, as if they were looking at a movie screen, sitting in a movie theater. Pinkie Pie with sweets/popcorn and so on. Basically, "ponies at the movies." for the dimensions, we were thinking of 1024 x 300.
<Luna> 07is there a mirc for ipad too?
<RAWRity> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<Darf14> True, but in this case he sank a boat
<NewDCD> f it's more convenient for you, you could head to our page, [link] and use the IRC chat app we have embedded on the Theater page, we could then discuss this together with the rest of the staff. If you don't want to be recognized by non-staff, then please log into the chat under another name, but please make sure I know it's you beforehand. Otherwise, we can continue communications through this mean.
<Rainbow_Dash> http://miburl.com/Ps5FYA
<Flutteryay> Hmm what song is this?
<Luna> 07ponies on the moon
<NewDCD> this was like 45 minutes ago
<SuperBrony64> What is that line from about the Criminal Scum?
<RAWRity> THEY CARRY A HARPOON
<Octavia> 13Hmm, well, shes probably busy.
<Flutteryay> oh my this is gooooood
<Octavia> 13So may be a while before we hear from her.
<Bjornfot> For example, RobotPinkie, the Dating Sim uses Ren'Py, which is a mark-up language, but also supporting most of Python. I didn't know any of that before. But I looked it up, saw it would be pretty simple to learn and applied for the job.
<Natleyn> Rainbow, I should've been playing oblivion since hours ago
<NewDCD> haven't gotten a reply, hopefully she decides to enter the channel (and becomes a regular...)
<Natleyn> but ponies :(
<NewDCD> indeed
<NewDCD> no rush
<SuperBrony64> 7:34 PM?! PONY TIME!
<NewDCD> that said
<Octavia> 13But the message looks good. Though you didnt mention anything about possible background ponies thrown in if she has the time. :P But oh well. Other than that, it looks good to me.
<NewDCD> we have a lot of regulars now, ja?
<Ziltoid> alright
<Bufurd> i know right Natleyn? need to go play css... but ponies
<Rainbow_Dash> Hm, I know Natleyn
<RAWRity> superbrony64 Y SO WEST COAST
<Combustiblelemons> 3:34 AM? pony time!
<Ziltoid> im going to sleep goodnight everypony
<Darf14> Oblivion, the only way to easily win is not to level up
<NewDCD> that's what I want her to come
<Rainbow_Dash> I should be playing Dead Island, or Fallout 3
<Octavia> 13We're at 51 atm, not too shabby.
<Natleyn> Goodnight, Ziltoid!
<NewDCD> that way you can pitch the idea
<RobotPinkie> Python is a great language, Bjornfot, perfect for scripting
<Bjornfot> It's like my mind was built for mathematics and programming... aka logic.
<SuperBrony64> 7:35 PM?! PONY TIME!
<Luna> 07I like this song
<Octavia> 13If she has the time to join us here, that would be awesome.
<RobotPinkie> Very easy to integrate with C or C++, too
<Combustiblelemons> >is a very good idea I go to sleep now
<NewDCD> if I wrote it into the note, it'd sound too...abrasive

<Sol> This isn't too bad
<SuperBrony64> You mean the Smooze?
<Nittany_Tiger> Sounds like a revolution song.
<Darf14> Ponies vs evil goat lord
<Combustiblelemons> splooge X'D
<RobotPinkie> ohwow
<Bjornfot> LOL DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA
<Sol> Anything is better than that 3.5 and 3.6 shit
<herospirit> Why do you do this. Why do you do this to us
<RobotPinkie> Is this the special prize, Luna? :P
<DragonRage> That bell will... what?
<SuperBrony64> Let's watch Party for One! <--Favorite Episode
<Bufurd> magic bridge is magic
<DragonRage> Not a bell! My only weakness!
<Combustiblelemons> ???
<Combustiblelemons> ????????????????
<Darf14> Bells weaken goats, its magic it needs no explanation!
<RAWRity> you know what you should do to REALLY troll us? Put on "Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure"
<Sol> RAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHH
<AllisZero> Yeah... Smooze
<Combustiblelemons> No more please!
<Nittany_Tiger> Why didn't I take that bell down?
<Sol> Ohai Spike

<AllisZero> Why did Splooge come out?
<SuperBrony64> Oh no, don't give her any ideas RAWRity
<Zephirdd> lol "hathers gonna hate"
<Sol> Is that Lil from Rudgrats?
<Zephirdd> haters*
<Nittany_Tiger> WTF?
<Darf14> As long its not 3.5 then I dont give a dam
<Nittany_Tiger> Is this shit?
<RobotPinkie> I am cracking up, oh god
<FreezeFrame> >mfw this video has no sound in the right channel
*Bufurd agrees with Nittany_Tiger
<Nittany_Tiger> Hail.
<RAWRity> superbrony64 at least I only requested a short one, not something like "The Princess Promenade"
<DragonRage> Damn wizard unicorns.
<Sol> 3.6 is worse than 3.5
<DragonRage> They think they're so clever.
<Nittany_Tiger> Make baseball-sized hail!
<herospirit> G4>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Everything Else>G3.5>G3.6
<Zephirdd> >mfw I thought my headphones were fucked up instead of the vid
<RobotPinkie> It has very little sound on the right channel, but there is SOME :P
<Darf14> Never heard or saw 3.6, I must watch it FOR SCIENCE!!
<RAWRity> proto-PMVs?
<Dash_With_Rainbows> seriously....
<Dash_With_Rainbows> can we go back to g4
<Sol> Herospirit speaks truth. Effective
<Dash_With_Rainbows> sea ponies suck so bad...
<RobotPinkie> This song is FANTASTIC, but not a good version
<Combustiblelemons> G4 > ----------- Everything else--------->a spiders web--- >G3.5 and all other generations
<Zephirdd> seaponies?!
<RAWRity> darf14 if I'm thinkign 3.6 is what it is, then it's BABY ponies, lazily made in flash
<FreezeFrame> G1 was pretty awesome
<Sol> RAWRity, you're pretty much right
<Bufurd> i dont care what you all think, this is not the ponies i want to see
<Flutteryay> What happened to G2?
<Flutteryay> N
<FreezeFrame> It wasn't G4, but it had Tirac
<Flutteryay> ot that
<Flutteryay> im
<Flutteryay> in
<herospirit> RAWRity is correct
<Flutteryay> teres
<Flutteryay> ted
<Flutteryay> in
<Flutteryay> any
<Flutteryay> thi
<Flutteryay> ng b
<Flutteryay> ut
<Flutteryay> F
<Flutteryay> i
<Flutteryay> M
<FreezeFrame> G2 had no games.
<FreezeFrame> er, shows
<Combustiblelemons> G2 was so bad it dissappeared?
<Sol> Dear sweet God
<FreezeFrame> MLP and MLP Tales were both based on the G1 toys
<RAWRity> Now I WILL give G1 credit. It did usually have plots in it
<Sol> Flutteryay, why?
<RobotPinkie> Putting on some Lovin' Spoonful instead, because they were awesome :P
<AllisZero> ;_;
<Bufurd> is she rideing pinkie pie?
<Flutteryay> I hate how Colloquy glitches on me
<FreezeFrame> G2 toys never got a show, then G3 hit
<Bjornfot> oh god mlp tales D:
<AllisZero> You know what I'm listening to?
<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFlXzGH2vA
<AllisZero> MY CHILDHOOD
<SuperBrony64> So that blonde girl…she supposed to be a humanized version of Applejack?
<Combustiblelemons> Pinkie was originally going to have wings
<RAWRity> G1 was still kind of sickening at times, but it's infinitely better than 3.5
<AllisZero> WHAT HAPPENED TO IT
<FreezeFrame> No, that's Megan
<DragonRage> That blond girl is Megan.
<DragonRage> She'd like to be Applejack, though.
<Combustiblelemons> but faust said "fuck that" and so she's an earth pony now
<DragonRage> Applejack is awesome.
<FreezeFrame> But she was a farm girl.... hmmmm
<herospirit> That blond girl is Bacon.
<Zephirdd> wait
<RAWRity> Pinkie was originally called "Surprise" and was a white, blond pegasus
<RobotPinkie> If you believe in magic, come along with me...
<Sol> Pinkie was originally Lauren's interpretation of what Surprise was, with a Surprise skin
<Zephirdd> why is it G3.5, G3.6 and nopony is talking about G3?
<herospirit> BACON AND APPLEJACK!
<Turtaguin> OH GOD NO!
<Combustiblelemons> IT'S BACON AND APPLEJACKS
<Zephirdd> idk anything about non FiM
<AllisZero> Wow
<Bufurd> weee!
<Combustiblelemons> DELICIOUS
<Dermathil> SHOOBEDOO SHOOB SHOBEDOO CLIP
<FreezeFrame> G3 wasn't so horrible it causes nightmares
<Darf14> dang, cant find 3.6
<AllisZero> What the
<RAWRity> G3 was crap, but not quite as much crap
<Sol> Gen 3 was eh I guess
<Nittany_Tiger> Seamen ponies.
<AllisZero> THERE'S A GIANT OYSTER IN MY RIVER
<Zephirdd> fail AJ :\
<Zephirdd> hop skip jump
<Nittany_Tiger> River is a sea?
<FreezeFrame> This AJ was a clutz
<RobotPinkie> LAWL
<Zephirdd> SHOO BE DOO
<Zephirdd> so THERE is where it comes from
<Zephirdd> lmao
<FreezeFrame> Hence the song Silly Pony
<Sol> This song isn't that bad
<herospirit> That AJ was a silly pony
<Combustiblelemons> they're both like "what the fuck is going on"
<DragonRage> Ohai Youtube Comments.
<Flutteryay> Scooootaloo, scoot scootaloo!
<RobotPinkie> Epic G1 ending to the night, Luna :P
<Luna> 07so guys is'nt this awesome?
<Luna> 07so much nostalgia
<Dermathil> >yfw the broken bridge in part 2 of the FiM pilot could've had a similar segment if the team wanted to
<RobotPinkie> It is!
<Luna> 07I love it
<herospirit> Who's a silly pony, Who's a silly Pony, who is you is Applejack!
<RAWRity> It really is kind of surreal looking at G4 ponies compared to their G3 (or in AJ's case, G1) incarnations
<Zephirdd> I never watched MLP other than G4
<Sol> Easily one of the better G1 songs I've heard
<DragonRage> These two have no fucking idea what's going on.
*RobotPinkie dances with Luna
<Combustiblelemons> some things are best left in the past luna.
<Zephirdd> so no, no nostalgia
<DragonRage> You can see it in their faces.
<Luna> 07and there's more to come
<Darf14> Sorry, no Nostalgia vibe from me, maybe because I was born in the late 80's
<Luna> 07*trollface*
<Bufurd> the only face i have is a confused one
<herospirit> BACON AND APPLEJACK
<Bufurd> ...
<Combustiblelemons> luna... no. no luna.
<AllisZero> Yeah, I didn't quite watch this as a kid
<RobotPinkie> You can't possibly troll me, Luna :3
<Flutteryay> SHOOOOOOBIE DOO SHOOP SHOOP DA WHOOP!!!
<AllisZero> So no nostalgia for me.
<RAWRity> Luna, Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel adventure better be in there.
<AllisZero> Just WAT
<Bufurd> THESE ARE NOT THE PONIES I WANT
<Sol> Ohai Firefly

<RAWRity> C'mon, this isn't too bad actually. Not GOOD, but far from excruciating.
*herospirit *mutes*
<SuperBrony64> I need something to justify not doing my homework!
<FreezeFrame> G4 RD is G1 Firefly's brain in G3 RD's body
*herospirit plays timewarp
<Darf14> Oh great the torture playlist, if it was a 3.5 playlist then it will be torture Russian Style!
<DragonRage> FreezeFrame, have you seen G3 RD's body?
<Bufurd> yes, RAWRity, not bad, but we could be waching GOOD
<Bjornfot> RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
<DragonRage> That ain't our Dashie.

<Darf14> this is so silly that its awesome!
<DragonRage> That hobo is a walking plague.
<Sol> I want the hobos around my house to go away >:
<Flutteryay> Sol, PM
<SuperBrony64> CAPITAL IDEA!
<VioletVanilla> 6,0This all sounds so good. . . Hope she can come here.
<SuperBrony64> A punk zebra?
<DragonRage> ... that Zebra.
<DragonRage> What the hell>?
<Sol> Hang on, let me fire up IRC
<desertman2> This is actually the first time I've seen G1 stuff
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Instead of falling asleep and staying asleep, I woke up again. . .
<Bufurd> that a cloud god?
<Bjornfot> zecoras ancestor
<RAWRity> so, G4 ponies fight dragons and hydras. G1 fight clouds and zebramen?
<Zephirdd> is that
<VioletVanilla> 6,0And suddenly had some tune in my head. . .
<RobotPinkie> HAHA, HOHO, HEEHEE, TO THE FUNNY FARM
<Zephirdd> ...a pokemon?
<Zephirdd> Thundurus I believe?
<FreezeFrame> Tornadus
<DragonRage> A song about eating shadows.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0So, I ran to my double bass and began searching for the tune in my head. ..
<Bufurd> the funny farm song is from MLP?
<SuperBrony64> Tasty…tasty shadows
<AllisZero> A zebra pimp?
<SuperBrony64> I don't see any shadows...
<Zephirdd> they ate them duh
<VioletVanilla> 6,0It came together, and I made an epic search for what on earth it was. ..
<RAWRity> SUDDENLY DUTCH ANGLES
<RobotPinkie> lolno, Bufurd, though it would fit with this :P
<Darf14> Shadow eaters...where have I heard of that before?
<DragonRage> Megan walks so robotically in that scene.
<AllisZero> Seriously, coherence wasn't very important in the 80s was it
<FreezeFrame> Now the left channel is messed up
<SuperBrony64> The most powerful creature in Ponyland?!
<RAWRity> now it's only out of the right channel?
<VioletVanilla> 6,0My tale ended in a surprise as I clicked on a link aaaaannnnndddd. . .
<Zephirdd> Wait
<Zephirdd> PONYLAND?
<SuperBrony64> To hell with the left audio channel
<Sol> Wow, this is cheesy
<DragonRage> Making volcanoes erupt on command? That's actually pretty impress-
<Bjornfot> >ice guy, bathes in lava
<DragonRage> ...
<RobotPinkie> not ONLY right channel, just... mostly
<DragonRage> Rainbow light.
<RAWRity> ...this song's tune reminds me of Saddam Hussein's song in the South Park movie
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I had "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice stuck in my head. .-.
<FreezeFrame> Crystal, I think
<Darf14> Ponyland? So that's why there's humans in there, its not Equestria
<Bufurd> where life is beutiful all the time, and ill be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, they are comming to take me away Haha!
<RAWRity> it think it's diamond guy
<Zephirdd> RAWRity: I think this is the base for the SP song
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Needless to say. . . I now know "Ice Ice Baby" on the double bass.

<AllisZero> So full moon and I are bros
<DragonRage> He's watching me.
<DragonRage> All the time.
<Sumica> still raining here >_<

<Octavia> 13Or maybe someone is friends with Tek, Seth, Phoe or Cereal.
<Luna> 07oh god..
<VioletVanilla> 6,0They must be. . .
<Luna> 07this song
<VioletVanilla> 6,0SENT TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!! DDDD<
<Luna> 07THE SONG
<EmmettBrown> Reminds me of the worthless song from that toaster cartoon
<SuperBrony64> I would like the YouTube playlist
<Luna> 07I cant put that on atm
<Luna> 07doing some administration
<NewDCD> Violet, I'll prepare the Aquarion's TO DA MOOOONAAAAH pawnch
<SuperBrony64> That's fine >_>
<Luna> 07but I can stop broadcasting ;)
<Octavia> 13lol :P
<Octavia> 13Oh, u silly fillies.
<Luna> 07I just think it's a little unfair...
<Spin> Vhose: okay shoot... but not at me
<Octavia> 13I agree Luna.
<DJMidli> thatonepony yes
<DJMidli> i have.
<thatonepony> then you are awesome
<_Fluttershy_> ...I...I don't hold that against anypony, but it did make me uncomfortable...
<Discord> Ungupulate. Should technically be the pony word, but wow, that's an ugly word.
<thatonepony> and on a related note
<DJMidli> oh
<DJMidli> wait
<DJMidli> no
<DJMidli> i played 8
<Octavia> 13Did either The Brony Show or Bronyville contact us to be apart of it at all? I'm guessing not.
<Rectal> Could only find the dog
<thatonepony> someone is hacking the game to make it pony
<RainbowDashWins> It's okay, Discord, hoofpulate didn't sound much better.
<Octavia> 13VV I think it was and I were bitching about it for a while last night too. lol
<thatonepony> so instead of corvus it will be luna
<FourCartridge> What game?
<DJMidli> I only play games not on nintendo consoles ;-;
<thatonepony> and other stuff like that
<Sol> That was my favorite song from Brave Little Toaster~
<thatonepony> more pony themes
<Rectal> MANE6
<Octavia> 13But I cant believe we're supposed to be affiliates with the Brony Show kinda and they wouldn't even mention it to us.
<thatonepony> neat, huh djmidli?
<roushguy> Fluttershy's my favorite
<herospirit> Oh god brave little toaster
<Spin> ...s-sorry Fluttershy..
<thatonepony> ew
<thatonepony> nasty
<DJMidli> whoa
<herospirit> childhood nightmares, successfully loaded
<DJMidli> seriously
<EmmettBrown> It was quite depressing
<thatonepony> yeah dude
<thatonepony> or lady
<DJMidli> someones hacking DQ for ponies.
<DJMidli> thats sweet.
<thatonepony> YEAH and its awesome
<prince-trololo> We didn't even know they had an event coming, so it's not as though we could contact them about it.
<thatonepony> looks as good graphically as the game normally does
<ValtheJean> hello everyone
<prince-trololo> Hey.
<ShadTheCrazed> Theyr
<thatonepony> oddly natural
<ShadTheCrazed> Theyre hacking DQ to post ponies?
<thatonepony> its gonna be odd story wise
<Jigglysaint> hmm
<ValtheJean> sounds like I missed something juicy :P
<DJMidli> Im a dude. http://fav.me/d3cop5u (me on deck)
<Jigglysaint> this might be interesting
<EmmettBrown> I watched it as a kid,combined with Thomas the tank engine. Pt me off tips and scrapyards for life
<roushguy> It has something to do with how she's more or less my temperamental opposite... I'm usually all loud and emotion-charged and stuff
<Jigglysaint> should check back thursday
<MognecioConnor> First time using this site... WHERE DA BRONIES AT
<RainbowDashWins> I feel like reskinning some Freespace ships and writing a campaign about the Solar Empire vs. the New Lunar Republic.
<roushguy> And hardly ever shy and reserved
<Spin> Yo soy un jeffe
<thatonepony> its gonna be about an angel, like a pegasis but with cerain magical ability
<Octavia> 13I mean them contact us, Dari. Since they supposed to be affiliates of ours pretty much.
<SuperBrony64> Yo
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I hope I was not. . . being a bishi ;A;
<Octavia> 13*they're
<Luna> 07MognecioConnor you missed the show :(
<Jigglysaint> most likely they won't be showing the new season
<prince-trololo> I know.
<herospirit> Well, most of us are gone :p
<thatonepony> you can see where it would go from there right djmidli?
<Vhose> The idea so far is for a Pegasus (pegasi?) named Kite, a wannabe failure knight with low self esteem who wants to be a knight (as her Cutie Mark is a shield), but is more prone to being a crash test dummy, and she always wears a suit of clinky rusty heavy armor that makes flying tough.
<Zephirdd> Well
<Zephirdd> now I'm out
<Zephirdd> really
<Zephirdd> but before
<Octavia> 13You're fine VV.
<ValtheJean> oh hey, the main stream is working again
<SuperBrony64> Bronies are the foundation for all your My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic needs.
<Jigglysaint> since it's a channel for preschoolers, not bronies
<prince-trololo> But I was saying it's not as though they could have thought the onus was on us to contact them.
<Luna> 07bye Zephirdd
<ValtheJean> and I'd recognize that wallpaper anywhere :P
<Natleyn> Bye Zephirdd! :<
<Zephirdd> Luna, I do think you should listen to Samuel L Jackson
<Zephirdd> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v6BipcdfJo
<Luna> 07Sweet dreams
<SuperBrony64> So welcome to the herd!
<prince-trololo> As we didn't know they were doing an event.
<Zephirdd> and go the f* to sleep, how can you handle it lol
<SuperBrony64> Later Sephirdd
<Zephirdd> bye bye :D
<Sumica> I sware it's like cox knows I want to see next Saturdays schedule and are refusing to update it.
<thatonepony> hmm
<Jigglysaint> does make me wonder if my friend watches it
*Zephirdd hugs everypony
<thatonepony> kite should get stuck in a tree (no stupid fluttershy jokes)
*Natleyn hugs Zephirdd
<Octavia> 13The what was on us? lol
<_Fluttershy_> I never understood the Solar Empire/Lunar Republic thing...They would never fight against each other...
<Spin> Vhose: sounds like an idea I had except with an Unicorn whose armor kept getting carved up by her horn like a can opener but ya good concept I never design cutie marks for any of mine for soem reason I guess I forget.
<_Fluttershy_> Some ponies just try and put war in everything.
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…how do you do the fancy quit messages when you leave the chat?
<FourCartridge> Sounds nice, but she should get a bone thrown at her every once in a while.
<Octavia> 13I would think they would have invited us perhaps those as guests at least or something, y'know?
<ShadTheCrazed> thatonepony: I see what you did there
<Rainbow_Dash> Going to bed. Bye everyone
<prince-trololo> Night.
<SuperBrony64> Night Rainbow_Dash
<detectiveScootaloo> ...Friendly fire buzzes me heh
<Dee> violence is human nature. they thrive on it
<prince-trololo> Dat...
<prince-trololo> Whatever that noise was.
<NewDCD> Violet: of course you weren't a bishi. I mean, aren't you supposed to be a bishou, anyways?
<prince-trololo> Bloop
<Spin> Dee: ya but not ponies slly
<Spin> 8silly
<thatonepony> shad i wasnt making a joke
<mexican|afk> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<mexican|afk> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps mexican|afk
<Spin> *silly
<SuperBrony64> Probably when someone leaves a chat, the client made that sound.
<Natleyn> Night Rainbow_Dash!
<prince-trololo> You've never heard that before Octavia?
<_Fluttershy_> I know bad things happen but...
<Octavia> 13"onus" Nada.
<Dee> <.< Ponies are Differnt, they resolve issues with kindness
<thatonepony> not stupid fluttershy stupid comment stupid stupid
<prince-trololo> Onus - the responsibility
<thatonepony> i just never got the whole scootaloo chicken and fluttershy tree thing
<SuperBrony64> You seem to be always a second too late at saying goodbye Natleyn >.>
<prince-trololo> Or duty or something
<Sol> inb4 sluts
*Spin begins walking towards thatonepony with a hatchet.
<Octavia> 13New term to me.
<Vhose> Thanks; I was thinking her conflict wouyld mainly be thinking the shield meant she was SUPPOSED to be a Knight, when reality it's more of a symbol for her to protect others in her own way, and she'd have to come to realize this, and get over her rock bottom self esteem at the same time.
<mexican> yeah, ponies love and tolerate the &%(# out of you
<BitZero> Just people being ridiculous, thatonepony.
<Octavia> 13But still. Not even an invite.
<Jigglysaint> scootaloo looks like a chicken
<RainbowDashWins> Well, it's really based on the alternate character interpretation of Celestia. Some think she's a cruel tyrant.
*Dee Glares at Thatonepony
<_Fluttershy_> -lightly annoyed- ...S..so what if I sometimes think it would be nice being a tree?
<VioletVanilla> 6,0hai hai, bishoujo ^^; I just use bishi for fun. . .
<thatonepony> spin i dont need a hatchet
<prince-trololo> It's pronounced owe-nus.
<thatonepony> why would you type lightly annoyed?
<Octavia> 13Like "hey, we're doing this awesome marathon and we thought maybe we could have someone from Brony state as a special guest"
*Luna is confused
<ValtheJean> Bushido?
<SuperBrony64> I wonder what I should do about my hungry problem...
<Natleyn> Well, I am now because Oblivion >.>
<Luna> 07what's going on?
<Leika_In_Sweater> W-what if dogs started to pee on you for feing a tree Fluttershy? D:
<Spin> thatonepony: Its not for you.
<mexican> i love fluttershy´s face right no
<Dark_Heart> I'm back baby
<mexican> w
<ValtheJean> lol don't ask me, I'm completely lost :P
<SuperBrony64> Dark_Heart! You're back!
<_Fluttershy_> B..because it's how I feel.
<Spin> ITS FOR FLUTTERHSY!!
<thatonepony> then why would you bring it to me?
<thatonepony> kinda pointless
<SuperBrony64> Hello again random internet stranger!
<Octavia> 13Just talking about The Brony show Mareathon still. lol
<thatonepony> you want to hurt fluttershy???
<Dark_Heart> WUZ UP!!!!!!
<herospirit> Why am I tired, it's not even 11 here
<Natleyn> Dang that bloop
<Spin> *sigh* Is this guy for real?
<Dee> you can't express emotion on internet easily, you gotta be like the Elcor on here
<thatonepony> hi dee
<Dark_Heart> so what are we watching
<thatonepony> what is this 'glare' you do?
<VioletVanilla> 6,0DCD and I are just speaking Japanese while Octavia and Dari are talking about the Brony Show.
<mexican> !s3
<DerpyBot> I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
<_Fluttershy_> -shies away behind Spin-
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…I should really go grab some nourishment for my hunger...
<mexican> we need muffins
<Vhose> Either way, thanks for the feedback foalks!
<ValtheJean> >mfw I had no idea dari even had a different nick
<Octavia> 13I'm just kinda surprised we didn't even get an invite for someone from here to be a special gurst for the mareathon. Especially considering the "affiliates" thing. Kinda like a slap if you ask me.
<ValtheJean> it just...looked right
<SuperBrony64> But then again, I should also be working...
<prince-dari> prince-dari and prince-trololo are synonymous.
<prince-dari> :P
<Dark_Heart> >_> do it
<Octavia> 13lol
<Jigglysaint> hey will the Hub announce what the title of the s2 episode will be?
<Sol> dis song
<thatonepony> you misspelled thats flutters
<Sol> lol
<HaysforPonies> Return of Harmony I think
<thatonepony> it is 'shys'
<Spin> I am not liking thatonepony right now.
<Sumica> the hell
<thatonepony> what?
<SuperBrony64> Still have Materials HW, Thermodynamics HW, and an Organic Chemistry Quiz all next week :/
<thatonepony> why?
<Spin> Its shies
<Dee> i glare to signifiy anger and annoyance in your general vicinity, lol
<Dark_Heart> lol, this song is da bomb
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what's better is that if you see this show live, they literally have the puppets have sex
<thatonepony> hmm
<Vhose> Nownow, love and tolerate
<thatonepony> that is almost as abrasive as fluttershy
<Luna> 07I knew Val would love this!
<SuperBrony64> Really?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<RainbowDashWins> Yeah, it's definitely "shies" when in reference to a pony.
<MognecioConnor> I seee
<SuperBrony64> I would love to see this show live
<MognecioConnor> Well, i saw some stuff before!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I love musicals, period. The fact that Avenue Q is utterly hillarious is just icing on the cake :P
<SuperBrony64> But I don't live in Manehatten
<Spin> thatonepony: You insult Fluttershy that is almost untolerable
<Dark_Heart> play the video
<_Fluttershy_> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be the cause of all this trouble...
<Ghosties> 4I can understand where Octavia's frustration is coming from. Still, Sprinkles say he and CircuitMane are in contact every other week so I can only imagine that things must be fairly amicable between us and them.
<thatonepony> i dont insult anyone
<thatonepony> fictional or otherwise
<SuperBrony64> The first Broadway musical I ever saw was Mary Poppins and I fell in love with it
<prince-dari> And yet...
<Spin> Its not Fluttershy's fault just this kid is being quite annoying
<Luna> 07Well.. how do we get a banner on the frontpage?
<thatonepony> what?
<thatonepony> who is?
<ValtheJean> well, Octavia's point still stands (as I understand it) why weren't we invited?
<thatonepony> hiya danny man
<Vhose> Charging Orbital Friendship Cannon....
<Spin> thats what I'm talking about
<ValtheJean> you'd think they'd at least mention it to us
<thatonepony> what it?
<NewDCD> we probably can't
<thatonepony> is*
<SuperBrony64> But >$100 a ticket is quite pricey...
<NewDCD> we're an episode stream
*ShadTheCrazed tried to power up the Orbital Friendship Cannon
<Spin> Okay you know what I'm gonna fix this the easy way
<Luna> 07we are far more then that...
<NewDCD> sort of illegal if you think about it
<thatonepony> how?
<DannySwish> hi hi
<Dee> Now the fluttershy fans shall join together to defend her honor as the Great RainbowDash did before us.. lol
<thatonepony> how are ya danny man?
<DannySwish> Great
<Vhose> Through meaningful dialogue?
<SuperBrony64> So hurray for Soundtracks!
<DannySwish> Tired
<prince-dari> They could have invited us to talk or something though.
<thatonepony> cool
<thatonepony> why ya tired?
<NewDCD> EqD would probably NOT want to put our banner at the front page
<DannySwish> nice pony ^
<mexican> brb
<thatonepony> who is?
<DannySwish> U SILLY
<prince-dari> >MFW they put up news items on us which has us on the front page
<thatonepony> aw thanks danny man
<prince-dari> What's the difference?
<Sumica> They still show it in Vegas SuperBrony64
<ValtheJean> from what it sounds like, it seems more like Sprinkles and Circuitmane keep in contact a lot, but in a more "unofficial" way
<DannySwish> My sister screaming in my ears generally is enough to make me tired XD
<thatonepony> i try to be nice to all
<Octavia> 13They may be. But its still interesting they didnt invite BrontState at all. I would think they'd take the opportunity to help us and bring someone on as a guest.
<Fouze> hello
<thatonepony> oh, sorry about the ear pain there man
<SuperBrony64> Avenue Q? Or Mary Poppins?
<DannySwish> lol
<SuperBrony64> Hi Fouze
<Spin> sure.
<DannySwish> yeah, she's horrible.
<DannySwish> Anyway
<Fouze> so whats going on?
<Vhose> lol
<SuperBrony64> You're just in time for Avenue Q Musical Hour
<_Fluttershy_> ...B..But you aren't very nice. you say very v..vindictive things...
<FourCartridge> Ponies could calm her down.
<Fouze> ah
*DannySwish turns to Fluttershy. "What are ya talking about?"
<Dark_Heart> I love avenue Q
<SuperBrony64> Cause that's what Bronies do
<Fouze> so just avenue q?
<RainbowDashWins> It's okay, Fluttershy. The Orbital Friendship Cannon will fix things. It's the only way to be sure.
<ValtheJean> like, maybe they just look at sprinkles as a friend, as opposed to a representative of bronystate
<ValtheJean> I'm probably wrong here
<SuperBrony64> Yeah, you missed movie night and PMV requests
<ValtheJean> but that's just what it seems like to me
<_Fluttershy_> -blushes from her outburst-
<thatonepony> well i searched the word, unlike you, and found it to mean vengeful
<Dee> better crank that cannon to level 11
<Fouze> ok
<thatonepony> which i am not
<Spin> Is it done charging RainbowDashwins?
<Octavia> 13Not sure Val. I'm sure they're aware and all of course.
<Fouze> and i have an idea of a skit to do at an anime con
*DannySwish searched it too :D
<Bpendragon> I have to wonder, I've fired that thing 5 times this week, is there a limit? ;)
<General_Hazard> what's good? what do we got going on here?
<thatonepony> hmm
<Octavia> 13But having someone from BronyState on as a guest would have been cool.
<SuperBrony64> Next week there's going to be a Season 1 marathon before Season 2 premiere
<DannySwish> three finger double tap yaaay go Mac.
<Fouze> trollestia internet is for porn
<thatonepony> my ipod is prolly done chargin
<SuperBrony64> Avenue Q
<ShadTheCrazed> Okay, move everything that doesn't need affected by the Orbital Friendship Cannon away from the blast.
<HaysforPonies> Oh....I get to see cannon fire?
<prince-dari> They've had Sprinkles on before.
<SuperBrony64> That would be cool
*Leika_In_Sweater pokes Fluttershy s cutie mark, out of curiosity >.>
<DannySwish> what's this Orbital Friendship Cannon thing?
<thatonepony> ?
<prince-dari> With his wookie sex mic.
<prince-dari> XD
<RainbowDashWins> The Orbital Friendship Cannon is always charged when there are people ready to love and tolerate the @#$% outta some bronies and pega-sis.
<Spin> Get everypony to the freindout shelters!
<Ghosties> 4Yes, that's right. Sprinkles has been on the show before
<thatonepony> poke a cutie mark?
*HaysforPonies moves a safe distance and sits on a cloud seat, readying his sunglasses.
<prince-dari> Apparently their viewers loved it.
<_Fluttershy_> -turns and looks at Leika curiously-
<ShadTheCrazed> I'm trying to power it up to where it affects it more.
<Fouze> but i would need to find people to do it with
<Octavia> 13Have they? I dont understand why not for the mareathon then.
<prince-dari> And requested him back or something.
<thatonepony> YEAH PEGA-SIS alright
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, that's another thing.
<Leika_In_Sweater> Nothing... I guess it only works with Celestia, like Luna said
<Luna> 07it just feels strange..
<Ghosties> 4*CRAZY THEORIST APPROACH ENGAGE*
<prince-dari> [04:45] <NewDCD> sort of illegal if you think about it
<prince-dari> [04:45] <prince-dari> They could have invited us to talk or something though.
<thatonepony> hmm
<SuperBrony64> You should shoot for the Rainbow Dash costume that's going online haha
<Sol> A movie of this would be badass, but I feel it doesn't need to be a movie (and that it shouldn't be)
<ShadTheCrazed> Gah.
<thatonepony> better hold up my phone
<Fouze> im already planning on crossplaying as trollestia and asking people if they like bananas
<_Fluttershy_> I...Is something wrong with my cutie mark?
<Luna> 07yes exactly
<prince-dari> What about the 'mareathon'
<thatonepony> yes
<prince-dari> That's illegal technically.
<prince-dari> :P
<thatonepony> but never mind that
<ShadTheCrazed> Well, I'll just go to bed.
<Leika_In_Sweater> Nope, nothing dearie
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I agree. . .
<SuperBrony64> That would be quite hilarious
<Ghosties> 4Perhaps...Sprinkles is just a ruse sent by CircuitMane. PERHAPS Sprinkles is actually working for them, and he's a double agent.
<_Fluttershy_> -confused-
<Luna> 07and that is also true
<ValtheJean> lol
<Octavia> 13Well, it kinda is. But I think it would have been find to have someone from BronyState on as a guest none-the-less.
<Spin> Fluttershy=Confluttershy?
<ValtheJean> KILL THE DOUBLE AGENT
*ShadTheCrazed plugs in some headphones and plays some downloaded recording of a soft voice.
<Leika_In_Sweater> I was merely testing to see if you would spout out something random like Celly does
<Fouze> seeing as how at the con matt hill aka soarin will be there
<thatonepony> celly?
<roushguy> Um...
<roushguy> Fluttershy...
<Leika_In_Sweater> Celestia
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow, he makes awesome Flash videos
<VioletVanilla> 6,0O^O
<Octavia> 13lol XD
<prince-dari> SPRINKLEBERG!
<Fouze> matt hill?
<ValtheJean> Sprinkles is Sydney Bristow
<roushguy> What would happen if you flew as fast as Dash does when she pulls off a Sonic Rainboom?
<thatonepony> fluttershy should wear a hat
<VioletVanilla> 6,0<o< SPRINKLEBERG~
<Octavia> 13Sprinklederg...
<_Fluttershy_> Oh...I see...-examines her cutie mark, swishing her tail against it-
*DannySwish whispers something gently into Fluttershy's ear
<thatonepony> that would fix at least two problems
<Octavia> 13*berg
<Ghosties> 4How CONVENIENT that SirSprinkles isn't here right now...
*Octavia 13does the face
<thatonepony> oh my
<thatonepony> if only your sis would do that with you :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, nice sathi
<prince-dari> He must be at the...
<Spin> roushguy: you would power the flux capacitor and travel to the year 2015
<prince-dari> Mareathon!
<thatonepony> as opposed to yellin
<prince-dari> TRAITOR!
<Sol> Why sudden cut?
<Luna> 07I know right?
<prince-dari> BURN THE HEATHEN!
<Luna> 07dat planning :D
*ValtheJean grabs his trident
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<RainbowDashWins> http://www.spreadshirt.com/hate-detected-firing-orbital-friendshi-C3376A7856394/color/2
<_Fluttershy_> -ears twitch and blushes at the whisper-
<SuperBrony64> Nvm, haha, thought you were talking about Skaijo
<SuperBrony64> He was the one who made Friendship is Magic Bitch
<prince-dari> Oh, I'm told that they're likely to switch services soon.
<prince-dari> And they might be having a merger.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this is a pretty good song
*DannySwish giggles, and nuzzles her
<thatonepony> oh no!
<Luna> 07who?
<Fouze> oh
<thatonepony> twitching ears!!!
<Dee> in the year 2027 you get Deus Ex
<thatonepony> what does that mean???
<Vhose> I wonder, does Equestria have a union?
<Ghosties> 4>mfw SirSprinkles actually IS at the "Mareathon"
<Luna> 07Val this album is good
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I was surprised when I heard it at first, because I figured it was just a joke musical
<FourCartridge> What are we firing at again?
<DannySwish> ONLY WITH PINKIE PIE SILLY
<Octavia> 13Lmao
<thatonepony> oh yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh yeah, definitely
<prince-dari> Oh, yeah I didn't specify.
<prince-dari> XD
<DannySwish> lol
<prince-dari> Odysseus.
<thatonepony> what is being fired?
*roushguy patiently waits for Fluttershy to answer.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just I wasn't expecting a song like this in here, which was nice :P
<Natleyn> I keep looking at facebook D:
<SuperBrony64> I thought Avenue Q was just some random skit that was done at a Comic Con
<Discord> A union? I'd assume there'd be, y'know, several, for different industries.
<_Fluttershy_> -shakes her head and looks to Roush- Y...yes?
<NewDCD> so dari
<Fouze> lol
<Fouze> but you arent the only one
<roushguy> What would happen if you flew as fast as Dash does when she pulls off a Sonic Rainboom?
<NewDCD> how many people could this merged IRC server hold?
<Spin> Haya Plorf
*Octavia 13was at the Mareathon during Rocky Horror ... >.>;
<NewDCD> ballpark figure would b cool
<Vhose> Well, I was thinking, the last person to not do their job properly got SENT TO THE MOON.
<thatonepony> you guys ever notice what happens if you say discord many times in a row?
<Spin> roushguy: you would power the flux capacitor and travel to the year 2015
<ValtheJean> HERESY OCTAVIA
*DannySwish is still nuzzling Fluttershy
<Plorf> Hi there
<_Fluttershy_> I...I'm not sure. I've never gone that fast before. I'm not a very good flyer...
*ValtheJean lunges at Octavia with his trident
<RainbowDashWins> I bet the weathercrafters have a union. Who else mandates the hard hats?
<Octavia> 13<3
<Luna> 07Waaaaat
<prince-dari> I'll go chekc for you DCD.
<Discord> Whenever the weather factory goes on strike, though, Celestia just legislates them back to work. And by "legislate," I mean "threaten with moon banishment."
<prince-dari> check*

<TheLotusTeaDragon> I'm guessing size 11.
<prince-dari> 4It's easy to tell when you've pissed off Ghosties
<thatonepony> and it will probably have HORSEHAIR
<thatonepony> so eat at your own risk
<KanyeNorthEast> with ponies
<prince-dari> 4He calls you obtuse. :P
<Spin> all the better

<`BlacklightShining> DannySwish: aren't you gonna help out?
<Lordlyhour> Unless I had a Mcflurry
<Spin> HAHAH I am loving the fanfare
<`BlacklightShining> for science?
<Lordlyhour> They've discontinued to M&M ones though
<Octavia> 13And dida backflip and landed!
*thatonepony plugs in fans FOR SCIENCE AND PROGRESS
*`BlacklightShining yelps! and backs away from Lysiria
<`BlacklightShining> don't…please…
*Dermathil does a mental review of how well his birthday was.
<mexican> bye everypony
*Spin contemplates shoving BlackLight into a vat of chocolate.. for um science.
<Lordlyhour> Actually, it was reading about the fact they;ve discontinued the M&M mcflurry thats made me feel like one
<Spin> bye mexican
<Natleyn> How was your birthday, Dermathil?
<Luna> 07[06:40] <Luna> can he join the room safely? DARI?
<Lordlyhour> an Oreo and Caramel Mcflurry though
<thatonepony> no spin
<thatonepony> not now
<Ghosties> 4And I know how to get under dari's skin
<thatonepony> cant over do it
<`BlacklightShining> (Spin: the L is always lowercase except when you're typing in all caps or saying FreezeLight)
*DannySwish was lulled by Fluttershy. "Whaah Blacklight?"
<prince-dari> I haven't set anything to stop people from joining the room.
<Octavia> 13You are head crab zombie!
<prince-dari> So anyone can join.
<thatonepony> it must harden slowly throughout
<`BlacklightShining> DannySwish: thatonepony is doing science
<Luna> 07ah ok
<thatonepony> which lazyshy isnt helping with
<Sol> Did someone say.... John Madden?
<prince-dari> >implying anyone can ACTUALLY get under my skin
<Spin> Where is fluttershy?
<`BlacklightShining> he wants a pegasus to help dry this chocolate
<Ghosties> 4I have before
<Ghosties> 4And it was glorious
*`BlacklightShining gestures to his entire self, specifically to the chocolate coating.
*VioletVanilla crawls under Dari's skin
<prince-dari> So what do I say when I'm pissed off? :P
<Lordlyhour> I did Quite like the Odd M&M mcflurry occasionally
<_Fluttershy_> I'm still here.
<DragonRage> Ew.
<Spin> < is a pegasus
<Octavia> 13wepon
<Lordlyhour> I am sad that they;re gone
<DragonRage> You guys are gross.

<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Disney Pixar Up - Married Life - Carl & Ellie by Michael Giacchino - The cut from BluRay disc
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, mexican!
<thatonepony> and not helping wingy
<VioletVanilla> 6,0:3
<Ghosties> 4That you'll quit the team
<prince-dari> Hahaha VV.
<Ghosties> 4LOL
<TheLotusTeaDragon> It's always better to get pissed off than to get pissed on.
<Ghosties> 4Dari gets so dramatic sometimes
<prince-dari> Lawl, no, I was serious about that.
<Skyflash> Did someone call for a pegasus? Skyflash, at your service.
<Ghosties> 4I know
<Ghosties> 4That's what makes it better
<Lordlyhour> Why people moon themselves instead of just leaving, I do Not know
<thatonepony> EXCELENT AND more words
*Polarfire steals prince-dari
<Sol> BILLBILL
<Lordlyhour> SKYFLASH!
<prince-dari> Now I know you're trolling Ghosties.
<Dermathil> actually, I think I could describe it as mediocre. Best (and only) gift I got? A handful of subways discount coupons.
<`BlacklightShining> ( XD /now/ we have ponies stepping up…)
<Sol> 8D
<Sol> Pol!
<prince-dari> Because you are the most dramatic person I know. :P
<Lysiria> Why go out in a boring /quit?
<Polarfire> ohai Sol
<Lordlyhour> Fly so fast, you back in time, then buy me an Oreo Mcflurry
<Ghosties> 4No, I'm being serious. I would have laughed if you left
<Bommster> O hai people that don't know me
<Spin> ya
<Lysiria> Why not get sent to the moon via Derpy? x:
<prince-dari> >steal
<Sol> ohai Pol
<prince-dari> >implying I don't want you to take me away :P
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Oh, Happy Birthday, Dermathil. I hope it was a good one.
<thatonepony> fiction wings, you will hover over Blacklight and give constant slow and steady wing flaps while my fans cover the sides
<Spin> Go out in style
<Lordlyhour> Or an M&M one. Not fussy
<thatonepony> SCIENCE is upon us
<Spin> Okie dokie lokie!
<prince-dari> >dramatic
<Lordlyhour> OH GODS NO!
<Skyflash> How about both?
<Sol> LOOK OUT BRO
<Lordlyhour> NOT SCIENCE!
<Lordlyhour> I'm ALLERGIC!
*Polarfire picks up prince-dari and caries him willingly away
<prince-dari> >Ghosties thinks one day people are going to hunt down bronies and beat them all to death
<prince-dari> :P
<thatonepony> uh
<prince-dari> Dramatic.
<Spin> FOR CELESTIA!
<prince-dari> Do ho ho.
<thatonepony> so are ya helpin skyman?
<Lordlyhour> Both sounds great
<Lordlyhour> But they need caramel
<Polarfire> quit the team?
<Ghosties> 4Dramatic, just like how Mexico or some other third world country did to emos and scene kids
<Lordlyhour> Because Caramel is delicious
*Spin hovers over BlacklightShining.
<Ghosties> 4*sips on water*
<Octavia> 13Dat Pony Bebop
<TheLotusTeaDragon> YES!
<prince-dari> See, now you've just proved my point.
<Skyflash> Be back in a...flash!
<Lordlyhour> Not the pony though
<prince-dari> You so dramatic.
<DragonRage> Pony Bebop is best pony.
<mib_99slu0> AWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAA
<thatonepony> uh
<Ghosties> 4I so realistic
<Lysiria> ponyponypony.swf
<Sol> Ponysona plox
*Lordlyhour rolls eyes at pun
<prince-dari> LOLNO
<thatonepony> not sure if getting helped
<Spin> SWAG
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Yes it is! Pony Bebop is the best! :D
<Ghosties> 4You can't change fact, bro
<Lordlyhour> Probably not
<VioletVanilla> 6Luna.
<prince-dari> You're a riot Ghosties.
<Spin> Where you need me?
<thatonepony> and strikes must be made while the chocolate is hot
<Lordlyhour> all you guys'd be doing is blowing all his stuff around
<Ghosties> 4And you're in denial, dari
<Luna> 07Yessems?
<VioletVanilla> 6You have made my morning with this wonderful song/video. <3
<`BlacklightShining> (ponyponyponySWAGponyponyponySW—wait, WTF am I saying…)
*DannySwish nudges Fluttershy lightly, pointing to a baby bird sitting on the ground
<prince-dari> Just a disagreement we had in Skype.
<Octavia> 13A riot of ghosts o.o
<Ghosties> 4But I guess we're two sides of the same coin
<thatonepony> wingaling above Blacklight
<Luna> 07Ohh!
<Polarfire> oh.
<Luna> 07I loved doing it
<prince-dari> School's been pretty good so far.
<Sol> k, night see yas next Saturday
<thatonepony> YES a bird
<prince-dari> How about you? :>
<Ghosties> 4Riot of Ghosts...sounds like a band
*thatonepony snatches bird
<Ghosties> 4A really shitty one at that
<Skyflash> And two McFlurrys, one M&M, one Oreo, extra caramel. The great thing about time travel is a pony can return the second she left!
<prince-dari> Denial?
<thatonepony> this may help with science
<prince-dari> I tell you what Ghosties.
<Polarfire> yeah me too. I like it... but I can't wait to get out.
*Spin tackles the baby bird. "GOTCHA!"
<`BlacklightShining> (this channel is rather busy…maybe we should move to #BucketOfHolding or something?)
<Ghosties> 4Ooooooh
*Lordlyhour celebrates!
<Skyflash> Now who needed some wing power?
<Ghosties> 4He's gonna tell me something
<thatonepony> skyflash, will you assist?
<Octavia> 13Laters Sol!
<Natleyn> YES
<Skyflash> Absolutely.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I have that whole soundtrack and love it so much. . .
<Polarfire> Onward, to college!
<thatonepony> above Blacklight please
<DragonRage> Ghasts are better than ghosts anyways.
*Lordlyhour also grabs the mcflurries and begins eating, forking over the cash he owes
<Spin> Do a test run with the bird?
<thatonepony> and slow steady wingflap
<KanyeNorthEast> oh nicholas cage, you so silly
*Ghosties 4waits with baited breath to hear what dari has to say
<Dermathil> I would try to giggle to lighten up the mood in this drama chat, but I guess the fact that my only gift was a handful of Subways Discount Coupons don't make me in the right mood for that.
<thatonepony> hmm, no, the bird is for later
<prince-dari> I will bet you anything you want, an act, an possession, ANYTHING, that there won't be a day that people hunt down bronies and beat them to death.
<Thunder_Dash> This again? InB4BEES
<thatonepony> ready skyflash?
<Skyflash> You got it.
<Spin> Okie what do I do know
<TheLotusTeaDragon> How many Subway discount coupons, Dermathil?
*DannySwish 's eyes widen, nudging fluttershy a bit harder
<Dermathil> 5
<thatonepony> then LET US BEGIN SCIENCE
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Luna what is this video name?
<prince-dari> I will go out, buy a hat, and eat it if you want me to bet that.
<Ghosties> 4And I'm not saying it's going to happen, now am I?
<thatonepony> fans ON
<Spin> LETS!
<Lordlyhour> SOMEPONY THINK OF THE FOALS!
<Ghosties> 4I never actually said it would
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Lordlyhour's shouting
*_Fluttershy_ looks to the little bird. "Oh dear...it must have fallen from it's nest..." Gets up to pick it up.
<prince-dari> >realistic
<Ghosties> 4I said it's a possibility
<Luna> 07Nicolas cage losing his shit
*thatonepony turns fans on
<prince-dari> >not going to happen
<prince-dari> Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
<Skyflash> Alright, here we go!
<KanyeNorthEast> nicholas cage being nicholas cage
<thatonepony> skyflash, now you flap wings!
<TheLotusTeaDragon> That's only 30 grams of fat!
<mib_99slu0> lol
*Spin flaps with all his might!
<Ghosties> 4Realistic as in that kind of hate happened to emos and scenes
*DannySwish swoons at her kind nature
<mib_99slu0> he's lossing it
<KanyeNorthEast> lord of war is probably the only movie where he isn't batshit crazy
<prince-dari> Well I hope you enjoy college then. :D
<Ghosties> 4I wasn't applying the word to bronies
<thatonepony> yes, yes, i can see it working!
<Octavia> 13And many fucks were given that day.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Lord of War was a great movie. Well, at least I thought so.
<prince-dari> LOL Octavia
*_Fluttershy_ sets it on her back and nestles down again, eyes fluttering.
<Polarfire> I love the Dari vs. Ghosties wars. So if you don't mind me asking, what was the disagreement about?
<The_Creep> One losing their composure is always amusing.
*Lordlyhour finishes his Mcflurries
<Spin> WE NEED THAT BIRD!
*`BlacklightShining tries to stay still as the chocolate around him hardens.
*Spin continues falpping.
<Spin> *flapping
<prince-dari> Ghosties wanted to make it so that only 18+ people could apply for mod.
*VioletVanilla is exploding with giggles
*Lordlyhour aids the Flapping
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Librarians need to do this when patrons won't stop talking.
<Polarfire> oh. :P
<Lordlyhour> THE POWER OF MAGENTA IS AT YOUR COMMAND!
*DerpyBot stands behind Lordlyhour, glowering
<Polarfire> foo.
<KanyeNorthEast> they really ruined wickerman, what were they thinking
<KanyeNorthEast> besides "lets make a shitty remake"
<`BlacklightShining> ( XD )
<Lordlyhour> Derpy, you should help too
<Polarfire> so what about you then? XD
<Lordlyhour> Lazy bot that you are
<thatonepony> yes, do you geel it working Blacklight?
<Polarfire> or existing underage mods?
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Glad I haven't seen Wickerman, then.
<mib_99slu0> wtf
<prince-dari> Well I told him I'd leave if that was passed.
<KanyeNorthEast> the original is so much better
*Skyflash flaps her wings spectacularly.
<`BlacklightShining> “Yeah…”
<Polarfire> ah. I'm guessing he didn't get support from the rest of the team?
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I think I'll see that one instead.
<KanyeNorthEast> not the bees
<Octavia> 13NOT THE BEES!
<prince-dari> We came to a compromise, Val defused the situation.
*Natleyn is quietly laughing
<TheLotusTeaDragon> This video is chock full of subtlety.
<DragonRage> One of these days, somebody's going to choose Wickerman as the A Movie.
<prince-dari> So we never had a vote on 18+ only.
*Spin is flapping as hard as he can but feels the strain building up.
<DragonRage> The B Movie will, naturally, also be Wickerman.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they already tried :P
<thatonepony> hmm, only about 20 more seconds. . .
<Ghosties> 4Indeed, they did
<Ghosties> 4And they had to pick something else
<KanyeNorthEast> you didn't go for it?
<thatonepony> 10 more seconds. . .
<Spin> haha if I took out the 'l'
<Polarfire> ah.
<thatonepony> 5

*Lordlyhour stops
<Polarfire> >defused
<DragonRage> Ooh, multiple choice!
<FourCartridge> See you all, everypony. going to go to sleep.
<prince-dari> XD
*thatonepony turns off fans
*Octavia 13likes The newer Wickerman <3
<DragonRage> ... aww.
*Lordlyhour crashes to the floor
<Polarfire> brain explosion
<Bpendragon> welp go i must
<Octavia> 13Dat Old Spice

<thatonepony> yes, now to chip off the chocolate
<DecapKing> dat win
*Lordlyhour goes back to watching vinyl rock out
<thatonepony> thank you kindly for assistance
<prince-dari> This must be why Caramel wants Big Mac so badly.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> These are like the old theater promos, but with ponies. :D
<Spin> you say chocolate :3
*prince-dari runs awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
<mib_99slu0> lol

<Octavia> 13Haha Dari

<Polarfire> yeah, one thing about school, it forces you back ino a regular sleeping schedule pretty much.
*Spin creeps up to the chocolate covered pony
<thatonepony> wanna help?
<Natleyn> Yay, this
<Polarfire> :(
<thatonepony> hey, take it easy
<Octavia> 13Reach out and touch my *beep!*!
*`BlacklightShining “Can I move now?” he asks. Some of the chocolate around his muzzle breaks off. “Oops…guess I shouldn't talk…”
<thatonepony> this is at this point a careful thing
<prince-dari> Dermathil: Ask Bjornfort, I'm sure he'll know. >_>
*Lysiria turns on a heat fan.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Dermathil> hehehe
<thatonepony> dont wanna hurt Blacklight chipping off chocolate
<Dermathil> makes sense
*Spin attacks the chocolate on the floor.
<Dermathil> I guess...
*Lordlyhour joins Vinyl in rocking out
<Octavia> 13Wut?
<thatonepony> dont get too eager
<Ghosties> 4That's it. Black guy in Deus Ex is pissing me off
<prince-dari> Weren't you there for that conversation Octavia?
<Octavia> 13lol
<Ghosties> 4Time to neutralize
*thatonepony chips area around head
<prince-dari> Count yourself lucky.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Is this synth-reinforced neoBritney?
<Polarfire> So I don't have as mush time for my Dari-bear <3
*thatonepony brushes off excess
<Octavia> 13I... think I missed it lol
<Octavia> 13Awwwww XD
*DannySwish nuzzles Fluttershy, saying goodbye. He flies up and away, going to sleep.
<thatonepony> there, now to the rest of the body
<Dermathil> I may have missed it or forgot it too though
*Spin lays flat mouth agape under neath Blacklight collecting chocolate in his mouth.
<Octavia> 13I kissed a girl and I liked it!
*_Fluttershy_ smiles and softly dozes off...
<prince-dari> Aww, yeah it sucks, we aren't on at the same time much any more.
*thatonepony chips off fore legs and upper body
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Katy Perry. <3

<Spin> :3 yes
<Polarfire> D:
<Beefchief> Do you guys know about the Yipyip aliens from Sesame Street? The ones that go "Yiiip yipyipyipyipyipyip"
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I kissed a girl and I liked it. Then that girl kissed another girl and we all liked it.
<Luna> 07and I liked it!
<thatonepony> some of that has been on the floor
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> danny is pervy for fluttershy
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> x.x
<DragonRage> >Badass Applejack
<`BlacklightShining> “Um…could you not do that…”
<thatonepony> sigh sigh sigh
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Oh dear. . .
<Polarfire> When I get home from school its your bedtime already.
<Spin> Sorry dude but chocolate is chocolate!
*thatonepony chips more mid body and back legs away
<thatonepony> almost done now
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I dislike Katy Perry. . . .. . . . but she does have a point. . . . . o\\\\o;;; inb4 shot

<Beefchief> Do you guys know about the Yipyip aliens from Sesame Street? The ones that go "Yiiiiip yipyipyipyipyip"
<Octavia> 13Haha
<thatonepony> and
<Octavia> 13Indeed Dari.

<Natleyn> ono;
*TheLotusTeaDragon is openly bi.
<prince-dari> Well on the plus side.
*VioletVanilla is secretly secret~
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Don't feel bad. :D
<thatonepony> now, Blacklight, you will be much stronger, and have a greater appreciation for chocolate covered treats
<Octavia> 13VV XD
*Luna is secretly a secret too
<prince-dari> If you get drunk, it doesn't matter who you wake up next to in the morning.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0SHHHH DON'T TELL ANYPONY
<prince-dari> :P
<Lordlyhour> I have Vinyl scrathc dancing on my screen. Your arguments are INVALID!
<thatonepony> and spin, you will get something for eating all of that chocolate as well
<Beefchief> I only mention the Yipyip aliens because I just downloaded the official iYip app that SesameStreet put out. They make a very explicit pony reference.
<Octavia> 13A secret wrapped in an enigma?
*`BlacklightShining stretches out his wings, then folds them back in.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0Oh yeah Dari? You would know? ;D
<Octavia> 13Indeed Dari <3

<mib_99slu0> awwww yeah1!!!
*`BlacklightShining brushes it away.
<thatonepony> yes, Spin, for eating the chocolate which strengthened blacklight
<Beefchief> Sesame Street has officially embraced ponies.
<thatonepony> you to will be affected
<Bommster> What was the last video? D:
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Will had a small part in Six Degrees of Separation. Good movie.
<thatonepony> too*
<Spin> Ohhh what with *continues collecting chocolate from the floor*
*`BlacklightShining licks a foreleg. “I still taste like chocolate…”
*Octavia 13thinks of Carlton dancing to Art of The Dress
<thatonepony> uh
<Octavia> 13HEAD LIKE A HOLE <3
<prince-dari> LOL
<Lordlyhour> So
<TheLotusTeaDragon> LOL
<Lordlyhour> What was the reference?
<prince-dari> I like the way you think Octavia.
<thatonepony> that will wear off with a shower Blacklight
*Spin lifts his head high "YOU DO?!?"
<Octavia> 13<3
*Dermathil thinks he'll head off to cry himself to sleep thinking of the mediocrity that his birthday was. (basically, got 1 phone call saying happy bday, 1 email 'bout it, and that's pretty much it, on top of the discount coupons that I'm probably not going to go to Subways enough to use all)
<Awesomeshy> so
<thatonepony> so yeah
<thatonepony> spin
<Bluestorm_S> NICE
<Nittany_Tiger> NIN.
*Thunder_Dash hugs Dermathil
<Bluestorm_S> ROCK IT VINYL
<thatonepony> for eating the chocolate
*Spin glomps BlacklightShining!
*Octavia 13loves this song
<thatonepony> you will have
<Awesomeshy> we're definately merging with ponyirc.com
<DecapKing> yay!
<thatonepony> a HORRIBLE STOMACHE ACHE
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Don't feel bad, Dermathil. For my birthday, my parents bought me new license plates. That was the entirety of my birthday.
<Dermathil> also, 1AM in the morning.
<Spin> YES!
<Luna> 07awesome editing this vid + awesome song = win
*Lordlyhour YAAAAAY~!
<thatonepony> seriously
<thatonepony> you ate all that chocolate
<The_Creep> It's not that bad Dermathil. Surely some friends around here wished you a happy birthday?
<thatonepony> with FICTIONAL HORSE HAIR
<Dermathil> TheLotusTeaDragon: but was your 17th birthday like that?
<thatonepony> that isnt healthy
<DecapKing> best video editing that i have seen for a PMV yet
<Spin> Now for desert *looks at Blacklight*
*Lordlyhour is glad he didn't eat any
<Dermathil> The_Creep: 10 of them on facebook, total.
<prince-dari> Any idea when services switching/merging will take place?
<`BlacklightShining> GAH!
<thatonepony> not edible
<thatonepony> at least no more than before
<Skyflash> Alright, everypony! Back to Cloudsdale for this pony; glad I could help with the science!
<thatonepony> just stronger
*`BlacklightShining pushes Spin off of him and dashes away.
<The_Creep> You are acting like ten is a small number
<TheLotusTeaDragon> No, it was my 30th birthday. For my 17th birthday, I received nothing. We were almost homeless at the time.
<Natleyn> ):
*Spin gallops towards BlacklightShiining.
<thatonepony> you are credit to science flash man!
<Awesomeshy> actually
<thatonepony> and spin
<Ghosties> 4I'm sorry your birthday went so shitty, Dermathil. If you want, I could give you a royal blast off?
<Awesomeshy> i was trying to get ahold of you about that
*Lordlyhour attempts to make fondue out of Blacklight
<thatonepony> serioulsy take some pepto bismare or something
<Awesomeshy> I want to know when it would be most convenient for you
<Dermathil> hehehe, yeah that'd be nice Ghosties.
<thatonepony> whatever you call it
<Polarfire> Ghosties is terrible.
<Polarfire> XD
<Octavia> 13I'm sorry your Birthday was so crappy, Dermathil. :(
*Natleyn hugs Dermathil
*Octavia 13hugs Dermathil too
<thatonepony> and Blacklight aint chocolate!
<Dermathil> cyall soon
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I do hope you feel better, Dermathil.
*`BlacklightShining “AAHH I'M NOT EDIBLE!” he screams, taking to the air and making for the Bucket.
<Ghosties> 4Awright
*Polarfire joins the hug
<Dermathil> needs some rest
<Natleyn> I'm sorry your birthday was bad .__.
<Octavia> 13I never get anything for my Birthdays either. I've never even had one Birthday party. :(
<The_Creep> Goodbye Dermathil. The cake was nice.
<Luna> 07nighty Derma
<thatonepony> jeez, take a shower before it gets unsavory
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Aw. Poor Octavia. :(
<Awesomeshy> also instead of 4, we shold have about 6 or 7 servers soon
*Lordlyhour dashes after him YES YOU ARE!
*Spin grips Blacklight by his tail and begins to pulling him back. "he DOES taste like chocolate!"
<Natleyn> Hope your dreams are awesome, Dermathil!
<Awesomeshy> </overkill>
<prince-dari> Damn.#
<Octavia> 13Lmao
<prince-dari> Never had a birthday part?
<Octavia> 13<3
<prince-dari> party*
<Octavia> 13Nope
<prince-dari> Wow.
*Thunder_Dash hugs 'Tavi as well
<thatonepony> dont worry Blacklight
<`BlacklightShining> AHH! LET ME GO!
<Octavia> 13My Birthdays were always lonely affairs
*Spin begins chomping down on his tail.
<prince-dari> XD
<TheLotusTeaDragon> That's a shame, Octavia. Everyone deserves to be remembered on their birthday.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0waitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwait.
*Lordlyhour will cappily canibilize a pony, if they're tasty, but draws the line at licking them
<^Stargazer> I think this pony is going to bed, I'll see you fillies and gentle colts later
<thatonepony> your strength even now is increasing
<`BlacklightShining> OW! Cut that /out/!
<thatonepony> you should be able to break free
<Polarfire> All this sadness
*Lordlyhour thats how RUMORS get started
<VioletVanilla> 6,0No. Octavia. You ARE having a party. :l
<Polarfire> is making me sad.
<Octavia> 13lol <3
<thatonepony> plus that stomache ache has got to kick in like any minute
<prince-dari> Aww. <3
*`BlacklightShining kicks Spin, trying to make him let go.
<prince-dari> Don't feel sad.
<VioletVanilla> 6,0When is your birthday?
*^Stargazer stretches and heads to his house for the night
*Natleyn hugs Octavia
<SuperBrony64> Wow, didn't know today was 09-10-11
*Spin 's chomping gets more rapid climbing his tail at faster pace.
*Lordlyhour pounces on Blacklight and starts chewing his leg
<Polarfire> I've always had pretty good birthdays. :/
<Octavia> 13I'm so shy though irl. TOTAL Fluttershy. Complete with squeek and everything.
<Natleyn> Not anymore over here :<
<prince-dari> Hm, how long would downtime be?
<thatonepony> sigh
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Aw. <3
<Natleyn> D'awwww!
*Octavia 13hugs Natleyn back <3
*thatonepony restrains Spin and Lordlyhor
*`BlacklightShining screams in mortal agony.
<Thunder_Dash> Same here, 'Tavi. Only... without the squeak, pretty much.
*Spin eventually reaches the end of his tail.
<thatonepony> wow
*VioletVanilla hugs Octavia gently, making sure not to let her squeak.
<thatonepony> just wow
<Octavia> 13I'm bi-winning!
<DragonRage> Likewise on the Total Fluttershy thing.
<Lordlyhour> SHould've infused his with Boiled candy
<Pontang> As long as we have the new servers up, there really shouldn't be.
<prince-dari> I used to be kind of Fluttershy.
<thatonepony> dark chocolate is nasty
<prince-dari> But I decided fuck that.
*Octavia 13squeeks anyway <3
<Lordlyhour> That hard stuff no-one likes
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I started off life as a Fluttershy. Over many years I became more like Twilight Sparkle, and then Rainbow Dash. Now I'm a mix of Dash and Pinkie.
<thatonepony> and you are trying to get MORE of the taste?
<prince-dari> And that I'd be outgoing and if people didn't like me, screw them.
<Lordlyhour> He would've been strong AND safe from attacks fromponies
<Pontang> We'll just switch the DNS over for awhile.
*thatonepony smacks spin
<Lordlyhour> exept elderly ones
*Thunder_Dash hugs Octavia again
<Pontang> Or whatever Kabaka wants to do.
<Lordlyhour> I LOVE dark chocolate
<Octavia> 13Wewt, my Birthday is in 12 days. X3
*thatonepony smacks lordly for thinkin he knows science
*Spin breaks free and joins back in pursuit of BlackLight.
*Ghosties 4Octavia
<Natleyn> Fluttershy most of the time, Dash around friends.
<Ghosties> 4LOL
<VioletVanilla> 6,0I was a Fluttershy until i began Music Performance. And then I became a Rainbow TwiDash thing. . .
*Lordlyhour continues to Gnaw on the leg
*Ghosties 4hugs Octavia
<TheLotusTeaDragon> The best thing I ever learned was that no one really knows who they are, let alone what they think others should be. I became comfortable with who I was.
<VioletVanilla> 6WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?!
*Octavia 13hugs Thunder_Dash too <3
<free> dont break me
*thatonepony laughs as they continue to 'eat' decoy
*Spin tackles blacklight and bite down on his forehoove.
*`BlacklightShining screams. “HE~LP~!”
<VioletVanilla> 6WE NEED TO HAVE A PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Lordlyhour most certainly isn't eating a decoy
<Octavia> 13lol Yay party! <3
<Natleyn> I'm not so much a fan of this song, but I love how it syncs with the animation
*thatonepony wondering if they have figured out the decoy's mouth isnt even moving
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I agree. There aren't enough parties in life.
<Octavia> 13Pinkie Pie Style!
*Spin keeps gnawing away "good eating!"
<Natleyn> Err, last song.
*Lordlyhour knows the taste of a Chocolate imbue'd ponywhen he tastes one
<VioletVanilla> 6I promise you, there is not a moment that day that you will forget it is your birthday.
<BitZero> BSoD, I laugh at you haughtily!
*Octavia 13wonders if her Brony housemates will give her a party
<Octavia> 13Probably not. lol
<VioletVanilla> 6THEY BETTER
<prince-dari> I still can't believe you have brony housemates.
<Thunder_Dash> With people I don't know, I'm definitely a Fluttershy. To sort of acquaintances, Twilight, and with my friends... I'd say AJ or RD.
<thatonepony> Blacklight your immunity to this sort of thing has almost reached completion
<prince-dari> That's pretty cool. XD
<thatonepony> just stay out of their sites for like one more minute
<VioletVanilla> 6OR I WILL FLY ACROSS A FRICKEN OCEAN TO THROW IT FOR YOU.
*Lordlyhour actually rigged the Decoy to explode and strapped it to Thatonepony's bacl
*TuxRug has been putting himself in a character's mind, and picking songs from my iTunes library...
<Octavia> 13Yup, all four of us are Bronies. The rooms are even all named after characters. :P
<thatonepony> and seriously Spin, i'd recomend seeing a doctor
<Polarfire> So how many more years of school do you have left?
<Octavia> 13Yay VV! <3
*Lordlyhour has gnaw'd off the leg
<Pontang> These servers are going to be replaced anyway. But might as well keep them until the payment is up.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there is so much awesome in that statement octy
<`BlacklightShining> (no, they're actually trying to eat me, not a decoy)
<Luna> 07that's awesome
*Spin turns around and attacks thatonepony."I need more!" MOAARR!
<Natleyn> If I could fly to where you were, you'd have such a party
*Lordlyhour wanders away with it in his mouth
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I...there are no more words for it...just awesome
<Luna> 07well my bf is a brony too :P
*thatonepony watches the decoy strapped to my decoy expload
<prince-dari> Any time from now is fine then.
<TheLotusTeaDragon> That's awesome, Octavia. I'm the only Brony in a 5 mile radius. LOL
<`BlacklightShining> (…wait, this is inconsistent)
<thatonepony> huh
*Spin tackles Lordlyhour. "MINE!"
<Thunder_Dash> That's awesome, if I knew where you are I'd totally throw a surprise party for you XD
<thatonepony> and, time
<`BlacklightShining> (are they trying to eat the real me or not?)
*VioletVanilla has no brony people near her. Her family banished her to the moon when they found out.
<Spin> i was
<thatonepony> YOU ARE INVINCIBLE (to being eaten as well)
*Lordlyhour kicks Spin in the nads and flies away, gnawing on the leg
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you should have your roomies join us for the S1 stream and S2 premiere :P
<prince-dari> If it's done by the end of Tuesday, I'll be happy.
<Natleyn> ;~;
*TheLotusTeaDragon knows how that feels
<Octavia> 13Awww, VV. :(
<Spin> damn!
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanilla
*Thunder_Dash hugs VV
<Lordlyhour> (we are)
*Octavia 13hugs VV
<thatonepony> they really liked your decoy
*Polarfire is secretly counting down the days until Dari has to start looking for a job
*Luna hugs Violet
<Lordlyhour> (and I've got your leg)
*Spin sets his gaze back on Blacklight.
<Octavia> 13They are going to Val lol
<TuxRug> I haven't had any time to actually sit in front of my computer and pick songs, but already Spike has an NSync song and a Maroon 5 song in his playlist, and Pinkie Pie has picked "Move Your Feet" by Junior Senior
<Octavia> 13Before I even knew it. :P
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<thatonepony> Blacklight, remember the extra decoy we made from your mold?
*`BlacklightShining is currently hiding in the Bucket.
<Natleyn> I don't know how anyone would react except my brother and one friend >.>
<ValtheJean> 2,14 awesome
<prince-dari> Well technically I'm not obligated to go to school any more.
<`BlacklightShining> …yeah?
<Bommster> i watched this pmv before it was cool
<VioletVanilla> 6So many hugs. . .
<Natleyn> I wonder how they ignore it.
<Lordlyhour> (exept I ate that one!
<thatonepony> well, in any case, i do
<Polarfire> oh.
*VioletVanilla feels loved.
<Luna> 07you are
<AllisZero> Ok time for bed.
<Lordlyhour> Dude. You're missing a leg
<Octavia> 13Yayy~ <3
<thatonepony> yeah, you sure at that decoy
<Polarfire> so... tomorrow then? :3
<AllisZero> Night everypony.
<Lordlyhour> its bleeding
<Octavia> 13Hugs are great. :D
<thatonepony> me?
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<Octavia> 13G'night Alliszero
*VioletVanilla also feels hungry.
<Bommster> except it had a lot of views and stuff but still
<AllisZero> See you all tomorrow.
<Lordlyhour> Nuu
<thatonepony> yeah
<Thunder_Dash> Night, Allis
<Lordlyhour> Blacklight
<Bommster> Night.
<thatonepony> uh
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodnight Allis~ :33
*Spin walks up to the bucket and chucklets to himself. "Trust me I'm a doctor."
<Lordlyhour> Just, like, look down
<prince-dari> How are we going to fund the Carribean island though?
<thatonepony> that wasnt a leg
<Polarfire> I'll come pick you up. :D
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Hugs are awesome. I used to give them all the time.
<thatonepony> and thats not blacklight
<thatonepony> that is fluttershy
<TuxRug> Lordlyhour, thatonepony: 'Tis a flesh wound.
<thatonepony> so who cares
<Polarfire> well... That's on down the road a little ways >_>
<thatonepony> she didnt help with the SCIENCE
<`BlacklightShining> …
<Luna> 07night Allis

<Lordlyhour> ^.^
<thatonepony> lets get some medical help
*Natleyn hugs Dari
<Natleyn> Fuck
<Natleyn> yes
<Polarfire> We could have our own brony house. :D
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Goodnight, Alliszero
<Polarfire> with.... just me and you.
*Spin resume the consuming of Blacklight's torso.
<prince-dari> DCD told me to put it on. XD
<Polarfire> >_>
<JackiePie> Hi
<Lordlyhour> You really shouldn't cover ponies in chocolate
<thatonepony> dang, how many models have i made?
<prince-dari> Or he'd have to break some shit.
<Lordlyhour> Imagine if PINKIEPIE was around
<Octavia> 13Dat Link
<Polarfire> It would still be a brony house though :D
<Lordlyhour> None
<thatonepony> and how many can spin eat before he passes out?
*VioletVanilla is loving Link~
<Lordlyhour> Because, if you remember
<prince-dari> That'd be cool.
<Awesomeshy> I'll try my best
<Lordlyhour> I dnoated all your false Blacklights to the staving foals
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this game was so great...
<Thunder_Dash> Agh, Internet, Y U MAKE ME WANT TO FINISH MAJORA'S MASK SO BADLY
<Natleyn> Fuck yeah LoZ
<Octavia> 13lol
<Lordlyhour> We're eating the real thing
*Spin looks up from his pony-meal "good question..why don't we test it out .. for uh.. science"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm hesitant to say better than OoT, but they were both so magnificent in their own way
<`BlacklightShining> (Equestria has starving foals?!)
<thatonepony> no
<Lordlyhour> (eeyup)
<Bluestorm_S> lol
<Bluestorm_S> z
<DragonRage> You're hesitant?
<DragonRage> Buck that.
<prince-dari> Thanks.
*VioletVanilla finished Majora's Mask at least five times when she was thirteen.
<chinasuck_15> hey
*DragonRage knows Majora's Mask is best Zelda.
<Bluestorm_S> OOO CARROTs!
<Lordlyhour> (well, not anymorte)
<thatonepony> if you were eating the real thing then we wouldnt be hearing Blacklight
<Lordlyhour> (he got RALLY overboard with the fake construction)
<thatonepony> also, he's impervious to your eating
<prince-dari> Never played either of those games.
<thatonepony> so, yeah
<Polarfire> So can you technically get a job as a computer engineer in the UK right now?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 man, I loved the game when I was little. But a year or so a go I read a plot analysis of Majoras
<Lordlyhour> he shrieked in pain sevreal times
<Thunder_Dash> I love Majora's Mask, but I'll be damned it took a while to work out (for me at least)
<Lordlyhour> now he's unconsious
<prince-dari> So I'd have to assume they suck.
<Polarfire> Of do you have to go to school more?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 seriously...there was so much to that game
*Ghosties 4only likes Wind Waker
<Polarfire> *Or
<Spin> Yes
<prince-dari> Simply because the graphics must be bad.
<thatonepony> i planted a mic when he wasnt looking
*Lordlyhour is gnawing on a leg bone
<DragonRage> You might like it, Dari.
<thatonepony> and stimulated his pain for authenticity
*VioletVanilla understood the plot when she was young.
<thatonepony> sorry Blacklight
<Spin> well lets see
<Natleyn> Yay~
<thatonepony> i just foresaw this possibility
<prince-dari> Well I could technically, but I doubt anyone would offer me the job.
<prince-dari> MFW no reaction at all
<prince-dari> You guys are boring. :P
*Spin gnaws on Blacklight's neck,"you feel anything?"
<Octavia> 13Set us up da bomb!
<thatonepony> still a model
<chinasuck_15> you're gay prince dari
<prince-dari> Woo!
*Xiagu is unboxing brushable Pinkie Pie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >yfw Link from Majora's mask is in Twilight Princess
<Bluestorm_S> dam lunna
<thatonepony> but at this point Blacklight could let you bit him
*Octavia 13will ungayify Dari
<thatonepony> would have no effect
<Polarfire> You have to go to school more then?
<Sumica> FF fail
<thatonepony> speaking of which
<VioletVanilla> 6>mfw this reminds me of Famicom wars. <3
<JackiePie> No fair, France is getting an Islands of Waikfu cartoon
<Lordlyhour> Doesn't matter
<DragonRage> >mi cara cuando I have no face
<DecapKing> bow chicka wow wow
<Polarfire> For someone to offer you a job, I mesn
<Polarfire> *mean
<thatonepony> you showered yet Blacklight?
<Lordlyhour> He's still missing a leg
*Spin pokes Blacklight's still head.. "Blackliiiight?!?"
<prince-dari> Most likely, yeah.
<DragonRage> The need to make a new Nintendo/Famicon Wars game.
<Octavia> 13GOT'CHA!
<Bluestorm_S> FRIENSHIP LASER!!!!
<KanyeNorthEast> this is pretty intense
<prince-dari> 2 years of sixth form/college
<thatonepony> that. is. the. MODEL.
<DragonRage> Days of Ruin is fun and all, but nobody plays it anymore.
<chinasuck_15> that's not possibly if he likes cocks
<Thunder_Dash> The plot didn't have me confused so much as the mechanics ("Okay, so I have these three days... What do I do with them?" "O...kay, reversing time took all my money. AND reset my side quests." "Oh, okay, I need to get masks instead... But I can't finish all the sidequests in three days!"_
<Polarfire> ah.
<`BlacklightShining> (^)
<Lordlyhour> Because, I ATE EVERY BLACKLIGHT LOOKING THING'S LEG!
<prince-dari> Then probably 3-4 years at university.
<KanyeNorthEast> and thats how equestria was made
<Polarfire> 2 years D:
<Octavia> 13Poor flying Luna <3
<DragonRage> Also they seriously messed up not making The Beast a playable CO.
<Polarfire> 3-4 years?
<thatonepony> maybe the ones in this area
<Polarfire> DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
<DragonRage> Dude was awesome.
<Lordlyhour> EVERYWHERE!
<thatonepony> in anycase
<Bluestorm_S> awww luna :(
*Spin begins eating the base of Blacklight's head slowly hollowing it out until creating a chocolate coated pony mask.
<thatonepony> you finished the shower yet?
<Luna> 07:(
<Lordlyhour> because the power of Magenta lets me do so
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, the plot is understandable. I was talking about the lore/mythology. Plus its connection to OoT and Twilight Princess
*Polarfire starts kicking things again
*Octavia 13hugs Luna <3
<thatonepony> oh, how creative spin
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, that too
<prince-dari> Well, at least I'm not doing medecine like a lot of people at my school.
<prince-dari> 7 years here.
<`BlacklightShining> (…okay, now this is just getting ridiculous)
*Luna feels loved
<Lordlyhour> (yup)
<Polarfire> yeah.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not to mention the implied fate for Link in it
<Spin> (haha)
<Lordlyhour> (thats the fun of it)
<thatonepony> well if you finish your shower it will end
<Spin> (I'm entertained)
<Octavia> 13Dat walking Celestia
<`BlacklightShining> (so…I'm just going to put an end to it /right/ /now/)
<FourCartridge> Hello everypony.
<DragonRage> Ohai Lyra.
*Thunder_Dash hugs Luna
<thatonepony> hello there
<Lordlyhour> Hey fourcartridge'where do I know your name from?
<Polarfire> Being a doctor requires a lot of college here also.
*DragonRage hugs Luna.
<thatonepony> tinycartridfe?
<Natleyn> FUCK YEAH
*Spin is amazed as the pony peices start morphing back to gether"but we ate hi..BLUUUGGHHG"
<Thunder_Dash> I never beat Twilight Princess, but ugh, yeah, implications...
*Natleyn hugs Luna
<Lordlyhour> Its familiar. I've never spoken to you in IRC, but It sounds REALLY familiar
<FourCartridge> DakkaDakka? Pokecommunity?
<Octavia> 13Dang, this first video is 25 minutes long...
<Lordlyhour> Nuup
<Octavia> 13YU DO DIS TO ME EQD
*DragonRage is getting chills.
*Spin pukes out all the chocolate coated pony emptying his gullet.
<FourCartridge> I've never seen you before.
<thatonepony> and, there is the sickness
<thatonepony> knew it would kick in sooner or later
<FourCartridge> How about Boo's Mansion? I used to go there.
<DragonRage> Damn it, Nintendo, why haven't you made a new F-Zero?
<`BlacklightShining> (BTW, nothing after my last post will be included in the transcript)
<FourCartridge> transcript of what?
<Lordlyhour> Can't say i ever did
<Natleyn> They're silly.
*Spin watches unphased by his regurgitation as the pony chunks begin to take the form of Blacklight's body once again.
<Lordlyhour> eh, i'll just let it bother me
<`BlacklightShining> (and I'm probably going to end up throwing the whole thing out anyway and just say vaguely that thatonepony dipped me in chocolate)
<Lordlyhour> maybe on kongregate.
<Natleyn> Darn it, now I'm hating Capcom again...
<Lordlyhour> Or the twokinds forums
<FourCartridge> I go there
<FourCartridge> Kong
<`BlacklightShining> (maybe redo it later in a less BS-y way)
<Bluestorm_S> yeah

*VioletVanilla begins sweating
<KanyeNorthEast> them bedroom eyes
<thatonepony> Blacklight whatchu talkin bout?
<Spin> eh whatever floats your boat I think I took my pony cannibalism very seriously.
<prince-dari> So this is how you ungayify people.
<prince-dari> :P
<Thunder_Dash> Oh, I... Uhm, hi Twilight...?
<Bluestorm_S> wheres rainbow dash

*JadeniIsThinkingofYou growls at Spin, bucking him into a tree
<`BlacklightShining> I'm just discarding the transcript of this session
<thatonepony> this is only a theorty though
<Natleyn> >w>

<Ghosties> 4<KanyeNorthEast>: oh man, best cover ever

<Octavia> 13Trying to seduce me again no doubt...
<`BlacklightShining> but it's going to have to be somewhere where I can make sure there isn't all this other stuff going on
<Natleyn> TWILIGHT

<Synros> 14back to gray
<Octavia> 13lol
<`BlacklightShining> thatonepony: normally I would have copied the raw transcript, edited it, and published it as part of the Bucket Roleplay Archives
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> Or cuddling...

<Spin> "REPENT IN THE NAME OF JESUS ALMIGHTY!!!"
<Polarfire> That would get you a good computer science degree.
<Bluestorm_S> i salute you
<prince-dari> I was either at a party or a mountain.
<Lordlyhour> No
<Lordlyhour> because jesus was just a guy
<Synros> 14well i owe it to her
<VioletVanilla> 6DON'T. STOP. ME. NOW!
<prince-dari> :|
<thatonepony> huh??
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> No, he wasn't.
<Lordlyhour> who went around and said things
<`BlacklightShining> I consider this part of Blacklight's timeline, and so I'd want it archived for reference and stuff (i.e., to answer the question ‘Why does he taste like chocolate?’ if and when anypony asks later)
<thatonepony> so, you take events that happen on chat
<KanyeNorthEast> the 10th doctor will always be my favorite, they should get Tennant to do a voice cameo
<Lemon_Lime> I think this conversation needs to end right here.
<Octavia> 13Lmao
<`BlacklightShining> some role-plays, yeah
<Lordlyhour> and then had them misinterpereted for the nex sevreal millenia
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> He is the son of our creator and ruler.
<`BlacklightShining> and archive them
<thatonepony> and you make it like a story???
<AlphaOmega> OK Lets maintain the Love and Tolerance of this channel, by not bringing in Religion and Polictics .
<KanyeNorthEast> for mlp, i mean
<thatonepony> hmm
<Octavia> 13Or a party on a mountain!
<`BlacklightShining> thatonepony: no, not a story
<prince-dari> OH GOD
<prince-dari> MUST DO
<prince-dari> DO WANT
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> Thank you.
<thatonepony> im not sure how to feel about htat
<prince-dari> DFKSOPAFKASPDOGKASPOGKAESR:GLAKSDVPAOWEKfg
<Lordlyhour> No
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I think I'd pass out from the overload. LOL
<Lordlyhour> There is no god
<thatonepony> it sounds like a story
<Lemon_Lime> Seriously. This conversation needs to end o.o
<Octavia> 13<3
<`BlacklightShining> just…they're published
<prince-dari> Dammit Octavia.
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> Because, I was talking to SPIN, not LordlyHour.
<prince-dari> Now I NEED to do that.
<DragonRage> There's a reason I quote this song during one particular scene in Fall Weather Friends.
<Thunder_Dash> Tennant for Dr. Whooves' VA?
*Spin squeezes inbetween Lemon_Lime and Jadeni,facing Lemon_Lime, "This is uuh for your own ~mm good!"
<SirSprinkles> 6HEY, GUESS WHAT
<SirSprinkles> 6SOFN
<thatonepony> make it a story for sethisto
<thatonepony> lol
<Octavia> 13Pinkie Pie would approve of this idea. :d
<DragonRage> That's 'cause of the other PMV of this song.
<KanyeNorthEast> yeah, for atleast one episode
<Octavia> 13:D
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> Shut it, Lordly.
<prince-dari> Next mountain I go to.
<`BlacklightShining> if you /really/ /want/, I might
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> You cannot control my religion.
<Lordlyhour> Why?
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> So please stop.
<prince-dari> I'm taking the biggest battery powered speaker I can.
<Lordlyhour> You can't control my lack of religion
<TheLotusTeaDragon> They'd have to resuscitate me.
<prince-dari> At the top of the mountain, epic rave.
<Octavia> 13Lmao
<thatonepony> also, any chocolate tastes will be EXTREMELY faint, i can assure you
<Octavia> 13MOUNTAIN RAVE!
<Lordlyhour> so perhaps it would be best to leave mention religion out of the pony caht?
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> You can speak your opinion, but you can't be rude and bash my religion.
<Lemon_Lime> ...
<thatonepony> and this would be a funny story
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> You started the argument...
*Octavia 13pictures moutain goats with glowsticks
<Lemon_Lime> I suggested that in the first place.
<Lemon_Lime> -.-
<thatonepony> at least to me
<Octavia> 13... wut
<prince-dari> LOL
<TheLotusTeaDragon> I love Dashie. LOL
<AlphaOmega> Religion and Politics 2 topics that should be left out of pony chat. If youw ant to discuss it there are other chatrooms and even PM boxes for that
*Spin remains squeezed against Lemon_Lime.
<prince-dari> I think I would explode.
<Lordlyhour> Effectually, everytime anyone anywhere says anything is the one true god, they're bashing everyone else's religion
<prince-dari> And orgasm.
<prince-dari> If that happened.
<Octavia> 13 /)^3
<Octavia> 13Darnit!
<Synros> ello
*Lordlyhour is far too easily involved in arguments about religion
<KanyeNorthEast> though I imagine it'd be hard to explain it to him about specifically why they want him to do a va
<Vhose> Love and tolerance, people. Regardless of beliefs.
<Thunder_Dash> What dari said, haha
<ValtheJean> L.O
<Octavia> 13My keyboard chopped Dashies other hoof oof :(
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> You JUST said you didn't believe in god!
<Spin> AlphaOmega: ya if we're being serious leave that out of the chat I'm just teasing Lemon and Jadeni
<Octavia> 13*off
<DragonRage> /)^3^(\
<`BlacklightShining> because it implies that everypony else is wron—okay, I'm not getting into this *backs out again*
<JadeniIsThinkingofYou> so WHY do you care?
<KanyeNorthEast> "well you see, we've got this big fandom for our show...and they think one of the characters is you"
<prince-dari> R.U.B.C.
<Octavia> 13DANCE FUCKER DANCE!
<Synros> 14the cuteness

<`BlacklightShining> thatonepony: it's bas—no
*prince-dari was dancing too hard
<Lemon_Lime> Someone kill him so we can get some harmony back in this place.
*prince-dari knocked shit everywhere
<Lordlyhour> #Arguing_about_religion_if_its_really_that_nessesary
<HaysforPonies> I'm now a 6 sized die with a fancy casino logo.
<RDash> I wonder if the singer of this song has seen this
*Spin rolls a dreidel. "Come on come on!... wait I'm supposed to Spin it>'
<`BlacklightShining> it's basically when you have a bunch of ponies acting out what characters would do
<`BlacklightShining> I think
<`BlacklightShining> maybe
*JadeniIsThinkingofYou flies away from Lordly, rolling her eyes and leaning up against Lemon_Lime
<thatonepony> hmm
<Natleyn> Gaaaah
<thatonepony> why would people do that?
<thatonepony> wait
<Natleyn> I want my mp3 player even worse now. u.u
<`BlacklightShining> Role-playing refers to the changing of one's behaviour to assume a role, either unconsciously to fill a social role, or consciously to act out an adopted role. While the Oxford English Dictionary defines role-playing as "the changing of one's behaviour to fulfill a social role",[1] the term is used more loosely in four senses:
<`BlacklightShining> To refer to the playing of roles generally such as in a theatre, or educational setting;
<`BlacklightShining> To refer to taking a role of an existing character or person and acting it out with a partner taking someone else's role, often involving different genres of practice;
<`BlacklightShining> To refer to a wide range of games including role-playing video game, play-by-mail games and more;
<`BlacklightShining> To refer specifically to role-playing games.[2
<thatonepony> who is Blacklight supposed to be???
<Synros> lol
<Lordlyhour> Glad to see it really Isn't that nessesary
<HaysforPonies> Woah tower text drop

<Natleyn> A few of my friends have gotten these, and aside from one guy leaving his in his pants during laundry day, they've been fine
<Bluestorm_S> applejack's what?
<thatonepony> still, would make a good story, given the circumstances
<Charcoal> So whats the scene?

<Octavia> 13Now that you're science...
<TheLotusTeaDragon> Hm. I may have just got a set of crappy players. It happens.

*JadeniIsThinkingofYou takes off her horse shoes, throwing them one by one at Lordlyhour as she hides behind Lemon_Lime x.x

<NewDCD> For moderating positions, we obviously have them fill the mod form
<NewDCD> Both methods would warrant an interview

<thunder-colt> brb a min
<BlacklightShining> kz
<Fluttershy> random guess
<Lordlyhour> whenever I need to go out for my chores, the dorky thing comes in howling like a srien
<GrimGallop> Do you have some sort of quest log or something?
<Fluttershy> Hopefully it works
<Lordlyhour> Hand, she is
<Natleyn> @lostmeter Dari
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Dari is 47% lost. (1605)
<Lordlyhour> handy**\
<Fluttershy> press 'a' button equivalent?

<Lordlyhour> Hooty?
<Spin> hoofy
<Fluttershy> He is roleplaying with me too?
<Lordlyhour> hoofty**
<Sumica> it's a secret to every one.
<Spin> ya that
<GrimGallop> It's probably in his cache of secrets. He's hiding 24% of the whole game from you, after all.
<thunder-colt> hooty lol
<Fluttershy> ;_; I'm sorry. I'm a Silver hogger
<Lordlyhour> Because, that just sounds crude, somehow
<Fluttershy> Can you forgiveth me?
<GrimGallop> Lies. You only got 97% on your love meter. I got 98% <3
<Lordlyhour> like, its not obscene, but not for lack of trying
<Fluttershy> <3
<Natleyn> Why wub woo
<Natleyn> <3
<Sumica> @sharemeter Fluttershy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Fluttershy is 83% share. (1608)
<Fluttershy> ^^
<Lordlyhour> anyhoots, I'd best go and chore it up
<Fluttershy> @kindmetter Fluttershy
<Sketchy_Sounds> Blacklight: I dunno if I have time. I have like an hour and a half before I'll have to grab a bus.

<GrimGallop> @cutemeter 10,000,000 Fluttershies

<Synros> 14hey dragonrage
<prince-dari> Most likely. XD I wish I could stream something else and talk at the same time. :<
<prince-dari> We could have you commenting on the game.
<thunder-colt> i should probably ask mah parents for the bill just to confirm
<prince-dari> :P
<Fluttershy> you can though...? if you want my stream link? xP
<Fluttershy> I dares you
<prince-dari> Sure, PM me.

<Synros> 8hey Dari I'll send you those pictures sometime next week
<BlacklightShining> thunder-colt: …wait, then how are you here if you're banned from the network?
<prince-dari> Ahaha.
<prince-dari> What, with you in them? :P
<Sumica> Bad news only one new ep showed back to back
<thunder-colt> thats what i don't understand
<thunder-colt> everytime i get an ban message, i reboot my router and get a new ip
<Synros> 8yah the ones oh me...uhm doing..you n
<Synros> 8know
<thunder-colt> sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt
<BlacklightShining> that's ban evasion…
<Synros> 8ha, I do requests too
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<prince-dari> ;)
<BlacklightShining> you should probably just quit now and appeal it
<thunder-colt> believe me, i have tried
<BlacklightShining> and not rejoin until—
<thunder-colt> they have a vendetta against sbc global
*Nittany_Tiger heads off to bed.
<BlacklightShining> well it's not affecting me…
*thunder-colt shrugs
<Synros> 8nitenie Nittany_tiger
<thunder-colt> i have no clue
<JackiePie> What the heck, you have proof of this so-called conspiracy?
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, I actually am in bed :p
<Nittany_Tiger> Night.
<Natleyn> Night Nittany_Tiger!
<prince-dari> Dat ad.

<JackiePie> Hi
<prince-dari> Night.
*DannySwish is currently looking at Jupiter
<GrimGallop> Later
<DannySwish> :D
<thunder-colt> its almost as if they're just banning ip addresses
<Sumica> And here I thought people would want to know that.
<Synros> 8love that video
<thunder-colt> and i just happen to land on banned ones after rebooting
<JackiePie> There has to be a reason, and coming in here complaining about conspiracies isn't going to make you look good.
*DannySwish bought a cheap filter. Jupiter is yellow.
*DannySwish takes filter off.
<DragonRage> That voice is so soft.
<DragonRage> Who is that?
<prince-dari> That's Fluttershy.
<GrimGallop> Fluttershy
<DragonRage> Ah.
<GrimGallop> Clearly :P
*DannySwish sees 3 moons too :D
<Synros> 8Flootershoi
*DragonRage is somehow surprised that Fluttershy has an adorably soft voice like... well, Fluttershy.
*DannySwish lost $12.00 :(
<thunder-colt> D:
<Synros> 8hey Dari.
<prince-dari> ?
<Synros> 8can we play a game?
<prince-dari> What game?
*Silvermane wishes that he could turn on his stream without the computer dieing
<Synros> 8well we have 20 people in chat right now
<Fluttershy> I'm sorry
<DannySwish> how DannySwish can operate a telescope with hooves is unknown.
<thunder-colt> automagically
<Synros> 8lets play the ban game?
<Octavia> 13Uhh... lets not. lol
<prince-dari> I don't think I know how to play. XD
<prince-dari> Remind me.
<prince-dari> :P
<Synros> 8darn
<Synros> 8oh crap
<AlphaOmega> Very well thank you
*GrimGallop hides the banhammer
*Octavia 13thinks its probably a bad idea XD
*Thunder_Dash goes back to hiding
<DannySwish> it goes to shuff automagically! :D
<DannySwish> GoTo telescope
<Synros> 8whats the worst that could happen Octavia?
<DannySwish> I wanted to see the rare Supernova that happened but it's out of my view :(
<thunder-colt> aww
<DannySwish> the last one that was this bright was 25 years ago, and it wasn't as bright as this
<GrimGallop> I'll play your game >=D
<Synros> 8we'll just blame it on Ghostcrawler
<prince-dari> Tell me the rules of this game.
<Synros> 8or Dari
<Octavia> 13lol
<Synros> 8ok here are the rules
<atomic7732> my telescope broke
<GrimGallop> Nope~
<thunder-colt> I wish I had a directional antenna and a vhf radio
*DannySwish 's shaking from the cold is jiggling da telescope 3:
<atomic7732> one of the motors don't work anymore
<GrimGallop> I've been prepared for this since earlier. *Scrolls up*
<Synros> 8we make everyone a mod, then on the count of 3 we all type in a /ban and see whos left
<atomic7732> my telescope is the reason I have this laptop...
*DannySwish 's giggling jiggles it even more X3
<Synros> 8it fun, no?
<atomic7732> it was for an eyepiece camera...
<GrimGallop> That is a HORRIBLE idea.
<DannySwish> lol
<atomic7732> but...
<DannySwish> I tried for HOURS to get it to work with my laptop, no success.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<GrimGallop> But that's what makes it fun. What was I, 98% demented?
<prince-dari> I could go for that.
<DannySwish> wait, I must get back to Jupiter
<DannySwish> lol
<prince-dari> But meh.
<atomic7732> naw my laptop is just for the camera itself
<Synros> 8Grimgallop, everyone knows there is only on true banhammer
<atomic7732> not for controlling the telescope... the camera is USB, so it's like super easy to use
<prince-dari> But unfortunately only if EVERYONE was here and no one AFK.
<Synros> 8and its in Molestia's bedroom
<prince-dari> Becuause otherwise they might not know what's going on.
<GrimGallop> o.o
<prince-dari> And they've just been banned for no reason.
<prince-dari> So.
<Silvermane> Synros, why wouldn't you use kicks instead?
<Synros> 8but thats the fun of it Dari
<DannySwish> I /should/ take pictures of what I see, but it's too small to really come out nicely
<prince-dari> Meh
<DannySwish> I have yet to see anything other than Jupiter, Saturn, and the Moon
<Synros> 8..uhm bans are more fun Silvermane
<Synros> 8ok well it was worth a shot
<Synros> 8:(
<DannySwish> Oh, I saw some deep sky object at Chabot Observatory, but forget what it was
*Synros 8goes into hiding
<prince-dari> If you want to go and make new channel for it that's fine.
*DannySwish wants to see SUPERNOVA
*Octavia 13really hopes Synros was kidding and pickin for fun 3<3
<prince-dari> But I can't condone it with AFK people here.
<atomic7732> I've looked at... lesse... Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and the moon...
<prince-dari> BLUEBLOOD
<Octavia> 13>prick
*DannySwish just hit his nose on the eyepiece. ow.
<thunder-colt> uranus
<prince-dari> 4EVIL DOER
<DragonRage> Wjat.
<atomic7732> I've also seen some double stars, like Mizar
<Synros> 8lol no Octavia, Ive been a mod for only 2 hours..I am dead cereal.
<DannySwish> Oh, I forgot, I saw Venus once
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Blueblood Returns (Update Story 3!) (http://tinyurl.com/5vywxyr)
<Octavia> 13lol Yeah...
<DannySwish> It was unimpressive heh
<GrimGallop> Brb
<atomic7732> I got it as it passed behind a house
<atomic7732> it was orange and setting
<DannySwish> okay, I see three moons jutting out from Jupiter. One is close, and the other two are a bit farther out. Who can guess what moons I'm seeing?
<Octavia> 13Also "guis, I'm super cereal!"
<atomic7732> I'm a member of the AAVSO, and joined just before my telescope's tracking motor blew out... a few days before I finally figure out how to work it... I got to track R Leonis for a few days
<Synros> 8me gusta
<Synros> 8cerrela
<Octavia> 13Bueno!
<Synros> 8muhaha
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, sorry but I can't be of help right now. this computer is a POS, and turns off randomly. I can find you the Mardek Guide link if you want
<atomic7732> well obviously the Galilean. let me see.
<prince-dari> Ah, nevermind.
<DannySwish> I luvv this telescope! It hasn't moved from Jupiter at all!
<DannySwish> yaay fur tracking! :D
<DragonRage> Four parts in one update?
<DragonRage> Jesus, these fanfic writers.
<DannySwish> I think my fave of what I've seen so far is Saturn
<atomic7732> Io, Europa, and Ganymede
<DashiteAlt> You could always just kick all the idle people first. :p
<prince-dari> I love that PMV.
<DragonRage> Likewise.
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Rising Tension (Update Part 5+6+7+8!) (http://tinyurl.com/3f9hsmd)
<Synros> 8I wrote a fanfic once,
<atomic7732> errr
<DannySwish> after all, my cutie mark /is/ Saturn
<DannySwish> heh
<DannySwish> yeah, that's right
<atomic7732> Callisot, Europa, and Ganymede
<Synros> 8never got around to posting it to EQD
<DragonRage> I wrote two fanfics, then struggled and failed to write anymore.
<DannySwish> But watabout Calliso?
<atomic7732> I think it's actually Callisto closest to Jupiter...
<DannySwish> I don't know if it's Ganymede Or Callisto
<DragonRage> Right now I'm writing a painfully OOC AU TF2 crossover.
<DannySwish> I only see 3
<atomic7732> Io's behind Jupiter
<DannySwish> No, Callisto I think is farthest
<prince-dari> Let's write a fanfic in the chat right now.
<prince-dari> :P
<DannySwish> Io's behind Jupiter? are you sure?
<Synros> 8sounds interesting
<Polarfire> me gusta
<Synros> 8don;t let Dari start
<Polarfire> >_>
<Polarfire> <_<
<atomic7732> yeah, but since it's orbit is circular, it can appear closer to Jupiter than the others at times, remember.
<DannySwish> Then I'm certainly seeing Europa, Ganymede and Callisto
<Polarfire> let him start it :3
<Synros> 8ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, inb4 Dari x Boulder happens again
<Sumica> Bound to be shipping if Silvermane is still around.
<Synros> 8ha
<DannySwish> Once, out of luck, the first time I ever saw Jupiter, three moons were perfectly aligned with each other and Jupiter, going out to the right
<DannySwish> It was really cool
<prince-dari> ...
<Synros> 8ok fine Dari starts
<prince-dari> MFW wut
<DragonRage> Mostly I'm following the Pony+class setup CancerousCinema had for his videos, except I decided to go with Gilda as The Demoman instead of Zecora.
<atomic7732> well seeing as that image is for 4 AM EDT... and right now it'd be 4 AM EDT...
<prince-dari> I think flash just crashed.
<prince-dari> Or the page refresh.
<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU=
*Silvermane has an idea. Each pony writes a /me line set, then hands it off to another pony in chat to continue.
<prince-dari> Oh well.
<DannySwish> for me its 12:50AM

<atomic7732> same here

<Synros> 8wb Grim
<thunder-colt> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, thunder-colt!
<thunder-colt> drag me to bed, derpy!
<DannySwish> Okay, so, I have two lenses. One is excellent quality, but is 26mm (aka makes the image too far away) and the other is crap and is 9mm (makes it bigger)
<DannySwish> DO YOU SEE MY DILEMMA?
<atomic7732> you need one in the middle
*DannySwish iz moneeless
<DannySwish> da corporate evils eated it
<DannySwish> :-$
<Synros> 8its quiet...to quiet. Dari is plotting something
<atomic7732> I ordered a pack online one time that got me a 12.5mm and that was decent, as well as a 2x barlow
<atomic7732> it also had a 32mm I think
<GrimGallop> So...
<prince-dari> Dark clouds swirled overhead as Dash leant over the limp cold body a purple pony. Twilight had been trying to fight /them/ off, but they were too strong and numerous - the purple pony had given her life so that her friends might live another day on this earth. There was no stopping them though, all of Equestria would fall.
<DannySwish> I was stupid. I had an opportunity to buy a whole fricken kit for the price of one good one alone. And it included that good one. And I didn't buy it.
<prince-dari> Dash looked up at the sky and screamed:
<Synros> 8wat ever happened to the fanfic in IRC?
<DannySwish> DERP
<DannySwish> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<DannySwish> heehee
<Synros> 8there we go
<atomic7732> my weather station is being stupid right now
<prince-dari> You have to be in the stream to get it. :P
<atomic7732> it's gone off 3 times tonight
<prince-dari> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<GrimGallop> I have a red button like that saved in my bookmarks
<prince-dari> The pants weren't dead, and they had killed Twilight.
<prince-dari> KASDPFGLAS{PGALGP{FADFLGH
<prince-dari> So.
<prince-dari> Someone tell me.
<Silvermane> (the pants were dead? WHY?)
<atomic7732> due to a really high temperature of over 112 degrees, which it is definitely not...
<GrimGallop> Go to instantrimshot.com. I use that one all the time.
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Not sure if trolling
<Silvermane> it's not a trol
<Silvermane> troll
<Silvermane> i've been there, it's legit
<prince-dari> MFW site called "instant rim shot".
<prince-dari> >_>

<prince-dari> ^
<DannySwish> well, eh, kinda
*GrimGallop is bricked
*Hayfever has astigmatism and does photography.
<DannySwish> not really, it still looks fuzzy, but maybe that's becase that's as clear as it can get
<DannySwish> hmm
<DannySwish> I don't /remember/ seeing a difference with my glasses on...
<Sumica> Did't take some one long to use that shot of Applebloom
<DannySwish> Yeah, i guess it doesn't matter
<atomic7732> I like to take my glasses off when I look into the eyepiece, but that's just me.
<atomic7732> It'd better that way, imo
<atomic7732> *It's
<JackiePie> what about getting contacts?
*DannySwish tests the compensation theory with his left eye, which is worse
<GrimGallop> 4:08 AM~
<DannySwish> yupp, thats how it works, I can fix it to my eye
<DannySwish> okay
<DannySwish> but that means what is focused for me isn't focused for others -_-
<JackiePie> Hurray! I helped!
<Sumica> Was that fade slider you are the video Dari?
<AlphaOmega> Pats for Patrick!
<JackiePie> reset it when you're done?

<GrimGallop> Roses are often used as a sign of love, but they wither within days. It's almost like saying, "I love you for your looks, but once you grow old you're worthless to me."
<DannySwish> aand the chat...dies.
<DannySwish> aand the chat…dies.
<GrimGallop> Potatos, on the other hand, don't wither. Even if you leave them in the bag, they'll sprout and keep growing!
<DannySwish> agh, stupid Colloquy!
<DragonRage> This is why you don't pick the bloody things.
<Sumica> When life gives you potatpes you stick them on the end of your Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device.
<DragonRage> You keep them in a garden so they don't die so quickly.
<DragonRage> >I wanna be a pie.
<Denied_Existence> >I stole your face
<GrimGallop> And, unlike, roses, they aren't just for appearances. They can be enjoyed in *countless* ways. They can be boiled, baked, fried, cut into chips... a potato is like saying, "I love you in a thousand undying ways."

<Spose> Oh yeah
<Spose> I remember that.
<Fluttershy> It's a compliment by the way. David Bowie is sexy... in the way that the Rocky Horror Picture Show was sexy
<Efreet> And Wolverine is Canadian.
<JackiePie> Do they also wear heavy Goth makeup like the CMC did in Show Stoppers?
<Efreet> no.
<Fluttershy> oh dear...
<Fluttershy> Did Dari fall asleep?
<Efreet> Oh and you killed Jean.
<Efreet> She's dead again?
<DragonRage> Poor guy.
<Efreet> Don't change the subject, ey!

<Mason_Trowel> Eeyup
<MrPoniator> Downloaded the magneto clip now
<Iks> those crazy videos with effects and recutted dialogs?
<Colgate> you take short segments of videos and make new videso out of em
<Fluttershy> so am I not the only one who thinks he sounds like Bowie sometimes?
<Mason_Trowel> Pretty much, Iks.
<Iks> or the ones where they make music with tiny snippets
<ForeverOdin> Oh Pinkie Pie...you are Pinkie Pie!
<Synros> 8Labyrinth was a good movie.
<Mason_Trowel> The music-based ones 'can' be YouTube Poop, but aren't always.
<Iks> hmm well the crazy ones... i dont know if the makers are totally insane or genius
<Sumica> Eeeyup to both.
<DragonRage> Welp, it's very nearly 3:00 AM here. Gonna head to sleep soon.
<DragonRage> See y'all in five days, I guess.
<GrimGallop> Nearly 6:00 here :P

<Fluttershy> Too much fun for me.
<Turgle> :D
<GrimGallop> So, about playing D&D sometime... XD
<Mason_Trowel> *Kept
<MrPoniator> "... a pony named Magneto!"
<Fluttershy> do you want me to bring Silvermane back? >>
<MrPoniator> I like this Magneto'd at the gala
<GrimGallop> Hang on a second...

<Sumica> nonsense he is clearly full *pomf*
<Efreet> http://www.fimfiction.com/story/755/On-a-Cross-and-Arrow

<Fluttershy> o-o
<Fluttershy> lots of 3s for me
<EspyLacopa> Oh god, after seeing the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Sanji's mini-arc on Ivankov's home island just attained a new degree of hilarity
<Fluttershy> 3 3s to be exact
<Fluttershy> @wingbonermeter everyone
<Steven_Magnet> 6 everyone is 98% wingboner. (1639)
<Fluttershy> ....wow
<Turgle> LOL
<GrimGallop> o.o
<Fluttershy> my goodness everyone what are you up to?
*EspyLacopa is watching One Piece
<Fluttershy> I know what Silvermane is up to but what about the rest of you huh?
<GrimGallop> "Everyone" includes you, you know
<Fluttershy> true true
<Iks> me did read on a cross and arrow
<Iks> its good
<GrimGallop> What are YOU up to?
<Fluttershy> The same thing Silvermane is up to xP
<Iks> kinda a bit.... weird for some of em falling in love with each other
<GrimGallop> Thinking about how sexy Silvermane is?
<Iks> rarity yes i can see that happen
<Fluttershy> Oh is that what Silvermane's doing?
<Iks> maybe even rainbow dash
<JackiePie> Have you seen Lorenzo's Oil?
<Fluttershy> I knew he was a narcissist...
<Fluttershy> j/k >>
<GrimGallop> XD
<Denied_Existence> GrimGallop You are closer than you know...
<Efreet> I generally don't like stories that involve shipping. But On a Cross and Arrow, was nice.
<JackiePie> That movie is so sad, but then the ending is like "Bawww, that's so inspiring!"
<Mason_Trowel> No, never seen Lorenzo's Oil.
<Iks> i think i did see that movie
<Turgle> dun dun duuuun
<Iks> but it was a long time ago
<JackiePie> I wouldn't reccomend it if you watch Rugrats. They had EG Daily do some of the crying in the film, and so it happens to sound a lot like Tommy Pickles.
<Synros> 8ok game time
<Synros> 8anyone?
<GrimGallop> Banhammer Roulette?
<Turgle> rofl
<Iks> ugh i so hated the rugrats
<Silvermane> hrmm....
<MrPoniator> What's Rugrats?
<Synros> 8wow Grim, how'd you know
<Silvermane> i'm a bit distracted by /something/ Fluttershy
<Iks> a bad cartoon
<JackiePie> Old Nickelodeon cartoon
<Iks> about babies
<Silvermane> not exactly worried about me atm
<MrPoniator> Ok
<EspyLacopa> Sanji's hell: An island where all the 'beautiful' women are actually crossdressing men.
<Mason_Trowel> An american cartoon about the adventures babies get into when their parents aren't paying attention.
<GrimGallop> o.o
<Synros> 8lol actually I had a movie guessing game in mind
<EspyLacopa> Led by Emporio Ivankov, the Frank'n'furter expy
<GrimGallop> @chaosmeter GrimGallop
<Steven_Magnet> 6 GrimGallop is 90% chaos. (1640)
<JackiePie> I thought Angelica was funny
<Turgle> ^
<MrPoniator> Hmm, I might remember it
<Mason_Trowel> It wasn't bad, really. Not until later on. It was a real simple and innocent show.
<Fluttershy> Oh yes... sorry for being ah...so distracting Silvermane >>
<GrimGallop> This meter is off by 10%
<Denied_Existence> Did Dari fall asleep?
<Turgle> seem so
<GrimGallop> Probably
<Synros> 8yup
<Denied_Existence> Methinks he did.
<Mason_Trowel> In the later seasons, they started adding new characters, and they kind of messed with the show dynamic a bit.
<JackiePie> I liked when Angelica sang a dramatic version of It's Raining, It's Pouring. lol
<Denied_Existence> "I'm just going to lay down for a se-Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
<Synros> 8anyone wanna play that game?
<Synros> 8"guess the movie"
<Turgle> *ahem*
<Fluttershy> Synros I have random question for you. How long you been a part of BronyState?
<SirSprinkles> 6...sofn
<Silvermane> Fluttershy... <3
<Synros> 8couple weeks
<JackiePie> My mom liked the one where Angelica got mad at her parents, so she drove off in her Cynthia car.
<Sumica> oh look it's SOFN!
<SirSprinkles> 6*noms chat*
<Fluttershy> Yes Silvermane?
<Fluttershy> o-o
<Mason_Trowel> Angelica was great. Also, a bit of trivia for those unfamiliar, the voice actress of Buttercup from PPG was Tommy Pickles, and the voice actress of his little brother Dil (when he was put in the show) is Twilight Sparkle.
<Sumica> dont put that in your mouth who knows where it's been.
<Synros> 8ok SirSprinkles...
<Fluttershy> oh yes... true dat
<JackiePie> Yeah I can hear that with Buttercup
<Synros> 8you take over. I clearly not loved pony here
<SirSprinkles> 6omnomnomnom
<Mason_Trowel> Although, Dil didn't have much in the way of speaking aside from baby noises and shouting "Tommy!" or "Poopy!"
<Iks> i know
<Fluttershy> Synros: just curious. xP I think I am on my way to possibly becoming mod myself
*GrimGallop is dozing off
<SirSprinkles> 6Grrrrrr... Who's being mean to my Synros?
<Lysiria> Whoa, what? Tara Strong is Dil? D:
<SirSprinkles> 6*bark*
<Mason_Trowel> Yes
<Lysiria> mind = blown
*Silvermane licks Fluttershy on the cheek. "Very distracting indeed..."
<Synros> 8no wants to play my games :(
<Mason_Trowel> Well, that
<Mason_Trowel> Means I get to give myself a pat on the back. First mind blown in chat.
*Fluttershy shivers, squeaking and blushing. "Ah... S-Silvermane... others are watching though..." >>
<SirSprinkles> 6*revs up banhammer* Oh, they'll play... they'll play...
<Synros> 8i mean are people that timid of the banhammer?
<Mason_Trowel> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
<Iks> well tara did tons of shows
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, yeah, big time.
<SirSprinkles> 6*takes out camera*
<SirSprinkles> 6Do continue, Silvermane...
<Sumica> I would say get a room but this is a room so, *gets some popcorn*
<Mason_Trowel> Bubbles from PPG, Raven from Teen Titans, Timmy Turner from Fairly Oddparents...she's got a long list.
*Fluttershy blushes, trying to glare at SirSprinkles but can only manage a slightly annoyed look. "Y-you..."
<JackiePie> I think Cosmo is cute.
*Silvermane looks about the gathered audience. "Hmmm... they /did/ ask for it..." He proceeds to glomp Fluttershy, pinning her to the ground. "Your move, sweetheart."
<Fluttershy> >> wait, isn't this room PG-13? Oh dear... )
<Polarfire> not this late(or early?) it isn't.
*Fluttershy gasps, looking up at Silvermane with wide eyes. "But... we're already doing so much in the other rooms...! S-should we really do this /here/...? What will the children think...?!"
<Sumica> All the best stuff comes on after 3am.
<EspyLacopa> We just spent two days watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I think everyone is still recovering.
<Mason_Trowel> Cosmo was probably one of my favorite characters on that show.
<SirSprinkles> 6It is always PG-13... sorta...
<SirSprinkles> 6>>
<SirSprinkles> 6<<
<Sumica> ok now i just feel creapy
<mib_4bzajq> hey SirSprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, anon?
<JackiePie> Too bad they did that stupid live action movie
<mib_4bzajq> can you give Synros, I cannot log back in becuase appererntly Im still in chat\
*Silvermane looked down at Fluttershy. "Children? Frankly, if children are on here a 6am, it's their parents fault. Besides, it's /your/ move. I hold no decision for the moment..."
<mib_4bzajq> kick*
<mib_4bzajq> thx
<SirSprinkles> 6...gonna chang nicks back or not?
*Fluttershy blushes more deeply, but blushes more deeply, her wings starting to unfurl. "O-oh no... my wings...!"
<Fluttershy> oops )
<Mason_Trowel> I never saw it. Was it completed or is it still in production?
<Fluttershy> I hate... errors )
<JackiePie> It was completed
<Fluttershy> ugh. Also tired )
<Turgle> wingboner!
*Donraj yawns
<Fluttershy> You get teh friggin point )
<JackiePie> and the live action actor for Cosmo was nowhere as cute as the cartoon
<Donraj> Can't sleep
<Donraj> D&D game in less than four hours
<Synros> finally gawd\
<Synros> stupid internetz
<Iks> cosmo?
<Mason_Trowel> Well, I'm glad I didn't see it.
*Silvermane looked about, surprised. "Oh dear, it seems the TaRDiS is upset..." as a faint glow overtook him.
<Mason_Trowel> Cosmo is Timmy's Fairy godfather in "Fairly Oddparents"
<Efreet> When Arkham City comes out. I expect -alot- of Harley Quinn voice overs for Twilight.
<Synros> 8MY POWER HAS RETURNED!!
<Mason_Trowel> Why's that?
<Sumica> yay?
*Synros 8grabs the banhammer, and smiles.
<Synros> 8u
<Synros> 8sup
<Efreet> Tara Strong's voicing Harley Quinn
<Fluttershy> dun even think about it...
<Polarfire> I thought half ops couldn't ban?
<Synros> 8nah I would never
<Awesomeshy> >D&D
<Fluttershy> wait we're on the Tardis? huh...? =-=
<SirSprinkles> 6They're not allowed to.
<Synros> 8lol I can't thats wats so funny
<Synros> 8harhar
<Mason_Trowel> That's incorrect, Efreet. She's voice by her original actress, Arleen Sorkin
*Fluttershy squeaked, looking up. "What in the how did we...?"
<Synros> 8i stop noaw
<Mason_Trowel> It's one of their big selling points
<Awesomeshy> Dungeons and Dragons?
<Efreet> wat? Really?
<Mason_Trowel> Yes
<Efreet> They've changed?
<Mason_Trowel> Her, Kevin Conroy (Batman), and Mark Hamil (Joker), are all original Batman TAS voice actors
<JackiePie> I'm going back to bed, night
<Synros> 8so, I'm thinking of a number between 1-100
<Mason_Trowel> And it was Arleen Sorking in Arkham Asylum as well
<Sumica> 42
<Polarfire> 78
<Efreet> Baww. I was looking forward to it.
<GrimGallop> It's 42
<Mason_Trowel> I just double-checked on imdb
*Silvermane looked around. "Oh, i traveled around with the Doctor a few times, and the old girl took a shining to me. She gets jealous at times..."
<Synros> 8nope
<Lordlyhour> There are not enough batman ponies
<Mason_Trowel> *Sorkin
<Polarfire> well this is easy.
<SirSprinkles> 6Is it...
<Synros> 8agaian
<Polarfire> 1
<Polarfire> 2
<Polarfire> 3
<Polarfire> 4
<Polarfire> etc...
<GrimGallop> 3.14159
<Polarfire> XD
<Lordlyhour> I mean, I've seen bats, robin, Harley and, I think, the joker
<Synros> 8dude
<Silvermane> lawl SirSprinkles
<Polarfire> good one sprinkles.
<Synros> 8duuuude
<Lordlyhour> but no-other baddiers outside of that
<SirSprinkles> 6COME AT ME BRO
<Turgle> square root of 2
<Lordlyhour> no scarecrow, no penguin
<Turgle> 1.41
<Synros> 8you you mother....
<Silvermane> is it i ?
<Synros> 8NO!!
<Synros> 8the number is PAIN!
<Lordlyhour> No Bane, no crocodile dude
<Polarfire> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6There's something on your face!
<Mason_Trowel> *Killer Croc
<EspyLacopa> Can I pick e as a number?
<Synros> 8nononono
<Mason_Trowel> And yeah, I know what you mean
<Lordlyhour> Hell, not even Man-bat
<EspyLacopa> i isn't between 1 and 100.
<Turgle> IT WAS PAIN!
<Mason_Trowel> Mad-Hatter is another good one.
<Silvermane> SirSprinkles, ILU <3
<Polarfire> lawl.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Lordlyhour> Though I think Colt-bat would be horrifying
<Synros> 8hands in his mod badge.
*Fluttershy pursed her lips. "I am /so/ confused..."
<Lordlyhour> I really liked the mad hatter
<Silvermane> IT WAS PAIN
<Silvermane> lawl
<EspyLacopa> e^(pi * i) + 1 = 0
<Lordlyhour> I HAVE seen a riddler pony
<Turgle> solve.
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying I don't haze new mods for like, a week or son
<SirSprinkles> 6*so
<Fluttershy> there was something on your face....
*Sumica flips the channles, how did it get on boxing, I was watching shipping.
<Mason_Trowel> I think a Two-Face one might exist
<Synros> 8i can kick :(
<Synros> 8should i?
<Lordlyhour> ..Idunno WHY, but batman's villians are my favourite league of evil type bunch
<Synros> 8hmmmm
<SirSprinkles> 6You can't kick me. XD
<Polarfire> kick who?
<Fluttershy> -growls- >>
<Lordlyhour> Most of the other villians in DC sorta Grandstand
<Polarfire> you can't kick him.
<Synros> 8lame
<Lordlyhour> The joker? just kills 'em
<Synros> 8wait ok, where FLuttershy?
<Polarfire> >_>
*BlacklightShining (is messing around trying to get all these command-line-install apps to work)
<bronybrian> toplessrobot.com is great chaek out their fan fiction fridays
*Silvermane stood up, wings full of pomf. "Don't worry about it, she'll learn to deal. And now we are in /private/, aren't we..." He chuckled lightly
<Fluttershy> dis is da way you left me, I'm not pretendin' no hope no love no glory no happy endin'~
<BlacklightShining> YES!
<BlacklightShining> I DID IT!
<BlacklightShining> IT WORKS!
<BlacklightShining> [awesome face here]
<Mason_Trowel> Well, the Joker 'just kills' everyone EXCEPT Batman. He wants Batman's death to be special.
<Lordlyhour> I mean sure, he does do the evil death traps, but, relly, killing his enemies'd really just be a perk
<BlacklightShining> all it took was one symbolic link…
<GrimGallop> Lol
<Lordlyhour> all he wants to do is duck with people's minds
*Fluttershy jumps though as she looks around, and floating above them is says 'BBC'.
<Efreet> This Cake.. It is so delcious
<Lordlyhour> Woot!
<Efreet> Delicious, even.
<Lordlyhour> ACCIDENTAL SELF CENSOARAGE!
<MeteorVenture> i was wondering where that static was coming from and why it felt like i was on skype
<Synros> 8lol i cannoit even remember the command for kick, so u lucky FS
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo
<Synros> 8<---is worst mod evar
<Turgle> and HE is a mod?
<Fluttershy> prolly something like /kick username
<GrimGallop> /kick name?
<SirSprinkles> 6How hard is it to remember /kick is to kick?
<EspyLacopa> Synros: /kick?
<Sumica> it's slashquit
<Sumica> alt f4 perhaps
<Lordlyhour> I must admit though
<GrimGallop> lol
<BlacklightShining> now I can install these four things I wanted but couldn't install before
<Fluttershy> lulz
<Lordlyhour> I love DC comics
<Sumica> Turn it off and on again.
<EspyLacopa> Nah, alt+F4 is a system command, not an IRC command.
<BlacklightShining> hm, looks like I deleted them
<Turgle> oh maaaaaan
<Synros> 8wb Turgle.... :3
<Mason_Trowel> I want to see Tara Strong slip more Raven into her Twilight. She slips into Timmy Turner a lot, but I want some more of that laid back Raven-y snark.
<SirSprinkles> 6You have to delete system32 to kick people.
<Turgle> :D
<Turgle> format c:
<Lordlyhour> I love the snarky!Twilight moments
<EspyLacopa> Turgle, now you're just being mean.
<Polarfire> lawwl.
<Sumica> Is it plugged in?
<Iks> you know what would be awesome.... ashleigh ball working some rainbow dash or applejack into their hey ocean performance
<Lordlyhour> Theres too much Fanfics with Twilight screwing up, magic out of controlling
<Fluttershy> so hao DO you kick?
<Lordlyhour> and not enough of her, cool, calm, collected just breezing through everyone else's fuckups
<Polarfire> OC your cpu to 4.8 ghz. That's the only way to kick like the masters.
<MeteorVenture> you have to horribly damage your computer for it to really shine
<Mason_Trowel> I agree, Lordly
<MeteorVenture> after it catches on fire of course
<Synros> 8ok no more use and abuse
<Efreet> don't you mean duckups.
<Turgle> ^
<Synros> 8Ive had meh fun
<Fluttershy> hardy har har
<Fluttershy> what's the COMMAND to kick?
<Mason_Trowel> And, Iks, I can't really comment on that. I don't actually listen to hey ocean.
<Lordlyhour> Twilight is a badass. Sure, she's a bit of a nerd, sure she's socially inept
<Lordlyhour> but she is fricken awesome
<Fluttershy> I'm curious if I can kick myself for some reason
<Lordlyhour> and you can go to hell efreet
<Synros> 8no I tried
<Synros> 8see
<Efreet> Twilight is my favourite Mane Six Unicorn <3
<Efreet> wtf
<Efreet> ;-;
<Lordlyhour> :)
<Mason_Trowel> Agreed, Lordly. Also agreed, Efreet.
<Fluttershy> dang
<Mason_Trowel> Twilight is Best Pony
<Fluttershy> darnity dang diggity
<Lordlyhour> Indeed!
<Lordlyhour> Derpy is my favourite pony
<Lordlyhour> but Twilight is the best
<Fluttershy> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNAAAHHH....
<Mason_Trowel> Now, we just need to get her into a cloak and dub some Azarath Metrion Zinthos over her.
<Synros> 8SS is probably plotting my demise
*MeteorVenture kicks... it missed
<Sumica> slash gquit?
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<Lordlyhour> heh
<Lordlyhour> i didn;t get that joke
<Mason_Trowel> Teen Titans
<Iks> well neither do i but it would be funny... you know like bands always yelling to the crowds to cheer like "i cant hear you!" *crowd cheers louder* and she then just yells in rainbow dash voice LOUDEEER!
<SirSprinkles> 6I can kick myself.
<MeteorVenture> my accuracy isn't high enough to be a mod yet.. but one day
<Iks> that would be so awesome
<SirSprinkles> 6You have to be at least mod to kick yourself from the chat.
<Synros> 8i can't Ive tried several times
<Mason_Trowel> That would actually be pretty cool.
<Synros> 8oh
<SirSprinkles> 6>OP
<SirSprinkles> 6I mean...
<Lordlyhour> that would cause every brony in the audience to simultaneously...
<Efreet> Twilight, Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy, Mane 6 ponies, for species. Vinyl, Octavia and Derpy for Background.
<SirSprinkles> 6HOP can't.
<Synros> 8wheres the fun in that
<Mason_Trowel> Except if she did that...
<Lordlyhour> and my scentance just goes to EaD material
<Mason_Trowel> She'd get a bunch of ~yays
<GrimGallop> I think I'm going to get some sleep~
<Synros> 8night Grim
<Iks> and then half of the crowd goes yay~
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a thing a lot of servers have set up to prevent new mods from kicking other new mods.
<Iks> yeah
<Synros> 8hope you don't hate meh
<Mason_Trowel> ~You rock. Woohoo.
<Synros> 8(he totally hates me)
<Turgle> ROR
*GrimGallop is swallowed by a vortex of dark mist, vanishing into nothingness. As the mist clears, screams seem to echo from all around, though they don't seem to originate from any specific point.
<Lordlyhour> I have yet to see a fanfic that portrays either an Evil/insane Twilight or a Tyrant celestia in a way I'd find believeable
<Synros> 8^ why would he kill himself?
<BlacklightShining> ^:Lordlyhour
<Lordlyhour> Twilight has the most raw power available to her than THE LIVING GODDESS has ever seen.
<Synros> 8shouldn't play with pure antimatter
<GrimGallop> (Oh, but I'll be back, and perhaps all shall be explained...)
<Mason_Trowel> If you actually enjoy the Doctor Whooves fanfics, I find the method done in "The Traveler" is pretty believable. Mostly because it is the vast amounts of Time Lord knowledge that taint Twilight's mind.
<Fluttershy> GrimGallop goodnight mebbe I will take you up on your horrible D and D pick up line sometimes
<AlphaOmega> The secret of creating an evil char is to add some form of tenderness or kindness to them
<Lordlyhour> If Twilight went insane, she could erase a good portion of equestria off the mao
<Fluttershy> sometime*
<MeteorVenture> i was caught up in some mist once.. i turned into a seru /feelsbadman
<AlphaOmega> it helps as a counterpoint, but also makes them more believable
<Sumica> oh great hidden screamer ending in a pony game. Cute.
<Mason_Trowel> But it is also more enjoyable, since future!Twi and present!Twi are separate characters, and present!Twi is firmly set against becoming the Evil Empress her future self turned out as.
<Synros> 8and so the Meteor strikes again.
<Lordlyhour> Hrrm
<Fluttershy> do you know what Fluttershy sings in the shower?
<Lordlyhour> Theres this one Drwhooves Fanfic i was really liking, but I can;t re-find
<Mason_Trowel> Which one is that?
<Synros> 8wait
<Lordlyhour> the last chapter I read up to ended with something along thelines of "why would a DENTIST have an hourglass for a cutiemark"
<Lordlyhour> and thats all I realy remember about it
<Synros> 8./kick Fluttershy (reason pending)
<MeteorVenture> death metal?
<Iks> cause he lets the patience wait long?
<Donraj> Yes
<Lordlyhour> Colgate is a girl, dude
<Turgle> hard core?
<Mason_Trowel> Huh? Well, can't say that helps me, really.
<Fluttershy> she sings... DISNEY SONGS
<BlacklightShining> she *
*Sumica waits for the joke
<Fluttershy> -dies-
<Turgle> how do you sing hard core?
<Mason_Trowel> Sorry.
<Iks> i thought we are talking about whoof
<Turgle> Fluttershy :|
<Synros> 8that was just terrible
<Fluttershy> I know.
<Fluttershy> hehe
<Lordlyhour> I was talking about a DR whooves fic
<Turgle> :D
<Lordlyhour> Colgate is also a Timeord, apparantly
<Synros> 8now I cannot do anything about it
<Sumica> darn it I cant bring my self to brick the cute.
<BlacklightShining> Colgate is more likely to be a dentist than Dr. Whooves…
<MeteorVenture> you take an apple.. eat the stuff you're supposed to.. then make a song about the rest
<Efreet> Everypony is a Timelord!
<Turgle> in b4: Fluttershy singing i will go the distance
<BlacklightShining> …Colgate being a brand of toothpaste…
<MeteorVenture> that's how to sing hard core
<Iks> i know
<Mason_Trowel> A popukar fanon concept is that Colgate is the Time Lady Romana
<Turgle> HAHAHHAHAHA
<Lordlyhour> MY GOD! IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW!
<Mason_Trowel> A companion from Classic Doctor Who
<Fluttershy> You stomp your wholeself in
<Fluttershy> you stomp your--
<Fluttershy> WAIT
<Fluttershy> i has an idea
<Fluttershy> mebbe
<Fluttershy> I should stream
<Iks> well then SHEEEE has a cutie mark as a dentist because SHEEE lets her patience wait.... like doctors always do
<Fluttershy> e-e
<Lordlyhour> I'd love to see an evil Twilight Fic.
<Synros> 8s......
<Turgle> i approve
<Iks> but when its your turn you are in there for 2 minutes
<Synros> 8ima go eat a muffin
<Sumica> I think we would have to find a way to dislodge Dari.
<Iks> they should make those who would take long to wait long too
<Lordlyhour> Wherein Twilight went completely bonkers. Quite some time before the whole "move to ponyville" thing
<Mason_Trowel> I would direct you to the Traveler, but I think the author might have abandoned the fic.
<Turgle> how?
<Mason_Trowel> A real shame, cuz I thought it was great.
<Synros> 8i know how
<Lordlyhour> and everything was just a delusion
<Synros> 8we all send him suggestive photos of ourselves.
<Synros> 8no...?
<Synros> 8ok...:(
*Silvermane tackles Fluttershy, nibbling on her ear... as he realized she didn't have pink hair... ooops
<Lordlyhour> All her freinds are just corpses she's playing with, animating the whole town by magic
<Silvermane> oopsie, who did I just get frisky with?
<Sumica> not it
<MeteorVenture> we take his house from him that's how
<Lordlyhour> Celestia is all withered and, Bound and stuff. Just, nearly dead
<Synros> 8a little help SirSprinkles
<MeteorVenture> (see: house next to his name AKA lodge)
<Fluttershy> huh...?
<Mason_Trowel> That's...a bit too grimdark for me
<Fluttershy> Why have I no pink?
<Sumica> I think I know a way but i was going to bed and if I started streaming I would have to stay up.
<Lordlyhour> The whole NMM thing was, indeed the Return of Luna, but she actually came back fairly normal, and had to be beaten up by twilight
<Silvermane> (because it wasn't you, Fluttershy)
*Synros 8makes Fluttershy pink, and stuff.
<Lordlyhour> the reason we don;t see her agian the rest of the series is she;s off gathering help
<MeteorVenture> dislodge = take that lodge next to his name away
<Lordlyhour> The Grand Galloping Gala and all the Lead up? Twilight Made a Move on Canterlot
<Synros> 8doesn't Dari live in a castle?
<MeteorVenture> Lodge generally refers to a compact dwelling intended for infrequent stays, as for hunting, etc.
<Fluttershy> how am I not me...? eh?
<Sumica> almost sounds like he's going for a qwertyui face.
<MeteorVenture> so ya normally he probvably does
<Lordlyhour> Parasprites? Made to try to destroy Twilight's zombie minions
<Synros> 8ah..I'm so terrible tonight..i'm just going to sit over there.
<MeteorVenture> probably*
<Lordlyhour> Phweet!
<Efreet> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOoZ9doAiW8&feature=feedu
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Game Fails: GTA IV &quot;Worst thing done to an NPC... ever&quot;
<Lordlyhour> THIS CRACK IDEA? IT HAS REACHED HIGH ENOUGH CRACK LEVELS TO APPEAR O MY BLOG!
<Fluttershy> IDENTITY CRISIS
*EspyLacopa throws pink hair dye at Fluttershy
*Sumica wispers to Fluttershy, he glomped some random pony thinking it was you but it wasn't cause you went to go get a muffin.
<Efreet> oh my god..
<Efreet> that video..
<Efreet> My crotch hurts now.
*MeteorVenture fluttershy
<User_6976> e frunk guy is back
<Efreet> 2nd comment = I lol'd
<User_6976> b man answe me dammit
*Shaico waves to Donraj.
<Lordlyhour> Sympathetic Pain overload
*Donraj waves back
<MeteorVenture> oooh... i just thought of something.. testing for science!
*MeteorVenture Fluttershy
<Fluttershy> -is now a science experiment-
*MeteorVenture x Fluttershy
<MeteorVenture> there whoops
<Turgle> he blinded me with science!
<Fluttershy> SILVERMANE
<Fluttershy> ISSUE
<Fluttershy> STAT
<Donraj> I know you from #EquestriaDaily, yes?
<Fluttershy> MeteorVenture thinks to claim a MeteorVenture x Fluttershy ship!!
<MeteorVenture> i can has fanfic?
<MrPoniator> Heh
<Shaico> Yeah, thought lately I haven't been active there.
<Donraj> Thought so
<Donraj> Same
<Silvermane> WHAT
<Fluttershy> OH TEH NOES DON'T BE FOALISH
<Shaico> Mostly because of the ridiculous convos
<EspyLacopa> I go! to the grocery store
<Fluttershy> I KNOW WHO I AM NAO....
<Shaico> I hang out in EAD now. x3
<Fluttershy> I AM...
<Sumica> Oh look we are shipping overnight again.
<Fluttershy> FLUTTERRAGE!!
<Iks> its a game character....
<MrPoniator> Is it me, or is Super Filly Adventure getting popularity because of the "bad ending", as opposed to the other parts of the game?
<Donraj> I never really got into that chat
<Shaico> Yeah I recognize you. That's why I waved.
<Donraj> I just lurked and occassionally made comments
<Silvermane> !!!
*Sumica hands Flutterrage a bunny.
<Lordlyhour> Bad ending?
<MrPoniator> Bad ending, yep
<MeteorVenture> wait.. i just got rejected by fluttershy.. she was even too afraid to say she couldn't go up a mountain to see a dragon.. FOREVER ALONE
*Silvermane hides in the woods, muttering about unnauthorized shipping in his bronystate...
<Shaico> Your comments must have been clever if I remember your username.
<Efreet> What's the bad-ending like? I only got the good ending. Lol
<Mason_Trowel> I only played one ending
<Mason_Trowel> The Super Filly ending
<Fluttershy> -kicks MeteorVenture with a karate chop- HEEEYAH
<MrPoniator> You should play it for yourself to find out
<Efreet> Fine then. I SHALL!
*Efreet tip hat
*Efreet storms off
<Iks> challenge accepted
<Mason_Trowel> The game was alright, but I don't like endings where you have to actively attempt to do things counter-productively to get an alternate ending.
<Iks> is what you say in this kind of situations
*MeteorVenture deflected it with his fist
<MrPoniator> 1) Talk to everyone, up until they start repeating themselves (make sure you talk with Pinkie before handing over all invintations), this includes pets 2) Bake a good muffin and give it to Derpy, 3) Play the game between 11PM and 5AM (just cheat and set your computer's clock)
<MrPoniator> And then, just go back to Zecora
<Fluttershy> LE GASP
<Lordlyhour> and then you DIE!
<MrPoniator> oh my!
*Fluttershy flies into the wall with a epic CRASH, causing a crater! Then with a groan she falls to the ground, a large lump rising on her head. Flutterrage is gone... and in her place is Fluttercry!
<Lordlyhour> Does she gobble you up, in a big tasty brew?
<MrPoniator> Nope
<Sumica> Oki night all. Have fun storming the castle and such.
<Lordlyhour> ...damn
<MeteorVenture> i would feel bad but *takes off Fluttershy's mask* i learned that you were actually big mac a while ago
<Turgle> bye Sumica !
<MrPoniator> That'd have been cooler, I think
<MeteorVenture> for super obvious reasons
*Silvermane rushes to the rescue, curling around Fluttercry in a protective shell of fur and feathers.
<Fluttershy> ....The hell?
<Fluttershy> MeteorVenture don't ruin my epic rp!
*Fluttershy is immediately set into tears as she forces her self up, eyes wide and sad. "H-how could you...?"
<Synros> 8want me to take care of him Fluttershy?
<MeteorVenture> *the mask never came off*
<Lordlyhour> but you really do die?
*Fluttershy is stunned by the request! "N-No... you... you don't need to." She says in her quiet, demure and trembling voice.
<MrPoniator> See for yourself
<Lordlyhour> NO!
<MrPoniator> You can watch it on YouTube if you don't want to play it
<Lordlyhour> I like hot tamale!
<Donraj> Well, I try
<Lordlyhour> is it really that popular?
*Efreet is trying to load it. Internet is -really- slow.
*Synros 8goes back to the fetal position in his corner...crying.
<Lordlyhour> thats actually the reason I haven't played it yet
<Lordlyhour> How many endings ARE there?
<MrPoniator> The game itself isn't that special. Just that the bad ending is... Well, yeah
<Lordlyhour> how bad?
<MrPoniator> Apparently three, and one of them is just the super filly with Derpy being in the party or so
*Fluttershy continues to fill her audience full of d'aaaaaw for she is so adorably cute and the words so admirably descriptive that everyone is caught in the whir of emotional tension that is causes!
<Lordlyhour> scary bad?
<MeteorVenture> *starts crying* i don't know what else to do.. i think i'm trying to summon nerdy friends
<Lordlyhour> wtf bad?
<Lordlyhour> just plain BAD bad?
<Fluttershy> caused* )
<Awesomeshy> Donraj: I hear D&D is p fun actually
<Donraj> It is
<MrPoniator> That depends entirely on you
<Awesomeshy> I've never done it though :c
<Lordlyhour> ...eh
<Lordlyhour> I think I'll pass
<Donraj> I grew up reading D&D sourcebooks
<Donraj> Never played it until a few years ago
<MeteorVenture> *nerdy friends arrive* stuff just got real
*Silvermane rushes to the rescue, curling around Fluttercry in a protective shell of fur and feathers.
<BlacklightShining> chat slowed /way/ down
<MrPoniator> Thanks to me
<Lordlyhour> SOO! anyone wanna check out my blog? I promise it will be sexy
<MeteorVenture> me: nerds! help me out here! nerds: we'll think of something
<Lordlyhour> as in awesome, sexy
<Lordlyhour> not sexy sexy
*Fluttershy is taken by surprise by Silvermane's gallant and very well timed arrival! (Even though he posted before ah well) Fluttercry stares up at her guardian with wide eyes. "Silvermane...!"
<MeteorVenture> *intelligence rises*
<Iks> whats it about
<Lordlyhour> Sexy sexy belongs elsewhere. I.e. in a scentance not refering to a blog reffereing to me
<Lordlyhour> Basically, I take input
<BlacklightShining> [03:51] Lordlyhour: SOO! anyone wanna check out my blog? I promise it will be awesome
<BlacklightShining> assuming you mean that ^ sure
<Lordlyhour> and then, using my disease lump of a brain,explain that with a Crack theory
<Lordlyhour> YEs
<Lordlyhour> That is exactly what I mean
<Lordlyhour> Dammit, I cnt manage a mootone on IRCs
<Lordlyhour> http://thelordlyhour.tumblr.com/
<Fluttershy> LEVEL UP
<MeteorVenture> PK FIRE! *uses PK Fire*
<Lordlyhour> Because monotones are great when talking about something. they make it soundlike you mean the opposite of what you're saying you;ve just learned what you are saying by rote
<Lordlyhour> Currently, I have no input
<Lordlyhour> hence no more output than I;ve gotten in here in the lst few days
<Fluttershy> BONG! Reflected by Star Fox's handy-dandy reflector!
<Mason_Trowel> Hmmm...I am dissatisfied. Well, not dissatisfied, per se, but more or less sad.
<MeteorVenture> *hits it with bat*
<Mason_Trowel> On a Cross an Arrow is complete...and yet I want more of it to read
<Efreet> Me too..
<Lordlyhour> indeed
<Mason_Trowel> Perhaps I can hold out hope for a sequel.
*Silvermane forgets his line, so he stands there holding Fluttershy
<Lordlyhour> There'll be a second story, I think
<Fluttershy> K-RACK POW! Oh teh noes what will happen nao?!
<MrPoniator> Oh yeah, I gotta read the latest chapter
<Efreet> I want to see the Stallion versions in the Mare's Ponyville. ALong with their CMC.
<Lordlyhour> Because it ended both plothook and kind of weak
<Fluttershy> MASTER HAND APPEARS!
<Mason_Trowel> I want the CMCs to meet each other
<Lordlyhour> Oh god
<MeteorVenture> but.. dangit i was aiming for that tree over there > ^ < v
<Lordlyhour> ...CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS, LOVE TRIANGLE! YAY!
<Lordlyhour> Love star of david?
<Mason_Trowel> Double the CMC, double the fun.
<Fluttershy> Then swoops down and grabs the LITTLE PONIES below [aka Silvermane and Fluttershy] easily, pinching them like bugs.
<MrPoniator> Could someone pass up the fimfiction link?
<Mason_Trowel> ...Why did you immediately think to ship them?
<Mason_Trowel> XD
<Lordlyhour> Love Intersected sextagon?
<Efreet> http://www.fimfiction.com/story/755/On-a-Cross-and-Arrow
<Mason_Trowel> http://www.fimfiction.com/story/755/11/On-a-Cross-and-Arrow/Part-11:-And-Back-Again.
<Efreet> iwin
<MrPoniator> thanks
*Efreet victory dance
<Lordlyhour> Because 3 of the mane 6 fell in love with themselves
<Silvermane> (oh my)
<MrPoniator> Mason's link was more convienant
<MrPoniator> HE WINS
<Efreet> .....
*Efreet goes off and cries
*Mason_Trowel shakes his hooves triumphantly in the air.
<Mason_Trowel> ^_^
<Lordlyhour> though already, two of them WERE in love with themselves
<MeteorVenture> *uses taunt* < v ^ > (< dance dance arrows)
<Lordlyhour> i'm not sure where Fluts self love comes from
<Lordlyhour> what I wanna see
<Mason_Trowel> I think that the author chose the perfect pairings in that regard.
<Lordlyhour> is the two realms dragged together
<MeteorVenture> *taunt over* alright chums up! lets do this
<Fluttershy> DANCE FAWKERS DANCE! )
<Lordlyhour> so, there are two of everypony
<Efreet> Oh god. Two Derpys
<MrPoniator> Mason, what? Shipping everypony with themselves except go for Aj x RD?
<MeteorVenture> *dances again*
<Lordlyhour> No, they've already met
<Lordlyhour> where do you think Dinky came from
<Lordlyhour> I mean, sheeh
<Fluttershy> the competition has been narrowed! Only three players remain! [For it seems the majority of them have probably retired to sleep for the night and will be in for quite a surprise when they look at the logs!]
<MrPoniator> Though, Twilight wasn't that as much
<Mason_Trowel> Flut's self-love stems from the fact tht nopony she has ever known has loved the things she has loved as much as she does. Since Butterscotch is her opposite, he DOES share that love, which essentially makes him her perfect stallion.
