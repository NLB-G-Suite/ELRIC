<Meanwhile> I can't remember what season, it was the episode when 7 of 9 got captured by that pit fighting ring.
<Ictiv> Hm...
<Phase4> i'm getting curious. what happens in shed.mov?
<Meanwhile> Also, can't unhear Find a F:[ing pet in this.
<Phase4> is it a curosity i shoud fight?
<Phase4> ohai Jim
<Dken2021> just avoid it, trust me
<Jim> Good morning guys
<Meanwhile> You're not allowed to talk about shed.mov
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: Was he dressed in an alien suit? i might recall him a bit
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> depends Phase4
<Meanwhile> Morning Jim.
<FlutterMoist> Phase4, just say no
<Meanwhile> Ictiv: no he wasn't.
<Dken2021> lali-ho Jim
<Big_Jakeintosh> Phase4: just watch it its not that bad but not that good either not near as funny as apple.mov
<Espeon> 06lol
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: I think I'll need to watch that again
<Phase4> Big_Jakeintosh: i didnt find apple.mov that funny...
<Meanwhile> He's not around for long, he knocks 7's block off in her first fight.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Lets not talk about the .movs
<Big_Jakeintosh> Phase4: well its certainly funnier than dress.mov
<Kammerjunk> I hope I'm not the only one who song along there.
<Ictiv> Oh wait, I confused it with the episode where Tom and Harry are put in a space jai
<Ictiv> jail*
<LordCelestia> 0,5for the sake of the shed one
<Ictiv> Hm...
<Phase4> Big_Jakeintosh: havent seen that either
<Meanwhile> Yeah not that one.
<Dken2021> the .MOVs have evolved from newgrounds humor to just downright disturbing
<Phase4> to watch the .mov or not
<Kammerjunk> ...I'm not the only one who sung along, right?
<Phase4> that is the question
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: i would have but theres people here
<Meanwhile> Just do it and move on with your life.
<Big_Jakeintosh> Kammerjunk: I always sing along ;)
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk: You honestly need to ask that?
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Yes.
<Kammerjunk> Yes, I do.
<Ictiv> :|
<StinkomanFan> My cat won't leave me alone!
<Meanwhile> First world problems.
<Ictiv> Let me remind you that you're talking with mr Come With me....
<Ictiv> And you'll be...
<Presea> gn
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: Well, there's a party going on outside my door and downstairs.
<Ictiv> In a World of Pure Imagination!
<Kammerjunk> NONONO
<Meanwhile> In a world of pure inebriation...
<Kammerjunk> Living there,
<Ictiv> Take a look...
<Jim> There's two moose standing in my garden o_O
<Kammerjunk> You'll be free
<Ictiv> And you'll see..
<Kammerjunk> If you truly wish to be.
<StinkomanFan> In a world of pure imagination yeah yeha yeha
<Dken2021> new pitchman?
<Ictiv> Into your imagination
<Meanwhile> I don't even know the words to that song.
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<FlutterMoist> Mays > this guy
<Kammerjunk> This guy is a bad Billy Mays.
<Kammerjunk> Herdmind.
<Kammerjunk> Bah.
<Kammerjunk> Mays sold for $19.95.
<Phase4> this looks like a usefull product.
<Dken2021> needs more volume
<Meanwhile> Flex Seal sounds like an action figure you give little seals.
<Phase4> sure its avaliable for less though
<Ictiv> All the kewl kids use flex seal
<Lucid> BILLY MAYS > Everyone
<Dken2021> he's a bad vince as well
<Meanwhile> I'll flex seal your face.
<StinkomanFan> He's a decent salesmen but really? You can't compare with CAPSLOCK MAYS
<Phase4> brb, have to move a thing
<Ictiv> Lucid: Except Bud Spencer
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: And that's saying a lot
<Meanwhile> Royal canterlot Mays.
<Jim> Mays is best pony
<Kammerjunk> Fan fav'rite mareathon.
<Lucid> I don't even know who Bud Spencer is
<FlutterMoist> A single tv could broadcast a Billy Mays commercial over much wider area than other commercials
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my head is killing me but i must keep watching ponies
<Ictiv> Lucid: He's the greatest man alive. He's so great the pentagon built Chuck Norris to try and beat him... he failed at beating Bud
<Starflash> Back :3
<StinkomanFan> BRB gotta move my lappy somewhere less cat-filled
<Ictiv> he's also italian
<Meanwhile> dat thing.
<Starflash> Ohey Phase4 is still here =w=
<Jim> Isn't Mays dead though?
<Ictiv> He's dead Jim
<Meanwhile> Way to ruin the mood Jim.
<Starflash> Oh and ohai Jim :)
<Dken2021> tank sure does a good rollout
<Jim> hey Starflash
<Meanwhile> Dat duck.
<Kammerjunk> "This isn't a game, you know!" "Now these games will determine..."
<Kammerjunk> I see what they did there.
<Starflash> Eeeyup
<Jim> Hehe
<Kammerjunk> Silly Dashie.
<Kammerjunk> That'd be slavery.
<Starflash> QuACK!
<Meanwhile> Dat tortoise.
<Starflash> Owl used Feather Regrowth!
<Davie_Jones> Nope.avi
<Meanwhile> Lol butterfly.
<Davie_Jones> Did anyone else's stream just fail?
<Meanwhile> Not mine.
<Starflash> Nope
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 hipnofly
<Davie_Jones> weird
<Starflash> hipnofly
<Starflash> <.>
<Jim> It happened to me earlier, but I just hit play and it got back to where it was supposed to be
<Meanwhile> Quack.
<Davie_Jones> did it again
<Meanwhile> How did it to do that boat?
<Kammerjunk> Dat theme tune.
<Starflash> ...magic
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Fluttershy.
<Meanwhile> Tortoise.
<Kammerjunk> Stalker turtle.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dun dun duuuun
<Meanwhile> DUN DUN DUUUUN
<Davie_Jones> Fossils!
<Kammerjunk> Oh yes.
<Kammerjunk> Ride of the Valkyries.
*Ictiv waves conductor's stick around.
<Davie_Jones> inb4 specific wording trope
<Kammerjunk> Wagner is so awesome, but still not as awesome as ponies.
*Ictiv turns into 80s bully and locks Davie_Jones in his locker.
<Kammerjunk> Dat 4th wall?
<Meanwhile> What 4th wall.
<Kammerjunk> Quite.
<Ictiv> Kammerjunk meant when She whistles with the background music
*Davie_Jones turns into an 80s geek and makes Ictiv's bank account disappear.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> metal slug anyone ?
<StinkomanFan> Jim doesn't watch ponies iwth me at home...
<Davie_Jones> They actually reminded me of metroid
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Here comes tom!
<Dken2021> Misshion, Stawrt!
<Davie_Jones> HI TOm!
<Kammerjunk> Fly up, you featherbrain.
<Jim> 'tis a lie! I watch ponies all the time
<Kammerjunk> Or at least look up.
*Ictiv doesn't mind much because his 80s deadbeat parents that gave him deep emotional scars, turning him into a bully put like two dollars on his account.
<Meanwhile> Foreeveeeeer
*Ictiv still gives Davie_Jones an 80s wedgie.
<Kammerjunk> Don't leave me now. Don't say it's the end of the road.
<Kammerjunk> Remember the flowers I sent. I need you, babe.
<StinkomanFan> 48 HOURS
*Davie_Jones sets up a water and flower bomb to explode when Ictiv next opens his locker.
<Meanwhile> You're thinking of flour I think.
<FlutterMoist> Dohohoho
<Kammerjunk> Flower bomb is best bomb.
<StinkomanFan> Giant snake? Tie it up
<Jim> dat teeth bling
*Ictiv has no reason to open locker, but Principal comes along and hears Davie_Jones making noise in his locker and opens door.
<Kammerjunk> This film looks very half-assed.
<Davie_Jones> Don't mess with minime
<Meanwhile> Why would your car randomly be in a puddle of laval?
<Dken2021> did it suddenly turn into high schoo?
<Jim> so....transformers for kids?
<Ictiv> It's a dead brained idea Jim.
*Davie_Jones has no reason to be blamed for anything has he as a perfect record so the blame goes to Ictiv.
<Lucid> Basically
<StinkomanFan> Damned mods won't let me join the AV club
<Lucid> Personally, I like the movies
<Jim> Did I see Dan vs FiM there?
<Kammerjunk> I don't know what you mean, StinkomanFan.
<Kammerjunk> I can join the AVclub.
<Phase4> i'm back. well fed, plenty of water, teath brushed. my body is ready!
<Meanwhile> ^
*Ictiv was in class, Principal also notes that bomb couldn't have been set up with an open door so Davie_Jones must have been the one who made it.
<Phase4> ninjad your ^ Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Tortoise power.
<Dken2021> all the cool kids hang out in shop class
<FlutterMoist> dat strength
*Davie_Jones had an alibi set up before hand.
<Meanwhile> Idk what the AVclub is.
<Jim> Tenage not so mutant not so ninja tortoise
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: It's a room of AV stuff.
<Kammerjunk> And I'm the only one there.
<StinkomanFan> Spike is the new RD!
<Meanwhile> Cool. What's AV stand for.
<Phase4> its the Tank
<Jim> Audio Video
*Ictiv knows even with his bully mind that there is no alibi for beign in a locker with a bomb that can only be set up inside the locker and blows as soon as door opens
<Meanwhile> Sounds...uninteresting.
<Phase4> Ictiv: what about teleportation
<Jim> Brohoof
<Kammerjunk> Have two pets, then.
<Jim> Wait, does tortoises have hooves?
<Meanwhile> No.
<Jim> Or what do you call those?
<Ictiv> Phase4: Yeah, becasue every 80s school kids can teleport
<StinkomanFan> Ah man, Beuller wants me to skip with him but I've got a test today :(
<Davie_Jones> Rarity is allergic to dust.
<Kammerjunk> yay?
<Meanwhile> yay?
<FlutterMoist> yay?
<Kammerjunk> Ha.
<Meanwhile> yay.
<Phase4> Ictiv: of course they can, havent you ever seen clockstoppers?
<Davie_Jones> Specific wording trope
<Jim> d'aaaww
<Meanwhile> I'd love a pet falcon.
<StinkomanFan> !cd
<ChanServ> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 0 days, 2 hours, 1 minutes, 23 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
<Ictiv> Phase4: Let me quote myself "EVERY 80s..."
<Phase4> falcon is a good sport
<Dken2021> Clock Suckers, racing in time to save the day ~
<Meanwhile> Gesundheit.
<Kammerjunk> Gesundheit.
<Ictiv> FALCON HANDSHAWK!
<Phase4> Ictiv: let me quote myself: "herp derp cant brain dont know how to continue this joke"
<Kammerjunk> ...Best out of 3?
<Phase4> its 00:30 here, i'malowed to derp
<Lucid> I have to say, RD's reasoning was kind of weak. Just sayin'
<Davie_Jones> How so?
<StinkomanFan> I ever tell you 'bout the time my buddy Keith and I tried to make a chariot of fire?
<Meanwhile> RD isn't really known for brain power though is she.
<Davie_Jones> Why not?
<Dken2021> well how is she gonna take a ground animal to her cloud house?
<StinkomanFan> Burn marks over 95% of his body!
*Ictiv pats Phase4 on the shoulder. "Wanna share a glass of Pan Galactic?
<Meanwhile> Because she's kinda dense.
<Davie_Jones> How so?
<Lucid> Well, how does she know that the birds and bat all saw her get trapped and left her anyway
<Meanwhile> Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's Maybelline.
<Phase4> Ictiv: um.... no.... i like my brain not wrapped around heavy metals
<StinkomanFan> Rarity is ADORABLE
<Davie_Jones> The fact that there was an avolanche, they were suddenly in the lead, and she wasn't castching up.
<Phase4> now this is...
<Davie_Jones> Oh, and that she was calling after theme.
<Phase4> this is the dress one
<Phase4> whats it called?
<Meanwhile> She's also kind of a sore loser.
<fluttercry> 05,15kind of?
<fluttercry> 05,15KIND OF?
<Meanwhile> I wanted to sound nice.
<Davie_Jones> Yes, but that doesn't matter in this episode.
<Phase4> suddenly fluttercry
<fluttercry> 05,15No RD deserves NOTHING!
<Meanwhile> You can't really decide what part of someone personality applies to what part of their life.
<StinkomanFan> I lost my dental license to that toy
<Dken2021> not even hero for a day?
<Meanwhile> It's not mix and match.
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> my computer hates me today
<Lucid> Also, who's to say she couldn't have more then one pet?
<Lucid> Dken, +1
<Davie_Jones> Nether can you deside what she does without backign it up.
<Meanwhile> Pot calling the kettle black much.
<StinkomanFan> She'll be a crazy cat lady!
<fluttercry> 05,15Are we aruguin in here again?
<Davie_Jones> No.
<StinkomanFan> Maybe
<Meanwhile> Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
<Davie_Jones> I'm trying to correct Meanwhile and it's not sticking.
<Phase4> is the video lagging for anyone else?
<Dken2021> what is this arguing you speak of?
<Meanwhile> To correct me I'd have to be wrong.
<Davie_Jones> Exactly
<Jim> It's not laging for me, not much atleast
<Davie_Jones> Thus, you are.
<Meanwhile> And I'm not.
<fluttercry> 05,15eh it's fine if you do. just keep it civil and all that
<Lucid> There's a difference between discussing/debating and arguing
<LordCelestia> 0,5Nor raging
<LordCelestia> 0,5This is a nice room
<StinkomanFan> Godd damn I was so high I barely remember what I did yesterdat night
<Davie_Jones> Don't you think that's a problem?
<StinkomanFan> Something about ponies happened
<StinkomanFan> That I know
<Lucid> Hey, look. A mod who actually uses their brain. There was a chatroom I used to be a regular in where as soon as an argument about ANYTHING popped up, the mods would crack down. Even if it was a perfectly civil discussion about food or something
<Jim> What kind of chatroom does that?
<Meanwhile> Arguments make mods panic attack.
<LordCelestia> 0,5You can have arguments and stuff, just keep it appropriate
<Davie_Jones> Those kinda mods are afraid of people getting their feelings hurt.
<StinkomanFan> Anypony know what I did last night? Cause it's all a blur for me
<Meanwhile> Or afraid that it doesn't look like they're doing their job.
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/WcHaI i post this during a rarity ep
<Jim> You probably watched ponies StinkomanFan, I don't know
<Meanwhile> Phase4: http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg
<Jim> That's awesome Phase4
<Phase4> Meanwhile: indeed
<Davie_Jones> You touched people inappropiately, Stinkoman. And took their legs.
<Meanwhile> Yeah that was totally you StinkomanFan.
*Meanwhile lairjack face.
<Ictiv> My alsmost avourite song
*Meanwhile liarjack*
<Ictiv> almost*
<Jim> I really like this song
<Lucid> This is the way I look at it. If whoever are debating something and have something to back it up, it's a debate/discussion. When it devolves into "I'm right because you're an idiot" is when it gets to be a problem
<Phase4> and then flash crashed
<StinkomanFan> God, I'm just coughing up phlegm like crazy
<Meanwhile> I don't subscribe to the "I'm right because you're and idiot" school of thought.
<Meanwhile> I do however advocate the "you're wrong because you're and idiot" one.
<Phase4> its about time flash crashed
<Meanwhile> an*
<Phase4> been working for about 16 hoursso far
<StinkomanFan> I try to explain to the idiots what's wrong with there arguement
<Meanwhile> It wouldn't be the weekend without broken flash would it Phase4.
<Ictiv> To bad Rainbow doesn't look like a Tank, she could go to a party with her pet as if they dressed together :D
<Davie_Jones> AS I did, STinkoman.
<Phase4> Meanwhile: indeed
<Lucid> Well, I don't like using that argument, but when that's all the discussion is, it needs to stop
<Meanwhile> Davie_Jones: That just isn't accurate.
<Phase4> faces
<Phase4> all of them confuse
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> and now they all have cat hair on them
<Davie_Jones> Yes it si
<StinkomanFan> Lett talk about last night until I can remember it ok?
<StinkomanFan> *Let's not
<Meanwhile> It isn't, your response to my point was "Nether can you deside what she does without backign it up."
<Lucid> You don't remember the epic bar brawl we had?
<Ictiv> 120%*
<Davie_Jones> AS I was bringing up proof that you were wrong.
<Meanwhile> Despite the fact that my previous point was the "backup"
<Phase4> i wonder how large the source swf's are
<StinkomanFan> Oh look more arguements
<Meanwhile> You can't prove me wrong in this instance.
*StinkomanFan hits panic button
<Davie_Jones> Yes I can.
<Meanwhile> There realistically isn't enough evidence to figure out RD's reasoning.
<Meanwhile> You can only fill in the blanks.
<Meanwhile> And that margin of error is too great.
<StinkomanFan> Dr. Drill and Fill is a terrible dentist
<Phase4> rumor spred by dogs
<Lucid> Oh, that's what we were discussing
<Davie_Jones> There is enough.
<Meanwhile> You can't prove me wrong anymore than you can prove yourself right.
<Ictiv> StinkomanFan: Still not as bad a Dentist The Doctor
<Ictiv> as The..*
<Phase4> dat base
<StinkomanFan> DJ P0N-3 works on the musci for HUB's comercials
<Meanwhile> But I'd still be willing to agree with your idea if it made more sense than mine. What was your idea again?
<fluttercry> 05,15just out of curiosity what's this debate about?
<StinkomanFan> SWEETIE BELLE :o
<Meanwhile> RD's decision to choose the Tortoise.
<Phase4> the twilight room is split betwene wugglepets hate, wugglepets disinterest and a discusision about transformers
<Ictiv> fluttercry: About where debates end and arguments begin
<StinkomanFan> !cd
<ChanServ> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 0 days, 1 hours, 47 minutes, 3 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
<Phase4> :3
<Davie_Jones> That Rainbow Dash had a good reason to choose the Tortoise over the others because the ohters left her after the rockfall and didn't bother to turn around.
<Meanwhile> Debate and argument are both the same thing. Whether or not it is civil is what you're looking out for.
<StinkomanFan> Oh darn, i'd be too busy playing video games
<fluttercry> 05,15RD and Tank are both Loyal. It fits, and it makes the kids happy.
<Davie_Jones> They were all to focused on winning and getting to be her pet.
<fluttercry> 05,15The writers said so
<Davie_Jones> Thank you, Fluttercry. *bows*.
<fluttercry> 05,15that's her reasoning
<Phase4> oh, if the writers said it it must be true
<StinkomanFan> Fluttershy is a choosy jerk
<Phase4> poor fluttershy
<Davie_Jones> Cased close then. It was a nice try, Meanwhile.
<fluttercry> 05,15No no, what I'm saying is the show has to teach a lesson, if she didn't pick tank, I don't know if anything would have been learned
<Phase4> and now poor rarity
<fluttercry> 05,15and Davie_Jones don't take it so seriously
<Meanwhile> Davie_Jones: Don't try and troll me.
<Davie_Jones> Too late.
<Lucid> I'm so happy I learned to play the bass part of this song. Like a boss
<fluttercry> 05,15and by the writers said so I mean, they picked tank, nothing can be done about it
<Meanwhile> You have yet to actually make a counterpoint or original argument. Don't think I didn't notice that.
<Phase4> huh. the nvidia sticked just came off my laptop
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> this plays every time i'm coding
<Phase4> only took it 3 years
<Meanwhile> I could sit here and assume you're terrified of my ability to spell and my logic but that'd just be arrogant. Realistically you just can't think of anything.
<Davie_Jones> I'm going to get a reward for myself for being so right.
<Meanwhile> Hilarious.
<Meanwhile> Play me at chess some time.
<Jim> She's talking about us!
<StinkomanFan> Alright, who here is a physicist?
<Meanwhile> It'd be more interesting.
<Davie_Jones> What does chess have to do with anything?
<Meanwhile> Nothing, but I like chess.
<Davie_Jones> And?
<fluttercry> 05,15Chess is the ultimate test of mental agility
<Davie_Jones> No it isn't.
<StinkomanFan> Chess is boring
<Meanwhile> Thankyou fluttercry.
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> am i allowed to cry during ponies?
<Phase4> its a very complex game
<StinkomanFan> Checkers is for REAL MEN
<StinkomanFan> JUMP THAT KING
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tic-tac-toe
<Ictiv> fluttercry: read a Raymond Smullyan puzzle book some time :)
<Dken2021> you sank my rook
<Davie_Jones> Chess requires lots of practice and the ability to think on multiple things at one time. I don't have that ability
<Ictiv> Anyone Knows "What's the Title of this Book?" or "The Lady or the Tiger?"
<Davie_Jones> I haven't even seen a chess board in over a year.
<Ictiv> or maybe even "The Chess mystries of Sherlock Holmes/The Arabian Knights"?
<Meanwhile> I have a chessboard made of marble, it's gorgeous.
<Davie_Jones> And?
<Meanwhile> and nothing, it seemed relevant to the conversation.
<Phase4> dat eye
<Davie_Jones> It isn't really.
<Phase4> twitch
<Lucid> I have a crystal chessboard. At least I did, I haven't seen it in years
<StinkomanFan> I got a glass chess set for christmas once
<Davie_Jones> Kinda just bragging
<Meanwhile> The conversation is now about chess, explain how it isn't relevant.
<StinkomanFan> I cried for a week at how terrible it was
<Jim> I occationly use the chess board at the library
<Phase4> lolwut StinkomanFan
<Dken2021> chess you say? I suck at that game
<Ictiv> Meanwhile: It's rather about logic no? Or did that branch die off?
<Meanwhile> Ictiv: it died.
<Phase4> dj-pon3 spam
<Ictiv> No one reads Raymond SMullyan I guess
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile i have one made of stone, it's mayans vs Conquistadors
<Phase4> lol, the spam is still going
*Ictiv rubs forehead.
<StinkomanFan> I spent the whole week thinking I was ging to get a video game system
<StinkomanFan> and then the day comes and BOOM Chess set
<Ictiv> The world would be a lot better if people read Raymon Smullyan
<Davie_Jones> The conversation was about how chess was a good test of mental agility. I was freely admitting that I haven't played it in over a year and that it really is more of mental multitasking to think about the many moves of the pieces that yours and your opponinate can take at the same time.
<StinkomanFan> Worst Christmas party ever
<FlutterMoist> nah
<Davie_Jones> You needlessly brought up your marble chess board.
<Meanwhile> That's more like a piece of the conversation as a whole
<Phase4> and aj didnt lear anything
<fluttercry> 05,15My god is this grade school?
<Phase4> hgerp drep ima ture
<Ictiv> ^
<Davie_Jones> Depends, can I got nappy?
<Phase4> tired'
<Meanwhile> No this is the world.
<fluttercry> 05,15Davie_Jones you need a nap
<Davie_Jones> yay! *snuggles with his blankie*
<FlutterMoist> Time to get breakfast
<Phase4> i'ma close my eyes for a bit, ding me if stuff happens
<StinkomanFan> Sold the set to my dad for 8 dollars
<Gumri> Hello everyone! What have i missed?
<FlutterMoist> I'll be back maybe around 9:30ish at latest
<Jim> Hi Gumri
<Meanwhile> Gumri: nothing important.
<Dken2021> jsut a few episodes Gumri
<Lucid> *naps as well*
<Ictiv> Phase4: Define stuff
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hi Gumri
<StinkomanFan> I told a story of how I hate chess and nopony listend
<Phase4> Ictiv: not this. turns out closing my eyes doesnt help anyway
<StinkomanFan> that's about it
<Phase4> ohai Gumri
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: Sorry, tell it again.
<Gumri> I was playing chess the other day :P
<Ictiv> Phase4: Soreness? Try washing with a bit of cold water
<StinkomanFan> No, go back and read it again :|
<Ictiv> Soreness/Dryness, either one*
<Phase4> Ictiv: no, tiredness. unless thats what you meen
<Phase4> ots 00:52 here
<Meanwhile> You cried because you got a glass chess set.
<Gumri> I can read that you sold it for $8 but that it is.
<Meanwhile> That's...you know I can see why people ignored it.
<Phase4> + 19.90 shipping
<Phase4> seems legit
<StinkomanFan> I thought it was a Video game console!
<Ictiv> StinkomanFan: It was a d'awww story
<StinkomanFan> And I was 8
<Meanwhile> I can see how that'd be disappointing for someone who doesn't like chess.
<StinkomanFan> *11
<Jim> Leave Rarity alone :o
<Starflash> Meanwhile so you liek chess?
<Phase4> are we going to stay on veemi for the new episode or switch to livestream?
<Meanwhile> Rarity is best marshmallow.
<StinkomanFan> Jim never leaves Rarity alone at home...
<Meanwhile> I do like chess Starflash.
<Big_Jakeintosh> dramatic rarity is best pony
<Starflash> cool :3

<Gumri> Do you remember the fanfic 'a'
<Phase4> Gumri: such an epic
<Meanwhile> A non outside link would be a link to a bronystate page.
<StinkomanFan> I loved it
<Meanwhile> Technically.
<Gumri> It was just a Gdoc saying 'a' Well silly
<Meanwhile> But why you'd do that when everyone probably has the page open anyway...
<StinkomanFan> "I laughed, I cried, It moved me Bob."
<Meanwhile> Ah yes, Prince Doucheblood.
<Phase4> ^
<Gumri> Rarity is well funny there
<StinkomanFan> Prince Blueblood's first name is Vladimire according to some comics

<Phase4> Dken2021: theres more than one fanfic, more than one bit of music too
<Dken2021> was leaning more on the music
<Gumri> I just realised that quite a few ponies don't have names
<StinkomanFan> DJ P0N-3 and DJ Shadow go into a musical duel, would the world survive the epic?
<Meanwhile> Dj who?

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Interesting, have you tried closing other windows and applications to see if it's just your computer causing the lag?
<Meanwhile> They kill ya slowly.
<Meanwhile> Like watching the Twilight movies.
<derp> there aren't any other windows open
<Jim> ^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02If that doesn't help, you can always check to make sure nothing else is using up your internet as internet speed can cause lag.
<StinkomanFan> How about Octavia and Beet-hoof-en have a musical collab
<Dken2021> to be fair, the first one was tolerable, never seen the other movies
<Big_Jakeintosh> I tried smoking cigarettes once made me sick puked my guts out never touching em again
<Phase4> awesome, multigigabit wireless is in development
<Meanwhile> Be more bold, kidnap your target friends.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You can also try using a different browser to see if that helps. Also, you can try clearing your cache.

<Dken2021> anyone mind linking the current stream to me? stuck on livestream atm
<emangamer> Gumri: if you ask me the newest episode was mor forced, because we have had enough episodes of RD being prideful and it was rather unorigional
<Jim> I've got the same problem as you Dken2021
<Meanwhile> Too much sparkle.
*emangamer hugs SuperBrony64 "Can I sleep on your flank?"

<WRITEity> Meanwhile: inb4 She futzes up the timeline be freezing herself with the Orb of Tornami

<emangamer> bon bon sounds really weird
<StinkomanFan> Berry Puch quit drinking 7 times this week
<Meanwhile> Berry Punch picked the wrong week to quit drinking.

<emangamer> StinkomanFan: why is it so hard to stop drinking juice?
<Yahooz> wow, muted main channel o_o

*Jim pats hugs emangamer "There there"
<Ictiv> emangamer: Would a hug be okay?
<StinkomanFan> Double the fun!
<Meanwhile> Having good friends makes you sad emangamer?
<LordDerpington> So who's going to be the first to make ponies out of that stuff?
<Phase4> 'floam' reminds me of the first mlp movie
<Gumri> WillyWonka talks so silly
<LordCelestia> 0,5So guys

*Ictiv hugs emangamer back.
<Dermathil> I can't have fun without the main chat
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh

<LordCelestia> 0,5Room system
<Luna> 07,01just some small changes :)
<Yahooz> Still a new system
*emangamer hugs Luna "Where did you come from?"
<StinkomanFan> It's only for a week
<SuperBrony64> 10,02If you aren't seeing a stream, please refresh/clear you cache of your browser. You should be seeing a Livestream embed.
<WRITEity> it's pretty simple to fix this Twilight. Simply suggest that Rarity and FLuttershy talk out their issues.
*Luna 07,01is always here
<Yahooz> emangamer: she lurks EVERYWHERE
<fluttercry> 05,15I know right #bronystate is so well behaved
<Phase4> dat laugh track
<Meanwhile> I only use this room during manestreams anyway so I'm not really noticing much difference.
<Tovler|Hungover> the 6 rooms are just full of strangers.
<Yahooz> fluttercry: I wonder why? XD
<emangamer> Meanwhile: IKR?
<Dermathil> FINALLY someone made a message to say that if you don't see stream you need to refresh.
<StinkomanFan> I miss Veerez
<Phase4> ^
*Luna 07,01hugs Dermathil
<Gumri> I like watching Twilight clop.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i dunno about that i saw someone running nakid in main chat
*Dermathil hugs Luna back.
<Phase4> StinkomanFan: he's been taken offline, guy who made him got sick of maintaining python
<LordCelestia> 0,5Dermathil
*Meanwhile breezeblocks Gumri.
<Dermathil> What?
<emangamer> Ohai Dermathil
<LordCelestia> 0,5A lot of the rooms have been saying to refresh
<Yahooz> This room needs to be used more often :p
<LordCelestia> 0,5Quite repeatedly
<Gumri> As in claping Meanwhile. DIRTY BOY!
<Dermathil> LC, I was in pinkie pie and was never told to refresh until I asked a mod
<Yahooz> XD
<Phase4> good music in this series
<StinkomanFan> I tried to tell him that be he wouldn't listen :|
<Yahooz> I never refreshed period
<Everlasting_Joy> Yahooz, only buy regulars though.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Well then, I dont know who is in Pinkie Pie
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm in Pinkie Pie LC
<Meanwhile> Who isn't in Pinkie Pie...
<Yahooz> Everlasting_Joy: Ofc

<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie is in all of us
<Everlasting_Joy> Bark bark bark.
<Phase4> dat chat derp
<Yahooz> as opposed to screaming LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG
<Luna> 07,01true LC

<HeavyMetalDash> lol

<Luna> 07,01hey we always have somepony streaming *coughs*

<Tovler|Hungover> I say I say bravo, son.
<Dken2021> Luna the auto streamer?
<FlutterMoist> alright, what were the last two ep that played?
<Meanwhile> Dem sheeple.
<HeavyMetalDash> sheep play follow the leader
<Dermathil> LC, when it forces the chat to ALSO refresh then it isn't worth it until explicit orders.
<Big_Jakeintosh> I <3 my reload stream button cant remember where i got it
<Phase4> and twi's like 'lolwut'
<Meanwhile> Dermathil: use the IRC popout.
<Yahooz> alright im going to check out Dash channel. Wish me luck XD
<LordCelestia> 0,5^
<Gumri> Then the world exploded
<LordCelestia> 0,5IRC popout or an actual IRC client

<Everlasting_Joy> Yahooz you have our support.
<StinkomanFan> Sheeple remind me of that terrible car commercial

<emansickness> I'm so tired of being sick...
<FlutterMoist> which ep played before this one?
<Everlasting_Joy> Brb.
<Phase4> Big_Jakeintosh: best bit of code i ever wrote

<Dermathil> Meanwhile, LC, takes too long. I'm well known for being lazy.
<Yahooz> Holy fu-
<Jim> The grand gala was before, FlutterMoist
<Meanwhile> Dermathil: well then that's your problem.
<Big_Jakeintosh> Phase4: yeah that sounds right good sir ;)
<Yahooz> So much raging all caps
<Dermathil> I ONLY open the popout when I go fullscreen
<StinkomanFan> Gumri:Twice!
<FlutterMoist> thank you Jim
<Gumri> Wha?
<StinkomanFan> f gimme a moment
<HeavyMetalDash> I can't keep up with the dash channel going to fast
<Randomnerd> Jesus christ, it's nuts out there.
<Jim> "After all this time?" "Always"
<HeavyMetalDash> but my WPM is attrocious
<Big_Jakeintosh> this is the only channel i can ever keep up with on saturdays
<Gumri> ^

<emansickness> alright everypony ready for #1?
<LordDerpington> Oh yes, called it. Luna Eclipsed.
<Phase4> lol, this episode again
<Tovler|Hungover> only 9 favorites?
<Meanwhile> Iiiiit's Luna Eclipsed. Didn't see that coming.
<Dermathil> Ack
<Dermathil> We saw it yesterday!!!!
<Lucid> And Twi channel is moving REALLY fast
<Dken2021> and it ends with luna eclipe? sure, why not?
<fluttercry> 05,15....no winter wrap up?
<Gumri> How did this ssilly episode get it!
<FlutterMoist> both BMN eps aired in the marathon
<Phase4> so both episodes we saw during the bmn are in this list
<fluttercry> 05,15Really?
<HeavyMetalDash> so id the Dash channel
<Kammerjunk> I approve of this episode.
<StinkomanFan> Errypony wubs woona
<Big_Jakeintosh> I expected lesson zero thats is my personal fave
<Phase4> fluttercry: no winter wrap up :'(
<emansickness> fluttercry: was there party of one?
<Meanwhile> Disappoint amirite fluttercry.
<Davie_Jones> People love Luna
<Kammerjunk> This episode might even be my favourite.
<Davie_Jones> I love luna
<Gumri> ugh
<Meanwhile> There was emansickness
<fluttercry> 05,15I am VERY disappoint
<Yahooz> I think their doing it by vote?
<Dken2021> I as well
<FlutterMoist> I expected Sonic Rainboom or Winter Wrap Up
<Purple`Prose> Luna is best pony, apparently
<fluttercry> 05,15and emansickness there was
<Davie_Jones> Granny sounds like my granny.
<StinkomanFan> I voted for Winter Wrap up fluttercry
<Gumri> I am very disappont also
<LordDerpington> Yeah, Party of One was back at no. 5 or so.
<Randomnerd> Hub! Why u no like us?
<Meanwhile> Grannies all sound the same to me.
<emansickness> FUN FACT: amniomorphic spell actually means something, but it's a rather long explaniation
<Yahooz> WWU was also before Green Isnt your color
<StinkomanFan> My Granny's dead :c
<WRITEity> http://bit.ly/yKJoK6
<Tovler|Hungover> This is probably my 32nd favorite episode.
<Gumri> Was there a sonic rainboom?
<Davie_Jones> What sorta accent does that little colt have?
<emansickness> hmm...thats rather weird
<LordDerpington> No Sonic Rainboom.
<Dken2021> yorkshire?
<Dken2021> idk
<emansickness> sonic rainboom isn't even that good
<HeavyMetalDash> that was a FUN FACT <3
<Everlasting_Joy> Ha! I called it!
<Tovler|Hungover> Green Isn't Your Color was one of the top favorite episodes?
<Lucid> Amniomorphic basically means creating ceramics. Which makes Starswirl a hairy potter
<Randomnerd> ^
<Lucid> Just sayin'
<emansickness> Lucid: no it doesnt
<Yahooz> power up the frenz train!
<NullRadix> I'll simply note that my Chat has remained active and still scrolling for... about 15 hours now, for a new record
<emansickness> Lucid: not even close
<Lucid> That's what I read
<StinkomanFan> I thought it involved the forming of the fetus
<WRITEity> http://bit.ly/z98MyZ
*Davie_Jones beats Lucid with a book of bad puns
<emansickness> Lucid: someone was trolling you
<Yahooz> freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenz
<Yahooz> ; d
<Gumri> france!
<Dken2021> france --d'oh
<Phase4> 2k viewers
<Lucid> It's possible, actually it's probable
<Phase4> 30 min til episode
<Tovler|Hungover> traaaaaaaaaaance
<HeavyMetalDash> huzzah!
<Gumri> At least it is no shortcake today
<HeavyMetalDash> ^
<Phase4> ^
<WRITEity> Gumri: inb4 instead of today's ep, we get Shortcake
<Yahooz> I love how we get 2k viewers despite no new episode
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Gumri> oh god please no
<StinkomanFan> Those kids are more well off then 99% of the world
<emansickness> Lucid: amnio actually is a base that comes from another word having to do with embrios
<Davie_Jones> I found Starswirl: http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/299/7/5/star_swirl_the_bearded_by_metrukuta-d4dzlck.png
*Tovler|Hungover actually watches Strawberry Shortcake on the Hubworld website
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Rainbow_dubbles> i'm a little confused when does the new episode start?
<HeavyMetalDash> soon
<LordDerpington> Another half hour, Rainbow_dubbles
<Gumri> After this Rainbow_dubbles
<Phase4> i like how i posted one link and got told, then people are posting images for the rest of the stream :P
<LordDerpington> Well, 27 mins.
<emansickness> Rainbow_dubbles: 1030
<Lucid> If that's true, then what the hell is Starswirl supposed to have invented?
<StinkomanFan> Luna sounded depressed when she named Twilight Sparkle's costume :s
<Meanwhile> Image links are only links allowed during stream.
<Randomnerd> From Latin for "membrane around a fetus", from Greek "bowl in which the blood of victims was caught", from ame, (bucket)
<Rainbow_dubbles> oh i see thanks
<LordDerpington> "Amniomorphic spell" - something used in conception or childbirth, I'd guess.
<emansickness> thats really weird
<Meanwhile> And only when they're relevant.
<Phase4> Lucid: the 'ambimorphic' spell or something like that
<Phase4> Lucid: its magic, i aint gota explain shit
<Randomnerd> Womb is compared to a bowl, becuase Romans are weird like that.
<StinkomanFan> He forms babbies
<Tovler|Hungover> Star-Swirl invented the Traffic Light and Peanut Oil /blackhistoryfact
<HeavyMetalDash> exactly
<WRITEity> http://bit.ly/xylhu8
<Randomnerd> ^hehe
<Phase4> derpy <3
<Dken2021> does she shoot muffins?
<StinkomanFan> Starswirl forms babbies
<LordDerpington> New clip!
<Phase4> STREAM! Y U SPOILER
<Yahooz> STREAM HAS SPOILERS
<Yahooz> BAN IT
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<Dken2021> or old for those who watched the leak
<Yahooz> oh wait
<LordDerpington> Big Mac laughs! Film at 11!
<StinkomanFan> Big Mac gets all the mares
<Yahooz> I watched the ep already XD
<Yahooz> its epic
*Randomnerd would join that group
<Davie_Jones> Star Swirl was one who formed 200 Omniamorphic spells. Omniamorphic means "all-encompassing shapeless spell"
<WRITEity> http://bit.ly/yrd7Yz
<HeavyMetalDash> as have I
<StinkomanFan> Who IS that ghost poni?
*Everlasting_Joy would join Randomnerd in that group.
<Davie_Jones> So they are 200 multitasking spells that have no solid form.
<LordDerpington> It's Berry Punch's colouring.
<emansickness> Davie_Jones: its actually an "amniomorphic"\
<StinkomanFan> *AmniO
<HeavyMetalDash> rainbow dash is best shadowbolt
<Yahooz> dat shadowbolt
<Phase4> after the leak we still have 2064 viewers 30min before the episode
<Davie_Jones> amniomorphic means lamb-shape spell
<Phase4> nvm, 2058
<Everlasting_Joy> Diabeetus is a serious problems.
<StinkomanFan> Spike died a horrible death and RD was arrested for manslaughter
<Yahooz> ...because she just isnt a wonderbolt yet
<emansickness> Davie_Jones: no, not even close
<Davie_Jones> Do you really prefer that over Omniamorphic?
<Gumri> I saw the leak but i want to watch it with a chat
<Davie_Jones> It's from the wiki.

<LordDerpington> CBF
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> why was the water green?
<HeavyMetalDash> because magic
<WRITEity> because why not?
<StinkomanFan> Starswirl has preggo fe- OOH ZECORA
<Randomnerd> Conspiracy Keanu.
<Meanwhile> Apparently amnio is bowl and morphic is morph. So...Master of the potting spell?
<LordDerpington> Makes the game harder.
<Dken2021> apple bobbing water isn't that hygenic tbh
<Phase4> LordDerpington: the game
<Randomnerd> Hairy Potter.
<Phase4> allso hi
<Gumri> i'll be back when the new ep is on. If you need me for some silly reason you can ping me.

<emansickness> Davie_Jones: look up amniotic fluid
<WRITEity> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/1ca151ff-885c-4ead-ba81-c4061d3dac63.jpg
<Randomnerd> I really don't see why people hate the stupid joke so much.
<Yahooz> indeed WRITEity
<Davie_Jones> Yes, Amino means the membrane around the fetus.
<Lucid> I'm just going to go with my headcanon that amnio means bowl in Equestria and call it a day
<Randomnerd> It also means Bowl.
<Davie_Jones> You really want him to be a sage in pregency spells?
<Davie_Jones> I didn't see that, RN
<Davie_Jones> Can you cite a source?
<Krakass> And that's how ponies are made.
<Randomnerd> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amnion
<emansickness> Davie_Jones: exactly, so it's a spell (I believe) that can be used to change ponies physical appearences. i.e. coat color
<Meanwhile> Personally I'm content to let him be a Hairy Potter.
<Yahooz> and then half the fan base came
<emansickness> Davie_Jones: while they are still in the woomb
<Davie_Jones> Can you cite a source, eman?
<emansickness> https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=amnio#sclient=psy-ab&hl=en&safe=off&source=hp&q=define:amnion&pbx=1&oq=define:amnion&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=5974l6916l11l7110l7l1l6l0l0l0l72l72l1l7l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&fp=990b2c255be26274&biw=1366&bih=643
<StinkomanFan> I came when Zecora started talking
<emansickness> oh god....
<Lucid> Same here Meanwhile
<Yahooz> WHATDAFUQ LINK
<Meanwhile> Dat google search.
<Davie_Jones> So Star Swirl wrote spells for capturing blood in bowls?
<Phase4> emansickness: dat link
<emansickness> Davie_Jones: http://derpy.me/bpkrB
<LordDerpington> Zecora is rapidly becoming my favourite minor character.
<Everlasting_Joy> LordDerpington she's already mine :).
<EpicStatsGuy> Murrrnapples :3
<Yahooz> Wait
<Randomnerd> Oh for fuck's sake, fine.
<Yahooz> 45 USERS!
<Meanwhile> Can we not just agree that Starswirl is a hairy potter and leave him be?
<Yahooz> woah
<WRITEity> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-oh-most-wonderful-of-nights.png
<Randomnerd> Starswirl makes Babies.
<StinkomanFan> I wanna meet a person like Zecora
<HeavyMetalDash> that's because talking in ryme is boss
<Randomnerd> I don't give a shit anymore.
<Davie_Jones> so Star Swirl wote spells for the membrane during pregancies?
<Meanwhile> Starswirl is too old for this shit.
<HeavyMetalDash> excuse my spelling
<Lucid> Again, I'm just going with my headcanon here
<Phase4> WRITEity: that pics awesoem
<StinkomanFan> Starswirl was a PIMP
<emansickness> Davie_Jones: obviously you can't use the EXACT meaning of the word because that makes no sense. thats why I think the spell can be used to decide ponies coat color while they are in the womb
<StinkomanFan> Big Mac's descended from him
<Davie_Jones> See, I could go all day with this until you agree that it isn't aninomorphic.
<Everlasting_Joy> Funky floam shapes.
<LordDerpington> My headcanon is that Starswirl was responsible for the birth of Celestia and Luna. He changed them in the womb.
<StinkomanFan> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Yahooz> dat black hasbro month
<Davie_Jones> Then why doesn't it use a word for color?
<Davie_Jones> or coat?
<Dken2021> who is that black cartoon guy?
<Phase4> i'm prety sure there was a 'b' when twi was talking about starswirls spell
<emansickness> LordDerpington: that makes sense
<Meanwhile> emansickness: is it not nicer to think that he was fond of pottery as hobby?
<StinkomanFan> >YFW the Challenger exploded
<emansickness> Davie_Jones: because magic *snort snort*
<Davie_Jones> Adn he got a shelf for that?
<LordDerpington> Three years later though.
<Tovler|Hungover> I love it when I have Phlegm in the back of my throat. It causes me to loud bass in my voice.
<WRITEity> StinkomanFan: that's what I was thinking.
<Yahooz> and then half the fan base came... again
<Lucid> And I don't think that the writers would just pull a random word out of a medical dictionary
<Meanwhile> Thanks for sharing Tovler|Hungover.
<emansickness> Meanwhile: I still dont see how you can get from amniomorphic to pottery
<StinkomanFan> Luna won't you cry for me
<LordDerpington> Etymology
<Davie_Jones> Nether do I. That's why I think they didn't use that word.
<Randomnerd> Fuck it.
<Davie_Jones> And this is where the episode gets annoyhing for me.
<emansickness> shes...BEAUTIFUL. Luna you are really pretty tonight
<StinkomanFan> Nopony likes Latin anyway
<Meanwhile> emansickness: amnio is a word for bowl in greek.
<WRITEity> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-new-episode.jpg
<Jim> so true WRITEity
<Randomnerd> Starswirl makes babies, okay? Let's go with that, I don't give a shit anymore. I'm arguing on the fucking internet now.
<Kammerjunk> feeaaat
<Davie_Jones> A word for the bowl taht catches BLOOD
<Lucid> Well, I don't think that they would choose that word without a reason
<StinkomanFan> Bowl made from the blood of your enemies
<Meanwhile> Irrelevant, still a bowl.
<Randomnerd> Tabitha's awesome as this voice.
<Lucid> That is a badass bowl
<Davie_Jones> Yes.. but a bowl for catching BLOOD
<HeavyMetalDash> that bowl is soo metal
<Davie_Jones> You really think they'd make that mistake?
<WRITEity> Tabitha's awesome in general.
<Lucid> And? It's still a bowl
<Meanwhile> you really think 12 year olds would know what that is?
<Randomnerd> I wish Rarity was in the episode too. but I appreciate the theory that Rarity is exhausted.
<Lucid> I think that knowing that we would look into pretty much anything, I don't think they would have gone with something so squicky
<StinkomanFan> Prince Vladimire Blueblood uses an amnion
<Meanwhile> No 12 year old ever sat down and wanted to know what amniomorphic meant.
<Davie_Jones> I think she was in bed sick at all the bad costums.
<Lucid> But us bronies would
<Meanwhile> Exactly.
<WRITEity> I feel like we could have had that Rarity scene they had written, if they had just cut Pip out of the equation.
<Meanwhile> Which is the probable point of the Hairy Potter joke.
<Big_Jakeintosh> my theory for why luna's hair changed is that she was weak after being in the moon for so long and it took a while for her powers to come back
<emansickness> WRITEity: what scene?
<Lucid> They wouldn't have called it that without a reason
<WRITEity> emansickness: there was originally a rarity scene in this eps script, but it was cut for time.
<Tovler|Hungover> I'm surprised the Rarity scene wasn't kept due to Hasbro's love for pink ponies.
<emansickness> WRITEity: and you know this...how?
<StinkomanFan> No seriously, Vlad (The Impaler) Blueblood
<Dken2021> rarity scene?
<Phase4> how bout "amniamorphic", a fic i read had that spelling
<Lucid> And knowing their love for jokes of that sort, it wouldn't surprise me if that was what happened
<StinkomanFan> How AWESOME would that be?
<Davie_Jones> What does amnia mean?
<Everlasting_Joy> I'd love it if when they release the DVD of this show, they include deleted scenes and what not.
<Davie_Jones> *amnia-
<WRITEity> emansickness: it was posted on EQD from the Deviant art of one of the people who works on the show
<Phase4> "Amiina (formerly Amína and Aníma) is an Icelandic musical quartet"
<Phase4> i assume thats not it
<Jim> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled2.gif
<LordDerpington> Plus the design of the dress Luna was supposed to wear in that scene made it into the Castle Creator game.
<Everlasting_Joy> WRITEity Lauren Faust herself told us of the deleted scene.
<Phase4> Jim: thats awesome xD
<emansickness> here is ANOTHER theory. they picked a random sylloble that sounded magic hense amniomorphic spell PERFECT argument over *runs into a door*
<Lucid> It would be nice to get Lauren Faust's opinion about that
<StinkomanFan> In my headcanon Rarity is a vampire
<Lucid> Eman, I don't think that'sthe way it happened. There are so many other prefixes that they could have chosen.
<Meanwhile> amnia, plural of amnion, the innermost membrane of the sac enclosing the embryo of a mammal, reptile, or bird: it is filled with watery fluid.
<Davie_Jones> Well seeing as Lauren is only a consulting producer, I don't think we should bother her much about the show.
<WRITEity> well, she WAS apparently meant to be dressed as Vampira, Starflash
<WRITEity> er, StinkomanFan
<Davie_Jones> Come next season, I question if she will even be part any further.
<Starflash> Ohai WRITEity
<Randomnerd> Sigh.
<StinkomanFan> And Sweetie Belle was dressed as Dracula
<Tovler|Hungover> Lauen is completely done with the show now
<Phase4> "Star Swirl the bearded and the amniomorphic spell is really a subtle﻿ joke: Amnio=Bowl Morphic=Morph ; He is a bearded wizard who shapes bowls, a Hairy Potter." Solution from a youtube comment
<StinkomanFan> ...or Blackula
<Meanwhile> We had that already Phase4 but for some reason the debate continued.
<Davie_Jones> A youtube comment?
<emansickness> Phase4: because youtube is TOTALLY relyable right?
<StinkomanFan> FUNFUNFUNFUN
<Davie_Jones> Taht's your source, Phase?
<Meanwhile> Because anything you've cited IS reliable?
<Phase4> emansickness: naturaly
<StinkomanFan> Looking forward to the weekend
<Meanwhile> Wikipedia is hardly untamperable.
<Jim> dat fun has been doubled spam in chats
<emansickness> inb4 the fun has been doubled
<Davie_Jones> Thus was born a meme
<Everlasting_Joy> Dinky Doo <3.
<emansickness> you TOTALLY adress a princess by her first name. thats proper right
<Davie_Jones> Dinky Doo? Where?
<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie was a bitch this episode
<Meanwhile> Afaik that's her only name.
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<HeavyMetalDash> this is the best idea evah!
<Purple`Prose> I'm summoning the spiders. They'll come at my call!
<Everlasting_Joy> emansickness but she told them to, so it's fair enough.
<StinkomanFan> Spiderses
<Davie_Jones> I'm gong to stop watching now
<Purple`Prose> Because I'm spidermare!
<emansickness> StinkomanFan: not really, shes just trying to have a laugh
<Randomnerd> Kil the Loyalists!
<Phase4> ohai Purple`Prose
*Randomnerd kills the loyalists
<StinkomanFan> Because total mayhem and destruction is worth a good laugh
<Kammerjunk> All shall love me and despair!
<Jim> That shouting...it's making people nervous.
<Randomnerd> WORSHIP HER!
<Purple`Prose> cue the Galadrial
<StinkomanFan> Also breaking the goddess of the night
<emansickness> StinkomanFan: that wasnt the direct resut of pinkie. that was luna over reacting
<Ictiv> StinkomanFan: In a world where cartoon violence is the only violence... maybe
<Big_Jakeintosh> I would worship her
<emansickness> she looks toatally badass
<Tovler|Hungover> omg, cliffhanger
*Randomnerd stops killing Loyalists.
<emansickness> I feel bad for Luna (the mod) she must be getting pinged so much right now
<LordCelestia> 0,5IKR
<Meanwhile> Like a table tennis match no doubt.
<Davie_Jones> I don't think she'd want you worshiping her after you wet yourself from fear.
*Ictiv uses magic to revive ALL THE LOYALISTS!
<StinkomanFan> No srsly, Pinkie kept going even AFTER Twilight asked her to stop
<Tovler|Hungover> She could have been Lulu.
<WRITEity> Im guessing Luna decided to muter her computer for this ep.
<emansickness> StinkomanFan: its pinkie...get over it
<Lucid> One of the upcoming episodes involves time travel, right? Two words: Doctor Whooves
<StinkomanFan> And RD decided to SCREW EVERYTHING UP
<emansickness> Lucid: spoiler? IDK'
<StinkomanFan> Spoilers Lucid
<Randomnerd> Lucid : Oh GOd, that would be great :)
<Phase4> has anyone here read the rd travels through time fic?
<Big_Jakeintosh> ep20 is gonna be epic
<Phase4> it was a mindfuck
<Meanwhile> RD screwing things up? nah.
<Dken2021> spoiler? it's a synopsis, not much to spoil
<Randomnerd> Giant Robots?! Bah. Gay.
<emansickness> SHUT UP about episode 20. I dont wanna hear it
<Everlasting_Joy> Ep20 is going to up the flood gates for fannon and cannon.
<StinkomanFan> It still counts according to SB64
<Phase4> Randomnerd: ikr, its all about ponies now
<Ictiv> Or Emmet Frown...
<Ictiv> Brown*
<Meanwhile> The synopsis counts as a spoiler in chat.
<HeavyMetalDash> ponies=MANLY
<Lucid> Though, the one thing I would die to see is a River Song pony. Spoilers
<Dken2021> well for you, no more talk about it then
*Dermathil is gonna watch the episode then leave when it is done.
<Meanwhile> Link the synopsis either privately or at a time when outside links are acceptable.
<WRITEity> River Sogn pony? NO THANK YOU
<emansickness> SHUT UP WITH THE GDO DAMN SPOILERS
<Ictiv> Somehow every type I misstype something i end up spelling somethingthat also makes sense
<emansickness> JUST SHUT UP
<Randomnerd> Lecture her!

<Meanwhile> emansickness: take a chill pill.
<StinkomanFan> Doctor Whoof would not be happy with this chat

<Davie_Jones> Pinky was wall eyed there for a moment.

<Davie_Jones> What movies was he in?
<Tovler|Hungover> they dubbed his voice acting…. Whaaat?
<Dermathil> Isn't Zack Efron the guy from high school musical?
<Meanwhile> Zack Effron...
<RAWRity> Davie_Jones: he was in those High School musical movies
<emansickness> that movie looks so stupid
<Kammerjunk> Davie_Jones: The guy in High School Musical.

<Dermathil> BTW, it looks like the viewer numbers are HALF what they usually are.
*HeavyMetalDash has seen episode but waits too see everyponies reaction

<Phase4> Everlasting_Joy: thats good enough for me ^_^
<Meanwhile> Big_Jakeintosh: never going to be canon. U jelly?

<emansickness> RAWRity: and?
<Lucid> Dermathil, why?
<Phase4> ran ran ru!
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: Yet again proving that Team Faust has balls.
<Dermathil> Lucid: he loves Caramel.

<Davie_Jones> Ok. Lets take bets. I have ten dollars on ten mins until the entire plan goes wrong.
<emansickness> Kammerjunk: FORMALLY team faust
<Davie_Jones> Any takers?
<Everlasting_Joy> Kammerjunck I agree.
<Dermathil> Rawrity: I saw it as a pony doing a lecture on an academical subject. Did I miss something?
<StinkomanFan> Blueblood had a cold in that song
<Phase4> Davie_Jones: i put 10 on 15
<RAWRity> Davie_Jones: I'm goonna say...10 seconds.
<Meanwhile> Dermathil: the coffin in the background.
<Randomnerd> They practice Coltvinism
<emansickness> StinkomanFan: no that was somepony else
<Kammerjunk> emansickness: Yeah, but The Team Formerly Known as Team Faust is too long. TFKTF, maybe.
<Dermathil> Meanwhile: oh. I didn't see it.
<StinkomanFan> It looks like them
<Lucid> Davie_Jones, I have twenty on something involving tree sap
<StinkomanFan> ..why was there Lava in the middle of a city?

<emansickness> StinkomanFan: blueblood was the one that was too fancy
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: I said that same thing like 3 hours ago.

<Gumri> They are still advertizing wuggles?
<Tovler|Hungover> I still don't know what a Wuggle is
<RAWRity> I wonder is a kid has ever overstuffed their wuggle and made it burst?
<Meanwhile> A wuggle is the skin of an animal that you must fill with stuffing in order to make sure its soul doesn't escape.
<Davie_Jones> and/or forced to go to pony church.
<Randomnerd> Ugh, how cloying and... Unicorns?! I'll take seven.

<Jim> I didn't bump into any spoilers before the episode
<Phase4> only spoiler i saw was that jelly pic. but i assumed that was fanwork
<Randomnerd> Or Coltvinist, or Equuscopalian!
<LordDerpington> DHX Media, wasn't it?

<HeavyMetalDash> indeed

<TOY_PON32> No...I hate sleep
<Kammerjunk> Wait, is this tune what I think it is?
<Big_Jakeintosh> anything featuring the cmc is good in my book of course now we need a scootaloo centric epiosde
<Tovler|Hungover> I watched it early. I thought it was fitting that I'd watch the Valentines Day episode alone.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14great ep, would watch again and again
<fluttercry> 05,15i wish I knew what this song was
<HeavyMetalDash> for a thousand years!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We appreciate everyone coming.
<Dermathil> Meanwhile: they said they'd unmute it right after it was done. This is one of the reasons I didn't want it to happen.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd say that it was all worth it.

<Randomnerd> I can't stop listening to this song....
<Lucid> And, I'm back
<Owfin> Really?

<Nafedude> Was that the pic he drew last week?
<Owfin> *checks wiki*
<Pale_Horse> <Stewie head tilt>
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm too scared to ask for the pony toys at mcdonalds
<Solar_Pony> No RD or FS or Rarity either
<K_A> Shipping pic? XD
<Jim> cherilee I guess
<Kammerjunk> fluttercry: Don't be!
<Kammerjunk> It's McDonalds. They're used to weirdos.
<Meanwhile> At least you have the opportunity fluttercry
<anon> with big mac?
<NullRadix> I'm too scared to eat at McDonalds
<Owfin> I muted the music here because I prefer You Gotta Glitch.
<Poundcake> nooooo
<Poundcake> i missed it
<Big_Jakeintosh> I am not ashamed to go to mcdonalds and ask por ponies
<Poundcake> :(
<kirzstryfe> 1,3what, no 80's version Wrek? ;)
<Big_Jakeintosh> I where my pony shirts abnd hoodie with pride
<Kammerjunk> NullRadix: I'm just scared of Ronald McDonalds.
<Ziltoidian> Wrek is drawing cherilee like one of his french mares
<Onyxiaz> awesome painting :)
<Nafedude> I HOPE WE- screw it.
<Kammerjunk> Big_Jakeintosh: Ditto, except just shirts.
<Pale_Horse> It was awesome. the Reapers attacked Equestria and everyone was getting turend into pony paste to make a Pony Reaper.
<Kammerjunk> I get a few stares, but most people ignore it.
<Big_Jakeintosh> Kammerjunk: I got a Derpy hoodie and i loves it
<K_A> > Windows
<K_A> > Not using FB2K
<Luna> 07,01Wrek check PM's
<Meanwhile> Legit fear Kammerjunk. A Ronald Mcdonald in a city about 40 minutes away from me once went insane on the job and dangled a kid over a deep fat fryer.
<Jim> so much pony music
<Solar_Pony> Thats a lot of pony music
<Owfin> Applejack wasn't in Stare Master! Which was also episode 17 in its own season. The number 17 is just bad for Applejack!
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Dude, what.
<fluttercry> 05,15I'll wear a shirt, or use a pony bag, but I just can't bring myself to ask for the toys
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'd be the same way
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but
<Meanwhile> I'm lying, things like that only happen in America.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14since the toys are coming out in march
<Nafedude> well by guys
<PinkiePeett> eurobeat find a pet mix plzzz
<Jim> Just bring ut up casually, like "Oh, by the way do you have the pony toys?"
<Big_Jakeintosh> I got a compliment form a girl at the bookstore the other day for my pony shirt but then she said "yeah its really manly"and then I was confused
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think I'll try to get the Twilight toy for my birthday
<EDXL> derp?
<Meanwhile> Ask like you don't really know what they are and tell them your niece adores them.
<HeavyMetalDash> I need to complete my mane 6 collection yet
<mario_pony> bye Nafedude!!
<Meanwhile> That's how I'd roll.
<unfoundbug> Scoot-Scootaloo why were you asking about xbox earler?
<fluttercry> 05,15also they usually only have 1 toy at a time, so I'll end up getting duplicates
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14essentially, the plan for my b-day is
<Kammerjunk> I wore my shirt all the way through the gymnasium I'm going to attend.
<Kammerjunk> Felt good.
<Meanwhile> They usually sell the toys by themselves for like, a quid if you ask.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Wake up, new pony ep (if there is one), go to McD's for pony toy
<Big_Jakeintosh> The day derpy became canon I went Wal-mart and bought the Blin Basg mane 6 toys not one fuck was givin
<Pale_Horse> Listening to music like this makes me wanna listen to more Two-Mix.
<Meanwhile> You don't even need to buy a happy meal if you just ask for the toys.
<anon> So what does he use to draw this?
<Big_Jakeintosh> gawd my typing is crap 2day
<SaxyPretender> 0,14run around the house like a giddy child
<Golakka> Is this wrek thats drawing?
<Kazahana> Pale_Horse *brohoof*
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender is best manchild.
<Pale_Horse> *brohoof* :D
<Kazahana> I don't run into Two-Mix fans like, ever, lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Indeed
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Kazahana> Early 90's Japanese music scene ftw
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It helps that I don't quite look 20 XD
<Big_Jakeintosh> so though the only toys I have are the little miniatures but I want more
<Meanwhile> I think that black pudding earlier is disagreeing with the fried mushrooms...
<Golakka> Play "Running in the 90s" :p
<HeavyMetalDash> I got mc'ds toys and a rainbow dash currently
<Meanwhile> Oh that reminds me, do you get black pudding in America?
<Randomnerd> Nope
<fluttercry> 05,15nope
<Meanwhile> Well that sucks.
*Ictiv notices that firefox crash stopped any sound inside firefox from playing... Great. I'll be back after a full restart.
<PinkiePeett> Europet mix please :)
<Chaospony> This isn't an open request radio stream...
<Meanwhile> It's something I figured you'd have because of what it is.
<fluttercry> 05,15Well actually, we do have blood sasuage, but it's expensive and rare
<PinkiePeett> although this one is pretty epic too
<canman512> ^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It's delicious though
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Naptime for me! See you guys in a few hours!

<Meanwhile> How can you have a full monty without black pudding. Madness.
<RaveBrony> When the new episode was on?
<fluttercry> 05,15Well they're rare down here. I'd expect New York to have it
<Solar_Pony> Good night all
<Sumica> 00,10Well hope you all enjoyed the marathon and new ep. My bed seem to be trying to float off so I am gonna go hold it down for a few hours

<Chaospony> Het eman
<Kazahana> CHEERILEE. :D
<Chaospony> heey*
<Sumica> 00,10ah man wrek why did you have to draw, you know I love to watch you draw
<unfoundbug> http://imgur.com/afxiG
<Pezz> Ponies are actually really easy to draw, and fun too :D
<otakon> ARGH!?
<pony_19> helo world
<otakon> I overslept
<Meanwhile> You missed it.
<Jim> True, unfoundbug
<Meanwhile> You missed it hard.
<otakon> what I miss?
<Meanwhile> Everything.
<Jim> oh my D:
<NovaMarcellus> Lol im actually drawing one now
<Big_Jakeintosh> what program are program are they using to draw I wanna try my hand at some this stuff
<Lucid> Maybe, but I can't draw worth crap
<Jim> You need to watch the new episode otakon
<Meanwhile> The mareathon, the episode, whatever else there was.
<Meanwhile> You missed it all.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Adobe Illustrator, I think
<Pezz> everyone's good at drawing something, it's finding what that is ;)
<K_A> I want to get a sketchbook so I can try my hand at it, but I'm *horrid* at drawing.
<Sumica> 00,10Dontforget no spoilers alowed here till one day after the ep
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> it's AI
<emangamer> ^
<Meanwhile> You missed harder than a blind man playing darts.
<BronyCon> wut
<TheBanteringBrony> Oh, shipping
<BronyCon> Muted?
<RaveBrony> Mhhm, gotta wait 24 hours :)
<Lucid> Hmm, I wonder what he's drawing. It's gotta be Cheerilee x Doctor Whooves
<BronyCon> the fuck
<BronyCon> broadcast is dead
<emangamer> I dont see how wrek can draw so well with a mouse. whenever I try to do that it looks terrible
<Meanwhile> You missed like Stevy Wonder at golf.
<Randomnerd> I really DO like this latest episode.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Iweywrt> Its cheerilee and Big Mac
<otakon> and thus I'm GLAD I watched the leaked ep!
<Jim> probably Cheerilee and Mac
<emangamer> maybe I need to reduce my sensitivity when I try to draw on my computer
<otakon> bc I had a feeling this would happen
<Big_Jakeintosh> it kinda annoys me that my dad my uncle and both of my brothers are good at drawing and stuff like that and I am not so I figure I should give it a shot
<Meanwhile> You missed like Zatoichi playing snooker.
<Sumica> 00,10emangamer he's using a tablet
<NovaMarcellus> wonder why my vid is lagging so bad with no one on
<Chaospony> Same eman... same here
<otakon> Meanwhile: ENOUGH of the blind metaphors!
<emangamer> Sumica: oh...wah?
<Pale_Horse> Drawing ponies also prolongs lifespan, cures cancer, and gives the secret to achieving enlightenment... *DISCLAIMER*: Any or all of the above statement may contain trace amounts of untruth.
<Meanwhile> But I was on a roll :(
<otakon> yh
<Lucid> Big Mac? No way. Hmm, now that I think about it, it looks kinda like Twilight.
<otakon> a barrel roll
<Sumica> 00,10he uses mouse for vectors but tablet for sketching
<Meanwhile> :'(
<K_A> Doesn't one draw out the 3D form first, then add lower-level detail?
<otakon> lol
*SaxyPretender pats Meanwhile on the back
<Kazahana> Biff MacIntosh!
<Golakka> How long before i see this on a drawfriend? :op
<Golakka> :P
<emangamer> Sumica: is that the thing that you plug into your computer, draw on and it appears on your screen?
<Chaospony> Yes
<K_A> emangamer: Yes, it's magical.
<Thunderpony> What are these songs!?
<Meanwhile> Well, you missed, is the basic underlying point of that.
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed Tablets are pretty affordable too
<emangamer> I want one know....they look epic
<Chaospony> I need one.... ...
<canman512> remixes
<K_A> Wow, that is a great expression.
<NovaMarcellus> I find it easier just to draw on paper then scan for sadly I dont have tablet
<Lucid> Love that expression
<Randomnerd> Awww that drawing.
<autumn> dwwwwwwaaaaa
<autumn> :)
<pony_19> give him a mullet
<Pezz> if you lack a tablet, scanners are always good :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Dat Big Mac face
<Sumica> 00,10yeah emangamer
<Meanwhile> Anyway, I don't really have anything better to do but I need to go pretend that I do. So I shall see those of you who're present for eurostream when it's on. Toodles~
<Pale_Horse> So Big Mac is the antagonist from Back To The Future now?... "Why don't you make like a tree, and get the hoof outta here."
<Thunderpony> There are some cheap but well worth it tablets
<NovaMarcellus> lol for face
<RaveBrony> Geez...so jelly of these skills....
<Meanwhile> Seeya for eurostream everypony.
<emangamer> bye Meanwhile
<Pezz> Bamboo from Wacom are good starter tablets
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Meanwhile
<Jim> laters Meanwhile
<Iweywrt> What kind of tablet do you recommend? Cause my current one is crap.
<pony_19> so what about the background?
<HeavyMetalDash> Cheerliee looks like the pony in control here XD
<NovaMarcellus> To google!
<Golakka> Cheerilee wears the trousers?
<Pezz> and in terms of tablets generally, Wacom is the brand you want
<emangamer> dis super ponybeat remix of giggle at the ghosties
<K_A> Yeah, I hear about Wacom a lot from artists.
<Pezz> Trust makes some nice ones too
<Pale_Horse> "McFly you Bojo! Those boards don't work on water!" "Uless you've got POWAH!"
<Lucid> Yeah, I bet Cheerilee probably is in control. Something tells me that Big Mac just isn't all that assertive
<Sumica> 00,10some tablets are just touch pads some are more of a screen that you draw on.
<Golakka> Just because hes built like a brick shithouse :@
<emangamer> Lucid: considering he didn't say a single origional thought in the entire episode?
<K_A> Lucid: Of course, Big Mac is a lot like Fluttershy, really.
<Spark_Brave> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MejbOFk7H6c
<Golakka> Big Mac is similar to fluttershy, yet opposite kind of?
<Mistshadow> Big Mac x Cheerilee shippers are soon to be starting.. because it's now canon!
<Lucid> There's a difference between being shy and not being assertive.
<Golakka> Mists, you mean Continuing
<Golakka> :p
<Mistshadow> True
<Simon> gotta love this gif http://i.imgur.com/7EXAb.gif
<K_A> Lucid: But Fluttershy isn't really assertive, either.
<Jim> A rainbowdash-mario, neat
<HeavyMetalDash> She'll learn
<Pale_Horse> technically Dr. Whooves and Derpy are closer to being Canon from this episode than BM and C.
<Big_Jakeintosh> well I am gonna go as well see you guys possibly during the week but for sure next week later guys
<pony_19> she is passive
<K_A> HeavyMetalDash: ;)
<Lucid> That's true. But Big Mac doesn't really come across as shy in terms of not wanting to talk to ponies, more like he just doesn't have much to say
<emangamer> dat kitty mouth
<HeavyMetalDash> soft spoken you mean
<pony_19> hes just keeps to himself thats it
<Cavy> I'm off everypony. Keep it real..^.^
<Jim> cya Cavy
<Pale_Horse> Later tater.
<emangamer> bye Cavy
<Pezz> bais~
<Cavy> Bye Jim. Didn't see much of ya today =p
<NovaMarcellus> Smoopy bear
<Cavy> Hope you all enjoyed/enjoy the episode! I thought it was excellent.
<Cavy> Have fun@
<K_A> So is Cheerilee standing on a stool or something?
<NovaMarcellus> when did the episode air?
<MirrorImage> NovaMarcellus an hour ago
<K_A> NovaMarcellus: 10:30 AM EST.
<HeavyMetalDash> and now she's REALLY close
<Pale_Horse> they're lying next to each other... in bed... :D
<emangamer> K_A: they are both sitting down maybe
<Jim> d'aaw, that's so sweet
<NovaMarcellus> dang I wanted to see peoples reaction to jelly
<Mistshadow> Like,
<Mistshadow> earlier it airewd
<emangamer> UGH I've about had it with these namby pamby stories
<Lucid> Those pet names that they called each other, I'm going to have to remember some of them for when I get a marefriend
<Mistshadow> *aired
<emangamer> Lucid: good call
<Kazahana> Dat Twilight skin
<FlimFlam_BusinessPon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6mttNYfCi0
<Randomnerd> SO, RD's favorite game is just Battleship, Right?
<K_A> In b4 no video links
<emangamer> hey Wrek is that chrome thaty ou use?
<Jim> Wasn't it called Battle Clouds?
<Randomnerd> It wasn't named, I think.
<Pale_Horse> Watching that episode just made me how appreciate... how single I am. Ha cha!
<Lucid> If only to embarress her
<Jim> it looks like firefox
<NovaMarcellus> this picture is so full of daw
<Randomnerd> But it's as good a name as any, for sure.
<Golakka> wait, 4 joints on the leg? Does it work like that in the show, i havent noticed
<MirrorImage> stream isn't working for me - i think the wrong stream is on the website
<Pale_Horse> Although I do hope to find my destined Kismesis someday.
<pony_19> you fight for what you love i always say
<Jim> oh right, she said "You've rained on my cloud" and such during playing it
<emangamer> Golakka: most ponies/horses have 3 joints but hey, it's a cartoon
<Lucid> Yeah, no offense, but that leg looks....strange
<Jim> Seemed like it wasn't exactly battle ships
<Pale_Horse> Someone who defines me and completes me.. because I loathe them so much...
<Golakka> Yeah emangamer, I thought as much, something about the leg doesnt work sadly
<NovaMarcellus> I find that that is the hardest part to draw
<Golakka> I dont mean to be critical
<emangamer> Golakka: he knows he's doing...trust me
<CountDoofus> I've been single for nearly 28 years (as in, my whole life). beat that!
<CountDoofus> sad, I know
<Golakka> fair game
<Pale_Horse> HA! i'm 34! got you beat by 6 years!
<pony_19> this is not a fun game to play
<HeavyMetalDash> fortunattly I can't beat that
<CountDoofus> d'aww
<emangamer> wow....this argument is making me sad
<pony_19> yes oh lordy
<Pale_Horse> My work here is done then. *dusts off hooves*
<autumn> what program is this being made in?
<emangamer> autumn: I'm assuming adobe issistrator
<Golakka> Single for longer than i have graced this earth, :(
<NovaMarcellus> wow suddenly I feel like a kid lol
<Iweywrt> This argument is s awkward.
<emangamer> hey SuperBrony64 does someone want to change the topic of the channel?
<Golakka> haha! Ive not loved for longer! I WIN
<Golakka> wait.....
<HeavyMetalDash> This arguement is kind of stupid
<otakon> um
<Pale_Horse> Ahem. I said... *Dusts off hooves*
<Lucid> Well, since we're talking about relationships, I pose a question. In you all's opinions, is it better to date someone who's exactly like you, or someone who has slightly differing interests?
<otakon> it was EXACTLY like the setup for Battleships
<CountDoofus> Hmm
<fluttercry> 05,15Lucid the only real answer is to stay single
<emangamer> can we not get into the relationship conversation? from past experiences it isn't the best internet topic
<Iweywrt> Slightly different interests so you can expience more.
<Jim> Yeah, but with other pieces, like not ships I guess
*HeavyMetalDash excludes himself from the topic lest he starts stating theories
<K_A> I have little interest in getting a girlfriend. Everybody at work jokes about it.
<emangamer> fluttercry: a strange game...the only winning move is not to play
<CountDoofus> autumn: Adobe Illustrator
<NovaMarcellus> Hmm as long as you arent totally different like big mac and rainbow
<Jim> Same concept and rules I suppose
<Randomnerd> Hasbro owns the rights to Battleship, they could have done so :D
<autumn> thanks emangamer i was thinking it was somthing close to that
<diddutz> is wrek delighting us with his drawing skillz again?
<Golakka> I honestly cant say lucid, Ive stil never found the right girl :p
<Lucid> Alright then, sorry to bring it up then
<otakon> exactlly
<otakon> oh
<Randomnerd> God, that just reminded me they're making a movie.
<pony_19> you just havent found that someone,, i know that feel all to well
<emangamer> so, how boud dem PONIES???
<Randomnerd> :[ There is no need for that.
<Pale_Horse> Big Mac is shrinking! :O
<RAWRity> ┻━┻ ︵ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ︵ ┻━┻
<K_A> The magic of software. Try doing this on paper.
<otakon> who thinks the Battlship movie is gonna be a 200 Million Dollar waste of time?
<fluttercry> 05,15Why hasbro! WHYYYYY
<RAWRity> Flip ALL the tables
<otakon> go Harumph
<otakon> HARUMPH
<emangamer> RAWRity: dat...spam? does that cound as spam?
<Pale_Horse> he got into some poison joke. :P
<RAWRity> emangamer: no, counts as table flipping
<K_A> I refuse for Shift-JIS art to be counted as spam!
<autumn> countdoofus: thank you to :)
<Lucid> Well, I'm going to see it, cause explosions
<CountDoofus> sooo... Inkscape. so that's totally free drawing software, and a good one to boot?
<mario_pony> Lucid: i think someone exactly like yourself.
<CountDoofus> you're welcome :-)
<Lucid> In other movie news, I am pretty damn excited for Act of Valor
<Randomnerd> Harumph!
<emangamer> now I want to draw....but my drawing notepad is 5 states away... :/
<NovaMarcellus> dang, I love this song but why does it lag so...
<RAWRity> emangamer: find paper.
<pony_19> note book?
<Golakka> id imagine you would need some things to disagree apon, Its healthy to argue and debate :p
<Pale_Horse> hidsight is 20/20
<emangamer> one good thing did come out of this episode. I like cherelee a lot more now
<K_A> Oh, this is inkscape? Interesting. I thought InkScape was purely for "vectoring."
<Randomnerd> I guarentee that it'll turn a profit, though.
<pony_19> you can still practice with paper
<otakon> Lucid: I will line your seat with Baynium
<emangamer> K_A: no it's not
<Golakka> Pale_Horse, Im gonna use that quote, if thats ok :p
<Wrek> 05no this is still illustrator
<Pale_Horse> Yeah. sadly it's not...
<K_A> I thought so.
<Lucid> What can I say, I like explosions
<K_A> The lasso tool looked too familiar. =P
<Pale_Horse> Sure. Go right ahead. :)
<otakon> but come ON!
<Lucid> Of course, I'm also a naval geek
<NovaMarcellus> All I have is photoshop elements 9
<RAWRity> I loved this episode. I really like it when we see the CMC together and it's NOT about their god damn cutie marks.
*otakon facepalms
<Randomnerd> I saw Bayformers 1&2, and then realized they didn't deserve my money -so I'm not watching 3 or Battleship.
<emangamer> OH, MY, GOD...best wall paper ever

<otakon> ^^
<NovaMarcellus> still trying to figure it out
<Jim> oh emangamer, that's awesome :)
<RAWRity> emangamer: seen it
<pony_19> that was adorable
<otakon> fucking Bayformer
<emangamer> RAWRity: and?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh Pink Floyd, y u so gdlk?
<Krakass> Yeah, acts of valor looks good.
<CountDoofus> no, I was wondering if Inkscape is a good tool for beginning drawers
<RAWRity> O U
<otakon> bc it sure as hell wasn't Transformers
<Lucid> I don't get all the hate for the transformers movie. What's so bad about it?
<RAWRity> U SO SHMOOPY
<otakon> well
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<fluttercry> 05,15EXPLOSIONS
<otakon> it's the hard on Bay has for the US military
<fluttercry> 05,15BOOM
<fluttercry> 05,15BANG
<Tovler|Hungover> k, back.
<fluttercry> 05,15HOT CHICK
<K_A> CountDoofus: I am not a good artist, but I would propose getting a cheap sketchbook first.
<fluttercry> 05,15that's what's wrong with it
*mario_pony is depressed
<otakon> and the fact that you don't even SEE the Transformers that much
<K_A> Start old-fashioned to save money, in case it's not your thing.
<Tovler|Hungover> The Rock was pretty awesome Bay movie.
<emangamer> I still need an OC pony...I would have one if SOMEPONY *cough RAWRity cough* hadn't shit all over my last one
<Saturn> 08,01i'm currently drinking from a juice box
<Cypresswolf> aww, and I just changed my background to Ahuizotl holding Daring Do...I'll change it tomorrow
<HeavyMetalDash> oh noes pic is spoiler!
<Saturn> 08,01does... does this mean i'm cute now?
*Jim pats mario_pony on the head "There there"
<otakon> the TRANSFORMERS take a back seat in a MOVIE abotu THE TRANSFORMERS
*HeavyMetalDash head asplodes
<emangamer> HeavyMetalDash: how so?
<Randomnerd> ^
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15yes Saturn very much so
<Saturn> 08,01EVENING EVERYPONY! \o/
<emangamer> Ohai Saturn
<Randomnerd> I mean, I get that it's a toy commercial.
<NovaMarcellus> I love making oc's
<Cypresswolf> Good Evening :)
<RAWRity> emangamer: again. I made one comment about it. I never did anything even CLOSE to "shitting all over" it.
<pony_19> good evenin
<otakon> Saturn: no, you'd have to be small and yellow and equine for that to happen
<Lucid> And? It's Transformers, it's not supposed to be a plodding plot oriented movie. Though I will admit that I greatly disliked the whole love story thing
<Jim> Juice box makes everything sweeter
<Tovler|Hungover> I only truly hated Transformers 2.
<emangamer> I dont want to hear it RAWRity
<Jim> hello Saturn
<otakon> Lucid: no, I'm not talkig about the story
<RAWRity> emangamer: so yeah, Get over it.
<diddutz> evening Saturn
<TOY_PON3> Well..I just seen the new episode
*mario_pony has not had his first love yet.
<Cypresswolf> Weekly basis, how often do you change your wallpaper?
<emangamer> but I've got to go everypony :(...see you all later
<otakon> besides ofc the debacle that was 3's plot
<CountDoofus> K_A: I've made a sketch of dancing Fluttershy, I'll PM you the link if you wanna see
*emangamer hugs #bronystate
<CountDoofus> seeya eman
<Jim> Take care emangamer
<Randomnerd> ...and Meagan Fox doesn't do it for me, tbh.
<K_A> CountDoofus: Doo eet.
<Lucid> It's a movie about giant robots fighting. There's going to be explosions
<RAWRity> cybin: Iunno. I change it whenever I find something better than my current one.
<TOY_PON3> My rating is..
<otakon> but for a movie called Transformers, you don't see them that much
<K_A> The closest I've come to art is doing stupid Photoshops.
<otakon> Lucid: ALL YOU SEE IS EXPLOSIONS!
<otakon> plues
<Golakka2> Erm
<NovaMarcellus> Right now im drawing changeling twi from backwards through the mirror
<HeavyMetalDash> Drawing is one of my three passions
<pony_19> its an art to an exrtent
<otakon> I did not like the new robot designs personally
<Golakka2> apparently Golakka is still here
<Cypresswolf> I've changed it 4 times since last saturday
<emangamer> before I leave I'll just leave this right here: v
<emangamer> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz5rnpIMHU1r3shcio1_500.jpg
<NovaMarcellus> It is harder than I expected
<otakon> do I have to MENTION the giant wrecking balls?
<Randomnerd> She should go the Leslie Neilsen route: "You're a good looking person in a town full of good-looking people. Do comedies"
<Pale_Horse> "How are you gentleponies? you are on the way to destruction. you have no chance to survive. Make your time... Ha ha ha!"
<Golakka2> my internet blinked out, so can one of the Ops kick my ghost?
<otakon> or the damn ghetto twins?
<Lucid> Well, yeah that was kind of stupid I will admit
<Randomnerd> otakon: Ugh.
<CountDoofus> d'aww, poor scoots
<fluttercry> 05,15If transformers was really about giant robots fighting that would have been great. but it wasn't! It was about that damn kid!
<Saturn> 08,01http://imgur.com/axskU
<emangamer> Golakka: is it registered?
<otakon> or how about the railgun
<pony_19> aw man no more doodles
<Randomnerd> Exactly.
<Golakka2> No, but it is me :p
<String_Shredder> dat meh
<otakon> that is NEVER mentioned or used again
<TOY_PON3> Well I was crying while angry before watching so 1/10, then I kept watching so 4/10, then I by the end of the episode I say..6/10
<Randomnerd> Transformers is made to sell toys.
<Jim> dat homer in the background
<otakon> that would have been DAMN USEFUL
<emangamer> Wrek: what do you think of my pic?;
<fluttercry> 05,15all I can look at is the screaming homer
<TOY_PON3> Would've gave it a 9/10 but I was alone while watching.
<Golakka2> I forgot to put money in the eletrickery meter, and the power went out
<Cypresswolf> If I changed my bg on a daily basis with all the pony pics I have saved, it would take almost 3 years to get through them all
<Randomnerd> The main Fan Wiki literally says that in an entry! Just show the robots!
<otakon> yh
<Golakka2> And now the broadcast is offline :(
<Randomnerd> I'm not expecting shakespeare, I GET that!
<RAWRity> http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/426391_2821160333475_1392930293_32534012_1394409739_n.jpg
<Pale_Horse> Actually, a comic spoofing the Zero Wing intro with the cast replaced with ponies would actually be pretty awesome...
<emangamer> RAWRity: I dont get it
<Saturn> 08,01does drinking from a juicebox make me cuter? http://imgur.com/axskU
<Jim> 20% cuter
<K_A> Meh is not a proper reaction to romance.
<TOY_PON3> And also I don't like Big Mac and Cheerilee ship
<RAWRity> Saturn: ...sorta
<emangamer> Saturn: no, you are not a fluttershy
<emangamer> TOY_PON3: its not a ship, IT'S CANON
<Randomnerd> I know what action movies are, I know the writing will be pathetic :(
<Golakka> Thats it back now :p
<Saturn> 08,01emangamer: how do you know i'm not a fluttershy wearing a saturn suit?
<RAWRity> actually, it's not canon either
<K_A> Saturn: No, but that is an epic painting in the background.
<autumn> is issistrator vastly superior to Photoshop?
<otakon> and ofc the sweeping shots of the US military in action
<Tovler|Hungover> I guess I liked Transformers 1 because I was expecting something abysmal and instead I got a watchable movie.
<Pale_Horse> welcome back
<Golakka> Is the broadcast offline, or am i just derping
<emangamer> Saturn: O.o touche
<otakon> or for that matter
<otakon> the sweeping shots in general
<TOY_PON3> RAWRity: What is it then?
<otakon> WHY SO MANY SWEEPING SHOT!?
<NovaMarcellus> I to would like to know
<K_A> autumn: I'm told it's drawing tools are better suited for, well, drawing.
<NovaMarcellus> Because photoshop is annoying me lately
<K_A> I wouldn't know as I'm just a Shop junkie.
<Randomnerd> otakon: "Michael Bay gets military hardware the way we call out for pizza"
<Pale_Horse> That's crazy talk... you're crazy...
<otakon> but yh, first Transformers was watchable, 2 was an abomination, and I'm NEVER seeing 3
<Cypresswolf> Wait a moment...how deep was Big Mac blushing? He's already red
<K_A> I should really resume coloring that one fan book, or making a wallpaper.
<otakon> Randomnerd: lol
<CountDoofus> somehow, I'm thinking the body of Cheerilee should be removed, Big Mac's the way it is, and then draw a large around them
<CountDoofus> but that's me
<K_A> *its drawing
<RAWRity> TOY_PON3: seeing as they didn't get together, it's technically a sunk ship.
<CountDoofus> a large heart* even
<otakon> you know what's a good movie with explosions?
<otakon> RED
<Randomnerd> ^
<NovaMarcellus> meh
<Tovler> Transformers 3 was vexing.
<otakon> you all should have seen that
<Randomnerd> And it was funny!
<otakon> ^^
<otakon> so MUCH
<Dismo> No stream? ;w;
<Tovler> But man, Transformers 3 with Rifftrax was hilarious.
<otakon> Malkovich stole the show
<Jim> Dismo: There is a stream
<autumn> thanks K_A ill look into it more.....
*String_Shredder sways lighter back and forth "WOOOOOOO"
<Randomnerd> The Losers was okay. I liked how they went to the Soccer game at the end.
<Jim> I approve of this music
<autumn> i g2g night :)
<Gransipfransen> dafuq
<RAWRity> really, the biggest thing in this ep for me...Death is now Canon.
<otakon> I never saw that one
<Jim> Good night autumn
<otakon> but hay
<TOY_PON3> Yup
*bronyguru5 gives everypony a brohoof
<Jim> (\
<otakon> the A Team movie was pretty good too
<Pale_Horse> *brohoof*
<RAWRity> also, Religion of some sort is now canon.
<Randomnerd> Never saw. I've never seen a full episode of the A-Team, even.
<otakon> me neither
<bronyguru5> jesus pony
<NovaMarcellus> and he's to obssessed with loads of jelly!
<pony_19> i never realized how easy it was to color like this
*autumn brohoof
<K_A> Wrek: Why not import it into Illustrator and sample there?
<otakon> do I didn't have anything to base it against
<Cypresswolf> -_- too tired to think up positive feedback...i dunno what to say
<K_A> Or are you applying lighting?
<NovaMarcellus> where on earth did that even come from
<otakon> as a cold watching I liked it
<Pale_Horse> You mean everypony dosen't worship Celestia?
<RAWRity> you know, I have to imagine what the ramifications of religion in equestria has when they actually have 2 Gods as their monarchs.
<NovaMarcellus> Luna ftw!
<fluttercry> 05,15Warhammer 40K
<Jim> I wouldn't really call Celestia and Luna gods
<fluttercry> 05,15that's what it means
<RAWRity> I mean, imagine if WE could do that?
<otakon> and then I killed chat
<otakon> I'M SORRY!
<TOY_PON3> Celestia and Luna aren't gods
*Jim pokes otakon
<pony_19> then their would be choas
<otakon> wub
<Jim> ohai there
<NovaMarcellus> Still need back story
<Jim> :3
<TOY_PON3> They are princesses
<Pale_Horse> but.. they LITERALLY make the Sun and the Moon rise and set each day... :/
<otakon> I wub when poked now
<RAWRity> Jim: they're immortal (at least it seems that way), have magic power beyond the unicorns, and can contrl celestial bodies, demi-gods at the VERY least.
<Ingwaz> kill it with fire!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Wrek, I'm loving how this picture's coming out so much
<otakon> it's all this exposure to Ponyium
<NovaMarcellus> maybe future twi can give some insite
<K_A> Pale_Horse: But so can normal unicorns working together.
<TOY_PON3> Maybe a higher power gave them the power to?
<Randomnerd> It's okay
<Randomnerd> We're okay
<CountDoofus> he makes it look so easy, doesn't he?
<otakon> *phew*
<Randomnerd> I got distracted by teh youtubes
<TOY_PON3> Indeed
<otakon> yes he does
<Cypresswolf> I'm still pondering the whole cutie mark is based on your special talent thing when there are ponies like Screwloose...
<otakon> and as such we're jelly
<Pale_Horse> Hmm. the concept of an "Overgod" controlling other gods isn't new. Forgotten Realms uses the idea with Lord Ao.
<otakon> Cypresswolf: or barking mad?
<NovaMarcellus> I loved both paradise's and secret tub fun's rendition on equestrian mythos
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: just think of it this way: There just so happen to be a lot of ponies' whose special talent is one-off jokes.
<Jim> I really like how the drawing is coming out
<otakon> ah
<Cypresswolf> yes, or Lucy Screw
<Randomnerd> Yeah, no more Bayformers.
<Randomnerd> No Battleship.
<CountDoofus> I expected Sweetie Belle to get a singing cutie mark in the latest episode... meh
<Jim> What's a bayformer?
<Golakka> Can anyone give me a hand, It is telling me the stream is offline, ive refreshed many times, and its apparent its still going
<pony_19> didnt the original kindom just start off of someone taking the lead cause nobody wanted to, and one of them down the line just stretch their abilities a bit
<Randomnerd> Michael Bay's Transformer Movies
<Pale_Horse> thy logging out and back on
<K_A> CountDoofus: I doubt the CMC will get cutiemarks any time soon.
<Pale_Horse> try I mean
<K_A> In during ticker.
<Kazahana> Golakka, did the same thing for me.
<Randomnerd> I find the Navy eternally fascinating, all the same.
<RAWRity> CountDoofus: trust me, none of the CMC are getting their cutie marks unless it's the focus of the episode.
<True-Seed> how old is granny smith? watch winter wrap up then watch family appreciation day. she's hundreds of years old!!
<K_A> Golakka: Try clearing cache.
<Kazahana> I just opened the stream on Livestream and popped out the chat
<CountDoofus> season 2 finale / season 3 opener perhaps?
<Golakka> kk
<RAWRity> Something like that isn't just gonna happen in the middle of an episode that isn't focused on it.
<RAWRity> CountDoofus: maybe. I'm leaning towads some time in S3 myself.
<Dismo> I keep refreshing and the broadcast is offline ;o;
<Lucid> Any guesses as to what Scewtaloo's cutie mark will be?
<Randomnerd> Though I despair at the political implications of 11 Carrier Groups.
<NovaMarcellus> I wonder what they are going to do for the final episode of the season
<K_A> Indeed, that would be a huge event, seeing how there are several episodes completely focused on them trying to get cutiemarks.
<CountDoofus> a stunt driver's helmet for Scootaloo
<NovaMarcellus> At least season 1 mentioned the gala in the second episode
<Cypresswolf> I foresee some jealousy when one of the CMC gets thier cutie mark first. judging on how this season has gone so far. although, SB & Scoot were very excited when AB had the loopty hoop one...
<K_A> I hope Discord returns as an anti-hero.
<Randomnerd> England has the most after us, with 3. And we're allies.
<Red_Pegasus> Scoots cutiemark will be a Scooter.
<HeavyMetalDash> well Wrek has me all inspired and stuff now so I gotta go feed my addictions now
<Krakass> It's only going to be 10 for a while.
<Dismo> I think that WOULD be how it happens. A completely random event that the CMC get cutie marks.
<Randomnerd> Ach, nevermind.
<HeavyMetalDash> Bai Everypony <3
<Pale_Horse> Well, they ARE the "Cutie Mark Crusaders". If they actually got their cutie marks, it would remove a source of drama, and thus storytelling options.
<Rhymeless_Zebra> Later
<Jim> bye HeavyMetalDash
<K_A> Am I the only dork who actually signs his name legibly? :|
<NovaMarcellus> The return of discord would be bucking awsome
<otakon> see ya HeavyMetalDash
<pony_19> will there be a back story for discord?
<otakon> K_A yes
<Dismo> Or maybe they all get Cutie marks that have something to do with one another.
<RAWRity> Personally, I think it's more likely that if One gets their CM before the others, I can foresee an ep where they try to help the others, and start to get a big head about it.
<Rhymeless_Zebra> I think people are still waiting for the Nightmare Moon Origin episode
<Pale_Horse> Discord is just Q deciding to mess with ponies for a while insead of Picard.
<CountDoofus> I'm guessing: stunt driver helmet for Scoot, a microphone for Sweetie, and a hammer crossing a chisel for Apple Bloom
<Spark_Brave> you forgot the Cheerilee's tail
<Pale_Horse> that's his freakin backstory for ya. :P
<RAWRity> or, 2 of the CMC get theirs, and ther 3rd starts to feel left out.
<Spark_Brave> why did i put "the" in there?
<lol> what grapic editor he use?
<K_A> Pale_Horse: OMG, what if Discord takes the Mane 6 to the very origins of ponies or life in Equestria?
<RAWRity> Illustrator
<Wrek> 05http://i.imgur.com/zutGw.png for those that want it
<Cypresswolf> I wonder what it will take for the CMC to figure out its based on something they like? That will be a fantastic episode
<Randomnerd> The problem with "Battleship" is that it's public domain.
<Spark_Brave> you forgot her tail
<Jim> Awesme Wrek
<StickySyrup> hey everypony
<Jim> hi StickySyrup
<StickySyrup> chat quiter now?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14aaaaaand favorited
<K_A> Spark_Brave: No, it's there as a line.
<pony_19> its nice
<NovaMarcellus> this drawing is making me feel self consious
<Pale_Horse> And then, because of a event they caused in the prsent that traved backward in time, Life never BEGAN on Equestria!!! :O
<Wrek> 05that had been valid Spark_Brave, if i had finished it
<Cypresswolf> yep, main stream is over until 2 when movie stream starts again.
<Rhymeless_Zebra> That was awesome
<K_A> Wrek: Over 240 people stuck around *just* to watch you draw. I wish I could warrant such a response.
<Pale_Horse> And only Dr. Whooves can help put things right again... :D
<CountDoofus> so Cheerilee's cutie mark is in the same boat as her tail? 'sokay, me gusta
<Pale_Horse> Best. Episode. Ever.
<RAWRity> Considering what we learned about the Prince and Princess in today's episode, I'm personally under the assumption that There were at least a few centuries where Equestria existed before Celestia/Luna were around.
<Red_Pegasus> Don't forget Derpy, Derpy can go back in time too.
<otakon> DRAW Gummy Wrek!
<Pale_Horse> too true.
<otakon> DRAW Gummy Wrek!
<Lucid> Cheerilee x Twilight
<TheBanteringBrony> FLUTTERMAC
<K_A> RAWRity: There are a lot of theories about it.
<TheBanteringBrony> FLUTTERMAC
<Jim> Gummy
<MirrorImage> is there a youtube of the video up yet?
<NovaMarcellus> fluttermac
<mario_pony> make a super mario pony!!
<Randomnerd> At least according to Wikipedia. Hasbro has the copyright to the name, but they can't copyright "imaginary naval combat" any more than "32 Pieces on a board of 64 squares"
<Kazahana> RARITY! ;)
<Spark_Brave> OK Go ponies?
<K_A> It's funny because I have refined my penmanship but can draw at all.
<Jim> hmm, right
<Pale_Horse> Nuh uh! not as bad as MY handwriting. it's like tring to decipher Linear B.
<NovaMarcellus> better than mine
<RAWRity> and perhaps the chaos caused by the Love Poison spawned Discord, and thus Celestia and Luna were created as personifications (er, ponyfications?) of the Alicorns on the flag.
<Cypresswolf> I wonder whats going on on the Hub for a 2 week lack of new pony between Feb 18 & March 3...
<Lucid> My handwriting is worst handwriting
<pony_19> in a pub
<mario_pony> hey Wrek make a super mario pony!!please
<CountDoofus> MirrorImage: you mean of the latest episode? It was leaked before it officially aired, so I assume there's good quality videos out there
<Lucid> Hmm, Luna maybe?
<Rhymeless_Zebra> I personally vote for more Zecora art
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: they have a tendency to take weird breaks during the season.
<pony_19> lyra
<MirrorImage> CountDoofus - i'm aware of that, but i'm pretty sure Hasbro pounced on all of those ones
<NovaMarcellus> How my teachers were able to discipher mine is beyond me
<StickySyrup> horrary for UK bronys not having to get up till late to watch ponies on saturdays
<RAWRity> For instance, we had to wait 3 weeks between ROH 2 and Lesson Zero
<K_A> Rainbow Dash. I can tell from the smirk.
<Krakass> They should just air an episode every other week. Then we'd have year round ponies.
<NovaMarcellus> I would still love to see a past sins movie
*Jim gives StickySyrup an eurobrony brohoof
<Spark_Brave> @ NovaMarcellus: Same here, mine is awful
<Asmalya> Oh god
<Asmalya> the music on the stream is so goood
*StickySyrup respects brohoof commitment
<K_A> Sonic?
<Pale_Horse> Dang UK ponies... Think they're so great because they don't have to get up as early... and because we wouldn't have Dr. Whooves without them. *grumble mumble*
<NovaMarcellus> wait wuts he drawing?
<Lucid> a hoof...
<RAWRity> i know there's at least one HD vid of the new ep still on YT
<K_A> Octavia.
<fluttercry> 05,15brb everypony
<Lucid> Octavia
<StickySyrup> Pale_Horse: XD We wouldnt have MLP is it wasnt for US
<Jim> wonder what this will be
<Pale_Horse> Bye Dr. Nick.
<NovaMarcellus> the one I watched it on died =(
<Cypresswolf> yep, worst one was between Hearths Warming Eve & Family Appreciation Day
<K_A> No, I think it really is Sonic.
<Jim> pony on a pole...right
<K_A> N/m
<CountDoofus> pole dancing pony?
<NovaMarcellus> is he drawing fleur poledancing???
<Lucid> ^^This
<Cypresswolf> walking stick...
<Cypresswolf> staff...
<Lucid> Either way, I think I like where this is going
<Pale_Horse> Fleur has wayyyyy too much class and self-respect to pole-dance.
<K_A> This riff reminds me of U2, honestly.
<RAWRity> also, i vote we name the Jelly obsessed stallion in today's ep "Jelly Jiggler"
<Cypresswolf> vine...
<Krakass> Pole dancing is good cardio.
<K_A> "U Jelly"
<CountDoofus> tbh, there has only 1 MLP episode I truly disliked
<Lucid> I vote we name him Jay Loe
<NovaMarcellus> same with rarity yet there are so many fics where she has so little
<Cypresswolf> which ep, Count?
<CountDoofus> Over a Barrel ("Hey there. Welcome to Aaaapleloosa!")
<Lucid> It's a pony with a staff. Or, it could be a guitar
<Randomnerd> If there's Battleship in MLP, will there be MLP in Battleship?
<K_A> Lucid: Hoofgazer pony.
<NovaMarcellus> rainbow with a guitar?
<RAWRity> I have 2 eps that I dislike, but even then there are parts of each that I still enjoyed.
*Randomnerd will watch if there's ponies hidden in Battleship.
<Deus> so...another 2 hours then....DRAT
<Jim> hmm, good idea ^^
<Lucid> There's ponies in my battleship!
<CountDoofus> the idea of taking ancestral ground in exchange for apple pies? ...wut?
<K_A> I have yet not to like an episode.
<Pale_Horse> hey. this bargain rite-aid cola is actually pretty good... :/
<NovaMarcellus> I suddenly thought of horizons seeing deus
*Tovler images a MLP movie trailer looking like Battleship and Transformers.
<Deus> Nova: wat
<Deus> NovaMarcellus:
<Cypresswolf> I want to get back to my drawing practice, as soon as Im done with my current classes, I'll pick up my pencils agian
<NovaMarcellus> Name of caracter
<NovaMarcellus> lol
<RAWRity> First one is Over A Barrel (let's take one of the grimmest parts of America's history, and make it into a kids' show! 8D)
<Deus> im just....GOD!
<NovaMarcellus> love that fic
<Lucid> Tovler, that sounds like something I would watch
<Lucid> Of course, at this point, I would watch just about anything
<RAWRity> and the other is The Mysterious Mare-Do-Well (Friend is acting boastful about being hero? Make another hero and spend all your time with friend bragging about hero)
<K_A> Pale_Horse: A lot of cheap sodas are surprisingly good.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14we need a Gaijin 4koma using this: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2735/
<NovaMarcellus> ya that episode was disapointing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14looooooved that scene
<Lucid> Yeah, I wasn't all that impressed with Mare-do-well.
<CountDoofus> yeah, wasn't a big fan of RD's attitude in that ep either
<Deus> Why arent you showing the mare-a-thon?
<Cypresswolf> watching these have helped me improve, got the basic shape for ponies down. my sketches are getting closer to looking like the thing I intended
<LordCelestia> 0,5Deus the mare-a-thon is over
<CountDoofus> because Deus, the mare-a-thon is already over
<Deus> wait
<Deus> then...what about the latest episode?
<LordCelestia> 0,5It ended a half hour ago
<CountDoofus> also over
<K_A> Deus: It came on at 6:00 AM EST. Don't ask why.
<Deus> :(
<Randomnerd> Sweeping views of Canterlot
<Deus> but
<NovaMarcellus> what?
<Deus> but
<LordCelestia> 0,5Time zones, my friend
<LordCelestia> 0,5Infamous time zones
<Randomnerd> Lots of Royal Guards all over the place :D
<K_A> Truly an airing intended for the most hardcore bronies. Or for little children who wake up early.
<Deus> the...countdown
<Deus> I KNOW that
<RAWRity> I was FINE with RD's attitude in Mare-Do-Well. It was the OTHER members of the Mane 6 that were my problem.
<CountDoofus> That drawing! I'm dying to know how it'll look like in the end!
<LordCelestia> 0,5Countdown? people actually look at that broken old thing?
<RAWRity> the countdown is for the Euroshow of Brony Movie Night
<CountDoofus> looks kinda Mass Effect-like
<RAWRity> NOT the latest ep.
<K_A> LordCelestia: You guys need to replace it with a Javascript implementation.
<unfoundbug> lord. yes
<Tovler> I'd imagine a MLP movie being very similar to Thor.
<Pale_Horse> It was awesome. Twilight and Rarity had a gunfight/swordfight to the death, and the the episode ended with twilight pointing her hoof at all the assembled gunponioes, saying "Bang" and slumping to the ground dead.
<unfoundbug> i missed the first half og the ep because of it
<Deus> a bugger it
<Jim> This is dead space ponies I think
<Deus> youtube then
<Wrek> 05might continue a bit on this one
<unfoundbug> and !cd doesnt work in main room
<Jim> I'd watch that
<Cypresswolf> that pic...is it based off of ... what was that fanfic...the one with Twilight Spark?
<Lucid> Yeah, I don't quite understand what their logic was. "Hmm, instead of telling our friend that they're bragging too much, why don't we all take on the role of a superhero?
<CountDoofus> never played Dead Space (I hate horror stuff, lol)
<Lucid> I don't know what's going on in this picture, but I like it
<RAWRity> Lucid: and the biggest issue is, they could have fixed that!
<Wrek> 05meh fuck this
*RainbowJack hugs TOY_PON3
<CountDoofus> have I gone blind?
<Lucid> Yeah, the plot of that episode felt very contrived
<K_A> Wrek: That feel.
<Jim> stream went away
<Wrek> 05goan do this
<Pale_Horse> Yay! it's the Night's into Dreams game again!
<NovaMarcellus> ?
<EpeditionaryBrony> Where can we see that artwork, Wrek?
<Wrek> 05johntb.deviantart.com
<Randomnerd> Shiny, with Rainbow Bridges...
<RAWRity> Instead of the scene with the RD fanclub, have the cold open be RD saying somepony and being called a hero. Then, in the time left open from that scene being moved, put in a scene where RD almost gets somepony hurt because she's busy braggin.
<NovaMarcellus> guess I will take a break and start up again mine
<Wrek> 05nope
<Lucid> Besides, it wasn't really that big of a deal for her to be bragging
<RAWRity> then, get rid of the scene where the Mane 6 are talking up mare-do-well, and instead put in a scene where they try to talk to RD about being full of herself.
<Lucid> It's not like it was really hurting anyponty
<CountDoofus> HO GOD
<Jim> Ohai Dead Space
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Lucid> DOO EET
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh boy
<Rainbovv_Dash> why do i have a VEEMI stream that dont work?
<emangamer> Ohai
<K_A> My friend played this. IMO, it looks too much like an FPS and not and RPG. :\
<LordCelestia> 0,5Stream is on replay I thought
<Cypresswolf> Nice! Imma turn off the lights :)
<NovaMarcellus> DEAD SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LordCelestia> 0,5BEcause I saw that other girl thing from earlier
<Rhymeless_Zebra> Giggle at the Ghosties....its not very effective..
<Pale_Horse> Cut off their limbs!!!
<bronyguru5> HOO BOY DEAD SACE
<bronyguru5> space
<RAWRity> there, you have a believeable, relateable story where the characters aren't immediately and unwarrantedly jumping into hijinks.
<K_A> Wait, crap.
<Pale_Horse> necromorph ponies would be scary... >.>
<CountDoofus> right! I think I hear my fanfiction calling. "Count, work on me! I yearn to be completed!" gotta run, seeya everypony and thanks again for the stream! ya'll are the best!
<K_A> I'm thinking of a completely different game.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14O_O
<Cypresswolf> that one got me :)
<Pale_Horse> Although I'm more a fan of Amnesia myself.
<String_Shredder> dead space should be a movie
<Dr_Fumbles> Oh my gooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Yellowquiet> BIG MAC SPOKE!
<Jim> That wasn't scary at all *shivers in the corner*
<Yellowquiet> and hi all ^^
<NovaMarcellus> I heard they were making one
<Randomnerd> Dead space? Whoa Nelly
<Jim> ohai Yellowquiet
<K_A> I like how this game uses a non-HUD based interface.
<NovaMarcellus> along with bioshock
<Dr_Fumbles> I friggen love dead space!
<Yellowquiet> i missed the ep stream today ^^
<Dark_Horst1> sup. dtream down?
<K_A> Oh, snap, this one's on PC.
<emangamer> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz8myo9wY01rnpo0wo1_500.jpg
<Lucid> Another movie that I really want to see is a Halo movie.
<Jim> There's dead space on my stream
<Pale_Horse> did you get this on the Steam sale for it a while ago?
<Jim> Is that the stream that's supposed to be on?
<bronyguru5> theres a zombie on my lawn
<Cypresswolf> I woke my roomate up the other night playing FO New Vegas. I was in the Repconn Rocket place with ghouls...and one snuck up on me
<Rhymeless_Zebra> I wanted to be a zombie next yeeear
<Lucid> Stoopid zombies, get off my lawn
<K_A> OK, guys, I'm gonna go on now and try to do something productive of my own. (in b4 Skyrim)

<Cypresswolf> I dont know why, but I just want to go to walmart and get a cake! It just feels like a day for cake
<Jim> Ingwaz: yup
<Ingwaz> i get to watch someone scream like a little girl
<mario_pony> soo who's exited for the new twilight movie?
<Pale_Horse> Everyday is the right day for cake.
<Kazahana> Dark_Horst, I had the same problem, so I just opened it on livestream.
<Jim> Twilight Sparkle is getting a movie mario_pony ?
<Kazahana> superbrony64
<NovaMarcellus> lol edward is a brony
<diddutz> mario_pony: I hope ur talking about a twilight sparkle movie ...
<mario_pony> Jim: *facehoof*
<Dark_Horst> Kazahana, how do i do that?
<Dr_Fumbles> same
<Cypresswolf> Im gonna hit the mechanic shop, then aquire cake. Im going idle for awhile
<Kazahana> http://www.livestream.com/superbrony64
<Dark_Horst> thanks
<Kazahana> ;)
<Dark_Horst> good lord, the quality is horrible
<mario_pony> diddutz: what's so bad about liking twilight?
<lol> buy normal gun man
<NovaMarcellus> anyone else getting terrible lag?
<Dr_Fumbles> There are not enough words to describe how much I love Dead Space
<lol> nope
<Yellowquiet> i dont even get a stream XD
<NovaMarcellus> o there it goes
<lol> dead pace mp preety good
<NovaMarcellus> and now its gone
<dashiee> helloz :)
<Pale_Horse> I'm more a fan of "quieter" survival horror. Like Amnesia or Silent Hill.
<Jim> hi dashiee
*Yellowquiet hugs dashiee
<NovaMarcellus> what is best silent hill game?
<Dr_Fumbles> What difficulty is this on?
<Pale_Horse> Probably 2
<lol> so many nodes
<NovaMarcellus> also which one is silent ponyville based on?
<Pale_Horse> dunno. Never read that one
<diddutz> mario_pony: I have to admit, I never saw any twilight movie but I hate the fact that every (more female) are going crayzay about this movie
<Dr_Fumbles> yeah
<lol> lol
<Kazahana> Twilight Sparkle? :)
<NovaMarcellus> Dr. Fumbles:)
<Dr_Fumbles> This is the skin of a killer! (sparkles like a fairy)
<Dark_Horst> guy went a little hard on the gamma there
<Jim> I would like a Twilight Sparkle movie though
<RainbowDash48> lo, great movie last night
<mario_pony> diddutz: i just watch it foe the cool battle scenes and sometimes for the story my female cousins got me into the whole thing.
<Dark_Horst> who's streaming, btw?
<lol> so low graphics
<NovaMarcellus> Wreck
<Jim> Wrek is streaming I think
<NovaMarcellus> i think
<otakon> I'll be back
<Tacit_Rainbow> >a little hard on the gamma
<Tacit_Rainbow> I get it, Dark_Horst
<RawketLawnchair> This isn't working.
<Pale_Horse> I do wonder now how a Pyramid Head pony would actually 'work'... I mean, how is he supposed to carry the great knife effectively? he can't use his teeth, cause of his mask... and he needs his hooves free to walk....
*String_Shredder breaks The_4th_Wall
<Ziltoidian> magic
<Tovler> oh good, the main room is back
<Jim> But we need that fourth wall!
<Tacit_Rainbow> unicorn
<Dark_Horst> nailt it onto his foreleg
<Jim> He's nice
<Tacit_Rainbow> like all the iimportant ponies
<diddutz> i got no prejudices about guys watching twilight (how could I, i watch mlp O.o) but over the time it started annoying me...
<Dr_Fumbles> Necromorphs are so badass
<RAWRity> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/418739_2820854765836_1392930293_32533731_1746334743_n.jpg

*Yellowquiet hugs everypony
<MrWiggles> Heh...
<lol> lol
*TOY_PON3 hugs Yellowquiet back
<Yellowquiet> next time i gonna use some normal paper
<Pale_Horse> I did always find it wierd that the flamethrower could somehow cut off limbs... :/
<Pale_Horse> I was like "how"?
<NovaMarcellus> tried doing this game with only a plasma cutter and no armor upgrades
<NovaMarcellus> didnt turn out to well
<TOY_PON3> Shit that reminds me I need to work on my OC today or atleast this weekend. for sure

<TOY_PON3> later mario_pony
<Dr_Fumbles> he is on a moon (station)
<Ziltoidian> dead
<Ziltoidian> all dead

<Jim> bye Yellowquiet
<lol> Bye
<Rhymeless_Zebra> later Yellowquiet
<NovaMarcellus> now we can go bannanas!
<Yellowquiet> i WUB you all <3
<Pale_Horse> Slender Pony: Hai guys... Can I be in your movie too?
<pony_6028> Is it a press and hold or keep pressing repeatedly?
<Ingwaz> and now you're screwed, royally
<Jim> How did this happen?
<MrWiggles> I love this part. :D
<lol> lol
<lol> RUN!
<TOY_PON3> and then everyone died
<lol> forest RUN!
<TOY_PON3> hold on Issac!
<Ingwaz> this game is just one big middle finger to the player after another
<MrWiggles> Nom nom nom.
<NovaMarcellus> this would be so much mor epic if it didnt lag every 2 secons
<Ingwaz> you escape a helicopter, barely, and then theres this god awful monster waiting for you
<MrWiggles> Refresh.
<lol> RUN!
<lol> i hate this part
<TOY_PON3> inb4 SB dies :P
<Jim> And then the helicopter comes back
<lol> epic moment
<Ingwaz> oh look, helicopter is back
<lol> in vacum no sound how realistic ^^
<MrWiggles> Huge flaw right there.
<MrWiggles> Explosions dont do shit in space.
<Pale_Horse> that's what we call a bad day.
<Ingwaz> how someone could have such mental fortitude to put up with something like this is just inhumanly possibl
<TOY_PON3> MrWiggles: Exactly
<Dark_Horst> mrwriggles, you are wrong
<NovaMarcellus> one second he was battling on the satalite
<Dr_Fumbles> No other game gives you that bad to worse feeling every 5 mins, except DS 1
<NovaMarcellus> then he was in the room
<pony_6028> Explosions have shockwaves.
<Dark_Horst> what we jsut witnessed was a mass of gas rapidly expanding
<Dr_Fumbles> indeed
<Dark_Horst> SHOCKWAVE!
<pony_6028> SHOCKWAVES DO STUFF
<TOY_PON3> shockwave smockwave
<TOY_PON3> :P
<Pale_Horse> The sun is a miasma, of incandescent plasma....
<pony_6028> EVEN MORE SO IN SPACE WHERE THEIR SPEED AND STRENGTH DOESN'T DECAY
<TOY_PON3> i take it pony_6028 is from space?
<TOY_PON3> :P
<pony_6028> Ofc.
<Jim> Dad, are you space?
<Dark_Horst> now, if you'd blow up a nuke in space, THAT wouldn't do suqad. except death fo radiation and fried digital watches
<pony_6028> Can't have enough spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-
<String_Shredder> dat creepy music
<Jim> Who lit all those candles?
<Dr_Fumbles> The sun is one massive fission reaction (similar to H bomb)
<Krakass> Fusion?
<lol> uep Fusian reactor
<Dr_Fumbles> yah sy
<Dr_Fumbles> lol
<lol> i always make 2 saves
<Pale_Horse> That why burning up all it's other elements and trying to fuse iron is such a big problem for a star.
<Ingwaz> so, what difficulty level is this on?
<Dr_Fumbles> this part is hard
<Jim> oh gawd, what are those?
<Krakass> Dat ITER
<Dark_Horst> aw, i hate those wallclimbers
<Dr_Fumbles> leapers
<lol> when star begin to fuse iron or other metal it blow up in supernova
<Dark_Horst> they make like spiderpigs, except you DIE!
<Dark_Horst> and that has a shockwave becasue it's a mass of gas, rapidly expanding
<Ingwaz> must be on easy, would have expected death by now
<Dr_Fumbles> The difficulty seems embarrassingly low
<Dark_Horst> but if you'd ignite c4 in space oyu wouldn't have a shockwave, because of no gas
<Dr_Fumbles> For my first playthrough, i was on zealot
<Dr_Fumbles> no dlc
<Pale_Horse> well it would'nt be fun to watch if we had to sit through him dyinjg and reloading over and over
<Dr_Fumbles> lol
<diddutz> Isn't it the most silly thing to have so much candles in space, where oxygen is limited?
<Dark_Horst> i also played on medium on my first run. better fort he athmosphere
<Dr_Fumbles> not if you plan to die
<Pale_Horse> Another thing that they actually have way too much of: Space. In space, space on starships would be at an exhorbitant premium. These interiors are way too unrealistically big.
<lol> i hate this little things
<RainbowJack> when did the chat die?
<Dark_Horst> these guys happiley stood in line to get cranium-raped by bats. you think they gonna mind such little problems as oxygen?
<Pale_Horse> it's ironic that when you'r in space, Space is the most valuable thing.
<pony_3099> .
<lol> they like banelings
<Dr_Fumbles> Um... future? seriously
<pony_3099> is the movie done >.<?

<Krakass> Ponies don't do this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGVSIkEi3mM&feature=player_embedded
*Ictiv takes off (magic) fedora, and lays magic staff on the ground as he bows deep before The GhostOfLeslieNielson.

<DainbowRash> It's okay. People are arguing about 1/1/12 anyways.
<MasterBrony> http://dontevenreply.com/view.php?post=77
<Wrek> 05arguing with a mod isnt a battle, its a slaughter.
<pony_5943> MasterBrony: Why? The mods are not smarter or more important than anyone else.
<Yahooz> its asking to be executed
<Ictiv> Wrek: How about Brushing a mod?
*Nittany_Discord releases his llamas.
<MrBen> 08,01Again, if you have any comments, post them in the #babblewithbronies room. Make sure to follow the rules!

*RandomPony attempts to steal a rabbit
*Ictiv brushes Wrek's mane.
<Sundaysmile> Anyone know a cure for sleep deprived eyes?
*Jim is trampled by llamas
<IshBestPony> LOOK OUT THERE ARE LLAMAS!
<Kencolt> The mods are mods, silly. As in, they have thepower over this site. Thus, fighting a mod is akin to spanking a nuke.
<Rare> Btw, nothing against that blurry line, but can we have derpy again?
<pony_666> here a llama, there a llama, llama llama everywhere
<Sundaysmile> they hurt like a sombitch

*Pyrexo Jumps for joy
<unfoundbug> is that what they call it now?
<pony_5943> IshBestPony: The government also has powers over you, but does that mean you just bend over and take everythingin the ass? Well porbably if you're American, but yeah.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14We're gonna need years of therapy for this...
<Ictiv> 11/2/12. The Day of the Llama. NEVER FORGIVE!
<Nittany_Discord> Spanking a nuke: Because you have to touch it just right or it won't blow. XD
<pony_666> mods please play us some of your soothing musical voice
<Sundaysmile> stop with your roofie cocktails
<TWISTeD398> LOL KETCHUP SANDWICH
<IshBestPony> pony_5943 where did the man touch you
<moop> WHY DOES EVERY ONE HATE AMERICAN EOPLE?
<pinkiederp> pony_5943 that's offensive
<RandomPony> I declare this idea can not go wrong
<Princess_Luna> You know @Wrek, you don't have to be mean about being a dictator...
<Kencolt> Well, what I meant is Spanking a nuke-- it won'
<IshBestPony> pony_5943 show me on this doll
<Pyrexo> Play Derpy got soul :D
<pinkiederp> I refuse to be insulted
<Nittany_Discord> But when you hit it, you're going to see some serious sh*t.
<Meanwhile> One of these days it is going to stop burning when I pee...
<Nittany_Discord> I know.

<Pyrexo> Strange voices.
<unfoundbug> 88mph while spanking a nuke? you really will see some serious %^&*
<Kencolt> Well, what I meant is Spanking a nuke-- it won't get you anywhere, has little effect-- and if it does, then it blows up in your face.
<Sundaysmile> some audio?
