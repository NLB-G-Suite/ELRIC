<Invi|omnom> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Invi|omnom> dat bass
<AttacktheAndalite> Hello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Ponies47> Ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Kandarihu> I can tell there must be quite the moodswings in this movie, considering the scope of the TV series it's based on.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03ooh, british video!
<APimpNamedSlickback> Dis Song <3
<APimpNamedSlickback> :'(
<APimpNamedSlickback> Oh my god... :'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wait.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why not save her?
<Meanwhile> Because the attempt would have probably killed her painfully.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, because the only way they could try to revive her would break every bone in her body.
<sub06905> ;__;
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bones grow back together.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> For those who want it, The Last Remnant is like 3 bucks in GmG
<Dark_Horst> what's this?
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, over time, but she'd feel the pain.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For a while.
<twilight_sprinkle> dat spoiler
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not forever.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03SPOILERS
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> this seems weird
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: She'd have probably died in pain from the revival attempt.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What was that Scoots?
<BronyInstrumental> my art is being followed by a whole..... 1 PERSON! duh dunn!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And this shit was sad :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: they may grow back incorrectly. but thats what they said
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: he just mentioned the bones
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It was about some guy who said things to his mom in her deathbed
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's KH1?
<MadSurge> BOOO KINGDOM HEARTS
<Scribble_Ink> Havent played it... Is the first one for ps2 or 1?
<CrimsonPhoenix> PS2
<Meanwhile> Never played Kingdom Hearts.
<Eulshy> i like the memory one
<Scribble_Ink> Should brobly try and find a emu for it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know the first one was acceptable
<Scribble_Ink> probly**
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the second went full retard with the story
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: the first one is a fun action game if you completely ignore the confusing story :D
<Meanwhile> Pfft. "It's fun if you ignore this part" Never spells good.
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: and it became way too simple with the combat
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: Yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> I didn't know that MadSurge
<Kandarihu> This is such a beautiful song.
<twilight_sprinkle> the sanctuary song was even better imo
<Scribble_Ink> 2 things in life i dident belive untill it was released: Peter jackson doing LotR and disney doing cross over with square :)
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: the best part of the game was beating the bonus bosses, literally :D
<Kandarihu> Did any of the Pixar franchises ever get represented in Kingdom Hearts? Or only Disney Classics?
<Meanwhile> If these credits are anything to go by I'd say only Disney.
<Scribble_Ink> Think its only classic
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: as far as I know only classic stuff
<Kandarihu> What about Enix franchises?
<Scribble_Ink> Pony!
<BronyInstrumental> well guys imma get outta here. later y'all
<Eulshy> good song
<Scribble_Ink> Later
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye, BronyInstrumental
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well there was some fina lfantasy stuff
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: nope, they wisely said "don't touch our stuff assholes" :D
<pony_701> finaly ponys :D
<MadSurge> So that Dragon Quest is still seen as a decent RPG series :D
<Borg> :[ funy
<Borg> Nice duds
<Bronysith> all right, what time is star wars tonight?
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, last I knew, Final Fantasy is still the king of the RPG franchises.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,037pm I believe
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: final fantasy 13 is terrible though
<Scribble_Ink> Fallout for me
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And after this, it's time for some creepy shit~
<Meanwhile> Well thanks for the warning Alej.
<Ryunosuke> Kandarihu, that depends on who you ask
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No... I'm serious.
<Kandarihu> They've made some bad installments. 12, I hear was great.
<Ryunosuke> Dragon Warrior is pretty popular as well
<Borg> Erm isn't that Elder scrolls/Fallout
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: some more creepypasts stuff?
<Meanwhile> Five bits says it isn't even that creepy.
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: the best final fantasies were 6 and 7
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: yeah, but the last games weren't as well received, while the last two Dragon Quest are arguably the best of the series
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Somethin' like that~
<Scribble_Ink> Same engine for oblivion as fallout 3 and vegas
<Bronysith> Deus ex is supposedly an amazing rpg
<Bronysith> and it is actually
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: Yeah it's a first person RPG to be exact
<Scribble_Ink> Loved the new Deus ex, a little short though
<killerpony7733> It's a really interesting hybrid
<Ryunosuke> imo, I have not played a bad Dragon warrior game
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: no screamers this time i hope?:P
<Bronysith> im talking about the first deus ex Scribble_Ink
<Borg> Oblivion wasn't one of my favs. Just due to like only 3 voice actors
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I hope!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Scootapasta?
<Bronysith> Borg: skyrim only has 4 voice actors
<killerpony7733> Scribble_Ink: Deus ex short? u srs?
<Borg> See? An improvment?\
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: he is talking about the new one
<Scribble_Ink> I actually missed it, got the first one on steam and gonna give it the time it deserves soon.
<Ryunosuke> liking a game because of VA is not the basis of a good game
*MadSurge is a sucker for screamers
<twilight_sprinkle> oh look its Nova
<Ryunosuke> see FFx/X-2 :)
<Borg> Skyrim improved on the last games voice actors!
<Meanwhile> Ok. I don't know what I'm looking at but it's weird.
<alexxm> i have no idea what this is
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: Still even that one lasted almost 30 hours for me in general
<Bronysith> Borg: with 1 voice actor
<Borg> Yep!
<Invi> a bit quiet
<Borg> *cheap asses*
*Ryunosuke remembers games before there were VA's in them
<MadSurge> ^
<Scribble_Ink> Daggerfall! :D
<Bronysith> Morrowind is amazing

<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: yup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or silent characters.
<AttacktheAndalite> Ohay Gumby X3
<Ryunosuke> the problem with alot of games
<pony_701> morrowind was best elder
<Ryunosuke> is that they are becoming... interactive movies basically
<alexxm> what the hell is gumby
*Borg remembers his first game *Mario Party 2*
<Scribble_Ink> Agree with pony_701
<red_ony> I'm not so sure...I haven't played anything pre morrowind..how bout daggerfall?
<Bronysith> My first game was super mario 64
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some AAA titles are.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That is Igglybuff, i believe
<pony_701> morrowind > oblivion > skyrim
<Ryunosuke> I didnt like oblivion
<Scribble_Ink> Dagger fall was so fun, but sadly i dont think i can handle the grapic today :(
<Borg> Morrowind had a bad engine.
<Bronysith> pony_701: /)
<Bronysith> Borg: nope
<red_ony> morrowind > skyrim > oblivion
<Ponies47> I'm gonna go play TF2 to for bit :P
<Eulshy> Scoot-Scootaloo: It's obviously Mallow
<Bronysith> red_ony: um no
<pony_701> Bronysith: (\
<Bronysith> red_ony: replace oblivion with skyrim
<Scribble_Ink> Daggerfall had one thing i miss in the new games though: Climbing skill.
<AttacktheAndalite> Have fun Ponies47
<Borg> Climbing?
<Bronysith> Scribble_Ink: i enjoy morrowind though...
<red_ony> climbing sounds interesting
<Obsidian> Hello everypony.
<Bronysith> One thing skyrim lacks is....fun
<Scribble_Ink> Yes, you could clim on houses and walls if you were good enough in that skill.
<Borg> I'm more an RTS guy myself /:
<Ryunosuke> but I did like morrowid over skyrim simply due to skills
<Scribble_Ink> climb**
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i had fun.
<red_ony> I love the freedom in morrowing..what the fuck happended to flying and teleportation spells?
<Bronysith> red_ony: ikr
<Bronysith> or spears?
<pony_701> morrowind was best game for that guy faling from the sky with the power jump scrolls
<Bronysith> that was hilarious
<Bronysith> i pissed myself with laughter when that happened
<red_ony> flight of icarus
<Borg> Anyone else like RTS games? Rise of nations, Stonghold Crusaders, LOTR:BFME?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Talking rods.
<Scribble_Ink> Skyrims only problem is the new chracter system. Miss the old one :(
<red_ony> yeah..I love charts
<red_ony> ^^
<alexxm> Bronysith i heard that there was some way to save that guy
<Bronysith> Scribble_Ink: what? skyrim has alot of problems
<Borg> The problem with Skyrim is all the sexual mods
<twilight_sprinkle> Borg: i like stronghold. i remember abusingthe cowboulder bug
<Saturn> 08,01sexual mods?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> can we actualy watch some pony related vids soon
<Bronysith> Borg: the problem with skyrim, IS EVERYTHING
<Scribble_Ink> Do tell
<twilight_sprinkle> Borg: modsa rent a part of the official game..thats like saying the problem with mlp are clopfics
<CK|Catnap> Oh dear, you've awoken Saturn.
<Ryunosuke> Morrowind had ... explicit mods as well
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: no.

<AttacktheAndalite> Hi Malavolent
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i said soon not now
<pony_701> xD yeah some mod makers obviously watched to much hentai
<Eulshy> I wanted donkey kong 64
<Borg> I find that skyrim is ok but is underrated for the current tech.
<MadSurge> You shouldn't have done that Scoot-Scootaloo...
<Bronysith> Borg: what are you talking about? skyrim is the most overrated game of the decade
<Saturn> 08,01Dj_Cyber-4G: well, it depends on what whoever is streaming wants to stream
<Eulshy> duh fuq?
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi Saturn~
<XylemTube> Ban drown
<FlaschenJoe11> What is wrong with his spine?
<Saturn> 08,01Dj_Cyber-4G: we generally only stream ponies on Brony Movie Night
<XylemTube> ben even
<Scribble_Ink> I do love skyrim, but i agree that its overated.
<Borg> I mean underated grapics and NPC engine.
<Saturn> 08,01oh, also, we're streaming Die Hard and Star Wars tonight, iirc
<Bronysith> Scribble_Ink: would you agree it is the most overated game of the decade?
<Meanwhile> Link ran full speed sideways into a low doorframe.
<Borg> As in they such!

<Invi> Saturn ane before, and after and at random times over the week :D
<pony_701> dat noise

<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: is star wars first?
<Shizuka> 13basically.. whoever is streaming gets to stream what they want to
<alexxm> i don't see whats so scary so far just looks glitched to me
<Scribble_Ink> @bronysith no, that would be the Halo games :)
<red_ony> when are you starting with the movies? I hate time difference...
<Dj_Cyber-4G> who is streaming?
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo:
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I Do What I want.avi

<Bronysith> Scribble_Ink: well skyrim has the worst fanboys
<AttacktheAndalite> Scoot-Scootaloo.mp4
<red_ony> its almost 22:00 here
<alexxm> i don't see whats so scary so far just looks glitched to me
<Shizuka> 13this doesn't mean you get to pester the person streaming with requests
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i'm trying to get the Despecialised Editions uploaded for streaming tonight, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to in time
<Bronysith> Scribble_Ink: worst community
<Dj_Cyber-4G> SCOOTALOO HAS A STREAM!
<Bronysith> Saturn: what are you doing here? fix it up please!
<Saturn> 08,01if not, we'll show whatever version SlurryMoon has
<Griffon_Major> Saturn: just as long as we see the movies we wont mind ^^
<Eulshy> fings look normal now
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: currently compressing it down from 6GB...
<Scribble_Ink> Bronysith: I see your point, but still think there is worse :)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Remeber the last guy who pestered me into streaming some dumb anime? Me neither...
<Bronysith> Saturn: despecialized please! those are the movies i watched as a kid
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: exactly
<Borg> I remember this game...I was like 10 when I first played and was clueless.
<Saturn> 08,01if it happens, it happens
<Bronysith> Scribble_Ink: i love dark souls. it weeds out the false gamers
<Eulshy> now its weird
<Borg> I rented it and err...
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn: What are despecialized editions?
<Saturn> 08,01if i can't get it to Slurry in time, we'll just have to make do; at least for the first one
<Saturn> 08,01i'll certainly have the other two uploaded to him in time
<Marx> You shouldn't have done that.
<Bronysith> Saturn: empire strikes back is the one with the least changes
<APimpNamedSlickback> Alright.. O_O
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: youre hardly a calm and collected fan either
<Meanwhile> Und dann you were on fire.
<MadSurge> AND EXPLODE
<Eulshy> BUUUUUUURN

<Meanwhile> Fish link is a fish. Link.
<Borg> Turned into fish man
<Dj_Cyber-4G> honestly im a fimfiction writer so i don't do a lot of PMVs
<MadSurge> Griffon_Major: this is a famous creepypasta on Zelda Majora's Mask, Ben Drowned
<red_ony> I won't be able to go to bed before 4 in the morning with these movies..good thing I haven't got to go to mwork until next week :D
<Eulshy> the brightness is to damn low
<Bronysith> MAJORAS MASK is my favorite zelda game

<Meanwhile> Never played any of the Zelda games.
<Scribble_Ink> Sweet! *getting more beer* Me neither red_ony
<Kandarihu> Is this BenDrowned?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> this is boreing [no offence]
<MadSurge> Did you know fishes could drown?
<alexxm> i think so Kandarihu
<Saturn> 08,01AttacktheAndalite: someone went and painstakingly snipped together, colour corrected, and fixed bits from all the released editions of the Original Trilogy to make them as close to the original theatrical releases (which have *not* been released in colour corrected, fixed up forms yet) as possible
<Marx> You drowned as a zora...
<Scribble_Ink> fail
<Bronysith> Saturn: han is the only one to shoot!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And then Ben died
<Meanwhile> Ben Drowned.

<Meanwhile> Dj_Cyber-4G: Then go amuse yourself.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That's the sound of Aliens doing what they want!
<killerpony7733> Dj_Cyber-4G: Then do something else to not be bored,
<Saturn> 08,01of course, the order in which to watch them is: IV, V, II, III, VI, with I as an optional "kiddie" extra
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i do. there are only 3 star wars movies though

<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: II and III aren't *that* bad. certainly not as bad an incongruent as I. they still kinda work within the framework of the original trilogy.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> APimpNamedSlickback: lol who knows

<MadSurge> Dat Requiem for a Dream
<Borg> Yup
<red_ony> was the best thing about a movie I didn't like...if I only remembered the name^^
<Saturn> 08,01it's hard fact that the best Trek films, in order, were: 2, 4, and 8
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> its obvious Aliens are testing our reactions
<Bronysith> Saturn: as long as you accept that there are only 3 star wars movies...
<Shizuka> 13and nemesis

<LilB> and hi Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 :)
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: I use it from time to time to empthasize a point else not really a big user of it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Shizuka: yup
<Shizuka> 13i'd rank nemesis higher than insurrection easily
<Meanwhile> Oh mah gawd we get it. /)Aliens(\
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> there was no reason for more Alien movies after Alien2
<Kandarihu> I meant as being rude to him.
<Marx> Captain Olimar!
<Borg> OK I think they are realzies now
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: they were both basically the same film, though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really think the China one is a rocket.
<Kandarihu> And... I just crossed the line again.
<Saturn> 08,01and nemesis had more pointless sequences, and writing wankery that was trying to *blatantly* copy Wrath
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Ah i know what you mean
<Borg> Stop it we need no mo proof!
<Eulshy> If those were really aliens we would already know, i mean how many satalites do we have orbiting the earth?
<thisguy> ooh, purty :3
<Borg> No mo proof!
<String_Shredder> lol, Russia
<Borg> No mo proof!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> That looks like a flare

<alexxm> rockey
*AttacktheAndalite facepalms from all the fake alien lights
<killerpony7733> Fun fact:We are in such a big universe we being the only intelligent life is pure stupid

<MadSurge> Eulshy: buuuut OBVIOUSLY aliens have undetectable technology to travel in space! *derp*
<thisguy> i think it's just celestia visiting earth :P
<red_ony> If the universe is really as wast as we think it is probable that there are other life forms out there..and also very unlikely that we ever get to meet them..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think that's a Soyuz rocket.
<Meanwhile> How long is this?
<LilB> Fun Fact: Professors in the 3rd Reich also worked in the Field of Levitation, the "Objects" were Bell-shaped, most of these Professors were brought to the USA where they continued their experimets, they kept the bell shape, mut made it more flat (the common UFO -shape) teh first UFO-Sigts were spottet near their Research-Labs
<MadSurge> Oh my god, it's KERBALS!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hell, he's using footage I've seen of a rocket launch and calling it a UFO.
<Meanwhile> Um...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> > Aliens come to greet us, > Lets take them prisoners and disect them to look at their organs
<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: seems legit
<Eulshy> Madsurge: If people really wanted to know if there were aliens, why the hell don't they get in a helicopter really faat and go look at the shit
<Scribble_Ink> Man he is a bad acter
<MadSurge> He was about to break into laugh
<Kandarihu> I'd assume aliens are watching our TV and our transmissions, and are not happy with what they're seeing.
<alexxm> worst actor ever

<sub06905> SpadeMagnes[R]: have fun :)
<Ann> Is this that Gary's Mod I hear so much about?
<rainbow> rainbow: i can talk to myself
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: why?
<owlicious> Ann: no
<owlicious> this is Kerbal Space Program
<killerpony7733> Ann: No it's kerbal space program
<Derpdash> Ann: No its Kerbal Space Program
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought of meeting up, but I don't think your parents would approve.
<Ann> Ah, well thanks for that then. *thumbs up*
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: We said the same thing :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Of course they wouldn't, some random adult just taking their kid away
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Exactly.
<Very_Silly_Filly> That's how *ahem* bad things happen kids
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I think I found a brony in Cairne(My WoW realm)
<Derpdash> killerpony7733: Bronylepathy maybe?
<Derpdash> :P
<cratorkid> yea... Nittany_Discord my mums really wierd , not to mention she called me a fag once .. then i laughed at her
<Meanwhile> Very_Silly_Filly: But think of all the free candy!
<Ann> We're everywhere, lurking, waiting, biding...
<Derpdash> c
<Very_Silly_Filly> Meanwhile: Candy Schmandy, it's all about tea and cakes
<owlicious> Nittany_Discord seems like a pretty cool guy. He's mighty and doesn't afraid of anything.
<Ann> I love tea and/or cakes!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I wish I could find a shiny pokemon for once
<FlaschenJoe11> What is this going to be? A Firecracker?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm afraid of employment.
<Malmortius> Hi guys. Joke woke up, i love you all. <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not joking.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I hate that fear.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm British, it's compulsiary to like tea and cakes. If you don't, you get lasered
<rainbow> i found a pink rabbit thing... once
<owlicious> oops, forgot about that
<rainbow> rather than white
<Meanwhile> Very_Silly_Filly: True facts.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't want to sit on my ass and make $0.
<Ann> So, what is the objective of this game. To launch things into space sucessfully?
<Chrysalis> Very_Silly_Filly SHHHHH were not supposed to tell them about the lasers
<Ann> And work isn't that bad.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Chuggaconroy's shiny encounter was unbelievable
<AttacktheAndalite> Nittany_Discord: Have you tried a trade or something similar like tutoring?
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: If your any good with metal I can get you a job in the foundry with me.
<cratorkid> Nittany_Discord: still some money is better then no money
<alexxm> work is good it gets you money
<Very_Silly_Filly> Chrysalis: Well, at least I kept the starcannon research secret....oh crap, there goes my development secret
<Ann> Trades are where it's at right now. The work force is hurting hard for tradesmen/women. They're rather rewarding.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Liokin-Bot: I have no experience working with metal. I doubt they'll take me.
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: The work is pretty casual and in about 2 weeks i'll possibly be meeting up with AttacktheAndalite -lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He was in the Burned Tower looking for a koffing, and A. first encounter was said pokemon, and B. It was shiny
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Have some fun with thermite. You'll learn a great deal
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: Hmm....Well I could probably train you its not to hard. As long as your not squeemish around extreme heat.
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin-Bot: that's IF I can. I have school 3 nights a week, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
<Liokin-Bot> AttacktheAndalite: Yup.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Liokin-Bot: Extreme heat doesn't bug me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How many hours do you work a week?
<Eulshy> My Cleffa won't listen to me
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: Well it depends really.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Liokin-Bot: That job would be perfect for me :C Not only am I good at product design, but I'm used to constant temperatures of 30-40 degrees c
<Eulshy> Thats what i get for trading
<Chrysalis> Sumica http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.net/kerbal-space-program-mods first one is a nice set
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I still wonder what this woman is doing in this trailer in this forest
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I took Radiative Transfer. Know how heat works.
<Calcos> Any Maine, USA Bronies in here?
<Chrysalis> oh....
<rainbow> yes
<Chrysalis> hmm, wonder how easy to edit the files are
<rainbow> jk lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean what is that woman doing alone in that forest
<ponibas> Calcos, we've been over this.. no bronies in Maine
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: My set hours are 6. 9:00 to 3:00
<Calcos> ponibas: ...but I'm here...
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: But I can get called in to work anywhere from 24 hours to 3 days
<ponibas> lies :p
<Biglaw> So, who's streaming again?
<MegaMoonShine> Biglaw: Sumi is
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: But my pay sir. Well I can deffinetly compete with some doctors :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Biglaw: Sumi is
<ponibas> inc spam of yays
<Biglaw> ah, okay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,019 PM is not a bad start time.
<Biglaw> I remember when Sumica made the Space Drill of Death
<rainbow> woaha
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But you worked 3 days in a row sometimes?
<sweetiebot> yay
<Marx> That configuration reminds me of Boilogic Space Labs.
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: Yup, provides me with plenty sleep in hours.
<Malmortius> Hey guys, i was bored so i created this in spore. Its mah spaceship =D http://www.pictars.com/users/blessedspirit/Banshee.jpg
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is there a point to this woman npc in the Lostlorn forest in my Pokemon Black game?
<Very_Silly_Filly> If someone ever asks who's streaming, noone answer and let the streamer just say (I am) Just I am. I would be the perfect trolling mechanism
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0172-hr work day?
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: Yeah. But you get payed for 72 hours worth of work.
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: And the starting wage is 14.75$
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That doesn't make sense.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't even think that's legal.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You can't work someone for 72 hours.
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: -lol its very legal.
<turtlegod98> yay
<Chrysalis> Sumica once it finishes updating to .16 i should be able to mod the decoupler for larger parts
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: There are beds here.
<sweetiebot> *yay*
<turtlegod98> ok then
<Biglaw> Sumica makes sense, and good luck with your Rocket.... Thing
<Derpdash> but not the laws of Pinkie Pie?
<Liokin-Bot> Sumica: -lol well 72 hours of pay says I can do it! >:3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WELP
<noname> :D
<Marx> Oh whoops.
<ponibas> dat worked
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: What about the army? They work for days on end.
<Biglaw> XD
<sweetiebot> *yay*
<Marx> Exactly.
<MegaMoonShine> O_______0
<sweetiebot> *yay*
<Eulshy> boom

<MegaMoonShine> It's still going :D
<turtlegod98> millions of dollars down the shit hole.
<Eulshy> That rocket is a trooper
<Ann> Critical zeros >.<
<Biglaw> Well, that escalated quickly
<Chrysalis> that engine is rather expectant
<sweetiebot> It's a myhstery
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Bisharp is best pokemon
<Derpdash> He thinks he can x3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GG Sumica.
<Ann> That looked like North Korea's launch attempt.
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<sweetiebot> *yay*

<Biglaw> Someday I want a voice changer so I can sound like GLaDOS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> flutter_spin: that feel
<Derpdash> Question: What's big and white and can kill you if it falls from a tree?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Liokin-Bot: Where do you live?
<owlicious> Derpdash: snow?
<Ann> What... what are those? Space bananas?
<sweetiebot> twitchy tail!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Liokin-Bot: To be honest, the job doesn't sound that bad.
<Liokin-Bot> Nittany_Discord: Hopefully anyways.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Keep in mind Fusion Bolt is the signature move of Zekrom and Flare is the signature move of Reshiram

<Calcos> Nittany: Like JonTron says: They all had a collective brain anyurism, singularity was reached, and CBFD was brought into the world.
<alexxm> how did he survive
<MegaMoonShine> Are those things in the background trees or something?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lil_B: Gee, I wonder why? *Looks at poo, tits, gore, swearing* Hmm, no idea

<otakon> Firelight: Sarcasm*

<HungryForChicken> gasp* sumica is racist
<Firelight> Meanwhile: And again with the corrections guys?
<Meanwhile> otakon: I saw that.
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: I understand 100% of it :F

<MadSurge> Oh, this
<MaxTheBrony> :D this one again !
<otakon> but I'm cool with that.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And kidnapping luna!

<Zanon> she kidnapped me
<Derpdash> ....Youd think celestia would be pissed about receiving the same damn picture 52 times now?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Mists of Pandaria is gonna be awesome
<Sumica> 00,10it's not raceisim if you hate every one otakon
<HungryForChicken> is that luuna?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: it'll still sell well though, plus Path Of Exile is coming out.

<Lil_B> Derpdash did you just saw the picture on memebase?
<turtlegod98> what video is this called? I MUST know.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well that's how i learn to program, screw things up until you figure out how they work :p
<Sumica> 00,10some day I may get sick of this video

<CriticKitten> Sumica: I never will.
<ponibas> lol
<MadSurge> Sumica: someday? :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Very_Silly_Filly: Did they stop playing because of the DRM?
<Fisheh_Fish> God damn power's gonna go out! O.o
<kirz> 8,6I saw you mention the line layer earlier, sai has 2 types of layers, one for bitmap, one for vectors
<Jim> Time consuming, but it works
<otakon> Fisheh_Fish: shit man!
<StinkomanFan> No, seriously, Luna's KILLING children! and none of you seem to care!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats so bad about DRM?
<Fisheh_Fish> :c
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm sorry, I must goggle that MLG phrase
<Very_Silly_Filly> :P
<otakon> Fisheh_Fish: get to a generator!
<kirz> 8,6different options pop up depending on which you create
<ponibas> Lil_B, not entirely true.. Acitvision has hastened production on a few projects
<Firelight> *Sigh* I need some pings to Annoy to get this song out of my head...
<Ann> I wasn't unhappy with D3, it just seemed to fall victim to overhype. I mean, don't get me wrong there's a lot I don't like about it, but it's still a good game.
<Sumica> 00,10I see now killing
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh, Digital rights, derp
<Bronysith> and i am back
<ponibas> ()*@$(*@&#%(
<Jim> welcome back
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: basically it's measures to lock games so they can't be modded, copied and you have to go through stupid hoops just to play it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Digital Rights: You have none as a gamer.
<Derpdash> umm...what am i watching?
<Bronysith> i am so FUCKING PSYCHED
<ponibas> brb, grabbing my glock
<Cypresswolf> This scene makes me think of Storm of the Century
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You don't even own the game.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ever happen to notice that every new MMO that comes out people say its gonna kill off WoW?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> saw that now one allow me for lines and fine stuff :p the other one is for coloring stuff
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nah, they stopped playing because the loot system is very fucked up
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i think
<Very_Silly_Filly> And a few other reasons
<SirGanjalf> SpadeMagnes[R]: yep
<Firelight> Lets Hear The Yay Beverly Hill Cops Theme song Remix.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It gets annoying
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lets face it, Blizzard are screwed if they do not get their shit together soon
<Bronysith> i am so happy
<turtlegod98> THIS WAS A REALLY GREAT SONG!
<Cypresswolf> Stephen King, with the guy and the cane - "Give me what I want, and I'll go away"
<red_ony> SpadeMagnes[R]: Haven't heard that in a few years actually^^
<Bronysith> watching my fav movies the next fe3w days!
<ponibas> I love the combat and looks of TERA
<Bronysith> YES
<Firelight> Le' Movie.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yay, movie time
<MadSurge> :O
<Fou_Lou> damnit
<Bronysith> TIME FOR IT
<Ann> Well, there's a lot of games you 'don't own'. It's their answer to piracy. Not the best answer but it's one. And as far as it goes in terms of profit, it works.
<turtlegod98> wait, what?
<StinkomanFan> THE CHILDREN FELL TO THERE DEATHS!

<MadSurge> Goodnight guys, see you in 7 hours. I gotta sleep!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SpadeMagnes[R]: i do
<ponibas> TERA is something that any race cacn play any class, and they all start in the same area, no having to run for 30 minuters to get to a diffe starting sone
<Ann> Aren't 98% of all MMO's Korean?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> MadSurge: Dream of Ponies
<SirGanjalf> Ir's LA

<Very_Silly_Filly> Ann: No shit :P
<Firelight> Dinner...
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[R]: Quench.
<Calcos323> SpadeMagnes[R]: because people always go toward the lowest common denominator

<Firelight> Dolphin Frosting? WHat?1
<Ann> Die Hard Max
<SirGanjalf> ^Die Hard
<HungryForChicken> what is this movie about?
<CriticKitten> And the combat is honestly inferior to GW2's. So there's really no reason anyone should put money into TERA. :P
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<Calcos323> Very_Silly_Filly: Funny way to say Fighting Games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SpadeMagnes[R]: It's simple but fun.
<MaxTheBrony> Allright
<Very_Silly_Filly> Unless they have played CoD and they'll be like "I'm not playing this, it doesn't have killstreaks or good graphics'
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Simple butt fun?
<Ann> It's about Dying Hard

<Calcos323> Very_Silly_Filly: I was talking more about GOOD Fighting Games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think TF2 and L4D2 are better MP games, but they are harder to get into.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> SpadeMagnes[R]: they were a little late adding the Pandas to impress me
<Very_Silly_Filly> MK is good
<otakon> Dovah: the first

<Very_Silly_Filly> SpadeMagnes[R]: I've known that forages
<Calcos323> Very_Silly_Filly: No it isn't, it was only popular because it had blood. Nothing more. The same still rings true today

<Derpdash> Dat bear
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Argyle son of Argul
<Calcos323> Very_Silly_Filly: Same thing. It was a simple game with no depth. Street Fighter will always be superior.
<Prick> well ya back in the first war there was that panda monk guy that helped the warchief i think it was the 2nd warchief cant remember

<Ann> Raid is that stuff they use to kill bugs
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> 10-25 people in a single dungeon vying for loot Nittany_Discord
<Kandarihu> This MMO market is pretty disfunctional. World of Warcraft is the game that half of the MMO makers strive to emulate. World of Warcraft is a game that, anecdotally, seems to be the game that everyone wants to quit. And not in favor of any of it's clones.
<StinkomanFan> In Japan KFC is considered a traditional Christmas dinner
<Very_Silly_Filly> Raid is my EXDH

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Vordox: I see you have no patience
<Fou_Lou> StinkomanFan: because of space problems
<ponibas> thats fun
<red_ony> Dark_Horst: In the German dub, the names and backgrounds of the German-born terrorists were changed into English forms (mostly into their British equivalents, with the exception of Marco and Franco, who retained their Italian and French nationalities respectively): Hans became Jack, Karl became Charlie, Heinrich turned into Henry. In the scene where John is writing down the names of the terrorists, a voiceover in the German version
<Ann> You really do love your watch Saturn
<red_ony> oh shit..sorry bout that

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Saturn: I saw him first
<red_ony> a voiceover in the German version says "I'm gonna call you Hans and Karl, just like the two evil giants in the fairy tale" while referring to them as Jack and Charlie later. The new background depicts them as some internationally organized terrorists having gone freelance and for profit rather than ideals.[21]
<ponibas> I may or may not have my Nokia 100 laying about someplace
<Ponies47> Guns guns guns guns!
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: For example yes

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist is most moist pony.
*GabeMoist dusts Nittany_Discord
<Sumica> 00,10would be intersting to see if it can be made to just track otakon kicks
<Calcos323> Nittany_Discord: That makes me moist.
<otakon> Sumica: lovely idea.....
<SirGanjalf> dat MP5
<Kandarihu> Freefall29, only if they're fully playable.
<GarrettBrony> Ann caller id ruined Ferris Buellers Day off
<ponibas> we need a script to keep track of haw many times the mods get kciked for not +o
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: the important thing is just to broaden your tongue to prevent air escaping to the sides
<XylemTube> GO didn't get any MP5 love :(
<GarrettBrony> its a lie
<Sumica> 00,10yay
<SirGanjalf> riiight...
<GabeMoist> ponibas, another excellent suggestion
<Alchemist> doesnt matter, they ont use the aiming sights. EVER.
<StinkomanFan> NOW I HAVE A SWEET HAIRCUT, HOHOHO
<Calcos323> I promise I won't hurt you...BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG
<red_ony> it's a trap!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Troll Hard
<Lil_B> Alchemist I think a good example would be a combination between an rolling "r" and an "h" (as in hallo)
<Meanwhile> Rule this.
*ponibas pulls tripper
<ponibas> ...
<SlurryMoon> 3coolio
<Sumica> 00,10well there goes all the mp5 ammo
<BronyInstrumental> hey guys. i finished the math segment, so i figured 'that's enough for one day' :)
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<Kandarihu> That gives me an idea. Who would be a better company to make an officially licensed FiM game than Valve?
<MaxTheBrony> hmm
<ponibas> which sucks cuz he uses a 9mm too, so could use the ammo
<red_ony> BronyInstrumental: Good thinking!
<Sumica> 00,10DickJenson would have killed em
<Calcos323> ded
<MaxTheBrony> Kandarihu: tricky question
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ded
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Sure, jump on top of him... you should have shot him in the leg.... :P
<GabeMoist> Kandarihu, will it be a trilogy?
<SirGanjalf> neck = broken
<Calcos323> PaladinDrakkenWolf: hivemind
<XylemTube> lol he ded
<ponibas> i'd have shot him in the head while the gun was three
<Fou_Lou> aww hes already ded
<GarrettBrony> I am Still waiting for Valve to Release Chompski : Ultimate Badass
<Kandarihu> GabeMoist, you know Valve doesn't do trilogies. It would be a Duology.
<Ann> 'Damn, should have just shot him'
<Freefall29> GabeMoist: silly, valve can't count to three
<PonySpawn> I'm going to give that kill to gravity.
<Alchemist> ponibas: caliber in itself is not sufficient. You have to have the same cartridge size.
<Sumica> 00,10all that security and they dont have a glass relocker?
<Narolas> Why do they always have to add stupid sound effects to computers in movies ?
<Ponies47> brb
<Narolas> A computer doesn't do a sound every time you press a button, jeez
<PinkiePieYoshi64> "Ah-ah-ahh, you didn't say the Magic word.... Ha-ha -hat, You din't say the Magic word..."
<Ann> Because it's high tech!
<StinkomanFan> NOW I HAVE A WALLET, HOHOHO
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Sumica: they have a huge fricken metal relocker
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because it's cool.
<Kandarihu> Narolas, it's the coconut effect, I think.
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: i think the mp5 uses the same parabellum ammo than a g17
<Freefall29> if you want a trilogy. have it mlp:fim, mlp:fim episode 1, and mlp:fim episode 2 as the final episode of the trilogy
<ponibas> Alchemist, please don't get started.. it's a movie.. and I am very verse in the differnt types of 9mm ammo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It would be funny if it did Narolas
<Fou_Lou> Narolas: I have no idea. But reminds me of cellphones
<Lil_B> His had snapped bad, his neck went crack, Punk********** ain't worth the slap
<XylemTube> yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: so if he had a glock, that would be possible
<Narolas> I would get annoyed very quickly Nittany_Discord :p
<GarrettBrony> GabeMoist I am Still waiting for Valve to Release Chompski : Ultimate Badass
<red_ony> this looks save
<Sumica> 00,10clever bruce is clever

<SirGanjalf> Where is Harvey Dent?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Banned from the party.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Perma-ban at that.

<XAX|MW3> Modern Winslow 3
<red_ony> Do cops in the US actually work alone all the time?
<Ann> Shit, a code two! This is serious!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> 74 cents for gas
<Calcos323> 74 cents...
<red_ony> I mean go on patrol?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Holy shit. Those gas prices!
<Kandarihu> red_ony, I don't think so.
<Calcos323> Boy, have times changed

<Dark_Horst> he HAS to hear that
<StinkomanFan> I prefer Black Cop from Clue
<SirGanjalf> PaladinDrakkenwolf: Good times
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Sure you see flashes on top of the building...
<AttacktheAndalite> 74 cents for gas. SWEET JEEBUS
<Ann> I know eh, 77cents, hellz yeah
<Biglaw> Calcos323: the movie was made in the 90's
<PinkiePieYoshi64> but you cant hear gunshots?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, they should replace that scene with the flower shop scene from the room.
<Ann> For premium!
<Ann> By the gods
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> PinkiePieYoshi64: not to mention it must echo
<fluffle_puff> probably not in big cities
<Calcos323> Biglaw: 1988, actually, but times have still changed.
<Ann> Serious face
<Biglaw> Calcos323 yup, and the price of everyhting revolves around gas
<PinkiePieYoshi64> IKR? lol
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord Hi doggie
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<GarrettBrony> AttacktheAndalite now I know this isn't a real life portrayal of life. 74 cents gas. come on

<FillyFlam> So much love~
<Ann> Damn stright it's important :p
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord ... now I have 2 bones...
<AttacktheAndalite> GarrettBrony: Unfortunately, it's not true. But on the other hand, it's good that it's not true because the tankers would have to be at the tanks every day and those trucks can't punch 100mph with a flammable liquid insie them
<StinkomanFan> ALL THIS WUB SAVED UP FOR NOTHING
<Ann> straight*.. wait, that's ow you spell that right?
<StinkomanFan> ALL THIS WUB, RAINBOW STALIN

<GarrettBrony> Spoilers the NExt Hostige Hans Gruber kills is Dumbledore
<Dark_Horst> i mean, seriously, how do you get heizehaus? do they say heating house in english?
<SirGanjalf> I just don't know why it has to be used in every video game trailer nowadays.
<Dark_Horst> is that even a word?
<AttacktheAndalite> GarrettBrony: That's a spoiler for those who haven't read the HP series
<Ann> Hmm, well this seemed like a good idea at the time
<Liokin-Bot> Calcos323: in the words of teh spy. "Ahahaha, YOU SUCK!"

<Calcos323> Liokin_Bot: That's the thing. I have looked for the good stuff, and I can safely conclude that it doesn't exist

<ponibas> XylemTube, no, like any music.. there is good and bad
<Vordox> Is that a Steyer Rifle?
<Ann> That's a better combo Attack
<Calcos323> Liokin_Bot: TF2 went down the drain as soon as they started fucking with the balance by adding new weapons
<AttacktheAndalite> Die Hard and the Deathly Halllows Part 2
<Reikim> Afternoon, everyone. What are you all up to?
<DocSane> Die Hard?

<Reikim> Objections?
<Kandarihu> But this is getting repetitive.
<Ponies47> Fou_Lou: If you knew how much I have played in trhe past 2 weeks and in total -_-
<Ann> Oh god, what have I started?!
<AttacktheAndalite> Harry Potter and the Fifth Element
<Lil_B> That wasn't native german :/
<SirGanjalf> Life Free or Die Harry
<RivaLz> nobody in German would ever say "Mach los" -_-
<Meanwhile> Overruled.
<Kandarihu> x y 2: x Harder.
<Calcos323> Liokin_Bot: You're some random dude that probably lives hundreds, if not thousands of miles away. Like that means anything to me.
<Fou_Lou> Ponies47: how much?
<DocSane> Ah well, just wanted to see what was playing. Need to watch other things tonight.
*ponibas blames Ann
<Reikim> Star Wars. I'm guessing we're talking originals, because prequels would generate a lot of controversy.
<Liokin-Bot> Calcos323: You know. Your a pain in the neck.
<Dark_Horst> just as nobody speaking english would ever say "make go"
<fluffle_puff> Carl Winslow, Is this Family Matters the movie?
<Calcos323> Liokin_Bot, Likewise, bro
<Liokin-Bot> Calcos323: But ill be damned if I wouldnt take a bullet for ya bro.
<Dark_Horst> the translater deserves a smack upside the head
<Reikim> No, I was asking for objections. To see if anyone had any.
<AttacktheAndalite> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Sixth Sense
<Ann> Stupid cop is stupid
<SirGanjalf> Harry Wars: Voldemort Strikes Back
<Reikim> If I was objecting I'd yell OBJECTION
<Calcos323> Liokin_Bro: ...you know, I like you. A lot.
<Reikim> in my best Phoenix Wright voice.
<Ponies47> Fou_Lou: IDK. Haven't been keeping track. Can't look now I'm on a computer with no Steam :$
<StinkomanFan> You know, my little brother met a girl obsessed wqith HArry Potter and was assigning her class to various houses
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst and the Actors for not correctim them :/
<Vordox> "THERE ARE TERRORIST INSIDE?"
<Ann> Just shoot at the cop.
<Vordox> "Go check it"
<Ann> He'll call for backup
<Vordox> "ok"
<Vordox> DERP
<Meanwhile> Any objections are overruled by default.
<Liokin-Bot> Calcos323: -lol just cause I disagree with you doesnt mean I dont have your back.
<Kandarihu> It was funny when it took me by surprise. When we were watching The Naked Gun, and Queen Elizabeth II appeared, somepony blurted out Queen Elizabeth II: Queen Harder.
<StinkomanFan> When she got to my Little Brother you know what she told him?
<AttacktheAndalite> Harry Potter Episode II: The Death Star of Secrets
<FlareChaser> Came here to find Valor...can't find him, weird.
<GarrettBrony> Harry Potter : and the Sixth Sense of the Fifth Element in the Chamber of Secrets Lil_B
<ponibas> Ponies47, go to the steam website and look up your profile
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: and the writer, for not noticing in the first place
<RX-78-LazyBot> It would be hillarious if the prequel movies were streamed. The level of butthurt would be MASSIVE.
<Calcos323> Liokin_Bot: Hence the reason I like you so damn much.
<Meanwhile> Anyone objecting to the overruling of the objections is overruled as well.
<Liokin-Bot> Calcos323: -lol /)

<Lil_B> Schieß DEN Fenster?!
<JackofApples> Reikim: What's cheaper then that?
<Kandarihu> Calcos323, are you quitting cold-turkey or reducing your usage gradually?
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: i know man, i knwo
<red_ony> dat german grammar
<otakon> Why didn't he say it in German?
<derpy_pony> I liked the japanese poster subtitle..."unwilling hero...he has no shoes!"
<Fou_Lou> a common mistake ^-^
<Reikim> JackofApples: I mean, it's cheaper to send them to the stormtroopers than to give them any sort of REAL training.
<Calcos323> Kandarihu: Cold turkey. I don't have any cigs on me for that reason.
<Eddmario> twilight_sprinkle: Have you seen the version that came out when Toonami was still on the air? THAT version is good.
<Ann> That's exactly the clone wars I'm talking about.
<Lil_B> otakon he dit... and he said it wrong...
<Vordox> INFINITE AMMO GLITCH
<Ann> There... are other animated ones?

<Eddmario> twilight_sprinkle: You should be able to fid them online, as each episode was only about 5 minutes loong
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I hear that if you gradually reduce your smoking patterns, the craving won't be as bad.
<derpy_pony> the only man who spoke a decent german was the one at the e-box at the start
<Ann> Ah, I like to think I have good taste in animation :p
<Eddmario> *long
<twilight_sprinkle> dramatic german
<JackofApples> The GT Clone Wars is only awesome for the Force Power abuse and the other awesome moments by Lightsaber people.

<Calcos323> twilight_sprinkle: Just let go. Savor the moment...Give in.
<otakon> Ann: you should be able to find it there
<derpy_pony> just shoot one in the face
<Ann> Ah, thanks man. *bookmarked*
<Thrackerzod> RaveBrony holy shit
<otakon> Ann: play Skyrim?
*twilight_sprinkle runs from Calcos323
<derpy_pony> you get used to it
<RaveBrony> Thrackerzod: Ikr?

<JackofApples> Ah, John Macclane, one of the LOL 90s action heroes.

<Vordox> JackofApples: 90s?
<derpy_pony> the duke was cooler
<Sonicboom> Ummm
<otakon> Ann: Dawnguard is pretty good, really more of the same.
<Kandarihu> Besides. it's pretty simple to tell who's going to die in Samurai Jack. Humans or other living beings survive, no matter what. Robots ALWAYS die violently, no matter what.
<otakon> Thrackerzod: agreed.
<Sonicboom> Hello
<JackofApples> Yes.
<JackofApples> The 90s.

<fluffle_puff> that green screen
<CriticKitten> WAT
<Ann> So that's why people were smarter back then o.O
<Calcos323> "I can live with that"
<GarrettBrony> did it occur to anymore in this film that the should call upon the seaponies? Ann
<JackofApples> :[ Indeed, for the WAT. And...okay, ah don't remember an' yes seaponies.
<TheHoodyNinja> lol GarrettBrony
<Calcos323> GarrettBrony: Yeah, it's clear that they are in distress.
<Ann> The seaponies, why didn't I think of that?
<Vordox> Mica: Love that pony adieunce. :P
<RaveBrony> Oh you agents... x_(\
<Ann> Oop, no more radio.
<Narolas> ow
<Sumica> 00,10it's noting like waht you make Vordox but it works
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Ouch, that's gotta hurt
<Kandarihu> Ann, the media here is screwed up, though
<GarrettBrony> Shoo be doo shoop shoop be doo mutha fukas
<Calcos323> Vordox: I'm surprised that they aren't cowering because of the violence.
<BronyInstrumental> doing homework all day and watching movies to nearly 2AM is reeealy tiring. my eyes are burning
<Vordox> Sumica: It works cause it works. :)
<Ann> Oh, oh yeah.
<JackofApples> Cause they do!
<derpy_pony> stfu woman
<Thrackerzod> this scene with nothing but the pony theme playing
<Ann> It's a pretty common element in movies though for media to be a plot device like this.
<red_ony> BronyInstrumental: Are you in the UK?
<Calcos323> Get back to the kitchen
<fluffle_puff> next up rape
<Syn_Virtu> lol
<Vordox> DAT CHICKEN FIGHT

<Ann> They're very polar.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I'm Back! And I bought TWINKIES!!!
<RaveBrony> ded
<Vordox> And so he is so dead that guy Mica. :P
<GarrettBrony> Thrackerzod given the time period the G1 theme I presume
<Ann> Rape, it's suprise sex essentially.
<Lil_B> be polite to Kidnappers and Gangsters... they are doing this for a living too :(
<Thrackerzod> Vordox Scootaloo fight?
<Calcos323> So many UK Bronies in this chat
<XylemTube> suprise sex isint always rape
<Vordox> Thrackerzod: XD If Bruce was Scoot-Scootaloo...
<Ann> It's a trap!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat low altitude flying! :O
<derpy_pony> he has fun, idiot
<Ponies47> I'm American :3
<derpy_pony> don't spoil it

<TheHoodyNinja> Dark_Horst: got blowded up
<Vordox> That was a AP thick Pierce.. That's NOT A GUN
<Ann> Suddenly a Desert Eagle
<GarrettBrony> i forgot that this takes place on Christmas Eve
<Kandarihu> And it seems to be a pretty common element on the internet now for half of the people here to go through Fox News Derangement Syndrome whenever the FOX logo appears on the screen.
<derpy_pony> christian day
<Vordox> Ann: Oh that explains it :P
<Lil_B> dat bad aim
<GarrettBrony> than santa lands on the the roof
<JackofApples> LOL, Fox News Derangement Syndrome! :D
<PinkiePieYoshi64> FBI Aiming = Only in Amareica
<Ann> Fox news is a pretty big joke in general. I know news is partisan but damn.
<Calcos323> I fucking LOVE the music in this movie
<GarrettBrony> fnds
<Vordox> Inb4 Spine crack
<Ann> Yank news is painfully partisan sometimes. Though people take their satire too seriously sometimes.
<noname> what are you doing john
<derpy_pony> what is the second movie this night?
<Vordox> BYE HANZ
<Ann> How the fuck to you get into that shit John
<red_ony> I do not get Us news...so imbalanced...
<JackofApples> Indeed, unfortunately. Satire is practically dead thanks to nopony knowing the difference and all that...
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Jump!
<GarrettBrony> epic
<Thrackerzod> dat slomo
<Kandarihu> Ann, you think FOX News is partisan, try looking at CNN from a conservative point of view, or at BBC or Reuters from an Israeli point of view.
<Vordox> HAI FEDS
<derpy_pony> your gods will not help you, american
<TheHoodyNinja> bewm
<Meanwhile> Bamf.
<Ann> The BBC is pretty good for the most part.
<Thrackerzod> michal bay has a orgasmim
<PinkiePieYoshi64> LIKE A BOSS!
<Dark_Horst> ouch
<Vordox> FUCK YOU GLASS
<Ann> Oh yeah, I know what you mean. Canadian news is, all of it, utterly Liberal biased.
<Calcos323> That is, without a doubt, one of the Top 10 greatest explosions in cinema history
<TheHoodyNinja> ouch
<fluffle_puff> Damn it all, I need a Twinkie now!
<RaveBrony> Glass....glass everywhere!
<GarrettBrony> Thrackerzod this was the point at which Micheal Bay decided me wanted to make movies
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Shiitt....
<JackofApples> Yay! :) Ouch.
<Ann> But it's still does a respectible job... most of the time, on reporting of the news.
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: Or hevan help us, MSNBC.
<Vordox> And Landed on Glass... AND GLIDING On glass, FUCK ow
<Vordox> Where's the feds? =P
<derpy_pony> does not speak for special effects, Calcos323
<CriticKitten> kandarihu: Fox News *is* partisan. Just because other organizations are also partisan doesn't make Fox "less partisan" by compare. The only organization I'd say is arguably worse is NBC.
<red_ony> I realize some media where I live has some bias..but nowhere as bad as everything US I've seen...oO
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: it'S not that bad, he was riding on the floormat
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, exactly. Although I hear MSNBC doesn't get a lot of ratings.
<Ryunosuke> they ded
<Calcos323> derpy_pony: What do you mean?
<Meanwhile> Vordox: There.
<Vordox> Aaah there it is, aye Meanwhile
<RaveBrony> ded
<Sumica> 00,10there went the choper
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ahh fuck the FBI
<Vordox> LAWL
<Ryunosuke> lols
<Vordox> Expendable FEDS
<derpy_pony> this is top ten worthy?
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: I know hard line Democrats who point and laugh at MSNBC. SERIOUSLY.
<Calcos323> derpy_pony: There aren't very many I've seen that top it.
<Ann> Fox News though really takes the right too far. to a point where they're trying to please a demographic > seriously reporting on news.
<BronyInstrumental> the only new i ever get is ITV and BBC and they're both alright
<fluffle_puff> MSNBC is bad, but not as much as Fox
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as it was actaly explosions and not CG yeah this was good
<JackofApples> MSNBC is certainylu just as biased, but...ah ain't sure whether ya call it 'worse', Fox tends ta distort facts alot but yeah...ah laught at it.
<Vordox> Oh crap
<RivaLz> And now tell me which "Johnson" did died?
<SirGanjalf> FINALLY
<Vordox> Sumica: <3 Nothings beat real.
<Ann> I'm not saying other news ins't biased garbage, just, not as much.
<Calcos323> See? Sumica knows what's up.
<JackofApples> :D
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, the reason I didn't mention NBC isn't because they're less partisan. I just wanted to point out that CNN is partisan too.
<SirGanjalf> I thought my chat was dead hard:|
<Vordox> WHO said ANYTHING about that sidekick being inadequate? XD
<Ann> Sorry, I don't ever watch or listen to MSNBC so I can't say about that.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Inbound Final Showdown....
<Ann> Why do I start these things?
<derpy_pony> please don't discuss it seriously, Calcos323
<SirGanjalf> Ho ho ho!
<Kandarihu> But the reason why FOX News gets all the shame is because it leans right while ALL THE OTHERS lean left.
<derpy_pony> not in the condition for that
<Sumica> 00,10supprise
<Calcos323> derpy_pony: Certainly
<Vordox> BLACK GUY HITTING BLACK GU
<RaveBrony> Booom!
<Vordox> RACISTS
<JESmith71> At least CNN did a decent report on the fanbase
<Ann> I disagree Kan.
<Calcos323> Surprise, motherfucker
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Argyls kicking ass
<JackofApples> Ah fergot it was christmas in the film!
<Ryunosuke> pawnch
<SirGanjalf> Surprise mothafucka!
<RaveBrony> Pawch!!
<Eulshy> Heres an idea shut up about the damn news already
<Lil_B> the only news I trust nowerday are N24, but all the most viiewed are the insulting onces, RTL, Sat1, even ZDF
<fluffle_puff> I've seen both news stations drop people because of their views
<Method_Fish> Lol
<Vordox> Dat pride smile
<CriticKitten> kandarihu: Actually it's more because Fox tends to outright lie whereas most other organizations spin and slant, but yeah.
<GarrettBrony> Kandarihu but given the fact that CNN gave us foder for Fan art and all fox news did was point and laugh at us then I think Cnn is moar credible
<Kencolt> He's been waiting all night to do that.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> HAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNSSSSS
<RaveBrony> Haaaannnsss!!!
<Sumica> 00,10haaaaaaaaaans
<SirGanjalf> Punching guy in the glasses?
<Ann> I'm not saying others aren't biased, I'm consertive, but Fox News takes it too far most the time.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> HAAAAANSSS
<red_ony> Lil_B: You should get a news paper
<PinkiePieYoshi64> SOOOOOOLO!

<SirGanjalf> KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAANS
<Lil_B> I like the very very subtle Hints of the Symphony Nr. 9 in the background
<RaveBrony> This chat never disappoints, lol :D
<Ann> Trust me, I'd love to see more right leaning news, but I can't take Fox news seriously. Though I watch Canadian news mostly so I can't speak on a lot of Yank channells.
<JackofApples> Kandarihu: The reason why Fox gets a ton of bashin' is because they tend ta distort facts and go way too far with it, it has nothing to do with sides. XD
<JackofApples> Anyway, final showdown.
<red_ony> Lil_B: 300 % more in-depth than anything on tv
<Lil_B> Fou_Lou me nether

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<Eulshy> behind his head
<Eulshy> lol
<Ann> I agree, this is too fast for actually discussion.
<JESmith71> I don't know. Someone started it and it blew up?

<Pudge> outside of movie night
<fluffle_puff> Then again they never talk about any third party candidates
<Sumica> 00,10then later on when he made the movie they then riped it off in japan
<derpy_pony> translate it into your language
<CriticKitten> Anyways, this is really a solid film. It's a pity so many young'ins don't remember this one.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I like the Ponies silhouettes against the credits
<Vordox> Sumica: Did you know Hollywood rip of everything? =P
<derpy_pony> seriously
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Star Horse... >.>
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony. What movie did I miss?
<JESmith71> Followed by Star Wars Re-enacted by Ponies probably
<SirGanjalf> Star Wars 2: Star Warser
<otherness> time for lunch!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> OtakuTom: Die Hard
<SirGanjalf> that was bad
<CriticKitten> Sumica: waitwut
<Fisheh_Fish> Wat movie now?
<Pudge> So, is Star Wars up next?
<GarrettBrony> Pudge your in for a treat up next is Star Wars a new hope the NOn special Edition!
<JackofApples> Star Wars with ponies?!
<derpy_pony> hi OtakuTom ....only die hard 1...you've seen it 500 times before
<Pudge> GarrettBrony: Awesome :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Ode to joy
<CriticKitten> Sumica: You mean Lucas ripped off an Eastern concept instead of the other way around?
<SirGanjalf> dat choir
<SirGanjalf> *sets speakers to the max*
<Sumica> 00,10amazing no?
<Pudge> Star Wars is BEST series period
<OtakuTom> Actually, derpy_pony, I haven't >_>
<CriticKitten> That's very amazing, yes. XD
<Lunchbox> I can't hear this without thinking of Evangelion.
<derpy_pony> he has no shoes...the rest is generic action hero stuff
<Ponies47> Hey Bronysith get your (squee) in here! STAR WARS!
<CriticKitten> I'm used to seeing Chinese ripoffs of everything.
<Sumica> 00,10Diewars: Starsharder
<Freefall29> there was a game on the famicom that's based on episode 4... darth vader is a boss on tatooine and he turns into a scorpion
<Bronysith> STAR WARS!!!!
<ScootaChicken> Am I the only one who doesn't like the original series that much?
<SlurryMoon> 3haha
<Bronysith> FUCK YES
<GarrettBrony> Pudge you are only Counting New Hope , Empire and Jedi Right?
<SlurryMoon> 3silly japan
<Bronysith> stfu Freefall29
<Lil_B> And every humans will be brothers
<JackofApples> Yayyyy~! That'll be fun! CriticKitten: Yes, he did. And now, we wait for the credits.
<SirGanjalf> Darth Hard
<Pudge> GarrettBrony: of course, but I still like the new ones too, just not as much
<Kandarihu> Sumica, for future reference, I'd just like to suggest that me telling anyone what to or not say, no matter how desperate I am about it, is a S3 spoiler.
<JackofApples> ScootaChicken: No, you're not alone. :3
<ScootaChicken> I just don't think they're that good films.
<Ponies47> Bronysith: Star Wars is boss
<Bronysith> STAR WARS TIME
*GarrettBrony hugs his brother, Lil_B
<shuddup> WAZZUP AWESOME BRONIES
<JESmith71> Inb4 Bronysith gets into a debate with someone about the prequels not exisiting at least one point during the course of the next three nights
<Bronysith> Ponies47: you dont say?
<derpy_pony> yay
<Ponies47> Bronysith: :P
<Lil_B> GarrettBrony thanks bro :)
<red_ony> Sumica: You mean The hidde3n fortress?
<GarrettBrony> Pudge you like episodes 2 and 3 only right?
<Bronysith> JESmith71: already happened earlier today
<Sumica> 00,10wah huh Kandarihu?
<ScootaChicken> The acting and story are all pretty boring, the only thing that really makes it special are the special effects
<derpy_pony> freude :)
<CriticKitten> The prequels DID exist.
<ScootaChicken> And in this day and age they're hardly mind blowing.
<CriticKitten> They still do.
<shuddup> die hard???
<Fisheh_Fish> Time for some multitasking
<Lil_B> I really highly suggest searching for an english translation of this song
<CriticKitten> And honestly....they're not as shit as people say.
<Bronysith> TIME FOR EPICNESS
<Kandarihu> I did it twice, and I'm very ashamed of it.
<Pudge> GarrettBrony: they're the better ones yeah, but i still dont see why ep 1 gets so much hate
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> LOL Intermission
<JackofApples> They just weren't all that great, Now then. Intermission!
<Vordox> Erm...
<Meanwhile> Und dann intermission.
<RaveBrony> Intermission!! <3
<Bronysith> yes
<Vordox> Oh yeah this isn't BMN. XD Thought it was Pony episode
<Freefall29> i'm still on the credits
<derpy_pony> what is the next movie?
<Bronysith> this is epic
<Ponies47> If you love Star Wars. BROHOOF! /)
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Star wars
<Meanwhile> You've got twenty minutes to go get drunk.
<Pudge> :( I miss the old Derpy intermission
<red_ony> It's so late here...no 30 min intermission please and on to the Star Wars!
<RaveBrony> Ponies47: (\
<Kandarihu> The first time, I threatened to speak rudely to someone over it.
*Bronysith slices Ponies47 s hand off
<SirGanjalf> Intermission - gonna play some Binding of Isaac
<derpy_pony> trying to stay away here..help me
<Kandarihu> Over stuff.

<Obsidian> Ponies47: (\
<derpy_pony> awake, not away
<JackofApples> Gonna get me some food! Ponies47: (/
<derpy_pony> wahtever
<Narolas> Pudge: Don't worry, derpy is still in this one
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Ponies47: /)
<Ponies47> Bronysith: :(
*Liokin-Bot can honestly say he has never seen a single star wars movie in his life :/
<Fou_Lou> SirGanjalf: its such an awesome game
<CriticKitten> The reason they're bad is mostly because they lack a lot of the care that went into the old ones. They focus on modern Hollywood action movie stuff and forget to make the story quality.
<Pudge> Hurrah
<RaveBrony> Needs more walking Derpy!!
<String_Shredder> Intermission... I'm gonna watch The Monkees!
<Freefall29> the buffering is impossible for me to love and tolerate... i'm skipping the movie. see you guys another time
<Ryunosuke> whos streaming the next movie? :p
<CriticKitten> But they aren't really "bad". Mediocre, really.
<Kencolt> I remember waiting to get into Episode 3, and listening to people start worrying about what was going to happen, and saying no spoilers. And I was, seriously, trying not to laugh... EVERYONE knew ALREADY what was going to happen in 3, WHAT SPOILERS?
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: SW 1-3?
<Lil_B> I have to drop out now, I will not make it through all 3 Star Wars Movies, its 3am here
<derpy_pony> 20 minutes...
<JESmith71> Is there a 10 minute version of the next intermission, or will you reuse the old Derpy one again if you just need a shorter intermission?
<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: Yeah.
<GarrettBrony> Pudge ok imagine this. your a star wars fan in the 90's its been 16 years since Jedi. and Jar Jar Binks comes on screen. it a sense of betrayal. (Spoony style) not it is not as bad as the hate makes it out to be
<SlurryMoon> 3did you know tht most "Japanimation" came from this one guy who I don't actually know the name.... But anyway, that one guy was using inspiration from Walt Disney, then most of Japan is began using that same guy's style. Now, a lot of American animaters are trying to copy the "anime" or "Japanimation" style. So in the end, America influenced Japan who is influencing America. And I bet
<SlurryMoon> 3even before then people were flip-flopping back and forth on who influenced who.
<Ryunosuke> Fou_Lou, there was no star wars 1-3
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Is this gong to be the original Star Wars or what? Because I have the original Theatrical versions on my computer....
<SlurryMoon> 3man that was random
<Liokin-Bot> Green
<Ponies47> Yes it was SlurryMoon yes it was :P
<Obsidian> Dat green spam
<JESmith71> Original one PinkieYoshi64
<Meanwhile> Dat block of green.
<red_ony> Lil_B: Nacht. :)
<Kandarihu> SlurryMoon, Osamu Tezuka?
<FillyFlam> SlurryMoon: I actually did know that.
<Pudge> CriticKitten: 1-3 werent terrible by any means no, but they just didnt live up to the original trilogy. on they're own they are solid movies
<ZappyTheUnicorn> That was random indeed.
<GarrettBrony> Ryunosuke At least there was no star wars Episode 1
<CriticKitten> Oh stop it. They're not horrible, they're not "betrayal" on the level of Ultima or other things.
<Lil_B> red_ony gute nacht :)
<shuddup> DARING DOO AND RAINBOW DASH!!!
<Fou_Lou> Ryunosuke: like this ignorance.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> TALLY HO!
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: That's the thing, inspire, not plagiarism
<shuddup> uhhh
<Vordox> That's how the world twists
<derpy_pony> the name would be interesting now, SlurryMoon. what you say here sounds massively influential
<Spectrum_Rush|> Und dann SlurryMoon added a pasture to the chat
<Kencolt> SlurryMoon: Actually, it didn't all come from him-- but yes, Osamu Tezuka did pioneer Japans modern Anime and Manga industries.
<Fisheh_Fish> 17 min of Criminal Minds, here I come
<CriticKitten> They're just mediocre. That's more of a crime than anything. They took a great universe and story, and made it mediocre.
<Ryunosuke> midichlorians and jar jar binks, that is all :)
<JESmith71> Daring Do, any relation to Derpy? I've been reading a fanfic about that
<Kandarihu> Well, I know that anime certainly isn't emulating the art style of Ukiyo-e.
<Lil_B> SlurryMoon how long do you think will Star Wars take (and will be all 3 movies shown in a row?)
<Pudge> GarrettBrony: I mean at least it's not as bad as Saw trying to keep its storyline alive
<shuddup> popcorn flavourd muffinz???
<derpy_pony> 17 minutes
<JESmith71> It's just Episode 4 tonight
<shuddup> dinky?
<Liokin-Bot> shuddup: Derpy's babeh
<Calcos323> I'm back...
<JESmith71> Empire tonight, Jedi on Wenesday
<Pudge> JESmith71: yeah just ep 4
<shuddup> lol
<Obsidian> WB Calcos323
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Wb Calcos323
<JESmith71> No I mean Empire tomorrow
<shuddup> BEEZ
<Ryunosuke> NOT THE BEES
<Pudge> A BEEEEEEEEE?
<Nerom> Why did she burn
<derpy_pony> if they are too bees, you are too weak
<Calcos323> After going 3 days without smoking, I gave in
<Kandarihu> Generally speaking, Japanese animation is art. American animation is entertainment.
<Waffles> wuts this <.<
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Random Question? What's your favorite Star Wars Film?
<GarrettBrony> Whos wants Mt. Dew?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> awww shame Calcos323
<Calcos323> I'm not happy with myslef right now
<Ponies47> BEES
<red_ony> I should see that film...what was it wickerman?
<shuddup> lol
<Pudge> GarrettBrony: I'll take one good sir
<Kandarihu> And there are certainly exceptions to both of that, but that seems to be the trend.
<GarrettBrony> PinkiePieYoshi64 Empire
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Calcos323: keep trying
<SlurryMoon> 3we're only showing the first one today, tomorrow will be ep 5 and then ep 6 on Wed
<Ponies47> What is Friendship pony don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
<shuddup> WHAT IS FRIENDSHIP
<CriticKitten> Ryunosuke: Honestly? Jar Jar is terrible, but the concept of midichlorians has existed for some time. >_>
<PinkiePieYoshi64> GarrettBrony: I agree completely :D
<SlurryMoon> 3rather the *4th* one today
*GarrettBrony gives everypony here a MT. DEW
<Kandarihu> And Episode 1 doesn't exist, right?
<Calcos323> PaladinDrakkenWolf: I will. Thanks for the encouragement
<Pudge> Calcos323: I've been there, used to smoke.
<Sumica> 00,10show the odd number eps this week
<derpy_pony> maybe I got it right.....star wars today?
*PaladinDrakkenwolf takes My. Dew and pours it down the drain, yuck
<Kandarihu> And 2 and 3 are sequels to a movie that doesn't exist, and by proxy also don't exist, right?
<Sumica> 00,10then evens next week
*String_Shredder hugs GarrettBrony "OH MY GOD THANK YOU"
<shuddup> lol
<Calcos323> Pudge: How in the hell did you manage to quit? Makes me want to eat babies.'
<JESmith71> Can we have some Disney park Star Tours in here after the movies?
<GarrettBrony> Kandarihu Episode 1 is just a Myth just to scare new Star wars fans
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> umm
<SlurryMoon> 3Did I successfully ninja?
<Pudge> Calcos323: because I only smoked like 1 or 2 a day
<JackofApples> Yes
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<SlurryMoon> 3if not, refresh your stream
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirz any word on how to make a background transparent ?
<JackofApples> And so is Jar Jar.
<Meanwhile> Yup. During the intermission.
<Calcos323> Pudge: That explains it
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: I wonder...How's te Youtube list going?
<Ryunosuke> I got dieded
<CriticKitten> Anyone screaming "betrayal" at the Force-infused bacteria obviously isn't as big of a Star Wars geek as they want to sound. Because those things were established in a book in the Extended Universe before Ep 1 came out, and "Jedi scanners" existed even before then. XD
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> SlurryMoon: all I see is black
<Kandarihu> I'm getting a black screen.
<SlurryMoon> 3okay, then, let's get a going
<derpy_pony> yay yourself
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> there we go
<red_ony> I second the yay
<Whiskra> jaej
<Pudge> Calcos323: only thing I'll smoke nowadays is Hooka
<JESmith71> Who's streaming? Did Sumica switch it over to Slurry?
<derpy_pony> dafuq...
<Meanwhile> We just going to skip half the intermission? Ok then. .-.
<Calcos323> Stur Wurs

<CriticKitten> JackofApples: That's something that's always bugged me. People rag on Ep 1 for things that were actually firmly established canon by that point. How did people think Jedi scanners worked? MAGIC?!? XD
*Pudge turns his bass up to 11
<derpy_pony> ponies don't know shit about star wars
<TrixieMuffin> but starwars isnt a trilogy (trollface)

<Bronysith> SlurryMoon:and the mst3k cause they in the screen
<Bronysith> shit
<Thrackerzod> pew pew pew
<JackofApples> Do it more! More ponies in Star Wars! 8D
<Bronysith> stfu JackofApples
<Barbetos> lazer beaams
<Bronysith> just like when i was a kid!
<CriticKitten> JackofApples: Return is probably not the strongest way to end the original trilogy, but all the same, yeah the Ewok bit is really kind of dumb.
<GarrettBrony> Pudge what if in the next rerelease of Star wars the digitally put in Ponies
<Pudge> I would jizz
<CriticKitten> The colors really POP in this version.
<AttacktheAndalite> Buffer, why?
<red_ony> ok...so who hasn't seen this??
<Bronysith> madness
*Lil_B takes red_ony's Popcorn and noms "thanks" :)
<derpy_pony> it's 03:15 here and what is this?
<Bronysith> THIS IS DEATH STAR!
<Kandarihu> Since I'm not allowed to tell people what not to explain, I expect to get in a huge political debate through at least half of the movie.
<SlurryMoon> 3and yes, this is the despecialized edition
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Just for this film, I'm putting on my headphones... and volume's at full blast :)
<Ponies47> BUFFER! :[
<TrixieMuffin> wow , lag is really horrible
<GarrettBrony> NO this is STAR WARS!
<shuddup> madness???
<Pudge> The remake of Star Wars ep 4 is directed by Lauren Faust
<Calcos323> FUN FACT: C-3PO has both the first line in the first movie ("Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor!) and the last line in the last film ("Oh, no, not again.").
<Ryunosuke> wars in stars :)
<AttacktheAndalite> No, this is Patrick
<GarrettBrony> shuddup NO THIS IS STAR WARS!
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: If you want to argue with people I'd recommend joining a debate club.
<Vordox> NONE CGI
<Kencolt> derpy_pony: You're kidding, you just have to be... What is this indeed.
<Bronysith> oh god i fucking love this. probably seen this same movie 100 times
<Pudge> GarrettBrony: Where's theMtn. Dew?
<JackofApples> Everpony The Eworks did not defeat the Empire, they just distracted them! :D
<String_Shredder> for all of the shiny reflective objects in the film, they do a good job of not showing the crew
<Kandarihu> I don't argue because I like to.
<derpy_pony> Kencolt: where is picard?
<GarrettBrony> and those Rebels are all just 2 days from retirement Pudge
<RaveBrony> pew pew pew pew pew!!

<JackofApples> Shooting, 501st and door breaching! Yay door breaches! Wow, the Rebels succcckkk at aiming.
<Bronysith> Sumica: kneel before lord vader
<Vordox> Sumica: How could you forget Star Ballz?
<Calcos323> Sumica: For the love of God, kick the ones that quote that.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> wait... this is Theatrical version or 90s?
<derpy_pony> pew pew is best pew
<Kencolt> STormtroopers are able to hit anyone except a character with an actual role.

<GarrettBrony> otakon nope I think Needles is fucking with you
<CriticKitten> Man, Darth Vader's really imposing in the opening shots. O.o
<Zanon> han damn shot first
<CriticKitten> Just that breathing.
*TK-421 pew pew pew
<Ryunosuke> Zanon, Han did not shoot first
<JESmith71> (Sings to the tune of the Imperial March) Here comes Darth Vader walkin' through the door, he kicked Luke Skywaler 'cross the floor
<shuddup> R2-D2
<Ryunosuke> he's the only one who shot :)
<Bronysith> Ryunosuke: i love you
<PinkiePieYoshi64> TK-421! Why aren't you at your post?!?! >:O
<Ponies47> Oh just because it's Star Wars
<Barbetos> I wonder if he uses the Android OS?
<Pudge> I wanna meet the VA for R2-D2
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5234/
<red_ony> back when r2d2 didn't have rocked thrusters
<JackofApples> Ryunosuke: Don't...mention that stupidity, I feel ashamed to be a fan when people seriously bring that up. XD
<red_ony> oO
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> WHERE ARE THE PLANS??!!
<otakon> goddammit
<GarrettBrony> was R2D2 cussing all the time in these movies
<CriticKitten> They surrendered? SISSIES
<otakon> it figures
<Spectrum_Rush|> James Earl Jones <3
<shuddup> OMG
<shuddup> YOUR KILLING HIM\
<Lunchbox> that's no way to get answers
<Bronysith> i came....to this chat
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat face protection....
<CriticKitten> ded
<TK-421> I remember the Brock's Dub of this...
<GarrettBrony> that was the ambassator
*Bronysith is sith
<Barbetos> Vader is bad at interiagation.
<Kandarihu> I'm gona pay attention to the whole Han Shooting First thing.
<Vordox> Dat gun
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> die
*Ponies47 Puts on sun glasses
<red_ony> Fail
<CriticKitten> Idiot.
<twilight_sprinkle> sigh, why do star wars have to be streamed so late for me
<derpy_pony> back in these days, we needed a cart for our usb network connector *swings his cane*
<Vordox> fail
<Calcos323> pew
<GarrettBrony> get phasers to fun
<pony_6632> Damn, I missed some... :(
<Barbetos> She set for kill
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 Lord Vader/Fluttershy/PInkie Pie quotes
<CriticKitten> SET PHASERS TO HUG
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> set for stun, yet she sets for kill
<otakon> yh I hate to say it but my stream is lagged to hell
<GarrettBrony> and a hot prisoner for that
<Vordox> LAWl
<Kandarihu> Hey, that's something we don't see often. A stormtrooper shoots and actually hits his target
<Vordox> HAHAHA Dit R2-D2 walk therE?XD
<Pudge> oh leia, you're so weak
<Squallken> i love this movie
<otakon> PaladinDrakkenwolf: she has 1 settting blaster.
<shuddup> why is r2-d2 walking like that???
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: Same here.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> otakon: oh okay
<otakon> yh so for once it's NOT just me
<Sumica> 00,10and the empire would have won if that guy was't so stingy with the lasers
<Barbetos> R2D2 x C3P0
<PinkiePieYoshi64> There's one! Hold your fire, there's no life form..
<JackofApples> Fun Fact: That was captain Raymus Antilles, no relation to Wedge.
<Bronysith> DEAR GEORGE LUCAS on your work for the prequels... http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1741/
<Kencolt> Stormtroopers hit targets all the time. Just not lead characters.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: to be fair, everyoen seems to have problems with imperial blasters
<otakon> Kencolt: Plot Armor
<red_ony> sooo...how much do lazer shots cost...Just shoot the damn thing!:O
<Bronysith> Sumica: yup... GLORY TO THE EMPIRE
<CriticKitten> Okay, random question. Why didn't they just take the ship into dock?
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Would have been a short movie.
<Zanon> r2-d2 does what the buck it wants
<otakon> CriticKitten: what dock?
<Fisheh_Fish> Off to get popsicles
<otakon> CriticKitten: they're in the MIDDLE OF SPACE
<CriticKitten> otakon: Star Destroyers have a MASSIVE ship dock. :p
<Liokin-Bot> So I couldnt help but notice the rebel helmet design. Its about a quarter of a centimeter thick and its strap looks like a piece of oxy cotton taped to some velcro. Defensive quality.....
<GarrettBrony> Wars IN SPACE
<Bronysith> otakon: have i ever said how much i love these movies?
<Calcos323> All I can think of right now is the Emerald City Comiccon radio play
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon: For some reason, I always seem to be a minute behind the stream when certain mods stream for some reason. It could be their computers are probably running faster and better than mines.
<Pudge> R2-D2 is like Buck you I do what I want.
<GarrettBrony> Take her away
<otakon> CriticKitten:yeah and your point? they took it into the ship when they boared it.
<red_ony> buffer...:(
<Spectrum_Rush|> Bronysith: you don't say
<Obsidian> Calcos323:
<Kandarihu> It seems the stun beam covered the entire width and height of the corridor. It's more of a wave than a beam. That's why the stormtrooper was able to shoot her. Missing is physically impossible.
<CriticKitten> otakon: Large enough to host a small fleet of TIEs among other things. These are supposed to be planet-surpressing forces.
<Obsidian> Calcos323: Me too
<FillyFlam> Rebel SPAH
<otakon> yh I know
<Barbetos> The senate? PFFFTT
<Pudge> AttacktheAndalite:
<Pudge> AttacktheAndalite: When Sumica streams it usually gets way behind
<Vordox> Star...Bucks?
<Calcos323> BUFFERING
<Bronysith> hey Sumica ...i just figured out whats going on right now...
<red_ony> why didn't you shoot it like I told you?! :O
<Nerom> night evey one
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> One does not simply stop Darth Vader
<otakon> night Nerom
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Nerom
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night Nerom
<Calcos323> Bye Nerom
<otakon> yh my stream is lagging out crazy
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: His computer is probably running better, that's what I'm guessing. Not really sure.
<Reactor> Hey, everyone!
<otakon> it was FINE for Die Hard
<Kandarihu> Logically said, it would make tactical sense for the stormtroopers to set their blasters to stun for ALL engagements. If they're ordered to kill, they still have their feet and fists for that.
<Sumica> 00,10nah that comes later Bronysith
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> frozen?
<Lil_B> hi Reactor
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> emo C3PO
<SlurryMoon> 3shh, if you're buffering, don't yell about it in chat
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Reactor
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Reactor
<GarrettBrony> did you see the Star wars short Troops. IT HAS TOM SERVO IN IT
<SlurryMoon> 3if it's something I can fix, I would know about it already
<Pudge> O
<Lil_B> he was almost frozen today
<Calcos323> Hey Reactor
<otakon> SlurryMoon: any chance you could turn off the ponies? That might help
<CriticKitten> otakon: Judging from that shot, no they didn't take it into dock. They just parked above it. :P
<JackofApples> :O
<Pudge> I'm not buffering though
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: Try Popout...worked for me
<SlurryMoon> 3guys, the buffering is fine on my end
<JackofApples> Sand...it's course and rough...
<SlurryMoon> 3therefore, it's on your end
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> kick*
<CriticKitten> >sand in all directions
<SlurryMoon> 3I can't do anything about that
<AttacktheAndalite> Pudge: Actually, it seems to do fine when he streams a game
<Lil_B> I have 0 buffering :/
<Bronysith> they actually shot on location for these films. they traveled the fucking world to film theese. THATS one of the main reasons i love these films
<CriticKitten> >"this way is much safer"
<JackofApples> So much sand.
<otakon> yeah that helps NOTHING
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Beep boop beep
<Pudge> AttacktheAndalite: heck no, the chat and stream are always off by like 10 seconds
<Fisheh_Fish> Comb the desert
<otakon> goddamit
<Kencolt> Tunisia for these desert scenes, IIRC.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I'd die on Tatooine the first day...
<Vordox> Lawl Fisheh_Fish XD
<red_ony> and one of the reasons the prequels suck...all greenscreen
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> Fisheh_Fish: We ain't found SHIT:P
<Ryunosuke> that libyan desert
<Obsidian> Anypony see the Uncut: Director's cut of this?
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> *:O
<Calcos323> dayum
<Bronysith> red_ony: actually tehy were all blue screen
<JackofApples> And all the Clone Troopers are CGI.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I'd hate to meet the thing that left behind that skeleton!
<CriticKitten> Oh look, more sand.
<red_ony> Bronysith: Or that :D
<CriticKitten> DRAGON
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> dat skeleton
<Vordox> The same reason I like LOTR: So little Green screens
<Spectrum_Rush|> Krayt Dragon
<twilight_sprinkle> looks like a dragon skeleton
<JackofApples> D: The Krayt Dragon bones! 8D Yay!
<Bronysith> CGI doesnt work all the time. it worked well in terminator 2
<SlurryMoon> 3but, fine, I'll turn off the desktop ponies if you insist
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> glowing eyes
<Ryunosuke> a krayt dragon skeleton to be exact
<PinkiePieYoshi64> It is a Dragon Skeleton :D
<GarrettBrony> Vordox LOTR so little Greens Screens SO much New Zealand
<Bronysith> SlurryMoon: THANK YOU
<Pudge> I love these guys
<Calcos323> Bronysith: True dat.
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: Why? Just use Popout and it works =P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> thanks Slurry
<Bronysith> Calcos323: it was part of his character
<CriticKitten> inb4 HOO TEE DEE.
<Obsidian> Yay'
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Dat yay.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Yaay....
<Sumica> 00,10Boooo

<SlurryMoon> 3thing is, you all could be lying
<GarrettBrony> Jaws
<JackofApples> SlurryMoon: Just make them comment, don't make them on the screen.
<derpy_pony> yay
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttershy is gonna gank r2
<Vordox> Slurry, there's a bug on my screen, wipe it off please.
<JackofApples> That'd be fun.
<Pudge> SlurryMoon: stream isnt lagging for me
<JackofApples> :3
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> dem Jawas
<Ryunosuke> BZZZZZT
<PinkiePieYoshi64> ZAP!!!!
<Calcos323> Bronysith: Exactly, and besides, James Cameron makes the best sequels
<Ryunosuke> thunk
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> thunk*
<red_ony> ded
<SlurryMoon> 3and it's very annoying to have to turn off those things when it's having any problem for my test stream right next to me
<shuddup> NOOOOOO

<GarrettBrony> Who teenie
<Kandarihu> Calcos323, what if the original stinks?
<Zanon> hey those special effects were bucking awesome in their time.
<otakon> goddammit
<twilight_sprinkle> sigh, well its sleep time for me. bai gaiz
<Bronysith> GarrettBrony: IKR just because you can do it doesnt mean it is a good idea. I can take a syringe to extract all of the creme out of a cadbury egg and replace it with gravy, doesnt make it a good idea....or does it? hang on ill brb
<otakon> the embed isn't working right either
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night twilight_sprinkle
<BurningDesire> Hello~

<Obsidian> BurningDesire: Mod
<Bronysith> YES
<Kencolt> Oh, how I remember seeing for the first time-- during it's first theatrical run. I had just started College then, and well... was amazed.
<Ryunosuke> (Eve online players will know the reference)

<Ponies47> I'm wondering if I should just put my copy of episode 4 in and open the chat and just watch it like that. :/
<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: I basically mean that there's a reasonable "limit" to how long you can hold the "spoilers" claimer over people, and a movie from the late 70s is way past that mark. :P
<Bronysith> Sumica: they are over man...(hugs(
<ponibas> "play the same song"

*Bronysith force punches otakon through the internet
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: the big gun one of them was holding was a slightly remodeled mg3
<JESmith71> Otakon I was quoting that video with Billy West, Tara, and all those other guys doing some of the lines from this
<mylilpwny> satan drinks here
<Wrek> 05why does everythign in this movie look so much more... reall?
<ponibas> Kandarihu, 75% offa waht.. it's free?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Racists!
<Spectrum_Rush|> Wrek: cause it is
<Meanwhile> Wrek: Because it's not CGI?
<CriticKitten> Wrek: Because it is.
<Bronysith> Wrek: cause everything is organic man
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> werewolf, satan & buttheads
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek: Puppets.
<otakon> Wrek: bc physical effects and NO CG
<Vordox> Wrek: I dunno... Maybe it's the clothes.
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst oh Oo
<Eulshy> otakon, all well for texas, im way far north
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And people in costumes.
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: I agree. But does that count for the nonexisting prequels too. because i said basically something shown in those
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not computers.
<JESmith71> Because CGI didn't exist in he 70s
<Bronysith> Wrek: this is before george lucas got his hard on with cgi
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> Greedo!
<Zanon> there was no cgi back then
<red_ony> no droids alowed :/
<GarrettBrony> Calcos323 you could pick up a lot of Women like that
<otakon> CHEWIE!
<Obsidian> Less CGI
<JackofApples> Technophobes~!
<ponibas> evil monkey!
<Sumica> 00,10cause it's not filtered 50 ways and covered in cg remakes
<Thrackerzod> Wrek because gorge is a god
<otakon> the BEST Bacca
<otakon> also, friendly Lizardman
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: basically what sumica said
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Fun Fact: there are less models in the whole original trilogy than in Phantom Menace.

<Barbetos> When I see this scene all I can think of is all the bounties that would have showed up on the boards in Star Wars Galaxies XD
<Kandarihu> I find the lack of macroblocking in this impressive. And I've seen quite a lot of macroblocking on this stream before.
<Vordox> Ponies47: Noone cares about american hereditary :P

<otakon> Eulshy: I've tried, it's the servers atm
<PinkiePieYoshi64> notohing to see here folks! Keep playing the music....
<CriticKitten> Fun fact: the blood actually shouldn't be there. Lightsabers supposedly cauterize any wounds they inflict, so there shouldn't be blood. Still, I love that scene. :P
