<cachi01> goku sounds like a girl in japanese
*DairyCannon tosses Mad Milk onto the chat
<Shizuka> 13hack and slash, voiced by rattrap and optimus primal
<otakon> cachi01: he does, supposed to convey his innocence IIRC
<Angel_Espeon> 13Raindrops keep falling on my head~
<LadyCanary> Also, Shizuka, the new newsletter made me think of you :3 :3
<MrSnugglewoods> GOKU VS SUPERMAN thread:P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Pinkie Pie sounds like a man in Russian
<otakon> MrSnugglewoods: NO
<Flutters> LOL
<cachi01> lol
<Shizuka> 13ikr~

<cachi01> yeah
<Dken2021> ooooooh
*Viri stops throwing water to AE
<Viri> 14sorry
<Shizuka> 13we thought a bit too late to do roseluck for my meet the mods whenever we get to it, but kirz doesn't do the thursday letters <3

<DairyCannon> lol
<L[a]korv> the hell
<Bronysith> AHHAHAHA
<alexxm> yeah but it sounds odd when the father of 2 sounds like a little kid RainbowAsh
<CountDoofus> In the Japanese version, one of the Ginyu Force gets decapitated by Vegeta. In the US version, he just died. Meh.
<MrSnugglewoods> OHH movie cliche
<OmegaMetroidBrony> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1927/ :3
<DairyCannon> lol Bob
<Kandarihu> Goku was voiced by a woman. He was a young child from the beginning and when the storyline called for him to grow up into an adult, fans were horrified to the thought that Goku would be recast, so his original Seiyuu stayed on the role all the way.
<cachi01> #1? is this no more heroes?
<pablez94> alexxm: have u seen TheRainbowDash today? i'd like to show something to..(her ,right?)
<RainbowAsh> alexxm, he doesn't act like a typical father, either

<ZetaMetroidBrony> CCCP It's OmegaMetroidBrony it's just that my internet derped and kept my other nick in chat
<Midnight_Tempest> Fuzors and Transmetals
<Dark_Horst> any special reason?

<Lawlz> Right?
<Midnight_Tempest> oh not, Tigertron and Airazor!
<ACS13123> ...wait is this in the same world as transformers <.<

<cachi01> crush, kill, destroy, SWAG
<Shizuka> 13there's no longer energon interference

<Bronysith> sort of
<pablez94> hahahahahahahah http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4403/
*Randomnerd noms on his fresh bread with peanut butter and apple butter.
<Lawlz> But what is dis?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> special snowflake syndrome: A malady affecting a significant portion of the world's population wherein the afflicted will demand special treatment, conduct themselves with a ludicrous, unfounded sense of entitlement, and generally make the lives of everyone around them that much more miserable.The danger of this disease is that the sufferers rarely, if ever, know that they have contracted...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ...it, and continue about their merry way under the assumption that EVERYONE ELSE is the problem.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> 	This condition, if left untreated, can radically alter the carrier's demeanor, to include any of the following: a complete devolution to child-like behavior, temper tantrums, and/or fits of narcissistic rage.
<otakon> Shizuka: nice so no more overloading as much right?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> crap
<Lawlz> Ok, that's creepy.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> wrong window
<Shizuka> 13yep not as much
<Midnight_Tempest> they can also stay in robot form longer
<RX-78-SweetieBot> sorry guys
<WallDives> Lawlz: beast wars.
<Shizuka> 13plus the transmetals are immune now
<Lawlz> Beast Wars...
<Shizuka> 13so in general everyone stays in bot mode longer
<Lawlz> I want Go-bots, damn it!
<otakon> suddenly motorcycle
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 14Altaria.
<Lawlz> Why do robots OR spiders have breasts?
<Shizuka> 13fun fact, a couple eps from now rhinox will come out of beast mode, it's the last time he's ever seen on screen in it
<cachi01> ok i still have headaches thx to zelda and now i have 2 other series to worry about
<CK|Werk> Dat queen
<Soital> 12with aether eh
*Xanbreon lets Michel his~
<otakon> lol
<ACS13123> casualy watching kids react
<otakon> Megatron is best Queen
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Lawlz: because fanservice
<Michel> :P
<WallDives> cachi01: why a zelda headache? looking at the timeline again?
<cachi01> YES
<Very_Silly_Filly> How can a robot get choked
<Michel> did you preorder gw2 yet?
<otakon> freaky flower
<Michel> and talk to eccocode about the server? :P
<Xanbreon> I brought it for myself
<Xanbreon> played in the beta
<cachi01> WallDives: its just so hard to understand!
<Michel> kk
<otakon> Very_Silly_Filly: yet they can survive with their heads blown clean off
<Xanbreon> So sososos good
<Xanbreon> >__<
<Michel> WHAT IS THAT MISTFIRE WOLF!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh god the giant plant one
<DairyCannon> Shizuka loving that wiki page. All those jabs at the censors. :D
<Kandarihu> Very_Silly_Filly: must be some vital power conduits in his neck.
<Xanbreon> Have you sir?
<Michel> not yet :P
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<WallDives> cachi01: but there is already a canon timeline. So...
<Midnight_Tempest> its a cartoon, dont try to find logic in it
<Xanbreon> I didnt get the digital edition
*EccoCode hears his name pinged
<Michel> cant decide if i should get it or not :(
<Xanbreon> I mean
<Xanbreon> The extra edition
<cachi01> WallDives: THE CANON TIMELINE IS WHAT GIVES ME HEADACHES
<WindWhistler> ALOHA EVERYONE
<Xanbreon> I dunno, probs a lame elite
<cachi01> hi wind!
<Sexy_S2_Luna_of_War> Slag = poo?
<WallDives> cachi01: which one? there's 3.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Slag = whore
<Xanbreon> It probs summons a pet to use
<cachi01> WallDives: exactly
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: it's a low end Socratic exercise it needs SOME kind of consistancy
<Shizuka> 13slag is a generic curse~
<Kandarihu> The only thing giving me headaches right now... is my dirty glasses.
<WindWhistler> Canon timeline? Are we talking about Detective Conan?
<cachi01> WallDives: we thought there was nly 2 timelines
<hunterman210> oh god i cant think straight i dont know which way is up or down
<cachi01> but THERE ARE 3
<otakon> yeah I don't trust thsoe plants
<WallDives> cachi01: just because its there, doesnt mean it has to make sense. And no, WindWhistler.
<hunterman210> oh god
<WindWhistler> Because apparently only a year or so has passed in the two decades it's been around
<CK|Werk> The Zelda timeline is an idiotic construct by lazy devs who want to pretend they designed their games to tie together when they clearly never did.
<Very_Silly_Filly> inb4 ded
<cachi01> the failure, the kid, and the adult
<RyunosukeKnT> metal eating plants?
<WindWhistler> I mean the series
<RyunosukeKnT> what?
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: it does but when you try to apply human logic to robot logic, it just doesnt cross properly
<CK|Werk> Taking it as any sort of "canon" is nonsense.
<otakon> oh that shipping
<hunterman210> i just put my headphones and passed out
<Meanwhile> Mfw it loads up the stream and it says "Slag"
<Very_Silly_Filly> 'dat ponyshrug
<CK|Werk> Best ship
<otakon> CRAP!
<WindWhistler> OMG THEY'RE A COUPLE
<Shizuka> 13welp, been nice knowing you two, NOW GET ON THE BUS
<otakon> TENTACLE ROBOT RAPE!
<RyunosukeKnT> well
<cachi01> CK|Werk: or its just miyamoto being miyamoto
<hunterman210> thats how dizzy i am
<Midnight_Tempest> and this is the last we will see of them
<RyunosukeKnT> I see where this is going
<ACS13123> CRUSH, KILL, DESTROY, SLAG
<Scavender> rape time
<Sexy_S2_Luna_of_War> to quote vivi... "Hot robot sex"
<Dark_Horst> RAAAIIIP
<cachi01> lool slag
<Very_Silly_Filly> I think you guys have seen enough hentai
<Michel> someone on youtube says its a mount
<Bronysith> sry but otakon x tentacle monster
<Michel> :/
<WallDives> Miyahon has nothing to do with the timeline...
<Kandarihu> Robots are machines. Technically, they should have a lot more logic than humans. But they are sapient, so they have emotions too.
<hunterman210> what is this
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sexy_S2_Luna_of_War: No, it's hot spider secks
<Michel> wouldnt work with the elite skill then, tho
<otakon> welp they're dead

<Meanwhile> Spaaaaace.
<Xanbreon> (Im a bit out of date on the comic)
<WindWhistler> Though so far...the 3DS games haven't been all that great...
<cachi01> WindWhistler: kid icarus and mariiokart are eic
<cachi01> epic
<WallDives> and all I'm getting for the 3DS is virtues last reward.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, it's an amazing console, but it's game selection is one of the worst I've seen
<RX-78-SweetieBot> "Censoring the characters from utilizing any guns, yet it was perfectly acceptable for Frisket to wield a bazooka, as he was a dog. "
<WindWhistler> Harvest Moon keeps crashing on me...Skylanders is only 3 hours and 30 minutes long...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Lol
<WindWhistler> to beat the game I mean
<cachi01> WindWhistler: but skylanders is skylanders
<otakon> kirzstryfe: well that's a great help......goddammit
<CK|Werk> Whaaaat
<CK|Werk> :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> It made the NeoGeo game selection look good
<WindWhistler> And I heard Rayman 3D was a bust too
<cachi01> its a rayman 2 remake
<WindWhistler> cachi01: Wait, are you insulting Skylanders?!
<cachi01> another one....
<XAX> RX-78-SweetieBot: Lol.
<Dken2021> they appear to have CSI technology
<cachi01> WindWhistler: nope im saying its short
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's not something related to our stuff otakon, not much I can do :(
<Midnight_Tempest> big gun
<WindWhistler> Yeah, but the 3D features weren't that great
<CriticKitten> LOL
<cachi01> WindWhistler: i love spyro
<Dark_Horst> lol
<WindWhistler> The depth perception was bad
<RyunosukeKnT> uhh right

<hunterman210> oh god i cant think straight and im not drunk or high

<Dken2021> skylanders is three hours?
<WallDives> WindWhistler: Real time conflict: shogun empires?

*Digitalis continues to slide across the floor
<WallDives> I wasnt.
<Biglaw> Ah, HAPPY WORKER'S CELEBRATION! :D
<WindWhistler> No one ever admits they're butthurt if they're serious
*Dken2021 thinks someone's gonna say "only ten minutes to ponies" soon
<pablez94> kirzstryfe: u sure i cannot post vid links? this is not a REAL streaming....
*Midnight_Tempest does a power slide all around the chat.
<RyunosukeKnT> when does the newsletter go out usually?
<Meanwhile> Only ten minutes until NOTHING AT ALL.
*WindWhistler places sandpaper in the middle of the chat
<WallDives> So, you can grind Audinos to L100?
<Dken2021> around monday and tuesday
<alexxm> today RynunusukeKnT
<pablez94> kirzstryfe: it looks more like a countdown
<RyunosukeKnT> andd how long does it take for one to get on the mailing list :)
<Digitalis> Not real streaming, how silly.
<Midnight_Tempest> its like im wearing nothing at all... nothing at all... NOTHING AT ALL!
<Meanwhile> In ten minutes the stream will self destruct. We're running out of time!
<WindWhistler> Midnight_Tempest: You're going to feel pain soon
<Digitalis> Oh god Midnight_Tempest O_O
<Midnight_Tempest> XD
<Dken2021> not that long RyunosukeKnT
*WindWhistler points to sandpaper in his way
<RyunosukeKnT> hmm
<WindWhistler> his being Midnight_Tempest
<Digitalis> Smooth jazz will play before the stream explodes
<Digitalis> cool :D
<Dken2021> just message someone like kirzstryfe to get on the mailing list
<WallDives> well, I'll be back later.
<RyunosukeKnT> if I sent it out saturday or sunday should I be on it by today?
<TheRainbowDash> Alright, back everypony.:P
<WindWhistler> Maybe I should've laid a rug down...
*Midnight_Tempest slides across the sandpaper and bursts into flames.
<WallDives> later.
<WindWhistler> rug burns hurt more than sandpaper, right?
*PinkiePry sips his coke
<Biglaw> Hi TheRainbowDash! glomps
<TheRainbowDash> (has been glomped on)
<Dken2021> welcome back TheRainbowDash
<lolol> WindWhistler: yep
<Bronysith> THE ZOMBIES HAVE ARRIVED confront now or later
<MahBoi777> hi TheRainbowDash
<Meanwhile> Having been rug burnt but not sandpapered I couldn't give you an accurate answer WindWhistler.
<pablez94> ok bronies tell me: is kirzstryfe ignoring me? or he's simply AFK?
<cachi01> i always give 100% at work.............. 20% monday 15%tuesday 25%wednesday 30thursdays and 10% fridays
<Meanwhile> kirzstryfe: You alive?
<TheRainbowDash> pablez94: May just be AFK.
<alexxm> hey TheRainbowDash what have you been up to
*WindWhistler places porcupines in Midnight_Tempest's way
<Digitalis> he's probably busy
<Midnight_Tempest> honestly, rug burns only burn for a short time... sandpaper wounds effing HURT... losing several layers of skin is brutal
<Digitalis> or he doesn't want to be bothered
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Nothing much, and you?
<WindWhistler> You can't slide over purcupines...
<pablez94> TheRainbowDash: wait a sec.... U BACK!!!!

<Meanwhile> Bronysith: I will.

<Bronysith> hey everypony here http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2920/

<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1860/
<WindWhistler> Shizuka, you should add some Rayman or Touhou music.
<WindWhistler> or maybe Kirby...
<cachi01> ^
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler no one likes Rayman as much as you do.
<WindWhistler> Grape Gardens is good music
<RX-78-SweetieBot> or PSO

<cachi01> When they hear triumph's shout,Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray,And the Scrolls have foretold,Of black wings in the cold,That when brothers wage war come unfurled,Alduin bane of kings,Ancient shadow unbound,With a hunger to swallow the world.
<Lawlz> Those beeps are really screwing up my background gaming.
<cachi01> Stinky_Pinkie: yeah lol

<Meanwhile> cachi01: Nuz aan suul, fent alok, fod vin vuul, dovah nok, fen kos nahlot mahfaeraak, ahrk ruuz. Paaz keizaal fen kos stin nol bein Alduin jot.
<Lawlz> No, YOU are the demons. Quote from something.
<kenne> well im thinking about going to play toribash :P
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I tried drawing green hill today
<Meanwhile> Trying to remember the Draconish version of the Skyrim theme causes headaches.
<Lawlz> I'm thinking about going to play Dungeons of Dredmor.
<Lawlz> Who wants to help me think of a good name for my doomed hero, any ideas?
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello and thanks
<Meanwhile> Hero Mcdoomederson.
<Lawlz> Too long.

<Lawlz> Yep.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> you dont like alot of things meanwhile
<TheRainbowDash> Rainbow: Oh, hello, sorry won't be chatting frequently here, playing games and studying for my finals.:P
<Lawlz> Cannon Fodder is the winner.
<Meanwhile> True.
<Rainbow> For some reason, Ctrl+Alt+E is NOTHING.
<Meanwhile> I don't like liquorice.
<Darkts3> OO MARATHON
<Lawlz> So, I'm assuming heavy armor, with shields?
<Darkts3> 777
<LunaTheBorderlands> Neither do I
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Lawlz: what about "already dead"
<RX-78-SweetieBot> That I can agree on
<Rainbow>
<Meanwhile> I think liquorice is something you can only appreciate without tastebuds
<Rainbow> I don't know
<robotdragon7> i saw someone playing this on my first movie night
<Rainbow> Is this DOOM?
<Randomnerd> This looks really cool, I'm reading about it right now.

<Lawlz> Some advice for you good people, never ever eat tuna plain while drinking lemonade.
<alexxm> mine was revenge of the nerds
<Rainbow> See ya, everypony. Gotta go play TF2. Bye!

<Dark92Enigma> !
<RainbowcrashNBurn> My first was Hot fuzz
<Lawlz> Mine was three days ago.
<Lawlz> Thats the date, not the movie.
<robotdragon7> i think this was made by the same people who made halo, bungie.
<Randomnerd> robotdragon7: ^

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> They just fucking assume I want it
<Shane377> oh ok

<otakon> robotdragon7: just set it up dammit!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> You know the weirdest glitch that happened ot me?
<michael> mmmmmm
<Sumica> 00,10I would say shadowbroker is worth the price and perhaps overlord
<Bobeh> I wish I had a good enough PC to run Skyrim. :/
<otakon> robotdragon7: ALL PS3's have wireless adapters built in
<cachi01> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: every rpg needs a bug
<Digitalis> lol
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I went outside of a house in Skyrim and I spawned in the ground

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> You know what you can do with dragon skellitons?

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Use a raise dead spell on the corpse
<TheHoodyNinja> Ohai Wrek

<GLaDOS> Was Sumica the one streaming Burn Notice earlier today?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I hate it when I put items in my house and when I come back its all over the god damn floor
<Sumica> 00,10Yeah GLaDOS
<Digitalis> lmao!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Sumica: after getting it, i used the MG from collector ship exclusivly
<GLaDOS> Where did you get the episodes from?
<robotdragon7> im NEVER here when there is a dead space stream...that or there never IS ONE!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Any idea when the dlc for this comes out as GOTY
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm, would a subbed movie be good for B? i know a good old B movie, but its in french
<Lawlz> Thus ended the quest of Cannon Fodder the vegan emo pyro, who died after forgetting he was vegan and being murdered by debuffs after eating some cheese.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I don't think anyone has streamed dead space here before
<cachi01> robotdragon7: there never is a DS stream
<TheHoodyNinja> They need to
<Lawlz> AND EET VAS GOOD!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I can see why

<RainbowcrashNBurn> Lawlz: that must have been an awkward death

<TheRainbowDash> Bye pablez94! (kisses you)
<thisguy> ooh, fallout + doom = awesome ^_^
<LunaTheBorderlands> Thanks
<RX-78-SweetieBot> You learn this when you play videogames with him
<Lawlz> Nope.
<Chrysalis> i think i accept this
<Monfang|lazy> They aren't?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Fucking hate deathclaws
<cachi01> thisguy: u mean RAGE?
<robotdragon7> *sigh* gotta go mow the lawn. bye guys
<Sir_lockpicker> hi
<Chrysalis> LunaTheBorderlands what system do you play on?
<Meanwhile> Got distracted by crack...ed.com. What happened?
<LunaTheBorderlands> Xbox
<Lawlz> Rage? Rage?! Get out. Right now.
<Chrysalis> sweet, we should play sometime
<RainbowAsh> Monfang|lazy, I think 3000 is the limit for stories with multiple chapters. But they also got a limit for complete stories that is slightly lower.
<cachi01> lulz
<LunaTheBorderlands> We should
<thisguy> i miss the dart gun from fallout 3 :(
<twilight_sprinkle> so would a subbed B movie be enjoyable?
<cachi01> rage was goddamn big
<LunaTheBorderlands> But right now I have to go
<Monfang|lazy> Wait.... What?
<Chrysalis> also, RX-78-SweetieBot why is it such a deal that i am british?
<Chrysalis> fair enough
<RainbowAsh> twilight_sprinkle, we had one of those last week
<cachi01> 13 gb on xbox and 8 on ps3
<Lawlz> I used the hunting rifle more than any other weapon in the entire game.
<Chrysalis> hope you have a great day/night
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I would have to re-download all the DLC for borderlands...
<Monfang|lazy> I only have one chapter that is 2573 characters
<LunaTheBorderlands> Helping my parents buy a bew TV
<Lawlz> And it was awesome.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Chrysalis: is isnt
<Meanwhile> Seeya LTB.
<twilight_sprinkle> RainbowAsh: well last week nobody really followed the movie
<RX-78-SweetieBot> it*
<LunaTheBorderlands> I'll be back on tonight
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I tried to draw Green Hill this morning
<RainbowAsh> Monfang|lazy, is the story complete?
<Monfang|lazy> I don't think I can get it up to 3000 without just rambling on and on.
<Monfang|lazy> NO
<LunaTheBorderlands> See you guys later
*Meanwhile hugs LunaTheBorderlands.
*pablez94 kisses TheRainbowDash back and blocks the rising of her wing
<Monfang|lazy> I got 6, 7 chapters total to write.
<cachi01> ded
*LunaTheBorderlands hugs Meanwhile
*Chrysalis hugs LunaTheBorderlands
<RX-78-SweetieBot> It was just the first thing that popped into my mind
*LunaTheBorderlands hugs everypony
*RX-78-SweetieBot hugs LunaTheBorderlands
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Really? A shovel?
<TheRainbowDash> pablez94: Man, I want my wings to raised now!:D
<Lawlz> So, yesterday I read a story about Appledash using sex with a dead tree as a major plot point.
<Chrysalis> not sure if its better than "bitish guy with kinnect" or not
<Lawlz> And it was really weird.
<RainbowAsh> twilight_sprinkle, touche. But that might have been because of the movie itself. After all we have watched quite a bit of anime subs here outside of the movie night.
<Monfang|lazy> Lawlz, shouldn't that be for #Brony?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> depends on if you consider kinect an insult or not
<Lawlz> I have no idea.
<Meanwhile> I'm also British, so I think we outnumber RX-78-SweetieBot.
<twilight_sprinkle> RainbowAsh: yeah thats what i mean, the movie wasnt BMN material, which is why im curious if a subbed movie would be fun
<TheRainbowDash> Lawlz: Oh yeah, heard about it, but never read it, good thing that I haven't yet....:S
<Digitalis> =_(\
<Hazard> KICK ASS!!
<RainbowAsh> Monfang|lazy, that's hard then. You could always send it in and ask them if they could make an exception.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> You know what we need to stream?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Twilight
<TheHoodyNinja> I AM MADE OF CHEESE!
<Lawlz> Don't read it. ;_;
<Cypresswolf> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Duck Tales?
*cachi01 eats TheHoodyNinja
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Sumica: sooo tempting, ME3 is on sale on origin, but a friend will kill me for supporting EA following the DLC fuss on release
<TheHoodyNinja> GAH!
<TheRainbowDash> TheHoodyNinja: I am made of toast and Dashy powers
<twilight_sprinkle> ducj tales, wohoo!
<RainbowAsh> twilight_sprinkle, I definitely think so.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> We should stream the Twilight Saga
<cachi01> YEAH NINJACHEESE

<Chrysalis> RX-78-SweetieBot no
<MahBoi777> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: you should find The Thorn, it's awesome
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Deathclaws arnt much of a threat when you break their legs

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Deathclaws are piss easy when they have their legs broken
<otakon> Wrek: you are dead meat
<Lawlz> Man, all the people on the NSFW chat suck.
<TheRainbowDash> otakon: I faced Cazadors before, fucking difficult to beat, Deathclaws are just menacing themselves, but can be weak if their legs are weakened too.
<alexxm> what do you mean RX-78-SweetieBot
<Dark_Horst> which addon is this?
<otakon> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: yeah, except when they outnumber you 5 to one

<otakon> Meanwhile: from Fallout 1?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Blind my ass
<TheRainbowDash> What about multiple Cazadors otakon?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Did you not find that one in NV?

<SirGanjalf> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: What could be more practical than a gun in atomic wasteland?

<Invi|zombiefied> Omega-Arceus-Ridley if you do it right, you can
<TheHoodyNinja> dont need guns for that, just tell it to open
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Or the security system activates and murders you

<TheHoodyNinja> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: I pissed them off but they aint do shit, they know better

<Ryanier128> thanks Shamroc I don't play Fallout and I just got here, so . . . Hi everypony!
<MahBoi777> awesome weapon lol
<TheHoodyNinja> hi Ryanier128
<Dken2021> hai Ryanier128
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi Ryanier128
<MahBoi777> hi Ryanier128
<Aurora> it took me three months to 1cc EoSD, and I just recently found out I somehow had the max-life set
<Ray> 02Well, isn't that like something that would rather motivate you? .-.
<Aurora> so it wasn't even a legit 1cc
<Aurora> not really
<Aurora> I like figuring things out
<Phrostphyre> Hey
<Aurora> but not when I need to clear through ALL of the stages beforehand
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Red flare looks op, but the damage seemed a bit underwhelming, might be due to difficulty setting though (guessing its very hard?)
<Ray> 02True dat
<Shamroc> Krakass!
<Aurora> so like i said
<Aurora> I don't have the time to do that
<Ray> 02Also. 1cc EoDS
<Aurora> I just play to enjoy
<TheHoodyNinja> Anybody here ever played Legendary?
<MahBoi777> it is a hard DLC
<Aurora> the only time I try seriously is when I play extra modes
<Ray> 02Or 'semi-legal' 1cc.
<Ray> 02HOW.
<Shamroc> derp

<Phrostphyre> Is Minecraft a good game?
<Lunwere> yes
<Ryanier128> YES
<Invi|zombiefied> it is ok
<Biglaw> Because you can find laser guns in puddles of goo
<scootminer> no?
<Phrostphyre> That is.......amazing.
<TheHoodyNinja> ninjaxmas: Ok, now you must learn how to use everything as a weapon, grab anybody here but me and beat up Biglaw with them
<scootminer> thats a mod
<Biglaw> Whaat? Why?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Biglaw: hey, you can find perfectly good, uncooked meat in piles of ash :P
<Biglaw> I'm sorry, I don't play fallout
<Shamroc> RainbowcrashNBurn: and dont forget mini-guns inside brains

*Invi|zombiefied slaps ninjaxmas for killing people
<Rarity-Indeed> oh cool
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Shamroc: i havent played far through enough to see something like that :P
<Dark_Horst> Biglaw: those puddles of goo are all thats left of someone that got deintegrated by a plasma grenade
<Biglaw> ninjaxmas I do not think that is appropriate for the chat
<ninjaxmas> yea
<pyrocatboy> http://i.imgur.com/u7Fc6.jpg
<Ray> 02Like, really.
<Aurora> ok see
<RainbowcrashNBurn> furthest i got in new vegas is the town near the space station where the ghouls take the rocket
*TheHoodyNinja Throws Invi|zombiefied into the manticore pit for slapping his pupil

<Shamroc> oh bah Phrostphyre
<Aurora> I got into that game immediately, played it first because of chronological order (didn't realize it was the hardest), and didn't play any of the other games
<Aurora> not to mention, I played that game rather often
*TheHoodyNinja eats Invi|zombiefied's hand
<Vinyer> sit

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Cause I dont feel like making up a silly reason right now XD
<SirGanjalf> It looks kinda like Deckard's gun.(Blade Runner)
<Invi|zombiefied> Dark_Horst nice
<Dark_Horst> Invi|zombiefied: there'sa version of it called experimental mirv. it fires 6 at once
<SirGanjalf> ormaybe it's just me

<EpicPwnTime> whatever it is, it looks AWESOME!!!
*ninjaxmas Swordfights TheHoodyNinja while reciting the alphabet and narrowly beating him at a game of Yu-Gi-Oh
<SirGanjalf> How is Sniper Rifle more appropriate for closed areas?
<Ryanier128> Fallout: New Vegas
<EpicPwnTime> fallout is epic!!!!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Apperently my dad thinks other computers besides the Macbook Air are garbage
<TheHoodyNinja> ninjaxmas: Very good, your skills are improving, next time i will have to use my Egyptian god card
<Dark_Horst> maybe you should consider VATS from time to time
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I said do you want a computer that will last or a piece of garbage that puts up
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> *he
<twilight_sprinkle> my leeeeeg
<Invi|zombiefied> they seem very tough guys
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Freaking apple inthusiast
<Dark_Horst> wow... it worked
<Invi|zombiefied> yaaay
<RX-78-SweetieBot> VATS is for people who cant shoot.
<SirGanjalf> *cue Wilhelm's Scream*
<cachi01> ^
<Vinyer> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Vinyer, you are a 6Ariados.

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Is it true macs cant play games?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> you would think the house would collapse after that many explosions
<cachi01> have u heard of pokemon creepy black?
<Dark_Horst> RX-78-SweetieBot: VATS is for people who want tosee awesome cose up splatter in slow mo
<TheHoodyNinja> ninjaxmas: Hell i dont know i just make this crap up as i go along
<Suprise> No Omega-Arceus-Ridley
<Ryanier128> any Apple technology hates me
<Biglaw> perhaps he should put the gun away before he misfires
<Ryanier128> I picked up and iPad 3 and it burst into flames
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Id rather just kill them quickly and get it over with.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Can they actually play games like WoW or Half life decently
<Dark_Horst> RX-78-SweetieBot: saying vats is for people who cant shoot is rather stupid
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I'm getting tired. Night everypony.
<Ryanier128> seeya ZappyTheUnicorn
<Invi|zombiefied> nighty ZappyTheUnicorn
<RX-78-SweetieBot> fine, VATS is for wimps.
<TheHoodyNinja> night Zappy
<Dark_Horst> RX-78-SweetieBot: becasue if you hit or not is determined mostly by how many skillpoints you have in the weapon category in fallout
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Apperently my dad wants to get me this http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air/select
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night Invi|zombiefied, Ryanier128, and TheHoodyNinja. :)
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> the thing costs about 1000 dollars
<Dark_Horst> RX-78-SweetieBot: have youn actually played the game?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> no, in new vegas you just need to hit them. your skill in the weapon category is for how much damage they do
*ninjaxmas becomes a master ninja!!! he is awarded with the Sword of Mignot a powerfull sword that harnesses the power of thunder
<scootminer> i got 10 peices of redstone

*ninjaxmas throws kunai at Ryanier128
*pyrocatboy throws the cheese at ninjaxmas.

*ninjaxmas takes the hoody and thanks TheHoodyNinja for being an epic teacher
<twilight_sprinkle> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: dude its free stuff. if theyre rich and its not hurting them financially, you shouldnt complain
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> They want to buy me a Macbook Air it costs from 1000 dollars to 1600 depending on the size of it
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> twilight_sprinkle: I doubt the Macbook air can actually play games on it well enough
*Ryanier128 can't decide if he should be happy for TheHoodyNinja or totally pissed off at him
<twilight_sprinkle> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: i have a crap computer from 7 years back which my father used, i dont ask for a new one
*Ryanier128 remembers he is a brony
<Invi|zombiefied> Omega-Arceus-Ridley buy what YOU want for yourself, not what your parents want
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Well I told him that and you know what he said?
<ehm> Omega-Arceus-Ridley : it's a thin laptop with an SSD, not a disk. Of course it has relatively small space and is expensive. >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: besides, i bet they dont want you to play games, which is why they getting mac
*hoodedxmasninja cuts Ryanier128 in half with a katana for throwing boomerang at him
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> He said do you want a computer that will last(the macbook) or a piece of garbage that will put out
<Invi|zombiefied> Omega-Arceus-Ridley does it matter what they say? xD

<hoodedxmasninja> Ryanier128: i get them i just like attacking you
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: for srs? i bought a custom PC for £800, nearly been a year and not a single problem
<Invi|zombiefied> twilight_sprinkle but he has the choice
<ehm> Omega-Arceus-Ridley : if you know how to take care of it, a "piece of garbagge" can last over a decade
<Ryanier128> ok
<Invi|zombiefied> ehm exactly
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Well apperently he thinks non mac comps are garbage
<TheHoodyNinja> Wow Shizuka has the WEIRDEST posts
<Biglaw> use wonderglue to fix the cruppled parts
<Chrysalis> GG l4d2ers
<Biglaw> crippled*
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi|zombiefied: theyre in charge of the money, they have the overruling vote, what can he do
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Its going to be MY computer I should have a fucking say in what I want
<Meanwhile> Covered in blood and puke and bits of skull fragment.
<Invi|zombiefied> twilight_sprinkle but you can take out of this conversation that Omega-Arceus-Ridley has the choice what he wants to buy (even if his parents don't seem to like non apple products)
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: are you more worried about the hardware or OS of the macbook?
<Invi|zombiefied> moin Meanwhile
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> My dad is a apple nut
<twilight_sprinkle> Invi|zombiefied: he can buy whatever he wants, true. but theyre the ones buying
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> he bought two of the newest ipads
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> cost enough for a new computer
<ehm> rose-colored glasses
<hoodedxmasninja> im out for now be back l8ter bye everypony
<Invi|zombiefied> twilight_sprinkle ya, that's right. but who cares what they think if you have the free choice ^^
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: hardware is a problem that any computer will face, but if im not mistaken (someone correct me if wrong) macs can have bootcamp, which allows windows to be installed as well
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I want something that can run well and actually play games
<Invi|zombiefied> Omega-Arceus-Ridley istead of a 1600 Mac crap, i would buy a awesome 1600 high end PC ^^
<Bronysith> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: get a great gaming pc mine cost like 1500 dollars
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i have a friend who has a mac, and he plays all his games through windows
<ehm> RainbowcrashNBurn : Yes, or Linux, BSD, etc.
<Bronysith> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: the secret is having it custom built
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Pff... Like Im going to get a say in what I want
<Biglaw> Kaboom
<Bronysith> life is complete http://cs11224.userapi.com/u12816927/-14/z_8a13a548.jpg
<cachi01> RainbowcrashNBurn: yeah what sucks about macs is their OS
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I'm 15-16 with no money or a job how am I going to get it custom built
<Bronysith> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: order the parts and have some guy build it
<Invi|zombiefied> Omega-Arceus-Ridley ignore your parents and choose the ''garbage'' if you want ^^
<Bronysith> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: have an asian build it
<cachi01> oooor get an alienware
<Monfang> What sorta food would ponies have for breakfast?
<ehm> Bronysith : I think he wanted a laptop. That's more tricky.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Im looking at the OS for the Air and it looks crap
<RainbowcrashNBurn> cachi01: the main thing i dont like about macs, is their obsession with having the weirdest mice imaginable
<Monfang> Maybe.. Oatmeal?
<Bronysith> ehm: ooh
<Bronysith> ehm: gaming laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03Nothing like sleeping in until 7pm, eh?
<Bronysith> ehm: never heard of such witchraft
<ehm> dunno
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder what apple uses instead of Excel
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Something called OS X Lion
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> It looks crap
<Meanwhile> Sounds cooler.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: pie they use pie
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: Oo
<Invi|zombiefied> Omega-Arceus-Ridley you choose what you want, show it your parents and if they want to argue, ignore them (as i said before) :)
<ehm> twilight_sprinkle : well, anyone can use LibreOffice
<RainbowcrashNBurn> twilight_sprinkle: macs can use microsoft office, but i think they also have own version
<Bronysith> macs arent good for gaming
<Meanwhile> If I had to pick blindly between Excel and OS X Lion, I'd pick the Lion.
<Skylands> 10Nothing like running the treadmill at 7pm, eh?
<Ryanier128> well, sh*t

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> We could be having interesting dialouge but Wrek has crap stats
<ehm> Omega-Arceus-Ridley : If you remember sonic 3, he fooled Knuckles into giving him the chaos emeralds. SonicAM, the dark cartoon, also had some devious schemes.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13LOL
<otakon> Wrek: WHY are you as perceptive as a blind dog?
<pyrocatboy> I'm getting a "legend of the dogman" vibe from this robot.

*Angel_Umbreon runs

*Meanwhile bonks icybeauti in the head with a cinderblock.
<icybeauti> Meanwhile: What?
<CCCP> ima go eat be back in like 10 mins
<Meanwhile> alexxm: dunno, perusing it as we speak.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> When he shoots his arm into the ground and pulls it out his leg goes up..apperently you can spindash under it
*icybeauti passes out from cinderblock

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I really wanted to fight the final boss of Sonic and Knuckles in 3d

<RainbowcrashNBurn> i wonder if theres ever gonna be proper levels in DLC for generations
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> How did he survive the station blowing up?

<RainbowcrashNBurn> that was close :O
*Omega-Arceus-Ridley is in a rage

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> oh bethesda you and your wonky physics
<Scootaloo_94> ded
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Oh god

<RainbowcrashNBurn> how do you cure addictions to the items and stuff?
<icybeauti> RainbowcrashNBurn: Get a therapist
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I assume these are dlc weapons?
<alexxm> not having them i think RainbowcrashNBurn
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> You talk to a doctor and he cures you for a price
<Meanwhile> Douchebag
<RX-78-SweetieBot> NCR has good people in it, but its government is horribly inefficant and corrupt. Mr. House just wants control of Vegas and the area around it. neither it really good or bad
<Meanwhile> Screw both of them, take Vegas yourself.
<Biglaw> how does a robot go unconsious?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> So because I have the desire to always be on the side of good, who should I side with?
<alexxm> malfunction BigLaw
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> FATALITY

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> That deathclaw's head esploded
<Biglaw> Haha! The Biglaw has been doubled!
<icybeauti> For realz?
<Biglaw> Mmhmm
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I wish I knew why I have this obsession to always be good
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: NCR or take over vegas yourself, although the ending for taking over yourself implies that the robot that helped you goes skynet
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I always feel bad when I act evil
<otakon> Wrek: I TOLD YOU DAMMIT!
<otakon> and ded
<otakon> Deathclaws are SNEAKY!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't see the reason, altough never knew him really well
<Meanwhile> Not as sneaky as Fel Reavers.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> otakon: how are such huge things sneaky as a ninja
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Meanwhile: Bear Reaver
<alexxm> what are deathclaws mutated from
<otakon> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: his head is crippled for one
<icybeauti> Or as nijas. Ther can be one behind you right now
<otakon> alexxm: Jackson Chameleon's

<otakon> I JUST SAID IT THREE TIMES LISTEN DAMMIT!
<Meanwhile> otakon x Jackson Chameleons

*otakon facepalms
<otakon> Wrek: you won't be able to run, just RETREAT for now!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: If you play things well and get on people's good sides you dont have to kill any of the smaller faction if you side with NCR or work for in independant Vegas.
<Lambo> I am really looking forward to Fighting is Magic and My Little Investigations
<Cayan> Lambo what are those
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> How the fuck does http://derpy.me/HRjLu TURN INTO THIS http://images.wikia.com/fallout/images/1/18/FNV_DeatclawAlpha.png
<Cayan> I know fighting is magic
<otakon> and ED-E is dead
<Lambo> Cayan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cC5v--qzXnw
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Some of the other mutations look possible
<alexxm> whats the second one Lambo i haven't heard of it
<otakon> Wrek: you can't without more/better gear
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> That thing from a lizard is insane
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Wrek: why the fuck did you think this was a good idea?
<otakon> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: it's a government experiment
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Wait..what
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> WUT
<otakon> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: bc like my cousin he pushes on despite having no chance of beating yet and HAVING the chance to go back and re-supply

<Airpuff> Wrek having problems? xD
<Kandarihu> I ask again. Is this Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas?
<otakon> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Shock Troopers
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Its like the pirates trying to control metroids
<otakon> Kandarihu: it's New Vegas
<icybeauti> God, watching too many PMVs

<Biglaw> Hi Gir!
<alexxm> hey Gir hows your day been
<Airpuff> Hi Gir =)
<pyrocatboy> icybeauti: What did you think of the song?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Killed the Dragon Priest at the end of the archmage of winterhold questline at level 6 using lightning and a steel sword.
<Gir> Good alexxm
<Meanwhile> While wearing robes.
<scootminer> what is that
<icybeauti> pyrocatboy: Pretty good
<alexxm> how'd you manage that Meanwhile
<otakon> Meanwhile: yfw the game still SCALES to you to a degree
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Meanwhile: want to know a ammusing physics glitch?
<otakon> THIS does NOT scale to low levels
<Gir> Watching TFOP
<Gunthler> GUYS, How many songs does Dashie sing by herself or duet? Only one i can think of is May The Best Pet Win...
<otakon> Wrek: it's a TRAP!
<Meanwhile> otakon: Yfw that dragon priest killed me in 2 hits like 70 times.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Meanwhile: use a raise dead spell on a dragon skelliton.. it goes flying
<Kandarihu> Does this game also take place 200 years after China nuked the U.S.?
<scootminer> u.s deserved it
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I may have forgotton but what was Sentinel Prime built for?
<Airpuff> xD
<otakon> Meanwhile: yeah, but Wrek has EVERYTHING crippled and no hard hitting weapons
<scootminer> veintan
<scootminer> veintam
<alexxm> theres her bit in at the gala Gunthler
<Meanwhile> otakon: All you need is a sword and lightning bolt.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Kandarihu: new vegas takes place a couple years after fallout 3
<otakon> Meanwhile: he's already has every disadvantage I can think of atm
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Meanwhile: LIGHTNING BOLT! *chucks cardboard*
<scootminer> veintam started cuz of comunisom
<Gir> lol
<Kandarihu> scootminer: according to the alternate history, the Vietnam war never happened.
<Gunthler> alexxm: Yeah, but thats with all of the Mane 6 tho... I just want only Dashie by herself or a duet...
<otakon> Wrek: don't forget to sell your crap in MISC!
<Biglaw> Squee! I can't wait to play ponymon :D
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Why was Sentinel prime built?
*Meanwhile uses cinderblock on Omega-Arceus-Ridley. Omega-Arceus-Ridley evolved into Omega-Cinder-Block
*Omega-Arceus-Ridley hits b
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: to fight the chinese
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> When was he supposed ot be done?
<Gir> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Meanwhile: TACO TRUCK! *chucks taco trick at*
<alexxm> i thought it would count Gunthler
<Litwick> STOP PRESSING BE OMEGA-ARCEUSRIDLEY I'M TRYING TO EVOLVE
<Meanwhile> Omega cinderblock sounds like a cinderblock designed to end life as we know it.
<otakon> yes
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: probably a few months after the nukes hit
<icybeauti> Mandows...
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> When was he actually finished?
*alexxm tickles TheRainbowDash
<otakon> kill it with FIRE!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> MANDOWS
<Airpuff> zS
<Kandarihu> Besides. We had a good reason to go to war in Vietnam. It was wrong to draft soldiers, and we were hit by a massive propaganda attack towards the end of the war which is why we were so villified.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Hahaha, that tickles!:D
<otakon> KILL THEM WITH FIRE!
<icybeauti> Cool story, but it needs more mandows
<Meanwhile> In the event of catastophic failure of planetary life forms, engage the omega cinderblock and prepare for returning of the planet into prime elements.
<Litwick> icy, no.
<scootminer> the veintam the iran and some other war was started by amarica and same cause comunisum
<Gir> Kill me with fire
<Litwick> Hey Wrek. Take a look in the chat.
<otakon> Wrek: you can fast travel BACK to the entrance of the Lonesome Road!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> it was supposed to be ready in 2077
<icybeauti> Litwick: I know you hate mandows. LOVE AND TOLERATE!
*alexxm sets Gir on fire
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> it was finished 200 years later
<otakon> you don't HAVE to go the long way!
<Gir> YAAAAAAAAAAAY~ IT BURNS
<Kandarihu> So could you please not be so bigoted about a country that some people in this country live in and actually appreciate?
*otakon facepalms
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> the tech Prime had was impressive for when it was built
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> It chucked nukes like footballs
<otakon> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: they WER footballs
<otakon> damn you typos
<scootminer> the other war wascuba also caused by amarica and comunisum
<Gir> LOL
<Meanwhile> otakon x WER
<scootminer> im a amrican i dont like amrica much
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I was sad when Liberty prime sacrificed himself
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Kandarihu: you are asking way too much of random people on the internet
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> He died for our sins
<Stardust_Phoenix> are you talking about korea
<Airpuff> ... I truly have NO idea what you guys are talking about o.o
<scootminer> i like the conditoiinds but the behaivor err.... no
<alexxm> inb4 deathclaws teaming up with bears
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> The blur when your head is crippled pisses me off
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> alexxm: everything is worse with bears
<icybeauti> :P
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Why cant we take ED-E with us?
<Kandarihu> Well, communist propaganda is everywhere nowadays, and we're kind of on the brink of it happening on a global scale. Please pardon me if I'm at least a little nervous about the death of freedom.
<alexxm> or whatever the bears in fallout are called Omega-Arceus-Ridley
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ohai Scoot-Scootaloo

<Airpuff> Dark92Enigma: I.. Am.. Not.. Jealous!!!!
<Meanwhile> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: there are, but they all look pretty much the same.
<Kandarihu> You know, the first amendment guarantees the right to peaceful assembly. But shutting down bridges, tunnels, and roads are not things that peaceful assemblies do.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: both
<Gir> brb
<icybeauti> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: You mean Storm and Jean, right?

<RX-78-SweetieBot> jeez, is everyone have internet troubles today?
<QT_Marks> hello, everyone :)
<ehm> Kandarihu : the usa completely misunderstood the desires of the vietnamese people (independence) and barely any of them knew their history. ho chi minh actually favored american ideals and was at versailles after ww2 to ask not to be a colony of france anymore. he was refused.
<Aurora> :>
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Can someone explain the whole catchign the boque thing to me?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> including me....
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Whats so special about it?
<Syrune> Hai :>
<alexxm> hey QT_Marks hows your day been
<QT_Marks> good thanks!
<icybeauti> Hello QT_Marks
<Litwick> Yeah, don't bother answering my question.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Litwick: it is
<QT_Marks> is the stream down or is it just on my end?
<Aurora> hhhhiiiii
<Litwick> oh, ok. I thought my internet was being a butt.
<Airpuff> For now x)
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I feel my pride is hurt due to the fact I lost to a fucking Blissy
<alexxm> you just missed it QT_Marks
<Syrune> How are you?
<Aurora> alright
<Airpuff> Blissy? pokemon right?
<Dark92Enigma> OK.....i bet everypony is sick and tired of hearing this but........Did TwiilightSparkle came here earlier? today's her birthday..........OK, i'll shut up
<icybeauti> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: My brother has a blissy with 666 hp
<Aurora> I have a ton of stuff i'm trying to get done in the next couple weeks
<Mika> bye ppl
<Dark92Enigma> 666?
<Aurora> I'm taking a break right now
<QT_Marks> ahh lol, just making sure
<icybeauti> Yes.
<Airpuff> Bye Mika
<Gir> bye Mika
<Syrune> Ah
<icybeauti> Bye Mika
<alexxm> not that i'm aware of Dark92Enigma
<alexxm> cya Mika
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Litwick: heres what I dont get, your blissy had fucking high defense but my aerial ace nearley destroyed it..whats up with that?
<Dark92Enigma> 6-6-6 The number of The Beast.........
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03My Blissey has max IV's and EV's on HP! :D
<icybeauti> Dark92Enigma: /)
<Dark92Enigma> Oh Ok alexxm.....
<deadeagle> FINALLY MY INTERNET IS BACK
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I never got the point of EV's and IV's
<alexxm> hey deadeagle hows your day been
<Litwick> Omega: The fuck are you talkng about?
<Derpy_Hooves> who's up next?
<Airpuff> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Talking pokemon? xD
<Dark92Enigma> NEXT-----
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Litwick: when we had our battle
<Gir> Derpy_Hooves: me
<deadeagle> scoot-scootaloo: on a which game
<QT_Marks> EV's and IV's were way to complicated for that game imo
<icybeauti> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: It's pretty complex actually. It's okay if you don't know about it.
<Litwick> Omega: We battled?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Oh wait we didnt wrong person
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> WHpp[s
<deadeagle> EVs were easier
<Kandarihu> I have to admit, we did make a lot of mistakes in the course of the Vietnam war. Pulling out at the time that we did was probably the worst by far.
<Airpuff> xDD
<Meanwhile> Well, my eyes are starting to hurt so it must be time to go to bed.
<deadeagle> IVs are a little confusing
<Chrysalis> 'night all
<Meanwhile> G'night everypony.
<Derpy_Hooves> who's streaming next?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I used to battle competitively during Gen4
<icybeauti> IV's are 10000000times more complex
<Dark92Enigma> 'Cause this is filler <--- Filler Time!
<alexxm> cya Meanwhile
<Chrysalis> o.0
<Airpuff> Good night Meanwhile
<Gir> Hot Cocoooooooooooooo
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> You know how Mewtwo is supposed to be menacing?\
<deadeagle> hes is?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Mine has a timid nature...it sounds ironic
<QT_Marks> IV's must be the part im remembering then
<Litwick> Omega: Blisseys have retardedly high SPECIAL defense. Blisseys have shitty PHYSICAL DEFENSE. And since Aerial Ace is a physical move.... do the math.
<QT_Marks> I haven't played in quite some time
<Airpuff> Here this will help ya sleep meanwhile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA34YhfDMIw
<icybeauti> EV's are effort values, I forgot what IV stood for.
<deadeagle> natures and EVs are the main things i pay attention to
<Airpuff> xD
<Dark92Enigma> Omega-Arceus-Ridley Mewtwo was Awesome!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> My mewtwo is special
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Guess why it is
<Kandarihu> If you ever wondered why we wee in Iraq for so many years after Saddam Hussein died, it was probably to prevent a repeat of the end of the Vietnam War.
<Gir> I want hot cocoooo
<deadeagle> IV is individual value
<icybeauti> Oh yeah
<deadeagle> cant be changed over time, its when you catch it i think
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ohai LunaTheBeloved
<Dark92Enigma> Oh hai again Gir!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I had a video of myself playing competitively over Pokemon Battle Revolution!
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> My mewtwo knows Aura Sphere
<LunaTheBeloved> Cell eberypony
<LunaTheBeloved> *everypony
<Gir> hi Dark92Enigma lol
<icybeauti> EV's come with the nature and IV's come with things like "likes to eat"
<deadeagle> scoot-scootaloo: LINK? O_O
<pikorar> Gir? Are you GirDash?
<pikorar> Or is it GilDash?
<Airpuff> Seriously.. what are you talking about? When i read.. its suddenly about some random war, or about pokemon.. xD
<Gir> pikorar no
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Timid is a good nature for my mewtwo it boosts special attack
<Dark92Enigma> Link: Excuuuuuse me princess!
<icybeauti> Gir So many Invader Zim images are flooding my mind
<RX-78-SweetieBot> wb woona
<pikorar> Gir: Your name is familiar is all.
<deadeagle> EVs are based on nature and points, different pokemon killed give different EVs
<Gir> pikorar: meh
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhzwnkWYjx4&list=FLUTJAI-vpHNAYH9eOVmrZSw&index=54&feature=plpp_video
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I also have a Viticini with Fusion Flare,Fusion Bolt, and V Create
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm Sculp20 on it
<Gir> icybeauti: yeah ^^
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I feel OP
<deadeagle> IVs if i am correct, are set when you catch them
<Ryunosuke> okay that sucked :)
<icybeauti> To put it simply, If you kill a certain pokemon with say, a high attack stat, an EV for attack would add to your pokemon
<deadeagle> oh fail
<Ryunosuke> storm passed by about an hour 15 minutes ago, just NOW lost power :p
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Is there anyway to tell if a shiny is legit?
<deadeagle> you still have link scoot? my thing crashed
<Gir>
<icybeauti> Ryunosuke: I woke up at 5am to the sound of thunder
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I set my xbox to redownload all the borderlands dlcs, although it keeps disconnecting
<Shamroc> oh ello there LunaTheBeloved
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I used to love the pokemon anime
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> I stopped after season 2

<otakon> Wrek: you going to bed man?
<deadeagle> anyway ima catch up on farming in rotmg -_-
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> The reason why Pikachu lost to a SNIVY THAT NEVER BATTLED BEFORE is retarded
<otakon> rotmg?
<icybeauti> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Pokemon logic
<Litwick> Who said ROTMG?
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> It kept him from using electic attacks
<WallDives> Hi all.
<deadeagle> realm of the mad god? :D
<QT_Marks> he was obsessed with finding any shiny for a few years, and he got bidoof. i dont think he's touched pokemon sinse
<otakon> suddenly I come back to pokemon discussions
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Im pretty sure Pikachu still knows Irontail
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, any stream right now?

<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Stupid substitute/leech seed ploy
<icybeauti> OOHHH
<RyunosukeKnT> umm, I want to say loudred with some sort of block move works wonders
<Litwick> It's because Cottonees/Whismicotts are fucking trolls.
<RyunosukeKnT> something with soundproof and block ;)
<NightSeas> 02ohai Aurora
<WallDives> also, Best match was either Punk/Jericho or Brian/Lawler.

<Bronysith> OMG
<Airpuff> Seems i managed to roll' some of ya
<StinkomanFan> The weapon that lets you see enemy health?
<Linkerman> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: Oh yeah? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4m4lnjxkY
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> that spore low kick spam made me so angry...
<Bronysith> the meet the pyro video is finnaly released http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4m4lnjxkY
<Aurora> again it depends
<StinkomanFan> I mean, I found it randomly dropped
<Airpuff> Take it away Fluttershy!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTZctTG6cE
<WallDives> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: It was supposed to be Spore/Focus Punch...
<Aurora> 2D traditional, 2D digital, Flash
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs She's flutterlicious
<WallDives> I screwed it up though.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> You still managed to kick my ass
<Rocklobster> guys theres no stream
<Airpuff> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: daw.. xD
<WallDives> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: you were also using a SEVERLY underleveled team.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww0ecdhL6n8&feature=related Check this out...this was so well done
<NightSeas> 02well I know 2D traditional is manual
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Nope, no stream.
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> WallDives: I was trying to stay near your level
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Everyone go to sleep :)
<Aurora> yep
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Apperently that was my downfall
<Linkerman> Time to go to bed!
<Aurora> 2D digital is mostly manual, it's possible to make some of it generated
<RyunosukeKnT> Omega-Arceus-Ridley: SQUEEEEEEEEE
<Rocklobster> um its the afteroon over here
<Linkerman> Everyone sleep ಠ_ಠ
<Aurora> Flash is half and half, depending on how you use it
<NightSeas> 02ah
<WallDives> I mean, considering the circumstances, you did good.
<Airpuff> NEVER! You cannot force me!:[
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> the guy who made that animation of doomsday zome got a job at bioware
<Rocklobster> :'(
<ScootaSleep> 00,03Ahhh shhooo~
<TheRainbowDash> Bye ScootaSleep! Silly filly...:D
<WallDives> Also, I need to grind my levels, but I dont know where...
<Linkerman> Airpuff: You don't wanna make Fluttershy cry do you? :(
<WallDives> also, its too early for sleep.
<LunaTheBeloved> I had forgotton how much I love Borderlands
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1855/

<Bronysith> better than sopranos still
<otakon> my USB derped again
<Airpuff> .... You make fluttershy cry by making her go to bed :'(
<Aurora> flash is annoying unless you use it for digital 2D animation
<Aurora> I don't use it for standard flash animation
<WallDives> I guess theres a lot of Fluttershy fans here...
<Linkerman> NUUUU Fluttershy cried!
<WallDives> she is OP though.
<Rocklobster> :'(
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMPBmt3IvPI&feature=relmfu And this is why Gilda was never seen again
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the DLCs gave it a good ending

<Bronysith> everytime fluttershy cries A PUPPY DIES
<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah

*Bronysith has a rape face
<otakon> although considering close to a million people would jump to her defense in a instant is saying something however.
<WallDives> weak and helpless doesnt get a instant kill attack.

<Aurora> back to your earlier question
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3181/
<WallDives> otakon: Master Pugs/Tonberrys arent weak.
<Aurora> I can't think of any actual terms for the matter
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3181/
<Omega-Arceus-Ridley> Fluttershy is angry! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0emeaSF6uPY&feature=relmfu
<Aurora> I'm not sure why it was so important for you to know
<otakon> WallDives: but they are CUTE looking
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2042/
<WallDives> otakon: cute was never in the discussion.
