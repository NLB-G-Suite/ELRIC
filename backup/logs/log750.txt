<Zack> Interesting horn, it wraps around the pone.
<SirGanjalf> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Kurra> Wonderbolts are only power, no impulse/torque :p
<OohShiny> OCTAVIA
<Shadec> Was that Colgate with that weird face?
<SirGanjalf> awww
<Ponies47> I should do this if I go to a fancy party XD
<Requiem> Octy
<pony_5797> Please, your embrassing yourself :$
<AJIsAwesome> MFW I remember a terrible dub of this song
<lowfn> Poor Pinkie.
<Shadec> By the statue?
<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaaaaaww <3
<Mahboi> aa aa aaAAAAaAAA

<CrystalPhoenix> THEN things went downhill from here
<Excadrill> I wuv Pinkie Pie <3
<WindyCityNative> Asshole
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: which one was it?
<Requiem> Lol
<Dark92Enigma> BLUE*
<princess-loveless> his cutie mark should be a mirror
<Lyra-Heartstrings> Adorable
<Mishia> DONT REMIND ME THAT HIS VOICE IS DEAD SEXY
<pony_5797> bastard
*jackdoe720 gags
<OohShiny> so... Prince? why aren't you an alicorn?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> No it doesnt!
<pony_5797> Fk u eyes
<MerkelJerkel> >_> I hate Blueblood
<Zack> NO! I MENT THE OTHER ROSE
<SirGanjalf> Prince DoucheBag
*PonyJoe checks the leaderboards. BLUEBLOOD!
<pony_4908> yay
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: I forgot what language it was.
<lowfn> Goes with your douchebaggery.
<AlienWarhead> Is his cutie mark a compass mark?
<Kurra> Blueblood's voice is so foreign to me now o.o
<pony_3290> I AM A ELEPHANT!
<Mishia> I HATE HIS GUTS TO MUCH
<twilight_sprinkle> barrack obama!
<Dark92Enigma> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYUP
<lowfn> His hat reminds me of a peanut.
<OJ> You've got a pretty lame cutie mark, blueblood.
<Mahboi> LOL
<yinyangtang> hes so self centered,its so hilarious
<TehWaffle> goofy's hat
<pony_5797> Fk that guy too, he tricked fluttershy
<DocSane> I think only girls can be alicorns.
<The_cake_is_a_pie> HE HAS NO CUTIE MARK
<EventHorizon> >says it goes with his eyes, then closes them so we can't immediately compare them.
<The_cake_is_a_pie> WADAFUQ
<Prince_Blueblood> you people are going to piss me off.
<OohShiny> a Kangaroo?

<pony_6615> :(
<Jageman> Wallaroo?
<CrystalPhoenix> you're such a loudmouth
<SirGanjalf> "And a Rat monkey"
<Doctor> YOUR MINE!!!
<Shadec> Blueblood isn't a alicorn because he's adopted, and the reason he's such an asshole is cause he had a very troubled childhood before he was adopted into royalty.
<Mishia> BLOOOOOOOOOOOO BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
<DocSane> I'm also convinced at this point that what we call an "alicorn" is officially a "princess pony".
<Excadrill> WALLAROOOOOO
*jackdoe720 laughs at Prince_Blueblood

<otakon> butler: no idea
<TehWaffle> Is there a ponified Black Butler opening?
<Jageman> thelonepony: bye, see you tomorrow morning.
<J_E_Smith71> OohShiny: You said "If it exists, there's a pony version of it." Rule 2010 on that page: There is a ponified version of it. No exceptions.
<TrixieMuffin> Game of Ponies is out there too
<Saturn> 08,01Marksmen16: it's rather rude to demand, no?
<pony_3813> what is this?
<jackdoe720> Eeeyup, it's about time to head out. Have a good night, all.
<OohShiny> butler: because you can't accept this fandom part?
<otakon> TehWaffle: look and you'll probably find one
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, jackdoe720.
<jackdoe720> ty, AJ. :)
<OohShiny> J_E_Smith71: the rule 34.2 says 'there are ponies of it'
<Kandarihu> I wonder if a ponified version of the 2nd opening to Macross Frontier could be workable.
<butler> sorry. was that harsh?
<Eddmario> Okay, there's apparently a bug with this chat when using firefox: if you type somehting into the chat you sometimes can't click the URL bar
<GeneralKai> I actually cant find a comment for that last thing.
<OohShiny> dis
<djpon3y> ohh yeay
<J_E_Smith71> OohShiny: The hell? They have it on their twice then!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yay
<Hunter> FIW

<Boxman> I haven't seen this one.
<Hunter> but it's pretty good.
<Lightning_Bolt> thanks sweet celestia
<ISky> Star Waving Mad
<DaringDerpy> which episode? is this one new?
<GeneralKai> Seriously, a puppet show twilight.
<ISky> it's a short
<J_E_Smith71> OohShiny: Rule 34.2 and Rule 2010 are the same thing
<pony_4908> What'
<pony_6615> pick one
<The_cake_is_a_pie> IS THIS NUMBER 8?
<ISky> it was premiered at Everfree Northwest
<Eddmario> Random fact: Scootaloo's line in this was changed a bit from the Everfree Northwest viewing
<pony_4908> What's the name of that dog that follows you around?
<AJIsAwesome> :S
<Hunter> This is just a short.
<GeneralKai> Screw off scootaloo.
<SpirittHooves> do not question the rues of the internet
<Hunter> xd
<The_cake_is_a_pie> is this episode 8?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Mommy?
<pony_6615> does that mean there's a pony version of 34.2?
<Stellafera> The "Everybody is a jerk to Spike" thing is getting kinda old though
<Pinkies4thWall> OH MY GOD THIS IS NEW
<TehWaffle> No ponified black butler :'(
<The_cake_is_a_pie> I haven't seen this
<pony_1921> <_<

<Kandarihu> The_cake_is_a_pie, I think it's more like 7.5
<ISky> it's relatively new, but not episode 8
<Eddmario> PaladinDrakkenwolf: In the Everfree Northwest version, she said "big sister"
<pony_5797> so she needs a mommy
<TehWaffle> Bow ties are cool
<otakon> poor Spike

<richfiles> I like it... Not chipmunked though...
<Ponies47> Native-Warrior: You seem to hate everything so get out
<OmgItsVinylScratch> Shadowbolts <3

<Dashie_Dashie> She is goddamn sexy though.
<Polydunami> Neutron, Electron :D
<WinterTide> always in bollywood there has to be a song:)
<Amaron> Did he just say electrons?
<reinier> is this honestly a full length movie?
<Dashie_Dashie> I will admit.
<Kencolt> Yes. It's Bollywood, or damn close. Only there do musical numbers appear for no rational reason... ans still somehow FIT.
<paw263> they definately just said "electron"
<AdamTheDuck> Sumica, XD

<Icy_Burst> what is this called?
<Ponymon> I think it's called The Robot.

<anony_pony> ShadowDude: hes probably in a musical number in the end
<ponymanwmv> LOL
<Page_Turner> and discord.
<I_Love_Sana> oh... oh my
<ISky> it's The Robot, in Tamil -- Enthiran iirc
<Rotanimood> im not sure how to act
<Biltzwing> All the robots are PINKIES
<Dark_Horst> did he just say kilimanjaro?
<[Alpha]> and written by Twilight Sparkle
<Icy_Burst> what is this called?
<pony_5189> MLP needs a Bollywood episode
<Reaper> Catchy song at least.
<I_Love_Sana> sweet celestia
<Icy_Burst> what is this called?
<DiscSlash> "so many pinkie pies"
*anony_pony clop clop clop
<Alcoholicorn> this movie would give twilight an anuerysm
<pony_4908> Yeah, the next musical number takes place at Mt. Kilimanjaro.

<anony_pony> I HAVE BEATEN MY HIGHSCORE
<CCharmanderK> O_o
<Kimori> woah
<Ryunosuke> singing about a mountain in africa, while in south america, in an indian movie
<richfiles> Dang... just noticed my tablet's clock hasn't changed in 3 hours... I suppose it crashed :D
<CCharmanderK> The fuck is this?!
<Ryunosuke> seems par for course
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Alcoholicorn: lol she would :D

<Biltzwing> ALL THE EXTRAS ARE PLAYED BY PINKIE PIE
<Ponymon> So, I have a question. Is the chat going to be open for the livestream tommorrow? Because it wasn't last week.
<CCharmanderK> Bollywood films confuse me.
<Derpeye> After the kilimanjaro movie there will be a movie at mt. everest
<I_Love_Sana> jumping guy
<ShadowDude> so when is the robot going to invade?
<pony_3794> it's an Indian movie, nothing ever has to make sense

<Sundaysmile> movie is only half way through
<Sumica> 00,10Ponymon, it was an error with the irc network
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Derpeye: lol i wouldnt be suprised :D
<Kencolt> T%his is Bollywood. relevance between thye main plot (such as there is) and random Acts of Musical Numbers is not merely optional-- it's often actively discouraged.
<Dark_Horst> guys, you know that nobody is forcing you to watch? stop being a bunch of little shits
<Sumica> 00,10the IRC ops have said they fixed it
<ShadowDude> this song is so long
<Reaper> This is a long song.

<Ponymon> I'm... not sure what to think of this, honestly. On one hand, it's an awesome movie. On the other, it feels like it's saying "Don't think, blidly do as you're told." But that's probably just me taking the ending too literally
