<twilight_sprinkle> irl tennis is way mpre fun than wii tennis though, although its less accessible ofc
<GilDash> ... You're not supposed to seel mature games to kids in the first place... right?
<Vordox> Sumica: The only issue I had was the damn blinking
<The_Awesomeness> this is just like back in the 80's when people thought rock was making kids become psycopaths
<Silver_Soother> CriticKitten: That's awesome. I had one teacher that made movie quotes ALL the time. (Even let us watch movies and play games in his Study Hall.) How he manged that, I dunno, but it was AMAZING. Lol.

<Silver_Soother> AJIsAwesome: That teacher actually got me into Adam Sandler movies, which lead me to get into legit GOOD movies. He really shaped me into the person I am right now.

<Cypresswolf> I remember a few times my Grandma came to visit while in the middle of a game of GTA - my how she laughed about how naughty I was running people over :)
<twilight_sprinkle> oh wow, going to a video game convention to ban video games, that mustve ended well
<Lyra`> it taught me how to kill.
<SirGanjalf> But 3rd person shooters are OK?
<soulrider95> Wrek: You mean hacked PoS

<Shizuka> 13look at the pictures
<MadSurge> donutpop365: "un bambino" means "a (male) child"

<MadSurge> Sumica: Borderlands has that.

<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: Well go shoot up a school.
<Sumica> 00,10they all have blood
<DashWithRainbows> I take pleasure of ruining things
<Vordox> Eli: But too much to take into right now, I'm still slightly confused on why FPS is such a attentive game.

<Xaiden> Online Gameplay BITCH
<Conyst> Minecraft brings out the worst killers.
<Vordox> Eli: It depends completely on the reason you play, from either the social aspect, the game aspect, or the player themselves and their experience on the relationt o the aestethics.

<cachi01> Tovler: i think the MLP fandom is bigger
<J_E_Smith71> I prefer fantasy games like Mario, Sonic, Mega Man, Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, etc
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: his stances were horrible, the only reason he wasnt knocked off his ass from recoil is cause hes a fatty
<Mega_Milk> Nittany_Discord: It was probably on a stand.

<Shizuka> 13with that sandbag there he should have used that for support
<Shizuka> 13and the shoulder
<Xaiden> Wait til you fire a 30/30 or a .12 gauge, then he'll really know how it feels to fire a gun
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk lolwhynot
<Nobsi> i totally agree to twilight-sprinkle
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: cheater noob
<Conyst> It also hit his face.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He probably didn't hit anything with that failure.
<Sumica> 00,10he hit ground
<RaveBrony> Looked like it
<DashWithRainbows> MadSurge Too bad I done the same :>
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: He flinched like a kitteh to a spray bottle at just the noise.
<cachi01> look at dat duke spinning around
<DashWithRainbows> MW2 trolling was an all time favourite of mine.
<Sumica> 00,10he had the gun aimed so low the shot probably bounced off the ground
<Shizuka> 13yeah the barrel swung low, that'd hit ground
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohh
<CriticKitten> Parents, informing themselves? MY GOD
<ASoftFluffyThing> At least he didn't shoot his eye out.
<MadSurge> DashWithRainbows: I tried COD multiplayer, I prefer TF2 :D
<Tovler> MLG on a Mac
<Shizuka> 13school video game teams...
<Shizuka> 13FUND IT NOW
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, the recoil destroyed his aim anyway.
<Mega_Milk> ^
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: Oh come on, there was a police officer there.
<twilight_sprinkle> no
<Brony_Pony26> emmm what the fuck is happening
<Vordox> ^^^^
<Eli> VGHS?
<cachi01> ^^^^^^^^^^{
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I agree! :D
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: he couldve hurt himself pretty badly

<Bronysith> Shizuka: my school has started that...slowly

<Chrysalis> dat perspective
<Rosfox> o.o
<AVS619> yea fuck football
<Alister> But I like football
<Shizuka> 13i can't imagine baseball is much better

<Metronome> Fuq Sports
<Xaiden> AVS619: SPEAK THE TRUTH BROTHA
<Nobsi> i like that show what its name?
<Sumica> 00,10big woop penn I have died atleast that much in PS2 already
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: He could, if he weren't supervised by a trained person
<SirGanjalf> *wasn't
<AVS619> you knoe it
<cachi01> you get it? playing any madden game is bad and you should feel bad
<MadSurge> Shizuka: better play european football, aka soccer :D
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: he hit himself as it is :\
<AVS619> *know
<Mega_Milk> I took some light spinal damage and a broken leg playing football. And I got several twisted ankels from basket ball.
<Shizuka> 13and now for the gut punch
<Shizuka> 13and the best damn mom ever
<Silver_Soother> Shizuka: makes me sad....
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: See.

<CriticKitten> .... ;_;
<Lyra`> T-T
<AVS619> poor kid
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Sensitive.
<Bronysith> christ
<Alister> SCREW YOU JACK !
<Rosfox> Poor kid
<alexxm> poor kid
<Vordox> Evidence enough, world?
<twilight_sprinkle> Mega_Milk: i got kicked in the balls soooo many times playing football
<Brony_Pony26> what did he kill
<Dken2021> oh.... that part?
<Buytoast> wait, he crying because the recoil hurt him or what?
<Lyra`> they said sorry.
<Nerom> Manly tears was shed
<Metronome> poor kid
<Lyra`> so its okay.
<twilight_sprinkle> Mega_Milk: soccer i mean
<Sumica> 00,10guns are scary
<The_Awesomeness> fuck u jack
<Mega_Milk> twilight_sprinkle: Your supposed to have a cup! >:3
<Bronysith> ALL IN FAVOR OF Stapling Jack Thompsons organs to an NES
<TheMaster> guns are -not- scary
<Sumica> 00,10especaly to a kid
<Rommulus> Manly tears.
<Chrysalis> Guns are really bucking scary
<Buytoast> ah, fair enough
<Lyra`> guns are scary, thats why im a medic :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Mega_Milk: high school soccer :P
<Conyst> Go to bed Wrek.
<TheMaster> guns teach responsibility
<Vordox> Sumica: And I revert back to, Spec Ops the Line. :P
<spud> what happend i only rejoined
<Brony_Pony26> what now
<Mega_Milk> Guns arent a joke.
<Silver_Soother> P&T said sorry, more then Jack would EVERY do for all the crap hes done.
<RDash5000> sup guys ._.
<CriticKitten> He was probably scared out of his mind, real guns are really scary shit, man.
<Shizuka> 13Buytoast: and that he was supposed to aim at a picture of humans
<cachi01> he cried because he got scared or what?
<Lyra`> its just a kick, and a hole in something there.
<Everlasting_Joy> I confess, it is fun to shoot at a range at targets of paper.
<Chrysalis> seriously, even if you never fire a real gun
<twilight_sprinkle> but yeah, idiotic dcision to let the kid shhot
<TheMaster> everyone should get a chance to shoot a gun. Guns are simply a tool and in responsible hands are no more dangerous than a knife or a fork
<Chrysalis> get an AirSoft GBB piston
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: No
<Mega_Milk> twilight_sprinkle: Ohhhhhh.....ouch -lol
<Brony_Pony26> sup RDash5000
<AVS619> ima stick with airsoft
<MadSurge> Sumica: that's why I don't want any real gun around :(
<Dark_Horst> dat sandscreen
<Chrysalis> pistol*
<Vordox> It was NOT idiotic
<spud> what happend i only rejoined
<Tovler> lucky kid. I didn't get to fire a gun until I was 18
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RDash5000. :)
<RDash5000> what did i miss?
<Lyra`> ive been shooting since i was 5
<Chrysalis> the kick of the damn things is terrifying
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: Ok i call that back. It doesn't seem that dangerous(physically) at the moment
<Xaiden> AVS619: Don't be a pussy, shoot a 30-30, BE A MAN
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: it was. he hurt himself and ended up crying
<TheMaster> I don't see whats scary about a gun, the only thing scary is a irresponsible person holding a gun.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: But what did he learn?
<Sumica> 00,10dont blame you MadSurge. Dont agree with you but I dont blame you
<Bronysith> i liked that football argument he did
<sub06905|TARDIS> silent stream is silent
<Nerom> Gnight everypony
<Buytoast> it did seem to pack a pretty powerful punch
<Brony_Pony26> tf2
<AVS619> the first gun i shot was a 16 gauge shotgun
<Tovler> 18-40 I was such a lousy shot
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Nerom. :)
<Dken2021> so, how it's going for everyone?
<Bronysith> Buytoast: its an assault rifle man
<Shizuka> 13Chrysalis: there was a cork pistol thing at the state fair too, i did horribly at that...
<MadSurge> YES
<Silver_Soother> Rubberfruit. <3
<MadSurge> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: still too early, hes just 9. if he were at least 11-12
<AJIsAwesome> Dat Rubberfruit :D
<Xaiden> dafuq?
<Shizuka> 13rifle you can spread the support along your arm, pistol it's just all there at your hands
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Welcome to reality
<Lyra`> ?
<RDash5000> RUBBERFRUIT!!!!
<spud> what happend? i only rejoined
<AVS619> dafuq is this
<MadSurge> AND THEN
<Everlasting_Joy> A demon exorcism?
<Rommulus> dafaq?
<Lyra`> legend of zelda?
<Chrysalis> Shizuka i used to airsoft alot, i have a full-weight m14-EBR
<DashWithRainbows> Must be Rubberfruit
<MadSurge> :D
<Chrysalis> the sniper version
<Lyra`> thats odd.
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: Yep
<MadSurge> BOOM
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<Xaiden> Ah the usual SFM film
<Bronysith> hey Wrek can i get a link to that vid please? i could really use some of that stuff in a class report i have to do
<AJIsAwesome> DAT WALKING ANIMATION
<RDash5000> seeya GilDash
<Conyst> night GilDash
<MadSurge> Well, that happened
<spud> night gildash
<Dken2021> noght GilDash
<AJIsAwesome> Night, GilDash :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night GilDash
<Chrysalis> and my pistol has enough kick that someone unprepared has dropped it before
<MadSurge> Night GilDash!
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: what reality, where some biased morons hurt a kid to prove their point? also theres no guarantee at all he learned anyhting. he might grow up wanting to get a second chance, and to be "manly" cause he screwed up as a kid
<Chrysalis> and those things dont even fire real rounds
<Xaiden> dafuq?
<Mega_Milk> I fired my first .45 when I was 8. I fired my first shotgun at 14. And my first rifle at 15.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: YOu think so? Or you know so?
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: Doubt that seeing his family...
<AVS619> so confuse
<sub06905|TARDIS> what is happening
<Chrysalis> you must be a redneck
<Eli> where have i heard the music before?
<J_E_Smith71> Magical Quest music? That was a random choice
<Dark_Horst> all you americans and your weaponry
<Conyst> Steampunk pyro.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: its a very common situation, especially seeing how it was shown on TV. i can easily see him wanting to prove himself now
<Dark_Horst> the only real ammunition i ever fired were 3 .22 rounds
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: family only has so much influence
<MadSurge> I'm going to bed too guys. Goodnight
<Wrek> 05pfft guns
<Wrek> 05i use an axe
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: The earlier, the better. Just saying
<Bronysith> i fired 9mm, and .357
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night MadSurge
<Dark_Horst> i was19 at that point
<AJIsAwesome> Night, MadSurge. :)
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Yes, the show is biased. But it provides an alternative perspective on things that don't often GET that perspective.
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek why not your fists?
<Bronysith> Wrek: i prefer katana
<MadSurge> Also DAT HENRY HATSWORTH
<spud> what happend?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i mean i agree that video games dont cause violence, but the show is absurd
<Bronysith> Wrek: but same thing, we never run out of bullets
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: My weapon of choice is a chain saw. But axe is a deffinate second.
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: Family is still the biggest influece.
<Jmo> I prefer a trout.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: That I cannot deny :P
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And that's part of a proper discussion, knowing both sides.
<Everlasting_Joy> "(Ganon) You will die!"
<MadSurge> :O
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Rommulus> Yoooouuu Shalll not PPPPAAAASSSSS

<MadSurge> BINDING OF ISAAC MUSIC
<Xaiden> Ah Gmod, Forgotten as a relic upon the release of SFM
<RDash5000> guns are fun if treated with respect
*Everlasting_Joy is licked by Bronysith :).
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: true, but im rather displeased with them hurting that kid to prove their point
<Vordox> rdash: No
<spud> what happend?
<Tovler> man. This Huffington Post site is trashy.
<Vordox> RDash5000: Never, no, and not ever again
*Nittany_Discord 11,01puts Bronysith in a maid corset
<Jmo> It isn't forgotten
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: yeah but kids also tend to rebel against biggest influences
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: can you pull on the strings please? i cant seem to reach em
<Dken2021> watch out, it's a manni manni statue
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sure *pulls strings*
<Xaiden> Christian brutal sniper?
<AVS619> what the actual fuck
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: why thank you. my i do look fabulous

<DashWithRainbows> wut
*Vordox dodges.
<Everlasting_Joy> Even dead, he brings his manly moustache.
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a maid corset and pulls lightly on the strings
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: besides, they didnt mention a lot of things, like how games actually help release built up anger, and how tv is a stronger influence at times
<Dark_Horst> but honestly, i'd love to get my hands on the trigger of an lmg one day. if only to find out if my shoulder could take it without breaking^^
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys,back.wuts this?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I think the kid will be fine. He likely learned something that day that will help him in the future, and his mother approved of the experience.
<Bronysith> Butterfly revolver?
<AVS619> NO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks. <3
<DashWithRainbows> Now I have evidence for Bronysith x Nittany_Discord

<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: He can rebel in many more, easier ways later.
<Jmo> You don't wanna do dat.
<Xaiden> What song?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he probably will be fine, but it couldve been worse plus like i said, he might growing up wanting a second chance, after getting, as some douches might tell him, humiliated on tv
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: did it really take you that long to figure out?
<Sumica> 00,10what's that DashWithRainbows?

<Jmo> I sense butthurt.
<DashWithRainbows> Maybe, if I have the time.

<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: That's my point - his parents seem to have goo contact with him, so i doubt that incident will affect him that much later.
<SirGanjalf> *good
<Dark_Horst> good for zombie-rabbit apocylpses, but not much else
<Petrified_Discord> Shizuka: That's pretty fast.

*Saturn 08,01hugs NewDCD
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah I think the reason they went with OCs instead of the Mane 6 was because they didn't want them to make them "OOC" and twist them to their liking or something

<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: I see, 1. I seem to have an insufficient definition of roleplay, if you can define it so it can be avoided in the future, that would be great. 2. Then I will work harder than ever before so I may prove myself worthy! The act itself seems insignificant, but you allowed me access to one of the most fun places on the internet! That is no small action. If it makes you happy, I can tone down the fanatacism a bit though...

<thisguy> O.O
<AJIsAwesome> That was actually one of the most pointless forms of fanservice I've ever seen.
<thisguy> i cant help but wonder who originally came up with that scene :O
<fluttercry> 05,15It's so awkward
<ASoftFluffyThing> Why would fans want to see someone hump a table?
<theprovencher> i found it
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: I have NO idea. :S
<Pinkies4thWall> Code MENT is best code

<Dken2021> ASoftFluffyThing becuse vampire

<DerpyMuffins> "Fine"?
<thisguy> um, that's the spirit? o.O
<twilight_sprinkle> this edited btw
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: Actually, until recently, Absinthe was illegal almost everywhere... the French wine industry in the late 1800's/early 1900's did a HUGE smear campaigm against it, claiming it drove people insane. Actually, the problem was people were buying it insteaad of wine.
<RaveBrony> :o

<NocturnalBlade> god i love you Discord ^_^

<RaveBrony> Oh?
<DerpyMuffins> Really?
<weeping_pegasi82> you should have that echoing laugh as your ringtone
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<DerpyMuffins> I seen her aura change like 4 times
<RaveBrony> Ill look at that more closely :o
<Dken2021> never noticed that
<AJIsAwesome> I'd actually like to see Discord act mores serious if he returns. He can be VERY intimidating when he is.
<twilight_sprinkle> mmmmagik

<RaveBrony> This is just great :D
<superretroworld> omg its not like we can get guards to help
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: That's one of the flaws I like about Twilight. She tends to overthink things.
<thisguy> lmao even without his voice, discord still cracks me up :D
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: What exactly would the guards do?
<Sumica> 00,10his expresions are great
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<DerpyMuffins> I feel like Im watching mimes
<RaveBrony> That reused heroic/friendship music
<weeping_pegasi82> poor fluttershy
<twilight_sprinkle> well, a giant labyrinth did spawn outside the castle, so it made sense thats where the elements would be
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: atleast something, they never do anything
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Wait, wasn't the lab there to begin with?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: idk
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought it wasnt
<twilight_sprinkle> since it goes away
<Sumica> 00,10I love the discord starting trouble theme
<twilight_sprinkle> after theyre done
<DerpyMuffins> Yea, follow the moving apples, makes sense
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: But when they do, they can't really accomplish anything.
<thisguy> never knew about the labyrinth before the episode
<Sumica> 00,10it's like wimsical yet mennacing
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: ik, which is why i feel bad for them
<DerpyMuffins> Never knew about the magic aura rule till now
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Same, but that's the curse of most guards in tv shows.
*Dken2021 quit *mwah* Goodnight everybody
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Same.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Dken2021. :)
<Dken2021> whoops
<NocturnalBlade> nite Dken2021
<thisguy> night Dken, dream of ponies tonight :)
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: ik, poor guards :D
<twilight_sprinkle> im not sure the magic color rule is proven though
<Malk> I have a secret
<AJIsAwesome> What is it, Malk? :)
<Malk> I like ponies
<Sumica> 00,10how so twilight_sprinkle?
<thisguy> me too <3
<NocturnalBlade> Malk: i did not know that >_>
<Sumica> 00,10ew ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: idk i dont have a very good memory, but i thought there was one pony who didnt have a match, im not sure. it mightve been that pony who was making the peanut bitter sandwich
<Malk> cool NoccturnalBlade
<twilight_sprinkle> *butter

<Sumica> 00,10then again do we see that ponies cutie mark
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Kurra. :)
<Kimori> its been a slow day here
<twilight_sprinkle> i think we do
<thelonepony> Hi Kurra :)
<Kurra> hi alla you :>
<twilight_sprinkle> oh wait or maybe that was the theory about their eyes matching
<p4ngya> <_<
<p4ngya> >_>
<thisguy> i cant help but thing "ponies, the anthology 2" when i see this scene
<Kurra> is this like accessiblity recognition episode or something? :>
<twilight_sprinkle> bleh i have a terrible memory for these things
<Sumica> 00,10discord says fuck your mute button
<thisguy> "bam, bam bam bam. take that space. wanna go to earth. wanna go to earth"
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Because he's Discord
<DerpyMuffins> Discord should be the one to break the 4th wall, not Pinkie
<thisguy> she looks so cute with all the dirt all over her <3
<Sumica> 00,10discord breaks all walls
<CrimsonPhoenix> DIAMOND
<twilight_sprinkle> a big beautiful bedazzling BOULDER, the pioneers used to ride these babies
<thisguy> my fav pony <3 :)
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Hold on there, Jethro!
<DerpyMuffins> Fluttershy counter trolls
<twilight_sprinkle> ew fluttershy, go pls
<CrimsonPhoenix> also this video is one reason I cannot accept Dusk's Dawn as the first fan-ep
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: whos jethro anyway
<Mutterguy> supa dooper creepy music
<CrimsonPhoenix> and best discorded character coming right up
<Sumica> 00,10this video?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: *shrugs* :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> the BG music and sounds
<Sumica> 00,10ahhhhh
<thisguy> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> bam-evil
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dusk's Dawn lacked a lot of that
<Sumica> 00,10cause they put no work in to the foly
<AJIsAwesome> I always liked the music clip when they were discorded.
<twilight_sprinkle> ah dusks dawn
<CrimsonPhoenix> even the BG pictures themself
<twilight_sprinkle> thats quite the subject
<thisguy> dat tail whip
<Sumica> 00,10they admit they rushed it too
<Cades> yeah :/
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought dusks dawn wasnt too bad if you dont expect mlp quality of it
<Sumica> 00,10we watched it earlyer tonight
<Sumica> 00,10it was painful
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: It's wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good IMO.
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, I wouldn't mind the video...IF IT DIDN'T CLAIM FIRST FAN-EP EVER
<Sumica> 00,10you know that point when something is so bad you feel embared for the person doing it
<Yahooz> Ill give credit to Project Interlude for the attempt
<twilight_sprinkle> once you get passed the bad voice acting and detalization, its tolerable, the story seems pretty interesting
<thisguy> but it has ponies, so i'm okay with it
<DerpyMuffins> I kinda want to sleep on a cloud bed now
<Kurra> dusk's dawn? What is? o.o
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: isnt it though?
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's not
<AJIsAwesome> Yahooz: Agreed.
<thisguy> care package on the way
<CrimsonPhoenix> They rushed it to STEAL that title
<thisguy> i cannot believe i went there o.o
<CrimsonPhoenix> from Double Rainboom
<Sumica> 00,10Kurra, a fan made pony ep
<DerpyMuffins> RD broke da rulez
<Yahooz> CrimsonPhoenix: its the first full on fan made episode completed to my knowledge
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: ah i see. yeah they did seem to care a lot about their releaase date
<Kurra> Sumica, ooh, i wanna see *searches*
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the video was merely an internet flash video you would see on newgrounds
<Yahooz> Double Rainboom has nothing to do with Dusk' Dawn's storyline
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: the maze is gone now, idk
<Sumica> 00,10yeah problem is I would say it's not compleet
<J_E_Smith71> I actually recorded us watching, but I don't know if I should upload it. Fluttercry PMed me and told me it would make us look like jerks
<NocturnalBlade> suddenly end theme
<Yahooz> Sumica: eh, its /complete/
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I'm guessing he was able to destroy the maze.
<Yahooz> rather, released
<Sumica> 00,10we are jerks =p
<twilight_sprinkle> the nurses VA is hilariously unfitting
<thisguy> in a way, we all are
<thisguy> so were the mane 6 tonight, so we'll call it even :P
<Kimori> I'm back now
<CrimsonPhoenix> anyway I need to go to bed
<CrimsonPhoenix> Read Background Pony
<Spectrum_Rush> J_E_Smith71: do it
<twilight_sprinkle> bye CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> Good night

<J_E_Smith71> Sumi you don
<thisguy> night crimsonphoenix. dream of ponies tonight
<Kimori> it was okish..
<J_E_Smith71> Whoops
*Kurra expects an elevator music intermisson now and is unnerved when he doesn't hear one D:
<thelonepony> Night CrimsonPhoenix :)
<twilight_sprinkle> i gave it a like for effort, but yeah, it was rushed and loks like it was done just to claim the title of first fanmade ep which isnt cool
<Cades> oh haha
<J_E_Smith71> Sumi you don't have a problem if I put it up?
<CrimsonPhoenix> thisguy, I'll dream of Lyra and hug her to warm her from her curse
<CrimsonPhoenix> poor her.....
<J_E_Smith71> Granted its no sound but anyways
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
<NocturnalBlade> nite CrimsonPhoenix
<Sumica> 00,10I dont but I can ask if otheres do.
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=261112433429
<DerpyMuffins> Dusk Dawn wasnt that bad
<Kimori> want some 30 year old candy? :D
<XAX> twilight_sprinkle: Double rainboom?
<twilight_sprinkle> dusks dawn story was somewhat interesting
<Cades> hahaha sure :P
<AJIsAwesome> XAX: Dusk's Dawn.
<twilight_sprinkle> XAX: isnt that still in development?
<XAX> Oh.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: It is.
<twilight_sprinkle> okai
<Sumica> 00,10hold on.
<Midnight_Fyre> Well, off to bed for me soon. Later all
<AJIsAwesome> Yes, Sumica?
<twilight_sprinkle> hold on to what???
<thisguy> night, midnight. dream of ponies tonight :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Midnight_Fyre
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Midnight_Fyre. :)
<Sumica> 00,10this is double rainboom stuff
<Yahooz> dabi plssss
<NocturnalBlade> nite Midnight_Fyre
<XAX> Well I guess double rainboom lost the title of first fan made episode, but it will still have the highest quality fan episode title.
<thelonepony> Night Midn- damn it :(
<thisguy> yay :)
<Sylandest> ...wow
<Sylandest> This is...amazing
<DerpyMuffins> Now this is how it should be done
<Sumica> 00,10exactly
<XAX> Sumica: The audition clips for double rainboom are so good and cute and stuff ._.
<J_E_Smith71> Even shorter animations like Childern of The Night do it right
<AJIsAwesome> I honestly couldn't care about the "first" title, as long as it's done very well.
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=130761801296
<twilight_sprinkle> the animation is good yes, but who knows how the rest will be
<Kurra> I still love that :>
<thisguy> i love good and cute and stuff :)
<thisguy> defines the ponies
<Kurra> ^
<Kurra> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Sumica> 00,10cause thes guys are taking time to get people on the team to do it right
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230865673698
<DerpyMuffins> Wait, isnt it already fall?
<Kimori> You know what I'm going to bid on that air freshener
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Yes.
<NocturnalBlade> oh yes :)
<Kurra> it is.
<twilight_sprinkle> animation alone wont suffice though
<twilight_sprinkle> they shouldve joined forces
<Cades> haha nice
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: don't forget the head guy will have a job at dhx too
<twilight_sprinkle> thats always the way to g
<twilight_sprinkle> *go
<Kurra> O////o;;....
<thisguy> ouch
<Kurra> Insect intake/
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: only if theres comparative advantage in both parties though
<Yahooz> economically speaking
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: well dusks dawn seems to have a good story, these guys have good animation, together i think they couldve done good
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Spectrum_Rush
<DerpyMuffins> They really cant claim first fan-made episode anymore
<Queen_Chrysalis> derpy :D~!!!
<AJIsAwesome> But they don't NEED to, IMO.
<Sumica> 00,10I love that derpy one
<twilight_sprinkle> they should get the guy who did picture perfect pony, that dude was MLG
<otakon> hiya guys
<AJIsAwesome> Is it REALLY necessary to have that title?
<otakon> well I had a huge scare
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon! *hugs8
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, otakon. :)
<thelonepony> Hi otakon :)
<AJIsAwesome> Dat Lyra
<thisguy> hi otakon
<superretroworld> uhh otakon i have some bad news
<otakon> My pc wouldn't load up my desktop when I logged in at first
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: true, it shouldnt be a big deal
<otakon> superretroworld: what?
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: you mean brony dance party?
<NocturnalBlade> hi otakon
<J_E_Smith71> Even when you're first to do something there's always someone who can do it better later
<superretroworld> otakon: communitys getting delayed
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: try hitting it, that fixes my laptop
<otakon> superretroworld: damn
<otakon> yeah well I managed to get it running by logging into my guest account
<AJIsAwesome> Dat Charmy
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: thats his/her name?
<superretroworld> ik, just found out today :(
<thelonepony> :D
<Sumica> 00,10his early work
<DerpyMuffins> The bees
<thelonepony> I love this one <3
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: i believe so, and no, they shouldn't join forces... brony dance party doesnt give them any extra animation benefits...
<Sylandest> aw-awwwww
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh god this <3
<twilight_sprinkle> this is his early work? hot damn
<thisguy> dat pinkie <3 :)
<thelonepony> aaaawwwwwww <3
<DerpyMuffins> They still need staff members btw
<Yahooz> They have the same style: pony creator vectors :p
<thisguy> dat squeaking
<thelonepony> Gummy :3
<Maid_RainBow> aaahh
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: gives extra very-talented work force though
<Maid_RainBow> DAT gummy
<NocturnalBlade> lol gummy troll
<RaveBrony> Bed timeee good night everyone! :)
<Sumica> 00,10ok back to the ep
<twilight_sprinkle> bye RaveBrony
<ASoftFluffyThing> Goddamit my heart!
<AJIsAwesome> Night, RaveBrony. :)
<thelonepony> Night RaveBrony :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night RaveBrony
<NocturnalBlade> nite RaveBrony
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: all it does is increase human capital, but if you ask me, i don't believe that it would make a difference
<thisguy> night ravebrony. dream of ponies tonight :)
<thisguy> now back to the show
<NocturnalBlade> so much cuteness from Pinkie in that vid <3
<Yahooz> especially when they gain one animator with a very simular style
<Yahooz> yes efficiency increases, but quality?
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: idk, im not sure how they divide work in animation, but id think an extra talented person in a fan production could help
<AJIsAwesome> KICK!
<J_E_Smith71> Discord's line is true. "This fandom is the most fun I've had in eons!"
<thisguy> where's a drill instructor when you need one
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: itd speed it up the process
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: but in terms of quality, yeah, it probably wouldnt help much
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: exactly
<twilight_sprinkle> still, hes a smidge bit better than their animation
<twilight_sprinkle> picture perfect is the best animation out there
<Yahooz> mmmmmm
<NocturnalBlade> i hate chocolate milk too pinkie >_>
<Sumica> 00,10well twilight_sprinkle, seeing as it was mostly reused bits from the show I should hope so
<twilight_sprinkle> i liek chocolate milk :3
<thisguy> or what's left of ponyville
<thisguy> me too :)
<sub06905> :3 http://imgur.com/jvue2
<twilight_sprinkle> dat cheese
<otakon> dem slender bunnies
<thelonepony> STAMPEDE!!!
<Cheese> twilight_sprinkle: I liek cereal. :3
<twilight_sprinkle> :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: you mean the picture perfect pony video?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Sumica> 00,10most of it was puled edited and croped bits from the show
<Yahooz> Im not much a brony dance party fan. tbh he just uses premade vectors and pony-creator skins and puts it all into a flash. There are so many more talented animators that deserve the attention he gets :p
<Sumica> 00,10only the OC's and bits with ponies geting the looked changed were new
<DerpyMuffins> Wouldnt two sonic rainbooms be impossible?
<Yahooz> Sumica: hence pony creator :p
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, didnt know he reused stuff though
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<J_E_Smith71> DerpyMuffins: If two pegasi were doing them at once then no
<DerpyMuffins> Yes 2 ponies
<J_E_Smith71> Speaking of Tom, he needs his own trading card: http://i1086.photobucket.com/albums/j455/TheDescendantofKehAn/TomCard_zps5c9a7f66.png
<thisguy> is it me, or do the look a bit cuter when they're all gray? no? just me? o.o
<Sumica> 00,10the bit with photofinish out of her useal out fit was actaly trixie
<twilight_sprinkle> oh that reminds me, i still need to make that black red alicorn oc in pony maker with fangs and bat wings
<thelonepony> Tom Is best rock :3
<AJIsAwesome> Tom needs his own MOVIE.
<DerpyMuffins> But how many ponies do we know can do a sonic rainboom?
<AJIsAwesome> Either that or his own episode.
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: its pretty obvious, in fact, pony creator allows you to custom move the ponys position... in theory he could get away with using pony creator and flash
<sub06905> RD= Sonic Rainboom, FS= Sonic Shyboom :3
<twilight_sprinkle> still, although it doesnt take as much talent, it sure was an effect method. perhaps they should use it more often
<thelonepony> sub06905: I would love to see a FS :3
<J_E_Smith71> sub06905: And of course Sonic Pinkboom
<twilight_sprinkle> *effective
<DerpyMuffins> With with all the sonic?
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: true, and as long as he gets out content that goes with quality original content, people are happy
<J_E_Smith71> (Chaos, confusion, evil, meow()
<Yahooz> hence [PMV]s
<otakon> brb guys
<sub06905> thelonepony: http://ponyderivative.com/images/single/fluttershy/fluttershy-sonic-rainboom-2.jpg
<otakon> restoring my system from a day ago
<DerpyMuffins> Those have to be my favorite lines from Twilight
<J_E_Smith71> And Twilight doesn't realize they wouldn't work yet
<otakon> ever since I ran HP Support Assistant my PC hasn't been acting right
<thelonepony> sub06905: Yay!! \:3/
<thisguy> <3 yay fluttershy
<Sumica> 00,10ewwwwww HP
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: im not really a fan of PMVs, most of them dont seem to fit to the music for me. but in this case he actually made something new using those vectors, me thinks that should be used more often
<StupidSexyCJ> ponies? what is this madness?
<sub06905> spike is best rainbow dash
<J_E_Smith71> Again Twilight you think this was going to work without RD ?
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: there is only a total of one classic PMV in existence that i actually enjoy
<xMLPxREACTORx> hello there everypony
<NocturnalBlade> heeeeres tommy!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, xMLPxREACTORx. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: which one?
<thisguy> i dont think she cares if it works at this point
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai xMLPxREACTORx
<thelonepony> Hi xMLPxREACTORx :)
<NocturnalBlade> hi xMLPxREACTORx
<Yahooz> This is War
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hiya xMLPxREACTORx

<DerpyMuffins> Dem shades
<Barbetos> PONIES!
<Barbetos> on bronystate!?
<Barbetos> WHAT!?
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: is it the one i want to roast on a stick?
<Barbetos> Christmas has come early.
<sub06905> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> arrow blocker
<thisguy> ^^^
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Barbetos> Dem white folks over at bronystate are so nice, they treat us so good.
<Yahooz> twilight_sprinkle: its by BronyVids
<DerpyMuffins> Im surprised Twilight has such control over the elements since she has only used it once before
<Barbetos> But! I has to sleep.
<Barbetos> Night guys!
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<sub06905> night Barbetos
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Barbetos. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Barbetos
<Spectrum_Rush> why are ya'll surprised theres ponies Sumica streams them all the time
<thelonepony> Night Barbetos :)
<thisguy> sumica is best pony
<thisguy> night barbetos. dream of ponies tonight :)
<Barbetos> I sad I has to leave on a sumi stream. =(
<StupidSexyCJ> whoever edited this did a pretty decent job quieting the vocals and BG noises
<Barbetos> Oh well.
<AJIsAwesome> Dat timing. :D
<Barbetos> Catch ya later.
<thisguy> screwball
<xMLPxREACTORx> Will I'm going to be geting off in a little but I just had a question what is this thing with Luna called children of shadows?
<twilight_sprinkle> Yahooz: idk which video youre talking about
<Yahooz> ill pm you
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone notice that Derpy is the only one not affect by this?
<Sumica> 00,10StupidSexyCJ, they used the 5.1 audio eps
<thisguy> well, i dont see derpy anywhere here, so i cant really know myself
<Sumica> 00,10and just turned off the front channnles
<Spectrum_Rush> DerpyMuffins: does not appear during these scenes
<AJIsAwesome> I actually had a mini theory once that Screwball was Screwloose discorded, but seeing how they have differnt cutie marks it wouldn't work.
<StupidSexyCJ> Sumica: ah
<twilight_sprinkle> xMLPxREACTORx: wow im surprised you havent seen it, its been streamed here several hundred times. its a pmv thats almost finished
<Sumica> 00,10hence the echos
<Sumica> 00,10and being able to hear any off camera voices
<Cades> looks like theres someone else looking on a really dead spyro forum that I found
<thisguy> it was scary when there was a conversation back at canterlot o.o
<AJIsAwesome> It would be interesting to see how Screwloose became who she is.
<twilight_sprinkle> xMLPxREACTORx: i think its about some fanfic
<thisguy> all the echos and such. i almost thought that place was haunted
<xMLPxREACTORx> o well thanks for the info guys
<AJIsAwesome> xMLPxREACTORx: I think it explains it in the video description.
<AJIsAwesome> It supposedly takes place after the first defeat of Discord I think.
<DerpyMuffins> I still think Twilight could defeat Discord on her own if she channeled the power of her Element
<thisguy> pigs flying. now i've seen everything
<owloysius> man, it's shizuka here
<Tovler> o.o I almost brought a tabby cat inside
<J_E_Smith71> Making a feeble old women dance like that, Discord you bastard
<twilight_sprinkle> spiderman wants your friendchips
<thisguy> i'd like a pet cat :3
<StupidSexyCJ> thisguy: get a dog instead
<DerpyMuffins> Funny how the Princess always knows what to do
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: i dont get that meme
<DerpyMuffins> Almost like she knew what Discord was going to do
<twilight_sprinkle> itd be nice if the princess actually did something herself instead of manipulating the mane 6
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: its just a pretty random video on youtube
<superretroworld> oh
<Tovler> If only that tabby cat acted germane.
<owloysius> wait, that's derpy
<DerpyMuffins> I'd like to see the Princesses do something for once instead of being in the Castle all day
<thisguy> it has 60's spiderman :P
<Tovler> and saintly
<sonicandmario85> i can still hear them a tiny bit XD
<Sumica> 00,10some like to think that luna sent all the letters back to twi
<owloysius> :P
<twilight_sprinkle> 60s spiderman is brilliant
<Yahooz> <3 Give me all your friendchips
<Kimori> looking for what?
<Yahooz> Bittybittybittybitty
<Sumica> 00,10cause she was studying them to be able to learn about friendship
<DerpyMuffins> Sumica: why Luna?
<J_E_Smith71> Ambient bird noises
<twilight_sprinkle> biddidy biddidy biddidy
<StupidSexyCJ> best part
<Yahooz> heh
<thisguy> <3 hnnnngh
<thelonepony> <3
<owloysius> do you mind if i kidnap you?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I understand what you mean, but I have a head theory that because she's been busy maintaining stability in Equestria (to the best of abilities, of course), she hasn't used her magic a lot in ages.
<NocturnalBlade> daaaaaaaw
<Shizuka> 13nimbus away!
<NocturnalBlade> meep meep
<AJIsAwesome> *mini head theory
<owloysius> but she only has 2.3 wingpower
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: twilight should be supreme overlord of ponyland!
<Cades> You know how on most forums it'll tell you if there are any members or guests that are looking at the same topic as you?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Agreed. :D
<thelonepony> Fluttershy of course you can kidnap me <3
<sonicandmario85> PINKIE!
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: that looks more lika a cumulus :S
<DerpyMuffins> Fluttershy cant fly that fast
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, Pinkie. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> stay away from me fluttershy, i dont like you.
<StupidSexyCJ> Shizuka: Power-rope extend!
<Maid_RainBow> THAT BIG DUMB MEANIE!!!!
<thisguy> <3 :)
<otakon> FLUTTERRAGE GO!
<owloysius> wow, the instrumentals are good
<Maid_RainBow> Fluttershy speed : Mach 1
<otakon> How'd she tie ropes around her hooves?
<twilight_sprinkle> this instruamental was probably done in a program though
<weeping_pegasi82> magic
<owloysius> with a lasso?
<twilight_sprinkle> it sounds like it
<owloysius> :D
<DerpyMuffins> I really call BS on this, no way Fluttershy can match RD's speed
<thelonepony> :d
<twilight_sprinkle> RD wasnt flying though, she was using her cloud thing
<thisguy> well, she was slowed down by pinkie and rarity
<owloysius> chaos comes with pie?
<Spectrum_Rush> MY LEG!!!

<Kimori> sorry for the idle, browsing ebay
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: need link?
<Sumica> 00,10you can link to my HD
<kirzstryfe> running something through youtube at the same time as streaming kills the quality
<Cades> np haha
<Sumica> 00,10and the file name is complex as fuck due to the ripper copying the video title from youtube
<Sumica> 00,10✭ρ♏V ✭ ~ ♪♬ ~ в ℓ σ ω ~ ♪♬ __ ∂αяк нσσƒ ѕтυ∂ισѕ ❤ _

<Sumica> 00,10good thing I saved it and reuploaded it though
<thisguy> lol
<NocturnalBlade> yeeeeeees!
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: how does that work?
<Kurra> every
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - youtube has a system called "Content ID"
<Kimori> Ive been getting an interest in pinball machines now :P
<Sumica> 00,10could even just be the user did't like ponies any more
<MirrorImage> where basically a copyright holder uploads the video once
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: ah ok i see
<MirrorImage> and if someone else uploads a video that contains bits from that video, it gets tagged and removed
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: couldnt you just rename the file so its not coded so weird, or does it not work that way
<Spectrum_Rush> ?
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah that system is why i cant upload gundam style to youtube
<Sumica> 00,10I could Spectrum_Rush
<Cades> You gonna start hoarding pinball machines now haha
<twilight_sprinkle> okay thx for expaining MirrorImage
<Sumica> 00,10but i dont normaly look for it
<Kimori> I dunno
<Kimori> if they are fun
<sonicandmario85> Sumica: gangdam style*
<MirrorImage> and for that particular video, it pulls from so many songs it's basically like shooting buckshot at the system
<Kimori> I just love the 80s tabletop ones
<Sumica> 00,10If I ever fix my video anounce scrip i would rename it
<MirrorImage> you'll hit *something*
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41nuTHgxPn4&feature=related
<Kimori> after watching it you just wanna play it :D
<twilight_sprinkle> bleh, id like this song, but why does have to be about sex...

<otakon> you had to have done something
<MirrorImage> Sumica - can Windows Movie Maker read mkv?

<AJIsAwesome> My dog's incredibly hyper. She won't even lick you, she'll just bite you for fun. :D
<Eddmario> The weird thing is, dogs normally love me
<twilight_sprinkle> Silver_Soother: heh yeah mine gets like that too, but my cat is actually really really nice
<twilight_sprinkle> Silver_Soother: it even plays fetch with me :D
<Silver_Soother> AJIsAwesome: Lol; mine does the same. She'll come up and just put your hand in her mouth. xD
<AJIsAwesome> It's a friendly bite, of course. :D
<Eddmario> Seriously, we know some people who's dog will bark or growl at anybody that gets close to it, but it actually let's me pet it
<thelonepony> My Parrot always "barks" like a dog when People Come over :D
<Silver_Soother> twilight_sprinkle: If I threw something for my cat to fetch, it would grab it, and look at me like I am crazy.

<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I can understand that.
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Thanks> :)
<twilight_sprinkle> i get all sorts of murderous desires when a bird wont shut the f*ck up at 4 am
<Sumica> 00,10used to have a mocking bird that liked to start up in the trees at like 2 am
<Eddmario> So, who else has the Samsung Galaxy S III as their phone?
<Sumica> 00,10introduced it to a presureised watere sprayer
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: oh i need to try that
<Silver_Soother> twilight_sprinkle: My bird never tweeted at night, just during the day. It would NEVER stop chirping. Then the other bird would just chirpping... Oh god, the noises...
<Petrified_Discord> Sumica: You are my hero.
<twilight_sprinkle> i was just thinking of wacking the tree it was in with a bat
<MirrorImage> and you thought your cats hated when you hit them with the spray bottle...
<twilight_sprinkle> dont have a bat though..
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They haven't said how much yet. They probably will release the info once the game comes out so they know the total amount of preorders.
<Sumica> 00,10i punted taht bird out of the tree and sent it at least a block through the air
<Eddmario> So, who here has had those Starbucks Vita things you can buy in the coffee aisle at Wal-Mart?

<Kandarihu> The neighbors on both sides of my house on the same side of my street both have dogs. To the left of my house are two dogs who are ultra-territorial. They bark at me like crazy (especially the pit-bull) and refuse to back down unless their master TELLS them to back down.

<NocturnalBlade> sexy dungeon
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: totally, and jarjar is best character evah
<shiningdawn> what is this i love it
<Eddmario> I <3 dogs. They're the best pets. Cats on the other hand suck, and I'm not just saying that because I'm allergic to cats...
<Sumica> 00,10the real question is how many went and looked for that just now killerpony7733 =p
<twilight_sprinkle> dogs are dangerous and loud, i dont like them
<Petrified_Discord> shiningdawn: This is the future
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't :D
<killerpony7733> Sumica 1-3-5 people?
<shiningdawn> some one plz tell me plz
<Cades> gonna idle for a bit
<twilight_sprinkle> a dog can kill you if it decides to, a cat cant
<Kandarihu> The neighbor to the right of my house has this little dog who is sweet as can be. He only barks at the squirrels in the trees. He's been neglected most of the time because his master is a workaholic.
<p4ngya> shiningdawn: how do you not know???
<AJIsAwesome> I like dogs over cats, but I'd love to have a cat.
<Eddmario> Admit it, you can't watch/hear this WITHOUT dancing...
<Petrified_Discord> Fukkiereta? Okay then :)
<Sumica> 00,10this is called "1000 people clicked the subscribe button by accident"

<Kimori> k
<AJIsAwesome> DAT EAGLE HYBRID
<twilight_sprinkle> my neighbors had a dog, that thing would bark loud as hell henever someone walked by...
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> "PMV - Appleloosan Psychiatrist" is still good too
<NocturnalBlade> ASoftFluffyThing: downloaded lol
<shiningdawn> sad face
<Sumica> 00,10indeed it is good
<Eddmario> DeadpoolDash|GW2: I don't think any PMV for a terrible song can be considered "good"
<thelonepony> whats wrong shiningdawn :(
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, a cat can hurt you pretty bad if you handle one wrong. They never hurt humans on purpose. But accidents can happen if they're scrambling.
<Sumica> 00,10some day I should just set my player to play folder from my pony videos and leave it running all day
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> that is a great song
<Petrified_Discord> This used to be ponies. Where did they gooooooooo?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: accidents can happen with naything though
<Sumica> 00,10shiningdawn i just gave you the name

<Kurra> so.... where is Granny Smith in this??
<Tovler> I guess those are bug wings.
<otakon> p4ngya: it's the simple deformed style they're animated in i.e. huge heads, tiny bodies and huge dispropotioned legs

<Tovler> ;-; I just don't know
<otakon> damn he went too fast that time
<otakon> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> they probably dont need to test it that precisely though, knowing the programmed speed
<twilight_sprinkle> test it that much i mean*
<therainbowvortex> yes i got 65 points thistime
<otakon> that was bullshit NewSuperBronyU you went THROUGH that platform
<Kandarihu> Problem is, you can reload from saves in a game but not life.
<Tovler> How does this compare to the bonecoster from NSMBW?
<twilight_sprinkle> wooo
<twilight_sprinkle> that didnt last long lol
<otakon> Tovler: around the same
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: saw one perfect run on YT
<thelonepony> You Can Do It!!!!!!!!!
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Tovler> I'm not entirely sure. Your knowledge of this stage shall be great.
<Tovler> Just keep swimming
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: don't helicopter and just run jump
<otakon> dammit
<otakon> too short
<otakon> wat?
<therainbowvortex> i wiss i could play this
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: That grandma will ALWAYS hit you if you try to attack her.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: oh
<AJIsAwesome> Never jump on the green ones.
<Tovler> I eat green grannies
<AJIsAwesome> Attack from the sides.
<Tovler> granny smith apples that is
<twilight_sprinkle> i just saw a video of a guy who did a perfect run of the entire 5th chapter of super meat boy
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Nice!
<otakon> that's ridiculous
<otakon> lol
<otakon> You turn into a little old cranky lady
<otakon> DAMMIT
<twilight_sprinkle> all dem tentacles
<otakon> I couldn't do this game
<otakon> I get frustrated WAY too easily with platformers like this
<twilight_sprinkle> i wouldve broken my controller after the first few levels
<otakon> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> i HATE redoing the same level over and over
<twilight_sprinkle> it infuriates me
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: dead center of the pirahna plants I think
<Tovler> This looks about the same as the gold levels in DKCR
<AJIsAwesome> Too bad there aren't any Lums in this stage.
<otakon> too bad you can't take a goddamn hit
<otakon> I hate 0 health systems
<AJIsAwesome> Well you can, if you carry a heart over from a previous stage.
<AJIsAwesome> THat's what I do sometimes.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: yeah good luck with THAT in THIS stage
<AJIsAwesome> I know. :D
<thelonepony> otakon: have you ever played Prinny Before?
<thelonepony> In Hard Mode
<otakon> thelonepony: no but I've heard of it's hellish difficulty
<AJIsAwesome> "Hitting on Rayman" :D
<otakon> DAMMMMMMMMMMMMIT
<thelonepony> :D
*Tovler thinks on hitting on Rain Man
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Hit the green one, bounce off of it, and the helicopter to the platforms..
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: try STOp running and WAIT for her to lift up a bit
<otakon> dammit
<Tovler> I thought the point of this game was to spite Mario
<otakon> Yeah I would have been cussing like a sailor by now at the very top of my lungs in anger
<AJIsAwesome> If you think this stage is hard now
<Tovler> I read that as Sailor Moon >,<
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> Try 4 player CO-OP.
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<AJIsAwesome> I can.
<otakon> no NOT Sailor Scout
<NocturnalBlade> we can here the music NewSuperBronyU
<otakon> just plain Sailor
<J_E_Smith71> Music is coming in clear
<otakon> lol
<Tovler> I love that beyonce song
<otakon> I was gonna do that
<otakon> what?
<Tovler> no worse than you, me, and Dupree
<otakon> I have heard great things about Ted
<AJIsAwesome> It was good?
<otakon> is it out on DVD yet?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I can hear it NewSuperBronyU
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: I heard it was hilarious
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<Tovler> Did you see Ted before or after Flash Gordon?
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't see the appeal in the commercial, so I thought it would tank.
<otakon> FINALLY!
<otakon> lava?
<AJIsAwesome> Yay! :)
<Tovler> bum bum bumbum bum bum
<otakon> WAHT?!
<AJIsAwesome> Yep

<Tovler> thinking positive thoughts about Seth MacFarlane helps too
<thelonepony> Serpent Like Lava D:
<otakon> FUCK
<AJIsAwesome> Just wait until the secret in this stage. :D
<otakon> goddammit what masochists DESIGN this shit?
<twilight_sprinkle> dat amerispanish :D
<Moopy> k im back i had to go check on my cat
<otakon> need a drink
<otakon> brb
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: probably the old platformers tactic, make a game hard to make it feel long
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Can you wait in the room at the final part of the stage? I want to hear that music again. :D
<Tovler> I'm always surprised at how I can beat these kind of games after 10 minutes
<twilight_sprinkle> oh god NewSuperBronyU , how do you manage to multitask so well :D
<twilight_sprinkle> i could never talk and play this game
<twilight_sprinkle> lul

<Silver_Soother|Drwho> Newbrony streaming, AND on mic, turning off Dr. Who to watch. :3
<twilight_sprinkle> SB is OP, nerfpls
<AJIsAwesome> Now, even though I like how the Wii version managed to pull this off very well, I prefer the ps3/360. Mainly because you actually GET rewards for doing this kind of stuff.
<AJIsAwesome> Hope Wii U has an achievements system.
<Tovler> Writing down wisecracks/riffs for notes helps me remember stuff
<AJIsAwesome> Also, welcome back Silver_Soother|Drwho. :)

<Silver_Soother> twilight_sprinkle: In reality, this is some poor grandmother just doing her nails...

<Silver_Soother> DoctoDoctorWho: Morrowwind, I could play that again.
*Vordox sees this video and cries....
<Vordox> WHYYY
<Vordox> FLASh
<Vordox> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Silver_Soother> Vordox: There are a few reasons you are acting this way...
<Panda> Vordox, beycase you.. i dunno
<taoumi> the sweetie belle version
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: Yeah, cause I had a fully functional code, I MADE a Rhythm is Magic game..
<Vordox> But then the specifics comes, and the game was scrapped due to Flash's Sound API
<Silver_Soother> :( I have no idea how bad that must feel. But it must've been a waste of a LOT of time.
<Vordox> 8 months
<Vordox> I'm trying to find alternative but...
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<Silver_Soother> Ouch...
<Silver_Soother> Rainbow Feedback: Pretty awesome, but could be about 20% cooler.
*Panda slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Sumica> 00,10Some day i will convence super to stop pulling signal directly from capture cared to fmle
<Jmo> Oi
<Jmo> Go to bed you drunk
<Panda> Sumica, lets hopp its coon no?
<Panda> Jmo, who da faw you talkinn ito?
<Jmo> You.
<Panda> no
<Panda> You be talkn to yo self jaynoo
<Silver_Soother> Hmmm, looks interesting; easy to pick up, but hard to master kind of game.
<Jmo> Nope
<Jmo> You're the only drunk here.
*Panda is not dunk .___.
<Silver_Soother> Jmo: Does sleep despravity count?
<Jmo> Nop
<Silver_Soother> Okay, then, you're right.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Silver_Soother: what theme did they combind with morrowind to make skyrims theme?
<Panda> Jmo waiting for the GF t oget home... so cant seleep
<Panda> ...
<Jmo> Meh
<Panda> gosh my spellin so attrocioud
<Silver_Soother> DoctoDoctorWho: It's pretty much a reprisal of the Morrowwind theme. It's the Elder Scrolls them more then just Morrow-Wind.
<taoumi> the wrestels level
<taoumi> awww
<Silver_Soother> What is your favorite mini-game on here NewSuperBronyU ?
<Panda> meeds more old spice
<Vordox> I SEE NO META GAMING NewSuperBronyU !

<DoctoDoctorWho> You all know what time it is...

<Silver_Soother> Ruba duba duba duba that true?
<Vordox> WHAT A MAN
<Panda> XD SB what you dojng/
<DoctoDoctorWho> SONG TIME!
<Vordox> Panda: Being a MAN!
<Silver_Soother> Panda: Giving the fans what that asked.

<Panda> SB, inb4 thats waht yo look likes irl?
<Panda> XD
<Panda> wait!
<Panda> sb, do the remics 10
<Silver_Soother> So, this is where that AppleJack thing comes from.
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: and many more
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I hate when firefox decides to not respond to my clicks
<AdamTheDuck> I keep hearing "Jack" instead of jab because of the AJ version :D
<Silver_Soother> Vordox: I guess having prior knowledge of this game would help understand those then. Lol.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Nord) What happened to you gamers? It seems somewhere along the way, you turned from doing good and so now evil's holding sway. Rythim games and fitness games and even cooking sims! Gamer) What else are we to do?! Nord Fight the fight in ol' Skyrim!
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: I got more then prior knowledge. XD I tried to copy the code itself.
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: SEE SAW! aaaw
<Silver_Soother> Vordox: xD Yeah, you got REAL close to it. :P
<Silver_Soother> Is it weird, that when I see these, I got a nostalgia for the MLP version, and not the other way around?
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: You got a wii?
<taoumi> this one was also redone w/ a terraria theme as well
<Silver_Soother> Vordox: I have one in the house, not mine though.
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: Older sibling or younger?
<Silver_Soother> Currently younger, though they have NO games for it. Lol, it's kind of just sitting there at the moment.
<Panda> Icant lok a t this game and not hink ponies
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: Get...THIS GAME! I got my Wii JUST for this game alone
<Silver_Soother> Vordox: That's a pretty big recommendation.
<Tovler> Wii is now 130$
<naturesfury> what a time to log in i gess
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: Where do you live?
<NocturnalBlade> hi naturesfury
<Silver_Soother> Vordox: Illinois, why you ask?
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: The game has 3 official names
<Vordox> YES
<Vordox> SEE SAW
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: Honestly it looks rather silly, but thats just my opinion
<Vordox> my favourite RIM <3
<Panda> C SAW
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Looks silly? So shallow...
<taoumi> does this game have the multi player or was that only the japanese version NewSuperBronyU ?
<Tovler> jawohl
<Panda> its AJ and RD!
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: The Japanese name is Rhythm Heaven Fever, in Jap it's Minna no Sengoku something.. And the EU version has a name I forgot(Beat system something)
<Silver_Soother> I think the only other rhythm game I played besides guitar hero / rock band, was Elite Beat Agents on DS.
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: 3 totally differente gaames :P
<Silver_Soother> I know right? xD
*Tovler clicks. "ohai, swastika"
<Vordox> Still say this is the best one in years(Beat Agents is second)
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: Cheer Reeaaaders! 2 or 1! Or Remix 9!
<Silver_Soother> I can see why I need to get this. Honestly; I can.
<Panda> SB, ITS ALL UP TO YOU!
<Silver_Soother> I am getting into the music, and I have never played teh game before. :)

<Moopy> twilight_sprinkle: hey look..........books in the background
<Vordox> It's NOT EASY
<Panda> Silver_Soother XD danke
<Panda> hm... so this is twiligthts theme song?

<Vordox> GAH
<Vordox> MONKEY WATCH
<twilight_sprinkle> or rather rhythm would be a better term
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle i love you
<Silver_Soother> So, this is a remix of ALL the mini-games into one game? That's a lot of memorization to get through.
<Vordox> Silver_Soother: YOu have NO idea how long NewSuperBronyU tried to beat this
<twilight_sprinkle> i love you too Panda , but you really should get some sleep :S

<Silver_Soother> How long are they going to keep making Wii games after Wii U is released?
<Tovler> free HDMI?
<Silver_Soother> Tovler: Yes, free HDMI; worth the price right there. Easily.
<taoumi> oh pishaw
<Tovler> for shame
<taoumi> ps3 is still the most powerfull non PC console out there
<naturesfury> backwards comp!
<Silver_Soother> Calling Sony cheap, at least they give free games to PS Plus members, Xbox is cheap compared.
<taoumi> yes just not to ps2 :3 naturesfury
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: Marketing. :P
<taoumi> well nintento has never won any battles in power. and they knwo this
<naturesfury> hmmm
<taoumi> that's wh ythey don't try to
<Tovler> That's less than 300!
<Silver_Soother> There are enough tech specs out there, give me a reason to go out and buy the system by showing me the games, while playing dubstep or something hip.
<naturesfury> pikmin?
<Silver_Soother> Pikmin 3; MY reason to get Wii U.
<naturesfury> same
<Jmo> Pikmin4lyf

<Tovler> Animal Crossing Wii U will happen eventually.
<Vordox> Nintendo Land alpha!
<Tovler> someone buy NewSuperBronyU Pikmin 2.
<taoumi> nintendo is going the same route that xbox took in the last generation. that is why xbox has won this generation and ps2 won the last
<taoumi> the games
<Silver_Soother> I still roll with my Gamecube. I may just play Pikmin 1 and 2 again soon. :3
<Tovler> at least Ubisoft picked up the slack.

<Vivix> On fridays there's simpsons marathon on Viasat 4 in Norway, for like..4-5 hours
<Vivix> I htink
<Vivix> I think I'll turn on the TV, see if anything fun is on-
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, that's a jab at my self esteem
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Till october 20th

<Vivix> Ah man, whenever I watch simpsons now, I hear the commentaries in my head
<the_real_pony_1604> hahahah
<Vivix> Oh the parodies
<alexxm> sorry i had to go had to help with some faml
<alexxm> sorry i had to go had to help with some family stuff
<Spectrum_Rush> ...
<Vivix> Oh nature
<alexxm> ah the wonders of nature
<Moopy> dat scootaloo
<Spectrum_Rush> now what era could you bye all that with a nickel
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Spectrum_Rush: that's the joke. Every time they make him older and older
<Vivix> Yeah, it's great
<Vivix> Like the-- wood pressing of him scaring children
<alexxm> seems legit
<Spectrum_Rush> ValtheJean: last time I watched the simpsons Burns was like 99 or something
<alexxm> didn't one episode say he was over 100
<Vivix> Did they ever state it?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's one of the things they will never be consistant about
<Vivix> I think in one episode they said his age was his pin number
<Spectrum_Rush> indeed val
<Vivix> Oh moe
<the_real_pony_1604> I had that as a text message tone for a bit
<Vivix> I think MLP and Simpsons are two favourite animated series-
<Vivix> composition and timing- even if sometimes Simpsons is a bit heavy info and timing issues on certain jokes-
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> what is funny is that Burns is right on all counts
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah
<Vivix> Homer's lessons are the best. Trying is the first step to failure
<alexxm> lenny had a reign of terror?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> take the money
<alexxm> and lisa prooves shes a dumbass
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> I'd take the money- try to make up for it
<Spectrum_Rush> alexxm: with great power comes great resposibilty, with absolute power comes absolute corruption
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> 12 million
<Vivix> AH man, Shoulda turned the stream on earlier. Made my morning
<DoctoDoctorWho> Spectrum_Rush: depends on the corruptee, some might not accept
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh ponies
<AdamTheDuck> Pony insanity.
<AdamTheDuck> This was stuck in my head during last year's exams.

<Phase4> wow

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Phase4

<Phase4> ooo simpsons
<Phase4> Vivix, yeah

<Vivix> PedoMoustache
<Vivix> noo- never thouht about it
<Phase4> it runs several hundred regex for some reason
<Vivix> o.O
<Phase4> yeah, i dont get it either
<Vivix> You could probably simplify it tons without getting more inaccurate-
<alexxm> oh ralph
<Moopy> Well everypony got to hit to bed see yall in the morning ok aight peace
<Phase4> Vivix, theres actually built in operations to do 99% of the work
<alexxm> and thus futurama was born
<Vivix> I'm not too familiar with timing, yet, but setInterval does the counting- but- I can't imagine it needing much more than that, and data
<Vivix> Lawyers<3
<the_real_pony_1604> real show writers
<Vivix> Yeah,
<Vivix> David X Cohen is the guy with the squid, right?
<Vivix> no wait, he's later-

<alexxm> instant scrappy
<Spectrum_Rush> lampshade hanging
<Vivix> Ah troy
<alexxm> shame phill hartman died
<Vivix> yeah-
<Vivix> damn cocaine wife
<Spectrum_Rush> uh murdered
<Vivix> his wife shot him while high, I think
<Vivix> or stabbed him-
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dammit Homer
<Spectrum_Rush> latter
<Vivix> Apparently she was clean, but some dirtbag hollywood dude got her back into it
<alexxm> i know the wife did it but not how
<Vivix> AH I love the animation episodes
<Vivix> so many injokes and--background people
<ValtheJean> 2,14 bronies, learn from this scene
<Vivix> This is us 15 years from now
<Vivix> or--actually, already happened
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> ...she is just a VA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 treat our VAs well, please don't harass them
<Vivix> Homer..that hurt
<alexxm> burn
<alexxm> why would VAs know about how to beat the videogame
<Vivix> hehe, oh comic book guy
<Vivix> yeah, va's get asked craazy questions by nerds
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat cosplayer
<Vivix> just look at panels with The big bang theory
<CrimsonPhoenix> I guess Bronies are actually light in compare
<DoctoDoctorWho> 2012, Season 3 of mlp!
<Vivix> Yeah, but- once we age as a fandom, we'll get trekkie grade nerds, I'm sure
<ValtheJean> 2,14 vivix: >implying we already haven't
<Vivix> <,<
*Vivix is a lore nerd deluxe
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> D=
*alexxm kidnaps Jmo
<Jmo> Oi
<alexxm> what
<Vivix> Midge
<Jmo> What did Chrysalis say
*MecidTheGermanBrony slits Jmos throat
<Vivix> What Joke
<DoctoDoctorWho> ValtheJean: Im pretty sure we dont have trekkie grade nerds yet
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we're getting close -_
<ValtheJean> 2,14 -_-*
<Vivix> Yeah, we're getting there
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, oh we actually have
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> it was bad and you should feel bad
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony
<Vivix> I like talking ad length about--lore implications by episodes, I'm pretty sure that's half trekkie
<Spectrum_Rush> hey the kids wanted extreme
<Vivix> Oh brain
<alexxm> how are things LightTrooper105
<the_real_pony_1604> I have told that to someone
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the only difference is that we don't bug our VAs (yet) about the nerdy theories
<LightTrooper105> doing fine alexxm and you?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> ...yet...
<Vivix> yeah, we shouldn't do that- if anything ,we should bug jayson
<alexxm> i'm good LightTrooper105
<CrimsonPhoenix> ValtheJean, we haven't?
<Vivix> Hehe, this is Simpson's writers response to Simpsons fans
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but sending a god damn volume of a fanfiction to Tabitha is just as bad...hell it's even worse than trekkies
<DoctoDoctorWho> ValtheJean: I've heard of trekkie conventions where 2 fans who, under normal circumstances, liked eachother and would go out to date, instead reinacted the klingon mating dance.
<alexxm> Vivix whos jayson
<Vivix> Jayson Thiessen
<alexxm> oh ok
<Vivix> Showrunner and producer
<Vivix> basically doing what faust did before she quit
<Vivix> He's the lore god now-
<Phase4> ValtheJean, wait... what?
<Phase4> theres tabitha fanfiction?
<Vivix> Tabitha got FoE book as a gift
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Phase4 you didn't know about that?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they sent her the fully printed volume of FoE to Tabitha
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....
<Phase4> Oh, the finfic prints
<CrimsonPhoenix> why
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because yeah, the VAs in the show want to see how we bastardize their hard work
<Phase4> i heard about that a while ago
<Vivix> For fun, I guess
<DoctoDoctorWho> FoE?
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/tabithas-fallout-equestria-collection.html
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Fallout Equestria
<DoctoDoctorWho> ah
<CrimsonPhoenix> who would thought that was a good idea
<Vivix> That was based on eh..that dude..
<ValtheJean> 2,14 CrimsonPhoenix: I have no idea
<DoctoDoctorWho> still not as wierd as trekkies reinactiong the klingon mating dance...
<Vivix> I dunno, I think it was just some guy no affiliated with the printing
<Phase4> those lousey writers
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean F:E might be decent and all but still.....
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a videogame, show crossover
<Vivix> I love FoE, but- yeah, I don't she's gonna read it, but gifts are gifts
<Vordox> Phase4: I GIVE UP!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Vivix: there's a difference between gifts and self-serving ego rubs
<Vordox> Screw Haxe, Screw C#, Screw HTML5.
<Vivix> Of course, but it's not like it was sent by anyone involved in the printing
<Phase4> :(
<Vordox> Phase4: To Game Maker I go(Pre Load function with EASY use! And INSTANT live stream sounds!) Even if ALOT of people hate it..
<Vordox> I CAN MAKE IT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Doesn't excuse it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's still despicable that we would flaunt that shit in the faces of people who put time and effort to bring us entertainment
<Vordox> Time to work overtime on Vector to Sprite. -.-
<Vivix> We didn't do anything, one guy did, I don't see why I should be annoyed at him
<Phase4> i have to go now, my planet needs me
<CrimsonPhoenix> BEST THING EVER
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Vivix> Animation Cell visible
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because it was on behalf of the fandom, regardless of whether you did it or not, someone is representing YOU in that way
<Vordox> Phase4: Very much :P
<Vivix> No, I don't feel represented by the actions of others-
<alexxm> i have to go now my planet needs me
<AdamTheDuck> Dat "YOU" :<
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well that's great that you don't feel that way, it doesn't change how the people who work on the show are being exposed to the fandom
<Vivix> No, of course not, but she has a choise not to read it, and she probably won't
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it doesn't matter if she reads it, the point is that we SENT it to her in the first place
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chances are she'll be gardening instead
<Vivix> I don't really see why that matters to anyone
<DoctoDoctorWho> subject change?
<Vivix> I hardly think any of the VA's care
<Vordox> I HEAR MITTENNACHT! <3
<DoctoDoctorWho> woot 4 mitternacht!
<Vordox> <--- Why is MLP so awesome looking...
<Vordox> ValtheJean: Is there some lag?
<Vivix> Animators and storyboards <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> ValtheJean, what's the reference in this video?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Only discord would know how to speak germen
<ValtheJean> 2,14 reference? It's a PMV...
<CrimsonPhoenix> well the music then
<alexxm> damn german discord is awesome
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Mitternacht
<DoctoDoctorWho> CrimsonPhoenix: Miternacht means midnight in german
<Vordox> ValtheJean: *Snicker* But do you know there's a slight sound lag? Or visual lag? It's minor but meh :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> heh....fitting
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Vordox: that happens to pretty much everyone's streams
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's just how it works
<Vordox> ValtheJean: :( Damnit Stream. Well, still great stream and community
<Vordox> Thank you ValtheJean <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, what sound lag, visual lag?
<Lyra`> du hosty
<Vivix> lag the video to compensate, dunno if that's suppoted in the capture software though
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Some sound/visual lag making it unsync(The eye of a game designer)
<Lyra`> i want everyone here to know, that i love ValtheJean
<DoctoDoctorWho> Germans sound perpetually angry, I wonder why.
<Vordox> GO go Octi!
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Nah. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the desynch is caused by how the machine communicates with the server, which then communicates with our embed
<Lyra`> IN A SFW kinda way :3
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: You should hear ENGLISH people!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's unavoidable
<Vivix> I've talked to two germans in real life, one sounded super nice and sweet, other sounded REALLY angry
<Vordox> ValtheJean: And the signal from visual and sound are 2 complete different channels. Eeyup
<the_real_pony_1604> there are a lot of strong K sounds
<ValtheJean> 2,14 You can stop sucking up to me Lyra`, I'm not going to ban you unless you break a rule
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't really see any desync on my end
<Lyra`> who's sucking up :3
<AdamTheDuck> ValtheJean, oh she's just being Lyra` :P
<Vordox> Hai random Scootaloo?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 If I had a nickel for every time I heard that...
<Lyra`> someone must have put a 'want it need it' spell on you babe~
<Vordox> Phase4: Currently going through every code in my head, I'll try and make a quick demo within this month.
<Lyra`> who else
<Vordox> Phase4: We'll see how that goes. :P Shame only PC users can play it though
<Lyra`> wants/needs ValtheJean?
<Phase4> Vordox, yeah, maybe it can be ported later though
<Vordox> We'll see.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh lawl
<Phase4> dat aol
<Vordox> <--- Also that load
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: are you saying the english language sounds angry?
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: The British ones sounds... Well mot angry, but sOMETHING. :P
<alexxm> ah old timey AOL
<Vivix> You know what language sounds the copmlete opposite to angry? Swedish
<the_real_pony_1604> can I put in a request for the next episode after this one?
<DerpyMuffins> AOL still in business?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> everyone dies
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok that's impossible
<alexxm> it lives
<Vordox> Phase4: Also.. You knwo something fun?
<Phase4> Vordox, yeah?
<Lyra`> ahaha
<Vordox> Phase4: I just checked the price tags on people with games from USA, Sweden and Australia...
<Vordox> USa gets is SHIT cheap...
<Vordox> Compared to anyone else
<AdamTheDuck> Vordox, ikr
<Vordox> And funnily, they are complaining the most. :P
<Phase4> ikr
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vordox: British accents sound silly to non brits
<Vivix> Everything in USA is cheap- even vintage instruments
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Vordox: that's because most of the companies are IN the US
<Vordox> DoctoDoctorWho: Sounds weird, but aawesome. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not having to pay exporting costs goes a long way
<AdamTheDuck> ValtheJean, but what about digital games?
<Vivix> Food, instruments, cars- houses--
<Vordox> ValtheJean: Japan stuff cheaper in USA. :P
<Vordox> ValtheJean: Just compare the price of RE6 in all euroapan places.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 most of those companies are based in US
<Lyra`> kinda cookie and fun :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 as for Digital, you got me
<Phase4> ValtheJean, yeah, steam prices are higher here
<Phase4> no aparent reason
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the price of games doesn't translate at all
<alexxm> compleate with dead midget
<Vordox> Okay, let's be honest here now ValtheJean, In Sweden the RE6 cost 699 Kronor(SEK)
<Vordox> In USA it costs...
<Vordox> (If you compare the 699 to Dollars)
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> they get the US $ price and just apply it to other currency without converting it
<Vordox> 104,27 Dollar
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Which I have no idea how much that's worth in $
<Vordox> Do you PAY that much for RE6?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 to be fair
<Phase4> Discombobulator
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a lot of european countries have rediculous gaming regulations
<Vordox> And in Australia, 699 SEK is 101,94 Aus
<Vordox> Do you PAY that much, Phase4 ?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and so companies have to make separate euro versions for some games
<Vivix> but it's not just games
<Phase4> dat pin pals
<Vivix> it's most things
<Jmo> lololol
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> pretty sure the price stuff is just laziness
<Jmo> Australian Game prices
<Jmo> ahahah
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Lyra`> oof
<Vivix> AUS prices..you poor poor man Jmo
<alexxm> continuity nod
<Phase4> Vordox, thats why i can't buy new games
<Jmo> Watta joke
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> and that fact that they can get away with it
<Lyra`> palpate for TIC :3
<Vordox> Phase4: It costs that much? O.o Over 100 Aus?
<AdamTheDuck> Vordox, usually 80 to 100
<Phase4> a lot of games get released at 120AUD
<Vordox> Anyway, next time I see someone complain about EXPENSIVE games, I'll slap 'em .:P
<Lyra`> rawr~
<Vordox> AdamTheDuck: Then I can feel for you guys too
<Vordox> But next time... *SLAP* the spoiled people =P
<Vivix> Indeed
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> that is why a lot of stuff is region locked to keep you from importing the stuff youself for a lower price
<Lyra`> ahaha
<Lyra`> hes a homosexual :D
<Vivix> This episode had 2 pages of Do not refer to, and not suitable for broadcasting

<Phase4> Vivix, yeah, they sell things somehow and people buy them for some reason
<Vivix> waat? Oh right- they went money
<Malavolent> Phase4: So basically Arch is better for me?
<Vivix> I kinda want to mess with linux again, but--I dunno what's going on anymore
<Phase4> red hat sells suport for red hat linux afaik
<Vivix> Oh okay
<Vivix> I also don't know what I'd do in linux, I'm not doing much...computery things, other than drawroom project

<Panda> Jmo... who is... that PONYPOWER guy? I havent seen him around.
<applejack`> i'm too.
<applejack`> Panda: you see me around here ?
<applejack`> y
*PONYPOWER says applejack`loves everything
<applejack`> fail :C
<PONYPOWER> Panda, you know im everywere...
<Panda> applejack`, well I recognize your name for sure as worst pony :P
<applejack`> worst? what is worst?
*applejack` needs google translate
<applejack`> I'M GONNA TO KILL YOU!
<Panda> :3
<Barbetos> aight.
<Barbetos> Anyone else get the war z?
*PONYPOWER is BACK
<Panda> nope
<Barbetos> I think Jmo did
<Jmo> You're gonna regret it.
<Vivix> <,<--sadly
<Barbetos> I already got it
<Vivix> me too
<Barbetos> =P
<Vivix> ehh..
<Vivix> it might be a fraud, well most likely
<Barbetos> It seems like it
<Barbetos> But at the same time it is legit
*Vivix shrugs
<PONYPOWER> you dont KNOW ME.
<Vivix> life lesson I guess
<Barbetos> I think it has been vapor ware for a while
*applejack` feels resentful :C
<Vivix> hn
<Barbetos> They fixed it from yesterday
<Barbetos> Actually I downloaded it if that is what you mean
<Vivix> yeah, I've tried it, eh buggy, but thats typical for early dev alpha
<Vivix> but it's the things around that seem---yeah
<Barbetos> things around?
<Vivix> Yeah, I don't remember most of it. ToE is copy pasted from LoL, and apparentlyy--? some things are copy pasted from other sources too
<Jmo> Aight sorry, I'm back.
*Vivix throws hands in air
<Vivix> IUNO
<Jmo> The developers of War Z are a POS
<Panda> o/ see you fillies later, I'm gonna go draw and stuff and no Jmo, I will not be drinking today :3
<Jmo> Bai Panda
<AdamTheDuck> Just watched a quick gameplay of War Z...
<Barbetos> Is it the stick up the ass running?
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh...
<applejack`> who likes me?
*Panda|DrawingandStuf likes applejack`
<applejack`> :))
<Jmo> They copied the ToS from LoL, they've copied lots of stuff from games, they created one of the worst games in history (Big Rigs)
<Jmo> And they've lied about their history.
<Barbetos> Also I bludgeoned a dude with my flash light yesterday just to get binoculars in war z
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Panda|DrawingandStuf
<Barbetos> And I stole his food and water.
<Jmo> They say they have worked on several games, but there is no proof.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> though... all the applejack fanart ive done was of suggestive material....
<Vivix> Emotion is good, suggestive is emotion in some form
<Jmo> I regret funding them.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sylandest!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Sylandest> Panda|DrawingandStuf: morning, panda
*Panda|DrawingandStuf glomps the shit out of Sylandest

<AdamTheDuck> Barbetos, but... but... Whaaa... All these gameplay videos, does not one conserve ammo? It's a zombie apocalypse afterall :<
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sylandest of course :3 he challenged me to a drinking game though. He lost so we walked home and I hopped on IRC and incoherent chat was everywhere. Deathstar got a kick out of it though XD
<Sylandest> Panda|DrawingandStuf: I'm sure she would, lol. Drunk panda is one of the best pandas

<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sylandest, how did midnot hold up last night? I see he got good with fiddle... that rat bastard.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh... War Z isn't gearing towards being a simulator... It's more like an rpg...
<Sylandest> Panda|DrawingandStuf: he managed fine. I sent him to bed straight away though. He was exhausted.
*applejack` looks at PONYPOWER

*PONYPOWER actually kills my Pc
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sylandest, well midnot was feeling down so I thought of something to cheer him up
*PONYPOWER is not me hes a spy
<Sylandest> Panda|DrawingandStuf: Ahhh, right, I saw that. Its a good idea :)
<Lyra`> sounds like something a spy would say.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sylandest, so school today?
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Lyra`!!!!
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah... I don't think I would like War Z... :/
*Panda|DrawingandStuf glomps Lyra`

<Twi_Fi> Panda|DrawingandStuf: I've been okay.
<applejack`> Panda|DrawingandStuf: percent of fragmenting my disk: 84%
<applejack`> :C
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Twi_Fi, just ok? :/ nothing spectacular?
<Twi_Fi> Rarely is life spectacular.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> applejack` pft, needs to be about 20% cooler
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Twi_Fi, yup, thats adulthood for you.
<Twi_Fi> Unfortunately.
*PONYPOWER is 21% uncooler
<Twi_Fi> How have you been, Panda|DrawingandStuf?
<Ryunosuke> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/356/570/73e.jpg --- sooooo true :)
<Jmo> Rofl
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Twi_Fi, I've been well, just work and school for me. Still trying to master art... though its ever so fleeting.
<BoroBrony> so true so true
<Barbetos> So someo ne here has kidnapped the streamers.
<Jmo> Vivix did.
<Barbetos> I mean, why else would there be no stream?
<Vivix> WAT
<Barbetos> Well
<Barbetos> ?
<Barbetos> Where are they?
<Vivix> Eh
<Vivix> not in my bed
<Jmo> Liar.
<Sylandest> Barbetos: I have taken them as part of my master plan for more AJ. You cannot stop me!
<Vivix> Honest!
*PONYPOWER is in bad touch.
<Vivix> They're in the basement
<Barbetos> Vivix aw you have the best parties.
<Barbetos> y u no invite me
<Vivix> Hehe
*PONYPOWER is in bad touch cause GERMANY wont get seasone 2.
<Vivix> Cuz..cuz they private parties
*Barbetos not bronystate mod
<Barbetos> Racists!
<Barbetos> =P
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sylandest, why do you and Sumi love her so much...
<Vivix> Aww Yeaah
<Vivix> Only horses are invited to my parties
<Sylandest> Panda|DrawingandStuf: because AJ is awesome. Nuf said
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Sylandest AJIsAwesome|Asleep?
<Jmo> >.>
<Sylandest> Panda|DrawingandStuf: Yes, that AJ, and all other AJ nicknames, and Applejack especially herself
<Barbetos> AJ is pretty cool
<Barbetos> She is currently my favorite pony.
<Barbetos> ;#
<Barbetos> ;3
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> PFT
<Barbetos> Well its true
<Barbetos> Rarity was my first though
<Barbetos> And that sounds wrong
<Vivix> She's everyones first..
<Barbetos> Or right to some people.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> and screw you Sylandest and our friendship! I now have... 30 drawigns of AJ and only 6 of Rarity .__.
<Vivix> Hehe, I think my first fav pony was Fluttershy
<Vivix> now its Fluttershy Rarity and Pinkie in a mix-
<Sylandest> p4ngya: hehehe, behold her power!
<Sylandest> her
<Barbetos> Fluttershy has never been favorite pony for me
<Sylandest> * Panda|DrawingandStuf
<Sylandest> watever
*Panda|DrawingandStuf loved Rarity before it was cool.
<Barbetos> I just don't buy into her cuteness for some reason
<Vivix> She fits me so well, her faults and such remind me of me
<Barbetos> Shy girls turn me off I guess.
<Vivix> I can see that-
<Jmo> >_>
<Vivix> yeah, everyones different in that, I more relate to her than attract to her I guess
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> I dated someone like fluttershy... only thing good about it was... well... nvm
<Jmo> You all like ponies
<Jmo> Gaaay
<Vivix> Kinda like--before I started working--in 2008, I didn't go outside for abot 2 years I think
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Jaymoo pls, you leik teh poniez too
<BoroBrony> my girl is shy and i think its really cute i am really good with people and she gets really scared with new people so i have to be with her if she goes to meet someone :)
<Vivix> Jmo is not gaay ;__; s equinophile
<Vivix> I have to have someone with me when I go to new places
<Vivix> or don't know how to get back home
<Barbetos> Panda|DrawingandStuf See I did that too. I dated a chick that was really shy, and well, it just got annoying
<Jmo> Rofl
<Barbetos> So I think it reflects in my feelings for Fluttershy
<Jmo> You have no proof
<Jmo> Thanks <3
<Vivix> Could be
<Vivix> !
<Jmo> Vivix Shut it.
<Jmo> >>>
<Vivix> nuh!
<Vivix> FUK IT
<Barbetos> but I am pretty sure if I got stuck in a room with an obnoxious girl (RD) I probably would like fluttershy more
<Vivix> but, Shy is not the same as anxiety issues
<Vivix> and I think fluttershy is more anxiety ish than shy at some points
<Vivix> You know when she was afraid to tell her friends she couldn't go see the dragon, a very real issue sometimes
<Barbetos> Oh great.
<Barbetos> Coffee on my pants
<Vivix> You can't tell anyone no, in case they reject you because of it, so you say yes. maybe, and avoid and lie
<Barbetos> Yes I am really ReALLY happy to see you. o_o
<BoroBrony> my girlfriend reminds me of fluttershy sometimes its really cute :)
<Barbetos> gag me
<Barbetos> Sorry I just.
<Barbetos> Yeah
<Jmo> wut.
<Vivix> Wat
<Barbetos> That would be annoying to me
<Barbetos> Shy girlfriend ruined it for me
<Barbetos> or ex I should say
<Vivix> yeah
<Barbetos> Poor fluttershy has to get my flutterhate becuase of it.
<Barbetos> TAINT FaIR
<Vivix> It's not a bad thing that you don't like it- its just how it is
<Jmo> Want a tissue diddums?
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Barbetos... well, as they say, the shy quiet ones are best in bed.
<Barbetos> Vivix I really dislike it, yeah. Hate is not the right word. I just have other internalized issues: I don't like a pony? wut?
<Barbetos> It freaks me out
<Barbetos> Don't judge me
<Barbetos> I am odd and I know it
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> We're all odd in some places
<TheMonstaMuffin> Yo everypony!
<Jmo> Expecially you.
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Vivix you especially~
<Jmo> OH SNAP
<Vivix> Oh I'm freaked out
<Panda|DrawingandStuf> Jmo /)
<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo> (\
<Vivix> I am very odd- and have a lot of hangups, but that's fiiiiiiine *twilight grin*
*Panda|DrawingandStuf shivers
<Jmo> YOLO
<Vivix> CASH
<Jmo> SWAG
<Vivix> NAILED IT
<Barbetos> *sex joke here*
<Barbetos> Right? riiiigghttt
<Vivix> *inappropriate comment*
<Jmo> Nop
<Vivix> I'd check her carborators!
<Jmo> Keep it to yoself.
<Barbetos> you killed the chat.
<Barbetos> We have to share to progress
<Jmo> Good.
<Jmo> Stay dead.
*Panda|DrawingandStuf kills the chat
<Barbetos> And admiting you have a problem is the first step
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/XSHaG.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01adorable moth!
<Vivix> So true Barbetos
<Saturn> 08,01is adorable!
<Vivix> and your name makes me think of Barbados
<Vivix> which I think..is a place..
<Barbetos> "My name is John, and I love ponies. I brought my vynil scratch tshirt and plushie."
<Barbetos> =P
<Vivix> "Hello, John."
<MadSurge> Saturn: awww >3

<Vivix> I don't really like that kinda bug physique-
<Barbetos> What do you like in a bug?
<donutpop365> School, bye.
<Barbetos> Not a pervy joke, just btw
<donutpop365> Concentration :D
<Barbetos> So don't do it.
<MadSurge> And here I come learning about an utter bugfuck insane Japanese RPG... why do I always end up looking those up :D
<Vivix> I'm not sure- I kinda like moth's
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I dunno, I like how some bugs look, but others just freak me out. Like spiders
<Barbetos> Spiders are cool
<Barbetos> But they freak me out
<Barbetos> Yeah
<Barbetos> My brain confuses me
<Barbetos> Want to trade?
<Vivix> Nah
<Barbetos> It is a woman
<Barbetos> It has a sexy voice
<Barbetos> It also has a plethora of useless information, and knows enough IT to get by.
<Vivix> Hmm
<Vivix> Well, mines..eh
<Vivix> weirddd?
<Vivix> Not TOO weird- I guesss
*Vivix shuts up
<Barbetos> Barbetos is now in dum, brain is mad at him. it is off.
<Barbetos> duuuurrrrr
<Vivix> brain think's you're cheatin
<Vivix> she be closin you offf bro
