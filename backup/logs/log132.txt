<Jon> anyone mind sending someone or calling some pegasuses?
<Flutterspy1> It rained here in austin

<SodapopFizz> I.. kind of like them all except Pinkie Pie..
<MuNova> Scootaloo: Call it a dildo instead and I approve >_>
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Applejack and Rarity show off how Dog and Cat owners act accordingly to their pet of choice. Applejack's behavior resembles that of a canine (messy eating/clenliness, jumping into bed) whereas Rarity's character is more feline-esque (picky about details, down to being extremely specific about her sleeping area)
<Blue2> Sleepover by the book
<Jon> I already said that slurrymoon
<DSNesmith> spike is in the basement
<hmc1> cobblestone penis would be a good plan
<PinkaminaDianePie> @sosweetandtasty I really enjoyed Rarity's dead panning all throughout this episode.
<Patrtap> I love all of them
<Flutterspy1> Book on how to have scret fun

<NightmareFlare> Twilight just read some Shipping. Invite Rarity and Applejack over for "Sleepover"

<Wego> Oh god MuNova... OH GOD.
<mib_6atvp8> a tree branch within a tree...
*MuNova joines Ravager
<PinkaminaDianePie> This is defiantly not by the book!
<Buytoast> She's generously letting Spike work for her in exchange for plot examining.
<Lumi> OCD even in the face of danger
<DSNesmith> Applejack is the bigger pony here, I'm sad to say
<cirek> In this episode Twilight is dimmer than usual
<Rodman> TREECEPTION!
<Vergil> Twilight: reads 200 books a day, master of magic; can't figure out how to get a tree out of her window.
<MuNova> Wego: AHAHAHAHA. xP

<SodapopFizz> Clearly this counts as camping.
<sosweetandtasty> Twilight is so obliviuse

<Nyst> *ploink* sound effect
<Thunder_Dash> I wonder if the visit they're talking about is the one in Ep22
<Fengor> You just know Celestia is the one who set the parasprites loose on ponyville
<DSNesmith> "Um, Princess? I was wondering, if, uh..."
<Jon> Fillydelphia.
<mike_perruno> ahhh yeah...a ... parade... of ... para sprites
<Jon> Yeah...
<MuNova> Luna: Then I love you. Celestia is enchanting

<WolfX> i dont think cel can really be a god.
<Lumi> SECURE THAT SHI-
<Mezkalito> 0Pinkie knew they were parasprites, Celestia didn't, your argument is invalid
<ThePretender> The Trouble with tribbles?
<Sir> lol DSN

<cbpony9001> FHILLYDELPHIA WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED
<SuperBrony64> Probably the Parasprite Ball they rolled
<lesserpoet> dat face
<DSNesmith> that comic made me lol so hard
<Hanbark> Holy fuck 6 hours to go BRONiES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Celestia mentions Fillydelphia, which was what Lauren Faust wanted to Name Ponyville. Executive Meddling forced her to change the name to Ponyville and use Fillydelphia as a cameo name. It's suppose to be a reference to Philladelphia, which is where Faust's family lives.
<lololol> when dis fuckin show start!?
<FlaschenJoe11> DSNesmith: best comic this week
<TripFoalins> cel is sun god
<mib_ekrakz> I've learn Pinkie breaks every rule. The end
<Blue2> I guess it's not sunny in philadelphia
<Owlowiscious> DSNesmith: Honestly, didn't really get it.
<Thunder_Dash> How do we know that Celestia doesn't know what parasprites are? :P
<KanyeEast> i think its better not to be fillydelphia
<ThePretender> YEEEEEEEAAAAAH
<DSNesmith> I didn't even know it was an aliens reference until fluttershy said chickenshit
<WolfX> she has no father or mother mentioned anywhere, but a sister? explain.
<CourtyardDroll> Silverscreen: DUDE. Nice fact
<Hat> So Faust lives in Ponyville?
<KanyeEast> because otherwise every other plot would involve driveby shootings
<DSNesmith> then I was like LOOOOOOL
<Thunder_Dash> She could be lying, she /is/ a troll after all
<a041744> Fillydelphia = Phildelphia WAT?!
<CourtyardDroll> We're all learning so much together.
<japanesebrony> princess celestia why u no queen!!!!!!!
<Legato> So will this stream have Season 2?
<Disco_Bandit> I learned that a tuba is the only answer.

<Ravager> HA
<Lumi> LOL REFERENCE
<DSNesmith> I must tell him this

<cbpony9001> FAUST IS OFFICIALLY IN EQUESTRIA
<Mezkalito> 0well duh
<DSNesmith> or just start referring to it as fillydelphia
<Fengor> so what you're saying Silverscreen, is that Faust condemned her family to the horrors of a parasprite infestation?
<TripFoalins> Remember kids you can solve any problem with loud music
<mike_perruno> epic tuba pony
<Revolver> HAVE TUBA WILL TRAVEL!
<Oviletti> Mezkalito, que hora es allá?

*Thetrollside fuck it
<Lumi> Incoming OCD...
<Zed_> I love this whole bit. Twilight makes an abomination unto bird's nests and Rarity can't just let it go.
<mike_perruno> fucking lazy birds
<Fengor> In twilight's defence, the nest she makes resembles an actual bird's nest more than Rarity's
*Thetrollside hugs Luna

<Owlowiscious> crackeranddip: No colors.
<Jon> is that.
<Legato> Nailed it!

<Vergil> Because Kamina is best everything, ever/

<ThePretender> ...NOT IN THAT WAY. A man can't reference an old Konami game?
<themarewhoarrangesth> lol outhouse
<SuperBrony64> Luna: Try telling that to Rarity and her birds nests :P
<Zed_> There's a reason my hair is compared to a bird's nest. Nests aren't usually very "neat." Rarity is making baskets, not really nests.
<CrazyPie> hahahaha
<Lemon_The_Pegasus> Haha. XD
<Celestia> PLOT! PLOT! PLOT RIGHT THAR!

<RayneJCyro> Cupcakes is ridiculous. Dash is indestructible, EVERYBODY knows that.
<Choco> FAIL
<FlaschenJoe11> Cupcakes followed by The Light in the Darkness
<Wego> Applebloom rolled a 1 on walking.
<mib_ev2s0m> gasp
<Thunder_Dash> I still stand by my stance that the only reason they're pricks like this is because their cutie marks pretty much say "HEY EVERYPONY, MY SPECIAL TALENT IS BEING RICH AND USELESS!"
<Blendtec> dat song
<mike_perruno> oh shit
<Nyst> Noo, I can't watch!
<ThePretender> counter troll maneuver, successful

*eXAKR smacks DiamondTiara with an iPad
*MuNova informs those curious that Cupcakes is gruesome, and don't read it unless you're ready for some disturbing stuff.
<Jon> NINJA CUTIEMARK.

<NelBell> Cupcakes really isn't that bad. I thought it was a satire of movies like Saw and Hostel. *shurgs* But I'm a girl-brony so I'm a strange one.
<Zed_> TO THE RESCUE
<crackeranddip> 0so HA
<RainbowFox> I liked Cupcakes. It was worth reading more for the brony culture than the story itself, though.
<KanyeEast> a manipulation cutie mark would have david xanatos on it

<cbpony9001> THE ILLUMINATI WAS A BETTER NAME THAN CMC
<Buytoast> Oh fun.
<PinkaminaDianePie> @SuperBrony Well I'd agree with you, save for the fact that Scootaloo is a pegasus and Cherilee is an earth pony.
<mib_m7k7u8> what's PT?
<Buytoast> Blank flank ending
<Patrtap> The Light in the Darkness is amazing
<MuNova> FUTURE EP ABOUT HOW CELESTIA AND LUNA GOT THEIR CUTIE MARKS, PLOX
<Jon> I think i figured out how tia sends the letters back

<Wego> Making a reference to the Cupcakes story would be the meanest thing that they could possibly do on the show.
<Zed_> Luna fighting against invading aliens from her moon base.
<Stonegaze> I've been here since the G3 movie.

<CourtyardDroll> WELL TECHINCALLY, she has seen a Rainboom.
<SuperBrony64> Casper: You at http://www.bronystate.net?
<a_person> yeah twi
<Thetrollside> exactly rayneJcyro, nobody here can spell her name right
<Wego> Pinkie didn't know she saw a Rainboom.
<Rainboom27> 0this episode makes more sense to me if Dash explained the rainboom
<SuperBrony64> Pinkie Pie must have been a Pegasus Pony before...
<mib_81qcmd> Testing
<Casper> Okay, low quality works
<Legato> She just say Joy. Ever Lasting Joy
<RayneJCyro> Thetrollside: Straight up.
<Squeejee> Actually, wasn't her back to the window when the rainboom went off? IO thought the sound of it startled her.
<MuNova> riverhippo: It's what this fembrony is doing. lol
<a_person> ill be baaack
<Mezkalito> 0THE EYES

<BronyBrian> dont be a bitch dash
<LSRagnarok> >The Bro Ponies say that the Sonic Rainboom is just an old pony's tail
<LSRagnarok> >They were there when it happened
<Dinky_Doo> secret butt fun
<Kammerjunk> Isn't Dash trying to use a visible Mach cone (I can't believe I said that)?
<LSRagnarok> The fuck?
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> horn to the flank must hurn

<Mezkalito> 0this isn't my hat
<Six> I almost hate rarity at the end of this episode :P
<hmc1> yep
<Thetrollside> well ragnarok, one of them was knocked out in a pillar, the other falling and out of control
<Wego> Pinkie knows EVERYTHING. She could probably do that spell herself.
<SuperBrony64> This comic makes me cry :( http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/229/3/0/memories_by_capt_nemo-d46ycwc.png
<Rainbow-Fox> I think the Bro Ponies are in a state of straight up denial.
<Nyst> That mach cone was disproved in that youtube physics presentation
<Frostys_Den> http://starlightspark.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-Pie-s-hidden-Talent-252783619?offset=offset
<RayneJCyro> LSRagnarok: Well, they're all asshats, and at least one of them crashed into something. perhaps they suffered memory loss?
<CourtyardDroll> Deus Ex Pinkamena
<Nyst> A mach cone appears after breaking the sound barrier (I believe)
<Legato> For Pony

<Killsteal_Wolf> More magic like this in season 2 please.
<BronyBrian> i heard tardis noiases
<P0n3Swag> they should have tested it on big mac
<Kammerjunk> @Nyst Yeah, but it just seems like the artists tried to use it anyway.
<Thunder_Dash> inb4Derpy
<Roq> Hi!

<a_person> RARITY IS BUTTERFLY
<Nyst> Now she can fight the Smooze!
<Zip> big mac eh?
<mib_si8u5i> DERPY!
<mib_dq55u7> derpy
<Wego> Someone needs to make a fic of that. Deus Ex with Rainbow Dash losing her wings and getting robotic ones.
<Mezkalito> 0Rainbow Dash is not amused
<Kammerjunk> Derpy can be 5 places at once.
<mib_si8u5i> its pnys like those three that make Dash a lez
<Jon> that spell that rarity is using
<Glowlight> HEY! I think we should take a moment to thank Bronystate Theatre for putting on a awesome marathon =)
<MuNova> Derpeh
<SuperBrony64> I like the Big Mac comic
<Legato> Assertive
<RayneJCyro> Wego: that. would be. amazing.
<Jon> is the only remains of the flutterponies
<Killsteal_Wolf> Losing wings seem to be something important soon.
<RayneJCyro> I should write that.
<a041744> the cloudosium >.>
<Hat> Many ponies were killed in the Ponysseum
<Mezkalito> 0wingboner everywhere
<Mezkalito> 0dem teen ponies..
<Frostys_Den> yes, applause for bronystate
<Jon> . .
<Jon> wow.
<RayneJCyro> Fluttershy sucks at reassuring.
<MuNova> I love how Rainbow looks here
<Joel95> -_
<Applejosh> Hi Everypony
<Joel95> ya
<Hat> thanks Bronystate
<Slowter> Love the architecture
<SuperBrony64> MY LIFE IS RUINED!!
<Wego> Kammerjunk, Derpy just spreads her derp to others so that they get too confused.
<GabeMoist> lolfluttershy
<MuNova> With the "whatever" look. lol
<BlankFlankBrony> Huzzah for BronyState!
<Joel95> y
<Peanut> bad encouragement
<RayneJCyro> MuNova: Me too
<GrimGallop> lol
<Mezkalito> 0you are tearing me apart Lisa!
<Dinky_Doo> RAINBOW FACTORY
<Denied_Existence> 3Your welcome
<Nyst> Yes, thank you Fluttershy. Just what she needed.
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> or to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<PK-Gaming> Hooray for pressure
<tiktalik> I have sworn off ponies until the episode airs.
<Killsteal_Wolf> Celestia... banishes every failure pony.
<BlankFlankBrony> Return of the flutter pony style!
<MuNova> SUCH CONFIDENCE
<SuperBrony64> Rarity just got better.
<Legato> omg a flying marshmellow.
<MuNova> RayneJCyro: ;D
<hmc1> dash hardly
<CourtyardDroll> SMASHING!
<LSRagnarok> You realize that Rarity is now a pseudo-alicorn
<mib_si8u5i> Rari-free used fly
<Hedrah> Buttwings
<Kammerjunk> Need... More... Coffee...
<mib_dq55u7> 0rarity is a rutterfly
<tiktalik> I have sworn off ponies until the episode airs.
<Wego> I think Ponies in general suck at reassuring RayneJCyro. Fluttershy isn't the only one who tells somepony that.
<Zip> I don't like how the wings are attached so low on her back
<Sicktick> A flying bitch you mean....
<Legato> Dah Balloon!
<a041744> IT TWILIGHT SPRAPKLES BAWOON
<ObeseLobster> STAY ON TARGET Kammer
<hmc1> oops, forgot to erase part of a comment i was writing earlier
<Joel95> Lol I'm watching the marathon... and just got that I'm listening to music, not to the episodes xD
<a_person> OMNOMG SO PWETTY
<Nyst> I love the architecture of Cloudsdale
<SuperBrony64> lol at Pinkie Cart Wheel
<Shutterflu> What
<NoOne> test
<Slowter> A hot air balloon w/out any heat source/
<RayneJCyro> I think if I drink any more caffeine tonight my heart will probably explode.
<Shutterflu> Someone took Shutterfly
<Shutterflu> >:I
<Rainbow-Fox> @LSRagnarok: Ooh, has anyone written a fanfic about that? About someone using magic to fake being an alicorn?
<Applejosh> I hate to sound rude, but the livestream is full, correct?
<ObeseLobster> Im on my second Mega Monster
<Kammerjunk> Slowter, it makes sense because Pinkie Pie.
<Wego> S'magic Slowter! Questions aren't allowed.
<Dinky_Doo> in the rainbow factory, where your fears and horrors come true
<LSRagnarok> I don't think they have. Might be good. You intend to do it?
<Zip> eh..
<mib_dq55u7> 0rarity is high
<Peanut> night guys, see ya in 4 hours
<MuNova> Shutterflu: D:
<RayneJCyro> I should probably write down some of these fanfic concepts, but tbh I'm too busy with my Scifi novella to do any fanficcing ATM
<Hat> catcalling
<Frostys_Den> just one E-can so far. probably do another one in an hour.
<a_person> lawl
<Wego> Don't like, ALL pegasi come from Cloudsdale?
<Blue2> Inb4 rainbow hot sauce
<a_person> they all got wingboners
<Wrek> 05applejosh whatever do you mean dear?
<Rainbow_derp> haven't cracked my second reg monster yet
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> lol I used to staying up til 7AM anyway, 2 more hours is easy to endure for S2
<Kammerjunk> Somewhere far below, an unfortunate pony just got a drill to the head.
<Hedrah> Still buttwings
<LSRagnarok> OooH! It should be TRIXIE! She's sufficiently magical.
<Dinky_Doo> in the rainbow factory, where not a single soul gets through
<JustAnotherDerp> Jackhammers on clouds?
<Legato> Hey guys where's 3PO?
<Rainbow-Fox> Uh... I like the idea, but I have a different fic planned.
<LSRagnarok> And sufficiently vain.
<SuperBrony64> Hmm…if you had the choice (besides being an Alicorn), would you have the power of flight (Pegasus) or power of magic (Unicorn)? (No reason to be an Earth Pony :P)
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> I'll be running on pur hype
<CourtyardDroll> They come from above the clouds apparently, but there are more cities than Cloudsdale
<Frostys_Den> Drill to the head!
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> pure*
<Legato> then Darth Vader
<Jon> Oh hey.
<Nyst> I don't think so, but cloudsdale is pretty much like their capital city.
<Dinky_Doo> in the rainbow factory, where your fears and horrors come true
<CourtyardDroll> Unicorn.
<RayneJCyro> Pegasus.
<Thetrollside> @raynejcyro, a darksiders crossover has never been made >:/
<Jon> We're in a rainbow factory.
<PK-Gaming> Is it me or is Rarity is Icarus?
<Strigoides> gj rarity
<Thunder_Dash> SuperBrony64; Pegasus all the way.
<MuNova> pegasus
<Jon> She totally is.
<Hat> Rarity ruins winter
<Kammerjunk> SuperBrony64, it depends on what I'd do. But most likely Pegasus.
<Mezkalito> 0skittles!
<Nyst> In any case, all weather of the immediate ponyville area comes from there, so it's a pretty important town.
<Dinky_Doo> RAINBOW FACTORY IS BEST SONG
<SuperBrony64> I'd go with Pegasus. Magic is cool, but flight is better in my opinion.
<BlankFlankBrony> Spicy!
<Strigoides> nom nom rainbows
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> Earth Pony for me
<Rainbow_derp> yeah
<pmv_is_best_mv> my eyes are trying to close
<Legato> Taste the Rainbow!
<Zip> whiny :D
<pmv_is_best_mv> faggot eyes
<Squeejee> Man, I need some of that in my kitchen.
<Mezkalito> 0grow a pair!
<Frostys_Den> heh, legato
<Tiktalik> Keep in mind, Pinkie is the pony who eats hot sauce on cupcakes.
<Rainbow_derp> taste the rainbow dash
<LSRagnarok> Depends. Talent specific like these unicorns? I.E. Rarity only being able to do magic related to fashion/gems?
<Tiktalik> Casually.
<hmc1> kevin
<mib_l5xbkc> you want a pair of butterfly wings?
<Dinky_Doo> oh how orignial
<SuperBrony64> Of course, the best kind of Pony is an Alicorn.
<Wego> These guys need to be castrated. By bucking.
<RayneJCyro> I'm one of those people that should've been born with wings. I'm more comfortable in the air than on the ground.
<mib_l5xbkc> then you are girl.
<Rainbow-Fox> Unicorn all the way. Most wings are the same, but every unicorn gets different magic to match their talents.
<DSNesmith> but
<DSNesmith> wings!
<MuNova> Unicorns other than Twilight just get something relating to their specialty, anywya. And maybe levitation for everyone
<Hat> you can cast your own wings thoug
<Frostys_Den> ow, thats gotta hurt a lot man.
<Dinky_Doo> oh yeah SO BORING
<DSNesmith> inb4 best rarity moment
<LSRagnarok> If your talent is magic or wing casting.
<BronyBrian> why are all the males asshats
<MuNova> ...everypony
<Owlowiscious> Pegasus.
<Kammerjunk> If you have the magical capability, Frostys_Den
<Legato> Science at work
<Squeejee> No, spicy rainbow! Spicy Rainbow, by the way, EXCELLENT band name.
<Thetrollside> I hate being stuck on the ground sometimes, i really feel like i want to be a pilot
<SuperBrony64> Hat, yeah, but you only get them for 3 Days

<Strigoides> Good one guys!
<pmv_is_best_mv> no
<LSRagnarok> This was my first episode.
<pmv_is_best_mv> you cant hate rarity
<Nyst> It was probably very official, taking pictures and stuff, little actual talking or flying in private.
<hmc1> I hated her anyway
<RayneJCyro> I don't hate rarity, but I was not amused with her behavior.
<CourtyardDroll> Yeah, I didn't like how they kind of made Rarity a bitch in this episode. But in the rest she's good.
<Slowter> You'd think clouds would be softer
<Thetrollside> Rainbow Dash <3
<Casper> cloud punch!
<Jon> So ...close
<Jon> but so far.
*johnpony this episode would make me hate her if she didnt laugh earlier!
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> Dog and Pony Show makes up for it

<Jon> So..sleepy.
<SuperBrony64> Uh oh, not good
<Kammerjunk> Derpy can be 5 places at once.
<Dinky_Doo> Why does nobody bat an eye when they see ANOTHER unicorn with wings out there?
