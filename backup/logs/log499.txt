<sagas> Springfield: eat it with your fingers
<Springfield> MahBoi777, a lot of things. It's unhealthy and makes you unable to defend yourself.
<Viri> 14when I went to french my radio automatically switched to some french rap music
<Viri> 14awful xDD
<drfsupercenter> 03hey

<Saturn> 08,01when i'm hiring programmers, I tend to find aspies perform worse in interviews, but make better programmers, in general
<BlueFlare> 02ptt
<Aurora> 6I just don't know what went wrong
<Saturn> 08,01there are, of course exceptions to that rule
<Aurora> 6that was awful
<drfsupercenter> 03[17:51] <TimothyA> but but... I thought raping women was moral compared to pirating 10 mp3's
<drfsupercenter> 03[17:51] <TimothyA> because you only get 2-3 years for rape, and 20+ years for pirating some music
*Espeon screenshots, saves as yaoifangirlsinanutshell.jpg
<Angel_Espeon> 13the truth comes out~
<drfsupercenter> 03^ One of the best quotes I've ever read.

*BlazeAngel glomps Shizuka, but is also drinking beer
<drfsupercenter> 03slightly random question:
<Springfield> Yeah, I wouldn't be able to carry you if you were injured. It would take two strong medics and a litter to lift you
*sagas glomps Shizuka
<Viri> 14lol
<drfsupercenter> 03do trophies auto-sync when you're signed into PSN?
*Chrysalis then proceeds to glomp kirzstryfe
<drfsupercenter> 03like if I earn one while signed in
<Springfield> You're a burden in your current state, bro
<Viri> 14I remember when playing COD wasn't a joke
<Springfield> Do you have a rascal?

<drfsupercenter> 03:D
*Jim jumps late on the Shizuka glomp pile
<Espeon> 06my favorite part is when they whine for them to change things, and when there's a slight change in the new cod they complain about that
<BlueFlare> 02you've been playing with a Cod? D:
<MahBoi777> I walk like any normal person
<Springfield> How am I a dick?
<GarrettBrony> Did you know there is A Le Mis fighter?
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Springfield> I'm being honest
<Espeon> 06cod community PFFFFFFTHAHAHAHA confirmed for confusing
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently it's like
<drfsupercenter> 03"waiting for the sync something something"
<Angel_Espeon> 13Cod is a fish and nothing more
<MahBoi777> sagas: it don't bother me lol
<Espeon> 06and I think they synch
<Springfield> Sugar-coating things helps nobody
<Angel_Espeon> 13>:/
<Om> MahBoi777: Twice my weight almost xD niiiice~
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<sagas> Springfield: Your making a spectacle of his weight
<Springfield> But that's his choice to live his life how he wants
<Springfield> So?
<drfsupercenter> 03I disabled auto-sign in
<Espeon> 06at least they seem to do for me
<drfsupercenter> 03because >hacked console
<Springfield> He brought it up
<Springfield> Lol
<|Discord|> When I fell down all I do is watch Pinkie Pie and I feel better
<sagas> MahBoi777: Its still not a nice thing to do
<MahBoi777> Om: YEAAAAH
<drfsupercenter> 03so when I sign in does it sync or do I have to like, actually go view trophies
*otakon glomps Shizuka a little on the late side.
<WallDives> what about weight?
<BlazeAngel> Hey, panda.
<Springfield> It's quite a spectacle unto itself, sagas. :P
<MahBoi777> sagas: it's fiiiiiiine, I'm happy:D
<Espeon> 06i think it should do automatically. i never wait for that dumb "synching trophies" bar to move
<Saturn> 08,01Springfield: you're being disrespectful, even if you believe what you say is true
<BlueFlare> 02dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03k
<Viri> 14I liked the first COD
<drfsupercenter> 03not that I really care about trophies

<Saturn> 08,01i was tlaking to the guy who made That Lyra Plushie (tm) the other day, and i sent him that link. he didn't seem too amused; he really doesn't like the brony fandom, and made the plushie as a troll. i think it annoys him that we took it in our stride.
<Espeon> 06but feel free to add Indefinatrix if you want anyway :P
<Springfield> BANG! Work da bolt

<Espeon> 06i could rant for hours on it but i remember doing that in driving games
<Meanwhile> I like how the music ends and it's just the sounds of steel on flesh for a few seconds.

<Shimmer> Wrek: Mind your tongue, it's "buck" in here
<GarrettBrony> hey Wrek who is this music from
<Saturn> 08,01some techniques i used were quite sneaky, such as WHOIS lookups
<Soital> 12pfft I can grow tall if I want
<Chrysalis> everything is on the net if you look
<Espeon> 06oh right
<alexxm> yes i might have a job
<Viri> 14gahhh
<Soital> 12I just choose to stay pocket size
<sagas> That is impressive, Saturn
<Chrysalis> Saturn thats a little harsh
<Viri> 14msn, y u not send messages
<Viri> 14:(
<Soital> 12msn isn't working for me
<Espeon> 06good then I can be tall and such still
<Soital> 12fml
<Espeon> 06:3
<Chrysalis> though WHOIS results CAN be blocked for free
<Springfield> Who wants to go shooting with me?
<BlueFlare> 02http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-doesnt-matter-had-pikmin.png
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: that's true
<Espeon> 06msn has been dropping messages for no reason for me for months so i use it as little as possible
<Chrysalis> mine are completely hiddne
<Saturn> 08,01but a lot of people don't
<Viri> 14I can't even see some of the users sometimes
<Chrysalis> hidden*
<Saturn> 08,01especially people who don't really know about it
<Viri> 14what the heck is going on
<Soital> 12I even downloaded an odler version thanks to drf
<Soital> 12but even that isn't working
<sagas> That is very sketchy, Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01they just register their domain and have no idea
<MahBoi777> Springfield: Lol
<MahBoi777> \
<Soital> 12at least firefox is working now
<Viri> 14maybe I should download the newest version
<Viri> 14but I'm like NOPE
<Soital> 12NOPE
<RX-78-SweetieBot> NewDCD is watching you: http://derpy.me/LIuCl
<Viri> 14I'm fine with the 2009 version
<Viri> 14xD
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: it's totally not sketchy at all
<Espeon> 06exchange mario with CoD and "more gold" or whatever it says with more explosions and it's more suitable~
<Soital> 12thats what I want!
<Saturn> 08,01completely legitimate
<Chrysalis> an unfortunate amount of people just arnt aware of everything that can be got for free
<sagas> Saturn: yes it is
<Soital> 12but my computer doesn't open it
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: how?
<Soital> 12something about
<Saturn> 08,01it's publically available info
<Chrysalis> Saturn no its not, WHOIS lookups are free and legal information you put up
<Chrysalis> sag*
<Chrysalis> sagas*
<Soital> 12"this application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem"
<Soital> 12I have tried reinstalling
<alexxm> RX-78-SweetieBot the old kamen rider series were kind of goofy wern't they
<Soital> 124 times
<Chrysalis> you CHOOSe to put it up, and you can easily have it hidden
<Angel_Espeon> 13google that error message?
<Saturn> 08,01there's absolutely nothing wrong with google stalking, in my opinion
<Soital> 12yeah I have
<owlicious> Oh hey, it works for Saturn.
<Soital> 12theres some CLEAN Repair thing
<Chrysalis> jsut people dont actually look into everything thats involved with the internet
<Soital> 12not sure how legit that is
<owlicious> but that was publicly available in all likelihood
<GarrettBrony> is this Brian May?
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: see, that's the problem right there
<RX-78-SweetieBot> alexxm: not really any more than the current ones actually.
<Saturn> 08,01it's not the looking up, it's that this happens in the first place
<Soital> 12It said the same exact thing for firefox
<Soital> 12but I got that working
<Chrysalis> WTF, searching for my username, result 3 is fimfiction
<Meanwhile> There's nothing wrong with stalking. Unless you get caught.
<Saturn> 08,01"online privacy" is an oxymoron.
<Chrysalis> wtf
<owlicious> you're kidding me
<Soital> 12when I got rid of EW mcafee
<drfsupercenter> 03Soital
<drfsupercenter> 03just reinstall Windows already
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Soital> 12whats the point if its just msn not working
<Soital> 12XD
<alexxm> good point RX-78_SweetieBot
<Chrysalis> not sure if im comfortable with this
<drfsupercenter> 03because
<otakon> Saturn: um... you might want to stow that
<drfsupercenter> 03your computer is still f***ed up
<alexxm> yes i might have a job

<drfsupercenter> 03do I want a Lemmings character or a supernova for my avatar picture
<Barbetos|AtWork> That is one resiliant goblin
<otakon> Saturn: not for here
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a firm advocate of online privacy
<alexxm> thanks otakon a cafe i gave my CV to called me back about it
<Malavolent> If you look up my nickname, Google thinks that you can't spell.
*alexxm hugs RainbowJack
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i'm sorry, but are you telling me how to do my duties as a mod?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Spam that 1 key!

<Saturn> 08,01okay, maybe that was unfair
<otakon> Saturn: oh, I read your earlier post then and your take and opinion on a topic has nothing to do with your modding duties.
<sagas> otakon: That call for a paddling from Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01but i would like to know why you think it's an inapproprate topic in here
<otakon> Saturn: I mean I read it wrong.
<Meanwhile> Saturn has never been known for being particularly appropriate anyway.
<sagas> otakon: That calls for a paddling
<otakon> Saturn: still, like politics and religion let's leave it be eh?
<GarrettBrony> WHOIS sagas
<sagas> GarrettBrony: you may never know
<GarrettBrony> darn
<otakon> GarrettBrony: you have to /whois for that
<Chrysalis> Wow, 3 searches on google and i found my address on google from my username
<Saturn> 08,01i'm always appropriate in here, in accordance with our rules
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: well, i disagree with you there
<Saturn> 08,01just because something's contraversial doesn't mean we shouldn't talk abotu it
<Meanwhile> You get kinda pervy, tbh.
<Malavolent> Guys, it's just a simple whois. No big deal.

<Ninjazz> THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP TELLING ME IM ON XP! :D
<Meanwhile> I noticed.
<Viri> 14I'm getting annoyed
<HyperMetalLugia> facebook GOLD account!
<owlicious> so, what are the vulnerabilities on mac os 10.6.8? is there a mailing list?
<Viri> 14I'm on the TST forums
<Chrysalis> Saturn youd also have a reason not to do it
<Saturn> 08,01this is why the server hides all your IPs
<Wrek> 05because knowing your OS and the date
<Chrysalis> the poor guys on mac
<Viri> 14but for some reason it keeps logging me out
<Viri> 14:|
<Chrysalis> hes suffered enough
<GarrettBrony> Dont worry Shizuka being paranoid was never cool
<drfsupercenter> 03also what's the little gold trophy thing
<Meanwhile> ^
<Espeon> 06there oo
<Wrek> 05is dangerous
<drfsupercenter> 03for mine it's a 1, for yours it's a 10 etc
<Shizuka> 13it's always cool
<sagas> alexxm: Oh so you use Virgin for you internet
<Shizuka> 13keeps you sharp
<Espeon> 06it's like
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: when someone exposes their OS as, say, WinXP...
<Soital> 12ugh google why are you so useless
<otakon> lol Shizuka is now Icebox
<alexxm> hows it dangerous Wrek
<Shizuka> 13gives you lots and lots and lots of ways to doubt yourself in every way
<kirzstryfe> 8,6DWR_Drawing, do you have an avatar you use regularly, or should I pull the one from your DA?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Viri I misread your comment about thunder as "OMG TSUNDERES OUTSIDE"
<alexxm> yeah sagas
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<Wrek> 05Saturn: good point
<Espeon> 06how many trophies you have. it goes up as you collect them
<Soital> 12LMAO
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: it's just helpful to an attacker
<Soital> 12its K
<Soital> 12same
<Ray> 02.w.
*Rain picks up Shizuka and walks her over to Wrek and then hugs both of them tightly

<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<Om> I feel less safe now
<drfsupercenter> 03you have way more than 10 trophies? LOL
<Saturn> 08,01if you want to be safe, spoof your real details
<Espeon> 06LOL well yes, it doesn't increase every troph
<Saturn> 08,01if you're really paranoid
<DWR_Drawing> Uh, I like to use the one I have for skype :3
<Espeon> 06it takes more and more the higher you get, like a korean f2p mmo!
*Espeon hides
<Saturn> 08,01to be honest, it's more relevant to servers
<Barbetos|AtWork> Use piglatin?
<alexxm> how do you do that Saturn
<DWR_Drawing> Want me to upload a headshot of the image?
<Meanwhile> If you're really really paranoid go live in a cave and avoid contact with anyone.

<otakon> Rain: it's Diablo 3
<Meanwhile> Rain: It's Diablo 3. So no. Not at all.
<Shizuka> 13Chrysalis: i appreciate your lightheartedness about it, but don't be so creepy

<Shizuka> 13or i will destroy you
<Rain> ooooh

<Aurora> 6late breakfast
*otakon hugs Rain
<Meanwhile> In fact it's very much the opposite of free.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6that never sticks Shizuka, and I can basically do the same stuff with +h :p
<Rain> who the hell said it was Lemmings?
<sagas> Well it is free if they have a pirated copy out yet...
<alexxm> so does diablo 3 get repititave
<Angel_Espeon> 13what kind of breakfast? :D
<MahBoi777> hey RaveBrony!
<sagas> alexxm: it can
<Meanwhile> Rain: I thought you were joking because of the ":3c" face.
<RaveBrony> Hiya MahBoi777! :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13also thanks for reminding me how hungry I am
<otakon> alexxm: it's kill, loot, sell, repeat ofc it does.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6D3 is great when you have people to play with and bullshit
<alexxm> hey Rain hows your day been
<Barbetos|AtWork> alexxm does a bear shit in the woods?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not too fussed about having my details available on line; in fact, i encourage the sharing of my contact details
<Rain> alexxm, /every/ game gets boring if you play it enough
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: how are you?:D
<otakon> kirzstryfe: and the servers are working
<Aurora> 6hash browns and frog-in-the-hole
*GarrettBrony hits Meanwhile 's face with a book and says '' now thats a Face Book''
<Rain> good, alexxm
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's more about the craziness that happens with the people you're playing with :)
<Saturn> 08,01i think if someone wnats to contact me, they should be able to
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777: Good, and you?? :)
<alexxm> hey RaveBrony hows your day been
<Rain> also, hello otakon
*Rain hugs otakon
<Aurora> 6and chocolate milk
<Angel_Espeon> 13frog-in-the-hole?
<Saturn> 08,01but i advocate the choice of whether that should be the case or not
<Rain> and I understand, Meanwhile :p
<sagas> kirzstryfe: My enjoyment of a game should never be dependent on others
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and watching Midnight_Tempest pick up every piece of white loot that drops
*Viri throws fruits to Angel_Espeon
<Viri> 14eat :D
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: I'm doing awesome, excited
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: ya
<RaveBrony> Hiya alexxm, my day has been pretty good :P got ALOT done on my OC drawing :$ how about your day?
<Aurora> 6basically
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Yeah. That's kind of how this game I just bought is like.
<Meanwhile> Yeah Rain, sorry about that.
<Bronysith> HIYA EVERYPONY
<Angel_Espeon> 13OH wait, is that what we call Toad-in-the-hole here
<kirzstryfe> 8,6why not? it's great to play with other people
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777: For what?? :o
<Aurora> 6you take a slice of bread, cut a hole in it
<Chrysalis> kirzstryfe theres always one
<alexxm> back at college RaveBrony
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: its awesome
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: One of these days you have to sort your caps out.
<Aurora> 6put it on a buttered pan, pour scrambled egg in the hole
<Aurora> 6cook
<Aurora> 6profit
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: WHAT CAPS
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: goin to texas and Florida next month
<Angel_Espeon> 13oh, nope xD
<Chrysalis> the reason i never finished Dead Island is one of the guys i played with looted everything
<RaveBrony> alexxm: Well that sounds like, fun :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13thought you meant toad-in-the-hole
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 take a box, cut a hole in the gox
<drfsupercenter> 03*box
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: seriously.
<Chrysalis> even if it was for a different class
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: dead islands is terrible
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's funny, if you drop white loot from your own bag and he's offscreen when you do, he'll stop to pick it up because he thinks it's a drop :3
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: like this?
<Angel_Espeon> 13sausage inside a yorkshire pudding
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: better.
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777: Lucky!! I would LOVE to go back to Florida....
<drfsupercenter> 03sausage is right
*drfsupercenter runs
<Rain> sagas, some games are best with friends. If you refuse to play a game just because it is better with friends, then you need to learn how to have fun with friends
<Chrysalis> Bronysith its not, its just not what was advertised
<Chrysalis> its a fun game
<Malavolent> kirzstryfe: You're evil. I like that.
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: I've never been to Florida, I can't wait ^_^
<sagas> Rain: Not better with friends, but requires friend to be fun
<Chrysalis> kirzstryfe is there bag limits?
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777: Where in Florida are you going? :3
<Om> MahBoi777: Its just some hot pininsual
<Chrysalis> farm some low level and drop the lame whites that drop early on so he has no space
<Angel_Espeon> 13I want to say I suddenly have a craving for them but it'd sound dirty no matter how I worded it :<
<otakon> brb guys gonna check out a review
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Barbetos|AtWork> Just watch out for the zombies in florida
<drfsupercenter> 03hah
<RaveBrony> I was JUSt listening to that song :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13also
<sagas> Pick a song!
<RaveBrony> scary
<Aurora> 6I wish I could have yorkshire pudding more often
<Meanwhile> One does not simply pick a song.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been craving corn on a cob for at least a year now
<Aurora> 6my stepmom only makes it for christmas
<otakon> YES!
<Angel_Espeon> 13still haven't had one
<sagas> Oh Fallout 3
<Starflash> Yes.

<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: ummmmmm, we're not sure where we'll be stayin just yet

<Angel_Espeon> 13it be traditional to have them with Sunday dinner here every weekend, you be missing out D:
<MadSurge> <3 old timey music!
<RaveBrony> alexxm: The one with "We Are Warriors" :D
<Lasharus> Colourful in here today.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> This other game I'm playing is kind of like Diablo, but it's less focused on hack n Slash and loot and more focused on magic. It's said this game is best when played with people who aren't very good at it.
<otakon> MadSurge: not that old
<kirzstryfe> 8,6wait, MahBoi777, where in Florida?
<Om> MahBoi777: Oook, havent heard that often
<sagas> Om: Because I could and you seemed like the one who would be most affected by it :D
<alexxm> yeah RaveBrony
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again we haven't had a homemade sunday dinner at my house in years due to lack of time with my parents
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777: Oh, haha. Well hopefully it stays dry for you! :D
<GilDash> I'm back. :)
<MahBoi777> xD
<otakon> wb GilDash
<Meanwhile> Shizuka is like, shy squared.

<RaveBrony> alexxm: Im not sure of the song name :P I know the song from a WoW vd i just watched :D
<LoyalDash> otakon: Oh...>_<

<otakon> Barbetos|AtWork: goddammit that story made me teary eyed
<kirzstryfe> 8,6^5
<MahBoi777> alexxm: what a funny clown
<kirzstryfe> 8,6^2 is too low
*GarrettBrony just wants to be the love you love
*Om quickly hugs GilDash "There, you got your poison. >_> Now stop spaming me with sad flutters"
<otakon> Meanwhile: your moustache is more horrifying.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> You know what? I shouldn't even be talking about. Just not mentioning the title isn't good enough.
<Angel_Espeon> 13YOU'RE weird! ~ :D
<drfsupercenter> 03oh wait, now it's back
<alexxm> thought you'd like that otakon RaveBrony Meanwhile and MahBoi777

<MahBoi777> loved it
<Angel_Espeon> 13I should eat
<Meanwhile> otakon: You want a gif of me doing that instead? I'll put on some clown makeup too.
*GilDash rests head on Om.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> kirzstryfe: you can tell Nittany_Discord that I'm still at it. I'm still causing trouble, even though I know better.
<RaveBrony> alexxm: Youre so thoughtful <3
<GilDash> Om: I needed that. :)
<otakon> Meanwhile: no thanks, I'd like some sleep this month.
<Meanwhile> ^8
<Angel_Espeon> 13my mood is being odd right now
<Om> GilDash: Why. Not feeling well?
<Angel_Espeon> 13TOO LAZY

<Shizuka> 13comes from having bad experience with internet getting personal details
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<GilDash> Om: Dunno. Maybe I'm just overtired.
<Angel_Espeon> 13just remembered we have outdated pasta in the fridge
<Angel_Espeon> 13not sure whether I should eat it or throw it out
*Meanwhile hugs Shizuka.
<Om> GilDash: Hmm. I know how that is.
<alexxm> so what now
<Angel_Espeon> 13SHOULD ANGEL_ESPEON EAT THE PASTA OR THROW IT OUT
<sagas> Saturn: Is your name Andrew by chance?
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Well, I'm not AT IT at it, but I'm talking about that game that I'm not supposed to bug the mods to stream.
<killerpony7733> GilDash i know that feeling too :)
<alexxm> sorry about the clown guys
<Shizuka> 13when the people you spent your emotionally-turbulent senior year of high school with suddenly say "hey is this your phone number can i call you? can i send you something?"
<ZombieGunny> Derpy is NOT amused http://i.imgur.com/6smMQ.gif
<GilDash> Om: Yeah. If I fall asleep on you I'm sorry in advance.
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's pasta salad, chicken and bacon, expired on the last day of May
<MahBoi777> it was a delightful clown alexxm
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Er, every time I try to set things right, I make things worse.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've eaten outdated stuff before, buuuuut I dunno~

<kirzstryfe> 8,6got bored, spammed color :p
<Om> GilDash: I see. The mantinace people woke me up today. -_- I don't know how you are going to force yourself to stay up.
<Wrek> 05no one here has eharded these songs before? :o
<Barbetos|AtWork> I can't say that I have.
<just_me> you can always plug in music and sleep like that :3
<killerpony7733> Om you would be surprised how some people can stay awake
<HyperMetalLugia> version 14 lol
<ACS13123> My stream derped
<Soital> 12ugh thats the one I downloaded
<just_me> or stay awake nvm
<Om> killerpony7733: I know I would.
<Soital> 12hmm okay
<GilDash> Om: I'd say coffee, but I don't want to rely on caffeine. Already had enough of that crap at the festival.
<Soital> 12lets see
<sagas> Shimmer: Are you in New Jersey?
<Shimmer> Nop
<Om> GilDash: Good, its not the best for you anyway
<just_me> i like the music btw :)
<sagas> Shimmer: THis is more difficult
<Iron_Edge> Wrek: I may have, but my memory is about 2 days long -lol- so at times its hard for me to remeber things that dont pose any signifigant change in my life. Ex. Dentist appointment versus watching the season 2 finale. I forgot the dentist apointment..
<GilDash> Om: I usually don't drink it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13try this
<Wrek> 05ok atleast someone here MUST have heard this song before
<Shimmer> sagas: I expected it to be :p
<Angel_Espeon> 13right click on windows live messenger and go to properties
<Angel_Espeon> 13then compatibility
<owlicious> somepony else
<RustyMeat> doesnt ring any bells
<Om> GilDash: Good. You know. You could just go to sleep now. And wake up whenever tomorrow and just sleep a bit more?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nothing for me either.
<just_me> nope
<RainbowJack> i have heard this song befor
<Meanwhile> Well, if one person in the chat has heard this song before, it isn't me.
<Iron_Edge> sadly I cannot recall -lol-
<Angel_Espeon> 13try it on compatibility mode for Windows 98/Windows Me
<GilDash> Om: I can only sleep a maximum of 10 hours at a time... it's really annoying.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't have to use that anymore but I think that's how I originally fixed MSN a few years back when it wouldn't work for ages o.o
<Meanwhile> Hey isn't Alien on later?
<Ninjazz> Least you can sleep. =__=
<killerpony7733> GilDash why? 6_9
<drfsupercenter> 03or just stop being lazy and reinstall Windows already LOL]
<RustyMeat> yes
<Om> GilDash: Just because, or another reason?
<RustyMeat> I believe so
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I don't know. Go ask my body.
<Meanwhile> Score. I love that film.
<Om> Ninjazz: Mr. Insomniac.
<Biglaw|AFK> ohai everypony!
<GilDash> Om: Not really my choice... :S
<Ninjazz> Om: Catchy. ^_^
<RustyMeat> Wait I think they are showing aliens not alien
<Om> GilDash: I read. I can, and have sleapt for 12-14 hours before. Just because.
<Meanwhile> No Aliens is tommorow.

<Meanwhile> This week, Alien, Aliens, and Alien3.
<Invi> wohoo Aliens
<GilDash> Om: If I try to sleep again the best I can do is a sort of trance like state. It really sucks. :D
<Wrek> 05but not alien 4
<Invi> \m/
<Wrek> 05cause alien 4 sucked
<Meanwhile> Wrek: There is no Alien 4. Don't be silly.

<SirGanjalf> D'oh, i missed "Alien":/
<Soital> 12I've deleted chat logs
<Soital> 12but they're backed p on my pendrive
<Barbetos|AtWork> What?
<Om> GilDash: When are you planing on nodding off then?
<Meanwhile> Just like there's no 4th Indiana Jones movie.

<otakon> Wrek: um, you mean Alien Resurrection?
<just_me> what about A v P
<Soital> 12so evenm though I've uninstalled everything
<Soital> 12its still there
<otakon> just_me: suckage, next
<Barbetos|AtWork> AvP does not count
<Meanwhile> otakon: DO NOT SAY IT'S NAME.
<GilDash> Om: In 2 hours or so.
<Alchemist> just_me: no. just...no.
<SirGanjalf> Meanwhile: Exactly
<Invi> just_me taht is a even worse movie
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ridley Scott make that AvP garbage? I don't think so.
<just_me> lol
<otakon> Meanwhile: Alien Resur-shot-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's name.
<Wrek> 05AvP isnt toooooo bad
<owlicious> IT IS NAME!
<just_me> common A v P isnt that bad
<Wrek> 05its neat fight scene action for 1½ hours
<Om> GilDash: That is still an aweful long time to stay awake when you are very tired.
<otakon> Wrek: what about the other one?
<Meanwhile> Not tooooo bad but not as good as any of it's source material.
<Wrek> 05dont expect more of the AvP movies than they really are
<ACS13123> Tell me im not the only one whos like this, but i love to sleep with rain, just so theres a sound to focus on instead off just silence, anyone?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Still though, between Alien or AvP, I would rather watch Alien.
<Wrek> 05as for the predator movies
<Meanwhile> Besides arguably Predator 2.
<Invi> Wrek it is a movie made of cliches. there is no originality in there
<otakon> Meanwhile: agreed, however Predators was fun
<owlicious> wait, what?
<Wrek> 05i kidna liked the latest one
<kirzstryfe> 8,6tonight's movie will be shown at 7pm EDT, about 3 hours from now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek, your right ball drained.
<Meanwhile> ^LOl

<Chrysalis> kirzstryfe what movie is it?
<sagas> Why is there a movie tonight?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Alien
<Meanwhile> sagas: It's trilogy season.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6because we feel like it :p
<sagas> oh yeah trilogy
<GilDash> Om: It's fine if I can find mental stimulation. Talking, walking, etc. Work for example... I'll be falling asleep at my desk tomorrow, I just know it. :S
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: Yaaay...
<Invi> Alien? tonight? I didn't missed it? :)
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: that's his Rage, it powers his special abilities. It'll refill when he goes back into combat.
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: "your right ball drained." really?
<otakon> also, NICE!
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: Some terraria till then? :P
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord.
<owlicious> Really.
<ACS13123> otakon: Same, if itsquiet, i take much longer to fall asleep
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol Nice Alien on tonight. Well I will be on. Is it the directors cut?
<killerpony7733> Om yeah i been in GilDash's position before i kept awake for very long even super tired and i just ended up sleeping in the afternoon

<owlicious> oh, never mind
*Invi pets kirzstryfe ''you do an important job atm''

<owlicious> 7est
<killerpony7733> Om yup
*Shimmer throws a a bag full of dust at Nittany_Discord
<sagas> Meanwhile: The whole movie is a metaphore for rape
<kirzstryfe> 8,6EDT is EST during daylight savings
*Chrysalis dusts Nittany_Discord's clock, its a bit off
<CrazyCherry> kirzstryfe: There, There.
<otakon> Meanwhile: um, have you seen them? Also, the Alien itself. Dat head....O__o

<kirzstryfe> 8,6and 3 hours from now doesn't change based on your time zone :p
<Meanwhile> otakon: I own the directors cut boxset of the Alien films, never question me on the contents.
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I'm literally nocturnal. I easily fall into a wake at sunset, sleep at sunrise, and find it hard to move from that.
<just_me> oh lol
<just_me> nvm
<otakon> just_me: just three hours from now
<HyperMetalLugia> hhisky
<Meanwhile> Alien is on par for my favourite film ever.
<Om> GilDash: Sunlight is very sleep enduceing =_=
<otakon> Meanwhile: makes sense for you
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Ninjazz> You know it, Om.
<Meanwhile> otakon: What're you implying?
*otakon imagines a Xenomorph with a Guy Fawkes mustache "That's you Meanwhile"
<drfsupercenter> 03I could have sworn there was an easy way to get PSN-encrypted videos and stuff to play without actually having the rights to them LOL
<GilDash> Om: ... Look, I don't pretend to know why my body is like it is.
<Om> Ninjazz: I wish I had a big window faceing the sun...
<killerpony7733> GilDash i'm a bit both if i get a bucked up sleeping pattern built up like staying awake during very early morning going to sleep in the afternoon etc
<PrincessLuna> Evening everypony
<Om> GilDash: That wasn't sarcasm :I
<otakon> Meanwhile: mine has got to be Spirited Away
<otakon> hello PrincessLuna
<Invi> i ho PrincessLuna
<Meanwhile> otakon: That'd work except I'm fairly sure none of the xenomorphs exist in a male state.
<Ninjazz> Om: And over the ocean too... that would be one hell of a view.
<owlicious> i liek ponies
<Invi> *hi
<SirGanjalf> evening PrincessLuna
<Om> PrincessLuna: Evening
<MadSurge> otakon: :D what a nice image you gave us
<Ninjazz> Hello PrincessLuna.
<otakon> Meanwhile: um, they're drones
<Om> Ninjazz: Yeah.
<otakon> Meanwhile: well tbh, I always thought the only female was the queen since she's the one that lays the eggs.
*sagas hello PrincessLuna! Hows your day been?
<Meanwhile> otakon: Aliens work like insects, and all an ant hives workers are female.
<sagas> Meanwhile: No all workers are male
<MadSurge> otakon: much like ants, where everyone is a genderless drone except males and queens
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: Evening. ;)
<otakon> Meanwhile: not only that, but the Xenomorphs themselves take on the genetic characteristics of teh organism they infect.
<Meanwhile> That's a fair point otakon.
<Rain> the only one allowed to reproduce is the queen though. that is what you are thinking of, otakon
<otakon> yeah
<PrincessLuna> sagas: Good, I am going out tonight...being treated to dinner and a movie :)
<Meanwhile> otakon: But then queens are born the same way.
<MadSurge> PrincessLuna: Sounds like a perfect night out!
<sagas> PrincessLuna: Oh your lucky! Where are you eating and what movie?
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: Where to, and what to see? Sounds good at any rate.
<otakon> Meanwhile: so if a Xenomorph infected say a Gorilla, it would be different. Like how the Predalien is different then the typical human one and even breeds differently(though completely ineffectively if you think about it)
<Meanwhile> otakon: we're talking gender here.
<XAX> ._. dis Aliens discussion
<PrincessLuna> sagas: Well I think it's an Italian place...sort of small but the food is really good. And I think we are going to see Prometheus
<Invi> otakon i guess it would only work with a queen
<Om> PrincessLuna: Congrats :)
<Meanwhile> Like I said, don't question me on how the aliens work in canonical sense.
<MahBoi777> alienz
<Meanwhile> sagas: And no, we're both wrong. Most worker ants are female with a handful of male drones.
<otakon> Meanwhile: well yeah but I thought I'd bring it up anyway.
<Invi> otakon only a queen would alter the shape and it is much longer in the organism
<sagas> PrincessLuna: Lucky! Hope you enjoy it!
<otakon> Invi: by far
<otakon> GODDAMMIT I CRAVE PIZZA!
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: Sounds wonderful. Hope you have a good night out. :)
<PrincessLuna> GilDash: Thank you :)
<otakon> brb gonna ask Craig if he wants to split a pie
<alexxm> hey PrincessLuna hows your day been
<Meanwhile> Facehuggers mutate into Praetorian facehuggers which can then mutate into a Queen from impregnation in a host.
<PrincessLuna> alexxm: Good, how about yourself?
<alexxm> i'm good PrincessLuna http://i.imgur.com/pYdNB.gif check that gif out
<Meanwhile> And I think the Praetorian alien caste can mutate into a Queen with the absense of one.
<PrincessLuna> alexxm: ...creepy O_o
<Om> I just pulled the elastic string out of me underwear *me gutsa*
<alexxm> yeah it is isn't it PrincessLuna
<Invi> is there actually a Xenomorph-Pony-Crossover?

<Chrysalis> surely it would be Internet + 0(Penis)
<icybeauti> Dethklok is...I don't know if I should say best band ever....
<Meanwhile> Dunno, hate math.
<Lasharus> ...what.
<Chrysalis> which makes no sense

<Angel_Espeon> 13IT'S A THING
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's not going to be very long, seems the rest of the staff got long-winded in covering their stuff and I don't want to have to extend the height of the image a 2nd time
<Om> GilDash: Alright. I wont push it further if you say so.
<icybeauti> Iron_Edge: I saw them live. It was cool eharing him talk there.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Stop implying thing. =__=

<pony_1664> I don't like spiders
<GilDash> Om: Just saying. If you don't really like me acting up then... :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Stop reading into them. ;)
<Om> GilDash: I wouldn't say I hate it.
<Meanwhile> Inb4 5 lines.

<pony_3762> hello everypony
<killerpony7733> Wait isn't the music volbeat?

<killerpony7733> panda lol :D
<Meanwhile> Using /me for colours that is.
<Om> panda: Then stop asking question and get into a kitchen :)
<Shizuka> 13idunno
<MadSurge> icybeauti: I knew it! :D
<Meanwhile> I obviously don't intend to find out because it'd set off a chain.
<panda> Om yes sir:D
<icybeauti> MadSurge: Yeah, I do act girly in ehre lol
<MahBoi777> mmmmmm pumpkins
<panda> Myrei :D hiya
<Myrei> hello

<MadSurge> icybeauti: a girl that watches MLP? MADNESS :D
<MahBoi777> hello Myrei
<Myrei> i feel loved XD
<Om> GilDash: With good reason.
<icybeauti> MadSurge: It is madness. But the ponies are amazing.....
<Shizuka> 13SuperZuro64: Change your nick and do not impersonate mods.
<Shizuka> 13You have ten seconds.
<Myrei> me?
<panda> Shizuka readies her ban hammer
<Myrei> im impersonating a mod? O_o
<panda> Kirz xD dat message?
<MadSurge> icybeauti: Indeed. Btw, who's your favorite?
<MahBoi777> no not u Myrei
<GilDash> Om: Yep. You're never quite straight with me, are you? :D
<icybeauti> MadSurge: Rarity
<Wrek> 05no Myrei, read the name in the beginnign of the message
<Meanwhile> Dat kick message.
<Myrei> oh <_<
<Myrei> im clueless
<Ninjazz> icybeauti: Good choice! :)
<panda> Lil_B :D
<Om> GilDash: I am as crooked as a snake in a rock tumbler.
<Wrek> 05"untill the fillies round up at me"
<sagas> Guys, ive found out so much about Saturn on the internet, im kinda scared
<Lil_B> panda HWAT?! how did <ou see me?
<icybeauti> How do you impersonate a mod? You can tell who they are by the colored text....
<MadSurge> icybeauti: used to hate her, but her hammy moments are hilarious :D
<ACS13123> Goodbye people
<panda> Lil_b im psychic :D
<alexxm> bye ACS13123
<Saturn> 08,01decisions, decisions
<Om> panda: Yet you cant make a good sandwich -_-
<sagas> Saturn!
<icybeauti> MadSurge: I love the whole fashion thing she has and she acts like me. Afraid to get dirty and all that.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i need your opinions on something
<panda> Om :( im doing it now
*Lil_B is scared of panda
<panda> Saturn yes?
<GilDash> Om: That's so crooked I don't even know where to start. :D
<Saturn> 08,01i'm look at postgraduate study programmes
<icybeauti> Go ahead Saturn
<sagas> I was intrigued by your talk of internet privacy and decided to go full stalker on you
<Om> GilDash: I thought it was a good analogy.
<panda> Saturn ok....
<Saturn> 08,01and i really want to be involved in education, particularly computer science education
<sagas> Saturn
<panda> Madsurge you crash?
<icybeauti> Saturn Teach little kids. Don't teach middle or high school or you'll hate your job.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm really interested in the way programming is taught in to kids
<MadSurge> icybeauti: chat derped, what was your last message?
<panda> Saturn ^-^ it suits you :3
<Saturn> 08,01and how we can get schools to churn out more competent programmers
<icybeauti> MadSurge: I said she acts a lot like me. She's into fashion the way I am and hates classless people. Plus, I freak out when I get dirty like her lol.
*Shizuka 13hopes saturn isn't talking about american schooling cause that's a lost cause
<GilDash> Saturn: I'd say go for what you want. That way you'll always (hopefully) end up with qualifications that suit what you'd like to do.
<Saturn> 08,01and how to invent programming languages that facilitate an easier way of creating programs, but for beginners and professionals
<icybeauti> I with Shizuka on this one.
<panda> Saturn well, you cant really "churn" out more compitent kids. If you force it on them... they will refuse
<Meanwhile> American education, oxymoron amiright.
<pony_1664> lol
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: i know that, let me explain the problem
<Wrek> 05actualyl make BASIC fun saturn?
<panda> Icybeauti omg... i think i love you
<Om> GilDash: So hasty.
<Lil_B> Saturn hat would be interresting.. the only things kids learn in school about PCs is how to operate WORD, I would so like to learn how to write simple programms or tasks myself
<panda> Wrek but i thought basic was fun :m
*icybeauti glomps panda
<Saturn> 08,01panda: that's not what i mean; maybe it was a bad way of putting it. the way programming and computer science is currently taught in schools is beyond bad.
<MadSurge> icybeauti: Well I try to be at least decently classy, unless I really know people and start jokingly act sloppy and stupid :D
<sagas> Saturn: Ive gone full internet stalker on you and now im afraid how much a person can find about another on the internet
<Shizuka> 13stalking is bad mmkay?
<Wrek> 05ok
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<MahBoi777> :D
<Wrek> 05wish me luck
<alexxm> how do they teach it now Saturn
<GilDash> Om: Brain =/= functioning tonight, okay? :D
<icybeauti> A lot of people I know from my grade don't have any manners. I really hate when people don't have manners.
<Meanwhile> Break a leg Wrek.
<sagas> I just did it because i was bored
<BlazeAngel> I am back bronystate! And I have brought tons of jimmys for Wrek to Rustle!
<Om> GilDash: I think its functioning just fine
<panda> Saturn agreed, but how do you put it on kids when, at that age, they are worrying about other things. You would have to make sure that it stays as an elective otherwise you will get a crapload of uninterested students :(
<Saturn> 08,01i mean that after having studied computer science at school, and i'm adament that it should be called that at school (and that there should be a subject specifically for comptuer science), a child should be able to go on to a university course and not forget everything he was taught in school
<icybeauti> alexxm: Let me explain: THIS IS A MOUSE! THIS IS THE SCREEN! YOU CLICK LIKE THIS!
<Saturn> 08,01which is largely the case now
<alexxm> hey BlazeAngel what have you been up to
<MadSurge> icybeauti: how so? Disrespect for other people or filthyness? :D
<alexxm> icybeauti oh yeah thats bad
<Saturn> 08,01panda: i'm saying it should be just as important as physics or chemistry, which are also electives at most school
<sagas> Andrew Bell
<Saturn> 08,01yes?
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(MysticLugia03)02WB* - <MysticLugia> 12And even with help, I am yet not able to get that what I want
<Saturn> 08,01that's me
<icybeauti> MadSurge: Disrespect mostly. I heard there were kdis picking on a special ed kid the other day.
<otakon> DUN DUN DUUN!
<sagas> Im scared how much ive been able to learn about you
<Shizuka> 13saturn might be okay with it, but i'm not
<Saturn> 08,01bet you don't know my middle name
<otakon> so, WHO is that?
<otakon> oh it's Diablo
<Shizuka> 13don't be spreading personal information here
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: i'm pretty open
<MadSurge> icybeauti: :O no respect for such assholes.
<sagas> ive noticed
<otakon> no it's not
<BlazeAngel> Everyone! I am looking (or at least hoping) for a minecraft buddy or crew! Seriously, Im getting bored as buck spending the nights in my ass-looking wooden house alone. Anyone?
<panda> Saturn: i agree that it should be up there, since in my opinion, programming is a science.
<sagas> also, you have a pretty dog and cat Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: the cat's dead now, unfortunately
<otakon> a'wwww
<panda> Blazeangel, im down but... i have a cracked minecraft :(
<MegaMoonShine> Saturn: :'( How?
<Shizuka> 13sagas: Again, Saturn may be okay with it, I am not. Stop spreading personal information.
<sagas> awww now you made me sad :'(
<alexxm> what happened to it Saturn
<icybeauti> MadSurge: I know! When I heard this, I was about to cry and was so pissed.
<Meanwhile> Is it me or is that boss dropping corpses?
<otakon> Meanwhile: well he IS the Lord of Hell
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: discuss this with me in private if you want
<MahBoi777> sagas: don't be sad, get glad
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: i'd love to know wha tyou found
<Meanwhile> otakon: Still, corpse bombs? I saw enough of those in Warcraft 3.
<MadSurge> icybeauti: my fav(s) is Pinkie/Fluttershy btw.
<sagas> okay
<panda> Shizuka, define personal info :3
<BlazeAngel> Saturn, will you join my minecrat crew? Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees? *AppleBloom brunch face*
<icybeauti> sagas: Listen to smile smile smile if you're feelign down.
<otakon> Meanwhile: it IS Blizzard
<otakon> and COME ON I CALL HACKS!
<Saturn> 08,01BlazeAngel: no time, unfortunately
<Meanwhile> otakon: Whelps.
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, as i was saying
<BlazeAngel> Saturn: Jah, tis be okay
<alexxm> what is it with blizzard and weaponized corpses
<Saturn> 08,01i have a number of choices right now
<icybeauti> MadSurge: I love fluttershy a lot. Ever since I read cupcakes though, my view changed a little for pinkie though...
<otakon> all those damage damage fields taking up 90% of the battlefield
<otakon> it's bull
<MadSurge> icybeauti: and that would have made me actually angry, while I usually have a ton of patience.
<pony_1664> Why is that demon fat? I would think they would work out for a job like this
<Saturn> 08,01one option would be to get a Teaching Diploma and become a teacher
<BlazeAngel> icybeauti: Wanna come play Minecraft with me? :3
<Saturn> 08,01i'd do that for a while, being on the front lines as it were
<Saturn> 08,01get some real experience with it
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, this isn't very well paid
<panda> Teaching credentials on top of your programing degree saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01panda: computer science, but yes
<Shizuka> 13on top of his license to kill
<Om> oh my
<otakon> Shizuka: how about a license to be silly?
<otakon> NO BUFFER!
<Om> otakon: REVOKED!
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: What about a licence to ponehs? :3
<MegaMoonShine> pony_1664: Work out for dropping bodies and making circles on the ground? Doesn't sound like a LOT of work
<Meanwhile> otakon: Forever buffering.
<Shizuka> 13you can't license silly
<Shizuka> 13that would be..
*Shizuka 13lowers her glasses
<icybeauti> BlazeAngel: I don't have mindcraft, sorry :(
<Shizuka> 13silly
<otakon> Shizuka: silly....DAMMIT
<Shakaran> http://puu.sh/AieG
<Om> classes r hawt
<otakon> Shakaran: Mr. Waternoose REALLY let himself go
<MegaMoonShine> Shakaran: Cannot unsee
<panda> Saturn, hm... well... not sure what to say :/ if its not something high paid, but you enjoy it, i say you go for it :3
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka, do you have the computer game by the name of minecraft? :3
<alexxm> Shakaran so thats what happened after the film mr waternose became the king of hell
<otakon> yAY THEY WON!
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<otakon> and then Lea became evil
<otakon> I'm calling it
<otakon> someone goes evil
<Meanwhile> otakon: inb4 it's you.
<Saturn> 08,01but, then again, i'm not sure how beneficial that'd be to my goals
<BlazeAngel> otakon: Is it Lea?
<otakon> Meanwhile: nah, it's your Moustache
<Saturn> 08,01another option is to do a Masters in Education
<otakon> BlazeAngel: I almost guarantee it
<icybeauti> Saturn If it's your cutie mark, go for it
<Saturn> 08,01then maybe a PhD in Education
<Meanwhile> otakon: what, not the rest of me as well?
<Shakaran> backpack so organised
<otakon> Meanwhile: it's just so fiendishly magnificent.
<BlazeAngel> Meanwhile: No, only an evil moostache.
<Saturn> 08,01but then, what i *could* do is become a teacher, then do a Masters in Education part time
<panda> Doctor saturn, sounds awesome :3
<Saturn> 08,01that'd be 2 or 3 years
<Shizuka> 13BlazeAngel: never heard of it, is it new?
<icybeauti> The dr......Grab a TARDIS and star traveling...
<Saturn> 08,01then after that, do a PhD full time
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, thinking about it, that's a really good option
<Ray> 02Nini everyone~
<Viri> 14night :3
<Lil_B> Saturn I just thought a little bit more about teaching more computer sience in schools... I think that there are multile Problems that are coming together
<Saturn> 08,01then again, i don't know if i want to do a Masters in Education or Comptuer Science, to be honest
<Cypresswolf> Oh no :S
<otakon> wait... Tyriel?
<otakon> this is NOT gonna be good
<icybeauti> Choices choices choices....
<Chrysalis> Saturn ill warn you, a Masters is REALLY damn hard
<alexxm> this can only end well
<otakon> it's NEVER this simple when it comes to Diablo
<Cypresswolf> I got a jury duty summons - july 3
<Shakaran> oh snap what a twist
<otakon> I KNEW IT!
<Meanwhile> Oh hey look otakon you were right.
<Rain> Wrek, your music is going well with my game of Uncharted 3 :3
<Chrysalis> hell, final year BSc is easy in comparison
<icybeauti> Cypresswolf: -hugs- Dawwwww
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: better read The Runaway Jury then
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: Oh no, its not at all new, but its a great game. No steam, but its great. Its currently 15 euros, (whatever that is in crazy american currency) And is all about building stuff, and surviving againsted skeletons, zombies, and worst off all... *shudders* Creepers...
<Om> No no, I am sure its fine.
<Saturn> 08,01though really, maybe what i'd do is a Teaching Diploma, then work as a teacher for 3 years while doing a part-time masters in Education, then a full time CS PhD in programming language design
<otakon> wait.... AIDAN was the dark wanderer?
<Shizuka> 13BlazeAngel: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
<Saturn> 08,01actually, that's a really good plan, i think
<Chrysalis> language design?
<Shakaran> what difficulty is this?
<killerpony7733> otakon yes
<otakon> GODDAMMIT I KNEW IT
<otakon> NO BUFFER NOT NOW!
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: I'll go with plan B - answer the question in a way they wont pick me :P
<xxMoopyxx> whats up every pony
<Meanwhile> Oh dear.
<MegaMoonShine> That's not true! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
<otakon> welp, poor Lea
<alexxm> hey xxMoopyxx hows your day been
<Shizuka> 13BlazeAngel: http://youtu.be/B8A01RmPAxg of course i know minecraft
<MegaMoonShine> And hi xxMoopyxx
<Meanwhile> The designate.
<pony_1664> oh uncle deckard
<otakon> she's been corrupted
*BlazeAngel explodes
<xxMoopyxx> good i stayed up late last night
<Lil_B> Saturn Not enough competent teachers, not enough time to teach everything effectivly and I think right now, programming or the better understanding of PC is seen by most Schools (and Companys) as unneccesary
<otakon> STUPID BUFFER
<Meanwhile> Why's she talk to herself.
<Cypresswolf> My 3rd summons in 4 years, I only had to sit on the bench in 1/2 so far
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: *explodes*
<kirzstryfe> Shizuka, stop teasing the poor guy :p
<Chrysalis> dat lack of colour!
<Shizuka> 13awwwww
<alexxm> i assume what just happened isn't good
<icybeauti> Dude, your color....
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: A lot of characters do that
<Om> White and black
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: The point is, wanna play it? Good one, ;)
<Chrysalis> also, Shizuka just got a load of subscriptions probably
<icybeauti> He is now a regular jackoff like us
<MahBoi777> Black and White
<Meanwhile> MegaMoonShine: True. Talking to the audience rather than themselves really.
<Shizuka> 13eenope
<panda> Saturn so... have you decided what you will do?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6she is quite sneaky about that
<Shizuka> 1344 subscribers, but they're months old now
<Om> MahBoi777: Raceist.
<Chrysalis> man mouse smoothing is Sooo annoying
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: I have the same problem :D
<Saturn> 08,01panda: i think so
<Chrysalis> well, i just subscribed
<kirzstryfe> 8,6quick, everyone go sub to her channel so she feels obligated to create :3
<BlazeAngel> Shizuka: Shizuka?
<MahBoi777> Om: wut, Black and White sounds better, HOW is that racist?
<panda> Saturn oh? Tell me tell me tell me :3
<MegaMoonShine> Meanwhile: I talk to myself a lot and it's kinda annoying
<Jim> But I already have..
<Meanwhile> MegaMoonShine: Ikr.
<GilDash> Om: It's alphabetical. :)
<icybeauti> MahBoi777: That's reverse racism
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i think you're right that they see it as unnecessary, but as the world changes over to our generation, this will change
<panda> Shizuka wehn i get back on the comp ill sub you okies?
<Om> GilDash: I knew you would say that.
<BlazeAngel> I haz subsribez to Shizuka!
<Saturn> 08,01because computers are the world now
<MahBoi777> icybeauti: I don't see color
<Saturn> 08,01put it this way: there's a reason that computing is one of the highest paid professions
<Om> MahBoi777: I just like calling everything raceist. And watching people stutter
<GilDash> Om: Why me specifically? :D
*Rain was subbed to Shizuka before it was cool
<Shizuka> 13my youtube subscribers will be disappointed, won't be another video for a long time
<icybeauti> MahBoi777: Sounds better
<Saturn> 08,01everyone needs peopel who know about computers now
<MahBoi777> Om: ah I see
<Wrek> 05uhm
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Rain is so hipster :p
<Saturn> 08,01even in minor senses
<Wrek> 05how to start cinematics?
*Meanwhile was subscribed to Shizuka before it was... Oh damnit Rain.
<Om> GilDash: You are a writer, and I know you to some degree
<Shizuka> 13rain rain <33
<Rain> EAT IT, Meanwhile! >:D
<Meanwhile> Om nom.
<icybeauti> Since we are in a fast pace technology era, we need to learn about computers in a more educational light.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<GilDash> Saturn: When computers are involved in nearly everything in everyday life, I can understand why.
<Rain> <3 Shizuka <3
<Shakaran> go to login screen i think
<GilDash> Om: A writer who doesn't write, and not as well as you'd think. :)
<Meanwhile> Rain: Tastes like defeat. ;n;
<Shizuka> 13a writer who doesn't write?
<Jim> The cinematics in this game are so awesome
<Shizuka> 13sounds like me..
<Rain> >:3
<BlazeAngel> Sing with me everypony! Ouga chacka ouga ouga ouga chacka! (dont leave me hangin')
<Chrysalis> Saturn it can be annoying at the level they "need" people with computers
<icybeauti> Shizuka Funny, I'm writting now...
<RaveBrony> hey, can somepony help me out with some TF2 stuff?
<Om> GilDash: But you still value some degree of orgonization.
<MahBoi777> ouyga ouga whatta whatta
<Saturn> 08,01panda: teaching diploma -> work as a teacher for 2 years while doing a part-time Masters in Education -> work a further 2 or 3 years as a teacher, maybe dabble in education politics -> do full time PhD in CS relating to programming languages
<MahBoi777> ?
<Chrysalis> my latest fix to a problem, was to uncheck a box that someone had checked because "shouldnt you always check the boxes"
<Jim> What tf2 stuff, RaveBrony ?
<GilDash> Shizuka: Let's form a club. Bonus points if you haven't read in years either.
<Shizuka> 13nope i've read, i've read a lot
<RaveBrony> Jim: Some questions, lol.
<icybeauti> I lvoe readins.
<Wrek> 05gah this annoys me
<Shakaran> wrek u have to log out to watch winematics
<Jim> I might be able to help you
<GilDash> Om: Ideally yes, but I've not the effort to bother with it normally.
<BlazeAngel> GilDash: Dude.... your reading now. *facehoof*
<kirzstryfe> 8,6wait, so you have to be logged in to do everything in d3 except watch the movies?
<RaveBrony> Jim: One, do your weapons harm teammates?
<GilDash> BlazeAngel: I mean novels and the like. Haven't read one in 3 years now... that's actually really depressing. :(
<panda> Saturn :) sounds good ^-^ im debating if i should get teching credentials with my degree
<Jim> RaveBrony: Nope.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6bliz is win :\
<BlazeAngel> GilDash: It is, actually. :(
<Om> GilDash: Alright. And its sad to hear that.
<Wrek> 05ok so sicne i cant fidn hwo to play it in game
<RaveBrony> Jim: Ok, cool. and 2, do you know the pony server? (Or even better - is there a 'random join' button or something?
<Wrek> 05ill play it via youtube
<icybeauti> I try to get a new book every time I finish one.
<GilDash> Om: Can I have another hug? :(
<Shakaran> LOG OUT TO WATCH CINEMATICS
<Om> GilDash: They arent candy -_-
<BlazeAngel> Hey, uh, GilDash? Wanna play minecraft? :)
<panda> Gildash, read a book! Read a mother buckin book!
<Saturn> 08,01panda: what are you studying?
<BlazeAngel> panda: Good reference.
<GilDash> BlazeAngel: Don't have a good enough PC for that. :(
<panda> Saturn psychology :3
<Jim> oh this awesome cutscene

<panda> Blazeangel thank you ^-^
<Meanwhile> Nice halo.
<MahBoi777> whoa
<alexxm> i'm studying media right now
<Chrysalis> you study psychology... at what level?

<Chains> hi CCCP
<RyunosukeKnT> hey cccp
<alexxm> hey CCCP what have you been up to
<MysticLugia> 12USJ?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
*drfsupercenter is watching Code Geass
<MysticLugia> 12lawl
<Chains> No no no I stole his name for a sec
<drfsupercenter> 03just started season 2
<Saturn> 08,01fork() and exec() is a retarded way of goign about spawning processes
<panda> Chains stop chaning your name to cccp and vice versa :D you aren fooling anyone xD
<MadSurge> Birthdays? YAY :$
<Chains> Mine
<Om> GilDash: I Like the uniquness of each individual.
<RaveBrony> Wrek: Alrighty then, ill catch you sometime later this week i suppose :P
<panda> Saturn well exec is good but fork? XD
*GilDash nods at Saturn, then pauses and shrugs.
<Chrysalis> Meh, i like fork
<MysticLugia> 12ah
*BlazeAngel sings
<Chrysalis> get to fork all the programs
<GilDash> Om: I'll believe that when I see it. :)
*MysticLugia had serious talking with parents about.. stuff
<Chains> UM
*CupcakeWarrior glomps VioletVanilla
<Chains> Discord is here...
<coyboy> it was good alexxm until I discovered for the first time ever today the cupcakes video :(
*alexxm hugs coyboy
<Chains> At the bottom of the user list
<Saturn> 08,01panda: if you don't fork(), what process exec()s?
*VioletVanila hugs CupcakeWarrior
<Om> GilDash: You rely on your sight to much it would seem :)
<icybeauti> Volbeat is best rockabilly band.
<killerpony7733> Om I agree but people are to some point losing uniqueness over time atleast in my eyes
<Saturn> 08,01instead of fork(), there should be something like emptyprocess()
<CupcakeWarrior> Volbeat the band>Volbeat the pokemon
<panda> Saturn i dunno xD but i know exec is short for execute right?
<Om> killerpony7733: Look deeper.
<GilDash> Om: I'm nocturnal, which means lot of darkness. So no, hearing, smell and tactile takes a lot of work too.
<Saturn> 08,01does the same thing, but has an implicit exec()
<Saturn> 08,01and blocks until it can exec()
<Chains> I think I'm getting my rule books mixed up, is roleplaying allowed?
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Im a little behind on my forks and execs.....give me the slow pony version of it -lol-
<Saturn> 08,01or spawnprocess() would be a better name
<Wrek> 05aaand im done
<icybeauti> They should make a special room just for roleplaying.
<killerpony7733> Whos streaming next?
<Chains> YEAH
<Jim> There is a rule against excesive roleplaying Chains
<panda> Saturn hm... so it leaves the process idle? And spawnprocess would be alot to type no?
<Iron_Edge> Thank you sir for the stream Wrek <3
<Om> GilDash: Oh yes, I forgot how releven primary senses are when you use sight in a metaphof.
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: fork() duplicates the currect process, copies the memory, and retains all open file pointers
<Om> metaphor*
<killerpony7733> icebeauti that would be good
<Chains> Excessive? I can deal with that.
<otakon> night Wrek thanks again
<RyunosukeKnT> o/ wrek :)
<Yokupony|Bananas> awww I missed Wrek's stream :(
<icybeauti> I just came up with that :)
<Meanwhile> Thanks for streaming Wrek.
<MadSurge> Enjoy your documentary Wrek!
<Michael> Gnight Wrek
<MegaMoonShine> Bai Wrek
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Ok now I see. But whats an excecs then?
<icybeauti> Yeah Wrek, it was great. Later!
<Jim> enjoy your show Wrek
<Saturn> 08,01Iron_Edge: exec() executes a new program, overwriting the current process
<Chains> GoodbyeWrekHaveANiceDay:)
<Rain> lol, Chains, learn to spacebar :p
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Ahhhhh....so simple now. Thank you kindly good sir.
<GilDash> Om: I bridge things too easily for my own good. :)
<killerpony7733> Saturn any idea whos next to stream? 6_9
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: Have some wubs <3
<Jim> How do I spacebar?
<Meanwhile> One does not simply space into words.
<Saturn> 08,01so the convention to spawn a new program is that you fork() your current program, then detect whether you're in the parent or the child. if you're in the child, you exec()
<Chains> LearnToWhat?IDon'tKnowWhat"Spacebar"Is.O_o
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: no idea
<killerpony7733> Saturn ok D:
<Om> GilDash: I think it might be somthing you learned to to for your own good. As a result of something that you lacked in a particular time.
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Wrek
<panda> Saturn, needless to say im confused. If it has to override a process why should it matter if one is parent or child?
<GilDash> Om: I won't even begin to debate how that might not be the case...
<Chains> I have to pee!
<Meanwhile> Congratulations.
<MahBoi777> >.>
<Om> GilDash: But you want to.
<VioletVanila> 06An empty stream? (;
<mzp> how many of you guys enjoyed the symphonic metal I requested last night? btw I'm metalzeldapony
<Meanwhile> Dat auto kick.
<Jim> Indeed it is empty
<killerpony7733> VioletVanila yup
<GilDash> Om: I hate those kinds of debates. They never lead anywhere good.
<icybeauti> What debates?
<VioletVanilla> 06Saturn y yu kick me? ):
*Chains is reading the rules. "What counts as a non-image link?"
<Meanwhile> ViVi is a silly filly.
<Om> GilDash: When have I ever lead to something good anyway? Hmm?
<panda> Violetvanilla it was sumica :D
<VioletVanilla> 06Youtube videos, such as those~
<Saturn> 08,01panda: because the code is the same in both. the object of it all is to spawn a child process. say you're the bash process, and you want to execute ls as a child process, with the same stdout and stdin as you're using
<Meanwhile> Chains: A link that isn't purely an image.
<Meanwhile> A duuuuuuur.
<Chains> A gif?
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol- :D you just troll kicked Violet.
<Michael> Chains: videos or fanfictions
<GilDash> Om: You'd be surprised. :)
<Chains> A song?
<panda> Saturn so the parent would be overridden?
<Meanwhile> Chains: gif counts as an image.
<OmNom> Hello
<Om> GilDash: I would. But not tonight, as you are.
<Meanwhile> It's really a common sense thing.
<Saturn> 08,01you fork() to create a new bash, which maintains your currently open stdout and stdin in the child
<panda> Hi omnom aka chains :D
<MahBoi777> hello OmNom
<Saturn> 08,01but you want the child to be ls
<Michael> hai OmNom
<OmNom> panda stfu
<panda> Omnom :D why!
<Saturn> 08,01so you exec(ls), which overrides the code and data in the child with the ls process that's beign started
<MegaMoonShine> Hi OmNom
<Chrysalis> Saturn enjoy the locks in that state :P
<GilDash> Om: I nearly never get surprised, Om. :)
<OmNom> I see a person named Om...?
<Om> Great. Now I'm guna get fake pinged more -_-
<panda> Saturn, i see.... wait can i ask you something?
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: that's exactly my point!
<Saturn> 08,01panda: sure
<Saturn> 08,01it's a stupi way of doing it
<Saturn> 08,01why copy your process, when you're just going to override it anyway...

<GilDash> Irish_Pony: Sounds like a bad story there... :(
<Meanwhile> Wow that sounds really depressing.

<MadSurge> :D I recognize this one too
<Dark_of_Max> hi guys
<VioletVanila> 06This ist the remix I did~

<Om> GilDash: That sounds bad.
<Espeon> 06Also Aurora does the forums lie or is your birthday today (for me living in the future, from 25 minutes ago) ? :P
<GilDash> Om: Well, it's not good! I seriously thought I saw a zombie at one point. :D
<Aurora> 6tomorrow

<Drake> 04goddamnit I keep getting confused between Aurora/Espeon and Feather/Skylands
<Aurora> 6oh hey, reversing numbers
*Vordox notices the chat went silent to listen to the song.
<MahBoi777> ahhhh silence
<Om> GilDash: You did. It was yu xD
<|Discord|> Silence you say? KZIJMFDKVM
<GilDash> Om: Not in the middle of the road, Om... :|

<Feather> 10so HAH
<Om> GilDash: detailssss
<Aurora> 6I used to have teal
<Aurora> 6but changed since a lot of people had it
<GilDash> Om: Even worse when you consider we were on the *motorway* where there are no people on the road.
<Espeon> 06It's pretty much illegal for me to not have this text color when I have this name.
<Aurora> 6and then all of a sudden people are purple
<Feather> 10WAIT IT'S AURORA'S BIRTHDAY TOMORROW
<Espeon> 06I used to teal toooo so yeah
<Aurora> 6BUT ANYWAYS thanks espeon
<Aurora> 6yeah it is feather

<MahBoi777> hhehe
*MadSurge has not an OC but still dances
<FillyFlam> Can't dance, doing ratamacues.
<GilDash> Om: Nah, in Britain it's illegal for people to be on Motorways. Makes sense, seeming as the limit is 70mph and there's a no stop policy.
*Vordox tries to get the party starting with trying to nudge ponies to the dance floor. "Piiinkiieeee, start em up!"
*kirzstryfe dances in the VIP Mod-only room :p

<Drake> 04Be grateful.
<SilverSonic> Happy Birthday Aurora!!

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Whiskra: Yes
<everfreenights> fluttershy approves of this movie aparrantly
<Sentry> cool
<Colt_of_Personalty> this is the original Whiskra
<Sumica> 00,10Fluttershy does not beling in this movie.
<ROHKARA> I thought most people like to stop the Alien series at Aliens, not Alien 3
<Calcos323> Stream is a bit laggy for me
<Sumica> 00,10George taki would be ok though
<RivaLz> Original like "uncut"?
<Bronysith> Sumica: fluttershy belongs in every movie
<Sentry> weresm\ mah xeno morphs
<TwistedFury> yay?
<Midnight_Fyre> I never noticed the dipping birds in the intro before
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I probably shouldn't be saying anything while the guy who proudly has me on ignore is on.
<TwistedFury> yay
<TwistedFury> Yay

<RustyMeat> Hey guys I just tuned in what did I miss?
<Colt_of_Personalty> My friend posted his baby's ultrasound picture on Facebook the other day, and i left a picture of H.G. Giger's original alien art in the comments. Told him it'll probably grow outta that phase
<everfreenights> #rainbowdash
<Calcos323> RustyMeat: Not much

<everfreenights> spaaaaace
<Steel_Thunder13> I wanna see Prometheus
<BroKnee> Ty :3
<Vordox> O.o
*Canadian_Brony pulls up a recliner
<Calcos323> This is the second scariest movie ever made
<cordovan_splotch> Me too.
<Midnight_Fyre> Made in 1979. Better special effects than movies today
<Fleta> Howdy Bronystate :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01 Sound is off.
<Steel_Thunder13> wich is the first calcos?
<Obsidian> Calcos323: First?
<DocSane> Evening, everyone.
<Canadian_Brony> Calcos323 whats the first?

<Randomnerd> Are you an alien?
<Obsidian> Hi DocSane
<Canadian_Brony> hi Docsane
<BroKnee> Hello Fleta :3
<DocSane> Nice to see you all enjoying the classics.
<Calcos323> Obsidian: Haven't decided yet
<Michael> hai DocSane
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Fleta and DocSane
<cordovan_splotch> I've heard bad things about it, but I want to watch it anyway.
<Shizuka> 13is that an alien?
<Randomnerd> Son, you gota condition.
<Shizuka> 13is that an alien?
<Steel_Thunder13> The Thing can be kinda scary
<Randomnerd> no.
<Steel_Thunder13> the original one. not the POS remake
<DocSane> beep beep beep chucka chucka chucka
<Tovler> I wish I was that dark /me goes tanning
<Vordox> Shizuka: Is that Tim Allen?
<Obsidian> Shizuka: To them, WE are the ALiens.
<everfreenights> wow, it has been sooooooooo long since I was on bronystate, did they ever watch castle in the sky here??
<ChaoMing> PROTIP: The room is an alien
<Calcos323> Obsidian: Possibly The Exorcist
<RustyMeat> pretty lights
<cordovan_splotch> Lyra's rubber ducky is an alien chestburster.
<TrixieBaconMuffin> and suddenly im reminded of Darkstar
<|Discord|> Tat room confuzzels me
<Tovler> Over 10 megabytes of memory.
<DocSane> He is using a computer in the COMPUTER ROOM
<Midnight_Fyre> Steel_Thunder: I thought the only thing The Thing had going for it was the special effects. I thought the rest of it was pretty ridiculous
<Shamroc> THE MATRIX..
<Meanwhile> No Shizuka mayonnaise is not an alien.
<Michael> so much buttons
<Shamroc> oh wait nvm
<Sentry> not me
<Randomnerd> Dat freudian stuff.
<Steel_Thunder13> dem computers from the future
<ChaoMing> Why are we running Winux 1995?
<Sentry> what do they do
<Fleta> How come we don't have computer rigs like this?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Shamroc
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: im a the?
<FillyFlam> What a story mother~
<Steel_Thunder13> just install linux
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<DocSane> God, I love the set designs on this movie
<Steel_Thunder13> instant aliens computer
<Randomnerd> What's the story, morning glory?
<otakon> YES I'M BACK IN TIME!
<Midnight_Fyre> In 30 years from now they will look back at what we imagine futuristic computers to be like in movies and laugh at us
<Michael> Wb otakon
<Sentry> what do they do
<otakon> VioletVanila: sorry I missed the rest of your show though
<Canadian_Brony> welcome otakon
<Sentry> metal gear
<Obsidian> WB otakon
<otakon> it's the Prometheus!
<Nyria> otakon: You should have gone back in time farther~!
<ChaoMing> DERELICT SPACE STATION, BETTER DOCK ANYWAYS
<otakon> hiya Nyria
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I missed VioletVanila's stream. I am sad :<
<Fleta> It's Red Dwarf
<Nyria> Hey otakon ^^
<DocSane> This was the first R-rated movie I ever saw in the theaters.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I missed most of it too :(
<Tovler> VioletVanila: came back?
<Sentry> this i R?
<Sentry> cool
<Nyria> I R this~
<Canadian_Brony> Fleta no, that was british and funny
<Losttimes> O hai black guy who is going to die
<Darf14> I almost forgot about Aliens :)
<Randomnerd> Losttimes: He doesn't die first!
<otakon> and the black guy dies first trope DIES in this movie
<Nyria> What a twist~
<Sumica> 00,10this is the first one Alien.
<Fleta> Canadian_Brony : Looks like they need Lister and the Cat :D
<Tovler> depends, was this movie made in the 70s?
<Obsidian> Yay for averted tropes
<RivaLz> no he dont die first, actually he is pretty kewl
<otakon> Sumica: yes it is and I haven't seen this in AGES
<ChaoMing> SPACE Transmissions
<otakon> RivaLz: indeed
<Sinestro> what year did this come out again?
<DocSane> 1979
<Sentry> 2000 i think
<Darf14> Somewhere in the 79's
<Canadian_Brony> Fleta they have a cat . . . wait, what am I saying? This is Alien, not Red Dwarf! Get with the program, silly filly!
<panda> Otakon pm me please
<otakon> Darf14: in the late 70's
<Nyria> Indoor voice~
<otakon> also, this movie STILL LOOKS GOOD
<Fleta> Know-it-all androids >,>
<DocSane> Anyone here who HASN'T seen this before?
<Randomnerd> Stupid freaking contract.
<Sentry> 2000 i think
<ChaoMing> I have not
<Colt_of_Personalty> I haven't seen it
<otakon> it looks better than MOST movies do nowadays
<Darf14> Ush I hit the 9 by accident ?\>_<
*Nittany_Discord 11,01shares
<ChaoMing> But...
<otakon> Darf14: lol
<ChaoMing> SPACE contracts
<Michael> who in here has bever seen this movie yet?
<Midnight_Fyre> contract=death
<Obsidian> I have never seen it all the way through
<Darf14> .....sigh *facehoof*
<Sumica> 00,10some how they turnd off the sound of the computers
<Calcos323> Sumica: Is anyone gonna show The Lord of the Rings trilogy?
<pony_1350> where is steel thunder?
<Nyria> Is it me or does this look way better than Avatar?~
<otakon> Michael: I've seen it but it was YEARS ago
<Losttimes> Then suddenly HALE 9000
<Diglett> What did i miss
<otakon> Nyria: it's not just you, it still looks good
<Randomnerd> To be fair, though, I believe sailors are obligated to render assistance unless they themselves would be put in peril.
<ChaoMing> Eh, Avatar had faster fluidity, this is more suspenseful
<Sumica> 00,10that is the end of the event Calcos323
<Midnight_Fyre> Nyria: it certainly looks more real
<Michael> i think everyone has seen this movie :D
<StinkomanFan> I hated Avatar
<DocSane> Randomnerd: Yes, they are. International maritime law
<Darf14> Which one?
<Diglett> witch 1
<Fleta> ChaoMing : with SPACE clauses that screw engineers out of their hard earned SPACE DOLLARS $$
<StinkomanFan> once you get past the cat people it's just boring
<Calcos323> Sumica: KICKASS! Will it be the extended edition?
<Michael> alien, this movie
<Sumica> 00,10ofcorse,
<Midnight_Fyre> I though Avatar was pretty average. Entertaining, but average
<Diglett> what did i miss
<ChaoMing> SPACE Dollars, the best kind of currency for SPACE
<Calcos323> Sumica, you've just made my night
<Michael> Diglett: nothing interesting
<Diglett> cool
<Sumica> 00,10keep in mind that's not till august though
<DocSane> Man, I keep forgetting how small LV-426 is.
<ChaoMing> as long as Avatar was, it still felt like there were holes and that it was a bit rushed
<FillyFlam> Avatar was pretty but had kind of a weak plot in retrospect.
<Obsidian> Diglett: It just started so not much
<Nerom> Avatar was boss in cinemas but on a tv it was crappy
<Calcos323> Don't care, Sumica, it gives me something to look forward to
<Shizuka> 13but it had robot knife fights
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica so, what else are you showing? Will there be a list on the newsletter?
<Midnight_Fyre> Nerom: exactly
<DocSane> Cue the vector graphics...
<Fleta> So is the last movie of this trilogy Alien 3 or Alien Resurrection?
<ChaoMing> Aww
<Calcos323> Fleta: 3
<Canadian_Brony> Fleta Alien 3. THERE WERE ONLY 3!!!
<ChaoMing> I was expecting a hyperspace jump thingy from Star Wars
<Midnight_Fyre> Fleta: should be Promethius
<Sumica> 00,10this weeks news letter will list next weeks trilogy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alien 3.
<Darf14> Resurrection doesnt exist >_<
<Sinestro> 3, Resurrection never happened
<Tovler> Avatar looks really weird at 60 fps.
<Canadian_Brony> thx Sumica
<Colt_of_Personalty> Seapony Lyra playing with a rubber ducky TOTALLY adds to the tention of the movie
<Midnight_Fyre> Darf14: neither does Alien 3
<Losttimes> Fleta: We don't talk about resurrection around here
<ROHKARA> I heard that most people stop at the second movie
<Chrysalis> Sumica so no valve stuff will ever appear then?
<Fleta> Lol, I didn't like Alien 3 but loved Alien Resurrection. Weird I know, but I also watch MLP too :D
<Sinestro> its a good stopping point anyway
<Sumica> 00,10Resarection never happend
<Canadian_Brony> Colt_of_Personality welcome to BronyState
<Randomnerd> So that's the Nostromo, yes?
<DocSane> Just watch the first two movies and forget that anything else was ever made.
<Randomnerd> Just the little part?
<Midnight_Fyre> Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, and the AvP movies do not exist
<Shizuka> 13wasn't that the guy that predicted stuff?
<ChaoMing> I find it hilarious that most spaceship engines you see are just lights instead of actual pyrotechnics
<Sinestro> like Pretator 1 was the only good one
<Darf14> Sadly the first Aliens movie I ever saw was Ressurrection and I hated it
<Michael> the best movie from alien is alien 2, in my opinion
<Randomnerd> Shizuka: Nostradamus
<Nerom> I think i have not seen ressurection
<Fleta> They did a barrel roll -shot-
<Michael> is the most i liked it
<Midnight_Fyre> Nerom: spare yourself
<Sinestro> yeah, call me uncultured but Alien is 80% buildup
<Shizuka> 13Randomnerd: no no that was the ship in Alien
<Randomnerd> Nostromo is a reference to Joseph Conrad
<Diglett> they press r twice
<Canadian_Brony> Michael I've only seen Alien, but that was years ago
<Sumica> 00,10fire tends to melt the models ChaoMing
<ChaoMing> That is true
<Whiskra> for some reason, channels absolutely LOVE to air Alien Ressurection rather than any of the first 3
<Randomnerd> Shizuka: lol
<Diglett> little
<Nerom> Is it the one where they clone that woman with the alien?
<Randomnerd> I walked into that one...
<Michael> Canadian_Brony: it's a great movie :S
*Shizuka 13is operating on only like three brain cells else there would have been a longer chain of puns there
<Fleta> Nerom : Yup
<Michael> :~$
<Darf14> Good old Vector Computer Graphics, surely this is the future:)
<DocSane> Activate Christmas lights...
<Michael> :P
<Sumica> 00,10demn navigation christmass lights
<Michael> lol
<Michael> call santa
<Diglett> Look at them buttons
<RivaLz> xDDDD :D
<Calcos323> Am I the only one that keeps confusing the words Sumica and Shizuka?
<Nerom> Fleta: I quite like that one. and I have never seen this one before
<Tovler> needs more busy talk.
<DocSane> I still think vector graphics look like The Future(TM)
<Calcos323> Nerom, you're in for a treat
<ChaoMing> Hmm, them landing a spaceship reminds me of the time I landed planes perfectly in Wings of Prey
<Sumica> 00,10Most confuse the genders too Calcos323
<Obsidian> Remember This is suppose to take place AFTER Prometheus
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka you remind me of me when it's 5:30 in the morning and I'm staring at the Food Network clutching a 2 litre of Pepsi. Good times . ..
<Diglett> why does the future have somany buttons
<Shizuka> 13how do you confuse us.... one of us types in a pretty pastel color, and the other streams anime from time to time
<Losttimes> Looks like Santa got a bigger sled
<Calcos323> lol
<Fleta> Nerom, then we're like the only 2 in the world who did like it :(
<BlueFlare> 02[16:29] <SilverSonic> So I bought Skyward Sword today!
<BlueFlare> 02Nice!
<Calcos323> No, I mean just the words, not the people
<RivaLz> And this is how Santa delivers presents to all kids and ppl on world, he uses an Spaceship with Christmas Lights...
<Darf14> We installed christmas lights because we wanted to pimp our ship
<DocSane> Oh my God, a giant rock!
<otakon> Shizuka: so, you stream anime right :3
<Michael> space tuning
<otakon> OH NO!
<Whiskra> shit what a crash!
<Sumica> 00,10great landing
<ChaoMing> derp, lets just ram the ship into the ground
*Shizuka 13waits for that to go over everyones heads
<Darf14> Painc!
<Diglett> what about the button
<kirzstryfe> 8,6don't confuse their genders, Sumica is female and Shizuka is a robot
<otakon> lol
<Michael> go panic
<Calcos323> 10 point landing
<Nerom> Lol Fleta It was good not just as good as the others I have seen
<Michael> nuuuuuuuuu
<Litwick> Why a straight answer? Why not a homosexual answer?
<Darf14> I give that landing a 2 /10
<ChaoMing> SPACE collisions
<Nerom> Still I liked it
<Sumica> 00,10did they land on a spike?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And kirzstryfe has tasty colors.
<Canadian_Brony> kirzstryfe that explains alot . . .
<ChaoMing> seems like it
<Litwick> *rimshot*
<otakon> Pinkie "Would anyone care to join me in panicking? No, okay! ....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!"
<Calcos323> THEY LANDED ON SPIKE?!?
<FillyFlam> Litwick: Or an answer that's mostly straight but experimented in college?
<Calcos323> HOW COULD THEY
<DocSane> So much damage from landing on a friggin' rock.
<Sumica> 00,10re rout all ducks
<Canadian_Brony> Calcos323 my thoughts exactly
<RivaLz> 9/10 but only because of the lighting effects and these fire sparkles :D
<ChaoMing> REROUT THE AIR DUCTS
<ChaoMing> wat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, crappy landing.
<Obsidian> Dat Technobabble
<otakon> Calcos323: naw, they landed on Henry, Tom's 2nd cousin
<ChaoMing> reroute*?
<Shizuka> 13better than landing on planet bob
<Fleta> otakon : The ducts need rerouting? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Tovler> in the future, wind chimes still exist
<Whiskra> in the future, you can hardly hear what the other guy says on the phone while on an uncharted planet
<Losttimes> Look at all the flashing lights, that means the ship is broken
<Diglett> why do they use aol
<Sumica> 00,10beats my mun landing
<otakon> Fleta: use duct tape! and they need MOAR RAILINGS!
<DocSane> Land on creepy planet, create instant haunted house.
<ChaoMing> @Diglett, they're not
<otakon> WHERE ARE THE RAILINGS!?
<Canadian_Brony> just patch it up with Duct Tape. It'll be fine
<ChaoMing> That's using Windux 95
<ChaoMing> They're*
<Shizuka> 13no duct tape on mars
<Diglett> oh
<Sumica> 00,10nah win 3.1
<otakon> Shizuka: how about WD 40?
<Obsidian> Duct tape for Ducts. Makes Sense
<Colt_of_Personalty> In space, nopony can hear you order duct tape
<ChaoMing> Nah, Windows has a user-friendly interface
<Shizuka> 13they forgot how to make it
<ChaoMing> linux/unix does not
<ChaoMing> so, combine the two
<ChaoMing> c:
<Darf14> The ship need railings installed to prevent another crash
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka this is Mars?
<Fleta> 2000 meters? We can use the SPACE CAMARO!!!
<Sumica> 00,10matrix beta
<RivaLz> I doubt they have MS DOS or something
<Diglett> Matrix
<Shizuka> 13sure, don't you see the demons?
<ChaoMing> HE CAN READ THE MATRIX NUMBERS
<Losttimes> Run the debug program
<Darf14> Hes the chosen one! :O
<Calcos323> This is The Matrix before The Matrix was The Matrix
<ChaoMing> try @echo off del "System32.exe"
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka . . . now I'm really lost
<ChaoMing> :P
<Obsidian> Yellow Matrix > Green Matrix
<Michael> he can see the matrix
<Shizuka> 13don't worry, i have no brainpower tonight
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka who would have guessed
<ChaoMing> dat shake
<Steel_Thunder13> spoiler: he can read the matrix because he is neo
<Diglett> Space
<dalekkahn> Yellow matrix is the only weakness of the green matrix
<Michael> let's go spaceeeeeeeeee
<Diglett> spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccccceeeeeeee
<Losttimes> Michael: SPACCCCCCCCCCCE
<Canadian_Brony> dalekkahn reminds me of the Green Lantern somehow
<BlueFlare> 02I think I played it too fast though
<Whiskra> the only complaint I have about this movie really is that it takes a bit too long for the alien to show up
<Midnight_Fyre> Space is fun
<Steel_Thunder13> gptta gp tp s[ace
<Michael> SPACEEEEEEEEEEEE
*Fleta sings "it's a beautiful day in the universe, a solar eruption would make it worse"
<ChaoMing> SPACE ELEVATORS
<RivaLz> Holy shit i knew it was a bad idea turning my headphones extra loud
<Sumica> 00,10but this is not space
<dalekkahn> Real spoiler: He can read the matrix because he is an agent
<pony_5393> I dont know a single name of a single pony
<Steel_Thunder13> gotta go to space
<Sumica> 00,10they landed
<BlueFlare> 02Now I'm stuck waiting for the next Zelda game :/
<owlicious> TO THE EARTH!
<ChaoMing> They're in astronaut suits, so lets just consider them in space still
<Diglett> the xenomorph has landed
<dalekkahn> Suddenly LUNA
<ChaoMing> GOOD SPACE CONTACT
<Calcos323> They're no where near the moon, though
<BlueFlare> 02fun game to replay though
*Tovler is geeky enough to know that operators read Matrix code.
<Michael> this is not the moon :(
<Sumica> 00,10axe you
<RivaLz> Im afraid they wont meet Luna there since theyre not on the moon :(
<Diglett> I dont think there on the moon
<ChaoMing> lol Sumica
<RivaLz> But they meet Chrysalis sooN!
<Calcos323> Dat Sigourney Weaver
<FillyFlam> Dat foreshadowing
<Calcos323> Dat dat
<SilverSonic> im taking my time with this
<RustyMeat> lol
<ChaoMing> Space fuck offs
<Michael> nope, changeling
<Distortion> he'll die first
<Diglett> dont complain or the facehuggers will hug you
<SilverSonic> I already know that LL is gonna keep pushing me to finish this game XD
<Darf14> Ok theres three units on the ground, Ill position this unit over there whi- .... ugh ive been playing too much Xcom >_<
<dalekkahn> In space, no one can hear you make stupid remarks
<Obsidian> Distortion: Ohi Bro
<Canadian_Brony> what, is swearing obsolete in the future or something?
<Distortion> Dat dat creates reality paradox
<SilverSonic> most likely it will take me along time X3
<Tovler> being a douche to a woman in a slasher movie. that's a good sign.
<ChaoMing> no, they said "fu*k"
<Michael> dat suits
<Fleta> dalekkahn, but they can hear you gripe...
<ChaoMing> ASCII code
<Diglett> binar
<Colt_of_Personalty> As long as nobody has sex, they might have a chance
<Sumica> 00,10kitty
<DocSane> Ripley can apparently read binary.

<otakon> Sumica: PLEASE DON'T JINX IT
<otakon> hiya Paladin_Drakkenwolf
<DocSane> Aliens was pretty cool for realizing that video screens would be 16:9
<FillyFlam> Sumica: In the future, Mips runs all video.
<Phase4> 00,02i think i read about this movie
<ChaoMing> I hope they have some Marauders in their unit composition

<otakon> LOOK AT THE CHEST!
<Sumica> 00,10big dude
<Midnight_Fyre> Practical effects are so much cooler than CGI
<otakon> LOOK AT THE CHEST!
<Darf14> .....Aliens
<Sumica> 00,10it's a Zentradi
<dalekkahn> Just to clarify for everyone this is NOT the same alien ship as in prometheus
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: so agreed
<Canadian_Brony> that is a life form?
<Fleta> MAN, will you look at the Lazy Boy!
<Distortion> How many of you saw Prometheus and are depressed on how it connected to none of this?
<otakon> dalekkahn: well that sucks
<ChaoMing> how can something be fossilized without being pressurized and fertilized?
<owlicious> it's a skeleton
<StinkomanFan> KA-BOOM
<DocSane> Some of us haven;t seen it yet, so please don't talk about it.
<Obsidian> Phase4: I predict they will have 2 sequels before the first Alien
<dalekkahn> Same type of ship though. Same aliens
<Darf14> I wonder if he exploded twice
<Phase4> 00,02ah, k
<Sumica> 00,10might have had presure before it landed
<Canadian_Brony> Distortion that makes me very angry. I didn't watch it, but if it has nothing to do with this . . . ugh
<RivaLz> So a Alien...killed by and Alien?
<Kerzaped> ChaoMing: magic
<RivaLz> an*
<ChaoMing> SPACE magic
<otakon> ChaoMing: dry rot really, plus the Space Jockey was from the looks of things had a exoskeleton
<Canadian_Brony> RivaLZ seems legit
<otakon> dat face
<Kerzaped> your right\
<Shizuka> 13space jockey..?
<Fleta> What's more amazing than finding an alien corpse? A hole in the floor.
<Kerzaped> she looks bored
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> omg a giant hole
<otakon> Shizuka: not THAT kind of jockey
<Sumica> 00,10"it's a warning"
<Shizuka> 13it floats around giggling until it finds a ship to attach to?
<otakon> THEN HEED IT!
<StinkomanFan> When dealing with HR Geiger is one of the few times you can actually use the term Mind Rape litterally
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Dunnnn
<ChaoMing> One does not simply fossilize without being surrounded by carbon, space is not carbon-based :|
<owlicious> SHOO BEE DOO... oh, this is space
<otakon> Shizuka: no, that's the other thing in this movie
<BlazeAngel> CALL UPON THE SPACE PONYS!
<Sumica> 00,10ChaoMing who said the ship has no air?
<Shizuka> 13those are just headcrabs
<Shizuka> 13applied directly to the forehead
<Obsidian> owlicious: Call upon the "space" ponies?
<otakon> ChaoMing: well, the equivalent of fossilizing in a no atmosphere environment
<otakon> brb
<ChaoMing> Hmm, I see your point
<otakon> yeah, a cave in a SHIP
<Canadian_Brony> SPAAAAAAACE(!!!) ponies
<Darf14> I think there origional mission was to find the space core, but instead they found a ship
<DocSane> otakon: So, they said fossilized when they meant dessicated.
<Litwick> 030
<ChaoMing> but they're in a spaceship, it has to have an atmosphere
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Sanctum
<Michael> seems legit
<otakon> DocSane: I think so
<Fleta> But it's a dry heat! << Aliens reference :D
<ChaoMing> else they'll be forced to be in astronaut mode the entire time they're there
<otakon> DocSane: but that's kind of the same thing
<otakon> Fleta: yeah, you want that after you live in Florida.
<StinkomanFan> ChoaMing, the MOON has an atmosphere but we can't breath in there either!
<Kerzaped> Dagerous air
<otakon> brb

<Calcos323> Bad sign #1

<ChaoMing> They're not on the moon, and they're in a spaceship/space station
<ChaoMing> ;)

<sagas> Panda: Just.... No.... Its a Lyra plushie with a built-it hole in the back made for a penis
<HyperMetalLugia> nice
<Cypresswolf|SCP-2012> Rainbow Dash looks quite pale O_o
<sagas> Toots!
<Drake|Work> It's mostly chilled. The guy I'm with is just staying at the office waiting for a job, so I'm allowed on my computer until we go out again.
<Airpuff> sagas: omg that thing -.-
<RustyMeat> Am I gonna have to link to the plush again?
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm going to get paid for my summer placement work thingie
<Drake|Work> Hell, he's even playing Sniper Elite V2 while we wait :P
<sagas> Airpuff: Yes.... That thing....
<Airpuff> do it :D
<Drake|Work> Lucky, I'm not getting paid :<
*Tov|YoutubeMechanic finally googles Lyra Plushie
<derpyyyy> Its not for a penis
<Panda> sagas: what?
<Dark92Enigma> AND ALL OF A SUDDEN........AWESOME MUSIC
<Drake|Work> Granted, it's not real "work" anyway
<derpyyyy> There slippers silly filly
<RustyMeat> I got kicked last time for linking it
<Airpuff> really derpyyy ? looooool
<RustyMeat> I wonder why
<Airpuff> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, I'm doing my thing for a month
<Skylands> 10Drake, do you want to go into IT or something?
<Pinkies4thWall> Dark92Enigma: just click the link?
<Tov|YoutubeMechanic> oh that is awesome. I want one
<sagas> Panda: I just told you. Its a Lyra plushie with a hole in its butt that the creator intended for a penis
<derpyyy> that or mittens
<HyperMetalLugia> mon-fri, 9-3:30
<ponibas> wtf?? oO
<sagas> damn...
<|Discord|> Art contest? Sounds fun
<Pinkies4thWall> NO SAGAS NO
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/CrAMN.jpg
<derpyyy> IT IS NOT FOR A PENIS
<Derp1999> this game looks familiar. what's it called?
<drfsupercenter> 03Playing Pokémon Pinball on a PS3
<Panda> sagas: but why...
<Irish_Pony> WHOA!
<DuskStarshimmer> debug, red faction blankety blank
<drfsupercenter> 03that game looks awful on large screens
<HyperMetalLugia> hax
<Tov|YoutubeMechanic> It's for your golf clubs
<HyperMetalLugia> nonono
<HyperMetalLugia> Play it on
<HyperMetalLugia> Gameboy player GC
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<DuskStarshimmer> Derp1999, red faction blankety blank
<drfsupercenter> 03>PS3
<sagas> Panda: He was a troll and he did it to anger bronies and make them look like perverts
<Cypresswolf|SCP-2012> Nothing in this fandom should give me nightmares - but then again, I have already read [REDACTED]
<ponibas> friendly fire!
<drfsupercenter> 03I have my GameCube at home
<HyperMetalLugia> nice santa
<drfsupercenter> 03I really just want to make the most of this thing
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a 32GB flash drive
<Dark92Enigma> Pinkies4thWall For a second, i thought it was the actual background song for the playthrough! LOL
<Drake|Work> @Skylands maybe, but I've a lot to learn about the industry first before I make a decision.
<drfsupercenter> 03that I did my PS3 game backup on
<sagas> Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: Cupcakes?
<Derp1999> DuskStarshimmer, thanks.
<RustyMeat> The funny thing is that he offered to remove the hole if the buyer requested it
<Om> Panda: The creator hates bronies.
<Barbetos> So was Mr. Toots a dlc thing or was it apart of the game from the begining? That would be pretty awesome considering this game came out June 2010, a few months before g4.
<derpyyy> actually i saw a review he was apparently not even a clopper..
<junh1024-XD> oidrf do you still have your 4.11 PS3?
<Panda> sagas: and someone actually bought it
<derpyyy> It sold for like 600
<Om> Panda: Just ask Saturn
<sagas> Panda: I think so
<Panda> Om: :(
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, I'm going to be working in a pretty professional environment, so I'm happy
<Tov|YoutubeMechanic> A pokemon fan made that plushie? I'm so proud
<derpyyy> i think they bought it to be funny
<BlueFlare> 02I'm going into IT
<drfsupercenter> 03junh1024-XD, I sent it to Light_Latias
<drfsupercenter> 03why?
<Cypresswolf|SCP-2012> sagas: That info was supposed to be classified - You know too much :O
<Nerom> Magnet gun is best gun
<Derp1999> :O
<Skylands> 10Everyone wants to
<Om> Panda: Its a good story, Saturn talked to the guy.
<Skylands> 10lolredundant
<Panda> sagas: wow... so... it was meant to troll bronies?
<Timpony> Hi Everypony
<sagas> Panda: Saturn is the foremost authority on that plushie
<Dark92Enigma> Tov|YoutubeMechanic: Which plushie?
<drfsupercenter> 03IT is awesome, that's why
<BlueFlare> 02^
<Panda> Saturn: um... may i know the story?
<Pinkies4thWall> PLEASE stop the talk of the plush. I already have nightmares
<sagas> Panda: He knows the most
<junh1024-XD> lol
<Irish_Pony> fail
<Panda> sagas: :D
<Airpuff> that plushie is terrible -.-
<junh1024-XD> ppl on wcd might want one to rip SACDs
<sagas> Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: Its not that bad. I enjoyed it
<derpyyy> sexy nightmares?
<BlueFlare> 02I might look into a job like Network admin or something
<Skylands> 10Or because all of us are people with no lives who use the computer all the time
<Tov|YoutubeMechanic> The Lyra Plushie comes with pants. Its no white dove but it still looks good.
<junh1024-XD> ^
<Om> Airpuff: That plushie was probably baught by a brony that will use it for different purposes
<ponibas> are you making things implode
<Drake|Work> Skylands that's pretty much it XD
<ponibas> ?
<sagas> Magnets - How do they work?
<Nerom> Like I said sumica Magnwt gun is best gun
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Tov|YoutubeMechanic
<derpyyy> i want it for gloves.
<Drake|Work> Besides, apparently IT jobs pay pretty well.
<Stallion_of_War> Vat game is this?
<Skylands> 10Not in America
*sagas dusts Nittany_Discord "You always get so dirty..."
<junh1024-XD> some
<Panda> sagas: ok... look... if i didnt know of the hole and that the creator was a anti brony, i would have bought it
<DuskStarshimmer> Stallion_of_War, Red faction gurrilla
<Stallion_of_War> VioletVanila: YOU'RE HERE!
<drfsupercenter> 03<junh1024-XD> ppl on wcd might want one to rip SACDs <- how do you rip SACDs on 4.11?
<junh1024-XD> IT is a very broad field
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Skylands> 10IT is like, just a bit higher than working in fast food or grocery
<junh1024-XD> can it run unsigned packages?
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<drfsupercenter> 03you need CFW
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Hugs
<BlueFlare> 02eh, they make the most money in America
<Timpony> Hi Everypony
<derpyyyy> Tacos
<Pinkies4thWall> o hi VioletVanila
<Stallion_of_War> Wow internet lag
<junh1024-XD> so MFW didn't work?
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<Drake|Work> h-uh
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Vivi
<Skylands> 10BlueFlare, "they" who?
<Randomnerd> Hm.
<junh1024-XD> programming jobs play higher?
<drfsupercenter> 03PS3MFW requires the keys
<sagas> Panda: Yeah but the creator stated pretty explicitly what its intended purpose for in its description
<drfsupercenter> 03same keys that sacd-ripper needs
<Skylands> 10Jun, yes
<BlueFlare> 02people who work in IT
<junh1024-XD> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03the reason 3.55 is the higest CFW
*Stallion_of_War gives Vivi a million wub points
<Skylands> 10BlueFlare
<drfsupercenter> 03is because 3.55 is the highest with leaked keys
<Skylands> 10that's not true
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone leaked 4.11 keys, we could make 4.11 CFW
<drfsupercenter> 03I made my own 3.55CFW earlier, so yeah
<Panda> sagas: who reads descriptions :D
<Skylands> 10stop pretending like you know what you are talking about :P
<Pinkies4thWall> this gun is epic
<otakon> Stallion_of_War: no, she deserves a BILLION
<Barbetos> Stallion_of_War your going to crash the wub market if you keep doing that.
<Drake|Work> o-o
<Drake|Work> Do you?
<BlueFlare> 02Skylands, I'm in school for IT
<BlueFlare> 02>.>
<Airpuff> Stallion_of_War: million..?!
<junh1024-XD> dentists and actuaries should make lots of money, too
<sagas> Magnets are fun
<Skylands> 10IT does not make the highest wage or salary
<Airpuff> sagas: indeed :D
<Stallion_of_War> Airpuff: By comparision, you get two
<Om> Huh...
<Om> That was weird
<Airpuff> Stallion_of_War: ...
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, stuff like software development makes more
<Skylands> 10I'll be using Jun's example
<Skylands> 10Dentists make WAY more than a basic IT employee
<Stallion_of_War> Mear mortals can't handle that much wubs
<Pinkies4thWall> DUDE
<Drake|Work> well duh
<Marx> Ooh.
<Drake|Work> They're dentists.
<sagas> Yay for breaking the laws of entropy!
<Tov|YoutubeMechanic> I'd turn my lyra plushie into a way I can put chalk on my pool cue.
<otakon> Stallion_of_War: she is no mear mortal!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sagas: I know.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01shakes off dust
<Skylands> 10I'm telling BlueFlare because he thinks IT makes the most
<Stallion_of_War> otakon: I know, that's why she can handle a million wub points
<BlueFlare> 02IT makes about $20,000 - $150,000/year depending on the job.
<BlueFlare> 02It’s a VERY broad category
<Pinkies4thWall> Dat plan
<Om> All the power in the house shut off, except for the one with the internet connected.
<Drake|Work> "Broad" doesn't mean "rich"
<sagas> Stallion_of_War: Are we talking vinyl scratch wubs or <3 wubs?
<junh1024-XD> the thing is, noone wants to be dentists, 'cuz customers don't like you
<Skylands> 10^
<Drake|Work> and IT itself is very broad
<Airpuff> Om: lol.. must be fate
<sagas> Om: What great luck!
<Stallion_of_War> sagas: both?
<Randomnerd> I thought they were the same?
<BlueFlare> 02LOL. That's what I mean Drake
<Drake|Work> There's programmers, network admins, computer repairmen.
<Om> I know.
<junh1024-XD> dentists also have one of the highest su*cide rates, apparently
<sagas> Stallion_of_War: I can accept that
<junh1024-XD> S&D
<Stallion_of_War> Vivi is sleeping?
<junh1024-XD> actuaries are highly skilled in both maths & calc
<sagas> Om: Now you have an excuse to wast time on the internet!
<junh1024-XD> err
<Randomnerd> Mawwiage: Twoo wub
<Skylands> 10My dentist is an old guy
<junh1024-XD> stats & calc
<otakon> brb guys
<Drake|Work> Hell, people in software tend to make more money than people in hardware, but I think people in hardware have a more reliable income.
<Om> Oh, it came back.
<Pinkies4thWall> BOOM
<JRP2234[iPhone]> d:
<Randomnerd> It *is* late in her part of the world.
<sagas> okay otakon we will miss you
<Om> What a strange thing
<junh1024-XD> possiblt
<BlueFlare> 02Okay, let me ask you something Skylands
<BlueFlare> 02do you know what IT stands for?
<Stallion_of_War> Vivi also gets 20% extra wubs on everything because of her beautiful voice
<Marx> That repair ability is pretty cool.
<junh1024-XD> inb4 it's renamed to ICT
<nickstr> what I am doing is somewhat IT related
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: how much environment is destructable in this game?
<JRP2234[iPhone]> Om it just means ur power is being gay and shiitty
<sagas> Because FUCK entropy...
<Om> Yup. Apartments are great
<Drake|Work> Information Technology.
<Drake|Work> :D
<BlueFlare> 02Information Technology yep
<DuskStarshimmer> Entropy? LOL im pinkie pie
