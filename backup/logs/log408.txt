<drf|laptop> 03This is like
<drf|laptop> 03one of the best quotes I have ever seen
<drf|laptop> 03<Casey8> Diana Ross' husband died
<drf|laptop> 03<Tarrier> how
<drf|laptop> 03<Casey8> fell while climbing in South Africa or something
<drf|laptop> 03<JennAway> that's sad
<drf|laptop> 03<Bubbaprog> i guess there is a mountain high enough
<drf|laptop> 03I've been quoting that IRL and forgot where it came from, but there it is
<Rukario> 2 pages x-x
<SilverSonic> and someone misread my tweet as (Full House) of the Dead. *late*
<SilverSonic> stupid mIRC froze
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03Full House is a stupid show, so I would love to see a Full House of the Dead
<drf|laptop> 03it might be more entertaining if I got to shoot Bob Sagat or whatever his name is
<drf|laptop> 03:D
<SilverSonic> Bob Saget as a zombie.
<drf|laptop> 03exactly.
<SilverSonic> =win
<drf|laptop> 03I'd play that.
<SilverSonic> someone thought it'd be a great future version of the sitcom
<SilverSonic> XD
<drf|laptop> 03<Fraeon> I have found an awesome reason to become emo
<drf|laptop> 03<Fraeon> You can celebrate all those days you weren't born instead of that one day you were
<HyperMetalLugia> funny windows, very funny.
<HyperMetalLugia> For some reason, when I did a repair on my 7 partition, my Documents folder become a system folder and was hidden
<HyperMetalLugia> fixed it though, whee
<HyperMetalLugia> First time that has ever happened to me too
<drf|laptop> 03<truefalse> I was at the bus stop and saw a poster of Voldemort with 'HP 7' printed on it.
<drf|laptop> 03<truefalse> Kind of spoils the ending when you know he's low on hit points.
<HyperMetalLugia> how many horcruxes were there?
<HyperMetalLugia> :V
<drf|laptop> 03over 9000?
<drf|laptop> 03<Algorithms> I bet you could pay a person from india to act as an IRC bot for you, for less than a shell account to run an eggdrop.

<Drake> 04Still mad at me NS?
<Iago> I'm okay
<Iago> thanks for asking
<Drake> 04:/
<Iago> oh yeah Drake
<Drake> 04?
<Iago> I got an A-A+ for my short story
<Iago> about Rhy/Nathan/Leonard
<Iago> had some punctuality errors
<Drake> 04Oh nice
<Drake> 04Can I read it?
<Iago> didn't
<Iago> I already give it to you?
<Iago> It's the one where Rhy hides in the cupboard
<Iago> and bawwwwwws
<Drake> 04Oh
<Drake> 04that one yeah
<Iago> yeah
<Iago> Wasn't even that good
<Drake> 04It was profound. Which doesn't really suit your writing style IMO
<Iago> hah
<Iago> what context of profound do you mean in this case, Drake?
<Iago> Intelligent or descriptive?
<Drake> 04Intelligent
<Iago> oh thanks, Drake
<Drake> 04XD
<Iago> that makes me feel awesome
<Iago> good to know my usual writing style isn't intelligent
<Drake> 04You know I'm here to please you

<Drake> 04hey Presea
<Iago> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Iago> etc.
*Iago slaps Drake
*Drake dodges
<Iago> what do you mean by "profound. Which doesn't really suit your writing style"
<Iago> ):
<Kenji> hi
<Iago> ohai
<Drake> 04like
<Drake> 04you seemed to be going for a more emotional reaction. In your usualy writing (ergo Reminiscence) you're blunt and tell it like it is.
<Drake> 04Hey NS
<Drake> 04You know that thing
<Drake> 04on TST
<Iago> Ah
<Drake> 04the "TST Couples" topic?
<Iago> oh yeah
<Drake> 04Can we end that thing
<Iago> I don't think anyone really cares
<Drake> 04because it gets annoying everytime we bring up couples in the chat and I have to pretend to like you and I can't say who I actually have a crush on
*Drake hides
<Iago> and it's kinda awkward to say "hey guys, we decided we don't like each other anymore"
<Drake> 04fair enough
*Iago stabs Drake
<Iago> XD
*Drake teleports
<Iago> well, people actually say that?
<Kenji> orly
<Drake> 04not much anymore
<Drake> 04but suddenly the TST couples topic was revived by Rocket Ninetails so I thought it was a good chance to make Arti take that down
<Kenji> heh
<Iago> hah
<Iago> well
<Kenji> hmm don't remember the last time i logged in
<Iago> I'm too tired to decide this week
<Kenji> to those forums
<Drake> 04This week
<Iago> and I can't access most sites anyway
<Iago> >DER laptop
<Drake> 04Your laziness is truly glorious NS- oh
<Iago> only reason I'm on mIRC on the DER laptop
<Iago> is because safe mode
<Iago> I'm also running PuTTy and VNC
<Iago> fun
*Iago is awesome
<Drake> 04yikes
*Kenji high fives Iago
*Iago ^5s too
<Iago> I also have a theory
<Iago> that a portable version of firefox
<Iago> will get around the bluecoat proxy
<Iago> seeing as it only seems to affect IE
<Iago> but
<Iago> that could easily just be port 443/80
<Iago> actually
<Iago> it is
<Iago> theoretically a proxy should bypass that
<Iago> but it doesn't seem to work
<Iago> so
<Iago> maybe it'll work on firefox
<Iago> and IE is gay anyway
<Drake> 04o-o
<Iago> I'm just having issues downloading firefox
<Iago> because blocked sites
<Iago> and proxy is being derpy
<Drake> 04the webquest we had to do during AH today wouldn't work on Firefox
<Drake> 04so I had to use IE ;_;
<Iago> Ah
<Iago> ._.
<Iago> I miss using linux
<Iago> windows is so slow
<Drake> 04XD
<Iago> but I can tolerate it
<Iago> because yeah
<Iago> >DER laptops
<Iago> >finding workarounds
<Iago> :D
<Iago> only thing I don't like about safe mode
<Espeon> bbl!
<Drake> 04Whenever you type DER laptops
<Espeon> sorry for being all not here and such:<
<Iago> is the fact that I can't seem to access google
<Iago> at all
<Drake> 04I actually think of you saying "DERR!"
<Iago> which sucks
<Drake> 04Bye Espeon
<Iago> hah
<Iago> seeya Xeli
<Iago> but yeah Drake
<Iago> seriously though
<Iago> I can write in most styles
<Iago> I just choose to write things in different ways
<Drake> 04But you don't usually.
<Iago> Reminiscence is a completely different style to that fic I wrote for english
<Iago> because one, that fic needed to be profound
<Iago> for marks
<Iago> and two, Reminiscence is more about action
<Iago> and reminiscing, thus the name
<Iago> and philosophies
<Iago> it'd be weird in that fic's style
<Drake> 04I named the first chapter of DoI "Reminiscence" because it's the only thing that fit that wasn't obscenely long.
<Iago> Ah
<Drake> 04It was originally "You're not much of a Femme Fatale" but that's too long and doesn't really suit it.
<Iago> hah
<Iago> well
<Iago> Reminiscence does need more description and detail tbh
<Iago> most of it makes me cringe
<Iago> it's not the sort of fic that really shows what's happening
<Iago> but rather describes and /almost/ tells but not quite
<Drake> 04hurr
<Drake> 04The problem with me
<Drake> 04is that I don't really have a writing style yet
<Iago> I shift writing styles depending on the occasion
<Iago> I can write in almost any style
<Drake> 04I try and fit as many descriptive words in as I can, so when it's mostly speech (which it is rather often) it feels bare.
<Iago> and obviously I'm better at some than others
<Iago> I suck at starting and ending
<Drake> 04And the use of adjectives isn't always good
<Iago> my endings often feel rushed
<Iago> and my beginnings can feel a bit unanswered as well
<Iago> and yeah
<Iago> speech is bare
<Iago> unless you do it well
<Iago> apparently I did it quite well in the Rhy cupboard fic
<Drake> 04I do it poorly.
<Drake> 04at least IMO
<Iago> but that's because Rhy was being a whiny bitchy kid in a tantrum
<Iago> and that's easy to write
<Drake> 04Can I give you a piece of a chapter and have you tell me what you think?
<Iago> yeah
<Drake> 04one sec
<Iago> do hurry
<Iago> I haven't showered
<Iago> I still need to play piano
<Iago> aaaaaaaand you smell like 1 2
<Drake> 04:<
<Iago> okay nevermind that line
<Iago> but uh
<Drake> 04wait what
<Iago> I need to sleep early
<Iago> I'm exhausted
<Drake> 04yeah you do
<Iago> And I need to get up at 5:15am tomorrow
<Iago> cus' band
<Iago> and the day after
<Iago> and I have a maths common test on friday
<Iago> soooooooooooooooooooo
<Iago> I'm screwed
<Kenji> :x
<Kenji> wing it!
<Drake> 04haaaah
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04I got 20/50 on my maths exam AFTER I corrected some marks
<Drake> 04also
<Drake> 04http://pastebin.com/xu7EsQ7N
<Drake> 04also I'm screwed for my English Ext speech
<Drake> 04meant to be 6-8min and I think I barely reach 4 minutes
<Iago> ._.
<Iago> just uh
<Iago> repeat things
<Iago> and talk slowly
<Iago> asshole Drake
<Kenji> no no
<Drake> 04Talking slowly is my best hope
<Iago> you're meant to do it as unlisted
<Kenji> not repeat things
<Iago> not private
<Kenji> go into unneeded details
<Drake> 04I'm putting on a british voice to sound weird
*Iago slaps Drake
<Iago> unlisted
<Drake> 04and drag it out
<Iago> not private
<Iago> for pastebin
*Drake avoids
<Drake> 04ok ok
<Drake> 04It used to be private
*Drake changes
<Iago> hurry
<Iago> need to go soon
<Drake> 04http://pastebin.com/xu7EsQ7N
<Drake> 04there
<Iago> 'exercise,'
<Iago> should be 'exercise',
<Drake> 04oh
<Iago> 1.It wasn't long before they finished, and at the conclusion of the exercise Irres was panting heavily at the strain the forms had caused.
<Iago> probably make that 'but' instead of 'and'
<Iago> or well
<Iago> 'but even then, at the con-etc.etc.'
<Iago> to put emphasis on the time and stuff
<Drake> 04uh-huh
<Iago> “Besides, all I instructed you were that it required a body part with key importance to your being, and as a dragon your tail is incredibly important for balance.”
<Iago> should be was not were
<Iago> 15.“In theory, yes,” Dyan answered. “However, since no dragon can make themselves rely on a body part they normally cannot.
<Iago> comma after 'body part'
<Iago> took me a while to figure out what you meant
<Iago> you need that comma Drake
<Iago> but very, very few dragons can focus their magical energies enough to project flame, ice or lightning from their nostrils.”
<Iago> that extra very kills the flow of the speech/sentence
<Iago> get rid of it
<Iago> 17.“And how would I focus myself enough to summon fire upon my tail?”
<Iago> 18.
<Iago> 19.“That relies greatly on what you use it for.
<Iago> that makes no sense at all
<Iago> topics are completely different
<Iago> make it a logical answer Drake
<Iago> “I…The function of my tail is of balance, to keep my body from falling to the ground or losing control when flying.
<Iago> that of isn't needed
<Iago> "The final, and perhaps most important use of my tail, is in order to convey my feelings and emotions at the point in time."
<Iago> no need for the in order
<Iago> When I am happy, my tail swings from side to side slowly. When I am angry, it quivers. When I am afraid, tis tucked between my legs.”
<Iago> should be 'tis not tis
<Iago> same with Irres' next line
<Iago> “Well done Irres.
<Iago> comma after done
<Iago> other than those grammatical errors Drake
<Iago> it's pretty damn good
<Iago> anyway poof

<NightSeas> 12brb
<SkylanderDrobot> Hello.
<Rivus> 7Hey guys
<Rivus> 7Eh, I guess the place is pretty empty right now, huh?
<Rivus> 7I guess I'll see you guys around then
<prince-dari> Hey Kjakings.
<Kjakings> 7Hey Dari
<Kjakings> 7can't really talk. playing SR3
<prince-dari> Ah, ok
<Kjakings> 7Ok I'm done blowing up the implausible flying ship of implausible.
<NightSeas> 12ohai
<Kimori> hi
<Kimori> hi
<NightSeas> 12ohai SkylanderDrobot
<Rivus> 7'Afternoon, everyone.
<NightSeas> 12hi Rivus
<prince-dari> Hey.
<NightSeas> 12hey prince-dari
<Rivus> 7Everyone alright? P:
<NightSeas> 12yep
<Rivus> 7Good, good.. whatcha up to?
<NightSeas> 12nothing much tbh XD
<Rivus> 7Haha XP Me neither
<NightSeas> 12looks like this place is starting to fill up with users
<Rivus> 7Yep
<prince-dari> So long since it was active in here. :/
<Rivus> 7Eh, I wouldn't know, I joined yesterday.
<Rivus> 7I've noticed how empty the forums are though.. hm. I was eager to chat 'n roleplay in there.
<NightSeas> 12you should still try
<NightSeas> 12needs the activity
<Rivus> 7Oh, I will.
<NightSeas> 12As much as I respect the owner, he’s not really playing his part in keeping this place active
<Rivus> 7Again, I wouldn't really know.
<NightSeas> 12maybe that will change if he sees more active activity
<NightSeas> 12-active
<Rivus> 7Maybe. If someone/ I made a good roleplay I'd be very active there.
<Rivus> 7And that would probably revive the RP threads a little, and the activity would expand. Maybe.
<prince-dari> SR hasn't really done much sitewise for a while.
<prince-dari> He switched to a new host fairly recently.
<prince-dari> But as for site updates, nothing.
<prince-dari> And he won't give admin powers to any of the mods.
<Rivus> 7Hum..
<prince-dari> He's not really interested in Spyro any more, but he's keeping the site up anyway.
<Rivus> 7Ah. Well, we should be thankful for that at least.
<prince-dari> Yeah, he does pay quite a lot to keep it up, I just don't understand why he doesn't give admin powers to some of the mods so someone can actually do something with the site
<Rivus> Whoops
<Rivus> 7I better go. Its 2am and my eyes are burning. Seeya round, guys.
<prince-dari> Cya
<Rivus> 7Byee xP
<NightSeas> 12pretty soon it'll just be me dari and Kimori again .-.
<prince-dari> Yep. :<
<prince-dari> I wonder where SR's got to, he doesn't even idle in here any more.
<NightSeas> 12yeah
<Kimori> aww I missed someone >.>
<Kimori> I havent seen him idle in a real long time
<Kimori> I would hope that this place doesn't go back to what it was last month
<NightSeas> 12same
<Kimori> Its nice to see someone new join here, just gotta hope it will continue
<NightSeas> 12I should kick ChanServ?
*NightSeas runs
<NightSeas> 12jk
<Kimori> lol
<NightSeas> 12I bet SR will do that :/
<Kimori> :/
<Kimori> I need to idle for a bit, bbl
<NightSeas> 12see ya
<Kimori> back
<NightSeas> 12wb
<NightSeas> 12LOL one hour late
<Kimori> lol
<Kimori> yeah exactly one hour
<Kimori> are you still doing classwork?
<NightSeas> 12not today, fortunately
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Kimori> :P
<Kimori> Ive been on spring break all week
<NightSeas> 12I wish I got breaks
<Kimori> I didnt really get to do much though, was busy doing other things
<NightSeas> 12do you have MK7?
<NightSeas> 12(Mario Kart 7)
<Kimori> nope
<NightSeas> 12ah
<Kimori> you wanted to play?
<Kimori> I have starfox command
<Kimori> but havent played that game in a long time :P
<prince-dari> PS2 for best console of all time
<prince-dari> Then gameboy colour because pokemon blue/silver.
<Kimori> Why PS2?
<prince-dari> Because it's the top selling console of all time, has literally thousands of brilliant games, plus all of the great PS1 games can be played on it, and because PS2 games are still made to this day, and the console is still sold to this day, which is a hell of a lot better than any other console is doing, or has ever done.
<Kimori> If you wanna talk about a system that can play older games theres the gameboy
<Kimori> the gameboy advance played all GB cartridges from 1989
<Kimori> and up
<prince-dari> I never thought the advance looked as good as the colour, don't know why, it was just weird and wide, though I did have an SP
<Kimori> you mean the system itself?
<NightSeas> 12the DS passed the PS2 in sells last year
<prince-dari> You mean the DS in all of its incarnations, or an individual type?
<prince-dari> DS, DS lite, 3DS, etc
<Kimori> you mentioned the advanced didnt look as good as the color
<NightSeas> 12just DS, DS Lite and DSi
<prince-dari> Kimori: That's probably just personal preference because I never owned an advance
<Kimori> oh
<NightSeas> 123DS is a entirely different consol
<prince-dari> Still, I count those as different consolse, like I count, gameboy, gameboy colour, gameboy advance, and gameboy advance SP as different consoles.
<NightSeas> 12console*
<prince-dari> consoles*
<NightSeas> 12those are
<NightSeas> 12but, they all played different games
<NightSeas> 12and the DS can't play 3DS game
<NightSeas> 12games*
<NightSeas> 12where as, the DSi and DS Lite played the same games
<prince-dari> Gameboy and gameboy colour game cartridges were the same
<NightSeas> 12yes, but the Gameboy couldn't play gameboy colour games
<Kimori> Have you ever played them on a Super Gameboy?
<Kimori> I thought it really looked awesome when I tried playing them on the tv
<NightSeas> 12same
<NightSeas> 12also, the PS2 had a few incarnations
<NightSeas> 12Slim and regular
<Kimori> Finding a PS2 in an original box has been a challenge >.>
<NightSeas> 12really? You can still buy them brand new XD
<prince-dari> Wiki still lists PS2 as best selling, above DS.
<prince-dari> Though only by 2.5m
<NightSeas> 12that got outdated a few months ago
<prince-dari> Is that old then?
<NightSeas> 12ah, see
<NightSeas> 12http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-2-Console-Slim-Black/dp/B000TLU67W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1333948486&sr=8-1
<NightSeas> 12you can still buy it brand new
<Kimori> you cant buy an original PS2 brand new
<Kimori> unless you wanna pay a lot for it
<Kimori> that one is the slim version
<NightSeas> 12you would want the slim one though
<Kimori> why?
<NightSeas> 12the old one is huge XD
<Kimori> true
<Kimori> but I like the tray
<prince-dari> The old PS2 which I have is smaller than my slim PS3
<Kimori> vs the top loader
<prince-dari> So, not that big
<Kimori> the PS3 slim is really stripped down compared to the actual PS3 from 2006
<NightSeas> 12well, it's big compared to the slim
<prince-dari> I think PS2 is actually still beating the DS
<prince-dari> That's as of January?
<prince-dari> Was it really recent that the DS took over?
<NightSeas> 12I think so
<prince-dari> Hmm
<NightSeas> 12Ohh, that’s combined with 3DS sells. So that claim wouldn’t be legit
<NightSeas> 12it's still close though, even without 3DS sells
<prince-dari> Ah, yeah.
<prince-dari> Still, PS2 gets to keeps its top spot for a little longer
<NightSeas> 12yeah
<Kimori> I could never stick with the PS2
<NightSeas> 12I could never stick with just one brand XD
<Kimori> Think the only series I really got hooked on was sly cooper
<NightSeas> 12I play both PS and Nintendo stuff
<prince-dari> Well, I do have other consoles, but I do love my PS2
<NightSeas> 12same
<Kimori> Atari still rocks :)
<NightSeas> 12PS2, DS, 3DS and PS3 are my favs
<NightSeas> 12and wii
<prince-dari> I have a PS2, PS3, and Wii, for non-handheld consoles.
<prince-dari> PS1 is probably still around somewhere. XD
<NightSeas> 12as for older ones, N64, GBC and PS1 were my favs XD
<Kimori> those are all the consoles you have?
<NightSeas> 12and Gamegear
<NightSeas> 12nope
<Kimori> You should see the game gear accessories I have NightSeas :P
<NightSeas> 12GameGear was awesome
<prince-dari> I never had N64, GBC, SNES/NES. :<
<Kimori> awww
<Kimori> Theres a bunch of consoles I wanna own
<NightSeas> 12N64 was awesome, however you can download the best N64 games on the wii
<Kimori> Ive been wanting to get my hands on a sega master system
<NightSeas> 12if you do, get all the Zelda N64 games
<NightSeas> 12those were awesome
<Kimori> The virtual console feature on the wii is nice and all but what happens when it becomes outdated?
<Kimori> I prefer cartridges
<NightSeas> 12it can't really
<Kimori> What I mean is, you are rebuying a game
<Kimori> unless you havent played it before
<NightSeas> 12yeah, but then you don't have to worry about the N64 remote breaking XD
<Kimori> ?
<NightSeas> 12Controller*
<Kimori> I only had one break on me but that was because it wasnt an official controller
<NightSeas> 12Since you can use the classic wii controller
<NightSeas> 12my parents never got official ones :/
<prince-dari> I think the only Zelda game I've played is TP, which was good, but people always seem to talk most favourably about the older games, OOT, Wind Waker, Majora's Mask.
<NightSeas> 12Skyward sword, TP and Majora's Mask are my favs
<Kimori> I'm probably old fashion *shrugs*
<Kimori> The gameplay just feels so much better when you play it on the actual console
<prince-dari> ^
<Kimori> original console that is..
<prince-dari> Which is why I love playing pokemon blue/silver on a gameboy colour.
<prince-dari> It feels so good.
<Kimori> yeah!
<NightSeas> 12true, but I ended up with a bunch of un-official N64 controllers
<Kimori> you can still buy em
<NightSeas> 12which is a pain XD
<NightSeas> 12true
<Kimori> just try looking in 2nd hand stores
<Kimori> I gotta go
<NightSeas> 12see ya
<Kimori> see you two laters
<prince-dari> Hm
<prince-dari> Well, just me, you, and SkylanderDrobot.
<NightSeas> 12yep
<prince-dari> Oh and ChanServ, how could I forget poor ChanServ.
<prince-dari> :P
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<prince-dari> Did you come to the IRC first then, or the forums, in terms of SF?
<prince-dari> I'd guess the IRC?
<NightSeas> 12yep
<NightSeas> 12found this channel on mibbit search
<prince-dari> Ahh
<prince-dari> LLOTS used to be a member of SF
<NightSeas> 12really?
<NightSeas> 12didn't know he was a fan
<prince-dari> Yeah, he was the one who introduced me to TST.
<NightSeas> 12I introduced Kimori to TST although he doesn't visit very much
<prince-dari> eXAKR turned up in this chat room a couple of times a while ago too
<NightSeas> 12you should visit more
<NightSeas> 12well, pony fans tend to also be spyro fans XD
<prince-dari> Hah, would seem so. XD
<NightSeas> 12it almost never fails. I always find out someone's also a spyro fan when their a pony fan. lmao
<prince-dari> Heheh, funny thing is the reason I started watching MLP is because friends from SF told me I should watch it. XD
<NightSeas> 12same, only it was people at TST XD
<NightSeas> 12started watching it thinking I wouldn't care for it then I started likeing it .-.
<NightSeas> 12liking*
<prince-dari> Ahh, I had no idea what to expect.
<prince-dari> I remember the first ep I watched, I cringed for the intro, and was thinking 'OH GOD NO' when the singing started in the ep.
<prince-dari> Now I like the songs, lawl.
<prince-dari> It grew on me I suppose
<NightSeas> 12LOL same
<prince-dari> Hah
<prince-dari> They brainwash you the more you watch. :P
<NightSeas> 12indeed
<prince-dari> I also had bried moment of 'Why the hell am I watching this?' when I realised the intro didn't sound all so terrible to me any more. XP
<prince-dari> brief*
<NightSeas> 12some people were smart and didn't watch in long enough for that to happen :<
<prince-dari> Hah, yeah, lucky escape. XD
<prince-dari> You tell anyone IRL that you watch it?
<NightSeas> 12it*
<NightSeas> 12yep, but only when I find out they do too
<prince-dari> Ahh, I haven't told any friends, only family.
<NightSeas> 12so far I've only told one XD
<NightSeas> 12and my family knows
<NightSeas> 12but that's their falt :X
<prince-dari> :o?
<NightSeas> 12fault*
<NightSeas> 12wanting to know what I watch XD
<prince-dari> Ahh
<NightSeas> 12something people should never ask me XD
<prince-dari> Heh.
<prince-dari> How'd they react to it? XD
<NightSeas> 12well, they were just like "... OK"
<NightSeas> 12lmao
<prince-dari> Hahahaha
<prince-dari> My family were alright with it, and my dad saw it as a perfect opportunity to crack some 'My Little Porny' jokes. :P
<prince-dari> I had my revenge anyway, heh.
<NightSeas> 12XD
<prince-dari> You have any pony merch?
<NightSeas> 12nope
<prince-dari> Ah, I've just got a blind bag Twilight.
<NightSeas> 12nice
<prince-dari> Took it with me when we went to climb some the highest peaks in the UK - got some weird looks when I was taking photos with it on the top. :P
<NightSeas> 12LOL nice XD
<prince-dari> Got some pretty good pictures though.

<NightSeas> 12XD
<prince-dari> Yeah, I dunno why, but when I see a mountain, I just get this feeling of 'I HAVE TO CONQUER YOU!'.
<prince-dari> And it's worth it for the awesome views, and the feeling when you reach the peak.
*junh1024-XD slaps Ascendant
<NightSeas> 12true
<Armageddon> rawr u
<prince-dari> If you have any good peaks near you, you should go try it.
<NightSeas> 12there's one I should try, but I don't think it's as high as that one XD
<junh1024-XD> ┓(ﾟヘﾟ;)┏ﾟ
<NightSeas> 12there where some good ones in AZ
<NightSeas> 12(Arizona)
<prince-dari> Ah
<drfsupercenter> 03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/internet-troll-isnt-that-just-racist.jpg
<prince-dari> Yeah, there's a lot of bigger mountains in the US than the biggest in the UK obviously, so you've probably got a better choice than I have. :P
<NightSeas> 12yeah
<prince-dari> Thoguh I've been looking to do the three peaks challenge
<prince-dari> though*
<NightSeas> 12I heard there's some high ones in france
<drfsupercenter> 03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/koma-comic-strip-ohh-bokki-hes-so-cute.png
<prince-dari> Yeah, people always talk about Mont Blanc when it comes to French mountains, so that's probably the biggest.
<NightSeas> 12I think so
<prince-dari> The Alps are partly in France too aren't they?

<drf-Droid> though my next class, no phones allowed :<
<Umbreon> :<
<drf-Droid> so Umbreon
<Umbreon> what kind of dumb class would allow phones anyway
<drf-Droid> why were you tagged in a photo of a dog in the back of a van, LO
<drf-Droid> *l
<Umbreon> because someone wanted to show it to me
<Umbreon> so they highlighted it as best as they could by tagging me with it
<drf-Droid> that's an odd way to show someone a picture

<drf-Droid> f'ing CPU intensive games
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drf-Droid> the game is called Tangram X
<drf-Droid> it made the phone heat up quite a bit and I lose about 20% battery life in 10 mins
<Xanbreon> probs just really badly coded
<Xanbreon> :D
<drf-Droid> yep, another 10%
<drf-Droid> drain
<drf-Droid> I even ran ATK and killed all but IRC
<drf-Droid> :/
<drf-Droid> btw
<Xanbreon> mhhm?
<drf-Droid> http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg <- ever had this happen with adw?
<drf-Droid> where the dots don't rotate back
<drf-Droid> seems to happen to me all the time :/
<Xanbreon> Think its a common problem
<drf-Droid> http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg
<drf-Droid> er
<Xanbreon> I dont get why you like those dots so much
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> look at the middle things too
<Xanbreon> You can get a slider above the dock, or even dots at the top of the screen
<Xanbreon> And 5 item dock > 3 items
<drf-Droid> http://www.imgur.com/YG5tM.jpg
<drf-Droid> ...
<Xanbreon> You have pasted the same link 3 times now
<Xanbreon> ;P
<drf-Droid> god dang hold on
<Xanbreon> ;)
<drf-Droid> http://www.imgur.com/MDeGT.jpg
<drf-Droid> there
<drf-Droid> that's what it should look like
<drf-Droid> see the 3 dock icons?
<Xanbreon> Mhhm
<drf-Droid> those get screwed too :/
<Xanbreon> basic ADW is kinda buggy
<drf-Droid> does ex have that problem?
<Xanbreon> Nope
<Xanbreon> The dots are gone though
<drf-Droid> but the dock doesn't screw itself?
<Xanbreon> Pretty sure it doesnt
<drf-Droid> hm
<drf-Droid> can I get it to look more 'flat' and not like a bookshelf?
<Xanbreon> The dock? sure, just swap the background or turn it off in the theme settings
<drf-Droid> I couldn't figure out how o.o
<Xanbreon> Theres a frackton of dock themes
<drf-Droid> well
<Xanbreon> Tis in themes
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drf-Droid> if I could get ex to look like the free one...
<Xanbreon> Sure, apart from the dots
<drf-Droid> why can't I get the dots :(
<Xanbreon> Because they where removed
<Xanbreon> As almost everyone hated them
<drf-Droid> gaaaaay
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> you could turn them off
<Xanbreon> NOU
<drf-Droid> >_>
<Xanbreon> moar features moar bugs
<drf-Droid> can I get some sort of buttons down there to switch screens without swiping?
<drf-Droid> that's why I like the dots, just tap to switch :P
<Xanbreon> Let me see
<Xanbreon> Gotta install adw again >_>
<drf-Droid> what you using now? o.o
<Xanbreon> trebuchet

<Xanbreon> Mhhm
<Xanbreon> I tried apex and nova
<Xanbreon> They had more options, that I wouldnt use
<drf-Droid> but meh, I hated CM9 ICS, it was buggy as frick and the GUI looked 'dumber'
<Xanbreon> And didnt have the same "smooth" feel
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drf-Droid> more iPad like and less power user
<Xanbreon> buggy will be due to early stages of bringup etc
<drf-Droid> well that and LOL droid 2

<drf-Droid> yeah
<drf-Droid> those are just indicators though
<Xanbreon> Ah they are as well
<Xanbreon> Doesnt seem to be anything todo that
<Xanbreon> O-o
<Xanbreon> You dislike swiping? O-o
<drf-Droid> that's what I thought :/
<drf-Droid> yes
<drf-Droid> just tapping the corners is easier and faster
<Xanbreon> Unno, I found it annoying and a waste of screen space :P
<drf-Droid> I only need 3 dock things
<drf-Droid> I intentionally keep it at 3 :/
<Xanbreon> phone > sms > app draw > contacts > chrome beta

<drfsupercenter> 03before they had an official title for the clean one
<drfsupercenter> 03it was that
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03they didn't change it to "forget you" for a couple months after
<Lighty> 06i know
<Lighty> 06as i first said
<Lighty> 06"Lame rephrase"
<drfsupercenter> 03well you were playing the actually dirty version :P
<drfsupercenter> 03also EW 128kbps
<Lighty> 06just because they dont like to say swears
<drfsupercenter> 03go quality wh0re some more
<drfsupercenter> 03...this version doesn't say the swear words either, derp
<drfsupercenter> 03it's still a clean version
<drfsupercenter> 03just a DIFFERENT clean version
<Lighty> 06..
<Lighty> 06still wimps imo
<Lighty> 06xD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03contrary to popular belief, swearing does not in fact make you cool
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Lighty> 06i know
<Lighty> 06i dont swear
<Lighty> 06i think the idea of rephrasing the song 2 times AND re-editing it is kinda stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03well what else would you do
<drfsupercenter> 03just not play it on the radio at all?
<Lighty> 06like, swearing is a frown, but being a wimp and not taking it is also stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but there are things called laws about what you can and can't say LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not a big deal to YOU because your country doesn't speak English natively
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sure swearing in whatever language people speak there is worse than in English

<drfsupercenter> 03you are a neat freak if I've ever seen one Viri

<drfsupercenter> 03I literally just type l in Firefox and hit tab, enter
<drfsupercenter> 03since it's recognized.
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't even have it bookmarked, why bother?
<Viri> 14xD
<drfsupercenter> 03I tend to only bookmark sites I keep as reference and don't visit often, as ones I DO visit often just show up when I type the names
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03like Facebook, my email, etc
<Viri> 14it's the opposite for me xP
<Viri> 14I don't know...I find it easier for some reason
<Viri> 14brb
<drfsupercenter> 03also, real pros just edit the icons themselves

<Espeon> 06why would you care if viri uses bookmarks or not anyway
<Espeon> 06myself I just type a few letters then down + enter because lazy

<drf|away> 03<Espeon> why would you care if viri uses bookmarks or not anyway <- I don't,b ut he was complaining about TST not having a favicon so I was saying it's pointless to even bookmark it in the first place
<drf|away> 03and with that, bbl
<Viri> 14back
<Viri> 14x3 I just find the bookmarks toolbar cute
<Espeon> 06haha favicons it always confuse me because there's sites I go to that have really similar ones.

<Umbreon> i wasn't sure how else to get this song
<drfsupercenter> 03but they're really badly mastered
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a bit obnoxious

<Kjakings> 7Hey. sorry xD been totally ignoring you the past couple days.
<Viri> 14o.o
<prince-dari> Lol, no problem
<Kjakings> 7In my defence, I've spent about the past hour trying to convince my GF to shower at mine tomorrow :P
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Fair play. :P
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 6Girafarig.
<Kjakings> 7I should've been doing IT coursework really, but the course is a pile of shit.
<drfsupercenter> 03so hm
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently Facebook timeline hides that person's email now?
<drfsupercenter> 03I swear it used to show the emai8l they used to register for Facebook
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<prince-dari> God I hate coursework.
<prince-dari> I hate exams too though.
<prince-dari> I just hate work.
<prince-dari> :P
<Kjakings> 7I don't mind exams. I despise coursework. I much prefer exams.

<Viri> 14good night
<Skylands> 1018:48] <%drfsupercenter> I swear it used to show the emai8l they used to register for Facebook
<Skylands> 10yeah, as mine is still there
<drfsupercenter> 03I think timeline lets you hide it
<Kjakings> 7Exams are just /over/, you know? coursework drags
<Skylands> 10I don't have enough stuff to create a timeline. I dislike the looks of it anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, see my conversation with Arti on her profile
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently it'll hide the email by default
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<drfsupercenter> 03and yeah I hate timeline
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks ugly and I actually really like the "info" pane
<prince-dari> As long as it's not English coursework it's probably piss easy though.
<drfsupercenter> 03it reduces that to some crappy tiny thing
<NightSeas> 12Hiding your email from people that found your face book page. Makes sense :D
<NightSeas> 12facebook*
<prince-dari> Hey NightSeas
<Kjakings> 7oh yeah it's easy. but it's fuckin' long as.
<Kjakings> 7hey NightSeas
<Skylands> 10I figured out how to hide it
*Skylands does so now.
<NightSeas> 12I don't see the point
<NightSeas> 12I mean
<Kjakings> 7Um. Dari. a thought. In our 'SC as a family' metaphor, of course the majority of the children have moved out of the house; but is NightSeas like the step-father? Or would that be Lambda?
<Skylands> 10Can you confirm, DRF?
<NightSeas> 12everyone on earth knows your hotmail XD
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Skylands> 10It's not my hotmail, NightSeas
<Skylands> 10It is my personal gmail.
<NightSeas> 12ah
<NightSeas> 12Ohai prince-dari and Kjakings
<Skylands> 10Someone confirmmmm
<Skylands> 10NightSeas, check my Info and scroll to email
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not there
<Skylands> 10k
<drfsupercenter> 03Darn, I should have copied that down first
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skylands> 10:P
<NightSeas> 12you still want me to check? XD
<Kjakings> 7I suppose, since the supposed parents left and a lot of the children ran away from home as a result, NightSeas is the social worker?
<Skylands> 10Nah
<drfsupercenter> 03also LOL @ cutoff
<NightSeas> 12alright
<drfsupercenter> 03"Back when I was your age, Pluto was a plane"
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Yeah, I suppose so. XD
<Skylands> 10t
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I nkoiw
<drfsupercenter> 03*know
<drfsupercenter> 03but Pluto as a plane is cooler :D
<Skylands> 10and the days when Uranus was pronounced the dirty way
<NightSeas> 12lmao
<Skylands> 10Seriously, up until like, middle school
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it's always been said either way
<Skylands> 10is when they said people were saying Uranus wrong
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I still do pronounce Uranus the dirty way
<Angel_Umbreon> 13and probably always will |3
<drfsupercenter> 03>sees The Twilight Saga on your profile
<drfsupercenter> 03pardon me while I go vomit
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<Kjakings> 7See, NightSeas, this is why - if you want to bring the family back together - you go to Spyroforum and you talk to the mother (Stormy). You get her assistance and the children (chatters of SF) may begin returning.
<Skylands> 10You never knew?
<drfsupercenter> 03I never really cared
<Skylands> 10I've read all the books, seen all the movies
<Skylands> 10and yes
<Skylands> 10I plan to see Breaking Dawn part 3
<Skylands> 102*
<drfsupercenter> 03Facebook is like, the polite way of shoving your interests down other people's throats
<NightSeas> 12fan girl D:
<Skylands> 10no.
<drfsupercenter> 03WHen they first added that
<Skylands> 10It's like THG, the story's decent, but >fanbase
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like "b*** please"
<drfsupercenter> 03and even now I think I only have like two things LOL
<NightSeas> 12I know
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL STORY IS DECENT
<drfsupercenter> 03Isn't that the overstatement of the century
<Skylands> 10IT IS
*drfsupercenter hides
<Skylands> 10The Hunger Games > Twilight however
<Skylands> 10Twilight is a fad
<drfsupercenter> 03agreed, but replace THG with * and that works
<drfsupercenter> 03o/` you're a fad, which means something that we already had, but once you're gone you don't come back o/` </Dr. Dre>
<NightSeas> 12THG characters were way better though
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently my friend thought Katniss was hot
<drfsupercenter> 03I disagree
<drfsupercenter> 03she's just "eh"
<Skylands> 10yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03there were no hot girls in that movie, which was totally disappointing :<
*drfsupercenter runs
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Skylands> 10Hurr
<Skylands> 10What movie has a hot girl in it then?
<drfsupercenter> 03Hot Rod.
<drfsupercenter> 03and no that's not some sort of joke, that's the actual title
<drfsupercenter> 03also Easy A
<prince-dari> You know, I think I've seen DFOKN once since he disappeared.
<drfsupercenter> 03and so on
<Skylands> 10Pic or name of person?
<drfsupercenter> 03sec
<Kjakings> 7really?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PG0VmDiAL.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03that girl
<prince-dari> Yeah, I remember he turned up one time a while ago, when I hadn't seen him for years.
<drfsupercenter> 03though she's like, really old, stupid makeup LOL
<NightSeas> 12That’s so typical drf :/
<drfsupercenter> 03what is
<Kjakings> 7wow
<NightSeas> 12Liking the girls in that movie XD
<Skylands> 10eh @ pic
<Skylands> 10then again I don't find girls appealing
<drfsupercenter> 03there's only one, LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Emma Stone is the girl in Easy A
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't see movies just because certain people are in them
<NightSeas> 12she's okay
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike girls who just go "OMG LEONARDO DICAPRIO MUST WATCH"
<Angel_Umbreon> 13He be overrated :D
<drfsupercenter> 03well, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, all of those
<drfsupercenter> 03it's typical fangirl behavior, seeing movies just because an actor you like is in them
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sure some guys do that but it's not as typical XD
<NightSeas> 12Johnny Depp is overrated
<drfsupercenter> 03agreed
<NightSeas> 12although he is a good actor, but still overratted
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<drfsupercenter> 03anything good is overrated
<drfsupercenter> 0399% of the time
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<NightSeas> 12true
<NightSeas> 12so I'm overratted? :D
<drfsupercenter> 03rather, anything good and popular
<NightSeas> 12overrated*
<NightSeas> 12can I test my rain dance team on someone on PO? derp
<drfsupercenter> 03oh nice
<drfsupercenter> 03I can type in Facebook emails for Draw Something and it actually works
*drfsupercenter starts a match with Articuno
<NightSeas> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03who in the frick is Flootershai
<NightSeas> 12someone with too many feet?
<Skylands> 10Ripred
<drfsupercenter> 03o
<drfsupercenter> 03*oh
<drfsupercenter> 03I should just delete his
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skylands> 10he posted in your topic
<NightSeas> 12Skylands
<NightSeas> 12PO now D:
<Skylands> 10Nope
<Skylands> 10anime
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<NightSeas> 12alright
<drfsupercenter> 03so Skylands, this sub in my class this morning just randomly started talking about anime
<Skylands> 10Orly
<Skylands> 10Tell me about it
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<drfsupercenter> 03he was like
<NightSeas> 12must have been a smart sub sandwish
*NightSeas runs
<NightSeas> 12Sandwich*
<drfsupercenter> 03"Words don't actually mean anything most of the time, you just associate them with things. Like, the Japanese just start making up words for anime titles. There was this one, well I forget the title, but I think in Japanese it literally meant "undead [something something]" and not only is it about girls with guns but it's about ZOMBIE girls with guns. Fun was had by all"
<drfsupercenter> 03or something like that
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<NightSeas> 12that sounds like Puella Magi XD
<Skylands> 10wat
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually want to watch that show, when it's fully dubbed
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid 4 episode sets costing over $100 >_>
<Skylands> 10DRF wants to watch Puella Magi?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Angel_Umbreon> 13streaming online ftw
<drfsupercenter> 03but I hate subs
<drfsupercenter> 03dubs or gtfo
<NightSeas> 12^
<drfsupercenter> 03but junh was telling me there are only 4 episodes out
<Skylands> 10Why
<Skylands> 10do I feel
<Skylands> 10super excited about this
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<Skylands> 10Also, what caught your interest? :P
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll be a few months
<drfsupercenter> 03the third dub set is slated to come out like the end of june
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03when someone told me it was only 12 episodeds
<drfsupercenter> 03-d
<Skylands> 10inb4 me
<Skylands> 10oh
<drfsupercenter> 03I've always wanted to watch more anime
<drfsupercenter> 03but the ones people recommend
<drfsupercenter> 03are stupidly long
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm not going to just waste weeks at a time watching shows LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but 12 episodes? I can do that in a day
<drfsupercenter> 03easily
<drfsupercenter> 03if there are any other SHORT anime series that are good... LOL
<Skylands> 10Panty Stocking and Garterbelt
*Skylands dies
<NightSeas> 12Code geass is pretty short
<drfsupercenter> 03that show sounds awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not fully dubbed yet
<drfsupercenter> 03is it?
<Skylands> 10uh
<Skylands> 10I think it is
<drfsupercenter> 03is it?
<NightSeas> 12it is
<drfsupercenter> 03I know they were dubbing it
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, the whole thing is done?
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<Skylands> 10Prepare for tons of innuendos though
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually had an interest in that one when it was out in Japan
<drfsupercenter> 03because >perverted
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skylands> 10Of course :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but I just hate subtitled stuff, it bugs me
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I watch everything with closed captions
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, same-language subtitles
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's because I can just read it if I mishear
<drfsupercenter> 03instead of "WAIT WHAT WAS THAT, GOTTA REWIND" 20 times
<NightSeas> 12another good short one is Wolf's Rain
<drfsupercenter> 03never even heard of it o.o
<Skylands> 10You know, the first 4 episodes of Puella dub -are- online
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked Bleach
<drfsupercenter> 03but that show goes on forever
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03why watch 1/3 of the show only to have to wait?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd rather just wait
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Ew Bleach
<Angel_Umbreon> 13it belongs in the toilet
<Angel_Umbreon> 13:3
<Soital> 12Wolfs rain had fillers
<drfsupercenter> 03Bleach was actually pretty good
<drfsupercenter> 03but I only saw ~30 episodes
<drfsupercenter> 03as at the time, there were only 8 dub DVDs
<Skylands> 10If you buy it on DVD and it turns out you don't enjoy it
<Soital> 12and cheza was annoying
<drfsupercenter> 03each having 3-4 episodes
<Skylands> 10Send it over to me
*Skylands dies
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03>buying
<Soital> 12but the last two episodes were good
<Skylands> 10well
<drfsupercenter> 03once Asian DVD Club comes back
<Skylands> 10Amazon is selling it
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sure someone will upload the ISOs
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Skylands> 10for like $80
<drfsupercenter> 03for stupidly high amounts of money
<Skylands> 10>rip off
<NightSeas> 12oh gosh cheza XD
<drfsupercenter> 03eaxctly
<drfsupercenter> 03sdk
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylands
<drfsupercenter> 03the company that released that
<drfsupercenter> 03is known for that sort of thing
<Skylands> 10Aniplex
<NightSeas> 12I hated her
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently some of their shows are only available in like $400 sets

<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<NightSeas> 12want to know which anime is the shortest?
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm not judging only by length
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't want to watch some obnoxiously long series
<NightSeas> 12Pokemon. It only has 700 Episodes
<NightSeas> 12:3
<drfsupercenter> 03that's like the one show I actually saw :p
<drfsupercenter> 03and I stopped after season 8
<drfsupercenter> 03which is farther than most people got
<NightSeas> 12but there's still 8 more to go D:
<NightSeas> 12and I know what mean
<NightSeas> 12what you mean*
<NightSeas> 12Card captors was good, but it has like 80 episodes
<Skylands> 10I watched up to the first several episodes of DP

<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03let me let the thing reload
<Aurora> 6and what does it look like
<Soital> 12I remember a few months ago I tuned into CITV and they were showing a random diamond and pearl episode
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks like some box with pacman in it
<drfsupercenter> 03saying "eww"

*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think so
<NightSeas> 12that would apply to Skylands
*NightSeas runs
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly NightSeas
<Skylands> 10I don't get it
<Skylands> 10Zig zag
<Skylands> 10wait

<Aurora> 6nichijou
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/J1JX7.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03That was like
<drfsupercenter> 03the most creative drawing ever
*drfsupercenter runs
<drfsupercenter> 03at least when *I* had Shrek, I drew a happyface with green ears and wrote "animated movie" above it
<NightSeas> 12drf art D:
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03read what it says
<Aurora> 6lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I was guessing their drawing
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03that same person
<Aurora> 6my friends and I
<Aurora> 6get way too into this
<drfsupercenter> 03gave me a COMPLETELY BLANK SCREEN
<NightSeas> 12oh
<Aurora> 6and also completely out of it
<drfsupercenter> 03the word was "white"
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF liek magical gurls
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03so for the next one, I wrote "LOL I see what you did there" then made a new page with the proper drawing
<drfsupercenter> 03also gah
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't seem to get screenshots to work in Draw Something anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03since it involves holding the search button and that app hijacks it
<drfsupercenter> 03still trying to screenshot this drawing
<Aurora> 6how do you take screenshots on an android?
<drfsupercenter> 03you need root
<Aurora> 6or is that phone specifc
<Aurora> 6oh
<drfsupercenter> 03it's both
<drfsupercenter> 03some phones have it built in
<drfsupercenter> 03mine doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03so I have an app
<drfsupercenter> 03you just long-press search
<drfsupercenter> 03but in stuff like Android IRC that uses the search key for other things, it gets annoying LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03so I have to long-press search then really quickly jump back to the app
<NightSeas> 12there's even hyper cams for android
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6kick one of them
<drfsupercenter> 03can I kick both
*drfsupercenter hides
<ReshHaii> Resh= ReshZek200) Haii= HaiiTehReshiram
<ReshHaii> XD
<Aurora> 6preferably the longer name
<Aurora> 6oh ok
<HyperMetalLugia> kick all
<HyperMetalLugia> of nthem
<HyperMetalLugia> aww
<HyperMetalLugia> ;<
<ReshHaii> yay the other one quit
<Skylands> 10wait
<ReshHaii> which was me. )
<Skylands> 10there's an app for screenshot?
<Aurora> 6yeah we know
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03iof you have root
<drfsupercenter> 03*if
<HyperMetalLugia> DURR
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a few apps
<Skylands> 10Well
<Skylands> 10>root
<Skylands> 10:I
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to use one called ShootMe
<drfsupercenter> 03but that requires you to shake the phone
<drfsupercenter> 03this one that Xanbreon helped me find
<HyperMetalLugia> I tried to root Sky's droid
<drfsupercenter> 03is called drocap2
<Skylands> 10better than nothing
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually knew about that app before
<drfsupercenter> 03but didn't know you could map it to search
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03you long-press search and it just takes a screenshot with drocap
<drfsupercenter> 03my Droid 2 had it built in
<drfsupercenter> 03some phones have it built in so you don't need root
<Skylands> 10aScreenshot
<Skylands> 10Just found that in the market
<drfsupercenter> 03that one sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03it didn't even work for my phone LOL
<Skylands> 10Why?
<drfsupercenter> 03like it gave me complete green rectangles
<drfsupercenter> 03instead of screenshots
<drfsupercenter> 03so LOL
*Skylands checks reviews
<NightSeas> 12phones should just have a Prt Scrn button
*NightSeas runs
<drfsupercenter> 03I wish
<drfsupercenter> 03Android screenshots are actually really complicated
<drfsupercenter> 03it basically has to clear the screen then re-draw everything on it
<drfsupercenter> 03only it draws it to a png instead of the screen
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why, it's a bit obnoxious
<Xanbreon> Due to the security system
<drfsupercenter> 03that's still retarded
<Xanbreon> Normal apps cant touch eachother
<HyperMetalLugia> Well DRF
<NightSeas> 12I just go on paint and redraw everything myself instead
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but if fricking iPhones can have it built in
<drfsupercenter> 03so can Android
*NightSeas runs
<Xanbreon> ICS has it built in
<HyperMetalLugia> We're looking at a Linix kernel here, so of course it is going to be more retarded
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03does it?
<drfsupercenter> 03or is that just because you're using CM9
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<drfsupercenter> 03because CyanogenMod period has it built in
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Xanbreon> Yeh, cos the kernel totally has everything todo with the userland
<drfsupercenter> 03CM7 has it built in on my Droid 2
<drfsupercenter> 03HML
<drfsupercenter> 03you can use the printscreen button on Linux
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Xanbreon> Yes its built into ICS
<Xanbreon> Not just CM9
<drfsupercenter> 03seen any Motorolas with ICS yet?
<drfsupercenter> 03because IIRC
<drfsupercenter> 03the only ones that have ICS already
<Xanbreon> No clue
<drfsupercenter> 03are the brands that have built in screenshot regardless
<drfsupercenter> 03right?
<Xanbreon> Its built into the OS
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Xanbreon> Its built into AOSP
<Xanbreon> Srsly
<drfsupercenter> 03OK finally I got this to work
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/Ju1wd.jpg

<Skylands> 10You're more interesti- I mean floof
<Aurora> 6ok even I knew what XXX meant
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03and apparently
<Aurora> 6both definitions of it
<drfsupercenter> 03the name came from that beer company
<drfsupercenter> 03because
<drfsupercenter> 03X was a movie rating
<drfsupercenter> 03and XX was a brand of beer
<drfsupercenter> 03so they were forced to use 3
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Aurora> 6yep
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway Aurora, did you see the screenshot?
<Aurora> 6dos equis had it copyrighted

<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I can't even figure out a word from those letters
<drfsupercenter> 03let alone the picture
<drfsupercenter> 03hmm, I could use one of those scrabble cheating sites

<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Skylands> 10guys
<Skylands> 10my dad was standing behind me when XXX was being spoken of

<drfsupercenter> 03that it can give you
<Aurora> 6but I couldn't think of it
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's the easiest coin level
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf would you even draw for that LOL

<HyperMetalLugia> Did you tell her that her mother died?
*HyperMetalLugia trollfaces
<Skylands> 10now I'm reminded how much I dislike the taste of Pepsi
*Skylands just had something labelled
<Skylands> 10"Pepsi Next" in the fridge
<HyperMetalLugia> I can't taste the difference
<HyperMetalLugia> and I don't care
<HyperMetalLugia> Whiney americans and their soda world problems :<
<Skylands> 10uh
<Skylands> 10I don't like Pepsi OR Coke
<NightSeas> 12EW Pepsi

<drfsupercenter> 03soda ftw
<drfsupercenter> 03but ew cola
<Skylands> 10Lemonadeee
<NightSeas> 12caffeine*
<HyperMetalLugia> PINEPLAAPLE JUCIE
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<Skylands> 10I drink Moutain Dew, but even that gets old
<Skylands> 10Mountain
<drfsupercenter> 03Dr. Pepper is my favorite
<NightSeas> 12^
<Skylands> 10Dr. Pepper is too fizzy
<Skylands> 10IMO
<drfsupercenter> 03so is your face
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<Skylands> 10More fizz than there is drink
<Skylands> 10Jones soda is amazing though
<NightSeas> 12I don't like soda that's not fizzy XD
<Skylands> 10except nobody really knows of it
<Skylands> 10other than my friends and I
<drfsupercenter> 03I know what it is
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to buy huge stockpiles of Jones
<drfsupercenter> 03it was fricking expensive, but worth it
<HyperMetalLugia> everybody here loves Jones
<HyperMetalLugia> for some reason
<LuniesA> I don't like it
<Skylands> 10the price is what drags me away from buying it all the time
<LuniesA> I don't like fizzy drinks
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Skylands> 10Crystal Light lemonade plz
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I heard that stuff is horrible for you
<drfsupercenter> 03compared to real lemondae
<drfsupercenter> 03*nade
<drfsupercenter> 03like Minute Maid etc
<Skylands> 10how?
<HyperMetalLugia> Crystal Meth Lemonade
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<drfsupercenter> 03just some of the chemicals in it
<drfsupercenter> 03in order to make it "light"
<Skylands> 10Dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03same reason why they say diet pop is worse than regular pop
<drfsupercenter> 03no calories, but all the other crap is worse for you
<drfsupercenter> 03or osmething
<Skylands> 10orange juiceee
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't care, I drink it all XD
<Skylands> 10MBAM keeps detecing potentials for TST o.o
<Skylands> 10detecting*
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Corned beef pasty
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I has one
<Angel_Umbreon> 13even though it's past 1am
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I'm hungry
<Angel_Umbreon> 13therefore food is a requirement right now
*Angel_Umbreon eats
<Skylands> 10I know pasty means pastry, but...
*Skylands hides.
<Umbreon> candy bars
<drfsupercenter> 03:o
<HyperMetalLugia> IT IS A TRAP
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> not real feather
<drfsupercenter> 03prolly not, but random join is random
<Feather> 10how did you know
<HyperMetalLugia> ohmygoodness
<HyperMetalLugia> she talked
<HyperMetalLugia> can we trap her now?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03hi Feather :P
<Feather> 10hi XD
<Aurora> 6FEATHER MY LOVE.
<Ascendant> someone exists
<Ascendant> wow
<Drake> 04OH MY GOD FEATHER IS HERE
<Drake> 04NOW HOW CAN I TELL YOU AND SKYLANDS APART?
<Feather> 10AURORA MY LOVE
*Drake disappears
<Aurora> 6by looking at the first letter, duh
<Drake> 04But that's time-consuming
<Aurora> 6I guess yeah
<Drake> 04also bluh
<Drake> 04training for the E4 is such a pain in Emerald
<Drake> 04There are so few good training areas. Actually, THERE ARE NONE
<Aurora> 6lol exactly
<Aurora> 6except
<Drake> 04And since there's no Vs. Seeker in Emerald...
<Drake> 04Only that stupid match call system
<Aurora> 6level grinding is fairly easy in the end of victory road
<Aurora> 6it sucks with wild pokemon, but goes faster than you think
<Drake> 04Not when you're trying to train a SKARMORY
<Drake> 04Golbat> Run
<Drake> 04Aron> Run
<Drake> 04Lairon> Run
<Aurora> 6why?
<Drake> 04Graveler> Run
<Drake> 04Hariyama> FIGHT
<Aurora> 6it should have dominance over graveler
<Drake> 04Because Skarmory is slow and not very powerful
<Aurora> 6and fair well against golbats
<Drake> 04Golbats > Confuse Ray = OHMYGOD JUST ATTACK
<Aurora> 6ok well yeh
<Aurora> 6in that case, go grind at sky pillar
<NightSeas> 12Drake, PO now D:
<Drake> 04bah why
<NightSeas> 12I want to test out my new team :U
<Drake> 04fffffine

<Umbreon> i'd call myself crazy
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Umbreon> :<
<Umbreon> you need to get higher points
<Umbreon> to have a chance at getting the rarer pokemon
<Ascendant> urgh
<Ascendant> HML
<Ascendant> windows 7 is refusing to resize its partition
*Ascendant slaps
<Drake> 04Nightseas
<Drake> 04Sea
<Drake> 04See
<Ascendant> and mint is being a bastard as resizing it
<NightSeas> 12I need to work on that team :x
<Ascendant> at*
<Drake> 04Ferrothorn destroyed your Milotic because you made the mistake of using Dive
<Ascendant> NightSeas
<Drake> 04that's a physical move
<HyperMetalLugia> Weeind
<HyperMetalLugia> weird
<Ascendant> Don't go against Drake
<Drake> 04this Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet kick in
<Ascendant> you'll lose
<Drake> 04That's a compliment :'D
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Umbreon> hmm
<Aurora> 6i need to get some teams together for PO
<Aurora> 6sometime
<HyperMetalLugia> I never had problems with resizing partitions
<Aurora> 6possibly tonight
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Drake> 04But NS, I swept his team without a single Pokemon gone
<Umbreon> silly Drake
<Drake> 04I need to use my Linoone more often though
<Drake> 04Didn't get a chance to use him
<NightSeas> 12I made quite a few teams last night
<Ascendant> eh I lost my team
<Drake> 04I still have the giant broom if you want it NS :x
<NightSeas> 12derpteam.tp NS?
<NightSeas> 12I can give it back to you
<Ascendant> nah
<Ascendant> the one I used
<NightSeas> 12ah
<Drake> 04The one she used that kept kicking my @$$
<Ascendant> to thrash both of you
<Drake> 04Dat Togekiss
<Ascendant> hurr
<nickstr> yep
<nickstr> I have one
<NightSeas> 12I've been trying to make a good rain dance team
<nickstr> even if it does have the Hikari connection *shudders*
<Drake> 04Nightseas
<Drake> 04You used a MARILL
<NightSeas> 12:'D
<Aurora> 6dafuq
<NightSeas> 12butbut I like Marill :<
<Aurora> 6its all good lol
<Drake> 04Toxicroak against a Marill
<Drake> 04Toxicroak knows Thunderpunch
<Drake> 04OHKO!
<NightSeas> 12lmao
<Ascendant> Rain Dance teams
<Ascendant> I hate them so much
<Drake> 04hey
<Drake> 04Umbreon
<Drake> 04remember that Hail team you had?
<Drake> 04That thing was a pain
<Umbreon> i still have it
<Aurora> 6lol I should bring my glaceon out of storage
<Ascendant> hail teams are okay
<Drake> 04HEY AURORA
<Aurora> 6yep
<Drake> 04NINTALES WITH CONFUSE RAY, WILL-O-WISP AND DOUBLE TEAM
<Drake> 04IT KICKS @$$
<Umbreon> lol
<Aurora> 6Glaceon with snowbody- hail, blizzard (8), water pulse, toxic
<Aurora> 6*snow clock
<Umbreon> maybe i'm doing this training thing all wrong
<Umbreon> when i can't find a double battle to do
<Drake> 04Why Toxic?
<Umbreon> i should be doing singles to polish my skills at prediction
<Ascendant> cus' Toxic is good
<Ascendant> I should make a spikes team
<Drake> 04Skarmory is a must then
<Aurora> 6i'd never put glaceon out against a stell type unless forced to
<Drake> 04Aggron with Heavy Metal
<Aurora> 6toxic is for the fact I was training a team against 4 teams that had like two water types each
<Drake> 04Then Heavy Slam
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<Drake> 04holy crap Aggron has 180 base Defense
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Quanyails> 7But one Earth Power/Focus Blast and...
<Drake> 04I know
<Drake> 04but still
*Aurora 6points out that she hates competitive pokemon battling.
<Drake> 04Aurora
<Drake> 04on PO
<Drake> 04we really don't care
<Drake> 04We're just like "lol"
<Ascendant> Drake lol
<Quanyails> 7Drake, have you tried Rock Head Head Smash Aggron?
<Ascendant> I'm competitive but I don't really care that much
<Drake> 04Nope
<Drake> 04I've never used Aggron before
<Drake> 04NS
<Ascendant> oh god Aggron is normally really easy to kill
<Drake> 04I get my semi-competitiveness from you
<Quanyails> 7Think of Stone Edge x1.5.
*Quanyails 7is semi-competitive, mostly because of real-life tournaments. :P
<Drake> 04heh
<Drake> 04I only went srs because it's the only way to beat NS
<Drake> 04I could beat her for a time but now she destroys me
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Quanyails> 7Well, real-life stuff for me.
<Quanyails> 7Which means imperfect pokemon and stuff.
<Aurora> 6I like training pokemon, I like bonding with them
<Aurora> 6I use the pokemon I like
<Aurora> 6etc
<Aurora> 6I'm not overly competitive because the whole system of competitive battling is just crap
<Drake> 04Aurora
<Drake> 04why do you think I use Toxicroak?
<Aurora> 6same reason I use zweilous
<Ascendant> Why do you think I use Weavile?
<Drake> 04Why do you think I use Linoone?
<Quanyails> 7Ninetales. :/
<Drake> 04Shut up NS Weavile is badass
<Aurora> 6k I'm not attacking people's opinions, good lord
<Ascendant> exactly
<Ascendant> <3
<Quanyails> 7Only became competitively viable this generation. XD
<Quanyails> 7So that's unfortunate. D:
<Ascendant> yeah Ninetales sucked
<Ascendant> same with Arcanine
<Drake> 04heh
<Drake> 04Aurora
<Drake> 04Howsabout Flareon?
<Quanyails> 7Oh, poor Flareon.
<Aurora> 6flareon can be legitimately useful
<Aurora> 6apparently
<Quanyails> 7I've hoped for a Flare Blitz tutor. XD
<Drake> 04Yes
<Drake> 04it can
<Aurora> 6I'd like to exploit that
<Quanyails> 7And also be able to teach Terrakion that move. :U
<Aurora> 6a lot of effort, but yeah
<NightSeas> 12okay, got rid of Marill XD
<Aurora> 6flareon with flare blitz and rage, ftw
<Drake> 04Nightseas
<Drake> 04use soemthing that can exploit the rain
<Quanyails> 7Rage? X3
<Drake> 04Dry Skin, Swift Swim etc.
<NightSeas> 12yeah, I'll be using Dry Skin
<Drake> 04Toxicroak is now a water-wall for my team
<Quanyails> 7Well, no Drizzle + Swift Swim.
<Drake> 04Dry Skin + Thunderpunch
<Ascendant> Dry Skin is horrible
<Quanyails> 7Pfft, NS. :P
<NightSeas> 12that's why I always have one non-water type in my rain dance teams
<Ascendant> NightSeas, ever heard of hidden power?
<Quanyails> 7Dry Skin allows Jynx to stand up to Kyogre. XD
<NightSeas> 12yep
<Ascendant> And standard water team opening pokemon is Politoed
<Ascendant> Quanyails, I mean, I hate going against Dry Skin
<Ascendant> not using it
<Ascendant> and besides
<Ascendant> I like my team as it is
<Ascendant> I've beaten legendary teams with it
<Drake> 04I want
<Quanyails> 7Uber-tier legendaries?
<Drake> 04a Magikarp team
<NightSeas> 12^
<NightSeas> 12a Unown team!
<Drake> 04Nightseas
<Aurora> 6rage can be a fun move
<Drake> 04it is quite possible
<Aurora> 6it just sucks as a start
<Drake> 04to sweep a team of legendaries
<Drake> 04with Magikarp
<Aurora> 6one day
<Aurora> 6I will exploit that glitch
<Aurora> 6and get my flare blitz flareon
<Drake> 04I want an Aron team as well
<NightSeas> 12flail?
<Quanyails> 7Aron. :D
<Quanyails> 7If only if it was usable in Infrared... D:
<Quanyails> 7(Doesn't work since all pokemon are leveld to 50.
<Quanyails> 7)
<Drake> 04aww
<Quanyails> 7leveled*
<Quanyails> 7Fleebles.
<Ascendant> <Drake> I want an Aron team as well
<Ascendant> don't even go into that
<Quanyails> 7There are plenty of counters to it, though. X3
<Drake> 04like Magic Bounce
<Ascendant> Most teams don't have counters for it
<Quanyails> 7You mean Guard?
<Drake> 04w/e
<Ascendant> Magic Bounce doesn't counter it...?
<Ascendant> Magic Bounce is only for status effects
<Drake> 04that one Alakazam had
<Drake> 04that NS used to stop it one time
<Quanyails> 7Yep, Magic Guard.
<Aurora> 6magic guar
<Ascendant> Yeah
<Aurora> 6:|
<Ascendant> lol Alakazam
<Quanyails> 7Not too bad with its new ability.
<Quanyails> 7Still exceptionally frail.
<Ascendant> Frailty doesn't particularly matter when you have insane speed and special attack
<Quanyails> 7But Mold Breaker; Ground, Rock, and Steel-types, status, Knock Off, Trick...
<Umbreon> time to put Aurora to slepe again
<Ascendant> if you can get it set up properly and attacks don't miss, you're pretty good to go
<Drake> 04>priotity
<Drake> 04Sucker Punch, STAB Extremespeed...
<Ascendant> Steel and rock types get killed by Focus Blast
<Ascendant> Knock Off, normally the pokemon isn't fast enough to outspeed alakazam
<Aurora> 6nooooo
<Ascendant> Trick, destroy the psychic pokemon with Shadow Ball
<Quanyails> 7Well, that's a big 'if', NS.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homework-class-test-hipster-darwin-strikes-again1.jpg
<Ascendant> Quanyails, there's something called switching out
<Aurora> 6oh back in GSC
<Ascendant> Every pokemon is situational
<Aurora> 6espeon with bite, that was fun
<Quanyails> 7But some are more situational than others. :P
<Ascendant> Unless you're like me and get Dragon Dance +3
<Drake> 04LOL AURORA
<Ascendant> indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homework-class-test-and-copying-from-wikipedia-is-called-college.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03>:P
<Ascendant> Umbreon with Psychic, that was fun too
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Umbreon> lol
<Quanyails> 7ZAP CANNON ESPEON. :P
<Aurora> 6LOL I had zap cannon too
<Aurora> 6HGSS, replaced bite with shadow ball
<Aurora> 6still good to go
<Drake> 04I hated Zap Cannon
<Drake> 04can't hit anything :/
<Aurora> 6I had pretty awesome luck with zap cannon
<Drake> 04I loved Thunder's animation in GSC
<Ascendant> lmao Zap Cannon
<Aurora> 6forgot what it looked like
<Ascendant> porygon-z
<Ascendant> lock-on
<Ascendant> ZAP AWAY
<Ascendant> but that wastes a turn
<Ascendant> I hate dynamicpunch so much
<Quanyails> 7Whoo, 60 base damage per turn. X3
<Ascendant> every time someone used it
<Ascendant> IT KEPT HITTING ME
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> even though it has 50% accuracy
<Quanyails> 7Was it a Machamp?
<Aurora> 6what sucks is attract
<Drake> 04GOD
<Drake> 04DAMN
<Drake> 04IT
<Drake> 04ATTRACT
<Aurora> 6that move does not have 30% chance of immobility
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<Aurora> 6it's 30% chance of attacking :|
<Quanyails> 7At least genders can be set to avoid it.
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Drake> 04problem:
<Quanyails> 7I recall someone using Snow Cloak Froslass with Attract and Confuse Ray.
<Drake> 04You can't tell the gender of a pokemon before it's switched
<Drake> 04That's the problem
<Quanyails> 7?
<NightSeas> 12okay, another battle Drake? derp
<Drake> 04I hate Sweet Kiss
<Drake> 04bullccrap it has 75% accuracy
<Drake> 04more like 90%
<Drake> 04sure Nightseas
<NightSeas> 12alright
<Quanyails> 7Hey, same as Will-o-Wisp.

<Quanyails> 7Freeze.
<Quanyails> 7Easily. X3
<Aurora> 6i seem to have good luck with freeze
<Quanyails> 7Toxic is second.
<Aurora> 6except that one time my level 100 arceus was frozen pretty much the entire battle
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<Aurora> 6almost lost to a level6- something
<Aurora> 6*60
<Ascendant> wait what
<Ascendant> since when did Haii get in here?
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6hours ago
<Ascendant> When I wasn't on
<Ascendant> okay
<Quanyails> 7Not too bothersome.
<Ascendant> hopefully not
<Aurora> 6chill guys
<Aurora> 6seriously.
<Ascendant> Huh?
<drfsupercenter> 03...I smell smoke
<drfsupercenter> 03around here, that's not usually good
<drfsupercenter> 03hopefully the place isn't on fire
<Ascendant> drffffffffffffffffffff
<Ascendant> windows 7 is being a bastard
<Ascendant> and not resizing its partition
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why
<drfsupercenter> 03you clean install
<drfsupercenter> 03for the 50th time
<drfsupercenter> 03what I do
<drfsupercenter> 03is
<drfsupercenter> 03parted magic
<drfsupercenter> 03make partitions to size
<drfsupercenter> 03then install Win7 to the NTFS partition I already made
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Ascendant> I'm using gparted
<drfsupercenter> 03yheah same idea
<drfsupercenter> 03-
<drfsupercenter> 03*-h
<drfsupercenter> 03Parted Magic uses gparte
<drfsupercenter> 03d
<Ascendant> derp
<NightSeas> 12fuuu-
<Ascendant> downloading it atm
<Ascendant> I went through 4 CDs yesterday
<Ascendant> before I finally made a working copy of mint 12
<NightSeas> 12I will beat you one of these years Drake >:@
<Drake> 04XD
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL CDs
<Drake> 04Toxicroak keeps sweeping you
<Drake> 04You need ice moves or something
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't have a flash drive to spare?
<NightSeas> 12yep XD
<drfsupercenter> 03XBoot is like the single most useful thing I've discovered, ever
<drfsupercenter> 03it lets you pile ISO upon ISO onto a flash drive
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03the only ones you can't do are Windows installers, ironically.
<drfsupercenter> 03but anything else

<NightSeas> 12I was going to use Psychic on it, but Toxicroak was too fast
<Aurora> 6that animation ohhhhhhmygoooooood
<Quanyails> 7I KNOW THAT ONE.
<Quanyails> 7It's on dA>
<Quanyails> 7Sorta.

<Aurora> 6and dance fortress 2 has some amazing 3D animation onfbcg
<Quanyails> 7Aye at the latter.

<Drake> 04cya
<NightSeas> 12seeya
<drfsupercenter> 03Lunch break at 6PM? LOL
<Quanyails> 7Methinks you need a physical wall, NightSeas.
<NightSeas> 12I probably do
<Drake> 04he's using a Rain Dance Team without a Drizzle Politoad
<NightSeas> 12I probably do*
<Quanyails> 7Dusclops can hamper it with Will-o-Wisp.
<Quanyails> 7And is immune to Drain Punch, if Lyon runs that.
<Drake> 04Nope
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Drake> 04Brick Break, X-Scissor, Thunderpunch and Sucker Punch
<Quanyails> 7No boosting move?
<Drake> 04No need. I use Toxicroak as a priority-abusing most of the time
<Quanyails> 7What does X-Scissor hit that Brick Break and Sucker Punch don't? o.o
<Quanyails> 7Grasses/
<Quanyails> 7?
<NightSeas> 12I'm going to take a break from my rain dance team. XD
<Drake> 04Thunderpunch/Brick Break/X-Scissor then Sucker Punch
<Drake> 04pretty much
<Drake> 04since it has a Focus Sash
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Quanyails> 7And why not Drain Punch over Brick Break?
<Quanyails> 7Unless you do like breaking screens. :P
<Drake> 04I have had bad experience with Reflect
<Drake> 04But wait
<Drake> 04Garchomp has Brick Break
<Quanyails> 7Garchomp? X3
<Drake> 04yah
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so
<Quanyails> 7Using it in your games?
<drfsupercenter> 03this video entitled "What Girls Do in the Shower"
<drfsupercenter> 03started out really funny
<drfsupercenter> 03and then got weird
<drfsupercenter> 03and no it's not nsfw
<drfsupercenter> 03it's on youtube
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04OH
<Drake> 04Quan
<NightSeas> 12;3
<Drake> 04It can't learn Drain Punch
<Quanyails> 7 4th Gen tutor.
<Quanyails> 7Or TM.
<Quanyails> 7Dah.
<Quanyails> 7Third time I've made that error.
<Quanyails> 7Twice in real life dialogue. o_o
<Drake> 04XD
<Quanyails> 7First time, I suppose, in chat.
<Drake> 04It can only learn Drain Punch via Breeding
<Drake> 04apparently
<Quanyails> 7And 4th gen. TM./
<Drake> 04And then Thunderpunch requires a 4Gen Tutor...
<Drake> 04wait
<Quanyails> 7Yeep.
<Drake> 04ah well
<Drake> 04Brick Break works
<Quanyails> 7If this is simulated battle, I don't suppose you can just make that modification.
<Drake> 04meh
<Drake> 04cbf
<Quanyails> 7Really? :U
<Drake> 04I'll live without it.
<Quanyails> 7Okay. :P
<Drake> 04It's not all that important
<Drake> 04I just wish
<Drake> 04Toxicroak could learn Close Combat
<Quanyails> 7Well, there's Cross Chop.
<Quanyails> 7Strongest it can get.
<Ascendant> Cross Chop is pretty good
<Drake> 04>Breeding
<Drake> 04Plus it doesn't have 100 accuracy
<Drake> 04I'd rather not rely on luck
<Drake> 04and the Random Number Gods have never been kind to me
<NightSeas> 12Okay, I’m going to use a older team I revised now
<Drake> 04yeah well
<Drake> 04challenge NS
<Drake> 04I'm playing Emerald :I
<NightSeas> 12alright
<Ascendant> Drake
<NightSeas> 12NS :D
<Ascendant> it has good enough accuracy
<Ascendant> I don't have PO or a team
<Quanyails> 7Stone Edge, basically. :P
<Drake> 04ohright
<Drake> 04duh
*Drake facepalms
<Ascendant> I might have a team but I haven't downloaded PO and I'm still trying to set up stuff
<Drake> 04Quan I hate Stone Edge
<Drake> 04Like I said
<Drake> 04RNG hates me
<NightSeas> 12derp
<Quanyails> 7Yep, but it's a standard.
<Quanyails> 7And yes, I hate Stone Edge misses, too.
<Drake> 04if I cared about standards I wouldn't even be using Toxicroak
<Quanyails> 7I suppose.
*Quanyails 7does. X.x
<Drake> 04XD
<Quanyails> 7Because you can actually win something in real life. XD
<Drake> 04Hell, I wouldn't be using Linoone
<Quanyails> 7My friend won a poster--that 'pokermon' image.
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> OH DRAKE
<Quanyails> 7So yeah. :P
<Ascendant> THAT REMINDS ME
<Drake> 04?
<Quanyails> 7Which is why I'm less inclined for lolsome games. :/
<Ascendant> I haven't played pokemon in ages
<Quanyails> 7The physical games?
<Eon|away> /nick Eon

<Ascendant> what the flying
<Ascendant> >windows 7
<Ascendant> >copy iso to external HDD
<Ascendant> "You need administrative privileges to copy files to this drive"
<Ascendant> WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM
<HyperMetalLugia> How about
<HyperMetalLugia> you just turn off UAC
<HyperMetalLugia> go to cmd
<HyperMetalLugia> and do all the ATRIB stuffs
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> attrib /? yayish
<Ascendant> I just did it via cmd
<Ascendant> huh?
<Ascendant> UAC?
<Ascendant> oh
<Ascendant> that thing
<Ascendant> lol I failed to turn that off
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes or No prompt
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Ascendant> yeah
*Ascendant goes to look for it
<Ascendant> I think I'm already starting to like XP better
<HyperMetalLugia> well
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> where do you disable UAC?
*Ascendant too lazy to look
<HyperMetalLugia> just windows key, type user acc + enter
<HyperMetalLugia> at the bottom
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<HyperMetalLugia> The control panel's "small view' is sooo helpful
<Ascendant> I lol'd
<Ascendant> I tried setting the UAC thing to Never Notify
<Ascendant> and then it comes up with a pop-up
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03that's better than Vista
<drfsupercenter> 03which made you reboot
<Ascendant> "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer?"
*Ascendant lol'd
<Ascendant> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03well Ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a perfectly good reason for it asking you
<Ascendant> You must restart your computer to turn off UAC
*Ascendant stabs
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03it hates you
<drfsupercenter> 03no but see
<drfsupercenter> 03UAC is basically the same as
<drfsupercenter> 03"restrict non-admins from doing this{"
<drfsupercenter> 03so on domains, e.g. my school
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet
<HyperMetalLugia> You're a friggin admin
<Ascendant> screw UAC
<drfsupercenter> 03it prevents students from turning off UAC
*HyperMetalLugia raeg
<drfsupercenter> 03see what I mean? :P
<Ascendant> just konboot and get the admin pass
<Ascendant> then hack the hell out of the school network
<HyperMetalLugia> konboot?
<HyperMetalLugia> :C
<Ascendant> whatever
<Ascendant> I'm restarting anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant
<Ascendant> burning gparted
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a NETWORK PASSWORD
<Ascendant> yeah I know
<drfsupercenter> 03so something like ophcrack is useless
<Ascendant> I was being sarcastic
<Ascendant> not particularly
<Ascendant> you bruteforce the network login
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03good luck with that
<HyperMetalLugia> If only the LAN room wasn't locked with a digitpad
<Ascendant> yeah I know
<Ascendant> what you do
<Ascendant> you infect the network with a trojan virus
<drfsupercenter> 03social engineering.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Ascendant> then use all of them to bruteforce
<Ascendant> as one botnet
<Ascendant> ???
<Ascendant> PROFIT
<HyperMetalLugia> the best botnet is when Mcaffe is installed
<HyperMetalLugia> they secretly think it works
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Ascendant> lol mcaffee
<Ascendant> I have no AV installed on my new computer
<Ascendant> I need to get spybot
<Ascendant> or just get AVG
<Ascendant> AVG is good for the simple things
<drfsupercenter> 03meh AVG
<Ascendant> and isn't as anal about getting in the way as norton is
<drfsupercenter> 03get MBAM
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwut
<Ascendant> I uninstalled norton
<drfsupercenter> 03EW NORTON
<drfsupercenter> 03EWWWWWWWWWWWW
<Ascendant> exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03get MBAM"
<HyperMetalLugia> Why would Ascendant need anti-virus anyway?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03for when she downloads porn
<drfsupercenter> 03that turns out to be viruses
<Drake> "You were once pulled screaming out of a woman's <censored>. I don't know why you're acting so dignified."
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 12 time(s).
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
*Drake afks now
<Ascendant> what
*Ascendant feels cold
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> my DET laptop has been online for 4days 18hrs 58mins 32secs
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03for a second
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought you were going to ask him to go light your fire

<HyperMetalLugia> My mother's Vista PC usually stays up for 3 or so weeks sometimes
<HyperMetalLugia> I swear, even though it's Vista, it is stable :|
<HyperMetalLugia> After I fixed it BSOD every 10 hours before
<Kimori> yo
<Kjakings> 7I'm off.
<Kjakings> 7night all.
<Kjakings> 7oh, and dari: she's pretty hot too :P
<Ascendant> lol oops I think I just formatted windows' pagefile partition
<Ascendant> oh well
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean System Reserved?
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/fGxbW.jpg
<Ascendant> yeah I think I just deleted it
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't actually need that
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<HyperMetalLugia> Good going
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows won't boot without it
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<Ascendant> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03you can install it without it
*Ascendant sighs
<drfsupercenter> 03it's really stupid and the reason I partition before installing
<drfsupercenter> 03System Reserved just has some recovery crap if your computer won't boot
<drfsupercenter> 03but the disc also has that
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> I remembered the day
<drfsupercenter> 03just use gparted, delete the entire drive
<HyperMetalLugia> I first did a clean install
<drfsupercenter> 03make NTFS partition
<drfsupercenter> 03make extw/e for Linux
<drfsupercenter> 03then install Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03then install Linux so you get the dualboot thing
<drfsupercenter> 03profit?
<NightSeas> 12[20:00] <%drfsupercenter> http://i.imgur.com/fGxbW.jpg <-- LOL
<Ascendant> how long
<Ascendant> does it take to install windows?
<drfsupercenter> 0330 mins
<drfsupercenter> 03roughly
<Xanbreon> More if you have a slow hdd
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 0330-45
<drfsupercenter> 03it's much faster than XP though
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03mainly because of hte formatting
<HyperMetalLugia> My laptop
<Ascendant> well fine
<HyperMetalLugia> hmm..
<drfsupercenter> 03XP is just as fast I suppose if you preformat
<Ascendant> I'll completely reinstall 7
<Xanbreon> Good jorb NS you derp
<Ascendant> that means I need to redo my tweaking
<Ascendant> whatever
<HyperMetalLugia> Took like 2 hours with an OEM disl,
<Ascendant> urgh
<HyperMetalLugia> well
<HyperMetalLugia> Less than 2 hours
<Ascendant> I need to burn windows to a DVD, don't I?
<HyperMetalLugia> eeeyup.
<drfsupercenter> 03or use a flash drive
<HyperMetalLugia> No copypasta
<drfsupercenter> 03flash drive is faster
<drfsupercenter> 03if you have a 4+GB one
<drfsupercenter> 03that you can wipe
<HyperMetalLugia> ORLY?!
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<HyperMetalLugia> I really need a 4GB flash drive then
<drfsupercenter> 03installing Windows 7 from a flash drive is like, you can do it in 20 mins XD
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> blah
<Ascendant> I have 2 unallocated partitions
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually have a designated Win7 Pro x64 flash drive
<Ascendant> how2merge?
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03just
<drfsupercenter> 03DELETE EVERYTHING
<drfsupercenter> 03and start over
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not rocket science
<drfsupercenter> 03in fact, just do Create partition table
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Ascendant> fiiiine
<HyperMetalLugia> But DRF
<Ascendant> ;_;
<HyperMetalLugia> She'll loose NORTON!!!
<HyperMetalLugia> Files
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03*losew
<drfsupercenter> 03-w
<drfsupercenter> 03not loose
<drfsupercenter> 03loose is an adjective
<drfsupercenter> 03:|
<Ascendant> as soon as I finish copying the iso to your public_html
<drfsupercenter> 03you haven't downloaded it yet? o.o
<Ascendant> it's 3GB
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought you said you had it o.o
<Ascendant> it's STILL COPYING
<Ascendant> nope
<drfsupercenter> 03why copy
<drfsupercenter> 03just move
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Ascendant> same time though
<NightSeas> 12derp. been busy with school work all day .-.
<drfsupercenter> 03not realy
<drfsupercenter> 03moving is instant
<Ascendant> orly?
<drfsupercenter> 03copying actually creates a copy
<drfsupercenter> 03derp
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes.
<drfsupercenter> 03at least it SHOULd be
<Ascendant> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL how did you not know that
<drfsupercenter> 03moving a file is usually instant
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's on the same drive
<drfsupercenter> 03it's only when you move between drives that it takes just as long
<Ascendant> it's not instant ):
<NightSeas> 12ah, so I should talk to Stormy? I guess I could ask for her help XD
<drfsupercenter> 03then ext3 or whatever it is sucks horribly
<Xanbreon> On all sane file systems it should be
<drfsupercenter> 03it's darn near instant on Windows
<Ascendant> well it's done now
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Kimori> Are you on the forums?
<drfsupercenter> 03and by Windows I mean NTFS
<drfsupercenter> 03and FAT32, too
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay Fat32
<HyperMetalLugia> Fat16 can die
<HyperMetalLugia> Sloowly
<Xanbreon> for example on ext3/4 it wont actually move anything, just update where the file is
<Xanbreon> FAT32 is a PoS
<Xanbreon> And should die in a fire
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I use it for flash drives still
<drfsupercenter> 03as LOL UNIVERSALL COMPATIBLE
<Ascendant> fff
<drfsupercenter> 03NTFS can cause issues
<Ascendant> what is the damn url to your stupid public_html
<Xanbreon> NTFS is a pretty crappy filesystem
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not public_html
<drfsupercenter> 03it has to be in var/www
<drfsupercenter> 03and you need sudo to move it
<Ascendant> -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03this
<drfsupercenter> 03is why
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate linux
<Ascendant> oh yeah apache
<HyperMetalLugia> At least we have decent file restore programs
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<Xanbreon> Why are you not in the www-data group?
<Xanbreon> derps
<drfsupercenter> 03I have no idea
<drfsupercenter> 03I was just setting it up quickly so Sky/HML could download a movie
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Xanbreon> ext have good file recovery programs
<drfsupercenter> 03never seen one, never heard of one working o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03GetDataBack for NTFS is like the single best thing ever made
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a FAT version too
<Ascendant> this
<Ascendant> is going to take forever
<HyperMetalLugia> HFS+ best filesystem evah :D
<Ascendant> downloading at 1mbps
<Xanbreon> Then whoever was using the ext recovery program was a derp
<HyperMetalLugia> Waitasec
<HyperMetalLugia> if Ext only updates the position of the file instead of moving the data
<HyperMetalLugia> What happens if the file is in a bad sector and you try to move it to a folder that might have a better sector :o
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<drfsupercenter> 03HML/ Xanbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03I noticed the weirdest thing ever
<drfsupercenter> 03that's really bugging me
<drfsupercenter> 03you know that seagate that broke and had a couple files I needed on it?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeaah
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Did it break the recovery program?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep
<drfsupercenter> 03OK like'
<drfsupercenter> 03ever heard of SpinRite?
<Xanbreon> If the data is on a bad sector, its screwed anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03here's the thing
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried SpinRite on another broken drive
<drfsupercenter> 03it would get to the broken part
<drfsupercenter> 03attempt to recover it
<drfsupercenter> 03then error
<NightSeas> 12yep /late
<drfsupercenter> 03and go "nope, sorry, can't fix it"
<drfsupercenter> 03on this drive
<drfsupercenter> 03it literally STOPS
<drfsupercenter> 03it just, full stop
<HyperMetalLugia> Bada** drive :<
<drfsupercenter> 03hits about 48% and just stops the stupid thing
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03the timer keeps going
<drfsupercenter> 03it's supposedly still reading data
<Xanbreon> Then the drive is totally screwed
<drfsupercenter> 03but if you look at the live snapshot of data being read
<drfsupercenter> 03it's frozen
<drfsupercenter> 03after about a day
<drfsupercenter> 03it got another 1% done
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but what I dont'get
<drfsupercenter> 03is why does it literally stop the programs
<Kimori> well it would be good to have more here
<drfsupercenter> 03rather then them go "Uh, can't read this, bad sector!"
<HyperMetalLugia> I remember when that happened
<drfsupercenter> 03same thing happens with scandisk, even the fast one
<Kimori> but I think the harder part is keeping them here
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll get to about 48% and just STOP
<HyperMetalLugia> to an old ATA/IDE maxtor drive
<HyperMetalLugia> it froze up my windows so badly
<drfsupercenter> 03and cancelling the scandisk was what caused me to lose that 20GB TV recording >:@
<drfsupercenter> 03now it shows up as a 0 byte file
<Xanbreon> Might be the heads that are broken
<drfsupercenter> 03since scandisk had it "locked"
<NightSeas> 12true
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe you could make a full partition copy trololol
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I might try to run DBAN, but only after I'm 100% sure I can't get my crap back :/
<drfsupercenter> 03because right now, SpinRite *is* still going, just very very very very very slowly
<drfsupercenter> 03like LOL taking an entire week for one drive
<Ascendant> Hm
<Xanbreon> Sleep time
<Xanbreon> Night
<HyperMetalLugia> make sure you have UPS
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drfsupercenter> 03nah, I make sure I have FedEx
*drfsupercenter runs

*drfsupercenter stabs MicroSD cards
<drfsupercenter> 03these files are copying at like 8MB/sec
<drfsupercenter> 03usually the *read* speeds are really good
<HyperMetalLugia> Whoa
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's the *write* speed that's slow
<drfsupercenter> 03yay taking close to an hour >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> My silly cards usually like
<HyperMetalLugia> actually
<drfsupercenter> 03to copy the contents of my old phone's MicroSD to my computer
*HyperMetalLugia tests his 4GB class 2
<HyperMetalLugia> er
<HyperMetalLugia> CLASS 6.
<drfsupercenter> 03OH GOD CLASS 2
<drfsupercenter> 03good
<drfsupercenter> 03this one's a class 4
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's also 32GB
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm getting like 7.5MB/S write speed using chkflash
<Umbreon> darnit NightSeas
<Umbreon> not very many options XD
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm talking about *read* speed
<drfsupercenter> 03not write speed
<drfsupercenter> 03read speed is usually much faster
<HyperMetalLugia> i'm testing that next
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm copying actual fiels LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03*files
<drfsupercenter> 03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/funny-graphs-probably-the-first-person-to-lose-a-limb-with-one-too.jpg <- if ony
<drfsupercenter> 03*only
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually asked my physics teacher once if lightsabers are physically possible. True story
<drfsupercenter> 03He had these random discussion periods when there was nothing to teach so he let us just have "educated" physics discussions
<drfsupercenter> 03best class I ever had in high school IMO
<drfsupercenter> 03wait,w hy did I even say IMO, that's implied o_O
<HyperMetalLugia> 7.8 MB/S write
<HyperMetalLugia> yay silly
<drfsupercenter> 03that's
<drfsupercenter> 03actually not bad for a class 6
<drfsupercenter> 03as technically
<drfsupercenter> 03it only needs to be 6MB/sec
<HyperMetalLugia> but it does like 500kb/S for a ton of small files
<Umbreon> gah NightSeas
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03that's true of any medium
<HyperMetalLugia> But yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03even solid states
<Umbreon> why does the only pokemon who can learn helping hands
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows 7 is a *bit* better at that, but it still has issues
<drfsupercenter> 03hence
<Umbreon> and possibly survive the attack at the sametime
<drfsupercenter> 03why if I have tons of small files
<drfsupercenter> 03I just winrar them LOL
<Umbreon> not have any dark type moves
<HyperMetalLugia> Getting an average of 7.4-7.8
<HyperMetalLugia> so not bad.
<Umbreon> to shoe away any ghost types

<HyperMetalLugia> ooh
<HyperMetalLugia> 16.4 MB/S read speed
<HyperMetalLugia> decent little thing
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<drfsupercenter> 03that's twice as fast as mine's going x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> go use chkflsh
<HyperMetalLugia> and test your card
<HyperMetalLugia> and see how it compares :<
<drfsupercenter> 03when I'm done copying craptons of data
<drfsupercenter> 03I have like 20GB of stuff to copy

<drfsupercenter> 03wait, really?
<drfsupercenter> 03just randomly?
<Umbreon> it was thown up on stage i think if i heard correctly
<Umbreon> ozzy picked it up and took a bite out of it
<drfsupercenter> 03how does one throw a live bat
<Umbreon> his side of the story was he thought it was a fake bat
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03and there's no video of this?
<Umbreon> but i don't know how you can honestly not tell the two apart
<Umbreon> PETA probably erased them all
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Umbreon> but i don't know how you can honestly not tell the two apart
<Umbreon> unless you were super high
<Umbreon> and we both know ozzy had that wild side
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03speaking of which

<HyperMetalLugia> Heey
<drfsupercenter> 03but I love that camera, new ones are too flimsy
<HyperMetalLugia> I thaught

<drfsupercenter> 03anyway though HML
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera is on a cruise all week, right? (Lucky SOB)

<NightSeas> 12the worst trolls don't let you troll :<
<NightSeas> 12I figured out how to DDOS for fun today. (I didn’t do anything btw) XD
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't even know how to DDOS
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't *want* to know
<drfsupercenter> 03because some people just assume that I'm some pro hacker because I'm good at computers
<NightSeas> 12I just wanted to know for some reason
<drfsupercenter> 03so not knowing how to is the best defense XC
<drfsupercenter> 03*XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Nightseas
<HyperMetalLugia> Be a genius
<NightSeas> 12what is this HML
<HyperMetalLugia> and DDOS 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.1 plz
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<NightSeas> 12I'm already a genius >:@

<NightSeas> 12:|
<HyperMetalLugia> You'll take down the internet
<HyperMetalLugia> Really!!
<NightSeas> 12I would be DDOSing myself LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> But
<HyperMetalLugia> You'll take down the internet!
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<NightSeas> 12But really, it’s just code that you combine with their IP in command prompt that massive pings the server to death
<NightSeas> 12Causes it to crash
<NightSeas> 12Of course, that would take days of DDOSing, and then you would get put in prison XD

<HyperMetalLugia> Hi
<HyperMetalLugia> I am back
<HyperMetalLugia> from internet died
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I was the guy who provided everybody with proxies, right
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<NightSeas> 12derp
<drfsupercenter> 03one day I get called down to the office
<drfsupercenter> 03they had a fricking cop
<drfsupercenter> 03and the principal
<NightSeas> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and the director of IT for the school district
<drfsupercenter> 03I could tell it was serious business
<HyperMetalLugia> ohmy
<drfsupercenter> 03they're like
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<HyperMetalLugia> U gonna get slammed?>
<drfsupercenter> 03"SO there's a rumor going around that a group ofp eople hacked everybody's password and had a 'master list' somewhere. Do you know anything about this?"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like um, no
<drfsupercenter> 03as I honestly hadn't
<drfsupercenter> 03and they were like "well, 4 separate people told us you might know who's responsible"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like "wait, what? 4 peopel gave my name?" "Yep"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like ...
<drfsupercenter> 03Just because I gave them a way to bypass the filter
<drfsupercenter> 03does not know I know how tos teal password
<drfsupercenter> 03*mean
<drfsupercenter> 03-_-
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03that meeting was so awkward
<drfsupercenter> 03I was in there for like an hour
<drfsupercenter> 03being questioned
<drfsupercenter> 03have you ever done this, this, this
<drfsupercenter> 03at one point I told the guy
<drfsupercenter> 03"Look, honestly, I'm all talk. I have no idea how to "hack" anything. The worst I've done is just bypass the filter a few time"
<drfsupercenter> 03*s
<drfsupercenter> 03and he's like "well that's good, you don't want to go that route"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like "oh, I know, I'm ethical"
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the same reason I refuse to accept money for my bootleg copies of stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03even if it's just repayment or a thank-you donation
<HyperMetalLugia> If that happened to me
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't care, I won't take it
<SheenaFox> um
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<NightSeas> 12well, it's actually pretty easy to make a proxy compared to hacker stuff XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I would just say "I dislike censorship and I prefer to increase my productivity by using my own methods of work!"
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas that's my point
<SheenaFox> hi?
<drfsupercenter> 03and I didn't even MAKE the proxy
<drfsupercenter> 03I just found the
<drfsupercenter> 03m
<drfsupercenter> 03ever heard of Peacefire?
<NightSeas> 12nope
<drfsupercenter> 03and SheenaFox, you're the one who said "um" :P
<drfsupercenter> 03well NightSeas, it's basically a mailing list for proxies
<drfsupercenter> 03they usually use two ordinary words
<NightSeas> 12ah
<drfsupercenter> 03like, for example, squirrel tree
<drfsupercenter> 03or something
<drfsupercenter> 03and just make it .com
<drfsupercenter> 03so that way it's not obvious
<drfsupercenter> 03cuz, you know, the early proxies (for example, 4proxy.com was the first one I used) were like "um, it has the word proxy in it, ban"
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway, the thing is
<drfsupercenter> 03you go to one of the peacefire proxies
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a form at the bottom to sign up for their mailing list
<drfsupercenter> 03that way when they get blocked, you get an email with a new one
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03that's basically all I did LOL
<NightSeas> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so
<drfsupercenter> 03<HyperMetalLugia> I would just say "I dislike censorship and I prefer to increase my productivity by using my own methods of work!"
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't finish
<drfsupercenter> 03after the cop left
<drfsupercenter> 03and it was just me and the IT admin
<drfsupercenter> 03he was like "you said you bypassed the proxy? What made you think you had the right to do that?"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like "Because your stupid filtering system blocked everything left and right and I had actual research to do about handguns for a speech and couldn't do it?"
<drfsupercenter> 03and he was like "The stuff we blocked is blocked for a reason. You aren't supposed to be doing that at school"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like "Um, no? It's as if someone just took the master list and blocked them all without actually hand-checking the sites, which is stupid and lots of legitimate sites were blocked that souldn't have been"
<drfsupercenter> 03he's like "Well, being that person who's in charge of the proxy, I assure you that's not true"
<drfsupercenter> 03I go "Oh really then? Then why is my own personal server with nothing bad on it blocked for porn?"
<drfsupercenter> 03dead silence for about a minute
<drfsupercenter> 03then he goes "Thanks for talking, you're free to go"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was laughing so hard when I got out of there
<HyperMetalLugia> ouch.
<HyperMetalLugia> You trolled him good
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep
<drfsupercenter> 03to this day I have never heard from them again :P
<drfsupercenter> 03they were all
<drfsupercenter> 03"I know you're graduating soon but we have your contact info if we get more reports that you know anything about this"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03nope, never heard from them
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah, those were the days
<drfsupercenter> 03Get this
<drfsupercenter> 03Earlier today, Iw as freaking out because my password didn't work, I thought I had been banned or something (from the university PCs)
<drfsupercenter> 03then I was like "derp, they forced me to change my password, that's right"
<NightSeas> 12I hate forced passwork changes XD
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03I found a way around it
<NightSeas> 12password*
<drfsupercenter> 03it weas like "cannot repeat any of your previous 5 password"
<drfsupercenter> 03*s
<drfsupercenter> 03OK fine, challenge accepted
<drfsupercenter> 03so I change it to
<drfsupercenter> 03temp1
<drfsupercenter> 03temp2
<drfsupercenter> 03temp3
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<drfsupercenter> 03then change it back
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Good idea
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<NightSeas> 12and I thought I was the only one who did that
<HyperMetalLugia> We can't change passwords on demand so.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;<
<drfsupercenter> 03what I fricking hate
<drfsupercenter> 03is what Windows considers secure passwords
<drfsupercenter> 03>must be at least 8 characters
<drfsupercenter> 03My usual password is 7
<drfsupercenter> 03RAGE
<NightSeas> 12my usual password is 12
<drfsupercenter> 03well mine's 7 LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I want to figure out if there's a way to get around the thing
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe using a VPN
<HyperMetalLugia> 10 for me
<drfsupercenter> 03Since it had that issue before
<drfsupercenter> 03HML you might like this
<HyperMetalLugia> I AM THE MIDDLE PERCENT
<drfsupercenter> 03our school is odd
<drfsupercenter> 03and has two passwords
<drfsupercenter> 03one for Windows only
<drfsupercenter> 03the other for the Linux systems, email, the school control panel, etc
<NightSeas> 12but some sites want your password to be something like: 54%^54g;'{[0-\`~@13fgr54t$%64554
*NightSeas runs
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03both of them were set to some stupid pasword originally
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows is easy to change, it's like 8 characters or more, that's all
<drfsupercenter> 03well the other one
<drfsupercenter> 03I log into my email
<drfsupercenter> 03go to change it
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like "You must have: at least one letter, number, and symbol"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like >:@
<HyperMetalLugia> Returrded
<drfsupercenter> 03well we had a lab class where we used Linux systems
<drfsupercenter> 03I go in there
<HyperMetalLugia> ew.
<drfsupercenter> 03do passwd
<drfsupercenter> 03and change it
<HyperMetalLugia> I would hate that class
<drfsupercenter> 03to my usual "unsafe" passweord
<drfsupercenter> 03-e
<NightSeas> 12EW symbols in passwords
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drfsupercenter> 03it didn't whine
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03so I now have a gmail password
<drfsupercenter> 03that is only 7 chars long
<drfsupercenter> 03umad?
<drfsupercenter> 03gmail requires 8+
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm special
<NightSeas> 127? All my passwords are even numbers XD
<NightSeas> 12like 6, 10 and 12
<drfsupercenter> 03it's 7.
<drfsupercenter> 03Don't ask why
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had that password since second grade
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'll be d***ed if some stupid new rules are going to make me change it
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<NightSeas> 12XD
<NightSeas> 12I've had mine since 4th grade
<NightSeas> 12your password should be drfsupercenter
*NightSeas hides
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 His password is DanielF
*HyperMetalLugia dies
<HyperMetalLugia> I've never had a set password though
<HyperMetalLugia> Every single school used a different password.
<drfsupercenter> 03-_-
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway though
<drfsupercenter> 03the reason I was able to get away with it
<NightSeas> 12HML, what's your password? :D
<drfsupercenter> 03is that the school migrated to gmail after I had already set the password on their Java email system
<drfsupercenter> 03and it just copied the apsswords over
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<NightSeas> 12my password is derpherphurr
*NightSeas hides
<HyperMetalLugia> I keep a text file of all my passwords
<HyperMetalLugia> Or should I say
<HyperMetalLugia> My previous passwords
<NightSeas> 12I bet if it was something suggestive no one would be able to guess :D
*NightSeas runs
<HyperMetalLugia> we change them ever 4 months :|
<NightSeas> 12unless it's a new password, I never write mine down
<NightSeas> 12and that's only if it's a password to server,etc
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03I try to use my same password everywhere
<drfsupercenter> 03I know that's supposedly unsafe
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's not like anybody actually nkows it
<drfsupercenter> 03*kjnows
<drfsupercenter> 03-j
<NightSeas> 12and it's also not like anyone knows everywhere you've been XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Nightseas is a plotholes
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03you can basically assume that drfsupercenter is me LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03on any site it's registered
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03except AIM for some reason.
<drfsupercenter> 03AIM wouldn't let me use that name
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<NightSeas> 12like, if someone got your ebay password, how would they know you're a member on TST,etc
<HyperMetalLugia> maybe you afren't the deal DRF
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03by just using that username derp
<drfsupercenter> 03as in
<drfsupercenter> 03if I hacked an account named NightSeas
<drfsupercenter> 03and then I googled NightSeas
<drfsupercenter> 03I could just figure it out
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<NightSeas> 12true XD
<NightSeas> 12cookie dough ice cream <3
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL that reminds me of this one failbook quote

<drfsupercenter> 03er, I already spammed that one
<drfsupercenter> 03well I have all 6, either way :p
<Ascendant> drf
<Ascendant> what about the drivers?
<drfsupercenter> 03hp.com
<Ascendant> urgh
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly
<drfsupercenter> 03all you should need
<drfsupercenter> 03is the video card
<drfsupercenter> 03everything else should just work
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe the wifi, but my wifi worked fine
<Ascendant> well, what do I do? Download the drivers?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Ascendant> before I install or after?
<drfsupercenter> 03I love how incompetent you are with Windows LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03either
<drfsupercenter> 03put them on a flash drive or something
*Ascendant sighs
<drfsupercenter> 03what type of video card is it?
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> let me check
<drfsupercenter> 03because at least with my laptop, I can get the drivers straight through nvidia and not the manufacturer
<Ascendant> ATI Radeon HD 7690M (2 GB GDDR5 dedicated)
<drfsupercenter> 03but AMD ones, you tend to need the manu...:/
<drfsupercenter> 03let me look anyway
<Ascendant> that's the graphics card
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Ascendant> thing is I would just be happy with the HP install
<Ascendant> if the computer wasn't being so bitchy
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you don't want HP install
<drfsupercenter> 03:P:
<drfsupercenter> 03*:P
<Ascendant> about letting me partition
<drfsupercenter> 03just trust me on this
<drfsupercenter> 03I have reformatting computers down to a science
<Ascendant> at least linux isn't that fussy
<Ascendant> okay fine
<drfsupercenter> 03make partition, install OS, once you've made your account, disable UAC and reboot
<drfsupercenter> 03then install drivers
<drfsupercenter> 03and yeah
<Ascendant> bleeeh
<Ascendant> I'll use gparted to repartition first
<Ascendant> and then install windows
<drfsupercenter> 03The AMD Mobility Radeon graphics driver supplied by the notebook manufacturer is customized for the built-in display and the features and functions specific to the notebook. It is recommended to use the drivers provided by the notebook manufacturer.
<Ascendant> I need that key by the way
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, that's what I *said*
<drfsupercenter> 03and you have a whole 30 days before you need the key
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'll PM it to you
<drfsupercenter> 03so you can enter it duruing setup
<drfsupercenter> 03*during
<Ascendant> well
*Ascendant reboots the computer
<Ascendant> also gparted hates the touchpad on this thing lol
<Ascendant> so do I but derp
<drfsupercenter> 03I PM'ed you the key
<drfsupercenter> 03it prolly won't activate, but just prod me about that somtime as you have a whole 30 days
<Ascendant> alright
<drfsupercenter> 03what model laptop is it again?
<Ascendant> http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/au/en/ho/WF06b/321957-321957-3329744-64354-64354-5191856-5215563.html?dnr=1
<Ascendant> bleh
<Ascendant> I still need to create a pagefile blah partition
<Ascendant> fml
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows doesn't need that :P
<Ascendant> and then I need to create /home /boot etc. for linux
<drfsupercenter> 03but if you mean for swap space
<drfsupercenter> 03then yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL LINUX
<Ascendant> Well it's linux mint
<Ascendant> which requires deleting everything to upgrade
<drfsupercenter> 03I still think you should just virtualize it
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03that's retarded
<HyperMetalLugia> retarded Linux FT
<HyperMetalLugia> FTL
<Ascendant> well mint is retarded in that
<drfsupercenter> 03I managed to do ubnutu fine
<drfsupercenter> 03*ubuntu
<Ascendant> ubuntu != mint
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<Ascendant> it's some dodgy crap
<drfsupercenter> 03Ubuntu used to be good
<drfsupercenter> 03not anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Ascendant> so I'm going to put /home on a diff partition
<Ascendant> so it doesn't require a lolwipe
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't just point it to an ext3 partition? o.o
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> bleh
<drfsupercenter> 03have you TRIED running Linux in MWare?
<drfsupercenter> 03*VMWare
<drfsupercenter> 03as I swear
<drfsupercenter> 03it should run FINE on that system
<Ascendant> Yes
<Ascendant> It lags
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Ascendant> And for your information
<drfsupercenter> 03did you give it really crappy specs?
<Ascendant> linux is my main operating system
<drfsupercenter> 03give it like 2 gigs of RAM
<Ascendant> not windows
<drfsupercenter> 03I know, hence why I'm whining about you being so stubborn
<Ascendant> I'd rather run windows in a VM on linux
<Ascendant> which I could do
<drfsupercenter> 03that's even more laggy
<Ascendant> so? it's not like I use windows
<HyperMetalLugia> Run win2
<HyperMetalLugia> win2k
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> hah
<HyperMetalLugia> that's fast
<HyperMetalLugia> ;d
<drfsupercenter> 03>not like you use Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03>want to play games
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> drf
<drfsupercenter> 03just accept that you can't live without it
<Ascendant> I didn't boot into windows for at least 3 months
<HyperMetalLugia> We have a contradiction over here?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not trying to turn you into some microsoft fan
<Ascendant> I rarely play games
<drfsupercenter> 03I just hate people going "Pssh, I'm some hardcore haxor, f*** Windows"
<drfsupercenter> 03because seriously
<Ascendant> lol I don't hate windows
<drfsupercenter> 03it's so much more trouble than it's worth to get Linux actually working on hardware
<Ascendant> well once it works it's pretty good
<drfsupercenter> 03and Windows isn't?
<Ascendant> and linux is far better for servers than windows is
<drfsupercenter> 03my laptop basically never crashes
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but
<Ascendant> I didn't say that
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you use your laptop as a server
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't deny that Linux servers are good
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm talking about home use
<drfsupercenter> 03even on a desktop, sure
<drfsupercenter> 03but Linux on laptops - blech
<drfsupercenter> 03*=
<Ascendant> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, don't get me wrong
<Ascendant> ~$ uptime
<Ascendant> 23:48:11 up 248 days, 23:51
<drfsupercenter> 03Ubuntu supported all my hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03but it just sucked
<drfsupercenter> 03like
<Ascendant> that's a linux home server running on a netbook
<Ascendant> 248 days, better than a lot of VPSes
<drfsupercenter> 03even though I had a 2.4GHz CXPU
<HyperMetalLugia> Does it ever move around
<drfsupercenter> 03*CPU
<Ascendant> nope HML
<drfsupercenter> 03It would be running at 800MHz
<drfsupercenter> 03and CPU scaling is one thing
<Ascendant> it's for a server
<drfsupercenter> 03but it would *always* run at 800MHz
<Ascendant> ~$ free -m
<Ascendant> total used free shared buffers cached

<Ascendant> Swap: 1953 146 1807
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd go to boot VMWare, it would take 25 mins to boot WIndows XP and then just crash the stupid computer
<drfsupercenter> 03and it was a Core 2 Duo, not like some proprietary crap...
<Ascendant> model name : Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270 @ 1.60GHz
<drfsupercenter> 03so I just said screw dualbooting
<Ascendant> >VMware
<HyperMetalLugia> OH NO
<Ascendant> lrn2virtualbox
<HyperMetalLugia> Atom
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> I use both
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant that's not my point
<Ascendant> yeah atoms suck
<HyperMetalLugia> U mad?
<drfsupercenter> 03having a VM of XP
<drfsupercenter> 03with 1GB of RAM
<drfsupercenter> 03should NOT take more than 2 mins to boot
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> well
<drfsupercenter> 03this thing took at least 5 before completely freezing my computer
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not even exaggerating -_-
<Ascendant> let me finish making my partition table
<Ascendant> I think I'll allocate 130GB to windows and the rest to linux
<drfsupercenter> 03how big is the drive?
<Ascendant> 640GB
<HyperMetalLugia> Speaking of
<HyperMetalLugia> nice.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> I want 640GB
<drfsupercenter> 03I gave my Linux like 50GB
<Ascendant> 613GB after taking account all the random computer crap
<drfsupercenter> 03and gave the rest to Windows
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not "random computer crap"
<Ascendant> well windows is your main OS
<Ascendant> linux is mine
<drfsupercenter> 03it's called scientific GB vs technical GB

<drfsupercenter> 03I was gonna get a 1TB
<drfsupercenter> 03but I missed the sale
*Ascendant makes a partition
<drfsupercenter> 03and I don't really use my laptop that much
<Ascendant> do I seriously need another partition for swap space? -_-
<drfsupercenter> 03* Ascendant makes a partition <- watch out, we're dealing with a bada** over here
<Ascendant> I really can't be bothered to configure this
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03aloso
<drfsupercenter> 03*also
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Ascendant> daaaaaaaaaaamnit
<Umbreon> you can probably disable swap
<drfsupercenter> 03for Linux you need a swap partition

<Ascendant> linux yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03it has to be the same size as your RAM

<drfsupercenter> 03so in otherwords, 8GB
<HyperMetalLugia> Do want that
<HyperMetalLugia> :c
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<Umbreon> yay HyperMetalLugia wants something
<HyperMetalLugia> My swap wil only be 3GB/4
<drfsupercenter> 03HML
<Ascendant> and obviously there's that random recovery crap
<drfsupercenter> 03that's stupid, that's only 750GB
<drfsupercenter> 03you want a 1TB :P
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<drfsupercenter> 03Newegg
<drfsupercenter> 03had a 1TB laptop drive
<drfsupercenter> 03on sale for $100

<drfsupercenter> 03I was gonna buy one but I missed it
<drfsupercenter> 03wait, what?
<drfsupercenter> 03it shouldn't o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03all you need is the ext3 + swap
<Ascendant> well the default install did
<HyperMetalLugia> but it has 16MB of cache :<
<drfsupercenter> 03or ext4 or whatever you kids use these days
<Ascendant> noooo for windows
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03you only need one NTFS partition
<drfsupercenter> 03OH

<drfsupercenter> 03That's because
<drfsupercenter> 03that recovery crap

<drfsupercenter> 03they're like
<drfsupercenter> 03"we don't want to give you a Windows disc because LOLpiracy so instead we're just going to steal 10% of your hard drive space by putting the contents on there :D"
<Ascendant> I was like "why the f*ck are you eating my hard disk space with your useless crap"

<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 13 time(s).
<drfsupercenter> 03NightSeas
<NightSeas> 12replacing*
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not ScriptBot that does it
<drfsupercenter> 03it's mode +G
<drfsupercenter> 03the server itself does it
<NightSeas> 12then set it
<drfsupercenter> 03and ScriptBot just yells at you if it sees < censored >/
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03the way +G works
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a list of "bad" words
<Lexi> 12I once typed censored in those brackety things and got kicked for it
<Lexi> 12:I
<drfsupercenter> 03it replaces those with < censored> if they're used in the channel
<drfsupercenter> 03so all we do is have ScriptBot yell/kick on that
<drfsupercenter> 03Lexi, read what I just wrote.
<Lexi> 12hmm
<Ascendant> run /stats B
<Ascendant> er sorry
<Ascendant> I mean /stats b

<Ascendant> It is stupid
<NightSeas> 1212yep.
<Ascendant> this is why Sweden <3

<Ascendant> that's retarded

<MysticLugia> 02.....
<MysticLugia> 023 million?
<NightSeas> 1212almost, it was like 18 or 19 songs
<Lakorv> Sweden isn't really all that <3, but I'd better not get involved in discussing politics.

<Ascendant> sorry for spamming
<Xanbreon> Well yeh
<Ascendant> didn't realise it was all newline
<Xanbreon> Anything thats compiled against openssl1
<Lakorv> always newline.
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> that's gonna total around 500 packages
<Ascendant> and I need openssl 0.9.8
<Ascendant> or at least something that's not 1
*Ascendant checks sshpass's syntax
<Lakorv> and how about you install 0.9.8 from source in a different location and then build sshpass to use that?
<Ascendant> Let's see if I can-
<Ascendant> yeah I was thinking about that
<Lakorv> and now I'm off, so have fun with your debian-based distro havoc.
<Ascendant> debian is good though ):
<Lakorv> Arch <3
<Ascendant> debian <3
<Xanbreon> Have you checked is theres a newer version of sshpass
<Ascendant> pretty sure this is the newest
<HyperMetalLugia> Mint <3 </troll>
<Ascendant> $ sshpass -V
<Ascendant> sshpass 1.04 (C) 2006-2008 Lingnu Open Source Consulting Ltd.
<Ascendant> I used Mint 9 for 2 years
<Ascendant> only starting to use Mint 12 now
<Xanbreon> heh
<Ascendant> because upgrading mint sucks
<HyperMetalLugia> Did it get worse?
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> I think I'm going to have to recompile sshpass
<Xanbreon> Good luck and have fun
<HyperMetalLugia> Whyyyyyyy recompiling ;-;
<Ascendant> aaaand it's still extracting
<HyperMetalLugia> I should get a Pentium 1 system
<Ascendant> because HML
<HyperMetalLugia> and recompile everything
<Ascendant> workarounds
<Ascendant> HML
<Ascendant> try get gentoo and do it
<Ascendant> :{D
<Ascendant> >emerge
*Ascendant cringes
<Ascendant> seriously
<HyperMetalLugia> Workarounds for what? :<
<Ascendant> updating gentoo literally takes DAYS
<HyperMetalLugia> oh wow :c
<HyperMetalLugia> Soo
<Ascendant> I'm serious
<HyperMetalLugia> Some programs are compile only?
<Ascendant> huh?
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, source only, nothing is precompiled?
<HyperMetalLugia> blah, brbs
<Ascendant> finally
<Ascendant> $ ./openssl version

<Ascendant> now
<Ascendant> let's get sshpass working
<Xanbreon> =P
<Ascendant> $ sshpass -V
<Ascendant> bash: /usr/bin/sshpass: No such file or directory
<Ascendant> y u so silly
<Ascendant> oh it's /usr/local/in
<Ascendant> wtf
<Ascendant> bin*
<Xanbreon> mhhm
<Ascendant> okay wtf
<Ascendant> why is it STILL not working
<Ascendant> I know it's not an issue with my bash script
<Ascendant> because it has worked in the past
<MysticLugia> 02bash script?
<Ascendant> don't worry
<Ascendant> Xanbreon heeeeeelp
<Xanbreon> Wut
<Xanbreon> What you b0rked?
<Ascendant> idk
<Xanbreon> So, whats the problem?
<Ascendant> sshpass being a PITA
<HyperMetalLugia> Did it wor?
<Ascendant> it's working with sftp
<Ascendant> but not ssh
<Ascendant> seems to be a sshclient issue
<HyperMetalLugia> Somebody should seriously make a USSH (Unsecures shell) :D

<Skylands> 10and last year when I was watching it
<drfsupercenter> 03due to some dispute between Funimation and the other company
<Skylands> 10A few episodes I could only find in dub
<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki> I wonder when Funimation plans to release Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun2> this year sometime proly
<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki> yeah, that's what Wiki says
<drfsupercenter> 03<bluesun2> apparently it's one show Manga tried to campaign to release on BD, but the JP licensor said NO BD 4 U

<drfsupercenter> 03and most of the shorter ones haven't been dubbed x.x
<Lunies> Really good, definitely finish it drf
<Lunies> One of the few that could make me cry
<drfsupercenter> 03well the second boxset wasn't in stock

<HyperMetalLugia> Ignore them, Dubstep is surely the best and only music in the world
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<Lexi> 12I'M CONFUSED NOW
<Skylands> 10Lexi
<Skylands> 10He's mocking us
<Skylands> 10He does this to me all the time
*Light_Latias holds her tongue
<Skylands> 10He thinks that just because there are those who enjoy dubstep, they aren't willing to listen to anything else and think dubstep is the best
<Lexi> 12Why did I click that
<Lexi> 12>.<
<Skylands> 10which clearly isn't the case, as I listen to anything I find interesting
*Skylands kicks HyperMetalLugia.
<Lunies> I'm sure there's people like that but not everyone
<Skylands> 10^
<Lexi> 12When I first heard Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites, I fell in love with it

*Skylands returns it
<LuniesA> Wha?

<LuniesA> You don't like The Hunger Games?
<Lexi> 12I seriously look like someone who's been dragged forwards in time from the 80's XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Did you know that Cool rhymes with fool
<HyperMetalLugia> :.
<LuniesA> Or Warriors?
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<Skylands> 10He doesn't
*Lexi 12throws Sega controller at HML
<HyperMetalLugia> Thank you, I needed a spare controlled
<Lunies> I really liked the first two series for Warriors, then it got old
<Lexi> 12I can't type today
<HyperMetalLugia> *controller
<Lexi> 12D:<
<Lunies> But The Hunger Games is supposed to be great, I haven't read it yet though
<HyperMetalLugia> Hurr, boring books
<HyperMetalLugia> Not a surprise
<Lexi> 12I've seen the movie
<Lexi> 12now I need to get the books
<HyperMetalLugia> Lunies will love it because everybody else does
<Lunies> My mom did the same thing!
<HyperMetalLugia> So that's not an issue
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<Lexi> 12SHEEP
<Lunies> Just because you like something popular, doesn't mean you're a sheep
<HyperMetalLugia> Dubsheep, TwiSheep, GameSheep, iSheep, you name it, I'm listening to them riight now
<Skylands> 10[19:26] <HyperMetalLugia> Hurr, boring books
<Skylands> 10Can't say that if you have never read them
<HyperMetalLugia> I have a book on Google
<Skylands> 10You can say you dislike the concept of the story, but not the actual books themselves
<HyperMetalLugia> It is NOT informational
<HyperMetalLugia> Can you correct me on that?
<Skylands> 10Good books don't have to be informational.
<Skylands> 10Good books are for entertainment purposes too
<HyperMetalLugia> You missed the point
<Skylands> 10I doubt you even know what entertainment is
<HyperMetalLugia> I meant that as a question
<Skylands> 10Mr. play mindless video games all day
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<Skylands> 10I corrected you
<HyperMetalLugia> Not anymore, nothing is really entertainment with all the trash flowing around
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<Lunies> What's not trash?
<HyperMetalLugia> You corrected the wrong thing
<Lunies> If you mind me asking
<HyperMetalLugia> Anything that is good and deserves to be good? I don't see many people hating Shakespeare these days
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<Skylands> 10>yet you bash hipsters
<Skylands> 10You seem to be one, only liking things until they become 'overrated' or 'mainstream'
<HyperMetalLugia> Uh
<HyperMetalLugia> Not exactly true
<HyperMetalLugia> As only I only would have known or cared about them after they were mass popularised
<Light_Latias> 12Sky
<Light_Latias> 12Danny is the same
<Skylands> 10Light, I know
<Skylands> 10They do not differ from each other by much
<SilverSonic> hey LL: you talked about how theres 2 different versions of Forest Temple

<Aurora> 6turns out it was a couple tubes that had holes in them
<drf-Droid> it might just die LOL

<Xanbreon> Matching sticks is always better
<Kyu> 07are they dual channel
<nickstr> RAM memory is SMD/SMT
<nickstr> plus ultra sensitive to static electricity
<drf-Droid> um
<drf-Droid> aren't all DDR2 dual channel?
<HyperMetalLugia> uh well
<Kyu> 07not if you don't buy them as pairs
<drf-Droid> well duh
<Xanbreon> ..
<drf-Droid> but I'm buying 2
<HyperMetalLugia> Only really if you match the sticks up :s
<Xanbreon> As long as you have sets it works
<Xanbreon> Matching is always better
<Xanbreon> But non matched sticks work fine
<HyperMetalLugia> tell that to my laptop
<drf-Droid> well
<Xanbreon> But they will always default to the specs of the lowest stick
<drf-Droid> this has CAS latency 5
<drf-Droid> I just looked it up
<drf-Droid> that's fine, right?
<drf-Droid> DDR2 800
<HyperMetalLugia> > Accidentally brought a 1333 mhz DDR3 chip, laptop only supports a max of 1066
<drf-Droid> heck, I should get 4
<drf-Droid> since
<drf-Droid> the 2x2GB I have
<drf-Droid> are diff brands
<drf-Droid> >_>
<Light_Latias> 12brb
<drf-Droid> so if all 4 are the same, it'll work better?
<HyperMetalLugia> How did you do that?
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<drf-Droid> 8GB max, I wanna max it out
<drf-Droid> HML
<HyperMetalLugia> make sure the timings are the same
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<Kyu> 07just pairs of two
<drf-Droid> I pulled them from a PRE BUILT COMPUTER
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL WOW
<drf-Droid> and it had 2 different brands
<drf-Droid> odd, right?
<drf-Droid> yep
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<drf-Droid> may
<drf-Droid> ...
<drf-Droid> oh
<drf-Droid> I know what happened
<drf-Droid> one of them broke
<Kyu> 07but all 4 speeds should be the same
<drf-Droid> and my dad replaced it
<Xanbreon> You should match timings and latency etc, voltages etc
<drf-Droid> yeah
<drf-Droid> ill just buy 4 identical sticks
<drf-Droid> that'll work for sure :P
<Kyu> 07why are you building something outdated in the first place lol
<drf-Droid> I'm upgrading it, rather
<drf-Droid> and because I can
<drf-Droid> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL wow
<HyperMetalLugia> so the stick I brought from the store, the 1333mhz one
<drf-Droid> it's a pretty legit HTPC case
<drf-Droid> I like it :P
<HyperMetalLugia> All the timings are 1 higher than the internal chip
<HyperMetalLugia> I suck
<drf-Droid> also micro center is stupid sometimes
<drf-Droid> "patriot desktop memory"
<HyperMetalLugia> Though, I haven't seen any problems yet
<drf-Droid> >picture is laptop memory
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<drf-Droid> >actual item is laptop memory
<drf-Droid> -_
<drf-Droid> -
<HyperMetalLugia> ...fail
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drf-Droid> ...yep trololol
<drf-Droid> 2 2GB sticks is $60
<HyperMetalLugia> Your Truck won't start?
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<drf-Droid> AND that's CL6, the singles are 5
<drf-Droid> that's stupid
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF
<HyperMetalLugia> Opposite here
<drf-Droid> buying 4 singles :P
<Kyu> 07link?
<HyperMetalLugia> The singles are more expensive
<HyperMetalLugia> than the kit
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<Lexi> 12O.o
<drf-Droid> that's how it's supposed to be
<drf-Droid> hence why they even sell kits
<drf-Droid> :P
<drf-Droid> anyway bbl, gotta shop around some more
<drf-Droid> and hope I don't die in a giant explosion due to an engine failure :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Be
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey LL
<HyperMetalLugia> Can I have his computers
<HyperMetalLugia> If he does die

<Drake> 04Agreed.
<Drake> 04We should set Angel on fire and use HER for warmth

*Angel_Umbreon runs
<Ascendant> We're still kilometres apart and I'm not feeling up to the challenge of travelling to visit him

<Umbreon> gnome i might have
<Ascendant> how the HELL do you get the taskbar stuff blinking?
<Ascendant> xchat isn't flashing when I get highlighted etc.
<Ascendant> on gnome 2 it worked fine
<Ascendant> but on linux mint 12 running MGSE/gnome 3 it's not
<Umbreon> is it disabled in the settings?
<Ascendant> I can't find it anywhere
<Ascendant> xchat's settings are fine
<Umbreon> i'm trying to think
<Umbreon> since i don't rely on the taskbar in linux mint 12
<Umbreon> i just downloaded an application called docky
<Umbreon> XD
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> I use Avira or whatever it was called, forgot the name
<Umbreon> and i pin all my most used programs to it
<Ascendant> to dock applications
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> Well I kinda rely on the taskbar
<Ascendant> system tray is blinking fine
<Umbreon> :/
<Ascendant> and I kinda dislike MGSE
<Ascendant> I don't like gnome 3
<Ascendant> gnome 2 is <3
<Ascendant> gnome 3...bleh
<Umbreon> i saw gnome 4.3
<Ascendant> hm
<Skylands> 10hm
<Drake> 04I still can't believe I beat the E4
<Skylands> 10I thought Emerald E4 wasn't too challenging
<Sakuya> lol that's what I told drake
<Drake> 04It kind of is when your strongest Pokemon is level 52 :'D
<Skylands> 10More RBY and FRLG for me

<Sakuya> eh?
<Drake> 04lol
<Sakuya> gsc had one?
<Skylands> 10Yes
<Drake> 04clone Pokemon while holding rare candy, amirite?
<Sakuya> or are we talking about rby now
<Skylands> 10Had to do with giving your Pokémon a held item and inserting it into the PC boxes
<Skylands> 10GSC
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04that's the clone Pokemon trick
<Drake> 04I remember that
<Drake> 04Having 3 Mewtwo's was awesome
<Skylands> 10Mewtwo... in GSC?
<Sakuya> oh that one

<drfsupercenter> 03don't ask me then
<Skylands> 10What year was it, Rhaiyne?
<Ascendant> yeah but
<drfsupercenter> 03but it could be graphics drivers
<Ascendant> have you used gnome 3?
<RhaiyneDay> 6a what?
<drfsupercenter> 03AMD + Linux = no
<Ascendant> I dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<RhaiyneDay> 6What year?
<drfsupercenter> 03I've used whatever Ubuntu 9.04 uses
<Skylands> 10You came here
<Ascendant> I have a feeling it's MGSE/gnome 3 doing it
<Ascendant> but I can't be sure
<Ascendant> and yeah linux hates AMDs
<RhaiyneDay> 6 3 and 3/4 years ago..
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly, what do you even do on Linux that you can't do on Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03for servers I can understand but eh
<RhaiyneDay> 6well...thats how long it has been since i havent been on...
<Skylands> 10well, I've been here nearly 4 years
<RhaiyneDay> 6oh ok
<Skylands> 10Maybe you left right around the time I arrived
<RhaiyneDay> 6i probably have
<Ascendant> drf I just like it more :x
<RhaiyneDay> 6I had another friend from alaska who showed me this site...
<Ascendant> but really
<Skylands> 10Welcome back, nonetheless.
<drfsupercenter> 03well you might be forced to switch :P
<Ascendant> thank you so much for helping me to set up windows
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried the whole Linux thing
<Ascendant> how so?
<drfsupercenter> 03and was like
<drfsupercenter> 03screw it
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean if your Linux drivers won't work with the hardware
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you can deal with it just not workiung fully
<drfsupercenter> 03-u
<Ascendant> yeah true
<Ascendant> but tbh
<Ascendant> I was really lucky
<Ascendant> because everything so far has worked
<Ascendant> without me needing to modify anything
<drfsupercenter> 03it worked on my laptop too, but I specifically got parts that would work on both OSes
<RhaiyneDay> 6Well thank you :) I'm writing a story. it's about a girl whose life has been saved by a song...lol
<drfsupercenter> 03but that stupid CPU scaling thing
<drfsupercenter> 03just pissed me off

<drfsupercenter> 03he sends it in for warranty fixing
<drfsupercenter> 03and they tell him it was void for neglect
<drfsupercenter> 03because it had "too much dust" in it
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03That's one of several Sony facepalms LOL
<RhaiyneDay> 6i miss gaming devices
<Skylands> 10Odd Sony
<RhaiyneDay> 6*haha*
<RhaiyneDay> 6Sony...
<drfsupercenter> 03he's like "let me get this straight, it's neglecting the console by leaving it in my media center like you indended, and because taking it apart voids the warranty, you expect me to clean the dust out HOW?"
<drfsupercenter> 03they were like "Um" and just hung up on him
<drfsupercenter> 03the dude even recorded the calls
<Skylands> 10This invisalign bugs me
<RhaiyneDay> 6LMFAO
<drfsupercenter> 03it was only after he posted it all over the Internet
<RhaiyneDay> 6that is so stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03and Sony saw it
<Skylands> 10They gave it to me for my bottom row teeth
<drfsupercenter> 03that they were like "OK fine" and replaced it
<RhaiyneDay> 6HOW are you suposed to clean it then?
<drfsupercenter> 03but it made them look stupid, which is like :P
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the point
<drfsupercenter> 03My PS3 still works, but I hardly use it anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03and only for movies
<drfsupercenter> 03that, and my house isn't very dusty since we actually clean it
<RhaiyneDay> 6the only gaming device i have lext is an xbox...
<drfsupercenter> 03Awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03Xbox 360 is by far my favorite

<drfsupercenter> 03because they they don't make any money off me

<Rhiannyn> 6WTF?
<Umbreon> HyperMetalLugia
<Umbreon> is perl an okay programming language?
<Umbreon> or is c better?
<Umbreon> or c+
<HyperMetalLugia> ewww
<HyperMetalLugia> perl is for scripting babien00bs
<Rhiannyn> 6My teacher in woods, was like, don't get any of the finish or thinner on your skin, it will go through you blood stream and mess up your kidneys
<HyperMetalLugia> C plz
<HyperMetalLugia> :DF
<Rhiannyn> 6boobs?
<Umbreon> noobs
<HyperMetalLugia> c or C# is okay
<Rhiannyn> 6C flat
<Rhiannyn> 6kidding...
<Rhiannyn> 6i read that thing wrong...
<Ascendant> oh god C
<Ascendant> at least not C++
<Ascendant> Umbreon
<HyperMetalLugia> C++ is evil
<Ascendant> do NOT do C++
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<Ascendant> it will rot your brains
<Rhiannyn> 6the babien00bs
<Ascendant> try python or C
<Ascendant> C# is apparently a better version of java
<Rhiannyn> 6hat is C plus plus?
<Ascendant> You can also try Lua or Ruby on Rails
<Rhiannyn> 6ur bak!
<Umbreon> for a second i thought Ascendant said luna
<Umbreon> XD
<Rhiannyn> 6lol
<Rhiannyn> 6and i am still *clueless* even though i have never watched that movie...
<Rhiannyn> 6she soundsl ike that one girl who voiced the cartoon of Sabrina the Teenage witch when iwas like 7
<Rhiannyn> 6actually i was bannd from watching it when i was 4 , soo....
<Rhiannyn> 6*so many idlers*
<Ascendant> heh Umbreon
<Ascendant> Lua's apparently nice
<Ascendant> you can also do PHP
<Umbreon> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Ascendant> perl is pretty powerful, though never really tried it
<Ascendant> python and C are both pretty good
<Ascendant> C has some horrible syntax but it's not as bad as C++

<drfsupercenter> 03why would it have Vista if it's new
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Lighty> 06like half a year old now
<Lighty> 06it cant do much
<Lighty> 06so im getting him to downgrade it to XP SP3
<Lexi> 12...But after spilling that juice on it, half the keyboard and one speaker are ruined.
<drfsupercenter> 03or get Windows 7?
<Lighty> 06wont hold it
<Lexi> 12I like XP.
<HyperMetalLugia> Upgrade it to Windows 7? :c
<Lighty> 06XP was awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> XP sucks now
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03if it can run Vista, it can run 7
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<Lighty> 06nah
<Lighty> 06not gonna try
<NightSeas|Laptop> XP was awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> *was*
<NightSeas|Laptop> now it's not :D
<Lexi> 12Windows 8's pre-beta is apparently available for download now
<Lighty> 06it has *TROUBLE* running vista, so its gonna be XP
<Lexi> 12XP FTW.
<Lighty> 06i still like it
<NightSeas|Laptop> Vista is harder to run then 7
<drfsupercenter> 03XP is fine but if it's a "new" laptop...
<HyperMetalLugia> You should be running 7 anyway, pointless to install XP :|
<HyperMetalLugia> And if it is a half decent laptop, XP might run worse
<Lighty> 06hm
<Lighty> 062.5GB RAM
<HyperMetalLugia> that's more than enough
<HyperMetalLugia> My laptop ran 7 fine with only 2GB

<HyperMetalLugia> I don't want to have a 64bit OS

<Drake> 04Yeah, I know that Theguesst
<Theguesst> k
<Drake> 04But I wanted to know if they would do it an unlimited amount of times
<Theguesst> probably...
<Drake> 04Bulbapedia only shows 4 times, but it doesn't say "Stop challenging you"
<NightSeas> 12See, I've never tried to do that XD
<Drake> 04Just shows their team changes
<HyperMetalLugia> > Customised
<HyperMetalLugia> > Effort
<HyperMetalLugia> I want to run it without dealing with different layers of emulation
<HyperMetalLugia> Not to mention it's pointless for me on here as this thing doesn't have more than 4GB currently
<Lighty> 06Hyper
<Lighty> 06if you're LAZY, you wont get better games
<HyperMetalLugia> What.
<HyperMetalLugia> "better games"
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't play new/'better' games
<HyperMetalLugia> I rarely game on here anyway
<HyperMetalLugia> if so, it's emulated SNES/N64 games
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't need to customise Windows 7 just to do that

<Drake> 04we understand
<Drake> 04we don't need you reinstating your opinion every 5 seconds
<Lexi> 12I saw a foil Zekrom card yesyerday but I couldn't get it >.<
<Drake> 04XD
<drfsupercenter> 03Drake it's not every 5 seconds
<Lexi> 12I want it sooooo badly
<Drake> 04Sure as hell feels like it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I haven't bashed 5th gen in at least a week :<
<drfsupercenter> 03so it was due
<Drake> 04Anyway
<Drake> 04Been replaying Emerald, but jesus christ there are no good places to train after the E4
<Lexi> 12That's often the case
<Lexi> 12sadly
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04And my team isn't strong enough to reliably beat the E4 for training
<Drake> 04highest level is 52
<Lexi> 12I still use my GBC. ^^

<junh1024-XD> ':d
<drfsupercenter> 03:c @ what?
<Lexi> 12Drake's predicament
<Ascendant> FFFFFFS
<Ascendant> Assassin's Creed
<Ascendant> Keeps crashing
<Ascendant> it freezes and crashes on the second tutorial part
<Ascendant> ffff
<Ascendant> drfffffffffffffff
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<Ascendant> ;____;
<Lexi> 12hi
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03did you pirate it? LOL
<Ascendant> yeah :x
<drfsupercenter> 03that's probably why
<drfsupercenter> 03it's probably some error with the crack or something
<Ascendant> I actually didn't even install it properly because the stupid thing wouldn't install
<Ascendant> eeeeeeeeeeeeh
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that's probably why
<Ascendant> Well
<Ascendant> It should work
<drfsupercenter> 03if you want to turn your laptop into a space heater with Crysis
<Ascendant> Even though I haven't installed it fully
<drfsupercenter> 03I can help
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03OK seriously
<Ascendant> That would be nice
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows does not work like Linux
<Ascendant> I'm freezing my ass off
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't just "partially install" stuff
<Ascendant> ):
<drfsupercenter> 03if it has an installer, use it
<Ascendant> linux doesn't like partially installed stuff either
<Ascendant> it has an installer
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ascendant> I tried usingit
<drfsupercenter> 03aren't a lot of linux programs just executanbles?
<Ascendant> it got stuck on some random .forge file
<drfsupercenter> 03that you ./ ?
<Ascendant> .bin files?
<Ascendant> they still require the dependencies to be met
<Ascendant> thus why I sometimes get into dependency hell
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL DEPENDENCIES
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03at least with Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03MOST of the time
<drfsupercenter> 03sensible programs will bundle the prereqs
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03(which are basically dependencies)
<Ascendant> same with linux
<drfsupercenter> 03Linux is like "LOL GO DO IT YOURSELF"
<Xanbreon> So you get tons and tons of repeated libs
<drfsupercenter> 03eh, I've had a lot of problems
<Ascendant> well linux's package manager
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I said SENSIBLE, Xanbreon
<drfsupercenter> 03the ons I've seen
<drfsupercenter> 03will go "Oh, you already have .NET framework, OK then"
<drfsupercenter> 03not like "let's just install another copy"
<drfsupercenter> 03but if you don't have it, it'll install it
<Ascendant> The only case where you DO get a lot of dependency hell
<Ascendant> is on ubuntu/debian/mint
<drfsupercenter> 03VMWare Tools
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03that too
<Xanbreon> .net framework is diff
<Ascendant> when the bloody repos are crap
<drfsupercenter> 03actually VMWare Tools for Linux is quite good
<Ascendant> and have old versions of stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03it just magically works
<drfsupercenter> 03xD
<Ascendant> and you need the newer one
<drfsupercenter> 03but you have to chmod +x and ./ it
<Ascendant> and then you need to install about 100 different .deb files from the damn debian site
<Lexi> 12This is depressing http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/21/2d9a1daf-f1f6-4703-ab80-7c0c18e54e79.jpg
<Ascendant> because the stupid god damn things don't do it for you
<Lexi> 12whoa.
<Ascendant> I had to do that once
<Ascendant> it sucked
<Ascendant> and in the end it didn't even work
<Ascendant> so bawwwwww
<Lexi> 12Looks like I just caught up after a crapload of lag O.o
<Ascendant> so like
<Ascendant> someone give me a good mmo or game in general to play
<drfsupercenter> 03Good MMO is like
<drfsupercenter> 03an oxymoron
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<drfsupercenter> 03but uh, I have like
<drfsupercenter> 03every Star Wars game onS team
<drfsupercenter> 03never played any
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd give them all to you if I could
<drfsupercenter> 03there was some sale where you could get like every SW game ever for $50
<drfsupercenter> 03(well, up to when the sale was, I believe a year ago)
<Lexi> 12:T
<Ascendant> wait what?
<Ascendant> <%drfsupercenter> 03every Star Wars game onS team
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> even the ROTS game?
<Ascendant> and Drake wants me to get TF2
<Ascendant> I'm very iffy about it
<Xanbreon> tf2 fffkkkerr
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<drfsupercenter> 03don't get TF2
<drfsupercenter> 03ever
<drfsupercenter> 03unloess you literally want to be spending every waking moment playing it
<drfsupercenter> 03and uh
<Xanbreon> TF2 is great
<drfsupercenter> 03let me check Ascendant
<Xanbreon> Shoo
<Ascendant> like Feather
<drfsupercenter> 03<Xanbreon> Shoo
<drfsupercenter> 03<Ascendant> like Feather
<Xanbreon> You can play TF2 in moderation
<drfsupercenter> 03that actually works.
<Xanbreon> Its just fun
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> I like games like KH and SW: ROTS
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/o3uzW.png
<Ascendant> and podracer/racer revenge
<drfsupercenter> 03I got all of those for $50 total
<Xanbreon> KH = kingdom hearts?
<drfsupercenter> 03so it might not be every one ever but it's a lot
<Light_Latias> 12~
<Ascendant> yeah
<Xanbreon> O-o
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> knights of the old republic
<Ascendant> I want SW:TOR
<Ascendant> care to get that for me?
*Ascendant runs
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03didn't you ask before
<drfsupercenter> 03how much does it cost
<Xanbreon> l2torrent
<drfsupercenter> 03I can also get you a SW TORrent
*drfsupercenter runs
<drfsupercenter> 03or optionally TOR browser?
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> I have no idea
<Xanbreon> bad puns
<Xanbreon> gtfo drf
<Ascendant> http://www.swtor.com/
<Ascendant> it's pretty expensive and it's a monthly thing or whatnot
<Xanbreon> Oh you mean the MMO
<Ascendant> I was only kidding anyway lol
<Ascendant> yeah
<Xanbreon> you are a derp
<Ascendant> of course I mean the MMO ):
*Xanbreon slaps Ascendant with a cannon
*junh1024-XD f2k New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Derrick Inouye - Canon & Gigue (Pachebel) performed by String Quartet (2chFLAC@783kbps, 22.76mb/4:03)

<Xanbreon> You are losing your street cred NS
<Xanbreon> Tish tish
<junh1024-XD> inb4 Kanon D Dur
<Ascendant> hah!
<junh1024-XD> inb4 tsk tsk
<Lexi> 12O.o
*Ascendant still wants SW:TOR
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd give it to you if I could :(
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought you meant Knights of TOR
<drfsupercenter> 03well um
<drfsupercenter> 03I could buy you the game + the 60 days, like they show on their site but I am not paying per month LOL
<Drake> 04who
<Drake> 04nickalerted
<drfsupercenter> 03though EW ORIGIN
<drfsupercenter> 03:|
<Ascendant> Seriously, drf>
<Ascendant> Seriously, drf?*
<drfsupercenter> 03it's $30
<drfsupercenter> 03i"m not buying the deluxe one
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but I've bought games for people before
<Ascendant> isn't it $80 still?
<drfsupercenter> 03so why not
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03$30
<drfsupercenter> 03for the regular one
*Ascendant checks
<Ascendant> standard says $80
<Ascendant> but that might be the game
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03it's $40
<drfsupercenter> 03http://buy.swtor.com/us/
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe it's because you're not in the US?
<Ascendant> uh
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
*Ascendant checks again
<drfsupercenter> 03hm,
<drfsupercenter> 03the game itself is $40
<drfsupercenter> 03the 60 day thing is separate
<Ascendant> Ah yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I could get you the game
<Ascendant> I'm not in the US
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but you'd have to get the service
<drfsupercenter> 03as the US one prolly wouldn't work anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm sure the game wold
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> Yeah probs
<drfsupercenter> 03I do that all the time with STeam
<drfsupercenter> 03my European friends will buy games through me
<Ascendant> Doesn't matter, I was kinda joking anyway XD
<drfsupercenter> 03since it's usually the same price in $ as 
<drfsupercenter> 03so $20 is less than 20 etc
<drfsupercenter> 03so they'll just paypal me $20 to get the game xD

<Ascendant> heh
<drfsupercenter> 03http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/epic-win-photos-pillow-design-win.jpg
<Drake> 04http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/3746757_460s.jpg
<Ascendant> so what's that about the other steam games?
<Ascendant> I barely even know how steam functions anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/epic-win-photos-warning-win.png
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04Steam is just a program that tracks your games
<Drake> 04and lets you browse for others that it can track and manage
<drfsupercenter> 03Steam is basically a form of DRM :(
<drfsupercenter> 03and the servers die all the f'ing time
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's a pain in the a**
<drfsupercenter> 03but you need it for some stuff
<Ascendant> hurp
<drfsupercenter> 03http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/epic-win-photos-wrong-way-win.jpg
<Ascendant> I dunno
<Ascendant> I'm not a very big gamer
<Ascendant> I prefer things like KH and SW:ROTS
<Ascendant> and podracer
<Ascendant> things I can actually play without failing at
<Ascendant> unlike oblivion
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> any game suggestions?
<Ascendant> BESIDES TF2
<Drake> 04on Steam?
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> or anything really
<Drake> 04Spiral Knights is fun for the first few days
<Drake> 04Star Wars Battlefront 2 on Steam as well
<Ascendant> oh god battlefront
<drfsupercenter> 03well Ascendant I could probably gift you a game or two on Steam
<Ascendant> I STILL can't play that
<drfsupercenter> 03because that requires you to be running Windows *trollface*
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> ):
<Ascendant> you can run steam via wine
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> quite well
<drfsupercenter> 03I seriously don't see why you insist on Linux so much LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03I get that you use it on your other computers
<Ascendant> I'm on windows atm lol
<drfsupercenter> 03but why not just keep one with Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah but the whole dualboot thing
<Ascendant> it HAS windows
<drfsupercenter> 03doesn't mean you'll use it :P
<junh1024-XD> Drake the photoshop one was so lol
<junh1024-XD> (lold irl)
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> OH COOL ASSASSIN'S CREED EXISTS
<Xanbreon> Steam runs quite well under wine
<Ascendant> I might actually grab my oblivion disk and install it on it
<Ascendant> even though I SUCKED at said game
<Xanbreon> You just generally suck >;3
<Ascendant> ):
<Ascendant> okay coooooooome on I want to game for a bit at least
<Ascendant> and then move tintower to its new serv
<drfsupercenter> 03so do you want a game or not XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I can gift yous omething
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 you ask for the most obnoxiously expensive thing on Steam'
<Xanbreon> TF2 you derp
<Xanbreon> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03that's free
<drfsupercenter> 03but EW HIGHLY ADDICTIVE GAMES
<Xanbreon> Its fun
<drfsupercenter> 03>Highly addictive
<Xanbreon> Pfft
<Ascendant> I dunno drf
<Xanbreon> Everything can be addictive
<Ascendant> any suggestions?
<Drake> 04I will keep repeating TF2, but other than that I don't know much.
<junh1024-XD> 11<3+godzilla11> 13374619: Today, after weeks of thinking and playing every outcome possible in my head, I told my parents I'm gay. My dad nodded and didn't even look up from his book; my mom told me to go to the doctor if it starts to itch. FML
<drfsupercenter> 03well, L4D2 and such
<Xanbreon> > EW ADDICTIVE GAMES
<drfsupercenter> 03that's probably the only game I really use Steam for
<Ascendant> what IS L4D2 about anyway?
<Xanbreon> etcetc
<drfsupercenter> 03L4D2 isn't really addictive
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a zombie shooter
<drfsupercenter> 03but team-bsaed
<drfsupercenter> 03*based
<Ascendant> shooters
<Ascendant> nope.avi
<drfsupercenter> 034-player humans fighting zombies
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Xanbreon> pfft
<drfsupercenter> 03I can get you one of the SW games via Steam if you want LOL
*Ascendant ponders
<Xanbreon> Matter of opinion~
<drfsupercenter> 03tbh
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate shooters too
<drfsupercenter> 03but L4D is an exception
<drfsupercenter> 03dunno why, it's just fun
<Xanbreon> >__>
<drfsupercenter> 03but stuff like COD can die in a fire
<Ascendant> empire at war looks interesting
<Ascendant> and I remember the ultimate sith edition of TFU
<Ascendant> the ending was interesting
<drfsupercenter> 03hm Xanbreon, ever used Symantec/Norton Ghost?
<Ascendant> but I didn't like killing darth vader
<Ascendant> EW NORTON
<drfsupercenter> 03I agree
<drfsupercenter> 03but Ghost is useful
<Xanbreon> Blerg Norton
<drfsupercenter> 03mine is Symantec
<drfsupercenter> 03I stole it from work
<Xanbreon> I wouldnt touch anything made by them
<drfsupercenter> 03before they required regkeys
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a bootable image
<Xanbreon> I know what it is
<drfsupercenter> 03that you run and it can create images of HDDs
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the newer ones also install
<drfsupercenter> 03on Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03which I don't get the point oif
<drfsupercenter> 03*of
<drfsupercenter> 03well I ask because
<Ascendant> any good space flight simulators?
<Xanbreon> mhm?
<drfsupercenter> 03for some reason, the one I have doesn't seem to recognize my hard drive if I have AHCI enabled
<drfsupercenter> 03I have to IDE emulate it
<drfsupercenter> 03and I dunno why
<drfsupercenter> 03works on other PCs
<Xanbreon> probs a AHCI bug
<drfsupercenter> 03I got XP to work with it
<drfsupercenter> 03I just got AMD's achix86 drivers and slipstreamed it
<Xanbreon> Mhhm
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why XP doesn't like USB floppy drives
<drfsupercenter> 03or I'd just do the F6 thing
<Ascendant> hey drffffffffffffff
<Ascendant> can I have Starpoint Gemini?
<drfsupercenter> 03sec
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03sure I guess
<Ascendant> ofu
<drfsupercenter> 03did you already register for Steam?
<Ascendant> sec this laptop is almost out of battery
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> no
<Ascendant> I will do that
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I can send it via email
<drfsupercenter> 03but direct is easier
<Ascendant> alright
<Ascendant> what do I need to run steam games?
<Ascendant> besides a computer
<drfsupercenter> 03that's it really
<drfsupercenter> 03it varies from game to game
<drfsupercenter> 03newer games need more processing power etc
<Ascendant> well this one I should be able to run
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03you should be able to run most things, it seems like a pretty decent laptop :P
<Xanbreon> What laptop is that?
<Ascendant> HP Pavilion Dv6 6c20TX
<Xanbreon> Ahh, nice
<Ascendant> so uh drf
<Ascendant> I don't need to download some steam client or whatnot?
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03steampowered.com or whatever
<Ascendant> ):
<Ascendant> I'm registering
<drfsupercenter> 03once you do
<drfsupercenter> 03add me as a friend
<drfsupercenter> 03and I can gift that game
<Ascendant> meh all my usual usernames are taken but I expected that
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> what should I use
<Ascendant> Rathicus or Dragoran?
<drfsupercenter> 03nightshadow is taken?
<Drake> 04...for?
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<Drake> 04Dragoran
<drfsupercenter> 03once you sign up, you can change the display name
<Ascendant> actually Dragoran is taken
<drfsupercenter> 03Feather changes hers all the fricking time LOL
<Drake> 04oh Steam
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04NS it doesn't matter
<Ascendant> ):
<drfsupercenter> 03well it only matters for logging in
<Drake> 04chose an obscure username, and change your display name later
<drfsupercenter> 03and what you tell people :P
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<drfsupercenter> 03because then if someone wants to find you
<drfsupercenter> 03to add you
<drfsupercenter> 03they have to find that
<drfsupercenter> 03I think
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04I think so
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Drake> 04Which is why no one can find my account :<
<Drake> 04I keep telling them to search "Harbinger" instead of "uraaloser"
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 that was on purpose
<Ascendant> secret questions are retarded
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I disabled all the security crap on mine
<drfsupercenter> 03SteamGard pisses me off
<drfsupercenter> 03*Guard
<Ascendant> secret questions
<Ascendant> only open up more security holes tbh
<Drake> 04also uraaloser is an obscure Monster Hunter joke so if you think I am being unoriginal you are dumb
<Ascendant> it's easier to crack a security question
<drfsupercenter> 03>social engineering
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<Ascendant> than it is to crack a password
<Ascendant> half the time the security question is the idiot's IRL name or username
<Xanbreon> You cant code around idiots
<Xanbreon> Steam guard is great though
<drfsupercenter> 03EW STEAM GUARD
<drfsupercenter> 03it pisses me off since I actually let people borrow my account
<drfsupercenter> 03to try games
<drfsupercenter> 03and achievement farm for me *cough*
<Xanbreon> I personally have quite a lot of cash invested in my account, and 2 factor authentication is great
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a ton too but it's not like people are going to try to hack mine or something
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I don't trust you, but most other people :P
<Xanbreon> ;)
<Xanbreon> Steam accounts are big targets, so meh
<drfsupercenter> 03my Xbox Live was hacked, Steam hasn't been
<drfsupercenter> 03so make of that what you will
<Ascendant> wooooooooooooah how the hell does it know I'm Nightshadow?
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's special
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno
<drfsupercenter> 03er wait
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<Ascendant> maybe cus' I used my site email which is nightshadow@
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Xanbreon> Oh yeh XBL is another big target
<drfsupercenter> 03I think I got botnetted for that one :/
<drfsupercenter> 03but MS was good about refunding me
<drfsupercenter> 03for what the idiots spent
<drfsupercenter> 03AND I got to keep the games they bought
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> drf
<Ascendant> username is drfsupercenter?
<drfsupercenter> 03no duh
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> how do I add you

After about 5 minutes i asked the teacher what we were going to do. He replied just take a nap. The paper is just to make it look like were doing something useful. Best teacher ever. MLIA
<Xanbreon> It cant find you
<Xanbreon> O-o
<Ascendant> o_O
<Xanbreon> have you verified your email etc?
<Ascendant> I just did
<Ascendant> try again
<Xanbreon> Found you
<Ascendant> it says "some features only become available once you have a game in your account"
<Ascendant> deeeerp
<Xanbreon> Just add TF2
<Xanbreon> Its free
<Ascendant> o_o
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03it happened with Feather too
<drfsupercenter> 03before I gifted her a game
<drfsupercenter> 03after you redeem it you should be fine
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> you can add me drf
<Ascendant> Xanbreon added me
<drfsupercenter> 03just did
<drfsupercenter> 03fricking accept it already
*drfsupercenter hides
<Ascendant> okay done
<Ascendant> wtf
<Ascendant> why is tf2 10GB
<Ascendant> that's like
<Ascendant> a bloody 6th of my monthly bandwidth
<Xanbreon> 10gig is pretty small for a game these days
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant
<drfsupercenter> 03resist the urge to play that crap
<drfsupercenter> 03:(
<Xanbreon> Frack off drf, you play music games, you cant talk :P
<drfsupercenter> 03those at least end at some point
<drfsupercenter> 03once I've played all the good songs
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Xanbreon> Self defined point
<Xanbreon> "good"
<Xanbreon> etc
<Xanbreon> Same diff
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> I don't really mind
<Ascendant> I'm not going to download it
<drfsupercenter> 03alright you should be set
<drfsupercenter> 03redeem it and it'll let you do whatever :P
<Ascendant> thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks
*Ascendant hugs drf
<drfsupercenter> 03np
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno why Steam does that
<Xanbreon> Few more games and you might get boobs ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03"you have to actually have a game before you can add friends"
<drfsupercenter> 03From what I've heard though, TF2 DOESN'T count
<drfsupercenter> 03because it has to be a PAID game
<Xanbreon> Aahh
<drfsupercenter> 03Feather only played TF2 and wasn't able to add friends
<Xanbreon> Anti spam
<drfsupercenter> 03until I gifted her something
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but what pisses me off
<drfsupercenter> 03I gifted her L4D2
<drfsupercenter> 03and her stupid laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03can't handle it
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>|
<drfsupercenter> 03granted it was only $5 but LOL
<Xanbreon> Should have checked the requirements
<Ascendant> SEE Xanbreon
<Ascendant> Starpoint Gemini is only 2GB
<Xanbreon> Thats old
<Ascendant> not as bad as 10GB
<Ascendant> I'm downloading at 1.1mbs
<drfsupercenter> 03<Xanbreon> Should have checked the requirements <- she said the demo ran "OK"
<drfsupercenter> 03but then actual online matches lagged LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03and this is why laptops sucks
<drfsupercenter> 03-s
<drfsupercenter> 03if she had a desktop I'd be like "go buy a better GPU"
<Ascendant> my laptop is good though ):
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> although the cpu isn't the best
<drfsupercenter> 03it's also new
<drfsupercenter> 03she has some $300 Dell
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Ascendant> lmao

<Ascendant> the speakers in this laptop

<Xanbreon> Actually, im supprised the demo ran better than online
<Xanbreon> AI must take less cpu then online junl
<Xanbreon> junk
<drfsupercenter> 03probably
<Drake> 04?
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think it was the CPU
<drfsupercenter> 03but the graphics
<drfsupercenter> 03the demo is only two parts of one level
<drfsupercenter> 03so maybe the other levels needed more power
<Xanbreon> L4D etc and source games in general are quite cpu heavy
<Xanbreon> Due to all the physics and stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03I know LL's laptop could run the "normal" levels, but for Cold Stream it crapped out and froze
<drfsupercenter> 03but EW ONBOARD GRAPHICS
<drfsupercenter> 03on *any* computer, desktop or laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03:(
<Ascendant> lmao
<Xanbreon> Ah, probs running out of ram etc
<drfsupercenter> 03I buy my crap with no onboard chips
<Ascendant> mine isn't onboard graphics
<drfsupercenter> 03if possible
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Ascendant> I think
<drfsupercenter> 03yours is hybrid
<drfsupercenter> 03onboard/dedicated
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03AMD mobile does that
<drfsupercenter> 03my sister's Dell is the same way
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03for somer eason
<drfsupercenter> 03her Dell
<drfsupercenter> 03uses the onboard for *Everything*
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to manually add crap to the list to use dedicated
<Ascendant> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03and just added IE and Skype as that's all she uses
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03College female = Facebook + Skype
<drfsupercenter> 03but eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I was the one who insisted that she get a "good" laptop
<Ascendant> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03she'd be fine with some $200 Acer crap
<drfsupercenter> 03She's like "you're a computer person, just find me a laptop"
<drfsupercenter> 03OK, Dell whatever that's about $1100
<drfsupercenter> 03it was the only 15" with a numpad
<drfsupercenter> 03EW LAPTOPS WITH NO NUMPADS
<Ascendant> ew numpads
<drfsupercenter> 03even though the XPS was better specs
<drfsupercenter> 03no numpads
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually use the numpad quite a bit
<Ascendant> the one I have now has a numpad
<Ascendant> I hate it
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate you
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just anal and refuse to give up a numpad
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I went for a 15" screen and not 13-24
<drfsupercenter> 03*14
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd be fine with a 13-14" laptop but meh, I want a numpad
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> I should be writing my essay
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Windows XP
<Ascendant> not playing games
<drfsupercenter> 03"Does this computer connect to the INternet?" *skip setup* "Would you like to activate online?"
<drfsupercenter> 03Um, if I didnt'set up a connection, HOW
<Ascendant> lmao
<Ascendant> xp uses magic
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ascendant> it hacks into the nearest network by itself
<drfsupercenter> 03at least Vista/7 don't ask you to activate it automatically
<drfsupercenter> 03it just does it in the background
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03XP was like ACTIVATE ME PLX
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a working crack though
<drfsupercenter> 03for XP
<drfsupercenter> 03works on any service pack/version, never had probs
<Ascendant> There's lots of working keys for XP
<drfsupercenter> 03well;
<drfsupercenter> 03keys != activation
<drfsupercenter> 03for example
<drfsupercenter> 03that key I gave you for Windows 7
<drfsupercenter> 03"works"
<drfsupercenter> 03but it won't activate
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you abuse their phone system
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03with XP, I'm lazy and just run a batch file
<drfsupercenter> 03to do it
<Ascendant> you abused their phone system rather quickly
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03because I've done it a lot
<drfsupercenter> 03you just punch the numbers in and type in what they give you
