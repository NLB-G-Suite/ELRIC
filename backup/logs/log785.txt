<pony_9151> Better nerf twilight
<cachi01> if you think it well......trixie didnt cheat.....she used a magic enhancer amulet its like saying hey that guy has a lvl 100 master sword and he defeated me he is cheating
<Coolbond> was that a cylon?
<Kotano> yes,it is
<pony_9398> Cylon?!
*Panda sighs
<AppleLove> I was hoping trixie would move to ponyville
<pony_8134> so awesome
<DashWithRainbows> Oi
<Ribbons> Biggest EVER pet shop.
<Talakor> WTF, cyclon?
<CradeElcin> I thought Zecora was teaching her illusion magic
<VenHur> That was SO unexpected in the end, yet character development is GREAT in the episode!
<SirTornado> TWILIGHT IS FOURTH WALL BREAKER
<valoreins> R63 spell is just a trick... but it's not impossible right? :3

<CradeElcin> but yeah
<fluttercry> 05,15WHY DID YOU MAKE HER GOOD!
<Eichhorn> Now I can fap to male mane 6 without any guilt
<Meanwhile> Now she's obnoxious in a way that doesn't look like she's trying to be, and that's forgivable.
<Dj> the eoisode was cool
<PonySwaggRevenge> used Trixie's own tricks against her
<Crazy> oh... ok thanks
<neigh> ON THE INSIIIDE
<MischeviousGremlin> WINDOWS reference

<pony_929> that was a pretty solid episode, though. Best this season.
<Sneaks> So....what was "the 6" on there?
<Don-is-Justice> <PON-3> Anything that makes you GAK:D
<pwnyy> NO, it was megan who wrote it
<Cgeta> I thought it was illusion as well
<[GER]Voigt> What about Snips and Snail, are they still babys? I didn't see that they turned back in the End.
<Naxell> played
<Ninoyiya_Ryu> And it turns out that Big Mac likes being Applejack
<Ragnano> 11/10 just for trixie
<joshman130> there was no gak ;_;
<Conyst> I saw no Twist.
<Deacon> everyone's all hollering about the episode, and I'm just sitting here laughing at you all for taking it serously

<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> Can you forgive me?
<Big_Jake-intosh> Best episode ever can't wiat to watch it again ^_^
<crazitaco> i dont :O
<VenHur> Once a former villain now becamed a friend of Trixie!
<RainShadow> Interesting that they didnt tell us AT ALL who those horses were! foreshadowing i guess!
<Jmo> <3
<Derpy_Hooves> James22: good riddince if you ask me :|
<cadpig1099> Second RD was Fluttershy
<TheRealFluttersserti> also, the dota reference at the beginning was hilarious
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> YEs.

<Derpyofderpy> Pinkie confirmed for God of Sleight of Hand.
<Gaston> Nerds are awesome

<Corelis> Will watch again/10
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> bt
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I can get behind "arrogant but not too bitchy"

<Ingwaz> cachi01: if you challenged someone to a duel based on your skill allow and you used a magic sword that enhanced your abilities like crazy, thats cheating
<GingerSnap> I thought it was harry potter
<Brony_1337> GAK GAK GAK
<pony_1218> ikr
<CaptainBlue808> Think I'm gonna bail
<CradeElcin> except pinkie
<midnightslasher> bye everypony see you later maybe!?!?
<vIRCio-3093> best episode of the season
<FlutterNOTthecword> PINKIE*
<Stemglass> it was ok
<Keleseth> The two horses are from Saddle Arabia!
<Ninjazz> Ingwaz, that's not a redeeming quality. They added the few things that we thought they never would have touched. They didn't even need to go directions. THEY DIDN'T NEED TO.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Is Meanwhile burying the proverbial hatchet?
<Destroyer9283> XD Seth
<lunasniperz> male apple jack
<holyblaze0175> and playing with dolls
<anony> Tony_Brony: agreed
<AttackWithHugs> Deacon, I bet Seth is fucking ripping his hair out
<Artiago> the dog is nothing like Twilight personality wise >.>
<pony_9151> Better nerf Twilight
<GingerSnap> *in the beginging

<AJIsAwesome> inb4 it's everyone's favorite episode of S3
<Dazzle> Buh-Lythe
<Eichhorn> I found only Spaceballs references
<bronypoet> viva la nierd
<Derpyofderpy> EVERYONE IS A NERD
<pony_6300> I like Trixie,

<ymom2> Yes
<TS42> so they AREN'T showing it again?
<DashWithRainbows> AJIsAwesome until next ep.
<Pinkies_imagination> WAIT! DID THEY EXPLAIN THE DOUBLE RAINBOW DASH?
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile finally admitting his love for trixie?
<Ribbons> Shoot.
<hatcat> Yeah, I thought too much fandom service at first. It's what made me dislike the start. but the ending is sooo good, I forgive the begining
<DanielsMind1> Episode
<Tri333> this episode was amazing
<pony_6300> She is cool,
<Flamingnoka> i didnt see derpy :(
<Gaston> Zecora helps Twilight open the chakras
<midnightslasher> bye friends!

<Meanwhile> Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
<RainShadow> keleseth: actually youre probably right!
<AJIsAwesome> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Top> WHAT WAS THE STARR WARS REFERENCE?!
<Cheesypoof> yeh
<Ragnano> that episode was like... good

<Vuld> What reports...
<cachi01> Ingwaz: well she never said ''no magic enhancers ok?''
<Conyst> Pinkie open the portal to Equestria.
<Meanwhile> I can feel it. The hate's leaving me.
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: ?
<neigh> WITNEY
<Cgeta> Its the most balanced episode
<Cheesypoof> flutter dash
<Slam_Jam> :P
<Ingwaz> Ninjazz: i wasnt saying it was redeeming, on the contrary actually
<twilight_sprinkle> that was implied
<Namidadream> YEAH
<CriticKitten> Yeah, the redemption bit actually RUINS the episode for me.
<pony_9151> that would be awesome
<Meanwhile> I can't detest the pony.
<N3F4str10> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBoTcHOzOU
<Shadec> Like Gary motherbucking Oak?
<PonySwaggRevenge> Guys... seriously?
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: YES, I WANT HIM TO SUFFER :D
<[GER]Voigt> Yes Fluttershy was second RD
<pony_6300> And i do not care about haters,
<RedRookieRebel> Great episode
<Aoshima> Yeah, Trixie switched back too quickly.
<MischeviousGremlin> i would of expected epic troll
<Flamingnoka> did anyone see derpy?
<Ninjazz> Goddamnit, Meanwhile.
<JRP2234> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Sloveniafag1> Was that Dota 2 at the begining with the merchant?
<Trollestia> That was insane
<midnightslasher> how do i log out
<Keleseth> GET READY FOR ALADIN EPISODE!
<hatcat> Some great flutteryshy bits
<Ninjazz> You failed me.
<FlutterNOTthecword> yeah after too many pinkie pies, i got a bit sick of pinkie
<Java> I can imagine the flood of fanarts this week alone
<PepperGirl> Yeah, they did explain the double Rainbow Dash. :)
<RainShadow> Top: Zecora was pretty much Yoda
<pony_8134> the great and apologetic trixie
<PonyBean> i bet trixie and the manehatten crusaders is gonna help fight the next villan
<RarityLove> Sweetie Belle as Filly Raritie = <3 ;)
<twiluna> great episode, have reservations on the ending though
<Vuld> When was the last time they sent a letter anyway...
<Lasharus> Oh well, I'm off for now. Laters all. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Shh, they'll know!
<JRP2234> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<BladedWings> Pinkies_imagination: it was fluttershy lol
<Punkie_Pue> I didn't.
<Trollestia> I thought it was pretty good.
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> Forgiveness overrules Justice
<Ingwaz> cachi01: it was a test of skill and ability, it shouldnt have to be said
<pony_1334> that was the best episode EVER
<lunasniperz> for me trixie is too anyoing it wants me to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger 50 times
<mega_brony> puppy twilight hair
<Tyranoman> But the "i'll be better thing" happened in boast busters
<twilight_sprinkle> she ran off and still is her rival
<Ribbons> lol Dazzle
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Lasharus. :)
<jangledorf> I didn't mind the apology
<pony_9151> I will be back!
<hatcat> I loved when she threatened Twilight xD
<Blaze> Pinkies_Imagination: It was FLuttershy
<VenHur> We need more Trixie appearances, I mean, Trixie's a good mare now!
<Yay_8> Trixie will be back!!:|
<CountDoofus> N3F4str10: No video links during a stream, please
<Dj> who is talking here is there any ghosts ?
<LooptyHoop> there was a Cylon, a Battle Star Galactica reference
<diyonysus> trixie faceplant at the end is the best lol
<turtlegod98> she is now nice.
<Deacon> seeya Lasharus
<MischeviousGremlin> after twilight accepts apology she yells LOLNAH and runs off
<J_E_Smith71> Trollestia: Techincally is its Rule 63 since it was Big Mac>
<Storm_Flicker> autotune
<SaxyPretender> 0,14we'll try t show the new ep after Euro Movie Night
<Yoghurt_Boom> she apologized but she's still a dick
<PepperGirl> It was Fluttershy disguised as Rainbow Dash.
<RainShadow> the whole seen was a big homage to the yoda scene
<Rartiyfan323> see you all next week
<CriticKitten> She was a thorough bitch for the entire episode. Suddenly, "can you forgive me" "sure". NO.
<N3F4str10> okei
<neigh> CAKEY IS MY BEST FRIEND, I GET TO DECIND WHEN HE DIIIIIES
<PonySwaggRevenge> Lookit man
<pony_6300> Yes she is,
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> They'll ambush her RIGHT as she leaves town
<Top> RainShadow oh fair enough
<Stemglass> I really think the episode should have been a 2 parter and that Sombre had possessed her.
<LooptyHoop> oh there he is
<ParadoxZero> GAA Trixie!!!
<Shmob> I really hope they make celestia scootaloo
<ImaDolphin> Granny Applejack is granny smith?
<Michael> later everypony :)
<DashWithRainbows> AJIsAwesome People say "Best ep evar" when the episode just aired, it will be the same for nextweek.
<Valvad> I like the Trixie/Twilight friend comics and stuff like that, and it reminded me of those
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Yeees. Feel the indifference flow through you.
<Storm_Flicker> 4e\\\
<Shore> I get the feeling they just wanted to be done with Trixie.
<Trollestia> J_E_Smith71: That's what I said
<Otherness> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KprpJmgvpww&feature=g-subs-u Mr poiniator is already on it :P

<Alchemist> I loved Fluttershy in this one.
<brony_655321> So....there go most of the Sombra head-canons...
<AnotherUnknownBrony> As I remember the pinkie episode
<MotionParadox> Well she did tear the entire town apart and torture everypony
<Orkfaeller> hope they'll use the horses/arabia again in a future episode
<DashWithRainbows> next week*
<Ninjazz> Ingwaz, I'm way too pissed off to think clearly.
<Sundaysmile> trixie's all about the limelight
<Eli> If we push enough they might change the end, like they changed the derpy episode
<fluttercry> 05,15I wanted her to stay evil for the fanboy tears
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Michael
<PonySwaggRevenge> This ending is ending
<TheDerpamon> But she was still forgiven
<Spoiler> Fluttershy was Rainbow? XD

<PonySwaggRevenge> So I like it.
<VenHur> Wouldn't you imagine seeing Twilight and Trixie kicking asses on the same screen?!
<Buytoast> reddit is awful anyways
<MischeviousGremlin> she is an egotistical dick
<efdfa> ?
<Ingwaz> Ninjazz: you need to not take things so seriously
<Spamish2> Bye everyone
<Writer_Block> Nope.
<Brony_1337> I hope that rumor of Twilight becoming an Alicorn is a hoax
<Namidadream> Trixie was so cute when she tripped at the ending :)
<otakon> me too
<jangledorf> no
<Keleseth> Aladin Reference episode!
<PonySwaggRevenge> 11/10

<XAce1337manX> way
<The_Si> "But I broke you..."
<Dazzle> So they use an advanced robot to guard a pet shop
<AC4> wow that guy is so fast
<Derpyofderpy> NO
<Acronym> nah
<KrazyNoobs> 75/10
<AJIsAwesome> Trixie=Bane, Twilight=Batman.
<N3F4str10> Starwars too
<ROFLPIZZA> Wait a second guys.
<Gaston> YUS
<Storm_Flicker> nanananananananananann batman
<Kammerjunk> ...In some ways, I kind of preferred the old Trixie.
<Nittany_Discord> Enjoy the episode?
<Pale_Horse> Pixelkitties already did that joke. :P
<Stemglass> Now I'm imagining Trixie with Bane's voice x.x
<Derpyofderpy> BAD COMPARISON
<m> Celestia: You were evil, but not "banish to the moon" evil, so you're free to go!
<Tovler> Trixie should have used Jafar puns before she used that magic.
<ShatteringAmbiance> YES! They do!
<RainShadow> orkfaeller: they better! you just dont throw horses in an ep and never bring them back! haha
<Ribbons> Evil robot.
<PAK215> Al Qaeda reference episode!
<Lasharus> I quite enjoyed watching, and that's all that matters to me. :P
<PepperGirl> Yup
<Alchemist> *chirp*
<Tobiwan> ...
<Grissess> Yeah.
<pony_929> Also, the term alicorn is now csnon.
<SnipsandSnails> Trixie trip is best trip
<cachi01> :| <---- she appologized.....
<pony_9459> amulet=witchweed

<PonyBean> gotta make dem babies
<wv> fuck
<CradeElcin> remember who is also a show-off and is about being admired all the time? Yeah, Rainbow Dash
<PonySwaggRevenge> lol
<Polydunami> I liked how Pinkie was cut off by the credits before she could talk.
<holyblaze0175> ahhaaaa spelling
<joshman130> I r confus
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> I wanted her to stay evil becuase Redemption sucks
<twilight_sprinkle> yup
<pony_9398> ahhhhh
<Gaston> DDUUUUNNNNNNNN
<GameTaco> Yeah, they succeeded. Trixie and Twilight *can* still be on equal terms now, and they're kinda friendly. Yes, it's another "Why did they have to cheat?" ending, but it was done *well*.
<Graywolf71b> That was one of the best endings yet
<wv> i missed it
<Ponymon> Trixie apologizing didn't come out of nowhere. That definitely was warranted, and she DOES respect Twilight. Stop being dissatisfied with material that doesn't fit your favorite fanfic!
<Xps3ubox60wii> i did
<Meanwhile> I'm gonna go...without something to draw my ire I find myself becoming unusually serene. At that's just wrong.
<Kotano> *crickets*
<ROFLPIZZA> They were clearly horses.
<Ninjazz> Bleh.
<Brony_1337> dat gak
<AlienWarhead> No spam
<jangledorf> alicorn is cannon now
<Java> The time constraint
<Gearwork> Trixie is joker
<wv> fml
<Keleseth> Well, soon we will have the Arabian Nights episode.
<Fluttermadness> dat vid xD
<dunderbutt> INSTABAN
<pony_6300> Love for everypony:|
<Talakor> "YOU DON'T FEEEAR DEATH. YOUR PUNISHMENT MUST BE MORE GREAT AND POWERFUL!"
<Storm_Flicker> gak gak fdoas
<wowviewer> The only thing I wish was that episode to be a 2 parter. I think it would of been completely stronger if it had
<N3F4str10> Even Zecora has the same grammar as Yoda
<CradeElcin> so not a good argument
<Stemglass> I liked the Arabian Horses ^^
<Trollestia> Also, did ANYONE notice the word ALICORN?
<pony_1334> i wish they re-streamed it
<Spoiler> It was only like the best episode ever
<Don-is-Justice> Can't wait for Apologetic and Great Trixie Artwork.
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> Voice
<Xps3ubox60wii> that was a troll moment
<anony> im back
<CriticKitten> Agreed. The apology just blew it.
<pony_300> it kinda is; bane basically kicked batman out of gotham. Trixie kicked Twilight out of Ponyville
<ParadoxZero> yeah
<Artiago> best episode
<pony_9398> That'd be cool, actually.
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> ooo ooo turn me into a filly!
<dunderbutt> PERMABAN
<pony_4437> Lol banhammer
<Ingwaz> fluttercry: shes only slightly less of a bad person than she was previously. shes still clearly really stuck on herself, she just apologized for rampaging through the town. had she not apologized, celestia might have punished her
<PonySwaggRevenge> Much stronger indeed
<SaxyPretender> 0,14room's will be muted...now
<Silver_Spoon> Nah, Twixie isn't cnaon
<pony_9398> Arabian Nights.
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> talk about batman more
<hatcat> Don't forget the Saddle Arabian ponies!!!!!!!
<CountDoofus> Ah, so those ponies next to Celestia were Saddle Arabian ponies then?
<Deacon> what's wrong with redemption?
<ImaDolphin> e.e
<Ingwaz> DUNGEON! 9000 YEARS!
<XAce1337manX> Alicorn is canon
<Silver_Spoon> *canon
<Derpyofderpy> that's a bad comparison
<PonySwaggRevenge> like I said
<GameTaco> Back to main chat then>
<Talakor> OK!
<AlienWarhead> :|
<PonySwaggRevenge> They don't have enough time
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile: not hating Trixie anymore? *insert IT'S HAPPENING VID HERE*
<Jet> Loved that trip at the end
<Keleseth> Most likely
<Sneaks> Saddle Arabia lol

<fluttercry> 05,15Hell has frozen over
<Pale_Horse> I thought the Saddle Arabia horses ahd a cool design. :)
<RainShadow> CountDoofus: possibly!
<Top> Arabian Knights
<Shore> I ship Twixie, but I don't try to look into the show for "proof"
<CriticKitten> The episode was doing okay, but the ending was rushed and the apology is fucking stupid. >_>
<Jmo> Thanks everyone for being so calm and well behaved.
<XAce1337manX> 4th wall breaking is spreading
<DashWithRainbows> Deacon Considering how much she done, she shouldn't have it.
*anony turns _xXiaoDrag0n_ into a flly

<holyblaze0175> that was crazy!
<Buytoast> there is no hope now
<Gaston> Saddle Arabia
<anony> 3.5 wall
<Braviary> They didn't really need to be there.
<pony_6300> ture ^
<knightmare> Holy crap it didn't cross my mind but the term Alicorn is now canon!
<Ingwaz> it would have been better had trixie had more trouble brining herself to apologize
<PonySwaggRevenge> Dude
<Kammerjunk> Well, I have to go be social.
<Tobiwan> no cutie marks and they look like horses
<derpyface> FORSAHDOWING
<PonySwaggRevenge> That was fkn awesome
<otakon> FOR THE HELL OF IT!
<RainShadow> as much as i would love more songs :P
<AlienWarhead> puns
<derpyface> FORSHADOWING
<KrazyNoobs> inb4 cancelled because of Arabian

<Kotano> DitzyDerpy15: And Celestia's voice :)
<Grissess> We covered this too: the dog is Twilight Barkle.
<Trollestia> knightmare: I KNOW RIGHT
<brony_655321> Never explained the reason they arrived...
<Yoghurt_Boom> very little horses I'd say
<BroPony|MEDIC> hai everypony :)
<KrazyNoobs> Yes
<pony_9398> i missed the beginning, and it was still great.

<holyblaze0175> ya I think so too
<CountDoofus> Shizuschlafen: Sub-plot.
<MischeviousGremlin> celestia was overseas
<Don-is-Justice> Saddle Arabian Pony is NOT best pony.D:
<eastcoastbrony> Photo Finish i did like. lol.
<neigh> galebreak
<GotPonies> mind blown
<NASCARFAN160> real horses
<pony_9151> i hope
<pony_boop> Doggle is better than barkle btw
<pony_boat> Because they could???
<Alchemist> No. They need new toys.
<MischeviousGremlin> thats why
<pony_6319> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMMPcCLjGMA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUsGe7wGMc&feature=vmdshb
<sub06905> its G5
<pony_342> Celestia was having peace talks or something. :P
<Stemglass> they are expanding the universe
<Wrek> 05thanks for dropping by the side rooM!
<Ingwaz> Buytoast: well you know...it could easily just be that this is one of the possible outcomes that a return of trixie would have brought
<kully6745> obama bin laden
<pony_4956668> overarching storyline
<neigh> hi wrek
<dustint96> toys
<Wrek> 05the mane room is now unlocked
<Jet> They were put there so that Twilight would not have access to Celestia
<ya> waiting for transcripts:)
<Phase4> New toys: Arabian ponies
<PoniiAndii> and why was Celestia there?
<GotPonies> set up
<InspiraX1234> G5 lol
<Gaston> Because more fanfic
<Reallylikehermane> Toy revenue
<RainShadow> this oceans 11 reference
<GingerSnap> The beginning was totally the wand shop scene from Harry Potter
<Gaston> s
<SirGanjalf> Because Animator was bored.
<J_E_Smith71> I liked how Twilight outsmarted Trixie instead of beating her with some magic charm power up
<Wrek> 05so we will be lockign up side rooms
<PonySwaggRevenge> Peace talks
<Tovler> and best of all, Derpy wasn't in this episode.
<alicupcake1235> hey everypony :)
<pony_9151> just for fun
<AlienWarhead> puns and toys
<Ingwaz> Buytoast: its not even necessarily fan pandering
<Kampfkeks007> true
<Obsidian> Foreshadowing
<GingerSnap> *I think
<Agrold> they had to make an excuse for celestia not beeing there and stoping trixie
<anony> G5 foreshadowing
<Jet> Cause she was visiting another country
<ROFLPIZZA> Or a cheesy spinoff show.
<SpeedyBolt> They have to make an episode about Saddle Arabia, or the ponies
<fluttercry> 05,15Buytoast it's not that bad. Sure there was fanservice, but it's not to terrible places yet
<richfiles> I LOVE the Saddle Arabian horses!!!
<TheSplixer72> Other regions other than Equestria are now Canon.
<Trollestia> J_E_Smith71: :D
<PonyRock> for lulz
<pony_6300> We are all arabs, we come whit peace, and love, we mean no harm to you peapole,
<Eli> like chrystal ponies?
<neigh> okay im switching now
<GameTaco> Hopefully they turn the sound back on at the end of the episode. Tabitha voices Zoe's sister, and yes, she uses Rarity's voice.
<VenHur> Some of my favorite new spells pf this episode inculde the following: Age Spell, Clone Spell, Rule 63 Spell.
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Nah, I saw the highest form of it in Too Many Pinkie Pies.
<LeshyJr> /join #bronystate.ru
<Slam_Jam> let's talk about Saddle Arabia :D
<SirGanjalf> Oh, and toys, ofc
<Ribbons> It was fake.
<wowviewer> You know, after seeing her like that, I wonder if she'll show up again, but instead of showing off or causing trouble, she'll help
<PonyRock> THEY DID IT FOR LULZ
<VenHur> Who agreeds?!
<Kinixys> Did they have cutie marks?
<hen3ry> why create new breed? Toy $$$s
<Ninjazz> Yet?!
<LeshyJr> /join #bronystate.ru

<Gaston> All of my yes
<Ingwaz> go borrow rarity's couch
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> Saddle Arabian Gulf War
<Trollestia> Kotano: Yeah, the toy ponies will look correct this time around.
<Silver_Spoon> Carnival ponies :3
<anony> 9/11 fanfic
<AJIsAwesome> Too Many Pinkie Pies had the largest amount of fanservice as of now, IMO.
<BaconMane> 0,5And as always hev neic dey
<eastcoastbrony> Twilight is a smart pony and said. "hmm. Magic not so much. Deception may work".
<DitzyDerpy15> Twilight DOg
<VenHur> Alright, see you in the main room!
<GotPonies> it was for the oil
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> Saddle Arabian riots
<DitzyDerpy15> >
<dunderbutt> fluttershy's what was the best part
<Yoghurt_Boom> Paddlestan
<cachi01> i wonder if LPS has a fandom.
<DitzyDerpy15> ? lol
<Tobiwan> rarijack
<Obsidian> So much fanfic
<Storm_Flicker> meh true...
<KrazyNoobs> arabian ponies make me cry
<GotPonies> lol
<Rappafoin> So Twilight can't contact Celestia
<ardias> TURRIST
<Welsh_Pony> Maybe those ponys had something to do with the book at the end with the season 3 opening
<Trollestia> eastcoastbrony: ZECORA
<ya> Ah need to grab a bite.Bye guys:)
<PonySwaggRevenge> On that note
<lunasniperz> i want another james bond referance

<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> Ponistan
<RedRookieRebel> really awesome epic episode
<Storm_Flicker> I FUCKING HATE SHIPINGS
<eastcoastbrony> yup!
<[GER]Voigt> What about Snips and Snail, are they still babys? I didn't see that they turned back in the End.
<pony_6319> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMMPcCLjGMA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUsGe7wGMc&feature=vmdshb
<Deacon> maybe niche, who knows
<jangledorf> every episode spawns a ton of fanfiction
<Grissess> Twilight could never contact Celestia. Spike does.
<scout19_tf2> boooooooo shiping is invalid
<RealJigga> Aj is now a stallion, your argument is invalid
<PonySwaggRevenge> I don't fkn care what anyone else says
<Yut> bye
<fluttercry> 05,15This had way more fanservice than too many pinkie pies
<Bucksaw> don't forget about spike x fluttershy
<Nerevars> waiting for the fanfiction about redeemmed trixie
<pony_1334> Hear that sound? It's the sound of a million pieces of fanfiction dissolving into sweet, sweet tears.
<VenHur> Hi guys! I'm back in the main room! And OH. MY. GOD!
<jangledorf> it's nothing new
<Stemglass> Neighran?
<KrazyNoobs> BYE EVERYPONY

<pony_1218> I love Twilight x Trixie
<GotPonies> Itrot
<DashWithRainbows> and kills many jangledorf.
<PonySwaggRevenge> Bainao.
<sub06905> like saxy said all the fan art of fluttershy with her teddy bear
<SpeedyBolt> Sombra was good...but...
<VenHur> That was one of the best episodes!
<Don-is-Justice> How the heck can there be a terrorist attack on Ponyville? There's NO PLANES!:>
<kully6745> sombrero
<Stemglass> Neighraq?
<lunasniperz> same thing
<Sheep2Heaven> this show is freaking me out
<pony_6319> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMMPcCLjGMA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUsGe7wGMc&feature=vmdshb
<Vordox> fluttercry: They kinda "missed" a few things. :P
<Pale_Horse> There's going to be a lot of alteration of TV Tropes pages now that the term "Alicorn" is more or less canon. ;)
<DarkChaos17010> the door knows everything
<Deacon> there was fanservice in too many pikie pie?
<TheSplixer72> Sombra had NO CHARACTER DEVOLPMENT
<scout19_tf2> bye KrazyNoobs
<Vordox> But...
<DashWithRainbows> It also kills my head canon
<SirGanjalf> Sombra is a dissapointing villain, imho
<Storm_Flicker> this epidsode screwed up the cannon
<ROFLPIZZA> Neighman.
<Talakor> Ponystien was just recently recognized by canterlot as a non-member observer state
<Rappafoin> Not with the force field around
<pony_1334> All fanfic about trixie are ruined
<Bronystuff> Best episode.
<SpikeLulz12> Waiting for the Other Ending Were Twilight does NOT Forgive Trixie
<Vordox> Bronies want more
<Tovler> That should've been a Sombra amulet with him posessing Trixie
<Shmob> See you next week, guys!
<PonyRock> I like Neighraq
<anony> Sombra is a boss
<VenHur> I mean, TRIXIE IS NOW A GOOD FRIEND OF TWILIGHT NOW!
<Vordox> THey get more
<Vordox> They complain
<pony_1334> s
<AppleLove> I facepalmed when she "turned" applejack into a stallion.
<VenHur> HAWLY SHEET!

<SpeedyBolt> He had little screen time
<ImaDolphin> :)
<PonyBean> sombra and the door.
<Trollestia> Pale_Horse: THE NAME IS TOTALLY CANON

<Ribbons> Twilight and Trixie are friends now :)
<Vordox> <----- Radio = Spoilers much? :P
<otakon> THREE EPISODE!?
<anony> WHY DID EVRYONE FORGOT DISCORD
<ROFLPIZZA> This episode was much better than the Crystal Empire episodes.
<Ponymon> Wasn't Sombra confirmed as being dead and gone for good?
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> And
<Masterballer> I like Trixie x Trixie
<Phase4> three parter?
<Ingwaz> Vordox: thats how fandom works
<DocSane2> They're on friendly terms now, if not actual friends.
<Teren> smobrero is a bad villian
<crazitaco> but they didn't actually turn applejack male. it was just Big Mac painted XD
<fapplebloom> i hate trixie, but that was pretty fucking great
<cachi01> so movie?
<pony_1218> Omg
<otakon> anony: bc he's STONE
<VenHur> Three parter?! THREE parter?!

<Kotano> Crystal Saddle Arabian Ponies
<pony_300> SAPECUALTIONS FOR EVERYONE

<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> The Ponies are mutated
<Obsidian> Just rumors everypony
<XAce1337manX> Could be,
<Nittany_Discord> Head to main chat, please.
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: I can see the R63 thing as a massive fan pandering, but not really the cloning and age changing.
<ROFLPIZZA> Shoulda been the pilots.
<Grissess> Discord is a statue now.
<RealJigga> i didnt like discord imo
<Namidadream> I was so exited when Twilight turn AJ into a male... I thought it was going to be the other mane six aswell :D
<Spoiler> 3 parter?
<PonySwaggRevenge> fapplebloom - Agreed.
<Gaston> Same here
<Teren> yea
<Tobiwan> what did twilight even learn anything from zecora?
<Kampfkeks007> that'd be cool
<XAce1337manX> Only 10 episodes known,
<Stemglass> One Bad Apple, still best episode of the Season
<Ralathon> They never said it didn't
<ImaDolphin> What
<Ingwaz> Vordox: we ask for something, you dont do it exactly how i want it to, and then i rage.
<Teren> i thought it would to
<pony_26> my bosy will be ready
<Yut> oh god a three parter?
<Gaston> But ALLICORNS
<PAK215> I would've been a bit disappointed if it did.
<Sundaysmile> it looks like dark magic so it's kinda a theme for this season
<AC4> yeah, what happend with the horn?
<lunasniperz> discord inventing a gun called the wather ppk
<pony_1vs2> who is sombra, already forgot
<CriticKitten> I had hoped it would.
<anony> otakon: april fools special
<Storm_Flicker> this episode actually BOMBED the cannon
<XAce1337manX> 3 parter possible

<Ingwaz> Vordox: of course, everybody tends to want something slightly different
<FndF> Sombra doesn't even have wings...
<Mamoru> IT'S GAK GAK GAK
<pony_9102> it's gak gak ak
<Mamoru> GAK GAK GAK
<jangledorf> this is actually my favorite episocde so far
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> VOICES TALK ABOUT DISCORD
<Namidadream> exactly
<Tovler> it would've make Sombra like Aku, but that would've been ok
<Storm_Flicker> maybe spike is a player
<Artiago> GAK GAK GAK
<pony_68> When Applejack was 'turned' into a stallion... The fanart in that!
<hen3ry> IIRC, the definition of "alicorn" in the dictionary is "the horn of a unicorn"
<Nittany_Discord> not closing yet SaxyPretender?
<RealJigga> Sombra got banned
<pony_1vs2> sombra was the worsed villian ever. get over it:P
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> Please
<DashieBro> it's stuff you can mold
<crazitaco> use magic regarless of consequence, in the name of SCIENCE!
<Ingwaz> Vordox: SO WE ALL RAGE!!!
<ROFLPIZZA> DISCORD

<MischeviousGremlin> when are weh gonna see discord again

<Yay_8> sombra didn´t even had screen time
<SnipsandSnails> Poor Snips and Snails...I hope you S&S haters are happy now...
<PonySwaggRevenge> Tobiwan - What Twilight learned was her limits.
<Ingwaz> AJIsAwesome: the r63 was shown to be fake
<Storm_Flicker> I hated that scene
<AmethystStar> Whats the next episode?
<Rainbow-Crash> No alicorn Twilight, please
<Jmo> >_>
<Nittany_Discord> Oh.
<KrazyNoobs> yes
<N3F4str10> So, sombra is more useless than the wonderbolts
<lunasniperz> head cannon male applejack
<GameTaco> Yeah. I won't be upset if Sombrero doesn't come back.
<fapplebloom> slurpees are frozen gak
<AppleLove> Scootaloo next week
<wowviewer> That wasn't AJ. That was Big Mac as AJ lol
<Nittany_Discord> Dammit.
<CriticKitten> I would have been very happy if the amulet was meaningful. The magic LOOKED like Sombra's evil magic.
<jangledorf> mysterious voices, talk about discord
<GingerSnap> I thought twilight was gunna bust out the EoH again...Well played story writers...
<N3F4str10> :S
<Yut> Twilight will be an alicorn in the end of the series
<Conyst> Scoots
<Grissess> SCIENCE IS MAGIC!
<Sneaks> http://www.equestriagaming.com/2012/11/super-smash-ponies-update-3.html#more - Super Smash Ponies. Anyone know of this?
<Brony_1337> They're drinking Gak?
<Storm_Flicker> OH YEAH!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Ingwaz: I know, but the idea of it was a fanpandering to me.
<ROFLPIZZA> Oh wait, they can't see us.
<Ribbons> CCRRRRYYYSSSSSSTTALLLL
<texasboykc09> lol
<gameleon> we have 4 episodes not yet known....
<Artiago> gender swap is cannon :o
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo, now that Trixie is on the good side, should we see more of her in future episodes? Like cameos, and possibly another episode?
<AC4> 3 episodes on 1 day, that would be awesome!
<xuincherguixe> Hope it is Discord.
<CriticKitten> If it's just a one off, that's just another failure for this season.
<Acronym> what about episode 8
<Ingwaz> i can understand the anger about the redemption, but the r63 thing is just ridiculous
<Ribbons> HEEEEEAARRRTT.
<eastcoastbrony> scootaloo next week?? yes!
<Truce> Peyton is best bony
<ROFLPIZZA> We have to be in bronystate.
<pony_1vs2> Sombra died right?
<sugarponi872> I think I am going to seizure dance to dubstep
<gameleon> 8 is unknown too
<Nittany_Discord> Still getting used to mIRC. Sorry.
<pony_1218> yup
<GameTaco> I don't know. Black and green was Sombra's motif. Red magic is new.
<otakon> oh my GOd
<AmethystStar> Did you guys see Lyra drinking that drink XD without using magic holding it with her hoof
<Ribbons> Oh yeah!
<holyblaze0175> ill say one thing...... Eclipse Celestia.....I want.

<otakon> MrPoniator video si OUT already
<GameTaco> Unless I'm forgetting?
<Nerevars> at last Scootaloo episode next week, hope her background will be clear
<brony_655321> Who the heck is the chick talking?
<GingerSnap> Trixie's good side is now canon
<Ingwaz> AJIsAwesome: it sounds like high level magic to me
<Grissess> Sombra was kinda disintegrated...
<Talakor> DISCOOOOOORD I'M COMIN AFTER YOU, YOU INTERUPTED MY NAP ON A SUMMER AFTERNOOON
<Bon_Bon> Trixie x Trixie

<Talakor> OMG

<Don-is-Justice> GAK is meme. An annoying, but accepted one.
<J_E_Smith71> Of course they didn't give Chrysalis away in any previews, unlike Sombra and all the other stuff they've spoiled this season
<Grissess> Chrysalis is now somewhere out in the forst
<erwrwrwrgtrf5t43gtf> VOICES DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT FRENSHEP

<pony_4281> GAK IS NOT FUNNY!!!!
<KrazyNoobs> Same, it would have been awesome if AJ were a stallion. The producers sure do know how to disappoint, but I loved the episode overall, so. 10/10
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: I had an idea for an episode, you want to hear it, Scoots?
<pony_9526> To clarify: Rule 63 was not made canon - the scene was later revealed to be a smoke and mirrors effect

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Scootaloo is best filly.
<Shore> I don't think it'll get as much hype. Trixie is a Dark horse character
<Bon_Bon> Over a campfire, Rainbow Dash decides to share some imaginative and spooky tales, causing Scootaloo to have frightening, vivid nightmares; Scootaloo wants to get rid of her nightmares but doesn't want the others to think she is spineless
<eastcoastbrony> Ooo.. not sure.. I like trixie/twlight.. maybe this will beat it.

<pony_68> Isn't there a rumor that Sootaloo is an orphan?
<VenHur> Guys, Sweetie Belle used a TINY speck of magic, and Scootaloo can fly now!
<RealJigga> imo :l
<Bon_Bon> Episode after scoots' episode is gonna be alot better
<otakon> odd
<AJIsAwesome> I still have high hopes for this season, so I'm going to wait.
<SnipsandSnails> Sweetie Belle is way cuter than Fluttershy....your argument is invalid
<Shore> she tries too hard to be cool
<PonySwaggRevenge> This episode. Is awesome.
<lunasniperz> luna is my favorite pony but she gets so little screen time :(
<Silver_Spoon> She can fly for brief periods
<Polydunami> No suck thing as a "cynist". It's a CYNIC.
<Grissess> I know, I was perpetuating it :D
<VenHur> Stop whining now...
<PonySwaggRevenge> Bye. ^^
<Namidadream> D: No
<wowviewer> lol

<Tovler> Scootaloo hasn't even had an episode and we're complaining about there being one?

<scout19_tf2> BUCK U DUDE
<CutieMarkCrusaders> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS LIVESTREAMERS YAAAAAAY
<Pinkies4thWall> WHAT
<GameTaco> Theorized plot synopsis: Rainbow Dash camps out with Scootaloo and tells stories of a simpler time, where she used to dress in style. Scootaloo then has horible G3 nightmares.
<Ninjazz> Who said that?
<Tobiwan> yes
<Vordox> ALL BRONIES WHO LIKE RARITY SUCKS
<Pinkies4thWall> NO
<Spoiler> ZOMG Venhun you're right
<sunlight338> well i don't like rainbow dash either but if gilda would take her place i would propably would say sorry come back dash
<PAK215> Rarity is okay.
<jangledorf> hey mods, how long did it take to fix the stream?

<Samui> But I thought you liked whining.

<lunasniperz> luna is still my favorite
<Xps3ubox60wii> hi
<DocSane2> It'd be hilarious if Snips and Snails were still abbies.
<Storm_Flicker> !!!!!!!!!!!
<pony_1143> is the episode finished?
<Tobiwan> right
<wowviewer> That part about Zecora caught me off guard
<pony_9102> MEEp
<pony_9526> Supersonic is defined as the speed of Mach 1 - there's been research implying that Rainbow Dash's top speed peaks at roughly Mach 4.6 prior to the Sonic Rainboom
<Kotano> also,Zebra skull at the beginning,what the fuck oO
<NeonGreenKitten> does anyone have a link to the new episode?
<rextheponydragon> its hard listining to a movie and typeing
<DocSane2> babies
<Tobiwan> I remember that
<GameTaco> The sun never set over the Crystal Empire.
<Pizzafanatic> Meep
<N3F4str10> With these comercials, Gak is even Better
<pony_9102> PMEEp
<SnipsandSnails> I hope you Snips n Snails haters are happy now
<crazitaco> i want more episodes with zecora. seriously
<brony_655321> oooh, plot development.
<Graywolf71b> Considering Snips and Snails are who started her downfall the first time, it figures she'd have it in for them
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, pony_1143
<ImaDolphin> Meep
<GingerSnap> Meep Meep I'm a cloud!
<War> yes plot device, we have already dismissed this claim

<Atherius> cheesus will win
<ZeroBlue4> ZECORA IS A WITCH!
<MadSurge> Deacon: yes, but people were still saying "it's Pinkie's made up story"
<brony_655321> I bless the rains down in Africa...
<wowviewer> Maybe. I mean, Zecora did help out some of the other ponies back then
<dot> SONIC
<AlienWarhead> Zecora had a cameo in the Smile Smile episode
<Storm_Flicker> Rainbow Dash vs F18 vs F22
<rextheponydragon> AWW COMEON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<SnipsandSnails> VenHur EXACTLY
<Gaston> "what a lovely surprise"
<crazitaco> zecora has the best door stops!
<dot> SONIC WILL BEAT RAINBOW
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: What? :S
<fluttercry> 05,15Ponies are canon
<pony_9526> Road Runner would actually win - the physical speed necessary to disperse the surface tension of air would be...astronomical.
<wowviewer> LOL
<RedRookieRebel> DEATH BATTLE
<Deacon> really? why would people think that?
<Xps3ubox60wii> lol
<Paquack> Ever wanted a dead dog's head stitched to your blanket? Introducing Cuddleuppets!

<Obsidian> SHe has awesome doorstopd then

<Deacon> are they that dense?
<rextheponydragon> I MISSED THE BEST EPISODE AND THERE WAS A YOUTUBER ON!!!!!!!!!!??
<Xps3ubox60wii> if i had a house
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Haven't they always?
<Namidadream> NUUUU
<Ponymon> Anyone noticed this episode made Alicorns canon and NOT a fanon name for the Princessess?
<pony_9526> As seen in Road Runner's constant 'running on air'
<Grissess> Wow, already the FiM wiki has the fact that she was seen in Ep5
<cachi01> what is a pony?
<crazitaco> YES
<DerpyDash> I see what they did there..... Saddle Arabia
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: no shitting

<Don-is-Justice> <pony_9526> Buck yes.
<Gaston> YYYEEEAAHHH
<Gaston> NO
<lunasniperz> james bond vs rarity who would win
<rextheponydragon> FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Gaston> Saddle Arabia
<Atherius> zecora is a witch
<pony_9526> So it is written
<aaaaa> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<pony_9526> So it shall be
<twilight_sprinkle> but trixie is awesome
<Zippoman924> yes
<Otherness> is ya missed the episode keep your eye on http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/magic-duel-streamsdiscussiondownload.html
<AlienWarhead> rextheponydragon: wait 30 minutes to a hour
<aniderp> its not on youtube yet :\
<hen3ry> Every morning in Africa, gazelles run away from lions. If the gazelle is not faster than the fastest lion, he is in trouble.
<cowvarkians> eww, ponies
<Silver_Spoon> Is trixie going to be eclipsed like applejack was?
<Nizati> Zacora rox
<otakon> a miserable little pile of friendship?
<Otherness> should be up in an hour or so
<Kammerjunk> Eww, horses.
<Storm_Flicker> James Bond and Rarity work together
<Dalek> Zecora is best zebra.
<VenHur> I know this is a racist idea, but I really want to see an episode with Zecora's species somewhere unknown in an episode.
<crazitaco> i brohoof to day *(\
<Pinkies4thWall> PUNCH ALL THE MONITORS
<DocSane2> Yeah, we kind of noticed that.
<rextheponydragon> ...
<Xps3ubox60wii> gotta love saddle arabia horses
<crazitaco> dat
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: just because Pinkie's like "and that's how equestria was made" at the end
<aaaaa> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<holyblaze0175> no Mac Jack S best
<SailorPegasus> Alicorn is canon!
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<AlienWarhead> HORSES
<sub06905> so the new episode will bring Zecora x Twilight
<Conyst> not new term just canon
<sub06905> :>
<lunasniperz> ummmmmmmmm james bond vs applejack
<Overmare> there werewno gak commercials either
<pony_9526> A 'winged pegasus'?
<xuincherguixe> First time I heard the term Alicorn...
<Xps3ubox60wii> horses
<Graywolf71b> crap that's right
<xuincherguixe> Was Shadowrun.
<Beatfox> the fandom didn't come up with alicorn
<hen3ry> Every morning in Africa, lions chase gazelles. If a lion is slower than the slowest gazelle, he will starve.
<pony_9526> Department of Redundancy Department?
<Conyst> winged pegasus lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14actually, alicorn is the term the studio's been using
<Beatfox> it existed previously
<Polydunami> Wait, Alicorn is canonized? So now it's SAINT Alicorn?
<THEgreenblobofbrony> Crap
<RedRookieRebel> Mustace
<Storm_Flicker> again, they work together
<rextheponydragon> lol
<aaaaa> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<hen3ry> Either way, Africa's not a great place to live
<Stemglass> I've heard the term Alicorn before
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: more like messing with the CMC
<Pale_Horse> the Saddle Arabia hosres had an awesome deign. Even though they were only there for a second or two I still loved them. :)
<xuincherguixe> About... 15 or so years ago.
<lunasniperz> god damn
<Dr_Fumbles> Alicorn is technically supposed to be the name for the substance of their horn
<Aoshima> Well, Alicorn is actually the tissue that makes up a unicorn's horn.
<Xps3ubox60wii> pegasus corn?
<Silver_Spoon> Pegacorn sounds like sky corn
<GingerSnap> Doesn't the hub description on the dvds use the term Alicorn??????
<Deacon> or just being pinkie pie
<RedRookieRebel> Alicorn
<wowviewer> They have been using Alicorn, just not on the show itself
<Graywolf71b> Pegacorn, unipeg
<dot> SONIC VS RAINBOW SONIC WILL WIN http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkgO7mPdQS
<lunasniperz> trixie vs james bond
<GameTaco> Pegasususuesesususeses.
<Silver_Spoon> like corn grown in a cloud
<Beatfox> Alicorn has been used for winged unicorns for at least a couple decades
<Namidadream> I have a picture in my head that Rarity would strangle james bond with fabric..
<brony_655321> I was gonna say, alicorn was in strong use by the staff.
<Don-is-Justice> Somepony found GAK and killed it. That's why the commercials weren't there much.
<Dark_Horst> far as i know alicorn is actual the material unicorn horns consist of
<rextheponydragon> unipeg lol
<eastcoastbrony> See I wasn't sure it was a fandom thing.
<Storm_Flicker> James Bond
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: still, way to make Trixie less bitchy at the end writers! :O
<Pale_Horse> Pegasauruses?
<wowviewer> lol
<Pinkies4thWall> ^
<Zippoman924> pegasus is best fluttershy
<Aoshima> It's not refering to the fandom at all, it's referring to what the amulet is presumably made of.
<Ralathon> Alicorn is the horn of a Unicorn. For some reason it got linked to winged unicorns
<AlienWarhead> horned unicorns
<DocSane2> Beatfox: You sure about that?
<Pale_Horse> Pegasaurus Rex! :O
<Phase4> a Zecora episode would be baws
<rextheponydragon> pegasefarus?
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony, what I miss?
<GameTaco> Pegasaurus Rex.
<Grissess> Pegasaurus?
<AJIsAwesome> ^Y
<dot> SORRY BAD VID http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkgO7mPdQs
<Storm_Flicker> I killed GAL
<VenHur> Actually, Pegasus is REALLY a greek mythology, look at Hercules and you'll see what I mean.
<GameTaco> I approve.
<crazitaco> i love sunil
<Storm_Flicker> *GAK
<AJIsAwesome> ALL MY YES, Phase4.
<Beatfox> yep, it's true
<pony_boat> I missed that part
<rextheponydragon> sure hope i made them laug
<Pinkies4thWall> And the click and drop
<eastcoastbrony> I got back after internets died and say yoda zecora...
<pony_9102> YOU MONSTER
<Otherness> horned unicorns everyone: season 4
<Jageman> winged unicorns are an old idea
<Graywolf71b> i used to call them "unipegasus when I was a kid
<rextheponydragon> fuck i spelt laugh wrong
<AmethystStar> Where was Derpy does anyone know?
<MadSurge> I'd like that too :)
<JT> And the stinger.
<GingerSnap> Trixie deleted system32
<VenHur> As for unicorns, they're like something you see in fairy tales, like that one unicorn from Harry Potter.
<DocSane2> Aoshima: No, the amulet was of a winged unicorn.
<pony_9102> You killed Gak.
<Phase4> WE MUST FEATURE MORE SIDE CHARACTERS
<Don-is-Justice> <Storm_Flicker> You monster-HEY, I was going to sayt that!
<Stemglass> Zeus created sa Pegasus out of a Cloud.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<JT> That was awesome.
<Conyst> hooved earth ponies
<rextheponydragon> pegaselapinus
<pony_4787> where can I watch the episode?
<Tovler> Sunil. like an indian Big Mac
<Atherius> breaking the 4th wall
<Jageman> they show up on family crests from the middle ages
<eastcoastbrony> err. saw.. and was hey that's great!
<Grissess> Trixie actually deleted Pinkie's flash file
<Namidadream> Winged horses
<lunasniperz> even though james bond works for celestia and luna but luna vs james bond
<rextheponydragon> pegafgdrfdrf
<Lionel> Trixie as Bane?
<Lionel> Done
<AlienWarhead> Venhur the show has a lot of Greek mythology like Tartarus
<RealJigga> Blue thing with headphones is best pony
<Lionel> http://theflashguy.deviantart.com/art/The-Magic-340649335
<Kammerjunk> You must construct additional episodes.
<GingerSnap> dat mongoose
<Grissess> There will be no more animation of Pinkie from hereon.'
<rextheponydragon> pega djsszdhnyusjj
<VenHur> And Earth Ponies are just...Earth Ponies...mm'kay.
<Beatfox> Alicorn originally meant the material of a unicorn's horn. Then in the late 20th century, fantasy authors & artists started using it to refer to winged unicorns.
<AusPony> so much magic. its turning into harry potter
<Pale_Horse> I thought Pegasus was born from the spilled blood of Medusa.
<crazitaco> his name is sunil <3
<Xps3ubox60wii> i feel like play cod bo 2 in the bathroom see ya guys
<CurlyQ> 4th wall broken beyond repair XD
<N3F4str10> Look the bad clone of Fluttershy
<Obsidian> Timing
<Graywolf71b> so Zeus created Rainbow Dash?:)
<rextheponydragon> pegafdsszsghjkhgtfrghj
<Stemglass> Cerberus is seen in the show, too.
<cowvarkians> You must contstruct more railings.
<AppleLove> Earth ponies are strongest ponies
<Conyst> Runs around in underwear. Freakazoid Freakazoid
<lunasniperz> discord vs the joker
<Ninjazz> We need more characters.
<holyblaze0175> I like he fact that there experimenting with giving normal ponys princess/ alicorn level powers
<cowvarkians> *construct
<Phase4> i do wish they had a kind of overarching plot in s2 and 3
<dot> SUPER SONIC VS SONICRAINBOOM
<pony_6339> did she even speak in this episode
<aniderp> jaymoo be lurking?
<Grissess> COMING UP NEXT: TWILIGHT SPARKLE AND THE SORCERER'S STONE
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: That's true as well. It would be interesting to see her as a villain instead, but it's also nice to know that she has redemption possibility.
<Phase4> s1 had the gala
<AppleLove> They do control the food
<rextheponydragon> is he pooping?
<LoneBlackhoves> i love that too
<Stemglass> that blue thing looks like he's trying to take a dump?
<pony_1926> Is it coming on in 5 minutes?
<GoldenDerpEgg> Fluttershy= Dot Warner
<GameTaco> Sunil: COBRA is in the building.
<CrystalPhoenix> this is the best part of that episode
<VenHur> I love that Pinkie breaks the 4th wall at the end, but Twilight breaks the wall further!
<Don-is-Justice> <Storm_Flicker> Murder's ok only when it comes to GAK. We all hated GAK Pony, anyways.
<Simon> Cobras
<AlienWarhead> COBRAS
<fluttercry> 05,15Next episode, The mane6 is on vacation so we follow the adventures of Colgate, Lyra, BonBon, Derpy, Doctor Whooves, and Caramel
<VenHur> Like ONE STEP BEYOND!
<eastcoastbrony> yup hehe
<cachi01> what about a episode about pinkie's sister visiting ponyville
<xuincherguixe> I was saying in another channel.
<DerpyDash> Sometimes.....I like to paint my hair green and my body orange and i pretend to be a carrot
<crazitaco> i HATE COBRAS
<Stemglass> Yo Joe!!
<Pinkies4thWall> VenHur: I died that moment.
<VenHur> Cobraaaaaaaaaaaas!
<Sumica> 00,10snakes snakes erey where
<Conyst> his brain is overloaded his head is choclate coated
<crazitaco> don't feed the COBRAS
<xuincherguixe> "That's what happens when Twilight multiclasses as Shaman."
<Phase4> fluttercry, XD
<aaaaa> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<CurlyQ> Those cobras look weird.
<ZeroBlue4> Zecora is a witch!
<Polydunami> I'm out
<pony_9526> Doesn't every episode spawn masses of fanfiction?
<pony_9526> o-O
<Conyst> chocolate*
<Aoshima> DocSane2: Then they used the term wrong. Simple as that. :P
<GingerSnap> snakes....SNAKES!
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: No offense, but why Caramel?
*VenHur raises fist in the air "COBRAAAAAAAAA!!!"
<Phase4> that would be prety amazing
<cachi01> fluttercry: lol
<lunasniperz> i don't get it
<pony_9102> Gak is best! How could you hate Gak!??!
<rextheponydragon> ugh i dont feel well at all
<xuincherguixe> Though technically I suppose Zecora is a wizard.
<DerpyDash> Sometimes.....I like to paint my hair green and my body orange and i pretend to be a carrot
<ZeroBlue4> Burn the witch@
<crazitaco> me too derpydash.
<Conyst> Cobra Kai
<aaaaa> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<fluttercry> 05,15AJIsAwesome because I couldn't think of anymore background ponies, and I like Caramel
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i like this quote "Trixie's a better character when she's a massive bitch."
<rextheponydragon> * staggers and falls*
<holyblaze0175> dat trixie cp out
<Grissess> SNAKES?!
<BlitzWing00> They didn't handle the redemption well.
<Brony_1337> Don't we all :3
<pony_9526> I think it did mark how far Trixie was willing to go to save face
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, but wher is vinyl and Octavy?! DDDDD:
<GingerSnap> Kill ALL the Snakes!

<holyblaze0175> cop out
<pony_1vs2> i loved the redemption because i aprove twixie -.-!
<pony_3998> what is going on...
<pony_boat> It was a redemption, not a change in character
<Zippoman924> had to refresh
<pony_7495> guys, i missed the episode. halp?
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Cheesefox
<Stemglass> Sanke? Snake?! SNAAAAAAAAAKKKEEEE!!

<AlienWarhead> Derpy_Hooves: GREEN HAIR;)
<pony_3998> I MISSED IT GNAAAA
<Grissess> Snake abuse makes me cryface.
<Major> Evening
<Ponymon> Twilight's reaction was her teasing Trixie, not disbelieving her.
<sub06905> lol
<RedRookieRebel> Rock farm
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: it's not the arrogance, it's the rotten attitude that makes me mad! :D
<Artiago> :|
<BlitzWing00> I like the idea of redemption, I just think they could have done it better
<lunasniperz> i think trixie like hitler
<pony_3998> -.-
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Ah, I see. I was going to say that he's not really that popular in the fandom compared to the others.
<GameTaco> Well... Let's put it to a comparison. Was Trixie's redemption better than Babs Seed?
<Cheesefox> ᕦ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᕤ Do you even lift
<VenHur> He REALLY hates cobras, doesn't he...
<Panzermole> is the new ep on youtube yet?
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of Trixie and Star Wars, http://derpy.me/MGRDk
<DerpyDash> I like how at the end.... Trixie Tripped
<lunasniperz> she become too power hungery
<Namidadream> :/
<rextheponydragon> HEY GUYS GUESS WHAT PONY I HAVE A CRUSH ON!?
<Grissess> Trixie didn't fully redeem :3
<fluttercry> 05,15Colgate is best background pony
<CrystalPhoenix> VenHur, yes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14pony_7495, we might do it after Euro night
<CrystalPhoenix> yes he does
<Ponymon> What, you guys don't like Trixie being a good guy?
<Stemglass> Babs' was better. more sincere
<Jmo> Hey, hey Saxy.
<Silver_Spoon> but thou must
<twilight_sprinkle> trixie almost tortured someone with magic, so she felt bad
<Namidadream> ya
<Artiago> it should be on yt in tthe next 2-3 hours
<MadSurge> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I liked her being a bitch for most of the episode :D
<Kotano> rextheponydragon: Spike?
<Grissess> She still has a massive egotistical complex
<Don-is-Justice> lol, rock farm callback. "Get to work moving every rock OFF this damn farm, Trixie!":A
<rextheponydragon> n
<Panzermole> IS THE NEW ep on youtube yet?
<Aoshima> DocSane2: Oh, that's not what I meant. I use "Alicorn" to refer to the princesses all that time. I just meant that it's not necessarily a reference to the fandom.
<holyblaze0175> i like the apology but itcm o as over the top and rushed
<Sodapop> I'm glad the resolution had Trixie redemption, showing that while she is a ham, she isn't an entirely bad pony.
<rextheponydragon> no im a boy
<AJIsAwesome> All background ponies are best background pony.
<Grissess> she just thinks she "made friends"
<VenHur> Ponymon: I do.
<CurlyQ> *trixie dramatically runs away..... then trips.*
<crazitaco> i agree
<cachi01> i dont even want to know what is going to do with that log
<MadSurge> fluttercry: Minuette!
<Tovler> I wish Trixie was more like Raquelle from the Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse series.
<SnipsandSnails> I WANT TO SEE GILDA IN AN EPISODE
<Brony_1337> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4qKF3x7V0 IF YOU MISSED THE EPISODE
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: ?
<GameTaco> Trixie's ego vs. Rainbow Dash's ego. Equestria will be no more.
<pony_9526> Trixie was great as an ambivalent force - a conflicted character
<crazitaco> we need mean characters sometimes
<eastcoastbrony> "I liked her when she was just a fraud". :p
<GingerSnap> EqD is now owned by the Hub XD
<Zippoman924> trixie is epic as evil-ish
<fluttercry> 05,15Colgate Minuette. Problem solved
<rextheponydragon> its one of the mane 6
<Silver_Spoon> well...we still have Gilda
<pony_9526> Someone we didn't know whether to enjoy or despise
<Stemglass> I can see it as her being a "friendly rival"
<VenHur> Guys, Bad or Good guy, Trixie is STILL awesome!
<AusPony> agreed
<fluttercry> 05,15If it worked for Lyra it works for Colgate
<Sundaysmile> inb4 Discord becomes a good guy...
<pony_3998> THANK YOU BRONY 1337
<DerpyDash> I like the reference to pinkie and the rock farm
<VenHur> Deal with it!
<cachi01> Tovler: wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
<Silver_Spoon> and Flim/Flam
<Brony_1337> Np
<pony_1vs2> trixie is secrelty in love with twillight.. jeez get over it
<pony_4241> ITS CAUSE YR GERMAN
<Pinkies4thWall> GameTaco: the horror!
<CurlyQ> we need a scootsloo ep!
<Grissess> Yeah, I still wanna see a rivalry here
<DocSane2> Aoshima: The term alicorn never appeared in show prior to this, and it was the fandom that adopted it first.
<VenHur> DEAL. WITH. IT.
<xuincherguixe> I thought the Hub was owned by EqDaily?
<AppleLove> Jafar? Ha
<PhonyPony> frenimies sharpen frenimies
<ZeroBlue4> What is a rock farm anyways?
<wowviewer> The way I see it is like she likes to be a show off, but when she put that amulet on her, she didn't know how it corrupted her. I think the whole "redemption" thing could also mean that's the path she didn't intended to get into
<amatobrony> need HD version uploaded
<Grissess> Or maybe an even bigger villain appears
<Babsy> Jafar or Jaclose?
<Stemglass> Frollo was just a creepy pervert
<Silver_Spoon> And me and Diamond Tiara
<Reactor> Jeremy Irons is amazing
<KalarMar> JOJO from PPG is great
<Grissess> then suddenly

<DerpyDash> I like the reference to pinkie and the rock farm
<Grissess> Trixie+Twilight
<rextheponydragon> OK GUESS WHAT PONY I HAVE A CRUSH ON
<BlitzWing00> They should have showed Trixie doubting what she was doing when the amulet made her be mean.
<eastcoastbrony> Ursala was best imo..
<Kammerjunk> Hunchback from Notre Dame is one of the best Disney films I've seen,.
<Kotano> yes,he does
<crazitaco> best villains are indeed Scar and Frollo
<holyblaze0175> like i like the posobility of trix/twi team up
<lunasniperz> times that i find this mystery how did she become evil what happened that she wanted to do this kind of stuff
<FlaschenJoe11> German Scar IS badass
<MadSurge> ^
<GameTaco> Sombra is totally Scar.
<Dazzle> Rarity?
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<aaaaa> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<rextheponydragon> no
<ISky> xuincherguixe: not in the slightest o.O
<N3F4str10> So, this episode of LPS is about robbing pets for your own petshop?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fluttercry, go tell Rina-Chan that
<Jageman> Everypony knows that all rocks have gems in them
<Kotano> also,nazi hyenas
<RedRookieRebel> Go monkey go
<Stemglass> Cruella De Vil best Villain
<aaaaa> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> AJ is best Background pony
<Don-is-Justice> <ZeroBlue4> A farm that supplies the world with endless rocks we don't need. They're paid in gold.
<diddutz> are we talking lion king?
<pony_9526> It's a parallel but the song was more akin to a state of nationalism and militarism
<DerpyDash> I like the reference to pinkie and the rock farm
<Zippoman924> who is Scar?
<xuincherguixe> I was kind of joking.
<Jazmyn> say something in german
<Ponykid> goose stepping
<CrMaReLi> Vexus is best villain
<GameTaco> Whoop.
<fluttercry> 05,15SaxyPretender why does she prefer Minuette?
<rextheponydragon> GUESS AGAIN
<Ponykid> I believe that is called
<SnipsandSnails> Snipsand Snails are hyenas
<BlitzWing00> Rock Farm was a good callback
<crazitaco> seriously, zippoman? you are deprived
<GingerSnap> This discussion needs more poniez
<Aoshima> DocSane2: Sigh...you're never going to drop this, so I'm not going to bother.
<lunasniperz> i bet she's a commie
<Dazzle> Dance like you know you can
<Stemglass> Cruella planned on slaughtering puppies for a furcoat. sorry, that's goddamn evil!
<Ponymon> Gilda and Pinkie confirmed as being friends in later episodes just because you guys don't like Trixe being nice. Cry your tears so I can have a good drink. :)
<Zippoman924> My friends say that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14er, I just know that she's a Colgate fan
<AJIsAwesome> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I thought you meant a Minuette for Colgate
<holyblaze0175> dat sonic
<Jazmyn> ಠ_ಠ
<RealJigga> lps, waht are you doing, lps Stahpp
<SaxyPretender> 0,14liek the musical piece

<fluttercry> 05,15I'm a Colgate fan......she's a Colgate fan....it could work
<Don-is-Justice> Time for LPS.
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<rextheponydragon> HATE?
<ZeroBlue4> So some kind of way of xreating mass from nowhere?
<Tovler> Next time requests are open, maybe I'll post a post an episode (3 minutes long)
<rextheponydragon> I MEAN HAVE
<xuincherguixe> I don't know, I kind of like Kabuto from Naruto. If nothing else than that he abuses the hell out of Zombies.
<Starlight_Phoenix> whats with the laggy stream?
<holyblaze0175> the map one is really good
<CurlyQ> DANIEL INGRAM?!
<CurlyQ> fffffffff

<GameTaco> I'll take GildaPie shipping, sure~
<THEgreenblobofbrony> øh ¥ép
<Jazmyn> waat
<Conyst> They didn't have that poster at the Walmart here.
<rextheponydragon> IM A BOY
<Dovah> rextheponydragon: guess who doesnt care!!
<Kotano> Fillies,dude...
<VenHur> I can see the day, A MLP aniversary movie featuring G1 Ponies in G4 Style.
<Dazzle> new littlest pet shop!
<AppleLove> I wanna do Nurse Redheart
<KalarMar> what i dont understand about trixe is how she could get soooo much bits when she worked on the rock farm FOR A LIVING! i just dont get it
<Stemglass> lol
<cachi01> i know exactly which video im going to request
<SnipsandSnails> MIKE WAZOWSKI
<cachi01> MWAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA
<Dr_Fumbles> Scar is one of my favorite villains. He used trickery, manipulation and words over brute force. Also, his vision for equality was noble, but was wrong and ruined the order of things.
<Zawan> sound
<xuincherguixe> You know what, there's too many great villains for me to say who the best one is.
<RealJigga> jthat would be boss VenHur
<VenHur> That or a G4 Version of the MLP Movie.
<rextheponydragon> dovah i dont care
<Beatfox> The writers did confirm in a panel that it was because of the fans that they adopted the term "alicorn" to replace "pegacorn". It's just that the fandom didn't *invent* that usage of the word alicorn.
<Don-is-Justice> Yes. The entire purpose of Rock Farm? To be useless to the world and kill whatever poor soul works on it.
<tired> where can i watch the lates LPS D:
<GingerSnap> TURN ON Closed Captioning!
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: ?
<VenHur> You know...shoo be doo, shoo shoo be doo?
<DocSane2> I like that Trixie was redeemed. It would have been depressing to think that she'd go on being this twisted, jealous loser.
<GameTaco> I want that burger bed.
<Dazzle> Pudding shoes
<Brony_1337> I wonder what the plot could be if a FiM movie was developed.
<CurlyQ> ..now i want a burger
<Dark_Horst> the jesus, eh?
<Don-is-Justice> Wonder when they'll give us the sound back.
<rextheponydragon> fine i will say who i have a crush on
<lunasniperz> maybe it's like the song from ccr
<Dovah> dont
<DerpyDash> I didnt see Derpy in this episode.....did anybody see her
<Zippoman924> Scootaloo!<3
<rextheponydragon> i have a crush on...
<holyblaze0175> dat acsent is sooo nic
<Jageman> I have to go, later all
<BlitzWing00> They're not going to make that connection because the Big Lewbowski will be so old by then.
<lunasniperz> called proud mary
<rextheponydragon> TWILIGHT
<RealJigga> Celestia dies
<holyblaze0175> late
<Brony_1337> I haven't seen Derpy in Season 3 at all : /
<Reactor> rextheponydragon: Good for you
<SnipsandSnails> Derpy is dead...:'(
<Graywolf71b> if the seaponies return, we need the flutterponies to return also
<CurlyQ> :)
<RealJigga> and everyone is like OHH NOO
<rextheponydragon> lol
<Grissess> RealJigga: SPOILER ALERT!
<Aoshima> Beatfox: Yeah, the term originated in the middle ages to refer to the substance that makes up unicorn horns. However, modern fantasy writers started using it to refer to winged unicorns.
<Elite-sniper-tg-> Every cartoon always gos downhill after a major movie release. so i would'nt want to see a full movie.
<lunasniperz> you don't need to worry cause you have no money people on the river are happy to give
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> RIP Derpy
<wowviewer> I still say that if it's redemtion, I think it's because she didn't want to go to that path (since the amulet corrupted her), but she just wanted to enchance her magic to be better
<CurlyQ> :O <3
<RealJigga> mah bad man, mah bad
<GameTaco> I think Lyra and Berry Punch are going to be the new Derpy.
<ISky> I saw the back of her head in both of the previous episodes
<Conyst> just watched big lewbowski for the first time
<holyblaze0175> Eclipse Celestia
<DerpyDash> Has anyone seen Derpy at all during season 3?
<GameTaco> Especially Lyra.
<pony_6275> :[
<Zippoman924> :P:'(Noooo
<Brony_1337> The 2 part episodes pretty much are movies... let's stick with that
<VenHur> Not me...
<CrMaReLi> Twilight farst. The end. Waaaaaait.... What have I said?
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm, I'm not sure if Flim Flam brothers will come back.
<GingerSnap> :S
<rextheponydragon> when will this episode end i want more my little pony
<BlitzWing00> You know, they can make new "villians"
<Zippoman924> Who else saw Lyra with the soda?
<RealJigga> diamond dogs died
<JRP2234> guys they killed off derpy
<SnipsandSnails> test
<DerpyDash> They need a Derpy Episode
<Grissess> This.
<Beatfox> Aoshima: correct
<pony_1vs2> who is sombra? never noticed him...
<Stemglass> need to be dropped off a cliff
<Ponymon> Sombra's not returning. This is confirmed.
<RealJigga> Sombra was the unicorn king
<AJIsAwesome> I'd actually like Gilda and the Diamond Dogs come back.
<lunasniperz> herd the new skyfall song it's surperb
<AusPony> gilda wont come back
<Silver_Spoon> Diamond Tiara for Archvillan of the series :3
<Graywolf71b> Derpy better show up:[
<joshman129> what about discord?
<Brony_1337> I will find the Soccer Mom who complained about Derpy.
<GameTaco> Nightmare Moon became bad again. You need to pay lots of gems to re-redeem her.
<Conyst> we saw them again
<GingerSnap> Fus Roh DERP! :P
<rextheponydragon> sombra is a evil pony born in smoke
<Beatfox> Aoshima: That's why I specified that particular usage of alicorn
<JRP2234> guys they killed off derpy shes gone
<Grissess> Gilda only ever appeared once
<cachi01> gilda? yes
<rextheponydragon> i think
<wowviewer> Twilight casted the parasprite spell lol
<pony_1vs2> sounds intense lol
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: You forgot Iron Will and Flin Flan Brothers.
<THEgreenblobofbrony> :P
<RealJigga> I saw that wowviewer
<Pale_Horse> What confuses me is that some people consider Iron Will a vilalin, when he wasn't villanous at all. he was just aggressive and wanted pay for his services. :P
<cachi01> diamond dogs? i really dont care about them
<BlitzWing00> "Villians"? More like "Jerks".
<JRP2234> hasbro killed derpy :<
<Don-is-Justice> Down to at least 178. I might just vanish too if no sound.
<CrystalPhoenix> Diamond Tiara is best villain
<Stemglass> Iron Will wasn't really a "villain"
<GameTaco> I just want a reason to bring back Iron Will. :3
<RealJigga> Iron Will is best pony
<AJIsAwesome> Flim and Flam are more of antagonists to me.
<CrMaReLi> no flim and flam. Just no
<Zippoman924> Discord, Who else thought of daddy Discord
<brony_655321> Discord is not confirmed. Just John de Lancie.
<Grissess> Yeah, there's a villain spectrum of apparent "jerks" to "villains"
<Conyst> Flim and Flam not Flin and Flan
<GingerSnap> I don't really care about flim and flam actually. They were great 1 hit charachters.
<pony_1vs2> derpy is gone.. sadly
<rextheponydragon> iron will: YEEEAAAH!
<BlitzWing00> He wasn't antigonizing
<wowviewer> Flim and Flam a villain? They're more like business rival. So they aren't villains lol
<xuincherguixe> Iron Will is the best pony.
<pony_boat> He's a businessman with bad advice
<AppleLove> That was a horrible impression
<SnipsandSnails> Derpy...you will be missed...:'(
<DerpyDash> SOME PON TRIES TO BLOCK.......SHOW THEM YOU ROCK
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but fluttercry, what will Chie think?!
<AusPony> tony robbins is a villian
<Grissess> BILLY MAYS HERE WITH A BOOT TO THE HEAD
<Atherius> :D
<rextheponydragon> ok i will critizise
<wowviewer> It's like saying Microsoft's villain is Apple :P
<Brony_1337> lol
<RainbowDerpy> LOL
<pony_456> cant wait till ponies!!!!!!!!!
<rextheponydragon> FUCK BUCK FUCK BUCK
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wow, that surprisingly fit the character in the show XD
<Kencolt> That is a VERY VERY disturbing image.
<rjimenez> its Mr. Satan/Hercule
<Tovler> (heh, that Barbie episode where dolphins got into the plumbing of her malibu mansion. I'm so easily amused)
<Graywolf71b> O_o
<AppleLove> pony 456, your a little late
<DerpyDash> He did say I pitty the fool
<Stemglass> I like how you said Hulk Hogan ^^
<CECtheRonin> Did Derpy die? D:
<Kammerjunk> When somepony tries to block, show them your co- no
<DocSane2> Has someone official said that Derpy is now gone?
<GameTaco> Iron Will, presenting INSANITY
<Pale_Horse> I'd say more Macho Man Randy Savage than Hulk hogan. :P
<cachi01> barbie......
<cachi01> wut
<pony_456> am i??
<Ralathon> Manotaur!
<RealJigga> Euro movie night?
<pony_8336> when show start?
<RealJigga> wut
<GingerSnap> NO! I'M trying to watch LPS!
<Conyst> Seen all the episodes so far.
<Silver_Spoon> X-Minotaur
<Grissess> Derpy went the way of Cupcakes.
<Silver_Spoon> X-Men
<Marx> Wait a minute. I just thought of something.
<fluttercry> 05,15Hey Chie never found out about Rise...or Naoto....or Yukiko. SO I see no problem here
<J_E_Smith71> DocSane2: We haven't seen in the front
<pony_456> im sad now
<RealJigga> LOL
<Conyst> Manotaur
<Sumica> 00,10ex-manotaur
<Marx> What was the lesson in today's episode?
<Silver_Spoon> oh...exminotaur
<rextheponydragon> if twilight gets a crush in mlp i will die
<Aoshima> Beatfox: I just hate it when the fans claim that they came up with the term on their own. It's ignorant and stupid.
<pony_1vs2> a manotaur.. thats manly
<J_E_Smith71> DocSane2: We've seen her in the back twice
<BlitzWing00> Iron Will is just teaching assertiveness which is a little too excessive.
<Beatfox> DocSane2: I think people are saying that because they haven't seen her in the most recent episodes.
<Don-is-Justice> Damn it, I'm gone.
<wowviewer> Thinking back again, not sure if Gilda's a villain either. A bully yes, but not a villain I think
<pony_8336> ehh
<Ralathon> The manotaurs have fists for nipples!
<cachi01> Kammerjunk: controller? corpse? cone?
<Grissess> MANOTAUR
<LyraHeartstrings> gravity falls is EPIC!!!!! :D
<Tovler> and when Raquelle started hitting on a He-man. ahhh good stuff
<CrMaReLi> Iron is NLP master
<Reactor> I have never heard anything about Gravity Falls
<Zippoman924> youtube maybe
<Conyst> on the internet
<xuincherguixe> There aren't many villains in MLP.
<DocSane2> J_E_Smith71: So... SShe's back to being a background character.
<Tovler> k, i'm done
<pony_8336> when the show starts for mlp?
<pony_5151> DocSane2: before the season, someone on the show said Derpy'd be silent but "everywhere", but that's not happening
<GingerSnap> Marx: Don't mess with Alicorns. They are the highest level unicorn
<cachi01> wut
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I don't have the ability to watch Gravity Falls ;__________________;
<rextheponydragon> how long is this episode!!!!!!?
<SnipsandSnails> WHEN WILL THE NEXT GRAVITY FALLS EPISODE COMEOUT? SERIOUSLY!
<Pale_Horse> I wanna see a fight between Iron Will and Tirek
<DerpyDash> IronWill does say "I Pity the Fool"
<JT> I've watched a few episodes of Gravity Falls.
<Brony_1337> Hasbro is trying to rid of Derpy Hooves merchandise o_o
<J_E_Smith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: That's also next week's ep on BMN!
<Beatfox> Aoshima: Yeah, misinformation abounds in ridiculously huge fandoms. Not much you can do about it.
<brony_655321> Gravity Falls is online...
<Dark_Horst> these seem to be the mentioned manotaurs http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120816032427/gravityfalls/images/c/cb/S1e6_manotaurs.png
<xuincherguixe> Diamond Tiara probably counts oddly enough. She's a bit of a proto villain.
<wowviewer> King Sombra, Queen Chrysalis, and Discord are definetly are villains
<baud> Hey everyone, came here from BronyTV...their stream is having some buffering issues.
<pony_6275> gravity falls is amazing
<Reactor> Disney? I thought it was CN
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: Are you up for some Q&As?
<holyblaze0175> alright I have to go Later Ponies ;)
<BlitzWing00> wowviewer : Gilda was not a bully, she was a jerk. She didn't follow Pinkie around and picked on her.
<GameTaco> So will Iron Will challenge the CMC to kill a multibear, or...
<pony_8336> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz seriously nobody asking my question..........
<Pinkies4thWall> bye holyblaze0175
<RealJigga> I hate lps' animation
<brony_655321> It is online...
<baud> Weird question: Are the hosts going to keep talking when the show is on?
<rextheponydragon> manny:HOW BIG IS THIS OCEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Stemglass> Derpy Hooves makes money. Hasbro likes money
<xuincherguixe> Introduce her to a hedge fund and she'll blossom into a full blown demon.
<lunasniperz> we need more james bond referances as well
<Conyst> Grunkle Stan
<Grissess> Oh, that show.
<Grissess> Meh.
<Stemglass> No Derpy = less Money
<SailorPegasus> Phineas and ferb was shot down by CN too
<Dark_Horst> i found manotaurs http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120816032427/gravityfalls/images/c/cb/S1e6_manotaurs.png
<Aoshima> Gravity Falls has a lot of writers that originally worked for Cartoon Network.
<lunasniperz> at least a goldfinger pony
<wowviewer> BlitzWing00: Well guess that's true. Still not a villain though lol
<J_E_Smith71> DocSane2: Derpy was in the first two episodes, but her face hasn't been seen
<Tobiwan> where are you from germany
<Stemglass> They are Keeping Derpy around
<LyraHeartstrings> my favorite character is Mabel :)
<DerpyDash> Who would win....... Sombra or IronWill
<Tovler> Trixie on LPS?
<holyblaze0175> thx
<AlienWarhead> baud they do not talk during a new episode
<Braviary> http://youtu.be/KprpJmgvpww They have a parody up already of this episode.
<xuincherguixe> Iron Will.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14DID SOMEONE SAY LOST?!
<DerpyDash> WHERE DID DERPY GO?!
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, but Sombra conquered an empire. Iron Will just sells advice.
<Conyst> What is your quest?
<pony_6275> iron will is Hercule as a minotaur
<J_E_Smith71> alicupcake1235: It's over
<RealJigga> Roids Pony or Fluttershy
<MLW> in terms of using everything
<Stemglass> Do you actualy live in Germany? and if so, where?
<Sundaysmile> If Sombra tries to block slap him with your ****
*Jmo slaps SaxyPretender around a bit with a large trout
<Tobiwan> where are you from germany?
<Dark_Horst> pony_2343: loooogn over buddy
<alicupcake1235> awwwwwww
<Atherius> oh jesus
<Gilda> Here's a question for you: At the end of the episode did Twilight actually prove she can break the fourth wall as well?
<Ponymon> I'm pretty sure Sombra was confirmed as being dead and not returning by the show's creators.
<RealJigga> Roids Pony vs Fluttershy :P
<Kammerjunk> cachi01: Yes.
<Brony_1337> The episodes right here if you missed it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro4qKF3x7V0
<Kammerjunk> All of those.
<lunasniperz> or a oddjob referance
<GameTaco> He'll hand Sombra a C4 explosive disguised as a handheld gaming device.
<Grissess> Derpy appeared in the background for this episode
<Jmo> BUSTAH WOOOOOOLF
<Aoshima> Iron Will and Sombra wouldn't actually get around to fighting: they'd just keep growling at eachother forever.
<cachi01> seriously hasbro......stahp trying to create another fandom

<Pinkies4thWall> If i watch for derpy, I miss the episode
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Tobiwan, no video links during stream
<GingerSnap> Did anyone see the HORESES in this episode? XD
<pony_1vs2> I only believe it was derpy as soon as i see the eyes
<twilight_sprinkle> i think i mightve seen derpy run by at some point
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: I can understand the VA bit, but what's wrong with working on a different show?
<Cheesefox> Saddle Arabia
<RealJigga> Cloudcahser is best pony also.
<lunasniperz> i know i am geting anoying and i am sorry right now i am working on about 3 hours of sleep
<twilight_sprinkle> but not sure
<xuincherguixe> I think Celestia is the only Horse.
<Sundaysmile> again she was in the crowd watching twilight do magic at the end
<Kinixys> Did the horses have cutie marks?
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind Ingram making the music for this show.
<Jet> You say that Derpy appeared in the 1st Crystal Kingdom episode in corner. How can you be sure that was her without seeing her eyes or cutie mark?
<Zippoman924> Who is best CMC pony?
<GameTaco> Stupid horse.
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: nothing but they really try to emulate mlp
<Conyst> Cloudkicker
<Cheesefox> Cloud Kicker

<pony_3520> Cloud.....
<Tovler> I like how M.A. Larson is willing to go by Mitch in the credits for LPS
<Grissess> What's a kid's show without terrible puns?
<Beatfox> the more terrible the puns, the better
<AJIsAwesome> Hey, I liked Las Pegasus.
<Stemglass> Hey. Las Pegasus representing, here!
<texasboykc09> bowling?
<Ralathon> ALL NAMES MUST BE HORSE PUNS!
<brony_655321> I remember that comic.
<pony_4241> Cloudsdale is pretty clever
<Ponymon> The saddle Arabia horses? Those horses? Yeah, I saw them. I understand people are crying because they exist, not sure why.
<Zippoman924> i saw that before
<Cyberlord> las pegas
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/?i=6113
<Generic> fun on a pun
<AlienWarhead> Dodge Junction is the only non pun town
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/?i=6113
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: Question for you Scoots, Are you willing to see more of the two realistic looking horses at the end of "Magic Duel"?
<NASCARFAN160_2> My Little Punny
<Conyst> What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
<wowviewer> Seeing that some episodes are yet to be revealed, what other episode you would like to see?
<GameTaco> Not enough puns. Imagine 4Kids handling MLP.
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/?i=6113
<cachi01> Saddle arabie
<Kammerjunk> There was no point in looking back. Buck no, not today, thank you kindly.
<xuincherguixe> Saw that on derpibooru a few days ago.
<cachi01> arabia*
<cachi01> lel
<BlitzWing00> That comic was funny
<Stemglass> Can you say Flootershy?
<lunasniperz> yea
<RealJigga> @GameTaco no. just no.
<GameTaco> There'd be puns within puns.
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: ?
<Tobiwan> WHERE IS THE GIRL FROM IN GERMANY?
<Conyst> no no 4kids
<Generic> Fun on a Pun!
<CrystalPhoenix> You gotta love Tabitha for that
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
<DerpyDash> Who is your overall favorite Villian?
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<australian> this episode was great
<Kammerjunk> Except the "Buck" part.
<CrystalPhoenix> Tabitha is best VA
<Vordox> <--- SPOILERS
<lunasniperz> i am being taought by the best in my area that's erine shelgel
<SnipsandSnails> What if Derpy doesn't get any more appearences?....
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> dat spoiler
<xuincherguixe> Pinkie clones and a Dash Recolour?
<GameTaco> Best VA for best pony.
<Grissess> Can we get post-episode spoilers now?
<AJIsAwesome> I thought the filly AJ and Rarity would be an episode in itself based on the promo.
<Conyst> your Vordox may contain spoilers.
<xuincherguixe> That's it. MLP is now Final Fantasy.
<lunasniperz> times that i owe him 30 dollars for a ball i bought
<Silver_Spoon> Derp-gate
<texasboykc09> australian: it was
<AppleLove> I loved Babs voice....
<Brony_1337> Hasbro is just scared they will get flamed for putting Derpy back in..
<Zippoman924> What Babs is epic!
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: naaaah :D
<RealJigga> i like babs' voic.
<AppleLove> Its manhattan...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>hating on Babs' voice
<RealJigga> voice*
<J_E_Smith71> SnipsandSnails: At least front apperances, so far we just see from the back
<SaxyPretender> 0,14GET OUT
<DocSane2> SnipsandSnails: We content ourselves with all her past appearances?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it was the DA BESSS
<Stemglass> People thought her NY accent was a little too thick
<Atherius> babs voice is fitting
<Brony_1337> Babs has a Bronx accent
<Graywolf71b> They'll get flamed if they leave her out
<wowviewer> I didn't mind Bab Seed's voice
<VenHur> I like Babs' voice.
<Jmo> Unlike you Saxy
<Jmo> :3
<cachi01> AJIsAwesome: they just edit it and make it look like a different episode
<J_E_Smith71> Remember Derpy's still in full force in the comic guys
<Jet> Because Babs was supposed to be a girl and people complained that it was too deep for a little filly.
<AusPony> ye it was a little B grade
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: I love that Sweetie Belle was so thrilled to impersonate Rarity :D
<Ponykid> I did not hate her voice
<Kammerjunk> Hell, I thought the horses from Saddle Arabia would have an episode based around them.
<DerpyDash> Who is your overall favorite Villian?
<Stemglass> I liked Babs' voice. a lot ^^
<AppleLove> THERE ARE MORE PLACES IN EQUESTRIA, THEY ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
<VenHur> SaxyPretender: BEES! NOT THE BEEEESS!! AUUUUUGH!! MY EYEEEEES!!!
<Babsy> I like Babs' voice it's wonderful
<AJIsAwesome> Not really. That was ripped straight from the episode.
<Ninjazz> Am I the only one that doesn't like Bab's voice?
<BlitzWing00> It's that Everfree Episode review where the reviewer trashed on the episode the whole review.
<Brony_1337> Babs voice was perfect
<SnipsandSnails> Babs seed voice was epic
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind her voice.
<Brony_1337> I loved the song!!
<brony_655321> What is your favorite D'aw moment?
<GameTaco> Blythe got a Golden Ticket?
<shutupscoots> babs had a boston accent
<cachi01> i dont mind babs at all
<Silver_Spoon> She be a brooklinite
<shutupscoots> closer to brooklyn
<VenHur> I loved the song.
<wowviewer> lol
<Generic> i keep getting distracted by the dancing pony in the corrner
<Stemglass> I have a buddy from Long Island and he talks with the same kind of accent.
<MadSurge> cachi01: manipulative editing, I LOVE IT >8D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm from NYC and I love that voice!
<CriticKitten> He's from Brooklyn. BROOKLYN RAAAAAAGE.
<diddutz> I can't even remember her voice ... schame on me.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Scoot-Scootaloo look http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/336/4/8/the_magic_by_theflashguy-d5mtapj.jpg
<cachi01> lol
<Grissess> shutupscoots: Couldn't have said that nick better myself.
<Ponykid> interesting
<AJIsAwesome> It's her voice, it makes her unique.
<J_E_Smith71> ...although the comic can't call her by name, and that just called Derpy "That pony"
<Brony_1337> It has a nice 90's cartoonish theme
<MadSurge> ^
<SnipsandSnails> Sweetie Belle drinking milkshake is best DAWWWW moment
<pony_63391> My little Saddle Arabia - Oil is Magic
<Zippoman924> My GF's name is Brooklynn
<Conyst> I only complain about Bon-Bon's voice.
<Jet> But it is nearly impossible not to sound like you have a deep voice when you're from New York.
<AJIsAwesome> If she had a different voice, it could be branded as generic and boring.
<Pale_Horse> The Saddle Arabian ponies had an awesome design. :)
<shutupscoots> babs sounded like john travlta ass a filly
<Ninjazz> Would it?
<DerpyDash> Who is your overall favorite Villian?
<lunasniperz> wait champanige at this age
<richfiles> I HOPE for more Saddle Arabian horse ponies! :)
<MadSurge> Besides it's not like there aren't kids that sound exactly like that
<Brony_1337> Babs had a Bronx accent
<brony_655321> Favorite Daw moment?
<Conyst> does she have Brooklynn Rage?
<Tovler> eh, that brooklyn accent was pretty bad
<Zippoman924> What is your view on RWBY?
<GameTaco> Wine for lunch? Sure why not.
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: Do you had any ideas for episodes if you becomed a producer/writer/artist for the show?
<Tobiwan> I think the ponies will travel to saddle arabia
<Panda> DerpyDash: Twilight Sparkle is best villian.
<Ninjazz> Yes.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Jet, you've never heard me speak XD
<Grissess> Saddle Arabia
<Grissess> inb4 canon
<dinomaster627> bye evrey pony
<AJIsAwesome> Eh, not to me.
<Stemglass> I scoot!
<GameTaco> So wait.
<Tovler> I would have gone with chicago accent
<alexxm> hey guys
<Kammerjunk> Only Equestria has magic?
<xuincherguixe> Arabians are a horse breed as well. So does that make this a double horse name? Is that allowed?
<Jet> I have to ask: why was it necessary to use live animals for that performance...?
<Brony_1337> What is camels are in Saddle Arabia??
<MadSurge> Tovler: I guess, but at least it was identifiable
<Beatfox> Zecora has drink refill magic. That's awesome.
<AJIsAwesome> It was a little cringe-worthy at first, but it took some getting used to.
<Brony_1337> *if
<GameTaco> Does this mean this would be the second horse/pony society that probably has no pegasi or unicorns at all?
<Pale_Horse> By the way. The Saddle Arabia trip explained why Celestia was too busy to stop trixie, but what the buck about Luna? :|
<xuincherguixe> Is Celestia going to have to choke someone?
<BlitzWing00> Donkey's and Mules don't have cutie marks
<pony_9971> Perry, what's your deviantart?
<J_E_Smith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: Can you guys do a quick review of the first issue of the comic while you're at it, or is it too soon to spoil since it's only been in stores for a few days?
<cachi01> Kammerjunk: iirc equestria is the world were they live
<Pinkies4thWall> Scoot-Scootaloo: question for all of you. You are stuck on a desert island with one pony. Choose between Twist and Silver Spoon.
<Yahooz> okay guys, thats enough hanging around here ^_^
<Tovler> "How'd that pit o viper get there? You should be more careful"
<pony_4919> it's exclusive to the heartland
<Generic> stuffs getting real! hit another bowl
<SnipsandSnails> Zecora is not a pony giving her a cutie mark is like giving Cranky a cutie mark
<Conyst> Drink refill is best magic
<Ponykid> luna was probably asleep
<cachi01> Kammerjunk: that or the continent
<BroHoof> hi everyone!
<DerpyDash> Which Trixie appearence did you like better....... Her first or this one
<Yahooz> please go back to the mane chat
<Kammerjunk> cachi01: "...in the magical land of Equestria..."
<lunasniperz> damn you joseph satlin techneachs to kill off derpy
<Grissess> What was Zecora drinking anyways?
<brony_655321> Celestia pun comic: http://horsepower.emeraldcoastcomics.net/4
<lunasniperz> i will find you and kill you
<GameTaco> Please.
<bronypoet> where are the sea ponies?
<GameTaco> Robin Williams as... Anypony.
<Atherius> is cheesus real?
<shutupscoots> robin williams is best pony
<diaehmes> candy
<Tovler> or maybe a blaccent… nah, the comments on that would've hurt my soul
<Scoot-Scootaloo> http://i.imagebanana.com/img/kb6opkof/qyr2z.png
<SnipsandSnails> Twidog is best dog
<VenHur> I like both of them, but the second one is better since it had a HUGE character development for Trixie.
<Azuredragon> Stan Lee comeo pls
<lunasniperz> if discord comes back what he needs is a walther
<mishia> did i miss the episode
<Azuredragon> Cameo*
<xuincherguixe> Wait. Who would win in a street fight between Robin Williams Pony and Pinkie Pie?
<mishia> did
<DinkyDoo> Hi everypony
<mishia> I?
<DerpyDash> Which Trixie appearence did you like better....... Her first or this one
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 OMFG LISTEN
<Pale_Horse> I dislike the "Oh, Luna sleeps during the day" explanation. We've seen Celestia up and aware during night scenes. She dosen't seem affected adversely when she has to do that.
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 LISTEN
<Pinkies4thWall> Lol scoots
<Ponykid> PINKIE PIE ALL THE WAY
<SnipsandSnails> this one
<Graywolf71b> The first Trixie
<CriticKitten> Her first.
<CriticKitten> By far.
<Brony_1337> Saddle Arabia is a play on Saudi Arabia
<RealJigga> >Pinkie nope.avi
<aniderp> what are your favorite ponies/side ponies?
<AJIsAwesome> I haven't been on dA since the first coupld of episodes of S3.
<AJIsAwesome> Too many spoilers.
<Ponykid> or she could have been elsewhere
<Pinkies4thWall> ALL THE PUNS!
<CrystalPhoenix> How the episode should have been http://fav.me/d5mt1pw
<CriticKitten> The second is just ruined by the ending. >_>
<Pinkies4thWall> LOOOOL
<Jet> I think it was Scoot-Scootaloo that said Derpy appeared in the Crystal KIngdom in the jousting scene. However, you can't see her eyes nor her cutie mark. How can you be sure that this was her?
<pony_9971> Ugh
<RealJigga> wait
<CriticKitten> That joke is old, Scoot.
<CriticKitten> :P
<Silver_Spoon> BOOOOOOO
<DerpyDash> Which Trixie appearence did you like better....... Her first or this one
<RealJigga> wat happened at the end O_o
<GameTaco> Dem eyes.
<wowviewer> Booooooooooo
<xuincherguixe> No. That pun was horsed.
<Graywolf71b> >___>
<Grissess> Scoot-Scootaloo: Get out.
<australian> puns -_-
<Zippoman924> Can she please say Flootershy that will make my day
<Pinkies4thWall> Scoot-Scootaloo: I need to mail you a blind bag for that pun
<Pale_Horse> Derpy: "Chaaaaaage!" :P
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: XD
<shutupscoots> neighvada?
<Kammerjunk> I haven't been on EQD since S3 was getting close.
<AusPony> terrible
<CriticKitten> Scoot, stop horsing around.
<AJIsAwesome> Scoots, please stop.
<Ditzy_Doo> Pony with green hair: RARARARARAH!
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: Do you had an idea for a pony or a villain? Or did you made either yourself?
<brony_655321> Favorit Daw moment?
<xuincherguixe> These are really shoe horned in.
<GameTaco> You made her cry~
<AJIsAwesome> I still go to EQD.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> stop horsing around Scoot-Scootaloo
<Zippoman924> yes!
<DocSane2> DerpyDash: Second. Got more characterization this time.
<Silver_Spoon> Stable the puns for Luna's sake
<Azuredragon> Scoot Scootaloo became Chuggaconroy
<CriticKitten> I can hardly mare any more of your bad puns.
<shutupscoots> Futashy
<AJIsAwesome> I just avoid all the spoiler posts.
<GameTaco> I think Sweetie Belle has been outdone.
*Pinkies4thWall says FLOOTAHSHAI

<RealJigga> whoa
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo's sprite killed the stream XD
<Cheesefox> O deer
<GameTaco> Thing is, this seems to be a strange episode. The humans and the pets are being kept completely separate, unless they have the two plotlines converge at the very end.
<Beatfox> r.i.p.

<Dr_Fumbles> So why did the stream die earlier?
<cachi01> and u win points
<Starlight_Phoenix> is the term alicorn now official?
<Grissess> There is no stream though '-'

<Grissess> Post video links like no tomorrow.
<Dr_Fumbles> Kinixys: OH
<aniderp> and again
<Brony_1337> I have the Babs Seed song stuck in my head
<pony_2211> great, we got Peppersprites in the stream lines again
<Ponymon> So, now that we can't hear those guys, I'd just like to say that I'm glad Twilight and Trixie are friends now. Yes, this is a troll post, but it's also my personal feelings on the ending of today's episode.
<Vordox> Sumica: Warning you, Desjtop Ponies are java, it's heavy memory, and makes the stream becomming secondary prio on memory. ><
<Beatfox> Brony_1337: Pretty sure there isn't a brony on the planet who doesn't still have that song stuck in their head.
<aniderp> nothing...
<brony_655321> Well, technically they still aren't.
<GligarMan> WE NEED MOAR TRIXIE EPISODES
<SnipsandSnails> Me too Brony_1337, me too
<aniderp> i hear nothing :\
<CountDoofus> I don't.
<GameTaco> I think it's a fair ending.
<CriticKitten> I hate it.
<aniderp> paused on the unicorn
<GligarMan> THAT ACTUALLY EXPAND ON THIS ENDING
<J_E_Smith71> If you want to hear them, go here: http://ponify.me/player.html
<Kammerjunk> Oh, she's making it so much h- I'm just going to shut up
<TheMoon17> theres nothing on mine
<diddutz> my stream is back but still laggy
<GameTaco> Now they can offload some of Rainbow's ego onto Trixie...
<Vordox> Nope
<CriticKitten> But maybe that's because I'm bitter, or maybe it's because I see in this ending a growing trend that I dislike
<Pinkies4thWall> Beatfox: inorite. It's been driving me nuts
<Vordox> You are NOT back, stream died again XD
<texasboykc09> lost stream
<ImaDolphin> Im going to Play Gmod

<Sumica> 00,10was masive frame drops
<xuincherguixe> I did a guest comic for friendship is dragons. It was kind of hard and I didn't even need to actually draw anything.
<Grissess> I love how all these ads are trying to convince me that I'm missing a codec or plugin so I can download bloatware/spyware/adware/malware
<texasboykc09> Sumica: that why there was that lag
<Sumica> 00,10cause stream was brodcasting to dead end
<DocSane2> Anyway, 'twas fun. I'm out.
<Silver_Spoon> http://fav.me/d5mt1pw
<AlienWarhead> Grissess: get adblocker
<Pinkies4thWall> toxic-mario: What is your favorite comic you've made?
<Silver_Spoon> thats my last one for now >_>
<AJIsAwesome> aniderp: Fav? Applejack. Fav side? Don't have one.
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: What's your idea for a official My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic console game?
<Grissess> AlienWarhead: Public computer, property of my work
<Grissess> otherwise, I would
<aniderp> im asking the people who talking.. xD
<GameTaco> :(
<Brony_1337> I want a game like Animal Crossing, it'd be a perfect idea for a MLP:FiM game
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I got your questions, no worries~
<aniderp> ok
<Jmo> I question if you'll ever be MLG Scoot :P
<aniderp> sorry i repeated it D:
<Graywolf71b> LUNA!
<Zippoman924> Luna!
<RainbowDerpy> Luna's finally up
<brony_655321> Also, who is that green desktop pony?
<GameTaco> Luna, don't land on that flower.
<J_E_Smith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: Did you answer mine while the stream was down?
<AJIsAwesome> brony_655321: Scoot-Scootaloo's OC.
<Pinkies4thWall> Scoots is best MLG pony
<brony_655321> oh.
<AJIsAwesome> ohai, NewDCD.
<VenHur> Oh hi NewDCD.
<xuincherguixe> It must be night now.
<RainbowDerpy> Dammit luna
<Jmo> Ooo so scary Scoot :P
<Tovler> eeesh. so I guess that Tabitha st germaine actually singing… is LPS still streaming?
<Pinkies4thWall> NewDCD! hai!
<GameTaco> Blythe, don't remove your Alicon Amulet...
<OneTrickPony> hiya NewDCD
<J_E_Smith71> brony_655321: That's the streamer's OC
<Zippoman924> Wait Scootaloo episode! Nice
<Ponymon> Just wait. Gilda will return to become friends with RD and everyone, the Flim Flam Bros. will turn into honest business men, and Diamond Tiara & Silver Spoon will turn over a new leaf and be nice to the CMC. The series will end, the fans will rage, and the fandom will melt under the rage-fuelled heat of it all. I eagerly await all of your tears, for they are good eatings, mmm! :)
<cachi01> yay
<xuincherguixe> That is a pretty well done sprite.
<Silver_Spoon> Eh, Sweetie Belle
<Graywolf71b> I wish I had a plushie of Luna sleeping like that
<brony_655321> Well I figured that from the current interview.
<Kammerjunk> I'm more of a Chrysalis fan than Discord.
<GameTaco> Wow, she has a lot of inventory space.
<pony_4908> Rarity's supposed to have a duet with Octavia, right? :P
<J_E_Smith71> Okay
<Pinkies4thWall> Scoot-Scootaloo: silly, that's Apple Bloom you're talking about.
<toxic-mario> yes
<AlienWarhead> I love the comic got it yesterday
<SaxyPretender|Breakf> 0,14I still need to go Midtown Comics for the Derpy variant
<Sumica> 00,10aye Vordox did a good job spriteing her
<Scoot-Scootaloo> http://imageshack.us/a/img715/4244/afalling.gif <-- My OC
<J_E_Smith71> Never mind, so she doesn't get spoiled
<Vertizontal> I didnt really dig the art in the comic
<Kammerjunk> Maybe it's because I never watched Star Trek.
<aniderp> do you lot like the legend of zelda games?
<Vordox> Someone poked me name?
<GameTaco> I was hoping he'd shake her clothes off too, and then it turns out she's wearing her normal clothes under it all.
<Brony_1337> I do
<Ninjazz> I liked all the villains equally.
<cachi01> i've never watched star trek
<DaringDerpy> can't see it
<cachi01> and i like discord more than chrysalis
<Scoot-Scootaloo> http://imageshack.us/a/img715/4244/afalling.gif
<Vordox> It's NOT a recolour
<cachi01> but damn she is hot
<DaringDerpy> oh...nice :)
<Pinkies4thWall> Nice, Scoots

<GameTaco> Pie face.
<GligarMan> Wait, whats Meep?
<pony_4908> They sold so much G*K, the entire company staff was able to retire. THAT'S why we're not seeing it anymore. :D
<AJIsAwesome> You know, if they didn't give Meep the attention in the call, the chance of it ever being a forced meme will rise.
<Silver_Spoon> So we can't talk about the sticky stuff?
<Pinkies4thWall> Thanks for being with us, Toxic!
<Brony_1337> Wow
<GameTaco> Myyyyy little ponyyyyy.
<AJIsAwesome> *won't rise as much

<crazitaco> LPS shop is so awesome
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome, is that what it is?
<Kammerjunk> Poniator works quickly.
<pony_1928> did I miss MLP or does it air later?
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Poniator's been working on it ever since the episode leak.
<xuincherguixe> This makes all the sense in the world.
<Ninjazz> Poniator cheated!
<Jmo> You missed it.
<GameTaco> It's a TV show!
<xuincherguixe> You missed it.

<rextheponydragon> hello again peeps

<AJIsAwesome> Yeah.
<GameTaco> I want that hat.
<pony_3996> ah i remember when i threw rocks at cars when i was a kid
<Babsy> Why are they heating pizza over a fire
<Pinkies4thWall> Not a superman thing or what

<ponytime> so how did the episode turn out
<ponytime> tech trouble?
<ponytime> GNAA?
<pony_3996> Aquabats= other cartoons. Power man= pony?
<GameTaco> Possibly.
<cachi01> or you know....
<rextheponydragon> is this a movie or a add
<cachi01> jailbreak
<DaringDerpy> ponytime: awesome
<cachi01> IAPcracker...
<GameTaco> Rock rock on!
<Moopy> Yo whats up everypony
<BladedWings> hi Moopy
<VenHur> Moopy: You missed it.
<Babsy> rextheponydragon: It's a show apparently
<J_E_Smith71> brony_655321: Although commonly quoted as "meep meep", Warner Brothers, the current owner of all trademarks relating to the duo, lists "beep, beep" as the Road Runner's sound, along with "meep, meep."
<OneTrickPony> hai Moopy
<Moopy> i did
<GameTaco> xD
<rextheponydragon> thanks babsy
<Kammerjunk> I played it for a week or so and got bored when I hit 37.
<VenHur> Moopy: Yeah...
<DaringDerpy> hi Moopy
<Moopy> Fuck
<Pinkies4thWall> What's up Moopy
<AlienWarhead> ponytime no just server issues, it might have been under mantenance
<Moopy> hey dude
<brony_655321> Ah, so it's a dual thing.
<Kammerjunk> And when I say a week, I mean a week. I was late to the party, so I played that thing all the time.
<Brony_1337> Am I allowed to post a YouTube link to the new episode?
<Ponymon> So, honest opinion time. Is this music any good?
<Babsy> rextheponydragon: no problem
<Dante22> it's Showtime!!!!!!!!!!!
<cachi01> when you activate all harmony stones nightmare moon says HA they wont work unless you have all spirits of harmony
<rextheponydragon> lol
<cachi01> so yeah
<Pinkies4thWall> Brony_1337: do it in PM
<Brony_1337> Ok
<AlienWarhead> Brony_1337: you shouldn't
<cachi01> you have to buy rarity,rd,pinkie,fluttershy and AJ
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Brony_1337: Nope
<rextheponydragon> * walks in on them singing and kills them *
<Brony_1337> I was only wondering, sorry
<cachi01> that would be 700$ please
<DaringDerpy> Brony_1337: is it on eqd already?
<GameTaco> BFF!
<pony_3996> good idea it is not. Dark side of the horse you will be walking
<AlienWarhead> no problem Brony_1337
<GameTaco> ...
<Brony_1337> Not sure, but it is on YouTube, i know
<rextheponydragon> a robot...
<Kammerjunk> I never even got Dashie.
<Ponymon> It's a transformer!
<Pinkies4thWall> It's a Megazord!
<sugarponi872> did you know the people who made homestar runner worked on this show?
<GameTaco> As if it weren't enough like the Power Rangers.
<rextheponydragon> oh god
<rextheponydragon> that failed
<J_E_Smith71> brony_655321: "Even though the expression was spelled 'beep beep' on the screen, and that the word 'beep' was used in many subsequent Road Runner cartoon titles, Paul Julian insisted that the correct spelling was 'H-M-E-E-P"; 'hmeep hmeep', rather than 'beep beep
<AJIsAwesome> There are way too many parasprites for me.
<brony_655321> Almost on youtube. EQD has a progress posting.
<rextheponydragon> Trololol
<J_E_Smith71> brony_655321: But obviously after dozens of Road Runner cartoons, and other appearances of the Road Runner and Coyote in other media, with the word 'beep' attached, it's much too late to make any change in that spelling."
<VenHur> Lol
<Moopy> Oh well i guess i have to look it up on youtube and watched the missed the episode that i missed SHIT oh well
<aniderp> coco pebbles
<AJIsAwesome> The shops I have give little to no gems of the ones i need.
<pony_3996> should be able to find the ep uploaded via searching with the date added filter so really no point in linkin it anyhow
<Pinkies4thWall> HUBOOM!
<AlienWarhead> IT OVER 8000!!!!
<Pinkies4thWall> That's a word now
<twilight_sprinkle> koko KEEEECK
<brony_655321> The more you know.
<DinkyDoo> Back.
<Babsy> Super saiyan
<Kammerjunk> Really? The only one I had problems with was Twilight.
<GameTaco> Do my eggs smell?
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, whatever happened to the missions shortly after you play?
<rextheponydragon> " im never taking the bus again! hahaha"
<Brony_1337> Just look up Magic Duel mlp on make the filter "Today:
<GameTaco> "Am I Broly?" "No." "Am I Piccolo?"
<pony_3996> No shes an apple
<AJIsAwesome> I can't get Twilight and RD elements.
<Silver_Spoon> I never got the memo. I always thought it was meepmeep
<otakon> on timer aj
<aniderp> i want the mlp fim one!
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: ?
<J_E_Smith71> Imagine if Fluttershy played that game and she had a tree card
<Pinkies4thWall> Wuck Falmart
<rextheponydragon> " b b bad to the bone! "
<otakon> the mini games?
<Kammerjunk> I ended up with 27 RD shards. The Pinkie shards are just annoying to get, though.
<pony_9102> T
<pony_3996> Magic School Bus really needs to be a movie :3
<Pinkies4thWall> Hey, Who has the Gameloft MLP game?
<otakon> yeah the mini games are all on timers
<AJIsAwesome> No, the mini missions that are in the scrolls.
<GameTaco> Fluttershy would just keep generating squirrel tokens.
<otakon> oh
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: What?
<brony_655321> Why the George Thuroughgood....you know what why not?
<MadSurge> cachi01: tbh Twi and RD should be both free :D
<Kammerjunk> And when I say annoying, I mean when you get them all the time.
<otakon> just click the book again
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Oh.
<Brony_1337> I have the Gameloft Game
<rextheponydragon> mlp fim needs to be a movie

<J_E_Smith71> Wrek: Plus you only have an hour and a half till Euornight
<pony_783> did episode 5 come out yet?
<GameTaco> Anyway. I dunno. I guess Hasbro could do well with shows like Freakzoid! only if WB accepts that they're probably not going to do anything with those properties ever again. The question is, will they be the same without Spielberg?
<VenHur> WreK: So how's the episode, Wrek?
<Pinkies4thWall> otakon: that wasn't a subconscious reference to Borderlands 2, was it?
<Sumica> 00,10guess i miss them then wrek
