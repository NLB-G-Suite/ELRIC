<AJIsAwesome> I hope NCS uploads the final part of SoTC soon. I LOVE that game.
<cachi01|phone> METAL I WON
<WindWhistler> I'm saying it right now: Touhou has the best music.

<Unnr> WindWhistler: But which tohou is best tohou?
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: give him some time, you know, IN THE BATHROOM
<WindWhistler> Unnr: That's easy. Mima.

<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: but protonjohn comes really close

<Reikim> If you want to go extreme
<WindWhistler> Well there goes the Touhou discussion...
<WindWhistler> time to add RAY to everyone's names.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: I like him because Chuggaa is a bit too high strung for my tastes.
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: oh, but didnt tim say he loved her in an interview?
<Reikim> Dismantle the damn thing, take out the hard drive, run it by a couple strong electromagnets, and than smash it.
<Shizuka> 13all we want to do is eat your brains
<dynamo2814> well im just dissapointed, i type the lyrics to still alive off of portal and everypony starts typing the rest

<Unnr> AJIsAwesome: while it might be a bit on the sad side, try "A cup of Joe"
<pony_7007> AJIsAwesome: the powers of harmony or smoke and mirrors
<Kimori> what is it?
<DJMidgetBrony> Ìû
<Reikim> EVERYONE should read White Box.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Is it sad?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...what song is this?
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: Not in my opinion.
<SpadeMagnes[R> cachi01|phone: Cheerlie goes nuts and kills all her students and then it goes into saw territory and she killed 5 of the elements of harmony and then twilight is blamed for the incident and she suicides, and it ends with Celestia possibly turning into Nightmare Sol
<dynamo2814> if you havnt already you should definitely read my little dashie
<shibaru> It's hard to explain...
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: :S
<wirisme1989> It is... sad
<SpadeMagnes[R> So yea it...unique...
<Phase4> open firefox and in a new tab go to about:robots
<Unnr> *twitch* I cannot stand My Little Dashie
<wirisme1989> to say the least
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes[R NIGHTMARE SOL XDDD
<MirrorImage> Unnr - ?
<MirrorImage> why not
*Ponies47 Returns from shower
<LoGaN> WHY DOes my cat alWAYS RUB THE CAPS lock key?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Well I cant think of a better name of the equivilent of that for Celestia
<wirisme1989> because it hasn't discovered shift yet
<Dken2021> Robots have shiny metal posteriors which should not be bitten.
<Unnr> Its poorly structured wish fufillment that is extremely creepy once you think about it
<AJIsAwesome> I don't read those kinds of fics. It ruins the image of the character, IMO.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Solar Mare?
<wirisme1989> I don't think it has to ruin anything
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes its funny cause sol is spanish for sun :I
<lbelmore8> LoGaN: it has a fettish
<wirisme1989> as long as you remember it's just a fic
<Bronymorpher> TF2?
<AJIsAwesome> wirisme1989: Even that doesn't help.
<LoGaN> lbelmore8: HAHAHa nice onE
<Barbetos> Fortress FOREVER!!
<Barbetos> Was an interesting mod
<Barbetos> To bad it came out at the same time as TF2, no one noticed it.
<Reikim> Hey, does anyone want a spot on the TF2 game?
<Bronymorpher> this is TF2 right?
<Shizuka> 13sb does
<MirrorImage> i'll join if you got a slot
<Reikim> Sweet. Here ya go, SuperBrony64. You can have my slot.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not like most people who can look at a grimdark fic like Cupcakes and still look and the character the same again. I don't know why.
<Unnr> Think about it, in My Little Dashie, Dash spends several *years* locked up and forced to stay inside most of the time with only one person as their entire social support structure
<Unnr> that is just... *creepy*
<wirisme1989> I do not know this game at all, should I feel bad about myself?
<cachi01|phone> I liek cupcakes
<LoGaN> I REALly hope i dont GET BANNED FOR HAving too many caPS OR I WOULD REally! hurt my CAT
<cachi01|phone> Its funny IMO
<AJIsAwesome> wirisme1989: No.
<Dken2021> wirisme1989 nah, heck, I don't know myself
<AJIsAwesome> LoGaN: Then move your cat.
<cachi01|phone> Watching best pony killing worst pony
<Reikim> Anyway.
<Reikim> White Box. Best fic ever.
<LoGaN> AJIsAwesome: but heS SOOo cute i cant DO THAT TO MAx
<Biglaw> Dat weapon swithch
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: That's what they said about Past SIns.:S
<SpadeMagnes[R> I must be messed up if I read several grimdark fics and have not been bothered by them
<Biglaw> switch*
<cachi01|phone> IMO best fic is Rainbow factory
<Phase4> Shizuka, bug me if a spot becomes avaliable
<MirrorImage> AJIsAwesome - indeed, and here it comes in book form
<cachi01|phone> Spade lol same here
<otakon1> has RAWRity been on yet?
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: I will link you White Box. It's...not sad. It's different depending on what you make of it. (Also it's better than Past Sins)
<Reikim> Like now, Phase4?
<Reikim> Because I just left.
<Unnr> AJIsAwesome: I also didn't care for Past Sins
<Polydunami> Hmm, I'm iffy on grimdark fanfiction after the whole cupcakes craze :S
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> yeah, i decided to see who was still in and it joined me instead
<MirrorImage> Polydunami - just realize that cupcakes is a "different" kind of grimdark
<LoGaN> THATS IT IM MOving my cat
<AJIsAwesome> It's like I said, I'm not like most people who can look at a fic and still look and the character the same again. I don't know why.
<Shizuka> 13sb wants to join, dunno if he will
<Phase4> will take a sec to load
<Shizuka> 13SuperBrony64: coming?
<AJIsAwesome> *at*
<MirrorImage> that was grimdark for the purpose of being disturbing
<Phase4> i'll leave so sb can join, after the damned thing loads anyway
<SaxyPretender> 0,14what song is this, Shizuka?
<wirisme1989> I admit I had to keep reminding myself 'it's not canon' while reading
<AJIsAwesome> That's why I suggested normal fics.
<Eulshy> should i get some keys in tf2?
<Shizuka> 13Blue Man Group - What is Rock
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXZO8KZBziEIEXVW_h5VZtwn41M3yE0_9MX4g9Fjeac/edit?pli=1
<Polydunami> Well, it succeeded in that definition xP
<MirrorImage> this is blue man group? but it has LYRICS!
<AJIsAwesome> wirisme1989: But that's YOU, not ME.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14thankee
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: i think phase might be
<MirrorImage> is SuperBrony64 even here?
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: The story is...itself. I cannot say that it is sad or not, because it depends on how you interpret it. But it is incredibly well-written, and I believe it should be a standard against which fics should be judged.
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: As a bonus, it only involves the Mane6 tangentially.
<cachi01|phone> Pootis
<Biglaw> Why is a spai here
<cachi01|phone> Cause pootis
<Biglaw> >.>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Starting

<WallDives> <2>+P ?
<Science_Brony> no seriously, where is it?

<Science_Brony> I'm missing a sock
<Reikim> BOOOOOOOOO
<Science_Brony> IRL
<Klumzeedragon> Under the bed!
<Athgaar> sock location is a genuine philosophical mystery
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=150882695999
<Hat> I should go searching for the religion that finds my other sock
<NocturnalBlade|TF2> hey Phase4 i would like to call the next open spot...if thats cool
<Kimori> and yes thats real..
<twilight_sprinkle> and now we'll show you how to deliver
*Reikim tosses a tomato
<Hat> Baby pyro
<p4ngya> if there is someone in this world that is not missing a sock, show me your ways!
<Meanwhile> It's launch week, patches galore.
*kirzstryfe revokes SaxyPretender's shade privileges
<Cades> win!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14awww
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;__;
<Meanwhile> hotfixes ahoy.
<Cades> 2.5g lol
<shibaru> Why...
<Reikim> Incidentally, do you lot know why we throw tomatos, anyway?
<Science_Brony> Klumzeedragon my bed is 3 feet above the ground. If it were there, I would see it
*Reikim aside from fun
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Nope
<Kimori> check out the pictures
<kirzstryfe> you'll see updates at least once a week usually after the first week or two
<Klumzeedragon> Hum...
<Science_Brony> those dishes are cool
<Reikim> It's supposed to give you death, that's why.
<twilight_sprinkle> yeha ive heard of this
<kirzstryfe> adding new stuff, events, random stuff
<Klumzeedragon> Under all the other stuff in the sock drawer?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Pretty sweet, huh
<Reikim> So when someone throws a tomato at you, it's because they want you to die.
<Cades> haha
<Science_Brony> I've emptied it out
<Science_Brony> twice
<Science_Brony> today
<scout19> oh god high school :(
<p4ngya> pretty coo'
<Meanwhile> Cheery.
<Reikim> There is your fun fact for the day.
<twilight_sprinkle> and people are actually listening to you... *violin music*
<Science_Brony> once to sort out unmatching socks, and second to find that damn sock
<Reikim> Anyway, it stems from the Shakespearian era of theatre.
<Klumzeedragon> Ah... Then you're suffering from DSD.
<Reikim> Back then, nobody ate tomatos. Why? Ever seen a rotting tomato?
<superretroworld> whats dsd?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I'm hungry now
<Reikim> They thought tomatos were death-fruit. So, if there was an actor on stage that they didn't like, they'd throw a tomato at them.
<MirrorImage> Bill Nye? F*squee*K SLEEP
<thelonepony> DSD?
<Klumzeedragon> Disappearing Sock Disorder.
<Reikim> It's like getting death threats, only it involves squishy fruit.
<wirisme1989> I can't do that!
<Hat> When is Bronystate going to have an inner-eyelid app, where you can watch the stream while you sleep
<Shizuka> 13and then bill nye predicted mythbusters
<Polydunami> Mythbusters proven :3
<Polydunami> Yep
<Reikim> Farmers didn't grow tomatos to eat; they grew them to sell at the theatre.
<Ponies47> So. High school Spirit week is early on in the year this year and on Thursday you get to dress up as your favorite TV show character (Oh God you can only think what I'm thinking :P)
<Athgaar> When you're willing to install a screen inside your eyelid
<scout19> ahhhhh
<Athgaar> and give it an internet connection
<p4ngya> he killed pyro
<Reikim> And now you know that Shakespearian audiences weren't much crueller or stupider than audiences today.
<wirisme1989> for science
<Athgaar> and this is why nobody took the ferengi seriously
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hahahahaha
<scout19> oh no more singing
*Reikim tosses a tomato at SaxyPretender
<Polydunami> dat I will Survive parody :3
<p4ngya> oh there he is :D
<Ninjazz> That's actually kinda funny.

<Moopy> stare master
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: I like those episodes :3
<Kandarihu> There's some wierdness going on in PSO2 now. I log in this morning, and there's Hatsune Miku on the monitors instead of the FMV opening.
<Klumzeedragon> I thought Dragon Wars was... a terrible movie. xD
*Ponies47 Never saw Dragon Wars
<scout19> who told u dat
<otakon> Ponies47: it's horribad
<Dark92Enigma> No spoiling on Dragon Wars......i haven't seen it yet
<shibaru> Earlier,, everything I read was in his voice. It was heaven
<otakon> Kandarihu: I call shenanigans and hacking!
<Kandarihu> Now, both videos are alternating between each other, even while there shouldn't be any video at all.
<Ponies47> otakon: No wonder it's B Movie then! Once I choose Home Alone 4 as my B Movie :D
<Cades> haha
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: You picked it? :D
<WallDives> I need to get around to playing PSO2, but school work says otherwise.
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: As B Movie yesh! :D
<Unnr> Shizuka: you did it, you finally got me to re-install trackmania nations forever
<Kandarihu> otakon, it's a Vocaloid music video centering on PSO2. Lots of it has Miku singing and dancing on the stage in the Shopping District while a bunch of placeholder Arks cheer her on.
<Shizuka> 13you're welcome
<scout19> not spoiling er anything but 1 scean in dragon wars just yells out OUR ARMY SUCHS

<Wrek> 05ooo i finally get to use my caps
<TheRandomkid321> Once all the ads where about asians who will pursue you know they are fake softcore porn pics
<Vivix> you know
<Vivix> I've been getting raunchier and raunchier ads from Mips.tv, I wonder what company they use
*SirGanjalf grabs his crowbar; just in case
<Jmo> Vivix, mips is just trying to hook you up.
<Vivix> I've gotten "fuckfriend" and.. "horny girls" ads and all sorts a weird-
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix brazzers?
<Vivix> not sure- they do not use google adsense at least
<Vivix> Jmo, :__; I don wan a
<MadSurge> Vivix: you too? o__O
<TheRandomkid321> I don't even like speaking of this when wrek is watching...
<Jmo> aww I know you just want me Vivix <3
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> I was snooping around mips site, didn't find anything about it there. It's not a problem, but if the chat is pg-13, so should the ads, right?
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix I agree. But honestly I know of a 6 year old who watches R rated films.
<Vivix> Yeah-
<Wrek> 05thats not the issue
<Wrek> 05the issue is the porn adds
<Vivix> When I was a kid, finding porn was like finding a treasure in the woods. Now it's everywhere
<Wrek> 05which is why we encourage adblock
<TheRandomkid321> Faith in humanity is slowly leaving me
<Vivix> ah yeah
<Jmo> LOL Vivix.
<Jmo> That example D:
<Vivix> We were kids! and we DID find it in the woods
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/BfMBZ
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix you lucky bugger
<Vivix> hehe
<Jmo> Reminds me of the time when I was young I said I was gonna find treasure in my backyard
<Jmo> Ended up digging up a gold ring for my mother
<dshannon> oh yeah the ads, yeah the ones given to me have gone all the way porn
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: Bah, porn! Finding a pic of a pair of boobs was a win!
<dshannon> I just ignore it
<Vivix> yeah, like lingerie ads
<Wrek> 05well i had my first snaps at the age of 3
<Wrek> 05i also played doom at that age

<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> I played doom at age..5 I think?
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek... You keep on believing that.
<Vivix> but dad would noot let me play Wolfenstein 3D
<Jmo> Wolfestein 3D is the best FPS in the world.
<RainbowDash90> seez ponys on the stream monitor again ROFFL
<SirGanjalf> I played GTA at 8
<Jmo> Wolfenstein*
<Vivix> wait, 8 actually
<TheRandomkid321> Games where just about all kid friendly then
<SirGanjalf> I still remember that you character farted and burped when you pressed "Tab":D
<TheRandomkid321> Nowadays with stuff like dead space it sickens me.
<Vivix> one of the first games I played was two dinosaurs beating eachother up on an amiga
<Vivix> SirGanjalf, yeaah
<Wrek> 05TheRandomkid321: kids playign dead space sickens you?
<Wrek> 05pfft
<TheRandomkid321> But in all honesty i played GTA III at nine.
<Wrek> 05ratehr have my kid play dead space and or amnesia
<Jmo> God I love Dead Space.
<Wrek> 05than let them roam the street
<Vivix> Wrek true
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek every ture
<SirGanjalf> TheRandomkid321: I meant the very fist GTA.
<TheRandomkid321> *very
<SirGanjalf> *first
<TheRandomkid321> I knwo you did
<TheRandomkid321> *know
<SirGanjalf> oh
<Evil_Spike> What the heck is this?
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: I dunno. I don't think Mortal Kombat was ever technically kid friendly. :P
<Vivix> I think the first game I played that was borderline inappropriate was Duke Nukem 3D, tits and blood everywhere
<TheRandomkid321> GoldDemoma they actually had kids in the ads.
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Lil_B :)
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix Don't mention duke nukem...
<Gold_Demona> Or Conker's Bad Fur Day. That definitely wasn't.
*TheRandomkid321 sheds a tear
*SirGanjalf also have a TECHNOJOY
<Lil_B> thanks MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Wrek> 05i loved playign shadow warrior and DN3D
<Buytoast> conker's bad fur day was 17+
<Jmo> HAHA Conker's Bad Fur Day
<Wrek> 05when did it come out
<Buytoast> of course it wasn't kid friendly
<Wrek> 0595?
<Jmo> How funny that game was
<Wrek> 0597?
<Vivix> duke nukem? Probably 95
<SirGanjalf> dat hacking
<Vivix> 96 97 usually had started the invasion of3d models
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona true, Conkers Bad Fur day had Insults, Tits, Gore and Death XD
<MLP_Brovakiin> I think my first violent game was 'Soldier of Fortune' when I was 7
<Wrek> 05then i played DN3D at the age of 5 or 6
<SirGanjalf> How appriopriate; i've started playing Uplink recently
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: It had SWEARING in it.
<Wrek> 05the thing is
<Wrek> 05at that age
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Which was completely unheard of in games back then
<Wrek> 05you dont really care about boobs
<Vivix> 1996, yeah
<Wrek> 05you cared alot more about shootign pig cops
<Vivix> yeah, we just laughed at it cause it was..silly
<Wrek> 05than hadning money to the strippers
<TheRandomkid321> Iam 13 and I play violent games. But I once saw a id leaving a store with dead space. a 7 year old kid.
<Wrek> 05dead space is lightweight
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona I like that the XBox Version is the one where "The Great Mighty Poo" got consored Lyrics :/
<Wrek> 05decent combat and fun
<Wrek> 05but its 90% jumpscared
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<Wrek> 05nothing else to it
<TheRandomkid321> Lil_B they bleeped out shit
<Lil_B> TheRandomkid321 yep :/
<MLP_Brovakiin> I loved dead space, I can't wait untill 3
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: The game also had sex in it.
<Wrek> 05i stopped caring for deadspace after the second one
<TheRandomkid321> I liked Assasins Creed. Especially online
<Wrek> 053rd doesnt seem to add much to gameplay
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona but onlöy Off Screen or Indicated I think
<SirGanjalf> Funny how most computers processors in that game are 60Ghz, but you still connect to the net through modem
<Wrek> 05love the universe itself
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Yeah, it was off screen, but the sounds made it obvious. :P
<Wrek> 05but the game mechanics are dull for me now
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, /) yay someone with similar views to me.
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona wich scene was it? I can't quite remember
<Vivix> I've never played Dead Space, glared at it at gamestop but- decided not to get it
<Jmo> Play the first one Vivix
<TheRandomkid321> And once again asians who will pursue me... Sigh
<Jmo> Tis great
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wrek: I just loved stamping to things :3
<Vivix> TheRandomkid321, they're outside now, crawling through the bushes
<SirGanjalf> <= It's funny cause it's true
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: It was with a critter who was cheating on his wife with a flower with huge tits.
<Vivix> I might pick up the first one in town- just to look at it 3 for 2, right?
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona AHH!!! Right XD Dem Tits XD
<SirGanjalf> :D
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, Just wait for a Steam sale, it's like $5 US when on sale.
<Jmo> lol AdamTheDuck
<TheRandomkid321> Grabs Shotgun
<Jmo> I think he wants to avoid the pain of downloading it with his artifact internet.
<Lil_B> I'm looking forward to ZimbiU, the Gamemechanics seem amazing and really unique
<Vivix> but my internet is like 0.6mbps ;__; it's cheaper in time to get it on 3 for 2 sale
<Jmo> And just go with teh disc.
<Vivix> yeah-
<Jmo> Disc/disk, take your pick.
<Wrek> 05i can understand not wantign your kid to play postal though
<Wrek> 05but then again its a bad game in its core
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek Yeah. Isnt thta one of the games that made video games have ratings?
<Vivix> I played postal as a kid
<Wrek> 05aye
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, I know that feeling of being deprived of fast internet speeds :/
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: I thought that was Mortal Kombat.
<Vivix> it was--crazy violent, and I had fun, but I haaate violence. so- can't say it messed me up
<MLP_Brovakiin> Vivix: The internet at my dad's house is liek 0.25 mbps it is awefull :(
<Vivix> AdamTheDuck, it sucks ;__;

<pony_1945> Gargantuan orb weaver.
<Phase4> pony_1945, i'm near melbourne, we dont get those down here thankfully, just redbacks and hunstman
<MadSurge> "Gargantuan" sounds about right
<pony_1945> Huntsman. They always appear around the middle/end of winter.
<pony_1945> WHY? :'(
<LoGaN> I DONT GET IT!
<Phase4> pony_1945, for the fly's
<Phase4> hunstman's are best spiders
<MASF123> The Huntsman always arrives late.
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh I just remembered, happy Winter Wrap Up guys! :P
<pony_1945> That Orb Weaver was about 2 meters away from my front door.
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, how do you mean?

<Phase4> Aps, during intermisson everyone joins a channel and we randomly select someone to chose a movie
<Kandarihu> XylemTube, it's because the guy who's streaming him likes him.
<Aps> Phase4, lol how many people does it generate and wens it happening next in bmn or emn?
<Kandarihu> I really like how the newsletter-less lottery is working.
<Gold_Demona> That's a lot of afternoon tea

<pony_1945> I'll go cliche and say RD. Please don't flame me :'(
<LoGaN> pony_1945: so than name your self skyclearer
<MASF123> RD plz flame me
<BronyInstrumental> my favourite is fluttershy cause i relate to her most :)
<Kandarihu> I suppose that Rainbow Dash's athleticism makes her seem more presentable to non-bronies than the others.
<AdamTheDuck> CeruleanBlue
<AdamTheDuck> ^ it's a song by the way
<pony_1945> Rainbow inspired me to actually do stuff more often.
<MadSurge> AthleticPony :D
<LoGaN> pony_1945: so than make yourself umm... loyal... and then your first name?
<AdamTheDuck> pony_1945, CeruleanBlue :3
<pony_1945> Anyone use Flash? I like Flash.
<Phase4> :<
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Phase4 wakeup call
<pony_1945> The program, I mean.
<Gold_Demona> Pigs in giraffe's clothing
<Phase4> pony_1945, flash is worst software
<LoGaN> Phase4: what :< mean
<pony_1945> :'(
<Phase4> i'll admit their animation tools have done a world of good for both ameture and professional animation
<Kandarihu> Man, I can totally imagine that a couple of months into English PSO2, the monitors will be displaying a short video about the Mane6 becoming Arks.
<Phase4> but flashplayer is the worst piece of [explitive deleted] to ever exist in browsers
<pony_1945> :O
<Kandarihu> I can totally imagine Fluttershy panicking over an Emergency Event (but communicating with mags like she does with animals.
*Phase4 hugs pony_1945

<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, seems like you're Australian too
<LoGaN> you new TheRandomkid321
<TheRandomkid321> Would someone please answer who this is?
<TheRandomkid321> No I'm not new
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: Eddie Izzard
<TheRandomkid321> Right. I didn't notice him with the facial hair
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, Oh thought you were asking who pony_1945 is :3
<TheRandomkid321> Right
<pony_1945> I need a name D:
<TheRandomkid321> Tomorrow I'm getting a pony toy :)
<MadSurge> Yay!
<pony_1945> I currently have.... Twilight and Rainbow.
<TheRandomkid321> I'm getting my sister to help chose which one. She has a natural female instinct.
<LoGaN> i trapped in the bathroom my brother forgot to put toilet paper in the bathroom HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'( CAMERON
<pony_1945> Both from McDonalds. 6_9
<MadSurge> pony_1945: You don't need one right away though :D
*AdamTheDuck is still waiting for Octavia release :3
<Phase4> pony_1945, Twibow or Rainlight?
<LoGaN> im not obsessed i just like the show i dont get toys
<pony_1945> Uhm.
<TheRandomkid321> LoGaN Go out of there naked, grab some toilet paper, and give that brother of yours a bloody middle finger up mate
<LoGaN> TheRandomkid321: mate?
<LoGaN> you from alstrailia
<pony_1945> No-one even says that! :P
<TheRandomkid321> I am only getting a toy to support the show. Hasbro only care about merchandise. Yes I am austarlia
<TheRandomkid321> I say that!
<LoGaN> ok that explains it
<LoGaN> ill brb
<pony_1945> Really? I've never actually head someone say 'Mate' like that. :/
<BronyInstrumental> English chavs say mate as well
<MadSurge> pony_1945: ah, stereotypes :D
<pony_1945> I thought they said 'Chap' and whatnot.
<Pearly> mate = friend :D
<pony_1945> Yeah :D
<BronyInstrumental> pony_1945: that's regular english people
<Pearly> I like how in the uk they say housemate instead of roomate
<BronyInstrumental> pony_1945: CHAVs say mate
<pony_1945> Makes more sense, 'Housemate'.
<pony_1945> They're mates, who live in the same house.
<BronyInstrumental> as a slang for friend, anyway
<pony_1945> Yeah. Right. >_>
<LoGaN> guys im gonna try and make an OC wish me luck ill show you guys when its done
<pony_1945> Yaay!
<AdamTheDuck> Have fun and good luck LoGaN :P
<BronyInstrumental> pony_1945: i trust you know what a chav is?
<pony_1945> I'm expecting you'll explain it? :P
<BronyInstrumental> pony_1945: well do you want me to?

<Phase4> to be fair apple did just spend a butt tonn of money saying samsung phones are similar enough to iphones to be considered clones
<derpy56> what is he doing6_9
<PillowPoni> Phase4 : didn't Apple pay Samsung a ton of money In NICKELS??
<Phase4> anything that happens as a result is entirely their fault
<RainbowFlashbang> He's failhacking, duh! :P

<PillowPoni> Phase4: ohhhh...god I'm dumb lol
<derpy56> ok
<Phase4> PillowPoni, they owe about a billion, it'll be contested in a higher court though
<trollghost> i thought samsung had to pay apple a billion...
<MLP_Brovakiin> Didn't they send apple truckloads of coins?
<trollghost> also, they were going to pay them in nickels, but it would have taken 3000 trucks of nickels so they didnt
<Phase4> it'll be contested
<PillowPoni> Phase4: Mmhmmm...I saw a video of Siri vs the new samsung phone. Samsung phone won that shit
<Phase4> MLP_Brovakiin, joke artical :P

<StinkomanFan> But I'm one of those people who think seeing Garfield and Marmaduke fighting to the death would be a good cage match
<CCCP> Benito Mussolini for prez!
<PsychoticDoc> MASF123|AFK: no, he wasnt tougher, he just put them in ovens
<Buytoast> so people were kicking natives off their land before andrew jackson
<Buytoast> son*
<StinkomanFan> ANDREW JACKSON MADE IT COOL
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: There are still people in Italy today who like Mussolini
<CCCP> Richard Nixon is best president :P
<StinkomanFan> Mussolini was less evil and more crazy.
<Rex_Mundi> Buytoast: It was the freaking "Trail of tears"
<MASF123|AFK> How bout Lauren Faust for president?
<PsychoticDoc> Im 1/8 native american cherokee so i can legally say "you stole my land"
<CCCP> MASF123|AFK Tara Strong
<MASF123|AFK> No NOT Tara Strong
<MASF123|AFK> Oh GAWD no.
<Rex_Mundi> Fluttershy for President!
<RaveBrony> Weird Al for President! :[
<PsychoticDoc> MASF123|AFK: ARE YOU CRAZY?! that would break the goverment!!!
<StinkomanFan> Let's split the difference and have Twilight Sparkle win as a write-in candidate
<CCCP> both israel and palestine need to grow the fuck up
<MASF123|AFK> PsychoticDoc, of course no more govertment! :D
<StinkomanFan> Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny get thousands of write-in votes every year, why not Twilight Sparkle?
<PsychoticDoc> MASF123|AFK: then we would nuke eachother, than fallout would happen
<MASF123|AFK> Exactly
<Dovah> 'Morning everypony.
<MASF123|AFK> :)
<CCCP> hi Dovah
<StinkomanFan> babara anne? ...Aw :(
<Rex_Mundi> Buytoast: Plus, he was unconstitutional because of what he did to the supreem court when they told him 'NO'. Andrew Jackson nearly broke the Republic.
<CCCP> See Israel is like Nazi Germany
<MASF123|AFK> PsychoticDoc, if we are dead there will be no more wars. Think about it.
<MASF123|AFK> It's crazy but true.
<StinkomanFan> This The Doors or Elvis?
<Wrek> 05fundamentalist within ANYTHING is bad
<PsychoticDoc> MASF123|AFK: that would only be because everybody is so fat, we can jump the border fast enough, if at all
<PsychoticDoc> cant*
<StinkomanFan> Could also be Johny Cash...
<CCCP> Cuba is a good country
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: Plenty of worse countries than Cuba out there
<MASF123|AFK> Cuba is corrupt
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi like the USA
<MASF123|AFK> But not the worst country
<PsychoticDoc> lolololololol
<Wrek> 05Cuba does everything but the democracy well
<BaconMane> 0,5Wrek what game is this?
<Wrek> 05very generalized statement
<StinkomanFan> OH BOY, HERE WE GO WITH THE BRITS BEING ALL UPPITY ABOUT THEMSELVES
<MASF123|AFK> Fallout New Vegas
<BaconMane> 0,5Ah, thought it was a fallout game
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03BaconMane: Shaq-Fu
<BaconMane> 0,5Is that slang for stuf?
<BaconMane> 0,5*stfu
<BaconMane> 0,5>:
<CCCP> lol
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It's an actual game :D
<BaconMane> 0,5o
<Wrek> 05i like this sogn
<StinkomanFan> It's a fighting game about Shaq
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek: Cuba has democracy, its just not the freedom thing they got. All Republics are somewhere between Democracy and oligarchy. The United states isnt truly a Democracy, and China isnt totally oligarchic.
<StinkomanFan> The Basketball player
<MASF123|AFK> oh no not Shaq-Fu
<CCCP> Isnt there a website dedicated to finding and destoying every copy of that game StinkomanFan?
<Wrek> 05correction then: cuba does everythign but multiparty systems and freedom of speech well
<MASF123|AFK> yeah there is
<Wrek> 05as a generalization
<StinkomanFan> Still can't tell if that was Elvis, Johny Cash or The Doors
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek: True, only the communist party is allowed to exist, though the people get to elect their offcials. The Castros keep getting reelected.
<CCCP> Castro is awesome
<RaveBrony> My brain has officially been fried with politics
<StinkomanFan> So, anypony here gonna try and win a Saxxy?
<MASF123|AFK> My fried has been brain! :P
<RaveBrony> :D
<BaconMane> 0,5Hey how come there's no reticle?
<MASF123|AFK> Saxxy?
<CCCP> Japan needs to NOT make more nuclear power plants
<StinkomanFan> Saxxy, It's an award for the best TF2 short
<BaconMane> 0,5How are you s'posed to hipfire with no reticle? :/
<CCCP> just like we need to get rid of all of our nuclear weapons and anything similar to it
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: Best way to troll cubans in Florida, shout Viva le castro!
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi lol
<Rex_Mundi> But seriously though, Castro aint that bad really, lots of people blame him for his country being poor. But there are plenty of poor as dirt capitalist countries that have it much worse than Cuba.
<MASF123|AFK> CCCP why that Earthquake that happened?
<StinkomanFan> You know who's worse than Castro?
<StinkomanFan> Kim Jung Il
<MASF123|AFK> or was it a tsunami?
<Rex_Mundi> North Korea is pretty much the worst country ever.
<CCCP> MASF123|AFK yeah
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi Western Propaganda
<StinkomanFan> Kim Jung Il was a crazy bastard who deserved to die in a worse way
<MASF123|AFK> Communisn in North Korea, btw
<MASF123|AFK> Communism
<CCCP> StinkomanFan uh he invented the cheese burger!
<Rex_Mundi> heh, north Korea never had communism
<MASF123|AFK> it didn't?
<StinkomanFan> CCCP name me ONE good thing about Kim Jung Il, and McDonalds invented the Cheesburger you liar!
<MASF123|AFK> :D
<BaconMane> 0,5Lol politics
<BaconMane> 0,5screw that
<Rex_Mundi> MASF123|AFK: North Korea- Communist in name only, and they dont even claim that anymore.
<StinkomanFan> Actually, I'm going to go look that up
<MASF123|AFK> BaconMane you and me both
<CCCP> StinkomanFan http://listverse.com/2010/05/30/top-10-crazy-facts-about-kim-jong-il/ look at number 7
<MASF123|AFK> Screwing politics, not each other I mean! :O
<StinkomanFan> The cheeseburger was invented in 1926 by Lionel Sternburger
<BaconMane> 0,5:I
<MASF123|AFK> Politics are in RED DEAD REDEMPTION and I don't understand any of it.
<MASF123|AFK> Sternburger!
<StinkomanFan> Nah, the politics in RDR is actually just Black Mail
<Rex_Mundi> The Dear leader is far more like a Pharoe than a communist.
<MASF123|AFK> Howard Stern and burger cames to mind
<MASF123|AFK> comes
<StinkomanFan> Sternberger, my bad
<Buytoast> politics and blackmail aren't that differnt sonny jim
<Rex_Mundi> Has howard stern said anything about Bronies again since?
<MASF123|AFK> There not? But isn't Blackmail illegal?
<MASF123|AFK> They're
<Buytoast> you think that stops people?
<MASF123|AFK> no
<MASF123|AFK> Hell no, but then pollictics should be illegal then.
<MASF123|AFK> politics
<MASF123|AFK> Damn keyboard
<StinkomanFan> And the HAMBURGER was invented in the 12 century using Horse Meat
<MASF123|AFK> Horse meat...YUM. :)
<CCCP> StinkomanFan awww :(
<CCCP> StinkomanFan why would you wish for death to happen to anyone? :(
<Rex_Mundi> I dont know why Horse meat isnt allowed in the USA, thats stupid.
<MASF123|AFK> Everyone dies one way or another
<StinkomanFan> It was gonna happen eventually CCCP, but I was hoping a more ironic one for him
<MASF123|AFK> so check out my message to you!
<StinkomanFan> Like a statue of himself falling atop of him.
<MASF123|AFK> If The Scatman could do it so can you!
<CCCP> StinkomanFan thats pretty harsh you know
<MASF123|AFK> ...sorry Lol. R.I.P Scatman John
<StinkomanFan> Again, name me one TRUE GOOD thing about Kim Jung-Il
<MASF123|AFK> He's Asian
<MASF123|AFK> There you go.
<Dovah> StinkomanFan: He died?
<StinkomanFan> And that's about all you can name, He's asian and he's dead
<CCCP> StinkomanFan well we dont have much info on North Korea so its kinda hard
<RaveBrony> I need to go listen to Scatman now
<RaveBrony> :D
<Rex_Mundi> Does anyone ells think that this time of year is weird? Its too different from Fall and the rest of summer.
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek, you should heal yourself
<Dovah> Scatman?! Where!?!
<CCCP> StinkomanFan so every one has to change the world to be respected after they die?
<StinkomanFan> I am not going to respect a lunatic who tortures his own country
<CCCP> StinkomanFan then why you respect any president eve?
<CCCP> ever*
<StinkomanFan> Because they were fairly elected and not self-appointed
<StinkomanFan> Except for Nixon
<StinkomanFan> Fuck Nixon

<MASF123|AFK> Don't call his daddy fat, have you no respect?
<Flyboy> i think he meant flattered
<Vivix> I didn't see the typo until now! *very offended
<StinkomanFan> My dad's fat, I can only assume all dads are fat

<Wrek> 05they didnt have any
<Sundaysmile> ada strauss not have any?
<Vivix> My main bass is decorated with frills, lace, pinkie pie doll and jewlery, even hte metalheads in college were nice abot it
<Maid_RainBow> goodbye Everypony
<CCCP> bye Maid_RainBow
<CCCP> <3
<Rex_Mundi> Vivix: Metalheads tend to be chill people, so long its the ones that realize how rediculous (and fun) metal is, and not the ones that take themselvs too seriously.
<Vivix> yeah, most metal heads I know are nice, but most I meet online can be--pretty mean
<Jmo> Metal ;~;
<Vivix> the weirdest metal head at that school that looked like he lived on a yacht, you know short blonde hair slicked back, sunglasses and open shirt and shorts. and he played death metal drums
<Vivix> My mind was blown of stereotypes
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Rex_Mundi> You think bronies are misrepresented in the Media? Ever watch one of those Crime drama shows? if there is an episode that involvs metal fans, its always satanism and "hardcore" stuff...
<Vivix> yeah-
<killerpony7733> It's called stereotypes
<killerpony7733> A excuse to see something as negative
<CCCP> there is no escape
<Rex_Mundi> Of coarse, the Furries have it the worst when it comes to steriotypes....
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi no not really
<Lil_B> can i somehow change my Password for my name?
<CCCP> I feel like racial sterotypes are worse
<Vivix> I''ve met more people who believe the furry stereotype than believe any racial ones
<CCCP> so many people on the internet are racist asshole, and are like "racsim is natural"
<killerpony7733> Vivix I know how it is,
<Jmo> klrpwny73 pls.
<Eulshy> oh cool wreks streamin
<Jmo> u no nthng
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> totally CCCP lol cant watch Tosh.0 with it having at least 1 racial joke,its like "really? jeez :S"
<Jmo> <3
<killerpony7733> Jmo pls <:
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi but the steriotype is somtimes true
<killerpony7733> Wrek Found the armory in the vault yet?
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP: Yeah, there are some furries that make me shake my head...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> eeyup
<Vivix> like most places, yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> Does that rad meter go from left to right, or right to left?
<Sundaysmile> Right to left I think
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> say did fallout get any mlp mods?
<killerpony7733> Rex_Mundi Every fandom/community has a the major and quiet then the more middle ones that are at times a bit vocal but ok mostly, Then extreme fanatics
<Vivix> some gun mods, and someone working on a total conversion
<MASF123|AFK> Fuck
<Vivix> fanatics are the spooky ones, and the loud ones that represent the fandom
<MASF123|AFK> I only want to play games in life.
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi also many bronies are steriotypical bronies, you cant deny that.
<MASF123|AFK> I want to appreciate life more. :(
<killerpony7733> Vivix Generally what stereotypes are based on too....
<MASF123|AFK> But how?
<MASF123|AFK> CCCP I don't clop thank you very much.
<CCCP> MASF123|AFK appreciating life is like trying to appriaciate shit
<MASF123|AFK> Or likc the pony toy asses
<Lil_B> good... Defence Grid 2 and Project Giana god funded, looking forward too them :)
<Vivix> hehe
<CCCP> MASF123|AFK i never said you did
<Vivix> I love life, despite it not being-perfect
<MASF123|AFK> CCCP how does that make me feel better?
<CCCP> MASF123|AFK oh im sorry :(
<MASF123|AFK> I can't appreciate a huge hunk of duty
<Rex_Mundi> MASF123|AFK: Who brought up clop?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Change of topic, Soo who likes muffins?
<Lil_B> MASF123|AFK I always think "Beeig dead sucks... I can't even Talk to people, eat, drink, play or move :( ... or watch MLP :P"
<MASF123|AFK> Rex_Mundi, CCCP said most Bronies are streotypical clopping is a stereotype for us.
<Dark_Horst> oh biy, dragonwars for b-movie
<Vivix> no, not most, some- didn't he say that?
<killerpony7733> Vivix A good saying i got in my head is, ''If you can't accept life as it is and realise *perfect* is a very bad term to use as you can't be good at everything or anything like that. Maybe you aren't exactly fit for the world''
<MASF123|AFK> Hmm...Interesting look at it Lil_B
<CCCP> MASF123|AFK i didnt say all bronies are i just said most...
<CCCP> pegasisters go in there too
<kirzstryfe> everypony clops, didn't you know that? :3
<MASF123|AFK> I know MOST but I am in that catergory am I not?
<Vivix> killerpony7733, good words, yeah. I try to- I have like most people som issues, but- life is a fun journey, no matter where I end up
<Rex_Mundi> The thing about furries is that its a diverse fandom with different communities. Id say Furaffinity is the best (although somewhat hostile and trollish) community, wear as So furry is full of degenerates
<killerpony7733> Wrek I think the all american is around somwwhere
<CCCP> and just becasue some one is a steriotype doesnt mean there a bad person
<Lil_B> CCCP Bronystate is one of the most sane Brony places, that's why I generally hang out here :)
<Sundaysmile> depends on the stereotype though...
<killerpony7733> Vivix Indeed though not every turn is fun or good for you, You gotta accept life will not bend to your will.
<Dark_Horst> i think i came back to the right kind of discussion B)
<killerpony7733> Do with what you have, not what you don't
<CCCP> Lil_B it still has its moments
<Vivix> of course, bad things happen, and once you accept that, it won't hurt as much
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so just saw a trailer announcing Gotham City Imposters is free to play,wonder if itll be f2p on consoles as well?
<Sundaysmile> got some lethal rad sickness there wrek
<Lil_B> for example, I'm going on a Meetup tomorrow, and I know that it will be filled with shirts endless quotes, and pony songs
<kirzstryfe> "All Canadians are half-bear axe murderers" is not a stereotype
<kirzstryfe> it's a fact of life
<Vivix> hehe
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<killerpony7733> Vivix Very much so. Some people look weird at me when i shrug things off due to accepting as a fact ot life
<CCCP> why do most comments say shut up and listen to the music? then whats the comment section for?
<CCCP> on yt
<killerpony7733> Wrek Did you get the all american?
<Lil_B> All germans are Jew killing Warlovers... a Stereotype I have too face way too often on the Web
<MadSurge> Guys, sorry if I'm being silent, but I learned that one of my highschool classmates hanged herself. Sorry if I'm a party pooper or I'm not wacky at the moment, but...
<Dark_Horst> even better are the kind of people who are convinced everbody hates germans
<CCCP> MadSurge :(
<CCCP> im so sorry
<CCCP> thats horrible
<BronyInstrumental> Lil_B: unfortunately so, i see it happen a lot. i have to deal with a lot of people thinking i wear a top hat and a monacle and have a handlebar moustache all the time :/
<MLP_Brovakiin> MadSurge: Oh jeez, you have my condolences :(
<Rex_Mundi> So what are the brony sterotypes? I dont think most people know of the adult artwork, I think they percieve us more as man-children who refuse to grow up. And that is false
<BronyInstrumental> MadSurge: oh dear. many condolences my friend :(
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, I think the stereotype is manchildren, yeah. Basement dwellers like that nerd collector episode for powerpuff
*Sketch_Toku_Brony hugs MadSurge :(
<Wrek> 05if swearing is immature, then why is it reffered to as adult language?
<Vivix> I'm sorry to hear that MadSurge, always suck to have that happen
<Lil_B> MadSurge that is terrible... :(
<MadSurge> I don't even want to cry...
<MASF123|AFK> A lot of adults are immature Wrek
<killerpony7733> Honestly swearing helps expressing yourself thought not pleasantly, it's a way to express yourself
<CCCP> being Mature is a sign of self hate and stupidity
<Sundaysmile> now you're catching on CCCP
<Vivix> I was raised not knowing what swearing was
<Vivix> my principal washed my mouth with soap
<Rex_Mundi> How does that CS luis quete go? The desire to be grown up is a sighn of immaturity?
<Jmo> As did I
<MASF123|AFK> It's a way to lack use of vocabulary and use fuck or shit for anything in a conversation
*Jmo washes Vivixs mouth with soap
<Sundaysmile> Scottish here, learned to swear before I learned to walk
<BronyInstrumental> i grew up around swearing, i just never was told what they meant so i never needed to use them
<CCCP> MadSurge *hugs again :*
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> :3
<Vivix> trønder here, tons of swearing here, but I hardly swear anymore
<MASF123|AFK> Holy fuck that shit was fucking shit you know? Like.....FUCK man.
<pony_7007> be mature when the need arises, other wise, have fun like children
<Jmo> ø
<Jmo> wat
<Jmo> o.o
<Vivix> "Jævla høtta oppe derre fanes skau hælvett, sku dratt se ut på den jævla sjøn med dere helvettes båtn'"
<Buytoast> is someone bitching that swearing is immature?
<MASF123|AFK> Lol. Your a bitch.
<Rex_Mundi> *hugs vivix*
<Jmo> WUT.
<MadSurge> Thanks a lot guys. Much appreciated.
<BronyInstrumental> english here, i only swear around my friends/people i feel comfortable around
<Sundaysmile> I thought it was you lol
<MASF123|AFK> FUCK
*Vivix hugs Rex_Mundi
<MASF123|AFK> Let's keep swearing. Nothing wrong with that. Lol. >_>
<killerpony7733> A better way to say it is, Enjoy life like you would as a kid, But still take it serious and face it with a maturity.
<MadSurge> ^
<Buytoast> well no shit
*MASF123|AFK sighs
<MASF123|AFK> so true...
<MASF123|AFK> :/
<Vivix> the only swearing I think is absoutlely horrible, is when people do it in other langauges, like people swearing in english in Norwegian sentences, or english with german swears, etc- or the typical japanese swears
<Lil_B> I think "damn" is the wors word I use :/ ... I just have no need for the other words :/
<Vivix> I say fuck as an exaggerated joke sometimes
<Vivix> because its so fast and loud-
<Sundaysmile> Vivix is a baka gaijin
<Vivix> buck u budi
<Sundaysmile> like that?
<MASF123|AFK> I keep hearing fuck in like every sentence in Mafia 2 which makes it feel less original when they spam a swear.
<Vivix> yeah
<Lil_B> Vivix I generally dislike people using foreign words they don't even know the meaning of
<Vivix> and like typical oslo gangsta kid around norway is like- every otehr word is FACK in broken english
<Vivix> yeah
<CCCP> i think that swearing just for no reason is fucking stupid and fucking ponitless
<BronyInstrumental> i only ever swear in public in japanese, cause i know a few in japanese
<Sundaysmile> or like that guy from District 9
<Sundaysmile> Fookin prawns!
<Rex_Mundi> hey Vivix, do you have a picture of your frill lacey bass?
<killerpony7733> Vivix I hear way too many young danes using mixed danish an english which sounds horrible at times
<MadSurge> If I was in a better mood I'd wax on about how Italy swearing involves God and all the Saints
<CCCP> MadSurge *hugs again*
<Lil_B> well... I would swear in different languages to be weird and nonsensical again XD
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, parts of it, I can try taking a picture of the headstock, even if its a bit tattered atm
<Vivix> killerpony7733, yeaah, it sounds really odd-
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: i lost my wallet today, but i found it again :3
<Lil_B> MadSurge it's ok, you did nothing wrong :)
<killerpony7733> Vivix And worst yet, Most that do it are those people who dress as if they were gangsters or rappers or heck if i know
<BronyInstrumental> good thing too, it has all the cash for my bass in it
<Vivix> BronyInstrumental, hehe, I lost my credit card, found it a few days ago after 2 months without it
<Vivix> I got 2000 dollars on it after paying bills, thanks to having lost it
<MadSurge> Lil_B: but what if I payed attention? I could have talked her out of it...
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: credit cards suck. i'm never getting one
<killerpony7733> Vivix What type of credit card?
<Vivix> bankcard, I don't have credit on it, but it's easier to say
<Jmo> Wow Vivix, sucks to be you bro.
<Sundaysmile> A credit card is handy if you treat it wisely
<MASF123|AFK> I had a Debit Card.
<Lil_B> today I wore my Pony shirt today, they joke obout it in a fashion that I'm able to laugh aout myself too... and they still have no Idea about MLP XD
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: hell, i don't even have a debit card yet, all my money is cash
<Vivix> the only loan I have is studenet loan
<Vivix> ah yeah- loosing cash is D=
<Jmo> HAHA Student loan.
<Vivix> ;__;
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<Jmo> You poor muffin
*Vivix licks Jmo's face
<BronyInstrumental> i don't need a student loan, education is free in england :3
<Vivix> hehe it is here too
<Vivix> but college is not
<BronyInstrumental> college is too :P
<Vivix> well, 50% is payed if you pass
<Vivix> here it depends on the college
<killerpony7733> Vivix I use a mastercard and it has one down side here in denmark though, Some stores refuse to have it as a payment method but else it's god damn good as a international card to pay with
<Vivix> I took a nondegree musical college, it's private own and costs money
<BronyInstrumental> all education is free in england, apart from like private tutors of musical lessons, THOSE cost
<Vivix> aah killerpony7733 my parents use mastercard- I only have Visa, withou credit
<Lil_B> MadSurge you don't have to blame yourself, you weren't he only person who had a chance to stop it, nobody saw it coming appearently
<Vivix> Don't lipa cost like thousand of thousands of euro?
<Vivix> Liverpool institute of performance art
<MASF123|AFK> Wrek you drew that background?
<killerpony7733> Books!
<MASF123|AFK> Twilight
<BronyInstrumental> idk, i don't live in liverpool :P
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I told only my best friend about ponies and he was like "WTF", but then I showed him the Big Lebowski Ponies and that apparently was enough to change his mind :D
<Vivix> I think schools like that cost money since they aren't government owned, I think LIPA costs quite a bit
<BronyInstrumental> wouldn't surprise me
<BronyInstrumental> but i don't need to worry about the rest of the world for a while, i'm still in high school
<Lil_B> MadSurge XD I guess I actually have no reference to show them :/ none of them are even Cartoon or Animation fans :/ (well, 2 were and I told them XD but they haven't watched anything yet)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: this guy likes Spongebob and Fairy Oddparents
<LoGaN> who does?
<BronyInstrumental> i lol'd when i learned that most people in my school knew about bronies before I did, and i am one :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge I don't know the later one, but If I knew someone who still likes Spongebob in my class I would show him MLP XD
<BronyInstrumental> Lil_B: :O you've never seen the fairy odd parents?
<Vivix> Fairy oddparents is pretty fun at times
<Vivix> I'm a cartoon nerd, so mlp was inevitable-
<alexxm> i remember when fairy odd parents started
<BronyInstrumental> i loved fairy odd parents, and spongebob back when it was good
<Lil_B> BronyInstrumental never heard of it ... maybe in german though
<MadSurge> BronyInstrumental: neither did I
<SpeedyBolt> Oh my...
<BronyInstrumental> Lil_B: i shall google translate it and see if it rings a bell to you :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> djwrek?
<LoGaN> Wrek: no
<Lil_B> BronyInstrumental just show me the wikipedia article, they change some titles to whatever they want in germany XD
<BronyInstrumental> Lil_B: ziemlich seltsam Eltern

*Ponies47 Dances
<killerpony7733> Vivix I'm however pleasantly surprised MLP FIM has not been shown on any known cartoon channel so far atleast here in denmark
<Rex_Mundi> Its 12:20PM where I live right now
<Wrek> 05wub wub wub
<Barbetos|AtWork> No Ponies47 this is a NO FUN ZONE.
<killerpony7733> It's 6:19 PM here
<Barbetos|AtWork> STOP.
<Vivix> killerpony7733, really? We have it on boomerang at veeery irregular times-
<Vivix> I thouht boomerang owned the rights in entire scandinavia, hm
*Ponies47 Dances on Barbetos|AtWork 's head
<Wrek> 05wub wub wub
<Flyboy> is this a pendulum song?
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: I know they aired FiM on two channels here in Italy, no more
<Flyboy> i recognise the style
<Ponies47> Wrek: All da wub
<Barbetos|AtWork> Stop you criminal scum! You have broken the lawl!!
<killerpony7733> Vivix Idunno again i had VERY little time on the TV since i am on the PC mostly. But i know we don't have MLP FIM on the channels we have in my home
<BronyInstrumental> i don't get the hub, MLP FiM isn't shown on boomerang in england anymore : <
<Flyboy> BronyInstrumental: ikr :(
<Ponies47> BronyInstrumental: Awww :<
<Vivix> killerpony7733, aww- yeah we have it on boomerang, as said, but it's very hard to catch since both boomerang and CN sometimes seem to be on shuffle
<MadSurge> BronyInstrumental: thank goodness for the internet!
<Vivix> if the contracts run out in europe, they can sell it on itunes internationally
<Vivix> until the contracts run out, we can't buy the show on itunes
<BronyInstrumental> it was on boomerang for like a week, but i rebuffed it for the obvious reasons when i first saw it
<MLP_Brovakiin> BronyInstrumental: you can't get anything MLP related in england :(
<killerpony7733> Vivix Well i'm SURE that if you have like one of the super channel packs for your TV you could get to find it. But that would cost lotsa money
<Wrek> 05i like this song
<Lil_B> I can watch all the german MLP Episodes in the Nick site ... for free and legal :/ Question... do I want too?
<killerpony7733> Wrek indeed

<alexxm> this amuses me
<Vivix> Sumica is the one who streams from hub directly?

*Ponies47 Makes "Me Gusta" face

<Dovah> Scoot-Scootaloo: you should play all the literal versions.

<pass> that was me and a fake username
<Vivix> We moved from a 16mbps line to a 0.6, considering going wireless to see if its faster-
<Kammerjunk> Still makes more sense than the actual sense.
<Lil_B> Vivix enough to do anything... except downloading and watching videos
<cachi01|phone> dammit pass!
<Ponies47> Back
<pass> lol
<Kammerjunk> than the actual song*

<Lil_B> Vivix: mmm... I usually didn't had to buffer for 480p YT Videos with 360kbit/s ... (but I still watched at 3060 most of the time wo be shure to not buffer) ... maybe it's something else with your connection
<Buytoast> And on that day, Uncle Sam lifeted his fat folds and a thousand eagles showed MURIKA with cheeseburgers and free medicare.
<Buytoast> And everyone clapped.

<Kammerjunk> Dat timing.
<RaveBrony> Oh god :D
<Kammerjunk> Perfect timing.
<Vivix> Lil_B, might be- 240 runs smooth to me, but 360 takes a buffering, yeah- the connection here is borderline, when we ordered the ISP told us they could not guarantee any speeds to us, and therefore would not let us pay more than minimum package
<pass> YES :D
<WallDives> I need to play MWC.
<CCCP> IshNewLaptopPony hug?

<Vordox> Inb4 MULTIKILL
<XylemTube> Hey boys, it's a spy!
<Vordox> RATATATAT
<FlutterMEDIC> TWILIGHT GATLING GUN!
<Anotherguy> It was very stupid debate
<AJIsAwesome> It was all because of one stupid sound effect...
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome spike isn't in that scene anyway :/ but rarity is there, and everyone else got one :(
<Ponies47> XylemTube: Spy around here
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: haven't you seen Bronies React To? He explicity tells us 30 times it's not a kiss
<robotdragon9> i hate it when the hub causes stupid shipping kiss debates...
<RaveBrony> Lil_B: Yeah :(
<Rex_Mundi> Who tells us?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I actually don't hear people saying spike is their favorite.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Fighting Feelings
<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: It's more of the fans than the show itself.
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: Spike aint pony
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I remember FlutterDash fans went nuts!
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome (I ment it more as a joke anyway... but still like to point it out)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anyway, time for nostalgia!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Vordox: I knew that.
<RaveBrony> Kiss? wait,what? I mustve missed something O_o
<Anotherguy> Nostalgia
<Rex_Mundi> In anycase... <3Cadance<3
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: He's his own poll =3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I mean it. Nostalgia.
<Anotherguy> ?
<Dken2021> Kawaii_icybeauti hmm, wonder if he has less fans than applejack
<Kandarihu> Kawaii_icybeauti, the debate is usually as to who is best pony. And Spike isn't a pony.
<RAWRity> looking at the actual animation, it's kiss on the nose. But hey, we also took "you're game?" in a totally different direction too so, hey whatever.
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: Well, between Crackle and Spike
<Kandarihu> Spike isn't best pony, but he's best dragon.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dken2021: Oh totally.
<Anotherguy> OH.

<Ponies47> If sea ponies are in season 3 that would be AWESOME!
<Vordox> lawl CamelTovler
<Dken2021> Sumica from that other episode?
<Kandarihu> Yeah. The term Sea Pony implies that they live in saltwater, but it's a river so it's freshwater.
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: THere's another one?
<Vordox> Ponies47: People would bitch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Funfact: Lauren wanted to make a Seapony episode
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It never got made under her watch

<Brad__> MadSurge, abs plastic
<StinkomanFan> Going to play TF2. Have fun guys
<AJIsAwesome> Forget it. I'm using Iris.
<alexxm> bye StinkomanFan
<prince-dari> You should totally find a filly Dash model too
<Ponies47> Bye StinkomanFan
<Brad__> prince-dari, Ill look around/.
<Brad__> I want to get some paints and try my hand at painting them up
<CK|GW2> If only the fight in Diablo 3 was even half this cool.
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone logged on Flash?
<Brad__> or maybe it would be easier to just order the right color of plastic for each model... dont think the shades will be perfect though.
<Kandarihu> I've been feeding my PSO2 mag for a while now. It's Lvl 73 now. It won't be long before I'll have to start being careful about what it's stats are.
<CK|GW2> New Jersey is worst Middle Earth
<Malk> flash? AJIsAwesome
<alexxm> what do these guys have against new jersey
<Tovler> New Jersey is Mordor
<AJIsAwesome> Malk: lightIRC.
<Malk> LightIRC? AJIsAwesome?
<AJIsAwesome> Malk: The one chat where you can use emoticons.
<Fl00tersh41> Tovler: Hey now, it may be a hellish wasteland and all, but Mordor ain't THAT bad
<Kandarihu> Malk, LightIRC is the default IRC client here.
<EonMaster> how can they be lost when they can see where they need to go?
<Tovler> o-o must.vote.ron.paul.
<CK|GW2> NOOOOO
<Brad__> with a sharpie marker for size reference http://i.imgur.com/BgwME.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> Pony jerky? NOO!!!!!
<Kandarihu> Tovler, don't spoil the vote.
<Xaiphafonese> Sam : "this is the most i've complained about mordor since i left the shire...." Frodo: "Sam....shut up"
<AJIsAwesome> Brad__: How much did the printer + supplies cost?
<Tovler> Kandarihu: but.the.dark.one.commands.
<Brad__> AJIsAwesome, about $800 for the printer + 2 rolls of plastic
<AJIsAwesome> Brad__: Cool.
<Brad__> plastic is about $50 a kg, or 2.2 pounds
<Kandarihu> Tovler, but you don't have to obey
<Malk> Kandarihu why wouldnt he obey?
<Brad__> Im going to make more if anyone wants one once I feel less sick from inhaling acetone fumes.
<Brad__> Might make some larger ones as well.
<Brad__> maybe 2x or 3x scale
<CK|GW2> LOL
<Shizuka> 13it's true, sailor moon costumes are the leading cause of glomps
<Fl00tersh41> Kandarihu: Wouldn't being given a choice kind of defeat the whole "magical ring that subverts it's weilders mind" thing?
<AJIsAwesome> Finally, it works now.
<Malk> :S
<CK|GW2> xD
<Tovler> but srsly what's with Rifftrax. They've been bashing Ron Paul since 2006.
<CK|GW2> It's true. We kittens do not like going for walkies.
<Kandarihu> Dear Princess Celestia, today I realized that pausing the stream means I won't necessarily understand what everypony's talking about.
<Vivix> Who the hell is Ron Paul?
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: Opinions.
<Shizuka> 13ron paul fans are typically very overzealous about it
<Shizuka> 13they practically turned into OWS the other night at the RNC
<Vivix> Acronyms blew my mind
<Kandarihu> Vivix, an ultra isolationist GOP presidential candidate. He's had some good stances and some bad stances.
<AJIsAwesome> SEEMS LEGIT.
<Vivix> Aah
<Brad__> I laughed at a comment last night on an episode, "twilight goes into the forest to meet with some african chick, gets stoned."
<Malk> Shuizuka actually ron paul is very popular
<CK|GW2> He's got some decent ideas. But his fanbase is more overzealous than any I've seen.
<Tovler> but OWS doesn't exist. Even Michael Moore has forsaken it.
<alexxm> whats OWS
<Kandarihu> Most of his good policies are going through Congress anyway
<CK|GW2> Under Precious~
<AJIsAwesome> Sam'g got the right idea.
<Shizuka> 13paul runs the libertarian ideals pretty well, but ultra isolationism failed years upon years ago
<Kandarihu> alexxm, Occupy Wall Street. The Democratic Party's attempt at making their own version of the Tea Party
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah cool rifftrax
<Shizuka> 13sticking your fingers in your ears and going LA LA LA LA LA doesn't typically work
*Vivix is not american, has no idea
<CK|GW2> Yeah, it's too late for isolationism.
<Klumzeedragon> Good afternoon my little ponies! :)
<alexxm> oh ok Kandarihu
<CK|GW2> Much, much too late.
<Shizuka> 13Vivix: be thankful, american politics is.... brr
<Vivix> hehe
<alexxm> how you doing Klumzeedragon
<CK|GW2> Vivix: You are lucky then.
<Malavolent> Good evening everypony.
<CK|GW2> Dat march theme
<Vivix> Here, everyone kinda agrees but kinda disagrees, so voting is like--watteful unless you really know politics
<Vivix> and I don't
<Kandarihu> BTW, the OWS protesters, those guys aren't libertarians.
<Shizuka> 13orc strong but they not smart
<alexxm> how've things been Malavolent
<Malk> Kandarihu hear about they got rid of all maine convention delegates?
<AJIsAwesome> Malavolent: Hello!
<Tovler> OWS didn't have anyone in charge and they had no goals. They were just attention whores.
<CK|GW2> Good thing that hobbits don't smell like manflesh, then, otherwise that'd be a false positive
<Kandarihu> Malk, no I didn't
<Malavolent> alexxm: Ugh, I'm tired and there are only 2 days left before I have to return to school.
<Brad__> In Canada, we have like 2 elections a year.
<Malavolent> alexxm: What about you?
<alexxm> i'm good Malavolent
<Malk> Kandarihu ron paul won maine hands down and the gop got rid of them
<Shizuka> 13gotta give the orcs credit, they smell our heroes even though they're like a day ahead or more
<Kandarihu> Tovler, there were people in charge of OWS. They just kept themselves hidden in order to make it look organic.
<Tovler> Kandarihu: lol @ "some people"
<CK|GW2> Shizu: And it's awful lucky that hobbits smell totally different, because otherwise it'd be a massive plothole that Frodo and Sam can so easily sneak through their ranks with such a terrible disguise.
<Fl00tersh41> Shizuka: It's because haven't bathed since they set out from Rivendel
<Shizuka> 13Fl00tersh41: right..... good point
<Shizuka> 13well, presumably they bathed in lorien
*Scoot-Scootaloo Pinkie_Pie is best room
<Malavolent> Shizuka: My whole life is a lie.
<Shizuka> 13but true, from the end of fellowship to now must be a few weeks, rohan's quite a ways from the waterfall
<Malk> Cant beleive you dint hear about that Kandarihu
<Fl00tersh41> Shizuka: Just imagen how Gimli must smell after practically bathing in orc blood for days in Morias mines
<alexxm> they're taking the hobbits to isanguard
<CK|GW2> Aquaman!
<Kandarihu> The whole thing was clearly astroturf. Professionally-made signs, luxury catering, and all the love from the msm.
<Shizuka> 13he could simply walk into mordor, kill them all with the stench
<pony_364477> So whats going on with the main chat room? I cant log in
<Kandarihu> Malk, in fact, I didn't.
<Xaiphafonese> yea but smells like tht on dwarves only last for a short while
<CK|GW2> Shizu: But....but one does not simply do that D:
<Fl00tersh41> Shizuka: Throw in a few days of sweaty cross country running
<Kandarihu> pony_364477, are you unable to claim your normal nick?
<Nyst> I wonder if Sauron has another tower for his second eye.
<MirrorImage> Nyst - you haven't seen the other side of the planet
<Shizuka> 13Nyst: he's a demoman
<Nyst> Depth-perception and all that.
<MirrorImage> it makes the view from outerspace hilarious
<Malk> Kandarihu Its amazing that they did that I think what they did just plain take the honor out of the gop
<MirrorImage> ...and buffer >_<
<Shizuka> 13clearly monoculus moved to middle earth and set up shop
*Tovler looks at all the candidates OWS put in for this election.
<Nyst> Shikuza: you mean he has a second tower of his hand holding a bottle of booze that give the finger?
<Kandarihu> Tovler, what candidates?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ugh. Buffles the Clown is buffering my video. Do not want.
<Xaiphafonese> nah Sauron has been more like a one eyed monster dicking with everyone fore awhile now
<Shizuka> 13mount doom is the booze
<MirrorImage> mount booze?
<Tovler> Kandarihu: exactly
<Malk> Tovler they didnt have candidates it was just a protest
<CK|GW2> Nyst: A lack of depth perception would explain why he has so much trouble telling how close he is to the source of ALL OF HIS POWER. :P
<pony_364477> I try to log in, and I get this message "Flash policy problem. If you are the server owner please read...
<Shizuka> 13oh good the spoilers have started...
<Tovler> dare I? …clicks
<MirrorImage> it's not spoiler
<CK|GW2> ....dat FF extension. ._.
<Nyst> There is no time when less work gets done in politics then during an election.
<MirrorImage> zap2it was EQD's source of spoilers, and evidently they done mixed up MLP with another show
<RivaLz> anyone else getting a "Steam has detected a problem and has to be closed" problem after starting TF2? Since the Steam client update from today i cant play TF2 anymore -_-
<Cypresswolf> Must avoid EQ.D for awhile now
<Kandarihu> Malk, so was the Tea Party. But we -...OH NOES!
<Shizuka> 13hey saavedro! how's narayan doing
<MirrorImage> Cypresswolf - it's not spoilers
<Kandarihu> Treehouse TV is airing Season 3 ahead of The HUB?
<Klumzeedragon> alexxm: Im good! Got some lunch, hence my delay, and how are you?
<CK|GW2> Wormtongue is really, really pale. I mean, he makes me look tanned.
<alexxm> i'm good Klummzeedragon
<Shizuka> 13there's probably two people that got my reference
<CK|GW2> Dude must be a MASTER gamer.
<pony_364477> So... why cant I access the regular chat windows?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Jack Black? lol
<Cypresswolf> I still havent finished the full 100 S3 bingo thing...I shouldnt click
<Cypresswolf> made 72/100
<Malavolent> Still no season 3 date?
<Tovler> Well, I'm within walking distance of my voting. May as well.
<Biglaw> September 22
<Biglaw> that's the date
<Kandarihu> I read further. It's just a glitch.
<Shizuka> 13god i love brad dourif
<Biglaw> I believe
<Malk> Kandarihu romney got 15 states ron paul got 11
<Shizuka> 13such a great character actor
<Malavolent> Biglaw: Prove it.
<Kandarihu> Malk, where are you getting this?
<CK|GW2> Moar running
<Tovler> Chris Christie should have sat on the Obama chair yesterday.
<Tovler> ah, fat jokes
<Cypresswolf> Who am I kidding - I ran out of bingo spot ideas weeks ago
<Shizuka> 13GET A FIAH GOING
<Cypresswolf> You'll just have to make do with 72 :)
<Rex_Mundi> Oh hay, i can connect to the server now! What was going on?
<CK|GW2> ....The Hundred Acre Wood!
<Fl00tersh41> You can't just chop down random branches and use them to start a fire
<Fl00tersh41> You need dry tinder for a fire
<Ryunosuke> in middle earth, trees burn you
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Cypresswolf> Myaah, why cant we have someats
<Klumzeedragon> alexxm: That's good to hear.
<AJIsAwesome> Cannabalism? Huh.

<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: I couldn't either.
<Brad__> netsplit
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: What was with that I wonder?
<Klumzeedragon> Biglaw: :$ That was a fake tweet yesterday.
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Something to do with the internet,

<Ryunosuke> that leeeroy jenkins
<Biglaw> Klumzeedragon: nuuuu ;A;
<Fl00tersh41> What do you know. The cavalry really do come to the rescue
<AJIsAwesome> Biglaw: It sad HUBTVNETVVORK.
<Cypresswolf> The wrong way to Brohoof
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Fl00tersh41> One time has to the be first I guess
<AJIsAwesome> *said*
<Klumzeedragon> Biglaw: Yeah, sadly... So we are still without a date.
<CK|GW2> Rohan, home of the Middle Earth Equestrian Television Enthusiasts.

<Tovler> Will D-War: Dragon War be the Rifftrax version tonight?
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Ryunosuke> I just realized
<Ryunosuke> Logolas has a never-ending quiver of arrows
<MirrorImage> Ryunosuke - Plot Armor
<MirrorImage> err... Plot Equipment
<Xaiphafonese> dem elves are tricksy
<Fl00tersh41> Ryunosuke: He stole Rambo's ammo clip?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<AJIsAwesome> McDonald's.:D
<Shizuka> 13protip, viggo mortensen actually broke his foot in that shot, thus the scream
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol ouch
<alfopony> hello everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: How heavy was that helmet?
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Shizuka> 13that's also why it cuts so fast
<AJIsAwesome> alfopony: Hello!
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: Hello!
<Rex_Mundi> You know what would be weird, if there are horses in the ponyverse, but they are just normal horses that dont talk or anything... and ponies can ride them.
<Tovler> They used a real helmet? Its Brandon Lee all over again.
<Tovler> well, not quite
<Ryunosuke> that family circus tracking
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Ponies riding ponies?
<Klumzeedragon> alfopony and GilDash: Hallo! :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Rex_Mundi o_o wow that WOULD be weird
<alfopony> :$
<Brad__> Rex_Mundi, Im pretty sure ive seen ponies riding other ponies in a few episodes...
<Klumzeedragon> Shizuka: I did not know that! 6_9
<Tovler> Rex_Mundi: It wouldn't be any different than Goofy walking Pluto
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat Holy Grail reference
<CK|GW2> He is Brave Sir Robin, Brave Sir Robin~
<MirrorImage> looks like a Minecraft biome there
<RaveBrony> Sir Robin! :D
<MirrorImage> Lots of desert, then abrupt cut to Jungle
<Fl00tersh41> It's an impressive feat to follow those tracks
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<CK|GW2> Well, you know. Rangers are magical.
<Fl00tersh41> Considering all the horses that would also have galloped all over that place
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: There are various moments like that in these movies, like the knife thrown at Aragorn in the first movie was accidentally really thrown right at viggo and he really did deflect it with his sword. Also, Gandalf hitting his head in Bilbos house was an accident.
<Fl00tersh41> And the battle that was fought there
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, Durger, I think, drew Pinkie riding Horsified Pinkie in Paintchat once, the amount of lulz was immense

<Ryunosuke> halflings rarely wear shoes
<Fl00tersh41> And did they not see the endless bog lands before stepping in them?
<AJIsAwesome> If they're walking barefoot, that must really suck.

<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Hello!
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: That's the matter? :(
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: 3:20 here.
<CCCP> RaveBrony nothing its just life thats the problem
<Ryunosuke> Gandalf is the Elmisnter of Middle Earth
<RaveBrony> CCCP: How so?

<CCCP> RaveBrony it just is its not really worth it
<CCCP> hi Ryunosuke
<Rex_Mundi> clumpdoodle
<RaveBrony> CCCP: What happened? D:
<Ryunosuke> that old spice commercial
<RaveBrony> Dat voice
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: I wouldn't say that. I had the feeling as you do before for a LONG time, but that didn't stop me from enjoying life to the fullest.
<Rex_Mundi> its Celestias Cousin
<Klumzeedragon> Gandolf? Oh! You must be reffering to my old persona Gandalf the Grey! No, no, no. I'm GanDolf now.
<Vivix> Ganondolf
<CK|GW2> Best reference!
<RaveBrony> :D
<CCCP> its pretty hard to enjoy hell AJIsAwesome, thats all life is
*CK|GW2 can't stop laughing at their comments. XD
<Vordox> It's more STEEL the black
<Vordox> then*
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: That depends. What's going on in life for you?
<Vivix> He ran off-
<Vivix> Hope he get's better soon
<Rex_Mundi> dem Easterlings
<RaveBrony> :(
<CK|GW2> Vordox: But "The Steel Gate" doesn't really have that same ring to it
<Vordox> CK|GW2: Indeed not
<RaveBrony> Needs more Vuvuzela
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: Yeah, life is hard mate. But that's why you have great friends to help you through the tough times.
<Quick_Thinker> okay so since no pony used the beta code they won last week im going to give it away in a question arie so get ready for the question
<Vordox> Klumzeedragon: We do?
<CK|GW2> That seems like an impractically large gate.
<Klumzeedragon> Vordox: We're all friends here, no? :)
<Xaiphafonese> id like to think so
<Vivix> Well, as close as we can be
<Quick_Thinker> and it looks like a rock how?
<MirrorImage> Quick_Thinker - elven cloak?
<Xaiphafonese> hard water in the laundry
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<CK|GW2> Because magic
<Klumzeedragon> Quick_Thinker: It's a magically magic cloak of elven.
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah. We're all friends here.
<CK|GW2> And as we know, magic pretty much does whatever the writer says so
<Vivix> Magic is as magic does, or- what that saying goes
<Vivix> how*
<Quick_Thinker> cept it seems to backfire on Harry and twi
<Quick_Thinker> and ron
<Vivix> I like the magic in MLP, it seems very limited compared to other magic fictions
<Shizuka> 13vogue two three four
<Xaiphafonese> with harry, its cuz well.....yea. with twi its just funnier when it happens to the skilled
<WindWhistler> Aw man I'm gonna miss Rifftrax again?!
<Quick_Thinker> it is not limited they have fuckin time travel
<Tovler> Come on, Vogue
<WindWhistler> D:
*WindWhistler cries
<Quick_Thinker> just saying
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Same here. I like how they don't overuse it.
<WindWhistler> ALSO HI PEOPLE
<Rex_Mundi> There is a really awesome LOTR mode for Rome Total War Alexander, check t out.http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=1634
<Vivix> limited time travel, but look at how she can't use get out of jail free card with magic, and how little magic normal unicorns have
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: Hello. Why are you crying?
<Sergio_Scriptor> HELLO everyone :) how are you all doing today ? :P
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, yeah, it gives it an extra zing
<Quick_Thinker> they have powerful magic its just that they cant exactly use it cause they dont havve the skills to
<EspyLacopa> Cuddly as a what?
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Yeah. Well Twi is also just a student. xD
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: They use telekinesis and similar magic constantly
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: Because I have an appointment in half an hour. And Rifftrax is on the stream. D:
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Hello!
<Sergio_Scriptor> seeing riftrax i see :)
*Sergio_Scriptor waves at AJIsAwesome :)
*WindWhistler continues crying
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, yeah, normal unicorn magic, but like even what Trixie does seemed to impress the crowd, except the m6
<Ryunosuke> suddenly whitrun
<CK|GW2> XD
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: Hey there!
<Ryunosuke> *whterun
<Shizuka> 13jarl balgruuf really let himself go
<Sergio_Scriptor> Klumzeedragon: hey :)
<alfopony> skyrim ref
<Xaiphafonese> oh my i haddnt see tht till now...
<Quick_Thinker> no joke the magic is very powerful, but only special trained or inovative ponys like say Starswerled the bearded
<Quick_Thinker> can use it without killing themselves
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: Probably has more to do with Ponyville being an earth pony town
<Klumzeedragon> WindWhistler: *huggles* Nooooo crying! By the time you get back, it'll be movie time! And you can enjoy the movies with everypony!
<thelonepony> hai everypony :)
*Tovler googles Hansen
<Dark_Horst> the day i realized these guys are nord, i shat a little brick
<Quick_Thinker> tounge hug?
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Fl00tersh41 my viking friend :) how are you doing today ?
<Dark_Horst> i mean, LOOK A THEM!
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Hello!
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: Twilly is constantly using spells for everything
<Rex_Mundi> Most unicorns dont seem to know much magic other than some basic spells.
<WindWhistler> Klumzeedragon: But I wanna watch RiffTrax! D: *WHINES*
<Vivix> Maybe, but I like to think that the average unicorn can't do much more than that because they don't train for it. And that like- Starswirled and Twi are special- you know
<Fl00tersh41> Sergio_Scriptor: I'm good
<Dark_Horst> the architecture! the dude'S crown thing!
<Fl00tersh41> Sergio_Scriptor: You?
<Quick_Thinker> and all ponies know telekinsis
<Dark_Horst> Quick_Thinker: only unicorns
<Xaiphafonese> maybe ponyville lays on a layline tht interferes with heavy magic use....
<Klumzeedragon> thelonepony: Howdy!
<Quick_Thinker> okay so i made a mistake
<Quick_Thinker> a layline realy XD
<Vivix> I like that the magic is so downplayed, its not like fixes everything magic
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: good to,started to wonder recently that i need to find a cute nerdy girl to date :$ and have been very drepressed by not finding anyone :\
<Dark_Horst> if layline, EXPLAIN TWILIGHT
<Klumzeedragon> WindWhistler: Youtube it later? 6_9
<Fl00tersh41> Sergio_Scriptor: Can't help with that I'm afraid
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: I know that feeling.:(
<Quick_Thinker> vivix both times magic did fix shit (some pony had to have made the elments of harmony and if anything i think it was starswerl)
<WindWhistler> Klumzeedragon: RiffTrax isn't easy to find.
<WindWhistler> At least not free.
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: :'( someday ...
<Vivix> the elements predate Starswirl, as far as I've gathered-
<WindWhistler> Well now I have to go. D:
<Xaiphafonese> simple, night and day need a break from time to time so Twilight is the seventh inning stretch...
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Yep, someday.:(
<CK|GW2> Dat theme
<Tovler> isohunt has a ton of Rifftrax
<Quick_Thinker> okay so then some pony had to make it
<Ryunosuke> RIIIIIIIICOOOLAAAAA
<RaveBrony> Cya WindWhistler|AFK!
<Prince_Blueblood> isohunt sucks
<otakon17> So much medicine
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: Unicorns used to control the moon and the sun, seasons and such
<Prince_Blueblood> they got deballed years ago
<Quick_Thinker> also the love fighint those wierd love hating things
<Klumzeedragon> WindWhistler: We'll miss you!
<Tovler> iso looks pretty good to me
<Quick_Thinker> i dont mean the changelings
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: But that's all in unicorn cities where there are schools like Celestias for teaching Unicorns to use magic
<otakon17> Fishkipperer
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, yeah, in a huge group. What I'm saying is that I think it's cool that it's--not as overplayed and huge and dramatic as magic in other shows. They're simple unicorns and normal ponies, and what Twi can do alone is pretty amazing
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Agreed.
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: In a simple earth pony village I doubt you can get much formal training in magic
<Rex_Mundi> I wonder if there are other pony tribes besides the 3 that made equestria? maybe there are wild ponies that live in places like the everfree forest.
<Quick_Thinker> what training is there?
<Vivix> yeah, you'd probably have to travel out of the city to get schooling
<RaveBrony> pwnage
<otakon17> Playing the old man card
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Who knows?
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: Hence why ponyville locals don't use magic as much
<Vivix> Celestias school for gifted unicorns, and probably some other unmentioned ones
<Xaiphafonese> with always brings me back to why we havent seen Sweetie bell use magic
<Tovler> Mininova got "deballed" but isohunt is still good at least in the US
<Quick_Thinker> seriously the only ponies we know who were specified in magic are Twi and Star
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: i like to think that exist a race of ponies that live underground called the lanteans( latin to : exiled) :)
<AJIsAwesome> Xaiphafonese: Maybe she's supposed to be like Scootaloo.
<otakon17> Xaiphafonese: Shes not good at it
<Vivix> She's probably weak and young still, I like that she uses her mouth a lot
<otakon17> Yh
<Ryunosuke> Vivix, I am sure you do
<Vivix> even when Twilight started learning, she was weak, as in that cutie mark episode. I think it just makes it cooler
<Vivix> Ryunosuke, ;__;
<Fl00tersh41> Lack of formal training I suspect
<Quick_Thinker> and after like maybe 10 years she is stil weak
<Quick_Thinker> in a way
<Quick_Thinker> punch them out
<otakon17> Elf jiitsu
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Rex_Mundi> Cool fact. There are G1 ponies that have gews instead of eyes. And in a G1 comic it is explained that those ponies were once slaves whose eyes died and they replaced them with magic jewels so they can see again.
<otakon17> Hahahaha
<Vivix> yeah- so yeah, anything like Trixie or Twi are probably really cool to the average untrained or uninterested unicorn
<Quick_Thinker> waht
<Tovler> just like Sableye
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: Well thats kind of creepy
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: a little dark :\
<Vivix> Woah, that's pretty cool
<otakon17> I remember the gem eyed ponies
<Quick_Thinker> thats fuckin creepy for G1
<tSpark> Sup peeps! (And by peeps, I mean everypony)
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: that would be great for Creepypasta :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi tSpark :)
<pony_275904> hello
<Quick_Thinker> it probelt already is
<otakon17> Infested with Chtristopher Lees
<tSparx> There we go, now I'm the right handle :P
<otakon17> Lol
<pony_275904> how do i change my nickname?
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: But you'd likely find a lot more trained unicorns if you go to unicorn towns
<otakon17> pony_275904: Use /nick
<tSparx> /nick [name]
<Count-bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: Shout out
<Ryunosuke> ./nick [nick]
<Klumzeedragon> Fl00tersh41 and Vivix: And dont forget that Twilight can only do so much magic is because her special talent is magic~ Other Unicorns can only do Magic pertaining to their special skill. Like Rarity can really only look for gems and do fancy magics like trimming up the tree branches.
<pony_275904> thx\
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Count-bleck :P
<Fl00tersh41> The real difference between Trixie and Trilly is talent
<otakon17> He looks a lot better
<Fl00tersh41> Twilly is all books and learning
<tSparx> That was a crazy-fast recovery
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: so trixie is ntural talent ? :D
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: And friendship!
<Fl00tersh41> Trixie has learned by practice with none of the theory
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: And badass magic!
<otakon17> Klumzeedragon: Also, unicorns all know the basic levitation spell/telekinesis basically
<Quick_Thinker> so how is the magic abilities like say cutting branchs limited to that learn some other ways to use that skill creatively
<Vivix> Klumzeedragon, true, and Trixie's cutiemark seems to be illusion or show-spells, Magic should be limited for normal ponies, and- I think you'd find more talented ponies in those schools, that might also have multi-talent cutiemarks or marks relating to magic
<pony_8435> jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa :[
<Count-bleck> Sergio_Scriptor I simply don't like LOTR, I'll be back later
<otakon17> Dat innuendo
<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-bleck: ok :P
<Klumzeedragon> otakon17: Aye. I didnt think I'd have to say that though. xD
<Vivix> notice my horrible commas
<otakon17> Bye Count-bleck
<RaveBrony> Sky Mall :D
<RaveBrony> Gotta love it
<Quick_Thinker> everypony to the SKY MALL
<Vivix> Trixie might have been unschooled, but we don't really know
<Shizuka> 13let him go he needs to hurry up and get to tomahna to steal a book
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: well we will just have to wait to see maybe more magic shcools in the future :P
<Fl00tersh41> Klumzeedragon: If unicorns can't learn by reading spellbooks why are there whole libaries full of spellbooks?
<pony_8435> i am new :)
<tSparx> In my head-canon, earth-ponies have another as-yet undiscovered kind of magic.
<Vivix> yeah
<Rex_Mundi> Yeah, G1 had its dark moments... something that they wont allow in todays shows.
<otakon17> Shizuka: What?
<RaveBrony> Welcome, pony_8435 :)
<Shizuka> 13guess nopony gets the reference .-.
<Fl00tersh41> Klumzeedragon: And schools for teaching magic
<Cypresswolf> Myst 3 Exile
<Vivix> I think all ponies are said to have inate magic to their tribe
<Shizuka> 13except cypress
<Buytoast> you head canon means diddly shit
<otakon17> Fl00tersh41: Spells created by other ponies
<otakon17> Shizuka: Sorry dear enope
<tSparx> Like, it's not even the same *kind* of magic as unicorns use. Sorta like the difference between mages and druids in WoW
<Ryunosuke> where's waldo
<Sergio_Scriptor> then welcome to sunny bronystate pony_8435 be sure to buy our anti-buffer spray on the gift shop :P
<Shizuka> 13uncultured filly
<Quick_Thinker> Rex your forgetting the Lesson zero mental breakdown and the Wedding going bat shit crazy
<Klumzeedragon> Fl00tersh41: For those ponies with the gift of magic. Hence why they have such a strict entrance exam. ;)
<Quick_Thinker> thats pretty damn dark
<Fl00tersh41> otakon17: But any unicorn could learn magic that way, or there would be no point in the spell books
<Vivix> Several ponies probably have cutiemarks relating to magic
<Cypresswolf> speaking of, I havent been on Uru live in a few weeks...I'll have some time on sunday, Shizu :)
<Vivix> I don't think Twi is the only scholar
<Eulshy> meowmeowemew
<Shizuka> 13have not really touched it since either
<Quick_Thinker> like how we are going into indepth discussion based on magic that is explained in a small way
<otakon17> Lol
<soulrider95> Who says all unicorns have magic? Have you ever seen all the background unicorns using magic?
<Vivix> It's the way of nerdism
<tSparx> Vivix Well it'd be silly to have an enterance exam for a field that only one pony is in :P
<otakon17> Quick_Thinker: Always happens, fandom looks deep into its source
<Klumzeedragon> pony_8435: Welcome!
<Quick_Thinker> soulrider they are background ponys for a reason
<Sergio_Scriptor> soulrider95: well they are unicorns,it's like a pegasus never flying :D
<WallDives> hello all.
<Fl00tersh41> soulrider95: The numerous remarks to general unicorn magic made by Twilly?
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi WallDives :)
<Quick_Thinker> they are there to stand there not pull hadokens and other crazy shit
<Xaiphafonese> if i may reference "magic kindergarden"
<Vivix> tSparx, that it would hee. And yeah, some unicorns are probably weaker, some stronger, some might not use magic a lot due to habit, just like people
<AJIsAwesome> I don't want to bring up another war, but i honestly like Celestia. Even though she isn't one of the most powerful Alicorns in Equestria in terms of magic, she is in terms of political stability. Sure, she likes to make jokes and have fun, but that makes her character more defined. She wants to have a little bit of fun everyone once in a while, and I don't blame her. Also, for people who say that she was being a troll when she didn't give Twilight
<soulrider95> wall text
<AJIsAwesome> WallDives: Hello!
<Tovler> mm, horse stew
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry. Wall text.
<Shizuka> 13biiiiiiiill
<tSparx> Vivix: Yeah, agreed.
<AJIsAwesome> :$
<WallDives> AJIsAwesome, I like Tia for the same reasons...
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, I completely agree
<Vivix> your end cut off though
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: indeed :)
<otakon17> AJIsAwesome: Pretty sure she is the most powerful Alicorn, well normally
<Quick_Thinker> okay so where are the other Alicorns all we know is Crysalis and Luna so far
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Who says that Celestia isn't among the most magically powerful alicorns? She *raises the sun* everyday
<Vivix> I think she is crazy powerful, but that so are other beings like her
<Shizuka> 13everyone knows luna is best
<AJIsAwesome> I really don't like it when people say that they hate her when they don't give valid reasons.
<otakon17> Only reason Chrysalis won that one match was from stolen love
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony
<otakon17> Shizuka: Goes withou saying
<Chrysalis> Oi!
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: THANK YOU!
<Franek12354> Shizuka:Best answer as now
<Chrysalis> i be all powerful
<Vivix> stolen love and probably inate queen stuff
<Xaiphafonese> i agree with AjIsAwesome, to some degree
<Chrysalis> they cheated through cliche
<otakon17> Yh
<Rex_Mundi> No, an OC Alicorn that is all Black and red and Evil is best Alicorn6_9
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: Celestia is the worf of Equestria
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: -_-
<Vivix> woorf..star trek?
<Fl00tersh41> She gets beaten by any threat that comes along
<tSparx> Also, is Crysalis even really an Alicorn? The changelings aren't even ponies, are they?
<otakon17> Fl00tersh41: Lol
<Vivix> hehehe
<WallDives> Rex_Mundi, also cliche and blatantly Sueish.
<Eulshy> Rex_Mundi, your OC is not best pony
<Fl00tersh41> To show it's dangerous
<Sergio_Scriptor> So do you guys think that exist more planets on the equestrian solar system,and if so is there alicorns to represent them ? and would they be more powerfull ? :|
<Xaiphafonese> ouch
<Quick_Thinker> i mean there a probely some other alicorns far from the current lands of Equestria (like say go further then the edge of the map saying dragons be here)
<otakon17> tSparx: Well they are pony like
<Vivix> Chrysalis isn't considered an alicorn unless you go by fanon, I think
<WallDives> tSparx, I wouldnt say they are ponies...
<Rex_Mundi> WallDives: yep!:P
<WallDives> or even equine.
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: She's the superman of Equestria; she needs to be weakened by something so that the other characters can solve problems instead
<otakon17> Shes not an alicorn
<Vivix> but all we know about Changelings are from that one episode, and it's-- probably likely that they are not equines
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry for the wall text. I just don't like it when people hate things without giving an in-depth analysis.:$
<otakon17> So
<Quick_Thinker> its hard not to say something S3 related
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: no problem :P
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Good question.
<Tovler> I wish I could type that fast.
<Quick_Thinker> REALLY REALLY HARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Eulshy> your arguments seems fairly out of cannon so i dont care
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: I would also question how much solid practice Celestia has at actually fighting
<Rex_Mundi> My theory is that Celestia and luna are special by Alicorn standards, but other lesser Alicorns exist, like Cadance.
<otakon17> The changelings just look like equines
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: That's my headcanon too
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, yyes, it is probably a very long time since there was a war
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: Well you might be on to something
<Sergio_Scriptor> otakon17: i would say they are hibrids :\
<AJIsAwesome> I kind of wish to see Celestia and Luna's parents, though.
<Quick_Thinker> wiat is blueblood a alicorn?
<Klumzeedragon> And the chat exploded. :D I can't keep up with everypony anymore.
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Wait, Cadence has wings?
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: No wings.
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, yeah, in my personal belief Cadence is a winged unicorn, or a watered out normal alicorn, because she ages in Twilights flashbacks
<Prince_Blueblood> no
<teentro> LOTR :D
<Prince_Blueblood> but I have unicorn magic
<otakon17> Beat cheeks Shadowfax! BEST CHEEKS!
<teentro> hey everyone ^^
<Sergio_Scriptor> Quick_Thinker: GOD NO :|
<Ryunosuke> blueblood is a unicorn
<WallDives> just saying, a powered-up Chrysilis isnt a good standard for Celestia's fighting prowess.
<Cavale> hello everypony
<Prince_Blueblood> so I can escape from people trying to nibble on me
<WallDives> hi Cavale.
<AJIsAwesome> Cadence may be an Alicorn, but she's not immortal.
<Shizuka> 13so otakon17 you were checking out shadowfax's plot?
<tSparx> I totally missed that.
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Cavale :)
<Shizuka> 13"best cheeks"?
<Quick_Thinker> but i thought blueblood was cadences brother
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: That
<AJIsAwesome> Cavale: Hello!
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, yeah, I think so
<Prince_Blueblood> no
<otakon17> Yes he is
<otakon17> Hiya Cavale
<otakon17> WallDives: Agreed
<Quick_Thinker> DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<Prince_Blueblood> blueblood is a 'relative'
<Vivix> Who Blueblood is related to isn't said in the show, so we don't know
<Prince_Blueblood> he was originally going to be 'duke blueblood'
<otakon17> Shizuka: No no, beat cheeks!
<Buytoast> oh boy, people discussing the powers and skills of cartoon ponies
<pony_8435> jaaaaaaaaaaaaa :[
<Ryunosuke> blueblood is prince by marriage perhaps?
<Rex_Mundi> Quick_Thinker: Dun Dun Dunland!
<Shizuka> 13but you said best
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: For all we know, Celestia and Luna's long levity is a simple magical trick
<Cavale> blueblood ewww must you speak that name
<otakon17> Eeyup Buytoast thats what fans do
<Prince_Blueblood> Buytoast, welcome to the bronydom?
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Yep. It's inescapable.:)
<Vivix> We're the new trekkies
<RaveBrony> :D
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Pretty sure they say Blueblood is Celestia's nephew.
<Vivix> We will discuss unicorn magic the way they discuss space engines!
<Buytoast> here's a thought
<otakon17> Shizuka: The second time...:P a typo
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: i prefer to belive they live the same as the sun and the moon age respective :)
<Buytoast> they're only as powerful as the episode dictates
<Vivix> They do--don't they? Hm
<Buytoast> WOAH
<Prince_Blueblood> star trek was awesome
<Shizuka> 13uh huh suuuuuure
<Buytoast> it's mindblowing, aint it
<Prince_Blueblood> and so are ponies
<Quick_Thinker> Buytoast you no like then just leave makes it less annnoying in this room
<Prince_Blueblood> which is why Q came over
<OneTrickPony> hai everyone
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: No, remember, the mane6 are all shocked to discover that Celestia is Luna's sister, even T-Sparx the magic scholar
<otakon17> Shizuka: I do not like plot!
<Brad__> lol watching cutie mark chronicles episode... pinkie's rock farm makes me lol so much.
<Shizuka> 13uh huh
<Shizuka> 13suuuuuure
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: Doesn't seem like it'd be a *simple* magic trick, at least.
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Tell that to Sonic fans.
<Buytoast> bullshit
<Tovler> I died when Kevin said "crispity crunchity Anatevka"
<Prince_Blueblood> I've never understood sonic fans
<Buytoast> you can't tell anything to sonic fans
<Prince_Blueblood> but they probably don't understand me
<otakon17> Shizuka: Dammit you're enjoying this too much.
<Vivix> hm
<Vivix> tSparx, true, so Luna was probably more or less forgotten,
<Rex_Mundi> The Sonic fandom... boy has the sonic fandom sunck
<AJIsAwesome> OneTrickPony: Hello!
<Vivix> What did they say in pilot intro? They did say 'sister' right?
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Agreed.:S
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: Remember, we could be like that one day
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: WHAT THE FUC IS A SONIC ?!-jontron reference
<tSparx> Vivix: Well what I'm saying is that it seems to suggest that no one realized Celestia was *that* old, that was my take on it when I saw the pilot anyway
<pony_8435> im from denmark :S
<Klumzeedragon> OneTrickPony: Hello Minecraft friend!
<Quick_Thinker> the fandom does suck most of the time but i heard the fans are working on the old sonic cartoon fan episode (the one with sally)
<Vivix> tSparx, oh hey- yeah..hm
<Fl00tersh41> tSparx: Luna was probably just forgoten due to power politics
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: As long as we are careful.
*Tovler tries to say "Anatevka Anatevka, crispity crunchity Anatevka with a straight face"
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: We'l be fine.
<AJIsAwesome> *We'll*
<OneTrickPony> hiya Klumzeedragon
<otakon17> pony_8435: Welcome! Change your nick with /nick
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: I think she was forgotten because she'd been locked up 10,000 years ago.
<Vivix> hehe
*otakon17 /nick like this
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Who?
<otakon17> tSparx: 1000
<Ryunosuke> tSparx, 1000 years?
<Vivix> She was probably forgotten, replaced with a myth, and gone the way of many old things
<Quick_Thinker> im going to take a guess at a S3 episode is that fine with the admins?
<Vivix> how when 1000 years passed, even historical characteres begin to feel like fiction
<Fl00tersh41> tSparx: Celestia needed to consolidate power with herself, which is easiest is everyone isn't constantly asking where her co ruler is
<otakon17> What Vivix said
<Shizuka> 13schizophrenia could strike at any time
<tSparx> Oh was it a thousand?
<Shizuka> 13make sure you're immunized
<Quick_Thinker> im going to take a guess at a S3 episode is that fine with the admins?
<Vivix> tSparx, yeah one thousand
<Rex_Mundi> Quick_Thinker: I think that there are multple sonic fandoms, because sonic has different canons. The magazines, the games, the shows... Not all of them are so low.
<Klumzeedragon> Immunized I am!
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: still why did her sister encourged the myth,and not just say the truth ? :\
<Eulshy> Quick_Thinker no
<otakon17> Shizuka: But you can't immunize against that...
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Agreed.
<Shizuka> 13i used to have schizophrenia but we're okay now
<WallDives> XD
<Quick_Thinker> Eulshy your not an admin
<tSparx> Shizuka: :D
<Vivix> Sergio_Scriptor, not sure, she might not have, she might have just let the mortals do what they want, she seems to have done that a few times
<pony_8435> arhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh :[
<Brad__> " Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban"
<Vordox> inb4 Meet the Shizu
<Xaiphafonese> ive been going Schizo for awhile i think.....get your shots now!
<otakon17> Sergio_Scriptor: Bc she didn't realize how much ponies still thought of her as nMM
<Eulshy> Quick_Thinker, regardless say nothing about s3 guess or otherwise
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Because Twilight would have been focused on defeating Nightmare Moon than making friends.
<Vivix> that might be true too otakon17
<Quick_Thinker> Brad its a GUESS not stright up spoilers
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: maybe she is not as powefull as she looks like then,if you folow that logic then :\
<Brad__> Just quoting the topic.
<tSparx> Quick_Thinker: Yeah, but Eulshy can read the topic of the channel. NO S3 convo
<Shizuka> 13gollum stop talking to the audience, we want to watch the movie
<Ryunosuke> "Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban."
<otakon17> :_:
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker I think it's fine as long as you base none of it from known S3 material out
*WallDives sighs.
<Vivix> Maaybe- but I'm thinking Celestia might at times hold back information or pull back, because medling is something she is done with
<EonMaster> Gollum is such a tragic character
<tSparx> EonMaster: Word
<otakon17> Yes
<WallDives> in other news, otakon17, I dont see you getting kicked every 10 minutes.
<Rex_Mundi> I would kinda like to see a G3 Tirak. Get some more dark phantasy elements in the show and a little less 'slice of life' based episodes
<Quick_Thinker> fuck it im asking an actual admin
<Vivix> she might have been content with waiting for her sister, and--I don't know, it's hard to say when we don't see it in the show
<otakon17> WallDives: On iPod
<Cypresswolf> But...smeagol the movie isnt over - we dont leave til the credits start
<otakon17> WallDives: Can't type that fast with thimbs
<WallDives> Quick_Thinker, but none of them are admins, they're chanops...
<otakon17> Thumbs... Dammit
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: If she had been told that Nightmare Moon was coming back, she would have been focusing her attention on just nightmare Moon, not building a connection with her friends. Therefore, failing the mission.
*WallDives snickers.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: so either she is not that powefull to actualy control stories and myths,or she has everything planned,everything that will ever happen she knows it :|
<CrimsonPhoenix> Brad making a guess on S3 will start a discussion
<Ryunosuke> I am just sticking to the MOTD, w are frwoning upon S3 discussions, spoilers, guesses, or otherwise
<MakerDusk> Quick_Thinker: what would you like to ask an admin?
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: true :\
<Cypresswolf> Boil em. Mash em. Stick em in a stew
<Quick_Thinker> that if i can take a guess on a S3 episode
<Fl00tersh41> Sergio_Scriptor: She doesn't need to control everything, just what goes into the history books
<Vivix> Sergio_Scriptor, that might be, we don't reallyy know, but from her general attitude, Celestia might be very witihdrawn at times-
<otakon17> Campbells chunky cream of cronies
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Just saying. I'm not trying to force anything on you.
<Quick_Thinker> or hell maybe a S4 or S5
<Cavale> love that line stupid fat hobit
<otakon17> Taters! Whats taters?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Quick_Thinker, just don't say it?
<Shizuka> 13bet none of you saw that coming
<EspyLacopa> singit!
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: Potatoes?
<Ryunosuke> that ... waht
<otakon17> PO TAT TO's
<RaveBrony> LOL
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: no problem :)
<Xaiphafonese> hippster Sam GO!
<pony_8435> hahaha :D
<tSparx> Shizuka: Nope nope :P
<Cypresswolf> unz unz unz
<p4ngya> beatnoxing :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause sharing it in here will lead to response that will lead to discussion
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, I think that's why she never told Twilight the truth, or the truth to anyone in general, which might- be why she never said NMM is my sister Luna
<otakon17> Raw wriggling
<Klumzeedragon> I saw it coming from a mile away Shizuka! :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that's forbided
<Vivix> it was just so long ago that it might not helpful?
<otakon17> Ewwww
<MakerDusk> Quick_Thinker: you're looking for a bronystate mod then... admins are something else entierly
<Cypresswolf> mmmm Juicey! ^_^
<Tovler> Where.in.the.world.is. Carmen Sandiego?
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Agreed.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: it's something only time will say to us :P we still know very few about equestria history,time will tell :)
<Quick_Thinker> fine i see your point
<tSparx> Shizuka: Please answer WallDives so that we can move on with our live
<Vivix> yeah
<MakerDusk> Quick_Thinker: we're much scarier
<WallDives> I didnt ask a question, tSparx.
<Vivix> I mean the Christmas episode was a huge lore opener
<pony_8435> omg :'(
<alexxm> ninjas
<Quick_Thinker> and all i wanted to do was make a guess :l
<AJIsAwesome> pony_8435: What's wrong?
<tSparx> Mi culpa I meant Qckthnkr
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: yeah,but i bet there is still like many more pony races arround :P
<Rex_Mundi> So does most everypony in the ponyverse know that Luna was NMM? It seems to me that the mane6 arnt that well know and thus I dont think people know that the mane 6 defeated her.
<otakon17> Vivix: Didn't explain The Royal Pony Sisters origins
<otakon17> Oliphant
<CrimsonPhoenix> Quick_Thinker, but you already did it
<CrimsonPhoenix> in your head
<CrimsonPhoenix> but you want to share it
<Vivix> No it did not explain the origin, but it hinted at possible origins that we might use in fanon
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that'll lead to discussion
<Fl00tersh41> Rex_Mundi: She's the co ruler of the country
*Quick_Thinker bans himself from his mind
<EspyLacopa> Carmen Sandiego x Waldo :: Gives birth to the Uchiha Clan of the naruto series.
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: There's a big stainglass window in Celestia's castle, and there was a major party in PonyVille after they did it
<WallDives> LadyCanary|wubwub, hello.
<LadyCanary|wubwub> :3 Is Shizu streaming?
<RaveBrony> Hehe
<alexxm> the elephants betrayed them
<Shizuka> 13canary canary <3
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Hiya WallDives
<Quick_Thinker> i like toy firetucks
<LadyCanary|wubwub> SHIZU!!!
<Fl00tersh41> Rex_Mundi: It's got to make headlines when she just comes out of nowhere
<Shizuka> 13wubwub
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, it doesn't seem that ponies in general knew that NMM was real, and might not have ever made the connection that NMM = Luna, that that is something only the m6 know, but not being secrets
<Tovler> clefairy clefairy <3
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, LadyCanary|wubwub.:)
<alexxm> ded
<Tovler> (I'm just reacting to things I see and hear)
<Eulshy> Loot him!
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: They probably hushed it up
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: And just said the Mane6 defeated NmM and luna returned as a elresult
<otakon17> Des chat?
<Vivix> I think M6 might be well known outside of Ponyville, and that Ponyville is used to them, maybe, stain glass and party and all that
<tSparx> Eh?
<Klumzeedragon> Rex_Mundi: But did they not get a giant stained glass window and also have a ceremony in their honour for defeating both NMM and Discord? I just think that they're very modest and dont let the town treat them so special.
<RaveBrony> :o
<alexxm> it begins
<tSparx> Where'd my LotR go!?
<Quick_Thinker> huh
<Sergio_Scriptor> ?
<EspyLacopa> Where movie go?!
<Sergio_Scriptor> :D
<Franek12354> INTERMISSION!
<EspyLacopa> Bring back da movie!
<Eulshy> WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: But how many ponies see the stained glass window. Plus the party could have just been a welcome back for Luna coming back, maybe ponies diddnt know that Luna was NMM.
<Vivix> Klumzeedragon, yeah, I think so too
<AJIsAwesome> Klumzeedragon: Agreed.
<Eulshy> WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
<RaveBrony> Intermission :P
<Quick_Thinker> time to play some ARMA
<Eulshy> WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
<otakon17> Hiya Dken2021, GigabitHarmonie, LadyCanary|wubwub wub wun
<Quick_Thinker> FUCK YOU AI
<Sergio_Scriptor> Mini-intermission :D
<Quick_Thinker> ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGg
<otakon17> Damn my chat
<GigabitHarmonie> Hello otakon17!
<Brad__> Id like to see an episode with pinkie in the city.
<Franek12354> My favorite
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: When Rarity wanted to be famous in canterlot she didn't simply mention who she was
<Dken2021> ohello otakon17
<otakon17> My chat is going nuts
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: THat seems less likely, because then the halloween ep, so many people didn't sem to realize Luna was back
<Sergio_Scriptor> Brad__: that would be AWESOME :)
<AJIsAwesome> Seriously, is that a sign Rarity was carrying?
<EspyLacopa> Scout vs Witch?
<otakon17> Lol
*Quick_Thinker gets shot out of plane and curses the AI and his team mates for leaving him to die
<Brad__> Sergio_Scriptor, :D
<Vivix> in the nightmare episode we see most ponies react to Luna with fear, but that might be a reaction to NMM having been there the year before
<otakon17> This is gonna be good
<Eulshy> scout vs witch
<alexxm> how've you been otakon17
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Sharakan> well im out
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Dat baseball.
<otakon17> alexxm: Okay
<EonMaster> ths'll be good
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: And that was after the second time they saved the country
<otakon17> Hiys xmasmare
<Sergio_Scriptor> ?
<EspyLacopa> Fluttershy, he's talking to you.
<xmasmare> hey otakon17
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, GigabitHarmonie.:)
<otakon17> Bonk!
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: The mane6 just ain't getting any fame for that
<Vordox> Tihs again
<Eulshy> scout outruns zombies
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, that I think is a sign that Rarity has esteem issues, she mentions RD being the Trainer of Wonderbolts, but not that she lives with the princess (until mentioning it hurridly later) and not really taking pride in herself
<GigabitHarmonie> Hello AJIsAwesome!
<LadyCanary|wubwub> SUP BITCHES ITS THE SCOUT
<Silverscreen> 1,11Good afternoon.
<Tovler> Is this that new Wii U game?
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, as if she doesn't recognize her own fame and worth
<otakon17> Lol
<tSparx> The Mane6 seem like they should be well known because they should be. Plot device, peeps.
<RaveBrony> Hey Silverscreen :P
<AJIsAwesome> GigabitHarmonie: You still taking the Bronystate question of the week?
<alfopony> ftw
<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: Hello!
<Eulshy> lol
<otakon17> If only
<thelonepony> Scout!!
<alexxm> how you doing Silverscreen
<Tovler> o, ok
<Sergio_Scriptor> oh YEAAAAAH
<AJIsAwesome> Tovler: SFM.
<GigabitHarmonie> AJIsAwesome: Until the show, yes, so send it in!
<otakon17> This is great
<Eulshy> dem shoes
<Silverscreen> 1,11I'm alright. Sorry to suddenly bring this up, but I won't be here for this week's BMN.
<Klumzeedragon> Left for Dead meats Team Fortress 2?
<otakon17> Fund it
<AJIsAwesome> GigabitHarmonie: Got it, thank you!:)
<alfopony> lol
<GigabitHarmonie> Silverscreen: :(
<otakon17> Lol
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: She could still have mentioned the whole "saved the country twice" thing at some point in that episode, but she never did
<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: WHAT?!:O
<alexxm> how come Silverscreen
<Sergio_Scriptor> SO much epic :$
<alfopony> im batan
<otakon17> Silverscreen: That sucks man
<otakon17> Shizuka: This is hilarious
<tSparx> The banshee talks?
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: Well, she would have amassed more fame than she realy needed.
<alfopony> im batman
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, she could have, but like the Princess, it seems like she did not think it was... impressive, since it was her. You know? Some peple are like that, they can't see their own worth so they make up things instead
<Silverscreen> 1,11Heading home for Labor Day Weekend. Won't be back until Monday night.
<Klumzeedragon> Silverscreen: I don't know you, but that doesn't sound good. We'll miss you!
<Eulshy> this is gunna be good
<otakon17> tSparx: Line from Army of Darkness
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Bonk.
<Vivix> how fameous they actually are is a bit hard to say too
<otakon17> Damn FUND THIS!
<EspyLacopa> This looks very well made.
<EspyLacopa> Bravo.
<alfopony> headshot
<EonMaster> I see Scout is taking the 300 approach to fighting
<otakon17> EspyLacopa: SFM
<CrimsonPhoenix> dang this is awesome
<LadyCanary|wubwub> So goood. OH GOD NO NOT THOSE
<AJIsAwesome> Aren't you going to grab your bat, Scout?
<GigabitHarmonie> Headcrab zombie!
<otakon17> Lol
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: none of the mane 6 are getting any fame for saving the country
<Sergio_Scriptor> :D
<alfopony> lol
<Eulshy> da fuq
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Goddamn...headcrabs D8
<tSparx> I think Derpy just keeps losing the newspapers, and that's why they aren't known outside Ponyville :P
<Quick_Thinker> tiuchdown
<otakon17> Hahahahahahahahaha /D
<CrimsonPhoenix> a bit too much slo-mo though
<Alchemist> whats this? Oldboy parody?
<RaveBrony> Oh wow :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: i blame the terrible equestria media :|
<Fl00tersh41> Vivix: my guess is that it's simply not a big deal
<tSparx> Good ol Headcrab-Zombies!
<Vivix> Well the stain glass gives them some fame, but how well known that is outside of the palace, we haven't been shown
<CrimsonPhoenix> still good nonetheless
<Eulshy> die hunter
<Quick_Thinker> wait that sounds like its from the star was sound effeccts
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Batter up!
<Fl00tersh41> Sergio_Scriptor: That would be Celestia's fault
<thelonepony> what this Sfm call?
<Fl00tersh41> She's the ruler after all
<alfopony> lik a boss
<otakon17> Lol
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, possibly, yeah. We don't know how far Discord had reached before he was stopped, for instance- but that was a bigger known thing than NMM
<alexxm> hax
<Quick_Thinker> HOME RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<Eulshy> like a ball
<Dken2021> I think Scout vs Witch
<alexxm> i'm calling hax
<otakon17> thelonepony: Scout vs. Witch
<otakon17> I am so faving this
<Dken2021> at least from what the infobar says
<Sergio_Scriptor> :)
<thelonepony> the Gnome
<Shizuka> 13it's not on youtube
<otakon17> Dream
<thelonepony> was in the backround
<Quick_Thinker> xd
<Rex_Mundi> See, i dont thnk most ponies know what really happened and dont know the mane 6 did anything. Nightmare moon showed up, then she vanished and luna returned and there was a party for that. Thats what most ponies know i think. Maybe they are afraid that nightmare moon and luna are the same thing and that they shouldnt piss her off or shell go evil on them again/
<Iain> Hi
<Vordox> Shizuka: You sure?
<Xaiphafonese> Fl00tersh41, it may be because the Equestrian state is comunist and service that saves the nation is expected
<otakon17> Shizuka: Dammit!
<Eulshy> Awesome dream
<otakon17> Dat dream
<LadyCanary|wubwub> BAHAHAHAHHA
<Shizuka> 13Vordox: vimeo or direct download only, the guy says youtube screwed up audio sync
<otakon17> Crap
<Iain> Hio everypony
<Vordox> Ah

<Fl00tersh41> Xaiphafonese: Or the entire country is full of ungrateful wretches
<AJIsAwesome> Iain: Hello!
<otakon17> Great ending too
<Dken2021> oh, reasonable, youtube kinda does mess up some videos
<Quick_Thinker> all of my yeses thrown at the screen
<Klumzeedragon> Iain: Hey there!
<EspyLacopa> Where's part two?!
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, yeah, that sounds plausible. I think the reason they were so terrified of Luna, was her grown size, and NMM still being fresh in memory for Ponyville, plus how they are not familiar with that princess
<otakon17> EspyLacopa: Not made yet
<Vivix> Plus, Luna does come across as a bit scary
<Eulshy> WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
<Dken2021> ello Iain
<LadyCanary|wubwub> And railings.
<Xaiphafonese> Fl00tersh41...or tht
<AJIsAwesome> Seriously, is that a sign Rarity was carrying?
<Iain> It's been awhile since I've been here
<Quick_Thinker> must construct well PAY ME THEN BITCH
<EspyLacopa> AJIsAwesome: No, it's more railings.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: A railing
<Klumzeedragon> Shizuka: Oh my the ending Dun dun dun's remind me of the weird Celestia face from Ponies the Anthology.
<AJIsAwesome> Ok.

<Rex_Mundi> What i want to know, what exactly happened to let NMM escape? Did Celestia do it so the mane6 can use the elements on her to turn her back to good? Or did NMM escape on her own? Or did something ells release her?
<Iain> i wanna dream with spitfire
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> I liek bundt cake
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: It was the planets alligning.
<DrSteveSCARz> Hai everypony :)
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, the curse/banishment might ahve been set as temporary- but the lore says "the stars will aid in her escape" but who or what controls that-
<EspyLacopa> I thought it was the stars aligning?
<Shizuka> 13zzzz
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: probably something else,if you remeber the 6 stars ? probably other ponies with other elements
<Iain> is this abridged
<tSparx> I'm gonna skip out on BMN; don't like the movies, and it's too much chat.
<Shizuka> 13not sure which is worse, this scene, or the entirety of star wars episode 2
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Now...KISS
<Sergio_Scriptor> Iain: it's riftrax so yeah...you can call it that :P
<Iain> :D
<Shizuka> 13hear hear bill
<Xaiphafonese> SW episode 1
<Quick_Thinker> pimp shirt powers activate
<tSparx> It says "The Stars will aid in her escape," but they never explain what that means
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: Or stars. :D But she was able to use them as a bridge back.
<Iain> so how do guys think of season 3 coming up?
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, it is possible- that Celestia had a hoof in it when they say the stars will aid in her escape, she definitely seems to know that it was going to happen then
<otakon17> Dammit not there
<Yahooz> ah more riftrax?
<tSparx> Iain: I'm not allowed to think about it on this channel.
<Quick_Thinker> Iain no discussing S3 apparntly
<Sergio_Scriptor> Klumzeedragon: i bet it was gannon and the seven mages :P
<Iain> okay
<tSparx> Iain: Not out loud anyway :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Celestia is a mastermind
<Shizuka> 13we have a strict no spoilers policy
<Sergio_Scriptor> *ganon
<Shizuka> 13even speculative
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: It all make sense now! Damn that Ryu!
<Quick_Thinker> oh now you tell me
<Quick_Thinker> funny Shizu
<Shizuka> 13enough people don't want to be spoiled about details
<otakon17> But
<otakon17> Speculation is awesome
<tSparx> She says that she *saw* the signs of NMM's return, not that she did it. But, y'know, tollestia and all
<CrimsonPhoenix> she place her pieces strategically so she won't need to be directly involved
<Rex_Mundi> Celestia is such a chessmaster if you pay attention to everything she does. such a master manipulater. I bet she could pull off zanatos gambits.
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: Thanatos
<WallDives> Xanatos^
<Iain> trollestia
<Yahooz> Season 3 is kind of like the forbidden topic for now
<tSparx> otakon17: Speculation can lead to false rumours, or people thinking they've been spoiled and getting upset about it
<Quick_Thinker> master manipulter exactly HOW
<Klumzeedragon> Rauru**
<Iain> :D troll jumping out!
<Shizuka> 13false rumors make for trouble
<Tovler> Doesn't want Season 3 spoilers. Hangs out with bronies several hours a day.
<otakon17> Bye lain
<Rex_Mundi> otakon17: no, Xanatos
<Shizuka> 13just look at EQD posting a fake tweet yesterday
<Vivix> hehe
<Iain> bye
<Sergio_Scriptor> Yahooz: it's like talkign about the book of judas in any church in the medieval ages :|
<tSparx> lawl at the EQD event
<Iain> elf
<Vivix> tSparx, she said that specifically?
<tSparx> lawl at the elf
<Shizuka> 13EQD is what happens when you don't crack down on spoilers
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Do you still have the screencap?:D
<Yahooz> Ooooh its mr theyre takin the hobbits to Izengard
<Buytoast> EQD is what happens when you let a trixie obsessed dragon fucker have power
<Iain> Dont let the pig kill people
<Dken2021> would EQD be the Kotaku of news?
<Shizuka> 13a scout? CALL THE WITCH!
<tSparx> Vivix: Celestia said that, "I saw the signs of NMM's return," when she exlains to T-Sparx what she's doing at the battle-site
<Klumzeedragon> AJIsAwesome: I thought it was Sumica who had the screencap.
<Vivix> Mmm- yes!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh gawd Buytoast that's going a bit far, even though it's true
*Tovler takes less classes at school to run a MLP blog.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Buytoast: poor seth :D
<alfopony> that looks nothing like skyrim orcs
<Vivix> That might mean that it was the elements that had limited the banishment, but it might still mean that Celestia had set the time somehow, but the former is much cooler and sadder
<otakon17> alfopony: Different fiction
<EspyLacopa> SQUIRREL!
<Iain> I saw the actaul movie
<Cypresswolf> Go Eowyn, show they people the meaning of haste
<Iain> MEDIC!
<Dken2021> how deadly is Legolas with that bow?
<CrimsonPhoenix> serious question
<Cypresswolf> HAX!
<Rex_Mundi> Quick_Thinker: Well, she sent twilight to Ponyville to make friends, the town where all the ponies whose cutie marks are connected thanks the filly RD first sonic rainboom. The power of friendship was used so the Elements of Harmony that were used to restore Luna to good that she KNEW would be released and appear in ponyville. She used twilight like a chess pice.
<Tovler> Octovlerfest. Woo Hoo
<Sumica> 00,10you meen this? http://screensnapr.com/v/hDcIur.jpg
<Shizuka> 13hai sumica
<CrimsonPhoenix> Where would you be after FiM is finished?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Dken2021: it's like a demoman with a frying pan O_o
<otakon17> Hiya Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10hi Shizuka and otakon17
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: In a ditch somewhere, sobbing.
<Iain> hio Sumica
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, pathetic
<otakon17> Yes I have Sumica
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: Nothing pathetic about crying.
<EspyLacopa> Legolas is such a kill stealer.
<Dken2021> Sergio_Scriptor that deadly huh?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Dken2021: yep :D
<Iain> ha labor!
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, about a show that met what every single show did before?
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: I wouldn't say that she used twilight as a chess piece. She probably could've taken care of the situation herself, but it probably would've involved killing her or banning her into the depths of space.
<Vivix> Rex_Mundi, yeah, Celestia knows a lot more than she lets on about that, but seemingly did not have the same knowledge when Chrysalis happened. It might also have a been like.. "If this don't save my sister, I might aswell loose it all" or something
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: About one of my favorite shows ending.
<otakon17> Poor Gimli
<Dken2021> Sumica huh, didn't know the hub had a twitter called leatherneckpony
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: I cry at commercials, man, crying about *anything* isn't pathetic.
<EspyLacopa> Poor poor Gimli.
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Plus, she wants her sister back. Can't forget that.
<otakon17> Squashed under an orc and a warg
<Vivix> yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> Crying isn't pathetic but if all your life you're going to cry about a show
<Iain> :D
<Vivix> Her sister is probably her closest companion
<otakon17> That both reek to the heavens
<EspyLacopa> No, squashed under an orc and -two- wargs.
<CrimsonPhoenix> then you'll need to re-evaluate your life
<alexxm> no not the direwolf
<otakon17> EspyLacopa: Ouch
<Vivix> Don't take everythign at face value
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: I didn't say all my life.
<otakon17> alexxm: Evil smelly dire wolves
<Klumzeedragon> Vivix: Yet... she still lives on the moon.
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: She loves her sister, and she was waiting for her to stop being jealous of Celestia.
<Rex_Mundi> Hmm, not sure if Celestia could have beaten NMM. We dont know how powerful she was.
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: But I promise you I will cry after the series finale.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I said after the show ends not when it will
<otakon17> Also, anyone here ever read The DM of the Rings?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: i mean only luna and celestia can live forever,i lived forever and saw everyone i loved dieing in my front i would like to keep in touch with the other guy that lives till eternity :|
<Shizuka> 13a great comic
<Rex_Mundi> otakon17: I did
<Vivix> yeah
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: is that why Celestia told the people of Equestria her sister was a cannibal?
<Shizuka> 13darths and droids is good but it's dragging on too long
<alfopony> lov me some ebay time
<Iain> I would have pushed him
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: Not on her own, not only that she didn't want to destroy her
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: You know, that whole Nightmare Night thing
<Vivix> Fl00tersh41, that was a myth spun by ponies, not Celestia
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: Probably a folk story, not Celestia's story
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: That was Pinkie pie.:S
<Vivix> well, as far as we know
<otakon17> Fl00tersh41: No that was myths and legends about NmM
<Iain> :S
<Vivix> plus NMM and Luna might be seperated enough that Celestia did not think it mattered
<Fl00tersh41> But she could have set the record straight
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: Plus, that was Superstition.
<otakon17> Fl00tersh41: True
<Shizuka> 13it's minas tirith minus minas tirith
<EspyLacopa> I would totally live on the moon if I had the ability to commute from moon to earth in a few minutes.
<SirGanjalf> Woah, rifftrax LotR
<Vivix> plus of course, they were all surprised when NMM turend out to be Luna
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: Assuming that she knew about Ponyville customs
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: There will always be superstition anf conspirices.
<otakon17> Its only a model
<Fl00tersh41> But she let that little story fester for a thousand years
<Shizuka> 13i spy a shamrocs
<Sergio_Scriptor> otakon17: :D
<Shamroc> Shizuka: hmm wut?
<Ryunosuke> HEY DENIS. THERE IS SOME LOVELY FILTH OVER HERE
<Iain> how long is this?
<otakon17> Fl00tersh41: Maybe Tia thought it was funny
<red_ony> too long
<Ryunosuke> Iain, like 3 hours
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: We have no way of knowing how old that story is, could've only been around for like 40 years for all we know
<Iain> jeez
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: But is "my sister is a cannibal" the kind of superstision you would ignore?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Iain: more 1 hour and 26 minutes :)
<otakon17> Lain another 1h25m
<Vivix> no I think NMM and Luna was considered seperate enouh that celestia did not care
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: I wouldn't go that far.:D
<Iain> :) only 1 hour
<otakon17> Hiya DeathStar how are ya dear?
<Fl00tersh41> tSparx: It was around long enough have become a traditional festivity
<otakon17> lain 1h25m
<Rex_Mundi> Maybe NMM was a cannibal?
<Iain> oh
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: Still, even if she told them, there are people in Equestria that don't like Celestia.
<DeathStar> otakon17: I'm good ^_^
<ShadowQuill> Yep
<Dken2021> ello DeathStar
<otakon17> Iain dammit that I looks like an l
<Shizuka> 13he fell
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: Plus, it's a ghost tale.
<ShadowQuill> GigabitHarmonie: Hey
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: And? That could be very young
<otakon17> Shizuka: Off a cliff
<Shizuka> 13what, on a banana peel, over a cliff, into a pile of hay WHAT?
<Klumzeedragon> Fl00tersh41: I just don't think she wanted to keep bringing up that she was sisters with NMM...
<GigabitHarmonie> Hello ShadowQuill.
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: Kwanza's about that old
<AJIsAwesome> Fl00tersh41: THey took it to heart rather than a harmless joke. It's their fault.
<red_ony> dramatic music7
<otakon17> Lol Shizuka
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Prick> everybody loves dwarves
<ShadowQuill> gtg, probably catch you guys at movie time
<Ryunosuke> dwarves ... make
<Ryunosuke> nevermind
<otakon17> Prick: Especially the women
<Iain> he sounds like the engiener
<otakon17> Ryunosuke: Weapons
<Ryunosuke> men like dwarf womens
<Ryunosuke> if they shave the beards
<Fl00tersh41> kwanza is a variation of another holiday that is already there
<red_ony> I wonder why I liked these movies that much when younger
<red_ony> spectacle
<Rex_Mundi> This is funny http://madhotaru.deviantart.com/art/Hot-Plot-324342188
<Iain> a bomb
<Shizuka> 13and then grima wormtongue dropped a candle in it and saruman blew up
<Shizuka> 13the end
<otakon17> Kanoom
<Vivix> I still say that NMM and Luna was considered seperate enoguh that Celestia did not interfere, with how even Twilight was shocked at Luna, and so forth-
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: Well, maybe the modern-day Nightmare Night is too.
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: "Hot Plot"?:S
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: I'm not saying you're wrong
<Ryunosuke> NMM was... an aspect of Luna, like Vader and Anakin
<Ryunosuke> thats how I see it
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: I'm saying we don't have enough info to say either way. Like a lot of this stuff, admittedly, but
<Klumzeedragon> Shizuka: If only it were that easy to get rid of him!
<Malk> tSparx This is Sparta
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: Its part of the joke. lol, the look on AJs face
<Fl00tersh41> tSparx: The modern day NMM was in abook from olden times
<Rex_Mundi> Id vote for Sarumon
<Fl00tersh41> My guess would be that NMM stories have been around since she tried to take over
<Ryunosuke> Hot Plot: Part Duex was better
<Ryunosuke> :p
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: You mean NMN? I meant the story behind it.
<AJIsAwesome> Sarumon 2012
<otakon17> Rex_Mundi: Lol dat AJ face
<otakon17> Brb
<EspyLacopa> Saruman is a poor man's Sauron.
<Iain> this has a great plot. and no that that kind you might think of :P
<Vivix> Ryunosuke, yeah I think so too, but in the minds of the ponies, they did not know NMM is Luna, so why would Celestia attempt to fix it, linking Luna to NMM?
<tSparx> Fl00tersh41: That NMM'll eat ya
<Rex_Mundi> Sarumon>Romney
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: how much longer must he extend this discussion ?it's ridicilous we obvously have not enought information to make up our minds :| in a bit we will start talking if flim & flam wore realy scamers and not just honest ponies trying to make a living :\
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: Nothing wrong with discussing headcanon
<Iain> has he been smoking?
<Vivix> Meh, discussing nerdism is fun
<Ryunosuke> like how Yoda didnt discern Anakin vs Vader? :)
<Vivix> ppossibly
<Malk> Rex_Mundi Ron Paul
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: Be glad this isn't #StarTrek, talk about speculation xD
<Vivix> I'm not good at Star Wars history
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: True.
<tSparx> (I don't know if that's a real channel here on ponychat, but you know what I mean)
<Tovler> dat old man river
<Sergio_Scriptor> tSparx: i agree,it is fun,but it just lasts forever XD and also yeah,you are right,thank god it's not a wars vs Trek site :D
<Vivix> thing is discussing this is fun because it must make sense with the information we are given- it's a passtime
<Iain> :D
<Vivix> hehe
<Fl00tersh41> tSparx: The problem with your headcannon, is that "NMM being cannibal is a new thing" is just as much of an assumption as assuming it's old
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: yeah :)it is fun sometimes :P
<Ryunosuke> suddenly MLP shipping
<Fl00tersh41> But since NMM stories would have been around since NMM tried to take over
<Vivix> I have lost a bit track of what the point is right now though
<Fl00tersh41> Wouldn't the gist of them have been set down back then?
<Klumzeedragon> Vivik: But even though she never really linked NMM with Luna, people still knew she was NMM on Lunar Eclipse. 6_9
<tSparx> All we can really do is present possibilities, and argue their merits, but we're not gonna reach a solid conclusion one way or another, 'cause it's headcanon
<Rex_Mundi> Random, but I think the ponies would smell good.
<Shizuka> 13zzzzzz
<Dken2021> he's not? aww
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: i bet twilight smells like wild berries :)
<red_ony> they actually smell like leek
<Vivix> Klumzeedragon, hmm.. I'd have to rewatch the episode- but it might be the visual similarity to the statue?
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Maybe those ponies, but real ponies smell worse than normal horses
<red_ony> lauren faust told me
<Klumzeedragon> Stop falling asleep Shizuka!
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Vivix> Horses smell great, never smelled a pony
<Malk> These commentors are very political
<Ryunosuke> I have a question
<Dken2021> wonder if pinkie smells like cotton candy?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Shizuka: stop tempting me to link video link :I
<Vivix> Luna does acknowledge it being an insult to her though
<Klumzeedragon> You know... if you want. :$
<Brad__> Dken2021, maybe the toy.
<Ryunosuke> when a filly leaves a dooor open, and their elders say "What, were you born in a barn or something?"
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Vivix> Ryunosuke, hehehe
<Rex_Mundi> Am i the only one seing Byzantine influences with the arctecture
<AJIsAwesome> GigabitHarmonie: The shows are on Saturday, right?
<AJIsAwesome> DAT TEAR CLICHE.
<Vivix> We should set up a podcast that just discuss these things on ad length
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: dont worry,you are not the only one :) im not an expert,but i can recognize some of it :P
<Malk> Rex_Mundi Its kinda easy to tell that
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: We should :)
<Klumzeedragon> Ryunosuke: They say nooooooooo, I was born in the ponyville general hospital by Dr. Horse.
<Brad__> Hasbro has something pretty amazing going on.... a group of people with money wanting to buy their toys.
<Vivix> Cat sleeping infront of monitor, powersave turned itself on *blind
<tSparx> Vivix: I'd volunteer for that, set up a topic ahead of time so that we can research, and respectfully lay out the possible headcanons, I'd love that!
*Shizuka 13yawns
<Sergio_Scriptor> Vivix: daw :3 that is so cute
<Tovler> Brad__: Its just your usual brand name loyalty
<Shizuka> 13can we hurry up and get to the swordfights..
<Dken2021> Brad__ I know, have you seen the auctions for plushies?
<Shizuka> 13this movie and pacing... eesh..
<AJIsAwesome> For a minute there, I thought that woman had snot dribbling from her nose.:D
<AJ> hai everypony
<Brad__> Dken2021, yes I have, some prices are pretty nuts...
<Dken2021> ello AJ
<Malk> tSparx what are you guys debating?
<tSparx> Shizuka: This novel and pacing, amirite?
<Sergio_Scriptor> ji AJ :)
<Ryunosuke> i'd want her to moon me
<Tovler> If only this was the extended cut.
<Brad__> But im shameless in saying I might, down the road, spend that kind of money,....
<Fl00tersh41> And this is why Agent Smith hates Humans so much
<AJIsAwesome> AJ: Hello!
<Klumzeedragon> Shizuka: That's why there's the random dialouge to kind of make it better?
<Ryunosuke> cincinnati chili
<AJ> my name WAS AppleJack The One And Only but... apperantly it was already in use
<tSparx> Malk: We're talking about various possibilities behind NMM and her perception by the ponies
<Vivix> tSparx, it would be fuun, and yeah sleepy cats are the cutest Sergio_Scriptor
<Ryunosuke> chicago skyline chili < all other chilis
<Ryunosuke> rather >
<AJIsAwesome> AJ: No it's not. Not now.
<Malk> tSparx NMM?
<AJIsAwesome> AJ: Try again.
<AJ> :O
<Tovler> Sauron > Saruman > Saruraruaruman
<tSparx> Malk: Nightmare moon
<Rex_Mundi> Rarity probobly smells good.
<Klumzeedragon> Malk: And you missed the giant discussion about unicorns and magic.
<Malk> tSparx you mean luna?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rex_Mundi: probably :P
<tSparx> Malk: No, I mean Nightmare Moon, we're not really talking about Luna
<String_Shredder> sparta!
<Rex_Mundi> Malk- Oh, and G1 ponies with Gewls for eyes.
<Cavale> Rex_Mundi i think she yould smell like freash wached cloth
<Tovler> Dr. Doom has Doombots, not Doomettes -_-
<tSparx> Malk: I mean yeah, can't really talk about one without the other, but we've been focusing on her tenure as NMM
<Dken2021> I think fluttershy would smell like a zoo
<Vivix> yeah the NMM part
<tSparx> Dken2021: God, not the ape house, I hope!
<Rex_Mundi> Applejack would smell like sweat and apples
<Vivix> it would be fun to talk about the xmas sode too, origin and all that, but I haven't seen that episode recently-
<Ryunosuke> IIRC that map came from the books
<AJ> yeah
<Vivix> also, dinner! brb darlings!
<AJ> brb
<Malk> tSparx ok I think Nightmare Moon is Blue
<AJ> i got washing to do fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<AJIsAwesome> Considering that they take baths, I'm pretty sure they don't smell bad.:D
<Klumzeedragon> Enjoy Vivix!
<Sergio_Scriptor> ok,so in the matter of the flim & flam bros,i think they wore actual decent guys,the whole taking over sweet apple acres was just their way to make a living,they dont have a home,i think that the apple family wore the real jerks on this case :\ what do you guys think ? :)
<Rex_Mundi> Is it proper to refear to hearts warming eve as a "christmas episode"?
<Tovler> Tonight, the moon is blue
<Shizuka> 13SPOI
<Ryunosuke> spoi?
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: I'd know what you meant.
<Malk> AJ and AJIsAwesome who is the real AJ?
<AJ> dunno
<Fl00tersh41> Sergio_Scriptor: That was my reading of it yes
<Sergio_Scriptor> goood diner Vivix :P
<EspyLacopa> Hobbit ninja!
<AJ> but we got some AJseption going on
<Cavale> Rex_Mundi its ponymas
<Tovler> dat short people joke
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Technically, they were trying to steal Sweet Apple Acres customers.
<AJ> BWUUUUUU N
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: i know right :)
<Dken2021> Sergio_Scriptor I guess, they were salesmen
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: it was the applefamily that refused to make a co-business with them anyway :|
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: The apple clan couldn't provide as much cider as their customerswanted
<AJ> lol
<Quick_Thinker> apple clan XD
<AJ> clan'
<Rex_Mundi> Flim and Flam diddnt have any apples of their own.
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: If they made a better offer, I'm pretty sure they would've agreed.
<String_Shredder> This sounds like stuff I would say while watching LOtR
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: Aye, they were just business men, yet the Apple Family couldnt agree to the terms.
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: But why should the apple clan's monopoly in ponyville be unchallanged by anyoen
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: I mean seriously, 75-25?
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: they never intended to steal their costumers,they wante to share the profits,they wore real nice guys,it was the apple family proud :\
<Brad__> lol ponyville economics
<AJ> but you see...
<AJ> RD kinda made things worst
<Quick_Thinker> hey everypony i found a Portal 2 map called Friendship is Magic
<AJIsAwesome> Sergio_Scriptor: Maybe, but their name Flim and Flam are paroding the word Flimflam, which is scam or hoax.
<Klumzeedragon> Sergio_Scriptor: The apple family made all the profits to keep their farm over the winter. if they didnt make enough profit off the Cider... they would have lost the farm. THAT is why they refused.
<Fl00tersh41> AJIsAwesome: They never even haggled about the percentages, 75/25 was just the opening big
<Fl00tersh41> *bid
<Quick_Thinker> and its coop
<Malk> Hey not true
<Quick_Thinker> i wonder if any pony was thinking of monorail during the flim flam song
<tSparx> It's also a Music Man parody, and the music man was unquestionably a jerk
<Sergio_Scriptor> If Flmi and flma had their own land,THEN they shoudl be considered a menace to the apple family,but yes i can see your and Klumzeedragon point of view :)
<AJIsAwesome> Kill Smeagle now!
<Quick_Thinker> damn bungess
<AJIsAwesome> Do it, you'll save so much time!:|
<AJIsAwesome> *Smeagol*
<EspyLacopa> Trust master!
<EspyLacopa> This certainly is not a trap!
<tSparx> EspyLacopa: To be fair, he wanted him to be fine.
<AJ> DICK
