<HoodyNinja> Yes. Yes it has.
<SpeedyBolt> It's been streaming for quite a while now.
<VenHur> So is there anything I missed?
<SpeedyBolt> >Kill someone
<Kinixys> ANd it's only halfway? Looong movie.
<Sumica> 00,10shame I could not hack the security termnal before the sentrys guned down the robots
<HoodyNinja> Not much, just the usual violence we see on this site
<Wirisme> I'm not used to it, but it's quite good
<zerograv5> im sticking with this till the end
<VenHur> God, first Ethan got his finget cutted up and NOW he has to KILL someone...
<VenHur> *finger
<Reikim> I'm sensing an escalation here.
<SpeedyBolt> Magic Piano Playing Jayden.
<HoodyNinja> If only playing an instrument was that easy
<Petrified_Discord> ...How you playing the piano with your left hand?
<Reikim> Wasn't there another game that did this? An adventure game?
<Wirisme> Need a controller with 88 buttons
<cachi01|phone> Reikim RE?
<Polydunami> This reminds me of Atlantica in Kingdom Hearts II :S
<SpeedyBolt> Vodka?
<Barbetos> Vodka for EVERYBODY!!
<Reikim> No no, it was called...Harvest.
<thelonepony> Vodka is mother russia Milk
<VenHur> We ALL know how we loved that so called "level".
<JusticeKoro> Looks like Mr. Rogers
<DarkStratos> SOOOO whats happened so far..?
<cachi01|phone> Soooo he is batman
<cachi01|phone> And thats alfred
<DarkStratos> and who the heck is that guy
<cachi01|phone> Alfred
<SpeedyBolt> Well Technically
<Meanwhile> This guy is NORMAN JAYDEN.
<Barbetos> fawken idea
<SpeedyBolt> You cant kidnap your kid if he's your offspring.
<Reikim> I like this guy.
<SpeedyBolt> In a sense, you own him.
<DarkStratos> ya then its technically called taking him on a vacation
<Reikim> Harvester!
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Reikim> Makes me think of Harvester.
<Barbetos> wat you talkin about butla?
<Wirisme> Kidnap kid, send ransom to yourself
<DarkStratos> why are his sunglasses glowing
<HoodyNinja> Damnit, im out of chicken
<Barbetos> His vision is augmented.
<Petrified_Discord> Wirisme: Profit
<Jason> suddenly mars
<DarkStratos> MARS?!!?
<SpeedyBolt> Were you here for the first few chapters, DarkStratos?
<SpeedyBolt> Ethan Mars?
<VenHur> Suddently MARS!
<HoodyNinja> Wut?
<Cades> wait, r u going to sleep irl?
<Reikim> ...Okay.
<DarkStratos> define first few
<Cades> or sims?
<DarkStratos> and wtf is THIS
<Meanwhile> Fuck you I'm Norman.
<cachi01|phone> DarkStratios they are Augmented Reality glasses ARI
<twilight_sprinkle> Look at your planet, no back to Norman. Hes on Mars.
<SpeedyBolt> Underwater enviroment is best enviroment
<Reikim> Is he tripping or exhibiting godlike powers?
<Kandarihu> SpeedyBolt, only if a court strips you of custody
<twilight_sprinkle> *now
<Polydunami> Norman's office or something?
<cachi01|phone> Yep
<HoodyNinja> Reikim: Virtual reality chamber?
<Reikim> Or is this some kind of virtual world?
<DarkStratos> so is this based in the future slightly?
<twilight_sprinkle> its his goggles
<twilight_sprinkle> apparently theyre high-tech
<twilight_sprinkle> or hes high
<Reikim> Because this man just rocketed up to #1 on my list of cool characters in this game.
<SpeedyBolt> I think this is all his view from his glasses.
<HoodyNinja> and im also guessing the glove
<cachi01|phone> Fucking google glasses
<twilight_sprinkle> and he might be, since he takes drugs
<HoodyNinja> controller of some sort?
<VenHur> This game promotes cars...um...yay?
<cachi01|phone> HoodyNinja eeyup
<Petrified_Discord> HoodyNinja: It's the glasses and the glove
<cachi01|phone> VenHur nope. Thats LBP2
<HoodyNinja> Petrified_Discord: I want one
<VenHur> Not just any glove...it's the Power Glove mk ii!
<HoodyNinja> 3D bronystate would be awesome
<cachi01|phone> Which promoted tje PRIUS
<cachi01|phone> The
<DarkStratos> so wait he has to take a drug to do this or something?
<shibaru> Yea
<Petrified_Discord> HoodyNinja: Be careful not to indulge too much...it can be dangerous...VERY dangerous.
<shibaru> night
<Reikim> So anyway, this guy has the coolest office ever.
<DarkStratos> since the butler dude said dont overindulge in something
<HoodyNinja> ^
<HoodyNinja> DAMN YOU DarkStratos !
<SpeedyBolt> He cant be the Origami killer, though
<SpeedyBolt> Because the killer is white.
<Jason> i say its the butler
<DarkStratos> lol ruined your arrow HoodyNinja :P
<Jason> its always the butler
<SpeedyBolt> ...Or so Jayden said.
<Wirisme> ^
<Reikim> How do we know that, Speedy?
<DarkStratos> OH SNAP BLOOD
<Jason> hes tripping balls
<SpeedyBolt> Here we go again
<HoodyNinja> poison on the glasses?
<Meanwhile> Killers usually kill within their own racial group unless the killing itself is racially motivated.
<twilight_sprinkle> so yeah, looks like its not the goggles and its just drugs
<DarkStratos> so now he is alternate realitying?
<Meanwhile> "Fact of the day"
<Wirisme> So far so good <_<
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: ... Dude, how much do you read?
<Meanwhile> I've done quite a bit of reading about the minds of serial killers actually.
<DarkStratos> wait what was in the tube, painkiller?
<Jason> lol, the way he walks
<Buytoast> magic salt
<Reikim> That's actually a fascinating topic. Serial killers, I mean.
<Caramel> 2,14 a drug, called triptocane
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont see why killers would care about race if it werent motivated by it.
<Meanwhile> The alternate reality thing is his glasses, a type of HUD.
<DarkStratos> wtf does triptocane do?
<Wirisme> showering, you're doing it wrong
<Meanwhile> Him getting the shakes is because he's an addict.
<HoodyNinja> Some people just want to see the world burn
<Caramel> 2,14 it's just a made up drug
<Reikim> His nose is bleeding.
<DarkStratos> and the EYES
<Jason> dem eys
<Caramel> 2,14 and he's going through withdrawal from it
<HoodyNinja> suddenly crime boss
<Reikim> That's some pretty tough withdrawal.
<Buytoast> I STARE INTO YOUR SOUL AND FEAST ON YOUR SINS
<Sumica> 00,10is that like fuckitdol?
<DarkStratos> ah ok and what does it cause you to do?
<Buytoast> AND YOUR FRIDGE
<AndChat|679296> Eh
<Petrified_Discord> It's never actually stated what triptocane DOES
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: NOT THE FRIDGE!
<VenHur> HE'S STARIN- Okay, this is the FIFTH time I said that, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Caramel buy why does it always hit him after using his glasses ?
<Caramel> 2,14 stops your shakes
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: Some think it's a safety thing. Killers are often drawn to kill people they understand because if you understand your prey it's easier to do away with.
<DarkStratos> ok so he is just addicted to a drug
<Caramel> 2,14 good question Trixie :P
<Reikim> I say plot
<HoodyNinja> inb4 Meanwhile is a psychologyst
<cachi01|phone> inb4 Meanwhile is a killer
<Reikim> The other possibility is that the glasses are his other addiction, and when not using one, he's using the other.
<HoodyNinja> inb4 Hes a psycho killer! :o
<Meanwhile> I have no qualifications but I have studied psychology to a degree.
<Meanwhile> No comment as to whether I've killed anyone.
<DarkStratos> repairs clock to keeps track of time, tries to ignore time...seems legit
<Reikim> So when not using the glasses he's used to being doped up on triptocame, so when he stops working the urge immediately kicks in.
<SpeedyBolt> and then they all got drunk.
<DarkStratos> ah ok
<cachi01|phone> And theres still 3 more hours of game
<DarkStratos> and cuts him off
<HoodyNinja> So, we're debating what a video game character is addicted to.
<Kinixys> Oh boy. I'll never last. G'night y'all.
<DarkStratos> haha yeps
<HoodyNinja> ...This is fine with me
<DarkStratos> gnight Kinixys
<thelonepony> night Kinixys
<cachi01|phone> Night Kinixys
<Wirisme> night
<HoodyNinja> later Kinixys
<Reikim> >quicktime event to clink glasses together
<Reikim> Unnecessary, perhaps?
<Kinixys> Thanks for the good times, everypony.
<HoodyNinja> This is almost as good a movie as Other M
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: Night! :)
<Meanwhile> They remember every so often that this is a game and not a movie.
<Meanwhile> "Oh crap add a button!"
<Wirisme> I'd call it somewhere inbetween
<Reikim> It's more like a movie where you get to make decisions.
<Reikim> And what's with the girl?
<Meanwhile> That's the mother of one of the dead kids.
<SpeedyBolt> A whore.
<Reikim> Is she real?
<HoodyNinja> TICK, TOCK, TICK, TOCK.
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<SpeedyBolt> ...No, I literally think she was a whore.
<cachi01|phone> A whore....literally
<Meanwhile> And yeah she was a whore.
<VenHur> CLOCK. IS. TICK. ING.
<Polydunami> Retired from the business?
<HoodyNinja> I love this movie
<Meanwhile> So much ticking.
<Reikim> ...Why is there a whore there?
<Reikim> Where did she come from?
<HoodyNinja> Who cares?
<Wirisme> Imagine working there
<Wirisme> with all the ticking
<Wirisme> and tocking
<Wirisme> constantly
<HoodyNinja> ^
<Jason> its starting to get on my nerves already
<HoodyNinja> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Reikim> ^^^
<Petrified_Discord> Wirisme: Sooner or later the tocking turns into talking... :O
<Polydunami> There was ticking?
<Reikim> This is starting to get to my head...
<DarkStratos> back
<SpeedyBolt> Tickticktickticktick
<cachi01|phone> ^^^^^^
<HoodyNinja> I like how nobody noticed it until i said something *trollface*
<DarkStratos> what happened to the old dude
<SpeedyBolt> OH SHIT
<Polydunami> It's more soothing in my opinion.
<DarkStratos> holy shit that is one annoying grandfatherclock
<SpeedyBolt> 3rd thing that has made me jump
<Polydunami> But then again, I like to know what the time is :P
<DarkStratos> HE OVERDOSED
<Klumzeedragon> Watch. The killer signed, "The Killer" on the books. So that's how they'll know.
<Wirisme> I like to know what time it is 20 times
<SpeedyBolt> ded.
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<Reikim> ...Well that's just great.
<thelonepony> Manfred NOOOO!!
<Meanwhile> No, really?
<Meanwhile> He's dead?
<HoodyNinja> None of my classrooms have clocks
<SpeedyBolt> "Oh my god, hes dead"
<Reikim> How was he killed?
<DarkStratos> wtf happened?
<Meanwhile> Brilliant deduction.
<SpeedyBolt> God...deead...god...
<HoodyNinja> THIS SHOULD BE PARADISE!
<Reikim> It wasn't a gun. No noise.
<Wirisme> Oh my god that was the last of the ketchup
<Buytoast> Shit man, now who will tell time.
<HoodyNinja> ^
<SpeedyBolt> Father Time?
<DarkStratos> lol you were there when it happened i wonder why they blame you..
<HoodyNinja> except with a ?
<Klumzeedragon> Bitch. We leave.
<cachi01|phone> He was father time
<Reikim> I guess you could say the killer was just *shades* killing time.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, because that wouldn't be suspicious
<DarkStratos> isn't he posed to be removing fingerprints
<SpeedyBolt> Yes
<HoodyNinja> CriticKitten: Innocent until proven in a court of law
<Jason> dramatic wiping: engage
<SpeedyBolt> That's what hes doing now...I think
<Maid_RainBow> the glass hurry
<Buytoast> haha, you think people actually go by the whole innocent thing?
<HoodyNinja> back and forth, back and forth
<Petrified_Discord> Imagine if the ticking of the clocks got louder during this part :P
<HoodyNinja> No, but you can still use it
<HoodyNinja> IT IS GETTING LOUDER!
<Reikim> Time is ticking, guys. Time is ticking...
<Polydunami> Sando furoa
<Buytoast> yeah man, polish them clocks all nice and gentle like
<SpeedyBolt> Clock is ticking Shelby
<DarkStratos> i can already tell he will forget to clean the head of the dancing girl so they will get a fingerprint off that
<SpeedyBolt> Clock. Is. TICKING!
<Reikim> DarkStratos: ...Nope. They can't get a fingerpringt from that.
<HoodyNinja> DarkStratos: SSSSHHHHH
<DarkStratos> ah
<cachi01|phone> Oh god i hate pressing triangle.....
<cachi01|phone> Freaking MGS4......

<VenHur> HE'S...ah screw it...
<cachi01|phone> U always forget something

<Reikim> What was even the point of that?
<pony_5485> Dunn[
<pony_5485> Dunno
<Reikim> Regardless of waht you do, the game leaves a print on the door...what a waste of time.
<DarkStratos> haha
<CriticKitten> ....are you serious?
<VenHur> ...Is it me, or is that guy or girl new...=
<VenHur> *?
<CriticKitten> So why bother wiping anything down?
<SpeedyBolt> Wait

<MASF123> Grave keeper is a Spy.
<Cades> naw i quit
<Meanwhile> Everyone is suspicious.
<DarkStratos> THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES IN GAMES
<Meanwhile> It was probably Surgeon Guy.
<Canadian_Brony> IKR?
<DarkStratos> YES
<DarkStratos> A NORMAL MAN
<DarkStratos> NOT SOME FREAK
<Canadian_Brony> 1977. When does this game take place?
<NoPonyEpic> Yay I love stories
<MASF123> Except for dying and having to restART THE damn level again.
<SpeedyBolt> Hoodlums
<SpeedyBolt> :p
<Reikim> So this game takes place in 2007? And not a computer to be found?
<DarkStratos> they just wanted drugs!
<MASF123> me head fuggein' hurts.
<NoPonyEpic> What a loving father

<DarkStratos> Yes lets run around in a CONSTRUCTION ZONE
<Canadian_Brony> stupid stereotypical drunk father
<DarkStratos> the fu?
<DarkStratos> oh
<Reikim> Origami Killer is the brother, and the kid was killed by the father, thus the testing of Ethan in order to see if a father can really love his son.
<Canadian_Brony> Meanwhile LoLz I'm saving that
<DarkStratos> was like wtf is he doin trying to hide?
<MASF123> STupid sexy drunk father
<Reikim> This is my theory for now.
<Klumzeedragon> Reikim: Maaaaaaaaan.
<DarkStratos> This kid is totally gonna die in the construction zone
<Canadian_Brony> O RLY
<MASF123> Ikr
<DarkStratos> nothing ever good happens in construction zones
<Klumzeedragon> Rubarbed?

<Wirisme> what if it's a construction zone for a hospital?
<SpeedyBolt> Yes
<VenHur> Yup.

<Canadian_Brony> "Jump of deatH
<Canadian_Brony> "
<OneTrickPony> parkour!
<Meanwhile> And then he whacked his gnads on the corner and fell to brain damage.
<Canadian_Brony> sounds promising
<MASF123> RUN UP THE WALL!!!! :O
<Wirisme> _|\ All you have to do is take a cup of flour, add it to the mix _|\
<DarkStratos> maybe I should post less

<DarkStratos> lol ofcourse he injured himself, the retard
<Canadian_Brony> inb4 dead
<MASF123> Help...help...help....help....
<Reikim> Should've skipped forward.
<Canadian_Brony> should've done it earlier
<flutterchu> uh oh (agian)
<Klumzeedragon> DarkStratos: Ah yeah, and theres an auto kick if you post more than 9 times in like 6 seconds. Just so you know. :)
<SpeedyBolt> You cant leave ANYBODY alone in this game without them getting themselves killed.
<NoPonyEpic> Should've counted faster :P
<MASF123> Dead
<Wirisme> this was a good idea
<DarkStratos> that monotonous heelp heeelp heelp
<Reikim> Also, his cries for help are just pathetic.
<OneTrickPony> break his foot!
<DarkStratos> Klumzeedragon: ya I just discovered that
<SpeedyBolt> "Help >.>"
<Canadian_Brony> dat VA
<MASF123> Caramel, you let him die?
<SpeedyBolt> "Help <.<"
<Wirisme> Yep cya
<OneTrickPony> let him die!
<Reikim> It's kind of preordained that he's not going to get help.
<NoPonyEpic> I'm imagining someone gonna pull a Mufasa
<NoPonyEpic> oh nm...
<SpeedyBolt> Well that was your huge spoiler
<VenHur> He becamed Harry Potter, that's all.
<JESmith71> So is the cutscene different if you save him (If he can be)?
<Wirisme> and we never see him again
<Reikim> "Looks like a storm's coming" "What, ANOTHER one?"

<Canadian_Brony> >heavily
<Klumzeedragon> DarkStratos: Yeah. :P Figured. That's why I'm letting you know. :)
<SpeedyBolt> I think they're saying he actually dies.
<VenHur> Because...you know...the boy that lived...that's funny...y'know?
<OneTrickPony> these voice actors are so good!
<MASF123> Oh THAT's why It's called HEAVY RAIN :O Talk about eye candy.
<DarkStratos> VenHur: sure..
<Wirisme> That guy.... isn't gonna try to kill them?
<SpeedyBolt> Somehow.
<DarkStratos> THAT GUY ISNT NATURAL, he didnt try and kill them...
<NoPonyEpic> Dun Dun DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Canadian_Brony> thirty years . . . that would mean this game takes place in 2007
<Meanwhile> Well then.
<DarkStratos> wtf is odd about that
<Reikim> But still...remember how this kid was teh exact same one who previously had enough arm strength to haul himself over a large section of I-beam.
<SpeedyBolt> JAYDEN
<Meanwhile> Oh hey Norman.

<Canadian_Brony> when do sunglasses do this?
<SpeedyBolt> They wont let us see nude here, MASF123
<xtremetoxicguy> ...uh...I don't even
<Wirisme> that F word was ill-placed
<MASF123> Caramel, but she's hot.
<Canadian_Brony> I mean . . . this is 2007
<Reikim> I don't think we have a particular NEED to see nude here.
<Reikim> Cmon, focus on the film noir here.
<SpeedyBolt> She might be hot, but Caramel is not a pervert.
<xtremetoxicguy> Ohhh this is a game :D
<SpeedyBolt> Atleast I dont THINK he is.
<xtremetoxicguy> lol
<Meanwhile> She's made of pixels.
<Canadian_Brony> NO SHIT
<Meanwhile> What's the matter with you.
<DarkStratos> lol naw it was a cannonball
<Caramel> 2,14 no, I'm not an old chinese doctor
<DarkStratos> HAHA
<SpeedyBolt> Pfft
<Reikim> Would a bullet to the brain cause instant death?
<Canadian_Brony> >bullet hole between the eyes
<doughnutjoe> Should i buy this game?
<Reikim> Necessarily?
<Canadian_Brony> >instant death
<SpeedyBolt> That guy was obviously a necrophilist.
<Canadian_Brony> REALLY?!?
<Reikim> doughnutjoe: Only if you're prepared, psychologically, to deal with it.
<Meanwhile> Reikim: Neccessarily, no. People have survived being shot in the head before.
<xtremetoxicguy> with my 480 screen, it looked like a weird TV show XD
<MASF123> Some people have survived gun shots to the brain.
<SpeedyBolt> They HAVE?
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Thought so. I'll chalk it up to magic glasses then.
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<DarkStratos> with what injuries?

<MASF123> Yes
<Reikim> doughnutjoe: This is far, far more scarring.
<DarkStratos> lol insta techno
<Klumzeedragon> doughnutjoe: If you were here since the beggining you wouldnt have too. :D Caramel's played almost the whole thing in this one sitting.

<Canadian_Brony> Caramel . . . who and how?
<SpeedyBolt> Ethan's Son.
<Reikim> DarkStratos: Ethan's son.

<JusticeKoro> Better dash on over to Rainbow Lane
<SpeedyBolt> I never really read Rainbow Factory
<Reikim> For starters, the majority of pegasus society as portrayed in that fic.
<DarkStratos> why is it called a butterfly knife in the first place and same
<xtremetoxicguy> he's so depressed he can't even walk right! :)
<Reikim> After that, probably the author.
<doughnutjoe> Maybe i should give it a read
<Spectrum_Rush> Reikim: song or fic
<Wirisme> Is it bad?
<Reikim> Spectrum_Rush: Fic.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh look, its raining
*Klumzeedragon hugs Reikim. "Noooo stabbing things" :)
<SpeedyBolt> Oh shit
<Canadian_Brony> there's a street I can walk to called "Rainbow Drive"
<doughnutjoe> is it that bad?
<VenHur> Rainbow Factory makes me want to hug Fluttershy like there's no tomorrow...
<xtremetoxicguy> Maybe ponies will stop his depression!
<SpeedyBolt> Dam cops ruin everything
<Canadian_Brony> and a park called "Rainbow Park"
<Reikim> Now we just need a Rainbow Road...
<twilight_sprinkle> wow, stuff sure went to hell
<DarkStratos> lol mad dash into house, walks slowly, mad dash to open door, closes and walks slowly again
<Wirisme> Rainbow Ride
<Jason> what is it with cops and doors?
<xtremetoxicguy> Epic parkour
<oni_link> did you set it to wumbo?
<doughnutjoe> Did he play as the lady yet?
<Canadian_Brony> shoot him?

<Meanwhile> But still, quite surprising first time round.
<SpeedyBolt> Back in previous chapters, he did always change a bit when Lauren bought up the killer.
<doughnutjoe> is that a baby?
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: Maybe you're accepting that some people are just dumb?
<XAX> Klumzeedragon: Daaaaamn.
<twilight_sprinkle> so this guy is the killer?
<Meanwhile> Aye.
<SpeedyBolt> If you havent figured it out.
<twilight_sprinkle> i zoned out in the middle of the story so i missed a part
<SpeedyBolt> Scott Shelby, Is the killer.
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont even remember his name
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon... perhaps... No, no defenatly not. Or I hope not.
<Caramel> 2,14 Scott Shelby
<Caramel> 2,14 Formerly known as Scott Shepard
<MASF123> The fatguy is the killer? :O
<SpeedyBolt> Yup.
<scottish-geeky> killer fat guy
<twilight_sprinkle> fat bastard
<SpeedyBolt> SHAUN!
<doughnutjoe> SHAAAAUN
<twilight_sprinkle> why did he kill them though, just insane?
<doughnutjoe> my fav part
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: Should have known. Someone said it earlier too. :I
<SpeedyBolt> I assume this is the last chapter, right?
<doughnutjoe> <3
<SpeedyBolt> 5.848 Inches of rainfall.

<MASF123> In Mafia II they once said, "Aim for the fat bastard!"
<doughnutjoe> SHAAAUN
<TheRandomkid321> SHAUUUUUUUUN!
<twilight_sprinkle> JASON
<doughnutjoe> JAAAYSOON
<Slenderman> Guys...
<doughnutjoe> o hai

<Slenderman> What do you call a creepy guy who's a brony but clops to bronies? Cuz theres a lot on Omegle...
<SpeedyBolt> Yes.
<Buytoast> you mean Fattus Maximus was the guy all along?
<SpeedyBolt> My father isnt too fond of me. :I
<SpeedyBolt> Yes
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: si
<SpeedyBolt> Scott Shelby was the murderer.
<doughnutjoe> SHAUN
<TheRandomkid321> Poor guy... Why do I always feel saddened for the villains :'(
<Meanwhile> Fuck you I'm Norman!
<twilight_sprinkle> shoot hiim
<scottish-geeky> so
<SpeedyBolt> I have a question
<SpeedyBolt> Can Shaun die if you take too long here?
<TheRandomkid321> I KNEW HEAVY RAIN WAS A GAME NAME!
<Meanwhile> No idea.
<doughnutjoe> FUN FACT: Did you know that some guy on youtube glitched his game and he could say SHAAUN when ever he wanted to?
<Meanwhile> But it'd be bloody annoying if he did.
<MASF123> Because villians are people too just have a lust for murder is all they can't help it.
<MASF123> It's like an urge.
<scottish-geeky> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> MASF123: villains like that should be just executed
<MASF123> ...I think people should get 2nd chances,
<scottish-geeky> so
<MASF123> Even if a murderer.
<twilight_sprinkle> MASF123: if they do it for the thrill, theres no helping them
<MASF123> Punishment yeah, but still...
<doughnutjoe> Thats what i call some.....HEAVY RAIN
<twilight_sprinkle> a fat guy just snuck up on him on a two-way path..
<scottish-geeky> MASF123: even fredom hating taroist
<Klumzeedragon> How could he not hear chubbs magee running on a steel beam?
<TheRandomkid321> twilight_sprinkle if they do it by mental illness or a dark past they should have a second chanch
<SpeedyBolt> Because Jayden is deaf.
<doughnutjoe> LOL
<SpeedyBolt> Either that, or the intense rain and the conveyor belt sounds.
<doughnutjoe> dat box throw
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: lol'd.
<twilight_sprinkle> TheRandomkid321: if its an ilness, then its too dangerous to leave them alive, and often pointless
<Meanwhile> Live you little bastard.
<Meanwhile> If you die now I'll kill you.
<Klumzeedragon> Use the pipe!
<SpeedyBolt> YOU GOTTA BREAAAATHE
<doughnutjoe> shaun is ded
<scottish-geeky> Meanwhile: lol

<twilight_sprinkle> according to mood whiplash standards, he had to have survived in this case
<SpeedyBolt> Oh shit.
<Spectrum_Rush> good!, didnt want to break out ManUp.jpg for this one
<SpeedyBolt> HAVENT WE HAD ENOUGH SCARES?
<Klumzeedragon> "I STILL hate you for turning off the TV on me!"
<Meanwhile> And then he dies.
<SpeedyBolt> ...so it was a trust exercise.
<twilight_sprinkle> yay
<doughnutjoe> suddenly poison kicks in
<OneTrickPony> and then ded
<SpeedyBolt> So we have 2w main still alive.
<doughnutjoe> yup

<Caramel> 2,14 strange, they changed the ending
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: How so?
<twilight_sprinkle> so wait, what was with his blackouts?
<Caramel> 2,14 normally, if madison isn't alive, they shoot Ethan when he leaves the building
<scottish-geeky> well that was ameusing
<SpeedyBolt> So...
<SpeedyBolt> He can still kill people?
<Meanwhile> Maybe it's because he had the kid with him.
<SpeedyBolt> He got grinded.
<Caramel> 2,14 no, it didn't matter before
<doughnutjoe> fuck jaydon had bad ass shades
<Caramel> 2,14 which made it even more depressing
<MASF123> Norman died a hero....and a virgin.
<Meanwhile> I dunno then. Guess it's just fussy.
<scottish-geeky> MASF123: dat spy
<Caramel> 2,14 because shaun watched his dad die in front of him
<SpeedyBolt> They only shoot him if he goes alone, right?
<Waffles> ive never saw this ending before...
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: Ah. Maybe some people thought it was toooo depressing and complained. So they slapped a coat of Mass Effect fixer on it.
<Meanwhile> That would have been really really depressing.
<SpeedyBolt> Or if Madison fails to get into the building?
<Sylandest> d'aww...
<Caramel> 2,14 probably
<OneTrickPony> awwww
<Caramel> 2,14 a shame, I was going for a super bad ending
<Meanwhile> Pft.
<TheRandomkid321> This is a depressing game...
<Caramel> 2,14 with only one redeeming qualith
<MASF123> Norman is dead and all is well son, let me but you some Ice Cream.

<Klumzeedragon> Phase4: But I suppose it's a good movie. Starts out with a kid who like model rocket ships, then wants to be an astronaught or something, I don't rightfully remember.
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Night you silly pony. :)
<Klumzeedragon> And that's a large number. 6_9

<AdamTheDuck> Yay I come back to finally see a Kerbal stream. :3
<Klumzeedragon> Makes perfect sense. I can see why you'd want to use teh hax tank.

<Klumzeedragon> What's up Moopy? :)
<Moopy> Do you think you might be able to play duke nukem with me?
<Klumzeedragon> I don't have duke nukem Moopy. :P
<Moopy> I thought you did?
<Klumzeedragon> A long time ago, I sold it as soon as I beat it.
<Moopy> Wait superbrony64 has it
<Klumzeedragon> No pony mods Phase4? :P
<therainbowvortex> hey everypony it is i

<Klumzeedragon> And yeah, SB64 said he had like a copy for everything. And 2 for the PS3.
<therainbowvortex> hey Moopy told ya id be back
<MadSurge> WOW, girl playing TF2? :D
<Moopy> Can he stream it over the air so that way i can be on the air dude?
<Klumzeedragon> dat 360! xD
<MadSurge> Ohai XAX and Gold_Demona!
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo MadSurge
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: fucking Bobsled Bonanza D:<
<Gold_Demona> IKR?
<Gold_Demona> This map is weird. O_o
<Klumzeedragon> I have no idea Moopy. I don't tell him what to stream. :D So ask him next time you're both on. Just remember, he usually streams to late for you to be on.
<Klumzeedragon> too*
<Moopy> awwww
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I already had enough trouble with Zombotany, and now there's a second too!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I wow, yeah. That one's such a pain.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I eventually got it though.
<Phase4> 00,02Klumzeedragon, there is one pony mod
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the thorn minefield strategy worked well, but what about Zombotany 2? I'm afraid :(
<Klumzeedragon> These ones Phase4. http://kassgrein.deviantart.com/
<Phase4> 00,02Klumzeedragon, i meen i have one installed
<Klumzeedragon> Oh. :D Which one?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Lots of tallnuts, lots of spikeweed, and if you have the Imitater, use it as a flower so you get more flowers faster.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: last plant to buy, incidentally
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I usually use imitater flowers anyway cuz I like having lots of flowers really fast.
<Klumzeedragon> Dat Spy check. :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also having a frozen peashooter in every row helps early on.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Yay, achievement! :D
<Gold_Demona> Yay!~
<MadSurge> :D a mime potato!
<Gold_Demona> lol, Yup. I love it
<Gold_Demona> ImiTATER. Get it? XD
<MadSurge> Column Like you See 'Em was easy
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, that one's cake.
<Klumzeedragon> That derpy poster. :D
<Moopy> Hey phase4 what did that picture say sex makes what?
<Phase4> 00,02babies
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: where does the yeti zombie appear?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It appears randomly
<Moopy> oh
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Mostly in the story mode.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: is it special in any way?
<Klumzeedragon> Like a boss. Just stand there and eat a sandwich while everything blows up around you. xD
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Not really. It's kinda tough, but once it gets low in health, it runs away
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :| instakill plants is the answer.
<Moopy> Hey is that how they die by laughing like that?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Like the tater mine? I love using those early on.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: And the squash is nice too. :3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I personally prefer catapults and squashes. :D
<Phase4> 00,02we need pony surf servers
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: My only problem with catapults is they're more expensive and slower. They're not good at the beginning.
<Klumzeedragon> Make one? :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I start out with regular peashooters and frozen peas and then as I go, replace them with melons.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also pumpkins are very handy
<Prick> listen to JayJay
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I keep on forgetting I can replace plants *facepalm*
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Da shovel is your friend. :D
<Klumzeedragon> Just make your own Phase4?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also that final boss was nice, not too easy, not too hard
<Phase4> 00,02Klumzeedragon, my vps's are still down
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, I really like the final boss.
<Phase4> 00,02hence why no berrypunch
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: He was a pain in the butt at first, but once I figured out what I was supposed to be doing, it was fun.
<Klumzeedragon> Ah... Makes sense. :)
<Moopy> Phase4 what the hell was that slide thing you just did?
<AdamTheDuck> Moopy, surf maps?
<Moopy> oh
<MadSurge> I was like "aha, freeze! Burn! The asskicking has been doubled!" :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also. Rake. Always. Buy. The rake.
<AdamTheDuck> Applejack witha violin <3
<Moopy> Hmmm this is a good song phase4
<Klumzeedragon> These are so weird. I havent joined any random servers like that before. I've only played the multiplayer and mvm. XD;
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but it just takes out one zombie in three stages :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: So?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: You can buy it again
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: After third turn, just buy it again.
<Phase4> 00,02Moopy, its called surfing
<Phase4> 00,02and yeah, its a nice song
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: More time to set yourself up at the beginning of a stage.
<Moopy> cool
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's like having a free potato mine at the beginning of the stage.
<therainbowvortex> night evrypony ive gota go runing tomorow
<Klumzeedragon> Night therainbowvortex! :)
<Phase4> 00,02really need a mouse for this
<Klumzeedragon> Phase4, What is this? Don't touch the floor?
<Phase4> 00,02Klumzeedragon, its surfing
<Phase4> 00,02bit more advance than i'm used to
<Klumzeedragon> Ah. I havent seen you get to a surfing part yet, else I would have known. :D
<Wrek> 05and home
<Wrek> 05yay
<Ninjazz> Hey, Wrek.
<Ninjazz> Hello, everyone btw.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Welcome home and back~ :P
<Klumzeedragon> Hey Ninjazz. :)
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<MadSurge> Wrek and Ninjazz: hello!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also I should sell my plants more :O
<Klumzeedragon> That /robot. :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I always sell my garden plants after they give me diamonds. After that they're not worth keeping.
<Ninjazz> Plants Vs. Zombies?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also, they sell for quite a bit when they're full grown. =)
<MadSurge> He's going to gut me like a cornish...?
<Gold_Demona> Ninjazz: Yup
<Ninjazz> Aha. Thought so.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Cornish Game Hen I assume
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: 8000$ is niiice
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I know, right?
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma wait this map out
<Phase4> 00,02cannot do it
<MadSurge> :O trying out imitater sunflower
<Ninjazz> Oh. Dis Phasestream.
<MadSurge> What is the point of this map?
<Klumzeedragon> You gave it a damn good shot though Phase4. :)
<Jmo> o.o
<Ponies47> Good morning everypony :)
<Klumzeedragon> Morning Ponies47, :)
<Ninjazz> Hey, Ponies47.
<MadSurge> These maps are dumb...
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ponies47
<Klumzeedragon> Phase4: Dat's right. You cover that boxxy with awesome Derpy.
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: Ikr
<AdamTheDuck> Hey Phase4 can I link a song? :3
<MadSurge> EVERYONE DED :D
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, sure
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6eO_PbzP2k
<MadSurge> RD HAT STEALER D:<
<AdamTheDuck> Yay for Australian bands
<Klumzeedragon> Phase4: And when you get a chance to look through those mods, I think you might like the Derpy Scout one. :D
<Phase4> 00,02DERPYSCOUT
<Phase4> 00,02: D
<Klumzeedragon> And Pyro Pie is pretty entertaining. :P
<DashWithRainbows> I wonder what the audio files for Derpy scout would be
<DashWithRainbows> Probably fan made ones.
<Ninjazz> inb4 they change her voice files.
<thegt90> night guys got to get up early for dentist
<Klumzeedragon> Nah... He has the same voice files.
<Ponies47> Night thegt90
<DashWithRainbows> I wish there were sound files for the Celestia sniper
<DashWithRainbows> Having the Celestia skin with Sniper's voice just seems weird.
<Klumzeedragon> DashWithRainbows: So true. :D But same with Luna Sniper or Twi Sniper.
<Ponies47> Which reminds I gotta start downloading pony mods for my TF2 :p
<DashWithRainbows> Meh, I prefer the princesses to be the sniper over Twilight.
<DashWithRainbows> Not good when it comes to PF2 server.
<Ninjazz> That'll be ALOT of fan VA work.
<DashWithRainbows> Seeing that the princess heroes are the same skin as the princess sniper skin, I always get confused.
<seatsea> hi everypony
<Ninjazz> Hello, seatsea.
<Ponies47> Hi seatsea
<Klumzeedragon> DashWithRainbows: Ah. I only like his twi sniper cause it actually has clothes? I don't know. The plain pony bodies on TF2 just looks weird to me.
<AdamTheDuck> Needs moar of your music Phase4 :P
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not good at this
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, sure
<AdamTheDuck> me too, I can't even get past the first part :?
<AdamTheDuck> :? *
<AdamTheDuck> :/* lol
<Ninjazz> Dat same derp.
<Klumzeedragon> Damn. 30 minutes a map seems a little extreme.
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, another song because there's no music :<
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGv37zA_7qw
<Phase4> 00,02i was waiting for you to post one :P
<AdamTheDuck> Oh I left you to chose the music :D
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 sad song :/
<Ponies47> This server looks so confusing 6_9
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies47, it's a surfing server
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: I suck at those :/
<AdamTheDuck> So Phase4, it's ok if I post a link at the end of each song until told otherwise? :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies47, maybe it's because you don't really know how to play it?
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, sure
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjPb2HJl0Co
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah. Guess so.
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjPb2HJl0Co
<DashWithRainbows> Oh, didn't know that Twi sniper was released.
<DashWithRainbows> better download it because reasons <_< >_>
<AdamTheDuck> Dat delayed stream :D
<Klumzeedragon> DashWithRainbows: :P Reasons!
<DashWithRainbows> My reasons are second best reasons.
<Klumzeedragon> Fair enough! :D
<Ninjazz> Suspicious reasons.
<Klumzeedragon> Getting better Phase4. :)
<Phase4> 00,02Klumzeedragon, ^_^

<AdamTheDuck> Lovely voice though
<Klumzeedragon> AdamTheDuck: I like oasis more for that type of music though. :D
<Klumzeedragon> I don't see how you're supposed to get passed that last part you keep getting stuck at...

<Klumzeedragon> Nope. Just Scout. Sniper. Pyro. and Demoman so far.
<DashWithRainbows> I'd prefer the soldier to be Shining Armour.
<DerpDash> Darn too bad i couldnt join the server :I
<DashWithRainbows> He suits it more than Spike.
<Klumzeedragon> Scout has like 4 skins. And Sniper has like 3. :D
<DashWithRainbows> Pinkie Pyro... One of my favourites so far.
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: Yes. Caramel did finish Heavy Rain by the way.

<Phase4> 00,02skyrim is a platformer right?
<Ninjazz> Lolno.
<Klumzeedragon> Best platformer. :P
<Ninjazz> It's a Space Oddesey Oprah MMORPG.
<Ninjazz> Opera*
<Ninjazz> Oprah...
<DerpDash> ^^
<Klumzeedragon> I like the Oprah better.
<Bronysith> and suddenly most overrated game on stream
<Bronysith> of 2011
<DerpDash> ikr?
<Klumzeedragon> Makes me want to play my Skyrim... I'll do it tomorrow. For now, I sleep. It's 4:35am. :P
<Klumzeedragon> Bronysith: Maybe overrated. Still good. :D
<Bronysith> Klumzeedragon: not really
<Klumzeedragon> Far from best but good. :D Opinions is opinions though.
<Bronysith> *are
<Klumzeedragon> Nope. Is.
<Bronysith> and it is not an opinion, skyrim IS friggin overrated
<Klumzeedragon> I said what I meant and I meant what I said.
<DerpDash> OmG Avast Your Ass Remix tiem
<Klumzeedragon> And I agreed, no? It is overrated. It's not a bad game though.
<AdamTheDuck> so many yays :D
<Bronysith> fallout is a far better game
<Klumzeedragon> Bronysith: Not arguing there.
<Bronysith> skyrim is just so boring and repettive and not immersive whatsoever
<Bronysith> and i am talking about fallout 1 and new vegas
<Ninjazz> It has it's moments.
<Bronysith> i love fallout 1 and new vegas
<cachi01|phone> G2G to school everypony. Cya :)
<Bronysith> fallout 3 was good though, i just enjoy new vegas better
<DerpDash> :3 D'aww Flutters so happeh
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: Have fun. :)
<Ninjazz> Cya, cachi01|phone. Take care.
<Ponies47> Bye cachi01|phone

<Phase4> 00,02thats not working
<DerpDash> ragdolls
<Klumzeedragon> Bronysith: Exactly what Im saying with Skyrim. Good, but tons of things are better. I prefer most of my N64 games over it, still good. :D
<DerpDash> skyrim facepalms
<DerpDash> EVERYWHERE
<AdamTheDuck> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Klumzeedragon> Spaaaaaaaace
<Bronysith> fallout 1 is probably the most immersive game i have played besides amnesia
<DerpDash> Bye Everypony! I miss ur faces already :'(
<AdamTheDuck> Bye DerpDash
<AdamTheDuck> brb~
<Bronysith> you can kill everything in fallout 1 with no limits
<Klumzeedragon> Did you get the space core mod Phase4?
<Bronysith> important quest giver?
<Bronysith> killed
<Bronysith> children?
<Bronysith> killed
<Klumzeedragon> Bye DerpDash. :)
<Klumzeedragon> Bronysith: Sounds like Morrowind.
<Phase4> 00,02only mod i have installed right now is the derpy one
<Klumzeedragon> I don't have skyrim for the PC. What does your Derpy mod do Phase4? :O
<Phase4> 00,02Klumzeedragon, horse is derpy
<Klumzeedragon> Sweet. :D And nice knee shots.
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02new plan
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma sneak past
<Klumzeedragon> But right. As I was saying. Bed time. Good night every pony! :) Thanks for streaming Phase4. Next time you're on TF2 we should MVM or Mann Up. :P
<Klumzeedragon> And enjoy your Derpy Scout.
<Prick> Finish Him!
<Phase4> 00,02he lost his lute
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Clumseylizard. sleep well.
<hazard> ello
<Phase4> 00,02great
<Phase4> 00,02the door is on the OTHER side of the mountian
<Bronysith> Nords are probably the easiest thing to kill in Skyrim
<Bronysith> well not necassarily kill
<Bronysith> just defeat
<MadSurge> Ooh, I like that the giants give you a warning and don't just go "beep boop attack player on sight"
<hazard> darn i want skyrim
<Bronysith> hazard: no you do not
<hazard> badly
<Bronysith> not worth the hype
<Bronysith> like at all
<hazard> yes i do
<Kandarihu> Almost looks like he's riding an invisible horse when he jumps up the mountain
<MadSurge> Dat jumping :D
<hazard> :3
<Bronysith> skyrim is in no way worth the hype it gets
<hazard> nah my friend told me some ways ta get ta be best on that game and i wanna try them
<Ninjazz> Skyrim got hype because of one thing. The mods.
<Bronysith> and "ERMGHAERD DRAGONS"
<Ninjazz> Everyone knew that once it got released, the mods will come rolling in.
<Bronysith> psssh
<Bronysith> dragons have been implemented in games before
<Ninjazz> Unfortunately, Beth made it harder to make mods.
<Bronysith> but Everyone creamed their pants when they saw dragons in skyrim
<AdamTheDuck> double mouse :<
<MadSurge> Bronysith: except Fluttershy
<Ninjazz> I was more interested in the trailer music.
<Bronysith> nyah
<Bronysith> it is just the morrowind theme
<Ninjazz> With a Nordic choir.
<Bronysith> it is bullshit
<MadSurge> It spawned a meme that everyone except idiot kids hates
<Bronysith> Skyrim is just one giant meme
<Bronysith> everyone and their mother and their mothers dog knows what skyrim is
<hazard> wow
<Phase4> 00,02i fixed the trap
<hazard> then i have dumb friends then
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4 + not looting everything, this doesn't make sense
<hazard> they had no clue what i was talkin about when i said skyrim
<Bronysith> dark souls is the true game of the year for 2011
<MadSurge> Bronysith: "prepare to die", that's all the meme you need eh? :D
<Phase4> 00,02well i'm trying to get somewhere
<Bronysith> MadSurge: that isnt a meme
<Bronysith> dark souls truly challenges the player
<Bronysith> you are just some unfortunate person in there
<Bronysith> instead of "chosen one, not slay a dragon"
<Bronysith> that is the entire bullshit "story" for skyrim
<Ninjazz> Your first mistake was caring about the story.
<Bronysith> ...
<hazard> i just want it so i can max out some weapons status and randomly slaughter people
<AdamTheDuck> Whaaaaaa, I care about story! :|
<Bronysith> hazard: it gets boring
<hazard> so do all games if ya play them enough
<AdamTheDuck> Heck I even have some games which are just completely story :/
<Bronysith> so what? RPGs are best known FOR THE STORIES
<Bronysith> chrono trigger, FF7, ff6 ff10 had great stories
<Bronysith> about 200 hours
<Bronysith> the games were great
<Ninjazz> This is Bethesda. In today's current gaming market.
<Bronysith> skyrim is just side quests
<AdamTheDuck> "Today's gaming market" ...
<AdamTheDuck> That feeling when you look at society today...
<Bronysith> games today cater to casuals
<Phase4> 00,02what is this i dont even
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6580532992
<AdamTheDuck> Trapped forever!
<AdamTheDuck> Avast me harty
<Phase4> 00,02i'm stuck
<Gold_Demona> The funny thing about our society. We think it changes so much, and in a sense it does, but I recently watched a show from back in the 90s that had some heavy social commentary, and it pretty much expresses exactly how society is today.
<Gold_Demona> Kinda adds another layer to "The more things change, the more they stay the same"
<XAX> le 9gag is way better than le cheezberger XD
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6576525824 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH SO FUCKING TRUE
<Phase4> 00,02HA AH
<Bronysith> that is my fav hunting grounds
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, the what now?
<Bronysith> Phase4: the quarry junction in fallout new vegas
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, oh don't worry, Fallout New Vegas joke
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Gold_Demona> I get the feeling Fallout's another game series I'm gonna have to get when I'm not poor. :P
<XAX> cheezburger and 4chin steal all le 9gag memes
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, eeyup :P
<XAX> why do they do this
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: new vegas is better than fallout 3
<Bronysith> just saying
<AdamTheDuck> Better? But I liked Fallout 3's story more :<
<AdamTheDuck> Liam Neeson is your dad!
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: so? yes
<Gold_Demona> I'm most interested in New Vegas and whatever game Fallout Equestria is based on. Fallout 2 I was told?
<Bronysith> fallout 3 had better story AdamTheDuck
<Gold_Demona> Liam Neeson for the win! =D
<AdamTheDuck> See, Liam Neeson makes everything better :D
<Gold_Demona> He was a jedi master AND furry jesus.
*Bronysith smacks Gold_Demona
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: liam neeson was never a jedi
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Wasn't he Qui gon Jin?
<AdamTheDuck> :< blasphemy!
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: prequels are non canon
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Suit yourself, dude.
<XAX> Guys.
<XAX> http://appft.com
<AdamTheDuck> But... Liam Neeson...
<Bronysith> XAX: oy this is a gift from RX
*Bronysith murders XAX by ripping his soul from his body
<XAX> right.
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Whether they were canon or not has nothing to do with the fact taht Liam played Qui gon. :P
<Gold_Demona> He WAS a jedi.
<Gold_Demona> Canon or no
<XAX> It would help if I knew who RX is.
<Bronysith> he just starred in a shit film
<Ninjazz> RX Sweetie-bot.
<Bronysith> RX-78-Grimlock
<XAX> Oh.
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Your point? It still happened.
<XAX> I see.
<Gold_Demona> Judgey judgemental pants
<Bronysith> i get the feeling that games are just going downhill from now on
<Gold_Demona> Not necessarily.
<Bronysith> catering to casuals
<Bronysith> thats goign downhill
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<AdamTheDuck> ArmA 3 is still keeping me optimistic :P
<Bronysith> nyah
<Gold_Demona> Judgey judgementalness
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' RaveBrony
<Bronysith> i still need to play earthbound
<Bronysith> ill play it after school today
*RaveBrony waves to AdamTheDuck

<AdamTheDuck> RaveBrony, that would be Phase.
<RaveBrony> Ah, ty :)
<Bronysith> Phase4: the puzzle solution is on the claw

<Bronysith> myah
<Bronysith> i need to play earthbound
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: and you need to play legend of dragoon
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Have to take the time to get a working PS emulator first. :P
<RaveBrony> Yeah!
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I R lazy
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: legend of dragoon is an awesome cult classic
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: So I hear
<XAXaphone> Working PS emulator?
<Bronysith> i kind of wish Dragoon sold better
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Phase4> 00,02and then i died
<Bronysith> but not at the same time
<XAXaphone> Playstation?
<XAXaphone> ePSXe.
<Phase4> 00,02failed so hard skyrim crashed
<AdamTheDuck> did you save the game Phase4 ? :D
<Bronysith> because then it would be too overhyped like FF7 which is still good
<Gold_Demona> XAXphone Yeah, it's just a pain to get it working right
<Phase4> 00,02which is aparently not very hard at all
<RaveBrony> Lol, Phase4 :D
<AdamTheDuck> Crashed? Haha :D
<XAXaphone> Gold_Demona: ...true. You have no idea how long I spent fishing for working, decent plugins.
<Gold_Demona> There's no automaticness like there is with cartridge emulators
<Ponies47> Pretty much suck at all games :<

<AdamTheDuck> I have no idea what Phase is building his character into other than mage
<RaveBrony> Lol
<RaveBrony> I completely neglected mage.
<AdamTheDuck> Mage yet he put a point into bow :/
<Bronysith> should i get devil may cry 3?
<RaveBrony> Never played devil may cry :o
<AdamTheDuck> ^ me too :/

<Bronysith> so i shall get it
<Ponies47> Well time for school/ No pony know's what is going to happen today. For someone saw me wearing my brony wristband and started spreading it around the freakin school trying to see if they could figure it out. :/
<AdamTheDuck> Well have fun at school Ponies47
<AdamTheDuck> Frankly no one cares I'm a brony at my school :$
<hazard> dude at my school if i say im a brony i get killed im dead serious
<Ponies47> hazard: Oh come on it can't be that bad
<Ninjazz> Somehow, my friend freaked out when he saw my Desktop Ponies.exe on my desktop.
<RaveBrony> Good luck, Ponies47!
<Ninjazz> mfw. ._.
<Prick> Phase4: there was a hidden door that led outside
<Prick> plus a chest
<Phase4> 00,02Prick, also it was hidden
<Phase4> 00,02and thus i could not see it
<RaveBrony> :D
*Ponies47 Hugs RaveBrony "I'm gonna need that"

<Bronysith> on fire
*Ponies47 Puts himself out
<hazard> cya Ponies47
<Ninjazz> RaveBrony, I had no ponies on my desktop. He just saw the .exe on my desktop.
*Ponies47 Throws Bronysith into the river
<XAXaphone> I had a friend over a while back that had just come back from Australia for a few weeks. He came over and saw my wallpapers, and didn't mention it once.
<Ninjazz> AFTER he saw it, we went through the list and got some ponies.:D
<XAXaphone> All the not caring.
<RaveBrony> Ninjazz: Oh, haha :P
<Wrek> 05so i reworked my desktop today
<Ponies47> Bye!
<RaveBrony> Oh? :o
<AdamTheDuck> ohai Wrek
<Ninjazz> Wrek, organizing is always fun.

<Bronysith> oh hey Wrek didnt know you were here
<Ninjazz> XAXaphone, could be worse.
<Prick> Phase4: my dad taught me sumthin new when ever i play game, gotta look in every nook and crany to find the goodies
<AdamTheDuck> Skyrim mountain surfing to epic music :D
<Wrek> 05lemme screenshot it

<Bronysith> Wrek: what did yhou do to your desktop? mod the crap out of it?
<RaveBrony> I always look everywhere in games. :$
<Bronysith> i just burn everything
<RaveBrony> Most of the time i find nothing tho.... haha
<XAXaphone> Ninjazz: Explain how. He also saw my RD boot screen.
<Ninjazz> XAXaphone, he could have /cared/. Then again, he could have been happy about it too.
<Bronysith> grrr, i need chrono trigger
<AdamTheDuck> Derpy!~
<Prick> my favorite mlp mods are the City Shields
<Ninjazz> I put one wallpaper on a computer no really uses and everyone freaks out. -_-
<AdamTheDuck> So what 'type' of games do you like Bronysith?
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: good games
<pony_4126> ARROW TO THE KEEN
<AdamTheDuck> That's a very general answer, good can be interpreted many ways by different people
<pony_4126> KNEE*
<Bronysith> Final fantasy 7,6 and chrono trigger are my favorite game AdamTheDuck
<Bronysith> they tied for first
<hazard> coulda been worse
<hazard> coulda been to the spleen
<Bronysith> or the femur
<Bronysith> broken femur is the worst pain
<RaveBrony> ._.
<hazard> huh my grandpa brok his femur
<Bronysith> it is funny cause max payne and the courier both got shot in the head
<Bronysith> then they get revenge and such
<Bronysith> but a nord in skyrim gets an arrow in the knee
<Bronysith> and gives up on life
<Wrek> 05http://i.imgur.com/0pYNh.jpg
<RaveBrony> Yep
<hazard> wow then that nord wasnt realy a great adventurer

<TheDamShadow01> :p
<Alchemist> hai guise
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Alchemist
<AdamTheDuck> Man I'm sleepy, I'm heading to bed. Night guys. :)
<Alchemist> good night!
<Phase4> 00,02where do i find an alchemist?
<Alchemist> Phase4: um, right here?
<TheDamShadow01> noo i the game
<Phase4> 00,02o_O
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, http://www.neoseeker.com/forums/52479/t1699763-to-sell-dragon-scales-dragon-bones/
<Alchemist> Phase4: for selling stuff, its near the general store at whiterun
<TheDamShadow01> y´p
<AdamTheDuck> "IF you put enough perks in speechcraft" right...
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Alchemist> Phase4: next to belethor's store at the market, near the well/market area at whiterun
<Phase4> 00,02it says keep and make armour
<AdamTheDuck> Forgot to read that part
<otakon> Phase4: keep what?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm trying to get 500 gold
<Phase4> 00,02otakon, dragon bones and scales
<otakon> Phase4: oh yeah you ALWAYS keeps dragon material
<otakon> Phase4: makes some of the best armor in the game
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, also that's 500 value, that is alot less depending on your speech skill
<RaveBrony> ^
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, i know, its anoying
<Alchemist> Phase4: dont keep dragon bones and scales this early. You wont use them till much later
<TheDamShadow01> i have played skyrim on xbox 360 and i know so much things Xp
<TheDamShadow01> is down
<AdamTheDuck> Well anyway, night guys
<TheDamShadow01> the alchemist
<RaveBrony> When can you make armor?
<RaveBrony> *make the armor
<Bronysith> http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/art/Never-Too-Much-Ice-Cream-326899099?q=boost%3Apopular%20meta%3Aall%20max_age%3A8h&qo=0
<Alchemist> RaveBrony: the dragon armor? When you get max level (100) in smithing
<TheDamShadow01> seach there
<Alchemist> RaveBrony: it takes quite some time
<RaveBrony> ._.
<TheDamShadow01> on the part of the village
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: "have you met my cousin Yggdrasil? Big thing in Sweden. Lots of fans." :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Huh?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: one of the Wisdom Tree's quotes
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Wisdom Tree?
<TheDamShadow01> yep that part
<TheDamShadow01> nope
<Phase4> 00,02where is the general store?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Plants vs Zombies, one of the plants you can buy
<TheDamShadow01> in the right
<Alchemist> Phase4: behind you
<Gold_Demona> MadSUrge: OH, we're still on PvZ. lol XD
<Alchemist> Phase4: it has a logo I think above the door
<TheDamShadow01> ._. XD
<Phase4> 00,02a logo of what though
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I can talk about nothing for a long time :D
<Alchemist> Phase4: dont remember
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I honestly don't remember any of the Wisdom Tree's quotes. I only fed him until I got the achievement for making him a hundred feet tall. :P
<Jmo> O.O
<TheDamShadow01> the left
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<TheDamShadow01> ._.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D his tips are useful though
<TheDamShadow01> finaly
<TheDamShadow01> X3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes they are, and I used them.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Oh yeah, he suggested using two rows of flowers instead of just one
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: VERY helpful hint.
<Alchemist> Phase4: the other logo you saw (the mortar) was the alchemy shop.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Yeah, but in story mode you rarely have the chance to use that
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: better for Survival I bet
<Phase4> 00,02Alchemist, i thought it was a tankard
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Chance? I always use two rows.
<Jmo> Who doesn't use two rows x_x
<Alchemist> Phase4: I always saw it as a flaming mortar :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I tend tp plant only one and put in a ton of plants :D
<Phase4> 00,02this game has nice visuals
<Alchemist> yep
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's hard to put a ton of plants if you don't have a lot of sun, though.
<Phase4> 00,02and then it crashed again
<TheDamShadow01> tip: you can use dragon scales and bones them to create an armor but you gona need to lvl up your smithing to 100
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: You can get better plants faster if you have more flowers
<otakon> Phase4: lower your settings?
<MadSurge> I always end up with the zombies arriving too close to the plants if use two rows :(
<Phase4> 00,02hurry up and sync
<Alchemist> oblivion crashed all the time when I alt tabbed, didnt have much trouble with skyrim.
<Bronysith> oy otakon whats up?
<otakon> not much Bronysith how you been?
<MaxTheBrony> ohai
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's why you have to use the rake and plant either pea shooter or tater mine as soon as the first zombie pops up. And keep planting flowers. And plant shooters or mines as needed
<Bronysith> otakon: good, my first class was cancelled so i dont have to leave for about another 20 minutes lol
<Bronysith> then i just have 1 class and done for the week
<otakon> Bronysith: nice

<otakon> Phase4: you can't cast spells on horseback
<Alchemist> TheDamShadow01: yeah, I never understoidd why you couldnt make dragon weapons in vanilla.
<otakon> Alchemist: oversight or DLC shenanigans most likely
<Bronysith> Alchemist: cause skyrim is an incomplete game
<TheDamShadow01> Alchemist: yep :P

<Gold_Demona> Tovler: Isn't Betty a... woman's name?
<TheDamShadow01> wii u wii u wii u..... nooooo thats not my tipe D:

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Deluxe set it is :3
<SlurryMoon> 03 indeed
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<Gold_Demona> Nintendo Land... best theme park ever?
<Tovler> :( I have to pay more for Black Betty?
<Tovler> Well, I don't want White Wilma, so...
<Phase4> 00,02what if i want a delux one, but in white
<Phase4> 00,02oh neat, dont need to rebuy controllers
<Gold_Demona> ALMOST all?
<Gold_Demona> Which ones don't work?
<Tovler> Wild Wiimote appeared
<TheDamShadow01> trollers XD
<Jmo> Third-party controllers maybe?
<Gold_Demona> He said Almost all games. Which games don't work?
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo, the third party extention stuff was mostly standardized
<SuperBrony64> 11,02$299 for BASIC
<Phase4> 00,02its controlled in software
<Jmo> hm
<SuperBrony64> 11,02$349 for DELUXE
<Phase4> 00,02good pricing
<Phase4> 00,02less than the wii was at launch iirc
<Gold_Demona> That's not terrible for a brand new system.
<TheDamShadow01> :'( deluxe your bad D:
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wii launched at $249
<SuperBrony64> 11,02GAMES :D
<Tovler> pretty sure the Wii was NINJA'D
<Gold_Demona> That's better than PS3's $599
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah, that happened before AUD to USD was about 1:1
<kinixys> No cheering. Everyone is so polite.
<Jmo> I still remember the PS3 launch price here. My god.
<Tovler> professionalism at a gaming event?
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I remember it was YEARS before the PS3's price was brought down to "manageable".
<Phase4> 00,02Tovler, no wai
<Gold_Demona> And I still don't own one
<Jmo> Indeed Gold_Demona.
<Gold_Demona> Notendo?
<Phase4> 00,02only reason i have a ps3 is because its broken
<Phase4> 00,02found it on a junk heap
<Gold_Demona> Heh!
<Phase4> 00,02read: side of the road
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<Tovler> At least US was smart enough to bundle NintendoLand
<Phase4> 00,02dat massive cable
<TheDamShadow01> i wanna buy wii u but.............. no money :'(
<Phase4> 00,02i hope thats a demonstration thing
<MaxTheBrony> Anyone , does this pose look retarded? http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/art/Riven-WIP2-326934616?ga_submit=10%3A1347545150 if you dont care , dont click this :)
<TheDamShadow01> gona see if a get money at Nov 18
<Tovler> I just spent 350 fixing my car :(
<Phase4> 00,02this will be interesting
<Tovler> Beats the hell out of WiiSports
<Phase4> 00,02its like multiplayer except no one can complain about peaking
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I need to freeze myself for the new Wii U...66 days is just too long >>
<Gold_Demona> This gamepad thing is probably the most interesting gimmick Nintendo's come up with yet.
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, i think its less 'most interesting' and more 'most usefull'
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Which is WHY it's more interesting.
<Phase4> 00,02gona make cross platform stuff interesting though
<Tovler> They still haven't given a price on the Gamepad alone.
<Phase4> 00,02Tovler, sb quoted one earlier
<Phase4> 00,02$170 iirc
<Gold_Demona> Why would the gamepad be alone?
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, i think you can attach two
<Gold_Demona> Ah
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But that's for Japan, Japan always gets gyped out on conversions
<Tovler> Eventually, the WiiU will support 2 of 'em
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I say it'll cost $100 in the US
<Jmo> o.o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02For the love Nintendo, just show me Black Ops II running on the console XD
<Phase4> 00,02this looks like the same engine as mario galaxy
<Tovler> And I have to buy Black 2, Code of Princess, and Paper Mario 3D.
<Phase4> 00,02which is good, that was a suprisingly good engine
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wii U comes out in Europe on Novemeber 30th!
<Saturn> 08,01dooo doo doooooo

<Tovler> So, just Lego City, NL, and NSMBU?
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<MadSurge> How can you NEVER touch the ground? CHEATERS
<SlurryMoon> 03 Well, he's only talking about Lego City because it's published by Nintendo
<Phase4> 00,02o_O
<SlurryMoon> 03 I'm pretty sure the 3rd party titles are coming up
<Phase4> 00,02>Nintendo
<Phase4> 00,02>3rd party
<Phase4> 00,02O_o
<MadSurge> Give us more Treasure games!
<SlurryMoon> 03 I mean the "published by 3rd party" are coming up
<Tovler> like Code of Princess?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02inb4 heart sensor
<SlurryMoon> 03 or I dont' know, whatever
<Phase4> 00,02blivingroom
<SlurryMoon> 03 I play mine in the Bathroom

<Gold_Demona> PFFF
<Gold_Demona> TVii
<TheDamShadow01> ohhhh orly?
<Tovler> inb4 sued by Apple for Apple TV
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This seems like what they are doing in Japain
<Ninjazz> Ohgawd that is a terrible pun.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Japan*
<Ninjazz> Dat JaPAIN.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:3
<Ninjazz> o u x3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wow
<kinixys> I hope you can change those icons, cause I would turn the football into a controller.
<Tovler> I'm glad they didn't show this at e3 or I would have had to set fire to something.
<Gold_Demona> Oooh!
<TheDamShadow01> boring
<Gold_Demona> I'm liking the football features
<Gold_Demona> My husband would LOVE that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nintendo is infringing on the copyright of the Vii
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SUE EM
<Tovler> smart phones have been doing that for a while
<Phase4> 00,02i like how they pop the ii in
<Phase4> 00,02like its a joke
<Phase4> 00,02its funny
<Gold_Demona> They're nice and comfy
*SuperBrony64 glomps Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs SuperBrony64 back
<Phase4> 00,02those chairs dont look comfy, and i know chairs
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02As soon as this is over, I'm going to try and preorder this system at GameStop :I
<Tovler> ffffff… I'll get one next spring.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Also, yes, I would watch My Little Pony on the Wii U :3
<Phase4> 00,02i'll get one when my wii stops being funn
<Jmo> Buy Wii U just to watch MLP.
<Jmo> HUZZAH~
<TheDamShadow01> yeah
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wii is still fun...which is why the Wii U includes backwards compatibility :)
<Gold_Demona> This is actually a good selling point for me.
<Dragonmatte> Ponies on wii u? :O
<TheDamShadow01> MLP :)
<Dragonmatte> Might just be worth it xD
<kinixys> I'll buy if we get a good MLP game on wiiu.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02BREAKING: Reggie likes Breaking Bad :3
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, backward compatible to gamecube as well?
<Phase4> 00,02probably not
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Phase4: No :<
<SlurryMoon> 03 only wii
<Tovler> if only Reggie said I'm a big My Little Pony fan
<TheDamShadow01> nope
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 people hack it in
<TheDamShadow01> just wii
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wii games won't be upscaled on the new system >>
<Tovler> Reggie also likes NBC's Revolution.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02As long as the system plays Netflix, I'm good on TV content :)
<Gold_Demona> Me too
<TheDamShadow01> yep me too
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, depending on how nintendo responds, that might be possible to softmod in
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But that tune in option on TV is pretty awesome
<Phase4> 00,02homebrew channel on the wii is prety nice
<MadSurge> Tovler: we still have Andrew W. K. :$
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Phase4: It's already confirmed to have Netflix
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, i ment the upscaling
<Phase4> 00,02and to a lesser extent gamecube compatability, which would be possible for someone clever to do with relitive ease
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I somehow doubt this thing will be as easily hackable as the Wii :o
<Tovler> hmm, Rango can be picked for A movie
<Gold_Demona> I REALLY like the sports option.
<Phase4> 00,02hopefully
<TheDamShadow01> yep
<Phase4> 00,02the wii's security bugs were prety funny
<Phase4> 00,02(difference betwene strncmp and memcmp and stuff like that)
<TheDamShadow01> lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What I was hoping for was 'Reggie Reccommends: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic' :3
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Jmo> >.>
<Tovler> I'm mildly pleased at seeing Sandlot
<TheDamShadow01> >.>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So yeah, screw the iPhone 5, Nintendo owns :3
<Ninjazz> Oh. Speaking of phones, I just got a smart phone. Sorta yay.

<Phase4> 00,02bundling with a game is the best way to sell a console
<SuperBrony64> 11,02If this had come out in 2006, Nintendo would have been WAAAAAAAY ahead of the curve.
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, so far ahead infact that the silicon would not be practical yet :P
<SlurryMoon> 03 also would have been millenia more expensive
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:P
<Lil_B> Phase4 yes, to quote Reggie 2011 "If it's true, that Software sells Hardware, than nobody sold as much consoles as Mario"
<Tovler> (I had 300 dollars ready! F*** my car!)

<otakon> Phase4: don't even need to hook it up to a TV
<Phase4> 00,02otakon, i think thats whats happening
<Lil_B> otakon again... it's a freaking 360p Video yes, the textures looks bad this way, but I will NOT judge something I haven't see myself in the grafics they are supposed to have... in short... I jusge it when I see it in 1080p
<SuperBrony64> 11,02KILL CAM :D
<otakon> Lil_B: THIS GAME looks like 360 games
<Tovler> "on a nintendo platform" That's not a glowing compliment
<otakon> Lil_B: THOSE games looked like PS2 games
<Phase4> 00,02weaponized quad rotor
<otakon> Lil_B: THIS is the level of difference between those pieces of monkey shite and this
<Tovler> LEVERAGE
<otakon> I bet you don't even NEED a TV for the WiiU
<Dark_Horst> are they actually trying to tell us that choosing your loadout is NEW??
<SuperBrony64> 11,02YES
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Thanks for Wii Remote support :3
<Lil_B> otakon it WAS a 360 Gamer, and you can't talk about 720p and 1080 p textures on a 360p Video
<Ihop> classic levrage
<Lil_B> Game*
<otakon> Lil_B: listen, those games earlier looked like shit, this does not. Graphically I mean.
<flutterchu> oh yeah 2 zeprete fullsreenz
<Tovler> local multiplayer would be impossible without Wii Remote support
<Lil_B> otakon ok
<otakon> I wonder how much the controllers will coast
<otakon> *cost
<otakon> 100 bucks a pop I say
<otakon> anyone?
<Ihop> whats the point of even useing the tv
<otakon> HELLO?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I love you Nintendo ;~;
<Tovler> Singapore. That map sure looked exotic
<otakon> Ihop: so you can use the controller for sub menus and other stuff
<Lil_B> Tovler well, the WiiU can use 2 Gamepads at once, but the Framerate will drop from 60 to 30fps, but Nintendo said they only did this because people where demanding it, it is planned as only 1 Gamepad per system
<otakon> full epic singleplayer
<otakon> 4 hours
<otakon> ofc the zombies
<Jmo> Zombies reveal. Wtb.
<Lil_B> "1 full Activision singleplayer campaint"... yeah... sure
<Phase4> 00,02just checked wiki, you can attach two gamepads
<otakon> STOP RELEASING THE SAME GAME UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME YOU CHEAP FUCKS!
<Tovler> hm, a launch title
<otakon> Phase4: cool though
<Dark_Horst> yeah right, fuck you, suit guy
<Lil_B> Phase4 but the framerate will be split between the 2
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, probably
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Stronger than Zelda launch on the Wii? Explain.
<otakon> BULLSHIT!
<Lil_B> Phase4 no, they said it, it will be like this XD XD
<Lil_B> ... WOW they learned from the3DSs slow start
<otakon> launch releases have ALWAYS been weak for Nintendo
<Phase4> 00,02the only issue i really see with the gamepad is the forced awareness of your suroundings
<Dark_Horst> where's that video from anyway? e3?
<Lil_B> the N64 had only 3 start titles
<Phase4> 00,02it hurts immersion
<otakon> Lil_B: but one of them was Super Mario 64
<SlurryMoon> 03 lol Ubisoft has 8 games x3
<Tovler> I'll admit. I there are 5 must-have games here.
<Lil_B> otakon and waverace 64 + one japan exclusive chess game
<otakon> Tank!Tank!Tank!?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Pikmin 3 is coming :D
<SlurryMoon> 03 xD
<otakon> oh look another Warriors game
<SlurryMoon> 03 Pikumanz~

<Lil_B> MadSurge ok :/ well Retro Studios will hopefully not dissapoint
<Gold_Demona> You can have any color you want, so long as it's black. :P

<mitamaking> I see the buildings flicker
<otakon> I see Jensen and rain
<Wrek> 05yay
<otakon> mitamaking: they're flickering bc of rain on the window
<IshSexiestPony> Bayonetta on a nintendo console, sounds pretty far-fetched to me
<mitamaking> Is it a Heavy Rain?
<otakon> Wrek: neat system monitor
<Wrek> 05<3
<otakon> IshSexiestPony: doable
<otakon> mitamaking: -____-
<mitamaking> IshSexiestPony: So was Resident Evil, Eternal Darkness, MGS, No More Heroes
<Vivix> Hello!
<IshSexiestPony> I just don't see how the sequel could be exclusive could be Wii U exclusive when the original was only on everything but the Wii
<mitamaking> IshSexiestPony: Kingdom Hearts is a good answer I saw to that, FF7 comes to mind too, or Banjo 3
<Vivix> Sequel of what?
<TovlerU> Same could be said for ME3 and ACIII on WiiU
<otakon> Bayonetta 2 Vivix
<Vivix> Aah
<mitamaking> Vivix: Bayonetta 2 on Wii U
<mitamaking> TovlerU: Those are not exclusive is the difference
<TovlerU> Perfect Dark Zero
<Wrek> 05dammit
<Wrek> 05guess im not playing PS2 just yet
<Wrek> 05x3
<Vivix> Izzues?
<mitamaking> Sonic Adventure 2
<Vivix> Se hvor vi vil masjere?
<Vivix> Are you listening to birthday song?
<Wrek> 05hm?
<Vivix> I may have misheard that, when I came in it sounded like metal version of birthday song <,<
<Kandarihu> Nice desktop there
<TovlerU> Admittedly, Wii exclusive Bayonetta does seem out of nowhere.
<Wrek> 05thanks Kandarihu! set it up today :3
<mitamaking> This type of news always comes out of nowhere, who saw FF13 on the 360 coming
<MadSurge> Wait, that's his DESKTOP?

<Wrek> 05wont hang on
<DashWithRainbows> Can't you access Waypoint on PC?
<DashWithRainbows> I swear you could.
<Moopy> For me wrek not you guys
<Spademagnes[School]> Halo Reach had the best custimisation
<Spademagnes[School]> So many armor combos
<Moopy> And no i don't have a PC i have a sony valo compaq computer
<DashWithRainbows> It has so far.
<Jmo> LOL
<DashWithRainbows> >Don't have a PC
<Moopy> nope
<DashWithRainbows> > On this site.
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<alexxm> i don't really like halo but i admit the forge mode was fun
<Spademagnes[School]> Logic
<Moopy> i hate swat
<Spademagnes[School]> The fun of forge mode was really nerfed in Reach
<DashWithRainbows> Swat was amazing in H3
<DashWithRainbows> Nerfed?
<DashWithRainbows> It was improved loads.
<Moopy> No in rech dude
<DashWithRainbows> So many options were added.
<otakon> hiya DashWithRainbows
<DashWithRainbows> The best being rotation lock.
<Moopy> and i hate team snipers also
<Spademagnes[School]> The place had a fucking huge map
<DashWithRainbows> DWR isn't here otakon. Don't know why you're saying hi to someone who isn't at their computer.
<DashWithRainbows> Tsk tsk.
<DashWithRainbows> Hate team snipers?
<DashWithRainbows> GTFO
<Spademagnes[School]> When I got a new xbox I lost my hybrusa helm :(
<otakon> DashWithRainbows: you lie, LIE!
<DashWithRainbows> It was so awesome, only on halo 3.
<Moopy> Yeah its stupid
<DashWithRainbows> Reach human snipers were OP.
<Spademagnes[School]> I got every skull in halo 3.. ALL OF IT GONE
<otakon> DashWithRainbows: akin to a cloth covering that's flat on the ground.
<Moopy> I get randomly headshots out of no where
<DashWithRainbows> Could destroy tank.
<Wrek> 05Moopy: becasue aim-assist
<DashWithRainbows> The only reason why I kept playing Reach was the assassinations.
<Wrek> 05basicalyl built in aimbot
<DashWithRainbows> You could turn off aim-assist I think.
<Moopy> Well i get really mad about it
<Spademagnes[School]> Fire fight online is fun
<Spademagnes[School]> So much chaos
<DashWithRainbows> I prefer with out help when aiming.
<DashWithRainbows> Meh, firefight is alright.
<DashWithRainbows> I wanted one where you fight the flood.
<Eli> heyo guys
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Eli
<Moopy> But i love playing the living dead on reach
<DashWithRainbows> or the Sentinals.
<DashWithRainbows> Oh god.
<DashWithRainbows> Infection.
<Moopy> hell yeah
<DashWithRainbows> All my babies.
<Spademagnes[School]> Ifection can get chaotic
<DashWithRainbows> have them.
<Spademagnes[School]> People shooting other people for no reason
<Moopy> Teh
<Wrek> 05hmm

<RaveBrony> D:

<Spademagnes[School]> Whats the name of that facility map with multiple bridges in reach?\
<Eli> Wrek: ah :) cool desktop then :P

<Bronysith> RaveBrony: class?
<Bronysith> ...
<Bronysith> i forgot to go to class
<Eli> hi Bronysith
<DashWithRainbows> Um, describe it more Spademagnes[School].

<DashWithRainbows> Um...
<DashWithRainbows> I know which one you're talking about.
<Moopy> Well im going to get on my xbox online to check something
<DashWithRainbows> Has a grav lift in the middle of the map, bottom floor?

<Spademagnes[School]> I still think the sandbox skull is the hardest one to get
*Bronysith puts otakon in a devils knot
<alexxm> i'm good Bronysith what have you been doing
*otakon escapes
<DashWithRainbows> It was, only because of the guardians.
<Bronysith> alexxm: college
<DashWithRainbows> but a simple map overload done the trick.
<alexxm> hows it going Bronysith
<Bronysith> fine
<Spademagnes[School]> I read the skull can disapear when it overloads
<Wrek> 05fun-fact: the "skulL" has been with bungie since the introduction of KTMWTB multiplayer mode since marathon
<DashWithRainbows> also, the map you were talking about Spademagnes[School] was called Sword Base.
<Bronysith> funfact, i had chicken for lunch
<Wrek> 05again
<Spademagnes[School]> Oh yea.. sword base can be fun on infection
<DashWithRainbows> i still prefer Boneyard with Invasion.
<Wrek> 05how long untill 1pm PT?
<Spademagnes[School]> I do like that invasion level with the massive covenant tower
<Sumica> 00,10PT wrek?

<Sumica> 00,10hello
<Flyboy> Panda|Drawing: how did you know...
*Panda|Drawing huggles Sumica
*Bronysith puts Wrek in a full nelson
<Panda|Drawing> Flyboy I have been dealing with females for 18 years ^^ so...
<Dark_Horst> 40%cpu usage? where's all that going to?
*Panda|Drawing waves at everypony else.
<Sumica> 00,10Streaming
<Flyboy> Panda|Drawing: D&D, DM's sister, annoyance, *BOOM* no more D&D...
<Dark_Horst> didnt know it takes that much
<Sumica> 00,10takes alot of the systems horsepower to stream and have it look good.
<Sumica> 00,10takes even more to make it look bad
<Wrek> 05Dark_Horst: stremaing in 1080p, scalign it down to 480p. music, torrents
<Wrek> 05the like
<Spademagnes[School]> Which is why laptops do not do good for gaming computers
<Panda|Drawing> Flyboy :/ oh man, when did that happen? Forgive me, I dont follow DandD
<Dark_Horst> all of the stuff
<Flyboy> Panda|Drawing: 5 minutes ago
<Spademagnes[School]> And yet my dad thinks laptops are good for more than being able to move around....
<Panda|Drawing> Sumica not really ^^ I can stream perfectly in high quality
<Wrek> 05it will spike to 70 maybe once i start the movie
<Panda|Drawing> Wrek D: movie? what movie?
<Moopy> Ok i just looked at my halo reach challenge and it said i have to do everything in firefight in matchmaking
<Spademagnes[School]> What a load of bullshit... Laptops are good for web browsing and nothing else
<Dark_Horst> kinda surprised you still have fluid FPS rates while streaming games
<Wrek> 05Panda|Drawing: it will be a suprise
<Sumica> 00,10well you stream good quality Panda|Drawing when you have your art stream.
<Sumica> 00,10the quality drops grealy when you game
<Panda|Drawing> Spademagnes[School] -____- I have a laptop and I game, draw, and everything else.
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai guys :)
<Panda|Drawing> Sumica hmph, good point. I still havent over clocked my cpu though, its on my list.
<Spademagnes[School]> Im pretty sure desktops are more powerful than laptops
<Panda|Drawing> hello MaxTheBrony!
<Sumica> 00,10dont need to realy overclock it

<Sumica> 00,10why dont just shoot them
<Safari|webchat> BTW it's SafariMonkey on here
<Spademagnes[School]> He had the most retarded reason for saying no
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Alchemist> never heard about this movie
<Safari|webchat> Hello GilDash
<Panda|Drawing> GilDash?
*ArcherJoe11 watches with otakon "oooh, I love this part. Popcorn?"
<alexxm> how are things GilDash
<MadSurge> Hey GilDash!
<Spademagnes[School]> He apperently feels he need to constantly watch what I'm doing
<alexxm> Alchemist this films really fameous how have you not heard of it
<ArcherJoe11> sup, GilDash?
<Spademagnes[School]> His reason for saying no before I convinced him was "You can't move it"
<Panda|Drawing> hm... the bane of otakon is clop.... Ill make a note of that :3
<Alchemist> alexxm: there are many "famous" western media that did not penetrate the iron curtain, and now people are not interested in older movies
<alexxm> oh ok Alchemist
<Sumica> 00,10and for those that dont know hogens heros was loosly based on this.....or was it the other way around
<Spademagnes[School]> HOGAAAAAAN!
<Safari|webchat> Anyone else here getting poor A/V sync?
<ArcherJoe11> here SafariMonkey
<Spademagnes[School]> The fact I am so excited for Mists of Pandaria that I'm counting the days till it gets released bothers me
<Panda|Drawing> Spademagnes[School] I'm not.
<Dark_Horst> hi guys, missed stuff, what'S on?
<Panda|Drawing> Dark_Horst Great Escape.

<Alchemist> *you
<Wrek> 05SETI?
<alexxm> how are things Dark_Horst
<Alchemist> okay not SETI, but a lets say a cancer fund
<Wrek> 05and 30 of that CPU goes to stream it
<Wrek> 05to bring u stream
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: program looking for aliens, you can volunteer for their network and they'll se part of your cpu
<Alchemist> I didnt know streaming demanded that much cpu power
<Dark_Horst> *use
<Spademagnes[School]> Again I doubt a laptop can handel most of this stuff
<Panda|Drawing> Alchemist it does ^^ especially for hi quality :3
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: well, that was in the past, now its shut down
<Wrek> 05lets hop this sub file works now
<Panda|Drawing> Spademagnes[School] my laptop does it just fine -___-
<Dark_Horst> Alchemist: bummer

<VenHur> Hello everypony, sorry for missing out Heavy Rain the other day.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya VenHur
<Vordox> Back in the ages of Movies Dialogue, this was a time when pronounciation was IMPORTANT to make every viewer of the movie understand the word. And nowadays we have fo shizzle my baazzle nissle with some kizzle with da hood in the...
<Vordox> You get the point.
<otakon> Vordox: point taken...my nizzle.

<Wrek> 05Vordox: spis as in stove, oven
<Wrek> 05heating place
<Vordox> Aha
<Vordox> Damnit mixup of Swedish/Dainish
<Vordox> <--- How Swedes lives
<Vordox> All peace and stuff
<Kencolt> UNdergarment, at this time, were mostly confined to the upper classes and nobility. The average peasant made do without. INfants were usually just wrapped up.
<Vordox> LOFE and Spis
<Vordox> Kencolt: Yep
<otakon> Kencolt: sounds about right
<Dark_Horst> an unchaste fish?
<otakon> a lute!
<Vordox> I find it interesting about the old classic movies

<Vordox> Quickie Trivia: The last-but-one scene in which Death is dancing away with his followers was shot when some of the actors had gone home for the day, using some technicians and a few tourists as stand-ins.

<Barbetos|AtWork> Or sign up for it and hope and wait.
<Wrek> 05MaxTheBrony yeah the NDA was liften a few weeks ago
<MaxTheBrony> Ahh
<Spademagnes[School]> NDA?
<Shizuka> 13non disclosure agreement
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah Game agreement for Beta testing
<Shizuka> 13you say nothing about whatever the agreement covers, else you get sued
<MaxTheBrony> Exactly
<Bronysith> hey Shizuka what do you think of human revolution?
<Shizuka> 13dxhr is good
<Spademagnes[School]> So basically no talking about the game
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nee! Discosure shrubary!
<MaxTheBrony> Exactly
<MaxTheBrony> you cant even tell anyone that you are playing it
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Kandarihu> So, these airdrops are a new thing to this patch?
<MaxTheBrony> or atleast not official
<MaxTheBrony> nope
<MaxTheBrony> they are and have allways been in
<MaxTheBrony> i think
<Spademagnes[School]> Man they really want to keep this under wraps
<Kandarihu> Okay
<MaxTheBrony> its much money behind this so i guess they need it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bayonetta 2 Awesome!!! Wii U exclusive F**K
<Bronysith> hmmmm
<Bronysith> is resident evil 4 worth buying?
<Spademagnes[School]> Not really
<MaxTheBrony> Y is feet drawing so Hard!?
<Bronysith> i need more opinions
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith you will play it 2 times at most
<Spademagnes[School]> I'm gonna get slapped for this but this makes me think of a suped up Halo
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i take that as a no
*MaxTheBrony slaps Spademagnes[School]
<Dark_Horst> that alser there looks kind alike plastic
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Spademagnes[School]> Well it plays better than Halo for most parts
<MaxTheBrony> You should look at these maps
<MaxTheBrony> they are massive
<Spademagnes[School]> Getting shot out of nowhere needs work
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is a good game but i just borrow a copy from a friend and finish that not lasted enough to be worth buying
<Dark_Horst> Spademagnes[School]: that'S something that comes with gigantic maps, no mistake of the game
<XAX> Morning all.
<MaxTheBrony> Re4 is fun to play with someon
<Spademagnes[School]> Ok.. because I hate it when Im doing somethign and then bam I'm face first in the dirt
<MaxTheBrony> Heya XAX !
<Bronysith> MY ARMS
<Bronysith> THEY BURN
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah that happends when you dont check you surroundings
<Spademagnes[School]> Well its hard to see people sniping
*Barbetos|AtWork pokes Bronysith with a stick
<XAX> MaxTheBrony: Is that you in your steam picture? :o
<MaxTheBrony> Yepp :)
<XAX> :D
<Bronysith> the whole katana art, swift strikes, fast movements
<Bronysith> fun but extremely demanding
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<MaxTheBrony> its irretating that you cant shoot while cloaked in this game :)
<Spademagnes[School]> Man I miss my Hybrusa armor in Halo
<MaxTheBrony> Btw have they done anything to halo for a while now? I meant anything gameplay , cause every halo is almost the same.
<Bronysith> i miss super mario 64
<RanbowDash90> -throws candu and muffins in the chat
<Eli> i got an old N64 right here :P
<RanbowDash90> *&candy
<Spademagnes[School]> How much do N64 games go for?
*MaxTheBrony Picks up the muffins and Throws them back at RanbowDash90
<Barbetos|AtWork> I can't wait till cloakers get their shot gun.
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Barbetos|AtWork> THen I might actually use them.
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<Spademagnes[School]> I have a veritable treasure trove on N64 games
<Eli> Bronysith: you could just get it for wii or ds
<RanbowDash90> hai all

<Bronysith> i have my n64 with majoras mask
<Bronysith> at least i still have my fav zelda with n64
<Eli> Bronysith: well, don't miss it then :P i play my old games on my N64. i even got 3 game boy color right here :P
<Spademagnes[School]> Were all the MM crarts goldish?
<MaxTheBrony> I only have played n64 once :( i feel ashemed
<MaxTheBrony> ashamed*
<Bronysith> Eli: you dont need 2 emotes
<MaxTheBrony> Lol the Emote police is here , ruuuun
<Eli> Bronysith: i forgot you don't like emotes :P makes me wanna use them more :) ;)
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Spademagnes[School]> Were all the Majora Mask game cartridges gold colored
<Eli> Bronysith: i don't usually troll, but here's the thing: How can you NOT like emotes?
<Dark_Horst> kind of confused by the rifle sound. is it surpressed or not?
<Dark_Horst> dont see any surpressors or that
<Bronysith> Eli: i dont mind em, it is just when people spam the fuck out of them, and the :P just seems to be a mocking/sarcastic emote
<Dark_Horst> not even a cat
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Spademagnes[School]> The hell just exploded?
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Bronysith back :D
<MaxTheBrony> I just see The derpy emote as a fun emote :)
<MaxTheBrony> But its true it can be seen as sarcastic
<MaxTheBrony> depends what is written before tho.
<Eli> Bronysith: well, it is. it's the : P < "i stick my tongue out to you, because i'm 11 years old" emote. i love it
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> why NewSuperBronyU ? why bayonetta 2 is wii u exclusive ? D:
<MaxTheBrony> I do that all the time Eli
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: can that rifle even damage vehicles?
<Eli> MaxTheBrony: me too :)
<MaxTheBrony> Dark_Horst: to some degree
<Spademagnes[School]> I decided to not buy a WiiU when it comes out
<MaxTheBrony> but its not very effective
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Because the Wii U is the greatest gaming hardware ever created. Having an awesome game on it just seemed natural :)
<Dark_Horst> loving the pistol
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek y dun you fly some :)?
<MaxTheBrony> its epic
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Also, it's sticking it to those who doubted Nintendo before o-o
<Barbetos|AtWork> Flying is hard.
<MaxTheBrony> I Love flying
<Dark_Horst> NewSuperBronyU: dont hug the cat before it'S dead
<Eli> MaxTheBrony: i don't wanna grow up any faster than really necessary
<MaxTheBrony> It the best flying in game ever Imo
<Spademagnes[School]> Lets hope Super Mario bros WIIU is more interesting than NSMB2
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dark_Horst: That doesn't make sense.
<MaxTheBrony> Im still young so i guess i can use the : P smiley until im 18
<Spademagnes[School]> New Super Mario Bros 2 was fucking boring
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<MaxTheBrony> or if theres a age limit to smileys even
<Spademagnes[School]> Same content as 1 except with shit loads of coins...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Don't jump in the front of a car until it's ready to hit you.
<Bronysith> im too tired for UMvC3
<Spademagnes[School]> Thats not how you do a sequel
<Dark_Horst> NewSuperBronyU: you think? what about guinea pigs?
<Bronysith> lets play a relaxing game of FFVIII
<Eli> MaxTheBrony: you have no idea how old i just felt because of your comment... i'm 19
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Applechip> Spademagnes[School]: i stopped caring about mario a long time ago
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Guinea Pigs eat pellets. I play Nintendo games. Just not the same.
<MaxTheBrony> I like the fat guy D:
<Dark_Horst> hmmmmm
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> NewSuperBronyU but i don't want to buy a WiiU just for a game, make them port it to pc D:
<Spademagnes[School]> Most of the launch games for the WiiU are ports
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02CONFIRMED
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Season 3
<XAX> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> OMFG THERES GONNA BE A SEASON 3???
<Shizuka> 13there is no season 3
<Spademagnes[School]> I find it confusing the 3DS XL is cheaper than the 3DS at launch
<twilight_sprinkle> omaigashomaigashomaigash
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT: PC sucks though so I would be doing the game an injustice D:
<MaxTheBrony> what season 3? MLP?
<twilight_sprinkle> MaxTheBrony: si seniore
<Eli> wut? season 3? is that something like G3?
<MaxTheBrony> :p pfft old news
<XAX> What's this pony show everyone keeps talking about?
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then NewSuperBronyU unleashed the console VS pc War
<MaxTheBrony> XD
<Eli> Ponies? but i'm alergic!
<Spademagnes[School]> Also what was this Ambassidor program the 3ds had?
<XAX> (yeah, they're a day late with shouting about that Facebook post)
<MaxTheBrony> Dont start console war :)
<Dark_Horst> i dont want them to tell me about season 3 I WNAT AN AIRDATE
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark_Horst december 21 2012
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02To have a war, the each side has to put up some sort of fight. PC has nothing to stand on. It's for YouTube and Email. Why would I want to play games in my email? YouTube is for videos, you can't play games with that. Just crazy stuff.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> there
<twilight_sprinkle> pc is better in the longrun
<MaxTheBrony> Love the Vanu fighter ships!
<Eli> MaxTheBrony: i should go and dig out my NES, but i don't think many games still work on that thing... wrestling is awesome tho
<Shizuka> 13don't troll...
<Dark_Horst> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: got that from where?
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Spademagnes[School]> <.<
<XAX> Lol'd NewSuperBronyU
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: pfffft apparently youve never played Call of Gmail 4
<MaxTheBrony> haha NewSuperBronyU :D
<Dark_Horst> becasue "me own arse" does not count as a credible source
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> NewSuperBronyU i'm quite sure there that you are just trolling so i'm not continuing with this convo
<Spademagnes[School]> Yes because 360 is so much better...
<Shizuka> 13bashing PC while supporting the company that's been flogging the same game for over 20 years
<XAX> twilight_sprinkle: 10/10
<Shizuka> 13for shame
<MaxTheBrony> My KD on Youtube is 20+
<Shizuka> 13you should be ashamed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark_Horst .... you did not got the joke
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Okay, fine. You can play FARMVILLE on PCs...
<twilight_sprinkle> XAX: ikr, i loved it. especially the part where you have to write an email that was awesome
<Spademagnes[School]> Flogging what game?
<MaxTheBrony> NewSuperBronyU: we got farmville 2 Now!!
<MaxTheBrony> In 3d!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<XAX> MaxTheBrony: Damn, mine's only around 11.
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: don't troll?
<Dark_Horst> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: seems i didnt
<Spademagnes[School]> *cough* WoW*cough*
<MaxTheBrony> XAX: Im a champion on youtube :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Eli: Eat cookies? Stay in school? Brush your teeth at night?
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: i don't do either...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I brush my teeth with a rag on a stick.
<twilight_sprinkle> i brush my teeth with a stick.
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: i brush my teeth with a cat. The cats have spoken.
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<Dark_Horst> rocket launcher is best infantry defense
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02hai FillyFlam :3
<twilight_sprinkle> goi FillyFlam
<twilight_sprinkle> *hoi
<MaxTheBrony> Heya FillyFlam
<Eli> hi FillyFlam
<Applejack2012> hi
<Spademagnes[School]> Trying to be sarcastic never works on the internet
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<MaxTheBrony> Unless you are talking with skype or such programs :)
<Dark_Horst> landing pods. neat
<Eli> Spademagnes[School]: yeah... i noticed that a lot... i have to stop being sarcastic in RL
<Spademagnes[School]> Woah lag
<MaxTheBrony> I miss Bf 2142 :) but this is a worthy game in that genere
<Dark_Horst> but they kinda go that from BF2142
<Spademagnes[School]> Was that lag his side or mine?
<MaxTheBrony> Dark_Horst: i think Planetside 1 had it first actually
<MaxTheBrony> then came Bf 2142
<Eli> Spademagnes[School]: yours.
<XAX> 2142.
<XAX> What a game.
<MaxTheBrony> Agreed
<XAX> Spent so much time on that.
<Spademagnes[School]> It like slowed down when he was going to respawn...weird
<MaxTheBrony> Loved pod surfing xD
<XAX> Ikr :o
<MaxTheBrony> and crashing it in a car or mecha
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<XAX> Titan mode was where it was at.
<MaxTheBrony> I loved titan mode!!!
<Spademagnes[School]> God I played Halo so much I keep refering to these vehicles as Not-Mongooses and Not-Wraiths
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: possible didnt play that one
<Dark_Horst> put a "." behind that possible
<MaxTheBrony> I havent played Planetside 1 but its what i think.
<MaxTheBrony> I will start using more correct grammar cause i noticed how sloppy my texts are.
<Dark_Horst> did anyone in here play planetside 1?
<Eli> Night guys :) sadly some have school tomorrow
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Eli
<Spademagnes[School]> That sight does not help
<Dark_Horst> that soldier has a stretchy neck
<MaxTheBrony> Night Eli !
<Applejack2012> bye
<Eli> nighty
<alexxm> bye Eli
<Bronysith> planetside 2 just looks so fucking big
<Dark_Horst> it probably is
<Spademagnes[School]> Just how would a console even run this?
<MaxTheBrony> Dark_Horst: Planetside 1 came out 2003 , so i guess they had droppods first.
<MaxTheBrony> Spademagnes[School]: No idea
<Dark_Horst> MaxTheBrony: if they HAD droppods
<MaxTheBrony> Im quite sure they had. TB talks about it all the time
<Dark_Horst> tb?
<MaxTheBrony> about how great the first PS was .
<MaxTheBrony> Total Biscuit.
<Spademagnes[School]> Theres one thing PC games have over Consoles... Memory space for games
<teentro> YAY KILL EM ALL :D
<Dark_Horst> also the option for way more power thatn cosoles will ever have
<MaxTheBrony> yepp
<Bronysith> TEAM FOUR STAR MOVIE
<Spademagnes[School]> A console would not be able to run this with out massive lag and popup
<Spademagnes[School]> I asume the maps are fucking huge
<MaxTheBrony> They are O.o
<MaxTheBrony> its amazing
<Dark_Horst> becasue, consoles? they're designed for a fixed price that as much people as possible can afford while balancing that with power
<Shizuka> 13to see how a console game runs compared to PC, just look at rage
<MaxTheBrony> I can just walk arround forever
<Dark_Horst> PCs? the only upward limit they have is "top tier"
<Shizuka> 13consoles are incapable of using the high resolution textures a PC is, so they had to cause extreme pop-in to make it half work
<MaxTheBrony> Rage wasnt that fun ... I buyed it for 25 sek, its like 2 $
<Spademagnes[School]> You know SOnic 4?
<Spademagnes[School]> Alot of the music had to be edited because of the Wii's shitty hard drive
<Shizuka> 13i haven't gotten past the first building after the guy saves you, the pop-in and stuttering is unbearable
<Buytoast> Ah, finally I have beaten Deus Ex.
<Buytoast> I truly am the greatest.
<Shizuka> 13id seriously dropped the ball on rage
<MaxTheBrony> Shizuka i just came to the town then i gave up
<Dark_Horst> you notice that especially in games that were primarily designed for consoles and then lousily ported to the pc
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Bronysith> Buytoast: deus ex 1?
<twilight_sprinkle> SB64 troll level-100
<Buytoast> Yes
<Dark_Horst> there'S always some uglinesss here and there, humping your head
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark_Horst see dark souls ?
<Spademagnes[School]> The Wii has a super small hard drive
<Dark_Horst> either graphics, or controlls
<MaxTheBrony> Dark_Horst: I know what you mean.
<Dark_Horst> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: nope
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02twilight_sprinkle: I thk dat pc r not kool caue i no liek too ply fram gaem i mean it frm how suppos to kill? wit shuval. NO. u no shuveel it u no kill u has to kno garen. once u garne den u maek plant. i no liek gaem. i play reel gaem. kitchen mama. it fun.
<Shizuka> 13idtech5 was supposed to be amazing because instead of a small number of high resolution textures it uses a large number of unique low resolution textures
<Shizuka> 13which gives it the feel that it's quake with more polygons, the quality is that bad
<Spademagnes[School]> I played dis game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark_Horst actually yes dark souls did not fix anything and the pc realese suffers from a lot of problems
<Dark_Horst> NewSuperBronyU: i have no fuckingclue what you just said, but it sounded trolley
<Spademagnes[School]> Ya dont say
<MaxTheBrony> Dont let them land D:
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperDolan64 wll cnsles get not new, ihve to byu new cnsles for 2 pley nwer gms
<Spademagnes[School]> Oh look a Not-Pelican
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<MaxTheBrony> its A GALAXY!!
<Shizuka> 13you do realize txtspk makes you look like you have severe brain damage right?
<MaxTheBrony> not a Not-pelican :p
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02shiuz y
<Spademagnes[School]> Well the vehicles look pretty god damn similar to those things
<twilight_sprinkle> wre nt brndamged, wre dolan
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka and gives brain damage to people reading it
<MaxTheBrony> When did first halo come out?
<MaxTheBrony> before 2003?
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Bronysith> yup
<Bronysith> way before 2003
<MaxTheBrony> yeah i guessed so.
<Dark_Horst> halo was 2001
<Bronysith> considering the 10 year anniversary was last year
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<MaxTheBrony> true xD
<Bronysith> not next year
<Bronysith> i just wait the day for phantasy star online 2
<Dark_Horst> i cant get over how stretchy that soldiers neck is
<Spademagnes[School]> And I'm not comparing this to halo I just played Halo alot so the vehicles look so god damn similar in shape to those halo vehicles
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But I have to say, taking into literal account the meaning of my words above don't actually equate into something coherent. It takes a firm grasp of the English language to fully comprehend such a broken and fragmented statement. Read between the lines as it were, good day.
<Shizuka> 13a cat walking over a keyboard would achieve the same effect, but you don't suggest cats understand english
<Dark_Horst> go fuck a dictionary
<Spademagnes[School]> Dark_Horst: Or a thesaurus
<Dark_Horst> AND NO LUBE!
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: :D
<FillyFlam> Shizuka: Of course not. Everyone knows cats speak Japanese.
<Spademagnes[School]> Maru is best cat
<Caramel> 2,14 nyan nyan

<MaxTheBrony> Heya Caramel !
<Shizuka> 13gorgeous, delicious, and deculture
<Bronysith> hi Caramel whats going on?
<MadSurge> Shizuka: :D Macross!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Shizuka: You are underestimating the intellectual capacity of the feline species. Do you not know your place human...err...I mean...do you not understand?
<Shizuka> 13oh is that where it's from
<alexxm> how are things Caramel
<Caramel> 2,14 hello

<Dark_Horst> corporal stretchy-neck on duty!

<MadSurge> Shizuka: Macross Frontier apparently
<Caramel> 2,14 it's so odd how whenever I stop lurking, people think I've just come on :P
<Yahooz> some people just dont know the world outside of lightIRC Caramel

<Spademagnes[School]> I dont know whats worse IGN or Xplay
*Lil_B also hugs Dark_Horst
<AJIsAwesome> IGN.
<MaxTheBrony> Anyways , Good night guys see you tomorrow :)
<AJIsAwesome> NIght MaxTheBrony :)
<Lil_B> I stopped (actually never started) to visit these "Game Journalist" Sites like IGN, Kutaku and godnows what
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, almost forgot http://wylfden.deviantart.com/art/ponycraft2-326374633
<thelonepony> night MaxTheBrony
<Lil_B> bye MaxTheBrony :)
<alexxm> bye MaxTheBrony
<Spademagnes[School]> Does IGn actually play the games all the way through?
<Dark_Horst> my, there's a lot of fancy starcraft stuff on DA
<Lil_B> I get al the news I need off "This Week in Games" with LordKat, "Show and Trailer" by Video Games Awesome and the rest off Blistered Thumps.com
<CCCP> hi...
<Spademagnes[School]> If I recall they thought Sonic and the Black Knight ended after the King Arthur boss fight
<Bronysith> and suddenly i hear tidus
<VenHur> I don't think so, IGN doesn't care about games outside of the FPS genre...screw IGN...
<Spademagnes[School]> To be honest I hate fake credits
*Lil_B hugs CCCP
<thelonepony> Hi CCCP :)
<CCCP> hi Lil_B =/
<VenHur> Y'mean like the "Fake Kredits" in DKC1?
*CCCP hugs Lil_B and thelonepony
<Spademagnes[School]> The kind of credits that play and when they're over the main portion of the game isnt even done
<VenHur> One example?
<Spademagnes[School]> Sonic and the Black Knight
<applejack`> derp derp derp
<applejack`> :D
<Lil_B> I just hate these so called "Journalist" on these sites, who don't have a neutral look at things, get their facts wrong and who appearenlty only write Stuff People want them to write -.-
<Spademagnes[School]> You beat king arthur and then after the "credits" you still have 4-5 levels and the final boss to do
<Lil_B> ... I think I forgot my math homework...
<VenHur> Well, in story terms, the Halo series has it's pros and cons.
<VenHur> One major con of the series is when the hell the fight will be "finished".
<Spademagnes[School]> Halo two's ending was lackluster
<CCCP> i almsot got suspended in school for 10 days today =/
<ArcherJoe11> Spademagnes[School]: Halo 2's ending was meant to directly lead into Halo 3
<Bronysith> CCCP: what did you do
<VenHur> However, in Halo Reach, I think it submits the therory that the fight will be finished = Everyone died.
<Spademagnes[School]> Halo Reach if anyone bothered to real the story was a prequel
<StinkomanFan> Alriiiiiight guys! I have just thought up all SORTS of crazy items for TF2
<Spademagnes[School]> It was a forgone conclusion
<Bronysith> ...
<Spademagnes[School]> *read
<StinkomanFan> ...Who wants to help me make 'em?
<CCCP> Bronysith brang a knife to school... its a little complicated
<Bronysith> halo reach was a prequel
<Prince_Blueblood> *brought
<Prince_Blueblood> we don't brang things
<Bronysith> CCCP: why the fuck would you bring a knife to school
<flutter_spin> I played Starcraft 2 with a guy that asked me "Hey, does anyone know when the Heart of the Swarm patch is going to be released?"
<Prince_Blueblood> ask my moron sybling
<Prince_Blueblood> when he was in school he brought a GUN shaped knife to school
<Spademagnes[School]> I knew from the begining Reach was going to end badly
<CCCP> Bronysith just erm.. reasons?
<VenHur> Crazy items, eh? Well, roll 'em out Stinkoman.
*Bronysith uses the magatama
<Bronysith> CCCP: tell me now
<flutter_spin> When I told him that you would have to buy Heart of the Swarm, he replied "That sucks"
<CCCP> Bronysith rather not
<Bronysith> CCCP: oh, lets see
<Bronysith> CCCP: a knife is a deadly weapon
<Bronysith> a deadly weapon is used to kill
<Spademagnes[School]> So is Halo 4 a reboot or what?
<Bronysith> you had the plan on killiing
<CCCP> -_-
<Lil_B> I hope "Planetary Annihilation" will get another 100.00$ in the next 22 hours... for full real life orchestra soundtrack :3
<Bronysith> CCCP: thats what i shall assume unless you tell me what happened
<CCCP> Bronysith ugh
<CCCP> Bronysith why would i kill someone in a public building?
<Bronysith> CCCP: they must of done something really bad to you, planning on killing someone is very extreme
<VenHur> Isn't it an illegal act to bring a knife in school?
<Bronysith> CCCP: TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
<CCCP> okies
<Spademagnes[School]> So why are they making a Halo 4 when the package for Halo 3 said it was the end to the trilogy?
<VenHur> Not to cause an uproar, but...really man? ...Really?
<Lil_B> Spademagnes[School] money
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait a sec
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait
<CrimsonPhoenix> WAAAAAAAAAAAAIT A SECOND
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bayonetta 2 on Wii U?
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix WiiU only
<CrimsonPhoenix> Holy shit
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix published by Nintendo
<Spademagnes[School]> So how many WiiU launch games are not fucking ports?
<CrimsonPhoenix> WiiU comfirmed for top consoles
<VenHur> Spademagnes[School]: From what I heard, Halo 4 is meant to the begining of a new trillogy and story.
<VenHur> *be
<Lil_B> Spademagnes[School] a lot of them actually
<Ryunosuke> VenHur, like a prequal? :)
<VenHur> Ryunosuke: I'm not a Halo nerd, but I kind it's MIGHT took place after Halo 3...
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<VenHur> *think
<Spademagnes[School]> I doubt MC will be in it given he's stranded in fucking space
<VenHur> God, my grammar is not improving today...
<Ryunosuke> oh
<Ryunosuke> that is good
<Ryunosuke> when it said teaser, I was hesitant
<Ryunosuke> but that is actually good
<Ryunosuke> and not s3 related
<Ponyloverforever> Hello! did i miss anything?
<cowvarkian> <.<
<VenHur> Hello Ponyloverforever.
<Ponyloverforever> Hi
<Lil_B> Spademagnes[School] ithas about 20 or 25 Launch Titles, the only ones who are Ports of already existing games are Ninja Gaiden 3, Batman Arkham City, Trine 2 and Mass Effect nad tecnicly Darksiders II, but I think that is to recetnly to call it a Port
<AJIsAwesome> Hi Ponyloverforever :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> like I said in the comment
<CrimsonPhoenix> It looks really good
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it's not show's style
<thelonepony> hi Ponyloverforever
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im still not going to buy a WiiU at launch
<Lil_B> hia Ponyloverforever
<Ponyloverforever> Hai
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] nobody forces you too XD (at least not here)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> 300 is way too expensive right now
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, I'm waiting until about 2 years after its release to buy it.
<VenHur> Pikmin 3, I DO want for the Wii U (Dem Graphics!), but NSMBU and Nintendo Land and the third party titles...I'm not sure...
<AJIsAwesome> I'm still not sure if I want to buy NSMBU, it seems like it's copypasting from the DS game.
<AJIsAwesome> In terms of gameplay.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I heard the first dungeon in Zelda WiiU would take at least 2 hours or so
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: It took me an hour in the first dungeon to realize their was a switch under a broken bridge that I needed to hit. :D
<AJIsAwesome> *there*
<Lil_B> NSMBU ... meh... I wanna see if they finally did something new other than gorgous backgrounds, but Nintendo Land... while it looks really awful and was presented horribly, kinda looks like a really good game when you look at EVERYTHING it offers
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Apperently the dungeons are fucking massive
<VenHur> But the feature to use new stuff in existing games (like the footage from Wii Sports) caught me off-guard...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Nintendo land looks like a good game but it was not a good choice for what to end the conference on
<CK|Catnap> Actually according to recent reports, the Wii U will have approximately 50 titles between November and March. Supposedly. And one of them is Bayonetta 2.
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] they already talked about Zelda on the WiiU?
<VenHur> Still skeptic on whatever to buy it or not...
<AJIsAwesome> I really didn't like how NSMB Wii dragged on.
<AJIsAwesome> PLus, the co-op inthe game is downright terrible.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Being Dicks the game
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Runaway guys and freelance astronauts proved that IN SPADES
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, trying to 100% the game at the same time does NOT help. :|
<CK|Catnap> And on that note, I'm gonna go ahead and laugh at the people getting mad at Nintendo for resurrecting Bayonetta.
<AJIsAwesome> CK|Catnap: IKR? :D
<VenHur> What I wants in a Nintedo press conference: Star Fox 128 (or U) F-Zero ZX (or some other name), etc.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt a Mario game called Mario 128 got scrapped?
<WildRepublicGuard> ello everypony
<AJIsAwesome> For all those people who don't know about the whole Bayonetta debacle, Sega said that they were NOT going to fund Bayonetta 2. Nintendo, however, decided to fund it only if it was exclusive to Wii U.
<CK|Catnap> Sequel gets canned, so Nintendo offers to publish the sequel as a console exclusive, and everyone's like "FUCK YOU NINTENDO". Oh, so you'd rather not have Bayonetta 2 and just let it die? Really? You sound like a really big fan of the game, then.
<AJIsAwesome> WildRepublicGuard: Hi:)
<VenHur> SpadeMagnes[School]: Actually, that game was a prototype feature that was soon used in the Pikmin franchise.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why did sega not fund it?
<Lil_B> hia WildRepublicGuard
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: They didn't feel like it, I guess.
<WildRepublicGuard> hello AJAwesome, Lil_B: how r u
<CK|Catnap> It's also glorious that Nintendo is getting flak for daring to actually respond to people's complaints about a lack of hardcore titles.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I find it weird most of Nintendo's game are based of parts of Miyamoto's life
<CK|Catnap> I'm enjoying the blatant hypocrisy of it all.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> > Gets pissed the sequel gets canned
<VenHur> Having 128 Marios in the game is like Pikmin's 100 pikmins in the game too.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I find it awesome, though. :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> >Bitches more when Nintendo revives it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> LOGIC
<DarkStratos> OHHH HEEEEEECK
<DarkStratos> hes playing STARCRAFT 2
<VenHur> So basicly, Nintendo pulled a smart move by saying that Super Mario 128 is ACTUALLY Pikmin 1, 2, AND 3.
<VenHur> Problem solved.
<DarkStratos> Love this game...
<CK|Catnap> Their major complaint is "oh noes, it's on the Wii U and I don't want to use that piece of shit because it doesn't have any hardcore exclusives".
<CK|Catnap> So, ya know, IDIOTS.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Define hard core
<CK|Catnap> You first. I've always hated the term.
<Michael> ohai everypony :)
<Vivix> So, all in all most people are okay with it, but the loudones don't?
<CK|Catnap> It seems to imply your game is somehow better if it's considered "hardcore", even though there are many good games that I would never think a "hardcore" label fits on.
<WildRepublicGuard> hi Michael
<thelonepony> hi Michael :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fuck does Hard core exclusive even mean?
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Michael :)
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Its call a vocal minority.
<Vivix> So it seems-
<VenHur> Fun Nintendo Fact here, Nintendo was going to make a sequel to Super Mario 64.
*Michael hugs thelonepony WildRepublicGuard AJIsAwesome
<CK|Catnap> SpadeMagnes: It's an excuse. :P
<Lil_B> ok, I'm gonna make my math homework now, calculating curves >.< , after that I'm gonna go to sleep. So bye everyone :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02VenHur: They made a bunch of them so far :P
<thelonepony> i wub hugs :3
<VenHur> And yes, it WAS going to have Luigi in it on the Nintendo 64DD.
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Bye :)
<CK|Catnap> SpadeMagnes: It's idiots making excuses to not buy a Nintendo product, because "that's so childish".
<thelonepony> bye Lil_B :)
*NewSuperBronyU hugs thelonepony "Me too \:3/"
<Michael> GL with the homework Lil_B
<WildRepublicGuard> Lil_B: bye
<DarkStratos> love how we are talking about Nintendo as the streamer is playing starcraft 2
<CK|Catnap> Because as we all know, there are absolutely no children on Call of Duty.
<CK|Catnap> NONE.
*Lil_B hugs AJIsAwesome thelonepony Michael and WildRepublicGuard ;)
<CK|Catnap> Not a single one.
<DarkStratos> just immature teenagers
<CK|Catnap> :D
<VenHur> However, the commercial failure of the Nintendo 64DD make it failed to released the game...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How the hell is Call of Duty "popular"
<Dark_Horst> A DWARF!
<Dark_Horst> THAT IS A CYBORG!
<Vivix> SpadeMagnes[School], old school deathmatch and tdm in a fast package
<CK|Catnap> Well you see Spade....TEAM DEATHMATCH.
<Vivix> It's like playing HL1DM again, just with less health
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I can get that in halo
<Wrek> 05old school?
<Lil_B> CK|Catnap no only Men whos only reson one can't see their manly chest hair is because their manly beards ae so damn long!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> TEAM DEATH MATCH
<Wrek> 05you serious?
<Michael> SpadeMagnes[School]: kids?
<Vivix> some people don't like halo
<WildRepublicGuard> wat is Star Craft
<Vivix> Wrek pretty much, it's senseless dm like old dm games
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: cades to broad masses with simplicitiy.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I got bored of CoD FAST
<CK|Catnap> Lil_B: They're so manly and hairy that they're oft mistaken for dwarven warriors.
<DarkStratos> oh boy..
<DarkStratos> her.....
*pyrocatboy has too much blood in his alchohol system.
<DarkStratos> haha
<Michael> yay, zergs?
<DarkStratos> YAY FOR ZERG!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I find Megaman Battle Network fun...but man it can get dull sometimes
<DarkStratos> cant wait for HotS
<Dark_Horst> the problem is, producing a game that just consists of simple deathmatch, it tends to get some pretty dumb followers. inevetible
<Vivix> I don't like most mp games, but they're fun if you play with people you know with voice
<DemoPegono> Whoo.
<CK|Catnap> And yeah, Call of Duty and "old school" don't belong in the same sentence unless one is explaining how NOT old school CoD is
<DarkStratos> indeed Vivix
<Vivix> I think CoD feels old school, fast, unmotivated, tdm and dm
<Buytoast> Call of Duty is an old game.
<DemoPegono> CoD is kinda old school.
<Buytoast> Modern Warfare isn't
<Dark_Horst> and then BF3 came. and it had amazing graphics. which isnt a bad thing on its own. but those graphics sucked all the kids out of CoD and made them flock to BF. and then teamplay went down the toilet
<DarkStratos> obviosly
<Buytoast> oh, this mission?
<Dark_Horst> THE TOILET
<Vivix> of course, It's a while since I played old games, but I can go straight from opposing forces tdm to cod without getting jarred
<CK|Catnap> Call of Duty hasn't been old school in a very, very long time.
<Buytoast> shit son, firebat country incoming
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Call of duty need to die in hell
<Vivix> Old school does not mean "good game"
<DemoPegono> ...
<Buytoast> Call of Duty needs a hiatus
<CK|Catnap> It's not old school by any definition.
<Buytoast> fixed that for you
<DemoPegono> I like CoD Zombies.
<CK|Catnap> At all.
<Vivix> It is, in mp terms
<DarkStratos> Lol your people are gonna die streamer!
<Vivix> the only real difference is powereups and classes, and lower health
<Dark_Horst> MW 1 was nice. after that, they just kept trying too hard
<Vivix> Try playing Goldeneye mp, seems the same
<CK|Catnap> >implying there are differences between CoD titles
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At least Halo kept MP interesting
<Buytoast> Because they got lazy and reused MW1 for 4 games
<Dark_Horst> CK|Catnap: there are. the perks got more bullshitty with every instance
<Buytoast> The again, you can't profit off of World War 2 forever
<DemoPegono> CoD is just an enjoyable game like Halo and GoW 3.
<DarkStratos> Wonder how a guy playing strategy will work on this, they are either really good, or have never done a strategy game before
<Buytoast> By making games about it
<alexxm> stripporgram?
<Dark_Horst> CK|Catnap: and now they try to promote customisable loadouts as an "amazing new class creator"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God help you if you fight any koreans
<DemoPegono> Like TF2. Just one of the very good MP games.
<CK|Catnap> So basically they're trying to pretend they have RPG elements?
<Michael> less talk, more fight
<Buytoast> gotta love those little talk snippets
<Vivix> Not really
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://derpy.me/f2FNo
<CK|Catnap> That's adorable
<Dark_Horst> CK|Catnap: now, they take ideas from battlefield and act smart
<Dark_Horst> *no
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: :D
<Vivix> If you are going to critisize a game, you should do it because you've tried it and disliked it. CoD is unpopular because of it's fanbase and the curent "realism" high
<CK|Catnap> It's not unpopular.
<Michael> Barbetos|AtWork: dat name
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But brown is real!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> All games should have nothing but brown!
<Vivix> It is CK|Catnap just look at how it's received by "gamers" vs "casual gamers"
<CK|Catnap> It's been a top selling franchise for the last three or four iterations.
<p4ngya> whoever said cod was unpopular
<Vivix> So was Twilight, would you call it popular?
<CK|Catnap> Technically? Yes.
<Vivix> well, LIKED by the general crowd is more accurate- rather than popular
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: tried Mw2. same game, other number. from what i saw after that, the other parts werent any different
<Vivix> because both of htose are popular, but not well liked
<SpadeMagnes[School]> CoD is popular for the morons
<CK|Catnap> If it's selling, there are obviously enough people who LIKE it that it makes money.
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, I've never tried MW2
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Because idiots keep buying it
<Buytoast> Again, they got lazy and reused Modern Warfare for the sequels.
<CK|Catnap> Now the....ahem...."value" of those people's opinions is subject to debate
<Vivix> not really
<Dark_Horst> CK|Catnap: we call that mindless customer zombies
<CK|Catnap> But the popularity is not.
<Buytoast> Because people are stupid and will eat shit up if it has a big shiny 2 on it.
<Michael> CoD just need to stop it
<CK|Catnap> Sales = popularity. Opinions = reputation.
<Vivix> So? Whatever makes money will be done
<CK|Catnap> Do not confuse the two.
<Vivix> Thanks, yes.
<CK|Catnap> Twilight is popular but it does NOT have a good reputation.
<CK|Catnap> CoD likewise.
<Vivix> True
<Vivix> That's what I meant, sorry
<Dark_Horst> and that'S why more devs need to try crowdfunding. if they get the publishers out of their necks, games will actually be not the same stuff over and over again
<Vivix> but the reputation, is it experience or is it bad because of it's popularity?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I hate the utter shit gets sequels but the stuff that NEEDS sequels dont
<pyrocatboy> Buytoast So, the main Mario games are mainly the same, but those recieved well.
<shibaru> Hi.
<Buytoast> Again
<Buytoast> People eat shit up if it has a big shiny 2
<shibaru> C8
<Buytoast> or in mario's case, "New"
<CK|Catnap> Depends.
<Dark_Horst> never cared much for mario anyway^^
<Buytoast> but i still enjoy them
<Dark_Horst> the only mario games i ever had were break fillers on my gameboy
<Vivix> This is an age where sequel is very popular, both in movies and games
<CK|Catnap> Actually Mario keeps selling mostly because it keeps providing a similar, yet unique, experience with each game.
<Dark_Horst> gre out of gameboy 10years ago, so...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And then New Super Mario Bros 2 happened
<p4ngya> i know one thing im buying the hell out of borderlands2
<CK|Catnap> So it feels samey enough to be familiar with it, but it changes things significantly more than many other popular titles do.
<Dark_Horst> waiting for fallout 4
<Vivix> Maybe, I never really liked mario
<CK|Catnap> That's sort of how direct sequels work, though.
<Dark_Horst> rumors are it'll be boston this time
<Vivix> yeah
<Michael> Dark_Horst: want
<Buytoast> how dare you not like Platform hopper Simulator
<Vivix> MIT center of Commonwalth
<Vivix> Not my taste Buytoast, I suck too much
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I love Mario but I hate NSMB2
<Vivix> In mario, I die ALL the time
<CK|Catnap> I'm actually somewhat fond of the 3D Zeldas.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its a copy paste of 1 with TONS OF COINS
<Cades> hey
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That must make it worth buying! (sarcasm)
<shibaru> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mab49cexuL1rywedzo1_500.jpg Look what I got today C8
<CK|Catnap> Because while the core is the same, the world and story often aren't exactly the same thing. Except the OoT rereleases. Seriously. Stop that shit.
<Dark_Horst> actually the mario games i had did play quite different
<pyrocatboy> Buytoast My critisism for COD is that they release them too fast. Eventually, it could kill the genre of FPS's. It happened with Guitaer hero.
<Buytoast> Well no shit
<Buytoast> they keep making lods of emone
<Cades> awesome :P
<Cades> i kinda wanna watch dinosaurs, but idk where you get em :P
<Vivix> money is king
<CK|Catnap> Regardless, CoD isn't even a blip on the radar in terms of damaging the market.
<Buytoast> They need to put a haitus on that crap
<Vivix> True
<CK|Catnap> No, you want to know who will kill the market?
<Vivix> Only people who enjoy it really play it, most don't care about it
<shibaru> My class went to a used bookstore c:
<Buytoast> otherwise even the stupid ones will notice it's alotta the same
<CK|Catnap> Two letters. TWO FUCKING LETTERS.
<Vivix> EA
<Michael> ^
<ekips> AE?
<p4ngya> how does one kill the market?
<Cades> wow
<Vivix> I think Indie will severly damage gameplay and how games are made, but that after the fire there will be better games and stories
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I love how Gaben told off EA
<Dark_Horst> EA? oh yeah, those need to fucking die
<Michael> must protect valve
<CK|Catnap> That's an excellent question, p4ngya
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They tried to buy Steam, Gaben basically said for them to fuck off
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: what did he do?
<Dark_Horst> oh, okay
<CK|Catnap> Here's my answer in a consolidated and crystallized format:
<pyrocatboy> But they made SSX.:'(
<CK|Catnap> Command and Conquer Generals 2
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He didnt actually say it but it was basically the premis
<Buytoast> Sweet is thy girth, my Gaben, my king.
<Vivix> Gabe was angry at xbox because of free DLC forced to cost money, and no direct contact with customers and stuff, imagine his rage at EA
<Cades> i discovered another spyro fangame :P
<CK|Catnap> Would you prefer the long explanation or does that one about sum it up?
<p4ngya> lol wat
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He said he would rather have Steam disintigrate then be bought out
<Dark_Horst> CK|Catnap: oooh, the one they wanna make free to play?
<CK|Catnap> YES. THAT ONE.
<CK|Catnap> I grit my teeth every time I think about it.
<Vivix> Generals 2?
<Vivix> I saw the ad--with the..lady thing
<Michael> or FIFA
<Vivix> and I walked away
<Dark_Horst> yeah, imagine my hype when i saw the first screenshot (frostbite IN CNC!) and then fidning out it'll be a free to play model
<CK|Catnap> Ya know how Spoony's big intro to gaming was the Ultima series? Mine was C&C.
<Dark_Horst> well, we all know what free 2 play translates to in the EA dictionairy. pay to win
<shibaru> I'm actually pretty happy my old the little mermaid VHS broke. Cuz I wouldn't have gotten it today... cuz this one... has a PENIS on the case
<Vivix> I played CnC as a kid too, one of my first games I think- the CnC Demo in 199,,3 or something
<CK|Catnap> Tiberium Sun, specifically.
<CK|Catnap> Was the first computer game I played.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Okay
<Cades> XD
<Dark_Horst> started wit RA2
<Michael> no one played Dark colony?
<Dark_Horst> *RA1
<pyrocatboy> My intro to gaming was SSX3 and Burnout Revenge.
<Dark_Horst> RA2 was the second cnc i oned. then tiberian sun
<p4ngya> burnouts a great game
<Vivix> I think mine was..random amiga and commodore games, and- on pc..CnC, Doom--Duke Nukem 3D
<Dark_Horst> at one point i also had CnC1
<CK|Catnap> So when I hear that my favorite strategy game ever was going to be made into a F2P buy-to-win microtransaction-heavy piece of fucking garbage....I was understandably a little bit angry. :D
<Dark_Horst> i hear ya
<Dark_Horst> loved generals and zero hour
<Vivix> my favourite was Red Alert 1 and 2
<Dark_Horst> refreshing break from the old gameplay while still feeling like CNC
<Michael> need AOE 4
<Vivix> never reaally played generals
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt EA try to copy steam and failed massivly?
<Vivix> Origin
<p4ngya> Origin?
<pyrocatboy> The first FPS I ever played was Turok Evolution.
<Dark_Horst> oh, it's live
<Vivix> BF3 and other EA exclusives are Origin Only
<Michael> yeah
<p4ngya> i couldn't help get it because of me3 :(
<Vivix> I played BF3 for like..4 hours, then got bored of it
<Vivix> aww
<Vivix> I was gonna get ME3 but..
<Dark_Horst> i think BF3 on itself is an awesome game
<Vivix> ME2
<Dark_Horst> worthy successor of BF2
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!
<Dark_Horst> if you ignore the bugs
<pyrocatboy> The first FPS I ever played was Turok Evolution. Looking back now I feel ashamed.
<Michael> Dark_Horst: yeah, it's a good game
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, I think so too, it's just--the players weren't very easy to socialize with, and I got kinda boed after a while
<p4ngya> what are your guys thoughts on Borderlands2?
<Michael> ohai Dark92Enigma
<Vivix> Bought it cause of my friends, will probably enjoy it because of them
<CK|Catnap> But yes, Generals 2 is sadly a strong argument for why EA is killing the market. Pushing everything towards multiplayer at the cost of much or ALL of the single player, this drive towards microtransactions and DRM and other scam works, and the desire to give everything "broader appeal" by destroying what made it unique....
<Vivix> Aww yeah..
<alexxm> how are things Dark92Enigma
<Vivix> I agree with that-
<CK|Catnap> Just imagine if everyone did what EA is doing.
<Vivix> I'm not a big fan of MP, when I buy a game for 50 euro, I want a story, a--feeling
<Vivix> mp don't do that for me
<Michael> it will be liek the E.T from atari or worse
<CK|Catnap> I'm still hoping they end up getting bought out and torn apart. Maybe someone else can salvage the franchises they ruined.
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: that'S what i'm saying all the time. BF3'S graphics whre it's biggest problem. looked so shiny that all the kids ran to it that previously only played cod or css and never came in contact with the concept of teamplay in their lie
<Dark_Horst> *life
<pyrocatboy> I hate ARMA II elitists.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wonder if anyone would hold it against me if I planted explosives in EA's headquarters
<Dark_Horst> i swear to got, some of the shit i saw on those maps borders to down syndrome
<Dark_Horst> *god
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, true- but, In cod, I was able to almost make a peace ring in the center of a map, make jokes and talk to the players. In bf3 I was told to shut up, and in RO2 I got kicked for typing something unrelated to tactics
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Vivix: Stop having fun guys?
<Vivix> yeah-
<Caramel> 2,14 Spade: I would
<DemoPegono> Bombs...
<Vivix> I like BF3, it's a good game, but I rarely play it because it don't make me feel anything special
<p4ngya> that's why i like tribes, seems like everyone's always having fun
<pyrocatboy> Vivix The fanbase for ARMA II is worse.
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: well, it's kind of a sima fter all, meaning that players usually are pretty serious about it. but that seems a bit over the top
<Vivix> Many have recomended that game to me
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma any word on jerry lawler
<Vivix> pyrocatboy,ooohh yees. they're--crazy
<CK|Catnap> Group tactics? What are those? :D
<Dark_Horst> my biggest problem always was that the other players wouldnt say anything at all. tactical understanding like lemmings
<Vivix> hehe yeah
*CK|Catnap loves how people in GW2 haven't been giving him those problems for the most part. ^^
<Vivix> but yeah Arma, I've played that game series since Operation Flashpoint
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh great my anti virus is being shit again
<Vivix> and the game hasn't really gotten better- the sp campaign in arma and arma 2 is so broken that even the cutscenes crash
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It blocked the stream window saying its a Potential Hacking/Computer Crime site
<Vivix> but still, if you critisize it, people rage at you for "not appreciating how crazy realistic it is" while clipping through walls and flying
<Michael> CK|Catnap: what kind of problems?
<Dark_Horst> the fun thing is that event he devs say arma isn realistic
<Wrek> 05thats what i love about planetside
<Dark_Horst> *isnt
<Wrek> 05so far everyoen is nice
<pyrocatboy> Vivix I know! Show any interest in a FPS that sacrifices a bit of realism for fun (IE: TF2) they will absolutely FREAK OUT>
<Dovah> sup everypony? what be the haps?
<Vivix> yeah, that's true Dark_Horst but arma3 looks like it will be fun- and playable
<Medivel> Lollery!
<Vivix> yyeaahhh- they get mad
<Dark_Horst> sure, it'S amazingly tactical and hard, but not realistic
<Michael> ohai Dovah
<Cades> do you think varka whould be a good name for a dragon?
<thelonepony> hi Dovah
<Kinixys> How does one miss an episode of MLP? Somehow I don't remember Hearts Warming Eve. O.O
<Dark_Horst> Vivix: i hope so
<CK|Catnap> Michael: I haven't experienced a lot of nasty people in GW2 so far. People are generally friendly, barring a few asshats (every game has them) and it's rather common to help a struggling player out.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God I hate the anit virus blocker
<Vivix> Yeah, arma can be tons and tons of fun in mp, with good people and good gameplay, but it's not realistic-
<Applejack2012> hi
<Kinixys> Err.. hearths.
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Have you downloaded DayZ?
<shibaru> Yes.
<Kinixys> I'll bbl
<Vivix> yeah, I've played some DayZ with friends, was fun
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: beta phase. everyone is nicer in the beta phase
<CK|Catnap> I had occasions where I got rushed by a few too many mobs, and some guy came along and saved my ass. :P
<Michael> CK|Catnap: in my server i found a lot of RP :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How the fuck did it register this site as a Potential Hacking/Computer crime site?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: becasue the usual dipshits dont care for betas
<Applejack2012> cya
<Michael> bye Applejack2012
<p4ngya> computer crime? they do stream movies here...
<thelonepony> bye Applejack2012
<MedivalPegono> I PURSUETH THE VAST AND BEAUTIFUL LUNA!
<AJIsAwesome> Bye Applejack2012 :)
<CK|Catnap> And I really appreciate that sort of cooperative multiplayer. I don't like competitive multiplayer so much, but co-op? I can do that.
<Vivix> Players being nice and friendly is very important to good mp
<Vivix> coop is tons of fun
<Dark_Horst> MedivalPegono: you might not wanna say vast in her presence, that might end with a black eye
<alexxm> wow those bastards are fast
<pyrocatboy> Vivix To me, people play Arma II for the multiplayer so they can do tactics. (Also the campaighn is buggy as hell)
<Michael> all the army
<p4ngya> Wrek what difficulty you playing on?
<Cades> sick
<Vivix> pyrocatboy, true, the campaign was unplayable- it did not work at all, but hte campaign for the first game, operation flashpoint, and resistance was amazing
<Vivix> so I was sad that sp didn't work-
<Dark_Horst> i bought arma for dayz
<Vivix> but yeah totally, the mp in Arma can be a lot of fun, despite the bugs and weirdness- if you play rp servers or evo servers-
<Dark_Horst> but by now that too is full of assholes and hackers
<Dark_Horst> especially hackers
<Dark_Horst> EVERYWHERE
<Vivix> ahh- yeah
<MedivalPegono> Dark-Horst: Why?
<Cades> this game sounds like its gonna be fucking awesome when its done
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Best Game Ever: Dwarf Fortress.
<Vivix> Haven't played that-
<Dark_Horst> MedivalPegono: when i started dayz, it was lots of fun. but give the players the opportunity to be assholes and they will be assholes. meanwhile it's more of a deathmatch than a zombie survival game
<Dark_Horst> everybody shoots on sight
<Vivix> I am a novel guy, a story guy- I'm not a fan of indie games because most of them just have gameplay- and I'd gladly play through a game with old fashioned stupid gameplay if it had amazing story that makes me scream, cry, laugh and smile
<Dark_Horst> "zombie apocalypse? oh well, let's kill all the surviving humans then"
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Look up Boatmurdered, it is HILARIOUS.
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, yeah, it's true- I mean- it was fine, but then one guy shot another, and suddenly everyone was afraid of eachother, and the super equipped dudes hunted players instead of zombies
<Vivix> Boatmurdered? on Youtube?
<MedivalPegono> Dark_Horst: What thou did ye mean about your sentence?
<CK|Catnap> Dat trident
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Its not a video. All text.
<Dark_Horst> MedivalPegono: wut?
<Michael> lol
<MedivalPegono> Dark_Horst: Thou has spoke of something other than me sayingAvast to Luna the beautiful.
<MedivalPegono> *saying Avast
<Dark_Horst> oh. i read vast
<Vivix> Dwarffortress looks like those early nethack games, interesting
<Vivix> I'll read it when I got some time to spare
<Dark_Horst> you know, calling someone vast might be taken thewrong wy
<Dark_Horst> *way
<Vivix> vast can be taken as "fat"
<Vivix> since it means big, or far reaching
<MedivalPegono> Let us feast on the banquet of many foods, thou brave knights!
<MedivalPegono> (I do my role well.)
<XylemTube> Oh look, it's this game
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Heres one of the lines, WELCOME TO FUCKING BOATMURDERED! Hope you like miasma!
<XylemTube> again
<Vivix> Hehe
<MedivalPegono> Lollery!
<MedivalPegono> (XD)
<Dark_Horst> ..what did that guy jsut do?
<Michael> dat upgrades
<Dark_Horst> flex? or fap?
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Also I've started project 'Fuck The World,' a top secret attempt to funnel magma to the outside. I'll kill those elephants. I'll kill all those fucking elephants.
<XylemTube> This is Jimmy!
<Vivix> Hehehe
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma is there any word on jerry lawler
<Vivix> it's like--a mud?
<Dark_Horst> i liked muggy
<MedivalPegono> ... what is that horrid stench?
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Nothing much, but i'm still praying 4 him........he's still on a stable condition
<Dark_Horst> little neurotic robot in fallout NV. obsessed with coffee cups
<Vivix> but yeah I like story heavy things- but - little of that, so I'm happy with most some story games
<Dark92Enigma> #PrayForJerry
<Dark_Horst> he and the toaster were my favourite characters
<Vivix> Dark_Horst, that robot was hilarious
<pyrocatboy> Vivix Come on guys, we have a nice settlement, why didn't you stick around? Was it the ashen wasteland? The bloodstained gates? Was it the screams of madmen or the stench of death? We've got awful nice engravings of some fucking cheese here, come the fuck on in!
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87E6N7ToCxs <-- New Wreck-It Ralph trailer!
<Vivix> hehe
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Wait, who 's Jerry Lawler?
<Michael> wat
<MedivalPegono> ... * smells fart * WHO HAS DISRUPTED THE CLEAN MERRY AIR?!
<Caramel> 2,14 I don't know whether you're roleplaying or quoting pyrocatboy, but cool it
<Vivix> Quoting, I think
<Dark_Horst> quoting what? boatmurderd?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Former WWF/E wrestler, now commentator
<CK|Catnap> ....got many Jamaicans in space? ._.

<Buytoast> indeed
<Buytoast> NINTENDOMINATION
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: It's better than not being made at all. :S
<Michael> i dont want to buy a Console only for a game
<AJIsAwesome> For all those people who don't know about the whole Bayonetta debacle, Sega said that they were NOT going to fund Bayonetta 2. Nintendo, however, decided to fund it only if it was exclusive to Wii U.
<Dark_Horst> hmm.. looks vintage
<Buytoast> What's this? Disney's Atlantis in Space?
<Dark_Horst> wait.... were those bugs=
<Dark_Horst> oh my god. starship troopers
<Michael> wat
<Michael> the anime?
<Nyst> Oh man I love this cartoon.

<Caramel> 2,14 that makes me sad...
<Dovah> Caramel: I new it look familiar!
<Nittany_Discord> I remember the cartoon Caramel.
<AJIsAwesome> But it wasn't my cup of tea, Caramel. :(
<Dark_Horst> RICO!
<Vivix> I remember almost no cartoons-
<Vivix> I didn't even recognize animaniacs
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: :O
<Wirisme> I used to love animaniacs :)
<Vivix> which is ironic, cause it was hilarious when I saw it again
<AJIsAwesome> So many innuendos they got away with. :D
<Wirisme> Haven't watched it in so long
<Vivix> and..am a big western animations fan
<twilight_sprinkle> the one time "earth to *insert name name*" actually makes sense
<twilight_sprinkle> dat name name
*Vivix pats AJIsAwesome
<Vivix> It's alright, I was outside a lot
<Nittany_Discord> Old cartoons are pretty awesome with content.
<AJIsAwesome> My favorite bit was the "prince" bit. That was hilarious. :D
<AJIsAwesome> I still can't believe they got away with that. :D
<Michael> http://derpy.me/2tA-F lol
<Wirisme> Oh god yeah
<Nyst> Depends on where they were made. Reboot got away with a lot of stuff because it was made in Canada.
<Wirisme> I just remembered it
<Wirisme> fingerprints
<AJIsAwesome> "I don't think so." :D
<Wirisme> That's insane
<Michael> dat giant lyra
<Vivix> Cartoons still get away with a lot, but- not all
<Dark_Horst> so are they troopers or maruders?
<Vivix> I am eh eh..
<Dark_Horst> cant wuite tell
<Vivix> god so distracted
<Nittany_Discord> And Desktop Ponies crashed.
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Take Regular Show for example.
<Vivix> Yeah!
<Vivix> I love that show-
<AJIsAwesome> It's funnny, because I'm using Desktop Ponies right now. :D
<AJIsAwesome> *funny*
<Vivix> a lot of cartoons fall in that trap where they eh--present it as a sketch, rather than a show
<Dark_Horst> alright. now i know they're marauders
<Nyst> Pretty damn awesome.
<Michael> wow
<Nyst> Also look! The exosuits that the movie never showed.
<Dark_Horst> yup
<AJIsAwesome> There was a movie?
<Nittany_Discord> Now they have mechs.
<Dark_Horst> you are a marauder in the game though
<Nyst> There were several.
<Dark_Horst> including that drop
<twilight_sprinkle> 378 below zero?
<twilight_sprinkle> oh wait, farenheit
<Nyst> Was the game any good? I never got it to work on my computer.
<Nittany_Discord> There was a Starship Troopers game I never got to play.
<Dark_Horst> the shooter or the strategy one?
<Nittany_Discord> I remember the strategy one.
<Nyst> Strategy. I didn't know there was shooter.
<Kinixys> Hi guys, AJ.
<p4ngya> i remember playing the fps, dont remember much though
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: Hi :)
<Dark_Horst> you should try the shooter. pure fun
<Nittany_Discord> Those guns sound so lame in the cartoon.
<p4ngya> this music lol
<Nittany_Discord> I do remember that.
<Michael> ohai Kinixys
<Nyst> I can't imagine that a shooter game would be very original though.
<Kinixys> I think I've seen this.
<Kinixys> hi Michael .
<Wirisme> pew pew pew
<Dark_Horst> nyst: it'S not. it's pure unadultered one way elvel nonstop bug smashing fun

<FlutterMEDIC> (\
<p4ngya> i like turtles
<rdibp> what is this?
<Kinixys> Hearth's Warming Eve was great! Adds so much lore.
<Nyst> From what I remember they have non-hostile worker bugs that can dig through rock and grow food inside their body for the others to eat.
<Nittany_Discord> Not going to hit it with that pea shooter.
<pony_8827> nope.avi
<Kinixys> Yay turtles p4ngya .

<Yahooz> Best Villian ever is Captain Quark from Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando :/
<Yahooz> just saying
*Ponies47 Has no idea who Bronysith is talking about
<Wirisme> CJ Collins is best Kefka
<CCCP> Bye bye everypony
<Nyst> Kefka rises above the average villain simply by the fact that he won.
<Ponies47> Bye CCCP
<CK|Catnap> KILL THEM.
<Bronysith> whats that sandvich?
<Bronysith> kill them all?
<Bronysith> GOOD IDEA
<DarkStratos> ok..
<DarkStratos> Trixie!
<Kandarihu> George Soros is a better villain than Kefka... more or less.
<Wirisme> Kefka didn't exactly have to do a lot to win
<Wirisme> but he's still awesome
<Bronysith> he is best villain
<Bronysith> why?

<Bronysith> it was a picture of jon snow as a power ranger
<Buytoast> my thing always gives me that malware bullshit when it comes to there
<Kandarihu> Well, 4chan isn't malware.

<DarkStratos> NEver heard either of these
<Lunac> Love isn't worth fightinng for. Can you pbelieve there wasa General Makepeace in Vietnam? Geeral Makepeace... head of Equestria armed forces?
<Buytoast> the livingtombstone one is crappy
<Quick_Thinker> that face

<Ryunosuke> i have a question
<DarkStratos> those eyes..
<Ryunosuke> about a movie
<Quick_Thinker> now the question is did they actually play these intsruments or did they do it digitaly?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Quick_Thinker, most likely digital
<Quick_Thinker> cause if either one they still both are hard to do
<sub06905> dat gilda
<Quick_Thinker> gilda smiling.... LIES
<DarkStratos> that doesn't look creepy..
<Wirisme> Whatever makes that noise I want it
<CrimsonPhoenix> here

<DarkStratos> ha
<Quick_Thinker> and now its scrillax

<Quick_Thinker> man this song jumps
<CrimsonPhoenix> Philomena <3

<Quick_Thinker> i have interesting story on why it can
<Rustymeat> whag
<Rustymeat> what*
<Rustymeat> Lies
<DarkStratos> this isnt quite the bizzare video or anything...
<Lunac> Masterball is for Mewtwo only.
<JESmith71> Lotto emails finally got sent out a while ago.
<Klumzeedragon> Only fails if you try and steal another players pokemon. :D
<Rustymeat> but you cant even send out the ball
<DarkStratos> should do my little ponybots Caramel
<Quick_Thinker> i was fighting mewtwo in Pokemon Yeloow and i ran out of pokeballs and had ONe left so i threw a master ball AND I SHIT YOU NOT IT FAILED
<Quick_Thinker> he broke out
<Pikachu> Klumzeedragon: With cheats that can haooen
<Kinixys> Oh. I like this one.
<Quick_Thinker> TREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<twilight_sprinkle> are we doing requests btw?
<VenHur> It failed...?
<Caramel> 2,14 the way they designed the pokeball mechanics, theres a .001 percent chance of it failing
<Wirisme> :)
<Quick_Thinker> really
<Caramel> 2,14 true story, look it up
<DarkStratos> lol sucks for you Quick_Thinker
<VenHur> New meme dected: TROLL BALL
<Klumzeedragon> Quick_Thinker: Bad luck on your part. :D
<Quick_Thinker> so i got the most lucky ever XD
<VenHur> *dectected
<Ryunosuke> Caramel, are you good with movies? I have a question for the lotto :)
<twilight_sprinkle> are these requests?
<Pikachu> If pokeballs were real they would fall out the sky XD
<Caramel> 2,14 what do you mean "good with movies"?
<Quick_Thinker> so .001 could i even recreate that in a 100 years
<Rustymeat> lalalal
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: are we doing requests?
<Caramel> 2,14 no
<DarkStratos> dang..
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<Klumzeedragon> Pikachu: I know. :D But I never cheated on the pokemans.
<VenHur> Pikachu: Um...there was a commercial about that...
<JESmith71> Caramel: I'm guessing he wants help in chosing what movie to vote on in the lotto
<VenHur> Pikachu: That was to promote Diamond and Pearl Versions...
<Pikachu> VenHur: this one?
<Bronysith> why is Pikachu talking?
<alexxm> would pokeballs work on humans
<Pikachu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwSD9F_LEmk
<Bronysith> i thought pokemon dont speak
<Quick_Thinker> with the basic system being 0000 0001 (binary it can go up to 164 so that would mean there are over 1000000000000 possible outcomes) and most being the same
<Caramel> 2,14 no non-image links
<JESmith71> Pikachu: No vids
<Bronysith> Pikachu: holy fucking hit
<SpeedyBolt> Because hes tired of saying his own name
<Dovah> why does the tower knight/ penetrater music laugh at me?
<Bronysith> bad Pikachu bad
*Pikachu hits head
<Quick_Thinker> man thats the most luck i'll ever have in my life AND IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
<Quick_Thinker> EVER
<Bronysith> is that tf2 looney tunes?
<Klumzeedragon> Whut?
<Pikachu> theres stream? i dont see it!
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/CkuDz
<Quick_Thinker> man im hungry
<Klumzeedragon> Pikachu: Yeah, there is. :D
<Quick_Thinker> im going to go eat
<Dovah> 9 x 6 = 42 make it work
<DarkStratos> cya Quick_Thinker
<alexxm> you know pokeballs could probably really help out in a non pokemon fight
<Klumzeedragon> Quick_Thinker: Eat well. :)
<alexxm> bye Quick_Thinker
<Quick_Thinker> hold up
<VenHur> Bronysith: Oh my god...YES!
<sub06905> bai Quick_Thinker
<pony_644> why would they make the road runner demo man and not scout?
<Bronysith> oh hey it is valthejeans
<thelonepony> bye Quick_Thinker
<Quick_Thinker> Dovah what you mean by 9 * 6 =42
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU:
<DarkStratos> wtf is this?
<Quick_Thinker> that 0000 0001 thing i did is basic binary
<Quick_Thinker> meaning the coding that tells your computer EVERYTIHNG
<Dovah> Quick_Thinker: it does using something about base 13
<VenHur> Bronysith: Suprisingly, Elmer Fudd perfectly fits the Sniper role.
<JESmith71> DarkStratos: He's doing something with Desktop Ponies looks like
<Bronysith> VenHur: surprisingly?
<Dr_Arcea> hmmm whats he doing
<Bronysith> hes a hunter
<Bronysith> OF COURSE HE FITS THE ROLE
<Kinixys> I recommend I, Princess Celestia by Woody
<Dr_Arcea> or she
<Quick_Thinker> so for instance i want to make a 10 in binary it would be 0001 0000
<Quick_Thinker> a one in binary is 0000 0001
<Quick_Thinker> a 2 is 0000 0010
<Klumzeedragon> Marven is good doctor. :P
<Shamroc> ha
<Quick_Thinker> there is only a 1 and a 0. 1 being ON and 0 being OFF
<DarkStratos> woudlnt that make it 5 not 10
<Shamroc> somepony on stream has genderbent main six desktop ponies
<Quick_Thinker> no it wouldnt
<Quick_Thinker> binary works like this
<VenHur> Someone should make mods and character voices based on the picture, who agreed?
*Quick_Thinker goes copy paste the binary code
<DarkStratos> AGH NO DONT TEACH ME BINARY, I came from school to this to ENJOY
<JRP> 22nd
<Klumzeedragon> VenHur: Meh. I prefer the pony mods. :D
<VenHur> Wait a sec...I looks at the picture again...Daffy's eyes are derped!
*Dovah wonders what Caramel is doing
<Quick_Thinker> TOO BAD YOUR GONNA LEARN
<Quick_Thinker> >:L
<DarkStratos> NOOOOES
<Caramel> 2,14 darn, guess that doesn't work
<JESmith71> Don't scare the new guy away Quick_Thinker
<Dr_Arcea> oh no i have to type an essy and its do tomarow.... well keybord looks like we got are selves into a mess again
<Klumzeedragon> Trying to science, Caramel?
<Quick_Thinker> fine
<Dovah> Everybody may I have your attention?
<Quick_Thinker> i'll leave it at this
<Caramel> 2,14 was gonna have the mane 6 go up against their R63 versions in hoofball
<DarkStratos> lol ya only joined bronystate yesterday >_>
<Dovah> Pi is exactly 3!
<Caramel> 2,14 but it doesn't seem to like using the second monitor

<sub06905> tnx Caramel
<Klumzeedragon> Thanks Caramel :)
<Kinixys> Thank you, Caramel.
<Obsidian> Thanks Caramel
<DarkStratos> Indeed Caramel
<twilight_sprinkle> Dovah: how?
<thelonepony> thanks for the stream Caramel :)
<Quick_Thinker> binary is a an 8 digit system that ONLY has 1 and 0 in it. with one telling the computer to make it ON and zero telling the computer to have a system OFF. also just typing this is a around 500 codes in binary every letter is determined by a number A being 0000 0001
<VenHur> Thanks you, Caramel.
<Quick_Thinker> and there you go my quick cut down lesson on binary
<VenHur> Have a muffin? Or even better, a TACO!
<DarkStratos> lol..
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Caramel
<Dovah> twilight_sprinkle: i'm not an uber math wiz so i couldnt explain it if my life depended on it :P look it up
<Quick_Thinker> thanks Carmel for stream
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: why is it 8 digits
<DarkStratos> so b would be 0000 0010? Quick_Thinker ?
<Quick_Thinker> its the max it can do
<Quick_Thinker> yes
<DarkStratos> yay!
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: what *it*
<Dovah> anyone know how to break 128-bit encription?
<Quick_Thinker> until you get to C which is 0000 0011
<Freefall29> hello everypony
<DarkStratos> why couldnt it be 0000 0100?
<Kinixys> Hi Freefall29.
<Dovah> hi Freefall29

<Kinixys> Stream just ended, Freefall29.
<thelonepony> hi Freefall29
*Bronysith glomps Freefall29
<DarkStratos> ok then..
<Quick_Thinker> Dark binary is a system set in place by the first makers of computers i cant really explain everything
<Freefall29> thanks Bronysith
<Dovah> I will now give the joy of demon's souls to the chat!
<Dovah> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjotdhdBLM
<JESmith71> Heh looks like you're interested in the binary lesson after all DarkStratos
<Freefall29> so how was everyponys day today?
<Quick_Thinker> also there is always a 0
<Dovah> yes the music is laughing at you
<DarkStratos> Random Chat crash..
<Freefall29> black mesa comes out tomorrow.... soooo awesome.
<DarkStratos> Indeed
<Freefall29> atleast up to the xen chapter.
<DarkStratos> quite alot atleast
<Quick_Thinker> so for instance you want you number to be 0 you put in the number (which you will have to learn this sooner or later in math) 0000 0000
<MASF123> I'm new to TF2 PC
<MASF123> Can someone play wiht me?
<Quick_Thinker> now with more numbers comes more results
<MASF123> To practice, learn the basics.
<DarkStratos> ya to practice do training
<Dovah> someone tell me this doesnt sound like that episode of doctor who in the school http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGo5UWO_HLA&feature=channel&list=UL
<DarkStratos> then offline
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/UeOrK.jpg
<Quick_Thinker> 1 in binary is 0000 0001
<DarkStratos> thats a man hug
<Quick_Thinker> 2 is 0000 0011
<Quick_Thinker> sorry thats 3
<Freefall29> so we talking about biniary code?
<Quick_Thinker> 2 is 0000 0010
<Quick_Thinker> yep
<DarkStratos> wait so does the 2nd 1 count for 2?
<DarkStratos> like 1=2 2+1=3?
<Quick_Thinker> im borrrrrreedddd and my C++ is updating so yeah
<Dovah> Quick_Thinker: is this all over a failed masterball?
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: 0000 0100 is 4 right?
<Quick_Thinker> yep dovah yes is it is
<MASF123> No I did training, I did all of them got that achievement Up for Duty
<Quick_Thinker> you are corrrect sprinkle
*Dovah faceground
<MASF123> I mean If I can team up with others?
<MASF123> In a game.
<DarkStratos> could coach ya
<DarkStratos> however that works lol
<MASF123> ok
<DarkStratos> steam name?
<MASF123> MASF123
<DarkStratos> figures
<DarkStratos> same with me
<Freefall29> MASF123: you should get this map for training http://gamebanana.com/maps/107794
<MASF123> I know the name is shicking
<MASF123> shocking
<Quick_Thinker> once you get to 5 things heat up its now 0000 0101
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: so how does this connect to the masterball thing? i got in chat only after that
<Cades> O_o
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: welcome to bronystate
<DarkStratos> that map actually does help much, or atleast to me Freefall29
<Quick_Thinker> im trying to figure out the base number the master ball had to land on to fail
<JESmith71> All of this binary talk reminds me of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc8s3LPehWM
<Quick_Thinker> with each int being a 1 or 0 and binary going up to 164 it can get crazy
<twilight_sprinkle> Freefall29: ive been here for months, i just meant i missed the part where he explained the masterball part :P
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: sorry... I was being sarcastic. but yeah, I agree with you.
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: odd they didnt just program it to always catch
<DarkStratos> MASF123: well addin ya
<Quick_Thinker> well sprinkle i didnt think of this but heres the thing YOU ACTUALY cant do that
<twilight_sprinkle> Freefall29: i actually like scence talk
<DarkStratos> well people im off for some TF2 cya all!
<Quick_Thinker> there must always be a fail
<Freefall29> MASF123: what class do you play as atm
<alexxm> bye DarkStratos
<Freefall29> bye darkstratos
<Quick_Thinker> so one of those numbers had to be a 0
<thelonepony> bye DarkStratos
<spitfirecolt> no stream
<Kinixys> Bye DarkStratos.
<sub06905> bai DarkStratos
<Quick_Thinker> and any of them could have been a 0
<VenHur> Bye DarkStratos.
<DarkStratos> lol wait 5 seconds for all the byes
<Quick_Thinker> bye Dark sorry i bored you with math
<DarkStratos> so i feel happy
<JESmith71> |See ya later DarkStratos
<Bronysith> DarkStratos: have fun
<DarkStratos> naw problem Quick_Thinker
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: but why couldnt it be programmed the same as 2+2=4 for example, that always happenes, so why not make the same happen in-game
<Quick_Thinker> to be honest im new to binary myself i've only learned the numbers up to 40
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: or can 2+2 also fail
<Quick_Thinker> you cant have 2 in binary
<Quick_Thinker> at least not the code
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: i dont mean binary
<Quick_Thinker> its always 1's and 0's
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: i mean the way they programmed 2+2 to always be 4, why cant they program a masterball to always work
<Quick_Thinker> well there is a small possiblity for 2 +2 to fail allthough the only time it did that was when i was doing basic coding in C++
<Bronysith> http://www.deviantart.com/#/d5enqop
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: lol well thats lame
<Quick_Thinker> im not going into any detals for C++ cause it requires a pretty good grasp of math
<Quick_Thinker> i will say this much he is a baisc code in C++
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: maybe its just because they used the same formula as http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/20/Catch_formula_1.png for the masterball?
<DerpyMuffins> Hey everypony
*Bronysith sets DerpyMuffins on fire
<Bronysith> hi
<alexxm> how are things DerpyMuffins
*alexxm kidnaps DerpyMuffins
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: its 100% catch rate only if the pokemons hp 1/3, but thats impossible since hp is an integer
<AJIsAwesome> Hi DerpyMuffins. :)
<Quick_Thinker> #include (isostream)

<Bronysith> wtf
<Moopy> Hey guys is there a stream going on now or no?
<Quick_Thinker> system ("pause") ;
<Quick_Thinker> and there you go
*sub06905 dances a jig
<Quick_Thinker> that just told my computer to pull up the command prompt and ask me my name
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: also you forgot the int main ()
<Quick_Thinker> im able to give an input to that and from there it ends
<Quick_Thinker> shush
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: NOOOOB
<Quick_Thinker> im new to C++ and coding all togehter give me a break
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: jk, i just started recently too :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: whats the system ("pause") for
<Quick_Thinker> i've been watching tutorials on mine
<Spitfire> dat Caramel oc in the stream
<Quick_Thinker> to tell the system to stop asking the question ELSE IT'll GO ON FOREVER
<NullRadix> system makes a system call; on windows, "pause" is a system call you can use to make the command prompt wait until you hit a key
<Quick_Thinker> AND EVER
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: i do return(0)
<Quick_Thinker> also that
<Bronysith> RANDOM VIDEO
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
<Quick_Thinker> i just do the pause way
<shibaru> Penis
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: me thinks return (0) is better since it actually ends it instead of pausing, altho i dont really know the difference
<NullRadix> the reason for adding a pause is usually your program will run to the end, and the command window will poof

*twilight_sprinkle murders Bronysith
<Unnr> is a random video Bronysith Gungam style is predictable
<Quick_Thinker> man i've only been using basic int and other shit like that. The reason why is im planning on making a video game and ITS GOING TO TAKE MONTHS UPON MONTHS OF getting ANGRY at C++ to get even understanding the coding
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: that doesnt work on me
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: youre dead.
<Quick_Thinker> let alone MAKE A GAME
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: nope
<Quick_Thinker> i have the utmost respect for programers now
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: itll take you years to get to that level im thinking
<Quick_Thinker> THEY GO THROUGHT TONS OS SHIT
<Freefall29> I've tried to understand programming. really. but its just too hard for me, all this logic.
<NullRadix> making games and programming games can be two different things
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and you just jelly cuz you cant dance like that
<Quick_Thinker> to that level yes
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: Bronysith: fine, ill murder gangnam in stead
<MASF123> ok I'm back
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: and its easy to dance like that
<alexxm> how are things MASF123
<MASF123> Going to try that beta map.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: vid for proof then
<Quick_Thinker> yeah NullRadix im new to C++ so im not really one to be saying those things
<MASF123> alexxm ok I guess
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: i think c++ graphics is somewhat different
<Quick_Thinker> actually im new to coding and programing all together
<twilight_sprinkle> one day Bronysith , one day.
<Quick_Thinker> started YESTERDAY
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: at least the video is amusing and not stupid like bieber
<Quick_Thinker> it helps to already know binary though
<Quick_Thinker> at least basic
<Quick_Thinker> okay now IM REALLY HUNGRY so bye
<twilight_sprinkle> Quick_Thinker: ive only begun c++ a few weeks ago. before that i only did stuff was in turbo pascal. although i did program quite a bit in mathlab
<twilight_sprinkle> quite a bit, get it? teehee
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but it Is stupid
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: no it isnt
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: once again, you just jelly cuz you cant dance like that
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: it is. the musics sucks, the dancing is easy and....well thats it really, nothing else to it
<Freefall29> Bronysith: which vid you talking about?
<twilight_sprinkle> shitnam style
<Bronysith> Freefall29: Gangnam style
<Dovah> why do i have so little food in my house :(
<twilight_sprinkle> Dovah: cause i ate it
*Bronysith gives Dovah bison meat
<Dovah> twilight_sprinkle: Asshole!
<twilight_sprinkle> Dovah: :<
<Dovah> yay thanks Bronysith :)
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: its actually a somewhat clever bit of social satire, particularly when you add in the variant version with the standard k-pop star singing the refrain
*Dovah beats twilight_sprinkle with a blue whale
*AJIsAwesome eats blue whale
*Bronysith eats Ness
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: its not That clever. i know amatuer pop parodies a billion times better. plus the worst thing is that its popular because its catchy, not because its good
*Dovah blue whale eats AJIsAwesome
*AJIsAwesome makes Bronysith spit out Ness
*twilight_sprinkle eats the whale as Dovah beats him with it
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: now you know how i feel about skyrim
<AJIsAwesome> So much RP today. :D
<Bronysith> fucking hypocrite
*Dovah ends rp
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: What do you know about the south korean music industry?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: skyrim is actually good though.
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: uh oh
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and just like that you are a hypocrite
<Freefall29> Bronysith: how is he a hypocrite for liking skyrim?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i believe you that it might not be as previous elder scrolls since i never played them, but its still a good game. plus i hate gangam being popular because itll induce more music of the same sort
<Bronysith> Freefall29: he doesnt like something everyone else likes, he likes something everyone else likes
<Dovah> Bronysith: why do you say skyrim is bad? what is your resoning? if you are comparign it to dark souls then you need to die.
*alexxm kidnaps twilight_sprinkle
<Bronysith> Dovah: im not comparing it to dark souls cause that is very unfair
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: well i have seen a few songs, but it doesnt seem That clever. plus like i said, its actually getting popular around the world because its catchy, not because good satire
<Freefall29> Dovah: he mostly hates it because he thinks it doesnt deserve all the popular and praise it gets compared to games he likes, such as morrowind.
<AJIsAwesome> *smacks alexxm* "No." :|
<Bronysith> like comparing a porterhouse steak(dark souls) to a piece of stale bread (skyrim)
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: but..but...i never left D:
<alexxm> hey AJIsAwesome what was that for
<Bronysith> Freefall29: how about i answer questions addressed to me you prick :)
<Dovah> Bronysith: thank you I hate when people do that "dark souls is better than skyrim for the sole fact you can play with 1-3 other people in a closly definde world"
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: *kidnapping is not good.* :|
<alexxm> so how did i do that twilight_sprinkle
<Bronysith> Freefall29: answer for me again and i will suck you soul out through your dick :)
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: i.dont.know. o.o
*alexxm kidnaps AJIsAwesome
<Freefall29> Bronysith: wait. you be doing the sucking?
<Bronysith> Freefall29: vaccuum
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: sooo youll suck his dick?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yup,
<twilight_sprinkle> you heard it here first, folks
<Bronysith> but he will die
<AJIsAwesome> *stuffs decoy AJIsAwesome into alexxm's bag*
<Bronysith> most mind blowing 30 seconds of his life
<Bronysith> and his last
<Quick_Thinker> back
<alexxm> huh i didn't know you could do that AJIsAwesome
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I dunoo bronysith, I havn't got my HIV results back yet.
<Quick_Thinker> do what?>
<Bronysith> Freefall29: implying you have sex
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: I always keep decoys of me everywhere, in case of a decoy emergency.
<Dovah> Bronysith: so really whaay do you dislikje skyrim? is it the graphics the gameplay, the story?
<Bronysith> Dovah: yes
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Korean pop in particular is extremely produced to fit a certain style. Psy is actually a bit of an outlaw, with one of his earlier albums banned. Gungam Style, if you bother to translate it, fairly subtlely pokes fun at the gamgam lifestyle, which is the high-fashion, ultra consumer district of Seoul. The idea that a third-tier pop wanna be is making it big in America (the holy grail of most k-pop stars) with a song that is
<Quick_Thinker> WOAH
<twilight_sprinkle1> what?
<twilight_sprinkle1> what did did i miss?
<twilight_sprinkle1> stupid disconnect
<PsychoticDoc> wall of text
<Quick_Thinker> wall
<Quick_Thinker> of
<Unnr> *nods*
<Freefall29> kool-aid man. take down that wall
<Quick_Thinker> txt
<Bronysith> Dovah: skyrim doesnt deserve the love it gets, so overhyped and overrated
<twilight_sprinkle1> link wall?
<Quick_Thinker> OH YEAH
<Unnr> Nope, k-pop rant
<Unnr> from me
<twilight_sprinkle1> Unnr: was it dorected at me?:D
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<twilight_sprinkle1> Unnr: because my chat crashed XDDD
<Freefall29> hello fillyflam
<Quick_Thinker> hi FillyFlam
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, FillyFlam. :)
<God_the_Atheist> hello
<Unnr> Yarrp.
<Unnr> But *shrugs*
<thelonepony> hi FillyFlam
<Wirisme> Hi FillyFlam :)
<God_the_Atheist> how is everyone
<alexxm> how are things FillyFlam
<Freefall29> sup God_the_Atheist
<Quick_Thinker> im good God
<Bronysith> oh no
<twilight_sprinkle1> Unnr: just press up and reenter
<Quick_Thinker> oh shi
<Bronysith> le troll has entered building
<FillyFlam> alexxm: Good, thanks. :)
<Dovah> Bronysith: ..... skyrim has the best grafics of its time the game play is very smooth (could be better tho) and the story is decent yest is slightly over hyped but why hate the game? i am almost willing to bet you have never actually sat down and gave it a legitimate try
<[SWAG]Haku> nananananananananananananananana
<Bronysith> Dovah: ...
<Unnr> Using a standalone client specifically set to not re-enter text when up arrow is pressed.
<God_the_Atheist> what r we watching
*Freefall29 gives Dovah flame shield.
<Bronysith> Dovah: what kind of person would i be if i gave a game a review without playing it ?
<Wirisme> Circles of buffering
<twilight_sprinkle1> . . .
<God_the_Atheist> the magical power of buffering
<Bronysith> Dovah: i logged 50 hours in that PoS
*[SWAG]Haku likes to watch the moving circle chase its own tail
<Bronysith> Dovah: it is so boring
<Dovah> Bronysith: you'd be surprised how many people do that
<Bronysith> Dovah: implying i am a sheep false gamer
<[SWAG]Haku> Also, Haku is here
<Bronysith> I play games for my own personal enjoyment
<Quick_Thinker> okay so apparently most peoplle learning program by after a 6 months they should Be masters at it
<Freefall29> Dovah: you're saying we should play the game before bashing it? I got too much pride to play black ops 2.
<Bronysith> i dont care for other peoples opinions
<Dovah> Bronysith: so you like action rpg's better?
<God_the_Atheist> once i got a pack of shapies,i then used those sharpies all over my keyboard, now my fingers are colorful
<Dovah> Freefall29: only exeption
<Bronysith> Dovah: never said that
<Bronysith> Dovah: i like good games, not overhyped pieces of crap
<[SWAG]Haku> And whats a good game then?
<God_the_Atheist> good games are good
<Bronysith> Dovah: plus Dark souls was a complete game from
<Bronysith> launch
<Bronysith> and not have planned DLC
<Dovah> Bronysith: no it wasnt
<[SWAG]Haku> Tell Haku, what makes a game good?
<Dovah> Bronysith: Prepare to Die, nuff said
<alexxm> night guys
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: personal enjoyment
<Dovah> night alexxm
<Bronysith> Dovah: thats what it is called for the PC dumbass
<Wirisme> bye alexxm
<Freefall29> night alexxm, don't be kiddnapping no more, ya hear
<alexxm> ok Freefall29
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: what makes a game good is on personal enjoyment, not what other people say
<AJIsAwesome> night alexxm :)
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I think you should cut him a little slack man
<Bronysith> i dont find skyrim to be good
<thelonepony> night alexxm
<Dovah> Bronysith: "since launch" it came out nearly a year ago and they are planning a dlc to add prepare to die to counsol
<Reikim> Ded?
<Bronysith> Freefall29: your soul is looking mighty tasty
<Bronysith> Dovah: planning, not PLANNED
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronysith exactly, so leave the man alone, please. He likes a game, or he dislikes it (Im not really keeping up with you two) but I do know that whats good isnt really up to debate
<Dovah> Bronysith: Well technically it is planned now
<JESmith71> He guy, check this promo for another Brony documentary done by Paleo:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BBhaU19tKg&feature=player_embedded
<Dovah> there is a releast date
<Bronysith> Dovah: skyrim had PLANNED dlc since launch to suck money from your wallet
<Reikim> Ded.
<[SWAG]Haku> Yeah, welcome to the real world
<[SWAG]Haku> almost all games and movies are made to make you empty your wallet
<Dovah> Bronysith: skyrim is hundreds of times bigger than dark souls and is still getting bigger
<JESmith71> And somehow the link gets messed up
<[SWAG]Haku> thats the point
<JESmith71> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BBhaU19tKg&feature=player_embedded
<AJIsAwesome> RANDOM VIDEO
<Freefall29> look. maybe skyrim did plan dlc. least it didn't pull a mass effect 3 and cut content for dlc
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&list=LL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ&v=1eZQjtbRgn8&feature=fvwp
<CrimsonPhoenix> If MH3U doesn't make it in the US I'll be pissed
<Bronysith> Dovah: just because something is big doesnt mean it is good
<FillyFlam> To be completely honest I think these days basically every game has planned DLC.
<Bronysith> like
<Bronysith> at all
*[SWAG]Haku doesnt really know what DLC means, but also doest care
<Bronysith> yes, it can be big AND good
<Bronysith> but not all the time
<Bronysith> very rarely infact
<Quick_Thinker> the suckiest thing about learning to program is that i have only my self to learn and the internet no class to TEACH me its all on my own. I've looked all around my state for a month and could not find ONE ,so i just DECIDED FUCK IT I'LL LEARN HOW TO PROGAM ON MY OWN
<Quick_Thinker> its been a pretty nice start so far though
<Bronysith> Quick_Thinker: you're mad arent you?
<Quick_Thinker> no
<[SWAG]Haku> So is anything even streaming?
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: nop
<[SWAG]Haku> damn
<Dovah> still dont think you really TRUELY gave skyrim a try, did you just meander around the woods for 50 hours? did you bother with all the funny easter eggs and intentional/unintentional glitches?
<Bronysith> <.<
<Bronysith> >.>
<Freefall29> Quick_Thinker: there are colleges to learn programming....
<Quick_Thinker> ambicious (that is sooooo not spelled right im sure of it)
<Quick_Thinker> Freefall IM NOT A COLLAGE STUDENT IM 16
<Bronysith> Dovah: dont tell me i didnt give it a try
<[SWAG]Haku> Well I vote for a change of subect
<Quick_Thinker> in other words IM ON MY OWN
<Bronysith> Dovah: DONT YOU EVER TELL ME THAT, I GAVE THAT GAME 3 TRIES
<Kinixys> AJIsAwesome: Kitty style fu.
<Bronysith> EACH TIME BORES THE FUCK OUT OF ME
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: IKR? :D
<Dovah> Bronysith: .... correct me if i'm wrong but i think i just did.
<Freefall29> Bronysith and Dovah.... you're fighting like a married couple... either STFU.... or STFU

<Wirisme> It's getting chilly in here
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: No prob.
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: Bronysith is hating on skyrim for no truly good reasons
<Bronysith> thats what politics is in general
<Klumzeedragon> I'm going to watch Brony Breakdown, I'll be back everypony. :)
<Dark92Enigma> I'm a free wing, i'm not influenced by politics
<Bronysith> Dovah: the gameplay sucks, and the grpahics are bad, no immersion, game breaking bugs
<Bronysith> WTF
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: BLASPHMER!
<Freefall29> Bronysith: well liberals aint so great either. disagree anyway or you're racist/intolerant/ignorant.
<[SWAG]Haku> Dark92Enigma Gangnam Style is a music video by Psy. Its KPop.
<[SWAG]Haku> Its very good
*Bronysith le devilish grin

<Obsidian> Well thats it for me tonight. Bye everypony.
<Bronysith> Dovah: also, the graphics dont make the game,
<FillyFlam> Tata Obsidian.
<Bronysith> if you disagree with this
<Bronysith> you are a false gamer
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<thelonepony> bye Obsidian
<Reikim> Oooh
<Reikim> And you know what
<Dark92Enigma> [SWAG]Haku Oh OK......gonna listen to it
<Reikim> I JUST BOUGHT THAT GAME
<[SWAG]Haku> DO IT
*Reikim cracks knuckles
*Bronysith dances about
<Dark92Enigma> man your name was hard
<Dovah> Bronysith: then dont judge skyrim by its graphics which i assume you were doing
<Dark92Enigma> to write*
<Reikim> I think it's time I entered the fray, as it were.
*[SWAG]Haku decides to do the NUma NUma now
<Freefall29> Bronysith: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL1lfSzgcAw. this video also applies to everypony.
<Dark92Enigma> By the way, newsletter is open for you guys?
<Bronysith> Dovah: im not, the game is just overhyped, too fucking easy even on the hardest setting, the gameplay is shoddy and the only reason everyone loves it is because ERMAGHERD DRAGONS
<Reikim> GoI does teams, right? Airship crews?
<Reikim> There should be a Team Bronystate.
<Bronysith> Dovah: dont call me ignorant, i played it and beat it and gave it a few other chances
<[SWAG]Haku> Dragons that also fight the trolls if you get them togetehr
<Dovah> skyrim immersion is no heavy rain but its not that bad and honestly I didnt give a crap about the dragons, i was in it for the lore
<Bronysith> Dovah: plus it makes you sound so fucking retarded
<Bronysith> Dovah: WHAT LORE?!
<Freefall29> Bronysith: woah. dude. no need to attack him like that
<[SWAG]Haku> Wait, are they still at it?
<[SWAG]Haku> I thought they were doen with this
<Dark92Enigma> Did anypony got into the lottery? My newsletter is still closed
<Freefall29> [SWAG]Haku: yeah.
<Dovah> Bronysith: what lore WHAT LORE!!! my god
<Bronysith> problem solved
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: Graphics are a huge part in deciding wether a game is good or not, while a game CAN have bad graphics but still be awesome(tf2 Im looking at you), Graphics are really important.
<Bronysith> ...
<Dovah> [SWAG]Haku: i thought were wer done to but apperently not
<Bronysith> -_____________-
<[SWAG]Haku> EVERYONE IS INTITLES TO THEIR OWN OPINION. GET OVER IT. HE LIKES THE GAME, THE OTHER DOESNT. SO FUCKING WHAT?!
<DerpyMuffins> Buffer show still on?
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: thank you,
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: graphics are not that important
*[SWAG]Haku is embarassed because he accidently put caps lock on
<Freefall29> Bronysith and Dovah.... you're both acting like immature children. I really hope you both feel silly.
<Bronysith> just enough to make it playable
<Dovah> Freefall29: nope not at all
<Bronysith> Freefall29: implying immature children get married
<Dark92Enigma> [SWAG]Haku: Don't worry, i usually do that in case of a bad movie
<Freefall29> Bronysith: well in some countries they do.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: its okay, i just ignored the dumbass anyways
<Dovah> yeah Freefall29 Bronysith is right, that is just plain wrong...
<[SWAG]Haku> Speaking of bad movies, whats up with this weeks B movie?
<Freefall29> Dovah: what are you talking about
<DoctoDoctorWho> [SWAG]Haku: He can have his own opinion, Its when he starts going past "I dont like it" and starts openly hating that things become serious business
<Bronysith> who doesnt listen to anyones opinions and if you disagree then you are ignorant or communist or something
*Bronysith gangnam styles all over chat

<DoctoDoctorWho> Skyrim player vs hater war goin on rite now
<Dovah> Scoot-Scootaloo: me and Bronysith are arguing about why skyrim is absolutly horrific and every way (bronysith) and why it really isnt all that bad (me)

<Bronysith> Freefall29: im done now, i ignored him anyways
<cachi01|phone> Skyrim is good. PERIOD
<Quick_Thinker> man maybe with enough time i can learn how to make a website on C++
<Bronysith> he wont listen to anyones opinions
<Freefall29> Bronysith: you're a hypocrite dude
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT is glad to have shared over 20 betas
<FillyFlam> CrimsonPhoenix: I found "butt trumpet" far funnier than it had any right to be.
<cachi01|phone> c++ is a java script right
<cachi01|phone> X
<cachi01|phone> ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I believe c++ and Java are completely different
<Bronysith> Freefall29: i only muted him so that way he keeps complaining and being butthurt and then i dont get banned
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> only around 5 people i know bought the game anyway :p
<Kinixys> C++, I'm told, is similar, but they aren't the same.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Bronysith: You muted Dovah?
<Kinixys> They are similiar in how they work. Syntax is different.
<Dovah> hahahahahaha! he thinks I'm upset!!! oh god thats priceless!! someone realy that message to him!
<CrimsonPhoenix> isn't c++ more cleaer than Java though?
<Bronysith> DoctoDoctorWho: only way for no more arguing
<Freefall29> DoctoDoctorWho: yeah. that was really hypocritical of Bronysith
<Dovah> it has just made my day
<cachi01|phone> (Dovah) hahahahahaha! he thinks I'm upset!!! oh god thats priceless!! someone realy that message to him!
<Reikim> Wii U launch titles and prices released.
<Bronysith> Freefall29: why is that? cause i dont want to be screamed at and keep being called ignorant?
<Dovah> thanks cachi01|phone :)
<Reikim> 300 isn't bad for a next-gen console, let's be honest.
<Reikim> Better than the PS3's 599 US DOLLARS.
<cachi01|phone> Now Frefall vs Bronysith?
<Freefall29> Bronysith: ok... you say you don't like people going after you for opinions... yet you had a flame war with Dovah, attacked him several times calling him a dumbass, when all he ask was for examples why you hated skyrim. you were attacking him.
<Reikim> And from the lineup...I think Assassin's Creed 3 is going to be the Wii U's killer launch title, unless the ME3 special edition comes with a revised ending or something.
<cachi01|phone> .......
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Alright alright, it seems as though we have a it of a predicament.
<Reikim> And Black Ops 2. All the FPS nuts are going to go after that one.
<Bronysith> Freefall29: i told him exactly what my problems were for skyrim
<cachi01|phone> Bad time is kinda bad
<Dovah> oooh dis gun be good!

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<Reikim> Better question: when ISN'T there a new champ?
<Freefall29> flutter_spin: :D
<Reikim> Also: Bayonetta 2, a Nintendo-funded exclusive? Now there's something I never expected to see.
<thelonepony> :D
<DerpyMuffins> More Luna?
<flutter_spin> yeah sorry. They announced that.
<Freefall29> DerpyMuffins: there was a troll face next to that... :'(
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well they need new games for the wii u they need exclusives aside from the normal mario and zelda
<cachi01|phone> That batman vid was fucking.hilarious XD
<flutter_spin> lol cachi01|phone, I know
<DerpyMuffins> Well wish me luck guys, Im a try to submit my fanfic on EqD again
<tigher1001> more lune *TROLL FSCE*
<Cynder7> 6:O Awesome :3
<tigher1001> face
<tigher1001> luna
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0 is the other cool thing I found.
<DerpyMuffins> Second times the charm
<cachi01|phone> Luck DerpyMuffins
<Reikim> True enough, though they've got a nice edge over everyone else.
<Freefall29> Derpy_Hooves: what kind of fanfic is it?
<AJIsAwesome> Good luck DerpyMuffins. :)
<Reikim> I'm disappointed there's no Zelda for launch, though.
<tigher1001> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y01nr0DcrKI&feature=relmfu
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> same thing happend with the wii
<Cades> I was freaking out this morning when I found it :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they go first
<DerpyMuffins> Wrong Derpy Freefall29
<Reikim> I'm probably not going to bother getting one until either a Zelda or a Smash Bros comes out.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> microsoft and sony copy and make it better
<Freefall29> doh
<flutter_spin> DerpyMuffins: I kind of accepted that EQD will not accept mine for obvious reasons
<Reikim> >Better
<Reikim> >Kinect/Move
<Freefall29> DerpyMuffins: is it a dirty fanfic?
*Reikim laughs
<flutter_spin> mine? no no no
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: EQD are just a bunch of assholes anyways
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> who said i'm talking about move and kinect ?
<flutterchu> http://derpy.me/xQUiq
<twilight_sprinkle1> Bronysith: why?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm talking about the console itself
<tigher1001> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o&feature=related
<flutter_spin> First they changed the rules. They don't accept brony stories.
<Reikim> They didn't make it better; they were doing their own thing.
<Reikim> They had completely different strategies.
<Shizuka> 13so on a serious note
<Cynder7> 6^^
<Reikim> There is no link between any of the three consoles.
<DerpyMuffins> Freefall29 Here http://www.fimfiction.net/story/50037/The-heart-wants-what-the-heart-wants.
<flutter_spin> So I changed it. Then I found out they don't like my obvious "Mary Sue" notion
<Freefall29> flutter_spin: its their own fault they posted cupcakes on the site.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you do see i'm not refering to move controllers ?
<Reikim> Yeah
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Shizuka is a Pyro.
<Shizuka> 13china has patrol boats near islands they've disputed with japan since WWII
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm talking about the console
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That is all.
<flutterchu> never stop worriing about the thing i cant CONTROOOOOOOOLLLLLLL
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no one cares about kinect/move
<twilight_sprinkle1> flutter_spin: they dont do fics anymore?
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: i submitted my story, they didnt even read the first paragraph before denying it
<Reikim> But the objective of the other two consoles was not "make a better Wii"
<Shizuka> 13the boats are ignoring japanese coast guard orders to GTFO
<Reikim> It was "make a powerful and popular next-gen console
<Reikim> "
<flutter_spin> twilight_sprinkle1: "brony" fics.. as in "I was teleported into Equestria"
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle1: they do... its just very, restricted after the cupcakes incident
<Shizuka> 13we are under treaty that if japan is attacked, the US retaliates with them
<Reikim> The Wii had a completely different objective.
<Bronysith> ogod
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sorry but everything those console had was a copy and upgrade from the wii
<Reikim> Personally I see there being a great divide between the Wii and its "competitors"
<Shizuka> 13so yeah
<Dovah> us vs china?
<Shizuka> 13that's happening
<Reikim> Copy?
<Freefall29> Bronysith: why didn't they accept your fanfic?
<twilight_sprinkle1> flutter_spin: why not?
<Reikim> No.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes
<cachi01|phone> Here. Have some WOAH OH OH HA AH AH AAAA HA AH AH HA AH http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AqHtBLUjgo&feature=youtube_gdata_player
<Reikim> They were developed roughly at the same time.
<Shizuka> 13and the best part
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tell me why not
<Shizuka> 13the treaty china is citing that says the islands should be theirs
<Shizuka> 13the US wrote it
<Reikim> At the same time the Wii was being developed, they were also being developed.
<flutter_spin> twilight_sprinkle1: they stated that a huge majority of brony-fics are bad. Therefore, they just outright chunked them.
<Dovah> oh wow
<Reikim> Copy? Of course not. The three consoles are as different as can be, in multiple aspects.
<Freefall29> Bronysith: why did they reject your fanfic again?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I guess you can say the chinese landed themselves on hot water!
<flutter_spin> Someone mentioned Anthology, I think. They said they are keeping the ones before the rule
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03YEAHHHH!
<cachi01|phone> Ba dum tss
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: Booooo........
<Shizuka> 13more like we have a problem
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> like what ?
<Reikim> Besides, M$/Sony would never DEIGN to copy a Nintendo thing.
<RaveBrony> ^
<Shizuka> 13like for serious
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you think ?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys :$ sigh Dark Souls dumb archers lol
<twilight_sprinkle1> flutter_spin: well, if it was, then theres no point i ndoing it. they still do a ton of toher awesome stuff
<CCCP> Scoot-Scootaloo I can type ur name
<Shizuka> 13if china's gearing up to try and take back some islands from japan
<AJIsAwesome> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, we've already had problems. This is just another problem.
<cachi01|phone> Lol hi Sketch
<Dovah> so does Bronysith still ignoring me? simple yes or no question i mean no harm
<Reikim> That was a sarcastic statement, because of Kinect/Move, but console-wise they weren't.
<Reikim> On the technical side, there's processing.
<twilight_sprinkle1> i hope i wasnt right about russia and china attacking the world :I
<Cynder7> 6Think I just found your account too xD
<Freefall29> Dovah: I think he unmuted you.
<Reikim> PS3's processing is completely different; eight goddamn cores that nobody knows how to use.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You are so MLG CCCP
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you seriously think they din't copy anything in those consoles ?
<Reikim> I think they had similar strategies in certain places.
<twilight_sprinkle1> also its funny how dari actually mentioned that theres always a war a few years after a brit wins a grand slam
<Cades> On deviantart?
<cachi01|phone> Nah i think he is using hax
<tigher1001> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvIFIdQEy0A&feature=channel&list=UL
<Cynder7> 6Yeah :P
<Reikim> However, I do not believe anything was a direct copy save for the aforementioned retarded motion controls.
<flutter_spin> twilight_sprinkle1: but like "Rainbow Dash Presents: Captain Hook the Biker Gorilla" -- I too scream "I just want to be loved"
<DerpyMuffins> Why is CCCP MMLG?
<Cades> haha
<Reikim> Their very aims were different.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> again i'm not refering to motion controles
<Reikim> Okay, what ARE you referring to then?
<flutter_spin> Getting on EQD was sort of this "I'm officially cool"
<Dovah> Well in that case, thank you Bronysith, our 'conversation' was very stimulating.
<flutter_spin> Now, I could care less. EQD reputation is nothing what I first thought it was.
<cachi01|phone> Diabetes bubblegum and muffins
<CCCP> :D
<twilight_sprinkle1> flutter_spin: youre the guy who made those daibow dash presents videos?O.o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> let see Wii was basicly > wi-fi > miis> store
<cachi01|phone> Still better than Fedex
<Freefall29> does EQD tend to overhype the stuff it posts?
<flutter_spin> twilight_sprinkle1: what? no. I just said I agree with him.
