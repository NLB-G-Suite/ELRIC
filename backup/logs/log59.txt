<Nittany_Tiger_> SilverMane: I dunno, but I want pizza.
<mib_hjus4d> Black Dynamite x Mane 6
*EspyLacopa goes to find Gaston song
<SirSprinkles> 6Different error than before.
<sotha> Gummy is hosting a upscale party in an upscale club in upscale Manehatten.
<SilverMane> haven't watched Black Dynamite, and cna't watch. more ideas!
<Dumori> So random 57 people what should I eat?
<SirSprinkles> 6This one plays, but it just says it's 0:00:00 long and instantly stops.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Black Dynamite x The Man
<Dee_Twenty> Human flesh.
<SilverMane> not bad sotha, any other ideas?
<Hipster_Brony> wtf?
<EspyLacopa> Imagine what Gaston would be like if he was as intelligent as Beauty.
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry guys, have to drop stream for a sec to fix the technical problems.
<EspyLacopa> Wait, her name is Belle.
<Nittany_Tiger_> How about non-shipping.

<Dee_Twenty> Rainbow cupcakes. :p
<EspyLacopa> Sounds spicy.
<Dermathil> I think next week for the movie night I could be watching from a hotel room in Windsor.
<sotha> Hmm SilverMane. . . I think we need other people to contribute, but I will continue thinking.
<prince-dari> Just remembered that you can't go on sites that aren't registered as 'safe'.
*SilverMane so far we have Gummy hosting a party in a club in Manehatten. Currently best suggestion, any other ideas before i get writing in my head?
<Combustiblelemons> oh I know!
<RobotPinkie> I have pretty pink cupcakes.
<Combustiblelemons> eat baked bads.
<RobotPinkie> No hot sauce, unfortunately.
<prince-dari> Damn.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Is this shipping fic?
<Combustiblelemons> Baked bads FTW.
<SilverMane> doesn't have to be, Nittany_Tiger_
<mib_hjus4d> Power Ranger Ponies
<Nittany_Tiger_> Good.
<Ghosties> Did you try it earlier?
<SilverMane> depends on how people push it
<Dman> SilverMane just a quick question who do you want me to record?
<Dman> just you?
<Dman> how will others join in?
<EspyLacopa> ....Good lord, Gaston eats five dozen eggs a day?
<SilverMane> yes Dman, but not yet. others will suggest, and I wite
<gone> 03o.o

<Combustiblelemons> we need more 2033 ponies D:
<Nittany_Tiger_> Just in case her sister gets mad again.
<sotha> I'm not exactly fit with coming up with good story material. We could have the Party of One guests (Gummy's favourite partiers) attending, and the mane six have to learn to try to cope with them.
<DashAttack> wow, totally just refreshed the page and messed my name up like a dumbass
<RobotPinkie> Pony Hill?
<sotha> We could have Pinkie upstaged by Gummy as a better party host.
<EspyLacopa> Resident Pony?
<RobotPinkie> In my dreams, I see that town...
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<Nittany_Tiger_> 2012: Ponies.
<Munith> RobotPinkie: that already exists
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, I have.
<Munith> Lemme fetch a link
<Nittany_Tiger_> Twister: Ponies.
<sotha> We could have the Oranges attending, and Applejack feeling as if she has to try to live up to some standard for them or something
<Ghosties> So, what do?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Ponies trying to understand the weather that they control. :p
*Espeon comforts HML.
<prince-dari> What file type is it?
<RobotPinkie> Wow, I might have to read that, sounds... Horrifying
<Nittany_Tiger_> Deatstalker: Ponies?
<prince-dari> :o
<Combustiblelemons> Grand theft pony?
<Munith> RobotPinkie: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-silent-ponyville.html Quite a good read
<Gnorri> alone in the ponies?
<mib_hjus4d> Battlestar Celestia
<RobotPinkie> Thanks, Munith
<sotha> Of course SilverMane doesn't get any of my ideas. :P
<D_man> My internet's continually derping right now
<Munith> Still hoping for an Amnesia crossover sometime soon. You're welcome!
<EspyLacopa> MLP crossed with the Diablo franchise.
<sotha> Oh well.

<Combustiblelemons> still searching for pony 2033 images :(
<D_man> Silvermane I don't know if i'll be able to record, my internet's really derpy right now, and this rarely happens but when it does it goes on and on for hours
<Dermathil> snap, Dman.

<DragonRage> Weird Al + Ponies = ???
<SirSprinkles> 6Hmm... looks like everything that was in that folder doesn't work... text documents, images... everything... Oo
<EspyLacopa> Even Wierd Al has responded to the pony polka.
<Combustiblelemons> I think he's a brony too?
<DashAttack> the only Weird Al album i ever owned was Bad Hair Day
<Dermathil> Weird Al + Ponies = Awesome.
<Dermathil> with capital A
<sotha> Has anyone done a Weird Al pony yet?
<Alix> Needs more harmonies
<Sathi> 7you might want to scan your pc for parasprites
<Sathi> 7and such
<DashAttack> but it was awesome
<Dermathil> yes sotha, at the end of this vid
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going to.
<Sathi> 7doesn't sound normal to me
<Dermathil> he makes a cameo
<sotha> perfect
<EspyLacopa> Season 2 maybe for a singing Wierd Al pony?
<RobotPinkie> The older I get, the more I love Weird Al. It feels weird.
<Darky> 06just on mibbit GL
<DragonRage> Feel Good!
<Dermathil> I heard that they had tried to contact weird Al so he could cameo in an episode.
<Silvermane> Lol.
<Darky> 06i tried it, but you might want to use a USB keyvboard
<NightSeas> 12But how do you push enter D:
<drf|away> 03send button
<Darky> 06erm...
<Darky> 06yes, send
<Dermathil> I am not joking.
<Ziltoid> lies
<DashAttack> seems like something he would do, imo
<EspyLacopa> lol.
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Dermathil> I think it was on EqD.
<Alix> Oh dear god yes
<prince-dari> I'm pretty sure there's at least 1 IRC client for wii homebrew.
<HyperMetalLugia> I doubt it
<drf|away> 03is there?
<prince-dari> I remember there being 1 when I checked AGES ago.
<drf|away> 03I haven't seen one actually
<Dumori> MLP must get awesomer!
<drf|away> 03then again I haven't even touched my Wii in like a year
<drf|away> 03so yeah
<drf|away> 03somehow playing games on Xbox seems more satisfying
<sotha> It isn't already
<sotha> ?
<drf|away> 03you get achievements to show off
<EspyLacopa> My favorite Wierd Al cameo I've seen so far was his cameo in Transformers Animated, as Wreck-gar. "I DARE to be stupid!"
<drf|away> 03you beat a game on Wii and you're all like "...I just wasted my life"
<drf|away> 03and have nothing to show for it
<drf|away> 03XD
<Dashite> :D
<Dermathil> FOUND IT!!!
<Dermathil> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/fim-director-asks-weird-al-for-guest.html
<Dermathil> there we go
<Combustiblelemons> awesomely made pmv.
<Dumori> sotha still doesn't mean it can get MORE awesome
<DashAttack> not much of a cameo, but i loved his Weasel Stomping Day song on Robot Chicken
<sotha> true
<NightSeas> 12lol. Too bad wii don't have achievements
<HyperMetalLugia> And I can say that you've wasted your life with achivements :D
<drf|away> 03I know
<drf|away> 03but at least you can show others
<drf|away> 03etc
<DragonRage> Double take.
<Alix> Wait a minute
<Dermathil> And that's an APRIL news article.
<HyperMetalLugia> ...and everyone has the same achivements
<Alix> Broke doesn't rhyme with digger
<HyperMetalLugia> And nobody will care
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<EspyLacopa> A mere technicality.
<Dermathil> SEE?
<Alix> It's almost as if they were going to say some other word that DID rhyme but replaced it at the last second
<drf|away> 03LOL
<Hipster_Brony> do you scan these files after you download them?
<DragonRage> Subverted Rhyme Every Occasion is fine too.
<interior_gummy> friendship is gic?
<Hipster_Brony> one of them may have had a virus
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry about the technical problems guys, I got hit by a virus and it killed my whole folder, apparently. Should be fixed in a few more minutes.
<Alix> Dastardly lyrical shenannigans!
<EspyLacopa> Toot?
<HyperMetalLugia> Seriously, that is going to be true
<SirSprinkles> 6I do scan them.
<SilverSonic> nah
<Dermathil> darnit, that's bad SirSprinkles
<Combustiblelemons> cut my steak into pieces! this is my plastic fork!
<SilverSonic> everyone is different ;p
<Dumori> SirSprinkles YAY!
<SirSprinkles> 6Something else hit me. Dunno what.
<Elky> oh viruses, you so silly
<Hipster_Brony> strange
<Sathi> 7maybe malware
<HyperMetalLugia> Back to OoT3D then :P
<Ziltoid> damn virusus
<Combustiblelemons> my friend honestly thought what this song said when he first hears it
<SirSprinkles> 6Probably.
<DashAttack> YOU WANTED TO
<Sathi> 7get malwarebytes
<HyperMetalLugia> Fire temple 8D
<sotha> I love this song
<SirSprinkles> 6I got it out already though.
<Dumori> SirSprinkles you really haven't had a good week have you?
<prince-dari> I think the IRC client was part of one of the homebrew OSs.
<muffin_hooves> SirSprinkles' computer ate a baked bad.
*Dumori hugs SirSprinkles
<HyperMetalLugia> And strangely, I'm not stuck yet... 3 keys in
<drf|away> 03oh, could be
<SirSprinkles> 6Didn't take long to fix.
<DragonRage> I feel for ya, Sprinkles.
<NightSeas> 12Lol SMF 2.0 must be giving Art the time of her life xD /random

<HyperMetalLugia> I would make a off colour joke about Arti's free time
<HyperMetalLugia> But nah
<Hipster_Brony> pony folder*
<Combustiblelemons> U.K bronies unite!
<Dermathil> I'm still standing we gotta watch Ponyscope for today after.

<Combustiblelemons> :o
<prince-dari> MFW my pony folder is gone.
<Dermathil> sotha: PMV of horoscope for today.
<drf|away> 03LL
<Hipster_Brony> ...
<sotha> oh okay
<drf|away> 03I need to do my laundry
<Hipster_Brony> wat
<Elky> hey, g1 is okay
<drf|away> 03and then I can talk on XBL
<DashAttack> derp
<prince-dari> It was on my hard drive which went boom.
<Sathi> 7:(
<prince-dari> >5000 pony images T_T
<Hipster_Brony> oh shit, that sux
<Elky> hate on g3 all you want
<prince-dari> It might be able to recover it though.
<ReticentSmolder> gah, I'm so exhausted, I woke up at 5am and ran 4 miles
<Sathi> 7ah
<Hipster_Brony> hopefully
<Combustiblelemons> gentlemen.
<Dumori> ReticentSmolder why?
<Axel_Foaley> G2 was ok.
<RainbowCrash> oh Al
<ReticentSmolder> because I'm training for a half-marathon
<NightSeas> 12I wonder if she’s going to be changing the navigation tabs or anything
<prince-dari> What's more annoying is the I had loads of irreplaceable stuff on there, unlike pony episodes/images.
<Dumori> Ah fun fun fun
<Elky> I haven't really watched any g2 stuff
<DragonRage> Dayum, Fluttershy.
<EspyLacopa> Insanity would be: Episode wherein Pinkie Pie's uncle visits the town for a day. . .and it's the Wierd Al cameo.
<Hipster_Brony> i remember when !!Derpy got locked out of his mod account on ponychan because he spilled tea on his laptop
<ReticentSmolder> oh, and 5am because it hits 100 degrees by 8am here
<Staeld> NightSeas: actually, Arti is currently not at home.
<Hipster_Brony> damn, that really sucks man
<Combustiblelemons> *obeys fluttershy*
<sotha> Yes. Weird Al should be Pinkie's uncle.
<DashAttack> EspyLacopa: that has potential to be the best episode ever
<Alix> Not surprising
<Combustiblelemons> pinkie's uncle = mr cake.
<Alix> No wonder pinkie's so good at playing musical instruments
<EspyLacopa> You say that as though she is only allowed a single uncle.
<NightSeas> 12No, she said she would be working on the site with Lugia this week
<Dermathil> so many people say that Weird al would become Pinkie's ungle
<sotha> I thought they weren't related Combustiblelemons
<Light_Latias> 12kay
<Staeld> she has been. At her home.
<Combustiblelemons> then why does she live there?
<Elky> dat dash banana
<Dumori> The cakes and pinie are just close
<Staeld> they left yesterday though.
<sotha> apprenticeship
<NightSeas> 12Also, who are you? XD
<RainbowCrash> Weird Al is actually *Pinkie's father* you know the one with the "problems"... she had to go to a foster home
<Alix> The cake family and the Pie family
<Staeld> not sure if she's still working on them while they're gone.
<Alix> Hm, makes sense
<Staeld> oh.
<Combustiblelemons> hmm...
<Silvermane> sure is quiet in here now
<Lakorv> better?
<Combustiblelemons> I suppose so.
<HyperMetalLugia> Russia- oh
<Elky> Weird Al is actually Granny Pie
<HyperMetalLugia> Hin
<NightSeas> 12Oh lol
<HyperMetalLugia> *Him
<sotha> yes
<Alix> :u
<NightSeas> 12Yes XD
<EspyLacopa> http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/109/b/e/__weird_al___flankovic_by_itchymango-d3edynn.jpg
<Lakorv> issa spy.

<DashAttack> rofl
<DashAttack> awesome
<Combustiblelemons> perfect.
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<sotha> ow wow
<prince-dari> MFW this
<prince-dari> "So over on Twitter, Goldenrusset (The Director for MLP FiM) has sent a tweet off to Weird Al asking him for a guest appearance! So far he hasn't responded yet, but it's still neat to see people from the FiM team actively posting around on the internet. I can only imagine how crazy a Weird Al Pinkie Pie episode would be! "
<RobotPinkie> <3
<Ziltoid> amazing
<Winter-Puff> love that pic
<prince-dari> :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<DashAttack> this totally needs to happen
<Dermathil> eeyup, that'S Weird Pony alright
<Alix> They even got the floral shirt right
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<EspyLacopa> His cutey mark: He's a large ham?
<NightSeas> 12XD
<RainbowCrash> Weid Al is hammy
<Dermathil> seems like it, could be also a reference to the food album he released (FAT and Eat it being on it)
<Elky> that's supposed to be ham?
<Elky> huh
<RobotPinkie> Hammond Organ?
<drf|away> 03let's hope Weird Al has some sanity and turns the offer down
<EspyLacopa> That or Bologna.
<prince-dari> :P
<Combustiblelemons> ham with a pineapple slice
<prince-dari> Weird Al has posted pony videos on his Twitter before.
<Combustiblelemons> lol troll pinkie face
<prince-dari> So I'm not so sure.
<Armads> ">	let's hope Weird Al has some sanity"
<Armads> lolol
<sotha> It looks like bologna
<DashAttack> yeah, i think that looks like bologna
<Light_Latias> 12Weird Al? sane?
<NightSeas> 12It would help promote him, so he probably will do it
<Dermathil> he's also holding Pinkie's Accordion (color)
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<interior_gummy> flutterplot
<Light_Latias> 12the world will stop
<Ziltoid> I agree
<EspyLacopa> Dermathil: Where do you think Pinkie got /her/ accordian?
<Dermathil> hehe, gift from her awesome uncle?
<EspyLacopa> Her Wierd uncle.
<Dermathil> more like it EspyLacopa
<Hipster_Brony> >mfw bestiality wordfilter on ponychan keeps ruining everything
<interior_gummy> friendship is gic
<EspyLacopa> Weird Uncle Flank.
<Espeon> 06NightSeas is quite right, wouldn't be surprised.
<Espeon> 06Would be rather silly though
<interior_gummy> NOW! :D
<Ziltoid> Is everything fixed?
<Dermathil> Hopefully pinkie pie will have a dialogue where she says she's got a "Weird" uncle.
<Dermathil> that'd be so awesome without even him being on the show
<NightSeas> 12That it would be XD
<Ghosties> How are we looking on the film, Sprinkles?
<sotha> BG pic?
<Winter-Puff> we can dream

<Rezo-channer> Nothing beats Clint.
<Glacymr> 12i thought it'd be like magic
<DrDoom> Dirty Harry vs. Black dynamite
<Destructor236> SPINNING NEWSPAPER DECLARED LAMEST CLICHÉ BY POPULATION.

<DrDoom> The world would turn into a holocaust
<sotha> Clint Eastwood would win
<Combustiblelemons> DAMN IT LAG D:
<Elky> that's what I figured
<Dermathil> Same here, Hipster. I just keep refreshing every 15 seconds or when I get heavy lag
<DrDoom> where the only survivors
<Axel_Foaley> My version doesn't have the evil laugh
<Elky> but eastwood has a gun
<DrDoom> would be clint and black dynamite
<Dermathil> THEY GOT EVERYTHING!
<Dermathil> inb4 next Hipster movie ref
<EspyLacopa> if B.D. met Clint Eastwood. . .BD would learn how to be an awesome cowboy, and Clint would learn how to wear an afro like a pro.

<HyperMetalLugia> Whoops
<Elky> >Clint Eastwood with an afro
<Axel_Foaley> What black suburbs are like in real life.

<Dman> Black Dynamite: First Lady, I'm sorry I pimp-slapped you into that china cabinet. I used excessive force. Oftentimes, I cross the line, but I try to do so in the name of what's right. Most of the time, the ends justifies the means. But in this case, I feel like I betrayed my own code of ethics. And for that, sugar, I apologize.
<Dman> Patricia Nixon: But I shot at you. I tried to kill you, Black Dynamite. Black Dynamite: This is true, but you did not connect. You shot a plate. Had you connected, pimp-slapping you into that china cabinet might have been justified. But I feel I crossed the line. And for that, please accept my apology. Patricia Nixon: I do. I do, it's just... oh, Black Dyna

<Bjornfot> inb4 elky gets violently kicked again
<Dman> YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY~~~~~~
<RobotPinkie> So... playing more Amnesia, or listening to Fluttershy singing "yay" repeatedly....
<Elky> fluttershy just seems like a boring character
<Combustiblelemons> suddenly elky was hated.
<HaveDynomyteWillTravel> Hey, love and tolerate guys
<Ziltoid> ya
<Dman> according to fraps, this livestream is going at 11FPS :P
*Dermathil has a rocket-powered military-grade lawnchair with civilian-grade comfort that can take trolls to the moon in a single shot.
<RobotPinkie> I just can't resist Fluttershy. :(
<[Ger]Brony1> Report to Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie Pie said your number is up.
<Dman> funfact right there
<Dman> well, 15 - 20 odd now
<ColonelFedora> Yeah! Pinkie Pie is the best pony anyway...
<Axel_Foaley> Fluttershy is boring, but essential.
<Hipster_Brony> 8LOUDER!
<Destructor236> I'mma love and tolerate da SHIT otta ya brotha!Ya dig it?
<Dman> LOOOOUDDEEEEEER!
<Dman> HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
<prince-dari> Loudeer
<Elky> her 'character developement' just seems like 'let's make her the complete oppostie of wht she normally is'
<Dman> yay~
<Dermathil> *me also has a wind-powered netgun.
<Combustiblelemons> They need to develop her more I think
<Dman> what now?
<interior_gummy> GIC
<Dman> YAY
*Dermathil also has a wind-powered netgun.
<Ziltoid> MOAR FLUTTERSHY

<Hipster_Brony> 8fuck owl city
<Bjornfot> <3
<Combustiblelemons> YES!
<Elky> not very three-dimensioanal to me
<HaveDynomyteWillTravel> I see your point, Elky. I hate when shows do that.
*Dman doth quite believe that SirSprinkles has exquisite taste
<Combustiblelemons> UMAD hipster?
<RainbowLoon> <3
<Darky> 06i'm testing some stuff now, going to tdo a live stream again
<Combustiblelemons> *trollface*
<Destructor236> Suddenly,Fluttershy!Millions of her!
<Sathi> 7such a cute picture <3
<Darky> 06but this time without music
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay :)
<sklar> Dermathil i live on moon base alpha yuour agurment is invalids
<Darky> 06but with live commentary
<Dman> TEN MILLION FLUTTERSHIES
<Dman> : D
<AppleDash> Needs Billy Hays
<HaveDynomyteWillTravel> Hopefully the gala was just a one-off. Let's face it, the show is too popular to get canceled before season 4 or so
<Dman> + what Sathi said, that picture
<Elky> but I'm sure Fluttershy will have awesome episodes in S2
<Combustiblelemons> Enough fluttershy for everyone!
<HaveDynomyteWillTravel> So plenty of time to become 3D
<Elky> so it's okay
<Rezo-channer> The gala was almost certainly a one-off.
<Dermathil> Sklar: I can get myself over to oyur base and banish you on Mars with it.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Too much cuteness!
<prince-dari> Wow, this is incredibly well done.
<Darky> 06anyone who want to watch: http://www.livestream.com/lusgamehouse
<Dermathil> So it is still pretty much valid. YOurs aint tho
<Dman> pegasi : D
<prince-dari> Sounds just as legitimate as the official song

<Darky> 06oh, there is a HD option too, if i'm right
<Destructor236> WATCH OUT I'M EATING A BAGEL.1800 00000 Fluttershys on the way!
<G> Why is it not the version with Mithent singing... x)
<prince-dari> And I don't even like the original song.
<Dermathil> BAGELS ARE TASTING GEWD
<Elky> I even can deal with this song even though I hate it usually
<Dermathil> GIMME
<AppleDash> Celestia's going to get so mad that she's going to banish you to the moon's moon
<Rezo-channer> Although in fairness, Fluttershy's imbalance was heavily foreshadowed in other episodes (Sonic Rainboom and the cockatrice episode in particular).
<Nittany_Tiger_> Suddenly Fluttershys.
<Combustiblelemons> My new song to help me sleep.
<RainbowLoon> this voice is 20% cuter
<Dman> Fluttershy is awesome
<Dman> nuff said
<Bjornfot> Fluttershy snuggling me to sleep... WINGEST BLADE
<sklar> Dermathil i fight for the liberation of mars death to the EDF so yeah your argument is invalid
*HaveDynomyteWillTravel brohoofs Dman
*Dman double brohoofs HaveDynomyteWillTravel
<RainbowLoon> eternal boner

*Nittany_Tiger_ has played all Red Factions except Armageddon.
<Elky> I keep teelling myself it's just a show,,, but it's way too life.changing for that
<Bjornfot> Good, Nittany_Tiger_. Don't.
<Combustiblelemons> exactly.
<Destructor236> I medusa'd a cockatrice because it froze Fluttershy when i brought her into Super Scribblenauts.
<Dermathil> Sklar: want a one-way ticket to the Adeptus Mechanicus? They are essentially the only allowed independent group from the Imperium of Man. And they're on Mars.
<AppleDash> I must go to my chamber of understanding to identidy this pony ID code
<Elky> dammit
<sklar> This whole song is good an all but what happens to contrys that dont love fluttershy
<Combustiblelemons> The brony community never ceases to amaze me.
<Combustiblelemons> I love all you guys ^_^
<Dman> sklar We use the orbital friendship cannon on them!

<HaveDynomyteWillTravel> Because Europe, Elky
<Combustiblelemons> Europe has the best internets that's why.
*Dermathil has a holoblade extend from his forearm.
<Elky> because europe
<Elky> yes
<HaveDynomyteWillTravel> Also because it's earlier, and we're more alert = more able to enjoy movies
<Dermathil> datface
<Dman> Elky maybe cuz there's less pepole overall, and a higher proportion of viewers are participating in chat
*Dermathil continues to bob.
*Dermathil has a neckache
<EspyLacopa> The farmers of rock.
<Elky> (appledash threads ftw)
<AppleDash> show me your hooves
<prince-dari> Hurry, he's already gone.
<Armads> watching mythbusters whilst working is proving counterproductive.
*Dermathil continues regardless.
<prince-dari> hurr*
<RainbowLoon> <3
<Dman> SPRINKLES MY FAVOURITE PMV!
<prince-dari> :P
<Bjornfot> RANDOM PONY TRIVIE: "Alicorn" is NOT a winged unicorn. It is a substance of which a unicorn horn is made of.
<RainbowLoon> fast pace headbob
<Elky> yeah, the fewer people are probably the key factor
<interior_gummy> a whole 5 hours gone, and still no gic
<Combustiblelemons> *seizure dance party time*
<AppleDash> at this rate my head is going to snap off my neck
*Dman runs 7 miles everysaturday (+3erryday blah blah). Dman ran 7 miles on a saturday with JUST this on loop.
*Dermathil has his neckthrusts go rapidfire speed.
<Dman> I LOVE DIS VID AND SONG
<Elky> we don't have to spew random memes to get noticed
<interior_gummy> GIC
<Dman> UNT UNT UNT UNT
<interior_gummy> GIC
<interior_gummy> GIC
<Bjornfot> Anypony who claims alicorn=winged unicorn: please show proof
<HaveDynomyteWillTravel> Woah, seven miles? Dman, you have my reverence.
<Destructor236> HOLY SHIT SHE SNOTED COCAINE!
<Aurora> 6you should send that theory in to be busted
<Dman> Thankya havedynomytewilltravel
<SheenaFox> You're going to just end up blowing up whatever you're working on
<Destructor236> Snowflame is pleased.
<Dman> it's true : D
<Dermathil> if you wanna get noticed, be natural or make yourself a persona that you will stick to in chat. Aka my Rawkit Lawnchairs.
<RainbowLoon> i'd be not surprised if she snorted wasabi powder
<Dman> doing today's run after livestream.
<Elky> I don't plan on leaving my home tomorrow

<Dman> You take some shit, put it up on the wall, check it out for a while. You take that shit up off of the wall, put it down on the floor in a glass bowl. You take some fuck, put it up on the wall where the shit used to be. You take that fuck up off of the wall, put it down on the floor with the shit in a glass bowl What? Yo, here's another little piece of advice-
<DSNesmith> is it just designed to parody bad rap?

<Dman> yea
<Combustiblelemons> yes
<Dman> the guy who does this is HILLARIOUS dsnesmith

<Dman> You take some fuck then some shit then some fuck then some shit You've got a fuck-shit stack A fuck-shit stack Take some fuck then some shit then some fuck then some shit You've got a fuck-shit stack A fuck-shit stack
<Dman> It's a stack of fuck-shit on top of itself, nigga I make references to weaponry, ancient or new. I wear bullet-proof vests for no apparent reason other than to create a false sense of importance of which I could never retain on my own. I like to create a buffer memory of incredulity So y'all motherfuckers could never get near to me.
*Link escapes
<prince-dari> Now you know how I feel with Hipster's bright yellow text on white. :P
*Link flees
<Dman> I'm a cartoon character. You'll never be able to be like me! (me me) I like women I like women I like the concept of a woman I like to take that concept and reduce it to an object I like to take those objects and put 'em in my videos Have them shake they jiggly bits so they looks like hoes
<Dman> i think so dsnesmith, but youtube will show you aniways
<Dman> I like to take some car polish, smear it all over they asses and buff that shit out so it looks like fresh peaches and shit. I like to take some more of that car polish and smear it all over they tits and buff that shit out so it looks all sparkly, like diamond necklaces and shit. Why? Cuz I'm a lady's man a lady's man a la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lady's man
<Sathi> the horror! the horror!
<Bjornfot> Fluttershy confirmed for fillyfooler.
<Dman> lul
<Dman> I'm a materialist. I'm a materialist. I'll take a piece-of-shit car and I'll lower the motherfuckah; Put some 18-inch rims on the motherfuckah; Take some neon, put it underneath the motherfuckah so when I roll around this town it looks like a hover (hover hover)
<SirSprinkles> 6And DCD's bright green and Silver's light blue can't be much better.
<Link> LL save me D:
<Dman> I like to take a flat-panel display monitor, put one on the steering column, one inside of the glovebox, one on top of the dashboard, two in back of the headrests, one mounted in the ceiling, two still in the motherfucking packaging, on the back seat so when my motherfucking friends go and sit on the shit and break it (word?) I can honestly say:
<Sathi> so just enable author viewing then ;0
<Sathi> problem solved
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.

<Dman> Take some fuck then some shit then some fuck then some shit You've got a fuck-shit stack A fuck-shit stack Take some fuck then some shit then some fuck then some shit You've got a fuck-shit stack A fuck-shit stack It's a stack of fuck-shit on top of itself, nigga
<sklar> DSNesmith it talking how hip hop and rap are just using unoringinal bullshit and how it just downgrades women and how teaches you to idolize money and materiel objects
<Ziltoid> This song is so great

<prince-dari> XP
<Dermathil> AH
<eXAKR> I found a page on Google with someone saying her Wacom survived dog pulling it off the table
<Dermathil> forget me then. I use win7
<eXAKR> XD
<Sathi> goodnight SirSprinkles
<Ziltoid> winning?
<Destructor236> i use vista.
<Dermathil> I got derp all over your clothes.
<Sathi> See you tomorrow
<Bjornfot> >vista
<Bjornfot> get out.
<Dermathil> Vista is the bad kid between two awesome OS (XP and 7)
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Destructor236> i know
<Dermathil> Vista was horribly buggy.
<Skylands> 10That firework
<Dermathil> and unstable.
<Skylands> 10scared the crap outta me
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Destructor236> but i have no choice to use it.
<Sathi> 7win7 is 20% cooler
<Dermathil> win7 is the perfected version of Vista.
<Bjornfot> EVERYTHING microsoft makes is horribly buggy
<Light_Latias> 12those were just recently made legal here again :D
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Skylands> 10ALl the sudden I see a bright light outside the window
<prince-dari> So what's next?
<Armads> I love the first viewer special.
<Skylands> 10and loud boom
<Skylands> 10x.x
<Dermathil> And Win9 (or whatever name they'll give it) will be the perfected version of Win8
<Skylands> 10Wat Light
<eXAKR> Darky › "it was suposed to be a SEAL team that went in to kill osama, actually it was Chuck Norris" <- Chuck Norris could take on the entire Al-Qaeda alone
*eXAKR RUNS
<Destructor236> 360 is WAY more buggy than vista
<Armads> "dear adam and jamie, please blow up my parents' car"
<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Kl0Gr1VYQ
<Dermathil> Win8 being a shitty OS. That's the neverending loop.
<Bjornfot> that
<sklar> Im using someones computer which has vista it so derp
<Skylands> 10Oh, nvm...
<Darky> 06but i THINK Glacy eated them all
<Light_Latias> 12wat wat?
<Darky> 06LMFAO Armads
<Skylands> 10It's illegal to buy fireworks here
<Nittany_Tiger_> 7 has run worse on my computer than Vista.
<Skylands> 10But you can buy them from other states
<Destructor236> yeah!
<MidnightStar> 7 runs perfectly fine for me.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Sneas> 03I wish it was illegal here
<Dermathil> Nittany_Tiger: is the hardware optimized?
<Destructor236> l4s2!
<sklar> Yes
<Sneas> 03lolrednecks
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Is Prince-Dari broadcasting?

<Dermathil> BTW, I watched The End of time on my ipod.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> I love this
<Dermathil> What do you think of the episode that introduced the Oods, Prince-dari?
<prince-dari> GTFO president.
<prince-dari> The two parter? That was good.
<Bjornfot> >translating alien languages
<Bjornfot> logic=none
<Dermathil> hey Bjornfot
<prince-dari> I love how they left it as more of a mystery about what it was.
<Dermathil> Prince-dari: the YANA episode?
<Dermathil> whatcha think of it?
<Bjornfot> yes dermathil
<Dermathil> YOU ARE NOT ALONE
<Bjornfot> O SHI
<prince-dari> I dunno, I like just about all the Tennant episodes.
<Dermathil> yeah.
<Dermathil> The tennant-centric episodes are always kicking ass.
<prince-dari> Yana for was good because WHAT A TWEEST!
<Dermathil> yeah
<prince-dari> -for*
<Dermathil> I literally shat a brick when I saw that episode.
<prince-dari> Also I liked the Master because of the actor, same as life on mars main character.
<Dermathil> OH SNAP THEY BE GOING ON THE ROOFS
<Skylands> 10Nini
<Espeon> 06~
<prince-dari> Why is no one in the middle of a shower when this happens?
<prince-dari> WHERE'S THE NUDITY PEOPLE?! XD
<Bjornfot> inb4 massive suicide
<Dermathil> 6AM: still sleeping?
<prince-dari> SOMEONE would be in the middle of a shower.
<Dermathil> OH HECK THEY ARE GONNA GO TO THE ROOF
<Dermathil> Prince-dari: the aliens have got a sense of clothes?
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Dermathil> They know that a naked person's gonna make the others laugh whatever happens, taking them out of their stupor?
<prince-dari> Interesting excuse. XD
<prince-dari> I suppose that could work.
<prince-dari> Wait wut.
<prince-dari> Bearing in mind they have just lost a third of their staff.
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Dermathil> I've got some sort of warped logic at times that can succesfully explain that kind of plot holes.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Royal family on the roof.
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> this broadcast can be interpreted as a call to the best medical doctor on the planet by non-knowing people.
<prince-dari> Lol, yeah.
<Dermathil> NO HE AIN'T, ROSE.

*Dermathil is a B- bloodtype. He continues to live his day as normal, watching ponies while others go on the roofs.
<Bjornfot> >LOL USA THINKS THEY RULE THE WORLD
<prince-dari> EeeeeeeeeNOPE
<prince-dari> They look JUST like us.
<prince-dari> XD
<Dermathil> Even though I live in North America, I tend to think the British have done more for the history of mankind than the US did.
<Dermathil> aka CANADIAN
<prince-dari> America hasn't had that much time to do anything.
<Dermathil> exactly
<Dermathil> so they don't deserve to be leading.
<prince-dari> Compared to Britain, but I won't pretend to know history anyway. XD
<Bjornfot> USA don't have any history worthy of mention.
<Dermathil> Canada was a british colony before it recieved its independence WITHOUT VIOLENCE.
<Dermathil> we were so liked by the british that we were offered our independence.
<Ziltoid> well not really
<Sneas> 03DDDDD:
<Dermathil> Ziltoid: care to elaborate?
<Bjornfot> IMO it would be better if at least USA stayed a colony.
<Ziltoid> If I remember anything at all
<Ziltoid> IN quebec atleast there was a war
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: the US's history is all-over the guns.
<Dermathil> Ziltoid: that was was in 1760. That's when we went from the french to the English
<Ziltoid> Right
<Dermathil> Apart from that, no independence war.
<Dermathil> We didn't separate from the British empire through war.
<Dermathil> EPICNESS MOMENT RIGHT THERE
<Bjornfot> At least Canada understands that you can get your ways without HURR DURR VIOLENCE
<Dermathil> exactly.
<Dermathil> Well, we could understand that before our current prime minister.
<Nittany_Tiger_> America may not last much longer as a world player.
<Dermathil> That guy's almost as bad as Bush in my eyes.
<Ziltoid> lol
<prince-dari> "olololololololo"
<prince-dari> U so stupid
<Ziltoid> Nope
<Ziltoid> ,jpg
<Nittany_Tiger_> Does Canada have a greed problem?
<Dermathil> Nittany_Tiger: we have got a prime minister who's a huge conservative dick.
<Ziltoid> eeyup
<Dermathil> HECK YES
<Ziltoid> jets are cool lets buy some
<Nittany_Tiger_> At least you're not destroying the world for profit.
<Dermathil> DAVID TENNANT IN 100% AWESOME

<Dman> yea but dermathil i'm on 100% volume and when I Play it native mah pc it's LOUDDDD O GOD then low livestream
<Espeon> 06I tried the old one x.x
<prince-dari> To be fair it depends your speaker volume.
<Dman> prince-dari so it's not your computer, it's the livestream?
<Bjornfot> Just amplify all outgoing audio...
<Ascendant> lmfao
<prince-dari> It's the stream, yeah.
<prince-dari> Bjornfot: Like I said I could use VAC.
<Dman> : / i cna't help at all then really
<prince-dari> But meh.
<Dermathil> Dman: I'm 100% volume though, on the physical sound control on my headset, on my sound controls, on my keyboard, on my screen, 4 layers of 100% sound.
<prince-dari> I'll set it up some other time.
<Bjornfot> then stop being lazy dari
<Espeon> 06and that worked ofc
<nickstr> I am going to try an experiment with aDosBox
<nickstr> lets see how good it really is
<Polarfire> oh bjornfot
<Polarfire> you so silly
<Dermathil> oh heck yeah, the pizza delivery scene. Good one.
<nickstr> can it run Windows 95 and Windows 3.11?
<Dman> Dermathil wow 4 layers. so i'm 100percent too and i can barely hear, but still hear, this stream
<Dman> Prince-dari ask what settings others use?
<drf|laptop> 03a few of the reviews say it's really sluggish
<Dman> Pizza Time
<Manlyguy> So when is the Tf2 game? xD
<Dermathil> I hear the stream, but I don't hear it loud.
<Bjornfot> needs to be about 20% louder
<prince-dari> Look, I'll set up VAC or something for next week...
<Dermathil> this scene is one of the awesomer in the pilot.
<Dman> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-dk1axrNmqU/S1Zp-_jf0oI/AAAAAAAAKFU/uaGj2DPEzxk/s400/pizzatime.jpg
<Dman> Dermathil same
<Ascendant> hah
<Espeon> 06okay, now I think I got the server started at least =w=
<Dman> Lol, but prince-dari maybe you should compare your settings with people like sprinkles and DCD ?
<Espeon> 06and somehow I accidentally whoised people okay
<prince-dari> There's nothing to compare.
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<prince-dari> I've got the volume setting at 100% for everything.
<drf|laptop> 03Ascendant
<drf|laptop> 03question
<Dman> but there's so many livestream settings to tweak? oh ok then
<Espeon> 06yay it's up
<Dman> : /
<drf|laptop> 03how do I see connects/disconnects without being oper?
<Dermathil> welcome, to the HUB
<Bjornfot> Do you use the same streaming program?
<prince-dari> Yes.
<Dman> Dermathil this the hub?
<prince-dari> THE HAND!
<Dermathil> The Torchwood hub.
<Dman> NO
<Dermathil> yes, the hand
<Ascendant> uh...
<Dman> is that genuinely the same hand?
<Dman> No wai
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<sotha> I thought this was the brony HUB?
<Dermathil> I think it is.
<Ascendant> technically you only need the cF snomasks
<prince-dari> Jack kept it.
<Polarfire> hmm I expected this room to be empty pretty much
<drf|laptop> 03I know there's +E for the whois thing
<Polarfire> but anyway
<Dman> why am i a huge fan of dr who yet never got into torchwood
<drf|laptop> 03but that seems to only work when someone's on the same server I am
<Dman> wow i thought the master just took it
<drf|laptop> 03if it's the other server, nothing happens :/
<sotha> different target audience?
<Ascendant> and yes, ocean needs it installed
<Dman> i dunno
<Ascendant> until Draelen installs it on ocean it won't work properly
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Dermathil> Dman: because torchwood is for older people?
<drf|laptop> 03I couldn't have +W without being oper, could I?
<Dman> i always thought 'torchwood sucks it's to fill in when dr who aint on' but never saw it
<drf|laptop> 03just because people \are bawwing over me being opered up right now
<Dman> : (
<Dermathil> (Though I did start watching torchwood at 4 years old)
<drf|laptop> 03but I like having those alerts
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<Ascendant> woops, I just killed the TF2 server
<Dman> it has no doctor
<Dman> : /
<Dman> thta may be a reason why
<Espeon> 06WALLOPS EVERYWHERE
<Espeon> 06and how
<Espeon> 06did you do that D:
<Dermathil> Dman: it's got Jack Harkness.
<Dermathil> And they do reference the doctor at multiple times.
<Dman> pizza under the name of torchwood : D
<Dermathil> Also, Martha Jones makes a few cameos
<drf|laptop> 03LOL wallops?
<Dman> and yea Dermathil it sure has
<Dman> yea i saw them ones or some of those
<Dman> Following the character's initial introduction in the revived Series One of Doctor Who, the character became incredibly popular with fans,[6][102][142] to the extent that Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner created a spin-off series, Torchwood, primarily centred around the character
<Dman> so this show is about jack?
<Dermathil> yeah
*Quanyails 7grabs a cup of apple juice.
<Dman> oh i thout it was about many people here
<Dermathil> he's immortal.
<Dman> oh ok
<Dman> and ya lul
<Dermathil> Dman: well about him and this specific girl here.
<Dermathil> The only two main characters of the pilot to still be around after The children of earth
<prince-dari> It's about the whol torchwood team. :P
<prince-dari> whole*
<Dermathil> PTERODACTYL
<Ziltoid> So none watches fringe?
<Dermathil> nope
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Ziltoid> sadface
<Kyu> 07o.o
<Dman> ' In "The Parting of the Ways", Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips,[5] the latter being the first same-sex kiss in the history of the programme.' lol wikipedia
*Quanyails 7returns. o.O
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Kyu!
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Espeon> 06mfw the lugia.us server is the one in my fav list with the best ping
<Dman> Dermathil: oh i see so that's pilot ep and she introduced?
<Dman> ok
<Kyu> 07lol
<Espeon> 06I feel spoiled
<Ascendant> and nope, I didn't
<Dermathil> yeah
<Ascendant> lmao
*Kyu pats Greg
<Dermathil> This is the first episode in the torchwood series.
*Espeon rolls
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Dman> wow 'Readers of AfterElton.com, an American gay men's website, voted Jack the tenth best gay or bisexual television character of all time, the poll itself ultimately being won by Queer as Folk character Brian Kinney (also the product of Russell T Davies). ' russell t davies writes gay characters lol
<Quanyails> 7Well, you're in Europe.
<Espeon> 06yes and most people are
<Espeon> 06not
<Espeon> 06so xD
<Quanyails> 7I have a feeling the CaliClan will be a little less pleased. XD
<Dermathil> maybe
<Ascendant> uh
<Bjornfot> TV seriously needs more lgbt
<Ascendant> the server is in germany
<Ascendant> :x
<Espeon> 06CURVE THE BULLET time
<Kyu> 07lol o3o
<Espeon> 06because lag compensation is totally fair
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: we are still in a period of time where they were only recently equalized in society.
<Ascendant> it's a pretty fast server
<Quanyails> 7It's better than having laggy people get killed all the time./
<Bjornfot> and diversity in general
<Espeon> 06Yes it is, but it does lead to some amusing headshot-around-corners moments.
<Dermathil> In about two more decades this should have more diversity. At most in half a century.
<Bjornfot> In USA, maybe. We're far ahead in the rest of the world.
<Espeon> 06And backstabbed-mid-rocketjump
<Dermathil> History takes time to write itself.
<Espeon> 06but it's the lesser of two evils for sure :p
<Quanyails> 7Ahem.
<prince-dari> USA is ahead?
<prince-dari> Wut.
<Bjornfot> USA is way too conservative and hurr durr.
<Dermathil> ^^
<Dman> UK forthewin
<Quanyails> 7Can I guess you have IRC invites off?
<Dman> i guess
<Dermathil> that and the canadian Prime Minister. He's also ultra-conservative.
<Bjornfot> prince, re-read my sentence, i thinkk you got it wrong
<Darky> 06LOL
<Espeon> 06I probably do if you're asking me LOL
<Darky> 06xD
<Dermathil> This backdoor was my first awesome feeling for the series.
<Espeon> 06oh nvm
<Espeon> 06I just didn't see them
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Polarfire> oh yeah we're conservative that's why we're trillions of dollars in the hole.
<Ascendant> it's kinda hard to see
<Polarfire> :p
<Ascendant> because nobody looks at their status window
<Dman> bjornfot where you from?
<Bjornfot> no that's just because you suck
<Bjornfot> Sweden
<Dman> i see
<Espeon> 06it doesn't go 4red6 sooo
<Dman> now i can understand that sentence
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> it goes blue
<Ascendant> or brown
<Dman> prince dari i may want sleep soon as i g2 get up at 10 and not sleep for a day : (
<Ascendant> or some other colour depending on your theme
<Espeon> 06blue because blue = top tier
<Bjornfot> We're like, the LGBTQ-friendliest countries ever.
<Dman> i'm tireeeeeed
*Quanyails 7pokes NightSeas.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Bjornfot> here in scandinavia
<Dermathil> Who feels bad for Oslo?
*Quanyails 7pokes Feather
*Quanyails 7pokes not-here Aurora.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I don't mind homosexuals. I mind them showing off their homosexuality. I don't really care to hear about their sexual preference.
<Dman> Oslo?
<Bjornfot> except finland, they've had too much russia influence
<Espeon> 06and oi I should probably change my spray a bit...
*Espeon hides
*Quanyails 7pokes not-here Sheena.
<Dermathil> Dman: the terrorist attack on Oslo
<Dman> I don't mind them, they can do what they want. I just don't like it when they go 'I'M GAY OK DEALWITHIT JEES IT'S TWENTYFIRST CENTURY AND I'M GAY SO WHAT LEAVE ALONE YES I'M GAY' 'iml ike ok ok
<Dermathil> 80 kids gunned down on an island, 7 deaths to a bomb attack.
<Dman> oh
<Espeon> 06oh sh-
<Polarfire> nittany_tiger/ My thoughts exactly
<Bjornfot> Speaking of which... there should really be some fillyfooling in FiM.
<Dman> yes i heard about that
<Quanyails> 7?
<Dman> and mentioned it here actualy
<Espeon> 06"The server you're connecting to is running an older version of the game"
<Bjornfot> it makes incredibly much sense
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> the vphysics.so is from an old version
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: no there shouldn'T be fillyfooling in FiM. No relations altogether except the comedic Spike-rarity. This is still a kids show.
<Bjornfot> and kids need to be taught that it's not wrong or disgusting or against some fictional character's will
<Dman> there's no real relationship muc hin FIM at all
<Ascendant> unless a new version of the server has come out since 2 days ago
<Espeon> 06well, yes
<Dman> we see pinkie's parents twi's parents um
<Dermathil> As much interwebs coverage it gets, kids still watch it.
<Darky> 06mmhmm
<Ascendant> it shouldn't be an issue
<Dman> aj's auntuncle
<Darky> 06update today
<Ziltoid> oh hai im immortal
<Ascendant> -___________-
<Espeon> 06in fact physics involving FLOATING DISSOLVING PEOPLE
<Dman> mr and mrs cake
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Darky> 06xD
<Dermathil> To see fillyfooling we'd need a scene on screen.
<Dman> there's not exactly a million straight relationships as is
<Ascendant> god damn it
<Dermathil> Dman: People see Lyra and Bonbon.
<Dman> but yea fillyfooling in the show or coltcuddling for that matter would be fun to watch
*Lambda brohoofs prince-dari as a sign of welcome
<Bjornfot> So, why no (obvious) same-sex pairs?
<Dman> Dermathil lolyes, quite accepted in fanbase, but canon? : /
*prince-dari brohoofs Lambda back.
<Lambda> :P
<Ziltoid> theres lara and bonbon
<Bjornfot> Lyra and BonBOn is confrimed for coincidence
<Ziltoid> sort of
<Dman> see, derpy became canon. djpon3 became canon, but lyra x bonbon hastn't yet : /
<Lambda> how's it going?
<Espeon> 06what I don't get is
<Polarfire> dari: i hear your windows noises :P
<Espeon> 06we could connect earlier today
<Dman> DUN
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: no obvious pairs because the parents haven'T explained what that is yet to their kids.
<prince-dari> It's people highlighting me. :P
<Ascendant> well the server crashed
<Nittany_Tiger_> ^
<Dman> in what?
<Nittany_Tiger_> His IRC client
<prince-dari> Good thanks.
<Lambda> I thinm I'm going to continue watching all the episodes again tonight
<Dman> cuz msn doesn't make that noise or face book or steam or ... oh ok
<prince-dari> How about you?
<Ziltoid> prince-dari
<Dermathil> Prince-dari
<prince-dari> Ahh, nice. :D
<Lambda> it's been a while since I've watched them

<Dermathil> Prince-dari
<Dermathil> Prince-dari
<Dermathil> Prince-dari

<Lambda> I'll consult the MLP wikli
<Lambda> *wiki
<prince-dari> :P
<Lambda> oh also
<Dman> >music
<Dermathil> TORCHWOOD THEME
<Bjornfot> What if some kid gets a crush on someone of the same sex think he's a freak because he's never heard of such a thing, only ever seen opposite-sex relations on cartoons?
<Espeon> 06Yeah
<prince-dari> Dragonshy episode 7 I think.
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: then that's the parent's job to explain that.
<Lambda> I use reddit, and look what I discovered earlier this week http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony
<Polarfire> bjornfot you are such a troll :p
<prince-dari> ,,,
<Dermathil> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Wut
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Dman> is this the end of the peisode?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Advertisement fail.
<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFU
<Dman> oh this has a limit too?
<Dermathil> That's megavideo
<Dman> Prince-dari SECOND I@LL FIND ANOTHA ONE
<Nittany_Tiger_> No.
<prince-dari> MFW it's not megavideo.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Pay for everything fail.
<prince-dari> It's "videobb".
<Dman> whaaa
<Dermathil> did you watch anything on there?
<Polarfire> hmmm... Lets stream some ponies!
<Dman> http://www.novamov.com/video/k21fjalxlgouc
<Dman> GOGOGOGOGO
<Dermathil> hahah
<Dman> HAVE NO FEAR DMAN IS HERE
<Dman> and HAhahaha
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZn8-4wqqw
<Ziltoid> lol
<Dman> and yes, i found another link in 10 seconds flat. Jelly?
<nickstr> ok here we go
*Dman is helping mods. :3
<Nittany_Tiger_> Game are going to subscription services, and I'm getting sad.
<Lambda> ooh yay
<Dman> Prince-dari you can skip ahead in that stream, so find where we were and yea...
<prince-dari> MFW that's miracle day again?
<Lambda> the slumber party episode is next
<Bjornfot> I can understand why you don't want to focus on relationships in a kids cartoon... but if there's "normal" innocent crushes, why can't there be same-sex ones?
<Dman> miracle day?
<prince-dari> It's the BBC page.
<prince-dari> With miracle day.
<Dman> http://www.novamov.com/video/k21fjalxlgouc
<prince-dari> :P
<Dman> novanov
<Dman> no it's novanov >_<
<Dman> yes this one
<Dermathil> Prince-dari: let's watch this scene to remind ourselves of well-done musicals: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwoLNtUuCVk
<Ziltoid> Gonna go on drawball dont mind me
<Dman> silly prince-dari can't pc : D
<Ziltoid> http://two.drawball.com/
<nickstr> so far so good
<prince-dari> :P
<Bjornfot> Homosexuality should not be considered or portrayed as odd or abnormal.
<Dman> prince-dari you can skip ahead
<Dman> doo eet : )
<Dman> SUDDENLY kissing
<Nittany_Tiger_> I think putting same-sex relationships in the cartoon (or in any cartoon) will just create a shitstorm of backlash.
<Ziltoid> lol
<Dman> 'do you wanna do that really' 'you basterd'
<Dman> epic skipping prince-dari ; )
<nickstr> but no luck
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: it isn't, just a matter that is needed to be explained by the parents to the children, not by a cartoon aimed at 5-years olds.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Especially when the conservatives of my religion get word of this.
<Polarfire> putting homosexuality in a kids cartoon...
<nickstr> I need to change the mounting for the /sdcard/ directory
<Bjornfot> Yes it will, Nittany_Tiger_. But why? Because of fat old conservative bastards. Who should die.
<Dman> wait...when i say your name everypony hears DUN. i'l stop calling you then by ur name :(
<prince-dari> XD
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: also, the television industry probably would censor the episode.
<Polarfire> O BOI HURR WE GO
<Dermathil> louder video
<Polarfire> Bjornfot are you communist?
<Bjornfot> Why should the parents have to explain something that's pretty usual?
<Dman> sowwee. i found this vid in 10 secs flat. must become 20% faster thus find vids in 8 seconds flat
<Bjornfot> hell no polarfire i'm libertarian
<Nittany_Tiger_> Capitalist greed sometimes makes me want to become socialist.
<Dman> so Dermathil any other cool scenes left here?
<Bjornfot> Capitalism<>Right-wing
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm already almost put off by republicans.
<Dermathil> not that I remember.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Of
<Dman> Pony<>Pony
<prince-dari> And then they fucked
<Ziltoid> what just happened?
<Bjornfot> I'm not saying we should force cartoons to incorporate homosexuality... I'm just saying that it would be good if they did.
<Polarfire> As far as political parties go, I have none.
<Nittany_Tiger_> We shouldn't force anything on anyone.
<Lambda> I found a video a while back that was all the episodes in one video
<Nittany_Tiger_> Forcing things on people makes people angry.
<Bjornfot> Of course they never will because of conservative american christian idiots.
<Polarfire> I have my set of beliefs about anything and everything anyone would want to discuss, and I stick to them.
<prince-dari> If you want FiM to get shut down FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEVEEEEEEEEER it's a good idea. :P
<Lambda> it was nice not having to click the next episode on the list
<Lambda> can't find it now
<Polarfire> ^that
<prince-dari> LOL
<Dman> i agree a little with bjornfot, it would be cute to see lyra kiss bonbon on the cheek or something
<Ziltoid> wut
<Lambda> oh
<Dermathil> Bjornfot: it is just something that is usually taboo around kids. Both hetero and Homo.
<Lambda> spoke too soon
<prince-dari> There's your homosexuality Bjornfot.
<Bjornfot> it wouldn't be shut down if people used their brains a little and stopped being derp
<prince-dari> Same sex kissing, you happy? :P
<Polarfire> It would be creepy in the show.
<Dman> FOR THE RECORD I'M STRAIGHT >_< desu
<Bjornfot> FOR THE RECORD I'M OMNISEXUAL DESU
<Dman> it would be either creepy as hell, polarfire, or really really cute cuz of vector animashun
<Dermathil> straight too.
<Nittany_Tiger_> FTR: I'm Christian
<Dermathil> HARKNESS ON ROOF IS AWESOME
<prince-dari> There isn't even any hetero kissing in MLP.
<Dermathil> THAT I REMEMBER NOW
<Nittany_Tiger_> And I'm tolerant of all sexual preferences.
<Dman> haha, now everpony doesn't want doubts around their sexuality so eveyone's just saying
<Nittany_Tiger_> And religions.
<prince-dari> And I don't see why there should be any kissing at all.
<Dman> i'm tolerant ... and loving badumtiss
<Bjornfot> there shouldn't
<Nittany_Tiger_> The only thing I don't tolerate is hate against my religion.
<Dman> i'm ok with season 2 not having kisses
<Nittany_Tiger_> Which is growing.
<Nittany_Tiger_> And upsetting.
<Bjornfot> guess why nittany, guess why
<Dman> unless...rarity kissing spike on cheek for thankyou CIUUUUUTE
<Nittany_Tiger_> Conservative extremists.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I know why.
<Bjornfot> It's because many religious people are conservative idiots. homophobes and such
<Nittany_Tiger_> The "Hate everyone that's not Christian" people.
<Dman> prince-dari who's streaman monday?
<Polarfire> seeing lyra kiss bon bon is something I would not mind seeing made by the animators per-say. However I DON'T want to see it in the show anytime soon.
<prince-dari> Wait, when does Rarity kiss Spike?
<Polarfire> because it would be creepy as hell
<Dman> i'm saying it wud be cute in season 2
<Bjornfot> she doesn't
<prince-dari> On Monday probably Sprinkles.
<Dman> it would be cute in season 2 >_< just a peck on cheek for thanks. cuz we were talking about season 2 kissing
<Dman> Sprinkles ok
<Dman> primary bl4d3
<Dermathil> Nittany: I don't really like the christian religion around my area. THey may have basically controlled the political scene half a century ago, some of the people around and some priests raped kids. I personally made myself Atheist since I don't think people should believe the bible by the letter.
<Dman> Dermathil or prince does this have stuff like dr who where some season 1 thing apperas in season 3/4/5?
<Bjornfot> But anyway... Spike has an innocent crush on Rarity...
<nickstr> IT WORKS
<Dermathil> yeah, Dman.
<nickstr> DOSBOX FOR ANDROID WILL BOOT WINDOWS 95!
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Sheena.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Political agendas have corrupted Christian leaders.
<Dman> coool sweeet
<Dermathil> The glove, for example, comes back later.
<SheenaFox> hi Quan
<Lambda> the first time I watched through the season I didn't watch the opening credits
<Dman> What nittany said
<Lambda> now I am
<HyperMetalLugia> YAY
*Quanyails 7POKES Feather.
<prince-dari> Muuuuuuuuuuuuch later.
<Quanyails> 7I see you're on. o3o
<Bjornfot> I could totally see an episode about falling in love for your idol or something. Scoot goes crazy over Dash.
<HyperMetalLugia> So how well does it run?
<Dman> u srs? i'm liking this show more and more
<SheenaFox> yeah, I am o3o
<Dman> but NewDCD linked me to a buncha supersentai shows that i too wanna watch
<Dman> what watch?
<drf|laptop> 03OK so

<junh1024-XD> duno
<Dermathil> I can't say. I hate torrents for robbing my interweb.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I used to use BitTorrent.
<Dman> arguable, but there are genuinely massive differences in speed that can be achieved
<Dermathil> WHO SAID DARIS NAME
<Bjornfot> lolwat dermathil
<junh1024-XD> drf has a santrex FTP

<Dermathil> Bjornfot: my internet is capped, and I get tops of 300$/month.
<Dman> what
<Dman> you pay 300 a month?
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm not a torrenter, but I used to be.
<Dman> also dermathil if it's capped and you're on a livestream isn't that rather taxing?
<Nittany_Tiger_> And, honestly, trying to be an honest consumer doesn't lead anywhere anymore.
<Bjornfot> Dermathil... then automatically stop the torrent after it's done? Prevent it from seeding?
<Dermathil> Dman: 300$/month for going over the cap.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Except exploitation and accusation.
<Dman> nittany i still buy loads of torrentable stuff of course
<Dman> oh ouch dermathil
<Dermathil> we are also 3 heavy internet users on the same broadband

<nickstr> I don't think WIFI tunneling works in this version
<Dermathil> yes, Dman.
<Nittany_Tiger_> And with anime, I only torrented fansubs.
<Dman> dermathil wow
<Dermathil> Any bigger cap than what we already have and we get the business contract
<Ziltoid> thats only for uploads right?
<Dman> >resurrection for the whole world isn't taht good. that's the worst idea ever mate
<Bjornfot> suddenly, guy out of the ground

<Ascendant> lol that
<Polarfire> what meme?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Of course, she was just asking how I was.
<Ascendant> talking about me? ):
<Dashite> Heh, last night everyone was a stuck up pony except for me.

<Jaunty_Scribbles> Hi everypony!
<prince-dari> YES!
<Polarfire> XD
<Ziltoid> hello
<prince-dari> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Nittany_Tiger_> Steven_Magnet finally speaks sense.
<Dashite> Much better. :p
<Polarfire> ohai!
<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soAk3F0wX9s
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I just got here
<Dashite> Hey
<Polarfire> does your mom know you are a brony?
<Ziltoid> you are damn late
<Jaunty_Scribbles> ^_^
<Polarfire> nittany?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Nope.
<eXAKR> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 12 minutes and has to fly eXAKR around until then
<Dashite> Oh god no.
<Ziltoid> nope.avi
<eXAKR> Come out now.
<Ziltoid> lol
<Jaunty_Scribbles> My mom will find out tomorrow when all my friends come over and the subject comes up
<Bjornfot> We should watch some 3.5G episode sometime.
<prince-dari> My family knows.
<Polarfire> My family is clueless
<Nittany_Tiger_> I thought of sending her a pony episode, but I decided not too.
<Ziltoid> how many of these videos are there?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Honestly, it's no big deal to me if she finds out.
<Polarfire> yeah -_-
<Dashite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZGajz8cgi4
<Polarfire> hmm
<prince-dari> Gottta share?
<prince-dari> YOU GOTTA CARE!
<prince-dari> YOU GOTTA SHARE!
<Ascendant> lmfao drf
<Ziltoid> its the right thing to do
<Nittany_Tiger_> I find it funny how adults liking Spongebob (including my mom) was not nearly as negatively received as adults loving MLP.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> LOL
<Jaunty_Scribbles> OH SHI-
<Jaunty_Scribbles> YOU GOTTA CAAAARE!
<Jaunty_Scribbles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o3TTuGrYuQ
<Polarfire> fukc der poliec
<Dashite> I don't think my family knows just how much pony stuff I watch, but they do know a little.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Unless MLP is being spammed everywhere.
<Polarfire> I've dropped a few pony memes into conversations before
<MidnightStar> You gotta shaaaarrreeee
<eXAKR> Glacymr your keyboard is loud.
<Polarfire> but my family isn't meme savvy XD
<Nittany_Tiger_> I haven't done any brony memes in verbal conversations. Just here and there on the internet.
<Sneas> 03DR. MARIO.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> MySpace is the ghetto of the internet now isn't it?
<Armageddon> lmao
<Nittany_Tiger_> Worst was when I was streaming Orbiter on Tinychat.
<Dashite> Myspace is a ghost town.
<Polarfire> I hum and play pony tunes on the piano all the time
<eXAKR> !glacymr
*Glacymr still belongs to eXAKR for 8 more minutes
<Nittany_Tiger_> I changed my nick to "Lunarescuesquad" since I was doing an Apollo mission.
<Polarfire> I was there XD
<prince-dari> ^
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Dari was there albeit silent.
<prince-dari> I did talk a bit. :P
<Nittany_Tiger_> I still haven't finished the run.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yeah.
<Polarfire> I was pretty silent also
<Nittany_Tiger_> I wonder if I could find and insert a Luna Statue at the landing site.
<prince-dari> That'd be cool.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I would have to make one in the format that Orbiter accepts.
<Polarfire> I want a shirt that has something subtle but pony related. That way other bronies will spot me but regular people won't.
<Ziltoid> well im off everypony goodbye
<Bjornfot> bye ziltoid
<Polarfire> bye bye ziltoid
<Nittany_Tiger_> I want a bracelet with a cross and RD cutie mark.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> LOL and Livejournal is the ancient abandoned ruins!
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Oooh! I know this vid!
<Jaunty_Scribbles> *Derp*
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Would it be made out of black marble? 'Cause that would be EPIC
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Get a shirt with just the cutie mark on it...Rainbow Dash's, for example
<Jaunty_Scribbles> And make sure it's a blue shirt
<Nittany_Tiger_> Too open.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> really?
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm quite a shy person.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> awwwr *patpat*
<Dashite> How much more subtle do you think you could get?
<Bjornfot> then get something fluttershy related x3
<Jaunty_Scribbles> You're probably a really cool person
<prince-dari> I'd not really comfortable telling my friends.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Maybe.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Get a shirt with the word "Yay" written in really small letters!
<prince-dari> Since they might tell other people and other people aren't always so nice. :P
<Nittany_Tiger_> Subtle would be a Rainbow Dash doll to put in my office.
<Nittany_Tiger_> A small one like those you get at McDonalds.
<Polarfire> other people are never nice
<Dashite> I know a few people in real life that I might be willing to talk about it with, but I don't think I'd bring it up myself.
<Polarfire> On the internet, bronies unite
<Polarfire> irl we are alone : P
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yeah.
<prince-dari> I'm gunna get a pony shirt.
<Polarfire> and rl is a scary place
<prince-dari> I'd on wear it going out with family though.
<Dashite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLDmI3ieauo non-pony but hell yes!
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I've met some bronies IRL before...we talked about being bronies and looked at the pics I had on my laptop
<Polarfire> not safe like the internet
<Nittany_Tiger_> I so want to meet some PA residents before I leave next year.
<prince-dari> And hope I don't run into any friends. XD
<Glacymr> 12!exakr
*eXAKR now belongs to Glacymr for 20 minutes
<Nittany_Tiger_> I know a lot of PA residents online.
<Nittany_Tiger_> But I haven't met any.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> There's quite a few bronies down here in Georgia
<eXAKR> Mutual owning
<Sneas> 038
<Glacymr> 12yeh i now
<Nittany_Tiger_> The only people I've met IRL from online are storm chasers.
<Bjornfot> stop complaining.
<Glacymr> 12know
<Bjornfot> you have no complaining rights if you live in USA
<prince-dari> Oh here we go again Bjornfot. :P
<Bjornfot> there's super many bronies there
<Dashite> How about Canada?
<Nittany_Tiger_> I have plenty to complain about in the USA.
<Bjornfot> nope
<Polarfire> bjornfot you are such a troll : P
<Nittany_Tiger_> Just not brony-related issues.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Aw, where are you from Bjorn?
<prince-dari> VIKING COUNTRY
<Bjornfot> oh yes Nittany_Tiger_, you have. but not about there being no bronies
<Dashite> Bjornfot is techno viking
<prince-dari> Do you have an epic bear Bjornfot?
<Bjornfot> eeyup
<prince-dari> beard*
<Nittany_Tiger_> Maybe "Love and Tolerance" can fix this fucking country.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> ....TROLL COUNTRY! (^_^)V
<Bjornfot> nah
<prince-dari> Aww.
<Bjornfot> it's kinda puny
<Bjornfot> I'm only 18
<prince-dari> >it's kinda puny
<prince-dari> Lul
<Polarfire> gorw eet strongur
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm 10 years on you.
*prince-dari takes rhat out of context
<prince-dari> that*
*Armads returns from cubeworld
<Jaunty_Scribbles> 30 >///<
<Dashite> I can grow a decent goatee, but that's it.
<Bjornfot> and I usually shave it
<prince-dari> MFW I'm always the youngest person.
<Bjornfot> but just not now cause it's summer brake
<Armads> now with lower sodium
<Polarfire> I have john lennon sideburns :3
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm nearly the steretypical brony. Just not super-obsessed with the show.
<Polarfire> What is the stereotypical brony?
<Nittany_Tiger_> I have a full beard and mustache.
<Polarfire> oh XD
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I'm in the Navy...we can't have facial hair.
<eXAKR> bbl
<Bjornfot> But I don't think I'd ever grow a real beard... it would decrease my chances of getting laid.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I just got back from a four-year stationing in Japan and Southeast Asia
<Dashite> That depends entirely on the beard.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Haters cast them as unemployed men in their 20s or 30s.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Well, that's Fox.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I PONYTIZED AT LEAST TWO JAPANESE WOMEN!
<Jaunty_Scribbles> ^_^
<Bjornfot> Actually, I haven't gotten laid since pony, but w/e
<Jaunty_Scribbles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwKclhWlo-0
<prince-dari> I liked the Fox coverage.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm a virgin.
<Dashite> I managed to get two people online hooked on pony.
<Dashite> That's it so far.
<Bjornfot> inb4 nittany waits until marriage
<Nittany_Tiger_> No-one likes Fox news except idiots.
<Glacymr> 12drf ;-;
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm actually very interested in a girl I know online.
<Glacymr> 12eXAKR knows my voice
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm just afraid to tell her I like her.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Especially since she's admitted that she's not into relationships.
<Nittany_Tiger_> But we are good friends.
<junh1024-XD> i smell skyping
<prince-dari> I didn't say I liked Fox news. :P
<Bjornfot> "Not into relationships?" lol
<prince-dari> I said I liked what they said.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I was having a wonderful correspondence with a nice young woman on Flankbook via messages...but then the damn site went down!
<Glacymr> 12i smell....
<Glacymr> 12nothing, i want food ;-;
<Nittany_Tiger_> I wasn't into relationships until I was 25.
<Bjornfot> Oh, does she mean she don't want to get all serious and tied up?
<Nittany_Tiger_> I was 100% school for a long, long time.
<Nittany_Tiger_> No. She's introverted like me.
<Bjornfot> If so, then you're DAMN lucky! Go get her, tiger!
<Nittany_Tiger_> Which I like introverts.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Be a gentleman!
<Nittany_Tiger_> I do. I be myself.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> :D
<Jaunty_Scribbles> that's always the best
<Nittany_Tiger_> I try to make her happy when she's down.
<Nittany_Tiger_> The only downside is that she can get confrontational.
<Bjornfot> ugh, women
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Women are women. That's what makes them so interesting
<Bjornfot> always something.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> And infuriating
<Nittany_Tiger_> Meh.
<Polarfire> I have no desire to pursue any relationship with anyone.
<Bjornfot> They're not interesting, they're annoying. Most of the time.
<Polarfire> I am the type of person who is happier by myself
<Bjornfot> actually, about 6.25% are pretty cool
<Nittany_Tiger_> I see myself as rare type of person who's more into having a relationship than sex, which I have zero interest in.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Not me, I'm a total Pinkie Pie sort of brony
<prince-dari> Relationships, I dunno, random fun at parties is a go though. :D
<Bjornfot> But most are just so... complicated... and stuff
<Nittany_Tiger_> I don't do social meetings.
<Bjornfot> Guys are much better. No complications.
<Dashite> Oh hey! Non-shaky cam! http://media.nick.com/mgid:cms:video:nick.com:933818
<Nittany_Tiger_> forever alone :<
<prince-dari> Why not Nittany?
<Nittany_Tiger_> Being introverted makes it hard to make friends.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm just not a social person.
<MidnightStar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RRCvzTubC8
<Bjornfot> join the dark side nittany, you'll increase your chances dramatically
<Dashite> Because living off campus my first year of university was a big mistake.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I try to be a times.
<prince-dari> I tend to be shy around people I don't know.
<prince-dari> Around my friends though? Nope.
<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Kl0Gr1VYQ
<Dashite> Know that feeling.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Naw, Tiger, that just means you're mature
<Jaunty_Scribbles> When you get past the hormones you realize how nice it is just to have someone who'll accept you for who you are and hold you at the end of the day and tell you they love you before you both just pass out....am I right?
<Dashite> Just kinda hard to figure out what to talk about with people you don't know. :/
<prince-dari> Oh, and not very far into a party shyness = gone anyway.
*Armads throws glacymr one cherrio
<Armads> *cheerio
<Glacymr> 12gee how nice
<Nittany_Tiger_> Maturity can suck, but thanks.
<Bjornfot> ^
<Nittany_Tiger_> In 6 months, I might be in an office job, which will suck because I can't be casual anymore.
<Armads> inorite
<Armads> I'm such a generous person
<Nittany_Tiger_> Nor possibly take 2-week trips to chase storms.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Unless I land a job in tornado alley.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I need to make money off of that if possible. Some people do by selling video and streaming live.
<Nittany_Tiger_> The people I chased with did live streaming.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50-oWY1pFE&feature=related
<Polarfire> I'm not very social irl
<Polarfire> but I can find something to talk about with pretty much anybody.
<Bjornfot> who needs to be social anyway?
<Bjornfot> there is internet
<Nittany_Tiger_> I could never get anyone in the Penn State meteo dept to go on a plains chase with me.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Human beings are by their nature social creatures
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yeah.
<Polarfire> I get bored quickly if I don't have someone or a small group to talk with.
<Nittany_Tiger_> That's why it gets boring quickly in my apt since I live alone.
<Polarfire> But I'm shy in big groups and don't like attention.
<Bjornfot> I get bored quickly if I don't have internet.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I though of having a roommate, but it may not work out.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Because I like privacy as well.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> That's why it's good to have an extraverted friend who'll help you fit in
<Nittany_Tiger_> I liked most of my roommates in college.
<Dashite> Sadly most of my friends are fairly introverted too...
<Armads> lol I just realized the instructions that came with my hard drive are in engrish
<drf|laptop> 03and, done with HP7.1
<Nittany_Tiger_> Well, I want to help the girl I like become less introverted.
<drf|laptop> 03now I get to wait til tomorrow to see part 2 XD
<Armads> FAQ3: "Drive does not be recognized in BIOS setup"
<Nittany_Tiger_> The thing is, some people like to push introverts into becoming extroverts. That's not how you do it.
<Armads> "Confirm whether BIOS setup became correctly"
<Polarfire> I like talking 1 on 1 with people. I want to know their beliefs, their customs, what problems they have right now and what's going good in their lief, etc.
<Nittany_Tiger_> They have to do it on their own.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnTPsNAutKY
<drf|laptop> 03anyway bbl on desktop
<Armads> "Even though the HDD recognized in BIOS setup, it does not be seen in Windows"
<Armads> there's gotta be an all your base in here somewhere.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Well, this girl and I kind-of shoot the breeze on IRC like that.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Though she can be quiet.
<prince-dari> I found that the best thing was just to be andnotasinglefuck.jpg about what people think of you.
<Bjornfot> ^
<Nittany_Tiger_> Sometimes hard.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Yes
<Jaunty_Scribbles> It is hard
<Jaunty_Scribbles> But that's what makes you cool...people KNOW how hard it is, and you get respect for that
<Polarfire> I don't care what people think about me.
<Polarfire> I wouldn't change a single thing about my looks, my life, etc.
<Polarfire> I'm not ashamed of being a brony either.
<Bjornfot> I have never given a fuckshitstack about what people think about me.
<Bakphoon> i like how a lot of things are in engrish nowadays
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Nittany_Tiger_> You're pretty cool people.
<Polarfire> I just don't announce it to the world like gay people announce their sexuality
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I'm not ashamed I'm totally in love with Fluttershy. Not a damn bit.
<prince-dari> Duh, we're all cool people. :P
<Nittany_Tiger_> I 90% DGAF about what others think of me.
<Polarfire> we're bronies
<Nittany_Tiger_> But I won't do nutty things in public.
<prince-dari> ^
<Nittany_Tiger_> Though I want to at times.
<Polarfire> we are cool
<Polarfire> we are the coolest of the cool
<Jaunty_Scribbles> We're bronies. We have CLASS.
<Polarfire> like that
<prince-dari> Bronies are so damn cool.
<Polarfire> and stuff
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yes.
<Dashite> Classy like Gummy
<Jaunty_Scribbles> :D
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Classy like Spike in a tux!
<Bjornfot> I was bullied throughout all of elementary school for having long hair. But I didn't give a single fuck.
<prince-dari> We're real men. ;)
<Polarfire> hell yeah!
<prince-dari> MFW most people in my school have long hair.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Dare I say even classy as STEVE MAGNET!?
<prince-dari> Myself included, though I really need to get it cut.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Ugh bullying.
<Dashite> @classmeter Dashite
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Dashite is 16% class. (523)
<Nittany_Tiger_> Those years sucked.
<Polarfire> I didn't have any friends for about the first 14 years of my life
<Dashite> Fuck you Steven_Magnet! I have more class than that!
<Nittany_Tiger_> I didn't have friends for most of my grade school years.
<Polarfire> but I learned not to care what other people think
<prince-dari> @classymeter Steven_Magnet
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven_Magnet is 19% classy. (524)
<Bjornfot> prince-dari: I have like, LONG long hair.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I rejected friendship in high school for a few years.
<prince-dari> Mine's not REALLY long.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> @classmeter Jaunty_Scribbles
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Jaunty_Scribbles is 35% class. (525)
<Nittany_Tiger_> Just hated everyone.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> WHOOHOO!
<prince-dari> But my fringe hair reaches my mouth.
<Polarfire> and now I have lots of friends
<Dashite> I had a shit load of friends until grade 3 when I moved and hated my new city. :/
<Polarfire> @classmeter Polarfire
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Polarfire is 58% class. (526)
<Nittany_Tiger_> When I got to college and people became mature, that changed.
<Bjornfot> but those at my current Gymnaiusm school don't bother me none
<Polarfire> oh yeah!!!
<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Kl0Gr1VYQ
<prince-dari> @classymeter Steven_Magnet
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven_Magnet is 16% classy. (527)
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I've always had friends...but that's because I've got a Pinkie Pie attitude and will make friends with just about anyone
<prince-dari> Wut
<prince-dari> @classymeter Gummy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Gummy is 89% classy. (528)
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Nittany_Tiger_> In college, there is no popularity contest. People get serious about education.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FGmgVu9Nz0&feature=related
<Dashite> Dari, Y U NO SHOW AVATAR? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVD_un7moAc
<Polarfire> all the deadbeats get weeded out
<Polarfire> in college
<Bjornfot> Also, no idiots get into college.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yep.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> lol
<Dashite> HAHAHA! People get serious about education...
<prince-dari> Dunno, I must have missed it Dashite.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm around the best people in my academic dept.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> There's a time and a place for everything, children, and it's called COLLEGE.
<Glacymr> 12hiii
<Nittany_Tiger_> I've never met a person I've hated in college.
<drfsupercenter> 03sup
<Nittany_Tiger_> Even people that used to bully me.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I would help them because they were having trouble with some subjects.
<Nittany_Tiger_> And we got along fine.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> There used to be a kid who bullied me in elementary school, all the time...now, I'm actually two feet taller than him.
<Dashite> Oddly enough, agreed with that. I've met a lot more people in college and can't think of any that I really didn't like.
<Glacymr> 12horrible
<Glacymr> 12downloading TF2 and trying to watch youtube at the sametime
<Polarfire> people used to cheat off me and I would let them...
<Dashite> Plenty of them in high school though. :/
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so Glacymr you have fillings, you might be able to help
<Nittany_Tiger_> Clemson and Penn State have friendly professors.
<Polarfire> but then I stopped.
<Dashite> Heh, I remember that happening in my programming classes.
<drfsupercenter> 03is it normal on a tooth with a filling in it, where if I touch that tooth it hurts a lot?
<Glacymr> 12maybe
<Jaunty_Scribbles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D93SvHXLWCs
<Nittany_Tiger_> Some are friends.
<Glacymr> 12usually fillings aren't supposed to hurt
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Glacymr> 12unless they are brand new
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder what it would be then
<Armads> I think that's normal for the first day or two.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Polarfire> hey dari, giggle at the ghosties 20% cooler remix?
<drfsupercenter> 03I've had it for a few weeks
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<Armads> else it might be a sign you need more than one lol
<Dashite> I ended up finished the 100+ little programs that we had to write about a month into the semester. I had people trying to steal my programs every time I got up from my computer.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's in the very very far back tooth that I can't really reach with a toothbrush
<prince-dari> I'm just playing the links in order.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Oh wow
<drfsupercenter> 03and it seems to only start hurting in the presence of sugar
<Glacymr> 12any tooth is reachable
<Polarfire> ok
<Glacymr> 12well drf
<drfsupercenter> 03DARN YOU FEATHER

<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Glacymr> 12and cold water hurts
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Oh wow, I went up 10 points!
<drfsupercenter> 03I just dunno if I should go back to the dentist

<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMizcECkwXs
<Nittany_Tiger_> Also, how I aced basic C.
<Glacymr> 12what is the harm in going to the dentist and just asking them to look at it
<Nittany_Tiger_> Since coding is just logic.
<Glacymr> 12to get their opinion
<drfsupercenter> 03it costs money
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ascendant> o-o
<Polarfire> I'm not logical at all
<Armads> and time lol
<Glacymr> 12they can't really charge you if they didn't do anything
<Polarfire> it bores me
<Glacymr> 12can they?
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'm a math and science person.
<Armads> they might, it is america.
<prince-dari> ^
*Armads shot
<drfsupercenter> 03I once had a doctor charge us $100 just for telling me my nails were too short, and that's why my fingers hurt
<Polarfire> I'll slave through something computer related because I like computers though
<prince-dari> I love coding, and everything about computers.
<prince-dari> I love maths and sciences.
<Dashite> If I could get myself to actually do my homework I'd be stronger in math than I am.
<Glacymr> 12heh
<Polarfire> I love computers and cars
<Nittany_Tiger_> I love the weather and astronomy. I love math.
<Bjornfot> word, dari
<Nittany_Tiger_> I aced everything up to discrete math, which I goofed off in.

<Armads> it amuses me that that quit message is still getting used.
<Glacymr> 12:)
<Nittany_Tiger_> Sadly.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uv6XLHJYL8 20% cooler remix
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<Polarfire> I'm ok at math
<drfsupercenter> 03don't feel like turning my speakers on
<drfsupercenter> 03sorry XD
<Polarfire> but it bores me
<Dashite> I aced everything up until high school when I goofed off.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I would love to show my discrete math teacher where I am now.
<Glacymr> 12then watch it in mute
<prince-dari> I love solving something really hard in maths.
<Polarfire> I aced everything in high school
<Nittany_Tiger_> I also like academia.
<Dashite> First year I ended up with high 50's to low 60's
<prince-dari> Gives me a great sense of gratification.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I hate math
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yeah.
<Bjornfot> math is almost as fun as programming
<Polarfire> I'm just boring like that I guess
<Nittany_Tiger_> I remember figuring out things on my own just for fun.
<Polarfire> ^
<Bjornfot> both are pure logic
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I love history, literature, and sociology
<Nittany_Tiger_> But unfortunately, I would find out that someone else did it before me.
<Polarfire> but mechanical stuff. not math.
<Bjornfot> also, finding out stuff someone already founf out ftw
<Polarfire> Scribbles: yes :)
<Nittany_Tiger_> Not really. I want to pioneer at least one idea.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Maybe within my current work with lightning.
<Jaunty_Scribbles> I'm not in college right now because I'm still in the Navy, but when I get out i want to major in Sociology and Anthropology
<Light_Latias> 12night all
<MidnightStar> The elder scrolls
<Polarfire> I understand mechanics and how things work, and that interests me
<Jaunty_Scribbles> Oh, and I love music!
<Polarfire> but not math :p
<Dashite> MFW the most interesting classes in Uni I've taken are HR related, for someone that doesn't deal with people much.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Even though I'm doing a statistical study, there's still a lot of fun in figuring out what the results mean.
<Bjornfot> ahaha dari, did you really stream that?
<prince-dari> Apparently so.
<Polarfire> I make the musics
<Bjornfot> That's me singing.
<prince-dari> Ahah, cool.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Did you see my first ever tornado?

<Nittany_Tiger_> It cost me a lot of money to go to Oklahoma to try and get it.
<Armads> o rly, tony
<Nittany_Tiger_> By the way, I'll never fly again. Too much hasle and hidden costs.
<prince-dari> MFW so bright outside.
<Nittany_Tiger_> *hastle (can't spell)

<Polarfire> I'm gonna go.
<Dashite> Later polarfire
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Polarfire> I know I'm a pussy.
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Cya.
<Bjornfot> SQUEEZE BACON
<Polarfire> bye everyone
<prince-dari> MFW we kicked your asses Bjornfot.
<Polarfire> bye bjornfot <3
<Dashite> MFW we asked for our indepenence nicely and got it.
<Glacymr> 12i have a problem
<Polarfire> ;)
<Glacymr> 12if from time to time i like to pour tabasco into a spoon and drink it
<Dashite> MFW I can't spell independance
<Dashite> And I still don't have it. :/
<Bjornfot> bye polar
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<Bjornfot> LOL!
<Polarfire> after this song...
<Bjornfot> >mfw by polar = bipolar
<Armads> that doesn't sound like a problem
<Armads> that sounds like a solution.
<Polarfire> lol
<Polarfire> and I'm not bipolar at all
<Bjornfot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT2FIL7Uv4M
<Polarfire> I'm pretty much 1-emotion
<Bjornfot> i'm pretty much 0-emotion
<Bjornfot> i hate emotional people
<Polarfire> yeah. I thought so.
<Bjornfot> emotion is mankinds greatest weakness
<Bjornfot> it often hinders us
<prince-dari> British army fights 3 big battles in a short space of time.
<Polarfire> yeah it does but there's a reason for it :P
<Bjornfot> socialism and communism are great examples of why we shouldn't let ourselves be controlled by emotions
<prince-dari> And only loses to the last army because of misfortune. :P
<Polarfire> how the fuck is communism emotional
<Bjornfot> HERP DERP EVEYONE EQUAL
<prince-dari> Noweigans got owned at Stamford bridge.
<Bjornfot> Logic>Emotions
<Glacymr> 12a solution to what then?
<Polarfire> that doesn't have anything to do with emotion.
<Glacymr> 12and yes drf
<Glacymr> 12i like spicy food that much
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<Glacymr> 12!alert 54650
<Bjornfot> yes
<Polarfire> And I'm not defending communism at all btw
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't like spicy food x.x

<ScriptBot> Severe Thunderstorm Watch till 2:00 AM CDT on July 24, 2011
<Armads> spicy food is awesome lol
<Bjornfot> Why are people communists?
<Polarfire> communism is a state of mind.
<Bjornfot> Not because of logic.
<Nittany_Tiger_> It's a good idea.
<Bjornfot> COmmunism is irrational and very bad logic.
<Glacymr> 12i agree
<Nittany_Tiger_> But it's flawed.
<Bjornfot> It's because of EMOTION!
<Nittany_Tiger_> Because it inhibits individuality.
<Armads> just the other day I had that spicy chili I always make.
<Nittany_Tiger_> And it's totalitarian.
<Bjornfot> Because DAWWWWWWWWWWW we must take care of everyone!!!!11
<Polarfire> It has been implimented in greatly impoverished countries as a means or human survival
<Armads> It was the first time my brother had some.
<Polarfire> unsuccessfully
<Bjornfot> everyone is equal hargblargl
<prince-dari> Neither just using logic, or just using emotion works in real life.
<Armads> He took maybe one bite and then went back to the kitchen to get milk.
<Armads> that made me happy.
<prince-dari> Also implying logic isn't affected by emotion.
<Bjornfot> Communism is does NOT have to be totalitarian.
<Polarfire> it is poor logic but I don't see emotion behind communism. Only bad judgement
<Bjornfot> it is dari
<Polarfire> true true dari
<Bjornfot> that's our weakness
<Bjornfot> that's what we must try to overcome
<Polarfire> now I gotta go guys quit bringing me back XD
<Bjornfot> to to break free form the bonds of emotion
<Polarfire> bye everyone
<Polarfire> see you tomorrow and monday
<Nittany_Tiger_> Meh.
<Bjornfot> to kick emotion in the face and embrace ture logic, when needed
<Bjornfot> like, in politics
<Nittany_Tiger_> Eeeeh.
<Polarfire> cool
<Nittany_Tiger_> I'd rather kick pleasure out the door.
<Armageddon> heya Caaz
<Nittany_Tiger_> For politics.
<Glacymr> 12http://www.accuweather.com/us/radar/sir/wi_/radar.asp?play=true
<Bjornfot> if one used pure logic one would quickly realize that socialism is completely irrational
<Glacymr> 12drf, tell these blasted storms to go away
<prince-dari> MFW no one system is perfect anyway.
<Bjornfot> that a free market and a free people is required for a true democracy
<Nittany_Tiger_> MFW I'm living under corrupt Democracy and rampant oligopolies.
<Caaz> Hiya.
<Dashite> Constitutional Monarchy!
<Bjornfot> The ideal system WOULD be anarchy. It would never work, though.
<Dashite> How would that be ideal?
<Bjornfot> total freedom
<Bjornfot> no opression
<Bjornfot> no corrupt fat men
<prince-dari> Because anarchy doesn't work is the whole reason we have governments. :P
<Armageddon> btw, Caaz, how do you create aliases in x-chat?
<Glacymr> 12Armads
<Glacymr> 12what do you put in that chili?
<Bjornfot> eeyup
<Armads> habaneros
<Armads> three of 'em.
<Glacymr> 12yeah
<Caaz> I'm not good with mslspeek, elaborate.
<Glacymr> 12you aren't playing around
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Bjornfot> i still believe that we should try to minimize those governments as much as possible, though
<Armads> :3
<Glacymr> 12i'd love to try it
<Armads> and it was delicious~
<Armageddon> commands other than the default
<Glacymr> 12too bad it probably will never happen
<Armads> well to me.
<Armads> lol
<Bjornfot> the less power for the gobernment, the more power for the people
<Glacymr> 12i honestly
<Glacymr> 12don't know where i can buy habaneros around here
<Caaz> Well you can do it the easy way, or the hard way
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Caaz> For simple things, say /rainbow

<Armageddon> can you explain both? :p
<Armads> I'm glad my local grocery carries 'em.
*Dashite has a shiver go down his spine
<Armageddon> haha nice
<Armads> granted though
<Armads> they don't always look the best
<Dashite> Fucking Rob Ford...
<Caaz> Which would be User commands, there's really no code on it, but it makes stuff easy, like /bot for me would make the bot speak, if I have access
<Armads> but when they look decent that's when I buy them lol
<Armageddon> Ah
<Caaz> Which would be somewhere in preferences I guess...
<Bjornfot> ...why am i ranting about politics, now again?
<prince-dari> Dunno. XD
<Dashite> Something about emotions?
<Aurora> well
<Aurora> that was a fun TF2 game
<Aurora> to all who were there
<Armageddon> well, how do you make them? :P
<Bjornfot> o rite, polarfire
<Armads> I totally wasn't
<NightSeas> 12It probably was :<
<Armads> :D
<Bjornfot> also, why are we watching whather stuff
<Caaz> Well you open up the User commands window, which is SOMEWHERE!
<Nittany_Tiger_> Right now, we need to get our crappy economy under control and stop greedy corporations from ruining the US.
<Glacymr> 12i wasn't
<NightSeas> 12Glad you had a fun time though :3
<Glacymr> 12i'm too busy downloading tf2 on another computer to play tf2
<Caaz> Somewhere in preferences, and you get a list, and a text box
<prince-dari> WUT
<prince-dari> SQUEEZE BACON?
<NightSeas> 12lol
<prince-dari> WUT
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<prince-dari> WUUT
<prince-dari> MELONS
<prince-dari> ICE CREAM
<prince-dari> CEREAL
<Glacymr> 12lol
<prince-dari> WUT
<Bjornfot> IT'S REAL, YOU CAN BUY IT
<prince-dari> WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
<Nittany_Tiger_> And stop corporate-backed bills like S.978 from even being conceived.
<Dashite> Squeeze bacon! It even makes real bacon better!
<Caaz> And then like, you click add, or whatever "+" button you see, and you type in the name, lets say "ram"
<Nittany_Tiger_> Push button. Receive bacon.
<SheenaFox> wait
<SheenaFox> what
<Caaz> So then you get a new command, /ram. You type stuff in the text box like...
<Dashite> I could really go for some bacon right now.
<Caaz> me rams the fuck out of &2.
<Caaz> me prances off.
<Caaz> And then you can...
*Caaz rams the fuck out of Bed.
*Caaz prances off.
<prince-dari> MFW mIRC is so much easier.
<NightSeas> 12My computer was borking to badly to play tonigh
<prince-dari> :P
<NightSeas> 12tonight*
<Caaz> User commands is simple stuff.
<Caaz> I can't see how it'd be hard, most of the trouble is finding it.
<prince-dari> What now?
<Typhlosion> Settings -> Advanced -> User Commands
<Caaz> Yeah I forget, mine is just on a list called settings so it's different for me
<Armageddon> Ah
<prince-dari> MFW we stream longer than BMN.
<Armads> I couldn't play because I was too busy not playing
<Armageddon> thanks
<Bjornfot> f yeah¨
<Caaz> The hard way would be to take up perl, tcl, python... and Csomething
<Armageddon> I know Python and C :p
<Bjornfot> what about we watch some cartoons?
<prince-dari> I don't watch any other than MLP. XD
<Bjornfot> like, ducktales?
<prince-dari> What do you have in mind?
<Caaz> Then you're a million steps ahead cause if you know them it's awesome
<Bjornfot> for nostalgia
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> then I need to figure how to incorporate it into x-chat
<MidnightStar> My internet is dying a slow and painful death right now
<Caaz> http://xchat.org/docs/xchatpython.html
<Caaz> Myster solved.
<bed> 03ew. x-chat.
<Bjornfot> adventure time is also awesome, for being so new
*bed runs
*bed nini
<Caaz> Why is the python one so much easier to read than the perl one
<Caaz> That's like, languagist.
<Glacymr> 12lol
*Glacymr gives Armads some ghost chilis
<Armads> :D
*Armads happily doesn't eat them
<Armads> even I'm not that crazy XD;
<Caaz> I don't know if the same is true for others but whenever I loop I die.
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12what are they?
<Glacymr> 12supposed to be like 100 times hotter than a habanero?
<Caaz> But once you figure out the whole Language -> XChat shit it's pretty cool.
<Armads> the hottest naturally-occurring peppers on the planet.

<Glacymr> 12i know
<Armads> I dunno the actual number
<prince-dari> MFW I'm going to get those and put them into food.
<Caaz> ...
<prince-dari> Then give it to my friends.
<prince-dari> :D
<Armads> but it's higher than I really want to bother with lol
<Caaz> That doesn't look like a thumbs up at all
<Caaz> That looks way worse.
<Caaz> SO DISREGARD THAT THUMBS UP.
<prince-dari> Although outside.
<Caaz> WHICH I ASSURE YOU IS A THUMBS UP.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Yeah.
<prince-dari> So they don't throw up in my house.
<Armads> rofl
<Glacymr> 12yeah and you can hide the body easier
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Armads> much as I love spicy food
<Armads> I draw a line between that tingly feeling you get when you eat something spicy
<Armads> and just dowsing oneself in pure capsaicin
<Glacymr> 12i....
<prince-dari> MFW this show.
<Armads> one of those is nice.
<Dashite> I have never seen this show before.
<prince-dari> The fuck?
<Glacymr> 12for some reason usually get the hiccups if i'm eating something too spicy
<sotha> This sounds frightening.
<Bjornfot> that prety much sums it up, yeah
<Armads> I just feel intense pain
<Armads> :(
<Glacymr> 12do you know capsaicin is used for pain relief?
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12as odd as that sounds
<Armads> that... sounds like a lie.
<Armads> XD
<Armageddon> heya PTS
<Bjornfot> YOU DING-DONG
<Glacymr> 12XD
<sotha> Get a life!
<Armageddon> and xchat actually is pretty good
<Glacymr> 12it's supposed to numb the receptors
<Glacymr> 12i guess after you died from the pain of ingesting it
<Armageddon> and python is easier than perl imo
<Armads> rofl
<Armads> I'm guessing after you're dead
<Armads> you'd be numb to a lot of things.
<Armads> isn't ice less you know
<Armads> lethal?
<Armads> :(
<sotha> This show is so smarmy. so saucy
<Caaz> They both seem similar to me, python looks like it can do more, or maybe it's just I suck at perl compared to what people have made
<Caaz> '
<sotha> Cross my heart, and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!
<Bjornfot> episode 5 is best. it has vikings
<Armageddon> I've never done perl :p
<sotha> His arms! They're all noodly!
<Armageddon> python is awesome
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> O_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________o
<Caaz> I toy with the python junk I find a bit, seems like a pretty cool guy. eh makes big scripts and doesn't afraid of anything
<Nittany_Tiger_> What are you looking at sotha?
<sotha> Adventure time?
<Bjornfot> dat face
<Nittany_Tiger_> I don't remember noodly-armed people in it.
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<sotha> um. . . that
<Glacymr> 12maybe
<Armads> my experience with capsaicin on the skin definitely wasn't numbing lol

*Espeon now belongs to Umbreon for 5 minutes
<Armads> I dunno about warm lol
<Armads> I'd describe it more as
<Armads> intense pain
<Bjornfot> FULL LIFE CONSEQUENCES
<Umbreon> 12i never thought it'd hurt to have it on the skin
<Umbreon> 12did you rub your eyes with it?
<sotha> Wait. Is the princess young Celestia?
<Armads> no, thankfully XD
<Umbreon> 12XD
<prince-dari> ...
<Armads> that woulda been even uglier.
*Nittany_Tiger_ is going to bed.
<prince-dari> This show...Is just...Strange...
<Umbreon> 12much much uglier
<Armads> but yeah, capsaicin does get absorbed into your skin
<Armads> it just doesn't happen right away
<Nittany_Tiger_> I don't remember any of that crap in Adventure Time.
<Armads> I think it took sixty to ninety minutes for me to feel it.
<Armads> maybe two hours.
<Armads> And then I wouldn't stop feeling it.
<Bjornfot> Strange?
<Armads> the burn lasted like three days. @_x
<Nittany_Tiger_> Unless you're referring to rainicorns.
<Bjornfot> You haven't seen strange until you see the boom boom mountain episode
<sotha> FOREVER
<Nittany_Tiger_> I've seen it.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I consider The Regular Show strange, not Adventure Time.
<sotha> This is seriously frightening me.
<Umbreon> 12oww
<prince-dari> ...
<Umbreon> 12you know some people actually get injeceted with capsaicin
<prince-dari> It's just strange.
<Umbreon> 12by needle for pain research
<Armads> XD
<Armads> I'd only do that if given ridiculous compensation.
<Umbreon> 12yeah XD
<Umbreon> 12same
<Armads> that stuff hurt like hell.
<Armads> I couldn't play minecraft all weekend D:
<Umbreon> 12then i'd ask if i can have some in a glass
<MidnightStar> oh my.
<Umbreon> 12make a horrible april fools joke
<Bjornfot> SXY-LMP
<Armads> I'm sure some dark corner of the internet sells pure capsaicin rofl
<Armads> Or you could just use pepper spray, that's pretty close.
<Bjornfot> dem adult jokes
<Umbreon> 12some guy in a dark ally
<Umbreon> 12beckoning people over
<Umbreon> 12"hey, you want the hot stuff?"
<Armads> selling capsaicin to unwitting customers and watching the ensuing pain
<Armads> that sounds like a heck of a business
<Armads> I should try it.
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't believe I'ms aying this but
<drfsupercenter> 03I need someone with an iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad to help me with something

<Manlyguy> Don't forget the Lucky Charms.
<junh1024-XD> k, tx
<Armads> I now have the weirdest feeling in the back of my throat.
<Armads> It's a bit tingly from the hot sauce
<Armads> but at the same time it feels like it's not there.
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> did you hear about the Norway gunman, Drake?
<Drake> 04no?
<Bjornfot> and a black dynomite PMV
<Armageddon> http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4099188,00.html
<prince-dari> 7 people died in Oslo
<Armageddon> http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/2011/07/24/norway-massacre-dark-secrets-of-man-who-killed-92-on-in-deadly-shooting-spree-86908-23293720/
<prince-dari> 80 on some youth island.
<Armads> also throwing this out there
<Armageddon> 92 died altogether apparently
<Armageddon> maybe even 98
<Armads> if I get super trippy from this
<Armads> and defenestrate myself or something equally crazy and end up dead
<Armads> no one here can have my stuff.
<Manlyguy> Can I at least keep your body?
<Armads> 'cept that
<Armads> you can have that if you want.
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04Whoa
<Manlyguy> I need a realistic decoration for next Halloween.
<Armads> ...that actually sounds like a pretty awesome way to be buried.
<Armads> Have my body shipped somewhere or disposed of
<Armads> and have a bunch of computers and crap buried instead of the body.
<Armads> And put up a gravestone for those.
<Manlyguy> lmfao
<Armads> I'm totally putting that on my will.
<NightSeas> 12Well, seeya everyone
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway off to bed
<Armads> lol
<Armads> later x2
<NightSeas> 12Yep xD
<PTS> 1 guy killed 92?
<Dakurai> Dx
<Dakurai> You talkin about norway?
<Dakurai> I hate hearin about that :'(
<Glacymr> 12http://www.smackjeeves.com/images/uploaded/comics/d/a/daf72c366PRx9.png
<prince-dari> How is it that I can watch someone count for an hour, but I doubt I'd be able to count for an hour myself.
<prince-dari> Woo!
<MidnightStar> he won
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<prince-dari> 13 hours?
<Armads> watching takes less effort maybe? lol
<prince-dari> Challenge accepted.
<Dashite> ...
<prince-dari> MFW viewers clearly hate me.
<prince-dari> Next video is 13 hours long.
<prince-dari> Yay.
<Armads> XD
<MidnightStar> OH GOD NUUUUUUUUUU
<prince-dari> Oh I should have known. BJORNFOT.
<prince-dari> Don't trust vikings.
<prince-dari> They are egg faces.
<Glacymr> 12i know prince-dari wants to do that one day
<prince-dari> Do what?
<Glacymr> 12eggface
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Yes.
<prince-dari> That would be awesome. XD
<Glacymr> 12it'd go on facebook
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: LONGEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!!! | by | Length: | Views: 1 521 621
<prince-dari> There can't be stuff happening for all 13 hours.
<Glacymr> 12it worries me there is no length listed
<prince-dari> And yet it seems to be headed that way.
<Drake> 04whew
<Drake> 04that was fun
<prince-dari> Blame Bjornfot for the request.
<prince-dari> :P
<Glacymr> 12needs to be a world record for watching that video and staying awake through it
<prince-dari> Meh, I'll just leave it running and come back later.
<prince-dari> See if anyone stays the whole way through. XD
<Manlyguy> Lol, Lyon. I didn't realize you left.
<Drake> 04LOL Really?
<Manlyguy> Yeah, I was all looking for you. . -.
<Manlyguy> I'm not a fan of packed rooms, lol.
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I prefer it
<Drake> 04More victims for my sniper XD
<Manlyguy> Never liked it in any FPS game, really. It gets too chaotic. I prefer medium-sized rooms, like around 12 people, not 24. xD
<Manlyguy> I kept shooting random arrows and kept getting kills like that, haha.
<Drake> 04haha
<Drake> 04Don't arrows kill in one hit?
<Manlyguy> No, but they deal a good amount of damage. Around 120, I think.
<Manlyguy> And when everyone's running around shooting each other, their health is already low, so it pretty much is a one-hit kill at that point. xD
<Drake> 04Well
<Drake> 04Fully-charged sniper bullets deal about 3/4 of their health
<Drake> 04Get a headshot and they're doomed.
<Manlyguy> Yeah, but that requires precision. I don't have that without a mouse, lol.
<PTS> Lol Norway
<Manlyguy> Aiming with analog sticks is hard.
<PTS> Rip people who died tho
<Manlyguy> It's also just fun to shoot random arrows and get kills. XD
<Dakurai> good thing its over
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Well
<Drake> 04I've gotten a few headshots
<Drake> 04They really aren't worth the hassle because enemies move around too much.
<Drake> 04Just hit them twice in the body - Heavies are prime targets if you catch them unaware
<Manlyguy> They're only meant to be pulled on other snipers or people standing still.
<Espeon> 06heavies I find easier to shoot twice in the face but that's just me :P
<Manlyguy> The scope in this game doesn't have much horizontal or vertical movement.
<Manlyguy> I just don't like how you have to stay zoomed to get a powerful shoot. I thought that was kinda dumb.
<Manlyguy> Give my my insta-kill headshots. xD
<Espeon> 06and motivate more people to try to run around and quickscope in a game it doesn't work in?
<Espeon> 06sounds like a plan :P
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I was playing CoD the other day with a friend.
<Manlyguy> So down.
<Drake> 04Sniping is so difficult in that game
<Espeon> 06LOL what
<Manlyguy> I'm guilty of doing that when I first tried TF2. XD
<Manlyguy> Try Unreal Tournament.
<Espeon> 06What CoD game is this?
<Manlyguy> Sniping's a female dog.
<Espeon> 06you're talking about @Drake.
<Drake> 04Black Ops
<Espeon> 06The sniping is fine if you play as a sniper "should", but the hit detection IS pretty terribad :P
<Drake> 04Exactly
<Drake> 04I also hate ACOG scopes. They don't even ZOOM
<Drake> 04But using the Crossbow is really fun
<Bjornfot> OH FUCK
<Manlyguy> Crossbows are always fun. lol
<Espeon> 06^
<Bjornfot> you didn't-
<Bjornfot> SHIT
<Espeon> 06crossbows and bows are always relevant
<Drake> 04*thunk* what was tha- *BOOM*
<Bjornfot> dari
<Manlyguy> HL2's crossbow. Man, best thing on the planet. XD
<Bjornfot> you troll
<Espeon> 06every time you made someone stick to the wall with that thing you could add one point to your win-counter
<Bjornfot> you're really going to be up 13 more hours ain't you
<Manlyguy> It's also fun bouncing the shots off the ground to send the enemies flying up.
<Manlyguy> And with those ragdoll effects. lol
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Drake> 04Havok engine + ingenuity = hilarity
<Bjornfot> how long can a youtube video be?
<Espeon> 06spazzy
<prince-dari> Dunno, I've seen a 24 hour one before.
<Bjornfot> i mean
<Manlyguy> I kinda wish TF2 didn't have gore.
<Bjornfot> there's a filesize limit
<Manlyguy> I need to see more bodies flying from explosions.
<Bjornfot> (hence why this video has so crappy quality)
<Drake> 04I wish the Soldier's rocket had a larger launch force
<prince-dari> I dunno, can't remember.
<Bjornfot> but what if you make a 1x1 big video
<Bjornfot> one black pixel
<prince-dari> The video size restriction is different for different people though.
<Bjornfot> that never changes
<PTS> Well it's 5am I better sleep
<PTS> xD
<Bjornfot> 2GB without Java
<Bjornfot> I dunno about Java though
<Drake> 04Also, the demoman's stickybomb launcher is a fantastic offensive weapon if you lack precision with the grnade launchetr
<Manlyguy> I bet there's a mod out there somewhere...
<Drake> 04grenade launcher*
<Bjornfot> ah, 20GB
<Manlyguy> Demoman is my lag character. Which pretty much makes it my most used. XD
<Bjornfot> ...who the f have patience to upload a 20GB video?
<Drake> 04lag character?
<prince-dari> Some people.
<prince-dari> XD
<Manlyguy> When a room's to laggy for me to hit anything, I switch to Demoman.
<Dashite> Crazy people
<Bjornfot> they must have monster connections
<Drake> 04ah
<prince-dari> Probably.
<Espeon> 06Manly
<Espeon> 06It's a simple variable in the console or cfg to disable gibs :>
<Bjornfot> i have about 4Mbps
<Bjornfot> shit sucks
<Manlyguy> So bodies can fly?
<Manlyguy> That got me excited.
<Bjornfot> ...wait, that's download
<Bjornfot> i must have less than one upload
<Dashite> Most likely.
<Bjornfot> ~0.75
<Bjornfot> >suddenly, cat
<Espeon> 06I think it's just
<Espeon> 06violence_hgibs 0
<Espeon> 06and voila bodies will stay intact
<Manlyguy> lolviolence
<Manlyguy> I'll try it out.
<Espeon> 06it's right from hl2, but there they had agibs too - for aliens :P
<Espeon> 06or put it to 2 to see people get gibbed by pistol shots
*Espeon des
<Espeon> 06dies*
<Bjornfot> ...what program lets me make videos with custom dimensions?
<Manlyguy> No, no. I get enough of that from UT3. XD
<Espeon> 06lol
<Manlyguy> I dislike gore in FPS games.
<Manlyguy> Unless it's a really, really, really satisfying kill.
<Drake> 04Halo has slight blood splatter
<Drake> 04CoD has nothing, I believe
<Drake> 04TF2...well...
<Manlyguy> TF2 is over the top, man.
<Espeon> 06WaW had it, and BO has it in single player (and zombies of course)
<Manlyguy> lmfao
<Espeon> 06yeah, TF2 they go pop like a balloon
<Drake> 04Well, that's what would happen if you got hit point-blank by a rocket launcher
<Espeon> 06there's a difference between dismemberment and literally popping like a balloon
<Espeon> 06But it fits, TF2 is all crazy and cartoony afterall
<prince-dari> I dunno.
<prince-dari> Sony Vegas?
<prince-dari> Adobe Premiere?
<Drake> 04I wonder who the most sane man in TF2 is.
<Drake> 04I'd say either the Spy or the Sniper
<Manlyguy> Probably Spy.
<Dashite> @useless_at_editing_assignments My project group
<Dashite> Damn
<Dashite> @useless_at_editing_assignmentsmeter My project group
<Steven_Magnet> 6 My project group is 59% useless_at_editing_assignments. (532)
<Dashite> There we go.
<Espeon> 06sniper doesn't seem sane at all, he seems like some kind of isolated, antisocial gunman or something. Spy seems.. like a better choice x3
<Dashite> I don't even want to look at this damn thing again...
<summerstorm> who is they i wonder
<Dashite> They who?
<summerstorm> he said if they were to attack us. i wonder who he is reffering to.
<Dashite> Oh, the video?
<summerstorm> eyup
<Drake> 04The sniper just came off as someone who is misunderstood (his parents lol) and just does what he does best
<summerstorm> ooooh ok hes talking about america. well thats nice
<Espeon> 06but still, treating that as just any other job is a little bit odd :P
<Espeon> 06But oh well
<Drake> 04I love that one quote though
<Drake> 04"I'm not a crazed gunman, I'm an assassin. Well the difference being one's a job and the others a mental sickness!"
<Espeon> 06yeah lol
<summerstorm> wow this guys a douche
<Mewball> Hello?
<summerstorm> ohai
<Mewball> What's goin on?
<Mewball> o.O is that the real Steven_Magnet..!?
<summerstorm> i dont know who steven magnet is lol
<Mewball> He's an extremely famous poster. he was also !!Spike
<summerstorm> orly? i didnt know that lol
<Mewball> I never got to know him before he left, but apparently he's a big deal. I doubt it though. He left.
<Mewball> that he's the real Steven anyway
<summerstorm> yeah lotsa fakers nowadays lol
<Mewball> *shrugs*
<summerstorm> so wahts up with you on this fine whatever it is where u are
<Dashite> I can tell you it's not the real Steven Magnet, nor is it trying to be.
<summerstorm> well there ya go
<Mewball> alright
<Manlyguy> Damn, it's late.
<Manlyguy> nuh
<Armads> actually it's pretty early
*Armads shot
<Bjornfot> damn
<Bjornfot> i need 115GB
<summerstorm> get a flash drive then
<Dashite> That's one big flash drive...
<Bjornfot> nvm i'll try vegas instead
<summerstorm> hmm touche. get an external hard drive then lo
<summerstorm> l

<Dakurai> Hmm
<Drake> 04homework's finished
<Armads> coolio
<Bjornfot> hmm
<Bjornfot> if a video has 2 million frames
<Bjornfot> and goes at 0,05fps
<Bjornfot> how long will it be?
<Armads> I believe I have finished chapter 0 of whatsit story
<Armads> whee for not sleeping~
<Bjornfot> ...about 11000 hours according to my calculations
<Bjornfot> shit
<Bjornfot> i'm totally going to break youtube...
<Ascendant> heh, Armads
<Ascendant> Read Reminiscence and lol at how long it is
*Ascendant hides
<Armads> rofl
<Armads> pretending I know what that is :(
<Ascendant> it's my fanfiction :p
<Armads> oh lol
<Ascendant> well, story
<Ascendant> not really "fan"fiction
<Armads> same here ish
<Ascendant> it's 23 chapters, but some chapters are 15000+ words
<Armads> rofl damn XD
<Armads> This chapter's only some 2300 words and that alone took me like a week to do lol
<Ascendant> yeah, but I take like months to update sometimes :x
<Ascendant> ask Drake about it
<Ascendant> or Xeli
<Armads> lol
<Armads> my story kinda isn't a fanfic either
<Drake> 042300
<Drake> 04lol
<Armads> but it's based on D&D so that might count
<Armads> lol
<Drake> 04I remember when I was proud for writing 2300 words in a chapter
<Ascendant> ^
<Armads> WELL SORRY I'M NOT A PRO NOVELIST :( :(
<Drake> 04Now I write at least 4000 words.
<Drake> 04LOL
<Drake> 04Pro novellist? In my dreams.
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> I write at least 5000
<Armads> maybe I should make that my goal for chapter 1 then.
<Armads> lol
<Drake> 04Nah
<Drake> 04Unless it's an extremely long prologue keep it brief.
<Espeon> 06and I really have to just try to get some sleep even though I won't be able to x.x
<Armads> mostly this chapter introduces the setting.
<Armads> even the main character doesn't show up until the last couple of paragraphs rofl
<Drake> 04Xeli
<Drake> 04Usually you're waking up at this time
<Drake> 04Heh
<Armads> rofl
<Drake> 04My first chapters mainly include HUGR background and plot information.
<Armads> sleep schedules are for wimps
<Drake> 04HUGE*
*Armads runs
<Drake> 04bad typo LOL
<Armads> http://pastebin.com/wr5e7sGn
<Armads> could someone read it and lemme know if it makes sense :(
<Armageddon> !weather Sydney, Australia
<Nightshadow|VNC> Sydney, New South Wales: Mostly Cloudy and 55°F(13°C)
<Drake> 04Ascendant, you're best with reviewing
<Drake> 04You do it
<Armads> lol
<Armads> gawd caffeine doesn't sit well with a gallon of water.
<Bjornfot> it's probably only going to be about 10MB though
<Armads> and lol I'm already seeing problems with my writing
<Armads> K SO I'M NOT DONE LOL
<junh1024-XD> the first paragraph
<junh1024-XD> sentances are a bit long
<Armads> fixing that too.
<Armads> I think I just in general have problems with putting conjunctions and semicolons everywhere lol
<Armads> I could probably arrange the whole chapter into one sentence.
<Ascendant> o_O?
<Ascendant> "It could easily have been starvation or thirst, but the arcanists of Skadi had suspicions of far more sinister forces at work in the desert."
<Ascendant> switch easily and have
<Armads> k
<Ascendant> "They told of the dust-colored sands themselves springing to life and rising to the heavens, swallowing the world around them into void."
<Ascendant> last bit there is dodgy
<Ascendant> just doesn't make any sense
<Ascendant> as in the "void" bit
<Armads> hm
<Ascendant> I'm figuring that you mean something like it's disappearing and such
<Ascendant> but people won't want to sit there for 10 seconds trying to figure out what you mean
<Armads> fair enough lol
<Ascendant> "Any sane man would have none the faintest idea what such bizarre tales could signify."
<Drake> 04'would not have' would sound better
<Ascendant> it's a phrase thingy or whatever those were called, sayings, whatever, but yeah
<Ascendant> what Drake said
<Armads> I think I'll just put "no sane man would have"
<Ascendant> "At least, it was sure to not be the [i]only[/i] force."
<Ascendant> reword that
<Ascendant> and I also swear you switch from past tense to present tense
<Ascendant> which is just about one of the worst things that can be done in a story
<Armads> lol :(
<Drake> 04I prefer to keep in present tense
<Drake> 04And don't worry Armads
<Ascendant> I prefer to stay in past
<Ascendant> and Drake you write in past tense
<Ascendant> lol
<Drake> 04This writing is like, 10x better than my first FF
<Drake> 04wait
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04past
*Drake headbashes
<Armads> rofl
<Drake> 04I'M NOT USED TO WRITING TERMINOLOGY OK?
<Ascendant> "When confronted by the city guard, one of them would simply answer that they were travelers or sightseers. "
<Ascendant> travellers
<Drake> 04I'd show you my first FF, but TST is down atm so I can't
<Ascendant> oh lol
<Ascendant> TMoaTB?
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Drake> 04I mean
<Drake> 04compare it to this short story I'm writing about Dyan and it seems like some 3rd grader wrote it
<Ascendant> "He spoke little of the reason to his servants and guardsmen, but ordered that any similar characters be denied entrance into Skadi."
<Ascendant> Armads, change guardsmen to guards
<Armads> oh lol
<Armads> I use 'guardsmen' all over the place :(
<Drake> 04I always have difficulty naming my towns and cities, so I resort to using Google Translate to get cool-sounding names.
<Armads> I kind of have a cheat sheet for naming places lol
<Drake> 04I mean
<Drake> 04'Sacer'
<Drake> 04Does that sound like a town to you? A major medieval city?
<Armads> sounds like a Latin verb
<Armads> infinitive
<Armads> or 'races' backwards
*Armads shot
<Armads> ...wait nvm, vowels are backwards
<Armads> lolol
<Drake> 04It's Latin for 'doomed' actually
<Armads> ah lol
<Drake> 04But then Google Translate isn't always accurate
<Armads> sounds like a very happy city.
<Drake> 04As you could tell, the town is 'doomed' XD
<Armads> "...the dust-colored sands themselves springing to life and rising to the heavens, and the whole world around them being swallowed into void."
<Drake> 04http://pastebin.com/7EZPSUKv
<Armads> does that one make more sense?
<Drake> 04'and the whole world around them being swallowed into a void' would sound better methinks
<Armads> maybe, I guess it does make more grammatical sense lol
<Bjornfot> @boredmeter Bjornfot
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Bjornfot is 65% bored. (533)
<Drake> 04I don't think anyone visited that link LOL
<Armads> Armads did :P
<Drake> 04orly?
<Armads> yarly
<Drake> 04And your thoughts? It's the start of a shoart story/backstory for one of my characters in an RP
<Armads> lol at the name Tellius.
<Drake> 04short*
<Drake> 04Hey, I know it's blatant copying but I didn't choose it
<Bjornfot>  ▲
<Bjornfot> ▲ ▲
<Armads> only problem I have with it is mentioning all those nations' names at once like that lol
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Everyone who will read it will understand them.
<Drake> 04But I might trim it down.
<Armads> yeah :(
<Armads> hearing all those names and not knowing their relationships with each other is kinda confusing
<Bjornfot> ■ ■
<Bjornfot> ■ ■
<Drake> 04It's just nations that border the other two
<Drake> 04some guys got pissed and are now stabbing each other
<Bjornfot> NEWFOALS CAN'T QUADFORCE
<Armads> lol
<Armads> ain't that always how war works
<Drake> 04I know
<Drake> 04But the reason behind the war isn't the main plot in the story
<Drake> 04It'
<Drake> 04It's more what the hell the character is doing there and what he does to screw with everyone.
<Bjornfot> @☺meter ◘
<Steven_Magnet> 6 ◘ is 73% ☺. (534)
<Drake> 04Because in all honesty, he doesn't belong on that world at all. He'd an in-universe foreign object.
<Armads> interesting.
<Ascendant> <Drake> 'and the whole world around them being swallowed into a void' would sound better methinks
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> bloody hivemind
<Drake> 04As always it's explained in the story (or is it?) and everything is wrapped up
<Drake> 04lol
<Drake> 04late much?
<Armads> lol
<Ascendant> and I know
<Ascendant> setting up a server :p
<Ascendant> and Armads
<Armads> yeh?
<Ascendant> you should read TCTL or Reminiscence :p
<Armageddon> o-o
<Armageddon> ohai
<Armads> guess so lol
<Armads> what's TCTL? Something else you wrote?
<Armageddon> Aizen :p
<Ascendant> To Cross The Line
<Drake> 04Reminiscence is better
<Drake> 04IMO
<Ascendant> ._.
<Ascendant> TCTL is better written
<Ascendant> the beginning of reminiscence...urgh
<Ascendant> and TCTL is better planned
<Armads> I'll read bits of both.
<Armads> And maybe some RA Salvatore because he's a certified badass.
<Drake> 04lol
<Ascendant> lmao
<Drake> 04Ok
<Drake> 04So
<Drake> 04I'm pissed
<Drake> 04For a week now I've been unable to log into my mac
<Armads> I've pissed about forty times in the past hour.
*Armads shot
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> it's a mac
<Armads> lolol
<Drake> 04IT HAS ALL MY TV SHOWS ON IT
<Drake> 04I REALLY NEED IT RIGHT NOW
<Ascendant> because you're so life-deprived, right
<Drake> 04of course
<Ascendant> :p
<Drake> 04Saw Bad Teacher today
<Drake> 04Extremely weird and I didn't like it
<Armads> aaand the sun is up

<Skylands> 10k
<Skylands> 10Otaku? :P
<Satotaku> it's my otaku name
<Bjornfot> it's a challenge¨
<Satotaku> Otaku (おたく / オタク?) is a Japanese term used to refer to people with obsessive interests, particularly anime, manga, or video games.
<Skylands> 10I know
<Bjornfot> ...dari has been very inactive though... i wonder if he took a nap?
<HyperMetalLugia> EW :<
<Satotaku> which i realize i meet all the requirements of and i'm now very proud to embrace that i'm an otaku
<prince-dari> Nah.
<prince-dari> I was watching F1.
<Satotaku> i used to refer to myself simply as a gamer but that never did feel quite right
<Bjornfot> when did you go up yesterday?
<prince-dari> When'd I start streaming?
<prince-dari> Is that what you're asking?
<Bjornfot> no, how long you've been awake
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> I was up at 2 pm.

<NightSeas> 12Hey Skylands
<eXAKR> I think Arti's doing something
<eXAKR> But yeah
<eXAKR> This is overdue
<Skylands> 10Hi GL
<Satotaku> I saw tvtropes go down for the first time ever a few nights ago
<Skylands> 10It's been down for about a week
<Satotaku> It really surprised me
<NightSeas> 12She’s been upgrading the site to SMF 2.0
<Satotaku> and ah
<Satotaku> isn't there already a beta for 3.0 though
<NightSeas> 12Not that I heard of
<Satotaku> a beta usually means a final release isn't far behind
<NightSeas> 12All I know is 2.0 just had its beta a few weeks ago
<Satotaku> hmm i see then 3.0 right away wouldn't make sense
<Satotaku> though tell that to google they've always got a chrome build in beta
<NightSeas> 12True
<Satotaku> firefox is getting pretty bad as well
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail :P
<Satotaku> Chrome will get up to 16 before the end of the year
<NightSeas> 12But yeah, it's going to be down for a long time I think before Arti can open the site again.
<NightSeas> 122.0 is a bit complicated :/
<Satotaku> Chrome 16 i mean*
<Satotaku> I bet
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Firefox is just copying off of Chrome now
<HyperMetalLugia> Not a surprise
<Satotaku> you mean with their aurora channel
<HyperMetalLugia> And GUI/Release cycles
<NightSeas> 12Anyways, bbl
<Satotaku> alright later night
<HyperMetalLugia> Seeyas
<Satotaku> damn firefox will hit 7 before year end
<Satotaku> these builds aren't anything too special either
<Satotaku> kinda lackluster if you ask me
<HyperMetalLugia> I think FF is lackluster in general now
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Satotaku> i was actually impressed by IE9
<Satotaku> key word being was
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here
<HyperMetalLugia> I use IE9 and Chrome
<HyperMetalLugia> Should check out IE10
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<Satotaku> that's only a platform preview
<Satotaku> part of being an Otaku is staying on top of tech news
<Barry> What is this video?
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Destructor236 and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Satotaku> so HML iOS 5 is pretty boring isn't it
<Destructor236> ohai prince-dari
<Satotaku> it's kinda a catch up release if you will
<Destructor236> No idea
<Satotaku> i'm sorry i won't bore you with tech talk
<eXAKR> They took so long to release Firefox 4
<eXAKR> And then, suddenly
<HyperMetalLugia> I dislike iOSwhatever :P
<eXAKR> Firefox 7
<Destructor236> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlGpiZ1Mcfw
<eXAKR> Soon
<HyperMetalLugia> Apple sucks
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<eXAKR> Firefox 100.
<HyperMetalLugia> Then
*eXAKR stuffs HyperMetalLugia into the engine compartment of a Freaky Old Bus
<HyperMetalLugia> EVEN MORE BUGS
<HyperMetalLugia> AND MEMORY EAKS
<HyperMetalLugia> *LEAKS

*Sneas now belongs to Skylands for 49 minutes
*Espeon now belongs to Skylands for 11 minutes
*Umbreon now belongs to Skylands for 19 minutes
<eXAKR> Then within four months we will have Firefox 100
<eXAKR> And in a year
<eXAKR> Firefox 365
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, at least Chrome has been using the same cycle for a while
<eXAKR> 3 years
<eXAKR> Firefox 1000
<Satotaku> i would rather them take longer between releases
<Satotaku> and bring bigger change to the table
<Satotaku> is that so much to ask for
<HyperMetalLugia> At least the stable versions of IE/Chrome are improvements from the previous versions xD
<Satotaku> i just want a kinect enabled IE 10
<HyperMetalLugia> Expect Windows 8 to do that
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Satotaku> yea i know
<HyperMetalLugia> WHich...is kinda bad
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't like Windows 8 so far
<eXAKR> I want Gmail with that motion thingy they showed on April's Fool this year
<Satotaku> apparently everything do able with touch on the new start screen can be done with Kinect
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, GUI based
<eXAKR> Apparently some Kinect hackers actually made it real
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, Kinect is a touch screen in the air
<eXAKR> Which was awesome
<eXAKR> Google should totally make it real
<Satotaku> did you not like the start screen ?
<eXAKR> And then anyone with Kinects will be able to use Gmail Motion
<HyperMetalLugia> I disliked the lack of a desktop from what I've seen
<HyperMetalLugia> Or the Metro interface
<Satotaku> ah
<eXAKR> Metro is visually pleasing
<eXAKR> The world should be moving to flat squares and icons now
<Satotaku> well Windows 8 looks to be a tablet styled OS for the pc
<HyperMetalLugia> So, not if you're not able to use it
<eXAKR> Much better than Aero or Aqua
<Satotaku> Windows 8 is windows phone 7 for pc
<HyperMetalLugia> I dislike tablets in general
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
*eXAKR smacks HyperMetalLugia with an iPad
<HyperMetalLugia> So that is why I like Aero/Aqua
<eXAKR> Ew
*HyperMetalLugia eats and breaks iFail
<eXAKR> They are so heavy
<Satotaku> my build doesn't have the new start screen
<eXAKR> and useless
<eXAKR> Visually
<Satotaku> it's 8 but not quite
<Satotaku> I have 7989
<HyperMetalLugia> I couldn't care less about Visuals :P
<eXAKR> I think computer user interfaces usually should not need to emulate something physical
<Satotaku> Windows 8 Build 7989
<HyperMetalLugia> As long as there aren't GIANT icons everywhere, I'm fine
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh nice
<HyperMetalLugia> Where did you get that from?
<eXAKR> Simple, unobstrusive and minimalist ideagram icons
<Satotaku> http://www.winrumors.com/windows-8-milestone-3-build-7989-leaks/
<Satotaku> i'll even show a screen shot of my screen to prove it hold on
<HyperMetalLugia> Are there any 32 bit versions ready? :P
<Staeld> lol32bit
<Staeld> only reason my os is 32bit is that the 64bit download link was broken that day.
<eXAKR> Who still uses 32-bit on modern systems?
<eXAKR> Everyone's on 64-bit nowadays.
<eXAKR> If their computer is new, it's 64-bit
<Satotaku> Windows 9 will be 64 bit only
<Satotaku> Windows 8 will be the final Microsoft OS with the 32 bit option
<eXAKR> Is that true?
<Satotaku> http://i866.photobucket.com/albums/ab228/Roxas2080/Win8proof.png
<Satotaku> so i'm guessing Windows 9 will also be the first 128 bit windows
<HyperMetalLugia> IF that is the case
<eXAKR> Nah, doubt so
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm going to stick to Windows 7
<HyperMetalLugia> FOREVER
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<eXAKR> I don't think 128-bit will emerge until 2020 at least
<Satotaku> so as you can see in the pic i really do have 8
<Satotaku> eXAKR which is when Windows 9 will probably come out
<eXAKR> ...
<Satotaku> think about an average windows lifespan
*eXAKR smacks Satotaku with a red Swingline stapler
<Staeld> lol128bit
<Destructor236> How long IS this vid?
<Satotaku> Windows 8 can easily last 9 years
<HyperMetalLugia> 128bit is never going to hapepn
<HyperMetalLugia> *happen
<eXAKR> Windows 8 in 2012
<Staeld> Satotaku: I'll be looking forward to see that happen.
<eXAKR> Windows 9 in 2015 I think
<eXAKR> Then Windows 10 in 2018
<eXAKR> Windows 11 in 2021
<Satotaku> Windows 9 is the final windows
<HyperMetalLugia> Lies
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<eXAKR> If they are gunning for three-year cycles this should be it
<Satotaku> next is Midori
<eXAKR> Windows 11 could be where 128-bit might arrive
<Satotaku> Midori is built to be the sucessor to the windows os series
<Staeld> I don't think I'd bother speculating about Windows
<Staeld> I honestly don't care until Win8 is -out-.
<Satotaku> considering 9 will be the final windows you're right
<Staeld> then I won't care until win9 is.
<Satotaku> i'm honestly surprised they didn't call Windows 8 Midori
<Staeld> Satotaku: I was more meaning.. 'Microsoft OSes in general'
<Staeld> no matter what you call them.
<Satotaku> it's different enough from Windows 7
<Satotaku> and Windows in general
<Satotaku> though worth noting
<Staeld> why do they need to make the OS so different every freaking time?
<Satotaku> Windows 8 is still a codename
<Satotaku> so Midori could still be the final name
<eXAKR> Midori is the codename
<eXAKR> I think the technology in Midori will emerge in 2015 or later
<eXAKR> Which is when Windows 9 and 10 could come in
<Satotaku> I really think "Windows 8" is Midori
<Satotaku> it doesn't have any more windows
<Satotaku> it's all tile based now
<Staeld> tiles?
<eXAKR> oo
<eXAKR> Midori is about the underlying technology
<eXAKR> not the visual UI
<Satotaku> http://news.softpedia.com/newsImage/Windows-Start-Screen-in-Widows-8-2.png/
<Satotaku> I know eXAKR
<Satotaku> I mean the tech behind "Windows 8"
<eXAKR> You could have Midori running on an OS with a UI that is identical to Windows 95. Or something.
<Satotaku> plus Midori is a nice refreshing change from Windows
<Satotaku> in name alone
<Satotaku> it's something different
<Satotaku> it's sounds like something mysterious
<Staeld> oh, those tiles.
<Satotaku> that's the whole OS Staeld
<Satotaku> i think the "Windows 8" i'm running is the compatibilty desktop that was shown
<Staeld> yup, guess so.
<Staeld> when you said tiles, you got me thinking about tiling window managers.
<Satotaku> i really like the new UI
<Satotaku> and the idea that it will run across phones,tablets and of course computers
<Link> o-o
<Satotaku> quick question though, does Microsoft get money from people that use bootcamp on their macs
<Skylands> 10o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Funny how it works
<Satotaku> so they still have to buy the install media ?
<Satotaku> bootcamp just allows it to be installed ?
<Skylands> 10!espeon !umbreon
*Espeon now belongs to Skylands for 6 minutes
*Umbreon now belongs to Skylands for 9 minutes
<HyperMetalLugia> Media based I think
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Staeld> yup.
<Satotaku> I hope there isn't a bootcamp for "Windows 8"
<Sneas> 03o.
<Sneas> 03:3
<Staeld> bootcamp is just the bootmanager and stuff.
<Skylands> 10:3
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Sneas> 03*
<HyperMetalLugia> In other words, it just partitions the drive ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Staeld> nah
<Satotaku> though it will be fun to see iPad 2 running "Windows 8"
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<HyperMetalLugia> Not worth it
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Satotaku> my bad iPad 4*
<Staeld> bootmanagers are essential to boot anything.
<Satotaku> by the time "8" hits iPad will be at 4 or 5
<Satotaku> 3 is supposed to be revealed in the fall
<HyperMetalLugia> Sadly, the iPad will be as worthless as before :p
<Satotaku> even powered by "8" ?
<HyperMetalLugia> Never will happen
<Satotaku> Actually i'm hoping for cheap "8" tablets
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm just hoping for cheap tablets in general ;)
<Satotaku> if Microsoft makes a cheap "8" tablet apple is screwed
<HyperMetalLugia> Or no tablets at all
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> Isn't apple screwed already?
<Satotaku> "8" can do everything you iPad idiots can do... plus oh right flash
<Satotaku> i don't mean you guys in general
<Satotaku> i meant as an example
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, eventually they well
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<HyperMetalLugia> iPad idiots are everywhere
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Satotaku> "8" will bring about cheap tablets i just know it
<HyperMetalLugia> Funny thing is, at least the Wii supported some type of flash
<Satotaku> maybe we'll get minority report style syncing between an "8" pc and an "8" tablet
<HyperMetalLugia> That'll be a great idea
<Satotaku> "8" is a unified OS
<HyperMetalLugia> Even better- Sync all the games and software between them
<Satotaku> which is really smart of Microsoft
<Satotaku> every game that runs on a pc will run on a tablet
<Satotaku> or your phone
<HyperMetalLugia> If there is enough space on the tablet that is :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Phone, I doubt it
<HyperMetalLugia> But maybe
<Satotaku> "8" phones will be alot more powerful than the phones of today
<HyperMetalLugia> Depends on how far everybody gets with the tec
<HyperMetalLugia> If 8 phones ever come out
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Satotaku> Microsoft has said everything an "8" pc can do all "8" devices can
<Satotaku> one os at last this is very good
<Satotaku> less compatibility barriers obviously
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder how well W8 will run old XP and 98/2000 based programs
<Satotaku> Compatibility desktop
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, but drivers
<HyperMetalLugia> Some drivers didn't work on 7, or software

<Satotaku> hmm that's a cool script

<Satotaku> so pretty much Windows 7 snap taken to the next level very nice
<Satotaku> touch slates xD
<HyperMetalLugia> We need 11in tabets for that :P
<Satotaku> so what do you think
<Satotaku> i have feeling they've only just scratched the surface
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll only use it if it was on a tablet though :P
<HyperMetalLugia> PCs, meh
<HyperMetalLugia> That'll be hard to do with a mouse
<Satotaku> they say it's very nice with a mouse
<Satotaku> and keyboard
<Satotaku> if you watched the vid
<HyperMetalLugia> I did
<HyperMetalLugia> But no audio :P
<Satotaku> plus kinect integration
<Satotaku> which they don't mention
<Satotaku> maybe in a future video
<Satotaku> i wonder how typing with kinect will work
<HyperMetalLugia> Poke the air
<Barry> no idea
<HyperMetalLugia> All you need is a No-Glasses 3D tv and a kinect
<HyperMetalLugia> Then profit :P
<Satotaku> type in the air ?
<Satotaku> as if each side of the keyboard were really there ?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Poke the air and that'll type
<Satotaku> could work
<Darky> 06back from dinner
<Satotaku> welcome back Darky
*SilverSonic awakens
<HyperMetalLugia> WB
<Satotaku> what's really exciting is you only pay for the parts of "8" you'll actually use
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HkKcFKzorQ
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: Kinect Treatment of Windows 7 | by evoluce1 | Length: | Views: 172 404
<HyperMetalLugia> Wait, what?
<Satotaku> you can buy "8" in pieces in theory
<Satotaku> it could be as cheap as $20 or the full $200-400 for all the features
<HyperMetalLugia> What happens if you are unable to pay?
<Satotaku> you probably just buy features as you go
<HyperMetalLugia> Or at least without access to internet to pay with them
<Satotaku> then i imagine there will be full retail releases
<Satotaku> with all the features already
<Satotaku> it's a great idea in theory
<Satotaku> because it can mean cheaper windows
<Satotaku> if you don't need fax and printer support why should you have to pay for it
<Satotaku> and you can always just add it later
<Satotaku> or networking if you only need wireless that's all you should pay for
<Satotaku> am i right ?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :P
<Satotaku> thanks to kinect security will be quite advanced now
<Satotaku> we can forgo the need for a password and instead be scanned and logged in
<Satotaku> now that's very cool
<Satotaku> very hard to hack a computer with that kind of system in place
<HyperMetalLugia> What happens when your kinect breaks?
<HyperMetalLugia> You have to use a password then
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Sato03)02WB* - <KuroLink> "I AM ERROR"
<Sato> damn connection
<Sato> well i would guess you would have to take good care of your kinect then

<Nittany_Tiger> [14:33:46]	Dashite	Weather report says 26C. Feels like 30 with the humidex. <- I've never heard of the humidex. I'm 100% sure it's the same thing as "heat index" in the US.
<Dashite> Yes
<Nittany_Tiger> Is "humidex" proprietary?
<Nittany_Tiger> Like AccuWeather has "Real Feel"
<Dashite> It's slightly different.
*junh1024-XD hides for Shiny-Growlithe
<Dashite> Wiki says that humidex uses dew point rather than relative humidity.
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh.
<Dashite> Not sure just what difference that makes though.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Must have gotten mixed in with the name changes
<Nittany_Tiger> Dunno. I'd have to know the formulas for heat index and humidex.
<Dashite> The formulas are on wiki.
<Destructor236> Hi everybrony.
<Nittany_Tiger> Both are quantifying a human sensation.
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<Destructor236> Is it me or everytime i log in today the same vid always plays?
<prince-dari> It's still the same video.

<Maxaminus> Hi guys what's going on in here?
<Nittany_Tiger> Stuff.
<Destructor236> After this thing is over,whe're gonna watch a few Atop the 4th Wall episodes.
<Maxaminus> What's that?
<Alix> the fuck is this
<Destructor236> @Maxaminus It's a comic review show,in which a Minnesotan called Lewis Lovhaug,a.k.a Linkara,reviews bad comics.
<drf-Droid> so, yay hour waits
<Destructor236> It's funny too.
<HyperMetalLugia> Woop
<Maxaminus> I'm down for that.
<drf-Droid> I got some cool pix though
<Destructor236> There's also a MLP:FiM reference in one of the episodes.
<drf-Droid> http://i.imgur.com/WO2Ye.jpg
<drf-Droid> they put all 4 houses + a generic Hogwarts one
<Destructor236> Also,there's a "Zombie goasts" joke in another episode.
<HyperMetalLugia> Awesome o.O
<drf-Droid> yeah, but darn glare
<HyperMetalLugia> Or just geeky
<drf-Droid> oh well x.x
<drf-Droid> I got like 4 pix of each
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12Kosoveon tail o3o
<Kosoveon> hiii
<Kosoveon> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Kosoveon for 6 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
<drf-Droid> Glacymr
<drf-Droid> why would you make that face
<drf-Droid> ;.;
<Glacymr> 12i'm only humoring him
<Glacymr> 12D:
<drf-Droid> so what LOL
<Glacymr> 12you make fun of apple all the time
<Glacymr> 12so why can't i make fun of that face
<Kosoveon> because making a face is the worse possible action any human could make ever in all of eternity :P
<drf-Droid> yes
<drf-Droid> it is
<Destructor236> And,when i said funny,i meant "I foung it funny but you might not".
<Destructor236> *found
<Kosoveon> anyways, how goes glacymr
<drf-Droid> you know what I hate? false advertising.
<drf-Droid> I'm at the IMAX, right
<drf-Droid> "Apply today's admission towards a membership"
<drf-Droid> small print
<drf-Droid> "excludes IMAX"
<drf-Droid> then why would they put those postefs here
<drf-Droid> *r
<drf-Droid> >_<
<Destructor236> GODDAMNIT prince-dari!When will this thing end?!
<Maxaminus> What is this? Is this some kind of satire?
<Destructor236> No clue.
<Maxaminus> This guy reminds me of salad fingers.
<Destructor236> I fought Salad Fingers was green.
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Glacymr> 12annoyed Kosoveon
<Maxaminus> He is. He's also a creepy, spastic man-child.
<Glacymr> 12i tried to wash the car floor mats
<Glacymr> 12and now they won't dry
<Kosoveon> did they get stained or something
<Glacymr> 12no
<Destructor236> Dunno about the spastic part,but yes he IS creepy.
<Glacymr> 12i'm trying to clean the car to get it looking like brand new
<Cat> damn you, internet!!
*Kosoveon tried putting his through the washing machine after conventional means of cleaning wouldn't work
<Glacymr> 12not letting any detail go amiss
<Kosoveon> ahh
<Glacymr> 12however i did recently track mud onto one of the mats
<NightSeas> 12They won't dry? lol
<Kosoveon> mud is next to coffee
<Glacymr> 12yeah
<Kosoveon> as to the list of things that are impossible to get off of mats
<Glacymr> 12in fact NightSeas
<Glacymr> 12they were still dripping water
<NightSeas> 12D:
<Kosoveon> microwave them :>
*Kosoveon shot
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12it probably isn't helping i have them all laid on top of eachother
<Glacymr> 12but you'd think the very top one should be drying
<Maxaminus> When you expell a black, gooey mass out of your body, then chuck it in a baby carriage and dash over to your neighbors house and start smearing it all over the windows in an attempt to clean them....
<Maxaminus> ..yeah..
<Nittany_Tiger> WTF?
<drf_Droid> fricking wi-fi.
<Glacymr> 12NightSeas what did you used to do to dry them?
<HyperMetalLugia> Laser sharks ate it
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Glacymr> 12i've thought about using a hair dryer
<Destructor236> Well,i never did watch Salad Fingers.
<Glacymr> 12but i'd probably need 1.21 JIGAWATTS to power it for that long
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolwut
<HyperMetalLugia> Back to the hairdresser?
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<NightSeas> 12I used to just let them sit out in the sun
<NightSeas> 12And lol, once I did use a hair dryer xD It does work a little bit.
<NightSeas> 12But really, nothing can stay wet forever
<Kosoveon> after over 3000 miles of driving over the last three weeks
<Creideiki> Today I saw the second most funny thing happen in a datacentre that is possible.
<Glacymr> 12Nick
<Glacymr> 12NightSeas
<Glacymr> 12the oceans have stayed wet for awhile
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Destructor236> I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with the turning fork does a raw-blink on Hara-kiri rock.
<Kosoveon> my car window is forever caked with mosquito guts
<Kosoveon> that are impossible to remove
<Kosoveon> .-.
<Destructor236> That was random,i know.
<NightSeas> 12Hey Armads xD
<Destructor236> BTW,that thing i said was from Metal Gear Solid 2.
<Kosoveon> long time no see armads
<Kosoveon> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to Kosoveon for 16 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then

<Destructor236> WHAT THE GODDAMN HELL IS THIS?
<Bjornfot> wow, is this shit still going?
<Destructor236> YOU!
<Destructor236> YOU DID THIS!
<Bjornfot> no
<Bjornfot> i just posted it as a joke
<Bjornfot> prince-dari said ok and started streaming it.
<Destructor236> Oh.
<Bjornfot> You should be glad I didn't pick the 24 hour long one.
<Destructor236> Damn.
<Bjornfot> i think that's teh limit
<Destructor236> But how long IS this shitty vid?
<Bjornfot> all videos over 24 hours I've uploaded have been failed
<Bjornfot> oh this one is just 13 hours
<Nick> btw does anyone have Solatorobo for their DS?
<Destructor236> So......it should be over soon!Right?
<Glacymr> 12NO
<Bjornfot> i think so
<Nick> k
<Destructor236> This does kinda look like the end of something.
<Bjornfot> after the saturday streaming
<Destructor236> ?
<Bjornfot> we watched quite a few random crap vids
<Destructor236> Oh.
<Destructor236> Like what?
<Bjornfot> and some adventure time
<Bjornfot> and then this
<Bjornfot> so i guess it started a few hours after the show ended
<Destructor236> FINNALLY!THE END!
<Bjornfot> Show started... 7GMT
<Kosoveon> why do you ask, nick
<Kosoveon> just out of curiosity
<Bjornfot> oh, looki
<Destructor236> .......AT4W is gonna play now!
<Destructor236> Because of me!
<Bjornfot> hey dari i think we're allowed to sleep now
<Glacymr> 12http://img2.smackjeeves.com/images/uploaded/comics/d/a/daf72c366PRx9.png
<Destructor236> prince-dari,are you gonna play the Atop the 4th Wall episodes now?
<Bjornfot> ...or should we re-watch this while waiting for pony marathon?
<Kosoveon> I know what the game is
<Destructor236> NONONONONONONONO
<Kosoveon> in fact I'm gonna pick it up when it gets released here in september
<Nick> cos I had a couple of mags gave it a good score, said it was a really diverse adventure/rpg game, I looked into it further and it averages a very respectable 80-90% score average and it just got my interest, I'm interested oin getting it
<Nick> wait its not out where you are Kosovo?
<Destructor236> NEVER!NEVER EVER REPLAY THAT VID!
<Kosoveon> California
<Nick> its not out in the states yet?
<Kosoveon> xseed announced it's bringing it here september 27
<Kosoveon> nope
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nope
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02States are late on everything :D
<Nittany_Tiger> Was dari streaming A Pig's Tale?
<Nick> o-o
<Kosoveon> europe got it just a few weeks ago right?
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not watching stream.
<Nick> well thats quite surprising, oh well just to let you know then it got good scores xD
<Nick> lemme find a review for yews
<Kosoveon> yep, I heard
<Destructor236> No.He was streaming a shitty 13-hour long vid that Bjornfot posted.
<Sneas> 03dfg
<Kosoveon> heard it has good characters and nice variety in quests
<Skylands> 10hijk
<Kosoveon> but is very easy
<Kosoveon> which I don't mind anyway
<Nittany_Tiger> 13-hour?
<Destructor236> eeyup
<Kosoveon> never played the prequel to it (Tail Concerto) though
<Bjornfot> http://myfacewhen.com/images/71.png
<Bjornfot> >mfw dari is napping
<Bjornfot> http://myfacewhen.com/images/71.png
<Nick> yeah ease and repitivity of combat were its drawbacks
<Destructor236> he IS?!!!!!
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Nittany_Tiger> It's all wrinkly and has a funny smile.
<Nick> but yeah there's a lot on offer like minigames that are totally different from the normal quest (there's actually a racing mode all on its own which has its own dedicated online play, a review said the race game could've been its own game)
<Nittany_Tiger> Bjornfot needs plastic surgery.
<Destructor236> It's trollface.
<Nittany_Tiger> No shit.
<Nick> http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/28447/reviews/solatorobo-red-the-hunter-review/
<Nittany_Tiger> I was being literal.
<Destructor236> Oh.
<Bjornfot> both dari an i should totally have gone to sleep even before that vid
<Bjornfot> now i've been up like...
<Kosoveon> gotta say, it's supremely polished
<Kosoveon> especially for a ds game
<Kosoveon> since it was in development for a long time
<Kosoveon> it's kind of a miracle it got made in the first place, let alone released outside of japan
<Destructor236> I'm gonna post another vid,this time a vid by Spoony.
<Destructor236> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fLP0F8N4fw&feature=channel_video_title
<Destructor236> Here it is.
<Bjornfot> fucking long
<Bjornfot> ~38 hours
<Nick> yeah I read about its background and being the spirtual sequel to tail concerto
<Bjornfot> http://myfacewhen.com/images/71.png
<Bjornfot> http://myfacewhen.com/images/71.png http://myfacewhen.com/images/71.png

<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Destructor236> Trollface pyramid?
<Nick> I remember seeing screens of tail concerto in gamepro magazine a decade ago, gamepro, one of the best videogame mags I ever read and for some reason I was able to get where I lived despite being a US mag
<Kosoveon> I basically saw the entire playthrough of that game on youtube because it's too rare to find and too expensive for me to just get off of ebay, especially since it's so short
<Kosoveon> but it's a good game from what I can tell, with an interesting (although basic) story
<Destructor236> Can you wake dari up?
<Kosoveon> anime scenes are nice too
<Kosoveon> and tbh solatrobo is the last new ds game that interests me
<Kosoveon> aside from MAYBE devil survivor 2
<Destructor236> Another vid by Spoony is in the line-up now.
<Destructor236> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NLAcEOzfzc&feature=relmfu
<Kosoveon> but all the high profile titles have moved on to the 3DS, so it's sadly time for the ds to pass
<Icydragon> God, he still comes here?
<Kosoveon> at least it can die gracefully with a few good games still under its sleeve after 7-8 years
*L[a]korv only has an original DS.
<Bjornfot> eeeeenope
*Nick salutes the DS
<Nick> without a doubt the best gaming moments have come from nintendo handhelds *hugs his 1989 Game Boy
<Kosoveon> that can't be more true
<Destructor236> lol
<Kosoveon> in almost every instance I've prefered the nintendo handheld in any given generation to the nintendo home console of the same generation
<Kosoveon> and the ds is a perfect example...my favorite gaming system hands down
<Nick> well in recent gens yeah, we had to last 3 gens of home consoles from nintendo before we finally got a new game boy console
<Kosoveon> true
<Kosoveon> forgot the game boy had a veeeery long run
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't really have a favourite console, but it is either DS(i), Wii or PS2 xD
<Nittany_Tiger> Nuke England. Wake up dari.
<L[a]korv> Gamecube <3
<Kosoveon> oh yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Gamecube FTW :D
<HyperMetalLugia> I have two...just for the heck of it
<HyperMetalLugia> (Old and new model)
<Kosoveon> the little cube that could
<Kosoveon> <3
<L[a]korv> you could literally put it on a rope behind your car, drive around
<L[a]korv> and play afterwards :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup
<HyperMetalLugia> The biggest and strongest console ever
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<L[a]korv> also
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<HyperMetalLugia> Not the bigget
<L[a]korv> who here tried Pokémon XD: GoD?
<HyperMetalLugia> *biggest xD
<Destructor236> WAKE THE HELL UP DARI!
*Shiny-Growlithe sits impatiently
<HyperMetalLugia> I have
<L[a]korv> I want to play it :<
<HyperMetalLugia> and Skylands has :P
<Kosoveon> I have
<HyperMetalLugia> It's a...decent gamr
<HyperMetalLugia> *game
<HyperMetalLugia> BORING at times z.z
<Kosoveon> one of the best games for the gamecube imo
<Kosoveon> and I own a TON of gamecube games
<Kosoveon> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> SA2B was one of my Fav
<HyperMetalLugia> And Wind Waker xD
<L[a]korv> I loved Colosseum or how the hell you spelt that
<Kosoveon> metroid prime, supers smash brothers melee, pikmin, paper mario 2
<L[a]korv> never got to try XD:GoD :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Paper Mario FTW
<Kosoveon> paper mario 3d FTW
<HyperMetalLugia> I loved that game
<HyperMetalLugia> It was my FIRST GC game
<L[a]korv> Paper Mario: TYD~
<HyperMetalLugia> Magnus Von Grapple xD
<Kosoveon> although paper mario 2 is truly better
<HyperMetalLugia> Or however
<Kosoveon> I still prefer the original
<Kosoveon> dunno why
<HyperMetalLugia> Paper Mario 1?
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Kosoveon> for the n64
<HyperMetalLugia> I liked the second
<HyperMetalLugia> Just because it is so...polished
<HyperMetalLugia> Compared to the first xD
<Bjornfot> inb4 excuses
<Kosoveon> the first is very polished too
<Destructor236> lol
<Kosoveon> or at least it seemed even more so since it came out at the end of the n64's life span
<Kosoveon> and the competition wasn't exactly great
<Kosoveon> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Sadly :P
<Destructor236> But seriously,someone wake him up.
<Kosoveon> is paper mario 3d a remake of the n64 game? or is it a new game entirely
<HyperMetalLugia> New
<HyperMetalLugia> Thank goodness
<Kosoveon> because last time I checked on gamestop's website it's just a remake
<Kosoveon> lemme check again
<Kosoveon> ...apparently not o.o
<Kosoveon> that's good
<Kosoveon> hopefully nintendo will get the remakes out of the way so they can focus on making new games and ips
<Destructor236> brb
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Majora's Mask remake >.>

<Glacymr> 12the sun has smiled down upon me finally
<Glacymr> 12literally there is sunny spots all over the place so i can just lay the mats out in the sun and hopefully they'll dry faster
<NightSeas> 12That's good, lol
<Glacymr> 12and i found a way to dry them up even faster
<Glacymr> 12i ran over them with a rug shampooer
<Glacymr> 12which was killing two birds with one stone
<NightSeas> 12Ah, that's a good idea
<Glacymr> 12sucked the water out (for some reason the water soaked into those mats is still dirty water even though i had it soaking in clean water for an hour)
<Glacymr> 12and will make it dry faster
<NightSeas> 12It's all sunny now here as well XD
