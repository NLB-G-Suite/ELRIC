<Bacon[Hazard]> funny how the 4th most high score is owned by a brony
<CrimsonPhoenix> Smile song 30% pitch lower is best

<Alister> ''All you have to is take a cup of flourto put yu to trough trances'' That's not flour Pinkie
<Chrysalis> oh NICE looks like a ponyfied ikaruga
<Lighty> 06tsk, why doesn't dad just have a NVIDEA card >.>
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Shamroc> cya..
<Lighty> 06Easier for installing and alot better
<ACS13123> this is...interesting for one
<ACS13123> and GREAT FOR ANOTHER
<NightSeas> 02EW compairing NVIDEA and ATi
<drfsupercenter> 03laptop cards tend to be a pain regardless who makes them :/
<Lighty> 06why that?
<drfsupercenter> 03because they're all customized by OEMs and crap
<NightSeas> 02omparing*
<Lighty> 06ikr?
<drfsupercenter> 03part of why I love my custom built laptop
<NightSeas> 02comparing*
<Vordox> Just need a graphic artist to fill up the graphic slots. =3
<drfsupercenter> 03I just get the NVIDIA drivers straight from nvidia.com
<drfsupercenter> 03no funny stuff needed
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's rare, 99% of the time it's not that easy :/
<Xanbreon> You can normally grab upstream drivers from nvidia or AMD, at least for newer cards
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<drfsupercenter> 03my sister's Dell has an AMD
<drfsupercenter> 03go to their site and it's like
*Alister is augmented
<drfsupercenter> 03"Sorry, go get them from the OEM"
<NightSeas> 02NVIDEA and ATi are both pretty much the same if you ask me
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Lighty> 06ATI RS690M, can find it? xD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's NVIDIA< first of all
<Alister> I asked for this song
<cowvarkian> lies
<drfsupercenter> 03Lighty, from the computer manufacturer
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Bacon[Hazard]> :3
<Xanbreon> Depends on the card as I said
<Lighty> 06i know
<NightSeas> 02that too
<Xanbreon> Go via the OEMs website
<Vordox> I hope Shizuka plays Super Ponybeat — Discord (EuroChaos Mix) [The Original!] next. Alister. =3
*Alister acitvates Typhoon sytem near cowvarkian
<Bacon[Hazard]> AWESOME!!!!
<xmasskills> yes god yesh
*cowvarkian eats typhoon
<Alister> dumbass
<Shizuka> 13will this do?
<drfsupercenter> 03and NightSeas, I used to be a huge NVIDIA fanboy because ATI used to suck... but in recent years they've picked it back up. You can compare specific models, both companies have good and bad cards
<thisguy> more <3
<Alister> the Tyhphhon system launches explosions around me
<drfsupercenter> 03Probably the most diplomatic thing you'll ever heard me say, eh?
*drfsupercenter runs
<Alister> Typhhon*

<drfsupercenter> 03but I want an actual tablet PC, not one of those iPad like crap
<cowvarkian> I really hope nothing is happening
<Aurora> 6it's awkward to draw on

<Alister> Dken2021 No stupid and Retarded
*Dken2021 shrugs
<cowvarkian> Alister, you seem to be highly negative
<Digitalis> to each their own?
<foxinator> Alister: but yet amazing
<Aurora> 6nah, tablet PCs are a staple in art
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm an engineer, not an artist
<Vordox> What you all think about the song? =3
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 <jun> orly
<Aurora> 6I shouldn't have gotten my tablet, but I didn't have the money for a Tablet PC
<ACS13123> Alister: and strangely effective
<foxinator> great

<Aurora> 6I'm saving up for one now
<xmasskills> this song= eargasm
<drfsupercenter> 03tablet as in Wacom tablet or as in iPad type thing
<Alister> cowvarkian : No I have opinions with wich you do not agree so you automatically assume I hate everything

<Aurora> 6wacom
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Vordox> AND BACK TO DISCORD!
<drfsupercenter> 03I've got an HP TouchPad which is essentially HP's version of the iPad
<cowvarkian> no, you just have alot of neggative opinoins Alister
<Aurora> 6I mean, there's nothing wrong with it, it's just awkward as hell
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly all it's good for is Angry Birds
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<cowvarkian> *spelling
<drfsupercenter> 03that and maybe Draw Something if I ever get Android fully working
<drfsupercenter> 03as LOL small phone screens
<Alister> cowvarkian : You can't have good without bad
<Aurora> 6honestly I'd love to get an Asus
<cowvarkian> How do you know
<Aurora> 6but I don't want to spend a bloody fortune
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03tablet PCs are a ripoff for what you get
<Aurora> 6plus, those aren't flip screens
<ACS13123> this game looks...AMAZING
<NightSeas> 02hey, Android games are awesome XD
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I got mine for $150
<Lighty> 06when i read this, i feel so damn spoiled lol
<drfsupercenter> 03on a firesale
<drfsupercenter> 03as that's actually a fair price for a 32GB
<Alister> cowvarkian : How do I know what ?
<Vordox> Thank you Shizuka. <3
<RankWinner> Yes you can, you can have good with neutral.
<xmasskills> ACS13123: it is pretty fun
<Aurora> 6spoiled?
<cowvarkian> How do you know that we cant have good without bad alister
<Lighty> 06"dad, which iPad should i get?" "oh, ill pick one, and pay the 3G Pre-Paid costs"
<foxinator> Alister: thats a wrong statement you cant have good without worse but yet worse can stil be amazing O.o
<Lighty> 06yea, kindof

<Vordox> D: Then why play it, Shizuka?
<drfsupercenter> 03more like
<RankWinner> Because people like it? :$
<drfsupercenter> 03"Which iPad should I Get?" "There's a choice?"
<cowvarkian> to please the crowd Vordox
*drfsupercenter hides
<Shizuka> 13makes for good tv
<Vordox> Play something else entertaining? I'm pretty sure people mostly enjoy the music rather then the game. =3
<Alister> RankWinner foxinator cowvarkian : There will always be someone who will corrupt the the creation or goal wich was pure
<drfsupercenter> 03or to quote Henry Ford, "any color, so long as it's black"
<Bacon[Hazard]> Wendy's is awesome :D
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<NightSeas> 02LOL
<Aurora> 6but why would you even get an iPad
<RankWinner> We had a goal...?
<Aurora> 6like, I hate sounding like drf, but it's a serious question.
<cowvarkian> Well, obviously. Im just saying, how do you know.
<xmasskills> Alister: true true
<Lighty> 06Handy as hell for me
<Aurora> 6how though
<drfsupercenter> 03it's what I call "blinded by the leet"
<NightSeas> 02Android or gtfo
<cowvarkian> Because, you dont know.
<cowvarkian> Nobody knows anything
<Lighty> 06GL
<drfsupercenter> 03granted I'm guilty of that sometimes XD
<Lighty> 06dont get me started on that hypercritism :P
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah NightSeas, my tablet has HP's WebOS but you can install Android on it... it's just a bit buggy
<Aurora> 6I only agree on the hatred of apple because I know firsthand what it's like to have to pay fortunes and then fortunes more
<Aurora> 6for something I coulda gotten way cheaper
<drfsupercenter> 03like the wi-fi randomly doesn't work
<Alister> An Audiosurf where you ACTUALLY play the notes ? BLASPHEMY !
<Espeon> but hypocrisy seems to be so popular nowadays!
<Aurora> 6several times over
<Lighty> 06jailbreak and CustomOS much?
<pyrocatboy> Holy shit the weather changed fast!
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's to be expected of a third-party build :/
<Lighty> 06ikr Espy?
<cowvarkian> I want Audioserf
<drfsupercenter> 03pssh, with my tablet it's not even jailbreak
<Alister> nvm it started to suck again
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just "put the tablet in developer mode, done"
<Digitalis> :|
<Lighty> 06psssh, i dont give a shizz
<NightSeas> 02XD

<NightSeas> 02I don't know if you can find ones with windows xp now days XD
<cowvarkian> you would be resolved, and wouldnt become a ghost
<Vordox> WoodKid Iron Sounds AWESOME to do AudioSurf on? :D
<ACS13123> imma go play TF2 to this
<Aurora> 6but I used it
<Fattonie> back to the vacuum with you
<drfsupercenter> 03of course not, but that's why you use eBay
<Aurora> 6eBay
<NightSeas> 02unless it's used
<Uakh> who's broadcasting ?
<xmasskills> cowvarkian: it does in your IMAGINATION where anything is possible
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Aurora> 6yeah I'm probably gonna get it used
<cowvarkian> bah
<cowvarkian> humbug
<xmasskills> Vordox i play it on audiosurf every now and then
<Invi> lol
<Chrysalis> Moo
<Vordox> It's an awesome song, and might be good for this, Don't you agree Shizuka? :D
<Uakh> ninja and clean finish
<dedxmasskills> pretty cool
<Shizuka> 13that was of course the song for my outro vid
<Aurora> 6I just don't remember what model my friend has aervfgjhbkjyfxtdgf
<ACS13123> freeze?
<drfsupercenter> 03brb shower
<Vordox> Oh, what do you have in mind then now, Shizu? =3
<Vordox> Shizuka....Epic Sax Guy 10 hours? ;D Or Wo
<cowvarkian> yes
<ACS13123> can we has more pony music later?
<Vordox> Hmm, Jap or Korean...?
<cowvarkian> korean
<NightSeas> 02http://www.amazon.com/TOSHIBA-PORTEGE-CENTRINO-1-86GHZ-WINDOWS/dp/B003M73Y3S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336070109&sr=8-1
<Uakh> wub wub wub wub wub wub
<dedxmasskills> Vordox: the song can only be so long
<NightSeas> 02how's that?
<Vordox> Hehe, don't ruin the fun, dedxmasskills =3
<cowvarkian> so, its probably japanese
<Aurora> 6oh you know what
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So, is this game about riding on soundwaves?
<Aurora> 6I was about to say his might be a toshiba
<Aurora> 6and that looks like it haha
<Invi> yes
<Shamroc> moo
<NightSeas> 02XD
<NightSeas> 02it's 1-86GHZ which is really powerful for a tablet
<dedxmasskills> Scoot-Scootaloo: no its about getting the high scores while listening to kick ass music
<cowvarkian> fuck yeah
<Invi> Scoot-Scootaloo it generates a road by analyzing the track and you ride on it and collect points
*alexxm throws triple h into the chat
<Vordox> No idea Scoot, I'm just listening to the music rather then the gameplay. I don't see the fun of "seeing" it since it's very very hard to view.
<cowvarkian> it is Vordox ?
<NightSeas> 02I just wish there were more specs
<Vordox> It's just...riding the song...That's it? D:
<cowvarkian> how is that hard to view though
<cowvarkian> sounds easy to me
<Aurora> 6thats called google
<Vordox> It's like watching Nascar = Round and round and round.
<Aurora> 6like i'm doing
<Invi> Vordox and collecting ponits. yes ^^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03This music... its so... mesmorizing...
<Vordox> Indeed Scoot.
<cowvarkian> I think there should be nascar to the death matches
<Vordox> Well points or not, remove those and what do you have? Avoiding obstacles? :P
<dedxmasskills> Vordox yea i guess it can be like that but its pretty fun too
<Invi> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey guys, in Ticket Master at the end, how come all the tickets are levitating above everypony?
<Vordox> You ride alongside a Rhytm based track, avoid Grey and Crash Red. That's it.
<dedxmasskills> FAIled
<cowvarkian> instead of just driving around in circles, they could shoot out eatchothers tires and try to kill the opponents...
<Invi> so close
<NightSeas> 02so it has a stylus
<cowvarkian> but thats for the future
<cowvarkian> in a dystopia
<cowvarkian> and whatnot
<dedxmasskills> Vordox: not true there are more game modes than just this
<Vordox> But WHY is it fun watching it?
<alexxm> like what dedxmasskills
<CrimsonPhoenix> like eraser, pusher, dual
<cowvarkian> its subjective Vordox, so stfu
<Vordox> How is it Subjective with a question of "WHY" an individual watches it?
<alexxm> thanks CrimsonPhoenix what do you do in those ones
<dedxmasskills> alexxm what phoenix said
<NightSeas> 02those are
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pusher you can grab color base and place them acordingly
<NightSeas> 02really cheap on ebay
<cowvarkian> everyone has their own reasons why they do things. subjective. I win. there vordox
<CrimsonPhoenix> Eraser you can erase all of one color
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Shizuka> 13that fail is what happens when i'm showing off and glance at chat
<CrimsonPhoenix> dual is coop
<Shizuka> 13also freeze is when i focus chat
<cowvarkian> or co-op
<alexxm> thanks CrimsonPhoenix
<FleetFox> I'm gonna go play some Happy Wheel
<FleetFox> s
<dedxmasskills> Shizuka: ok sure blame us for your own short commings
<cowvarkian> >_>
<Shamroc> have fun!
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's a few more modes btw
<Shizuka> 13hey you've seen me show off~
<alexxm> what do the differant characters do

<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<cowvarkian> dont know why, just feels like it could be >_>

<Cobellanez> His computer was the only way I had of contacting him, but he didn't take it with him.
<twilight_sprinkle> Cobellanez: go to texas and find him! itll be a fascinating story about two people, a game, and a missing password
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd buy a 3DS XL.

<Lighty> 06Hyper
<Kipkat07_Mare> hellos
<Calcos323> Why aren't you playing on elite?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> that means ur number 1?!
<Viri> 14EC?
<Lighty> 06i almost reached 10.000 games
<Lighty> 0610K games
<Shizuka> 13elite takes waaay more reflexes
<Calcos323> So?
<Shizuka> 13i like to be able to relax
<Espeon> quality over quantity
<Calcos323> OK
<Clover> you did it again ghostxmas
<Espeon> and I can only assume EC is like
<HyperMetalLugia> exactly
<Espeon> rated e for everyone or something
<Espeon> or early childhood silly me
<Espeon> it should be obvious
<Calcos323> I enjoy the challenge of Elite
<Lighty> 06im not a newb at all, but Experienced and more pure thinking then you
<Viri> 14what's EC o.O
<Espeon> never even seen that rating used
<ghostxmas> did what Clover
<NightSeas> 02early childhood
<Aurora> *than
<HyperMetalLugia> 10,000 cheap/app games, or lame sequel shooters
<HyperMetalLugia> or something
<Alcoholic_Tempest> yum yum, rum rum...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ded chat is dead
<HyperMetalLugia> I've seen it
<HyperMetalLugia> EC is 6+
<HatsuneMikuFan> Can't decide between Battlefield 3 or SSX
<Shamroc> ...yep
<Lighty> 06nope
<HyperMetalLugia> or something
<Viri> 14what's EC o.O
<Kipkat07_Mare> Battlefield
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SSX
<Cobellanez> Battlefield
<Espeon> it's like an age rating. "Early childhood"
<Calcos323> SSX
<NightSeas> 02EC is 3+
<Clover> instead of talking you say you did something
<Lighty> 06Consoles from original to Emulators, PC Games to the max, and more and more :P
<NightSeas> 02not 6+
<WindWhistler> YO 'SUP
<HyperMetalLugia> Same difference
<Viri> 14ohh
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ohai WindWhistler
<Espeon> and dismissing games just because of their rating makes me want to go find the I PLAY HARDCORE MATURE GAMES FOR MATURE GAMERS LIKE ME image macro
<Alcoholic_Tempest> how about you choice neither and get a game that doesnt suck?
<ghostxmas> Clover oh you mean when i do the italics
<Clover> yes
<HatsuneMikuFan> I don't know. I want to play battlefiled because it has been awhile but SSX has a new DLC
<HyperMetalLugia> Lighty plays a ton of mature games too ;>
*ghostxmas laughs at Clover
<Calcos323> SUP WindWhistler
<Viri> 14I don't really follow ESRB/PEGI ratings
<Viri> 14they are a joke
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Viri> 14Syphon Filter was rated E in America
<Clover> im sorry but i talk on other chat sites
<Viri> 1418+ in Italy
<Viri> 14wut
<NightSeas> 02Espeon, EC is only used for learn to read games and such
<Kipkat07_Mare> Alcoholic_Tempest: You had WAY to much to drink if you think Battlefield 3 sucks.
<HyperMetalLugia> Some games dont' deserve to be T
<Shamroc> 0h god its colgate related
<HyperMetalLugia> (Knocking down ratings that is)
<Lighty> 06the netherlands did this:
<Aurora> 6http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-how-to-hatch-an-egg.jpg
<NightSeas> 02hence my joke
<HyperMetalLugia> Same with movies
<Espeon> they're recommendations not like
<Shamroc> everyone KEEP THAT A SECRET FROM FLARECHASER
<Espeon> limits/rules
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *cough*Emulators > everything *cough*
<Espeon> anyway
<Alcoholic_Tempest> Kipkat07_Mare: not at all, the game is horrendous... it should be dumbed down for people that only want to play casually
<Lighty> 06"oh, a game Advises 16+, EVERYONE WHO IS NOT SIXTEEN CANT BUY IT"
<Viri> 14Espeon, I can understand a difference like 2-3 years
<HatsuneMikuFan> Alcohp;ic_Tempest: You can diss on battlefeild all you want but SSX does not suck
<Clover> yes i agree
<Viri> 14but from E to 18? o.O
<Viri> 14what kind of recommendation is that? xDD
<Espeon> i mean every game that involves gambling is basically rated 18+ by default
<Bronysith> Shamroc: wat that colgate is cheating on him
<Alcoholic_Tempest> SSX is a snowboarding game right?
<Espeon> even if it's just virtual dosh in a poker game
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I dont like Battlefield 3. I loved all the previous Battlefields
<HatsuneMikuFan> yeah
<Clover> both suck get skyrim
<Espeon> mfw I have no face
<Kipkat07_Mare> Alcoholic_Tempest: lol I dont really care about battlefield. I just say that because I love the jets and the maps
<Bronysith> Clover: skyrim is lame compared to fallout
<Teh> *gasp*
<Kipkat07_Mare> Bronysith: Fallout is best game
<Espeon> and the lazy solution nowadays seems to be
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol They are pretty much the same in my book
<Espeon> "oh it's an action game and it's online? 18+!"
<Clover> i agree fallout has a much better story a backround
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ITC: Opinions stated as fact.
<NightSeas> 02Also, oblivion is rated M and was previously rated T. Why? Because some hacker figured out how to make everyone topless >.>
<Espeon> or "Experience might change during online play!!"
<Alcoholic_Tempest> skyrim is pretty boring after the first playthrough... it got boring really fast
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I mean what is really the difference besides setting weapons and story?
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6that one always made me laugh
<Espeon> lmao that's p. dumb
<HatsuneMikuFan> dragons
<HatsuneMikuFan> lol
<NightSeas> 02yeah
<RX-78-SweetieBot> magic
<RainbowcrashNBurn> fallout has a radiation level
<Clover> it gets too easy too fast in skyrim but its good when it lasts
<Espeon> reminds me of the sa "hot coffee" thing just not as stupid and overblown in the gaming media
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Indeed
<Alcoholic_Tempest> fallout actually gives you a different story to follow if you go good/evil/neutral... skyrim doesnt
<Ray> 02^
<Ray> 02Lol.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Now you know what I hate in Skyrim? Ward spells....
<LordCelestia> 0,5Vin Deisel once made a go kart that ran off of the hopes and dreams of orphans
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lolLC
<Alcoholic_Tempest> bacon lord!
<LordCelestia> 0,5It goes fast.
*Kipkat07_Mare takes a C-130 to New Vegas and lands at Nellis Air Force Base
<Clover> fallout has a more dark feel to it
<RX-78-SweetieBot> if the crafting and enchantment system werent so overpowered skyrim would be much harder
<YoungDamos> Hey Everyone.
<Kipkat07_Mare> LordCelestia: I c wut u did ther
<Lighty> 06hey Damos
<Viri> 14I don't really care about how much a game can be violent/non violent though
<Espeon> ~
<Viri> 14hi Damos
<Lighty> 06me neither
<Lighty> 06even though im not 18
<Viri> 14except Madworld. That was a very fun experiment xDD
<Lighty> 06i PLAY all the games i can get
<Ray> 02<Viri> 14I don't really care about how much a game can be violent/non violent though <-
<Espeon> if a game is violent just to be violent / using violence and HARDCOREZZZ as a selling point whoever
<OmegaMetroidBrony> How I love Friday nights
<NightSeas> 02In most games the clothing isn’t part of the models. So that’s no reason to give it that rating |D
<Ray> 02I just care if it is a good game lol
<Espeon> designed it should have their license to make games revoked
<Espeon> or their fingers removed
<Espeon> :J
<Viri> 14"oh, a very violent game? Let's try it. It's on the Wii, so it shouldn't be that violent"
<Clover> i liked fallout before it came to the hands of bethesda
<Alcoholic_Tempest> friday nights are boring... like all my nights...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Prolly the only thing that pulls me through the week
<Viri> 14after 5 minutes Iwas like "WTF IS THIS EVEN LEGAL"
<Viri> 14xDDD
<Ray> 02Which game Viri?
<Ray> 02xD
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 madworld wii
<Espeon> and changing rating due to something modders do
<Alcoholic_Tempest> i would like to see another fallout in the style of the first 2...
<Espeon> makes every single game ever 18+
<Ray> 02CaLLing?
<Clover> thats what im saying
<NightSeas> 02well, the person had to hack it to even do that
<Kipkat07_Mare> Saturday at 13:00 EST is the only thing that gets me through the week
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Being a consolefag I've never played the first two
<Alcoholic_Tempest> it wont happen though... no one seems to like top down tactical games much anymore...
<That_Irish_Guy> Hi all :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Though I do hear FO2 is badass
<Cobellanez> Hey That_Irish_Guy
<Clover> know its just a rip off of the elder scrolls
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai That_Irish_Guy
<Espeon> "oh no they model their characters naked so clothes aren't PAINTED on and someone removes them in ways that can't be done through normal gameplay"
<Viri> 14I'd rather to have all games rated 18+ instead of having them all censored though :/
<Elephant> :U
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi That_Irish_Guy
<Espeon> lmao censored gaems
<Clover> yes the irish are taking over
<Viri> 14Soul Silver and Heart Gold, for example
<NightSeas> 0218+ rating!!! >:@@@@@
<That_Irish_Guy> :$
<Alcoholic_Tempest> fallout 2 is awesome, and NV is almost as good... almost, but not quite
<NightSeas> 02says ESRB
*NightSeas runs
<Viri> 14sometimes 18+ isn't even enough
<HyperMetalLugia> censored?
<Clover> nv is too easy
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<Viri> 14Dementium was censored in europe
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Still it all comes down to one thing... does it kill time fast enough?
<Viri> 14why? Because it was on DS
<Viri> 14<w<
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://i.imgur.com/5a2Wj.jpg
<ghostxmas> hi That_Irish_Guy yea it rymes big whoop wanna fight about it
<Clover> fallout 2 is epic though

<Shamroc> RX-78-SweetieBot: related post with something posted yesterday
<CCCP> hello cowvarkian
<OmegaMetroidBrony> HatsuneMikuFan: /)
<CCCP> hey Teh
<Espeon> And that's not trolling, you'd be thrown out of troll school and mocked by all the other crappy trolls for that kind of "troll"
<NightSeas> 02a lot of PC games have ratings
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi CCCP
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Wut?
<HyperMetalLugia> one of the opinions was spelt wrong
<Alcoholic_Tempest> NV is easy, yes... but i was so happy when they added the Hardcore mode... that made the game worthy in my eyes
<Shamroc> even though you can cosplay...doesnt mean you should
<Viri> 14I'd just build a gaming PC if consoles weren't so longer-living than PC's graphics cards
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<CCCP> hiya HatsuneMikuFan
<Espeon> That was clearly the superior opinion HML
<Shamroc> side by side of a fat yoko and a hot yoko
<HatsuneMikuFan> OmegaMetroidBrony: (\
<Espeon> because it was a special snowflake
<HyperMetalLugia> lols
<Clover> fighting and drinking are the irish elements of harmony
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Lighty> 06ye sGL they have
<Teh> haha
<HyperMetalLugia> SNES > all
<HyperMetalLugia> Or NES > all
<Viri> 14^
<Lighty> 06but atleast they are better imo
<Viri> 14SNES
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Star Wars: Battlefront 2 is Demigod tier
<That_Irish_Guy> Thats why the world loves us :$
<RX-78-SweetieBot> TTGL yoko? Or Castlevania yoko?
<Alcoholic_Tempest> sweet... im the irish element of drinking then
<Ray> 02SNES > All]
<Viri> 14NES is too choppy sometimes
<Lighty> 06SNES was good
<NightSeas> 02heck, I've even seen Android games with ratings
<Ray> 02I agree
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Shamroc> first
<cowvarkian> fun?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> also fat ichigo: http://i.imgur.com/HvpUN.jpg
<Shizuka> 13moment
<Espeon> every game is prone to ratings as far as i know.
<Lighty> 06too bad i know far better games then on SNES :u
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ah
<RaveBrony> Good afternoon everypony!! :)
<Alcoholic_Tempest> oooh... Battlefront 2 is fun, i love that game
<Clover> wait there 4 elements of irish
<RX-78-SweetieBot> that sounds painful
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Heya RaveBrony
<HatsuneMikuFan> Star Wars: battlefront 2 is like one of the greatest game ever made
<alexxm> hey RaveBrony hows your day been
<Viri> 14I can't find a better platform than Super Mario World o.o </imho>
<That_Irish_Guy> BattleField 1942 Ftw
<Shane377> allo allo eveyrpony
<Espeon> but to sum up my view, anyone viewing ratings as rules/laws and not guidelines should just keep their mouth shut and get out :3
*RaveBrony waves to OmegaMetroidBrony and alexxm :$
<Alcoholic_Tempest> drinking, fighting... swearing and... potatoes? 4 irish elements
<NightSeas> 02^
<Clover> Drinking, fighting, luck and potatoes
<HyperMetalLugia> Because the S/NES has no DLC, no loading times, no bad multiplayer, no disks, has backwords compatability with the GC/portable consoles, it never breaks, it never requires updates
<Viri> 14newer ones seem just too much...easy
<RaveBrony> MY day has been prertty good :)

<Lighty> 06dont know why it shouldnt be a fact
<Lighty> 06in fact
<LadyCanary> :D That's wonderful!
<HyperMetalLugia> It is a fact that it has been ported to almost every single device ever
<Shizuka> 13missed audiosurf but just in time for awesome <3

<icybeauti> Hey guys!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: whats it about
<Espeon> being first doesn't mean it's the best.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ohai LadyCanary, how you doin today?
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> hi icybeauti.
<Espeon> or good even
<Lighty> 06i know
<cowvarkian> the animation looks higher quality
<RaveBrony> Hey there LadyCanary :P
<LadyCanary> As long as I am here for ShizuStream :3
<Espeon> not saying doom isn't good and fun bt
<Shizuka> 13>logging off
<Lighty> 06but think of a worl
<Espeon> ww
<Viri> 14well, I think that people can do anything they want
<Lighty> 06without Doom
<Shizuka> 13>relieves tension
<Lighty> 06no FPS
<Espeon> Some other game would do it.
<ACS13123> True stroy
<Lighty> 06Call of Duty as sidescroller
<icybeauti> Hi Shibakuzou_WallDives
<ACS13123> story
<LadyCanary> RX-78-SweetieBot: Exhausted to say the least. And yourself?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: my oc travels from star wars universe to equestria http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
<Viri> 14but bragging all the time about their scores = no.
<Shizuka> 13you boys~
<Espeon> It's just the natural progression
<Lighty> 06^
<HyperMetalLugia> Wolfenstien was one of the first FPS
<Viri> 14I know many people who do that
<RaveBrony> O.o
<That_Irish_Guy> Imagine them inside BF3
<Lighty> 06WOLFENSTEIN<3
<That_Irish_Guy> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> ;DS
<Bronysith> know what else relieves tension Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: be wait i need to close ponies, i cant see anything
<Lighty> 06i loved that game
<Digitalis> grrr stupid limev, always cutting off on me >.<
<Lighty> 06still do x3
<NightSeas> 02Wolfenstien is awesome
<CCCP> hi icybeauti
<LadyCanary> Doggie!
<Espeon> bragging about video games is in 95% of cases a sign of TIME TO TURN AROUND AND LEAVE
<RX-78-SweetieBot> LadyCanary: just got finished cutting the grass so still sweating
<Lighty> 06yea
<icybeauti> Is this that show with the games? Hey CCCP
*Alcoholic_Tempest glomps Digitalis.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: awesome food
<Lighty> 06i once went in discussion with a bragger
<Lighty> 06k/d ratio shizz
<Shizuka> 13enzo just changed icons again
*Digitalis huggles Alcoholic_Tempest xD
<Lighty> 06i was cruel
<Lighty> 06and too cruel
<Shizuka> 13again, it's important every time
<HyperMetalLugia> Can somebody find me a good FPS game that isn't 100% based on gore and aimless shooting around/zombies
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<Viri> 14I didn't like Wolfenstein because it was a copy of a great SNES game called Super Noah's Ark 3D
*Viri runs
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohwaittheydontexistdothey?
<Shizuka> 13last episode he changed icons to escape detection by the infected Guardians
<Espeon> i've spent plenty of facepalms arguing with people who think they are gods of gaming just because they play in the lower levels of competitive gaming
<Lighty> 06trolled that guy so hard, he didnt come to school for atleast a week
<Lighty> 06xD
<Espeon> seriously some of those people have the biggest egos
<Espeon> on the planet
<Viri> 14^
<Bronysith> ty Shizuka for explaining stuff
<cowvarkian> how long after the first season is this
<Shizuka> 13we're halfway through season 3
<cowvarkian> oh lol
<cowvarkian> :p
<Viri> 14that's why I don't play online much
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> yes he does.
<Espeon> and that's coming from me who's far above thinking comp is NO FUN ALLOWED FOX ONLY etc.
<Viri> 14I love offline gaming x3
<XAX> I am off to school. See ya'll later :D
<Alcoholic_Tempest> lol Gavin
<Shizuka> 13and still debating whether to go on to season 4, cause that doesn't have a good ending..
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey Viri
<cowvarkian> ah
<That_Irish_Guy> What if the User started playing BF3??? They be done in 10 secs XD
<Viri> 14yes?
<HyperMetalLugia> What to know my K/D ratio?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I think you should show it anyway Shizu
<Viri> 14o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> *want
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<Viri> 14which game?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> for whatever my opinion counts
<Viri> 14oh wait, it doesn't matter
<HyperMetalLugia> Any game.
<Viri> 14cuz mine is bigger than yours
*Viri runs
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> downer endings are best.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ahem, any FPS game
<LadyCanary> Would be nice to end the series
<HyperMetalLugia> It is 0/0
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i might read it later, atm a bit busy
<HyperMetalLugia> So I'm better than all of you
<That_Irish_Guy> End the series for what?
<HyperMetalLugia> because there is no percentage for that
<Viri> 14lol
*HyperMetalLugia super sarcasm KFC bucket
<Viri> 14hipster %
<Alcoholic_Tempest> Reboot never ended properly...
<Bronysith> ok twilight_sprinkle and if you like it plz give it a thumbs up and leave a comment cause the more likes the more likely more people will read it
<Lighty> 06i dun even know what hipster means
<Lighty> 06SHOULD I CARE? LOLOLOLOL
<Lighty> 06^
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i keep expecting that pirate to say "snooping as usual i see" >.<
<Viri> 14but anyway
<Lighty> 06typical "dont give a f*ck guy"
<icybeauti> This is buck mazing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WKCBn4l-uQ&feature=BFa&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
<Viri> 14I'm registered to a website where you can record your games, gaming scores etc
<Alcoholic_Tempest> no vid links during stream
<Viri> 14I think I'm the only user who put a "private" mode
<alexxm> theres a stream icybeauti
<HyperMetalLugia> If only lighty has manners and never swore
<icybeauti> Ah :/
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ok
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Bacon[Hazard]> retarded look at mah horse pepz!
<CCCP> "Money can't buy happiness, but it pays for internet, which is pretty much the same thing." - Derpy
<Viri> 14because I don't care what people think xD I have that just to look at how many games I still have to finish
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay not posting scores online?
<L[a]korv> hipster - one who is 'hip', not mainstream, doing something/acting in a way not considered ordinary.
<Lighty> 06SHUT THE F*CK HYPAH, YOU SONOFA BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP
<Lighty> 06trololol~
<Viri> 14I admit it though, sometimes I don't play for fun
<LadyCanary> Hehe. Biscut.
<Espeon> besides having a really low KD ratio is more fun because then the ones with a high one will get more rump-roasted when you beat them
<twilight_sprinkle> come here boy- shows ass
<Lighty> 06i sometimes play in revenge
<CCCP> theres a stream?
<Alcoholic_Tempest> frisket
<Viri> 14but if I want to finish a game then I will do my best

<Lighty> 06me too
<Viri> 14but I want to see the ending
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: no but ive heard its good
<Chrysalis> theres no where near that many girls on the net
<Espeon> i actually like CoD but
<Viri> 14so I keep trying :3
<LadyCanary> You hear right. It's fantastic.

<Ray> 02^
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: here in georgia
<Viri> 14is annoying sometimes, but it's a lot more realistic than "omg someone shot me...wait....wait...wait....ok I'm fine now"

<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Hi Wrek|Observiking.
*Bronysith glomps Wrek|Observiking
<LadyCanary> :D Wreky!!!!!!
<Espeon> the secret is to realize video games are video games
<Ray> 02when someone uses/does a clearly stablished OP thing/Character
<Bronysith> hiya Wrek|Observiking
<Digitalis> hello Wrek|Observiking ^^
<DrLyrus> Hello there, everypon.
<cachi01> alexxm: AWESOME THX :)
<CCCP> Hi Wrek|Observiking
<Espeon> it's a secret art but it's possible through intense soul-searching
<alexxm> hey Wrek|Observiking hows your day been
<DrLyrus> *everypony
<cachi01> hi Wrek|Observiking!!
<Viri> 14lol
<Wrek|Observiking> 05LadyCanary!!
<icybeauti> Oh hi Wrek|Observiking !!!
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'd just forgotten how much of a dick Enzo was during mid S3
<Espeon> and of course mostly because communities sure love collectively banning things that are demanding to learn to adapt too
*LadyCanary huggles Wrek
<Shamroc> LadyCanary..ello!
<alexxm> hey DrLyrus hows your day been
<Viri> 14Espeon
<Espeon> but if something literally is the only viable option then it should be gotten rid of
*Wrek|Observiking huggles back~
<DrLyrus> Good, good.
<Bronysith> hiya DrLyrus
<LadyCanary> Hiya Shamroc
<Viri> 14people need to hate
<Espeon> of course
<Viri> 14being a gaming community = reason to hate people
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its been terrable
<Viri> 14*in a
<Wrek|Observiking> 05i*
<Viri> 14most of times at least
<Bronysith> why bad Wrek|Observiking
<Viri> 14:P
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but ive managed
<Ray> 02^
<alexxm> how come Wrek|Observiking
<That_Irish_Guy> why?
<Espeon> perfect example: people complain CoD needs to change, black ops 2 trailer shows future warfare, "WHY ARE YOU CHANGING THINGS IT'S GOOD AS IT IS"
<Wrek|Observiking> 05right now i jsut want to relax some before i gotta sleep
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/qWQbK
<Wrek|Observiking> 05due to school
<Espeon> stuff like this almost makes one wish for a nuclear winter
<alexxm> hey LadyCanary hows your day been
<Lighty> 06we all have out ups and downs
<cowvarkian> myspace?
<Shizuka> 13it's reboot wrek~<3
<LadyCanary> Hang in there Wrek. <3
<Espeon> but then again using the cod community as an example is pretty trollish in itself
<Viri> 14I find console wars very stupid
<Viri> 14and I said "wars"
<Viri> 14not "polite discussions"
<Espeon> console wars are literally for
<LadyCanary> alexxm: Exhausting to say the least. Hope your day is goin well.
<Espeon> people that should be forced to never go on the internet again
<Espeon> never
<Espeon> again
<cachi01> g2g guys bye!!
<NightSeas> 02http://www.troll.me/images/one-does-not-simply/one-does-not-simply-stop-a-game-from-being-pirated.jpg
<alexxm> it is how come your days been exhausting LadyCanary
<CCCP> bye cachi01
<DrLyrus> Bye cachi01
<icybeauti> This week was exhausting. We had a holocuast survivor come in today.
<Cobellanez> Cya cachi01
<Shamroc> wow thats fucked up
<alexxm> cya cachi01
<Very_Silly_Filly> She's still being held in a rapecellar
<Viri> 14who cares about what's the best console, I still play AOE lol
<That_Irish_Guy> Oh and Wrek hows my firends drawing of my OC and my lover <3 http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d4yg3p1
<Shizuka> 13there's a stealthy joke here
<Shizuka> 13one of the battleships is the SS Cameron
<NightSeas> 02I just buy every console :'D
<Viri> 14and if I cared a lot for graphics, I'd buy a PC and a copy of Crysis 2
<Espeon> if one enjoys whatever they are using why would they care what others enjoy
<cowvarkian> I saw that...
<Alcoholic_Tempest> james cameron?
<That_Irish_Guy> Oh HA! I get it
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> har har.
<Shizuka> 13this is 1997, James Cameron's Titanic was expected to fail
<Viri> 14but graphics =/= quality
<Very_Silly_Filly> S3 was pisstons of references, duh
<Chrysalis> that is horrific
<Very_Silly_Filly> :3
<Shizuka> 13because so much had been spent on it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05nice wings and mane
<LadyCanary> alexxm: Lots of projects, stress, waking up early.
<Espeon> of course a lot of the time it's just people trying to rationalize their purchase by putting down what others pick
<cowvarkian> even though it was one of the highest grossing of all time...
<That_Irish_Guy> Well looks who's laughing now eh?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05think the OC's coat color is a bit dark though
<Espeon> which is equally sad and hilarious
<CCCP> rape
<NightSeas> 02^
<Lighty> 06but this is my opinion: "i DO care about others opinions, but force myself to be as pure minded as ever to rate a game and tell about it in HONESTY, if needed, ill flip the bird to those who just CANT think forthemselves, which prooves they are weak/unpure minded, Gaming is about fun, NOT being an arse about the fact someone plays Halo, and not Cod, some dont like FPS, thats fine, others HATE SNES too! opinions, opinions, opini
<Chrysalis> "its in our genes" weak-will is not genetic, stop blaming others for your weakness
<That_Irish_Guy> Wrek well that is my fav. type of blue :P
<Alcoholic_Tempest> trident of powah
<Viri> 14conclusion of all this discussion

<Lighty> 06dont give a f*ck
<Lighty> 06:D
<Wrek|Observiking> 05jsut mah opinion man
<Espeon> too many people stress that opinions are opinions and then when their opinion is challenged
<Wrek|Observiking> 05:3
<Ray> 02Well, Albert E. said that Human stupity is infinite
<Viri> 14they are in english, so he doesn't understand
<Ray> 02therefore I agree
<Bronysith> HES DUKE NUKEM

<Angel_Umbreon> 13okay I don't normally care about people swearing and such, buuuut there's a swear script on this chat for a reason -w-
<Viri> 14D:

<That_Irish_Guy> Wrek you silly filly :P
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Oh man, JUST as I was about to restart my computer
<Ray> 02LOL
<Espeon> and all I can say is that when stupidity becomes a valid energy source the gaming community better watch out
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I was talking to Lighty LOL
<Ray> 02Anyway
<NightSeas> 02Practically everything in the gaming world is opinions. And there’s nothing wrong with people expressing those opinions if they want.
<Ray> 02*le poof.
<Dark_Horst> Elephant: Reboot
<Angel_Umbreon> 13why is it so difficult to make a point without swearing
<Angel_Umbreon> 13just sayin'
<Shamroc> ANGER

<Lighty> 06sowwy AE
<Shizuka> 13you know... see *now* matrix has a problem with ray
<Ray> 02I feel the urge to play Taiko
<Ray> 02:>
<Alcoholic_Tempest> jealous mode ENGAGED!
*Espeon mega-hugs AE
<Shizuka> 13but in the prison... why so suddenly mad at him
<Espeon> that means that I agree
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3629/
*Ray noms AE's floof
<Ray> 02:3
<Lighty> 06and i know ^^;, sometimes by swearing, others people minds get that certain "click"
<Shizuka> 13FIRE AT WILL! (who's will)
*Angel_Umbreon gives Ray a drumstick?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Poor Will
<Lighty> 06thats what ive intended :P

<Wrek|Observiking> 05nice to see the texture work gettign better by the episode in reboot<3
<Chrysalis> hang on, '09, thats ages ago
<Dark_Horst> ...those battleships look cool... but otherwise they fail pretty hard if military tech cant bring down a simple pirate ship
<Viri> 14I don't like swearing. I don't mind people when do in general, but it annoys me when people insult while gaming :|
<Dark_Horst> it doesn't even look armored, dammit
<cowvarkian> mhmm
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I only really swear around other people when I'm being completely serious about something, or if I'm really pissed off about something xD
<Dark_Horst> NAD HAS A SAIL
<Viri> 14some joke is fine, but people exagerate sometimes
<Dark_Horst> and still no scratch
<That_Irish_Guy> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2109/ BronyState in a nutshell :P
<Shamroc> i think they need more sails..
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Well, maybe this isn't a simple pirate ship
<RX-78-SweetieBot> thats what makes it particularly bad
<Shizuka> 13it's a pirate bay ship
*Lighty doesnt like to brag, but is infact, too damn active with his mind, too much time to think means too much things to discover, like for instance, how the human mind actually works
<cowvarkian> mhmm
<Cobellanez> You can never have enough cubbies
<Viri> 14also
<Cobellanez> chubbies*
<NightSeas> 02unless you consider darn and crap to be swearing, I never swear
<Viri> 14if you swear too much, a purple dragon will appear
<cowvarkian> why is enzo being such a jackass
<Viri> 14:D
<Alcoholic_Tempest> jealousy
<Wrek|Observiking> 05because aliens
<Shamroc> male dominance
<Kandarihu|Mourning> He's worried that Ray is stealing AndrAIa's heart.
<Lighty> 06dundundun
<cowvarkian> because racecar?
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I don't consider "damn" to be a swear, at least it's not considered as one in the UK LOL

<Dark_Horst> waaait... that's not a voyager gold disk
<Umbreon> hi
<Dark_Horst> where did that one come from?
<SpitFire> TheSpitFire
<Shizuka> 13it's the alien disk they found last season
<Shizuka> 13the symbols correspond to the alien sites they've found so far
<RainbowcrashNBurn> wait, wasnt prime dead?
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Swearing can be great for creating humorous or writing funny articles, but not everyone can pull it off xD
<Derpy_at_work> thank you
<Dark_Horst> so... one is alien and the other is from the voyager probe?
<Shizuka> 13and now we know that using it, megs can control their toys
<Shamroc> RainbowcrashNBurn: got reprinted onto a blank
<CCCP> chat is slow today
<Lighty> 06^
<Angel_Umbreon> 13*humour
<That_Irish_Guy> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4486/ O____O???
<Lighty> 06like teachers
<Shizuka> 13you can't kill off the optimus silly <3
<Angel_Umbreon> 13cracked.com is a great example :P
<Umbreon> o-o
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Well, I'll be back in a while
<Lighty> 06teachers swearing IN MY SCHOOL = lotsa laughing
<Ray> 02o-o
<Alcoholic_Tempest> optimus will never die
*OmegaMetroidBrony just finished some damn good noms.
<Kandarihu|> Not for long, anyway
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh yay
<CCCP> OMG.... ITS PINKIES BIRTHDAY TODAY!
<Dark_Horst> kinda reminds me of a zerg hive
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Thanks to the japanese series Optimus dies all the time.
<Alcoholic_Tempest> but thats the japanese
<Alcoholic_Tempest> they kill all their characters
<Very_Silly_Filly> Optimus is immortal
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> dat Tomino.
<Very_Silly_Filly> If you've seen transformers 3, you'd know.
<NightSeas> 02the only times I'll think jokes that are funny is when it's a swear word pun
<Shizuka> 13and the characters they don't kill, they break
<Dark_Horst> optimus is kenny's cousin from idaho
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> a Tomino-written Transformers...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Optimus is the Star Scream of the Autobots
<RX-78-SweetieBot> They kill optimus about five times just to bring him back in a new body stronger than before.
<Very_Silly_Filly> He had his arm cut off and he gave 0.00 reoccuring fucks
<That_Irish_Guy> http://veggie55.deviantart.com/art/Sibling-Rivalry-299508011 Oh Twilight you silly little tatle tale
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> ...that makes me smile.

<Dark_Horst> okay then
<Light_Latias> 12hai Ran :3
<Teh> http://fav.me/d3khkb5
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> later CCCP.
<Shizuka> 13apparently after beast wars just about every transformers iteration had a golden disk macguffin
<Shizuka> 13just shows how good mainframe's writers were
<Alcoholic_Tempest> thats cause beastwars became canon to the series
<Viri> 14same ^^; I think I'll go to sleep soon
<Shizuka> 13well it's canon within G1's timeline, ish
*Viri hugs Ran :D
<Shizuka> 13there's like two other continuity lines according to wiki
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Two? theres alot
<RX-78-SweetieBot> more than that
<SilverSonic> o;
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> more convoluted, Transformers of Zelda?
<SilverSonic> hai all :3
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Transformers continuity is quite a mess.
<Dark_Horst> AJ????
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Transformers.
<Shizuka> 13versions of transofmrers ja, but in terms of which series inhabit which timelines, there's only a handful of timelines
<Dark_Horst> the scorpion is a friggn texan
<That_Irish_Guy> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d4xz9uo This dudes got alot of balls......
<Dark_Horst> someone ship him with aj

<Espeon> anyway*
<NightSeas> 02yeah
<Alcoholic_Tempest> that is awesome
<LadyCanary> It looks like Jabba the Hut and Lord Guru had a baby and it ate a power ring.
<Viri> 14*many
<Dark_Horst> that, rattrap
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Theres G1 cartoon, G1 comics, Japanese post G1 continuity, beastwars 2/neo, generations, armada-energon-cybertron cartoon, armada-energon-cybertron comics, bayverse, and the new aligned continuity
<icybeauti> Derpy was in G1
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and Animated
<Alcoholic_Tempest> nothing can possibly go wrong now... <_< >_>
<LadyCanary> Ikr?
<Dark_Horst> "most important" > sends the wasp
<Dark_Horst> megatron is just BEGGING for problems
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: o god i hate a dream i was stung by tracker jackers
<Bronysith> had Dark_Horst
<icybeauti> Here is G1 derpy. And carrot top is in the backround. http://bronies.memebase.com/?s=G1+Derpy
<Dark_Horst> by wut?
<Espeon> yet again makes me think of the people at my school that went "lol gay childish game" (direct quote) when seeing something tf2-related on my screen.
<Espeon> bonus points if you guess that they only play call of duty, because then you're right
<NightSeas> 02LOL
<Lighty> 06i hear that alot too
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: tracker jackers. they are from the book THE HUNGER GAMES and they were bio enhanced wasps that made you freak the fuck out when you get stung
<Espeon> OKAY i guess people blowing to pieces and being on fire is "childish" because it's cartoony
<Lighty> 06"what is your fav. game Kevin?"
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ...
<icybeauti> Should I get in on the hunger games or not?
<Lighty> 06oh, cant tell, played too many..letts see.....max pay-
<Dark_Horst> aha
<Lighty> 06no Cod? NOOOOB
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Give it a chance
<Bronysith> icybeauti: the book yes. the movie FUCK NO
<Dark_Horst> well... was it a pleasent dream?
<Espeon> if someone said "noob" in real life I
<Lighty> 06thats the moment i realize my previous class was full of mormons
<Kandarihu|> Transwarp? Borg technology?
<Espeon> can't guarantee I wouldn't go HULK SMASH
<That_Irish_Guy> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/608/ All the bronys in chat in a nutshell :P
<Bronysith> no Dark_Horst everything seemed to be directed by michael bay
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Honestly the book is a pain the ass to goet form me
<Bronysith> ty That_Irish_Guy
<Lighty> 06i would punch em IN THE MOUTH
<Lighty> 06:x
<OmegaMetroidBrony> *get
*Bronysith glomps That_Irish_Guy
<icybeauti> Bronysith: But my friend said that all the local libraries don't have the books since they're all taken out. And the waiting list is like 100 people.
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: that sounds like fun, actually
<Shizuka> 13WAIT! the aliens already know about cybertron... remember before the moon sploded, they scanned airazor and muttered "cybertron"
<Espeon> at least it's not as dumb of a word as "scrub"
<Bronysith> Dark_Horst: it wasnt. everything was a hallucination
<Shizuka> 13they already know where these guys are from
<RX-78-SweetieBot> icybeauti: just go watch Battle Royal instead
<Lighty> 06yea
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Shame I'm not in that group
<Espeon> especially as 95% of the people using it uses it when they are actually the scrub
<Lighty> 06someone went like this:
<Lighty> 06-look away-
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh wait... I am :3
<Alcoholic_Tempest> the aliens probably made the first cybertronians
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I call people noobs IRL, in a jokey way of course :'3
<Lighty> 06Babysheepd*ck
<Lighty> 06-look again-
<Lighty> 06i was like
<Lighty> 06LOLwaht?
<icybeauti> RX-78-SweetieBot: I can look that up. I'm just doing metal reserch nowadays and writing.
<Lighty> 06is that even a WORD? ._.
<Shizuka> 13i think in later series they did try to establish that link
<Lighty> 06i litterly asked everyone, is it a word, cuz
<Espeon> dafuq
<Dark_Horst> wait, silverbolt? when did he show up?
<RyunosukeKnT> wait, so if they were sent BACK in time, if the aliens destroy cybertron, that'd create a time paradox wouldnt it?
<Shizuka> 13or at least the aliens being responsible for organic life
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Alcoholic_Tempest: depending on continuity thats only either the Quintesons or Primus and Unicron
<Espeon> And AU that's something elseeee!
<Lighty> 06xcactly
<Dark_Horst> damn, i missed assloads of stuff, didnt i?
<Angel_Umbreon> 13also my mum just got home and I swear I felt the house shake
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> lol, Battle Royale.
<Shizuka> 13rhinox using dat infinite ammo
<icybeauti> Dark_Horst: Not really.
<Alcoholic_Tempest> RX-78-SweetieBot: true
<Angel_Umbreon> 13DID THE DOOR REALLY NEED TO BE CLOSED THAT LOUDLY
<Viri> 14o.o
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Infinite ammo is best ammo
<NightSeas> 02AE, it's me :D
*NightSeas hides
<Espeon> She's marking her territory

<junh1024-XD> also recall humans can't h ear above 20khz

<RX-78-SweetieBot> time for silverbolt x blackarachnia
<RX-78-SweetieBot> alexxm: Kinda.
<junh1024-XD> because 88khz is above 48khz,

<RX-78-SweetieBot> his toy was fucking awesome.
<alexxm> what are they from again OmegaMetroidBrony
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<CK|Asleep> Black Arachnia forgot the most basic rule: Beware the random battles!
<drfsupercenter> 03I don;'t really care
<drfsupercenter> 03also LOL
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Metroid Fusion
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon, I think this HP computer ran so hot that the thermal paste basically melted onto the CPU
<junh1024-XD> also, you can flac and upload to what.cd
<drfsupercenter> 03I just used a bunch of rubbing alcohol and it's not coming off
<alexxm> thanks OmegaMetroidBrony
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I got most of it
<drfsupercenter> 03but there are still marks
<drfsupercenter> 03from where the heat sink was
<drfsupercenter> 03I finally put that quad core in
<Xanbreon> Thats what thermal paste does
<CCCP> that spiders still in my kitchen
<LadyCanary> Surgical...strike...a la Valentine of Skullgirls?
<Xanbreon> It bakes into the cpu and fan
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Protoform X must be the original SA-X
<Invi> optimus looks different and has a surfboard? what happened in the few episodes i didn't watch? :D
<Xanbreon> To provide maximum heat exchange
<TheRainbowDash> Agh, my internet is just being so oppressive to me.:|
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah but usually I can just use rubbing alcohol
<drfsupercenter> 03to wipe it off
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Skullgirls is pissing me off right now...
<alexxm> so is he subbosed to be a crab
<drfsupercenter> 03I got like 99% of it off the heatsink
<Xanbreon> Depends how old it is
<CK|Asleep> Dat guitar
<drfsupercenter> 03but the old dual core has it caked on there
<DerpStar> Crab Starscream is best starscream
<drfsupercenter> 03not that it matters, I'll just have it as a backup
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Invi: second moon was a giant gun, optimus sacrificed himself to destroy it, was brought back from the matrix by rhinox as a transmetal
<drfsupercenter> 03since I doubt I could get much money for a 2.1GHz dual core
*alexxm hugs TheRainbowDash
<Xanbreon> Probs not
<Invi> intresting

<Uakh> rocket jump !
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, but that was like 20 mins ago
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Also, the shockwave from the second moon exploding killed scorpinok and terrorsaur, and turned some of them into their new transmetal forms. Also messed with the pods in orbit, making fuzors like silverbolt and quickstrike
<drfsupercenter> 03and I have short term memory loss

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Beastwars has some messed up stuff
<RainbowcrashNBurn> That_Irish_Guy: is that the original picture (minus the caption) ive only seen it before as the garrus version :P
<DerpStar> Dat 4th wall break PP

<That_Irish_Guy> I dont know :/
<Shizuka> 13THE dinobot episode

<Shizuka> 13but this is my last for today~
<Invi> :(
<alexxm> whats that RX-78-SweetieBot
<LadyCanary> Also, fun fact: C.H. Greenblatt, that dude whom you saw in the opening credits, is the creator of Chowder.
<twilight_sprinkle> this ep is kick-butt
<RX-78-SweetieBot> alexxm: Just wait.
<CK|Asleep> RX-78: Are you referring to Beast Machines?
<DerpStar> I have to go after the next ep of Reboot :/
<CK|Asleep> :|
<LadyCanary> LOL twilight_sprinkle
<FluffyPaint> Lolwut. Spongebob
<FluffyPaint> hahaha
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Math class without headphones or earbuds
<RX-78-SweetieBot> THE DINOBOT EPISODE
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ;_;
<That_Irish_Guy> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2307/ Me when i join the stream :P
<Shizuka> 13no no, transmutate is after the next beast wars
<Digitalis> HA
*Shizuka 13was as organized as spongebob in high school
<FluffyPaint> Hey I know this show comes on every Friday
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Shizuka you sounded a bit like SB there
<FluffyPaint> but before that happens could someone explain it to me and how it works?
<FluffyPaint> because this is my first time here...
<CCCP> http://bit.ly/IHOS1P
<Litwick> Oh shit.
*LadyCanary puts on a happy face
<That_Irish_Guy> dem faces
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Where's the Guy Fawkes mask
<Shizuka> 13happy face~
*OmegaMetroidBrony flips a table
<FluffyPaint> ....hello?
<That_Irish_Guy> Hi
*RainbowcrashNBurn takes off happy face
<Pinkie_Kittie> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai FluffyPaint
<Shizuka> 13woo~
<CK|Asleep> It's been forever since I saw Beast Wars so I barely remember. All I recall is "transmutate" being a common term in the Beast Machines sequel.
<Invi> Shizuka me too at the beginning, but in the end i was like Squidward at work ^^
<Pinkie_Kittie> Dat laugh
<Litwick> Bwoob
<FluffyPaint> Hey, I know this show comes on every Friday
<FluffyPaint> but
<alexxm> hey FlufflyPaint hows your day been
<RainbowcrashNBurn> dat blah blah in background
<FluffyPaint> This is the first time I've been here
<That_Irish_Guy> dat chest hair
<RX-78-SweetieBot> CK|Asleep: ignore Beast Machines. Completely.
<Shizuka> 13CK|Asleep: transmetal is, transmutate was a corrupted bot next ep
<FluffyPaint> and Im not sure how it works
<CCCP> hi FluffyPaint
<Shizuka> 13i've pondered picking up beast machines
<LunaTheBeloved> Bye Chrysa......Nevermind
<FluffyPaint> could someone explain before it comes on tomorrow?
<DerpStar> If only I had said that while I was still in school ...
<RainbowcrashNBurn> mfw, this is the first time ever ive noticed the blah blah in the background
<owlicious> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Shizuka> 13looking at the screenshots on tf wiki it looks very inferior to beast wars though, despite same production company
<FluffyPaint> ....
<FluffyPaint> No one can explain?
<CK|Asleep> I only saw a bit of Beast Machines. It seemed kind of mean-spirited though, like if someone took the Beast Wars canon and was purposely trying to make a mess of it.

<drfsupercenter> 03nothing bad happened
<nickstr> no harm is done but the trans axel locks up for a moment
<Litwick> Since stream's over, I can safely post THIS to help my friend through her rough times.
<CCCP> RainbowcrashNBurn: :$
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Litwick> http://ragecomics.memebase.com/page/2/
<gaybrony91> Eeyup, apparently
<Litwick> Woops wrong link.
<CCCP> Polydunami: who is your favorite pony???
<nickstr> I just did that in my truck
<drfsupercenter> 03of course I realized it right away like "LOL whoops" and turned the car back on, putting it into park
<LadyCanary> My birthday is this month, too! But not for a while ^_^
<Polydunami> CCCP Right now, it's a three-way tie between Rarity, Twilight and Pinkie Pie
<CCCP> LadyCanary happy early b-day!!!!
<LadyCanary> LOLOLOL
<CCCP> Polydunami: hmmm.. :)
<CCCP> one sec
<LadyCanary> You're like, 21 days early, CCCP

<Invi> CCCP don't congratulate too early. that causes bad luck
<That_Irish_Guy> Polydunami http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4498/ ;)
<CCCP> LadyCanary: oh LOL still i wish u a happy birthday :)
<nickstr> I turned the key into the position to start the engine (where just one more position switches on the starter motor) and let the truck roll briefly
<Kandarihu|> Are they illegal aliens or what?
<Invi> yep
<LadyCanary> lel.
<nickstr> then I turned the key back into the lock position and put it in park
<CCCP> Invi: i dont belive in luck, cause if i did i would always get bad luck
<nickstr> then I was able to start the engine without any problem
<Polydunami> Umm... If I were a pony, I would be o////o
<Polydunami> But I prefer a human plot
<Polydunami> I guess :$
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh
<drfsupercenter> 03so Xanbreon I was doing a Windows Experience Index benchmark with the quad core and the fan started spinning really loud to the point where I could hear it with my music on
<CountDoofus> I wonder what the animators were thinking when having Twilight flaunt her rump. "Nope, nobody is sick enough to pull that out of context." trollface.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03is that bad?
<LL-Lunching> 12hmm
<Invi> CCCP i believe in fortune => luck is fortune with good ending ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03BIOS recognizes it fine, though
<That_Irish_Guy> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1565/ ITS ALL TRUE!!!!!!
<LL-Shower> 12time to eat in the shower
<howdyx> People are heresy :D
<DashWithRainbows> suddenly, ValtheJean...
<Cobellanez> I like how plot actually sounds like a legitimate term
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lies
<LL-Shower> 12jk XD
<DashWithRainbows> Oh alright. Val isn't here guys.
<Xanbreon> WEI is crap
<LL-Shower> 12finished eating, going to take a shower
<Syrune> I eat sandwiches in the bath
<Kandarihu|> Hey Val
<LL-Shower> 12brb
<Polydunami> Val who?
<DashWithRainbows> Just some guy with a trident.
<LL-Shower> 12wat
<Pinkie_Kittie> :D
<Xanbreon> But sure, the fan will spin up louder when the cpu is under load
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy
<LL-Shower> 12@Syrune
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's not a bad thing per se?
<CCCP> Invi: everything is a chain reaction there is no fortune
<RainbowcrashNBurn> hiya Val
<That_Irish_Guy> Val is nothing but a machine who we ignore :P
<drfsupercenter> 03It never got loud with the dual core
<LL-Shower> 12anyway, brb
<drfsupercenter> 03but that dual core was a crappy CPU
<Syrune> LL: Something I do when I'm in a rush :p
<CountDoofus> Greetings, ValtheJean
<CCCP> Invi: but u can belive what u want :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well I am an omnipresent, amorphous being of energy
<drfsupercenter> 03soggy sandwiches, yum
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<LadyCanary> Val!!!!!! :D
<CCCP> Invi: cause u might be right C:
<CountDoofus> Didn't Blade Runner teach you anything? Machines have feelings too :'(
<CCCP> Invi: cause im NEVER right
<Syrune> I'm not that stupid XD
<Kandarihu|> I can't watch stream for another hour or so. I hope you won't be streaming stuff I want to see during that time.
<That_Irish_Guy> ValtheJean http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3369/
<NightSeas> 02soggy drfs, yum
*NightSeas runs
<drfsupercenter> 03also
<drfsupercenter> 03http://valid.canardpc.com/show_oc.php?id=2355564
<drfsupercenter> 03Look legit?
<Xanbreon> Dual core had a FAR lower TDP
<RainbowcrashNBurn> ValtheJean: if you are omnipresent, does that mean you know what i type before i press enter???
<Polydunami> Oh my
<NewDCD> 09,01no stream going on guys?
<Xanbreon> Sure looks fine
<drfsupercenter> 03does TDP actually affect the *Fan* though?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 indeed rainbowcrash
<That_Irish_Guy> No :'(
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just power usage ain't it?
<Digit|ArtMode> nope
<Polydunami> Oh hey NewDCD Nothing on at the moment
<NewDCD> 09,01okay
<CountDoofus> Blade Runner... Now there's a movie lottery suggestion.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 And DCD: check SRS
<NewDCD> 09,01I'm gonna test someth-
<drfsupercenter> 03lemme install PC Wizard on here
<drfsupercenter> 03and run prime95
<drfsupercenter> 03see what happens LOL
<Xanbreon> Higher power usage > more heat > hotter > fan spins moar to cool it down
<That_Irish_Guy> test something?
<Invi> CCCP lol you can't say that. Never say never.
<NewDCD> 09,01ah okay, nevermind
<drfsupercenter> 03true
<LadyCanary> :D DCD!!!!! So good to see you <#
<CCCP> Invi: why?
<NewDCD> 09,01just wanted to test something
<drfsupercenter> 03also gtfo Windows
<CCCP> hi NewDCD
<Kandarihu|> BTW, what's the resolution of the stream? 640x480?
<drfsupercenter> 03I know it's not genuine >_>
<That_Irish_Guy> Invi what? Cupcakes?
<howdyx> http://s1.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2012/04/34c7deb2e20b8a39878384cde3f389f7.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03I just installed it like 20 mins ago
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well DCD, if wrek doesn't respond, you're welcome to take my spot
<drfsupercenter> 03and didn't enter a serial
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
*Invi gives That_Irish_Guy a cupcake
<drfsupercenter> 03Enterprise whines if you don't activate it asap
<CCCP> http://bit.ly/IHY1re
<CountDoofus> howdyx: those eyes are freaking me out.
<Polydunami> Madskills?
<That_Irish_Guy> Because of CCCP i now have to shoot myself
<howdyx> yep :D
<CCCP> howdyx: i want
*That_Irish_Guy shoots himself
<Polydunami> I had Greek food today
<CCCP> That_Irish_Guy: why? :O
<NightSeas> 02drf
<Invi> CCCP my books about quantum physics showed me, that everything is possible, even if very very [...] very ulikely
<Invi> *unlikely
<NightSeas> 02enter the serial! >:@
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I *can* activate it 500 times
<drfsupercenter> 03but why waste one?
<Polydunami> Lamb is delicious
<CCCP> Invi: so pinkie pie is real?
<That_Irish_Guy> Invi....whats in this cupcake?????
<NightSeas> 02XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just gonna wipe it out again anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03this was just a fast install so I can benchmark
<drfsupercenter> 03yes I know WEI is crap but it's better than nothing
<Invi> CCCP possibly yes ^^
<CCCP> That_Irish_Guy: ?
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so
<NightSeas> 02ah
<drfsupercenter> 03according to PC Wizard, the cores are only at 48.5C
<Invi> That_Irish_Guy a super laxative dose
<drfsupercenter> 03is that good?
<FlareChaser> Look whos back my children! :D
<FlareChaser> Flare is back :|
<Polydunami> Oh hey FlareChaser ;)
<Xanbreon> Thats fine
<That_Irish_Guy> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03mainboard temp is at 65, LOL
<howdyx> CCCP you're rus?)
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's a crap tiny case so it makes sense
<That_Irish_Guy> FLARECHASER!
<drfsupercenter> 03mfw the video card is only at 45
<alexxm> hey FlareChaser hows your day been
<FlareChaser> alexxm: Good, good....
<Pinkie_Kittie> Hai FlareChaser
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's a relatively low-end NVIDIA, not a high end as it had to be low profile
<Polydunami> I'm busy tonight
<CCCP> howdyx: nope lol
<FlareChaser> Hao Pinkie_Kittie
<drfsupercenter> 03and GTS520 was the best I could get :/
<Invi> moin FlareChaser
<CCCP> hi FlareChaser
<CCCP> hi Pinkie_Kittie
<That_Irish_Guy> FlareChaser http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d4y0u5d ;)
<Silent> .........:|
<CCCP> That_Irish_Guy: WHAT DID I DOOOO?!!!
<Cobellanez> Hey FlareChaser
<FlareChaser> That_Irish_Guy: 10/10 would cuddle.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh hey it cooled off by a few degrees
<drfsupercenter> 03now lemme run prime95 for like 15 mins
<FlareChaser> Hello Cobellanez !
<LadyCanary> I wants to cuddle ;3;
<Shamroc> oh hello FlareChaser
<Cobellanez> I want to stop being so hot
<drfsupercenter> 03should I run it longer to let the thermal paste "settle" or whatever?
<Cobellanez> The sun shines right on my bed
<Cobellanez> Its annoying
<FlareChaser> Hello Shamroc....
<That_Irish_Guy> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3271/
<Cobellanez> Humid too
<Silent> i haven't eaten all day.
<Invi> Silent then eat now
<Silent> cant
<Cobellanez> I'd love to "hug an dash"
<Xanbreon> Doesnt matter
<CCCP> Silence of the ponies
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Silent> has to do with the oven being broke.
<Polydunami> Cobellanez: It's hot where you are right now?
<Xanbreon> It can cook in over time
<drfsupercenter> 03I know some people say you have to burn it in
<drfsupercenter> 03but I figured that was mostly hype
<Cobellanez> Hot and humid
<Cobellanez> Mainly because the sun is shining right on me
<Xanbreon> Meh, only really need to if you are going to srsly overclock it out of the gate
<Polydunami> I see
<drfsupercenter> 03I also did the "put a small pea-size drop in the middle" approach rather than trying to spread it
<FlareChaser> So, what did you guys do yesterday? I wasnt here.
<Xanbreon> Otherwise, just let it cook over time
<Polydunami> It's about fifty here in Vancouver
<Invi> FlareChaser we exsisted
<drfsupercenter> 03OK wow um
<Cobellanez> I still didn't play l4d
<FlareChaser> wat
<Xanbreon> Errh, did you follow the instructions for your CPU
<drfsupercenter> 03running Prime95 here
*Silent has clouds looming over, waiting for the inevitable storm
<drfsupercenter> 03it's up to 70C
<Xanbreon> As you need to get the paste over the cores
<drfsupercenter> 03fas are at max
<drfsupercenter> 03*fans
<Polydunami> 50 = 10 celsius
<Xanbreon> Did you use the stock fan?
<Cobellanez> Our storm was last week
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Silent> figuratively, not literally.
<CCCP> http://bit.ly/nGoPl0
<drfsupercenter> 03the fan is part of the case, not the heatsink
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a passive heatsink
<alexxm> night guys
<Xanbreon> And there in lies half your heat issues
<Cobellanez> LOL
<Wrek|Observiking> 05finally
<CCCP> night alexxm
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Remenant power armor
<Wrek|Observiking> 05<3
<CCCP> hi Dark92Enigma
<Cobellanez> Wb Dark92Enigma
<drfsupercenter> 03do they even make active heatsinks for low profile cases?
<Polydunami> Hello Wrek and Dark92Enigma ;)
<LadyCanary> Wreky Wrek Wrek :3 :3
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm hello and goodnight!
<That_Irish_Guy> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1008/ This is why no human should insult us :D
<Xanbreon> You would have to look
<drfsupercenter> 0372.5C now
<Xanbreon> Measure the clearance
<drfsupercenter> 03yay space heaters
<drfsupercenter> 03at what point should I worry about the CPU killing itself?
<Shizuka> 13the observiking
<Shizuka> 13is here
*LadyCanary giggles.
<CCCP> http://bit.ly/IqaNbq
<Shizuka> 13i'm going to regret watching the mlp vector club group...
<Xanbreon> Spec sheet says 61deg is the max
<Shizuka> 13so many notifications...
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's far past that now
<drfsupercenter> 03it's now at 73.5
<drfsupercenter> 03should I turn it off?
<Xanbreon> Means its underclocking itself like crazy
<Xanbreon> I would stop running prime95
<Cobellanez> ?
<Xanbreon> and find yourself better cooling
<Xanbreon> I did say that stock cooling most likely wouldnt do the job >__>
<valoreins> ohai everypony!
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah the fan slowed down almost immediately after killing prime95
<Kandarihu|> Vector Club?
<Cobellanez> Hey valoreins
<CCCP> http://bit.ly/KtJGwl
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's down to 50C again
<drfsupercenter> 03well lemme shut it off, I'll show you what I'm talkinga bout with the cooling
<drfsupercenter> 03as it's some custom crap HP did
<valoreins> seems like the chat is quiet now
<FlareChaser> hey kids! :D

<CCCP> Dark92Enigma: lol :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd just leave that fan there *and* have active cooling?
<Litwick2> Hey mods, why is tinychat being a butthole?
<Xanbreon> Sure
<Litwick2> Try kicking Litwick.
<Xanbreon> Just line up the direction of air flow
<Xanbreon> If you have a side to side fan
<drfsupercenter> 03I think the one I found at the store has a vertical fan
<Invi> Litwick wait for it. he auto disconnects after a while not chatting

<Invi> OmegaMetroidBrony you missed SB doing the webcam stream?
<Biglaw> Polydunami nope.
<Xanbreon> But that fan plus the case one should keep it cool enough
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Wait....
<Polydunami> Even when you speak Dutch?
<Gunthler> how does a pony type? :D
<ehm> Biglaw : no one thinks they do, but there's always a classification :p
<OmegaMetroidBrony> SB does have a pretty sexy voice as well
<Biglaw> Polydunami I do not speak dutch, I live in Canada
<Polydunami> Gunthler: They get lessons from Pinkie Pie
<Polydunami> Oh yeah
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Armor in that collapsed building
<Monfang> I don't think there are anything bad in the Recommendations this time, so if you want to listen in, here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwcJorJp_Aw&feature=g-u-u
<Biglaw> Polydunami I know maybe 3 words in dutch
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh you already got it...

<Gunthler> Monfang: No video inks during streaming
<Monfang> Oh ya, I didn't see that big flashing light that said there was a stream going on
<Xanbreon> Cos im fed up of DDos
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello HatsuneMikuFan
<Derpy_Hooves> looooooool
<Ascendant> I know
<Ascendant> I saw it
<ehm> that reminds me... stream status should be stated for those not viewing it.
<Xanbreon> if this carries on ill get a cheapbox for your ZNC <censored> or kick you off
<Xanbreon> >__>
<Biglaw> Rocket launcher!
<HatsuneMikuFan> Fallout 3 or New Vegas?
<Xanbreon> Most likerly the 1st
<Biglaw> HatsuneMikuFan vegas
<Monfang> Right there in the topic
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol Deathclaws want some of Wrek's hugs :3
<Xanbreon> As rapidxen do cheap 128meg boxes, and the ips are per account so
<That_British_Guy> ded
<Ascendant> well, pretty sure it's dalnet
<Invi> it's a xenomorph
<Monfang> 'Stream Status: Live"
<HatsuneMikuFan> okay, thank you
<Invi> ouch
<OmegaMetroidBrony> This is actually a reasonable time to use VATS
<Invi> super hug hurts
<ehm> Monfang : you're looking at a different "topic"
<Xanbreon> Just ban dalnet tbh
<Gunthler> Dat deathclaw :D
<Xanbreon> Shits not worth the effort
<ehm> /topic
<OmegaMetroidBrony> BTW AMR doesn't really do shit on the either :
<Polydunami> I hope I get the B-movie
<Polydunami> The Wizard is my pick
<Monfang> how about this, if you aren't watching the stream and you want to hear what was said about bronies, let me know and I'll PM you the link.
<Ascendant> I will be
<Invi> he only wants to hug you :(
<Ascendant> when flame comes back up
<Ascendant> -_-
<That_British_Guy> dat glitch
<Biglaw> cheap shot
<ZappyTheUnicorn> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Invi, Deathclaw hugs are almost as unpleasant as Metroid hugs...
<Digitalis> =_(\
<Biglaw> just like the guant supermutant
<Biglaw> giant*
<HatsuneMikuFan> That's how I kill death claws too!
<That_British_Guy> Wrek that was cheep
<That_British_Guy> sssssssssooooooooooooooo cheap
<Xanbreon> Good
<Invi> OmegaMetroidBrony that's right but it's still sad :(
<Monfang> Listen, while they didn't have much GOOD to say about grown men liking a show intended for young girls (You can't deny that at the start it was indended for young girls) they do raise valid points about some people using the show as a way to excape reality.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It's killing him with hugs... I would only allow ponies to do such a thing
<That_British_Guy> :P
<Biglaw> Monfang Shhh... Don;t say that kind of stuff
<Digitalis> ....
<Digitalis> and...
<That_British_Guy> Wrek http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/732/
<Biglaw> don't*
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: everyone wants to escape reality
<Digitalis> ^
<Invi> Monfang isn't every entertainment to escape reality?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Fuck Reality
<TheSpitFire> me too
<Polydunami> SWAG
<Gunthler> OmegaMetroidBrony: I agree :D
<Monfang> Yes, but only momentarily. They raise poits about some people wanting to escape for good.
<Digitalis> I don't blame them.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Depends on how they do it....
<HatsuneMikuFan> brb dinner time
<That_British_Guy> The world would be 100000000000000X better without reality
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: if i would get to live in ponyville, id like to escape for good
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid Micro Center
<drfsupercenter> 03let's try this again
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Self inflicted = weak, accidental = okay I guess
<drfsupercenter> 03OK there
<drfsupercenter> 03"pay at the store", fun stuff
<Monfang> Escaping from reality should be a luxery enjoyed only after all your duties are completed.
<drfsupercenter> 03so they'll have it in 18 mins
<drfsupercenter> 03and of course it takes me an hour to get there
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<drfsupercenter> 03I shoudl go
<Biglaw> na
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Living it out till the end = Best way to go if you "Win" life
<drfsupercenter> 03not like they care if I take longer than 18 mins, just saying XD
<Digitalis> haha..
<Invi> lol that was a good joke Monfang
<That_British_Guy> and the fact that you can only die of old age is really.....
<Gunthler> I wish I had a magical wardrobe, like in the Chronicles of Narnia, that lead to Equestria :S
<Monfang> I myself don't want to leave.
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: if you mean escaping mentally, then maybe. but if for real, then id go to ponyville anyday
<NewDCD> 09,01GREAT SUCCESS!!
<NewDCD> 09,01Using my PSP as a second monitor
<That_British_Guy> what?

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Fireheart
<drfsupercenter> 03I called Hitachi and bugged them for like 10 mins
<drfsupercenter> 03to give me a tracking number
<Monfang> If I had a choice to stay or leave, I'd stay. I like some of the things this world offers. I can't play Guild Wars 2 or any of my favorite video games in Equestria.
<drfsupercenter> 03the RMA'd laptop drive will be here by tomorrow
<Biglaw> Perk1
*Fireheart brb
<drfsupercenter> 03according to UPS
<Biglaw> !
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'll have the scorpio black I bought AND that XD
<Monfang> I can't enjoy meat in Equestria. It talks back!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol I'd sure miss eating meat in Equestria
<drfsupercenter> 03which is fine, my PS3 needs a bigger hard drive, 60GB is tiny
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: video games over peace and friendship?:|
<Invi> NewDCD oh you god of electronic devices. How did you do that?
<Monfang> How peaceful is it really?
<Biglaw> I think I'd only miss bacon and steak, but I would manage
<Monfang> What has happened in Ponyville ever sense Twilight showed up?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Semi-Relevant: http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-014
<NewDCD> 09,01TYPAN FROM PSP SCREENAN
<PinkieLovesMe> I wouldnt care about meat if i had
<PinkieLovesMe> the magikz
<Biglaw> NewDCD dat typin is gud
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: well it was more peaceful until they got a wider demographic to satisfy :P
<ZappyTheUnicorn> brb
<Invi> why do they need pigs?.....
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Good point PinkieLovesMe but what if you didn't have... The Magikz?
<PinkieLovesMe> :o
<PinkieLovesMe> Then...
<PinkieLovesMe> Idk
<Biglaw> Monfang ponyville was saved from an ursa minor
<Monfang> Their Princess was kidnapped, they nearly got trapped in eternal night, their town got eaten by parasprites, it was attacked by a Spirit of Chaos and the Cerberus, attacked by an Ursa Minor.. Have I forgotten anything?
<Invi> and it has a hellgate with a 3 headed dog
<PinkieLovesMe> Thers prob a way to make a plant taste like meat in equestria
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<Invi> PinkieLovesMe or just use magicks
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: when was the princess kidnapped
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'd learn that magikz
<Monfang> It's not all roses and rainbows.
<PinkieLovesMe> Yes
<Monfang> Episode ONE, Twilight

<Biglaw> O_O Dat Launch
<That_British_Guy> Wait....A NUKE!?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> INCOMING TACITICAL NUKE!
<SirGanjalf> Nuke Launch Detected!
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: she was kidnnapped? i thought she just did nothing
<Fireheart> Monfang you forgot the Changelings
<Monfang> Remember? "The Princess is MISSING!"
<Invi> Monfang not sure if kidnapped or just hiding
<Biglaw> Kaboom!
<PinkieLovesMe> :O
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Watch it Wrek...
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: so?..
<Monfang> Changlings attacked Canterlot, not Equestria

<SirGanjalf> dat shroom
<That_British_Guy> CODE BLACK! CODE BLACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Monfang> *Not Ponyville
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Watch it in all of it's glory...
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: she came from nowgere at the end, shhe wasnt kidnapped
<SirGanjalf> DEFCON1!
<Biglaw> 0_0
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: she was just being useless
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Now you should be experiancing and EMP effect shortly
<Monfang> Oh that's a nice suggestion. She ran.
<PinkieLovesMe> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: well thats what she normally did
<Monfang> Some Faithful Student you are.
<Fireheart> Looks like a futuristic Portal
<PinkieLovesMe> Sad beeping?
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: what did she do when discord showed up?
<Ray> 02Yay, 220bpm songs
<That_British_Guy> So what did you nuke?????
<Ray> 02with nearly no effort
<Teh> What i thought during christmas http://mlfw.info/f/1277/
<SirGanjalf> @twilight_sprinkle: So she was just cowering while mane6 did their job?
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: nothing
<Invi> Monfang she was trapped in a cocon if that counts...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Obstacles
<RoxyPony_SWAG> First time heer!
<Biglaw> So what does radiation do to you exactly in Fallout?
<Monfang> Put a sheild up around Canterlot thanks to Shining Armor
<RoxyPony_SWAG> Howdy,yall.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Keels you
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai RoxyPony_SWAG
<Monfang> Thus saving as many lives as possible
<Shamroc> oh god this place
<twilight_sprinkle> SirGanjalf: from a practical view, yes
<Monfang> Because you know Discord's attack harmed if not out right killed ponies.
<Polydunami> Oh hey RoxyPony_SWAG Welcome to Bronystate ;)
<RoxyPony_SWAG> xD :6_9
<PinkieLovesMe> :o
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: lol? shining armor did that, not her
<SwaggyStarfield> Dear Santa, WHERE IS MY FUKIN PONIEZ
<Monfang> Shining Armor would need the extra magic to hold Discord back.
<Meanwhile> Oh look, it's "watch Wrek be eaten by Deathclaws" hour.
<drf|away> 03oh jeez
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<drf|away> 03it is pouring HARD out there
<OmegaMetroidBrony> SwaggyStarfield: Go to Youtube for ponies if not stay for the games and art
<SirGanjalf> I'd say that was NOT BIG SURPRISE, but i don't find moon that interesting
<Biglaw> Dear Santa, I've asked you for the last time, give me a dashie, or I will eat Rudolf
<drf|away> 03I'm gonna be soaked before I even get to the car x.x
<Invi> moin Meanwhile
<Polydunami_> Okay, fuck iris
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hey Meanwhile
<Polydunami_> Oh yeah
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: lol when he got migraines, who helped him? not celestia, pseudo-cadence did
<SwaggyStarfield> OmegaMetroidPony lol ik
<NewDCD> 09,01http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/8393/img20120503182653.jpg
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Soz
*SwaggyStarfield afk
*Polydunami_ pours RoxyPony_SWAG a mug of cider. Newcomers' standard :)
<NewDCD> 09,01http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/8505/img20120503182644.jpg
<Monfang> Because there was no need forCelstia to help because she believed Cadence was there.
<NewDCD> 09,01SCIENCE
<Monfang> Also, wasn't he getting migranes due to the mind control spell?
<SwaggyStarfield> http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/8393/img20120503182653.jpg
<OmegaMetroidBrony> NewDCD: I am the jelliest of jellies right now because of that.
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: so again, she did nothing
<Meanwhile> I take it my mIRC won't connect because it hates me then
<PinkieLovesMe> Lol
<Monfang> She isn't perfect. But I think that is better than calling her a coward.
<PinkieLovesMe> Sister gets beat updoes nothing
<Monfang> Are you calling Princess Celestia a coward?
<Invi> oh NewDCD how? :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: i didnt
<PinkieLovesMe> to the MOOOOOooooon
<Monfang> But you said she ran and did nothing.
<Monfang> Right?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I'm back. Did I miss anything important?
<Polydunami_> Oh yeah. Hey Meanwhile :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: i said she was absent when the ep 1 stuff happened, not that she ran
<SwaggyStarfield> ZappyTheUnicorn: You missed me
<Monfang> Twilight Sprinkle called Celestia a coward, Zappy
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Celestia is gettin beat at every turn... so much for hundreds of years of wisdom
<RX-78-SweetieBot> quiet
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi SwaggyStarfield.
<Monfang> And I'm saying she was absent because Nightmare Moon had kidnapped her.
<Meanwhile> It wouldn't be a very interesting show if all that needed to happen was have Celly wave her horn.
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: oh ok then you called jesus a prick.
<Invi> ZappyTheUnicorn newDCD uses his PSP as PC-monitor for chat
<Monfang> What other reason was there for her to be absent?
<Polydunami_> Celestia has a Xanatos mind
<Polydunami_> ... Mostly
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: seriously, lying about what i did to others, who arent even a part of this?
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: what the hell man
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I see...
<Litwick> Princess Celestia eats cake again.
<PinkieLovesMe> those little creepie thingies
<Monfang> I'm not lying
<Monfang> You said she ran away
<Meanwhile> Good to know that chat is having a stupid convo.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> More Deathclaws to hug :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: it was half-sarcastic, i meant she wasnt there
<Meanwhile> Seriously, I've seen it for like, a minute, and it sucks.
<Digitalis> lol xD
<SirGanjalf> I wouldn't call that cowardice, rather a "drama sense": Like when she was just standing there doing nothing, letting Chrysalis finish her rant.
<Litwick> Wait, this chat had another arguement?
<NewDCD> 09,01brb
<Digitalis> seems like it Litwick
*OmegaMetroidBrony gets hugged by ALL the Deathclaws... Including Rawr ;~;
<Monfang> Sarcasm is about tone of voice, youc an't communicate sarcasm over text unless you flat out state it.
<Polydunami> Okay, back to form again
<Litwick> Well, since I don't want to get postreading cancer, I won't bother seeing what it is.
<Meanwhile> So my mIRC is unable to resolve server. What do?
<PinkieLovesMe> True
<Gunthler> Monfang: I just watched that trifecta vid, I believe many of their points were invalid. They keep saying it was a show for toddler girls, Faust herself even said she made the show for kids AND their parents...
<Digitalis> hehe
<Phase4> Meanwhile, pinkie pie is down, thats probably it
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3fa87oqdS1qjvsoxo1_500.gif
<xmasskills> hello all my fellow bronies
<owlicious> try applejack.ponychat.net?
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Ah. Ty.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Rawr gives the manliest hugs ever
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai xmasskills
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: yeah well about you dont talk crap that isnt even true about me to others
<Ascendant> I swear
<Ascendant> this isn't a DDoS
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello xmasskills
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hugs so manly, if you can out man him, he gives you his hand to kill others with.
<Monfang> Gunthler: The guy on the right was bitting at the bit to talk about this. I suspect he was being harsher than he really wanted to be. But I doubt any of them saw the show really.
<ehm> Meanwhile, use the main round-robin: irc.ponychat.net
<Polydunami> RX-78-SweetieBot: http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Kipkat07_Mare> http://i.imgur.com/vHe88.jpg
<Invi> lol suddenly chat ded
<SirGanjalf> RX-78-SweetieBot: MY MIND:O
<Gunthler> RX-78-SweetieBot: What the heck, I can't comprehend wat is happening in that picture :D
<Monfang> Twilight, I can't tell. Are you being sarcastic or not?
<Kipkat07_Mare> http://i.imgur.com/NJ79j.jpg
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Who the hell makes all those button websites?
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: how do you imagine sarcasm would even work here?
<Meanwhile> Success.
<Meanwhile> Thanks Phase4.
<Monfang> I don't know, you said you were being sarcastic.
<Monfang> I'd think you know.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, np
<Gunthler> Monfang: Yeah, I don't think any of em saw the show...
<Polydunami> I dunno, button websites are strange
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: think a little before you talk and accuse someone of something
<SwaggyStarfield> file:///C:/Users/Breauna/Music/Save%20changes%20to%20Untitled_.png
<Kipkat07_Mare> http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/2pfV18/:h!TPfMpY:bm+5ioC@/belarr.com/bakercat/
<Monfang> Gunthler: Most likely, however I do agree with their assement about people escaping from reality with the show. I've seen it happen with Furries and Otherkin.
<Cobellanez> Someone should stream Planescape: Torment :o
<Gunthler> Monfang: Yupo.
<Meanwhile> Dat file.
<Monfang> Are you being sarcastic or can I reply to that one, Twilight?
<RoxyPony_SWAG> Cant see a THING!
<ehm> lol, Monfang
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nukes... fixes and break ALL THINGS
<Litwick> I just bought super Paper Mario today. Haven't palyed it yet though. Is it any good?
<Meanwhile> Can't see shit Captain.
<RoxyPony_SWAG> Stupid computer! >:U
<That_British_Guy> dem bots
<Polydunami> Litwick: Don't expect too much
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: ugh forget it, youre not keeping up. and id appreciate if you would take back what you said to zappy
<Polydunami> I have that game and I do enjoy it
<Litwick> I have heard good things about it though.
<SirGanjalf> dat lazor
<Monfang> I can't tell, is Twilight being Sarcastic or is he being serious?
<Meanwhile> Detonate ALL the warheads!
*Kipkat07_Mare is sad
<RoxyPony_FASHION> RaritySWAG
<RoxyPony_FASHION> >:D
<Meanwhile> Why sad Kipkat07_Mare.
<Polydunami> Litwick: It's better to form your own opinion about it
<Monfang> I have to assume sarcasm unless he says otherwise.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> What's wrong Kipkat07_Mare?
<ehm> This sentence is sarcastic.
<RoxyPony_FASHION> is Confues
<Polydunami> Why is that funny.
<Monfang> Oh that'd make a good logic bomb, ehm
<RoxyPony_FASHION> confused*
<RoxyPony_FASHION> xD
<Cobellanez> No one knows when I'm sarcastic on the internet, but no one knows when I'm sarcastic in real life :s
<That_British_Guy> well im gonna go get my haircut now....cya!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: no-it-was-not
<RoxyPony_FASHION> :O
<ehm> Monfang : are you being sarcastic?
<Meanwhile> Bye That_British_Guy.
<RoxyPony_FASHION> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai That_British_Guy
<Gunthler> Wrek|Observiking is best sniper :D
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Bye That_British_Guy
<RoxyPony_FASHION> :U
<Meanwhile> Wait, That_British_Guy it's like midnight
<Polydunami> Whoops
<Meanwhile> Who gets a haircut at midnight.
<Cobellanez> Obser-viking?
<That_British_Guy> not where im at Meanwhile
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I need to pirate some more ponies...
<Monfang> Oh well Twilight, let me put my serious pants back on. /sarcasm (see what I did there?)
<Cobellanez> lol
<Meanwhile> That_British_Guy: it can't be that different where you are.
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: youre a waste of my time.
<Monfang> Bye
<ehm> haha
<Kipkat07_Mare> Meanwhile: I have started to realize that, throughout my life, I have been in the worst schools in the country and I most likely wont get into an Ivy League college like I have dreamed of.
<That_British_Guy> Meanwhile Im in North Carolina USA
<That_British_Guy> :P
<Meanwhile> That_British_Guy: Your name is misleading.
<Kipkat07_Mare> Meanwhile: And its too late to change that
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No one said he wasn't an immigrant
<twilight_sprinkle> Monfang: oh and btw trolling nullifies all your credibility.
<SirGanjalf> There should be a punctuation mark for sarcasm
<owlicious> There is one
<Monfang> I thought I was a waste of your time, yet you come crawling back. Am I just that sexy, Twilight?
<RoxyPony_FASHION> I'm happy! Oh,wait sorry...it's not Friday. :D

*Mutterguy gets the.... Umbrella
<SparkleButt> I've seen this like three times on the stream and still have no idea what the original anime is.
<Dken2021> SparkleButt it's Gurren Laggan
<Alister> Spike would be the better choice for Viral : Non-Pony - Non-Spiral
<ValtheJean> 2,14 SparkleButt: -_-
<SparkleButt> Alright, thanks!
<SparkleButt> Is it worth watching?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I play it as an introduction to my Gurren Lagann streams -_-
<Dken2021> SparkleButt hellz to the yeah!
<RoboGerbil> lol.. they arent saying what those subtitles are saying
<Shamroc> ... ValtheJean great hint
<SunderlandPony89> innuendo deteched
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: btw did we finish red dwarf?
<Shamroc> RoboGerbil: kinda hard to get them too..
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, I just need to find my season 7 disc
<twilight_sprinkle> ook
<Alister> @ValtheJean spoiling the ending to introduce people to the series. This confirms my theory tthat you are a troll
<Death> Japanese Transformer Diebuster?
<Death> With alchemists?
<Petrified_Discord> Huzzah, time for ponies! :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because this spoils so much?
<Alister> ye
<Alister> yes
<Alister> IT'S THE ENDING
<kirzstryfe> 1,3technically they spoil it themselves in the first episode
<SunderlandPony89> MFW I found out there is a brony living a few blocks away from my house : http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/143/
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a PMV
<Kencolt> Tenga Toppa Gurren Lagaan. Insanely over the top, an excuse for some of the most insane fnservice, utterly preposterous concet, totally ridiculous mecha, and a premise that makes no sense at all. And somehow it STILL manages to be one of the most awesone anime ever.
<Dken2021> because I lost control of my life
<Alister> The final fight is not nearly as awesome without the buildup
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and anyone who hasn't watched Gurren Lagann has no fucking idea what's going on

<Kencolt> Yes, Sumica . He made all that stuff up.
<cowvarkian> who knows
<otakon> Sumica: told
<Reikim> Sumica: It's the symbolism of the book.
<Death> Bau5ness
<Alister> storm: old news
<kirzstryfe> 1,3he made it all up...

<Petrified_Discord> He actually found the book
<Mutterguy> 11 months rarely
<kirzstryfe> 1,3wait he had a bible?
<CupcakeWarrior> Im back from psychological testing!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:3
<RAWRity> I just learned something horrifying, and kind of hilarious
<Reikim> Sumica: Nobody else can read, so how are they supposed to disagree with him?
<otakon> kirzstryfe: kind of
<Admin> Mods thought they'd get rid if me that easy... Nice try
<Death> WHAT NOW?
<Mutterguy> *really
<Admin> That's why my name is admin...
<SunderlandPony89> That was... meh
<twilight_sprinkle> yay
<Spell-of-Gaming> What is it, RAWRity?
<twilight_sprinkle> code geass ftw
<Sumica> 00,10Dat code geass
<Dken2021> RAWRity yes?
<otakon> Admin: dude, don't taunt them just don't advertise
<Shizuka> 13ooo a wiseass
<Reikim> Gurren Lagann, followed by Code Geass? It's like all of my favourite shows, one after the other!
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: moo
<kirzstryfe> 1,3you were kicked, Admin, you really want to push it?
<RAWRity> You guys are familiar with the Ghibli films, correct?
<Shizuka> 13i like wiseasses
<Sir_lockpicker> on
<Dken2021> yes
<Admin> I wasn't advertising... Didn't mean to at least
<Magic> wow celestia radio who knew
<cowvarkian> but I love taunting the mods
<Death> RAWRity: no.
<Admin> Sorry
<Shizuka> 13they make a nice crunchy sound when you squish them
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Pom Poko?
<Alister> Just when I start to give anime a chance. some does a bland PMV with a anime song. WAY TO MAKE ME HATE ANIME EVEN MORE
<cowvarkian> just not when they can see it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the real question is who gets to have fun with him?
<twilight_sprinkle> and then he turned out to be an IRCop :P
<Reikim> RAWRity: Studio Ghibli kicks ass.
<Kencolt> RAWRity: Think I've seen the most of them.
<otakon> SEE! HE's sorry don't ban him dammit!
<Admin> Mods are fun, just don't piss them off...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we mods do get SO bored when trolls don't show themselves for very long
<Reikim> Alister: Have you seen Code Geass yet?
<otakon> that's the right attitude
<MakerDusk> am I fun too, Admin?
<Shizuka> 13mods are fun, they add content to your game and don't afraid of anything
<kirzstryfe> 1,3let's see, speaking of another site's services, then linking to their feed, that would count as advertising
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we need a good banning every now and again to feed our joy of inflicting pain
<Alister> Reikim: why should I ?
<RAWRity> Well, I just learned that, back in the day, in japan, "My Neighbor Totoro" was released as a double feature...alongside "Grave of the Fireflies"
<Admin> I know I know... Sorry
<twilight_sprinkle> oh come on mods let the guy have a little fun, if hee keeps advertsing then ban him
<SunderlandPony89> Alister: I'm in the same boat too. I'm yet to find an anime that has peaked my interest
<otakon> ValtheJean: you are a cruel bastard
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, yes I am
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and I love it
<Reikim> Alister: I was just wondering. Personally I enjoyed it, though I know it's not everyone's cup of tea.
<cowvarkian> me too
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: Oh yeah, I remember hearing about that
<otakon> ValtheJean: -__________-
<Shizuka> 13silly otakun this is not cruel yet
<Petrified_Discord> We love u too ValtheJean
*Nittany_Discord 11,01scrubs ValtheJean
<otakon> Shizuka: it's getting there
<Kencolt> RAWRity: OK. Follow an emtertaining uplifting film with the greatest downer in history. Sound's legit... for Japan.
<Dken2021> RAWRity never knew that
<otakon> I need moar coffee
<SunderlandPony89> Trolling is fun, you can't deny that otakon
<Alister> I'm curel and I know iy
<Alister> it*
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: it's NOT fun
<cowvarkian> ikr Kencolt
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I'd prefer not to have to ban him, I like celestia radio personally, but people need to actually take notice of the channel rules when they join a chat
<Reikim> Kencolt: Which movie is this?
<Death> Moar MANGA
<Dken2021> how grim is grave of the fireflies?
*otakon wishes he was a mod sometimes
