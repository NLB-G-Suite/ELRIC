<Ascendant> nope

<RainBroDash> it is.
<RainBroDash> but this is also amazing dude
<RainBroDash> dat violin
<Dusky> Linux, not big suprise
<RainBroDash> just wait till it breaks down into metal
<Pegacorn> dat epic finger speed
<RainBroDash> you should see him impersonating herman li
<Pegacorn> dat metal
<RainBroDash> he takes the piss out of him on stage and does a violin herman li solo with a wah wah pedal
<prince-dari> HOLY SHIT. AWESOME. OH MY GOD.
<RainBroDash> fucking told you. dari you're me 2 years ago
<RainBroDash> it's like the rerapening all over again
<RainBroDash> (read that fic,it's funny shit)
<Pegacorn> ?
<prince-dari> I've got it open.
<RainBroDash> i've got a link here somewhere
<Espeon> 06Why am I not really surprised that the alignment test gave me true neutral? |D
<prince-dari> I didn't read it.
<RainBroDash> hahaha
<Pegacorn> ......what fic?
<RainBroDash> read it sometime
<prince-dari> No one walked in on my reading the other fics out loud.
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Which was good.
<RainBroDash> http://pastebin.com/n9fViXf0 - it's really nsfw of course
<RainBroDash> it's called the rerapening
<RainBroDash> also, google autocorrected me to 'reopening'
<Ray> 02LOL I got Neutral Evil
<RainBroDash> NOPE GOOGLE
<Ray> 02Should I fell guilty? XD
<RainBroDash> Dari, loving the pagan battle metal?
<Pegacorn> Does this smell like clorophorme to you?(lol Nash reference)
<prince-dari> This is SOOOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME.
<RainBroDash> told ya mayn
<prince-dari> Clop clop clop
<RainBroDash> now for a sick cover by them
<Dusky> Alignment test?
<Pegacorn> olololololol
<Espeon> 06This test is a proper one though and treats alignments how it should - not making "evil" equal to "stomping kittens" and "good" equal to "taking a bullet for ANYONE"
<prince-dari> MFW RBD makes me download music.
<Ascendant> blah
<Ascendant> Ray
<Ascendant> I got Chaotic Evil
<RainBroDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3gkit21XM
<Dusky> Oh, then i can guess mine
<RainBroDash> in this one he mocks herman li
<Ray> 02No one saw that one comming NS xD
<prince-dari> Harro
<Dusky> Devil >;D
<Ascendant> ):
<RainBroDash> oh no, this is after he mocks herman
<Espeon> 06When most people hear of chaotic evil they fail to realize that it can come from just being for pure freedom in a no-matter-what way lol
<prince-dari> Now tell all your friends, Harmon Ri is coo, or I shit on your head.
<Pegacorn> *chloroform
<Ascendant> Xeli
<Espeon> 06not being some kind of evil scientist
<Ascendant> the wording of the philosophies does make it sound surreal though
<Ascendant> and very unrealistic
<RainBroDash> anyway
<RainBroDash> epic song time
<RainBroDash> if you know the song
<RainBroDash> I love you so much
<Dusky> I wanna be a evil scienentist! With a cool beard, in a underground laberatory
<Espeon> 06lol
<Dusky> And work with lasers!
<Ascendant> honestly, by their wording, I'm more of a "Chaotic Good" or "Chaotic Neutral"
<Ascendant> rather than "Chaotic Evil"
<RainBroDash> "Now tell all your friends, Harmon Ri is coo, or I shit on your head." i love that video
<Ascendant> tbqh all of this good/evil stuff is flawed
<RainBroDash> RAAWRR
<Espeon> 06well isn't it always?
<Ascendant> duh :p
<RainBroDash> wait till the chorus if you don't know it, you might get it
<Espeon> 06unless people actually back it up I almost instantly look at their arguement in another light if they use the term "evil"
<RainBroDash> RA RA RASPUTIN
<Ascendant> imo good/evil doesn't really exist
<Espeon> 06SPOILER: Not in a better light!
<Ascendant> I made that clear in Reminiscence and TCTL lol
<prince-dari> No idea man.
<RainBroDash> FUCK DARI
<RainBroDash> FUCKS SAKE
<Pegacorn> I know this song.Just not the metal version.
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> if I had to define evil/good
<Ascendant> I'd say evil is just opposing how the world wants to be lol
<Ascendant> good is agreeing with society
<RainBroDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvDMlk3kSYg
<RainBroDash> that's the song
<RainBroDash> see pegacorn knows it
<RainBroDash> :<
<Pegacorn> Yeah.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Dusky> Depens on wich society...
<RainBroDash> so much better with violins and real guitar
<Ascendant> Which society do you think I mean? :p
<RainBroDash> and accordion
<Dusky> Those catholics?
<Dusky> *runs
<Espeon> 06and that is of course flawed too, those words just need to be kept out of anything but philosophy and ideologies almost xD
<Pegacorn> yea
<Espeon> 06and religion I guess but lol
<prince-dari> CoB Oops I did it again for the lulz.
<Ascendant> lol religion
<Dusky> ^
<Ascendant> I respect people who are part of a religion but I'm going to make it clear that I think it's stupid
<Dusky> I ate my birth candle
<Dusky> And i went natural
<Dusky> :D
<Ascendant> and yes, Xeli
<RainBroDash> >my best mate has played this every day I've been at his house
<Espeon> 06"Are you kidding me? The government can't even pave roads." I did like that one xD
<prince-dari> Lol. XD
<RainBroDash> that's 9 days in the last 14
<Pegacorn> ........I shall request something now.
<prince-dari> Ahahaha.
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZLJZY5jMXE

<Ascendant> I chose that one :p
<Pegacorn> play it after ok?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Ray> 02I HAD to pick it xD
<RainBroDash> anyway everypony, going away so i can get home
<prince-dari> Ok.
<RainBroDash> ill be back online when i get to my own house
<Ascendant> Honestly, it's similar to what I think
<prince-dari> MFW where's my iPod gone?
<Ray> 02^ also that
<RainBroDash> bjornfort's read end
<RainBroDash> rear
<RainBroDash> FUCK
<RainBroDash> SPELLING
<Dusky> Wait wait wait
<prince-dari> God damn it.
<Ascendant> I trust in very few and have faith in nothing
<Dusky> Does ascendant think!?
<RainBroDash> >bjornfoooooorrrrrrrrrt
<Ascendant> more than you do :p
<RainBroDash> baibai
<Espeon> 06It's totally true too
<Pegacorn> ?
<Dusky> Hey ascendant, i think.. Alot, but at the wrong moments i do
<Ascendant> out of everyone I know IRL I think there's only one person that I can say that I legitly trust
<Dusky> * runs
<Dusky> Drake?
<Ascendant> that person is the Hensh, and Drake doesn't count
<Espeon> 06lol
<Dusky> :P
<Ascendant> on the internet, the only people I completely trust are Xeli, Drake, Altair, Sneas, Shiny and Skylands
<Ray> 02lol
<Dusky> *hm
<Pegacorn> and,BAM.
<Dusky> Good list
<Pegacorn> AVENGED SEVENFOLD
<Ascendant> I've known nearly all of them for most of my internet life anyway :p
<Ascendant> except for Sneas, but he's behind but half a year
<prince-dari> A7x is win.
<Pegacorn> NIGHTMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARE!
<Dusky> I have a few too, going to meet 2 of them oo
<Ascendant> heh
<Pegacorn> IT'S YOUR FUCKIN' NIGHTMARE!
<Dusky> Ray and Patrick.c
<Dusky> :D
<Ascendant> it's hard to gain my trust
<Ray> 02^
<Dusky> ^^
<Ascendant> I usually say "Trust is a bridge that is easy to break but hard to build"
<Ray> 02But my funfact is: It's harder to gain my trust IRL .-.
<Espeon> 06I assume the best but if people screw up it takes a lot to get back on my good side
<Dusky> ^
<Ascendant> I'm more of a pessimist ;p
<Pegacorn> METALSHY
<Dusky> Or
<Espeon> 06Well then we're two, even though I always say I'm a realist more than anything.
<Dusky> Ffin keyboard >>
<Espeon> 06And people always go RRUH NO YOU'RE A PESSIMIST
<Espeon> 06It's like the people thinking that pansexuality = bisexuality lol
<Ascendant> yeah same, I'm more of a realist
<Ascendant> lolwut
<Dusky> Lol?
<Ascendant> and I'm a lot more blunt
<Espeon> 06YOU'RE OKAY WITH BOTH GENDERS? OK YOU'RE BI THEN
<Dusky> Morons and homophobes, they be!
<Dusky> I think....
<Espeon> 06I'd go into explaining the difference but it's not really needed xD
<Ascendant> and heh, I usually don't assume the best
<Ascendant> I can usually tell whether the person in question is an idiot or not
<Espeon> 06Well if I was like that you would never get to know me, so don't complain :)
*Espeon hides
<Ascendant> Very quickly, but I give it time :p
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Pegacorn> other request again.
<Pegacorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiCCWQWoknM
<Dusky> Hey ascendant, you mad? Now tell me if im a idiot or not xD
<Pegacorn> Guile theme with a fight scene wins.
<Ascendant> dear god the way I acted 3 years ago
<Espeon> 06When I say assume the best I do not mean I think everyone is a saint
<Pegacorn> play after ok?
<Ascendant> Dusky you're an idiot, a moron and a useless pile of words
<Ascendant> :)
<Dusky> :D
<Dusky> You forgot retard
<Dusky> ;D
<Espeon> 06I guess a more correct way to say it is that I assume nothing until otherwise is proven :P
<Ascendant> nah, that'd lessen the insult
<Pegacorn> Are you there prince-dari?
<Espeon> 06Read between the li- no that makes no sense
<Pegacorn> brb
<Ascendant> lmao
<Dusky> XD
<Espeon> 06But it's really amusing the things people think are insults and they throw around
<Pegacorn> ok i'm back
<Ascendant> lol I was kidding :p
<Ascendant> but seriously, people actually get offended by that
<Dusky> One sec, need to help at deck, going under a bridge
<Ascendant> I know people who have ragequit when I told them that lol
<Pegacorn> it's from the Cinema Snob's review of "Riki-Oh:The Story of Ricky".
<Espeon> 06I love playing games online with a friend of mine who's gay, he REALLY knows how to handle the children going YOU KILLED ME YOU'RE SO GAY RRUH

<Ascendant> lmfao
*Espeon also sits on Ascendant
<Espeon> 06Yeah
<Espeon> 06It inspired me

<Dusky> Back
<Ascendant> you've influenced me so much:p
<Dusky> And LOL
<Ascendant> +space
<Espeon> 06Even though I'm not gay, but it makes them shut up :P
<Ascendant> I remember wolfhome and "trolling" it
<Espeon> 06it trolls itself anyway
<Pegacorn> dat obvious stunt double
<Espeon> 06but yes

<Dman> that's the surprise?
<RunningPies> Orly
<prince-dari> There isn't one now.
<Pegacorn> But,the thing is,only I was actually Rainbow Dash in that game.
<prince-dari> It was ruined.
<Skylands> 10Rainbows
<RunningPies> I forgot about that
<Dman> : (
<RainBroDash1> 10Hack the Planet
<Dman> but all the ponies look like Rainbow Dash, Pegacorn
<Dman> profit
<Pegacorn> I think the guy on the cliff was Nanosuit 2.0,and the guy with the chicken is the default guy
<Pegacorn> The thing is,when i use a skin,every player becomes me.
<Pegacorn> But that pic was taken a while ago.I'm now Dr.Nefarious in Minecraft.
<Pegacorn> And i have a new texture pack too.The one in the pic is a "MGS:VR Training" inspired texture pack.
<Dman> oh, minecraft issues
<Dman> : [
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Kosovo
<Pegacorn> I now have "Coterie Craft" as a texture pack.The sun has sunglasses,the moon is Nyan Cat,the rain is skittles,among others.
<RunningPies> Come on that should have worked
<Kosoveon> hi
<Dman> 0_o haha
<Kosoveon> well this is interesting
<Kosoveon> apparently, nintendo is cutting the price of the 3DS down to $169 on August 12 O_O
<Pegacorn> Sun is all like:"Deal with it"
<Dman> Deal.
<Skylands> 10duhderp :P
<Kosoveon> and the people that bought it before that price cut are getting 20 free downloadable games, 10 of which aren't gonna be available for people who bought a 3DS after that dater
<Kosoveon> -r
<Kosoveon> that's pretty awesome if you ask me
<Pegacorn> I also have the "Last Days" texture pack,but i'm not using it right now.It's a "Fallout" inspired texture pack.

<Dman> @Funmeter Minecraft

<prince-dari> Oh dear.
<RunningPies> Okay I am sorry for all that connecting and disconnecting, I'll stop now

<Dman> prince-dari uh ... um ...
<Pegacorn> Klunk is really hard in Secret Agent Clank.
<Pegacorn> I mean,Battletoads level hard.
<Dman> haven't played that game

<Dman> i know i can go more
<Dman> it was when i flew from amercia to portugal to england
<Dman> and 'slept' in portugal overnight
<prince-dari> Little sleep + boredom = I decide things that I'd normally think are crazy are fun and perfectly safe.
<Dman> 'slept' here meaning 'played phoenix wright all night'
<prince-dari> Ah, very long flight?
<Dman> Price-dari sounds about right!
<Dman> And then the REM hallucinations kick in!
<Dman> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Ray

<drfsupercenter> 03I have this adapter that goes in the casette tape slot and you can plug a mp3 player into it
<drfsupercenter> 03it's how I use my Zune in my car, since it's old and doesn't have an aux input
<drfsupercenter> 03but the adapter broke so it's only using the right channel

<Barry> I thought the largest was giga-byte
<Dashite> Nope
<Dashite> 2GB drives aren't too bad. Tend to be more for storage not speed though.
<prince-dari> I wonder how long it takes for me to fill up 3TB of pony.
<Dashite> Also, Dari, you keep your porn in the cloud.

<RainBroDash1> 10the rainbow is made up of all the secondary colours, but one tertiary was added to appease the church
<RainBroDash1> 10TECHNICALLY there are near infinite colours in the rainbow if you want to be pedantic
<RainBroDash1> 10but the classical rainbow should have 6 colours not 7
<Barry> Actually, the rainbow is made up of the three primary and three secondary colors
<RainBroDash1> 10except, lolchristianity ruining things again
<RainBroDash1> 10yeah yeah, i meant it doesn't extend -past- secondary colours :3 ofc the primaries are in there too >.>
<Barry> Red Blue and Yellow are the primary, orange green and violet are secondary
<RainBroDash1> 10yarp, and indigo is just green-violet. like orange is red-yellow
<RainBroDash1> 10so really the rainbow has yellow-green, and yellow-yellow-green, and yellow-yellow-yellow-green in it too, but that's just pointless
<Dashite> 0,14:7p
<Barry> Did you notice that the way the colors are set up, each primary is separated by a secondary?
<Dashite> 0,14I7n8t3e9r11e4s7t8i3n9g11. 4C7o8l3o9u11r 4t7e8x3t 9i11n4t7e8r3f9e11r4s 7w8i3t9h 11e4m7o8t3i9c11o4n7s8.
<Barry> Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
<RainBroDash1> 10that's because the secondaries are made from mixing two primaries D: they form on the border between two primaries
<RainBroDash1> 10or rather, they have a wavelength between the midpoints of the two primaries
<Barry> ah
<RainBroDash1> 10and thus refract less or more than the primary, so are above/below in a rainbow
<RainBroDash1> 10and that's how equestria was made.
<Barry> Oh, dashite, interfer isn't a word.
<Barry> the red wavy line means it's a typo
<Barry> you were missing an "e"

<Barry> ah
<RDash> Oh, I have an announcement!
<prince-dari> ?
<RDash> On June 26, I emailed the Cheezburger Customer Service for memebase and ICHC. I asked them to consider adding a brony section to memebase. I listed a few reasons, but expected no reply. They gave me a case number a day later, but I still did not expect much. A few days later, to my surprise I received a nice response from Chelsea, Katrina, and Emily
<RDash> (the rep team) saying how great it was that I was trying to improve the website and they said that they would pass the idea on. I figured that would be the last I would hear of it and went away on vacation for three weeks O.O.
<RDash> Since I came back I’ve barely checked memebase, but yesterday I noticed a new section for bronies. I checked the day of the first post and realized that it was July 1st. I think that the date stamp is wrong as the first reply to the picture is July 21, which would also explain why I had not noticed the new section before. Coincidence? Maybe. Awesome? Yes
<prince-dari> O___o Wow.
<SoiPony> that's pretty cool
<RainBroDash1> 10mfw I'm not really that bothered about sites like that, but grats getting something done that could lead to more exposure :3
<RDash> Yeah! I used to check it more, but I've weaned off since ponies
<SoiPony> especially after memebase banned ponies for a few weeks
<RDash> Yeah, I noticed that
<SoiPony> then we got our own section out of nowhere
<prince-dari> MFW I hear a song on TV that I've seen before in a PMV and my mind whiplashes back to ponies
<RDash> Some people were getting really mad
<SoiPony> lol

<RDash> That was mean. Someone posted the doors to equestria, but didn't give us a date!

<SoiPony> lol
<SoiPony> Russet just tweeted a pic from inside the doors
<SoiPony> can't see anything though lol
<junh1024-XD> oh lol sibelius 7 is outr
<Dashite> Yup. I saw the guy who made the original post with that picture before it went up on EqD.
<RDash> The monitors are too bright to see what's on them!
<SoiPony> eeeyep
<RDash> That office looks like it needs more ponies
<SoiPony> it's too epic for a single camera to capture :p
<RDash> I hope that it live up to our expectations! Especially since the people working on it have set our expectations..
<SoiPony> according to the person tht took the pic of the doors, S2 is living up to the hype
<SoiPony> and I'd believe it
<RDash> Yeah, I read that
<SoiPony> they have a great formula already
<SoiPony> they know what's working and what we like
<RDash> Yep, they have a huge foundation to make it a great show
<SoiPony> more Luna, just sayin
<RDash> I don't think that Hasbro is too involved which is a good thing
<Espeon> 06:3
<RDash> Gives the writers more creative space
<SoiPony> my face when pony socks become canon in S2

<Persian> Various metalic objects.
<Barry> But no matter what, they will keep some pony features
<Barry> if not all
<Dashite> Just waiting for Twilight and Dusk to meet now.

<SoiPony> yeah
<SoiPony> so epic
<Light_Latias> 12back
<Barry> Though I make no guarantees, since Termina's Last Twilight has a Link that can talk
<Barry> though he doesn't do it often
<Dman> eh i'll just read it then :P
<SoiPony> ah
<SoiPony> have him speak
<SoiPony> with SIGN LANGUAGE
<SoiPony> problem solved
<Dman> HAHAHA
<Dman> that would be amazing!
<Dman> make link mute
<Barry> lol
<Dman> so he has to communicate through acting and noises by banging stuff together etc
<Barry> But he's not mute in Wind Waker
<Dman> it's an idea
<Dman> Yea, i know
<Dman> but thats the point
<Barry> He said C'mon
<Kosoveon> wb
<Barry> says*
<Dman> to make it lol / tru to game, make him not say like anything much
<SoiPony> yeah
<Dman> maybe a word or 2 :P
<RobotPinkie> Well he can say "HYAH"
<RobotPinkie> and "WAAAA"
<SoiPony> yeahp
<Barry> like C'mon when beckoning the stone statues
<RobotPinkie> Not the most eloquent protagonist I've seen, exactly.
<Dman> i remember that barry, it was very :3
<SoiPony> lol
<Barry> This makes me wonder how much Link will speak in Skyward Sword
<SoiPony> Gordan Freeman is
<RobotPinkie> Oh that's true, I forgot about the "c'mon"
<Dman> hopefully nm, barry
<Dman> :3
<RobotPinkie> I want him to speak through a hand puppet
<SoiPony> mfw Link is voiced by morgan freeman in skyward sword
<SoiPony> just because
<RobotPinkie> Pinkamena style
<Barry> what? I thought it was always a Japanese guy who voiced Link
<Link> ...
<SoiPony> lol, that would be funny
<Link> Who nickalerted me
<Novi> meh obv
<SoiPony> morgan doing the usual link grunts and yells

<HyperMetalLugia> Well, you could just run your laptop off of the car port :P
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03why wouldn't they just put the spares in a bag then
<drf|laptop> 03and keep them in the glove box
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<drf|laptop> 03seems silly to actually label them and have little metal terminals for unused fuses o.o
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Zoroark> because there's less chance of you losing them if they're already in there
<drf|laptop> 03LOL another disclaimer saying not to swallow gasoline

<Typhlosion> People are better than people give credit, but the bad ones pull humanity down.
<Typhlosion> I'm sure that most people wouldn't drink gasoline, but it's the worst who would, and they're given protection because they can't be liable because they don't know better.
<Light_Latias> 12tho if one of us "better people" does something wrong, the law pulls up that "ignorance is no excuse" :3
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Typhlosion> because it's generally stated somewhere not to do those things because someone before you has done one of those things.

<RDash> "All's quiet on the western front"
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, nickstr, turns out my 11 year old SUV actually has RDS capabilities
<drf|laptop> 03I just turned it on on my drive home and it was very primitively showing what song was playing on any given station XD
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<Light_Latias> 12wbs Danny
<drf|laptop> 03RDS =Radio Data system
<drf|laptop> 03as in
<nickstr> yep
<drf|laptop> 03there's data going through the air whether you want it to or not >:O
<nickstr> many car radios have that
<drf|laptop> 03well mine's from 2000
<nickstr> even factory ones
<drf|laptop> 03and I totally didn't realize it
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, this is a factory one
<nickstr> its by no means a recent thing at all
<RainBroDash2> *lol'd more than i should have*
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<nickstr> quite a discovery huh
<drf|laptop> 03I'm surprised that it still works
<drf|laptop> 03like
<drf|laptop> 03you'd think with all the new radios, 11 year old single-line LCD displays wouldn't be able to properly parse the data
<drf|laptop> 03it works though, just kinda annoyingly as it's usually one word per line
<drf|laptop> 03due to... the thing being LCD
<drf|laptop> 03as in, what a clock uses
<nickstr> it seems for car radios you could either have AM stereo or RDS in factory units
<nickstr> not both
<SoiPony> lol
<SilverMane> WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY
<SilverMane> GAh
<drf|laptop> 03AM doesn't have RDS, does it?
<drf|laptop> 03at least in the car I have it didn't show anyhting
<drf|laptop> 03*anything
<Sonic> lol
<nickstr> actually yes it does
<Sonic> i cant help it
<nickstr> but its called AMSS
<Link> :P
<drf|laptop> 03is it standards complaint though?
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03*compliant
<nickstr> for Amplitude Modulation Signaling System
<drf|laptop> 03not complaint XD
<nickstr> yes it is
<drf|laptop> 03well not with "RDS"
<nickstr> nope
<nickstr> totally different than RDS
<nickstr> and not used much
<drf|laptop> 03well either way my car doesn't support it
<drf|laptop> 03my car's AM radio sucks though
<nickstr> which is a given
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, the large antenna that sticks up where the hood is is only for FM, right? I think AM needs a loop antenna?
<nickstr> its used for both AM and FM
<drf|laptop> 03granted, my mom's minivan has the antenna built into the back window, and it has such crappy receptionm
<drf|laptop> 03I prefer my 2000 SUV where the antenna's like 3 feet long and sticks up XD
<nickstr> I hate that design
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03it's more sleek but the reception SUCKS
<nickstr> those glazed in glass antennas suck BIG TIME

<drf|laptop> 03even on very strong radio stations like we have in Detroit
<drf|laptop> 03it was turning to static every few feet when I was going slowly
<nickstr> speaking of Detroit radio stations
<nickstr> yep I can get WJR
<nickstr> I was trying for them
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<nickstr> there was a recording of WJR 760 in stereo from a Delco UX-1 AM stereo/FM stereo car radio online but its disappeared
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03would I need entirely new stereo equipment in my car or could I just get one of those ones that costs like $100, take out the old one and plug the new one into where that was?
<nickstr> you can get a new car stereo
<nickstr> but you need a wiring harness to connect it to your factory wiring
<drf|laptop> 03hm?
<nickstr> for after market car stereos
<drf|laptop> 03what do you mean by wiring harnes
<drf|laptop> 03s
<nickstr> these plugs that connect to the stereo
<drf|laptop> 03well isn't the only plugs like the speakers, and then the steering wheel controls?
<drf|laptop> 03plus power I guess
<nickstr> something like that
<drf|laptop> 03so then why do you need a harness?
<drf|laptop> 03can't you just plug thoes wires into the new ones?
<nickstr> sort of an adapter to hook up after market car stereos
<drf|laptop> 03got a picture of one?
<nickstr> not off hand
<drf|laptop> 03well how much are car stereos that do AM stereo and RDS and all that stuff?
<nickstr> they are factory equipped only
<nickstr> mine I got for just $1
<drf|laptop> 03factory equipped only?
<nickstr> it means installed at the factory
<drf|laptop> 03they don't make aftermarket ones that hav eit?
<nickstr> not AM stereo
<drf|laptop> 03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ctps.png?w=500&h=190
<nickstr> but RDS, yes
<drf|laptop> 03well duh, mine is factory default and it has RDS
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03how new are the AM stereo ones?
<nickstr> early 2000s are the newest ones
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<nickstr> the one I have is from August 1990
<drf|laptop> 03would that be too old to have an AUX input to plug a 1/8" headphone plug into? :/
<nickstr> yes
<drf|laptop> 03darn it
<drf|laptop> 03forget that then
<drf|laptop> 03I never listen to AM anyway

<Freyskol> then woodcutting
<SoiPony> D: b-b-but daddy
<Ghosties> 4So, Rainbow_Dash, how does it feel being loved by humans everywhere?
<ClockworkPie> and being stalked?
<Elision> how does this gaymeter work
<Freyskol> then all my other skills started to rise
<Barry> @gaymeter Gilda
<Rainbow_Dash> It's only natural. I mean, you can't be this awesome and not have everyone like you.
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Gilda is 96% gay. (484)
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, and stalked
<Freyskol> it takes time, questing is invaluble too
<Polarfire> hey dari, did you sleep?
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Ghosties> 4Really? I'm surprised you're not at least somewhat disgusted by it
<Rainbow_Dash> The stalkers are a little creepy though.
<SoiPony> my daddy is so cool :D
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<prince-dari> Yay.
<Polarfire> : D
<Glacymr> 12i guess swiftkit doesn't say your combat level anymore
<Polarfire> how long?
<Barry> And shipping you with just about everything
*Freyskol shrugs.
<Elision> you should ask silvermane about what he just wrote about you
<Glacymr> 12and my combat skills
<Freyskol> I never used SK
<Rainbow_Dash> And that stuff needs to stop.
<Glacymr> 12the only combat skill i have in the highscores is strength
<Glacymr> 12which is 80
<ClockworkPie> soooo.....kinky pie?
<Freyskol> lol
<Rainbow_Dash> I mean really, a cloud? What the hay?!
<SoiPony> lol
<Freyskol> I have near 80 in all combat skills
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, that too. Have you heard Renard's "Rainbow Dash Likes Girls" song?
<Polarfire> nah
<Freyskol> save summoning
<Polarfire> not yet
<Freyskol> but summoning requires mugo money
<SoiPony> that's old
<Glacymr> 12i only have 7 skills in hiscores
<Elision> that's one of like eight songs by him I like incidentally
<ClockworkPie> ;_;
<Ghosties> 4Hey, I still like that song though
<Freyskol> You'll like dungeoneering btw
<Rainbow_Dash> SilverMane wrote something about me? O.o I'm not sure what to think about that yet...
<Barry> That's better than Pinkie. I heard she was shipped with a battleship once
<SoiPony> true, it is good
<Ghosties> 4Even if I don't listen to it nearly as much as I did.
<Rainbow_Dash> I haven't heard that song yet.
<Glacymr> 12i have a friend who is still obsessed with runescape
<Glacymr> 12he has like 80 dungeoneering
<prince-dari> Polarfire: Not even sure.
<Freyskol> lol
<Ghosties> 4Truth be told, I think I'm beginning to fade from the FiM love
<Freyskol> Dungeoneering goes up to level 126 :|
<Polarfire> D:
<Polarfire> wut ghosties
<SoiPony> D:
<prince-dari> Welp, hard drive transfer is finished.
<Barry> The first season is good, but it gets old
<Elision> prepare for ear murder http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcjso2HmQqo
<Freyskol> That's near 200b exp
<Freyskol> or was that 200m exp
<Barry> and Either ear murder or ear worms
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Ghosties> 4Well, I mean, when you don't have new eps every Friday, it's hard to continue wanting to love the show
<Ghosties> 4And Elision, I still like that song
<Elision> I do too Ghosties
<ClockworkPie> thats harsh Ghosties
<SoiPony> that's what fan fiction and art are for
<Elision> but it is kind of ear rapey
<SoiPony> and music
<Ghosties> 4Hmm, that came out wrong
<Ghosties> 4I still love the show...I think I'm losing interest
*SoiPony slaps ghosties
<ClockworkPie> oh well thats different
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I think that's a more accurate way to put it
<prince-dari> WUT!
<Barry> Having to wait until late fall early winter kind of kills your enthusiasm
<Rainbow_Dash> What the hay is this?!
<Glacymr> 12i know
<prince-dari> 561 new messages in BMN Skype chat?
<Ghosties> 4>_O NIGGER, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO?!
<prince-dari> YOU SERIOUS GUYS?
<prince-dari> YOU SERIOUS?
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> >_>
<SoiPony> lool
*Polarfire slaps ghosties around a bit with a large trout.
<Glacymr> 12either way frey
<Glacymr> 12it's unbarable
<Freyskol> yeah lol
<RDash> prince-dari Hey! I guessed right, it was a hard drive
<Glacymr> 12it still irritates me that the halfway point is like 92
<Freyskol> Yep
<Glacymr> 12for experience in the usual 99 skills
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Ghosties> 4And *YOU* SoiPony, I dare you to do it again
<Barry> That could be turned into a case of acciddental innuendo
<Elision> oh man listening to this with my good headphones is awesome
<Freyskol> 13.5 million exp
<SoiPony> :)
<SoiPony> no
<Freyskol> is 99
<SoiPony> I'm not getting banned
<SoiPony> again
<Ghosties> 4Hmph, that's what I thought...
*Dashite slaps Ghosties around a bit with a large trout
<ClockworkPie> can I slap you :3
<SoiPony> >: D
<Elision> Ghosties: yeah I'm gonna run out of fan steam before too too long
<Freyskol> But think about what you're killing at level 92 vs level 1.
<RDash> Ghosties WHAT?! losing. Interest?!?
<Freyskol> It'll go by a lot faster.
<Elision> but then it'll return and keep my interest again I expect
<RDash> *:O*
<Glacymr> 12i can't kill anything special
<Rainbow_Dash> Why are you guys hitting each other with fish? O.o
<Elision> besides bronydom is based on fan content rather than the show really
<Ghosties> 4ClockworkPie, I'd be most appreciative if you'd refrain from slapping me. That's a bad route to go
<Barry> I have all 26 MLP: FiM episodes recorded, but I haven't watched them in forever
<Glacymr> 12heck
<Ghosties> 4And yes, RDash, losing interest
<ClockworkPie> kay :D
<Glacymr> 12i'm too afraid to even go into the wilderness
<Freyskol> Odds are you won't kill anything special until you're in the 90s :P
<Freyskol> I still struggle
<Freyskol> Widly is pvp now

<Glacymr> 12i went in there all the time when it wasn't pvp anymore
<Glacymr> 12because i loved to explore
<Ghosties> 4Oh boy, what frontiers has the most degraded individuals of the Brony Movie Night spawned?
<SoiPony> D:
<Ghosties> 4*inhales*
<Barry> I don't hear anything
<Glacymr> 12and the only risk then was those dumb monsters that they made spawn magically out there
<prince-dari> Oh God, not the RP room.
<prince-dari> You don't even want to know what happens there Ghosties.

<FlutterHi> hey guys
<SilverSonic> also my wii is still on Sonic 4 at E.G.G. Station Zone
<SilverSonic> XD
<FlutterHi> Whaddup!
<prince-dari> When we get the 300 or so people from BMN that's something like 10 times as many people are as normally on.
<Polarfire> wow.
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Polarfire> I didn't realize that.
<Polarfire> how long has epic-chat been around?
<prince-dari> Not sure of the date it started many years ago though.
<FlutterHi> so what time is it by you?
<Polarfire> ah.
<Polarfire> ohai flutterhi
<prince-dari> If you check /list even now #bronystate is still the biggest channel.
<prince-dari> With just 14 users.
<prince-dari> 6:48 am
<Dashie> hey guys
<prince-dari> Hey.
*Glacymr gives SilverSonic some strawberry milk

<Dashie> im very new to here. how is this brony movie night?
<Polarfire> wow.
<Dashie> any good?
<prince-dari> Movie night hasn't started yet. :P
<Dashie> i know im asking how the whole thing is. in general.
<prince-dari> It's great, though on Friday stream we usually have up to 300 people.
<prince-dari> So the chat can be a bit fast.
<FlutterHi> pretty good :) I mean full of awesome bronies
<Polarfire> chat is impossible.
<Dashie> oh damn.
<prince-dari> Some people prefer the Saturday stream which has more like 50-100 people.
<Polarfire> Its a blast, but as far as talking...
<Dashie> Id love to buy popcorn and chat with some people while watching mlp.
<prince-dari> As it's easier to talk.
<Polarfire> nope :P
<Barry> Knock knock
<Dashie> its friday here now ;P
<prince-dari> Who's there?
<Barry> Interrupting cow
<prince-dari> Interrupting cow who?
<FlutterHi> sure.. I'll take the free popcorn
<Barry> It doesn't work right here
<prince-dari> But the first film isn't for another 17 hours I think.
<Barry> The interrupting meme thing won't work right here
<prince-dari> Though we usually have a prestream before that.
<Dashie> question? Im extremely bored and wanted to meet up with a brony.
<Dashie> Is there any brony meetups anywhere?
<Dashie> or some site i could meetup with bronies..
<prince-dari> I dunno, where do you live?
<prince-dari> US?
<Dashie> all my freinds seem... not to like ponies.
<Dashie> Australia! D::::
<Polarfire> check equestria daily.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Polarfire> oh.
<FlutterHi> well I'd love to meet up w/ u
<prince-dari> I've not seen Australia meets, though there is a map somewhere.
<FlutterHi> but australia is an ocean away for me
<prince-dari> Where you can put your location.
<Dashie> :(
<prince-dari> And see if any other bronies have put their location near yours.
<Dashie> i have met a group of bronies before but they were unmagic
<prince-dari> Unfortunately I don't remember where this is.
<Dashie> half of them didnt watch the show.
<Dashie> and they were sadness.
<prince-dari> So...How were they bronies?
<Barry> Knock knock
<Dashie> the freindship... was unmagic...
<prince-dari> Who's there?
<Barry> Banana
<prince-dari> Banana who?
<Barry> Knock knock
<prince-dari> Wut
<Barry> It's the joke
<Glacymr> 12i'm sure no one here is interested in even looking at my tcg review XD
<Polarfire> omygod
<Polarfire> uuuugh
<prince-dari> MFW I don't understand your joke?
<Polarfire> dari its a stupid US thing.
<prince-dari> Ohh.
<Barry> When someone answers Who's there with Banana, you can expect them to0 continue the knock knock joke with the same words ad i9nfinitum
<Polarfire> It's joke-ception.
<Barry> infinitum*
<Dashie> My freind seems to think Giggle at the ghosty sounds like....
<prince-dari> What's "Banana".
<Dashie> giggle at the...
<Dashie> Goatse..
<Barry> until they say Orange
<Barry> So it could literally go on forever
<Dashite> Crack up at the creepy. Yeah, it all fits Dashie.

<Polarfire> dare I even ask?
<Light_Latias> 12o u
<prince-dari> Do I really want to know?
<SilverSonic> I need MOTIVATION .-.
<Barry> I don't know either, but I wouldn't want to meet it

<FlutterHi> how does it differ from a regular conga
<Dashite> 1) Dig a hole. 2) Place peanuts in hole. 3) Cover peanuts with ashes. 4) Wait for elephant. 5) Kick the elephant in the ash-hole. 6) *groan*
<prince-dari> This time I don't even need to ask.
<prince-dari> I know I don't want to nkow.
<prince-dari> know*
<Barry> It's when you experience a series pf humiliating events
<Polarfire> no...
<Barry> of*
<FlutterHi> I like Dashite's explanation better
<FlutterHi> so that just became my reality
<Polarfire> Dashite: damn.
<Barry> I guess it's kind of hard to set one of those up
<Polarfire> I just gotta say. Damn.

<Barry> Why Pinkie pie paused for so long
<Polarfire> I was hooked on that little clip.

<FlutterHi> I can't remember where I placed my sanity
<Polarfire> I know I found it on 4chan (the ONLY good thing 4chan has ever done for me)
<Polarfire> and I thought wtfits
<Polarfire> I didn't even realize it was a show, or that it had a following.
<Polarfire> So I clicked on the thread...
<FlutterHi> originally I thought it was part of an elaborate 4chan troll
<Polarfire> and it was all rule 34 -.-
<prince-dari> MFW 4chan >_>
<prince-dari> MFW I've never been

<Polarfire> or was it?
<Polarfire> oh that one XD
<Polarfire> sure go ahead
<Polarfire> link to follow along?
<Polarfire> :3
<Polarfire> oh shoot
<Zoroark> >mfw there's a forum that i haven't been to in literally years
<Polarfire> I just realized I never read past the beginning on this one D:
<Dragoran> o-o
<Dragoran> uh what do you mean, Umbreon?
<Zoroark> well maybe not plural but still
<Umbreon> 12oh nothing
<Umbreon> 12i can figure it out myself
<Dragoran> ._.
<Polarfire> noooo don't do it D:
<Dragoran> I'm not too strict on anything
<Zoroark> make up rules as you go, best admin ever :3
*Zoroark run
<Dragoran> lmao
<Dragoran> I do that here
<Umbreon> 12well
<Umbreon> 12if i make a tcg article
<Umbreon> 12i would like to reference other tcg communities
<Umbreon> 12but i don't want to be ban hammered for advertising lol
<Zoroark> eh, at least it isn't like my minecraft adminning, where everyone can do whatever the fuck they want, oh and everyone has op too
<Zoroark> then again it was a community server for a fairly close-knit community
<Zoroark> this one guy though i swear
<Zoroark> he just obtained TNT asap if he got op
<Zoroark> which is why he didn't get op
<Polarfire> Noooo D:
<Zoroark> but yeah that server kinda died
<Zoroark> not for lack of interest but lack of updating on the hosting service's part
<Polarfire> dat context
<Polarfire> D:
<Polarfire> filly rape is terrble
<Polarfire> Gah
<Polarfire> Is anybody still here?
<Barry> here
<Dragoran> Umbreon you think I'm a moderator ):
<Umbreon> 12no
<Dragoran> there's no rule against that lol
<Umbreon> 12i think you are an admin
<Dragoran> lol Zoroark
<Polarfire> well... down to 3.
<Polarfire> XD
<Umbreon> 12which was why i opened up the convo with that question
<Umbreon> 12instead of cutting right to the cheese
<Polarfire> dari?
<Polarfire> yeah pretty long...
<Polarfire> and yup.
<Polarfire> you.
<Link> ;o
<Polarfire> :3
<Polarfire> hmm.... I don't remember anything from last night's caffeine edition.
<Polarfire> link?
<PTS> Zoroark: Add kick on TNT placement
<PTS> That's what we did
<PTS> Unless u are an admin or have permissions
<Polarfire> what?
<Polarfire> what is it?
<Polarfire> what???
<Polarfire> speak man!
<Polarfire> SPEAK
<Dragoran> ah
<Polarfire> hmm...
<Polarfire> what do you suspect dari?
<Polarfire> well I have my suspicions...
<prince-dari> By Razyn
<Zoroark> PTS, it was a vanilla server
<PTS> Fail
<Polarfire> who's that?
<Zoroark> nop
<PTS> Bukkit yo
<Zoroark> I still like vanilla servers, but I guess now I'm kind of used to at least essentials.
<Zoroark> I'd like to make a vanilla survival server sometime though.
<PTS> Our server Is anarchy atm
<PTS> Sniper wants survival, though
<PTS> Doubt it'll happen
<Zoroark> difference == ???
<PTS> Like people spawn at will and do crazy stuff
<PTS> No real rules for building
<Polarfire> lol dari...
<Polarfire> XD
<Polarfire> wtfits
<Polarfire> THE END
<Polarfire> that was pretty messed up.
<Polarfire> thanks for reading me a story, I guess.
<Polarfire> XD
<Polarfire> anybody still here?
<Zoroark> ah, okay. I've seen servers use "anarchy" in a way that is really just basically "survival"
<Polarfire> hmm. nope I guess.

<Pegacorn> ohai prince-dari
<RobotPinkie> so should I go buy all the mane 6 at the local toy store this weekend, or should i risk them running out?

<prince-dari> Meh, probably 20 minutes or so.
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<Creideiki> I've discovered that: 1. The quad-processor PDP-11/74 is a massive pain. 2. The only thing that takes advantage of having four CPUs is RSX-11/M+, and only then all you get is RMS-11 not having to wait for CPU time. 3. having what amounts to five peripheral buses is a MASSIVE PITA.
<interior_gummy> eh, i'm still in the closed on my brony-ness
<prince-dari> >random people I don't know run the store
<prince-dari> >could not give less of a damn what they think

<RobotPinkie> lolol I had to come out as a brony, my mom sews dresses for dolls and I needed some pointers
<Pegacorn> ACCEPT YOUR BRONY-NESS INTERIOR_GUMMY!
<interior_gummy> i accept it, but i have yet to tell people in irl
<RobotPinkie> pointers have yet to be delivered >_>
<Creideiki> Oh, and 4. MASSBUS disks are dual-ported, RMS loves disks; you can never access your disks when you want to because RMS is consuming all the disk time on Port B, while the monitor is going "I WANT DISK" on Port A.
<Pegacorn> TELL THEM NOW!
<RobotPinkie> also laughs were had at my expense, but I don't give a shit

<Creideiki> Oh, and of course dual-ported: Two CPUs out of four can see the disk. So if you're logged in on CPD, and the disks are attached to CPA and CPB, and you request the disk.. you have to wait for RMS on CPB to finish screwing around, and then wait for CPA to finish... whatever its doing to read the disk, cram the data into memory and let CPD do the work...
<interior_gummy> i was just reading the fim article on tv tropes, and evidently "losers" was censored in canad
<interior_gummy> *canada
<Pegacorn> why?

*HyperMetalLugia just laughs at all the crazy computing and technical talk
<RainBroDash> @dari true that. it's like 20 quid with shipping
<RobotPinkie> it's a site where people analyze TV tropes...
<prince-dari> Eeyup

<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds impossible to use :P

<RainBroDash> also. dari you not gone yet?
<RobotPinkie> oh god, never again will I be able to watch a movie with my girlfriend... she constantly comments on plot holes
<Pegacorn> I wonder if leverage has leverage over plot holes and leverage.
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari: i can get a brushable RD toy for $5

<RainBroDash> Dari: MLG is the 'Major League Gaming circuit' where they have gaming competitions bringing the world's best gaming teams together against each other, primarily in black ops, halo reach and starcraft 2

<RobotPinkie> my Pinkie Pie has a tiny piece of glitter in one nostril. life irrevocably destroyed.
<interior_gummy> i've honestly never seen the toys
<Dman> 0haha
<RobotPinkie> lol actually it'll be fine after I pour boiling water on her head
*Aristeo hugs Sally and Skah
<Dman> 0you hairstyling? :3
<Aristeo> Calculus is hard x.x
<Dman> 0only reason i want bwushables
<interior_gummy> pinkie will be fine, she can't feel pain
<RobotPinkie> that's the plan, yup
<Dman> 0too much sugar in her blood :P
<RobotPinkie> she's made from bubblegum, you can't explain that
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would rather have a regular toy than a brushable tbh
<RobotPinkie> aw, but hairstyling :3
<interior_gummy> the regular toys are the brushables, because hasbro seems to think that mlp is a show for little girls or something
<Hipster_Brony> 8i mean regular as in non-brushable
<RobotPinkie> kinda want both, but i'd rather make dresses for brushables.
<Dman> 0but you can't condishun and comb normal ones :3
<Dman> 0heck im getting some fo both
<Dman> 0but mainly i waht the bwushies and a blindbak RBD to be in my pocket at all times
<Dman> 0that's the basic plan
<Sathi> 7D wake up :p
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont really want to brush them all that much though
<Hipster_Brony> 8they would probably just get all tangled and shit
<Dman> 0b'ah ah'm taired, sugarcube
<Dman> 0hipster_brony now u know what most girls feel like xP
<RainBroDash> I really want a plastic rbd for my desk, or my 'me shrine'
<Dman> 0if too much hair, gotta keep it well
<Dman> 0lol rainbrodash
<RobotPinkie> Want the fully molded ones on top of my TV in a neat row. :3
<Dman> 0i want one in my pocket so when i'm outta breath i reach in and grab RBD and go 'what would she do' and then sprint off again! Had this dream for a wile now :3
<Apokalipse> I don't want any of the toys. IMO toy made for cartoons always look bad
<RainBroDash> also: dman. >MFW I've been thinking for about an hour straight about how dishevelled my hair is today :3
<RobotPinkie> They kinda failed on the Fluttershy though, it looks like :(
<Dman> 0lul had shower yet?
<RainBroDash> yeah, after my shower :<
<RainBroDash> my hair's getting long. I'm thinking about cutting it
<Dman> 0after shower?
<Dman> 0y u no shape it when wet?
<RainBroDash> i did!
<RainBroDash> But it went crazy
<RainBroDash> when it dried
<Apokalipse> I usually take a shower before bed... and I have the most awesome haircut in the morning
<Hipster_Brony> 8im not sure a brushable is worth the trip to the pink aisle though
<RobotPinkie> naturally curly hair?
<RainBroDash> I don't have curly hair really no
<RainBroDash> I'd call it straight hair
<Dman> 0rainbrodash u no doin it rite :P
<RainBroDash> but it goes crazy at the ends when it gets longer
<Dman> 0hipster_brony you so wrong silly :P
<RobotPinkie> Oh it's worth it, especially if they don't even ask if you want it wrapped.

<May> 14K, I'm going with that then
<RainBroDash> I've not cut my hair since then (also: lost a stone and a half since then (H) )
<RainBroDash> or no, that was after I started losing weight
<RobotPinkie> lol that's pretty much the length of my hair right now. Time for a haircut this month, though.
<Dman> 0losing weight? you don't look fat there...?
<RainBroDash> >implying I would link you a photo where I looked fat

<RainBroDash> probably like 12 and a half
<Dman> 0oh i see

<Dman> 0i want to do this with RBD toy in pockit
<RobotPinkie> parkour? :P
<RainBroDash> If I can lose weight by eating right, I'm doing it right.
<RobotPinkie> yeah, that's usually how it is
<Dman> 0rainbrodash
<Dman> 0it's like 20% eating 80% work
<Dman> 0unless you diet/starve
<Dman> 0inwhich case its 40/60
<RainBroDash> I've been dieting. But dieting is really subjective to be fair
<Pattyrick> Ask Ascendant for more details
<RainBroDash> I used to eat like 2-3people's worth of food. Now I don't :P
<RobotPinkie> Exercising in any way becomes much harder if you don't change what you eat, or at least that's how it's been with me.
<Dusky> Pats
<Dusky> :3
<RobotPinkie> Dieting is a bad idea though.
<Pattyrick> Hey

<drf|away> 03right, I'm going now, but you iPad fans kindly go die in a fire kthx
<Pattyrick> (but iPad and iPod work fine with it :P)
<RainBroDash> I stumbled upon ponies a couple weeks into my most recent 'exceptionally happy' phase, so I don't think they're related, but my acceptance of ponies came about through my non-caring OH LOOK I'M FUCKING AWESOME attitude I've had for the last few months
<Dman> 0nice
<Pattyrick> Ok, whatever drf
<Dusky> Alice routers suck anyways pats, go eminent!
