<Kencolt> Cata made things easier, Buytoast -- but it still was a cookie cutter thing. I REALLY like what they did for MoP-- the nwe Talents are useful, but not given to (yet) a "YOU NOOB" if you haven't hit a theorycrafter.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lyra`: Oooooo
<Polydunami> Well, I like it, but you'd have to develop your own opinion on it, MadSurge
<Polydunami> One thing, however; try the visual novel.
<MadSurge> Polydunami: why? does it come before the anime?
<Polydunami> No, the anime is based off the novel
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Personal Second Perspective...also known as the PSP :)

<Lil_B> LOL! I just saw a Micky Mouse Cardboard Cutout in a Shop in a Scene of a Movie made in 1931... I don't know why but I think that's amazing
<Invi> when they built the whole town with the help of the zap apple jam, why does sweet apple acres actually depend on the anual cider selling?
<Lil_B> Invi contracts
<Laurayne> Granny Smith: Trolling The Ponyville History Books Since It Was Founded :)

<LightTrooper105> night taoumi
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight taoumi
*taoumi hugs night
<AdamTheDuck> OOh stream
<Chrysalis> ooh stream, thanks Val
<Caramel> 2,14 don't thank me just yet, I'm just hoping what I have prepared works out
<Eli> DaringDerpy: ... why did i even click that...
<Eli> DaringDerpy: i think that counts towards sexual content
<TheRandomkid321> Am I the only one who sees celestia as kind of a tryant?
<DaringDerpy> this is beyond sexual content
<Eli> TheRandomkid321: yes.
<Caramel> 2,14 daringderpy: I really hope what you posted wasn't
<TheRandomkid321> Eli do you want me to explain why I see celestia as a tryant?
<Vivix> From totally unsupported fanon?
<alexxm> sure do it TheRandomkid321
<TheRandomkid321> It may take up alot of space int he main chat though
<Eli> TheRandomkid321: if it's because she doesnt allow democracie and ruled for thousands of years...
<Eli> well she's still a gentle monarch. nota tyrant
<TheRandomkid321> Eli well thos eare a couple of points.
<LightTrooper105> i hear a PS1..
<Vivix> Those points are totally invalid due to her governing style though
<LightTrooper105> or is ps2
<TheRandomkid321> I don't mean a tryant just... I don't know the word.
<Vivix> Dictator?
<Eli> LightTrooper105: ps2 i think
<LightTrooper105> yeah PS2
<alexxm> oh i haven't seen the old ps2 opening in age
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix Eh.
<TheRandomkid321> Anyway..
<Spectrum_Rush> LightTrooper105: know your system starts man
<Eli> Vivix: nope. she was born into the position
<MadSurge> Enough with "Celestia is a tyrant". She sealed two incredibly dangerous beings (and suffered for putting away her sister) and lightly pranks her subjects occasionally. WHAT A MONSTER.
<LightTrooper105> Spectrum_Rush I did its been long since I last hear it
<Eli> Vivix: she didn't achieve it with military power
<Vivix> Well, we think she was. She and luna took controll some time after the original kingdom fell- according to hearths warming eve
<Vivix> True, but a dictator don't have to-
<Spectrum_Rush> Dat shadow of the Collosus
<LightTrooper105> ^
<Vivix> but she can't be since she probably has a government under her to take some of the workload off
<Vivix> that and Luna
<Vivix> Blueblood probably has some governing power as well-
<MadSurge> Vivix: that's why the mayor exist
<Vivix> Yeah
<Vivix> So, yeah, I don't see how she could be anything like a Tyrant
<MadSurge> Even in old kingdoms the king had vassals to take care of the single towns/ counties
<Eli> the mayor doesn't proove anything. kings always had dukes to watcho over tehir lands. still. celestia is no tyrant or dictator
<Spectrum_Rush> oh god Blueblood with governing power
<Vivix> Well, no, it might indicate or hint at a possible government, btu she probably has all power if it comes to it
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush: like the Earl of Lemon, he lives in a castle alone :D
<AdamTheDuck> Dat kick .-.
<Vivix> Blueblood might have the same power as a Mayor
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<Spectrum_Rush> MadSurge: That Is Acceptable!
<MadSurge> Vivix: yeah :D
<DaringDerpy> what is this?
<Eli> but the people love her. if she wouldn't stick to her own rules, she wouls have been kicked ages ago. alicorn or not
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: wait for it...
<Caramel> 2,14 your youtube link
<Caramel> 2,14 don't post things like that again
<DaringDerpy> yes yes
<Vivix> Yeah, Luna and Celestia do really well as a governing power
<DaringDerpy> won't happen again
<Vivix> even if we don't get to see all the things they actually do
<MadSurge> Vivix: because everyone likes seeing bureaucratic stuff done, amirite
<Vivix> Luna apparently had the power to ban a holiday, so we can say they have much power-
<Vivix> Hehe, MadSurge you are riight
<DaringDerpy> dungeon crawler game?
<DeadpoolDash> what are we watching?
<DaringDerpy> luna is the center of this holiday
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: have you never heard of Shadow of the Colossus? :O
<DaringDerpy> no
<DaringDerpy> never
<Invi> me neither
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Vivix> I have, but only briefly
<Phase4> is this...
<Phase4> yes, i think it is
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: boss game, you go around the world searching for colossi to kill
<Phase4> yes it is
<MadSurge> And they're HUUUUUUGE
<Phase4> i must play this
<Phase4> actually have a copy but its ntsc and my ps2 is pal
<DaringDerpy> hmhm
<Phase4> REALLY anoyed me when it got here and would not work
<MadSurge> Stupid regional locks
<Pink3> Mega_Milk: Have you donemy OC yet :D
<TheRandomkid321> I see celestia as an unfair ruler for she is against nature. She (nd Luna) raise the sun and the moon. And although they may need to do this in order for the sun and moon to rise, there is no explanation why they forcefully change the weather, and act that is done itself in the everfree forest. Also I have noticed alot of racism. Although Unicorns, Earth ponys, and pegasi live together happily animals such as Cows, Donkeys, and
<Caramel> 2,14 Little fun fact: The language spoken in this game was a derivative created from both Latin and Japanese
<Pink3> Mega_Milk: Have you donemy OC yet :D
<MadSurge> Overthinking cartoons for children ahoy
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge Yep that's me.
<MadSurge> Caramel: in Nier there was a village that spoke japanese with the hiragana characters shuffled around
<Vivix> I disagree with that TRK
<MadSurge> ^
<Vivix> Nature is seen as unatural- it's just the way in Equestria, it might actually BE unatural, we don't know
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix you state a fair point.
<Vivix> As for the sun and moon, apparently this has always been done, before Luna and Celestia took controll, the unicorn kingdom did it themselves,
<Vivix> if this was because chaos existed before, or not- we don't really know
<alexxm> what lagauge is this
<Vivix> As for the racism, we mostly establish that to represent a flock-animal, such as a horse's, natural suspicious to anything unknown
<MadSurge> Vivix: the Evertree forest looks like the equivalent of a "living" haunted house :D
<Ryunosuke> i have the thought that weather manipulation is a way to control various wild beasts, such as wendigoes in Hearths Warming Eve
<Ryunosuke> a safety precaution if you will
<Vivix> Could be, most likely it is because, for some reason, in Equestria, and their world, weather does not change withou the aid of magic
<Vivix> Could be-
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix OBJECTION!
<MadSurge> Vivix: or manual shuffling of the clouds
<Vivix> It could also just be because it's more efficient, but RD says..The weather changes on its own, as if it was really unatural- so it probably c an't change on its own?
<Vivix> Hm, yeah
<Ryunosuke> the other problem isnt just the everfree
<Ryunosuke> what about the weather around appeloosa?
<Vivix> Did we get to know anything about it?
<Ryunosuke> like in the desert
<TheRandomkid321> It is stated on an episode that the weather changes by itself in the everfree forest. Ponys fear this place for seemingly no real reason. Sre a few dangerous beasts but that's probably why it's different. There are different kinds of beasts there so the ponys ar afraid of it for no reason other than it's different. So they leave it alone.
<Ryunosuke> i am pretty sure the buffalo do NOT have weather manipulation techniques, though i COULD be wrong
<Vivix> Yeah, they fear the nature of it because it is different. But they fear the beasts because they're dangerous
<DaringDerpy> the meat I bought has so much water in it that it more cooks than fries in the pan...bastards...
<Vivix> They describe it as unatural.. in a way that implies that it is really unique, considering it is hte original home of the royal sisters make this really interesting
<Vivix> Ryunosuke, yeah- the weather there might be left to drift, but it is implied that it can't- but that might just be RD's way of speaking
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix do you not think that the beasts did not once roam the ponyville areas? The reason they never settled in the forest is probably (like humanity) it got weaker and weaker.
<Vivix> The beasts may have, the everfree may have..receeded, but I don't think so
<Vivix> Honestly, the only knowledge we have on everfree history iss...tidbits from episodes
<Vivix> but it don't seem to have changed since Granny Smith was young
<Vivix> Of course, how long that exactly is, we don't know, but one generation is usually enouh to a change in forests
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix because it was never explored or anything probably.
<Vivix> Nono, the royal sisters lived there
<Vivix> in a fully built castle
<DaringDerpy> don't make it angry
<DaringDerpy> bad idea
<Vivix> whether or not it was the Everfree then, or if they created Everfree on purpose, or by accident, we don't know- but most fanfic authors take it to have ...been created when Nightmare moon was banished
<Ryunosuke> but how long ago THAT was we do not know vivix
<Ryunosuke> it could be 1000 years or 5000 years
<DaringDerpy> chaaaarge!
<Vivix> Most speculate that it is around the time Luna was banished, but --hard to say when they settled there with a castle- but minimum 1000 years
<DaringDerpy> bite its foot off!
<Ryunosuke> ya I agree a minimum of 1000 years
<alexxm> kill the daft wee beastie
<TheRandomkid321> Or bottom line, it was just a spooky place for the children to enjoy.
<Vivix> We don't know how long ago..hearths warming eve portrayed, if we did, we could probably guess when, ca, they came into power
<Vivix> It might have been alicorn attempt at creating a self sustainable natural environment- but I don't think it was made as a spooky-fun-place
<TheRandomkid321> poor creature :(
<DaringDerpy> its meat will be delicious
<DaringDerpy> next time bring a grenade launcher
<Eli> ok i'm gonna spell this out: it's a kids show. relax. you put more thought into this stuff than the creators themselfes
<Vivix> Probaly
<Vivix> but that's the FUN part
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)
<Vivix> Saying it's a kid show, don't think about it, is boring- especially if you write or read fanfics
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<original> just throwit it out there http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKGwDetH58A
<Eli> how are you hanging Caramel ?

<Vivix> And don't spam
<Eli> original: just don't
<DaringDerpy> original: read the rules
<original> k
<Vivix> Overanalyzation is part of the fun of being a lorenerd- taking mistakes and background ponies at facevalue since 1982
<DaringDerpy> sounds good...
<TheRandomkid321> What did this creature ever do to you!?
<DaringDerpy> it looked tasty
<Spectrum_Rush> the amount of bruises he must have
<Wrek> 05mornin
<alexxm> is the daft wee beastie dead yet
<Eli> Vivix: i don't know... i like analysation, but don't over do it. reminds me too much of school when we had to interpret books in ways the author could have never thought of
<AdamTheDuck> Good mornin' Wrek
<DaringDerpy> it leaks
<Spectrum_Rush> ahoy thar Wrek
<DaringDerpy> hi Wrek

<MadSurge> 2nd?
<OtakuTom> It's been a while since I last played, so I can't remember how far in this is, but I know it's early.
<AdamTheDuck> So do you just go around killing giant bosses throughout the game?
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck Yyyep.
<TheRandomkid321> pretty much.

<Spectrum_Rush> Its so he can save the one he loves
<Vordox> Inb4 lovestory with Wrek and Caramel .
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe :$
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: the only other thing to do in the game is finding fruits and lizards to upgrade your health and grip
<Vordox> ARROW
<Vordox> ON MSTONE
<Vordox> GENIUS
<Caramel> 2,14 arrows are just to annoy collosi and get their attention
<Vordox> Oh
<Vordox> Double genious :P
<Vordox> They don't act bright do they...?
<MadSurge> Vordox: nope
<Vordox> The whole gameplay is on the giants, eh...
<Vordox> So much focus, so much detail, so much thought of MDA
<MadSurge> Vordox: yeah
<MadSurge> Vordox: the challenge is finding the way to climb/kill them
<Vordox> Caramel: Looking athis just makes me facepalm what Lords of Shadows tried. :D
<MadSurge> Vordox: what did they do?
<Vordox> MadSurge: Failed...
<Vordox> MadSurge: Castlevania Lords of Shadow
<MadSurge> Vordox: yeah, figured, but how did they fail?
<Vordox> MadSurge: Check a gameplay out of the frost giant
<AdamTheDuck> Yay I found it, http://fav.me/d5c7yvc
<RainbowPie> hey everyone
<MadSurge> Vordox: k. Order of Ecclesia though had a really good giant boss climb though
*RainbowPie licks AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> I remember finding that image and wondering what lovely game it was from
*AdamTheDuck noms RainbowPie
<Vordox> MadSurge: You mean the big centaur thing? Yeah
<RainbowPie> hey MadSurge
<MadSurge> Vordox: yeah, Eligor
<Vordox> MadSurge: hated that bastard... so much
<Vordox> Trying to do that with Level 1 restriction..
<Vordox> <---- Worst Hero ever :P
<MadSurge> Vordox: I hated the shadow guy much more :D
<Vordox> No wait..
<Vordox> He's not even a HERO
<Vordox> MadSurge: he was awesome :P
<MadSurge> Hey RainbowPie
<MadSurge> Vordox: of course, but he was balls hard
<Vordox> MadSurge: Compared to Eligor, not even close :P
<MadSurge> Pffft Eligor was strong, but not as annoying
<Eli> would you all stop saying eligor? you're distracting
<Eli> srly
<Eli> i get pings here
<MadSurge> Oops :D
<alexxm> is it the flying beast next
<Vordox> Eli: Change name then :P
<AdamTheDuck> So how many bosses are there?

<AdamTheDuck> RainbowPie, pony_4909, Val is playing Shadow of the Colossus right now.
<RainbowPie> ooh might come have a look
<pony_4909> Thanks.
<AdamTheDuck> So really, this game is more of a puzzle game than an action game?
<Vordox> AdamTheDuck: Experience game
<AdamTheDuck> What do you mean by experience?
<Vordox> AdamTheDuck: It's a unique Genre by itself, where it's focused merely on experiencing the game
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm
<Vordox> Haters gonna hate
<Evil_Spike> SotC?
<MadSurge> Yep
<Evil_Spike> Thought so
<MadSurge> Evil_Spike: wb! haven't seen you in ages!
*AdamTheDuck noms Evil_Spike

<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, Shadow of the Colossus
<Evil_Spike> SotC
<MadSurge> So what was the difficulty of that? That you had to not be spotted to be able to climb?
<Lil_B> OH
<Evil_Spike> It get's difficult to climb some of the Colossi
<Lil_B> thanks AdamTheDuck :)
<Lil_B> that's one big horse
<Caramel> 2,14 more like: "that's one small boy"
<Lil_B> or that
<Lil_B> finally finished watching "M , a Town searches a Murderer"
<AdamTheDuck> I really need to make my IRC background black >.>
<Lil_B> who is playing? Caramel?
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: so why are you actually killing these zings?
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, eeyup

<Caramel> 2,14 kill the collosi, and it brings back the girl
<Dark_Horst> ah
<alexxm> what made the collosi
<Caramel> 2,14 that's a spoiler
<Lil_B> I'd guess the Developer
<Dark_Horst> and a concept artist
<Lil_B> and Programmer
<AdamTheDuck> Damnit Val, why did you have to make the colour behind your text be that same shade of grey that is used in that optical illusion where it goes darker or lighter depending on what colour is around it? :$
<Dark_Horst> birrrrd
<Evo_Kaer> is that Shadow of th Colossus?
<Dark_Horst> it is
<Evo_Kaer> cool
<Vordox> The code in this game is fabulous to EVERY single extent...
<Vordox> <3
<Dark_Horst> quit´e
<Dark_Horst> poke
<OtakuTom> This boss reminds me of trying to get the red coins on the sandbird in Super Mario Sunshine...lol
<Vordox> PHILOMEENA½
<Vordox> Caramel: No girl is worth this...
<Vordox> Not a single girl...
<Dark_Horst> birdy ded
<Caramel> 2,14 I'd say it's closer to Owlousious tbh
<Vordox> Caramel: Oh, then it's fine :P
<MadSurge> ^^^^^
<Dark_Horst> yeah, it occurs to me that you're actually playing an egoiszc douche in this gamr B)
<Caramel> 2,14 cause it's totally not about making the ultimate sacrifice for someone you love
<Vordox> Caramel: Errr.. Going out killing stuff is Ultimate Sacrifice?
<Dark_Horst> actually, i have no idea what its about
<Caramel> 2,14 the things are very dangerous
<Dark_Horst> aside from stabbing big things
<Caramel> 2,14 and they get progressively more dangerous
<TheRandomkid321> Caramel From what I saw they where innocent.
<Vordox> Caramel: They are like Babies ffs! And YOU are watching them!
<Vordox> It's like sticking a fork into a Babies head ffs.
<MadSurge> The shadows around him are like "gee, what a moron"
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: yes, but are they evil? what did they do to deserve death?
<Fl00t4hSh41> What is this? Shadow of the Collosus?
<Dark_Horst> yes
<Caramel> 2,14 jesus, do you want me to spoil it or are you giong to watch?
<Fl00t4hSh41> How far into the game?
<Vordox> Caramel: I'll be quiet. =<
<Zawan> oh i can guess the story now i think
<Lil_B> Lords of the Shadowns of the Lgend of Plagiatism
<TheRandomkid321> Still noone up for minecraft? Just wondering.
<Lil_B> of the I can't hit the right Letters
<Evo_Kaer> to bad I don't own a playstation, thats I game I'd love to play
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpyMuffins
<Evo_Kaer> Hi DerpyMuffins
<Lil_B> hi DerpyMuffins
<Fl00t4hSh41> sup DerpyMuffins
<MadSurge> This is not a long game guys
<MadSurge> Caramel can totally kill them all in a few hours
<OtakuTom> I think the current record is like an hour and 20 minutes...(runs off to Speed Demos Archive)
<TheRandomkid321> And from what i've seen it's not to difficult. But I wouldn't know.
<OtakuTom> 1 hour, 34 minutes, 30 seconds is the record
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: it looks easier because Caramel already knows how to kill them :D
<Evo_Kaer> I like that horse
<MadSurge> PONY
<Caramel> 2,14 Arro is a true bro
<DerpyMuffins> So what game is this?
<Caramel> 2,14 stays with you even though you take him to places with giant murderous building
<im_texting_my_dog> what's this>
<im_texting_my_dog> ?*
<MadSurge> im_texting_my_dog: Shadow of the Colossus
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shadowof the colossus DerpyMuffins and im_texting_my_dog
<DerpyMuffins> I knew this game looked familiar
<Fl00t4hSh41> And now the fun begins
<DerpyMuffins> It has a sad ending though
<Caramel> 2,14 SHUDDAP
<Evo_Kaer> finally, lunch is here
<DerpyMuffins> First time Caramel?
<Caramel> 2,14 no, just don't spoil it
<DerpyMuffins> I didnt, just said the mood
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: well yeah, that's spoiling too
<Caramel> 2,14 saying it has a bad ending gives them ideas, just don't do it
<AdamTheDuck> >.> Some people don't want anything said
<MadSurge> ^^^^
<TheRandomkid321> It's sad becasue the horse dies and the guy kills himself over the loss of his companion... Nah i'm just bucking around...what if that actually happens though o-o
<MadSurge> ^ :D
<DerpyMuffins> Kicked
<TheRandomkid321> DerpyMuffins who?
<DerpyMuffins> Nvm
<Fl00t4hSh41> Gotta love that beard

<MadSurge> THE BEARD IS CLIMBABLE
<TheRandomkid321> A wild party animal appeared.
<ShyBetaFemale> i partied so hard last night
<DerpyMuffins> I thought most of the colossus were friendly?
<ShyBetaFemale> i don't know if i can go tonight
<ShyBetaFemale> but i want to
<Fl00t4hSh41> Can't be healthy for that colossi to have all that black stuf inside his head
<shana> some get aggressive if you stab them DerpyMuffins ...
<Fl00t4hSh41> just look at how it sprays everywhere when he gets stabbed
<TheRandomkid321> Poor collosi :(
<DerpyMuffins> He has hands why not use them
<MadSurge> They're ugly things, why are they poor?
<MadSurge> KILL THEM ALL I SAY
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge just because they're ugly they deserve to die?
<MadSurge> YES
<Vordox> This is like going out into town, and killing hobos that cannot defend themselves good enough. ;_;
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<Vordox> Me: "HAi,I'm here to kill you"
<Vordox> Hobo: "Whuh, hah, why?"
<Evo_Kaer> thats what I call acupuncture
<Vordox> Me: "Some girl"
<Vordox> Hobo: "kai...wait wha*ded*"
<Fl00t4hSh41> Vordox: It's ok to kill them. God tells you to
<MadSurge> DED
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah cause, giant shadow beast building monsters = hobos
<MadSurge> :D

<Vordox> From what they look like in this game, they are..."cute"?
<AdamTheDuck> Can someone ping me? I want to test something.
<Ish> what are we watching?
<Vordox> Like I said, babies.
<Fl00t4hSh41> AdamTheDuck: Ping
<AdamTheDuck> Ish, Shadow of the Collosus
<DerpyMuffins> You'd think they hide their eak spot better
<DerpyMuffins> weak
<Caramel> 2,14 the weak spots are only visible when wielding the sword
<Caramel> 2,14 the sword reveals it
<DerpyMuffins> I ment with armor
<AdamTheDuck> Well at least now that I have a black background I can read Caramel's text a lot more easily :$
<Vordox> Fish boss
<Ish> how many colossi are dead now?
<DerpyMuffins> Some die willingly, others eat you
<Fl00t4hSh41> DerpyMuffins: The hero not so much carves the colossi to bits with the swords and provides them with a really agressive accupuncture treatment
<MadSurge> So the next colossus if a fish thing?
<shana> do you hide your weak spots with armor DerpyMuffins?
<Ish> how many colossi are dead now?
<im_texting_my_dog> Horsey!
<Fl00t4hSh41> DerpyMuffins: Hence the need to go for specific points on its body

<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: we already got skime ponies, I don't think we need a gak pony
<flufflepuff> whats new
<Spectrum_Rush> *slime
<Sumica> 00,10think about it thought Spectrum_Rush
<thelonepony> Nothing much and you flufflepuff :3
<flufflepuff> same :S
<Fl00t4hSh41> Spectrum_Rush: What do you mean? Slug Box'es oc?
<pony_3660> Twi really wants to be a tree.
<Dken2021> hey, anyone interested in a Keldeo C-Gear password?
<Spectrum_Rush> Fl00t4hSh41: no
<Sumica> 00,10and just wtf were you doing about it mayor mare?
<PINKPEGASISTER> XD
<doctor_whooves127> late every year
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Given the real hair on the pony toys puring slime on them probably isn't a good idea
<Cypresswolf> My positive speech wasn't enough for you? :|
<CriticKitten> LOL
<CriticKitten> Chillax.
<Dken2021> and it's all twilight's fault
<Sumica> 00,10you suck caramel.
<CriticKitten> Damnit Caramel, you had ONE JOB
<CrimsonPhoenix> DITZY DOO
<PINKPEGASISTER> eeeuuup
<Ryunosuke> that Caramel
<doctor_whooves127> poor derpy
<CrimsonPhoenix> DITZY DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<PINKPEGASISTER> derpy
<J_E_Smith71> Ditzy? Wonder if she
<Mega_Milk> XD
<Katalenic> Oh Caramel everytime you do this
<Sumica> 00,10time to go get a gender change and move to appleloosa
<J_E_Smith71> Dang it
<alexxm> ditzy is derpy
<CriticKitten> Sumica: You mean AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPLELOOOOSA
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: i find it funny you're the only one who didnt ping caramel
<J_E_Smith71> Ditzy? Wonder if she's related to Derpy (wink wink)
<DocSane> alexxm: She's a different color.
<CriticKitten> Rip headphone users.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Because squeesing a bid like a flute is not animal abuse
<CrimsonPhoenix> MONTAGE
<Sumica> 00,10oh look java update
<CrimsonPhoenix> (with winter wrap-up instrumental
<DocSane> Activate OCD powers!
<RaveBrony> Oooo
<PINKPEGASISTER> XD
<Sumica> 00,10still say seting up all those bells woul take longer then just you know doing it one by one
<Katalenic> Winter Wrap up
<doctor_whooves127> this doesnt make sense why did no one think of this sooner
<Ryunosuke> question
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Or just having more than one pony wake animals
<RaveBrony> Sumica: ikr?
<Sumica> 00,102 weeks later, almost done
<PINKPEGASISTER> why didnt they just do that to clear up the snow
<Ryunosuke> where do they put all of that snow?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the music work in this episode is truly beautiful
<flufflepuff> But they can use the bell system next year
<CriticKitten> Since apparently only Fluttershy did it
<DocSane> Here's Ditzy now. She's a pallette swapped Derpy.
<Lil_B> spike is such a good worker :) because he has hands
<J_E_Smith71> Maybe Dizty Doo is that Derpy with the red mane from earlier in the ep
<Sumica> 00,10Ryunosuke, it's molestopias problem now
<Colt_Brovakiin> haha Lil_B :P
<Sumica> 00,10much like that ball of parasprites
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Bronysith> Sumica: planetside2 after wrek awakens from his viking slumber?
<DocSane> Ditzy Doo and Derpy Doo are sisters.
<doctor_whooves127> so doctor whoove s was so set on helping he showed up twice
<CrimsonPhoenix> Parasprites are a lie
<PINKPEGASISTER> eeeuuup
<Sumica> 00,10I am thinking i might go back to bed my self
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's all a lie to hide the truth
<Colt_Brovakiin> Sumica: I have not left it :P
<PINKPEGASISTER> shes the secritary...
<CrimsonPhoenix> the truth about the unsung...
<CriticKitten> I know exactly what to say. That thing's hideous.
<CriticKitten> Those three colors don't work together at all....er, I mean, YAY HAPPY ENDING
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sing her song and become nothing.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: didja even sleep
<Sumica> 00,10some yes
<Bronysith> DO U EVEN LIFT?
<RaveBrony> :I
<Fl00t4hSh41> CriticKitten: It's like the pappal guards uniform
<PINKPEGASISTER> oh spike
<Sumica> 00,10and hub failed me again with no pony ad's
<bcb> partys all night
<Fl00t4hSh41> It doesn't have to be pretty
<J_E_Smith71> Maybe the fact that they were late with Winter Wrap Up is why Canterlot and other towns look down on them. Maybe they think that Ponyville is a hick town that can't do things right
<PINKPEGASISTER> wats next
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well Sumica the date has been announced anyway
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Maybe they think online plugs are enough right now

<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean not only the scene it's trying to show
<shizumobile> But too much rain down here this week for them
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the whole technic used, the style
<Eli> CrimsonPhoenix: and does it say "here lies the ashes of the elements of harmony" on the plate?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Eli, I believe so yes
<Bronysith> yup
*Bronysith licks Saturn awake
<Bronysith> nothing
<CrimsonPhoenix> Incineration would be better in case of someponies trying to use Black Magic to use them for their own good
<CrimsonPhoenix> or something
<Stinko|TF2> Nopony wants a Zombie Pinkie Pie
<Stinko|TF2> NOPONY
<Fl00t4hSh41> Stinko|TF2: sounds like it would be a fun zombie

<Fl00t4hSh41> Eeyup

<Saturn> 8,1it's 1337 time!
<GilDash> No, 1337 time is at 13:37.
<Eli> now's 1721 then
<GilDash> Is it sad that I can see 13:37 and think, 'It's Leet o'clock'?
<SA7URN> 8,1thar
<Stinko|TF2> Yes
<Stinko|TF2> YES IT IS
<SA7URN> 8,1GilDash: i misread that as "let's see your cock"
<GilDash> SA7URN: I'm not surprised anymore. XD
<Spectrum_Rush> hah americans dont get 1337 time, they only get 137 time
<PeachStreak|wakingup> no stream eh?
<Eli> where's saturn? someone who writes weird replaced him

<pony_7538> hey guys
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ I hear my new custom arrived! Who wants to see it
<pony_7538> me
<Eli> hi random pony_7538 with a serial number no one can keep in mind.
<pony_7538> ya!
<Cypresswolf> http://i.imgur.com/ntdbi.png
<pony_7538> thats awesome
<Saturn> 08,01my favourite Enterprise is the D
<Dken2021> neat
<Fl00t4hSh41> Nice
<Eli> Cypresswolf: a shadowolt? they had one 30sec apearence...
<PINKPEGASISTER> is there a stream
<Cypresswolf> I'm told there's extra pony stuff in the box too, but I want to wait to see them myself
<GilDash> Saturn: The 1701-D... That's TNG then.
<Dken2021> Eli and yet the best characters in the show
<Cypresswolf> I <3 Shadowbolts
<Eli> Dken2021: ...welp. opinions. I know i watch the show for other reasons
<pony_7538> i <3 wonderbolts?
<Cypresswolf> I have a Timberwolf being made for me too :3 that's for another day
<Vivix> Timberwolves looked awesome
<Eli> Dken2021: but yeah, maybe if you're lucky, the anounced reapearence of a vilain in S3 is the shadowbolts
<Fl00t4hSh41> Shadow Bolts need to be made into a canon vilian team
<Jake> they are on the vilian poster
<pony_7538> ive hit a milestone
<Dken2021> then again, the shadowbolts were just a figmintation from nightmare moon
<Cypresswolf> :) OK, maybe a little spoiler http://busoni.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5ey57b My Timberwolf as it was a month ago
<sparkarez> :O
<Malk> Hello Everypony
<Stinko|Chores> GTG
<Dken2021> wow, that's awesome Cypresswolf, and you even got glowing eyes too
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ The eyes actually glow - They GLOW!
<Vivix> Eli, even if joke, that can get you banned. No s3, ever
<alexxm> how are things Malk
<Vivix> well, not until november
<Eli> Vivix: what?
<Jake> nooooooooooooo they completely canceled MLP in germany WHYY
<Malk> good alexxm
<Vivix> Reintroduced as villain in S3, or did I read that wrong?
<Jmo> Rofl
<guynooneremembers> why so long until mlp why!?
<Eli> Vivix: sorry, i didn't quite catch that rule
<Vivix> Any talk of S3 is bannable, so we keep quiet about it, except airdate I suppose
<guynooneremembers> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 20 days, 23 hours, 29 minutes, 9 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<Chrysalis> damnit now i know there are crystals in s3
<Fl00t4hSh41> What triggers tom?
<Eli> Vivix: where's that written down? that rule sounds stupid.
<Vivix> ^
<Chrysalis> damn you tom for spoiling
<Jake> so 5pm it is
<Vivix> The topic Eli
<Vivix> and we like that rule
<Cypresswolf> The artist's husband hooked up the light up eyes - there'll be a switch to turn them on & off and a space that opens to replace the battery - thats all they could tell me without giving too much away
<Chrysalis> Eli its the first rule
<sparkarez> and Empires :'(
<Vivix> Tom broke the rule too ;__;
<guynooneremembers> tom is finally usefull!
<Eli> Chrysalis: uh... no?
<guynooneremembers> Fl00t4hSh41: !cd triggers him
<Vivix> Eli, look at IRC topic
<Vivix> "S3 Spoilers are not permitted. Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban"
<Dken2021> hmm
<Dken2021> !topic
<Dken2021> oh well
<Vivix> Some guy got banned for linking to one of the songs from the con
<Vivix> Sjust how it is
<Eli> Vivix: ...wow. they overdo it a bit, but well...whatever
<Chrysalis> Hmm, Littlest pet shop
<Chrysalis> not sure if i want to give it a chance
<Vivix> I like it- I want to know as little as absolutely possible
<Dken2021> never knew hasbro owned littlest petshop
<Eli> Vivix: well i understand that. that's a real spoiler
<Chrysalis> Eli its not overdoing it
<Vivix> I probably wont watch it- but I won't switch off it is an on
<Chrysalis> there are places you can go to talk spoilers
<Chrysalis> but you can't unhear them
<Chrysalis> hang on
<Vivix> yeah, I didn't know anything about it until a few days ago
<guynooneremembers> ive heard some of the s3 songs
<Chrysalis> that one is HEAVY twilight inspired
<Vivix> in fact, I knew so little htat that !cd would have been a shock to me
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpiboo.ru/images/127704
<Eli> guynooneremembers: yeah, we're just talking about it not to talk about it. so don't
<Chrysalis> http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/dRStYQ.jpg
<Chrysalis> if this isnt based on twilight, i will eat that hat
<Dken2021> huh
<CrimsonPhoenix> SCIENCE http://i.imgur.com/O1ezt.jpg

<killerpony7733> sparkarez Theres a line of wanting to wait and getting it as you go. Or spoiling it beforehand knowing what'll happen etc
<guynooneremembers> Cypresswolf: you should see my friend buying soda, he throws it EVERYWHERE
<Fl00t4hSh41> Cypresswolf: The burns in your lap say otherwise
<Dken2021> Lil_B wha?

<guynooneremembers> bet that controller would have been shait
<Dken2021> Lil_B but it's a big chunk of plastic......
<guynooneremembers> chat? chat?! live!!!!
<Lil_B> Dken2021 yes, and Honestly, If IU had to decide between this and the Wii Light-Gun... I would choose the Wii thing -.-
<guynooneremembers> yay
<Fl00t4hSh41> Lil_B: Isn't it just a lightgun?
<Lil_B> currently it ahas 10% of it's goal reached after 3 days. 27 more days to go for the 500k Dollar goal
<Lil_B> Fl00t4hSh41 yes, sometimes when I'm not sure if I should use a "-" I just use whatever comes to mind first
<Cypresswolf> :3 I have a game for everypony - guess what drink in my hand right now :)

<Quick_Thinker> shit
<cow334> fluttercry: i dont like it ethier
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: I dislike most of them...
<Nyu> most people would have panicked
<RAWRity> You know, she's taking the whole "found a mutilated body on the beach" really well.
<pony_499> fluttercry: poor you, eat bacon
<Nyu> and he would have died, but i love smart girls <3
<Petrified_Discord> Fl00t4hSh41: Kinda interesting to see what he does now that he's blind
<alexxm> why is she so calm about the heavily mutilated man
<CrimsonPhoenix> fluttercry, you do realize that anime is just a cartoon right?
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: it's one of my favourites
<RAWRity> fluttercry: I like anime. I hate this show.
<Coldays> death to the nonbelever

<RainbowAsh> What did she do with his arm?
<rdibp|nyu> GENIUS
<Saturn> 08,01there are only a few i like
<pony_499> rdibp|nyu: dont lie
<CrimsonPhoenix> saying you hate anime is like saying you hate cartoons that comes from Japan
<Coldays> not to u fluttercry to the guy on the ground
<Nyu> saturn likes oran high host club
<fluttercry> 05,15Saturn yeah that's generally how I am.
<RainbowAsh> CrimsonPhoenix, literally
<Nyu> because of twincest
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: I think he said distate, not hate
<RaveBrony> I like WAY too much anime :D
<Saturn> 08,01Nyu: i have no idea what that is
<fluttercry> 05,15CrimsonPhoenix then I guess I dislike most cartoons from japan. Sue me
<cowvarkian> *distaste
<pony_499> imma go get myself some julebrus, brb
<Saturn> 08,01but by the way you said it, i'm guessing it involves gay sex.
<RaveBrony> Otaku Forevverrrrr!
<cowvarkian> bah spelling
<Nyu> you know what it is :3
<DerpyMuffins> Is it explained how Lucky got her powers?
<Nyu> nope
<cowvarkian> Saturn: not exactly

<Fl00t4hSh41> DerpyMuffins: Born with them, if my memory serves
<fluttercry> 05,15wat
<CrimsonPhoenix> fluttercry, while most animes shares a similar style of drawing, I still don't think the origin of a show is a valid reason to hate it
<rdibp|nyu> hai Caramel
<Dken2021> ....wha?
<RaveBrony> What in the
<RaveBrony> O_o

<pony_499> Saturn: movie night in 0 mins
<Caramel> 2,14 they do it as a joke because apparantly girls like forbidden love
<RainbowAsh> cowvarkian, internet
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: or is that what it always meant
*RaveBrony crosses Ouran off his "Animes to Watch" list
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: ah, ok
<Saturn> 08,01Caramel: still EW
<Nyu> why did they give him an IV for brused ribs, and a few cuts?
<Caramel> 2,14 also, never thought I'd see the day where I managed to creep out Saturn
<cowvarkian> RainbowAsh: that explains it
<RaveBrony> Woah! Its 2pm already??
<fluttercry> 05,15CrimsonPhoenix You are reading way too much into this. I didn't say I hate it because it's japanese, I said I disliked most anime. Doesn't mean that I hate the origin.
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<RAWRity> Caramel: yeah, it's sort of a parody/deconstruction of reverse harem/Shoujo series
<rdibp|nyu> "silly buy, there are no suh things as machine guns"
<Lil_B> and I'm back :) had chilli Con Cane

<Ninjazz> Hey Dken2021.
<DaringDerpy> can't watch the movie like this
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gotta dance bore the killings

<cow334> lawl
<Stormman3100> lmao
<Coldays> his turn
<Lil_B> JunkerKun thanks :P
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lil_B, I doubt it's a shamisen. Shamisen you hold like a guitar
<Ryunosuke> Chinese BASS CANNON!
<Canadian_Brony> Atleast the music is good.
<Combustiblelemons> Your music is no mnatch for my spears!
<Ninjazz> This isn't looking so good...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lil_B, I thing koto is the name of it. Gonna look it up real quick
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ryunosuke, Pfft that's nothing

<Kencolt> I think the Koto is a Japanese instrument.

<Lil_B> ASoftFluffyThing we are thinking about the same 2 Instruments, but can't decide which one is which :P
<JunkerKun> Kencolt: So is shamisen
<Lil_B> Kencolt both are
<Coldays> fail
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lil_B, yep it's a koto
<DerpStar> Kencolt: You are assuming they are Chinese hitmen
<Kencolt> So, this being a CHINESE film, it's probably a similar, but not the same instrument.
<Mega_Milk> sooo close.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> he got damn close tho
<JunkerKun> Kencolt: But as far as I know shamisen and koto were created in China
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> epic
<Kencolt> They are DRESSED like Ch8inese Hitmen.
<Canadian_Brony> No! Not that guy!

<Ninjazz> Oh mai...
<Forgottencrow> :(
<Fl00t4hSh41> Lets get back to the movie
<String_Shredder> "I forehead you"
<Mega_Milk> Did they just steal from a mute woman????
<ASoftFluffyThing> What's she saying?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I am just pragmatic. :D
<SirGanjalf> :O
<Coldays> flashback
<SirGanjalf> What a twist

<Combustiblelemons> ohshi-
<Mega_Milk> Kotano: Oh yeah thats instant hell right there.
<RainbowAsh> Fl00t4hSh41, lots of people from mlp are working on it, so why not give it a try?
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Dat hurt
<Invi> eww
<CrimsonPhoenix> WHAT A BUNCH OF LOSERS
<Invi> oh hay Ninjazz ^^
<MaxTheBrony> :(
<RainbowAsh> CrimsonPhoenix, thanks, maybe I will. ^^

<Sundaysmile> D'AWWWWWWWWWWW
<NeonGreenKitten> What is this!?
<Ninjazz> Hey Invi.
<Thorn> What the fuck is this movie.
<Coldays> sad
<NeonGreenKitten> LOLLY WHY?
<Katalenic> cow334 when the movie B end it's better to you tell me the truth if you finished the game or not u.u
<Pinkieshy_Dash> That's a quite long flash back
<scout19_tf2> hey YO wuts up everyony:) aww shit the sad part
<cow334> WER TEH LOVE
<Canadian_Brony> Thorn Kung Fu Hustle
<J_E_Smith71> I oughta ask Sumi to try streaming Ninja Turtles since it's right after MLP and he already has the live feed on anyways
<cow334> TEH LOVE
<Canadian_Brony> hi scout19_tf2
<Mega_Milk> wow that is a very very very old lollipop.
<Combustiblelemons> D:
<MadSurge> Is she mute or what?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wait RainbowAsh are you seriously considering watching a show because people in there also worked in MLP?
<Thorn> LOLLIPOP
<Bogy> :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's retarded
<Lil_B> Mega_Milk but still sealed
<Canadian_Brony> MadSurge mute and deaf
<NoPonyEpic> It was probably stale anyways
<Coldays> hes a ass
<ASoftFluffyThing> Is that lollipop good after all those years?
<Combustiblelemons> That was sad.
<NeonGreenKitten> Can someone help me? What is this? I'm confused...
<Invi> :'( he broke the Lolipop
<scout19_tf2> that guys a dick
<Thorn> NO FUCK THE LOLLIPOP BITCH
<fluttercry> 05,15CrimsonPhoenix isn't that basically how MLP got popular? Because people from PPG worked on it?
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<RainbowAsh> CrimsonPhoenix, that was basically my initial reason to watch ponies, so why not?
<alexxm> noot the lollipop
<fluttercry> 05,15and Fosters
<J_E_Smith71> NeonGreenKitten: Kung Fu Hustle
<MaxTheBrony> So sad oart
<cow334> Katalenic: i promise i wont lie if i dont beat it
<MaxTheBrony> part
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: it's pure sugar, those must last for a while
<NeonGreenKitten> Ah.
<cow334> daww this ending
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: Those voice actors work on a whole lot of shows, including a lot of bad onees
<Coldays> and the otherguy still gave him some loot
<Thorn> This is the end?
<scout19_tf2> no
<Combustiblelemons> Nope.
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: why do you think LPS won't be shit?
<Ninjazz> My initial reason to watch MLP was because it got so much attention.
<Canadian_Brony> Thorn nowhere close
<Combustiblelemons> It's only the beginning
<SirGanjalf> dat mambo
<Thorn> oh shit.
<CrimsonPhoenix> It wasn't my number 1 reason
<Coldays> no theres much more
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Yup Thorn, these are the credits xD
<Ninjazz> I'll wait for the crowd to sort it out.
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again it's mostly VAs in there
<Combustiblelemons> Why does this remind me of sleeping dogs?
<Lil_B> Music= Night Club Band (no, thats really the name of the soing)
<Thorn> AWW FUCK
<fluttercry> 05,15If it's just VAs then yeah, that's not worth it. A bunch of VAs from ponies are in Strawberry SHortcake, and that's never good
<MadSurge> fluttercry: Ikr
<DerpStar> I had to go what did I miss?
<Dashie> my first time wating mlp my friend forced me
<Mega_Milk> hmmm
<Ninjazz> Oh. If it's just that, then nvm.
<Mega_Milk> thats a change of luck -lol
<SirGanjalf> cool hat
<JunkerKun> fluttercry: Shortcake... ugh...
<Invi> Lil_B, liek the song ''sing sing sing'' which is completly instrumental? ^^
<Lil_B> Sabre Dance :)
<RainbowAsh> Fl00t4hSh41, some of the writers are working on it, too. I have no idea how good it is going to be, really, but I am willing to give it a fair try before making up my mind.
<Canadian_Brony> ohia DerpStar. Dunno, what's the last thing you remember?
<Lil_B> Invi xD
<MadSurge> Hello Ninjazz :3
<Canadian_Brony> fromt he movie
<J_E_Smith71> fluttercry: Well Larson's a writer and Ingram's doing the music
<Combustiblelemons> fluttercry: i think it was to do with proving that animation can still be done by a lone innovator instead of a large animation group
<DerpStar> What did he do with the lolipop?
<Lil_B> Invi another kind of ironic
<scout19_tf2> boy scouts.....................with tanks
<MadSurge> DerpStar: threw it into a wall
<Ryunosuke> those boy scouts... with a tank.... seems legit
<cow334> DerpStar: threw it against a wall
<Pinkieshy_Dash> uhm DerpStart, u dun wanna know
<Ninjazz> Hey MadSurge.
<Canadian_Brony> DerpStar he smashed it against a wall and ran.
<Pinkieshy_Dash> DerpStar*
<JunkerKun> DerpStar: He slapped her hand so the lollipop fell down
<SirGanjalf> "It's only a model'
<Combustiblelemons> That scout's a spy!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Chinese boyscouts are serious business
<Kencolt> A VA is only as good as the material he or she is given. Thinkon that.
<SirGanjalf> ...
<Sundaysmile> EVILLLLLLLLLL
<Ryunosuke> ZUUUUL
<Lil_B> Chinese Military Shovel > Swiss Army Knife
<SirGanjalf> I've got a baaad feelings about this..
<ASoftFluffyThing> Suddenly freak weather
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Lol
<mitamaking> Crap what was the A movie again
<CrimsonPhoenix> I admit I was kinda interested for the hilarity purpose
<Canadian_Brony> Lil_B seems legit
<scout19_tf2> dinkleberg!!!!!!!
<Ninjazz> Bad juju.
<Sundaysmile> inb4 stay puff marshmallowpony
<Thorn> I'm sorry, random buisness dude with no reason, but what the fuck are you saying?
<fluttercry> 05,15As much as I respect Faust, I don't think she's the only reason MLP is good. It takes an entire team, not just one person
<NoPonyEpic> Why did I never watch an insane asylum as a boy scout :(
<DerpStar> Oh No :( I thought that would turn him good, and unlock his chi potential or something Chinese like that
<CrimsonPhoenix> though from what I saw the animation is mediocre
<Lil_B> Canadian_Brony you have to see the Video about it xD
<Combustiblelemons> indeed fluttercry
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, agreed.
<Ryunosuke> mitamaking, you are watching it, kung fu hustle
<mitamaking> oh yeah
<Coldays> lo
<Thorn> And why is there a thunder tornado over that random building?
<JunkerKun> fluttercry: But still without Lauren there would be no MLP as we know it now
<Sundaysmile> barrel roll
<String_Shredder> Inb4 the Shining
<Fl00t4hSh41> my main problem with LPS is the setting. I can't see how it could be interesting. MLP has adventure and supernatural threats
<MadSurge> There's too much chinese stereotypes, I need an american to balance this movie out!
<cow334> fluttercry: they all worked together to make the show as awesme as it is no lone wolf in it they work as a team ^^
<Thorn> AND WHERE THE FUCK AND WHO THE FUCK IS THAT DOUCHEBAG
<Combustiblelemons> inception.
<Lil_B> Shining refference, because had to be there
<Thorn> WHAT IS THIS I DONT EVEN
<SirGanjalf> D:
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wht Fl00t4hSh41 said
<Coldays> blood
<Dark_Horst> Fl00t4hSh41: lps?
<SirGanjalf> REDRUM
<fluttercry> 05,15yup. Dat Shining
<Sundaysmile> looks legit
<Fl00t4hSh41> Whats LPS gonna bring in? An evil bank who wants to forclose on their mortage?
<ASoftFluffyThing> So much blood.
<Combustiblelemons> it's only cherryaid
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Guise, go watch Saberspark's Ballad of the Brony for the best truths about why MLP is so awesome
<Kencolt> Fl00t4hSh41: We have to idea WHAT the setting of LPS will be. We must wait and see3.
<Ponies47> Dat blood
<Lil_B> The Shinnin'
<Thorn> I dont even wanna know.
<Canadian_Brony> Thorn this movie works on some fucked up logic. Take the sudden river of blood for instance.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Littlest Pet Ship
<CrimsonPhoenix> LPS is extreme Slice of lif style of show
<MadSurge> fluttercry: if it was only Faust, then S2 would have sucked
<Fl00t4hSh41> *shop
<Vash> now where is that pyschic kid
<Ninjazz> This place be so haunted.
<fluttercry> 05,15MadSurge exactly
<J_E_Smith71> That's the strange the blood should get off on the second floor
<SirGanjalf> inb4 creepy twins
<alexxm> he's ingisted fear gas
<CrimsonPhoenix> worse, teenage slice of life show
<fluttercry> 05,15And though I sort of disliked S2, it wasn't terrible
<Coldays> this is the face of EVIL
<DerpStar> So season 3 will be streamed here at 10:00am right?
<Thorn> Now I'm reminded of Alton Tower's nemisis.
<Ryunosuke> that crazy guy
<Combustiblelemons> just ignore all the laws of physics as you know it and you're cool.
<fluttercry> 05,15DerpStar yup
<ASoftFluffyThing> Uh.
<SirGanjalf> okaay...
<Invi> that guy :D
<Ryunosuke> nice flip flops
<Bogy> ok..
<Coldays> Pure Evil
<fluttercry> 05,15To be honest, if I had found MLP in the middle of S2, I probably wouldn't have stuck with it
<Thorn> If you dont know, its an inverted rollercoaster with rivers of blood
<Cypresswolf> Sitting on da toilet!
<MadSurge> fluttercry: and from what I saw about S3 we can expect good times :)
<BroHoof> hello everypony, what're we watchin'?
<Dark_Horst> dat voice
<Fl00t4hSh41> He's a casual Killer
<Canadian_Brony> hi BroHoof. Kung Fu Hustle
<scout19_tf2> its ol man asian
<Bronysith> fluttercry: season 1 is far surperior
<Ryunosuke> Dark_Horst, kung fu hustle
<Sundaysmile> he eats ciggarettes
<Thorn> And who the fuck is this?
<SirGanjalf> badass voicer
<fluttercry> 05,15Amen Bronysith
<SirGanjalf> *voice
<Katalenic> Hello BroHoof we're watching Kung Fu Hustle
<Coldays> Hi BroHoof
<Thorn> But still...nice flipflops.
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, you only saw a fraction of season 3
<DerpStar> Huzzah
<Coldays> kung fu hustle
<Dark_Horst> Ryunosuke: i didnt ask that
<Combustiblelemons> Season 1 fluttershy is different to season 2
<Lil_B> fluttercry to be honest, I don't like half the episodes, in both seasons, if there wouldn't be a fandom, I wouldn't even watch it
<cow334> dude his flipflops are the stuff
<Ryunosuke> Dark_Horst, oh
<BroHoof> kung fu..lovely
<Ryunosuke> chat scrolled too fast :p
<Combustiblelemons> she's a bit annoying in S2 in my opinion
<Dashie> sup BroHoof we are wating kung fu hustle
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I would agree on fluttercry about season 1 vs season 2 though I am still searching for the reasons why
<Ninjazz> I think the charm just loses the effect over time.
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: secret, I didn't watch any of the previews. Only written rumors
<Combustiblelemons> I don't think it's that
<Canadian_Brony> fail
<Ryunosuke> that punch
<scout19_tf2> haha
<Coldays> lol
<Coldays> ha
<scout19_tf2> dat asain
<cow334> DANM
<Ryunosuke> harder
<SirGanjalf> ooh, kinky
<Alchemist> kinky
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dayum
<scout19_tf2> HARDER:[
<cow334> kinky ...i see
<Bronysith> fluttercry: season 2 did have luna eclipsed though...lol
<Coldays> ha
<Thorn> BITCH SLAP
<Canadian_Brony> dem guns
<Bogy> too hard?
<Bogy> :)
<cow334> O-O
<Coldays> cought it
<SirGanjalf> I am IRON MAAAAAN
<fluttercry> 05,15Bronysith oh you mean the most overrated episode of the series?
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<DaringDerpy> like a boss
<Canadian_Brony> oh snap
<scout19_tf2> :O
<ASoftFluffyThing> Whoa
<DerpyMuffins> Neo
<Tassadork> peace dood
<cow334> MATRIX
<Thorn> Now I'm waiting for the rape scene waiting to happen.
<BroHoof> what in the hell O_O
<Bronysith> fluttercry: thats not the most overrated episode, a friend in need is
<J_E_Smith71> fluttercry: Or at least the most overplayed here during BMN
<Invi> fluttercry, not the sonic rainboom one?
*SirGanjalf bows before sonic grandpa
<Coldays> boom
<Lil_B> I did not Like the Luna episodes, everyone acted unnatural, sit made no sense, and the moral was butchered
<Bronysith> fluttercry: i think winter wrap up is my fav episode, idk why
<Thorn> Wait, what kind of bullet is that?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dayum
<Mega_Milk> hmmm........
<fluttercry> 05,15Nah. Sonic Rainboom was at least good the first time I saw it
<JunkerKun> Thorn: Paper bullet
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, And Lesson Zero?
<BroHoof> wut o.O
<JunkerKun> Thorn: I totally saw it bend under his fingers
<Thorn> Ohhh
<red_ony> Lil_B: I'll second that although Luna grew on me after a few watchings
<Thorn> CASINO NINJA
<cow334> i liked party of one my favorite so far
<CrimsonPhoenix> A friend in deed has one of the best, most complete song in the entire series and explores Pinkie's character
<RainbowAsh> Best episode discussion? A friend in Deed, hooves down.
<fluttercry> 05,15Ninjazz like Sonic Rainboom, I enjoyed it the first time.
<Thorn> HOOKER ALERT
<Canadian_Brony> I don't have a favourite episode.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sonic Rainboom is actually great
<Lil_B> red_ony I have nothing against Luna in this episode... I hated everyone else in this episode
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, Oh first time? I get you there.
<fluttercry> 05,15Winter Wrap Up is still the high bar for me.
<Alchemist> Im gonna kill you with death until you die.
<Lyra`> i hate it when i meow at cats, and they dont meow back. Unbelievably rude.
<DaringDerpy> look before you sleep...idiot twilight is too cute
<Bronysith> fluttercry: huh?
<Combustiblelemons> What is the worst MLP ep then?
<Thorn> Also, would homestucks fit into the brony fandom>
<CrimsonPhoenix> heck the sonic rainboom moment is IMO the best moment in the series
<Coldays> here we go Fight
<Fl00t4hSh41> Who doesn't bring a giant bell when infiltrating the enemy lair?
<Bronysith> Thorn: homestucks are the worst fandom
<CrimsonPhoenix> just maybe for that stretch
<fluttercry> 05,15Worst? Mysterious Mare Do Well
<red_ony> Lil_B: Her ancient way of speaking just didn't work for me at first..oh well :D
<Canadian_Brony> Fl00t4hSh41 *slowly raises a hoof*
<Lil_B> red_ony especially Pinkie Pie, the lesson should have been that you shouldn't make pranks or jokes if it hurts someone
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Violence won't save us..
<Combustiblelemons> Yeah... Didn't like that one much either
<Bronysith> fluttercry: i find the season 2 finale to be overrated
<fluttercry> 05,15Bronysith oh I completely forgot about that
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah
<Ninjazz> It was just rushed.
<cow334> O-O
<Combustiblelemons> The songs in the finale were meh.
<cow334> his face
<red_ony> Lil_B: but hurting someone sometimes is really fun :)
<Ninjazz> It's not overrated any more.
<scout19_tf2> hehehehehehe
<Thorn> I mean the....less than perfect part of the brony fandom and
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Dark_Horst> why do so many of these characters sound like gergman voice actors i've heard a thousand times?
<red_ony> Lil_B: brill moral
<Bronysith> BBBFF and Love is in bloom were awesome songs though...
<MadSurge> Dat unnecessary slow-mo
<Dark_Horst> i am very confused
<scout19_tf2> ded
<Thorn> HOLY SHIT KUNG FU HOOKER
<fluttercry> 05,15Ninjazz remember when it came out and everyone was like "ZOMG BEST EPISODE BEST SONG AHHHHHH"
<Canadian_Brony> Dark_Horst it's an English dub.
<Kotano> Dark_Horst Maybe they are 'better' with the accents?
<Dashie> what are your favorte mlp songs
<DerpStar> What happened to the fat guy?
<Dark_Horst> Canadian_Brony: i know. i still heard these voices before many times
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry I voted for Winter Wrap Up as best song..
<Lil_B> red_ony . . . erm ... no sorry, but I see no good in hurting someone
<JunkerKun> fluttercry: Not the best but still kind of good. I personally liked it
<Bronysith> fluttercry: yea, People only like this day aria because it is a villain song
<Bronysith> fucking hell
<Dark_Horst> Kotano: i'm havin that theory too
<Combustiblelemons> best songs are winter wrap up and smile smile smile.
<twilight_sprinkle> this day aria is best song though imo, and i could care less about the grammar nazis
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, could you blame them? End of the season, high expectations, big flashly lights, OOO SHINY effect.
<CrimsonPhoenix> This day aria was surprising for being the now only villain song in the whole series
<MadSurge> fluttercry: it's not the best episode, but it comes close. At least for me.
<Thorn> Imaginary fighting!
<J_E_Smith71> fluttercry: Well everyone here goes BEST EPISODE/BEST SONG the first time they play here
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> ouch
<J_E_Smith71> EVERY episode almost
<Kotano> Dark_Horst Which ones do you mean,though.I could make out Will Smith's german voice,anything else?
<DerpStar> Canadian_Brony: Its the best song after this Day, which really is in a league of its own
<Dark_Horst> for example, the guy in the yellow shirt. i'm deadsure he's a german VA. heard his voice many times in german dubs
<red_ony> Lil_B: I wasn't serious.. I share your thoughts on the episode
<shogipony> what is this?
<Combustiblelemons> Discord was a good villain
<Mega_Milk> eeyup
<cow334> i didnt think season two finaly was that great i liked it i just didnt like what they did when celestia went against chryasli there should have been a battle
<Combustiblelemons> wish he didn't give up so easily
<Mega_Milk> headphones are coming out.
<NoPonyEpic> its not very effective......
<fluttercry> 05,15Bronies have a tendency to declare everything fantastic when it first runs, then later go back on that
<Coldays> kung fu hustle
<Thorn> For when you cant afford the reall fight scene because of health issues and oh wait nevermind
<Lil_B> red_ony oh, sry I tend to take things to serious sometimes xD
<Bronysith> fluttercry: also, chrysallis is easily the most idiotic villain and worst villain of the series
<Ninjazz> I think that's the case for most people, fluttercry.
<Dark_Horst> Kotano: there were also some in the village at the beginningof the movie. but i dont know their anmes
<rdibp> hey guys im back
<Thorn> MORTAL KOMBAT
<Canadian_Brony> Ninjazz agreed
<MaxTheBrony> Wb rdibp :)
<Canadian_Brony> hi rdibp
<Invi> wb rdibp
<JunkerKun> Bronysith: Huh? Really
<BroHoof> welcome back rdibp
<rdibp> [aunch
<rdibp> paunch*
<Thorn> I'm sorry, I just saw the potential for that joke.
<Dark_Horst> Kotano: now that you say it, the will smith one could be the yellow shirt guy
<Combustiblelemons> I'd say she was indeed Bronysith
<scout19_tf2> oh shit
<red_ony> fluttercry: funnily enough I have problems with most episodes of mlp.. unlike for exaple the first two seasons of the power puff girls
<JunkerKun> Bronysith: I mean we don't have that much villains anyway
<fluttercry> 05,15The fact that I completely forgot about the S2 finale says a lot about it.
<Thorn> BOOB PAWNCH
<MadSurge> Why did this movie become a DBZ episode suddendly?
<DerpStar> Bronysith: She literally wanted to overthrow the monarchy and enslave the populace
<Kotano> Dark_Horst He had several roles in this
<Thorn> FINISH HIM
<cow334> is this movie almost done?
<Canadian_Brony> cow334 no
<rdibp> SPANK THAT STATUE
<Thorn> SHIT
<Dark_Horst> Kotano: recognized at least one other
<scout19_tf2> use the force asain lady
<cow334> Canadian_Brony: how much longer?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alright here we go
<Canadian_Brony> rdibp it's a bell
<rdibp> O_o
<Fl00t4hSh41> Slaneshi Noise Marines would be green with envy at using that...
<Mega_Milk> Why is she spanking the statue? XD
<Combustiblelemons> it's a bell.
<Coldays> there is still one more fight after this one
<SirGanjalf> oh snap..
<Bronysith> DerpStar: "Consuming your love made me more powerful than celestia" 5 seconds later "you trying to gain power with love? that wont work" =_=
<Ryunosuke> uh oh

<Tassadork> scream cannon
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<CrimsonPhoenix> CANTERLOCK BASS CANON
<Dark_Horst> OH FUCK
<Ninjazz> I'm wondering where the hell is the coherency. One moment it's about 3 masters, now it's about these 2.
<Mega_Milk> oh hell.......

<Sundaysmile> Don't follow Ninjazz, just enjoy the ride

<fluttercry> 05,15Okay, I did not like this movie. It relied too heavily on "OH SHIT EVERYTHING IS SO OVER THE TOP, LOOK AT ALL THIS COOL STUFF" The slapstick fell flat, the jokes were bad, the plot was incoherent. 4/10

<Tassadork> or maybe gross sleeves style...
<Dark_Horst> DerpyMuffins: movies liek this arent designed for story. it's a homage to all the cheak 70s kung fu b movies xD

<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry and that's why I love it. That, or because I saw this for the first, last, and only time I saw this movie (before today) was when I was 6-ish.
<Canadian_Brony> 9/10
<Ryunosuke> my only issue is that it clearly should have been a b movie as it was a parody of other b rated kung fu movies :)
<BroHoof> secret of my excess was it?
<Bogy> return of harmony after the 3 hours movie... i don't know if i can do this that long xDD
<Sundaysmile> oooo very nice choices
<Vash> 9/10 for comedy
<Ninjazz> I'm glad that somehow my connection is actually keeping up with stream.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: i tried voting it as a B, i was told its A
<BroHoof> Ninjazz: same here ._.
<fluttercry> 05,15It's the same reason why I disliked Kung Pow. The idea of "Weren't old Kung Fu movies awful, look at how awful they were" can only take you so far
<cow334> can any one type on name from the stream?
<Vash> Ninjazz, I know right? when is our internet that goof?
<cow334> Chanllege?
<RainbowAsh> Canadian_Brony, stop making me feel old ;_;
<Cypresswolf> :3 This moviei is Barbetos approved

<fluttercry> 05,15Budget and Critical reception
<Canadian_Brony> RainbowAsh then get the mods to stop making me feel young!
<Coldays> its awsome
<alexxm> well u kujed ut
<MaxTheBrony> dont question the almighty
<Ryunosuke> let me put it this way
<MaxTheBrony> move chooser
<SirGanjalf> Same thing here Caramel
<Tassadork> yeah, not oscar material or anything... but it is what it set out to be
<Fl00t4hSh41> Caramel: Only the gods know.
<MaxTheBrony> movie*
<Vash> Caramel becuase it was all a joke, one big parody
<Combustiblelemons> Seriously thought it was B
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<alexxm> well i liked it
<Caramel> 2,14 what was the budget? Because that didn't LOOK high budget
<Ninjazz> Okay. So how bout 2012 then?
<cow334> i like the movie with the guy in the box the whole time ^^
<Ryunosuke> if Hot Shots: Part Deux is be, this should clearly be b movie :)
<BroHoof> chinease credits how lovely
<Canadian_Brony> Should've been a B
<RaveBrony> Yeah
<fluttercry> 05,1510s of millions of dollars
<Forgottencrow> futter cry you make me sad i go jack off to clop porn :*( troll face
<pony_8407> i hope how Jappleack is doing
<red_ony> b movie night
<Combustiblelemons> welp, it was. they probably spent the rest on cocaine.
<cow334> O-o
<Caramel> 2,14 wow, they must have bought a lot of frappucinos
<Combustiblelemons> cocaine.
<RainbowAsh> Canadian_Brony, enjoy it while it lasts :p
<Coldays> realy
<JunkerKun> What is B and A-movie anyway?
<RaveBrony> Nows ponies and then B movie...Fuuuuuuu
*Bronysith glomps Caramel
<JunkerKun> I still can't feel the difference
<MaxTheBrony> I would say that A or B deppends how much you self was entertained by the movie , but it isnt like that :/
<MadSurge> Terry Pratchett *claps* :$
<fluttercry> 05,15ahh the ol ban hammer. It's been too long
<PinkieSpice> A movie rated above 5
<Ryunosuke> I felt it was b movie material due to cheesiness if anything
<Lil_B> coreografer Sammo Hung. No wonder fights looked good :)
<PinkieSpice> b movie rated 5 and below
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah But the rating Is subjective
<J_E_Smith71> pony_8407: She got shot up in the sky redy to take on Applelox
<Pinkies4thWall> BLARGH
<DashWithRainbows> fluttercry it isn't a good saturday if someone isn't banned :P
<Pinkies4thWall> Hi guys
<cow334> PONYS NOW
<Kencolt> Caramel: Very high for Hong Kong. Much more CGI than is the norm, some big name actors (Well over there) and also noted as possibly one of the greatest Wuxia parodies ever written-- again, to the tastes of Hong Kong. And me. I tend to agree with them.
<pony_8407> We can still save Derpy, from getting replace.
<MaxTheBrony> heya Pinkies4thWall :)

<MadSurge> Hello VenHur!
<LordDerpington> Squishy cheeeeeeks!
<Canadian_Brony> hi VenHur
<RainbowAsh> fluttercry, if Rarity just coerces Spike, why does she keep his gift in such high esteem? Her behavior at the end makes it clear, it's not just because of its material worth.
<Coldays> hat
<Ninjazz> So much for savouring that.
<MaxTheBrony> Dem sad Pony ears <3
<Canadian_Brony> later
<DerpStar> Hai VenHur
<nonody2> FWEE HAT
<J_E_Smith71> Gee I wonder why Cheerliee bought a pimp hat...
<Stary> I hear so much Celestia in Cheerilee, does anyone else?
<Applejack2012> this is how I made my fist ponyfic
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Alchemist> pimpi my dragon
<Star_Shadow> Why does Cheerilee have a pimp hat in her grocry bag?
<TrixieMuffins> SWAG-hat Cheerilee must become an official toy!
<SirGanjalf> Spike has found: Hustler's Hallmark
<scout19_tf2> BroHoof: i know but still its where it alllllllllllllllll started
<Kotano> nice pimp hat
<Stary> Ik they are the same VA and all
<DerpStar> And the Swag begins
<Sundaysmile> implying spike is a pony
<Combustiblelemons> I seriously want a pimpin' hat like that.
<Applejack2012> derpy
<Bogy> why did she bought that hat..
<Canadian_Brony> I want a hat like that
<LordDerpington> Spike's a smooth criminal.

<Coldays> evil spike
<APPLEBLOOM111> Lickety Split
<DerpStar> Pinkies4thWall: I'm not entirely sure she counts as a background pony
<Applejack2012> Lickety Split revived
<RainbowAsh> Pinkies4thWall, I think she has a few too many lines to be a true background pony. More of a minor supporting character imho.
<LordDerpington> Lickety Split was a G1 character. And female.
<DerpStar> More like a recurring character
<Bogy> oh spyke..
<Wrek> 05lickety split is best big mac ship
<J_E_Smith71> The reason why Cheerliee had a pimp hat, cause Cheerliee is a whooooore
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Applejack2012> lol
<APPLEBLOOM111> oh god...

<CrimsonPhoenix> I thought it was Allie Way
<TVNOOD> Hello?
<MaxTheBrony> bye for now
<fluttercry> 05,15RainbowAsh there's no way you can say there was a kiss. At all. It literally is impossible
<Canadian_Brony> hi TVNOOD. You're just in time for a 3 hour long movie!
<weccojecco> hey temme
<Sumica> 00,10hello TVNOOD
<TVNOOD> : D
<weccojecco> i meen tvnood
<Ponies47> Hey TVNOOD
<Canadian_Brony> grab some snacks cuz this is gonna take a while
<LordDerpington> Technically it's a TV miniseries edited together into a movie, but whatever.
<TVNOOD> So what is this movie about?
<Stormman3100> So whats next?
<Canadian_Brony> TVNOOD it's called "Colour of Magic" and . . . I actually have no idea what it's about.
<Sumica> 00,10it's about magic and it's color
<Canadian_Brony> Stormman3100 see aoveb
<Kotano> is it any good?
<Canadian_Brony> *above
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, fluttercy, all I know is they would never intentionally ship any of the mane 6 with each other, all the soccer moms would lynch the hasbro executives. Was it put in as an easter egg of sort? There is a slight probablity. More importantly, I never get why people get worked up about topics like this. It's just such a minor detail.
<Combustiblelemons> colourful magic.
<LordDerpington> An incompetent wizard who agrees to take a naive tourist on a tour around the sights of Discworld, and get into all sorts of scrapes along the way.
<APPLEBLOOM111> Mmmmm popcorn! :)
<Stormman3100> ah, just got back with mah food
<Canadian_Brony> Kotano it's a B movie that made it into Bronystate. Of course not >_>

<Tassadork> yep. intermission is indeed food time
<Kencolt> TVNOOD: About one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. Discworld. By Terry Pratchett. Think Lord of the rings meets HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy... but a lot funnier.
<Ponies47> Being a admin of a Steam group can sometimes be hard work. But it all pays off. Trust me :3
<fluttercry> 05,15From what I here, it's actually good. Just very long
<TVNOOD> Cool.
<Combustiblelemons> I was an admin once. It wasn't fun.

<Bajocontinuo> i think Half life 3 will be revealed the same day that the season 3 of mlp fim gets out

<MadSurge> Saturn: I like it too :$ only read a few of the books
<derpydoo> the transvestite from rocky horror
<LordDerpington> He was in Clue, which we've seen on Bronystate. And It, and Rocky Horror, and lot sof things.
*Saturn 08,01was never very interested in reading novels until he read Discworld
<Bajocontinuo> does anyone want to add me on steam?
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i read all of them by the time i was 16
<Coldays> sure i will
<Meanwhile> David Jason is best wizard.
<Vash> is it just me or does this movie seem to be skipping forward? is my stream just being weird?
<Ponies47> Yay I have no school Friday! :3
<Saturn> 08,01and bought the hardback of every new on ethat came out since then
<Bajocontinuo> :D
<Bajocontinuo> awesome

<Bajocontinuo> i am bajocontinuo2
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, maybe even about half of them
<Bajocontinuo> yep
<Lyon`> im amazing!
<Bajocontinuo> i LOVE tf2
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Coolzies!! :D
*Lyon` flexes
<Fl00t4hSh41> sounds like a lovely place
<LordDerpington> The first two Discworld books aren't really the best to start on though. They're good, just very different from the others. PTerry hit his stride in Mort though.
<Coldays> xx12coldaysxx
<Meanwhile> Vash: Skipping? Not on my end. Try refreshing.
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn I almost entirely avoided novels for a few years until I read a Xanth novel. DAMN those are funny!
<Saturn> 08,01LordDerpington: i started on Wyrd Sisters and Soul Music
<LordDerpington> Good ones, Saturn.
<Ponies47> TF2 is fun but I suck at it :P
<LordDerpington> Reaper Man was my first.
<Coldays> ^same here
<Bajocontinuo> i can show you to play better Ponies47
<SirGanjalf> My first novel was the Hogfather
<shogipony> same here
<[Alpha]> ...o.o
<Sweet_Tea> Saturn : I'm currently reading Mort :)
<MadSurge> Stuck atop of a Fluttershy :D
<derpydoo> mines was a crappy rip off of harry potter
<RainbowAsh> Snaaaake!
<PinkieSpice> darn it
<Pinkieshy_Dash> My steam refuses to load..
<MadSurge> And Death is waiting :D
<RainbowAsh> Badger Badger Badger Badger
<PinkieSpice> the stream is lagging for me
<Bajocontinuo> Ponies47 give me your steam username so that i can add you
<Ponies47> <- It's my Bstate nickname Bajocontinuo :P
<MadSurge> Death: please die kthx xoxo
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i only ever read short stories as a kid
<Saturn> 08,01until Discworld
<Meanwhile> Saved by the luggage.
<Bajocontinuo> Bstate??? what do you mean Ponies47?
<Saturn> 08,01because i'm a very slow reader, and I have ADHD
<[Alpha]> wtf?
<Coldays> what a twist
<Ninjazz> The luggage doubles as a coffin?
<derpydoo> you have adhd? didn't know that
<Ponies47> Bajocontinuo: Bronystate.
<DaringDerpy> Saturn: try dune...awesome material
<MadSurge> Saturn: I was a bookworm as akid
<Bajocontinuo> oooo
<Vash> ADHD? i have ADH- i love squirlls, oh hey i should learn to tango!
<Saturn> 08,01DaringDerpy: i've read Dune
<shogipony> are they still making discworld novles?
<Saturn> 08,01the first 3 books, anway
<Ponies47> I never read books
<DaringDerpy> they are still making new ones
<MadSurge> Saturn: how are they?
<Vash> but really, me too
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: fucking fantastic
<Saturn> 08,01everything LotR should have been
<shogipony> oooh joy
<MadSurge> Saturn: added to my list then :D
<Vash> Saturn , as good as a hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy novels?
<Saturn> 08,01but wasn't, because LotR is about as interesting to read as a shopping list
<MadSurge> Saturn: how so? :O
<Caramel> 2,14 in your opinion
<Saturn> 08,01John Major's shopping list.
<SirGanjalf> MadSurge: Me too. Ironically i lost my interest of books shortly after i started school
<Saturn> 08,01yes, in my opinion
<derpydoo> I like reading shopping lists though
<Caramel> 2,14 some people actually enjoy the book that began and inspired an entire generation of fantasy genres
<Saturn> 08,01i'm one of the few people who doesn't like it
<Bajocontinuo> I am trying to add you Ponies47 but steam is derping around
<RainbowAsh> SirGanjalf, school is generally very good at destroying interests in things.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just not a fan of the writing style, Caramel
<derpydoo> I despise lord of the rings though
<Vash> Saturn I completely agree with your opinion of LotR
<[Alpha]> I don't like the Hobbit
<Fl00t4hSh41> Caramel: don't be silly. Nobody ever read LOTR
<Bajocontinuo> now i think i got t
<flutterchu> oh hello Saturn
<Bajocontinuo> i reade LOTR!
<Canadian_Brony> I can't read LoTR. Too long and drones me out.
<Ponies47> Bajocontinuo: Your on mah friends list now :P
<Saturn> 08,01Caramel: it's undoubtedly an influential book, it's just not to my taste
<LordDerpington> I read it when I was 14!
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Uhm Bajocontinuo I can't add you cus I haven't got full membership...
<[Alpha]> Only LOTR book I read
<MadSurge> Saturn: what's the main difference?
<Bronysith> Ponies47: *you're
<Caumen> Howdy
<Ponies47> Bronysith: Ok smartass
<Sweet_Tea> Saturn : what are your opinions on the films?
<Meanwhile> Reading LoTR is very slow going. Good books though.
<MadSurge> Saturn: also yeah, LOTR can be very boring
<derpydoo> I hate how LOTR is so damn popular, it just takes so long to develop and even the supposed good parts are decent at best and are only few and far between for me
<RainbowAsh> I was never able to finish LOTR. Each time I try, around the time they talk around 70 pages about a campfire I get bored out of my mind.
<SirGanjalf> Fl00t4hSh41: You can't be a fantasy fan if you haven't read LotR. It's like baing a Christian without reading the Bible>_>
<SirGanjalf> *being
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Bajocontinuo, can you add me? I'm called pinkieshy_dash
<Bronysith> i read through LOTR 3 times
<alexxm> suffocation
<Bajocontinuo> of course i can!!!
<Bajocontinuo> and i will
<RainbowAsh> SirGanjalf, so you are saying most fantasy fans haven't read LOTR?
<Vash> his room was air tight except for the keyhole?
<MadSurge> And Death
<Fl00t4hSh41> SirGanjalf: the bible is a piece of hack writing anyway...<_<
<SirGanjalf> yep, that was dark
<Pinkieshy_Dash> ʸᵃʸ :D
<SirGanjalf> RainbowAsh: pretty much
<flutterchu> http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=Screenshot2012-10-16at70114PM_zps8eafa49e.png
<LordDerpington> Yes, Vash. The book was a bit clearer on that point.
<Caumen> I'm happy I'm not the only one that couldn't get around finishing reading the books
<Coldays> i added you Banjocontiinuo
<Saturn> 08,01Sweet_Tea: i didn't particularly enjoy the films either
<Ninjazz> Heresy.

<MadSurge> Saturn: did you see the terrible Dune film? :D
<Caumen> That's a mighty fine rock
<Ponies47> Coldays: I can add you. What's your Steam name?

<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i saw both the David Lynch film and the recent miniseries
<Saturn> 08,01there are good and bad points about both
<Vash> soo... why was his room air tight?
<LordDerpington> BladedWings: Yes, all day. It's busted on my ADSL connection, but fine via 3G. There's a router broken after the hop to New York, according to traceroute.
<Coldays> i just addded you and its xx12coldaysxx
<Fl00t4hSh41> RainbowAsh: You would be hard pressed to find egyptoligists who would agree
<Ninjazz> Ask and ye shall receive.

<PinkieSpice> we meet again
<Kotano> bye sonicdude558
<derpydoo> I tried reading through the lotr but Its so god damn long so the book stretches out too much so its like 100 pages of the characters talking about things useless to the story, but I do like the look of the new hobbit movie
<PinkieSpice> ah
<Ponies47> Bye sonicdude558
<SirGanjalf> psssssssssst
<BladedWings> LordDerpington: Southern Coastal Cable

<SirGanjalf> FunFact: Excalibur wasn't the sword that was cast in the stone. It was the one that Lady of the Lake gave to Arthur.
<Dark_Horst> did the sword say hogwarts?
<derpydoo> so is there any good american drama shows with a bit of comedy between like breaking bad and walking dead
<Meanwhile> Hey is that sword boiced by John Cleese?

<MadSurge> Transparent dragons!
<Chrysalis> transparant dragon?
<[Alpha]> active camo
<Ninjazz> So is she like Wonder Woman and that's her invisible dragon?
<Chrysalis> looks more like alpha issue
<Meanwhile> Dragons are see-through. That's a neat idea.
<[Alpha]> o.o
<bcb> its a patch
<Fl00t4hSh41> MadSurge: The damned lizard isn't real unless you believe in it
<weccojecco> 10/10
<Kencolt> Meanwhile: Oh, it's nothing like that at ALL... you'll see.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Hence being see through
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: that's why they can't see them!
<LordDerpington> The dragons fade as they get further from the Wyrmberg. That's why they aren't seen all over Discworld.
<Meanwhile> Dragonlady.
<Garettbrony> I love that Game
<bcb> bad dragon
<Fl00t4hSh41> LordDerpington: Its a fluke of the wyrmberg
<[Alpha]> This is a game?
<Garettbrony> Mortal Kombat!
<BladedWings> bcb: no
<Fl00t4hSh41> In the discworld there are proper dragons though
<LordDerpington> Very high magic field, see.
<Sweet_Tea> I gotta head off for now guyssss! ;_;
<Fl00t4hSh41> Once terrorises Ank Morpork in one of the books

<Fl00t4hSh41> And then theres the swarmp dragons
<bcb> bye
<Fl00t4hSh41> The size of a cat or small dog and prone to exploding
<LordDerpington> And they just burp stink, not fire.
<MadSurge> Guess who got one of the great spells, guys
<Kencolt> LordDerpington: Oh, they have fire, they do. Sam Vimes can attest to that.
<PinkieSpice> what his name
<Fl00t4hSh41> LordDerpington: Flamable gasses. Thats why they also explode when too excited
<PinkieSpice> the wizard with the sword
<RainbowAsh> Rincewind
<Meanwhile> Twoflower is very naive.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: indeed
<RainbowAsh> Meanwhile, he is a tourist
*[Alpha] rolls eyes,''Tourists"
<Wrek> 05oh my god nachos are delicious
<Fl00t4hSh41> Meanwhile: He IS an idio... I mean TOURIST

<Wrek> 05got cheese, creme fraice, grinded tacho spiced meat and salsa
<Ninjazz> Twoflower gets ALL the luck.
<MadSurge> Dat dragon likes Twoflowers
<Meanwhile> I guess he's entitled to it after he helped carry Frodo up Mount Doom.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: of course, Rincewind is a butt monkey :D
<bcb> :D
<Ninjazz> That doesn't excuse his terrible choice in clothing.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: but, tourist clothes!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, his misfortunes are entertaining to watch though.
<flutterchu> ~i tried my best to block out the screams. but there haunting me in my dreams~
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: Thats how tourists dress
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, statement stands.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: yep :D

<Garettbrony> she looks like zeetha from girl genius
<BladedWings> [Alpha]: whats wrong?
<flutterchu> RainbowAsh: i was just singing.....because im bored
<SirGanjalf> That sword is soooo like Lilarcor
<Ninjazz> It's all the sword.
<RainbowAsh> flutterchu, but, magic sword fight
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<LordDerpington> Pinkieshy_Dash: Rincewind and Twoflower have been captured by the dragon lords and imprisoned in the Wyrmberg, an upside-down mountain. The strong magic field there means that if you imagine dragons they take physical form.
<flutterchu> RainbowAsh: whatever
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> whats this?
<bcb> IVE GOT THE POWER!!!
<doctor_whooves127> heman
<Meanwhile> Oh I see, dragons appear in the Wyrmberg because of...wow that's cool.
<Ponies47> Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
<MadSurge> Sketch_Toku_Brony: The Colour of Magic
<Ninjazz> Oh Twoflower, you always had a way with the wyrmkinesses.
<Pinkieshy_Dash> LordDerpington, ouh, thanks .-. I didn't expect anyone would actually do it... You earned a muffin :P
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: bow chika w-ah, nevermind
<Meanwhile> If only Sam could've summoned a dragon to fly the ring to Mordor...
<twilight_sprinkle> LordDerpington: i thought only dragon lords could summon them though
<Fl00t4hSh41> Dat CGI dragon
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, you never know...
<Eli> goooood.... spring rolls with apple sauce was one of my best ideas yet :)
<SirGanjalf> Lvl 1 Mage on a flying mount?
<LordDerpington> twilight_sprinkle: In the book, it clarifies that you have to really *believe* in dragons to do it, not just imagine them.
<[Alpha]> Bye sword :P
<bcb> damn tourists.....
<Dashie> giggity
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol wha?
<twilight_sprinkle> okay LordDerpington
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: why? He did fine without it. Shame Frodo survived :D
<Kotano> I don't think I'll make it through the whole movie.I'll probably see some of you next week.
<Kotano> bye
<LordDerpington> There was no way they would have included the aeroplane bit in this adaptation. It was seriously random.
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: would've gone much quicker though.
<[Alpha]> he fell asleep
<SirGanjalf> well, shit
<bcb> shame
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah man that sword reminded me of Dave the Barbarian :D funny show

<Eli> Ninjazz: ... ...

<Pinkieshy_Dash> I'm starting to believe this movie has no end, amIright?
<Ninjazz> Eli, best not to google Bad Dragon then.
<Wheew> traps r fun!
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: Bad Dragon requires a REALLY high tollerace for bad/bizzare porn though
<Eli> Ninjazz: i did
<Ninjazz> Eli, don't say I didn't warn you.
<Eli> Ninjazz: you did...
<Ninjazz> Fl00t4hSh41, it wasn't that bad. I've seen worse really.

<SirGanjalf> Meanwhile: That's worth a shot
<pankreas> necronomicon is best book
*Ish opens the Necronomicon with ease
<MadSurge> I'm going out for a while now. See you later ponies!

<derpydoo> Peter griffin voice "HE SAID IT"
<BladedWings> dat title drop
<adasdad> aww, no sea troll ;(
<[Alpha]> boat
<adasdad> or not?
<Meanwhile> Invi: Probably because he didn't publish it, it's a commemorative edition.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Of course two flower can't see the 8th colour. Only wizards can
<adasdad> incoming sea troll??
<Fl00t4hSh41> its what makes them wizards
<Ninjazz> Twoflower just bleeds good fortune.
<adasdad> ninjazz: but he's not asian in this, so i hate him.
<[Alpha]> I name it...Equestria :P
<Pinkieshy_Dash> Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my AAGH
<PinkieSpice> how the f is this a b movie?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> anyone else bummed out about the SH HD Collection? :S makes me wanna save up to make a gaming PC and play the originals
<Ninjazz> adasdad, not even for Samwise the Brave?
<Meanwhile> The Legend of Luggage should be it's own movie.
<Wrek> 05PinkieSpice: B movie =/= bad movie
<Ish> They should make all the Discworld books into films
<adasdad> Meanwhile: i would watch the exrement out of that.
<red_ony> Sketch_Toku_Brony: why would you need a new pc for this?
<Pinkieshy_Dash> PinkieSpice because it's so looong
<PinkieSpice> Wrek: I know. But this should be an A movie
<RainbowAsh> PinkieSpice, wasn't released in cinema, and technically it's not a movie, since it's actually two.
<PinkieSpice> oh
<PinkieSpice> is both part being played?
<RainbowAsh> PinkieSpice, yes
<Starlight_Phoenix> its a b movie probably because its a tv movie
<Invi> Meanwhile, he just wrote the history and the chronology of the necronomicon, not the book. he just mentioned it several times
<PinkieSpice> yay
<[Alpha]> I spy with my little eye
<adasdad> meh, the boks where a lot better, and this isn't very true to the source material.
<Ninjazz> I'm probably going to skip the second part. It's already 7:30am.
<Ponies47> Ninjazz: Go to bread...
<Bjornfot> Hello friends~
<[Alpha]> and a miss
<Ponies47> Hey Bjornfot
<Meanwhile> Invi it's just called The Necronomicon. It's just a collection of his writing.
<Ish> Did I mention I finally got that which I have sought out for ages
<[Alpha]> He sounds like Nigel thornberry
<Ninjazz> Ponies47, after this part. Or when the buffers got to the point where I can't tollerate them any more.
<Ish> [Alpha] Tim Curry voices Nigel Thornberry
<[Alpha]> Thank you
<Ponies47> Ninjazz: Good idea :P
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> red_ony: well the pc im using is REALLY old and i would want to make a good gaming pc sometime next year so i can get into pc gaming like TF2 ect.
<Ish> [Alpha] so in a way that is Nigel Thornberry
<red_ony> Sketch_Toku_Brony: you could always buy a ps 2
<red_ony> Sketch_Toku_Brony: on the cheap
<Ponies47> My new computer runs TF2 like a boss. I wub it <3
<scout19_tf2> im back and i c ur all watching toviehe none stop m
<pankreas> Sketch_Toku_Brony the old SH Games run very good on my 6 year old laptop, so go on and play ;)
<Invi> Meanwhile, it is? can you PM me the ISBN number?
*Bjornfot glomps Ish
<scout19_tf2> typo
<SirGanjalf> Sketch_Toku_Brony: You should do it before Sony/MS releases next console.
<PinkieSpice> reminds me of the game magics
*Ish punchs Bjornfot
<Dark_Horst> scout19_tf2: english please
<Meanwhile> Invi: Maybe, what's an ISBN number?
<Ninjazz> OH YEAH! Tim Curry was also the Soviet Premier in Command and Conquer Red Alert 3! That's what I've been trying to remember.
<[Alpha]> A book that can fight ....sweet
<PinkieSpice> the game magicka*
<adasdad> dat krull
<SirGanjalf> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Cause the graphic requirements will probably rise again after it.
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: a number that identifies a book
<pankreas> Invi, go to amazon and search for necronomicon
*Bjornfot is a master of kung fu so he dodges Ish's punch and kicks his ass
<RainbowAsh> Meanwhile, it's a code that you can use to reference any book ever published
<Meanwhile> The more you know.
<adasdad> THEY GOT HER SKIN COLOR WRONG
<SirGanjalf> Sketch_Toku_Brony: And so the hardware prices
<Fl00t4hSh41> Is that Zoe from firefly?
*Ish is a master of something and dodges Bjornfot's kicks
<adasdad> BLEEEAUUAUEEG NITPIUCK
<Invi> Meanwhile, the isbn number is sth like a book ID. it should be uder the barcode of the book
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SirGanjalf: for the new console? or do ya mean the parts for a pc?
<Meanwhile> Invi: Alright, hang on.
<Ish> Bjornfot no Moleste
<RainbowAsh> Since when can Rincewind fight?
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: every book has an isbn number that identifies it without any doubt, it's a global databank thingie
*Canadian_Brony is a master of duct tape and ductapes Ish and Bjornfot together
<adasdad> RainbowAsh: since when is twoflower not asian?
<Wrek> 05a wonder that a chest filled with gold can swim
<Canadian_Brony> Now STFU or I'll tape your mouths shut
*Ish avoids the ductape
<Wrek> 05als
*Bjornfot molests Wrek
<Wrek> 05o
<Dark_Horst> it's a chest of wodners
<RainbowAsh> Wrek, maybe it just walks on the ground. Alternatively: Magic
<Wrek> 05No RP
<PinkieSpice> twoflower does seem to be lucky
<[Alpha]> :P
<Fl00t4hSh41> Wrek: More so than that it can walk?
<SirGanjalf> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I mean, you'll need to invest more in PC hardware to get graphics like on(nextgen) gonsoles
<Bjornfot> ooops :3
<Ish> inb4 Bjornfot is kicked
<[Alpha]> :|
<MecidTheGermanBrony> Whats this
<Ponies47> Agreed Ish
<SirGanjalf> *consoles

<adasdad> MecidTheGermanBrony: discworld movie. based very poorly on the great sries by terry pratchett.
<Invi> Meanwhile, thankies ^^
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350761519438.jpg Sumica
<Meanwhile> Yw
<scout19_tf2> how long is till the ending
<adasdad> i do like hgow they did krull, at least.
<Pinkieshy_Dash> scout19_tf2 4 days
<Pinkieshy_Dash> probably
<RainbowAsh> adasdad, when you don't know the source material, this movie is enjoyable though
<Ponies47> scout19_tf2: Were still on the first part
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith I am more than okay with that
<twilight_sprinkle> scout19_tf2: 2 hours or so
<Ponies47> I think...
<Fl00t4hSh41> scout19_tf2: We're barely half way
<Kencolt> adasdad: Not really fair. Prqatchett himself worked and approved this. Remember, the first book was more a collection of stories.
<LordDerpington> Well, just over 90 mins.
<adasdad> RainbowAsh: fair enough, but i can't help but go rabbid fanboy on it >.>
<Pinkieshy_Dash> can't we just watch the 2nd part another time >.<
<[Alpha]> Ha I knew it
<LordDerpington> I'd say this is a passable but unambitious adaptation. It's okay.
<[Alpha]> Called it
<Meanwhile> Why does it matter what gender the turtle is.
<scout19_tf2> Pinkieshy_Dash: lol 4 days
<SirGanjalf> Meanwhile: Because Science
<LordDerpington> Meanwhile: in case they meet another space-turtle.
<RainbowAsh> Meanwhile, what if it is going to mate?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SirGanjalf: oh i see well i wasnt gonna play stuff like games out now i was gonna play games like SH 3-4 or TF2 and other games,i was look up some how to stuff and see if there are tutorials on budgets (2-500$),ya know what i mean right? :$
<Fl00t4hSh41> Meanwhile: But thats one of the greatest scientific questions of our era
<Pinkieshy_Dash> scout19_tf2 well it might BE 2 hours, but it sure feels like 4 days
<Ish> that guy reminds me of Michael Palin for some reason
<Meanwhile> Nice face.
<BladedWings> dat face
<Pinkieshy_Dash> teletubbies!
<SirGanjalf> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I understand. Anyway 500$ PC should easily run most of today's games
<[Alpha]> XD
<LordDerpington> ook
<Meanwhile> Librarian is best orangutan.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SirGanjalf: :) cool lol though im short on cash this year so im gonna get started next year hopefully :$
<Fl00t4hSh41> Meanwhile: Oook
<scout19_tf2> well i gots to go cya everypony:) good luck watching the movie
<Bjornfot> Librarians in Metro 2033... D:
<BladedWings> bye scout19_tf2
<CrimsonPhoenix> " Life's too bleak to be just a solo. Even when I'm entirely alone, I can still hear the band playing on."
<Eli> what was noise?
<SirGanjalf> Bjornfot: What about them? ...Oh wait, i don't want to know - i didn't finish the book yet.
<Meanwhile> That is one cheesed off book.
<Bjornfot> SirGanjalf: Without spoiling anything I can say that they are... unpleasant.
<[Alpha]> they keep getting higher XD
<PinkieSpice> the world is explanding/
<Meanwhile> Do none of them know teleport spells?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Meanwhile: Those are insanely dangerous
<[Alpha]> that chest is midly disturbing
<Wrek> 05silly computer
<Metronome> inb4 WTF comments
<Fl00t4hSh41> Meanwhile: you have to account for the speed of the entire disc, its rotation and momentum when teleporting
<Meanwhile> Well at least they're clever about it.
<Fl00t4hSh41> its easy to endup going several hundred kilometers per second in the wrong direction
<Ann> What... what are we watching here?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ann: Discworld
<Ish> Ann Colour of Magic
<DerpyMuffins> ded
<SirGanjalf> Bjornfot: Thanks, i'm in the middle of the book at the moment
<Pinkieshy_Dash> asleep
<Ann> Ah, thank you.
<twilight_sprinkle> >powerful and clever mage
<SirGanjalf> aaand ded
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ah, the old fashioned promotions are the best
<twilight_sprinkle> >gets pushed
<twilight_sprinkle> died
<Meanwhile> Why did he not just shoot him in the face with his own dagger.
<Fl00t4hSh41> so much lag...
<Meanwhile> Seriously, what was the point of leaving him alive to promote further attempted backstabbing?
<Pinkieshy_Dash> cus love and tolerate Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Pfft, yeah right.
<Invi> becazuse it is a movie just with passive violence :§
<SirGanjalf> A'tuin genitalia - so pretty
<Ninjazz> Because silly authors.
<twilight_sprinkle> yes this movie couldve been a lot shorter
<Fl00t4hSh41> Meanwhile: because anyone else promoted to his job would be just as backstabbing
<Ann> Does that guy ever play a non-evil role?
<BladedWings> Tim Curry you evil bastarrd :D
<Meanwhile> Ann: He did in Clue.
<Fl00t4hSh41> backstabbing is a wizard tradition at this point in the discworld

Not pretty. The unseen university is mainly there to keep wizzards placid and docile so theydont screw up the world too much.

<Meanwhile> flutterchu: I thought you were incredibly annoying. Oh wait.
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: They didn't fall far or fast enough to make atmospheric friction a serious problem
<flutterchu> :'(
<Vash> SirGanjalf calm down people, your just shouting rabble!
<Fl00t4hSh41> not like it is in a normal orbital reentry on earth
<BladedWings> mmm, Christopher Lee? to wikapedia
<Ann> Wait... didn't Terry Pratchet write this? It's all coming together now.
<Ninjazz> Fl00t4hSh41, excuse me?

<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: to orbit the earth you need to go 6000 or more meters per second
<Ann> Do not worry about the changes. The changes will continue!
<cow334> this movie.....THIS SUCKS ON ICE
<CriticKitten> The council of red gandalfs
<Katalenic> cow334 u.u
<Vash> cow334 it gets better, trust me, also, if you dont like it, don't watch
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: That's what causes the atmospheric friction on rentry when you break from that kind of speed
<Canadian_Brony> cow334 why do you think I'm not watching it?
<Ninjazz> Fl00t4hSh41, I'm not sure if I said anything to relate to anything about orbiting...
<cow334> Katalenic: what...
<Meanwhile> Luggage wants to see the world.

<cow334> Canadian_Brony: good idea
<Meanwhile> A fresh 'orse.
<Ann> Are they good?
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: Simple thing is they didn't go fast enough to catch fire from reentry
<Vash> conan references everywhere
<Fl00t4hSh41> Ninjazz: also the spell likely protected them
<cow334> Katalenic: i like the turtle
<Socks> alexxm Mort is one of my fave's :)
<Coldays> cohen

<Canadian_Brony> cow334 I popped the chat and opened up a game of Poker Night at the Inventory on my PC with Borderlands 2 on the side.
<Fl00t4hSh41> cohen gets the heroic sound track, no matter what he does
<Ninjazz> Fl00t4hSh41, ...alright then. Still don't know if I said anything relating to orbiting and falling.
<Ann> Yeah go Borderlands 2
<Socks> All hail the toiletries!
<Meanwhile> Hot water, good dentisty and soft lavatory paper. These are the greatest of things.

<BladedWings> Socks: he was also Count Dooku
<CaesarAugustus> Da fuck is this I'm watching?

<SirGanjalf> Ninjazz: or sth like that:$
<Socks> Bladed wings: Yeah, I'm a big Chris Lee fan, and he probably is best known as Dooku
<Ninjazz> Him. Voice filter makes him sound like a lich.
<Meanwhile> Kencolt: The joke was that you're both the same age, but sure I'll take it.
<Ann> That Death is a friendly and helpful chap.
<Ninjazz> SirGanjalf, I think you got it right the first time.

<Socks> *super squee*
<SirGanjalf> Vash: He feels pretty good as a Orangutan in later books IIRC
<Fl00t4hSh41> Vash: Its just one of the occupational hazzards of working with magic in the discworld
