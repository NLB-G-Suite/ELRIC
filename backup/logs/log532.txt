<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: it'S on steam, not too expensive. you should look up dayZ sometime. livestreams, let's plays, lots of them out there. the is so poular, it rose the sells of the game by 500%

<Rainfall_Night> what happend
<AgentKalim> Everyone seems to be talking about dayZ lately. :P
<NewDCD> 09,01Hey guys
<Kandarihu> I'm not talking about Madoka Magica. Awesome series, though. But I'm talking about the game about wizards fighting monsters and each other.
<presentfactory> you killed it
<icybeauti> Cyrokinisis
<panda> NewDCD hi!
<icybeauti> Heya NewDCD
<xxMoopyxx> what
<AgentKalim> Hello, NewDCD
<NewDCD> 09,01it's shameless DCD-self-promotion time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi NewDCD

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Dead
<owloysius> New DCD is out today
<Meanwhile> NewDCD: That's every time.
<Kandarihu> Hmm, stream is lagging
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> streams dead
<panda> NewDCD shameless? You has shame ^-^
<K_A> Heh, my colleague at work mentioned Day Z to me.
<Narolas> AgentKalim: Tried it, if you go past the horrible clunky controls of arma 2, it's a ton of fun with friends
<otakon> hiya NewDCD
<icybeauti> what's Day Z
<Dark92Enigma> Time for a PPPPPPPPRRRRRRRRRRROMOTION
<Kandarihu> I refreshed. It seems better now.
<xxMoopyxx> brb
<otakon> okay guys I'll be back gotta clear my cache
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yeah refreshed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wednesday is Day Z.
<K_A> icybeauti: Mod of an armed forces simulator of a zombie-induced apocalypse.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Nittany_Discord: wats that?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My internet is derping.
<Devonx25> Spitfire!. What u doin!?.
<icybeauti> K_A: Ah. We can use that.
<NewDCD> 09,01anybody looking to buy a Steam account? I have one here that's worth $780 and I'm selling it for $300. That's 60% of a discount! Or if you know anybody who might want to, well, point them at me. I kind of need the money to make something really awesome I'm sure all of you would enjoy.
<Rainfall_Night> 10 hours
<FallenLegacy> tell her he died
<K_A> NewDCD: Dayum
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat midgit
<presentfactory> 300$ holy crap
<K_A> All I have on Steam are a couple games. :x
<Kandarihu> Um, is that legal?
<icybeauti> How long have you been streaming Nittany_Discord
<panda> NewDCD damn.... i dunno... im broke atm
<K_A> And I don't even play TF2 that much.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> NO NAKED SPITFIRE!!!
<NewDCD> 09,01it goes against the TOS but breaking TOS is not illegal
<K_A> And one of them was a gift from you guys. XD
<AgentKalim> After two days of watching this, the chat is no longer reacting much. :P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> nope
<SocksandPonies> Socks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If only Steam allowed sales.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve could take a cut from game resales.
<icybeauti> everyone sounds like they're from New York in 60's shows...
<AgentKalim> I know, innit grand?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I guess publishers would go apeshit like they do with Gamestop.
<Devonx25> how is steam account worth money? can get 1 4 free.
<icybeauti> I love it though. Makes the shpws more homelike for me.
<Kandarihu> Well, this is a parody of police shows from the 1950s-1970s
<presentfactory> it has game son it
<presentfactory> I bet
<owloysius> Devonx25: the games on it have a purchase value of $760
<owloysius> i guess?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: seriously i dont like how they get flank flustered over pre owned games
<Devonx25> oh.
<Dark_Horst> yeah... they suffer from that elusion they still own the game after you boguth it
<Dark_Horst> fuckers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But there's a market in game resale the doesn't involve punishing used game buyers.
<Dark_Horst> and then they wonder why people pirate
<Devonx25> i just download games for free.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: I know.
<keystroke> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's lost revenue. All they see is Gamestop getting rich from their work.
<icybeauti> Devonx25: I do that all the time for my kindle
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't get started.
<AgentKalim> Somehow, I missed seeing the waiting room every time :P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> please dont
<icybeauti> dem orthodontix
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But Valve could work something out to allow digital resales.
<cachi01> Devonx25: undead patch?
<Devonx25> ?.
<cachi01> its a hack for steam
<Dark_Horst> i remember this gamestop thing being discussed in here at least 3 times already B)
<keystroke> best receptionist ever.
<NewDCD> 09,01alternatively, if someone just reaaaaaaaaally wants to help me, instead of selling the Steam account, I'll use it as collateral as someone loans me the cash. I'd pay back little by little at the interest rate you propose, if that's the case
<sagas[A]> why are we using weemi now?
<sagas[A]> veemi
<SocksandPonies> Dat sucking
<K_A> In terms of console gaming, I generally don't like buying used unless I have a quality check like with Amazon's collectible ratings. I *HATE* scratched disks.
<NewDCD> 09,01but I'm kind of in a bind and need the money to get something important rolling
<Meanwhile> God damn why is it so hot in here.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Meanwhile: summer?
<Bronysith> sorry Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> I hate summer.
<AgentKalim> Maybe it's just you :P

<flutter_spin> wut?
<Dken2021> looks like someone modded the pyro's flamethrower
<LightNight> i am not suicidal or anything but i wish this life would either change or end
<flutter_spin> LOL
<AttackWithHugs> MahBoi777: It looks VERY colorful for Doomsday. I imagined it to be...dark...and industrial-ish
<MuffinsPrime> flutter_spin you've never heard of Team Fortress 2?
<flutter_spin> I've heard of it. I'm trying to figure out the mods
<MahBoi777> AttackWithHugs: all thanks to Pyrovision XD
<Alchemist> LightNight: do you try to change it?
<AttackWithHugs> MahBoi777: Good ol' Pyrovision
<flutter_spin> So far I know "party cannon"
<flutter_spin> I can't tell the rest
<MahBoi777> indeed, Pyrovicion is best vision
<MuffinsPrime> This is all for the new Meet the Pyro that came out
<LightNight> i cant see the fun in this world perspective
<AttackWithHugs> So I'm guessing it's a CP map?
<flutter_spin> Rarity?
<CCCP> CP?
<CCCP> WHAT?

<CCCP> awt I think i may be a doctor!!!!!!!!!??
<superretroworld> LightNight: same
<flutterchu> am i the only one who thinks that the lyra plushie is a cider cup holder
<Alchemist> flutterchu: you are wrong. Its a horn warmer.
<Dken2021> flutterchu I like to keep that mindset
<MuffinsPrime> It's an arrow quiver
<LightNight> i don't think I could find fun in anything the only thing i do often is play video games and that is just to make the time pass
<LightNight> i wouldnt even define it as fun
<superretroworld> i think the noticed that one of the ponies on the eq banner has a cutie mark of yoshi
<flutterchu> mabye i dont want to think about it anymore
<flutterchu> meet the pyro worst one yet
<flutterchu> i mean worst one
<CCCP> flutterchu: liked it aloooooot
<sagas> flutterchu: :O
<Dken2021> LightNight it's up to you in the end, if you want some happiness, nothing wrong with that, but it all depends how much you want change
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Meet The Pyro was great
<flutter_spin> awwwww, what happened?
<CCCP> SaxyPretender: i agree
<sagas> Meet the Pyro was probably my favorite
<flutterchu> CCCP: to ambarrasing for me
<LightNight> i dont get it
<AttackWithHugs> My class thought Meet the Pyro was funy.
<MahBoi777> SaxyPretender: definitely
<CCCP> flutterchu: :P
<MuffinsPrime> flutterchu strange way of spelling "BEST EVER"
<LightNight> Dken2021: wat do you mean
<flutterchu> CCCP: like whatever
<sagas> SaxyPretender: indeed it was
<Alchemist> LightNight: I was like that for a long time. Then I got "lucky". I found something I like with passion and pursue that. It seems thats what you need. Something you are passionate about.
<Sweetie_Belle> it says its offline :(
*CCCP hugs flutterchu
<Dken2021> LightNight you make your own fun, don't try to be dependant on others
<LightNight> i cant have fun alone
<flutterchu> CCCP: pleeeeeeeeeeease dont hug me :(
<sagas> The pure insanity in Meet the Pyro was just great
<flutter_spin> odd. I can't fun alone either.

<flutter_spin> I'm confused.
<Umbreon> i think the only script on this one is rukario
<flutter_spin> oh well
<Dken2021> LightNight college helps with that, though that depends if you have something else planned
<superretroworld> LightNight: you and me and similar lifes, but i do have a therapist and it helps me a little, try that
<flutter_spin> Naw, its just that I never 'got' TF2. I never found it fun :(
<Alchemist> LightNight: It couldnt hurt.

<LightNight> ya but it wouldnt be embarassing it is something that every person could have
<flutter_spin> I like hearing ponies freak out
<Alister> CCCP: So what ? animals eat themselves , the unwillingness to eat one out fo pity shows emotional weakness
<Umbreon> D:
<sagas> Dead animals are best animals to eat
<CCCP> Dken2021: i guess :s

<sagas> AttackWithHugs: So how long is this gonna last?
<CCCP> Alister: i HAVE MUCH emotional weakness, like a pidgen that has no wings

<Alister> nvm
<Ingwaz> superretroworld: thats what ponies are for
<SolairePony89> 'Ello CCCP
<Ingwaz> hey, its good ol' CCCP
<LightNight> i swear i always know the answers to things, I always know why things happen certain ways and know how to solve my issues or challenges, I can learn anything concrete but abstract things like (fun, love, selflessness) all seem fake and not understandable or relatable
<Shamroc> SaxyPretender: oi you should be glad i noticed that
<superretroworld> Ingwaz: true, but i have to admit, sometimes im jealous of there friendship
<Alister> sagas: I consider myself more of a Libertarian than a Darwinist

<flutter_spin> *just watched meet the pyro*
<flutter_spin> Everything... sort of makes sense now in the game
<sagas> Alister: Ah so youre Libertarian. That is a rather socially darwinistic. You dont want people to recieve aid or help
<Ingwaz> LightNight: the problems of an analytical mind
<Dken2021> flutter_spin and now you know
<Alister> sagas: I do like heloing others , but I don't want to force people to help others if they don't want too. Freedom is my ultimate desire
<LightNight> how do i fix it
<Alchemist> all my vices are devices :D
<Alister> sagas: Helping*
<flutter_spin> it was funny for about 5 seconds, until the guys starting screaming in terror
<ingwaz> superretroworld: well, equestria is a very ideal place, so in many cases, the things in there are ideals as well
<flutter_spin> Then it wasn't funny anymore
<Dken2021> LightNight like I said, no need fro self pity, it would make things worse
<sagas> Alister: Im talking as in having people recieve aid from the federal govt and other social services
<Alister> sagas: That is specifically what I dislike
<HyperMetalLugia> We like cancelled the movie channels here to save money on our cable bill
<LightNight> its not rlly pity i just know my flaws and am trying to find how to fix them
<LightNight> i kno that i am negative
<HyperMetalLugia> since we're using Amazon stream and other sites

<drf|laptop> 03but yeah
<ingwaz> LightNight: its not necessarily about fixing your flaws, everyone has flaws. its honestly about accepting them as part of who you are, but working on them as well in order to improve yourself
<drf|laptop> 03all 3 of those get recorded a lot and put up on hdbits :P

<flutter_spin> that was kind of good
<ingwaz> superretroworld: an ideal world would indeed be nice...sadly our world is far from ideal
<drf|laptop> 03oh yeah, this was also after the invention of The Cleveland Show (which sucks btw)
<Dken2021> man, it's been like a month since I watch a pony episode
<sagas> Alister: I dont expect you to lie and I wouldnt want you too :)
<LightNight> superretroworld: i agree equestria seems like my utopia and i use abstratc and virtual means to escape wat is reality since I cannot find happyness and something that I can find fun
<Alister> sagas: Thank you for understanding
<ingwaz> Alister: i do not consider it lying. I may withhold my opinions in certain situations in order to not offend or start an argument
<sagas> Alister: Any time :)
<flutter_spin> Dken2021: eh. I write on my mlp story everyday
<hen3ry> the system is du
<Alister> ingwaz: But if I'm asked , I will say what I think to my fullest
<superretroworld> ingwaz: ik, too bad it isnt real
<ingwaz> Alister: well, if someone outright asks your opinion on something, then yeah, they asked
<superretroworld> LightNight: same
<flutter_spin> Why do I suddenly have an urge to join them
<superretroworld> one day pinkie will destroy it http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0abdb1e40747ab08a72a571b71e7fe38/119693%20-%204th_wall%20brony%20fluttershy%20hug%20hugs%20macro%20mane_6%20meme%20pinkie_pie%20pony%20rainbow_dash%20rarity%20twilight_sparkle.jpg
<ingwaz> superretroworld: it sucks, but getting stuck on the want of an ideal world sucks too. will make you very negative and pesamistic
<CCCP> superretroworld: O_O

<drf|laptop> 03sure
<superretroworld> ingwaz: ikr?
<Alister> There is no point in saying this world is doomed , try to make good everyday you can , if you have the opportunity m take it.

<Alister> I don't get it
<sagas> Alister: Song sad lyrics Im listening to
<LightNight> ingwaz: i don't think for me and myabe superretroworld that we r really searching for the ideal world I think it is more we realize how unideal our world is after influence from shows like mlp

<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<junh1024-XD> School of Rock actually
<HyperMetalLugia> Should have guessed
<Alister> Well , of course the world won't be good for you if only complain , you have the possiblity to make good around you.
<HyperMetalLugia> Is it 5.1 supahsurround chnl edit
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Shamroc> SaxyPretender: he so startin
<flutter_spin> oh and Ninjazz, it might not be what you wanted, but you are now "Day Star" brother of "Night Star" , protector of Cloudsdale
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Shamroc, call him a slag
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender you're a slag.
<Dken2021> Alister like this guy I had in high school said: be the change you want to be in the world
<junh1024-XD> the movie was always in 5.1
<Ninjazz> flutter_spin: Sounds good! In the end, all I really wanted was a role. ^^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nono, Meanwhile, it is you who is the slag. because you're starting
<flutter_spin> hehe
<junh1024-XD> most movies from 1990+? are
<flutter_spin> being the inspiration for the idea, eh?
<Alister> Dken2021: Thank you , this expresses what I'm trying to say perfectly
<HyperMetalLugia> Rly?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<LightNight> i couldnt care less if it were ponies, kittens, puppies but wat remains the same is the reason i enjoy these things is that they seem to contain a aspect of something i enjoy
<superretroworld> well ideal world or no ideal world, we want to thank Lauren Faust for making out lives, just a little brighter
<HyperMetalLugia> I haven't ever noticed o-o
<LightNight> ^
<junh1024-XD> you didn't care because you only had 2 speakers
<junh1024-XD> amirite?
<flutter_spin> And yes, I found a way to get Mr. Sith a minor role in the 3rd fanfic too
<HyperMetalLugia> or I didn't see it in the menus
<HyperMetalLugia> but yah
<junh1024-XD> i didn't care about surround sound either, until i fixed by soundcard a year ago
<flutter_spin> I don't know. If it wasn't ponies, I would have definitely found something else to preoccupy me
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: yer a slag.
<flutter_spin> Using money on items seems... pointless?
<LightNight> nobody here can say that they act exactly how they truely are
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Meanwhile: stop starting.
<HyperMetalLugia> Did you upgrade a driver?
<LightNight> everyone is a slave to the constructs of society
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: start stoppin
<LightNight> there is no way out
<LightNight> no way to make it better
<junh1024-XD> nah, i just bunped some plugs
*sagas "I've seen your flag on the marble arch, love is not a victory march, it's a cold and its a broken Hallelujah" :'(
<LightNight> ppl find artificial happyness in work that seems ur choice
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Slagwhile, better start starting to stop so he can stop his starting
<Ninjazz> All in all a good use of time to me, flutter_spin. :3
<LightNight> but in the end u have to -choose- something
<HyperMetalLugia> Also, apparently turning on VLC spatiliser/whatever + adjustments fixes the low speech issues I was having
<LightNight> this creates anxiety for ppl like me
<LightNight> who don't know wat to choose
<LightNight> i am confused
<flutter_spin> heh. My mother always told me that I was slow in talking/reading, but good in creative processes like drawing/writing/sculpture
<LightNight> and cant see how anything that i have to choose is going to be fun
<junh1024-XD> lolwut

<MahBoi777> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, some songs
<HyperMetalLugia> I dunno :p
<junh1024-XD> i thought it was a bug in VLC that the center channel is too loud whenyou have a quad configuration?
<flutter_spin> I just felt like doing writing right now :P
<LightNight> i feel like i am spamming chat with my depressed thoughts and that the words i speak r doing no good to anybody
<junh1024-XD> i think it's the song fault
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<Alchemist> not everyone have a dream job. actually only the very lucky ones get paid to do what they like. The rest of us choose something we are okay with and use the money to fuel our acutal passion.
<flutter_spin> Actually, LightNight , I've been trying to piece your chat together.
<MahBoi777> LightNight: just think of the positives
<junh1024-XD> also, newer movies, the surround sound is more likely to be used/mixed better
<LightNight> wat is postivie?
<LightNight> besides the not negative end of a battery
<LightNight> stupid reference
<Dken2021> LightNight anything that's the opposite?
<LightNight> but in all honesty
<junh1024-XD> lolwut, the sor BD35 is transparent
<Dken2021> LightNight you're living and healthy, that's positive
<Shamroc> moop
<LightNight> i feel like i am trapped
<flutter_spin> It is an odd trade-off, like in my case. Spend your time working super hard living by yourself or spend your time in college while living in your parent's home. Now if they are forcing you and you HAVE to pay... that might be a different story
<flutter_spin> The odd situation, where I am now, is when college doesn't help you improve your job chances
<HyperMetalLugia> Weeirdd
<flutter_spin> In any chance, they look for your job experience and not college experience
<HyperMetalLugia> Is it a bootleg then? :P
<Alchemist> LightNight: I cant tell you what is positive. Its very subjective. What do YOU like?
<flutter_spin> But if you are looking for something to do in college, that might be more of a personal choice
<LightNight> it is rlly easy to answer
<Magic> well ttyl bye
<Dken2021> seeya Magic
<MahBoi777> later Magic!
<flutter_spin> woot its re... wait, I better not ping people ingame again
<LightNight> i like being happy
<LightNight> there is nothing fun
<junh1024-XD> nah, it also has redone? credits
<LightNight> besides friendship
<LightNight> i cant do anything
<APS|Meditating> LightNight: and cookies
<Alchemist> Then go and pursue that.
<LightNight> and have fun unless i have pl too work with
<superretroworld> i wonder if they'll be another pony in the mane 6
<junh1024-XD> looks sharp enough, but i think i see wierd artefacts around some outlines
<junh1024-XD> is it interlaced?
<flutter_spin> in the mane 6... you mean fighting is magic?
<HyperMetalLugia> That would be bad :s
<LightNight> but thats the problem i don't know how to pursue that
<junh1024-XD> hm,
<flutter_spin> or like in season 3, another pony be introduced
<junh1024-XD> Frame rate : 23.976 fps
<junh1024-XD> Color space : YUV
<junh1024-XD> Chroma subsampling : 4:2:0
<junh1024-XD> Bit depth : 8 bits
<junh1024-XD> Scan type : Progressive
<junh1024-XD> doesn't say so
<Alchemist> Simple: you go out and meet with lots of people.
<LightNight> i have a real problem with seeing the negative
<flutter_spin> exactly
<LightNight> in everything
<superretroworld> i mean in the show
<LightNight> it is too clear to me
<LightNight> the opposite is not so clear
<Alchemist> Maybe someone gives you reason to change your mind
<flutter_spin> I wouldn't mind an actual side story of like... Luna
<DocSane> Too easy to only see what's wrong with things
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: isnt there already a back story, in the very begining of the 1st ep
<flutter_spin> nono, like ep4.
<MahBoi777> gotta look at the positives, you'll feel much better
<flutter_spin> not a backstory, but a front... story? Like what Luna does on a normal typical day
<DocSane> There's always some good in everything.
<Om> MahBoi777: You are ugly but kind :)
<flutter_spin> What did she do during the wedding, for example
<Biglaw> ohai everypony!
<MahBoi777> Om: oh stop :D
<Dken2021> flutter_spin sleeping?
<LightNight> there is no postiive :(
<Dken2021> hai Biglaw
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: ya that'll be cool
<DocSane> Of course there is.
<superretroworld> LightNight: i think you need to see a therapist
<Ninjazz> LightNight: Never say that. There is always a positive. You just need to find it.
<Alchemist> LightNight: there IS positive. You just cant see it yet for some reason.
<flutter_spin> If you think about it, Luna is perhaps the only pony that is awake during the night. What does she do to preoccupy herself?
<OtakuTom> I'd love to see a "day in the life" episode comparing Luna to Celestia...heck, maybe even throw Cadence into it. I'd really like to see more about her.
<Alister> Who cares ?
<flutter_spin> Unlike the Gamer Luna series where she just plays games all night, I bet she has some awesome responsibilities
<DocSane> flutter_spin: I always imagine she flies around and protects Equestria from the terrors of the night
<Dken2021> LightNight I can tell you, I was like you once. but I realized I was too moody and a downer at times, and people don't like that
<flutter_spin> yeah. Totally be nice to have an episode like that DocSane
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: unlike someone coughcoughcelestiacoughcough
<Biglaw> Meet The Pyro was funny
<Ninjazz> Indeed. :D
<Dken2021> celestia is useless!
<LightNight> and because of ur personality not being excepted you changed urself to something that you are not
<MahBoi777> best one by far XD
<flutter_spin> I am SUPER curious of other lands too. Where was that image of things to look for. Let me find it....
<LightNight> i don't want to sound negative and rude
<LightNight> but like i said
<Biglaw> boooo?
<LightNight> i see negative and artificial
<Dken2021> LightNight well, even I didn't like myself like that
<DocSane> LightNight: Question - Are you a kid or an adult?
<LightNight> teen
<LightNight> i just graduated
<flutter_spin> great, my Internet is kicking out again
<LightNight> and don;t know wat to do with myself
<DocSane> LightNight: Then I daresay what you're feeling is normal.
<junh1024-XD> was the vocal levels on FRY_ME_TO_DA_MUUN too low?
<Ninjazz> ^
<MahBoi777> ^^
<Ninjazz> believe me... I was feeling JUST like you a few weeks ago.
<DocSane> LightNight: Graduated what? High school?
<LightNight> ya
<Biglaw> Goooooo Sumica!
<Dken2021> what is that talking? the pyro?
<flutter_spin> http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/05/24/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-season-predictions/ found it
<pony_759791> oh
<DocSane> LightNight: And you see the world full of liars and phoniness everywhere?
<superretroworld> LightNight: well theres nothng to worry about, youre starting a new life
<LCtest> This web client is interesting
<LightNight> not liars and phoniness just ppl how r misinformed and unwary of their situation
<flutter_spin> I've stopped pinging people playing after I found out that its... not good
<MahBoi777> well nobody's perfect

<SaxyPretender> 0,14don't worry Sumica, I got this
<Reikim> Hey Everypony!

<DocSane> LightNight: You're going to learn sooner or later that the only person you can really control is yourself.
<Dken2021> hai Reikim
<flutter_spin> Hey... wait, weren't you playing Rei...
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: why?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai Reikim
<Reikim> 'tis weird to hear the game in both here and in game
<OtakuTom> Hey Reikim
<Reikim> It's like an echo
<flutter_spin> pinging people I guess alt tabs them out of the game
<LightNight> that is not entirely true
<Reikim> How is everyone?
<LordCelestia> Hm
<Dken2021> oh, well lali-ho LordCelestia
<MahBoi777> hey Reikim!

<LordCelestia> lali-ho?
<MahBoi777> ohai LordCelestia

<mishia> oh hey ninjazz
<mishia> long time no see
<Ninjazz> ^_^

<MahBoi777> hey mishia!
<Biglaw> pyro is best pony
<APS|Assassin> Pinkie Pie is Best Pony
<MahBoi777> ^
<HyperMetalLugia> Yokan has fine volume
<Biglaw> Pinkie Pyro is best pony
<Dken2021> that's a weird spelling of spiderman
<DocSane> Twilight is the best, but Pinkie is a close second.
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: i actually never liked discord, body swap would be random, mane 6 flashback and cmc older would be awsome, new town eh, EVEN MORE LUNA, BUT NO SEA PONIES
<LightNight> i just feel that i am alone in my thoughts and I feel like others ignore or disregard wat i am saying thinking I'm trying to grab attention
<APS|Assassin> Rarity is too mainstream
<Ninjazz> Rarity. All I'm going to say before the war begins once again.
<Biglaw> Too Manestream
<LightNight> the more i say the more guilty i feel
<Ninjazz> APS|Assassin: LOL ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME?! :D
<junh1024-XD> nah, it's their fault & i thought that too.
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Dken2021> Rarity? mainstream? those word I have not heard together
<APS|Assassin> Ninjazz: NOPE
<LightNight> that i could be exposing others to something thye would come to realize as true
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<APS|Assassin> Ninjazz: caps
<HyperMetalLugia> but urgh
<Dken2021> *words
<HyperMetalLugia> Like
<DocSane> LightNight: And what is it that you say that they disregard?
<Ninjazz> She's one of the least liked and you actually say she's too mainstream?
<HyperMetalLugia> My new logitech Z4 speakers
<junh1024-XD> it's quite a simple fix when i get round to doing them
<Biglaw> Woo! Bronysith!
<HyperMetalLugia> are like super quiet
<HyperMetalLugia> compared to these old dell ones
<Ninjazz> UHHH. Ever heard of a little pony called Rainbow Dash?
<APS|Assassin> Ninjazz: every brony i ask they say rarity
<HyperMetalLugia> which have like 0 volume control
<CCCP> FALCON!
<LightNight> well when you see someone kill themselves for example u tend to look away or not want to think about it
<HyperMetalLugia> and are almost at max blast on the lowest setting
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<CCCP> PAWWQWWEFEW
<Biglaw> I like Rainbow Dash the best
<junh1024-XD> oh
<LightNight> but not many try to take it in as wat it is
<Ninjazz> You probably have been talking to smart bronies then.
<superretroworld> Ninjazz: actaully applejack was voted the least favourite pony from the 2012 awards
<MahBoi777> LightNight: think about your friends or someone that cares about you. there has to be someone
<Biglaw> Well, next to Vinyl
<Reikim> So yeah, been failing as pyro
<HyperMetalLugia> I have this like at
<Reikim> But the goggles are AMAZING
<Dken2021> everyone loves dash, cause she's fan favorite

<SaxyPretender> 0,14pyro goggles can be equipped on any class, Reikim
<Reikim> Dken2021: Actually I find she's quite polarizing
<HyperMetalLugia> and it is as loud as 40ish on my regular setting on my main speaks
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: I know, I just feel like playing pyro. I had a fun time as Demo earlier.
<LightNight> they have all chosen their own pathes and ways to go and i don't feel my presence has any relative meaning to it

<LightNight> i feel like i am just a bother and stain to society
<MahBoi777> LightNight: you are not a bother to anyone, don't tell yourself that
<DocSane> LightNight: The fact that you exist means that the world feels a need for you.
<LightNight> arent i though?

<Alchemist> try to value yourself more and dont put the happiness of people (who would ridicule you for some reason) in front of yours.
<ingwaz> LightNight: i dont really see how thats an intrusion? as someone whos a bit on the analytical side, i understand where you're coming from, and while i think that way too sometimes, contrary to what i think seems logical, depending on the situation, its really not an intrusion

<DocSane> LightNight: Everyone here has a different story. I don't think anyone thinks they have a line on pure happiness.
<LightNight> Apple Jack and Fluttershy
<Ninjazz> I'm glad you did.
<superretroworld> anybody find pinkies voice different in the welcome song?
<Biglaw> DocSane very true
<MahBoi777> superretroworld: not really
<Dken2021> nosebleeds, they confuse me
<ingwaz> superretroworld: nope, sounds like andrea libman to me
<Dken2021> it's a japanese custon
<ingwaz> Dken2021: custom is not really accurate
<superretroworld> weird
<Ninjazz> lol
<Biglaw> My most confusing nosebleed was whenever I moved, and the second I got out of the truck, my nose bled
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Andrea Libman doesn't do the singing voice for Pinkie
<Glacymr> sit
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that would be Shannon Chan-Kent
<Glacymr> hi
<Alchemist> I thought she was Rarity's singing voice
<superretroworld> oh
<ingwaz> SaxyPretender: the problem is, did she sing that, or did andrea libman in order to keep it more like pinkie because it was such a small short song
<ingwaz> SaxyPretender: long story short, it sounded like pinkie to me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I believe both are credited with singing the Smile song
<flutter_spin> I can't. I can't play Lollipop Chainsaw without thinking of Twilight Sparkle
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, Rarity's singing voice is provided by Kazumi Evans
<DocSane> Dken2021: Nose bleeds are kind of obvious: increased blood pressure = nose bleed.
<Biglaw> KILL EVERYTHING WITH FIRE
<LightNight> maybe Pinkie is my favourite
<MahBoi777> YES
<MahBoi777> XD
<ingwaz> LightNight: honesty and kindness, things you feel you have trouble showing?
<LightNight> she seems like the opposite of anything i have seen before
<LightNight> i can be kind
<MahBoi777> I <3 Pinkie
<LightNight> i like to see others happy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...also, sidenote: Kazumi Evans is pretty >.>
<ingwaz> i didnt mean you were unkind
<Biglaw> The one bad thing about pyro is the short range of his/her weapons
<superretroworld> then how can gabe have pictures of ponies in tf2?
<Ninjazz> SaxyPretender: Just like Rarity. :3
<pony_793610> l
<ingwaz> rather that you have trouble showing it in social situations, you find it awkward
<DocSane> LightNight: You should note that Pinkie NEEDS to make others happy because she's terrified of ever feeling sad.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14indeed, Ninjazz
<LightNight> maybe i can realte to that
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Dken2021> superretroworld those are tags users put there
<superretroworld> Dken2021: oh
<ingwaz> DocSane: not true, shes not terrified of not feeling happy, she just loves being happy and making others happy
<flutter_spin> ^^ LightNight , you should read my fanfics :P
<DocSane> ingwaz: I disagree, based on what we saw in Cutie Mark Chronicles.
<Dken2021> didn't know you wrote fics flutter_spin
<LightNight> link plz
<flutter_spin> you'd be surprised. I've been still reworking the first fanfic.
<pony_793610> so does anyone do art???
<flutter_spin> Otherwise, I would have advertised it
<Biglaw> ouxh
<DocSane> ingwaz: She spent her early life feeling sad and lonely, saw something beautiful that made her happy for the first time, and has spent the rest of her life trying to never let that feeling fade.
<flutter_spin> http://wreky.deviantart.com/ Wrek does art
<ingwaz> DocSane: at what point in cutie mark chronicles was she scared? she was worried that her family would reject her new found happiness, this is true, but not scared because she wouldnt be happy, she was already happy, she just wanted to share that happiness
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/user/flutterspin
<Alchemist> wow. the brony vs antibrony flame war is still raging in the pyro video throough 50000 comments :D
<Ninjazz> =__(\
<flutter_spin> really Alchemist ?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mfw
<Dken2021> Alchemist I would imagine it's total chaos
<LightNight> maybe i am pinkie in past tense
<Stallion_of_War> The pyro has G3 vision...
<Alchemist> its scary :D
<DocSane> ingwaz: No, the scared part is from the episode where she had her nervous breakdown.
<Biglaw> that's not chocolate milk :p
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: whos tavi?
<Biglaw> DocSane Party of one?
<LightNight> i can see rlly relate to her feeling trapped and surronded by depression
<DocSane> Yes
<Alchemist> at this point I think trolls are trolling trolls :D
<LightNight> but remember wat cured her
<Stallion_of_War> superretroworld: Tavi is short for Octavia
<flutter_spin> Tavi?
<LightNight> an anomaly
<LightNight> something unrealistic
<ingwaz> DocSane: she had a nervous breakdown because she is pinkie pie and let her worries get the better of her that her friends didnt like her anymore, not that she was not happy
<HyperMetalLugia> !rorara
<LightNight> unexplanable
<superretroworld> oh
<flutter_spin> Never use 'tavi' .. Octavia gives her respect
<Dken2021> curse you kickbot
<Biglaw> Buildin' Buildin' Buildin'
<LightNight> i got kicked might have missed something
<ingwaz> LightNight: you posted too much in a short amount of time
<ingwaz> 6 times in 10 seconds i think?
<LightNight> too much to say
<ingwaz> LightNight: it was an automated kick, it happens to all of us sometimes
<superretroworld> ingwaz: im confused, was that becasue they didnt like her parties or was it actually her birthday?
<Alchemist> often quiet people have the loudest minds :)
<DocSane> ingwaz: But you see, the fact that the mere idea that her friends didn't really like her triggering her breakdown shows that she's terrified of other people not liking her.
<LightNight> society limits the creativity and abstract feelings
<flutter_spin> lol
<ingwaz> superretroworld: huh? is that a joke?
<Biglaw> HeroBrony!
*flutter_spin whispers I love you!
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: flare would be jealous :D
<Dken2021> was it her birthday when she got her cutiemark?
<flutter_spin> flare?
<superretroworld> ingwaz: im guessing it was her birthday
<CCCP> nighty night
<Biglaw> FlareChaser
<DocSane> ingwaz: And that was elaborated on with her deperately trying to get Cranky to like her.
<Dken2021> nighty FlareChaser
<flutter_spin> lol
<Biglaw> nighty night CCCP! *glomps*
<flutter_spin> jealous of what?
<MahBoi777> gnight FlareChaser! take care:)
<Dken2021> no wait...
<FlareChaser> what?!
<FlareChaser> NO!
<FlareChaser> I
<LightNight> maybe the only way for me to be happy is to be like pinkie and just go out of my way to be myself and outgoing
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: being with vinyl scrath in the link you posted
*CCCP walts over to Biglaw and hugs
<ingwaz> DocSane: it was not the mere idea that caused an immediate breakdown, it was a serious of very suspicious looking events that made it look like all her friends had been lying to her, secretly hated her, and wanted nothing to do with her anymore
<FlareChaser> ...
<DocSane> ingwaz: I mean, she sang a song with the line "THere's one thing that makes me happy and makes my whole life worth while/And that's when I talk to my friends and get them to smile"
*Biglaw wubs hugs
*FlareChaser stabs CCCP
<FlareChaser> no.
<Biglaw> :O
<ingwaz> DocSane: that would be enough to depress anyone, and when your mind moves as fast as pinkie, thats a dangerous thing
<Dken2021> and now they're quoting tfs
<CCCP> FlareChaser: C:
<LightNight> but she looks happy
<CCCP> <3 goodnighty nighty
<DocSane> ingwaz: From everything we've seen of Pinkie on the show, she's an extremely insecure girl.
<LightNight> she looks unembarassed
<flutter_spin> I'm confused. The link I posted was to my fanfic user page. Nowhere do I mention Vinyl or Octavia
<Dken2021> nighty night CCCP
<Biglaw> Those are beer goggles
<LightNight> truley honest
*CCCP hugs Dken2021
<LightNight> see ya
*Dken2021 hugs CCCP back :D
<LightNight> dken
<Dken2021> I ain't going LightNight
<flutter_spin> Unless you are stating that Moonlight IS me... which is more or less true
<CCCP> ergerger
<LightNight> oh
<LightNight> ccp
<LightNight> oops
<LightNight> i am confused
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: didnt you post a link of wreks art?
<DocSane> ingwaz: She's happy as long as her role of clown and partymaker are intact.
*Ninjazz pats LightNight on the back "it's no worry"
<MahBoi777> LightNight: no problem
<flutter_spin> yes, but I fail to see where I am in the picture
<DocSane> ingwaz: She gets dangerously depressed if those roles are ever questioned.
<Dken2021> I fill her up, Balloons!
<Biglaw> Baaaloooooons
<ingwaz> DocSane: i would not say extremely insecure, if she were extremely insecure, she would have suspected the other ponies excuses for why they couldnt come to her party outright and called them liars even if they had legitimate excuses. it is not that she is insecure, its that she had something she thought absolutely impossible shoved in her face due to unfortunate misperceived circumstances which caused her some serious depression
<ingwaz> DocSane: when kranky rejected her many times, she did not get depressed, she was simply determined
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: there was a picture of vinyl scracth and octavia remember?
<flutter_spin> Wrek is not me. Wrek is Wrek. He draws on the stream all the time.
<Biglaw> wow
<DocSane> ingwaz: But her determination shows that it's not that she wants to be friends with everyone. She NEEDS to be friends with everyone.
<Biglaw> .
<ingwaz> DocSane: not true, she was willing to accept that cranky would not be her friend
<DocSane> ingwaz: Because if one person rejects her, it means that everyone else potentially can, as well./

<flutter_spin> woot DeathStar
<ingwaz> DocSane: forgive her for accidentally ruining an object of his, not become his friend
<MahBoi777> good afternoon DeathStar!:)
<Sylandest> howdy, SaxyPretender! How are you?

<junh1024-XD> （￣へ￣）
<junh1024-XD> Y DU DIS!!
<LightNight> and wasted many ppls time
<DocSane> ingwaz: She was still trying to extract some kind of victory by trying to get him to say that he didn't hate her.
<Dken2021> LightNight I didn't think it was
<Glacymr> because you !glacymred
<Biglaw> Om and not a single buck was given that day
<ingwaz> LightNight: i cant tell you the answers because theyre your answers, not mine. but dont be so worried about it so much. not everyone needs to be mr. popular with 100 friends. you are who you ar
<Om> Biglaw: Not a one.
<Biglaw> Chocodiles
<ingwaz> DocSane: again, not true, she asked for forgiveness for destroying an item, cranky never once said he hated her, simply that he did not wish to be her friend
<LightNight> nobody has true friends
<LightNight> nobody is true
<DocSane> ingwaz: One thing that's very telling in that episode is during the song, when we see sad Pinkie being comforted by happy Pinkie.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I doubt that, LightNight
<RainBowJack> well goodbye everypony i have to go to work now cyas

<Ninjazz> Cya, RainBowJack. Take care.
<Biglaw> LightNight Nothing is true, everything is permitted
<Ninjazz> Some of my best friends are here, actually.
<ingwaz> Biglaw: sacred, not true
<DocSane> ingwaz: Because they switch from showing Pinkie comforting all her friends to comforting herself.
<DocSane> ingwaz: And there's the crux of why Pinkie acts the way she does.
<Biglaw> You're... Going to LOVE ME!:[
<Dken2021> da wha?
<LightNight> but how true r u to them?
<LightNight> maybe its just me
<LightNight> but i don't act true
<LightNight> i cant
<DocSane> ingwaz: All that running around and making people happy is her constantly keeping herself from falling into gloom.
<Dken2021> but cancer taste delicious with butter
<ingwaz> DocSane: we all get depressed and sad at some points, it was not necesarily about being two sides of a coin, its about the being one in the same.
<superretroworld> DocSane: no not pinkie
<ingwaz> DocSane: thats caused by all those sweets
<Biglaw> Hee hee
<DocSane> ingwaz: It's all there in that musical number.
<Dark92Enigma> OK, gotta go to sleep ...........see you tomorrow
<ingwaz> LightNight: haha, i bet you analyze situations when talking to people and try to pick the best possible choice of words or what to do in order to keep them happy, dont you?
<ingwaz> DocSane: i disagree entirely
<DocSane> ingwaz: As I said, they literally show her pulling her sad self out of the gloom and making her happy.

<ingwaz> DocSane: if that were the case, she would literally need to be making others happy 24/7, which she does not

<DocSane> ingwaz: She isn't?
<junh1024-XD> >lip flap
<MahBoi777> bye Dark92Enigma
<ingwaz> LightNight: so do i, its difficult though
<DocSane> ingwaz: Because that episode implies that she spends her days doing exactly that.
<Dken2021> so pinkie feeds on the happiness on others, a crazy pony, or a changeling in disquise?
<Ninjazz> Cya, Dark92Enigma. Take care.
<ingwaz> DocSane: that is her element, a predominant part of her personality. not the entirety of her personality
<Biglaw> Mmm mmmmph
<DocSane> She doesn't so much feed on it as use it as a central support to her personality.
<ingwaz> LightNight: people are quite hard to understand arent they? you analyze the situation, pick the logical choice, and yet soemtimes they do something so strange
<superretroworld> night everypony
<Dken2021> goodninght superretroworld
<sagas> well im off to bed
<DocSane> They need to do an episode similar to Winter Wrap-Up, where they take away the defining thing to Pinie and then see how she deals with it.
<Biglaw> night superretroworld!
<Dken2021> goodninght sagas
<Biglaw> Sugar Famine of Ponyville
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later sagas
<DocSane> Winter Wrap-Up was all about Twilight discovering what's left when you take away her magic.

<LightNight> i just try to do wat ppl will except me by
<LightNight> i try to stay within the boundaries of society
<LightNight> i try to not do anything unordinary
<Biglaw> ALL the boredom!
<LightNight> but i think this just shows how dumb i am
<ingwaz> DocSane: twilights magic doesnt really compare with pinkie pie at all unless you take away her ability to party at all, which in that case...she would probably be able to sit still for a very short time, and then freak out from boredom
<Dken2021> Biglaw, come and be bored with us!
<Reikim> So are you guys enjoying the stream?
<Biglaw> Dken2021 don't have steam, and my netbook wouldn't be able to run TF2 efficiently
<ingwaz> LightNight: stupidity is claimed by those who cannot admit their ignorance. a lack of understanding does not make one stupid
<DocSane> ingwaz: I mean do an episode where Pinkie can't rely on making others happy in order to make herself happy.
<BAppleJuice> Just joined the stream

*Biglaw pats SaxyPretender's shoulfer
<LightNight> well im just confused
<DocSane> ingwaz: In other words, what happens when you cut off the most social character on the show from her social network?
<Biglaw> Shoulder*
<Dinner> Nittany_Discord: Good job being a team player.
<ingwaz> DocSane: that requires that you base her personality on the idea that she must continually make others happy in order to keep herself happy.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14mfw only 4 passes left for BronyCon
<Biglaw> Pyros everywhere
<Alchemist> I have read most of the stuff, but if they want me to talk about specifics Im screwed :D
<DocSane> ingwaz: I maintain that the text of the Pinkie episodes bears that out.
<ingwaz> DocSane: complete removal very suddenly from any and all social contact would disturb anyone who had somewhat of a social circle
<Biglaw> SaxyPretender I would go, but I have no money, and no way to get there
<ingwaz> DocSane: and i reject that idea

<HyperMetalLugia> Your OS is frozen!
<SolairePony89> A picture of a kitten next to a pic of Fluttershy's plot. Nosureifgusta
<Biglaw> Everything is Pyro-Fied
<Biglaw> So
<SolairePony89> SaxyPretender: Awww. Someone here needs to stream Bronycon
<ingwaz> DocSane: you're not citing a specific segment, you're using a specific segment by suggesting that it implies that condition. i have said many times before that if you look at it from another way, it suggests that it is not the case
<Biglaw> Perhaps next year I'll try to go to BronyCon
<BAppleJuice> they will be having a bronycon stream at everfree radio
<DocSane> No, I'm not implying. I cited direct quotes and specific segments.
<Alchemist> I wont ever go to Bronycon. Its 10000km away.
<Biglaw> Mmmhmmhmmhmmmhmmmm!
<Biglaw> For me, BronyCon is about 850km
<Bronysith> i would go to bronycon
<BAppleJuice> what are you two arguing about anyway?
<Bronysith> but i cant
<Bronysith> Shamroc: Meanwhile is rigth behind you
<BAppleJuice> ingwaz and
<DocSane> Cutie Mark Chronicles specifically stated that she uses parties to keep the feeling she had of seeing the rainboom from fading.
<BAppleJuice> why are we arguing about something like this?
<BAppleJuice> seems pointless
<ingwaz> DocSane: not once has it been stated by pinkie pie or others that she must keep others happy in order to keep herself happy so that she does not fall in to a very deep depression and a bit of a psychotic fit
<DocSane> BAppleJuice: I claim that Pinkie Pie is extremely insecure and has a need to make others happy in order to keep herself happy.
<Bronysith> BAppleJuice: there is no point, THERES NEVER A POINT
<Alchemist> look at them being philosophical, citing quotes and shizz :D
<Glacymr> o-o
<Glacymr> what do you think i'm doing?
<Alchemist> its impressive :)
<BAppleJuice> I mean, that goes under "inconsequential" for me. I mean I think about the characters, but why argue
<DocSane> Don't go to film school, kids. This is where it lands you.
<DaemonLucius> i still loves pinkie pie
<Glacymr> using apple?
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<HyperMetalLugia> Using any OS
<HyperMetalLugia> The bad GPU driver plague has spread
<ingwaz> DocSane: in the cutie mark chronicles, pinkie sees the rainboom, says she never felt joy like that before and that she wanted to share it. knowing that rainbooms do not come along often, she decides to throw a party in an attempt to get her family to smile. no where in there does she has to do so to keep the feeling
<HyperMetalLugia> No OS is safe :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Sumica, that was a burn :3
<ingwaz> does she say she has*
<BAppleJuice> also the debate seems to be missing the point entirely
<Dken2021> d'aww http://www.deviantart.com/#/d556f58
<BAppleJuice> of COURSE she wants to continue feeling good
<BAppleJuice> and finding a passion is a good way for anyone to keep happy and joyful

<junh1024-XD> however, I don't have a gfx card \o/
<Glacymr> o-o
<ingwaz> DocSane: had it been the case that she had to, when her family did not originally act favorably, she would have had a much harsher emotional reaction than simply being disappointed

<Bronysith> Irish_Pony: tf2 the greatest pc shooter ever
<OneTrickPony> hiya Irish_Pony
<Glacymr> i guess you have worse things to deal with
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: the disagreement that we are having is that pinkie feels she must keep others happy in order to keep herself happy so that she does not fall in to a deep depression and somewhat psychotic rage
<SolairePony89> BAppleJuice: So I wasn't the only one that had that thought?
<junh1024-XD> i'm using the i3 intergrated gfx drivers
<nickstr> then how are you displaying text and graphics on a monitor?
<SolairePony89> Hiiyo Irish_Pony, have you seen Meet the Pyro yet?
<Biglaw> Pete-Sauce
<Irish_Pony> SolairePony89: Indeed :P
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: basically, if shes not making others happy, shes not happy, and if shes not happy, shes depressed to the extreme
<Alchemist> so basically Pinkie is a ticking psycho time-bomb?
<ingwaz> Alchemist: unless i'm mistaken, thats the stance DocSane is taking
<BAppleJuice> ingwaz: that is not important to the show since it would never go that far. That's what fan fiction is for, to explore character traits
<SolairePony89> Irish_Pony: Just checkin'. Whoever's streaming is seeing in Pyrovision
<xmasskills> did they really make the rainbow shooting gun
<OneTrickPony> lol
<BAppleJuice> I mean there's nothing objective about this argument
<Alchemist> well, so is Twilight :D
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: in fan fiction thats fine, but if someone is imposing it on the actual show, that i disagree with
<DocSane> (Rewatches the scene in Cutie Mark Chronicles...)
<HyperMetalLugia> The GPU is in the CPU package ;O
<HyperMetalLugia> GNEIUS
<Ninjazz> Indeed, ingwaz.
<BAppleJuice> well, ingwaz, sometimes you have to get over it. people will differ in opinions
<junh1024-XD> well, some mnfs like to call it a "APU"
<Irish_Pony> well if you'll all excuse me, theres some vintage googles that I must obtain :P
<Alchemist> now kiss
<xxMoopyxx> Hey eveypony whats up yall
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: that i can accept, and the entire debate will have to end regardless as i've got to get to sleep. but debating is just something i do. i can agree to disagree just fine, but if someone tells me i'm wrong about something and i believe i'm not, i will defend my view
<Dken2021> nothing like eating cereal at 12 at night
<Dken2021> hai xxMoopyxx
<xxMoopyxx> hai
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: of course, if they can show me that i'm wrong, then i can accept that i'm wrong as well
<OneTrickPony> hiya xxMoopyxx
<xxMoopyxx> hiya
<junh1024-XD> sometimes my gfx does crash, but it usually brings itself up again after a few secs
<nickstr> issue is that it inhibits upgrades
<nickstr> but then again, you are on a Mac so you are used to having no upgrade options
<HyperMetalLugia> dats 4 UDMA scoolz
<BAppleJuice> well I suppose if you enjoy debating on that level, then there is no saving you. anyway, it's not a crime to argue about ponies - but it does seem inane
<BAppleJuice> just my input
<junh1024-XD> actually, i'm on a PC
<HyperMetalLugia> True story
<OneTrickPony> yay!
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47 you here man
<HyperMetalLugia> He's on a PC
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<HyperMetalLugia> ;O
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh wait I forgot
<DocSane> Pinkie's lines after seeing the rainboom: "I'd never felt joy like that before! It felt so good that I just wanted to keep smiling forever! And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too! But rainbows don;t come along that often. I wondered how I else I could create some smiles."
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, I'm off to bed
<junh1024-XD> i been having a PC as a primay computer for 1.5+ years
<SaxyPretender> 0,14good night, everyone and enjoy the stream
<junh1024-XD> i cound install a dedicated gfx card
<HyperMetalLugia> Making music is soo much more sensible than on a Mac :<
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: night man
<Biglaw> Eeeeeeh!
<HyperMetalLugia> I haz one
<junh1024-XD> well, depenz
<Dken2021> goodninght SaxyPretender
<BAppleJuice> nighty night saxy
<BAppleJuice> you saxy beast
<OtakuTom> Good night Saxy
<HyperMetalLugia> But I bet your integrated GPU is betah
<Biglaw> Good night SaxyPretender! Stay... Saxy?
<junh1024-XD> it's eh, but if i don't game, i'm fine
<xxMoopyxx> is that the new pyro taunt thing?
<junh1024-XD> main reason you'd want a mac for music is logic/garageband and possibly a solid audio/MIDI framework
<ingwaz> DocSane: but her reaction to her family's initial perceived rejection is not an extreme. if her emotions were that fragile and insecure, they would have been
<Bronysith> well
<HyperMetalLugia> Ahem
<HyperMetalLugia> Get a nice powerful PC
<HyperMetalLugia> Run Virtualbox + OSX
<HyperMetalLugia> and profit
<HyperMetalLugia> ;l
<HyperMetalLugia> I can run it right now :s
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always, MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL AND PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH YOUR SPIRIT
<ingwaz> DocSane: also, if anything, the events leading up to party of one, since we do not know of any time where shes had trouble being happy would seem to make her less insecure rather than more
<Biglaw> GOOD NIGHT Bronysith!
<xxMoopyxx> thanks
<junh1024-XD> it's not quite the same. OSX is quite laggy/buggy on PC VM, iirc
*Tovler writes a fanfic where Pinkie Pie cheers up foals at an orphanage set during the great parasprite famine.
<MahBoi777> gnight Bronysith!
<Dken2021> may the 4th be wit hyou as well Bronysith
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<BAppleJuice> ingwaz, did you see PARTY.MOV?
<Alchemist> there is just too much shit in this subject! I cant memorize them all!
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: inane it can be, but this is how i kind of feel when it goes with a debate http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/duty_calls.png
<HyperMetalLugia> It's almost stable for me
<junh1024-XD> besides, thereare plenty of fine PC or cross-platform music programs
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: yes, some of it was funny, but overall kind of meh
<HyperMetalLugia> The funny thing is
<junh1024-XD> but if you want to do surround sound, PC might be easier 'cuz many modern PCS have analogue surround out.
<BAppleJuice> ingwaz: funny link :)
<HyperMetalLugia> the audio kext is b0rked
<junh1024-XD> esp. if you build your own
<HyperMetalLugia> Crashes dat VM
<HyperMetalLugia> badly
<DocSane> ingwaz: I think the events leading up to her breakdown in Party of One show that she has a pretty strong ability to deny the obvious when she doesn;t want to face an unpleasant truth.
<junh1024-XD> for mac or laptops you might need to external sound card
<BAppleJuice> ingwaz: didja find the secret message? allso I kinda agree. It is seeming more and more like family guy or something
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: wasnt really looking for a secret message, so perhaps i missed it
<xxMoopyxx> Yay its sumica
<DocSane> ingwaz: Notice that she basically forces Spike to tell her the thing she didn't want to hear because she wouldn't admit it to herself.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well hey
<HyperMetalLugia> You can have over 9000 (tm) audio ports on a PC
<ingwaz> DocSane: if she were as insecure and as unstable as you suggest, the slightest thing would offset her extremely and send her in to a downward spiral
<HyperMetalLugia> PCi/PCI-E sound cards ftw
<BAppleJuice> ingwaz: it was on Pinkie Pie's booze. It was apple code: ***** ***** ****** ****
<junh1024-XD> limited by the amount of expansion ports you have
<HyperMetalLugia> Sadly
<HyperMetalLugia> But one day.
<BAppleJuice> want me to reveal the message? :)
<Biglaw> I need to go to bed everypony, see you all later!
<ingwaz> BAppleJuice: sure...i'm not going to bother to check it
<BAppleJuice> ok
<BAppleJuice> APPLE BLOOM NEVER DIED
<DocSane> ingwaz: Not necessarily true. Insecure people build up some pretty extreme defenses to hide their insecurity.
<Dken2021> seeya Biglaw
<Biglaw> Good night Everypony!
<OneTrickPony> night Biglaw
<BAppleJuice> night BIGLAW
<MahBoi777> gnight Biglaw
<Biglaw> OneTrickPony's got one song
<BAppleJuice> later bigjaw!
<BAppleJuice> LAW
<Biglaw> Bigjaw????
<Biglaw> Da Buck?
<OneTrickPony> :)
<DocSane> ingwaz: My personal head canon at this point is that Pinkie laughs at the things that scare her, and she laughs all the time because, deep down, she's ALWAYS scared.
<BAppleJuice> opps i mispeld it
<junh1024-XD> ...?
<ingwaz> DocSane: if her defenses were that extreme, she would not have minded their excuses at all, yet she quickly turned to suspicion after RD and FS talked to her
<HyperMetalLugia> Nothing ;-;
<ingwaz> DocSane: head canon i can accept, actual canon i will debate about until the cows come home
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<xxMoopyxx> Hey whats veemi.com?
<HyperMetalLugia> It's just
<XAX> DocSane: dat theory
<HyperMetalLugia> we need more PCI ports
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<DocSane> ingwaz: But her suspicion only arose after EVERYONE begged off on her party.

<Dken2021> xxMoopyxx the site which this stream is being broadcasted on
<xxMoopyxx> oh ok
<junh1024-XD> auido from SOR, sometimes ambience, sometimes discrete material in the back speakers
<ingwaz> DocSane: but she accepted rd and fs' excuse as legitimate and then suspected ts, aj and ra, who had more believable excuses
<DocSane> ingwaz: She managed to keep fooling herself right up to the point that RD and FS became the last two friends who rejected her.
<ingwaz> DocSane: that seems backwards
<HyperMetalLugia> 2GB
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<junh1024-XD> ntrly
<HyperMetalLugia> 3GB
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<HyperMetalLugia> Big file
<DocSane> ingwaz: Well, see, that's the Rule of Funny kicking in.
<junh1024-XD> 6 channels, 24bit FLAC (from DTSHD)
<HyperMetalLugia> Can that be mixed down to 4chan easier/
<junh1024-XD> 1h49mins
<ingwaz> DocSane: if you're talking about something logically, you cant throw in the rule of funny to disregard something
<HyperMetalLugia> lolol4chan
<junh1024-XD> just shove it though VLC in 2F2R mode
<DocSane> ingwaz: That's the joke. She believes the obvious lie and suspects the more reasonable excuses.
<xxMoopyxx> they talk funny
<DocSane> ingwaz: But that's how her character works.
<HyperMetalLugia> Amazing that programs do the work for you
<junh1024-XD> or if you want to make a separate file that IS 4ch, should be easy enough
<ingwaz> DocSane: i understand its a joke, but if you're not taking her literally at all times, you cannot take what she says literally other times and be 100% certain about it
<DocSane> ingwaz: She can be almost perfectly illogical at times.
<junh1024-XD> (without downmixing on playback)
<xmasskills> hehe
<Flutterfly> listening to flutter F
<ingwaz> DocSane: her extreme depression in party of one can easily be disregarded by the rule of funny in that case
<DocSane> ingwaz: Except the whole episode built up to it. It wasn't a throwaway gag.
<DocSane> ingwaz: That whole episode turns on the breakdown and her reaction to the idea that her friends don;t like her anymore.
<HyperMetalLugia> It's raining
<HyperMetalLugia> heavily
<HyperMetalLugia> 2am rain
<HyperMetalLugia> I like rain
<DocSane> ingwaz: And it's consistent, from the set-up to the denouement in the barn at her birthday party.
<Alchemist> damn. microsleeps are kicking in
<Alchemist> need coffee
<junh1024-XD> doesn't rain maek sleeping harder?
<xxMoopyxx> Heh its like a baby land
<Alchemist> brb
<HyperMetalLugia> I leik teh rain
<ingwaz> DocSane: again, if the best friends you had suddenly ditched you, hated you, and wanted you gone, that would be enough to depress anyone. pinkie moves at a mile a minute, coupling that with depression is a recipe for disaster
<DocSane> (I need to turn this into a panel for this year's Anime Weekend Atlanta)
<nickstr1> I am glad its not raining
<junh1024-XD> inb4 reception would be wuss
<Reikim> Wow. Are we still arguing here?
<DocSane> ingwaz: But no one ever said that they hated her. That was her telling herself that.
<nickstr> yea
<ingwaz> yet when she believed her parents had rejected her party in the cutie mark chronicles, she did not have an extreme reaction. i see the points you're making, but there are other points that disagree with it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Team Failtress :<
<Reikim> ingwaz: a) that was a story told from Pinkie's point of view, b) she didn't have the chance to.
<nickstr> cellular phones use the UHF high band or even EHF low band
<nickstr> those bands do not penetrate walls very well
<nickstr> and its especially bad on rainy days
<ingwaz> DocSane: the events told her that they did, they indeed did not say outright to her face, we hate you, she saw them on several occasions saying that they didnt want her to find out, their thing would be much better than her party, i know fluttershy said something as well but it escapes me atm
<xxMoopyxx> oh wow the offline thing again
<SolairePony89> This is still going on?!
<ingwaz> Reikim: she became depressed in an instant in party of one, at first she was sad, but she quickly changed
<SolairePony89> Long debate is loooooooong
<ingwaz> fear not SolairePony89, i need to sleep, have to be back up in 6 hours for work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's it for me.
<xxMoopyxx> well i guess i have to back out and re come back in i guess
<RyunosukeKnT> just when I want to go to bed... PONY STORIES ...
<OneTrickPony> I recorded some of the derp rockets from yesterday http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yng0E3pCPGM&feature=g-upl :3
<Ninjazz> Thanks for the stream, Nittany_Discord. :)
<Sumica> 00,10embed is on mips refresh if you want to see what's on it
<MahBoi777> thanks for streaming Nittany_Discord!
<DocSane> ingwaz: The parts where they don't perfectly agree can be explained by the three main Pinkie episode having been written by three different writers.
<nickstr> the typical bands for CDMA and GSM phones are 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz
<ingwaz> DocSane: if its not laid out as fact, then its not necessarily the case
<Alchemist> mmmmmmm
<OneTrickPony> D'aaaawwwwwwww
<Alchemist> coffeeee
<Sumica> 00,10So I said I would re air it tonight and here it is
<DocSane> ingwaz: But all three have common elements of Pinkie feeling a need to spread laughter, being upset when it's rejected, and being driven to extremes of behavior to correct it.
<Ninjazz> Woo~ Thanks, Sumi!
<MahBoi777> YAY
<CrimsonPhoenix> OHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSH
<OneTrickPony> yea!!!!
<LightNight> pinkie pie wat is the way out
<OneTrickPony> F*** YEA!
<ingwaz> DocSane: whats teh 3rd one you're thinking of? obviously cutie mark chronicles and a friend in deed
<Sumica> 00,10Time for some Iroh man
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> korra!
<OtakuTom> Gah! I've missed the last 3 episodes before this, I feel like I shouldn't be watching this x_x
<OneTrickPony> lol nope
<Ninjazz> Me too, OtakuTom. T__T
<DocSane> Cutie Mark Chronicles, Party of One, and Friend In Deed are the three major Pinkie epsiodes.
<Ninjazz> BUT SCREW IT! I MUST SEE IT ON STREAM!
<DocSane> Baby Cakes mainly focuses on Pinkie being pissed off that no one ever takes her seriosuly.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, Baby Cakes?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh
<APS|AC-130_Gunner> why do i see korra?
<ingwaz> DocSane: ahh of course, i wasnt thinking correctly for some reason, brain was saying cutie mark chronicles and party of one were the same
<Dken2021> wow, this debate's still going?
<Meanwhile> Say going to bed, decide to check stream out. It's Legend of Korra. Fml, staying awake.
<DocSane> And THAT theme is repeated in Feeling Pinkie Keen and Swarm of the Century.
<OneTrickPony> Dken2021: what is this debate about?
<Dken2021> goodnight Meanwhile
<Ninjazz> Hey, atleast it's intellegent conversation and not just stupid "best pony debates"
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: What part of "staying awake" slipped by you? :P
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Meanwhile. Take care, man.
<ingwaz> DocSane: DocSane her reactions are extremely different in those 3 eps. and when are those reactions shown in those two eps?
<Ninjazz> Oh wait.
<Sumica> 00,10lol
*Meanwhile bonks Ninjazz with a plank.
<Dken2021> Meanwhile the part with me being tired
*Ninjazz scratches his head :P
<Ninjazz> Sorry.
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: It's 6:30 AM from my perspective, suck it up.
<DocSane> ingwaz: Well, she wasn't upset in Pinkie Keen, just kind of bemused that Twi didn't believe in her Pinkie Sense.
<ingwaz> DocSane: dont really see how that relates to this
<LightNight> ha i rlly should get therapy
<DocSane> ingwaz: It doesn't. I was just pointing out the themes of the OTHER major Pinkie Pie episodes.
<LightNight> i dont think they could tell me anything intelligent or real answers
<ingwaz> DocSane: thats a pretty big jump from confusion that a friend doesnt believe you about something to not being happy means you're a depressed psychopath
<Ninjazz> All I hear is Zuko.
<Meanwhile> Yup.
<OtakuTom> Yea, that's what I'm hearing, Ninjazz
<DocSane> ingwaz: I never said she's a depressed psychopath. I said she's extremely insecure and has a neurotic need to make others happy.
<Meanwhile> Und dann planes.
<FlareChaser|> ugh.
<Sumica> 00,10He's the love child of Zuko and Iroh
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: Yup
<Meanwhile> Sumica: ...dude.
<Ninjazz> Oh mai~
<Ninjazz> :D
<ingwaz> DocSane: were you not saying that if she was not happy she would basically go back to how she was when she freaked out in party of one?
<Ninjazz> It's freakin' Pearl Harbor all over again! D:
<Dken2021> that sounded so wrong sumi
<Sumica> 00,10forgot this file has a bad section
<CrimsonPhoenix> ingwaz, DocSane would you two mind moving this in a pm?
<DocSane> ingwaz: No, I said that she operates under a general fear of not being happy.
<DocSane> Actually, it's 1:30 AM and I should really go to sleep.
<Ninjazz> This is so WW2.
<ingwaz> DocSane: well, i still disagree with that but its not as extreme. we've been asked to stop as well, and i need to sleep
<Dken2021> eh, I guess bed for me then, have fun with your korra and pinkie debate
<Meanwhile> Night Dken2021
<recieve> ..
<ingwaz> DocSane: so, you keep your head canon to your head, and i'll keep mine
<Sumica> 00,10more clse to ww1 in most sence
<Ninjazz> With... that extra Water Sprite in the middle.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: ^
<Dken2021> goodninght DocSane
<ingwaz> DocSane: and lets never do this again
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Dken2021. Take care. :)
<DocSane> ingwaz: Why not? It was interesting.
<OneTrickPony> night Dken2021
<Ninjazz> Well... The plane design is WW1, but the ships and weapons are most WW2-ish.
<Sumica> 00,10Irohman gives no damn about your bombs
<ingwaz> DocSane: interesting but tedious, and as others have said, pretty pointless. and its late, and i have work in 6 hours
<Flare> ...
<Flare> ?
<DocSane> ingwaz: What point is there to IRC if not to debate absurd minutiae?
<Flare> GOD damnit..
<Meanwhile> Sumica: I take it you've seen that picture huh?
<Sumica> 00,10Just a few of them
<glennglog22> hi
<Ninjazz> Hello there.
<LightNight> there is no hope
<LightNight> i wish they would put her there again
<LightNight> and find a real way out
<LightNight> i dont think anyone realizes how bad this life is
<ingwaz> DocSane: i'm not going to resopnd to that, because i just about did with a debate
<FlareChaser> ..
<Alchemist> too much cofee. hands are shaking. and im grinding my teeth.
<ingwaz> DocSane: NOT AGAIN
<Meanwhile> Bumi is best commander.
<ingwaz> Alchemist: thats bad for your teeth
<Ninjazz> Actually Dick Shep is best commander. :I
<OtakuTom> I'm sorry...DocSane's comment about IRC just made me laugh XD
<Alchemist> ingwaz: i know, it will go away soon :D
<OtakuTom> It reminds me of an XKCD comic
<ingwaz> http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/duty_calls.png
<ingwaz> that one OtakuTom?
<OtakuTom> eeyup
<ingwaz> OtakuTom: yep, i showed that on here earlier...
<DocSane> Disclosure: I get invited to cons as a guest to have panels exactly like this debate.
<CrimsonPhoenix> what?
<CrimsonPhoenix> EQD posted that twice
<Gamer_Luna> I FIXED STEVEN!Hey everypony :)
<xmasskills> Gamer_Luna: hai
<DocSane> So you might notice that I like to debate and analyze.
<ingwaz> CrimsonPhoenix: suspected its because the original post showed the video, which was supposed to be after the break
<CrimsonPhoenix> I like this hobo
<OtakuTom> lol...whatnow, Gamer_Luna?
<Om> Gamer_Luna: Hi there, having fun I'd hope
<Meanwhile> Allo Gamer_Luna.
<Gamer_Luna> Steven is my Laptp :D
<DocSane> Anyway, good night, everyone.
<OtakuTom> Ah
<Sumica> 00,10that whole walking under water thing must be a trip
<LightNight> analyze wat i should do
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Gamer_Luna.
<LightNight> aww
<Ninjazz> Gnight, DocSane. Take care.
<DocSane> Later, all.
<LightNight> see ya
<Alchemist> bye DocSane
<CrimsonPhoenix> DUN DUN DUUUUUN
<OneTrickPony> story time!!!!
<Meanwhile> Gasp
<MahBoi777> *le gasp*
<CrimsonPhoenix> seriously that shocked me
<Ninjazz> He bends... How?...
<Meanwhile> Plastic surgery
<Ninjazz> Plastic surgery in this time and age?... Medical science advances ALOT in 100 years.
<DashieMusic2> i havent watched this show in a long time... whats a blood bender?
<ingwaz> the correct question is, will it bend?
<CrimsonPhoenix> blood bender blends blood
<Meanwhile> DashieMusic2: A water bender who can bend blood in a similar fashion
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ninjazz: well there was a 100 year war and it should had stopped technologic advance a bit
<Sumica> 00,10DashieMusic2, they are advanced water benders
<CrimsonPhoenix> bends**
<ingwaz> CrimsonPhoenix: http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120201175507/fantendo/images/thumb/4/48/You_dont_say.png/453px-You_dont_say.png
<OtakuTom> Just like how metal bending is an advanced form of earth bending.
<DashieMusic2> well that explains it
<Meanwhile> Way more rarer than metal bending
<CrimsonPhoenix> ingwaz, don't EVER use that stupid picture at me
<Meanwhile> Metal bending can be learned by any earth bender
<Ninjazz> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: True. True. And since the water benders are the Healers of the world and they were losing, it only makes sense.
<Meanwhile> Blood bending is a trait you have to possess.
<Ninjazz> isn't he the Fire Emperor?! :O
<ingwaz> yeah, i dont really care for orders from those who are not my superiors CrimsonPhoenix
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Great now there will be no Cow level :'(
<CK|Basara> ....
<ingwaz> CrimsonPhoenix: i'll respond reasonably to requests, but not so much to orders
<CK|Basara> This game is a silly filly
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well then please don't use that picture again
<CrimsonPhoenix> towards me
<OneTrickPony> D'aawwwww
<Ninjazz> Dance, puppets! Dance!
<OtakuTom> Dances with wolves!
<ingwaz> CrimsonPhoenix: i'll try to remember that, but if i do then youll have to excuse me. i like to be snarky for fun
<Ninjazz> His stare...
<Ninjazz> It's way too OP.
<OneTrickPony> Bow to me
<MahBoi777> indeed
<CrimsonPhoenix> ingwaz, it's jsut I despise reddit and every joke they trash down to oblivion
<CrimsonPhoenix> just**
<ingwaz> CrimsonPhoenix: i just have fun with it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think I'll trade away my flaming boxes.
<Sumica> 00,10I know Shamroc wants em
<ingwaz> CrimsonPhoenix: i dont really go on reddit either so its entirely possible if i were to send you another link at some point you might have seen it and come to hate it because of reddit
<Ninjazz> I wonder how getting Blood Bended feels like...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can he give me keys for them?
<ingwaz> Ninjazz: uhh...like sunshine and rainbows?
<Shamroc> Sumica: nope already got a pair
<Meanwhile> Big brother, best friend forever
<ingwaz> Ninjazz: kind of like how the pyro sees the world
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: nope.jpg
<Shamroc> Sumica: and i doubt i'll be gettin more money to get more
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: probably like a bee sting to the eyeball
*Ninjazz scratches his eye at that thought
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dick move of Valve to do that TBH.
<Meanwhile> That's what valve do all the time though.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, what do you mean?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: Well its Trade Fortress 2
<Sumica> 00,10what did they do?
<CrimsonPhoenix> about the whole gender still being a mystery?
<Meanwhile> They've been doing it every christmas since the shop opened.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I LOVE them doing that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Craft drop items into something you have to pay to unlock.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh
<Sumica> 00,10ah
<CrimsonPhoenix> that sounds bullshit
<Ninjazz> It does sound kinda dick-ish. But you ain't being forced.
<Ninjazz> Just... encouraged.
<LightNight> anyone have any videos or pics that can cheer me up?
<ACS13123> HI :)
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeeeerp
<Ninjazz> Hey there, ACS13123.
<Alister> If this is book one , does that mean the show will get more seasons ?
<MahBoi777> hey ACS13123
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Alister: just 2 seasons
<Ninjazz> HOPEFULLY, Alister.
<OtakuTom> Alister: The series was planned to be more than 1 season long.
<SolairePony89> Kinda sounds like Steve Blum
<SolairePony89> Kinda
<CrimsonPhoenix> SolairePony89, it's Steve Blum
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> it is Steve Blum lol
<SolairePony89> :D x 50
<SolairePony89> <3 Steve Blum
<Ninjazz> o__o

<CK|Basara> This finale should have been awesome, but with all the Deus Ex, I dislike it more every time I think about it. :/

<CK|Basara> That's a good bomb drop
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> This is the only good show on Nick Currently
<Ninjazz> Not the Faec.
<Kencolt> This is, seriously, one of the most over-the-top action scenes in US animation EVER.
<CK|Basara> Crimson: Haven't seen the finale I take it?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Kencolt: ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> I did
<OneTrickPony> Emon is avatar Ang!??!?!
<CK|Basara> Then you should know the deus ex in this ep already. p
<CK|Basara> *:P
<RyunosukeKnT> nope
<Meanwhile> OneTrickPony: Actually he just stuck that mask over the statue for giggles.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just don't get that expression
<CrimsonPhoenix> ever
<Ninjazz> Even in the future, Zuko and Ang are still friends. Friendship.

<Flutterfly> giant dog?
<Chimera> Yay I returned

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wind beats everything
<junh1024-XD> even it i reencode the english audio, i still can't fit this on a BD23 =\
<CK|Basara> And with three elements, she can't touch him. But one element? TOTALLY ENOUGH.
<CrimsonPhoenix> to be honest CK|Basara I enjoyed that sudden wind bending
<CK|Basara> :3
<OneTrickPony> fake scar is fake
<Meanwhile> Nice going numbnuts
<CrimsonPhoenix> CK SURPRISED
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> that Wah face
<CK|Basara> Crimson: It makes no sense in any real context. :p
<Ninjazz> He dun goofed.
<Sumica> 00,10still say he should have used lighting
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ninjazz: IKR
<MahBoi777> burn his ass
<Ninjazz> All is well in Union City.
<CK|Basara> Eh, too much water. The charge would've never touched him.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: then wouldnt the whole area be electrified killing fish
<CK|Basara> Even in salt water, a little bolt like firebenders use wouldn't electrocute that much water.
<Sumica> 00,10saltwater would conduct just fine to keep him from geting far
<CrimsonPhoenix> CK|Basara, I'm not comfortable with you...
<CK|Basara> Not enough of a charge.
<Kencolt> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I could go for some fish.

<CK|Basara> Almost.

<CK|Basara> But still a solid redemption moment.

<Meanwhile> It's going to be alr-"nope"
<Sumica> 00,10only no one knows of the remdetion
<CK|Basara> Actually Korra, yes, it WILL be alright, because deus ex number two is still coming up
<Meanwhile> remdetion?
<Meanwhile> lol
<ponibas> remediateion, I am guessing
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok here's my tw bits
<ponibas> bleh...
<Meanwhile> Redemption, I think.
<ponibas> remediation
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm ok with the sudden air bending
<Kencolt> Sumica: Seppuku , in this case, by explosion, is a very private thing. Well, except for the very loud noise.
<CK|Basara> Sumica: Pft, WE know. That's all that matters.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but that deus ex number 2 I could go without
<ponibas> maybe. i don't know the syntax
<RyunosukeKnT> doh that buffer

<Ninjazz> I'm ganna slap you softly, Korra.
<Meanwhile> My parents wouldn't approve if I married a loading screen.
<Ninjazz> XD
<MahBoi777> :D
<Tovler> Yep, it will take time. so much time.
<CK|Basara> It'll take exactly a minute of time
<Sumica> 00,10yep a good 3 min
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: better than mine
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Whoa dat skip

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wth
<CK|Basara> o.O
<Rain> inb4 deus ex machina
<Meanwhile> What is going on.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol funny
<CK|Basara> Well that was random.
<DashieMusic2> replay?
<Kencolt> The Tardis done gone broke on us.
<OneTrickPony> Tenson is now Ang?!? so many plot twists!
<drf|laptop> 03junh1024-XD, BD Rebuilder?
<drf|laptop> 03or just buy some burnable DLs
<pony_2720> i just joined and what did i miss?
<OtakuTom> deja vu! someone is hacking the matrix!
<CrimsonPhoenix> everything?
<CK|Basara> Rain: This deus ex makes me SO mad, too.
<CK|Basara> Because it is TOTALLY unnecessary.
<Meanwhile> Eh, I'm less inclined to consider this a deus ex because the avatar state is a pretty well established thing.
<dshannon> aang is still best avatar
<CrimsonPhoenix> CK|Basara, I could agree on you with THAT one
<pony_373> Actually, if you think about it hard, the blood bending is what caused the benders to lose one's bending. So by using energy bending, it can restore back. It isn't like what Aang did to the Fire Lord
<Tovler> I loved the gif where Aang is Nigel.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I still nod to the sudden air bending
<Ninjazz> It's ANG!
<mario_pony> wow
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: I've come to the view that it's NOT a Deus Ex, but a part of the Avatar Process.
<OneTrickPony> Tenson is best Aang
<RyunosukeKnT> suddenly Aang, Kyoshi and Roku
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ITS AAAAAAAAAAANG
*Ninjazz squees
<MahBoi777> HUZZAH
<CK|Basara> Aang: "So I'll be taking your airbending now."
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Roku =D
<Irish_Pony> o_O
<Rain> indurring element pulses
<dshannon> :'(
<OtakuTom> Damn...adult Aang...master of deus ex bending
<Om> And then she op'd
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: No, the avatar process was clearly shown and described in TLA.
<Reikim> Are we watching the finale then?
<OneTrickPony> dat avatar state
<Ninjazz> Korra just went full avatar.
<CK|Basara> This is Aang giving her all of her powers back because YAY HAPPY ENDING.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Reikim: no we're watching the pilot
<CK|Basara> It's *bullshit*.
<Meanwhile> Yeah well, kids channel.
<Tovler> you never go full avatar
<Reikim> Well I missed it, but hey, I've already seen it.
<Meanwhile> What ya gonna do
<mario_pony> :')
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: Was it? I think that Avatar barely scrtached the durface... and it's not always going to be same from incarnation to incarnation.
<Reikim> Korra is, quite honestly, my favourite character.
<OtakuTom> And then they made all the babies
<Rain> I would prefer if she got with the other brother, and not that one
<OneTrickPony> wat
<Om> Almost way to much happened in the first season. @~@
<Reikim> I agree with Rain. Bolin is awesome.
<CK|Basara> Meanwhile: In TLA, this would've been dealt with by sending him on some sort of spiritual journey. :P
<junh1024-XD> how about,,, reeencoding it to QP0 ?
<OneTrickPony> yayz
<Sumica> 00,10wait for stream to catch up then killing it to clear cache
<somepony_else> ohai everypony!
<ACS13123> 0o0
<Tovler> No Tigertortoise required
<OneTrickPony> hai somepony_else
<Meanwhile> CK|Basara: Not enough airtime
<TrixieBaconMuffin> You are now a full avatar , even thoug you only got lucky in your fights and never learnd anything!
<CK|Basara> They have a second season, that's plenty of time.
<OneTrickPony> now we watch Angel Beats
<dshannon> which would make for a badass second season
<MahBoi777> DAWWWWWWWWWWWW
<xxMoopyxx> Hey guys heh i just watched the goodest stuff i ever saw hahahahaha
<CK|Basara> They're the ones who chose to bind themselves to a 12-ep miniseries.
<DashieMusic2> awwwww
<Tovler> Season 2 is gonna end up like Matrix Reloaded.
<CrimsonPhoenix> But CK|Basara I'm still ok with that sudden airbending
<Meanwhile> CK|Basara: Guess you should tell them that. :s
<CK|Basara> When they could have walked into Nick's offices and picked their choice of season length. >_>
<pony_373> I saw the air bending coming from a mile away, to tell you the truth lol
<junh1024-XD> hm, mb the BD is a bit darker than the ITUNES
<xxMoopyxx> oh man it was good i mean holy crap it was amazing
<pony_373> But it was good :P
<junh1024-XD> credits aren't redone, my memory was wrong
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: Or maybe it's that she didn'tNEED a Spiritual Journey. UNlike Aang, who until nearly the end, Korra was never conflicted about being the Avatar. She mere was frustrated at not quite getting Airbending.
<junh1024-XD> but both have some film jitter

<xxMoopyxx> whoooo!
<OtakuTom> I'm still a little upset that it's gone by this fast. There's only 14 episodes left now.
<CK|Basara> Crimson: I'm really not. They don't explain it, which is part of what annoys me. Supposedly Amon took her bending ability, she should not be able to suddenly develop bending again.
<xxMoopyxx> wow weee
<Om> Spanish Inquisition?
<Reikim> So what's this, ooh?
<Ninjazz> It's Blood Moon.
<pony_373> Amon used "blood bending" to take the bending away
<Om> No I was wrong.
<Meanwhile> Oh hey it's that weird show with the sponsored heroes.
<Tovler> If it wasn't for the "I was born knowing 3 elements" part. I'd've been annoyed by the sudden airbending.
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: She never had to do half the stuff Aang did, that's part of the problem. :p
<xxMoopyxx> Nothing don't worry about it
<Reikim> Why does this sound like...
<pony_373> Now, look at Aang's case against the fire lord. He used energybending to do that, which is more fatal than the blood bending
<mario_pony> :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Japanese Batman?
<mario_pony> what a twist
<drf|laptop> 03so
<junh1024-XD> drf|laptop some screens http://imgur.com/a/OkSqq
<pony_373> The other thing to remember is that there are going to be other books to get more in detail with the plot lol. This isn't the only book that's in the sequel >.>
<xxMoopyxx> No hahahaha
<ponibas> Japanese Ronald McDonald!!
<drf|laptop> 03FMA's going to buy me ~15 Pokémon phone charms
<xxMoopyxx> no
<ponibas> Sumica knows what I mean
<drf|laptop> 03they're Pikachu + random 5th gens
<drf|laptop> 03I figure I can give some away
<AttackWithHugs> Subliminal messages?
<ponibas> hot_luna is hot?
<OtakuTom> I think if they had extended it to a 39 episode (3 season) series, they could have pushed this arc to 2 seasons to really give more conflict between the benders and the separatists.
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: Unlocking chakras? Nope. Train elements on-screen? Silly viewer, we'll do three of them off-screen and barely allude to the fourth. Aang had a damn tough journey, Korra played in Easy Mode.
<Sumica> 00,10Ran ran ruuu?
<xxMoopyxx> Nope not even close
<ponibas> rang ramg?
<pony_373> CK|Basara: Actually, we don't know that for sure since we don't see that
<drf|laptop> 03WMP can play BD?
<Sumica> 00,10pay no mind korra was training from lie 4 to be the avatar
<CK|Basara> I think the real issue with Korra is that it tried to do too much.
<pony_373> CK|Basara: We were only shown on what she was doing in training as an air bender
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well Korra IS older than Angg?
<CK|Basara> pony_373: which was very, very little
<CK|Basara> She did some footwork exercises, and....what else?
<pony_373> Mentality
<CK|Basara> When?
<xxMoopyxx> Well i hate to tell this in the chatroom but here it goes the video i was watching called Jenny and Niki first kiss hahahahahahahahah
<CK|Basara> They spent the next several eps on that tournament. :P
<pony_373> Remember, Tenzen showed that in order to master air bending, she needed to be patient
<junh1024-XD> no, but it can play m2ts if you anydvd and remuxed BD into mkv if you haali
<CK|Basara> Yeah, and she never showed patience.
<CK|Basara> Ever.
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: That's the POINT. Aang was NOT a complete Avatar-- because he was conflicted at the start, and didn't until the end truly accept that. (He also skipped his training and instead took a 100 year icenap.) Korra, OTOH< is a nearly complete Avatar, skilled, accepting, and in a rather different world. Different situation. Different evrything. Also, she sure as heck aint a 12 year old.
<xxMoopyxx> sorry about hat
<ponibas> why are they shutting down teh TF2 items server??
<OtakuTom> True...they could have spent the first season focusing on airbending and the pro bending circuit, then introduced the separatists in the 2nd season and really pushed their conflict the whole time...
<pony_373> Plus, look on the rest of the episodes. There are some parts that she had to work with to becoming an air bender. One of them was in the tourny episode
<xxMoopyxx> i don't want to go any farther then that
<CK|Basara> See: her decision to confront Amon directly instead of helping Iroh destroy the airfield, because "she has to do this on her terms". That's the exact OPPOSITE of patience and forethought.
<xxMoopyxx> but it was great
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: And almost exactly how Aang would have handled it. He was BIG on that very often.
<pony_373> But if you think about it, the threat was Amon. He had the ability to take away the bending
<Cobellanez> Goodnight everyone!
<Om> Night Coolbeanz
<junh1024-XD> wellhm, not exactly a fair comparison since i did denosing on my rip, but BD should have more detail anyway ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<Cobellanez> :s
<somepony_else> gnight Cobellanez
<junh1024-XD> *denoising
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: You just changed arguments.
<Om> :)
<Tovler> Korra sucks at the spiritual aspect of bending, I hope that somehow plays into season 2, although her spiritual bending goes against my hope.
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: No. Korra IS Aang reborn. Similar personalities... at times. But in a very very different situation.
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: From "Aang is an incomplete avatar without training so he's a bad role model to base Korra on" to "and he's the perfect example of how Korra should act".
<CK|Basara> Those are two entirely opposite stances.
<CK|Basara> You're welcome to pick one, but not both. :p
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: At the end-- he was. I repeat-- Korra was prepared, Aang, until late, denied.
<CK|Basara> No she wasn't!
<CrimsonPhoenix> this debate is going to go on for hours right?
<Meanwhile> This debate is daft.
<Reikim> Meanwhile has the right of it.
<CK|Basara> No part of her plan showed forethought. She charged into a giant meeting of anti-bender people and tried to convince them to listen to her. :P
<CK|Basara> She's a grade-A dumbass.
<Reikim> OKay then
<Reikim> I think it's late
<CK|Basara> ....did that girl just ride blue fire?
<Reikim> if we're pulling out the name-calling
<pony_373> Well think about one thing: The only thing Amon had was that he was basically scarred by the fire benders and that's how he became
<Om> I'm a grade C Dumbass
<Tovler> Amon's a water bender. Amon: No I'm not. Plan foiled.
<Kencolt> ck Both stances are the same stance. Korra really knew more about being an Avatar than Aang did. She was dealing with a wall-- as Aang did. She tried to convince people opposed to her to listen-- just as Aang Did. This is NOT being Dumb. THis is being an Avatar-- the embodiment of Balance.
<pony_373> If Amon didn't have the scars, then he would of been completely wrong
<mario_pony> xD
<Kencolt> pony_373: Um... he DIDN'T have the scars, it was a lie, and they were makeup.
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: Except that Aang did it in situations where he had an opportunity to succeed. Korra didn't. >_>
<pony_373> Kencolt: No. What I mean is that what Ck said. He said Korra was dumb by just charging in like that, but the thing is, she wasn't expecting a makeup under that mask
<Kencolt> Feh, we can't see eye to eye here.
<CK|Basara> pony_373: Eh, even without the scars, it's the word of their leader against the word of THE symbol of opposition from benders
<CK|Basara> Not exactly much of a contest
<Reikim> Ah, the Batman argument...
<xxMoopyxx> Hey dude you know that video called pinkie pills?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Thanks for the game Shizuka ~
<Reikim> Yeah, thanks Shizuka
<Meanwhile> Time to stop putting bed off.
<xxMoopyxx> it was cool
<Meanwhile> G'night everypony.
<Sylandest> the machine reminds me of Navi...
<Sylandest> night Meanwhile!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Meanwhile
<CK|Basara> Kencolt: No, likely not. I'm severely disappointed in the way they did this season. It's still good....but it's like different people picked up TLA and said "we can do better"....and didn't. :/

<Reikim> Pepsi Nex
<Reikim> Sure
<xxMoopyxx> Man if i had a job like you guys and do the stream i would show you guys something really cool
<CK|Basara> Anyways, agree to disagree. :P
<CK|Basara> o.O
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: I see it as rather, "We can do different-- 80+ years later?" They aren't trying to tell the same story, after all.
<Kencolt> CK|Basara: My view, I guess.
<CK|Basara> Well it's certainly different. But other than the much improved animation....it feels like such lost potential.
<CK|Basara> Ah well.
<xxMoopyxx> So how do you guys do the stream anyway?
<CK|Basara> Maybe next season will surprise me
<CK|Basara> Will be hard to top comedian Amon, though.
<CK|Basara> ....you know, I get the sense this game left all forms of logic at the door.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: So I took a waterbender's bending away the other day. And I said "Cry me a river! Oh wait, you can't!" ... Well I thought it was funny.

<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: very very fun ;)
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: -lol
<CK|Basara> I'm playing a game in which this character is wielding six swords at the same time (three full-sized katana per hand).
<Reikim> CK|Basara: So I took an airbender's powers the other day...told him "You've been naughty. Now you're grounded!" ... Well I thought it was funny.
<xxMoopyxx> And you don't want to know
<Sumica> 00,10Show is "tiger and bunny"
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Sengoku BAsara?
<CK|Basara> ....and I just picked up a new set of katanas that has THREE blades.
<Irish_Pony> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6bcdipV4C1rs5n2bo1_1280.gif
<Reikim> CK|Basara: That's a total of 9 blades per hand, or 18 blades.
<CK|Basara> So....that's sort of difficult to understand ._.
<CK|Basara> Reikim: Indeeds
<Rukario> i0i
<CK|Basara> Date Masamune is just that much of a badass.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Sengoku Basara is that kind of game.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47 did i make you tired last night?
<CK|Basara> Reikim: I know. The anime's pretty hilariously bizarre too
<Ninjazz> Irish_Pony: I'm saving that.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Just wait until you get the laser blades. That have giant motorcycle exhausts as sheaths.
<Ninjazz> Cause Rarity <3
<Ponies47> xxMoopyxx: Nope.avi
<Irish_Pony> Ninjazz: :P
<xxMoopyxx> Oh ok
<Om> Ninjazz: So easy to please xD
<MahBoi777> lol
<OtakuTom> Reikim: So I took away a firebender's power about a week ago...now he just seems to have lost his spark. He tried to show me that he still had them, but it was all just smoke and mirrors.
<Ninjazz> Om: You say that and you keep bringing me Trixie. :|
<Om> Ninjazz: Yes. Because its fun.
<xxMoopyxx> yo sweetie bell whats up? hows the trying to get a cutie mark coming along?
<Ninjazz> Grrrr.
<Ninjazz> :T
<Om> Ninjazz: I should draw a Rarity Trixie ship picture fr you. What do ya think hmm?
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Ninjazz> -__-
<CK|Basara> Reikim: But then, in a show featuring a giant cyborg with a drill lance, a man who wields two scythes at the same time, and a guy wields a shotgun in one hand and a sword in another....I suppose you really HAVE to just give in to the crazy to make a show out of that.
<MahBoi777> hey Polydunami!
<Ninjazz> make sure it's sexy, atleast. >.>
<Kencolt> OK. And that said it all. Lunatic.
<Polydunami> Hey MahBoi777 :3
<Ninjazz> AND DAT Polydunami!
<Polydunami> Hey Ninjazz ;)
<CK|Basara> And man, does it EVER make a show out of it.
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Reikim> CK|Basara: "So I met the Wolfbats the other day, and I asked them 'hey, why do you cheat?' And they said, 'Oh, we don't break the rules. We BEND them.'" *silence* "Well I thought it was funny."
<Om> Ninjazz: Like I said, easy to please :D
<Ninjazz> Om: Shaddap. >.>
<MahBoi777> LOL
<xxMoopyxx> Hey hang on a minute ponies47 im going to back out cause the broadcast is offline on my screen here
<CK|Basara> Reikim: So people were saying how I died in the finale, but the truth is, I'm still AMONgst you. ....well, I thought it was funny.
<Ninjazz> CK|Basara: I want to kick myself for laughing at that.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Then you get women who can pull infinite pistols, shotguns, and rocket launchers out of nowhere, and massive tiger guys who can make their horses run up walls...yah.
<Reikim> *yeah
<xxMoopyxx> there we go
<Kencolt> Reikim: "So, I met the Avatar, and I.. Um.. well, it didn't take. I don't know why. And then my brother blew me up. Big time. Oh, I got nothing."
<CK|Basara> Reikim: There's only one horse that matters and that's the motorcycle horse.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: God yes.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: All arguments invalidated.
<Om> Kencolt: You just need the right elements for the joke.
<CK|Basara> http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/horsemotor_3327.JPG
<Alchemist> im off to go to my exam.will be back sometime afternoon. goodbye everyone!
<CK|Basara> Best horse.
<grooviebones> gl
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Alchemist. Take care and good luck. :)
<Sumica> 00,10totaly not the bad guy >_>
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Apparently I don't have access?
<CK|Basara> If I ever owned a horse, it would have to be that one.
<Ponies47> Night Alchemist! :)
<LightNight> bye
<Polydunami> Things I've learned from Doctor Who: cave people who lived 100,000 years ago speak slightly broken British English :S
<CK|Basara> Reikim: wut O.o
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Yeah, I click and it says I can't go.
<Sumica> 00,10I think sleep is a good idea.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Oh, never mind
<Sumica> 00,10I am gonna try it
<grooviebones> what's sleep?
<CK|Basara> That's bizarre. I literally just pulled it off of Google search. XD
<Reikim> Sumica: It's not all it's cracked up to be, but it can be fun on occasion.
<Polydunami> Yeah, I think I'm finally getting into Doctor Who :$
<Kencolt> I still think, on that pic, there is soething... off... about Filly Rarity's tail.
<OtakuTom> Polydunami: Isn't that just due to the universal translator from the TARDIS?
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Motorbike horse. No other horse needed.
<Pony> good night
<Reikim> Good night, Sumica. Thanks for Korra!
<somepony_else> good night Sumica :)
<Polydunami> Really? I'm going from the beginning :3
<CK|Basara> I should probably sleep too. On the other hand, one more round of Basara would be nice, and I'm aching to kick Yukimura's sorry ass.
<Ninjazz> Thanks for the stream, Sumi. Sleep well. :)
<Polydunami> Rather, I started at the beginning with the First Doctor.
<grooviebones> with so many different doctors and so many seasons, it's a little late for me to get into who, just don't want to put the time into it
<Reikim> CK|Basara: Kick his ass. Then kick...what's his name, the purple emo guy. It's fun to beat him up.
<Dead_Luna> Took a pic of myself,look horrible :D
<OtakuTom> I was about to ask which beginning...lol
<CK|Basara> Mitsunari? He's such a emo that other emos look at him and go "dude, tone it down"
<Kencolt> Polydunami: And thyey DID explain much of that during season one and two of Dr Who Classic. Yeah, seens those that survived.
<OtakuTom> I hate to say it, but I've only seen 9th doctor and after.
<Polydunami> I'm not too far into the show, just in the middle of the first Dalek serial.
<Om> What came first, the avatar or the bending?
<Ninjazz> Bending.
<Reikim> CK|Basara: On the other hand, it's HILARIOUS when he breaks down. Such ham-fisted acting.
<CK|Basara> Okee, time for asskicking. :3
<Polydunami> Also, I wish I was alive to see those episodes which are missing :(
<CK|Basara> That's true.
<MahBoi777> Om: both?:$
<Om> MahBoi777: Seems legit
<Polydunami> Or is it that instead of which?
<OtakuTom> There tends to be one lost episode that is found every year...lol
<Polydunami> Bah.
<Reikim> All right then. I think I'll follow Sumi's lead and try out sleeping for once. Night, everybody.
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Reikim. take care. :)
<MahBoi777> gnight Reikim
<grooviebones> it's only one where i am, early yet
<Polydunami> Hopefully that Tenth Planet episode can be found.
<Polydunami> The one where the Doctor regenerates for the first time
<hen3ry> meh. Sleep is for people who don't have to write an article. :/

<OtakuTom> Hey Polydunami...I'm trying to remember...do you play Minecraft?
<Polydunami> Quite minimalistic, the animation.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami, it's an animatic
<grooviebones> wow those response videos
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not complete
<Polydunami> Also, I don't have the full version of Minecraft
<Polydunami> Sometimes I fool around in Minecraft Classic, but that's whenever I'm bored.
<Polydunami> Which is pretty much all day :3
<sonicrainboomer259|b> ok, pyro is smoking pot

<OtakuTom> Gah...I just found out what appeared to be a mod is only clever editing...but someone is actually working on making this a real mod... http://youtu.be/wKBSWY2jnGw

<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate!
<Polydunami> Good evening, MadSurge :3
<xxMoopyxx> Uh hes hes like a bear hes like a bear that hates people!
<sonicrainboomer259|b> MadSurge: very late at night here in sunny florida :P
<Polydunami> Also, you talking about an actual time travel mod?
<MadSurge> sonicrainboomer259|b: in Italy it's almost 9 AM :D
<Polydunami> I wonder HOW that would be useful in a game like Minecraft :S
<OtakuTom> Not a time travel mod, but a fully functional TARDIS
<xxMoopyxx> Minecraft sucks for me only
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Sweetie_Belle> back
<Polydunami> But that's the Doctor's TARDIS
<MahBoi777> mornin MadSurge!
<MadSurge> Morning MahBoi777!
<Sweetie_Belle> its 12:56 here :P
<Polydunami> I mean, as far as I know, only The Doctor's TARDIS is stuck in police box form.
<OtakuTom> Yes, but that doesn't mean that others can't make theirs look like that, either.
<Polydunami> Oh hey Sweetie_Belle, is that noon or midnight?
<OtakuTom> Plus, it's what we all know and recognize, so why not make it look like that in the mod once it's made?
<Sweetie_Belle> midnight -.-
<Sweetie_Belle> i woke up from my bro
<Polydunami> I suppose
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: =D
*DeathStar dances
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: -lol you are my favorite filly <3
<Sweetie_Belle> he had a nightmire and started shaking my bunkbed
<Sweetie_Belle> >.>
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: Also I think yesterday you PM'd me saying hello. Were you going to ask for soemthing?
<Iron_Edge> Or it might have been the day before...cant remember
<Shamroc> whats the next trilogy?
<Sweetie_Belle> iron_edge: i just like to chat...i get bored allot -.-
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: But you picked me at complete random?
<OtakuTom> I think BTTF would have been good...seeing as June 27 is the major date that the movie revolves around :P
<OneTrickPony> K I'm back
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: Also type in the first part of my name "Iron" then press tab. It'll help you ping -lol
<OtakuTom> Or at least it is IIRC.
<Iron_Edge> OneTrickPony: Sup bro /)
<grooviebones> oh guess what movie comes out on my birthday
<grooviebones> magic mike!
<OneTrickPony> hey Iron_Edge (\
<Sweetie_Belle> iron_edge: i wanted to know if you had seen Gamer_Luna
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: Who are you? Like what did you change your name from?
<Polydunami> I dunno about that June 27th thing.
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: Or are you brand new here/
<MahBoi777> hey Iron_Edge, how are ya?
<Iron_Edge> ?
<Dead_Luna> http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/art/Me-311194194

<MahBoi777> good good ^_^
<Ninjazz> Ohey there, Iron_Edge.
<Polydunami> I've never heard of ANY Back to the Future movie referencing the date of June 27th, 2012.
<Sweetie_Belle> Iron_Edge: Apple_Bloom,but some one took my name DX
<OtakuTom> derp...it's November 5...there's some scifi movie that has events on June 27
<Ponies47> Wait is the stream down now? I'm getting nothing 6_9
<OtakuTom> It wasn't specific to 2012
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: Sup there....-lol trixie lover.
<OtakuTom> My friend had the movie wrong,
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: It may be passcoded.
<Om> Woah
<OtakuTom> I thought June 27 sounded wrong...lol
<Sweetie_Belle> Iron_Edge: why?
<Sweetie_Belle> :(
<Ninjazz> Iron_Edge: What did you just call me? :|
<Iron_Edge> Sweetie_Belle: Depending on how you spell out your name chracters from the show are blocked form being used.
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: I was lurking and happened to catch a chat with you and somepony else...
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: Seems to me like you trixie and rarity have a thing XD
*Ninjazz feels his eye twitch
<Ninjazz> Damn it.
<Iron_Edge> -lol
<Ninjazz> I'll choose my words carefully from now on... :|
<Om> Iron_Edge: Draw eeet :3
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: I mean I didnt think anything of it at first till' om offered to draw it and you requested that he "make it sexy"
<Ninjazz> But I know myself enough to know that I won't be doing that. *sighs*
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: -lol you sorta fell into that backstab XD
<Ninjazz> Iron_Edge: Just for the chance to see Om draw sexy Rarity... yeah, I'll tolerate that Trixie for a second. >.>
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: I personally dont see whats so bad about trixie. Sure she show boated but dont we all at some point? -lol
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: If anypony deserves hate I'd say diamond tiara. She i made of bitch.
<Iron_Edge> is*
<Ninjazz> Oh I hate her.
<grooviebones> i verily dislike trixie
<Iron_Edge> grooviebones: Why though?
<Ninjazz> But Diamond Tiara doesn't have a TON of fans.
<Iron_Edge> What did trixie actually do foreal that caused anypony any real distress?
<grooviebones> she's an antagonist for a reason, her showboating makes it easy to generally dislike her
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: diamond tiara made applebloom doubt her own family
<Ninjazz> Trixie gets love for being a villain when other ponies like Celestia get hate. Why?
<grooviebones> i don't hate her or anything i just dislike her
<Om> Ninjazz: You are lucky I don't have confdence in Drawing anything "sexy" as you put it.
<MahBoi777> Gilda is worst pony
<Iron_Edge> MahBoi777: Agreed
<OneTrickPony> lulz http://rbug2006.deviantart.com/art/Meanwhile-at-the-Super-Awesome-Book-Base-310880150
<Ninjazz> Om: You decided to do it, my friend. It's all you. >:3
<Iron_Edge> MahBoi777: Anypony who makes fluttershy cry is on my kill list >:3
<MahBoi777> YES
<Om> Ninjazz: I was jokeing ._.
<Ninjazz> Eh. I don't care too much about Flutters either.
<MahBoi777> OneTrickPony: Rave tiem?
<MahBoi777> xD
<OneTrickPony> MahBoi777: yup
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: Celestia was kind of a let down to me personally
<Ninjazz> Om: Wait... What?
<Polydunami> OneTrickPony, the title tells me that Meanwhile is at the Super Awesome Book Base :3
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: How the hell does the pony that RAISES THE BUCKIN SUN lose to one ponys love???
<Om> Ninjazz: What?
<OneTrickPony> Polydunami: XD
<hen3ry> It's the Worf Effect. Only way to show an enemy is SRS BZNS is to have them defeat your strongest ally.
<Ninjazz> Iron_Edge: Eh. Just because she raises the sun doesn't make he invicivble as many would LOVE to claim... Well, that was obvious.
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: So then the ancient goddess ...sucks...basically?
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: The ancient creator......sucks

<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: Yeah but for like what? a year or so then they decided to get married?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai ^-^
<hen3ry> To be fair, Celestia can curbstomp basically anypony... except Discord or Chrysalis-powered-by-Shiny.
<Polydunami> Wait, who said Celestia was a freaking GODDESS!?
<Ninjazz> Iron_Edge: Does that even matter?
<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: Celestia has been around since grannysmiths day and before then.
<DashieMusic2> are we still streaming?
<CrimsonPhoenix> aaaaaaand bed time for me

<Iron_Edge> Ninjazz: She didnt put up a real good fight anyways. :/ would have liked to see more from ol' Tia
<Iron_Edge> CrimsonPhoenix: Later bro /)

<Applejazz> Iron_Edge: We can't EVERYTHING can we? As much as I loved Rarity CQC <3 I would have liked to see Celestia actually have a damn chance to be loved by the majority of fans instead of being everypony's favorite target for trolling.

<Ninjazz> valoreins: That's not awkward. Try knowing the entire story of Amnesia but being too scared to play it.
<Irish_Pony> valoreins: that was me until it became free :P luckily I watched so many videos before it so I was an instant pro :)
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/D-gfjyqPQLw

<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: I suck at it, but it's amazing.
<FairysHuff> valoreins: Huh?
<valoreins> Mutterguy: i know dat feel, i have that song in my laptop :s
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Same. Can't wait for the new one. Hope they don't screw it up.

<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: The FPS? I'm more excited for a spiritual successor called Xenonaughts.
<Polydunami> Hey Ninjazz, does this look like a 22-year-old man to you? http://imgur.com/XzHYp
<FairysHuff> valoreins: Meh. *Shrugs*
<Irish_Pony> Polydunami: dat pedofile

<Ninjazz> yes, he does, Polydunami. Who is that stranger? :D
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Didn't you know? O_O Theres a remake of the original X-Com. NOT the fps. The fps has been put on hold indeffinately
<Polydunami> Irish_Pony, who's a pedophile?
<Polydunami> Hm?
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: Oh, yes! I remember! I'm still more excited for the other game.
<Irish_Pony> Polydunami: the pic of the guy you just posted :P
<Polydunami> Irish_Pony
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Fair enough
<Ninjazz> Now... hang on, Poly...

<Irish_Pony> :D
<FairysHuff> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uHHmTSDCvA

<Irish_Pony> Polydunami: sorry :(
<Vacation_Wrek> play nice boys
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ninjazz> You guys should kiss and make up. :)

<Mutterguy> bye Vacation_Wrek
<Polydunami> FairysHuff, this is a picture of me. http://imgur.com/XzHYp
<FairysHuff> sub06905: Saved
<sub06905> :3
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: And? I don't get it. Your cute... or would be more so if you shaved.
<Ninjazz> But... the goatee is awesome! D:
<FairysHuff> Ninjazz: Perhaps. But he'd still look cuter clean shaven
<Polydunami> I dunno about getting rid of the facial hair :S
<Polydunami> I'd look like a kid without it :$
<Ninjazz> FairysHuff: To each their own.
<sub06905> Wax it?
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: It grows back. try it. Take a pic and then let us decide
<Ninjazz> Why can't we just let him decide? It's his face, after all.
<Kammerjunk> So I'm a bit slow when it comes to noticing things.
<Kammerjunk> That means I just now noticed that the Pyro had a mask with the text "OPTICAL MASK" on it.
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: But from what I'm imagining in my mind of you minus the facial hair is enough for me to consider you bf worthy material.
<MahBoi777> gnight bronystate, take care everyone:)
<Kammerjunk> In Meet the Pyro, that is.
<FairysHuff> MahBoi777: Night night
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: It's not that big of a deal anyways. :D
<sub06905> night MahBoi777
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: ...Optical mask? Did you see what the Pyro saw?
<Mutterguy> EPIC BOSS BATTLE THEME!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXHsMLqFQC0
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Yes. I did. His "Pyrovision" yes?
<Mutterguy> (16 bit)
<FairysHuff> I think I shocked Polydunami with my calling him cute ^_^ LOL
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: I mean, in Meet the Spy, for example, the Spy was disguised with an unlockable weapon, which was impossible at the time.
<Irish_Pony> Well...I saw a pic of GL brother and....o_o
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Wait... What are you getting at?...
<Polydunami> FairysHuff, I started growing my facial hair last year and I quite like it.
<MadSurge> Mutterguy: wish all videogame music was this good in these days :)
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Nothing, apparently. I just clicked on Day 3, and yes, we get the Pyrovision Goggles.
<Polydunami> I have a pic from before the growing out: http://imgur.com/mlZq0
<Mutterguy> MadSurge reminds me ofFF6 actually
<Ninjazz> Where did the goatee go?! D:
<FairysHuff> Fairy fluff (Fair enough). Thats up to you. Still if you feel like getting together some time let me know ^_~
<sub06905> Polydunami: u look very diffrent
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: I see.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: But seriously, though, an Optical Mask hat would be neat.
<MadSurge> Mutterguy: kinda, huh? FF6 is my fav by the way
<Mutterguy> same
<Polydunami> FairysHuff, http://imgur.com/mlZq0 this is from a year ago.
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Agreed, but I need to play TF2 ALOT more than i do now to care about the hats. :T
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: But think of the rainbow vision, man!
<Ninjazz> o__o I just did.
*Ninjazz needs dat hat
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Hmm... both are good. Though you look thinner in the more recent pic
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: You lose weight or is it just lighting?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: they said the new stuff would spoil the Meet the Pyro video, so we might get the Love Gun and Rainbow Vision :D
<Kammerjunk> One can only hope.
<Polydunami> Well, the collar kind of hides my jawline so it gives the illusion of being bigger :S
<FairysHuff> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uHHmTSDCvA
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Aah. Fairy fluff
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Your in the US aren't you?
<CupcakeWarrior> Polydunami: You got swag
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, my Twilight-themed necklace just arrived today.
<Kammerjunk> It's neat.
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Ninjazz> Congrats! I need to get some maor Rarity swag.

<Kammerjunk> D:
<Irish_Pony> xxMoopyxx: oh hey I live in Fayettvile :P
<CupcakeWarrior> Wait, what country are danish people from?
<rdibp> i feel bad for the pyro :(
<xxMoopyxx> Never herd of that
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: Denmark.
<Kammerjunk> Tiny bunch of islands above Germany.
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh

<xxMoopyxx> Really?
<OneTrickOrange> alright I'm done with starcraft for the night

<Irish_Pony> Mutterguy: o_o
<CupcakeWarrior> Mutterguy: Is it Ninjazz? :D
<Michael> anypony has seen the meet the pyro?
<Mutterguy> shouldn't think so
<xxMoopyxx> Ten million fluttershy's
<Kammerjunk> Michael: If you believe in magic in a young girl's heart.

<killerpony7733> sub06905: awesome :)
<Ninjazz> Mutterguy: Yes.
<xxMoopyxx> I don't have a inbox
<Mutterguy> CRAZY!
<CupcakeWarrior> And what does nano mean?
<rdibp> Meet the Medic has 11.6 million views and 80,000+ likes, Meet the Pyro has 1.9 million views and 100,000+ likes :O
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: A billionth.
<Ninjazz> it's a dream I have. >.>
<Kammerjunk> Very small.
*CupcakeWarrior would rather do physics
*rdibp would rather stop time
<Kammerjunk> I support nanotechnology with all my heart.
<Mutterguy> i think it realstes to solar cell collecting. I think he's using zirconium semi conductors...
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: So do i
<xxMoopyxx> Hey guys member this in the naked gun movie 8=====>
<Kammerjunk> I want my goddamn contact lenses with HUD already.
<rdibp> :O
<Kammerjunk> xxMoopyxx: Why can't I hold all these puns?
<xxMoopyxx> hahahahahahahahahha
<xmasskills1> :0(
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: I wanna make the excuse of running into people and saying ''forgive my interruption my vision is augmented''
<rdibp> xmasskills1: sad clown is sad
<FairysHuff> I just ordered two MLP shirts.
<xxMoopyxx> Hey can i tell everypony something real quick?
<FairysHuff> http://www.redbubble.com/people/northerndash/works/8083175-science?utm_campaign=order&utm_medium=email&utm_source=RB
<Kammerjunk> Other than nanotechnology, I want stem cell research to hurry up already.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Oh, awesome.
<FairysHuff> http://www.redbubble.com/people/zendric/works/7719821-flutter-rage?utm_campaign=order&utm_medium=email&utm_source=RB
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats nanotechnology? :S
<Mutterguy> Kammerjunk i want new lungs :(
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: What Tom have you been living under?
<xmasskills1> CupcakeWarrior: dont play coi you know what it is
<rdibp> nanotechnology? He's not here, is she?
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: Nanotechnology is the study of manipulating stuff on an atomic and molecular scale.
<MadSurge> FairysHuff: I love Flutterrage :D
<CupcakeWarrior> I havent been paying attention to scientific advances for some reason
<FairysHuff> CupcakeWarrior: Nanotech is when they shirnk kittens down to the size of cells and inject them in mice
<rdibp> MadSurge: :[
<rdibp> <3
<valoreins> nanotech clothes, i've heard of it
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: Fair enough. It -is- a relativel recent development.
<Kammerjunk> valoreins: So have I. Do want.
<xxMoopyxx> I have been doing cock push up its were you have to lay down flat on the grounf and then you let your boner lift you up off the ground
<FairysHuff> MadSurge: I love them both ^_^
<MadSurge> rdibp: I'd love her anyway :D
<rdibp> i would rather prefer flutterbitch
<sub06905> xxMoopyxx: dat Tenacious D
<Kammerjunk> valoreins: Are you talking about the jacket with holes that open and close?
<xxMoopyxx> hahahahahahahaha
<CupcakeWarrior> Wait, whats the point of that?
<xxMoopyxx> nope
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: The holes open when it detects sweat, allowing in air.
<xxMoopyxx> you know whos the voice of that?
<CupcakeWarrior> Awesome :O
<valoreins> more like a normal clothes using a nanotech that if it spilled with water, the water wont ruin your clothes and it kept dry
<xxMoopyxx> the voice of that was Jet Black
<Kammerjunk> Also, guys, people are working on a gun which can quite literally heal you.
<CupcakeWarrior> Medigun
<Polydunami> I'm getting sleepy
<CupcakeWarrior> ?
<Kammerjunk> Quite.
<valoreins> healing gun lol
<Mutterguy> my problem is... a rarity tie if it was just the coat colour + the cutie mark would mean you'd have to wear non white shirts and that means blazers that aren't black... unless you have some sort of mne and coat coloured pattern
<xxMoopyxx> Boner 8===========D
<valoreins> I'm a sniper +medic
<Polydunami> ... yep. I'm outta here. Goodnight everypony!
<Kammerjunk> Mutterguy: What about a white jacket and Rarity-mane-colour tie?
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Polydunami! Take care. :)
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Night night
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Polydunami.
<Mutterguy> Kammerjunk that's probably fine
<CupcakeWarrior> Im reminded of the mlp panties that were in an EQD post xD
<Polydunami> I'll try
<valoreins> oh bai Polydunami
<sub06905> still believe they should make oants with cutiemarks on them

<CupcakeWarrior> Ikr
<CupcakeWarrior> Night Polydunami
<FairysHuff> Polydunami: Does want mlp panties
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, guys: Magnets. They cure depression.
<xxMoopyxx> Lets just hope that HASBRO doesn't get to mad about htat

<Kammerjunk> sub06905: That's another thing. I haven't seen any MLP pants yet.

<Alchemist> and Im back. Hello everyone :)
<sub06905> WB Alchemist
<Alchemist> passed the exam, got a C, which is good considering that out of 18 people 10 failed :)
<Polydunami> ... CupcakeWarrior, I hope that doesn't come with the mannequin xD
<xxMoopyxx> Ghost says: "Get me out of here egineer ha ha ha ha whoooo!
<OneTrickPony> imma go to sleep now see ya guys tommorrow
<Polydunami> Wait, why am I still here?
<Kammerjunk> Alchemist: Resaluta, et gratulatio!
<Alchemist> thank you :)
<Kammerjunk> Or "Macte virtute!" Whichever.
<FairysHuff> Now that I've shared those great shirts with you all. I shall now go play more x-com. Cause I can.
<Alchemist> now, I have to endure 8 more hours befor I go to sleep. Been up for 30
<Alchemist> FairysHuff: enemy unkown or tftd?
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: I'm playing all of them at the same time. Dipping in and out. Including Apocalypse
<Alchemist> Cool :9 I didnt like apocalypse that much though.
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: How come?
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of apocalypse, am I the only one who really, really wants to play Wasteland 2?
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk: yes
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: It's by the guys who did Fallout 1 and 2.
<Alchemist> I dunno. I guess the new interface and the faction system didnt do it for me. And the base level soldiers were more inaccurate then the ones in tftd...
<CupcakeWarrior> Wasteland 2? Ive never even heard of the first one :P
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: Fairy fluff.
<Rainfall_Night> is nothing streaming or is my computer that bad
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/D-gfjyqPQLw
<FairysHuff> Nothing is streaming
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: A bunch of people have. Let me put it like this: The official site for it says "Your mind just exploded like a blood sausage."
<CupcakeWarrior> Sounds awesome :D
<Alchemist> I remember that one of them emptied a full mag on a facehugger (the little yellow blob thingie) point blank and didnt hit once.
<Kammerjunk> That's almost Duke Nukem Forever level of self-worth.
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: I've never had that problem.
<Alchemist> Oh, if you are familiar with Arma 2: DayZ and saw the Walking Dead series, this will be hilarious: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1145-xJIsg
<MadSurge> Alchemist: Stormtrooper aim at its best :D
<FairysHuff> Alchemist: That is funny. Even without the references
<Alchemist> if you can research heavy plasma and flying suit, you are pretty much sorted even without psy powers.
<FairysHuff> I was going to play x-com... but I'm getting drowsy now. Think I'll just nap.
<FairysHuff> Laters.
<Alchemist> bye :)
<Rainfall_Night> we are the cutie mark crusaders, on a quest to find out who we are, and we will never stop the journey, not until we have you cutie marks!
<Alchemist> Oh forgot that this is the dead time period of the chat
<Alchemist> that means I can run around naked :D
<CupcakeWarrior> Ehh, no thanks
<Alchemist> damn, I though noone was watching
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, I'm rewatching Meet the Pyro again and again.
<Kammerjunk> If you believe in magic, come along with me. We'll dance until morning, just you and me.
<CupcakeWarrior> I believe in ponies :D
<Alchemist> is the flamewar still raging?
<Alchemist> Im already listening to the 10 hour version of fukkireta, I think I'll be good for a while.
<Rainfall_Night1> it said my nick name was already in use
*CupcakeWarrior is bored
<Spell-of-Gaming> UGGGGGGHHHHHH
<CupcakeWarrior> Hi Spell-of-Gaming
*Ninjazz kicks a tumbleweed across chat
<Ninjazz> Hey, Spell-of-Gaming.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I hate myself.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I COMPLETELY FORGOT MY BOOK TO DO MY ASSIGNMENT
<Spell-of-Gaming> I CAN'T RESEARCH THE INTERNET
<Spell-of-Gaming> AAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH
<Kammerjunk> What's there to research? It's just a series of tubes.
<CupcakeWarrior> Hi Airpuff
<Kammerjunk> So I'm still rewatching Meet the Pyro, now with subtitles by VALVe. And the Scout says "He's not here, is she?"
<Kammerjunk> My belief that VALVe consits purely of trolls is strengthened.
<XAX> Lol.
*XAX still hasn't watched it.
<sub06905> well im off, night everypony :$
<junh1024-XD> oi Glacymr i'm seeing a PURINSESU CHUCHU trailer? on one of the DVDs i'm renting
<Kammerjunk> XAX: Son, I am disappoint.
<Rainfall_Night1> who is using rainfall_night
<XAX> Kammerjunk: I have like... 500mb of broadband left, lol. I'm avoiding YouTube.
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<XAX> Curse this country, and it's crappy broadband.
<junh1024-XD> some nutcracker? in the trailer
<Rainfall_Night> who knows when the next stream will be
<Rainfall_Night> i love waking up early
<Rainfall_Night> the sun is not all up in my face
<Kammerjunk> I love waking up early and then drifting in and out of sleep for the next few hours.
<Rainfall_Night> i go to bed at 8 and wake up at 4 :)
<oni_link> Hmm... I need an help with a PC gaming brony here
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: I'm not omniscient, but I'll try.
<oni_link> Krammerjunk: well do you know your stuff when it comes to building a desktop?
<Kammerjunk> Physical desktop?
<Kammerjunk> As in where you place your PC? Or your computer's desktop?
<Rainfall_Night> you know whats bull krap
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: man I am just failing tonight... but yes :)
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: I'm not sure what you mean with "building" it.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, you mean a desktop computer.
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, I'm a bit slow.
<Invi> moin everypony
<Rainfall_Night> when you go to a website to download something and end up clicking on a ad that says download, theyre everywhere
<Kammerjunk> Salve, Invi.
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Invi. :)
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: I have some experience in the matter.
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: I need a second opinion for what will actually go in it lol
*Invi salhoofs Kammerjunk
<Chrysalis> heya
<XAX> Hi Invi.
<Ninjazz> hey there, Chrysalis. :)
<Chrysalis> how are people today?
<Rainfall_Night> ive seemed to have missplaced my headphones
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: Do you have anything in mind?
<Ninjazz> Tired.
<Rainfall_Night> brb
*Invi huggles Ninjazz XAX and waves to Chrysalis
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: I am that I am.
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: Well I don't know if I should go with AMD in terms of a processor or just play it safe with Intel
<Chrysalis> awesome
<Chrysalis> what did people think of Meet The Pyro
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: Well, I have an AMD from a year back. I haven't had any problems with it yet. I don't really think I've used an Intel for a long time, really.
<oni_link> ahhh darn you flash!!!!!
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Flash crashes. You are so random.
<Ninjazz> XAX: The body is ready.
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: :D So what do you think? I could easily go with a 6 core on AMD but I don't know if it's worth it. I can always just get a quad core on Intel
<Rainfall_Night> f
<Chrysalis> anything after 4 is a waste atm
<Mutterguy> hoorah!!
<Chrysalis> hell, most games etc are still built for dual
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: I agree with Chrysalis that you don't need any more than X4, and right now, I have an AMD which I got a year back. I haven't had any problems with it so far. I don't even think I've used intel for a very long time.
<Chrysalis> oooh lightning
<Chrysalis> i still got my core-2 quad in my machine
<Chrysalis> a bigger graphics card is better than a bigger cpu
<oni_link> Well Chrysalis and Kammerjunk, that may be true right now but wouldn't you think it would be a wise investment?
<oni_link> Chrysalis: darn a moment too late lol
<Rainfall_Night> lol http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arH3od_2xIg
<Chrysalis> Rainfall_Night man that vid
<Chrysalis> it keeps getting revived
<Rainfall_Night> :D
<Rainfall_Night> i have 6 chickens
<Malavolent> It loops!
<Chrysalis> you guys seen PyroLand ingame yetr?
<Rainfall_Night> 1 is named scootaloo
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: Honestly, I'm not sure. As I said, I haven't used an Intel CPU for a long time. I have an AMD Phenom II (X4), it works for me. As Chrysalis, a better graphics card is more important.
<Kammerjunk> As Chrysalis said*
<Chrysalis> in all fairness even a 2 year old card works fine
<Chrysalis> just turn down the settings
<oni_link> I had an X4 black edition, it was pretty good.. Maybe I should just stick with AMD?
<Invi> this Iris chat seems to have the need to getting used to.
<Rainfall_Night> Rainfall_Night
<Rainfall_Night> i love that beep
<Kammerjunk> Beep boop, son.
<Kammerjunk> Beep boop.
<Rainfall_Night> beep boop
<trollhunter> hia all
<Chrysalis> For most users there is no difference between intel and amd, except intel are more expensive
<oni_link> hey trollhunter
<Ninjazz> Hello there, trollhunter.
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: I'd say so, yeah. I'm hopefully getting a new CPU soon, but I don't know what the newest products are at the moment.
<Chrysalis> theres a new tech from intel
<Chrysalis> which is quite good
<Chrysalis> amd havnt done anything meaningful in a while
<trollhunter> no stream or dos my internet suck
<Rainfall_Night> anyone up for some hay fries
<Chrysalis> no stream
<oni_link> Chrysalis: yeah and with the difference, i can go all out with the graphics card. I really want to stick with ATI, are you familiar with their products to help me out with that too?
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: Not surprised, really. No doubt I'm being influenced by my inherent need to not choose the leading brand.
<oni_link> Rainfall_Night: sounds good, count me in!
<Rainfall_Night> they should sell those at fast food
<Rainfall_Night> youd proboly get sick though
<oni_link> Rainfall_Night: :D im still willing to try it
<Rainfall_Night> yay
<Alchemist> btw, a new nova rage video is up :)
<trollhunter> nova rage ?
<oni_link> so WHEN did meet the pyro come out??? Somepony said it was out
<Alchemist> uberhaxornova
<killerpony7733> oni_link: yesterday
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk usually the leading brand is leading for a reason
<oni_link> :O
<Chrysalis> intel chips are BETTER than amd
<Chrysalis> its just most people wont see that
<Chrysalis> but as for GPU
<Chrysalis> i always run ATI, so iv not had much to compare in terms of
<Alchemist> trollhunter: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv4B7avZn5Q
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Well I'm willing to hear your input. What and why should i consider Intel?
<Chrysalis> but i belive the ATI ones are more powerful, while nVidia tend to make ones which last a bit longer
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: I know, I know. It's the same reason I don't buy popular brand clothes or have an iPhone.
<rdibp> HOLY CRAP!!! ITS THURSDAY!?!?!
<Chrysalis> oni_link, intel ones are far easier to overclock and maintain stability at far higher freqeucnies
<Kammerjunk> orly
<Chrysalis> also, their ivy bridge should add some really nice performance
<Chrysalis> and the latest tech lets you boost cache performance if you have an SSD in the primary sata
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Ivy Bridge... I forgot that was out too. Man, I feel like ive been living in a cave
<Mutterguy> I'll be back in an 1 hour and 20 minutes for a semi relevelnt video (only relevent in NZ but meh...yay time zone!)
<Kammerjunk> I have never overclocked my processor, actually.
<oni_link> also, I'm finally gonna get an ssd. :) Any brand do better than the others?
*rdibp is eating a klondike bar :)
<XAX> Mine was at 3.7ghz when I got it
<XAX> No need to overclock: really.
<oni_link> XAX: What chipset are you using??
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, I never got that down completely either. What advantages does SSD have over HDD?
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk raw speed
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: Faster reading rates I believe
*rdibp is being ignorred :(
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<Chrysalis> SSDs are incredibly fast for read/write
<Chrysalis> and much better in terms of random read/write
*oni_link pats rdibp on the head
<Chrysalis> which hdds can struggle with
<rdibp> :)
*rdibp purs
<Rainfall_Night> anyone have any video that i can watch
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Don't they have a longer life span too?
*oni_link gasps at the purring
<oni_link> :D
<Rodney> typing with an ipad in bed while teamviewing your pc is hard
<Kammerjunk> Well, I just got a 2 TB harddisk 2-3 months ago, and I need a new one soon.
<Chrysalis> if its for primary storage, go for HDD
<XAX> oni_link: Intel I5 2500K
<Rodney> kammerjunk: wtf did you do with that space lol
<Chrysalis> much better cost per gigabyte
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: :O
<Chrysalis> but for OS/Games then SSD gives a better performance
<Kammerjunk> Oh no, I'll be moving all my pirated games and media to my file server, then I'll format everything.
<Kammerjunk> Rodney: What didn't I use it for? Games, films, mods, more books than I should have.
<Rodney> books?
<oni_link> Chrysalis: One thing I can give Apple is their peripherals. I plan on buying a Time Capsule cause I need it for Storage and to replace my old router
<Kammerjunk> I still don't have enough books, though.
<Rodney> a book is,t that big i think
<Chrysalis> ew apple
<Chrysalis> the single worst brand ever made
<Chrysalis> over priced, under featured
<Rodney> forgive my typos, typing on ipad
<Kammerjunk> Rodney: Meh. I think I have around 1500. Not taking the most space, but I keep adding.
<oni_link> Chrysalis: well I am not an isheep. you can lower your guard :D
<Chrysalis> not really guard
<Chrysalis> i just pity anyone who fell for the shiny case
<Chrysalis> and wasted so muhc of their money
<Kammerjunk> Getting an Android was the best decision of my life.
<Rainfall_Night> dont you hate the part on the star wars blue-rays when vader says noooo as he throughs the emperor over the railing
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Only thing i want is their Storage solution. And in terms of Phone os, IM ALL ANDROID
<Rainfall_Night> unessesarry change
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: /)
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: (\
<Chrysalis> so the time capsule is just a NAS with wifi
<killerpony7733> /) /) /) /) for everypony! :D
<Rainfall_Night> (\
<oni_link> Chrysalis: I am willing to get something else if its cheaper. Good god, if there is tell me!
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, Chrysalis, what do you make of a certain harddisk manufacturer stating that they'll have a 1.2 petabyte harddisk out in 2-4 years?
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk that seems fine
<oni_link> killerpony: (\ better late than never :D
<Chrysalis> when we move to hologrpahic storage and blu-ray dies
<Chrysalis> we can see 1-2tb on an optical disk
<Rainfall_Night> rember tha part in naked gun 33 1/3 when hes driving through everything even
<Chrysalis> so hd sizes like that seem reasonable
<Kammerjunk> I'd say that with a petabyte, I'll never need to buy a disk again, but I've already made that mistake.
<Chrysalis> also, 1min of googling, and an equivelant to the time capsule, including wifi, and extra features such as phone and windows support
<Chrysalis> LESS than half the price
<Kammerjunk> Pardon, time capsule?
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Apple-stuff.
<Chrysalis> £250 for the apple version, £120 for a western digital version
<Kammerjunk> Well, what'd you expect from Apple?
<Chrysalis> over priced, under featured, and so much locking its unusable for anyone who has a preference
<Chrysalis> but oni_link was saying he was after an alternative
<Chrysalis> just look for a NAS
<Chrysalis> (Network Attatched Storage)
<Chrysalis> apple do a damn good job of making their users blind to the phrases everyone else uses so they can't get away
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Well Thanks :) this is what happens when your brother you talk and work with everyday is an iSheep :D
<Kammerjunk> Meh. Microsoft did some dumb things too.
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl_QZMroHxc&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=4
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk as have linux
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, I hate Apple as much as the next bloke.
<Chrysalis> no OS is a single solution
<oni_link> I actually plan on going with Ubuntu as a dual boot with Win7
<Chrysalis> hell, my main machine runs both windows and linux, and my remote servers are all linux based

<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, not sure what the union is called but the networked storage is called a nas
<Phase4> 00,02allso steam servers are going very slow
<Chrysalis> i wonder why

<oni_link> Phase4: yes, thanks! I also cant wait to see you play those games too
<MadSurge> Nice, LA Noire!

<MadSurge> BEEP
<MadSurge> Pinkie <3
<Phase4> 00,02this game seems to be centered around teritory control
<trollhunter> is this dj alex
<Kammerjunk> I'm more a Twilight kind of guy, but Pinkie is definitely my second most favourite pony.
<Kammerjunk> trollhunter: Yes.
<Rainfall_Night> dat pinkie pie
<MadSurge> Pyro being replaced by Pinkie makes so much more sense now :D
<Ninjazz> Wait... This is... What was it called again?
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: She's mine too.
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: I can't honestly choose
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: it's okay, you still like her :)
<Rainfall_Night> cupcakes
<Kammerjunk> I like everypony!
<Kammerjunk> Except Blueblood.
<MadSurge> ^
<Rainfall_Night> i hate blueblood
<Rainfall_Night> so rude
<MadSurge> And Diamond Tiara :D
<Kandarihu> What game is this?
<Ninjazz> ^
<Kammerjunk> Trixie wants to be famous, Gilda wants her friend back, Blueblood is just a brat.
*Ninjazz coughs Trixie's name
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: i can agree with that. Maybe Diamond Tiara and Angel.
<Ninjazz> >.>
<killerpony7733> Dat spraying
<Rainfall_Night> +Phase4 dont die
<Ninjazz> But Angel was so sweet in the other episodes. :(
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not sure what i'm doing
<oni_link> Ninjazz: I dont like what he became
<Rainfall_Night> buffer
<Phase4> 00,02too mug lag
<MysteryPony> Hi everypony!
<Phase4> 00,02319ms ping
<Kammerjunk> Salve, MysteryPony!
<MadSurge> Trixie is not THAT annoying, she just has an ego too much big for her own good
<Ninjazz> oni_link: He's such a sweet heart in Hurricane Fluttershy, though.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<oni_link> Phase4: srsly dafuq?
*MysteryPony hugs Kammerjunk!
<oni_link> about dat ping that is
<Kammerjunk> Aye. As I said, Trixie wants to be famous, Gilda wants her friend back, Blueblood is just spoiled.
<Phase4> 00,02i would like to see another trixie ep
<Rainfall_Night> :|
<Kammerjunk> As would I, but I know it to be unlikely.
<trollhunter> what up MysteryPony
<MadSurge> DED
<MysteryPony> trollhunter: nothing spesial! just woke up!
*Ninjazz gives a late wave to MysteryPony
<oni_link> Ninjazz: If he redeems himself, I'll change my opinion of him
*MysteryPony hugs Ninjazz! and trollhunter!
<Rainfall_Night> shes a pony
<Ninjazz> oni_link: How has he not? He's Flutter's contrast. Plus... how can you be so mean to such a cute wittle bunny? What would Flutters think? :(
<Ninjazz> Dat VIP remix
<oni_link> Ninjazz: dont... dont give me that face :( but I did like him at first but now its like meh.
<Rainfall_Night> who is that
<MadSurge> For one thing, Angel isn't your stereotypical fearful and timid bunny rabbit
<Ninjazz> ^
<oni_link> MadSurge: I will give him that, yes.
<MadSurge> Brb lunch
<oni_link> lol
<oni_link> k
<Ninjazz> oni_link: I'll just say that there are FAR worse things to hate. :(
<Rainfall_Night> its lunch for you
<Rainfall_Night> i used to be up all night and asleep through the day
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, have you guys heard of HAL 5?
<Rainfall_Night> i hated it
<oni_link> Ninjazz: hate is not what im feeling. hate a strong word, Id say im just not too fond of Angel now.
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: nope
<MysteryPony> the interwebs has spoken! we need more pinki in this chat!
<Ninjazz> oni_link: Ah. Understood.
<Ninjazz> Even then, he's still was too sweet not to like. :(
<oni_link> Ninjazz: was. :P
<Ninjazz> Episode 22 in season 2.
<Kammerjunk> http://derpy.me/VRKph - Meet Hybrid Assertive Limb 5, or HAL 5. It's an "artificial powered exoskeleton". It allows the user to carry 5 times the weight they normally could.
<Ninjazz> it was pretty recent.
<Kammerjunk> Basically, it turns you into Iron Man.
<MysteryPony> Kammerjunk: but does it blend?
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Is that real?!
<Chrysalis> huh, i thought i still had this installed
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: Yup. It's called HAL. And it's made by Cyberdyne.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: I can see it becoming wide spread within heavy lifting jobs etc
<Kammerjunk> I wish I was kidding there.
<MysteryPony> killerpony7733: or in boxing!
<trollhunter> if that sute is real thats fucking awesome
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk: Ho-ly crap. The things we're doing...
<killerpony7733> MysteryPony: That is a silly use for it tbh
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: The question on everyponys mind is Will it run Crysis??
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: It can run Chrysis THRICE.
<Kammerjunk> But no, you don't get to shoot lasers out of your hands.
<Kandarihu> I see, so this game is called Nuclear Dawn
<oni_link> :D and i am impressed. Iron Man might actually happen within my lifetime :D
<trollhunter> money is the best super power
<oni_link> trollhunter: i see what you did there
<MysteryPony> Kammerjunk: okay you use that suit i want this one!!! http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/12/kristof_e2_440.jpg
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: Oh yeah, and a bunch of eggheads want to make telekinesis.
<Rainfall_Night> THIS IS REALLY COOOL http://www.bronystate.net/theater/rainbow-dash/
<Kandarihu> trollhunter: I agree, though it's more of a regular power.
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: really now??
<oni_link> Rainfall_Night: haha you dont say??
<Kammerjunk> oni_link: It's called the Brain-Gate Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems. Or BGNIS.
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, I mean Brain-Gate Neural Interface System.
<Phase4> 00,02i'm terribly confused
<oni_link> Kammerjunk: I will add that to my notes and keep my eye on it
<Phase4> 00,02tf2 does this to you
<Chrysalis> mmm tf2
<MysteryPony> hmmm cake!
<oni_link> Phase4: well I dont blame you, at least you were stuck on something good :D
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everypony! :)
<MysteryPony> RaveBrony: good morning!
<oni_link> hello RaveBrony!
*MysteryPony hugs RaveBrony !
<trollhunter> hey bravepony
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02this lacks the polish of tf2
<trollhunter> aahh I meant RaveBrony
<oni_link> Phase4: its not as easy on the eyes imo.
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<MysteryPony> Phase4: lol nothing can rly compear to the polish og tf2!
<Phase4> 00,02nothings colour coded
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue who's shooting me
<Phase4> 00,02or where i'm going
<oni_link> Phase4: how is it for gameplay?
<Kandarihu> Well, this isn't really about the graphics. This is a hybrid genre game.
<RaveBrony> Nuuuuu, time to go sees muh doctor. Bbs!
<Vordox> Phase4: Just like in real life, now how about that.
<oni_link> RaveBrony: i hope you do!
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02internet died
<Phase4> 00,02anyway, Kandarihu: i'm not arguing the 'quality' of its graphics
<oni_link> Phase4: so it doesnt look as good but does it play alright??
<Phase4> 00,02i'm arguing its design
<Phase4> 00,02everything is about the same colour
<Phase4> 00,02and its too dark
<Kandarihu> Point taken.
<Phase4> 00,02i was navigating with the map and blue arrow things
<Phase4> 00,02over the heads of team mates
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, guns are guns
<Phase4> 00,02they work like in any source game
<Phase4> 00,02the rts part is rts, not that familar with rts and havent played commander yet
<Ninjazz> ALL THE BLUE TEXT!
<Ninjazz> I LOVE IT!
<Ninjazz> MUHAHAHA!
*Phase4 00,02hugs Ninjazz
*Ninjazz hugs Phase4 back
<oni_link> Phase4: so thats what it was a hybrid of?
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02if you heard that guy, he was the commander
<Rainfall_Night> when i was really little i thought that if i put a egg under my pillow a dinosaur would hatch
<oni_link> ah now i know thanks for that
<Phase4> 00,02he's dropping turrets and suply stations for the troops
<Phase4> 00,02who's goal is to gain teritory and resources for the commander
<Phase4> 00,02so they can destroy the enemy's base
<oni_link> Pretty cool concept. sounds like a battlefield 2.2 lol
<Saturn> 08,01urgh
<Saturn> 08,01my god
<Saturn> 08,01i should stop eating spicy food
<killerpony7733> Phase4: any idea what to play now?
<Chrysalis> Saturn why?
<Saturn> 08,01the bowels cannae take it, captain
<Chrysalis> ah
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, nope
<oni_link> Saturn: Spicy food is best food :D
<killerpony7733> Phase4: not too bored of L4D2?
<trollhunter> wow +Phase4 you have a shit load of games
<Saturn> 08,01my lower intestine is currently on fire because i ate a bowl of chilli nachos last night
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: oh don't get me wrong, i love spicy food
<Phase4> 00,02magicka demo it is
<Kandarihu> Magicka!
<Chrysalis> Saturn wow you are WEAK to spice
<Saturn> 08,01i grew up in an indian household
<Phase4> 00,02trollhunter, that i do
<oni_link> Saturn: You're getting me hungry
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: just my gut
<Phase4> 00,02most of them are from the humble bundle's
<oni_link> haha
<koen> 4hi
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: honestly, in last night's nachos, i didn't even taste the chilli
<Cypresswolf> I can't deal with much spice either - I get the worst acid reflux
<koen> 4where is lighty?
<Kandarihu> When I eat spicy food, the only thing I burn is my tongue.
<Saturn> 08,01everyone else had to leave it because it was too hot for them
<oni_link> Saturn: it just doesnt agree with you im guessing?
*Ninjazz knows he has heard this song before
<Ninjazz> Fate?...
<Kandarihu> Uh oh
<Ninjazz> Phase4: White screen.
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: maybe i have some kind of ulcer or infection in my lower inestinal tract
<Kandarihu> Here we go
<Cypresswolf> anything above buffalo medium is too much for me
<Ninjazz> Nope. magicka.
<Saturn> 08,01maybe my gut is just over sensitive
<Saturn> 08,01i have no idea
<Kandarihu> We won't be able to read the text like this.
<Ninjazz> DAMMUT, PHASE! Why you play when I don't have access to my computer! D:
<trollhunter> I just got the humble bundle and I was going to play it but then some one of my friend gave me dark souls
<MysteryPony> has everypony seen MEET THE PYRO????
<Saturn> 08,01did you know that the intestines have the largest amount of neurons in the body outside of the brain?
<Kandarihu> MysteryPony: yup. We were playing last night too.
<oni_link> Saturn: maybe you should get that looked at especially since you like spicy foods. and i didnt
<MysteryPony> Kandarihu: isnt it awsome???
<Kandarihu> Yeah
<Phase4> 00,02stupid nvidia
<Phase4> 00,02its optimus thing is cool and usefull
<Phase4> 00,02but broken in implimentation
<Rainfall_Night> how do you get desktop ponies to work, it just says you have no ponies installed
<Cypresswolf> :) I learned there was an experience cap in Fable TLC - fighitng undead with physical shield on to prevent the combat multiplier from decreasing everytime I got hit - stops at 999,999 if you don't spend that XP
<Cypresswolf> stopped around 315 CM
<Kandarihu> Rainfall_Night I t should come with the stock set of ponies.
<Phase4> 00,02trying the demo
<oni_link> Cypresswolf: oh man thats the best one of the trilogy imo and i didnt know that either
<MadSurge> :O Magika?
<Kandarihu> What? The text is scaling? Awesome!
<oni_link> bananar
<Cypresswolf> Beat Bargate Prison - my favorite part of the game until you get to the Norther Wastes - just to fight the Kraken & unlimited zombies
<MadSurge> This game is awesome to play with trolling buddies :D
<Kandarihu> This game is full of pop culture references
<MadSurge> ^
<oni_link> This is relevant to my interests
<Kandarihu> I got a bit of buffering so I tried refreshing. Big mistake.
<oni_link> Kandarihu: yeah im stuck with the dotted spiratl still
<oni_link> *spiral
<Kandarihu> Is anyone getting the video?
<ofna01> Hi
<ofna01> Nah
<Cypresswolf> 2 game I miss playing are the Bard's Tale & Gauntlet Legends for Playstation - sold those games years ago - must have barely been in highschool
<MadSurge> Phase4, stream died
<Kandarihu> Phase4: we're not seeing this. Mips.tv is having problems
<ofna01> stream is ded
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02flash media live encoder is fucked up
<Phase4> 00,02how do you code things this badlyt
<Phase4> 00,02badly'
<Phase4> 00,02i meen srsly
<Phase4> 00,02this is more than neglect
<Kandarihu> Yeah, they messed up a lot in the beginning.
<oni_link> no me gusta
<Cypresswolf> :D Bard's Tale even had musical numbers at certain parts of the storyline - It's Bad Luck to be You is one of my favorites, a trio of goblins come of out nowhere and sing a new verse the further you progress in the game - multiple endings to missions and the end of the game depending on what you choose to do
<Phase4> 00,02and then everything broke
<Kandarihu> http://www.magickapedia.net/wiki/Mea_Culpa_DLC
<Phase4> 00,02so yeah
<Phase4> 00,02things are broken
<MadSurge> Fun fact: in italian, the eponymousness of cowardice is the bunny, not the chicken, which instead is used as a synonimous for "sucker"
<ofna01> has anyone streamed Meet The Pyro yet?
<ofna01> ....
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, you there?

<Ninjazz> Mr. Mumbles is best kitty. :3

<MadSurge> Or maybe Marie, after Marie Curie :D
