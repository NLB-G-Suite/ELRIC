<RucaKnex> <3 rose
<NOU> stoopid macine
<Bruce_Lai> wow, look att his, its so much better than most of the cartoons
<pony64> jack is too god for these robouts
<P0N-3> Dubstep is great when used in moderation.
<MasterSonic10> Is this a movie or a TV Show?
<Kandarihu> I honestly don't think there is any music genre I truely hate to the point where I avoid every instance of it, no matter how good it might be or what it's fused with.
<Bruce_Lai> Tartakovsky should stick to cartoons...
<CCharmanderK> Hi, Kandarihu!
<marauder_shields> tv show
<Jyxia> a Tv show
<Life_Essence> My Chaos Lord does that
<KrazyNoobs> Some people prefer rhythm and beat, and others prefer music. I don't see why there has to be an argument between the two.
<MasterSonic10> k thz guys
<marauder_shields> called samurai jack
<pony64> only genre i dont liek to much is country
<BigMatt390> PAWNCH
<BigMatt390> KICK!
<BigMatt390> TV Show. Samurai Jack
<MasterSonic10> thz*
<NOU> This hands Adventurre time's ass SO HARD BROOO
<reineir_crypt> tv show
<PonyGaiden> its samurai jack...you never heard about it?
<MasterSonic10> thx*
<NOU> IT WINS HARDDD
<BackgroundPony> PinkiePayne, wubs are NOT a core part of Dubstep.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> want a hug Rose` ?
<P0N-3> I don't like dubstep if the entire song is wubs and drops.
<Barbetos> more coffeeeee
<Temm> jack shouldnt use a shield! :P
<pony64> i feel stupid
<P0N-3> That's like seasoning pepper with pepper.
<pony_painter_360> rose i give 101% suport
<CCharmanderK> I Barbetos
<TopHatt> spartan buckler and a katana = ultimate combo
<CCharmanderK> *Hi
<Dark_Horst> btw, what did i miss?
<pony64> your fort save
<Kapo> i forgot how bad ass samurai jack is
<pony64> and you die
<September> My god you guys, first CoD then Dubstep?
<NOU> Spartan Buckler and Katana.
<Wrek> 05this show is 40% visuals, 55% sound and abience assents and 5% dialogue
<Kandarihu> The closest might be country music. And if not for Bastion, I'd probably say that Country music is the only form of music I entirely dislike.
<Java> Listening some people here declaring their hate to dubstep reminds me back in the 90s when old people hating techno.
<Bruce_Lai> i just love dexter's lab, samurai jack and the powerpuff girls
<NOU> GLUB.
<Wrek> 05ambience*
<AC4> Thhose robots are pretty dumb
<MasterSonic10> Because I'm so happy, i'm going to give everyone a hug!

<SailorFuzz> 100 moons (lunar phases) translates into just about 8 years (8.082), and since we know that Twilight met the Apple Family at their last reunion (AJ confirms this in Applebuck Season) and this is the next reunion, we can conclude that 8 years has passed in Equestria.

<valoreins> derpy possessed spike
<Gold_Demona> When Spike became Derpy
<oni_link> spike has Stockholm syndrome, hes used to doing his kidnapper's (twilight's) bidding
<Phase4> Kammerjunk, good point
<RaveBrony> Dragon Code?
<RaveBrony> Interesting
<MadSurge> :D
<Bjornfot> He does things for Twilight all the time... what's the difference?
<AttackWithHugs> Phase4: because Twilight would have his head if he messed up her precious books
<Ponies47> Gold_Demona, Because Hasbro made him that way just for this episode most likely :O

<RaveBrony> But it wasnt bad
<RaveBrony> *7/10
<naturesfury> i found it to be ok
<Eli> dude Bronysith can you stop hating on everything for once?
<Eli> Bronysith: what are you even doing here?
<Bronysith> Eli: all i fuckign said was 4/10
<Phase4> Eli, i find most of them obvious, but obvious != bad for me
<Bronysith> jesus christ Eli stop beign so critical
<Solid_Sparkle> 3/10 would not buck
<Phase4> how it happens > what happens
<pony_1630> >brohoof is now canon
<MadSurge> Wasn't that eventful, but certainly wasn't bad.
<oni_link> ^
<DJEasyGryphon> XD
<pony_1630> >inflation is now canon
<AimlessPone> and explode*
<pony_i> feels a little like fan pandering, all these old call backs

<Michael> fanfics are canonno
<TheAussieBrony> Dat CGI
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Pebbles are OP
<MadSurge> ^
<wowviewer> Uh.....
<Misty_Rain2> It was prtty good.
<NullRadix> Spoilers: The status quo will be maintained
<Eli> Bronysith: lol.. me being critcal... yep why not

<Phase4> 00,02i'd like to point out that you guys spammed so much that you knocked the kickbot offline
<AttackWithHugs> Bye Gold_Demona
<Acronym> at least pinkie was awesome
<Red_Scout> MURDER IS CANON
<Omega_Weapon> oh well, I'm done
<Alex_K> AJ write clop is canon
<pony_3023> 5/10 is average
<RICHARDTHELIONHEART> ARCHERS USE FIRE!!!
<RaveBrony> I loved the Rarity bits of the ep :3
<StrawHat> Fuck yea little's pet shop
<pony_3117> TODAY'S HERO: TOM
<Mistshadow> oh look next petshop episode is blythe-has-a-crush
<DocSane> It wasn't crappy. It was just a very bog standard kid's show story.
<RucaKnex> hahah
<Omega_Weapon> good bye everypony
<P0N3> Don't you guys know how golems work? The timberwolf falling apart makes sense.
<Gilda> Hey, I'm Gilda, you're SUPPOSED to hate me.
<pony_3503> the hub is bronies
<RICHARDTHELIONHEART> aye aye!!
<Phase4> 00,02gj guys
<wowviewer> I'm still thinking which is worst, but there's a high chance this is probably it :S
<GameTaco> This is Applejack's real favorite song.
<APPAJAK> ha! spammers win
<Braviary2> Really? No kickbot?
<Cosmic> Hahahahahahahahahahaha
<pony64> there was almost 3k people here
<Bongoro> Lmao phase4
<DaringDerpy> yay
<Lyra833> They're kind of running out of ideas, IMO.
<Page_Turner> 9/10 forget you haters.
<DitzyDerpy15> yeah
<XL-Zero> i wish for a big dragon spike
<DJPsychOH> 5/10 is best rating
<pony64> dam
<DitzyDerpy15> lol
<valoreins|Resting> maybe the group of timberwolves that the mane casts encounter are the "underdogs" of the wolf group?
<TheFactSphere> Hooray, a new achievement.
<AC4> so true
<AlienWarhead> no
<DashingArmor> timberwolves > sombra
<NBBrony> I loved sombre!
<Kotano> Phase4: Achievement unlocked!
<pony_5878> sombra < timberwolves
<DocSane> Which, I guess, makes it a weak FiM episode.
<K> PET SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
<Obsidian> damn you spammers
<DitzyDerpy15> so..
<Misty_Rain2> Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that... hmm..... welll..... yuh..... The noble Dragon Code.
<Ponies47> I felt sorry for Rarity :<
<RucaKnex> yeah episode 5/10
<Cosmic> Timberwolves > Sombra
<Eli> Bronysith: i just speak my mind when someone gets on my nerves. and i really haven't seen you EVER say anything nice. can't you at least try? you're so bitter dude
<Sundaysmile> Sombra sucked
<buddy> ok
<pony64> yea he did
<Braviary2> GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK GAK I CAN'T GET AUTOKICKED GAK GAK GAK GAK
<wowviewer> It's worse than Sombra
<FlankFlank> Timberwolves are still cooler than sombra.
<P0N3> Timberwolves. Are. GOlems.
<texasboykc09> Phase4, not supriced
<joker4383> THAT EPISODE WAS LIKE, FOR KIDS
<DitzyDerpy15> im gonna sleep again
<pony_3023> I like Sombra
<Vuld> Eh.
<SpikeLulz12> we just spammed the hell
<Tri333> so timberwolves are fragile but don't die easily
<StinkomanFan> SOMBRERO
<KrazyNoobs> gak
<pony64> SLAVES
<oni_link> RaveBrony: I think you like all bits of Rarity in every ep XD
<TheAussieBrony> yup
<ponyJack> he was from the orange county
<silentPony> CRYSTALS!
<Simon> Timberwolf is bad
<Vuld> timberwolves still rock.
<xuincherguixe> Nah. Timber Wolves had more lines.
<GameTaco> Speaking of Celestia, hi Zoe.
<pony_i> timberwolves get woodworms and drag themselves on the floor
<Sir_Hoofalot> timerwolves are still better than Sombrero
<wowviewer> Timberwolves got defeated.... by a rock
<Firelight> If you can Kick it's ass with a rock, then it shouldn't even be alive.
<Bronysith> Eli: im not being bitter, im a critic
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: her mannerisms are awesome :3
<Sundaysmile> At least the timberwolves were consistant
<BlitzWing00> Nothing wrong with Timber Wolves, just AJ was killing them.
<pony_4882> I thought sombra was awesome
<Kandarihu> Well, I think the giant timberwolf coming together like that pretty much covers under the rule of robots in animation. "Anything artificial is expendible, even if it's also sentient."
<sonicdude558> Zoey/Twilight Barkle
<pony_insertnumberher> Season finale against Giant timberwolf Sombra hybrid
<Bronysith> Eli: teh show lacks consistency, thats all
<TheAussieBrony> g2g, bye guys
<RICHARDTHELIONHEART> REGULAR SHOW REFERENCE EVERYWHERE
<pony64> Sombre shouldve saved spike
<Red_Scout> *yay*
<APPAJAK> Timberwolves: Still a better villan than Sombra
<DitzyDerpy15> Twilight hair on dog yeah
<Sorca> Want more SOMBRA
<XL-Zero> I WANT EPIC TRANSFORMATION OF LITTLE SPIKE TO A BIG ONE
<applejack`> woah
<duster> woot the shit
<pony_6315> ahhhhhh the commerials have the worst timing...........
<twiluna> i like sombra. timberwolves are still cool too
<DashingArmor> door >
<richfiles> Spike used "Rock of Destiny". It was super effective :D
<applejack`> ...
<DarkStar> Rock you like a hurricane!
<DerpyDinkyCombo> episode was better then last ep
<Eli> Bronysith: why are you watching then???
<RaveBrony> oni_link: But of course!! :D
<KrazyNoobs> My kick was dubs. 2777
<xuincherguixe> Didn't Sombra also get beat by a rock when you get right down to it?
<AlienWarhead> and the stairs
<DerpyDinkyCombo> 6/10
<Phase4> 00,02Door is best villan
<TBi> da door
<joker4383> I LIKED THAT HE WAS A GIANT AND SCARY MONSTER, BUT DEFEATED BY A CHOKE? SERIOUSLY. 8/10
<Bongoro> The real villain here is exercise
<duster> lol
<Salaim> Well sombra's grow-level and the timber wolves lines were practically equal...
<catsik> dildo
<ImaginaryBoxes> Wheels are a better villian than sombra
<SpikeDragon> Sombra.
<DarkChaos17010> the door knows everything
<ponyJack> Celestia needs to learn not to banish villains in things
<kidzrul732> hi twilight
<Bronysith> Eli: cause it is still enjoyable
<duster> tit
<Bongoro> Stairs, stairs, and more stairs
<Page_Turner> theyre just animals guise...
<applejack`> ??/10 ?
<P0N3> Equestria Radio guys! Timberwolves are golems. It make sense.
<RaveBrony> MadSurge: Indubitably :3
<applejack`> awwww
<pony_insertnumberher> EVERYONE DIES TO ROCKS
<DitzyDerpy15> Phase4 is best villain :3
<matttheshadowman> I liked the episode, more than Wonderbolt Acadamy it's one that I think will grow on people although that Dragon did come out of nowhere a bit... 8/10
<DocSane> Do people forget that you can drive off timberwolves with a loud noise?
<gameleon> WORST PART IS: no episode till January 19
<ponyJack> they tend to come back after a thousand years
<Treydog98> Stairs is best villain
<kidzrul732> I LIKE CHEETOS!
<slickaflicka> dog twighlight
<APPAJAK> Wheels >.> you can't trust them
<Eli> Bronysith: -.(\
<pony_4882> Just cause he didn't do much in the episode doesn't make him a bad villain in my book
<Sparklerific> inb4 villan reformation
<pony_3117> hmm.....8/10
<Dr_Fumbles> FUCK WEEABOOS!
<NBBrony> well. He can at least create traps/puzzles.. poor Sombra.. No loves..
<sonicdude558> Kingdumb Hearts
<RaveBrony> Wait.....wait....
<Ragmo> what about wheels?
<alexxm> why didn't spike set it on fire
<DaringDerpy> http://derpy.me/WZNmG
<K> TWILIGHT DOG
<xuincherguixe> That is a pretty nasty way to die.
<Sorca> OP uncontable door
<Firelight> Racist.
<oni_link> RaveBrony: I like her too :P PInkie master race for me though
<Phase4> 00,02DitzyDerpy15, : D

<AusPony> racist
<pony_9289> You guys suck.
<RucaKnex> spike servant
<SpikeDragon> SPIKE IS SERVANT.
<Galaran> Twilight
<oni_link> *Pinkie
<DocSane> They're scary-looking, but not terribly hard to defeat.
<TheFactSphere> DOORS, STAIRS, WHAT NEXT? WALLS? WINDOWS? WE MAY NEVER KNOW.
<joker4383> TWILIGHT MANE?
<RaveBrony> There was plot rubbing.... and Twi hugging.... and Bronysith didnt like it?
<hayfries> spike craves the BSDM lifestyle
<Matdat> No episode till 19th Jan? :o
<SoarinYoshi64> WHAT?!?! worst episode?!?!?! EXPECTED MORE from the timerwolves?!! The Timberworlves are just a side story to help with the main idea from the episode, don't expect every episode to have one good, and one bad, the main idea was that Spike had to stick together with Twilight rather than others- the Timberwolves didn't even need anything else! D:< (whoever read this, thanks for listening)
*Bronysith takes Ponies47 to bed
<Sparklerific> Twilight knew the code
<DitzyDerpy15> NP :3
<Welsh_Pony> RD is a fanfic writer
<pony_9289> You guys suck.
<silentPony> Salve is a slave, and has always been a slave.
<DarkChaos17010> spike shouldve killed it with fire
<maphy> SPIKE IS A HOUSE ELF
<RaveBrony> Spy checking is GO!
<duster> applejack wrote to sun butt last episode
<KrazyNoobs> Spike was just a fag in this episode. I'm sorry, he was just proven to be a tool. I liked Spike before.
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: no i liked it
<pony_3117> BRACE YOURSELF. FANFICS INCOMING
<Tervicz> Spike is a samurai!
<APPAJAK> Spapplejack fanfics...
<pony_3645> Let's see a new episode?
<blast> I liked the colored design of the timberwolves really, they looked eviler somehow
<wowviewer> I think it isn't being a slave. I think as to he just wants to help out... all out in the wrong way :S
<diyonysus> it's twi as an animated dog
<pony64> oficially: racist barn; AJ is racist . . and rarity wants slaves
<Phase4> 00,02some were finished before the episode was aired because iTunes leaked again :<
<APPAJAK> here we go
<pony_9289> You guys suck.
<pony_4882> Timberwolves are lower lvl enemies
<RaveBrony> Oh, ok, lol
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: but thats just fanservice T~T
<flutter_spin> Applejack should have said "Be Twilight's slave" and he would have obliged
<Sundaysmile> RD is a fanfic writer
<Red_Scout> lol
<Jealous-Rarity> dash's fics are good quality.
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Spike is just a beta, guys. An incredible beta, but yeah.
<Ichijoe> needs a stream of LPS w/o comentary
<pony64> horray mlp
<APPAJAK> silly iTunes
<DitzyDerpy15> oh nooo

<pony_3645> <3 :p
<joker4383> bye

<Celestia> Gak has more dialogues then sombra radio guys
<_xXiaoDrag0n_> GOTTA GO FAST SONIC X!

<NBBrony> Hmm. Rarity gives Spike a sock?
<ImaginaryBoxes> EXACTLY
<VenHur> The episode to most of us...Weeell, it's not the most strongest episode, sure the CGI Timberwolves were a nice touch, buuuut... [sigh] Meriweather, I am disapoint.

<Tom> Episode 11 of season 3 "Keep Calm and Flutter On" airs in 20 days, 23 hours, 25 minutes, 43 seconds (Jan 19 15:30:00 2013 UTC)
<Bronysith> i mean spike rubbing applejacks flank like that and then he has sexy times with Twilight?
<Eli> Bronysith: couldn't you have stoped at "i liked it"=
<MasterSonic10> Who said "GOTTA GO FAST"???
<Jigglysaint> it looks like that one comment about the white ponies being racist are actually true
<Bronysith> so awesome
<Eli> ?
<Cheezman75> Wasn't the worst of S3, but still can't be any higher than a 4/10.
<gameleon> One thing that bothered me was... why was spike suddenly so clumsy?
<DitzyDerpy15> euro movie night...
<pony_3645> I <3 :|
<SunnyP> The last fight was lame but great episode
<DarkChaos17010> spike shouldve just used his fire breath to kill it
<TheFactSphere> @Kazur OF COURSE. WE MUST PREPARE FOR THE WHEELS, WHO SHALL TAKE THEIR REVENGE.
<AttackWithHugs> 20 DAYS?
<Ichijoe> 1080p 5.1 sound?
<K> PEEEEEEEEEEEEET SHAP
<richfiles> I watched it on itunes, then a few minutes later, watched it here, with everypony! :)
<AttackWithHugs> WHAAAAT
<DitzyDerpy15> lolololol
<Sparklerific> the back scratch scene felt wierd
<Phase4> 00,02SpeccyRush, your colour is imposible to read XD
<DarkStar> This is the first time I watched it with people, over the internet. :P
<Djibouti> we also witnessed murder in today's episode. murder is canon
<APPAJAK> racist barn. racist barn
<GameTaco> hesnotmyboyfriend
<joker4383> The episode could be an excelent one, but the climax screwed thing up
<NullRadix> panic!
<Rappafoin> SoarinYoshi64: I saw it and read all of it
<RaveBrony> O_O
<K> guys
<PuebloDoG> I'd say Sombra still needed more lines to at least make a better charater
<slickaflicka> one episode he slapped a pony's ass and shoved his face up twighlights ass
<APPAJAK> one two three four
<K> guys
<texasboykc09> Phase4, ikr
<DJPsychOH> OR you can download if off of YouTube
<Bronysith> jesus
<FBlue> This is honestly my least favorite this season so far.
<EasyQuest> Itunes versoin are messed up, the audio for the latest as messed up
<CerealBox> as long as spike doesn't tell stories of simple truths to applebloom before she gets hit by a bull, I'm good
<Red_Scout> cheerilees garden

<Ichijoe> def not 1080p
<K> wanna know what secret it is
*Ponies47 flips table
<wowviewer> Not necessarily. If you looked earlier, they regenerate, so murder was not involved
<noname> nope
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> I AM TIMBERGOD, OH GOD A ROCK *DIES*
<Tervicz> I guess timberwolves are just extremely fragile things
<DarkStar> Same
<Stephane> lacking substance

<TBi> TIMBERWOLVES ARE BEST MEGAZORD
<AppleCrisp> Applejack and acootaloo!

<Stemglass> Applebloom is always best Pony.
<kristelsouthpark1> lol
<oni_link> the biggest stretch Ill go to is anthros. Ill admit to that
<penguin> love me
<AppleCrisp> s
<Gilda> Here's a question for you lot. If Timberwolves can not only regenerate, but also rebuild themselves using any available wood, wouldn't that make them more like Wood Elementals?
<xuincherguixe> Spike dumped his int stat. That's why he didn't set them on fire.
<moo> starbucks is best coffie
<duster> this episode is derp
<pony_6315> houston blend
<TopHatt> TIM HORTONS
<VenHur> The episode was "Meh" to me...I don't know why...I just don't had the words to describe it.

<AppleCrisp> Everypony is best pony!
<moo> food is best food bro
<hayfries> Which of you would be Rarity's servant for a week?
<Tervicz> ACME termites could do away with timberwolves I suppose
<pony_i> nah, it was meh to me also. Little interesting happened. a few good jokes stopped it being bad. But nothing made it great or even good
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: Hehe.... My best friend came out of the closet in the middle of a road trip with his family, 6 states away from home... So i quickly learned to deal with it :D
<Sparklerific> LPS is killing the inteligence of S#
<Bronysith> cause pansexual is best sexual
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Parrot has teeth...why
<Sparklerific> s3
<Brony_1337> Nopony is worst pony.
<duster> no
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: serves you right
<xuincherguixe> I think Wood Elementals makes more sense than Golems. They seem to have personalities.

<Pwigy> fluttershy is best pony
<Azuredragon> http://derpy.me/nOFPB
<PuebloDoG> In your opinion, what are your favorite magical (non-pony) creatures in MLP?
<crazitaco> LPS is glorious, sparklerific
<Gilda> You would think a Timberwolf to be much more dangerous, but as these fellows already pointed out, they are terribly fragile.
<Cabrony> Sunil is best pet,i ship him with pepper clark
<Simon> SuperBrony64: Because Hasbro
<duster> nice

<ImaginaryBoxes> Scoot-Scootaloo: How much Dub could a Dubstep step if a DUbstep could step dub?
<CerealBox> MUFASA
<VenHur> But I can say one thing about it, the computer generated Timberwolves, and the humor. With special honor going to Pinkie Pie, because...She's Pinkie Pie.
<RaveBrony> and then I got a gf, and I wouldnt get any if I made gay remarks
<AppleCrisp> Cya all till next Episode, And good bye Sexy voices!

<Cosmic> I'm not straight~ :3
<Technical> "Kinda straight" Lmao
<xuincherguixe> Guy in Realy Life
<Pwigy> in no dimension is there a pony that is dead or alive that is better pony than fluttershy
<Sparklerific> no, not vengence... LOVE AND TOLERATE!!!
<moo> :D
<Acronym> pinkie pie was awesome
<Phase4> 00,02Azuredragon, still a better antagonist than.... whoever was the antagonist in the twilight series
<pony_3645> Who is the worst pony?
<duster> sexy tie?
<TopHatt> ITS SICK
<Wrek> 05back
<Cosmic> Heya, Wrek!
<Brony_1337> Nopony is worst pony. :)
<Phase4> 00,02i'm terribly confused about the story of those books
<xuincherguixe> To be fair, I'm pretty sure that real life doesn't exist.
<Stemglass> is there a worst pony?
<RaveBrony> Im glad I dont mind it now, looking back I was a monster o_e
<Gilda> I got another question. Why would Celestia force Twilight to read? It seems trivial.
<moo> twist is best pony imo
<kristelsouthpark1> how does that big head fit in that bag?
<richfiles> Reminded me of Family guy CGI sequences! :D
<crazitaco> i love zoey's bark. its so cute sounding <3
<Stemglass> I'd give my opinion, but I'd get flack for it :p
<duster> imma ghost like me
<Azuredragon> Zoid timberwolves
<Phase4> 00,02xuincherguixe, what is this real life?
<alexxm> Scoot-Scootaloo undertaker or kane
<Technical> 3Dimensional objects cannot exist in a 2Diminsional reality.
<DarkStar> Who are you guys?
<Sparklerific> the Ponysher
<Phase4> 00,02is it a new video game?
<PuebloDoG> In your opinion, what are your favorite (non-pony) creatures in MLP?
<DocSane> Gilda: She assigned her 12 books to read in one weekend.
<oni_link> I dont really care about people being gay, some really cool people I've met are gay
<Dark_Horst> they probably used cgi becasue it would've been a pain in the ass to do all these timberwolf parts in flash
<dat> Who is the worst pony?
<CerealBox> so is it zap apple jam season again?
<Phase4> 00,02they look like machinery
<ImaginaryBoxes> Scoot-Scootaloo: How much dub could a dubstep step if a dubstep could step dub?
<Kammerjunk> I have a hard time being upset about people's preferences.
<Dark_Horst> if they had used flash for so many movable objects, they would've needed a shiot ton of layers
<duster> timberwolfs
<Barbetos> Phase4 RL is the worst dungeon.
<RaveBrony> Although I have to say....
<EPIC_luna> <3 will you PLZ say im Batman <3
<Pwigy> :3
<Sparklerific> zapplejapple
<Kammerjunk> But then again, I have a hard time taking anything seriously. Especially stuff that matters.
<VenHur> I think the computer generated Timberwolves were there to blend in an sort of Disney/Futurama feel to the show.
<Red_Scout> steps= 55
<Pwigy> urmahgurd
<DarkStar> I find it sad that I'm only now noticing their really thin legs...
<moo> IM BATMAN
<Sparklerific> lol, no

<penguin> so how is spike a noble dragon, when he can't even fit in with normal dragons
<ImaginaryBoxes> and....an ad.
<oni_link> cant take em seriously
<pony_4652> trixie is amazing!

<PuebloDoG> What are your favorite (non-pony) creatures in MLP?
<Bronysith> Since when did Regulars turn into SST?
<EPIC_luna> yay thx moo
<Technical> A random stranger
<Gilda> I once heard a theory that Rainbow Dash's mother was heavily abusing Zap Apple Jam while she was pregnant with her. What are your thoughts on this, chat, commontaters?
<xuincherguixe> What's the worst idea for a fanfiction you can think of?
<Technical> It would be a stranger
<Uboa-San> If baby applejack didnt exist, What would you do?
<Pwigy> iv got big balls
<RaveBrony> SST?
<Simon> Which pony would you choose to live with and why?\
<AC4> After this episode, is applejack still a background pony for you?
<Stemglass> One BAd Apple = Best episode
<Technical> No one you know.
<RaveBrony> Oh, nvm...
<Bronysith> nothing
<matttheshadowman> also why didn't Pinkie do the roar it would of been a good call back to Dragonshy
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Saigneur> PuebloDoG: not spike
<ImaginaryBoxes> Scoot-Scootaloo: CAN YOU raise this barn?
<Bronysith> mmmmm
<Bronysith> sexy ponies
<VenHur> Maybe the producers are striving to put CGI elements in the show for thier curiousity. And it COULD be used in later episodes for the better, but I am only saying.
<Red_Scout> omg:|
<DarkStar> When did you guys become bronies?
<sleepy_pony> who is best none pony from mlp?
<APPAJAK> you should sing Racist Barn

<Fluttershyz> Bronystate if you had the chance to fuck fluttershy would u? 0.0
<crazitaco> it seems like yall are far more critical than i am. i enjoyed that song so much
<Jageman> Phase4: ya, the disney logo was in the comersial

<StinkomanFan> Where do we go to ask questions?
<Pwigy> because the other kind are newfags
<Jageman> commercial
<wowviewer> lol
<BlitzWing00> The Dragon Code was a bad premise
<Higgs> THAT'S A SENSITIVE SUBJECT, GUYS.
<sonicdude558> Pirates 9001
<Brony_1337> He's trying to fit in with his kind by doing what they do, I guess
<Stemglass> Crackle is best Pony
<Phase4> 00,02crackle is best pony
<Shootaloo> crackle is a noble dragon
<CerealBox> spike is very much a reluctant dragon
<Technical> He said it was His own code
<Phase4> 00,02damnit Stemglass!
<Technical> Not something to relate to the others
<richfiles> Maybe Noble dragon code is a thing that dragons who live among PONIES have adopted.
<Stemglass> :3
<moo> moo
<Pwigy> good share it with humans then
<dat> PLEASE!!!!!
<duster> would you play hack and slash game starring timberwolf?
<crazitaco> indeed, crackle is very noble.
<richfiles> Maybe it's something he learned in canterlot???
<Phase4> 00,02i've got far to many people in my steam friends
<Yaram> scoot-scootaloo: can you nrab tsicar?
<CerealBox> wait, what happened to spike's pheonix?
<korey123> I got Gak for christmas.
<penguin> Scoot-Scootaloo: so you will share your phone number but not your steam?
<crazitaco> lucky you, korey! :D
<duster> are you cool
<Stemglass> Steam is srs business
<pony_5644> Did I miss the episode, or is it playing right now?
<DocSane> I'm pretty sure the noble dragon code was something that Spike read about and that no other dragon follows.
<BlitzWing00> It would have been ok if it was some code Spike made up for himself, but Twilight said the Dragon Code is important at the end, WTF?!
<hayfries> why do timerwolves need to breathe
<moo> lol
<Sumica> 00,10CerealBox, they left it in the basement

<penguin> maybe celestia took peewee in
<DocSane> To be fair, most of the pets disappear.
<dat> Can I potato you?
<crazitaco> woop woop :D
<VenHur> You guys, Spike is different from his kind because he is a humble timid baby dragon, He knows that the dragons apart from him are selfish to him, and that greed cosumes him like if it is an corruption, sort of like in an Dark Magic door sort of way.
*Ponies47 huggles SuperBrony64 tightly "your such a silly pony" :3
