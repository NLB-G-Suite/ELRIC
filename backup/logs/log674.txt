<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FWSkiBvDPM&feature=relmfu
<RAWRity> Path_Forger: I don't think you get what "cyber-crime" entails
*LunasGuard sees nurse redheart for teatment
<Kimori> this ones similar but it has different ones
<HoodyNinja> Spell-of-Gaming: Put all the internets onto 10 different giant nodes on the planet
<Path_Forger> RAWRity: probably not :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's the phillipines.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not the US.
<RAWRity> "Cyber-crime" most often deals with 2 things: kiddie porn and identity theft
<Path_Forger> oh those
<HoodyNinja> And piracy
<Ryunosuke> hacking also falls under cybercrime
<Ryunosuke> piracy is the iffy issue
<Path_Forger> HoodyNinja: that was what i was thinking
<RAWRity> occasionally copyright infringement shows up, but most often the issue is people doing super nasty, illegal stuff on the internet.
<HoodyNinja> I have no idea what pirates have to do with internet crimes
<Buytoast> CYBER CHASE
<Buytoast> WE'RE BEATIN HACKER AT HIS GAME
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I see someone other than me remembers that
<Lunar_Brony> HoodyNinja The Pirate Bay is a torrent site
<AJIsAwesome> I do.......
<Path_Forger> ugh torrents
<AJIsAwesome> It was a great show.
<Spell-of-Gaming> BTW, Anonymous Philippines hacked a webpage on the first day of the anti-Cybercrime law. :P
<HoodyNinja> Lunar_Brony: :\
<Ryunosuke> personally I do not think piracy is cybercrime because of past technology advancements and laws regarding such
<LunasGuard> Buytoast: was just thinking of a joke with them
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast I LOVE that show! The old episodes, though. I'm not a fan of the new animation style
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay chat, gather round. I'm going to be doing a bit of an experiment this stream
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<RAWRity> Ryunosuke: that was one of the most superfluos, pointless statements I've ever seen.

<HoodyNinja> I can still win
<Meanwhile> Exactly like the lottery.
<Phase4> 00,02SaxyPretender, shhhhh, don't tell them
<Buytoast> at least at this rate
<pony_802082> ValtheJean: well on the other hand i think he desrves it since he actually knows these songs instead of googling
<flutterchu> what are you playing? fluttercry
<HoodyNinja> pony_802082: shhh
<pony_802082> huh, my name is wrong
<RAWRity> anon> Assuming everyone else is googling and nobody else knows the songs
<pony_802082> oh well, ill stay anon

<Lyra`> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8d1wrnMUS1qmu108o3_1280.png
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is always good to know i have no musical culture
<Polydunami> I remember watching a video based on this musical in social studies :P
<pony_802082> RAWRity: he knows them best it would seem.
<RAWRity> No, he's just hitting enter before everyone else.
*Zuxxez123 listening to ValtheJean's awesome taste in music while practicing drawing OC. :3
<pony_802082> RAWRity: no, he actually recognizes them immediately
<Polydunami> You don't get +m anyway, fluttercry
<RAWRity> that's literally all this contest comes down to: who has the fastest connection/reactiong coordination
<HoodyNinja> damn googles not working
<pony_802082> not really, its jsut who has the fastest fingers
<RAWRity> and LadyCanary gets it

<cachi01> ValtheJean: lol
<Meanwhile> Agreed. That made me laugh.
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, it's not even that. It's more of a matter of whose correct entry shows up first from ValtheJean's PoV.
<LadyCanary> ^_^
<fluttercry> 05,15So close...Nice job LadyCanary
<Wirisme> aw so if I gave a troll answer I could've got points? :(

<Reikim> Wut.
<fluttercry> 05,15craaap....I it's on the tip of my tongue
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SaxyPretender /)
<Kandarihu> By the way, I am sufficiently warned. If I ever admit to muting something I don't like... well, I've been warned.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 one of my favorite songs from this musical :P
<HoodyNinja> If Val is trying to get me to listen to more "cultured" music, it's not working
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this happens to be my father's favorite musical
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but not because of the music :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim val is doing some kind of contest "guess the song/musical"
<fluttercry> 05,15Wait...now I know it
<RDash5000> AJIsAwesome: everytime i get on here, you're on too. i love you for that.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 HoodyNinja...so glad to see you think so little of me
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> Is he playing anything?
<Reikim> right now?
<RDash5000> no homo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 cause obviously it couldn't be just wanting to do something fun for you all -_-
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<HoodyNinja> ValtheJean: Aw, wanna hug?
<Reikim> I guess my stream is dead.
<HoodyNinja> I'm sorry, I'm just a douche
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well is workin for me so far
<J_E_Smith71> Well even if I'm not going to win thanks for this medley of show tunes Val
<pony_802082> ValtheJean: so little of you? on the contrary, i think thats would be good
<pony_802082> more of this kind of music on stream i mena
<HoodyNinja> I had to go and continue a joke that was told 10 minutes ago
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> change from otanet already
<Meanwhile> Nah, play more dubstep.
<Cypresswolf> All of these are great songs - makes me want to raid my Gramma's stash of musicals - she has a 50+ year collection on vhs stored in her garage :) Think I'll visit her this weekend
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: cultured? We had a song called "If You Were Gay" earlier
<LadyCanary> ^
<AJIsAwesome> RDash5000: Thanks. :$
<cachi01> RAWRity: culture ftw?
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: Pop culture?
<DerpyMuffins> Hmm, Im reading a fanfic with a refernce to Caramel
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity an awesome song*

<Yahooz> AH CHESS
*LadyCanary nestles in fluttercry's mane :3

<Yahooz> OF COURSE
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> can we get one from sweeney todd ? at least i would get one right without google
<RAWRity> this isn't about Culture. It's about music
<Buytoast> so pretty much at this stage it's just a contest between canary and fluttercry
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: JOKES! Not for serious people.
<RAWRity> Buytoast: I think I can still win this
<Buytoast> what are the scores now? 24 and 24 vs 6 and such?
<Kandarihu> Well, I've been warned. I've been overwarned. How long should I be honorbanned from here for?
<HoodyNinja> I have 1
<HoodyNinja> 1!
<HoodyNinja> And yet I couldn't ask for more
<LadyCanary> Hm...

<LadyCanary> The harmonies in this are lovely.
<RDash5000> HARMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONY
<fluttercry> 05,15I.....barely recognize this one :(
<HoodyNinja> this music scares me
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone want to take bets on who wins?
<AJIsAwesome> I'm loving this. Gives me more music to listen to. :)
<LadyCanary> Hmm...
<DerpyMuffins> I bet my single Allegr0 dollar fluttercry wins
<LadyCanary> Never heard this.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this one should be good, because I think our traditional winners wont get it right :P

<Meanwhile> I hate this Gaaaaaaaame
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i like the music

<Reikim> Meanwhile's just annoyed because he can't possibly win at this.
<LadyCanary> I swear to Celestia if I dont get this first.
<RaveBrony> I dare not try to guess before the others tho.
<J_E_Smith71> Heh its fun seeing Gummy serve to a song with a beat like this

<Reikim> OH WELL. Might as well enjoy the tunes anyway~
<pony_802082> RDash5000: yep
<Wirisme> I might be
<Dester> Reikim the feeling is mutual

<HoodyNinja> OH I have NO IDEA what this could be
<SaxyPretender> 0,14RDash5000, no non-image links during stream
<DerpyMuffins> LadyCanary beating you fluttercry
<RDash5000> SaxyPretender: roger
<LadyCanary> .3.
<fluttercry> 05,15She's tied!
<Meanwhile> You should start unmuting it randomly. It'd make this competition so much fiercer.
<fluttercry> 05,15But I'll change that!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 tehnically she's 4 behind
<DerpyMuffins> Tied means no one wins
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but if she gets this she's tied
<J_E_Smith71> RDash5000: Only dari bot can do EqD links during stream
<RaveBrony> Damn, and i just Had to misplace that Dari pic :D
<RAWRity> again, fuck this musical
<RAWRity> fuck it in the face
<Polydunami> Hm?
<DerpyMuffins> Well there goes my Allegr0 dollar

<Polydunami> I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE +M
<J_E_Smith71> Does that really count since the answer was given away?

<weeping_pegasi82> phantom of the opera
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, just keep an eye on the channel when the song gets *close* to ending
<Polydunami> Well, here we go again.
<superretroworld> are we only choosing classical songs?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i wonder if saying skrillex - scary monsters and nice sprites would get me kicked
<HoodyNinja> I just spam up enter
<Meanwhile> How're we supposed to know when it's close to ending.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the theme for today is musicals
<Meanwhile> One cannot live on the key alone.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 other days it will be different themes
<Reikim> Oh no wait. Okay, confused because this has the same tune as one of the psalms we used to sing in mass.
<weeping_pegasi82> angel of music?
<fluttercry> 05,15The Bass Clarinet part to this suuuuuuuucked
<Reikim> It would get a frowny face.
<Meanwhile> weeping_pegasi82: If you're guessing, you're in the wrong channel.
<fluttercry> 05,15Guesses go to #Vinyl_Scratch
<weeping_pegasi82> just making sure.

<HoodyNinja> You gave me that answer :p
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, nerf_soldier! :)
<Reikim> It's Phantom but I don't know the song.
<Meanwhile> Because Rei you briefly swapped your brain with a boiled potato.
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<RAWRity> Reikim: because it comes from a wholly unmemorable, overrated musical?
<Polydunami> Good night, nerf_soldier
<Polydunami> Right?
*HoodyNinja glomps nerf_soldier
<Yahooz> im just not even guessing anymore... there were two of these that, had it not been for +m, i would have in the bag...

<HoodyNinja> RIGGED!
<Meanwhile> You have to lose!
<Buytoast> it's not going to work out in anyone's favor other than canary and fluttercry anyways
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I want it to be close :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Yup, this one rocks
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not an overwhelming domination
<Kencolt> How does gummy do that for so long and not get dizzy?
<LadyCanary> Oh my.
<superretroworld> why are you guys copying the same song on vinyl scratch?
<Buytoast> it's been an overwhelming domination for a while though
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kencolt, it's Gummy
<Reikim> This sounds familiar...
<J_E_Smith71> superretroworld: Because it's the game of course
<Reikim> ...Oh my god. Nostalgia filters just kicked into full gear.
<LadyCanary> O_O
<RAWRity> damn do I love this song.
<DerpyMuffins> Talk about a combo breaker

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> since i don't know nothing about those song i'm just putting random names right now
<Polydunami> Hey, Kinixys
<Reikim> Man I love this song.
<Kinixys> wha?

<CrimsonPhoenix> dammit will why are you so deep
<HoodyNinja> Yay!

<LadyCanary> OH MY GOD

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> seriously ?
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Try up entering yourself, might get a point
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> like seriously ?
<Meanwhile> HoodyNinja: Shaddup.
<pony_802082> Polydunami: actually makes it harder because you cant up+enter spam
<J_E_Smith71> Dang it
<CrimsonPhoenix> ValtheJean, I wonder if you got any french musical stuff
<Cypresswolf|zzz> This is in a musical? I learned something new today :)
<fluttercry> 05,15I can't help but snap to all of this musical
<DerpyMuffins> It sounds like a hippie wrote this
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I doubt it, unless you count Les Mis as French (which it doesn't really count)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i wonder if val have something i know without google
<CrimsonPhoenix> I was thinking of something from Don Juan
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yeah I really doubted you had any
<Reikim> Trying to search this gets the Fergie song.
<Reikim> Dammit.
<SirGanjalf> DerpyMuffins: It sounds like something from the 50's - before hippies
<J_E_Smith71> ValtheJean: If this test is a success and think up of some rewards, do you think you'll make this a weekly planned thing instead of doing it at random?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 most definitely
<DerpyMuffins> Before hippies?
<DerpyMuffins> Hmm
<SirGanjalf> eeyup
<flutterchu> i heard this before.....*clap* *clap*

<HoodyNinja> Hmmm
<DerpyMuffins> This sounds like a Disney song
<Meanwhile> There's literally no point.
<Reikim> Sounds vaguely familiar
<fluttercry> 05,15Reikim I most certainly am not
<AJIsAwesome> I just add the music to my playlist because I love this.
<Buytoast> why do you think i keep entering joke answers?
<fluttercry> 05,15I just have NOOOOO life
<Reikim> Yes you certainly are.
<Buytoast> there's been no hope for a while now
<Reikim> Clearly you have some kind of weird music database plugged into your brain.
<Reikim> And that's in turn plugged into IRC.
<DerpyMuffins> This has a hint of Disney for some reason
<fluttercry> 05,15I haven't seen this one yet, but I REALLLLLY want to
<Buytoast> oh well
<LadyCanary> I'D BETTER GET THIS

<pony_802082> fluttercry: you need to make a tactical loss here..
<fluttercry> 05,15But....winning
<Reikim> I claim FC is using a script.

<Dark_Horst> a cookie?
<HoodyNinja> Phase4: One point ;_;
<J_E_Smith71> Hey ValtheJean if this becomes a regular thing, will there be a set time how long this goes? We've been going at this for about two hours now. I mean it's a lot of fun but will there be a set time it ends?
<RAWRity> Buytoast: technically you have less than nothing
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast should be winning
<Phase4> 00,02and then fluttercry won
<Sumica> 00,10wait you owe IQ points?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there will be a set time, yes. As I've said many times before, this is just an experiment
<Phase4> 00,02HoodyNinja, you'll need to get one more then

<Phase4> 00,02mario_pony|, connection troubles?
<p4ngya> what the heck is going on in the chatroom :D

<J_E_Smith71> Forgottencrow: PM song suggestions
<HoodyNinja> I never shoot for best, but at least the top 3
<Forgottencrow> ok sorry
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 I'm Canadian. You didn't use the proper phrasing to put "eh" on the end of your sentence. You didn't even bother to put a question mark on for buck's sake! I will type out an essay in PM telling you how to properly use "eh?" if necessary.
<Sumica> 00,10awwwwww i was enjoying that
<p4ngya> is there a stream up or no
<Cades> That's pretty cheap
<Lunar_Brony> Incase you can't tell, I get pretty pissed off when "eh?" is misproperly used
<mario_pony|> RaveBrony: Yes?
<RaveBrony> :o
<Kencolt> p4ngya: tHERE'S A GAME.
*Phase4 00,02hugs Lunar_Brony

<mario_pony|> RaveBrony: Oh well I don't talk much
<RaveBrony> :P
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica that is how you spell "Canada".
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: I guessed
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and RAWRity takes the point
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld :D
<Buytoast> but he said flash gordon
<RAWRity> woo!

<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, it is rigged against people who make joke guesses
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: where would the honor be if I LET you win? Wouldn't it be better if you beat me while I'm trying by hardest?
<scout19_tf2> well cya everypony got homework to do:)
<Lunar_Brony> Sure, they only show movies that are a month old, but it sure as hell is fun to go to.

<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohai SuperBrony64
*RAWRity has never been to a drive in
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: You are older and therefore know more about the more classic pieces that Val is playing, and while it could be considered cheating since I am using google, I didn't have the advantage of witnessing these things first hand
<Kandarihu> ValtheJean, what about people who complain about songs?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 think of it this way
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: get better
<RAWRity> beat me
<Lunar_Brony> RAWRity you will never truly watch a movie until you watch it at a drive-in

<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: Bah! I'm having a mid-lfie crisis!
<Zuxxez123> :P
<HoodyNinja> Zuxxez123: Get a degree as a ditch-digger
<Zuxxez123> Done!
<Polydunami> Well, Drew Carey can no longer make use of that great gravitational pull :P
<HoodyNinja> Your not in your midlife yet
<Kandarihu> Well, hopefully the way the world is changing is going to inspire you. Hopefully you will be inspired to do something good instead of wrong.
<HoodyNinja> ^
<Lunar_Brony> I'm a teenager and I have enough problems on hand
<p4ngya> i would call it more of an identity crisis
<Zuxxez123> I still inspire to be like AJIsAwesome, but I need to keep something busy until I can reach those goals. :3
<HoodyNinja> Too bad "Philosipher" isn't technically a job
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome has a job?
<RAWRity> you know, if I were the one doing the Guess That Tune, I'd be fucking with people's google-fu by choosing foreign language songs
<Polydunami|Busy> I'm busy :P

<Polydunami|Busy> I'll be back in a few minutes

<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: I don't.
<p4ngya> HoodyNinja: it could be if you wrote about your philosophical views i guess
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if I did Guess that Tune, it'd be all video game music
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: That's seems like a good idea.
<HoodyNinja> p4ngya: Yes, but who would waste their time reading my crap?
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: Alright; I'll stop with that. :3
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Thank you.....:$
<Lunar_Brony> how much Nintendo music would be in it SaxyPretender?
<RAWRity> What's worse, it would have to be named in the original language.
<HoodyNinja> If I did guess that tune, I would sing the songs so you wouldn't get it right away
<SaxyPretender> 0,14probably not much
<RAWRity> Let's see somebody guess きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ - ファッションモンスタ
<Lunar_Brony> then I would fail miserably
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it'd be mainly fighting game music
<Zuxxez123> I know! I'll make a living making crappy fan fics! Yes! The most fail safe plan ever! I'll be rich!
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: inb4 SuperBrony64 kicks for saying that :D

<Yoshi> Can't; I've got hands.

<Phase4> 00,02no journaling, so no guarantees of integrity
<NENUDJUS> phase4 are you going to play some kerbal space program today?
<Phase4> 00,02NENUDJUS, maybe
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, do it!

<Tiberium126> F the law
<Panda|Packing> Phase4, well I wanna clean it all out because it has stupid stuff on it >.>
<Crystaline_Shard2> Phase4: can you Knick Crystaline_Shard?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02inb4 a 1 kB text document is in 67 different places

<Crystaline_Shard2> Ah thanks.
<Phase4> 00,02Panda|Packing, http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb456984.aspx
<Shizuka> 13never mind, asuka runs defragging without me :3
<Crystaline_Shard> :D
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, oh yeah, windows does background defrag now
<Laurayne> ???
<Shizuka> 13all six partitions are 0% fragged
<Shizuka> 13i'm so proud :3
<Panda|Packing> Phase4 I already knew that btw XD
<Shizuka> 13unless i specifically have to run this analysis
<Shizuka> 13inb4 100% frag
<Phase4> 00,02its why windows slams hard drives when your not using the machine, its defraging
<Phase4> 00,02leave your pc for a few minutes and the hdd light starts flashing
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13i hibernate so much i wouldn't be surprised if that fires a short defrag before powering down
<MadSurge> Shizuka: your computers are cool :)
<Shizuka> 13sure seems to max out drive and cpu when going into hibernate
<Shizuka> 13< oh my sounds serious
<Tiberium126> why not 120%
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, why does windows max the hdd before it starts saving ram
<Panda|Packing> Psy is on TV... AGAIN
<RoboGerbil> Shizuka: it does that because it saves whats in ram to the swap so you dont lose info
<Phase4> 00,02Panda|Packing, this is bad thing?
<Panda|Packing> xD a little
<Shizuka> 13yeah i know that :3
<Panda|Packing> they are rubbing the Gangnam style into the dirt >.>
<Phase4> 00,02RoboGerbil, it runs the hdd before that though for no aparent reason
<Spectrum_Rush> ok... so does anyone wanna just sock that sniveling worm guy
<Shizuka> 13pretty much hibernate every night now, and yeah it chugs pretty good, like way more than any game ever does
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hahahahaha

<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah, NewSuperBronyU: you seen gravity falls yet?
*Panda|Packing has never seen gravity falls
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Just looked it up, you mean that Disney show?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Buytoast> is a good show
<Phase4> 00,02WATCH NOW

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nah, I don't watch shows for little girls.
<Panda|Packing> ^
<Shizuka> 13wut

<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, o u, but its ok cause its for little boys and girls
<Shizuka> 13watt
<sub06905|TARDIS> dat 8 bit gandam style
<Buytoast> but it has soos
<Buytoast> and books
<Buytoast> and a hat
<Tiberium126> Watching shows for little boys is to mainstream
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shizuka> 13guess i do have to specifically run the analysis
<Pinkies4thWall> HE TALKS
<Shizuka> 13which says asuka's main drive is 3% fragged :3
<Pinkies4thWall> NO WAY
<sub06905|TARDIS> i miss the wii commercials with the two japanese dudes
<Tiberium126> JOIN
<Pinkies4thWall> Party
<sub06905|TARDIS> its a trap!
<Buytoast> dont trust them
<Queen_Chrysalis> :D xbx live
<Tiberium126> I remember the sounds of xbox...
<Shizuka> 13wasn't that a movie

<Moopy> Hey Superbrony tell JDM Works90 i said whats up
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, how fragmented are your other partitions?
<Shizuka> 130
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Tiberium126> CoD yuk
<Shizuka> 13two are system partitions from gateway, normally hidden
<DeathStar> for some reason I think Sb... likes the wiiU
<Shizuka> 13the other three are rei the external drive, all 0%
<taoumi> i'm fairly sure to make you mic line in become part of your sound out
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol is this the black ops 2 interview? it is :D
<Shizuka> 13though i guess that makes sense cause i rarely delete stuff from the externals
<Phase4> 00,02two things i need to do, one: get windows embeded from dreamspark and see how much stuff i can remove, two: get block re-ordering working on linux to improve boot speed
<Panda|Packing> Phase4, optimise?
<Phase4> 00,02optimize'
<Panda|Packing> forgive my spelling
<Panda|Packing> im tired >.<
<Phase4> 00,02Panda|Packing, and yes, its like defragmenting but moving into usefull places instead of just sequential
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> optimize prime operated by peter cullen

<MadSurge> DeathStar: well played maam *claps*

<Panda|Packing> Polydunami where in texas?
<NENUDJUS> is it just me or is this not loading?
<Polydunami> Not completely sure
<DeathStar> ooh look the buffer show~
<Tiberium126> If your happy and you know it clap your hoofs.
*DeathStar claps twice
*NewSuperBronyU glomps DeathStar
*DeathStar huggles NewSuperBronyU :3
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: how many days is it now?
<Spectrum_Rush> so anyone remember this one :S http://i.imgur.com/ZONzp.jpg
<NENUDJUS> someone needs to make a cheek and chong ponys! ASAP!
<Ninjazz> San Diego to El Paso iirc.
<Ninjazz> Yay Texas.
<Ninjazz> Grrrr. More goddamn lag.
<Ninjazz> I wonder if this is how otakon feels.
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, well, it's usually at 200 ping level. Yellow bar. This is more of a bad position to be.
*Ninjazz doesn't ever clap.
*Ninjazz NEVER claps.
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, you can see my "^" in that one.
<Ninjazz> Also LAG KICKED.
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: dat lag, and yeah i'm in it too :>
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, I had a clone! :O
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush: what was that show? :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Redline
<Panda|Packing> NENUDJUS uh... cheech and chong ponies? hm...
<Panda|Packing> REDLINE?
<Panda|Packing> WHERE
<DeathStar> Ninjazz: if you never clap dose that mean your not happy or your happy but you don't know it?
<NENUDJUS> it would be awesome
<Ninjazz> DeathStar, ...Hmmm. Probably not happy.
<Ninjazz> I'd know when I'm happy.
<Ninjazz> I smile when I do. :>
*Panda|Packing doesnt clap
<Tiberium126> Ninjazz, clap your hoofs
<DeathStar> Ninjazz: but i don't want you to be not happy :(
<Panda|Packing> why you ask?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz is still less grumpy than Meanwhile :D
<Panda|Packing> because pandas cant clap
<DeathStar> Panda|Packing: pandas can so clap!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, NO ONE bests Meanwhile in grump levels.
*Tiberium126 Claps his hoofs...
<Panda|Packing> DeathStar, no if a panda claps it creates a time warp that will rip it in half, hence why they are endangered
<Ninjazz> Because Meanwhile is British. British people are born with snark. And snark is half grump and halp sarcasm.
<Panda|Packing> Ninjazz, uh... I think i could give him a run for his money >.>
<Ninjazz> Tiberium126, sorry mate. I don't do things unless I mean them.
<DeathStar> Panda|Packing: so that "if your happy and you know it" song killed all the pandas?
<Ninjazz> DeathStar, I'm sorry. :(
*DeathStar huggles Ninjazz
<Panda|Packing> DeathStar yes.
<Ninjazz> Panda|Packing, VERY doubtful.
<DeathStar> Panda|Packing: :'(
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I posted this comment to a video on YouTube: "Yeah, sure.﻿ I'm also not a Brony, I'm just a crazy internet geek who likes colorful ponies on the internet."
*Ninjazz hugs DeadpoolDash back.
<Panda|Packing> SB XD
<Ninjazz> HAHAHA.
*Spectrum_Rush dat feel when you're looming thru old bookmarks... and you find one for Ponibooru :<
*Ninjazz hugs DeathStar back.*
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I got this as a response:
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02"you're also not a faggot or waste of human resources, you're just homosexual and a useless expense"
<DeathStar> oh DeadpoolDash why must you steal my pings~ XD
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/607284550442d0c29fc6278615dfe8b0.jpg have this for not being too grumpy :)
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, dat feel. T_T
<Tiberium126> NewSuperBronyU, lol thats a great comeback
<Panda|Packing> I love how ponies = Faggot.... every gay person I know personally says ponies are stupid XD
<Spectrum_Rush> MadSurge: that'll just make him sad, since it'll probably cost to much or not be for sale
<Ninjazz> NewSuperBronyU, sure smells 4chan.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It makes me feel sad...I don't think I did anything to warrant such a response...
<DeathStar> Panda|Packing: my favorite gay guy likes ponys. I can't covince him to watch friendship is magic though :(
<Buytoast> le epic troll must be 4chan XDDD ;P
<Tiberium126> Calling a brony a faggot is offensive to bikies
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: you didn't :( he's just a stupid head
<Panda|Packing> DeathStar hehe yeah.
<Panda|Packing> FUN FACT: A faggot is a bundle of sticks.
<Tiberium126> and a bikie :D
<MadSurge> Ninjazz and Spectrum_Rush: well, this is not on sale :D http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/b0f98c1ddaacad23497fc598f4b48a53.jpg

*Ninjazz waves the United Equestrian banner.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello LightTrooper105
*LightTrooper105 give Ninjazz and DoctoDoctorWho and AdamTheDuck cheese
*DoctoDoctorWho noms on cheese
*Ninjazz melts the cheese down to fondu and gives it to charity.
*DoctoDoctorWho is regrettably too much of a greedy bastard to give to charity
<LightTrooper105> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tiberium126, that's a bit hypocrtical
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix: I was jokinh
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: was there a pm conversation I missed here?
<DoctoDoctorWho> and hi CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/niGBPR_t5R8 FRENCH
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hoy
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix: I repect someone for not having an interest in MLP
<AdamTheDuck> Hello CrimsonPhoenix
<DoctoDoctorWho> oh, I see
<DoctoDoctorWho> CrimsonPhoenix: U arent a brony?
<Ninjazz> I think I'llw watch a bit of Discovery or History for a bit.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, I don't know how to respond to that
<NENUDJUS> im back everypony!
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenix is a brownie.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I may be one or I may be not but would that change the fact that I watch My Little Pony?
<NENUDJUS> mmm
*Tiberium126 hugs DoctoDoctorWho, AdamTheDuck, CrimsonPhoenix, NENUDJUS, LightTrooper105 and Ninjazz
<NENUDJUS> Ninjazz: can you fill mr in on this?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Do I need to label myself to continue watching the show?
*Ninjazz is hugged out of no where?
<Ninjazz> NENUDJUS, what are you saying?
<NENUDJUS> my i ask why you are here if you are not one?
<DoctoDoctorWho> CrimsonPhoenix: If you are a male outside the target age group and like/watch the show, you are by definition a brony.
<NENUDJUS> Ninjazz: i dont know what going on i just came back
<CrimsonPhoenix> Possibly
*DoctoDoctorWho hugs Tiberium126 back
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho: I think he is messing with you
<CrimsonPhoenix> or maybe I really do not care abot the actual word itself and continue to watch the show
<Ninjazz> NENUDJUS, Oh. I see.
<AdamTheDuck> Finally found it, the winning P.A.R.T.Y. http://fav.me/d417vyv
<Hanako> Are you impplying girls can't be bronies?
<DoctoDoctorWho> CrimsonPhoenix: well your not a hater so I guess the point is moot
<Hanako> *implying
<Ninjazz> I'm just going to watch some educational television. CrimsonPhoenix is saying that he doesn't need to be labeled anything to be considered a fan of MLP. Personally, I consider myself a brony because that's my choice.
<CrimsonPhoenix> What Ninjazz said
<NENUDJUS> mhmm
<NENUDJUS> ..
<CrimsonPhoenix> if you feel the need to label yourself then be my guest
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hanako: not really, the term "brony" is a non gender specific term
<Hanako> Good.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, I could argue with the whole prefix bro.
<NENUDJUS> (BRO _ PONY) non gender?
<DoctoDoctorWho> That whole "pegasister" thing is just silly
<NENUDJUS> omfg yay!
<NENUDJUS> stream!!!
<Ryunosuke> mine ears!
<Tiberium126> who is this?
<NENUDJUS> i love you!
<OneTrickStudy> dat sudden stream
<NENUDJUS> it you phase4 i can tell look at all them tabs
<DoctoDoctorWho> I can see myself
<Phase4> NENUDJUS, needs more tabs
<Hanako> okay so
<Hanako> /b/ro
<taoumi> damn you Phase4 alwase scareign me
<NENUDJUS> :p
<Mutterguy> MOAR TABS!!!
<Hanako> /b/rother
<Phase4> taoumi, Success!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hanako, YOU TASTE LIKE BACON
<AdamTheDuck> Whoa that was scary XD
<Hanako> /b/rony
<Hanako> CrimsonPhoenix: That's not very nice.
<Ninjazz> But is it true?
<Hanako> Doubtful.
<DoctoDoctorWho> NENUDJUS: Bro is gender neutral, girls can be bros too
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hanako, sorry I just had to reference a favorite video of mine
<Ninjazz> ./b/ronies didn't start the fandom, /co/ did. /b/ just made it popular.
<NENUDJUS> i have the demo for KSP is it a big diff between them the full game and the demo?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ninjazz: of course, mlp has been around since the 1980's
<NENUDJUS> like i cant even go to the moon on the demo
<Ninjazz> I'm referring to G4.
<NENUDJUS> never mind the galaxy
<Ninjazz> MLP's existence before G4 wasn't as controversial as it is now.
<Mutterguy> DoctoDoctorWho, Those aren't the ponies we know or love.
<Hanako> >implying G3.5 isn't the best MLP
<Ninjazz> Especially not G3's Rarity.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Of course bronies started the fandom for g4 then, there wasnt a fandom before that!
<CrimsonPhoenix> DoctoDoctorWho, I'm sorry but what?
<Ninjazz> >Implying G3.6 isn't best nightmare fuel.
<CrimsonPhoenix> There was a fandom for older generation thank you
<GreeTheGermanBrony> G3.6 doesn't exist
<CrimsonPhoenix> you forgot there are fan forums that actually collect the toys and all
<DoctoDoctorWho> And anything g3 related can burn in a hole, no wait, that would waste a perfectly good hole.
<Ninjazz> Ohkay. Whatever you say. :>
<Ninjazz> Where's Caramel when you need him?
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat alex s robot rock

<Mega_Milk> meh
<Lil_B> aww, so excited, I was working on a Remix of the Home theme from Shin Onigashima with Japanese Instruments. I love Ethnic Stuff :3
<Sylandest> how well did it come out, Lil_B?
<AdamTheDuck> 'Cause I feel like posting a somewhat-depressing song :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su_qp6Z7BmA
<AdamTheDuck> ^ for some reason I find it beatiful
<RainbowPie> MadSurge: I love both so im happy
<Lil_B> Sylandest it sounds very good in my opinion, just have to make as decent ending now (almost done) and than render it and upload it , should be ready in 2 hours :)
<Sylandest> Lil_B: woo! I'll be in class at that time, but if I get the chance to hear it, I'll be sure to ask, hehe
<AdamTheDuck> So Lil_B, with the name thing, what kind of names are you looking for? :3
<Lil_B> Sylandest I always love to show my stuff to people, I just often don't ask about it because i don't wanna rub it in anyones faces (and I often think I do :( )
*Sylandest hugs Lil_B
<Sylandest> you silly! You're not rubbing it in
<Phase4> RainbowPie, Ping
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck I still have no Idea how to call me, everything I'Äve come up with so far I didn't liked anymore after a day :(
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, rubbing it in? No I'm sure many of us would love to see your works.
<Sylandest> ^
<AdamTheDuck> I just want something to ponder with as I stare at my ceiling before I sleep :P
<AdamTheDuck> Something to keep me thinking for the next few days~
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck I would like something short, something that doesn't sound so random (like TheWoodenToaster etc, nothing against the artist) and if possible something german :P
<Lil_B> the last 2 things that came To my mind was Nulkl Ouvert and Tohuwabohu (or Tabularasa) but these look really strange written down XD
<AdamTheDuck> Short? Damn, I like extended name s:3
<AdamTheDuck> names :3*
<Lil_B> Null Ouvert*
<Lil_B> or something that Begins with Ben, because of my actual name :)
<ekips> LilBen?
<Lil_B> ekips maybe :/ I was thinking about just derivating from Lil B and not schanging it completly, but yeah, I'm still debating with myself about everything :)
<Dark92Enigma> Hello everypony!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Dark92Enigma
<Lil_B> hello there Dark92Enigma
<Sylandest> howdy Dark92Enigma :)
<Dark92Enigma> no stream, right?
<Sylandest> not at the moment, no
<AdamTheDuck> Nope Dark92Enigma
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> i never got why Shizuka puts Shizuschlafen everytime she's absent.....
<Dark92Enigma> Hi ASoftFluffyThing!
<ekips> schlafen is german for sleeping Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> oh, should've known better 6_9
<Dark92Enigma> sadly, i know little to no german
<Dark92Enigma> i said it......
<Lil_B> Shizuka isn't german, but she is very close to VioletVanilla, who is german, and I guess thats why Shizuka sometimes is that way :)
<Ninjazz> It's not that heard to guess though.

<AdamTheDuck> Alright I'm off to bed, goodnight everyone :)
<Randomnerd> Bye, AdamTheDuck
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst normal mp3 or other codecs like ACC usually cut away parts of the Audio to compress it. lossless or codecs that really only cut out the frequenzes that you can't possibly hear to compremise the music, therefore the songs need more memory

<Eli_Berlin> Lil_B: stores are closed today anyways. most of them at least... happy B-day german union :)

<MadSurge> Saturn: awwww :'( any plans on getting new ones?
<Dken2021> well they say sarcasm is not translated well over the internet

<Dken2021> feel free to have some of the roaming kitties here Saturn, they belong to nobody
<Panda> Saturn, you could get another kitty and name it junior ^^ Thats what I did to get over the loss. Though it became habitual and I had 7ths and 8ths >.>
<Lil_B> Eli_Berlin I have a Karstadt in my Town too, but only a smaller one, it only has Fillys :/
<Lil_B> Eli_Berlin hope you'll get Lucky ^^
<Invi> Lil_B, do a pagan ritual that makes them replace those fillies by real ponies ^^
<GilDash> Invi: Can we do one to summon Celestia?
<Eli_Berlin> Lil_B: i don't even know what the hell these "fillys" are supposed to be... they are a G3 ripp off...
<Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: no idea; she was a stray

*Colt_Brovakiin huggles puffmuffins
<Eli_Berlin> Applejack2012: "Filly" is everywhere... i even get them everywhere in switzerland, but they remind me of G3 too much
*smelt doesnt want to attract attention and worry everypony with my existence and bails
*Dken2021 lurk hugs puffmuffins while he wasn't looking
<puffmuffins> yay
<Invi> GilDash, okay then I tell you how to do it: hit your head with a sledgehammer until you start to see ponies. But beware: You wil never be able to return...
<GilDash> Wrek: Us? Silent? Not happening anytime soon. :D
<puffmuffins> rofl
<GilDash> Invi: ... I'm desperate, not insane, silly. :p
<Eli_Berlin> I would like too meet a brony while i'm here; I have a feel, that a real live brohoof feels much more awesome than a viritual one /)

<Saturn> 08,01when i first got into MLP, i was in Germany
<Eli_Berlin> Saturn: dat
<Panda> Fuck Filly?

<Saturn> 08,01first time i went to buy blind bags, all i could find was fucking Filly
<Eli_Berlin> Panda: it's a MLP rippoff sold everywhere in middle europe
<Invi> GilDash, then ask holy Dio ^^
<ekips> I'm thinking of getting Guns Of Icarus Online. Someone else already playing it? I need some reassurance before.
<Panda> Eli_Berlin, what?
<BladedWings> Wrek: What class are you?

<Invi> Saturn, does he eat batsß :D
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: he actually does
<GilDash> Ozzy... I don't know how he's still rocking, yet alone how he's still alive, but he's bloody awesome anyway. :)
<Invi> Saturn, I am not surprised ^^
<Ninjazz> Love his accent.
<thisguy> i'm wondering whether or not to try out end of nations o.O
<Eli_Berlin> Panda: imagine fake MLP toys that look like 3.6. combine it with your worst nightmare, and there you have "Filly"
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: coincidentally, i've just been listening to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath
<Saturn> 08,01you may hate me for it, but it's actually one of my favourite albums
<GilDash> Saturn: I've had days like that all past week.
<Lil_B> Yeah, Filly REALLY looks a lot like 3.5
<Panda> Eli_Berlin, hm.. as long as it isnt g3.5 scoots... im fine
<Saturn> 08,01"but saturn!", i hear you cry, "what about Paranoid and Master of Reality?"
<Eli_Berlin> Panda: it's close
<GilDash> Saturn: To be honest, I've not really listened to much Black Sabbath. I've been meaning to ever since I saw them at Download this year though.
<Saturn> 08,01to which i will reply: only by a small margin
<Wirisme> I haven't either GilDash
<Wirisme> and by that I mean barely at all
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: i got my mum into Sabbath; she now has 5 Sabbath CDs in her car, which she listens to when she drives
<Saturn> 08,01it's become her car music
<GilDash> I know Paranoid, obviously though. XD

<Eli_Berlin> Invi: i don't like them either. but from time to time a trance club or a drum and bass concert can't hurt. (lies it hurts like hell. don't go to pendulum if you don't wanna get hurt.)
<thisguy> yay a pony :)
<Ninjazz> Ded.
<GilDash> Eli_Berlin: Pendulum are fine. Just get your mosh on. XD
<Kammerjunk> I can't decide whether you should live or die~
<Invi> Eli_Berlin, I would want to go to Wacken, but it's already sold out :<
<Ninjazz> Pendulum? PENDULUM?! Pendulum. <3
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Living would be preferable, please.
<Eli_Berlin> GilDash: i've been so sore after my past 2 pendulum concerts :)
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, Oh you'll probably go to heaven, please don't hang your head and cry.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, you'll probably go to Heaven. Please don't hang your head and cry.
<Ninjazz> I wonder why.
<Kammerjunk> Consarnit.
<Eli_Berlin> Ninjazz: ever seen them live?

<Kammerjunk> I do like a good cup of coffee.
<Ninjazz> ^
<Eli_Berlin> Ninjazz: whenever they are in the country my best firend an I are there :P
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Come over to the UK! I'm sure I can sort something out. ^_^
<Eli_Berlin> Ninjazz: which is way to rarely. they are in the UK and US now
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: in autumn and winter here it's almost a ghost town. Thankfully we live close to the town center
<Ninjazz> Eli_Berlin, GilDash, Mum says we're going to Europe next year. This.... works.

*Panda is a scootaloo
<Sumica> 00,10hey wrek I got the beta code!
*Ninjazz flies evrytiem.
<Kammerjunk> Panda: Sitting in a big metal contraptions thousands of metres above the ground for a few hours? What could go wrong?
<Kammerjunk> contraption*
<Eli_Berlin> Panda: i was worried too. this here was my first flight (since i was 2). but it was really chill¨. the turbulences were even fun :)
<Applejack2012> I'm a Scoot too
<Panda> Afraid of heights and cant swim... I dont wanna be stuck on this continent for the rest of my life!!!
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: They're very safe really.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I know.
<Kammerjunk> Not my first rodeo.
<GilDash> Of course, that all depends on the pilot.
<Panda> Kammerjunk, you arent helping /)_(\
<Kammerjunk> :D
<Invi> Panda, then come to germany :D
<GilDash> It's more being sat for hours... unable to move... -_-
<Panda> Invi that still requires flying, I'm in the US
*Panda cant fly
<Dken2021> GilDash sounds exciting
<Kammerjunk> Last time I flew, I had my Nintendo DS.
<Kammerjunk> 'Twas a while back.
<Invi> Panda then take a boat ^^
<Ninjazz> Dken2021, it's not.... It's not even funny.
<Wirisme> I haven't flown in 5 years
<Panda> Invi i cant swim, so I have a natural fear of water....
<GilDash> Dken2021: Oh, it's a right laugh...
<Eli_Berlin> aaanyways, if anyone comes to switzerland any time soon, hit me up. i can get you from the airport & everything. i kinda know this country. (easy, since it's no bigger than most of your cities alone)
<Invi> Panda, I know that feel ^^ maybe i gona visit you somewhen whgen i gotz time and monies ^^
<Kammerjunk> The best thing on a plane is to break out your laptop and mess with the battery.
<Panda> Eli_Berlin, as long as you dont wanna get me drunk just to steal my organs and leave me to die in the middle of the road... im fine ^^
<Panda> Invi dat would be awesome D:
<Panda> :D*
<Barbetos> Hi!

<Wirisme> hullo barbetos
<Panda> Barbetos, arent you a jamacian city?
<Barbetos> I am in a awfully good mood today, and I am worried. I must need to go see a doctor or something like that.
<Panda> Eli_Berlin ;) great minds think alike.
<Panda> wait

<Dken2021> Barbetos maybe that's a good thing
<Wirisme> Enjoy your good mood :)
<Eli_Berlin> Panda: i'm never gonna visit you, that's for sure...
<Barbetos> >good mood
<Barbetos> >sure sign of some illness
<Wirisme> sounds like the best illness ever
<Barbetos> Actually. I was really happy to spot a tube of tooth paste with pinkie pie on it.
<Panda> Barbetos, you took your happy doses, nothing is wrong :D
<Barbetos> Its the small things really.
<Panda> Barbetos WHERE!

<Wirisme> hmmm
<Applejack2012> hello
<Wirisme> pinkie pie
<Barbetos> It was with the tooth paste here at my local wal mart. It almost stoled my money when I saw it
<Wirisme> + toothpaste
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Walmart. Why you not in Denmark.
<killerpony7733> Panda GilDas Darnit you two and your IRC clients :D
<Applejack2012> Come on and smiole

<GilDash> killerpony7733: We're so cool. XD
<Dken2021> hey there killerpony7733
<Panda> Barbetos, its not stealing if you want it~
<Applejack2012> hey
<Wirisme> If that happened here...
<Panda> killerpony7733, think you spelled a name wrong there XD
<Barbetos> Five finger discount.
<Wirisme> I'd probably react the same
<Invi> Panda, it actually is, no matter if you want it or not ^^
<killerpony7733> Panda Ya think? :P
<Barbetos> And before you ask, I do have five fingers. None of that four fingers and a thumb.
<GilDash> Invi: Can you explain the banker bailout to me then, please? XD
<Panda> killerpony7733 :P nope, when do I ever think?
<Panda> Barbetos, wasnt gonna ask. I have hooves, umad?
<Kammerjunk> I went to the drive-around-for-hours-and-pet-animals-place the other day, ponies galore. None of them were technicolour, though.
<Panda> *gasp*
<Panda> AJIsAwesome!
<AJIsAwesome> Panda! :)
<Barbetos> Panda with hooves. No.. not mad. I am just wondering how life works that way, for a panda I mean.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, everyone! How are you all today? :)
<Barbetos> Confusion. Yep. Confused.
<Panda> Barbetos, panda with hooves :)
<Wirisme> Hi AJIsAwesome !

<Vordox> Which mod loved Nicolas Cage? Was it prince-dari ? Scoot-Scootaloo?
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Nicholas Cage is a good actor.
<Kammerjunk|TOR> I'm sorry, I just cracked up.
<Ninjazz> Nic Cage is best everything.
<Wirisme> He really knows how to express hatred of bees
<Vordox> Nic Cage is EVERYTHING?
<Vordox> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/5491786_460s_v1.jpg
<Ninjazz> Except an actor.
<Wirisme> and women
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Vordox: I would watch everything there.
<Vordox> Kammerjunk|TOR: :D
<Wirisme> and how killing him doesn't bring back your goddamn honey

<Kurra> oooh≥
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, MaxTheBrony! :)
<MaxTheBrony> Heya AJIsAwesome ! :)
<alexxm> how are things AJIsAwesome
<Applejack2012> good evening
<AJIsAwesome> Pretty good, alexxm. How about you? :)
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Ha ha! The entertainment has been doubled!
<alexxm> is there still a stream because i have nothing on my end
<Wrek> 05yes there is
<alexxm> i'm good AJIsAwesome
<Pinkielover123> Hi.
<Ninjazz> Hey Pinkielover123.
<Applejack2012> hi
<Ninjazz> Oh yeah. Are you Alliance or Horde?
<Pinkielover123> ?
<Applejack2012> cya
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Alliance, Horde... These Pandas are all the same to me
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Pinkielover123 :)
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Wait, that didn't come out right.
<Ninjazz> FOR LORDERON.
<Ninjazz> (sp)
<Pinkielover123> I see a desktop pony.
<Kurra> Lordaeron?
<Ninjazz> And I haven't played WC3 in ages.
<Ninjazz> Yes, ty Kurra.
<twilight_sprinkle> horde territories suck, i cant stand the bright orange durotar and orgrimmar
<Kurra> Hoof up if you play WoW as much just to see the beauty of the world, than to play it. .)
<Kurra> (\
<twilight_sprinkle> (\ (used to play)
<Ninjazz> Does it count if I would /want/ to but don't?
<Kurra> yeah?
<Lil_B> well, finally have Shin Onigashima Arrangement Uploaded :)
<Ninjazz> /)
<twilight_sprinkle> why dont you play it Ninjazz ?
<Ninjazz> Subscription.
<Kurra> Also hoof up if you spent time in the Metroid Prime worlds just to explore their beauty too, as well as play /)
<Shizuka> 13hate mornings like this... so much sneezing...
<Pinkielover123> I used to play WoW.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: you mean monthly payments?
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Haha WC3 was my first online game and i remember playing sooooo many customs maps
<Pinkielover123> TILL THEY ADDED PANDAS.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, eyup. Also didn't want to waste money when my internet was pretty crap.
*twilight_sprinkle whispers to Ninjazz "private serveeeeeeers....."
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, Custom matches... Oh my God the sustom matches. I got SO good at tank battles.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, did that too. Lost interest.
*Kurra grabs scrubby cloth, bath c|
<Shizuka> 13then everything changed when the panda nation attacked
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: why?
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, not sure. Just... didn't click with me. :/
<Pinkielover123> Yes shizuka.
<Pinkielover123> Buffer.
<alexxm> what side are the pandas on
<Ninjazz> I don't see why people complain. Pandas have been in the WC universe since WC3 and NO ONE complained then.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yep so many maps i loved like you know the war of azeroth maps and all where you took a faction and area and you played out the natural events of the lore and even so could just change it entirely :D
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yeppers
<Pinkielover123> I don't like pandas.
<Pinkielover123> Lagging.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, Oohh mai god the nostalgia.
<Pinkielover123> Bronystate lags alot for me.
*Pinkielover123 Eats a muffin " True story."
<Ninjazz> Remember when all there was to play was DOTA maps?
<twilight_sprinkle> pandas are evil, they kill you and steal our corpse if you dont buy their cheese
<twilight_sprinkle> ew dota
<Pinkielover123> LOL TWILIGHT.
<Ninjazz> I gave it a shot. People started kicking when they /ping'd me. -_-
<twilight_sprinkle> dota would be more fun if not for the community
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Oh and titan defense or whatever it's called where you choose a builder race and you setup defenses and bases and steal gold from the titan and advance tech and hopefully have a undestroyable base
<Ninjazz> "GU!" "GU!"
<alexxm> so what do the pandas do that are differant
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, hahaha yeah! God I sucked at that one.
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: theyre big and fluffy!:3
<Pinkielover123> I miss desktop ponies,
<Ninjazz> Also, LOAPs.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Too many maps that i just really liked.
<Pinkielover123> What happened to the website?
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Oh god those!
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, IKR.
<GilDash|Away> And I come back to... is that Soundgarden?
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz I remember always running the mayor job cause it mean't free money and i didn't do squat
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, drug lord all day every day.
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkielover123: ?
<Pinkielover123> You said pandas are evil.
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: smokin weed erryday
<Ninjazz> Always hilarious when my daughter decides to side with the cops and take my empire. >_<
<Pinkielover123> OH NO BUFFER.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, drugs make you powerful.
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkielover123: i know, but you said something happened to the website
<Pinkielover123> Yeah.
<Wrek> 05Pinkielover123: you seem to be the only one with buffer
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<Pinkielover123> I cant find it.
<Wrek> 05so stop complainign 24/7 theres nothign i can do about it
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkielover123: which site?
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yeah i remember them. Sometimes one of those players got too powerful and just trolled the heck out of ya, but it was rather balanced out since the police got them
<Pinkielover123> Desktop ponies.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: One Day One Dollar Donation Drive for Kiki's Cancer Fund
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkielover123: oh, hm let me check
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Argh but yes some of the drug lord players for no reason just set a hostile path agaisnt everyone
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, yeah. but it ALWAYS sucked when the cops were pricks.
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkielover123: huh, youre right, the link to that site doesnt work anymore
<Ninjazz> Not me. Want drugs, just ask.
<Ninjazz> Everything was airei.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Hah yeah either way you were screwed by either the police or drug lord but in some cases they were nice and all cool and only kept a war against each other never hurting the other players
<Pinkielover123> Maybe updating...
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<Pinkielover123> 1...2..3.
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkielover123: on a different site where you can download it, it says "As of 2012-09-09, this project is no longer under active development."
<Pinkielover123> Aw.
<Pinkielover123> They stopped it.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, I LOVED those games. The one game where peasants could just get a job and stick or stick in away from the general and major conflicts.
<Pinkielover123> That was the most best idea.
<Ninjazz> Wrek, aight. Thanks for streaming the expansion.
<twilight_sprinkle> Pinkielover123: yeah, you can still downloaded it from other sites tho
<Pinkielover123> I have browser ponies.
<Ninjazz> Glad that there was minimal complaining about pandas.
<GilDash> Wrek: More talking! :)
<Kammerjunk|TOR> 'Twas fun.
<Kammerjunk|TOR> I think I just depleted my vocabulary.
<Pinkielover123> xD
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Yep but idunno i hated the enforcing and factions that could make soldiers and all so i generally kept to those simple peasants and had a simple job and just stat spammed with drugs. Which reminds me i remember some really awesome guys that asked if you wanted to be allies and they gave you lotsa free drugs to enforce them and you had a pretty damn strong peasant
<Pinkielover123> Tigers.
<Pinkielover123> Tigers everywhere.
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I assume this is a game you're talking about and that you and Ninjazz aren't actual drug runners IRL. XD
<Snow> heya everypony!
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Oh, kill quests.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, it almost got tedious spamming the numberpad button.
<Ninjazz> GilDash, Custom maps. :>
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Maps for what game?
<killerpony7733> GilDash WC3 yes and the metric ton of maps that was made at it's time
<GilDash> Oh, I see...
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Maps for the map god.
<Pinkielover123> Seeya.
<BladedWings|HW> bye Wrek
<Wirisme> bye wrek
<Pinkielover123> Lol twilight got mad for the video freezing.
<killerpony7733> GilDash What were you expecting me and Ninjazz do that stuff? :D
<GilDash> Wrek: See ya! L(
<BladedWings|HW> thanks for the stream
<GilDash> *:)
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Hey, I don't expect anything any more. XD
<killerpony7733> GilDash Hah but yes if you didn
<killerpony7733> didn't catch it we said we talked about WC3 i get'cha
<Ninjazz> LOAPs. :3
<Pinkielover123> Bored.
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Well, I knew it was some kind of game, but last I checked WC3 didn't have any drugs, so I didn't make that connection. XD
*sonicandmario85 sneaks into the chat
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz But alas too many custom maps to remember that just were sooooo much damn fun

<Pinkielover123> K.
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Can't be shut down? Is that a challenge?
<Snow> yes
<sonicandmario85> Snow:you have to win the game to shut it down
<Snow> try shutting it down without using the power button on your pc
<sonicandmario85> Snow:YOU HAVE TO WIN IT TO MAKE IT CLOSE
<GilDash> Okay. Yank the power cable.
<GilDash> Failing that, turn the plug off by the wall.
<GilDash> I win. ^_^
<Snow> or at least dont press escape
<sonicandmario85> Snow:HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?
<Snow> that was my fault
<Pinkielover123> NO.
<Kammerjunk|TOR> Aww, you can close it by pressing escape? No fun.

<Pinkielover123> Ok.
<Snow> kammerjunk|TOR: umm, it closes it, temporary
<Kammerjunk|TOR> End Process?
<GilDash> Alt + Ctrl + Del?

<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka stream, YEAAAAH
<Snow> where is sandvich?
<Dark_Horst> heavy lags here
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Do you like honey?
<Snow> WHO TOUCHED MY SANDVICH!?
<Dark_Horst> mips, why you hate germany so much?
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: Doug himself said he will bring the character back for a few special occasions, but the show will not be weekly anymore, that's all
<Kammerjunk> Honey is fairly good.
<Pinkielover123> :'(
<Meanwhile> Then yeah, try it. Just try not to turn your tea into syrup.
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka, everyone. Pony toys TF style: http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/400844_450760454963172_2032489959_n.jpg
<Kammerjunk> Alrighty then, will try.
*Pinkielover123 Crys
<Pinkielover123> WAHHH.
*Snow steals rarity spy
<Dark_Horst> anyone else lagging?
<Snow> ITS MINE
<Pinkielover123> Guys.
<Meanwhile> Well, I'm sure this'd be...something. If it weren't buffering every ten seconds.
<Pinkielover123> Nonthing is there.
<ASoftFluffyThing> J_E_Smith71: WEHRE ARE THESE TOYS?
<Pinkielover123> I don't see anything
<Pinkielover123> Just a bufffer and a black backgroud.
<J_E_Smith71> ASoftFluffyThing: Custom i guess
<Pinkielover123> * Buffer background
<Meanwhile> Try the blue refresh vutton.
<Meanwhile> button*

<Meanwhile> Oh. I refreshed and now I've got nothing.
<Snow> GLORIOUS
<CCCP> two of my friends hate bronies, that all they ever seen to talk about when im near them, what do?

<Pinkielover123> I don't see this.
<Pinkielover123> I don't see anything.
<Pinkielover123> At all
<Dark_Horst> who'S streaming
<Kammerjunk> A wild SB appears.
<ASoftFluffyThing> CCCP tell them that always doing that is annoying. If they don't stop, constantly talk about something they like and rant about it
<Snow> waaaaaaaaait
<MadSurge> It's still buffering though
<Snow> i know this
<CCCP> Meanwhile but i liek them :I
*NewSuperBronyU glomps Pinkielover123
<Pinkielover123> Brony fix this.
<Pinkielover123> Me and meanwhile don't see the stream.
<Snow> is my music teacher streaming or sumthing?
<CCCP> ASoftFluffyThing bronies are the ponly thing they rant on
<CCCP> only*
<Shizuka> 13Maybe you'd prefer no stream at all?
<Pinkielover123> NO.
<Pinkielover123> I want a stream.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: Ikr :|
<ASoftFluffyThing> CCCP, well constantly rant about something they like when you're around them
<Snow> me too
<Meanwhile> Since I have no stream at all anyway it doesn't really matter.
<Pinkielover123> It's just.
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: no! no! keep it like this <3
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: I concur with ASoftFluffyThing.
<Pinkielover123> UGH THAT'S IT.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: mips seems wakky again. switch embed maybe?
<Kammerjunk> Ragequit?
<Pinkielover123> Still nonthing.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Instruments playing themselves? That's pretty awesome.
<CCCP> ASoftFluffyThing okies :3
<Pinkielover123> OH I SEE SOMETHING.
<Dark_Horst> it'S about 5 secons stream, 10 seconds buffer
<Pinkielover123> *Thing
<ASoftFluffyThing> CCCP, make sure to do it loud as possible
<Meanwhile> Well, I got it back to buffering every ten seconds instead of constantly...
<CCCP> ASoftFluffyThing :D
<CCCP> brb
<MadSurge> These bots are awesome!
<Pinkielover123> What's with this buffering?
<alexxm> so SNow whats that escape from lavender town game you mentioned
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: Entertaining.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pinkielover123, it's probably mips or your internet connection
<Pinkielover123> My internet is fine.
<Snow> >_><_< nothing alexxm
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/KDhFG.jpg
<BladedWings|HW> its buffering for me too
<Pinkielover123> Fix this NAO.
<Pinkielover123> Bronystate.
<Kammerjunk> Because mods = Indentured servents, right?
<Snow> can they do any kind of music?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Snow, I guess so.
<Meanwhile> Since they're cgi, probably.
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: it's just mips. does that from tiem to time, fail for no appearant reason
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Hey, I ain't complainin'.
<Kammerjunk> A wild ScootaChicken appears!
<Dark_Horst> it'S still a problem though. my stream jsut went dead, i'm guessing they're busy changing the embed now
<CCCP> hi ScootaChicken
<Dark_Horst> that or mips died completely
<Pinkielover123> Everyday i'm buffering.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello ScootaChicken
*Pinkielover123 Plays music
<Meanwhile> Great, it's taken me like, ten minutes to watch five minutes of this.
<Kammerjunk> Meh, happened when Wrek streamed few days ago too.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, have you tried refreshing the whole page? that sorta helps a tiny bit
<Kammerjunk> Silly mips.
<Dark_Horst> oh, there it is back
<Shizuka> 13I'm done.
<Meanwhile> Last time I did that I got nothing at all.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: hm?
<Pinkielover123> Huh?
<Meanwhile> 12 seconds without buffering. New record.
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Something the matter?
<MadSurge> Shizuka: :(
<Pinkielover123> HOLY SHIT A LAZER.
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Shizuka> 13I'm not going to sit through the entire playlist I prepared watching you all do nothing but whine about it.
<Shizuka> 13I'm done.
<MadSurge> Hope you're satisfied guys :|
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: we dont whine about the playlist. we just dont get anything here
<Pinkielover123> But we're buffering.
<Meanwhile> Not really, just we can't see shit.
<BladedWings|HW> oh crap we pissed of Shizuka ...i'm a little scared
<Kammerjunk> Heavens, no. It was mips being buggy.
<MadSurge> I'm buffering A LOT too, but I'm not bugging about it constantly
<BladedWings|HW> ^
<Pinkielover123> No need to get pissed off Shizuka.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I second MadSurge's statement
<Meanwhile> So has it actually stopped? Because mine is still stopping and starting.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I call magic.
<Barbetos> Nothing is streaming at the moment Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Oh right so you all can't see anything either but you just felt not saying anything was helpful.
<Pinkielover123> God.
<Meanwhile> Yeah, I bet that'd be really inspiring. If you didn't point out when something wasn't working.
<Pinkielover123> It was just buffering.
<Dark_Horst> buffering to the point where it wasnt working
<MadSurge> How would I have helped saying "it's not working"? You were already saying it
<Meanwhile> Because if we know that it's not working for everyone we recognise that it's a problem on the streamers end.
<Meanwhile> Or with the embed. It narrows down the list of solutions.
<Pinkielover123> Dumbass mips.
<CrazyCherry> It's funny how my stream has frozen on the spot where Wrek is looking at me.
<ASoftFluffyThing> CrazyCherry lolwut
<BladedWings|HW> well now it doesnt matter cause we pissed of shizu and we get nothing...its our own du,b fault
<Meanwhile> Or it's her fault for throwing a hissy fit about it.
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: This channel has been host to whether toilet paper should face the wall or the toilet. I don't think you can expect meaningful conversations all the time, some of it is going to be silly.
<BladedWings|HW> *dumb
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kammerjunk, wait wat?
<Shizuka> 13When the outbound packets are note perfect, it is not a problem on my end.
<Kammerjunk> ASoftFluffyThing: Yup.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: REALLY?! :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kammerjunk: Okay then?
<Pinkielover123> xD
<Meanwhile> So it's mips? We've had that problem before. What's wrong with fixing it the same way?
<Kammerjunk> It was a strange discussion, but I believe the final result was that the end of the roll should face the toilet.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: that's what we're saying here, mips is failing. if you dont ahve another embed you could use, just say so
*ASoftFluffyThing ponders her life
<Shizuka> 13We have dozens.
<Shizuka> 13I don't feel like continuing.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: why not?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Yeah I need to get out more. Damn you age limit!
<Kammerjunk> Well, that's another matter then.
<Meanwhile> Because she's moping.
<Meanwhile> Well, moving on then.
<Pinkielover123> I'm bored/
<Pinkielover123> .*
<Meanwhile> Anyone seen any good movies lately?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Most of the places here are bars because I live in a college town/city
<ASoftFluffyThing> Since USC owns just about ALL of downtown
<BladedWings|HW> Meanwhile: i think the last thing i saw was That's My Boy and that was pretty funny
<Kammerjunk> Most of the places here are boring because I live in a boring city.
<Meanwhile> BladedWings|HW: Never heard of it, what's it about?
<Dken2021> anyone seen this movie yet? http://derpy.me/KFuWS
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dken2021 OH LORD GAWD NO
<Meanwhile> Smiley, that's the one with Shane Dawson isn't it?
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: Didn't even know it was out yet.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Yeah, it's the YouTube celebrity film.
<Dken2021> oh it's not out yet? ah, thought it was
<Kammerjunk> With Shane Dawson and Toby Turner.
<BladedWings|HW> Meanwhile: Adam Sandler as a kid has sex with his teacher, they have a kid...the kid at a certain age decides to leave his family and change his name cause he is embarrass by the dad
<Meanwhile> Well on the one hand I question any film using youtube 'celebs' but on the other it actually looks sort of interesting.
<Dken2021> oh, looks like it'll be out next week
<MadSurge> Dken2021: I think that if the face was completely blank it would have been scarier :D
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: It quite possibly features Shane Dawson dying.
<Kammerjunk> I sure hope so.
<Meanwhile> BladedWings|HW: Sounds...odd.
<BladedWings|HW> Meanwhile: the rest of the moive is them trying to work things out and be a family again
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: True that could be a plus.
<MadSurge> Let's watch bad movies! :D
<BladedWings|HW> Dken2021: i might wanna see that
<MadSurge> Let's watch North!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shane Dawson. Eh.
<Meanwhile> BladedWings|HW: what genre is it?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Refresh embed everypony :)
<Dken2021> oh god, the premise sounds silly. He can be summoned from the internet XD
<BladedWings|HW> Meanwhile: comedy duh
<Kammerjunk> Suddenly, LimeV.
<Meanwhile> BladedWings|HW: Don't "duh" me, that doesn't sound very comedic.
<CCCP> Bey everypony
<BladedWings|HW> bye CCCP
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Later CCCP :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile, hahahalol
<Dken2021> seeya CCCP
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye CCCP
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: Do svidaniya.
<Meanwhile> Oh, we've got something now.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: It may not sound a lot like comedy, but Adam Sandler.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Why did Nintendo make their Gamecube discs soooooo damn tiny
<Dken2021> also this is a very misleading poster http://derpy.me/KFuWS
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: How come?
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Oh he's considered funny? That'd be why I was confused.
<Dark_Horst> ASoftFluffyThing: to fit the drive
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I understand that.
<Dark_Horst> cube shape and all
<Dken2021> Kammerjunk it implies sonic has a bigger role in the movie
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: What does Sonic have to do with Smiley?
<Lil_B> hello again everyone :) I see NewSuperBronyU sis streaming
<BladedWings|HW> Meanwhile: sorry for the confusion XD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They made it smaller to combat piracy
<Dken2021> Kammerjunk no, two different films
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dken2021, a CUBE can make an awesome portable speaker. <.<
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: You just linked me to Smiley, though.
<ASoftFluffyThing> NewSuperBronyU, has that even worked?
<Meanwhile> Well, he's got a...fleshy emoticon stitched mask for a face, that's a positive sign in my opinion.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Kind of
<Dken2021> Kammerjunk oh, sorry
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: You silly filly.
<MadSurge> Dken2021: is it really goofy horror?
<Meanwhile> Thing is I'm more concerned that Smiley'll be a generic slasher.
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Meanwhile> "there is a guy with a knife, stupid teenagers die"
<Dken2021> MadSurge he can be summed from the internet
<Kammerjunk> I'm only watching it to see Shane Dawson possibly get brutally murdered.
<Dken2021> *summoned
<Dken2021> oh look, paper mario
<Meanwhile> I recall a film that summoned the evil of the moment via ringtone on a cell.
<Meanwhile> Was rather meh.
<thelonepony> hi Everypony :)
<Dken2021> hey thelonepony
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi thelonepony
<thelonepony> Is NewSuperBronyU Playing :3
<BladedWings|HW> hi thelonepony
<Dken2021> ya
<Kammerjunk> thelonepony: Salve.
<thelonepony> Salve?
<MadSurge> Salve, ciao, buongiorno thelonepony :D
<Meanwhile> Ooh, anyone seen 1408?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nope
<Kammerjunk> thelonepony: It's a Latin greeting. Bit formal, I suppose, but what the heck.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: the cursed room movie?
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: aye that's the one.
<Meanwhile> One of my favourites.
<Invi> hai thelonepony ^^
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: seen it!
<Dken2021> anyways, this was what I was talking about being misleading, ralph isn't even in the poster http://derpy.me/4Xd-t
<alexxm> how are things thelonepony
<Dark_Horst> ....is that mario with round based rpg combat system?
<Dark_Horst> wat?
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: You must not have seen the other posters.
<Sylandest> stream!
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: Oh, that one. I'll be excited to watch that one when I can finally download a 720p/1080p version of it.
<thelonepony> hi Invi MadSurge Kammerjunk ASoftFluffyThing Dken2021 alexxm :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dark_Horst: You never played Paper Mario before? o.o
<MadSurge> Dken2021: I see the Samus expy :$
<thelonepony> Doing Great alexxm and You?
<Invi> Dark_Horst, shame on you
<Dark_Horst> NewSuperBronyU: i dont have consoled
<Kammerjunk> I'm not even a particularly big Nintendo fan, and I've still played Paper Mario.
<Dark_Horst> *consoles
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Or rather Super Mario RPG ><
<Dken2021> Meanwhile oh, my mistake then
<Dark_Horst> yeah well, no consoles
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Best part is that bit in the vents.
<Kammerjunk> Ooh, Wreck-It Ralph has John Reilly as lead voice.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Kammerjunk: Brule's Rules :P
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I liked when the room faked him out being outside again
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Troll room is best room.
<MadSurge> TROLL COLUMNS
<Invi> hehe dat pow block
<Meanwhile> So is the plot of this that Bowser has kidnapped the princess?
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Are you some sort of sorcerer?
<Kammerjunk> Mage, perhaps? Surely you have the ability to scry.
<MadSurge> Played the first Paper Mario, still haven't got to the ice fortress boss
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Well let's face it, noughts and crosses are harder to figure out than the plot of a Mario game.
<Invi> MadSurge, I found that cloud monster harder ^^
<Kammerjunk> I never did figure out the plot of noughts and crosses.
<MadSurge> Invi: I didn't even reach it, I mean :D
<Invi> MadSurge, oh ok ^^
<Invi> Bowser's battle was epic .__.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :) just got Rayman,ah i remember this Paper Mario & the 1000 yr door :O such a good game!
<BladedWings|HW> hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Invi> hai Sketch_Toku_Brony ^^
<thelonepony> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :3
<Wirisme> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Wirisme> and Rayman, nice
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: let's just say that later the plot becomes a little different from "Bowser kidnaps the Princess" :D
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Which Rayman game? o.o
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Really? Does someone else kidnap her instead?
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Peach kidnapped Bowser?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> NewSuperBronyU: Origins in Vita
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Actually, Bowser hasn't kidnapped the princess at all yet. She's just out looking for the treasure.
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<MadSurge> :D
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Sketch_Toku_Brony: Awesome :D I love that game ;A;
<Serenity> And suddenly, Thousand year door
<BladedWings|HW> hi Serenity
<thelonepony> hi Serenity :)
<Kammerjunk> Was Mario peeing in the bushes therE?
<Kammerjunk> there*
<Meanwhile> Oh so Bowser hasn't kidnapped her /yet/
<MadSurge> :D
<Meanwhile> But...he does.
<MadSurge> THOSE THINGS' FACES
<Meanwhile> So basically it's "Mario faffing around for a bit before the thing you knew was coming happens"
<Serenity> Hahaha
<Serenity> Poison
<Serenity> Oh.
<Serenity> :L
<Meanwhile> Well props for at least adding to the basic story outline.
<MadSurge> BOOOOOO
<Invi> trololol
<Sonny> °w° hello everpony...
<Wirisme> Hi Sonny
<Kammerjunk> Heus, Sonny.
<Sonny> yay responds! :)
<Meanwhile> 'Lo Sonny.
<Invi> hay Sonny and NewSuperBronyU what are you doing behind that bush....? >.>
<Kammerjunk> Consarnit, Mario, could you hold it for 5 minutes.
<thelonepony> hi Sonny
<Meanwhile> Invi: Something involving that female Goomba probably. Best left unsaid.
<Serenity> Mario has a busy timeline
<Invi> NewSuperBronyU, dat poor bush! :<
<BladedWings|HW> hi Sonny
<Serenity> Never any time to go for a piss
<Sonny> I think I just revived the chat and nothing much Invi >_>
<Barbetos> Faffing is an awesome word. lol
<Serenity> Yeah, a British word :]
<Meanwhile> Super stop pounding the Goomba in the bush and get back to playing. :P
<Kammerjunk> Barbetos: It is.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I thought the way that bush was shaking looked suspicious.
<Sonny> I am actually searching got someone that had the name The_engineer, 2 days ago, on this site
<Sonny> Can asomepony help me :D?
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: these games are made by the same team that makes the Fire Emblem games, so they made RPGs with Mario rather than the other way around
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Meanwhile: Moo ><
<Sonny> nobody seen him or anything D:?
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: Are you sure he didn't erect a teleporter and got out of here?
<Barbetos> NewSuperBronyU There is a female goomba following you. KILITKILITKILITKILITKILITKILITKILIT
<Sonny> Kammerjunk: well the thing is I drew him a picture and now he isn't on to see it <_<
<Sonny> so, yeah
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Barbetos: o u
<Sonny> kinda, waste of time then >_>
<Serenity> Grr, my internet is being shitagain
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: Well, ain't that a kick in the head.
<Sonny> Kammerjunk: exactly :/
<Barbetos> No really kill it before anyone else sees it. That is not canon!
<BladedWings|Dishes> brb guys, gonna go wash some dishes
<Dark92Enigma> No stream here

<Barbetos> You are missing out on some serious paper mario action.
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: The_Engineer was idpmdhilcd@2.49.khg.wnh and last logged in about 7 hours ago. Try tomorrow, a bit earlier.
<BladedWings|Dishes> Dark92Enigma: there is a stream
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU Do I have to Press Play ... on Tape ?
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: Or a lot later, whichever.

<MadSurge> :O THWOMP BOSS
<Barbetos> Press Start Lil_B
<Barbetos> Then Select
<Dark92Enigma> BladedWings|Dishes: my stream doesn't say so, it says ''we are doing maintenance''
<Meanwhile> Shhwonk.
<Sonny> Kammerjunk: uhm, you seem to have talked to him
<Kammerjunk> Shhwonk is clearly the sound that makes.
<BladedWings|Dishes> Dark92Enigma: odd...refresh?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark92Enigma you're dooomed to see that screen for a few months
<MadSurge> :D
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: No, I just did a /whowas
<MadSurge> QUIZ SHOW
<Sonny> Kammerjunk: oh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i know cause i had it
<Dark92Enigma> So i'll be off for a while until it comes back
<Barbetos> No! Lil_B I figured it out. Press Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start.
<Meanwhile> Well that was unexpected.
<Invi> wait, wat?
<Sonny> Kammerjunk: damnit xD he said he didn't have a deviantart so it's gonna be hard to tell him then >.>
<Lil_B> Barbetos I think it was Left, left/down, down and heavy Punch ...
<Barbetos> Sorry I don't play rap games.
<Lil_B> Barbetos that was Streat Fighter 2 :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh limeV pulling out support of countries as random without saying anything to anyone
<ekips> Let's play a game of rap
<Invi> a rap game?
<Meanwhile> Chat rap battle.
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: I think it was up up down down left right left right B A START.
<Meanwhile> I thought LimeV always goofed for you.
<Lil_B> Kammerjunk too bad you were playing Gradius III
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it came back like a month ago
<Sonny> oh Kammerjunk would you like to see what I drew for him :D?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait. I just realised that joke was just made.
<Kammerjunk> I am so slow.
<Meanwhile> Ah. That blows.
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Never heard of it.
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: Sure.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Rap battle? I liked the Gandalf vs Dumbledore one
<Sonny> http://masdragonflare.deviantart.com/#/d5gqgzo
<Sonny> here it is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> now i just think they put/remove support at random becuase their servers can't handle it
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Wait, that's a lie. Rings a bell.
<MadSurge> FUZZIES
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Don't think I ever played a lot of it, but certainly rings a bell.
<Kimori> ello
<Lil_B> Kammerjunk Gradius, well knows shmup from Konami :)
<Sonny> oh god, i keep forgetting
<Sonny> no links while stream D:
<Meanwhile> Mayhaps. Do they have anything useful in the manner of support?
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: Oh, picture links are fine.
<thelonepony> No VIDEO Links Sonny
<Sonny> oh really?
<MadSurge> YAAAAAAAY
<Kammerjunk> THIS CHAT IS DEAD.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope send them a message they never respond
<Meanwhile> Specifically, no non-image links while a stream is playing.
<Sonny> nononono thelonepony it's a pic
<Sonny> it's a pic
<Sonny> no worries :D
<Sonny> i think
<Sonny> and hope >_>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my best shot was finding the url to the direct stream and watch it on their site
<Kammerjunk> Sonny: As per usual, I am saddened by my absolute disablity of drawing ponies. But I like it.
<thelonepony> :D
<thelonepony> I always Mess up
<thelonepony> :d
<Kammerjunk> I blame the chests.
<Lil_B> Sonny sometimes it reeally depends on the mod atm, some say "No Links During Streams" most say "only pictures during streams" others say "anything BUT Video Links during streams"
<Meanwhile> Helpful bunch. :/
<Kammerjunk> And ATM, it's SB. He's just a silly filly, so no problems thar.
<Sonny> Kammerjunk: ye don't worry it's not like I couldn't do any better it's just a quick pic to show what I could do, but ye he logged out
<Sonny> :/
<Lil_B> yes :)
<Sonny> and I get it Lil_B thanks :D
<MadSurge> For those that don't get it: you can prevent your party from getting some damage by pressing a button at the same moment you get damaged.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i liek silleh \:3/
<Kammerjunk> Wait, SB can't be a silly filly. Crazy colt?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<Sonny> NewSuperBronyU: I like silleh 2 :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I am silleh ;^;
<MadSurge> Fuzzies' timing is particularly tricky
<Kammerjunk> Okay, you're silly D:

<Sonny> wait what's glomping :o?

<Pink3> HEY I have a brony-to brony question to ask you,my friend is coming over tommorow,one time on MC i had a pony shirt and he said "Why do you have a pony shirt" and i said Cause its funny ( a stupid excuse) and he said it mAKes me look gay. He Does not know about bronys,but implies they are gay. Since then i have really grown on the fanbase and have pony stuff on my XBOX,desktop and even around my room it is so much im too lazy to remove
<Stallion_of_War> Leave it
<Meanwhile> Suddenly block of text.
<Stallion_of_War> They can deal
<Wirisme> idk
<Stallion_of_War> and if they don't, stab them with something
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Stallion_of_War> I suggest BLADES OF CHAOS
<Kammerjunk> Preferably sharp.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh god dang
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kammerjunk, why not a rusty knife
<Meanwhile> Or for actually useful advice...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Super Mario Thousand year door
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Pink3: I'd tell your friend to grow up.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Paper Mario even
<CrimsonPhoenix> derp
<Kammerjunk> ASoftFluffyThing: You make a good point.
<Pink3> Stallion_of_War: Im not stabbing him he is one of my best friends T_T
<Meanwhile> Yeah that works.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Pink3 say it's your sister room or tell him you're a brony and deal with it
<Kammerjunk> Pink3: Stab him!
<Kammerjunk> DO it
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: OH U
<ekips> the music in this game is catchy..
<twilight_sprinkle> Pink3: well, you can always beat him with something
<Kammerjunk> That's also an option.
<Stallion_of_War> Sorry... useful advice: Leave it and let them deal with it
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pink3, well tell him that it does look gay because gay means happy.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Pink3, deflect insult!
<BladedWings|Dishes> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Pink3: tell him youre gay
<Meanwhile> Use mantis kung fu!
<Pink3> NewSuperBronyU: hmmmmm maybe and TheGreatAndPowerfulT I dont have a sis
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: *slow clap*
<Stallion_of_War> http://twentypercentcooler.net/data/aa/1a/aa1a479706edf9b7af1d4dbb1a8ff4f8.gif?1316310493
<Pink3> Shut UP twilight_sprinkle
<CrimsonPhoenix> Am I really coming in here in the middle of a drama?
<twilight_sprinkle> Pink3: but srsly, if hes your friend, he should be able to deal with it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Pink3 then deal with it that's you only option
<Pink3> Ok
<Meanwhile> Well you know, either tell him you like it and roll with it, or hide it suavely.
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, I did good?
<Stallion_of_War> Pink3: Before he arrives, put sunglasses in your pocket (preferrably similar to the ones Discord owns), and if he says anything, pull them out, put them on, and say deal with it.
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: yes. oh my god you did well. :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, deflect insult, gain awesome points
*Stallion_of_War Uses humor to diffuse the situation.

<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a bit annoying
<puffmuffins> no
<Pink3> eeyup
<Stallion_of_War> If there's one thing Ares taught me, it's that stabbing things that make you angry is a good thing
<ekips> not getting any lag atm
<Stallion_of_War> or stabbing things that annoy you
<puffmuffins> its very annoying
<Stallion_of_War> or stabbing basically anything
