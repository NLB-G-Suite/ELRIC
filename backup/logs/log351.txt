<Midnight_Fire> Sure thing, Scoots
<Moonlight> 45,000
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I know dat feel, Meanwhile
<SayWhat> but i said 20% more than over 9000
<Rainbow_Assassin> YAY
<Cypresswolf> Pokemon series has the absolute weirdest timeline Ive ever seen. It started out with Prof Oak sending Ash & Gary to go discover new pokemon, then all of a sudden several new pokemon and a new region is discovered and populated overnight. Then in all the flashbacks to ancient times, all current pokemon existed then, that season 1 Kanto had no idea about? O_o
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm calling you Alex from now on.
<ScootaChicken> no problem Alejandro
<LadyCanary> ...Holy crap you're right. o_o But I didnt formally introduce myself because I was shy SaxyPretender ^^"
<Rainbow_Assassin> YEAH
<SayWhat> Therefore, the minumim would be 9180, there is no cap
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03RAWRity >: (
<ScootaChicken> ain't I a stinker...
<Cypresswolf> Am I right?
<Midnight_Tempest> one day i will travel the world and meet as many bronies as possible... top of the list is all the mods of bronystate
<bear2229> i just mean in general
<Meanwhile> LadyCanary: so shy you refuse to share your name with the group.
<JTDrift> I wish I knew you people IRL so I can take you lunch money
<Moonlight> ok
<mario_pony> yes he does when u use thunder stone
<SayWhat> x > 9179
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: it's simple: the makers of Pokemon hadn't thought of all that yet.
<Meanwhile> If I knew you people irl I'd have an excuse to leave my house.
<TopHat> Cypresswolf: maybe they're hundreds of years apart like zelda?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I think I met Flaire IRL during Bronycon!
<Jokuc> I don't know. I would guess 800,000 or something
<Queen_Rarity> GARY MOTHERFUCKING OAK!!!!! :[:[:[
<Meanwhile> Sadly though, I don't. And I remain a cave dwelling troglodite.
<TopHat> wait no...
<Rainbow_Assassin> no
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I've met a lot of people during Bronycon...
<ScootaChicken> I won't tell you guys my first name (mostly because about half of you already know it) but I will tell you that one of my middle names is 'Woodchurch'
<ScootaChicken> like a baws.
<LadyCanary> ....Wat.
<MahBoi777> hai Tophat
<SayWhat> so what is 6-6x6?
<Jokuc> Why couldn't that be possible
<TopHat> helloooooooo
<RAWRity> think of each new Generation as a big ol' Retcon for the series.
<Cypresswolf> Maybe...Then Ash has the best aging luck ever!
<Moonlight> I think ther eare more than 800,000 bronies in the world
<MasterBrony> hay everypony!!!!
<ScootaChicken> ohai TopHat
<Midnight_Fire> Intersting name, ScootaChicken
<bear2229> hi
<MasterBrony> THE GAME!!!!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3during off times we're a little more lenient on the on-topic rule, but you still have to follow the no r34/gore/pg-13 rules
<JTDrift> Alejandro Woodchurch? sounds cool
<Jokuc> 6-6x6=30
<Midnight_Tempest> Scoota 'Woodchurch' Chicken
<Jokuc> Yeah you're probably right
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03ScootaChicken: Is it Neil?
<mario_pony> my name is george or jorge or georgeneightor
<bear2229> yeah i know
<TopHat> Scotty doesn't know! Scotty doesn't know! Scotty doesn't know! Scotty doesn't know!
<String_Shredder> Scoota Woodchurch Chicken? silly british names
<Queen_Rarity> 1st gen is best gen
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03inb4 Alejandro Neil
<Meanwhile> Sounds like a title for a hitman.
<ScootaChicken> Scoot-Scootaloo: HOWEVER DID YOU KNOW?
<Cypresswolf> Does Ash ever beat the elite 4 in the series?
<Rainbow_Assassin> I hope so
<ScootaChicken> inb4 skype
<SayWhat> wrong
<Conyst> If that's true Ash is over a thousand years old
<Rainbow_Assassin> what
<Meanwhile> Wouldn't be the weirdest thing in Pokemon.
<Midnight_Tempest> inb4 self-destru*explodes*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Part of having Gardevoir colors means that I am a psychic type!
<SayWhat> it's -30
<Cypresswolf> Or are the creators saving that for the end of the series? Probably that...
<BronyKing> has sadly seen all the pokemon eps
<Meanwhile> Also that you're a crossdresser Scoot-Scootaloo
<Conyst> True
<Tovler> oh crap. I'm missing a pokemon anime discussion.
<Rainbow_Assassin> Ooooo
<Rainbow_Assassin> soooo
<Queen_Rarity> Pokemon diead when 2nd gen was over
<Jokuc> Yeah I forgot the -
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...man, the more I hear SCV music, the more I want to shell out $86 to import the LE OST from Japan
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03....maybe....
<CosmicLatte> ...
<Tovler> And I've also seen all the episodes and almost all of the movies.
<CosmicLatte> MasterBrony.
<pony_7960> 3rd gen episodes were actually the best imo
<Meanwhile> Take pics Scoot-Scootaloo.
<MasterBrony> yeeeeeeessss>
<MasterBrony> ?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I loved pokemon 2000!
<RAWRity> we need a Dark Type mod to meddle with Scoot-Scootaloo
<CosmicLatte> Despite the fact that you oh-so-kindly carry me.
<CosmicLatte> I hate you.
<Queen_Rarity> The thrashbag is a nice tuch
<CosmicLatte> >:(
<MasterBrony> why?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Scoot-Scootaloo /)
*Shizuka 13meddles with Scoot-Scootaloo
<CosmicLatte> YOU MADE ME LOSE THE GAME.
<MasterBrony> what did i do/notdo?
<BronyKing> needs a new pokemon cartoon
<mario_pony> i wonder what happens to all his pokemon he catches like a thousand then in the next season he starts all over
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:D:d
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, since I have grey, does that make me a dark-type?
<MasterBrony> LOL
<String_Shredder> i caught all 151 pokemans!
<Rainbow_Assassin> The?
<Meanwhile> I can't even remember pokemon past series 1 and the gold game.
<Midnight_Tempest> Lugia is awesome pokemon
<Tovler> I'd say this current season of pokemon is the best, although that's not saying much.
<CosmicLatte> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywiovudwsfA
<Shizuka> 13meddle meddle meddle
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No, that makes you Aggron, Saxy
<MasterBrony> dont make me drop you in the parasprite pit
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<Queen_Rarity> I'm thinking gray is ghost or steel
<CosmicLatte> T_T
<CosmicLatte> *clutches* DON'T
<CosmicLatte> NOT THE NAVIS
<MahBoi777> String_Shredder: Congratulations!
<Meanwhile> Lugia can piss off. I killed that douche like 80 times trying to catch him.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey
<Rainbow_Assassin> the -
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey
<ScootaChicken> back in ye olde days, and by that I mean about a year ago, I caught all the pokemans in my copy of Yellow
<Cypresswolf> Game wise, I like the evolution of graphic the pokemon series has. from black & white to monochrome, to full on 3D
<ScootaChicken> and it was good.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14No one insults Lugia on my watch.
<Conyst> Professor Oak has a really big ranch. It's the only way
<MasterBrony> hehehe
<RAWRity> What I really wish the Pokemon Anime would have done is to start of each new Region with a new protagonist, like the games and Manga. That way we don't have to constantly keep Ash and the others from developing.
<Midnight_Tempest> you tell him Saxy
<MasterBrony> still hate me?
<Queen_Rarity> LUGIA HAS THE BEST SONG
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Lets name mods after pokemon!
*Meanwhile tears off his shirt. "Come at me bro"
<Midnight_Tempest> Lugia is best pokemon
<Midnight_Fire> For some reason I just listened to the entirety of thagt Vivaldi song that was posted ten minutes ago

<ScootaChicken> SlurryMoon is Solrok
<RAWRity> prince-dari: is Vaniliuxe :p
<SayWhat> They call it an xbox 360 because when you look at it you turn 360 degrees and walk away
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: NO
<TopHat> TopHat is a/an Deoxys
<mario_pony> @Pony
<SlurryMoon> 3what?

<BronyKing> we need a pokemon show for the adult veiwers
<Midnight_Tempest> whoever the top mod is, they get to be Arceus
<Queen_Rarity> Sax is that little steel pig
<SlurryMoon> 3Wait, why can't I be Lunatone?
<CosmicLatte> *twitch*
<Cypresswolf> One of those generations...maybe 3 hints at a device for understanding what the pokemon are trying to say. I'd love to see that in game
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sumica is more of a Marril
<LadyCanary> Why not Agron, Scoot-Scootaloo?
<SuperBrony64|FOOD> 10,02What is this place, I don't even...
<RAWRity> Sumica: youre a Poison type that looks like a pile of garbage, apparently.
<ScootaChicken> and then SlurryMoon was Lunatone

<SayWhat> This is true
<Queen_Rarity> L stands for Dewgong
<TopHat> My theory: The pokemon games happen in reverse order, 150 or so pokemon go extict between everygame. (Probably due to the fact that humans are extraterestrials and brought foreign viruses that could kill off all the pokemon in 15 years)
<MahBoi777> ludicrous

*TOY_PON3|Fancy once again strolls in with TopHat on, monocle, and cane

<The_4th_Wall> Night
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> I am Fancy once more ಠ_ರೃ
<emangamer> mah that's not a sterio type AT ALL
<Moop> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-forever-a-postman.png
<Cipher> 0,14Give them what for, buddy.
<emangamer> TOY_PON3|Fancy: with great fancy, comes great money...and with that comes FREE POLITICS
<RAWRity> emangamer: I'm not talking about people making unhealthy stuff for money. I'm talking about somebody going to the trouble of MAKING that damn thing, just because they wanted to say they could, or worse, actually thought it would be a good idea. When we've reached that point as a species, I don't think there's a way to recover from that.
<Shizustream> oops, hull integrity 69%
<Midnight_Tempest> tl;dr
<BronyCon> WOOOO
<Shizustream> ramming speed... bad idea when no forward shields
<MahBoi777> Cake!
<Placebo> NEEEERRRRDSS
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> Free ponies for every European, Asian, African, and American
<RAWRity> This is like the KFC Double Down, but...somehow so much worse.
<kyle0113> Do you have Xbox?
<Cipher> 0,14At least you have shields, F15s don't have that luxury.
<MahBoi777> we need sum chicken!
<emangamer> RAWRity: I dont see how THAT is a problem. that's like shaming someone for making a 7 layered cake. Nothing wrong with it, as long as you eat in in moderation.
<Midnight_Tempest> free ponies... FOR THE WORLD!!
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> ^
<kyle0113> The first one
<Jim> I support free ponies
<Moop> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ponies-react-to-teens.png
<MahBoi777> Vermin Supreme!:D
<NullRadix> also: I can eat a sandwich and a banana for about 75 cents. McD's doesn't beat that

<Moop> My dad went to VERMIN SUPREMES HOUSE!!!
<emangamer> TopHat doesn't know how to triforce
<TopHat> that was difficult to make
*TOY_PON3|Fancy removes TopHat and puts on Boot
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> ;)
<RAWRity> emangamer: because cake actually has some connection to actual food. That things is just ground up bone marrow and preservatives, waiting to shove its gummy tendrils into your arteries and strangling you from the inside out.
<Heimerdinger> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-pikachu-vs-ponies.jpg
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3|Fancy aquired boot!
*Midnight_Tempest takes ALL the fancy in the chat
<emangamer> RAWRity: according to that logic you could say that about a SINGLE gusher
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> I had to trade it for a TopHat
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> :)
<Moop> I bet no one else is that cool
<Kimori> yeah I do
<MahBoi777> fancy boots
<emangamer> Guys please try to slow down with the Links. One or two is alright but this is getting a little out of hand.
<emangamer> inb4 chat is ded
<MahBoi777> post all the links! *troll face*
<Kimori> why do you ask?
<LadyBlackhawk> Nope.
<Midnight_Tempest> inb4 RAMMING SPEED!!
<Jim> Colossus, that sounds safe
*emantrollslayer] slays MahBoi777
<RAWRity> emangamer: yes, I could. and then this person decided to take that gusher and increase it exponentially. It's Gusher^10 if you will.
<kyle0113> Well if you want I have San Andreas...the best one in my opinion for that :) sometime I could maybe send it to you if you want. I trust you lol
<Moop> osting link was my only way to get attention :'(
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> dat emantrollslayer
<kyle0113> I just dont see a need in buying something you might not like
*MahBoi777 uses finger to stop sword
<Heimerdinger> Gusher to the power of 10 is greater than or equal to a singe fruit rollup
<Phase4> osting?
<Kimori> oh, thats real nice of you
<Jim> mfw that means cheesing in my language
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: I'm confused. What is it you have the problem with? The food with which it was constructed, or the sheer fact that it was constructed at all.
<Kimori> no worries though, I probably wont be playing it :P
<RaveBrony> Wow, took me Forever to realize my chat screen had died -_-
<mario_pony> i was in a chatroom with but forest-fire but i left how can i find it
<Moop> posting links was my only way to get attention :'(
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: it's mroe the fact that somebody's more than willing to eat that.
<Phase4> RaveBrony: its taken me hours sometimes
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> Moop: Not true.
<Jim> Ponies: There is no escape
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> Just spam :P
<Midnight_Tempest> RAMMING SPEED!!!!
<Shizustream> RAMMING SPEED
<emantrollslayer> Moop: try to say somethign actually funny or intellectual instead of resorting to someone else to do it for you. Or just write excessive amounts of text like I do. that way everypony has no hope to NOT see it
<RawketLawnchair> You fool!
<TopHat> Phase4: what do I put in my URL to autojoin a room
<RaveBrony> Lol, I was just...waiting for someone to say something then said something and it did pop up xD
<King> hello
<Cipher> 0,14Ugh, foolish ideals.
<NullRadix> RAWRity: it tastes good. we are told by a 'reputable source' (often parents) it is acceptable. Until we are told otherwise, why would you suspect?
<bear2229> JUST SHOOT THE ARROWS
<kyle0113> Haha kk
<RaveBrony> *then I said something
<RAWRity> That thing should trigger your self preservation instincts, and have your arm involuntarilly hurling it away as fast as possible as your brain shouts "WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY LIFE?" at you.
<Midnight_Tempest> forward decks 400 through 1200... damn....
<Placebo> Either they are REALY far away, or those ships are moving at the speed of smell..
<MahBoi777> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: I would eat it. It just LOOKS and probably tastes good as well. Like I said, nothing wrong with eating it, just so long as you dont eat anything else for the next 3 weeks
<GabeMoist> You know what would go great with this game?
<RaveBrony> What are disputing about atm? O.o
<Cipher> 0,14What, GabeMoist?
<GabeMoist> The Infinity Engine
<SayWhat> Chips
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: actually the self-preservation instinct is to eat as much as possible so that you can survive.
<RawketLawnchair> It takes quite a lot ofenergy to move thoseships, Placebo
<MahBoi777> a cheeseburger?
<Shizustream> moar medals! <3
<Phase4> TopHat: need to modify the site to do that, but for a stand alone page with the chat in it this is the url ponychat.net/webchat/?config=bronystate&autojoin=%23bronystate,%23Twilight_Sparkle
<Shizustream> ^-^~
<RAWRity> It seems like eating that things is something you need to take a shower afterwards.
<RawketLawnchair> Also, yay, Pegasi medal.
<Moop> * lolololollolol something funny something hilarious meme joke *insert here* hidden MLP reference.
<Midnight_Tempest> GO SHIZU!!
<NullRadix> oh wait, was the discussion about the SPECIFIC mass of junk, or the stuff it was made up of in general

<SayWhat> RAWRity: I could see it now...
<TopHat> it's not bronystate's faul
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: because AJ IS most underrated Pony
<TopHat> t

<TOY_PON3> Shizustream: You did great job
<TOY_PON3> ;)
<GabeMoist> mine is better
<TheDr> and #1 is TRIXIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<RAWRity> Personally, I like Aj's character. She's not a pony that is made to jump out at the screen to try and grab attention. She's the "Straight man" to everypony else's crazy antics, and I like that.
<TheDr> :)
<MahBoi777> Jim IS John Madden
<SayWhat> Spike is best
<LordCelestia> 0,5Shizustream, where is your %?
<TheDr> spike is best dragon
<Shizustream> this is my laptop
<MahBoi777> SayWhat: LOL
<RaveBrony> However, I dont have a favorite pony.... I love every one of them equally xD
<LordCelestia> 0,5Put your % on THIS INSTANT young lady. Youre exposed!
<Placebo> The shame!
<Shizustream> .-.
<Shizustream> but i do...
<Shizustream> Shizuka: see?

<Cipher> 0,14it's Freespace 2, Spamcannon
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh so NOW youre multiplying
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: and while that may appeal to some, I think most are looking for fantasy amd magic
<SayWhat> Because i think i can do that
<MahBoi777> spaaaaaaaaaace
<RaveBrony> ^
<SayWhat> Dad, are you in space?
<Jim> LC, I am just as confused as you

<MahBoi777> yes son, now we are a family again
<TheDr> trolldad in space!!
<SayWhat> Are you proud of me, dad?
*fillyfillyy 's brain explodes from cpntaining too many confusion particles
<TOY_PON3> No!
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: I think most are looking for engaging characters, and while AJ isn't necessarily the loudest of ponies, she has her own unique charm.
<TheDr> stairdad
<MahBoi777> trolololololol
*SayWhat says who
<TOY_PON3> :D
<TheDr> :)
<MahBoi777> say whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
<fillyfillyy> YOY_PON3 im not dead i just dont have a brain.
<Jim> My little Portal: Science is Magic
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: like I said, being human like is her own charm, but that is not that I, personally, am looking for
<TheDr> WAIT NO PARASPRITS!!
*GabeMoist punches the science off of Bronystate's face
<TOY_PON3> :o
<MahBoi777> My Little Portal: Friendship is a Deadly Neurotoxin
<RAWRity> She's the one there to 1: be the stable character when others lose it, and 2: drop the occasionally snark when presneted with her chance. It's an imprtant part of the group dynamic that unfortunately goes underappreciated.
<TheDr> lol
<Cipher> 0,14Y u do dat, GabeMoist?
<SayWhat> http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/747017_o.gif SAY WHAAAA
<RaveBrony> I like every one of the ponies personalities. O.o I cant even imagine how Anypony can choose a 'best' xD
<MahBoi777> :D
<TheDr> i love them all
<Jim> Nonono man, you're making me fall asleep.
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony is best pony ;)
<TheDr> WAKE UP
<RaveBrony> Lol xD
<RAWRity> After all, if you didn't have at least one member of the group who was in the right mind most of the time, they'd never get anything done.
<SayWhat> Happy Kitty, Sleepy kitty, little ball of furr; Warm kitty, soft kitty, purr purr purrrrr
<RaveBrony> TOY_PON3 is obviously best pony! xD
<GabeMoist> Cipher, because I love wife like sun raise, dark man you will suffar
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: that is true. But as I said, whe is overshadowed by magic, flying, extream cuteness, breaking the 4th wall, and umm....fabulosity? and as I have said they are more desierable to most people.
<Phase4> i'ma try again to upload my video, brb
<TopHat> I choose Twi because she's the sexiest

<SayWhat> Two years ago, back in 2012, I watched the 3rd season of MlP. What did you guys think of it?
<MahBoi777> GabeMoist: just Gabe Newell!
<LadyBlackhawk> Ah there we go.
<TopHat> SayWhat: It was alright
<RaveBrony> Lol xD
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: not at all. he's the one approaching things from a logicl standpoint, where as the Blood Gulch crew takes whatever insanity and just roles with it.
<Cipher> 0,14Ghost Eye is best AWACS.
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: the closest thing to the staright man in RvB is either Griff or Doc, that show doesn't have straight men.

<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: while that is true, he goes to such far lengths to acomplish his mission, just look at when he destroyed South's body.
<SayWhat> <--- Mind has been BLOWN
<Yellowquiet> hi everypony
<RaveBrony> LolxD
<SayWhat> Hi
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: nah, Griff is the most self-aware of the BG guys, and Doc mostly just seems so disconected from the weird shit that he's just accepting of everything that happens. Wash is the one that is constantly saying "Wait. What the fuck just happened?"
<MahBoi777> hi Yellowquiet
<Yellowquiet> what game is that ?
<RaveBrony> Dat text wall ._.
<Cipher> 0,14Freespace 2

<TOY_PON3> dat silliness
*RaveBrony 's eyelids begin to slowly descend
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: still while he may have the most human like emotions, under no circumstances would I call him the "straight man" ACTUALLY the only one I could call that is York.

<TheDr> lol!!
<RaveBrony> xD
<RAWRity> emantrollslayer: nah, York's the snarky guy who takes things as they come with a sarcastic line and a bit of befuddlement. Wash is the serious foil to the BG guys' inanity.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"Ohhhh....Mamma...."
<SayWhat> I thoght MlP was better than Futurama and we discussed this already
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: or hell Tex is more humane than Wash
<MahBoi777> SayWhat: they're both good
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: isn't that what ANY human would so? that's what I would anyway
<SayWhat> MahBoi777: This is true
<RAWRity> Tex played that role in the early seasons, but by S5 she was very accepting of the nonsense.
<SayWhat> Say the word... What
<RaveBrony> Well I'm going to head out too everypony!! You all take care and have fun! Ill be back tomorrow :)

<MahBoi777> bye RaveBrony!
<TheDr> good bye
*RaveBrony waves bye to everypony! :$
<TheDr> 'ravebrony
<RAWRity> and "Straight Man" doesn't equate to the most human/realistic. It just means the character who isn't enclined to wackiness, and instead is meant to be a character for the craziness of others' to bounch off of.
*MahBoi777 waves back
<emantrollslayer> RAWRity: and how does that not equal york?
<MahBoi777> Sheila! come back! I made you muffins!
<TheDr> muffins can i haz some
<emantrollslayer> MahBoi777: no, caboose =/= derpy
*MahBoi777 gives TheDr some muffinz
<RAWRity> York doesn't have much time to really deal with any out-and-out craziness. Just the quirkiness of Delta, and the intense seriousness of the Freelancers. While he might have served as the Straight Man were he to meet the wackier characters, he never played that part in the group dynamic.
<TheDr> YESSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
