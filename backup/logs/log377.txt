<Jim> Bye Pon_Jovi232
<emangamer> Jim: worst card ever
<emangamer> completly unplayable in standard
<fluttershyfan158> wtf
<trollestia> Is it true that wow is loosing players because of rift and star war:the old republic?
<fluttershyfan158> TWILIGHT!!
<MidnightFire> Jim :D
<emangamer> its not even powerful enough to see play in vintage
<Jim> I haven't played magic the gathering
<emangamer> seriously, compare this to tarmogoyf and goyf wins straight out
<fluttershyfan158> HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
<CountDoofus> well guys and gals, I just managed to draw a pony without using any kind of references... what do you think?
<CountDoofus> http://countdoofus.deviantart.com/#/d4q9fci
<trollestia> twlight is a mouth?
<CriticKitten> trollestia: Only to a limited degree. TOR is basically a refined WoW, and Rift only dented WoW.
<trollestia> oh okay
<CrossChop114> Indian Stallone.
<emangamer> CountDoofus: you got the little thing on their hind legs going the reverse direction
<Jim> Pretty cool CountDoofus
<bartsonic_> twilight sparkle in wow
<fluttershyfan158> what is twilight doing there??
<MidnightFire> nice pony, CountDoofus
<RaveBrony> Nice CountDoofus :)
<emangamer> Twilight Sparkle is best Warlock
<trollestia> no, she is a mage
<trollestia> trixie is a warlock
*Jim spots the twilight walking across the screen "So awesome!"
<CriticKitten> Dat Twi. :D
<MidnightFire> Did someone say Indian Stallone? http://derpy.me/XnZZF
<Paradise92> i am bored
*String_Shredder hugs trollestia "i missed you"
<Paradise92> Entertain me!
<CountDoofus> I know, the hind legs are soemwhat off, and not very thrilled about the mane and tail too
<emangamer> trollestia: nah....trixie is a mage. So OP that everyone hates her
<CountDoofus> but other than that, I can be pretty happy about it, no?
<emangamer> CountDoofus: it still looks pretty good
<fluttershyfan158> i'm not joking what is twilight doing there???
<bartsonic> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-no-tara-oh-god-no.jpg

<Frank> ANd all DK's use the starter gear for that
<emangamer> I stopped at lvl 50 lock becasue I didnt have any friends to play with so the grinding beat me to death

<Midnight_Tempest> >_<
<KwakLad> hemorrhoids really? or is that a player name for something?

<CountDoofus> probably
<KwakLad> Oh okay Sumica would be terrible if that was the official name
<Wrek> 05its cluttered cause im runnign a lower res
<Midnight_Tempest> i despise WoW
<CrossChop114> I see.
<CriticKitten> Hm. It's a bit disappointing that you're not having to move to avoid the giant dragon's attacks....sort of detracts for me, but perhaps I'm spoiled from watching too much footage of The Shatterer. Still pretty cool.
<Sumica> 00,10less talkie more tankie
*The_4th_Wall takes the puppies out
<pony_1154> sorry guys, what game is it????? it's cool <3
<fluttershyfan158> at school yesterday i saved a fellow brony

<KwakLad> fluttershyfan158: how?
<Jim> pony_1154: This is World of Warcraft
<CrossChop114> Would your computer crash if you turned on Desktop Ponies and placed 50 of every pony?
<trollestia> how fluttershyfan?
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Sorta my point. XD
<CriticKitten> Ordinary human is able to tank against massive continent-spanning dragon. :p
<CriticKitten> Just seems weird.
<trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taqCqv6fgq4
<fluttershyfan158> he was being bullied by a non brony who was calling him gay and the kid started crying so i got up and punched the kid in the face!! i got sent to the office and i didn't get punished u know why?
<CriticKitten> I know it's pretty normal for MMOs, just seems odd in context.
<fluttershyfan158> THE PRINCEPAL WAS A BRONY TOO!!
<Sumica> 00,10well te be fair he's just attacking the toe nails as he's trying to climb out of a interdemnitonal vortex
<pony_1154> ah ok thanks
<trollestia> wow, you're awesome fluttershy the world needs more people like you.
<KwakLad> fluttershyfan158: bad that you required violence but still good you did something to stand up
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<trollestia> I haven't met a brony in my school yet.
<KwakLad> fluttershyfan158: well done none the less
<fluttershyfan158> i can only ''love and tolerate'' to a point!!
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Sure, but even the toenails are bigger than him
<CriticKitten> Also why are there tentacles?
<CriticKitten> o.o
<fluttershyfan158> now the kid is walking around with a black eye
<Sumica> 00,10shame, they called wipe it up
<KwakLad> fluttershyfan158: how un-manly will he sound when he tells his parents 'i got a black eye for saying ponies are gay'
<Sumica> 00,10and they are also being supported by the dragon aspects
<fluttershyfan158> i asked the princapal who his favorite pony is
<fluttershyfan158> he said applejack
<r41nb0wd4sh> Soarin' d00h

<TOY_PON3> hi Dashie_Dashie
<Hazard> no
<TwoFive> Hazard: I build computers. I'm not a retard who pays out the ass to have a company put together some parts in a crappy shiny case for me. Anybody who does that is a moron.
<TOY_PON3> :3
<F1uttershy> :(
<KwakLad> Hazard: DELL is computers for the masses alienware is performance gaming, they design the computers for different things
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Uh oh. Lagging.
<Hazard> true
<Hazard> but im a gamer
<Dashie_Dashie> ohai TOY_PON3

<TwoFive> Hazard: You're 12, aren't you?
<Dashie_Dashie> TOY_PON3 how does this run on your computer in comparison to TF2?
<TwoFive> KwakLad: Same here. That's the most cost-effective way to go.
<Dashie_Dashie> coz I wanna buy it ._.
<Hazard> 14 TwoFive and prefer it if you did NOT call me a retard
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie: It runs great
<KwakLad> TwoFive well said too
<Vinyl> Coach is flying?~
<The_4th_Wall> OK, seriously? too hostile in chat.
<Jim> glitched coach
<CupcakeWarrior> Isnt this game on ps3 and 360 anyways?
<Dashie_Dashie> yeah
<Dashie_Dashie> pc is better though
<TwoFive> Hazard: I call 'em like I see 'em. Lol. It's like saying macs are better because they're shiny
<F1uttershy> gorden freeman crowbar :D
<The_4th_Wall> please mellow out
<Dashie_Dashie> PC > consoles
<TwoFive> PC master race
<Hazard> Macs suck
<CupcakeWarrior> I like consoles better
<Vinyl> <3 PC
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Console fanboy here!
<Wrek> 05sigh
<TwoFive> Hazard: Okay, so you aren't entirely retarded
<xles> AMIGA WORKBENCH FOR LIFE
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Haters gon hate
<Wrek> 05for the last time macs doesnt suck
<bronyfan> XBOX FTW!
<Hazard> although beggars cant be choosers i just want my fucking PC back
<xles> wait what?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03bronyfan /)
<Dashie_Dashie> Lol Wrek, suddenly.
<Wrek> 05its all depending on what you want from your computer
<bronyfan> Thank you
<Wrek> 05stop that bloody fanboi trollin'
<TwoFive> Hazard: Build your own PC. I'm pretty sure your parents will appreciate paying less.
<KwakLad> I agree Wrek macs dont suck, the problem i have is that they are disproportionally expensive
<DashWithRainbows> Scoot-Scootaloo I used to be a console fanboy like you but then I realised that little kids are fucking annoying and trolling them gets boring.
<Hazard> dousnt sound like it will cost less
<TwoFive> Kwaklad: Agreed.
<The_4th_Wall> Xbox, but i never put forth the effort to branch out, so i don't have opinions on PS3 or PC
<CupcakeWarrior> What is so bad about consoles?
<Wrek> 05first time building comp: might be expensive casue you invest in OS n such aswell
<TwoFive> Hazard: You are approaching full retard. Seriously.
<Hazard> u cant mod
<Krakass> If apple actually does release some high dpi models I'm going to have to buy one.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yeah well, when you have a paperwieght of a laptop and a Mac, you don't have much choice...
<Wrek> 05then each time it gets cheaper and lasts longer
<KwakLad> and software
<TwoFive> Wrek: >Implying it's not easy as hell to pirate Windows 7 Ultimate
<TwoFive> Lol
<Krakass> I'm tired of being stuck with 1080P.
<CupcakeWarrior> I still think consoles are better
<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek, I've found you in the internet.. http://i.imgur.com/tfvXs.png
<KwakLad> or was software under the 'and such'?
<Hazard> TwoFive do i fucking look like i can build a PC from scratch?
<Wrek> 05TwoFive there are honest people out there, I cater to them. i know its easy as fuck to pirate.
<CountDoofus> settle down, everyone, shall we? you don't want to risk a kick or ban over a stupid dispute, do you?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03By the way, good afternoon, everypony!
<CupcakeWarrior> Id bbuild my own pc if i could
<TwoFive> Hazard: A child could do it.
<Dashie_Dashie> afternoon Scoot-Scootaloo
<MrChang> who won the lotto?
<F1uttershy> me
<CountDoofus> afternoon Scoots
<F1uttershy> i wish
<MrChang> A+B movies please
<Jim> ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
<Hazard> TwoFive with an instruction manual? if theres that i could do it
<Krakass> Building your own doesn't necessarily cost less. You can often get a comparable prebuilt computer for less simply due to economies of scale.
<Jim> Serenity and Space Mutiny, MrChang
<RAWRity> really, why mess with pirating a windows OS, when it's just as easy to get something liek Ubuntu or Mint for free?
<MrChang> damn
<MrChang> i seem to never win =\
<TwoFive> Hazard: It's simple as hell. It's like legos. It's so easy chinese laborers who are like 5 and work for FoxConn making macs can do it
<TwoFive> Hazard: You don't need a manual.
<Midnight_Tempest> cool, i liked Serenity... never heard of space mutiny though
<Jim> What were you wishing for?
<MrChang> hey now
<Krakass> I bought Win7 Pro for $30.
<MrChang> watch it, twofive
<TwoFive> Lol
<Jim> Space Mutiny's got a 1.9 on IMDB
<TwoFive> MrChang: It's true.
<Dashie_Dashie> we should watch the series Firefly this week =P
<Hazard> then how am i supposed to build it from scratch if i dont know where the right peices go? im not a god damn expert
<MrChang> its not 5
<MrChang> its at least 10
<MrChang> jeez
<Shizuka> 13keep in mind imdb scores are user generated, not critics
<TwoFive> Hazard: Neither was I, but I did it.
<MrChang> i got win7 ulti edition for free
<Wrek> 05>implyign you got to be an expert
<Hazard> wow
<TwoFive> ^
<MrChang> come at me, krakass
<Hazard> now your just fucking trolling me
<Krakass> Hazard, there are instructions on the web, but for the most part its plug and play.
<Shizuka> 13i think space mutiny will be fun cause it's campy turned up to 12
<CupcakeWarrior> Just download Windows 7 from TPB guys
<Wrek> 05ive built a total of 14 computers
<Midnight_Tempest> Hazard: you dont need to be an expert... computers are actually really simple to put together
<Wrek> 05each time it gets easier and cheaper
<TwoFive> I've built 5
<Krakass> MrChang, huh?
<Dashie_Dashie> >implying that i'm implying because that's implying someone implying.
<TwoFive> My first was easy.
<Dashie_Dashie> >wat
<TwoFive> Hazard: Are you like 10 or something?
<KwakLad> I have built 7
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I built a lego clock, does that count?
<RaveBrony> Ive built many computers (most not mine tho :()
<MrChang> putting together a computer isn't very difficult
<The_4th_Wall> L
<MrChang> its just tedious
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03and a lego robot!
<CupcakeWarrior> How is Hazard being an idiot?
<RAWRity> You don't have to be an expert, but if you're not educated on the basic hardward of a computer, then yeah, not the best idea to try and build your own. If you've got a tech savvy friend who's willing to help, then talk to them first.
<TwoFive> It's easy as hell
<Hazard> TwoFive: you have been fucking trolling me for 20 minutes telling me a retard
<Wrek> 05buildign a lego clock is more complicated that putting a comp together
<The_4th_Wall> Scoot-Scootaloo::D
*emangamer hugs Shizuka "IDK why but I feel like I have to tell you how much I love you"
<RaveBrony> Lol!!!
<Hazard> im god damn sick and fucking tired of it
<MrChang> lego=/=round
<MrChang> =(
<TwoFive> Hazard: >telling me a retard
<TwoFive> Lol
<Midnight_Tempest> ive helped put together about 5 comps... taken apart 10 times as many though, so i have a good understanding
<Dashie_Dashie> Computer's really don't see complicated at all to build.
<Krakass> I know its not difficult I was just saying there are instructions online if you need them.
*The_4th_Wall brohoofs Scoot-Scootaloo
<Hazard> TwoFive i did not call you a retard you just did it yourself
<Hazard> Kudos to u
<TwoFive> Computers are easy as hell to build
<Wrek> 05TwoFive quit torlling, Hazard stop being butthurt.
<Wrek> 05or ill get rid of both of you
<Hazard> im not butthurt :P
<Jim> What's a drama?
<RaveBrony> :o
<The_4th_Wall> thx, Wrek]
<KwakLad> Considering computers are now effectly modular and designed to be easilly constructable, i mean they even have words next to some ports/slots telling you what they are for
<Hazard> im just telling it the way it is
<Shizuka> 13wrek has to break up the schoolground fights
<Krakass> Jim, your a filly and what is this?
<KwakLad> lego doesnt have written on the block exactly what its for
<RAWRity> TwoFive: really, you are being a dick here. Hazard doesn't know as much as you, stop acting like you're brilliant for knowing basic hardware.
<F1uttershy> thank you wrek
<TwoFive> Hazard: You're like 10, right? Ask your mom or dad. Seriously. My mom helped me with my first one when I was like 10.
<Krakass> *you're
*Midnight_Tempest raises his anti-hate sheilds
<TwoFive> Rawrity: I'm just astonished that he doesn't know anything.
<Hazard> TwoFive stop threatening me!
<Hazard> :D
<TwoFive> Wat
<Hazard> that was a joke :D
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_>
<DerpyPie> Is anything playing in the live stream? Nothing is on mine.
<Wrek> 05last warnign you two.
*The_4th_Wall starts loving and tolerating TwoFive
<RaveBrony> O.O
<Jim> My stream just went away
<Hazard> what did i ever do to TwoFive to be banned or kicked?
<F1uttershy> same
<TwoFive> Wrek: I'm actually trying to give him helpful adivce now.
<RAWRity> TwoFive: I suppose I should start acting like you're complete moron becuase you don't know as much about obscure british post-hardcore bands?
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i'm amazed at the amount of hate right now
<KwakLad> Wrel 'two' being hazard and twofive?
<TwoFive> Rawrity: You see, those are exactly what you said. Obscure. Computers are commonplace.
<Hazard> i dont hate i love and tolerate
<CupcakeWarrior> I didnt expect trolling in a place like this
<Dashie_Dashie> It exsist's
<TwoFive> Hazard: Google it, or go on 4chan's /g/. They have good people who'll help you.
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i expected trolling but the hate
<Dashie_Dashie> everywhere you go.
<Hazard> computers and electronics are cool but to be a complete genius in my prespective you need to learn alot of math and science
<F1uttershy> i agree CupcakeWarrior
<Midnight_Tempest> trolling happens all the time here... usually in good taste between people... but it gets out of hand somedays
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> the hate is new for me
<KwakLad> CupcakeWarrior: i dont think any of this is quite what trolling is
<The_4th_Wall> Please stop the hostility; this isn't what Bronystate's about
<Hazard> but i can see you know alot so im not complaining or calling you not smart
<TwoFive> Hazard: Nobody can no everything, man.
<TwoFive> Know*
<KwakLad> But for tha sake of the comunity i agree with your point CupcakeWarrior
<Wrek> 05time out

<Hazard> this started out as a simple debate over which PCs are better but who cares what kind it is? we just need to use them because thats what their for. Calculations and doing what we cant normally do. and guess what? lets blame ACTA or whatever that stupid thing is. Thats what is going to ruin the internet. that and trolls but mostly ACTA

<brieannar> guess what
<Kammerjunk> Why do I have so MANY FANFICS.
<The_4th_Wall> on the fleece throw, Kammerjunk?
<Saturn> 08,01so i just had a rather amusing conversation with a friend of mine
<LadyCanary> Do tell Saturn~
<IngloriousPony89> About what Saturn?
<Kammerjunk> Just in general.
<KwakLad> Also has twin so bangin'
<brieannar> i can blow a bubble without a bubble with out a bubble wand or anything that can use bubbles with
<Saturn> 08,01we were talking about postage, and he said "so long as I intercept my mail before my flatmates, if i'm buying crinkle"
<Saturn> 08,01and i said "what's crinkle?"
<Saturn> 08,01apparently, he was referring to adult diapers
<LadyCanary> ...Wat
<Kammerjunk> Verb: Form small creases or wrinkles in the surface of something, esp. the skin of the face as the result of a facial expression.
<The_4th_Wall> WILL PAY DOUBLE FOR THAT BED SET
<Kammerjunk> Noun:	A wrinkle or crease found on the surface of something: "there was a crinkle of suspicion on her forehead".
<Saturn> 08,01which he quickly qualified with "i'm not into that sort of stuff, they're just... really comfy!"
<Saturn> 08,01they're padding, see
<Saturn> 08,01and also, and this was the killer
<brieannar> send me a message on youtube my account name is cupcakesrock111
<IngloriousPony89> And do you live in the UK/Australia Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01"also, they allow me to sit for hours playing minecraft without having to get up to go to the bathroom"
<Saturn> 08,01i found that really funny
<otakon> hiya Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01hey otakon!
*LadyCanary giggles. So silly.
<CriticKitten> I like how there's guns and ammo and medpacks EVERYWHERE during the zombie apocalypse.
<Saturn> 08,01IngloriousPony89: uk, aye
*otakon hugs LadyCanary "How are you dear?"
<Kammerjunk> So I googled 'crinkle'. Google asked me for baking ingredients.
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, i'm pretty sure he wasn't even joking
<brieannar> when will the aliens come?
<CriticKitten> Makes you feel nice and safe.
<Kammerjunk> With what you said, Saturn, that makes it pretty creepy.
<LadyCanary> I has food otakon :3 so I am pleased. And yourself?
<otakon> brieannar: there ARE no aliens in this game
<Saturn> 08,01he seems to have taken gaming to a new level
<IngloriousPony89> Creepy indeed
<brieannar> no
<CriticKitten> knowing that there's weapon caches everywhere if such a game should become reality
<otakon> LadyCanary: pretty good, had rabbit stew for dinner
<IngloriousPony89> A new, terrifying level
<brieannar> no no in the real world not the game

<CupcakeWarrior> I would eat alligator soup
<Kammerjunk> You wouldn't eat a TV.

<Saturn> 08,01well, he already has a fridge by the computer
<Kammerjunk> You wouldn't eat a handbag.
<otakon> Saturn: that is not good stuff
<Sumica> 00,105...4...3...starts fireing
<LadyCanary> She will have her revenge.
<IngloriousPony89> Probably not a good idea KwakLad. Dont want to encourage him :P
<CriticKitten> Fair 'nuff. I'm eating a bowl of Scootaloo soup with dumplings right now, myself.
<otakon> LadyCanary: it was Angel's evil twin
<Kammerjunk> You wouldn't eat a DVD.

<RAWRity> So, word's in as far as The Secret World of Arriety as far as critics are concerned.
<PinkiePieCopy> I'm back
<RAWRity> Apparently it bouls down to: Very good animation, very good character writing, Pacing was shot to hell.
<PinkiePieCopy> Atill nopony's gonna eat my mane yet
<RAWRity> *boils even
<PinkiePieCopy> ?Still-
<TopHat> LIKE A FAWST

<PinkiePieCopy> LFD stream
<Dark_Horst> hmm
<PinkieCupcake> Hi everypony! :)
<Dark_Horst> ah, there it is
<PinkiePieCopy> Hi
<ThePal> Hello there. :)
<JTDrift> dat tuba.
<IngloriousPony89> Hey Pinkie
<Kammerjunk> So has everypony seen the poll on EQD?
<PinkieCupcake> Lol.
<RAWRity> How you know you're getting old: You no longer rejoice at the idea of snow, but instead dread the state of the roadways in the coming morning.
<PinkiePieCopy> Anyone wanna pokemon battle for the rest of my mane
<PinkiePieCopy> ?
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: I have. I voted for Derpy and the Dr.
<Kammerjunk> I voted for the Equestrian history.
<Kammerjunk> I LOVE lore.
<PinkiePieCopy> I voted for Wrek
<Atom_Split> Yay for lore. I so understand that.
*IngloriousPony89 is going to EqD now
<Aircrafter> Why does it have too be so difficult too play tf2 and watch mlp at the same time...
<PinkiePieCopy> Get a spray
<Kammerjunk> Lore also opens up new fanfic possibilities, and I'm always looking for more ways to procrastinate.
<Atom_Split> My own favorite episodes are cutie mark chronicles and hearths warming because of all that wonderful information
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: that would have been my second pic.
<RAWRity> *pick
<Aircrafter> oo they're adding friends...
<PinkieCupcake> I like derpy...I heard a rumor that said Hasbro is going to change Derpy's name
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I <3 Sonic Rainboom and May The Best Pet Win.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They were.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, it was never confirmed.
<PinkiePieCopy> Damnit, Ditzy
<TOY_PON3> I don't really have a favorite episode
<IngloriousPony89> I picked Lore as well
<PinkiePieCopy> Does anyone wanna pkmn battle?
<IngloriousPony89> A pikmin battle?
<PinkiePieCopy> POKEMON
<PinkiePieCopy> XD
<RAWRity> But c'mon...IT'S DERPY AND THE DOCTOR. WITH SHENANIGANS. We'd finally know how Derpy got into that snow globe!
<RAWRity> PinkieCupcake: just rumors. nothing's come of it, nothing is likely to come of it.
<IngloriousPony89> Ohhhhhhhhh
<RAWRity> it's just an unpleasant shit storm that will hopefully be left buried in the past from not on.
<Kammerjunk> The reason I didn't pick the Doctor & Derpy one was partly because I have to agree with dari on the 11th Doctor and partly because I will spend an entire day just reading about the lore of whatever.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There was a thing where some people got angry because the portrayed Derpy as a retard. They stated that Derpy insulted disabled people.
<Celestia> 0,5My favorite episode used the be Lesson Zero... but then I took a "Last Roundup" to the knee.
<TOY_PON3> lol
<LadyCanary> Celestia!!!! :D
<Kammerjunk> My favourite episode is still Lesson Zero.
*PinkiePieCopy shoots Celestia in the knee with an arrow
<Kammerjunk> HI GIRLZ
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03>_>
<Shizuka> 13lolcrashed ><
<PinkiePieCopy> CUT OFF THE DAMN JOKE
<kidzrul434> Definetly the last roundup
<IngloriousPony89> Lesson Zero was the funniest episode
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: Well, Dr. Whooves is apparently meant to look like the TENTH doctor, so...
*LadyCanary flies over to Celestia and nestles in his...her? mane.
<Celestia> 0,5It was very funny
<Atom_Split> I'm not the greatst fan of lesson zero, i prefer Twi her normal adorable way
<Kammerjunk> Oh, good. But still.
<Celestia> 0,5*girly wave*
<Celestia> 0,5Im a woman
<Celestia> 0,5_/`
*RAWRity doesn't get why people are so in love with Lesson Zero
<TOY_PON3> Swanlestia
<Kammerjunk> No you're not, you're a piece of bacon with a bacon mane.
<TrixieMuffin> When you claim that something insults disabled people , not being one of them , you are insulting disabled people !
<DashWithRainbows> Because insanity RAWRity.
<LadyCanary> Mother of god, Celestia.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lesson Zero is now the most elected episode here.
<TOY_PON3> Yeah
<PinkieCupcake> Trollestia or Discord?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Discord.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: even more than Sonic Rainboom?
<TOY_PON3> Discord
<PinkiePieCopy> Guys
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: Well, I'd reckon you don't get why I love Trixie either, so that's fine.
<Shizuka> 13blah now tf2 won't relaunch .-.
<PinkiePieCopy> Anyone wanna pokemon battle?
<Kammerjunk> I wasn't around when Derpy came to be, so that takes some of it away from me.
<Shizuka> 13dumm tf2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sonic Rainboom needs to be picked more.
<PinkiePieCopy> Shizuka
<PinkiePieCopy> Add me on Steam
<PinkiePieCopy> my nick is Magical Pyro
<Shizuka> 13warum?
<Tarku> ohai everypony, and same problem Shizuka
<PinkiePieCopy> Add meeee
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: S1 EP16 used to be my favourite one, until I saw EP23.
<PinkiePieCopy> >=3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Party of One?
<PinkieCupcake> Well I'm new here so I'm kinda getting use to the brony community :)
<PinkiePieCopy> My favorite is the Daring Do episode
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: I can understand Trixie's fanbase to an extent but..I just don't see WHY people love it so much. I can understand (even if I disagree with) the fangasm over Luna Eclipsed, because y'know, it's Luna. But Lesson Zero doesn't really have anything that explains the love for it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Read it and Weep?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Cutie Mark Chronicles all day, errday!
<Phase4> text wall
<Kammerjunk> No, the Cutie Mark Chronicles.

<Shizuka> 13ooo open slot
<Shizuka> 13wait for emeeee

*PinkiePieCopy breaks Scoot-Scootaloo's scooter
<Kammerjunk> Episode 23, then.
<TOY_PON3> brb
<LadyCanary> Yaaaaay Shizuka's gonna play <3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03D:<
<Phase4> RAWRity: its a twi centric s2 episode, we only have one
<PinkieCupcake> :)
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: There's that. Twilight is also my favourite pony of all. And it was fun to watch.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Your lucky I'm trying to find the super special Plasma Rifle...
*PinkiePieCopy destroys that too
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03D:<<<
<Aircrafter> o_o
<IngloriousPony89> I gotta eat and take a shower everypony. See y'all later.
<Kammerjunk> Holy hay, I just realised that there's like 8 episodes left of series 2.
<LadyCanary> Bye IngloriousPony89!
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, IngloriousPony89.
<Phase4> later IngloriousPony89
<TrixieMuffin> i think Lesson Zero is the one that will destroy the "for kids" stigma if you show it to new people , even more than party of one
<Phase4> lolwut? octy in the drawfriend
<Kammerjunk> ^ wat
<TOY_PON3> My dad just ruined plans for dinner.. :|
<PartyCannon> TrixieMuffin indeed :)
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: http://derpy.me/GHcZD
<Shizuka> 13sorry canary, maybe next time <3
<Kammerjunk> I generally don't visit drawfriends. There are only so many hours in the day.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I thought you meant Octy as in an octopus.
*TOY_PON3 glares at Dismo for taking Shizuka's spot :|
<Shizuka> 13X3
<Kammerjunk> Still, that's a pretty neat pony.
<PinkieCupcake> Octy as in Octavia?
<PinkiePieCopy> Toy_Pon3 what's your steam username
<PinkiePieCopy> MUST KNOW
<TrixieMuffin> Octotavia is best ponysquid
<PinkiePieCopy> Shizuka what's yours too?
<Kammerjunk> Aaaaand mIRC decided to be a jerk to me again.
<Shizuka> 13i do not like rochelle much anyways... zoey ist much better
<RAWRity> I can see that, TrixieMuffin. It's probably the best episode to show to skepticks.
<TOY_PON3> TOY_PON3?
<Kammerjunk> Luna-darned keyboard layouts.
<PinkieCupcake> TrixieMuffin So true she is the best pony squid
<PinkiePieCopy> I hope Scoot-Scootaloo doesn't kill me
<Kammerjunk> I hate this layout thing.
<Kammerjunk> Testing, testing - æøåøæå
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03ONce I find a plasma rifle...
<Kammerjunk> Good.
*PinkiePieCopy holds one
<PinkiePieCopy> Hehe
<PinkieCupcake> Lol
*PinkiePieCopy hands it to Scoot-Scootlaoo and gets a 10 second head start
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03YOU!!
<DaringDude> silly pinkie chickens cant kill you
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'll get you!
<RAWRity> So, remember how people were saying that Season 2 was lacking on songs? I feel like the latest ep was made JUST to get those people to shut up.
<PinkiePieCopy> 10 second slatah
<Phase4> ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03hey Phase4!
<PinkiePieCopy> Crap
<PinkiePieCopy> now there's 2 ponies looking for me
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: And I feel like it worked.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I got you now, Pinkie!
<RAWRity> Oh, we need more songs? HERE'S 4 IN ONE EPISODE.
<Sumica> 00,10hey Nittany_Discord, how long were you planing on this any ways?
<Kammerjunk> Four songs in a single episode.
<Saturn> 08,01but only one was good
<PinkiePieCopy> Oh no
<Phase4> ohai Saturn
<PinkiePieCopy> i'm cornered
<RAWRity> So the current Song count for S2 = 11
<Saturn> 08,01and to be fair, it was the best song of the season
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what's going on between PinkiePieCopy and Scoot-Scootaloo, and I don't think I want to.
<Saturn> 08,01possibly the best song of the entire program
<Celestia> 0,5Yes?
<Kammerjunk> So dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
<Saturn> 08,01nay, the entire franchise
<Saturn> 08,01*neigh
<Celestia> 0,5YES?
<PinkiePieCopy> I broke his/her scooter
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Kammerjunk: He/she broke my scooter!
<LadyCanary> Smiiiiile~
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<PinkieCupcake> Poor scooter
<RAWRity> Entire program? Eh, gotta say Art of the Dress still holds that for me, but it WAS the best song for S2, most def.
<TrixieMuffin> Hey no dissin the hymn of Smooze
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gives Scoot-Scootaloo a new scooter.
<Kammerjunk> That's good enoguh reason to shoot her with a plasma rifle, I suppose.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:D
*PinkiePieCopy breaks it
<Kammerjunk> enough*
<PinkiePieCopy> Tehheee
<Saturn> 08,01i didn't really like Art of the Dress
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:[
<LadyCanary> ...I-I liked it.
<Saturn> 08,01it was too much like an existing Sondheim song
<RAWRity> and yes, I do still say most def.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01covers PinkiePieCopy and explodes.
<Saturn> 08,01an awesome Sondheim song, nonetheless
<PinkiePieCopy> He saved me
<PinkiePieCopy> =D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:D
*PinkiePieCopy eat's Nittany's raw flesh
<LadyCanary> Because I like pretty dresses and stuff >3>
<TrixieMuffin> nothing can stop the SMOOOOOOZEE
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dresses LadyCanary up.
<PinkieCupcake> I like the Find a pet song and the giggle at the ghosties song
<Kammerjunk> So who was talking about that picture in the drawfriend?
<PinkiePieCopy> JK
<LadyCanary> Nittany_Discord: But Im not a doll D:

<PinkiePieCopy> So now what? Kill me? Hold me? Eat me? Eat my mane?
<stallion1> 100 people!
<Kammerjunk> Because it's the only one I'm even close to having the skill to sing.

<Phase4> Kirby + Pinkie = MOST POWERFULL BEING IN ALL OF EXISTENCE
<Derpy_Hooves> ^
<The_4th_Wall> 20% cooler, indeed

<Kammerjunk> And then Francis was ded.
<LadyCanary> :D :D
<flutter_spin> wait, Toy_Pon3 is playing?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So close.
<Kammerjunk> Ignore him! Get to the safehouse!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> flutter_spin: hes the almost dead guy
<KwakLad> yup flutter_spin
<TOY_PON3> But I'm not the dead guy ;)

<Kammerjunk> This... Socks...
<LadyCanary> Dem socks.
<otakon> yh
<Kammerjunk> It seriously sounded like he was saying socks and not sucks.
<otakon> too bad it's 8:30 at night now
<emangamer> LadyCanary: socks?
<Kammerjunk> Louis must be a Luna fan.
<SayWhat> CCCP: Oh my god...
<flutter_spin> I never played or watched this game
<SayWhat> I WUB IT
<flutter_spin> This might be.. interesting if its multiplayer
<otakon> flutter_spin: it's fun
<CCCP> SayWhat: MUHAHAHA
<otakon> flutter_spin: it is
<Phase4> so pasific = est right?
<SayWhat> I still hate Kirby
<[SWAG]thehated5689> http://memegenerator.net/instance/11016291
<flutter_spin> So what, 2 players and 2 comp?
<Kammerjunk> The most fun I have in this game is exploiting the hilariously bad engine.
<Kammerjunk> flutter_spin: 4 players.
<Kammerjunk> Or 8.
<Kammerjunk> Depends on the gamemode.
<flutter_spin> I meant right now
<Phase4> [SWAG]thehated5689: Nicely done
<Kammerjunk> 4 players right now.
*emangamer could still use a hug
<flutter_spin> Are there 2 that are zombies?
<SayWhat> I imagine Super Smash bros + Ponies like this : http://www.google.com/imgres?num=10&um=1&hl=en&biw=1366&bih=705&tbm=isch&tbnid=_5xgQTN4R1rq_M:&imgrefurl=http://www.halolz.com/category/games/smash-bros/&docid=Yag4YrxAviZarM&imgurl=http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/halolz-dot-com-captainfalcon-mylittlepony-showmeyahooves.jpg&w=500&h=519&ei=naJBT_n0M4-ltwewzqG-BQ&zoom=1&iact=rc&dur=331&sig=102856315741588518605&sqi=2&page=1&
<CCCP> i dont know how to hug
<SayWhat> Dat link :o
<Shizuka> 13dat google image search link
<Kammerjunk> You're at a hospital because the chopper that'll rescue you is at the very top of the hospital.
<Wrek> 05i think he hates hospitals
<emangamer> SayWhat: your such a n00w
<emangamer> n00b
<Kammerjunk> I hate hospitals. And doctors, and lawyers, and cops.
<CCCP> SayWhat: use derpy.me
<RAWRity> note to self: Hospitals are shit for fighting zombies
<flutter_spin> I just find it odd that other players characters say default messages
<emangamer> CCCP: no...just do it right and not link the wrong thing
<Phase4> dat link wall
<flutter_spin> I guess it is a nice feature.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> tankrty tanker tank
*meh returns to see l4d "awesome"
*emangamer still needs a hug
*meh hugs emangamer
*SayWhat hugs eman
<[SWAG]thehated5689> meh: o' course

<flutter_spin> haha! the fun has been doubled!@
<SayWhat> Huzzah
<emangamer> FUCKING FINALLY...I've waited forever
<LadyCanary> Ooooooh~
<Kammerjunk> The weird Talisman-Jackie, that is.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> Hooplah!
<SayWhat> Sounds like a lot of...
<CCCP> this may sound really stupid but how do you make text slanted?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> Hooplah!
<emangamer> CCCP: /me
<Jaketehsnake> Jackie Chan is mah steam name
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: /me
<SayWhat> /me
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
*flutter_spin learns something new
<Saturn> 08,01http://derpibooru.org/2704
<emangamer> CCCP: you mean italics?
<CCCP> ya
<meh> so hows everyone doing tonight (or day)
<SayWhat> Good!
<SayWhat> Not meh
<meh> yay
<Jaketehsnake> Saturn *slow Clap*
<[SWAG]thehated5689> meh a tad laggy and made my dog throw up by hiting her with a snowball, you?
<flutter_spin> So there are weapons randomly laid out in the hospital? heh
<emangamer> Saturn: that might have been a little too inappropriate
<RAWRity> emangamer: nah, it's fine.
<flutter_spin> I saw it on EQD
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: But funny nevertheless.
<emangamer> Shizuka: you seen the newest drawfriend?
<RAWRity> People seem to think PG-13 can't have suggestive material.
<CountDoofus> who's streaming btw?
<Shizuka> 13no why
<[SWAG]thehated5689> CountDoofus: nittany
<SayWhat> This ain't innapropriate
<Kammerjunk> Drawfriends would be the end of me if I followed them.
<SayWhat> I handled Fluttershy snapping a bear's neck
<emangamer> Shizuka: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fKzZXyMdkpQ/T0GDvO78o2I/AAAAAAAAfuo/eLWPZnjEazc/s1600/134963+-+artist+Don-KomandoRR+heavy_weapons_guy+pinkie_pie+sasha+Team_Fortress_2+umbrella.jpg
<meh> implied boink boink is fine
<SayWhat> I think i got this
<Shizuka> 13that first one?
<Shizuka> 13but i do not play heavy .-.
<CountDoofus> oh Shizuka, you were in that TF2 game earlier right?
<Jaketehsnake> Which do you guys prefer, L4D or Killing FLoor?
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Credit to team.
<SayWhat> Killing floor
<Shizuka> 13und besides i thought fluttershy x heavy was the canon pair
<[SWAG]thehated5689> L4D
<TOY_PON3> .___.
<meh> ded
<emangamer> Shizuka: ...wat?
<Applz> aww
<Kammerjunk> Jaketehsnake: Never played Killing Floor, so I can't make a qualified decision.
<meh> so whos streamin?
<Kammerjunk> >canon
<emangamer> I have no idea what you just said Shizuka
<Kammerjunk> SURE.
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I mean we ARE seeing people killing hundreds of zombies
<CountDoofus> haven't played Killing Floor, so I'd say L4D
<[SWAG]thehated5689> meh: nittany i think
<Shizuka> 13in gmod videos
<meh> cool
<Shizuka> 13heavy is always paired with fluttershy, not pinkie
<ScootaChicken> hey everypony ^_^
<Kammerjunk> He is, isn't he.
<CountDoofus> heya Scoota
<ScootaChicken> oh look, L4D
<[SWAG]thehated5689> heyo ScootaChicken
<Applz> Herro
<Kammerjunk> That's probably because of the irony.
<meh> hi Nittany_Discord give them a sound butt woopin for me
<Jaketehsnake> KammerJunk, I got it for 2.99 a few daus ago. Standard play is 6 people but some modded games allow 20. Moar zombies too!
<SolarBlaze> Shizuka: who is pinkie paired with? i forget..
<emangamer> Shizuka: ...wat?
<Kammerjunk> But you have to admit, Pinkie and the Heavy would probably get along just fine.
<Shizuka> 13pinkie pairs with...
<Shizuka> 13soldier i think
<Jaketehsnake> or Medic
<SolarBlaze> rarity is with spy
<Shizuka> 13twilight with sniper, AJ with engie
<LadyCanary> Hi ScootaChicken!!
<emangamer> Shizuka: I still dont knwo whats going on...you forget that I still cant get Steam to work
<Shizuka> 13rarity with spy
<RAWRity> for some reason, Rarity is spy. I dun geddit
<Kammerjunk> Jaketehsnake: I don't even play L4D a lot.
<CountDoofus> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-acayTANw7Kk/TioPFTBv5SI/AAAAAAAAI-c/uOLmdv3fPCE/s1600/37265+-+deleteme_dupe+fluttershy+heavy+medic+parody+rarity+spy+team_fortrees_2+tf2.jpg hehehe
<Capn_fisty> I wouldve said medic with pinkie
<[SWAG]thehated5689> dat flyingcharger
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: It's the sophistication associated with being French, I suppose.
<Kammerjunk> The Spy has always been a gentleman.
<Applz> She can speak french I guess that's why
<SayWhat> http://derpy.me/dJRpT Problem?
<CCCP> CountDoofus: 0.o
<emangamer> CountDoofus: umm...is that...I dont...what
<Jaketehsnake> I love the gentelmen side of the spy
<RAWRity> CountDoofus: they should have stayed out of her shed.
<flutter_spin> Rarity cares about how she looks, even if its like another person :P
<CountDoofus> :)
<meh> soooooo... how bout dat smile?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> im making it a goal to click all the links
<Kammerjunk> SayWhat: My mind should probably be blown at that, but it's Pinkie Pie, so it's best to not think about it.
<SayWhat> How bout dem lakerz?
<meh> knicks
<flutter_spin> dat music
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi there, random Jockey.
<CCCP> there NEEDS to be an Apple Jack emoticon
<CountDoofus> hey Shizuka, were you in that TF2 game earlier?
<Kammerjunk> That music suggests a Witch.
<SayWhat> And spike
<Jaketehsnake> I just watched Mystery Science theatre 3000 last night.
<Shizuka> 13yup
<emangamer> Hmmm...eternal looks interseting
<Shizuka> 13the pyro doing badly? yup
<LadyCanary> You DONT say Kammerjunk.
<Kammerjunk> And then you completely ignore your previous failures with witches.
<CountDoofus> if you want, I have a Strange Backburner I don't use
<flutter_spin> Do you guys get scared while playing?
<emangamer> seriously, it pisses me off that I can't get steam to work...
<RAWRity> Fun Fact: acording do Wiki, Pinkie Pie is the only pony to have her uvula shown on screen in every episode she's in.
<Kammerjunk> LadyCanary: I was just commenting on what flutter_spin said.
<CCCP> Jaketehsnake: <3 MST3K
<Kammerjunk> Dat EXTRA PISTOL.
<meh> oddly enough this game doesnt scare me and yet resident evil makes me jump all the time
<LadyCanary> Ah. My bad Kammerjunk ^^" been up since 7am so Im a bit out of it
<CCCP> i have uhhh.somthing to admit amnesia doesn't scare me
<emangamer> no one ever knows how to get my steam to work....both Shizuka and Luna have given up on me
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff.
<meh> voices?!
<Kammerjunk> Sleep is for the weak, you know.
<Jaketehsnake> CCCP it was very... different. In an amazing way. My friends usually do that kind of commentary with our movies but we didnt have to this time!
<flutter_spin> So a witch is something everyone should be afraid of?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> dat lederp voice
<Shizuka> 13dunno what's wrong with your steam .-.
<meh> she just needs a hug
<emangamer> Shizuka: haven't we been though this? I cant connect to the server
<CountDoofus> L4D creeped my out the first few times I played it, then it's just a normal shooter
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: It's a very atmospheric game. It requires you to WANT to be scared by it.
<SayWhat> I require sustainance, i shall be back
<CountDoofus> me* out
<Kammerjunk> To really get into the story.
<SayWhat> I GO
<Kammerjunk> YOU GO
<[SWAG]thehated5689> IT GOES
<otakon> Shizuka: I checked my cache earlier and it was fine. I don't know why I couldn't connect
<CountDoofus> dat Jockey
<otakon> you go!
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: i like the game actually but it only makes me feel slightly uneasy
<meh> lemme think i know i saw something that scared me into total wuss status recently but i forgot what
<Jaketehsnake> My buddie's science fair was heart rates during videogames the only game that had a signifigant difference was amnesia. 25BPM
<otakon> brb guys
<flutter_spin> I want to hear more girly screams!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> bah, streams laggy
<CountDoofus> anypony else want to play a game of L4D?
<Kammerjunk> I just have a tendency to get scared at those atmospheric games. It's a lot different than if you were watching a film.
<Jaketehsnake> CountDoofus Count me in
<[SWAG]thehated5689> the stream was insulted and lagged my out D:
<Kammerjunk> In a film, every event is set in stone.
<CountDoofus> I played F.E.A.R. once... never again

<KwakLad> ScootaChicken: so Military police and Members of parliament both MP's are my little ponies?
<Kammerjunk> KwakLad: They are now.

<Midnight_Tempest> emangamer: too tomboyish
<Kammerjunk> The best thing to do here is to just exploit the engine,
<flutter_spin> Woot! People are talking!
<Kammerjunk> Nope.
<Midnight_Tempest> then they all died...
<Kammerjunk> And then my stream froze.
<Jaketehsnake> and then ponies

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.livestream.com/nittanydiscord <- If anyone wants to continue to watch our game.
<flutter_spin> depends on what is going on here.
<Kammerjunk> What's going on in this ro-
<Kammerjunk> Aww hay.
<Sumica> 00,10it's also good cause it gets nitt more views on his LS.
<pony_8310> rawr
<flutter_spin> hahaha
<flutter_spin> Yes.
<Ponyrokkusu> Where did I put that little piece of rainbow?
<Ponyrokkusu> ...why am I stuck thinking of g1 ponies?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3FMA:B? I approve :)
<Sumica> 00,10Shoo be doo?
<Ponyrokkusu> SHOO SHOO BE DOO
<LadyCanary> Ah brotherhood!
<emangamer> what is this?
<Ponyrokkusu> Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood
<TOY_PON3> FMA <3
<TOY_PON3> I love Winry
<LadyCanary> Been so long since I've seen FMA in general.
<LadyCanary> Heard brotherhood wwas good though.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3follows the manga more closely
<CrossChop114> ... FMA? :D
<herostar> hey kirzstryfe
<Ponyrokkusu> The TV show overtook the Manga, that's why it had to be different, or so I've heard.
<Ponyrokkusu> The uh, anime I mean
<Ponyrokkusu> And then they did it with the Manga's ending for Brotherhood
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hey :)
<LadyCanary> Al!
<herostar> full metal alchemist
<LadyCanary> Oh my gosh! How I've missed him.
<herostar> whats that kids name again?
<LadyCanary> Al
<RAWRity> meh, I kinda disagree with people who say sticking to the manga necessarily makes an anime good.
<herostar> i used to watch it late at night. great anime
<Ponyrokkusu> Alfons.. or Alfonz... however you spell it.
<LadyCanary> True, though sometimes the manga IS better than the anime. Example: Rosario Vampire.
<herostar> OH YEA
<TOY_PON3> Alfonse
<herostar> DAFONZE Xd
<Ponyrokkusu> My sound is broken, so I can't hear what's going on. :C
<RAWRity> AlFonzy: I ain't got no bodyrino, EEEHHHHHHH
<Ponyrokkusu> EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<herostar> wtf
<SayWhat> WhaaA?
<LadyCanary> ...He's hungreh?
<SayWhat> Lickitung?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3there are some things anime can convey better than manga, and vice versa
<herostar> ouch
<Ponyrokkusu> Gluttony is always hungry
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: well he IS GLuttony
<RAWRity> also, I think we saw this ep already.
<LadyCanary> Ahhh.
<LadyCanary> Been a whole since Ive seen all this
<SayWhat> Dat Lickitung
<SuperBrony64|FOOD> 10,02Hmm...I really should go and get food...
<herostar> EWW
<SuperBrony64|FOOD> 10,02mfw I haven't eaten anything this entire time O__O
<RAWRity> I believe we left off with Gluttony opening up his stomach to try and kill Mustang.
*kirzstryfe tackle-glomps SuperBrony64
<Sumica> 00,10yes less eating at 3am SB
<herostar> WHAT
<LadyCanary> Go get foooood
<Sumica> 00,10Jack in the box every night is bad for you.
<SayWhat> This is so weird
<SayWhat> What is going on?!
<SuperBrony64|FOOD> 10,02I love Jack in the Box and it'
<DaringDude> lol dog
<SuperBrony64|FOOD> 10,02it's good for me ^_^
<herostar> EWW POOR PUPPY
<ScootaChicken> skype conversations keeping me up
<Hodiku> SB64, you should definately go get more tacos :$
<SayWhat> It like the arm
<kirzstryfe> 1,3bad guy was tracking her blood, so they cut off her arm and tied it to the dog
<SayWhat> don't worry bout it
<ScootaChicken> and OMG WUT IS THAT A DOG WITH AN ARM ON IT
<ScootaChicken> WAT
<SayWhat> This show is just full of wtfmode
<LadyCanary> ...Oooh.
<LadyCanary> D;
<LadyCanary> Ouch.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3FMA:B, went a bit darker than the first run of the series
<ScootaChicken> and why did that guy earlier look like that guy from Naruto
<RAWRity> SayWhat: basically: Eyepatch dude and Fat guy are monsters trying to kill all humans, blond guy and amrmor dude, as wells as the asian guy, are trying to stop them. Scarfaced guy is antihero who hates the blond guy and armor dude
<SayWhat> I get it now
<Hodiku> original FMA had such a strange end...
<SayWhat> Thansk
<Sumica> 00,10he took a chibi to the face.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<SayWhat> But the armor dude ain't a dude
<RAWRity> asian girl and panda are friends with scarface and want to protect them.
<LadyCanary> :D What a cutie.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah he's just a suit of armor with a soul in it.
<SayWhat> Dat pentagram
<herostar> damn
<ScootaChicken> not sure how seriously this anime wants me take it
<RAWRity> dat Alcahestry
<SayWhat> I'm not sure tiher?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3this early in it, not very
<LadyCanary> ...Why have I not watched this series.
<herostar> i have that ability in wicca in the middle of june O-O
<SayWhat> either*
<LadyCanary> WHYYY.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3gets serious later on
<SayWhat> He asian
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: that's kind of Brotherhood's biggest fault. it tends to stick comic relief in the middle of tense drama a lot.
<Sumica> 00,10You are not supposed to take it serious, it's just a TV show.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3saw Li's VA this weekend :)
<SayWhat> But i take MLP seriously
<Sumica> 00,10that's not a TV show, it's a way of life
<DaynNightGaming> True that.
<Hodiku> ;)
<SayWhat> Ahhh, I seeeeee
<herostar> PIIIIEEEE
<SayWhat> N'yess
<Sumica> 00,10there are no life lessons in this
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: if you're interested, Funimation has all of FMA, both dub and sub, on their Youtube page.
<LadyCanary> As I am aware ^_^ thank you
<SayWhat> Well, the life lesson would be to take super powers out of pentagrams? Does it tell us to warship satan?
<ScootaChicken> it just seems a bit weird that in the middle of this dark, futuristic, dystopian anime you have girls running around in Kimonos
<emangamer> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lznp3n7kSZ1rnpo0wo1_400.gif
<ScootaChicken> and... y'know, scenes like this
<DaynNightGaming> Everytime I hear Japanese I only think of Total War: Shogun 2, "A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!"
<RAWRity> nah, see the other alchemists gain their power from HEXagrams!
<herostar> LOL
<SayWhat> Dat panda
<RAWRity> so it's really supporting Jews

<RaveBrony> Omfg!! When did this start!?!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3suit of armor is Ed's brother's soul stuck in a suit of armor
<The_4th_Wall> What's a fullmetal alchemust?
<SayWhat> But...
<Hazard> hes a 14 year old boy
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: so what you're saying is, Shizuka would be completely useless in the fight against an ancient, deranged eldritch abomination?
<herostar> he's got a soft side under all that andry :3
<SayWhat> Whaaaa?!
<Shizuka> 13mmmmmmm yeah

<Hodiku> hooray! more work for winry!
<Hazard> automail is mechanical limbs

<Sumica> 00,10Well Mustang did roast his love.
<SayWhat> I only saw one ep, it was intersting

<Hazard> i stopped on 1 episode and BAM i didnt know whats happeneing!
<Kammerjunk> Or neither?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Bleach is almost over, not sure how I feel on that
<Ziltoidian> bleach has like 300 episodes
<flutter_spin> I've seen Bleach movies, and an episode here and there. Never got into it either
<RAWRity> Soul Eater can bs summed up pretty easily: Visually interesting, boring as hell from a character and plot standpoint.
<Kammerjunk> Krona is just a sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania.
<SolarBlaze> lol ikr if you dont watch them continuosly its confusing
<ScootaChicken> alright skype and BronyState, go away, I need some sleep tonight
<Sumica> 00,10almost over? last I heard it was't even halfway, and that was just last year.
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: if by "almost over" you mean "Kubo's gonna milk this last arc for at least 3 years"
<Hazard> cya ScootaChicken
<kirzstryfe> 1,3probably lol
<RAWRity> Sumica: I think you're thinking of One Piece
<kirzstryfe> 1,3creator just started on the last arc Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10that too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night ScootaChicken
<Hazard> god damn so many animes
<RAWRity> because One Piece just reached the halfway point about a year ago.
<SayWhat> Whooaa
<flutter_spin> dat mouth
<RaveBrony> :o
<Hazard> XD
<The_4th_Wall> dinner's in the nuke
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yeah, One Piece is a massive story
<SayWhat> Microwave is worse than a nuke
<herostar> falsemalarm food has 5 min.
<Hazard> lol
<RAWRity> Naruto also seems to be nearing its end.
<RaveBrony> One Piece? Dang, havent heard about that for a While now O.o
<Hazard> would it be a good idea to microwave this?
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I feel like I am catching up with stuff. I am just now halfway through Bioshock
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: FINALLY.
<SayWhat> Microwave makes your Chicken Nuggets soggy, nukes don't
<Hazard> XD
<RaveBrony> :D
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Naruto has picked up a bit the last few issues, I like how it's shifted to more action
<meh> ha
<Hazard> you BAKE zem
<The_4th_Wall> hehe
<Hazard> i bake my naruto aswell
<RAWRity> It'll be interesting what comes to take the place of Naruto and Bleach. I'm guessing Toriko and Bakuman are the manga tha'll take those spots.
<SayWhat> Don't even get me started on microwaving Tostinos
<Hazard> thats a horrible idea SayWhat
<SayWhat> 'Tis
<RAWRity> hell, Toriko basically HAS replaced Bleach in terms of weekly rankings.
<Hazard> damn
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Toriko?
<SayWhat> That's a manly chick
<LadyCanary> ...Wait a minute....ENVY?
<RAWRity> and Naruto's been hovering in the 6-10 range in the rankings lately.
<Hazard> lol hard to beleive that bitch is a giant 400 ton monster
<flutter_spin> I like anime but after Toonami left, I was left out of the loop
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: eeyup, that's envy.
<Hazard> SPOILER
<LadyCanary> Wow! I actually remembered.
<Hazard> :D
<SayWhat> S/he's flatter than kansas
<Hazard> Envy is a bitch
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: it's a manga about Eating really good food to become true men.
<RAWRity> nobody's entirely sure what gender envy is.
<Hazard> both RAWRity
*emangamer sigh...
<Hazard> both
<Sumica> 00,10both, neather.
<RAWRity> and really, considering its power, probably depends on its mood.
<Hazard> actually neither because shes an humunculous
<emangamer> dat neather
<emangamer> dat an
<SayWhat> We shall refer to Envy as... IT!
<Hazard> dat sweat
<Hazard> XD
<Dark_Horst> wouldn't that village be toast either way?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3they never really touch on the gender in brotherhood
<SayWhat> Inside the belly :O
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm thinking of doing a couple of videos
<Hazard> thats a bloody stake
<RAWRity> Fun Fact: Toriko is the only manga at the moment to have had a crossover with Dragonball Z
<meh> envy would be crona's bff
<Saturn> 08,01called Drunk Physics
<flutter_spin> tell me again what a hum..ugh, I can't even spell it
<SayWhat> Snake > Wrath
*LadyCanary giggles. Silly Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01in which i drink a load of alcohol, then (attempt to) explain some physics
<kirzstryfe> 1,3homunculus
<kirzstryfe> 1,3artificial human
<Hazard> its an artificial human
<Hazard> made through alchemy
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: artificial human created using a philosopher's stone.
<flutter_spin> test tube creations?
<flutter_spin> oh
<Hazard> Androids are artificial humans
<Saturn> 08,01who'd watch this?
<Hazard> not clones flutter_spin
<SayWhat> So Terminator is artificial?
<Hazard> idk
<SayWhat> Are you telling me Terminator is fake?
<SayWhat> Phew
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: sort of. Basically they sacrificed a bunch of living humans to make an nigh-immortal single superhuman.
<Hazard> XD
<kirzstryfe> 1,3sacrifice a few hundred human souls to put them into the result of a failed human transmutation
<emangamer> Has anypony heard of the song Emerals Sword?
<Hazard> thats pointless acually
<SayWhat> With a big tongue
<flutter_spin> a failed transmute?
<SayWhat> It's led to gold all over again!
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: a failed attempt to recreate human life.
<flutter_spin> Are there any successful?
<herostar> IH SHMIT
<herostar> OH*
<meh> panda mask
<emangamer> no...nopony?
<meh> fus ro dah
<RAWRity> flutter_spin: as of now? Nope.
<SayWhat> Nah
<Dark_Horst> he mad
<Ziltoidian> Oh me emangamer
<kirzstryfe> 1,3like with Ed and Al, they try to bring their mom back to life, end up losing Al's body, Ed's arm and leg, and they get a half-alive mass of flesh
<Ziltoidian> by rhapsody?
<emangamer> ok good.... I'm not the only one
<emangamer> Ziltoidian: yea
<meh> yol tor shul
<emangamer> Rhapsody of Fire
<Sumica> 00,10gonna give himself heart burn doing that.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if it is by rhapsody then yes
<Ziltoidian> I havdnt listen to rhapsody in a while
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: well, sort of. Al lost his EVERYTHING, and ed sacrificed his arm to bring his soul back into the armor.
<SayWhat> I wish i had superpowers :( If you could have any superpwer, what wouldit be? Mine would be Time control
<emangamer> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Emerals Sword?
<flutter_spin> ugh, the dl is lagging the stream. Maybe I should pause it
<meh> mines would be teleporting
<SayWhat> meh
<Hazard> SayWhat: maybe the ability to NOT DIE
<SayWhat> meh
<Phase4> whats this?
*Phase4 was watching something else
<Hazard> Immortality is probably the best superpower
<meh> thats nice but if you can still feel pain you might want to die
<RAWRity> I think mine would be teleportation, or flight. MAYBE invisibility, but only if I could make more than just my body explode.
<SayWhat> Exactly
<Ziltoidian> THis fullmetal alchemist brotherhood
<flutter_spin> What if you got stuck in a really deep pit, what would you do?
<RAWRity> Hazard: but is it? Then you get to watch your friends and loved ones die while you live on.
<flutter_spin> Sit around and do nothing?
<Phase4> WHatt hatateafhsdfasf
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nor really sure i have this two Emerald Sword and holy thunderforce
<Phase4> i just started watching
<SayWhat> I would want to die, otherwise i'd get bored when the world ends and there are no more ponies to entertain my ADD ridden soul
<Sumica> 00,10Sounded like he yelled FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFuck
<Phase4> why is there mr mouth chest
<emangamer> o/ For the king, for the land, for the mountains. For the green vallies where draons fly, for the glory the power to wing the black lord, I will search the Emerald Sword o/
<Hazard> RAWRity: oh well i could wait till the future to time travel and get zem back!
<Hazard> AHA

<flutter_spin> ugh. No matter what, my brain still reads col-o-nel, instead of ker-nel
<Phase4> this show is strange and confusing, i;ma go watch that other thing
*Hazard Brohoofs TOY_PON3
<kidzrul434> I never been to japan :(
<SayWhat> DAT panda
<Saturn> 08,01why does al have a tiny panda?
*TOY_PON3 brohoofs Hazard back
<LadyCanary> Pandy :3 :3 :3
<LadyCanary> So cuuute~
<TOY_PON3> Saturn: He's a boss
<meh> because tiny pandas rock
<Dark_Horst> YOU DONT SAY
<kirzstryfe> 1,3why wouldn't he have a tiny panda?
<TOY_PON3> ^
<SayWhat> Panda Express is probably my favorite place in the world
<Saturn> 08,01urgh, i do not like what i've seen of Brotherhood so far
<Hazard> its a part of a side story
<Sumica> 00,10He picked it up after the fought with the little girl it belongs to.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's hard to get into it unless you see it from the start
<SayWhat> If i had a choice to go anywhere right now, it'd be panda express
<Phase4> ohai Saturn
<valoreins> morning.. wow FMA brotherhood...
<Phase4> and kirzstryfe
<meh> only reason he wouldnt have a tiny panda would be if he had a tiny pony
<SayWhat> mmmmnumnum
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:)
<Phase4> and valoreins
<kidzrul434> I wish the hub would just be My Little Pony for 24 hours
<Saturn> 08,01the animation is better than the original anime, but the music isn't, and the way it's generally carried off carried so much less emotional impact
<SayWhat> ^
<TOY_PON3> Roy Mustang is best pony
<SayWhat> I don't the Hub though :(
<flutter_spin> that would be too much mlp
<otakon> a'ww man!
<Sumica> 00,10I want chilli dogs
<meh> indeed
<Hazard> the panda is the best friend/pet of the little girl who is looking for the Philosiphers stone and get immortality to her country and get her clan to be the next boss clan
<LadyCanary> Because TINY MINISKIRTS
<Phase4> SayWhat: i dont the hub either
<otakon> I'm missing FMAB!
<otakon> argh
<Hazard> WHOA!
<TOY_PON3> Damn Gluttony

<meh> dat envy
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: not really, no
<herostar> crazy
<RAWRity> Yeah, brotherhood's biggest issue is maintaining tone. They tend to wreck dramatic scenes with comic relief, or the music just...doesn't work.
<TOY_PON3> Envy is best brony
*otakon kicks off kirzstryfe towards Saturn
<meh> envy was always my favorite
<LadyCanary> Oh the horrid cosplays Ive seen of Envy.

<Hazard> kirzstryfe: why?

<RAWRity> LadyCanary: odds are, they were guys.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hard to explain, just scary
<Hazard> hey Saturn atleast its not that moon video with Pinkie and Luna and Vinyl singing on the moon
<MirrorImage> dat Square Enix
<TOY_PON3> kirzstryfe: Don't get too detailed I don't wanna image it in my mind
<kidzrul434> I was actually back from watching Family Guy
<Hazard> Avatar The Last Airbender was a big let down
<meh> nom nom nom
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: It actually doesnt look half bad
<valoreins> TOY_PON3: then that would be like the "transformers" case again...
<LadyCanary> And flutter_spin: IT NEVER HAPPENED.
<Saturn> 08,01Hazard: so very much
*TOY_PON3 cringes
<flutter_spin> At least Legend of Korrah will be awesome
<Hazard> how come you need 5 tough muscular earth benders to move 1 tiny bould!
<Hazard> er
<Hazard> WTF!
<kidzrul434> I hate everything with live action CG because they rape everything
<TOY_PON3> flutter_spin: Live action DBZ you say?
*TOY_PON3 hides knife behind back
<flutter_spin> lol toy. It was beyond horrible.
<RAWRity> You know, I kinda can't wait for the train wreck that the Live Action Akira movie is sure to be.
<LadyCanary> RAWRity:
<kirzstryfe> 1,3if you're talking about the US live action DBZ they made, that was bad
<valoreins> there's a live action DBZ? i thought that was just a copy...
<LadyCanary> THEY CANCELLED IT RAWRity
<TOY_PON3> Eww live action Akira...
<LadyCanary> :3 its not gonna happen.
<KwakLad> So when did gluttony learn laser gobbling?
*TOY_PON3 throws up
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: you say that.
<LadyCanary> It's true.
<RAWRity> and then it'll happen.
<LadyCanary> It's not going to.
<TOY_PON3> It just did thanks LC
<LadyCanary> Im dead serious.
<RAWRity> because fucking Hollywood.
<kidzrul434> see ya bronies I gotta go do somethin else

<TOY_PON3> kirzstryfe: O U
