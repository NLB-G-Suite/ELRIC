<Dman> This episode may be what is known in the TV industry as a "bottle episode," a simple story taking place almost entirely in the same location and with a minimal cast. These are commonly used to save money and help stretch the budget allocated for a season of episodes. In this case, only three voice actresses perform and almost everything happens within Twiligh

*Dman RANDOM PONY TRIVIA IN RECOGNITION OF THE GREAT AND POWERFUL SILVERSCREEN: Zecora was, but is no longer, the word used for zebra by the Oromo people of east Africa.[1] Zecora's chant in Bridle Gossip is actually gibberish. The crew didn't have time or resources to hire a Swahili translator, so they asked the voice actress to improvise.

*Dman RANDOM PONY TRIVIA IN RECOGNITION OF THE GREAT AND POWERFUL SILVERSCREEN: Zecora's cutie mark seems to be a reference to the 1994 Disney animated movie, The Lion King. It could also be a swirling cauldron, with flames licking out from underneath, indicating a talent for brew-making. Zecora is the ONLY non- pony so far to have a cutie mark.

*Dman PONY TRIVIA FOR THE ONE AND ONLY SILVERSCREEN: The episode title might reference the title of a classic book called Call of the Wild, in which a dog has an internal struggle against his domestication in order to find itself as how he was meant to be. This mirrors the plot where Apple Bloom must go through personal struggles in order to find out who she re
*Dman ally is inside. The title also resembles the common phrase "call of duty", possibly referring to Apple Bloom's obligation to find her cutie mark.

*Dman PONY TRIVIA FOR THE ONE AND ONLY SILVERSCREEN: Apple Bloom's colors may have been both inspired from Sun Shimmer, a Generation 3 Earth Pony and Sunburst, a Generation 1 Mountain Boy Pony.

*Dman PONY TRIVIA FUR DIE SILVASCREEN: The episode title is a pun on the phrase fair weather friends, which references people who are only your friend when they need you (when weather is 'fair') and will abandon you otherwise.

*Dman PONY TRIVIA BECAUSE PONY TRIVIA: Rarity's design evolved from that of Sparkler and Glory, ponies from the original (or G1) line of My Little Pony characters. She looks like the unicorn Majesty, who came with the G1 castle set, except her hair is purple instead of blue. When Hasbro lost the rights to nearly all the original ponies names, Faust combined Glo
*Dman ry's color scheme and Sparkler's personality and appearance with the name of a G3 pony, creating Friendship is Magic's Rarity. Her name is based on the word Rarity, meaning something that is rare or scarce.

<Kimundi> This is a trowup of everything but a kitchen sink! *cue actual kitchensink*
*Dman PONY TRIVIA BECAUSE PONY TRIVIA: Hoity Toity's line "everything but the kitchen sink" while commenting on the disaster dresses. This is an old idiom meaning that almost everything was used, whether it belongs or not.
<jeremiah> WHAT THE FUCK????
<FirelanderX> Sink?
<Nopony> mishmash

<[Ger]Brony1> What's the sink doing there anyways?

*Dman PONY TRIVIA BECAUSE PONY TRIVIA: The sequence where Rarity has locked herself in her room and says "I want to be alone" is a likely reference to actress Greta Garbo, who is associated with the phrase.
<DragonRage> I vant to be alone!
<ValtheJean> ~Why oh why wont she come out of the closet?~

<FancyCat2008> Guys, A and B movies refer to how studios used to market films. A movies were the big budget affairs marketed directly to theaters. B movies were lower budget films offered in "Buy One, Get One Free" deals to movie chains. If you bought an "A" movie, you'd get a "B" movie to show too.
