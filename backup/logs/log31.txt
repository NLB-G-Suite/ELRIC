<Nick> hi skylands
<Skylands> 10Did you go to the mall tour for those Reshiram/Zekrom plushies?
<Nick> no I got them online
<Nick> didn't you know the UK version was ABSOLOUTELY RUBBISH Dx
<Skylands> 10I heard it was
<Nick> it was just stripped down to the bare game demo and one person in costume
<Skylands> 10But wow, I bet they were expensive online
<Skylands> 10Amazon's price listings were up to $90 for each at one point
*Skylands checks on that now
<Nick> that was it, and the pathetic thing was they were going around the country with just a game demo after the game was released
<Skylands> 10XD
<Skylands> 10Did you still go?
<Nick> and I used some of my birthday money sky for those earlier in the year, plus I used a 10% discount
<Skylands> 10Oh
<Nick> no :| it wasn't worth the travel money! and I had the game!
<Skylands> 10I really wanted to go, but my parents weren't keen on the idea of having to drive several hours away
<Skylands> 10and then having to drive back, which almost took up the full day
<Nick> I know I remember :(
<Skylands> 10Plus my sister had something planned, can't remember what though
<eXAKR> http://translationparty.com/#9435343
<Nick> I wish I coulda been in the US at that time I could got all that stuff for much cheaper too
<Skylands> 10Yeah, more than half the price cheaper
<Nick> yeah...

<Skylands> 10Well, my mother always told me I should eat it when I feel sick (in the pukey way) because it's easy on your stomach
<Skylands> 10But when I'm sick like that - I don't want to eat at all
<Hooh54> 4Uck
<Hooh54> 4Me neither
<prince-dari> LOL. Even more adult women dressed like ponies.

<Hooh54> 4How are you? :3
<prince-dari> Possible MLP-transformers crossover? God no.
<prince-dari> Transformers suck.
<Hooh54> 4^ Yes
<Nick> no
<Hooh54> 4I only like one
<Nick> and PLEASE don't tell me the hub is considering it? o0
<Hooh54> 4I think they are
<Nick> o_____e
<Hooh54> 4Even Ponies are better than that robot stuff
<Hooh54> 4Even the MOVIES suck
<Skylands> 10I dislike Transformers, but I gotta say they're less annoying than MLP
<Hooh54> 4Some episodes of pony annoy me to no end
<Espeon> 06Lol, you never hear about transformers everywhere at least
<Espeon> 06:P
<prince-dari> This is real, it's hung in a library in the USA.
<Nick> MLP was (sort of) in hiatus while Transformers kept going strong in both the toy/animation departments
<Hooh54> 4http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/135/1/9/Chibi_Espeon_by_PokeHihi.png
<Hooh54> 4Oh and dat Twilight poster
<Nick> contrary to popular belief, the transformers toy line never ceased produciton, beast wars was so well written it garnered a few TV awards and the new millenium saw the anime series (armade, etc) bring it back to mainline media...the movies propelled it back to popularity again
<prince-dari> Well MLP won best TV show. :>
<Hooh54> 4Thankfully
<Nick> since when?
<prince-dari> I think it was for 2010, I'll try to find it.
<prince-dari> Hmm.

<lightumbreon|sick> or a floofpotion
<Espeon> 06o-o
<Hooh54> 4Wouldn't a floofpotion make you floofier than you already are?
<Espeon> 06Hyper Potion sounds potentially punny
<lightumbreon|sick> do i look like someone who cares if he had more floof than now? :3
<Lakorv> Hyper potions, curing your hyper kids since 1992.

<Chimera> 04butbutbut
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, the learning channel
<Chimera> 04if it were perfect timing
<Chimera> 04that'd be me saying AE's mom is stupif
<Chimera> 04stupid
<Chimera> 04which I didn't say
<Chimera> 04;w;
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03TLC has some stuff about Christmas lights :D

<drfsupercenter> 03it's called Crazy Christmas Lights
<drfsupercenter> 03it's cool
<drfsupercenter> 03I generally don't hate any TV stations
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like
<drfsupercenter> 03Lifetime, television for idiots
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03they show Unsolved Mysteries :D
<Chimera> 04I'll totally shift through 20 hours of crap to see LIGHTAS
<Chimera> 04*LIGHTS
<Chimera> 04and heh
<Chimera> 04true
<Chimera> 04the thing is, the majority of networks have ONE good show on air
<Chimera> 04and the rest suck.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why you use a TV guide
<drfsupercenter> 03I search by show, niot channel;
<drfsupercenter> 03-i
<Chimera> 04That's why I don't watch TV
<HyperMetalLugia> ^ True
<Chimera> 04No seriously I haven't really watched TV in a long time XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I rarely watch TV
<Chimera> 04^ :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nothing decent is on TV these days
<Chimera> 04THANK you AE
<Chimera> 04They need to make something that's GOOD to watch
<Angel_Espeon> 13nowadays I only watch TV for Phineas and Ferb, and even that is a show I can watch on youtube anytime xD
<drfsupercenter> 03EW THAT SHOW
<Chimera> 04Though I love some shows like Ghost Hunters
<drfsupercenter> 03there's plenty of good stuff on TV
<drfsupercenter> 03you just have to know when to look
<Chimera> 04lol P&F
<drfsupercenter> 03my usual schedule is
<drfsupercenter> 03Judge Judy from 4-5
<drfsupercenter> 03then Scrubs from 5-6

<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<Hooh54> 4Muffin
<Hipster_Brony> 8more than suspicious
<Ghosties> 4I was right all along
<Hipster_Brony> 8the second i saw the OP, i knew it was a scam
<Ghosties> 4All it took was BachelorDash posting that image and I was more than convinced
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was OP saying he was from northern europe that did it for me
<Ghosties> 4Sweden
<Hipster_Brony> 8they get free health care, so he wouldnt have had to pay for med
<Hipster_Brony> 8meds*
<Hooh54> 4Brb, lunch
<Ghosties> 4They have free health care in Sweeden
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Ghosties> 4What a fucking prick
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, like i said in my post, on the internet, its guilty until proven innocent
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i do feel bad for the people that got suckered in
<Ghosties> 4He got money from us
<Ghosties> 4Sure, he didn't get the total amount he was asking for, but he still got money from fellow bronies
<Ghosties> 4This is easily the most despicable thing I've seen /co/ do in a long time
<Hipster_Brony> 8its also a felony
<Hipster_Brony> 8i hope he goes to jail
<Ghosties> 4Agreed
<HyperMetalLugia> 1pm Hooh?
<Hipster_Brony> 8im sure the mods reported his IP
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure others reported his email as well
<Ghosties> 4We have his alias apparently
<Ghosties> 4I actually want to raid /co/ now. I know it wouldn't be the right thing to do, but I seriously wanna punch the guy in the face
<Hipster_Brony> 8dont raid
<Hipster_Brony> 8looked up the u.s. code
<Hipster_Brony> 8he would be guilty of wire fraud, which has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I just literally saw your post
<Ghosties> 4And I wonder if he's still posting in there
<Hipster_Brony> 8i reported my post to make sure the mods see it too
<Ghosties> 4I'm finally in /co/, lurking to see if the douche is gloating
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Aeroslash02)03WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Skylands> 10Hi Aeroslash
<Aeroslash> heya Skylands
<Aeroslash> how's things?
<Skylands> 10Fine, you?
<Hooh54> 4Heya guys
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont even want to go to 4chan
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai Aero
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Hooh :P
<Ghosties> 4I feel dirty
<Hooh54> 4Thank you :3
<Ghosties> 4And I didn't even donate
<Aeroslash> I've been great, thank for asking ^^
<Aeroslash> *thanks
<Skylands> 10No prob
<Hipster_Brony> 8remember the other day when i said i didnt hate 4chan, i just preferred ponychan?
<Hipster_Brony> 8well now i hate 4chan
<Hipster_Brony> 8Soldier text wall
<Hipster_Brony> 8as usual, pretty much said exactly what i was thinking
<Hipster_Brony> 8man, fuck
<Hipster_Brony> 8i get back from work and this is the 1st goddamn thing i see on ponychan
<Ghosties> 4Actually, the thread that started the attack has a lot of /co/mrades being pissed off at Faceless
<Ghosties> 4And Faceless is the one who did the scheme
<Ghosties> 4They also came to our thread and apologized for his bullshit
<Hipster_Brony> 8i saw that
<Ghosties> 4And of course Soldier decides to intervene, because he feels he can save the day
*Hooh54 4sits in the silence
<Hipster_Brony> 8im always ok with Soldier posting his text walls
<Ghosties> 4Bleh
<Hipster_Brony> 8you dont like Soldier?
<Ghosties> 4No
<Hipster_Brony> 8really?
<Ghosties> 4Nope
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes one of my favorite posters
<Ghosties> 4He's the biggest attention horse on the site
<Angel_Espeon> 13why does this amuse me so much http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Li7gRh6go&feature=related
<Hipster_Brony> 8i see no problem with that

<Hipster_Brony> 8im a huge attention horse too
<Hipster_Brony> 8and his posts are usually very good
<Hipster_Brony> 8and the advice he gives is top notch
<Espeon> 06Lol
<Espeon> 06because it's simple and unexpected c:
<Ghosties> 4Ponychan is an imageboard, and on imageboards people post in short posts because we're trying to have discussions. What Soldier does is essentially post a page's worth of stuff that then swiftly diverts attention away from whatever people are talking about to showering praise to him for saying some pretty words and seeming humble
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 12 minutes
*Angel_Espeon 13floofs Espeon
<SilverSonic> wut about the rest of us
<SilverSonic> we want floof too o3o
*Espeon counter-floofs Angel_Espeon
<Hipster_Brony> 8i see no problem with that, because the stuff he writes is usually worth talking about
<Hipster_Brony> 8and its not like hes writing the praise for himself, thats coming completely from the community
<Angel_Espeon> 13SS, if you want to be floofed you must beg for it ;3
*Angel_Espeon 13runs
*SilverSonic begs for AE's floof o3o
<Ghosties> 4If you think so, I can't believe that he basically took hundreds of arguments and debates between fellow ponychanners, pretty much copy pasted the entire thing into a post, organized it, and slapped his name up on the post and got it archived
*Angel_Espeon 13floofs SilverSonic
<Angel_Espeon> 13good boy ;3
<Ghosties> 4And people cherished HIM
<Ghosties> 4Not others who actually came up with it
<SilverSonic> <3
<SilverSonic> X3
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know him well enough that it sounded like those were his own words and thoughts
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, N is starting shit on /oat/ now
<Hipster_Brony> 8so much drama todau
<Hipster_Brony> 8today*

<Ghosties> 4And Faceless is just lapping it up
<Espeon> 06o.o;
<Hooh54> 4This calls for a floof fight
<Espeon> 06And reminds me of that floofy Lugia and Ho-Oh picture.
<Hipster_Brony> 8eh, whatever
*Hooh54 4grabs both the Espeons and throws them at someone

<Espeon> 06whoa at first I didn't see the second cat
<Skylands> 10Doesn't look like they brushed their cat very well
<Hooh54> 4DOUBLE FLOOF ALL THE WAY
<Ghosties> 4And, unfortunately, people on ponychan are just gonna let it be
<MisterBristle> hey guys
<Ghosties> 4Seriously, people are gonna tolerate this
<Ghosties> 4Hello Bristle
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi bristle
<MisterBristle> 7Just thought I'de check in, luckly your here, can't attend on Friday, it's my fathers birthday and I have to do stuff with him
<Ghosties> 4Alright, Bristle

<MisterBristle> 7cool
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, did you catch the drama on /oat/?
<MisterBristle> 7The dontation thread that was a scam or something?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<MisterBristle> 7I saw the thread, but didnt read it
<Hipster_Brony> 8and now N is starting shit about furries
<MisterBristle> 7who is N?
<Hipster_Brony> 8basically what happened is somepony from /co/ pretended he was sick, got $90 in donations before he was exposed
<Ghosties> 4I got flak for calling foul on the OP, but people WERE WHINING ABOUT WHY I DIDN'T TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUST HIMMMMMMMMM
<Hipster_Brony> 8N is basically a resident parasprite
<MisterBristle> 7Wow, jesus /oat/ but I'lle be back got to go to a dentist appoinment
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes a fairly regular user, but hes kind of a dick
<Ghosties> 4At least N is OUR resident dick
<Hipster_Brony> 8alright, see ya later bristle
<Ghosties> 4I don't think he'd stoop to the cockstain level that Faceless did
<Hipster_Brony> 8no, he isnt that big of a dick
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, btw, was sprinkles able to get the stream working without lag?
<Ghosties> 4It's like Hal Rocker, I don't like the guy but he doesn't cause trouble
<Ghosties> 4Much
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, he figured it out
<Ghosties> 4The video's a little fuzzy, but there's no lag
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Hipster_Brony> 8cool beans
<HyperMetalLugia> I love that picture ;p
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, im gonna send out an email to DCD, why did you want him in here tonight?
<HyperMetalLugia> And terrible
<HyperMetalLugia> Floof gone wrong
<Ghosties> 4So he can give advice to Sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4About the pre-show and post-show
<Ghosties> 4And also about where to get the movies
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, im gonna ask him if he can drop by to talk about astray
<Ghosties> 4Sounds good
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz i think it would be better if we all told him how we felt individually
<Skylands> 10<insert more silence here>
<Hipster_Brony> 8instead of me just writing "none of the other mods like him"
<Angel_Espeon> 13!silence
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"

<Hooh54> 4How dare you nom in front of me
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm gonna be havnig feesh fingers for dinner
<Hipster_Brony> 8but giving full op to a non-brony who is an obvious parasprite will not end well
<Angel_Espeon> 13inb4 someone takes that out of context
<Ghosties> 4Jesus, I actually finally realize that despite just how much I dislike Ponychan it will always be better than 4chan simply because of Faceless' actions
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD

<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 5Delibird.
<Skylands> 10Not until you mentioned it, nope :P
<Skylands> 10Iceburd
<Hipster_Brony> 8you dislike Ponychan?
<Ghosties> 4I dislike the way how the majority of people on Ponychan throw out common sense for love and tolerance
<Ghosties> 4That scam thread is my evidence
<Ghosties> 4But despite all that, I realize that Ponychan is the more mature site because we haven't stooped to 4chan's level yet
<Hooh54> 4Santaburd
<Hipster_Brony> 8i find the love and tolerance aspect refreshing, even though people shouldnt have been as trusting as they were
<Skylands> 10I misread that for Satanburd
<Hooh54> 4Fear me, I'm the devilburd
*Skylands shows no sign of fear
<Hooh54> 4Delvibird used Evil Delivery!
<Ghosties> 4God, and then 4chan is completely devoid of common sense too
<Ghosties> 4Because it's OBVIOUSLY so much more goddamn adult and mature to steal someone's money
<Hipster_Brony> 8people are stupid
<Hipster_Brony> 8its been 2 days since i put a thread on /meta/ arguing that /oat/ and /chat/ should be combined, or at least reconfigured

<SilverSonic> EWWWWWWWWW PONY URL
<Hooh54> 4Listen to it
<NightSeas> 12Hi SilverSonic
<Hipster_Brony> 8Pretty sure Nature Blossom just got banhammered
<Hipster_Brony> 8what is with all the hate and drama on /oat/ today?
<Ghosties> 4Faceless
<Ghosties> 4Faceless honestly started a shit storm is that is still festering long after he left
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<SirSprinkles> 6I dislike hate and drama.
<Ghosties> 4Why was Nature Blossom banned?
<Hipster_Brony> 8me too, bro, me too
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont think he was now, actually, but he had a bunch of post deletions
<Hipster_Brony> 8he might get banned yet though
<Ghosties> 4What for?
<Hipster_Brony> 8he told Angel The Bunny to "go eat shit and die"
<SilverSonic> I dont listen to pony crap Hooh
<Hipster_Brony> 8and is generally writing a lot of very angry stuff in that Haackula thread
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Ghosties> 4Angel is a complete douche, it's hard not to get angry at him
<Hooh54> 4I c
<Ghosties> 4I mean, I agree with a lot of what he says but he's even worse that I am at social ettiquette
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, it was based on this screenshot: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130817260132.png
<SirSprinkles> 6I've never really read any of Angel's posts.
<SilverSonic> if its crap i dont listen to it, ponies are crap
<SilverSonic> ;P
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah shit, thats tiny
<SirSprinkles> 6But I know Haack has anything and everything coming to him.
<SilverSonic> get the picture im drawing :P
<SirSprinkles> 6You can pop it out, silly.
<Hipster_Brony> 8basically Haackula posted a screenshot of Angel The Bunny congratulating Faceless
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<NightSeas> 12Floof~
<SirSprinkles> 6mfw
<SirSprinkles> 6:/
<Ghosties> 4But Angel is apparently trying to reason with Ponychan that he's not defecting or some shit
<SirSprinkles> 6I say if he wants to defect, let him.
<SirSprinkles> 6He'll be back anyway.
<SirSprinkles> 6They always come back.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its like i said in that one thread after the Cupcakes shitstorm, if people dont want to be here, they dont have to
<Hipster_Brony> 8they should consider whether or not this is the right community for them
<Ghosties> 4And that thread is still mocking us
<Hipster_Brony> 8*shrug* like i said, i dont really care what 4chan thinks of us
<SirSprinkles> 6Which thread is this?
*SirSprinkles 6is forgetful
<Hipster_Brony> 8thread in /co/ about the scam
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh.
<SirSprinkles> 6I saw that.
<Ghosties> 4It's a new thread now. Faceless decided to make a new thread and an anon is mocking the ponychan mods over in meta
<Ghosties> 4He linked the thread and all
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, Background got banned for 24+ hours for posting a parody of the scam thread asking people to donate to animal shelters
<Ghosties> 4Too slow, Hip : /
<Hipster_Brony> 8no ones mocking the mods in that thread that i've seen though
<Ghosties> 4It's a new thread Faceless made
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh look at the pretty thread in meta.
<Ghosties> 4Someone is mocking the mods in it
<Hipster_Brony> 8send me a link to the /co/ thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8the faceless thread
<Ghosties> 4We don't need to keep this shit going, Hip.
<Hipster_Brony> 8no no
<Ghosties> 4They're trying to stop talking about it
<Hipster_Brony> 8i want to see if its something i should bring to the attention of the mods
<SirSprinkles> 6...My muffin is gone.
<SirSprinkles> 6Good thing I have three more~
<Ghosties> 4Ahaha. Look at the ponychan mod staff failing some more.
<Ghosties> 4That's literally all it was
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, i am jelly
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh ok, i misunderstood
*Espeon yawns
<Hipster_Brony> 8i thought you were saying faceless had posted a thread where he was encouraging people to go make fun of the mods on /meta/
<Ghosties> 4Sorry if I worded it weirdly, he wasn't doing an outright attack or anything. Just pointing and laughing, and even then he was reprimanded by a fellow /co/mrade for trying to stir more shit up
<Hooh54> 4Y hallo thar
<SirSprinkles> 6>worded weirdly
<SirSprinkles> 6>half the problems on the internet
<SirSprinkles> 6>i.e. last night with Peanut and !!Scootaloo
<Angel_Espeon> 13made me yawn :<
*Espeon hugs Angel_Espeon c:
<Espeon> 06better?
*Angel_Espeon 13hugs back :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Much better~
<Ghosties> 4Let's not go into that, I still feel sore over that bullshit
<Hooh54> 4Floofhug
<Hipster_Brony> 8wait, what happened with Peanut and !!Scootaloo?
<Hipster_Brony> 8just type it out, i will be afk for about 10 mins
<Ghosties> 4Hold on
<Ghosties> 4Hold on
<Ghosties> 4Hold on
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Hipster_Brony> 8but ill read when i get back
<Ghosties> 4Everybody stop talking for a moment
<Espeon> 06:3
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 18 minutes
<NightSeas> 12Hi Angel Espeon
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai :3
<Hooh54> 4!Angel_Espeon
<Hooh54> 4SCRIPT
<Hooh54> 4Y U GIVE ME NO ESPEON
<Espeon> 06No sharing~
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3c
*Skylands shares her bree self with someone
<HyperMetalLugia> With me? :P
<Skylands> 10Sure
<Espeon> 06-eons everywhere
<HyperMetalLugia> Good :3
<Ghosties> 4Okay
<SirSprinkles> 6...?
<Ghosties> 4But seriously, Peanut pissed me off last night
<Ghosties> 4I felt disrespected
<SirSprinkles> 6It wasn't really Peanut.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was legitimately !!Scootaloo.
<Ghosties> 4What?
<SirSprinkles> 6BlazingStarshine IS !!Scootaloo
<Hooh54> 4!Espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Angel_Espeon for 14 more minutes
<Hooh54> 4Nuuuu
<SirSprinkles> 6She just said she was trolling to try to keep people off of her. Since people aren't really supposed to know.
<Hooh54> 4Purple cats are the best
<Ghosties> 4Wait, you just said Peanut was !!Scootaloo but now you're saying Blazing was !!Scootaloo
<SirSprinkles> 6...Peanut is not !!Scootaloo.
<Angel_Espeon> 13;3
<Ghosties> 4Read what you said up
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm saying Peanut didn't really do anything wrong.
<SirSprinkles> 6>worded weird
<Hooh54> 4i even spent a week getting a global link espie
<Ghosties> 4All I know is that I felt absolutely disrespected by both her and Peanut
<Ghosties> 4I felt threatened, and that's not fucking fair
<SirSprinkles> 6It was quite rude.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm still waiting for mine |D
<Espeon> 06It's totally worth it.
<Espeon> 06Insert pun about magically bouncing here.
<Ghosties> 4Seriously, !!Scootaloo can go fuck herself
<SirSprinkles> 6She lost major respect points with me last night.
<Hooh54> 4Magic Bounce + Espeon = yes
<Ghosties> 4I've never once had an issue with the mods, but she completely lost any respect from me
<Espeon> 06That is a pretty fun ability though.
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<SirSprinkles> 6I usually like the mods. The fact that she went and did that was just absolutely... no.
<Espeon> 06Ok
<Ghosties> 4But Peanut exacerbated her attitude
<Ghosties> 4Both acted like total douchebags to me, and while I can't say anything to !!Scootaloo about it, you better believe Peanut's gonna get a textful from me
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd agree he did go overboard with it, but it seemed more like he was just poking fun.
<SirSprinkles> 6I could see how it could hurt feelings though.
<Ghosties> 4Maybe he was just having fun, but no one apologized to me
<Ghosties> 4Neither of them did
<Hooh54> 4Bye1
<MisterBristle> Alright I'm back!
<Hooh54> 4*!
<Ghosties> 4WB Bristle
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey Bristle.
<MisterBristle> 7I have one thing to say, Fuck the Dentist
<SirSprinkles> 6That is a statement I agree wholeheartedly with.
<Ghosties> 4Oh shit
<Ghosties> 4Now N really is asking for a banhammer
<SirSprinkles> 6...though I'm sure if I went to the dentist any time soon I'd get so many fillings that I'd have enough metal in me to qualify as being an android.
<MisterBristle> 7Lol I saw N's thread, Obvious troll is obvious
<Hipster_Brony> 8yo, what exactly happened?
<Ghosties> 4N is asking to be banhammered
<Ghosties> 4Seriously
<SirSprinkles> 6Parasprite detected.
<SirSprinkles> 6I need to find a tuba.
<Ghosties> 4Go to /oat/, Hip
<Ghosties> 4You'll see it
<Hipster_Brony> 8i see the N thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8what was the peanut/!!scootaloo thing about
<SirSprinkles> 6The N thread is in /oat/? I'm looking at one in /meta/
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Kosoveon :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, my feelings on the N thread are in my post
<Ghosties> 4I can't speak to you about it, Hip, otherwise I'll be banhammered
<Hipster_Brony> 8tell me here
<Hipster_Brony> 8mods cant reach you here
<MisterBristle> 7If he wants to fight and parasprite, why not got to /co/?
<SirSprinkles> 6We found out who !!Scootaloo is outside the modtag.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, she told us, rather.
<Kosoveon> hai Angel_Espeon :3
*Kosoveon flooooofs
<SirSprinkles> 6Then she decided to tell us she was trolling us and wasn't really !!Scootaloo.
*Angel_Espeon 13is floofed o3o
<Ghosties> 4She threatened me
<SirSprinkles> 6Obvious !!Scootaloo was obvious, though.
<Ghosties> 4And acted like a complete douche and disrespected me
<Hipster_Brony> 8I have very mixed feelings on !!Scootaloo
<Ghosties> 4And Peanut exacerbated her attitude
<Ghosties> 4And pissed me off more
<Hipster_Brony> 8sometimes he/she posts good or funny things, sometimes he/she is a complete asshole
<Hipster_Brony> 8same deal with !!Twilight
<Hipster_Brony> 8the other mods i like a lot
<Ghosties> 4Listen, if you read the text log from last night you'd see Scootaloo was acting like a total fucking bitch
<Espeon> 06Floof chain reaction
*Espeon makes a generator taking advantage of this
*Espeon millionaire
*Kosoveon guinea pig
*Kosoveon sad
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, i believe you
*Angel_Espeon 13happyface
<MisterBristle> 7Jeez Ghosties, she must have really fucked with you
*Hooh54 4shaves Espeons for floof
<Ghosties> 4She pissed me the fuck off, Bristle. I have never felt disrespected by a mod or from Ponychan but she changed that real goddamn quick
<Angel_Espeon> 13;-;
<SirSprinkles> 6She was being quite rude.
<Espeon> 06That's illegal.
<Hipster_Brony> 8what was she saying
<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Hipster_Brony> 8paraphrased
<MisterBristle> 7Yeah, what did she say
<SirSprinkles> 6That she would ban us if we told anypony her identity.
*Hooh54 4goes to jail for Espeon shaving
<SirSprinkles> 6Hence why I haven't said.
<Hooh54> 4!Pokemon
<Ghosties> 4It went beyond that though
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 12Audino.
<SirSprinkles> 6Even though SHE told US.
<Ghosties> 4She was a complete prick about it
<Hipster_Brony> 8but wait, how did you find out?
<SirSprinkles> 6She told us.
<Hipster_Brony> 8was it on a thread?
<SirSprinkles> 6Flat out told us.
*Hooh54 4gets out of jail with Audino powers
<Ghosties> 4Because Peanut let it slip
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope. In here.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, ok
<Espeon> 06space jail
<Ghosties> 4I found out from Peanut
<Ghosties> 4Who had mentioned having tabs on three mods earlier in the night
*Kosoveon unshaves Angel_Espeon using deus ex machina powers
<SirSprinkles> 6I found my tuba, btw.
<Ghosties> 4And then spoke to Scoots as if she were a mod and I deduced from there
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 10Groudon.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i cant entirely blame her for that, but she shouldnt have been an ass about it
<HyperMetalLugia> Again
*Hooh54 4gets out of space with Groudon powers
<SirSprinkles> 6He specifically said "You, Spike, and ..." when listing mods.
<HyperMetalLugia> Why
<HyperMetalLugia> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 8Riolu.
<Espeon> 06!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Espeon, you are a 4Tauros.
<Skylands> 10Riolu :3
*Angel_Espeon 13is infinitely floofy to begin with
<MisterBristle> 7So on a lighter note, how bout that dude who changed his name to Rainbow Dash
*Chimera yawns
<Angel_Espeon> 13!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Angel_Espeon, you are a 8Timburr.
<Chimera> 04I took a NAP
<Espeon> 06Infinite floof finite volume
<Hipster_Brony> 8because i think the mods can get fired if they disclose their identities
<Ghosties> 4So basically when I figured it out, Scootaloo threatened me and was a complete douche about it EVEN AFTER I specifically told her I wouldn't blather her identity to Ponychan
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 9Grovyle.
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 14Pinsir.
<Skylands> 10Yay
<HyperMetalLugia> Cool :3
*Chimera wtfs at self
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 5Parasect.
<Espeon> 06What
<Chimera> 04Guys I took a 3 hour nap
<Chimera> 04at 3:20
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Chimera> 04PM x.x
<Espeon> 06lazy
<SilverSonic> lololololololololololol
<HyperMetalLugia> Creepy
<Hooh54> 4I once got an Espeon, it was screencapped
<Espeon> 06I did too, and it was in purrple. But it's in logs somewhere.
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 10Vespiquen.
<SirSprinkles> 6She was a douche to me even after I said I really didn't care who mods were outside their modtags.
<Espeon> 06Intentional misspelling
<Espeon> 06Or rather, what the real spelling should be
<Espeon> 06:D
*Espeon ~
<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
*SilverSonic ~~
<Hooh54> 4"Purrpul"
<Ghosties> 4And Peanut basically backed her up with the same shitty attitude
<HyperMetalLugia> Sillyspeons
<Hooh54> 4Purrrrrrrrrrr
<Ghosties> 4I had never seen Peanut act like a prick, but he did last night
<MisterBristle> 7If Peanut gets on the Mumble at some point, he is getting a verbal fist
*Angel_Espeon 13purrs
<Kosoveon> as floof approaches infinity, Angel Espeon approaches 1
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 14Braviary.
<Hipster_Brony> 8what is it with peanut and the mods?
<MisterBristle> 7FROM MY MOUTH
<Hipster_Brony> 8he has a weirdly close relationship with them
<SirSprinkles> 6FLUTEROLL SUCCESSFUL
<Hipster_Brony> 8PEANUT IS !!CELESTIA
<Espeon> 06Get lost in floof vortex-day is best day
<Espeon> 06Yeah
<MisterBristle> 7WHAT!
<MisterBristle> 7!?!?!?!?
<Hipster_Brony> 8no
*Espeon unleashes Katamari Flareon
<Hipster_Brony> 8im pretty sure !!Celestia said he didnt post regularly
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, i think peanut is still in high school, theres no way he would be qualified to run a site
<SirSprinkles> 6Aww... the silly parasprite isn't responding to my post.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkle, where did u fluteroll?
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 5Marowak.
<Hooh54> 4AGAIN
<SirSprinkles> 6GET thread.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ah
<MisterBristle> 7Maybe Peanut just talks to the mods, or knew one or two of them before they were mods?
<SirSprinkles> 6The person it was intended for got the reference, too. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I talk to mods, they're not my friends.
<SirSprinkles> 6I talk to like, 3 of them on ponychan on a regular basis.
<Ghosties> 4Peanut has the mods on tab
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 13Bayleef.
<Ghosties> 4SO I guess he's friends with them or something
<SirSprinkles> 6Exactly. I can't go that far.
<Hooh54> 4!POKEMON
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 12Tropius.
<MisterBristle> 7Speculating is hard
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know a little bit about the mods
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know !!derpy lives in england
<MisterBristle> 7ENGLAND!?!?!
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i know what types of music they like, for the most part
<Hipster_Brony> 8for the record, !!Derpy is a total hipster like me
<SirSprinkles> 6I speak to !!Spike a bit since he wanders the GET threads every now and then. And I talk to !!PinkiePie when I see him, though I haven't for a while.
<Ghosties> 4Oh god, and Amonisis is now making a thread about what happened today
<Ghosties> 4Jesus
<Hipster_Brony> 8i told him he shouldnt, but oh well
<SirSprinkles> 6*facehoof*
<MisterBristle> 7Thats Amonisis for you, undyingly optimistic and usally won't listen to reason :D
<Hipster_Brony> 8pretty much
<MisterBristle> 7He's still awesome though
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like him though
<Ghosties> 4Yep, Bristle, that's pretty much Amo
<SirSprinkles> 6I have no issue with Amonisis. Don't know him well enough to say either way.
<Ghosties> 4I used to dislike Amo with a passion
<MisterBristle> 7I say let him do what he wants, the thread looks like it's going pretty well anyway
<Espeon> 06cats killed the chat
<Hipster_Brony> 8Amonisis is basically the "good angel" on the shoulder of ponychan
<MisterBristle> 7Who's the bad one.....
<Hooh54> 4Too much floof
<Hipster_Brony> 8The observer?
<Espeon> 06never
<Hipster_Brony> 8maybe Whelp?
<MisterBristle> 7Lol maybe, the Observer makes me laugh, and he's easy to beat, you just got to love him
<Angel_Espeon> 13Never enough
<Hooh54> 4True
<Ghosties> 4N
<MisterBristle> 7I'm gonna be honest, I've never really talked to Whelp but he seems like a prick
<Ghosties> 4N!o is probably the bad angel...well
*Espeon yawn for real now though
<Ghosties> 4Actually no
<Hipster_Brony> 8Whelp can be an asshole sometimes, but sometimes hes pretty cool
<Ghosties> 4We don't really have a truthfully "bad" angel on the site because mods would banhammer them so swiftly that they'd still be typing their messages as they were being kicked out
<MisterBristle> 7Pretty much
<Nick> lol I just yawned there too thinking about it
<Angel_Espeon> 13that makes me yawn every time :<
<Hipster_Brony> 8maybe Haackula
<Espeon> 06Good, because cute c:
<Espeon> 06But yeah
<Espeon> 06good night
<Espeon> 06:3
<Hooh54> 4Night :3
<Kosoveon> good night
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nighty night~
<SirSprinkles> 6I dislike Haack.
<Skylands> 10Yawning in contagious
<SirSprinkles> 6He's a troll if there ever was one.
<MisterBristle> 7Haack is just silly
<SirSprinkles> 6And not the good kind of troll like me. The annoying kind.
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes a complete and total parasprite
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Nii
<Hipster_Brony> 8sometimes i can tolerate him, sometimes i just want him to leave the site
<SirSprinkles> 6It's when he starts going "Doesn't this belong in /boardnamehere/" that bugs me.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's like, no, it belongs in /oat/, deal with it.
<MisterBristle> 7Am I the only one who only really dislikes one person on Ponychan?
<SirSprinkles> 6I have no dislike towards most ponies.
<SirSprinkles> 6I tolerate most of them.
<MisterBristle> 7Only one man, Hal rocker, fuck that guy
<SirSprinkles> 6That. Guy.
<SirSprinkles> 6I DISLIKE that guy.
<Skylands> 10Pipe'd
<SirSprinkles> 6With ALLCAPS and everything.
<Ghosties> 4HAH, Hal
<MisterBristle> 7He's such an asssssssss
<Ghosties> 4I hate that he posts himself for every post
<MisterBristle> 7Yes, that is like, Attention horse over 9000
<NightSeas> 12Wb
<Ghosties> 4He's pretentious and full of himself. I mean, really, who the fuck posts pictures of themselves on an imageboard? Even if Ponychan is a board that is dedicated to love and tolerance and all that, you don't see anybody else doing it
<SirSprinkles> 6Most ponies are tolerable because they only have a few flank moments here and there.
<Quanyails> 7Thanks.
<SirSprinkles> 6He is like... UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<MisterBristle> 7Sometimes, I don't understand how he can even watch the show, he's that much of an ass
<SirSprinkles> 6...nice Hipster.
<SirSprinkles> 6Way to respond to the N thread.
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of people who don't watch the show
<Hipster_Brony> 8talking about the /meta/ thread, i assume?
<HyperMetalLugia> His router was unplugged :p
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<MisterBristle> 7Yes Ghosties?
<SirSprinkles> 6The one where I'm waiting for him to respond to me.
<Hipster_Brony> 8astray?
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Hipster_Brony> 8what about him?
<Ghosties> 4Oh wait, you already spoke to DCD about him. I guess he doesn't need to be brought up
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<MisterBristle> 7astray? whos that?
<MisterBristle> 7Explain
<Hipster_Brony> 8dont worry about it bristle
<SirSprinkles> 6If you don't know, you don't want to.
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes a dick
<Hooh54> 4Hi Quan, hi Nightseas :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes one of DCDs IRL friends who came by to help us get a stream set up last night
<SirSprinkles> 6It was like dealing with somepony from /b/
<Hipster_Brony> 8while he was doing that, he was also talking about sexually abusing minors and calling us gay for liking ponies
<MisterBristle> 7Then....why the fuck was he here?
<SirSprinkles> 6To train us to stream.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD asked him to help with technical stuff
<SirSprinkles> 6Thank Celestia we shouldn't have to deal with him now.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but he will be dropped down to half-ops
<MisterBristle> 7If he hate ponies, why help his PONY liking friend, set up a BRONY stream?
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol i dunno
<MisterBristle> 7what a dumbass
<Hipster_Brony> 8and DCD assured me that he wont be paraspriting us during the streams or anything
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said astray will only come in if he specifically asks him to come in for a reason
<MisterBristle> 7man /oat/ sure is boring today, (besides the whole donation thing)
<SirSprinkles> 6And then N was a parasprite.
<Angel_Espeon> 13My mum is watching that silly Paris Hilton BFF thing
<SilverSonic> ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Angel_Espeon> 13The whole concept for the show is just pathetic LOL
<SilverSonic> ewwwwwwwwww Paris Hilton
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not clicking that spoiler Hipster.
<SirSprinkles> 6I know what it is.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, you might enjoy that post
<MisterBristle> 7link?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i want him to click it
<SirSprinkles> 6I know it's a flute.
<Hipster_Brony> 8even if he doesnt get it
<MisterBristle> 7FLute?
<Hooh54> 4ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Hipster_Brony> 8i just fluterolled N on the /meta/ thread
<MisterBristle> 7lol inside jokes are inside
<SirSprinkles> 6...you weren't here for Fistfull of Dollars, are you?
<SirSprinkles> 6*were you
<Ghosties> 4Deeper, you mean
<MisterBristle> 7lol no idea what a fluteroll is
<Hipster_Brony> 8ive actually fluterolled people in a few threads and had a fair amount of people get it
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, you would have had to have been here for Fistfull of Dollars to get it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its a spoilered pic of a flute
<SirSprinkles> 6Quite a few people seem to get it, actually.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its like rickrolling, but with a flute
<Skylands> 10Paris Hilton lul
*Skylands is reminded of Dane Cook's jokes
<SirSprinkles> 6I love getting to post the OC somepony made about me.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Proof that I am a good troll.
<Hipster_Brony> 8saw that
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, the reason the filename is "can" on the flute is because i renamed the file to fluteroll !!PinkiePie in the can thread yesterday
<Ghosties> 4Basically, whenever a flute plays around Clint Eastwood, you better fucking run
<SilverSonic> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> Who?
<Ghosties> 4God help you if he's near barrels too
<SirSprinkles> 6I renamed mine to numbers.
<SirSprinkles> 6Back when I got you.
<Hipster_Brony> 8im gonna do that eventually
<NightSeas> 12Hi Hooh
<Hipster_Brony> 8makes it less obvious
<NightSeas> 12/late
<Skylands> 10Dane Cook is a comedian, HML
<SirSprinkles> 6The 300x300 dimensions makes it obvious too.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it doesnt help that flutes are the only things i ever spoiler
<HyperMetalLugia> Never heard, but okay
<Skylands> 10ESPY
<Hipster_Brony> 8because none of my pics are even borderline unacceptable
*Skylands pokes

<Skylands> 10http://i651.photobucket.com/albums/uu233/ISukiAlbelNox/Crossover/17834432.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6I tried to fluteroll somepony just now.
<Angel_Espeon> 13YES
<MisterBristle> 7Feelsgoodpony.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6The spoiler didn't work.
<SirSprinkles> 6So it shows the flute.
<SirSprinkles> 6RAAAAAAAAAGE.
<Ghosties> 4I forgot by who, but they were specifically targeting /b/ and opening up their Ddos to the rest of the net
<Skylands> 10My life is complete
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol that means nothing to me

<Angel_Espeon> 13Mecha Kyubey in the background LOL
<SirSprinkles> 6That is pure win.
<Ghosties> 4In any case, Ponychan goes back to hugging and reassuring one another while /co/ goes back to calling each other fags and mocking Ponychan. All is as it should be
<SirSprinkles> 6...Bristle left.
<HyperMetalLugia> Whaa
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, he left about twenty minutes ago
<HyperMetalLugia> Cool
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
*SirSprinkles 6wasn't paying attention
<Hooh54> 4I like the cat thing in the background
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, N needs to respond to my trolling him.
<HyperMetalLugia> That is Kyubey
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil little thinng

<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. the !!Rarity appreciation thread.
<Lambda> dun dun DUN
<Lambda> I need to take care of one of mine from this year yet
<SirSprinkles> 6Though !!Rarity saged it after a while because the mods decided they don't want attention.
<Lambda> I need to pay interest before it builds
<Lambda> right now I only have to pay 70 something
<InfamousZed> student loans or car loans

<Angel_Espeon> 13and that scene is awesome
<InfamousZed> out campus adopted this one bookstore just to raise their credibility but the price went skywards
<Hipster_Brony> 8which, ironically, i started as a way of bridging the divide between /chat/ and /oat/
<Hooh54> 4Full of fluff
<InfamousZed> should have sold some of them too
<Hipster_Brony> 8and then the mods moved it so that it was more or less irrelevant
<Lambda> our campus has a bookstore too
<Skylands> 10[19:21] <HyperMetalLugia> Too girly, would fit the black girl better
<Lambda> and the books there are way overpriced

<SirSprinkles> 6I was kidding, obviously.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
<SirSprinkles> 6Besides, bias is fun.
<Skylands> 10Also imagine if Shiny was here
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohgod
<Ghosties> 4I wanted to talk about exposure for us, actually
<Roleplay4life> 5and his hands as they dance over the fingerboard, oh my gosh, he's so talented. ;w;

<Roleplay4life> 5YES haha.
<Ghosties> 4DCD, Sprinks and I were talking about expanding the BMN to places like Twitter and the like and at first I thought it was a great idea
<Skylands> 10For our kids silly
<Roleplay4life> 5Geddy Lee.
<drf-Droid> thought so
<SirSprinkles> 6If so, it's probably a joke.
<Roleplay4life> 5<3
<HyperMetalLugia> Forgot :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly me ;3
<Roleplay4life> 5You're learning. xD
<Skylands> 10NS is our adopted daughter btw

<HyperMetalLugia> Can we abuse her?
<Skylands> 10You can
<HyperMetalLugia> Or at least give her the meds
<Armageddon> ):
<Silverscreen> 11I put regular reports of BMN on the Brony Facebook. Which reminds me, I have to do that now.
<Roleplay4life> 5At least he's talented. Unlike Justin Beaverface.
<Skylands> 10That's what father's do, right?
<Roleplay4life> 5He's /worth/ fangirling over.
<Skylands> 10Abuse their daughters
<drf-Droid> eh

<Roleplay4life> 5I don't fangirl unless they're /worth/ my attention. xD
<drf-Droid> I keep my crushes to myself :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Or am I?
<Roleplay4life> 5What's the fun of that? (;
<Ghosties> 4Well, in response to that, I started realizing that streaming movies we didn't procure by normal means may get us royally fucked in the future
<SirSprinkles> 6You never know.
<SirSprinkles> 6Except that you do.
<Skyla> no
<SirSprinkles> 6That's the joke.
<Skyla> they fuck their daughters

<Roleplay4life> 5Neil Peart! Percussionist for RUSH.
<HyperMetalLugia> Good
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<Ghosties> 4And expanding is a bad way to gain unwanted attention
<Skylands> 10I'm sure NS will be at it all night though
<drf-Droid> oh
<Roleplay4life> 5ANYWAYS. xD;
<drf-Droid> my heart belongs to LL :P

<Hipster_Brony> 8Silver, I don't think I can do the daily /oat/ anymore
<Roleplay4life> 5(inb4 aw! :3)
<drf-Droid> I might see another Weird Al concert
<Silverscreen> 11Because of your busy schedule?
<Roleplay4life> 5Dude that would be so epic. O:

<Ghosties> 4See ya in a bit
<Roleplay4life> 5Cheap Trick and .88 Special are coming to Omaha for a FREE 4th of July concert omigosh I'm so excited yaaaay~
<Silverscreen> 11DCD has claimed he has "ways" of getting movies. I would say it's pirated/free downloads, but I'd rather not ask.
<Ghosties> 4But how are we getting everything "legally?"
<prince-dari> For the enjoyment I anticipated experiencing after performing said activity?
<drf-Droid> XD
<Roleplay4life> 5And I live BLOCKS AWAY from the venue. 8DD
<Hipster_Brony> 8I will probably have to put in more hours at work once the contact period starts
<drf-Droid> I filmed the last Weird Al concert I went to
<HyperMetalLugia> What Dari?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ghosties, dont worry about it
<Hipster_Brony> 8we'll be fine
<drf-Droid> www.youtube.com/WeirdAlConcert
<Silverscreen> 11Understood. What sections did you cover?
<drf-Droid> creative account name, no?
<Roleplay4life> 5Ugh, you're not one of those people who holds your phone up the whole time are you? D:
<drf-Droid> I used a camera, but maybe :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Lols
<Roleplay4life> 5People do that at RUSH concerts and it's soooo annoying!! They block your view!!!!!! Dx
<drf-Droid> There was nobody behind me
<Roleplay4life> 5Not to mention terribly rude.
<drf-Droid> empty seat
<Growlithe> !silence
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
<Growlithe> !silence
<Roleplay4life> 5Haha, well that's good.
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
<drf-Droid> plus
<Growlithe> !silence
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
<Growlithe> !silence
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
<Growlithe> !silence
*Skylands says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
<drf-Droid> I talked to a guy who was at that same concert
<drf-Droid> who got his camera taken q
<CaitSith> Never.
<drf-Droid> away by securifty
<drf-Droid> *r
<drf-Droid> so I feel special for not getting caught
<Silverscreen> 11Um, what time will Sprinkles begin the pre-show?
<Skylands> 10Oh lawd
<Skylands> 101 	Armageddon 	[18] [45] [423] 486 	"LET'S WATCH HML AND SKYLANDS MAKE OUT."
<HyperMetalLugia> :3
<Ghosties> 4Whenever he gets to the cafe I presume
<HyperMetalLugia> Should we?~
<Ghosties> 4That said, I think he should stream an ep for you guys so you can see what you think about it
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah Michael Mosbach (part of Rush's security team) has like EAGLE EYE for that sort of thing. xD But they've released their last few tours on DVD anyways, so.. /shrug
<Skylands> 10and my sample quote doesn't even make sense
<Ghosties> 4I think the quality is a little fuzzy
<Skylands> 10oh wait, that's cuz it is the ASCII art
<Roleplay4life> 5(inb4 don't ask how I know who Michael is :X )
<Armageddon> bbl
<prince-dari> Though the enjoyment that I experience after performing said activity may not live up the pleasure gained from the anticipated experience.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<Skylands> 10We shall @ HML
<HyperMetalLugia> Stalker
<drf-Droid> well, Weird Al doesnt
<drf-Droid> he has several concert exclusive songs
<Skylands> 10Bye NS :<
<drf-Droid> so I taped the one I went to
<HyperMetalLugia> Bye NS ;o
<Roleplay4life> 5Nuuuuuuuu Neil Peart wrote all about Michael in one of his books. I SWEAR I'M NOT A STALKER.
*HyperMetalLugia makes out with Sky again :o
<Silverscreen> 11alright. and what time did we say we'd stream on Saturdays?
<drf-Droid> now I have an HD camcorder so ;D
<Skylands> 10Armageddon is missing out
<Roleplay4life> 5Haha. The main thing people tape about Rush's concerts are Neil Peart's solos, because each show is slightly different.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh well
<drf-Droid> heh
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> I tend to prefer album versions to live ones, but I like the concert-exclusive stuff
<Silverscreen> 11nevermind. Sprinkles put the post in the thread.
<Roleplay4life> 5Live albums are awesome.. sometimes.
<drf-Droid> too much cheering LOL
<Roleplay4life> 5Like "Exit... Stage Left" (yes that is a Snagglepuss reference xD) is a great live album.
<drf-Droid> and the rock bands I like SUCK live
<drf-Droid> like Green Day
<Roleplay4life> 5Which ones are tho--?
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh yes Green Day. Eeurgh.
<drf-Droid> their albums are awsome but they can't perform live for crap
<Roleplay4life> 5Fall Out Boy is terrible live too. D:
<drf-Droid> Linkin Park is like that too
<Roleplay4life> 5I think the true mark of a great band is how they perform live.
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> yes, but, I only care about catchiness LOL
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver, i was going to cover EQD, /collab/ and /chat/, if i remember correctly
<Roleplay4life> 5I care about musicianship. =P
<drf-Droid> I don't mind processing as long as it's not stupidly annoying (a la T-Pain)
<HyperMetalLugia> Terrible-Pain (to your ears) :O
<drf-Droid> but now that they can use autotune live, you never know who sucks anyway LOL
<Neon> I have to get my hands on this soundtrack.
<Roleplay4life> 5Sometimes Rush has pedal-triggered sounds when they do live but that's because they're SO OBSESSED with having it sound like the album.
<drf-Droid> the only good T-Pain thing is I'm On a Boat
<Roleplay4life> 5It's like 150% every show. xD;
<Roleplay4life> 5Ugh Autotune.
<Roleplay4life> 5REBECCA BLACK LOL.
<drf-Droid> or anyone
<drf-Droid> like EW MILEY CYRUS
<Roleplay4life> 5She doesn't use Autotune does she?
<drf-Droid> all you need now to be famous is publicity.
<drf-Droid> yes she does
<drf-Droid> like EVERYONE uses autotune now LOL
<Roleplay4life> 5Nooooooooooo~ D:
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean I never liked her in the first place
<Roleplay4life> 5but still! D:
<prince-dari> Lawl, everyone.
<drf-Droid> XD
<prince-dari> Only in pop.
<prince-dari> >__>
<Silverscreen> 11Thanks.
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> not always
<Roleplay4life> 5I thought she actually had integrity.

<Roleplay4life> 5GEDDY LEE HAS NEVER USED AUTOTUNE. <3
<drf-Droid> they've used "pitch correction" for years
<drf-Droid> even for rock.
<drf-Droid> autotune is just an extreme example of that
<Roleplay4life> 5Of course that means sometimes his voice doesn't sound perfect on stage but he's almost sixty freakin' years old!
<prince-dari> Metal > rock anyway.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> EW METAL
<HyperMetalLugia> :O
<Roleplay4life> 5Prog rock > Metal
<prince-dari> EW POP
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drf-Droid> the only music I can't stand
<prince-dari> EW PROG ROCK
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew Rap
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Roleplay4life> 5HOW
<drf-Droid> is country and metal/screamo/w/e
<prince-dari> EW RAP
<Roleplay4life> 5HOW CAN YOU HATE ON PROG. :C
<drf-Droid> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Hip-hopera is the best
<prince-dari> No, metal is best.
<HyperMetalLugia> What is Prog? O.o
<Roleplay4life> 5Prog is like the epitome of rock musicianship!!!!!
<prince-dari> Ok, fine, but metal still > prog rock.
<Ghosties> 4I'll be right back, gotta close my tabs
<drf-Droid> I don't dislike rock as a genre, there's just so much of it that it's hard to find the good stuff
<drf-Droid> metal is just screaming >_>
<Roleplay4life> 5Prog is Progressive Rock. It uses a lot of odd instruments, mini-moog (yeah!), complex time signatures, concept albums, oohhh it's so good.
<Roleplay4life> 5DRF, not the original metal.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<drf-Droid> synthesizers ftw
<prince-dari> DRF, GTFO if you think that. >__>
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> Metallica is good
<drf-Droid> but I consider them rock
<HyperMetalLugia> Synthies :D
<prince-dari> Metallica's old stuff was good, new stuff is poor.
<Roleplay4life> 5The original metal was actually good. Not like today's metal. Which is cruddy imo.
<drf-Droid> agreed
<drf-Droid> stuff like Enter Sandman and For Whom the Bells Toll
<Roleplay4life> 5Rush was freaking obsessed with the synths in the eighties omigawd it's like GET ME A GUITAR IN HERE AND GIVE ALEX LIFESON SOMETHING TO DO.
<drf-Droid> are awesome songs
<prince-dari> CoB are awesome.
<drf-Droid> 80s synth pop is amazing
<Ghosties> 4Alright, back
<drf-Droid> eh
<Roleplay4life> 5Cygnus X-1 is an epic prog song haha~
<drf-Droid> never been into CoB
<HyperMetalLugia> My favourite music is 70s and 80s synth XD
<prince-dari> How about A7X?
<drf-Droid> I generally just like anything upbea
<drf-Droid> t
<drf-Droid> A7X has too much screaming for me
<drf-Droid> Afterlife is alright, though.
<Roleplay4life> 5http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwNlbqol_8 <--- This is an example of too much synth D: (Sorry the quality's kinda bad. xD; )

<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Roleplay4life> 5That is an example of TOO MUCH SYNTH and not enough bass. D:

<HyperMetalLugia> DRF goes to class at 9pm O.o
<Mikey> hi
<drf-Droid> 8-10
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail

<Stormy`> Hey
<Silverscreen> 11What /meta/ thread?
<Roleplay4life> 5I love the part at 1:36 in that video where the line goes, "shouting guards and smoking guns" and the next beat is BANG FIREWORKS. 8D
*prince-dari dumps all the links he has found recently.
<drf-Droid> XD
<Ghosties> 4I don't remember exactly what it was about
<Roleplay4life> 5It's actually a very sad song, lyrically.
<drf-Droid> the onlgy Rush song I heard is YYZ
<drf-Droid> that was pretty good
<Roleplay4life> 5GYAH
<Roleplay4life> 5YOU NEED MOAAR
<HyperMetalLugia> No he doesn't
<HyperMetalLugia> :>
<prince-dari> Another Hasbro advert with bronies in it (just a text one this time): http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MeKyQplzJj0/TfMLw6DNNUI/AAAAAAAAFvE/ovX-QsHG_zs/s1600/brony-ad.png
<drf-Droid> didn't they do Spirit of Radio? as that song bugs me
<Roleplay4life> 5If you thought YYZ was good you need to hear La Villa Strangiato. (Another instrumental.)
<Roleplay4life> 5Spirit of Radio has an epic beginning though~
<drf-Droid> I hate the beginning
<Roleplay4life> 5And some of the lines are--
<Roleplay4life> 5WHAT?
<drf-Droid> and instrumentals ftw
<Roleplay4life> 5You were not blown away by the epic riff?
<Roleplay4life> 5What song starts with a RIFF?
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Roleplay4life> 5That's what makes it epic. xD
<drf-Droid> I was looping an instrumental of Don't Stop Believin earlier
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh lol
<drf-Droid> I have one, its very rare
<Stormy`> .
<drf-Droid> I fricking love piano
<Roleplay4life> 5That song is so overplayed now on the radio though. ;~;

<Hipster_Brony> 8the pony requirement from /oat/, specifically
<drf-Droid> heh
<Hipster_Brony> 8it creates so much confusion
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> pastebin?
<Roleplay4life> 5I would rather hear Lady Gaga for three hours than hear Tom Sawyer on the rock station again. They need to familiarize themselves with the rest of Rush's extensive discography. xD;
<Skylands> 10Fine x.x
<drf-Droid> Lady Gaga is good
<Roleplay4life> 5They have over 160 songs. PICK ONE. BUT NOT TOM SAWYER.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay Gagafans :3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> :>
<drf-Droid> her music, not her personality
<Roleplay4life> 5I do like Lady Gaga.. in small doses.
<drf-Droid> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Well..hrm

<Roleplay4life> 5Bad Romance is very catchy. Beyond belief.

<Sneas> 03xD
<Roleplay4life> 5I am not.
<Neon> We lost Zed and RDX... carboard cutouts might suffice.
<Roleplay4life> 5I like ponies that actually exist and eat hay and stuff.
<drf-Droid> ^
<Roleplay4life> 5They're adorable. :3
<drf-Droid> I mean MLP though
<Lambda> I can handle that
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah I know. xD
<drf-Droid> inb4 "I own a horse" meme
<HyperMetalLugia> Why did everyone go from
<HyperMetalLugia> Hating MLP
<Skylands> 10(This will take a while, just saying)
<HyperMetalLugia> TO loving it due to a stupid cartoon
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<drf-Droid> I've always hated it
<prince-dari> Not everyone did?
<prince-dari> Most people still don't like it.
<Roleplay4life> 5Actually I don't hate MLP itself. I'm kind of indifferent. But the people who revolve around it like they revolved around HTTYD is irritating!
<drf-Droid> ^
<HyperMetalLugia> Well the girls did at fkirst :P
<drf-Droid> I hate HTTYD fanbase
<HyperMetalLugia> *first
<Roleplay4life> 5**are irritating

<Lambda> nope
<Roleplay4life> 5And he was hailed as a hero!
<Roleplay4life> 5GAWD!
<HyperMetalLugia> And lost a leg!
<Neon> u ghey
<drf-Droid> that's why TS3 was so amazing
<HyperMetalLugia> HE LOST A PERDICTABLE LEG XD
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah but he got a replacement and it was PERFECT. :|
<drf-Droid> since it wasn't predictable
<HyperMetalLugia> But oh well, he should of died
<drf-Droid> I was all ZOMFG DON'T DIE
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh wait, perdictable
<drf-Droid> @ TS
<drf-Droid> e
<Roleplay4life> 5I think he should've died or had a more useless prosthetic.
<drf-Droid> 3
<drf-Droid> I cried in theaters, twice
<prince-dari> Everyone should always die, it makes good movies.
<HyperMetalLugia> What is TS again?
<Ghosties> 4Hey Sprinkles, would you mind streaming an ep of FiM so the guys can get a look at what we'll be dealing with?
<Roleplay4life> 5And the entire village/community/etc. was all very stereotypically "Viking" while he had a dorky midwestern-ish accent.
<HyperMetalLugia> Transporter? O.o

<drf-Droid> it was like being forced to give up my childhood
<Lambda> Yay for not being in Spyrochat

<HyperMetalLugia> I laughed at Marley and me
<Roleplay4life> 5 8C
<HyperMetalLugia> But eh, oh well
<Silverscreen> 11It's not confusion, it's that people don't regard that rule or just barely make it part of a thread. THAT'S what makes /oat/ confusing.
<Mikey> :P
<Neon> I... I broke RDX and Infamous.
<Roleplay4life> 5It was heartbreaking!
<Neon> Cool!
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya LLOTS :P
<Roleplay4life> 5Mainly because my dog's getting older and we know she's on her last proverbial ....
<HyperMetalLugia> So what if <spoiler>
<Roleplay4life> 5**proverbial leg
<drf-Droid> as much as I like dogs, movies about dogs are getting old.
<HyperMetalLugia> My sisters love them >.>

<HyperMetalLugia> Same
<drf-Droid> as dogs from space ftw :P
<Roleplay4life> 5I cried at the end of Where the Red Fern Grows. (The book, obviously.)

<HyperMetalLugia> Greater Dane XD
<Skylands> 10[21:23] <@Sneas> goddamn alot of shit <- But hey, it's activity :3
<drf-Droid> I HATED that book
<prince-dari> I don't like dogs, so dog films have always been old for me. :P
<Roleplay4life> 5I was in like 4th grade man, give me a break. D:
<HyperMetalLugia> And I was scared for the time the dogs nearly got shaved LOL
<Roleplay4life> 5:C
<drf-Droid> same with TKAMB and Tuck Everlasting
<drf-Droid> I could not stand either
<prince-dari> Yeah, but people complain about ponies when there's pretty much no activity otherwise anyway.
<Roleplay4life> 5Tuck Everlasting was overrated.
<prince-dari> So content does matter.
<Roleplay4life> 5But seriously? TKAMB was a masterpiece.
<Hipster_Brony> 8exactly
<Skylands> 10On second thought I should've probably made that expire
<Roleplay4life> 5Not as much as 1984 though.
<drf-Droid> its so boring
<Skylands> 10Oh well
<Roleplay4life> 5OR FAHRENHEIT 451
<drf-Droid> 1984 was awesome

<Roleplay4life> 5And not to get off of classics but every Stephen King book ever
<Roleplay4life> 5YESSS
<Hipster_Brony> 8and it seems like most people dont really want there to be a pony requirement anyway

<HyperMetalLugia> Her parents co-authoured it too!
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<Roleplay4life> 5and she is three million times the writer S. Meyer is or will ever be!!
<Roleplay4life> 5HML, nope. I've done my research on her.
<drf-Droid> anyone is
<Roleplay4life> 5She's just legitimately talented~
<Roleplay4life> 5DRF, lol, ain't that the truth haha.
<drf-Droid> anyway
<drf-Droid> class ended early
<drf-Droid> bbl
<Roleplay4life> 5The point is Amelia never sold out her books and made a big marketing franchise about it. She's got that artistic (author) integrity I wish more authors had.
<Roleplay4life> 5So yeah. xD; Endrant.
<prince-dari> DAMN YOU OVERCAST ENGLISH WEATHER
<prince-dari> Make me unbable to see lunar eclipse. :(
<Roleplay4life> 5Aww. D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8my god
<Hipster_Brony> 8my "get to know /oat/" thread is already autsosaging
<Hipster_Brony> 8its been up for what, an hour and a half?
<Hipster_Brony> 8oops
<Hipster_Brony> 8 2 and a half hours
<Hipster_Brony> 8but still
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/enterprise_apps/230600173 < Yay
<prince-dari> TL;DR
<Lambda> I kicked the cardboard
<Roleplay4life> 5Huh.
<Roleplay4life> 5Ow. I just did a fist pump in the air and my arm screamed in pain. (Figuratively. D: )
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry it took so long guys, FME didn't save the settings.
<Roleplay4life> 5FREAKING VACCINATIONS. ><
<SirSprinkles> 6Starting now.
<Ghosties> 4What do you guys think?
<Silverscreen> 11Hmm...Ghosties was right. The picture is a little fuzzy. But otherwise it's good.
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't run it at high res, which is why it's fuzzy.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm working out the kinks a little more.
<Silverscreen> 11Sound is good, no lag.
<Roleplay4life> 5... I effectively killed the chat. xD;
<Roleplay4life> 5HUZZAH.
<SirSprinkles> 6Had to turn up the sound there. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Forgot to turn it up on VLC
<Neon> That's just destructive.
<Hipster_Brony> 8quality is slightly lower than DCD's but it'll work
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, interesting choice of episode
<SirSprinkles> 6I just picked whatever my mouse was on.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm actually at my friend's so I can see the quality here.
<Ghosties> 4See the fuzz we're talking about, Sprinks?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not horrible, but it's there.
<SirSprinkles> 6Friend's never seen the stream and he says it's good enough that it wouldn't bother him. But that may be slightly biased.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i wish i had IRL friends that would be fine with watching ponies... sigh
<Silverscreen> 11ARGH has given me the secret to the listserv.
<Roleplay4life> 5..I predict the chat will be silent until DRF returns~
<SirSprinkles> 6I have a few IRL friends that watch ponies.
<Hipster_Brony> 8cool
<Hipster_Brony> 8we can make an announcement about that during BMN
*Chimera chews
<Chimera> 04:3
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh hey, my prediction was wrong.
<Roleplay4life> 5YAY.
<Roleplay4life> 5xD
<Roleplay4life> 5So what's up?
<Chimera> 04Working on Flash
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh cool. (:
<Roleplay4life> 5What's the project?

<Silverscreen> 11Plus, fucking DCD has me addicted to my Phoenix Wright ROM that I now have.
<Hipster_Brony> 8doesnt seem safe
<Silverscreen> 11On the other hand, I prefer this to sitting around my fucking dorm all day playing Incredible Hulk, so it's all good.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8POPUP
<SirSprinkles> 6I wish watching a thread didn't mean popup in the middle of my screen.
<SirSprinkles> 6Will have to remember to have any and all threads watched before stream.
<Silverscreen> 11I don't get popup.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm gonna head out of Brony State so I can get my shit organized. I'll be back afterward.

<eXAKR> now think about that old ponytale
<eXAKR> (and yes that is Singapore)
<eXAKR> "The Sun's gone dim, and the sky's turned black"
<eXAKR> "'cause I loved her, and she didn't love back"
<prince-dari> No way. O_o
<eXAKR> Think: her = Nightmare Moon
<prince-dari> That fits so well, lol.
<eXAKR> Yea
<prince-dari> Though you've only got about 10 seconds of Luna to work with, are you going to use NMM instead?

<SilverSonic> and some people dont want to hear about ponies 24/7
<prince-dari> :P
<Espeon> 06I still don't see why there's not a pony channel either way though. And SS now you're being unreasonable :P

<prince-dari> Oh, what makes it more stupid than any other word?
<prince-dari> Morning.
<Angel_Espeon> 13no, it's a label that gets stuck on anyone who happens to like the show
<SilverSonic> :P
<Espeon> 06It really depends on who you ask
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> hey there xD
<SilverSonic> well, Im certianly NOT a brony, and im glad im not :P
<Espeon> 06which means it's bad and good at the same time I guess

<Angel_Espeon> 13It's been boring today, but thankfully i finished college early |D
<prince-dari> Oh, that's nice.
<Fireant> Hey SweetieBell!
<Espeon> 06Been quite nice this far, a bit boring but that is all.
<Fireant> GOT YOUR CUTIE MARK YET, BLANK FLANK? *snicker*
<gingerale-> Woahhh, double client all the way!
<gingerale> \o/
<lightumbreon> nice too, still coughing alot, and bored
<lightumbreon> no school for me though, too sick
*SweetieBelle gets a texta, YEP!
<Angel_Espeon> 13D: I know i've said this before, but get well soon~
<lightumbreon> thanks :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm personally the kind of person who very rarely takes days off if I'm ill, unless I'm literally unable to move without feeling the urge to throw up or something xD
*SweetieBelle was ImpassionedSilhouette but that doesnt suit her, so picked this nick ^_^
<Angel_Espeon> 13and it's been years since I was that badly ill
<Shamrock> Uhhhhhmahgahd.....
<lightumbreon> me too
<Shamrock> SWEETIE BELLE IS MY FAVORITE!
<Shamrock> :D
<lightumbreon> 2 years for me X.x
<Shamrock> :$
<SweetieBelle> ^_^ Metoo
<Shamrock> High hoof!
<SweetieBelle> She's just so *squee* adorable!
<Shamrock> True dat.
<Shamrock> And dat voice....
<Angel_Espeon> 13no matter how bad my cold is, I force myself to go to college, then I get to sit there feeling sorry for myself all day whilst passing it around to as many people as possible
<Shamrock> DAT VOICE :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I feel better quicker somehow if I pass it on to others LOL
<lightumbreon> xD
<SweetieBelle> ^_^
<lightumbreon> viral lung infections can´t be passed over O.o
<lightumbreon> so, dah
<prince-dari> Maybe zombies just feel bad so they want hugz?
<Shamrock> Fluttershy is my favorite out of the mane six, though.
<lightumbreon> and eat yer ffin brains out
<lightumbreon> YEA RIGHT
<lightumbreon> i lol when someone actually got the reference
<prince-dari> No one understands zombies. :'( I bet they cut themselves.
<SweetieBelle> My favs are of course SweetieBelle, then Rarity and Fluttershy
<RoyKirbs> Same.
<RoyKirbs> Very very very very same.
<Shamrock> Eh, Rarity is too prissy.
<Shamrock> But I ship Sparity any day of the week.
<SweetieBelle> Every girl likes to get dressed up ^_^ I am a combination of the personalities
<MPR> Sparity?
<RoyKirbs> In fact Fluttershy makes up a giant chunk of my pony folder.
<MPR> yeah, I never understood why girls like "dressing up"
<MPR> ...CLOTHES GO WHERE?
<SweetieBelle> Just do ^_^
<MPR> honestly we shouldn't have to wear clothes. :|
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nah, they just enjoy having rave parties on minecraft
<Shamrock> I'd have absolutely no complaints.
<SweetieBelle> Its winter where I am, even if the world was "clothing optional", I would still wear them
<lightumbreon> xD
<RoyKirbs> Clothes are overrated.
<sonic500> O_o
<MPR> winter where you are?
<SweetieBelle> I bet people working in a retirement home will complain.
<SweetieBelle> Melbourne, Australia
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've decided I should play that game sometime :B
<MPR> pfft
<MPR> like that's an actual place
<Shamrock> Ooo, do you have an accent? :D
<Shamrock> SPEAK WORDS.
<SweetieBelle> Heheee
<SweetieBelle> I dun, you all do.
<Shamrock> SHRIMP ON THE BAHBIE.
<MPR> australia is fake.
<sonic500> ?
<Shamrock> It's a myth.
<Shamrock> It's like Atlantis, or Portland.
<SweetieBelle> Hehe
<sonic500> Are you insaine?
<RoyKirbs> Or Topeka!
<Shamrock> *whispers in SweetieBelle's ear *speak your language...
*SweetieBelle speaks "Aussie" for all to hear :P
<Shamrock> *shudders in delight* :D
<MPR> it's an aussie sweetie belle
<Shamrock> :$
<MPR> ....do want.
<MPR> -.
<Shamrock> Wait...NONE OF THE PONIES HAVE VAGUELY AUSTRALIAN ACCENTS.
*SweetieBelle pauses.. *squee*
<SweetieBelle> *gasp* MLP is not multicultural! :P
<Shamrock> I SHALL KIDNAP THE AUSSIE ONE AND KEEP IN HER MY CASTLE FAR FAR AWAY WHERE NO ONE CAN HEAR US-- I mean....uhhhh...
<SweetieBelle> I think I am going to have to get some fakie's and make aussie ponies!
<Shamrock> NOTHING I SAY IS GOOD!
<Coz> Stop the all caps
<SweetieBelle> Australia IS far far away :P
<Shamrock> As is America, in relative terms.
<SweetieBelle> Truetrue.
<Shamrock> Wait....so is it SNOWING where you are? Or is Melbourne too warm?
<Shamrock> But we have no castles...
<SweetieBelle> Its snowing on the alps
<Shamrock> Meet in the middle? France?
<SweetieBelle> The snow season started (strongly) about a week ago
<Shamrock> Well, middle-ish.
<RoyKirbs> Australia is a wacky world.
<Shamrock> Ah, I'm SICK of snow after this winter.
<SweetieBelle> French ponies... Ooooo
<sonic500> I live in scotland..we have crap wheter
<Shamrock> You might actually have to fight for my afffections there, miss. ;D
<RoyKirbs> with it's hats hand joeys and mountains and desert places./
<SweetieBelle> Melbourne very very rarely gets snow around suburbia and nothing like it does in the US
<Shamrock> So....do you see kangaroos often, or are they exclusively in the OutbacK?
<SweetieBelle> The French-Australian accent is to die for.
<sonic500> Oh gods did you relly ask that
<Shamrock> Yep.
<SweetieBelle> I see wallabies occasionally
<MPR> sweetie, now I want to hear you talk. :|
<Shamrock> SCHWEEET.
<MPR> and now I sound like a crazy stalker person
<MPR> which I'm not
<MPR> it's just that your shirt and pants don't match
<sonic500> Heh
<SweetieBelle> Ive been asked if Australia has paved roads.. Yeah.. Im here on the INTERNET and we dont have paved roads.. Pssh.
<Shamrock> Wait, she's WEARING a shirt?.....whose house am I in?!
<sonic500> ?
<SweetieBelle> Im wrapped in a coat, its cold here!
<sonic500> In austrailer?
<MPR> Sweetie, you have roads at ALL?
<Shamrock> *hugs her* Shamrock uses SUMMER WARM TIME!
<sonic500> I thought it was always hot
<MPR> weird
<Shamrock> Hemispheres, man. They mess EVERYTHING up.
<SweetieBelle> Hehe
<MPR> I've always been in favor of the US saying "fuck roads we need wifi all over errywhere instead"
<MPR> then that'll get people to spend more time inventing flying cars
<sonic500> LOLs
<MPR> and less human interaction
<SweetieBelle> Australia has every climate except Arctic/Antarctic
<Shamrock> Japan has pretty awesome internet.
<sonic500> But crap whether
<Shamrock> 1000 MB/S I heard, somewhere.
<SweetieBelle> Yeah, Japan has fibre optic to HOME
<MPR> let's move to Japan
<sonic500> Gods no
<SweetieBelle> Hai.
<Shamrock> Oooo, she used "re"....smexy. <3
<Shamrock> TYPE COLOUR!
<sonic500> Is that even a word
<Shamrock> We spell it "fiber"
<sonic500> Fiber?
<SweetieBelle> Hehe
<SweetieBelle> Favourite ;)
<Shamrock> OOoooo....
<Shamrock> MOAR! :D
<Shamrock> DO WANT.
*SweetieBelle giggles n hides
<Shamrock> *finds her* 'ello.
<SweetieBelle> Speakems all differents :P
<Willzahk> Aloha!
<Shamrock> So is Doctor Who as popular down under as it is in the US/Britain?
<SweetieBelle> Yep
<MPR> Down under?
<MPR> I love that name.
<MPR> It makes me snicker.
<SweetieBelle> I prefer Dr Whooves though
<Shamrock> (Point of interest: I'm actually HALF British. Me mum is from across the pond....but I don't have an accent)
<lightumbreon> ohai Nick
<Shamrock> (My nan does, but my mom lost her's)
<SweetieBelle> Me too! However, I have a partially pom accent, very few can pick it.
<SweetieBelle> Family is from Sheffield
<Shamrock> Shweet.
<Shamrock> I want to go to Australia, but I'm afraid of dingoes.
<SweetieBelle> I have a pet one
<Shamrock> FALSE. You cannot domesticate a dingo.
<SweetieBelle> Well, she is part dingo part shep
<Shamrock> That's what I thought.
<Shamrock> ;D
<Nick> hi lightumbreon
<Shamrock> *pats her head* no need to exaggerate, love.
<SweetieBelle> Oh, you can, but they bite.
<Shamrock> I heard they were uber dangerous, mate.
*SweetieBelle blushes
<SweetieBelle> They are.
*SweetieBelle grins, Isnt everything in Australia, or so I hear :P
<Shamrock> True...
<Shamrock> I REALLY want to avoid the Reef.
<SweetieBelle> http://i49.tinypic.com/2ic74hf.jpg
<Shamrock> D'awwwwww.
<SweetieBelle> Well, the reef is getting bleached so you might want to see it while you can
<SweetieBelle> Her name is Jess
<Shamrock> Bleached?
<SweetieBelle> The rising water temperature is killing it.
<Shamrock> Ah.
<Shamrock> That sucks.
<SweetieBelle> They say bleaching as it kills it, turning it white and COLOURLESS :p
<Shamrock> Awwww :(
<MPR> Aussies use excess Us?
<MPR> cool.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nichola~

<lightumbreon> :3
<UxieLover1994> 13Hey there!
<SweetieBelle> I am sooo getting a cutie mark RL
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Tattoo?
<gingerale> I have a request for a rule on the topic
<gingerale> "Friendship is paramount"
<SweetieBelle> Yus
<SweetieBelle> Just a lil one
<Chimera> 04should get goinig
<UxieLover1994> 13Rats! Missed you again...
<gingerale> I wouldn't know what tattoo to get..
<gingerale> It'd have to have a meaning to me but there's nothing like that yet
<SweetieBelle> Thats what I am wondering, make something or get something already made
<SweetieBelle> I am getting a certain star constellation above it.. MMmm
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm good.
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Something already made would be recognizable
<Chobi> That's good
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> but there's the risk of getting tired of it xD
<Revolver> Right on time.
<Revolver> 'Sup, guise?
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> nothing much rly xD
<AVeryStrange> <-- Listening to Bronyville.
<SweetieBelle> If the mark means something to me, Ill never get tired of it.
<Revolver> Huzzah for nothing much!
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> true...
<Revolver> Wow, is it too early in the morning or something?
<AVeryStrange> I guess?
<SweetieBelle> Its something I wanted for a while, a small tattoo.. and since becoming a brony~ette.. Ill make it a cutie mark
<AVeryStrange> I mean I just woke up
<Revolver> Loltastic.
<Revolver> So did I.
<gingerale> So how are these channels divided exactly? This is the random chat? Studies the elitist chat? And then AfterDark and RP are what exactly?
<Revolver> I woke up with no alarm clock exactly at 10:00.
<Revolver> Lol.
<AVeryStrange> General chat, so anything pony related.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I would hope so.
<AVeryStrange> Afterdark - apparently still general, but you can bring up adult topics/words
<Revolver> AfterDark is clop, basically.
<AVeryStrange> RP = roleplaying, so get your ponysona on
<Free> Revolver: not really.
<Revolver> Well, I don't ever go in there.
<Revolver> So I wouldn't know.
<gingerale> Ew, I thought AD was just a chat for us older folks
<Revolver> Did I just beat Lucas to the plate?
<Chobi> Heheh mhm >w<
<Free> Well, not unless Fireant's on...
<Revolver> Nope.
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Afterdark isn't usually R-18
<AVeryStrange> gingerale: That's kinda what it's billed as
<AVeryStrange> I haven't checked it out though
<gingerale> Oh okay
<Avian> Hihi ^v^
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> but the conversations tend to swerve that way
<AVeryStrange> Ah
<gingerale> Talking about doing taxes and the days at jobs? :B
<Revolver> AD is where it's allowed.
<Avian> Eeep
<gingerale> *at work
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> here, swerve to R-18
<Revolver> Here it isn't, so people like Fiddler tend to stay here less.
<UxieLover1994> 13Hello?
<gingerale> And shaving. Us old guys like to shave. And baking cakes. *nodnod*
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> and you will be warmed
<UxieLover1994> 13DSD?
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> warned**
<Avian> I've got this idea for a flash game but I'm not sure what to do with it
<AVeryStrange> Aren't there chan boards you could pitch it at?
<Revolver> Ooh, that reminds meh.
<Avian> Oh?
<prince-dari> Avian: Go on.
<Revolver> I can sprite for an entire game of MLP, but I'm a terrible programmar.
<AVeryStrange> Idk, I here things in ED news posts but I couldn't point you to one.
<AVeryStrange> *hear
<prince-dari> I know AS3 for Flash.
<AVeryStrange> Jesus christ I must be tired ><
<Avian> After playing around a little in flash cs4 and learning more about AS2 and 3, I came up with an interesting idea for a flash game
<Avian> Anyone here ever play Harvest Moon 64?
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> and that is?
<Revolver> Thing is, a RPG is called for, here, as is my spriting style.
<Revolver> Ooh, I did!
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> I'm aware of the series yes
<gingerale> Hmm..
<Revolver> That was so fun.
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> played rune factor
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> factory**
<lightumbreon> brb, changing computer
<Avian> What I have in mind would be a crossover between Friendship is Magic and Harvest Moon 64
<gingerale> I work as a junior java software developer.. And I just realized. My work place doesn't have a water cooler.
<AVeryStrange> Complete with simplified dating sim element?
<Revolver> Awesome.
<SweetieBelle> I so did not mean to click that little [X].. then the browser crashed..
<Revolver> Lol.
<Avian> You play the role of a male work pony trying to turn a defiled farm around
<gingerale> I always just fill a bottle with water instead
<SweetieBelle> Derpys fault!
<Avian> You can also date one of the mane six
<AVeryStrange> xD
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> the dating sim element interests me
<Avian> and eventually marry them
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> xD
<Revolver> :L
<AVeryStrange> Sounds cute.
<gingerale> Oh yeah
<Revolver> I am meh about this idea.
<gingerale> I should get on my pony game project too
<Dreloth> Newrp, sup my bronies.
<gingerale> I'm using OpenGL for rendering the graphics though so I can make all kinds of shiny particle effects for it 8D
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> greetings xD
<Avian> I LOVE Harvest Moon 64, it's honestly the perfect fam sim game, or at least would be if it wasn't for all the glitches
<Lucas> Hey rev...
<AVeryStrange> Oh fun. OpenGL in C++ or java?
<gingerale> Java
<Avian> Combining it with Ponyville would be a great combination
<Revolver> On one hand, dating Applejack would be pretty cool, but then again, watching other people talk about how they married Pinkie Pie would not be 'superfuntastic'.
<AVeryStrange> Haaave fuuuun.
<gingerale> I haven't done C/C++ for years
<gingerale> I always have fun <3
<AVeryStrange> Mmm
<SweetieBelle> Remember that guy who MARRIED the character in his DS?
<SweetieBelle> What was that dating sim....
<Dreloth> lol, yes
<Revolver> Actually, shipiing between anyone normal and PP would be scary in the first place.
<SweetieBelle> Took the body pillow to the wedding.
<Revolver> UNLESS you can customise char.
<Lucas> Now I'm savvy with it's nice...
<Avian> Oh god...
<gingerale> And OpenGL on Java isn't too bad. lwjgl and slick2D are plenty good for using it.
<AVeryStrange> I just can't get behind shipping PP with anyone because it requires a personality overhaul just to make it feasible.
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly
<Avian> Chances are the game would be point and click
<Avian> and drag
<Revolver> Same here.
<SirSprinkles> 6How have you been?
<gingerale> Shipping Pinkiepie? I ship her with Megatron.
<AVeryStrange> gingerale: If you're sticking to 2D it wouldn't be bad, no. It's just both java and JOGL are....bulky. Full 3D is deadly to framerates
<gingerale> Yeah, I'll pass full 3D
<Revolver> So, unless you support Main Char customization, it'd be kind of annoying.
<gingerale> No interest with going there.. I kind of hate 3D rendering.. Bad experiences back when I thought it'd be cool. <.<
<gingerale> *from
<Revolver> And how does one even go about telling PP you love her?
<Revolver> Throwing a party?
<Revolver> That wouldn't be HM at all.
<AVeryStrange> You do take soem artistic license with any character, but it gets pretty wild when PP is involved.
<Revolver> And, how would you give the BLUE FEATHER to Rainbow?
<AVeryStrange> *some
<AVeryStrange> Revolver: Ahahaha that's a good point
<Revolver> I mean, honestly.
<Lucas> And serious you borrow a lot of reference from Tribly's Notes and 6 Days a Sacrifice...
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Hmm, if it's harvest moon, you'd need a farm
<AVeryStrange> Maybe make it one of Celestia's feathers instead
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> maybe you can start with the apple family xD
<Revolver> Awkward Harvest Moon Plothole go.
<Avian> Hehehe, that's actually a reasonable question Revolver

<Lucas> Bridgekeeper, you clever rev.
<Revolver> Wait, Lucas, did you watch 5 Days?
<AVeryStrange> gingerale: I absolutely love you now
<gingerale> <3
<AVeryStrange> I've been shipping Derpy <> Carrot Top .
<SweetieBelle> Poo. SweetieBelle is cuter
<gingerale> Ooh, that's a fun one too
<Chobi> Pretty good, woke up an.....15 minutes ago ouo lol
<Revolver> I'm liking this HM idea because it isn't gay.
<Chobi> You?
<Revolver> For once.
<Avian> Hehehehe
<AVeryStrange> Got a problem with that?:P
<Revolver> Not that i'm a homophobe, but gay gets annoying.
<Lucas> I WILL, OK?
<Fassad_McDuck> are you a SPY?
<AVeryStrange> Argh the emoticons
<Avian> There's nothing wrong with Lesbians. I lesbian lesbians
<Lucas> Just being corkscrewy with it...
<gingerale> Avian: Everyone is lesbians
<Apostle_of_Hatsune> Tone down the lesbian stuff guys xD
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Sorry about that
<Revolver> Nothing is wrong with that, but SOME people here aren't gay.
<Avian> I'm not a fan of shiping either. I hate ship to ship combat so much
<Revolver> SOME people....
<gingerale> Big Mac x Caramel? Lesbians!
<AVeryStrange> Hey, it's a show about 5 lesbians and 1 bi girl, what do you expect?
<AVeryStrange> gingerale: You're doing lesbians wrong
<Balloons> No it's not.
<gingerale> 8D
<Fassad_McDuck> (i like the term filly foolers better)
<UxieLover1994> 13That's okay
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Dealing with KH wiki stuff had to go to FB
<SweetieBelle> Well, Im bi, so half lesbian ^_^
<Avian> I"m pretty sure RD is the only real lesbian of the group
<Zenith> unlurking to say that gingerale made me lose my drink, thanks a lot
<SirSprinkles> 6What is sleep?
<SirSprinkles> 6Honestly got maybe like, an hour of sleep... >>;
<UxieLover1994> 13FB?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Facebook
<UxieLover1994> 13Oh. Okay :)
<UxieLover1994> 13So, whatcha been doing?
<Avian> Honestly, all cartoon shows have at least ONE character that is gay
<gingerale> You're welcome!
<SweetieBelle> filly foolers.. XD I love it.
<AVeryStrange> fillyfoolers = implication of pedophilia
<Revolver> (Filly Foolers and Colt Cuddlers, lol.)
<Avian> Lexington from Gargoyles was gay
<Avian> Dumbore is gay
<SweetieBelle> XD
<AVeryStrange> Fillydelphia = disturbing
<Avian> Rooter from the Sonic Archie series is gay
<Zenith> it's always sunny there
<Revolver> :T
<Lucas> Literally...
<Revolver> >:T
<Lucas> I'm being corkscrewy with the series...
<Fassad_McDuck> literally your only purpose
<Fassad_McDuck> YOU GOT ONE HOUR
<Fassad_McDuck> SOLVE IT
<AVeryStrange> I like to think of Twilight as bicurious but other than that I don't actually lesbian ponies indiscriminately
<Avian> A good chunk of cartoonist out there intend for at least one character to be homosexual, but censors continue to keep these characters quiet
<gingerale> Oh yeah
<gingerale> Has anyone read the new DuckTales, Darkwing Duck or Rescue Rangers comics?
<Revolver> :O
<AVeryStrange> Nope sorry
<gingerale> Because I have all the issues so far but haven't had tiem to read them..

<Revolver> I don't even use : P that much.
<AVeryStrange> : P
<Fassad_McDuck> O u O is now my favorite
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Yes it turns out in the gamecube and i'm sure all the rest in order to switch you need to push the pad in a few different spots
<Revolver> OnO
<Chobi> Lol aww man o_o
<gingerale> Hmm..
<gingerale> I wonder if I could write an online reader for those comics..
<AVeryStrange> How many here are MSPA fans at that?
<Avian> My favorate face is the happy bird face ^v^
<gingerale> Wouldn't be too difficult using servlets.
<Fassad_McDuck> :>
<Zenith> I read MSPA
<Revolver> That's actually my facial expression when reacting to most of the stuffs that go on here.
<Avian> That too
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Also it looks like Skylander is going to come out about 300$
<gingerale> MSPA <3
<Zenith> haven't caught up with Homestuck yet though
<Lucas> I wonder if Doctor Scratch is Cadabath's across-the-street- neighbor...
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay. I've never played a GameCube, so I assume it's harder on that.
<AVeryStrange> ^_^
<Zenith> only like 3/5 done
<gingerale> I started reading it when it was still showing Problem Sleuth. I caught up when the final boss battle started.
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4What type of money do you use there?
<Fassad_McDuck> OH GOD HOMESTUCK *hides under cash register*
<AVeryStrange> Zenith: so that puts you somewhere in act 5, right?
<AVeryStrange> gingerale: Same!
<Zenith> I think I actually just started Act 4 so my estimation was a bit off
<Lucas> And Rev...
<AVeryStrange> Yeah Act 5 is a beast
*Espeon rolls
<Espeon> 06And o.o
<UxieLover1994> 13We use Australian money, which is a lot like American money. Prior to the 60s, it was British money
<Fassad_McDuck> *swings around hammer* lucas, is it ok to clobber dat dere revolver?
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not that big of a deal.
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4oh
<SirSprinkles> 6I pull all nighters quite frequently.
<UxieLover1994> 13And $300? I just hope it's an awsome game! :)
<Lucas> Um? no
<Zenith> is today "talk like Dedede in the dub of the Kirby anime" day
<Fassad_McDuck> (he's just hiding)
<Fassad_McDuck> i actually like 4kids dedede...
<AVeryStrange> Hssss 4kids
<Chobi> Hah you're lucky...I couldn't pull an all nighter if I tried
*Chimera hugs
<gingerale> I'm loving how Hussie is fueling my Vriska x John ship <3
<Fassad_McDuck> that was probably their best dub... that's not saying much though...
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm currently on KHII, and it's not much longer 'till the battle with Sark and the MCP!
<gingerale> But then again
<AVeryStrange> Vriska needs to hurry up and die.
<gingerale> Knowing him he'll probably just kill her off straight there and then
<prince-dari> $300? O______________________________________________________o
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4well thats my guess
<gingerale> Vriska is the second best troll though <3
<Lucas> ANYWAY
<AVeryStrange> Because he's always straightforward >.>
<Fassad_McDuck> *hits revolver on the head* found you!
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4 70$ for Spyro the gmae with three to four figs
<Revolver> ...

<eXAKR> Wow
<Roleplay4life> 5You're not out for summer?
<eXAKR> I just discovered the convert ink feature in OneNote
<SkyRyd3r> I'm in Canada
<SkyRyd3r> Canadians end in June
<eXAKR> It's surprising accurate
<SkyRyd3r> :P
<eXAKR> and hi guys
<Roleplay4life> 5Aaahh, okay, I see.
<SkyRyd3r> Hey eX
<SkyRyd3r> So while we end one month later, we do start in September :P
<Roleplay4life> 5eXAKR, I think that feature is annoying. xD It usually doesn't work that well for me.
<eXAKR> RP4L: I liked your Nyan Cat spoof avatar you used to have on teh forums XD
<eXAKR> And oh?
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh, haha! xD Thank you~
<eXAKR> I scribbled cursive, and it worked perfectly

<eXAKR> What's your OneNote version? I'm using 2010
<Roleplay4life> 5Hm.. well, it wasn't /OneNote/ I used but a similar program.
<SkyRyd3r> Cats crossbreeding with poptarts

<eXAKR> And Nyan Cat <3

<Roleplay4life> 5xDD
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4God theres a lack of Cynder and Angel
<UxieLover1994> 13It's not criticism. It's infomation and my thoughts. And that's good there is nothing negitive about it
<Roleplay4life> 5The Epic Sax Guy is my god.
<UxieLover1994> 13You saw the Legado, DSD?
<UxieLover1994> 13What'd you think?

<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4ok
<Angel_Espeon> 13"I could hit that all day long... with an iron pick"
<UxieLover1994> 13Anyway, what are you most impressed with, DSD?
<Angel_Espeon> 13these minecraft tutorial videos amuse me with the guy's unintentional innuendos |D

<SkyRyd3r> He just makes me want to find a rainbow and punch it in the face.
<Roleplay4life> 5How dare you scar the perfect image of an Alto with the freakin' MLP character!? D:

<SkyRyd3r> dari, how long have you been with TST?
<SkyRyd3r> Or at least Chat?
<Roleplay4life> 5Which story, Sky? D:
<SkyRyd3r> RP4L: You know which one.
<Roleplay4life> 5Er, which story of mine. xD
<eXAKR> Roleplay4life
<prince-dari> I don't actually use the forum, but the first time I've been on here was probably in 2009.
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Um
<SkyRyd3r> Your most recent one
<SkyRyd3r> LOL
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4The BBS part
<eXAKR> Who were you saying was not worthy? Oo
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh, Cut to the Chase.
<SkyRyd3r> dari: Probably why I haven't seen you, I became inactive around 2009
<Roleplay4life> 5eXAKR, lololol I was saying that um -- Fluttershy -- or whatever -- wasn't worthy to take care of the legendary birds. xDD
<SkyRyd3r> Was active from 2006-2009
<Roleplay4life> 5In that picture.
<prince-dari> Ah right.
<prince-dari> Roleplay4life: Reverse is true from my PoV. :>
<Keiya> http://i.imgur.com/txBzs.jpg <- I think that Peach is into drag racing :P
<eXAKR> What. oo
<Zenith> I don't really know what to make of that picture
<Roleplay4life> 5Sky, so you /are/ reading it? ;w; That makes me happy~ Because I see Aurora is now updating hers a LOT and she's got soooo many views and I don't think I'm getting any new readers. xD;
<SkyRyd3r> RP4L
<RoyKirbs> There's no shells of any colour variation here.
<SkyRyd3r> I was one of the people that got her back to writing it
<SkyRyd3r> LOL
<SkyRyd3r> A few days ago.
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean
<SkyRyd3r> And I updated a chapter of mine too
<RoyKirbs> also, that stupid freaking horse is in the race.
<Roleplay4life> 5I think it's really cool she's getting back into it
<SkyRyd3r> Though that chapter is a tragedy
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean one writer to another
<SkyRyd3r> Your story was a surprise
<SkyRyd3r> I usually don't check other people'
<SkyRyd3r> people's fanfics*
<Keiya> ? Horse?
<Keiya> You mean Yoshi? Yoshi's a dinosaur...
<Roleplay4life> 5Hm? Oh, well, then I'm glad you picked it up. ^^;
<RoyKirbs> Are you sure?
<SkyRyd3r> I instantly liked yours
<SkyRyd3r> Randomly clicking on it on dA
<SkyRyd3r> :P
<SkyRyd3r> Though your comment was like "OMG A COMMENT FROM YOU!?"
<RoyKirbs> Because he looks like a horse to me.
<prince-dari> LOL
<SkyRyd3r> What's so special about a comment from me? :P
<RoyKirbs> Also: WHY IS THERE A GUY DRESSED AS PEACH.
<prince-dari> Yoshi a horse, haha, nope.
<Roleplay4life> 5When it comes to fanfics I'm really motivated at first but if I feel like no one reads then.. yeah..
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh, haha, well, you never comment on my stuff.
<Roleplay4life> 5Not that often anyways.
<Zenith> Well, Yoshi /does/ have a saddle
<SkyRyd3r> True. :P
<SkyRyd3r> But yeah it comes with the job
<RoyKirbs> Yeah!
<SkyRyd3r> Not many people read fanfics anymore on the boards
<Roleplay4life> 5I have a pretty good way of keeping track (in my memory) of who comments often. I don't get nearly as much feedback as I'd like.
<SkyRyd3r> Not even the RP board.
<RoyKirbs> What dinosaur would wear a saddle?
<Roleplay4life> 5(I read 'em. o-o)
<prince-dari> Have you never played Mario games before?
<Roleplay4life> 5Um, if they interest me. ^^;
<ZekeS> RoyKirbs: yoshi ofc
<RoyKirbs> yes
<Roleplay4life> 5The "other" fanfic board not so much because I don't know any of the fandoms. >__>;;
<SkyRyd3r> Lmao RP4L, it's been like that in terms of comments for a long time for me.
<SkyRyd3r> Hence the lack of motivation to do more :P
<UxieLover1994> 13What's your favourite world in KHII?
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah but the weird thing is that I'm getting a LOT more faves than I used to
<SkyRyd3r> I don't touch the "Other" board, though I do know of them.
<Roleplay4life> 5but a lot LESS views and comments.
<SkyRyd3r> Well the more you put up, the more people notice.
<SkyRyd3r> :P
<UxieLover1994> 13And I'm glad you like the BbS part, even though it's not quite finished
<Roleplay4life> 5df'dsaglkjlas;dgka; it's really frustrating.
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Olympus Coliseum
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah I suppose, but I really only work on one fanfic at a time. xD
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Uxie did you see my Userpage on the spyro wiki yet?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4I just updated it
<Roleplay4life> 5And my art projects take AGES and I'm not satisfied with some of the quick work others are satisfied to put up.
<UxieLover1994> 13Cool!
<Roleplay4life> 5Even if something doesn't turn out how I like I still SLAVE over it for a week or more.
<UxieLover1994> 13My favourtie world is Space Paranoids!
<UxieLover1994> 13I also like Halloween Town and Timeless River!
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4So i take it you guys don't want to be co-founders of the spyro DA group?
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4DX
<Roleplay4life> 5I like how, on DeviantART, you can get to a point of popularity where if you scribbled "hi!" and a stick figure on a napkin people would FAVEBOMB it and it'd get at least 100 faves. xD
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm still part of it. I'm even going to draw all 14 Talismans for it! (Check my SW userpage)
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4I know but no one wants to be co-founders
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm a co-founder!
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4!
<Roleplay4life> 5....I effectively killed the chat.
<Roleplay4life> 5Yay me. :|
<Espeon> 06~
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Nice
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm currently working on the Glimmer Talisman: Magic Pick. Should be done by Saturday

<Roleplay4life> 5Oh hey it's not dead~
<Espeon> 06not quite
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4Also is it just me or is Aura using the images i get?
<eXAKR> I could share a YouTube video right now
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4I mean it's ok i guess but it ties us in more
<eXAKR> But I'm sure it will drive everyone here nuts
<eXAKR> It drove me nuts as well
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4sorta like the kh wiki and the khwikia
<eXAKR> It involves Pokémon Black and White.
<eXAKR> And Pinkie Pie.
*eXAKR RUNS
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm doing it by order of world visit. I'm also going to draw some orbs
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay!
<UxieLover1994> 13Hm?
<SilverSonic> >_>
<SilverSonic> Someone tell eXAKR to keep the pony chat in the pony channel
<SilverSonic> cause he put me on ignore >_>
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah. But I'm pritty sure things will be different once we merge with Spyropedia (shoud Spyrorocks ever contact one of us)
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> 4DAri is Spyro ever here?
<eXAKR> OK it's finally dead
<SilverSonic> :P
<SilverSonic> !space

<Angel_Espeon> 13SS, learn to tolerate things
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<prince-dari> Yeah, he's on quite often.
<prince-dari> You've just got to highlight him when he's on.
<Chobi> Suddenly quietness.
<Fireant> Because of Nun.
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah, I learned to tolerate Lucario fanboy---
<Roleplay4life> 5 /SHOT
<UxieLover1994> 13Problem: I work most of the time.
<invizalol> nun?

<Angel_Espeon> 13ignore is for silly people
<Zenith> nedroid
<Chobi> Ah oki
<lightumbreon|DNF> stupid caps
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Roleplay4life> 5Ignore is for people who can't handle other people. (;
<Dashie> Inviza, did you add more questions last night?
*lightumbreon|DNF goes chewing bubble gum again, again
<prince-dari> But that's exactly the situation here, he can't handle ponies. :P
<invizalol> nah i went to bed, then i had to do work today :(
<invizalol> fail i know :P
*Dashie whips Inviza* ADD MORE QUESTIONS.
<Shaico> lol you tried that before Fireant
*invizalol obeys.
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's eXAKR who put SS on ignore apparently, not him
<Shaico> my feet smell weird...
<Angel_Espeon> 13But you know, it would be nice to spend a day in chat without a pony conversation for a change~
<Angel_Espeon> 13I literally can't do a day without hearing about them these days xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13*go
<prince-dari> I mainly post MLP stuff when no one else is talking though, and when I stop, no one's saying anything anyway, they only talk to say "Ew ponies", then go away.

<Fireant> I am okay with the hind legs.
<Vburr> to ossala at least
<Hooh54> 4A bit like that animation
<ColorSpectrum> on mine?
<Fireant> Fatter than normal, but for me its ok.
<Fireant> Ponies tend to have stronger built hind legs anyway.

<CogWeaver> *waits patiently*
<CogWeaver> hmm...I don't know
<UxieLover1994> 13lol "I Luv Jazz"
<Hooh54> 4Lol
<CogWeaver> they might have common ancestry....
<CogWeaver> y'know, in evolutionary theory and whatnot
<Lurkingear> cuz they taste simmilar...ly
<Lurkingear> like lemons and oranges :/
<CogWeaver> yeh, I guess
<Tosxychor> they all meet in a common ancestor sometime in the past
<Lurkingear> this requires research!
<Tosxychor> but they're quite the different species
<CogWeaver> [Citation Needed!]
<Chobi> oxo?
<Espeon> 06My little brother is kind of a mini-me
<Espeon> 06and that's rather creepy at times
<Lurkingear> The pear is classified in subtribe Pyrinae within tribe Pyreae and is a perennial. The apple (Malus domestica), which it resembles in floral structure, is also a member of this subcategory.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Lurkingear> this wat i found :/
<SirSprinkles> 6But partial nudity in a couple scenes.
<lightumbreon> does he do the finger as good as mini-me?

<ZekeS> testing
<Wlah> ah
<Lurkingear> they didnt show much, so i still cant think of any games for it :/
<derpybrony> i think the FPS thing they showed was interesting. how the screen on the controler was literally the view from your scope.
<Lurkingear> bhut the new Super Smash bros thing...
<derpybrony> O.O yes
<derpybrony> im just wondering if it is compatible with the 3ds

<derpybrony> although marth was there in melee speaking japanese
<Lurkingear> but hey, the wii u will take some months to come out
<Tosxychor> well, that's because it was a fighting game :p
<derpybrony> XD march 2012
<Lurkingear> and then smash will take some more time
<Espeon> 06Need some all-natural glue for sure
<derpybrony> so it may completely change by the time it is out
<Lurkingear> eeeyup
<derpybrony> i think i was won over with the 3ds presentation though

<prince-dari> CogWeaver couldn't handle the truth.
<Ali1017> not refering to THAT Twilight
<SirSprinkles> 6I dislike when my watched threads tell me there's a new post... and it turns out to be mine.
<ZekeS> don't forget to /msg NickServ IDENTIFY

<Icydragon> I would but I'm an idiot so...
<Ali1017> this is pony chat, thus i'm refering to pony Twilght

<gingerale> Whut?
<Hipster_Brony> 8one of my IRL friends just posted an article on facebook from the washington post arguing that we should bring back public floggings instead of prison
<Larscis> You asked a question and I attempted to provide an answer for it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8wtf?
<Fiddler> your attempt was not good enough
<Larscis> My attempt was excellent. I can only attrite your misunderstanding to human error.
<gingerale> I am confuse
<Larscis> And my lack of letters in "attribute" to Bluetooth connection errors.
<Fiddler> larscis is a ROBOT
<SirSprinkles> 6...wtf indeed.
<Hapori> ...

<HyperMetalLugia> Need peppercorn

<Revolver> My internet died, and my Dad came over here to check it out, and it started working again.
<CogWeaver> I'm taking a break from the RP for a little while here, Rev. I'll get back to it soon, though don't worry
<Revolver> Still.
<Revolver> I don't want to explain MORE plot to you.
<CogWeaver> then just do the RP without me
<Revolver> Taking a break is fine, but the explanations just keep piling up...
<CogWeaver> it was pretty over my head for the most part anyways
<ZekeS> Revolver: how long ago?
<midnightshadow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEbFXzZiuG8&NR=1
<Revolver> And plus it would be nice to have you for what's coming up.
<ZekeS> Forget explanations I can just send him chatlogs if it was in eqdrp Revolver
<Ali1017> its not
<ZekeS> o
<ZekeS> boo
<Icydragon> sure they do
<Revolver> Nope.

<SilverSonic> ^
<RainbowCrash> http://physicallypossible.deviantart.com/art/AppleJack-Is-Feeling-Derpy-213441136
<prince-dari> Minecraft is kind of boring.
<Sakuya> Its addicting
<Angel_Espeon> 13I didn't either until I started watching this tutorial series xD
<prince-dari> There's nothing to do.
<SilverSonic> for once i agree with dari
<Sakuya> But its best to play on a server
<SilverSonic> :P
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Derpy!
<IvoryVinyl> That's fuuny
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> wait thats applejack

<Sakuya> Like me?
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> NOOOO!
<User_7551> in working on a really bad pun
<RainbowCrash> wat?
<User_7551> l neighh noire

<User_7551> i have pictures too
<Roleplay4life> 5So it truly is all subjective.
<RainbowCrash> lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's like Animal Crossing
<Roleplay4life> 5There is no one THING that EVERYONE should/should not like.
<User_7551> kinda a work in progress
<Angel_Espeon> 13not that much to do
<Angel_Espeon> 13but so addicting

<IvoryVinyl> Nothing, I'm writing a song
<Sakuya> That
<Sakuya> But anyways
<BronyVids> so NPR wants to do an interview with me about Bronies and why I like the show should I do it
<Roleplay4life> 5Isn't everything anyone says automatically attached with "imo", then?
<Sakuya> Yeh
<SilverSonic> I have a tendency to do that so excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me
<SilverSonic> :P
<Roleplay4life> 5Except for like math equations?
<prince-dari> Sure.
<BronyVids> it's for the show Wait Wait Dont'e Tell Me

<User_7366> Guy, guys.
<User_7366> I got a question.
<User_7366> Who has an answer?
<BronyVids> Yeah hopefully I'll be able to give a good impression about the fandom that the wired article wasn't so great about
<ZekeS> User_7366: I have a BANHAMMOR does that count?
<User_7366> nope.avi
<SirSprinkles> 6I could derail it again.
<ZekeS> :<
<User_7366> :D
<Roleplay4life> 5...And if people lived by that code we wouldn't have war. /sigh
<SilverSonic> :p
<BronyVids> This woman named Eva is going to do a phone chat and I'll give my opinion about why I like the show
<IvoryVinyl> Depends on the question.
<SirSprinkles> 6But then it would be about classy ponies.
<SilverSonic> i like war
*SilverSonic flees
<ZekeS> We're fucked
<SilverSonic> jk
<CogWeaver> ?
<User_7366> I tried asking this Study, zekes probably saw it
<ZekeS> BronyVids: remember to talk in a sane fashion

<IvoryVinyl> Now I know how scootaloo feels when she bashed her head against the piano.
<RoyKirbs> Science.
<BronyVids> no one is bashing it I'm just saying it can make people have the wrong idea about Bronies thinking we are only how the Wired interview portrayed it.
<RoyKirbs> Scootaloo's head is a piano.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

<RainbowCrash> i bet u they`ll manipulate it -_-
<Ali1017> ok, just making sure *goes back to lurking*
<Angel_Espeon> 13because, as always, there's nothing better to eat and sandwiches are the only thing I can make |D

<SilverSonic> I still use VHS
<SilverSonic> :P
<RoyKirbs> amazing in a pie crust.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I actually know a person who may be willing to try it.

<SilverSonic> kinda pointless to spend money for something you already have :p
<HyperMetalLugia> I love VHA ;P
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Don't mind Lightning, though. He's a custom class based on speed.
<HyperMetalLugia> *VHS
<Roleplay4life> 5It just flat out doesn't function.
<Fassad_McDuck> that was just me getting myself over to somewhere
<Sakuya> Vhs tapes are horrible quality though lol

<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<SilverSonic> but you still have something :p
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<Sakuya> And they fizz out after enough plays
<SirSprinkles> 6Iunno.
<Roleplay4life> 5Well compared to BLU-RAY
<drfsupercenter> 03because VHS deteriorates
<IvoryVinyl> Well, I'm going to head to Study.
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<SilverSonic> yah you do :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I half succeeded.
<HyperMetalLugia> Still easier to record ;p
<drfsupercenter> 03not at all
<SirSprinkles> 6It's now classy music.
<SilverSonic> well, make em last them
<SilverSonic> then*

<Lightning_Quickhoof> Alright, go ahead and look at my guidelines and examples, and feel free to give me criticism.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Yep im british!
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> And i am quite partial to a spot of tea and crumpets!
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> ...
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> *hits self*
<SirSprinkles> 6I derailed it. With classy ponies. Like I said I would.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> nooo derpy..
<PK_Away> My head hurts
<MPR> I don't even know what a crumpet is
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Alright, link's open.
<MPR> I assume it's a trumpet made of bread and cookies
<MPR> I never bothered to look it up
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> ....
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Here's link again: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJoBTIs2NRZM_4kSRVAN2VqZQzwIGTPqKTfyK_CqZFs/edit?hl=en_US
<CogWeaver> I don't know either, but I do know a "biscuit" is the equivalent of a cookie
<Jacob_tech> hate to tell you LQ but its not
<Hipster_Brony> 8it kind of derailed to The Room on its own
<RainbowCrash> yup it isnt
<MPR> i do know that too cog
<Coz> what area you from derpy? East Anglia myself
<Mongoose> Hey look, Predators is on.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> A crumpet /ˈkrʌmpɨt/ ( listen) is a savoury griddle cake made from flour and yeast. It is eaten mainly in the United Kingdom and other nations of the Commonwealth. A crumpet in this area is similar in appearance (but not taste) to a North American pancake.
<RainbowCrash> mmm
<Mongoose> yum
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Try now, Jacob. I opened up the link for everyone to view.
<SirSprinkles> 6It did quite quickly.
<Jacob_tech> i would say a crumpet is like a burnt cookie with extra sugar
<SirSprinkles> 6But The Room is not hard to derail to.
<RainbowCrash> still not open
<SirSprinkles> 6Classy ponies is kind of just what I always derail to.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Oh Coz im in the East Anglia Area!
<Coz> Jacob_tech thats no crumpet I've ever eaten
<SirSprinkles> 6I repeat. You are not fluterolling me.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not even in the selection thread.
<Jacob_tech> alright i got it LQ i had to sign out
<Hipster_Brony> 8that was intended for other people
<Jacob_tech> Coz its ALOT like the ones i had in london last year

<RainbowCrash> pretty cool LQ
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Thanks.
<SirSprinkles> 6...what's the deal on bronyshow.com?
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't see it, it's blocked.
<Jacob_tech> what about the various Pegasi?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I don't really have any Pegasus-like or Alicorn-like characters.
<Sakuya> ...
<Lightning_Quickhoof> A friend has a dragon, though.
<Sakuya> This hp veer phone
<Hipster_Brony> 8dunno, isnt blocked for me
<Sakuya> Is it really that small o.o;
<SirSprinkles> 6I have sonicwall blocking it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Cafe wifi, remember?
<SirSprinkles> 6I meant what's the site like?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I was thinking of making LQ a pegasus, but that would be too powerful, and he's really my only athletic character.
<Jacob_tech> no im saying how would the ingame rules classify and make it so pegasi arent OP?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Hmm... Good question.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I haven't really thought about that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8what site, bronyshow?
<CogWeaver> so who agrees that pic of the young Cheerilee with Rick Astley (the one at the top of the EqD page) is the most adorable pic ever?
<Jacob_tech> like yould pegasi have a constant "Levatate" on them that just acts as a minor action activate?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I'd think so, yeah. That's a great idea.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Jacob_tech> i helped my freind make his version of GURPS... i kinda have a background in making roleplay systems lol
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Now the question remains: Should I take away Glimmermane's Ring of Levitation?
<Jacob_tech> he calls it DERP Deeply Engaging Roll Playing
<Hipster_Brony> 8just a normal blog
<Hipster_Brony> 8pretty much
<RainbowCrash> win
<CogWeaver> lol
<Lightning_Quickhoof> That's a boss name for an RP style.
<RainbowCrash> role* btw rite or is it roll? thats is ^
<Lightning_Quickhoof> It's role.
<Jacob_tech> no its ROLL as in the roll of the dice determines action
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I can imagine a "Roll Playing Game"...
<Cynder7> 6:3
<CogWeaver> no, it's role as in "you play the ROLE of a character"
<RainbowCrash> ok cuz i was thinking cuz of the dice also
<RainbowCrash> lol
<PK_Away> roll playing game is a pun
<Lightning_Quickhoof> "I'm a d6!"
<Icydragon> FEED MEH
<RainbowCrash> ya^
<PK_Away> it makes fun of players who only mixmax their characters
<RainbowCrash> lol
<PK_Away> and don't focus on story, interactions etc
<Jacob_tech> sorry cog but the roll of dice dictates your carachters action not you
<CogWeaver> poor D12...so misaligned...so unused...
<Lightning_Quickhoof> But you're playing a role.
<PK_Away> no the roll of dice determines success or failure
<Griggs> all natural glue
<CogWeaver> Even the D1 gets more play, and it doesn't even exist!
<Jacob_tech> you kidding fighters use d12 alll the time
<Sethisto> HEY
<Sethisto> so
<CogWeaver> Seth is here!
<Fooby> Hey ther--
<CogWeaver> *salutes Seth*
<Fooby> So?
<PK_Away> try 2d6
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Seth!
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Ones with Greataxes do.
<PsychicKid> >greataxe
<Sethisto> NPR Emails you and says "Give me a 20 second response about why you like My Little Pony!"
<PsychicKid> wwww
<Sethisto> What do yuo say?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Barbarians use d12s.
<PsychicKid> Because Twilight and Fluttershy are hhhhhnnnnnnnggggggggggg
<Jacob_tech> PsychicKid nice
<Jam> afterdark's nice
<Fooby> Art style is great, the characters are varied and well-developed,
<God_Empress_Celestia> Hi Sethisto
<Sethisto> yo!
<God_Empress_Celestia> and what fooby said
<Jacob_tech> also hey LQ i didnt see a ring in your sheet
<Coz> becuase my master wizard told me to watch and i did as he asked
<Fooby> Episode plots touch on subjects that aren't necessarily restricted to girly stuff.
<Fooby> i.e. more adult themes, makes it more relateable/enjoyable
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Ah. That's because it's under his "Notable Tricks"
<Fooby> -e
<MPR> okay guys, the crumpet debate is settled
<Fooby> I think I had an extra e in there
<MPR> http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crumpet&oldid=434639951

<Lightning_Quickhoof> Added details for them
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<Jacob_tech> i see it now i watched you edit it :P
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Lawl
<Jacob_tech> there was a debate on crumpets?
<Sethisto> So, pixar style hidden adult humor?
<ZekeS> that's a good ay
<Fooby> Well not all of it is hidden. And not all of it is adult.
<ZekeS> pixar-style humor
*Cynder7 6throws a cookie to Icy.
<ZekeS> Don't. Say. Adult.
<Fooby> Though the new banner reminded me of the Soapbox gag.
<Fooby> That was funny.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I'm just leaving out the abilities most MLP unicorns get.
<Sethisto> yah
<Icydragon> O thx :3
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Such as telekinesis
<Fooby> What could be used in place of Adult?
<Jacob_tech> ok so gonna break off from chat and read some flutterdash shipping... there really needs to be a seachbar for it :P
<ZekeS> pixar-style humor works fine

<drfsupercenter> 03well bbl, tutoring
<Jacob_tech> and LQ it looks good, im just a bit worried how combat would play out because a horse in D&D can only do 1d6 damage or a warhorse 1D8

<MPR> whooops
<MPR> i got a proxy, just didn't actually use it

<Lightning_Quickhoof> Eh, MLP ponies tend to carry things in their mouths and saddlebags.
<Jacob_tech> awesome dude! maybe it will be featured in a commercial
<Fassad_McDuck> 9001 days a saiyan
<Lightning_Quickhoof> They can use weapons.
<Fooby> <Sethisto> NPR Emails you
<Fooby> YOU TRICKED ME D:
<Sethisto> pft
<Jacob_tech> @_@ just thought of a Roranoa Zoro MLP character, but ALL 3 BLADES IN THE MOUTH!!!
<Jacob_tech> flutterdash time now
<MPR> I'd say that I love the animation, the depths of character personality, and the dialogue.
<Sethisto> So, pixar reference
<Sethisto> huge plus
<Sethisto> I'm including that for sure
<The_Linker> Hmmm?
<MPR> wait, Seth, did that actually happen to you?
<Fooby> Oh.
<Fooby> Music.
<Hipster_Brony> 8what time do you think you're gonna start pre-show tomorrow?
<Fooby> Particular songs based off of broadway hits.
<User_5166> guys. did anyone else see the drama on ponychan?
<Sethisto> happening at least
<The_Linker> Also, I'm assuming I'm the only one that sees my text in green?
<Larscis> At least on this end.
<Fooby> Except reword it so it sounds better.
<The_Linker> What Ponychan drama? O_O
<Jacob_tech> theres always ponychan drama
<User_5166> the one about the scammer
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I don't know; can you see this?
<PsychicKid> Ponychan drama
<PsychicKid> You mean the radio station bs?
<User_5166> nope
<PsychicKid> What happened now w
<PsychicKid> *lol
<User_5166> some guy from /co/ asked for donations
<PsychicKid> Goddamnit I gotta stop hanging around 2ch. I keep using w instead of lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll probably get here 2-2:30
<PsychicKid> oboyherewego.jpg
<User_5166> some ponychanners gave money
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Linker, can you see this text in green?
<PsychicKid> Lemme guess, it was a scam
<User_5166> it was found out that it was a scam
<The_Linker> No.
<User_5166> yup
<User_5166> and basically a bunch of threads popped up
<The_Linker> Well, at least I can pick out my own messages this way.
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh my. I just got a hundred bucks grad money from my aunt and uncle.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Huh.
<Roleplay4life> 5.....SCORE! 8D
<PsychicKid> Well people shouldn't fall so easily for that
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I don't know why it's set like this, then.
<PsychicKid> What were the donations for
<User_5166> and amonisis (one of the "popular" users) decided to "test" ponychan
<User_5166> and made a donation thread as an anon
<The_Linker> No more typing 'rainbow dash' with seven different colors. :'(
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Ikr
<User_5166> basically super drama now
<PsychicKid> I never donate money because I don't have a job
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay, thats about when im getting back from work, so thats perfect
<User_5166> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/arch/res/2497750.html
<MPR> Does this work?
<PsychicKid> I'll read it later
<Hipster_Brony> 8do you have any stuff you're planning on showing?
<Sakuya> Lol
<PsychicKid> My brain is numb from a nap; I won't be able to process the drama
<User_5166> i skimmed the first half then ctrl+fed amonisis
<SirSprinkles> 6For the preshow. Just a couple things. The usual vids that are almost always shown.
<SirSprinkles> 6HAVE to play Aladdin Commits Suicide.
<User_5166> it's tiring hearing the same few arguments over and over again
<PsychicKid> i read that as like
<PsychicKid> ctrl+FED
<PsychicKid> As in "the feds"
<User_5166> lmao
<Hooh54> 4Ohai
<PsychicKid> like an FBI command to search out crminals
<PsychicKid> Fucking beastly w
<Roleplay4life> 5Ohey
<Hooh54> 4I have come
<User_5166> yuppers
<PsychicKid> there's that w again
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm actually on youtube now looking about for things.
<AssertiveFluttershy> there we go
<The_Linker> 'M gettin' a job soon, but I think a chunk's set aside for a shiny 3DS.
<PsychicKid> I'm getting a job after I graduate
<AssertiveFluttershy> i've always wanted to try the 3ds
<PsychicKid> I can't handle both school and a job at the same time
<The_Linker> Wasn't interested at all until I saw gameplay of OoT-3D.
<The_Linker> Oh my god it looks good.
<Sakuya> Lies
<Hipster_Brony> 8you should totally show an episode of Kenan and Kel
<AssertiveFluttershy> i wanna experience it myself first before i decide
<PsychicKid> School is so draining
<AssertiveFluttershy> ikr
<PsychicKid> At least ponies are helping push me through it :D
<AssertiveFluttershy> stupid exams now
<PsychicKid> I'm taking summer courses now
<PsychicKid> Feels bad man
<PsychicKid> But, one is weather, and weather is interesting
<AssertiveFluttershy> thank god i don't have to take summerschool
<PsychicKid> The other is like music 103 or something silly
<PsychicKid> And my waifu is a singer so it's ok
<AssertiveFluttershy> lol
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<PsychicKid> I don't HAVE to take it
<PsychicKid> But if I don't, at least one of my semesters will be super packed
<AssertiveFluttershy> GAH i should really be studying for functions right now
<SirSprinkles> 6...if I can find one.
<SirSprinkles> 6I should look for that.
<The_Linker> I should be mowing the lawn right now.
<The_Linker> >_>
<PsychicKid> Knocking two courses out will let me re-distribute my last 3 semesters so the last one is only like, 3 courses
<The_Linker> <_<
<Roleplay4life> 5NOTHING IS REAL
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<PsychicKid> cuz I already gotta go an extra semester because of my minor
<AssertiveFluttershy> i'm pretty sure we're all supposed to be doing something right now
<SirSprinkles> 6YOUTUBE Y U BUFFER?
<PsychicKid> Actually
<PsychicKid> I literally have nothing to do for the next 16 hours
<AssertiveFluttershy> wow
<PsychicKid> Except register some small thing for my music class
<AssertiveFluttershy> that's quite fortunate
<Hooh54> 4Nuuuu'
<PsychicKid> I'm just that amazing
<The_Linker> Which you'll put off for 15 hours.
<The_Linker> :P
<PsychicKid> ^
<PsychicKid> Yes
<Hipster_Brony> 8ill look it up
<PsychicKid> I do that :D
<Hooh54> 4Youtube hates me right now
<PsychicKid> Although I should probably read the first chapter for the music class
<Sakuya> It hates everyone
<PsychicKid> Music theory goes over my head
<B-Man> Why do I have the sudden idea...
<Hooh54> 4none of the videos work D :
<Hooh54> 4I just get a black square
<B-Man> That someone should parody a Red Bull commercial with ponies?
<AssertiveFluttershy> it's already been done
<Hipster_Brony> 8heres a good one: http://megavideo.com/?v=P6OINJH5
<Roleplay4life> 5I hate how so many of my favourite YT videos have been deleted
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Red Colt gives you wings?
<Sakuya> Is flash player outdated?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I didn't know that.
<Roleplay4life> 5by the stupid copyrighting people. :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :(
<AssertiveFluttershy> wait
<The_Linker> Rarity: Red Bull gives you WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGS
<AssertiveFluttershy> actually no it hasn't
<The_Linker> Twilight: ...No, I did that.
<Sakuya> Yeah copyrights are crap
<Damos> I copy right this
<Hooh54> 4True
<AssertiveFluttershy> whoops
<Damos> I copyright that
<Sakuya> Well
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean the uploader BOUGHT it and it's not like they're making PROFIT off of putting it on Youtube, sheesh.
<Hooh54> 4I miss some old videos too
<AssertiveFluttershy> that wasn't ponies i was thinking of
<SirSprinkles> 6>:(
<Roleplay4life> 5It's all like.. community service. xD
<HyperMetalLugia> Sharing
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah!
<HyperMetalLugia> Is daring, not care
<HyperMetalLugia> *Caring
<Roleplay4life> 5And I love it when people share. <3
<SirSprinkles> 6>=(
<Icydragon> Oh god no
<HyperMetalLugia> But yeah, copytube is evil
<SirSprinkles> 6WHY CAN I NOT SEE MEGAVIDEO?
*Ray yaaaaaaawns
<AssertiveFluttershy> wow i'm retarded
<Sakuya> What I dont like is the removal of amvs
<Roleplay4life> 5Then the big bad fortune 500 company gets all butthurt and storms in to delete all the good videos. :C
<Roleplay4life> 5YES
<Roleplay4life> 5FFFFFFFFF
<Hooh54> 4YES
<Ray||Homework> 02(Inb4: Angel_Espeon)
<Sakuya> Its one thing to take down the videos of the actual movie
<Roleplay4life> 5That's just stupid!
<Sakuya> But amvs....that's ridiculous
<Roleplay4life> 5Omigosh or if they MUTE the video.
<Hooh54> 4I hate when they take down movies
<Roleplay4life> 5Because the song is copyrighted or whatever. :|
<Hooh54> 4And they want you to go to some stupid poll site
<Abbey1053> 14Oh yes.
<Booklyn_Lighthawk> Don't ask why I changed ponies.
<PsychicKid> I just
<B-Man> Actually.
<PsychicKid> Wanna wrap Fluttershy up in a blankey and squeeze her closely so she feels warm and safe
<Icydragon> 12I'm kidding, come here and get your hug.
<PsychicKid> 83
<Roleplay4life> 5There have been several people who've tried to upload subs of the first Pokémon movie and it ALWAYS gets deleted really fast. But not the dub. >:|
<ChobiPony> Gtg, dance class..be back in an hour or so c:
<PsychicKid> kyaaa doushio
<B-Man> Someone needs to remix "Cookin' by the Book"
<B-Man> With ponies.
<Abbey1053> 14._. I like my distance thanks
<B-Man> :D
<Hooh54> 4Well that's stupid
<Roleplay4life> 5UGH I hate those poll sites. xDD
<HyperMetalLugia> Problem really?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Roleplay4life> 5HML YES I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
<Sakuya> Again, I understand when the video itself is removed
<Icydragon> 12.... pwease... I good boi
<Roleplay4life> 5(Because it's my fave movie~)
<Booklyn_Lighthawk> Oh, gawd. At least it isn't "You are a pirate"
*Abbey1053 14briefly hugs icy then runs back
<Roleplay4life> 5I may /understand/ but that doesn't mean I agree with their policies necessarily. =P
<Booklyn_Lighthawk> I don't see any reason for there to be one for "You are a Pirate", as it's probably already done.
<Sakuya> dunno...for things like the story of young mewtwo
<Sakuya> Which is near impossible to find
<Icydragon> 12:3 dat wasn't so bad
<Sakuya> Those should be allowed up
<Booklyn_Lighthawk> Scratch that; there's no reason for it to even exist.
<Roleplay4life> 5I mean they put NEW SHOWS up for streaming all the time and yet a 13-year-old movie is more of a concern!?
<Sakuya> depends on the company
<Roleplay4life> 5Sakuya, actually that one's pretty easy to find. I've found it dubbed at then in raw Japanese.
<Sakuya> You realize that pokemon movies are taken down not because of youtube, but because of shogakuken
<kendle> How sad, I killed someone just by entering...
<Abbey1053> 14Aw I thought C7 would be active :X
<The_Linker> There's no reasons for someone to put Ponies to Starcraft 2, either.
<Roleplay4life> 5Mmm, yeah, I know.
<Roleplay4life> 5YT I have no issue with. xD
<The_Linker> *reason
<Icydragon> 12She's just doing her own thing
<Sakuya> Some companies are ok with stuff though, which is why mlp is completely on yt lol
<The_Linker> Ahh, Ponycraft.
<Hipster_Brony> 8bye chobi
<Hipster_Brony> 8is it blocked?
<Abbey1053> 14D:
<CaptainNR> hi
<Espeon> 06Well considering they can thank an audience outside their actual target audience for their success that's not too weird if you ask me :P
*Espeon flops
<Icydragon> 12She'll be back
<Booklyn_Lighthawk> Can anyone give me some advice on my 4 pony characters? --> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJoBTIs2NRZM_4kSRVAN2VqZQzwIGTPqKTfyK_CqZFs/edit?hl=en_US
<Sakuya> Lol
<Sakuya> Well there's that
<lightumbreon> !Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to lightumbreon for 12 minutes
<The_Linker> I first got into this when I saw the scene in there of Twilight casting a spell so intense she was wearing holes in the ground with her feet, and thought, 'This is not a normal little girl's cartoon'.
<Roleplay4life> 5And the entire Star Trek TOS series is on YT. ALL OF IT. EVERY EPISODE.
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate it the most when they take off OSTs :P
<HyperMetalLugia> !lightumbreon
*lightumbreon now belongs to HyperMetalLugia for 7 minutes
<PsychicKid> Twilight is love.
*lightumbreon eeps
<Roleplay4life> 5I tell ya that's a lot more popular and in demand than some obscure Jap' version a Pokeymanz movie.
<PsychicKid> Because she is purple.
<Abbey1053> 14Hopefully.
<kendle> I can relate to that statement.
<PsychicKid> Purple is the best color
<PsychicKid> Only because it's made up of red and blue, the best colors
<kendle> I agree with that too. But Pinkie Pie is the best. ^_^
<PsychicKid> I chose purple as a compromise :D
<kendle> XD
<Roleplay4life> 5Actually, I think Shopro is sometimes the issue... "This video contains content from Shopro, who has blocked it on copyright grounds."
<Icydragon> 12Anyways, how are doing?
<SirSprinkles> 6No, it just doesn't display like, anything.
<Abbey1053> 14I'm fine. How about you?
<Sakuya> Dunno, I remember all my videos going down cuz of shogakuken
<Roleplay4life> 5Like on a part of Shiro1987's vid part, "Myuutsu! Ware wa Koko ni Ari part 5"
<Tosxychor> Pinkie pie is no doubt the best pony for PMVing
<Abbey1053> 14Still doing your....thing?
<Hooh54> 4Yeah
<Tosxychor> but TS can't be dethroned in my list
<Hooh54> 4And hi to all the people who joined

<MPR> how do you use mibbit to get here?
<Princess_Celestia> your tyrant celestia demands a interveiw with fireant

<SirSprinkles> 6That's pretty much what it is now.
<CogWeaver> ._.
<Lurkingear> D:
<SirSprinkles> 6...and that's because /chat/ is non-pony randomness...
<kendle> The room is dark without the Princess...
<CaptainNR> yep
<kendle> Maybe that means Luna is near! Ooh
*Lurkingear luna!!!!
<SirSprinkles> 6...and /oat/ is supposed to be pony-related nonsense.
<Ghosties> 4Hmm
<Ghosties> 4Well, I see what you mean
<CogWeaver> Don't worry, I'll get Fire to come out here and makes some light *buhdumtsh!*
<Ghosties> 4But I thought chat wasn't meant to be serious? I thought it was just a chill place to post

<kendle> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, gala song!
<Unidentified1980> Ohai.
<SirSprinkles> 6It is.

<Fast-and-Free> StylusPick there was Elements of Discord though that was more Sauron-like
<Hooh54> 4For a second I thought you said Rolling in the Derp
<Robert_Glimmermane> Either that, or derpy became derpy from the baked bads.
<StylusPick> I see. and what about a story involving Zalgo ponies? I haven't noticed any
<Fast-and-Free> I am unfamiliar with zalgo ponies
<Lurkingear> no man, she was alrady derpying it since ep 1
<StylusPick> Luna Games 1, 2 and 3.
<Fast-and-Free> Didn't play any of those
<Tosxychor> there was a sweet little fic where derpy was derp-eyed because of poison oak
<Fast-and-Free> Comic you mean?
<Tosxychor> zecora kept giving her the cure, but those flowers were just too tasty for her XD
<Ghosties> 4Well, unfortunately, oat receives far more traffic than any board. And you can't exactly tell people to stop posting on oat
