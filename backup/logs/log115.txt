<DerpyBot> For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
<CogWeaver> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps CogWeaver
*KnightLight stolls away from his keyboard for a minute
<Natleyn> I'll leave when you do, then.
<LunaOnTheMoon> !mail Lyra socks
<BonBon> I think they'd look nice on you, Lyra.
*KnightLight *strolls
<Vakie> LOL!
<DerpyBot> Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
*Silvermane jumps slightly, startled. "Oh hey there Fluttershy."
<herospirit> It's only a few more minuets, so my mom at least probably doesn't care. :p
<Vakie> don't taze me bro!
<Lyra> But they're all old and worn out and tattered.
<BonBon> Gives them charm, I guess
<herospirit> Did he just die from a tazer shot? :0
<JackiePie> Derpy should write a book about the variety of muffins
<CrimsonFoxx> !mail LunaOnTheMoon shoes
<Dee> i want my PTX-140R Hardballer SooooOOOOooo bad
<Lyra> ...and now I have sox.
<Lyra> What the hay.
<MeteorVenture> that dude is so black he's blue
<herospirit> RIP Afro.
<DerpyBot> Sorry, I only carry mail for identified ponies.
<Natleyn> oh laws
<Natleyn> lawd*
*Fluttershy smiles. ^^ "Hi."
<Silvermane> 15Let's see, other things about wings...
<CogWeaver> the ponies in socks meme is dead guys
<LunaOnTheMoon> thank you crimsonFoxx...but I already have some slippers I wear..
<DecapKing> 4hey Fluttershy
<herospirit> Ohp, still alive
<CogWeaver> everyone knows it's ponies in sweaters that's the new meme
<Vakie> nah he still breathing.
*Lyra dips herself in chocolate.
*LunaOnTheMoon begs to differ. Luna in socks will always have a special place...
<HotCocoa> There, back to normal.
<DecapKing> 4they make you fly
<Dee> and whats next?
<Fluttershy> I'm sorry. I'm done with my very important thing now. ^^
<Dee> Ponies in Tanktops
<Balloons> Nah, socks will never die.
<Natleyn> inb4giantguitarartifactthatdestroyedoldguy'shouse
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Behold, the best space ship ever. Eventually.
<Balloons> !link socks
<MeteorVenture> idk what this is all about but i'm taking a strange liking to it
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/37315
<CogWeaver> according to Seth, socks is a dead meme
<DJMidli> seth lies
<FlutterWhat> best news set ever
<CogWeaver> of course, since when have we ever listened to Seth?
<DJMidli> a meme never dies that fast.
<Vakie> and now comes the goverment agenets!
<herospirit> So like, 5-10 mins more?
<Leika> Socks? I thought that the trend now was sweaters
<CrimsonFoxx> In my opinion, no meme can truly die completely
<BonBon> Well... I'd better get ahead of the game
<HotCocoa> I think Seth has a sup-SKETCHY_SOUNDS *brohoof*-eriority complex.
<DJMidli> seth has no concept of how a meme works because seth is not, in
<Natleyn> Hopefully.
<DJMidli> any
<DJMidli> way
<DJMidli> shape
<DJMidli> or form
<DJMidli> a channer
*BonBon puts on a Tuque
<Silvermane> 15Naturally, consistent stimulation to the body will result in erect wings, called popfeather or a wingboner. younger pegasi can't control it at all, and typically the wings spread straight up and out. With practice, you can control it to be in any direction, although making it retract is something even I can't do yet
<Ali1017> Stop the spam
<JackiePie> What's a Tuque?
<Silvermane> It's alright Shy-Shy. Glad you are back.
<HotCocoa> inb4 mute
<herospirit> I'll take a potato chip... AND EAT IT!!!
*DJMidli informs BonBon it's spelt toque (Canadian here i know what im talking about)
<CogWeaver> no mute, HotCocoa
<CogWeaver> not needed
<JackiePie> Ooh
<Fluttershy> Me too. -sighs with relief-
<MeteorVenture> YOU BLUE IT!
<Balloons> Heh, CogWeaver. You would've liked that picture.
<Natleyn> ^ <3
<Silvermane> What did you have to do?
<Dee> what is poutine?
<BonBon> (I'm canadian and I dont even know how to spell it)
<DJMidli> HotCocoa its me, they know im a pretty cool guy eh :P
<Thunder_Dash> heh, I need to watch Death Note sometime
<DecapKing> 4that sounds like my....
<HotCocoa> Certain mods are pretty quick to pull the trigger when someone posts more than thre elines in a row.
<DecapKing> 4nevermind
<Fluttershy> Hm... I'll tell you in a bit depending on how it all works out for me. ^^
*HotCocoa looks at Coz..
<MeteorVenture> ninja'd :P
<herospirit> I haven't seen enough Death Note. Only a few episodes
<BonBon> I think it's a fried potato dish with sauces Dee, though i've never had the craving for it.
<JackiePie> Toques look like upside down muffin cups
<Silvermane> 15During this time, bloodflow and electrical impulses are increased, so sensitivity is also increased.
<Vakie> so now they discover an FTL drive?!
<Silvermane> 15(and yes, very similar DecapKing)
*Sketchy_Sounds brohoofs HotCocoa
<MirthTinker> 13(my mom's on her...what 4th glass of wine? and she's being really rude, and even my dad is noticing she's not being reasonable)
<Dee> neat, but i'm scard to try it
<JackiePie> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine
<Silvermane> Oki Doki Loki
*Fluttershy hugs Silvermane. ^^
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Another tenish minutes
<Dee> has there been a Wizard of Oz Spinoff? of MLP?
<Silvermane> 15(oh my)
<HotCocoa> Sketchy_Sounds: you're under no obligation to stream now since I caught a bit of it earlier at work.
<DecapKing> 4sounds like fun
<BonBon> I've always preferred sour and bitter myself
<Dee> Fluttershy needs Courage
<CrimsonFoxx> That looks like it'd be pretty good
<MeteorVenture> too much colloidal silver
<MirthTinker> 13(just because I'm not searching for jobs RIGHT NOW with my 3 hours of available time, she's berating me for not being able to find the information she just pulled up and threw in my face)
*CogWeaver is about to lecture HotCocoa about poking at Coz when he does the best he can as a mod, but his attention is pulled away by the ADOWABLE APPLEJACK IN SOCK* /)^3^(\
*Silvermane hugs Fluttershy back. "Such a sweet filly"
<CrimsonFoxx> I love cheese curds
<herospirit> YES! WE SHOT MUSICIANS INTO SPACE
<Natleyn> Bye ladies
<MirthTinker> 13(my dad, sitting next to her, was actually defending me BLESS HIS HEART, and she got upset that he wasn't on her side)
<Vakie> punch it blue boys!
<Dee> A&W's Cheese curds in Chili ..yum
<herospirit> and they're like "oh wait didn't that guy kill everyone else in our race?"
*HotCocoa distracts CogWeaver with more Applejack.
<Skipsy> Yay! I finished my rainbow dash doodle, that turned into completed artwork. :D http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/Drawings/RainbowDash.png
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0What?
<Silvermane> lol DecapKing, i see what you did thar
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0He didn't.
<BonBon> Sometimes I have to watch my candymaking though. I've made ponies faces implode...
<Sketchy_Sounds> HotCocoa: Just as well, my flatmate is asleep and I don't wanna wake him.
<Natleyn> 68 minutes long, so this should be over soon.
<herospirit> Aww.
<DJMidli> i think the craziest is cheesburger poutine,
<Dee> thats awsom Skipsy
<Nashy> D:
<DecapKing> 4wait, where?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Best
<CrimsonFoxx> Not bad, Skipsy
<DJMidli> frenchfries, gravy, chedder melty cheese, and bucking hamburger meat.
<herospirit> I guess he just killed everyone on the one ship
<MirthTinker> 13(He's saying, 'well, I'd probably go there in person first,' wondering why she's saying that the internet is the final say on how to find it out, and why I'm not stupid for not looking at it immediately)
<Dee> One man Cheeseburger Apocalypse
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Space
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Ship

<Vakie> lol oh sure now it closes.
<DJMidli> yeah, smokes poutenirie has it locally
<MirthTinker> 13then I said, 'well, we think kinda similarly on that'
<Skipsy> hehe
<MirthTinker> 13and my mom just got all huffy
<MeteorVenture> DANG what is this?
<HotCocoa> Nice, Skipsy
<FlutterWhat> yeah except the Enterprise E could fire a quantum torpedo and destroy it
<AlphaOmega> My arteries are hardening just reading that
<Nashy> *yay*
<CrimsonFoxx> Has anyone ever tried something called a loco moco?
<herospirit> We can fly through space... with the power of RAWK
<Thunder_Dash> What the hell is going on?
<HotCocoa> 'Sup Cowguy.
<Dee> moco... Mucas
<Natleyn> yeah, this is the last song
<herospirit> Whhooooo Knooooows
<MirthTinker> 13like 'fine, go away, do your stupid games and stuff upstairs, I'm about to take it away altogether'
<CogWeaver> A loco moco, CrimsonFoxx? Are you loco in the cocoa?
<herospirit> Lol BBG.
<Dee> >.> is that the hair care product?
<Mongoose> Well I'm gonna go
<MrMooMoo> Hello cocoa.
<Vakie> PIR SHIELDS CAN'T TAKE DARKNESS OF THAT MAGNITUDE!
<Mongoose> Take Care!
<herospirit> Always BBG.
<MirthTinker> 13and she thinks I'm the unreasonable one...
<CogWeaver> bai Mongoose
<Silvermane> 15hrmm. sounds moderately worrisome
<Vakie> BBG comes in to save the day!
<CrimsonFoxx> No, that's actually what it's called, it's a Hawaiian dish.
<HotCocoa> l8r Mongoose

<BonBon> Meat? I didnt know this "Canada" had meat trees

<Vakie> "My ships shield's can't take fugly of that magnitude, so im saveing you. AGAIN."
<herospirit> ahahaha XD
<Thunder_Dash> "Even though I'm DEAD."
<MirthTinker> 13she was asking questions that had only one answer, ie "Why do you want to be _____ kind of person?"
<CrimsonFoxx> I've had Loco Moco before, it's really good.
<FlutterWhat> WY WAS IS THERE A MUSLIM SINGLES AD UP IN HERE
<MirthTinker> 13and the answer is: I don't, WELL WHY ARE YOU ACTING THAT WAY THEN?
<Vakie> "Yes! even though im dead and i somehow tackled him away from my ship."
<FlutterWhat> k it's gone

<herospirit> Someone get the drummer a mask
<FreezeFrame> From the EqD comments
<Dee> hiya
<BonBon> I dont quite understand what you're asking Dee, could you try rephrasing that?
<DecapKing> 4i was just pointing it out
<Fluttershy> Kinda PMed Silvermane to ask a question that had been bugging me. ><
<CogWeaver> ...and then I said "Oatmeal, are you delishious?" and it was all "Yes." and I was all "OMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM!!"
<Thunder_Dash> eh, close enough :P

<FreezeFrame> Because I am a 6' 2", 250 lb. huggy guy.
<Dashite> I can't hold a poker face against my family. At least not a super serious one.
<CogWeaver> of course, HotCocoa, you didn't think I was the only one who recognized that AJ was the best pony, did you?
*Thunder_Dash hugs FreezeFrame back

<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh Lyra. If only you had hands and could avoid typos more easily, hmm?
<BonBon> I'm sorry Lyra! I didn't mean it like that I just
<MeteorVenture> for some reason that dude immediately reminded me of the guy from higurashi
<MrMooMoo> Gilda is best pony.
*Lyra glares at Sketchy_Sounds.
<CogWeaver> Discord is the best chimera
<Nightmare_Dusk> I think a brony is trolling my computer... I found a folder in my pictures library called Princess Trollestias_files which has a bunch of random pony pictures and some pictures of people i know irl plus what looks like script files... was wondering if any of you might know what is going on?
<Thunder_Dash> Which one?
<Vakie> good evening to all, and to all a good night!
<Dee> I can't Choose, too many favorites
<MeteorVenture> idk.. i only watched season 1.. so the main guy i guess

<BonBon> Well thank you Dee, I dont hear that very often
<Nittany_Tiger_> Timeout
*CogWeaver trollfaces*
<Nashy> Is there a Princess Trollestrias.html too?
<Barry> Is that the name? So I am a Zombie?
<Nittany_Tiger_> And +M
<BlacklightWorking> …
<Nittany_Tiger_> *+N
<DecapKing> 4i learned not to mess with Polarfire again
<MrMooMoo> Spy is best pony.
<BlacklightWorking> Blueblood?!
<Sumica> in english yes
<BlacklightWorking> /Blueblood/?!
<BlacklightWorking> YOU ARE BUCKING KIDDING ME
<BonBon> Oh phew, she's gone
*Rarity aims a pie squarely at CogWeaver.
<MeteorVenture> i saw no problems with the dub.. if it wasn't faithful to the original words or not i don't know
<Silvermane> 15that's something to write to Celestia about right there...
<CogWeaver> aww, it cut off
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hahaha
<BlacklightWorking> lol
<Fooby> ...too long a topic?
<Rarity> URTOPICISTOOLOOONNNG
<BlacklightWorking> yes, we mad
<BonBon> Hooo, mare! I'm going to have it bad when I get home today.
<Dee> I'd Teach Blueblood the elements of Chivalry
<DecapKing> 4also that wings are kind of like my, nevermind.....
<Nightmare_Dusk> i dont see one
*Leika fangirls all over Rarity!
*Dashite writes up messages to celestia for kick messages...
<Thunder_Dash> Well, like I said, I haven't seen it, so... yeah :P
<Fluttershy> o-o
<MrMooMoo> Im not your mother
*Rarity revels in fangirlishness.
<Nashy> it would be in the same folder as the _files folder
<CogWeaver> okay, sorry people/ponies
<Fluttershy> This is very interesting so far.
<MeteorVenture> also i can tell this anime is going to be filled with fanservice.. oh joy
<Nashy> not inside the _files folder
<Silvermane> 15DecapKing, yes they are. ALthough typically you can't get a filly pregnant with them
<BonBon> Why does everypony hate Blueblood? I mean, he IS a prince.
<MeteorVenture> see? i win!
<MrMooMoo> No i dont like bananas.
<CrimsonFoxx> Leave the topic alone, it's not your personal tool to exploit and convey which Pony you like best.
<Nightmare_Dusk> ah ok, yeah there is
<DecapKing> wtf are we watching?
<Sumica> Basicly yes
<MirthTinker> 13yeah, I'll keep the physiology in mind...I was having fun until my mother yelled at me to come downstairs and see how incompetent I am (paraphrasing)
*Rarity glares at BonBon.
<Nashy> yup saved webpage, case closed
<Rarity> You want to know WHY?
<HaysforPonies> Cause he's huge douche.
<HaysforPonies> Bluh bluh.
<JackiePie> Chris Crocker: Leave the topic alllooooneee!
<Nightmare_Dusk> awesome. thanks for the help
<BonBon> Well dont look at ME rarity, YOU're the one who threw a cake at him
<Nashy> np
<MrMooMoo> Stop.
<Dee> ...brb someone is knocking at my door
<Leika> Hammer time!
<MrMooMoo> Waifu time.
<JackiePie> Leika I was thinking that
<CrimsonFoxx> Peanut Butta Jelly Time!
<MrMooMoo> Trololo
<Leika> I'm in your heaaaaad! Oooooohhhhh~~~
<Rarity> http://gallery.blakjak.net/d/3900-2/hammertime.gif
<Silvermane> 15hrmm, well you sound to me like you are working it through at a reasonable pace. Jobs are hard to find right now, not to mention balancing one with school
<MeteorVenture> aww what a noob still letting that criminal control the direction of his life even when he's back alive to live it
<HaysforPonies> I'm on a boat!
<HaysforPonies> What is this, meme song time?
<CogWeaver> I'm in space
*BonBon goes to buy make-up flowers for Lyra
<MrMooMoo> LIKE A BOSS
<Rarity> <Lyra> Yeah that's right, you better.
<Thunder_Dash> I dunno, if I got killed but had a chance to find out who it was, I'd want to
<CogWeaver> HIT THE SAUCE
<Nittany_Tiger_> Too late to play Dead Island :<
<MeteorVenture> sure sure.. but i wouldn't devote my life to it
<MrMooMoo> poniesponiesponies
<MirthTinker> 13well, I haven't really been actively pursuing a job, my last one kind of fell through when they fired my dad (they were reluctant to hire his kid right after firing him)
<Rarity> ..swag.
*Leika licks Rarity to see if she tastes of marshmellows >.>
*Rarity goes travelling.
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah
<MeteorVenture> i wouldn't be all about vengeance though
<Silvermane> 15mm i see
<Rarity> Take me away, horn!
<CrimsonFoxx> She should, Leika, she IS the element of Marshmellow!
*Razyn_the_Pony 11puts on his transmission lenses. "Time to go. Have fun everypony."
<MrMooMoo> Need a dispenser here!
<Silvermane> 15nothing i can advise without being nearby to help during fallout
<Dee> omg! i thought i was introuble with some mafia, a group of three came near my home asking for $1.00 in quarters, they did look like thugs, totally... so scared now
<Silvermane> 15later Razyn
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Ja ne
<MirthTinker> 13yeah, I know, it just kinda sucks sometimes
<MrMooMoo> HOLY CRAP 1 DOLLER.
<Leika> Just laugh Dee!
<Thunder_Dash> ... Wow, between the zombie protagonist looking like Keiichi, and this girl who... frankly looks like Rena, IMO, this is reminding me a lot of Higurashi
*JackiePie erects a dispenser
<Nashy> 1 dollar, now that's gangsta.
<JackiePie> There you go!
<Silvermane> 15yes it does. any chance of staying in a dorm?
<Dee> i did after i closed the door
<Sumica> Same art team
<Rarity> As Pinkie Pie says, you must "giggle at the ghosties." Or something.
<Solo> CogWeaver: Is it a non-newtonian sauce?
<Solo> CogWeaver: If so, it just might hit back
<Thunder_Dash> Studio Deen made this too?
<Silvermane> 15or is it not financially logical, sorta like my situation (5 minutes from campus)
<Sumica> iirc yeah
<CrimsonFoxx> I once answered the door and this guy told me that he was here for Papa John's pizza...And I hadn't even ordered a pizza...He didn't look dangerous though, and he left when I said I didn't know what he was talking about.
<MeteorVenture> i guess they only learned how to draw 1 look
<Dee> i gave em 2 bucks in pocket change, mostly quarters. yay genorisity
<Leika> That's Rarity's turf!
<JackiePie> Did he have a pizza in hand Crimson?
<Sumica> it's common
<CrimsonFoxx> No, it sounded like he was trying to get a free meal off of someone to be honest.
<JackiePie> Yeah that's not cool, and his attempt to claim he was from Papa Johns, is super lame
<RobotPinkie> morning, ponies
<JackiePie> It's going to be obvious with no pizza
<Solo> Hmmm. Troll logic:
<Sumica> Sup RobotPinkie
<Thunder_Dash> just checked Wikipedia since it's such a reliable source of info, and yeah, it says Deen made both
<Solo> Newton despised alcohol
<Solo> therefore alcohol is a non-newtonian liquid.
<Dee> i thought they needed money for the payphone
<Thunder_Dash> hi, Pinkie
<Rarity> Wait, what is my turf?
*Rarity looks at her hooves.
<MeteorVenture> i would beat her up later
<CrimsonFoxx> No, he didn't say he was from Papa John's, he said he was there FOR Papa John's Pizza
<Dee> Generosity
<JackiePie> Oh, still
<Rarity> Dee: oohhh.
<BonBon> Oh dearest Lyra! The apple of my eye! Would a mare as lovely and sweet as thee agree to spend the rest of our- Oh wait.. wrong cue card... heheh
<RobotPinkie> what's streaming?
<MeteorVenture> anyway i guess that's where i stop watching.. man i hate fanservicey shows
<JackiePie> I wouldn't answer the door for any stranger unless they were on fire, or had a fire at their house or something.
<MirthTinker> 13I live less than 20 minutes from campus
<MirthTinker> 13it would be kinda dumb
<Rarity> I'm not the ONLY pony in Equestria who is allowed to be generous, you know.
<Dee> keep going Bonbon
<MirthTinker> 13and the school has no dorm also
<JackiePie> You can't trust people, the guy might've been trying to steak out your house to see if anyone was home so he could rob it.
<Silvermane> 15ah
<Silvermane> 15well sympathy brosis
<Leika> But it is your element!
<BonBon> Ah here we go. Lyra, I'm sorry for insert blunder here. Please forgive me.
<Filter> Poor Skipsy
<MrMooMoo> And theyll take yo ponies.
*MirthTinker 13*brohoof*
<CrimsonFoxx> Well, sometimes strangers can be interesting, my mom and I once spent a couple hours talking with a couple of guys who came to our door.
<Sumica> Gonna go back to Burn notice after this.
<Rarity> <Lyra> ...okay fine.
<Filter> hes in there all alone, singing to himself
<MirthTinker> 13I'll figure this out somehow
<Nashy> :(
<Silvermane> 15*brohoof*
<Filter> and playing the keyboard
<JackiePie> Crimson that's fine, if you want to take a risk with your life
<BonBon> Oh thank you! I promise it will never happen again!
<MirthTinker> 13she'll probably let up when I get a job or something...hopefully
<Skipsy> lol, ok Filter, I'll stop streaming and continue singing to myself. :P
<Filter> OW
<Filter> MY EARS
<MirthTinker> 13she mentioned I'd also have to join a club or bible study
<MrMooMoo> Hide yo ponies Hide yo waifu..
<Silvermane> 15hmmm
<Filter> forgot to turn down the volume...
<Skipsy> lol
<MirthTinker> 13so I'm guessing she's going to hold that over my head as well for leverage
<MeteorVenture> what's burn notice?
<Dee> Can i add anypony to my PSN?
<Nashy> Don't live in such a horrid place that you need to be scared.
<Sumica> spy show/ MacGyver
<MrMooMoo> Yes.
<Filter> you could, but i dont play
<JackiePie> I don't, I'm just not stupid.
*Rarity disguises herself as a mafia hitpony and knocks on JackiePie's door.
<MeteorVenture> ah then heck ya! just let me know when that happens
<MirthTinker> 13she wanted me to keep a fucking journal, plotting my activity throughout the day and the exact amount of time I spent doing each thing (to validate me being on the computer too much) I got in trouble when I suggested I could keep a log of my bowel movements :P
*JackiePie ignores
<MrMooMoo> I dont play much anymore since i discoverd tf2
<Dee> No Solicitors
<Leika> That doesn't sound like something a lady would do o.o
<Sumica> 10 min or so.
<RobotPinkie> and what's this?
*Polarfire takes note of the dusty floors and walls, decrepit furniture and cobwebs
<Silvermane> 15sounds a bit of a smartass thing to say. but clever come back all the same
<Sumica> "so I am a zombie"
<DecapKing> 4charming
<Nashy> Sounds like irrational fear to me.
<Filter> Scarity
<MirthTinker> 13isn't it?
<CrimsonFoxx> I have a PS3, though I only have a few games.
<RobotPinkie> ...okay
<JackiePie> *sigh* okay Nashy whatever
<Nashy> But it's your door.
<MirthTinker> 13I've apologized since then for being a smartass there, but did not for disliking the journal
<JackiePie> Yup
<VioletVanilla> 6I have been up 46. . .
<CrimsonFoxx> I can't wait for Sonic Generations to come out
<Filter> Poor door, you will never be forgotten
<JackiePie> There are irrational fears and rational fears, and one of those rational fears is not to let strangers into your house.
<JackiePie> That's just common sense
<Silvermane> I work for a living, so staying awake is not logical. speaking of, when Shy-Shy gets back, i'm heading to bed
<Silvermane> 15hrmm
<Leika> Stranger danger?
<Nashy> Don't need to let them in.
<VioletVanilla> 6I work for a living as well Silvermane. . .
<JackiePie> Better to be alive an irrationally fearful, then welcoming and dead
<RobotPinkie> I'm watching some Doctor Who instead.
<VioletVanilla> 6I also do full-time University work as a Music student.
<Silvermane> i drive and run heavy machinery
<Silvermane> falling asleep is extremely dangerous for me
<BonBon> None of the ponies in ponyville really lock their doors. Except when another monster comes by every week or so
<HotCocoa> No, I'd rather die of my own stupidity than live my life in a cage.
<Nashy> False dilemma.
*Sumica makes a note to not show this one again. =p
<MrMooMoo> Nice way to think
<VioletVanilla> 6Ah~ I understand. . . I want you to be safe. . .
<DecapKing> 4i smuggle stuff
<JackiePie> So can we change the subject from this drama, of who can be the most careless?
<Filter> I already dont let religious recruiters in, i dont see why i would let the mafia come inside
<Sketchy_Sounds> poniesponiesponies
<Dee> when i die, i wanna die fighting
<CrimsonFoxx> It used to take me three grown men to subdue me when I was younger, I'm pretty sure I could at least slow down anyone who tried anything.
<MirthTinker> 13well, I'm going to bed, before she can get mad at me for the time I'm not spending not doing things
<MrMooMoo> SWOG
<Sketchy_Sounds> PONIES
<Silvermane> If i were doing normal work like talking to patients or handling computers, i might be able to pull longer sleep-deprivations... but I just love to sleep to much
<HotCocoa> Swog? Isn't that a Swedish beer or something?
<Dee> Duff
<Nashy> I always keep in mind the probabilities.
<RobotPinkie> oh you're streaming? wut?
<HotCocoa> Oh hey, the file transfer is done.
<BonBon> Where are you all from? Fighting? Danger from Strangers? This sounds just terrible
<Silvermane> plus i have a crappy intern-grunt-labor job
<MirthTinker> 13(I know it sounds really huffy of /me/ to say that, but we've been through this a bunch of times and I ran out of things to say to her eventually)
<JackiePie> We're from Earth
<Sumica> yarr
<CogWeaver> that's something I've always wondered about...if Ponyville gets attacked by monsters and has bad things happen to it so much, why doesn't Celestia just send guards down to Ponyville to protect it against predators and intrusive monsters and the like?
<Dee> sorry Bonbon
*HotCocoa snickers
<BonBon> Ear- th?
<MrMooMoo> We from da Everfree beeyoch.
<VioletVanilla> 6D'awwwww. . . v.v You poor pony. . .
<Silvermane> 15alright. night mirthtinker. I understand circular arguments and pointless patterns well enouogh
<RobotPinkie> and it's just that I missed the beginning... I don't like just jumping in in the middle of an anime
<MirthTinker> 13hehe
<Dee> who will defend them from the Hydra?
<Silvermane> hehe, only a few more weeks, then I'm back to school full time again
<MirthTinker> 13well, she's allowed to use em, I'm just not allowed to point it out :P
<Nashy> Life is a series of calculated risks.
<VioletVanilla> 6~yay~
<Silvermane> i work and school in 3 month shifts. part of the program
<BonBon> That librarian pony and her friends usually do a good enough job
<MirthTinker> 13(basically giver her the answers she needs or else)
<DecapKing> 4i would still point them out
<AtomicGone-y> BBL.
<MirthTinker> 13haha, and I still do
<CogWeaver> BonBon: Earth is another planet that those "hyoo-mans" are from
*Silvermane enjoys the pity though >.>
<Dee> but they only subdue it Bonbon, just like batman, Joker(Hydra) will be back, with tricks
<MrMooMoo> We're from a different planet?
<MirthTinker> 13anyway, goodnight, hopefully I'll be back to normal schedules soon enough to...ehem...show you what I've learned
<BonBon> Another planet? Oh my. How are we talking exactly?
<DecapKing> 4cause he has no self esteem
<CogWeaver> magic
<Filter> duh
<CogWeaver> and some technology
<MirthTinker> 13*kiss* night Silvermane
<BonBon> Oh. Dugh
<MrMooMoo> Tubes.
<Thunder_Dash> oh boy...
<BonBon> I'm not a clever pony
<Leika> The interwebs!
<Silvermane> 15oh my. well it should wear off in just under an hour. *kiss* night Tinkerbelle
<Filter> cups and strings
<Filter> really long strings
*VioletVanilla giggles~
<Dee> Combination between Magic Technology, and Intermeshing Electric Wavelengths
<Leika> And cookies
<VioletVanilla> 6You are silly pony. .. but good to see you are hard-working too!
*MirthTinker 13goes to bed to clop with her new wings-oops did I just say that? ;)
<Filter> ja
<MrMooMoo> And a Delorean
<CogWeaver> that's getting technical, though
<Silvermane> 15don't mess with them too much, or you may get light headed. and don't pull or twist any feathers
<BonBon> Well yes Dee but running around and hiding worked pretty well for us so far. I'm sure even without twilight's help we'd be fine
<CogWeaver> don't need to go into details at this point
<DecapKing> 4*play "self esteem" by the offspring
<Nashy> 4th wall communication router inside Sugarcube Corner.
<MrMooMoo> And milk.
<CogWeaver> SHH!
<Filter> Perhpas
<DecapKing> 4bow chicka wow wow
<CogWeaver> DON'T MENTION THE PINK ONE HERE!
<BonBon> Oh. so It's pinkie being... herself
<Silvermane> 15hmm, should i have told her what happens if you maintain constant suction pressure on them?
<Dee> Build a Wall like the Chiniese did to keep the huns out
<Filter> We're not mentioning Pinkie now?
<CogWeaver> SHH!
*MirthTinker 13is still here, looking at your responses
<Filter> does that mean we can mention cupcakes? :D
<CHAENNE> hey i know its early, but just so i can wite it down, what time will season 2 air on the 17th?
<Dee> nope
<DecapKing> 4i can only answer that if i knew what would happen
<Filter> aww
<Silvermane> I'm just a poor boy...
<MrMooMoo> Muffcakes.
<Thunder_Dash> 9AM EST, IIRC
<BonBon> Feel free to build a wall Dee, she'll just pop out of the nearest flowerpot on the other side
<Sumica> correct
<CHAENNE> thank you
<MirthTinker> 13okay, NOW I'm going to bed, for real
<Silvermane> also, I only like 'Self Esteem' because of that Spike PMV from Anthology
<MirthTinker> 13foreelz
<Sumica> ok back to normal stuff.
<Fluttershy> back yet again... ^^;
<MirthTinker> 13...kay-oh, night you lurkers
<CrimsonFoxx> If Pinky can get somewhere before Rainbow Dash does, I don't think a wall would really help much.
<Silvermane> 15night tinkerbelle.
<Dee> well i'm stumped.
<VioletVanilla> 6Willkommen Flootershy~
<Silvermane> 15i'm out too once Fluttershy is back. need to glomp her once more
<Dashite> Later!
<Filter> I dont think she gets there before RD, i think she just breaks the fabric of time
<Ghosties> 4AW YEAH
<DecapKing> 4hey Fluttershy
<TrollightSparkle> Hey
<Ghosties> 4Bruce Campbell
*Fluttershy jumps, eyes widen. "A-Ah..."
<Sumica> Suddenly Ghosties
*Silvermane glomps Fluttershy. "I SAID I'D DO IT!"
<MirthTinker> 13 /gasp mfw Silvermane is cheating on me with my favpony
<Dee> Pinkie would probably draw on it
<Leika> Are we talking about Pinkie Pie?
<Sumica> Hi TrollightSparkle
<Filter> ja
<Ghosties> 4Bruce Campbell always gets my attention
<VioletVanilla> 6Sie sind sich schön~
<Silvermane> 15i'm not cheating.
<Nittany_Tiger_> What was that anime?
<Silvermane> 15(yet)
*Fluttershy squeaks, falls onto the ground. x-x
<MrMooMoo> Throw rocks at her.
<Silvermane> 15:D
<MirthTinker> 13rarityfaint
<Nashy> I think it's more of moving two points closer together.
<Nashy> Using additional dimensions.
<Silvermane> 15oh relax, if it isn't in silvershipper it isn't canon
<Filter> Oh
<Dashite> Woo! More Burn Notice!
<MirthTinker> 13otay :(
<MirthTinker> 13NIGHT :D
<Sumica> So I am a zombie Nittany_Tiger_
<Silvermane> German?
<DecapKing> 4what about beauty Violet?
<Filter> !flip
*DerpyBot flips a muffin
*DerpyBot catches the muffin with her hoof, upside down
*Silvermane scoops up the fainted Fluttershy, and props her against a tree.
<Leika> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<BonBon> I was flying a kite when the fliers competition rainboom happened... Sure I'm glad rarity didnt die but... I loved that kite
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Leika in a tight embrace
<Dee> How would ponies adjust to a human civilazation? Pegasus in Jetplane turbines
*BonBon tearyface
<Silvermane> 15Love you <3
<Silvermane> 15night
<MrMooMoo> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<Filter> deargod
*Silvermane 15is such a dog
<Silvermane> Crap, id idn't kill her did I?
*Fluttershy wakes up a bit later, blinking. "Ohh... my head..."
<VioletVanilla> 6I was saying she is beautiful, DecapKing
<MrMooMoo> Oh derpy...
<Silvermane> oh good
<Filter> Atleast it would kill a plane full of people too
<Filter> we need pop control
<Sumica> OH look "plot"
<Silvermane> sorry Fluttershy, didn't mean to startle you.
<CogWeaver> the only way you keep Pinkie away from you is to not make any sort of comedic entrance for her in any way, and keep her out of your thoughts, conversations, and promises
<Dee> As Lily would say "The Horror, The Horror"
*Fluttershy sweatdrops. "It's alright..." ^^;
<TrollightSparkle> This looks interesting
<BonBon> Don't make fun of Lilly!
<Dee> but wouldn't that hurt her, like tinkerbell?
<Filter> Lock yourself in a room for the rest of your life, a white room, with nothing in it
<Filter> and nothing on it
<Silvermane> Alright, well I need to head off to bed now. Here, keep this blanket if you get sleepy again. No more coffee beans for tonight, ay?
<BonBon> Being shocked is a perfectly rational reaction to terrified bouncing bushels of baby bunnies
<Xiagu|PastSins> Roseluck also says ``The horror, the horror!''
<Dee> and go cold turkey
<CogWeaver> no, Dee, Tinkerbell and other fairies only get hurt of someone shouts:
<CogWeaver> I DO NOT BELIEVE IN FAIRIES!
<Filter> neither do i
<MrMooMoo> Cosmoo
*AlphaOmega claps so that the fairies will live
*Filter MWAAHAHAHAHAHHA
<CrimsonFoxx> I wonder why there hasn't been any fairies in this show yet.
<Dee> Just quoting her Bonbon, not making fun of her, Shes so cute btw
<MeteorVenture> chocolate coffee beats are where it's at
<MeteorVenture> but anyway take care:D
<CogWeaver> CrimsonFoxx: Parasprites
<Silvermane> lol night Metero
<Silvermane> meteor
<CogWeaver> they're more like bugs in this 'verse
<Silvermane> 15night everypony
<Filter> They do look suspiciously like navi though
<Sumica> Love all the little spy tips.
<Silvermane> night everypony
<CrimsonFoxx> Technically, those are sprites, sprites and fairies aren't the same thing.
<MeteorVenture> metero sounds like a spell from final fantasy
<DecapKing> 4night Silvermane
<Sumica> Night Silvermane
<Thunder_Dash> Seeya, Silvermane
<Silvermane> peace Decap
<CogWeaver> parasite sprites
<Nashy> Bugs.
<TrollightSparkle> night silvermane
<CogWeaver> ^
<Silvermane> night Polarfire, Fluttershy, GGgala, Denied_Existence...
<Fluttershy> Ah, you're going...? :< Goodnight, Silvermane. Sleep well!
<Polarfire> night Silvermane
<Dee> Do ponies... wish upon a star? "Begins singing "When you Wish upon a Star"
<Silvermane> VioletVanilla, DPrince-Dari... i think that's everyone
<AlphaOmega> I think of them as tiny winged tribbles
<Silvermane> aeeyup, i'm off Shy-Shy.
<MeteorVenture> i call it.. copy hasta! (la vista)
<CogWeaver> no, because the last pony who did that, Dee, felt the wrath of Luna because she thought her stars were being abused
<Fluttershy> Alright... goodnight!
*Silvermane facehoofs.
<BonBon> Yeah I know Dee, the way she tends to her flowers I wonder how she'd.... I mean.. *hur-ha-hem* Stallions and stuff.. Grrrrr
<Silvermane> night
<CrimsonFoxx> When you said that, Dee, I immediately started wondering what it would be like if the ponies ever met the Aristocats.
<Silvermane> ... hasta la vista... *groan*
<MeteorVenture> lol
<MeteorVenture> hasta la vista filly
<Leika> I wonder what would Poison Joke do to BonBon... >.>
<CrimsonFoxx> I mean, both groups of animals are very musically inclined, obviously.
<Dee> OOOoooOh, Barry White is playing in the next house

<Sumica> ahhh
<Dashite> But dat plot is pretty good as well.
<TrollightSparkle> I've not heard of this show.. when did it come out?
<BonBon> Uhhhmmm... *goes to apply more poison joke*
<Leika> More Apples BonBon? XD
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodnight DecapKing! (:
<Dashite> About 5 years ago.
<BonBon> Please Leika, thats not my finest moment.
*BonBon mutters "I'm still looking for a way to make it up to her"
<Fluttershy> Hm? Yeah o-o
<TrollightSparkle> Hmm.
<CogWeaver> BonBon + PJ = Normal voice; Lyra + PJ = Human form; Colgate + PJ = Wooden teeth; Berry Punch + PJ = completely, 100% sober
<BonBon> Berry Punch? Sober?
<Fluttershy> I was just checking my deviantART messages.
<CrimsonFoxx> I wonder if Applejack has a Japanese cousin named Fuji.
<BonBon> What world do you live in CogWeaver?
<CogWeaver> on Poison Joke, she might be, BonBon
<Dee> Scenario: Lyra Comes home witha golden ticket to Willy Wonkas Chocalate Factory. Will you sing "I've got a Golden Ticket" Bonbon?
<CogWeaver> and Equestria, just like you
<BonBon> Umm.. I DO like to sing. But I can tell Lyra tries her best to be nice when I do sing. I wouldn't want to dampen her high.
<Nashy> Why does Lyra stalk Twilight?
<BonBon> She does what now?
<Nashy> Stalks Twilight.
<CogWeaver> because she's been sent on a mission by Celestia to keep an eye on her student, Nashy
<BonBon> Ooooooh Lyra has got some explaining to do...
<CogWeaver> she doesn't stalk Twi
<CogWeaver> she's just on a special mission
<Dee> *Audience OOOOooohs*
<Leika> Lyra actually has a crush on Twilight, but shhhhh! It's a secret!
<CogWeaver> ~Lyyyyra, you got some splainin' to doooo!
<Filter> Poor Bonbon...
<BonBon> Well if she ever finishes her mission, I hope she can stay. I'd miss her terribly if she left
<BonBon> Leikda.. WHAT?
<Nashy> She's in Canterlot all "Hello want to be my friend? Come to the party!"
<Xiagu|PastSins> CogWeaver, don't you mean Lyra + PJ = normal horse form?
<Leika> Noooooothing~
<CogWeaver> nono, she turns human on PJ
<MeteorVenture> argh it's burn notice already?
<Nashy> Then follows Twilight to Ponyville. And even to Cloudsdale!
<Xiagu|PastSins> CogWeaver, but that's what she wants!
<CogWeaver> and Colgate gets wooden teeth
<Dashite> Shall we shoot them? /irish accent
<BonBon> I.. I... I mean... I dont care. Why should I care? Good for her.
*Ghosties 4cannot see for the life of himself why Michael's romantic interest is a woman with a horse's face
<CogWeaver> and BonBon actually gets an acceptable voice
<Dee> She hocked for Booze money like George Washington?
<Nashy> Stalker :G
<CogWeaver> ...no offense, BonBon
<MeteorVenture> ^ inb4
*BonBon looks down
<Dashite> Because you have horrible taste Ghosties.
<BonBon> none taken..
<Xiagu|PastSins> haha
<CogWeaver> no, seriously, all of us ponies think your voice is great
<CogWeaver> it's them hyoomans, though
<Filter> Yea!
<CogWeaver> their ears are messed up or something
*Xiagu|PastSins gives BonBon a hug anyway
<BonBon> Well then **** them
<Sumica> it will be FUn™
*BonBon neckhugs Xiagu back
<Leika> Oh dear... o.o
<Nashy> This human is going to sleep...
<Leika> What a fowl language!
<Dee> ;3; I don't look at the species, i look at whats behind there eyes
<AlphaOmega> such tiny ears those hairless apes have
<Ghosties> 4I bet Dashite's the kind of man that thinks Sarah Jessica Parker is attrative too
<CogWeaver> they're not hairless apes, actually
<Ghosties> 4*attractive
<CogWeaver> they look more like bi-pedaled pigs
<BonBon> I know Leika, I'm just very concious about my voice
<Dashite> Uh... no.
<Dee> In the Summer, some have hair on there backs and shoulders, like a Gorilla
<CogWeaver> everypony has at least one problem
<Ghosties> 4Good
<CogWeaver> yours ISN'T your voice, though, BonBon
<Ghosties> 4Because she actually is a horse face...ugh
<MeteorVenture> sitting on a radio tower will as well
<MeteorVenture> (assuming cell phones even do)
<BonBon> What is it then? Is my hair not poofy enough?
<CogWeaver> idk, I don't know you enough
<Dee> My Flaw is I'm VERY Forgetfull
<CogWeaver> I'm usually held up in my lab most days
<MeteorVenture> i heard a story
<JackiePie> Dr. Michio Kaku was discussing how you could theoretically go back in time and meet your parents before they were your parents.
<CogWeaver> don't get out to see most ponies
<CogWeaver> not often, at least
<JackiePie> I'm thinking, "But Dr. Kaku, what about breaking the space time continnum?!"
<BonBon> I'm sorry to hear that Cog
<CrimsonFoxx> There's a rap song about Cupcakes on Celestia Radio right now...
<Dee> It is Irrelevant, time is merly a Illusion
<VioletVanilla> 6I enjoyed your drawings earlier! It is nice to see some artistic talent around here. c:
<Xiagu|PastSins> JackiePie, it depends on how time travel works in the universe you're in
<Dashite> DAT PLOT
<Hayfever> pre-hoo.
<CogWeaver> and even if it wasn't an illusion, traveling through it would still be impossible because you create a paradox the moment you even DECIDE to go back (given that you COULD in the first place)
<Xiagu|PastSins> are they resolving it with stable time loops and only 1 timeline, or did they take the easy way and say time travel jumps to alternate universes/timelines

<HaysforPonies> I did NOT see that coming. @.@
<Fluttershy> ^^ Aw, thanks.
<Xiagu|PastSins> haha that Lyra comic
<Xiagu|PastSins> hoo
<Dee> heh.. zipper
<Filter> missed the link
<BonBon> Umm...
*Filter feels left out
<Sumica> Nice use of tape.
<Hayfever> Heww.

<Dee> open Home in a new tab
<AlphaOmega> twice
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<Dee> Bonbon, could you tell me when you first me lyra?
*BonBon aside from her brilliant eyes and the sheen of her mane when it was we- umm.. Oooh this pebble is neart
<MeteorVenture> pillz here!
<Filter> lol
<Thunder_Dash> Grabbin' pills
<HaysforPonies> Up and up I go
<HaysforPonies> Though quite slowly.
<CogWeaver> that is one neart pebble, BonBon
<CogWeaver> very neart
<BonBon> Oh. Well Lyra had just moved in from canterlot and was looking for a place to stay. Now she's not a major musician or anything so she doesn't make much, if anything at all. Poor girl. Anyways, I offered her a cheaper board solution by offering to co-house together
<MeteorVenture> macgyver is better :|
<BonBon> I LOVE neart things Cogweaver
<TrollightSparkle> I know I'ma get bashed for this.. but what's Macgyver?
<Dashite> Richard Dean Anderson before Stargate
<MeteorVenture> an old show that most of us probably know from our childhoods
<MeteorVenture> it's kind of similar to this.. the dude narrates stuff and does smart things and all
<BonBon> Kite murderer.
<Xiagu|PastSins> ^ wut
<CogWeaver> she thinks RD murdered her kite
<MeteorVenture> and keeps a sense of humor through all of it
<BonBon> It was like a sister to me
<Dee> Why is Your Figurine so Expensive BonBon? I wants it.. like a Monkey wants a Banana
<Thorinair> hey
<BonBon> Figurine? I wasn
<BonBon> 't aware that people sold me
<CogWeaver> in the hyooman world, they have little figurine versions of us
<mib_60p4qg> Elloooo?
<Thunder_Dash> Hi
<Sumica> Hello
<BonBon> Oh really? thats- odd
<CogWeaver> it's almost freaky at how much the hyoomans go gaga for us pony-folk
<Dee> http://tinyurl.com/3trxdy2 there you go Bonbon, See How pretty it is
<TrollightSparkle> Hello
<mib_60p4qg> Oh NOW the chat thing loads. And my name sucks.
<VioletVanilla> 6Mmmm, well dearie, I am heading to bed. It is 7AM and I must be up in an hour. Good talking! ^.^ See/hear you on the stream soon again!
*Xiagu|PastSins has so many ponies
<BonBon> Awww, now isnt that just the spitting image of yours truly
<Dee> and i have none. ;3; want at least one of my Favs
<Fluttershy> Alright. Good night--or rather, morning? Ehehe... ^^; Later~
*Xiagu|PastSins should be getting a Roseluck soon
<Solo> Hey guys.
<Solo> http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q243/Lypilykos/Spike.jpg
<Derpy_RDN> Thats slightly better.
<MeteorVenture> i don't know this show but dang it seems like it's totally copying macgyver with a little new age junk thrown in.. just saying
<sotha> It's okay, mibasdwe4rp98. Don't worry about it. For your information, mibasdeeeeqg is one of my favourite names.
<Solo> Remember scootaloo's comment from Cutie Mark Chronicles about where she heard about ziplining from?
<Xiagu|PastSins> Solo, nope
<Sumica> You so silly Sol
<CogWeaver> Spike looks kinda chunky in that pic
<Xiagu|PastSins> ^
<Balloons> >
<CogWeaver> v
<Solo> Sweetie Belle said "Are you sure about this? I've never even heard of a pony ziplining before"
<Solo> and scootaloo said, "Spike said it was awesome"
<Dee> Night Everypony, this "Hyoo-mon" has got to get to work in the mornin'
<Leika> Huh... so Lyra is a human in a pony costume, that's how she can sit down like she does...
<CogWeaver> nn Dee
<BonBon> Oh I'm sure it's just a silly comic Leika. There's no way it could.. possibly.. be true.. heheh
<Xiagu|PastSins> Solo, that is correct. Whoa. I never registered that before...
<Solo> Xiagu: Heheh. I know. That's kinda the point.
<Leika> Are you suuuuuuure? I mean, she's the only one who can sit down diferently than any other pony!
<Luna> 07Goodnight everypony
<CogWeaver> there is no way for that to be true, BonBon - our worlds are millions of light-years apart
<Dashite> Night Luna
<Sumica> Night Luna
<Thunder_Dash> Night, Luna
<sotha> so, instead of using bubble gum and a paper clip to defuse a bomb, he uses an iPad and an omniblade?
<Luna> 07time to hit the hay HARD!
<CogWeaver> the only way a hyoomon could get here is through magic
<DibromYAY> night luna
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodnight everypony~
<TrollightSparkle> Night Luna!
<BonBon> Well.. I guess that makes sense. But isn't magic everywhere?
<TrollightSparkle> And night Vanilla!
<CogWeaver> and I'm pretty sure that they don't have magic, and no pony here would want those guys here at all
<Dashite> Don't hit it too hard! You might hurt yourself!
<Leika> Lyra is a spy!
<Xiagu|PastSins> Don't forget that friendship is magic too
<Sumica> Well in this case a microwave and a metal santa to make a bomb.
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodnight, goodnight! Until the morning light!
<Luna> 07enjoy the rest of the night / day .. see you at the streaming test !
<BonBon> ... Now I'm worried again
<CogWeaver> *they don't have /useable/ magic
<Leika> They have TECHNOLOGY!
<CogWeaver> YES
<CogWeaver> ...some WE need more of!
<CogWeaver> *something
<BonBon> oh you mean like magnets?
<RobotPinkie> night Luna
<Leika> How do they work anyway?
<Thorinair> http://recycletiger.deviantart.com/art/10-ways-of-flirting-meme-257201710
<BonBon> I think magic is the answer
<CogWeaver> no, like electricity and motors and light-bulbs and non-magical things
<Xiagu|PastSins> Magnets are powered by friendship
<BonBon> Awww arent they adorable together?
<Xiagu|PastSins> they're friends will all ferrous materials
<Xiagu|PastSins> with, even
<MrMooMoo> Just read... Wait what did i just read.
<Thorinair> its so cute
<Leika> So... how come you didn't know who the aparently only fashionista in ponyville was BonBon? It is a small town after all... right?
<Thorinair> D:
<BonBon> That was more of a metaphorical thing Leika
<MeteorVenture> you know that song by rush called tom sawyer? well that was the opening and closing themes to macgyver over in brazil
<Leika> Metaphorical?
<BonBon> Rarity has some good designs but she doesn't have the acclaim that other designers do
<BonBon> I may have been a bit too rude though,
<TrollightSparkle> Pretty sweet
<BonBon> Spur of the moment thing. Heh.
<MeteorVenture> ya
<Leika> I think you might have hurt her feelings there
<BonBon> I know. And you know what scares me?
<BonBon> Sometimes I think I don't care.
<Leika> Eeeevil!
<CogWeaver> ...Celestia forbid THAT from ever happening...
<CogWeaver> 9.9
<BonBon> I dont WANT to be like that... it just scares me
<CogWeaver> alright, I'm going to bed now, people and ponies
<CogWeaver> good night
<Leika> Night night!
*SouthernCross spots the update about the Aussie Pony competition... wanders off to enter
<BonBon> Good night Cogweaver. I hope to see you soon
<Sumica> MacGyver did't have a meta story though.
*Leika attempts to sit like Lyra does... only acomplishes to land on the floor on her flank "Ow"
<BonBon> I feel your pain Leika
<Leika> How does she DO that?
<MeteorVenture> whatever that means
<SleepWeaver> like this, Leika
<Dashite> No overarching story.
<Shoo_be_doo> magic, duh
<MeteorVenture> what's a meta story?
<MeteorVenture> oh ok
*SleepWeaver sits like Lyra...with the help of a few braces he built*
<BonBon> Practice. She is a lyricist after all
<Sumica> Story line that carrys over from ep to ep.
<SleepWeaver> erg...ow...like...ow...this
<Dashite> ^
<SleepWeaver> see...? ow...
<BonBon> lyricist? lyrecist?
<Sumica> each ep was a standalone.
<Leika> That looks... mighty uncomfortable... and painful... *winces*
<Nittany_Tiger_> Metastories are also known as arcs.
*SleepWeaver stops sitting that way* yeah, just a tad
<MeteorVenture> you sure? i kinda remember there being something
<SleepWeaver> anyhoo, goodnight for realz
<Leika> Night night! Again!
<BonBon> You should see lyra dance. How she moves like that I'll never know
<BonBon> It's kind of alluring though
<Leika> I told you, she's a human in disguise! They want to take over Equestria and force us into slave labor! D:
<Tranquility> When was this made?
<Sumica> Kinda Nittany_Tiger_ but that is more for when the story cant be told in one ep. meta is more for when you still have the stand alone story then the bigger story.
<Fluttershy> Mmm hey guys I'm going to get off and go to bed too
<Sumica> 4 years or so ago.
<MeteorVenture> if you're sure about that then well ok
<BonBon> Yknow what? I'm just going to say she's a pony for now and go with that
<MeteorVenture> not that it needed it really
<Nittany_Tiger_> K
<Dashite> Season 1 debuted in 2007
<BonBon> But... maybe a check when she's asleep wouldnt hurt..
*SleepWeaver pokes his head back in one last time*
<TrollightSparkle> Night Fluttersby
<Leika> You're the one livint with the enemy... >.>
<Sumica> Night Fluttershy, hope we get to hear you again tomorrow =p
<TrollightSparkle> Fluttershy*
<SleepWeaver> stop filling the poor mare's head with lies, Leika
<Thunder_Dash> Bye, Fluttershy
<SleepWeaver> or should I say, LIEka
*SleepWeaver leaves*
<Leika> They are NOT lies!
<Fluttershy> Well of course. ^^ I'll be here for more streamception tomorrow for sure~
<Shoo_be_doo> lie
<Sumica> ^_^
<Leika> Sure I read a lot books on conspiracies, but that doesn't mean I'm making this up!
*BonBon cringes at that name
<Leika> I'M NOT CRAZY! D:<
<Fluttershy> Sooo... night!
<TrollightSparkle> Good night!
<SleepWeaver> that's what all the crazy one's say
<Shoo_be_doo> pff sure
<BonBon> We're not saying you are Leika. Don't throw a fuss
<Leika> Cog's saying I'm crazy! ;_;
<Solo> I envy little kids who get to see MLP growing up.
*MrMooMoo lurking
<Solo> Talk about a nice memory to carry.
<Lordlyhour> Well, The power is back on
<AlphaOmega> no its not
*BonBon hums the MLP G1 theme
<Leika> I wish Lyra was here, then I'd prove to all of you that she is a spy! >.>
<KnightLight> Hey, SleepWeaver
*KnightLight nudges SleepWeaver toward the PMs
<SleepWeaver> ?
<KnightLight> mind if I send you something to read for me?
<SleepWeaver> sure, go ahead
<SleepWeaver> PM it or Gchat it
<SleepWeaver> either way
<Kencolt> Just saying hello. Oh, and is there anypony who needs to be bitten? I hope not...
<MeteorVenture> monk would have shot right out the door when she started sneezing
<Spose> Test your might...
<MeteorVenture> monk OCD's better
<TrollightSparkle> Bitten? Like.. vampire stuff sorta deal?
<Thunder_Dash> Bitten? I... don't follow
<Sumica> Hand wave the accent
<Kencolt> Um.. No. I'm not... strictly speaking, a pony...
<sotha> Oh Kencolt? Are you the one I think you are?
<sotha> the wolf raised by ponies?
<sotha> Hello!
<Kencolt> I'm a wold who was raised by ponies, and mostly think like a pony, But sometimes, well...
<Kencolt> I mean wolf.
<Sumica> A pony is wolfs clothing?
<Kencolt> yeah..that's me.
<Leika> That's an odd thing to say when you first enter a room o.o
<BonBon> It's getting late. I think I should be going home now. I just hope the spy- i mean LYRA isnt still upset with me
*BonBon shakes her head
<Kencolt> No, a wolf in ponys clothing. Except I rarely wear clothes.
<BonBon> anyways, goodbye everypony
<Sumica> Who dose thees days.
<JackiePie> I'm watching this guy on Dark Matters, I'm guessing it's his character he's playing, he always looks like he's got a herpderp face on.
<Azure_CoalSpark> by bonbon, and hello everypony *waves*
<Spose> It is strange first words, but it works in any situation.
<Spose> Bye bon!
<JackiePie> It's funny.
<JackiePie> Kind of like a confused dog.
<Bobbin> Hello, ponies.
<Bobbin> How is everypony tonight?
<MeteorVenture> fluttershy is a pony in pegasus' clothing
<Thunder_Dash> I still don't really follow on "needs to be bitten"
<Azure_CoalSpark> good and urself?
<Kencolt> I do wear a scarf a LOT... That unicorn insists... she says it gives contrast to my haunch...
<sotha> But you said you mostly think like a pony. That would make you a pony in wolf's skin. . .
<Spose> I'm in a Mortal Kombat and Pony mood. An odd mix.
<Bobbin> Working, but well otherwise.
<TrollightSparkle> We're all animals. /discussion
<Kencolt> Sometimes... some ponies get, well, a little out of hand? Or Stupid? Or even... bad?
<Azure_CoalSpark> pinkie pie could totally whoop shao khan
<Kencolt> And well, a little nip once in a while, makes them listen up. Just a little.
<Nittany_Tiger_> :p
<Thunder_Dash> Oh, okay. No, I don't know anypony like that myself
<Nittany_Tiger_> Off to bed. Night.
<Bobbin> I could see it
<Bobbin> Or laugh him into submission.
<JackiePie> Bobbin I was just talking about how this guy on TV is playing a character who seems to constantly look like he's herpin' and derpin'
<Thunder_Dash> See ya, Nittany
<Sumica> Night Nittany_Tiger_
<MeteorVenture> should have called L to deal with this guy
<TrollightSparkle> Night Nittany
<Bobbin> Eh?
*Kencolt growls. "Especially that Trixie."
<JackiePie> He just has this look on his face like he's going "Duurr?"
<JackiePie> it
<JackiePie> It's funny
<Bobbin> lol
<Leika> I wonder what moves Fluttershy will have in that Mane 6 Fighting game they are developing o.o
<Bobbin> ...
<Bobbin> guilt-trip attack?
<LunaOnTheMoon> she will be able to do the stare
<LunaOnTheMoon> and that's it
<LunaOnTheMoon> but it will be instant win
<Filter|Writing> The one-hit-KO-stare
<Bobbin> she'll tell you you're not being nice while looking all pathetic and cute
<Azure_CoalSpark> she will cute everyone to death, the enemy will feel so bad about hurting something so adorable they will commit suicide
<Bobbin> heh
<JackiePie> Like the giant hamster from Invader Zim!
<Lordlyhour> FLuttershy?
<Spose> The Stare will be level 3 finisher.
<Kencolt> She's nothing like... like... Oh, well... not that's there's any hope there.
<Bobbin> lol
<sotha> Good night.
<Spose> You win if they are facing you.
<sotha> Nittany_Tiger
<Lordlyhour> She's going to be one of those characters that has Freinds pop out of no-where and pown the enemy
<Bobbin> So..AJ would be the biggest threat?
<Leika> Angel would probably end up fighting in her stead >.>
<Filter|Writing> ^
<Lordlyhour> Suer one: Angel with a machete
<Spose> She'll probably summon animals to do her attacks.
<Lordlyhour> super 2
<Lordlyhour> The stare
<Spose> I imagine her ranged attack will be Angel throwing a carrot.
<JackiePie> No, Fluttershy wouldn't have her animals fight for her.
<JackiePie> That sounds like something a bad guy would do
<Lordlyhour> Not really
<Leika> They would actually come in her defense I believe
<Filter|Writing> ranged would probably be something involving birds or butterflies
<Lordlyhour> Fluttershy'd just be sitting there
<Azure_CoalSpark> she would be to worried about her animal friends getting hurt
<Lordlyhour> RUnning away
<JackiePie> Well that's my opinon, take it or leave it.
<Lordlyhour> and the animals would attack for her anyway
<JackiePie> Azure that's what I was thinking.
<Bobbin> I just can't see her actually hurting anything.
<Lordlyhour> she'd all be NO! don't do it
<Bobbin> A stern telling-off, sure.
<Lordlyhour> and they'd just ognpore her
<Filter|Writing> Dragon comes down from the mountain
<Lordlyhour> and destroy the enemy
<JackiePie> Eh, drama..
<Leika> Rarity is going to bitchslap the heck out of anypony XD
<Filter|Writing> lol
<Lordlyhour> eeyup
<Azure_CoalSpark> death choke by scarf?
<Lordlyhour> I wonder who the other characters are going to be
<Filter|Writing> My money says there's a Spike move in there
<Lordlyhour> heh
<Spose> I can't wait to see Luna and Trixie.
<Bobbin> lol
<Spose> Both of whom better be in it.
<Spose> *cough*
<JackiePie> Lovesick Spike attack
<Azure_CoalSpark> I could see Rarity using Spike as a weapon
<Lordlyhour> Actually, I think we can dafely rule out a Spike character, simply because of rrity
<Filter|Writing> yerp
<Bobbin> Heh...I think I'm required to be a Luna fan, honestly.
<Kencolt> Anyhow, I know I don't fit in at times, but I guess I'm not really meant to...
<Spose> Though if Luna is in it, does that mean Celestia could be? O.o
<JackiePie> "I'll defend you Rarity!" *Spike tries to attack, with hearts blinding his eyes*
<Lordlyhour> unless they were going to guve him a special "Fighting rarity" moveset
<Spose> That'd be an...interesting fighter.
<TrollightSparkle> iknowdatfeelbro
<Filter|Writing> Trollestia, finisher
<Leika> Sends you to the moon!
<Spose> If Spike is a fighter, or appears at all, he needs to appear at some point in his super-macho-hero form.
<Lordlyhour> do you like mmmmbananas?
<Spose> LOL leika
<JackiePie> Oh no, herpderp man became a hero!
<Filter|Writing> damn u lordly! i was gonna say that
<Kencolt> Your name is...
*Lordlyhour trollfaces
<Bobbin> lol
<Bobbin> Macho-Spike would be great.
*Filter|Writing raeg
<Kencolt> So...
<Kencolt> SO...
<TrollightSparkle> My name is..?
<Bobbin> A finisher for Rarity.
<Kencolt> SO CLOSE TO...
<Pants_Dancer> KIIIIIIIIIIISS?
<TrollightSparkle> Don't do it bro
<Kencolt> ARRRGH!
<Filter|Writing> I could see something like encasing the oponnent in a giant gem
<Bobbin> Heh....He shows up to defend Rarity while riding Twilight.
<Pants_Dancer> Hey, guys. Can I have your opinion on this? SideStroke, this kind of applies directlyh to you, and you, too, Lordlyhour
<Lordlyhour> I hopr some of the characters have a custom win quote when beating certain other characters
*TrollightSparkle shoots Kencolt with a tranquilizer gun.
<MeteorVenture> that dude who runs around in his underwear kinda reminds me of Huang from darker than black
<Dumori> Hey all
<Thunder_Dash> I know what it's like to not fit in too, so... yeah...
<Lordlyhour> Nyess pants?
<TrollightSparkle> Hello dumori
<Pants_Dancer> http://oi52.tinypic.com/2vrzzg8.jpg
<Pants_Dancer> This is trolling a really bad player in a mafia game
<Dumori> I hate being ill.
<Sumica> Funny you bring that show up MeteorVenture, was think that one next.
<Pants_Dancer> Good? Bad?
<Lordlyhour> Rarity'd just summon a horde of admiters who'd trampole the enemy
<Sumica> Hi Dumori
*mook wants tagging or strikers like in kof
<JackiePie> no comment
<Kencolt> I.. I can't help it... I... I... it's totally improper... not proper to the Pack... not proper to... to..
<Thunder_Dash> Hey, Dumori
<Pants_Dancer> Jackie Pie: I editted the text...
*JackiePie keeps nommin' her rabbit food
<Lordlyhour> wut?
*Kencolt hides his head beneath his paws.
<Leika> Rarity's finisher is dressing the opponent in frilly dresses! It's SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Applejack!
<JackiePie> carrots
<Filter|Writing> oooooooooh
<Lordlyhour> Actually, that'd be fun
<Bobbin> lol
<Bobbin> Special Move: Makeover.
<Pants_Dancer> Lordlyhour: by "admirers" do you mean those ponies that pulled the apple-carridge?
<Lordlyhour> Every character gets their own custom clothing too
<Lordlyhour> Yup
<JackiePie> I had a strange craving for veggies
<Spose> You think Pinkie Pie will have a "get pyscho" finisher?
<Azure_CoalSpark> Would Pinkie Pie have cake bombs? thatd be cool
<Sidestroke> Heh
<MeteorVenture> i just got done watching season 1 of darker than black recently so that might have something to do with it lol
<Pants_Dancer> You guys, that's way to complicated.
<Lordlyhour> Fluutershy will have the get pscho
<Sidestroke> It's... bad. But that's how it's supposed to be to make it good
<Sidestroke> xP
<Bobbin> jam a cupcake down your throat
<Lordlyhour> I don't see why Schitzo!pinkie would make an appearance
<Pants_Dancer> Sidestroke: Do you think my text is okay?
<Lordlyhour> She's doesn't really do much
*Thunder_Dash hugs Kencolt in an attempt to comfort him
<Spose> The mane 6 at least have multiple skins.
<Kencolt> It's not proper for a pony, much less the last wold in Equestria...
<Azure_CoalSpark> "Cross my heart and hope to fly Stick a cupcake in YOUR EYE"
<Pants_Dancer> I'm looking for really infuriating text.
<Spose> Not sure if the rest of the chars do.
<Kencolt> I...
<Kencolt> I,...
<JackiePie> Someone should have sea pony coming from eye as a death move
<Kencolt> If I tell you.. will you promise not to tell her?
<Lordlyhour> The alternate skins are just for multiplayer fights though
<TrollightSparkle> ?
<Pants_Dancer> woo?
<Pants_Dancer> Doesn't matter
<JackiePie> As is tradition
<Lordlyhour> Because it'd get confusing if everycharacter was the same colorwhe you werefighting
<Pants_Dancer> once the game comes out
<Pants_Dancer> I rip the sprites and make MUGEN fighters.
*Kencolt takes a deep breath. A VERY deep breath.
<Leika> It's likely that Pinkamena will be a diferent skin for Pinkie Pie
<Filter|Writing> lol
<TrollightSparkle> If you don't want to talk about it..
<Pants_Dancer> Leika: that would require different sprites entierly
<Pants_Dancer> not just a different skin.
<Kencolt> I ... I have a little crush on Twilight Sparkle.
<Lordlyhour> That would require an entirely new SPriteset though
<Pants_Dancer> It'd be making a different character.
<mook> nmm as gouki.. hm...
<Lordlyhour> Rather than just a recolor
*Pants_Dancer brohoofs Lordlyhour
<Pants_Dancer> Called it, bro, but yeah.
*Lordlyhour Broohoofs back
<Sumica> Perhaps "tiger and bunny" next.
<Lordlyhour> When I'm typing I don't actually look at the screen
<Lordlyhour> 'So, if someone pre-empts me, I'm still being original :D
<Filter|Writing> I do that somethimes
<Pants_Dancer> WHAT
<Sethisto> WHAT
<Pants_Dancer> BACON_CAT, NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.
<Sethisto> is stuff breaking here?
<Spose> On the topic of Fluttershy, and because I'm watching Mortal Kombat vids: http://s608.photobucket.com/albums/tt170/Paradox043/?action=view&current=1312660026omny87_flutterscorpio.jpg
<MrMooMoo> Hello Sethisto
<Sheep> hello everypony
<Kencolt> And that would never work! Because I'm the Wolf, and she's NOT a wolf, and I have no idea how that could work, and she's--
<JackiePie> daww
<Solo> Whoa. hey there, Sethisto.
<Sethisto> elo
<Spose> Hey Seth.
<MeteorVenture> that's the first time i laughed while watching this i think o.o
<Leika> Hey Seth!
<MrMooMoo> I came at the right time.
<Bobbin> lol
<Dashite> Heh.
<Lordlyhour> My god
<Lordlyhour> Its a seth
<HotCocoa> OH SHI--
<Filter|Writing> hah
<Azure_CoalSpark> OMG YE
<Azure_CoalSpark> s
<Dashite> Only third episode.
<HotCocoa> We're all screwed now.
<Pants_Dancer> MrMooMoo! I looked, Apparently Barley Stalk already has a fanon name.
<MrMooMoo> Why am i always so lucky?
<Solo> Poor Sethisto. A celebrity in his own IRC chat.
*Lordlyhour hurls a pokeball at Seth
<Kencolt> She's... an Element. WAY out of my league.
<Sethisto> uh oh!
<Filter|Writing> laughhhh
<MrMooMoo> First sibsy now a seth!
*HotCocoa retreats to his bucket.
<Pants_Dancer> Gotta use dem superballs.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Whut? When did Seth get here?
<Sethisto> so i take it nothing is breaking here?
<Lordlyhour> I must have it!
<RainbowDash> Hiya Seth
<Filter|Writing> brb
<Lordlyhour> Nuup
<Sketchy_Sounds> Everything is fine far as I can see dude
<Lordlyhour> Nothing more than usual
<MeteorVenture> this show makes a ton of jokes.. but mostly casual ones that aren't exactly for lols
<RainbowDash> Not really, what do you mean broke?
<HotCocoa> Sethisto, where were you last Thursday night?
<Pants_Dancer> Um... What's supposed to be broken, Sethisto?
<Sumica> Woops
<Kencolt> I honestly can't imagine a sillier crush.
<MrMooMoo> So that means slow news day?
<HeatWave> It would appear so, if he's come to mingle with the commoners.
<Colgate> as far as I know, everything is fine
*HotCocoa looks for a soap box.
<Pantsshy> (Colgate doesn't know too much)
<Colgate> wait, why don't I know too much? :O
<RainbowDash> So what seems to be a problem Seth?
<Leika> I think we broke Bon bon Seth
<Pantsshy> *officer
<MrMooMoo> We are.
<Sethisto> AH
<Sethisto> Alrighty
<Colgate> irc seems fine. /shrug
<Sethisto> someone told me geekshed was banning pony stuff
<Pantsshy> Oh, yeah
<Dashite> Zap. :D
<Pantsshy> I heard that too
<SleepWeaver> ?
<Hayfever> we have geekshed admins hanging out here
<RainbowDash> I haven't heard about that hand on
<Hayfever> i do not think they would ban us
<Colgate> sounds like a big rumor
<SleepWeaver> us mods didn't hear that...
<Sethisto> alrighty
*Kencolt sighs. "But,, i guess crushes are like that... silly?"
<Sethisto> i wont worry about it then!
<Pantsshy> Somepony came in here-- It was, like, Oh!
<RainbowDash> Drat, that admin isn't on right now
<Sethisto> I figured it was bleh anyway
<Lysiria> Stab whoever you heard it from
<HotCocoa> No, the guys over in #brony got a little sore about something and moved.
<Pantsshy> SunnySunshine or something.
<Lordlyhour> Ah
<HotCocoa> Nobody's banning anything.
<HotCocoa> Other than the occasional parasprite sent to the !Moon.
<MrMooMoo> Keep calm and ponies.
<Pantsshy> And me
<JackiePie> Move where, the moon?
<RainbowDash> I could ask them about that Seth if you'd like?
<Pantsshy> Nopony's banning anything except parasprites and me.
<Pantsshy> x____x
<Sethisto> nah its alright
<Lordlyhour> Of the EqDaily Blogdaddies (and phoe), who's voice is your favourite?
<Sethisto> if anything happens though let me know and i'll move it over
*HotCocoa wonders if DerpyBot can !moon Seth...
<Sethisto> seems fine right now!
<Lordlyhour> Mines.... Probably... Cereal
<Pantsshy> Eeeyup!
<Colgate> HotCocoa: definitely not
<Pantsshy> Thanks, Sethisto!
<HotCocoa> Yeah I know.
<Solo> Sethisto: How long are you going to be hanging around the IRC?
<Lordlyhour> Then a tossup between seth an phoe
<HotCocoa> Nobody can kick a channel owner.
<Colgate> Seth = founder, Derpy = op
<Sheep> HotCocoa try it.
<RainbowDash> I haven't seen any problems with Geekshed since the netsplits have stablized.
<HotCocoa> Sheep: no, I already trolled myself.
<Pantsshy> Wait, they stablized?
<SleepWeaver> Seth sounds like Scott Pilgrim, so I'd have to say Seth has the best voice of the 3 blog ponies
<Pantsshy> Like, for long-term?
<Colgate> I haven't noticed a netsplit for a while
<Lordlyhour> yeah, that is true
<sotha> Probably.
<Sumica> Better to aim high and miss then to aim low and hit Kencolt
<Pantsshy> See, when Sethisto types into IRC, I don't acutally hear his voice, so I don't know what he sounds like.
<RainbowDash> That's what I'm refering to, I heard they said they fixed the Boomer server.
<HotCocoa> Sheep Sethisto http://www.bronydb.com/p.php?qid=11
<Sethisto> pfff
*HotCocoa = AtomicBrony
<Lordlyhour> Seth, your voice got promoted to favourite blogpony, tying with cereal
<Sethisto> i never did like my voice
<MrMooMoo> !link seth
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/27484?search=Seth
<Sockwear_Moon> :O
*Octavia = made of pony.
<Bobbin> I think most people dislike their own voices.
*Rarity = made of marshmallow.
*Octavia omnoms
<Lordlyhour> Gotta wonder
<Sockwear_Moon> I've sounded like I was 30 since age 10.
*MrMooMoo is not for eating.
<Pantsshy> Cereal was inside Retsamoreh?
*Rarity drinks MrMooMoo then.
<Azure_CoalSpark> 0.o
<Sheep> i sound really... femenine when I talk normally... im a guy... 19 years old..
<Lordlyhour> I've sounded like i was fourteen since age 5
<Bobbin> Sheep, I used to have that problem. It'll settle in.
<Pantsshy> Rarity is like a marshmallow wrapped in velvet.
<Pantsshy> Pinkie Pie is like velvet wrapped in a marshmallow
<JackiePie> LoL, you must've sounded like Stewie from Family Guy Lordly
<Sheep> v___v thanks Bobbin
<Pantsshy> -____-
<Sockwear_Moon> I sound like that big black dude from Daredevil.
<Rarity> ...at least you didn't say "warpped in socks."
<Rarity> *wrapped
<Kencolt> Maybe...
<Rarity> Sockwear_Moon: Michael Clarke Duncan
<Leika> SOCKS?!
*Lordlyhour wraps rarity in socks
<Sockwear_Moon> Yeah, that guy.
<Pantsshy> "warpped in socks"
*Rarity NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOs.
<MrMooMoo> You would tasted good melted.
<RainbowDash> Seth, so what did you think of Sibsy dropping in to chat in here?
*Pantsshy wraps Rarity in a fashionable shrug
<JackiePie> I thought it was awesome
*Rarity thinks we scared off Sethisto.
<Pantsshy> BTW, who is Sibsy?
<Sethisto> its pretty awesome!
<Sethisto> sorry multitasking
<Rarity> Pantsshy: sibsy.deviantart.com
<JackiePie> a artist for MLP FiM
<Pantsshy> Ah.
<Solo> Pantsshy: Lead storyboard artist on MLP.
<Pantsshy> AH.
<Lordlyhour> WE are so terrifying
<Octavia> i can ask her to come back one day and do a formal QA perhaps
<Kencolt> I guess it's like, well, the ponies are my pack. I protect my pack. Mostly by biting, but well, ponies aren't very good at biting...
*Sockwear_Moon tries to will time to go faster so it can be September 17th
<Rarity> Octavia: +m chat even :P
<Lordlyhour> we scare away the Brony who made me a Brony, albeit indirectly?
<RainbowDash> Understandable Seth, running EquestriaDaily must be really hard to do.
<Lordlyhour> Nerd points? Through the roof
<JackiePie> Yeah, she showed up and everyone was, "OMG SIBSY!"
<Solo> Octavia: Encourage her to just hang with us more often. It was nice that she just came to chat.... I think we shouldn't have made SUCH a big deal of it.
<Spose> So, I know Season 2 starts in 10 days. What time does it air, though?
<Rarity> I saw her first!
<Zorotokon> Oh I forgot to mention.
<MrMooMoo> She never answered my question about cows is season 2...
<Rarity> And I was debating saying anything until she said it was okay.
<Sumica> Oh they bite just fine, just why bite when you have better tools.
<Zorotokon> Today is Rainbow dash day now.
<JackiePie> It's 1 am, I better sleeps nao.
<Octavia> Solo, the mods were going out of their minds trying to keep the piece. we can only take so much :)
<JackiePie> Night
<Pantsshy> Octavia: I'm biased against formal Q & As, Phoe never answered any of mine and I was WELL before the cutoff.
<Rarity> *peace
<Rarity> ;P
<Lordlyhour> Thats because she didn;t like you
<Zorotokon> Also: You people ttly missed it.
<RainbowDash> Yeah, it was pretty hard to mod when Sibsy came in.
<Solo> Octavia: Yeah, I know. Still... if she came around more often, maybe people would stop going hyper about it.
<Lordlyhour> or maybe your questions just sucked
<Zorotokon> I was DJing today at my college radio station and the dj after me never showed.
<Sidestroke> Agreed with RainbowDash
<Kencolt> And her... I'd bite CELESTIA for her. Um. If I had to, Which I won't want to do. Because she's Celestia... and anyhow I kind of more deal with Luna-- I mean, she's the moon?\
<Sheep> its so rapid talky, I'm going to retreat to my cave until morning, when its less quick.
<Sheep> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Zorotokon> So I played MLP remixes for an hour.
<Sidestroke> Thanks for the awesome news site ^/^
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Sheep in a tight embrace
<Sockwear_Moon> I don't even know who this 'Sibsy' is, so I'm sure I wouldn't have made a big deal. :P
<Sheep> !lullaby
*DerpyBot carries Sheep off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks Sheep in and hums a lullaby
<Kencolt> And wolves and the Moon...
<Sheep> night all
<HotCocoa> G'night Sheep
<Zorotokon> Night sheep.
<MrMooMoo> Count cows!
<Sheep> *night everypony
<Bobbin> nn sheep
<Lordlyhour> So, question
<RainbowDash> Sibsy is a storyboard artist for MLP FIM
<Azure_CoalSpark> night sheep
<Sheep> oh, i plan to moomoo
<Octavia> Solo, she is incredibly busy most of the time
<derpderp> i am derp
<Solo> Octavia: I figured.
<Lordlyhour> How did you guys know it was actually sibsy
<Octavia> Fireant~~~
<Lordlyhour> rather than an imposter?
<Leika> Well, time for this silly pony to sleep, nighty night folks!
<Sockwear_Moon> Ah, gotcha. So s/he came in and everyone went nuts.
<derpderp> I am derpy hooves. dick goes where
<HotCocoa> Lordlyhour: she verified it.
<RainbowDash> We have our information on that
<Bobbin> nn Leika
<Lordlyhour> How?
*Octavia knows sibsy personally :p
<RainbowDash> ^
<HotCocoa> ^
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Saigonshy (http://tinyurl.com/3erzmj4)
*Lordlyhour is so jealous of Octavia
<HotCocoa> Sorry, I meant Octavia verified it :P
<Pantsshy> I had GOOD questions!
<Pantsshy> None of this, "Y R U SO GAY" stuff.
<Pantsshy> or, "WHO IS BEST PONI" for the 100th time
<Lordlyhour> WHY MUST YOU BE O MUCH BETTER THAN ME?!
<Kencolt> I like mon.
<Solo> Don't be jealous of Octavia. You get to know Octavia personally, and that's just as good :P
<RainbowDash> Lets not start cap spam
<Kencolt> Moon.
<Octavia> yeah, caps >.<
<Kencolt> I want to be a moon. Sometimes.
<Fireant> Octavia~~~
<Solo> Sethisto: Jeez, dude. You never stop working :P
<HotCocoa> YEAH, CA*shot*
<Sethisto> Alright, i gotta head out! see yahs!
*Filter|Writing is attracted back to the chat by the idea of caps
<HotCocoa> G'night Seth
<Spose> I recently discovered that Octavia is awesome.
<derpderp> KENCOLT YOU ARE SEXY. FUCK MY ANUS
<HotCocoa> Hey Fireant
<derpderp> FUCK TWILIGHT SPARKLE SHES A NIGGER
<Filter|Writing> Just recently? bit late on that one
*Azure_CoalSpark yawns and nibbles a sammich
*Fireant drink HotCocoa
<MrMooMoo> Well that was fun.
<TrollightSparkle> May I say what the hell is this?
<Kencolt> Um.. am I hgearing a crazy pony?
<Spose> I've been easing myself in to the fandom.
<TrollightSparkle> Most likely.
<Octavia> i bit my tongue and now it hurts and i keep raking it over the back of my teeth and it is driving me insane
<HotCocoa> Seth shows up... "Oh crap what did I get myself into GOOD NIGHT" ...and leaves.
<Octavia> coolstorybro
<Lordlyhour> Yeah. Biting your tounge sucks'
<TrollightSparkle> Now who has op?
<derpderp> DICK GOES IN EAR IF THE NARWHAL BACON IS IN SUNDAY
<HotCocoa> Octavia: I do that all the damn time.
<Sockwear_Moon> I bit my tongue once. It hurt.
<Solo> Octavia: there's a way to fix tongue injuries. Let me think.
<MrMooMoo> I do it allot with braces.
<Filter|Writing> Only once? Damn your good
<Kencolt> Is.. it it talking about... naughty stuff?
<MeteorVenture> but who is phone?
<Lordlyhour> Cut your tounge off
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah huh.
<Lordlyhour> then it'll never happen again
<Sockwear_Moon> But I believe the mouth has the fastest ability to heal.
<Solo> Octavia: I think with tongue injuries, you're supposed to keep it cold for a while. It doesn't heal quickly normally because it bleeds too much.
<Lordlyhour> Dear god
<MrMooMoo> Tip of my tongue is numb forever.
<Sockwear_Moon> Or something.
<Solo> Sockwear: Eyes.
<Lordlyhour> the image for saigonshy
<TrollightSparkle> More random, nonsensical, vulgar gibberish than anything, actually.
<Kencolt> It is... insane?
<Lordlyhour> is creepy as heck
<Dashite> Da na na nana...
<derpderp> cant touch this
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> did you know you can't say toy boat fast three times?
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> in a row*
*TrollightSparkle touches derpderp.
<Kencolt> Don't WANT to.
<TrollightSparkle> What was that?
<Lordlyhour> ?
<Sockwear_Moon> .. But I just did it.
<Bobbin> ..
<AlwaysSunnyInFilly> The more you know
<Lordlyhour> Yes. Yes I can
<Bobbin> indeed
<Spose> I remember when I had some teeth pulled and I got morphine shot in my gums. A few hours later my lip was sore because I was chewing on it and didn't notice.
<Dashite> Nah, that's Da na nana.
<derpderp> you touched me in my vagina
<derpderp> we are mated for life
<Sockwear_Moon> I bit the inside of my cheek once. It hurt.
<sotha> http://millionthreason.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/phonesrang.jpg?w=215
<Spose> Also, I was dissapointed that there is no "Octavia" category search. :(
<TrollightSparkle> What the hell.
<Kencolt> I..may have been raised by ponies, but I kow of Wolven dignity. That that does NOT qualify.
<derpderp> PFF THIS SHOW IS FOR LITTLE GIRLS. STUPID BROWNIES
<Pantsshy> I was dissapointed that I never saw DJ PON3 in the show
<MeteorVenture> gurren lagann in the middle
<Pantsshy> Even though that's where she comes from.
<TrollightSparkle> Who else saw this parasprite coming?
<Kencolt> Ah. I think I see. We have a troll. Shall I bite it? Should I bite it?
<derpderp> parasprite? i shove them up my anal cavity
<Azure_CoalSpark> Vinyl Scratch needs to make some more appearances, she was cool
<Zorotokon> I bit the inside of my cheek before.
<Bobbin> Agreed.
<Sockwear_Moon> Probably too busy harassing Octavia.
<Pantsshy> Ooh, I'd like to see Vinyl take up the challenge against Trixie.
<MrCreepy> gurren lagann is the most best awesomeist
<MrMooMoo> I love her mane.
<derpderp> Got herpes? We do too!
<Pantsshy> Octavia and Lyra...?
<Sockwear_Moon> You know how those two are.
<MeteorVenture> what is this new form of CG mecha?
<derpderp> who is allowing the advertising on this site
<Zorotokon> It hurt more then the time I broke my entire hand with a tractor.
<Bobbin> Though, I there there are a few who could use more screen time.
<Pantsshy> @Zorotokon: IKR!?
<Sockwear_Moon> I guess she harasses Lyra sometimes.
<Kencolt> Who is allowing YOU on this site?
<Azure_CoalSpark> brb
<Dashite> Those super heroes sold out. :(
<Pantsshy> Big Macintosh, for example. He could use more screen time.
<derpderp> im waiting for season 2 of course
<Bobbin> Yeah.
<Sockwear_Moon> Lol, try eating after you bite the inside of your cheek. Its like you're eating nails.
<Bobbin> Luna, too.
<Zorotokon> Srsyl Pantsshy, it just wouldn't stop hurting.
<Azure_CoalSpark> YES!! We need more Luna, Join the darkside! support princess luna <3
<PinkyPyro> lol like the nintendo game
<MrMooMoo> We'll get some cool new characters too hopefully.
<Zorotokon> It was like I tore the entire inside cheek off.
<Zorotokon> but it was just a nip!
<Kencolt> Out of curiosity- whgat theb hay is this?
<derpderp> прывітанне
<Pantsshy> I figure if I fill the cavity with sugar, it'll be solid again and stop hurting
<Bobbin> Azure, I'm a night-shift worker. I have to like Luna :p
<derpderp> тое, што вы кажаце
<Sockwear_Moon> I naturally gravitate toward being a night owl for whatever reason.
<Pantsshy> Azure: WRONG! No matter how they do Luna, fans will fucking RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE.
<derpderp> казаць, як спыніць поні вы Arnt поні. дурное асабістага
<PinkyPyro> tiger and bunny, i heard of it but never saw it
<Bobbin> Bah, someone will rage about anything.
<Spose> They should be around more, but I don't think they should be part of the plot.
<derpderp> усе вы GAY
<derpderp> dasfagash
<derpderp> gasogaigas
<derpderp> safoiaasfasfaf
<derpderp> пеніс
<MeteorVenture> BISON!
<derpderp> ён
<TrollightSparkle> Probably don't want to know what you're saying.
<Spose> Goes for octavia/lyra/scratch, not Luna. Need moar luna.
<derpderp> BISON з'яўляецца гаспадаром
<Bobbin> That would work.
<MrMooMoo> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<Sockwear_Moon> Well see. I've got this voice for Luna in my head. That's the only thing I'm scared they'll ruin.
<Pantsshy> Luna SHOULD have been in Call of the Cutie
<derpderp> гэта залежыць
<derpderp> Вы bronie?
<Azure_CoalSpark> I was nocturnal before I started working at night, iv always loved luna :p also I LOVE HER VOICE in those like 2 seconds she spoke i d'aaawed so hard
<derpderp> калі так, то смактаць
<Bobbin> :p
<Lordlyhour> They're going to kill a lot of fanon
<TuxRug> Has Spike ever sung, or has it always just been ponies?
<Octavia> tabitha is a pro
<TrollightSparkle> ON THE MOOOOOOOONONNNNNNNNNNN
<Lordlyhour> This will cause Nerdrage
<Octavia> 13lol
<Pantsshy> Luna should have been in Call of the Cutie at the end.
<Sockwear_Moon> I belive Spike sang before.
<Bobbin> Everything causes nerdrage.
<TrollightSparkle> BEEEEYEEEEETCHHHH
<PinkyPyro> mmmmmbananas
<Sumica> Thank you Octavia
<Kencolt> Ohhhh--- kayyy. Random Russian for no apparent reason.
<Octavia> 13He'll be back I'm sure. lol
<Pantsshy> "Ponies might like you for stuff you don't think the will"
<Sockwear_Moon> I remember there being some shots of him with a microphone.
<Azure_CoalSpark> nerdrage causes nerdrage
<TrollightSparkle> So, so you're a mmmbitch that likes mmmbananas?!
<Pantsshy> *Celestia looks at her CMark*
<Pantsshy> WTF?
<TrollightSparkle> He probably will be Octavia, but thanks for that, he was getting quite annoying :
<TrollightSparkle> :/
<TuxRug> Sockwear_Moon: that's from him announcing the fashion show, I believe
<Pantsshy> Celestia should have been looking at Luna, nestled under her wing, reading the letter aloud to her.
<MrCreepy> 11:09 PM - Mr. Creepy: they say you will be back. will you? 11:10 PM - Jim Carrey: nah
<Spose> Yeah. He announced during the Fall Winter Friends.
<Sockwear_Moon> Was it? Drat.
<Spose> Er,
<Spose> Fall something friends.
<MrCreepy> No need to worry, he is done!
<Kencolt> He comes back-- I just might bite.
<MeteorVenture> this looks like.. there's super heroes and since they always win the public just places bets on who will take down the bad guy
<MrMooMoo> Weather
<Spose> He and Pinkie did announcing. And I think he did it briefly during Rarity's show.
<TrollightSparkle> So this was never answered.. what is this show?
<TuxRug> Fall weather friends and Suited for success
<Sockwear_Moon> I guess he never sang.
<Pantsshy> WHOA!
<Xiagu|PastSins> Spose, yes, what TuxRug
<Sumica> Tiger and bunny
<Sockwear_Moon> Probably too girly.
*Xiagu|PastSins is not useful anymore
<Pantsshy> Spike DOES need to sing, though
<Pantsshy> Low, mellow voice.
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, thanks
<Pantsshy> OMFG.
<Xiagu|PastSins> everypony is providing episode refs before me
<MrMooMoo> For rarity
*Pantsshy fanfilly squee.
<MeteorVenture> only 100X? he's already friggin strong
<Spose> Flutterguy needs to sing more. :D
<Pantsshy> Xiagu: you've been replaced by a hjorde of noobs.
<Kencolt> Hunh.. I could do that.
<PinkyPyro> reminds me of moldiver
<Xiagu|PastSins> Pantsshy, :(
*MrMooMoo ain't a noob...
<Pantsshy> MrMooMoo: Nooo! no, just like, a line or two.
<Sockwear_Moon> Luna must sing in S2.
<Xiagu|PastSins> Pantsshy, at least it's a hjord. Is that something like a fjord?
*HotCocoa goes to bed
<Sockwear_Moon> It is required.
<Bobbin> Best song so far was Flutterguy's song.
<HotCocoa> G"night
<Sockwear_Moon> And it must be about socks.
<Pantsshy> Ponies: "Sing, sing, sing, sing"
<TuxRug> She's an evil enchantress, and she does evil dances / and if you look into her eyes, she will put you in trances / and what will she do? / she'll mix up an evil brew / and gobble you up in a big tasty stew / so, watch out!
<Sockwear_Moon> In fact, she must wear socks while singing about socks.
<Pantsshy> Spike: "OOOOOOH YEAAAAAH"
<Bobbin> lol
<Kencolt> It's certainly intersting.. wierd as all tail but interesti9ng.
<Sockwear_Moon> And she must have a sock on her horn for good measure.
<Pantsshy> Ponies: "Sing, sing, sing..."
<Azure_CoalSpark> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttnPs_3jDhI
<Pantsshy> Sockwear_Moon, EqAD please, if you're going to talk like that
<MrMooMoo> Like a chorus
<Sockwear_Moon> Wat?
<Pantsshy> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttnPs_3jDhI
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<Xiagu|PastSins> .....
<Azure_CoalSpark> Pantsshy :P
<Pantsshy> Azure_CoalSpark
<Sockwear_Moon> I was making a reference to a fic. :P
<Pantsshy> I THOUGHT SO. But I think the fic I'm referencing is a differnt one
<Kencolt> And.. I never knew clothing could make someone look.. LESS dressed...
<Pantsshy> Because it had something something but it didn't have luna.
<Bobbin> o0
<Sockwear_Moon> Probably. Because my reference was from one of the happy luna fics.
<MeteorVenture> ice ice navy
<PinkyPyro> lol like hour man?
<Sockwear_Moon> Where I totally stole my name from.
<TuxOtaku> actually, I'll be honest....the show could do with LESS singing
<Pantsshy> But the whole, "And then you put this on your horn" thing made me think it was a fic... that MrMooMoo read some of the other night.
<Sockwear_Moon> Shamelessly.
<PinkyPyro> but only 5 minutes
<Sumica> Consult a doctor if you become 4 hour man
<MrMooMoo> Marshmellon?
<Pantsshy> Tux_Otaku: Go watch some other show, then.
<MeteorVenture> my puns are reaching a new level.. i'm going deeper!
<Pantsshy> MrMooMoo: SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Pantsshy's shouting
<Bobbin> It is part of the show.
<Pantsshy> I'll get BANNED!
<TuxOtaku> Bobbin, yeah I know
*TuxRug 's favorite song in the show is Winter Wrap-up
<Kencolt> Gross.
<MeteorVenture> suzaku
<Spose> I like that the singing doesn't feel forced in MLP.
<TrollightSparkle> Your puns.. they burn my eyes!
<MrMooMoo> I eat marshmellows!
<Sockwear_Moon> Gah, crap, now I have winter wrap-up stuck in my head.
<Spose> Most the time they sing it goes with the flow of the episode.
<Pantsshy> Tuxrug, the singing is one of the best parts.
<TuxOtaku> I'm not big on it
<TuxOtaku> I don't hate it
<Bobbin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UqDEGoQM1w
<Azure_CoalSpark> has At The Gala memorized
<Kencolt> YOUR eyes? I'm a wolf! I have night vision! ARRGH!
<Pantsshy> Wait, TuxRug, TuxOtaku. WTF SO CONF?USED.
<Bobbin> My favorite version of Winter Wrapup, so far.
<MrMooMoo> We need more Rainbow Dash singing?
<MrMooMoo> .
<TuxRug> There's actually a few consecutive frames in WWU that make it epicly awesome
<Pantsshy> Did you know that Almost ALL of the songs blend pretty easily into each other?
<Sockwear_Moon> I was too busy being comatose during At The Gala.
<Bobbin> Has Dash had her own song yet?
<MeteorVenture> so you can see dark humor
<TuxRug> I wish Rainbow's singing sounded more like her normal voice
<MrMooMoo> Nope
<Dashite> No.
*Dashite slaps MeteorVenture around a bit with a large trout
<Pantsshy> Like in left for dead, where it was written in the same key and style and stuff...
<Dashite> That was horrible.
<TrollightSparkle> *ba dum tiss*
<TuxRug> Bobbin: she had a solo in At the Gala
<Kencolt> I can't see ANYTHING.
<Solo> huh? what?
<Bobbin> meh, close enough
*Sumica bricks MeteorVenture
<Bobbin> lol
<Solo> Dangit TuxRug.
<Pantsshy> I wish Applejack and Pinkie Pie's singing didn't sound like RD's singing.
<TuxRug> ?
<Sockwear_Moon> Because it was unexpected for them to all burst into a flash mob lke that.
<Solo> you pinged me.
<Azure_CoalSpark> yea Rainbow's singing voice is a little TOO tomboyish, the first time i heard it, it was pretty jarring
*TrollightSparkle is at the ready to deliver rimshots when needed.
<Ryex> ...
<Ryex> ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
<Kencolt> 10 million fluttershys. I don't know why, that calms me down...
<MrMooMoo> I like it.
<Ryex> I can't get it out of my head
<Sockwear_Moon> Ponies EVERYWHERE
<Pantsshy> Ryex: SWAG!
<TuxRug> Solo: I checked how long you've been in here
*Sockwear_Moon makes a sweeping motion with his hand.
<Azure_CoalSpark> ITS RAINING PONIES
<Sumica> CEO with the shows exposision.
<TrollightSparkle> I don't know how it calms YOU down, but it makes my heart explode from the cuteness overload.
<Pantsshy> Hallehlugheioewihsgljndsdf Fuck spelling fail
<Solo> TuxRug: and?
<TuxRug> Azure_CoalSpark: hallelujah?
<MeteorVenture> dang that brick thing was a great setup.. i can't make it work though
<MrMooMoo> HALLELUGH
<Sockwear_Moon> Ponies, ponies everywhere.
<Pantsshy> Yeah
<Pantsshy> THAT.
<MeteorVenture> sorry to crush your spirits sumica
<MeteorVenture> spirit*
<TrollightSparkle> *ba dum tiss*
<Kencolt> It's a wolf thing.
<MrMooMoo> P
<TuxRug> I just clicked you and clicked info.
<Pantsshy> x___x
<Solo> TuxRug: and?
<Azure_CoalSpark> I think the best song every would be if the voice actress for fluttershy actually sang this song
<Azure_CoalSpark> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxoGmVjAsmE&list=PLF308B0793AC6082B&index=16
<Ryex> [I can't get it out of my head] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qcEc1AXGUE
<Kencolt> We.. accept cute.
<PinkyPyro> I smell a Char
<Bobbin> i wouldn't mind an extended verion of fluttershy's lullaby
<Bobbin> *version
<Mason_Trowel> I prefer Sweeite Belle's lullaby, honestly. XD
<Azure_CoalSpark> yea, if flutteryshy had sang the whole song itd be cool
<Solo> TuxRug: I signed on about 7 hours ago.
<MeteorVenture> do you believe in life after love?
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: You respect aretha-franklin style signing, eh?
<Bobbin> Alright, time for my paperwork. I'll be back later, folks.
<Mason_Trowel> Very much so, Solo.
<Solo> Singing. jeez.
<TuxRug> ● [Solo] idle 00:02:17, signon: Wed Sep 07 17:05:51
<Solo> come on hands! I taught you better than that!
<Pantsshy> Ryex: that was fantastic.
<Kencolt> Life after love? Still trying to dealwith a crush...
<Solo> TuxRug: Yeah. So what's your point?
<Pantsshy> And Azure_CoalSpark: I agree.
<MeteorVenture> i smell a cher
<TuxRug> I was just curious, that's why I clicked info
<Kencolt> This just got disturbing.
<Ryex> but it sticks there, and doesn't go away!
<Solo> ....well, alright then. Heh.
<Mason_Trowel> Also, I feel that lullabies in the traditional since are rather generic, and I loved how much of a twist it was for Sweetie Belle to take the song and turn it /)^3^(\ AWESOME.
<Pantsshy> TUXRUG: WHY DID YOU BRING THIS CRAP INFORMATION UP?
<Mason_Trowel> *sense
<Mason_Trowel> Blegh
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: Sweetie Belle's Lullaby: Stay Up Late Mix. Heh. I love that name.
<Pantsshy> */)^3^(\AWESUM
<TuxRug> Pantsshy: because solo's bugging me about a ping
<MeteorVenture> i've found that you can effectively deal with a crush.. by quitting thinking about it and avoiding those people
<Pantsshy> ...So why did you ping him?
<Mason_Trowel> He did it on accident
<Mason_Trowel> He mentione that somebody had A solo in a song
<Azure_CoalSpark> brb i need to make dafodil sammich
<Pantsshy> Why didn't he just say that?
<Pantsshy> Ah
<Mason_Trowel> It inadvertently pinged solo
*Solo just goes off and dies.
<Pantsshy> Lol.
<TrollightSparkle> Now THAT is hard as hell, IMO. Music is my medicine for that.
<MrMooMoo> Have fun.
<TuxRug> That's the ping? I thought he was talking about something that happened when I clicked info.
<Pantsshy> -__(\
<Mason_Trowel> No
<Xiagu|PastSins> Mason_Trowel, SWEETIEBELLE uses Backup Singers! It's super effective!
*Pantsshy facehoof -_(\
<Solo> Xiagu: Lawl.
<Pantsshy> So
<MrMooMoo> So
<Xiagu|PastSins> sadfact: you can't name your pokemon SWEETIEBELLE, it's too long :(
<Sockwear_Moon> lo
<TrollightSparkle> extremely hard*
<Kencolt> Um... That should be easy.. I never actually MET her, just, well saw pictures and heard about her and... stuff like that.
<BlacklightWorking> So
<Pantsshy> Spitfire X Fluttershy: Spitshy? or Flutterfire?
<Sockwear_Moon> Lo
<Xiagu|PastSins> APPLEBLOOM and SCOOTALOO are legit, though.
<Spose> Omg, you know what'd be awesome for Fighting is Magic? Cutie Mark Crusaders!
<Mason_Trowel> Sweetie Belle is great. I can't wait till my Dumb Fabric shirt arrives.
<BlacklightWorking> FlutterFire
<BlacklightWorking> definitely FlutterFire
<Spose> Works like pokemon trainer in Brawl.
<Solo> All three CMC as one character. Nice idea.
<Pantsshy> I"m looking for something with an "N" in it
<MrMooMoo> Spitshy sounds, strange.
<BlacklightWorking> or maybe FireShy
<Kencolt> I guess I'm just a fancub.
<BlacklightWorking> 2^
<Pantsshy> To make SpitShyNe
<Xiagu|PastSins> Spose, because everypony totally /loves/ that game mechanic
<MeteorVenture> music + crush = orange crush
<Spose> I guess the only problem is that you'd have to be smacking little children around.
<BlacklightWorking> lol Pantsshy
<TuxRug> a cutie mark cerberus-pony?
<BlacklightWorking> wut
<Spose> I don't know if I could hit Fluttershy, let alone sweetiebell
<Pantsshy> TugRux: wat
<Pantsshy> I could hit Sweetie Belle /WITH/ Fluttershy
*Pantsshy picks up Fluttershy
<Sockwear_Moon> Fluttershy automatically wins all fights because at the mere thought of harming Fluttershy the opponent breaks out into tears.
<BlacklightShining> …
*Pantsshy equips Fluttershy
<Mason_Trowel> I could hit Fluttershy /WITH/ Sweetie Belle.
<MeteorVenture> this anime just got alot more interesting
<Mason_Trowel> And that would be awesome.
<Pantsshy> Sockwear_moon: are you Apple Cider or Chef Sande?
<BlacklightShining> WTF, Pantsshy!
<TuxRug> I couldn't hit anypony. That's just mean.
<Sockwear_Moon> wat?
<Pantsshy> Which one.
<Sockwear_Moon> Neither? I confus
<Mason_Trowel> Wait, what?
<Pantsshy> *sandy
<TuxRug> Although Trixie sometimes makes me want to kick something.
<Sumica> what now that it's over? =p
*TuxRug gently kicks a vase, and it wobbles.
<Mason_Trowel> Sockwear isn't either of the people from Bronyville podcast, methinks.
<MrMooMoo> I could use my udder cannons to wet her.
<Pantsshy> Cyril ships Twixie.
<Pantsshy> It's official.
<Sockwear_Moon> I don't even know who they are, lol.
<Xiagu|PastSins> Sockwear_Moon, Fluttershy attacks by being moe and adorable. Level 1 super is her squeaky smile sound effect
<Xiagu|PastSins> ^ made that up
<Mason_Trowel> Ugh
<Xiagu|PastSins> ^^ should totally be true anyway
<Pantsshy> ^Duh
<Pantsshy> ...
<Pantsshy> At the first one
<Kencolt> Ok, over proud much?
<Sockwear_Moon> Fluttershy is best pokemon.
<Azure_CoalSpark> fluttershys rubber ducky squeak?
<Pantsshy> Geez, Ninjas.
<Pantsshy> Her "Grin" sound.
<Azure_CoalSpark> oh lol
<Sumica> so more of the same or something else?
<Pantsshy> "I'm the world Champ, you know. Betcha can't beat me!"
<MeteorVenture> lol i guess so..
<Pantsshy> BATTLE--
<Pantsshy> START!
<Xiagu|PastSins> ^ squeak
<Pantsshy> OMFG yes!
<MrMooMoo> She could replace chancey in the pokecenter
<Xiagu|PastSins> Pantsshy, oh shit
<Pantsshy> Fluttershy is the boss.
<Xiagu|PastSins> Pantsshy, DO WANT
<Spose> I can't wait to play as Trixie. Or even beat on Trixie. Either/or.
<Kencolt> And again, 10 million flutershys. Becaue i LIKE it.
<Sumica> resetting stream.
<MeteorVenture> shows seem to get most interesting near the end anyway.. a big finish in other words
<Thunder_Dash> man, I had to go AFK to avoid my parents being mad at me for staying up late, came back to the end of this
<Pantsshy> Hey dawg
<Azure_CoalSpark> or this noise http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZkv9cTQ2Mg
<MeteorVenture> 10 million fluttershy's and they would still be in short supply for all the fanboys
<Pantsshy> I heard you like Trixie so I put Trixie with your Trixie so you can hurt Trixie while you Trixie.
<TrollightSparkle> Indeed.
<Sumica> back up
<Mason_Trowel> That sounds almost like a caption for that pic of Trixie holding a Trixie picture and Trixie plush.
<Kencolt> Yeah, well... I can see that... but one Twilight Sparkle is enough for me.
<MrMooMoo> How do you "trixie"?
<Azure_CoalSpark> no pony loves trixie as much as trixie loves trixie
*Kencolt hides his head under his paws again. "I just said that out loud, didn' I?"
<Sockwear_Moon> I bet Trixie's blanket has a picture of Trixie on it.
<Sumica> This is called Steliva of the universe
<MeteorVenture> ya i know.. i wouldn't want more than 1
<Barry> Hi guys
<Mason_Trowel> In Gollum's voice: "I told you she was..."Trixie"...
<Sumica> Hi Barry
<Thunder_Dash> hi again, Barry :P
<Mason_Trowel> :P
<MeteorVenture> on the other hand more than 1 of me would be kinda cool.. we would be bro's.. and drive each other insane saying the same joke all the time and knowing what each other is thinking
<Solo> Mason_Trowel:.... nice
<Azure_CoalSpark> The Great and Powerful Trixie demands more Trixie fic n pics
<Barry> Hey, if Nintendo gave the green light to make another Super Mario movie, how do you think it would be received?
<TrollightSparkle> More than 1 of me would be interesting.
<Kencolt> Barry? I have not met a barry?
<Azure_CoalSpark> *fics n pics
*MrMooMoo is still waiting for ballad
<Sumica> Poorly I would guess
<TrollightSparkle> And Barry, no idea, but after the things I've heard about the last one..
<MrMooMoo> Of TwilightSparkle
<MeteorVenture> lol barry i would watch it
<Thunder_Dash> Depends, if they make it live-action I can see it being another "So Bad It's Good" deal
<MeteorVenture> also i think it wouldn't be received so poorly if it had no relation to the last one
<Barry> I've heard of an unofficial Ocarina of Time movie. I hope Nintendo greenlights an official version
<Kencolt> Then again, I doubt Barry has met me...
<TrollightSparkle> Know what I'm still waiting on?
<Sockwear_Moon> 'tis what I'm waiting for myself.
<TrollightSparkle> A Metroid movie.
<MeteorVenture> real socks for your pet pony?
<TrollightSparkle> >.>
<Barry> Especially with 3DS reigniting the wonder of OoT
<MeteorVenture> oh ya that'd be awesome
<MeteorVenture> mother for the 3DS
<Sockwear_Moon> But there is not nearly enough Trixie in my image folder.
<MrMooMoo> Did the author die?
<TrollightSparkle> Oh my god, Mother would be amazing
<Thunder_Dash> Speaking of which, I hope that the fan outburst is large enough to warrant Nintendo making Majora's Mask 3D
<MeteorVenture> nah i won't own a 3DS but hey that'd still be cool
<Mason_Trowel> You know, I still don't have a "Pony" folder...
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm...
<Barry> There was one in production, I think, but it ended up in Development Hell
<Solo> Me neither
<Solo> I do have a few images on my PC though
<TrollightSparkle> If they could do an official Mother 3.. I'd buy a 3DS.
<Solo> mostly for lulz.
<MrMooMoo> Me neither
<Xiagu|PastSins> Sockwear_Moon, you saw the pic of Trixie in bed next to a Trixie photo cuddling a Trixie plushie, right?
<TrollightSparkle> I still haven't finished Mother 3 though :P
<Sockwear_Moon> Yeah, I've got it saved to my Pony folder.
<Barry> I doubt they'd release Mother 3, except on virtual console as is
<MeteorVenture> i just got done playing earthbound zero for the first time like yesterday
<Pantsshy> Hey guys
<MrMooMoo> Only good ipod wallpapers i save
<Pantsshy> read the comments here
<Xiagu|alseep> nopony saw that
<Sockwear_Moon> You still spelled it wrong.
<Pantsshy> I have succeeded at counter trolling
<Pantsshy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGnF80eHeMU&feature=related
<TrollightSparkle> I've been meaning to play Earthbound Zero, how was it?
<Sockwear_Moon> :P
<MeteorVenture> btw LOL not hard:P to all the people saying it is
<Barry> like they did with the Wii and how they'd release some Japanese games on VC
<MeteorVenture> but it was harder than the usual fare
<Mason_Trowel> The only pic I have so far is the Applebloom Karate-kicking gi because it's adorable when set to the song "Moskau" by Dschingis Khan.
<Mason_Trowel> *gif
<Barry> How many people knew that Starfox Adventures didn't start out as a Starfox game?
<Pantsshy> Guys?
<TrollightSparkle> Huh?
<Pantsshy> Please briefly evaluate Elvensith001's counter trolling
<Pantsshy> At that link.
<TrollightSparkle> You mean gameplay wise or plot wise?
<MeteorVenture> i liked EBZ.. it was interesting.. it never got particularly boring unless i decided to do something ridiculous that i knew i wouldn't save for a couple hours straight and it was extremely repetitive.. which i did
<Barry> Plotwise
<TrollightSparkle> Really?
*Sockwear_Moon has passed out at the keyboard.
<Barry> Yeah, it started out as a game for the N64 called Dinosaur Planet
<MrMooMoo> Well troll wasnt really a good troll
<Thunder_Dash> I remember hearing it wasn't a Star Fox game originally, but I had no idea what it actually started as
<TrollightSparkle> Strange. I liked Starfox Adventures though.
<Pantsshy> So, do I win?
<Solo> There's a pony named Oatmeal.
<Pantsshy> I especially like the finisher, I'm getting really good at those, I think.
<MrMooMoo> You responded to a troll.
<Solo> Pinkie Pie's comment, explained.
*Xiagu|alseep (سಥ益ಥ)س
*Xiagu|alseep just wanted to make that face
<Colgate> I don't see a face
*Xiagu|alseep /)^ε^(\
<Barry> but Nintendo pressured Rare into adding Star Fox. That took a while, and by the time it was ready, The Gamecube was popular, so it was released on that as Star Fox Adventures
<Azure_CoalSpark> it looks like constipated darth vader face
*BlacklightShining pings Sketchy_Sounds (Freeze wanted in the Bucket in five minutes)
<Barry> or at least, that's what I heard
<Pantsshy> lol
<Pantsshy> Azure.
<Sketchy_Sounds> OK
<Sockwear_Moon> Is that the Y U NO guy and Rainbow Dash's awesomefaec?
<Pantsshy> That's terrible.
<Pantsshy> ^Yes, Socks.
<MeteorVenture> what's this anime?
<Barry> I knew it started out as Dinosaur Planet, though
<Sumica> Stellvia
<Azure_CoalSpark> its terrible....but true
<Thunder_Dash> Stellvia of the Universe
<Sockwear_Moon> Woo, I can read ASCII.
<MrMooMoo> I cant send why wub you face
<MeteorVenture> i recognize that jar of stuff.. why do i recognize that jar of stuff?
<MrMooMoo> It wont let me
<Sumica> Plot element.
<MeteorVenture> and alright thanks!
<MrMooMoo> Why /)^3^(\
<MeteorVenture> never saw this show before
<MeteorVenture> i don't think
<Pantsshy> brb, gotta troll Mafia game.

<MrMooMoo> I were saying?

<Octavia> goodnight, ponies. I am dead tired and my mate wants me to sleep

<Pantsshy> WOOO!
<Pantsshy> Hey, goodnight, Octavia!
<Solo> Good night Octavia. Sleep well.
<Pantsshy> <3!
<Sockwear_Moon> What is this... 'Sleep' thing you speak of.
<Pantsshy> Love you, doll.
<Azure_CoalSpark> oh god, maskau...the literal version of this song has haunted my dreams for years
<Pantsshy> Oh no, my chat broke. Darn it!
<Azure_CoalSpark> Night Octavia
<Sockwear_Moon> Is it anything like that 'outside' thing people keep going on about?
<Sumica> Sounds like a flavor for indigestion.
<Sockwear_Moon> Lol portal
<Marshmelon> Octavia still here?
<Marshmelon> Goodnight, Octavia!
<Marshmelon> X----X
<Sockwear_Moon> Nope
<Marshmelon> Eeeenope.
<Sockwear_Moon> I think everyone had a sugar crash.
<MrMooMoo> Helooo Marshmelon where have you been?
<Leonon> http://thechive.com/2011/09/07/whatever-happens-dont-say-awwwww-35-photos/
<Marshmelon> On MAfiaScum.net
<Marshmelon> .../forum
<Marshmelon> The post is here
<Marshmelon> http://www.mafiascum.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3414327#p3414327
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Marshmelon> Read... maybe the previous two posts.
<Marshmelon> But that's the real gold.
<MrMooMoo> 12% battery left..
<Sockwear_Moon> Wat
<Sockwear_Moon> Is that a lion tongue bathing a doe?
<Wockstar> am i a bad person if i didnt saw awww?
<Wockstar> say*
<MeteorVenture> that girl truly understands the gravity of the situation
<Thunder_Dash> dat visor
<Spose> I almost awww'd at the otter being fed and the rat eating noodles, but otherwise I only smiled.
<Sockwear_Moon> I didn't say aww, but I said 'wat' a couple of times.
<Wockstar> i was like 'Meh'
<Spose> I mean, I'm exposed to fluttershy daily. Its hard to make me daww with kittens and such anymore.
<Azure_CoalSpark> I agree with Spose
<Sockwear_Moon> Like. That Llama.
<Sockwear_Moon> The shaved Llama. Wat.
<Wockstar> i was like LOL
<Marshmelon> Leonon: I eventually grew so disgusted that I closed it. Why did you link us to ten-thousand pictures of pugs?
<sotha> I'm Ayaku, and I've never seen you before.
<Sumica> Symbolism!
<sotha> And I know Everyone, and that means EVERYONE is Stellvia.
<Wockstar> pugs are weird
<MeteorVenture> next to me is john
<Sockwear_Moon> And the lion bathing the fawn/doe/deer/critter made me go wat.
<MrMooMoo> Why dont people eat cats?
<Marshmelon> Marshmelon: "Ew, dog."
<Solo> YES. This is what I want to mod into Street Fighter IV.
<Solo> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sonic-rainboom.jpg
<sotha> So if I've never seen you before, then that means you're NEW!
<Marshmelon> MrMooMoo: they can't catch them.
<Solo> It's like everything awesome about Guile, Sonic Boom, Sonic Rainboom, Rainbow Dash and Shoryuken all at once.
<sotha> And if you're new, then you need a PAR-TAY!
<Marshmelon> Heh.
<MrMooMoo> People eat dogs...
<Thunder_Dash> And if you're new, that means you haven't met anyone yet!
<Marshmelon> Dogs are stupid
<MeteorVenture> inb4 tinkerbell turns on wendy
<Marshmelon> and not good for much else
<Wockstar> people eat food
<Marshmelon> And easy to catch
<sotha> Such good memories.
<Azure_CoalSpark> Because for some strange reason its culturally unacceptable to eat cats for who knows y, also i dont think cats would taste that good or really have much meet (says the guy who likes to eat squirrel)
<Marshmelon> Cats are hard to catch, full of gristle, boundless utility...
<Solo> Vietnamese eat cats.
<Sumica> Seen this one have you Sol?
<MrMooMoo> Why do people eat cows?
<Marshmelon> Azure: Someponies eat cats...
<MrMooMoo> WHY
<Wockstar> i eat noodles
<Fireant> A question.
<Marshmelon> MrMooMoo: THEY ARE EASY TO CATCH.
<Leonon> because cows are full of yummy meat
<sotha> SEE?! I told you they had a party.
<sotha> (No.)
<Leonon> they're like pinyatas filled with meat
<Marshmelon> You hit them with a stick and steaks fall out?
*MrMooMoo hides
*Azure_CoalSpark just realized he has no idea how this convo got started
<Marshmelon> Lolololol
<Fireant> Little foals probably drink milk from their mother breast. So we assume that CMC are not so little to continue drinking milk? Or Sweetie Belle and Applebloom use AJ and Rarity in that purpose?
<Azure_CoalSpark> also a meat pinyata would be epic, sounds like something Epic meal Time should do
<MrMooMoo> They could drink my milk.
<Mason_Trowel> ... :O
<Marshmelon> Does that assume that Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom are the DAUGHTERS of AJ & R?
<Marshmelon> Because, you know...
<Marshmelon> They're not.
<Marshmelon> .__.
<Spose> I'm having a hard time rejoining this conversation while staying PG.
<Fireant> Have you seen AJ and Rarity mothers around?
<Sumica> I think somthing with a bit more action is in order. hope you all don't mind the not sticking to one show.
<TrollightSparkle> Oh it's fine.
<Fireant> Its a serious question and have nothing to do with sex :p
<MrMooMoo> In the future yes.
<Leonon> they're probably weened since they can talk
<Marshmelon> Have you seen AJ in downtime from having a foal?
<Azure_CoalSpark> All ponies spawned from the princess
<Thunder_Dash> I'm fine with that too :P
<Mason_Trowel> Supposedly more of the Mane 6's families are gonna show up in season two. Word of Sibsy. ^_^
<Marshmelon> Oh
<Fireant> True that.
<Marshmelon> SHOW up/
<Marshmelon> I thought you said "GROW up.
<TrollightSparkle> Test
<Sumica> pass
<Marshmelon> "More of their families Grow up! The mane six stay the same age, though"
<Marshmelon> >:V
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
<TrollightSparkle> Ghost in the Shell?
<sotha> Hello.
<Sumica> yes
<sotha> Now this is something I can get into.
<MeteorVenture> ghost in the stellvia
<TrollightSparkle> I have not seen this.
<sotha> first season
<Marshmelon> (just like in ALL cartoons)
<Leonon> well obviously age works in Equestria like it does in The Sims, they suddenly grow up and change size to adult form
<sotha> That means it's the laughing man, right? I can't remember.
<Sumica> Ghost in the shell:stand alone complex first gig
<Marshmelon> Guys, see you later! It's almost 1 AM here, and so my internet is going to shit off
<Sumica> Correct
<Marshmelon> wtf, there is a chinese weather report on TV.
<Azure_CoalSpark> night Marshmelon
<Leonon> g'night
<Mason_Trowel> Bye, Marshmelon
<Fireant> Begone Marshmelon.
<Thunder_Dash> I haven't seen this before either, I've heard of it though
<MrMooMoo> Night Marshmelon drink milk!
<Spose> I could take some good guesses as to the whereabouts of the parents. Or, they could go the disney route and murder every parent ever.
<sotha> Looks like I'll be staying up later tonight than I though.
<frostybrand> heh, turned on my comp, had this page on idle in the background. was wondering what the anime was coming from XD
<sotha> *thought
<JanusII> We already know that ponies woohoo.
<Marshmelon> Leonon: Sure. The other thing that might work is that Snails is an adolescent.
<TrollightSparkle> Hello frosty
<Marshmelon> He's got the growth spurt.
<Sumica> lol Hi frostybrand
<Azure_CoalSpark> as long as they dont all talk in "wub wub wub"... like charlie brown not like dubstep
<Marshmelon> Spose: Disney doesn't murder every parent...
<Marshmelon> They turn them evil.
<Sumica> broke that arm
<Leonon> adult ponies talking in dubstep...
*sotha loves Yoko Kanno music.
<Marshmelon> Oh, except, like, the half-stepmothjer... okay
<frostybrand> 11hmmm
<Marshmelon> CharlieBrown Adult Dubstep somehow appeals to me.
<Fireant> Marshmelon, sleep is waiting for you.
<Fireant> Shoo!
<Marshmelon> No, I"m not going to sleep
<Sumica> and yes it's the dub
<Fireant> Shoo be do!
<Spose> Every parent in a disney move is evil or dead. The only exception I think is The Little Mermaid.
<Marshmelon> Y U always so eager to get rid of me?
<Sumica> carefull frostybrand taht can get you kicked
<frostybrand> 0wait where's the rules at?
<Fireant> Because I don't like you.
<Leonon> great, now I want to download Charlie Brown and replace the adults talking with dubstep. Thanks Azure, look what you've done
<Marshmelon> Spose: Tangled, but that's not a classic...
<MrMooMoo> DRiNK MiLK
*sotha doesn't mind the dub.
<TrollightSparkle> Bottom of page
<Marshmelon> Of course.
<Spose> The mother is evil in that.
<Marshmelon> No
<Marshmelon> The withc is evil in that
<frostybrand> 0ah. no colors? aww...
<Mason_Trowel> Sleeping Beauty
<Marshmelon> Baby-napped.
<MeteorVenture> dang backspace
<MrMooMoo> Search it on youtube!
<Mason_Trowel> Both her parents are alive
<Spose> Oh, right.
<Marshmelon> And not the sleepy kind, either.
<Mason_Trowel> And not evil
<Sumica> http://www.dinkypage.com/115136
<MeteorVenture> i was gonna make a joke about AD 2101
<sotha> War was beginning.
<Marshmelon> Aladdin.
<Sumica> the war began?
<Spose> Still, she grew up with her as a mother
<Marshmelon> ?
<Spose> and she was evil
<Spose> Aladdin had parents?
<Thunder_Dash> I need to get up early for school tomorrow, but since I've already taken melatonin and can't get to sleep, I'm gonna stay up instead :P
<Sumica> herd mind
<MeteorVenture> yep
<sotha> What happen
<Marshmelon> PC had a pappa
<sotha> Someone set up us the bomb
<Thunder_Dash> SOMEONE SET US UP THE BOMB
<Marshmelon> *PJ
<MrMooMoo> This is totally pony related.
<Mason_Trowel> Aladdin's father was disappeared until the third movie, and his mother is deceased.
<MeteorVenture> for great justice
<sotha> Oh good times. Good times.
<Spose> I only saw the originals.
<Sumica> this is another anime where i like the dub as much as the sub.
<Spose> Speaking of movies that make grown men cry, who saw the Luna video earlier on the front page of EQD?
*Dumori wounders how banned he'd get for hookign cleverbot up to this IRC
*sotha like Cowboy Bebop.
<Leonon> The Little Mermade 2 had both parents alive, right?
<Mason_Trowel> I actually really enjoyed the third movie. It's the only Disney sequel I can say that about, barring the Toy Story franchise.
<Fireant> Spose, link pls.
<frostybrand> 0well, back to what I was doing, TTYL
<Sumica> yep, that was earlyer though sotha
*TrollightSparkle has no idea what the eff you guys are talking about.
<Mason_Trowel> I saw, spose
<sotha> WHAT?
<TrollightSparkle> And bye frosty
<sotha> I missed COWBOY BEBOP!
<Mason_Trowel> The manly tears were flowing like waterfalls.
<Thunder_Dash> I'm not a mod, but if you managed to get Cleverbot to sing Winter Wrap-Up, I wouldn't mind. :P
<Sumica> just one ep
<frostybrand> 0howza emote?

<Mason_Trowel> Watch it, Leonon. It's worth the tears.
<Marshmelon> Good night!!
*Leonon sees the video's name "Oh god no"
<Marshmelon> I don't like that song though...
<Marshmelon> Dumb song!
<Marshmelon> (Sweetie Belle)
<Sumica> pray and spray
<Spose> I managed to watch the whole thing and shed one tear. I consider myself a callous monster.
<Mason_Trowel> Nah
<Mason_Trowel> You're not a callius monster
<Balloons> When she loved me? The toy story 2 song?
<Mason_Trowel> Yes
<MeteorVenture> all these advanced persecoms running around
<Mason_Trowel> *callous
<TrollightSparkle> Wait.. so people have metal brains?
<Sumica> dat chobits reference.
<sotha> They have prosthetic bodies.
<TrollightSparkle> I mean, people are cyborgs in this?
<TrollightSparkle> Oh.
<Sumica> cyberbrains
<Leonon> I'll watch the video later...maybe...
<sotha> There are cyborgs too.
<Spose> As a hardcore luna fan, I dont know why I didnt cry on Pinkie Pie levels from it.
<Spose> Its a beautifully made video Leo.
<sotha> Bato, right?
<Sumica> yes
<MeteorVenture> catch coma!
<Spose> Definetly bookmark it or something.
<Leonon> I did
<Sumica> tachcoma
<Azure_CoalSpark> BRB showertime
<Thunder_Dash> Bah, I play too much Ace Attorney, the runner reminds me of one of the guys in GK2
*Sumica wonders if this has the tachicomatic days shorts at the end.
<Leonon> Marshmelon's asleep, post pugs
<Fireant> Jesus, Finally.
<Fireant> One day I ban that troll into abyss.
<RainbowDash> Oh, is this what a normal chat looks like?
<Spose> I can't believe I'm eating a Fruit by the Foot for like, the first time since 5th grade
<MeteorVenture> cyborg contractors with death notes and geass powers would be kinda cool
<Sumica> nah would be too op
<MeteorVenture> obviously lol
<Mason_Trowel> Man, Spose, you linked the vid, so I had to watch it again...Now I'm all sad and stuff.
<Sumica> besides geas and Dk would almost be redundant.
<sotha> His Thpecial Talent!
<MeteorVenture> not really.. also fluttershy has geass powers
<Spose> I think your the second person ever to watch a vid I've linked.
<sotha> true
<MeteorVenture> wait.. dk?
<Mason_Trowel> ...Why's that?
<Sumica> lol some one needs to make that pmv
<Spose> Read "Ballad of Twilight Sparkle" or Elements of Gaming. That'll cheer you up.
<Sumica> Death Knote =p
<Spose> I dunno. IRC is usually moving too fast for people to watch stuff.
*Sumica is tired
<MeteorVenture> lol ya that's what i thought:P
<MeteorVenture> donkey kong with geass = OP
<Mason_Trowel> Hmm, I see.
<Sumica> dubing over staremaster clips with code geass audio
<Leonon> people click on my links all the time, but I link a lot
<Sumica> Dirty old man likes to be a geasha robot when drunk.
<MeteorVenture> there was already a picture with her doing there stare with her eye edited to be geass-y
<Sockwear_Moon> wat
<sotha> Weaping ANgel!
<sotha> She turned her back
<Spose> If people do click on my links, I never get a comment about the vids. I linked a Guile's Theme of Rainbow Dash earlier.
<Sumica> lol
<Mason_Trowel> I cheered myself up by reading that Rainbow Dash comic.
<Thunder_Dash> Don't look away, and DON'T BLINK
<Spose> Which I think fit the show better than the actual show.
<MeteorVenture> the stare*
<sotha> Oh wow. And now the TV in the sun room that my uncle watched all day every day while on his laptop is realllllllly loud static.
<sotha> he probably passed out or something
<Sumica> wooooo.
<Mason_Trowel> Ah, I'm sorry, Spose.
<Mason_Trowel> I'd actually seen it already.
<Mason_Trowel> But I probably should've said so.
<Sumica> not the NEIPA
<Spose> No worries. Seth came in and got everyones attention around the same point anyway.
<Spose> How do you do that thing where you bold a name to make the beep?
<RainbowDash> You type out the users name
<Sumica> heh notice the glare on his glasses. love the symbolism
<MeteorVenture> does UP3 ring a bell for anyone?
<Mason_Trowel> It bolds the name only on the receiving person's end.
*sotha did not notice. What was the symbolism?
<RainbowDash> Like this: Spose
<MeteorVenture> dat alarm clock sound
<Wockstar> Spose
<Wockstar> :D
<Mason_Trowel> You type out the name and send it. It pings the person whose name it is to inform them that someone is talking about them.
<MeteorVenture> it's unrelated btw.. just wondering
<Spose> Mason_trowel
<Sumica> glare on the glass meens diffrent things like only one eye, is for like. Not who they seem to be or two faced.
<Lysiria> A "highlight" in most clients
<Wockstar> Wockstar
<Wockstar> ...
<Mason_Trowel> You didn't capitalize the 't' in Trowel
<MeteorVenture> underdeveloped planetary protection pact
<sotha> Oh okay.
<Wockstar> :(
<Balloons> Like with mine, i added Celestia to the Ping list, So i know when she is being talked about :)
<RainbowDash> Also known as a ping
<Leonon> if you ping everyone at once Fireant comes on and kicks you
<Octavia> 13Oooh, Ghost in The Shell.
<Solo> Wockstar
<Spose> Ah. Case sensitive.
<Sumica> TV tropes has a topic on it.
<Wockstar> YES!
<Mason_Trowel> I believe so.
<Sumica> Yep Octavia
<Wockstar> Solo
<Solo> You're welcome.
<Octavia> 13:P
<Spose> Solo
<RainbowDash> Yeah, and don't ping Fireant unless you really need him
<RainbowDash> whoops
<Solo> Hahahaha.
<Wockstar> PING ALL THE THINGS!
<Mason_Trowel> Lol
*RainbowDash is sooooo dead
<Solo> Nice one, RD.
<Spose> Guessing it doesnt bold for the person who says it
*Lysiria hides RainbowDash under a table.
<Mason_Trowel> No
<Solo> Spose: right
<Sumica> that must realy mess up some ones head.
<Mason_Trowel> Only for the receiver
<Spose> Kay. Thanks!
<Sumica> having your brain removed and pluged in a box.
*Fireant lurk in.
<Mason_Trowel> No problem
*Fireant growl at the pings.
<sotha> Eh. Happens every day.
<Thunder_Dash> haha, yeah
<Wockstar> PING@
<Spose> Wheres the ping list thingy?
<Spose> I want to add Luna to it. :D
<Mason_Trowel> No idea
<Lysiria> If you're on the webchat, you can't changei t
<sotha> I mean, it happened to Sethisto, right?
<Solo> Depends on your client, Spose.
<Spose> Ah. Nevermind then.
<Fireant> Lolo.
<Wockstar> Solo
<Sumica> suddlly thinking of 7 heads in a duffle bag.
<Solo> Lolo? Is that, like, a horrible nickname for me?
*Fireant sniggers at the webchaters.
<sotha> o.o
<Fireant> No, Han.
<Fireant> You are Han.
<Sumica> it's a movie Sol
<Wockstar> LOL
*Solo uses Trillian, and consequently had to manually code the pinging/highlighting feature.
<Wockstar> i see what u did there
<MeteorVenture> on a side note i type in "underde" in google and get.. underdeveloped breasts as the first suggestion.. WAT?
*Solo has never heard that joke before, Fireant. Not even once in this chat. >.<
<Sumica> google safe search fail
<sotha> Why were you typing underde? Is this a guessing game?
<Fireant> You see?
<Fireant> I beat them all.
<sotha> underdead?
<Thunder_Dash> that's google autocomplete, for you
<Lysiria> lolwat
<Solo> .....
<sotha> underdealt hands in poker?
<Wockstar> MAGICS?!
<Solo> And that, my friends, is how a troll makes their exit in style :P
*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out Wockstar's shouting
<Wockstar> sorry..
<Mason_Trowel> It actually has been said before, Solo.
<sotha> underdeveloped countries?
<Spose> De magicks!
<Mason_Trowel> You just missed those times, I guess
<Solo> Mason_Trowel... I was being sarcastic.
<MeteorVenture> i was looking up underdeveloped planetary protection pact
<MeteorVenture> UP3
<Mason_Trowel> >.<
*Solo dies.
*sotha has never heard of it.
<Mason_Trowel> Hard to tell in a text-based setting
<Sumica> boo no tachicomatic days in this one.

*Solo is just being a jerk, now. Sorry.

<MeteorVenture> but my brother beat it anyway
<Sockwear_Moon> Your dead. Bring them out.
<Solo> Sorry, Wockstar. I'd go commit seppuku, but, it's a little late for that.
<TrollightSparkle> Guise what game are we talking about?
<Sumica> Star ocean
<Solo> Sockwear: This one isn't quite dead yet. Is that okay?
*Wockstar is no-longer crying
<sotha> Guise?
<MeteorVenture> we only played the first 1
<Wockstar> ok im done crying now
<MeteorVenture> sounds like guys
<Solo> Now it's time for vengeance?
<Sumica> the pst one was the second one, the first one was only released here in the US last year.
<sotha> Yeah, but I think Guise would be a cool name to go by.
<Wockstar> if you say so
<Sumica> er ps2
<Wockstar> Just wait here
<Sumica> dis guise ^_^
*Wockstar walks off into his room
<Aellos> *tests the waters* Hello?
<Azure_CoalSpark> hello Aellos
<Solo> Hi there. Welcome.
<Aellos> Hello :D
*Wockstar walks back out holding big knife
<scallywag> oh cool :D
<Aellos> O_O
<TrollightSparkle> PS2.. I remember hearing about Star Ocean, I just don't know if I've ever played it.
<sotha> It reminds me of my Roke's name.
<MeteorVenture> 1 letter away from guile
<Wockstar> so Solo
<Sumica> Hi scallywag
<Azure_CoalSpark> Wockstar your scaring Aellos
<TrollightSparkle> Hello scallywag

<Aellos> Yup, not new to EqD, but new to the IRC, just clicked it
<Aellos> Lol, continue Wockstar :D
<Wockstar> okie dokie
<Solo> Aellos: Indeed. I lurked on EQD for a while before coming here as well.
<Sockwear_Moon> loki
<Wockstar> now Solo
<Solo> Aellos
<MeteorVenture> this is kinda taking me back to final fantasy.. can't remember which one though
<Aellos> Lol, I just noticed the 'ponychats' button next to the page and went "hmmm"
<Sumica> F.U.N.E.X?
<Wockstar> where do you want to be stabbed first?
<sotha> Legend of Dragoon!
<MeteorVenture> with these machines around
<Solo> Sorry, stupid netbook keyboard. Aellos: Good crowd here. You should fit right in.
<MeteorVenture> i need to play that
<Aellos> Awesome. :D
<Sockwear_Moon> I was hesitant to hop on here since the last time I joined a community on IRC it did not end well. :P
<Spose> Bronies are cool people in general.
<Sumica> That game had some great cutseenes sotha
<Spose> Its why I like MLP.
<Aellos> I've noticed that.
<MeteorVenture> in fact i might play that really soon after earthbound
<Solo> Wockstar: Aim for my squeedly-spooch. It's in that jar over there.
<sotha> C.
<Sumica> and the combo attacks.
<Aellos> While a bit crazy, bronies are really nice. :D
<MeteorVenture> you need to play legend of legaia
<Wockstar> ok
<Solo> Spose: Yeah. Pretty much.
<User_9129> That button is shovelled in with banners as far as inattentive perception goes
<Azure_CoalSpark> Its sad but I actually used EqD for like 3 weeks before finding the ponychat button, I only found it cause I did a "MLPFiM chatroom" search
<Spose> I mean, you know its going to be a nice ride when the slogan is "We will love and tolerate the shit out of you"
<Sumica> I still reacall that one purple chicks "DIE MORE AND MORE!" line
*Wockstar stabs Solo's squeechie-squooch
<Aellos> Best motto evar
*Solo dodges.
<Wockstar> damn
<MeteorVenture> http://www.emuparadise.me/fup/up/37096-Legend_of_Legaia_(ccd)-2.jpg
<Sumica> now Xenogears was a truely long game.
<MeteorVenture> ooh
<Azure_CoalSpark> I actually used that at work the other day, some kid was tryin to act all tought, so I said the love and tolerate thing, he just got really confused and walked away
<User_9129> There's alot of kinda dickish bronies : (
<Aellos> and I can't stop watching that dern video that was posted earlier..
<Solo> I told you to aim at the squeedly-spooch, not my squeechie. I need that.
*Wockstar pulls out gun and shoots squeeshie-squooch
<Aellos> I want to say that to someone sometime
<Wockstar> oh
<Wockstar> sorry
*Solo dodges.
<Solo> Your aim sucks man.
<Wockstar> i does...
<Sockwear_Moon> Pff, there is no such thing as murder.
*Wockstar starts crying again
<Solo> I can fix that.
<User_9129> Ponies don't die, what're you talking about
*Solo removes Wockstar's tear ducts. Nothing bad could come of that!
<Spose> There is murder. But only for fish.
<Sumica> not a very well hidden sniper perch.
*Wockstar dies
<User_9129> NO
<Spose> As shown in Winter Wrap Up
<User_9129> THAT NEVER HAPPENED
<Solo> Spose: and only for Baron Awesome.
<User_9129> NONONONONO
<Balloons> No need for caps, User_9129.
<Azure_CoalSpark> Idk y but this conversation is making me want to turn Dr. Kevorkian into a pony pun but it isnt working
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: My Little Topgear in the Official Topgear Magazine (http://tinyurl.com/3brench)
<MeteorVenture> http://us.playstation.com/Content/OGS/SCUS-94254/Site/media/group_tree.jpg
<Sockwear_Moon> Poor fishies.
<MeteorVenture> there ya go.. legend of legaia!
<Spose> You would have thought Pinkie Pie would be the killer, but no, it was Fluttershy.
<MeteorVenture> that game needs more recognition
<Aellos> Well of course, they wouldn't love her?
<Sockwear_Moon> That episode made me wonder how Fluttershy would be on a date.
<Sockwear_Moon> And then I kind of got scared and hid.
<Spose> Well, you'd be doing most the talking.
<MeteorVenture> funny story though.. my brother played it a long time ago.. then later we bought it again and he was wondering if we knew he played it or if it was his or something like that
<Spose> Omg, I forgot to read Cross and Arrow part 9
<Spose> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Spose!
<Wockstar> so nobody cares that im dead
<Sockwear_Moon> lol wut
<Sockwear_Moon> I also don't really have the desire to read that fic for some reason.
<Aellos> What did you do Spose?
<Aellos> Wat?!
<Aellos> Lol, what was that?
<Sockwear_Moon> He mooned himself.
<Aellos> *snicker*
<Aellos> Really now?
<Wockstar> hehehe
<Wockstar> mooned
<User_9129> I want to grab Derpy's tail : (
<Aellos> Lol that was strannnge
<Sockwear_Moon> It is quite easy to moon yourself when ponies are involved. Not so much IRL.
<Wockstar> how was your trip Spose
<Spose> Cheese.
<Azure_CoalSpark> If you grab derpy's tail will muffins come out her mouth?
<Wockstar> Cheese is good
<Spose> It tasted like cheese.
<Solo> User_9129: type !moon to grab Derpy's tail and get kicked out of the chatroom
<Sockwear_Moon> Derpy's tail tasted like cheese?
<Solo> !muffinkiss
*DerpyBot regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches Solo, showing her most adorable kissing face
<Wockstar> ewwww
<User_9129> mmm
<Solo> Mmmmdelicious.
<Sockwear_Moon> Derpy is a minx.
<Sockwear_Moon> Also brb.
<Aellos> O_o
<Azure_CoalSpark> DerpyBot is best Bot
<Wockstar> Solo you still dead?
<Balloons> Yes, Derpybot has some, interesting commands...
<Solo> !makeout
*DerpyBot gives Solo a searching look and then flies off to #EquestriaAfterDark
<^BlacklightShining> apparently not, Wockstar
<Sumica> When I die I want to go on a tank rampage.
<Aellos> So....this Lunar Republic thing...I'm kinda wondering what that is about?
<Solo> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Solo> yes
<Spose> Must have been fun to program her.
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Solo
<HellishMuse> !oatmeal
<Spose> Lunar Republic?
<Spose> Is best republic.
<frostybrand> 0oh hey guys again. just saw this: http://www.ebay.com/itm/110740955959 its the rainbowdash cosplay costume. for sale.
<Solo> Aellos: It's a fan joke playing off of Trollestia. Knowyourmeme.com it.
<Aellos> Just one part of the bronydom I'm new to. I just got a piece of art added to the DA group
<Azure_CoalSpark> I am a proud member of the Lunar Republic
<Aellos> Hmm okay *runs after*
<Spose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0tYs5U5RI
<Sumica> Did't think he would sell it.
<Spose> That is what made me love the Lunar Republic.
<Sockwear_Moon> Twilight's Book Club is best club.
<sotha> I like this song too,
<MeteorVenture> wow so much money
<^BlacklightShining> I agree that that's a good song
<Sumica> Then again bronys seem to have alot of cash to throw around cant blame him for wanting to cash in.
<Spose> Luna pony is best pony.
<MeteorVenture> not unexpected
<TrollightSparkle> I know.. but 1 grand?
<Sumica> Sad song
<Balloons> Neigh
<^BlacklightShining> but I /don't/ agree that you should join the NLR just 'cause you like it
<sotha> and I consider that costume creepy. The joints are all wrong.
<Aellos> I knowyourmeme-ed it and didn't find anything lol
*^BlacklightShining is neutral in the Solar Empire | Lunar Republic thing
<Aellos> But awesome song
<Spose> I wasn't really "in" to MLP before that. I watched the show, but didn't care much for the fandom. Then I discovered notacleverpony
<Sumica> would be hard to wear it if they went the right way =p
<Solo> Aellos: KYM Trollestia
<Aellos> Ahhh okay
<sotha> But the right way is the only right way!
<Wockstar> ahhhh memebase
<Sockwear_Moon> I think I watched the entire first season on the day I saw the pilot after saying to myself, 'Just one wouldn't hurt.'
<Spose> I only pick a side on the Republic/Sol Empire because someday I want to play a RTS game where you can be those two.
<Sumica> I just hope it is only used as intended.
<Wockstar> where would i be without you?
<Spose> Outside?
<Aellos> Okay...this song...too awesome
<Wockstar> No
<Spose> I know. I can listen to it all day. And I have before.
<Azure_CoalSpark> This really is a good song
<Spose> My headphones are really good with bass, so I can just play it and close my eyes and get lost for a few mins.
<Solo> Aellos: The show is good, but not, in and of itself, truly amazing. What's amazing is the fans.
<MeteorVenture> gosh sumica.. y u gotta make me think about such things?
<Wockstar> damn backspace
<Spose> Yeah, what Solo said.
<Spose> I'd like the show, but I wouldn't love it without the fandom.
<Wockstar> eeeeee-yup
<Sumica> You filled in the blank your self I never said what the other uses could be =p
<frostybrand> 0ew.... crocs in the feet
<Solo> Aellos: There's enough art on EQ daily to fill every single gallery in New York, i'd wager. And several wonderful albums of music.
<Aellos> Agree wholly. Though I did like the show before the fandom, but then I got into the fandom and now I LOVE it
<Azure_CoalSpark> For me I loved the show, but I didnt really fangasm tell after running into the "Herd" and watching some commentary videos :P
<Sockwear_Moon> Not to mention all of the fics.
<Solo> Aellos: Stick on youtube and look for "notacleverpony" and "OdysseyEurobeat" for the two most well-known music artists.
<Spose> Now, off to finish Elements of Gaming 3.5, then read Chapter 9 for Cross and Arrow.
<Solo> Indeed. Not even mentioning the exceptional writing.
<Aellos> I think I've heard of both. :D
<MeteorVenture> you made me think of it by filling in the outlines
<Aellos> But yeah, I love how the fandom goes deeper into the character, especially those we don't see. :D
<sotha> The only pony that should be able to bend that way is Lyra.
<Spose> Before I go, going to link this. Been on EQD before but it doesn't have nearly as many views as I think it deserves. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhk_zDhVnjc&list=PL9DD00D6DAAB22053&index=17
<Sockwear_Moon> I finally got around to reading The Empty Room. Not sure what to expect. It shall be an interesting journey.
<Sumica> BS lightly used, I have seen what goes on at those fur cons. =p
<Solo> Oh, and a friend just linked me to this total LAWLfest.
<Solo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tReXtRiW7dI&feature=youtu.be
<Azure_CoalSpark> Cand I get nudge in the right direction to find some good fanfic? I have only read the grimdark stuff so far cause Id like to avoid some of the more nsfw stuff :\ (comes from anime background so assumes all fics are porn)
<User_9129> Cross and Arrow makes me : |
<Sockwear_Moon> Did you read Past Sins?
<Sumica> Soooooo more GITS or somthing else?
<sotha> Why is that?
<Solo> Azure: Use the sidebar, and under Categories, click Star-6.
<sotha> Love this song!
<User_9129> Past Sins makes me >: |
<Sumica> the bass on this song is insane in my car.
<Wockstar> lol
<Azure_CoalSpark> I shall do that, thanks Solo. and Iv only read Cupcakes and the first Silent Ponyville stories
<Wockstar> Solo
<Wockstar> that was
<Aellos> Past Sins is a hit or miss for people. I think it was good, but other's don't and I see why too.
<User_9129> There's some nicely written adventure stuff, some very nice shipping stuff
<Wockstar> awesome
<Sockwear_Moon> Male Twilight makes me scared.
<sotha> How late am I watching this compared to you?
<Solo> Azure: Indeed. I'd recommend Off the Edge of the Map for a good, non-grim non-ship story.
<MeteorVenture> there's 2 ways of getting a shape.. filling it in or filling in everything around it.. all i'm saying is you filled in everything around the idea
<Solo> Wockstar: I know, right?
<Wockstar> yay
<MeteorVenture> it took me long enough to explain that gosh
<Wockstar> i like crossovers the best
<Solo> Wockstar: Video editting: They haz it. I loved the rainbow-coloreed matrix screen too
<Sumica> indeed MeteorVenture
<Azure_CoalSpark> I dont mind shipping (and kinda like it actually) I just dont want porn
<mib_regzu6> EFFING BACKSPACE
<Solo> Wockstar: Videoedit win. For real.
<Wockstar> Solo: yea Barh
<Wockstar> Brah*
<Solo> Azure: Porn isn't allowd on EQD. and I recommended Off the Edge of the Map because it should be awesome to just about anyone. Give it a shot.
<Sockwear_Moon> I'm trying to think. Agh, what was it. Merely a Mare? The one where Trixie and Twilight do their mage's duel? I'd recommend that one.
<Spose> Do you like shipping, Azure_Coalspark?
<Spose> I have lots of good ship fics.
<Sockwear_Moon> Mares and Magic?
<Spose> Of Mares and Magixc
<Spose> *Magic
<Sockwear_Moon> That one, yeah.
<User_9129> That dragged on a bit, as I recall
<MeteorVenture> haha not really offline.. just a picture of it being offline
<Spose> REALLY good shipping story. Believable characters, plot development, and the best backround for Trixie I've ever read.
<MeteorVenture> tricky tricky
<Sockwear_Moon> Maybe. I like it though. And try out Ballad of Twilight Sparkle.
<sotha> Well, goodnight everypony. That is, unless there is more ---
<Azure_CoalSpark> brb
<Spose> http://maximillianveers.deviantart.com/art/Of-Mares-and-Magic-eReader-217273293 Thats the e-reader because one of EQD's chapter links is broken.
<MeteorVenture> goodnight sotha:D
<Sockwear_Moon> Beyond that I'm too out of it to remember names of fics.
<sotha> ~In this city of amnesia~
<TrollightSparkle> Alright guys, I'm heading off to bed.
<Sumica> there is more
<TrollightSparkle> And good night to you Sotha
<Wockstar> Better Living Through Science and Ponies is my fave fic
<Spose> Ballad of Twilight Sparkle is a better overall story. I just love Trixie's portrayl in Mares and Magic.
<Spose> I laughed many, many times in BoTS
<sotha> (Please let somepony have gotten that quote.)
<Thunder_Dash> See ya later, both of you
<Sumica> Big O
<Spose> On A Cross and Arrow is good too, which I'm reading right now.
<sotha> YAH
<MeteorVenture> cya later trollight!
<^BlacklightShining> ^
<Sockwear_Moon> Oh. Naw, you probably read Sunset.
<Sumica> this is not big O mind you
<^BlacklightShining> not reading it right now, but…yeah
<sotha> I should hope not.
<Sumica> This is macross
<MeteorVenture> what is this? i was going to play some earthbound and turn off the.. oh ok
<sotha> If it were Big O, we should have been watching the dub
<Sumica> Newdcd dose Big O
<sotha> Oh. Giant roobots. That's right.
<Aellos> Soo....now I want a dystopian themed pony fanfiction...is that bad?
<Dashite> Secret Armoury of General Knoxx is much harder than I remember...
<Solo> Aellos: Fallout Equestria.
<Serp> http://www.ebay.com/itm/110740955959 :o
<Aellos> Well, non-crossover
<sotha> I haven't played it yet!
<frostybrand> 0help me fox!
<Solo> search for star-6 grimdark. there are plenty.
<MeteorVenture> i was going to turn off the stream but that elvish looking girl (at least had the head accessories that are usual for elvish people) intrigued me
<sotha> All I have left to do are the DLC.
<Aellos> Cool, will do so then.
<Dashite> I just ran through the Crimson Lance base with my 60 (now 61) soldier. It was slow going.
<MeteorVenture> bogey on your tail!
<Sumica> Yeah that was Crest of the stars but not the first one so did't want to start you off mid show.
<MeteorVenture> should've tried a somersault
<Sockwear_Moon> Frigid Winds and Burning Hearts, Google Chrome Froze From The Amount of Awesome, Secret Tub Fun, Past Sins, The Night That Never Ended, Paradise...
<Sockwear_Moon> Definitely read The Sock Swap.
<Spose> Punching is Magic is probably the funniest short story I've ever read.
<Sockwear_Moon> In fact, just sort for Star-6.
<Sockwear_Moon> You'll find everything.
<Spose> http://necrodios.deviantart.com/art/WTG-7-MLP-Punching-is-Magic-255257327
<Azure> well damn, I went to sign in here on my actual IRC client and even tho I had left the webpage it still said someone else was using my name :\
<sotha> I only have a 47 or something like that. We should play sometime.
<frostybrand> 0of course, its red
<sotha> Er. . . siren
<Leonon> we should have a battle royalle to determine the best of the star 6's
<frostybrand> 0yellow? it looks red to me :S
<sotha> The sequel looks good though.
<Leonon> determine the best of the best
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-; Dariiiiiii...
<Solo> Leonon: Spiderses wins.
<Sumica> SOFN!
<Solo> It was elevated to GODLIKE status.
<frostybrand> 0heh it was red ^_^
<Azure_CoalSpark> HA! victory is mine
<Aellos> Hahaha
<Solo> I'd recommend you go read it, but it might break your brain from sheer awesome
<Solo> so we try to avoid mentioning it too much.
<MeteorVenture> >evolutionist propaganda
<Thunder_Dash> "Bird humans"
<MeteorVenture> lolololo
<Thunder_Dash> Maximum Ride? *hit*
*sotha doesn't know whether she should wait to see if Dashite is responding. . . or what.
<Dashite> Respond to what?
<Solo> Uh oh. Uh.... why hello there NMM.
<Dashite> Oh!
<Dashite> Missed that.
<Azure_CoalSpark> 0.o
<Serp> http://www.ebay.com/itm/110740955959
<Aellos> *backs away*
<Crainy> mmmmh ponyville in minecraft
<Serp> still amazing :v
<Serp> :C
<Crainy> that might actually drive me to play that game again
<MeteorVenture> edugah!
<Dashite> I've been working on a run with some friends right now actually.
<Dashite> Let me just check what other characters I have available.
<Azure_CoalSpark> Not even Ponyville can make me play minecraft
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Comic: Doctor Whoof in The Legend of the Lunar Shadow (Update Part 6!) (http://tinyurl.com/3jbmjoh)
<sotha> It's honestly been like a month since I last played. . . so. . . but I only have a week left to play before I go to college.
<^BlacklightShining> what!
<^BlacklightShining> DerpyBot was faster than Twitter that time
<Dashite> Closest I've got is either a 61 Soldier or a 36 Sniper. :/
<Synros> hey
<Synros> everyone
<MeteorVenture> what luck! those island natives speak japanese!
<Crainy> i actually dont think minecraft is that addicting
<Sumica> Is't it though
<Thunder_Dash> hi Synros
<sotha> I don't know. Would you want to do some stuff with me sometime or something?
<Sumica> Hi Synros
<Azure_CoalSpark> I never really could get into make ur own fun games :\
<Crainy> i actually like that
<Synros> i really hate the service provided Vonage.
<MeteorVenture> take that purple haired girl with you.. she seems like ownage
<Azure_CoalSpark> 1 exception being forge on halo
<Dashite> I'd be up for it. Just let me know if you want someone who will die really easy, or someone who can kill everything really easy.
<Crainy> but minecraft isnt that spectacular to me
<Azure_CoalSpark> and map maker on Black Hawk Down
<Dashite> What timezone are you in Sotha?
<Wockstar> i could never work forge
<frostybrand> 0did that say ASS-1?
<sotha> Pacific
<Wockstar> i would just fail
<Sumica> yes the ass1
<sotha> You?
<Synros> Internet: Sorry cannot connect to the internet. Phone: Sorry cannot connect to the Vonage network, please try again. Call them on a cell phone. and get told they are doing a system restart and will be down for several hours. And they didn't even bother giving us notice what they were doing
<Dashite> Eastern
<sotha> That's not too bad then.
<Azure_CoalSpark> I didnt have the patience to make the really intricate detailed stuff, but I could work a pretty good creative map when the urge struck
<frostybrand> 0heh, ass
<Dashite> Easier to co-ordinate than transatlantic.
<Synros> so I'm siting at a Starbucks right now... :(
<Sumica> FOKER!
<Wockstar> i just spawn tanks on people
<sotha> Well, I think it might be a little easier if. . . I don't know. it doesn't take that long to level up ten or so levels.
<sotha> But then I wouldn't want you to not have fun because you die really easily. . .
<Dashite> What did you say your character was?
<MeteorVenture> sin pie? sounds tempting
<Crainy> im thinking the whole time about ponyfying my desktop
<Crainy> but i just cant replace optimus prime
<Crainy> i just cant...
<sotha> Siren. She's in the 40's, or something.
<Wockstar> this is a school laptop so i cant
<Wockstar> sadly...
<Azure_CoalSpark> and so Pony Prime was born
<Dashite> Okay, power leveling a character isn't too hard it's getting some decent weapons for the level once you get there that can be the trick.
<Sockwear_Moon> Cloptimus Prime
<Azure_CoalSpark> haha yes
<^BlacklightShining> Ponimus Prime
<Wockstar> I dont even
<Sockwear_Moon> Pinkie Prime?
<Crainy> well
<Crainy> i have alot of awesome pinkie pictures
<Crainy> actually, i have awesome pictures of everything
<Sockwear_Moon> I've got Twilight's cutie mark as my desktop picture.
<Crainy> but cmon, its optimus prime
<Synros> question...what anime is this?
<sotha> I do have that one super awesome SMG that lights everything on fire.
<Sumica> macross Zero
<Sockwear_Moon> How about... Optimus Prime -and- ponies?
<sotha> But that is true
<MeteorVenture> what game yall talking about?
<Wockstar> how about optimus holding a pony?
<sotha> Borderlands
<Azure_CoalSpark> or how bout this
<Azure_CoalSpark> http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=pony+transformers#/d2v5vcc
<sotha> The Hellfire.
<Sockwear_Moon> Optimus with Applejack on his shoulder?
<MeteorVenture> alright thanks
<Crainy> lol
<Crainy> i actually made a picture where optimus prime has applejack on his shoulder
<Thunder_Dash> Mmm. I have Borderlands on Steam, but TBH it doesn't really appeal to me
<Wockstar> that would be awesome
<Crainy> but still
<sotha> http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Maliwan_Hellfire
<Crainy> its not as awesome as just optimus prime
<Sumica> So a girl your spear eh?
<Dashite> That's a nice one.
<sotha> What?
<sotha> Thanks. I'm happy I found it.
<MeteorVenture> she touched his spear
<Wockstar> well..
<sotha> Oh. I'm not watching. . . just chatting with Dashite. And then I'll go to sleep, because I neeeeeeeeeeeeed to.
<Crainy> i might replace it if i find a picture where it has applejack or pinkie pie using optimus primes jetpack
<Wockstar> TO THE INTERNETS!
<Dashite> Heh, sleep sounds like a plan.
<Thorinair> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1739027/MLP/trixierender.png
<Sidestroke> ^I approve of this Trixie
<sotha> It will make my brain happy.
<Thorinair> :D
*Sidestroke <3 Trixie
<sotha> You have XBOX?
<Balloons> Oh, hello, Darkmemories :)
<MeteorVenture> dang i really want to watch more code geass.. if they're gonna make an R3 i hope they get a move on it
<sotha> Oh really?
<Dashite> No.
<sotha> Oh. what do you play it on? Steam?
<Dashite> Yeah.
<Dashite> You on Xbox?
<Sumica> Code geass I can do.
<sotha> Yeah. Oh well then.
<Dashite> Well there goes that plan.
<Dashite> Probably should have checked that first. :/
<MeteorVenture> she's totally got a point and owned
<Sumica> Still find it odd ps3 can cross platform with pc but xbox wont.
<sotha> Yeah. Whatever. It was still fun talking with you.
<sotha> Dumb XBOX Live.
<Dashite> Yup.
<Dashite> Sumica, you mean the steamworks integration that Valve put in Portal 2?
<Sidestroke> Hi ^.^
<User_9129> o hai
<Spose> There.
<Spose> Done with cross and arrow.
<Sumica> Yes and othere games are doing it now too.
<Sidestroke> Just got back from playing TF2 for the first time in almost a month.
<Spose> now I'm sad that its over. Thats what sucks about fics. They end.
<Sidestroke> Man, I was rusty.
<Synros> <3 ps3
<Dashite> Xbox has had a few, but nothing that I can think of lately.
<Sidestroke> Had a few good games as Spy and Soldier, though
<Spose> Eh. I fell out of habit of playing TF2.
<Sumica> PSU had it with the ps2 and PC
<Spose> Mostly because the community.
<Dashite> I know Shadowrun and Universe at War both allowed cross platform play.
<SirSprinkles> 6...why am I tired? It's only 4 AM...
<Dashite> {SU?
<Dashite> PSU?
<Solo> Spose: The communiy is largely diamonds now (bronies)
<MeteorVenture> i got a PS3 but really i use it mostly for going online to watch anime anyway
<Spose> Its called TEAM Fortress 2, meaning people should play as a team.
<Sidestroke> I don't care if people yell hats the entire time
<Dashite> Sprinkles, I dunno. You're just odd I think.
<Sumica> Phanisty Star universe
<Spose> It annoys me when I have 4 people on my team that are spies/snipers
<Dashite> Oh
<MeteorVenture> those AAA games are extremely disappointing for the most part
<Spose> Dont care how good you are. Team doesn't need it.
<Sidestroke> And yeah, the lack of teamwork is annoying sometimes
<sotha> PSU?
<Sidestroke> And common sense, for that matter.
<Synros> idk Sirsprinkles, thats very strange you'd be tired at this time...very odd
<Crainy> dude
<Dashite> Look up about three messages Sotha
<sotha> What about PSU?
<Thunder_Dash> I have a PS3, thing is the disc drive doesn't work, and I have a working Wii and 360. I'm not really loyal to any games console, I just chill on the internet all the time. :P
<Sidestroke> But eh, I work on making myself better overall more than worrying about the team
<Spose> For most classes, you should never have more than 2 on your team at a time.
<MeteorVenture> me too
<sotha> Oh nevermind.
<sotha> Thanks Dashite :p
<Sidestroke> Once I get actually *REALLY* good at a class, I might consider joining a clan or such.
<Crainy> can someone please explain to me why im always so extremly sleepy in the morning when i go earlier to bed?!
<MeteorVenture> so i think my time with consoles is about done
<Dashite> No problem.
<Synros> woah owah, wait a seconds. did this anime just turn into Transformers?~?
<Sidestroke> How long have you been asleep?
<Spose> I used to have that Crainy.
<Spose> I'm part of the Friendship Brigade, but thats it.
<Thunder_Dash> I think it did...
<Sidestroke> ...and it might be a problem with how you sleep, usually airway passages blocked or not entirely open.
<Crainy> dunno, for about 8 hours
<Dashite> I've got a Wii for the first party nintendo games, a PS3 for the PS3/console exclusives and my PC for everything else. :)
<Sumica> That's macross for you.
<sotha> I just got XBOX because I was a minigame designer in the Halo games. But that's over for me now, so. Oh. Oblivion. I got it for that too, but I'm going to get Skyrim for the PC. Having no mod support was not very fun.
<MeteorVenture> thought this was slice of life? nah.. too much action
<Crainy> i always have the weirdest of dreams
<Crainy> like really weird stuff
<Sidestroke> Hmm. Yeah, probably more of a method of sleeping
<sotha> Well, goodnight everypony! (again)
<Crainy> i mean, REALLY weird stuff
<Sidestroke> I wish I could even dream.
<Dashite> Night Sotha
<Thunder_Dash> Night, sotha
<Sumica> Night Sol
<Spose> Anyone here dreamed of ponies before?
<Sidestroke> But then again, i haven't slept for more than four hours consecutive for a few weeks now.
<Sidestroke> 9.9
<Spose> Whenever I spend a night on ponies, I always dream about Scrubs for some reason.
<Dashite> -_-
<Dashite> Should have booted you when I had the chance... >_>
<Fireant> its me again!
<Synros> so many missiles. its like a micheal bay movie
<Synros> nighty nite Sotha
<Spose> &Fireant
<Spose> :P
<MeteorVenture> ya i got oblivion for the PS3.. it was cool but people saying the game is open or deep really don't know what they're talking about
<Sumica> Macross Missile mayhem is a TVtrope.
<Lysiria> Geekshed, why do you blow up my client
<Spose> I have college today. Should probably sleep.
<Crainy> sometime ago, i dreamed that i would shot the thing from blairwitch project in the face, with a grenade launcher
<Thunder_Dash> Wait, the ending theme is in French?
<Thunder_Dash> Wasn't expecting that.
<Sumica> so how about macross 2 generations later?
<Synros> best ganme I have for PS3 is MGS4
<Synros> game*
<MeteorVenture> can't spell macross without macro
<Crainy> the weird thing is, i havent seen that movie in years
*Dashite looks around for Ghosties.
<Spose> "Sorry I'm late teacher. I spent all night reading My Little Pony fanfiction. You know how it is."
<Dashite> No ghosties
<Dashite> MGS4 was horrible!
<Synros> i just like the visuals
<MeteorVenture> i got MGS4 cause mom found it at a pawn shop for $20.. no scratches or anything
<Fireant> And teacher would reply
<Synros> it was more of a moviue then vg
<Dashite> MGS4 has no gaemz!
<Solo> If it's an English professor, they just might buy that.
<MeteorVenture> good deal
<Fireant> "Oh sure, I did the same but wake up earlier to clop to ponies"
<Synros> arghr I hate this laptops keyboard
<Dashite> I bought a LE copy for $10 from Walmart on clearance. >_>
<Crainy> i would never ever clop to ponies
<Spose> "You too?!"
<Solo> Fireant: ....and that explains so much about your upbringing.
<Dashite> They had like 12 of them on the shelf.
<Sidestroke> Heh.
<Synros> I liked Mirrors Edge
<MeteorVenture> i wasn't planning on getting it but it was so cheap that we decided to go ahead and get it
<Dashite> Mirror's Edge was cool.
<Spose> And then we'd discuss Butterscotch Sundae.
<Dashite> I want a sequel.
<frostybrand> 0heh space colonies done right
<Spose> And why Luna is best pony.
<Sidestroke> *in EAD, not here
<Sidestroke> FTFY
<MeteorVenture> it was normally like $60 at the time
<Dashite> I also want other FPS games to include the movement abilities from Mirror's Edge.
<Synros> I got Prototype and start playing it, I was like SO AWESOME! but serious EVERY mission is the same
<MeteorVenture> still haven't beat it yet.. kinda quit on it too
<Thunder_Dash> Dashite; I LOVED Mirror's Edge
<Synros> now I hate it
<Spose> Well, nice talking to you all. I'm off to the moon to sleep!
<Sumica> So the last one takes place around 1998 this is 2058
<Spose> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Spose!
<Thunder_Dash> It was a bit short (all of like 11 levels), but IMO it was fun as hell
<Dashite> Sadly I didn't get Mirror's Edge until it was around $20, but it's definitely one of my favourite games this gen.
<Dashite> Yeah, it was short, but I've gone through it about 7 times now.
<Dashite> Totally got my money's worth.
<Synros> Thunder you can alos get all these new fan made levels online
<MeteorVenture> indie games are the only games that are moving forward
<MeteorVenture> so it seems
<Thunder_Dash> I know that custom levels are possible, I just haven't gotten around to it yet
<Dashite> It's short enough that I can usually get through it in about an afternoon so that's helped with its replayability for me..
<Thunder_Dash> I'd also try making some myself but the Unreal Editor and I don't get along too well
<Synros> theres also several achievments that you have to play through a couple times to get
<Thunder_Dash> the Steam version doesn't have achievements
<Synros> oh
<Synros> i mean PS3 version
<Thunder_Dash> Which I find disappointing D:
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, thought so
<Dashite> I was never big on achievements so it didn't bother me too much.
<MeteorVenture> anyone else here play and spiderweb software games?
<Synros> didn't know ME was on PC
<Fireant> !kill Pinkamina
<DerpyBot> I can't see Pinkamina anywhere 6_9
<Dashite> Yup, it came out a couple months late though.
<Fireant> Oh you derpy xD
<Synros> hmm
<Crainy> quiet chat is quiet
<Fireant> !muffinkiss
*DerpyBot regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches Fireant, showing her most adorable kissing face
<MeteorVenture> too obscure but.. had to ask
<Fireant> Criany You can't clop to ponies?
<Dashite> I haven't played any Spiderweb Software games, but I have heard of them.
<Sketchy_Sounds> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<MeteorVenture> they just made it onto steam
<Fireant> What are you doing here!?
<MeteorVenture> at least with avadon
<Thunder_Dash> It was released for PC in January 2009, the only real addition (that I know of at least) is Nvidia's PhysX system, which was really nice IMO
<MeteorVenture> i might buy it since it's only $10
<Dashite> Yeah, I heard Avadon just made it on and at a pretty low price compared to what it used to be.
<Thunder_Dash> I've heard of Spiderweb Software games either, but it sounds familiar
<Crainy> the day that ill clop to ponies, i will kill myself
<MeteorVenture> i remember playing exile on a shareware CD called 1000 games (or maybe it was 100)
<Dashite> :D
<Dashite> I remember those.
<MeteorVenture> bought it.. classic game from my childhood
<Dashite> I'll probably pick up Avadon at some point, just not right now. I've got too many other games on the go anyway.
<MeteorVenture> i also remember castle of the winds from that CD
<Fireant> That's sad.
<Fireant> Ponies from the show are sexy.
<^BlacklightShining> (shouldn't this be in #EquestriaAfterDark?)
<Crainy> sexy is the last thing i think of when thinking pony
<MeteorVenture> i downloaded that recently.. wanted to buy it when i was younger but didn't.. now i find out the dude who made it released it for free
<Crainy> atleast not that kind of sexy
<Gilda> Huh. What'd I miss now?
<Fireant> ^BlacklightShining, should it? :trollface:
<Crainy> anyways, have some optimus
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mXff4urtlY
<^BlacklightShining> oh…umm…
<Synros> ouch
<MeteorVenture> it's as old as mother 1 o.o
<^BlacklightShining> that is a /good question/!
<MeteorVenture> mother 1 is OLD
<Crainy> i would so love to see rainbow dash do that
<Synros> moew moew
<^BlacklightShining> I should, uuh, make it the new #EquestrianPhysics topic or something…
<MeteorVenture> oh gosh.. i know that from a gif or something
<Thunder_Dash> Oh, so THIS is what that's from
<Synros> then she flies off, and the Nayn cat song starts to play
<^BlacklightShining> although it's probably too meta…
<MeteorVenture> now i know where it's from
<Sumica> indeed
<Thunder_Dash> There's a youtube video of that playing for 10 minutes or something IIRC
<Synros> lol
<MeteorVenture> i gotta say that commercial was CHEESY
<Synros> well....
<Crainy> little fun fact: the gun firing sounds of optimus are actually in sync with the music
<Thunder_Dash> > implying commercials that aren't cheesy exist :P
<Crainy> thats some amazing sound design
<MeteorVenture> lol i know but can't a guy dream?
<Synros> i thought she was singing into a carrot
<MeteorVenture> haha you can't make me hungry this time! i just ate
<Synros> ok here comes the Micheal Bay missiles
<Thunder_Dash> True
<MrPoniator> Hey bronies
<Synros> so anime females can sing without a mic, while traveling at highspeeds in a massive stadium, and still be heard clearly by all the audience.
<MrPoniator> What's up?
<MeteorVenture> unrehearsed yet perfect form.. only on TV
<Gilda> I don't think anything's up.
<MrPoniator> That's too bad
<Synros> yup Meteor, only on TV
<MeteorVenture> although if he shouted for a formation of sorts that would be understandable
<Thunder_Dash> Victor-3? Obvious pun is obvious...
<Sumica> noting goes wrong on tv unless it's supposed to go wrong.
<MeteorVenture> something is going wrong.. only on TV
<Synros> I'm very happy for you anime, and I'll just let you finish with your explosions
<MeteorVenture> ^ just made me think of kanye being the reason why bleach is pretty much all fillers now
<Synros> ha
<MeteorVenture> although i don't watch it.. that's just what i hear
<Thunder_Dash> xD
<Sumica> it's true
<MrPoniator> Well, this place ain't Zolty enough for him?
<Fireant> So it seems.
<Fireant> Not enough zolt.
<Fireant> We must build additional zolts.
<MeteorVenture> maybe another anime will let bleach finish in its place
<MrPoniator> How does one build a zolt?
<Sumica> my space sure has alot of crap in it.
<Synros> i don't even know wat is going on anymore
<Thunder_Dash> Man, I tab out for a second and I could've sworn I heard music from Star Wars
<Fireant> With zolter of course, silly.
<MeteorVenture> lol it sure sounds like star wars
<MrPoniator> Does it involve ponies? I hope it does.
<Synros> didn't know you could hear explosions in space
<Thunder_Dash> the magic of television
<Sumica> explosions are louder in space cause there is no air to get in the way of the sound.
<Fireant> Sadly, no.
<Sumica> also constant thrust is needed for constant movement.
<Fireant> You can ride a pony to your zolter...
<MeteorVenture> biggs! wedge! use fira! i mean shoot em down we're being marked! i mean blow up the death star
<Thunder_Dash> Gotta love those robots in anime that are invincible to the military's weapons and explosives
<MeteorVenture> (not that biggs and wedge have anything to do with starfox.. but ships do)
<MrPoniator> I'll modify my zolter into a pony
<MeteorVenture> he's yelling too hard.. he's dead
<Sumica> squish
<Synros> hmm I thought because they was no air in space sound could travel very far from its source
<MeteorVenture> called it
<Sumica> duh he was a red shirt
<MeteorVenture> wololo
<Thunder_Dash> and that's why if you're on TV, you don't wear red
<MeteorVenture> that still picture reminded me of gurren lagann
<MeteorVenture> dang i so wanna watch that more
<Fireant> Crossover!
<Sumica> So you all want more?
<Fireant> Zolter Pony!
<MeteorVenture> so inspirational
<MrPoniator> Buck yeah!
<frostybrand> 0hot blooded badass jumping into a robot he shouldn't know how to use? yeah that gurren material :3
<MeteorVenture> idk you can do whatever.. i aint saying anything about what to watch
<Thunder_Dash> I don't really mind either
<Efreet> wat
<Sumica> This time frostybrand he dose know how to use it, he's at a pilot academy.
<MeteorVenture> i need to find where to watch record of lodoss war
<frostybrand> 0oh... well he needs to own faster then.
<MeteorVenture> dubbed
<Sumica> I can see if I can find it for showing
<MeteorVenture> it's really old btw
<Sumica> I know
<MeteorVenture> alright
<Thunder_Dash> Though I totally think (if you aren't tired of me rambling about it from earlier) Higurashi would be cool *hit*
<Sumica> But it's classic so it should be a snap to find.
<MeteorVenture> sure:D i've been meaning to watch it
<MrPoniator> Nothin'
<MrPoniator> Dangit, I guess I've caught some flu
<MeteorVenture> you haven't deleted paint yet?
<MeteorVenture> :P
<Synros> hey Sumica. you can't hear in space becuase they are too few atoms to carry sound
<Sumica> I havent installed my own program for it yet
<Thunder_Dash> So long as it's not Windows 7 paint, I don't see anything wrong with keeping it :P
<Sumica> yes i know Synros, go look up laws of anime.
<Synros> I just saw I mistyped wat I said before, so sry its kinda off topic now
<Crainy> mmmh
<Crainy> i hope i cant remember my minecraft password
<Crainy> and name
<MeteorVenture> in these kinds of shows if someone is yelling too hard and cursing at the enemy with guns blazing they're about to die
<Crainy> i really want to explore ponyville in minecraft
<MrPoniator> You hope you can't...?
<Sumica> and if there is no Air in space then why is there an Air&space museum?
<Crainy> remove the T
<Efreet> gg.
<Crainy> i hope i can
<Synros> ^ hmm, you maybe be onto something
<Crainy> i will visit sugarcube corner and stay there.... FOREVA
<Sumica> sucks to be the guy in that car
<MeteorVenture> her legs are probably gone
<MrPoniator> There are creepers outside and you're inside sugarcube corner, why leave?
<Synros> oh Sumica. I see its rule 4 in anime
<Azure_CoalSpark_> erro?
<Synros> now rule 2 is happening right now.
<Gilda> 'Sup.
<Sumica> which was taht again?
<Synros> Whenever someone or something jumps, is thrown, or otherwise is rendered airborne, gravity is reduced by a factor of 4.
<Crainy> minecraft needs an exclusive pony edition
<MrPoniator> Ja herro dar
<Synros> meaning you fall out of a plane you float just or of reach for anyone to grab you
<Sumica> lol, not quite. they were in space.
<MrPoniator> Surely
<Synros> just long enough to creat emotion,
<Crainy> then i would actually play that game
<MeteorVenture> hush up girly
<Sumica> "your ass is mine"
<Crainy> actually, every game needs an exclusive pony edition

<Sumica> and hopefully enough log on to stress test theservers
*Azure_CoalSpark_ dances
<Thunder_Dash> Ah. Kay, thanks
<Crainy> my guess is that pinkie secretly hides a unicron horn in her hair
<Semysane> Oooh, I didn't know there was a radio edit of Pony Swag
<Synros> ok guess noone did or cares?
<frostybrand> 0dwarf fort is more detailed.
<Crainy> thats why she is able to control the forces of the universe
<MeteorVenture> lol probably
<Crainy> aside from, you know, beeing pinkie pie
<Iks> pinkie can generate her own inprobability field
<Semysane> I liked the theory that she was an agent of Loki
<frostybrand> 0what other game can you rip off someones "phallus" and club them to death with it?
<Thunder_Dash> Synros; I completely missed that, what happened? O_o
<Semysane> His favorite trickster
<Azure_CoalSpark_> her special unicorn magic is defiling the fourth wall, and physics
<Crainy> okey dokey lokey....
<Semysane> Exactly!
<Solo> her special unicorn magic? Pretending to be an earth pony.
<Sumica> I might try recording the stream at the same time to test if it effects the stream too much.
<Crainy> that would make sense
<Solo> with reeeally good intuition.
<Semysane> In the comic I saw it, she ended by saying "Okey Dokey, Loki!"
<Semysane> Hmm
<Sumica> Sure people are gonna want s2 caps and such.
<Synros> theres an Amber Alert in BC right now
<Semysane> !link Loki

<Azure_CoalSpark_> griffins are green when there babies
<Semysane> Wow, the comments on that adorable Gilda picture are suprisingly mean-spirited
<MeteorVenture> of course they are.. and they're normal people
<Sumica> This is what the recording comes out like

<Leonon> baby eagle
<SirSprinkles> 6A still frame is perfect, but... ew.
<Leonon> actually those kind of look like Gilda
<The_fork> but the lion part
<Semysane> Aww, eaglets!
<Sumica> Cant seem to figure out how to clean it up
<Semysane> Oh god, eaglet crossed with a lion cub
<Leonon> I mean their facial expressions look like hers
<MeteorVenture> i like how spike just took what she said and instantly let go and stopped fearing for his life
<Sumica> Short of diffrent program
<SirSprinkles> 6What program you using?
<Sumica> WinTV
<Semysane> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs10/i/2006/086/9/d/Baby_griffin_by_sam241.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah...
<SirSprinkles> 6lemme check about.
<Semysane> http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2010/323/0/9/baby_griffin_by_scarletgreebo-d335jtg.jpg
<Sumica> damn thing cant even record in mkv >_<
<MeteorVenture> free willy 2
<Sumica> sad thing is this is better then when I first started trying to record.
<Leonon> Another baby griffin -> http://www.familyguyquotes.com/images/stewie.gif
<FallSilently> Haw haw haw
<SirSprinkles> 6Did you save straight from WinTV, or use another program and record over it?
<The_fork> bada bum tsh
<Semysane> http://www.instantrimshot.com
<Thunder_Dash> > Site is called AGKidZone
<Thunder_Dash> > Have Special Code "AGKIDZONE"
<MeteorVenture> i wonder if any bronies actually took a liking to strawberry shortcake
<Sumica> saved directly, just tryed using built in timed recording.
<MeteorVenture> since it was on just before MLP
<Synros> ahh Ive been siting here at Starbucks for 2 hours now. lol
<MeteorVenture> it's connect luck
<Sumica> indeed
<SirSprinkles> 6Try using another program to save the recording of the stream.
<Semysane> Ha, I just came across a quote supposedly from Moot
<Semysane> "My Little Pony is the only group to take on 4chan and win. 4chan once took on the F.B.I. and won. So you might say that My Little Pony is more powerful than the F.B.I."
<Sumica> Will have to look in to such a creature,
<Sumica> I dont have such a thing
<MeteorVenture> it's like taking connect 4 and turning all the skill of the game into luck.. genius!
<Semysane> EqD should issue M.L.P. ID badges
<Synros> PONEH!!
<MeteorVenture> now any noob can win
<Crainy> you guys wanna know how many clicks i need to convert 1 picture to the format that is accepted by our webstie?
<Crainy> *website
<Sumica> So yeah if you all know of any thing good and well not requireing me to pay =p let me know.
<MeteorVenture> watch closely.. applejack has really heavy back legs
<Sumica> I hate LQ video like this
<MeteorVenture> whenever she is shaking holding apple bloom
<Semysane> 73?
<JanusII> I'd gladly flash an MLP badge at people.
<Crainy> i need 9 clicks
<Azure_CoalSpark_> is reading of mares and magick....automatically reads trixies lines in her voice without noticing 0.o
<Sketchy_Sounds> THE GRRRREAT AND POWERFUL TRRRRIXIIIIIE!
<Synros> hereeeee we go!
<Thorinair> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1739027/MLP/trixierender.png
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pardon me.
<Thunder_Dash> Heeere we go...
<MeteorVenture> see?
<Azure_CoalSpark_> DAMN YOU SKETCHY...and you are excused
<Synros> food not on table....food on table
<The_fork> never !
<Thunder_Dash> Never noticed that before @Meteor
<Synros> all within 2 seconds
<Sumica> some one watched bloopers are forever.
<Synros> wat?
<Semysane> Wow, Trixie's voice actress once played Mary
<MeteorVenture> actually i noticed what i mentioned myself
<Semysane> As in, Jesus' mom, Mary
<FallSilently> Mornin' Sketchy.
<MeteorVenture> but the food i saw on pictures
<Thorinair> lol
<Sumica> hour long YT movie with all kinds of mistakes
<Thorinair> THE GREAT AND POWERFUL MARY
<Semysane> Slightly different characters there
<MeteorVenture> or something
<Synros> ijust noticed that now
<Crainy> what would i do to live in equestria
<Synros> from the under the leg shot
<Semysane> Is this like a "what would you do for a Klondike Bar" kinda thing?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Holas Fall
<Leonon> would you build equestria to live there?
<MeteorVenture> good gracious! i can count to books!
<Sketchy_Sounds> I've been here since ~5am
<Sumica> Like pointing out the inner thigh cuty marks.
<Thunder_Dash> and AJ's freckles going missing
<JanusII> Mary had to deal with plenty of neighsayers.
<FallSilently> You said you were going to bed!
<Sumica> where they just copy paste the legs so you see a mark on the inside.
<Sumica> yeah
<Synros> ive noticed that Scootaloo doesn't have wings in several scenes
<Crainy> i would probably help photofinish to make da magics
<Efreet> http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=kH2 anypony want to pass the time with this? ;o
<Synros> kinda an obvious mistake to miss
<The_fork> build ? its hard to belive such buldings can stand
<Sumica> any who
<Sketchy_Sounds> I went to bed
<Sketchy_Sounds> I slept
<Sketchy_Sounds> Then I came back to the internet for more pony.
<MeteorVenture> foreshadowing
<Thunder_Dash> Same thing happens to RD in Ep5, though it's a lot more obvious there
*Efreet waits to see if anypony joins his game :c
<FallSilently> Fail. Normalness fail.
<Crainy> ok guys
<Semysane> Why does this game want to know which way I swing?
<Crainy> lets talk about our weirdest dreams
<Crainy> who wants to start?
<FallSilently> Does yours involve ponies?
<Efreet> It's to do with some of the events, Semysane.
<Semysane> Ah
<Sumica> That's it for me. Thanks for putting up with some of the poor slections and such ^_^
<Semysane> I was afraid you were trying to rape me
<Crainy> if my dreams involve ponies?
<Crainy> im not sure
<Crainy> dont remember the dreams i had in the last days
<Synros> hmm
<MeteorVenture> i was hyped up to play earthbound 1 while playing earthbound zero.. now that i beat zero i'm just sitting here watching a stream.. what and why?
<Thunder_Dash> Ah, I was wondering why the stream was offline :P
<Crainy> however, im pretty sure i had a dream some time ago involving luna
<Semysane> I tend to remember dreams clearly for no more than like an hour
<Sumica> probably will show more tomarrow after the hub goes to junk programing.
<Synros> that was weird
*Efreet waits for somepony else to join his game
<Efreet> ;-;
<Semysane> SOmetimes I can pull on a thread I remember and recall the whole thing
<Crainy> however, the dreams that dont involve ponies are even weirder for me
<Balloons> My dreams involve IRC. can't get any weirder then that.
<Semysane> I think I've had dreams involving getting caught watching MLP, lol
<The_fork> dreams..mmm i saw a dog eating a fetus or something
<JanusII> I've never dreamed of ponies.
<Leonon> I had a dream where Season 2 introduced a new character and she was a mary sue and the entire show was about her and the opening song was all about how great she was
<MeteorVenture> also martha speaks is awesome. agreed? y/n
<Semysane> Someone join this damn game so I can find out what the hell it is!
<FallSilently> That's called Season 1.
<Efreet> http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=kH2 anypony want to join in? .-.
<Semysane> http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=kH2
<JanusII> Though I did have a weird dream last night where I was acting, and I was doing light saber duel choreography.
<MeteorVenture> thanks for the stream btw:D
<Crainy> well
<Crainy> i had a dream
<Semysane> FallSilently: LOL
<Thunder_Dash> Thanks for streaming
<Crainy> where i was chased by the thing from blairwitch project
<Synros> tank you
<Balloons> Efreet, is it chess? Because i would take on anypony if it were chess :)
<Semysane> I have a lot of dreams where I wind up wandering around somewhere naked
<Semysane> Typically mortified
<Efreet> It's not chess. It's a boardgame-esque thing.
<Crainy> the dream ended with me beeing part of a military squad blowing the things face off
<Efreet> You roll dice. Get random events. Etc.
<Semysane> sweeet
<Efreet> it's simple and fun.
<Efreet> Passes the time great too.
<Semysane> 3 players now!
<Semysane> squee!
<Efreet> Gonna start it up in a moment.
<Synros> ok, now wat do we talk about?
<Synros> topics anyone/?
<Efreet> So if you're gonna join. Join while you can, if not, you'll be observing.
<MeteorVenture> video games
<Crainy> oh
<Semysane> yay
<Synros> already done
<Crainy> i remember, i had a really freaky dream some time ago
<Crainy> and it involved a pony...
<Synros> but...
<Azure_CoalSpark_> alright every pony, I g2g, work in a few hours *yawns*
<MeteorVenture> well do it again!
<Crainy> however, it was before i knew MLP
<MeteorVenture> (in sandy's voice)
<Semysane> Night Azure
<Crainy> but it involved alot of dead bodies, zombies and whatnot
<Azure_CoalSpark_> Night all
<Crainy> and a pony got eaten by a giant snake
<Synros> Minesweeper is best game period.
<MeteorVenture> spongebob isn't in my video games
<MeteorVenture> well play again!
<Semysane> Sounds like something Phelous would review
<Synros> how did Spongebob get into this?
<Azure_CoalSpark_> <3 phelous
<MeteorVenture> by way of appliable reference
<Crainy> well
<Crainy> it was a really scary dream
<Crainy> i think it was a vision of cupcakes
<Crainy> actually, it wasnt
<Synros> well Im not sure? but remember that guy who did that thing a couple days ago?
<Crainy> i know the basic theme of the dream: we were chasing a werewolf
<The_fork> so what was it ?
<Azure_CoalSpark_> i was gonna say that sounds nothing like cupcakes
<Synros> yeah, he was awesome
<Sumica> Ah so the animes that derped out the sound early i fixed the issue for them.
<Synros> you like Mocha you say? well I prefer black coffee
<Balloons> Visions of cupcakes? oh my, that is strange.
<Crainy> oh fuck, and there was a part where we are in the woods, everything is dark and everything is filled with dead corpses, dead children, toys and even a dead burger king that grabbed my foot
<MeteorVenture> minesweeper is alright.. but it could do with a little more action.. what if they made a game where you had to fight people in those rooms in minesweeper and you had to make it to the other side of the board?
<Sumica> So might show "Railgun" and "index" today
<Crainy> and there were houses filled with dead bodies
<Crainy> and a town full of zombies
<MeteorVenture> whichever block you stepped on could kill you or you could progress.. you have to think about it while fighting
<Crainy> the dream ended with me getting pissed and grabbing a weapon from one of the zombie guards
<Synros> oh so Spider Solitare is more ur style then?
<MeteorVenture> idk why you might think that but ya i kinda liked it.. i don't usually do card games anyway
<MeteorVenture> but i find poker interesting
<Crainy> am i going crazy?
<The_fork> nope
<Balloons> Word of advice, Crainy; Stop watching whatever you're watching.
<Sumica> Night all
<Synros> lol...isn't it obvious MV?
<Thunder_Dash> Night Sumica
<Synros> I'm a wizard....
<Synros> nite Sumica
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Crainy> m not watching anything like that
<MeteorVenture> goodnight sumica!
<Crainy> *im
<Crainy> thats the weird thing
<Dumori> Night Sumica
<Synros> actually im more of a mage then a wizard
<Balloons> You're not? Eh, then i have no clue.
<The_fork> stooop eating what you eat ?
<MeteorVenture> inb4 you get to the other side of the minesweeper board and then "king me"
<Crainy> cupcakes?
<The_fork> stop sleeping
<MeteorVenture> which later you have to destroy the character you built up cause he is king now
<MeteorVenture> cause you know someone was gonna bring it up
<Crainy> that sounds like a great idea
<MeteorVenture> then your new character becomes king and all that
<Synros> right...
<Crainy> you know the weirdest part?
<Sockwear_Moon> I was going to sleep three hours ago, but then I started a fic and now I can't stop. D:
<Synros> checker sweeper
<Balloons> Watch all the Friendship is magic episodes, ten thousand times. That should clear your mind.
<Crainy> despite that i think these dreams are kind of freaky.. i think they are kind of awesome, too
<MeteorVenture> chesser sweeper
<Crainy> im a big fan of freaky things
<Crainy> as you might have already noticed
<MeteorVenture> chesser sweeper the FPS
<Crainy> you wanna know what happened to me as a child?
<Synros> with NUKES
<MeteorVenture> part FPS part RPG part RTS
<Synros> all connect to your brain and nerve system.
<Synros> done lose...
<Synros> don't
<MeteorVenture> that's why i'm thinking of being an indie game developer.. cause that way i could make that sort of thing if i wanted to
<Synros> nice, well go for it
<MeteorVenture> not innovative enough.. need more!
<MeteorVenture> moooore!
<FallSilently> ....long story short, now you're always smiling.
<Sketchy_Sounds> <Joker> You wanna know how I got these scars?
<Crainy> lawl
<Crainy> its true, i smile alot
<MeteorVenture> also i'm not entirely sure i used innovative right
<Synros> nope
<Crainy> words of wisdom: "nothing is so bad that its not good for something"
<Synros> just do it.
<MeteorVenture> nickname: nike
<Synros> like me with voice acting. took me a which, but I'm finally getting into it
<MeteorVenture> but this stuff requires planning.. you can't just jump in and hope to be successful.. you gotta know stuff
<Synros> practice practice
<MeteorVenture> that as well
<Synros> your never going to get good at it if there is no trail and error
<Crainy> quiet chat is quiet
<Synros> its not like your first game is going to decide the fate of ur career
<Crainy> quiet chat is still quiet
<Synros> Im also getting into filmmaking. its something Ive always thought was cool, but didn't do it becuase I didn't haev the right stuff. hell just use a shitty camera and windows movie maker if you have too, its the story and the way its presented is wat counts
<MeteorVenture> ya.. i don't really see how i could possibly be unsuccessful with proper effort
<Sketchy_Sounds> poniesponiesponies
<Balloons> Spooky~
<MeteorVenture> ya but quality is also very important
<Synros> hell I ever went to university for filmmakign and acting
<FallSilently> SWAG
<MeteorVenture> if you can have it you should work for it
<Crainy> ponies fucking own.. and anyone who thinks they dont should kill themselves
<Synros> voice acting is just something new, but I've bought books and stuff on it, and going to give that a try
<Shaico> I think somepony here talks too much.
<Shaico> :p
<Balloons> Now now, that's not the message we want to portray, Crainy.
<MeteorVenture> right now i'm wondering whether i should go to college or not
<Crainy> that was a line from the song
<Synros> i mean take Minecraft for example. everyone thought that game wasn't going to go anywhere. the graphics are terrible, but it was the concept that grabbed people
<Balloons> Not a very nice song then, if i do say so myself.
<Dumori> graphics are fuck all of a game
<Dumori> its astheics and gameplay
<MeteorVenture> it could be a great thing.. but man i hate my time to be so restricted by unneccesary stuff.. i wouldn't be going to graduate.. just to learn what i need to know
<Synros> well if you want to go to school for it, research alot on it, and maybe see if you can sit in on a class or something to see if you like it
<Thunder_Dash> I wouldn't say the graphics in MC are terrible, I mean the game doesn't look awful but it's obviously low-res
<Crainy> Sketchy started it...
<Dumori> yeah but it's atheticly soild
<Synros> I just said that Dumori, its the concept of the game
<Sketchy_Sounds> All I said was
<Dumori> you see that you think minecraft this square nature fits how the manacics work
<Sketchy_Sounds> poniesponiesponies
<MeteorVenture> i actually really enjoy some of the sights in minecraft
<MeteorVenture> you know why? cause it's not fake
<Leonon> I hope there's a Roc in season 2, that would make for some interresting jokes
<MeteorVenture> you can go there.. it's not a cheap background
<MeteorVenture> it's actually real
<Colgate> ponies? we don't want no ponies in this channel
<MeteorVenture> that sort of thing
<MeteorVenture> and also it looks good
<Thunder_Dash> yeah
<MrPoniator> How absurd!
<Mason_Trowel> Leonon: "Dumb Roc!"
<MrPoniator> Rock bird?
<MrPoniator> roc*
<Leonon> yes, giant bird Roc
<MeteorVenture> anyway games are all about the gameplay.. graphics come second at best.. real life has better graphics anyway
<MeteorVenture> but uglier characters
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<MeteorVenture> generally speaking
<MeteorVenture> anyway there should be more 2D games.. they can work on gameplay much more if they don't have to worry about the 3rd dimension and everything will probably look better anyway
<Crainy> lets sing some songs?
<MeteorVenture> then again super mario 64 got it right
<Leonon> I waonna Roc!
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: On A Cross And Arrow (Update Part 10!) (http://tinyurl.com/64wasnq)
<Iks> OMFG!!!!!
<MrPoniator> Holy fuck yes
<Leonon> that was posted a while ago, he just fixed the link
<MrPoniator> And sorry for profanity
<MrPoniator> Oh, well, still, YAY
<Iks> btw question to the english people here... i dont get the meaning behind the title "On A Cross And Arrow"
<Thunder_Dash> Sonic Colors looked pretty nice, and it's one of the best 3D Sonic games to date (IMO)
<Iks> if there even is a meaning
<Leonon> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HeteroSym-pinkblue2.svg
<MeteorVenture> i don't think i've even heard of that ever
<Colgate> I don't get it either
<MrPoniator> I don't get the meaning behind it either, but it doesn't bother me
<MrPoniator> Some poetic name or so forth
<Leonon> I linked to the meaning to it
<Mason_Trowel> The cross symbol is the "female" designation, while the arrow is the "male" designation
<MrPoniator> oh
<MeteorVenture> i've played sonic 1 and 2 though.. 2 was great.. 1 was ok
<PinkDeadpool> hey bronies
<Colgate> that's... stretching it imo
<Synros> well im out for a bit guys, cya in a few
<PinkDeadpool> what we talking about?
<MrPoniator> Well, I guess that makes sense
<MeteorVenture> i mean it's painfully obvious what you can't do in 1 after playing 2 lol
<Leonon> ponies and sexuality
<Thunder_Dash> bye Synros
<MeteorVenture> alright take care synros
<Crainy> ...
<Synros> remember
<PinkDeadpool> riiiiiteee
<Crainy> not this again
<Thunder_Dash> I've got the entire Genesis trilogy on cartridge, actually... sitting on my desk above my computer :P
<Synros> minesweeper is best game
<Crainy> we all know there are only two types of ponies
<MeteorVenture> lol
<PinkDeadpool> Best pony and B3st P0ny
<Synros> not really actually I f**king hate it
<Crainy> pinkie pie and everyone else
<Iks> ah thanks
<MeteorVenture> but chesser sweeper is better
<Synros> died on second clicks
<Iks> its so obvious now
<PinkDeadpool> Anyways Who's your favourite pony?
<Synros> yes FPs cheeser sweeper with nukes
<Crainy> Applejack and Pinkie Pie
<MeteorVenture> lol the nukes you step on that kill you:P
<Crainy> all the other ones are equal
<Crainy> no hate
<Balloons> Has to be, Zecora.
<MeteorVenture> your foot must have high impact on that ground
<MeteorVenture> sufficient to set off a nuke when stepping on it
<MeteorVenture> ya i got all the sonics too
<MrPoniator> All wrong
<Crainy> shes a zebra
<MrPoniator> Everypony > any pony else
<MeteorVenture> i mean 1 2 and 3
<MeteorVenture> lol
<Balloons> Crainy: A what!?
<Hat> so much fanfiction to read
<Thunder_Dash> TBH I think S2 was my least favorite, actually... IDK why, it just didn't sit too well with me
<MeteorVenture> i got 3 later and didn't really get to play it.. can't remember if the game just didn't work or if it was the sega
<Crainy> i love pinkamena, too
<BlacklightShining> 'night everypony
<Crainy> gn8
<Mason_Trowel> G'night.
<MeteorVenture> how is that possible?
<Thunder_Dash> I dunno what it was, I just didn't like it as much as the first one
<Thunder_Dash> S3&K is awesome, though
<Iks> damn... i am hungry... but there is still so much pony to watch/read
<MeteorVenture> must have been the landscaping cause... the gameplay was alot better than 1
<Hat> how is everyone going in napowrimo?!
*Colgate is catching up on youtube videos
<Crainy> i pony around all day at work
<Thunder_Dash> It's been a while since I played it, actually... Should do that again some day
<MeteorVenture> i don't know.. but i don't think you could do the ball spin thingy in 1
<Thunder_Dash> yeah, the spindash wasn't in S1
<MeteorVenture> ya.. that totally made me impatient
<Thunder_Dash> I know when I was younger S2 was the first I played
<MeteorVenture> especially when the game had a huge emphasis on momentum
<Thunder_Dash> died several times in Marble Zone in S1 because there was no spindash XD
<MeteorVenture> spindash sounds like a shipping name.. inb4 "see what we can ship dash with"
<Crainy> now
<Crainy> heres a question for all of you bronies:
<Crainy> how many times...
<Crainy> does pinkie pie...
<Crainy> say "okey dokey lokey"?
<Leonon> all the times
<Thunder_Dash> haha
<Crainy> ... touche...
<Colgate> 5-6?
<Crainy> 21
<MeteorVenture> what was marble zone? i can't remember
<Crainy> i dont have a clue myself, actually
<Thunder_Dash> Second one, the ruins
<MeteorVenture> i'm thinking about flying battery zone or something when i try to think about it.. then i just thought about marble madness
<Crainy> well, i guess, then its <Optimus> Time to find out.... </Optimus>
<Shaico> Crainy.
<Colgate> most of the times she says it are in ep 25, that might be the only episode she says it tbh...
<Shaico> Again, you talk way too much.
<MeteorVenture> but.. it doesn't even look like its name
<MeteorVenture> i think i had the right music playing in my head lol
<Thunder_Dash> lol
<Shaico> 15 as well
<Thunder_Dash> also, Sonic Colors
<Thunder_Dash> http://0.tqn.com/d/nintendo/1/0/X/3/-/-/soniccolors2.jpg
<Furril> I'd like to be a three :3
<MeteorVenture> i still think sonic should have stayed 2D
<Colgate> a three?
<Thunder_Dash> yeah
<Shaico> I think he meant tea.
<Thunder_Dash> and momentum-based, IMO
<MeteorVenture> but i mean.. they don't even make terrible 3D games
<MeteorVenture> but something about them just isn't appealing
<Efreet> http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=kH3
<MeteorVenture> to me anyway
<Efreet> Join for fun etc. etc.
<Efreet> :V
<MeteorVenture> ya momentum is monumental
<Thunder_Dash> yeah XD
<MeteorVenture> gosh i'm tired lol
<Thunder_Dash> it irritates me a lot, actually - Sonic 4 was supposed to play like the Genesis games but it was more like Rush
<MeteorVenture> rush?
<Semysane> It is really, really fun
<Thunder_Dash> Sonic Rush, on DS
<Thunder_Dash> really fast-paced, boost button, etc.
<Thunder_Dash> S4 didn't have the boost, but it played more like Rush than 1, 2, or 3, for instance
<MeteorVenture> it plays like YYZ on guitar hero.. starting out with morse code and having a chokeable solo
<Semysane> Huh, Kathleen Barr has been in previous versions of MLP as well
<Semysane> She was Sweetberry
<Thunder_Dash> I don't follow, I'm not much for rhythm games lol
<MeteorVenture> YYZ is a song by rush
<Semysane> Oh wow, she was in Dragon Tales
<Semysane> My sister used to watch that all the time
<Thunder_Dash> ah
<MeteorVenture> i just had to come up with some way to put it to a video game.. and i play guitar hero alot
<MeteorVenture> it was in GH2
<MeteorVenture> the game i started on
*Gilda stands and stretches her wings.
<Thunder_Dash> I see
<Gilda> Well, I'm done here. See you guys later if I feel like it.
<Semysane> See ya
<MeteorVenture> and i think the beginning of YYZ is morse code for.. YYZ or something

<DerpyColt> tru dat
<Balloons> Well that's your opinion. I personally find the games very enjoyable.
<Efreet> Balloons should totally play Board Game Online with me :c
<Nightmare_Mooner> Opinions are like cheese.. smelly
<Lunasta> Yes, but do you know of a hero that can captain a boat AND engineer a train in only 3 generations?
<Efreet> i know a hero that can fly an air-plane, ride a boat and possibly a train..
<FallenSilent_AFK> Link never captains a boat.
<Lunasta> Wind Waker Fall.
<Efreet> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terranigma
<Nightmare_Mooner> I dont know any heros... just me and my computer of corse i saved the world a few times
<FallenSilent_AFK> Steering a single-sail sentient dinghy doesn't count as captaining.
<Nightmare_Mooner> hacking into the pentagon to nuke china IS FUN
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<Nightmare_Mooner> *herp a derp*
<Lunasta> A boat is a boat.
<Lunasta> I never said a SHIP.
<FallenSilent_AFK> Neither did I.
<FallenSilent_AFK> If anything, the Red King was the captain.
<Lunasta> KoRL was just the annoying Navi when you reached a new island.
<FallenSilent_AFK> Anyhow, I REALLY need to go AFK.
<Efreet> I wanna play Terranigma again..
<Efreet> It was fun.

<Lunasta> Exactly what I was thinking Fireant.

<Solo> Say..... Super Effective....?

<Lunasta> The bane of my computer's existence.

<NotSpike> Get some Maruchan chicken flavored ramen.
<NotSpike> Break up the noodles into small bits.
<Cesco> Or am I on to some grand conspiracy I shouldn't know about?
<Solo> Cesco: Hostmask.
<Lunasta> No, not the Chicken flavored one. Get the Cheddar Cheese oen
<NotSpike> Fill the bowl with warm water to the top of the noodles.

<NotSpike> -.-;
<MeteorVenture> good day!
<NotSpike> You're silly.
<Fireant> Solo, I take jokes because I are Smart.
<Lunasta> You really must be Fireant, because there are only 2 or 3 people sane under your command.
<Cesco> I thought you sign on, and depending on your registered username you are allotted room authority, etc. I just figured if Seth signed on he would get the top-clearance, or whatever. Couldn't he sign on with a different name with different attributes? Or are you limited to only one name/IP address?
<Lysiria> He's founder of the channel, yeah, but not geekshed

<NotSpike> Lunasta, hush yo' mouth.
<Lysiria> Unless he logs in from a different network, Seth will always be Seth if you look at his hostmask
<Luna_In_Socks> We have three mods you guys have never heard of whose full-time roles are deciphering what Fireant says.

<Colgate> seth would be recognized as long as he identifys with nickserv
<Luna_In_Socks> Let me just screw DerpyBot's memory up for you.

<Lunasta> Coz, remind me why you mods are all insane?
<Cesco> Buzzkillington can't kill my buzz. I have Roundabout by Yes playing
<Leonon> Purple rhymes with orange
<Luna_In_Socks> We don't start off insane.
<Lunasta> Is it the corruption of power or are you trained by Fireant himself?
<Luna_In_Socks> We're recruited precisely because we seem sane.
<Lordlyhour> Damn
<Luna_In_Socks> Then Fireant goes to work on us.
<Cesco> Absolute power corrupts absolutely
<Mason_Trowel> Okay, I'm off to bed, everypony
<Mason_Trowel> See y'all later.

<Dermathil> ohai all
<Luna_In_Socks> Coz, he got into the jar again.
<Lunasta> I would like them, yes. But not if it means I'd be brainwashed by you.
<Fireant> :3 You are just saying that to make me feel good.
<Colgate> you will join the herd of ops!
*Colgate does the pinkie pie hypnotize eyes
<Barry> Hi Dermathil
<Luna_In_Socks> I could use an underling. The two or three hours between me and Sketchy is too thin to really abuse.
<Lunasta> Ha! I may be insane as well, but my insanity is far too different from their class of...
<Barry> Hi WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> Hello again Barry
*Lunasta trails off as he tries to find the right word
<Fireant> :O
<Fireant> You are a elitist insane person!

<Cesco> hey Octavia - the mods are a-crazy today
<NotSpike> It was Derpybot
<Sketchy_Sounds> dat pic
<Luna_In_Socks> Octavia's more insane than any of us. She just has more class about it.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Insanely classy
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or classily insane
<Lunasta> She's crassy.
<Sketchy_Sounds> perhaps
<Cesco> quiet Luna, I'm trying to be on her good side!
<Cesco> *sobs*

<Sketchy_Sounds> Aww, she didn't madskillz it this time
<AppleDashWINS> I prefer Eb tuning, but that's guitar lol
<Lunasta> You need it to be perfectly timed with two people
<Luna_In_Socks> What would she have done if it has landed right way up...?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Not true dude. I managed it on my own earlier.

*Luna_In_Socks claps her socked hooves

<Lunasta> You know what you did. You know why I will never ever love you again.

<Lunasta> I don't fear Fireant.
<Fireant> Liar xD
<Lunasta> Octy, your defense was lowered :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> I might set a stream going once I have some coffee
<Cesco> Sketchy what sort of stream?
<Sketchy_Sounds> A live music stream
<Cesco> ah
<MeteorVenture> alright
<mook> !link tigger
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/42097
<Lunasta> I truly don't Fireant. I don't love you either.
<Octavia> did you practice at the gala?
<MeteorVenture> i guess it's about time that i turn on earthbound.. bracing for classic
<Luna_In_Socks> Speaking of live streams, we need to sort something out with the Season 2 opener for those of us stranded on the moon.
<Cesco> Lunasta, that's why Fireant lacks control
<Sketchy_Sounds> A little
<Rainbow_Dash> I have to read part 10 of On a Cross and an Arrow
<Crainy> the pony community should have an rp event in minecraft
<Rainbow_Dash> I wait for the next chapters religiously...
<Crainy> dont you think?
<Octavia> oooomigosh, i love the Kia hamster commercials.
<MeteorVenture> i don't believe it
<Sketchy_Sounds> I was about to look for something and now I can't remember what it was.
<Rainbow_Dash> What..?
<MeteorVenture> TWINKIE HOUSE!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh yeah now I remember
<MeteorVenture> (you were supposed to say "habeeb it!")
<Rainbow_Dash> Erm
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
<MeteorVenture> btw i came up with an idea about that blue light in season 2 but it's a crossover and might have spoilers to the thing that's crossing over

<Fireant> I have plenty of control!

<Cesco> I know

<Sketchy_Sounds> No
<Fireant> But messing with Lunasta is just plain fun.
<Lunasta> Solo it's 42.
<Sketchy_Sounds> My Google Calendar. I needed to check something on it.
<Solo> Lunasta: So that's what was inside the briefcase.
<Cesco> Fireant, so is quoting Machiavelli
<Solo> Just kidding. It was just an orange lightbulb. :P
<Lunasta> But wait, are there 42 lightbulbs?
<Rainbow_Dash> Hmm
<Solo> No. But there should have been
<MeteorVenture> that's what i was referencing.. also here have this

<Lunasta> I should probably actually continue what I did a few weeks ago...
<Cesco> "What is six times eight?....Arthur sighed 'well, it's a screwed up universe..."'
<RobotPinkie> omigosh
<Lunasta> You're a mean one, Fireant. You !moon us everyday!
<Lunasta> And I'll think of something else.
<NotSpike> ...
<MeteorVenture> you don't wanna know the source of that comic..... it's bad
<Ludovician> ello
*NotSpike prays for OP status from Fireant.

<Lunasta> Not mean Balloons, just insane.
<RobotPinkie> ohay Daz
<Dermathil> how are ya today?
<Solo> Lunasta, if you make Ballons cry, I swear I'll slap you.
<Lunasta> I'll figure out the words and post it.
<Ludovician> Derpybot's not too mean. She only does what Fireant tells her to.
<MeteorVenture> about as bad as that one face i'm having trouble finding
<Daz> I just answered RobotPinkie, I'm alright.
<Fireant> Well.
<Balloons> Insane? When have i ever been insane, Lunasta?
<Lunasta> Of course, Derpy's not sentient.
<Fireant> You can still vote for other Admin in incoming election!
<Dermathil> Space Marine is out since Tuesday btw.
<Fireant> Oh... Wait.
<Colgate> you take that back!
<Ludovician> how can you say such a thing?
<Fireant> :trollface:
<Dermathil> and I LOVE the multiplayer
<Daz> I've not had much time with internets lately and it looks like i won't for at least two more weeks, so i've barely been online.
<Cesco> Lunasta, I've seen Derpy go sentient
<Colgate> derpybot is a real pony
<Lunasta> Balloons. You are a mod. You are bound to be partly insane.
<Cesco> It's a scary thing
<Dermathil> ah
<RobotPinkie> aw, sorry to hear that, Daz

*Colgate somehow magically puts toothpaste on the brush right before the brushie brushie starts.
<Daz> It's fine. I also found out 2 days ago, so before latest NightlyRoundUp, that the show's aired in Spain. I don't have the channel, and after searching for a while i haven't seen anyone uploading them. : /
<Rainbow_Dash> O_O
<Rainbow_Dash> Psst
<Lunasta> Except only Ali and BitZero are the only ones I know who can actually keep that insanity in check more than 80% of the time.
<Ludovician> somehow? You're a unicorn.
<Rainbow_Dash> Lemme read, stop posting funny images for a while DX
<Luna_In_Socks> That's Colgate's special talent. That's why she has an hourglass cutie mark. Retroactive toothpase.
<Sketchy_Sounds> You're a wizard, harry
<Balloons> I apologise then, Lunasta. I mean in no way to be insane.
<Sketchy_Sounds> brb, coffee
<Ludovician> lol
<Dermathil> There's a part of Boast Buster on nightlyroundup
<Ludovician> Colgate, retroactively brush my teeth please. I forgot to brushie today.
<Colgate> sorry, my time walking powers can only go back a maximum of 5 seconds
<Ludovician> damn it
<Daz> That's what i was on about. I found out the show begun airing last thursday. I found this out 2 days ago, and now it's on EQD. Yea, i wish I could see them
<WhatPayne> Hey I'm here!
*Ludovician brushes Fireant with the toothpaste-coated brush.
<WhatPayne> Oh and hello Daz, RobotPinkie
<Cesco> Colgate, that gives new meaning to the 5-second rule
<Daz> Hi, hello
<Fireant> Well guys, its fun, but I must focus.
<Lordlyhour> Well, why don't you go back in time fiveseconds
<Ludovician> so i noticed in nightly round up (I think yesterday?) Seth said RIP socks meme. Is the socks meme over?
<Lordlyhour> and then do it again?
<Turgle> hello everypony!
<Fireant> So from now on, sensless ping on me will be bad. ;D
<Daz> Hi
<Solo> Ludovician: Not even Seth can kill a meme just by sayin so
*Luna_In_Socks furiously tackles Ludovician to the ground
<Solo> Only Lauren Faust wields such power.
<Luna_In_Socks> NEVVAH!
<Octavia> Fireant, i want to fu---- oh, sorry. i will not bother you
<FF|Class> actually, I'm gonna take the laptop with me today.

<Ludovician> LOL
<Lunasta> HEY! FIREANT! LISTEN!
<Efreet> :V
<Lordlyhour> Goddamn, that takes some skill
<FF|Class> Nah, I don't have discreet ear buds
<Ludovician> Hai, Lunavi.
<FF|Class> Mine are all hot pink.
<Lunasta> Fu...llfil her destiny to be the best double cello there is?
<Solo> FF, that was the idea
<Lysiria> She's a cello?
<Ludovician> ..double cello?
<Lunasta> Best double cello player*
<Solo> It resumes where everyone can hear it.
<Lordlyhour> basello, I thought it was?

*DerpyBot flies up in the air and does a backflip
*DerpyBot lands on her back. Ouch!
<RobotPinkie> hay WhatPayne
<Lunasta> If the fandom still can't agree if it's a double bass or cello
<Lordlyhour> Double chello puts me in mind of duel wielding intruments
<Lunasta> then just make it a double cello
<Ludovician> lol
<Lordlyhour> cello**
<MeteorVenture> alright well last one.. the source of that comic is almost as bad as the source of this face http://pds.exblog.jp/pds/1/201003/27/35/b0021035_0495824.jpg
<Efreet> Octavia, I hate to interupt you but..
<Ludovician> ill call it a piano.
<Ludovician> deal with it
<MeteorVenture> well i mean last one till you read it all lol
<Efreet> Vinyl Scratch is the best music pony of all time.
<Lordlyhour> You have to admit, Dual wielding instruments would take some skill
<Efreet> OF ALL TIME.
<WhatPayne> Feeling better RobotPinkie ?
<Shaico> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 9d:00h:47m:24s
<Lordlyhour> OMIGOD!
<Ludovician> Only Pinkie can play multiple instruments simultaneously.
<Lordlyhour> just 47 minutes left!
<Lordlyhour> until its just a 9 day wait
<RobotPinkie> much better, I think, thanks
<Octavia> Vinyl is snuggly, too
<Cesco> you made that joke yesterday, I think
<Ludovician> damn it the episode is at 11pm my time :(
<Lunasta> Dual wielding anything can be hard if you have hooves.
<Solo> Pinkie's special talent: being random.
<Efreet> Pinkie's special talent is making people happy!
<Ludovician> she should have a more random CM then
*Efreet cuddles Pinkie Pie
<Lordlyhour> DAy before, actually
<Lordlyhour> SO help me, ITS GUNNA BE A MEME!
<Cesco> The days are blurring
<Lunasta> What if instead of her cutie mark being balloons, it was Balloons?
<Efreet> what's a meme? what.
<Ludovician> .... a 9 day meme restated only by you?
<TheSonicRainboom> Tomorrow's a baking day for me! Guess what i'm making?
<Lordlyhour> ...whoa
<Efreet> Uhm.. Pie?
<TheSonicRainboom> Cupcakes!
<Lordlyhour> Pie is always good

<TheSonicRainboom> If you trying to make reference to a certain fanfic I don't want to talk about on a PG chat..
<Solo> Whoa. Now THAT ws a delayed reaction

<Lordlyhour> Okay then

<Lunasta> :P
<Balloons> Funny if on the day; The only video, Hasbro releases is a video of Celestia saying "Gotcha". Actually wait, that would be cruel.
<Rainbow_Dash> Yes, I can
<Ludovician> That would be unbearably cruel
<Solo> Balloons: Video is released where they pretend to be releasing the episode a day early to EQ Daily
<Solo> Balloons turns out it's a fake...
<Lunasta> lol
<Solo> Balloons: Then, you hear "gotcha" and the episode plays.
<Solo> DOUBLE trolling.
<Lunasta> Nah, Seth would filter it
<Lunasta> Unless he goes along with the trolling
<Ludovician> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/27561

<TheSonicRainboom> Ludovician thanks for that
<Ludovician> ?
<RobotPinkie> need to get back to class tomorrow either way
<Balloons> TheSonicRainboom: The stuff you're referring to, Helium?
<TheSonicRainboom> Correct, you won.
<RobotPinkie> but now... doctor who
<TheSonicRainboom> But in the video, it's trolling.
<Lunasta> Or hydrogen if you want it to be mildly explosive
<TheSonicRainboom> Rage = explode
<Dermathil> >mfw I read Turgle as Nurgle
<Dermathil> too much space marine...
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Lunasta> Heh, my Macbook says the word of the day is extort
<TheSonicRainboom> I also liked this Sweeny Todd parody "Pinkie Pie"
<MeteorVenture> lol alright
<RobotPinkie> Can you actually have too much space marine, Dermathil?
<Dermathil> maybe
<Dermathil> though it would be hard.
<MeteorVenture> what i really meant was if you could read what i said up there cause when you log off and log back in it's all gone

<Dermathil> Multiplayer is SOO MUCH FUN
<RobotPinkie> might have to try it out
<Lunasta> Young Bender? Why the hell is that in Derpy's brain?
<TheSonicRainboom> When I was a little filly and the sun was going dooooown
<MeteorVenture> but then when i shortened it so much you were pretty much doomed any way you answered if you actually couldn't see that stuff
<Dermathil> also, the customization stuff is extremely fun too
<TheSonicRainboom> The darkness and the shadows they would always make me frooooown
<Solo> Hmm.
<mexican> hello, just passing by to check on my bronies
<Rainbow_Dash> I see
*Ludovician gives mexican a muffin.

<Solo> Nice. I've been on this IRC channel for 13 hours technically.
<mexican> thx Ludovician
<Dermathil> lvl 21 I think I am and I chose what parts I would want to put on my armor.
<Lordlyhour> Cue the universe ending as well all realise that
<Lordlyhour> AAAND roll credits
<MeteorVenture> if you said yes but couldn't see what i said then that's that.. but if you said no there's a much more obvious problem
<Ludovician> We apologise for the inconvenience.
<Cesco> ^good reference
<Ludovician> Thank you.
<mexican> what are we talking about?
<Turgle> Nurgle xD
<Cesco> 42
<Solo> "you are all figments of a greater being's imagination. Sorry for the inconvenience. Have a nice day."
<Ludovician> if u didn't get the reference, go drink several pan-galactic gargle blasters, pass out in a time capsule, eat at the restaurant at the end of the universe and still find time to brushie Colgate.
<Ludovician> and then ill tell you
<Ludovician> :)
<Lordlyhour> Heh
*Lunasta cues the Simpsons couch gag
<Lordlyhour> Does anyone here celbrate towel day?

<Balloons> Ok, be right back.
<Ludovician> huh?
<Turgle> I do!
<Ludovician> Well, the first ten million years were the worst...
<Dermathil> The multiplayer could go with a few more maps/gamemodes though
<Ludovician> The second ten million... they were the worst too.
<Lordlyhour> Awesome
<mexican> lol
<Ludovician> After that, things went into a bit of a decline.
<Lordlyhour> Maybe we can see about turning it into an EQ daily event?
<Ludovician> towel day?
<Lordlyhour> Pony towels
<Turgle> that would be great :D
<Lordlyhour> Towel day
<mexican> wet towels or dry ones?
<Lordlyhour> Celebrate Douglas Adams Birthday
<Ludovician> But how many towels must I bring?
<Lordlyhour> by taking a towel with you everywhere
<Turgle> uhm
<Lunasta> Celebrate Day Day?
<Cesco> It shows that you're always ready
<Lordlyhour> No
<Ludovician> The #1 rule of hitch hiking is to always make sure you have your towel with you
<Ludovician> no matter what
<Barry> I wonder how chapter 11 will conclude On a Cross and Arrow
<Turgle> and
<Turgle> don't panic
<Lordlyhour> It gves you the appearance of always being readyu
<mexican> true
<mexican> i forgot about that
<Cesco> I just said that
<Colgate> so... many... hitchhiker's guide references
<Ludovician> I like panic. Panic is my favourite!
<Lordlyhour> and allows you to scab anything you want from non-hitchhikers by making them you assume you lost it
<mexican> long since i saw the movie, longer since the book
<Lunasta> Oh god. Towels just reminded me that it's gonna be at least 41 C today...
<Barry> I just read chapter 10
<Turgle> :I
<Lordlyhour> ...
<Ludovician> mexican... you saw the movie since the last time you read the book?
<Cesco> HA C temperatures
<Lordlyhour> your train of though must be similar to mine
<Ludovician> YOU ARE STILL TAINTED. Go read it again to remove the filth of the movie from your mind.
<Cesco> Lunasta where do you live, a desert?
<mexican> hmmm no, first the book
<mexican> then the movie
<Dermathil> no idea, didn't start reading it yet
<Lunasta> So Cal Cesco
<mexican> both long ago
<Ludovician> read what I said
<Ludovician> lol
<Cesco> So.... a desert?
<Lunasta> Pretty much
<Lordlyhour> Pinkie lives in a dessert
<Ludovician> Indeed she does
<Ludovician> but it doesnt help that she eats it regularly.
<Lunasta> Desserts live in Pinkie Pie
<Cesco> this is 'Merica, we use Farenheight (sp?) here!
<TheSonicRainboom> The thought of having "100 degrees" is scary to someone with Celcius
<TheSonicRainboom> Like myself
<Lunasta> Screw the imperial system! I'm preserving my knowledge of the rest of the world!
<mexican> indeed
<Ludovician> Fahrenheit
<mexican> celcius
<Cesco> 100 C is boiling, isn't it?
<Colgate> yes
<mexican> at sea level yes
<Cesco> We should just use Kelvin
<Lunasta> Actually, if I really wanted to be anal, I could go for Kelvin XD
<Cesco> HA
<Cesco> Herd-think
*Lunasta brohoofs Cesco
<mexican> we need kelvin degrees below 0
<Cesco> I don't know whether to feel awesome or incredibly nerdy right now...

<MrPoniator> Hey guys
<Crainy> YOU DO THE PONEY POKEY
<WhatPayne> ... But I was only assuming that because if something in youtube is blocked, it's only for people outside USA
<Ludovician> COME OUT
<Zephirdd> from some people, I think Brazil's geography schooling is better than US >_>'
<Zephirdd> haha
<Colson> hauu~
<MrPoniator> And that's what I'm talking about~
<Zephirdd> it actually blocks per country, not from outside a country
<Zephirdd> I believe Germany has a lot of blocked vids too
<Zephirdd> :\
<Ludovician> This is your singing telegram, I hope it finds you well
<Balloons> Even though your dates a lout.
<Ludovician> You're invited to a PARTY and it's gonna be really swell
<Crainy> gummys turning one year old so help us celebrate
<Ludovician> Damn, I can't remember the lyrics with Night of Pony playing in the background
<WhatPayne> Yeah, but my point is that I don't think US Americans get to see that screen too often in Youtube.
<Colson> Gummy is a year old?
<Ludovician> yep
*Colson hugs Gummy
<Ludovician> Gummy's officially a party animal
<Zephirdd> I don't think they see it at all
<Zephirdd> well, Brazil doesn't at least
<Zephirdd> since there is no legislation about it or whatsoever
<Ludovician> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehffsSzBI5E
<WhatPayne> That must be nice.
<Zephirdd> well, we still can't see copyrighted stuff tho :P

<WhatPayne> That's the other one I got blocked from

<User_3215> LET US DISCUSS; immortality in a ponyverse that does not do away with death.
<Efreet> Ponies don't die..
<Efreet> They get recoloured.

<WhatPayne> which link is that?
<Zephirdd> electric feel cover MGMT
<Nashy> Immortality does do away with death, per definition...
<WhatPayne> Oh, yup still Blocked.
<User_3215> I refer to the ever so common idea of Celestia and Luna outliving everypony else
<Efreet> But Ponies don't die.. they just get recycled and recoloured!
<Colson> lol
<Colson> ^
<Turgle> lol
<Turgle> that's probably true
<Rodman> Nopony here?
<RobotPinkie> wow... why would that be blocked?
<`Michael89pl> all of the creatures in Everfree Forest are bulletproof?
<RobotPinkie> hay Rodman
<Turgle> no 'cuz no guns there
<Zephirdd> dont know either
<Zephirdd> =/

<WhatPayne> The show has been on like forever, and I don't know where I would even begin.
<RobotPinkie> just watch the new ones, eccleston and after

<RobotPinkie> yeah, I've seen a couple of lets plays start on YT

<Balloons> Crainy? are you ok?
<Crainy> THIS IS ALL HER FAULT
<Rodman> So, September 17th
<Efreet> Played by ponies.
<Rodman> Besides watching MLP S2, how will you celebrate?
<Efreet> Desktop Ponies are so <3
<bicyclerepairman> yeah :D
<Iks> crainy is brainwashing himself with that long cupcakes song since a couple of days
<Nashy> Desktop ponies?
<bicyclerepairman> shame they only run on my good pc
<Crainy> Balloons: No
<Balloons> Oh, ok. Just checking.
<bicyclerepairman> desktop ponies! http://desktopponies.co.cc/
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Soarin' are the players for Team Luna, with Applejack as their goalie. Spitfire, Rainbow Dash and Twilight are Team Celestia, with Fluttershy as their goalie.
<Efreet> Celestia is winning by 2.
<Efreet> Now by 1.
<Efreet> Now by 2 again.
<Efreet> Now by 1 again. This match is exciting!
<Nashy> Thanks for the play-by-play.
<Efreet> It's currently a draw at 6 all.. But Team Celestia kicks a goal!
<Efreet> no problems.
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts I'm about to start streaming here
<Balloons> Efreet, what are you doing?
<Efreet> Team Celestia is ahead by 2. Now by 3!
<Crainy> what song are you going to do first?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Probably Cupcakes
<Efreet> I'm giving you all an update on the hoofball game I have on my desktop, played by Desktop ponies!
<Nashy> Fluttershy would be worst goalie ever.
<Crainy> you mean "something broke"?
<WhatPayne> hm... I've been playing with two ideas in regards of fanart.
<Iks> first
<Crainy> or the actual cupcakes song?
<Efreet> Team Celestia won, by 4!
<Sketchy_Sounds> The actual Cupcakes from Call of the Cutie
<WhatPayne> But I don't know/think I'll manage either of them by 17th
<Crainy> mmmh boring
<Crainy> actually, its not
<Crainy> i love that song, too
<Balloons> You sing? Awesome.
<Efreet> Pinkamena v Pinkie Pie in Ping Pong. Oh boy.
<Crainy> in ping pong?
<Efreet> Yup
<Crainy> that should be interesting
<Crainy> where can i watch?
<Crainy> Pinkie will win, btw
<Efreet> On my desktop. :V
<Sketchy_Sounds> I just linked
<IAmAmirul> Helloo

<Crainy> im at work
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:23h:03m:38s
<Efreet> Pinkamena's winning by 3. Come on Pinkie.
<Crainy> lol
<WhatPayne> They are pretty awesome ideas tho... So it's quite shame. :/
<Crainy> pinamena could never beat pinkie
<Crainy> pinkie is the superior personality
<Efreet> Pinkamena's flogging Pinkie by 4. :V
<Efreet> 5 now.
<Efreet> Make that 6.
<Crainy> what have i done.... party of one...
<Iks> im gonna go hunt me some pie
<Crainy> i would love to spam some more lyrics, but i think i would get to visit the moon...
<Crainy> again
<Balloons> Yes, spamming will get you kicked.
<Crainy> which is why im not doing it....
<Efreet> So. Balloons. As a bunch of balloons, do you have a fear of pins and sharp objects?
<Crainy> he has a fear of gilda
<Balloons> If you want to know, my name is based off, Pinkie's cutie mark. Not the actual Balloons.
<Efreet> I guessed that. I just felt like being a punny kind of guy.
<Efreet> ;D
<Balloons> No worries.
<Iks> i wonder who else is listening to sketchy besides me
<NightmareMoon> Pokey Pierce used to do more than pop balloons, but after a stink in prison and becoming a Registered Sex Offender, he found it to be much more legal.
<NightmareMoon> stint*
<Nashy> damn these ponies are really intrusive :P
<Dermathil> Both Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies will be streamed at the time of the robot night saturday show.
<Dermathil> on the 17th
<Crainy> what are you talking about, Nightmare?....
<BitZero> Not going to ask.
<BitZero> Anyway, I go.

<eXAKR> Hmmm.
<eXAKR> It's funny, in a cruel way, to me
<eXAKR> I mean, WTF
<eXAKR> Balloon phobia?
<Sketchy_Sounds> About to have another shot at Art Of The Dress
<eXAKR> Then again I have a cockroach phobia
<eXAKR> and I know how it feels like when people laugh at me for this
<eXAKR> >>
<Balloons> People have phobias of everything.
<bicyclerepairman> i'm afraid of phobias D:

<MeteorVenture> season 2.. i figured out what the blue glow is (and i saw someone else mention it too but i didn't know what they meant until i was searching for something related to yet-to-be-said discovery and found out what they meant)
<RobotPinkie> Someone's going to be making a ton of money
<WhatPayne> Slightly too furry to my taste
<Rainbow_Dash> To bad its one of a kind, would be nice to have one
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<MeteorVenture> Cherenkov radiation (also spelled Cerenkov or Čerenkov) is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. The charged particles polarize the molecules of that medium, which then turn back rapidly to their ground state
<MeteorVenture> emitting radiation in the process. The characteristic blue glow of nuclear reactors is due to Cherenkov radiation.
<Rainbow_Dash> O_O
<MeteorVenture> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Advanced_Test_Reactor.jpg
<WhatPayne> Haha, Funny thing is I have read about Cherenkov radiation before.

<Nashy> Sometimes I wonder if it's just not best to lock them in a room full of whatever they're afraid of though.
<Balloons> I know, that's just mean.
<Hayfever> Sketchy_Sounds, video went derp
<Nashy> Well, I figure they will get over it.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> I'm afraid of ponies
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> My greatest fear
<Balloons> Ponies can be very scary.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> My therapist reccomended watching Friendship is Magic to help alleviate this, by showing ponies in a non-threatening light
<bicyclerepairman> causing eternal night and all that
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Then I read some of the fanfiction, and the pony fear returned even stronger =(
<Nashy> Perhaps there are better methods, but I figure eventually, if exposed to it, you'll just stop being scared, because you can't be afraid in the long run...
<Balloons> That may be true, but sometimes the shock of exposure to said object may be dangerous.
<MeteorVenture> gosh.. those mako reactors' green glow is much more awesome now
<Nashy> My only fear is being suddenly plunged under water, but that's not really a phobia.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Some fears are good
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> I'm afraid of spiders, and of course there's no reason NOT to be afraid of spiders.
<RobotPinkie> I need to play some FF8 later...
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> I wouldn't want to condition myself to like and enjoy spiders
<eXAKR> I have a bit of fear for spiders as well
<eXAKR> Not as bad as cockroaches though
<eXAKR> long story
<Balloons> Of course. they can be dangerous but you don't need a phobia of spiders to know not to touch them.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Those are gross too
<Nashy> I'm not afraid of spiders if I know they are harmless.
<eXAKR> The large ones
<eXAKR> When they have their egg sacs
<Iks> lol sketchy
<eXAKR> And they hatch
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> I hate daddy longlegs, and I know those are harmless
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> But so creepy
<eXAKR> and the baby spiders everywhere
<eXAKR> Creepy and dangerous
<MeteorVenture> i can't remember if those were in 8.. but i know they were at least in 7
<Nashy> I hate bugs. I don't fear them.
<bicyclerepairman> get an electric fly swatter, a friend of mine had hours of fun with that
<Nashy> They're just disgusting.
<eXAKR> My home is full of spiders apparently
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Kill all bugs
<bicyclerepairman> he ran around the place and made it absolutely spider-free
<eXAKR> But most are the small and tiny harmless variety
<eXAKR> Still does bother me though
<MeteorVenture> i need to get over 1000 jumps on the jump rope minigame on FF9
<Balloons> If i see a spider, i put it on a piece of paper and carry it outside. Easy. No harm done to either of us.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> The only ones that don't bother me, pill bugs, lady bugs, grasshoppers
<eXAKR> My ceiling was once filled with baby spiders, stuff
<eXAKR> Tiny ones
<Nashy> I use duct tape.
<Crainy> to be honest
<eXAKR> Spent a whole day using a cloth and wiping them off
<eXAKR> Killing them
<Crainy> wait
<eXAKR> But argh
<Nashy> bug sticks to tape
<Crainy> what are you talking about?
*Dermathil plunges back in Space Marine multiplayer
<Crainy> killing them?
<Fireant> Crainy.
<Crainy> Fireant
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Kill spiders with socks, pieces of paper, cologne + lighter, shampoo, anything that can be used against them quickly and efficiently
<Fireant> I've just noticed your cupcake song.
<bicyclerepairman> i try to rescue them if i can
<Fireant> Don't do that again.
<Crainy> uhm.. what?
<Crainy> you listened to it?
<eXAKR> Back in my old apartment I once encountered a centipede
<Nashy> He does it all the time.
<eXAKR> My old apartment had all kinds of bugs D:
<Nashy> D_D
<Fireant> I've seen you spamming lines of it here.
<bicyclerepairman> unless they are huge idiots
<Fireant> DIE!
<Crainy> how did you like it?
<Crainy> oh
<Crainy> that
<Crainy> yeah, i already forgot about that
<bicyclerepairman> or it's very late in the evening
<eXAKR> Silverfish, roaches, spiders, flying things.
<Balloons> eXAKR: Yes, a spider egg hatching is not a good thing, for you or your house.
<Leonon> I killed thousands of ants using a lint roller
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Ants aren't that bad
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> I kill them but if one touches me it doesn't really freak me out
<Leonon> they were when I was killing thousands of them
<eXAKR> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf6_qDoCUu0 <---
<MeteorVenture> argh.. i'm just too tired to jump into earthbound.. i guess that's tomrrow
<Lysiria> It's fun following ants around the house as they walk their paths from nest to food
*Lysiria such a nerd
<eXAKR> I saw that video a while ago
<Fireant> Ants?
<eXAKR> Disgusted the Celestia out of me
<Leonon> I found a spider like that in my hause recently, no egg sack though
<Fireant> I like ants.
<RobotPinkie> mako reactors were only in 7
<bicyclerepairman> i put a wet towel on an ant street by accident
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Fireants?
<RobotPinkie> but I just played through that a couple of months ago, lolz
<bicyclerepairman> the place was swarming with ants shortly afterwards because they didn't find the way anymore
<eXAKR> There's an ant nest in my home
<eXAKR> In the kitchen
<bicyclerepairman> it was kind of funny
<Leonon> I found the spider while pouring a bucket of water into my toilet, the spider fell into the toilet while I was pouring
<eXAKR> Leave any food or anything sweet in the kitchen
<eXAKR> 5 minutes later
<eXAKR> ants everywhere
<Lysiria> SPIDERSESSSSS.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Was playing hide and seek at a family picnic when I was like 6, hid up against a rotten tree, got ants all over me and had to run around taking off my clothes in front of everyone, not fun times
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> The biting kind of ants
<eXAKR> I gave up trying to manage them and just put food in my fridge whenever possible
<eXAKR> Cereals are especially vulnerable
<Leonon> I discovered the exact point at which I will fearfully kill a spider then, if the spider is as large as my hand and in my toilet I will kill it and not feel bad
<Lysiria> Pouring cereal and seeing ants flee the bowl makes me a sad pony.
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> =(
<eXAKR> Sometimes I go into the kitchen
<eXAKR> Make some instant ramen
<Rainbow_Dash> I still havent gotten that far in 7
<eXAKR> Then later
<Rainbow_Dash> Anyway, AFK again for a little bit
<eXAKR> I find dead ants in it
<eXAKR> :/
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Ants really like nuts too, like roasted peanuts, no idea why
<Leonon> protein they use to make more ants
<Leonon> ants are like a RTS game, the rescources are water, protein, and sugar
<Lysiria> What really makes me rage is when you have a drink and ants crawl into it
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> How do they get it out of the peanuts though, not like there are any little bits, they'll swarm a whole peanut
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Can they cut into it?
<eXAKR> Lysiria › What really makes me rage is when you have a drink and ants crawl into it <- Tell it to me
<Hayfever> gala <3
<eXAKR> Also, when they swarn your half-eaten food
<Lysiria> I've drunk a few ants because of that
<Leonon> I use to get carpenter ants in my sodas
<Lysiria> they taste like... ew.
<Hayfever> Sketchy_Sounds this song makes me so happy
<Balloons> Wow, eXAKR. You appear to have a major ant infestation from what've heard.
<eXAKR> Yeah
<Lysiria> We should send Derpy to fix the problem.
<eXAKR> Like I said
<Rodman> Well, MeteorVenture has enlightened us with SCIENCE
<eXAKR> There's a nest in the kitchen
<eXAKR> In the wall
<Rodman> So now we know Celestia keeps a nuclear reactor in the palace
<eXAKR> The queen is probably in there
<Leonon> put mineral oil along the wall, they can't get across it easily
<Rodman> Which in turn shows what powers the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Cannon
<eXAKR> hmmm.
<eXAKR> I'm thinking of sealing up the holes where the nest is with something
<eXAKR> Like plaster
<eXAKR> It's a tiled wall though
<Lysiria> ...Hm... Derpy ant exterminator. Knowing her, she'd use mousetraps...
<eXAKR> lol
<Leonon> caulk the wall, put baby oil or WD40 (or another mineral oil containing thing) along the wide of the caulk
<bicyclerepairman> and the house would be cockroach-free after that :D
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Orkin
<Lysiria> Derpin
<eXAKR> You think if I spray some WD-40 into the holes
<eXAKR> What could happen?
<Balloons> The universe might implode. Nothing serious.
<Leonon> if the mineral oil gets dirty or dusty enough they can get through it
<Leonon> or if the oil absorbs into whatever it's on
<eXAKR> Hmmm.
<eXAKR> I think I will have to talk to my dad about it
<eXAKR> Probably tell him to buy some plaster or sealant or something
<Leonon> the baseboard will probably stop you from getting a good shot at the actual hole though
<mexican> sup ponies?
<Leonon> also, that "Giant Mother Garage Spider" video is horrifying
<mexican> hello?
<RobotPinkie> seems likely
<bicyclerepairman> hey mexican
<eXAKR> Yeah
<mexican> hi bicyclerepairman
<mexican> what are we talking about?
<bicyclerepairman> bugs, spiders, ants
<Balloons> The occasional pony.
<mexican> i like spiders
<Hayfever> occasionally.
<Leonon> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf6_qDoCUu0
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Giant Mother Garage Spider
<mexican> hayfever, arent you octavia?
<Hayfever> yes
<mexican> hi
<Hayfever> howdy
<mexican> not bad
<mexican> im at school
<Rainbow_Dash> Sounds legit Rodman
<mexican> going to try some robots
<Hayfever> robots do not like to be tried. they will kill you. all hail overlord robots.
<mexican> i know
<mexican> but this are trained robots
<eXAKR> Night going to bed
<bicyclerepairman> night eXAKR
<mexican> night
<mexican> well, day here
<bicyclerepairman> same here
<Rodman> On another note, the RD costume is bidding at 2.5K right now
<mexican> does any of you know how to program in c++?
<Rodman> That guy's getting a nice payday
<Colgate> <
<bicyclerepairman> ew, oop
<LunaOnTheMoon> no, but I can learn!
<Leonon> I know how to break programs in C++
<LunaOnTheMoon> That's easy Leonon
<LunaOnTheMoon> just.type.anything.
<Colgate> ^^
<bicyclerepairman> i know how to stare buggy c-programs into submission
<mexican> <<^^>>
<Leonon> I also have a theorteical degree in physics
<Colgate> anyways, mexican, what did you need?
<mexican> nothing yet, first have to program the remote
<RobotPinkie> that's some expensive yiffing right there
<mexican> the problem will come in the autonomous part
<mexican> when i get there i´ll tell you
<bicyclerepairman> i had a second degree burn once
<LunaOnTheMoon> If you have a theoretical degree in physics, we should get some magnets around Einstein.
<mexican> how do magnets work?!?!?
<bicyclerepairman> friendship
<mexican> is it because of the great and powerfull twixie?
<LunaOnTheMoon> no
<LunaOnTheMoon> Magneta, our lesser sister, ensures that magnets work
<LunaOnTheMoon> her wings are stubby and her horn magic is weak, when compared to us pure alicorns
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Trixie has no interest in magnets
<mexican> lol
<mexican> brb, gotta finish the program
<mexican> call me if something interesting happens
<User_5784> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:22h:13m:23s
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Season 2 episode leaks early
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> Contains Luna
<MeteorVenture> ^ typical furry mindset
<Colgate> who is this Luna character?
<Balloons> Is she the one with the wings?
<bicyclerepairman> a diamond dog
*Hayfever knows too much about s2 already. sigh.
<WhatPayne> Holy shiet, that thing is going up like rocket...
<Crainy> seems like we have 20 lunas here in the chat...
<LunaOnTheMoon> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:22h:10m:40s
<Crainy> luna in socks, luna on the moon, luna, nighmare moon....
<bicyclerepairman> there's going to be ponies in s2?
<Balloons> Nah, only horses.
<WhatPayne> Already at 3000
<Hayfever> s2 is all humans
<Colgate> I was hoping for an all sea serpent episode
<Crainy> i think i will rename myself into luna in sugarcube corner
<johnsey|AFK> i thought s2 is only sea ponies
<bicyclerepairman> hell, i'd still watch it
<Crainy> bad troll is bad
<RobotPinkie> what's typical furry mindset?
<Crainy> so anyways
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> All Zebra spinoff, Zecora Show
<Crainy> im driving home now
<johnsey|workmode> shoo be doo
<Crainy> see you there
<Crainy> bye
<bicyclerepairman> shoob shoob be doo
<Cesco> what I have I stumbled into... not that sea pony nonsense again?
<bicyclerepairman> nonsense? :O
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Call Upon The Sea Ponies

<WhatPayne> IDK
<mexican> !link equestria girls
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/27809
<MeteorVenture> exactly what you said
<RobotPinkie> lol, neigha be trollan
<Rodman> Expensive yiffin? Is that the mindset you mean?
<MeteorVenture> ya
<RobotPinkie> or well, at least I hope you're trolling
<MeteorVenture> nah not all furries are like that.. just typically lol
<RobotPinkie> lol, oh wow.
<MeteorVenture> you do know what yiffing even is right robot?
<Octavia|Music> at the gala o/~
<RobotPinkie> Yes, otherwise the joke wouldn't really work.
<Colgate> at the bed
<Colson> Shotguns are wonderful for blowing faces off in Borderlands
<Rodman> 3.5K now
<MeteorVenture> unless you thought it meant something else that would work
<RobotPinkie> lol, it's going up quickly
<mexican> i leave for 3 min and the chat dies
<Balloons> At the gala, with princess, is where i'm going to be.
<bicyclerepairman> see what you did? i sure hope you're happy
<Rainbow_Dash> 3.5k now?
<Balloons> We will talk all about magic, and what i've learned and seen.
*LunaOnTheMoon wants to go to the gala...but Celestia said no
<Balloons> It's going to be so special, as she takes time just for me!
<WhatPayne> And still four days until auction closes
<bicyclerepairman> she doesn't want to cover the travel costs
<mexican> been dreaming, i´ve been waiting, to fly with those great ponies
<RobotPinkie> If you want an argument, MeteorVenture, I'd suggest 4chan.
<Rainbow_Dash> I bet it will make it to 10k
<bicyclerepairman> because it would be an official visit. now imagine what a pegasus limousine must cost
<MeteorVenture> i'm not looking to argue
<bicyclerepairman> now imagine it going to the moon!
<WhatPayne> I reckon that with three and half grand you'd be able to hire someone to make this kind of costume to you.
<bicyclerepairman> see? you'd ruin all of equestria!
<mexican> the wonderbolts, their daring trick, spining round and having kicks
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, but price wars don't always make sense.
<WhatPayne> No they dont
<RobotPinkie> or bidding wars, rather
<mexican> perform for crowds of thousands, thell shower us with diamonds
*LunaOnTheMoon is sad..."But..but...I can fly in from the moon! I don't even need any guards!"
<MeteorVenture> what do you even mean? why do you think i'm trolling?
<WhatPayne> I remember reading once about human mindset in these kinds of cases..
<RobotPinkie> Same thing with the Flutterplush... I mean it was pretty cool, but $600?
<Mike_Coltfield> Happy National Date Nut Bread Day, everypony.
<bicyclerepairman> imagine the shame you'd bring upon equestria turning up with no escort
<WhatPayne> At certain point you get affixed of winning the other side no matter the cost even through the price would no more make any sense...
<Tentacle_Horse_Trixie> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/6345
<Anonymous> .
<bicyclerepairman> besides, what kind of dresses have you got up there? 1000 year old fashion covered under a millennium of dust
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about luna sad meme artist:dalapony party (and 3 more)
<Synros> heyo everyone
<RobotPinkie> ebay would be so much better if people just put what they thought things were worth and then left it alone :P
<LunaOnTheMoon> *shrug* I can disuise myself well enoguh
<WhatPayne> I think it's the same as when you start certain project and at some point hit problems, but still are determined to finish it thinking you can't turn back anymore because of the time and money you've already wasted
<RobotPinkie> 'sup Synros
<LunaOnTheMoon> enough
<Synros> hey RP
<Synros> how are you doing?
<WhatPayne> Even through it would be more cheaper and sensible to stop instead of continuing...
<RobotPinkie> much better, thanks. How u?
<MeteorVenture> why do you think i'm trolling robotpinkie?
*LunaOnTheMoon wants to see all the pretty dresses and all the pretty ponies..
<bicyclerepairman> then imagine paparazzi finding out you where at the gala but didn't show yourself! oh the scandal!
<WhatPayne> Everypony is concerned of you RobotPinkie
<LunaOnTheMoon> *shrugs* not my fault!
<RobotPinkie> Eh? I just thought "typical furry mindset" didn't seem like it was intended as a compliment :P
<Pontang> Oh hey
<bicyclerepairman> would they care? they'd only construct a drama about you and your sister
<WhatPayne> It's so nice...
<Synros> not bad not bad.
<bicyclerepairman> and most of the people didn't forget that nightmare moon incident
<prince-dari> Hey.
<prince-dari> Can we switch over now?
<Pontang> If you want
<Synros> back is a little screw up tho, got a pinched nerve
<Balloons> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<RobotPinkie> ouch, that's not fun :(
<prince-dari> Gunna switch over the IRC now.
<prince-dari> Again.
<prince-dari> :P
<Balloons> No hug?
<RobotPinkie> lol to where?
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Balloons in a tight embrace
<Octavia> hm, i derp.
<LunaOnTheMoon> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<prince-dari> New network.
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around LunaOnTheMoon in a tight embrace
<Pontang> Thinking of adding a VPS to our list of servers. Hell, at those prices, might as well get all of them as VPS.
<Pontang> :P
<MeteorVenture> lol ok
<WhatPayne> I got nerve pinched in my right but-leg once... It was really nasty
<mexican> !plot
<prince-dari> XD
<Synros> yah, it feels like theres ice on it actually, I can't feel it
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<RobotPinkie> what's the new server address?
<LunaOnTheMoon> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Leonon> as we feed Darpy more muffins the plot thickens
<LunaOnTheMoon> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps LunaOnTheMoon
<mexican> yes
<WhatPayne> does irc.bronyserv.co.cc still work, or?
<prince-dari> That's what we're currently on WhatPayne.
<WhatPayne> So that's a no then?
<prince-dari> New network address will be in the topic when I've switched them over.
<mexican> !muffinkiss
*DerpyBot regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches mexican, showing her most adorable kissing face
<MeteorVenture> well no i actually really hate jokes like that.. i was just kinda saying that to see what would happen next.. i don't got anything against you or furries
<prince-dari> WhatPayne: I can keep it up if anyone wants it to stay up.

<DerpyBot> ..what?
<WhatPayne> Nah, it's better that there is only one place.

*DerpyBot flips a muffin
*DerpyBot catches the muffin with her hoof, correct side up
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing the Dash suit will go for around $5k
<prince-dari> Good, makes thing simpler.
<Rainbow_Dash> So, I will have to re-register names once you do that Prince-Dari?
<WhatPayne> Indeed
<prince-dari> Yes.

<prince-dari> Can you guess the 4 subjects I got A* in (only 4, I know, average), RainBro?
<RainBroDash> 10oh dari hai
<RainBroDash> 10and no, but I'll guess sciences and maths just because
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Eeyup, all the sciences and maths.
<RainBroDash> 10hahaha
<RainBroDash> 10best subjects to be fair.
<WhatPayne> Oh btw prince-dari, would you kindly then let us client users know the new server's address?
<prince-dari> >Electronics teacher gives us the specification for the wrong exam board
<RainBroDash> 10the rest are all weak as shit ;)
<prince-dari> >Get B anyway
<RainBroDash> 10Lol.
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<prince-dari> Like a baws.
<WhatPayne> When the change happens
<RainBroDash> 10liek a baws.
<prince-dari> WhatPayne: When I've switched them over yeah.
<WhatPayne> Thank you.
<mexican> !brushie
<RainBroDash> 10why we changing dari?
<RainBroDash> 10just out of interest
<prince-dari> Because commercial servers > home run servers
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> To put it simply.
<RainBroDash> 10fair.
<prince-dari> Oh, Rainbro.
<prince-dari> If you have something that fires a projectile.
<RainBroDash> 10hm?
<Rainbow_Dash> 3.6k on that mascot suit now
<prince-dari> And you're trying to hit something 2.5m away, how would you work out the angle needed to hit an alien?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> You get one test shot.
<Zephirdd> btw
<Rainbow_Dash> As much as they are paying for it, they could probably just get one commissioned on deviantArt
<Zephirdd> when does the stream begin today?
<Zephirdd> :P
<Rainbow_Dash> Someone could probably make a better one for that price
<prince-dari> Because we worked out the angle with insane maths that makes no sense and it worked - we raped maths and made it our bitch.
<RainBroDash> 10well, hold on
<RainBroDash> 10trying to hit something 2m away, what are you saying about aliens? O.o
<prince-dari> The thing you're trying to hit.
<prince-dari> It's an alien.
<prince-dari> Because you don't like aliens.
<prince-dari> They're different.
<RainBroDash> 10Right.
<prince-dari> So you want to kill them.
<RainBroDash> 10So it's 2.5m away?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
*Zephirdd is sad because of people ignoring him
<RainBroDash> 10and you're firing a projectile
<prince-dari> Zephirdd: 5pm EST
<Zephirdd> ty prince-dari :D
<RainBroDash> 10>run at it and beat the shit out of it ;)
<RainBroDash> 10but yeah, hold on
<Rainbow_Dash> RainBroDash, dead island has taught me thats it better to use sharp objects
<Rainbow_Dash> Not projectiles
<prince-dari> Other than aliens, the other example was they're Germans.
<prince-dari> And we're in 1940.
<RainBroDash> 10Lol.
<RainBroDash> 10Or, germans, just for the sake of it
<mexican> got banished to the lack of internet
*RainBroDash 10is a cunt
<prince-dari> So.
<prince-dari> How would you do it?
*GGgala de-lurks, scrolls up
<prince-dari> I'd assume that the way we did it was wrong, even though it worked. XD
<mexican> is every1 asleep or something?
<Lilfut> so i am going to buy the 20% cooler shirt at hot topic
<Zephirdd> there is an email in by inbox
<DecapMobile> Hey guys
<Zephirdd> it better be diablo 3 beta
<mexican> did i miss a call from princess celestia to a meeting?
<GGgala> wait, when is the irc switch happening? today?
<Zephirdd> fuck, its just some math exercises
<Lilfut> but i dont know what i can wear to distance myself from the people who go there
<Lilfut> halp?
<GGgala> and lulz. dat maths raep
<bicyclerepairman> absolutely nothing
*RainBroDash 10is thinking
<RainBroDash> 10Assuming it's a suvat question?
<mexican> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:21h:26m:21s
<RobotPinkie> suvat?
<prince-dari> Well.
<DecapMobile> Theres an IRC deity today?
<Lilfut> i also dont want to be arrested
<Nashy> Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you because they don't like your parties and don't want to be your friends anymore!
<prince-dari> You can't really use suvat with what you start with.
<Lilfut> also that is the sort of thing a hipster would... "wear"
<RainBroDash> 10although, I guess you don't know the speed of the projectile yeah
<bicyclerepairman> fine, be picky :P
<DecapMobile> *switch
<GGgala> DecapMobile: lolwut?
<prince-dari> You just have the distance, and acceleration.
<RainBroDash> 10hm
<Nashy> wear a suit
<GGgala> DecapMobile: how do those word even...
<mook> stay classy
<Nashy> tuxedo, etc
<bicyclerepairman> wear two suits!
<GGgala> *words
<prince-dari> (Acceleration because gravity, derp)
<Lilfut> two suits is ironic
<RainBroDash> 10yeah ofc
<bicyclerepairman> three?
<Lilfut> screw it, ill just go in my standard t-shirt and shorts
<RobotPinkie> and you have the force, since you can fire a test shot....
<Lilfut> MAINSTREAM
<bicyclerepairman> when does it start to be ridiculous again?
<DecapMobile> Because of autocorrect
<prince-dari> Yeah, you got a test shot.
<RainBroDash> 10something stupid like shoot straight up, and then time it to gauge the initial velocity?
<bicyclerepairman> five? ten?
<Nashy> Why do you need to distance yourself anyway?
<RainBroDash> 10well yeah ignoring wind resistance time the amount of time to hit the ground, and stuff
<Lilfut> it is ridiculous past 1
<Nashy> Sounds like a hipster move.
<prince-dari> >we decided we should have shot straight up after already doing the test shot at 45 degrees - it worked anyway XP
<Lilfut> because i do not want to be seen as a hot topicite
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<bicyclerepairman> hm
<GGgala> awesome
<Nashy> Oh no, someone saw me enter Hot Topic D:~~
<Nashy> The shame!
<Lilfut> t-shirt and shorts
<bicyclerepairman> doesn't everyone who goes to hot topic not want to look like he's going to hot topic?
<Lilfut> not a skinny t-shirt
<AllisZero> Morning guys
<Lilfut> just a regular t-shirt
<bicyclerepairman> so they buy clothes at hot topic to look like they're not going to hot topic
<bicyclerepairman> … aaand now i'm confused
<Lilfut> I WILL BE THE ULTIMATE CONFORMIST
<Leonon> No, I will!
<prince-dari> Oh, and we didn't use suvat anyway and it still worked.
<Rainbow_Dash> Morning
<mexican> whatever...
<mexican> i conform with it
<Lilfut> i have a brony shirt, but thats there to signal my intent
<DecapKing> What are you guys talking about?
<RobotPinkie> morning AllisZero
<GGgala> fancy mathematics.
<NewDCD> 9guys hey guys
<NewDCD> 9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmFEXNpmCLA&t=01m06s
<prince-dari> Well, actually suvat was used earlier to get an equation for the flight time of the projectile.
<NewDCD> 9NewDCDsbananimation.jpg
<AllisZero> I'm at home today, called in sick to work :\
<NewDCD> 9*avi
<MPR|> <bicyclerepairman> absolutely nothing
<Nashy> I don't know if I'd wear a pony shirt.
<MPR|> classy, but likely to cause lawsuits
<RobotPinkie> ohay NewDCD
<bicyclerepairman> well, you gotta be quick
<RainBroDash> 10lol, yeah I assume you don't need suvat
<RainBroDash> 10um
<RainBroDash> 10just trying to think >.>
<RainBroDash> 10decapking just some random question on one of his exams, he wants me to answer it
<RainBroDash> 10but I haven't had to /think/ in over 3 months soo
<RainBroDash> 10ikr
<Lilfut> im reading the cracked article about creepy ancient robuts
<bicyclerepairman> you wouldn't want to spend much time at hot topic, would you?
<prince-dari> Wasn't on an exam, we just spent a lesson trying to kill aliens.
<MPR|> you have to play Yakety Sax the entire time while being chased by cops and beautiful women
<RainBroDash> 10oh win
<MPR|> run in, grab the shirt, leave the money, run out
<RainBroDash> 10or, germans
<RainBroDash> 10either way
<Lilfut> know what?
<Lilfut> t-shirt.
<Lilfut> shorts.
<Colson> That's what I usually wear!
<bicyclerepairman> nonono, not play
<bicyclerepairman> sing it
<bicyclerepairman> loud and proud
<RobotPinkie> daleks, hopefully
<RobotPinkie> so how much doctor who has been streamed?
<RobotPinkie> i fear it's gonna take me ages to catch up...
<mook> we don't normally wear clothes, yknow
<Lilfut> oh jesus
<Lilfut> laffing sal
<Lilfut> it is not laughing
<Lilfut> it is weeping
<Lilfut> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcEyYFS8hNQ&feature=player_embedded
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Simon Meets Laughing Sal
<Lilfut> i am sorry
<Rainbow_Dash> Prince-Dari, I hope I get a class like yours
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<Nashy> Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'!
<Rainbow_Dash> Ah yes.. Applejack
*Applejack woke up(actually 3 hours ago)
<Applejack> howdy there
<Rainbow_Dash> Hey
<Applejack> !!
<Rodman> @pony The one who woke up Applejack
<Applejack> no Steven Magnet, sugarcube
<Rodman> What, no Steven Magnet?
<Applejack> =3
<Rodman> :(
<Applejack> nah
<prince-dari> What we did was time the air time and measure the distance the projectile went at 45 degrees. suvat for an equation to calculate the flight time (it also tells us that s along the x-axis is equal to flight time times v).
<Applejack> don't you use ur fancy mathematics on me

<mook> hm, nah
<mook> !link
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/2955
<Rainbow_Dash> No Steven_Magnet.. What is the meaning of this?
<Applejack> Rainbow, sugar, he needs to take care of his BEYOOTIFUL moustacaaache, dontcha think?
<Applejack> howdy there Luna
<Applejack> :,C
<Luna> 07howdy Applejack!
<Applejack> =3
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi Luna
<IAmNotAGoat> the chat feels slow today....
<mexican> i think it died
<prince-dari> So then we worked out what the horizontal velocity had was because we now had the flight time and d.
<Applejack> dari, sugarcube, what in hay are yall talkin bout?
<prince-dari> Because we fired the projectile at 45 degrees the vertical velocity had to be the same anyway, cos45 and sin45 are 0.7
<IAmNotAGoat> Probably due to the time of day....well anyhow, how're you today Mexi?
<prince-dari> So they were 70% of the resultant velocity.
<Rodman> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/9737b708a5ce56fec39a692aa6156f9f/32192%20-%20Nigel_Thornberry%20artist%3Anetherlips%20crossover%20steven_magnet%20the_wild_thornberrys.png
*Applejack is confused
<prince-dari> So /70 * 100 of course, and now we had the v.
<Applejack> erm...wut
<mook> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/52399
<prince-dari> So we could put the intial velocity into the equation that calculates the flight time.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about artist:iggich party blank_flank gummy highres (and 1 more)
*Luna has no idea what's going on
<RobotPinkie> ohay Luna
<Nashy> that looks creepy D:
<Applejack> neither do i Luna...
<prince-dari> MFW RainBro wasn't watching >_>
<Rodman> I am absolutely loving this song
<Applejack> =3
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7uMwXYU9U&feature=related
<Applejack> ill be right bak
*Applejack started reading "On a Cross and Arrow part 10" =3
<Rainbow_Dash> I already read it
<Rainbow_Dash> I am sad it will be ending soon
<Rainbow_Dash> My life wont be the same without it
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
<prince-dari> Anyway we used suvat to work out the flight time the projectile would need for a displacement of 2.5m by trial and error.
*Luna reads the chat, but is still confused
<prince-dari> Then worked out the angle that would be needed to hit the alien with this time in the flight time equation.
<prince-dari> Except...
<Luna> 07What in the hay is going on in here?
<prince-dari> The angle we got we -23.something.
<prince-dari> Which was...
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> So we fired it at 23. whatever it was, and it went way too far.
<prince-dari> So for some reason.
<Rainbow_Dash> Something about aliens and projectiles Luna
<prince-dari> One of us decided to add 90 to it.
<Luna> 07ahhh...
<prince-dari> To get 67. something.
<Luna> 07RobotPinkie how you feel?
<prince-dari> We fired it at that angle.
<prince-dari> And it hit the alien.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Applejack> ah think dari is trying to mind rape you guys, but gladly i am not here so...
<Rainbow_Dash> Fancy Mathematics
<AllisZero> Is it odd that I remember similar calculations from my physics classes?
<prince-dari> Why would it be?
<RobotPinkie> much better, Luna, thanks
<WhatPayne> Oh Luna's here?
<RobotPinkie> how are you, Luna?
<Iks> pinkie always looks creepy
<AllisZero> Cause I don't remember much else from my physics classes lul
<Luna> 07Yep, i'm here
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie Are Dead (http://tinyurl.com/3nbzz4u)
<Rainbow_Dash> ....
<Colson> D:?
<AllisZero> /facehoof
<Hayfever> saywha
<Rainbow_Dash> Funny how I have both of the nicknames registered.. So I guess im dead twice?
<AllisZero> That theme is getting old isn't it?
<bicyclerepairman> heh
<Hayfever> will not read :(
<Rainbow_Dash> Yeah, Seth must have something against them
<Rainbow_Dash> He loves posting those stories
<bicyclerepairman> can't be bothered to read… gotta do like twilight does
<Rainbow_Dash> I should of known
<Rainbow_Dash> Cereal Velocity posted it
<WhatPayne> So what's today's schedule?
<Colson> magic
<bicyclerepairman> well, that would be much more useful..
<bicyclerepairman> nah, study
<Colson> :<
<Nashy> Dash and Pinkie are dead? Do not want!
<bicyclerepairman> feels like magic though oO

<AllisZero> Wow, this, so much this
<Rainbow_Dash> That is quite the image AllisZero
<AllisZero> A true artist right there
<Rainbow_Dash> Yeah, and that picture reminds me of something..
<Rainbow_Dash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDcWvZCSRg&ob=av3e This maybe?
<Rainbow_Dash> Maybe that
<AllisZero> I think I have more mucus in my head than brains right now
<AllisZero> Holy shit
<Rainbow_Dash> Maybe you do
<AllisZero> Luckly things in the office seem to be doing OK
<Rainbow_Dash> How much longer until the server switch Prince-Dari?
<MrPoniator> Now RD is shipped with Pinkie and death at the same time
<MrPoniator> Yep
<MeteorVenture> curse those clothes they clothe nothing
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol MV
<AllisZero> Just got an e-mail from some dude at the Florida wildlife trade commission
<AllisZero> "COOLER WEATHER IS HERE, WHY NOT GO HUNTING?"
<AllisZero> >Cooler weather
<AllisZero> >100F outside
<GGgala> Oh Florida
<prince-dari> It's probably about...20% cooler than before.
<MeteorVenture> i guess you're not "here" or maybe they sent you that message at midnight
<GGgala> lawl, it's noon in Florida right now :P
<Rainbow_Dash> Its noon in South Carolina to
<MeteorVenture> also who actually checks their emails?
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<AllisZero> I do lol
<Nittany_Tiger> It's 12:10 here. :p
<AllisZero> Same
<MeteorVenture> true true
<Nittany_Tiger> Go Eastern Daylight Time zone!
<Rainbow_Dash> Same Nittany
<MrPoniator> Damnit, why did I have to come down with a flu?
<MrPoniator> Would like to work on mah ponymation, but I feel too crappy to do anything productive
<Xedma> you ponies know of the australian nickelodeon competition?
<WhatPayne> Lol! I'm so silly
<AllisZero> Oh what a magical place, and I owe it all to the pegasus race!
<WhatPayne> I was looking at that Dash suit at ebay and was thinking why exactly is that suit like that of horse...
<WhatPayne> Then I realized...
<Applejack> wait..."Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie are dead?"...WHAT IN TARNATION???
<chunkatuff> with fan art like that i could actually fall for pinkamina
<Xedma> "In 25 words or less tell us what imaginative adventure would you like to go on with your MY LITTLE PONY friend?"
<chunkatuff> i need sleep
<Applejack> howdy there ValtheJean
<MrPoniator> Have dem crazy parties, Pinkie style!
<Ali1017> Wait, Nickelodeon has MLP FIM in Australia?
<AllisZero> Realized what, WhatPayne
<Xedma> My 25 words or less - "The mane six and I would head over to the Middle East and instal a regiem of love and tolerance."
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy applejack
<Xedma> think I will win?
<Xedma> http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/competitions/mylittlepony/
<WhatPayne> I realized that in fact ponies are like horses... And I was thinking of how silly Dash is not horse, she's pegasus...
<chunkatuff> ARGH this thing will never let me log in as meteorventure
<Iks> youi should start with israel cause there is where all the agression goes out of
<LvS> they might be looking for something a bit more... whimsical.
<Applejack> =P
<Luna> 07Alright you guys
<Luna> 07I hope you like Weeds
<Luna> 07cause it will be on in a couple mins
<Applejack> =o
<WhatPayne> The series weeds?
<Luna> 07oui
<WhatPayne> or the plant?
<Nittany_Tiger> No, then plant.
<Nittany_Tiger> :p
<Luna> 07the series dummy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no House? D:
<MeteorVenture> interesting
<WhatPayne> Oh how silly.
<Xedma> that is whimsical :3
<Luna> 07House will follow after 2 eps of Weeds
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wewt!
<prince-dari> Just switched.
<Xedma> to suddenly instal a regiem like that? totally on a whim.
*ValtheJean 2,14 needs him some House before he goes to class :P
<LvS> well, okay, that's true. i suppose that depends on how you're planning to do that exactly.
<AllisZero> Eh
<AllisZero> Do I want to watch this
<WhatPayne> Wasn't there supposed to be Entourage?
<Luna> 07entourage was lagging
<Applejack> hmmm
<Xedma> best not to discuss the detail ..... give away the surprise ;)
<WhatPayne> Oh, ok. That's cool too. Weeds in another show I haven't watched.
<Nittany_Tiger> Another server change?
<LvS> especially since it would take more than 25 words, i presume
<Xedma> eeyup
<MeteorVenture> this can't be the right chat
<prince-dari> It is.
<prince-dari> :)
<MeteorVenture> k
<Xedma> look the point is after all that is done to instal the regiem, afterwards is nothing but love and tolerance
<Nittany_Tiger> Make up your mind where you want the mane chat to be.
<Xedma> might not be many people left to love and tolerate ... but you get the picture
<LvS> by law
<prince-dari> STFU Nittany. :P
<prince-dari> INB4 akick
<RobotPinkie> Weeds? No idea
<LvS> ugh, sounds like one of those "kill everyone" solutions
<Nittany_Tiger> :p
<Xedma> nope
<Xedma> more like a Bring Back the Portal to Equestria from the Moon
<Iks> "they created a desolation and called it peace"
<AllisZero> HOOONEEEEEY~
<AllisZero> Oh what a magical place
<MeteorVenture> cause i have reconnected here once and i was the only one in the chatroom.. then i rejoined in a new tab and i was in the right place again
<AllisZero> And I owe it all to the pegasus race!
<LvS> i... didn't even know there was a portal to equestria on the moon?
<WhatPayne> Am I in right place?
<Rainbow_Dash> Refreshing didnt work.
<Xedma> yeah
<Sheep> hello everypony
<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<Silverscreen> What's the server name for this?
<LvS> hello
<Xedma> it's on the moon due to the portal not reacting well with oxygen
<Sheep> whats goin on?
<Xedma> hiya
<Xedma> http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/competitions/mylittlepony/
<Xedma> win ponies
<Doctor_Scraps> Goooooood morning Equestria Daily! This is DJ Doctor Scraps coming to you LIVE, with a hot dog, and you don't.
<prince-dari> This is irc.bronychat.net
<LvS> i suppose it would be easier to just seal it inside of some sort of vacuum tank
<Sheep> 25 words...
<Sheep> how am I supposed to do it in 25 words...
<Xedma> I know
<Leonon> that nickelodian link is golden
<prince-dari> AllisZero: Don't do that.
<Xedma> My 25 words or less - "The mane six and I would head over to the Middle East and instal a regiem of love and tolerance."
<Sheep> ^lol
<AllisZero> Eh?
<Rainbow_Dash> Do what?
<prince-dari> Sing.
<prince-dari> Trololo.
<Leonon> they make you sign up to enter
*Nittany_Tiger sings and explodes
<Iclare_Krual> Ok, guys, Subject for something thats been bugging me: Where does all that milk come from? For the pies.
<Xedma> I had to :|
<Doctor_Scraps> I'd propose a Pony theme to certain christian groups if I wasn't so afraid that someone somewhere would nail Fluttershy to the cross
<AllisZero> :(
<AllisZero> I can't sing?!
<GGgala> wait what. what sever address?
<Doctor_Scraps> Cows
<Wrek> 05there
<Xedma> cows
<LvS> well, there ARE cows.
<Iclare_Krual> Yes, but how
<Wrek> 05registered and set up
<GGgala> dari?
<Iclare_Krual> They have no hands
<Pinkie_Pie> Testing to see if enforce is on by default now
<GGgala> ...oh, topic is different now duh
<Xedma> orgy?
<LvS> well... the cows are sentient, apparently
<Doctor_Scraps> In Boast Busters, we are treated to a scene where Twilight telepathically milks...a whole barn of cows
<LvS> they might have figured out a way to milk themselves and sell the milk
<Doctor_Scraps> and in Equestria, you'd be amazed how much you can do with a hoof
<prince-dari> Ohai GGgala
<LvS> or maybe they have milking machines
<Sheep> or maybe unicorns just do it.
<GGgala> ohai dari
<GGgala> does this server have SSL?
<AllisZero> Gonna watch Tiger & Bunny, brb
<Iks> or human slaves that they whip out of the basement at night
<prince-dari> SSL, hm.
<Nittany_Tiger> Don't spy on me.
<Doctor_Scraps> it's not like they aren't able to do fine detail work. Did Rarity use her hoofs to try and fix Twilights bird nest?
<Rainbow_Dash> Prince-Dari, what be the channel register command?
<prince-dari> Someone wants to know if you've got SSL up Pontang.
<LvS> she did, but that didn't seem to work at all.
<prince-dari> :P
<Leonon> Rarity fixed Twilight's bird nest?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh dari, you troll
<LvS> she tried
<LvS> but alas, the nest was beyond salvation.
<Xedma> and thus twilight single hoofedly
<Xedma> disabled an entire section of the Winter Wrap up crew
<LvS> a severely undermanned section, though
<LvS> or underponied
<Rainbow_Dash> Okay, thanks
<Iclare_Krual> Thanks for the info. I guess
<Rainbow_Dash> At least I got to it before E_N this time
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<Doctor_Scraps> It's Rarity. She can make five dresses single handedly in a single montage
<Xedma> so
<Leonon> birds should make their own dang nests
<Xedma> anypony else think of 25 words or less adventure?
<LvS> yes, but the mayor said they'd need several hundred nests
<Doctor_Scraps> Then they were obviously going to need a lot more montages
<Sheep> i cant do 25 words, when I write, i write a lot
<WhatPayne> Oh I found new song I can't stop listening. "Fluttershy's Lament"
<Sheep> also, i dont feel like subjecting my brain to 25 word torture before work
<Xedma> it's simple
<Xedma> think of something, write it down
<Sheep> welcome zanzibar
<Luna> 07streams up
<Xedma> then count the words
<Xedma> then simplify it
<Wrek> 05*insert tunign in sound here*
<Wrek> 05tuning*
<Leonon> We would go to Salliongrad to fight against Kratos The Gluemaker and his evil Nazi Vampire/werewolf bragade
<Leonon> I still have 8 words to work with
<Silverscreen> 11Dari, did you copy all of the old chat scripts and put them in here?
<Xedma> submit it!
<bicyclerepairman> nazi vampire werewolf zombies
<Xedma> it might win and be aired on Australian tv
<Xedma> ZOMBIE?!!!
<Leonon> We would go to Salliongrad to fight against Kratos The Gluemaker and his evil Nazi Vampire/werewolf brigade and there would be epic explosions and stuff--sone
<GGgala> dari: never mind, it does! port 6697.
<Leonon> er, done
<prince-dari> The scripts are on my client, so nothing to change other than in the EQD script.
<mib_6gp9d9> 12Testing color chat.
<Sheep> is that like
<mib_6gp9d9> 12Yep, it's working
<Doctor_Scraps> It's missing the important "and then Fluttershy told everyone to play nice, and they did."
<mib_6gp9d9> 12KICK ME! DO IT FILLY!
<MeteorVenture> NO i must go to sleep immediately to listen to this song while wide awake
<Sheep> vampires mixed with werewolves, or vampires and werewolves
<Xedma> it needs something
<SirSprinkles> 6lawl
<Xedma> I know! Galoshes
<Leonon> Sheep, yes
<prince-dari> Hey Pontang?
<MeteorVenture> i've not listened to fluttershy's lament before
<prince-dari> You here?
<MeteorVenture> all my senses
<Silverscreen> 11Awesome. And you still got Steven Magnet bot too, right?
<prince-dari> Yeah, but I haven't got him on right now.
<Leonon> if Fluttershy told everyone to play nice then we can't have Flutterrage with a flamethrower burning Nazi Vampires and/or Werewolves
<Leonon> You're going to LOVE ME! *burns everything*
<Sheep> xD
<bicyclerepairman> nazi vampires or nazi werewolves?
<Silverscreen> 11Awesome.
<Silverscreen> 11And lastly...
<Silverscreen> 11!Nicks
<Xedma> both!
<Leonon> both, possibly at the same time, possibly as the same individuals
<WhatPayne> MeteorVenture: Me neither, found it today, but it's really good IMO
<Silverscreen> 11!Nick
<prince-dari> Silverscreen: Only works in the mod channel. :P
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Silverscreen> 11oh.
<Rainbow_Dash> !Nick
<Silverscreen> 11that explains it.
<Rainbow_Dash> !Nicks
<Rainbow_Dash> Eh?
<Luna> 07!nicks
<Luna> 07works ;)
<bicyclerepairman> or just a group of vampire werewolves who by chance are nazis?
<Xedma> they will be hiding in a spot vampires can't reach taking a breather when suddenly "HEY GUESS WHAT! We're werevolves too. HIEL HITLER!"
<Leonon> they are Nazis led by Kratos the Gluemaker
<WhatPayne> The stream is little small...
<bicyclerepairman> would they become regular nazis in the sunlight?
<RobotPinkie> this Doctor Who episode is very... resident evil...
<Xedma> :| ... didn't think about sunlight
<MeteorVenture> i started up the song.. and i decided not to listen to it yet.. a song this good deserves the proper setting
<Doctor_Scraps> Violent ponies make me sad.
<Leonon> well some of them are Vampires, and some of them are Werewolves, and some of them are vampires AND werewolves, so.....I have no idea
<Applejack> aaaaah, much better
<bicyclerepairman> who's violent?
<Luna> 07welcome back AJ
<Silverscreen> 11Which means we need to set up mod channel. The new name for it is... *checks forums* #Luna
<Thorinair> Pinkamena I guess?
<Applejack> ty =3
<Thorinair> :P
<Silverscreen> 11With #Celestia being the admin channel.
<Leonon> Rarity is violent
<bicyclerepairman> so the vampires wouldn't survive the sunlight, it wouldn't affect werewolves though
<MeteorVenture> what i said kinda reminds me of kamina
<Xedma> and flutterrage
<Applejack> i think something crashed, i couldn't enter the chat
<bicyclerepairman> but vampire werevolves… hm
<Doctor_Scraps> -puts head under pillow- ...Tumblr has created an evil thing
<WhatPayne> Oh better, thank you Luna
<Luna> 07your welcome ;)
<bicyclerepairman> and if you're bitten by a nazi vampire werewolf, do you become one yourself?
<RobotPinkie> always with the making Luna lesser than Celestia...
<Applejack> so, THAT'S weed?
<bicyclerepairman> or just a regular vampire werewolf
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Leonon> yes
<bicyclerepairman> i see
<Sheep> you become a nazi vampire werewolf
<Wrek> 05never saw that show
*Silverscreen 11makes note to edit the rules list to change the appeals room name then.
<Sheep> and the vampires dont burn in sunlight, they just turn into werewolves
<bicyclerepairman> but werewolves are only… wolf-y in the night
<Sheep> maybe Nightmare Moon brought about the unending night with the help of Kratos the GlueMaker
<Barry> hi,guys
<Sheep> and now the mane 6 have to go end it.
<Sheep> but little did they know they'd run into nazi vampire werewolves
<Applejack> howdy there Barry
<Barry> what is this?

<Sheep> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Sheep> yes derpy, i do
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Sheep

<HaysforPonies> It's going to go even quicker when Season 2 comes.
<RobotPinkie> I watched the trailer for this, looks pretty sweet
<Something> Hold on, let me change this username
<Dashite> inb4 Someone
<Iks> i estimated that it will hit 40 million around the 17th
*EspyLacopa pokes channel for IRC server info
<EspyLacopa> prince-dari: I'm trying to get the actual IRC network so that I can use something /other/ than Mibbit.
<LvS> and it seems like just yesterday that we hit 30 million...
<RobotPinkie> snarf!
<Sheep> oh god the 17th
<ValtheJean> well...at least this snarf isn't as annoying...
<Sheep> i hope this season is as good, or better than the first
<GGgala> excellent
<prince-dari> The address is in the topic.
<prince-dari> That's why I told you to read it.
<Sheep> (i just hope it stays good)
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> Wait.
<bicyclerepairman> well, why shouldn't it be?
<prince-dari> This is epic-chat.
<bicyclerepairman> everything's mostly the same
<prince-dari> You're WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY behind.
<EspyLacopa> Yeeees
<prince-dari> We already switched to a different network ages ago.
<Sheep> yeah...
<Sheep> i just..
<bicyclerepairman> the production process, i mean
<prince-dari> And just switched again today.
<bicyclerepairman> don't worry :-)
<Ali1017> !S2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:19h:46m:30s
<EspyLacopa> I lost the info when I changed computers.
<Sheep> Ahhh
<EspyLacopa> And the current mibbit thing on the website doesn't have the info.
<EspyLacopa> *poke poke poke*
<RobotPinkie> technology is 99% magnets.
<Iks> well the first 2 episodes of season 2 would be the same quality at least as season 1 cause those episodes were supposed to be in season 1
<GGgala> wait... what's the point of Thundercats if it isn't all EIGHTIES
<WhatPayne> dat anime influence
<DeniedExistenceMobile> My IRC client isn't showing irc.bronychat.net as viable
<EspyLacopa> I tried connecting to <rainbowdash.bronychat.net>, but that didn't work.
<Iks> so the 3rd episode is the real 1st of season 2 without Faustian oversight
<klaxa> what do you mean "without fautian oversight"?
<klaxa> she agreed to be a consultant executer or something
<RobotPinkie> so does this have a proper story arc and everything?
<klaxa> or did i get that wrong?
<HaysforPonies> She's still there for season 2.
<HaysforPonies> Just in a different position
<ValtheJean> "awesome" power
<WhatPayne> That sounded lame
<bicyclerepairman> executer? :D
<prince-dari> You have to connect to irc.bronychat.net
<EspyLacopa> Ah, huzzah, that worked.
<Lysiria> Lauren Faust - Executioner
<Lysiria> ...I don't see this happening.
<GGgala> oh wait, this is a sequel in continuity?
<Iks> fire the Laurenfaust!
<ValtheJean> god I hope not
<Luna> 07not sure this is the first ep I could find
<WhatPayne> That reminded me, we should totally watch Game of Thrones
<TheSonicRainboom> Good day!
<VioletVanilla> 6Same thing here, it redirects to here. . .
<klaxa> yes bicyclerepairman, executer :[
<LvS> hello
<VioletVanilla> 6 >~< Oh dear, but I do not want to stress Dari anymore. . .
<GGgala> "our ancestors, the Tundercats" "first defeated Mumm-Ra"
<GGgala> sounds like a distant-future sequel
<ValtheJean> well I think even in the original it was like that
<EspyLacopa> Ahhhhh, much better
<prince-dari> I'm connected to it.
<prince-dari> Through mIRC.
<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> that councilor guy

<GGgala> meanwhile, racism
<EspyLacopa> These new Wiley twins are awesome.
<Gummy> I have no trouble with Celestia being literally as old as the hills. I don't think she had any predecessors.
<RobotPinkie> This is why Norwegian forest cats are superior, btw: http://www.findakitten.co.uk/images/nfcuni.jpg

<EspyLacopa> Yaaay, technology.
<RainBroDash> 10oh, yeah

<HotCocoa> Pfft, no references to the Diamond Dogs?
*EspyLacopa waits for Mum-Ra to show up
<AllisZero> Third time they used that scene
<ValtheJean> lol, hurray for cycled animation
<EspyLacopa> Those lizards had long range missiles.
<Dashite> That's totally cheating...
<EspyLacopa> Technological Superiority!

<HotCocoa> David Bowie.
<Fluttershy> What in the...? Why are there missiles? o-o
<Bpendragon> yep
<HotCocoa> "The plotting on the current cartoon is much better."
<HotCocoa> ^
<Applejack> Fluttershy: I have NO idea
<RobotPinkie> >Thundercats
<RobotPinkie> >mech suits
<HotCocoa> Even journalists recognize a good plot when they see one.
<prince-dari> You mean why aren't there MORE missiles?
<Fluttershy> Oh dear... e-e;
<RobotPinkie> I'm confused.
*Fluttershy clings to Applejack
<ValtheJean> I'm just waiting for some Lizard Carpet Bombing :P

<MrPoniator> Having a flu sucks yo
<EspyLacopa> Go Liono, go!
<bicyclerepairman> wrong button oO

<Fluttershy> Oh no oh no oh no oh no!
<Fluttershy> -hides behind Applejack, whimpering- ><
<Wrek> 05this feels so familliar its uncanny
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi Fluttershy
<Applejack> Calm down, cugarcube...ah'm sure they'll win this
<AllisZero> This is a clusterfuck
<AllisZero> Technology, magic, voodoo, zombies
<Fluttershy> :< I don't like fighting...
<Wrek> 05and cupcakes?
<EspyLacopa> We're missing space aliens.
<RandomExtra> Is pinkie pie server down? I tried to connect through it earlier and it terminated me.
<Applejack> well...didn't see THAt one comin
<HotCocoa> And see, that's just one more reason I don't drink.
<HotCocoa> You never know whose apple tree you'll wind up in the next morning.
<EspyLacopa> Yay, key
<GGgala> good job, Androcles
*Applejack is pleased
<ValtheJean> good old forshadowing
<Silverscreen> 11...what is this?
<EspyLacopa> Thundercats!
<Silverscreen> 11THUNDERCATS
<Silverscreen> 11:D
<RandomExtra> The new ThunderCats
<Silverscreen> 11Is it good?
<VioletVanilla> 6So far yes~
<ValtheJean> it's....different
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I like it
<prince-dari> Tentacle rape.
<RandomExtra> I've heard good things, but I just got here 1 minute or so ago
<RobotPinkie> very different from old Thundercats, yeah
<VioletVanilla> 6I have see enough hentai to know where this is going. . . x.x
<ValtheJean> so far the new Snarf is the endearing quality to me
<Applejack> Snake tiem
*EspyLacopa wonders what Cheetara is doing.
<Dashite> Dari, would that be tentacle necrophilia? I mean, he is a mummy so he's undead right?
<EspyLacopa> THUNDERCATS HO!
<GGgala> reverse necrophilia, at that
<RobotPinkie> THUNDER
<Applejack> DAT TITLEDROP
<FreezeFrame> I've been busy taking care of stuff and haven't even really looked at it yet
<AllisZero> Lazerbeam
<Silverscreen> 11Just a warning, if anyone is having trouble with the chat, it's because we're also doing tests with a new server. Worst comes to worse, we'll simply switch back to the old one until we get THIS one up and running correctly.
<ValtheJean> he fired his l@z0r
<EspyLacopa> Sunlight burns!
<EspyLacopa> Ohai there Cheetara
<Dashite> He's a vampire mummy?!
<HaysforPonies> Friends don't let friends drunk fly.
<AllisZero> Titties
<HaysforPonies> fly drunk*
<AllisZero> I'm not a furry but damn, I'd still hit it
<ValtheJean> those lizards can't aim for siht
<EspyLacopa> AllisZero: Mum-Ra wants to see their tits
<Dashite> Lizards = stormtroopers confirmed.
<ValtheJean> oh there they go!
<prince-dari> YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
<ValtheJean> of course, he isn't a main character
<ValtheJean> so of course they can hit him :P
<FreezeFrame> So I'm now taking accounting
<Wrek> 05AllisZero would hit it like the fist of an angry god
<EspyLacopa> Now they just need Panthro, and the Wiley Twins.
<ValtheJean> ^
<FreezeFrame> And it isn't as horrid a thing as I thought.
<Fluttershy> o-o His arm is glowing...
<prince-dari> LOL
<HotCocoa> If MLP were less kid-oriented, I'd say they should throw a "drunk moose in an apple tree" gag into the show just because that article makes me want to see that in MLP now.
<prince-dari> I knew it.
<AllisZero> Jaga confirmed for Gandalf
<prince-dari> You shall not pass moment, called it.
<Silverscreen> 11Storm Troopers: Professionally trained to be the greatest warriors of the universe. Can't hit 5 people running around.
<RobotPinkie> it hasn't been yet, though...
<Fluttershy> Sexy...?
<HotCocoa> And then they can throw the "based on a true story" tag in the episode.
<prince-dari> YOU! SHALL NOT! PASS!
<Silverscreen> 11YOU.
<Silverscreen> 11SHALL NOT!
<Silverscreen> 11PAAAAAASSS!
<ValtheJean> General confirmed for Balrog :P
<EspyLacopa> Aw, he didn't say it.
<Silverscreen> 11We said it for him.
<RobotPinkie> lol Val
<Silverscreen> 11I only watched five minutes of it.
<EspyLacopa> They still need the Wiley Twins
<Applejack> awwwww
<prince-dari> Ta to ba, tatoba ta to ba.
<Silverscreen> 11And I f*cking love it.
*Fluttershy loves Cheesecake. ^^
<RobotPinkie> yay!
<Applejack> =o
<ValtheJean> needs more panthro
*Silverscreen 11has to go to class. ;.;
<ValtheJean> I know that feel silver
<RobotPinkie> aw :(
*Wrek hugs Silverscreen, best of luck
<ValtheJean> I only have about an hour myself :(
*Applejack has to go to class soon as well :C
<EspyLacopa> Fluttershy: The only people who don't like Cheesecake are lactose intolerant people.
<RobotPinkie> I feel for you
<Cesco> I'm pretty sure that was the most random comment I have ever read. Granted, I just joined the room, but I get this feeling that there was absolutely no context for that.
<Dashite> Poor Silver. :(
<Barry> Cya, Silverscreen
<HotCocoa> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14842999
*Silverscreen 11never had cheesecake.
<prince-dari> WUT
<HotCocoa> ^ context.
<Dashite> EspyLacopa and not even all of them.
<Fluttershy> EspyLacopa: Ah, that's true... :C
<prince-dari> Never had cheesecake.
<ValtheJean> lol Espylacopa I love cheesecake and I am somewhat lactose intolerant :P
<prince-dari> MFW
<Wrek> 05EspyLacopa actually, i eat and love it anywasy
<Wrek> 05anyways*
<Cesco> And...... my day is complete
<RobotPinkie> :O
*Applejack brohoofs Silverscreen
*Fluttershy hugs Silverscreen :<
<Luna> 07Cheesecake is yummy
<Cesco> lol
<WhatPayne> Oh hello VioletVanilla, when did you get here?
<HotCocoa> You can thank Turgle
<Applejack> neither did i ^^
<RobotPinkie> he's a good artist
<ValtheJean> damn...he can draw well with a sword
<Gummy> This sort of thing is probably par for the course in Sweden.
<Gummy> They may not get the joke.
<RobotPinkie> I couldn't do that with a sword if my life depended on it
<EspyLacopa> They need a proper Thundertank.
<Fluttershy> Kittens! :3
<prince-dari> >Gold everywhere
<prince-dari> >steal clothes
<AllisZero> Hahaha yep
<Cesco> It's their method of marinading vennison
<ValtheJean> gold is useless when your market is fucking EXPLODED
<HotCocoa> Oh, yeah, I'm sure drunken moose are lining the streets the way cracked out bums do in downtown Chicago.
<Silverscreen> 11They has priorities.
<Dashite> When you steal everything anyway, who needs gold?
<OhYouFool> If anyone else wishes to waste a thursday afternoon and evening, feel free to drop by http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<OhYouFool> Marathon starting shortly
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...I think that's the greatest headline I have ever beheld in my entire life.
<Gummy> What will you be doing?
<OhYouFool> Our last marathon of the year
<Silverscreen> 11Snarf doesn't talk.
<OhYouFool> Sort of a pre-season 2 celebration thing
<Gummy> Marathon of what?
<HotCocoa> All 26 episodes?
*RobotPinkie snarfs
<Silverscreen> 11Thank f*cking god.
<Cesco> But I have class/errands!? I want synctube!
<Fluttershy> Kitties. ^^ Are so cute.
<HotCocoa> Ah.
<Gummy> Ah, episodes.
<OhYouFool> Yup
<OhYouFool> Non-stop
<EspyLacopa> Snarf is a pokemon in this world.
<ValtheJean> Snarf is actually appealing in this
<ValtheJean> which makes me enjoy watching it :P
<HaysforPonies> I don't think I would survive.
<Silverscreen> 11They could have easily turned Snarf into another Jar Jar Binks.
<HotCocoa> In other words, I hope you don't have to go to the bathroom anytime soon.
<Cesco> It's only 9 hours of show
<Cesco> .... if my math is right
<HotCocoa> More like 8, maybe 7 1/2
<Cesco> I don't think it is
<HotCocoa> 22 minutes an episode
<OhYouFool> 9 and a half to be precise
<HotCocoa> 22 x 26
<Cesco> well then...
<Luna> 07pretty pleaseeeeee
<Silverscreen> 11...
<ValtheJean> why are they the only ones with tails?
<Silverscreen> 11Lionel's an asshole.
<HotCocoa> 572 minutes
<EspyLacopa> Liono, how you could be so heartless?
<prince-dari> He's pretty mean.
<AllisZero> Lol
<MrPoniator> Switched to laptop
<Gummy> That would take things a little late for me, but I may duck in and out.
<AllisZero> Meow meow
<WhatPayne> mkay
<Cesco> OhYouFool - when are you starting?
<Applejack> gosh...
<Silverscreen> 11Probably a puberty thing.
<OhYouFool> Like
<EspyLacopa> they follow anyways.
<OhYouFool> In 2 minutes
<GGgala> oh boy, the new meowception
<HotCocoa> Oh, it is 9.5
<Silverscreen> 11MEWO
<Turgle> my beloved mustache
<MrPoniator> Since I'm feeling too crappy to sit on my computer, I'll just use my lappie
<Turgle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVLJyIi2NE
<Silverscreen> 11MEOW*
<Silverscreen> 11I failed
<Fluttershy> ...wait, their tails retract when they grow up? Isn't that kinda backwards?
<OhYouFool> I'd have come earlier but I was hoping to get it plugged through other means
<RobotPinkie> That's right, meowth!
<OhYouFool> I'm sort of running it on behalf of the room owner
<Fluttershy> -blushes- n-nevermind, I didn't say anything.
<ValtheJean> lol, Peter Pan must be a wonderful story for them :P]
<Applejack> @FLuttershy: yea...
<Cesco> hmmmm
<Silverscreen> 11Tails are used for balance, but as they get older, they become balanced on their own two legs, hence they don't need a tail.
<ValtheJean> but dey so fwuffy!
<EspyLacopa> Liono has forgotten the power of Friendship.
<Cesco> I have to be at class in 5 hours.... need to make a few stops ahead of time... theoretically I should be doing the reading....
<ValtheJean> HE KILLED SNARF
<AllisZero> A ROCK
<Silverscreen> 11Either that or warriors purposly chop them off.
<Cesco> PONIES AWAY
<Wrek> 05mfw i heard "eohw fuck"
<HotCocoa> I should go into one of the conference rooms and hook up the 1080p projector
<HotCocoa> Stream ponies all day at work.
<Silverscreen> 11Mirage
<EspyLacopa> It's a trap!
<OhYouFool> You should
<OhYouFool> Do that
<OhYouFool> Totally
<Silverscreen> 11...
<prince-dari> Lawl
<HotCocoa> Need a better sound system though
<Silverscreen> 11or a trap
<RobotPinkie> that's not how mirages work....
<GGgala> food, floating on a evil sea of magic sand? NOTHING CAN GO WRONG
<prince-dari> >random food in the middle of a desert
<AllisZero> It's always a trap
<prince-dari> >no suspicion
<Cesco> Awww I'd go to see that
<HotCocoa> Laptop speakers wouldn't quite cut it
<RobotPinkie> lol

<Applejack> lol reverse? Fish people fishing
<Turgle> where i can find the first season in 1080p?
<ValtheJean> dear god...this is just like FF12
<HotCocoa> Well, we had a Buffy marathon a couple months ago, but that was after-hours.
<HotCocoa> Turgle: YouTube.
<RobotPinkie> desert fish, wow...
<Turgle> didn't they deleted all?
<GGgala> Britfish?
<HotCocoa> Although you're sacrificing 5.1 audio for 1080p
<HotCocoa> Turgle: nope.
<EspyLacopa> ValtheJean: I don't know, at least they are carting around useless people.
<Turgle> yay
<Turgle> thanks
<AllisZero> They have claws
<EspyLacopa> And this has fish-pirates.

*Applejack waves to everypony and leaves
<Silverscreen> THIS IS THUNDERCATS!
<RandomExtra> Bye Applejack
<Dashite> Nope, looks like madness to me!
<ValtheJean> inb4 snarf saves the day :P
<HotCocoa> Between YouTube and iTunes, I haven't really noticed a difference in quality
<Fluttershy> -giggles- epic timing with the soundboard
<bicyclerepairman> itunes got better audio encoding, i think
*EspyLacopa waits for cheering ponies
<Turgle> ^
<HotCocoa> Yeah, it's 5.1
*VioletVanilla cheers
<Silverscreen> 11Is it bad that I got work done/handed in early and skipping the class that it's suppose to be done in?
<RobotPinkie> are those potatoes?
<WhatPayne> I have no idea what's going on...
<ValtheJean> no at all silver :P
<VioletVanilla> 6No, that is something right Silver!
<Luna> 07lol
<EspyLacopa> Clever girl.
<HotCocoa> I downloaded a couple of the 1080p episodes from YouTube and am doing a re-render (re: un-DRM) of an iTunes episode to compare
<AllisZero> Adorable loli
<Silverscreen> 11Damn, they're good.
<Leonon> Itunes is slightly zoomed in and washed out too
<Dashite> Nah, not bad at all Silverscreen.
<WhatPayne> Hey Violet.
<Silverscreen> 11Lionel's face = Challenge accepted.
<ValtheJean> never thought I'd like a show's supporting characters more than the main
<Fluttershy> It looks kind of like a flower... o-o
<HotCocoa> Leonon, are you sure you aren't watching the 480p "low-res" version?
<GGgala> what the hay, the kraken is a pitcher plant with prehensile tentacles?
<prince-dari> Mah boi
<VioletVanilla> 6http://alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/png/obama-not-bad.png
<Silverscreen> 11ValtheJean: that's the power of douchebaggery.
<ValtheJean> lol
<bicyclerepairman> the itunes eps do have weird colors
<Leonon> pretty sure
<bicyclerepairman> but there are filters available
<Fluttershy> Oh dear... who's played Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time?
<AllisZero> Eyes?
<Silverscreen> 11GGgala: It's a Victreebell?
<Barry> I have
<AllisZero> Everyone Fluttershy
<ValtheJean> lol I would hope everyone Fluttershy :P
<Fluttershy> d:
<VioletVanilla> 6I would hope everyone Fluttershy~
<bicyclerepairman> and the divx player at least manages to display a good picture
<GGgala> Silverscreen: lol
<AllisZero> Better question is, who HASN'T
<Leonon> it's 720 but if you compare with the 720 TV version it's very slightly zoomed in
*Silverscreen 11hasn't played OoT
<Fluttershy> Anyone see a resemblance between Obama and Ganondorf?
<HotCocoa> The colors can be corrected with filters. One guy who put a torrent together included a bunch of ffdshow filter files for color correction.
<Dashite> The question is do we mean completed, or played?
*ValtheJean murders silverscreen
<GGgala> lolwut ^
<AllisZero> Nooo
<EspyLacopa> LOL
<Dead> 11LOL
<bicyclerepairman> i'm too stupid to use the filters though :D
<Dashite> DAMN YOU LUNA!
<GGgala> FUUU SEAP ONIES
<AllisZero> Great timing
<RobotPinkie> WAT?
<ValtheJean> hahahaahaha
<VioletVanilla> 6XDDD
<Barry> I completed the game
<VioletVanilla> HAHAHAHAHAHA
<RobotPinkie> SHOO BE DOO!

<VioletVanilla> 6Poor Silversreeeeen!!!!
<ValtheJean> just lol
*Silverscreen 11failed.
<ValtheJean> that's my revenge for dari not adding me to the list yet :P
<VioletVanilla> 6Autokick by Dari~
<Silverscreen> 11I got pwned by the auto-script
<ValtheJean> you were just an innocent victim :P
<prince-dari> Revenge?
<Wrek> 05thank you mute!
<prince-dari> I like this song.
<prince-dari> Trololo.
<Barry> Why the hell are we watching this?
*EspyLacopa can't stop laughing
<Silverscreen> 11The song really isn't that bad.
<VioletVanilla> 6Trololo? I like this song~
<Fluttershy> That's what I was just thinking... o-o
<Silverscreen> 11It's too damn catchy, though.
<GGgala> wait... who's streaming?
<ValtheJean> I enjoy it because of the pain it causes on bronies :P
<RandomExtra> Luna I believe
<EspyLacopa> But can they escape the smooze?
<RobotPinkie> sea ponies are best ponies
<WhatPayne> It's Megan and Applejack!
<VioletVanilla> 6The catchyness of this song is TOO DAMN HIGH! D<
<prince-dari> It's bacon and Applejack!
<prince-dari> :P
<OhYouFool> We're roughly ten minutes into episode one, still a good time to join!! http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<GGgala> It's bacon and applejack!
<GGgala> dammit dari
<Fluttershy> ....Luna...? o-o;
<Barry> she trolled us
<MrPoniator> And I'm not too savvy about this stuff, as I often don't mind watching stuff in 360p instead of glorious 1080p
<Fluttershy> I think... you made my brain esplode.
<Luna> 07^.^
<Silverscreen> 11....
<Fluttershy> x-x
<EspyLacopa> Fish!Ahab vs MobyDick w/Tentacles
<VioletVanilla> 6:3 You are too wonderful Luna~
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<Turgle> one day i'll have a full-HD tv
*Barry heals Fluttershy's brain
<Silverscreen> 11Direct quote from Moby Dick
*Luna meows back
<Silverscreen> 11This show is made of win.
<ValtheJean> there is only one way for me to love this show
*VioletVanilla meows at the wall
<MrPoniator> I own a 4:3 CRT in my room
<Turgle> so i need the most high resolution videos :D
<ValtheJean> and that is TO BRING PANTHRO THE FUCK BACK
<Fluttershy> -brain is healed. all better now-
*Luna hugs Violet
<MrPoniator> And I'm totally fine playing PS3/X360 games on it
<EspyLacopa> Fluttershy: Shoo be doo
<Silverscreen> 11ValtheJean: Panthro is confirmed for the show, but he doesn't appear until later in the story.
<prince-dari> Wut
<HotCocoa> I'm picky about quality, but if I can't see a difference between a 480 rip and a 1080 rip, I'll stick with the less-space-consuming 480 rip.
<prince-dari> Pulling the fucking boat.
<Fluttershy> EspyLacopa: ><
<Leonon> I have the 720 TV that I watched and the 720 iTunes that I use for videos I make
*VioletVanilla is hug'd~ :3
<ValtheJean> then I don't love the show until he comes back :P
<ValtheJean> and no more mind control bullshit
<EspyLacopa> Giant sea anemone
<ValtheJean> I want him back as a main character :P
<GGgala> oh, it's like an anemone
<prince-dari> Tentacles.
<Fluttershy> 'slimy sack of tentacles'?
<prince-dari> She said it.
<Silverscreen> 11...
<Fluttershy> that sounds... awful
<Fluttershy> in so many ways... e-e;
<Dashite> Nope.
<Dashite> It's a giant waterballoon.
<EspyLacopa> Woo! Water!
<OhYouFool> You know you can just up the quality...
<RobotPinkie> I have seen enough sea ponies to know where this is going
<Silverscreen> 11That was so stupid yet it made so much sense.
<ValtheJean> lol
<OhYouFool> Your quality isn't locked to mine
<OhYouFool> And the videos are all 1080p ones
<Fluttershy> -brain esplodes again-
<VioletVanilla> 6Hmmm? Caramel sea ponies? o:
<ValtheJean> NO
<EspyLacopa> They're too adorable to leave behind.
<ValtheJean> BAD VIOLET
<Luna> 07Yahooo
<Dashite> Caramel sea pony?
<Dashite> Someone get on drawing that!
<ValtheJean> >:(
<EspyLacopa> Poor Jagga.
<ValtheJean> I will murder you all
<Fluttershy> no moar sea poniessss.... ><
<VioletVanilla> 6Caramel sea pony, this pleases me <3
<prince-dari> Nooo Gandalf!
<Silverscreen> 11> Panthro
<Silverscreen> 11Did you hear that?
<ValtheJean> HE'D BETTER BE BACK AS A GOOD GUY
<HotCocoa> Hey Cog.
<Silverscreen> 11They actually managed to make ALL of the characters likable. I have yet to witness one that I didn't like.
<CogWeaver> yo
<ValtheJean> I kinda dislike liono and cheetara atm
<Fluttershy> I don't like the evil lizard wizard o-o
<EspyLacopa> Sucks to be Jagga right now.
<Silverscreen> 11Well, that's because Liono has been acting like a complete douche
<AllisZero> How could you like the one with the boobs?
<ValtheJean> just because I have yet to see any character in cheetara other than "standard female character"
<ValtheJean> and Liono...I dunno, he'd better redeem himself soon
<Fluttershy> lizard wizard lizard wizar
<Fluttershy> d
<prince-dari> Don't worry, Gandalf will come back as Gandalf the White.
<Silverscreen> 11VAltheJean: Good point...but on the other hand...BOOBS!
<EspyLacopa> Heh. shoo be doo.
<ValtheJean> I think Dari means Gandalf the Dead :P
<FlutterguyCZ> Hi everypony!
<EspyLacopa> Gandalf doesn't die.
<ValtheJean> lol, I rest my case silverscreen :P
<EspyLacopa> He just becoms Gandalf the White
<LvS> hi there
<GGgala> lolwut at the gala/

<Fluttershy> Yay~ singing

<Fluttershy> Fluttersing for now ^^
<Iks> hmmm i just saw some video showing people playing counterstrike and i flashbacked so hard... i think that game gave me PTSD
<AllisZero> Oh no, this is the episode where the building collapses?
<Barry> that's a new one
<LvS> what's ptsd?
<Barry> Fluttersing
<WhatPayne> Flutterwhatnow?
<Iks> post traumatic stress disorder
<EspyLacopa> No more Thundercats?
<LvS> oh.
<Fluttershy> House!
<Dashite> best verse
<ValtheJean> oh great
<ValtheJean> my internet is dying :-/
<Fluttershy> I see House!
<prince-dari> DASH
<prince-dari> FDSAOPGKASOPDGK
<prince-dari> WOOOOOOOOOOOO
<prince-dari> <33333333
<prince-dari> Best solo
<Dashite> Dash gets fireworks.
<RobotPinkie> induring best pony
<WhatPayne> All solos are best solos
<Fluttershy> Then Pinkie hehe ^^
<Wrek> 05I think prince-dari has a thing for dash, but i am unsure.
<HotCocoa> I think I scared him off with my Simpsons reference.
<Dashite> Dari is such a fanboy.
<VioletVanilla> 6Rainbow pony is best pony Dari? ;D
<prince-dari> MFW the only thing I've ever actually fanboyed about it MLP.
<EspyLacopa> Dashite: I think we're all fanboys/fangirls
<prince-dari> Fucking MLP making me into an annoying prick.
<prince-dari> is*
*Fireant drink HotCocoa
<RobotPinkie> sure, blame MLP :P
<VioletVanilla> 6TO TALK!
<prince-dari> It is MLP's fault.
<prince-dari> :P
<AllisZero> It's ok dari, it's OK
<Fluttershy> But MLP is all about loving and tolerating... D: How can it make you a prick?
<EspyLacopa> 9 days to go. . .
<Dashite> EspyLacopa, to a certain extent. Dari is just worse because he has mod power to back up his fanboy-ness.
<Dashite> :p
<WhatPayne> Twilight's such a nerd
<MrPoniator> You cannibal!... Mind giving me some too?
<HotCocoa> Hey Fireant.
<AllisZero> Fuuu
<GGgala> who's geting burninated now?
*VioletVanilla goes to the gala to gala.
<Dashite> Dammit Trogdor!
<RobotPinkie> i haven't really been much of a fanboy over anything recently except MLP either ,though....
<EspyLacopa> Peasants are getting burninated.
<VioletVanilla> 6One of the firepeople is going to pass out.
<Hat> what show is this one
<Dashite> That one in fact.
<GGgala> ah, the House fakeout intro
<RobotPinkie> oh this is House, isn't it?
<AllisZero> I'm really not a fanboy even for MLP
<VioletVanilla> 6Dat mask~
<Fluttershy> Intro about somebody having problems with body = House xp
<GGgala> dat LeFlour
<FreezeFrame> I'm very chill about my bronydom
<EspyLacopa> heh
<Hat> thanks for all the house shows whoever it is
<WhatPayne> Random LeFlour
<Luna> 07<<
<FreezeFrame> I'll tell people about it, but I won't got YOU MUST WATCH IT
<Barry> That... was... random
<RobotPinkie> well i don't really push my bronydom on anyone
<GGgala> stupid new opening music
<VioletVanilla> 6Ish 'tay Luna~ I thought it was good timing!
<WhatPayne> I don't have anyone to push to
<Silverscreen> 11http://img.ponibooru.org/images/64/64ff9ffb10e5326886e1eadf9d03b770
<FreezeFrame> RobotPinkie: Exactly
<Fluttershy> o-o that makes me think of something evil I did...
<Hat> how can i go to sleep with this on? :p
<VioletVanilla> 6but what if we like this music? o:
<Silverscreen> 11Sea Ponies. :D
<prince-dari> I'm going to guess what will happen this episode.
<FreezeFrame> If they want to watch it, they will, if they don't, they won't
<OhYouFool> Nightmare Moon's taken control of Ponyville and begun the eternal night! http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<Dashite> RobotPinkie, same. There are a few people that I did when I first started watching, but honestly they've brough it up more than I have lately.
<prince-dari> House will make about 3 incorrect diagnoses, before finally making a correct diagnosis.
<HotCocoa> OH SHI--
<Solarstorm> http://i.imgur.com/th1ac.jpg
<Silverscreen> 11...
<EspyLacopa> Awesome pic, Silver.
<ValtheJean> lol
<OhYouFool> ...Because I'm running out of creative means of plugging the marathon
<Silverscreen> 11was that the black guy from CSI????
<RobotPinkie> i remember this episode, I think.... if i do, it's pretty fucked up
<Dashite> House won't make any incorrect diagnoses.
<Dashite> It's all his team.
<Dashite> :p
<prince-dari> House ALWAYS makes incorrect diagnoses.
<Fluttershy> I have a friend who's half-brony. He likes the show, but he refuses to admit he likes it. o-o
<prince-dari> :P
<Wrek> 05ill say 4 incorrect ones then Dari, jstu for competition
<prince-dari> And House will save him just before he dies.
<Silverscreen> 11Fluttershy: Denial is a powerful thing, but give him time.
<EspyLacopa> Ah, the season of Asshole Cop vs Asshole Doctor
<GGgala> i'll say 5.
<Fluttershy> So when he missed the Japanese class we share I drew a picture of Pinkie Pie and posted it on his door saying 'FOOOREEEVEEER'
<HotCocoa> Solarstorm: yeah that's my day in a nutshell.
<VioletVanilla> 6@Dari: House will make the first diagnosis and dismiss it. The patient will get worse, he will do it again. Patient will be near death. House will then have a braingasm and know what to do.
<ValtheJean> damn it silverscreen
<Fluttershy> He hated me ^^
<HotCocoa> Except most of it happens at work.
<ValtheJean> you've convinced me to play hookie
<Silverscreen> 11Why are YOU playing hookie, ValtheJean?
*ValtheJean really wants to see the Hub stream
<Hat> oh no! series finale house gets locked up
<Solarstorm> i wish i could watch pony at work :/
<Fluttershy> It was a big picture of Pinkie Pie too o-o. When he saw it he literally screamed
<ValtheJean> meh, because I don't want to talk about Jane Austen right now
<Dashite> Dammit Hat!
<Silverscreen> 11who?
<ValtheJean> author of various novels
<prince-dari> Who
<ValtheJean> like Pride and Prejudice
<Hat> Did somebody say... Jane Austen?!
<prince-dari> Who?
*Silverscreen 11has an actual reason. He already did the work. :P
<RobotPinkie> oh wow, a diagnostician diagnosing people? wow, the predictions are just amazing!
<ValtheJean> I have a real reason too
<Nittany_Tiger> In college. Can be in chat at school. :p
<ValtheJean> because I'm god damn lazy :P
<Hat> "We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Nittany~ :33
<EspyLacopa> it's Lupus!
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
<Nittany_Tiger> Here lurkin'
<Dashite> Speaking of which, I should probably plug in my laptop to charge before class...
<GGgala> eclat is a word?
<Silverscreen> 11IT'S NEVER LUPUS!!!!
<Silverscreen> 11Where did that come from?
<Luna> 07indeed!
<OhYouFool> Just a reminder, it's an all day marathon, so if you want to join, there's still 9 and a half hours left in the day to join :P
<VioletVanilla> 6I think it is a quote from House himself? o:
<Luna> 07correct ^
<VioletVanilla> 6~yay~
<Fawful> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Fawful!
<Hat> Elizabeth talking to Mr Darcy
<Luna> 07remember the pills he put in the lupus book?
<AllisZero> It was last episode
<AllisZero> He keeps a stack of pills inside a Lupus book
<Rainbow_Dash> Oh crap
<Luna> 07^
<AllisZero> "You keep your pills in a lupus book?"
<AllisZero> House: "It's never lupus"
<WhatPayne> Wasn't that yesterday's episode?
<Luna> 07Yessem

<Hat> he's becoming infected!
<Hat> this guy is off another show
<Hat> hmm
<VioletVanilla> 6Not only is it never Lupus, but House never changes.
<FreezeFrame> House admitting he was wrong?
<VioletVanilla> 6Sudden banhammer? o:
<MrPoniator> Welp, that makes it easier for me for not having to look for a stream too long
<EspyLacopa> FreezeFrame: Of course not.
<Iks> hmm 4pm est... thats 10 pm for most europeons

<FreezeFrame> There's no mibbit exemption

<VioletVanilla> 6;A;
<prince-dari> Bye mibbit people.
<ValtheJean> Luna, are you pausing the stream or is my internet derping?
<WhatPayne> I can sense my turn coming up
<Luna> 07internet derp
<ValtheJean> fuuuuuu-
<Dashite> Bronystate stress test
<FreezeFrame> Espy: Normally there's a limit on simultaneous connections from a single IP
<prince-dari> It's because there's no CGI block for webirc in the unreal section.
<FreezeFrame> And mibbit is a single IP
<HotCocoa> MPR|: it's a synchtube marathon of MLP
<prince-dari> 4 IPs.
<prince-dari> :P
<JackiePie> Hi
<EspyLacopa> See, this is an entirely new reason for preferring a proper chat client.
<MrPoniator> Yo Jackie
<HotCocoa> Hey JackiePie
<Lemon_Lime> Wow o.O
<Dashite> So the only people left are those not using mibbit?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<WhatPayne> That means, I'm safe!
<OhYouFool> Glorious Shadowbolts screentime right now http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<Dashite> Hurrah!
<Lemon_Lime> I was gonna stream MLP episodes, but since there's a marathon already, I don't need to :o
*Luna is safe too
<HotCocoa> Lemon_Lime: eeyup.
<OhYouFool> Hehe~
<HotCocoa> If I weren't at work, I would be watching.
*WhatPayne hugs Luna
<FreezeFrame> Andre the Giant
<Dashite> ^
<MrPoniator> I probably could join in the fun, seeing how I can't think of anything else to do since I'm having this darn flu
*VioletVanilla is safe? o:
<Dashite> Yup
<Luna> 07yep
<OhYouFool> Join the fun
<OhYouFool> Plug it in other places
<WhatPayne> We are the untouchables?

<shadowdemon137> This is interesting.
<Scarlet_Pimponyl> Will "yay" spam be allowed for the stress test?
<scatr> two of them i think
<Metal_Link> Hugh does a good job hiding the fact that he is British in this show.
<Aponymous> So no specific episode? Alright.
<Crisp> Sister, will you accept my FRIENDSHIP
<LunarFrost> no the only cure is sending her to the moon
<wildrory> me too
<Maeni> Quite a shit load o.O
<ValtheJean> 2,14 spam is never allowed. It is against the rules
<Futil1ty> so is the stress test just for the fact of how many viewers their going to have?
<kripto> I WANNA TALK ABOUT NOTHING

<kripto> I want to talk but I don't want to talk
<Crisp> Yes!!!
<mib_1p4iei> HEIL HITLER
<GGgala_> Godwin's? in MY network TV?

<Jenemmy> Hi everyone
<mib_lx1zc2> forever alone

<VioletVanilla> 6Dalies and Mentlegen, the stress test will be starting in approx.. 20 minutes. Thank you.
<kripto> Without reason
<ColeTrain4EVER> The HUB huh? Like that show about puppies. "Secret butt fun" is it?
