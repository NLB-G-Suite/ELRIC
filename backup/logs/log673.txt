<Spectrum_Rush> ya know I remember a time when Sumica was playing KSP and Phase4 entered the chat wondering what was the monstrosity on screen... I think they've switched places XD
<Phase4> XD
<Sumica> 00,10oh I still make them just phas is better at rockets then I am
<Phase4> sumi is much better at planes
<MadSurge> Sumica is better at making explosions :D
<Sumica> 00,10the trick is to not care for the pilots
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Phase4> i lost a lot of speed during that mid launch flip
<Phase4> this may or may not make it
<Phase4> either way its gona be a long burn
<Phase4> i recomend packing a sandvich
<DoctoDoctorWho> Moar Dakka! I mean rocket
<Sumica> 00,10never let things like pilot safty and it's too heavy get in the way of science
<LightTrooper105> im just still waiting for it to land on the moon :P
<Phase4> hmm, only 3 degrees out
<Phase4> not bad for eyeballing it
<Phase4> ok, this will escape kerbin
<Sumica> 00,10made a refined and highly optmistic lander module for the new ToP
<Phase4> protip: mechjeb is useless
<Phase4> XD its acceleration was matched to kerbins for a while there
<Phase4> so i'ma go do some stuff while this burns slowly

<Sumica> 00,10lolwut?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I mean I'm ok with shipping and all, heck I favorite Green in FiMFicition
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sumica: It is widely accepted that the theoretical state of "too much dakka" is physically impossible. This implies that the state of "enough dakka" is equally impossible, as adding any more to "enough" creates "too much". Therefore, there is always room for More Dakka
<DoctoDoctorWho> :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the comments about that scene alone are a joke
<pony_3274> good bye everypony you guys made my first time here magical :3 and lots of fun

<Phase4> IcY_, ?
<Barbetos> I think he means STREAMCEPTI *shot* x_x
<IcY_> ceptionception
<Phase4> var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
<Phase4> ga.async = true; should be ga.async = "true";
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Phase4> true != "true"
<Phase4> whoever wrote this was a php dev and not javascript dev
<Phase4> cause in php true == "true"
<RaveBrony> Couldve foold me
<RaveBrony> *fooled
<RaveBrony> :D
<Jmo> Could've fooled Adam too.

<AdamTheDuck> I only know a little of Visual Basic >.<
<Ponies47> GTG school. Later everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<IcY_> I know VB, too bad its useless :/
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah it is
<Phase4> strange
<Phase4> that did not do what i expected
<Phase4> IcY_, vb is bad language
<Phase4> IcY_, learn python
<IcY_> I only know it because of school
<Phase4> python or ruby, ruby tends to be more 'friendly'
<IcY_> they can choose any language in the course, so they chose the most useless one
<Barbetos> Bye Ponies47
<IcY_> I mean applying the logic to other languages is possible, but I'm not patient enough :P

<IcY_> oh yeah, that science stuff was pretty damn sciencey
<Dken2021> aww, I missed out on some science? dang
<ofna01> Phase, i doubt there will ever be manned mars missions
<ofna01> just doesnt seem likely to me
<Phase4> ofna01, it will happen
<Phase4> just a matter of time
<Dken2021> doesn't it take like a month to get to mars?
<AdamTheDuck> Why not ofna01?
<Phase4> Dken2021, 6 month trip
<Phase4> theres a week wide transfer window every 5(?) years

<ofna01> DUMMKOPS
<Barbetos> Phase4 Por que?
<Phase4> when you screw with physics or input or anything to do with motion
<Phase4> you ADD THE MODS TO THE CLIENT AS WELL
<Phase4> when your testing localy and have zero ping its fine
<Phase4> but when you have a nonzero ping everything breaks
<Phase4> its INCREDIBLY anoying having all these mods where the devs do not care

<Barbetos> There was nothing to see
<Barbetos> By the time phase loaded in it was over
<WallDives> MadSurge! RE6 @_@
<Cypresswolf> :D
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: only two people against Twily
<MadSurge> WallDives: what about it?
<Barbetos> nuuuuhhh!!
<Barbetos> one 111
<Barbetos> lol did some one just say "cheat" ? XD
<WallDives> MadSurge, only played through the first chap of Leon/Helena on Vet. Surprisingly difficult.
<Barbetos> Hello I think you might be new here.

<Barbetos> oh fsk lyra angry!
<MadSurge> WallDives: :O is it out already?
<AdamTheDuck> ._.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Phase4?

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> WallDives: how is RE6 so far? does it control well?
<MadSurge> WallDives: is it as actiony and non-scary as it looked?
<Lyra|beingclever> rawr
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ Tile Mode Is Best Mode!
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: my little changeling, my little changeling, aaaaaahhhhh
<Lyra|atwork> later babes~
<Barbetos> Kind of creepy to imagine what exactly a Changling AJ would do as a job.
<MadSurge> Later Lyra|atwork!
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Lyra|atwork
<Barbetos> Seeing as the normal one harvests apples.
<WallDives> I've only played through Leon/Helena, and we were freaking pretty hard. (we were also drunk). Most controls are OK, lot more freedom, more fluid, but minor control issues.
<MadSurge> Barbetos: buck food for the captives, of course
<Cypresswolf> gonna have to go back outside and start clearing the metal pipe O_o
<Cypresswolf> eventually
<Dken2021> Cypresswolf I'm gonna expect that there's already a fanfic for those changelings there
<Cypresswolf> :) If you find a good one, let me know
<Lil_B> hello everyone :)
<Barbetos> MadSurge still creepy.
<Dken2021> hai Lil_B
<Cypresswolf> Hi Lil_B
<Barbetos> Hiya Lil_B !
<MadSurge> Barbetos: but I love creepy :3

<Barbetos> Remember that kids
<Cypresswolf> There's a new Two Best Sisters Play: Resident Evil 4 <3_<3

<Barbetos> Cypresswolf I go to look and all the you tube bronies I follow pretty much already faved and liked
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Cypresswolf: lol you'll laugh your flank off :D
<Cypresswolf> Do they all stay up late waiting for stuff like that O_o
<Cypresswolf> Equestria Daily posted the news about it at 2:40 am
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well im goin 2 bed :) hopefully i can get back to sleeping normal today :D
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Ske-gone
<Barbetos> Cypresswolf its always morning/afternoon some where
<Cypresswolf> :D No Stream? Press A to throw self out window
<DaringDerpy> hello
<Barbetos> Anyways timez for works. And to answer question, yes. Staying up 18 to 24 hours of awake time followed by 6 hours of sleep is the best.
<Barbetos> To bad I can't do that crap any more
<Dken2021> hello DaringDerpy
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Barbetos
*Rain 's bronystate log is so big that it cant be oppened....
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DaringDerpy
<Lil_B> Rain that's good ... I guess ... means we communicate a lot :P
<Rain> its over 9 months old x3
<ofna01> i got the game yesterday and my car is already an R2 6_9
<Rain> and it is 5 times larger than any of my other logs (not joking)
<DaringDerpy> they removed amy and rorry from the show?
<ofna01> what show
<DaringDerpy> dr who
<Jmo> lol rorry
<RoboGerbil> wasnt the latest season supposed to be the dr and river?
<Rain> Doctor is part of his name. its not a title ><
<Rain> Doctor Who. =/= Dr. Who
<DaringDerpy> but he has jesus like healing powers
<ofna01> wow
<ofna01> my Skyline is an R3 :P
<Rain> only for himself, DaringDerpy :p
<RoboGerbil> no stream?
<AdamTheDuck> RoboGerbil, nope
<AdamTheDuck> Just enjoy the buffer show~
<RoboGerbil> quick post ponies www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zbGFGQTq0
<rdash> Lol
<DaringDerpy> http://chainsawsuit.com//comics/20120613.png
<Rain> xD
<rdash> I don't get that comic...
<rdash> He just wakes up and "thinks" he's a brony?
<rdash> Dafuq...?
<DaringDerpy> he lies in bed and realizes that he is one of them
<rdash> Ah...
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59739LrJfYE
<Rain> there we go
<DaringDerpy> so it was different for you, rdash?
<Rain> deleted every single log for bronystate
<Rain> because I honestly dont give a crap about those old memories.
<rdash> DaringDerpy: what do you mean?
<Rain> they certianly are no help to me now and would only cause me personal issues :3
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HudCIt-AuvE
<DaringDerpy> rdash: how you got into all this here
<rdash> DaringDerpy: eh, for me personally, I
<rdash> Really became a brony because I decided one day just to sit down and watch the show
<Dken2021> RoboGerbil ah, a pretty good sparta mix
*Octovler is trying to think of an OC in order to reaffirm his broniness.
<rdash> I had heard so much about it, and decided, ya know what there has to be something behind all this hype online
<MadSurge> Aww Rain, is everything alright? :(
<rdash> So I watched a few episodes, and immediately my inner child poked though and I felt happy with watching the show \o/
<DaringDerpy> this just made you someone who watched the show, rdash
<RoboGerbil> Dken2021: i thought it could be better but its the only one on youtube
<DaringDerpy> now you are on bronystate :P
<DaringDerpy> the new season starts on november. all bronyness will be restored then.
<rdash> Oh yes, definitely
<rdash> I can't wait ^_^
<Octovler> after 1.5 years being a brony gets ol… oh ;-;
<AdamTheDuck> I hope season 3 can inspire more music again :<
<DaringDerpy> I will complain about every single episode on ponychan ^^
<AdamTheDuck> Right now all my favourite artists hardly upload anything new anymore....
<DaringDerpy> season 1 will never come again
<Octovler> I will complain about how corporate this new season will be
<rdash> >implying TheLivingTombstone, WoodenToaster, and all the other awesome brony artists aren't pumping out music at least once a week...
<AdamTheDuck> I don't listen to them
<rdash> Awwwww, you should...
<AdamTheDuck> Well WoodenToaster yes, but mostly the remixes
<DaringDerpy> but the first year of the fandom produced the most material
<DaringDerpy> most culture
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: we still might get awesomeness though :$
<rdash> "Culture"...
<DaringDerpy> some of the old projects and websites are defunct now
<DaringDerpy> I hope so, MadSurge
<DaringDerpy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEc-BZaPGA8 this musician has some talent
<DaringDerpy> :)
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: You might have noticed, I tend to see the glass always half full :)
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, hehe I love Dissonace :3
<AdamTheDuck> ance*
<AdamTheDuck> Gotta love that laugh at 2:40ish :3
<DaringDerpy> MadSurge: optimists exist so people like me can tell them "I told you so"
<DaringDerpy> the laugh is great
<AdamTheDuck> Half full, half empty, I like to see it as there is 125 ml of water.
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: and we exist to tell you "see? Everything went better than you expected" :P
<DaringDerpy> and then I call you a communist :P
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, you listened to his steampunk'd works? :3
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: :D that's CCCP silly
<AdamTheDuck> Assuming it's a he.
<DaringDerpy> no, not at all. he wrote under the youtube post this were his first attempt in electronic material
<Kandarihu> Octovler, what do you mean by "corporate"?
<DaringDerpy> MadSurge: :)
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, Warriors of the Balloon is... nice too :3
<AdamTheDuck> Strangly lovely.
<AdamTheDuck> Orchestral with a deep bass is ftw
<Octovler> Kandarihu: When its clear that selling new toys comes first. Crystal Ponies and more Cadance.
<AdamTheDuck> Where is the Octavia toys? :<
<AdamTheDuck> All I want is Octavia...
<DaringDerpy> I have an octavia figure on my desk. It's my only pony toy
<Kandarihu> Octovler, okay. That's what I know as "toyetic". Is that how you see Transformers Beast Wars?
<killerpony7733> Octovler Oi that's S3 speculation
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: and then you'll put her with the Vynil toy :D
<RoboGerbil> www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dva7MjGnCpw
<Octovler> Togetic? I like that pokemon.
<Octovler> Somehow, I missed Beast Wars entirely what channel was it on?
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mabgvkoyLw Yay for steampunk \:3/
<Meanwhile> Hello everyone.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Meanwhile
<Dken2021> Octovler I think it was on fox
<Dken2021> hey Meanwhile
<Kandarihu> Octovler, it was best in syndication. Fox Kids censored it.
<DaringDerpy> warriors of the balloon is...different
<Meanwhile> Chat moving at the speed of snail again?
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, strange, won't you say? :D
<Octovler> I don't know how I missed that show entirely. You sure it wasn't on cable?
<Kandarihu> Let me tell you this: Beast Wars was toyetic done right.
<Kandarihu> Octovler, it was mainly on Broadcast TV
<DaringDerpy> not the kind of music I usually hear, AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, yeah it's very different
<AdamTheDuck> but worked well when I was killing zombies in Killing Floor XD
<Kandarihu> It was streamed a few months ago.
<Octovler> As long as all the current ponies aren't killed by Unicron followed by a G5 of ponies. (How is Transformers an A movie?)
<Phase4> Octovler, transformers is A due to budget
<Phase4> is otherwise shit movie
<DaringDerpy> we watch ghostbusters next weekend? :)
<DaringDerpy> good
<Octovler> 5 million, cult hit. It's straight up B
<DaringDerpy> transformers is one of these cheap 20 minute commercials for cheap plastic dolls
<Phase4> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403703/ this is news to me
<AdamTheDuck> rdash, yeah, I just find Wooden Toaster's remixes so much better, but it's just personal taste. :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsI1lgTwdMw
<Phase4> Octovler, which transformers? i thought we ment the michael bay movie
<Phase4> havent seen the catoon one
<Kandarihu> The simple goodness of Beast Wars is that they got some good writers lined up, gave them character designs and just turned them loose. It's still a 30 minute commercial. But it's one of those GOOD commercials, in 30 minute chunks with nearly full continuity.
<Phase4> beast wars is excelent
<Octovler> The cartoon 80s movie is the one Mods are saying is A.
<DaringDerpy> AdamTheDuck: I miss some structure in this piece of music. Guess you have to be a musician to get interested
<Phase4> Octovler, http://www.bronystate.net/faq/ it either was critically aclaimed or had a reletively high budget
<DaringDerpy> mods are silly fillies
<AdamTheDuck> Then enjoy one more sone DaringDerpy before I sleep :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIwV23ta3I
<Octovler> http://derpy.me/Ix9JW Man, if this card existed at the time. This week's B movie would be 5 minutes long.
<AdamTheDuck> Good night everyone :P
<Kandarihu> Would an anime movie that was critically acclaimed qualify as an A movie?
<Dken2021> night AdamTheDuck
<DaringDerpy> AdamTheDuck: I think I heard this one quite often on internet radio stations
<Phase4> Octovler, no, they'de just get more card games done in the same timeslot
<AdamTheDuck> Oh is it? I don't listen to pony radios often~
<DaringDerpy> AdamTheDuck: hm...not this version
<Dken2021> Kandarihu if you can somehow get the budget for it and see how wel it did, probably, otherwise, it's a B
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, "Orchestral Version" :P
<DaringDerpy> AdamTheDuck: yes, I see
<Octovler> heh, that Pudding isn't even my strongest card
<Phase4> Octovler, i seem to be disagreeing with you a lot, this cannot be allowed to pass
*Phase4 hugs Octovler
<DaringDerpy> It's very easy to overload an orchestra
<AdamTheDuck> Seems so, that's why I like ApplejackTheEngineer's version :3
<DaringDerpy> I think I prefer the original
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Jfctt1b8o
<AdamTheDuck> nuuuuu
*Octovlerfest hugs Phase4
<ofna01> nuuuuu
<Octovlerfest> At least Pokemon the movie has a decent budget and huge box office returns
<AdamTheDuck> This one is more of a change then a direct orchestral remix
<AdamTheDuck> than*
<DaringDerpy> sounds good so far
<Kandarihu> A while ago, I used to vote for One Piece Movie 10: Strong World as an A Movie.
<Crystaline_Shard> Da'wwwwww Zerna fell asleep at the comp that's cute wish i had a web cam :/ morning everypony
<Octovlerfest> (Hmm, Super or Brick for B movie…)
<Meanwhile> I bet chat during the movie will be nothing but "you activated my trap card"
<AdamTheDuck> alright, off to sleep now for realsies. :3
<AdamTheDuck> Bye~
<DaringDerpy> good morning Crystaline_Shard

*Hoody|School intercepts spinach

<SKZR|Writing> I've been here for a while.
<SKZR|Writing> (as WallDives)
<Zuxxez123> SKZR|Writing: been a sneaky ninja...

<Zuxxez123> That's the best sight to hide in.
<Dken2021> mmm, this apple butter is great on oatmeal , yum
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY_3uxzkoV4

<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I LOVED this show. :D
<Wirisme> that... exists?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Malavolent :)
<Cypresswolf> Hello Malavolent
<Zuxxez123> That Pete n Pete...
<Dken2021> pretty nice, all I know is, probably gonna buy some more
<Dken2021> hai Malavolent
<Malavolent> So... what will we do until the november comes?
<Cypresswolf> Who remembers this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WDjJOSCxyw
<SKZR|Writing> drink and do papers.
<Dken2021> I'll be catching up on breaking bad
<Cypresswolf> I saw the latter seasons before the show ended - loved it though :)
<Zuxxez123> I think I'll be checking out Breaking Bad also. But I know I'll be feeling like a bandwagoner. xD
<Cypresswolf> The last intro at 1:38 is the one I remember
<Dken2021> and it appears i'm lagging due to network problems, ugh
<Dken2021> brb
<The_Engineer> Hi everypony :) Engineer is here ;D?
<Dken2021> hai The_Engineer
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, The_Engineer :)
<Wirisme> hi The_Engineer
<Zuxxez123> Hello The_Engineer how's it going?
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Qj0xKvwGM - :)
<The_Engineer> Anyone wanna see my...art?
<The_Engineer> Its my first time drawing a pony
<The_Engineer> ^^
<Zuxxez123> Sure The_Engineer
<Zuxxez123> I'd love to see it.
<The_Engineer> Its a base of fluttershy
<The_Engineer> of a photo I saw
<The_Engineer> I'm finishing the tail now :)
<Zuxxez123> :)
<Zuxxez123> How long have you been working on it?
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I love it. Wish I could've lived in the 80s.
<The_Engineer> Hmmm I worked on it yesterday for a few minutes
<Cypresswolf> I have more where that came from :) 1 moment
<The_Engineer> right now I think 20 because I suck at tail drawing
<The_Engineer> :P
<Malavolent> Cypresswolf: That sounds wrong.
<The_Engineer> Anyway heres the link of the base of it: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8esm83LO1ri5dh4o1_1280.jpg
<Zuxxez123> The_Engineer: I suck at drawing in general. (Maybe I should use the circle outline things...)
<The_Engineer> Its my first time so I might have bad accidents etc etc.
<Cypresswolf> Malavolent: dont judge til I post it :P
<Kinixys> HI!
<The_Engineer> Hi Kinixys
<Malavolent> Cypresswolf: No, I mean that sentence.
<JunkerKun> Kinixys: Hey
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Kinixys! :)
<Zuxxez123> Hi Kinixys what's up?
<Dken2021> hey Kinixys
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MknqHQYniuI
<The_Engineer> So what do you guys thing of my first pony drawing so far :) ?
*Zuxxez123 runs up and glomps Kinixys
<Cypresswolf> Cinemark policy trailers were AWESOME! I loved going to the movies just to see those ^)^
<Cypresswolf> ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> The_Engineer: It's nice. :)
<Malavolent> The_Engineer: I'll be honest with ya. While the head looks ok, the body shape and legs do not. I think you should start with pony drawing tutorials, rather than drawing them from scratch.
<The_Engineer> Meh
<The_Engineer> I didnt draw fropm scratch
<The_Engineer> I tried copying one
<The_Engineer> of the internets :P
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Oh the 80s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xSyVjkSib4
<Malavolent> Yeah, that's what I meant, basically.
<Cypresswolf> I like the blue cat trio more than Front Row Joe
<The_Engineer> K
*Kinixys hugs Zuxxez123!
<The_Engineer> Dont expect me to be a goo--BRB Phone call
<The_Engineer> I need to get food now
*The_Engineer is now afk.
<Zuxxez123> The_Engineer: Try using this as a tutorial, I did the same thing as you. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blG244JdZ9U
<Zuxxez123> Lol, my great timing at work ladies and gentlemen...
<AJIsAwesome> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: Wendy's actually did this? :S
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Yes.
<Kinixys> Thx for the warm welcome.
<SKZR|Writing> training video?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> The first Wendys I technically worked at had those videos still
<SKZR|Writing> havent touched the link, but I'm assuming.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> That was around 2003 or so
<SKZR|Writing> yep. Training vid.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> On VHS
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Awww yeaaah
<weeping_pegasi82> http://hyperion1997.deviantart.com/#/d5gmdp1 no tutorials used :$
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Zuxxez123> That VHS copy! :3
<Malavolent> weeping_pegasi82: Cute :D
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: That's very nic.
<AJIsAwesome> *nice
<Zuxxez123> weeping_pegasi82: That's pretty awesome. I wish I had natural artist talent. But atlas...
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Invi> moin everypony ^^
<Wirisme> ^^^
<AJIsAwesome> Morning, Invi! :)
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUoH5kUIVfg - this was my favorite Cinemark Policy video
<Wirisme> Although if I actually put some work into it I might get better
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Wish they played this in movie theaters today.
<Invi> Cypresswolf, wat?
<Cypresswolf> IKR! The last policy video was in 1997
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<killerpony7733> Sometimes skill comes more naturally to come, but many others need to practice it'll probably take longer but you'll still improve
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTn00lSAKg0 - this on aired through 98
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> On the hub right now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L142_juksw8
<Invi> wait, is that a real cinema intermission?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Oh and yeah, having the DirectV display at work on the Hub is awesome
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> For the most part
<Invi> what is a directV display?
*AJIsAwesome is now AFL
<AJIsAwesome> *AFK
<Cypresswolf> I prefer the original policy videos with the Blue Cat Trio - Front Roe Joe's voice doesnt have that energy. Once Cinemark went cg with their videos, the animation quatlity wasnt as good
<JunkerKun> Cypresswolf: So, what is it exactly? Movie theater commercial?
<Invi> ^
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Invi We just have a tv set up with a directv reciever, to show customers.
<Kinixys> Cypresswolf: Thank you for sharing.
<Invi> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH, oh awesome :D
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I just leave it on the HUB XD The "family friendly" chanell
<Cypresswolf> They were Theatre policy videos for Cinemark 1988-1997
<Cypresswolf> Kinixys: Your Welcome
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> The funny thing about those videos is that they are still sort of around
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I remember seeing that cat in a 3d render before
<Kinixys> Front Row Joe. XD
<Crystaline_Shard> NOW IZ EPIC COOKING TIME!
*The_Engineer is back
<The_Engineer> Hi everyone
<The_Engineer> I'm backy
<Invi> hi The_Engineer ^^
<Kinixys> wb engie.
<Zuxxez123> Welcome backy The_Engineer
<Crystaline_Shard> Oh awesome it's Engi! and i just referanced heavy.
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I dun care what anyone says. I like Gilda.
<JunkerKun> Cypresswolf: Hmm... never seen one before. We don't have these
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> inb4 some one kills me. XD
<Cypresswolf> I wish I could remember the price of a movie ticket when I was a kid - having never bought one myself until Jr High when I was allowed to go to the movies without adult supervision
<Kinixys> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: What do you like about Gilda?
<Cypresswolf> what other old stuff can I dig up...
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> She throws an interesting dynamic that needed to be in MLP FiM. not everyone is a nice friendshipful being in equestria
<DeadpoolDash> i remember when movie tickets cost $4.00
<Cypresswolf> I remember some animations - I think Nickelodeon used to play in the late 80's to early 90's
<The_Engineer> Anyone wanna watch me stream anythin?
<Cypresswolf> One of which was of a man in a yellow shirt sitting down to a breakfast of an egg on a stand, when he's about to crack the shell, he gets a knock at the door...
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> She shows a bit of why RD likes her so much too, when she is not being a dick to ponies. Granted that only last like 5 minutes.
<Kinixys> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: I see, for contrast. So you like Gilda cause she makes the friendships that do exist more meaningful?
<DeadpoolDash> Gilda was awesome
<Cypresswolf> The man in yellow goes to answer it, but only sees a heavy snow outside, frusterated he goes back to his egg, he gets another knocking sound - this time some ceiling dust falls down
<Kinixys> Cypresswolf: Oh I've seen that one.
<Cypresswolf> the knocking continues, each time his house crushes inward, until he is crushed - the camera zoomed out to reaveal
<Cypresswolf> A man in yellow, sitting at the table with a crushed egg on a stand
<Cypresswolf> I've been looking for that cartoon for years, but without the name of it or animator, I havent found it
<AJIsAwesome> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: I agree. It's nice to know that not everyone in the MLP:FIM universe isn't friendly and kind.
<AJIsAwesome> Adds more flavor and depth into the world itself.
<The_Engineer> Hey
<The_Engineer> AJIsAwesome:
<AJIsAwesome> Yes?
<The_Engineer> Do you want towatch me stream :)?
<DeadpoolDash> the entire Gilda episode was all about trolling
<AJIsAwesome> Why do you ask?
<The_Engineer> Idk I just want somkeone to watch me ;c
<AJIsAwesome> Well, I'm not sure. I have homework to do.
<The_Engineer> FOREVER ALONE. Ghost is with his family and I'm in my house with no one :c

<Zuxxez123> Invi: I watched Follow the Sun; followed by that cartoon. Interesting morning I have having. xD

<The_Engineer> Its name is TCR Engineer
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> 1-2 whole months and then only 13 episodes until MLP goes away
<Cypresswolf> Anyone ever see a cartoon - perhaps about 30 minutes - about a family of 4 who adopts a little white dog. has its black round nose floating - not attached to its muzzle - the children are brats...
<The_Engineer> and this is his cujtie mark
<The_Engineer> http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/50512_119524058167057_318271767_n.jpg
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> no season 4
<The_Engineer> and hes meant to be happy
<The_Engineer> :P
<Sonny> ok hold on
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> thought if I got a tablet more people would commission and I'd be able to save money for $1000 eye surgery in December
<Sonny> give me a while :D can't promise it'll be done today tough :D I might get more commissions ^^
<Sonny> Well, gotta work be back later ^^
<Kinixys> Never seen that Cypresswolf.
<Cypresswolf> Burglars break in while the family are out and the dog doesnt deter them and lets them rob the place - family sends the dog to military training - and the family is a bit afraid of the dog at first - dont remember the rest - but it ends with the father being locked outside at night and finds a way in only to be mistaken as a burglar by the newly trained dog
<Kinixys> Thanks for the link to the pony generator. It's got a lot of options.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> read Mark of Athena today

<Applejack2012> good evening
<sonicandmario85> and then i get kicked

<Chrysalis> cupcakes, rp, all caps
<RaveBrony> No biggie
<Chrysalis> take your pick as to why you got kicked
<RaveBrony> Very true
<Malavolent> Roleplay, srs bsns.
<Meanwhile> I've never believed in "x is right because they're the one with the big hat"
<VenHur> We don't want roleplays here and deffinetly no Cupcakes!
<RaveBrony> Yeah, you obviously have to go with the guy with the More Expensive hat! :$
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: regardless thats how it is in most cases :D
<Chrysalis> even when they are wrong though
<Chrysalis> they do have the big hat
<Meanwhile> You are wrong, I will tell you you're wrong, I will tell you why you're wrong, and at the end of the day I will take pride in the fact that I had the stones to tell you so.
<VenHur> ^ What.
<sonicandmario85> im close to leaving bronystate forever
<Chrysalis> and then you lose your job/house/account
<AJIsAwesome> What's going on this time?
<Alchemist> lets plan a coup d'état
<VenHur> sonicandmario85: :(

<RaveBrony> AJIsAwesome: I dont even know :D
<sonicandmario85> besides i was only fucking joking
<Malavolent> VenHur: Basically, he doesn't care who is wrong, he is going to kick everyone's flank. Or something like that.
<RaveBrony> Dat mouth
<Chrysalis> im sorry whos the one with a degree, a decent job and a house?
<sonicandmario85> how was i suposed to know that was rp?

<AJIsAwesome> Panda: IKR? :S
<BladedWings> Panda: i just as lost as you are :D
<Panda> someone complaining about leaving b state and Chrysalis and Meanwhile fighting?
<sonicandmario85> as soon as i joined i said HELLO IM PINKIE PIE AND IM GOING TO MURDER YOU
<ekips> sonicandmario85 dude, you got only kicked, big deal. it's a warning that you shouldn't do what you have done
<killerpony7733> Panda Yep i would have the same reaction
<VenHur> Malavolent: I know that, it's just that i'm not as serious sometimes like the rest of you guys, i'm just a silly laid back brony.
<Alchemist> sonicandmario85: it was just a kick, no biggie
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: Well, since I'm living in financial decline, can afford about a meal a day, and can't find work. Probably you.
<Malavolent> VenHur: Well in that case carry on :D
*Panda sighs
<RaveBrony> You were kicked. I was kicked Plenty of times when i first came here. You learn more after each kick :D

<sonicandmario85> i did read the rules
<RaveBrony> Of course, most of the kicks were for a laugh.
<sonicandmario85> it didnt say anything about joking
<sonicandmario85> ):<
<Panda> besides kicks are nothing....
<RaveBrony> Wrek and his "Kicked for having low dps".... that was great :D
<VenHur> DO WANT! ...but i don't have a lots of bits...
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85 Oh right and how is a mod supposed to know through the internet?
<Panda> if you get banned on the other hand, then you have reason to complain.
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: yeah, don't feel like saying much now do you.
<killerpony7733> Panda Not really if he sets himself up for it over and over again
<BladedWings> sonicandmario85: just calm down, so you got kicked...get over it a learn from the mistake...thats life

<VenHur> So much better than the english dub intro!
<Wirisme> I prob missed a bunch
<Ponyloverforever> is this pokemon???
<Invimon> ekips, and the story gets surprisingly good ^^
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: THERE IS NO COMPARISON
<Ponyloverforever> this isnt the pokemon theme

<ekips> never watched it completely though
<Invimon> Ponyloverforever, Digimon
<Dark92Enigma> OOOOOOOOOOOH MYYYYYYYYYYY LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE

<Ponyloverforever> digimon?? did somone did a show mixed with pokemon?
<Meanwhile> Oh yes, the strange giant cactus with boxing gloves.
<Dark_Horst> Ponyloverforever: no
<Dken2021> pocket monsters =/= digital monsters

<VenHur> Oh, this episode...

<Dark_Horst> no
<Ponyloverforever> so pokemon copyed this show then?

<ekips> has Detective Conan been streamed yet?
<Dken2021> I think pokemon came first
<Meanwhile> Mega_Milk: In the event you need to make something look slightly more intimidating, add boxing gloves.
<Dark_Horst> Ponyloverforever: dont know. i think the pokemon thing is older. but digimon always had the better show. witha ctual story
<Dark_Horst> also, these can talk
<Sumica> 00,10Oh dear, I am hearing rumors of a springer ep with bronys.
<Sumica> 00,10this wont end well

<AJIsAwesome> Mozdoc: Possessed.
<Meanwhile> Kencolt: That's not grey.
<Sumica> 00,10the green maned one is mine Chrysalis.
<Rain> my mane is almost white
<Wirisme> possessed
<Chrysalis> its been far too long since i looked at peoples ocs
<Dark92Enigma> Sora!
<Dken2021> Mozdoc it's been hit with a dark gear, which makes it evil
<VenHur> What I missed?
<Chrysalis> ahh ok
<Chrysalis> so sumica is new favourite streamer
<Chrysalis> but Shizuka is damn cute
<Mega_Milk> Sumica's silly dancing poneh
<AJIsAwesome> Stab the sigil- I mean pull the gear!
<Sumica> 00,10indeed she is
<MadSurge> IT'S A FLYING HORSE, HOW HARD CAN IT BE
<Kencolt> Besides, in anime, and games-- this being from both-- since when does any name have to make sense?
<Dark92Enigma> DAT BIG BROTHER
<Meanwhile> Jyou you sure are a stupid bugger.
<Sumica> 00,10joe has no y or u in it
<Chrysalis> oh god

<MadSurge> DED
<Mega_Milk> Wow so thats what kinda show this is
<Chrysalis> i prefer the english songs for these
<Mega_Milk> A dragon ball z kind.
<AJIsAwesome> Mega_Milk: Pretty much. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: Agreed.
<MadSurge> Noooo, let the kid die!
<taoumi> and while you were digivolveing he went splat
<Dark92Enigma> I prefer the japanese BGM
<Sumica> 00,10english?
<Mega_Milk> Were yelling triggers EVERYTHING
<Dken2021> with the power of love!
<Lil_B> MadSurge it's a Level obove the other Digimon, that black wheel is rerally embedded in this backsite :/
<Wirisme> dat filler
<Chrysalis> they use the opening tune for digivolution
<Chrysalis> much better
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<taoumi> xD
<Dark92Enigma> Suddenly DEJA VU
<Meanwhile> No Joe don't be a hero!
<Bronysith> hello taoumi
<Chrysalis> wait, wat
<Dken2021> suddenly englishj
<AJIsAwesome> NYAAAAAHHHH
<Mega_Milk> Suddenly english -lol
<Chrysalis> dual-language?
<Agrold> wait what english?
<Dark92Enigma> WITH ENGLISH DUB!!?????
<Vordox> Oh lol Sumi :D
<Sumica> 00,10dual audio
<taoumi> hallo. i finished the alicorn patern
<Wirisme> did I just learn Japanese?
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica: you so random
<Vordox> SO MUCH DUBBING FAILURE
<Meanwhile> TARDIS translation circuits engaged.
<Bronysith> taoumi: awesome
<VenHur> English dub with english subtitles...seems legit.
<Chrysalis> see, that musics MUCH better
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I mean, shooting at a flying horse, it's a pretty big target
<Ponyloverforever> they have english dub?
<Chrysalis> also, ikakumon sounds badass
<Invimon> why did the laguage swap? I dislike that digivolving theme :<
<Vordox> Chrysalis: <.< No
<Agrold> it must be my tardis cookie jar that let's me translate this I guess...
<Dark_Horst> not really
<Meanwhile> Better voice at any rate.
<Kencolt> The dub may be far from exact, but it has much the same sense.
<Lil_B> suddenly... english background score :| ... it's not bad, but the original is better balanced
<Mega_Milk> I love how his voice sounds like a woman immitating a man -lol
<MadSurge> Translating these names? SURELY YOU JEST
<Sumica> 00,10enough of that =p
<Invimon> and back :D
<Agrold> suddenly japanese again
<Ponyloverforever> aw :<
<Dark92Enigma> Chrysalis: i don't mean to be a jerk, but i grew up with the original BGM, though the english one isn't that bad
<Dken2021> and back to singinh BG
<Vordox> Sumica: Thank you, that dub hurts my ears.
*Invimon is pleased by this
<Lil_B> ^
<Dark_Horst> grew up with the german dub, which came directly from the japanes original. so i do prefer the japanese over the english
<Chrysalis> yeah
<Chrysalis> i grew up on the english dub
<Dark_Horst> sounds way better
<Chrysalis> for like, 6 years
<Chrysalis> on cartoon network
<Vordox> Sumica: It's like watching the English version of Tengen. XD
<Sumica> 00,10I watched english so this is a nice change
<Applejack2012> grew up with Germand Danish dub
<Applejack2012> and
<Dken2021> I've only watch up to the second adventure
<Maid_RainBow> they dont make animes like this anymore
<Dark92Enigma> Dken2021: same here
<Applejack2012> I only watched the first episodes
<Kurra> I dunno. The aesthetic of Digimon still doesn't appeal to me.
<Vordox> Sumica: Seen That dude in Suede's latest Pokemon Review? :D
<Maid_RainBow> Digimon season 1 and 02 where the best
<Chrysalis> voices seem a bit better in the japanese overall. but the score seems much better in the english
<Lil_B> I'm with Dark_Horst thgey< really did a great job woith the german dub back then
<Mega_Milk> So the seal is the bad ass of the group? Of course. Not the T rex. Nope. The seal.
<Wirisme> taichi tachi
<Dark92Enigma> Oh this theme..........
<MadSurge> OH NO, A SEA
<Sumica> 00,10sorry no english opening though
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: definately
<Sumica> 00,10both tracks use butterfly
<Invimon> Lil_B, I like how they named Takeru just TK ^^
<Dken2021> Sumica good, rather not hear that
<Dark92Enigma> I imagine wearing sunglasses while listening to this............<3
<Chrysalis> awwww

<Chrysalis> ohai TGAPT
<Applejack2012> hi
<Invimon> hi everypony who joined ^^
<Kencolt> Ipersonally always likes S3-- Tamers-- the best. It was kind of quirkier, and in a strange way more eralistic.
<Dken2021> hay TGaPT
<lunashy> WTF ok
<Kencolt> *realistic.
*Dark92Enigma wears sunglasses while listening to this......
<Lil_B> Devimon had an amazing voice actor in germany, same guy as Dr. House, Tons opf bad guys anbd narriator in countless Documentarys
<Dark92Enigma> Kurra: it's ok
<Dark_Horst> what i can say is that the english dub of this seems a lot better than the one of tamers. there they jsut utterly raped it
<Invimon> Kencolt, that was when i stopped watching it
<BladedWings> Lil_B: i liked Myotismon's VA
<Michael> hai everypony! :$
<Dark92Enigma> I LOVE YOU...........
<Dark92Enigma> I wish........
<Maid_RainBow> Lil_B : i have to agree on that
<Wirisme> I didn't watch past adventure 1
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Michael :)
<Lil_B> and voice of the new oipening of Castlevania X Chronicles for the PSP XD
<Bronysith> FUCKING HELL
<MadSurge> YOU'RE NOT TWILIGHT, you can't wish!
<Meanwhile> Hey Sumica the Springer bit is on youtube. You should stream it.
<Lil_B> hi Michael :)
<Kurra> I wish Tenchi Muyo was around still. Back in the day, I looked like him. But that's not WHY I watched the series, heh.
<Dark_Horst> . after that, it went downhilltamers was awesome too
<Dark_Horst> whoops
<Dark_Horst> i jumbled something
*Michael hugs AJIsAwesome Lil_B
<Ponyloverforever> yay
<Dark_Horst> well yeah, tamers was pretty much the last good season
<Michael> love the opening
<Chrysalis> english opening
<Maid_RainBow> Sumica : Please next digi venture
<Chrysalis> <3
<Sumica> 00,10there
<VenHur> Now enligh dub...
<Dark92Enigma> WHA______:D
<BladedWings> whoo
<MadSurge> Pffffft, a Red Arima digimon?!
<Ponyloverforever> ?
*Chrysalis marries Sumica
<Meanwhile> Digimon Garlic Champions.
<Dark_Horst> and THIS is CRAP
<Dken2021> sure, why not
<Meanwhile> Never unheard that.
*Dark92Enigma 's brain has fallen
<SafariMonkey> Any luck Saturn?
<Sumica> 00,10it's just the openings
<Invimon> that opening isn that bad, but have to admit it kills every epicness in a battle
<Ponyloverforever> woah this theme song this isnt calming at all like the chinese version
<Bronysith> i cant believe springer would stoop that low
<ekips> and suddenly I feel bad for all those who had to endure this during their childhood
<Bronysith> owait
<Dark92Enigma> Gotta admit it's catchy
<Bronysith> yes i can
<Wirisme> :(
<Lil_B> ... seriously? that is the english opening? that doesn't even sound like a coherent song :/
<Wirisme> ikr
<Dark92Enigma> PAINFULLY CATCHY
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<VenHur> Japanese openings > English openings.
<Michael> oh g2
<Dken2021> Bronysith he's springer, he's hit low ever since he changed his show form something intellectual to white trash tv
<Kurra> That drill dude was pretty spiff though c|
<VenHur> Besides, the first three seasons used the SAME FREAKING song!
<MadSurge> WAIT. The wimpy looking devil is the villain?
<Chrysalis> VenHur why change a song thats so badass
<Bronysith> Dken2021: he hired an actor to play as a brony and made us look like huge fags
<Kencolt> Tamers dub has this kind of punkish backbeat to it's opening...
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: i rather listen to PIG POWER IN THE HOUSE
<Lil_B> VenHur really? the 3rd too?
<Chrysalis> although, screw dna digivolving
<Kurra> Wimpy looking devil YES AHAHA couldn't have said it better myself XD
<VenHur> Lil_B: Yup.
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: yep
<Sumica> 00,10such a varaity of themes
<AJIsAwesome> IKR? :D
<VenHur> Altough the third one used a more punk-ish feel.
<Sylandest> XD
<Meanwhile> Creative bunch aren't they.
<Sylandest> we're so creative
<MadSurge> Kurra: anything with tattered wings is not strong imo :D
<Wirisme> lyrical genius
<Kurra> looking back on these intros, each one is trying to make itself look more historic than the invasion of Normandy.
<Lil_B> >.<
<Dken2021> oh look, they changed some of the lyrics
<ekips> make it stop ;_;
<Applejack2012> that epic intro
<Sumica> 00,10and then this travisty
<Chrysalis> and suddenly
<Chrysalis> shite
<Michael> lawl
<taoumi> and this is where it went to poop
<Chrysalis> although
<Mega_Milk> Digimon OP
<VenHur> Suddently, this opening!
<Sylandest> :D
<Chrysalis> the lyrics are horrifically catchy
<Chrysalis> but the music :(
<Vordox> OH MAI NEW THEME
<Lil_B> ... Leb deinen Traum, denn er wird wahr... :'(
<MadSurge> Oh, it's that fox monster thing
<Kurra> Like honestly, they're trying to be bigger than the Beatles trying to be bigger than Jesus.
<Dark92Enigma> I never EVER listened to this one
<Ponyloverforever> :O
<taoumi> sudenly the horible digimon
<Dken2021> oh yea, sorta remember this, but it was ony basic tv
<Vordox> Sumica: inb4 Pokemon Theme
<Fluttercry> 05,15My god. This is worse than the Star Trek:Enterprise opening
<Sylandest> :D
<VenHur> This one is a sigh of relief from the last three, and the lyrics even better sounding!
<Kurra> this intro is better though :>
<Dken2021> this one's kinda fine
<MadSurge> Ohai Fluttercry!
<VenHur> ...In my opinions though.
<Lil_B> oh, this sounds ... not really badf actually, at least better :)
<Ponyloverforever> i wanna go back to the first theme
<Sumica> 00,10good op but shit show
<Meanwhile> ...I regret that they learned the meaning of creativity.
<Kurra> PFFF Star Trek Enterprise was the most chill opening |3
<Michael> hai Fluttercry
<Sumica> 00,10and then
<taoumi> i agree with Sumica
<Applejack2012> hi
<Michael> wat
<Chrysalis> this wasnt actually that bad
<Sylandest> oh god
<Bronysith> there was a g5?
<Sylandest> no
<Chrysalis> but the art style was wrong
<Lil_B> G5 was when I stopped watching :/
<AJIsAwesome> Never watched this one...:S
<Dken2021> ......when did this happen?
<Sumica> 00,10there is even a g6
<Kurra> Wow, they grew up and passed driving school eh?
<AJIsAwesome> G6?
<Meanwhile> Oh this was the one where the kid could digipunch shit isn't it.
<Chrysalis> also, police digimon
<Chrysalis> was wierd
<AJIsAwesome> Wait
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile yup
<Michael> seriously wth
<Kencolt> I have a liking for this one-- when thatr guy PUNCHES OUT A FREAKING GIANT DIGIMON to get HIS to evolve-- well!
<AJIsAwesome> Police Digimon?
<Lil_B> yeah, G6 started 1 or 2 years ago I think
<Sumica> 00,10well we ready for springer?
<Fluttercry> 05,15YEAAH

<Meanwhile> We were afraid you'd do this.
<Vordox> SO HOW ABOUT TAKING A PERSON WHO IS NOT CRAZY, Springer?
<Chrysalis> i can't believe im gonna say this
<Meanwhile> And then you did.
<DashWithRainbows> Sexy

<Kencolt> And he gets the freaks. Of course he gets the freaks.
<DashWithRainbows> They must be actors.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Mega_Milk> Im sorry. Is it bad that he kinda reminds me of a shaved saturn?
<DashWithRainbows> Normal bronies would not do this.
<Wirisme> not sure if trolls or actors
<Chrysalis> Kencolt theyre actors
<Meanwhile> She wears a dress.
<Vordox> OH LOOK, A PERSON WHO is PERFECT for the common brony

<Chrysalis> Fluttercry at least they got the characters right
<Meanwhile> Oh wow. That caused me physical pain.
<Sumica> 00,10I expect we will see more of this to come later
<Fluttercry> 05,15That wasn't nearly as much fun as I thought it'd be :(
<Sumica> 00,10it's gauker, to be expected

<Ponyloverforever> idk
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: Meh. 2.
<ekips> Okay, I didn't know JErry Springer before this, now I don't want to know anymore...
<VenHur> Rainbow Dash...with the horn of a unicorn?
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: I've seen worse.
<Michael> srsl, no words
<Fluttercry> 05,150/10 would not buy from again
<DashWithRainbows> It was a 2 at tops.
<MadSurge> HAHAHA this was like Italian tv
<Michael> *srsly
<Dken2021> and to think, his show started as a political talk show
<VenHur> Don't know if it 20% Cooler, or just plain wrong.
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Nice try Springer. Have som real spaghetti.
<Dken2021> hola GilDash
<Sylandest> howdy GilDash :)
<Invimon> hai GilDashy ^^
<DashWithRainbows> But since you could tell they were bad actors, -18546/10
<Michael> hai GilDash
<DashWithRainbows> Would want to throw in the garbage.
<MadSurge> Dken2021: much like many stupid italian shows state to be :D
<Invimon> that was ridicolous xD
<AJIsAwesome> I've seen worse spaghetti videos than this. This doesn't even faze me.
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash! :)
<Meanwhile> The funny thing is if actual people had been on there it probably would have made the fandom look worse.
<AJIsAwesome> ALso, hi GilDash :)
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> DashWithRainbows: You know that the mouth breathers in the audience bought it.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: spaghetti videos?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile lol true
<Ponyloverforever> hi GilDash
<Wirisme> How so?
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Agreed.
<Applejack2012> hi

<Sumica> 00,10now some good openings
<Vordox> Suddenly Riff
<Lil_B> YES! BUTTERFLY!
<MadSurge> Dat guitar riff
<VenHur> I hate fandoms like Sonic's, but the Bronies are suprisingly not annoying.
<Dken2021> well, nothing to get upset about really, even if they were actors or not, I see no reason to be mad about it
<Michael> this song is childhood!
<Fluttercry> 05,15VenHur....suuuuuure
<VenHur> And thus why I loved you guys.
*Chrysalis hugs VenHur
*AJIsAwesome hugs VenHur :)
<Vordox> Fluttercry: Are we "annoying" Fluttercry?
*Invimon cuddles VenHur :D
<Dken2021> VenHur hey, there's some good sonic fans out there
<Fluttercry> 05,15Not you guys
<Vordox> <.< This isn't the Digimon theme?
<ekips> again, the german versions of these songs are surprisingly well made
*VenHur hugs everypony
<Michael> yeah Vordox
*taoumi <.< goes to shower then make ponies
*Michael hugs VenHur
<Mega_Milk> Meanwhile: are you sure/ the shaved version of saturn in a pink tutu kinda killed it for me......
<Applejack2012> that 360p
<Fluttercry> 05,15Just the more...unsavory elements
<Meanwhile> Fluttercry: Or more honestly "Some of you guys..."
<DashWithRainbows> VenHur You obviously don't browse Tumblr enough.
<MadSurge> How can a pacman ghost become a cyber insect?!
<DashWithRainbows> Trust me.
<taoumi> btw cactusmon is best cactus
<AJIsAwesome> Fluttercry: I know what you're talking about
<Lil_B> there actually quite a lot annoying things about a lot of Bronys Behaviours, but not here on Broynystate, that's why I'm here :)
<Vordox> But the intro is the G1 or G2...
<DashWithRainbows> Tonnes of drama and attention whores.
<Vordox> This song is NEITHER
<AJIsAwesome> Some of the MLP Tumblrs are.........INTERESTING.
<Lil_B> I tracked doewn both Digimon Soundtrack CDs fot the Songs >.<
<Meanwhile> Mega_Milk: Non-actors would have been so much more awkward and faily.
<Applejack2012> cya
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: Princess Molestia is my favourite
<Fluttercry> 05,15There is a reason my Brony related activities are limited to Bronystate
<Invimon> Lil_B, that Piano cover was sooo awesome ^^
<Sumica> 00,10this op i did't like so much
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: I only saw one :D
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: Meh. Not a fan of Molestia, IMO.
<Vordox> Fluttercry: So if someone pushed you to a big meetup?
<Chrysalis> Fluttercry come to the next BUCK
<Lil_B> Invimon It truly is :;) I even have the german Digimon HGold Soundtrack Sealed XD
<Chrysalis> branch out to awesome
<Fluttercry> 05,15Vordox I went to Bronycon. It was fun.
<Vordox> I agree with what Chrysalis says
<Vordox> I WON'T GO THERE though
<Invimon> Sumica, can you look upt the seasn 1 piano cover? it's worth it ^^
<Sumica> 00,10I like ponys, not bronys
<Fluttercry> 05,15^
<Chrysalis> Vordox why
<Vordox> If Saturn sees me, I gotta sprint for my life
<VenHur> Sumica: WHAT? WHAT?! WHAAAT?!
<Fluttercry> 05,15Most of my joy comes from the show and chatting with you guys
<Chrysalis> Saturn isnt THAT bad
<Wirisme> pretty much
<Lil_B> ^^
<Chrysalis> hes supprising normal
<DashWithRainbows> Fluttercry I can understand that a lot.
<MadSurge> Sumica: but you like fans like us, don't you?
<Chrysalis> for a scottish guy
<Obsidian> Hey guys, what ar- um are we watching digimon?
<Vordox> It's not that Saturn is bad, he's just a very huggy person.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Obsidian :)
<Vordox> And I don't like hugs
<Vordox> :D
<Meanwhile> I like being able to spell ponies.
<Dken2021> Obsidian we were earlier, and hai there
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but i dont see you all acting as nutters either =p
*Lil_B not-huggs Vordox

<Sumica> 00,10liked this opening
*Vordox wonders what the feck that even means.
<Mozdoc> You know, I'll confess something. Before, I wasn't ever interested in this whole Digimon thing, but after seeing this I'll admit, there's some cool creatures there.
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: Nutters?
<MadSurge> Fluttercry: I like chatting too ^^ but meeting up with people at BUCK was fun :)
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: Mostly.
<Vordox> OH I remember this song!
<Dken2021> running to the left, as always
<Invimon> Mozdoc, it even has a Cuthulu Digimon :D
<Chrysalis> just whatever you do
<GilDash> MadSurge: It helps clear confusion too, eh? ;)
<Chrysalis> DONT go to the bronystate event at buck
<Fluttercry> 05,15MadSurge that's why I enjoyed Bronycon, I got to hang out with some Bronystate people
<Chrysalis> unless you like being embarrassed
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: It's basically the people who obsess over the show. I mean 100 percent obsess over it.
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Why? O.o
<Lil_B> Chrysalis why?
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: You mean people who want attention?
<Chrysalis> do you not recall me and gildash being put on a panel
<Chrysalis> with nothing to say
<MadSurge> GilDash: your gender for example ;)
<Lil_B> Biggest Dreamer :) a really good song too :)
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Why did you go up to the panel then? :P
<DashWithRainbows> Chrysalis You were put on a panel?
<GilDash> MadSurge: Exactly. XD
<Chrysalis> because Saturn said to
<DashWithRainbows> I NEED YOU TO TELL ME MORE
<DashWithRainbows> NAO
<Chrysalis> you do what mods say
<Dken2021> Chrysalis that happened?
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Why not just shake your head?
<GilDash> Yeah, that pannel was really fun. >_>
<Vordox> Chrysalis: TAKE A STAND FOR WHO YOU ARE
<Invimon> Lil_B, who was the bad guy in season 3 again?
<Chrysalis> well, all my friends somehow saw it
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: No, not like that. It's kind of like people who think that the show is real or people who are obsessed enough to change their names to the characters on the show.
<MadSurge> Fluttercry: you american?
<Chrysalis> so that was fun
<Fluttercry> 05,15Yup
<CCCP> hi-
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: I wouldn't mind a land of Brony only
<Michael> hai CCCP
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and with this one i stoped watching digimon
<Obsidian> Hello CCCP
<Sumica> 00,10F was odd cause they did't have digimon partners
<Lil_B> Chrysalis I would eather act like a statue, because I can't handle the situation, or act like a totall Jackass XD
<Chrysalis> DashWithRainbows yeah, me and gildash got put on the panel while Wrek drew prarity
<CCCP> hi Michael and Obsidian!
*Lil_B hugs CCCP
<Kencolt> Sumica: Yeah-- in Frontier thyey WERE the Digimon...
<GilDash> It was super fun. >_>
<Cypresswolf> Digimon series lost me here
<Dken2021> F was where they were avatars to digimon right?
<Vordox> Lil_B: I'm not caring if anyone sees me
<GilDash> Totally not awkward at all. <_<
<Chrysalis> DashWithRainbows http://i.imgur.com/sCaqn.jpg
*CCCP huggles Lil_B ^-^
<Invimon> Sumica, they had rabbit that was able to kill other digimon with farts in the game
<Dken2021> hai CCCP
<Vordox> If I would go up or not depends on the situation. :P But I would decide the outcome of either choice.
<CCCP> hello Dken2021!
<DashWithRainbows> Chrysalis Is dat you wit da pink hare?
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Why do you have that?! Get rid of it! XD
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: No, that's Saturn.
<Chrysalis> GilDash i have more :P
<DashWithRainbows> lies.
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: Meh. I don't think we would need one. True, we aren't like many other fandoms, but we seriously don't need an island for us.
<Lil_B> Vordox I kinda do :/ not much because I know it doesn't mean much, but still, I really hate talking in front of lots of people
<Tailsy> hello people of bronystate
<DashWithRainbows> He isn't holding an iron brew.
<Chrysalis> DashWithRainbows im the one with long hair
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Truth! I shared a room with him!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Tailsy :)
<DashWithRainbows> THAT ISN'T SATURN
<CCCP> hello DashWithRainbows!
<Dken2021> Chrysalis what did you talk about on that panel?
<Lil_B> hello people of Tailsy
<Sumica> 00,10shall we go back to the show now?
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Yes it is. ^_^
<VenHur> Sumica: Frontier was a different concept, instead of having Digimon partners, they have digivice to BECOME the digimons, which I find interesting...
<CCCP> hi AJIsAwesome and Tailsy
<DashWithRainbows> Howdy CCCP.
<AJIsAwesome> Sure.
<Invimon> hai Tailsy ^^
<Vordox> Lil_B: so do I. BUt if I would go up there, I would be akward but I wouldn't be weird. :P
<Chrysalis> also
<DashWithRainbows> GilDash Liieeeeessssss
<Michael> hai DashWithRainbows and Tailsy
<GilDash> DashWithRainbows: Nope. :p
<Vordox> Sumica: How about "no"? :P

<Kandarihu> The woman they're both fighting over isn't even cute. And she seems to have no personality at all. It's as if they value her for her bust size and nothing more.

<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> The irony would be undieing if some one where to whine about this being streamed, when Mister Crabs is playing the smallest violen.
<AJIsAwesome> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: :D
<Meanwhile> That's...not irony.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> How so?
<Vordox> Yesh Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH that's ain Irony

<DashWithRainbows> Ironing?
<Thrackerzod> ^
<Shizuka> 13like what
<VenHur> ...Oh...
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Seriously how is that not ironic.

<VenHur> Um...he-he...
<Sumica> 00,10spongebob dose still alive
<Vordox> Sumica: So MUCH grammatical errors here...
<Ponyloverforever> yay
<VenHur> With a special cameo from Jack Black...

<GilDash> Holy hell...
<Vordox> So much Paper died that day

<Kurra> OKAY THIS IS AWESOME
<weeping_pegasi82> I would die from boredom
<VenHur> Name of the video?
<fluttercry> 05,15Okay, how is Touhou so popular? It looks like just another bullet hell game
<Vordox> MadSurge: Based on Elly's theme from.. Touhou 3, I think
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: I don't know what Touhou actually is either. I've only ever seen remix music vids of it.
<Vordox> <--- You see here there with the Scytche soon at the end of the video
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oddly enough i like the enlgish version of this one
<Sumica> 00,10fluttercry, fandom
<Vordox> fluttercry: WHY!?
<Vordox> fluttercry: WHYYYYYYYYYYY!?
<Wrek> 05touhou?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Soooooo I still say it is irony considering the intent of it being streamed, to provide entertainment for us, yet one deciding to instead whine about it. I would say that is not an expected, or in this case an opposite reaction to it.
<Vordox> WELL I OUGHTA explain it all
<Kurra> this is SO BAWSS O_O
<Obsidian> Apperantly Vordox is a fan
<Vordox> 1 Man, 1 dream, 1 change.
<weeping_pegasi82> love this song
<Vordox> And then, fandom strikes
<Mozdoc> What is this video?
<Vordox> CENSORING IS BAD
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Its just also funny that whining would fall in line with the "smallest violen"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then kickbot strikes
<Vordox> You cannot STOP FREEDOM!
<Meanwhile> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: But that's something you'd expect to happen regardless. It's amusing, but not ironic.
<Meanwhile> Wombo Tri Combo.
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: mainly, a bullet hell game series. But people took all the boss characters and gave them comics and personalities
<VenHur> Apperantly, no one knows the video...
<fluttercry> 05,15lol dat kick bot

<Kurra> I wonder how many DDR songs came from atual bands then. o.o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> witch doctor, damn i feel old
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Also Meanwhile the type of irony I was refering to is dramatic irony which is typically used to convey that the person is oblivious to something, in this case whining and not noticing the worlds smallest violin analogy.
<Meanwhile> That's not dramatic irony either.
<Sumica> 00,10dramatic irony, that's like a fire station burning to the ground
<CountDoofus> I heard the band members were actually animators.
<Meanwhile> Dramatic irony is when the audience is aware of something the characters in the media in question aren't.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> How is it not? Okay. Fine. You are still wrong.
<Vordox> Anyway, Touhou is a game franchise created by ZUN's former group back in the 1990s, which had a mellow increase of fans due to the Music at most first and the rather strange game formula of the First Touhou, after that he decided to do more of the same game with some changes to a more friendlier Bullet Hell, and this lasted up to the 5th Touhou, from which the fandom has grown over several years, And then he decided to Go Solo fro

<Sonny> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: sleep tight ^^

<fluttercry> 05,15THERE IS NO STORY
<CountDoofus> ... I have NO clue about what I just saw.
<GilDash> fluttercry: Isn't that how fandoms work?
<Crystaline_Shard> It's a giant robot battling a giant tobot hand what is there to get.
<Vordox> fluttercry: There is, and actually simplier then people try to think it is =P
<Zuxxez123> Who a needs a story? I mean really...
<Sumica> 00,10whats to understand, a robot came out of his head to do battle with another robot that came out of his head.
<Kurra> yes there is, it's just told as if the Doctor were leading you through it.
<Vordox> Eeeyup Sumica
<DeadpoolDash> i love this gif http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mazrxx994e1r8uiq6o1_1280.gif

<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Poor scooter
<Sylandest> in that it doesnt need to make sense
<Vordox> The factions and else have been validated as well :P
<fluttercry> 05,15This is why I hate anime. Shit tried to be all deep and artistic, and it just comes off as dumb

<Vordox> Sumica: Black Cat, Needless for example? ^^ Or Shiki if you want more grossic style. Or go pure Immature joke of Panty and Stocking
<Crystaline_Shard> Sumi up there jammin to the tunez.
<Kinixys> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: I'm suprised someone crossed them. The two shows and characters couldn't be any different.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> That reminds me of my old car. I loved that thing, and it loved to break down.

<CK|Ded> But it's pretty darn similar.

<Shizuka> 13only kirk i know is from generations, which i suppose he was more mellowed out
*LunasGuard starts making pies and starts eating
<Zuxxez123> Shizuka: Though, people do take it to a new extent from time to time, his pauses aren't horridly long, but this guy is doing a good version.
<Kandarihu> It's an exagurration of his speaking style.
