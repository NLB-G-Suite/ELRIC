<Ponies> I like the song...
<Combustiblelemons> lol
<sotha> Is being vegetarian not that normal in their land? Otherwise why would she point it out?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I like this song, but it's the only one I don't know the words to since it never gets stuck in my head

<WF_Chronicles> Well like
<DubstepMaster> AND WHY WOULD U LIKE A DIRTY GUY ELKY?????
<Drake> 04It's fine for a character to be stoic and not care much, but they always need a driving force - Glacymr lacked that
<Glacymr> 12that's what i just said XD
<Don_East> Wingboners exist, an unofficial web-comic told me so!
<interior_gummy> they didnt share and care, so they fought a war
<BronyTj> this is the best part of the episode

<Applegenier> 0BUENO
<Glacymr> 12well
<DSNesmith> poor pinkie
<Tacowiz> Silverscreen Cinema Fact: Pinkie's actually dressing the way strippers in the 1800s dressed. This is the most obvious case of Crap Past the Radar on this show.
<GabeMoist> lol
<butidontwanna> at least spike has good taste in music
<HaveTubaWillTravel> To be fair, it's kind of supposed to be terrible. The two groups were united in their hatred of it.
<ThatGuyWithThePonyThread> lol
<DSNesmith> and her friends are just like 'yeah
<Keiw> lol
<Glacymr> 12that's why i said he needs to be around rinna and vinue
<Silver> No wonder they couldn't work out "we need to make a narrow path for the Buffalo to stampede through"
<trunsako> Absotively
<Darf14> So according to Pinkies Song we should go to WAR!

<Aponymous> When Travolta shows up, you will.
<prince-dari> Who chose this horrible film?
<DeadlyPony> Bleehbeaah boo

<Axel_Foaley> Maybe you should breathe more poison
<Ghosties> 4It's okay, LuridChronomancer; just one crossover a week is okay in my book. But if you have any ideas, please do them!
<thetrollside> no hipster

<Camz> fires of mount. doom
<Ghosties> 4That's much longer that I expected
<Darf14> Blue air kills us, if thats true then we would of died by now
<Pixel64> It's basically a "take that" from the cast and crew I think

<loz> That's some tasty ham.
<InsertCupcake> I suppose a dfferent oxidising agent could be present
<Pixel64> I understand now why the camera is always tilted. The cameraman hated the movie so much, he drank before every shoot so he could forget about it
<DSNesmith> they filmed this movie on the side of a mountain
<everfreenights> CAMERA
<DragonRage> 'cause he ain't got nobody to listen to

<Sol> 0Well, I've been trying to introduce it, but this stuff don't work without a raid
<Dashite> It's Rule Leverage
<DSNesmith> 9You accidentally say 'Anypony' in public
<Grey_Smoke> you know your a pony when you are a donutholic, and your best friend is pony joe.
<Ascendant> eXAKR I wasn't talking about your lines
<Dashite> I actually caught myself saying Anypony the other day...
<Ascendant> was just too lazy to remove them from the lines I was pasting over, which was drf's
<DSNesmith> 9I've started thinking it
<Ascendant> drf, it's running but apparently it screwed up
<DSNesmith> 9I go 'wonder what everypony's doing--oh fffuuuuu'
<Dashite> It just kinda slipped out. I don't think anyone noticed. No one said anything at least.
<DSNesmith> 9I keep waiting for good Brony merch
<Roman500> you know your a pony when you curse Celestiadammit
<Darf14> Looks like Ghosties posted on the leverage thread, I thought he said he was going to bed
<Grey_Smoke> You know your a pony when you ask for grass in your sandwhich without thinking.
<Roman500> I said that once
<DSNesmith> 9so I can proudly wear a Pinkie Pie tee in public
<NightSeas> 12What's up, Ascendant?
<DSNesmith> 9or decorate my dorm with pink posters
<DSNesmith> 9right now all the merch is like...
<Roman500> or spam FUG servers with Pinkie Pie?
<Roman500> on tf2?
<Nittany_Tiger1> I thought about putting a Twilight "Read" poster in the EMS library near my office.

<sotha> and there is also piano in the real one
<Darf14> 0Jazz Nyan...I like it
<sotha> I know. It is amazing. I want to play it on my tenor
<NotABrony> the thing that is most idyllic in the world of my little pony are the cutie marks
<Kyubey> 02Of SMG2?
<SilverSonic> atm yes .-.
<sotha> idyllic?
<Kyubey> 02You took to long xD
<SilverSonic> i died so many times
<prince-dari> U mad viewers?
<Kyubey> 02I died like... 7 times .-.
<SilverSonic> and i was mostly just goofing off
<Roman500> lol
<NotABrony> they represent a fulfillment of a dream that most people have but few ever fulfill
<Kyubey> 02Mostly on those mokey challanges
<Darf14> 0why would I be mad?
<Kyubey> 02monkey*
<sotha> oh okay
<NotABrony> finding a purpose
<SilverSonic> also speaking of Ninty stuffs, any requests for SSS XD
<sotha> jah

<Kyubey> 02Hmm...
<Dashite> What word?
<Darf14> 0what word?
<NotABrony> pony
<Kyubey> 02maybe something from SMG's OST

<Kyubey> 02Something from Super Mario 64
<NotABrony> prince-dari has unbanned ~T:block:*pony*!*@*
<sotha> And it is the cutie marks that are likely a major reason that their society is so . . . perfect.
<NotABrony> cant you read?
<Kyubey> 02Nostalgia'd
<Dashite> No. I can't.
<SilverSonic> kk
<NotABrony> cool
<Darf14> 0I wonder if I can find a loophole for it, block that word and Ill see what I can do
<Dashite> At least, not that blue text.
<NotABrony> cutie marks are the thing I would most like to exist in the real world
<Dashite> And Sprinkles damn purple text.
<SilverSonic> SSS this week is a trial show week XD
<Roman500> lolwat?
<Kyubey> 02the ONLY good thing that I won't forget easily of SMG2 is that stage remake of King Thomp (or however is spelled)
<SilverSonic> mostly cause im gonna try out new broadcasting software
<Kyubey> 02Niiceee~
<NotABrony> by adolescence, all people would find the thing that makes them special, and content

<Kyubey> 02YES
<Kyubey> 02<333
<Dashite> Original Leverage thread has been marked for deletion.
<Kyubey> 02N64 all the waaaay
<NotABrony> make him say "fuck the police"
<Roman500> look its chief
<DSNesmith> 9so the brief and meteoric rise of Leverage comes to a fiery end
<drf|laptop> 03nah

<NotABrony> awesome
<SilverSonic> Hmm...okies ill throw throwback galaxy in as well ;p

<Bjornfot> 14NOW
<drf|laptop> 03Bob-Omb Battlefield is so much better
<Bjornfot> 14FOR LEVERAGE
<SilverSonic> thats true ;p
<Darf14> 0Maybe you should do a different tactic with the leverage thread, try using the Cyclon picture so people might get it
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<NotABrony> i dont get it
<drf|laptop> 03sigh
<SilverSonic> OK, I'll have 3 versions of the same song in the show how bout that! *shot*
<Bjornfot> 14http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36196421.html
<drf|laptop> 03my fingertip is bleeding
<sotha> to just imagine how different this world would be if, well not only so explicitly being shown what makes each of us special were so, but even if there was just such an emphasis on that process.
<drf|laptop> 03makes typing painful
<Roman500> ah better
<Light_Latias> 12Cool Coom Mountain ~w~
<Roman500> thanks
<Light_Latias> 12*Cool
<SilverSonic> XD
<NotABrony> how the fuck do i reply?
<SilverSonic> K
<prince-dari> Aren't you going to get a perm ban if you keep ban evading?
<SilverSonic> So 2 songs from SM64, one remix by me, and one from SMG2
<SilverSonic> Alrighty!
<sotha> Speaking of which, how would any pony even play a woodwind?
*SilverSonic is counting them as requests anyways
<Bjornfot> 14prince-dari: i have hundreds of proxies.
<Nittany_Tiger1> I did in middle school.
<Nittany_Tiger1> Also, goodnight.
<NotABrony> special mouthpieces(reeds?).
<prince-dari> Still, being banned on sight isn't exactly fun.
<Darf14> 0I never use proxies
<prince-dari> And cya Nittany_Tiger1.
<Roman500> and dragon you mean
<SilverSonic> hmm...lol fine, ill throw in Cave Dungeon (Full Version) in as well XD
<Roman500> not pony
<Nittany_Tiger1> Played clarinet, so yes.
<Bjornfot> 14oh yes it is, prince-dari
<Darf14> 0I can use them but I decide not to use it at all
<NotABrony> good point sotha
<Bjornfot> 14and they'll get tired of it eventually
<Roman500> I guess
<sotha> Sotha plays clarinet, bassoon, and saxophone. She would be very sad as a pony.
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Nittany_Tiger1> See ya prince-dari
<NotABrony> im trying to play the guitar, been going at it for 2 years
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Nittany_Tiger1> The reeds of Saxs and Clarinets are similar IIRC.
<Nittany_Tiger1> But Saxs have larger ones.
<Dashite> Instruments... I hated music class so much. >_<
<Nittany_Tiger1> Anyway, I'm gone.
<sotha> They can be used interchangeably in most cases
<NotABrony> i hated music class too
<NotABrony> i would have failed if it were possible
<Roman500> I had an idea on how ponies could ply instruments like guitars without being supported
<Darf14> 0This is the only thing that will drive me insane
<Roman500> *play
<sotha> Alto sax / alto clarinet, tenor sax / bass clarinet, soprano sax / soprano clarinet
<prince-dari> Trololo.
<NotABrony> unicorns can do anything
<Dashite> Until Intermediate Microeconomics, Music was the only class that I ever failed...
<drf|laptop> 03LOL iTunes y u no be honest
<NotABrony> also, ponies would have thier own insutments
<Roman500> yeah...
<drf|laptop> 03"iTunes LP is for computers running iTunes 9 or later only"
<NotABrony> fuck spelling
<drf|laptop> 03orly?
<drf|laptop> 03I use Winamp 2.91
<drf|laptop> 03they're just mp4 audio >_>
<sotha> I bet ponies could play the theramin well.
<Bjornfot> eeyup
<SilverSonic> lmfao you're using an old winamp? XD
<Roman500> anypony ever see a contrabasssax?
<NotABrony> imagine the insurments, pretty much durms would be the only insturment that would be pretty much the same
<drf|laptop> 03yes.
<drf|laptop> 03the new ones suck
<SilverSonic> xD
<sotha> I've only seen up to a Bb bass sax in real life
<drf|laptop> 03also I have a reason for using 2.9x
<SilverSonic> ;o
<drf|laptop> 03if you look up adplug
<Roman500> they are really big
<LL> 12connection bork
<drf|laptop> 03it's a plugin that lets you play .imf audio files
<drf|laptop> 03which is what old DOS games use
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03and yay old video game music?
<sotha> I could imagine. But I think I'll stick to the bassoon (so much fun to play)
<DSNesmith> 9aight I'm sleepin now
<DSNesmith> 9g'night bornies
<DSNesmith> 9wow
<DSNesmith> 9typing fail

<Roman500> I play the drums
<Bjornfot> and now that htread is gone too.
<NotABrony> why human bodies and pony heads?
<sotha> I do not like that picture
<NotABrony> drums are cool

<NotABrony> i dont know many drummers
<drf|laptop> 03and fail @ radio stations
<Roman500> very fun
<sotha> So much coordination between your limbs.
<drf|laptop> 03they made it sound like this song was new as of a couple weeks ago
<drf|laptop> 03but the music video's been auround since Feburary... :/
<NotABrony> but my school has 5.9 million guitar players
<NotABrony> so any drummer can be in any band he wants
<NotABrony> as long as its only with guitarists
<NotABrony> our guitar program is awesome

<prince-dari> No they don't.
<drf|laptop> 03and the song itself has been around since before Febuary 2010 o.o
<Dashite> Depends on how the ads are set up.
<Roman500> #6 was funny
<Bjornfot> depends.
<Bjornfot> but usually
<Roman500> ooooo green
<SilverSonic> its because of popularity of the song probably
<prince-dari> Well a lot of sites have per page view adds.
<Bjornfot> Since it's 100% Blogger, I assume it's all Google Ads.
<Bjornfot> And that's click-only.
<drf|laptop> 03well yeah
<drf|laptop> 03it's just odd when radio stations have that much lag
<NotABrony> why does EqD allow shit fanfics on their site?
<SilverSonic> yeah
<drf|laptop> 03I love listening tot he radio to hear about 'new' songs such as this one but seriously wtf
<NotABrony> i mean, have they even heard of editors?
<drf|laptop> 03it's on the same album that Secrets was on
<SilverSonic> and i dont even listen to public radio anymore
<drf|laptop> 03which was on the radio like last year
<SilverSonic> most of whats on there is god awful
<drf|laptop> 03I do
<Roman500> they do
<drf|laptop> 03but I like top 40 so eh
<Dashite> You don't want to see the stuff they don't allow.
<Roman500> they have tons
<Roman500> TONS
<NotABrony> so many errors
<SilverSonic> i swear i tell my sister more than once to turn her crap down
<NotABrony> i cant read it
<NotABrony> it hurts my head
<Roman500> I have an idea stream the Luna Game
<SilverSonic> and she has that radio blasting just to annoy me .-.
<Bjornfot> oh well, i should probably go to bed now
<drf|laptop> 03hmm
<prince-dari> Ok, cya Bjornfot.
<drf|laptop> 03doing something just to annoy someone else
<drf|laptop> 03you wouldn't do that, now, would you?
<Roman500> bye bye
*drf|laptop hides
<SilverSonic> i;p
<SilverSonic> ;p*
<sotha> So far as I understand, they do not have editors so much as a team of pre-readers who make suggestions to the authors or something.
<Bjornfot> i'll only get 11 hours of sleep if i want to catch today's stream ;_;
<drf|laptop> 03give your sister a high 5 for me
<SilverSonic> Nou
<Bjornfot> Bye all. May the Leverage be with you!
<junh1024-XD> I use 5 because it has format converter & auto-tag
<Dashite> ONLY 11 hours he says.
<sotha> What is happening in the stream right now anyway?
<drf|laptop> 03eh
<Darf14> 0I am getting tired at my end as well, cya guys tomorrow, bye ;)
<prince-dari> Nothing, waiting for suggestions.
<drf|laptop> 03auto tagging sucks
<Pixel64> Nothing, the stream is offline
<SilverSonic> tbh, she hates me entirely
<drf|laptop> 03iTunes does auto tagging and I've seen lots of typos in there
<prince-dari> Stream's online btyw.
<drf|laptop> 03especially for Pokémon music
<prince-dari> btw*
<NotABrony> uhhh
<sotha> I've made several suggestions.
<Dashite> The stream is online, he's just browsing EqD.
<drf|laptop> 03I put my 2BA Master CD in my computer, iTunes thinks it's the spanish verson >_>
<Pixel64> Oh, whoops.

<Roman500> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_kIVI9y_OY

*drf|laptop hides
<drf|laptop> 03yes bad metaphor I know

<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<drf|laptop> 03Rolling in th eDeep, or as I call it, Trolling in the Deep
<drf|laptop> 03because it's on the radio ALL THE TIME
<drf|laptop> 03It's nothing like ANY other music on top 40 radio, WHY are htey playing it so much? :@
<SilverSonic> who sings it? XD
<sotha> I haven't seen any yet, so don't ask which
<drf|laptop> 03ADELE
<drf|laptop> 03or someone

*junh1024-XD np: Nyan Cat - Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya! MP3@185kps
<drf|laptop> 03it's just like that Black Horse and the Cherry Tree song
<drf|laptop> 03I just hate those
<Roman500> luna game reaction video?
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, guitar is cool but guitar + annoying female singing voice + nothing else just pisses me off
<prince-dari> Fine, after this.
<Roman500> good
<drf|laptop> 03now piano, that makes anything good
<SilverSonic> Junh: i has a megadrive ver. of that

<Roman500> nvm then
<drf|laptop> 03Promo Only is awesome, I used to collect their stuff
<NotABrony> http://www.m0ar.org/3477
<drf|laptop> 03now I just get their occasional release
<drf|laptop> 03pirated of course since I can't legally get them
<drf|laptop> 03YOU might be able to :P
<drf|laptop> 03basically they only sell to DJs
<SilverSonic> lol
<SilverSonic> XD
<drf|laptop> 03and when I say sell I mean SELL, the CDs cost like $40 EA>CH
<drf|laptop> 03which for 20 songs is NOT worth it
<SilverSonic> I'm that THAT professional of a DJ you know
<SilverSonic> XD
<drf|laptop> 03so I just pirate them
<drf|laptop> 03you don't need to be professional
<sotha> What is this video about?
<drf|laptop> 03you just have to be able to prove that you're a DJ
<drf|laptop> 03otherwise I'd sign up and just lie
<prince-dari> Reaction video to the Luna game.
<Roman500> reaction to the luna game
<Roman500> damn you
<drf|laptop> 03luckily a lot of people sell Promo Only stuff on ebay for much lower than retail price so I've snagged up loads from that
<drf|laptop> 03the nice thing about PO is that lots of times they have songs beore they're officially released.
<SilverSonic> wut i really want that is professional is some good jingles and Station IDs
<drf|laptop> 03that, and their Mainstream Radio series generally has the clean "radio edit" versions which can be hard to find for lots of songs :P
*SilverSonic might go to RPC Audio for that
<SilverSonic> ;p
<NotABrony> this is boring
<NotABrony> what is it
<drf|laptop> 03you could always do what Meijer did

<drfsupercenter> 03I already have them in mp3 form
<Drake> 04Oh really?
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm trying to find the actual disc
<drfsupercenter> 03for some reason, Amazon is sold out
<drfsupercenter> 03like completely sold out
<Drake> 04For a second I thought you were gonna bash it LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'll look elsewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<Drake> 04H-uh
<drfsupercenter> 03I love Transfurmers
<drfsupercenter> 03why would I bash it
<Drake> 04I've never known a movie score to be sold out
<Drake> 04Because you bash alot of things XD
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XKR6NC/ref=dm_dp_cdp?ie=UTF8&s=music

<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know why either
<drfsupercenter> 03and I also don't know why it says import o_O
<Drake> 04I also love how all the Transformers movies got horrible ratings but were smash hits at the box office
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Drake> 04It's almost amusing
<fluttershyfan> im back and the internet has went back to normal
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.filesonic.com/file/1444806774
<drfsupercenter> 03enjoy

<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I have premium but :P
<Drake> 04And thanks
<Drake> 04Yeah, I don't really mind waiting another 30 seconds.
<drfsupercenter> 03np
<Drake> 04I'm used to it with the YT mp3 converter
<drfsupercenter> 03WHY THE F*** ARE THERE NO TRANSFORMERS 1 OR 3 SCORES ANYWHERE?!?!?!?!?!
<drfsupercenter> 03and LOL converting, fail
<fluttershyfan> is is a cool song http://www.myspace.com/video/566764070/my-little-eurodancer-pony/107761737
<Drake> 04Well it's the only way (I can be bothered) to get some of the tracks I want
<junh1024-XD> dfr, what if i saaw TRANSFORMERS_DARK_SIDE_OF_MOON without seeing the previous 2 ?
<drfsupercenter> 03it would be fine
<Drake> 04Because most of the time I only want a single track from the album/score.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I would suggest seeing the other two
<drfsupercenter> 03why
<junh1024-XD> the other two didn't intrest me
<fluttershyfan> for some reason she closed her youtube account and put vids on myspace
<drfsupercenter> 03eh, I'm a quality wh*re so Ir efuse to download crappy quality uploads then convert them to even worse quality.
<drfsupercenter> 03the first one is definitely worth seeing
<Drake> 04Like with God of War - I don't want all of the cinematic/non-battle music.
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought the second was good but a lot of people here didn't like it for some reason
<junh1024-XD> i saw the M3 trailer and i was like...
<Drake> 04Fair enough drf
<Drake> 04LLOTS is the same
<junh1024-XD> cool, moon landing alternate history
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, that was awesome XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03NO SPOILERS
<Drake> 04drf, I liked the second - more story than the first.
<drfsupercenter> 03same here
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked all 3
<drfsupercenter> 03they were all equally good
<drfsupercenter> 03but some people like Articuo hated it
<drfsupercenter> 03+n
<Drake> 043 had a bit too much action (not that I'm complaining) and some nice plot twists
<fluttershyfan> this video on the stream is giving me a headache
<junh1024-XD> inb3: mmichael bay's scene cuttting
<drfsupercenter> 03oh yeah @ plot twists
<drfsupercenter> 03I was actually surprised at some parts
<fluttershyfan> lol.
<Drake> 04For the whole 2 1/2 hours about 2 were spent on fighting scenes XD
<Drake> 04Ditto
<Drake> 04<SPOILER> YOU DID NOT JUST DO THAT YOU SONNUVAGUN
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<junh1024-XD> I'm trying to find the actual CD of Transformers 3 score < the city cinema sells them at e tickets desk
<Noir> O.......K.......
<junh1024-XD> *the
<drfsupercenter> 03you can always type spoilers 3,3 like this
<Noir> Dang
<Drake> 04Which cinema? Because no cinema in Aus does that
<drfsupercenter> 03wait, what? They sell actual CDs?
<junh1024-XD> owait, that's the OST, not score
<junh1024-XD> right?
<drfsupercenter> 03probably.
<drfsupercenter> 03the OST is just a bunch of random crappy songs :/
<Drake> 04Aus cinemas are crap and way too expensive.
<drfsupercenter> 03some review on Amazon said they weren't going to release the physical CD until the Blu-Ray comes out o_O
<fluttershyfan> wut?
<Drake> 04$13 bucks for a single ticket. I can get cheaper at Dumaresq street. $5 per person.
<drfsupercenter> 03but for some reason
<drfsupercenter> 03the original Transformers score has vanished too
<drfsupercenter> 03all I can find are used copies from $120 and up
<drfsupercenter> 03which is stupid
<Drake> 04o_O
<Drake> 04lets go to the pirate bay... dot org
<drfsupercenter> 03again I have them all already but I want them physically
<drfsupercenter> 03again I have them all already but I want them physically
*Drake runs
<drfsupercenter> 03woah
<Drake> 04dat dang arrow key
<drfsupercenter> 03I just realized I have something that doesn't have flac rips on what.cde
<drfsupercenter> 03-e
<drfsupercenter> 03as an actual cd
<drfsupercenter> 03I shouldupload it
<drfsupercenter> 03+space
<Drake> 04I understood nothing of what you just said.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://what.cd/torrents.php?id=38228&torrentid=436026 <- the expanded score.;
<drfsupercenter> 03I was mainly talking to junh1024-XD
<junh1024-XD> it's a private torrent tracker
<Drake> 04And lol, this is expected of me.
<junh1024-XD> go ahead
<Drake> 04I look at the download just as it hits 34%
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm not doing so right now
<drfsupercenter> 03but I own that expanded score
<drfsupercenter> 03thing looks like a bootleg XD
<drfsupercenter> 03>pixelated album cover
<drfsupercenter> 03and I mean, it's like that. Mine's an official factory pressed CD. but an import from somewhere that obviously doesn't care about quality.
<Noir> I think that who ever made that video, was on some hard stuff.
<Drake> 04i.e. somewhere in C-
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Drake> 04No I won't make that joke
<Drake> 04A bit cruel
<drfsupercenter> 03I see FLAC rips of Transformers 3 score
<junh1024-XD> here's another word: FLACcebo
<drfsupercenter> 03How is that possible?
<drfsupercenter> 03if there's not actually a CD?
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 someone robbed a warehouse
<Drake> 04XD
<junh1024-XD> inb3: my 720p rips off HDmania of not-released BDmovies
<drfsupercenter> 03but those would be TV recordings.
<drfsupercenter> 03or something like I did with Apple TV
<junh1024-XD> no, some are BDrips
<drfsupercenter> 03supposedly.
<junh1024-XD> a few weeks early
<drfsupercenter> 03I can call anything a BD rip
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03well yea
<drfsupercenter> 03a few *weeks*
<drfsupercenter> 03not *months&
<drfsupercenter> 03**
<junh1024-XD> like, people working in the factory, borrow a disc for a few hours, copy, return
<Drake> 04Download speed: 78kb/s
<Drake> 04kill me
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Drake> 04It's usually around 200kb/s
<Drake> 04And I don't have anything else downloading
<drfsupercenter> 03that's probably because free filesonic limits your download speed.
<Drake> 04...It does it on purpose?
<Drake> 04BASTARDS
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes it does
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the 'joy' of file sharing websites
<drfsupercenter> 03but at least I found it :P
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway it's 5am
<drfsupercenter> 02[The current time where I live is 0305:02:2802 on 03Saturday, 07/16/201102. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
<drfsupercenter> 03I should probably get to bed.
<Drake> 04It's basically pay or gtfo
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah.
<Drake> 04Or they torment you until you pay
<Drake> 04either way
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what the world turns to, money.
<Drake> 04Anyway g'night drf
<drfsupercenter> 03bye
<MrPoniator> So what's on the schedule when the next stream starts?
<RainBroDash> The next stream is a re-stream of the last content, at a more eu-friendly time for anyone who can't make the first stream or anyone who wants to watch it again :P

<rubenflonne> *checks to see if anyone is here*
<MrPoniator> yo
<rubenflonne> greetings
<MrPoniator> 'sup?
<rubenflonne> nothing at all you
<MrPoniator> Just coding a game I've been working on
<rubenflonne> ah cool
<MrPoniator> Probably gonna go and play Demon's Souls though
<rubenflonne> did dari just leave it on some YTP playlist
<rubenflonne> and also once i got plat on demon souls, as much fun as i had with it, i can't sit through it again
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I guess he did
<MrPoniator> And well, I'm at 2-1 myself, because I got the game recently
<rubenflonne> as i said pretty fun game, bu you will see, once you do some stuff for everything it becomes tedious and really taken advantage of
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I know
<MrPoniator> But well, games can't really go forever, sadly
<rubenflonne> also it was funny when people try to troll your world and you use armor/weapon rapping armor just to destroy their stuff xD
<rubenflonne> agreed
<MrPoniator> Well, I haven't let anyone to enter my game yet, since I followed my buddy's advice to wear that ring that gives you 25% more health in the "dead" form and killed myself in nexus after beating the first boss
<MrPoniator> It kinda creeps me out how there are ton of bloodstains in Nexus, heh
<rubenflonne> xD people became pansies if they need to killed in the nexus xD
<rubenflonne> also my friend became so unsure of a boss so much he kept helping others untill he figured out how to beat him for real
<MrPoniator> Haha
<MrPoniator> Not a bad idea, for sure
<rubenflonne> it was the boss who drained stats
<MrPoniator> What stage is that?
<rubenflonne> forgetting his name
<rubenflonne> much later then where your at
<MrPoniator> Yeah, figured
<MrPoniator> Unless it was 1-2 or so
<rubenflonne> but the guy kept sapping your highest stat points
<MrPoniator> That sounds kinda weird
<MrPoniator> Is it a permanent change, or?
<rubenflonne> he kept sitting back next to the entrance of the boss because he found of it so he can figure out a way to do dodge the attack, it comes out so fast
<rubenflonne> and yes permanent change
<MrPoniator> Ouch
<rubenflonne> just not to people who come into th world
<rubenflonne> the**
<rubenflonne> hold on let me get the name of it
<MrPoniator> Ok
<rubenflonne> im glad my volume is low right now OWA is such a over played song
<rubenflonne> or this streams volume**
<MrPoniator> Well, I've muted the stream myself
<rubenflonne> well i can't seem to find any information on the person who does the attack
<rubenflonne> but its one of the bosses you will see
<rubenflonne> he is a pain
<MrPoniator> Oh well, I'll probably find out sooner or later
<rubenflonne> also last boss all you need is the weakest bow and you can win
<MrPoniator> And well, at least I've some patience with tedious/annoying bosses, thanks to Monster Hunter
<rubenflonne> nice
<rubenflonne> love monster hunter as well
<MrPoniator> I haven't played in a while myself
<MrPoniator> It's something like +250 hours in MHFU, +220 hours in MHTri and something like +50 in MHF1. Dropped MHF1 right after I started to get good at it, since MHFU launched around that time in Europe
<Ascendant> Drake

<MrPoniator> If he's around, maybe?
<Pyrate> He isn't?
<MrPoniator> I dunno
<rubenflonne> normally no, half the time we are not alowed to do this, not sure how sprinkles and the rest of the mods will react
<MrPoniator> Well, yeah
<Pyrate> I'll just work on my song in the meanwhile.
<MrPoniator> guess I'll get back to coding now
<Pyrate> See if I can't make a good solo :I

<MrPoniator> :3
<Pyrate> Ah, I'll still be in the chat.
<rubenflonne> well insomnia says fuck you so
<eXAKR> Wait frak
<rubenflonne> i can't go to sleep any time soon
<MrPoniator> Where are ya from, then?
<rubenflonne> south california
<rubenflonne> so 4 am
<MrPoniator> Ah. Finland here, so it's 2:12PM
<Pyrate> Norway here
<eXAKR> How did looking up on Flutterguy's voice actor lead me to all this? Oo;
<eXAKR> Oh wait.
<eXAKR> Robocop
*eXAKR smacks Blu Mankuma with Fluttershy
<rubenflonne> greetings fellow euro furs
<rubenflonne> i mean bronies
<MrPoniator> Lol
<rubenflonne> *shakes sleep from my head*
<rubenflonne> you know what sucks, they made SCII region locked x.x
<MrPoniator> StarCraft?
<rubenflonne> yup
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I heard about it from a buddy of mne who plays it
<MrPoniator> Any region locking is annoying as hell
<MrPoniator> So screw you Nintendo for region locking 3DS
<Pyrate> Freaking locks.
<MrPoniator> At least I've modded PS2 so that I can import games for it, but still
<Pyrate> Maybe I should just play a game.
<MrPoniator> I would've missed games like "9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors" if it wasn't for the region free
<MrPoniator> Though, DS is easy in the aspect that you can just get a flash card for it, but still
<rubenflonne> i hope soon we make more region free games, like we have now, or have blizzard understand this
<rubenflonne> but really the 3DS is region locked
<MrPoniator> It is, it is
<MrPoniator> And it's annoying because handhelds thus far have always been region free
<MrPoniator> At least on Nintendo's and Sony's part
<MrPoniator> And PSVita is going to be region free, so yay for that

<Pattyrick> that's what my dad and I are looking to get on ebay
<Pattyrick> we just want one for cheap so we can mess around with it
<Pattyrick> I bet it's going to be somewhat like the iPhone 3GS in terms of the amount of upgrades
<Pattyrick> a few minor internal tweaks to make it better
<Pattyrick> like the A5 processor
<eXAKR> Damn the MLP:FiM Videos on my iPhone took up too much space
<eXAKR> Need to delete some of them off :(

*Skylands noticed that
<Skylands> 10On your Espeon pic
<Espeon> 06that's just oddly cute o.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13The new Barclays advert is finally on Youtube |D
<Espeon> 06o3o
<Angel_Espeon> 13The only reason I like the adverts is because Stephen Merchant narrates them
<Angel_Espeon> 13and it makes me think of Wheatley
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL

<Skylands> 10o.o
<Espeon> 06what if she doesn't want to fly?
<lighty> Then we launch her
<Espeon> 06Umbreons are not aerodynamic enough
<lighty> I was launched
<lighty> ONCE
<Skylands> 10Today :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Yesterday~
<lighty> Yep :3.....
<lighty> Forget the once part
<Espeon> 06.-.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Somehow I STILL picture Skylands as a shiny Eevee
<Angel_Espeon> 13except now she has aviator goggles
<Angel_Espeon> 13my mind makes no sense .w.
<lighty> Oh, inwanted to ask that sky
<lighty> Donyou have a picture of your character?
<Skylands> 10[10:47] <Angel_Espeon> except now she has aviator goggles <- wat
<Skylands> 10Yus, lighty
<Skylands> 10Oh
<Espeon> 06o.O
<Espeon> 06Shiny Eevees.
<Skylands> 10I feel like someone else said they pictured me as an Eevee girl or something o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> I thought you were a latios :p
<Espeon> 06The plot thicken
<Espeon> 06s
<Skylands> 10shiny Breons
<HyperMetalLugia> Shiny Birds
<Skylands> 10Zorua
<Skylands> 10etc
<Skylands> 10This is why I do not make OCs, too many Pokémon that I like
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Pokémons are cool
<Espeon> 06Zoruas are certainly fine too.
<lighty> Floof is always good
<Skylands> 10The more the merrier
<HyperMetalLugia> Floof is deathly
<lighty> Depens
<HyperMetalLugia> Suffocate on floof
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Espeon> 06Zorua is certainly the dark type equivalent to an eevee.
<Espeon> 06Which is fun
<lighty> Just as umbres

<prince-dari> Yeah, my sound's really quiet though.
<Skylands> 10Ah
<prince-dari> Even though it's full volume on my computer.
<MrPoniator> It's white BG for me, since I'm using my client program
<prince-dari> Yeah, you get used to the yellow on white Poniator. :P

<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<NewDCD> 9how is it?
*Glacymr tickles HyperMetalLugia
<prince-dari> I see video, hear no audio.
<MrPoniator> Perhaps I should just switch the bg color for this channel
*HyperMetalLugia falls over and lols
<Hipster_Brony> 8i hear quiet static, no game audio
<MrPoniator> There we go
<MrPoniator> What's this?

<NewDCD> 9sorta, it IS a VN but really more like a movie
<Hipster_Brony> 8it has begun
<MrPoniator> Alright
<MrPoniator> I like VNs myself, especially "9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors"
<prince-dari> This thread. It needs more leverage.
<NewDCD> 9Oh, that's a great one
<prince-dari> Unfortunately that means having to make leverage.
<NewDCD> 9also, I have a problem with Stereo Mix
<NewDCD> 9gimme a sec
<NewDCD> 9it needs more leverage
*prince-dari makes leverage.
<MrPoniator> Let's just get some beverages
<Espeon> 06:3
<Hipster_Brony> 8i need to screencap this movie and make more image macros
<NewDCD> 9I think I know what the problem is now
<NewDCD> 9gonna see if I can make another solution
<prince-dari> INB4 we all get banned.
<Hipster_Brony> 8XD
*Vinyer puts Espeon on her back D:
<NewDCD> 9there
<NewDCD> 9press play
<NewDCD> 9apparently for some reason my Stereo Mix does not detect audio through USB audio device
<NewDCD> 9so I have to use my Speakers
<NewDCD> 9gotta find a solution for that
<NewDCD> 9I was quite digging using headphones
<NewDCD> 9testing audio
<Skylands> 10Woop

<Hipster_Brony> 8i hear it
*Vinyer brees all over you
<NewDCD> 9setting this thing on autoplay
*Skylands breefloofs
<NewDCD> 9I want you guys to give me your opinion on this
*HyperMetalLugia floofs feathers
<MrPoniator> So how is it more like a movie?
<Vinyer> 12heh
<NewDCD> 9and whether we should stream it sometime
<NewDCD> 9yeah, a movie you read xD
<Skylands> 10Ohai Obsi
<MrPoniator> True, true
<MrPoniator> But isn't that VNs mostly are?
<MrPoniator> what*
<MrPoniator> So what game was this?
<NewDCD> 9yeah,but most other VN's have interactivity
<NewDCD> 9Narcissu
<NewDCD> 9it's freeware
<MrPoniator> COolio
<MrPoniator> And well, interactivity varies between games, yeah
<prince-dari> How long is it?
<NewDCD> 9this is pretty much a Butterfly Circus, but with more despair
<MrPoniator> Policenauts and 999 are the best ones I've played so far
<Espeon> 06Hihi
<NewDCD> 9not much, I think one can finish it in the time of a regular movie
<prince-dari> Oh, cool.
<NewDCD> 9if you liked Policenauts, I hope you've played Snatcher
<MrPoniator> Maybe I'll give this a shot sometime
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I played Snatcher after finishing Policenauts
<NewDCD> 9Snatcher we'll stream here eventually
<MrPoniator> Ah, cool
<MrPoniator> And heh, I even boutgh Policenauts import after finishing the game
<MrPoniator> Too bad that two stickers and the spine card were missing, otherwise it'd be complete
<MrPoniator> Suddennly, louder music
<NewDCD> 9fixed my audio cable a bit
<MrPoniator> ok
<MrPoniator> But yeah, I guess I could give this game a shot sometime
<MrPoniator> Gonna go and finish my coding for today now
<Vinyer> 1,14o8°4o
<Vinyer> 12hi
<rubenflonne> good morning every pony
<NewDCD> 9why hello there
<rubenflonne> i see prince is not streaming anymore x3
<rubenflonne> or not sure if he is *shrugs*
<prince-dari> Its' DCD
<prince-dari> It's*
<rubenflonne> not colored dari?
<NewDCD> 9you feel relieved there's no pigs in the stream?
<prince-dari> It was Bjornfot's suggestion.
<Espeon> 06Breeface
<Espeon> 06and :33
<Hipster_Brony> 8i should have known
<prince-dari> Haha. XD
<prince-dari> He must be in league with Tacowiz.
*Hipster_Brony 8makes a note to check their IP's today
<rubenflonne> he made dari make me have a lobotomy this morning he made him play spiders web
<prince-dari> Heheheh.
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, dari, did you stay up all night?
<rubenflonne> semi
<prince-dari> Nah, I fell asleep when I put the stream on some playlist at about...
<rubenflonne> he just left on some YTP and left or something
<prince-dari> 9 am.
<Hipster_Brony> 8damn man
<rubenflonne> *shoots dari hard with a hand cannon* don't listen to bj again
<prince-dari> Next time I should stream the whole thing. :P
<rubenflonne> awwww
<rubenflonne> why did you go and do that
<prince-dari> :P
<rubenflonne> so far i can tell he broke a decent amount of rules *shrugs*
<rubenflonne> but i guess it depends on all your looks on it
<Hipster_Brony> 8accidental quads on /chat/, like a boss
<rubenflonne> i thought it was a system between you all to agree to allow a stream to be unscheduled and play it
<rubenflonne> like no one does anything until everypony hears about it on staff
<dance1211> hello there!
<dance1211> 3rd movienight in row
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was asleep before dari even started streaming it, so i couldnt have known XD
<prince-dari> I was the only mod left at the time.
<prince-dari> Even Sprinkles had left. XD
<rubenflonne> i know x3
<rubenflonne> thats why i brought up that point
<rubenflonne> because our group for D&D (still going with it hipster if you wish to join any time) with sprinkles in, wanted to watch a movie/pony marathon, but he said no because you guys had to discuss it between eachother
<rubenflonne> so thats what confused me
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, major stuff like that we do
<Hipster_Brony> 8but that was technically part of post-show

<NewDCD> 9anyways, this is the sort of thing you should watch from the start

<MrPoniator> We need gay counterpart of pedobear
<Sathi> oh :)
<Hipster_Brony> 8pedobear is a generic child predator
<Hipster_Brony> 8he doesnt discriminate based on gender
<leverage> Ah, I was wonder, because all the pedobear images I've seen involve girls
<leverage> Might be because internet is all guys though, esp. on 4Chan
<MrPoniator> Yeah, pretty much
<MrPoniator> And that's pretty much why I think pedobear as straight
<leverage> Same
<NewDCD> So

<Espeon> 06lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's like FEAR but better |D
<NewDCD> I'm worried over the fact Sprinkles hasn't arrived yet
<Hipster_Brony> 8hes never here this early on saturdays
<lighty> Thats not cheating
<lighty> Tjats pure strategic thinking
<Hipster_Brony> 8he usually doesnt show up until after 1:30
<Hipster_Brony> 8at least
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I saw that before, AE. :P
*Shadow_Lugia 6has a legitimate Shiny Aron just for that. XD
<prince-dari> Sprinkles started streaming about 6 hours before the stream was due to start yesterday.
<Donitz> good leverage
<prince-dari> Yeah, he has quite a lot of leverage.
<Hipster_Brony> 8more than 6 hours XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8he startde streaming at like 9:30 am
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also, just got DW Espeon with pretty good IVs in all stats apart from Sp. Attack
<Angel_Espeon> 13Timid nature and 31 IVs in speed
<Angel_Espeon> 13which is what I wanted, but
<Angel_Espeon> 13how much will those bad IVs on sp attack affect it? D:
<Vinyer> 12SilverSonic~~~
<Espeon> 06Special attack is kind of Espeon's thing, but I'm not the one to ask |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah I was aiming to get amazing stats in speed since I know that espeon's sp attack is naturally its highest stat anyway
<Angel_Espeon> 13but the IVs are terrible |D
<SilverSonic> Vinyer~~~

<leverage> I gotta say, were it not for the leverage, last nights BMN would probably have been the worse
<Vinyer> 12making his opinions invalid
<LoneWolf414> is it because he's mainstream?
<Vinyer> 12:)
<drf|away> 03I already have enough to do
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Firefox is borking. :|

<drf|away> 03so of course you'd beat me
<lightumbreon> 06i figured xD
<Espeon> 06One thing I love is people who have insane gamerscore / rare items / UNUSUAL HATS
<Espeon> 06but SUCK at the actual game
<drf|away> 03LOL
<drf|away> 03I'm not terrible at the games I have all the achievements in
<lightumbreon> 06of course, to be hoinest NO ONE has ever beaten me in a UT game
<drf|away> 03I'm not necessarily GOOD either
<lightumbreon> 06and i mean, no-one
<SilverSonic> lol does anyone know of the 11 year old from the UK that bought way too much off of XBL
<Espeon> 06Not saying that either, but especially with the unusual hats in tf2
<Ray> 02<lightumbreon> of course, to be hoinest NO ONE has ever beaten me in a UT game
<Ray> 02You
<Ray> 02Me
<Ray> 02UT
<Ray> 02Now
<Espeon> 06speaking so much trash and they probably haven't spent more than 10% of their game time outside of trading servers

<Espeon> 06Role playing games know to make the silliest achievements sometimes
<HyperMetalLugia> Most gamers are trash talkers
<lightumbreon> 06hehe
<drf|away> 03I generally just admit to not being very good
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Sathi> hmm anyone else got kicked / booted from the chat?

<Ray> 02I don't zoom lol
<Espeon> 06trash talking isn't bad as long as it's relatively friendly competition and not outright sh*t talking :P
<drf|away> 03I play for fun, not to get lots of wins
<Ray> 02I use another playstyle
<Sathi> could not connect at all
<Ray> 02xD

<drf|away> 03collecting achievements != being a pro
<HyperMetalLugia> As that is the most fun D:

<Espeon> 06I love telling people who say that they are pro that they aren't unless they play for cash
<rubenflonne> nah your just going crazy
<Espeon> 06For some reason it makes them upset to hear a proper definition of a word :P
*Espeon flops
<drf|away> 03who plays for cash o_O
<drf|away> 03that seems silly to me
<Ray> 02A lot of people, lol
<Nerpy> Big time.

<drf|away> 03hence proving my theory that the majority of people are stupid.
<Espeon> 06stuff like
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Quanyails> 7Competitive versus pro?
<SirSprinkles> 6Unless we do an event, yes.
<Quanyails> 7On a random note, my bedroom window is a natural beetle trap.
<french> Ok shame I missed all of them upto last week
<Quanyails> 7Beetles drop in, and they can't fly out.
<Nerpy> I just down right missed all of them.

<Feather|TF2> 10XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Trolols
<prince-dari> Why would you kill beetles?
<prince-dari> Beetles are awesome.
<Nerpy> for 23 minutes.
<Quanyails> 7I don't intentionally kill them. O_o
<french> I think we can do that ^.^
<SirSprinkles> 6We watched Gummy for over two hours last week...
<prince-dari> [18:35] <drf|away> kill them all >:|
<Quanyails> 7My window just happens to act as one when it's closed.
<drf|away> 03wait
<drf|away> 03what
<drf|away> 03prince-dari
<drf|away> 03are you using background colors
<french> i see how leverage went crazy...
<prince-dari> Maybe, it's inconvenient to switch it off when going back and forth between servers.
<drf|away> 03oh
<drf|away> 03OK
<leverage> How'd I go crazy?
<Quanyails> 7Another server that allows background colors?
<drf|away> 03was going to say, that's not allowed here.
<Quanyails> 7And I thought we were flexible. O.o
<drf|away> 03though, are you using mIRC?
<french> watching gummy for 2 hours?
<Sathi> 7yep.
<drf|away> 03there's a simple script fix to make it not use background colors here.
<prince-dari> I don't go on any other servers that don't allow background colours. O_o
<Quanyails> 7Why, light?
<RETARD_ONE> there we go
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'm using mIRC.
<Sathi> 7last pre-show we watched 2 gummies for 2 hrs
<drf|away> 03TST is the only place I've ever been to that DOES allow colors
<Nerpy> My friend watched epic jazz guy for over 4 hours
<RETARD_ONE> oh, i'm on UT now, litterly
<leverage> Oh, I wasn't here for last weeks show :P
<drf|away> 03most IRC channels are just plain text.
<Nerpy> And Nyan cat for over 16
<Quanyails> 7literally?
<RETARD_ONE> UT has a irc client build in
<drf|away> 03yes literally.
<RETARD_ONE> in the multiplayer section
<Sathi> 7that long Nyan cat.. and kept your sanity?
<drf|away> 03on *:INPUT:#SilverWings: if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(3),03,$1-) | halt }
<Quanyails> 7I was talking to light.
<Nerpy> What?
<Nerpy> I never said he kept his sanity
<french> i'm assuming he webt mad
<prince-dari> Wow, I've never seen allow any colours, and all the ones I go on don't stop you from using background colours either. O_o
<drf|away> 03just replace that #silverwings to like
<Sathi> 7hehe
<drf|away> 03!#Silverwings
<drf|away> 03or something
<Nerpy> He does that...
<SirSprinkles> 6I watched Nyan cat for 25 hours... I regret nothing.
<leverage> I have listened to Epic Sax man for 5 hours straight though
<Nerpy> :D
<HyperMetalLugia> bai :<
<leverage> Nyan Cat for 10
<Nerpy> I still want to marathon the longest video on youtube with my friend.
<french> i tried 10 hours, gave up after 25 mins
<Sathi> might dc updating virtual box
<Sathi> if so brb
<prince-dari> Meh, I think I'll just use $active in the current colour script I have.
<french> I have been playing jazz nyan non stop on my ipod now for 3 days now though...
<SilverMane> So... Pirate time?
<drf|away> 03whatever you prefer. Just letting you know you can;'t use background colors here :P
<drf|away> 03you can use that dark blue if you want though
<Nerpy> Fitting
<prince-dari> Ohai SilverMane.

<SilverMane> Of course not, you'd have been fitted for your bridal dress first
<prince-dari> To be honest I like black best.
<prince-dari> But I have to use colours on one place to stand out.
<drf|away> 03>attention wh*re
<leverage> >Bridal dress
<prince-dari> Nah, it's because I'm a mod, and there are up to 300 people talking at once. :P
<leverage> >Possible pun detected
<prince-dari> The non-mods aren't allowed to use colours.
<SilverMane> inb4 Leverage Spam
<prince-dari> So people can see when mods are talking.
<Srake> sigh leverage
<drf|away> 03heh
<drf|away> 03that's...weird
<drf|away> 03I'm used to mods being treated as normal members of the community, not gods :P
<prince-dari> Meh, it's a good system, it works.
<prince-dari> Well if you saw the turbo chat there, you'd understand.
<Pattyrick|away> so you can't see the orange text I set?
<prince-dari> No one would ever see what you said in just plain text.
<drf|away> 03I'd probably derail it in seconds.
<prince-dari> Derail it? LOL
<drf|away> 03yeah
<drf|away> 03as in start talking so much people are like o_O

<Sol> Ogod, that sounds like a bad OVA
<DSNesmith> I raised my daughter in the Leverage fashion
<Hipster_Brony> in retrospect, we should have saved this to show parts 1 and 2 on back to back days as a special event

<Ghosties> 4It needs a lot of leverage
<SilverLeaf> Oh Hai
<CAJ> Q.;
<Sathi> 7all lotr BMN then?
<DSNesmith> it needs to have about 20% mroe leverage
<Strake> Oh hai

<SirSprinkles> 6It's one each night.
<Hipster_Brony> those movies are long as hell though
<Hipster_Brony> maybe just 2 eps
<CoffeeGrunt> NOOO
<SirSprinkles> 6 2 eps is fine.
<Ghosties> But unlike Godfather, Hip, they're entertaining
<CoffeeGrunt> Oh it's back
<SilverLeafizzle> ahaha!
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties: both are entertaining
<prince-dari> Damn, my internet's being really laggy today.
<SirSprinkles> 6Plus it'll give us something to have a lotto for the previous week.

<MrPoniator> Those faces creeped me
<Ghosties> 4If not then you just don't know the pleasant feeling of busting some poor chap through his store window while you curse in his face
<Nerpy> I played godfather 2...
<CAJ> video games are too manestream for hipster_brony
<Nerpy> Pah
<Ignaesia> IIRC on the Godfather game, the first mission is to beat up those punks who beat that guys daughter from the beginning
<Nerpy> At that time people where still hooked on CodWarfare2
<DSNesmith> has the movie started yet
<Nerpy> yes
<Darf14> si
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<MrPoniator> Sadly, yes
<SilverMane> Well, ex~cuuuuuuuuuse me Princess, but this movie needs more leverage... sir.
<DSNesmith> looks like this is still the premovie
<MrPoniator> Because I know people want to see this scene ten times over
<DSNesmith> waiting for people to start getting shot
<Ghosties> 4I know exactly what this movie needs
<JustCallMe_Srake> They had leverage
<Hipster_Brony> 8cool story bro
<DSNesmith> explosions?
<Eldrad> waiting for leverage
<Skor423> More Leverage?
<Ghosties> 4http://instantbutton.me/buttons/ds2_20110710044121.html
<Nerpy> I would rather watch alot of plot than if they just shoved the action down our throats.
<Darf14> it needs more killing
<SilverMane> i just used 3 weeks of references and attempted memes
<DSNesmith> DSII button makes everything better
<Ghosties> 4Yes it does
<JustCallMe_Srake> ummm what?
<SilverMane> that button needs to be put over all death scenes
<Skor423> I dont get it.
<Nerpy> http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/
<JustCallMe_Srake> What was that sound effect
<DSNesmith> who's streaming
<Sathi> 7wb is it fixed?
<Darf14> Did I hear Deathstalker 2 music?
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, you have to get it cued up for the luca brazzi scene
<Ghosties> 4If this movie had Deathstalker and the Deathstalker sound effect, it'd be instantly gratifying
<Ignaesia> Oh god the rape sound effect!
<DSNesmith> whoever's streaming needs to play DSII over all the sound effects
<Eldrad> it needs more leverage
<JustCallMe_Srake> That surprised the fuck out of me
<prince-dari> Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going to play it at certain parts.
