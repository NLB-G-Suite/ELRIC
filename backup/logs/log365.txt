<Rainbowjack> cool
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stop.
<DerpyPie> PINKIE
<pinkiederp> YES!!!! YESS!!!!!!
<Red_Pegasus> I thought in G3 they called Rainbow dash Firefly.
<pinkiederp> PINKIE PIE IS BEST PONY (AND DERPY)
<MasterBrony> WRONG
<pinkiederp> F YEAH PINKIE PIE
<Midnight_Fire> Firefly was G1
<d3rb> firefly was g1?
<TOY_PON3> yes
<MasterBrony> LUNA IS BESTEST PONY
<otakon> yes she was
<pinkiederp> touche'
<DerpyPie> I <3 :P :O
<otakon> that's who Faust based RD off of
<TOY_PON3> mfw
<pinkiederp> Agreed
<jffry890> well i take it the movies not starting for a lwhile so im out
<Red_Pegasus> Pinkie was based off of Suprise.
<Midnight_Fire> In G3 Rainbow Dash was called Rainbow Dash
<otakon> but she couldn't USE Firefly bc of copyright issues
<Rainbowjack> Thanks i loved that yes i wassnet here from the start
<otakon> so she used RD and made her a pegasus
<d3rb> and she always dressed in style :D
<Dashie_Dashie> RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE.
<Dashie_Dashie> :3
<Red_Pegasus> She could use Applejack though.
<otakon> and made Pinkie a Earth Pony
<pinkiederp> in G3 RD was diva
<pony_666> swag
<djackson> hey a;;
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie always dresses in style
<d3rb> swag.mov
<djackson> all*
<DerpyPie> What are they talking about exactly? :|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Faust couldn't use some G1 names and styles.
<Midnight_Fire> In G4 G3 Rainbow Dash is called Rarity
<pinkiederp> G3 pinkie pie was earth pony, but her G1 character, Surprise was Pinkie pie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Else, Pinkie Pie would be Surprise and Rainbow Dash would have been Firefly.
<pinkiederp> in pegasus form
<TOY_PON3> Eeyup
<pinkiederp> stuff idk
<Red_Pegasus> She could only use Applejack from G1, G2 of or other gens.
<otakon> eeyup
<d3rb> suprise would have been awesome
<Kencolt> This is probably a good thing. Were Pinkie a unicorn-- the mind recoils. Someponies should not have magic.
<pinkiederp> yeah
<otakon> Kencolt: your not kidding
<Midnight_Fire> Scary thought
<pinkiederp> Sweetie Belle is best Crusader
<pinkiederp> :S
<TOY_PON3> I agree
<pony_666> sinkie + magic = discords world - discord
<pinkiederp> :S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S

<Midnight_Fire> Sweetie Belle is cutest Crusader. Scootalo is best Crusader
<d3rb> no love for apple blooom?

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Was their favorite video games discussed?
<Meanwhile> Hey SuperBrony64.
<Kencolt> Somehow I can't see Celestia presiding over the ritual slaughter of pigs. Ponies will, sadly, never know the joys of bacon.

<TOY_PON3> otakon: Because you keep leaving to get drinks
<pony_666> bacon is probably like kokaine for ponies
<otakon> oh har har
<Amras0000> question: will the mane6 channels be closed again tomorrow?
<TOY_PON3> :D
<mooncake> ponies are vegetarian.
<Meanwhile> Out of interest, and tell me if it's none of my beeswax, but what's the basment for?
<bloomberg> ponies don't eat bacon :o

<otakon> if Pinkie ate bacon, she'd explode
<TopHat> damn

<Rainbowjack> and what are there favorite pony episodes
<pony_666> they shouldn't, but they do
<Amras0000> I was hoping for a definite answer
<DainbowRash> I've got a question. Have you guys got any favourite songs in the show? If yes, which ones?
<bloomberg> otakon: can you do that?
<pinkiederp> dooo doooooo
<d3rb> can ponies do that, can they explode twice?
<TopHat> ask a mod
<Amras0000> from an op, or something like that

<pinkiederp> prepare for lag
<Lucid> And, I dinged again. What in the wide world of physics is going on?
<pinkiederp> *cracks knuckles*
<TOY_PON3> First FF I played was 7
<Jim> Glomp piles of wub
*bloomberg likes the way moop thinks
<Morty> what is this I don't even
<Meanwhile> Sometimes I do not want a hug.
<Meanwhile> This is one of those times.
<otakon> pony_666: you need emulators, I can give you a place to find them
<moop> pony_666: we are forever together alone
<LooptyHoop> did you think Sephiroth was the coolest ever?
<pony_666> :)
<otakon> FF 7 was good
<otakon> but so much EMO
<TOY_PON3> ^
<pinkiederp> dude he just sounded like homer
<Kencolt> I bought my original PS1 specifically to play FF7 and Lunar: Eternal Blue.
<Dken2021> try final fantasy 4, you don't have to level grind that much in the beginning
<pinkiederp> simpson that is
<pony_666> otakon, like emulatorzone?
<moop> bloomberg
<DeathStar> I like kingdom hearts bc i'm cool
*Ictiv joins with the rest of the chat giving one massive, visible-from-space style hug to Meanwhile.
<otakon> Kencolt: Lunar remake was perfect
<LooptyHoop> FF4 is tough though. Be wary
<moop> bloomberg: why do u like the way i think?
<Dashie_Dashie> I think I broke SuperBrony64.
<LooptyHoop> FF6 has a larger story and cast.
<Dashie_Dashie> o___O
<Dken2021> well the DS version that is
<otakon> pony_666: nah, CoolRom is better
<MrDrProfIshBestPony> Y U No Liek Black Holes?
<Kencolt> Wait-- no, I mispeak-- I played Lunar on the Sega CD. It was a LONG time befoer I got to play it on the PS1 remake.
<TOY_PON3> Dashie_Dashie: Y would you do that?! :'(
<otakon> I don't like black holes
<pony_666> i tried emulator before, but my pc crashed
<Meanwhile> I played FF7 once, and I don't remember names, characters, plot, the bad guy, or anything else important. But I do remember that the main guy had stupid hair.
<Dken2021> the original snes version was pretty much easy mode
*bloomberg retracts his previous moop-related statement?
<otakon> Kencolt: I said the remake was perfect
<Randomnerd> Hehehe
<LooptyHoop> That was the US version. They dumbed it down and took a lot of features out.
<Dashie_Dashie> Rarity is now marshmellow.
<moop> Could i get arrested if i tld u guys here that i pirate games?
<otakon> Dken2021: the US FF4 WAS on easy mode
*Meanwhile repels hug with the force of dispassion.
<pinkiederp> Party For One is best episode
<Morty> what episode are they talking about?
<moop> bloomberg: :'(
<otakon> moop no, just don't say it out loud
<TOY_PON3> Rarity is best marshmeloow
<FOURstarSKILLS> Btw the program is TINYCHAT
<pony_666> u guys beleive colliding black holes makes wormholes or what?
<otakon> Lesson Zero
<alexxm> what movies are we watching friday
<Starflash> oh btws
<LooptyHoop> But the GBA version they put all the stuff back in and got a better translation.
<Kencolt> I can't quite agree, Otakon. Visually better, smoother-- but the bosses were way easier on the PS1. the Sega CD version of Borgan was a BEAR to beat.
<Starflash> europonies are awesome
<otakon> I LOVE The Last ROundup
<TOY_PON3> Mine is Lesson Zero
*Jim gives Starflash a Eurobrony brohood /)
<MrDrProfIshBestPony> I just wanted to spread the luv with hugz
<Dken2021> GBA was an awful port though
<TOY_PON3> Nope
<pony_666> any ep with CMC is best ep
<Starflash> Jim (\
<MrDrProfIshBestPony> :(
<otakon> Kencolt: you obviously never fought the last boss at level 49
<Midnight_Fire> Mine is also Lesson Zero
<Kencolt> And Zophar-- oh WOW, was Zophar tough on Sega CD. Drive you CA-RAZY.
<bloomberg> The CMC in the talent show was so painful to watch :(
<otakon> Blazing Saddles, MY PICK!
<TOY_PON3> My best weekend was IP man
<moop> bloomberg: Y U NO LIKE MY THOUGHTS?
<Starflash> you should be able to ping everypony with "Everypony" or something

<TOY_PON3> Paying for Bronystate?
<pony_666> man, i get like half a gram of weed per moth instead
<Red_Pegasus> Mods, why nou download Desktop ponies?
<MrDrProfIshBestPony> Ictiv the difference is now they're scamming you out of money
<d3rb> i think its more to help with bills they have to pay
<prince-dari> Guys.

<Jim> O U
<prince-dari> :P
<MasterBrony> @ Nittany_Discord i will trade you $300 for admin powers
<Dken2021> <batman> wha?

<Midnight_Fire> Trying to bribe the mods?
<pony_666> is that street(school) price for us.. $10 per gram?
<MasterBrony> not trying
<pony_5943> Potassium.
<flutter_spin> So if we don't pay, we can't ... wait, what? So what does silver get?
<TOY_PON3> Nittany_Discord: I'll pay but only because I love Bronystate

*TOY_PON3 is so confused
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MasterBrony: I'm not a girl.
<MasterBrony> Nittany_discord says we are going to have to start paying for brony sstream
<moop> I cant tell if this is a joke or not
<Kencolt> Legally it has tobe a troll. TO charge any fee would violate so many copyright laws Bronystate would be burned instantly.
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: you are now!
<pony_666> no money, only weed and alcohol, so I send you 1 gram per 2 month
<flutter_spin> I guess it doesn't matter to much anyways. I'm here because I'm sick.

<Polydunami> XD
<LooptyHoop> oh so they had the same names through all the generations?
<flutter_spin> Yeah, I have weird tastes. I guess I wanted more of a fantasy storyline.
<HyperDrive> I remember watching that one Christmas G3 my little pony episode on Nick once.
<flutter_spin> Which is why I prefer Dragonshy or Secret of Excess
<pony_5943> SMOOOZE
<Krakass> Dat dance
<ThunderChaser> RPFL!
<Red_Pegasus> LooptyHoops No, in G2 Pinkie was named Surprise.

<Red_Pegasus> *Hay*
<Ingwaz> Maid_Discord: i think you're right, but since pinkie was originally surprise for FiM, shes pretty much canon
<Hydrazine> lawl
<Polydunami> Same here Saxy
<qwerty1223> lol
<TOY_PON3> SaxyPretender: Good for you :P

<Red_Pegasus> Thats what you call a nut cracker!
<PonyGirl_82> Another film? Cool!
<Meanwhile> Other than that I found the same twitter account belonging to someone named Dariana
<owlicious> and white powder
<HyperDrive> BA DUM CHING
<Muffins> Really guys, there are men with extreme boners and you're talking about Baby Cakes?
<flutter_spin> I guess because it reminded me of the Incredibles extra scene of the babysister taking care of the superhero
<moop> Pinkie Pie made baby cakes work

<Deepthought> How about just put all of season one on.
<Hazard3> Rainbowjack i mean
<flutter_spin> Twilight room was fine. Think Pinkie Pie room was good too. Chat was calm on spoilers
<Kencolt> Pretty hilarious-- and seeing the CMC actually fix one of their mistakes was granting hope.
<bluestrom_S> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PHENQiJFzI
<Red_Pegasus> Is the stream over?

<flutter_spin> The marathon was kind of surprising for me. Luna Eclipsed got first place.
<Hazard3> yeah!
<Midnight_Tempest> i think the streamer is taking a break... getting food, or drink... or something
<otakon> like midnight showings of Rocky Horror Picture Show
<otakon> where everyone dresses up
<mario_pony> so what are we watching?
<otakon> and basically MST3K's the movie
<Midnight_Tempest> you O___O
<Simon2> Still LimeV... :[

<Hazard3> Fallout 3 is amazing
<[SWAG]Haku> The chat is pretty active for a late night
<herostar> IM being negative at the moment
<Midnight_Tempest> fallout is amazing... BEST GAME EVER! and i mean the first one

<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: really? i might be able to find it... gimme a moment
<Hazard3> so is Super Mario 64
<[SWAG]Haku> a game
<Aircrafter> I've been wanting too play the original Fallouts but never had the chance.
<[SWAG]Haku> bioshock is a game
<otakon> herostar: it's a FPS heavy on story with customizable weapons and powers called "plasmids"
<otakon> it's pretty good
<otakon> and cheap
<flutter_spin> I don't like horror, which is why I stayed away from Bioshock and Amnesia
<Aircrafter> What sysem do you have flutter?
<Randomnerd> Who pinged me?
<Hazard3> otaken i ment the ones after Oblivion and Fallout3
<herostar> dear god i know skyrim but not bioshock
<mario_pony> lol
<Red_Pegasus> Bioshock isn't horror
<otakon> flutter_spin: Bioshock isn't that scary tbh
<RandomPony> amnesia isnt that bad
<Randomnerd> Hello, newcomers!
<RandomPony> kinda overreacting peoplle
<otakon> Hazard3: OH! Well Fallout 3 was good
<SuperBrony64> 10,02otakon: If you're not happy with what is being streamed, you're more than free to leave.
