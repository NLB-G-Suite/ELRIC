<OneTrickPony|Mandari> ^
<Zuxxez123> Had Badger Badger Badger, Strong Bad....
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> oh and PrinceDari but he is still here
<Zuxxez123> Simplier times...
<doughnutjoe> Helloooooooooo
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> hiya doughnutjoe
<Zuxxez123> Hello sir Joe.
<doughnutjoe> i am back and i need a favor :4
<doughnutjoe> :$
<Spectrum_Rush> orginators of BronyState, one Hipster_Brony and NewDCD
<Zuxxez123> Uh oh... A favor? :3
<MadSurge> Ho there, doughnutjoe!
<Moopy> So i went inside to gamestop with my mom and she was looking at these different headsets and i was looking at this headset its called the afterglow headset but the guy told me that he said that i would not bother getting it
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> NewDCD yes that was it!
<Zuxxez123> Afterglow is a horrible accesory company IMO.
<doughnutjoe> some one link me a funny pic please
<doughnutjoe> im rewarding my friend :D
<Spectrum_Rush> does anyone read for crying out flavin! http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/history/
<MadSurge> doughnutjoe: http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/271/b/4/dj_octavia_03_by_niban_destikim-d5g4ox3.jpg hope your friend likes Octavia and Vynil :D
<Moopy> But i was looking at these other headsets there were the Halo 4 headset and the black ops 2 headset so yeah
<Zuxxez123> http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/samanthasostarich/Funny/mlp-THEHERD.png
<doughnutjoe> eh thanks? :s
<Zuxxez123> Moopy: If at all possible, just get Turtle Beaches. 60 dollar ones work just as good as the rest IMO.
<doughnutjoe> Moopy halo 4 headset ftw
<doughnutjoe> get your halo on and get all the lady spartans
<Zuxxez123> http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/316/6/b/big_lebowski_ponies_meme_by_hewylewis-d4fzh30.png
<Moopy> Umm actually dude im kind of thinking getting the halo 4 headset cause me and me friends are getting it and im am also and i have to wait about a week to come out but.......the after glow headset looked pretty cool to me but i guess my mom was right about the after glow headset
<doughnutjoe> Moopy i once had a afterglow controller
<Zuxxez123> I've never used an afterglow headset, but the controllers are horrible.
<doughnutjoe> Moopy my cousin stole it
<doughnutjoe> the end
<Moopy> What that looks like a mod?
<doughnutjoe> i thought the controller was pretty cool :P
<Moopy> Hmph
<doughnutjoe> if you play in the dark
<Moopy> Pffft
<Zuxxez123> Looks cool, but that's about it, it jurts your eyes to have it on while gaming in my opinion.
<taoumi> hmm?
<Zuxxez123> hurts*
<doughnutjoe> there is an option to turn the lights of though!
<Zuxxez123> On mine, there was a way to make the lights light up, when the controller vibrated. Playing CoD or BF... Almost had a seziure fit...
<doughnutjoe> ^ that was the best part
<doughnutjoe> for me atleast
<Zuxxez123> You like to go to raves doughnutjoe? :P
<doughnutjoe> nah i just like lights :D
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> XD

<MadSurge> taoumi: that's Phase4 for you :D
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> Phase4: what program do you use for irc?
<Phase4> OneTrickPony|Mandari, hexchat, formerly xchat
<AdamTheDuck> Interesting choice in music this time around Phase4 :P
<Phase4> i like dis song
<Zuxxez123> Yeah, I suppose that makes sense. :P
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> kthnx
<Moopy> Well sorry dude im getting black ops 2 anyway........................sorry
<Zuxxez123> Dunno why you are sorry.

<Moopy> Cause i already preorded the black ops 2
<Zuxxez123> Lol.
<Moopy> The reason i said i was sorry cause im a cod fan

<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, it was posted in a skype group
<p4ngya> song name?
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-k_Eg7zXuc
<Zuxxez123> Don't be sorry because you like CoD, as long as you aren't a total dick about it, I'm fine with it.
<p4ngya> thanks
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: Really?, but it was only made an hour ago
<doughnutjoe> both halo and cod are good in their own ways
<Moopy> No i don't dick about it but yeah
<Zuxxez123> I like them both on their own merits, it's the fanbase with CoD mostly I don't appreciate.
<Moopy> hahahahahahaaha
<Zuxxez123> I know not everyone that plays the game is a total ass, but it's rare to find a good person in the batch.
<MadSurge> Zuxxez123: so I hope you appreciate this game, Kerbal Space Program :D

<NocturnalBlade> ok, i think i will go to bed for real this time :D
<NocturnalBlade> night guys
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NocturnalBlade
<OneTrickPony|birthda> night NocturnalBlade
*AdamTheDuck licks NocturnalBlade
<AdamTheDuck> ded
<Phase4> Rain, a long time
<Rain> lol
<Rain> using a cheat sheet? :3c
<OneTrickPony|birthda> lol
<Phase4> and then we waited
<Phase4> Rain, its easier than doing all the mat
<Phase4> math'
<Rain> :P
<Phase4> i went through how to do the math but its boring to do by hand
<doughnutjoe> so how many days have went by?
<Rain> is purple home?
<Phase4> blue is home
<Phase4> purple is eve
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night NocturnalBlade
<Phase4> this games venus
<Zuxxez123> ....
<Zuxxez123> I sense a certain.... Weirdness upcoming...
<Rain> oh
<Zuxxez123> :3
<Rain> I want to play the new version so bad XD
<Phase4> waiting
<Rain> what is green!? :O
<Phase4> waiting
<Zuxxez123> How much is this game?
<Phase4> waiting some more
<Phase4> Rain, jupiter
<Phase4> its called jool in this game
<Rain> can you land on it or is it actually gas?
<AdamTheDuck> ...
<AdamTheDuck> Where have I heard this song before?
<doughnutjoe> beep boop im bored and have homework so............
<AdamTheDuck> Bye doughnutjoe ?
<doughnutjoe> BYE!!! YOU SEXY BRONYS!!!!!1!!!
<AdamTheDuck> Bye doughnutjoe.
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<Spectrum_Rush> so Phase4 do any of the new planets have a... quirky nature to them?
<Phase4> stupid moon
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, eve is bright purple
<Phase4> this stupid moon
<Spectrum_Rush> Dumb Celsestial Rock Phase4 :S
<Spectrum_Rush> *celestial
<Phase4> i'm going to have to go for the next orbit
<Phase4> this is going to be super inefficent
<Rain> looks like you might be screwed, Phase4
<Phase4> Rain, porbably
<Rain> if you are you should totally space walk
<Rain> and try to direct bob into the sun without a ship
<Phase4> quicksave cheating
<Phase4> XD
<Rain> dude with that orbit
<Phase4> he has no where near enough delta-v to hit the sun
<Rain> eventually you /have/ to hit kerbin
<Zuxxez123> Whelp; I'm off to bed myself friends.
<Rain> Im not your friend, guy
<Rain> Im joing. sleep well
<Rain> joking
<Rain> damn k key not liking to be pressed
<Zuxxez123|Sleeping> I am not Candaian, I can't partake in this joke. :P
<OneTrickPony|birthda> slep well Zuxxez123|Sleeping
<Rain> Phase4, just time run until you smash into the planet :3
<Zuxxez123|Sleeping> Good night all.
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> Rain, its hard to hit the sun
<Phase4> night Zuxxez123|Sleeping
<Rain> no kirbin
<Rain> you are on an inevitable crash course
<Rain> if you just time warp
<Phase4> oh
<Phase4> Rain, that takes a LONG time
<Rain> so?
<Rain> its not like they have limited oxygen
<Phase4> as in i'd probably need to leave the game running for days
<Phase4> even on max warp
<Phase4> found an intercept
<Phase4> there we go
<Phase4> our lucky kerbonaughts are going home
<Phase4> actually its just the one
<Phase4> but still
<Rain> kerbonaught
<Rain> :p
<Rain> bob might see his family again! :D
<Rain> or he will die horribly when you realize you dont have any parachutes left
<Rain> seems it is uncertian about it
<Rain> inb4 you crash into space junk and die
<Rain> epic timing on that music
<Rain> might want to slow down now
<Rain> oh, well shit.
<Phase4> iva landing?
<Rain> I think you missed it, Phase4.
<Phase4> its fine
<Phase4> i'll land
<Rain> how?
<AdamTheDuck> Did I miss anything exciting while I was off? :3
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh Kerbin landing
<Rain> last I checked your vector was way off and said you were going into solar orbit again
<Rain> ans you have 0 thrust... >_>
<Rain> how are you in the atmosphere....?
<Rain> .........
<Phase4> Rain, it says that, but that view doesnt take atmosphere into account
<Rain> what the shit
<Phase4> atmosphere starts at 80KM up
<Rain> oh...
<Phase4> about 24KM is enough to bleed off anything under ~5KM/s
<Rain> that must have changed then
<Phase4> it never took it into account :P
<Phase4> not from what i've seen anyway
<Rain> I remember the atmosphere being much lower in the version I have
<Phase4> i'ma brb
<Rain> give us a view outside before you go
<Rain> through the window
*AdamTheDuck licks NewSuperBronyU again :3
<Rain> NO. Go away! Everything was just fine before you showed up! Go drink some coffee! With cream, or something! SHEEESH
<Rain> Lay off the beavers will ya!?
<AdamTheDuck> :S
<Rain> walk home, Phase4
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> Rain, i'll walk home over the ocean
<Ponyloverforever> Hello everypony!! :)
<Phase4> should be there in no time
<Rain> yup
<Phase4> ohai Ponyloverforever
<Rain> swim them buns into steel
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ponyloverforever
<Rain> those kerbin are kings
<AdamTheDuck> Hahaha, the Kerbals are still stranded Phase4? :3
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, eyup
<Phase4> not sure what to do now
<Rain> you just ruined their rover
<Phase4> could space some more but eve is the only place to go
<Phase4> and getting back from that is near impossible
<Rain> been to joot then? :3c
<Phase4> i've been to jool
<Phase4> not much to do there
<Rain> how did you land on a gas giant?
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4... Save the stranded kerbalnaughts? :3
<Phase4> i do want to land on one of its moons but getting back from that is even harder
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, last time i tried that the rescue exploded
<Phase4> Rain, bugs
<Rain> ah
<Rain> and eve is hard to get back from because it is like trying to do a second launch off of kerbin, right?
<Phase4> oh wow
<Phase4> eve's surface gravity is higher than kerbins
<Rain> oh jesus
<Rain> have the kerbals make a new base on eve
<Rain> so you can build a new ship
<Phase4> its escape velocity is 1KM/s higher
<Phase4> Rain, i have to build a ship that can launch of kerbin and land that on eve
<Phase4> so i need a ship ship
<Phase4> i'm not sure its possible to build something so large
<Rain> with the supplies that you spend decades gathering
<Rain> on eve
<Phase4> yeah, its like doing a return trip from mars
<Phase4> except harder
<Phase4> because you need bigger ships
<Rain> they need to impliment colonising
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: bigger ship? http://derpy.me/WFXxd
<Rain> so they can build their own ship back with materials they find on eve
<Rain> after generations :3
<Phase4> i need ideas
<Phase4> my ships are insufficent
<Rain> look up one that was sucessful?
<Phase4> and i have some big ships
<Phase4> Rain, i checked the fourm a few weeks after 0.17 was released, no one had managed it yet
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: sumi pyramid that is twice as big and with the new stuff... hey if it could reach the sun
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, reaching the sun is easy enough :P
*Panda|Sleepies wakes up
<Panda|Sleepies> *yawn*
<Phase4> oh wow
<Phase4> http://imgur.com/a/zdyVu#2 interplanetary capable
<Phase4> i am impress
<Phase4> http://imgur.com/a/qJSCQ#0
<Phase4> hmmmm
<Phase4> 1 man or 3 man?
<Rain> a return trip from the sun would be epic
<Phase4> xD
<Rain> also what is the difference?
<Phase4> Rain, cant, they've implimented heat physics
<Phase4> 3 man is heavier
<Rain> so what is the benefit of 3 man?
<JRP> Phase4: just get a mod that lets you self distruct it at any time
<Meanwhile> Allo everyone.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Meanwhile
<Phase4> Rain, nothing really
<Phase4> well if i loose a man
<Meanwhile> lose.
<Phase4> which is likely during eva
<Phase4> Meanwhile, meh
<Rain> I thought if you crash you lose all of them
<Meanwhile> I'll meh you cosmic Kerbal killer.
<JRP> Phase4: try a commodore 64 emulator
<Phase4> JRP, NO :<
<JRP> awww
<Rain> MORTAL KERBAL!
<JRP> Phase4: your hatred for retro tat
<Phase4> Rain, well yeah, but if i eva and one of them hits the ground too hard theres two to spare
<Meanwhile> Kerbals need a Scorpion skin now.
<Rain> ladder >_>
<DoctoDoctorWho> Good morning everypony!
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai DoctoDoctorWho
<Meanwhile> 'Lo DoctoDoctorWho.
<Rain> Whats so good about it, DoctoDoctorWho?!
<Rain> Im joking. good morning ^_^
<Meanwhile> So there's about...5 people in chat actually talking.
<Rain> I wonder what kind of minerals would need to be that abundant to make the ground purple
<Rain> just like old times, eh Meanwhile? ^_^
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: you're think of Sumica, he's the Kerbal killer Phase4 is uh... um
<Spectrum_Rush> also hai Meanwhile :P
<Spectrum_Rush> *thinking
<JRP> Phase4: just shove as many rockets in all directions as you can
<Phase4> i'm the kerbal... something
<Phase4> JRP, that is garuenteed to get me somewhere
<Meanwhile> Now we just need to draw the lottery results from all the lurkers Rain.
<Imperios> Pokykdgdhd
<Rain> lol, Meanwhile :p
<Phase4> ok
<Rain> I like how I have been here for near a year and only won once
<Rain> and that once that I won, someone messed with my pick :3
<Phase4> i need to get this
<Phase4> to space
<Phase4> to the ground
<Phase4> and then into space again
<Phase4> that last bit has to happen with all the fuel left in this stage
<DoctoDoctorWho> What makes this morning so good is that I got to see you again Rain, http://derpy.me/s82IA
<Phase4> that gives me enough to return to kerbin from prety much anywhere
<AdamTheDuck> DoctoDoctorWho, ._.
<Rain> practicing at home, Phase4? :3c
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D just kidding
<Phase4> DoctoDoctorWho, i dont get what you meen
<Meanwhile> As for the purple ground, you'd need the early lifeforms of the planet to be retinal based instead of chlorophyll, in theory that'd lead to a purple planet.
<AdamTheDuck> Not sure what's creepier, my licks or that meme XD
<Phase4> Rain, this thing wont work in the atmosphere :P
<Spectrum_Rush> the licks
<Phase4> too heavy
<Phase4> rocket has too little thrust
*AdamTheDuck licks Spectrum_Rush
<Meanwhile> -Courtesy of the purple earth hypothesis.
<Rain> so jet airplane?
<Rain> if the atmosphere is thicker that is
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im just messin with yall:)
<Rain> thats good, DoctoDoctorWho
<Phase4> Rain, i can use jets on kerbin and the jool moon, cant on eve
<Rain> my bf might get mad at you if you were actually trying to flirt with me x3
<Spectrum_Rush> AdamTheDuck: http://i.imgur.com/xDnDF.gif
<AdamTheDuck> There's no escaping my licks ._.
<Phase4> Spectrum_Rush, what the [apples] is that
<Meanwhile> AdamTheDuck: http://i.imgur.com/1GJE0.png
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, Adventure Time XD
<Rain> oh shit that spider
<Rain> that reminds me, Meanwhile
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Meanwhile> Mm?
<Rain> you should kinda stop doing that
<Rain> its pissing Shizuka off
<Meanwhile> Are you trying to encourage or discourage me.
<Rain> discourage
<Meanwhile> Because you're accomplishing the former.
<Rain> I dont exactly want you banned.
<AdamTheDuck> But I don't find spiders "that" scarey Meanwhile.
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<AdamTheDuck> I do live in Australia :P
<Tiberium126> How are we all tonight?
*AdamTheDuck licks Tiberium126
<Meanwhile> AdamTheDuck: Aww I'm jelly. I wish I lived there.
<Spectrum_Rush> dammit AdamTheDuck
<Rain> she sees it only as trolling, which is against the rules, which is bannable
<DoctoDoctorWho> AdamTheDuck: where the spiders are so big, they have hp bars:D
<Meanwhile> She's really got to suck it up.
<Rain> Meanwhile
<Rain> you just basically said "the mod doesnt like it? so what?"
*Tiberium126 hugs AdamTheDuck
<DoctoDoctorWho> wait, Tiberium126 is here?
<Meanwhile> Yeah I did.
<Tiberium126> I am now
<Zia> the mod isn't what matters
<Rain> alright, so Meanwhile is just trying to get banned now
*DoctoDoctorWho tackles Tiberium126
<Zia> the (admittedly overly strict) rules are
<Meanwhile> Not really. Trying to exercise my right to talk about what I want within reason is.
*Tiberium126 thinks getting tackled it fun
<DoctoDoctorWho> hi buddy!
<Rain> Meanwhile, she asked you to stop posting pictures of insects and then you just keep doing it
<Meanwhile> Because there's nothing in the rules that say I should.
<Rain> the rules do say if a mod asks you to stop doing something then you should stop
<Rain> or face a warning. after the warning you face a ban if you continue
<Meanwhile> Bloody loopholes.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, you really do have to stop the spider thing
*Tiberium126 hugs DoctoDoctorWho
<AdamTheDuck> Bbl, gonna play some KF :P
<Phase4> forget the rules, people want you to stop
<Zia> http://i.imgur.com/uwO2j.jpg fuck the po-lice~
<Rain> lady bug :3
<Spectrum_Rush> pls Meanwhile we like you, we don't wanna see ya banned over a silly thing
*DoctoDoctorWho brohugs Tiberium126 back
<Meanwhile> Can I keep the pictures of sealife?
<Spectrum_Rush> i like those
<Rain> she kinda found that insulting when you did that
<Meanwhile> Did she find it kinda insulting when I called her pretentious?
<Spectrum_Rush> don't know why, they weren't scary or shocking
<Phase4> autopilot is credit to team
<Tiberium126> Hey aussies did you hear that our Australian cops are getting Porsches now to use.
<Phase4> Tiberium126, wait what?
<fjia> PONYS!
<Zia> the cops are considered better than you
<fjia> PONYS! FOR LIFE
<Zia> they have good cars, they can have good guns
<Spectrum_Rush> the chat got muddy again
<Tiberium126> Phase4, yer NSW will be getting the first
<fjia> PONYS! FOR LIFE!
<Phase4> huh
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Zia> the govt. hates the austrailian people
<Spectrum_Rush> very muddy
<DoctoDoctorWho> fjia: (\
<Zia> cope with the circumstances
<fjia> ?
<fjia> You like ponys too DoctoDoctorWho
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02fjia: I liek poniez, but please limit the all-caps spam :)
<fjia> ok
<Rain> alright, Meanwhile. you just keep doing what you are doing. was just trying to be friendly and help keep you from getting banned
<DoctoDoctorWho> fjia: this is a brony site, everypony here likes ponies.
<Zia> I don't
<Tiberium126> Phase4, NSW will be getting them first
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<Meanwhile> Look Rain I appreciate the thought but honestly I don't like being unable to share things I like because some people are scared of bugs.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Zia: hmph, heretic.
<Phase4> Tiberium126, you said :P
<Tiberium126> 6_9
<OneTrickPony|birthda> dammit I just wasted an hour on reddit
*Zia agrees with meanwhile
<Rain> Meanwhile. if someone has a fear of knives would you wave a knife in their face?
<Meanwhile> Maybe, are they a tool?
<Phase4> ok
<Phase4> this stage is sufficent
<Rain> never mind. you answered my question.
<Tiberium126> Phase4, Its kind of a waste of tax payers money.
<Zia> I would sure as hell link them a picture of a knife
<Phase4> i need to land this on eve
<Meanwhile> Still Rain, since you asked and I don't find you entirely annoying, I'll purge my image base. No bugs.
<Rain> you know if you like gave a warning about it or something
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: I haz a question 4 you
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, hit me
<Rain> Im sure people that dont like it wouldnt be clicking it
*DoctoDoctorWho hits Tiberium126
<Phase4> hmmmmmm
*Tiberium126 where did I go wrong
<Phase4> i cant attach rockets to this
<Tiberium126> says*
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: I dont know what the added benifit to that was but okay.
<Meanwhile> Noted for future pictures of fish.
<Zia> fish are 2spooky4me
*Rain sighs
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, IDK but whats your question?
<Rain> Zia, dont be an ass.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: anyway, so are you for NLR or Solar Empire?
<Ponyloverforever> whats is this song?
*Zia stops because it's Rain, wouldn't for most anyone else
<Rain> thank you, Zia.
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, I dont care really and I dont belive in the best Pony.
<Meanwhile> Blasphemy, all hail the best pony.
<Ponyloverforever> whats the song called???
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, but if you put a gun to my head I would say NLR
<DoctoDoctorWho> This isnt a best pony question. I personally am fine with a double ruling 2, but if war were ever to break out between the 2, who would you side with.
<DoctoDoctorWho> ok
<Tiberium126> you?
<Moopy> Night everypony Moopy needs his rest so a talk to yall in the morning ok.............peace
<Tiberium126> Moopy, have a good sleep
<DoctoDoctorWho> It seems almost everypony here is siding with luna
<Moopy> thanks dude
<OneTrickPony|birthda> night Moopy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im a solar imperial myself
<RoboGerbil> id side with molestia.. wait what are we talking about?
<AdamTheDuck> Night moo-and gone
<Meanwhile> Anarchy.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile: discord's not a faction, he's incapacitated
<Meanwhile> Don't need Discord for anarchic society.
*DoctoDoctorWho points and laughs at Meanwhile's lack of leadership
<fjia> i like ponyes
<DoctoDoctorWho> fjia: we got it
<Ponyes_guy> no need to be rude
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, what about the other team..... you know the one we dont speak of
<Ponyes_guy> i just like ponyes
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: question mark?
<Tiberium126> *Ponies* hehehe I'm being a grammer nazi
<DoctoDoctorWho> ^
<Spectrum_Rush> Anarchy, lack of leadership...uh isn't that like the definition of anarchy
*Ponyloverforever dances to dubstep
<DoctoDoctorWho> Spectrum_Rush: yup, and Im laughing at the entire idea. because it is a silly one. hahaha
<Meanwhile> Tiberium126: grammar*

<Ponyloverforever> im not sick but im not well too :(
<DoctoDoctorWho> maybe, but at least Im investing im a leader that didnt get his/her ass kicked twice in the exact same fasion.
<Ponyes_guy> OK I REJOIN LIKE KICK
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: ah, THAT faction
<Ponyes_guy> ok
<Ponyes_guy> i brb

<Tiberium126> Ponyloverforever, but your ok?
*Spectrum_Rush is having an aneurysm
<DoctoDoctorWho> Spectrum_Rush: out of sheer stupidity?
<Meanwhile> I feel your pain Spectrum.
<Ponyloverforever> Timberium126: ive got a cold :'(
<Tiberium126> Spectrum_Rush, that can be deadly
<Spectrum_Rush> DoctoDoctorWho: this is not the time for refs
<DoctoDoctorWho> Spectrum_Rush: sorry.:(
<Meanwhile> Tiberium126: you don't say.
*DoctoDoctorWho slinks away
*Tiberium126 hugs Ponyloverforever
<Tiberium126> Meanwhile, But I do say :P
<Meanwhile> Tiberium126: Kind of redundant,
*Ponyloverforever hugs Tiberium T_T
<Ponyloverforever> at least i can stay off school
<Phase4> ITS FLYING
<Tiberium126> Meanwhile, shhh

<Meanwhile> Flying with the force of dreams.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: so anyway, Im a solar imperial.
<Phase4> where did my engines go
<CrimsonPhoenix> that Rainbow Tylenol
<Meanwhile> I need a biscuit or something. Brb.
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, I'm going to back stab and turn to the changelings
<DoctoDoctorWho> and I will defend her majesty against all foes, Heretic, xeno, or daemon.
<Ponyloverforever> ive got a sore throught too so its hard to eat :(
<Phase4> we didnt need those engines anyway
<Tiberium126> Ponyloverforever, hahah only liquids for you
<Phase4> i need to test landing the upper stage
<Phase4> so i need to go up
<Phase4> and then down
<Spectrum_Rush> now the question is... was Meanwhile refering to a cookie or something else
<Tiberium126> AdamTheDuck?
<Ponyloverforever> its hard to drink too cuz my nose gets runny when i drink water when i have a cold
<DoctoDoctorWho> for the strangest reason though, changlings remind me of tyranids, a lot.
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, They remind me of... umm...
<Tiberium126> DoctoDoctorWho, Tiberium infected ponies
<DoctoDoctorWho> Tiberium126: changlings? -_-
<DoctoDoctorWho> okay, I guess that works
<Meanwhile> What a wonderful world~
<Meanwhile> Too bad it's full of people.
<Phase4> Perfect
<Phase4> now
<Phase4> if it can make it into orbit
<Phase4> then its ready for a flight to eve
<Tiberium126> Meanwhile, indeed I hate humans
<RoboGerbil> changelings are kinds cool tho, think of the possibilities if you had one as a friend
<Tiberium126> RoboGerbil, explain
<RoboGerbil> Tiberium126: you want me to explain how haing a shapeshifting friend around would be awesome?
<Phase4> eyupo
<Phase4> eyup'

<Tiberium126> RoboGerbil, Yup and it has to be over 100 words

<Phase4> this will explode
<Phase4> but
<Phase4> it will launch
<Phase4> inb4 the autopilot screws it up
<Phase4> bit wobbly
<Spectrum_Rush> it sounds like RD is hacking a furball
<Jake> there we go
<Rain> Phase4, use the launch braces
<MirrorImage> *yaaaawnnnn*
<Phase4> Rain, ....nah
<MirrorImage> ugh... going to have to get used to a first shift schedule again. mornin' folks

<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush: D8 GO TO BED
<Phase4> Rain, you sure?
<MirrorImage> Spectrum_Rush - do you have school today?

<MadSurge> BOOOOOOOM
<Spectrum_Rush> ya don't say Phase4
<MadSurge> Ok, going to cook some lunch, bbl
<Phase4> it bugs it out a bit
<Phase4> the cool thing is the 'booster'
<Phase4> fully liquid and drains MOSTLY evenly
<Phase4> plus it exists as a single 'unit' that can be attched via a decoupler
<Phase4> many bugs were exploited during the production of this craft
<Phase4> anyone still here?
<Phase4> :(
<OneTrickPony|birthda> alrighty imma go to sleep now see ya Phase4
<Phase4> night OneTrickPony|birthda
<Phase4> if only your name was one shorter
<OneTrickPony|birthda> lol yea
<Cypresswolf> yep
<Phase4> ksp hates me for building this thing
<Phase4> its so hard to do anything with it
<Phase4> plus i had to construct the booster in the vab
<Phase4> bugs out when you import it into the sph
<Phase4> tf2 time
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony o.o

<Phase4> oh nvm, canadian
<Phase4> just in the aussie group
<Phase4> Rain, i dont care tbh, just want to know why he bothered to spend all that money to express his opinion to everyone on tf2
<LightTrooper105> lul
<Rain> apparently thought it was worth it
<Rain> or has a lot of cash
<Phase4> or both
<Rain> or was drunk and had a lot of cash
<Phase4> drunk people can work paypal
<Phase4> ?
<Rain> some can
<Phase4> i cant get it to work sober

<RaveBrony> What is the best medic heal gun?
<Meanwhile> Usually the default one.
<RaveBrony> Ah, ok
<Meanwhile> Kritzkrieg isn't bad, but the quick-fix is relatively useless.
<ofna01> I GOT DA KRITZ
<Meanwhile> Of course, any of them are good if you can use them properly.
*ofna01 is downloading steam hoping it doesnt get 1fps on a macbook
<ofna01> TF2*
<Meanwhile> All dat crate.
<RaveBrony> Meh, i have a strange quick-fix, i have no clue where i got it from. Just wondering if I could sell it.
<RaveBrony> I suppose i will :$
<ofna01> My computer which had TF2 has a bad graphics card, so i have to use my laptop now :(
<Meanwhile> You can probably find someone who'll trade for that.
<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<ofna01> and by bad graphics card i mean the card is ded
<RaveBrony> Ill take a look around
<Meanwhile> Trade server's your best bet.
<RaveBrony> ofna01: You must get new one! D:
<ofna01> so if i turn down the quality do you think it will be playable on a Macbook?
<RaveBrony> I just use outpost, lol.
<dishwasher1910> hello
<Meanwhile> 'Lo.
*RaveBrony fears face-to-face/talking trade :D
<ofna01> 3 hours for it to download
<ofna01> Thats not bad
<RaveBrony> Dat high-five taunt.
<ofna01> ohmahgerd my macbook has over 100 gigs of space O_O
<RaveBrony> :P
<ofna01> I don't always wear hats, but when i do, i wear my White gibus.
<ofna01> Stay hatty my friends
<RaveBrony> :D
<Meanwhile> I always wear hats. And it's usually my bill's. :I
<ofna01> I have a Meet the Medic taunt
<ofna01> i literally got it in a drop xD
<RaveBrony> Im thinking of buying dups of some hats and painting them Christmas colors.
<RaveBrony> :3
<ofna01> Rave, you should give me a hat
<RaveBrony> How long have you been playing tf2? :o
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZouYNu3Z6k

<Meanwhile> Pinkamena in this game is like Nocturne from LoL.
<RaveBrony> You could at least have enough metal to craft a random one.
<ofna01> Nope
<ofna01> not even 1 ref
<RaveBrony> ._.
<ofna01> I'm still a F2P
<RaveBrony> Oh
<ofna01> I believe i have a Fancy Fedora
<RaveBrony> But still, i dont have any hats to trade atm.
<ofna01> but thats for my Gentlespy set
<RaveBrony> I need my damn # 40 crate to stop dropping so it skyrockets in price! :D
<RaveBrony> THEN ill have hats to spare
<ofna01> I have like 5 of those...
<RaveBrony> Salvaged?
<ofna01> Nope
<RaveBrony> :P
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, trolololol
<ofna01> I have all of the 40's
<RaveBrony> Salvaged # 40 goes for 12keys atm
<ofna01> and i think 1 #30
<RaveBrony> People expect it to get to 16+
<ofna01> >12 keys
<ofna01> >crate
<ofna01> lolno
<ofna01> I'm not paying 12 keys for a crate
<RaveBrony> Its a Salvaged crate (super-rare)
<RaveBrony> The some stranges are worth more than the crate itself :P
<Meanwhile> Metal gear!
<RaveBrony> *Then some
<ofna01> I might pay that much for a HAT, but considering the gamble you take when opening crates, it isn't worth it...
<RaveBrony> Meh
<ofna01> I'm gonna change my steam download location
<ofna01> one sec
<RaveBrony> If I sell my crate for 16 keys, ill have enough to get everything I want in tf2 :3
<Phase4> theres a quater second ping
<Phase4> so half a second lag
<Phase4> i cant do any close encounters because i will die before my client knows i've died

<Sylandest> we'll still be here for ya, Dark92Enigma :)

<Dark92Enigma> so, i will be using this little gadget at my mom's house, where i am right now
<Dark92Enigma> Sylandest: thanks :)

<Dark92Enigma> well, since Silverscreen is gone, i'm gonna take on that movie this way: I'm gonna watch it on YouTube, come up with a few jokes, be sure if another critic reviewed it already, tell some jokes of my own (like in MST3K) write them down and post them to Microsoft Word, and them copy/paste them here.
<Dark92Enigma> there might be textwalls, like the one above ^
<Dark92Enigma> In fact, i'm gonna watch it right now.....It's time.....

<MadSurge> Hey Wrek!
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Dark92Enigma: what are you talking about?
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> YOu mean AJisAwesome winning?
<Dark92Enigma> Which is why Shizuka changed the voting mode for the episodes
<Dark92Enigma> Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH: i meant, that this episode was played ALMOST. EVERY. WEEK.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Oh
<Dark92Enigma> Don't get me wrong, i like it, but........when was the last time we saw......RETURN OF HARMONY?
<Dark92Enigma> I mean here
<MadSurge> I'm going to the pool in two hours, I'll be dead tired after that :D
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: I'd vote for that, but then we would have to watch both parts
<Wrek> 05http://i.imgur.com/7XHLf.jpg
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: remember when we watched A Mare In The Moon here?
<Dark92Enigma> that was part 1

<Dark92Enigma> and we finished movie night
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: ok
<MadSurge> OH NO, YOU ENDED ON A CLIFFHANGER! YOU BASTARDS :D
<Dark92Enigma> the same thing could happen to Return of Harmony or A Canterlot Wedding
<Dark92Enigma> if they show their respective part 1's
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: just end on Cadance burning Twilight :D
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: dat cliffhanger
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: I see why they opted to jump a week to show both parts back to back
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: it gets even darker when you put a BGM from Saint Seiya (Knights Of The Zodiac)
<MadSurge> *jump, or skip
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: Yeah, i see that
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: Ah yeah, I remember that series
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: anyway the BGM is called ''Direction Of Heated Fights''
<Saturn> 08,01so apparently, Gangnam Style is #1 in the UK charts
<Saturn> 08,01which is just... mind blowing
<Saturn> 08,01considerign how xenophobic the UK is
<Sylandest> its a damn good song though, Saturn

<Dark92Enigma> Oh yeah, GANGNAM STYLE seems to be the bomb
<Hoody|School> OP OP OP
<Hoody|School> OPPA GANG
<Petrified_Discord> -nam style
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: you mean anime*? sorry, i don't want to sound like a jerk
<Hoody|School> damn you tiny computer!
<MadSurge> The really violent anime though is aired only on cable or regional channels, and that's why to this day the Fist of the North Star sucks balls :D
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: OHGOD, IT'S THIS THEME :D
<Dark92Enigma> never watched Fist Of The North Star, mainly because it was never shown in my country
<Saturn> 08,01who is streaming?

<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: then why you said it sucked balls?
<MadSurge> The local giant thug comes over and taunts Kenshiro, Kenshiro touches him and the thug explodes
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: the italian dub sucks
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: ''but first''. I think of The Mask when you say that
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: oh you live in Italy, that's why you say it aired only on cable
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: yep
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: Talk about the touch of death
<Hoody|School> You know whats better than death-touch?

<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: lol, why they couldn't use the DVD-dub?
<Dark92Enigma> Don't let Spongebob drive, thats for sure
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: because regional channels don't have the money/don't bother getting that dub :D
<Lil_B> got a Tetris Mix CD from 92 on an EbAy Auction yesterday XD
<MadSurge> Yay!
<Hoody|School> Tetris music <3

*Sylandest braces himself and holds onto Saturn
<MadSurge> Which means... HALLOWEEN :3
<Saturn> 08,01the christmas adverts HAVE STARTED
<Hoody|School> Its cancer awareness month!
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: you KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!
*Saturn 08,01hides
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: NOSTALGIAWEEN!
<Saturn> 08,01i do not like christmas
<Kandarihu> I love Christmas
<Hoody|School> ^
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> I just saw a semi drive by my place with the company name "AJ Transport LLC"
<Meanwhile> I love Christmas.
<Saturn> 08,01there's only 2 tings i like about christmas: huge fuck-off christmas feast, and giving people presents
<MadSurge> Saturn: but you still accept friends and gifts, right?
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i don't accept christmas gifts
<Meanwhile> What've you got against Christmas Saturn?
<Petrified_Discord> Christmas: bring trees inside, put lights outside
<Dark92Enigma> CHRISTMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!
<Saturn> 08,01unless they're small, simple gifts like i give
*Dark92Enigma is the most wonderful time, of the year........*
<Hoody|School> This Christmas I finally have money to get other people gifts with
<Saturn> 08,01i mean like... i give somethign i know the person will really like, and appreciate, but not something expensive, or even useful
<Lil_B> I still remember when I got my N64 for Chrismas as a kid : D it was like in the Video XD
<MadSurge> Saturn: I'd give you the equivalent of a steam game :)
<Saturn> 08,01and i don't give them to everyone i know
<Saturn> 08,01if i find somethign that fits someone, they get a gift
<Saturn> 08,01if not, i don't
<Saturn> 08,01*if not, they don't
<Dark92Enigma> i remember i got this PC and the PS2 for christmas (not in the same one, though)
<Saturn> 08,01and i don't go out looking for gifts; it's more that if i come across something suitable, i'll use it
<MadSurge> Saturn: give out plushies to your brony friends! :3
<VenHur> Hello everypony...I had nightmares the other day.
*Hoody|School always gets useless shit for christmas
<Wrek> 05ok bootin' up
<Meanwhile> But what don't you like about Christmas?
<MadSurge> VenHur: what kind of nightmares? :O
<VenHur> Oh, and hello to Saturn and Wrek.
*Sylandest hugs and greets VenHur
<Lil_B> I wonder if we could get some ncie Chrimas Stream :) for after the nowerdays short family time is over :)
<Hoody|School> ello VenHur you did not dream sweetly
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: i don't like the carols, the gratuitous commercialness, the concept of santa claus, the religious aspect, the sense of obligation to buy gifts...
<VenHur> MadSurge: Remember "Welcome To Ponyville"? ...Yeah, THAT nightmare.
<Saturn> 08,01i could go on
<Lil_B> hello VenHur :)
<Meanwhile> Scrooge. I'm an atheist and I feckin' love christmas.
<Hoody|School> I just like the presents :p
<MadSurge> VenHur: ...I don't really know, no
<Lil_B> I don't like Santa eather :/ IO got reased that ther Chrismas Angel brings the gifts, and Knecht Rubrecht collects all the badf kids :(
<Saturn> 08,01oh, and i hate the presure i'm put on every year to spend christmas with my family
<Saturn> 08,01this stems from when i was engaged
<Saturn> 08,01my fiancee would want me to spend christmas with her
<Saturn> 08,01my parents would want me to spend it with them
<Hoody|School> VenHur: Was it that nightmare where everyone had a rock for a face?
<MadSurge> Saturn: but you'd love a non-christmas party with your friends, right?
<Saturn> 08,01and, of course, i couldn't spend it with both of them, because they *hated* each other
<Saturn> 08,01realy hated each other
<VenHur> Hoody|School: No...it's worse than that.
<Hoody|School> Were you on fire? Did someone touch you?
<VenHur> I meant that creepy looking pony with that creepy face!
<Meanwhile> Sucks Saturn, sorry the holidays are so lame for you.
<VenHur> Streamception!
<Saturn> 08,01my favourite time of year is Beltane
<MadSurge> VenHur: I can only think of the SmilePinkie, unfortunately O__o
<Hoody|School> My favorite holiday is mah birfday
<Petrified_Discord> Bonfires in may? cool!
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> The best part about that pic in the lower left? I play all six of those snipers
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Also Christmas sucks
<Saturn> 08,01i celebrate my brthday
<MadSurge> Ohai Petrified_Discord!
<Saturn> 08,01alwasys with a huge party
<VenHur> My favorite holiday? F*ck it, I loved ALL of them!
*Saturn 08,01can throw a fucking good party
*Petrified_Discord votes for Halloween as best holiday
<Hoody|School> ^
<Meanwhile> I like halloween.
<Dark92Enigma> On The Internet, nobody knows you're a pony.......so true
<VenHur> Even the lesser known ones! I. Loved. Them. ALL.
<Hoody|School> Free motherfucking candy
<Lil_B> Saturn you already made a freaking good convention ;)
<Dark92Enigma> NOSTALGIAWEEN!
<Meanwhile> Or rather, I used to. Nowadays interest in it seems to be declining over here.
<Hoody|School> Shit gotta go
<Hoody|School> later
<Maid_RainBow> to old for free candy NEVER!!
<Lil_B> I really really hate Halloween
<VenHur> See ya Hoody.
<Petrified_Discord> Did you know they haven't made candy corn since 1982? They just pick it up off the street, repackage it, and sell it again next year :P
<Maid_RainBow> hi Lil_B
<Dark92Enigma> Bye Hoody|School
<Lil_B> hello there Maid_RainBow :)
<VenHur> Halloween, The pros? FREE FUCKING CANDY! The cons? Cavaties.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Petrified_Discord: I believe that.
<Sylandest> laters, everypony. Edumacation time.
<Lil_B> see you later Sylandest :)
<Saturn> 08,01VenHur: i've had a few cavities in my time
*Sylandest hugs Lil_B
<Saturn> 08,01the amount of sugar i eat, i don't think anyone's really surprised
<Saturn> 08,01you know that sick feeling you get when you eat too much sugar?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: why? You don't like trick or treaters?
<Saturn> 08,01i don't get that
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> You're dentist don't mind either.
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Your*
<Lil_B> MadSurge nope, don't like them, I'll explain
<Lil_B> inb4 my own Textwall
<VenHur> Saturn: Well, when you get too much sugar, you'll be a Pinkie Pie.
*Petrified_Discord preps for textwall
<VenHur> At least that what's I known.
<MadSurge> Saturn: I felt kinda nauseated by Red Bull once :D
<Saturn> 08,01diabetes runs in my family
<Meanwhile> Diabeetus.
<Saturn> 08,01so i know that at some point i'm going to be diabetic
<Dark92Enigma> ok, i'll be off for a while, re-watching Yu Gi Oh the pyramid of light first-hoof
<VenHur> Wrekception
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm enjoying sugar while i can
<MadSurge> Saturn: :O
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: same here, but i'm on a diet
<Lil_B> MadSurge Here in germany, this Holiday das 0 Historical backstory (there actually is already a Holdiday on that day, which now gets forgotten because of it). The Holiday is litterealy 100% Commercialy introduced and fueled, and ...
<Meanwhile> I know a guy with diabetes, he really doesn't look after himself as well as he should. :/
<Dark92Enigma> i'll still be here, but i'll see the movie on full-screen
<VenHur> I might do some pros and cons sometimes, for the lols.
<Lil_B> MadSurge We already have a Holdiday where Kids can Dress up as whatever they want and get a shit ton of candy for free
<MadSurge> Lil_B: same here :D but we don't get kids asking for candy here, except in the city squares :D
<MadSurge> Lil_B: carnival?
<Saturn> 08,01i don't actually celebrate Haloween
<VenHur> They called that "holiday" Halloween.
<Saturn> 08,01because it's the same day as (and actually based on) the festival of Sammhuin
<Saturn> 08,01*Samhuinn
<Meanwhile> How can you not want to celebrate a holiday that revolves around making people wet themselves?
<MadSurge> Saturn: it's a great period for spooky stuff and fuuny monsters though :D
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: because the festival i celebrate instead involves fire and naked people
<Saturn> 08,01and costumes
<Saturn> 08,01and holds emotional significance for me
<Lil_B> MadSurge almost identical, but here it really is more about beeing goofy
<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<VenHur> You know what might makes the experience of Halloween even cooler?
<Saturn> 08,01also, body paint
<Saturn> 08,01http://beltane.org/about/samhuinn/
<VenHur> Dead peoples rising from thier graves and doing the Thriller dance for our own entertainment.
<VenHur> Your arguement is invalid.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I like candy and monster costumes, but only the good ones and doing it for the sake of it :D
<Saturn> 08,01this is what happens at Beltane and Samhuinn: http://beltane.org/gallery/
<ofna01> more pylons
<ofna01> YOU NEED TO CONSTRUCT MORE PYLONS
<Lil_B> MadSurge I think I really just hate the fakt that it's 100% brought upon us by companies. the first time kids were going around in my village was 10 years ago just when I was grown out of that phase :/
<MadSurge> Saturn: looks like another great way to pass october 31! Also, bonfires are cool
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: it's fucking awesome
<Saturn> 08,01there's also drums
<Saturn> 08,01lots
<Saturn> 08,01of drums
<Lil_B> 31. October is the Reformation day for the evangelic People in germany, it doesn't have much significance as far as I know even for them (I'm gatholic, b ut I couldn't care less :) )
<MadSurge> Saturn: we have a bonfire celebration too, but it's to welcome spring and we have a big restaurant based on cuttlefish and other seafood :$
<Lil_B> I like lots of Drums :) I would like to see (and hear) that
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: awesome!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I like drums, but not afro drums :D
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: you're in the UK, aren't you?
<MadSurge> Saturn: no you silly, Italy! :D
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: who am i thinking of , then?
<VenHur> Oh, I like drums too...
<Lil_B> GilDash maybe?
<MadSurge> I 'unno, GilDash? :D
<Saturn> 08,01maybe
<VenHur> ...But, they're not my favorite intrument.
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, your cuttlefish festival sounds amazing
<VenHur> That honor goes to the fucking electric guitars.
<Meanwhile> Gotta love seafood.
<MadSurge> Fried fish is the shit, Saturn :$
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: as a scottish person, i approve of this
<Lil_B> I like Seafood, I hope our class has it's next go to thje Chinese Restaurant for the Buffet soon :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya guys :)
<VenHur> Hello Brovakiin.
<Lil_B> Hallo da Colt_Brovakiin :)
<MadSurge> Saturn: more visibility for my town, who is already renomated for a particular brand of kitchen salt that looks pinkish and is sweeter :)
<MadSurge> Saturn: it's basically Pinkie Salt, now that I think of :D
<Meanwhile> Mfw my milkshake describes itself as "sterilised"
<Lil_B> Meanwhile sounds good :/ means all the Bakteria and most Viruses are probably dead now
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: so long as it's not "sterilising"
<Saturn> 08,01presuming you want kinds some day
<Meanwhile> Yeah had to double check that.
<PinkiePry> Morning everypony :)
<Saturn> 08,01gah
<Saturn> 08,01i want kids
<Lil_B> hello PinkiePry
<Meanwhile> I want a pretty pink cake with my face on it.
<Lil_B> Saturn Sience!
<MadSurge> Saturn: awww :3 daddy Saturn?
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai PinkiePry
<Saturn> 08,01i'd be a great daddy
<MadSurge> This stream is becoming Burger Hill :D
<prince-dari> >have kids
<prince-dari> >life over
<prince-dari> Meh
<prince-dari> :P
<MadSurge> Saturn: No doubt about it :D
<Saturn> 08,01if i'm still in a gay relationship when i have kids, i'm not sure the route i'd want to take to have kids
<Jmo> dabi pls
<prince-dari> jaymoo pls
<Saturn> 08,01i'd probably impregnate a close friend or somethin
<MadSurge> Saturn: :D
<Lil_B> ok, found out what was wrong withn the song, the melody started opne Beat to late :P no wonder it sounded out of tune XD
<killerpony7733> Saturn Oh my
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Lil_B> hello Jmo and prince-dari
<Serenity> Seeing Wreky going MLG prop again?
<Lil_B> AND Serenity :)
<prince-dari> Ohai
<Meanwhile> Acually is dabi.
<prince-dari> ^
<Lil_B> and hi killerpony7733 xD
<killerpony7733> Lil_B Hello
<Saturn> 08,01i have a friend in california, one of my best friends of all time, and we have this agreement: if she's with a girl when she wants kids, i'll impregnate her. if i'm with a guy when i want kids, she'll carry my baby (if she can)
<killerpony7733> I be lurking
<MadSurge> Hey killerpony7733!
<Serenity> Saturn: Sounds like a nice deal :]
<Meanwhile> And if your boyfriend doesn't want kids?
<killerpony7733> Why do i get hi'd when i have been here since around 2 PM my time and it's 5 PM
<Serenity> Even if it's slightly illegal?
<Lil_B> Saturn if everyone is ok with that than I see no Problem :)
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: if he didn't want kids, i wouldn't be with him
<MadSurge> Saturn: damn, what a wonderful friend :)
<Lil_B> I don't know, Wrek doesn't seem so good right now :/
<Serenity> Also
<Serenity> What about just adopting a child
<Serenity> Would maek the sitation easier, no?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: not all matches can go well :(
<Serenity> Right
<Lil_B> Serenity some countries are really awful with adopting rights, I know it's really hard to adopt a Child in germany, whole lot of legal issues
<Meanwhile> His footmen seem way outmatched by green.
<Serenity> I'm off on WoW
<Serenity> Lil_B: Not too bad in Britain
<Meanwhile> Or blue, whichever.
<killerpony7733> Saturn Well you are pretty lucky in that respect. I'd probably never get a kid due to many factors but yeah lucky you are
<Lil_B> Serenity that's good :) I don't really get why the government is making it so hard sometimes :)
<Serenity> Because 90% of political parties are nobb'eds
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah, if most charge at you in the beginning than it's really just bad luck :(
<killerpony7733> Serenity Well just my thought but some may want a kid of their own blood ya know
<AceRanther> hi i just got here and whats goin on ponys :D
<Serenity> Donate blood to him if you're the same type :P
<Lil_B> hello AceRanther :)
<Meanwhile> And that would appear to be the end of that.
<AceRanther> hi Lil_b
<Lil_B> AceRanther you can just write part of the name and press TAB to find the names faster :)
<Lil_B> YYOu have been struck with a terrible fate haven't you
<AceRanther> powned last minute and thanks Lil_B
<Lil_B> why is the chat now so dead? -.-
<AceRanther> dunno
<AceRanther> maybe it got stabed by social life
<ofna01> right in the kidneys
<AceRanther> eeyep
<Lil_B> meh :/ just 5 min ago people were talking a lot
<Lil_B> and hey ofna01 :)
<ofna01> i was taking a nap
<Wrek> 05its cause i am streaming
<Wrek> 05people always tend ot shut up then
<Wrek> 05its like the purposley try to make me sad :C
<MadSurge> ^
<AceRanther> to
<AceRanther> not ot
<ofna01> you always get mad at us Wrek
<ofna01> it hurts our feelins
<MadSurge> We're in awe, Wrek :P
<Dken2021> lali-ho y'all
<JRP> wrek the graphics on the snes port of doom are really gabage
<Meanwhile> Would you rather we were all quietly watching or having our attention focused on talking about something else Wrek? :P
<Lil_B> the Jaguar Port of DOOM is the best Port, but has no music XD
<JRP> most doom ports were based off the source code of the jaguar port
<MadSurge> Hello Dken2021!
<Lil_B> ... reminds me... I wanted to rerip the Music Samples from the SNES VErsion again with lover Frequenzy so I don't have to manually strech all the Samples -.-
<Lil_B> hi there Dken2021 !
<Dken2021> hey there MadSurge and Lil_B, how are ya?
<JRP> dont get me wrong but the snes port had awsome music
<Lil_B> I'm fine :)
<AceRanther> hi Dken2021 ;)
<Lil_B> listening to some intense Moonsonate 3rd movement XD \m/
<MadSurge> JRP: unlike the genesis port :D
<Dken2021> hai AceRanther
<JRP> snes one whaaaaaaaa awsome the megadrive / genisis one was like really cheaply made
<AceRanther> protect them attack it always works
<AceRanther> i mean then
<Lil_B> I recently ripped a lot of Music Samples from SNES games, but they are all really short (usually 1s> ) and LMMS can't strech while keeping the same Note :/
<MadSurge> JRP: the genesis one had music made by the fart orchestra :D
<AceRanther> not themprotect ur gonna lose if ya dont
<Lil_B> The Genesis actually had something like a Soundfont in the System on which all games coulkd rely on, while SNES games always had to bring their own Samples on the Cardridge
<JRP> Lil_B: wernt they ".raw*"
<Meanwhile> So how does this game mode work exactly?
<Lil_B> JRP I don't actually know, I only have the Genisis Soudnfont in SF2. I usually don't work with actually game files
<JRP> yes they were ".raw*' files because i riped some before
<JRP> like riped the write the game
<JRP> right*
<AceRanther> stupid green guy
<Saturn> 08,01holy shit
<Saturn> 08,01my hair is pink
<Meanwhile> Did you only just remember that?
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: it just surprised me
<Meanwhile> x]
*Dken2021 puts on a delayed surprised face
<Lil_B> Saturn isn't it pink since at least a month? XD
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: it's been pink since April
<Lil_B> Saturn oh,. I only knew that you died it pink for Buck, I didn't knew it was already Pink before : )
<AceRanther> kill ur ally i mean betry him befor he betrays u
<Meanwhile> It's a strange tactician who risks his allies turning on him when there are common enemies to deal with first.
<AceRanther> he comes
<Invi> moin everypony
<Meanwhile> 'Lo Invi.
<Dken2021> mornin Invi
<Saturn> 08,01 i'm eating prunes
<AceRanther> but to put a good ally to rest is to put a enemy first and he might proritise first Meanwhile
<Saturn> 08,01and drinking grean tea
<Meanwhile> That really was not a coherant sentence.
<Lil_B> Guude Invi
<AceRanther> i know i got muddled up
<Invi> :D
<Invi> moin Lil_B ^^
<Invi> What game is this?
<Meanwhile> Starcraft 2
<Invi> and who is that guy in the corner?
<Meanwhile> Wrek.
<AceRanther> but the reson is hes closer to him so its risky when fighting the ally hes made
<Meanwhile> I don't even think the alliances are dynamic in SC2.
<AceRanther> ikr
<AceRanther> kill both enemys
<Meanwhile> Meaning if you start as allies you're stuck that way. Unless I'm mistaken.
<AceRanther> but i have the game
<brodashX> hello everypony :d
<Lil_B> I really wanna play an Old RTS now -.-
<Dken2021> yo brodashX
<Invi> hai brodashX
<Lil_B> hello brodashX
<AceRanther> hi brodashX
<Invi> Lil_B, Warlords Battlecry 3 was aawesome ^^
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai brodashX
<Meanwhile> I have the game too.
<AceRanther> but with out reson only
<Lil_B> I though more along the lines of Age of Empires, Empire Earth, Cossacks, American Conquest :)
<Meanwhile> And tbh dynamic alliance isn't really a feature well applied to warfare RTS.
<Lil_B> or something more build up like the Settlers or ANNO
<Invi> Lil_B, but you can equip and skill your own hero there :3 and it's pretty cheap on ebay ^^
<AceRanther> i know
<Meanwhile> It's the type of thing you have in games that focus on civilisation without specifying conflict.
<Lil_B> Invi I bought to Much, I sumply must Stop now!
<Invi> Lil_B, :D okay then
<AceRanther> i have black and white its that sort of game
<Invi> Black and White is kinda funny, but it becomes boring too fast
<AceRanther> i know
<AceRanther> to needy
<Lil_B> maybe some ANNO 1602 or 1503 :) or if you like really tidius work, play the Partrician 3 XD
<AceRanther> powned
<AceRanther> ok
<AceRanther> has he seen the army of yellow
<Lil_B> I'd call the Partrician 3 after 10 years still the best, most Complex and well thought out Trading and building Simulation to date
<Invi> I always had too many wood guys :D
<AceRanther> ok dodjy ate sim
<AceRanther> date
<AceRanther> sim
<AceRanther> werid
<Invi> wat?
<AceRanther> build a army
<Meanwhile> an.
<AceRanther> massive army to win the game
<Meanwhile> It looks like there's a limit on the number of troops at any one time.
<brodashX> i said Eeyup to cleverbot and it sang winter wrap up WIN
<Invi> lol
<Dken2021> hehehe
<AceRanther> hmm

<Meanwhile> I never asked for this.

*Saturn 08,01begins licking the molasses off Meanwhile
<DashWithRainbows> ...

<mentallyeffedguy> yes
<mentallyeffedguy> chat is like dredd 3d with that drug....
<mentallyeffedguy> dat drug.....
<Meanwhile> It's as though chat has encountered some kind of temporal anomaly and is acting at reduced speed.
<mentallyeffedguy> yes
<Unnr> So, how is everypony today?
<Meanwhile> Bored.
<Unnr> Also, happy October!
<Dken2021> I fininshed a sweet potato pie D:
<Unnr> Dken2021: Finished as in baked, or finished as in ate?
<Kimori_mobile> hey guys

<Unnr> :<
<Meanwhile> You seem rather unhappy for someone who just ate.
<mentallyeffedguy> is there a stream? i cant tell
<Meanwhile> No I think it stopped.

<Wrek> 05leave yout thoughts on the link i put in
<mentallyeffedguy> gå og legg deg
<RaveBrony> :o
<mentallyeffedguy> anyone laik the song i linked? :D
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<RaveBrony> I saw 'dubstep' in the title and shut it off.... since im stubborn like that :\
<Meanwhile> 'Lo Malavolent.
<mentallyeffedguy> :o
<Meanwhile> What RaveBrony said.
<mentallyeffedguy> well thats sad RaveBrony, it was a cool song
<Meanwhile> Don't like dubstep.
<mentallyeffedguy> i didnt like it, but i hadnt heard anyone else then skrillex, wich is shait
<Dken2021> kinda felt the song was a bit weak
<RaveBrony> Its not fully the fact that i dont like dubstep...its more along the line of, Im sick of people commenting on Techno/Trance vidoes saying "This is the best dupstep Ive heard!/Wheres the drop? This is awful"
<mentallyeffedguy> Dken2021: starts weak, ends awesome, my opinion
<Dken2021> eh, to each their own
<mentallyeffedguy> well it
<mentallyeffedguy> ups
<mentallyeffedguy> it had a drop and it was cool RaveBrony
<Unnr> listening, starts weak, develops unoriginally, and the drop isn´t anything special. Call it a 3-4/10
<mentallyeffedguy> Unnr: you a critic or something? :P
<RaveBrony> I dont like the drop... I like techno/trance. Where the rhythm is nice and steady/repetitive
<mentallyeffedguy> we are all different you know
<Unnr> mentallyeffedguy: just have listened to far too much music
<Unnr> and that piece is competently built, but nothing special
<mentallyeffedguy> its impossible to listen to to much music, know what im sayin Unnr ?
<RaveBrony> Im not hating on it! Im glad others can enjoy it. Im just stubborn and refuse to listen to it :\
<RaveBrony> Im eclectic tho. So there will be dubstep songs here and there that ill like im sure :D
<Unnr> mentallyeffedguy: then you have never listened to a purposfully de-synched Zireeka
<Unnr> *Zaireeka
<mentallyeffedguy> Unnr: is it bad?
<RaveBrony> I even listen to some yodeling now, ffs :D
<Meanwhile> Yoda-lay-hee-hoo
<RaveBrony> :D
<mentallyeffedguy> anyone here enjoy listening to justin bieber?
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Dken2021> Boop-Oop-A-Doop
<Unnr> mentallyeffedguy: Zaireeka is a four disk album by The Flaming Lips that is created so that you play any combination of the disks together to get the songs
<mentallyeffedguy> Unnr: and i guess you put them together in a shitty way?
<JRP> guys im still watching it

<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> Hi, BladedWings :)
<Dken2021> 'noon to ya BladedWings
<Invi> hi BladedWings
<CrazyCherry> SpadeMagnes[R]: How is "You only live once" retarded?
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> SpadeMagnes[R]: I liked MMX Command Mission, just wish the VAing in it was better.
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[R]: its easy. Its an excuse to make retarded things. nothing more.
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> CrazyCherry: The way it is implemented is idiotic.
<CrazyCherry> Hello BladedWings, I'm still keeping an eye on you.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The concept is people use it is for bullshit excuses
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its basically a excuse to do stupid shit
<BladedWings> CrazyCherry: what are you, a zombie?
<Invi> SpadeMagnes[R], the concept itself is good, but peoples are retarded >.>
<CrazyCherry> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Carpe Diem is a much better alternative.
<CrazyCherry> BladedWings: Maybe. >_>
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlV6sFcMtcA&feature=relmfu
<BladedWings> CrazyCherry: it would be the only way you could keep an eye on me :D
<CrazyCherry> BladedWings: Maybe not the only...
<twilight_sprinkle> YOLOMLG360NOSCOPESWAG
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sonic 3 and K has alot of glitches
<SpadeMagnes[R]> but you have to really go out of your way for them
<twilight_sprinkle> also, im looking for contributions to that word
<BladedWings> well anyway...wait why are you keeping an eye on me again CrazyCherry
<SpadeMagnes[R]> One glitch fucks up the game so bad it speeds up the music and slows down the gameplay
<CrazyCherry> BladedWings: Bladed wings...
*BladedWings looks at his wings "oh yea XD"
<AJIsAwesome> I still love the idea of bladed wings, though.
*CrazyCherry rages. "THAT'S SUPPOUSED TO BE MY PATENT. :("
<AJIsAwesome> Seems interesting.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also fun fact, in launch base and hidden palace its possible to "destroy" Robotnik
<Invi> AJIsAwesome, like the nargacuga?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> you have to hit him 257 times though <.<
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: I saw that glitch. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Invi: Nargacuga?
<Invi> AJIsAwesome, never played Monster hunter? ^^
<AJIsAwesome> Nope. ^_^''
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have to admit I was stuck in carnival night for a bit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Stupid barrels...
<BladedWings> CrazyCherry: calm down, i'm not stealing anything
<Vordox> I FINALLY KNOW!
<Vordox> Which A movie I'll vote on for now
<Vordox> Pokemon 2000
<Vordox> Perfect A movie
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: STUPID BARREL.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You mean I had to press up and down?! UP AND DOWN?!
<Dken2021> the barrel of doom? *shivers* so... much ...wasted time :(
<Invi> AJIsAwesome, http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=nargacuga#/d1n7xu9 :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I forget how many hits does the death egg robo take in sonic 2?
<AJIsAwesome> Wow. That's pretty cool.
<Invi> ikr? ^^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sonic Jam's easy mode kills it in 3 hits
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I find it hilarious that a well made game like Sonic 3 & K has so many glitches in it
<Bronysith> i find DOOM enjoyable so far
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I fucking love the arranged version of X3's sound track

<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd2GQHkaCSI
<Dken2021> must be tons of fun there AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Sort of.
<AJIsAwesome> It's in the middle of "fun" and "boring" right now.
<AJIsAwesome> And chat slows down to a crashing halt.
<Zuxxez123> What are you majoring in AJ?
<Meanwhile> So it's...bun.
*SpadeMagnes[R] starts humming Green Greens
<Applejack2012> crash chat
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: You could say thst.
<Meanwhile> Bun sounds better than foring.
<Queen_Chrysalis> ......
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Marco
<Queen_Chrysalis> polo
<AJIsAwesome> :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I miss my Glover game...
<AJIsAwesome> I miss my Super Mario Land 2 game.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I still own that, and I am amazed my N64 still works
<Zuxxez123> I miss my PSOne and my Crash Bandicoot collection. xD
<Dken2021> I miss Legend of Legaia, even though I was too young to play it at the time
<LunasGuard> waves hello to Queen_Chrysalis
<AJIsAwesome> My PS one stopped working a couple years ago.
<Queen_Chrysalis> hi
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I still own Mario pary 1...much to my dismay
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fucking control stick minigames
<Zuxxez123> Your poor hand...
<AJIsAwesome> I was playing Monster Rancher 2 and then it crashed.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: I actually LOVED Mario Party 1 as a kid.
<Zuxxez123> Monster Rancher; LOVE that game. :D
<Saturn> 08,01huh, cool
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Doh I missed
<AJIsAwesome> ohai, Saturn :)
<Saturn> 08,01apparently, The Hub has announced that S3 will air in November
<Applejack2012> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: SEEMS LEGIT? :S
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Waluligi needs a game, he came out of left field
<Dken2021> allo Applejack2012
<Zuxxez123> Early November?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: So does Daisy.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wario's origin got sort of explained
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Waluigi is there for no fucking reason
<Dken2021> Waluigi onloy exist because wario needed a partner for tennis
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Daisy needs a better backstory. Either that or more.
<AJIsAwesome> The only backstory she got was Mario Party 3.
<AJIsAwesome> *was in
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also Smash Melee is the only game to actualy swap peach's sprite to look like Daisy
<BladedWings> SpadeMagnes[R]: i thought brawl did it too?
<Zuxxez123> Daisy had her own sprite in Brawl.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Melee did it more better, instead of a dress chance it actulaly changed its design and skin and hair color
<Zuxxez123> Meh, I never really followed the secondary characters in Mario games.
<Zuxxez123> They were just there for me.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Peach has what only 2 games where she isnt kidnapped?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> and ones she activly helps in?
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not sure if I want Sticker Star.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There was her own game, and Super Paper Mario
<Zuxxez123> Lol, besides the ones where she plays random sports, you may be onto something there Spade. :P
<AJIsAwesome> I like the fact that Sticker Star is going back to the RPG style gameplay, but I'm not sure about the sticker gimmick.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dont judge a game till you try it
<AJIsAwesome> True.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Unless its Sonic 06
<AJIsAwesome> ^:S
<Bronysith> season 3 in november
<AJIsAwesome> DAT POST
<Bronysith> yay
<AJIsAwesome> Not sure. I'll give it a few minutes.
<Zuxxez123> I'm sure it will have its appeal at first, but quickly become an annoying gimmick.
<Meanwhile> Wonder how long it'll take for that to be outed as a troll post.
<AJIsAwesome> ^ :D
<Barb|BODYMESSAGEMACH> Lies coming straight from EQD
<Applejack2012> trollers gonna troll
<AJIsAwesome> Someone screen cap it?

<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: All I recall is Taco hat guy.
<sonicandmario85> the fire gives you a warm feeling and its not real
*Wirisme wishes the hub was in this country

<AJIsAwesome> Bubbleception?
<LunasGuard> must pop bubbles
<RaveBrony> I wanna poke it with a stick :3

<MadSurge> AWW SHIT
<CK|Ded> The ice looks like it's actually burning, and the lava looks like it's rapid cooling
<Zuxxez123|Blackhole> That's what happens when you microwave Kraft cheese...

<DoctoDoctorWho> SirGanjalf: It is said that starting out as a scout, each and every space marine could be virtually invisable on the battlefield if they wanted to, they're just so OP they dont give a damn

<Zuxxez123> I keep hearing a skype comment, and keep checking my own Skype. xD
<SirGanjalf> DoctoDoctorWho: Of course they don't give a damn, otherwise the commander would wear a fucking helmet!

<Lunar_Brony> Caramel
<Lunar_Brony> I can tell from the pony in the corner
<DoctoDoctorWho> LunasGuard: yes, Im not entirely sure how its going to work, only that it will.
<Zuxxez123> Lol, okay.
<Bronysith> http://ziemniax.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-facing-Valus-330146160?q=gallery%3Aziemniax&qo=0
<Zuxxez123> I'll learn everyones streaming style in time. :3
<Lunar_Brony> shouldn't take too long
<LunasGuard> DoctoDoctorWho: (?_?)
<Zuxxez123> I'm getting used to a few of them. :D
<AdamTheDuck> You can tell it's Caramel by the pony at the bottom left Zuxxez123 :3
<LunasGuard> Bronysith: is that a stick?
<Zuxxez123> Alright, Caramel = pony buttom left corner. :3
<killerpony7733> Zuxxez123 I have been here or well full time or officially since around jan-feb 2012 and i've pretty much grown used to who is who. I never get mistaken for whos streaming
<DoctoDoctorWho> MOAR DAKKA!!!
<Zuxxez123> killerpony7733: I'm 3 days old to the stream. I've got a few of them figured I think, but I am sure I will screw up a name or two.
<killerpony7733> Zuxxez123 Ah so a newcomer but yeah been a regular since that date or so yep :)
<Lunar_Brony> Zuxxez123 only that pony, though. Wrek puts Twi and his OC up sometimes, Sumi has his OC and occasionally Luna, I've seen Shizu put up Roseluck, and Phase4 will put his OC up.
<Lunar_Brony> I've also seen Nitt put up his once
<DoctoDoctorWho> Zuxxez123: dont worry my little pony, soon you shall learn the ways of the internet. And that will make you strong.
<Zuxxez123> Er... What is OC?
<Lunar_Brony> original character
<AdamTheDuck> Zuxxez123, original character
<Zuxxez123> Oh... Obviously... /).-
<LunasGuard> DoctoDoctorWho: my little pony :D
<AdamTheDuck> Dat God
<DoctoDoctorWho> Zuxxez123: Origonal Character, what you would look like as a pony
<Lunar_Brony> inb4 OC spam
<killerpony7733> Zuxxez123 And to that note remember alicorns is a sign of bad creativity and all
<AdamTheDuck> ^ I thought an OC could be any new character, not just what one would look like as a pony.
<Lunar_Brony> yeah
<Lunar_Brony> but in the mlp fandom, we associate it with ponies usually
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Pretty much.
<killerpony7733> Zuxxez123: But don't try to overdo it it has to be modest and pretty truthful to what you'd expect form MLP FIM
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349132341357.jpg imma go take a cold shower now... (be warned)
<Zuxxez123> Alicorns = bad Juju. Got it.
<Nittany_Discord> I like to put my OC up when I stream.
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Nittany_Discord
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: My body is ready.
<AdamTheDuck> I'm not sure if I've ever seen a Nittany stream :<
<DoctoDoctorWho> Zuxxez123: only Lauren faust can have an alicorn OC and not have it be an overpowered mary sue.
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: Alicorns usually lead to dull characters man
<Lunar_Brony> I have a couple times
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> ^^
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord Yeah it's nice and for some it helps remember who is streaming
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: like "my alicorn is the most powerful thing more powerful than the princesses"
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Pff that and the instant royalty status
<Nittany_Discord> My streams aren't too special.
<thelonepony> hi Everypony :)
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: no shit
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Yuck, I hate those kinds of OCs.
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: I understand that, how can you have any faults if you are the creation of the three main lore based creations. Bah.
<Lunar_Brony> hi thelonepony
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai thelonepony
<Zuxxez123> Hiya there thelonepony how has your day been?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Nittany_Discord: Don't say that. I'm sure plenty of people like your streams. :)

Zuxxez123 this is how NOT to do an OC
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Homework nothing, read somethign wrong

<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: Right, no simple copy paste ponies, and no Alicorn crap. Got it.
<Lunar_Brony> Bronysith that last one wasn't even trying!
<Kimori> We would just have to wait
<Bronysith> and this is just bullshit " I apologize for there being no image of this OC, but the description, I hope, will suffice. This is an actual character pitch for a pony roleplay. "C0L7 [with a 0 and a 7] is an Omnicorn: a majestic creature with four wings and ram's horns. The Omnicorns are far greater, larger and more powerful than the alicorns. Omnicorns are the only things that can permanently kill alicorns. C0L7 has killed 644 al

<Amy> Did you guys see Saturday's episode of Doctor Who?
<Bronysith> Dovah: you take the cord
<Nittany_Discord> I hate these OC rules. I know there are good and bad characters, but making fun of people for having bad characters is wrong.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Amy: Nope. How is it?
<sub06905|TARDIS> wired or wireless xbox control?
<LunasGuard> needs to finsh OC
<Squallken> anyone read/hear the news?

<Dovah> Bronysith: I tryed that like 8376$7 times1
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Nittany_Discord: I can see that. I don't hate bad OCs, just wish they'd sprinkle a little creativity onto them.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I think he gets it guys, no alicorn OC's
<Amy> It was good.
<sub06905|TARDIS> Dovah: is it a wired or wireless control?
<Dovah> sub06905|TARDIS: wired

I made a joke a while back about being sent to the moon for wasting 15 seconds of Celestia's immortal life and changed to this nick. I dropped the RP quickly, but I kept the nick because I think it's awesome. I switch between this and my original every once in a while

<LunasGuard> thanks thelonepony
<Mozdoc> You getting put under for the whole wisdom teeth thing? Because being put under is amazing. Went through that years ago, and don't remember a thing but waking up at home with my sister spoon feeding me soup.
<Dovah> .
<Zuxxez123> Mozdoc: I'm getting local anesthic.
<Zuxxez123> Mozdoc: I'll be awake for it.
<Bronysith> that sucks
<cowvarkian> Mozdoc: sounds awesome
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: ask for general
<Bronysith> or get hit with a hammer
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: I'm going to see how much the insurance is going to take off of the bill, because getting put under is like 500 bucks more...
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: id say its worth it
<Bronysith> cause then it feels like it is over in 3 seconds
<Bronysith> instead of 3 hours of being drilled and cut open
<sub06905|TARDIS> wut
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: agreed
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: cause even with local there is going to still be mental trauma
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: Yeah.. Making the extra money worth while...
<Unnr> Oh blood magpies
<Zuxxez123> Yeah, they are leaving it open for me, if I want to get sedated or not.
<Unnr> why you such a bad chapter?
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: then get sedated
<Bronysith> they prick your arm
<Zuxxez123> The second the huge needle gets near my mouth, I'll probably cry out to get put out. Lol.
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: they insert an IV into your arm
<Bronysith> they inject some medicine
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: morphine?
<Bronysith> and in 30 seconds or less you're out like a light
<Bronysith> and then in 2 seconds you wake up and 3 hours passed
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: I've been through getting put under, I've had surgery done. It's not that I am worried about it, it's the cost. Lol.
<Kinixys> Good evening.
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: i say when it comes to pain
<Zuxxez123> Evening Kinixys
<Bronysith> just go through the extra bucks Zuxxez123
<thelonepony> Evening Kinixys
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: Right. Starting to make sense. Lol.
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: how old are you? i was 14 when i got my wisdom teeth out
<Zuxxez123> 18
<Zuxxez123> Got all four to get removed.
<Bronysith> yea
<Bronysith> get sedated beyond all belief
<Zuxxez123> xD
<Bronysith> you dont want to remember surgery
<Bronysith> my brotehr actually woke up during it
<Zuxxez123> The noise factor alone would be nightmare worthy, I'm sure...
<Zuxxez123> Now I'm really thinking about it, I don't want to remember any of this. xD Sedation it is!
<Bronysith> he woke up during surgery, they stopped, and gave him more anesthesia
<Bronysith> Zuxxez123: smart man
<Lunar_Brony> I was sedated because I needed mouth surgery. I remember falling asleep, then I woke up in a hospital bed with a couple "get well" cards on a nearby table. The good news was the drug worked. The bad news was instead of 3 hours, I was out for a month and a half.
<Kinixys> It's pretty cool how it's all over in mere seconds.
<Bronysith> Lunar_Brony: wait waht?
<cowvarkian> Lunar_Brony: lol wow
<Bronysith> Kinixys: it feels like a few seconds
<Kinixys> Lunar_Brony: Wha?
<Zuxxez123> Lunar_Brony: What?!
<Bronysith> Lunar_Brony: seriously?
<Mozdoc> Sounds like Lunar_Brony got some goooooood stuff.
<J_E_Smith71> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/400844_450760454963172_2032489959_n.jpg
<Mozdoc> Suddenly there's an ASSLOAD of war going on.
<cowvarkian> Mozdoc: suddenly?
<sub06905|TARDIS> J_E_Smith71: :O
<Lunar_Brony> Yeah. Legit. According to some neuro-somthing-ologist, I had a bad reaction to the drug that put me out for longer than intended
<Zuxxez123> Talking about mouth surgery and sedatement, all while a helluva war is going on. I like it.
<cowvarkian> Zuxxez123: which war?
<Lunar_Brony> no serious damage, but I was eating ALOT
<Kinixys> Lunar_Brony: That is bizzare. Was is pretty much a coma?
<Zuxxez123> Lunar_Brony: That must've been horribly scary for your parents...
<Zuxxez123> cowvarkian: the war on the stream.
<Zuxxez123> In-game war.
<cowvarkian> Zuxxez123: lolderp, the stream tisnt working for me
<Zuxxez123> Oh, okay. Lol.
<taoumi> anypony wana play borderlands 2 on pc for a bit?
<Lunar_Brony> Kinixys that's what I was told
<Bronysith> taoumi: im kind of mellow, sorry
<Moopy> Hang on a sec i think i need to refresh the stream on my screen here and pop the stream out
<Nittany_Discord> Damn. Laptop is struggling now.
<Lunar_Brony> Zuxxez123 they were scared sick.
<taoumi> Bronysith: i don't understand that remark
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Back with food.
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<Lunar_Brony> dammit I'm hungry now
<Bronysith> taoumi: i dont feel like it cause im not in the zone
<Bronysith> taoumi: just played a shit load of doom and am wiped
<taoumi> Bronysith: a~~~
<Moopy> there we go
<Zuxxez123> taoumi: if I had Boardlands 2 on PC, i'd play with you, but best I can do is 360 after a while...

<Nittany_Discord> I think it's heat-related.
<Zuxxez123> If only you had a shaman in this game, all those dead bodies to become skeletons, horrifying...
<Lunar_Brony> that could do it
<Bronysith> i have to say, thank god for general and local anethseia

<Lunar_Brony> I've heard about what that's like
<Lunar_Brony> one girl I know couldn't talk for a week after getting hers pulled
<Bronysith> Lunar_Brony: i was tripping balls
<Kinixys> I had mine cut out. All of them at once. It.. stung... for about 5-7 days.
<Lunar_Brony> I don't think I have to get mine pulled
<Bronysith> thank god for painkillers

<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome|Homework: I can notice stuff like that also. :3

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> cachi01: Yep. Either that or have muffin crumbs. :D
<cachi01> oh hey the good clone wars cartoons

<cachi01> BRB
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Too bad my stream's getting tons of buffers.
<AdamTheDuck> My stream is running fine
<Laurayne> Im Not A Fan Of Clone Wars
<twilight_sprinkle> i hope this isnt as bad as that new clone wars show
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Lucky you. :P
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> twilight_sprinkle: IT'S NOT.
<Caramel> 2,14 no, this one is actually good
<AdamTheDuck> How many Star Wars animations are there?
<Moopy> well you need to refresh Laurayne
<Caramel> 2,14 and the CG one should burn in hell
<SirGanjalf> ah, Clone Wars by Genndy Tartakovsky - why did they got rid of that animation style anyway?
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: ^^^
<Dark_Horst> it'S luke chinwalker!
<Dark_Horst> no wait
<Dark_Horst> wrong trilogy
<Zuxxez123> Lol.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> It's very good.
<Unnr> The jedi are a *bit* Overpowered in this one, you have to admit
<taoumi> i liked the samurai jack style
<taoumi> this one :3
<Lunar_Brony> I knew this looked familiar!
<Lunar_Brony> Samauri Jack!
<Dark_Horst> palpatine looks more like a gremlin here than yoda
<twilight_sprinkle> the CG clone wars reviving darth maul with magic and making him an anrdoid makes me feel like NC did about the bat card
<MirrorImage> Unnr - well the individual cartoons are all of about 5-10 minutes long
<Dken2021> yup. Genndy
<MirrorImage> they have to get a lot of things done quickly
<taoumi> gerneral gevus was a bad ass in this one
<thelonepony> he was
<CCCP> Goodbye Everyone
<twilight_sprinkle> bai CCCP !
<CCCP> night*
<thelonepony> night CCCP
<Dken2021> seeya CCCP
<taoumi> bye CCCP
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bye, CCCP :)
<Kinixys> Bye CCCP.
<Zuxxez123> Bye CCCP .
<Kinixys> All the pings for you CCCP!
<J_E_Smith71> Oh sweet 2D Clone Wars
<taoumi> dat face :/
<J_E_Smith71> We running the entire thing?
<taoumi> it's liek wat...45 min total
<taoumi> maybe
<AdamTheDuck> Only 45 minutes?
<taoumi> this one was really short
<Zuxxez123> All those pew pews...
<Dark_Horst> everything moves so fast!
<Dark_Horst> it's liek the writers were on caffeine
<Dark_Horst> adn the animators
<Dark_Horst> and everyone,r eally
<Caramel> 2,14 or they realized that future space warfare is boring when not done right
<taoumi> they wanted to tell the sotry. but only got 10 min maybe to do it
<Zuxxez123> So, this is actually good? I won't lie, I never really gave the shows a chance...
<Dark_Horst> pilot does not give a fuck
<Caramel> 2,14 yes, this is actually good
<Caramel> 2,14 it puts the CG one in its place
<taoumi> the cg one is meh
<Caramel> 2,14 the CG was absolute shit and should be condemned
<Unnr> Caramel: To be fair star wars´ space combat was always based on WWII style dogfights
<Zuxxez123> Lol. Alright, I'll be getting my popcorn ready then.
<Dark_Horst> why are they so short though? were the on a tight budget?
<Caramel> 2,14 this was back when cartoon network kicked ass
<taoumi> they ran them inbetwean shows
<Unnr> Dark_Horst: They were run as promos between regular cartoon network shows
<Caramel> 2,14 and instead of commercials, they showed this
<thelonepony> i miss Old Cartoon Network :(
<Dark_Horst> cool stuff
<AdamTheDuck> Wait, Cartoon Network shows commercials now?
<sonicdude558> Why hello everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello sonicdude558
<thelonepony> Hi sonicdude558
<Ryunosuke> Dark_Horst, so the princess can ask that exact same question later "aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?" :)
*Unnr wants to watch Hotel Transylvainia entierly because Genndy was the director
<Dark_Horst> that tank seems to have a horrible design flaw
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> on the other hand, if they showed this instead of commercials, when are you supposed to go to the bathroom?
<Zuxxez123> Dark_Horst: that's normal for EVERYTHING in this universe. Lol.
<sonicdude558> Yo what are we watching? Star Wars the Clone wars?
<Kandarihu> Ah, the Genndy Tartakovsky (sp?) Clone Wars
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> ^ :D
<Caramel> 2,14 twilight_sprinkle: it was only during a certain timeslot
<Caramel> 2,14 if I remember correctly, it was during toonami, but I could be horribly mistaken
<twilight_sprinkle> ah k
<taoumi> it was done on cartooncartoon fridays
<sonicdude558> 444
<Kandarihu> Caramel, I was an avid watcher of Toonami during most of it's time, but I never saw this.
<Caramel> 2,14 then taoumi must be right
<sonicdude558> also, nice dislogue
<Kandarihu> And since I just now came in at episode 4, I'm out of continuity.
<sonicdude558> *dialogue
<Caramel> 2,14 honestly, it was a loooooong time ago
<TheKoreanBrony1354> starwars

<twilight_sprinkle> in a galaxy far far away
<Dark_Horst> they're fucking up the whole planet
<twilight_sprinkle> darn it taoumi

<Ryunosuke> this is genius tactics here
<Ryunosuke> "They are kicking our ass, what do we do?!?!"
<sonicdude558> wheres the motorcycle
<J_E_Smith71> Caramel: I think they were shown during prime-time, but then Toonami ran them all at once afterwards
<sonicdude558> there we go

<ShadowQuill> ShadowQuill: Hey, me! How am I doing?

<sonicdude558> Row Row Fight the Powah! 8_6
<Ryunosuke> suddenly, on hoth.... again
<CK|Ded> I'm sorry, to anyone who likes the new Clone Wars....look at this and try to tell me that what we got is better. >.>
<sonicdude558> 6_9
<Dark_Horst> dejy vu
<Lyra`> ruuruu
<Dark_Horst> *deja
<AdamTheDuck> Hey Saturn, did you ever find out why plants are green?
<Dken2021> CK|Ded is the new one that bad?
<RoboGerbil> http://subjectnumber2394.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d55oeej
<Lyra`> ruruus
<twilight_sprinkle> dat radio music
<CK|Ded> Dken2021: It's very mediocre.
<superretroworld> we got to fight the power that beats
<twilight_sprinkle> velcam to 89.9 ef em, get redi for sam soozing tunes
<taoumi> zacora?
<Ryunosuke> "the heart of the cards!"
<Dken2021> Genndy sure loves his hartman hips
<CK|Ded> Dken2021: Its biggest problem is that you know perfectly well how it will end. So it tries to build drama that it can't maintain.
<Shamroc> wow SHE JUST noticed that..
<Dark_Horst> well, shit
<sonicdude558> ROBOTS
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, didnt know jedi could sense robots
<scout19_tf2> fail sneek attack
<CK|Ded> So instead of "oh no, will Anakin be killed?" it's more like "okay, so what bullshit excuse allows Anakin to survive this?"
<Ryunosuke> synchronized sabre dancing!
<Dken2021> CK|Ded ah, I see
<sonicdude558> good night guise
<scout19_tf2> dum droids
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: In theory, they can, they're just supposed not able to manipulate them like with humans.
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight sonicdude558
<thelonepony> night sonicdude558
<Dken2021> CK|Ded well, maybe it's for those who don't know star wars that well
<Lunar_Brony|TF2> g'night sonicdude558
<Ryunosuke> ABBALANCHE
<scout19_tf2> nite sonicdude558
<CK|Ded> Which is why the part in Ep 1 where Qui-Gon clearly uses a mind trick on a DROID is canonical bullshit
<Kinixys> Bye sonicdude558.
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: well no i think they actually can manipulate them too, obiwan opened electrical doors with the force
<scout19_tf2> yoda:O
<CrimsonPhoenix> THE SUN IS AN S
<Dken2021> silly, this speaking is
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Nope. The books make a very big deal out of droids not being manipulatives of a Jedi, at least not "mentally". Physically, sure, by shoving them around. But controlling their function, nope.
<J_E_Smith71> Whoa ugly close up
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: well in the book version of ep3 it was explained how they can screw with the circuitry
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Dken2021> hehehehehe
<Ryunosuke> uhhh
<twilight_sprinkle> oh crap
<Ryunosuke> WHAT
<twilight_sprinkle> shes azula!
<CK|Ded> Yoda. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> dont trust her!
<Shamroc> dat face
<Shamroc> yoda you smug bastard
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Which, again, is bullshit. It's supposed to be an incredible feat, one not actually attainable by a normal Jedi. >_>
<Ryunosuke> pouty face is op
<CK|Ded> But then, little stuff like this is why the prequel really screws the pooch. It messes up even the smallest touches of canon. :/
<Saturn> 08,01...
<CK|Ded> Yoda badass time?
<Saturn> 08,01star wars.
<CK|Ded> Yoda badass time.
*Saturn 08,01vacates
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: well idk, it seems like a pretty plausible ability if you have some knowledge in engineering. say you use the force to block electricity or trigger something in the programming, which shouldnt take much power, but more preciseness
<Ryunosuke> and the storm.... just stops?
<Ryunosuke> what?
*Shamroc cleans up Saturn's waste
*Bronysith chains Saturn
*Saturn 08,01sprockets Bronysith
<Shamroc> damnit Saturn cant start craping everywhere you wanna know
<Bronysith> Saturn: what the bloody hell is sprockets?
<scout19_tf2> badass yoda
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: jfgi
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: How do you use the Force, a physical manipulative tool, to alter programming, a digital and decidedly non-physical entity?
<Bronysith> Saturn: how many paupu leaves have you sniffed?
<Dovah> Breaking News! Dovah did his homework!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: programming is physical on the binary level, its a chemical principle of yes-no
<twilight_sprinkle> well not always chemical i think
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Dovah: Nice. I still have to do mine. :D
<Ryunosuke> STOP SAYING THAT
<scout19_tf2> dat phrase
*twilight_sprinkle has a bad feeling about stuff
<CK|Ded> That would require that a Jedi's power being able to manipulate binary switches in a microprocessor.
<CK|Ded> Which they can't. >_>
<taoumi> why hello there twilight amadala
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: not necessarily manipulate, just screw with the flow and maybe damage the processors, which doesnt take much strength
<Ryunosuke> sand people... oh hoth?
<Caramel> 2,14 really guys? technical arguments about star wars? Why can't you just have a little bit of suspension of disbelief and enjoy the god damn lasers?
<CK|Ded> Er no, they would have to be able to physically adjust the switches. :P
<Dark_Horst> i think it's more a matter of resolution than strength
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: because its a fun discussion
<Dken2021> because people are fickle
<CK|Ded> Damaging the processors wouldn't mentally manipulate the droids.
<Ryunosuke> ....
<scout19_tf2> bait
<Kinixys> Star wars is pretty much about lasers now.
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: well manipulating their decisions might be pretty op
<Dark_Horst> also, they would have to be able to fluidly think in binary to be able to actually do anything effective to the droid
<Shizuka> 13Caramel: silly val say it right
<Shizuka> 13BRONYSTATE
<Shizuka> 13LESS QQ
<Shizuka> 13MORE PEW PEW
<CK|Ded> Caramel: I'm enjoying :P
<Ryunosuke> lol Shizuka
<Caramel> 2,14 Shizu: rofl, well said
<twilight_sprinkle> star wars isnt all about lasers, you know
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: <3
<Dark_Horst> they'd also need to know the froids exact program
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, you're right Shizuka XD
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway i think i hear my laundry calling, brb
<scout19_tf2> no need to fear the jedi are here
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, which is why I said that the books made such a huge deal out of how extremely difficult it is for a Jedi to manipulate the mental functions of a droid.
<Kinixys> It all comes back to lasers, in the end.
<Dark_Horst> there were only 2 edi in that thing?
<CK|Ded> DOO-KU
<Dark_Horst> who the hell cleans the toilets?
<taoumi> KAAAAAAAAAN
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: And that's also why I actually have issues with Qui-Gon manipulating the droid's thought process early in the movie. 'cuz he actually shouldn't be able to. XD
<CK|Ded> Damage it, yeah, or throw it around. Mind trick it? Er, no.
<scout19_tf2> hut hut hut
<CK|Ded> ....dat stereotypical "hut" sound

<scout19_tf2> ded ded and ded
<Saturn> 08,01so, um
<Ryunosuke> ow
<Saturn> 08,01the kernel had a compile error
<J_E_Smith71> Uh, invincible thing?
<Ryunosuke> DUH
<Dark_Horst> silly, clone trooper, you're not supposed to hump the tree
<scout19_tf2> no der anikan
<Dark_Horst> that's just silly
<Dken2021> aww that sucks Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01you'd think that people with upstream access woudl know that you don't commit non-working changes
<CK|Ded> ded
<Dovah> its tyler durden (or whateve his name was)
<thelonepony> nameless trooper NOOOOOO!
<Caramel> 2,14 surprise surprise, Anakin led a bunch of people to their deaths
<CK|Ded> Zecora!
<Dark_Horst> R4! NOOOOOOOO!
<scout19_tf2> r4 U WILL BE AVENGED:'(
<J_E_Smith71> NOOOOOO random R4 unit
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, you can commit them, but you don't push them
<Caramel> 2,14 also, lol at the droid getting more of an emotional response than the troopers :P
<scout19_tf2> :D
<Dken2021> the lightsabers are red, you know she's a sith
<Lunar_Brony> what the . . . creepy metal lady
<thelonepony> :D
<CK|Ded> Oh, right, this.
<Dark_Horst> so that'S what jack did before she landed in the space prison'S fridge
<CK|Ded> This is pretty sweet too.
<J_E_Smith71> Caramel: Actually I was following up on the NOOOOO Trooper line
<CK|Ded> But then, everything in this series runs on Rule of Cool.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I didn't know Star Wars had an animated series.
<Caramel> 2,14 I meant from Anakin
<CK|Ded> *Everything*. No exceptions.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I knew they had Clone Wars.
<Caramel> 2,14 was more a comment on his priorities :P
<J_E_Smith71> Oh whoops
<Derpy_Hooves> i can't get over how FUCKING RETARDED anakin looks
<Derpy_Hooves> awesome mini movie, but fuck
<CK|Ded> The art is stylized.
<ASoftFluffyThing> This looks like Star Wars in Samurai Jack style
<Derpy_Hooves> it's like looking at a broken mirrir
<Derpy_Hooves> mirror
<J_E_Smith71> ASoftFluffyThing: Same team
<Caramel> 2,14 ASoftFluffyThing: made byt he same people
<Adjeca> kimori did i show you the spyro lighter i got?
<taoumi> no fly. jump good
<ASoftFluffyThing> J_E_Smith71, Caramel Aaah I knew that style was famliar
<scout19_tf2> ahhhhh sameri jack good timez goooooood timez
<Kencolt> ASoftFluffyThing: Well, it WAS directed and produced by Genndy Tartakovsky, who did Samurai Jack.
<Dark_Horst> he adapted to her fighting style awfully quick
<Caramel> 2,14 one of these days I'll stream Jedi Outcast and Academy
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kencolt: That explains it then. Because I was going to be a smartass and say "When did Samurai Jack become a Jedi?"
<scout19_tf2> somepony shud stream sameri jack
<scout19_tf2> shit just got real
<J_E_Smith71> scout19_tf2: Well Wrek did a couple months ago
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lightsaber fight in the rain. Who's gonna get electrocuted first?
<scout19_tf2> i wasnt here a couple monthes ago
<Caramel> 2,14 as Luna did a couple months before that
<Kencolt> Lightsabers are not electric.
<Dark_Horst> there is never enough samurai jack
<Caramel> 2,14 she has the high ground anakin!
<Dark_Horst> yeah, but he's got augmentation boni
<scout19_tf2> got dat right Dark_Horst
<Kencolt> The high ground is only an advantage if you know how to use it. Apparently, she doesn't.
<scout19_tf2> oh shit

<Kencolt> Holy Smokes. It's a Worgen Jedi.
<CK|Ded> Once more, without a WORD of spoken dialogue (except a scream), this series conveys Anakin's slow fall to the Dark Side better than the prequels EVER did

<magmablock> Obama's estranged brother
<scout19_tf2> :O
<Lunar_Brony> is it dead?
<CK|Ded> And this series shows you precisely WHY his Ep 3 debut is such a fucking disappointment. XD
<Lunar_Brony> ^
<Lunar_Brony> agreed
<Kencolt> The seciong Clone Wars animated (not the CGI thing) has an explanation for Greivious' poor health...
<scout19_tf2> dat depression
<CK|Ded> Take count of the number of Jedi
<abrony> jqwedia
*Reikim whistles
*Reikim listens for the echo
<scout19_tf2> dat voice sucks
<CK|Ded> Kencolt: But it's excuse making, not a good reason
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: is it just cause he wasnt an entirely succesful creation?
<abrony> dat noise
<Kencolt> CK|Ded: I think it's a very good reason.

<scout19_tf2> yodas face:D
<CK|Ded> Kencolt: So to explain that a bit more clearly, basically what happened is: Ep 3 comes out, Grevious is a pussy, and when people point this out, Lucas pretends to be all mysterious about it like "you'll see lol" when in actuality they basically dropped the ball on it and there really wasn't a plan. They just realized that they had no way to kill Grevious in his present form, so they hampered him severely in Ep 3 and developed the expla

<Ryunosuke> whats that
<Thrackerzod> lol
<Ryunosuke> FIRE
<CK|Ded> Another thing I like about this series: Clone troopers aren't just pointless characters, they DO SHIT.
<Lunar_Brony> I love how they just stare at it
<abrony> lol dem tectures
<Eddmario> Lunar_Brony: So you live in Texas?
<Dark_Horst> CK|Ded: the ones doing shit are an elite commando
<CK|Ded> Watch this, seriously. THEY DO SHIT.
<Ryunosuke> that gun
<Adjeca> ok one moment
<Ryunosuke> needs more barrels
<abrony> lol dat big gun
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo? o.o
<CK|Ded> This is how the troopers should always have been.
<Lunar_Brony> Eddmario no, Canada
<thelonepony> Moo :3
<AdamTheDuck> NewSuperBronyU, moo
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey, it's a NewSuperBronyU
<Zuxxez123> NewSuperBronyU: heard people talking about him. :P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<Kinixys> Are they like the super elite?
<magmablock> You know, they really should render the CG at the same framerate as the animation so it doesn't stick out so much
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: they did stuff in ep3 too, it just wasnt the focus of the movie, whereas these are more action shorts
<AdamTheDuck> NewSuperBronyU, you missed out on epic mooage
<Lunar_Brony> yes NewSuperBronyU, but you missed it :(
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02D:
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02;~;
<Shamroc> Kinixys: if they got collored armor..then yes
<Eddmario> Ah, so you live in Northern Wisconsin then...
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: What did the troopers do in Ep 3?
<Lunar_Brony> AdamTheDuck LoLz, mooage

<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Besides die that is. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: they were winning the war.
<abrony> tf2 in a nutshell
<scout19_tf2> overkill
<Lunar_Brony> abrony IKR?
<Thrackerzod> Xcom accuracy right here
<ScootaExcel> 00,03Guys... Excel is HARD O_O
<Zuxxez123> Thrackerzod: xD So true.
<J_E_Smith71> CK|Ded: Killed bunch of Jedi
<AdamTheDuck> There's no kill quite like overkill
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: just because it wasnt constantly shown, it doesnt mean they werent doing anything
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: You're misunderstanding.
<Thrackerzod> hai
<Lunar_Brony> hi ScootaExcel. The program, right?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohey Scoot-Scootaloo *hugs*
<Adjeca> this was given out at a club in Hollywood to promote the game before it was released. and to game journalists as i just learned
<abrony> hia :3
<twilight_sprinkle> ScootaExcel: whats so hard about it?O.o
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Yeah that. It's a jerk :|
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03and evenin', newfriends!
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: In the movies, they're delegated to secondary characters with no major roles and no crowning moments of badass.
<Lunar_Brony> Tell me about it :/
<Dark_Horst> CK|Ded: played republic commando?
<Shamroc> told ya...PLOT ARMOR
<Thrackerzod> they need ded
<Shamroc> ded
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: In this series, you get to see the value of the clone troopers and how they contributed to the war effort with their own awesome moments. Even the new Clone Wars series does a better job of this than Ep 3 did.
<scout19_tf2> BLOW EM UP
<Thrackerzod> lol
<Lunar_Brony> kaboom
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Scoot-Scootaloo: You missed some MLG Star Wars.
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: because its not what the movie is about. there were series like this for that, if youll notice, this series has practically no plot, where as the movie was more focused on story
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I know :'(
<Lunar_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo and epic mooage
<Lunar_Brony> but you wouldn't give a sh*t . . .

<scout19_tf2> hmmm
<CK|Ded> Six Jedi, bro
<Cades> oh cool
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<CK|Ded> The padawan still counts
<Shamroc> Eddmario...yeah obi-wan was "the chosen one" at one point...but he proved false
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Plushie Compilation #86
<abrony> lol his face
<abrony> wtf
<Ryunosuke> AKU
<Dken2021> Scoot-Scootaloo hey, that could be your kid
<twilight_sprinkle> what is that
<CK|Ded> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
<ASoftFluffyThing> Scoot-Scootaloo, oh that's little Anakin
<Thrackerzod> hes a tree
<Dark_Horst> what the fuzz
<Eddmario> Did I hear TWO of the people from the Boast Busters script reading at Canterlot Gardens in this scene?
<Zuxxez123> Was that tree beard?
<Ryunosuke> fluttertree is a jedi?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Dken2021: :O
<Dken2021> Eddmario mmhmm, and it was smexy
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: But that's part of the problem.
<abrony> grumble
<abrony> lol
<flutterchu> it looks more like the DISCORDED fluttershy sleeping (whatever)
<Eddmario> Scoot-Scootaloo: HOW THE FUCK WAS THAT SPOILERS?!?!?!?
<CK|Ded> Oh go stuff it, Treebeard, it's going to happen anyways
<Yahooz> SPOILED IT
<StinkomanFan> THE GOOD STAR WARS CARTOON
<Yahooz> and shit
<StinkomanFan> THANK YOU
<twilight_sprinkle> oh god that expression
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Eddmario: Because I didn't see it yet :P
<Dken2021> yo StinkomanFan
<Squallken> lol those faces
<StinkomanFan> every expression from Yoda in this Cartoon is gold
<abrony> dem.......things
<Squallken> and out comes samurai jack
<RoboGerbil> looks like a scene out of the MIB cartoon
<StinkomanFan> See all those BG charactors? They ALL have backstories and names
<Eddmario> Scoot-Scootaloo: It's not spoilers if the VAs are mentioned AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO!
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: The issue is that the clones had no characterization. They were mindless bodies just like the droids, which is an epic fail because it neglects to focus on WHY they were winning the war. A big part of why they were winning is because the clones were human. Human thought and emotion.
<StinkomanFan> Because Lucasarts
<abrony> :|
<Mega_Milk> wow -lol
<scout19_tf2> boooooo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Still counts as spoilers...
<Thrackerzod> then the y had sex
<Dken2021> O_O
<Dken2021> Padme?
<abrony> that was quick
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Also this series has more story, and a better story, than Ep 3. >_>
<Kinixys> Cinnabons...
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: The new Clone Wars series is better at it too.
<Dken2021> and then comes the angst
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: star wars was never about just fighting, there are other shows for that, so there is n need for heroic trooper moments in the movie. it was explained why theyre winning the war, because they had more thought variety. and no, this series has practically no story, its just war. ep3 had plenty of story
<Eddmario> Wait, is that Tara Strong?
<CK|Ded> Padme, your eyes are kind of large
<RoboGerbil> jedis have wedding ceremonies tho
<abrony> her voice is fimiliar

<Buytoast> the most deadly kindm of death
<scout19_tf2> its a rape
<Eddmario> Why does Yoda ALWAYS look pissed in this?
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Barbetos> Punch in face padawan I will
<IcY_> then he twitched and mutilated anakin
<Ryunosuke> thats not exactly SAFE
<Dark_Horst> and then he burned his ear off
<magmablock> Because he's the Yode
<RoboGerbil> anikan is just trying to get his numbers up on his char sheet
<abrony> OW GAWD MAH SHOULDERS
<Lunar_Brony> IcY_ my thoughts exactly
<twilight_sprinkle> well that seems kinda over-the-top for modest jedi
<Barbetos> Complete douche you are Anakin.

<Derpy_Hooves> oh
<Reikim> Seriously Yahooz why
<CK|Ded> Two. XD
<Derpy_Hooves> how long is it? o 3o
<Lunar_Brony> 2 jedi

<Eddmario> I take it on the DVD they're edited together as a single movie, leaving out the credits and tite for each episode
<Dark_Horst> POSE!
<Eddmario> *title
<Dark_Horst> wow
<Reikim> You're not on Skype, I can't bitch at you there.
<taoumi> finaly
<Dark_Horst> his hair grew fast
<Lyra`> NewSuperBronyU, i ping you because i wub you :3
<taoumi> i got the head right
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: i say it had way more development than here. anaking argued with obiwan in ep 2, its nothing new. as for him becoming jedi, thats not really an important scene. so far nothing important has really happened
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lyra`: o////o
<Derpy_Hooves> Caramel: at least they didn't make anikin look really retarded in this one... he still look retarded though :I
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah this was in chapters when it first aired on TV
<abrony> pew pew pew pew pew
*Lunar_Brony glomps Lyra`
<Lyra`> ^-^
<Lyra`> RAWR!
<Reikim> Actually.
<Reikim> ACTUALLY
<Kencolt> Eddmario: I have the DVD. You can watch it as a single movie-- or watch the eps separately, withy breaks intact.
<nerf_soldier> i remember this on. it was on cartoon network, right?
<Reikim> You probably have the right idea.
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<Lyra`> wolfman jedi?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so Yahooz did i get kicked of the gruop already ?
<Lunar_Brony> eeyup
<Dark_Horst> rawr
<Eddmario> Hm, can Anakin use the force with his robot arm? It's never mentioned AT ALL through all 6 movies if he can or not
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: The arguments in this series help establish actual development. The arguments in Ep 2 tend to be over trivial and stupid shit that doesn't develop the characters. >_>
<Yahooz> your still in it
<Lyra`> she digs scars
<Lyra`> and fake arms
<abrony> lol
<Eddmario> I don't remember him having that scar in episode 3 at all...
<Dken2021> a scar, he's truely evil then
<abrony> lol
<Ryunosuke> Obiwan, sleeping in the gutters
<Cades> That's awesome
<scout19_tf2> DAT BAD NEWS
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> thought i would get kicked to make room for someone active
<abrony> lol
<Kencolt> Eddmario: Well, since she's got no problem slinging the force as Vader...
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: the argument here was kinda the same. anakin being brash, obiwan trying to teach him patience and control. its happened both in ep2 and 3
<Thrackerzod> XD
<Caramel> 2,14 So a bit of insight to this particular movie: they were basically forced to address the *many* issues episode 3 provided
<Dark_Horst> he'S like "fuck this shit"
<abrony> yum
<Ryunosuke> that lunch
<Squallken> how long are these episodes?
<Yahooz> lol as of now we dont need to do that
<Thrackerzod> yummy
<thelonepony> Best lunch ever
<Reikim> There's an upper limit?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> :D
<Ryunosuke> LOL
<Mega_Milk> Meal worms and grubs =D
<Caramel> 2,14 such as why greivus sucks ass, how Obi Wan knows Cody, yada yada
<scout19_tf2> numnumnum
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Also, nothing important has happened? The only way you can say that is by not paying attention. XD This series has already explained Anakin's ascension, helped further illustrate his fall to the dark side, the intro of Grevious, etc
<Ryunosuke> ....
<Reikim> Anyway yeah you're still there.
<Yahooz> to calls supposively
<abrony> yummy worm
<Yahooz> 24 max
<Thrackerzod> eww
<scout19_tf2> grubs
<Ryunosuke> that works?
<CK|Ded> Sounds legit
<Ryunosuke> I hadnt thought of that
<Kimori> yeah you showed me
<Yahooz> however, ive seen the Luna group make a call with 40+...
<Dken2021> what a plan
<Dark_Horst> "just great"
<Ryunosuke> .....
<taoumi> beat me too it CK|Ded
<twilight_sprinkle> dat quote
<CK|Ded> ....DAT TRIBUTE LINE
<Yahooz> my skype crashed shortly afterward, so its still a myth
<abrony> yummy food and yummy smells in a yummy place
<CK|Ded> Did you catch that?
<CK|Ded> "What an incredible smell you've discovered." <---- Han's line to Chewie in Ep 4
<Lunar_Brony> nice
<CK|Ded> That was subtle, and awesome.
<Ryunosuke> ....
<Ryunosuke> THAT line
<Kimori> Its probably one of the rariest items in your collection
<Eddmario> Gumballs?
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: none of that is important, none of it influences the story. its all been done in ep3. and there doesnt have to be a 30 minute intro battle to show theres this dude grievous whos dangerous
<Lunar_Brony> >alternatives to fighting
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> luna group ?
<Lunar_Brony> >mind=blown
<Yahooz> Save Luna
<Ryunosuke> those...
<Ryunosuke> wookiees?
<scout19_tf2> oh no
<twilight_sprinkle> noob
<Squallken> wookies
<taoumi> you lost me at insted of punching things
<abrony> :O oh noze
<scout19_tf2> SHIT RUUUUUUN
<Dken2021> d'aww, they're so cute <3
<Derpy_Hooves> OH MY GOD, what have they done to the wookies?!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> haven't started skype in quite a while
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soo no idea
<Eddmario> Yeah, NOBODY can draw wookies right...
<Dark_Horst> they look more like monkeys than ever
<scout19_tf2> cis gona win dis time
<abrony> there mowing our lawn :[
<Reikim> Leaving chat!
*Reikim ninjas out
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: No, none of that was addressed in Ep 3. Grevious just shows up without explanation, Anakin is suddenly a Knight, and the fact that he's Palpatine's bitch is unexplained. Seriously, did you watch both of those movies? O.o
<Lunar_Brony> "This is Chewbacca. This does not make sense!:
<Lunar_Brony> *"
<CK|Ded> The skip between 2 and 3 explains NONE of that stuff.
<abrony> dawww
<Derpy_Hooves> dem blue elephanrs :V
<J_E_Smith71> Sad Max Rebo
<flutterchu> i thoguht friday was movie night
<Lunar_Brony> it is
<Lunar_Brony> Saturdy is Euro Movie Night
<J_E_Smith71> flutterchu: It is. This is just a random suprise thing
<Eddmario> I SWEAR the VA for Dooku sounds familiar in this...
<flutterchu> so what "episode" are we watching
<J_E_Smith71> Eddmario: Corey Burton
<J_E_Smith71> flutterchu: The 2003 Clone Wars cartoon
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: it doesnt Have to be explained, since when are movies required to make 30 minute intros for every character? movies always have to make a choice of what to make more detailed, and what not. there is no need to make any intro to characters like grievous, because he is a robot, he was created, not raised with an incredible personal story
<Lunar_Brony> the GOOD one
<flutterchu> oh okay
<Eddmario> YEN SID! THAT'S where I heard his voice before...
<nerf_soldier> why doesn't grievous ever use the force?
<Eddmario> What the FUCk is up with Palpatine's sleeves?
<Ryunosuke> anakin
<Caramel> 2,14 Grievous isn't a jedi
<scout19_tf2> pimp sleeves
<Caramel> 2,14 he has no control over the force
<flutterchu> since it's FINALLY OCTOBER happy nightmare night
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: They don't need to give 30 minute intros, but they DO have to explain new characters. There is no reason for them not to. That is poor storytelling, throwing in new characters without explanation.
<Eddmario> nerf_soldier: He's not actually a Jedi/Sith. He's just tained in using Lightsabers
<abrony> Eddmario epic sleevs of win
<twilight_sprinkle> i think grievous has some feel for the force though
<taoumi> gevus is just a badass
<Lunar_Brony> but he can swing a light saber
<Caramel> 2,14 nah, he's just a robot with lightsabers
<Lunar_Brony> yeah
<Caramel> 2,14 and as you'll see soon (spoiler warning) his lack of force powers is his undoing
<CK|Ded> Well....
<RoboGerbil> hes not a robot, hes an android
<Eddmario> Caramel: Cyborg technically
<Dark_Horst> Caramel: cyborg
<RoboGerbil> he ahs a living brain
<Kinixys> Thought it was a cyborg.
<Caramel> 2,14 whatevs
<abrony> grivous is human body parts in a robot
<CK|Ded> Technically he's a cyborg, yeah
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, i think i read somewhere taht he did have a slight onnection to the force
<CK|Ded> Which is why he dies the way he does in Ep 3
<Caramel> 2,14 point is, he can't do jedi shit
<CK|Ded> He's more machine now, than man.
<CK|Ded> Twisted and evil.
<Mega_Milk> -lol
<Spitfire> yes sir
<Spitfire> \yes sir
<abrony> lol
<Lunar_Brony> Squirrel!
<Kinixys> How is he able to anticipate the Jedi movements without connection to the force?
<Spitfire> right away sir
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: I just looiked up the General a bit ago on Wokiepedia. He's got no actual force sense or connection-- and resents the fact to the extent he wants to kill all jedi.
<RoboGerbil> its all lethal
<Spitfire> sir
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: the reason for them not to, is because its a movie, it has to be done in 2 hours or so, they cant spend that time displaying backstories for every character like cody, grievous, etc. they arent even real people, they were made, they have no wortwhile backstory to be displayed
<Zuxxez123> Snarf?
<abrony> shoot it all
<Caramel> 2,14 the same way duelists can anticipate swordplay?
<Ryunosuke> STOP SAYING THAT
<Caramel> 2,14 it's called technique
<twilight_sprinkle> hm well ok Kencolt
<Mega_Milk> oh shi--
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Grevious is a major character in the story. >_>
<abrony> er mahgerd
<Spitfire> is it dangerous sir?
<Spitfire> can i shoot it sir?
<abrony> yus
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: You can't introduce a major character without explanation, or you SUCK at storytelling.
<Lunar_Brony> Kinixys watch bidy language, fast reflexes, skill at swining a sword of pure energy
<Lunar_Brony> *body
<magmablock> In my opinion, it's best to drop hints to a character's backstory as you go, rather than explaining it all at once as soon as they arrive
<abrony> rahhhhhhhhh
<abrony> wut
<Ryunosuke> uh
<Caramel> 2,14 hey look! it's Avatar now
<Spitfire> NAVI
<Lunar_Brony> IKR?
<Mega_Milk> ehhhh.......
<Ryunosuke> what he said?
<Lunar_Brony> "I'm pissed off!"
<abrony> dem native navies
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> more like smurf mixed with avatar Caramel
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: And actually there's a LOT of backstory to Grevious. The problem is, none of it comes up in the movies at all. He literally shows up.
<RoboGerbil> kill all the natives
<CK|Ded> No shit, Windu
<Thrackerzod> oh nose
<Spitfire> *DRAMITIC HAND MOTIONS*
<abrony> dem dance moves
<Lunar_Brony> no shit Yoda
<J_E_Smith71> Hey they do like the things from Avatar
<CK|Ded> Oh, right, and this is explaining why Ep 3 opens with a massive assault
<J_E_Smith71> Cameron must have stole them for this
<Lunar_Brony> eeyup
<thelonepony> Mombasa All over
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: hes just an advanced robot, like a miniboss, he doesnt have to have a backstory. if he does, then so does cody, and half the other characters in sw, which would take 3 more movies. grievous backstory was implied as such: hes a robot, an experimental model created for the soul purpose of killing and leading droids, there is nothing tmore to his character, hence no need for an big intro
<CK|Ded> Because Ep 3 botched basically everything in the story department. >_>
<Derpy_Hooves> go away lucifur
<Kinixys> If that's the case there should be far more 'Grievous'es.
<J_E_Smith71> It's Jedi Satan
<nerf_soldier> wouldn't it be that avatar looks like those creatures since this came out first?
<Ryunosuke> cat women arent happy
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: He's a cyborg, number one. :P Number two, he's the second major villain in Ep 3. That merits some explanation, period.
<Caramel> 2,14 >implying Cameron didn't steal a shitload of ideas for Avatar
<Applechip> why is this scene so slow when the previous scene was a huge battle set up?
<Adjeca> ahh yeah
<magmablock> Avatar is basically Pocahontis i space
<Dark_Horst> avatar is basically pocahintas in space
<Dken2021> FACE!
<Ryunosuke> then anakin became a furry
<abrony> dat high guy
<ASoftFluffyThing> uuugh
<Thrackerzod> dude im so high
<CK|Ded> Destard?
<CK|Ded> Like how to read subtitles?
<Mega_Milk> that chief is crazy relaxed.
<Alister> crazy high actually
<abrony> i think he's dead
<ASoftFluffyThing> He ooks DEAD
<CK|Ded> I think their chief is really high.
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: hes just a super-robot, there is no explanation to him besides "he was made in a lab for killing stuff", which is obvious enough from the movie. people often fail to notice subtle hints to backstories in ep3
<ASoftFluffyThing> looks*
<abrony> wut fighya
<Derpy_Hooves> Caramel: http://i-never-knew-that.tumblr.com/image/32361038093
<Eddmario> EPISODE 3 ENDING FORSHADOWING!
<Lunar_Brony> I don't care what he's on, I want some of that, man!
<scout19_tf2> oh noooooooooooo
<Mega_Milk> -lol dat panic.
<abrony> oaaahhh noaah
<Caramel> 2,14 he claims
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: No, he's a cyborg. Now I again must question if you've paid attention. He clearly has human parts in Ep 3, which is why he dies. >_>
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<Caramel> 2,14 when in reality all he wanted was a trippier version of Furngully
<CrimsonPhoenix> Derpy_Hooves, and Pocahontas is older
<Dark_Horst> furngully?
<Caramel> 2,14 an old animated movie
<J_E_Smith71> Fern Gully
<Lunar_Brony> yes, Ferngully
<Caramel> 2,14 was pretty good
<Lunar_Brony> whatev
<princess> hai everypony
<abrony> awww dayum
<Lunar_Brony> hi princess
<prince-dari> I hate James Cameron for Titanic
<Applechip> Windu can fly
<abrony> princess hia dere
<thelonepony> Hi princess :3
<taoumi> lol wat
<abrony> its like a horse
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi dari
<Dken2021> More Badass Windu
<CK|Ded> ....forgot about that one
<Applechip> because that's how programming works right?
<prince-dari> Hey
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> hi, princess
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: thats not imporant...his character was limited to that of a killing machine, his bioparts were just an attempt to give him a connection to the force so he could hunt down jedi
<Lunar_Brony> prince-dari Titanic was too slow for my tastes. Also, hi
<Kinixys> Windu usese force to hax.
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Homework dat tab fail
<Dark_Horst> droid jet rodeo
<CK|Ded> I don't think that actually works. XD
<princess> hai :3 this seems good
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Homework . . . or not
<princess> ima be on chatz n on rp so brb
<abrony> WE GOT 4 ON OUR TAIL :o take them out :|
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Lunar_Brony: :P
<DocSane> Oh, is this the original Clone Wars series?
<thelonepony> Windu is a badass
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane eeyup, the good one
<RoboGerbil> needs more screen clutter
<Thrackerzod> This would be fun in Battelfront eh?
<Ryunosuke> NEED DICTORS, BUBBLES ARE FREE
<Lunar_Brony> Thrackerzod it IS
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Actually his character was non-existant in Ep 3. He's a generic villain with very little characterization and he comes out of nowhere, again, which is a flaw in the story of that movie. I like that movie, too, and even I admit that it's a HUGE flaw.
<Ryunosuke> TACKLE EVERYTHING!
<abrony> he deserves sun glasses
<DocSane> You know what this needs? Samurai Jack.
<Applechip> URA
<Shizuka> 13ded
<Dken2021> DocSane you mean it's not samurai jack enough?
<SirGanjalf> Not sure if someone already posted it(probably did), but still: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CtZqyZ-WywE/UGnZVc3v8mI/AAAAAAAAAY0/zBppYyfVm6s/s400/Screen-shot-2012-10-01-at-12.40.02-PM.png
<abrony> raaaahhh
<Eddmario> DocSane: I think it might be the same animators who worked on this
<Dark_Horst> yeah... right
<scout19_tf2> attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
<DocSane> Eddmario: Hence my suggestion.
<Dken2021> SirGanjalf yup, it happened, expect relief and anticipation
<Lunar_Brony> dat swarm
<Ryunosuke> GET REPS ON THE CAPS!
<Eddmario> SirGanjalf: Eyup, I mentioned that about 10-20 minutes ago right when I got here
<SirGanjalf> so many clones:O
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: And if his role were minor, that'd be fine. But it's not. He is the guy who takes over after Dooku is cut out of the script, making him the second major villain and the most visible of the bunch. You can't just have him show up and say nothing about him.
<Eddmario> This looks very similar to the art style of Milton J. Pool.
<SirGanjalf> oh well...
<Applechip> someone get that guy some aspirin
<abrony> she is so FUCKING old
<Wirisme> Why am I still awake?
<Wirisme> btw what's this?
<Ryunosuke> Dreads needed to go into siege mode, and Carriers in Traige
<princess> back
<Lunar_Brony> Wirisme because Bronystate is awesome
<Wirisme> :)
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: his character was pretty much that of a robot, he doesnt have to be a dostoevsky character to be a mostly-robot villain. he was created for killing, so he has no character.he may have been a major character in terms of holding the jedi slightly back, but plot-wise, he changed Nothing for the story, so eh wasnt really a major character for the story
<abrony> lol troll
<J_E_Smith71> Wirisme: Star Wars Clone Wars
<princess> THATS A SHE?
<Wirisme> I see
<Mega_Milk> Yoda is so OP -lol
<Lunar_Brony> IKR?
<SirGanjalf> Obi troll
<Wirisme> "What's this" *yoda appears*
<Applechip> Why does it keep switching between two unrelated scenes?
<abrony> no go back inside
<twilight_sprinkle> their expressions are almsot as good as 60s spidey
<abrony> youre grounded
<Buytoast> goddamn kermit\
<abrony> dem dance moves
<J_E_Smith71> Applechip: Showing what's going on with Anakin and Obi-Wan on that planet and what's happening with this battle
<Lunar_Brony> Yoda is OP. Requires nerf.\
<abrony> lol
<Wirisme> leeches!
<twilight_sprinkle> blue poop
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: I can't agree with that since he's effectively the leader of the Separatists given that the true leader never shows his face. >_>
<SirGanjalf> tattoo leeches
<J_E_Smith71> That armpit hair
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: the true leader is dooku, not grievous, and hes shown his face. the true true villain is secret
<princess> back
<CK|Ded> Dooku dies at the start of the film, twilight_sprinkle.
<Dark_Horst> boss clone
<SirGanjalf> sucking out your blood and pumping ink instead...
<CK|Ded> Grevious is stated to take over after them.
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: and?
<superretroworld> looks like an avatar
<Mega_Milk> -lol Horsey just messed that robut up :3
<Dark_Horst> kung force
<SirGanjalf> Holy shit
<Ryunosuke> again with the punching of the robots
<princess> XD
<Squallken> lol
<SirGanjalf> And i thought Yoda was OP
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: yeah and they lost pretty fast after that. hes an assassin, not a war leader
<Dken2021> Ryunosuke becuase it's coolz!
<Ryunosuke> ....
<superretroworld> everyones watching star wars while im watching seinfeld
<abrony> ;O I SAW BLOOD
<Squallken> BOOM
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Doesn't matter. That's the way Lucas wrote it, therefore he's mandated to actually spend some time developing the guy he prioritized :P
<Mega_Milk> oh shi--
<princess> and hes just chilling XD
<abrony> perv
<SirGanjalf> KABLOOEY
<thelonepony> Oh NOOOOO
<Buytoast> that palpatine?
<Lunar_Brony> that was hilarious
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: Yes
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Buytoast
<CK|Ded> Palpatine. XD
<Mega_Milk> ehh.........
<Buytoast> why does he look like a sleepless fatheaded frodo
<princess> bewm
<Nittany_Discord> No.
<Lunar_Brony> stormtroopers have the aims of, well, stormtroopers
<abrony> aww the blue guy
<SirGanjalf> <=That scene needed Wilhelm's Scream
<abrony> chainsaw?
<CK|Ded> lol
<Mega_Milk> -lol :D
<Lunar_Brony> dat button
<abrony> i heard a chainsaw?
<SirGanjalf> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: but now youre talking about development. developing a robot-assassin character is pointless. and what does this series offer that the movie doesnt, its pretty much shown that hes just dookus student and he kill stuff, same was shown in the movie
<Lunar_Brony> abrony you did
<taoumi> slowest elevato in the world
<CK|Ded> You guys are so dead
<J_E_Smith71> Even in the future you have to wait on elevators
<Mega_Milk> Awesome.
<Lunar_Brony> woah
<abrony> graaaaahgul
<twilight_sprinkle> oh thse things
<princess> this is why elevators suck
<twilight_sprinkle> i hated talking to them in kotor
<Mega_Milk> Roar :3
<twilight_sprinkle> it was just bulblublublbu
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: This series gave him an introduction. If he had shown up in Ep 3 without even this much, everyone would be bitching. :P
<abrony> hia :3
<SirGanjalf> ohai
<Mega_Milk> -lol grievous is so OP.
<Lunar_Brony> I find this part amusing
<ASoftFluffyThing> lol
<Applechip> well damn
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Also, he's a general in the army prior to Dooku's death. So yes, he IS a leader in the army.
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: but, again, what did this intro offer? nothing really. it just slows down the pace
<abrony> safty ball
<scout19_tf2> did the cis win yet
<thelonepony> Fus-ro-dah?
<Lunar_Brony> Greivous is OP. Mod should nerf
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Grevious.rar
<Applechip> fail
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: It explains where the fuck he came from.
<CK|Ded> Wilhelm!
<Dark_Horst> and there he was
<Ryunosuke> that wilhelm
<Spitfire> dat wilhem scream
<Wirisme> heard that
<Mega_Milk> wow missed every attack -lol
<abrony> lol fail cuz cant jump
<SirGanjalf> There he is!:D
<magmablock> It's Star Wars. Gotta have Willhelm
<Lunar_Brony> IKR?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: he came from a lab, which was obvious enough in the movie
<SirGanjalf> Suddenly Anakin is a Celtic warrior...
<abrony> its a trap
<Eddmario> magmablock: EVERYTHING needs Willhelm scream. Hell, doesn't MLP: FIM have a version of it?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DAT DODGE
<Emmie> Hello~
*Ponies47 Has returned
<Lunar_Brony> hi Emmie
<Wirisme> I hope so
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Hi, Emmie
<Mega_Milk> Emmie: Sup.
<Lunar_Brony> WB Ponies47
<thelonepony> hi Emmie
<Emmie> hai everypony ^^ whats thi
<thelonepony> wb Ponies47
<princess> wb n hi Ponies47
<Dken2021> hey Emmie
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Welcome back, Ponies47 :)
<Buytoast> oh shit he's going to oz
<abrony> awwwww so much learning!!!!
<Dark_Horst> trippy
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: So basically you're fine with major characters not having explanations. Good for you. Unfortunately that's not how good storytelling works.
<Buytoast> don't lose your house anakin
<Applechip> i think the lsd just kicked in
<scout19_tf2> hey Ponies47
<Emmie> what is this?
<Ponies47> Tanks thelonepony princess and AJIsAwesome|Homework :3
<Ponies47> And scout19_tf2
<Lunar_Brony> Emmie the GOOD Star Wars: The Clone Wars cartoon
<Eddmario> THey ripped this straight out of Ice Age...
<scout19_tf2> yea dnt forget me:D
<Emmie> All this toucing is making me paranoid after playing Binding of Issac TnT
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: youre avoiding the subject. im saying that he came from a lab, and it was obvious enough in the movie, so n intro needed, this intro provided nothing more
<Emmie> *touching
<abrony> ded
<Mega_Milk> Ghost arm cave drawing guy is so OP.
<Lunar_Brony> ^
<Dark_Horst> dat anakin analogy
<superretroworld> Ponies47: do you find it weird buying a pic of applejack beating up applebloom?
<Dken2021> ouch, genocide
<abrony> wut
<Squallken> THE FUCK WAS THAT?
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: I'm not avoiding the subject, I'm saying you're basically making up a story for him in your head, and using that to excuse the poor storytelling of them not giving any explanation for him themselves.
<Eddmario> Lots of Episode 3 forshadowing...
<Emmie> Dat music
<abrony> brewam
<Emmie> dodododoodododdoodod! DA DA! DA DA!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mostly but not completly
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: And the problem is, the fact that you can imagine his backstory doesn't excuse them from not having one.
<abrony> lol nope.avi
<Emmie> asplosions
<CK|Ded> Where are they coming from?
<CK|Ded> O.o
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: i dont see the interest in a movie spelling everyhting out for me. hes not a major character for the entire star wars saga, and giving him a fight intro like here would be pointless, waste time and slow down the pace
<Emmie> BOOOOM
<Eddmario> twilight_sprinkle, CK|Ded: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2375/
<Emmie> twilight_sprinkle stop arguing :c
<abrony> please da- ple-please
<Emmie> the argument isnt going anywhere
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: Not giving him an intro is not acceptable in proper storytelling. I'm fine with you choosing to forgive it. That doesn't make it okay.
<Caramel> 2,14 >implying internet arguments ever go anywhere
<Unnr|Angst> Out of curiosity, would a bollywood movie count as A or B?
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah but this was right before Episode 3 came out. This made us think that Grevious was going to be badass...but then Episode 3 came out and it was a let down
<Lunar_Brony> I missed an aruement?
<Emmie> http://static4.fjcdn.com/comments/OMG+are+we+going+to+discuss+opinions+now+thats+sooo+_e9a38ab665b358dda2dfeb3882f1ac8d.png SHUT UP
<Emmie> c:
<Lunar_Brony> *arguement
<Caramel> 2,14 Unnr|Angst I'd have to see the imdb, but given the stereotype I'd have to guess B
<Mega_Milk> Ha!
<abrony> nope
<twilight_sprinkle> ill stop. altho why am i always the first one being told to stop, i dont even say anything personal >.>
<CK|Ded> Emmie: If you have a problem with people actually discussing what they're watching, then there's always the option of not reading the chat. >_>
<IcY_> soooo many trains
<Kencolt> He WAS badass-- until Windu got in a parting shot that crippled his already ill-adapted systems.
<Unnr|Angst> Caramel: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2057441/
<Mega_Milk> oh shi--
<Unnr|Angst> It seems fitting
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: well thats another matter, i suppose they couldve made him cooler, thats true
<flutterchu> i liek trains
<J_E_Smith71> Dun dun dun
<CK|Ded> Emmie: Don't tell other people to stop discussing something if they're enjoying it just because you aren't, that's kind of dickish. Honestly.
<CK|Ded> lol
<Unnr|Angst> Oh crud, meant to send that as a PM...
<Unnr|Angst> >_<
<magmablock> :D
<J_E_Smith71> That troll move
<abrony> lol capes suck
<thelonepony> :D
<Dark_Horst> YOINK!
<Mega_Milk> friggin trains! :D
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, that's probably B
<CK|Ded> Reason Not To Wear A Cape #56
<taoumi> i liek trains
<Unnr|Angst> It was suprisingly good
<J_E_Smith71> NO CAPES!
<superretroworld> taoumi: so does sheldon
<Emmie> CK|Ded, I don't have a problem seeing you "dicuss" the chat, you're just kind of arguing and going nowhere with it. The text walls are kind of irritating and I just made one so I'll be quiet nao. >-<
<twilight_sprinkle> CK|Ded: last thing-there is no such thing as "proper story telling". if there were, then all stories would be the same. id prefer hints over obvious expositions of everything in the movie
<SirGanjalf> Unnr|Angst: We've already streamed the most expensive Bollywood movie in history as B movie so...
<princess> fact: people should never EVERa have capes
<Lunar_Brony> SirGanjalf what was that?
<princess> for you have seen what happend
<abrony> princess yup
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Capes are MLG~
<Unnr|Angst> SirGanjalf: but robot wasn't all that well meta-rated
<Applechip> princess: what about long coats?
<CK|Ded> twilight_sprinkle: No, there is such a thing as proper storytelling. It doesn't mandate every aspect of the design, but it does instruct "best policy" designs.
*Emmie has never watched star wars
<flutterchu> derpy advice #38 when you liek star wars.......youre doomed
<SirGanjalf> Lunar_Brony: Einhiran(or sth) a.k.a. "roboda"
<princess> nore coats say if your flying

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Because the Wii Us are going to be in black and white :)
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: Based on the box, I'm guessing they're Wii Motion Plus Controllers designed for the Wii U.
<Dante> one sec
<FlutterMEDIC> lol
<Adjeca> o.O
<FlutterMEDIC> i have to admit, Super Mario Sunshine was an awesome game
<Dante> is this a friend match or random cuz the feed is buffering alot for me

<Saturn> 08,01Zuxxez123: it's unlikely he'll be able to do anything, though
<Zuxxez123> Saturn: We can hope though.

<FlutterMEDIC> Zuxxez123: and suddenly you realise its someone's backside
<Adjeca> yep
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Saturn. Sorry, I was getting a virtual haircut. trippy, man

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02gg :)
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: whos giu the virtual haircut?
<Kimori> yeah I posted a cheaper guide

<superretroworld> giving*
<Zuxxez123> I'll see if I can in later days. :D
<Zuxxez123> I would love to get my ass kicked on a live stream where everyone can mock my skills. :P
<FlutterMEDIC> PEACH
<Kimori> If your getting that guide book, can you send me a pic of the poster?
<Adjeca> of course :)
<AJIsAwesome> I used to be a master with Mario and Marth.
<Kimori> thanks
<FlutterMEDIC> wait, why would you choose Peach?
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld a guy who, apparantely, was called Luigi. LovelyVirus on YouTube
<Kimori> I'm hoping that its not some generic picture
<AJIsAwesome> Well, I wouldn't say "master", just very good at using them.
<Sylandest> FlutterMEDIC: dont underestimate peach. She can be vicious, hehe
<Dken2021> FlutterMEDIC sorry, chat lag, only watched the parts at the beginning
<Cades> so many terrible but funny spyro videos...
<AJIsAwesome> Sylandest: Exactly.
<AJIsAwesome> Especially Melee.

<Kimori> Ive been wanting to buy the guide for the game anyways
<Zuxxez123> Ha-Cha!
<Dken2021> especially mastering hovering and attacking
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: i also love dodging in mid air
<AJIsAwesome> I remember the impact would cause an explosion.
<AJIsAwesome> Never underestimate Peach's hips. :D
<Applechip> It's really hard to fight Mr. Game & Watch. Just from looking at him it's nearly impossible to judge what his actions will be.
<Adjeca> heh
<Slen> I said HER AIM IS GETTIN' BETTER!
<AJIsAwesome> Applechip: True, considering his frames of animation are very short.
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/BUCKNER-GARCIA-Pac-Man-Fever-LP-Columbia-1982-w-Inner-Sleeve-MINT-/200819269438?pt=Music_on_Vinyl&hash=item2ec1c2df3e&nma=true&si=iTAwlv4DkcASvF3rGawy3V653p0%3D&orig_cvip=true&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2557

<Slen> You see, it's funny because HER AIM IS GETTIN' BETTER!
<Adjeca> what be this?

<Kimori> This is one of the songs on the vinyl
<DanteD> darnit
<Yahooz> DanteD: you need a friend code
<DanteD> yeah
<Dken2021> oh the friendcode, such a tedious manner

<Kandarihu> Spamming thundershock from the burning floor. That's some funny imagery right there
<Zuxxez123> That's kind of you Lyra` :P
<Lyra`> ikr, Zuxxez123, a lesser poni would hold a grudge
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: I never knew Pikachu tastes like Spam. :O
<HatsuneMikuFan> LOL
<Zuxxez123> Indeed.
<Petrified_Discord> LAAAAAAAAAAWL
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: that reminds me of a picture i saw, that i want to unsee so badl, but cant...
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: Pffft :)
<Crystaline_Shard> if i play aginst a pikachu and i catch them spamming I ignore everyone else in the match and kill them.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Oh, my....
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Dante> but the spam is funnn
<[Alpha-Trinity]> Lawl?
<Zuxxez123> Spam? I DON'T LIKE SPAM!
<HatsuneMikuFan> I'm guessing the person who played as Pikachu is now play as Captain Falcon
<Dante> or falco?
<Petrified_Discord> but Falcon Punch spam is glorious
<Crystaline_Shard> probs falco
<Kandarihu> I heard an excellent way to troll in SSBM is to play Kirby in a 4 player match, and just run off to the side away from the action and just spam the taunt all match.
<Dante> but falco can spam FOREVER
<Petrified_Discord> Kandarihu: "HIIIIIIIIIII!"
<Zuxxez123> Battle of the spammers!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The person who played as Pikachu also likes to use Falco o3o
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I see people are playing on the best stage ever
<Kandarihu> HiiiIIIII
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also
<Crystaline_Shard> theres a better way to kirby troll
<LightTrooper105> lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>Captain Falcon
<Dante> pikachu can do multiple spams so i liek em :D
<Crystaline_Shard> suck in a player jump off the stage
<Buytoast> oh boy, big blue
<AJIsAwesome> Kirbycide?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>not Falcon Punching at all times
<Crystaline_Shard> take them with you!
<Kandarihu> This really IS an awesome stage
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm sad
<Zuxxez123> If you aren't spamming Falcon Paunch, you aren't good Falcon pilot.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, so dis is replays
<Dante> TOON LINK :D
<Crystaline_Shard> that stage is really fun with bunny hoods and mini
<Crystaline_Shard> you can race the cars
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I'm trying to remember if Falcon Punch in Brawl- does something
<Petrified_Discord> Crystaline_Shard: It's Brawl's version of Icicle Mountain, hammers only :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I know Warlock Punch will either insta kill you or opponent
<Kandarihu> I liked Pokefloats too. Anyone else?
<Derpy_Hooves> i have a big feeling that that toon link is me .-.
<Dante> oh yeah! that was cool
<HatsuneMikuFan> I like Ppokefloats
<HatsuneMikuFan> Pokefloats*
<superretroworld> HatsuneMikuFan: best stage ever
<Crystaline_Shard> warlock punch and falcon punch are high dmg the differince being the direction and vector falcon tends to go more upward but it hits harder
<Dante> i could never stay on them for long though, was never good at that stage
<Petrified_Discord> I had a group of friends that would only play Hyrule Temple. ONLY. Like, all the time. :[
<HatsuneMikuFan> I wouldn't say best stage ever, but I liked it.
<Dante> temple is teh best though
<Dante> i mean
<Dante> um
<Dante> i liked it
<superretroworld> Petrified_Discord: thats a great stage
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Temple is okay stage, but Big Blue is da besst
<Crystaline_Shard> warlock goes up or out one or the other.
<Crystaline_Shard> it's weaker though
<Derpy_Hooves> ya this one is me and NewSuperBronyU
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: You seem quiet, wanna chat about something?
<Petrified_Discord> My personal fave was Corneria.
<superretroworld> Petrified_Discord: which version?
<Dante> still like temple teh best being a LOZ fan
<Petrified_Discord> superretroworld: There are different ones?
<Buytoast> not only playing on final destination
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Sure. :)
<Buytoast> do you even spuer smash bros?
<HatsuneMikuFan> I liked Fountain of Dreams
<superretroworld> Petrified_Discord: the n64 one or the gb one?
<Petrified_Discord> superretroworld: Oh lol, gb
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02That last one was me and Derpy ><
<Derpy_Hooves> NewSuperBronyU: you didnt save the one where we won D:!!!!
<Zuxxez123> So, what kind of games do you enjoy playing the most?
<Petrified_Discord> superretroworld: I never got why there were what I assumed to be unfinished buildings floating in space in the 64 version :P
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: ^
<Dante> lol
<[Alpha-Trinity]> ...crackers are a good snack...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Derpy_Hooves: i tried ;3;
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fightan gaems
<Crystaline_Shard> I like the stage but the random effects from the minigames are annoying.
<Kandarihu> Well, Fountain of Dreams was pretty much just a standard Battlefield layout. But I liked the sound of Kirby music performed by a full-piece orchestra.
<Crystaline_Shard> see one person get's star
<Dante> oh the stay still one is great when playing CPU's in this map :D
<Crystaline_Shard> annoying
<HatsuneMikuFan> Kandarihu: That is why I liked it
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Streeurt Ferrters
<SaxyPretender> 0,14pfft
<Zuxxez123> Lol.
<superretroworld> Petrified_Discord: just for show maybe, bthe gb one was to small
<SaxyPretender> 0,14more like Persona 4 Arena
<AJIsAwesome> Never played Persona? How is it?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I get at that animu swag
<Zuxxez123> Aw snap! I've never played it...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Persona's arguably the best 2D fighter right now
<AJIsAwesome> *Persona.
<Buytoast> isn;t that theg ame where you get cockblocked and then kill yourself?
<AJIsAwesome> It is? Hmm.....seems interesting.
<Zuxxez123> Ezherig: King of the Ring (of something like that) was my first fighter game experience.
<Petrified_Discord> Buytoast: :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14really accessible, still has lots of depth
<Crystaline_Shard> big metal asking or a instant kill
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nice and fast, good mechanics
<Crystaline_Shard> marth was smarth would of grabed and thrown

<superretroworld> night [Alpha-Trinity]
<Zuxxez123> I felt the same, I dunno why.. Petrified_Discord

<Zuxxez123> Oh my AJIsAwesome... Got some strong feelings there. :P
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: agreed
<Unnr|Angst> I was always a fan of Talim in SC 2
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Sorry. It's the awards that you get for completing it is strenous. :$
<Zuxxez123> :3
<AJIsAwesome> I only killed what? 3 guys?
<AJIsAwesome> I think you need 10?
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe 15?
<Crystaline_Shard> I got to four then the fith got lucky and i rage quit.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I never got why Link was the worst character in he game
<Zuxxez123> xD
<superretroworld> NewSuperBronyU: you got everything, good job
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: He is? I heard he was the best. :S
<Dante> yeah
<superretroworld> SaxyPretender: he was good in melee
<Crystaline_Shard> AJIsAwesome: best for weapon master yes.
<Dante> and i've heard from my friends he's "cheap"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14took a look at the SC2 tier list one day
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14was at the total bottom
<SaxyPretender> 0,14below the guest characters even
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<AJIsAwesome> That's strange.
<Petrified_Discord> SaxyPretender: Maybe it has something to do with his projectiles?
<Crystaline_Shard> SaxyPretender: he was a guest charactor too so saying hes below them is not saying much :/
<Buytoast> that's because butthurt sony and microsoft fans were upset they didn't get master chief or parappa the rapper
<Zuxxez123> Lol.
<Derpy_Hooves> NO
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02D:
<Petrified_Discord> The soul edge as a microphone. Parappa is OP

<Dante> brawl???
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Agreed.
<Invi> j
<Invi> a
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02D:
<Crystaline_Shard> NewSuperBronyU: that is a sick joke to play on derpy.
<flutterchu> master chief belongs to microsoft SSB belongs to nintendo so that means master chief wont be in the next super smash bros
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02joke? :<
<superretroworld> i heard a rumor the creator of crash bandicot was a brony
<AJIsAwesome> I can't even see Parappa having a decent moveset in fighting games.
<Crystaline_Shard> Cruel brawl :/
<flutterchu> microsoft and nintendo are big rivials
<Zuxxez123> flutterchu: Sonic belongs to Sega, but it's in a Nintendo game.
<Lyra`> NewSuperBronyU, why you got to build me up buttercup?
<Lyra`> just to tear me down?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Parappa's moveset will consist of
<flutterchu> Zuxxez123: there's no halo game that's licensed by nintendo

<SaxyPretender> 0,14>punching

<superretroworld> Lyra`: havent heard that song in years
<Invi> AJIsAwesome, he was a brony? at that time?
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Petrified_Discord> Parappa would be super hard to hit with vertical attacks since he's 2D
<AJIsAwesome> Invi: I didn't say that. superretroworld did.
<Buytoast> all i've played of parappa the rapper was that demo dick that had that intellegence cube game and that skyro demo
<Crystaline_Shard> Zuxxez123: that's because sonic get's on nintendo alot sega needs it some tendo to play it's games because it's pretty much the only consel that still sells sonic games well
<Buytoast> never got past it
<Crystaline_Shard> They also got Solid snake
<Buytoast> demo disk
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...hell of a typo
<superretroworld> hes not a brony anymore?
<flutterchu> hard to imagina parrappa in smash bros universe
<Crystaline_Shard> Dunno how they managed snake.
<Invi> AJIsAwesome, oh ok nvm then. it's early in the morning
<Zuxxez123> Lyra`: And mess me round? And the worst of all, he never called when he said he would...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14MGS1 had a GCN port

<Crystaline_Shard> Well there you go Saxy is a bigger nerd then me!

<SaxyPretender> 0,14also also, not quite, flutterchu
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the only Soul Calibur staff guy on the new Smash is the sound director
<AJIsAwesome> I'm considering getting it. Combat seems interesting.
<Crystaline_Shard> They give SSBU weaponmaster like :/
<flutterchu> it will be for nintendo WII U and nintendo 3DS
<Zuxxez123> Just the sound director.. Wow...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey, in my book, that's awesome
<Petrified_Discord> But they do have the main team from Tekken
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Soul Calibur's got an amazing soundtrack
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and yeah, think most of the advisers are from Tekken
<Petrified_Discord> Never really a fan of Tekken, but it has retained it's individuality over the years
<Crystaline_Shard> I cryed myself to sleep after perfecting weaponmaster.
<Zuxxez123> Not saying it's bad, I love SC's music, but going from a team, just a music director.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14true, would be nice if they got Junichi Nakatsuru and the rest of them

<Crystaline_Shard> That ping.
<twilight_sprinkle> Zuxxez123: at the pro levels yeah, thats whats required to win
<Crystaline_Shard> keep thinking ponies are talking to me.

<Petrified_Discord> I remember a lot of Kilik's moves were just "hit button _ repeatedly". He was REALLY fun to buttonmash with :D
<twilight_sprinkle> but then some stupid glitch happened and i couldnt register for world tourneys anymore until i beat my own high scores, which was way too hard seeing how i already made it to 40 in the world..
<Crystaline_Shard> Called it air walk'n :/ it involved knocking the enemy into the air and then jumping on them with the down stab done right you get all three stabs in
<Zuxxez123> Petrified_Discord: Totally, the range he had, along with the speed he seemed to have... Made button mashing fun. xD
