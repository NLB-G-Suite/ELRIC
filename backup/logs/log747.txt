<DoctoDoctorWho> DoctoDoctorWho: You didnt scare me away, my dad just walked in and I had to abort.
<RoboGerbil> abort abort!
<MadSurge> :( Shizustream no more
<DoctoDoctorWho> Code red! Parental figure & ponies within similar proximity!
<DoctoDoctorWho> :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: what were we even talking about?
<RoboGerbil> chats ded and i just arrived, i dunno
<CrystalPhoenix> You're a liar! I can see it in your eyes! http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m63vbxtOza1rvl3xdo1_500.gif
<Jageman> something about an unstoppable robot or somthing
<alexxm> Jageman what are you talking about
<Nimbaws> Since no more stream I'm going to go play Dark Souls, I may be back later everypony. Bai :)
<Jageman> alexxm: something with DoctoDoctorWho
<alexxm> bye Ninbaws
<CrystalPhoenix> BEHOLD http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5labdnQ6J1rvl3xdo2_1280.png
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: ah yes, the Juggernaut Mk V ultra heavy combat avatar, good times.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: Science for the win.
<CrystalPhoenix> This look so goddang creepy http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m48yk7aTSc1rvl3xdo1_1280.png
<DoctoDoctorWho> I think the primary armor layer was a titanium matrix covered in carbon nanotubes
<alexxm> CrystalPhoenix does that mean that applejack is ass faced
<MadSurge> CrystalPhoenix: lolwut :D
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: are you watching it?
<DoctoDoctorWho> which itself was covered in a plastic compound called starlight
<SafariMonkey> Yep Jageman. :P
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Hello bronystate.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hai BRUSHYOURTEETH
<alexxm> how are things BRUSHYOURTEETH
<SafariMonkey> Hey BRUSHYOURTEETH! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> nou
<AttackWithHugs> Hey BRUSHYOURTEETH
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: which would be too heavy and woud still be subseptable to heat.
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: the later episodes are better, the maths episode is funny
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: The second suggestion was look around you maths. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: According to the laws of physics yes, but there are no human weapons, not even thermonuclear warheads capable of generating that much heat.
<CrystalPhoenix> Behold the Twilight Saga http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4x23hzg8c1rvl3xdo2_1280.png

<Sonny> night Invi
<MadSurge> Nighty Invi!
<DoctoDoctorWho> g'night Invi
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: The first one has a faceless man... [slender]
<Invi> haibai Sonny
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Night Invi
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: no through brute force, no
<Sonny> and Hello Bornystate :3
<TheMaster> asuka pony? this can only end badly
<SafariMonkey> night Invi! :)
<alexxm> bye Invi
<SafariMonkey> Hi Sonny
<MadSurge> Hey Sonny!
<SafariMonkey> :)
<alexxm> how've you been Sonny]
<Sonny> no stream on I see?
<Sonny> good alexxm ;) thanks
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: but we can create more heat then a nuke now through the use of lasers
<Sonny> Oh guys
<Sonny> I'm gonna draw King Sombra in a bit
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: Only localised
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: so as far as human weapons are concerned, it is effectively immune to heat based attackes
<Sonny> It's going really well so far, if you want you can join :)
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: true
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: but did you account for internal heating
<Sonny> or... not... ofcourse...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: and they tested it with high powered lasers as well, it didnt even scorch.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: that sounds like aerogel
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: are you talking about venting? as in heat vents to cool off the engine?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: yes
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: Its called starlite, look it up its really cool.(reaaly cool, immune to heat, lol)
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: if external heat is not the weakness, then internal heat would be

<Sonny> Guys?
<Derpy_Hooves> hey hey hey :3
<Sonny> 6_9 ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sonny.
<Sonny> oh hi Nittany_Discord
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: I plan on venting it out through the joints, if that doesnt work then I'll add microscopic tubing throughout the armor like they did in star wars
<Sonny> I think I'm gonna draw a bit, I'll be streaming it so if you feel like it you could check it out Nittany_Discord and all other ponies :p
<DoctoDoctorWho> dont bash it, that is totally feasable
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: that would not work. the airflow would not be enough
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I saw Sonny.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Might drop in there.
<Sonny> alrighty then :)
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: also, you never mentioned the power source
<DoctoDoctorWho> hello Nittany_Discord, nice seeing you again.
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: the ghost episode is hillarious
<Sonny> so anyhow I was just letting you guys know, ciao
<Sonny> bye
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: that is the one area Im not sure about, power.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ive gtg, see you in maybe an hour
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: later
<SafariMonkey> DoctoDoctorWho: That kind of venting is used in inscts, and is the reason why they have so limited size.
<SafariMonkey> *insects
<SafariMonkey> See ya Jageman
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: your going too?
<SafariMonkey> Oh my bad wrong person. Bye DoctoDoctorWho! :P

<Shizuka> 13oh :3
<Shizuka> 13like the burn notice chain :3
<CrystalPhoenix> This chat is full modded
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<XAX> Someone found a link to that song in the background of the S3 commercial. GIDDY UP GIDDY UP GIDDY UP UP.
<GilDash> Even when you think they're sleeping, they're watching... lurking... in the shadows...
<Phase4> 00,02aparently i havent got many doubles
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Giddy+Up/4grE6P/overview?src=5
<Phase4> 00,02over 4 days of unique music
<Phase4> 00,02not including my unsorted stuff
<Sumica> 00,10like the show but with work and work I hsve not watched it in ages
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX I saw it this morning before work
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: You've been lurking.
<CrystalPhoenix> it was in my head ALL THE TIME
<Sumica> 00,10only 4 days Phase4?
<Sumica> 00,10llame
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: know this feel.
<spyrofan001> hey
<XAX> Phase4: Check my doubles.
<XAX> : |
<Phase4> 00,02i've got 2.4GB unlabeled mp3's and other misc things that i need to replace
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, o_O
<CrystalPhoenix> Giddy up up should've been the meme
<CrystalPhoenix> it's such a catchy tune
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: You cannot escape.
<CrystalPhoenix> I kinda wonder when will someone make a remix of the actual MP3
<XAX> Someone made a remix.
<XAX> Before the original was even found.
<CrystalPhoenix> Yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> the extracted version
<XAX> He plucked the "giddy up" vocals from teh commercial lol
<CrystalPhoenix> the extracted wasn't really that great
<XAX> Nah
<XAX> Vocals were 2quiet4me
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX though the remix was alright
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah
<XAX> Haven't listened all the way through...
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hay everypony :)
<XAX> Sap Sketch_Toku_Brony
<CrystalPhoenix> but now that we have the full version
<CrystalPhoenix> someone needs to remix it
<CrystalPhoenix> shame only 4chan knows about it
<XAX> It'll be on EqD eventually...
<CrystalPhoenix> doubt it
<XAX> The only brone musicians I know that browse /mlp/ is Yelling at Cats
<stallion1> hey guys
<XAX> And he does rap, not remixes
<CrystalPhoenix> Yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353019420254.png I do not believe this
<MadSurge> You better believe!
<CrystalPhoenix> tried it myself
<CrystalPhoenix> he guess Lyra from the show first
<CrystalPhoenix> continuing on he asked about MLP fanfiction
<CrystalPhoenix> I was doomed from that question
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: There's variations.
<XAX> It can work out individual characters from Fallout: Equestria.
<CrystalPhoenix> this reminds me
<CrystalPhoenix> I need to read End of Ponies
<Sumica> 00,10why would you read somthing you will one day experence
<Phase4> 00,02"Ive always thought that one of the the great thing about physics is that you can add more digits to any number and see what happens and nobody can stop you." http://what-if.xkcd.com/20/

<CrystalPhoenix> just an author
<CrystalPhoenix> the one of Background Pony
<Alchemist> this is genius:D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNFAsKwCCHw
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: Someone put the song on YouTube, so someone will probably shoot it in to EqD.
<CrystalPhoenix> oh dear
<XAX> EqD can sometimes be a good site. But the comment section.
<aniderp1> sorry net d/c
<Punkie_Pue> Alchemist: :D
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX well yeah it depedns
<CrystalPhoenix> though don't rely on it for news
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Meghan McCarthy Interviewed on JustUs Geeks
<CrystalPhoenix> only for fan-made content
<XAX> I mostly get art from art dumps on /mlp/ now.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: k im back
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX lawl me too
<XAX> I very occasionally get art from draw friends
<CrystalPhoenix> heck I barely save picture
<XAX> I have about 600 wallpapers ._.
<XAX> Best part is, they're unsorted.
<MadSurge> Sumica: let's hope the end of ponies doesn't kill the fandom :D highly doubt it anyway
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: hello? still here?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: im in a private chat with SafariMonkey
<DoctoDoctorWho> oh, k
<SafariMonkey> Sorry DoctoDoctorWho

<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase4: are you done fixing technical things yet?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me and LC have interviewed together before.
<stallion1> wow
<MadSurge> Hullo RainbowPie :)
<The_Engineer> Hi everybody :(
<Phase4> 00,02DoctoDoctorWho, not really in a fanfic mood right now, working on music library
<DoctoDoctorWho> k fine
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: what were we talking about?
<RainbowPie> Ohey MadSurge! haven't seen you for awhile where you been hiding? :D
<The_Engineer> Hey Phase4 :D ow ;c
<GilDash> Bloody hell, I've got to redo my music library soon. Not really looking forwards to that. :S
<MadSurge> RainbowPie: I lurk and play :O
<Phase4> 00,02ohai The_Engineer
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: The Juggernaut Mk V ultra heavy combat avatar.
<CrystalPhoenix> lolxsplittrial
<The_Engineer> I'M IN PAIN Phase4 Save me ;c
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and its non-existant power source?
<DoctoDoctorWho> that yes
*Phase4 00,02gives The_Engineer some chocolate
<The_Engineer> I dont need chocolate
<The_Engineer> I mean
<Phase4> 00,02D:
<Phase4> 00,02who doesnt need chocolate
<The_Engineer> My chest hurts everytime I breath and It really hurts
<Sumica> 00,10hey Phase4, anly luck with that embed?
<Alchemist> The_Engineer: did you crack a rib?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, cant reproduce the problem without a stream
<The_Engineer> Don't think so
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im estimating it to be roughly 30 feet tall, ot may be big enough to just conventionally fuel it.
<The_Engineer> DSAUDHAS
<The_Engineer> GODDAMIT THIS HURTS
<Bronysith> The_Engineer: hold your breath for 30 seconds and then take very slow breaths
<Sumica> 00,10no I ment the twichTV embed
<The_Engineer> I'M OUT
<Phase4> 00,02The_Engineer, if its that bad why arent you seeing a doctor instead of asking strangers on the internet?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah, it doenst happen unless theres a stream
<CrystalPhoenix> so who's using Xsplit trial?
<Sumica> 00,10the error?
<Phase4> 00,02thats my guess anyway
<Sumica> 00,10realy?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02well it wasnt shoing up
<Phase4> 00,02showing'
<Sumica> 00,10cause some were geting the error yesterday
<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase4: cuz we are a very intelligent and supportive community of friends
<Sumica> 00,10with no stream
<Sumica> 00,10where as otheres got no error
<Phase4> 00,02DoctoDoctorWho, you're a doctor, fix him!
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, bizare
*DoctoDoctorWho scratches head
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<The_Engineer> Phase4 because its 3:08 AM and my parents are asleep and it just starting happening.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01inb4 kidney stone.
<Sumica> 00,10oh btw Phase4, did you want a beta key for planetside 2
<Sumica> 00,10it's only 5 days left but enough to try it
<The_Engineer> If I never come on I'm dead guys :c
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, sure
<SpeccyRush> regardless of what time it is, if you are in pain wake your parents up
<Phase4> 00,02The_Engineer, yeah, if its that bad just wake them, get to a doctor
<DoctoDoctorWho> The_Engineer: You really should wake them and tell them they need to get you to a fucking hospital, this sounds serious
<GilDash> If you can't breath easy and you have chest pains call an ambulance.
<XAX> Sumica: Can we play later? I have no idea what I'm doing.
<Sumica> 00,10Suppose so XAX
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: so yeah, conventional fuel.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: not powerful enough
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: your armor would be too heave
<Jageman> heavy*
<The_Engineer> I'm gonna have a heart attack any second now
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im using hydraulics in place of muscles, and this would be too heavy?
<Jageman> ya
<Jageman> not enought power to move them
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah, i cant reproduce the issue here
<VenHur> Yeesh, Engineer, get to a fucking hospital already!
<DoctoDoctorWho> The_Engineer: Dude, get your fucking parents and get to a hospital, your starting to scare me.
<VenHur> Don't just stand there and dillydally!
<BaconMane> 0,5Oheyi
<VenHur> Hey BaconMane.
<AlienWarhead> Hi bronystate

<AlienWarhead> much
<BaconMane> 0,5Your name is "AttackWithHugs" >>
<VenHur> BaconMane: Is your mane REALLY tasted like bacon?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I actually sound good in this interview.
<The_Engineer> Well my chest pain is starting to stop so I guess I'm gonna live longer now
<BaconMane> 0,5Is not >>
<AttackWithHugs> Yes it is. I randomly hug people, thus the name was created
<Sumica> 00,10back in a few, upgrading system memory
<BaconMane> 0,5Wait a sec
<DoctoDoctorWho> brb
<BaconMane> 0,5am I in this interview? >>
<BaconMane> 0,5O: I am
<sub06905> Haunts your dreams: http://imgur.com/nQvd5
<Phase4> 00,02ok, this is anoying
<sub06905> :>
<Phase4> 00,02the planetside account requires at least 8 characters, one of them must be a number, for the password
<Punkie_Pue> sub06905: Its not like i wanted to sleep or anything.
<Phase4> 00,02and cant compare correctly
<CrystalPhoenix> sub06905, defeating your sandwich only makes it tastier
<sub06905> polish spitfire
<Phase4> 00,02but 1234567890 is a totaly valid password that it considers secure
<sub06905> CrystalPhoenix, :D
<GilDash> Nah, password is the most secure.
<MadSurge> Ohai GilDash :D
<Jageman> CrystalPhoenix: i have seen you say that before.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<RoboGerbil> i have the same password on my luggage
<CrystalPhoenix> Jageman, possibly or maybe it was someone else
<CrystalPhoenix> it's from a video
<CrystalPhoenix> you surely know about it
<Kandarihu> Man, I really wish I could get into Planetside 2. But the client is rejecting my GPU
<Jageman> no
<Phase4> 00,02i thought the world had outgrown secret questions
<Phase4> 00,02aparnetly not
<Punkie_Pue> http://howsecureismypassword.net/ is a pretty good tool for evauluating password security.
<Phase4> 00,02Punkie_Pue, 'password security' is a mostly flawed concept
<Punkie_Pue> how so?
<GilDash> I hate secret questions. How the hell is my mother's maiden name more secure then my password if I forget it?
<sub06905> >4 quattuordecillion years
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, secret questions are just aditional passwords with hints
<Phase4> 00,02Punkie_Pue, http://xkcd.com/936/
<GilDash> Phase4: Yeah, but some of the begger belief. The best one I saw was one that let you write the question and the answer.
<sub06905> ohai AJIsAwesome
<sub06905> :>
<Phase4> 00,02a much better solution than passowrds is public key crypto
<Phase4> 00,02it is MORE SECURE than passwords and does not require any user interaction for authentication
<GilDash> Phase4: Yeah, I think you're going over my head now. XD
<CrystalPhoenix> throwing colgate in as colgate is a bad idea
<CrystalPhoenix> throwing in colgate as minuette would be much better
<Punkie_Pue> Thats the method i am going to be moving towards
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, sub06905. :)
<Phase4> 00,02i log into my servers with greater security than my banks website
<AlienWarhead> hi AJIsAwesome
<GilDash> That's... pretty good.
<XAX> Phase4: Maximum overkill.
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, it is really easy
<Record_Discord> Lookin' forward to tomorrow night guys!
*AJIsAwesome hugs sub06905 and AlienWarhead. :)
<GilDash> Phase4: There must be some downside, surely?
<Phase4> 00,02its not "ENTER FIVE BAJILION CHARACTER PASSWORDS"
<XAX> Tomorrow?
<XAX> OH
<XAX> PONE
<XAX> wait
<Phase4> 00,02its public key crypto
<XAX> Movie night?
*AlienWarhead hugs AJIsAwesome back
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, Nope, automatic login
*Record_Discord high fives AlienWarhead
<Phase4> 00,02the 'password' is a 4k text file, which contains the private key
<Record_Discord> Movie Night!
<AJIsAwesome> Does anyone have an image of Diamond Tiara saying "just as planned" on their stream?
*AlienWarhead brohoofs Record_Discord
<Record_Discord> Plus ponies on Saturday!
<XAX> I personally can't wait for new pone. Too many Pinkie pies.
<GilDash> Phase4: Couldn't you just find that and use it as an attacker?
*Record_Discord brohoofs right back /][\
<AJIsAwesome> owait
<SafariMonkey> Phase4: I know what you mean, I 'hacked' into the smithsonian's displays wirelessly from my mobile phone whe I was there. :P
<AlienWarhead> AJIsAwesome: Yes
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, the only 'downside' is that you need that file, and cant really remember it
<AJIsAwesome> It's an interview. :P
<Record_Discord> I can't wait for ponies!
<AJIsAwesome> I had my volume muted. :P
<XAX> I hope the too many pinkie pies all melt into pink smooze.
<CrystalPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, a quick google gave me this link http://www.derpibooru.org/100011?scope=scpe9bf936b7bfac9c99f75786928ece750c4921bf16
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, thats how its secure, you NEED that file to authenticate and encrypt, the security in that system is kepign that file secret
<Mihoshika> Who's streaming?
<Buytoast> what's this now?
<Record_Discord> Pink Smooze?
<AJIsAwesome> CrystalPhoenix: Ah.
<AJIsAwesome> Interview with Mr. Poniator, I think?
<GilDash> Phase4: That's kind of like writing your password down though, surely?
<XAX> Record_Discord: Nothing can stop it.
<AlienWarhead> Why does Derpgate come up in every interview?
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, its many times easier to keep a file secret than a password, its imposible to guess a private key
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: k back,
<Mihoshika> Can't understand what he's saying at all.
<Record_Discord> XAX: NOTHING
<GilDash> Phase4: Impossible or just very impractical?
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, in a way, but i don't have to share my private key to authenticate
<Phase4> 00,02it never leaves the computer
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, imposible
<AlienWarhead> Phase4 nothing is uncrackable
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: conventional energy sources would not be powerful enough to move your robots heavy armor
<Record_Discord> Well, I'ma leave, see all you fabulous men tomorrow
<Phase4> 00,02AlienWarhead, you try break rsa then
<AlienWarhead> later Record_Discord
<Phase4> 00,02its not possible without a brute force attack (untill quantum computers come through anyway)_
<Phase4> 00,02and such an attack would take centuries with current computers
<AlienWarhead> Phase4: I'm going into cybersecurity its going to be my job to think that
<GilDash> Phase4: So possible, just unfeasible.
<DoctoDoctorWho> A titanium/CNT matrix covered in plastic cant be TOO heavy compared to alternatives
<RainbowBash> :P
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, impossible == so unfeasible its not going to happen
<thelonepony> i'm back everypony :)
<Punkie_Pue> Hi thelonepony !
<RainbowBash> Hello thelonepony
<Punkie_Pue> do you think stegenography is a better alternitive?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, thelonepony! :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase4: Unless your a transformer haxbot, then it takes 5 seconds
<GilDash> Phase4: True, but you never know. I would have thought it bad practice to tout anything as "impossible to crack">
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: it depends on how tall the robot is
<SafariMonkey> Oh hey thelonepony. :)
<thelonepony> Hi Punkie_Pue RainbowBash AJIsAwesome and SafariMonkey :)
<thelonepony> :3
<Phase4> 00,02DoctoDoctorWho, well yeah, but they probably have quantum computers which via some math magic they can solve the factorization problem that makes rsa secure, there are other crypto systems being researched that are 'quantum safe' though
<The_Engineer> Hi everybody I'm back because computer decided RANDOM RESTART! TROLOLOLO
<Punkie_Pue> lol troll computer
<thelonepony> Hi The_Engineer :)
<Buytoast> please
<Buytoast> no
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, its easier to say imposible than explain unfesibility to every silly person who belives that any posibility == insecure
<DoctoDoctorWho> GilDash: nonsense, its like calling large ships unsinkable. wait...
<RainbowBash> Hello The_Engineer
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: like I said, roughly 30 feet
<shana> AlienWarhead: one time pad is uncrackable (ciphertext and plaintext are statistically independent)
<Phase4> 00,02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography heres an explination
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: even without armor, nothing provides enough power to move it
<GilDash> Phase4: Alright, fair enough. I tend to be a little too pedantic for my own good sometimes. :)
<CrystalPhoenix> that xsplit watermark
<Phase4> 00,02well one time pad is the single exception but it requires a key with as much entropy as the data being sent and the key can only be used once
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: nothing that could fit inside it anyway
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: we have engines powerful enough to move large machinery like that
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, is fine, it is an important distinction but not for the average joe
<shana> yup, but it is actually useful (and has ben used) in pratice
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: what are you ranting about now?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: nothing that is bipedal
<shana> so many typos :(
<Punkie_Pue> There is a video on youtube that does an excelent job explaining public key exchange.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: the Juggernaut armor
<Dovah> ah
<Buytoast> did i hear my math lab?
<Phase4> 00,02point is, public key > passwords
<GilDash> Phase4: Computers have always fascinated me, but I'm shamed to say I honestly don't know half as much as I would like to.
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, start learning then :P
<Phase4> 00,02internet is full of information about computers
<Phase4> 00,02funny that
<Dovah> Jageman: someone built a semi working mech in their back yard
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: a lot of power would be wasted keeping it balanced, not to mention using any kind of onboard weapons
<GilDash> Phase4: Yes, but how much of it is true? XD
<Phase4> 00,02GilDash, a suprising ammount if you stay away from news sites
<GilDash> Phase4: Yeah, even I know enough to know the BBC cocks it up. XD
<Jageman> Dovah: and? someone built a ufo that stays up without moving parts, but its about 6 inches in diameter
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: we have walking robots right now, by the time I have the resources to implement this, balance wont be a problem
<Buytoast> hey now
<Buytoast> Faux news is 100% reliable
<AlienWarhead> Excellent security conversation guys, I'll get to public key in a few weeks in my security no hard feelings everypony <3
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: balance will always be a problem
<Phase4> 00,02well screw you sony
<Dovah> Jageman: its 2 stories tall and can do sit ups and stand.
<AlienWarhead> security class I mean
<Phase4> 00,02they put that thing on their logins that prevents the browser from saving your password
<Jageman> Dovah: your point?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: not to mention balance only comes into play if the vehicle is moving
<Dovah> Jageman: not as hard as you'd think to make it balanced
<Phase4> 00,02net increse in securyty == negative, i now have to make my password easier to remember and can easily loose it, requiring the secret question which is even less secure
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: you need to balance, even when standing still
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and balance is not the main issue
<DoctoDoctorWho> If we have engines to move this mofo, we can move the 30 foot robot http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawler-transporter
<MadSurge> Well guys, time for me to go to bed. See you tomorrow!
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and how fast does it go, hmmm?
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, MadSurge.:)
<AlienWarhead> bye MadSurge
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: Hey!! no none image links during stream!! :)
<AlienWarhead> goodbye bronystate
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, AlienWarhead. :)
<sub06905> bai AlienWarhead
<thelonepony> Bye AlienWarhead :)
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: if you abandon the shape, it becomes potentionaly possible
<AlienWarhead> thanks guys
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: I dont expect it to be fast, I expect it to be durable. I expect 15-20 mph tops
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: you would not get it to move at all
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: thats only video
<Punkie_Pue> DoctoDoctorWho: Its top speed is 1 mph
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: nope, its non-image trust me.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: that crawler has wheels, an efficient form of movement
<The_Engineer> Bye everybody. I'm off to play
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and its still lower that someone walking
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: you're supposed to just have a photographic memory
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: your robot would need to lift its leg up off the ground inorder to move forward
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: not possible
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and you still have not addressed the cooling issues
<Dovah> Jageman: it walks, in military museum http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/WalkingMachine_USArmyTransportationMuseum_DSCN7543.JPG
<Jageman> Dovah: notice its not armored
<Dovah> Jageman: notice its a prototype in a museum....
<Jageman> Dovah: if it was armored like a tank, it would not move
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: the wide feet keep it from falling over when static, and when it begins walking, it leans to the side slightly shifting its center of gravity, thus allowing it to move the first foot. this is how walking works.
<Vivix> Isn't walking robots the worst idea ever?
<Vivix> Like- just about every method of movement would be more efficient?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: you are ignoring how much the legs would weigh
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: covered in armor
<Dovah> Vivix: walking is actually greatest form of movemnt, once you get past all the complications
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: the robot would have to lift them up inorder to move them
<Vivix> but those complication makes it horrible for machines, right?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02We talking about pony robots? o.o
<Punkie_Pue> lol yes
<Dovah> SuperBrony64: Sure, why not?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: no, its just difficult. When we master the art, we can send drones into areas even treaded vehicals cant go.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek poniez ^-^
<VenHur> Who knows what the future of the MLP franchise...
<XAX> SuperBrony64: ^_^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02VenHur: I do o-o
<Vivix> I don't think it would have any benefit, but I'm not an engineer
*thelonepony hugs SuperBrony64 :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02XAX: Moo :3
<thelonepony> Hi :3
*SuperBrony64 hugs thelonepony back :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ohai :3/
<thelonepony> how ya doin' :3
<AJIsAwesome> SB's a silleh filleh
<AJIsAwesome> :3
<stallion1> i dont think the flame will go out at season 3
<thelonepony> ayejay like uuuu~ :3
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: also, you could just trip the robot, i would love to see it come up with enough energy to get back up
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek silleh ouo
<Panda> Moo O_O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02o.o moo
<thelonepony> a wild Panda has appeared :O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica :D
<Dovah> Jageman: i'd like to see you stick your foot out and trip a 50 ton robot
<Panda> Sumica returns to us!
<Vivix> Doesn't mean it can't trip
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Someicka
<Panda> HALLELUUYA (or how ever its spelled)
<Sumica> 00,10System upgrade compleat
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Pondoo :3
<Panda> ...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica: Running Windows 8?
<Sumica> 00,10fuck nah
<Panda> please say no
<Jageman> Dovah: his robot has carbon nanotubes in the armor, carbon nanotube rope woudl do the trick
<Panda> ok good.
<Punkie_Pue> Im running 8 :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Throw your Windows 7 away, it's a piece of shit.
<Vivix> 8 Isn't bad
<Sumica> 00,10went from 4 gigs memory to 16
<Panda> O.o geez Sumica.
<Vivix> Welcome to the cluub Sumica
<GilDash> Didn't Microsoft's stock go down badly after the release of Win 8?
<Vivix> the sixteen giggers
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...but...
<Punkie_Pue> its okay. Im using it becuase the consumer preview is free until the february.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I only have 8 GB of memory O~O
<Dovah> Jageman: who is giving you this? carbon nanotubes cost $10k per millimeter.
<Panda> GilDash just like how nintendo will go down after the release of the wiiu??
<RainbowBash> :D
<Dovah> milligram*
<Jageman> Dovah: the military who would be fighting this thing
<XAX> SuperBrony64: Same ;_;
<Sumica> 00,10So I have this idea for a cross over.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Panda: ;-;
<Sumica> 00,10Deus ex and the Jetsons
<Dovah> Jageman: you mean you, as a tax payer.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: it isnt rendered useless once tripped. the main point is that I am wirelessly controlling it which defeats the need for several advanced proccesing functions. I can mimic the movements needed to get up, and the robot will follow.
<Panda> ^^ im kidding SB. I;m actually gonna be getting one :D
<Panda> Sumica O_o
<GilDash> Panda: Possibly. I personally can't see the attraction, but then I'm not the marke they're targeting.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02My Little Pony x Striperella
<Sumica> 00,10meet the jensons
<sub06905> Wii U~ im getting one also
<Jageman> Dovah: or i could barrow some left over from the nasa space elevator
<sub06905> :>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Panda: :D
<Vivix> But walking just sounds like-- extra effort for no gain
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: hydraulic muscles are far stronger than you think.
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: NO, SB. :I
<Kandarihu> Cyborgs made entirely of sprockets and cogs?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The small-hoofed mammal that is property of myself.
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, XD
<Buytoast> ha
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Buytoast> Stripperella
<sub06905> SuperBrony64, striperella?
<Dark92Enigma> SuperBrony64|Zzz: you watched Striperella? bet you watched BARB WIRE
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: you could never get enough energy out of the internal reactor to get it back up
<Buytoast> i remember that show
<Panda> SuperBrony64... but stripper ponies already exist :3
<Ryunosuke> SuperBrony64 brought up a point
<Panda> OI!
<CrystalPhoenix> Good gosh I really can't watch a video with Rina-chan vocing Rarity
<Panda> stripperella was an awesome show XD
<Ryunosuke> how do stripper ponies work? :)
<AJIsAwesome> ...
<Sumica> 00,10pony striping works the other way around
<Vivix> It sounds like soft-core porn
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Stripper ponies put on clothes
<Panda> Ryunosuke, should I show you?
<Sumica> 00,10they put on clothing
<Panda> xD
<VenHur> 3 Days 'till Wii U.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: too much weight
<thelonepony> Panda: oh u crazy animal :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02VenHur: Moo :3
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Possible Canterlot art from Almost a Year Ago!
<SpeccyRush>  
<VenHur> SuperBronyU: Moo.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Put it on!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: I guess my best arguement is that we are bored of wheels and have this nagging need to advance.
<Vivix> Walking is fun, and interesting, but kinda useless
<Vivix> It can be interesting in augmenting though, like the japanese have in elderly-home research
<RaveBrony> Oh god! I saw the look of the Wii U, dafuq is that thing?? Lmao
<DoctoDoctorWho> Advanc the science!
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: also, that crawler needs a special road to move on, regular roads and concreate could not handle the weight
<Vivix> sociological and health research > military research any day
<Dovah> Jageman: Look what the Japanese Children have.
<Dovah> http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/6/0/6/58606.jpg?v=1
<Dark92Enigma> SuperBrony64|Zzz: you never watched the movie BARB WIRE? it's pretty much the same as Striperella, but it's also a remake of CASABLANCA
<Dark92Enigma> a poor one, at best
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: your robot would sink into the ground with all the weight on two small feet
<Sumica> 00,10Vivix you talking about that exo suit frame that they made to help old people get around?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: and we care about the roads of countries we are invading?
<Vivix> Sumica, yeah, I thought it looked interesting
<Kandarihu> Dovah, it had to happen some time.
<Buytoast> With the Wii U, you can now e-mail your paychecks directly to Nintendo with the new Pay Us function.
<XAX> Buytoast: lel
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: your robot would sink into the ground
<Sumica> 00,10So what i heard they have to be ran at 10% output
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: increasing the nessesary power to move it around
<sub06905> dat Ponies47 :3
<Dovah> Kandarihu: Jageman is saying the robot wouldnt walk, tell me thats not proof robots are possible
<Sumica> 00,10cause at full output you could rip a bank door off it's hindges
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: the feet are wide so it doesnt sink, I think you are overplaying the weight just a bit
<AJIsAwesome> ohai, Ponies47. :)
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah I heard it's too strong at full power
<Ponies47> Hi AJIsAwesome :>
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: i don
<Buytoast> just imagine, old people rising up against the young, utilizing the power of machinery to overtake all who dare oppose them
<Buytoast> until they get a heart attack from all the fun
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: i don't think your comprehending how much that thing would weigh
<sub06905> wut :I
<Vivix> Flying Granny and her team of Mutant Geezers
<thelonepony> Hi Ponies47 :)
<Ponies47> Hi thelonepony :3
<thelonepony> :3
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: gravity is a bitch
*thelonepony noms on Ponies47 :3
<Dovah> good old general electrics
<Kandarihu> Dovah, there's something called the Square/Cube law that says that the larger the machine is, the power required to move it increases EXPONENTIALLY
<Dovah> http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/6/0/0/58600.jpg?v=1
<Ponies47> /).(\
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: anything that heavy would be too difficult to move
<Jageman> Dovah: something like that would work
<Jageman> Dovah: but scalled up
<Dovah> Jageman: It DOES work it already exists
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: the suit is built to fit the armor, not the other way around.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: its saying, "Come at me bro"
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: im just saying that a humanoid design is not the way to go
<Vivix> ^^
<SafariMonkey> Jageman: The style of humor reminds me of Monty Python, but much less OTT
<Buytoast> you some kind of anti human turrist?
*sub06905 throws pillows at Ponies47
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: lol
<Buytoast> without humans, there would be no oil! there would be no peace!
<Buytoast> there'd be no farms for food
*Ponies47 Catchs the pillows and throw them back at sub06905 1000 times harder "Think fast!"
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: also, a nonhumanoid shaped robot would have more space for internal power.
<sub06905> ah, pillows!
<Dark92Enigma> also +Phase4 what did Shizuka said? i can see she's asleep (schlafen*)
<Shizuka> 13wut
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Dark92Enigma> OMG
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<Shizuka> 13where have you been for the last... five hours
<Ponies47> O.O
<Phase4> 00,02and then Dark92Enigma confued everyone
<Dark92Enigma> grounded
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: any the weight will always be a problem
<Dovah> someone tell me this is not intimidating
<Dovah> http://ranqit.com/u/d743fa23-63ef-4dc6-9a6d-81c1d4eee081.jpg
<Vivix> It's not
<Dark92Enigma> dammit, i need to refresh :D
<AJIsAwesome> It's not intimidating. It's frightening.
<Vivix> Honestyl, as a design, I think it looks humorous, but personal preference aside
<Jageman> Dovah: it looks cool, does not mean its feasable
<Vivix> it's a unwise design choice for anything realistic
<SafariMonkey> DoctoDoctorWho: Where would energy that is converted to heat internally go? Wouldn't vents be a major weakness?
<Dovah> Jageman: Its real, and in japan
<Dovah> Jageman: its a "statue"
<Vivix> It's a statue
<Jageman> Dovah: you know what i mean
<Dovah> it can move its head and shoot non leathal lazers
<SafariMonkey> Dovah: A statue of a robot isn't a robot...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: assuming we do get it to work, can you imagine how scary that would be? You are a terrorist and the most advanced thing you've seen is the AK-47 you got 2 weeks ago. then you see this walk out.http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/mediawiki/images/thumb/c/c7/WarlordTitanicus.jpg/252px-WarlordTitanicus.jpg
<Vivix> moving head or not
<thelonepony> lawl, my computer crash :D
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: anything over 5 tons will be awesome but impractical
<Vivix> I just think giant two-legged robots look lame
<Ponies47> Huh and I was gonna tell Sumi about this video. I so slow ;_;
<Dovah> SafariMonkey: "statue" quotation marks are needed has it isnt a full statue, but not a full moveable robot either
<Vivix> like in Fallout3 I groaned and deleted it via console
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: tv tropes refrence?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: at least for bipedal movement
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: yes
<Vivix> A statue is a statue, moving parts or not
<CrystalPhoenix> I remember requesting that
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: Whoo tropers! /)
<Dovah> Vivix: statue is non moving
<CrystalPhoenix> and it got in top 10
<Vivix> A statue can move
<Vivix> look at modern art
<CrystalPhoenix> not first but it got in top 10
<Jageman> [\
<Dark92Enigma> so.....beautiful.....:(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is this that completed Children of the Night video?
<Russianbrony> Hold up. this about gundam? i'm doing a semester long paper on these.
<CrystalPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, no
<Jageman> males use the square brackets
<Sumica> 00,10no nitt
<DoctoDoctorWho> I see you got your hooves trimmed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<CrystalPhoenix> but the game used some technic he learned from the blog
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Same people, though.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: lol
*Ponies47 Noms on Nittany_Discord
<Sumica> 00,10nope
<CrystalPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, no once again
<Sumica> 00,10this is silly filly
<SafariMonkey> Dovah: OK maybe it's a robot of sorts, but I doubt it could be fitted to move under its own power in walk-like motions using the same level of technology it uses now, so that doesn't prove anything
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My bad.
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, the tactics of modern terrorists are not about presenting a show of force. Their strategy is about posing as innocent civilians and bringing shame on anyone who would go after them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Ponies47.
<Sumica> 00,10Crusaders is doing CoN
<Russianbrony> a gundam would take the equivalent of 7 apache engines to operate
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: also, remember, that starlight has not been commercalized yet
<Dovah> SafariMonkey: :| i just posted it cuz it looks cool....
<Ponies47> O.O
<Sumica> 00,10Science time
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and that any tech you get will be available to anyone else with enough resources
<CrystalPhoenix> Oh hot dang
<Ponies47> YAY! :D
<CrystalPhoenix> HIM
<AJIsAwesome> Science! :)
<Kandarihu> Then again, the islamists might prefer a giant robot during their 3rd phase.
<Vivix> http://www.qualitydigest.com/june06/Images/ARTICLES/3DMEASURE/3-D-Header.jpg now this is a cool robot
<thelonepony> i wub Science :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kandarihu: regardless of tactics anything that even resembles that link will instill hopelessness and unparralell fear
<Punkie_Pue> What doesn't this streamer have in is library?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, so how do i download planetside?
<Sumica> 00,10hoopla
<SafariMonkey> Dovah: I agree that it's awesome, but using it to prove that kind of point would be incorrect. But it's still awesome. :)
<AJIsAwesome> HOOPLA!
<Phase4> 00,02its been so long that i've forgotten how non steam games work
<Sumica> 00,10you go to the site and make a station account
<Jageman> random yay?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, done, its what triggered the password discussion
<Dovah> SafariMonkey: but dont worries in a few years japan will have it up and running :P
<Jageman> random yay again?
<Sumica> 00,10see on the right side of the home page for planet side
<Vivix> Jageman, streamer ping
<Phase4> 00,02Punkie_Pue, also that site where you rate password strengh? that kinda breaks password security, it requires you to give out your password :P
<Sumica> 00,10where you can input a beta code?
<Ponies47> Jageman, You must be new here
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, that robot looks top-heavy. It's probably immune to small-arms fire, but a few RPGs would knock that thing over.
<Vivix> ^^
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, done that, thats how i got to account creation
<Jageman> Ponies47: i is noob, ya
<Ryunosuke> isnt ps2 due out in... 5 days anyway? :)
<Dovah> http://www.myninjaplease.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/lw3.jpg
<Punkie_Pue> Phase4: I wouldn't enter my own password. Id enter password of simmilar strenghth
<Sumica> 00,10you should have been directed to a installer page
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kandarihu: the robot in the link?
<Sumica> 00,10check your email
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, yeah
<thelonepony> Ponies47: don't worry, he's cool :3
<Dovah> http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/ne/p/2004/NeoMecha2_500x667.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kandarihu: do you even know what that is?
<Punkie_Pue> Phase4: Im sure there is a way to use the site offline as well
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: also, just imaging all that weight when your robot inevitably falls over
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, I'm guessing it's from Warhammer 40K, right?
<Phase4> 00,02Punkie_Pue, it may be totaly legit, thing is it fundamentally against how passwords are suposed to work
<Vivix> Everything can be destroyed, and the more parts, the more oppertunities
<Ponies47> thelonepony, Seems like it. But he hasen't got my welcome yet :3
<SafariMonkey> OK I gotta go to bed. It's past midnight and I got school tomorrow (today :P)
<SafariMonkey> Bye!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kandarihu: yes
<thelonepony> Ponies47: he will soon get it :3
<Vivix> Bajbaj
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, SafariMonkey. :)
<thelonepony> Bye SafariMonkey :3
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: i don't care what you make it out of, the armor would take damage, not to metion the internal components
<Punkie_Pue> Phase4: That's true.
<SafariMonkey> Baj Vivix. Bye AJIsAwesome and thelonepony. :)
*AJIsAwesome hugs SafariMonkey goodbye :)
*thelonepony hugs SafariMonkey :3

<DoctoDoctorWho> CNT when wrapped around fabric has a -12% chance of deforming when struck, imagine it strung around a titanium matrix
<Jageman> get what?
<DoctoDoctorWho> yes I said -12%
*SafariMonkey hugs AJIsAwesome and thelonepony
<Dovah> http://www.myninjaplease.com/?p=3936
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i think it broke, says the code is already activated
*SafariMonkey reluctantly leaves hug to go to bed
<Vivix> so 78percent chance of deforming?
<Dovah> Mechs are already being built
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: i don't care what it is, everything breaks
<Phase4> 00,02"We're sorry, the Code you have entered has already been redeemed or has expired"
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: although it would be a tough nut to crack
<Vivix> And the more parts you have in something, the more likely it is to fail, anything mechy has too many parts to be a GOOD design in warfare or industry
<Punkie_Pue> Geneticly modified food sounds delicious
<Dovah> Jageman: Go break mt. everest.
<Sumica> 00,10skype Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02this is going to be one of those things where the game itself is fine but all the authentication around it makes it imposible
<Jageman> Dovah: easy
<Vivix> Dovah happens a littlebit everyday
<Jageman> Dovah: just need an astroid
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, that works too
<Sumica> 00,10you should already be in it if you used the key
<Dovah> Jageman: dont die in the process
<Sumica> 00,10if it bitches I still have 3 more codes
<Sumica> 00,10you can have another one
<Jageman> Dovah: still easy, just need a few smaller astroids
<Sumica> 00,10this coper wire, remionds me of a raceicst joke
<Vivix> I just think mech would be a horrible idea in anything except movies or shows- how much more money does it cost to amke it work compared to something more solid and structurally sound?
<Jageman> Dovah: everything breaks
<Dovah> Jageman: they will burn up in the atmosphere.
<Jageman> Dovah: nothing is permanant
<Dovah> Jageman: energy is
<Punkie_Pue> the stream interupting for you guys as well?
<Russianbrony> approx 725,000,000
<Sumica> 00,10hell of a machine
<Russianbrony> cost to build
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: back to previous points, nothing is indestructable. the laws of physics say anything can be destroyed if you hit it hard enough(this is known as the "Ork effect"). Im simply stating that it is so durable that modern human weaponry cannot penetrate it.
<Jageman> Dovah: a bus sized astroid would burn up in the atmosphere?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: its own humanoid design would work against it
<Vivix> ^
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: you would have to abandon that
<Dovah> Jageman: burn up and shatter into too small pieces to be big enought to truly destroy the mountain.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anyone else getting intermittent buffer?
<Phase4> 00,02XD i was extracting a copy of the serenity and firefly soundtracks, it warned me that the timestamps are in the future
<VenHur> This machinery is BEAST!
<Dovah> Nittany_Discord: yeah.
<VenHur> It's madness! It's...IT!
<Punkie_Pue> Nittany_Discord: Yes
<DoctoDoctorWho> we have designed robots that get up when knocked over, on their own.
<Dark92Enigma> yes
<Jageman> Dovah: have you seen meteor crater
<thelonepony> Night: a bit
<Dovah> Jageman: yes
<Vivix> robots are made to be efficient, so often they're made to be smaller and faster, not bigger
<Sumica> 00,10.......that seems deadly
<Punkie_Pue> lol
<Jageman> Dovah: a few of them would do the trick
<Vivix> one of hte best walker designs is good because it is small, light and fast
<Dovah> Jageman: everest is much bigger and the trejectory of astroids are unpredictible to say the least
<Jageman> Dovah: im not saying it would be easy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: plus, titanium is lighter than steel, covering it in carbon nanotubes would be like putting on a light jacket
<Sumica> 00,10supprise Shizuka is't speaking up yet
<SpeccyRush> sumi mips might be acting up
<RainbowPie> Im back :)
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmm?
<Sumica> 00,10how so?
<Dovah> Jageman: [18:08:08] <Jageman> Dovah: easy
<thelonepony> wb RainbowPie :)
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: i think your looking past critical problems because you just want a giant walking robot
<Vivix> titanium is weaker than steel though, isn't it? Just not in weight comparison?
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, RainbowPie. :)
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, GilDash! :)
<thelonepony> Night GilDash :)
<Vivix> Dovah, that's a silly argument, don't backtrack on a sidetrack
<Jageman> Dovah: that was before it had to be servivable
<RainbowBash> Gnight GilDash
<SpeccyRush> Sumica: just intermitant buffer for some if you'll look up abit
<RainbowPie> :) Is anypony here good with names? I need a little help
<AttackWithHugs> Night, GilDash
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: titanium is renowned for being not only lighter than steel, but stronger as well
<RainbowPie> night GilDash
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it's cause i sent Phase4 a file
<Vivix> I've heard the opposite, but I'm not an engineer so I don't know
*Vivix wiki's
<DoctoDoctorWho> Its 20% cooler than steel
<Russianbrony> the best would be a titanium alloy, not straight up titanium.
<Dovah> Jageman: an 18 ft walking humanoid robat with a flamethrower has already been built in '05 of course its cant move very far and it shuffles more than walks but still.
<DoctoDoctorWho> something like the russian said
<Sumica> 00,10I restarted it
<Vivix> titanium is as strong as some steels, but 45% lighter
<Vivix> it's not stronger
<Punkie_Pue> Deja Vu
<Jageman> Dovah: and 1 rpg would killl it
<[Alpha]> I like this show
<Vivix> It probably cost so much with so little yield that the army laughed at it
<Jageman> Dovah: also, no internal power sourse
<Dovah> Jageman: Kinda missing the point of this here robot.
<Dovah> Jageman: yes it has internal power.
<[Alpha]> hmm I hate my laptop
<Jageman> Dovah: any robot that could walk would be easily destroyed, any robot strong enough would be too heavy
<Sumica> 00,10kinda amazing how much work is still done by hand
<Russianbrony> Building this thing is what i plan on doing with my life.
<XAX> What on earth is being made here?
<DoctoDoctorWho> straight from wikipedia, The two most useful properties of the metal form are corrosion resistance and the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal.[5] In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but 45% lighter
<Jageman> Dovah: the math is not there
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho, yeah, I just pasted excerpt of that
<Phase4> 00,02ye gods how big is planetside
<Punkie_Pue> Sumica: Look up how a rolls royce is made
<Vivix> It is as (equally) strong as some(not all) steels
<Sumica> 00,10that's a diffrent story Punkie_Pue
<XAX> Phase4: 6.6gb.
<Sumica> 00,10they choose to make it by hand
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, i've got 15GB free space and its complaining at me to free up another 1G
<Sumica> 00,10i was refering to some jobs that cant be done by machine
<SpeccyRush> Phase4: it is called "planetside"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: I think you are being unreasonable in that you are stating there is no solution
<Punkie_Pue> Sumica: thats ture.
<XAX> Phase4: •_•
<Phase4> 00,02SpeccyRush, true
<Sumica> 00,10it needs room to uncompress data
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: not that there is not solution
<Vivix> As Jageman I think it is unreasonable, a bad idea, but possible
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: I am attempting to think this through as well as I can
<Russianbrony> bigger problem than being destroyed; how's it gonna walk without destroying the ground under it?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: there is currently no solution
<Dovah> Jageman: You seem to like to look past the fact that technology is advancing at a rate so fast its very plausable we will have warp capabilities by the year 2300
<[Alpha]> What is being made?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, ... its 2012, i can decompress things progressively with tools written in the 80s, this is unreasonable
<Jageman> Dovah: i can see that
<Vivix> We said the same about moonbases in in 1969
<Phase4> 00,02but whatever, i'll find a spare gigabyte somwhere
<Jageman> Dovah: but not right now
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: by 2030-2050 we could do this
<Sumica> 00,10all karge envioment games do that still
<Vivix> I don't think we will ever see mechs in use
<Vivix> ever-
<Sumica> 00,10wow takes 40 gigs to install but only uses 20 gigs on disk
<Vivix> but, I've been wrong before
<SafariMonkey> Dovah it could be sooner...
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: i don't think so, not without some major breakthroughs
<Dovah> Jageman: so what is so hard to believe about a funtional walking humanoid robot used in the military much sooner?
<Phase4> 00,02wish they would stop doing that
<Phase4> 00,02its incredibly anoying and even more lazy
<Sumica> 00,10aye me too
<Punkie_Pue> I think blops 2 wanted 24 gigs free 8 to download 8 to uncompress and 8 for the game
<Russianbrony> I plan on making those breakthroughs.
<Kinixys> The deadlier weapons are smaller, faster, and simpler.
<Vivix> Dovah it is a horrible design, absolutely horrible, just about every other military design would be better
<Phase4> 00,02plus its gona cause disk fragmentation like theres no tomorow
<Jageman> Dovah: power requirements and weight issues
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Sumica> 00,10tis why I run defraggler alot
<Phase4> 00,02urgh, i'll just disable the hiberfile
<Phase4> 00,02biggest single file on windows anyway
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: some guys thought tanks would never be feasable. I belive the germans ran their asses over first chance they got.
<Vivix> My computer defrags automatically-
<OtakuTom> Wow...How it's Made? I love this show XD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> How Scoot's Made
<Vivix> I never heard anyone say that, a better analogy would be aeroplanes
<Jageman> Dovah: however, if ther was a breakthrough in nanotech, it might happen much sunner
<Sumica> 00,10I dont like auto functions cause my sleep schudle
<Jageman> Dovah: sooner
<Vivix> Tanks aren't a good design anymore, in modern wars
<Vivix> but it was in big wars
<Dovah> Jageman: fine, skip out on a giant robot, large exoskeletons exist, they can move realitvly fast and offer some protection from small arms fire
<XAX> Sumica: I haven't ran defrag in the 10 months I've had my computer...
<Vivix> The only exoskeleton I know banned military from looking at it
<Sumica> 00,10I could not run it till I got defraggler
<Sumica> 00,10somthing kept restarting the windows one
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: we could build tanks before the world wars, we just didnt have the tech to make it work. same thing here.
<Jageman> Dovah: i can see that in about 20 years
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho, but here, it's not just the tech, but the idea itself that is bad
<Dovah> brb all
<DoctoDoctorWho> bai Dovah
<Vivix> Spend extra resources, extre time, extra skill and complication solving, on somethign that would give worse results than a practical, smaller design
<Phase4> 00,02there we go, 16GB of space instafreed
<Jageman> Dovah: and have it connected to your nervous system in 30
<Sumica> 00,10just because the desgine is bad dont meen it wont end up on the battle field
<Sumica> 00,10just look at the bradily fighting vheical
<Vivix> No- but I think it's unlikely, because of money and engineering
<Russianbrony> giant robots would work better in space, where 4 limbs are more practical for orientation and weight is no issue. too bad no space wars exist
<Vivix> that's a good thing in my book
<Sumica> 00,10nice montoage here
<Kinixys> Russianbrony: Why stop at four limbs?
<Vivix> A world without wars or armies would be a better world, sadly, not possible as it is
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: walking vehicals are the most useful type of transport there is, its just horrificly difficult
<[Alpha]> I was on facebook and I forgot I was still on here
<[Alpha]> :P
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho, I don't think that's true, if it were- we would use that on mars now wouldn't we?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: wrong, flying is
<Zippoman924> So what is this?
<Vivix> the best spacedesign is apparently a box
<Phase4> 00,02for those who wernt here before, http://xkcd.com/936/ how password security actually works
<Vivix> though- that might be a joke
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: Impossible. humans are a naturally warlike species. we make klingons look like peace advocates
<Vivix> I never want to build something that would use passwords- too much responsobility
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho, sadly, yes
<Vivix> I'm not a cynic though
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: im going to research that warp drive
<SafariMonkey> Jageman flying vehicles have their own set of problems, but useful I'd agree
<Zippoman924> ok it is how it's hade cool
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: too much energy expended in staying still, and aerial balance is a bitch
<Phase4> 00,02DoctoDoctorWho, walking is a hideously complicated process, we just make it look easy. for raw locomotion wheels are better but limbs are more adaptable to arbitry terrain
<OtakuTom> lol...I've actually used "correcthorsebatterystaple" as a password (briefly) for one of my programs XD
<Sumica> 00,10wrong ep
<Russianbrony> FUCK YEAH
<SafariMonkey> And it looks interesting doesn't it Jageman?
<Russianbrony> GUNDAM all the way
<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase4: yes
<Kinixys> I want box shaped gundams.... XD
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: not if you use an ionic engine
<Kinixys> jking of course.
<[Alpha]> cool eyed
<Phase4> 00,02Jageman, ion drives consume insane amounts of power
<Phase4> 00,02and produce bugger all thrust
<DoctoDoctorWho> wait, box shaped ships best for space... fuckin borg
<Punkie_Pue> Is it wise to use dictionary words for a password?
<Vivix> dun dun duun
<CrystalPhoenix> Phase4, basciallt just put as much character as you can?
<Sumica> 00,10why do you think the borg used cubes
<Punkie_Pue> Is it wise to use dictionary words in password?
<Vivix> I use multilangue and made up words sentences as passwords
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: a florida professor discovered a way to make an engine that ionises the air and uses it for propusion
<SafariMonkey> Punkie_Pue if you use enough
<Phase4> 00,02CrystalPhoenix, yes and no, number of characters != entropy and thats whats actually important
<Punkie_Pue> Did i spam that? it wasn't showing up in chat
<Jageman> Phase4: i was not talking about radioionic engines
<Kinixys> Punkie_Pue: Use about 20 or more random words, sure.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: I know about Ion engins, I know about lots of theoretical tech
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im preparing for the future
<Sumica> 00,10all this talk of passwords is making me want to play uplink
<Jageman> Phase4: those only work well in a vacuum
<[Alpha]> I have not watched this before so not sure what's gping on
<SafariMonkey> Punkie_Pue http://xkcd.com/936/
<[Alpha]> going
<Vivix> Sadly, I don't- I'm far mor interested in animals and such than tech
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: its not theoretical, he made a working prototype
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: it was just small
<Zippoman924> Anime nice never heard of this one though but I haven't heard of many anyways.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: theoretical, near future, I excel in all
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and it burnned through the battery too quickly
<Vivix> titanium have ultimate tensile strength of about 63,000 psi (434 MPa), equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys,
<DoctoDoctorWho> not to brag or anything...
<Vivix> common, low grade steel alloy
<XxNightHawk64xX> on a scale of 1-10 what would crystal empire both parts be
<AttackWithHugs> Hmm...be back soon guys. Gonna try out this LiveCD I just burnt.
<AttackWithHugs> You stay classy, BronyState.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: working prototype
<Kinixys> XxNightHawk64xX: 7
<SafariMonkey> Jageman I gotta stop doing this, going to bed and carrying on on my mobile
<Vivix> 7.5 in my opinion XxNightHawk64xX
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: can we make starfleets yet?
<Sumica> 00,10dat pinkie VA
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: k bte
<Punkie_Pue> That the same voice actresS?
<Jageman> SafariMonkey: bye*
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: no
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: near future
<thelonepony> XxNightHawk64xX: 7.6 in my opinion :3
<SafariMonkey> Bye
<Zippoman924> that girl in the elivator looking thing that was pinkie
<DoctoDoctorWho> gtg, see yall bronystate
<Sumica> 00,10the one with the twin drill hair is the same VA as pinkie
<Russianbrony> my life is complete
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: they would only carry weights under a pound right now
<Zippoman924> cool
<Phase4> 00,02CrystalPhoenix, if that were 25 random characters it'd have an entropy of ~ 118 bits, but its much easier to remember words
<CrystalPhoenix> You can just say Andrea you know
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: but darpa wants them for building hovering lightweight robots
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but I never remember the names
<Valvad> What is this?
<Phase4> 00,02118 bits would take longer than the universe has existed to brute force, your average ssl connection has a 128 bit key, an rsa key is betwene 1024 and 4096 bits in size (actual entropy is less but still large)
<CrystalPhoenix> http://www.derpibooru.org/153339
<[Alpha]> Yeah names aren't my strongpoint either >.>
<Punkie_Pue> If one uses dictionary words, how much does that weaken it?
<Valvad> Whats playing?
<[Alpha]> xD that Crash bandicoot
<Shizuka> 13significantly
<Kinixys> CrystalPhoenix: One way is to use the first leter from each word of a custom, easy-to-remember phrase.
<Phase4> 00,02Punkie_Pue, thats what the xkcd system is, it still has 44 bits of entropy though
<Punkie_Pue> I would think of using a mnemonic device to come up with what seems like a random password
<Zippoman924> What are you talking about?
<Punkie_Pue> passwords
<Zippoman924> oh
<Phase4> 00,0244 bits is enough to be safe unless the password hashes are stolen, even then you're still looking at a fair ammount of time to crack
<Bobeh> Hey guys. Hey guys listen. My na'es Chef Vordivask now. Alright cool? Alright cool.
<CrystalPhoenix> http://www.derpibooru.org/153336 STAIRS Twilight's worse enemy
<Bobeh> *name's
<Jageman> im leaving for a while, later all.
<Phase4> 00,02enough time to find out about the breach and change your passwords
<Phase4> 00,02later Jageman
<Kinixys> Bye jage..
<Phase4> 00,02Kinixys, too slow :P
<Kinixys> No problem. I'll say bye next time I see em.
<Vivix> So- passwords are stored and checked like a checksum?
<Kinixys> Wait... no... oh well.
<Chef_Vordivask> I TOLD you guys that my name is now Chef Vordivask. And you didn't believe me.
<Valvad> I just got here whats playing?
<[Alpha]> CrystalPhoenix: xD those pictures
<Valvad> Oh Gundum
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, cryptographic hash
<Valvad> Why is it not in English Sub?
<Vivix> Ah nice
<Punkie_Pue> CrystalPhoenix: :)
<Vivix> I've seen sites use cleartext--horrible
<Russianbrony> 7 battles.... sure thats invincible...
<FireStarter> What Are We Watching Gundam?
<Rainbow_Dash_Fan_Boy> sup
<Valvad> Oh god the English dubs are soo bad T.T
<Rainbow_Dash_Fan_Boy> what anime is this
<Vivix> Apparently- if I want to study zoology, I have to go 3 years of Biology
<Dark92Enigma> Chef_Vordivask I told you i'd shoot! BUT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME! WHY YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME!
<Phase4> 00,02a checksum has to be deterministic, cryptographic hash needs to be deterministic, exibit the avalanch effect, destroy input information and be reletively expencive to compute
<Vivix> I think biology is gross-
<Russianbrony> what is name of character with Pinkie VA?
<Sumica> 00,10useing subs because it makes it easyer for people to chat and watch show
<Phase4> 00,02and not exibit colisions
<Dark92Enigma> Rainbow_Dash_Fan_Boy: Gundam 00
<AJIsAwesome> Andrea Libman, Russianbrony. :)
<Vivix> Phase4, makes sense- I've tested my main passwords on aah "how long would it take to bruteforce my password"
<Vivix> but- no idea how accurate those are, but- better than not knowing I guess
<Kinixys> Vivix: Bacteria.. virii.. ect?
<Phase4> 00,02they're terribly inacurate usually
<Vivix> Kinixys, I don't like dead things ;__; I'm afraid biology will go into that
<Phase4> 00,02if someone gets your password hash assume its compromisde
<Phase4> 00,02comprimised
<Phase4> 00,02'
<Dark92Enigma> Russianbrony: try an entire season, and then we can call him invincible
<Vivix> yeah
<Zippoman924> ok well I'm going to go play some Assassins Creed 3 now. Bye everyone
<Vivix> I mean, when a site tells me "We've bee compromised" I change all my password sets, despite using different passwords pretty much everywhere
<Sumica> 00,10the one in lavender is a guy btw
<Russianbrony> I swear to you all, I will do everything in my power to make a real gundam. Then I will paint it pink and put balloon decals on its ass.
<Vivix> Ha'
<Vivix> That would be worth seeing
<[Alpha]> I would personally like to shake your hand when that happens
<Kinixys> Russianbrony: You'll have to make it dance.
<Vivix> Norwegian zoological association website. "What is zoologi?" directs you to a page that says "What"
<Russianbrony> will do.
<Dark92Enigma> TA DA! Kiss me!
<[Alpha]> O.o
<CrystalPhoenix> cross-dressing?
<Kinixys> Some place more quiet?
<Dovah> yay! gundam!
<Russianbrony> I have to pee, but i'm not leaving my computer.

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im like… what???
<AJIsAwesome> I well naht, tehlonpon. :<
<Phase4> 00,02i just *buffer*

<AJIsAwesome> Don't u doo taht, tehlonpon. ;~;
<flutter_spin> These names! I can't keep up.
<Mihoshika> I don't recall any show having a better dub over the sub, with a few exceptions.
<AJIsAwesome> I'll mess u. ;3;
<thelonepony> i'll mess u two ;3;
<AJIsAwesome> So don't. ;_;
<Kencolt> Gubdam shows almost always have a better then average dub.
<Dovah> is neon genesis evangelion a good series?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Sumica> 00,10gits, bebop imeadatly come to mind as good
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Dancer
<flutter_spin> lol... Gubwhat?
<Kencolt> Dovah: Depends on your tolerance for WTF and a damn near lack of any likable characters.
<thelonepony> but, i hert u ayejay ;3;
<Sumica> 00,10alot of it depends on the company doing the dubs
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, it's more of a psycological anime than anything else.
<AJIsAwesome> WIth action.
<Mihoshika> Psychological anime...
<Dovah> Kencolt: my tolerance of wtf is unfathomably high.
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: Then I think you'd be okay watching it.
<Mihoshika> I think Serial Experiments Lain fits best into that genre
<Kencolt> Lain always made perfect sense to me.
<AJIsAwesome> Taht doesn't meen I don't 4give people, tehlonpon. :<
<Sumica> 00,10I think that guys jimmies just got rusted

<[Alpha]> 3 second rule...xD
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> O...

<Vordox> this...
<Saturn> 08,01as expected, perfect solution in about 1 - 2 minutes

<CrystalPhoenix> Can you curry in C
<flutter_spin> Mai finally got the joke Sumica said yesterday
<CrystalPhoenix> Can you Currency
<Saturn> 08,01no, it wasn't a pun
<CrystalPhoenix> I saw it as one then
<Bacon[Hazard]> Why is it a problem to have a piece of string in your hair? It could be understood as a fashion statement.
<Sumica> 00,10those are the best puns
<flutter_spin> Go Fluttershy!
<Vordox> Bacon[Hazard]: You're too straight!
<Vordox> <--- Goat?
<Vordox> HAH
<Vordox> Yeah like..
<Saturn> 08,01currying is basically taking a partial application of a function
<Bacon[Hazard]> I'm so straight!
<flutter_spin> goatman!
<Bacon[Hazard]> I can't sit down!
<Vordox> Betsuni
<Saturn> 08,01so, say i have a function: bool isMult(int a, int b)

<flutter_spin> WUT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i like spicy curry

<Vordox> She's weak at english

<Bacon[Hazard]> I will get one for the soul purpose of killing and eating it.
<flutter_spin> lol
<Deacon> y-you too....
<Saturn> 08,01and that new function will return if a is a multple of 3 or not
<Bacon[Hazard]> "I did!"

*Saturn 08,01is a massive functional nut, if you coudln't guess
<flutter_spin> I don't get it.
<Bacon[Hazard]> PLOT TWIST!
<Vordox> flutter_spin: Translation Error :P
<the_real_pony_1604> it is a bad translation. it was "clueless" not KY
<PotatoFriendly> Having troble reading chat and subtitles at the same time.
<Sumica> 00,10just smile and nod at Saturn till he goes away, unless he's drunk then he will think you are coming on to him
<Saturn> 08,01what are you guys watching?
<PotatoFriendly> I don't know

<OtakuTom> I've broken my toe by stubbing it on furninture and walls
<Deacon> not the little toe!
*superretroworld gets Sumica some ice

<flutter_spin> SAME SAME
<Vordox> Saturn: THAT'S TOO WEIRD for you!?
<Vordox> WHAt?!
<Punkie_Pue> I feel this anime raises more questions than it answers.
<PotatoFriendly> Only in japan. I'm going.
<OtakuTom> Actually, I'd say that Saturn was at least somewhat close. They're both based on popular 4-panel comics, and follow a very similar animation style and episode format.
<Vordox> Punkie_Pue: Just wait. This is just introductions XD
<Bacon[Hazard]> Toe Missiles; only in Japan.
<flutter_spin> Wait, robots can't go to school?
<Vordox> OtakuTom: But humour wise, storywise and character wise. :P
<Punkie_Pue> Challenge accepted
<Punkie_Pue> Did it just start?

<AJIsAwesome> ^ Bacon[Hazard]
<CriticKitten> This is very confusing.
<AJIsAwesome> Not for me. :D
<thelonepony> what ayejay said :U
<Bacon[Hazard]> Those who understand have already seen it or are Pinkie Pie.
<Kandarihu> I would've watched Angel Beats if I had caught the beginning when I could have audio, too
<CriticKitten> I'd claim the show's creator was on drugs, but I've seen FLCL, so I know better
<HoodyNinja> You guys like random anime? http://anime-direct.com/snaps/Gintama.jpg
<Bacon[Hazard]> Or Shizuka. Or Sumica.
<RDash5000> everything makes sense if you throw logic out the window :)
<AJIsAwesome> YES
<otakon> CriticKitten: now THAT show was AWESOME!
<AJIsAwesome> I love Gin Tama. :D
<otakon> RDash5000: like Gurren Lagann!
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome: I love you
<SpikeIsThe7thElement> shes gunna write on it
<the_real_pony_1604> thinking we need to have a stream of Samurai Champloo at some point
<conami> is there such thing as a casual brony? cause im one :P
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: I'm not ready for that kind of commitment as of now.....
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps some excel saga?
<otakon> the_real_pony_1604: I think we have
<otakon> Sumica: YES
<RDash5000> yes. killer...
<AJIsAwesome> Sure, Sumi.
*HoodyNinja friendzoned
<haseo348> wha i missed?
<CriticKitten> Needs more guitar.
<otakon> Sumica: ALL OF MY YES! maybe Puni Puni Poemi? it's shorter by far so easier to see the whole thing
<RDash5000> HoodyNinja: ponyzoned
<thelonepony> HoodyNinja: i know that feel ;3;
<HoodyNinja> RDash5000: OGOD NO
<SpikeIsThe7thElement> cat is gunna get run overed thee end
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: :3
<CriticKitten> Preferably in the form of guitar to the face
<otakon> Sumica: You wouldn't happen to have Dragon Half would you?
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, FLCL was created by Gainax as a holiday from Evangelion. I wouldn't consider that show a drug trip. Maybe Dead Leaves was done under the influence, though.
<HoodyNinja> I hate my stream~
<the_real_pony_1604> Welcome to the NHK?
*RDash5000 is new to anime. please don't hurt him.
<CriticKitten> .....broccoli in bag
<CriticKitten> Sure why not
<Bacon[Hazard]> "Don't do drugs, kids."
<Kencolt> otakon: I'm not sure about that one. When an anime is marked saying, "IF we haven't offended you, we're not doing our job" is in question...
<haseo348> lol...
<AJIsAwesome> Ew, broccoli. :I
<HoodyNinja> Inb4 she a ghost
<otakon> Kencolt: still funny and weird as hell
<HoodyNinja> Broccoli is good
<SkunkTari> i love broccoli :P
*thelonepony feeds AJIsAwesome broccoli :I
<Kandarihu> the_real_pony_1604, from what I understand about that series, it's not the kind of thing I'd want to see on the stream.
<AJIsAwesome> D:
<Bacon[Hazard]> "And it's good FOR you!"
<Canadian_Brony> conami ehh, depends on your defenition. I see them as someone who enjoys the show and has little engagement in the fandom. IOW a guy like the show and says "That's my story and I'm sticking to it."
<haseo348> broccoli and cheese is better
<AJIsAwesome> But I don't like broccoli, tehlonpon. ;~;
<thelonepony> haseo348: it makes you fat with that combo :U
<CriticKitten> I've already accepted that a teenage girl is armed with military hardware, so a girl carrying broccoli stalks around with her doesn't make a blip on the radar anymore
<otakon> RDash5000: welp welcome to it, hope you find something that tickles your fancy bc there are ALL KINDS
<haseo348> thelonepony: lol still good...
<RDash5000> otakon: i will tread carefully
<thelonepony> but you must eat it ayejay :I

<RDash5000> otakon: i remember watching one i can't remember the name of that i loved, and i recently started on called sakura cardcaptor
<Kandarihu> Yeah, I think we can write off the theory that this series was done under influence of mind-altering substances.
<haseo348> LOL

<Mega_Milk> red head.....
<Mega_Milk> awesome clothes...
<Cypresswolf> :) with an ep title like that, I have high expectations for shenanigans
<Mega_Milk> looks like she could be pretty bad ass with a shotgun....
<Mega_Milk> Shizu stream..
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: Wait....is it not showing the correct image? It is for me
<Buytoast> it's showing a teenage mutant ninja turtle covered in shit
<Sumica> 00,10no clue what I am doing
<Buytoast> and a cow's butthole right next to it
<Kurra> Eww that image
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast:....I forgot
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: That site doesn't allow hotlinking
<Eddmario> You know what someone should stream here? Some classic Abbot and Costello
<Big_Macintosh_1992> I'm not on often, buy if anyone wants to add me on steam: mkmasterscorpion
<Big_Macintosh_1992> *but
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: But for some reason I'm getting the correct image I wanted to post instead of the no-hotlinking image
<Buytoast> cow needs more fiber or something
<VenHur> And more DCD. :'(
<Kurra> moving on...
<Eddmario> So, my dad bought my brother BLOPSII today...
<thelonepony> Eddmario: was he happy?
<Mega_Milk> Eddmario: Im so sorry...
<J_E_Smith71> Okay sorry guys for that picture, forgot about that hotlink protection image
<thelonepony> or to much energy
<superretroworld> well i got 14 kills in tf2 today, which is actually a world record for me
<Kurra> that site should be sorry, J_E_Smith71
<Eddmario> Mega_Milk: Thanks, but it doesn't help that I'll have to hear him going "OMG YOU FUCKING DOUCHEBAG!" every few seconds...
<Kurra> but anyway
<J_E_Smith71> Oddly enough I'm getting the correct image I wanted to show. Don't know why it works for me and not you guys
<thelonepony> Eddmario: kids these days with those words /)_-
<Eddmario> But seriously, we should get some Abbot and Costello on here sometime...
<Eddmario> Since I don't recognize the HUD, I'm assuming this is a GTA game...
<VenHur> And more DCD!
<Eddmario> Or one of the first 2 Saints Row games...
<doctorwhoovesNLR> see ya everypony i've got a date with my bed

<pony_numbers> yes
<Kandarihu> Well, any landing you can walk away from is a good landing
<thelonepony> Because,
<Jageman> Although little is truly known about brony behaviour, it would be logical to assume that scrapping is in some way related to choosing fit members of the speicies to mate with.
<Canadian_Brony> ha, sub06905 was deaded

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Jageman: ........

<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy there's a glitch in this game where you drive into a swingset and it flings you across the city while impossibly wrecking your car. Then, no matter how fucked up your car is, you can drive it like it's good as new.

<superretroworld> Rockstar said that if they release a new gta4 game every year, the fans would lose interest
<Jageman> that swing set has some bounce to it.
<pony_numbers> put your can in the air
<Sarah_B> it's no less "too far" than shooting a mother or a 60 year old helpless person lol

<Jageman> Sarah_B: because of a glitch
<twilight_sprinkle> Sarah_B: its glitched so that it can send you flying through the city
<AppleBloom> superretroworld: ahh well shucks
<Sarah_B> i see
<pony_numbers> your computer too slowly
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl your computer IS TOO SLOOOOW
<superretroworld> AppleBloom: :)
<shizumobile> And this is asuka remember
<Canadian_Brony> Sarah_B it's a glitch. You run into it and it flings you into the air. It also wrecks your car to the point where it should be utterly impossible to drive, but if you land wheels-down, you can drive it.
<thelonepony> sprunkls, like urs :U
<Sarah_B> oh niiiice
<twilight_sprinkle> ;~;
<SpeccyRush> shizumobile: ya know that technically means if it didn't lag out you woulda been flying so far

<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: hell you can even use messletters
<Sarah_B> when I see ponies I g.ak all over the room and my pants

<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: after 3 kicks in 1 or two mins or so

<J_E_Smith71> Sarah_B: Yeah I see now, but someone else said "This is not 4chan, please act appropriately before a mod steps in." That person thought you were being dirty with that statement

<pony_7777> i saw it in a commercial
<[Alpha]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMqWJSQ1Ot8
<pony_1987> aw oh NocturnalBlade
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Technically, we shouldn't be talking about the new episode. We're not allowed to. :)
<[Alpha]> That commercial was creepy
<Wrek> 05pony_7777: well if thats true, then why the fuck are you sayign it in a chatroom with a zero tolerance to spoilers? tsk tsk
<[Alpha]> smile?
<HoodyNinja> I don't think that was necessary...
<Wrek> 05too bad
<[Alpha]> Well stff happens
<[Alpha]> stuff
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ponies really need to read our rules...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<Wrek> 05sometiems i wish i wasnt a mod
<Wrek> 05that way i wouldnt have to read spoilers to ban for spoilers
<[Alpha]> wait you have to do that?
<HoodyNinja> He doesn't, but I don't think he thought it through
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Well...how else are we going to know if they're spoilers unless we prove they are?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02'Pinkie Pie is best pony!'
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Even joke spoilers aren't allowed.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Time to do some research on this....
<[Alpha]> aww man i'm sorry
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I don't even like joke spoilers.
<Wrek> 05if you say somethign that may be a sppoiler
<HoodyNinja> The funniest joke spoilers are the ones that turn out to be true
<Wrek> 05and you dont say it in a "i think" matter
<Wrek> 05then you just screwed yourself over
<HoodyNinja> Even then its not that funny
<[Alpha]> Wow
<[Alpha]> Good thing I don't come here that often
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Appealing is still possible, right Wrek?
<Wrek> 05always
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ok.
<Wrek> 05but dont think I look kindly on scrub spoilign it for otehr people
<J_E_Smith71> Hey Wrek, is even saying which character the episode will focus on and nothing else count as spoiling?
<Wrek> 05in my eyes, Tom shouldnt even say the episode names casue that is a spoiler
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I can understand that.
<HoodyNinja> What is the name of this ep :P
<HoodyNinja> !cd
<Tom> Episode 3 of season 3 "Too Many Pinkie Pies" airs in 1 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes, 51 seconds (Nov 17 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<HoodyNinja> Oh
<HoodyNinja> :I
<Wrek> 05see?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yeah, the title practically gives it away.
<HoodyNinja> I have no idea what this could be about
<HoodyNinja> >_>
<[Alpha]> Darn you are right taht spoiled it
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Unfortunately.
<[Alpha]> thst
<[Alpha]> that
<[Alpha]> geez I can't type today
<J_E_Smith71> Wrek: Is it even not safe to say something tame like "This next episode's a Pinkie episode" or "Next episode's going to about CMC" and nothing else?
<Wrek> 05I suppose those would be alright
<HoodyNinja> I would think not, but assume so
<Wrek> 05but if i was in charge id not look kindly on it
<[Alpha]> Geez one of the meme websites spoiled it for me already but hey you are bound to run in to some spoilers here and there. It is the internet
<Wrek> 05pfft
<Wrek> 05i kept completly clean for season 2
<Wrek> 05season 3 2 things are spoiled for me
<Rain> If you see a bully beating a kid to death on a playground and dont try to stop them, you might as well have been beating the kid yourself.
<Rain> debate this ^
<Wrek> 05theres nothign to debate
<Wrek> 05its obvious
<HoodyNinja> Rain: Its a conspiracy
<Wrek> 05that bully needs an axe to the balls
<Shizuka> 13^
<HoodyNinja> You're being framed
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^^
<[Alpha]> Best answer ever
<HoodyNinja> Not an effective way of killing someone, but painful enough
<[Alpha]> xD
<Rain> Thank you very much, Wrek and Shizuka
<HoodyNinja> I woulda just hit him with a big rock
*Shizuka 13gives rain rain a warm blanket and a cookie :)
<HoodyNinja> Where are you gonna get an axe at a school?
<Shizuka> 13wrek's answer to everything is axe, it works :3
<Wrek> 05HoodyNinja: i alwasy cary one around
<J_E_Smith71> Wrek: Do you even try to look away from the next episode ads too?(Personally doesn't like the fact that the Hub is spoiling things that would have been good suprises)
<[Alpha]> Or you could string them up in a tree by their balls
<Wrek> 05J_E_Smith71 i dont watch the live eps
<Wrek> 05i wait for a youtube version withotu commercials
<Wrek> 05doesnt mean i dont mod chat

<Rain> I hope you remember your answer on the 20th.

<Wrek> 05there'd be world peace
<[Alpha]> Yes the best thing ever. I got kicked but it was worth it to know
<Rain> Raising awareness is the least you can do to stop the murderous bullies.
<HoodyNinja> Everyone would need a security gaurds
<Wrek> 05casue there wouldnt be idiots provoking me/us
<HoodyNinja> Everyone would be fighting, too.

<Java> Yep
<AJIsAwesome> Wow.
<aniderp> i live in usa east coast
<Hypercynder> ???
<Sumica> 00,10most that will happen is you will lose contact with people on diffrent servers then you
<Java> They also had secret relation with Yakuza to fund their first console.... Oh well.
<Kandarihu> You know, I saw what happened to Bigcheese. I get the feeling he doesn't even know what he did wrong.
<Sumica> 00,10it's for the greater good
<Sumica> 00,10a certen website is to blame for network issues >_>
<AttackWithHugs> Sumica, does said website start with a 'four'?
<Sumica> 00,10nope
<AttackWithHugs> Okay then.
<Sumica> 00,10but it ends with a state
<Java> is it start with 9??
<J_E_Smith71> Hey at least they do the maintenace now instead of some important time like Movie Night or new episode
<AttackWithHugs> Aaaah
<Kandarihu> It was 4state!
<Invi> Sumica, is it because of the ponychat issues last week?
<Sumica> 00,10mmmhmm

<SpeccyRush> hold her you fool
<aniderp> kiss her fool
<Invi> what is oz?
<TrixieMuffins> that family acts kinda stupid , its like blaming Einstein for dropping the nuke. the guy had his producttaken and weaponized and suddenly its his fault
<Java> It IS his fault
<Java> He doesn't even try to help to stop it
<Sumica> 00,10it was a hacking AI
<taoumi> but it was openhimer that actualy made the thing TrixieMuffins
<Sumica> 00,10it was already a weapon
<Sumica> 00,10only it was released on the net with out his say
<therainbowvortex> hey guys what dose gakmean i keep seeing it every where
<Invi> lol
<aniderp> forbidden here..
<Sumica> 00,10*snerk*
<aniderp> the forbidden g word
<taoumi> Oppenheimer*
<SirGanjalf> We don't speak about g-word here, anymore...
<Sumica> 00,10there is a know your meme on it
<Ecoyli> Ok bye everyone. Have to sleep.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye Ecoyli. :)
<Invi> taoumi, but einstein made the basics
<SirGanjalf> cool map
<taoumi> night Ecoyli
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica do i need to install episodes from liberty city for the multiplayer or it's just extra stuff ?
<J_E_Smith71> therainbowvortex: It was a series of toy ads that played over and over during the S3 premiere in a row and everyone poked fun at it and spammed the hell out of it. Somehow it turned into a forced meme
<Sumica> 00,10but the long in the short of it hub shows too many gak ad's in a row
<Sumica> 00,10and well with all the bronys watching
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Invi> now sumi has to kick himself :P
<aniderp> its a toy from the early 2000'2 right?
<[]DeadpoolDash> they going on a raid
<aniderp> 2000's
<Sumica> 00,10Nice PC

<[]DeadpoolDash> super computer much
<Sumica> 00,10now we need power
<J_E_Smith71> Thats' a big ass Black Wii
<Invi> genius driver
<SirGanjalf> Let there be light!
<Java> At least Einstein and Nobel done something to compensate their inventions.
<Java> Especially Nobel.
<Sumica> 00,10a squid boat should give us enough power
<taoumi> what enstine made Invi was a theroy on how mater in the universe came to be. oppenheimer was the one who actualy made and did the math to release that energy
<Sumica> 00,10now we need internet
<aniderp> fish
<Java> Heheh
<Invi> taoumi, yeah but if einstein hadn't that revolutionary theory, oppengheimer had no basics to do his math
<SirGanjalf> secret agent man
<Java> This family is awesome.
<Tovler> My Summer Wars senses are tingling.
<Java> Hacker family.
<J_E_Smith71> Them DSes
<Rain> dem gameboys
<aniderp> it looks like a dsi
<taoumi> well that's liek saying that al lmachines that use f=ma were made my newton
<Java> family that hack together, stay together.
<Buytoast> now is that a boy or a girl?

<Sumica> 00,10Well with luck that will meen we dont have errors saterday
<aniderp> hm
<taoumi> but newton was not directly responsable for them Invi. that's my point, yes they brought out the basic math. but enstine no more invented the nuke then newton invented the gun
<aniderp> the split happened already?
<AttackWithHugs> aniderp, yep
<Sumica> 00,10chat recorded over 40k
<J_E_Smith71> aniderp: Yeah it was brief

<Java> I want to go dinner but this is getting interesting!
<Sumica> 00,10video recorded close to 250K
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Wow.

<Sumica> 00,10but yeah good god we had so many viewers
<pony_129830> hmm

<Moopy> Hey that minecraft avatar hes pretty easy to make i can do that
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: More than S2 finale?
<Sumica> 00,10I was expecting 5-7k
<AJIsAwesome> 250,0000?

<CrystalPhoenix> Java it's interesting
<Java> Yes?
<CrystalPhoenix> The song in the video is in english but the people doing it were french
<Java> Maybe that's why. I remember it as French because of the band origin.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f46e78b3a58a53def07ca1800258a017.jpg AJ makes for the best human ponies :3

<CrystalPhoenix> is it bad that I want this to be canon so bad?
<CrystalPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/KSeqs.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> CrystalPhoenix: I don't think it's bad.

<alexxm1> can someone kick alexxm my internet derped
<Ponies47> Good morning :3
<alexxm> how've you been Ponies47
<Ponies47> ok alexxm
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponies47. :)
<Ponies47> You?
<alexxm> i'm good
<aniderp> my head hurts
<SirGanjalf> morning Ponies47
<CrystalPhoenix> I'm totally horrible
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<alexxm> what happened CrystalPhoenix
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/6e53693ce38fdcb2be8b8b1087f0bf3e.png even like this Fluttershy is adorable :D
<CrystalPhoenix> You're caring that's what happens
<Ponies47> MadSurge, Dat human Flutterrage
<MadSurge> Ayup
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Intimidating, but adorable. :D
<Java> I remember her hair do when she transform into crystal ponies. She had the best hairdo.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: exactly
<Java> AJ.... not so much
<MadSurge> Java: AJ was looking for her hat
<AJIsAwesome> I found Rarity to have the best hairdo, followed by RD. Pinkie's was bland, and so was Fluttershy's IMO.
<CrystalPhoenix> Java I disagree
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity had the best Hairdo
<CrystalPhoenix> then again Rarity is best pony
<Java> No one comment about Twilight's XD
<Ponies47> No stream correct?
<AJIsAwesome> Fluttershy's hairdo was the most generic, IMO.
<AJIsAwesome> Nope, Ponies47.
<CrystalPhoenix> Java who's Twilight
<Java> Really? generic?
<AJIsAwesome> Nothing about her hairdo really changed.
<Java> I think that fit her so well.
<Java> Twilight Sparkle. Librarian
<Java> Librarian hair do
<CrystalPhoenix> doesn't ring a bell

<Java> xD
<Java> Get ready
<AJIsAwesome> It reminds me of her hairdo for the gala. It didn't really differentiate from her normal hairstyle.
<CrystalPhoenix> anyway RD's harido is pretty much http://derpy.me/aRDul
<CrystalPhoenix> and I have to go
<AJIsAwesome> Now RD's hairdo was pretty interesting. Never thought her crystal design would be like that, considering her normal hairstyle.
<MadSurge> Bye CrystalPhoenix!
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, CrystalPhoenix. :)
<Java> Actually RD hairdo is this:

<Alchemist> my mind is full of buck
<Kandarihu> Heh, so why are we watching it upside down?
<Kandarihu> Okay, never mind
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Because it's BUCKING OPPOSITE DAY
<Squallken> its Topsy Trivy
<naturesfury> i think scoots is f'ing with us
<Scoot-Scootaloo> >_>
<RaveBrony> HAH! Joke's on you!! Im now sitting upside down in my chair now!
<DashWithRainbows> Hold on a second.
<RaveBrony> >_>
<DashWithRainbows> Scoot-Scootaloo, isn't it about 9am for you?
<MadSurge> Saturn: also in "the house of the dead overkill" the final boss is modelled after Dead Alive's protagonist's mom :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> DashWithRainbows: No it's 8:52am est >: (
<RaveBrony> Trolling duck
<DashWithRainbows> Well sorrrry.
<DashWithRainbows> Mister grumpy butt.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> <3
<Squallken> bbl
<RaveBrony> I need some breakfast
<DashWithRainbows> Oh, also Scoot-Scootaloo, hopefully my copy of Halo 4 should arrive tomorrow.
<DashWithRainbows> If it doesn't though, I'll have to wait (hopefully) until monday.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Aww yeah! We can play some Spartan Ops next week! ^_^
<RaveBrony> Im not entirely pleased with Halo 4 :I
<RaveBrony> The point system, classes, and armor are a bit much to me.
<AdamTheDuck> RaveBrony, hmm
<AdamTheDuck> I was wondering if there were going to be people with that opinion
<Zawan> eh only thing i dont like is no presicion control in Forge
<DashWithRainbows> Scoot-Scootaloo Saxy should have his copy by now, shouldn't he?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> He should :S
<AdamTheDuck> I mean, I stopped playing at Halo 3, I was just wondering how some will cope with these changes in Halo 4.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I don't know, he hasn't told us if he got it
<DashWithRainbows> Maybe he is cranking it out right now?
<DashWithRainbows> Or he's still asleep.
<RaveBrony> I pretty much stopped PvP at Halo 3
<RaveBrony> Played the campaigns for the other games after that
<SirGanjalf> drunk people
<RaveBrony> But now you play online and it depends on what armor you have to be better... kinda sucks for new players
<RaveBrony> Or at least thats what ive seen so far.
<AdamTheDuck> Whoa what
<MadSurge> YAAAAAY
<AdamTheDuck> Armour affects gameplay?
<reinier> wooot
<AdamTheDuck> Wow...
<RaveBrony> I think so, you buy it and such
<RaveBrony> With your rank
<Snow> LOL
<RaveBrony> Ive only played one game so i cant say much. Id have to ask my bro
<Zawan> armor does NOT affect gameplay
<RaveBrony> Hmm
<DashWithRainbows> >Halo >Armour makes you stronger
<DashWithRainbows> Dohoho
<DashWithRainbows> No.
<DashWithRainbows> armour variations*
<RaveBrony> Perhaps its the classes.
<MadSurge> :D
<Zawan> when you rank up you get spartan points that you unlock weapons and armor abilities, tactical/Support uppgrades with
<MadSurge> JAAYYYYSSSSONNNN
<RaveBrony> So, wouldnt that be an advantage over new players?
<RaveBrony> Wait, what is this on stream?
<Zawan> not that much its just custom loadouts there are always fully kitted loadouts available
<naturesfury> the new assins creed RaveBrony
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: Two Best Friends Play Assassin's Creed 3
<RaveBrony> Hmm, i see. and Ah, never played Assassin's Creed :L
<alexxm> naturesfury is it good

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Think of a yellow school bus with people in white shirts...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Now imagine they were edible...
<Kandarihu> America was still good before Twinkies. Not that the Twinkies were a bad thing, though.
<DashWithRainbows> So you guys eat both buses and people?

<MadSurge> Barb|MyLilPseudonym: there never is enough Pinkie Pie. Like dakka
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Maybe that is just me.
<Native-Warrior> Kinda random, but I think you should be kicked for referencing RWJ

<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> You would kick some one for yawning
<MadSurge> Lil_B: :D
*Barb|MyLilPseudonym yawns

<Dark92Enigma> there wont be enough CYANIDE PILLS to hold too many Pinkie Pies
<Snow> a window licking fox is.
<Native-Warrior> FUCK YOU
<Kammerjunk> Are you talking about "Now I have seen everything"?
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Yeah, but it is a "Native-Warrior has a power trip" reference.
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> You used to be cool man
<Dark92Enigma> Native-Warrior: why me!?
<Lil_B> Abby Road :P
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> What happened to you!!
<Native-Warrior> Not you mate

<Native-Warrior> Snow
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Please. No pants
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: cyanide is not effective on a cartoon horsie :D
<Snow> like i quoted
<alexxm> Deacon tormorow will tell us if thats true
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> We don't believe in pants
<Snow> "now i have seen everything."
<Native-Warrior> "I fear no man...but that thing.... it scares me"
<Kammerjunk> That's hardly an RWJ original.
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: you're right :D
<Kammerjunk> I just realised I said "RWJ" and "original" in the same sentence.
<Lil_B> btw, who is streaming? I see no Desktop Ponies to get any indications!

<DerpyMuffinHooves> It's my space....you can't have it.
<RaveBrony> o_e

<Vordox> Has ask princess Molestia been banned from TUMBLER?!
<BladedWings> O_o
<AttackWithHugs> Vordox, no. I was on there the other day
<Vordox> AttackWithHugs: Check again
<AttackWithHugs> I don't think it was, at least
<DerpyMuffinHooves> brb
<BladedWings> Vordox: whoa...what!?
*BladedWings flips a table "Noooo, i loved hat tumblr"
<Vivix> there's something going on at tumblr
<BladedWings> *that
<Vivix> because of their tagging system, tagging something nsfw doesn't really work
<Saturn> 08,01huh
<Vivix> at least, that's th reasoning I heard
<Saturn> 08,01John Joseco draws Ask Princess Molestia, right?
<Wrek> 05dont act so suprised
<Vivix> so they wanted to start writing NSFWpony NSFWTwilight etc
<Saturn> 08,01i'll ask him what happened
<Vivix> JJ yeah
<Wrek> 05tumblr doesnt allow overly sexual tumblrs
<Wrek> 05it was a matter of time
<Vivix> ^
<Vordox> Wrek: So?
<Saturn> 08,01but it wasn't overly sexual... well, not explicitly sexual
<Vordox> Wrek: It's not SHOWING anything sexual
<Wrek> 05Saturn: i recall the darign do's were?
<BladedWings> Wrek: still, i thought it was funny...and not thaaat bad DX
<Vordox> It's PEOPLE who make it sexual =P
<Wrek> 05neither did I
<Vivix> It's not explicit, but it is sexual
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn It was more joking around then anything.
<Wrek> 05i didnt midn it at all
<Wrek> 05but still
<AttackWithHugs> It wasn't as explicit as some other tumblrs
<Vivix> I don't know tumblrs rules
<Wrek> 05you cant really be suprised
<Vivix> other tumblrs vanish every day
<Wrek> 05at it
<Vordox> Inb4 10000+ fans hatebombs tumbler
<Everlasting_Joy> Maybe enough people complained about it, illegitametly or not.
<DashWithRainbows> Vordox He has over 20k I believe
<Vordox> Wrek: I am, cause APM was a fun comic, with perverted nature, but it never showed ANYTHING sexual
<Vordox> Perverted, yes, Sexual, no, not even close.
<Vivix> That's enough to get you blocked by a sfw rule
<shana> why did I get kicked oO
<Wrek> 05Vordox: i KNOW
<Wrek> 05but really
<Wrek> 05its tumblr
<Vordox> Wrek: It's haters
<Kimori> hey
<Vivix> no, tumblr has been doing cleanouts for a while
<Vordox> Or people who thinks it's sexual, when it's perverted. ._.
<Wrek> 05how very paranoid of you
<Vivix> especially, if you have foalcon or implied foalcon, they will take it down
<Vivix> perverted is inheritly sexual
<DashWithRainbows> It is highly likely there is a group of individuals reporting NSFW blogs.
<Vivix> even if it is humour and not pornographic, it is nsfw
<Vordox> "Omg I saw a chair that looked like a dildo! OMG CLOASE THAT SEX STORRREE" <--- This happens trust me. :P
<DashWithRainbows> I've seen Doxy go down, Smitty and some others.
<BladedWings> well this sucks but i'll get over it eventually...and JJ will do something about it...maybe XD
<Vivix> They should do it on another blog-service that allows their material
<Sylandest> DashWithRainbows: I actually know something about that. Its been investigated. Mind if I link it to you?
<Vivix> whining about this is just silly
<DashWithRainbows> Sure, PM me.
<Vivix> (not that you are whining, but some artists were)
<Vivix> http://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/community
<pony_3290> OMCBRONIESIJUSTSAWRAINBOWDASHONHOTTOPIC'SHOTMINUTE!
<Vivix> NSFW is allowed if it is flagged
<Wrek> 05sad to see him loose ald the messages and followers
<Vordox> pony_3290: Now take a breathe and say it cally?
<Wrek> 05but its not that hard to mkae another tumblr
<Vordox> calmy*
<AttackWithHugs> Hope he hass all that art backed up someplace
<Wrek> 05and all the followers probably know its down, follow JJ, will fidn out what the potential new one is and jsut follow
<Wrek> 05again
<pony_3290> I saw Rainbow Dash on hot topic's hot minute
<Vivix> But please don't use Tumblr's Upload Video feature to host any sexually explicit videos. We're not in the business of profiting from adult-oriented videos and hosting this stuff is fucking expensive
<Vivix> tumblr is funny in their wording
<AttackWithHugs> I'm sure there's lot of NSFW tumblrs out there but it seems the pony ones are the ones being taken down
<Vivix> I think more are being, but I'm not sure
<Everlasting_Joy> AttackWithHugs: That wouldn't surprise me.
<AttackWithHugs> Then again, I haven't really kept up with a lot of them so...*shrug*
<Vivix> there are trolls, obviously
<MadSurge> AttackWithHugs: I don't care about pony sex anyway :|
<Vivix> Ponys want to feel good too ;__;
<AttackWithHugs> Or they could have gotten JJ's info somehow and told Tumblr to delete the blog
<Vordox> MadSurge: Since when has APM been anything with sex?(Like... 3/10 of a post is perverted, rest is just fun
<pony_3290> Rainbow Dash is on Hot Topic's Hot Minute
<MadSurge> Vivix: not in front of me though :D
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vordox> HECK, even that contest they just had was GREAT fun with no perversion
<AttackWithHugs> Vordox, the Gamer Luna one?
<Vordox> AttackWithHugs: That one especially. :(
<AttackWithHugs> I liked those. They were awesome.
<Vivix> Well, if the blog was tagged as NSFW in the settings, this shouldn't ahve happened, but contests can get you delted as-well
<Vivix> "Unauthorized contests, sweepstakes" etc
<Vordox> Vivix: Maybe infringement?
<AttackWithHugs> Because it's now Ask Princess Molestia + Gamer Luna
<Vordox> Not sent from Hasbro, but from haters. :P or arseholes
<DashWithRainbows> There was no actual prize except recognition though.
<Vivix> Infringement and TM is reaaaally copmlicateed, so I won't go into that, don't understand it
<DashWithRainbows> Well, that I know of.
<AttackWithHugs> And speaking of things deleted, I don't see Balloon Party on Bandcamp.
<Vivix> I don't think there was a price either
<AttackWithHugs> Welp, time to torrent it
<Vordox> Oh, Sombra. <3
<Vordox> http://firebrandkun.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Sombra-is-Annoying-Comic-337862669
<AttackWithHugs> Let's see, I have uTorrent, mIRC, Avast, Skype
<AttackWithHugs> Still need CCleaner, ASC, Spybot, PowerISO and something else
<XAX> Steam.
<AttackWithHugs> Oh yeah, that too
<DashWithRainbows> Hmmm, I need to think of a couple names for 2 bases for a game I'm playing.
<Everlasting_Joy> Vordox: :D
<DashWithRainbows> Any suggestions?
<AttackWithHugs> And I ALWAYS forget my Steam password.
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Dogfort and Catfort.
<DashWithRainbows> Lawls.
<XAX> DashWithRainbows: Fort Loadsamoney
<Vordox> DashWithRainbows: Carpmane and Hoofers?
<DashWithRainbows> Lookin' for something somewhat pony related.
<XAX> DashWithRainbows: Fort RainbowDosh
<XAX> muney.
<DashWithRainbows> Princess Luna, Celestia, Princess Cadence and Chrysalis are already being used.
<Everlasting_Joy> DashWithRainbows: Canterlot and Crystal Empire.
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<DashWithRainbows> Perfect.
<DashWithRainbows> Well, Canterlot can be my main base :P
<Vordox> Any news about John, Saturn ?
<AttackWithHugs> WinRAR and 7zip
<Saturn> 08,01i'd use Queen Chrysalis
<Saturn> 08,01if you know what i mean
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn only 16 char-
<Sylandest> oh my~
<DashWithRainbows> God damn it XD
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: not heard anything yet; he's away at the moment
<Sylandest> That's our Saturn!
<Saturn> 08,01i'll let you know when he responds
<Vordox> Saturn: Chrysatoss?
<DashWithRainbows> Oh wait, Queen Chrysalis does fit.
<DashWithRainbows> Cheers Saturn :P
