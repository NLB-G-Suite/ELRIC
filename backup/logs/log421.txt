*Invi|braindead hugs Twi_Fi Spectrum_Rush Simon2 and somepony_else
<Tovler|depressed> Mortal Kombat 7?
<fapplebloom> wh-what?
<pegasiss666> there is no new episode
<foxinator> never knew they even showed anime's in here :p
<Twi_Fi> MLP is over.
*Spectrum_Rush is hugged
<Twi_Fi> for now
<Kencolt> Where it was printed is of no import to me-- it's basic elements are more shojo thahn shonen. I can only conclude that it was printed there because it wasn't QUITE as unrelenting shojo as most phonebook titles prefer.
<kenne> foxinator: they show anything in here
<Polydunami> foxinator: Whatever's entertaining
<fapplebloom> pegasiss666: i know, im just being a sarcastic ass
<Tovler|depressed> welcome to 5 months of no episodes.
<foxinator> bet you they dont show porn
*Spectrum_Rush hugs Invi|braindead back
*DeathStar dances
<Pterodactyl> hi
<kenne> Tovler|depressed: i think its only going to be 3
<pegasiss666> NOOOO
<fapplebloom> can you show porn?
<Twi_Fi> no
<foxinator> they cant
<Fattonie> so where are you getting the vids from these animes anyway?
<Polydunami> Not here
<fapplebloom> ok
<Invi|braindead> hi Pterodactyl
<fapplebloom> just asking...
<Smitty01> No, they keep the stream G-rated
<Kencolt> Well, PG. Usually.
<Twi_Fi> G-rated may be a stretch.....
<kenne> foxinator: yeah NSFW is pretty much not allowed here
<Polydunami> Smitty01: They showed the new Lupin III here
<Sumica> 00,10nyaa.net
<fapplebloom> i should hope they never show porn
<Tovler|depressed> bah. It's too early in the morning to show any more Lupin III episodes.
<Kandarihu> PG-13, occassionally R for Brony Movie Night. No worse than that
<richfiles_tablet> Oh HAY no! Lupin the third was NOT "G" RATED! LOL :D
<pegasiss666> BUFFERING
<fapplebloom> im certainly not requesting that
<foxinator> kenne: so they dont show anything here :p
<Kencolt> Eh, the new Lupin III , those boobs were an abstract.
<kenne> foxinator: well there are some exceptions
<Spectrum_Rush> pg? da new lupin the III episodes woulde beg to differ
<pegasiss666> house was on dis stream and it wuz not g rated
<YamaTHou> what's nyaa.net?
<foxinator> kenne: wot??
<fapplebloom> foxinator: cant you just enjoy the conversation?
<richfiles_tablet> MT. FUJIKO
<richfiles_tablet> SD
<kenne> i almost forgot about the lupin the third thing
<Tovler|depressed> Lupin was only R-rated
<Pterodactyl> No, but putting swear words in sutitles is fine.
<pegasiss666> MASS EFFECT 2
<foxinator> fapplebloom: always :p
<YamaTHou> fuck yeah
<Polydunami> That you, Sumica?
<Pterodactyl> Mass effect 4
<Kandarihu> Right. Mass Effect 2 isn't exactly G rated
<Kencolt> THose weren't boobs. They were an idealised symbolic representations of... Um... boobs.
<YamaTHou> I miss that voiced :3
<Fattonie> dick shep up in this motha
<MadSurge> Mass Effect 2? NOOOOO
<kenne> Tovler|depressed: thats hard to believe
<Kandarihu> But it isn't porn
<Pterodactyl> yay
<Smitty01> What do i go clop to, tho?
<pegasiss666> im thinking about literal trailers
<foxinator> never seen mass effect befor
<fapplebloom> mass effect 4: the reapers came back and also they brought mecha sharks

<fapplebloom> im not trying to be mean here but mining for minerals in mass effect 2 is not the best way to please a crowd
<pegasiss666> mass effect 2
*Polydunami quietly slips out of chat and heads to bed
<Kandarihu> Mutterguy: some of us are being perverted.

<MadSurge> So why is this considered an RPG? Seems more like a third person shooter with RPG dialogues to me...
<fapplebloom> Kammerjunk: well then get it done already
<Krakass> I am weasel
<Dog> WOOF
<Kammerjunk> Oh shut up, Grunt.
<alexxm> hey Dog hows your day been
<fapplebloom> MadSurge: you get to play a role, therfire rpg QED
<fapplebloom> MadSurge: *therefore
<Invi|braindead> moin Dog
<aqua_dusk> So what are you up to SuperBrony64?
<MadSurge> If you say so :D
<fapplebloom> THANE HELPED
<Fattonie> he took those bullets for you
<Krakass> Hey Dog, I really like your tumblr http://textfromdog.tumblr.com/
<aqua_dusk> Yeah it does :p
<fapplebloom> YES IT DOES
<Kammerjunk> fapplebloom: Eenope. Like 50% of all servers have sv_pure set to either 1 or 2. Id est, it doesn't work with custom meshes. Most of them just don't let you join if your game files don't fit theirs.
<Fattonie> operation meat shiled all the way
<BronyJenkins> :/
<fapplebloom> it's bullets you didn't have to absorb
<aqua_dusk> XD
<fapplebloom> distraction is a valid combat tactic
<aqua_dusk> at least he took cover this time
<fapplebloom> that's what i tell myself in paintball
<Dog> kROGAN MEAT SHIELD
<Invi|braindead> that bitch in ME1 killed my Wrek :(
<Kammerjunk> Giving someone else cover while they make a run for it is better than a distraction.
*alexxm tickles Dog behind his ears
<Invi|braindead> *Wrex
<Kammerjunk> "What did we learn? I always win!"
<Dog> alexxm
<Dog> ;
<Dog> what

<fapplebloom> Kammerjunk: i honestly have no idea what you mean, so ill defer to your judgement
<Kammerjunk> fapplebloom: It means that most servers are party poopers.
<fapplebloom> nice purple armor
<Kammerjunk> I concur, Sumica.
<fapplebloom> Kammerjunk: then just murder them with your party cannon
<RainBowJack> sumica : is the BFG on CoolDown?
<fapplebloom> Kammerjunk: party cannon as a weapon is now canon
<RainBowJack> aha okay
<Kammerjunk> >is now canon
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<garrus_vakarian> Shot him in the dick
<alexxm> shoot him in the ass
<MadSurge> I like Sumica's voice!
<fapplebloom> i honestly was not trying to make a pun
<Fattonie> you gonna take that from him?
<Mutterguy> MadSurge don't make this weird
<RainBowJack> yeah Sumica has a nice voice indeed
<fapplebloom> your voice is orgasmic
<aqua_dusk> They need bass cannon fapplebloom
<Kammerjunk> What I dislike the most about ME3 is not being able to mess around with corpses.
<Gunthler> DAT YAY
<garrus_vakarian> Kammerjunk: please rephrase that
<alexxm> shoot him in the ass
<RainBowJack> NUKE IT!!!
<Fattonie> bank shot
<Invi|braindead> wohoo
<fapplebloom> it would be more disturbing if you could see what i was doing
<Mutterguy> pew pewpew pewpew pewpew pewpew pewpew pew
<garrus_vakarian> nuke his dick off
<Dog> fapplebloom is a krogan
<MadSurge> Arright, but I'm not gay, he's just pleasant to listen at :D
<Kammerjunk> garrus_vakarian: In ME3, I can't move corpses around with biotics.
<fapplebloom> RUN AWAY
<garrus_vakarian> better
<Gunthler> ded
<RainBowJack> CLEAR!!!
<MadSurge> WOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
<garrus_vakarian> slightly radiated but clear
<fapplebloom> Dog: is that a compliment?
<Mutterguy> RPG FOR THE WINN!
<MadSurge> Robodogs

<MadSurge> "Oops, my baaad"
<Mutterguy> do the party trick again!
<aqua_dusk> night garru_vakarian
<Kammerjunk> "Nothing can hurt me!" he said behind cover.
<alexxm> cya garrus_vakarian
<aqua_dusk> although In my opinion this is the perfect time to be awake
<Invi|braindead> let's hope the enemies don't have such a overkill gun ^^
<aqua_dusk> cause the moon is up

<Ninjazz> Maybe.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Season 4 hasn't been confirmed
<pony_7601> season 3 was already fortold in january 2012
<pony_7601> bronycon
<fapplebloom> YamaTHou: Maybe. *sniff* Maybe.
<pony_7601> i'm sure they done a lot of eps in season 3
<derpy_pony> mlp will get more seasons than dr who
<YamaTHou> There should be a season 4
<derpy_pony> but from season 5 on, it will be horrible
<lollerguy> if only season 3 wasnt 13 episodes :c
<Ninjazz> We'll see.
<pony_7601> i still thuiink season 1 is better then season 2
<YamaTHou> If MLP stop producing what will happen to us?
<pony_7601> but the last eps on season two RPCKED
<lollerguy> ^
<Ninjazz> Not sure.
<Mutterguy> after the recption the finale got...they're probly getting ready to write the new contracts
<fapplebloom> YamaTHou: i think it's perfectly reasonable to expect a profitiable show to go on as long as it can
<pony_7601> tHE Writers for season 3 are the same ones from season 1
<Very_Silly_Filly> It will probably be august, since S2 came in August.
<derpy_pony> When they cancel the show, we will go postal wearing pinkie pie suits
<YamaTHou> <fapplebloom> yeah I thinks so....
<derpy_pony> all over the world

<Saturn> 08,01fapplebloom: but we were just talking about fillies!
<[Zzz]JRP2234> Memomoooo
<Saturn> 08,01and you said it was relevant
<YamaTHou> <DavidCortez> yeah hete in my country its 7:45 pm!
<Saturn> 08,01unless you meant relevant to beltane

<Saturn> 08,01or... ireland?
<Ninjazz> The racist race.

<Twi_Fi> http://derpy.me/disgusting

<Fattonie> Saturn: I'm waiting for a fic where she is the only hetero of the main 6 just for shits and giggles
<[Zzz]JRP2234> Zzzzzzzzzz
<Saturn> 08,01fapplebloom: but you were implying you wante to show me pictures of fillies
<smitlern77> Ponies ae best ponies. Rainbow dash is a pegasus. Fluttershy is shy. Rarity likes clothes. Applejack likes apples
<TheRandomkid321> Ok then Ninjazz.... I once had an erotic dream about ponies... should I see a physcaratrist...
<Mutterguy> they found astar practically identical to the sun 200 ly away
<Saturn> 08,01TheRandomkid321: there's nothing in the show to indicate her sexuality
<DIgit|Skyrim> Yes.
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321: No... Just keep it to yourself.
<DIgit|Skyrim> xD
<TheRandomkid321> Ok Ninjazz
<Twi_Fi> wow, did chat.
<Twi_Fi> *dis
<Ninjazz> U serrious?
<fapplebloom> Saturn: that doesn't necessarily mean im attracted to fillies, i just like the art
<Saturn> 08,01i've seen r34 of fluttershy taking a dump on big macintosh; doesn't make it canon.
<Twi_Fi> wut
<TheRandomkid321> Im not serious... I just wanted to see your reactions
<Saturn> 08,01fapplebloom: well, fair enough
<Renard> wat
<Ninjazz> wut
<DIgit|Skyrim> what?
<Fattonie> oh gaws
<smitlern77> Saturn is attracted to pastile coloured animated horses.
<YamaTHou> whats r34???
<fapplebloom> Saturn: in all sincerity i have absolutely no art of that nature
<Ninjazz> >_(\
<lollerguy> *facehoof*
<TheRandomkid321> YamaTHou how old are you?
<Saturn> 08,01smitlern77: unless your mother is a pastile coloured animated horse, i'd have to say no
<Ninjazz> Great now the newbie is curious
<RainbowAsh> YamaTHou, rule 34 of the internet: There is porn of it. No exceptions.
<Mutterguy> YamaTHou you don't need to find out

<YamaTHou> I'm 15
<smitlern77> Saturn: Your mother jokes, how mature.
<fapplebloom> i dont even have porn on my computer, what's the point when you have free streaming websites?
<Saturn> 08,01but then again, i only say her from behind
<Mutterguy> in fairness, it's 10 pm here
<Twi_Fi> lollerguy, you must be old here.
<Saturn> 08,01and her mouth was full
<lollerguy> lol
<Saturn> 08,01*saw

<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh my god
<TheRandomkid321> Ninjazz It was the 80s.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Itemrape before the finish line q.q
<fapplebloom> YamaTHou: neither, im just trolling the doctor
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321: So.
<Twi_Fi> The new villain in season 3 will be a human.
<TheRandomkid321> Ninjazz everything had humans
<Saturn> 08,01fapplebloom: the hill dancing thing
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321: And?
<YamaTHou> <Twi_Fi> lol,that's just weird
<TheRandomkid321> How do ya know Twi_Fi?
<Brony_Luna> clopping is magic
<fapplebloom> Saturn: i don't understand, could you demonstrate?
<YamaTHou> human's in MLP???
<smitlern77> He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheartShe's his cranky doodle joyI helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yes!I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!
<Saturn> 08,01fapplebloom: interpretive dance would be strangle appropriate
<YamaTHou> That will be weird as hell
<RainbowAsh> fapplebloom, as promised, pony sex canon. It's number 3. in the list: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/76295879/130326839506.png

<Saturn> 08,01*strangly
<Saturn> 08,01good god, i cannot type today
<fapplebloom> RainbowAsh: im not clicking that fucking link, rest assured
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321: Do I have to?
<Saturn> 08,01you know what i meant.
<YamaTHou> Me too
<TheRandomkid321> Yes Ninjazz
<Mutterguy> fragle rock?
<fapplebloom> Saturn: i don't. Elaborate.
<RainbowAsh> fapplebloom, be strong, it's just a collection of quote's from Lauren Faust's dA
<YamaTHou> is It some kind of pony porn?
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321: I mean I don't see the relevance of having to do that since we are talking about MLP FiM.
<Saturn> 08,01fapplebloom: it's fine, it it was porn, i'd have kickbanned him fo rit
<smitlern77> First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
<YamaTHou> woah
<YamaTHou> so bad ass
<TheRandomkid321> Ninjazz its the only way to prove my beliefs
<smitlern77> for your happiness
<Ninjazz> Time to add someone to the mute list it seems.
<TheRandomkid321> No ok ill be good
<Ninjazz> Not you!
<TheRandomkid321> oh ok
<Twi_Fi> Proof humans are in season 3: http://derpy.me/OPkto
<Ninjazz> Not you, TheRandomkid321. We're just debating, is all.
<fapplebloom> Saturn: no porn whatsoever. I'm dissappointed.
<TheRandomkid321> Oh Twi_Fi ya really had me going there
<YamaTHou> yeah
<TheRandomkid321> I agree Ninjazz.
<YamaTHou> its says lol jk
<foxinator> hey everypony how're you doing?
<YamaTHou> XD
<Tervicz> Humans in season 3?
<Fattonie> no witnesses
<Tervicz> nah
<YamaTHou> <foxinator> just fine...talking about pony porn and shit
<Sumica> 00,10http://i.imgur.com/GNhyn.jpg
<YamaTHou> jk
<Saturn> 08,01humans in s3 wouldn't fit with the style of the show
<Tervicz> Unless they run out of inspiration
<smitlern77> The fire of friendship lives in our heartsAs long as it burns we cannot drift apartThough quarrels arise, their numbers are fewLaughter and singing will see us through (will see us through)We are a circle of pony friendsA circle of friends we'll be to the very end
<fapplebloom> Saturn: ah, buit it does male pony secks canonical
<fapplebloom> but*
<Twi_Fi> I would prefer some bad art, actually.
<fapplebloom> dammit i cant type
<Digitalis> bad art makes me cry.
<fapplebloom> post some sexy art
<RainbowAsh> smitlern77, my favorite anthem
<foxinator> YamaTHou: talking 'bout buttsecks and shit are ya .. :p
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn I can think how they wuld look. I dont want to though
<smitlern77> thank you:)
<fapplebloom> SEX ART GO
<candy_mane> are we gonna watch the aquabats?
<RankWinner> No. Please god no...
<TheRandomkid321> I LUUUUV DA AQUABATS! WHO THE BUCK NEEDS COCAIN!??!!?
<Mutterguy> they're be directly out of power puff girls
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321, look man. All I am saying is that IF they do put humans in S3, then we should have some kind of faith in Studio B.
<Saturn> 08,01TheRandomkid321: they'd look like the humans in Dan Vs.
<Tervicz> Hmmm... Maybe Lauren Faust could become a character... Her alicorn perhaps?
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz: if humans appeared in S3, my faith in Studio B would be lost
<smitlern77> She's an evil enchantressShe does evil dancesAnd if you look deep in her eyesShe'll put you in trancesThen what will she do?She'll mix up an evil brewThen she'll gobble you upIn a big tasty stewSoooo.... Watch out!
<Saturn> 08,01because it seems so incongruent
<RainbowAsh> Saturn: Dan vs. Ponies would be a totally awesome crossover, though
<TheRandomkid321> Ninjazz all Im saying is that noone. Absolutly Noone could make it work.
<yankee> is wierd al going to be on the aquabats today
<Ninjazz> They probably won't, though.
<Ninjazz> Soon, probably.
<RankWinner> As would mine and everybody elses
<fapplebloom> Saturn: but i want to appear in s3
<Mutterguy> creator self-insertion.. bad idea
<Saturn> 08,01RainbowAsh: there's a Dan Vs. FiM tumblr
<Saturn> 08,01
<foxinator> talking bout hums in mlp s3? against that def!
<Ninjazz> Alright. Alright. I see your points. Sheesh.
<Saturn> 08,01http://imgur.com/uICCf <-- the sexiest pic
<RankWinner> But I seriously doubt humans would ever have a place in the MLP universe.
*Ninjazz sheesh
<Twi_Fi> I would want to be here for a streaming of an episode with humans in it, the chat would be epic.
<smitlern77> lol
<fapplebloom> Saturn: why should tori spelling be the only human to appea alongside ponies?
<Tervicz> Humans are too proud to obey other species
<Ninjazz> Dat Sexy Saturn :D
<TheRandomkid321> I ahve never lost a adebate... out of the two ive had
<RainbowAsh> Saturn: Nice. Do you happen to have the link?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh my god, Alpine cross was crazt
<Saturn> 08,01dan-vs-fim.tumblr.com
<Ninjazz> Well, you didn't really win the debate...
<Very_Silly_Filly> I got 5 blue shells in 1 track!
<fapplebloom> TheRandomkid321: tell me, how does one win a "adebate"?
<RainbowAsh> Saturn, I guess I could have guessed. ^^; Thanks
*Twi_Fi doesn't care for aquabats.

<smitlern77> Say I if you think you are sexy
<fapplebloom> Twi_Fi: so am I. Thank you.
<Digitalis> ewwwwww!
<Digitalis> god i hate that show.
<Tervicz> You know what would be a cool gag and would kind of introduce humans to MLP? If Pinkie Pie would need something and takes something seemingly from the audience, like a tool or a bag of pop corn...

<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Cypresswolf, welcome.
<Kandarihu> Okay. I never watched Chowder.
<Sumica> 00,10notice how more and more mods have sea pony Lyra =p
<Randomnerd> This looks great. Only thing that'd be better would be Chrysalis looking positively plum... standing over Shining armor's corpse.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm never gonna get tired of the 3D effect of this 3DS
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello everypony.:)

<RainbowAsh> Hi TheRainbowDash *hugs*
<Dark92Enigma> NEXT ON YOUTUBE:
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Kammerjunk, welcome.
<fapplebloom> show them
<Lil_B> I think Crysalis is better than Discord or Luna. The potential for her backstory is so good.
<RankWinner> Aw yeah love that song
<RankWinner> Or not
<EgrusDam> Agh my connection pooped out, MadSurge must be kicked out
<Cypresswolf> I went back and watched the first few eps of season 1 and I noticed something - the Dress Rarity is wearing in Ticket Master when she's talking about what she'd do at the Gala is the same one Cadence wears in pt 2 of season finale
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> :O
<Pterodactyl> Crysalis is the worst villan in this show.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz|SPAZ: Oh hello once again.:)
<EgrusDam> Really?
<aczumel> does anyone know where I can find a livestream for today's episode of aquabats?
<fapplebloom> incorrect

<Wrek|Observing> 05yes aczumel
<Wrek|Observing> 05here
<ghostpolitics> hopefully they'll stream it
<RainbowAsh> Crysalis seems to be mostly a predator. I can't see her having a backstory that ties in with anything from the show
<Sumica> 00,10here OC desktopponies http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/res/35944.html
<Dark92Enigma> I'm ignored...........:,(
<Randomnerd> She can actually be cruel and evil.

<Litwick> Isn't this the Aquabats episode where they give the bronies a shoutout?
<Wrek|Observing> 05IM EATIGN AS FAST AS I CAN
<Randomnerd> I don't care about her unhappy childhood, or rejection by some character.
<fapplebloom> FASTER DAMMIT
<EgrusDam> Yes Litwick
<Radu> Don't rush Wrek, eating fast is no good :c
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wrek|Observing: I c wut u did thar
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wrek revitalised a meme, silly
<Randomnerd> She throws two mares in a cave to die, so she can eat the love of a brave soldier, then conquer a kingdom.

<hii> soooo... anyone here seen firefly
<Randomnerd> That's stone-cold evil.

<TheRainbowDash> That Cadance Cypresswolf..amazing.:)
<RainbowAsh> Tovler|depressed, that sounds like a crossover between Avatar and Spongebob
<Lil_B> I thik she has great potential for a Backstory. How well does she care for her the Changelings? She said she invadet Equestria, too provide food for them because she is their queen. This is a nice fact for her personality.
<YamaTHou> sooo...who is the guy behind the stream?
<Litwick> Pandroa lives in a pineapple under the sea?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Dat Rarity
<Radu> Wrek is

<Radu> Oh, I've heard this somewhere, but where?
<EgrusDam> Next FiM villain should be a Nuckelavee :D
<Lil_B> How did she grew up in this world of Changelings? how is this world? How did she become queen? what did they do before they came to Equestria? That are some things I wouldn't mind too see XD
<Tovler> Do'h. I meant "Pandora's Piñata"
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: Damn right, it will.
<fapplebloom> is it hard to draw with a bunch of idiots commenting at you?
<YamaTHou> dat art skill...
<Cypresswolf> 200 million is coming up soon
<YamaTHou> is he using a mouse?
<Radu> He's using a tab, if I'm correct
<EgrusDam> fapplebloom: he doesn't seem to be bothered by us...
<Cypresswolf> what do you think 350 Million by year's end?
<Kammerjunk> Cypresswolf: At minimum.
<fapplebloom> EgrusDam: he's just shutting us out. Kinda hurtful to be honest...
<Kammerjunk> Sure, it took them two years tog et to ~170 million, but the fandom keeps growing.
<EgrusDam> :D
<Kammerjunk> to get*
<Chex> PONYTIME
<Chex> PONYTIME I SAY
<Radu> Hmm, how many bronies are we there?
<Kammerjunk> 42
<Digitalis> Chex, sweetie, calm down
<Radu> Oh you, Kammerjunk :D
<Chex> Season 1 > Season 2
<YamaTHou> dat drawing skill @_@
<Radu> Chex, you said that yesterday
<Cypresswolf> I got 30/100 things made up for season 3 bingo...not bad for 1 week
<Chex> and it's still true
<TheRainbowDash> To me, Season 1= Season 2, both 9.5/10.:)
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Disagree.
<Radu> No. It's not true. Nothing is true. Everybody got their own opinions. Nothing is true.
<Kammerjunk> I agree with TheRainbowDash. I rate both series poni/10.
<Lil_B> Does Somebody know who Chris Hülsbeck is?
<Pterodactyl> One day Rainbow Dash was flying around in Equestria when Henry VIII came out and was like off with her head, but then Rarity came in and tryed to give Henry a makeover but then Her head turned into a pineapple and everyone died.
<fapplebloom> yeah work that brush
<Kammerjunk> Chex: You're speaking about an opinion as if it's objective fact.
<TheRainbowDash> Pterodactyl: Ummm, what...:P
<Cypresswolf> I'll post the full version on Texas Brony Forum when the list is done
<Fattonie> I linked season 1 as a whole better, but season 2 has my favorite episodes
<EgrusDam> TheRainbowDash: They're a bit different, but both seasons are good, I agree
<Fattonie> liked*
<Radu> Lil_B, you can look him up on google
<Chex> Well it's just that, even in the weaker episodes of Season 1, I never really felt like I wasn't enjoying it
<TheRainbowDash> But that Season 2 finale, that was flawless, and the show at it
<Kammerjunk> Exactly. Opinion is subjective.
<Lil_B> Radu I know, I'm just asking if anyone else now who he is
<TheRainbowDash> F'inests moment, 100/0:)
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Opinion.
<Radu> Never heard of him, sorry

<Lil_B> Radu Chris made a Kickstarter campaign to fun the production of a Turrican Anthology Soundtrack CD-Set
<Tovler> I can't wait for Maka Wuhu to get patched in MK7.
<Chex> The DS was my first handheld
<pablez94> did i missed sonething?
<Kammerjunk> EgrusDam: Eeyup.
<Pterodactyl> Then Twilight Sparkle came in and woz like " What happened here?" and Fluttershy cried for no reason and then Mario and Luigi threw their hats at Applejack but she fired her lazers and exploded everything.
<Chex> Then I got a GenMobile... and an FC-16 Go
<Kammerjunk> Pterodactyl: Dude, wat.
<Radu> Oh, that's interesting Lil_B o:
<Chex> Clone consoles FTW
<pablez94> miss*
<TheRainbowDash> Pterodactyl: What is with you and your idea?:D
<Chex> It seems so much calmer in here when it's not Pony time
<EgrusDam> Kammerjunk: mfw I get to visit medieval Forlì and I go there everyday for university :D
<Lil_B> Radu it just reached it's goal, and I just wanted to let other Chris Hülsbeck Fans know about it so they can buy it too
<pablez94> i guess i haven't... hello everypony what's up?
<Kammerjunk> Pterodactyl: Meanwhile, in the sane world, I have no idea what's going on.

<Digit|Skyrim> Yesh

<Chex> Season 3... it's hard to say
<yifle1> will there be any pony episodes this saturday
<CCCP> no
<Pterodactyl> I think Crysalis is a very interesting character. I would like to hear her backstory about how she joined the Changelings. She has a dark personality and is very appealing to the eyes but appears to ripped off the zombies from Story of The Blanks. So I can't say her design is quite original but her sudden appearance and shit made her all the more epic.

<Soupjuice> do it >:D
<Videofreak1127> Is he using a tablet or the mouse?
<Twi_Fi> hmmmm
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> If he is your friend, shouldn't you expect him to expect you as a friend that watches MLP?
<Digit|Skyrim> a tablet
<Videofreak1127> ok
<pablez94> YamaTHou: if he is a GOOD friend even if i would not like mlp will stay your friend..
<Xera> Are you scared? I'd do it.
<Dken2021> if you just bring it up, it would probably sound weird

<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Don't try too hard.
<TheRainbowDash> Trying too hard=worse.:P
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Just make it look natural.
<Videofreak1127> This band sounds so familiar...
<Xera> I would ease into it. If it comes up like regular conversation, it wouldn't seem awkward.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> God knows how many people think we are weird as hell already.
<Pterodactyl> Another day in Equestria and Braeburn woz walking around with apples in his ass until Pinkie came up and hugged him and he got a wingboner and kissed a wall. Then Rarity tranformed his face into fluttershys pet rabbit.
<Xera> And with that, I leave now.
<Soupjuice> I wouldn't try worsening the percieved stereotype of bronies
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Anyway...
<EgrusDam> Pterodactyl: lmao

<yifle1> Kandarihu sounds interesting
<Pale_Horse> Would it involve the sea ponies rising up from the depths and taking over the kingdom? :P
<Dken2021> the future eh?
<Pterodactyl> 28 days later in Equestria, Rarity ate apple pie but then she remembered she was fabulous and woz like " I'm going to love Prince Blueballs" And went to The Grand Galloping Fala and ate to much cake and got fat, then AJ came in and laughed and exploded. Then Rarity used HADUKEN and blew up Canterlot.

<Phase4> lets see
<pablez94> OhioBronyShow: really i'm VERY happy for i wish i could find my very special somepony... but i'm not that beautifull so girls snub me...
<Barbetos> Sooo... is the pony shout out on aquabats going to be streamed today?
<AdamThePony> I love the glyph on her flank.
<Ralathon> Didn't Chrysalis also have some armor on her belly?
<pablez94> OhioBronyShow: for U*
<WallDives> good morning, all.
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, stop using vista
<Jewel> Morning y'all
<Radu> LOL Phase4 :D
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> WallDives, welcome.
<AdamThePony> I love how Lyra is swimming in the screen.
<Cypresswolf> O_o how could you tell Phase4
<Phase4> pablez94, linux brony, /)
<Jewel> So... Aqua bats is being streamed today right?
<OhioBronyShow> Well, I'm not beautiful either. But he somehow finds me as the most beautiful girl in the world.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Yes.
<Jewel> Awesome!
<Ralathon> How late is the Aquabats?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> OhioBronyShow: Your feels. It shows. :)
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, /ctcp [nickname] VERSION
<Cypresswolf> :D
<Pterodactyl> Then Cheerilee found herz spacial somepony and married her and they were happy until Rarity done A sonic rainbooom and RD woz like "nnnnoooo"
<TheRainbowDash> Ralathon: It will start streaming at 11:00 AM EST.
<Radu> What's up with everyone asking about Aquabats?!
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> pablez94: Its whats inside that matters. Don't you forget that!
<Ralathon> Thanks
<Phase4> might not work on your client
<Jewel> Because they are doing a Pony shout out today
<Phase4> example response: -pablez94- VERSION lightIRC.com 1.2.3 Build 101, Feb 16 2012 10:26 on Linux 3.0.0-17-generic
<TheRainbowDash> Pterodactyl: Wait, what....Rarity doing a sonic rainboom?!?!:O
<pablez94> +Phase4: whta do u meen?
<WallDives> whish I could believe that.
<OhioBronyShow> Aquabats is finally doing the Pony shout out!
<WallDives> wish^
<AdamThePony> Personally, I would only install Linux if I needed a new OS.
<Pale_Horse> There is supposed to be a pony-releated reference in Aquabats today, that's why.
<CTP_Bronystate> Where is the ponies?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> RARITY FTW
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> YEEEEAAAAAAH
<Jewel> In the corner
<Radu> inb4 they don't do it
<AdamThePony> I had a hilarious WTF moment this week.
<Phase4> pablez94, i'm guessing your on ubuntu
<TheRainbowDash> CTP_Bronystate: They will come soon, please be patient.
<Jewel> So what is being drawn?
<CTP_Bronystate> Wait for Season 3.
<AdamThePony> I remember I had Twilight Sparkle in my poket this week.
<Jewel> I want to say Queen Chrysisalisis
<pablez94> Ninjazz|SPAZ: i didn't are the other people that did...
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Jewel: Bingo.
<Cypresswolf> Phase4: I do have windows 7, but *expletive deleted* keeps shutting downt the installation every time I fix the former problem
<Jewel> Whoo!
<pablez94> +Phase4: how do u know??? i'm on Ubuntu !!.!=
<Jewel> Though I am surprised, no one has compared Changelings and Flutterponies
<pablez94> +Phase4:11.10*
<RyunosukeKnT> oh... my
<Dken2021> flutterponies?
<Pale_Horse> I like to call her "Queen Swisscheesealis"
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> pablez94: I doesnt matter what other people think, just remember what you are inside.
<Phase4> pablez94, because super tech powers!
<Jewel> Flutterponies
<Jewel> They are basically ponies with butterfly wings
<CTP_Bronystate> I like Princess Cadence.
<EpicPwnTime> getting bored
<pablez94> +Phase4: ok...
<Phase4> pablez94, actualy its the ctcp version response, it gives me your uname " Linux 3.0.0-17-generic"
<Pterodactyl> Then Rainbow Dash thought of revenge and captured Rarity and she woz like " You will never beat me batman" and then Applejack came in and woz like " Rarity I lovez you" and kissed Pinkie.
<WallDives> ...are we spewing nonsense about love?
<Jewel> Personally I like to believe that they mutated since g3 and g1 ended, and turned evil.
<Phase4> pablez94, and the '-generic' bit is ubuntu's naming scheme
<WallDives> why are we spewing nonsense about love?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Pterodactyl: Dun Dunn Duuuuunnnn :O
<TheRainbowDash> Pterodactyl: What kind of crazy story you thinking right now?:
<TheRainbowDash> :D
<pablez94> +Phase4: mr.nerd...
*Phase4 hugs pablez94
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> :0

<TheRainbowDash> Sylandest: Been like this for the past 4 days, and not getting any better, rather worse.
<ryaxnb> cool
*Ninjazz|SPAZ brohoofs pablez94
<RyunosukeKnT> had to share, it was pony related though ;)
<AdamThePony> seeing Crysalis makes me want to play as an insectoid in a D&D game
*pablez94 /) (\ Ninjazz|SPAZ
<RyunosukeKnT> well... ponyish
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: Have you visited the doctor?
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/KxMrY

<TheRainbowDash> Sylandest: Umm, well, it is not too bad, just annoying as hay.:|

<Ninjazz|SPAZ> TheRainbowDash: Get better soon, Dashie.
<Radu1> Nope
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: I want both of them to get runned over by the next train.:D
<Phase4> CCCP, XD
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: I can imagine, hehe. I hope you get to feeling better soon! We can't have our resident Rainbow Dash be sick
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: lol
<Cypresswolf> Phase4: I dont remember what random number sequence it had, Ill write it down if/when it happens again, but everytime Vista stops the ungrade and resets it
<pablez94> TheRainbowDash: awww i'm sorry for ur sicknes what do u feel ?
<CCCP> Phase4: :3
*Dken2021 hugs TheRainbowDash "hope you feel better"

<Pterodactyl> And then Luna flew around and did a sonic the hedgehog rainoom and Rarity put on a blue dress and beat up Fluttershy, but then Mario came in and played pokemon black and found a shiny pidgey and Pinkie thrrew it at the wall and siad "WHY U NO LOV ME" and Mario cried and punched Luigi.
<Cypresswolf> Phase4: I'll give 7 a spin now, to get it over with

<TheRainbowDash> pablez94: Umm, well, no headache, but violent coughing, cold chills, sore throat, nose is messed up(runny and I can't partially breathe)....
<Very_Silly_Filly> I love toast

<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz|SPAZ: If this becomes worse, then I definitely need to take some, but for right now, I'm ok.
<GLaDOS> Probably the same as usual just without the ponies.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Pinkies4thWall! (waves)

<GLaDOS> How long has everyone here been on BronyState?
<Litwick> Apparently there's an interview going on today between bronystate and Babble with the Bronies
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: just make sure you dont overexert yourself. It can get worse if you're fatigued real bad

<Dken2021> Onyxia 2pm est yea
<pablez94> TheRainbowDash: hope u'll feel better..

<Luffy> Hub stated what?
<Dken2021> who cares about a pony reference, aquabats still a good show to watch
<Luffy> TELL ME
<mitamaking> Hub's Facebook page should be a good source
<Sumica> 00,10exactly Dken2021
<EpicPwnTime> hi bronies
<aczumel> WELL THE HUB'S FACEBOOK PAGE SAID THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A PONY REFERENCE IN THIS EPISODE
<A11ectis__> Did EQD just get copared to FOX D:<
<Dken2021> allo EpicPwnTime
<TwiilightSparkle> Hello EpicPwnTime
<Sumica> 00,10they only said future ep on the facebook
<Ninjazz> Dken2021: Being a brony, I can tell you it help that two awesome shows interact in some way or another.

<mitamaking> Such a good art program
<Spindash> Even with no pony reference, Aquabats is still gold
<aczumel> LUFFY YOU JUST MISSED AQUABATS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I bet it was a subtle reference.
<Evil_Spike> Indeed
<WhatWhat> maybe the suprise was pilgrim boy being a changeling?
<FlareChaser> imma pause this for some Heavy heavy heavy metal.
<mitamaking> Korra>Aquabats, sorry
<aczumel> what is the name of this song?
<Ninjazz> Nittany_Discord: We need to go look for it later on YouTube.
<Dken2021> FlareChaser how heavy?
<Twi_Fi> It would make sense to just mention that ponies will be in a future episode so that bronies will tune in every week.
<Ninjazz> Or something.... I dunno it was a good episode.
<FlareChaser> Dken2021: heavy as moby dick
<GameTaco> Naturally.

<MI9000> hello :)
<Ninjazz> Nitram, welcome.
<Dken2021> Luffy http://lmgtfy.com/?q=desktop+ponies
<Twi_Fi> Desktop ponies do not work for me, either because I use a mac or because I am stupid.
<Dken2021> lali-ho MI9000
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile x Trixie. where is it...?
<Pederia> Try Wine
<AdamThePony1> I lft the room? Lies
<Luffy> FUCK, I don't know what pony I s- Oh god.. "Which pony should I taaaaake?".
<Ninjazz> FlareChaser: OTP?
<Pederia> Wine = Wine Is Not an Emulator
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Twi_Fi
<Luffy> Guys, what's yer favorite song?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01Trixie
<Dken2021> Luffy make sure to 0 all ponies first
<FlareChaser> Ninjazz: OTP.
<Ninjazz> I see.
<Twi_Fi> Pinkies4thWall, :)
<Pederia> lets Windows programs run on Mac and Linux
<Flutters> Luffy: all of them
<aczumel> so what WAS the pony reference in the aquabats episode?
<FnF> There wasn't one
<Luffy> Flutters, good idea.
<MI9000> i dont know what it was
<Ninjazz> You know what? I'll go look for it.
<FlareChaser> NO ONE TOUCHES COLGATE! NO ONE! :| ever......ever.....
<Sumica> 00,10did not see it but it could have been obscure
<ghostpolitics> It had to have been the parasprite
<Pinkies4thWall> Twi_Fi: you liek poniez. You're not stupid.
<Nitram> Who's streaming?
<Dken2021> can I pet colgate FlareChaser?
<EgrusDam> aczumel nothing, EQD is a stupid place
<Luffy> Wednesday, wednesday, it's in the middle of the week, wednseday..
<Twi_Fi> FlareChaser, but, how will I brush my teeth?
<FlareChaser> Dken2021: You can Brushie her :3
<Ninjazz> Could have been a "Derpy" style kinda thing.
<Flutters> Luffy, is that THE luffy the grat and powerful from tumblr?
<Dken2021> yay \:3/
<TheHoodyNinja> Yay my Fluttershys are out of the hospital :$
<Luffy> Huh?
<Luffy> What?
<Luffy> Derp?
<Pinkies4thWall> dat seapony lyra
<aczumel> but even the hub's facebook page said there was going to be a pony reference
<Flutters> i dunno
<Twi_Fi> Everypony! Keep cheese away from the Fluttershys!
<FlareChaser> http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=Brushie+Brushie#/d3cylz9 See? Brushie Brushie.
<EgrusDam> Hey Pinkies4thWall!
<aczumel> so it's not really EQD'S fault
<TheHoodyNinja> Twi_Fi you made them sick, not Flare
<Luffy> Anyways, I gotta go. I just bought "World War Z".
<GameTaco> Odds are, it was probably turning into fireworks, Pinkie-style. It just wasn't as blatant as "Broni-os". :P
<Luffy> I need to read it.
<Twi_Fi> :( I soooooo soooorrrrryyyy........
<TheHoodyNinja> From now on I shall feed them celery and peanut butter
<FnF> Not a chance, 'Taco
<RainbowAsh> Sumica, none of us saw it. It must be really well hidden if up to 170 people looking out for the reference missed it
<CCCP> bye!
<Ninjazz> Might have to wait a while for the smarter people of YouTube to inspect the new episode...
<Luffy> BAI EWYONE
<Dken2021> bai CCCP
<MI9000> i shall find it!!!!!!!!!!
<GameTaco> Eh, there's a chance. Just not a good one.
<Ninjazz> Cya CCCP. Take care.
<TheHoodyNinja> bai Luffy and CCCP
<MI9000> see ya later
<Sumica> 00,10aczumel they said future ep would have it they never said what or when
<Pederia> Shalom
<GameTaco> More likely, it was a background element on the television.
<Twi_Fi> Bye CCCP and Luffy.
<FnF> No, Sumica; There's no two ways to interpret the post
<RainbowAsh> Sumica, I checked their facebook page. They did talk about this episode
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah RainbowAsh but it was alot to look for who knows
<Twi_Fi> Ponies will be referenced in future episodes of MLP.
*Ray yawns
<FnF> It explicitly meant this one
<Dken2021> no wai!
<GameTaco> But I wouldn't worry about it. Not knowing what shoutout you're looking for isn't quite the same as "Derpy may or may not appear one or more times in this episode, feel free to find her."
<mitamaking> Twi_Fi: Actually season 3 is going to be about cows
<TheHoodyNinja> Twi_Fi: NO WAY!
<FnF> "Weird Al + a My Little Pony Friendship is Magic surprise = best episode ever of The Aquabats! Super Show!!"
<aczumel> here are the words from the hub's facebook page: Weird Al + a My Little Pony Friendship is Magic surprise = best episode ever of The Aquabats! Super Show!!
<Sumica> 00,10but my bet is it was the "parasprite thing"
<aczumel> and then it gives a preview of this episode
<RainbowAsh> Sumica, that bug didn't look like a parasprite, though
<Randomnerd> Hrm.
<TheHoodyNinja> I LIKE PONIES!
<aczumel> I'm starting to think that too
<Renard> I'm late. What was the surprise?
<TwiilightSparkle> Hello im back
<RainbowAsh> Renard, we have no clue.
*Randomnerd slowly realizes this fandom is so huge he'll never be able to consume all the worthwhile things it does.
<trollando> What's the name of this program?
<MI9000> does anypony know what that emerald thing is?
<Renard> Oh okay
<Sumica> 00,10guess we wait a bit to see if a folow up is done
<Pederia> doesn't look like the GIMP
<Sumica> 00,10I am sure there are bronys with recordings of the ep going over every fram as we speek
<GameTaco> It's probably something I'd catch if I weren't half-distracted by the chat.
<RankWinner> It's Paint Tool SAI Pederia
<bronycross> what am i watching?
<Sumica> 00,10Program is "SAI"
<Litwick> They actually DID make a brony reference. In a previous episode.
<mitamaking> That's right blame the chat
<trollando> ok
<Flutters> copy/paste is amgic
<MI9000> are you using a tablet
<xerxes> hi i just came here, is this photoshop?
<Litwick> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6wfLePQkw﻿ The reference was in a previous episode.
<FnF> If two hundred obsessed people specifically looking out for it can't spot it, it's not a "subtle" reference, but just simply a bad one
<RankWinner> Drawing without a tablet = o_O
<Sumica> 00,10Program is "SAI"
<Sumica> 00,10and yes Wrek uses a tablet
<Sumica> 00,10but not all the time
<RainbowAsh> Litwick, nice
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> and back...With coffee!
<RainbowAsh> Ok, we might have missed something like that
<Pederia> I think people would find it hard to do pixel art with a tablet
<Sumica> 00,10FnF i can say I was not looking for it
<aczumel> maybe hub got confused and thought the previous episode with the pony reference was this episodee
<Dances_With_Discord> Done with that Pinkie Pie Flashlight Mod :D it looks bad but hey I dont care
<MI9000> yeah mabye the episodes were mixed up
<FlareChaser> The Living Tombstone - Magic..... that is a awesome song... :3
<Pederia> I like Fly
<Twi_Fi> The engrossing drama that is aquabats distracted me from looking for pony references.
<RankWinner> Yes, that must be it(!)
<MI9000> so what happens now?
<aczumel> yeah even though OI didn't see the pony reference I erally enjoyed the show
<FnF> A hundred or two hundred, doesn't matter
<RankWinner> I just hope that people don't flip out over this...
<FnF> Ten would be enough to be statistically reliable
<FnF> Of course we won't
<Sumica> 00,10oh dont worry "we" will
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> what about fandom overreaction?
<GameTaco> Gear up for Derpygate 2.5?
<MI9000> so when is the next stream happening?
<d3rb> 2hrs
<RankWinner> Right now?
<Sumica> 00,10some whee some one is fliping tabels this very moment
<FnF> Exaggeration reactions happen when people care about something
<RankWinner> Ah, stream-stream
<Airpuff> Yay I've gotten two faves in two hours on my edit of the twilight picture! =D
<FnF> The AquaBats show can be a lot of fun, but not something anyone actually cares about
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> I'm used to that (thanks street fighter fans/SRK)
<d3rb> got a link Airpuff ?
<GameTaco> Exactly. It stands out just fine on its own.
<Airpuff> d3rb: Sure http://airpuff.deviantart.com/#/d4xxjtt
<Pederia> ohh
<Pederia> It's Chrysalis
<Sumica> 00,10no it's not aquabats that people are careing about it's where is my pony shoutout.
<RankWinner> Airpuff, you reminded me to check on mine and it's finally over 100 faves =D http://fav.me/d4xnc2c
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> oh, entitlement where it isnt due. got it.
<Pederia> and the thing was a magic spark
<d3rb> Airpuff....thats really good
<Sumica> 00,10keep in mind the whole reasion we even first started showing it was because you all requested we do so to see the pony shoutout
<Airpuff> Hehe It's not completely mine though. Just edited some parts..
<GameTaco> The hype over "pony shout outs" sounds just like was said in chat before, Hasbro/Hub probably planted it to get us to watch other shows during the post-season gap.
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> airpuff, that is wonderful.
<Airpuff> Thanks x)
<mitamaking> The Hub is evil now?
<Sumica> 00,10we keep showing it cause it's an amusing show mind you
<Airpuff> Be sure to watch the original >.<
<yifle1> I want to be honest now...................AQUABATS SUCKS
<GameTaco> Amusing is an understatement. :3
<aczumel> I think you guys should start playing aquabats regularly on here because it's a really cool show
<GameTaco> I thought they already did?
<FnF> But naturally
<RankWinner> Pff I was trying to stay away from that... crazy-ass.. I don't even know how to describe it
<MI9000> i find aquabats amusing
<Pederia> it's So Bad It's Good
<Pederia> on purpose
<Obsidian> I okay with it
<Airpuff> Pederia: ahaha xD
<diddutz> It's like Titanic II :3
<aczumel> I actually wanted to watch this show even before the pony refrences
<GameTaco> The only thing I find bad about it is that those commercial breaks got frighteningly long.
<Sumica> 00,10that's just US tv
<Airpuff> ... diddutz: ... dont make me imagine.. a titanic.. 2.... lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Titanic 3464: Ponies.
<GameTaco> Unless it only feels that way because Aquabats also keeps cutting to the shorts *within* the episode, including the fake ad.
<MI9000> Pederia exactly its just fun and pure cheesyness
<aczumel> are you guys going to continue to show the aquabats?
<aczumel> on saturday
<diddutz> Airpuff: Why imagine? there IS a Titanic II
<EgrusDam> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1947/ Rainbow Dash is so horny right now.
<Sumica> 00,10What sucks is I pay for hub to see those ads.
<Airpuff> ... What? It is? diddutz: ?!
<Twi_Fi> EgrusDam, I was worried for a sec there.
<diddutz> we watched it a month ago or so at MovieNight ^^
<Kandarihu> Would you prefer to pay 3 times as much for a version of The HUB that only advertises for it's own programs?
<Airpuff> ... diddutz: ... oh god why.. xDd
<Ninjazz> Ahhh movie night in 2 hours...
<EgrusDam> Twi_Fi, if I said it otherwise it would have ruined the joke :D
<Airpuff> I dont get how it's.. movie night.. wasnt there one yesterday?
<Airpuff> xD
<Sumica> 00,10I would rather not have ads on a service I am paying for
<Pederia> Euro Movie Night, I think
<yifle1> what movie will they be showing ?
<Sumica> 00,10we have 2 of them Airpuff
<Renard> Kandarihu, if I had to pay 3× as much, I at least would expect no ads at all.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: Welcome to America
<Airpuff> ô.o then i watched the us then..
<Ninjazz> I missed yesterdays.
<diddutz> Airpuff: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640571/
<Ninjazz> So i gotta watch Euro Brony Night.
<Kandarihu> Even if the costs of it's programming was derived ENTIRELY from cable subscribers, these shows only fill 22 minutes each half hour. The rest has to be filled with something.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Adverts are the law.
<FnF> Titanic II sounds a lot worse as an idea than the movie actually presents it as
<FnF> It's not a sequel
<Ninjazz> It is.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Very_Silly_Filly thanks, some how I think I have been here longer then you =p
<Litwick> Everyone quickly WMC that Aguirre movie. Why? It's BORING. And tries to educate you WHILE boring you.
<Airpuff> ......... diddutz: .... wow.. sounds.. terrible.. i donno.. it cant be a sequel.. i mean its just flashbacks or something right?
<FnF> The movie's literally about a ship called Titanic II
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: I haven't lived in America, ever :P
<Airpuff> lol
<WindWhistler> .........
<GarrettBrony> SUP
<Airpuff> Dont tell me it sinks...
<Litwick> Quick! Before Val logs back on!
<Dances_With_Discord> cya later Brony State meet ya in a couple of hours :D
<otakon> Litwick: it's NOT WMC material
<WindWhistler> Jealousy level.....rising....
<Airpuff> please.. dont tell me it sinks -.-
<GameTaco> I'm just saying, one of those commercial breaks felt like the length of a commercial break normally used for a show split into two 15-ish minute segments. Again, maybe just me. Not complaining about the length of the ads, just the perceived length of the show. I want more Aquabats. :3
<Pederia> I live in Canada
<Sumica> 00,10then how can you welcome me ou silly filly
<WindWhistler> Airpuff: What else?
<Pederia> we don't get the Hub
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm been in Britain my whole life, but I watch a lot of American sports like Nascar and Indycar ;)
<otakon> hiya Wrek|Observing, Sumica
<Airpuff> WindWhistler: wut?
<GarrettBrony> I live in Neighbraska
<diddutz> Airpuff: No they rebuild the Titanic a hundered years after the original sunk and guess what happens :3
<Obsidian> We need Gohosties for that movie again
<Pederia> but MLP airs on Treehouse TV
<Kandarihu> I don't know. There was a mod that made humor out of it. And then there was Seapony Lyra popping out of everyone's forehead.
<Ninjazz> otakon, welcome.
<Sumica> 00,10Well the one extra long break was to make up for there only being 3 breaks I guess
<WindWhistler> Airpuff: If it's called Titanic II, of COURSE it's gonna sink
<Obsidian> *Ghosties
<GarrettBrony> Ba dum ching
<GameTaco> Shooooo-by-doo.
<otakon> Very_Silly_Filly: the hell? I'm american and I loathe Nascar dear GOD is it boring
<Airpuff> diddutz: okei xD Good.. Woudl've been terrible if it had sunk just like the first one -.-
<TwiilightSparkle> Im back everypony
<otakon> wb TwiilightSparkle
<Very_Silly_Filly> The plate races are quite interesting
<Ninjazz> I still can't believe we didn't WMC Titanic 2.
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> wb TwiilightSparkle.
<Airpuff> Wb Twilight =P
<Dken2021> welcome back TwiilightSparkle
<Pederia> and they censored the word "loser"
<Very_Silly_Filly> But the others are pretty dull :s
<otakon> Ninjazz: I concur
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Ninjazz: because it was funny.
<Ninjazz> TwiilightSparkle, welcome...
<Cypresswolf> farthers I got was near the end of step 2 of upgrading - gathering files, settings, & programs - I have Error End that detects and cleans errors like that, ran a scan & tried again and got error code 0x80070020, now it wont upgrade at all
<Ninjazz> Yeah.
<Kandarihu> Really? I'm American and Nascar is one of the few sports I don't outright despise.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I kinda like it, the plate races are very exiting
<Litwick> Pederia: Wow. And I thought American censorship was ridiculous,
<Airpuff> Which movie are we watching btw??
<TwiilightSparkle> Hi Ninjazz...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sometimes more exiting than Formula 1
<Ninjazz> :)
<GarrettBrony> Cartoon Planet is Back on the Airwaves
<TheRandomkid321> bloody hell im tired.
<Airpuff> If i am allowed to ask o.o
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Monty Python and the Holy Grail is first.:)
<Litwick> Airpuff: Monty Python is the ONLY one worth staying for.
<Cypresswolf> I hate windows software...so much...-_-
<MI9000> monty python in like 3 hours
<otakon> Hey, has anyone seen UnfoundBug today?
<Very_Silly_Filly> What's the B film?
<otakon> MI9000: 2 hours
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Aquirre.
<MI9000> 2 hours
*TwiilightSparkle is done reading book
<Litwick> Very_Silly_Filly: A shitty one.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Unfoundbug hasn't been online all day
<GarrettBrony> Cypreswolf Fuck Yah, Ubuntu ftw
<Airpuff> TheRainbowDash: Omg i watched that yesterday xD I shouldnt have seen yesterday >.<
<Sumica> 00,10depends on how you define today
<Kandarihu> The sports I specifically hate are the ones that keep kids away from pop culture.
<MI9000> + 5 minuts
*TwiilightSparkle grabs another book
<Twi_Fi> Goodnight all!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Obsidian> The most boring movie ever made
<Ninjazz> If you really want another WMC... Watch Meet the Spartans... I'm serrious... That is by far the worse movie I ever paid for to see.
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Hahaha:D, wow...
<TwiilightSparkle> Bye Twi_Fi!
<TheRandomkid321> im gonna read.
<Ninjazz> Cya Twi_Fi
*TwiilightSparkle is reading

<Dken2021> laters Twi_Fi

<GarrettBrony> Cypresswolf Fuck Yah, Ubuntu ftw
<Pederia> but with vikings
<Pederia> bye
<MI9000> good byt Twi_fi
<SpringWonder> Watcha reading TwiilightSparkle?
<Kandarihu> "Hey kids, stop playing those video games and watching those videos and surfing the internet! Come out here and play some _____" and anything that commonly fits the underscore, I hate.
<Airpuff> xD
<TwiilightSparkle> SpringWonder: Its the last book of Daring Do.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi otakon
<GameTaco> Ahh, I see.
<Pederia> Blood of Beasts has horrible cinematography
<Sumica> 00,10copypasta is magic
<Ninjazz> Parents just don't use enough of the internet to understand it.
<Dken2021> of course
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pasta is tasty
<Airpuff> TwilightSparkle: Lend me all the Daring do books Twilight!!
<Cypresswolf> I bought windows 7 last SUMMER! Vista won't upgrade worth a crap
<otakon> Kandarihu: ugh the outdoors! Gardening is pointless, mowing the yard is pointless
<Ninjazz> Those who do are very cool or know too much.
<Pederia> the fire consists of animated .GIF files
<GameTaco> Nothin' wrong with airing some of the older Cartoon (Cartoon)s.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Vista is the shittest OS there is
<TwiilightSparkle> Daring Do And the Quest of the Ghostlies Jewel
<Very_Silly_Filly> I really wanna get XP for my laptop
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> otakon: not if you get fined for not mowing.
<Wrek|Observing> 05hey
<Very_Silly_Filly> Because it has Vista
<Dken2021> otakon but it makes the yard look clean
<Pederia> copypasted over the scene
<Cypresswolf> $200 for software that is friggan useless
<Obsidian> Hi Wrek
<Wrek|Observing> 05as long as it looks good
<Wrek|Observing> 05:P

<TheRandomkid321> im going to bed in a few mins. Bloody tired as buck.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Daring Do and the Daring Do.
<GameTaco> Every time I hear about the Cartoon Planet block, I immediately assume they're literally bringing back Cartoon Planet...
<Very_Silly_Filly> We do
<TwiilightSparkle> Hello Wrek|Observing
<Airpuff> Loved the episode with Rainbow Dash when she started reading Daring Do xD
<GameTaco> ...Is misread it as Captain Planet.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Makes the inspectors think *Ooh, this place isn't a shittole*
<Ninjazz> Daring Do does the do.
<dance1211> is the aquabats coming on?
<TwiilightSparkle> Yup
<kenne> someone pinged me before and i couldnt check becuase window crashed :/
<Dken2021> otakon ok then, be the one guy with snakes and stuff in the yard
<Kandarihu> Well, I understand mowing the lawn. It has to be mowed every week or 2 so that the grass doesn't get too long and become a breeding ground for snakes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aquabats already aired.
<Cobellanez> Hello everyone
<deadeagle> im going to assume this is wrek streaming
<TwiilightSparkle> dance1211: That ended an hour ago

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now you have to deal with Landbats.
<otakon> Shibakuzou_WallDives: I wonder why though? WHY is short grass so damn important? I takes time, gasoline and physical injury for a job that has absolutely no real point besides wasting time. And that's what the net is for
<GameTaco> It's been a half hour already? Yeesh, time flies in the livestream.
<TheRandomkid321> night everyone
<Airpuff> TheRandomkid321: Good night =P

<Ninjazz> Cya FlareChaser. Colgate is NOT best pony.
<Sumica> 00,10Some how I think hub just exploited all bronys and used them to get better rateings on a show
<Cobellanez> Later FlareChaser
<otakon> Kandarihu: eh not really. All you need a is a path out and a path in. I apologize if I sounded flippant.
<FlareChaser> Ninjazz: And thats your opinion, mine differs.

<GameTaco> Nothin' wrong with that. It's still a solid Saturday Morning schedule. Yes, yes, even with the Shortcake.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: Probably
<otakon> bye FlareChaser

<GameTaco> Also, today is/was supposed to have the third(?) Super Best Friends Forever short, right?

<yifle1> i hope it do
<otakon> R.I.P. Toonami and see you later Tom.
<Ninjazz> ^
<SpringWonder> I guess you could finally make a start on reading 'The Art of the To-Do list'. :$
<GameTaco> It's only natural to try to fuse it back into the Saturday Adult Swim block somehow.
<ReignOfComputer> Thanks!
<GarrettBrony> I didnt like that last gen of Toonami, IT was like ThOMas The Toonami Engine
<otakon> GameTaco: hell yes

<Kandarihu> 4 years in a row, Adult Swim failed to make their viewers laugh for April Fool's day. This time, they elicited something other than rage.
<DrGNs> Hey Ninjazz, WallDives, and TwiilightSparkle:
<GLaDOS> I use the neurotoxin key a lot
<Cypresswolf> I used to have a link to a video with Twilight staring of into space with Neverwood's Potatoes, Tomatoes, Gravy & Peas - but it got baleeted *yes that spelling is intentional*

*Ninjazz melts Nittany_Discord

<DrGNs> How'd you guys think Holy grail was?
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> GameTaco: this is true.

<Ninjazz> oh, man! SPACE GHOST
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Tom wasnt on SGCtC, was he?
<Dken2021> would a cup of lifenoodles help?
<GarrettBrony> No but he was connected to Moltar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Moltar did Toonami for a bit.
*otakon hits Nittany_Discord with liquid nitrogen
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> yep. and almost no one remembers.

*Nittany_Discord 11,01is a frozen puddle.
<Dken2021> moltar was like the first host right?
<GarrettBrony> yes
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> yep.
<otakon> I also rememeber that Moxy that hosted late night cartoons
<Ninjazz> What does SGCtC stand for?
<otakon> I think it was moxy
<Kandarihu> Moltar was hosting Toonami at the beginning. Then the made up Tom and the Absolution
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Space Ghost: Coast to Coast
*Obsidian hits Nittany_Discord's molten remains with a hammer

<Kandarihu> SGC2C was a real mind trip
<GameTaco> Moltar: Hosting and watching shows about heroic, model young women before it was cool.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Great show.
<trollando> Holy layers galore batman

<GarrettBrony> I was born in 1995 so i dont know that one
<otakon> the X-Men cartoon from the 90's was great
<Dken2021> yea, been watching ren and stimpy lately, as much weird and gross it is, it's kinda enjoying to watch, remind me of the internet
<yifle1> Storm and spider man has always been my favorit heroes
<Kandarihu> Since there are obviously people who never saw SGC2C, let me explain. It's basically an old 1960s superhero (Space Ghost) hosting a talk show, with his archnemeses supporting him, and guests who only appear on screens. And it was ABSURDLY FUNNY!
<Skylands> 10Shiro, yes?
<DrGNs> If that's the case I'll be NightCrawler
<otakon> it still hold up pretty good.
<WhatWhat> << oh criik! I havn't saved in over an hour!

<otakon> WhatWhat: SAVE DAMMIT DAVE!
<GarrettBrony> Thank for the Interwebs, Watching old show makes me feel like a true kid of the ninties
<otakon> wait............why did I type Dave?
<Ninjazz> Yes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SGC2C was made by Williams Street, who later did Sealab 2021 and ATHF.
<GameTaco> The idea, I guess, was that the special guests were actually prerecorded and the show just messed around with the footage. Most of the time, they outright ignored it. :P
<Ninjazz> I mean...
<Ninjazz> No.
<yifle1> I have sooo many great memoies from sailor moon
<WhatWhat> I'm having problems with my CPU. I should try re booting
<GarrettBrony> I m sorry otakon I m afraid I cant let you do that
<Ninjazz> First anime was DBZ for me.
<Obsidian> otakon: Dave sam it
<GarrettBrony> Ninjazz, same here
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> first anime was Mobile Suit Gundam.
<Ninjazz> Nice, GarrettBrony.
<yifle1> Even today i still watch sailor moon
<GameTaco> I wish I could remember Sailor Moon as well as I did then beyond the fact that I treated it like most "Bronies" probably do today.
<Kandarihu> The interviews were wierd because the producers would interview the guests ahead of time, and then depict Space Ghost asking them totally different questions.
<lollerguy> :3
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> with Bright Noa's british accent.
<GarrettBrony> Mah first Transformers was Armada
<Very_Silly_Filly> I thought the first anime was Astro boy?
<otakon> My first anime(though I didn't know it) was Voltron and the first movie I saw was Project A-Ko
<GameTaco> AKA watched in complete privacy in my room... >_>
<Dken2021> everyone in my neighborhood watch dbz like a drama show
<yifle1> im also making my own group transform videos
<Litwick> 1 hour until the interview!
<Ninjazz> DBZ was freakin awesome.
<MI9000> really only one hour?
<otakon> Dken2021: it is kind of a soap opera......except with fighting
<Obsidian> My first transformers was Beast Wars
<Kandarihu> First anime for me was technically Go Lion (Voltron). The anime that actually got me into anime was Sailor Moon.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Interview?
<EgrusDam> Yay, interview!
<Ninjazz> Interview?
<otakon> iNterview?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Beast was is probably one of the best transformers
<RainbowAsh> Ninjazz, DBZ was my entry into the world of anime
<Obsidian> Its today?

<Dken2021> otakon I know, it even had alot of cliffhangers

<Very_Silly_Filly> Then they wonder why
<MI9000> transformers prime is the best
<Obsidian> Tara Strong makes everything better
<otakon> Kandarihu: agreed, I also remember watching Macron 1 from f.m.e. which was actually TWO shows combined. It was also the first time I saw a guy blow himself up AND a funeral in a kids show. THEY MARKETED IT FOR KIDS!
<Dken2021> not much of a fan of transformers
<RainbowAsh> Ninjazz, cell was an awesome villain, but I always was most fond of the Freeza arc.

<GameTaco> "Ooh, holes. I bet I can swim through one of these."
<Very_Silly_Filly> Look good dude
<otakon> Shibakuzou_WallDives: well I said ONE of them. Tezuka is really the God of Manga at this point
<StarSwirlTheBearded> I Watched Moar Pokemon As A Kid And My Mom Kinda Judges Dragonballz As Something I Shouldn't Watch
<DrGNs> She seems anorexic 0___0
<Very_Silly_Filly> God, my grammar is terrible today
<Pterodactyl> One day in Equestria, Applejack was expodeing ponyville until Rarity done a sonic rainboom on her. But then Celestia woz sad because spider man married Pinkie Pie.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> A Least No ones Being A Grammar Nazi
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> oh god, not moar fanfic...
<Obsidian> A bony pony
<Very_Silly_Filly> Spiderman did what he wants
<GameTaco> Spider-Man: He does what he wants.
<cachi01> i dont think akira will die this year cause he is only 57 years old
<DrGNs> Shouldn't it Be Deadpool and Pinkie Pie?
<GarrettBrony> Spider Ham
<otakon> cachi01: well don't get too depressed my friend! he's only 57, and the Japanese on average are long lived. In good health he'll easily have another 30 years of bringing wonder to the world.
<cachi01> Eeyup exactly!
<GameTaco> Except show up for Dr. Connors' class. He gets so caught up in what he's doing, he forgets all about it.
<RainbowAsh> Pterodactyl, so, how is this non-sequitur shtick working out for you?
<cachi01> rice gives u lifelol
<StarSwirlTheBearded> I never really liked dragonballz
<GarrettBrony> DBQ
<otakon> cachi01: actually, there was a injoke in the Blue Dragon DS game about Toriyama leaving his legacy behind in a android. But I won't spoil it.
<Obsidian> Rice and fish. The food of immortals!
<StarSwirlTheBearded> i kinda liked anything my sister liked (She was corrupting mah mind)
<cachi01> otakon: lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<SpringWonder> Dragonflyz maximise!
<otakon> StarSwirlTheBearded: please tell me she's not one of those yaoi girls.
<RainbowAsh> Howdy do Everlasting_Joy
<Wrek|Observing> 05hey otakon!

<Everlasting_Joy> Later Airpuff.
<GameTaco> Children happened.
<cachi01> bye Airpuff
<RainbowAsh> Dial it up to 11!
<otakon> GarrettBrony: Z was meant I think as the final chapter........then GT happened
<otakon> Obsidian: 4 messages in 10 seconds gets you a kick
<Ninjazz> GT...
<otakon> blargh
<Obsidian> ohhh
<GameTaco> All I know about GT is that's a self-contained shark jump.
<yifle1> i grew up with GT
<rdibp> man i missed todays aquabats episode. how was it?
<StarSwirlTheBearded> I Dont really talk to her much, if i do she stares at me looking angry
<GameTaco> Very good, but it felt short.
<detour> Episode of Bardock...Still more canon than GT
<Ninjazz> rdibp: Really good actually.
<otakon> GameTaco: just barely self contained, also it had NO input from Toriyama
<RainbowAsh> rdibp, great, but rather lacking in pony
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> yifle1: I'm so sorry.
<rdibp> I heard there was a pony shout out in it. was there?
<StarSwirlTheBearded> I woke up at 9 but didn't get UP DARN IT
<yifle1> ?
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> that you had to grow up with GT.
<GarrettBrony> Plan 9
<derpy_pony> likety split?
<Pterodactyl> Another day in America, Fluttershy woz shooting Angel with her shotgun, but then Sonic came up and said " That's no good" and fllew away, Then happy Rainbow Dash fed her animal friends in hell.
<otakon> yifle1: you need REAL DBZ experience
<GameTaco> Seriously. It's like, the animé creators just kinda wanted to see how far they could take GT, and... Destroyed everything memorable about it.
<cachi01> Pterodactyl: mother of god..
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> thats like kids growing up with the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube era games.
<otakon> GameTaco: the main villains name is BABY
<yifle1> of course i also saw Dragon ball z
<otakon> brb
<GameTaco> Then, just to show how overboard they went, brought *all the villains back*... And promptly killed all of them again.
<cachi01> i was born 1998 n64 ps1 and dreamcast era
<Everlasting_Joy> Yay! More seapony Lyra.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> I once gave my sister a gameboy game that i got @ chritmas cuz i didn't have a system

<EgrusDam> Yay for arcades!
<GarrettBrony> Star Wrek is An Awsome parody series
<Bronysith> OF COURSE Wrek it looks awesome
<otakon> yifle1: nice......I never did beat that one. I've beaten nearly all the other RE after it though
<Ninjazz> Almost seemlessly.

<cachi01> i have beaten all RE except for 1 and 3
<yifle1> it fun to blow the zombis heads of
<Kandarihu> I was a child during the NES era, and it was somewhat socially acceptable for me to play video games. The SNES came out at around the time in my life when I was becoming a teenager and I was expected to drop that in favor of TEENAGE things like skateboarding and serious pursuit of sports.
<Very_Silly_Filly> The Carapace seems fine
<ReignOfComputer> Any mod/admin I can PM to ask about permission for a post?
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> dat Baseball stars, battletoads, Punch-out, Metal Slug, ST, Xevious...

<Everlasting_Joy> Shibakuzou_WallDives Kill them! Kill them with fire and holy water!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Besides, a simple bowshot and they are DED

<Dances_With_Discord> brb hungry :D
<DrGNs> Anybody know where to locate the Android in Fallout 3 ?
<FlareChaser> Back, im back.
<GarrettBrony> brb hungry
<Dken2021> Pterodactyl are you reciting a fanfic?
<Kandarihu> The thing is, I have a kind-of cool mom. I don't really enjoy the M-Ratedness of M-rated games. But I tolerate them well enough.
<Chrysalis> otakon shes also hawt
<Chrysalis> :P
<yifle1> Big Mac is just going around my computer screen
<yankee> yes hes in the ship place
<cachi01> skulltulas: right when yiu think you got them they fucking turn around

<Shibakuzou_WallDives> but wall masters are sneakin in yo temples, snatchin yo people up...
<otakon> Chrysalis: you up for a Gold run and a SIlver or two before the movies?
<yankee> can't remeber whats it called
<ReignOfComputer> PMing you, thanks.
<GameTaco> The Great and Powerful Trixalys is the most beautiful and talented equinoid in all of Equestria.
<DrGNs> I personally don't find holes in the body attractive, but Fangs......
<Kandarihu> I'm into Role Playing Games. And while mom can't game her way out of a paper bag, she enjoys the OSTs of the games I play.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> I Once played A MATURE GAME ON A CRUSE SHIP WITH OTHER PEOPLE UNDER 18
<StarSwirlTheBearded> COME ON MOM
<Chrysalis> otakon sure, should be on for a bit before avengers
<Very_Silly_Filly> If she's a changling, why can't she change into a motorised bar of soap.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> SRSLY?
<Very_Silly_Filly> She would get LOADS of wub then
<StarSwirlTheBearded> Epic wub time
<Obsidian> Today's episode combinatin on the Hub are the Discord two parter
<RankWinner> http://derpy.me/3XdRM and people said the LHC was a waste of money :D
<GameTaco> If she wants wub, she just needs to ask Vinyl.
<otakon> Very_Silly_Filly: a motorized bar of soap? :/
<DrGNs> Soap?
<Vinyl> yep
<otakon> GameTaco: Vinyl HAS the wubs
<Very_Silly_Filly> otakon: If you were here half an hour ago, you'd know what I mean
<yifle1> My psp is almost 3 years old now
<StarSwirlTheBearded> LHC?
<StarSwirlTheBearded> whats that
<Vinyl> yep
<StarSwirlTheBearded> Squee
<otakon> Largh Hadron Collider
<cachi01> yifle1: mine 5 if my brother hadnt sell it
<Pterodactyl> Then Fluttershy said hi to Mario, but Mario threw his hat at Pinkie, and Rarity cried for no reason, this angered batman and he used his mega chin to beat up Braeburn.
<GameTaco> ...Or transform into Vinyl. I guess that works too.
<Flutters> hey guys
<yifle1> ok
<storm> hi
<RankWinner> The Large Hadron Collider? Does nobody watch the news anymore :|
<Very_Silly_Filly> I got my PSP release day
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> hi Flutters.
<otakon> its basically a atom smasher StarSwirlTheBearded
<cachi01> hi storm
<Ninjazz> Flutters, welcome.
<GameTaco> I'm sure the wubs are able to be transmitted.
<otakon> RankWinner: kids in here, remember that
*StarSwirlTheBearded Gets Evil Thoughts
<Dken2021> allo storm
<yifle1> the only thing i have replaced in my psp is the battery
<SpringWonder> Maybe the LHC will turn us all into ponies later this year...
<cachi01> RankWinner: THE BEST IDEA EVER xdddd
<otakon> StarSwirlTheBearded: no you can't use it as a doomsday weapon
<Very_Silly_Filly> I got a new screen protector, and that's about it.
<Chrysalis> otakon who else is joinin
<Flutters> wait crap 7 zip is murdering my cpu
<StarSwirlTheBearded> What if i cut off one end?
<RankWinner> otakon: Depends on your defenition of a kid =P I was following it's progress since I was 13
<Dken2021> LHC? you talking about that thing that makes anti-matter?
<cachi01> guys did you knew there is a large hadron collider in scribblenauts?????????????
<StarSwirlTheBearded> then it wounnd be a double cannon
<yifle1> My psp is like a friend for me
<otakon> Chrysalis: I don't know, ccouldn't get a hold of kenne or RX yet.
<kenne> otakon: what is it?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't go on my PSP anymore, I might sell it
<Very_Silly_Filly> I only play on my 3DS and PC nowadays
<Blue_Leaf> This is STILL on!?!?
<otakon> kenne: you up for a Gold to extraction?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01pets Chrysalis
<kenne> ughhhh
<RankWinner> Simple concept behing the LHC, smash things together and see what's inside.
<GameTaco> <3
<Chrysalis> :)
<Dken2021> funny story, I gave my PSP away like a idiot
<kenne> otakon: idk
<otakon> Blue_Leaf: yes, it'll be over soon
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> I only have my old DS.
<Blue_Leaf> Yay!
<StarSwirlTheBearded> im trying to sell mah ps2 CUZ MY DAD TRIED TO "FIX" SOME OF THE WIRES
<otakon> kenne: come on man! be decisive dammit!
<TheRainbowDash> (hugs Chrysalis too, but has an evil face right behing her eyes)
<RainbowAsh> StarSwirlTheBearded, I guess if it wasn't buried in the ground and you would shoot the particle ray on someone, it might do some damage.
<yifle1> What do you guys think about the psvita
<Chezne> is that Sea Pony Lyra available somewhere?
<Very_Silly_Filly> My old DS was fatally broken a month ago
<cachi01> Dken2021: fun story i did that but with my ps1 and gameboy advance.... i cry for them every night
<otakon> StarSwirlTheBearded: wait..........your dad tried to FIX it?
*Chrysalis hugs TheRainbowDash
<kenne> otakon: idk maybe, are we playing now
<Very_Silly_Filly> yifle1: I kinda find it pointless all it has is better graphics.
<TheRainbowDash> (hehe, Chrysalis doesn't know...)
<Blue_Leaf> Rainbow, I need a hug. ),:
<Chrysalis> ?
<Blue_Leaf> :,(*
<Dken2021> cachi01 did you give it to a classmate for free?
<yifle1> To me its just some garbitch
<TheRainbowDash> (hugs Blue_Leaf insanely hard)
<Blue_Leaf> UGH.
<cachi01> Dken2021: to my cousin
<Blue_Leaf> -Is squeezed-
<Very_Silly_Filly> They havent changed anything in it from the last PSP
<RankWinner> Wrek needs to start his own radio station, I have yet to hear a song I dislike.
<Blue_Leaf> -Eyes bulge-
<Very_Silly_Filly> Only it's graphics and size
<storm> :D
<StarSwirlTheBearded> Yturns out it was the tvs auxillery so HE DIDN'T NEED TO CUT IT OFF *RAGE FACE*
<DrGNs> I was thinking for an episode, the mane 6 or spike himself is somehow transported to an evil residents area where previous villains all gather to create evil plans and relax from their defeat, And while in that area the mane 6, (or Spike) have to disguise themselves while also trying to escape and return back home before terroized by their former villains, What do you think?
<otakon> yifle1: it's overpriced as hell with proprietary memory cards and a small library. Plus you have to PAY to play any old PSP games you have that you want to play on the Vita. I'd wait 6 months for more releases and a price drop.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I would agree, if Wrek|Observing didn't have any wubstep
<Blue_Leaf> I'm sorry.
*StarSwirlTheBearded Not sure if like
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm not getting it full stop, I'm happy with my 3DS
<cachi01> yeah and then EL CHAPULIN COLORADO!! comes and saves the day
<Ninjazz> Just look at how lively this chat is. :)
<yifle1> otakon THATS RIGHT BROHOOF /)
<Blue_Leaf> -Le poofs once again-
<otakon> DrGNs: I had an idea like that. but the only real villains are Discord and Chrysalis.
<kenne> otakon: are we doing it now
<Magic> damn who ever doin the pic it looks real
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> has anyone played 9 hours 9 persons 9 doors?

<Very_Silly_Filly> Goldeneye is BRILLIANT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA are Orwellian, so they own the servers and run them like parents.
<Very_Silly_Filly> For n64

<RankWinner> I think all PC gamers have a inherant dislike for Ubisoft
<mitamaking> Nittany_Discord: Lollipop Chainsaw
<Obsidian> Yes
<GameTaco> Not yet. Maybe next year.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*shrug*
<Very_Silly_Filly> The only games released on it nowadays are crap oneds
<StarSwirlTheBearded> For englend james?
<RankWinner> I loathe most Ubisoft PC ports. The DRM Ubisoft has is the most draconian crap ever made
<StarSwirlTheBearded> no, for me
<mitamaking> I wanted that game beofre the bronies did(Suda 51 fan)
<Archeoptryx> After that Luna exploded like a shark and Then Fluttershy cried for no reason, but then Richard III came in and Henry Tudor woz like " NO U" and explosions
<Very_Silly_Filly> They are doing 3DS and WiiU stuff now
<StarSwirlTheBearded> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> last story on the wii is coming soon, isnt it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I haven't seen an interesting game in years (which hasn't been ruined by publisher greed).
<GameTaco> I feel like this year's E3 is going to be awesome, but I say that about all of them... And last year's was the only one that I kinda enjoyed.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> Aplot
<Derpy_Doo> sup
<yifle1> Very_Silly_Filly exatly
<mitamaking> Xenoblade Chronicles just came out, that is good
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Torchlight series
<Espeon> :3
<cachi01> guys have you seen the portal 2 second dlc trailer?? THERE IS AN EASTER EGG OF MEET THE PYRO!!!!!!!!!!
<yifle1> the old games are still best
<Umbreon> :P
<Ninjazz> Minecraft.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe.
<Very_Silly_Filly> The only game I think of where the devs actually CARE about their customersa
<yifle1> gta san andreas
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Daikatana is best shooter.
<Espeon> Sensitive fur indeed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Old games are better. You have more ownership of those.
*Shibakuzou_WallDives *trollface*
<cachi01> LOZ:OOT is best game EVER EVER FOREVER EVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
<yifle1> harry potter for ps1
<Vinyl> I'm back everypony :)]
<StarSwirlTheBearded> Who thinks the entrence of 007 in goldeneye is the best- sorry i didn't knock
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They won't be useless when the DRM servers go down.
<RankWinner> Nittany_Discord: Tribes: Ascend, a few dozen indie games, GTA, indie games, PlanetSide 2, indie games.
<cachi01> yifle1: i love tht one xd
<Very_Silly_Filly> Torchlight 2 will literally buy it, do what the fuck you want with it, they don't care
<gold> .............
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<Ninjazz> Vinyl, welcome.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm being general.
<Obsidian> Welcome Back Vinyl
<FlareChaser> cachi01: NOPE. the best game ever is.... yeah nevermind...
<RankWinner> Ah
<Bronysith> cachi01 i disagree i think its an amazing game and one of my favorites but i have to say CRONO TRIGGER is the best game ever
<Archeoptryx> The queen of the changelings, Chrysalis, is the primary antagonist featured in A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1 and Part 2. She is a shapeshifter who took on the form of Princess Cadance in order to invade Canterlot by taking Cadance's place and render her husband-to-be, Shining Armor, unable to perform his duties as Captain of the Royal Guard.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> ive had only hp games for the cpu
<yifle1> they are the my most memorable games i know
*mitamaking 's favorite game is Kingdom Hearts 1
<NightSwift> i like ff3
<GameTaco> Sounds (reads?) good.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like games. I just hate how my hobby has been strip-mined by a greedy few.
<Ninjazz> :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, the copyright BS.
<cachi01> Bronysith: i havent played chrono triger lol
<Dances_With_Discord> Dat blending
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> My favorite RPG is Phantasy Star IV.
<Ninjazz> Oh come on movie night... hurry up.
<Bronysith> R.I.P dio
<RankWinner> Aw yeah <3 this song
<EgrusDam> Bronysith, how about Live-A-Live?
<Acleps> Is there going to be something in place of the usual new pony episode, like old episodes etc...?
<StarSwirlTheBearded> The only thing me and my bro did at my grandparents house was play hp
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I still like games though.
<cachi01> mitamaking: brohoof (\ one of my fave games is the kingdom hearts series :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And play them frequently.
<Derpy_Doo> :D
<Dances_With_Discord> Like the Ubisoft sign up online to play a singleplayer game yeah that sucks
<Bronysith> cachio01 try it out its so much better than ff6 or 7 get a snes emulator
<A11ectis> Are there any decent turn-based RPG's for the PC that are recent?
<AlienWarhead> are we still streaming the hub at 1 pm EST
<Derpy_Doo> :P
<yifle1> AHH harry potter ps1 i miss you games
<SpringWonder> Anno 2070 looks good though...
<Umbreon> mm
<Bronysith> A11ectic no
<EgrusDam> HOLY DIVER
<RankWinner> Don't forget the Ubisoft "If our servers are down you can't play" thing
<cachi01> BETTER THAN FF7??
<RankWinner> That's really helpfull.
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> but no one has ever played it...
<mitamaking> Ubisoft is going to be in trouble soon I think, Assassain's Creed is being milked to oblivion, and if the Rabbids show flops they will be in trouble
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anno 2070 had bad DRM.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I've never liked Ubisoft
<RankWinner> I still have Anno... something or other, the one before 2070
<cachi01> i really expected a december 21 release for AC3
<pony_6876> There gonna be some sort of episode stream today?
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord Bad as in Easy to break?
<Very_Silly_Filly> arseassins creed is retardly unfair sometimes
<Bronysith> cachi01 dont worry i still love ff7 but theres something about crono trigger
<StarSwirlTheBearded> nick is really milking Fred O____O 2 movies? a series?
<Acleps> mitamaking: I never thought about that... But it's very true
<Dances_With_Discord> They made a show about the Rabbids 0_0
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't mind Ubisoft until they announced their DRM.
<RankWinner> I've never been able to play it because my save got corrupted and now I can't log in. Ubisoft Support basically = "Buy the game again"
<StarSwirlTheBearded> drm?
<Wrek|Observing> 05pony_6841 there's BMN in a little while
<CrimsonPhoenix> duuuuuude
<Dken2021> digital right management StarSwirlTheBearded
*StarSwirlTheBearded feels like a noob
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wrek
<CrimsonPhoenix> just wow
<Dken2021> *rights
<cachi01> guys have you seen the trailer for KARA????
<RankWinner> DRM = Digital (or Data by some odd people) Rights Managment.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GarrettBrony: Bad as in "changing hardware counts as an activation."
<yifle1> lets not forget syphon filter ps1
<StarSwirlTheBearded> kay
<Acleps> I hate how they just change the surroundings and add a few more weapons to the assassins creed series, and then it's a new game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubi DRM is very bad.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it doesn't work.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ubisoft is bad
<Wrek|Observing> 05steam DRM is tolerable
<cachi01> Acleps: it has an amazing stryline
<Very_Silly_Filly> Imo
<StarSwirlTheBearded> out of curiousity is there a pony ep today?
<Wrek|Observing> 05if they only workedo ut their issues >.>
<Ninjazz> Ubisoft hates PC gamers.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like Steam.
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> StarSwirlTheBearded: probably not, outside of BRM.
<Magic> should be
<RankWinner> Ubisoft puts horrid DRM in that screws all legit players over and rewards pirates. Then they wonder why their games get pirated.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's been slow for one times.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> D:
<Very_Silly_Filly> Steam DRM works pretty well most of the time, slow, but yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*time
<Wrek|Observing> 05StarSwirlTheBearded: season 2 is over so... no new ep. but during BMN 2 user selected episodes will be shown
<Acleps> cahci01: Well...thats true, but every time I finish one of the games I feel like it was a ripoff of the previous one
<StarSwirlTheBearded> What O_______________O
<GarrettBrony> DRM = Dick Raping Madness in UBi's Case
<StarSwirlTheBearded> NOOOOOOOOOO
<StarSwirlTheBearded> HOW I MISS THAT
<RankWinner> I had SO MUCH FUN with From Dust
<Very_Silly_Filly> Caps
<StarSwirlTheBearded> TO TEH INTERNETZ
<Magic> wat is euro movie night
<StarSwirlTheBearded> BYE
<Very_Silly_Filly> Mind the caps
<mitamaking> I'm looking at that map of the people who saw season 2's finale here, I'm not on it
<RankWinner> Bought the game, couldn't play it and I had to pirate to play the game I just bought.
<GameTaco> Things might be changing for Steam soon. First Ys: Oath (with Ys Origins on the way), and now, a one-woman developed visual novel.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let's not forget that Ubi has lied about DRM.
<Very_Silly_Filly> <Minimod apparently =P*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And got away with it.
<cachi01> RankWinner: i love to kill my villagers XD
<Acleps> Magic: Same as friday movie night, but earlier
<GameTaco> This makes me feel all warm and fluffy inside.
<CrimsonPhoenix> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1335631251159.jpg
<Magic> wat movies
<GameTaco> Oh wait, that's just Sweetie Belle.
<RankWinner> Yep Nittany_Discord, that's what they did with From Dust. "Only steam DRM." Nope......
<cachi01> shrek song?
<MadSurge> That map :D BRONIES ARE CONQUERING THE WORLD
<GarrettBrony> Magic is your other nick name Friendship?
<Everlasting_Joy> Magic, they replay Friday, but for the Eurobronies who would otherwise be up at 1-6am in the morning.
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix sweet
<Viri> 14Pokémon TCG <3 memories
<Acleps> RankWinner: Well at least you can feel that you did the right thing
<Everlasting_Joy> You can still attend the Euroshow if you miss Friday. They don't care :).
<Magic> oh
<Magic> ok
<Viri> 14when I will move I swear I'm going to try to find all the Neo expansion sets :D
<RankWinner> Yep, my -albeit quite warped- concience is the only thing stopping me from just pirating all Ubisoft games out of spite.
<cachi01> tamales oaxaqueñooooooooooooooos
<Acleps> Everlasting_Joy: I'm usually here for both :)
<Triple> 8 mintues?
<mitamaking> The map proves we need an Asian movie night
<Acleps> Triple: and an hour
<MysteryPony> mitamaking: where do i find this map?
<Litwick> welp, I'm back.,
<Triple> lyra lol
<Triple> XD
<pony_300> Asian movie night? Like kungfu movies?
<CCCP> :(
<Everlasting_Joy> Acleps :). I can't attend both, so I show up for Friday.
<Dken2021> welcome back Litwick
<mitamaking> It's a link on the newsletter or http://ponychat.net/2012-04-21_map.html
<Obsidian> Welcome back Litwick
<RankWinner> I think most bronies are in the west because of the more depressing lifestyle, places like Japan or Korea (*cough* ignoring China) are quite cheery.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If you pirate, you'll just be part of the problem (and made-up statistics publishers use to justify bad business practices).
<cowvarkian> I still want disney movie night...
<GarrettBrony> CCCP :)
<yifle1> i wonder what kind of episode there is in season 3
<Haeleus> so is SAI paintTool any different from adobe Illustrator?
<CCCP> :( GarrettBrony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course, the only way to own a game now is to pirate it.
<mitamaking> Season 3 is all about cows
<Magic> Garrett>my full nickname is magic blade
<RankWinner> Problem? The Witcher 2 used litteraly no DRM and they did fine in sales.
<Very_Silly_Filly> SAI IS adobe illustraot
<Wrek|Observing> 05Haeleus: yes very much on funtemental levels
<cachi01> RankWinner: being a brony means u are depressed? O_o
<Wrek|Observing> 05Very_Silly_Filly: no.
<Acleps> Everlasting_Joy: I'm usually here on fridays because of the chat, and if I get too tired I'll just go to sleep. On saturdays I watch both movies fully
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh really? :s
<RankWinner> cachi01: No, it's just that most people (and you can see this in the brony survey) watch because it cheers them up
<GarrettBrony> @Wrek here did you get this playlist?
<yifle1> i hope there will be a episode about big macintosh and doctor whooves
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wait, what...shockwave adobe illustrator... confuzzled*
<Haeleus> ah ok, was wondering if I should try out SAI specifically
<CCCP> :C
<cachi01> ohh ok O_o
<pony_300> honestly I'm not touching any game that has DRM in it; I like to play offline sometimes. Reason I didn't buy Final Fight DLC from capcom, despite my desire for some mike haggar HUURRRAAGGH!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Witcher 2 had piracy problems, but no different than DRM'ed titles.
<Acleps> RankWinner: For me it's just a side effect of the show :)
<mitamaking> A Doctor Whooves episode would rock but the rights issues are too much I think
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<MysteryPony> My god im not on the map!!!! maybe im a ai simulating the ecperice of watching bronystate????
<Cookie-Cutter> It would be difficult for them to do a Doctor Whooves, copyriht with Doctor Who and such
<yifle1> i hate copyright
<Archeoptryx> One day Fluttershy beat up Big Mac, but then Mario threw his hat at Applejack but she fireed her lazer and explode Mario and luigi woz like "NOOOOOOO"
<GarrettBrony> There is a rumor we might be getting a Derpy Episode
*CCCP is sad
*cowvarkian is a pirate yar har fiddle dee dee... but Ive bought a helluva lot more...
<RankWinner> Exactly Nittany, it shows that DRM makes litteraly no difference. Well, it makes a difference in that you might get fewer sales because of it.
<Everlasting_Joy> Even if The Dr. Who website as acknowledged us.
<Very_Silly_Filly> That rumour is most likely false
<Cookie-Cutter> Maybe they could put a small teaser like "We know!!!" about him being the Doctor
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01DRM is an investor confidence-booster.
*GarrettBrony glomps CCCP to cheer him up
<mitamaking> I don't want a Derpy episode, unless it is about Dr. Whooves
<Acleps> yifle1: It would suck to be a maker of media if there was no copyright :S
<sonicrainboomer259> chances are,thier false as hell
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's also game companies not thinking differently.
<GameTaco> I won't believe any rumors about the next season until I heard it from the pony's mouth.
<Everlasting_Joy> Considering the controversy she generated, a Derpy episode sounds very unlikely.
<CCCP> GarrettBrony:
<yifle1> an derpy episode would rock she just have to me derped 6_9
<CCCP> :(
<Randomnerd> Mmm.
<victor> wait no episods
<Randomnerd> We've got months to go.
<yifle1> i know
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still wanting to control their product.
<mitamaking> GameTaco: I would believe ponies talking to me too
<cowvarkian> Nittany, arent you a cook?
<RankWinner> Shareholders = "Nobodyu will steel our gamez! DRM AWAY!" *DRM then gets cracked in a few days or even before the game is released*
<cachi01> WHY ARE PEOPLE CONNECTED IN THE MIDDLEOF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN O_o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<cowvarkian> ok
<Wrek|Observing> 05gona grab a bite
<cowvarkian> someone else then
<Ninjazz> cachi01: That's me. Nice to meet you.
<Acleps> I wonder how much people will join soon in anticipation for a new episode :D
<Obsidian> Later Wrek|Observing
<Cookie-Cutter> Oh heck yes, a Derpy origins episode. Maybe we can learn how she got her cutie mark XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lemme link to a good read about copyrights.
<cachi01> lol Ninjazz how do u do that??
<Rallinale> although season 2 has ended, will you still be streaming the episodes?
<Wrek|Observing> 05so far so good
<Ninjazz> cachi01: Islands.
<mitamaking> Copyright is not evil, DRM is
<GarrettBrony> CopyRights sux
<Dken2021> Acleps perhaps alot
<pony_300> what's the name of this song?
<RankWinner> Argh I forgot the name of that anti-copyright/drm 'religion'....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.copyrightreform.eu/sites/copyrightreform.eu/files/The_Case_for_Copyright_Reform.pdf
<sonicrainboomer259> can we survive?probably. we will be revived in a few months with season 3 anyhow...
<Wrek|Observing> 05Rallinale: we stream episodes every BMN
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01 On the surface, some IP addresses will reroute someone to weird places for security purposes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kopimism?
<GarrettBrony> Creative Common ftw
<cachi01> oooooohhhhhh the red dots might make me not see it Ninjazz lol
<RankWinner> That's the one
<sonicrainboomer259> KONY 2012
<cachi01> Everlasting_Joy: ok
<Ninjazz> cachi01: :D
<mitamaking> I wish we watched Return to Harmony though, it is my fav 2-parter
<GarrettBrony> PONY 2012
<cowvarkian> Kony for president 2012
<Acleps> :D
<sonicrainboomer259> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll vote Kony in.
<Cookie-Cutter> oh thats a good site, I had to go there to prove copying names from a published book was illegal >.> people can be so retarded
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01: So if you're using an ISP in Chicago, tracing it might put you in Japan.
<Sundaysmile> PONY 2012
<cachi01> lol USA and mexico are filled with red dots xDDD
<GarrettBrony> Lauren Faust for president 2012
<Obsidian> Chat is gettingpolitical all of a suddeb
<Obsidian> *Sudden
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love how uploading a cover of a song is considered copyright infringement on Youtube.
<Everlasting_Joy> GarrettBrony: Do you honestly think she would want that job?
<MadSurge> cahi01 and Europe too :D
<cowvarkian> Kermit the frog for 2012
<Litwick> JIMMY RUSSELS 2013
<mitamaking> Saying _____ for president is not political
<RankWinner> Nittany, I still remember one of my test papers having a "Redacted due to copyright" thing on half of the images in it xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A cover of a song...
<glennglog22> hi
<GarrettBrony> no i dont think so
<Acleps> Obsidian: I hate politics
<CCCP> Litwick: lol
<yifle1> twilight sparkle 2012
<Dken2021> really? a cover?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Litwick> AND NO. I do not mean 2012.
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord for president 2012
<Dken2021> *sigh*
<Everlasting_Joy> A'ight, I need to go. I'll be back in due time, this I promise.
<glennglog22> hi
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A friend of mine couldn't upload song covers because they were shot down by YT's copyright system.
<Dken2021> allo glennglog22
<cowvarkian> Luna for president 2012
<mitamaking> Oh is the picture done?
<Umbreon> gotta collect them all?
<RankWinner> Did Dabu find out why his YouTube account was banned in the end? I forgot to check up on that
<Litwick> How about we just burn the White House AND Congress down> With tem inside.
<Mario> Hi
<GarrettBrony> Luna is already co-prez
<stallion1> wow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I've known of cases where videos of song covers were copyright-claimed.
<sonicrainboomer259> pinkie pie for president 2012-end of time
<mitamaking> Litwick: that's murder
<Magic> ill vote for twilight
<MadSurge> Hi Mario
<cowvarkian> and sortof... bad?
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord Creative Commons FTW
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hell, videos under fair-use have been taken down.
<Ninjazz> Litwick: That can get you in trouble for just saying that.
<stallion1> thats very awesome
<yifle1> :D
<cowvarkian> hooray for treason
<stallion1> suuper awesome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the user has to go through a process to get them back up.
<Acleps> On YouTube most owners of copyrighted material decide to profit from other's postin their content: they add commercials and get half of the income :)
<Viri> 14YES :D
<GarrettBrony> Hooray fro CC-BY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More than what it takes to make the copyright claim in the first place.
<mitamaking> I really like her mane
<RankWinner> Screw the US and their low-as-hell taxes. Paying like 8% and I have to pay 20% -__-
<cowvarkian> if that new bill was up, im sure most all of americans would be in jail right now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can go spoof a copyright on any YT video right now and get away with it.
<sonicrainboomer259> is this the Queen of "insert name here"???
<stallion1> ??
<GarrettBrony> Queen of the changlings
<GameTaco> Love that hair.
<MadSurge> Is it time for the interview yet?
<Ninjazz> ^
<sonicrainboomer259> right,forgot 6_9

<mitamaking> Hard to believe that was done on a computer
<Dken2021> MadSurge that at 4pm est
<EasyQuest> Queen Chrysalis
<MadSurge> :O
<GameTaco> ...And Lyra.
<Cookie-Cutter> cowvarkian: You mean go to jail for not paying he taxes? *is dumb O#O*
<RankWinner> To be honest I wanted some of those bills to go through just to watch the US internet/infrastructure get destroyed. It would have been a interesting show of power.
<Acleps> Imagine if one of the big owners of copyrights decided to sue everyone who violated their coprights..._S
<Acleps> _S*

<Treehugger> No Return of Harmony?
<GarrettBrony> Whos interviewing Who
<GameTaco> No Lyra. That's not cheese.

<GameTaco> She needs those to stand.
<stallion1> its neeew
<Pinkies4thWall> dat GameTaco
<GameTaco> <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't want these bills to go throught.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*through
<Dken2021> y'know, it would be a whole lot easier if the US government updated their laws, but no, republicans want to keep it that way cause our forefathers "wanted it this way"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They'll create a corporate police state.
<RankWinner> Don't worry, if they do then... :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Worse than now.
<Litwick> How about we start a revolution.
<RankWinner> It would never get that far
<cachi01> i still want mayonnaise as an instrument...........
<stallion1> yes
<cachi01> Litwick: hunger games
<GarrettBrony> CISPA: Craping Internet Strangling Pissing Act
<LordCelestia> 0,5Revolutions are impossible these days in big countries like the US.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the US will get the right to police the internet for the entire world.
<Acleps> I'd love to see the creator making all the layers invisible, and then making them visible one by one :D
<Dances_With_Discord> The DMC is good enough we dont need more bills for internet copyright *shrugs* :p
<AlienWarhead> Later and remember no Hateing
<Umbreon> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The DMCA is bad enough.
<RankWinner> You'd think that. The internet would help a lot
<Magic> yes litwick
<AlienWarhead> Love and tolerate
<LordCelestia> 0,5Our army is too powerful. We wouldnt stand a chance (assuming we're on the revolutionary side)
<Cookie-Cutter> >.> They need to go read the history books and stop making stupid mistakes America has done in the past
<Vinyl> No
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Then Pro-IP came.
<xXSpikeMLPXx> why are we all here
<Dken2021> LordCelestia true
<Litwick> Love and tolerate gets you nowhere: you must fight for what you beleive in.
<GarrettBrony> CISPA is 21st century's Prohibiton and I am one of its bootlegers
<RankWinner> I doubt most of the US army would actually turn against the citizens
<LordCelestia> 0,5xXSpikeMLPXx Saturday pony streams aren't the only thing we do
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know.
<Cookie-Cutter> If it came to the point of revolution I think a lot of people in the Military wouldn't fight. They at LEAST respect people
<Pinkies4thWall> RankWinner: ever heard of Martial Law?
<Kandarihu> No HUB stream?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Well while they wouldnt want to turn on us
<Litwick> The USA is now officially turning into North Korea.
<RankWinner> Martial Law? Who would enforce it?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Im not sure they would have a choice
<RainbowAsh> LordCelestia, you forget that in many revolutions in the past, part of the army joined the revolutionary cause
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The US army might easy turn against us, especially under orders.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Lest they drop out and fight for us
<String_Shredder> Kandarihu: season's over
<AdamThePony> aren't we supposed to be watching Monty Python
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh, looks like you beat me to that point
<AdamThePony> ?
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> AdamThePony: 1 hour.
<AdamThePony> oh yeah.
<Acleps> RankWinner: Actually it's proven that when someone with a high auctority tells someone to do something - even if it's wrong - they will likely do it.
<AdamThePony> Shit
<JESmith71> I think it's pretty obivous there isn't it Kanadrihu
<pony_300> this sounds like the idea for a game plot; just revamp PIPA and SOPA into more mutual and emotional ideas
<Obsidian> still have 55 mis
<Cookie-Cutter> Yeah! I think we are suppose to me
<Cookie-Cutter> (*be
<GameTaco> So are you going to continue streaming Aquabats, or is it right that it was only shown today due to the hopes of catching the Brony Shoutout?
<Pinkies4thWall> Martial Law= Homefront War
<GameTaco> Just so I know if I should sleep in or not. ^_^;
<yifle1> i miss megaupload
<GarrettBrony> so do i
<Litwick> Everyone! Message the Army and stuff and tell them of the dark side of America!
<MadSurge> '74, '75 :)
<cachi01> yifle1: megaupload........... ;_;
<RainbowAsh> Am I the only one that would like to see more Dan Vs. on here?
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: the military is sworn to uphold the constitution. To refuse an order that violates the constitutional rights of the people is part of the army's duty.
<yifle1> :(
<pony_1169> no new episode?
<RankWinner> Acleps: Not if it's totally wrong. There is a degree of propaganda/barin-washing going on in the army, as there should be, but not nearly enough to convince soldiers to shoot their neighbours.
<pony_300> season 2 finished
<GarrettBrony> 76
<CCCP> im feeling awfluy sad today
<Dken2021> pony_1169 nope, but there's movies and pony episodes later
<pony_3604> :P
<MadSurge> RainbowAsh: No, I was positively impressed
<Wrek|Observing> 05back
<yifle1> it was there i go most of my things from
<GarrettBrony> 76
<Kandarihu> RankWinner: you like the brainwashing?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RainbowAsh: I can try and get Season 2 eps.
<pony_1169> damn...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01front
<Pinkies4thWall> Morals=/=orders
<RainbowAsh> Nittany_Discord, that would be totally awesome. ^^
<Dken2021> side-to-side
<Pinkies4thWall> *morals~orders
<Kandarihu> Morals > Orders
<RankWinner> I say 'brainwashing'... I just mean propaganda disguised as other things, such as "Wear makeup! It's good! You'll only be beautifull with makeup!"
<Pinkies4thWall> Kandarihu: not necessarily
<GameTaco> Yes, I'll only be beautiful with makeup...
<SpringWonder> *sigh* Why does there have to be so much intolerance in our world :'(
<Dken2021> have you seen me without makeup?
<GilDash> Ohh, can I get some makeup?!
<RankWinner> Reminded me of that ice cream part of... er... Invader Zim(?)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Psychological studies have shown that people will obey orders more easily than you think even if they aren't "moral."
<Kandarihu> So if the government ordered you to do something that you knew in your heart was the wrong thing to do, you'd do it?
<yifle1> we can´t do anything about it
<stoutblade> that is i big thing there are alot of people who are wondering if the militay will follow obama if he where to go bad
<SpringWonder> Deae Lunae, right?
<Litwick> America=A shitty country. If only my relatives didn;t live there.
<Acleps> RankWinner: There was a psychological test, where people were told to give eachother electical shocks (not real) if the other one answers a question wrong. After a while the person recieving shocks pretended to die. Most of the people tested kept on giving shocks even though they knew that the shocks were lethal.
<Wrek|Observing> 05so... what to do next...
<FlareChaser> ....Draw you! :D
<GilDash> @Kandarihu: Remember, there's the punishment for refusal...
<AdamThePony> is that Pandora, he's using?
<pony_3604> the wings?
<FlareChaser> wings
<drf|away_SchoolPC> 02*WB03(Rukario03)02WB* - <Umbreon> there really isn't anything hard about DOS <Umbreon> except making it do something useful
<Pinkies4thWall> not me, but there are people who will follow orders with little or no question, Kandarihu
<Obsidian> The Mane?
<AdamThePony> Wrek, are you using pandora?

<Acleps> GilDash: Finally I see someone again, usually I only talk to certain people once here :S
<SpringWonder> This song sounds like a remix of Deae Lunae.
<Furry21> Hello!
<Acleps> GilDash: The first movie is awesome ! :)
<FlareChaser> HandCock: No.
<RainbowAsh> Luna deos <3
<RankWinner> Either way, what was I saying. Er... ah yes, those experiments were confined. Once people see other people being killed and speak up it can jog you back into being semi-normal.
<Ninjazz> This song...
<GilDash> @Acleps: I just jump right in. Never know what you'll find. :)
<Pinkies4thWall> inb4 kick
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> HandCock: give Wrek more credit than that.
<GilDash> @Acleps: I know, right! Monty Python FTW!
<Ninjazz> Dear Luna?
<Dken2021> allo Furry21!!
<Ninjazz> Furry21, welcome.
<RankWinner> Killing a person because you were told to and having nobody tell you it's wrong is one thing, killing somebody and having a whole country condemn you for it is another.
<Acleps> GilDash: The second movie is not that great tho...
<Obsidian> Hello Furry21

<MahBoi777> whoa O_O that looks awesome
<RainbowAsh> Pinkies4thWall, yesterday

<GilDash> @Acleps: That's what happens *every* time I'm on here. I only ever manage to focus on the new pony eps, and that's about it. :D
<Kandarihu> GilDash: what kind of people? Who would approve of destroying that which makes life good just in order to live a little longer.

<GarrettBrony> MahBoi777 by best robot rock you mean Tom Servo Right?
<GameTaco> Why not? I wanna see adorkable Twilight attempt to hold a relationship while freaking out about it. >_>
<Chimera> hi]
<Dances_With_Discord> The way that she was defeated I thought was a bit cliche but never the less she is de best villian right next to discord :D
<Acleps> RainbowAsh: :D
<cachi01> GameTaco: no just no..........
<Dken2021> Pale_Horse wat, is that like some sequel to 2012?
<cachi01> GameTaco: g4 would turn int g3
<GameTaco> Which will collapse by the end of the episode/.
<cachi01> and we dont want that happen
<FlareChaser> prince-dari: I'm just gonna sit here, and watch you, till you talk.

<pony_3604> chrysalis is probably one of the coolest
<cachi01> xd joke
<Obsidian> Okay
<Acleps> I'm acually REALLY happy that FiM doesn't talk about love relationships often, because that's basically what all the children's shows do
<MadSurge> Equestria remix!
<Kandarihu> Self-respect can be corrupted into narccism and friendship can be corrupted into codependance. But love in it's true form cannot be corrupted. That's why love conquers all.
<ACS13123> equestria girls?
<ACS13123> fine then...
<Pinkies4thWall> Chrysalis is best villain art wise
<GarrettBrony> I have this on my Ipod
<GarrettBrony> along with the living tombstone
<ACS13123> Chrysalis is best Phony
<Pinkies4thWall> Discord is best troll villain
<MadSurge> Acleps: and that's why they eventually suck
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pinkies4thWall: Agreed.
<FlareChaser> http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/our-staff/ Learn about the mods!
<GilDash> @Acleps: Love is overrated. FFTW. (Friendship for the win!)
<RainbowAsh> Kandarihu, so, if love gets corrupted, it hadn't been true? That is somewhat idealistic
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: indeed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really love her design for the most part.
<cachi01> ACS13123: literally she is everypony

<Mario> One day in Equestria Appleass was killing Pinkie Pie but then

<GarrettBrony> da da da da
<SpringWonder> Looks like Chrysalis needs some love, she's gotten all skinny.
<Acleps> ACS13123: What's the next step after love?
<pyrocatboy> Flutterguy!?
<Pinkies4thWall> GameTaco: 5 million money
<RainbowAsh> ACS13123, that makes much sense in world. Only problem is that love is so overdone.
<Dken2021> GameTaco and then they made Chrysalis pink
<GameTaco> ALL my money.
<CrimsonPhoenix> GameTaco: I would buy it in a heartbeat
<ACS13123> after love...NO IDEA
*GarrettBrony glomps Chrysalis
<MahBoi777> cheese legs

<GilDash> @Acleps: Ahhhhhhrrrrrgghhhhh!
<Pinkies4thWall> Hornlock is best battle scene
<cachi01> O_O *facehoof*
<Mario> Elvis?
<Dken2021> pony_7740 there is no ep 27
<Kandarihu> Queen Chrysalis subsists on love but cannot reciprocate what she is given. That is why she is evil.
<Ninjazz> Its blues.
<MahBoi777> Elvis ftw
<GarrettBrony> wat is the link to this song
<Acleps> GilDash: It was a good movie. I liked how there were so many actors, and it took place in so many different locations.
<FlareChaser> Hey guys!

<Dken2021> wha?
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> FlareChaser: lied.
<GilDash> @Acleps: What I really liked was the continuity and the adherence to science.
<GameTaco> And when you press a button on her flank, she says, "I'm a queen. Are you a queen too? ...I didn't think so."
<Obsidian> ummm
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> lies^
<Pinkies4thWall> When is Monty Python starting?
<Kandarihu> But then again, she loves her Changling subjects. That's the only good side of her.
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Pinkies4thWall: 30 min.
<Sundaysmile> 30mins
<Pinkies4thWall> OSHIT
<GilDash> @Pinkies4thWall: Half an hour.
<Dken2021> FlareChaser if you are, then you would know my deepest darkest secrets then
<Pinkies4thWall> QUICK SHOWER TIME!
<GarrettBrony> @Wrek what is this song called?
<Acleps> GilDash: Yeah, the physics were thought of before they even started planning on making the movie.
<FlareChaser> Dken2021: You watch MLP FiM.
<cachi01> uhmmmmmmmm can we say that season 1 first 2 episodes were a movie then first 2 season 2 episodes were another movie and the finale was another moviee?????????????
<Pale_Horse> I personally still believe that Changelings are actually the descendants of Flutter Ponies.
<GilDash> @Acleps: I bet they've got tonnes of pages of paper with all the workings on.
*pyrocatboy is nom nomming on a pizza.
<MahBoi777> cachi01: ummmm maybe? lol
<Dken2021> FlareChaser . . . lucky guess
<Pinkies4th|freshenup> showertiem
<Kandarihu> cachi01: if they ran at least 90 minutes in total, then yes.
<Pale_Horse> I think if they ever got enough true love they would actually get their pretty looks and Butterfuly wings back.
<GarrettBrony> what is the name of this song
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> cachi01: you can say it, but it wouldnt be true.
<Litwick> Back with lunch :)
<Magic> wow my iternet is bein a bitch
<Shamroc> moo
<FlareChaser> GUYS! HOLY CRAP.
<Acleps> GilDash: They've got 300 GB of text files on their computers.
<Kandarihu> cachi01: I meant if EACH of them ran for 90 minutes in total, sorry
<Litwick> What is it Flare?
<Shamroc> ell everypony
<GameTaco> If they bring the changelings back, they totally need to explain away the copy-paste background ponies as changelings that had been planted all throughout Equestria from the very beginning. :P
<cachi01> lol
<FlareChaser> The CURE FOR CANCER HAS BEEN FOUND
<Magic> wow my iternet is bein a bitch

<FlareChaser> Obsidian: that wasnt ALL caps.
<GarrettBrony> what is this song
<GameTaco> "...Hey, this pony looks like me." "No I don't." "...No. You don't."
<Mario> One day in equestria applejack was kicking fluttershy but the batman came in and exploded, Celestia married winona and had to puppies named snooser and dumbass, then sonic 65e8e56
<Obsidian> The previous one was
<cachi01> MahBoi777: thos do not exist
<Kandarihu> FlareChaser: are you joking or do you know what I know?
<FlareChaser> Shall I make the evidence?
<GarrettBrony> Obsisdian what was the last song called
<FlareChaser> I cant post youtube links...but I can...
<Pale_Horse> if you would.
<Acleps> GilDash: That's why the movie should be used to teach physics.
<FlareChaser> memebase.com
<MahBoi777> cachi01: your right, how silly:P
<FlareChaser> goo
<Litwick> Yeah right, AMERICA finding the cure for cancer before CANADA. Pffffttt
<Obsidian> How would i know?
<GarrettBrony> I dk
<FlareChaser> Canada found it.
<GarrettBrony> @Wrek wat was the last song called
<GameTaco> ...She actually looks kinda sexy with only half her hair. The Pinkamena effect.
<Litwick> OH SHIT CANADA THIS IS WHY I LOVE YA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01America will find the cure for cancer if it's profitable.
<Pale_Horse> looks a little too "punk" too me
<GilDash> @Acleps: No, that movie should just replace all lessons taught anywhere. Using only that movie would teach you to survive anything. Even the cold confines of space.
<cachi01> canada already found it
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> they wont cure it. more money in treating it.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: profit has nothing to do with it.
<GameTaco> Maybe add a tattoo.
<MahBoi777> Litwick: we're too busy making iphones smaller to work on medicine, lol
<Dken2021> cure for cancer, only $9999.99
<cachi01> WOW R34 PIC????
<Ninjazz> What the...
<Obsidian> what?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If we cure cancer, drug companies that make chemo drugs will lose a lot of money.
<GilDash> @Kandarihu: If they think they can get more money out of treatment over cure, they'll probably go with treatment...
<GameTaco> Fluttershy: Known cure for cancer, side effects include heart attacks.
<GameTaco> And of course, blood sugar elevation.
<GilDash> @GameTaco: And death?
<RAWRity> oh hey, Saturn's convention is up on EQD!
<GameTaco> Don't worry, I have the pills that cure the death.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And those drug companies are either going to lobby or use patents to stop the cure.
<GilDash> @GameTaco: Oh, that's okay then.
<Acleps> GilDash: It should be the movie we send to travel through space, so that creatures less intelligent than us can survive in coffins
<Magic> lm gonna leave damn internet is bein a bitch
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's hyperbolic, but possible.
<MahBoi777> bye Magic
<Kipkat07_Mare> Nittany_Discord: The horrible truth
<cachi01> I SWEAR I SAW A PC OF SHE HAVING A DICK INFRONT OF HER O_o
<Magic> bye all

<Ryanier128> hello LunaTheBeloved
<PrincessDismo> ... So what if they loose money, Would a cure not be worth it? Surely you think A cure would be worth it,
<GarrettBrony> @Wrek|Observing what was the last song called?
<MI9000> hello
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Do you have stocks or money to buy politicians?
<SpringWonder> Fluttershy is the cure for cancer but you're likely to get something else in return...
<That_British_Guy> My Little Pony's been butch﻿ since Friendship is Magic. :P
<GilDash> @Kandarihu: They also have money. And probably connections.
<MahBoi777> darn politics
<Kandarihu> Money isn't friggin' everything guys.

<GameTaco> I really like her mane.
<PrincessDismo> TheRainbowDash: ............. >;l -Growl-
<Obsidian> I really like her mane!
<RainbowAsh> The problem with votes is that in most countries only two parties can be expected to be in power at any given point. If you are in one of those, you don't worry about losing an election, because you can be quite sure you will regain power in some years
<Wrek|Observing> 05ive been searchign for the truth

<String_Shredder> very
<RainbowAsh> pony_4588, do you know any countries where there are more than two major parties?

*pyrocatboy airguitars.
<HowToFryChicken> wat are we watching for Euronight?
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Yeah, I can see it in PrincessDismo's eyes.;)
<pony_4588> not major, but more than one party is of importance in many copuntries
<MahBoi777> lol Lyra
<PrincessDismo> GilDash: TheRainbowDash Yes, Extremely...... I'm trying not to start a fight in chat tbh
<Marx> A pizza muffin... I just might wanna try one of those.
*LunaTheBeloved pokes everypony
<GilDash> @TheRainbowDash: But you gotta share, you gotta care. :D
<pony_4588> germanys gouvernment = 3 parties AT THE MOMENT
<GarrettBrony> I bet G5 will focus on Derpy, Octavia, Vinyl Scratch, Lyra, Carrot top, and BON Bon
<MahBoi777> pizza muffin? that sounds delicious
<TheRainbowDash> PrincessDismo: Naw, it's all for laughs and sillies!
<GameTaco> It's too bad we can't get by without any political parties. Alas, we are a people of classifications and categorizations. And maybe just a few absolutes.
<Shamroc> oh hey LunaTheBeloved...mind not doing that again
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Better than our two-party system.
<robotdragon7> EY everypony..just got skyrim and played it.
<GilDash> @PrincessDismo: Hey, there's enough Dash to go around. :)
<Kandarihu> Look. The cure for cancer is antibodies taking little gold particles to every single cancerous cell in the body, and using radiation to superheat the gold particle, killing the cancer cells and leaving the normal cells alone. No side-effects, and it works on all types of cancer.
<GameTaco> Registered Intependent and proud of it.
<LunaTheBeloved> Sorry...
<Vinyl> GarrettBrony i wouldnt put money on it
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I share....some of the time.:D
<pony_4588> smaller parties are important here

<robotdragon7> yeah i also got the REALLY thick game guide
<Kipkat07_Mare> hi
<pyrocatboy> Kandarihu: Sounds kinda painful.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We have other parties, but they don't hold major political seats.
<GarrettBrony> GilDash HIV is Also a RetroVirus
<RainbowAsh> pony_4588, I know, in many countries you get coalitions between parties, but even there, you got two big parties and several smaller ones, that have no chance to claim positions like president or chancellor
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Kipkat07_Mare! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
<GameTaco> Inb4 Earth is Korriban
<LunaTheBeloved> brbr
<robotdragon7> lol i had a beer glass for a while cachi01
<pyrocatboy> SpringWonder: So politicians are Sith?
<MahBoi777> hey Kipkat07_Mare!
<GilDash> @GarrettBrony: I don't see what your point is...
<LunaTheBeloved> *brb
<Kipkat07_Mare> TheRainbowDash: Good and you? (hugs and waves)
<cachi01> lol
<Kandarihu> It's already been tested in animals, and it's been PHENOMONALLY successful.
*Shibakuzou_WallDives sighs
<Kipkat07_Mare> herro MahBoi777
<GarrettBrony> You know who was also Chancellor? HItler
<pony_2507> Euro Movie Night waht movis ?
<Bronysith> pyrocatboy im a sith and i hate politics
<TheRainbowDash> Kipkat07_Mare: I'm doing well too.
<GameTaco> Chancellor Puddinghead.
<RainbowAsh> GarrettBrony, I thought he was fuhrer?
<Ninjazz> You're sick, Dashie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate politics, but politics won't leave me alone.
<GameTaco> The only one that can think *inside* the chimney.
<GilDash> @GameTaco: Best Chancellor ever.
<robotdragon7> no i hope shes healthy
<pyrocatboy> Bronysith: Thats because your a brony as well.
<RainbowAsh> GilDash, most competent I have ever seen
<Kipkat07_Mare> Who watches the Colbert Report besides me?
<robotdragon7> is wrek streaming
<GarrettBrony> He was the Chancellor of Germany before he became the Furhur Rainbowash. ps Glomp Fight
<GilDash> @RainbowAsh: Without a shadow of a doubt.
<TheRainbowDash> Nittany_Discord: It is one of those thinhgs that you want to go away, but it never will.
<Ninjazz> Kipkat07_Mare: From time to time.
<pyrocatboy> Kipkat07_Mare: Occasionally
<MahBoi777> robotdragon7: yes
<robotdragon7> oh cause hes a good artist
<GameTaco> I just realized, it's pretty dark out. So cloudy~
<Kipkat07_Mare> Ninjazz: I watched it when I found out he was a brony
<Kandarihu> The thing is, you think the Pharmacutical companies will be lobbying to get this technique banned. It makes more sense if they jump on this as a bandwagon and start PRODUCING this cure themselves. THAT is what capitalism is about, not greed.
<RainbowAsh> GarrettBrony, oh yes, I think I heard about it. Hitler gained power when Germany was a democracy and then made laws that turned it into a dictatorship, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, hopefully the political winds blowing against me will change.
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> I hate hosptials.

<cachi01> SpringWonder: lol
<Kipkat07_Mare> TheRainbowDash: That brought me to the show and then I got into the jokes
<TheRainbowDash> I wub SuperBrony64.:)
<Kipkat07_Mare> Nittany_Discord: OMG ME TOOOOO
<GilDash> @Kandarihu: Why? Why not produce patents, declare it a breach of said patents and then continue milking money by sub-standard treatment?
<GarrettBrony> yes RainbowAsh. Kudos for your knowledge on German Political History, For that you will recieve 1 free Intertube
<Obsidian> Why so much hate? We need to love and tolerate.
*Kipkat07_Mare loves SuperBrony64
<pyrocatboy> MahBoi777: I really hate that vest.
<MahBoi777> I hate helicopters
<TheRainbowDash> (wubs Kipkat07_Mare even more)
<RainbowAsh> GarrettBrony, yay
<Ryanier128> well, I'm back with WARM Coca-Cola and a COLD Pizza Muffin
<robotdragon7> l4d joke obsidian

<MahBoi777> pyrocatboy: I'm gonna hate that shoe over there
<cachi01> I LIKE TRAINS WOOOOHOHOHOHO
*GarrettBrony cleans his dishes WITH WUBS
<GameTaco> Unless feeding off the love *results in* the hate.

<RainbowAsh> Oh hai SuperBrony64
<cachi01> he is really pretty cool but i think there's something wrong with him
<Kipkat07_Mare> SuperBrony64: ohaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
<Ryanier128> thanks GilDash, that's happened to me before
<TheRainbowDash> (I will never leave you. Kipkat07_Mare. - Rainbow Dash of Loytalty)...never...

<cachi01> I LIKE TRAINSHey! Have you heard of the I Like Trains kid?He's pretty cool, but I think there's something wrong with himI don't know if he's cursed, or if it's something with his brainBut the only thing he ever says is:I LIKE TRAINS

<Cypresswolf> but...cheese isnt a vegetable O_o
<GilDash> @Ryanier128: Hooray for my laziness and less lazy people on this chatroom!
<SpringWonder> Cheese... do you mean vegan-friendly?
<Kandarihu> The thing is, if it weren't for someone without any connections taking a stab at this, this cure would've never happened. Governments are dumping loads of money into trying to cure cancer and got nothing for their expenditure.
<Ninjazz> Toss me one over here, That_British_Guy.
<MahBoi777> cheese is best vegetable
<Barbetos> I think it is time to save your progress. that program looks ready to crash
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> nvm.
