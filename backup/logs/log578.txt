<GarrettBrony> Arcshod the only other person I would argue was the best joker is Keath Ledger
<JackofApples> Wait...best charge scene...best charge...BESSSSSTTTT CHAAARRRGGGEEE!
<hen3ry> Leeeeeeeeeroy...
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
<Vordox> wtf...?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Vordox> XD
<Ponies47> SuperSanjitenks1989: I hate Regular Show -_-

<Kandarihu> Hey, Han Shot First... again
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> :D
<Vordox> LAWL WTF WAS THAT?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> And then more
<Eulshy> that knockback
<XylemTube> why did they run away?
<SuperSanjitenks1989> FUCK YOU
<Arcshod> I'll wait til it's on video. Until a few seconds ago I thought I was the only person who didn't care for the Dark Knight.
<hen3ry> shit they just remembered they outnumber me
<Pudge> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<CriticKitten> Don't get me wrong, I love the Ledger Joker, but Hamill's Joker voice is CLASSIC. And it really makes the Arkham Asylum/City games even better having his crazy voice behind it.
<GarrettBrony> look Luke is Skipping like an ape
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AARRRRGGGGGAAAAAHHH!!! :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> CriticKitten: its sad that Hamill isnt doing more joker work
<Meanwhile> Seriously how did they not hit him?
<JackofApples> What kind of stupid hallway is that? I thought he came out to a hangar?! :{
<Squallken> EPIC MOMENT COMING :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD

*Nittany_Discord 11,01pew
<Pudge> what is this wilhelm scream?
<Calcos323> SuperSanjitenks1989: It's Wlhelm, not Walter
<Reactor> XylemTube: That made me laugh pretty hard. Thanks for that.
<Vordox> EW
<Ingwaz> take blaster, put it under door, FIRE AWAY
<Ingwaz> easy kills
<Vordox> Ewwww Eww ewwww
<CriticKitten> Darkts3: Can't blame him for saying "that's enough". But I'll always remember his Joker voice as my favorite.
<otakon> brb need a drink
<Eulshy> Now kiss
<Bronysith> 2nd best LIGHTSABER BATTLE
<Lil_B> that scene needed the Iniana Jones-Jingle
<SuperSanjitenks1989> I have no idea why I said waler
<CriticKitten> It's just the most spot on.
<SuperSanjitenks1989> *walter
<Kandarihu> It's a scream that kind of goes aaaaAAAA
<hen3ry> keep that luck within the family
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> Pudge: Biggest running joke in cinematography
<otakon> Kandarihu: the Wilheim scream
<Eulshy> C3PO was looking at them ponies
<otakon> it's famous
<sagas> I do hope w're gonna watch the prequals afterwards, RIGHT?
<Bronysith> Luke vs vader and then Obi Wan vs vader in a new hope are the best lightsaber duels!
<otakon> sagas: NO
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Fail
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> sagas: oh god no
<Ingwaz> hen3ry: just like the apple family
<Bronysith> BEST LIGHTSABER DUEL

<Arcshod> EWWW, is that the special edition?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Swartz
<Ingwaz> otakon: awwww
<Vordox> I HAVE THE HIGH...no...wait I don't...Feck
<Pudge> oh shit
<Pudge> BEST SCENE VER
<CriticKitten> Eh, I dunno, I like the passion in the Luke vs Vader fight in Return of the Jedi.
<otakon> Arcshod: enope
*Bronysith slaps Vordox
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Time for old people to swing sticks around.
<Pudge> EVER*
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Round 2. FIGHT.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: oh god
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Darth
<Sumica> 00,10we meet again for the first time for the last time
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: it is an epic fight man
<CriticKitten> But this one is definitely a classic.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: yeah the only thing that the prequels did right were the lightsaber duels
<Arcshod> It's got the remastered saber effects.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Think of Wonder Woman... think of Wonder Woman....
<XylemTube> the dumbass that got knocked into the lava. Some master.....
<Bronysith> otakon: right? those battles were terrible
<CriticKitten> otakon: Eh. Yes and no.
<Kandarihu> Kids like lasers. Kids like swordfighting. You know what would be awesome, laser swordfights
<Sumica> 00,10it's a wub battle
<GarrettBrony> Arcshod what if the next time they rerelease Star Wars they digitally Insert Ponies
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> "I See Your Schwartz Is as Big as Mine"
<Eulshy> If you strike me down I shall become more powerfull than you can imagine
<Ingwaz> oh... found out my supervisor at work is a bit of a derp. she thought it was lightsaver, not saber
<sagas> No, you'll just be dead
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> DAT QUOTE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did you hear David Prouse do these lines?
<otakon> Bronysith: huh? how were the lightsaber battles horrible in Episode 1?
<Bronysith> otakon: the battles in the prequels were horrible. just over choreographed bullshit
<Bronysith> otakon: thiose werent duels. THEY WERE DANCING
<Kandarihu> Obi Wan is second best martyr.
<Ponies47> brb
<otakon> Bronysith: it was still more interesting than this
<Vordox> Didn't Obi wan actually win this fight?
<red_ony> the prequel's light saber fight slacked any emotional impact..
<Bronysith> otakon: NOPE it is just dancing
<Eulshy> Bronysith, really no one cares
<otakon> Goddamn it's like watching Rockem Sockem robots
<Ingwaz> Bronysith: these are horribly coreographed duels. its two sides of the coin
<Bronysith> otakon: that isnot how a duel would happen in real life
<Lil_B> Vordox yes... when you call that winning
<Barbetos> I love the fact that THIS fight is way more intense than the one by the same characters in episode 3.
<CriticKitten> otakon: The old fights weren't as well choreographed but usually had some good emotion behind it. The prequel battles are choreographed to DEATH. They're flashy but there's no emotion, it's just Hollywood flair.
<Arcshod> GarrettBrony Ponies could not redeem Lucas' revisions.
<hen3ry> and hope they didn't disable the engines, the weapons, the navigation, the life support, etc etc etc
<XylemTube> But the choreography is what made Darth maul Awesome. And darthmaul was the best part of Episode one Bronysith
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Ben...? :O :O
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> and suddenly a theater for the troopers
<ponibas> portal cubes!
<Bronysith> XylemTube: are you kidding me? he was entirely pointless
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah but that is what I'm saying they are more impressive looking even if they aren't as "deep"
<JackofApples> I prefered the superimposed hundreds of Stoms at the chase scene.
<SuperSanjitenks1989> SLICE
<PinkiePieYoshi64> NOOOOOO!!!! :'(
<Fisheh_Fish> NOOOO OBI WAN! :'(
<Calcos323> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<GarrettBrony> Kandarihu the best martyr is torgo
<Meanwhile> And yet again somehow, they don't hit him.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> :'(
<Sumica> 00,10you forgot the couch
<red_ony> *cue sad music*
<XylemTube> Poor eels :'(
<SuperSanjitenks1989> HHH-AA!
<Vordox> Suddenly music and weird wtfness when he just turns into Midichlorians
<Eulshy> Now Luke has a reason
<Thrackerzod> Except he wasnt killed :P
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Run, Luke, Run!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm somehow they turned the couch Invisible
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Run Luke run!
<Arcshod> RUN, LUKE. RUN!
<Bronysith> AVENGE ME LUKE FACE VADER NOW!!!
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> Actually I think that sword fight with Darth Maul was the best if not the only really good scene in ep1.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> INBOUND BEST SCENE OF THE MOVIE!!!!
<hen3ry> Vordox: You mean when he becomes one with the force. Midichlorians do not exist.
<Lunchbox> Run, Forrest, Run! Wait, wrong movie...
<CriticKitten> otakon: I agree, they LOOK better. But I don't like them as much because they just don't have the same feeling to them. It feels like you're watching a staged match, it doesn't feel as alive.
<OtakuTom> See Luke. See Luke Run. Run, Luke, run!
<Bronysith> SirGanjalf|SetToStun: the battle is just dancing, no real emotional conflict
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> Shame he died:|
<Vordox> hen3ry: no they exist.
<JackofApples> And I prefer the faster duels, honestly. It's better for music videos, and it made me love Star Wars more.
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah I can see that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Run, For... dammit Lunchbox!
<sagas> Not one of them could hit him from 50ft away with rifles. Damn the future can suck
<hen3ry> Vordox: No, see, you've bought into the rumor that there were "prequels"
<Calcos323> CriticKitten: I feel ya. The battle here isn't too good, but the battle between Luke and Vader is one of the best sword fights ever.
<Bronysith> otakon: ill just get mass effect 3 next month
<otakon> CriticKitten: still like Yoda's fight though.
<Ponies47> back :P
<otakon> Bronysith: sounds good
<red_ony> SirGanjalf|SetToStun: Oh come on..Wshat about those awesome podraces? :O (jk)
<otakon> I don't know why he's so upset
<ponibas> Why do they call them TIE Fighters?
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Lightsabers should be made of Nokia 3310's.
<JackofApples> As a kid, I loved the space battles and the saber duels. That hasn't stopped. XD
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Mares and GentleStallions: John Williams at his best!
<otakon> He knew Obi Wan for like 4 hours
<hen3ry> ponibas: Twin Ion Engine
<Bronysith> otakon: cause then it isnot MY money that is supporting EA, nyuck nyuck nyuck
<Lil_B> SuperSanjitenks1989 and Nintendium
<ponibas> >.<
<Sumica> 00,10it's ok luke, the prequal trilogy would have killed him any ways
<GarrettBrony> the best peice of music right here
<CriticKitten> These ones aren't as flashy, but there's LIFE to them. It's like watching an actual sword fight. Too much concern for looking pretty in most of the prequel duels.
<JESmith71> Well even though we won't look at the prequels can we look at Star Tours after the movies are over?
<otakon> Sumica: lol
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> red_ony: meh, there were ok when i was a kid
<Vordox> hen3ry: You sure? It's not cause it looks like a Tie?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> DUN! Dun, Dun, Dunna!
<Pudge> Stop hatin on the prequels they arent as bad as people say
<Bronysith> i fucking loves this scene
<hen3ry> Vordox: a bit of that too.
<GarrettBrony> Thai Fighters
<Bronysith> THE MUSIC IS EPIC
<ponibas> Thai fighters :p
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Best Music ever!
<Agrold> love this music
<otakon> GODDAMMIT MIPS WORK RIGHT YOU INGLORIOUS BASTARD!
<XylemTube> Dem vector Graphics
<CriticKitten> Calcos: Inorite? Return of the Jedi's fight sequence is one of the most memorable bits of the series.
<red_ony> SirGanjalf|SetToStun: Well I was just kidding after all...
<Calcos323> Why is the audio so tinny?
<Bronysith> Sumica: adrenaline is pumping for me right now
<GarrettBrony> Needles!
<magmablock> This Episode IV?
*Bronysith pours adrenaline on Sumica
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My drink's cold!

<Vordox> IN SPACE
<ponibas> unspoiled Episode IV

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I killed someone!
<SlurryMoon> 3Thai tie tying TI fighters
<Reactor> Why do laser cannons have recoil?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Bronysith: he's mine bitch!
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Don't get penisy.
<Pudge> Calcos323: this movie isnt exactly new you know
<red_ony> guess those laggs mean I can go get a drink now
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: ...What
*Ponies47 Ties otakon to a chair "Hush you. Now I'm gonna leave you tied to this chair until you calm down"
*Bronysith fangirl slaps PaladinDrakkenwolf
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Because Star Wars is well known for its realism. :P
<PinkiePieYoshi64> BOOM!
<JackofApples> Star Tours, yesss...ah likes that. Also, why so few fighters? I remember more...and yes, the ROTJ fight is one of the best. Then Palpitine had to be a Marty Stu. :D
<GarrettBrony> Reactor cause the energy discharge
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Clearly!
<Calcos323> Pudge: It doesn't sound like that when I watch it on my VHS, though
<XylemTube> Reactor, maybe it's a pulse lazer?
<Eulshy> Meow
<Fou_Lou> Reactor: because that are most probably actually blasters
*PaladinDrakkenwolf starts a slap fight with Bronysith
<Lil_B> Reactor ikr ... Light has no Mass , and recoil only happens when mass gets accelerated
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> In space everybody can hear you Howie scream
*Eulshy Pokes messanger below me

<ponibas> "Thats how we do it in my neighborhood!"

*Ponies47 Tackles PaladinDrakkenwolf and Bronysith down to the floor
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> "I am melting!"
*Bronysith gives Sumica a mark hamil
<magmablock> Hard to believe this movie was made in '77. Feels like it was made in the mid 80s
<CriticKitten> So let's review: to recapture a priority Rebellion prisoner, you send exactly three TIE fighters after them.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01plays in the Reactor and gets radiated
<Calcos323> Pudge: Must be a problem on my end, then
<Reactor> If they were PLASMA cannons, recoil would make sense.
*Bronysith gives Nittany_Discord a rainbow dash
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thank Bronysith.
<red_ony> magmablock: Go watch a space odeysee
*Reactor is played in by Nittany_Discord
<PinkiePieYoshi64> In Star Wars, the woman is alright useful!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> *always
<Randomnerd> Ohohoho... I've picked a bad movie this week!
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: not to mention the weaponry of the space station
*Vordox closes the reactor down. and remembers Nittany_Discord's part cat... So he's Schroedinger's Nitts's cat.
<Bronysith> psssst Nittany_Discord there are coordinates and a detonation to EA headquarters int the rainbow dash...
<Sumica> 00,10he's in it for the crackerbarrle cheese
<SuperSanjitenks1989> DALLAS
<IshBestPony> hai everypony

<JackofApples> ...
<Lil_B> this movie has about 20min left
<hen3ry> We're tracking them. We'll just make sure to follow far enough behind that we're sure to give them time to plan an attack on us.
*Randomnerd makes a trollface

<SuperSanjitenks1989> Who shot JR?

<JackofApples> Randomnerd: You shall...be poked by Gummy for that! :[
<XylemTube> luke be jealous
<Randomnerd> The horror! The horror!
<Bronysith> otakon: ddo you have mass effect 3 for pc? if so i would love to play multiplayer
<Pudge> Han Solo is the biggest pimp
<red_ony> Randomnerd: Why ? This movie was just too bad? :(
<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: I'm amazed that it ONLY occurs to the princess that this thing is being tracked, given that they were MAJOR targets. No way you send not even a full squadron of fighters after them.
<GarrettBrony> Bronysith do I taste like raisans?
<IshBestPony> I noticed something odd in the newsletter. It says you'll be streaming the star wars prequels, but thats impossible considering no such prequels exist
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> speeding they be
<ponibas> pew pew .. gotcha
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tides must be horrible on that moon.
<red_ony> pewepew
<otakon> Bronysith: enope, PC can't run it plus started my journey on the 360 WHERE IT FIRST BEGAN.
<Randomnerd> red_ony: because I'm EVIL.
<Bronysith> otakon: yea i did play mass effect 1 and 2 on 360
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: yep
<PinkiePieYoshi64> How did they hear about Alderaan?
<CriticKitten> >galaxy-wide Rebellion
<Bronysith> otakon: everyone remembers there mass effect journies
<Reactor> Those graphics
<hen3ry> PinkiePieYoshi64: GNN.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> xD
<XylemTube> Blow up death star... DONT WORRY WELL JUST BULD ANOTHER 1
<JESmith71> IshBestPony we're showing originals only
<CriticKitten> >their fleet contains roughly 20 single-pilot fighters

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh look, it's right there!
<Lil_B> C64*
<Calcos323> nub nub
<Meanwhile> It occured to me that this film has silly scene transitions.
<JackofApples> Because R2 is their only hope! Akso, the Death Star has...2 other versions? One official, one EU?
<Bronysith> otakon: mass effect 1 was hilariously buggy on pc
<SuperSanjitenks1989> fucking LAG
<Bronysith> otakon: like when i got on that snow planet with the rachnis everyone turned to black blobs for a while
<hen3ry> Death Star gives them time... to plan an attack, launch an attack, and still have the Death Star just out of range of its target.
<spitfirecolt> hay guys
<GarrettBrony> hey Bronysith http://www.geeksofdoom.com/GoD/img/2011/05/2011-05-31-who_droids-533x503.jpg
<otakon> Bronysith: yh but they did improve the inventory and control scheme
<red_ony> Meanwhile: Actually Lucas stole those swipes from certain japanese movies as well afaik
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Excuse me? Pricess Leea?

<Bronysith> otakon: do they have health packs in me3? i dont like the regenerating health
<Eulshy> the shaft
<CriticKitten> Uh, why do you have to go down the trench? Can't you just dive towards the hole and drop it down the hole?
<XylemTube> thats a really bad weakness. somebody need to fire the morons who designed the deathstar.
<Sumica> 00,10TOLD
<GarrettBrony> zomg sagas it is a pong graphics
<sagas> rats bigger than 2 meters
<red_ony> That is a pretty big weakoness
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> may the force be with you
<ponibas> CriticKitten, details
<Eulshy> He keeps saying shaft
<Calcos323> And also with you
<Meanwhile> Tbh if you can't hit a target that's two metres across you shouldn't be holding a gun.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> May the Dash be with you... :D
<Lil_B> sagas kinda like vectrex

<Obsidian> *We
<magmablock> Commander's just like, "Yeah, whatever, weirdo."

<Obsidian> red_ony: HISHE

<Ryunosuke> not sure if trolling
<Arcshod> Eulshy: Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
<Arcshod> SHAFT
<GabeMoist> Use mirrors to deflect the death star beam
<Reactor> red_ony: I think there's a cooldown on the laser
<GabeMoist> problem solved
<Meanwhile> And then he got out of there to go buy a high-end apartment.
<sagas> I enjoyed the prequals, YEAH, FUCK ME RIGHT?
<CriticKitten> The HISHE is funny, though nonsensical. Yavin is a gas planet. There's really no reason they shouldn't try to fire the laser THROUGH Yavin at the moon.
<XylemTube> I <3 appartments
<Kandarihu> hen3ry, but can the Death Star's planet buster fire twice in quick succession?
<GarrettBrony> Arcshod He one Bad Mother Fu.....
<hen3ry> Kandarihu: Let's Find Out!
<spitfirecolt> they need rainbow dash she is good with the force\
<Arcshod> Shut yo mouth!

<red_ony> .
<Ryunosuke> wait
<GarrettBrony> Arcshod MAN i was only talking about Shaft
<red_ony> and my chat derped ...again,...:/(
<Ryunosuke> when did he suddenly start speaking droid
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: The one in Return of the Jedi can, by reducing the power of its shots to nail star cruisers instead. :p
<Arcshod> GarrettBrony We can dig it!
<hen3ry> Laser + mirror, if sufficiently powerful, equals melted glass and melted sheet of reflective metal.
<GarrettBrony> Arcshod I can dig it
<Pudge> i'm back with snacks
<Sumica> 00,10why do they have turbines?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Where's Fox?
<CriticKitten> Because star fighters
<Bronysith> Sumica: cause you clop at night

<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, I see. But then again, it can't destroy planets like that.
<GarrettBrony> Pudge did you bring me anything
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Sumica: Good question, there's no air in space...
<Sumica> 00,10I do not, I clop in the morning

<Pudge> Hey it's the space Red Tails
<Eulshy> why don't those x wings fire at the guns?
<Kandarihu> I just thought of something. Yavin is a gas giant. If the Death Star were to fire at it, the beam might not have anything solid to hit.

<CriticKitten> JackofApples: I played 'em in the original Rogue Squadron game on the N64, they're SOOOOO bad.
<red_ony> vrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeee

<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> rip

<Lil_B> CriticKitten and to think that they were maid by Factor 5 :(

<ponibas> i'll save you Biggs!
<Bronysith> DO A BARREL ROLL
<Bronysith> just had to do that
<otakon> Bronysith: oh hell no not a chance
<Kandarihu> magmablock, true. But where the Death Star is, at the time of before the rebels started trenchrunning, they could fire and only graze the outer reaches of the planet.
<XylemTube> why dont these fighters have missles?
<Lunchbox> Ah! I'm hit!
<SuperSanjitenks1989> okay... bye
<PinkiePieYoshi64> CriticKitten: Y-Wings were bad*** on Rogue: Squadron, they especially hleped a lot on Assult on Kyle II
<SirGanjalf|SetToStun> Can't let you do that Red Fox.
<Bronysith> otakon: okay good.... *puts away lightsaber*
<JackofApples> CriticKitten: I've played 'em in all the games, and I don't fly directly into fights...I do the bombing run, and pull out. :3
<otakon> Bronysith: the lightsaber duels were more fun is all I was saying.
<CriticKitten> Everyone should have used Naboo starfighters instead.
<JESmith71> Bronysith does it bug you that in the original Rouge Squadron game the Naboo Fighter was better than the X-Wing?
<hen3ry> They needed cheap disposable fighters for cheap, disposable pilots.
<CriticKitten> They were way better.
*Bronysith sticks CriticKitten s head on a stake
<JackofApples> Or better, Jedi Starfighters! Seismic Charges FTW!
<Calcos323> Holy God, I forgot how epic this is

<CriticKitten> Jedi Starfighters ARE sweet.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Nopony mess with the ARC-170s and Sentinal-Class shuttles, they're MINE!!!! :O
<Kandarihu> That Naboo Starfighter. It was crazy how they tried to keep that thing a secret until Episode 1 came out, but someone found it early anyway.
<Sumica> 00,10why is he talking like shatner?
<Pudge> oh look an atari game
<hen3ry> GarrettBrony: And Duct Tape

<Reactor|Jedi> PaladinDrakkenwolf: I think you're imagining it
<otakon> FLUFFLE PUFF!
<CriticKitten> I wouldn't say it's "nostalgia" persay. The original trilogy isn't legendary in the movie industry for being "meh", it's a great series. Yes the story's "generic", but it's well directed, well shot, and of a quality rarely seen in modern films.
<XylemTube> lol i know
<otakon> USE FLUFFLE PUFF!
<Thrackerzod> what is this?
<Pudge> OCTY

<Calcos323> GORG LUKES IN LUFF
<Squallken> ive had a great time, good ngiht
<Squallken> night*
<CriticKitten> I'd say it's grossly unfair to give it a low rating for a generic story when it's clearly not a generic level movie. It's a very good film, generic story aside. :p

<Reactor> mishia: I know what that's like
<Kandarihu> Oh, oops. My mind was split between thanking SlurryMoon for streaming and giving Dark92Enigma my take on the difference between a non-brony and an anti-brony.
<Kandarihu> Thanks for streaming, SlurryMoon
<mishia> Reactor: *gives you a famous Mishia huggle*
*Quick_Thinker the buffer-o-meter explodes into a fiery pulp

<ponibas> inb4 sleeping pill
<Eddmario> Don't worry, the links are SFW
<mishia> Reactor: :D
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, my take on it is that a non-brony doesn't really care one way or another. A non-brony views FiM with about as much respect as most bronies views... well, that news channel we were talking about earlier.
<DB_Brony> Eddmario: I love those drawings
<Ponies47> Eddmario: XD
<Eddmario> So, who's played Gears of Halo Theft Auto 6?
*DJPON3 what do?
<hen3ry> Ironically, both FiM and Faux are equally accurate in reporting current news. And at nearly the same age level.
<RainBowJack> Suddenly Rainbow Dash is next to you WHAT DO?
<hec-3rm> Does anypony play league of legends?
<Kandarihu> Dangit. I didn't want to get into another argument about it.
<Eddmario> hec-3rm Sometimes I uninstall TF2 and install Lol
<Reactor> RainBowJack: Brohoof her
*DJPON3 hug dashie, that's what do
<Eddmario> Make cupcakes
<mishia> Kandarihu: well, you can be an anti-brony and like MLP FIM. one of my friends loves the show but hates bronies, because hes always been around the creepy fapping bronies. :( so it kinda ruined his take on bronies, so he will be nice to bronies as long as they dont refrance fan materials.
<Marx> So superBrony64! Someone made a playable of the pony version of Faithful Farmer. Not as easy as you and the youtube videos make it out to be, but I am a quick learner, so I'm kinda getting the hang of it.
<Kandarihu> mishia, good point.
<superretroworld> Note: youre most likely a non brony when watching the first pony video for the first time
<otakon> brb
<appledash6> boop
<Ponies47> mishia: Well that's dumb. He likes ponies but hates bronies
<Eddmario> mishia: You and your friend DO know some cloppers do have standards, right?
<Quick_Thinker> your a quick learner and im a quick thinker :) my god do i love my name
<XylemTube> is the show over now?
<Reactor> XylemTube: looks like it
<mishia> Ponies47: he was around cloppers and the creepy ones. and he was only shown REALLY BAD fan material. Eddmario: i know cloppers have standards. Dint make it any less bad for him though. he got some of the worst, ok?
*DJPON3 wake up and see fluttershy flank. what do?
<Quick_Thinker> well the shows not done yet some one will stream eventually either that or they are having problems
<mishia> its not somones fault to like a show but dislike the fanbase
<Ponies47> mishia: Ah the cloppers. Cloppers don't bug me.
<mishia> me nethier
<superretroworld> Quick_Thinker: i wish i was you, im a brain dead thinker
<mishia> its there prefrance, why bother. he just really dint liek it .-.
<XAX|BlackOps> the numbers, mason.
<Eddmario> SuperBrony64: How long til next stream?
<Quick_Thinker> uh suppertroworld no you do wish you were me my motto is this IM A QUICK THINKER NOT X THINKER
<DJPON3> so who was phone?!?
<Eddmario> hec-rm: Like this
<xisbestchemical> hey guys
<mishia> wait a sec, i wanna change my name
<Reactor> Hi, xisbestchemical
<Quick_Thinker> which my motto can apply to many things
<Eddmario> mishia: Then type /nick and follow it up with the new name
<Dj-pwn-3> Ok
<Dj-pwn-3> name altered

<Quick_Thinker> how did you gain + 4 trust TAHT MAKES NO SENSE
<CrimsonPhoenix> xisbestchemical, mind my own business and move on
<Eddmario> xisbestchemical: Ask them if they've seen the show
<Quick_Thinker> educate the non brony hater on MLP and bring up the shows music and fanbase
<CrimsonPhoenix> why would I even care for him?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Try a option that wont piss him off
<RainBowJack> xisbestchemical : love and tolarate the S*yay* out of him
<xisbestchemical> lol
<Reactor> I'm with CrimsonPhoenix on that one

<xisbestchemical> crimsonpheonix i see ur point, if he is an anti-bony he might not have seen the show, so why waste time on it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God.. some people are stupid in my Wow realm's trade chat
<CrimsonPhoenix> xisbestchemical, also it's opinions
<Ponies47> Ok I was PMing with somepony. What are we talking about right now? 6_9
<CrimsonPhoenix> Loving MLP isn't obligatory
<Reactor> Ponies47: Ponies
<Dj-pwn-3> xisbestchemical: if he has seen the show, seriously leave him alone. its his right to hate it, and unless hes being rude to you our insulting you/bronies, leave him be
<CrimsonPhoenix> yet you guys make it seems so
<Quick_Thinker> well some eductation of the show couldnt hurt all that much it might even change his mood
<Ponies47> Ponies? Did you say ponies?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CrimsonPhoenix: I dislike the fans who are either like it or die
<Reactor> I did
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Make us look like a fucking cult
<Quick_Thinker> NEVER EVER ASK FOR POINES OH GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONEEEEEEE
<Dj-pwn-3> Note: insulting bronies means callign them all somthing rude. saying they may like internet more, like ponies, or are old isnt a insult
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], I share the same opinion
<Dj-pwn-3> SpadeMagnes[R]: *nod*
<Reactor> Quick_Thinker: But Sea Ponies are awesome! :D
<Dj-pwn-3> SpadeMagnes[R]: why cant we just leave them alone if they arent being rude to us??
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Some people take jabs at us too seriously

<Dj-pwn-3> SpadeMagnes[R]: fox making fun of us, for example, is just cause they dont understand. and because they are doing thier jobs. whatever, think what they think. they will be loved

<SpadeMagnes[R]> It bugged me the pokemon dub called them jelly donuts...
<Polydunami> Yeah, I was about to say that xD
<Vordox> SHOCKERS
<Alpha-Omega> moron
<Reactor> SpadeMagnes[R]: Really? Jelly doughnuts?
<Polydunami> They called soup "hamburgers" at one point, IIRC
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Reactor: Yea they called them jelly donuts
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And they changed a rice ball rolling down a hill into a sub sandwich
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Which makes no sense
<Vordox> Shatterings torpedos O.o
<SpadeMagnes[R]> REUSED CLIPS
<Reactor> I guess they were trying to "Americanize" it
<FlaschenJoe11> You talking about Pokemon dub?
<Polydunami> Yeah, because America is the only country in the world :|
<Vordox> EMPS!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Reactor: It makes me think they think kids are stupid
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Try educating them what onigiri are...
<Polydunami> Did they use this clip before?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Cant be that hard to say they're balls of rice
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: It's because of such shows some kids ARE stupid.
<Reactor> SpadeMagnes[R]: They definitely think kids are stupid
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: it was because somethings they though and were probly right was that americans would not understand the idea behind it. but seriously, the rice ball thing was nothing that would fly over there heads. theres stuff why more likly to do that then riceballs
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5896mn Where's your god now?
<DB_Brony> And If you tell anyone I will come to your house and I will cut you
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know still being a Princess when no one outranks you makes no sense
<Quick_Thinker> i remember watching an american anime and i could instantly tell they had americanized it and i was at the age of 5
<Mishia> Reactor: yep. they really do.
<DB_Brony> CrimsonPheonix: My interest is peaked!
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: I only like one AMerican anime... Avatar.

<Reactor> And I was forced to become internationalised
<Vordox> Mishia: Lawl, saying American has Animes
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This one line in the article bothers me
<Quick_Thinker> well think of it this way at least they didnt try to song the theme in enlgish they were nice enough to not do that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, I'm off to bed
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Make the show as envelope-pushing as you like… but when it comes to knowing what the girls in the audience want, we’re following Disney’s lead.

<Mishia> Its a really good movie, because its just nostagia and some cutness and conversation, no plot holes because there is no plot
<Mishia> just someone living thier life :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God I hate stereotypes
<Polydunami> SuperBrony64, how many discs is the entire show on?
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: unless you do somthing good with them or make them less obvious: the main 6
<Polydunami> Also, dat Twilight Saga :|
<Reactor> SpadeMagnes[R]: Stereotypes make me rage
<GabeMoist> Why isn't the stream loading for me?
<Mishia> Reactor: unless
<Quick_Thinker> DUHHHHHHHH LETS WATCH THE TWILIGHT MOVIES
<Quick_Thinker> they are sooooooo goooodd
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Realisticly Celestia should be a Queen because no one outranks her
<Alpha-Omega> same here stereotypes suck
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: DONT LOOK AT IT, IT WILL MAKE YOU BRAIN COME OUT YOUR EYES
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This Collection 1 has 20 episodes.
<Kandarihu> There is a very prevalent attitude towards the makers of childrens animation that young children aren't intelligent, so everything has to be dumbed down. It's pretty much the mentality that G3.5 and G3.6 was developed around.
*Quick_Thinker kills the imposter and burns his body
<DB_Brony> GabeMoist: Try and Re-try again
<Mishia> seriously people
<Polydunami> Oh dear, that's maybe the first half of the show.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I was pretty smart as a kid
<GabeMoist> Been trying for 20 minutes
<Quick_Thinker> okay what did i type a few seconds ago while i went and got something to drink
<SuperBrony64> 11,02"Directed by Hideaki Anno and produced by GAINAX (Neon Genesis Evangelion)"
<DB_Brony> Kandarihu: also dumbed down work is a lot easier to make so often times people opt to use that
<Polydunami> Otherwise known as "The Better Half".
<Mishia> aren't even rembering that the main 6 are basicly sterotypes mangaed into intresting charters???
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: And storywise created by Miyasaki
<DB_Brony> GAbeMoist: TRY HARDER
<Vordox> ;)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The way they dumb down stuff makes it look like we're retarded
<Polydunami> Hmm?
<GabeMoist> Not much else I can do
<Quick_Thinker> i found you
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: reason why i whatch older shows from at least before the 2007's
<kirzstryfe> 8,6sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
<Ingwaz> Mishia: theyre not just stereotypes. they have well developed characters. yes, each one of them embodies a few stereotypical traits, but they are not limited by those traits
<GabeMoist> G'night Kirz

<Mishia> RECAPTIME
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I didn't even know what Europe was as a child...and I still don't :3

<Dovah> ah Kandarihu lighten up I'm American and I'm bashing on america
<Mishia> MMMMRRRGHHH

<Malmortius> Guys, guys, hey guys. I made the arbiter in Spore. http://www.pictars.com/users/blessedspirit/Arbiter.jpg
<Mishia> SuperBrony64: i see where this came from
<Malmortius> When will they make a spore 2 :
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It got old after the first few times
<FlaschenJoe11> In Black and White (or Best Wishes) They aren't actually.
<Ponies47> Awww I missed saying goodnight to kirz! :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> FlaschenJoe11: They actually gave up?
<Mishia> Annnd
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This came before the Pokemon anime :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It took them what... 5 seasons?
<Mishia> drops outta the sky
<Mishia> derp
<FlaschenJoe11> No, they do Important missions SpadeMagnes[R]. And they SUCCEED!!!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> FlaschenJoe11: Pfff

<Vordox> "WE CAN BE SAVED"
<Vordox> "NOPE EVERMIND"
<Reactor> "That doesn't look right"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What the fuck is the Blue Water
<Polydunami> The Blue Water is an amulet. A mysterious amulet.
<Vordox> LAWL
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: a amulet. no idea what the hell it does or why they want it
<FlaschenJoe11> I think Those are SO going to make a Heel Face Turn.
<Alpha-Omega> are they from the circus?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ded
<Polydunami> Are they THAT predictable?
<Mishia> SuperBrony64: nope-nevermind
<Quick_Thinker> NICE PILOTING ACE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I really hated the team rocket disguises
<Quick_Thinker> AAHAHAHAHA XD
<Mishia> wow. such class O_O
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Alot of them were really obvious
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is... The Chronicles of Nadia
<Reactor> Well, I'm going to bed. Have to be up in 6 hours. Goodnight everyone!
<Mishia> SuperBrony64: i see what you did there
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: They now wear more Trenchcoats and GREY Uniforms.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I gave up on pokemon after the gold and silver season
<Polydunami> Seriously, why does Nadia look like Shinji?
<Mishia> FlaschenJoe11: and are now really badass spies that make you miss them....
<Quick_Thinker> how long will it take for her to realize they had a crash
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CHIEF....WAKE UP JOHN....WE NEED YOU!!
<Polydunami> Whoops, it's the other way around :S
<SpadeMagnes[R]> SEIRRA 117!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: for some reason the movies are still really great to whatch and have some vissual "wows'
<Kandarihu> SuperBrony64, since he's French, his name is most likely Jean
<Quick_Thinker> all over the place kid
<FlaschenJoe11> Mishia: They appear every second episode or so. At least for the first 15. (Never saw past ep 15. Got to do that.)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I wasn't talking about /that/ Jean :3
<Polydunami> Not quite the first time these guys get stranded :|
<Vordox> LAWL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Apperently alot of the pokemon in gold and silver were supposed to be in red blue and yellow
<Vordox> KKB
<Quick_Thinker> the fuck
<FlaschenJoe11> The Klan?
<Alpha-Omega> the kkk?
<Polydunami> Oh geeze, here comes Gargoyle.
<Kandarihu> Sorry
*AttackAndalite|Zzz goes to bed and hugs the chat goodnight
<Capfluttershy> i just got here...what is this?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<FlaschenJoe11> Jean is trying TOO hard for a Accent if you ask me.
<Polydunami> Also, dead people.
<HatchetRyda> nite AttackAndalite|Zzz love you :)
<Quick_Thinker> NOT THE DOGGGGGGGGGGG
<Vordox> FOR KIIIIDZ
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The dog died ;A;
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Was gold and silver even out at the time in japan when the first season of pokemon came out?
<Quick_Thinker> purple blood?
<Polydunami> There was a kid there.
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], nope
<Polydunami> Oh no, the kid...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Who cares about the people!? THE DOG DIED ;A;
<Quick_Thinker> seriously that blood looks purple
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kandarihu: Then why did they put Ho-oh in the first episode?
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: oh god, watch the movies. alot of them are worth it, because they use EFFORT to promote the legendaires, and the stories are pretty good. the archas one was fun since they came to the time when pokemon WERENT the only animals about or might not have been, and are used as enslaved magical creatures. they dont try to hide it, im serious
<FlaschenJoe11> The Girl is fine. She was in the Title Sequence.
<noname> SuperBrony64: Ikr :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know what is annoying about the pokemon dub?
<Capfluttershy> WHAT IS THIS?!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There was a banned safari episode
<Quick_Thinker> oh the safaria episode
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Capfluttershy: Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: SpadeMagnes[R] the one with james in a swimsuit?
<Polydunami> Oh hey, the kid is fine! She's just sleeping in the arms of HER DEAD MOTHER. Isn't that just dandy? :|
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It never got aired in america so Ash gets 30 taros out of NOWHERE
<Capfluttershy> oh
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: That was because the Park keeper pulled a Revolver on Ash.
<Capfluttershy> KITTY!!
<Quick_Thinker> cant keep quite
<Capfluttershy> i think..
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea but he gets 30 tauros out of nowhere
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: team rocket uses guns alot....in the japnese verison. and there boss loves his cigrattes. Jessus, they think kids cant handle dis shit?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MARIE :D
<Kandarihu> It's some sort of Japanese mythology that the episode was invoking. Later on, they designed a Legendary Pokemon for Generation 2 after the Pokemon that Satoshi saw.
<Capfluttershy> YO MOM IS DEAD
<FlaschenJoe11> They never aired it in Germany either. We got the american version to dub over ourselves. SpadeMagnes[R]
<Quick_Thinker> a lion?
<Capfluttershy> ded
<Quick_Thinker> i thouht he was a dog
<Mishia> cwueeeee!
<Quick_Thinker> oh well
<Quick_Thinker> that makes me a idot
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know because of that one episode Porygon and its evos have never been in the show
<Mishia> O__________________________________________________O
<Vordox> BUT I WANT IT NAO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02;A;
<FlaschenJoe11> "Soon you will" THEY GONNA KILL THE KID!!
<OtakuTom> Okay, I'm back
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It wasnt even Porygon who caused it
<Quick_Thinker> uhhhhhhhh THEY ARE HIDING VERY VERY WELL KIDDO
<Mishia> *sniff*
<HatchetRyda> well i'm off to bed, nite guys
<Polydunami> Marie is so cute <3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night HatchetRyda :)
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], a sign depicting Porygon2 was seen in one episode. But besides that, you're right.
<Vordox> "okay.?"
<Mishia> dat title screen ruins the mood
*HatchetRyda hugs SuperBrony64
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pikachu actualy caused the seizure
<Mishia> UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH
<Polydunami> SAY WHAT AGAIN!
<Quick_Thinker> the mask are killing me XD
<Polydunami> These guys are pretty much the main villains.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> PING
<Quick_Thinker> and why do they not think the team rocket villians arent the surviors
<Mishia> SpadeMagnes[R]: oh the sezuire deal? the show flashes all the time. It causes tons of seziures on its own. besdies, what happened to putting that "sezuire warning" anyway?
<Mishia> seriously....
<Quick_Thinker> they were near the crash
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hope he doesnt run into Zapdos
<Mishia> *_*
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], Pikachu is the mascot and therefore above reproach. And Porygon is made of code, and is technically not alive and therefore completely expendable.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh wait wrong universe
<FlaschenJoe11> In Pokemon best wishes, they mention Ash's age too. 10!!! He NEVER AGED A DAY!!!
<Mishia> oh no.
<Mishia> oh no
<BaconMane> 0,5Night
<Mishia> NOOOOOO
<Polydunami> Goodnight BaconMane!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know whats the most bullshit thing?
<FlaschenJoe11> Flashback
<Bronysith> night BM
<FlaschenJoe11> night Bacon.
<Bronysith> soorrry. BaconMane
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pikachu lost to a snivy that never battled
<Quick_Thinker> people weeping
<Mishia> OMG NOOOOOOOOOO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oh god ;A;
<crazypony> :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It was total bullshit
*Vordox hugs SuperBrony64
<Polydunami> You know, calling these guys KKK isn't that far off, now that I think about it.
*SuperBrony64 hugs Vordox back ;A;
<Mishia> this is more sad because shes telling a little kid's verison of death
<Quick_Thinker> uhhhhhhh damn this show takes death quite serious
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: That was because of Plot. He got hit by Uber Lightning before that.
<otakon> Holy shit old anime
<SpadeMagnes[R]> FlaschenJoe11: He has non electrical moves
<FlaschenJoe11> So I can forgive THAT.
<Kandarihu> The only logical explanation to Satoshi still being 10 years old is assuming that all of his adventures took place in the span of less than one year.
<otakon> who is streaming?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So there is no excuse
<Quick_Thinker> mortor fire and shoot outs
<Vordox> Just so you know, SuperBrony64. We all have genuine unknowingly got into this and most of us have NEVER seen this. :P
<Vordox> So this is all pure "First seen"
<Mishia> dont cry little kid *pets*
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kandarihu: But in one episode they celebrate him and pikachu being together for a year
<otakon> I've seen this in old anime catalogs
<Mishia> 5!
<Polydunami> These guys are pretty much the Nazis of the show.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So thats bullshit
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is the first time I'm seeing this either :3
<Quick_Thinker> 1 2 5
<Polydunami> And that's all I have to say on it.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: I hear it's a classic series
<FlaschenJoe11> Jean is Badass...European?
<DB_Brony> too bad he doen't know how to count past 4
<Quick_Thinker> XD
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], then it's officially a plothole.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02otakon: I figured O.O
<Mishia> shoot them as soon as they come out O_O
<Mishia> whhhhhhat
<otakon> RUN DAMMIT!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean Pikachu should not have lost to that snivy
<Quick_Thinker> damn this anime or show or whatever you want to call it rocks
<FlaschenJoe11> The KKK-guy is at least Genre Savvy.
<Polydunami> You know, I've watched the entire show at one point.
<Mishia> the other villians were causal people with calss. these people- OH GOD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He has non electrical moves to use
<Quick_Thinker> GENIUS
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: it's a older one thats for sure
<Ponies47> http://www.funnyjunk.com/channel/ponytime/Where+Little+Ponies+come+from/vpecGic/ XD
<XylemTube> UNDERSTOOD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There is no fucking excuse for pikachu losing
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: Ash was an Idiot. Because of Idiot Ball.
<Bronysith> http://www.dorkly.com/comic/30748/skyrim-hoarders
<otakon> I just got done playing some SPAZ
<otakon> it's pretty good
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And you know what sucks?
<Kandarihu> All of this happening in less than one year certainly explains why he hasn't become more experienced, except for the fact that he's a young child and therefore capable of improving himself much better than an adult could.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ash is never going to become a champion because of new games
<Vordox> Bronysith: And this is related how?
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: That is the saddest part. He is forever trapped in Time and Fate of Losing.
<Polydunami> Jean is serious :O
<Bronysith> Vordox: cause lootsack of crushing
<Vordox> ..
<Quick_Thinker> i like how they are dealing with death its how most kids would try to handle it with other kids
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean he could have been a Frontier brain.. AND HE TURNED IT DOWN
<Bronysith> http://catmacros.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/cat-halp-1-1.jpg?w=720
<Vordox> What is related to either the anime,or pony?
<FlaschenJoe11> Polydunami: Of course. He is a European Badass!! I think.
<otakon> Oh look
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], if they ever want to retire Satoshi, they could have him win a league, and let the next season follow a new character.
<otakon> Team Rocket Prototypes
<Bronysith> wait. isnt this anime have something to do with tentacle rape?
<Polydunami> Umm, no?
<otakon> Also remind me of that one chick from Tonoko
<Kandarihu> But indeed. He's been de-aged to 10 as of Best Wishes.
<otakon> Bronysith: dear God no
<Quick_Thinker> why is it alaways that some how anime is lead to tentacle rape?
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: the thing is it doesn't
<FlaschenJoe11> Kandarihu: They won't do that. As well as we will never know WHO Satoshi's/Ash's Father is.
<Quick_Thinker> or hentia
<Polydunami> No, I watched the show and I remember nothing about tentacle rape.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ash is still incompetent
<Kandarihu> Quick_Thinker, it's a cliche of hentai, or so I hear from everybody.
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: In Diamond and Pearl he was competent. Somewhat.
<Vordox> Damn....
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also may I ask how dipping a Magmar in lava beats it?
<Vordox> I just pierced my finger with my beard
<Vordox> ._.
<otakon> Kandarihu: it's a hentai cliche, originally meant to be scary but then they found out some liked the idea.... yikes.
<otakon> Vordox: ouch I've done that before
<Kandarihu> He had a hardcore rival in Diamand and Pearl.
<FlaschenJoe11> Vordox: You got a Stekk Beard!
<FlaschenJoe11> *Steel
<otakon> Vordox: eyebrow hair
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The rival in Diamond and Pearl was a douche
<Vordox> Yeah but did your pierce the WHOLE finger?
<Vordox> :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And isnt Gary the same age as Ash?
<Quick_Thinker> burying the bodies?
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like a pogostick
<FlaschenJoe11> I liked Gary best, as Rival. And Ash's victory against him was satisfactory.
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], perhaps. But Shinji's technique was more effective.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how the hell is Gary able to drive a car?
<Sumica> 00,10he has swag
<otakon> Vordox: no, but I did have my eyebrow hair sticking quite a bit in my finger.
<Vordox> otakon: Always fun when it happens
<Vordox> I GOT HAIR OF STEEL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He shouldent be allowed to drive
<FlaschenJoe11> SpadeMagnes[R]: Because he is Gary Mother****** Oak. And don't you forget about it.
<Quick_Thinker> when does Gary drive a car?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Quick_Thinker: several times
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I guess Satoshi keeps getting de-aged. Shigeru is allowed to grow up.
<Polydunami> AFK
<otakon> well simple
<Vordox> You wanna go
<Vordox> Ok
<Vordox> BANG
<otakon> let her jump off the cliff
<Vordox> Jean's....Family?
<FlaschenJoe11> dat sad accent.
<otakon> Vordox: no I don't think so.
<Quick_Thinker> very nice fandub
<noname> feels
<Vordox> You know...
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: fandub?
<Vordox> You remember your first time encountering death of a family or friend?
<Quick_Thinker> someone said it was a fandub
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: pretty sure this is the official dub.
<Vordox> Your very first time when you knew what it meant?
<FlaschenJoe11> Just one question. Will this end like most other Gainax Series?
<Vordox> Or learnt to understand it
<otakon> FlaschenJoe11: it's not GAINAX iirc
<Spectrum_Rush|> otakon: it is
<otakon> I wonder what Project A-Ko would be under movie wise.....
<Polydunami> I'm back. What did I miss? :3
<Quick_Thinker> my first encounter with death was my pet bunny getting his foot stuck in a cage and starving whille we went on vaction
<otakon> Polydunami: they buried the little girls parents
<Polydunami> Yeah, I remember that.
<Kandarihu> This is Gainax, but it's Gainax the way they were before they were driven to hire on Hideaki Anno to do... whatever he wanted to do.
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony, may the force be with you all and may you pierce the heavens with your drill
<FlaschenJoe11> otakon: okay. But this IS the show that broke Hideaki Anno.
<otakon> night Bronysith
<otakon> FlaschenJoe11: wait wait, BROKE him?
*FlaschenJoe11 brohugs Bronysith "Night Man"
<Alpha-Omega> First experience of death. My friend died in my bathroom at age of 8
<FlaschenJoe11> otakon: The tight schedule made him Stress out and become depressive later on.
<otakon> FlaschenJoe11: and then we got goddamn NGE
<otakon> argh
<Kandarihu> Alpha-Omega, wow.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> According to the article Blueblood was supposed to be a Duke
<otakon> Looks like Captain Global
<FlaschenJoe11> otakon: we got the BAD NGE. Rebuild is better.
<Alpha-Omega> I miss him.
<CrimsonPhoenix> NHK?
<otakon> FlaschenJoe11: yeah but it's still "IT GOT WORSE" catergory
<CrimsonPhoenix> Conspiracy :o
<FlaschenJoe11> otakon: It's supposed to end better than the original. or the past of the universe. It's still very Mind Screwy there.
<Polydunami> My Uncle Sam died when I was five.
<otakon> FlaschenJoe11: damn show I don't like it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami, He needed you.
<Polydunami> I can't believe I had an Uncle Sam of all things xD
<otakon> damn smart kid
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh it's wanted.....
<otakon> being able to map out the island
<FlaschenJoe11> I like NGE. It's the mindscrewy enough to be fun. And I like Shinji.
<OtakuTom> NGE was the first anime I owned on DVD. I absolutely love the show (minus the last 2 episodes). I thought Death & Rebirth and EoE were okay, but I absolutely love the Rebuild movies.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's....creepier
<otakon> crazy ass steampunk tanks
<Polydunami> I called him Grandpa because my real grandpa died ten years before I was bown.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm going to bed good night
<otakon> night SpadeMagnes[R]
<Polydunami> Goodnight SpadeMagnes
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom: Rebuild Shinji vs EoE Shinji. WHO WINS?
<Alpha-Omega> Good nht
<otakon> FlaschenJoe11: neither, we lose.
<Kandarihu> Evangelion was meant to be a deconstruction of mecha series at the time.
<noname> mail hawtler?
<Quick_Thinker> loud kid
<FlaschenJoe11> otakon: Wrong. Rebuild Shinji wins and THEN we die.
<OtakuTom> Oooh...uhhh...tough question...
<Quick_Thinker> why can never just read his thoguhts so he doesnt have to make sounds
<Kandarihu> It's amazing how so many notable examples of pretty much any genre is a deconstruction of it. And this works in the west as well.
<Polydunami> Who, Jean?
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom I like SRW Alpha Shinji too.
<Quick_Thinker> would make more sense and also be less loud
<Vordox> It's a DESERT
<otakon> welp he's dead
<FlaschenJoe11> Jean is a bit of a badass.
<OtakuTom> SRW Alpha...oh Super Robot Wars? I can't say I've seen or played any SRW other than the one DS game that was released in the US.
<Polydunami> Yep
<otakon> so, that group moved in and captured the local populace huh?
<Kandarihu> Gundam was a deconstruction of Super Robot, Macross was a parody of mecha, Nadesico was a parody of Real Robot, Evangelion was a dark deconstruction of Super Robot..... Madoka Magicka was a dark deconstruction of Magical Girl Warrior.
<Alpha-Omega> bullets shatter on impact on the surface of the water as tested by mythbusters
<otakon> Kandarihu: dear God Madoka, neve NEVER want to read it
<otakon> Alpha-Omega: yh at 6 feet
<Vordox> Alpha-Omega: Don't forget Bullet Types
<otakon> Alpha-Omega: his head was still above the water
<otakon> he wasn't deep enough
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom: He got Bright-Slapped in Alpha and then saved Asuka from the MPEvas. When I played Alpha 3 he was my favourite Unit.
<Kandarihu> otakon, Madoka Magicka is anime first. The manga is an adaptation of the anime.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat dancing
<otakon> Kandarihu: never.want.to.see.it.too.depressing.
<Vordox> LAWL
<OtakuTom> Oooh...Madoka Magicka...I'm just starting to watch that.
<OtakuTom> I'm only on episode 2
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Have fun
<Vordox> DO NOT GET SPOILED
<FlaschenJoe11> Jean and Nadia SO want to jump each others bones.
<FlaschenJoe11> I can FEEL the UST.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: It isn't that time of the month here though Shizuka...
<otakon> Shizuka: good luck dear, I'm off to bed.
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, I should hope it's a FttH startup in your town.
<otakon> Take care all! See you tomorrow sometime eh?
<otakon> at least I hope.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Then again, Comcast has been flawless for me lately >>
<RK9> One does not simply "OP".
<RK9> frick.
<Vordox> ....
<Vordox> Borrowed...
<RK9> is that the only rank this server has?
<FlaschenJoe11> Vordox: it's nicer than saying stole.
<RK9> or do you have p-ops, h-op?
<OtakuTom> That squeak was cute X3
<Vordox> DO I SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH IN THE ENEMY TERRITORY!?
<Kandarihu> I'll bet those power conduits are insulated.
<Polydunami> What if Jean were voiced by Samuel L. Jackson?
<FlaschenJoe11> Why do I think that Jean's accent is too forced?
<Vordox> Kandarihu: 120 years ago?
<Polydunami> French accent and everything? xD
<Kandarihu> Vordox, good point.
<Alpha-Omega> I also think the same
<Polydunami> Jean's VA was trained in the art of the French accent, actually.
<Polydunami> ... Allegedly :S
<Sumica> 00,10kick there colective asses Shizuka
<FlaschenJoe11> Polydunami: he overuses it though. It SOUNDS forced.
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> YES
<Mishia> hm
<OtakuTom> Yea, I really don't like his voice.
<Mishia> that animalcrossing Creepypasta shure did hit a curveball with the story...dint see it coming O_O

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Gently please...
<Kandarihu> I have a perfectly stable synchronous speed on my FttH service. But there's one thing Comcast has that I don't. IPv6.

<Polydunami> Why not?
<FlaschenJoe11> please.
<Vordox> PLOX
<Quick_Thinker> think of it this way she doesnt die
<Mishia> i want to see the mystical artifact buck up the ass with him
<Vordox> You perv Mishia
<Quick_Thinker> ^ waht?
<Mishia> you know what mystical artifacts do to people .+.
<Vordox> I don't understand women and girls
<Kandarihu> I don't want to miss this, but I gotta sleep
<Vordox> Always so pervy
<Vordox> *shakes head*
<Alpha-Omega> drive them insane
<OtakuTom> This show is better than I remember it being. I stopped after the first 4 episodes a long time ago and never watched the rest.
<Mishia> Vordox: that wasnt ment that way
<FlaschenJoe11> Mishia: I only know they are known to possess or outright kill people.
<Vordox> Mishia: Too late =P
<Mishia> FlaschenJoe11: pretty mucgh
<Mishia> Vordox: ......
<Quick_Thinker> well i was gonna play some new Pony songs on Stepmania but they can wait
<Sumica> 00,10I have an anime that is kinda alot like this one only more mind fucky
<FlaschenJoe11> Mishia: OR they grant you awesome Superpowers with which you protect your friends and save the world.
<OtakuTom> What anime, Sumi?
<Sumica> 00,10Fractal
<Mishia> Mishia: buuuuut hes not the owner of that amulet!
<Quick_Thinker> or they can change you into a Pony :D
<Alpha-Omega> sound like my kind of anime
<magmablock> What a random looking band of misfits
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: BEST.CURSE.EVER
<OtakuTom> Can't say I've seen that one...lol
<Sumica> 00,10might stream an ep if there is time
<Quick_Thinker> if thats the case the artfact is awesome
<Eulshy> the heck are we watching?
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: but only if its a MLPFIM pony. i mean, if you turned into a normal pony, it would suck.
<Quick_Thinker> of course it would
<FlaschenJoe11> You know. If it wasn't that bad, as in it doesn't explain the reason for a character Motive, I would suggest someone to stream Fate/Stay Night: The Anime.
<Polydunami> It's kind of strange how the Grandis Gang is grouped with the Nadia troupe in the very OP.
<Eulshy> the heck we watching?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I hope I can download the rest of the episodes of this show after I finish through all the DVDs
<Mishia> i mean, i only like ponies as in MLPFIM ponies. they are gorgeous and are acutally fun to be
<Quick_Thinker> so would being turned into a G3.5 PONY i would just end it all then and there
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Or buy ? :)
<Mishia> i mean, they have perks!
<Eulshy> The heck we watching?
<OtakuTom> Eulshy, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water
<Eulshy> OtakuTom: Fank you
<Kandarihu> To be honest, I'm kind of partial to the kinds of anime that NHK shows. It doesn't rely on fanservice or lots of action or flashy mecha design. There's a sense of purity to series like that.
<Mishia> NO
<Sabershy> FlaschenJoe11: Wouldn't Fate/zero be a better stream?
<Mishia> NOT THE KID!
<Eulshy> is that a cat?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vordox: Well...it's old ><
<Polydunami> Lion, actually. A cub
<Mishia> dont say anything
<Sumica> 00,10kerbals are made of darkmater
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<Mishia> lol
<Sumica> 00,10they fall faster then the ship they jumpfrom
<Vordox> O.o
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom, you have that prepped don't you? and Sabershy: First LOVE THE NAME and second, it would spoil many of the reveals and twists of Fate/Stay Night.
<Eulshy> So technically a cat still
<Mishia> O______________O
<Mishia> GOD IN A ANIME! BLASTPHAMY!
<Mishia> lol no
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O_O;;;
<Polydunami> How about Belldandy? :3
<noname> D:
<Quick_Thinker> damn this guy doesnt fuck arounf
<Eulshy> dat lion cub
<Mishia> you know this doesnt work
<Kandarihu> Nadia's picking a lie and sticking to it.
<Mishia> if you kill her, you will never get it
<Mishia> you tard
<Quick_Thinker> wait doesnt she want to die to go to heaven? just saying
<Sumica> 00,10he kinda reminds me of amon
<OtakuTom> Have what prepped, the title?
<Polydunami> In the ocean O_O
<Mishia> like if you have one hostage and you threaten him
<FlaschenJoe11> Sabershy: I AM watching Fate/Zero on my own right now. Since I played the original VN. Which actually EXPLAINS WHY Shirou is the Hero type he is.
<Quick_Thinker> kid is fucked
<Eulshy> So what is this show about exactly?
<Mishia> and he turns on you, and slaps you. what can you do? he walks out and you shoot him DERP now yours screwed
<OtakuTom> Is there an English version of the Fate/Stay Night VN?
<Vordox> I am not a mouse, I AM A FRENCH
<Vordox> ^
<FlaschenJoe11> Eulshy: it's loosely based on 20,000 Leagues under the sea.
<OtakuTom> Like an official one?
<Mishia> the villians are trapped by villians??!?
<Quick_Thinker> too bad team rocket
<Mishia> O_O
<Quick_Thinker> NOTHING TROLLOLOLOL
<Eulshy> What's 20,000 leagues under the sea?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02He actually reminds me of Lazarevic from Uncharted 2
<Vordox> LAWL
<Mishia> wow
<Quick_Thinker> huh
<Sabershy> FlaschenJoe11: 1) Thank you for the compliment. :$ 2) Yep. I wish I can stream Fate/zero for everyone....
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom: I think the MirrorMoon Translation is as Official as you can get.
<Mishia> loooooooooooooooooooool
<magmablock> "I'm the ambiguously gay one, by the way."
<OtakuTom> Ah
<Quick_Thinker> Team rocket wannabes are apparently very good fakers
<OtakuTom> I'm still hoping a company like MangaGamer localizes it. I picked up the Higurashi games and Shuffle from them.
<Quick_Thinker> EARTHQUAKE
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: they inspired team rocket.
<Quick_Thinker> oh did not know that
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: so wannabes? hell no
<FlaschenJoe11> Sabershy: Who's your favourite Servant in 1: F/SN and 2: F/Z?
<magmablock> whutizzles
<Alpha-Omega> team rocket originals
<Vordox> FlaschenJoe11: Shiki
<Quick_Thinker> oh Mishia its the first time i've seen this anime give me a break
<Polydunami> Making like Indy, huh?
<Sabershy> Vordox: :D
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: i am :3 i just decided to ARRRTAKKK u
<OtakuTom> I will hide in this train car full of oversized lego
<Kandarihu> Team Rocket are Griger Gang wannabees
<Quick_Thinker> ITS GENIUS
*Mishia pounces Quick_Thinker for good messure
<FlaschenJoe11> Mine are 1: GARcher and 2: Gilgamesh. Shiki is from Tsukihime. He doesn't count.
<Mishia> why are they treating her this way???????????????????
*Quick_Thinker why did you pounce me are you a pony cat ?
<Alpha-Omega> wine?
<magmablock> Bitch, food is food, just shut up
<Vordox> FlaschenJoe11: But...Shiki is in the same story as Fate Stay Night
<Vordox> :)
<Polydunami> Nadia is vegetarian.
<Quick_Thinker> XD
<noname> MAMAMMAMAMMAMAMAMMAMAMA
<Sabershy> FlaschenJoe11: Should be obvious, But I am learning towards Berserker in F/SN while Saber in F/z
<Mishia> hey its the lego tain!
<FlaschenJoe11> Vordox: If he's in the anime, haven't watched it. Or do you mean in the Heaven's Feel Route of the game? Haven't finished that one yet.
<Eulshy> GIANT LEGOS
<Mishia> :$
<Quick_Thinker> huh everyone is hungry
<Mishia> what the
<Vordox> FlaschenJoe11: Check it up. ;) Tsukihime Fate Stay Night
<Mishia> the skinny guy is the BRUTE and the fat one is the scientest. whut
<WalkerPony89> Panda: So uhh... find any of RD yet?
<Mishia> logic wins!
<WalkerPony89> Fuck
<FlaschenJoe11> Sabershy: What are your thoughts on Zero|Rider?
<WalkerPony89> Wrong chat
<OtakuTom> I've only seen 1 or 2 episodes of F/Z, but Saber in her suit has got to be one of the sexiest things I've ever seen.
<Quick_Thinker> RD you mean rainbowdash or something else?
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: of course
<noname> why do they need giant legos
<Polydunami> Oh man, she has no other clothes to sleep in?
<Mishia> Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaainbooooooooooooooooow
<Quick_Thinker> TO BUILD A LEGO HOUSE OF COURSE
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: TIME FOR THE TITLE SCREEN :3
<noname> Quick_Thinker: kinda sucks useing the same colour :l
<Quick_Thinker> they will paint them
<Eulshy> Sassy princess
<Quick_Thinker> now shush
<Mishia> noname: where is your name, n0n4me
<derpy_pony> good morning 6_9
<FlaschenJoe11> Vordox: You talking about Carnival Phantasm?
<Eulshy> Is Sassy
<OtakuTom> You really can't step on those lego at least...but laying down on them like that has still got to be incredibly uncomfortable...lol
<Vordox> FlaschenJoe11: I dunno. I just thout I read it somewhere
<noname> Mishia: it got taken away
<Mishia> why???
<Sumica> 00,10oh hey the ep of cake boss from my old job is on.
<Mishia> what the
<Quick_Thinker> WHY ARE THEY BEING NICE TO HER I DONT GET IT
<Sabershy> FlaschenJoe11: I liked Rider and his pompus ideas. He could have truly won the war if he actually TRULY wanted to win. All he needed was Emiya's or Tokiomi's mentality.
<Mishia> murders act pretty awesome
<FlaschenJoe11> Sabershy: No Spoiling for those that haven't seen the UBW movie at leas.
<OtakuTom> Oooh...I just got UBW on bluray
<Sabershy> Aww, shoot.
<OtakuTom> I haven't watched it yet :(
<FlaschenJoe11> or do you mean Kiritsugu?
<Quick_Thinker> huh so they are atlantis people MILLO GET YOU ASS OVER HERE NOW
<Vordox> OtakuTom: inb4 movie with epic scenes
<Alpha-Omega> crazy villian nutjob
<noname> invisable walls
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom: the Archer/Shirou Fight is SQUEE!!!
<magmablock> Is that a dog or cat?
<Quick_Thinker> its a box
<derpy_pony> textiles?
<OtakuTom> I take it I should finish watching F/SN before UBW? I can't remember if I ever finished the series...it's been a while since I watched it.
<Mishia> noname: the invisble wall of videogames, i know the rage you feel anime girl
<Quick_Thinker> its actually a baby lion
<Polydunami> That is a lion cub, magmablock
<noname> MORE LEGOS
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom: UBW is a parallell Universe to F/SN
<Eulshy> Legos?
<Polydunami> Nadia grew up in the circus, after all.
<Mishia> FlaschenJoe11: whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Sabershy> OtakuTom: Honestly yes. You are better off to reading the VN, but if you got no choice, watch the F/SN anime.
<OtakuTom> Okay, so it doesn't matter if I finished the series (which I should probably re-watch anyway...lol)
<noname> Eulshy: appearently, there making a lego house made of purple blocks only >_>
<FlaschenJoe11> The Anime focuses on the "Fate" Route while UBW is the "UBW" Route.
<Polydunami> Anyone remember the circus case from Phoenix Wright?
<Quick_Thinker> rock solo?
<magmablock> Doesn't Babel have a short a sound?
<Mishia> ITS PRONOUNCED THE TOWER OF BAB-EL
<Quick_Thinker> or not
<OtakuTom> I remember that case, Polydunami
<Eulshy> Purple is like the 4th best color, yellow s the best
<Mishia> bAHHHHbel
<Quick_Thinker> well its offical IM TOTALLY LOST
<OtakuTom> Ah
<Polydunami> Yeah, Regina Berry has a tiger for a pet.
<Polydunami> That right?
<Quick_Thinker> at first i thought it was a pirate with submarienes thing now its a fucking atlantis thing
<FlaschenJoe11> Quick_Thinker: It's based on 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. Of course it has Atlantis in it.
<noname> corrupted religon is corrupted
<Quick_Thinker> guess thats waht i get for only seeing the 4th episode and missing the first
<Sabershy> Quick_Thinker: Same here. Saw like the first 3 episodes here and the suddenly and Evil organization.
<Dovah> Bucking brony research... now I'm going to have to waste 20 hours of my life to watch all the episodes again :|
<Quick_Thinker> well if i knew that it would make more sense so forgive me now that i know 20,000 Leagues is involved
<magmablock> Rho-bits
<Mishia> Dovah: WASTE???
<Sumica> 00,10the problem with the threat of death card. You only get to play it once.
<Mishia> Dovah: wastttteeeee??????????????????????????????
<noname> Dovah: ponys are waste? :(
<derpy_pony> laws of narration: show your god device to the barbarians and they will destroy it in the same day
<Polydunami> How do you "waste time" watching My Little Pony?
<Quick_Thinker> Davah why are you watch all the episodes are you doing resaerch or something?
<FlaschenJoe11> Sabershy: You know what would have been IMBA? Archer or Z!Archer with Berserker's "Knight of Honor"
<Polydunami> Rule Britannia!
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: he might be doing this as reserch for school.
<Sumica> 00,10all hail opai
<Polydunami> Britannia rules the waves!
<Quick_Thinker> sorry can not grammer anymore to early in the morning

<Quick_Thinker> what kind of research would it be if its MLP FIM an animation reasearch or just a fun kind of research
<Quick_Thinker> ah i see
<Polydunami> Told you these guys were Nazis.
<FlaschenJoe11> Dovah: It's hard being a good guy, right?
<Dovah> Yursh
<Alpha-Omega> I still do that but I'm learning to draw the characters as well
<Quick_Thinker> i've been a brony as long as 5 months and i still have missed a few episodes
<Mishia> SUPRISE!
<Quick_Thinker> dont have to go overboard
<magmablock> Just over a year for me
<derpy_pony> if they were nazis, they would have unloaded the car. they are italians or something like that
<FlaschenJoe11> Deathstar?
<DeathStar> FlaschenJoe11: yes?
<FlaschenJoe11> Sorry, not you. Meant the Anime. :$
<DeathStar> FlaschenJoe11: ah ^^

<Quick_Thinker> also the 2 fics are one is a D&D campaign with ponys in them and the other is a crossover with Day Z and FIM
<Quick_Thinker> DAMN
<magmablock> Blammers
<noname> dat explosion
<OtakuTom> FlaschenJoe11, I've been a brony now for about a year and haven't contributed anything other than the OC I created in one of the flash pony creators.
<Polydunami> You haven't seen BLAM in this show yet.
<Quick_Thinker> i have not even made my OC yet
<Vordox> Dat Cliffhanger
<noname> ^
<Eulshy> weird anime
<Quick_Thinker> i kinda of made my OC in the D&D fic but my name literlay did come from the D&D thing so yeah
<Polydunami> Let's see... I got into this show about nine months ago...
<OtakuTom> Eh, my OC is named OtakuTom...kinda makes sense :P
<Vordox> I got into MLP back in the 1990s. :)
<OtakuTom> His cutie mark is a video game joystick...lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02One more episode or should I stream something else?
<FlaschenJoe11> OtakuTom: My OC looks mostly like me. Including my Shirt :D
<OtakuTom> Which, if you know me, makes sense, since I plan on getting into video game development.
<Quick_Thinker> well i might try to draw him so far he is unicorn and his cutie mark is an apple and a test tube (gravity and Chemistry)
<Vordox> I'm okay with both Supr
<noname> SuperBrony64: to big of a cliffhanger, one more
<FlaschenJoe11> And I plan to write a FanFic for months now. But I just can't get the time to start writing it seems.
<Polydunami> More episodes?
<Vordox> I'm okay with both Supr
<Mishia> MOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?
<Vordox> DANGIT
<crazypony> i've been a brony for 5 months now and i haven't even contributed to the community
<Alpha-Omega> Nah the cliffhanger is goos for effect
<OtakuTom> What I didn't realize is how much mine looks almost exactly like Wrek's, but I made it before I knew what his looked like...lol
<Mishia> im delteing my story....
<Mishia> to wright a better one!
<XAX> SuperBrony64: ...zombies
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Alright, one more...then maybeh Zombies 3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:3*
<Alpha-Omega> I want to do that with my story
<FlaschenJoe11> For those that haven't seen Scootamom yet: http://damaneman.deviantart.com/#/d4dlqaz
<Eulshy> BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD
<Vordox> I haven't contributed anything worthwhile to Bronys yet
<Vordox> :)
<Quick_Thinker> Mishia i did that with my Quick Thinker story (the name came from a RPG of MLP FIM so it was a legit character i played but he wore a freaking labcoat XD
<XAX> SuperBrony64: I was actually just doing a test on my own mips channel. just set black ops to windowed and turn down the resolution a tiny little. (though you probably already know this... >__>)
<Polydunami> I've been planning to write a Human in Equestria fic for a while, now. One that is actually good.
<Sumica> 00,10good luck Polydunami
<Quick_Thinker> good luck and try to get the emotions right
<Sumica> 00,10I have only seen 2 that I like
<Alpha-Omega> what type of zombies?
<noname> ^
<Polydunami> Not saying I'm actually going to write it.
<Quick_Thinker> well the zombie one im doing is the Day Z / MLP FIM crossover so far its on the 5th chapter
<Polydunami> I'm just saying maybe.
<Sumica> 00,10they have a satlight weapon?
<Sumica> 00,10oh hey it's captan gloval
<Polydunami> Won't work if it's self-insert.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Capitan Nemo, on duty ~
<FlaschenJoe11> I planned to write a Fic where Tirek (The Evil before Discord took over) returns and the Mane 6 have to recruit the help of all other Races to combat it.
<Quick_Thinker> learned it the hard way never do a self insert the FIM fic people hate those
<Sumica> 00,10ehhhhh, Cardslaugher has got it to work imo Polydunami
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: mine is going to be about a charter's interactions in Ponyville as a young forginer getting used to life in ponyville after living most of her life with her family in a unlisted town outside of Equestria's border. some of my own post-apocoliptic nonsense mixed in as a Equestria backstory... other then that this one is my frist attempt at charter/action centered instead of plot centered
<Quick_Thinker> ah
<magmablock> Reminds me a bit of Skies of Arcadia
<noname> *crack*
<magmablock> Namely the evil empire with the weapon of mass destruction, magical gemstones, etc.
<Alpha-Omega> Mine sounds to farfetched to share so I'll keep it to myself
<Quick_Thinker> mine was based entirely off the MLP roleplaying is magic CAMPAIGN BY THE AgentKalim THAT HAS NOT EVEN STARTED AND IM STARTING TO THINK HE QUIT ON US GOD DAMNIT
<Sumica> 00,10castle in the wind is alot like this too

<Sumica> 00,10wait.......is that the same VA that did shinji in the US dub of EVA
<OtakuTom> I don't think Spike Spencer did any voices in Nadia...which character are you talking about?
<Sumica> 00,10the boy
<OtakuTom> No, that's not him. I keep forgetting the name, even though it's been in the credits, but I know it's not Spike Spencer.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat Atlantis
<Quick_Thinker> has any one seen AgentKalim on since say last month
<noname> Its to bad it sank
<derpy_pony> the barbarian girl can't appreciate art anyway...what a waste of time

<ArcherJoe11> Quick_Thinker: My First ever FanFic was a Naruto/Godzilla Crossover called "Narut The Kaiju Summoner". I haven't updated in Years now and can't get any inspiration to continue.
<[SWAG]Haku> I think Ive read that ine
<[SWAG]Haku> one
<[SWAG]Haku> What happened in it?
<Quick_Thinker> well actually i remember RioGascar being quite popular everyone said i got the personalities down
<ArcherJoe11> Naruto met those Fairies and they let him sign the Kaiju Summoning Contract.
<[SWAG]Haku> oh
<[SWAG]Haku> Well, Im actually thinking about putting Godzilla in my story\
<sub06905> lol wut
<ArcherJoe11> It ends before the Chuunin Exam Arena Match.
<XAX> We're so mature.
<[SWAG]Haku> And then Naruto summons GOdzilla and is crowned Kings of kages?
<Alpha-Omega> I'm either gng to bed now or playing black ops. bye
<Quick_Thinker> heres what happened in mine pochers are in Rio and Aferica and kidnap blu jewl and the madagascar crew and well after a plane crash i kinda of ran out of ideas
<[SWAG]Haku> Cya AO
<[SWAG]Haku> I had three naruto stories going beofre I discontinued them all
<[SWAG]Haku> My first was a NAruto/Demonata cross over
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: i gave you a review. I dont have much to help you on, only basics. I dont understand what it is about so obviously im sorry that i cant help more
<ArcherJoe11> No, I planned big fights for him. Like King Gidorah. or other Aliens.
<[SWAG]Haku> I had no idea what to do after the first chapter
<[SWAG]Haku> My second was a "Naruto going to an AU" thing, where Orichimaru was actually a good guy
<Mishia> [SWAG]Haku: I also wish i could help you...im to unfamilar with it to be of help :(
<[SWAG]Haku> lol
<ArcherJoe11> [SWAG]Haku: Mine has 8 Chapters. And a small Harem for Naruto.
<[SWAG]Haku> My 3rd was by far my most popular
<[SWAG]Haku> It was a Naruto-Gaara friendship sorta thing where both met up as children
<[SWAG]Haku> I canceled it after the 4 chapter i think
<[SWAG]Haku> Then I got really into Invader Zim
<[SWAG]Haku> And I was actually able to write some prety good stuff
<ArcherJoe11> then I tried a A:TLA Naruto Cross. It wasn't that bad. Naruto: Rebirth of the Elements.
<Mishia> [SWAG]Haku: Invader Zim? oooOOOOoooo
<[SWAG]Haku> Even wrote several "IZ/Disney" crossovers
<Mishia> OH GOD
<[SWAG]Haku> well, more like "IZ/Disney songs" corssoevrs
<Mishia> [SWAG]Haku: the comdey wrights itsekf,,,
<[SWAG]Haku> It sorta does
*Quick_Thinker Hugs Mishia for the review and then punch him becuase its discontinued
<[SWAG]Haku> They were all really just songfics
<ArcherJoe11> Then I had my SW:KOTOT phase. I tried a Kotor/Clone Wars Cross. Never got past Ch.1
<[SWAG]Haku> though, where the IZ characters sang classic disney songs
*Mishia slaps Quick_Thinker :3 also im a girl.
<Quick_Thinker> they be raped
<[SWAG]Haku> Such as Tak sing "Reflection" from Mulan
<ArcherJoe11> ZimTak OTP!!!
<[SWAG]Haku> ZATR
<ArcherJoe11> ;)
<[SWAG]Haku> I ship it
<[SWAG]Haku> I am a major ZATR person
<OtakuTom> Look at that, Misha. You slapped Quick_Thinker so hard he disconnected :P
<ArcherJoe11> Then I like ZAGF
<Quick_Thinker> nope the chat derped
<[SWAG]Haku> Eh, I never like Gaz
<OtakuTom> err...Mishia*
<noname> nice job Mishia, now hes gone :(
<Mishia> lol [SWAG]Haku they hate eachothers guts. how can they be shipped??
<[SWAG]Haku> I prefered it when she wasnt in a story
<OtakuTom> WHAT?! Gaz was my favorite character!
<Quick_Thinker> so i had to refresh it can you say that again Miashia
<OtakuTom> He logged back in, noname :P
<noname> OtakuTom: yay
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: .-. im a chick. lol
<ArcherJoe11> Mishia: She was supposed to comeback as a regular Character. And the Shippers always ship.
<Quick_Thinker> apparently i got slapped so heres a rocket to the face MUAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH
<[SWAG]Haku> Mishia There are ways. People always put the two together in ways where they have to work together. Not to mention both are defects, so they dont have much other them each other
<[SWAG]Haku> One of the best ZATR stories Ive evr read is called "Kill Zim"
<Mishia> [SWAG]Haku: true...no shipping is bad if it has a good reason and buildup to them being togather
<Quick_Thinker> well Mishia i did not know you were female my appoligies
<ArcherJoe11> The Rebellion was supposed to play a larger role too. But the series was canceled.
<Mishia> Quick_Thinker: lol its fun suprising people
<Mishia> ArcherJoe11: now, all we have is the show...and his wonderful comics
<MadSurge> Mishia: Surpriiiiise! :$
<Quick_Thinker> just saying another nonon in FIM no Alicorns it really pisses them off

<Mishia> MadSurge: ZOMG! surge!

*Mishia hhuggles MadSurge
<ArcherJoe11> Sorry Mishia. I confused you for Misha. *hits self in head* My early morning on coffee.
<Mishia> MadSurge: im about to go to bed lol
<[SWAG]Haku> Put some ZATR in it to confuse the fans
<Mishia> [SWAG]Haku: your stories sound good.
<MadSurge> Mishia: goodnight then!
<Mishia> [SWAG]Haku: now i really wanna read them :$
<[SWAG]Haku> My story is not good, it is the opposite of good

<Ponies47> Ohai RAWRity
<[SWAG]Haku> yo RAWRity
<Dken2021> bonjour RAWRity
<Quick_Thinker> clerics in the back equals fighter hale and harder the wizard in the middle where he can shede some light and NEVER LET THAT DAMN THIEF OUT OF SIGHT
<[SWAG]Haku> wat?
<Ponies47> Dawwwwwww. My cat is sleeping on my lap. :3
<Dken2021> cute
<Quick_Thinker> never split the part
<OtakuTom> So, has anyone here watched Freezing yet?
<Quick_Thinker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUMCIn2swTU&feature=related *sigh* here take this video it help if you ever play D&D
<[SWAG]Haku> nope
<RAWRity> so, I decided to check out this new show called "Gravity Falls". Pretty fun little cartoon.
<RAWRity> It's by the guy who made The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack
<[SWAG]Haku> lol
<Dken2021> neat, would watch it, but I don't have cable anymore
<[SWAG]Haku> That shows was only a few eps from frinishing before it got canceled
<RAWRity> Dken2021: First couple episodes are online.
<Ponies47> My name is Pinkie Pie~
<Dken2021> sweet, will check out later
<[SWAG]Haku> Ponies47 No, your name is Ponies 47
<RAWRity> also, saw the SDCC clip of "Wander over Yonder"
<RAWRity> didn't realize until then that Lauren Faust is married to Craig McKracken.
<[SWAG]Haku> lol
<ArcherJoe11> Quick_Thinker: Don't you know, you never split the party. Clerics in the Back keep the fighters healed and hardy. The wizard in the middle, where he can shed some light and you never let the damn thief out of sight. (Wrote this from Memory.
<ArcherJoe11> )
<Dken2021> saw that, concept is a bit bare, but we'll have to see in later episodes
<Quick_Thinker> good job
<cratorkid> this brake could last a while sooo here you guys go http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA&feature=g-vrec
<[SWAG]Haku> If you ever need a wizard, use Dumbledore. Gandaulf is the worst wizard ever
<[SWAG]Haku> He never used magic, ever
<Ponies47> [SWAG]Haku: I just wanted to start a song number! :'( But that is my nickname. My real name is [This name cannot be seen because Ponies47 will never tell anypony in this chat his real name. EVER!]
<Quick_Thinker> but did you learn from that video if you play D&D you might want to learn from it YOU NEVER WANT TO SPLIT THE PARTY EVER
<RAWRity> Wander over Yonder seems like a fun idea.
<[SWAG]Haku> Ponies47 Oh, well, my bad
<RAWRity> Though I did balk for a moment at the villain being named "Lord Hater".
<[SWAG]Haku> Ponies47 ~and I am here to say~
<Quick_Thinker> yet in steam Ponies47 your name is *REDACTED* arent i right?
<Dken2021> welp, that makes 3 finla fantasy games I've beaten, only 3 more to go...
<RAWRity> I can imagine so many "Hater gone Hate" memes...

<Dken2021> fool, never underestimate a random treasure chest in the open
<killerpony7733> it's negative effects are a asthma like condition
<Ilchymis> Team Rocket Blasts off a the speed of light

<red_ony> Lil_B: Yeah...I wished you a good night after it ...Oo
<OtakuTom> So they have to use the visors to see her.
<red_ony> Lil_B: Was about 5h ago...

<Very_Silly_Filly> I've never had pumpkin seed, what's it like?

<MadSurge> Lil_B: nooo, the blue haired girl!
<MadSurge> Aww :(
<Lil_B> MadSurge I mean in one scene of MLP :P
<dalekkahn> You could always try to build a bride to test for witches
<Very_Silly_Filly> What's it taste like?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Salty?
<red_ony> what is it with Japan and the short skirts..do they have cloth shortages there?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I think you mean the spanish dub :D haven't heard the Scream from italian dub yet :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> red_ony: Welcome to anime, enjoy the stay
<Lil_B> MadSurge oh, yeah, the spanish dub it was than... sorry
<OtakuTom> No, but it makes cosplay fun from an observer's standpoint :P
<MadSurge> Deuscht language! CALL FOR VIVI
<Lil_B> deutsch? where? Did I miss it?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: it was written on the wall
<Sumica> 00,10clearly she put points in fast transformations
<OtakuTom> She caught her with fire?
<Lil_B> btw Japan appearently LOVES the german language... I have no clue why
<MadSurge> There it was!
<red_ony> Well German is a great language after all.. :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge I saw it :D
<MadSurge> Lil_B: also, Italian
<MadSurge> :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> I want her rifle
<Liokin-Bot> red_ony: Thats all you've noticed? -lol It doesnt ever strike you that they all damn near have the same voice just at different ctives they speak. Or that some are apparently born with blue hair? Or that in some shows ex. bayblade, People are dying in iraq but a kid with a fucking plastic top with a small metal ring in it can break crators in cement with that toy? And dont even get me started about soccer in anime. -lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's very nice
<Lil_B> red_ony yes, but they just use it because... "Well.. lets use the same word... in another language... so it appears like it has a deeper meaning..."
<alexxm> burn the witch
<MadSurge> Other languages are cool :D
<red_ony> someone pinged me? my chat derped..
<OtakuTom> Liokin-Bot: more like ANY sport in anime :P
<MadSurge> Unnerving animation style!
<Liokin-Bot> A witch looks a lot like a paper cut out animated...
<alexxm> intresting animation style
<Lil_B> red_ony yes, but they just use it because... "Well.. lets use the same word... in another language... so it appears like it has a deeper meaning..."
<Dark_Horst> i have no idea what i'm watching, but i like this soudtrack
<Lil_B> red_ony just to repeat my messege :)
<Liokin-Bot> OtakuTom: -lol
<red_ony> Lil_B: :)
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst yes, the soundtrack appears to be rather good
<Liokin-Bot> Weird stick thing is now cannon apparently.
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: Puella Magi Madoka Magika :D
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: gesundheit
<Chrysalis> Liokin-Bot have you never seenn "Saki"
<Chrysalis> that shows about mahjong
<Chrysalis> and is AWESOEM
<alexxm> guns always solve everything
<MadSurge> TIRO FINALE!
<Liokin-Bot> Chrysalis: The achoholic drink? Or some type of anime?
<Sumica> 00,10I have saki
<Sumica> 00,10it's awsome show
<Stuffjusthappened> What the hell is this? An anime or a cyriak video?
<Chrysalis> Sumica IKR, never before has a tile game been so amazing
<Dark_Horst> did she just kill the flying spaghetti monster and turned it's corpse into butterflies?
<Lil_B> and again... why not just say Finish? ... or the japanese ford for Finish?... WHy Finale?
<MadSurge> DED WITCH
<MadSurge> Lil_B: because italian sounds cooler! :D
<alexxm> Lil_B its cooler that way
<Sumica> 00,10"rule of cool"
<Lil_B> MadSurge "Finale"->german XD
<Dark_Horst> yeah, we dot hat
<MadSurge> But Tiro Finale roughly means "final shot"
<Lil_B> MadSurge oh Oo
<Sumica> 00,10german is often used for magic attack calls
<MadSurge> ^that too
<Very_Silly_Filly> As much as it annoys me, I'd just go American and say "Fuck him up!"
<MadSurge> Yeah, "silhouette"
<Liokin-Bot> I guess shouting out what your going to do somehow makes it substantially stronger? Either that or anime works but pokemon physics were attacks must be order out.
<Sumica> 00,10germnay is often said to be the home of magic.
<MadSurge> WUT MAD MAX O__O
<Chrysalis> Liokin-Bot of course
<Chrysalis> its DBZ style physics
<Lil_B> Sumica I never heard of that before
<Chrysalis> shouting makes attacks stronger
<Liokin-Bot> MadSurge: Serious Sam
<red_ony> "...in the magical land of GERMANY " to quote a certain youtube video
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hi everypony! :3
<Sumica> 00,10in mithos that is Lil_B
<Chrysalis> and the name of the attack being said massivly increases its power
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is this anime, I see?!
<MadSurge> Liokin-Bot: the more flashy it is, the more powerful it is :D
<alexxm> hey Spell-of-Gaming how've you been
<OtakuTom> Well, there's also the general consensus that in most fantasy worlds, you have some sort of enchantment that you have to say in order to cast a spell.
<MadSurge> Time for backstory!
<Lil_B> red_ony dikekike made the best YTP :)
<Sumica> 00,103 ways to cast
<Spell-of-Gaming> This seems familiar...
<Sumica> 00,10full spell, speed spell and no call
<Liokin-Bot> MadSurge: Obviously. I wonder if these "LITTLE GIRLS" Even fear basica man made wepaonry. A gun probably looks like a water gun to them.
<OtakuTom> True
<Chrysalis> decreasing in power
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: Puella Magi Madoka Magica!
<Spell-of-Gaming> OMG YES.
<Sumica> 00,10the dredded ep 3

<MadSurge> *dreaded
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well time for me to sleep, Goodnight everyone, thanks for the stream Sumica ~

<dshannon> oh god, it's this episode too
<MadSurge> OtakuTom: so this is where you arrived, huh?
<alexxm> so do magical eventually become witches?
<OtakuTom> I only watched episodes 1 and 2 yesterday, so this episode is new to me.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Right, as much as I'd love to stay here and enjoy the show, I must get to work with my project because my client wants soemthing from me :3
<Liokin-Bot> Very_Silly_Filly: Later bro /)

<alexxm> bye Very_Silly_Filly
<Very_Silly_Filly> I weil :)
<OtakuTom> I feel like I should wait until I get home to watch this episode on Crunchyroll...lol
<Sumica> 00,10ewwww crunch

<Sumica> 00,10they use realy bad speed subs
<BronyInstrumental> later
<MadSurge> Madoka is best Fluttershy :D
<OtakuTom> They sub it on their own. They get the episodes straight from the distributors and as far as I can tell, sub it well before the episode airs, and are then allowed to put it up for streaming an hour after the episode airs in Japan.
<Lil_B> I'm away, I'm checking out the new Game Grunts episode and I want to try out some new VSTs and samples I got :/
<Lil_B> see you later everyone
<MadSurge> :D drunk mom
<Liokin-Bot> Way to go role model mother.
<MadSurge> Bye Lil_B :(
<OtakuTom> From the little bit of her family that we've seen, I love her mother and little brother (or at least I think it's a brother)
<Liokin-Bot> Come home saused and cursing in front of your supernatural with killing daughter and your stay at home husband.
<Lil_B> don't be sad :/ I'll in the chat so people can call me when my people need me
*Spell-of-Gaming lives in a country where Japan is closeby
*Spell-of-Gaming is not sure to be happy if Japan streams

<Sumica> 00,10only those he wants to see him can see him

<Spell-of-Gaming> Kyuubey manages to be cute and creepy at the same time.
<Liokin-Bot> Cue-Beh

<Liokin-Bot> Sumica: HAAAXXX
<Spell-of-Gaming> I love how schools in anime give no fucks if a student dies.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Also in visual novels.
<alexxm> she would make tokusatsu proud
<Sumica> 00,10and that was ep 3
<dalekkahn> And now the girl is going to wish her back alive
<Liokin-Bot> Boooooo
<Derpdash> That was sad
<Derpdash> oh well
<Liokin-Bot> Not to sound like a jerk but that girl was kinda arrogant
<MadSurge> And suddendly dark ending!
<Liokin-Bot> She got cocky
<Liokin-Bot> She got beheaded.
<OtakuTom> ...I missed it...
<OtakuTom> I just got back to the computer...
<OtakuTom> sonofa
<Sumica> 00,10oh you missed it?

<dalekkahn> Yea, with the whole restraining the other magic girl she kind of had it coming
<Sumica> 00,10well in that case
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wonder if schools in anime and visual novels give fucks about the allegedly died student.
<OtakuTom> Yea. I got pulled away from the computer and missed about the 2nd half. I'll watch it later.
<Liokin-Bot> Sumica: I smell replaeeey

<OtakuTom> Well...my prediction was half-right
<dalekkahn> How is that thing a him?
<OtakuTom> I expected it to be...what's her name...the blue-haired girl.
<OtakuTom> Sayaka?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kanon is probably the first time anime made me emotional. :P
<MadSurge> Derpdash: but was it soul-crushing depressing?
<Derpdash> MadSurge: Too me it was
<Derpdash> to
<Derpdash> 8]
<Liokin-Bot> So in her transformation she gets boots?
<OtakuTom> But then at the same time, I kinda saw Mami not lasting long after learning her backstory earlier in the episode.
<Sumica> 00,10I need some happy now
<Liokin-Bot> Sumica: Call upon the sea ponys?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: Don't wory, badum, badum be happeh
<OtakuTom> Okay...so why did people say this was messed up? It's only episode 3. The viewer really should have no connection to Mami.
<MadSurge> Sumica: but it was so happy!
<MadSurge> :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> YES.

<Derpdash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3abMUH_P1E&feature=related
<MegaMoonShine> Derpdash: Vid links are frowned upon here :|
<Derpdash> oh srry MegaMoonShine :(
<Derpdash> srry everypony... :(
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Nah it's only during streams vid links are not allowed
<Michael> Derpdash: post vid links when theres no stream
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: In all curiousity how new are you here then?,
<Derpdash> just 3-4 days now
<Spell-of-Gaming> However, you can link video links during stream with the permission of the streamer. :3
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Did you read the rules and FAQ?
<killerpony7733> Just seeing if you did
<Derpdash> ......no.
<Derpdash> ill go read them now :(
<Michael> da sacred rules
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA AND LUNA do it, It's not fun to get kicked for not knowing it
<killerpony7733> It happens all to often, :(
<Spell-of-Gaming> You can't blame them though, almost nobody reads the FAQ and Rules in other sites. :I
<Spell-of-Gaming> Also the Terms of Agreement.
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah, true
<killerpony7733> Spell-of-Gaming: I will say for some it's due to laziness or just being plain stupid, Though some think since the community is friendly and all we don't have any rules or something
<Spell-of-Gaming> Though the Terms of Agreement happens more than the FAQ and Rules
<Michael> lol
<killerpony7733> Still it's common for newcomers to think not know there are actual rules and what not
<killerpony7733> Still the most facehoof inducing thing is when a regular breaks rules :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Actually, the most facehoof inducing thing is when you fail tab use. :D
<killerpony7733> Sorta, I still find the idea of a regular who knows the rules and everything just breaks the rules
<killerpony7733> stupid
<killerpony7733> We are the people who are mean't to set examples for the newcomers
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm actually pretty kind IRL, but I put things I complain about almost here. :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey ponies, I'm back
<Very_Silly_Filly> And do I always have to come back to a bloody debate?
<MegaMoonShine> Wb Very_Silly_Filly :)
<Michael> hai Very_Silly_Filly

<MegaMoonShine> Apparently yes, Very_Silly_Filly :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> I've wondered, where did you get your nickname here, Very_Silly_Filly? :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> I did go by a different name, but from personal issues, I changed it
<Very_Silly_Filly> I've been under this name for around 8 months
<Alchemist> i have no idea whats going on...
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah, it's a mystery
<Alchemist> I mean I thought TF2 was an online shooter...
<MegaMoonShine> Well it is, but it seems not many people are online on this map
<Michael> dat surf map

<sonicandmario85> three
<sonicandmario85> you can kill them faster
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Michael> i dunno
<Phase4> 00,02one is probably easier
<Phase4> 00,023 makes for much bigger rockets
<DB_Brony> TWENTY!
<Michael> lol
<Phase4> 00,021 will be easier, 3 will have mroe splosions
<sonicandmario85> can you do 2?
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, kinda, it would be the same as 3
<sonicandmario85> so are 3 kerbals too fat for it?
<Phase4> 00,02one it is
<pony_1762j> flip a coin
<Phase4> 00,02has to be a plane doesnt it
<Michael|AFK> brb
<sonicandmario85> i see a kerbal walking at the bottum
<DB_Brony> looks awfully phallic
<sonicandmario85> no wheels=disaster usally
<sonicandmario85> XD
<mario_pony> lol
<sonicandmario85> i seen sumica do it without wheels andthe whole thing exploded

<killerpony7733> And back from tribes ascend
<Phase4> 00,02parts in the same craft no longer colide with one another
<Phase4> 00,02but everythings a little more flimsy
<DB_Brony> yay no dead chat like yesterday
<Phase4> 00,02the large parts have a habbit of being powerfull enough to crush themselves
<sonicandmario85> now the rocket cant destroy itself XD
<sergio_scriptor> now that this update is here i think watching Phase playing kerbal got more 40% interesting :)
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Dat rocket
<sonicandmario85> :o
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<killerpony7733> Needs wheels
<sonicandmario85> OH NO! that cant be good for anyone
<sonicandmario85> XD
<MegaMoonShine> sergio_scriptor: That's 20% more than I expected!
<sergio_scriptor> MegaMoonShine: so it got 40% cooler ? :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> MegaMoonShine: Icwutudidthar
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm tempted to play Touhou Soccer.
<Flyboy> wait so, is this earth? or some far off planet?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dang, Sumica. :P
<sonicandmario85> This rocket needs to be bigger to get to the moon
<MegaMoonShine> Flyboy: Some far off planet
<dalekkahn> Sonic: that's not a rocket, that's a plane
<MegaMoonShine> Flyboy: Named Kerbin
<killerpony7733> Flyboy: Nope it's called kerbit or kerbin, Home of the kerbals
<sonicandmario85> spell phase4 is actually streaming
<Otherness> are those wings backwards? XD
<Phase4> 00,02this will not work
<Flyboy> MegaMoonShine: so is it possible to get to earth?
<Phase4> 00,02Otherness, there things
<Phase4> 00,02cannards
<Phase4> 00,02not wings
<killerpony7733> sonicandmario85: No sumica streamed stuff earlier that's what he is refering to
<MegaMoonShine> I dunno Flyboy :)
<red_ony> and re...it's so hot outside... almost 30 °C :O
<Spell-of-Gaming> sonicandmario85: I know. Awhile ago, Sumica streamed. :P
<Flyboy> MegaMoonShine: it would be amazing :)
<Otherness> are the things backwards? :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> red_ony: You call that hot?
<red_ony> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Yes I do...I do not like heat
<sonicandmario85> i guess sumica streamed while i wasnt awake XD
<MegaMoonShine> Flyboy: But Kerbin could be in like an entirely different galaxy or something
<Flyboy> Phase4: are those wings backwards?
<sergio_scriptor> red_ony: i live in the swiss alps so it's only 20 ºc out there :)
<Flyboy> MegaMoonShine: yeah i guess
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, nope
<Flyboy> oh kk
<MegaMoonShine> Flyboy: If so, then boy it would take a pretty long time :$
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> red_ony: tabfail
<Flyboy> MegaMoonShine: that would have to be one helluva acheivment for it
<red_ony> Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Oh..my bad :D
<sonicandmario85> i live close to tulsa and im in a country in tulsa called terlolten
<Spell-of-Gaming> red_ony: Were you going to ping me? :D
<sonicandmario85> terolten*
<Spectrum_Rush|Busy> is ok red_ony :)
<Flyboy> Phase4: congratulations! you won!
<red_ony> Spell-of-Gaming: Maybe? :(
<killerpony7733> I just live in the plain ol' denmark very close to the city,
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, : D
<MegaMoonShine> Landing gear problem?
<sonicandmario85> i live close to the woods i hope slendy doesnt sneak up on me in my house
<sonicandmario85> XD
<red_ony> Most of the buildings here, f.e. the library I just visited do not have air conditioning...too few hot days/year..but when it is hot I find it terrible.. Oo
<sergio_scriptor> i live in a town called Grindelwald in the swiss alps,i can see the eiger,jungfrau and moch mountains from my window :)
<red_ony> I can only see the rhine from my windows
<Flyboy> http://pl0x.org/wallpapers/LEEROY-JENKINS.jpg
<killerpony7733> sergio_scriptor: Closest i have been to that time of mountains is Austrich? i think,

<killerpony7733> type*
<sonicandmario85> XD
<red_ony> 5 min walk to the rhine promenade..still can't believe how lucky I've been with this flat :D
<sergio_scriptor> killerpony7733: is actualy in switzerland,but i think you might see some of them in austria :)
<Flyboy> Phase4: "hmmm... what a weird alien planet? it looks just like ours..."
<killerpony7733> sergio_scriptor: I have been on a ski trip to austrich i mean't :D
<sonicandmario85> Flyboy:all planets with life look like ours
<MegaMoonShine> This flight is going... well :S
<Flyboy> sonicandmario85: ... (facehoof)
<red_ony> Is that thing supposed to flail around like that?
<killerpony7733> And touchdown!
<sergio_scriptor> killerpony7733: cool,to be honest im afraid of skiing so instead of that i use a Schilita (sled) :$
<MegaMoonShine> Aaaaaaand...
<Flyboy> red_ony: of course it is! its a acording to the pl- (explosion)
<killerpony7733> Phase4: ok partial success! :D
<DB_Brony> We have arrived safely...
<Major> XD
<sonicandmario85> HOW DID THE KERBAL SURVIVE THAT
<Major> XD
<MegaMoonShine> Oh wow
<Flyboy> bit late for the wheels
<MegaMoonShine> HE LIVED! :O
<red_ony> the landing gear won't help now..
<DB_Brony> that was like the airplae landing
<killerpony7733> sergio_scriptor: Yeah hate it too cause i just can't figure it out, I'm overall a sled kind of guy snowmobile even
<sonicandmario85> look at all da little kerbals running around XD
<Flyboy> red_ony: only god can save you now... 'haaalaluayaaa

<sonicandmario85> well this cant end well...
<sonicandmario85> XD
<sergio_scriptor> Bronystate has 2 original shows: "the buffer show" and "the Phase4 impossible machines show" love both of them :)
<Phase4> 00,02xD
<sonicandmario85> sergio if you wanna buy the game its called kerbal space program
<Flyboy> sergio_scriptor: we interrupt your programme for more buffering!
<killerpony7733> Phase4: WAit are you making a rocket that flies to a certain altitude then detach and fly the small plane attached to it?, If so THATS GENIOUS!
<sergio_scriptor> sonicandmario85: i know that,i tried it once :)
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, well thats the attempt :3
<sonicandmario85> did the new kerbal space program add kerbals in the thing where you make the rocket?
<Phase4> 00,02i built another like this
<Phase4> 00,02should probably start with that
<sergio_scriptor> sonicandmario85: it made them hable to leave the rocket
<sonicandmario85> i whould probally pt 2 giant thruster son the wings but it probaly whouldent work anyway XD
<sonicandmario85> put*
<sergio_scriptor> what a mess :D
<sergio_scriptor> jk

<sergio_scriptor> im still waiting the kerbal update when they enable you to build UFO's :|
<Noteworthy> hey evryone
<sergio_scriptor> hi Noteworthy :)
<Dark_Horst> that'll work
<Noteworthy> oh cool did they update kerbal?
<sergio_scriptor> Noteworthy: yep :)
<MegaMoonShine> hey Noteworthy :)
<sergio_scriptor> Noteworthy: now the kerbals can leave the rocket and walk in the mun :)
<Dark_Horst> Noteworthy: 0.16
<Noteworthy> thats awesome
<Groogle> Hi, everypony
<sergio_scriptor> hi Groogle :)
<Noteworthy> hi Groogle
<sonicandmario85> HELLO!
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: working with wings works a whole lot better if you switch fron hex to circle
<MegaMoonShine> Hi, Groogle :)
<sonicandmario85> YOUR JUST IN TIME FOR DA KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM SHOW!
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, meh
<Groogle> AW YEAH
<sergio_scriptor> sonicandmario85: i think you mean "the Phase4 impossible machine show" :)
<Groogle> This is gonna be dope
<Dark_Horst> sooooo.... what are the odds it'll survive the runway?
<sonicandmario85> sergio hes actually making rockets and stuff...
<Noteworthy> lol
<Groogle> Whut?
<sergio_scriptor> Dark_Horst: i will give it 4 to 10
<Phase4> 00,02dis is not working

<Groogle> Use the friendship express
<Groogle> in space
<DB_Brony> This is like Top Gear but with rockets....now how would that title go like?
<sonicandmario85> Groogle:but it cant fly
<sergio_scriptor> sonicandmario85: i know that i said the impossible machine show,beacuse Phase4's rockets are always so crazy :)
<Ilchymis> It can be easier to just make a spaceplane on the rocket pad and steer it forward instead of up.
<killerpony7733> DB_Brony: Hah top geaR!
<Groogle> With friendship it can
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma launch this while i think
<sonicandmario85> thrusters sometimes do it...if the rockets good enough XD
<sonicandmario85> but kerbals end up dying
<sonicandmario85> when it fails
<Groogle> YES! YES
<sergio_scriptor> sonicandmario85: sometimes they survive :$
<sonicandmario85> yes that is true
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Dark_Horst> that one looks promising
<sergio_scriptor> YES,it's working :=D
<sonicandmario85> its like a space shuttle :D
<Noteworthy> its an apollo
<sergio_scriptor> this might actualy get them on orbit :P
<Flyboy> oh shit! its bending!#
<sonicandmario85> sergio_scripter:or th moon
<MegaMoonShine> Yep, this could actually work
<Groogle> Uh oh
<Ilchymis> Getting into spae and steering it so it does not get pulled back down by gravity are too different things hahaha
<sergio_scriptor> sonicandmario85: indeed
<Flyboy> bye bye kerbals
<sonicandmario85> its tilting
<sonicandmario85> oh well what chould go wrong?
<sonicandmario85> XD

<Michael> hai Derpdash
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Wb!
<OtakuTom> I'm home, dad! I'm proud of you, son. Dad, are you space? Yes, now we are a family again.
<Ilchymis> Hello Derpdash!
<DB_Brony> Hey Derpdash
<linx> too much space
<Derpdash> ty guys :)
<sergio_scriptor> hi Derpdash :)
<Derpdash> i feel lately that i found a really open armed type of community
<Kammerjunk> Ah! I know! Quick, tell me me name of the English Dragostea Din Tei PMV!
<Noteworthy> and we have liftoff again
<DB_Brony> OtakuTom: Getting bored of space...
<Derpdash> you guys mean so much to me now :P
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Got a good look on the rules and the FAQ i presume? :P
<Flyboy> Phase4: your the best at space!
<Kammerjunk> I'll try to kill it with epilepsy!
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Well we are a family
<Noteworthy> bored of space. want to go to kerbin
<DB_Brony> Flyboy: indeed he is
<sergio_scriptor> Derpdash: :) and you mean a lot to us to
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, : D
<Derpdash> killerpony7733: Yup I got em down now :)
<sonicandmario85> GO TO THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON WHERE ITS COLD
<sergio_scriptor> Flyboy: as i said once Phase4 is the best rocket flyer in all of equestria :)
<Michael> dark side of the moon is full of transformers
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Great, And always remember to follow them. Look at me never been actually kicked or banned except from the auto kick for over 6 messages in 10 seconds once.
<Derpdash> killerpony7733: k will do
<OtakuTom> I haven't even suffered from that kick, Killerpony :P
<Noteworthy> ive never been kicked
<killerpony7733> OtakuTom: I think i was a bit toooo quick for typing, Else i have had no actual kick or ban in anyway
<twilight_sprinkle> ive been kicked several times, im a seasoned criminal.
<sonicandmario85> DB_Brony:the moons actually made of molten rock in real life not cheese if it was made of cheese and it was hot on it it would melt
<MegaMoonShine> I got auto kicked once for spamming :$
<Derpdash> i do have to go in 10 minutes though :(
<Derpdash> bcuz i got band camp :/
<OtakuTom> Yea. I'm a fast typer, but I never really say anything short enough to send 6 messages in 10 seconds...lol
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: We are always around so don't worry
<sonicandmario85> the moon is made of molten rock NASA has confirmed it
<Michael> da mun
<Very_Silly_Filly> sonicandmario85: If it was molten, then why isn't it liquid?
<Derpdash> killerpony: I think I've noticed that in the past 4 days :D
<killerpony7733> OtakuTom: For me it was really just attempting, Like typing slower
<sergio_scriptor> Derpdash: we are here 24 hours a day,stream or no stream :)
<DB_Brony> Sonicandmario85: you didn't need to write all those sentences I know that the moon isn't really made of cheese it was simply a joke. :D
<OtakuTom> Yea, even if there's no stream going on, there's still people in chat (though activity in chat tends to drop when there's no stream)
<Michael> now to the earth :D
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Also common tip, Type a bit of someones name then press tab it auto completes and pings them
<sonicandmario85> Very_Silly_Filly:it was once and so was our earth
<linx> what's on friday night?
<OtakuTom> I still haven't done that, killerpony7733 (yes, even then I manually typed it out :P)
<Derpdash> killerpony7733: like this?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I know that, but most of the moon isn't molten right now
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Yes like that
<Phase4> 00,02suddenly planet
<Derpdash> killerpony7733: oh ive always typed the names out xD
<Derpdash> underscores and everything
<sergio_scriptor> linx: i will have the movies Drak Crystal and Flash Gordon :)
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: OtakuTom Generally it saves time to type with tab so i use it due to that
<killerpony7733> Which means i do not have to worry about capital letters or things
<sonicandmario85> oh my god they are getting back to kerbin successfully
<Derpdash> killerpony7733: Yeah ill say
<linx> sergio_scriptor: thanks :)
<OtakuTom> Derpdash, the problem with the tab thing is some of us have similar usernames. The best example is myself and otakon, who is not on right now, but people tend to mistakenly ping him by typing out 'otak-TAB'
<Noteworthy> playin some tom petty now for this
<Noteworthy> free fallin
<sergio_scriptor> i just loved last week friday and saturday night,the movie wore just awesome,especialy the asterix one :)
<sonicandmario85> HES MOVING TO THE OTHER SIDE
<Michael> sergio_scriptor: asterix is awesome
<killerpony7733> OtakuTom: I have a few accidental tabs but else i usually look at the name i'm auto completing and keep tabbing till i get it right
<sergio_scriptor> Michael: indeed :)
<Derpdash> oh i didnt even realize Phase was streaming till i saw the rocket scientist pony :p
<sonicandmario85> so did the stream end?
<sergio_scriptor> is it buffering for anyone else ?
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah me
<Derpdash> me too
<Michael> yes
<OtakuTom> It's buffering for me, but Phase would have said something if the stream was actually over.
<Derpdash> aww i hope it didnt end :'(
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: I know most mods/streamers by heart so no problem knowing who usually
<sergio_scriptor> welll if it's over,thanks for streaming Phase4 :)
<Noteworthy> stop bufeer time
<linx> damn buffer
<sonicandmario85> i think if it doesnt say on air its not on
<Derpdash> i usually refresh if it buffers :/
<MegaMoonShine> But, but it didn't finish!!
<Derpdash> but its not working this time
<OtakuTom> It's more likely that his streaming program stopped responding.
<linx> refresh away
<killerpony7733> Derpdash: Yet a common and smart thing to do
<killerpony7733> yep*
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, nope
<OtakuTom> Or his internet connection derped, which is why he just had to log in and ghost himself out.
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:why did you shut off the stream?
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, my brother was asked to reset the breaker
<MegaMoonShine> Will phase make a successful landing back on Kerbin? Tune in next week to find out!
<OtakuTom> ah
<Michael> lol
<Phase4> 00,02but none of them were triggered
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.

<killerpony7733> Flyboy: Others? you are not talking right, No one is allowed to anyone that does it usually haven't checked the rules or can't see the stream and think it's not on. So you are not correct
<BrOnyxia> ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼﻿

<Flyboy> killerpony7733: thanks for the mercy :)
<sergio_scriptor> ...last night i dreamed i was a time lord with my own TARDIS,and my name was "The Guardian" :\
<linx> cool
<killerpony7733> Flyboy: I'm a nice person, I just hate to see people get kicked or banned due to having a bad grasp of the rules
<killerpony7733> I try to be informative for people
<Flyboy> killerpony7733: well ima recheck the rules now, for safe measure
<killerpony7733> Flyboy: Please do,
<DB_Brony> yeah, killerpony7733 doesn't bite.....or atleast not that hard
<sonicandmario85> gummy bites but not hard
<sonicandmario85> XD

<Noteworthy> epic flip
<sonicandmario85> TO NARNIA!
<sonicandmario85> XD
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: ha ok :P
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: What we need is a feature that makes it so that anyone new HAS to read the rules and FAQ before being allowed to go on stream and chat
<DB_Brony> that never ceases to crack me up
<BrOnyxia> ;o
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: Too many nowadays just waltz in thinking they can be and do what they want
<MegaMoonShine> Woooo! :O
<Groogle> Another masterpiece from DJ Alex S.
<sonicandmario85> everypony radio?
<MegaMoonShine> \(^^\) |(^^)| (/^^)/
<sergio_scriptor> my first time on Bronystate i read the rules before entering the stream :) im a rare breed :P
<BrOnyxia> ahax
<sonicandmario85> i just found the source for this pony music
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Well, since that doesn't exist, it's our job to do it.
<AdamTheDuck> sonicandmario85: lol ikr
<twilight_sprinkle> hey Scoot-Scootaloo can i ask you something in PM?
<sonicandmario85> ITS GOOGLE TIME!
<killerpony7733> sergio_scriptor: I can't remember but i didn't at first but quickly did not long after
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03go for it
<OtakuTom> Well...I still do what I want, but I tend to only chat wherever I go, then I learn the rules as other people make mistakes...lol
<killerpony7733> Scoot-Scootaloo: Quite true, But still if such feature could be made or something it would reduce the amount of newcomers from getting themselfs banned or kicked
<Michael> later everypony, time for lunch :$
<sergio_scriptor> bye for now Michael :)
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Michael

<AdamTheDuck> sergio_scriptor: I never remember my dreams :/
<linx> i have dreamless nights
<Flyboy> Phase4: put on Rainbow Factory! :)

<sergio_scriptor> AdamTheDuck: sometimes that happens :)
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, no :<
<Flyboy> :(
<Flyboy> Phase4: what about September? or Discord?
<sergio_scriptor> i said already but,i dreamed i was a time lord named "the guradian" and i even had my own tardis,and i was fighting weeping angels :|
<AdamTheDuck> lol rainbow factory is still sitting in my desktop waiting to be read :S
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, talking to dad
<sergio_scriptor> *guardian
<Flyboy> Phase4: oh right
<linx> flyboy: living tombstone is great
<Flyboy> linx: ikr
<MadSurge> I only want that amazing comical rendition of Rainbow Factory with all the genderbent voices :D
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Oh like the RDP one?
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: I think that's the one :D
<AdamTheDuck> That reminds me, why is Rainbow Dash seen as gay all the time? I just don't understand the jokes :/
<linx> flyboy: how you get it so it notifys the person when you send a message
<linx> to them
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Yeah sweetie bell in thta has the most manly voice :D
<killerpony7733> that*
<sergio_scriptor> AdamTheDuck: beacuse she is a tomboy,and has a rainbow colored mane
<Meanwhile> AdamTheDuck: Because rainbows are a gay pride symbol.
<AdamTheDuck> Rainbows are a symbol of gay pride?
<sergio_scriptor> AdamTheDuck: yep
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: she's a jock, she's competitive and tomboyish, THEREFORE she MUST be lesbian :|
<killerpony7733> linx: Type some of their name and then tab to auto complete
<linx> Flyboy: thanks :P
<killerpony7733> linx: I'm not fly boy silly filly :D
<AdamTheDuck> Awkward moment when you like rainbows yourself...
<sergio_scriptor> i like double rainbows :P
<linx> i'm lost now
<linx> :(
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Dat stereotype,
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: Ikr -__-
<Noteworthy> ok im back
<sergio_scriptor> welcome back Noteworthy :)
<killerpony7733> linx: I was the one telling you how to type a bit of their name and then tab to auto complete to make it ping them correctly
<linx> thanks anyway :$
<killerpony7733> linx: Always there to help :)
<MadSurge> I mean, RD is my least favorite pony, but even I can't stand the "lol she's lez" jokes!
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge: Me neither :/
<linx> killerpony7733: just got lost, new here
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: to be honest i think the rainbow dash being a lesbian jokes sort of funny :)
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: I honestly favor RD due to her element, but overall i see equal in all of the mane six due to their traits and personalities
<Groogle> I don't find them funneh, i think she's not lez
<killerpony7733> linx: How new to be exact?
<red_ony> I find all sorts of things funny others don't..rd lesbian jokes included :D
<MadSurge> sergio_scriptor: only if it's really overblown :P
<linx> killerpony7733: joined today
<sergio_scriptor> MadSurge: indeed :)
<killerpony7733> linx: Ah ok read rules and FAQ yet?
<Noteworthy> i kind of have the same personality of rainbow dash when it comes to flying and all that since i dream of being in the air force one day
<linx> killerpony7733: not yet will do later tho
<sergio_scriptor> Noteworthy: good luck with that...
<Noteworthy> yeah i know thats going to take a lot
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: a fandom where all main characters are someone's favorite and none are seen as terrible? Surely you jest! :D
<killerpony7733> linx: Later is no excuse, Read them now rather then later. You need to know the rules :S
<Noteworthy> but im taking an aviation program at my school this year and ill have my pilots license by my senior year
<linx> killerpony7733: kk will do thanks
<String_Shredder> linx: and for your official initiation, you have to find Gondor
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Nope, People have preferred favorites yes, But the characters themselfs are equal, Traits and everything
<sergio_scriptor> Noteworthy: also the air force needs special fisique,like if you are to short or to tall to fit in the chair of the cockpit,you are not alowed to be there,it's like you need the perfect fisique to do it,so good luck with the grades,just good luck,and i hope you can get it :)
<OtakuTom> As long as they're not doing something stupid like posting r34 or spoilers, just chatting is fine for now. And linx left for the moment to read the rules, String_Shredder :P
<OtakuTom> And now linx is back :P
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Each one has a strength and weakness
<String_Shredder> linx: and for your official initiation, you have to find Gondor
<Noteworthy> yeah thanks i'll need it x)
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: and therefore everyone has his/her favorite
<Phase4> 00,02wat am i listening to ?
<linx> String_Shredder: i'll take you with me
<Noteworthy> even if i dont ill still have my pilots license so i can still fly

<Flyboy> RainBowJack: yeah thats the nuke cannon
<PsychoticDoc> make the baller a bit wider, looks like some sorta airsoft bullpup
<PsychoticDoc> barrel*

*WallDives is away: Stepped out.
<Wrek> 05propaganda tower ftw
<RainBowJack> indeed Wrek
<RainBowJack> Gattling tanks FTW
<twilight_sprinkle> im not very knowledgable in gun tech, but if the barrel is higher than the shoulder thing, wouldnt that make it have considerable vertical recoil?
<Chrysalis> twilight_sprinkle yes
<Chrysalis> unless it uses internal recoil suppression
<Chrysalis> which could kick it lower
<twilight_sprinkle> Chrysalis: i guess we'll just assume wreks gun uses internal recoil suppression :D
<RainBowJack> Chrysalis my Mistress
<MadSurge> Teehee guess who got a new tablet :D
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: can you give us a clue?
<Chrysalis> a) dont RP in here

*MadSurge fus ro dahs twilight_sprinkle back to Skyrim
<Ilchymis> Back to the vertical recoil question, look up the Panzerbüchse 39. It is an anti tank rifle with a barrel positioned higher than this gun here.
<twilight_sprinkle> Thrackerzod: google translate ftw

<killerpony7733> Shyfluttershy88: Show is written so well all characters should have atleast one trait or something along those lines to relate with, Oh and a easier way to respond to someone is to type a bit of their name and press tab, That auto completes it and pings
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Ninja'd :D
<Borg> MadSurge: Evil

<TheRandomkid321> killerpony7733... I ask nicely and get yelled at....
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: Then people are clearly not friendly enough at times,
<Ilchymis> That guitarist reminds me of Vladimir Putin.
<Lil_B> that guitar sound... is that Mark Knopfler?
<TheRandomkid321> killerpony7733 They get annoyed with me asking the same question despite the fact that I keep asking every 2 minutes not every 20 seconds... Anyway I do not wish to continue this conversation. it'll just end badly.
<turtlegod98> Watching this whilst watchin 100 greatest shut ups
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: End badly?, I'm not the type of person that would get annoyed by anyone. :(
<Lil_B> I know that song >.<
<MadSurge> :O I KNOW THIS
<Lil_B> MadSurge ikr ?
<TheRandomkid321> killerpony7733 Yu are obviously different than most the stream regulars I know of.

<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: As long as you don't begin to insult me or something like that i see no reason this conversation would end badly,

<Eulshy> eww country
<Shyfluttershy88> agreed^

<MadSurge> Wrek: I had to fill in the Metal myself, but my dad's got roughly your same tastes :$
<Lil_B> my dad is like a walking Rock'n'rocll Encyclopedia... he has read so manny books about band, when I ask him abound a band he will tell me where eadh member came from :/
<MadSurge> The most bizarre stuff he listens to are The Nice and Emerson Lake & Palmer
<Ilchymis> Don't suppose I'm the only one who listens to classical or choral in here?
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG likes old music
<Malavolent> Ello there, what are we listening to?

<Everlasting_Joy> I'll be right back.
<FairysHuff> Lil_B Thanks.

<Michael> dat epicness
<valoreins> 1994 i was 2 yrs old lol

<Eli> i was 1... i feel old now :(
<Kammerjunk> Pink Floyd sure knows how to do a lightshow.
<Michael> i was 3
<Fisheh_Fish> I was born
<String_Shredder> I wasn't a brony in 94
<Kammerjunk> They were in Denmark some years ago. It was cash.
<Everlasting_Joy> '94? I was 5.
<SirGanjalf> Pink Floyd concert? sweet
<Lil_B> valoreins hey, we are born in the same year Oo
<valoreins> rly? :o yay~
<StinkomanFan> Random thought, Why did they make Hostel 3 if nopony liked Hostel 2?
<PsychoticDoc> in 1994 i was -4 years old
<Kammerjunk> So Pulse, was that the Wish You Were Here album?
<Groogle> What is this? may i ask
<Fisheh_Fish> I was born in '94...
<Eli> many people around 17-25 here then ^^
<Kammerjunk> Groogle: Pink Floyd's Pulse concert.
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk: no this is shine on you crazy diamond
<SirGanjalf> '91 here
<Kammerjunk> PsychoticDoc: Which is in the Wish You Were Here album.
<Groogle> Cool, thanks
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk: but this is pulse, im looking at the tour song list right now
*Nittany_Discord 11,01shines
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I'm just curious if they're sticking to songs from one album or just doing whatever.
<Eli> 'I wish I was there' fits better
<String_Shredder> Nittany_Discord is best crazy diamond
<Lil_B> rise and shine Nittany_Discord ... rise... and smell the ashes...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*crazy laugh*
<Karaoke> Anyone wanna see what I drew?
<Bronysith> Word of advice for all. If you eat a brownie someone gives you before a pink floyd show...you are gonna have a bad time!
<PsychoticDoc> I wonder if this is gonna be the entire concert, including dark side of the moon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hell, I actually have a crazy laugh.
<Kammerjunk> You totally do.
<Karaoke> Nittany_Discord: I doo too
*Sleeping|MasterBoss is going to take a dragon nap
<Karaoke> do*
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I love your laugh, Nittany! :D
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Scoots.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish I had a capture card. I'd stream Dead Space 2 from my 360 and cackle at the deaths in the game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're actually pretty funny.
<Karaoke> wat
<Kammerjunk> ...Yeah.
<Michael> that would be funny
<Kammerjunk> I played Dead Space 2 for like, 10 minutes.
<Kammerjunk> That was on the PC.
<Karaoke> that's how long my play sessions of amnesia are
<PsychoticDoc> Nittany_Discord: funny enough, i have a capture card but i never use it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Amnesia is boring.
<Lil_B> I like this very very slow psychadelic songs
<Kammerjunk> Dead Space just wasn't as interesting to me as I'd have liked it to be.
<Kammerjunk> Dat Roger Waters.
<String_Shredder> true dat Nitt
<PsychoticDoc> shine on you crazy diamond.....
<Lil_B> not like... I love thm I loose myself into them
<Karaoke> Nittany_Discord: only the beginning. It's the kind of scares that build up and immerse you
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi Nittany_Discord
<Kammerjunk> Roger Waters is the only one of the band still alive, right?
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk: yes and he just finished his wall live tour
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk: i was at one of them too
<Kammerjunk> I was at the live show in Denmark some years ago.
<Kammerjunk> It was fun.
<Lil_B> most People of Pink Floyd are dead?
<PsychoticDoc> almost all of them
<String_Shredder> FUN FACT: during the mixing of this song, Syd Barrett, the former frontman of Pink Floyd and the guy this song was made for walked in on the sessions and listened.
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Pink Floyd started in 1965.
<PsychoticDoc> i think gilmour is still kicking
<Karaoke> Anyone wanna see what I drew? It's clean.
<PsychoticDoc> not in particular
<Karaoke> It's a sketch of my OC
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, Gilmour isn't dead yet.
<Lil_B> Kammerjunk oh,. I didn't know that Oo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One of the most entertaining deaths in the first Dead Space was getting your head lopped off by a necromorph that then inserts itself into your neck and takes your body over.
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm getting sick of this buffering, and I know where it's coming from.
<Lil_B> Dat Sax-Switch
<Kammerjunk> PsychoticDoc: Oh. Mason isn't dead yet either.
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk: huh, i thought he was
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, me too.
<String_Shredder> Gilmour's still alive, isn't he?
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<PsychoticDoc> strange how the broke up, roger is still doing great with the current band of his though
<valoreins> this song, is how old?
<PsychoticDoc> very
<valoreins> i think we really need songs like this in today's generation
<Michael> it's from 1975
<PsychoticDoc> Brony state needs more pink floyd, this is like the only time i have ever heaard it played here
<Kammerjunk> Oh? I've seen Wrek stream it once before.
<PsychoticDoc> i always have to listen to my zune for pink floyd
<PsychoticDoc> its like barren of psychedelic music
<X3Egg> Is this the 1994 one?
<PsychoticDoc> oh my god yes
<String_Shredder> PsychoticDot: haha, zune
<PsychoticDoc> String_Shredder: itunes sucks and its better that windows media player
<PsychoticDoc> than*
<String_Shredder> I use Pandora
<PsychoticDoc> pandoora? pffffffft
<String_Shredder> the ads are annoying, but I get over it
<Michael> get adblock
<Kammerjunk> >Not using an ad blocker
<Kammerjunk> Hell, I use at least two.
<PsychoticDoc> i use adblock and have been for a long time
<String_Shredder> Michael: You can't use ad blocker with Pandora as far as I know
<Platypus-Man> "<@Wrek> Platypus-Man: no youtube links durign streams" oh, ok... how can I see if a stream is going on btw, didn't see anything in the channel topic?
<Michael> i dunno, never used it
<Kammerjunk> How new is Pandora?
<String_Shredder> Kammerjunk: I don't know. I haven't used it in a while
<iGoSam> this is so gay.......
<Kammerjunk> Bleh, I'm just going to use Firefox anyway, because I haven't got any change.
<PsychoticDoc> iGoSam: GTFO
<iGoSam> >P
<Kammerjunk> Also, INB4 boot.
<WraithHoof> Hi
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 kick
<Kammerjunk> He left.
<PsychoticDoc> thank god
<Groogle> Hey Wraithhoof
<Wrek> 05Platypus-Man: its not shown in the channel topic. its shown on the site
<Michael> hai Wraithhoof
<valoreins> using gay as insult... how is he?
<valoreins> how old is he*.
<Platypus-Man> oh, ok
<Michael> hater minds in a nutshell
<AttacktheAndalite> valoreins: Probably 11 or 12
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The division Discord
<Everlasting_Joy> Michael: And look how far it gets them.
<Kammerjunk> >2012
<Kammerjunk> >Trolling bronies
<PsychoticDoc> People need to be thankful for roots, not todays crap
<Michael> yeah, thinking that gay is an insult
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Many people still hate bronies Kammerjunk.
<PsychoticDoc> Nittany_Discord: they usually put up a better fight though
<Kammerjunk> I know, but getting mad over a troll is contradictory if one follows at least the "tolerate" thing.
<valoreins> i know most middle schooler does
<Kammerjunk> Sticks and stones and everything.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kids are cruel.
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I need to take off folks. Hope to be back on sooner then later!
<Kammerjunk> Valedico, Everlasting_Joy!
<BronyInstrumental> Nittany_Discord: you think i'm cruel? :'(
<Michael> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BronyInstrumental: No.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lemme rephrase that.
<BronyInstrumental> ik i was just testing :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some kids are cruel.
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye, Everlasting_Joy
<CriticKitten> Silly fillies.
<PsychoticDoc> Middle schools, youll never find a larger hive of villany and evil
<CriticKitten> When the troll comes in, you *ignore* him.
<CriticKitten> Never feed a troll.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01PsychoticDoc: Agreed.
<valoreins> reminds me of a brony friend on fb, middle schooler and most of his classmates ridicule him because of being a brony
<Kammerjunk> Aww, but I like having a troll pet.
<Kammerjunk> They're so cuddly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The worst years of my life were my middle school years.
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maximum bullying.
<valoreins> ^
<BronyInstrumental> PsychoticDoc: as much as i hate to say it, you're right
<Michael> CriticKitten: that's the best way to kill a troll
<Kammerjunk> iGoSam: Seriously, what are you even doing?
<PsychoticDoc> my middle school life was full of "fuck offs" and "shut the hell ups"
<Kandarihu> I was bullied during my middle school years and my high school years.
<PsychoticDoc> thank god high school is gonna be the exact same :D
<String_Shredder> PsychoticDot: Sounds normal by todays standards
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fun fact: I'm not a socially-confident person.
<AttacktheAndalite> Why do you say that, PsychoticDoc
<Kammerjunk> My middle school life was full of nothing, basically. Well, there were books. God, I love books.
<Kandarihu> Neither am I.
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: Me neither. As in, if someone hugs me, I go blank. I have no idea what to do.
<BronyInstrumental> iGoSam: to come to a website based upon people to put them down seems kinda contravercial, seeing as you're the minority in that situation
<FlutterShyblackops1> hey
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My family hates the fact that I stay at home a lot.
<PsychoticDoc> AttacktheAndalite: racists, ignorants, and jackasses are all youll find in todays generations
<valoreins> and thank god college no one gives a flying feather about me being a brony, i even made some of my friends to watch mlp and they like it
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, why is hugging so uncomfortable?
<PsychoticDoc> me? im just a sarcastic idiot
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I know what to do when I get hugged.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm just a Fluttershy.
<Kammerjunk> I have no clue.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or a Twilight.
<String_Shredder> same here PsychoticDot
*Michael has got a hard infancy
<valoreins> then i wanna hug you nitt D:
<red_ony> Nittany_Discord: You could move out. :)
<FlutterShyblackops1> hi
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk: i never get hugged enough to find it "uncomfrtable"
<red_ony> also re :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01red_ony: I have no job.
<Kandarihu> Because of my learning problems, I spent most of my school days in Special Education. Most of my classmates were classified as EC (Emotional Conflict). In short, pretty much all of my classmates in high school were bullies.
<Michael> hai FlutterShyblackops1
<FlutterShyblackops1> :[
<EggWhite> I stay at home all the time, the only time I go out is to go to school
<Kammerjunk> PsychoticDoc: That's not my problem. My problem is that it's a social action.
<red_ony> Nittany_Discord: Oh...than maybe that first and then move. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would have stayed in PA if I had money.
<Kandarihu> The rules said that there were supposed to be two teachers in the Special Ed room at all times. Oftentimes, there was only one. And other times, I'd be alone with those guys.
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk im not social, i am anti social, in total i have 4 friends and they have been my friends for years
<MadSurge> Hey guys, I'm back! :$
<valoreins> ohai MadSurge
<Kandarihu> Hi, MadSurge.
<PsychoticDoc> MadSurge: join the retelling of highschool pain
<Michael> hai MadSurge
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey MaidSurge.
<BronyInstrumental> i feel kinda bad sometimes, cuz i wanna work and have tried to get a job in the past, but puffed up business managers wouldn't employ me for 'legal' reasons
<BronyInstrumental> hai MadSurge
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Resaluta. We're talking about how middle school life totally sucked.
<red_ony> BronyInstrumental: What reasons might that be?
<PsychoticDoc> BronyInstrumental: that sucks, im not even old enough to get the job i want
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm glad there's a campaign against bullying nowadays.
<BronyInstrumental> red_ony: child labour :(
<red_ony> BronyInstrumental: Oh :)
<valoreins> strange thing is i'm anti social throughout high school, but suddenly because ponies i learn to talk to people about it until now
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: you mean junior high?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When I was growing up, it was the victim's job to deal with it.
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: I have no idea. You people have weird education systems.
<BronyInstrumental> Nittany_Discord: you think it's changed?
<PsychoticDoc> Nittany_Discord: the campaigns do nothing to help, its not bullies, its intelligence of people today, i have never met a bully
<Kandarihu> I hope you're not thinking of that thing that Michael Savage is doing.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: the one after elementary school?
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: I don
<BronyInstrumental> PsychoticDoc: you lucky son of a *****
<PsychoticDoc> ive only met idiots who dont understand the times to talk and be happy or the times to insult and be an ass
<PsychoticDoc> BronyInstrumental: wasnt finished
<BronyInstrumental> sorry :)
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Tell me about it, My principal actually accused me of being the bully at one point due to racism,
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: I don't know! D: Over here, you go to one school for 10 years, then you're free to do whatever you want. Preferably go to another school for 3 years.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I see campaigns to stop bullying instead of telling victims how to deal with it.
<Kandarihu> Alright. Cool.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And all that led to was kids killing themselves and others because they were so sick of being bullied.
<BronyInstrumental> Nittany_Discord: it just made it happen more, it seems to me. only it goes even further un-noticed
<PsychoticDoc> I like to think that idiots of my gen have made me even less social than i normally am
<Michael> the only you can do sometimes is resist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BronyInstrumental: Anti-bullying campaigns are worsening the problem?
<Michael> because teachers don't care for u
<BronyInstrumental> Nittany_Discord: more than you'd expect
<PsychoticDoc> to be honest, im clinicly depressed and havve a lot of problems controlling the way i react to people
<BronyInstrumental> Michael: precisely. teachers give no shits
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: my bullies were mild jerks that grew out of it during high school. After that it was a "fuck you, fuck you too :D" friendship
<Metronome> Irrelevant, What are we watching?
<Kammerjunk> PsychoticDoc: I don't. That's how I deal with it.
<Kammerjunk> PsychoticDoc: React, that is.
<Michael> Metronome: pink floyd
<Metronome> ok
<MadSurge> Pink Floyd <3
<PsychoticDoc> Kammerjunk: Its my learned nature to be a sarcastic prick, than usually continue what im doing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BronyInstrumental: I guess punish the bullies?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That was my solution.
<MadSurge> ^
<Michael> ^^
<BronyInstrumental> Nittany_Discord: that option's blurred out for me too. teachers give no shits, and i'm a pacifist
<Kandarihu> I think a lot of trouble with anti-bullying campaigns is that political correctism can badly skew the definition of bullying.
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: Did you carve a little face into the wall next to their bed every night until the entire wall was covered in little faces?
<PsychoticDoc> Nittany_Discord: Punish them? makes them even more volitile, makes them blame you from the issues and make more bullies go after you
<MadSurge> Or at least put them in the bullied's shoes to make them desist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kammerjunk: No.
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MadSurge: Not a bad idea.
<Zanon> This calls for waffles.
<PsychoticDoc> i would make some ham sandwiches but this concert is cool
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let them go through the pain of having zero friends and constant social rejection.
<CriticKitten> Ah, see, I just socked my bullies and they left me alone. And the school didn't have the balls to punish me very hard because my parents were quick to point out that it was their failure to deal with their bullying problems that led to this.
<Kandarihu> If a Christian just speaks publicly supporting the Biblical definition of marriage, with no anger or hatred in his voice, that's regarded as bullying. When the Christian then gets streams of hate and vitriol and death threats and every concievable expression of hatred, it's somehow not considered bullying at all.
<PsychoticDoc> Nittany_Discord: how you that work, how can you make them even start to feel that
<CriticKitten> One of 'em was a big enough kid that my fist didn't even hurt after drilling him in the stomach, either. You bet he never messed with me again, or anyone else for that matter. :3
<BronyInstrumental> why are we even talking about this?
<Kammerjunk> Because this is BronyState.
<BronyInstrumental> chat derped. refreshing. brb
<Kammerjunk> We just talk.
<red_ony> because bronies are nerds..:/
<PsychoticDoc> All i can say is, im a sarcastic prick, everybody my age is an asshat, and i got 1 hung from not family my entire life, and i havent seen that person in more than3 months
<MadSurge> CriticKitten: a giant chicken, then?
*CriticKitten kicks Kammerjunk into a bottomless pit, to finish fulfillment of the reference.
<PsychoticDoc> hug*
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
<CriticKitten> :3
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: I pretty much had most of the zero friends and constant social rejection, I more or less played games to escape it all as a kid
<CriticKitten> Kittyfaec. :3
<Kandarihu> One time in High School, some kids on my bus stole my backpack and while they had it, they took some of my stuff out. It was later found stashed over a doorframe and some of my stuff was gone. I asked the school to try and find it and they literally told me that they're not allowed to "legislate morality".
<Michael> me too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01killerpony7733: Same.
<Metronome> ^True
<Kammerjunk> Meh. In my school, we could sit indoors in the breaks. So I just sat. And I read.
<Kammerjunk> God, I love books.
<PsychoticDoc> killerpony7733: i know that feel, just replace games with internet
<BronyInstrumental> wow. you guys had a lot of different ways to deal with the problems
<CriticKitten> MadSurge: Most bullies are. The only ones who aren't are usually part of gangs, and those kids can't really be dealt with.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Of course, I became a bitter person for a few years.
<Sumica> 00,10man you are all depresing this morning
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Where I hated everyone.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Sumica.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry Sumica :<
<BronyInstrumental> i dealt with it using music
<MadSurge> :D Sumica
<BronyInstrumental> hai Sumica
<EggWhite> killerpony7733: Same, but now I has ponies aswell!
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Am not! I'm encouraging people to beat the shit out of their bullies. D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll stop.
<Michael> hai Sumica :)
<Sumica> 00,10you dont have to stop nitt
<PsychoticDoc> music, internet,games, and sarcasim are my releases of stress and anger
<BronyInstrumental> i have an entire folder of songs i just sorta.....wrote as they came to me. maybe i'll release them one day, idfk
<Michael> interesting discussion is good
<valoreins> yesh
<Sumica> 00,10just you know just point out the things you all know
<PsychoticDoc> pink floyd helps all my, if not most peoples, problems
<Kammerjunk> BronyInstrumental: I have a bunch of short stories I wrote because I was bored organised into genre, length and the alphabet, in that order.
<Michael> music helps me relax
<MegaMoonShine> Hi everypo- ooh wrek and awesome music! :O
<Michael> hai MegaMoonShine
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: I have that kind of order only with collectable cards :D
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, I still have a bunch of Magic cards.
<Dark_Horst> wrek's pink floyd concert?
<Kammerjunk> I have never used them.
<Kandarihu> I can't honestly say I hated everyone. I guess video games and TV was my escape from all of my pressures. Then that whole murder simulator controversy started brewing. And it was so widespread back then, that I felt like everyone who I didn't know for sure was against censoring games for violence must've been for it.
<PsychoticDoc> screw it imma make some ham sandwices
<MegaMoonShine> Laz0rs!
<Dark_Horst> lasurs
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: People get upset for the strangest things. Like when you slapped that ass in Duke Nukem: Forever.
<Michael> dem lazors
<valoreins> pew pew
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: I just have these Kid Icarus Uprising cards, it's more like interactive stickers :D
<PsychoticDoc> Kandarihu: please, video games for a while made it worse for me becasue before my parents divorced my dad yelled at me for being lazy with games
<MegaMoonShine> Destroy them with lazers!
<MegaMoonShine> Pewpewpewwubwubwubwubwub
<Kandarihu> PsychoticDoc, sorry. Didn't mean to strike a nerve.
<Kammerjunk> Michael: Yup. Pink Floyd knows how to do a light show. Looked great when I was at a concert they had.
<BronyInstrumental> and then an epileptic fit
<PsychoticDoc> get your wubs out of this chat
<Kammerjunk> This is a chat for REAL music.
<Kandarihu> It's clearly a sore spot with a lot of people around here.
<MegaMoonShine> I know, I know
<Hrafn> I find it funny that video games are blamed for violence when sports aren't, at least not nearly to the same extent, I mean, I have yet to see video games cause city-wide riots :P
<Michael> we want the classic pig from waters!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: I just don't want to depress others by complaining. I'll remind myself of my grandmother's friends that did nothing but complain and put me into depression.
<MegaMoonShine> But there's a song titled destroy them with lazers :$
<Kandarihu> Hrafn, that applies to the current controversy, time wasting, too.
<valoreins> anypony here playing the open beta of phantasy star online 2?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Point the lasers at the crowd!
<MegaMoonShine> Which has wubs :P
<GarrettBrony> what is this
<Hrafn> time spent having fun is never wasted time :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's so awesome...and now I can't see!
<Kandarihu> "Look at these kids, wasting their time away getting zero social interaction or exercise with their video games"
<ekips> those laz0rz
<BronyInstrumental> Hrafn: if kids were influenced by video games then in the 70's all people would have done is roll around and eat ghosts and fruit
<Kammerjunk> >Online games
<Michael> epic lazors
<MegaMoonShine> Dude...
<red_ony> Well...I don't thing games should be cut if they're sold to adults...but otherwise..
<Hrafn> BronyInstrumental: lol :P
<valoreins> lol at BronyInstrumental 's comment
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: my grandma was a grumpy loner lady, but it seems my birth helped her being a little more softer :)
<GarrettBrony> what is this
<Kandarihu> "Alright! I got my beer and my chips, and I'm ready to spend a solid 4 hours (or however long) watching a Football game"!
<Kammerjunk> BronyInstrumental: I want to see that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My grandmother has borderline personality disorder. Look it up.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And be glad you're not living with someone with BPD.
<twilight_sprinkle> One of my grandmothers was literally insane by the time i was old enough to understand
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: who? (sorry to hear that)
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord the Brony version of that is Pinkamena Syndrome
<red_ony> I worked in a psychiatry instead of doing military duty...borderliners were the most annoying patiens I had...(no offence)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Two people in my family have BPD.
<GarrettBrony> I have aspurgurs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It makes them self-centric brats.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Worse off, they don't even know they have it.
<Kandarihu> Apparently it's unhealthy for teenagers to be spending hour upon hour of their free time grinding in an MMO, but it's totally healthy to sit around for hours and hours on end watching a bunch of people bounce a ball across a court or carry a handegg over a field of astroturf
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well, it deosnt screw with your eyes
<GarrettBrony> red_ony you were in the military?
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: bpd?
<Michael> ^ seems legit
<red_ony> noo instead of military duty
<Wrek> 05you guys enjoyign the show? :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Borderline Personality Disorder.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek: Yes.
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: yep
<valoreins> yesh
<Michael> Wrek: og course !
<Metronome> Kinda
<MegaMoonShine> Wrek: I love it! :O
<BronyInstrumental> Wrek: hell ja
<Michael> *of
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: what does that do?
<Flyboy> Wrek: well i'm not that keen on this kind iof music but i LURV lasers
<GarrettBrony> yes Wrek But I dont know who it is playing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it's not Pinkamena disorder.
<GarrettBrony> sorry
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's more bipolar.
<GarrettBrony> ya you are right
<red_ony> GarrettBrony: Back then military service was compulsury if you didn't chose to work for a social institution for the same time..I chose a psychiatry
<valoreins> you know, i may be have a bipolar syndrome
<PsychoticDoc> man, these ham sadwiches just made this conversation a lot less depressing
<Michael> GarrettBrony: pink floyd
<Lil_B> Kandarihu I will never understand how people can argue that Sitting in front of the PC all day is unhealthy without ever bringing up the people who do even less by sitting infront of the TV all day
<Ryunosuke> o/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gaming actually works your brain.
<red_ony> Lil_B: Well both isn't going to do you any good...
<BronyInstrumental> Nittany_Discord: some games don't
<Kandarihu> Anyway, I was kind in the middle of watching Macross II (feeling like trolling my mom with it, maybe I'm not sure anymore). I'm kind of wanting to get back to it.
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord unless its farmville
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Yep, It's the reason i got good reflexes
<valoreins> farmville makes you a farmer!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even CoD works you out.
<valoreins> yes FPS does have benefits
<Hrafn> of course, sitting still all day is unhealthy, but doing just about anything on a computer is far more mentally stimulating than watching tv
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You develop a skill from dealing with 12-year-olds.
<Lil_B> red_ony yes, but it still baffles me that sitting in front of the TV all day is somehom more socially acceptable...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I kid.
<BronyInstrumental> yeah. if kids were influenced by video games 90% of facebook users would be farmers by now :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You do develop reflexes and whatnot.
<PsychoticDoc> COD helps with making your hands clentch in rage, build a better grip
<red_ony> Lil_B: Für Hartz4ler vll :P
<Hrafn> hell, spending too much time online is what taught me English :P
<TrixieMuffins> the mind derps in mysterious ways
<valoreins> BronyInstrumental: or a mafia
<twilight_sprinkle> Hrafn: TV is wht taught me english
<GarrettBrony> I dont sit in front of the TV anymore. Since I dont have the Hub Bronystate and the Interent have replaces Tv for me fully
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You die too fast in CoD to develop strategy when attacked.
<Kandarihu> You develop cognitave functions relivant to the game genre you're playing. I wish the Brain Training genre wasn't so short-lived, though
<Hrafn> twilight_sprinkle: same with me, actually, at least at first, but then I started spending more time on the computer than watching tv
<Lil_B> Hrafn me too (and 80% of all other germans I know who are good at understanding english)
<BronyInstrumental> i haven't watched TV in years
<Dark_Horst> soooooo... who in here is marked?
<red_ony> getting outsite and joing an engish course would probably have taught you faster :D
<PsychoticDoc> Cod is probably the worst military game in existance, if you want army, play arma or arma 2
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: Yep, If you ever played tribes ascend you will learn alot of weight/momentum/speed related skills on how enviroment works etc
<Michael> or BF3
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst marked?
<GarrettBrony> killerpony7733 same with portal
<Michael> but if you want teamplay go TF2
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: marked http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/1106/the-mark-gamer-demotivational-posters-1306969931.jpg
<Kandarihu> Tribes Ascend is hard, though.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Valve games are good for teamplay.
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Hard yes, Fun once you begin to get the hang of it? YES
<red_ony> you guys convinced me
<Hrafn> red_ony: actually, English classes are mandatory here from grade 4 and up, but I still learned more from the tv and internet than I ever did at school :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You cannot lone wolf TF2 or L4D2 unless you are very skilled.
<red_ony> I'm going to get my ass outsite now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And/or lucky.
<GarrettBrony> Hrafn same here
<red_ony> *s
<red_ony> -d
<Kandarihu> If you're interested in rewiring your brain, just play a game that you're not good at, and NEVER PUT IT DOWN until you're good at it.
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Oh god i have that too
<PsychoticDoc> for me, the most entertaining team based game that is also a sim and a fps is Amra 2 Co\O
<PsychoticDoc> CO
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Though mine is on my left arm not right
<Michael> unless you are spy :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I bought Arma 2 for Day Z.
<Michael> but spies are easy to kill
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst its strange... IÄ, sitting on my PC from mornign to dawn for the last 3 weeks now and I don't have that mark...
<Kandarihu> Problem is, I'm having more problems with the shooting and the quick aiming in Tribes Ascend. I'm finding it easier to get used to skiing than actually shooting.
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: just tiny traces of it for me. even though i game a lot. i wonder if that is a sign that my mouse sensitivity is too high. i barely move my hand
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spy is hard to play in TF2.
<PsychoticDoc> Nittany_Discord: thats the only reason its famous, i bought it a year before Dayz
<Michael> but is so fun
<BronyInstrumental> Kandarihu: try playing skyrim with reversed controls
<Shutterfly> Hey, all. What goes on?
<Lil_B> hi Shutterfly
<PsychoticDoc> sex
<GarrettBrony> Shutterfly Pink Floyd concert
<Michael> hai Shutterfly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spies are annoying to die to as well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Damn backstabs.
<Shutterfly> Meh, Pink Floyd...
<Michael> specially with dead ringer
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: I learned both to a point, It's always a risk when predicting where this person will go etc
<red_ony> Well...I'll be afk for a while now ...GOING OUTSIDE :P
*String_Shredder backstabs Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Snipers are annoying to die to as well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In any game.
<iGoSam> not really
<PsychoticDoc> pffft outside is for no lifers
<Hrafn> outside? that place still exists?
<red_ony> see you to see movies at the latest
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord yah Spies just love to pull a Julius Caeser on the other players
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: I'm good at correcting MIRV mortar shots
<Kandarihu> I'm using a Wacom Tablet with the mouse accessory. It works just like a mouse, except the tablet decides what's up instead of the mouse.
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: they are HELL in arma (or dayz)
<red_ony> PsychoticDoc: I thought this place was? :P *ducks*
<Flyboy> Nittany_Discord: i think spies and snipers pretty much sum up my playstyle in most games :D
<Kandarihu> MIRV launcher is one of the few weapons I can somewhat reliably score kills with.
<Shutterfly> GarrettBrony: That's all they're good at
<Michael> i love demoman now :D
<GarrettBrony> et tu Spy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My aim is shit, so I don't play sniper.
<Hrafn> lately, I've usually been playing as sniper :3
<PsychoticDoc> red_ony: nah, my life is pretty much internet required, so real life is for poeple with out a life
<GarrettBrony> Michael I think Demoman might be a brony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless there are bots.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bots are easy to hit.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hehe
<Michael> GarrettBrony: lol
<red_ony> PsychoticDoc: :)
<AttacktheAndalite> Dear Celestia, I think I'm having deja vu AGAIN
<Hrafn> I haven't been playing TF2 for very long, so I'm not that great at it with any class, but I like the sniper
<Michael> and pyros are a pain of ***
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord But I love Bots. They are so good at making Snark comments at bad movies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol GarrettBrony
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> pyros arent that bad Michael
<Shutterfly> My favorite class is probably the Engineer
<Michael> i hate pyros
<GarrettBrony> Michael I think the Pyro might also be a brony
<PsychoticDoc> pyros are jerks
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Though to be fair juggs are easy ish to play as when dealing in tight and enclosed areas,
<PsychoticDoc> brony or no brony
<Metronome> WOOHOO DRawfriends
<Michael> GarrettBrony: yeah, but all the damn day spychecking
<Shutterfly> Of course Pyro is a brony, you saw what he sees, right?
<Lil_B> red_ony I would like to go outside more... there is nothing interesting -.- no people to talk to and no courses or Clps that are interesting for me :/ maybe I will have more luck when I move into a bigger city and start go into a Universaty :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That guy is eating the mic.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01::p
<Michael> lol
<Metronome> LOL
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Though predicting where the mortar shots go is a bit finicky, Else juggs are really fun
<PsychoticDoc> lawl
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My family won't stop bugging my about going outside.
<BronyInstrumental> nomnomnom mic
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord om nomnomnom
<MegaMoonShine> WOOWOOWOOWOOOOO!
*Michael noms the mic
<valoreins> oh my... dat mic must be tasty ice pop or something.
<PsychoticDoc> when my mom tells me to go outside, i just say, " and what play in the street?"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's good every one in a while, but I don't like going out because I'm not social, so I don't have anything to do.
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord: I know the feel, Family constantly says going outside fixes everything, It's funny they don't realise i have almost no friends to go out with and everything
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My mom is very social, so she doesn't understand my point of view.
<PsychoticDoc> same as me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01killerpony7733: Yeah.
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, same as me
<BronyInstrumental> my mum never tells me to go outside, we live in tha hood :D
<Shutterfly> My gf has made me go outside alot more than I usually do. Its not bad but the sun is horrible where I live -__-
<valoreins> i dont like going out, but since i met brony friends in my place i gather with them on some occasion... :)
<Hrafn> eww, sunlight :P
<PsychoticDoc> i live in louisiana, its too humid to go outside
<Michael> i only go outside for buy something or go to one cinema
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I did some things with my brony friends at Penn State. That was it.
<Hrafn> my reaction to sunlight is very much like that of a vampire
<Kandarihu> It's amazing how the internet brings together people who have no social skills.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I kow.
<PsychoticDoc> inoright
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*know
<MegaMoonShine> Yeah, it's great
<PsychoticDoc> OO OO OO ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL
<BronyInstrumental> i live in bristol, the antisocial hub of racism and discrimination in england
<Michael> dat song
<Shutterfly> Ughhhh this song is just played too damn much on the radios
<Michael> is epic
<valoreins> we are actually socializing right now right?
<PsychoticDoc> pfft
<AttacktheAndalite> I only hang with friends every blue moon. Two of them live about an hour and a half away from school and the one that lives 10 minutes from me is antisocial
<Shutterfly> valoreins: good call
<PsychoticDoc> this song is too awesome to be listend to much
<Kandarihu> Back to Macross with me. I might get kicked off this computer any time. So if I log on with the "Buddy Bear" Nick extension, that's me. And this nick is my mom.
<RaveBrony> I moved... so i dont have many local friends :'(
<Lil_B> I have good lighting in my room thanks to 2 big windows... but always with the curtains closed so I can see the screen more clearly :P
<Kandarihu> Er, Macross II. Not Macross
<Shutterfly> brb, guys. walking le dog
<PsychoticDoc> Wrek: can we watch The Wall after this or later?
<Hrafn> Lil_B: I also have my windows covered most of the time, plus I coated them with tinted film, the kind you put on car windows to make them dark :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Hrafn: what did you coat it with?
<twilight_sprinkle> Hrafn: just some spray thing?
<Hrafn> nah, it's more like a plastic film that you put on the glass
<twilight_sprinkle> Hrafn: where did you get it?
<Hrafn> hardware store
<Lil_B> Hrafn thats extreme Oo (well, I don't really have curtains, I have a Jalosie (or however you spell that) which is always just a tiny crack open XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Hrafn: cool, i need some of that, by room is too bright in the mornings
<Hrafn> they might have it somewhere that sells car accessories
<twilight_sprinkle> Hrafn: k
<PsychoticDoc> my head faces the direction the sun rises from, and i have a window near the head of my bed, and my blinds are crappy
<Lil_B> funny would be to use that foil from the glasses they use for Sun-Eclipses. You have no light, but you know where the sun is :3
<AttacktheAndalite> I have my curtains over my window overlapping each other so it's darker in the morning
<PsychoticDoc> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> one of my windows is half circular and it has no curtains which is annoying
<Hrafn> aww
<Thrackerzod> hello everyone
<Hrafn> hi Thrackerzod
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Thrackerzod
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: same with me and my parents who want me to go to the beach, where I just get bored and can't do anything but sleep and do jigsaws

<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: a trip in the ocean is fine, I just don't like dicking around the beach :D
<Flyboy> i feel sorry for any epileptics in the audience
<Hrafn> I don't like beaches that much, the sand gets kinda annoying after a while :P
<AttacktheAndalite> There's no beach where I live.
<Flyboy> i like beaches as long as they have lots of rocks to climb on
<MadSurge> Lil_B: well, now I do my bycicle sessions to be less chubby :D
<Om> Spanish Inquisition.
<Michael> wat
<MadSurge> One of these days I'm gonna cut you into pieces!
<Lil_B> MadSurge I'm going swimming every weekend for an hour to not loose all of my muscle-mass (which ain't much)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I just don't like swimming in the ocean, it's too murky
<Twilight_sprinkle> I hate the beach. Sand is coarse and gets everywhere..
*Michael wishes learn to surf
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I should start going back swimming too, it's the only "sport" I'm good at :D

<Shutterfly> AJTheMightyGamer: okay, so the elevation wont be as bad as it was for me. I live in PA so it was difficult getting used to the elevation/oxygen. But if this hasn't been shoved down your throat enough, have at least 2 Nalgene types of bottles filled each day.
