<Light_Latias> 12+$9 shipping :P
<Jenemmy2> PINKIE PIE HAS ACTUALLY LOST ALL OF HER ENERGY
<Razyn> I've been here since 11:58. My will, it only strengthens.
<Lambda> there's luna, celestia, spike, and spitfire
<Dman> This mindset however should be questioned very soon, thus leading me to obtain said companionship in relation with supernatural power that cannot be explained by ordinary science ways.
<a041744> PONIES ROCK!!!!!!!!!
<Flutter1> Sharing
<Lambda> there is a spike
<mib_vykgbu> RARITY IS THE BEST PONY
<Dman> Said companionship included countless dangerously inspired events of a very broad and risky manner that should not be imitated for security reasons. Furthermore and luckily, an enormous amount of quite amusing and entertaining activities happened to come along with my dearest aforementioned companions.
<Jenemmy2> AN AMAZING FEAT
<Arcanine> 12lol
<Trib> gummy is a pimp in every episode hes in
<Lambda> but I let her have it
<Dman> Also worth mentioning in such a context is the blood pumping organ which is able to process a considerable large amount of blood cells in a utterly and downright very short span of time. Along with these characterics come specific physical skills which are obviously far superior to all things i have ever witnessed beforehand.
<Amorphic> Until you all shared dispenser with me
<loluntilmypie> EASY FEET
<Dman> At this point, my dearest friends, i must conclude, that the multiplication of positive social behaviour indeed is not a hard thing to do, and thus it shall be done in a very common and consensual way from now on.

<Jenemmy2> For the apple family~
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The musical number "At the Gala" is a sound-alike for Sondheim's "Ever After". This is the second musical number that takes after Sondheim's work, the other one being Rarity's Dressmaking Song. The song also may or may not have been thematically inspired by the musical number, "A Night to Remember", anticipating Senior Prom.

<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: There was plenty of foreshadowing for the main cast's disappointments in this episode throughout the season: Rarity's slight knowledge of the Gala from her past gown sales, the snootiness of various visiting Canterlot characters, and even Applejack's own foalhood experiences with her relatives, the Oranges ofManehattan.

<DesSur> Don't worry everyone, we're just taking a trip to SPAAAACCCEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
<LexieSapphire> Go the farthest in Space. Be the best at Space.
<NewDCD> 9This is the story of the predecessors of Celestia and Luna
<Ziltoid> I never finished portal
<drf|laptop> 03not realrl
<RainBroDash> NAWW SILVERMANE :3
<drf|laptop> 03*really
<NewDCD> 9and that's how Equestria was made
<drf|laptop> 03I listen to music all the time
<drf|laptop> 03otherwise driving is just so boring
<EdwardNewgate> Getting bored of space...
<SilverMane> that was indeed directed at you RBD! And everypony else, but mostly you
<LexieSapphire> MFW Pinkie's cutie mark is Kamen Rider
<RainBroDash> edwardnewgate, are you space?
<Flutter1> Aponymous I'm always tempted to post the text art from it, but it would fill up the screen XD
<RobotPinkie> TASUKETE KUREEEE
<EdwardNewgate> Yes, son
<DesSur> This is a lot better than Puma Man, in the sense that Black is a hero to be actually taken seriously.
<NewDCD> 9DYNAMIC RESCUING
<EdwardNewgate> Now we are family again
<RainBroDash> xD
<SilverMane> ^win
<Glacymr> 12that's why you play a video game while doing it
<RainBroDash> 10also, teal
<drf|laptop> 03NonstopRam has made a comment on Sonic The Hedgehog on RetroGEN:
<Aponymous> PU-MA MAN! HE FLIES LIKE A MORON!
<drf|laptop> 03If you play the games long enough, you get use to the sound.
<SilverMane> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Glacymr> 12some people just love living on the edge
<Fengor> this show has so much jump cutting
<drf|laptop> 03Somebody has no quality standards
<SilverMane> DAT TEAL
<Flutter1> Of course we arent ok!
<RainBroDash> 10sTEALing the limelight
<NewDCD> 9it's from the 80s, cut it some slack brah
<LexieSapphire> teal deer
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGhm8R9QySg <- Seriously, anybody who knows the original Sonic game... tell me if that sounds even remotely acceptable
<SilverMane> lol, funny, because NewDCD has lime text
<ScriptBot> [1,0You0,4Tube]: Sonic The Hedgehog on RetroGEN | by DRFInPerson | Length: | Views: 151
<RobotPinkie> Jump cutting is what built Japan.
<Aponymous> I KNEW IT! This seemed ridiculously '80s!
<Ziltoid> Why are we watching this?
<RainBroDash> 10oohohohohoh
<Glacymr> 12one of these days i'm going to make the production of high quality sound illegal
<DesSur> Because, this is BLACK.
<DesSur> The best.
<RainBroDash> 10ziltoid why the fuck not?!
<Dman> Oh no you di'nt, Rainbrodash
<Glacymr> 12just to irritate drf :)
<Fengor> because it validates our manlyness after watching ponies for 10 hours
<Aponymous> Because Kamen Rider.
<LexieSapphire> Once you go BLACK, you never go back.
<Ziltoid> Obviously I am wrong
<RainBroDash> 10oh yes I di'id dman
<Rellekz> Because Europe
<SilverMane> i watched Detroit Metal City on Saturday. From it, I have learned the greatest pick up line in history
<Polarfire> Ponies ARE manly.
<EdwardNewgate> Because business
<DesSur> Because, this is now [BronyState Swim], and I wasn't aware of this.
<Aponymous> >Implying watching Ponies doesn't validate our manliness.
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane, repeat?
<Dman> xP
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03what
<SilverMane> I'm going to fucking rape you, you pig bitch!
<NewDCD> 9Silvermane: you mean RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE?
<SilverMane> best pick up line ever
<RainBroDash> 10O_O
<EdwardNewgate> That's really creepy
<Flutter1> Fengor I thought watching ponies did validate out manliness
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12why did i misread DRFInPerson
<LexieSapphire> FOREVEEEEER
<DesSur> It's a floating Pinata?
<Glacymr> 12as DRFInPrison
<SilverMane> NewDCD! Not the 11-rapes-in-one-second!
<RainBroDash> 10This looks like a zelda boss scenario
<Flutter1> ah, apony beat me
<Aponymous> wat
<RobotPinkie> The effects really aren't all that shit considering.
<Flutter1> :(
<Fengor> it does, but it never hurts to add a little reinforcement afterwords, Flutter1
<SilverMane> he cut his tongue to do that
<NewDCD> 9JINGU NO TAIGO?!
<Aponymous> Yeah, this is pretty good for the '80s.
<Ascendant> well, drf in prison would be sad
<Ascendant> because then i'd have to break him out
<Ascendant> ):
<LexieSapphire> TASKETEEEE!
<Fengor> sooo, their plan is to stop Kamen Rider with shitty modern art?
<Ziltoid> OH NO SPIDERWEBS
<NewDCD> 9and not America, too
<DesSur> On the subject of the 80s, I suggest that we watch Fist of the North Star.
<Aponymous> Problem, Flutter1?
<RobotPinkie> Plus made for TV
<Ziltoid> HALP
<Polarfire> GOKAI CHANGE
<Glacymr> 12you'd have to beat us to it Ascendant
<NewDCD> 9>implying we won't eventually
<Glacymr> 12we're kind of closer than you
<RainBroDash> 10Polarfire I lol'd hard
<drf|laptop> 03nah
<SilverMane> hey RBD, did Reticentsmolder/photoFINISHHIM ever finish his story?
<LexieSapphire> When does he Henshin?
<Ascendant> XD
<drf|laptop> 03Glacymr would come visit me and be like the guy from the Simpsons who just points and goes "haha" all day
<Polarfire> XD
<DesSur> NewDCD: Damn it, meng.
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane if he did tonight, then yes. but as of today he hadn't
<nickstr> Nelson
<Ziltoid> dat laugh
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<NewDCD> 9YAMEROOOOOOOOO!! Ah, Kotaro's OTHER Catchphrase, aside from ONORE GOLGOM
<nickstr> that does not sound right
<SilverMane> ah, alrighty. hopefully he gets it done soon so he can focus on his mane project
<Glacymr> 12yay someone backing me up
<nickstr> wrong pitch, wrong speed
<Fengor> "oh god why does it keep coming on us?!"
<SilverMane> also, inb4 Mane becomes official synonym for main
<Glacymr> 12oh..
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Glacymr> 12big help
<RainBroDash> 10silvermane what's his current mane project?
<NewDCD> 9>yfw I'm writing a fic of Spike as a Kamen Rider
<NewDCD> 9>but you already knew that
<RainBroDash> 10I'm intrigued
<drf|laptop> 03The RetroGEN basically destroys ANY Genesis game's sound
<RobotPinkie> Wow
<nickstr> even the Genesis emulator on the PSP plays it more accurately
<DesSur> HENSHIN
<NewDCD> 9SEIZURE TIME
<Aponymous> Main? thats not how you spell mane! Silly Filly.
<LexieSapphire> BANKAI - oh, sorry.
<drf|laptop> 03so I shelled up for a Genesis Nomad, as even though the screen in it sucks, it's awesome
<DesSur> >Kamen Rider BLACK: Screw your seizures.
<Fengor> guile theme go!
<drf|laptop> 03and I need to find someone to replace the screen with a LCD
<Espeon> 06night :P
<Ziltoid> BAMF
<RobotPinkie> It's ALWAYS henshin
<drf|laptop> 03it's been done before XD
<EdwardNewgate> GOMU GOMU NO-oops
<Kosoveon> night espeon
<Flutter1> Anyone read Fallout Equestria? Urimas is making a sprite version :D
<Ascendant> seeya Xeli
<Ascendant> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Ascendant for 9 minutes
<SilverMane> he's writing a semi-sad shipping fic, also starring Silver Mane, of which he and I spent two hours talking during stream a few weeks back about. it's where he got a lot of the backgorund and personality for Sm that he wrote
<Aponymous> Not as seizure inducing as that one Pokemon episode.
<Ascendant> :p
<SilverSonic> ;p
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane that actually sounds awesome
<EdwardNewgate> Aren't they all seizure enducing?
<Dman> Sorry NewDCD, black is a show you recommended AND i wanna see, but i've been busy and am now checking 3 days of missed ED stuff >_<
<RainBroDash> 10Make sure I get a link when he eventually finishes
<Fengor> I would actually like to see that seizure inducing pokemon episode
<Dman> Still, thanks for your suggestions and ideas of the shows, i have 'em saved : P
<DesSur> The Pokemon incident was the biggest of its kind to send a lot of schoolchildren to the hospital.
<Rellekz> lol
<DesSur> RIP HIS HEAD.
<SilverMane> he's offered to let us read the current progress of it, and at first I said no, but I think I'll read it to help him out, since I offered to help him with it as it is
<LexieSapphire> Their heads exploded.
<Aponymous> It was like 600 something kids right?
<DesSur> I knew he forgot to do the Rider Kick.
<DesSur> Aponymous: I believe so.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<SilverMane> and that is why you never see Porygon on the show
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane I'm a pretty beefy proof-reader, got a good idea for correct grammar innit :3
<prince-dari> rider got Spider's Webbed?
<SilverMane> and Caterpie used String Shot! It's super effective
<RainBroDash> 10suddenly: dari
<RainBroDash> 10suddenly: dari ruins the mood*
<Aponymous> OH HAI DARI!
<DesSur> That minion done goofed.
<RobotPinkie> Thankfully he doesn't have to pump up his Rider Kick like Kabuto.
<prince-dari> OHAI EVERYONE
<LexieSapphire> Damn, his music is funky.
<prince-dari> YFW I've been here the whole time. :P
<DesSur> RIDER PUNCH
<Aponymous> Moth thingy dun goofed
<SilverMane> prince-dari? What is this nonsense?
<RainBroDash> 10idea... LOL
<RobotPinkie> Or dial a number and put his cell phone on his leg like Faiz.
<DesSur> YES
<Flutter1> Facon Punch!
<RainBroDash> 10it was meant to say eye
<Fengor> Kabuto uses Fusion Kick...it's super effective!!
<RainBroDash> 10but I said it phonetically to myself, and wrote idea
<RainBroDash> 10let me off, it's 3:30
<DesSur> It was so manly, the explosion IMPLODED.
<NewDCD> 9I think I'm going to stream the Kuuga Teacher episodes
<SilverMane> lol, i was so confused
<NewDCD> 9because I seriously cried during those
<Aponymous> He kicked it so hard it imploded? Hardcore, almost Spike Tier.
<RobotPinkie> I still love Faiz the most though, no idea why.
<SilverMane> 3:30? That means when I finally hunt you down, I'll be the energetic one since it's 10:30 here
<EdwardNewgate> Suddenly, explosions
<LexieSapphire> SHIKARI SHIRO!
<Fengor> "Here let me get you out of these shitty party store spider webs!"
<SilverMane> i mean, oh you poor dear, get some rest
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane that was just the biggest fail. saying english is a strength, then having ideas for grammar.
<DesSur> YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN! OHOHOHO!
<Bjornfot> aww shit
<SilverMane> lol, my ideas involve many more V's and Z's
<Aponymous> "Good luck finding a way home, fuckers!"
<NewDCD> 9prepare your anuses for Brony Tears
<LexieSapphire> Suddenly, English.
<Bjornfot> I'm literally almost falling asleep here... night.
<prince-dari> DCD: Wut?
<DesSur> Night, Bjorn.
<RainBroDash> 10nighty night bjornfot
<SilverMane> night Bjornfot, loves and more loves
<LexieSapphire> Bye Bjorn.
<prince-dari> Night Bjornfot.
<Fengor> oh are we playing the first 10minutes of UP again NewDCD?
<EdwardNewgate> Bye Bjorn
<Barry> Question that doesn't relate to Kamen Rider. What Sentai Series does Power Rangers Samurai relate to?
<NewDCD> 9I'm playing something that makes one shed tears, but of the happy and inspirational kind
<prince-dari> This time Bjornfot leaves first.
<prince-dari> Hah.
<RainBroDash> 10also, silvermane, if that was meant to make any sense to me, it made no sense to sleepy me
<NewDCD> 9Barry: Shinkenger
<Aponymous> Night Bjjornfot! Don't get kickewd again!
<NewDCD> 9CHAN CHAN BARA
<Ziltoid> night bjornfot
<NewDCD> 9damn it
<NewDCD> 9he escaped
<NewDCD> 9next time Bjornfot
<NewDCD> 9next time
<Barry> NewDCD: Ah. Thanks
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, the English language ideas I have involve adding Z's and V's to more words
<RainBroDash> 10ahaha
<LexieSapphire> Whut about Xs?
<RainBroDash> 10Xs for the loss
<SilverMane> fuck X's
<LexieSapphire> T^T
<Aponymous> English doesn't use Z and V enough IMO.
<SilverMane> Algebra can find it on it's own
<SilverMane> not my problem anymore
<Fengor> is there a Kamne Rider movie by chance?
<RainBroDash> 10V is used enough, but not enough next to consonants
<DesSur> Fengor: Multiple.
<RainBroDash> 10I want more words like advice
<RobotPinkie> Many Kamen Rider movies.
<SilverMane> Seriously, Algebra just needs to move on and stop looking for its x, making itself look desperate like that
<RainBroDash> 10those words rock
<Arcanine> 12!silversonic
<SilverMane> Advicate
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Arcanine> 12D:
<RobotPinkie> At least one is pretty darn good.
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane, you're algebra's x aren't you?
<Winter-puff> im a fan of word that start with q
<LexieSapphire> The quality!
<SilverMane> ... yes
<Aponymous> I just want to find a way to put Z in Defenestrate.
<RainBroDash> 10crafty bugger
<SilverSonic> lol like im gonna get a ownership script ;p
<DesSur> >sad music of dying flowers
<RainBroDash> 10NO
<Arcanine> 12you never know
<RainBroDash> 10Screw you americans and your Zs man
<EdwardNewgate> AHH
<drf|laptop> 03o
<SilverMane> THE FLOWERS ARE DYING! CALL ROSE, TULIP, AND DAFFODIL
<drf|laptop> 03*no
<LexieSapphire> defenderstrate
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03SilverSonic see my video
<drf|laptop> 03'since I'm assuming you like Sonioc
<drf|laptop> 03-o
<SilverSonic> i did indeed
*Arcanine now belongs to SilverSonic for 2 seconds
<Fengor> hmm, that football says otherwise
<SilverMane> soccer ball!
<SilverSonic> thats really odd what the music sounds like on the RetroGEN
<prince-dari> The word's "defenestrate", by the way. :P
<RainBroDash> 10Linkin Park cover of Rolling in the Deep just came on on tv. I don't know what to think!
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Aponymous> Z > All of Europe, u mad?
<SilverMane> *troll face*
<drf|laptop> 03but see, get this
<drf|laptop> 03and I may have said it in the video
<LexieSapphire> No, it's defenderstrate.
<RainBroDash> 10Aponymous. I mad.
<drf|laptop> 03the RetroGEN is done by some Chinese company, but it's actually officially licensed by Sega
<prince-dari> YFW it really is defenestrate.
<drf|laptop> 03Why would Sega allow such an abomination
<LexieSapphire> That's when you throw someone through a defender.
<SilverMane> superchalifragilisticespidalidocious
<SilverSonic> i know right
<Arcanine> 12i thought sega was gone
<EdwardNewgate> How can they cover a song like ROlling in the Deep?
<LexieSapphire> Or something.
<SilverSonic> Lmfao nup
<drf|laptop> 03the Genesis Nomad may be more rare and more bulky but that thing is amazing
<NewDCD> 9LUNA
<Kosoveon> no
<EdwardNewgate> I must find it now
<NewDCD> 9AMBITIOUSLY REVIVE
<NewDCD> 9LUNA
<NewDCD> 9A PROUD ENERGY!
<Kosoveon> they just don't make hardware anymore
<drf|laptop> 03I need to find someone who knows how to do a screen replacement
<NewDCD> 9LUNA!
<SilverSonic> SEGA is alive and well Arcanine
<NewDCD> 9A REASON TO BE STRONG!
<RainBroDash> 10EdwardNewgate, Chester's voice is actually handling it quite well...
<Flutter1> Goodnight everypony outb4kick
*SilverMane salutes this Luna chant
<drf|laptop> 03the Genesis Nomad is basically the internals of the actual Genesis, with a TFT screen which is like a very primitive LCD
<Aponymous> That's a pretty slick Rider costume.
<drf|laptop> 03so it motion blurs like crazy
<LexieSapphire> LOOOVE!
<SilverMane> night Flutter1
<RainBroDash> 10but it's basically all just piano from mike, and chester singing
<NewDCD> 9EVEN IF I STAND ALONE
<Ziltoid> all the music is great
<drf|laptop> 03somebody figured out that youc an wire a LCD in there
<NewDCD> 9I WILL SURPASS THEM
<NewDCD> 9CHOU HENSHIN
<drf|laptop> 03and make it crystal clear
<NewDCD> 9KAMEN RIDER LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<drf|laptop> 03which is the only GOOD thing about the RetroGen, IMO, is the screen quality
<RainBroDash> 10>LUNA
<SilverMane> LUNAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
<SilverSonic> so it would be like a portalble Genesis?
<Aponymous> Of course all the ones I've seen have been pretty slick,
<RainBroDash> 10<333
<drf|laptop> 03that's exactly what it is
<SilverMane> inb4 Luna x SilverMane
<drf|laptop> 03that's what the RetroGEN is too, it just sucks
<Ziltoid> whisling wwu
<LexieSapphire> and then stew
<drf|laptop> 03as games without sound, or at least without good sound = DO NOT WANT
<NewDCD> 9Also
<RainBroDash> 10silvermane, fund it
<SilverMane> winter wrap up stew...
<NewDCD> 9Godai Yusuke: Ultimate Brony
<drf|laptop> 03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Nomad
<Fengor> mm, I have a sudden craving for chicken and sausage gumbo
<RobotPinkie> So was Den-O any good?
<NewDCD> 9Den-O
<Ziltoid> gumbo?
<Ziltoid> liek gummt?
<RainBroDash> 10Fengor I had this epic chicken pie for dinner. with mash and peas. twas amazing
<RobotPinkie> I watched the first couple of episodes, it just seemed... too bright and cheerful
<EdwardNewgate> gumbi?
<Ziltoid> gummy*
<NewDCD> 9's only saving Grace are Deneb, Yuuto, and sometimes the imagin
<SilverMane> i suddenly want thick chicken noodle soup with buttery biscuits
<NewDCD> 9but overall it's one of those PLEASE AVOID ME shows
<Aponymous> Den-O?
<RobotPinkie> Oh good, then I didn't miss much.
<NewDCD> 9Kamen Rider Den-O
<EdwardNewgate> He's dead
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Fengor> if you don't know what gumbo is go google it. It's a southern US food
<Aponymous> Oh, that was the shit one you were talking about the other day, right?
<Fengor> and made right it's fucking amazing
<NewDCD> 9>Godai Yusuke's "mission" is to protect people's smiles
<NewDCD> 9>Pinkie Pie's is to MAKE people smile
<EdwardNewgate> Suddenly, Chinese subtitles
<DesSur> Heaven Smiles?
<NewDCD> 9BEST DUO
<Aponymous> FUND IT!
<RobotPinkie> NO!
<Aponymous> YES
<RainBroDash> 10So. Who's excited for Across the Universe?
<prince-dari> ...
<DesSur> 8|
<prince-dari> No one. :P
<RobotPinkie> I have no idea what it is.
<DesSur> It's like...
<DesSur> Glee + The Beatles.
<Aponymous> Beatles Musical? How bad could it be?
<EdwardNewgate> Should I be?
<NewDCD> 9New DCD Trivia: You're not supposed to know what the villians, Grongi, are saying under normal circumstances. They speak a completely made-up language. The DVDs add those subtitles, though, which translate the made-up language...and spoil the whole show, so it's recommended NOT to know what they're saying the first time around
<LexieSapphire> Waaait. For the Benefit of Mister Kite?
<Aponymous> No one from Glee is in it, right?
<SilverMane> i don't get to be here this weekend. I'm going out into the woods to beat other people up with rubber sticks and bean bags
<DesSur> Aponymous: No.
<Aponymous> What a relief.
<SilverMane> The good news is, I get to ask for permission to create my Fluttershy parody character
<EdwardNewgate> That makes more sense...
<RainBroDash> 10I've never seen it. I'm keeping an open mind and just handing in my man-card for the night and trying to enjoy it! :D (inb4 I hand in my man-card every night because I'm silvermane's bitch)
<NewDCD> 9DAT LAMPSHADE
<LexieSapphire> lol 4th wall break
<NewDCD> 9SUP DETECTIVEBRO
<RainBroDash> 10That guy reminds me of Freddie Wong
<DesSur> Aponymous: It's a tolerable movie anyways. Somewhat.
<NewDCD> 9it's more like painting the fourth wall than breaking it
<RainBroDash> 10the old guy
<prince-dari> YFW I quote this all the time now "I'm silvermane's bitch" - RainBroDash.
<RainBroDash> 10Dari I believe I've said it before
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, i've seen parts of it as my mom is a massive Beetles fan. It basically incorporates Beetles songs into a story, naming major characters after song characters
<RobotPinkie> Well, if it's not bearable at least it's the last movie, right?
<RainBroDash> 10MFW: *nocareface*
*SilverMane proudly pats his bitch on the head
<prince-dari> Well that ruins my fun. *pout*
<SilverMane> it isn't a BAD movie, but it really helps if you like beetles music
<EdwardNewgate> MFW: I can't read what's on the computer and feel like I'm missing something...
<RainBroDash> 10I don't particularly dislike the beatles
<NewDCD> 9Sup Ameribro!
<Aponymous> If it ends up terrible then at least we have Army of Darkness.
<DesSur> SilverMane: How did you like Bono's rendition of a Beatles song?
<RobotPinkie> Army of Darkness is amazing.
<SilverMane> no idea, it was 3 years ago and I only watched Hey Jude and Day Dream Believer
<DesSur> Eh.
<Dermathil> eeyup, Army of Darkness is very good.
<SilverMane> indeed
<RobotPinkie> Still disappointed about the missing cuts in the "Director's Cut"
<EdwardNewgate> Give me some sugar baby
<SilverSonic> nice
<SilverMane> Army of Darkness > All other B movies > A Movies
<LexieSapphire> lonely motorbike
<Aponymous> Evil Dead is one of my favorite series, even that not so good first one.
<SilverSonic> speaking of Sonic, i just beat Sonic 2
<Dermathil> Also, RBD, Freddie Wong got to shoot with the director of the Iron-Man Movie. Also, on the Universal Studios Backlot.
<NewDCD> 9SURPRISE BUTTSEX
<EdwardNewgate> MFW: my teacher showed Army of Darkness in my Creative Writing class
<Ziltoid> the lottery is friday this wekk?
<RobotPinkie> Well, Evil Dead 2 recaps everything good about the first movie.
*SilverMane is currently printing all 71 pages of Spark, the 8part+continuation-chapter fanfic
<NewDCD> 9indeed
<Arcanine> 12bark o.o
<Ziltoid> cool
<Dermathil> yeah, Ziltoid. Hey
<Aponymous> It certainly does.
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane: >printing
<SilverMane> EdwardNewgate, fukin awesome
<SilverSonic> Rawr
<RainBroDash> 10I... why?
<SilverMane> i print off the fanfics for work
<SilverMane> i read them while I operate the laive
<Aponymous> All these fan fic references reminds me that I need to finish my first crappy MLP fic...
<SilverMane> so far I have printed about 300 pages, and have about a 2 inch thick stack of finished, printed ficx
<EdwardNewgate> Aw, I'm sure it's not crappy
<SilverMane> Aponymous, you have a herd (heh) of fanfic readers/reviewers/editors/previewers right here
<Arcanine> !say !Arcanine
<junh1024-XD> !Arcanine
<RainBroDash> 10I used to have fanfics on my phone as .pdfs, until someone grabbed my phone and climbed up a tree with it, read through most of the stuff before I could get it back. He didn't find the ponies thank god.
<Ziltoid> I wanted to read this fic it was about RBD x cloud
<RobotPinkie> I should try to put my skills to work on some fan project, but my writing sucks.
<SilverMane> Ziltoid, it was... weird
<Sdash> I use my ipad to read ponies =)
<Ziltoid> anyone know where I can read it?
<Aponymous> I'm stuck in writers block mode, I know what I wanna do, just don't know how to write it.
<RainBroDash> 10aponymous i have no qualms reading your stuff for you :)
<prince-dari> Why didn't you climb up the tree and get your phone?
<SilverMane> it was basically a solo-pony-clopfic
<LexieSapphire> I'm a longtime fanfic writer and I do beta-reading for other writers on ff.net.
<RainBroDash> 10dari I did. but it took me a while
<Barry> Zittoid: cloud as is the fluffy white stuff in the sky, or Cloud as in the main character of Final Fantasy 7
<RainBroDash> 10hence he didn't find the ponies
<EdwardNewgate> SilverMane That's... awkward
<Ziltoid> a cloud
<SilverMane> Barry, the fluffy stuff
<Ziltoid> lol
<Barry> K
<SilverMane> Rainbow Dash and a Cloud have been shipped
<NewDCD> 9you gotta give it to this show
<NewDCD> 9it really knows how to handle Atmosphere
*Kosoveon owns Arcanine for 35.4 minutes
<SilverMane> basically, she used it on herslef. and LAWL using atmosphere
<Arcanine> 12lol
*Kosoveon floofs Arcanine
<Arcanine> 12;-;
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I haven't really watched this before.
<Barry> Is that the one where she rubs herself on a cumulonimbus cloud?
<Aponymous> RainBroDash, Give me your contact info and I'll send it to you when I have enough to be worth reviewing.
<Arcanine> [!Arcanine vars reset]
<LexieSapphire> Wow. Is it just me, or does being really evil force you to overact?
<Arcanine> !say !arcanine
<junh1024-XD> !arcanine
*Arcanine now belongs to junh1024-XD for 15 minutes and has to fly junh1024-XD around until then
<RainBroDash> 10aponymous just tell me in stream some time :)
<Arcanine> 12whoops
<Arcanine> 12forgot to remove that part
<Aponymous> Evil is Hammy
<Kosoveon> XDDD
<RobotPinkie> I really enjoyed the mood of Faiz, at least in the beginning. It's unexpectedly dark.
<Aponymous> Okay then.
<Kosoveon> flying arcanines FTW
<NewDCD> 9Faiz suffered a few plot tumors though
<RobotPinkie> People going full cupcakes on their friends.
<NewDCD> 9but DAMN if it wasn't fun
<RainBroDash> 10i mean aponymous if you need a skype or something you can have it, ha. just saiyan.
<Arcanine> [!Arcanine vars reset]
<NewDCD> 9fun fact: Faiz Paradise Lost was streamed in the first Brony Movie Night
<Arcanine> 12there
<Kosoveon> !arcanine
<Barry> I see what you did thar
*Arcanine now belongs to Kosoveon for 6 minutes
<NewDCD> 9if I ever win a lottery draw
<RobotPinkie> Wow, I wish I'd known about it then.
<NewDCD> 9I might ask for Kamen Rider THE FIRST
<Kosoveon> brb
<Arcanine> 12kk
<Aponymous> My Skype is Aponymous. Add me when you get the chance, I hardly ever use it though.
<RobotPinkie> That'd be pretty awesome.
<NewDCD> 9for Movie Night, that is
<prince-dari> INB4 a mod and ChanServ win the films next lottery.
<SilverMane> i think i might try writing my first fanfic now, or at least get the opening done. hell, right here even!
<EdwardNewgate> Btw who picked Army of Darkness? Cause if I had won, that was my first choice.
<NewDCD> 9>chanserv wins the lottery
<RainBroDash> 10dari I can't wait for chanserv to win
<NewDCD> 9AW SHIT NIGGA
<Ziltoid> a mod alwasys wins
<SilverMane> inb4 chanserv chooses .hack
<RainBroDash> 10RBD mod never wins >.<
<Aponymous> I wanna brohoof whoever picked Army of Darkness.
<RobotPinkie> If I ever win the draw.... it's The Last Dragon. Because that would be a pretty awesome chat, right thar.
<LexieSapphire> BTW, I are also writing ponyfic, and would be honoured were anypony here to read what I have so far and tell me what they honestly think. :3
<SilverMane> if I ever get the B film, we are watching House (1987)
<EdwardNewgate> Definitely Fight Club
<prince-dari> Hey, look at this:
<SilverMane> i have time now, LexieSapphire
<NewDCD> 9MOTORCYCLE OBJECTION!!
<prince-dari> I killed ChanServ!
<prince-dari> :D
<Fengor> is this the third week of the new Eureka and Warehouse 13 or the second?
<NewDCD> 9MUSIC DENIED
<RobotPinkie> Denied!
<Ziltoid> lol bad
<prince-dari> MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<LexieSapphire> Kewlio SilverMane. How I show it to you?
<RainBroDash> 10EEEEEEEEP new Incubus song just came onto the TV >:3 <33 <3
<RainBroDash> 10I would most probably go gay for Brandon Boyd. Just putting it out there.
<RobotPinkie> Goddamn I wish I couldn't read that now after what you said.
<Aponymous> My A Choice is True Romance, My B choice is Killer Klowns, and my Episode choice is Dog & Pony Show.
<SilverMane> well you could make it into a Googledoc and link it to me via pm, or upload it somewhere else
<RobotPinkie> It's hard not to look at the subtitles
<Lambda> Nice post in pony spam
<SilverMane> but but but... RainBroDash, haven't I already done that to you?
<Lambda> :P
<RainBroDash> 10I mean 'officially' you silly pony
<prince-dari> XD
<SilverMane> KILLER KLOWNS
<Ziltoid> whats killer klowns?
<Lambda> if SF were google+ I'd +1 it
<Lambda> :P
*SilverMane is a silly pony
<NewDCD> 9>mfw THE FIRST can be either A or B, because while pretty good and high production values for Japan, akin to a Spiderman Film in America, sometimes the wire-fu is pretty visible
<NewDCD> 9JUST AS PLAN
<RobotPinkie> from outer space
<prince-dari> Ahaha.
<Fengor> the day I finally win the opportunity to choose B movie you will all be watching Poultrygeist
*RainBroDash 10always dresses in style
<Ziltoid> sounds something icp whould name
<SilverMane> POULTRYGEIST
<Aponymous> Killer Klowns From Outer Space is a movie about Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
<RobotPinkie> wat?
<prince-dari> I ended up singing Winter Wrap Up to people over a stream the other day.
*SilverMane dresses RainBroDash in style.
<RainBroDash> 10my backup B movie choice has been Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus from week 1
<NewDCD> 9also MAGICAL HEIGHT CHANGES
<Lambda> XD that's awesome
<prince-dari> They blackmailed me saying they wouldn't eat until I sang for them. XD
<LexieSapphire> Googledocs? Oh... (does Fluttershy face) In that case, I'd rather skip for now. It's more trouble than it's worth for a whim.
<RobotPinkie> Killer Klowns is an A movie, though
<Lambda> I'm watching that episode right now in fact
<prince-dari> Hah, we watched them all today.
<prince-dari> Had a pony marathon stream.
<RainBroDash> 10Lexiesapphire you can pastebin it :D
<RainBroDash> 10it takes 2 seconds
<SilverMane> LexieSapphire, if GD isn't good, deviant art works, or pastebin
<Aponymous> I doubt they'd care. >_>
<LexieSapphire> Well, okay. Just give me a sec.
<EdwardNewgate> I would love you if you picked Mega Shark RainBroDash
<Lambda> here are the pins we got
<Lambda> http://www.etsy.com/transaction/54392606
<SilverMane> also, DAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW @Flutter-Face
<RainBroDash> 10Then you'll love me the day I get B movie selection
<RobotPinkie> lol I wish I could get away with calling The Last Dragon an A-movie
<Lambda> only we special ordered to replace trixie with celestia
<Aponymous> Isn't Mega Shark the movie where the shark jumps into the sky and eats an airplane?
<RobotPinkie> HENSHIN!
<LexieSapphire> BTW, my reserve films are always Anchorman and Scott Pilgrim.
<RainBroDash> 10GOKAI CHANGE
<RainBroDash> 10Lexiesapphire Scott Pilgrim has been one of my backups for a while
<SilverMane> He seems awfully... HORNY
<prince-dari> Ooh. AWESOME.
<EdwardNewgate> Yes
<NewDCD> 9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Fengor> wow this villain looks like he raided Blizzard's copypasta tier armor vault
*SilverMane forgot his sunglasses
<prince-dari> Lacking in Dash badge though. :P
<RainBroDash> 10but since I always act like the cliche euromod, I've had a german language film ready to use if i get picked in the near future
<NewDCD> 9Fengor: this show is from 2000 though
<Lambda> yeah, you can mix and match
<Aponymous> If I din't love True Romance so much, I'd have Scott Pilgrim as an A choice.
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P53tt8m6vdY
<Fengor> which makes it all the stranger he did
<Barry> How many people are looking forward to G4's Marvel anime that are going to are this Friday at 11 PM?
<EdwardNewgate> Is Human Centipede and A or B movie?
<SilverMane> RainBroDash, do you think we could watch Shinlers List? or is that too dark and serious for this stream
<Ziltoid> B
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Ziltoid> I would say
<NewDCD> 9Barry I ddin't understand what you said
<RobotPinkie> :O
<SilverMane> Damn commercial breaks
<prince-dari> Die he died?
<EdwardNewgate> Barry, I would be if Directv didn't fucking get rid of G4
<Aponymous> If we can watch The Room, I think we'd be okay with Schindler's List.
<NewDCD> 9oh
<NewDCD> 9wait
<NewDCD> 9G4 as in G4 TV
<NewDCD> 9proceed
<RobotPinkie> Looks like Kamen Rider... got spiked
<Barry> Yes
<Ziltoid> YYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHh
<NewDCD> 9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane I'm not sure, it depends on mod opinions. But I'd pick Die Welle (look it up) or Die Fälscher (The Counterfeiters - look it up also) :P
<SilverMane> RobotPinkie, that's not how you spike the drink!
<Fengor> looked more like bane broke the bat, but that's just me
<prince-dari> Does the I, x... thing come from somewhere else or just that video?
<RobotPinkie> If you're doing it right!
<NewDCD> 9OH GOD PREPARE FOR AN EPISODE MADE OF MANLY AND TEARS
<prince-dari> Because bronies say things like that every so often now.
<RobotPinkie> YAY!
<Aponymous> I'd love it if someone picked Felidae, just to see chats reaction to Noir Cat Sex.
<Lambda> I, Robot is what I thought of
<SilverMane> I watched Schindlers List in 8th grade, and none of my HS teachers believed me. Apparently 14 year olds can't handle gas chambers, peeing nazis, and naked old women
<Lambda> thought it'd be a spoof trailer
<RainBroDash> 10SilverMane we watched it in R.S. when I was 14 too :D
<EdwardNewgate> If I won the A movie, could I pick an animated movie? Such as Cowboy Bebop?
<NewDCD> 9IMPORTANT DCD TRIVIA: The Thumbs-Up is COOLGUY'S/Godai Yusuke's most iconic pose
<Ziltoid> fix the window
<Fengor> we need to watch Fritz the cat, first animated film to ever receive and X rating at the box office
<RainBroDash> 10ziltoid no u
<Lambda> still though
<Ziltoid> newdcd
<SilverMane> OMFG I just picked my A-movie. Full metal Alchemist's movie
<NewDCD> 9he does the thumbs up almost once an episode
<Lambda> a truer tale has never been told than that video's story
<RainBroDash> 10Silvermane won
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Barry> How many Harry Potter films are A movies?
<SilverMane> i still haven't seen it, although I finished both seasons
<Arcanine> 12what?
<RainBroDash> 10barry all of them
<Arcanine> 12stop with the face train
<SilverMane> technically all of them Barry
<Barry> all 8?
<Fengor> the budget is insane on a potter movie so all of them
<Ziltoid> the movie is weird
<RainBroDash> 10yep barry
<Barry> How many saw the final one?
<EdwardNewgate> Ziltoid, which movie?
<RainBroDash> 10irrespective of budget, we consider them a movies. i believe all other mods would agree
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Ziltoid> fma movie
<prince-dari> The 'PLOT'.
<EdwardNewgate> Barry, I did
<prince-dari> The word plot hole is forever ruined for me now.
<SilverMane> apparently I have read 114 fanfics out of 945, with 6 currently being read, on my EQD fanfic list. not bad, given i've just now been a herd member for 3 months
<Barry> It broke box office records
<NewDCD> 9you gotta appreciate a show without a boring invincible hero
<EdwardNewgate> It CRUSHED box office records
<Aponymous> I just realized I'm a 20 year old college student spending his monday night talking about MLP fics while watching Kamen Rider, my life is fucking awesome.
<SilverMane> I saw the last one. was good, but short. That was probably going to happen anyways though
<SilverMane> Aponymous... me too
<Light_Latias> 12crash
<Winter-puff> ditto
<Barry> Yeah, Part 1 took the bulk of it
<Fengor> i was at midnight premiere for last one
<RainBroDash> 10aponymous I'm at my best mate's house, staying up after he's gone to bed, to discuss ponies and shipping with other pony fans while watching kamen rider
<SilverMane> i did the midnight premier for part one
<Barry> I saw it during its weekend premiere
<Barry> for free
<EdwardNewgate> I was pissed when they didn't talk about Dumbledore's past
<LexieSapphire> kk, I've uploaded mah fic to Google Docs. ^_^
<Aponymous> This chat is full of awesome people.
<Fengor> i was at the midnight premiere for the first one as well
<SilverMane> I'm at my college tech center, printing off fanfic to read at work tomorrow, talking about ponies, watching japanese shows, and getting shipped to other colts despite being straight male.
<Ziltoid> whos awesome?youre awesome
<Barry> My brother and father got free movie tickets for donating blood
<NewDCD> 9also I think I'm going to reair today the first episode of OOOs, just because I can
<SilverMane> cool cool, Lexiesapphire, you can pm me the link and I'll read it now.
<Fengor> OOOs?
<Barry> "OOO"?
<LexieSapphire> How to PM?
<Barry> lol
<Aponymous> Barry's dad and brother are also awesome.
<Ziltoid> OOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Aponymous> OOO was cool. I approve.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Barry> My brother watched it with me, but my dad has yet to see Part 1
<Winter-puff> awsome newDCD
<SilverMane> click my name in the who's-here list
<drf|laptop> 03at least we don't have people doing emoticon tripling here

<Barry> which I have on DVD
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03:|
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<drf|laptop> 03...LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<Dashite> I'm back. What's on now?
<Barry> One of my complaints is that Part 1 didn't explain about the Taboo.
<SilverMane> I've donated blood once, tried once before then, and had horrible physiological reactions.
<Fengor> oh shit Bane's still alive
<EdwardNewgate> Sounds like he's willfully ignorant
<Light_Latias> 12o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> What is so funny?
<HyperMetalLugia> o_o
<Ascendant> bbl
<RobotPinkie> Haven't seen any OOO
<HyperMetalLugia> Seeyas
<Barry> Which would leave those who didn't read the book confused as to how Xenofilius Lovegood called The Snatchers by saying the Dark Lord's name
<Aponymous> Fengor just reminded me that I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DARK KNIGHT RISES! BANE MUTHAFUCKER!
<drf|laptop> 03darn you Ascendant :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww :<

<NewDCD> 9What do you guys think of HP Next-Gen?
<Aponymous> Probably Fall/Winter, haven't checked the date.
<Barry> This Autumn, I Think
<Fengor> I don't want there to be an HP Next-Gen
<NewDCD> 9should we get some canon insight into the next-gen characters?
<RobotPinkie> Why does he remind me of the guy from Jikou Keisatsu?
<SilverMane> Alright, first problem with your story lexieSapphire: You forgot to start it with 'SilverMane is best pony'
<SilverMane> *troll face*
<SilverMane> sorry, couldn't resist. ego is flaring up today
<SilverMane> (why is no one talking?)
<EdwardNewgate> So, is Bane rogue? Like, do both sides want to kill him?
<Barry> I think that would be a good sequel series
<Barry> too bad Rowling won't expand on it
<NewDCD> 9I want some description on the next gen characters, but that's it
<Dashite> Arkham City is October 18-21.

<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder why
<Kosoveon> "everyone explode now"
<Kosoveon> o.o
<NewDCD> 9a few short story/snippets featuring the next-gen characters. Not another series. Just...a slice of the life of the next-gen characters
<Arcanine> 12yes
<prince-dari> :P
<NewDCD> 9according to my research
<prince-dari> Lambda just becaome 20% cooler.
<NewDCD> 9it's pretty much Harry Potter: The Social Network
<Barry> Like what she did with James and Sirius
<Fengor> I just read that in Dorothy Ann's voice from magic school bus
<Barry> in that one shot
<SilverMane> or she could tell us stories about the dead characters lives
<Aponymous> MLP has made me appreciate Slice of Life stuff more.
<Lambda> XD wow
