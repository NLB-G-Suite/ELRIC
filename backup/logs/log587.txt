<Sulverscreen> 01,11Yes, a few aspects are old hat and cliche, but the story is creative and original, the design is enjoyably dark, the characters, while kinda cliche, are enjoyable and at least a little memorable, and above all, it has this sense of timlessness to it, just like almost any project Henson's been a part of.
<sergio_scriptor> Sundaysmile: FLASH GORDON
<otakon> Shizuka: a'wwww
*lakingsfans yells "your movie is bad and you should feel bad!!"
<Sundaysmile> The original?
<Meanwhile> Fizzgig/10
<flutterguy97> I love this movie
<AttacktheAndalite> aaaaaaaaaaaaa/10
<sergio_scriptor> Sundaysmile: yep :)
<MadSurge> Sulverscreen: Yeah, it's an interesting movie

<Pale_Horse> Urzah?
<rem-dog> With the made up languages and stuff, Sundaysmile.
<Starchaser> mmmm/10
<LordDerpington> One-winged Angel?
<CriticKitten> It's interesting, certainly. But I wouldn't call it good just because it was dark or original. It's "meh" overall.
<Lil_B> /10
<Demiurge> haha
<Demiurge> SEPHIROTH!

<sergio_scriptor> MrPipin: first we get the pony episode :)
<FairysHuff|Migraine> This film scared the crap out of me as a child. I love it now.
<Sulverscreen> 01,11MMMMMMMMM/10

<St-Gullick> Strange Film, good, ...but strange
<Kandarihu> aeiou/10
<Squallken> good movie, but as far as dark fantasies go: Secret of Nimh > Dark Crystal
<CrazyHippie1234> Because PONIES
<Shizuka> 13you and your EIGHTIES

<FairysHuff|Migraine> Shizuka 80s rule
<otakon> Squallken: we REALLY need to watch SoN here
<Tovler> I couldn't get in to it. meh/10
<Kencolt> One must note WHEN it was made, and for what audience originally. As noted before, it probably would have done better in the US were it not for parents who were worried about their children being unduly frightened.
<St-Gullick> yay more Krummhorns
<sergio_scriptor> Spectrum_Rush|: i did it first :
<otakon> Shizuka: the 80's were AWESOME!
*RainBowJack dances
<Eli> they give us CMC, right?
<Dark92EnigmaV2> Once again......i gotta say this was a very interesting movie....the visuals were creative, the philosophy was engaging..........the characters while a little cliche, are still enjoyable, and still with it's flaws, and dark scenes, it still hold up today as a timeless classic, kinda like Jim Henson's Muppets meet NeverEnding Story........i give it a 8.6.
<St-Gullick> reminds me of Gryphon
<Saturn> 08,01crumhorns? in my pony episode?
<otakon> Kencolt: did you SEE the soul stealing scene?
<Lil_B> Then 90s... DDDDDUUUUUUDDDDEEEE
<lakingsfans> what was this movie called?
<StormFox> it would kind of interesting if mlp did a small crossover or parody of this
<alexxm> i'd give it an 8/10
<sergio_scriptor> lakingsfans: the dark crystal
<otakon> I give it a 7.5/10
<Sulverscreen> 01,11I openly laugh at the overprotected parents that claim this movie isn't for kids.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Sumica: is it lottery first or pony ep, i cant remember
<Saturn> 08,01St-Gullick: also, i'm impressed someone in here knows what a crumhorn is
<otakon> interesting journey but lousy characters
<FairysHuff|Migraine> lakingsfans Attack of the giant mud divining fish people and the jelly from mars
<otakon> Saturn: the hell is a crumhorn?
<lakingsfans> i laugh at you HAHA!
<RainBowJack> the short version of Lord of the Rings
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: it's a kind of medieval musical instrument
<Dark92EnigmaV2> Sulverscreen: even with it's dark scenes, it's still recommendable, and a must-see
<Barbetos|AtWork> for torture
<Barbetos|AtWork> ?
<St-Gullick> @Saturn I'm an Lutist wannabe and recorderülayer, I should now
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: double reeded, i believe

*DJNilla hugs Shizuka tight
<Chrysalis> no, but ill at least then have some semblance of artistic merit
<Shizuka> 13We will be stripping the names from the lottery and posting the full list of entries, with invalid votes marked red. This way you can all learn what does and doesn't count in each category.
<DJNilla> 06und if you support VixShizuka then say Derpy after the -m! c:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And check and see if the movie is eligible for reshow. We have a past movies list on the site.

*Rain is trying to remember what she wanted to tell otakon last night
<Spectrum_Rush|> if otakon is banned then who will take his thrown as most kicked
<FairysHuff> Shizuka: Any plans to either move the timer to the top right or remove the cut out during intermissions in the future?
<sergio_scriptor> i shall pass in the test :)
<Meanwhile> Rain: He probably spelt something wrong.
<Shizuka> 13not my cutout
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dinky and Derpy, so adorable.
<AttacktheAndalite> Dalekkahn: What quiz? I didn't study

<Meanwhile> Rain: He has a large head?
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, was there a problem with my entry?
*Rain tires to remember

<Nabronyan> Ew, COD :L
<cachi01> yeah and also a halo reach clan
<MaxTheBrony> Heh :) Im Not the guy who should be running a guild :)
<Michael> who want's one TF2 dedicated server for BS?
<Polydunami> Hm? What's going on now?
<Nabronyan> MaxTheBrony: Guild for what?
<MaxTheBrony> Nabronyan: Gw2
<cachi01> Michael: MEEE
<Pinkies4thWall> otakon: chrome AND firefox are brokemn
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<AttacktheAndalite> Summer Wars is done. Finally
<Pinkies4thWall> *broken
<otakon> Pinkies4thWall: it's your flash then, update it
<cachi01> AttacktheAndalite: summer wars is awesome
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: cool beans. I'm gonna go sylvari necro for WvW and asura Warrior for sPvP and PvE
<Allegr0> just for the lolz
<Polydunami> Summer Wars? Now there's a movie I'd like to see again :3
<otakon> Pinkies4thWall: clear cache, clear history, check version, disable ANT video downloader if you have it
<AttacktheAndalite> cachi01: I just finished downloading it. I think it finished a few hours ago but oh well
<MaxTheBrony> You gotta love the Asura with a hammer xD so cute
<otakon> Polydunami: you just might
<Allegr0> MaxTheBrony: I like them for their /laugh emote and their witty golems
<Sumica> 00,10oh right tribes uses the flag has to be at home to be able to cap it
<Polydunami> I first saw it about two or three years ago.
<Meanwhile> Well if it didn't it'd be over faster than it is anyway.
<Polydunami> Or something...
<Meanwhile> Recon speed is lunacy.
<AttacktheAndalite> I saw it the first time a couple nights ago on here.
<cachi01> ^
<Spectrum_Rush|> oh otakon http://wigflip.com/roflbot/ is bit better in then memegenerator imo
<MaxTheBrony> Allegr0: I havent seen them emotes yet :D that i gotta se
<otakon> goddamn now THAT was a jump
<Polydunami> So this game. What is it?
<Allegr0> MaxTheBrony: just look it up on youtube, they literally rofl
<cachi01> Polydunami: tribes ascend
<Polydunami> I see.
<Michael> damn, i'm tired :(
<Sumica> 00,10fast respauns
<CriticKitten> Allger0: Seems good. I'm hoping we end up with a BronyState guild at some point, too. :P
<Fisheh_Fish> [MILF]
<MaxTheBrony> haha xD so cute asura , rolling and tapping the floor xD
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: or at least have some organized brony guild, like with reddit folks and the like
<cachi01> dem MILFS
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush|: nice, thanks but this is what I did http://cheezburger.com/6464910592
<Polydunami> By the way, Allegr0, I'm afraid I'm going to miss tonight's stream. I'm away for the whole evening :/
<Michael> lol
<Polydunami> Pinkie Pie truly is a pain in the ass :3
<Allegr0> Polydunami:that's fine :) , just be on the lookout for next week's show :P
<MaxTheBrony> Im going to stay up until 3 pm xD thats when the stream starts , and i will stay as long as my mind can bare :)
<cachi01> Polydunami: DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Allegr0> Polydunami: and make sure to ask around for the question of the week!
<Spectrum_Rush|> otakon: http://i.imgur.com/924vm.jpg me to :D
<MegaMoonShine> What stream?
<MaxTheBrony> With Giga and Allegro
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<otakon> lol Spectrum_Rush|
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: Aye. Anything of that nature would be good. I may avoid the forums come release, though. They're rather nasty at times.
<Polydunami> Hm? I didn't know anything about a question of the week :S
<otakon> dammit we need WREKMENTARY!
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: aren't all official forums? :P
<Michael> wut
<otakon> anyway brb again
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: GW2's is especially bad though. The fanboism borders on fanticism.
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' everyone, who's streaming? :)
<cachi01> hi AdamTheDuck
<cachi01> wrek is
<Polydunami> Hey there AdamTheDuck!
<MegaMoonShine> Mornin' AdamTheDuck wrek is :)
<Michael> sup AdamTheDuck
<MaxTheBrony> Heya AdamTheDuck
<CriticKitten> Don't dare even imply that something might be wrong with their perfect game, or they'll burn you at the stake :p
<MaxTheBrony> O.o AdamTheDuck is it morning for you?
<AdamTheDuck> yep MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Where do you live?
<dainbow_rash> and what game is this?
<Polydunami> Also, cachi01, I don't think Pinkie Pie is a pain in the butt or anything.
<AdamTheDuck> Australia
<MaxTheBrony> dainbow_rash: Tribes
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<cachi01> Polydunami: :)
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: true, though ANet is trying really hard to moderate it well
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: they've done better than most companies I've seen
<Spectrum_Rush|> nvm that message Allegr0 just checked
<Polydunami> None of the mane six are worst ponies in my opinion.
<MaxTheBrony> I sure hope that Gw2 Doesnt Fail like Swtor did
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Michael> well, Gnight everypony, i'm to tired tonight :)
<MaxTheBrony> Good night Michael :)
<Polydunami> I just wish I could see more of Applejack in the show itself :S
*AdamTheDuck hugs cachi01 , MegaMoonShine , Polydunami, Michael and MaxTheBrony. Whoa thats a long list
<cachi01> applejack doesnt get the love she deserves
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<MaxTheBrony> I love AJ ^^
<dainbow_rash> dem freckles
<MegaMoonShine> I'm heading off too. Thanks for another awesome movie night guys! :)
<Polydunami> i liek frekulz :3
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: Eh, to a minimal degree.
<Polydunami> ... Okay, that was obnoxious :S
<MaxTheBrony> Night MegaMoonShine
<Waffles> byeee MegaMoonShine
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Waffles
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<AdamTheDuck> Night MegaMoonShine
<Polydunami> Goodnight MegaMoonShine!
<Meanwhile> Sumica you present?
<Waffles> HI MaxTheBrony :$
<otakon> bye MegaMoonShine take care
<Sumica> 00,10yeah what's up
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: For example I saw a guy get ripped apart by posters for (not kidding) suggesting that Rangers should start with a sword or bow instead of a throwing axe. >_>
<Meanwhile> Sumica: why does it say I can never win under the "how movies are chosen" bit on the rules page?
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: yeah...people are gonna do that :/
<Spectrum_Rush|> wow iwas just gonna ask you that Meanwhile
<Sumica> 00,10eh?
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: And I was like "Um, dude has a point, the GW2 homepage states that Rangers are masters of the bow. And traditional RPG Ranger classes do also wield swords iconically....but NOT throwing axes."
<AdamTheDuck> Dat sudden rock music xD
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: People were like "Durr hurr but GW2 is different herp"
<Sumica> 00,10Where does it say that Meanwhile?
<Polydunami> http://www.bronystate.net/faq/ The hell?
<MaxTheBrony> Dat Battle Rock :)
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: lol
<otakon> Sumica: the very bottom
<Meanwhile> Sumica: FAQ "How are the Brony Movie Night movies chosen?"
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: fanbois will be fanbois
<MaxTheBrony> CriticKitten: What class and race are you ging to play?`?
<MaxTheBrony> going*Ä
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: No kidding. But you'd think their mothers had been insulted, some of 'em.
<Polydunami> Surely this is just a joke.
<Sumica> 00,10who's oatmeal did you piss in Meanwhile?
<CriticKitten> MaxTheBrony: I've got several characters planned, but I'll main a Sylvari Ranger. It seems the most effective combination I've witnessed
<MaxTheBrony> Ah :D
<MaxTheBrony> Btw What does the Asura have as Pet?
<Meanwhile> Sumica: I don't know. To be honest, you can keep it there if you want I just wanted to know why it was there.
<MaxTheBrony> And sylvary
<MaxTheBrony> sylvari*
<pony_7384> ola
*cachi01 eats ALL the oatmeal
<Polydunami> It seems like a joke to me.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya pony_7384
<Sumica> 00,10Not entirely sure Meanwhile. I am sure some one was trying to be cute.
<Meanwhile> Personally it made me giggle.
<Dovah> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/292973_385293041536245_953788840_n.jpg
<Pinkies4thWall> My computer is broken. FUCK MY LIFE
<CriticKitten> MaxTheBrony: Sylvari gets to choose between a moa, a fern dog, and a stalker kitty.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: i eagerly await the day your choice comes up... just to see waht happens :D
<CriticKitten> Dunno about asura.
<pony_7384> :)
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Pinkies4thWall> hyjmnu
<pony_7384> :D
<pony_7384> :(
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush|: "Rerolled because Meanwhile"
<pony_7384> :S
<pony_7384> ;);););););)
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: almost sounds like an unfinished sentence there
<MaxTheBrony> pony_7384: Please dont spam Emotes ^^
<cachi01> oh we are watching scott pilgrim? WOOHOOO
<Kandarihu> Wow, I was watching and thought to myself that Wrek's having the same problem that I do... then he made a sweet kill, and I realized that he's still better than me.
<Kandarihu> Skill =/=/= level
<cachi01> sex =/=/= 100
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut?>
<Polydunami> Yeah... Scott Pilgrim... woo hoo.
<cachi01> the ammount of ammusement in Polydunami is TOO DAMN HIGH
<AdamTheDuck> God I'm really starting to hate that announcer's voice...
<Dovah> slow chat or my computer derping again?
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, that's the Diamond Sword announcer.
<Sumica> 00,10oh did you win a WMC movie Meanwhile
<cachi01> slow chat Dovah
<Meanwhile> Sumica: I've only ever won a pony episode. And that was a year ago.,
<cachi01> lol
<AdamTheDuck> Well this guy doesn't sound so bad ;)
<Sumica> 00,10this reminds me of wow battle grounds
<cachi01> pootis
<Ann> How goes life folks?
<Sumica> 00,10ingnore any one in the midfield
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Ann :)
<cachi01> a milf killed wrek
<cachi01> hi Ann!
<Ann> Ah, this is that "free-2-play" game with jetpacks and such eh?
<cachi01> Eeyup
<otakon> Ann: and rockets!
<otakon> Ann: and going 200mph
<Ann> I've been wondering if it's worth the download.
<cachi01> and skiing
<Ann> o.O
<String_Shredder> diamond sword!
<Sumica> 00,10not so much on rockets
<Kandarihu> Ann, it is
<Polydunami> I don't get it; why is Perfect Blue considered a B movie?
<Ann> *puts on dl list*
<Sumica> 00,10more spinfusors and fusion morters
<otakon> Ann: well it's free so unless you're on a dataplan it wouldn't hurt to check it
<otakon> Polydunami: Anime
<Polydunami> 5 Centimetres per Second is an A movie.
<Ann> Well, I'm actually stealing my neighbours net because my ISP is being... beligerant >.<
<otakon> Polydunami: there is no anime out there that is A except for maybe Miyazaki movies
<Spectrum_Rush|> ok operation make homemade pizza was a success
<Polydunami> Or is eligible to be an A movie.
*Spectrum_Rush| dances to the pizza
<Kandarihu> I used to vote for One Piece Movie 10 as an A Movie.
<otakon> Kandarihu: if only man, if only
<AdamTheDuck> otakon: What about end of evangelion?
<otakon> Kandarihu: the ONLY canon movie
<otakon> AdamTheDuck: screw that noise
<Ann> All this talk about pizza and movies makes me want to watch Samurai Pizza Cats again.
<pony_7384> ;)
<AdamTheDuck> :S
<otakon> Ann: good taste!
<Ann> Best joke dub ever.
<Polydunami> Medium is not enough to be B-movie material.
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<cachi01> my team lost
<otakon> AdamTheDuck: I'm sorry I don't like NGE at all. I don't like the characters or the situation at BEST the mech and technical designs are awesome.
<otakon> well for me at best
<Dovah> its been 8 months since I last tried to buy minecraft. Should I try again?
<MaxTheBrony> Has any streamer streamed Korra , Adventure time , or any of those types?
<AdamTheDuck> I understand, it's not for everyone
<otakon> Dovah: do yo9u have enought money?
<cachi01> MaxTheBrony: korra yes
<Polydunami> You know what else was eligible as an A movie? Grave of the Fireflies
<Dovah> otakon: yes
<Ann> Adventure Time = <3
<Polydunami> :'(
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<Ann> 3
<otakon> MaxTheBrony: Korra yes, Adventrue Time no
<icybeauti> I come for my dily dose of pony...and whatever this game is. BTW heya everypony.
<otakon> I wish Adventure Time, but not eveyone's cup of tea and hiya icybeauti
<AdamTheDuck> ohai icybeauti
<cachi01> hi icybeauti!! u late ponies already ended
<MaxTheBrony> Adventure time episodes are perfect for intermission :)
<Ann> I've just started watching Avatar (third episode) so Korra wouldn't mean anything for me.
<Polydunami> So your anime argument is invalid.
<icybeauti> heya otakon cachi01 AdamTheDuck MaxTheBrony
<Fisheh_Fish> Guys, I got some great news! My dad got approved for a liver transplant at Duke Hospital! :)
<MaxTheBrony> Ann: The last air bender :D? It is awesome :)
<Dovah> Ann: korra has nothing to do with Atla
<MaxTheBrony> Heya icybeauti ^^
<icybeauti> I had to go to bed. I had to pick up my cheerleading stuff
<Ann> I thought it was a prequil or some such?
<Ann> [spelling]
<MaxTheBrony> Dovah: Not so much but it is really awesome felling to see the old cast as adults
<AdamTheDuck> Fisheh_Fish: congratulations
<Fisheh_Fish> AdamTheDuck: Thank you :)
<icybeauti> for some reason, my spelling is always worst on this site.
<MaxTheBrony> Fisheh_Fish: Thats awesome :D
<Dovah> MaxTheBrony: yeah but you wont be missing anything if you watch Korra first
<Polydunami> Also, you can't tell me that split second clips of nudity disqualifies the movie from A movie status; after all, Requiem for a Dream had full frontal nudity and was still considered an A movie.
<Ann> I'm not even going to lie, spell check destroyed my spelling. I do try to make an effort now though.
<MaxTheBrony> Dovah: Only Emtionaly ^^
<MaxTheBrony> Emotionaly*
<icybeauti> I spent last night watching a doc on north korea, began a Q episode, then watch some pony. Then I went to bed after some pony,
<icybeauti> *computer
<MaxTheBrony> heh
<Dovah> Wait Requiem for a dream was once streamed here and I missed it!?!
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Ann> So, what movie are we bebating is "A" or "B"?
<MaxTheBrony> Both :D
<icybeauti> I still never learned how to enter the lotto, and I did sign up for the newsletter.
<Polydunami> Perfect Blue seems to be classified as a B movie.
<MaxTheBrony> The shark movie?
<MaxTheBrony> Oh nvm
<MaxTheBrony> I thought about Deep blue sea for somereason
<Polydunami> I didn't know there was a shark movie called Perfect Blue.
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<MaxTheBrony> Wrong movie
<icybeauti> THERE ARE OTHER EPISODES PICKED BESIDES FLUTTERSHY!!!
<Polydunami> I was looking at the spreadsheet for this week's lottery picks, actually.
<Ann> Deep blue is an anime is it not?
<Polydunami> Perfect Blue.
<Ann> er yes
<Ann> That's what I meant.
<Polydunami> Directed by Satoshi Kon.
<icybeauti> and the last roundup was picked. I'm quiet happy about that.
<Dovah> so otakon should I try to buy minecraft again or no?
<Polydunami> And still labeled as a B movie.
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh what's that movie? With the goldfish girl?
<icybeauti> I know what the A movie is, but I've never heard of the B.
<Ann> So, what really classes something as B movie. Since it's budget based, primarily, what does one have to spend on a movie to make it "A" these days?
<MaxTheBrony> I think they should stream Battle Royal :3
<icybeauti> Ann A is like big blockbuster and B is hipster movie.
<AdamTheDuck> And she likes eating ham. Uhh what is it called?...
<MaxTheBrony> Poyo?
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Wait there everypony, i'll be back in one minute.
<MaxTheBrony> Im waiting xD
*MaxTheBrony is confused
<Polydunami> So would you consider The Princess Bride to be a B movie?
<otakon> um yes
<icybeauti> Polydunami: Yes
<MaxTheBrony> Is it?
<Ann> Well, Paranormial activity was pretty low budget, but fits in "A". And there's some pretty non-hipster B movies. Arthouse movies, on a whole, are very hipster, but they're disclouded.
<AdamTheDuck> Right it was ponyo. : S
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<pony_7384> Shazbot
<icybeauti> What about the pokemon movies? I was going to pool in the first one next week.
<Polydunami> Actually, yeah, it's a B movie. Cult classic and all.
<pony_7384> ;)
<Ann> It seems to be just public perception these days.
<otakon> B's
<otakon> ALL POKEMON MOVIES ARE B's
<otakon> PERIOD
<MaxTheBrony> True
<icybeauti> Okay Thank you.
<Polydunami> Possibly C.
<otakon> END OF DISCUSSION
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I think the pokemon movies are actually As
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: -____________-
<Meanwhile> Dat kick
<CriticKitten> lol
<Ann> Pulp Fiction was A at the time, but is considered "cult" and "hipster" now. *shrugs* who really knows.
<MaxTheBrony> All Anime except Spirited away and such is usally B movies :)
<icybeauti> My olest brother remembers seeing the first 2 in theatres.
<Dovah> how do you enter this lottery thing-a-ma-jig?
<otakon> MaxTheBrony: don't forget Princess Mononoke
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh look, in the list shizu posted someone put the first pokemon movie as a B and shizu corrected them that it is an A
<MaxTheBrony> otakon: I actually havent seen it D:
<Meanwhile> Dovah: Newsletter.
<otakon> Dovah: enter the newsletter, send a mod your email
<AdamTheDuck> Dovah: Sign up for the newsletter
<icybeauti> Dovah: Sign up for the newsletter, then after that, I have no idea
<otakon> MaxTheBrony: you should, good movie
<Dovah> I see
<MaxTheBrony> otakon: I will then :)
<Shizuka> 13it was a collaborative effort
<Meanwhile> icybeauti: The link to the lottery is in the newsletters. :P
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: bull how is Pokemon a A
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Shizuka
*icybeauti facehoof
<otakon> Shizuka: HOW is Pokemon a A?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: ask the mods
<spitfirecolt> hi shi hows everything going
<otakon> I am and hello spitfirecolt
<Meanwhile> otakon: an*
<otakon> WHATEVER!
<Rain> otakon, the budget behind it
<MaxTheBrony> Heya spitfirecolt
<spitfirecolt> hay guys
<Ann> if you're any fan of animation all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies are worth watching.
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<Ann> For the most part.
<otakon> it doesn't even have the animation quality to back that budget though.....
<MaxTheBrony> Exactly :D
<spitfirecolt> when is the documentary coming out
<Rain> otakon, the same way The Brave Little Toaster is an A
<Ann> When it's done I suppose.
<Rain> Ann, yus
<otakon> Rain: but that one is acutually GOOD
<Ann> So much flag stealing in this game.
<MaxTheBrony> YEr
<otakon> Rain: and not some damn pandering of pokemons to children
<Ann> Oh god, the hours spent as a child watching TBLT
<Polydunami> Okay, I'm going to head out now.
<otakon> Ann: TBLT?
<Kandarihu> I can't imagine a fandom overlap with the likes of Beavis & Butthead and Miyazaki.
<Ann> Later Ploy
<otakon> bye Polydunami take care!
<MaxTheBrony> Bye Polydunami
<Ann> The Brave Little Toaster
<Polydunami> I'm out for the entire evening so I'll see you guys tomorrow!
<Rain> otakon, tell me you didnt get teary eyed when as was turned to stone and pikachu was hopelessly trying to schock him back to life
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Otakon, why do you hates the pokeymans?
<MaxTheBrony> Aw you gonna miss the stream D:
<Polydunami> I'm out.
<Rain> and then I will believe you
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Polydunami
<cachi01> melons
<otakon> Rain: enope bc I KNEW it wasn't the end.
<spitfirecolt> i did rain i got tearyed eyed
<Ann> It's Scott Pilgrim is it not tonight?
<otakon> Rain: plus the very ending makes the movie pointless
<icybeauti> k I'm gonna check the EQD for any news on release date brb
<Meanwhile> Ann: That's next week.
<Ann> Hell, I cry for most sappy movie things >.<
<AdamTheDuck> Ann: No that's next week
<otakon> Ann: next week, you missed this weeks movies by about 5 hours
<Ann> Ah, thanks.
<cachi01> has anypony streamed IB?????
<otakon> Ann: the four minutes in UP
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: everyone knew it wasnt the end. Doesnt mean the emotion of the scene is lost.
<Alpha-Omega> and this is?
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: Brave Little Toaster had more emotion
<cachi01> Alpha-Omega: tribes ascend
<otakon> Alpha-Omega: it's Tribes: Ascend
<Meanwhile> Brave Little Toaster is best Toaster.
<icybeauti> Wait, season 3 is only getting 13 episodes :'(
<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: It did. Thats because toasters rule.
<Alpha-Omega> cool?
<otakon> dammit Meanwhile for once we agree on something.
<cachi01> Meanwhile: and woodentoaster?
<Ann> "Followed by something more" or soemthing to that accord.
<alexxm> night guys
<spitfirecolt> i love brave little toaster meanwhile
<Spectrum_Rush|> Meanwhile: would that be a B or A, i say A
<Meanwhile> cachi01: Catches fire.
<otakon> night alexxm sleep well
<Ann> Don't worry, 13 or not, they'll deliver.
<icybeauti> I know the brave little toaster, where was that from again?
<cachi01> Meanwhile: and the derpy decorative toaster cozy?
<otakon> icybeauti: Disney
<icybeauti> otakon: Now i remeber!
<Alpha-Omega> Downloading..now
<otakon> icybeauti: good movie
<Meanwhile> cachi01: Should never be spoken of again.
<spitfirecolt> say that on tv when it first came on
<icybeauti> Meanwhile: stay outta my shed...
<otakon> spitfirecolt: I think it was a actual theater release first
<Alpha-Omega> ...
<Ann> Fifel goes West was pretty awesome, while we're on the topic of old animated movies.
<Spectrum_Rush|> care with referances to .mov
<cachi01> shed outta my stay
<spitfirecolt> i think it was but i saw it on disney channel
<Spectrum_Rush|> *careful
<otakon> Ann: AMERICAN TALE MOST BE STREAMED HERE!
<Meanwhile> The sworders have our flag. >:I
<EspyLacopa> I wonder what would happen if you tossed The Doctor into the movie Independence Day.
<otakon> Must
<Panda> cachi01, Stay outta mah shed >:D
<Ann> I've always like "Goes West" better to be honest.\
<otakon> EspyLacopa: they'd win faster
<Ann> Fifel is best jewish family.
<otakon> Ann: well it's definitely more action packed but I like the first AT better, more emotion.
<spitfirecolt> fievel goes west was good but not as good as the first
<icybeauti> What about a disney movie like the lion king or even sleeping beuaty?
<otakon> icybeauti: yes to that too
<cachi01> i dont like disney tale movies
<otakon> we REALLY need a Disney week or something
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah otakon :D
<Ann> You know, that new Princess Frog was it, was actually suprisingly good.
<otakon> wait...Disney Tales?
<icybeauti> ^^^
<spitfirecolt> sleeping bueaty over lion king for me
<MaxTheBrony> Sounds awesome
<otakon> Ann: yes it was
<cachi01> the really alterate a lot i mean they are good but they are not showig the true story
<icybeauti> Ann Did you see tangled? I really enjoyed that one too.
<otakon> Also, Tangled was pretty good too
<MaxTheBrony> tangled was hilarious :)
<cachi01> tangled was meh
<Ann> I did, I was honestly suprised it was that good. I had low hopes but nope.
<Alpha-Omega> I just remembered why my itunes derps so much. I have 26 gb of stuff in there :P
<Spectrum_Rush|> otakon: more like a disney month... or 2
<Meanwhile> Dat shot.
<otakon> Alpha-Omega: lol time to clear it out
<MaxTheBrony> I dont like Itunes at all D:
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush|: yeah, recently I've been putting Beauty and the Beast on for my A
<Alpha-Omega> Noooooo it's all the my little pony episodes
<icybeauti> I think it's disney channel and the IRL movies that disney sucks on. The animation usually doesn't fail us. Remeber phineaus and ferb?
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<spitfirecolt> tangled was good but frog princess was better

<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: thankfully i managed to avoid dbz, despite being surrounded for all the hype for it. even as a little kid i somehow was bored to hell with it, when i rewatched it as an adult i understand why
<icybeauti> I was too young for those, gotta check em out
<Ann> Well Disney's buisness profile has changed.
<StoryLine> Pixar is the new disney
<MaxTheBrony> Sumica: Is there any limits how many times i can be kicked? i have been kick 117 times so far :) by writing to fast
<cachi01> mulan. the movie that shows you that being a travesti is fine
<Fisheh_Fish> I will be honest though, I never really got into Cinderella
<Ann> Most shows now don't suck, there's just a lot of shovelware out there so to speak. Also many of us wear our nostalga glasses way too much.
<Sumica> 00,10it's not just your kicks MaxTheBrony
<Fisheh_Fish> Lol true dat cachi01
<owloysius|skyrim> MaxTheBrony: no, sumica kicked somepony 117 times

<cachi01> sumica AAAAAAAAH savior of bronystate!
<StoryLine> Blue Ranger ftw
<Zanon> sadly i was to old when power rangers was the thing
<Ann> Most still do, but so did they back then. It just happened to be the Cartoon Renessence [spelling]. We lucked out with our generational timing.
<cachi01> GO GO POWER RANGERS
<Fisheh_Fish> icybeauti: Now that brings back memories of sitting infront of the TV on Saturday mornings
<Alpha-Omega> I wasn't :3

<Fisheh_Fish> My parents wouldn't let me lie about my age so I could play Runescape
<MaxTheBrony> Tribes
<Fisheh_Fish> :(
<Sumica> 00,10and wrek found out the hard way that was a lasor designator
<cachi01> Alpha-Omega: i hope you make lotsaspaghetti!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Ah ok lol
<Rarityisboss> Hello everypony
<Zanon> cow and chicken
<icybeauti> I can't imagine. Just a few years ago, not having a computer was no big deal. Now you're Amish without one.
<Alpha-Omega> I always do

<turtlegod98> courage the cowardly dog was alright.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Hai Rarity :D
<Ann> Oh god, no more sketties >.< I made too much and had to eat it for a week. Don't get me wrong it was epic, but just too much.

<Fisheh_Fish> Lion King made me want to go to Africa
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Rarityisboss
<icybeauti> Mine was a bunch of pokemon episodes we got from a japanese friend.
<StoryLine> Lion King
<Ann> While visting my uncles's place I tried to play Lion King for my son on VHS, but he got upset when a DVD wasn't in the case, he just didn't understand. :p
<cachi01> hi applejack096
<Underpony> Hi applejack096

<MaxTheBrony> Haha I remember going to the library playing Runescape after school xD
<Fisheh_Fish> I remember when my library had movies... Good times
<XAX> I wish they would produce a Pokemon anime following the story of the Manga.
<Alpha-Omega> Simba in swahili means lion
<turtlegod98> I gave my vhs to my nephew...BIG mistake.

<StoryLine> Remember Blockbuster and renting a game because you were to poor to own a game
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<icybeauti> Remeber razor scooters.
<Ann> I miss movie rental places, mostly because renting a game was cheaper then dropping 60 dollars.
<Rarityisboss> I'm waching it right now
<Fisheh_Fish> I remember going with my mom to check out the Lost World, and watching it with my stuffed animals :)
<Ann> Oh, you beat me to it Storyline

<Underpony> Rarity is nice
<Sumica> 00,10Dont mass ping please applejack096
<SuperBrony64> 11,02applejack096: Hey, please don't do mass pings, thanks :)
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: yes
<Ann> or is that 12?
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: i heard it was incredibly linear
<Saturn> 08,01applejack096: don't mass ping or i'll eat you
<StoryLine> I like Rarity. one of the top ponies
<MaxTheBrony> Oh lordy :3
<Fisheh_Fish> I remember playing Duke Nukem 3D
<Ann> Well of course FF's are linear!
<Ann> It's a JRPG.
<Fisheh_Fish> Well after it came out, though
<Rarityisboss> :(
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: FFXIII is cool but FFXIII-2 IT RAPES YOUR FUCKING MIND
<twilight_sprinkle> Ann: i suppose to some degree yeah
<Saturn> 08,01omnomnom
<MaxTheBrony> I remember i played Sc1 with my friends Coop ^^
<Rarityisboss> :[
<StoryLine> Ann you are so right
<MaxTheBrony> on the same computer
<applejack096> Ok gys :) Didnt know it was one of the rules. Sorry my bad :)
<Underpony> Applejack/Twilight > Rarity/Pinkie > Futtershy/Rainbow
<Alpha-Omega> so superBrony and Violet like derpy too....SWEET
<Underpony> (but that's just like my opinion man)
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: yeah lol i got that impression after watching Jon Trons parody of it
<icybeauti> Only one of you mods like Rarity :(
<Ann> It's been a while since I've played a good JRPG though. I miss epic sprawling stories. Those kind of storylines that you go to bed thinking about.
<Rarityisboss> you guys ever heard of team fortress 2
<MaxTheBrony> O:o
<MaxTheBrony> Nope
<MaxTheBrony> what is that?
<Alpha-Omega> no
<cachi01> Rarityisboss: oh yeah that cod ripoff
<Ann> TF2 = so much god damned win.
<Meanwhile> >Good JRPG
<Meanwhile> lol no
<Underpony> [00:54:49]* #bronystate :Cannot send to channel - Message blocked due to repeating (+K set) ?
<icybeauti> fluttershy is always the fave....
<Alpha-Omega> It's too violet for me
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<StoryLine> I own FFXIII and XIII-2 and think they are "good" games. But they suck in FF srandard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Go Wrek.
<Rarityisboss> you know why Rarity is my favorite?
<Fisheh_Fish> Why?
<applejack096> Who is streamng this?
<Underpony> Why?
<Ann> What makes them bad anyhow? I never played them, but I'm just wondering.
<Rarityisboss> because in tf2 shes the spy
<Underpony> oh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rarityisboss: Do you want to be a maid?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Ann> God... damn... spies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01^
<Fisheh_Fish> Spies...
<Ann> Almost as bad as the bloody snipers...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01^
<Meanwhile> I never really was on your side.
<MaxTheBrony> Allegro and giga where are you D: Damn swedish time
<Alpha-Omega> :S
<Underpony> I never played TF2
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<MaxTheBrony> try it
<Meanwhile> And here's a touchin' story, once upon a time you died. And I lived happily ever after.
<Ann> Though when the sniper and spy pack came out and all the noobs were playing them, it boosted my ego so much. <Pyro player.
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<Spectrum_Rush|> MaxTheBrony: in less than 40 mins
<Fisheh_Fish> I'mma go watch me some Regular Ordinary Swedish Meal Time
<Zanon> ive been a maid
<Zanon> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/174/0/b/zanon__the_lusty_pony_maid_by_kohtiko-d54kj0n.png
<Underpony> I don't like multiplayer in general
<Rarityisboss> hi MaxTheBrony
<Zanon> anything else?
<MaxTheBrony> Spectrum_Rush|: ah thanks :D
<Meanwhile> Ann: And then suddenly, someone who knows what they're doing.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Rarityisboss :)
<Ann> TF2 is one of those games that I keep coming back to.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Zanon: Nice.
<Ann> Yeah, then you get raped...
<StoryLine> Ann: the story is to upbeat for a FF game
<PinkiePieYoshi64> GIANT FOREST MAP FTW!
*MaxTheBrony feels somehwat suspicious now
<twilight_sprinkle> so this game is like a giant hl2-engine surf map?
<Ann> Ah, fair enough.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Reminds me of Endor...
<Ann> I can't play a sniper or spy to save my damn life.
<Rarityisboss> hey guys have you waching th olmpyics
<Underpony> no
<Underpony> I haven't
<Rarityisboss> oh

<twilight_sprinkle> Rarityisboss: i havent been following much besides the tennis
<cachi01> Ann: they were awesome
<Meanwhile> So, Pinkie Pie is the best pony. Glad we all agree.

<cachi01> Meanwhile: eeyup
<MaxTheBrony> Rowan Attikson
<Underpony> Meanwhile, no Applejack
<Ann> I'm a bigger fan of the winter olympics, being Canadian I suppose that makes snese.
<MaxTheBrony> or somewhat
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Underpony> >:(
<Ann> I've heard they were good. I'm looking forward to it.
<cachi01> Underpony: lol silly underpony you mispelled pinkie pie

<applejack096> Bai everypony
<icybeauti> was watching MASS KILLING TIME!
<cachi01> bye applejack096!
<StoryLine> Ann: I still like it but don't expect a normal FF game. The Music is so amazing though. I dare say it competes with FF7 music wise
<twilight_sprinkle> Rarityisboss: yeah theyve been out for a while (and not allowed to talk about them here btw)
<Ann> Applejack gets a boost in my books only because of the episode where she was sleep fucked.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye applejack096
<cachi01> Spectrum_Rush|: luna is best princess
<Underpony> Ann: whut
<applejack096> Byeeeee :) ;)
<Allegr0> Rarityisboss I've got a spoiler for you! Ponies will face conflict, followed by resolution!
<Ann> I really should play it, but having a PS3 that isn't backward compatible makes it hard.
<StoryLine> I heart AppleJack
<twilight_sprinkle> Allegr0: woah.
<Allegr0> Rarityisboss don't tell anyone :P
<Rarityisboss> kk

<cachi01> Ann: i cant play ps2 games but i can play ps1 games O_o
<Ann> Applebucking Season or something. Whatever that episode is. If you've ever been sleep deprived it's a very fair and accurate depiction.
<Rarityisboss> Swag
<Underpony> I heard that in Season 3, Snape kills Celestia.
<Rarityisboss> snape?
<Ann> o.O Spoilers!
<Meanwhile> People really need to read the rules page before actually loading chat up...

<Ann> It also has something to do with how they release it to other countries.
<Kandarihu> Hasbro isn't finished, just not doing well.
<Spectrum_Rush|> XAX: Studio B and DHX are one in the same
<Sumica> 00,10keep in mind the only thing confermed was that the other studio is making 13 eps
<Buytoast> Oi, you gotta let the show die at some point.
<icybeauti> I HAVE PUDDING!
<DoctoDoctorWho> we need at least 8 seasons b4 bronies will be satisfied
<Cypresswolf> There will be more seasons of Ponies - Hasbro isn't going to shoot their golden goose before their top show has reached its peak
<Rain> exactly what Sumica said
<Buytoast> or else it'll be the simpsons v.2
<Fisheh_Fish> Preach it DoctoDoctorWho
<Spectrum_Rush|> XAX: theres another studio though
<Wrek> 05another kick to the ocunter
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> theres obviously not going to be a movie
<Ann> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/07/william-andersons-poem-on-seasons.html Related to some extent. *shrugs*
<turtlegod98> http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/10351192.jpg my reaction to 13 episode season.
<Wrek> 05useing the spoiler alert tag
<Sumica> 00,10they have not confermed even slighly that s3 is only 13 eps
<Cypresswolf> I'd go to see that movie - Many Many times!
<Rarityisboss> I cant beleive 13 episodes
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<MaxTheBrony> We are
<Rain> exactly what Sumica said
<MaxTheBrony> Appricating it
<Ann> Jokes people, all jokes.
*Chrysalis trollface.jpg

<Fisheh_Fish> God, huge cramp in my neck :(
<Spectrum_Rush|> GigabitHarmonie silly i was keeding
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: yeah, i hate myself too. i suck :I
<Ann> It's printing Hasbro money, I think it's pretty safe to say ponies are not going anywhere.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Ghosties
<pony_8556> Why would they kill their only cash cow
<Rarityisboss> they should make a mlp fim movie

<MaxTheBrony> Colt stream :D
<Cypresswolf> :O the quality of ponies in a movie? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/910/
<Kencolt> One aspect is that this IS making the "Magic 65 episodes". SO, no less than any other animated series to be a success.
<Bronysith> Whom is streaming right now? i could help out
<Ann> Honestly I fear they'll keep ponies going until their dead. I have no fear of them going anywhere.

<Rarityisboss> I'm the boss
<JESmith71> Well remember that cryptic message William Anderson said about they're being more seasons coming. I bet Season 3 having only 13 episodes is so they can hurry up and reach the 65 episode mark so FiM can be syndicated already
<fluffle> Unless they are black apparently
<Fisheh_Fish> Hi
<Meanwhile> Did he say "hi weird teapots" ?

<Fisheh_Fish> I was like "Bitch please"
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<DrSteveSCARz> Ann: You dont need one
<slaughtershy> later
<DrSteveSCARz> Ann: Its honestly pointless
<slaughtershy> :[
<Ann> I don't have a cellphone either, darkages I am. Though I agree with you guys, it's pretty unnecessary. Social media driven society though.
<MaxTheBrony> Its catchy
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Fisheh_Fish> ^
<DrSteveSCARz> Makin me tap my foot
<Fou_Lou> Ann: i dont have a real use for a cellphone too. but i ahve one
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<slaughtershy> ahh crap its in my mind!!
<Fisheh_Fish> My cell phone is for rape emergencies only
<Barbetos> Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie did either of you play Star War TOR? How did you feel about if you did?
<Dken2021> Ann same with ya, but I kinds need one to know if I got a job or not
<onetonsackoffun> pills here
<Ann> Honestly I don't want one. When I'm outta the house I want to be left alone! Though, ya I hear you Fou_Lou, there's a lot of pressure for people to have one now.
<Thrackerzod> Have you played any of the poni flash games recently, like adventure pony
<Fisheh_Fish> Thrackerzod: Where would you find them?
<Thrackerzod> google^
<Ann> @Dken, yeah work wanted me to get one too, I hear you. Though got rid of it at 2 months.
<Fisheh_Fish> Seems legit
<onetonsackoffun> derp
<Ann> MMORPG = all MMORPG
<MaxTheBrony> Allegr0 or GigabitHarmonie Do any of you have DeviantArt ( im not sure if i asked this before , just ignore this if i did :) )
<Buytoast> WoW will never die.
<Buytoast> Pandaland will revive it.
<Buytoast> You'll see.
<Fou_Lou> Ann: its not bad when youre in a region with bad internet and stuff. I usally use mine when im at visit at home. Its a little village so bad internet and stuff
<Fisheh_Fish> "You ded"
<Fou_Lou> Ann: and im not buying a new one unless my old one stops working because its a nokia 3310 ^^
<Ann> @Fou_Lou Fair enough. Internet here is pretty good. I've little need for one.
<onetonsackoffun> derp derp derp
<Ann> old Nokia = indestructible.
<Dovah> Fact: Allegr0 hates pressing the on button on his 360.
<Ann> Music is art!
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<Fisheh_Fish> ^^
<MaxTheBrony> Exactly
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<MaxTheBrony> +1 Ann
<onetonsackoffun> being funny is a art
<Fou_Lou> Ann: same here. Im either at home. Having internet. Or at work. Having internet too. Or somewhere out or going from to work. so no need for a cellphone
<Barbetos> Allegr0 lol You pretty much summed up how people felt about SWTOR I think. I dunno if I am ready to get into GW2 though, so many MMO's have let me down in the past. =\
<slaughtershy> forevar
<Fisheh_Fish> Dem impressions
<onetonsackoffun> purple but fun
<DrSteveSCARz> :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> o_o
<Thrackerzod> scary but fun
<cratorkid> Allegr0: and GigabitHarmonie do you know any languages? if you could learn any other language ( fictional or factual) what would it be?
<AttacktheAndalite> Aaaah my fucking glasses
<Ann> @ Fou_Lou Honestly I enjoy being detached when I go out. Being able to be "unreachable" is nice. That way you don't have people saying "Well you have a CP take it with you!"
<MaxTheBrony> Swedish Ofc :D
<Dovah> Allegr0: LIES!!!!!
<Fisheh_Fish> I'm asking this cuz I don't wanna feel like a pussy, but am I the only one that was too scared to finish Amnesia?
<LonelyCanary> Nope.
<Ann> God, stream or LoL?
<MaxTheBrony> Nope me 2
<MaxTheBrony> ^^
<LonelyCanary> Ex boyfriend couldnt finish it.
<Fisheh_Fish> Oh, good. That makes me feel much better
<onetonsackoffun> purple but fun
<Fou_Lou> Ann: its nice to have one for emergency situations. Even if you have one you can still turn it off.
<AttacktheAndalite> Hai LonelyCanary
<Ann> That is true Fou. I want one for my car because I commute 6 hours every weekend.
<LonelyCanary> Hihi AttacktheAndalite
<Fisheh_Fish> hai vinyl
<Dken2021> lali-ho Canary
<Ann> Just a pay and talk is fine I think.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey LonelyCanary
<Fou_Lou> programming languages doesnt count
<Ann> Haha, language = programming language.
<CriticKitten> Hai Canary. Am playing Basara right now. :3
<onetonsackoffun> i know a lot of english
<String_Shredder> What is the worst Video Game movie?
<Fisheh_Fish> onetonsackoffun: So do I, but it comes from living here
<owloysius> but can you write a for loop in malbolge?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)

<Dovah> aha! that was a fluttershy!
<Fou_Lou> if those count mathmatics is a language too
<MaxTheBrony> GigabitHarmonie Allegr0 would you guys play LoL with us in a future stream?
<Thrackerzod> I'm pretty sure i can program GW2 at this pont just because my girlfreind wont stop talking about it, as i type this message im getting my inbox filled
<Barbetos> Gigabitharmonie I learned to write the japanese alphabet and I want to say it helped me to acutally feel confident in my drawing. It might work for you too if you want to get good at drawing?
<DrSteveSCARz> Have you guys played Slender?
<Dken2021> String_Shredder spirits within of course, nothing final fantasy about it
<onetonsackoffun> i live on mars

<MaxTheBrony> Ofcourse we understand :)
<MaxTheBrony> we are Bronies
<Fou_Lou> whos talking in the stream again?
<Ann> You know, I don't think there are any other fandoms out there with this much community. You don't see Transformers fans running streams and LoL community plays. It's always impressive.
<onetonsackoffun> this could not go wrong
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so hows everypony doing?
<Fisheh_Fish> What's LoL?
<Bronysith> Fisheh_Fish: league of legends

<SlenderPony> A lot to explore in the forest
<Derpy_Hooves> Allegr0: they split the sequel into parts, part 1 is out atm, its called "I Wanna Be The Guy: Gaiden"

<cachi01> Derpy_Hooves: THERE IS A FUCKING SEQUEL? OMGOMGOGMOMGOMGOM
<Ghosties> 04The only medium that it's surviving on is PC
<Ghosties> 04On consoles, survival horror is dying and/or dead
<Reikim> ^
<Derpy_Hooves> cachi01: ja its been out for a couple of weeks
<Dken2021> resident evil's gone the action route
<Jmo4267> Amnesia <3
<kirzstryfe> GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0
<Ghosties> 04But on the PC, holy shit, survival horror is alive and well
<cachi01> OMFG
<cachi01> GOING TO DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT NOW
<Derpy_Hooves> cachi01: hard as fuck
<Derpy_Hooves> like 3 times harder
<SlenderPony> Download slender while you are at it

*LadyCanary flies over to JarlBaconTheGreater and nestles in his mane
<Reikim> Yeah, I finally bothered to go check main page >.>
<Supersaga> lol no SlenderPony
<Reikim> I'd support this
<Ghosties> 04>Resident Evil 6 horror
<cachi01> but the fucking 8 notes are impossible
<JarlBaconTheGreater> 0,5ohai LC
<Ghosties> 04>implying it will be horror
<cachi01> resident evil 6 is fun and itss awesome
<cachi01> e
<RAWRity> Minecraft is amazing
<cachi01> Ghosties: leon campaign is terror based
<SlenderPony> Who wants to brohoof my 8 feet long legs? =======================/)
<Wrek> 05i wouldnt call slender a game
<Wrek> 05i would call it a test
<Reikim> There's also that SCP Foundation game. Pretty darn scary.
<Shooeie> Discord vs Loki who would win in a game of choas?
<Ghosties> 04Cry of Fear
<Ghosties> 04Cry o' Fear
<cachi01> Shooeie: q
<Epalant> slender is awesome
<RAWRity> Shooeie: Loki
<Ghosties> 04Like seriously, that game is awesome
<Wrek> 05Epalant: its boring
<HungryForChicken> DEAD SPACE
<Derpy_Hooves> Allegr0: what were your opinion on the "Fatal Frame" series :3
<Supersaga> yes Epalant
<HungryForChicken> DEAD SPACE
<Ghosties> 04In fact, the Swedish people are brilliant at horror
<Epalant> @Wrek i believe you are mistaking sir
<Reikim> The thing is, horror games don't sell as well. They're too...artsy. Thoughtful. They're not multiplayre gun-fests like, say CoD>
<superretroworld> anybody hear about drake bell becoming a brony?
<Epalant> yes i know supersaga
<Ghosties> 04YES
<Derpy_Hooves> cachi01: did you find it?
<Ghosties> 04Scratches is AMAZING
<Jmo4267> Scratches, that's Steam isn't it?
<Ghosties> 04It's a point and click adventure game
<Supersaga> Drake Bell Became a Brony?
<Reikim> Takes too much writing acumen to create a good horror game, and most developers aren't willing to invest that much in their writing team...
<Ghosties> 04But the atmosphere is truly awe-inspiring
<Biglaw> Allegr0 Ever watched Adventure Time?
<DrSteveSCARz> Steam Names?
