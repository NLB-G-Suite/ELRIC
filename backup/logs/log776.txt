<twilight_sprinkle> cause "should of", tehlonpon
<AJIsAwesome> Invi: Probably the second one. :D

<Spamish2> Mute me :P
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Saturn> 08,01huh, i got the command the wrong way round
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I'm not implying that I want to, but what do you mean? You mean /ignore?
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm going to guess by the distinct lack of picture on the stream that there is no stream?
<wipergone2> Saturn: hi
<thelonepony> so, =madri is a whole chat mute?
<thelonepony> +*
<Invi> AJIsAwesome, nah. i think to mute 1 person for the whole chatroom
<AJIsAwesome> weeping_pegasi82: Wrek's getting things set up again. :)
<Canebridge> Refresh!
<weeping_pegasi82> ah, thanks
<Spamish2> Stream is back, maybye.
<Canebridge> Refresh for adjusting madness
<Invi> oh stream is back
<thelonepony> ha
<AJIsAwesome> So basically we can't see what messages they're posting?
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<Wrek> 05stream workign or the vid gittering?
<Saturn> 08,01like a selective +m
<Spamish2> Finally :)
<Invi> but the pic is weird
<Canebridge> Right side of video is a bit odd
<weeping_pegasi82> Wrek: sort of gittering
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not sure if I like that or not.... :S
<Saturn> 08,01it's by hostmask too, so i coudl theoretically silence a whole ISP
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: you could say its bot
<Saturn> 08,01not that i would
<thelonepony> both*
<Rose`> meow?
<Wrek> 05better?

<SirGanjalf> ah Samurai Jack, to bad i can't stay right now:(
<HavokOC> Oooh
<HavokOC> Sweet
<Saturn> 08,01explanation by example
<Kandarihu> Saturn, would it affect people on a targetted ISP with Vhosts enabled?
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: i'd have to use the vhost as the hsotmask
<thelonepony> all of those come and go wers
<Kandarihu> Saturn, I see. This should still be useful against people who change nicks for the sake of spamming.
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: well, not really; i'd jsut ban them
<Wrek> 05there goes!
<Wrek> 05hit play
<Saturn> 08,01on the same hostmask i'd use to +q them
<Rose`> much bettar
<Rose`> whats +q?
<Saturn> 08,01that.
<thelonepony> mute on selectyer person
<Spamish2> It's ok now

<Rose`> didnt do anything
<twilight_sprinkle> +q is k-line right?
<Saturn> 08,01yes it did
<prince-dari> Lol, no twilight_sprinkle
<Saturn> 08,01k-line is a server ban
<twilight_sprinkle> o, +q is mute then?
<Saturn> 08,01so if you try and even get onto the server, you get booted
*Kandarihu missed the whole episode because he meant to have Firefox closed out until the virus scan finishes, but oh well.

<thelonepony> ah
<wipergone2> evil is dead
<Pinkies_imagination> gah.... I hate editing my first fic... Every time I try it takes forever... and all I can think is... wow.... I used to be THAT bad at grammar?
<VenHur> Nope, somewhere around 2007, the TMNT CGI movie was the last of his work before cancer got the best of him.
<thelonepony> Pinkies_imagination: know that feel, but i dont write fanfics :D
<wipergone2> VenHur: evil is dead
<Kipkat07_USAF> I learned that shaving with a straight razor is a bad idea if youre just starting to shave O__O
<wipergone2> y
<thelonepony> Kipkat07_USAF: you could cut an artery?
<VenHur> I know, which is why i'm not used to making fictions, you see, the secret of making fictions so popular is how innovative it is, something that the public never seen before.
<VenHur> Originality and innovation are what makes fictions so special about them.
<Kipkat07_USAF> I have a neckbeard so it was highly likely. Thats why I alway keep a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a few gauze patches on hand when I shave
<VenHur> You just gotta' put some brains into the olde noggin.
<Kipkat07_USAF> Dear Princess Celestia, I learned that humans have quite a lot of blood
<wipergone2> lol
<Kipkat07_USAF> but I did get cut 3 times and once was on the neck :'(

<Dark_Horst> this is the one thing missing in gaming
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: that's a bit gory for posting in here
<Punkie_Pue> I dont think modern materials for bow string would allow that.
<Saturn> 08,01but i'll let you off this *one* time because it was hilarious
<butler> whats with the links? its illegal on this site, right?
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: Serious Sam and Painkiller come close XD

<Punkie_Pue> BladedWings: Glad you like it. Im surprised it only has 1100 views
<BladedWings> Saturn: lol
<Punkie_Pue> BladedWings: Certainly underrated
<Dark_Horst> animators.sometimes i wonder about them
<Engi> >9gag
<Engi> get out
<Dark_Horst> Engi: or you shut up
<fillyfillyy> OMG!! My boyfriend just told me that he might get to compete in the 2016 olympic games!!
<Dark_Horst> i dont give a shit where it'S posted. it's funny. that's what i give a shit about. why dont you?
<Dark_Horst> seriously, gie me a good rason
<BladedWings> fillyfillyy: wow, good luck to him ^_^
<Punkie_Pue> Dark_Horst: Thats funny
<Saturn> 08,01heh, spot the redditor
<Shizuka> 13LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: dude, HTTP 420
<Saturn> 08,01evenin' pony_7158
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: hm?
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: enhance your calm.
<Dark_Horst> i am calm?
<Dark_Horst> wait
<Dark_Horst> you confuse me
<Saturn> 08,01Engi was just making a joke, i'm sure
<Saturn> 08,01don't go off on one about it
<Dark_Horst> im afraid he wasnt
<Saturn> 08,01well, pretend he was, then
<Saturn> 08,01he's not said anything further about it
<Engi> She expressed some disdain for your taste in recycled and watermarked images, is all
<Dark_Horst> thing is, happens everytime. as soon as there's 9gag in the url, somebody starts btiching. and as of yet, nobody managed to explain to me why
<Saturn> 08,01well, 9gag is kinda shit
<Shizuka> 13LE LE LE LE LE LE LE LE
<Shizuka> 13LE ME LE STREAMING SOON
<Saturn> 08,01for the reasons Engi said
<Dark_Horst> Engi: so why give a shit where it's been and not been? why care?
<Saturn> 08,01recycled imaged, watermarked, no real original content, horrible userbase, basically 9gag is the new ebaumsworld
<Engi> because they claim it as their own
<Dark_Horst> couldnt care less
<Dark_Horst> i never read the comments anyway
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: look up and listen to the song Ebaumsworld.com by Trapezoid (Lemon Demon)
<Dark_Horst> i go there, browse, find amusing stuff, done
<AdamTheDuck> browniestaet stahp
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: they basically steal content to make ad revenue
<Saturn> 08,01that's kinda shitty
<AdamTheDuck> Enjoy some awesomeness instead ;~; http://fav.me/d5j72lh
<Saturn> 08,01and, of course, because they're re-encoding, it's shitter quality too
<Dark_Horst> then tell me where it comes from so i can look there
<Engi> 4chan and reddit both produce deent amounts of OC
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: that's the thing; often you can't tell. one way to find out is to use google image matching
<Engi> *decent
<Saturn> 08,01drag the image onto google image search and try and find that
<Dark_Horst> stolen content or not, it's easy to browse and appearantly collects form multiple sources into one adress
<Dark_Horst> easy access
<Saturn> 08,01linking the original is preferrable if you can find it
<Shizuka> 13oh fmle...
<alexxm|foal> ok Saturn what about funny junk
<Dark_Horst> and the content is fun anyway
<Shizuka> 13why you suck so much...
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm|foal: funnyjunk can suck mine
<Shizuka> 13anyway you can hit play now
<Dark_Horst> been on funnyjunk. not that funny
*Saturn 08,01hits play; breaks computer
<Saturn> 08,01funny junk isn't actually all that bad; they pay for and create original content
<Shizuka> 13let me know when everyone sees fire
<Punkie_Pue> I see the fire
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i see fire!
<Punkie_Pue> Its needs to be hotter though.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Computer is on fire, wut do?
<Saturn> 08,01SuperBrony64: buy marshmallows
<Dark_Horst> well, i could go to 4chan, but msot of that stuff is reposts too nowadays
*AdamTheDuck passes the marshmallows around :3
<Dark_Horst> also, i'd have to go through tons of crap before i find somehting funny
<SpeccyRush> SuperBrony64: hit f4 backspace
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Saturn: Is marshmallows compatible with my OS?
<Punkie_Pue> Haha
<Dark_Horst> let the 9gaggers do the sorting for me

<CCharmanderK> The only thing childish about her is her face and height.
<Polydunami> Oh, YOUR country
<CCharmanderK> She's got massive knockers, though.
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: YOU'RE A WIZARD PRIME MINISTER

<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> Shizuka: werent there shorts on Haruhi? i remember a cooking one that make me rofl
<CCharmanderK> Yes, Haruhi-chan Suzumiya!!
<DocSane> Beware of the moe blob. She skips and cries...
<cachi01> Fan yourself.
<CCharmanderK> Beware of the moe blob. She's a manipulative bitch.
<Shizuka> 13cachi01: You should know better than to discuss rule 34 here.
<cachi01> yeah i keep forgettin that :I
<cachi01> sowwy
<Shizuka> 13You had better remember.
<twilight_squirtle> called it
<Major> Hearing that book ttitle makes me want to read "To Kill a Mocking Bird"
<Buytoast> esper?
<Buytoast> that a ghost spider?
<Shizuka> 13psychic
<DocSane> ESPer
<Buytoast> ah
<Shizuka> 13^
<cachi01> twilight_squirtle, Sketch_Torkoal_Brony, CCharmanderK y so poke?
<Buytoast> sounds like some kind of phantom arachnid
<Polydunami> Dang it, why didn't I see that? ESPer -_(\
<CCharmanderK> "Koizumi, is there something you wanna tell me?" "Yes, it's as you've guessed... I'm gay." "Actually I'm talking about how you're an esper." "Oh yeah, that too."
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> cachi01: lol idk :3 the others might
<Cypresswolf> Hello Everypony :)
<twilight_squirtle> cachi01: long story, it began from discussing what +q is, then what the q stands for, then we started sayign words with q, then adding q's to words, then i became squirtle
<DocSane> ESPer is a very old sci-fi term. It fell out of use nearly everywhere except in Japan.
<Polydunami> Hey there, Cypresswolf
<Shizuka> 13so... haruhi is inception
<Shizuka> 13BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRM
<BladedWings> hi Cypresswolf
<Polydunami> God knows
<Major> So I might be able to get a latptop next week :3
<alexxm|foal> how've you been Cypresswolf
<CCharmanderK> Esper has actually come back into use thanks to Haruhi Suzumiya.
<Buytoast> so the lean mean grope machine is some sort of godlike reality bender?
<DocSane> Haruhi is the differentiated ideoblast. (And you get bonus points is you get that reference).
<cachi01> Polydunami: i see what you did there
<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> Shizuka: :D now im remembering that chocolate-ception from spongebob
<Cypresswolf> What sorts of shenanigans have I miss out on todya? :)
<Buytoast> this show keeps getting more twists than a bread bag tie
<Shizuka> 13it gets worse :3
<pony_9401> ^
<Major> Shizuka: Yay~?
<Polydunami> Just you wait
<CCharmanderK> Wait until the next episode.
<Shizuka> 13the crazy gets turned up to 12

<Sketch_Torkoal_Brony> :D cant wait
<Polydunami> Only 12?
<pony_9401> O-o\
<CCharmanderK> I shall say nothing else.
<Major> Shizuka: Yay
<Cypresswolf> :) I like crazy
<Major> ~
<Buytoast> let me guess, it's only at 3 or something now
<cachi01> btw what was the episode where the world is invaded wit aliens but only haruhi and the boy i cant remember his name are on that world and shit happens?
<DocSane> Haruhi is a fickle god who doesn't realize that she's a god.
<pony_9401> 12 of them?
<CCharmanderK> She's not a God.
<pony_9401> Let the torture begin.
<Polydunami> Third chronologically, Buytoast, yes.

<CCharmanderK> Malmortius: She's cycling between this, Haruhi, Rozen and Spongbob. Cool your tits.
<Malmortius> Fine fine.
<Amu-chan> Nothing much. Just disappointed that my made up simulation hockey league which took an insane amount of preparation for this year is all set and has actually started pre-season, and the NHL and the NHLPA still hasn't managed to come to a deal to end the lockout yet. >->

<sonicdude558> lol crap on u
<Justin> This is the highlight of my day.
<GilDash> Cypresswolf: Yeah, I'm currently sleeping in a room with plaster dust on the floor.
<Kimori> is the lockout supposed to be because of wages again?
<Saturn> 08,01my boyfriend is being an arse
<Saturn> 08,01wait
<GilDash> Cypresswolf: The walls won't be painted for another week and fuck knows when the carpet's arriving. XD

<Saturn> 08,01CARRY ON, BRONSTATE
<LadyCanary> Sorry to hear that Saturn
<LadyCanary> <3
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #638
<Cypresswolf> GilDash: living on a jobsite? I've been there before :P - be thankful the roof over tour head is stable, this house is practically falling apart - Roof replacement is 1st on the list
<GilDash> Cypresswolf: This is the third time in as many years.
<Amu-chan> Yeah, pretty much.
<Cypresswolf> Kana is choking! Don't everyone get up all at once
<Rose`> why are they all angels
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol its always wages.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 5-10 million isn't enough.
<sonicdude558> ikr
<Cypresswolf> GilDash: I dont have a backup place to stay yet, have been offered to move back in with my parent til the renovation is done, but like to move to Galveston - can't take my cats with me, if I want to rent out their house there
<Afflict> you're right, it isn't
<GilDash> Cypresswolf: I'm living with parents, so I don't even have that choice. I've been without a room for 10 months now. XD
<Cypresswolf> GilDash: Roughing it?
<Saturn> 08,01i live in the largest room in my parents' house
<sonicdude558> your mom has a nice house
<sonicdude558> :P
<Saturn> 08,01unfortunately, before i moved back in with them, they were using the room as a storeroom
<Saturn> 08,01and have nowhere else to put that stuff in
<GilDash> Cypresswolf: Aye. Was living on a blow up air bed for that time. Went through 3 of them.
<Saturn> 08,01i literally don't have the space to walk from the door to my bed
<Shizuka> 13looks like someone fireballed an oblivion house there
<Vordox> Saturn: You got along with your parents?
<Saturn> 08,01i need to jump over a pedastel table to get into bed
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: not really, no
<Kimori> Reminds me of Hostess
<Saturn> 08,01but it's my only option to afford going to uni
<Cypresswolf> GilDash: that give me an idea - never thought of camping :) - I could live in the old trailer for awhile, I could stay here and work on the house in the meantime
<Kimori> I like twinkies :P
<Nittany_Discord> I had to move back in with my grandmother after college.
<Westly> Shizuka: yes the pshysics in oblivion are amazing in that way
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/WOW-Hostess-Twinkies-10-Count-Box-Golden-Sponge-Cake-with-Creamy-Filling-SHIPPED-/321030147372?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4abee34d2c
<GilDash> Cypresswolf: Yeah, camping out here isn't really an option. I honestly could sleep on the hard wooden floor if needed. As long as I've got a sleeping bag and are sleeping somewhere sensible I'm fine.
<Shizuka> 13rakka's story is starting to kick in btw
<Kimori> I probably would do the same thing this guy is doing right now
<Afflict> I've actually never had a twinkie before
<Cypresswolf> GilDash: I could sleep pretty much anywhere - I've slept in worse places - ever go on a cave tour where you go in so far, you have to sleep in and climb out the next morning?
<pony_364627> so y do u all like ponies so much?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I hate ponies >_>
<Kimori> I wanted to get some when I heard on the news the company was closing up
<GilDash> Cypresswolf: No. 'Cause I'm not that kind of crazy. :p

<Afflict> oh
<MLP_Brovakiin> pony_364627: I was about to ask you the very same question.
<Kimori> Couldnt get a twinkie :/

<Kimori> I'm pretty sure the workers arent happy
<pony_364627> MLP_Brovakiin: because i dont understand
<pony_364627> its a girls show
<Kimori> Most of em agreed to not get raises

<Kimori> they went on strike and now everyone loses
<MLP_Brovakiin> pony_364627: Not strictly true
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Cypresswolf> GilDash: its not so bad, if you can over look the fact no sleeping bag provides any comfort when sleeping on flat hard stone
<Yahooz> pony_364627: completely agree
<Polydunami> It's quite accessible for a girls' show, laddie
<Yahooz> summed up perfectly

<Kimori> what? twinkies? they are tastey but it depends
<BaconMane> 0,5Asking these guys why they like ponies is like asking an alchoholic why he likes beer while he's drunk.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> What kind of show made for girls would grown ups want? :P

*Typhloni_link loves cheese balls
*CCCP hugs Jeremiah
<Kencolt> Desu-- literally, a form of address in Japanese referring to one self. It can me "I", or "Me", or "This One", or any of a number of similar things. For example, Wakarimasu Desu means "Yes, I understand", while Shizuka Desu would mean, roughly, "I'm Shizuka". Which, by the way, I'm not.

<Kecleondarihu> J_G_Puff71, cool
<thelonecubone> J_G_Puff71: right now? its not even December yet
<Kecleondarihu> thelonecubone, close enough, I guess
<butler> I'll come back when something else is streaming, okay?
<thelonecubone> yeah
<Shizuka> 13so no one identified the movie huh
<Shizuka> 13was Inside Man
<DinkyDoo> Firee.
<Shizuka> 13borrowing Chaiyya Chaiyya from a movie called Dil Se iirc
<GottaHugEmAll> Not very many Americans follow Bollywood.
<Shizuka> 13inside man was an american film
<GilDash> Inside Man was awesome.
<Kencolt> I LOVE THIS SONG.
<AdamTheDuck> Civilisaiton song? .-.
<butler> never heard of it
<GottaHugEmAll> This sounds American Indian
<pony_9401> Civilization V song?
<Shizuka> 13swahili
<AdamTheDuck> :$
<Shizuka> 13singing the lords prayer as i recall
<Shizuka> 13baba yetu is "father christ" or something like that
<pony_9401> Please, Oh mighty stream, work.
<pony_9401> xD
<GottaHugEmAll> I had a Kenyan friend.
<GottaHugEmAll> He was kind of a dumbass.
<pony_9401> It literally is still broke
<pony_9401> 3rd time I refreshed
<AdamTheDuck> Cannot unhear the "Civilisation your own little nation" part :D
<Kencolt> It's Swahili. It's-- get this-- a version of thye Lord's Prayer. Sid Meyer, the guy behind the Civilisation games, is also a very devout Christian... and so.
<Shizuka> 13yep :3
<pony_9401> What if Civilization V theme had lyrics AdamTheDuck?
<GottaHugEmAll> pony_9401 Whoah
<Kecleondarihu> Really? I didn't know that.
<pony_9401> ?
<AdamTheDuck> This is quite nice to a fireplace :3
<AdamTheDuck> I never heard the original song until now
<Kencolt> As Meyer once apparently said, "Is there no greater sign of the Lord's hand that the very existance of Civilisation?"
<butler> is there a streaming schedule here? I'd like to suggest some vids.
<GottaHugEmAll> I hardly play video games
<pony_9401> Perfect
<AdamTheDuck> butler, nope, it's whoever is around and if they feel like it.
<pony_9401> My live stream COMPLETELY broke now
<thelonecubone> pony_9401: what browser are you using?
<Kencolt> butler: Basically, except for BMN and a few scehduled events-- well, anything could happen here. And often does.
<butler> ok
<AdamTheDuck> butler, occasionally we'll have things like Halloween gaming week
<GottaHugEmAll> Wait we're calling it Brony Movie Night now?
<butler> nice
<AdamTheDuck> It was always called Brony Movie Night wasn't it? .-.
<AJIsHaunter> GottaHugEmAll: Hasn't it always been called that?
<thelonecubone> eeyup
<GottaHugEmAll> I didn't know about this.
<Kecleondarihu> butler, usually when Wrek starts streaming, he streams for a LOOOOONG time. And this usually involves him playing a game for long periods or drawing ponies for long periods. But lately, he's also been streaming Cartoon Network shows.
<AJIsHaunter> You didn't? :D
<GottaHugEmAll> I only started chatting on here like a month ago.
<thelonecubone> Me too
<AJIsHaunter> GottaHugEmAll: A MONTH? :O
<thelonecubone> But i picked up the pase :3
<AJIsHaunter> I thought you've been here a long time. :D
<GottaHugEmAll> Yeah....Why?
<butler> wow! that's cool!
<Kecleondarihu> Weeell, there's a first time for everything.
<AJIsHaunter> I've been here since April, IIRC.
<butler> i started last week
<AttackWithHugs> Oh oh oh today is my BState cakeday!
<thelonecubone> I've been here before school started
<AdamTheDuck> This reminds me of Alice OST .-.
<GottaHugEmAll> Sad that this was the only Pokemon reference I could think of.
<thelonecubone> liek, three days before it :D
<AJIsHaunter> Happy BState birthday, AttackWithHugs!
<Shizuka> 13mfw nopony knows what this is
<CacturnalBlade> AttackWithHugs brought me here but i cant remember when lol XD
<Shizuka> 13my disappoint..
<GottaHugEmAll> Like the only 5th gen pokemon I can remember by name is Bidoof
<CacturnalBlade> Happy BState birthday AttackWithHugs ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01i know what it is

<Kecleondarihu> Shizuka, you're being so obscure with your references.
<AdamTheDuck> So it's BronyState's birthday today?
<AttackWithHugs> Shizuka, NOPE. Chuck Testa.
<Saturn> 08,01GottaHugE-mail

<AdamTheDuck> Happy BronyState birthday then AttackWithHugs :P
<aniderp> nuu
<twilight_squirtle> Shizuka: is this from one of the games youve played?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello swack16
<GottaHugEmAll> I actually started on the day of the season premier
<Kecleondarihu> I guess you're trying to find people who can get the same references are. If I were in your shoes, I'd be compelled to do the same thing, except with more obscure anime.
<swack16> so what are we watching?
<GottaHugEmAll> because I saw this website mentioned on EQD
<aniderp> i rarely sleep
<AdamTheDuck> swack16, a fireplace...
<twilight_squirtle> sounded a bit like myst back there, but not anymore
<swack16> i prefer it on the big screen
<AJIsHaunter> GottaHugEmAll: Ballad Of the Brony led me here. :)
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<thelonecubone> GottaHugEmAll: i found this site with the ^^
<Kecleondarihu> swack16, fireplace with music from movies Shizuka's discovered.
<Bronysith> well you see
<Bronysith> i was really fucking drunk
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: he mentioned bornisteit?
<Kencolt> GottaHugEmAll: Well, welcome to chaos. But nicer than usual and you don't get chocolate rain messing up your hair.
<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle: Yep, at the end. :)
<GottaHugEmAll> I just had an ovaltine milkshake
<AdamTheDuck> browniestaet
<thelonecubone> but i didnt wanted to come till the end of summer :$

<Typhloni_link> So what did I miss while I was taking care of my nephew?
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: i see
<CriticKitten> :o
<Kecleondarihu> GottaHugEmAll, it's a nice chaos
<GottaHugEmAll> I want Ovaltine
<Shizuka> 13everyone better at least know this one..
<twilight_squirtle> this is from ghosties in the shell ofc
<GottaHugEmAll> moar Ovaltine
<CriticKitten> Yep, I know this one.
<Kecleondarihu> Oh, I hear Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig
<AJIsHaunter> I've never had Ovaltine before. ._.
<CacturnalBlade> this one sounds like GITS
<AdamTheDuck> Ghost int he Shell
<pony_1054> It's called Rise :D
<swack16> Ghost in the Shell
<AdamTheDuck> in the*
<Bronysith> Shizuka: <3
<Typhloni_link> AJIsHaunter: me neither
<Bronysith> Awesome song
<GottaHugEmAll> Would Discord like Ovaltine?
<AdamTheDuck> I regonise those vocals
<Kencolt> But, I take it, a longer mkix, Shizuka ?
<twilight_squirtle> я бегу сразиться с тенью лжииЁ
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: GITS SaC

<Bronysith> Ghost in the shell stand alone complex
<CacturnalBlade> GottaHugEmAll: of course, he would make it rain Ovaltine :D
<butler> more fire. somepony tell me when it's over.
<Kecleondarihu> Kencolt, it's the full version. The TV versions of almost ALL anime OP/EDs are shortened from the full versions.
<pony_1054> Well, the song is called Rise, but yes, it's from GitS 2nd GIG
<Saturn> 08,01what's an OP/ED?
<Shizuka> 13opening, ending

I said, "We're looking at the ponies" :>
*GottaHugEmAll gives CacturnalBlade glass of Ovaltine

<pony_265> was talking about stream
<thelonecubone> I know
<thelonecubone> But the voice makes you uncomfortable?
<twilight_squirtle> Typhloni_link: basically there used to be a way to tell which pony is inside the bag by the code on it, but idk if that works with the newer waves
<AdamTheDuck> Good Gil-oh damnit
<CacturnalBlade> Yay 8-bit wrap up!
<Kecleondarihu> Oh yes. That's right. Shizuka hates winter.
<Typhloni_link> twilight_squirtle: is there like a list or chart I can look at? That would be really cool to see because I really want a Pinkie Pie

<Typhloni_link> Ponies47: read the name carefully XD
<Ponies47> Typhloni_link, OH! XD
<VenHur> 3 and 4 will most likely be either B Movies or Worst Movie Clauses.
<J_G_Puff71> Shizuka: Is Home Alone 2 an A or a B?(Unless you guys do some Home Alone double feature when you guys do a Christmas special stream)
<Typhloni_link> Ponies47: lol yup, you missed out on the pokemon nicknames
<Canadian_Brony> I love Home Home 1 and 2
<Shizuka> 13we're still debating our christmas plans
<AJIsHaunter> J_G_Puff71: The first 2 would be A, the third would probably be B. :)
<Canadian_Brony> never saw 3, didn't even know there was a 4
<cachikorita01> 3 and 4 suck ass
<weeping_pegasi82> show the christmas episode of spongebob
<VenHur> I love Home Alone 1 and 2, I HATE 3 and 4...

<Karl> hello everyone
<twilight_squirtle> yeah 3 and 4 suck, 1 and 2 are good

<weeping_pegasi82> Karl: good you?
<VenHur> Wait, there's a five?
<VenHur> I don't think so.
<twilight_squirtle> cachikorita01: wahuh? then i guess ive not even seen the 4th one
<J_G_Puff71> Shizuka: So would voting certian Christmas films put me at risk of getting them rerolled since you guys may play them anyway later in the month?

<AJIsHaunter> What is, VenHur?
<VenHur> They ARE making a Home Alone 5.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Shizuka, I hear mellohi?
<Shizuka> 13far
<Karl> :-)
<Nittany_Discord> Would rifftrax save Star Wars Holiday Special?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Aaah
<cratorkid> AJIsHaunter: CIDER
<VenHur> The Good News: It's a made for tv movie.
<cachikorita01> gee, bronystate, what do you want to do tonight?
<AJIsHaunter> It's nice, Saturn. :)
<Karl> I love Cider!
<DoctoDoctorWho> VenHur: I didnt know there was a four! What is this?
<J_G_Puff71> Nittany_Discord: It's the only way I can get through it
<AJIsHaunter> cachikorita01: Relax and enjoy life? :)
<Shizuka> 13so enlighten me ponies
<Shizuka> 13wtf is home alone
<cachikorita01> not the answer i was expecting
<gunthler> Saturn: Venus is attractive O////////o
<Shammy> Shizuka: le gasp!
<FlutterSAUR> Shizuka: a movie
<cachikorita01> Shizuka: when you are alone at home BA DUM TSS
<Brad[Laptop]> Got a brohoof from a home depot employee today. First IRL brony I have met.
<Cypresswolf> For those that haven't - its about the animal in the manger the night Jesus was born - they get the gift to speak for one night, but spend most of their time argueing amongst themeselves - turn away Mary & Joseph when they come by - but invite them back when they realize why they were given the gift to speak
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Got a brohoof from a home depot employee today. First IRL brony I have met.
<FlutterSAUR> Shizuka: a rather good movie
<VenHur> Shizuka: One of byfar, the GREATEST two holiday movies ever.
<AJIsHaunter> Shizuka: Kid gets left alone by accident, something goes amiss that involves him, they try to make it back home to the kid while the kid handles the problem himself basically.
<VenHur> Shizuka: ...Until 3, 4, and 5/The Holiday Heist ruined everything...
<cratorkid> Shizuka: bout a kid, gets left home alone, shenanigans insue
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Shizuka, the first one is about....oh wait that means I'd be spoiling the movie
<AssaultWithEmbraces> DISREGARD ALL I SAID
<Shizuka> 13uh huh..
<AJIsHaunter> Regard ALL you said!
<Cypresswolf> Home Alone...there's a movie I havent heard of in years....can't remember much about it other than a kid is left home while family is on vacation and he defends his home from burglars
<Karl> *sings* The sun goes down the stares come out
<NocturnalBlade> what Cypresswolf said ^_^
<FlutterSAUR> to think i'm playing Home Alone's song in band, "Somewhere in My Memory"
<VenHur> Shizuka: You're not showing signs of sarcasm, are you?
<Kencolt> Cypresswolf: That... really, is pretty much it. That's prety much all there is to it.
<Afflict> nice haha
<cachikorita01> Shizuka: its about a kid that his family went to spend christmas on another place and they forget him so he stays home and do random silliness
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: That OC looks rather, feminine. Saturn OC's marefriend?
<cachikorita01> Shizuka: but then 2 pedophiles try to steal the kid
<Cypresswolf> didnt they make more of them? 4 or 5 Home Alones?
<Kencolt> But he does it in HILARIOUS ways. We're talking Coyote and Roadrunner levels of bad guy damage.
<cachikorita01> DoctoDoctorWho: Saturn r63
<Buytoast> Home Alone 4 is the lastest one i think
<Buytoast> and that's years old
<cachikorita01> it is
<DoctoDoctorWho> cachikorita01: I see.
<cachikorita01> its like 8 years old
<VenHur> Shizuka: It's about a kid, and his mom and dad forgot about him on some vacation, and from there on, hillarity issues.
<J_G_Puff71> Buytoast: They made a fifth one that was shown the other day
<cachikorita01> those 3 fanfics do not count
<Buytoast> In a shocking twist, McCulley Kulcen is now the role of the burglar
<cachikorita01> wait
<cachikorita01> wut
<Zacklego> Cant wait for Trixie
<Cypresswolf> Shizu - pro tip - don't watch Home Alone 3 or 4
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<cratorkid> ^^
<Kencolt> VenHur: Not exactly forgot--they honestly thought he was there all along and only realised the case was otherwise halfway across the contenent.
<DoctoDoctorWho> 3 Is fine, I liked it well enough.
<AJIsHaunter> Shizuka: If I may ask, do you have a playlist of this music you could share? This music is very nice. :)
<cachikorita01> Buytoast: they told kevin he could be anything he wanted
<cachikorita01> Buytoast: so he became a burglar
<Shizuka> 13AJIsHaunter: nope, randomly picking from my library
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: never watch 4, its down right awful
<cratorkid> cachikorita01: mfw my name is kevin
<AJIsHaunter> cachikorita01: So he became a bulbasaur?
<cachikorita01> lel
<cachikorita01> cratorkid: lol
<Valvad> Hello!
<AJIsHaunter> Shizuka: Okay. Just asking. :)
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, Valvad. :)
<Afflict> How'd you figure out he was a brony?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: *sigh* what happens?
<cachikorita01> hi Valvad :)
<Valvad> :)
<cratorkid> hey Valvad
<VenHur> Shizuka: You should go see Home Alone 1 and 2, they're classics, and if you dared to proceed, then watch the nightmare that is 3 and 4...
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: I dont know, was too busy bleaching my eyes after the first 5 minutes
<cachikorita01> Valvad: u new here? i've never seen you 'round this parts
<VenHur> And The Holiday Heist, which is Home Alone 5.
<Valvad> I come here for live streams for New MLP episodes every saturday
<AssaultWithEmbraces> VenHur, there are only two Home Alone movies. GET IT RIGHT.
<cachikorita01> Oh the spam time
<cratorkid> soooo, what anime is everyone watching?
<VenHur> Inb4 Home Alone 6 is released another ten years later
<cachikorita01> cratorkid: living fireplace
<Valvad> I need to catch up with Detective Conan
<cachikorita01> cratorkid: this is the best episodes
<Valvad> On episode 650
<cachikorita01> just look at that majestic flame
<cratorkid> lol
<AssaultWithEmbraces> VenHur, if that ever happens I'll somehow find you and hurt you :)
<Kencolt> Logs Burning With Background Music. I think it was created by Tezuka, cratorkid .
<Cypresswolf> I can't imagine a home alone 6
<Valvad> Wait just looked at my Anime list, I am on 663
<Kencolt> Might have been Matsumoto, tho-- the art style is kinda variant.'
<cratorkid> Valvad: oh, so its one of those on going ones? those are botherrsome
<NocturnalBlade> Wait, i think i came in late, are they making a Home Alone 6?
<Shizuka> 13can't stand those... FMA was pushing it
<VenHur> AssaultWithEmbraces: Oh please do, my house is booby trapped. :)
<Valvad> Yea pretty much, No idea when it will end
<Shizuka> 13they want to pretend they have a story arc, but it never ends
<AssaultWithEmbraces> NocturnalBlade, NO
<NocturnalBlade> Oh thank luna!
<Valvad> Also watching one pieve and reading Naruto and Bleach
<Valvad> One piece*
<AssaultWithEmbraces> VenHur, Mister Krispies will be the first to go <3
<Shizuka> 13until you end up with something like death note where they keep ramping up the stakes and it stops being plausible
<otakon17> Shizuka: What about FMA:B?
<Kencolt> Horrid and yet beautiful thought. Imagine Home Alone with a certain pony. Celestia help any burglars that try to rob TWILIGHT'S house.
<Shizuka> 13never saw it
<Valvad> FMA:B was beast!
<VenHur> AssaultWithEmbraces: No, anyone but Rick Krispies!
<cratorkid> Shizuka: bleach was rediculuzz, and dont get me started on Naru-filler
<otakon17> Shizuka: You should, much better than FMA in my opinion
<Valvad> Oh god Naruto Fillers
<Valvad> Those are the worst
<cachikorita01> i remember when naruto had 2 filler seasons.....
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Fillers were the exact reason I quit watching Naruto
<VenHur> What about DBZ fillers?
<cachikorita01> really
<cratorkid> i dont watch it anymore, but my cousins keep me posted
<Valvad> Is that Miku I hear?
<cachikorita01> did they had to do that?
<cachikorita01> 2 fucking filler seasons
<Kencolt> VenHur: DBZ has something OTHER thah fillers?
<AssaultWithEmbraces> And I couldn't keep up with the episodes coming out each week because I was behind so far
<Shizuka> 13for some reason this reminds me
<Shizuka> 13of all things
<Shizuka> 13encarta mindmaze
<Valvad> Awww
<AssaultWithEmbraces> So I said "Fuck it. Rescue Gaara was enough"
<twilight_squirtle> minus the fillers naruto is pretty good, but the problem is they shove fillers in the form of flashbacks even in the non-filler eps
<Valvad> The fire and Song remind me of....
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Hey Everypony
<cachikorita01> twilight_squirtle: exactly
<Valvad> Skyrim
<NocturnalBlade> AssaultWithEmbraces: lol, i forgot where i dropped Naruto
<NocturnalBlade> hi AssertiveFluttershy1
<cachikorita01> ^^
<otakon17> twilight_squirtle: What about Bleach? That's filler central
<Cypresswolf> encarta mindmaze :O That was fun game :)
<AssertiveFluttershy1> whats goin on
<VenHur> Kencolt: Oh yeah, sparky yellow hairdos! :P
<Shizuka> 13ATTENTION KAKAROT, MY HAIR IS OUTRAGEOUS
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hi AssertiveFluttershy1
<Valvad> Bleach fillers are not as bad as Naruto Fillers
<cratorkid> i stopped watching naruto a little after shipudden started, i never really like action anime that much anyway
<Valvad> Naruto Fillers are flash backs of things you already know
<cratorkid> Valvad: bhut the show can bore you to tears
<CrystalPhoenix> Damn you kakacarrot cake
<VenHur> Kencolt: And people screaming for most of the episode! :P
<AssertiveFluttershy1> exactly
<twilight_squirtle> otakon17: i watched some "le omg epic battlez!" of bleach on youtube, thought it was boring
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kencolt: yes, the plot is mixed deep in there, but its there.
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ I still have Encart 97 disc
<AJIsHaunter> YOU AM NO SUPER SAND!
<cratorkid> Valvad: bleach, that is
<Shizuka> 13i tried putting encarta 99 on my VM
<Shizuka> 13but shockwave doesn't work anymore
<cachikorita01> i think i left naruto where he dreams with minato and minato telss him he is his father
<Shizuka> 13too old now
<otakon17> twilight_squirtle: It does get boring adter awhile
<Valvad> Yea I am reading the manga of that
<Valvad> Got tiredof the Anime
<Valvad> Tired of
<Kipkat07_USAF> Shizuka: How could Radditz even hold his head up with that massive hair? O__O
<Shizuka> 13encarta 99 was the best too cause it had all those animations
<Valvad> Naruto Manga is sooooo much better
<VenHur> Any one remember that one Cell moment?
<AJIsHaunter> Kipkat07_USAF: Because he's fabulous~
<VenHur> Oh yeah, I been there... :S
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: There were many Cell moments. :D
<Dovah> Fairy tail is a good anime
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: I can't play Myst or Riven on my laptop - color is grainy and hard to see anything, but works - probably ruins the game discs
<Valvad> Fairy tail is pretty good
<DoctoDoctorWho> Kipkat07_USAF: So that hair WAS compensating for something.
<Kecleondarihu> What was that last song?
<Shizuka> 13realmyst might work a little better, once you get through compatibility
<gunthler> Dis song from SKYRIM! :D
<Shizuka> 13and yeah at higher res riven gets a bit too small
<twilight_squirtle> i dropped naruto about 40 eps into shippuuden, as soon as i saw the first filler of shippuuden. i still follow the manga, altho its been getting worse the last few months. kishimoto needs to take a brake and stop making new chapters every week
<Valvad> Sounded like Hatsune
<Cypresswolf> Oddly, Nightmare Ned, around the same age, works fine
<Shizuka> 13took you long enough to detect skyrim
<VenHur> Not just ANY Cell moments, I was taking about THE Cell moment.
<Shizuka> 13that last was Hatsune Miku - Kimi O Nosete
<gunthler> Shizuka: it juststarted playing for me
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Afflict I was wearing my rainbow dash hat.
<VenHur> The one that gave me goosebumps for weeks...
<Shizuka> 13mm.. that far behind huh..
<Dovah> pfft How could i possibly not recognize skyrim?
<AJIsHaunter> I stopped with Shippuden shortly after the Great Ninja War or something of the sort. I couldn't find the time to read it again, and I haven't since.
<cratorkid> and i wanna watch my little monster
<cachikorita01> yeah the great ninja war
<Valvad> Its getting very good >.<
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: it got worse after pain died. pain was an awesome character, but then it got meh
<cachikorita01> fuck naruto looks like if its never going to end
<cachikorita01> how long has it been?
<cachikorita01> 9 years? 8?
<cratorkid> 500 eps
<VenHur> Meanwhile in universe B, they had My Little Dragon.
<DoctoDoctorWho> VenHur: http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/vg/image/1336/32/1336327991491.jpg
<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle: Hmm, I'd wait until the end to see how it all turns out. But I loved the Pain saga.
<Kecleondarihu> VenHur, and How to Train your Pony?
<cachikorita01> that or Your Big horse Valvad
<cachikorita01> VenHur*
<twilight_squirtle> cachikorita01: yeah and its starting to have dbz syndrome and wont stop bringing every goddamn character back from the dead since a fwe months ago
<VenHur> Eeyup.
<cachikorita01> oh god really?
<swack16> OH GOD ITS STILL BURNING!
<Valvad> That happends to me all the time
<Valvad> Jokes fly over my head
<Cypresswolf> I got some Terra Glyph games - Rumplestiltskins Labrinth of the Lost & Hansel & Gretel....for windows 95...might play on vista...
<cachikorita01> hey how many saiyans do you need to change a lightbulb :3
<AJIsHaunter> cachikorita01: Yeah, Orochimaru/Kabuto is reviving the corpses of dead ninja, IIRC.
<Karl> Alrgiht guys I am off
<Valvad> 4?
<cachikorita01> just 1 but it takes 3 episodes
<AJIsHaunter> Bye, Karl. :)
<cachikorita01> and krillin dies in the process
<Valvad> Lol
<cachikorita01> LOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Karaoke
<Canadian_Brony> err
<VenHur> To those who don't know THE Cell moment, I'll remind you with one thing...
<Canadian_Brony> bye Karl
<Valvad> They need to power up before they have a chance in putting in the light bulb though
<Dovah> cachikorita01: Its funny cuz its true!
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: SS2 Gohan?
<Kencolt> twilight_squirtle: That wasn't the manga-person't idea. He honewstly wanted to end it with Goku's first death and move towards his son-- but his editors wouldn't let him.
<cratorkid> Nappa, discuss
<Shizuka> 13also
<VenHur> Random Guy gets sucked up by Cell's tail.
<Karl> Canadian_Brony: BYE!
<Dovah> ghost nappa
<AJIsHaunter> cratorkid: VEGETA! Hey, Vegeta!
<Valvad> Cya later
<Dovah> end discussion
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: you know i have this right http://tkj.vortalcord.net/
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: yeah and thats not all. i swear, i think theyve brought every single somewhat important character back from the dead at this point. kabutos technique is ay op for starters, and they never explained where he got all the chakra for it
<VenHur> Your welcome for your nightmare fuel.
<Shizuka> 13brain is still stuck in park on continuing though
<cratorkid> AJIsHaunter: AREWETHEREYET
<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle: Even the Third Hokage?
<Cypresswolf> URU I havent played in awhile...2 months maybe - was still trying to find the time for the portal in the books in the museum
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: well they did to some extent when narutos seal broke, he chatted with him for a bit. but they cant bring him back from the dead beyond that, he sealed himself
<VenHur> Shizuka: Your head is an amusement park?
<Shizuka> 13moula forums have a link to a portal calculator
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsHaunter: God dammit nappa...
<Shizuka> 13still accurate that i'm aware of
<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle: Oh yeah, he DID do that in the first Naruto.
<Valvad> I want to see the Third Hokage vs Madara
<AJIsHaunter> Valvad: You mean Fourth? The third can't come back.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Third Hokage is dead last I recalled
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: first? i was thinking of when his seal nearly entirely broke and minatos form or something appeared for a bit in narutos mind to prevent it from fully breaking
<Valvad> I know he died
<cachikorita01> obito. how the fuck did he survived the goddamn giant rock?
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: waaaaaait
<AJIsHaunter> PillowPoni|Phone: Yep. Can't come back. He sealed himself.
<twilight_squirtle> derp
<Valvad> But its just something I would like to see
<twilight_squirtle> i was thinking of minato, whos 4th
<PillowPoni|Phone> AJIsHaunter, Fourth Hokage is dead too
<cratorkid> who here uses Crunchy Roll
<twilight_squirtle> my bad :$
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: let me know when you play URU live again - I'll join :) - gonna go find my login info, see where I left off
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: yeah i dont think they can bring 3rd one though, he also sealed himself :P
<Kencolt> For some reason this brings to mind the fanfic "Friendship COntract." Twilight Sparkle for Haykage!
<Shizuka> 13i think all i had left was the pod donuts
<cachikorita01> Haykage
<PillowPoni|Phone> They're all dead except Tsunade, if I'm right. Ill ask my brother, he keeps up with this
<cachikorita01> LOL
<cachikorita01> lel tsunade is hawt
<cachikorita01> lel hinata is hawt
<twilight_squirtle> cachikorita01: yeah but that lava lady is even hotter
<cratorkid> inb4 anime boobs
<Valvad> Yes all the Hokages are dead except Tsunade
<cachikorita01> lel almost every naruto girl is hawt
<PillowPoni|Phone> Tsunade is like over 50
<cachikorita01> PillowPoni|Phone: aaand? she is hawt
<cratorkid> cachikorita01: more like every anime girl
<Afflict> ah
<twilight_squirtle> dont forget temari~
<cachikorita01> meh temari
<PillowPoni|Phone> But....50.
<Valvad> Mmmm
<cachikorita01> Ino :3
<Kencolt> cachikorita01: Every Naruto girl is either hawt-- or flatter than a pancake. And still hawt.
<AJIsHaunter> cachikorita01: Actually, I think her appearance is catching up with her age, so she looks very old now.
<twilight_squirtle> meh ino
<RDash5000> Hello fellow bronies :)
<PillowPoni|Phone> And she can literally beat the shit outta you if you piss her off
<AJIsHaunter> Hi, RDash5000. :)
<cratorkid> hey RDash5000
<DoctoDoctorWho> So the nine tailed fox can create worldwide earthquakes, flooding, and tsunamies? I find it hilarious goku can do that while powering up.:D
<DinkyDoo> Fireplace is best pony.
<cachikorita01> ino, hinata and tsunade :3
<twilight_squirtle> pain was an awesome character, his philosophy made a lot of real sense
<Valvad> Hello RDash5000
<RDash5000> shizu fireplace?
<AJIsHaunter> DoctoDoctorWho: Goku is OP. Nerf now.
<cachikorita01> Pain was awesome
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: comparing to DBZ again are we :|
<Kencolt> DinkyDoo: Well, maybe G4 Fireplace. G2 fireplaces stank.
<cachikorita01> he sacrificed himself just to repair the damage he did
<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle: What was the last form Naruto went through? Eight tailed?
<twilight_squirtle> i loved pains philosophy the most, i think it could legitimately work irl
<DinkyDoo> How long is that fire place going to last?!?
<AJIsHaunter> DinkyDoo: FOREVER!
<cachikorita01> DinkyDoo: its been like that for 2 hours or 1
<RDash5000> shizu fireplace is best fireplace
<Valvad> Npit 1 minute 3 seconds
<Valvad> Bout*
<cachikorita01> Valvad: loop
<cratorkid> ^
<Valvad> Ohhhhh
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: you mean the last bijuu chakra form currently in the manga?
<Kencolt> It's an eternal fire. It never dies. It's a thing of beauty and flame. It's also an AVI loop.'
<AJIsHaunter> ^
<AJIsHaunter> twilight_squirtle: I was talking about in the Pain saga. After he killed Hinata.
<DoctoDoctorWho> ded chat is dedest chat
<DinkyDoo> GTG everypony.

<Valvad> Awwww!
<NocturnalBlade> daaaaw
<twilight_squirtle> AJIsHaunter: iirc he almost got to 8 tails, but then minatos seal prevented the eight tales from breaking loose, and after minatos jutsu was done, he had all his chakra back, was in control again so he went sage form and beat pain

<AJIsHaunter> No one can win the game, silleh. :3
<HoodyZard> I did
<RDash5000> one does not simply 'win' the game
*Haku1013 is not stiched together rather crudely, thus making Haku turn into the frankenstien monster
*sonicdude558 gives RDash5000 a plushie similar to http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/8e32387056aedcd1ceb3ab5cb28fa1a2.jpg

<HoodyZard> AJIsHaunter: PFFT :D
<Dovah> see you tomorrow DoctoDoctorWho
<HoodyZard> Kecleondarihu: Actually, not a bad idea. I'll do that
<HoodyZard> Hey, who here has ever played Sonic's version of mario party?
<AJIsHaunter> HoodyZard: You mean Sonic Shuffle?
<AJIsHaunter> I've seen gameplay of it, doesn't even compare to Mario Party. :D
<HoodyZard> AJIsHaunter: I think. Was the main story about Sonic in 1001 Arabian nights?
<otakon> dammit
<AJIsHaunter> HoodyZard: Nah, that's Sonic and The Secret Rings.
<otakon> I've only got 49 dollars atm
<J_G_Puff71> HoodyZard: No that was Sonic & The Secret Rings
<otakon> I'll have to wait until I can put some money on my card
<HoodyZard> AJIsHaunter: Well, it had a side mode, and was basically like mario party
<HoodyZard> Minigames
<HoodyZard> Maps
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> J_G_Puff71 that game was underrated
<AJIsHaunter> HoodyZard: OH that, I know what you're talking about.
<Haku1013> nyeh
<AJIsHaunter> What's up, doc?
<HoodyZard> gdi
<Haku1013> hmm?
<HoodyZard> What was the last message I posted?
<cachikorita01> if theres one thing mario party teached me........... is that no matter what
<cachikorita01> no matter all your efforts
<Haku1013> Youll always lose?

<Kecleondarihu> I have $17.41 in my Steam Wallet. Putting $20 in it was a terrible mistake, as was buying that Magicka DLC when it was 75% off. So I'm swearing off any purchases AND Magicka until the 1st (or maybe 3rd) of December.
*HoodyZard drinks a shot of bleach
<Haku1013> hmm hmm
<HoodyZard> AJIsHaunter: Ty
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> cachikorita01 if Mario Party taught me anything, it was how to deal with the will to ragequit: STEAL ALL OF THAT SONOFABITCH'S CRAP!!!
<AJIsHaunter> sub06905: I AM THE CHEESE!
<HoodyZard> So yeah, sonic version of mario party
<Shizuka> 13this is Brainchild - Symmetry C (Lange Breakbeat Remix)
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> wait, what the hell?
<PillowPoni|Phone> AssaultWithEmbraces
<Canadian_Brony> that's better
<cachikorita01> Canadian_Brony|AFK: mario party: breaking even the strongest of friendships since 1999
<sub06905> ^
<AJIsHaunter> cachikorita01: And killing the palms of kid's hands.
<AJIsHaunter> :D
<HoodyZard> Mario party is responsible for over 30% of all domestic violence cases in the world
<Canadian_Brony> cachikorita01 Mario Party 7: how to piss off ALL your cousins.
<Canadian_Brony> AT THE SAME TIME
<Haku1013> nyeh
<AJIsHaunter> Honestly though, my palms didn't get that hurt during the controller spinning games. :D
<HoodyZard> Nintendo just tips off the law enforcement statistic makers
<cachikorita01> lol i once played mario party with my cousins
<cachikorita01> it didnt end well
<RDash5000> Michelle Creber released a new song on youtube. check it out!
<HoodyZard> LINK IT
<cachikorita01> i havent played a single mario party match that doesnt end on someone rage quitting
<Canadian_Brony> cachikorita01 did you play Mario Party 7's "Deluxe Cruise" with your cousins?

<Kecleondarihu> Hey Shizuka, Audiosurf is the only music game you have, right?
<AJIsHaunter> I have, cachikorita01.
<AJIsHaunter> No video links during stream, RDash5000. :)
<Shizuka> 13Kecleondarihu: yep
<cachikorita01> Canadian_Brony: nah we played mario party 6
<Shizuka> 13well
<RDash5000> sorry
<Canadian_Brony> Audiosurf is f*cking addicting
<Shizuka> 13i have The Polynomial but not as much happens
<Kecleondarihu> I guess you lack Beat Hazard
<HoodyZard> cachikorita01: How to win at mario party: Step 1: Unlock all the mini games. Step 2: Practice said mini games. Step 3: LAUGH AS THE WORLD BURNS AT YOUR HANDS!
<cachikorita01> i lost faith on mario party since 7
<Shizuka> 13beat hazard doesn't really interest me, i like audiosurf cause it's purely dodging
<cachikorita01> beat hazard is bad.....
<cachikorita01> imo
<HoodyZard> I liked MP7 ;~;
<Shizuka> 13yeah audiosurf has the other modes but i've never played them
<AJIsHaunter> cachikorita01: I hear that 9 was pretty god.
<AJIsHaunter> *good
<cachikorita01> i havent played 9
<otakon> Shizuka: you ever give Geometry Wars a shot?
<HoodyZard> Boss battles :S
<RDash5000> Michelle is amazing at what she does
<Shizuka> 13nope
<AJIsHaunter> Mario Party 8 almost made me give up on the series.
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyZard step 4: watch as you get 1's over and over and over and over until you use the secret reset code that only you know about.
<AJIsHaunter> Agreed, RDash5000.
<sugarponi872> hey bronies I got some good news! There is no school on friday for me!
<AJIsHaunter> Congrats, sugarponi872. :)
<otakon> sugarponi872: good for you :)... but why?

<HoodyZard> sugarponi872: HOW IS THAT GOOD NEWS

<HoodyZard> I STILL HAVE SCHOOL
<Haku1013> ^
<cachikorita01> i remember i cried when i finished the mario party 5 story mode
<HoodyZard> Canadian_Brony: SCREW YOU TOO
<Canadian_Brony> otakon never heard of a Non-Instructional Day?
<Haku1013> IM TAKING THE SAT THIS SATURDAY
<HoodyZard> MP8 story mode sucked
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyZard love you back~

*HoodyZard snuggles Canadian_Brony
<HoodyZard> MP3 is best Mario party
<cachikorita01> OBJECTION
<cachikorita01> MP4
<HoodyZard> Nope
<cachikorita01> IS BEST MARIO PARTY
<HoodyZard> MP3
<Rose`Bed> good night bronystate
<cachikorita01> MP4
<Canadian_Brony> OBJECTION
<Shizuka> 13MP5
<Rose`Bed> Bronystate, my sweet
<sugarponi872> Maybe on friday I could go get the new MLP comics issue 1
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<cachikorita01> night Rose`Bed
<HoodyZard> Latas Rose`Bed

<Canadian_Brony> g'night Rose`Bed
<Rose`Bed> lulu, sweet thing
<NocturnalBlade> nite Rose`Bed
<J_G_Puff71> sugarponi872: Its also on iTunes already
<AJIsHaunter> You've played Mario Party before, Shizuka?
<RDash5000> Shizuka: i c wat u did ther
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsHaunter who hasn't played Mario Party before?
<sugarponi872> J_G_Puff71 really? how?
<Shizuka> 13RDash5000 gets it, AJIsHaunter missed it
<AJIsHaunter> OH.
<AJIsHaunter> Sorry. :D
<AJIsHaunter> The joke went WHOOSH!
<bigmac> hello every one
<HoodyZard> I still don't get it :S
<RDash5000> i think it's more like 800 problems...
<PillowPoni> I don't get it at all.
*PillowPoni has never played Mario Party
<RDash5000> MP5=sub-machine gun :S
*Haku1013 goes WHOOSH
<bigmac> hello every one
<HoodyZard> Shizuka: Stop making edjumakatid jokes infront of all us dumb folks
<Canadian_Brony> WB bigmac
<Shizuka> 13the exact line escaped me
<Shizuka> 13figured i'd go with a safely low number
<RDash5000> Shizuka: understandable.
<Rose`Bed> its 800
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Rose`Bed> 700 for the MP5SD
<Shizuka> 13though when you consider the ratio of bullets to kills it must be closer to 80 :3
<AJIsHaunter> Hmm, I wonder if Rayman Legends will be available for PC gamers.
<Canadian_Brony> IMO the best Minigames were in Mario Party 6. I've held the record for fastest time in "Lab Brats" (I think that's the name) for 4 years
<NocturnalBlade> i must educate you my dear PillowPoni ^_^
*RDash5000 considers Shizuka's logic. accepts it
<Canadian_Brony> pfft
<Canadian_Brony> logic
<PillowPoni> NocturnalBlade, with what money? And the only console I have is a PS2
<bigmac> what we talking about
<RDash5000> everything makes sense when you throw logic out the window :)
<Canadian_Brony> Mario Party
<bigmac> k
<Haku1013> bigmac several different conversations to choose from
<AJIsHaunter> I wish I could've played MP6. I missed it by accident.
<Canadian_Brony> that was a fun game
<AJIsHaunter> MP7 was pretty fun, though.
<VenHur> Mario Party 2 seemed to be the best of the Mario Partys.
<AJIsHaunter> Had a pretty good time with that game.
<RDash5000> MP7's are fun...
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: I find the first one to be an absolute gem as well.
<sugarponi872> J_G_Puff71 Well I tried to get the comic but they said it's no longer avaliable
<AJIsHaunter> I love MP3 as well.
<Canadian_Brony> the day-night cycle can really f*ck up your strategies (if something else didn't already) and the mini-games were the best part.
<VenHur> AJisHaunter: Secound best to me if it weren't for blisters...
<Shizuka> 13hey saturn
<Shizuka> 13what's this otakonsong.mp3 i have here
<AJIsHaunter> I like MP1, MP2, MP3, MP4, MP5 (sort of, I'm not really sure how I should feel about it), and MP7.
<Canadian_Brony> ...
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka
<Canadian_Brony> play it
<otakon> Shizuka: oh lord
<Canadian_Brony> playitplayitplayitplayit
<otakon> Shizuka: it's Saturn's song...play it and get it over with
<AJIsHaunter> VenHur: I never really got blisters from that as a kid.
<NocturnalBlade> flash player :[
<otakon> yeah
<AJIsHaunter> ....
<otakon> :P
<Canadian_Brony> :D
<otakon> 6_9
<RDash5000> Shizuka: some time tonight, could you possibly play Michelle Creber's new song?
<AJIsHaunter> Um, what?
<RDash5000> :D
<VenHur> I loved Mario Party 5, what's different than the other is that the mode robot venchiles.
<VenHur> :D
*Canadian_Brony dies from laughter
<otakon> AJIsHaunter: when the whole "Ship otakon" thing first started
<Cypresswolf> This made my night :)
*Haku1013 is bored
<AJIsHaunter> otakon: Ah, I see.
<otakon> SUNG BY OUR VERY OWN Saturn
<cachikorita01> i loved the robot battle mode
<AJIsHaunter> Same here, Cypresswolf. :)
<NocturnalBlade> lol otakon has a ship song ^_^
<AJIsHaunter> cachikorita01: Agreed, but it wa smore fun with friends.
<otakon> SO! Who wants to see something a little on the weird side courtesy of RAWRity?
<cachikorita01> otakon shall be shipped with everyone!
<AJIsHaunter> *was more
<Canadian_Brony> "otakon will be shipped with everyone~"
<cachikorita01> lol that song
<AJIsHaunter> otakon: ?
<Kecleondarihu> So that song was totally uncalled for then?
<cachikorita01> otakon: meeee
<Canadian_Brony> otakon ehh, go ahead. Can't hurt too much, right?
<RDash5000> i was not present when the otakon shipping started. how did that start?
<otakon> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/252200_10151398800435802_1206853965_n.jpg RAWRity linked this in skype... not NSFW just ..weird
<Haku1013> hmm
<PillowPoni> Goddammit. I accidentally spill tea on the computer and it fucks up momentarily
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: oh...my
<otakon> PillowPoni: that sucks
<VenHur> I also loved the quest show game from MP6.
<VenHur> *quiz
<Canadian_Brony> otakon so we got . . . and . . . okay, that's just . . . WTF DUDE?!?
<otakon> NocturnalBlade: yeah... "Little" Big Heart.. bad pun is bad
<Ponies47> Birthday so close! 8 more days! ;A;
<Haku1013> otakon um... ok?
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: aint it though XD
<AJIsHaunter> I loved the cruise theme from MP7. It would've been nice if you could explore the cruise ship yourself, IMO.
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: is it salvageable?
<RDash5000> happy early birthday Ponies47!
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: like I said, RAWRIty linked that to me as a joke
<otakon> art isn't half bad
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: true
<otakon> but giant muscle anthro is ... well out there
<Buytoast> that picture was horrifying
<Buytoast> why
<Shizuka> 13a cookie to the first person to name which OST this is from
<otakon> Buytoast: you want horrifying?
<otakon> Shizuka: DAMN YOU WOMAN! ..Darwinia
*otakon wants a cookie
<Shizuka> 13nope
*Canadian_Brony throws a muffin at otakon
<Buytoast> let me guess
<Buytoast> Myst
<Shizuka> 13protip, i've never streamed what it's from
<Shizuka> 13nope
<otakon> Buytoast: I can show you horrifying... but I'll have to pass it by the mod first
<RDash5000> well i'm fucked
<Buytoast> well then there goes all my hope
<Buytoast> Civilization
<Shizuka> 13close but no
<Buytoast> Spore

<Shizuka> 13no and no
<Buytoast> Sim City 4
<Shizuka> 13yes

<Buytoast> never even played the game
*RDash5000 claps
<Shizuka> 13you get half a cookie cause i had to help you :3
<Canadian_Brony> my next guess was going to be 2...
*Canadian_Brony shrugs
<Canadian_Brony> I got Coke
*Haku1013 wants some cke
<AJIsHaunter> I've never heard of cke. What's it like?
<RDash5000> welp. goodnight everyone

<Canadian_Brony> I seez...
*Haku1013 noms on bigmac
<bigmac> ow
*Canadian_Brony pokes Haku1013
*Haku1013 puts some jetchup on bigmac and takes bigger nom
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: so you got most of it cleaned up?
<Canadian_Brony> what's jetchup?
<otakon> PillowPoni: make sure it's dried out, try some breathe through bags of rice in the case
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: ketchup but typoed
<NocturnalBlade> otakon: was about to mention the rice lol
<bigmac> get of me
<Canadian_Brony> you don't say -__-
<Haku1013> jetchup is like ketchup, only like, 10000 time better
<Buytoast> big macs aren't all that good
<Buytoast> i had my first one ever today and it was very dissapointing
<AJIsHaunter> Jetchup is ketchup's evil twin brother's cousin.
<Canadian_Brony> A&W burgers are so much better
<Buytoast> Nick's Gyros hs the best burgers
<Buytoast> that's just a universal fact

<LyraHeartstrings> we should listen to smile song remix
<twilight_squirtle> Shizuka: im using flash site one
<Shizuka> 13most clients use /msg but i don't use lightirc on site
<Shizuka> 13could be /query
<Sliverfish> "Slender isn't scary"
<weeping_pegasi82> well duh
<PillowPoni> NocturnalBlade, how'd I do what?
<Buytoast> it isn't
<Sliverfish> Yes it is
<twilight_squirtle> Shizuka: ah, /query seems to have worked, thanks
<Haku1013> hmm
<weeping_pegasi82> Sliverfish: just giggle at the ghosties, give him 20 dollars, etc etc
<Shizuka> 13other option would be to use the system tab, the one showing the motd etc
<Haku1013> NO
<Shizuka> 13i forget if we have that on our client though
<Haku1013> ITS MAH 20 DOLLARS

<SpadeGenesect[R]> otakon: I have no idea who the hell half of those anime characters are
<thelonecubone> SpadeGenesect[R]: :O

<weeping_ninetales82> SpadeGenesect[R]: ninetales can beat em
<thelonecubone> SpadeGenesect[R]: because to OP?
<Shizuka> 13it's composed by the guy that wrote the xp sounds

<SableyeWhat> otakon: Meh, this system is flexibru
<HoodyZard> Butterfree owns all

<thelonecubone> and finish my HW at school
<otakon> SableyeWhat: How High doesn't fit ANY of the criteria of an "A" movie. It wasn't high gross or budget, or well recieved and had limited theater runs. It's a B MOVIE
<thelonecubone> today was a good day =w=
<Houndoom_Joy> thelonecubone: How many people did you run over in GTA 4?

<SpadeKyurem[R]> Its more on the subject of said image
<HoodyKazam> Again, he rustled alot of jimmies
<HoodyKazam> And that's bad, apparently
<Eddmario> Alright everypony, look at the little red light: http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw2767_huge.png

<Jmo> I'm not complaining about the weather.
<Kammerjunk> Summer's too hot and the Sun shines on my monitors. Winter's too cold and snow, if we get any, keeps getting in my shoes. Fall's just cold and dark. Spring is somewhat adequate.
<AdamThePsyduck> Phase4, wooooot \:3/
<PillowPoni|Phone> I don't like the hot or the cold. Wonder what jmo has to say about that
<Jmo> >_>
<Vivix> I prefer spring and winter

<sub06905mon> :>
<Kammerjunk> I hate rain, it's too wet. I hate clear days, they're too dry and bright. I hate snow, it's too cold.

<PillowPoni|Phone> Jmo: I used to literally bury myself under blankets when a storm came to the point that I was drenched insweat when my parents finally managed to pull me out
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: Funny, thunderstorms I don't mind. They're awesome falling asleep to.
<Phase4> 00,02meh, i'll use the archie mix again

<AdamThePsyduck> Kammerjunk, Australia .-.
<Kammerjunk> Oh. Yeah, you probably don't see a lot of snow.
<Kammerjunk> Not even in the summer?
<CacturnalBlade> thelonecubone: then i give...i got nothin XD
<AdamThePsyduck> Why would I see snow in summer? .-.
<Sabershy> Hm, not sure, but can we discuss what happened on Sat. morning?
<PillowPoni|Phone> I get paranoid about thunderstorms at night durong spring/summer because that's when you hear lots of weather reports about tornadoes
<thelonecubone> CacturnalBlade: you'll soon find out :D

<CacturnalBlade> thelonecubone: how so?
<PillowPoni|Phone> And because of it, I'm afraid of one actually happening
<thelonecubone> not sure :P
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Std????
<CacturnalBlade> PillowPoni|Phone: aaaw *huggle*
<Sabershy> Um yea. Did we really get hacked?
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Oh s S d -lol nvm

<AppleBloom> all everypony
<Kammerjunk> SSD? What do you have now?
<PillowPoni|Phone> I don't mind just regular rain. When thinder and lightning start rolling in, I bring out the candles
<AdamThePsyduck> Hello AppleBloom
<JRP2234> Phase4 i reckon we should use cartiges for console games again
<AppleBloom> AdamThePsyduck: what happened you your original name?
<Jmo> Rofl
<Vivix> I am afraid of loosing my equipment- so during thunder I unplug everything
<Jmo> You wish you were a man Phase :P
<Kammerjunk> Air conditioner? I don't even think my radiator's working.
<sub06905mon> so SuperBrony64 whats the status on that Superman 64 stream? :>
<Vivix> Never had an AC
<PillowPoni|Phone> I'm afraid of tornadoes forming dufring the summer
<Sabershy> An airconditioner in this weather? You guys are hardcore.
<PillowPoni|Phone> I think it was last summer there werre so many tornadoes I fraked out at night
<CacturnalBlade> *freaked
<JRP2234> Phase4 remember last christmas
<Kammerjunk> See, that's what I like about living in Denmark, aside from free health care. We don't have any tornadoes, tsunamis, earthquakes or volcanos.
<AdamThePsyduck> AppleBloom, oh we were all changing our names to pokemon names earlier
<AdamThePsyduck> I better change back to normal
<JRP2234> so many cars were broken
<Vivix> Kammerjunk, same here- no scary spiders, crazy tornadoes-
<Vivix> only mudslides and strong winds
<PillowPoni|Phone> And everytime the lightpost near my window went out from a storm, I immediately go under covers
<Sabershy> Oh there is someone named AppleBloom? How cute...
<AppleBloom> AdamTheDuck: ohhh
<Vivix> but with the lack of mountains, you guys probably don't have mudslides either <,<
<otakon> dem mitts
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<CacturnalBlade> PillowPoni|Phone: daaaaaw that sounds adorable :3
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Uhh... We have hills, I guess?
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, our hills aren't that big either.
*Vivix has never been to denmark
<Vivix> but yeah- that's the general description I get
<Vivix> I like it in scandinavia- so safe
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: ...The tallest point in Denmark is 171 metres.
<Vivix> !
<Vivix> our tallest is..2800 I thiiink.
<Vivix> something around there
*Vivix sucks at geography
<donutpop365> Grr, still haven't seen EP4 yet :( been too busy.
<donutpop365> !c
<AppleBloom> donutpop365: go watch it then :3
<Kammerjunk> I don't think I've ever seen a natural formation higher than 500 metres in my entire life.
<donutpop365> !cd
<Tom> Episode 5 of season 3 "Magic Duel" airs in 2 days, 8 hours, 8 minutes, 33 seconds (Dec 01 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Kammerjunk> I don't travel much.
<JRP2234> pinkie salad
<Sabershy> Thank you Tom.
<donutpop365> AppleBloom: Busy right now though :( Am here against my better judgement.
<thelonecubone> now i need to go to sleep XD
<AppleBloom> donutpop365: well that sucks man
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I missed EP3 when it aired.
<CacturnalBlade> nite thelonecubone
<donutpop365> AppleBloom: Indeed.
<Vivix> Seen them all on air so far
<donutpop365> Kammerjunk: Same.

<Vivix> nightnight
<donutpop365> Goodnight ptrwager.
<thelonecubone> Night ptrwager :)
<ptrwager> same time tomarrow
<Kammerjunk> I was busy doing nothing. When I'm busy, I just kinda tune out and relax for a minute.
<Moopy> yo what s going on everypony
<Kammerjunk> Worrying is tiring.
<CacturnalBlade> nite Vivix and ptrwager
<ptrwager> gnight
<CacturnalBlade> what up Moopy
<ptrwager> :P
<donutpop365> Mmmm, ginger beer is tasty.
<Moopy> yo
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Moopy.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hi Moopy
<Vivix> woop I'm not sleepin, just said night to him
<JRP2234> 9999999999999999999999
<CacturnalBlade> oh sorry Vivix :$
<Sabershy> Kammerjunk: The hack was sorta a downer, so maybe you were lucky?
<Vivix> naprob :3
<Moopy> sup phase4
<Kammerjunk> Sabershy: No, that was EP4, wasn't it?
<Vivix> yeah
<Jmo> 'hack'
<Kammerjunk> I saw EP4 when it aired. I thought it was kind of funny.
<AppleBloom> speaking of the hack, have we taken precautions to ensure that doesn't happen again?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02sub06905mon: Don't have the game yet >>;
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Moopy
<Vivix> I saw ep4 somewhere else
<Jmo> It wasn't a hack for gods sake.
<Moopy> eeyup
<Sabershy> Kammerjunk: We on 4 already? Ah man.
<sub06905mon> ah
<Vivix> It was, it was a cracked authkey on mips wasn't it?
<Kammerjunk> AppleBloom: It's probably only something on mips.
<donutpop365> AppleBloom: Oooh! What happened?
<Jmo> It was hijacked, not hacked.
<donutpop365> Somepony hijack the stream or something?
<Vivix> in laymans terms that's the same
<donutpop365> Vivix: Yes, annoyingly.
<AppleBloom> donutpop365: GNAA got on the stream and started linking profanity and other vulgarities, took away over half the episode from us
<Sabershy> Ah so we did get hacked? That is kinda... disappointing? Depressing?
<Vivix> I think I hopped into Ustream
<donutpop365> Vivix: and Hacker means OMG AUGH TERRORIST in layman's terms...
<Jmo> Peanut.
<Vivix> so I caught everything after theee first break
<Vivix> true, hehe
<Kammerjunk> I thought it was kind of funny. I watched it in 720p not long after, anyway.
<Vivix> yeah the 1080p was fast that day too
<Phase4> 00,02stupid buggy ramps
<XAX> Phase4: Going at terminal velocity on TF2 when suddenly you stop on a surf ramp. yeah good.
<AppleBloom> I find it impressive that only 8 hours afters the upload episode four had like a quarter million views on it
<Sabershy> Same here, but it is kinda sad whn you get up 7 in the morning to watch a nice show and others are out to ruin it.
<Vivix> yea~~
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
<AppleBloom> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, I suppose you people in America got up early to watch it.
<Vivix> I didn't think it was funny, but then again, I don't really have a sense of humour in that regard
<donutpop365> G'night TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<Sabershy> Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT! :)
<Vivix> 16:30, kinda- perfect time
<AppleBloom> well what was humorous Vivix was the fact that the episode was against bullying, and they did just that
<Vivix> Hehe, that's true
<Moopy> See this is why we need some pony to boot GNAA offline forever and get mips tv back AppleBloom
<Vivix> no we just ignore GNAA
<Sabershy> Wow, life is really ironic..
<Vivix> until they go away, like gluefactory
*donutpop365 Silence.
<Kammerjunk> Sabershy: "Why does life have to be so ironic?!"
<AppleBloom> Vivix: gluefactory..? lol irony you strike agani!
<Sabershy> Kammerjunk: Seriously, :D
*Vivix makes a kaboom sound
*donutpop365 Explodes
<Phase4> 00,02gluefactory?
<AppleBloom> I have no idea what just happened in this game... All I know is I like it
<Kammerjunk> I 'unno.
<Vivix> Phase4, shooortlived hacker group about a year ago? Can't remember full name
<Vivix> "ANTIBRONY" something, they got bored and did other things
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<AppleBloom> well what I can't understand is why they target bronys, it's not like they are going to stop us
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm going to go walk my dogs, and then I'm going to leave for school.
<AppleBloom> bye Kammerjunk
<Vivix> Target us for fun
<Moopy> so my friends been telling me about the next update for minecraft xbox adition when are they doing the next update again? like about a week or 2 maybe i guess or i don't know?
<Kammerjunk> Bye, have fun.
<CacturnalBlade> hmm, guess i can drop the poke pun :D
<Vivix> Bajbaj have fun
<NocturnalBlade> there we go
<AppleBloom> Moopy: minecraft updates are never accurate as far as the 360 goes. They said that creative mode would be out in 2 weeks, 2 months later we finally got the update
<Sabershy> Bye Kammerjunk. :)
<PillowPoni|Phone> Bye Kammerjunk
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Kammerjunk :P
<Moopy> well AppleBloom i don't want 4J studio's to take out the creative mode cause i waited so long for it to come out so yeah
<PillowPoni|Phone> Okay, key oard is cleaned inthe spaces. Didn't have to pry off any keys
<Sabershy> AppleBloom: The mentality of bullies are hard to understand sometimes. Some hate you for a reason; maybe even a justified one. but others out there just hate you for your guts. :\
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni|Phone: yay
<Jmo> dat key oard inthe
<AppleBloom> Moopy: they're not going to remove it, it's just take what they say witha grain of salt. They pretty much dont know when the update will come out
<AppleBloom> Sabershy: love and tolerate?
<Moopy> Oh just asking though
<PillowPoni|Phone> Dat Jmo.
<Jmo> Dat Fluffeh.
<Sabershy> AppleBloom: Tolerate yes. You don't have to force yourself to love them.
<donutpop365> I'm gonna miss movie night :(. I'm gonna be skiing though! :D/:( I am conflicted.
<PillowPoni|Phone> NocturnalBlade, hopefully the keys will fucking work
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni|Phone: i think they will ^_^ i just correct you like normal though :3
<PillowPoni|Phone> And the goddamn keys still don't type.
<NocturnalBlade> aaaw :(
<Vivix> how long is it since you spilled?
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<NocturnalBlade> not that long right?

<Moopy> i hate when that video does that phase4 like when i listen to music stuff on youtube its like its pausing it self or bufferd i hate when it does that sometimes
<Sabershy> donutpop365: Don't get me wrong. You will be missed. But you don't always get the chance to skii.
<Vivix> but if it's only a few hours ago, you might want to put it outside down and give it a while
<Vivix> my old keyboard could take- liquid poured into it, as long as it drained out and stopped shorting

*AdamTheDuck throws a hot mug of coffee at donutpop365's face :>
<Mega_Milk> grey world
<Mega_Milk> awesome -lol
<Vivix> I've never opened a modern laptop, though- so I don't know if it's a good idea
<Sabershy> Diamond Tiara is okay. I think she would be a whole better if she was good, but that defeats the purpose of having her evil. >_>
<Vivix> Hehe

<Jmo> Go jump on your hate bandwagon kiddo.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck stop that
<AdamTheDuck> Multiplayer seems to be mostly the same ideas, zombies on the other changed very much.
<TheRandomkid321> Jmo You blame me for hating?

<Jmo> Who said I'm blaming you?

<Saturn> 08,01i can knock it out in a few hours
<aniderp> then my mouth sometimes bleed..
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: O.o
<XAXpod> Well good luck, even though it's not a huge effort.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: Um...
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp, .-.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: o.O
<aniderp> the gums bleed a bit..
<AdamTheDuck> O.o
<Saturn> 08,01well, it's stilla bit of an effort because i need to research things, and i actually need to start working
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: That's... not healthy o_o
<Saturn> 08,01that second bit is a bit of a problem for me
<MadSurge> Good morning Gold_Demona! :)
<Gold_Demona> ohai MadSurge =D
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, hmm, so we better leave you to it then.
<aniderp> but i cant help it ;_;
<XAXpod> I get the same problem.
<aniderp> then someone gave me cookie thingy
<aniderp> then i stopped chewing on it
<Gold_Demona> cookie thingy?
<aniderp> like them snack things..
<AdamTheDuck> Horses \:3/
<aniderp> oatmeal cookie with the white cream stuff?
<Gold_Demona> Horses make everything cool. \:3/
<aniderp> horsie :>
*AdamTheDuck wants a horsey :3c
<Gold_Demona> Ride da horsie!
<aniderp> weee on a horise
<aniderp> you going to fast D:
<AdamTheDuck> Holding a gun like that while riding a horse is quite dangerous .-.
<XAXpod> Playing campaign, is he?
<AdamTheDuck> That and horses don't like high pitched noises .-.
<Gold_Demona> You train horses to get used to those kinds of noises
<XAXpod> SuperBrony64: Get the Stinger rocket launcher out on the horse : D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek poniez :D
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64, eww ponies
<aniderp> like link has a bow and arrow?
<Gold_Demona> There's this one dinner show in my area that's a horse show, and the stage has flashing lights all over the ceiling so the horses don't freak out when people take pictures.
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, hmm, that's interesting
<Gold_Demona> So I imagine that horses used in combat situations are trained to be used to lots of gunfire.
<AdamTheDuck> I don't horses are used much in combat anymore anyway
<AdamTheDuck> think*
<aniderp> a horse hugged me before :>
<aniderp> wrapped her neck around my shoulder
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, probably not so much. Not much tactical advantage to fighting on horseback. :P
<aniderp> you think epona will be in new zelda game?
<AdamTheDuck> brb~
<aniderp> ok i got an idea people
<Gold_Demona> There are Zelda games that DON'T have Epona in them?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yup, Wind Waker and Skyrim
<aniderp> windwaker,skyward sword
<aniderp> 1,2
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Skyward Sword I mean ><
<Gold_Demona> I don't count WindWaker because Toon Link
<aniderp> skyward has the loft wing
<Gold_Demona> I see
<aniderp> you go flying
<Gold_Demona> heh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02All the handheld Zelda games, aside from Ocarina of Time 3D, don't have Epona.
<Gold_Demona> The most recent Zelda game I played was Ocarina of Time on the N64
<aniderp> spirit tracks has the train
<aniderp> choo choo
<Gold_Demona> SuperBrony64: Don't those all have Toon Link though? Or are based on previous Zelda titles?
<Gold_Demona> Ah well
<aniderp> im gonna get a baby horsie and call her epona :>
