<Kencolt> Actually, Starswirl was the father of the Amniomorphic Spell. This comes from Amnios, or roughly Cup, and Morphos, or Shaping, suggesting that magic is shaped in the same fashion as a glazier making a cup. In other words, StarSwirl the Bearded sould be called... a Hairy Potter.

<Simon> damn Chemistry
<ncb_LuckyStampede> Why is it always experimental hooziwats?
<TOY_PON3> Luna: Awesome I'm so jelly :P
<emangamer> Luna: accident with bathroom disinfectant??? that makes sense right?
<Ponibas> DocSane - go to bed, you old fart =p
<DeadlyDoo3> guy's gonna be falling asleep, so LATER
<TOY_PON3> I wish I was born in the 80s..
<robokun> wow, thats the worst origin story i've ever heard
<DeadlyDoo3> Buh Bye!
<Moldavite> 1986 here
<ncb_LuckyStampede> Don't worry, they change it regularly
<Lunarletic> 1981
<AppleJackDaniels> 1988
*DeadpoolDash I was 84
<robokun> lol
<ncb_LuckyStampede> This series has negative continuity
<Tovler> 2 hours of these cartoons every day after school
<Moldavite> dizzam, 81
<Ponibas> 75

<Ponibas> NOw taht DocSane is gone... I'd the old fart
<Tovler> 5 hours of summer once a week. One Saturday Morning.
<robokun> ^
<Simon> these bubbles seem legit
<WarpWhistle> Askk Derpy to check, Simon.
<AppleJackDaniels> pimpsmack
<Ponibas> I remember rushing home to cathc the beginning of Silverhawks
<robokun> dumbass
<Napoleon_Dynamite> 6_9
<Simon> WarpWhistle: ponies do not exist in this Cartoon
<Lunarletic> how bout Tigersharks
<AppleJackDaniels> It was all about street sharks with me :)
<Simon> fail
<otakon> I'm back
<otakon> had to restart
<Simon> the strings are not broken
<Tovler> Jawsome!
<otakon> and damn it all my ANT isn't compatible
<WarpWhistle> Simon: I've seen bears and gators. How can we be too sure....
<robokun> talk about high tension line
<Simon> speaking of physics...
<ncb_LuckyStampede> I think street sharks was around when I started watching cartoons ironically
<Simon> WarpWhistle: so are they ponies?
<MahBoi777> Pinkie Pie?
<ncb_LuckyStampede> Because that show was shit.
<Luna> 07,01physics? which physics?
<Simon> 4th wall again
<Lunarletic> What is a Physics?
<Luna> 07,01no idea
<AppleJackDaniels> Tovler Bro/][\Hoof
*Luna 07,01yawns sleepily
<Simon> lol "A" physics
<MahBoi777> I have forgotten what Physics were
<robokun> i don't know, i've never heard that word before
<Dark_Horst> sttreet sharks, the cheap knockoff of extreme dinosaurs
<TOY_PON3> Physics? Ha that's funny
<Lunarletic> A miserable pile of secrets
<Simon> dem SFXs
<Lunarletic> bah
<owlicious> How does decreasing the quantity of money decrease its value?
<Tovler> idunno. I liked how the people knew the Street Sharks used to be teens. They could have gone for the secret identity thing, but they didn't
*DeadpoolDash Tailspin was the only Disney show that actually acknowledged physics
<WarpWhistle> Simon: I don't see why not, especially cause most disney cartoons of this era existed in a world where all cartoons converged, like Roger Rabit or Bonkers.
<otakon> Luna: night dear after this if I forget or miss you!
<Rados130> Luna stay awake u are master of da MOOOOOOOON!
<Lunarletic> Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers
<AppleJackDaniels> Xtreme Dinos was awesome to. I still have my T rex toy with lether jaket and bike chain

<Simon> WarpWhistle: eh, I don't see any ponies in this cartoon anyway
<Rados130> 1:17 on EST
<Simon> Lunarletic: 2pm
<otakon> RoflBot: same here
<TOY_PON3> even princesses need their beauty sleep ^^
<USUBrony> 11:17pm here
<robokun> i do like the idea of all the disney afternoon cartoons being in one continuity
*DeadpoolDash 9:17 PM for me
<kenne_> only 1am where i m at
<AppleJackDaniels> 12:17
<RoflBot> ponies would get old if we watched it the whole time

<Phase4> Simon: welcome to my world
<Simon> Phase4: 5am right?
<Phase4> its 5 am this time yeah
<Phase4> normaly 2
<Rados130> myes
*DeadpoolDash are there any Alaska mod types?
*Phase4 isnt going to stay up, instead he will get an early night
<Simon> suddenly buffers
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I looked at that pic and it hurt my eyes
<Simon> Phase4: when are you gonna sleep?
<Rados130> MY EYES!
<Tovler> I've never heard of dinosaucers. then again, nobody's heard of the show Rupert
<ncb_LuckyStampede> I've heard of it.
<kenne_> im excited about tomorrows ep being a fluttershy ep
<Phase4> not sure
<PinkamenaDianePie> The Roseanne-esque duck reminds me of the fat witch from the MLP movie.
<Phase4> probably 22:00
<ncb_LuckyStampede> Nothing can stop the smooze
<Lunarletic> Dino Riders
<WarpWhistle> Does tommarow's episode remind anyone else of that spongebob where Planton tries to make Spongebob more assertive?
<Simon> 10pm to 4:50am... 6 hours of sleep only
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Not the smooze!
<Ninjazz> yes

<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Holy-... that sounds familliar.
<Lunarletic> I was still very baby during fraggle rock so I barely have memories
<otakon> Fraggle Rock was awesome
<Tovler> get it? Wring?
*DeadpoolDash fraggle rock was okay
<Simon> lol ok
<Luna> 07,01muppet show <3
<Tovler> opening theme shot
<TOY_PON3> Luna: Rainbow Connection makes me cry..
<PinkamenaDianePie> Ohey! The title sequence just came full circle!
<Phase4> dat hoover
*DeadpoolDash I got annoying sometimes
<Simon> wtf is this
<otakon> The Muppet Show!
<Simon> AND it does not suck her up
*TOY_PON3 tears up now that he remembers the song
<PinkamenaDianePie> Simon: Darkwing Duck, you foal!
<Phase4> Simon: well she's very large
<Simon> PinkamenaDianePie: I mean this tool
<Lunarletic> The Muppet Show of course and what I miss the most is The Jim Henson Hour

<WarpWhistle> This show is bat s*** crazy.
<Tovler> It's time to put on makeup
<Rados130> Luna, guess what? TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!
<Luna> 07,01barbapapa
<Simon> Phase4: The physics are so cool in this cartoon
<Phase4> yes. thats how a vacume works
<PinkamenaDianePie> Simon: Oh. Sorry most people around here have been asking what this show is and I am getting irritated at their lack of a childhood.
<MahBoi777> wow, I do not envy whoever has to clean that up
<Simon> PinkamenaDianePie: Wasn't born when this cartoon ended
<Phase4> PinkamenaDianePie: so what's this show called? :P
<Simon> But I saw the title
<Buytoast> This is Duck Tales.
<Lunarletic> lmao
*Phase4 was born in the 90's
*DeadpoolDash Darkwing Duck
<Lunarletic> Darkwing Duck
<Simon> 1996

*Reiko was born in the 80's
<robokun> pinkamenadianepie: i was only exposed to this show when it went into syndication
<Simon> lol bubbles
<PinkamenaDianePie> Phase4: If I had more caffeine I would be pleased to assault you.
<MahBoi777> heyo Buytoast lol
<Buytoast> It's obviously Duck Tales; they are ducks and having an adventure.
*Phase4 hugs PinkamenaDianePie
<Buytoast> And greetings, MahBoy777.
<Simon> cool physics are so cool
<Tovler> she has a fat laugh
<Simon> fail

<thundermane> coke is made from a leaf that grows in south america that gives a small buzz when chewed like caffine, the gov concentrated it and thats when it became dangerous
<MidgetDrunk> \o/
<MahBoi777> ths is insane
<amissingpony> Anyone played the "Go Fast" flash game?
<Polydunami> Also, marijuana is illegal too for some reason
<BSN_Brony> u know the reason jp is doing so well is because his rig isnt weighed down by guns.
<SonicRainboom> Suddenly, after all the build up, SONIC RAINBOOM.
<TOY_PON3> Weed is not illegal....
<otakon> dman

<Zig> you decide
<SonicRainboom> What was that.
<Thunderpony> Drugs are legal
<BSN_Brony> the cherry boy hunter
<PinkieSpice> TOY_PON3: the only place it isn't illegeal in the USA is in cailofrina, and you need a doctor subcription for it
<amissingpony> If you time the presses right, you can actually get 1000+ presses before the cutscene starts!
<Thunderpony> Except for when they're illegal

<TOY_PON3> Thunderpony: Thank you for understanding me
<amissingpony> He cannot live.
<Zig> five second rule
<Zig> he's cool
<Polydunami> In California, the police would nab any druggie off the street and place them in jail
<otakon> and it only just STARTED
<TOY_PON3> PinkieSpice: I don't believe you I'm sorry
<amissingpony> If he lives, I call shinannigans.

<IrNotVisible> they don't work
<Polydunami> It's not my word. I know a man who was actually deported from California

<dshannon> -_-
<MelaPonie> how'd we get on drug policies?
<nekopon> These yays
<zackoroth> A war on drugs is impossible just like a war on terror

<SonicRainboom> Sit on da money.
<MahBoi777> and the crowd flies into the water
<TOY_PON3> A tit is like...I have no idea

<amissingpony> The webcomic "Questionable Content" features one yelling at readers from time to time.
<otakon> Does EVERYONE friggin smoke?
<A11ectis> Like woodpeckers?
<MelaPonie> so i'd say i'm in a good position to evaluate drug stuff
<TOY_PON3> peckers...:D
<amissingpony> Something like-- wait, I see what you did there.
<otakon> lol
<Ponibas> tits fly slightly slower than a swallow
<otakon> Ponibas: lol

<Placebo> You can build so damn high O_o
<BSN_Brony> oh gawd this guy, hes like the hulk if the hulk got stronger the sadder he got
<thundermane> TOY_PON3: what do people see in blazblue? its a blatant guilty gear knock off (which by the way is the best fighting game)

<Ponibas> I came for Indiana Jones.. and just forgot to leave?
<BSN_Brony> sumica, lets watch NGE next week?
<otakon> he has his own INTRO?
<Polydunami> I didn't believe him because MLP was a girls show, right?
<TOY_PON3> MACHINEHEAD is best brony
<Phase4> law, theres a 1.2 beta and a 1.2 patch
<Placebo> Ugh. 400 kb/s?
<OtakuTom> Thundermane, it's not a Guilty Gear knockoff...it's made by Arc System Works, the company that MADE Guilty Gear
<Polydunami> Well, it is, but it still didn't stop me from watching it
<Placebo> Yup, I'm home.
<BSN_Brony> sumica the english 1.11 or 2.22 movies, not the episodic one
<holyreploid> my brother has blaz blue
<Ponibas> dammmmnnnn... still no results from my CISSP exam
<holyreploid> looks amazin
<DeadpoolDash> stream seems stable now
<Lunarletic> hahhh
<BSN_Brony> PAWNCH
<otakon> oh shit
<Sumica> 00,10I belive we are saveing Rebuild for an event.
<Egrus> He's dead.
<otakon> this is getting REALLY crazy
<BSN_Brony> sumica what kind of event?
*Sumica shrugs
*DeadpoolDash I have 2.22, I need to get 1.11
<otakon> wait
<thundermane> OtakuTom: so they spent there money on a crappy remake instead of Guity Gear X3?
<TOY_PON3> haha
<Polydunami> Actually, I became a brony around the time of Sisterhooves Social
<Egrus> XD what's with the random YAY?
<BSN_Brony> you're tearing me apart sumica!
<otakon> Neon Genesis Evangelion?
<Thunderpony> Lesson learned
<Polydunami> Or something
<Bairne> So this is going to start making sense at some point, right?
<OtakuTom> I find BB to be better than GG
<Thunderpony> Not only does yelling make you stronger in anime
<Sumica> 00,10Trust me I want to show them.
<Thunderpony> SO DOS CRYING
<Ponibas> it's Sumica's ping
<otakon> Sumica: please no, it's so damn depressing
<OtakuTom> They took what they learned from making the GG games and improved on them.
<thundermane> otakon: end of evangelion changed my life
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: heres the yogscast video http://youtu.be/uLvNBB5kyY8
<MahBoi777> otakon: it has exceeded crazy
<Sumica> 00,10fist full of teath
<otakon> so
<otakon> damn
<otakon> depressing
<TOY_PON3> Sumica: You should play End of Evangelion
<Polydunami> I tried getting into Evangelion
<OtakuTom> Death/Rebirth and EoE were so messed up.
<BSN_Brony> <---actually understands NGE
<TOY_PON3> just so otakon could get depressed :)
<Ponibas> otakon, how do you really feel? =p
<Polydunami> First impression: GO AWAY SHINJI.
<otakon> no, really after reading up on NGE, it's damn depressing
<OtakuTom> 1.11 and 2.22 are both pretty good, though 2.22 really goes into some crazy dark places.
<Thunderpony> Well he was being nice
<TOY_PON3> First Impression: SHUT UP SHINJI AND STOP BITCHING
<OtakuTom> NGE was the first anime series I owned on DVD.
<Ponibas> i just read that as Voltron
<Thunderpony> "If you don't move i'll go around" that's pretty reasonable to me
<Sumica> 00,10formy understanding we are waiting for 3.33
<Ponibas> tired eyes are tired
<BSN_Brony> Shinj suffers from unwanted-child syndrome, of course hes a bitch, his dad made sure hed be one
<TOY_PON3> otakon: EoE made me so depressed I thought about suicide
<TOY_PON3> Like no lie
<otakon> TOY_PON3: thus I don't want to watch it
<Polydunami> I don't really like a weak-minded protagonist tbh
<BSN_Brony> EoE is that the movie where everyone turns into LcL soup?
<thundermane> OtakuTom: but guity gear had such a thicker more enjoyable atmosphere to go with it, BB felt so generic, GG was gritty and metal, BB felt like every other anime game
<Silver_Streak> PWOTAGONIST
<Phase4> i
<Lunarletic> I love insane hot blooded protagonist.....Lets Watch Getter!
<Thunderpony> Silence steve
<Polydunami> Which is why I'm skeptical about harem animes
<Phase4> am aparently going ot press enter to soon again
<TOY_PON3> otakon: I asked myself, Why do I keep on living if I may never find happiness? Then I found ponies and you guys :)
<otakon> Lunarletic: Gurren Lagann
*DeadpoolDash meh Eva is Eva, and Shinji will always be a little bitch
*Phase4 is going to go do school work
<MahBoi777> PONIEs
<Lunarletic> nah overdone
<otakon> TOY_PON3: good point
<TOY_PON3> :3
<otakon> Phase4: see ya!
*Placebo updated minecraft, realizes no friends have updated servers.
<Placebo> T_T
<Egrus> I want to watch Puella Magi Madoka Magika XD
<BSN_Brony> DeadpoolDash its not his fault :[
<Phase4> ding me if you need me
<MahBoi777> awwww
<otakon> Lunarletic: WHT?! NEVER! THE BUCK it's overdone!
<Polydunami> Egrus, that is a pretty good show
<Egrus> It is
<otakon> Egrus: another depressing, nihilistic show. no thanks
<BSN_Brony> placebo, hey. hey, come here.
<Sumica> 00,10it gets intersting around ep 3
*BSN_Brony paragon hugs placebo
<Lunarletic> otakon: I'll watch Lagann hen only and original series for first part
<otakon> Lunarletic: well, okay I can take that
*Placebo BSN_Brony Paragon +7
*DeadpoolDash of course not, he was just written, draw, and voiced that way
<DeadpoolDash> drawn
<Polydunami> I watched it only because of Studio Shaft
<Egrus> @otakon: not as depressing as Bokurano
<Lunarletic> the original's Giga Drill Breaker has more impact than Gurren Hen's
<OtakuTom> I haven't felt that at all when playing BB. I love the stories behind the characters, and I think each character is better developed than the ones from GG...heck, the only characters I can remember from GG are Sol Badguy and Bridget.
<otakon> Egrus: never heard of that one
<Polydunami> xD
<Polydunami> I've heard of Bokurano
<otakon> OtakuTom: what? no Potemkin?
<BSN_Brony> the most depressing show ive watched is the iron-man anime last year...holy crap wtf were they thinking?
<Sumica> 00,10suddenly sepia
<Polydunami> Is that the one whose opening is Uninstall?
*DeadpoolDash you want to watch an anime and be super angry at it at the end watch GANTZ
<Egrus> @otakon: just the premise is enough to break you down
<Lunarletic> Bokurano
<Polydunami> Oh god no
<TOY_PON3> BSN_Brony: what was so depressing about it?
<Polydunami> Not Gantz
<Metalrainbowdashchan> ..........
<otakon> Egrus: fantastic, no thanks
<MahBoi777> dude stole his hairstyle
<BSN_Brony> toy_pon3 it sucked so bad..i wanted to cry.
<TOY_PON3> :(
<Sumica> 00,10there was some mech anime that was realy depressing like that.
<thundermane> otakon: and what about axl and milla and sol?
<Polydunami> I want a strong female character
<Presea> o_O
<Sumica> 00,10like every othere ep a main char died or went braindead.
<otakon> thundermane: I know, it's just I remember the characters but couldn't recall the names, and CLIFF!
<BSN_Brony> sumica lacrosse plus?
<Lunarletic> I was gonna say GaoGaiGar but I think you guys would'nt like Yuusha
<Sumica> 00,10I cant recall the name right now.
<Egrus> Probably Bokurano, Sumica
<Presea> can't be as bad as my parents were
<Polydunami> GaoGaiGar is king of meh for me
<Polydunami> *kind
<Polydunami> Dang typo changes everything
<Sumica> 00,10nah it was on some island.
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: old or new anime
<thundermane> otakon: and testament and slayer, BuCKING SLAYER!
<Sumica> 00,10late 90's early 00
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: hmmm
<TOY_PON3> So who here likes Elfen Lied?
<Polydunami> Eh...
<OtakuTom> Which one was that again? I remember the name.
<Thunderpony> You mean the romantic splatter anime that involves two cousins?
<Ponibas> i missed boobies.. didn't I?
<TOY_PON3> No
<BSN_Brony> sumica battle royale?
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: the only animes that come to mind is when the seagulls cry which is fairly recent and another which is coming out now
<OtakuTom> Potemkin, or however you spelled it ^^;
<TOY_PON3> Thunderpony: Yeah
<Thunderpony> No.
<owlicious6_9> the one with the virus that causes horns
*DeadpoolDash Mezzo Forte and Kite
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: and boogiebop phantom
<owlicious6_9> also, i never got the * no naku no koro ni
<OtakuTom> Elfen Lied was great...I still haven't finished it yet, though.
<TOY_PON3> Who here has seen the Kite movie?
<Lunarletic> Excel Saga!
<Egrus> I have a ton of things I'd like to watch. How's Trigun?
<OtakuTom> I love the Higurashi anime.
<Lunarletic> lol
<Ponibas> Sumica, you should get Blood +
<Polydunami> Trigun is pretty funny
<BSN_Brony> otakutom spoiler: he marries his cousin.
<Placebo> Egrus: ending is weird, but it's hilarious.
<otakon> Egrus, jesus it's damn nihilistic
<Polydunami> At first
