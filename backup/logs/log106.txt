<Pinkie_Pie> 13It will change the face of the earth for him
*Luna likes to be hugged
<DecapPony> 3not as hard as watching everyone he cares about being tortured infront of him
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna again for good measure
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Thats pretty much what we are doing
<DecapPony> 3that would be extreme
<RainBroDash> 10...

<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony who's gay for prince-dari
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony who's gay for prince-dari is 8Apple Bl4oom
<Daz> gay? prince-dari you never told me aout this? xD
<RobotPinkie> I don't think that's how it works...
<DecapPony> 3this is going to be a great troll fic
<prince-dari> Some of the Skype quotes make it pretty clear.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 obviously it's because AppleBloom hasn't had "the talk" yet
<RobotPinkie> Makes sense, ValtheJean
<MeteorVenture> 4oh gosh oh man
<RobotPinkie> k, back to physics...
<Pinkie_Pie> 13RainBroDash?~
<Daz> makes perfect sence
<Luna> 7streams up
<Luna> 7Pokemon will start SOON
<Daz> I C dat :P
<prince-dari> Why do you guys want to do this to Val anyway?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It started out as a joke that he was a Tyrant
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I opened this channel as a safe haven
<Pinkie_Pie> 13And then our arms got long and curly
<Pinkie_Pie> 13And we started to plot evil
<Daz> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l9bssvphCr1qdprjio1_500.jpg
<prince-dari> O_o
<MeteorVenture> 4kinda like one of those trippy drug ads in the 80s
<ValtheImpaler> 2,14 mfw I had random disconnect
<RobotPinkie> Hot.
<Daz> mfw SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<VioletVanilla> prince-dari's reaction is funny. . .
*Pinkie_Pie 13is considering kicking RainBroDash before he gets a chance to see that link
<Pinkie_Pie> 13That will work.
<DecapPony> GOTTA CATCH EM ALL POKEMON!!
<MeteorVenture> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skoWq27KYeE
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Kinda forget about him, and I dont want him to have a link he could potentially give to Val
<Daz> ...that's just incorrect
<Daz> should be '*** ValtheJean was impaled by ValtheImpaler (double)
<ValtheImpaler> 2,14 how bout I impale you? :P
<RobotPinkie> GARRYYYYMOOOOON!!!
<Pinkie_Pie> Sounds wrong ValtheImpaler

<RobotPinkie> Well thankfully it's a fairly easy number to remember
<Stormy> Now instead of accounting or web systems homework I get to read stuff from textbooks, yay!
<Daz> i guess. AllisZero, as i'm sure you know it's that basically with impressionism art for looks / models :3. but uh, they aren't direct sequels or anything, so personally i'd make SS priority ; )
<RobotPinkie> ...wow, what a gift
<VampirePrincess> this is about the only thing i do on a comp anymore. other than itunes and homework. i like to read...

<Stormy> thanks, I think I'll just look it up at the library if I get the chance, though :)
<herospirit> : D
<Daz> the male pinkie pie from the fanfic 'cross and arrow' where mane6 cross over to a parallel world where all males are females, and vice versa
<WhatPayne> That's awesome, I'd like to have friends like Moss
*Pinkie_Pie 13hates having to keep a bookmark of Cross and Arrow
<Daz> Grandil - Do it :P

<Daz> also, Pinkie_Pie, did you register the names in #bunker or in #bronystate ?
<Colgate> Colgate!

<Daz> Those names are popular, and we had all (months ago to be fair) decided not to register those ones
<NightShade> bronies*
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Orly?
<Daz> ah well, let's hope nobody else wants to use them
<Grandil> Helloes
<Sathi> Hello NightShade

<Pinkie_Pie> 13Daz, I said I had enforce turned off for Rainbow_Dash and Bubble_Berry

<Pinkie_Pie> 13Which I wont
<herospirit> 15My link is drawn by the great Scootz herself, obviously.
<Grandil> 56k modems..
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Also, the registering thing isnt for Bronystate only
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It is for any channel that uses Epic chats
<Daz> =D
<NightShade> indeed I do, but I won't guard you ;)
<Pinkie_Pie> 13So, someone from another channel could register them anyway

<Daz> >Bunker filled with a few others >we don't have [two users] to encourage us. Wat indeed
<VampirePrincess> november. i cant wait.
<Grandil> And he beat's up a clown with his own shoe
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Daz

<Pinkie_Pie> 13Silermare is the one writing the fanfic
<RobotPinkie> That's the way you do it!
<Daz> He's doing it wrong, the dumbass. yer supposed to lean forward with nosebleeds
<Pinkie_Pie> 13We absolutely need her in here.
<VioletVanilla> Awww. . .
<Stormy> cool
<herospirit> 15You, my fair knight, do not understand the powers Of Lords Silvermare and Denied.
<Pinkie_Pie> Forever alone
<RobotPinkie> Yup, that's true Daz
<Stormy> I might have to read the other books again so I can remember what happened :P
<Daz> silvermane is male, and silvermare is HIS female ponysona for RPing. you heard of what's gone down in 'silvershipper' over the past 2 months?
<Luna> 7brilliant
<herospirit> 15I'm OUT OF THE LOOP.
<Daz> basically, a LOT of r34 fics. silvermane wrote most of them too
<WhatPayne> Make it go back inn :D
<Grandil> Oh my god.. Brilliant.
<Daz> herospirit you're just new, i can fill you in if you care to ask about anything
<RobotPinkie> LUNA

<VampirePrincess> lol yeah, i done that a yr too soon. i cant believe they butched the 1st movie so bad. they almost made a second one but nope.
<herospirit> 15I'm not sure. The lands of R34 are a foreign, terrifying place.
<WhatPayne> Luna is such hugable
<Daz> dashite and polarfire rule silvershipper
<herospirit> 15I may brave a question when I work up my courage, M'lord.
<RobotPinkie> did you take any Flootershai pics yet, Daz?
<Daz> and Pinkie_Pie do you know of the other silvershipper channel? the 'sister' channel?
<Daz> (cuz if not i'd rather ask them if we show it or not :P)
<Stormy> yeah, I was really disappointed with the movie too
<herospirit> 15HMMM?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Eh, I think I went to it last night, but I forgot alot of things that happened last night
<Stormy> I usually am with book-movies, though
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I was to busy laughing like a maniac

<VioletVanilla> I'VE ALREADY HAD YOUR KIND
<VampirePrincess> spyro movie?
<prince-dari> "From the makers of Eragon" - I wouldn't boast about that
<prince-dari> XD
<VioletVanilla> THIS IS YOUR PAYBACK
<Pinkie_Pie> 13What?
<VioletVanilla> MONEYGRAAAABUUUUHHH~
<RobotPinkie> I'm thinking of redoing Pinkie's tail right about now...
<DecapPony> 3HAI VIOLET!
<Stormy> I have no idea why anyone would think that would be a good idea
<VampirePrincess> i didnt even hear about that one.
<Daz> RobotPinkie got back recently, FS is infront of me with hair ready for hot water, pics taken, but not all pics yet. waiting for dinner, then after dinner. and i'm so sorry it's taken me so long, it's just i've had to go out erry day, some days twice ,to see like, lawyers, civil guard peoples, organising a ton of parental ownership stuff
<herospirit> 15*whispers* M'lady was having much with the spirits last eve.
<Daz> the tail could be improved
<Stormy> _Especially_ from the makers of Eragon. :P
<Daz> the hair is AWESOME though
<Daz> PINKIES LIES?!?
*VioletVanilla ponypounces DecapPony

<Pinkie_Pie> 13*cough*
<Daz> Pinkie_Pie is a 14 y/o?
<VampirePrincess> now if it said from the author of eragon....
<Stormy> Yeah, there were rumors about it for years before they announced it was cancelled
<VampirePrincess> different story
<WhatPayne> Btw it wasn't Tabitha St. Germain who voiced normal Luna, was it?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Anyway, what do we do until Silvermare arrives?
<DecapPony> 3who is 14?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I am you foals.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Problem?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.>
<Stormy> I doubt they even made it out of the Spyro fandom
<VioletVanilla> We write happy ponyfics~
<DecapPony> 3not really
<DecapPony> 3im 16
<herospirit> 15*wwhispers* M'lady is much too young for this "shipping" line of work. It is no place for a filly.
<Daz> Nice! watsup, kid? That's so awesome!
<Daz> <3
<Pinkie_Pie> 13*whispers* Nonsense, I have been on the internet since 8 years old
<prince-dari> Has a film based on a game ever been a success?
<RobotPinkie> It's no problem, Daz, take your time with it.
<RobotPinkie> What's the name of this song, Luna?
<DecapPony> 3ive been on the internet since i was 3
<Stormy> Not to my knowledge
<VampirePrincess> resident evil?
<herospirit> 15*whispers* her young, impressionable mind shall never be cleansed of the forces of Clop.
<Daz> RobotPinkie: pinkie's lies, like i said i think
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Didnt Denied say he was 15?
<VampirePrincess> or was tht the other way around?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13*whispers* Damn right
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<DecapPony> 3is denied a dude?
<Luna> 7indeed it is
<Daz> i THINK aniway
<herospirit> 15Am I the eldest in this land?
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, didn't know you said the song title :P
<VioletVanilla> It had been a long day, or thus was how it seemed, Celestia's sun hung in the sky like a flaming beach ball. The heat bearing down on Sweet Apple Acres, scorching the workers out bucking apples.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Im not sure
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Pinkie_Pie> 13You probably are Hero, you seem to be the most.. Reasonable
<Daz> BRB dinner y'all
<Daz> how old herospirit ?
<DecapPony> 3i can be reasonable
<DecapPony> 3i just choose not to be
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But, age is simply a number. It means nothing in the field of maturity
<Daz> sorry RobotPinkie ;___;. aniways dinner then flootershai
<Stormy> I heard that movie was pretty bad
<herospirit> 15I have survived 17 of the earth's rotations.
<Daz> brb
<Daz> mfw i'm oldest woohoo~
<prince-dari> There's something like 4 RE films?
<Daz> aniways g2g brb dinner
<VampirePrincess> i liked the one i've seen
<Stormy> oh, really?
<VampirePrincess> ?
<WhatPayne> So she voiced both Lunas?
<Stormy> Shows how much I know about that
<VampirePrincess> what?
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'd have thought they must be somewhat successful for that many to have been made.
<RobotPinkie> later Daz
<Stormy> There've been four Resident Evil movies
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<VioletVanilla> The weather would have been any for a normal summer, but this was mid-September, in Ponyville nonetheless, it shouldn't have been this hot.
<DecapPony> 3violet how old are you?
<herospirit> 15We are ALL too young for this line of work. This puts my mind at ease; I believed myself the only one.
<VampirePrincess> idk what u guys r tlkin bout.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13> To young for this line of work
<Pinkie_Pie> 13> To young
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lolno
<prince-dari> According to wiki about the first film: "The film received many negative reviews from critics but was commercially successful, grossing more than $102 million worldwide"
<DecapPony> 3im too young for a lot of the stuff i do
<VioletVanilla> Alas, it was, and Big Macintosh, Apple Jack, Caramel, and the rest of the earth ponies bucking around the farm were feeling the heat as it penetrated through the trees.
<VampirePrincess> i know bout the movies... i have two. the first and the last or third idk which.
<herospirit> 15Pinkie, have ye no shame?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Shame is for the weak
<Luna> 7drugs!
<WhatPayne> Red herring or not?
<herospirit> 15My mind takes upon itself the shame of an entire nation.
<DecapPony> 3i like your attitude pinkie
<VampirePrincess> ppl like zombies.
<VampirePrincess> lol
<Grandil> 3. 2. 1. Drop!
<RobotPinkie> FFFFFUUUU flash froze on me
<RobotPinkie> brb
<Luna> 7*smack*
<VioletVanilla> "Ah, sure can't believe this here heat!" Apple Jack exclaimed, whipping her legs out in a quick buck sending a loud crack into the air as shiny red and green apples fell from the branches high above.
<herospirit> 15Quiet thineself, Decap.
<Grandil> Ok I did not see that coming :p
<prince-dari> Hmm, the first film is a 6.4 on IMDb
<DecapPony> 3NEVER!
<WhatPayne> That's a negative.
<prince-dari> So I suppose that's fairly successful since it did well commercially.
<herospirit> 15I weep for the shameless.
<prince-dari> Maybe it's the exception that proves the rule.
*herospirit 15weeps for the shameless
<RobotPinkieX> ...and then my name was already in use...
<DecapPony> 3my mind is full of shame
<DecapPony> 3i just feel none of it
<VioletVanilla> "Eeeyup." Macintosh replied, lost in his own bucking work halfway down the row of trees. "When you said you're gunna be tryin' to do this yerself ah knew ah couldn't letcha."
<VampirePrincess> my lil brother actually found a halo anime series.
<herospirit> 15I feel only shame. Only. Shame.
<prince-dari> O_o
<VioletVanilla> (OOC: @DecapPony I'm 20 years old~ )
<prince-dari> I know the Halo film failed.
*Pinkie_Pie looks at names list
<Luna> 7you should be able to pick your own name now

<RobotPinkieX> lol goddammit, now it logs me in automatically...

<VioletVanilla> <.<
<VioletVanilla> Go die in a cart crash.

<Charles> heya VampirePrincess
<prince-dari> They were a series of games on PS2.
<DecapPony> 3my guess, he has watched a lot of porn
<prince-dari> TimeSplitters is a 2000 first-person shooter developed by Free Radical Design, now known as Crytek UK and published by Eidos, and the first game in the TimeSplitters series. It was released 26 October 2000 as a PlayStation 2 launch game. The game revolves around the concept of travelling through time in a story mode spanning 100 years. The game features a story mode, arcade mode, unlockable challenge mode, and map maker.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13*facepalm*
<prince-dari> "TimeSplitters received mostly positive reviews and ranks as the 6th highest scoring first-person shooter game released on PlayStation 2 with an average review score of 84.54%[1]."
<Pinkie_Pie> 13This argument must end now
<herospirit> 15...
<VampirePrincess> Charles: u missed it we tlked bout resident evil and the movies and stuff
<Pinkie_Pie> 13We have more important matters to discuss

<VioletVanilla> I could try writing it. . . o:
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Anyway, the next person to judge me or anyone else based on age gets a boot in the face
<DecapPony> 3i have a drivers license
<VioletVanilla> and as far as doing something goes, synctube always works
<prince-dari> Well I liked the Timesplitters games and they have good ratings, but on the whole you don't like FPS games?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13> Synchtube always works
<VampirePrincess> right.
*Luna thinks the chat needs CPR
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It gave me and Meteor so many daymares yesterday
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It took so long to get a working room
<RobotPinkie> ...I'd say something about needing mouth to mouth, but that'd just be wrong.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13And every time we did something went wrong
<prince-dari> What genres do you like?
<Grandil> Just a tad
<Grandil> :)
<DecapPony> HAI LUNA!

<prince-dari> "Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of videogames.[12] In 2010, gaming critic IGN named Shadow of the Colossus the second best game of the decade, behind Half-Life 2. "
<MeteorVenture> 4especially since it covers up some of the image instead of going under it and also because my duplicate detector probably won't see it as a duplicate

<TwilightSparkle> Hi Grandil!
<VioletVanilla> What kind of practice?
<E_N> 7Wrestling
<Luna> 7Remember the episode: Babies & Bathwater?

<Luna> 7^^
<WhatPayne> And the friend in MI3 party scene
<prince-dari> "A statement that represents something as better or worse than it really is"
<E_N> 7Wrestlers ARE awesome
<prince-dari> That's what my sentence did. :P
<Ghosties> 4Nobody ever dies in House
<Ghosties> 4It was stated as a fact
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that House will harvest organs from
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that House will harvest organs from is 14Hoity-15Toity
<prince-dari> >A statement
<WhatPayne> And he was also in L.A Noire
<Ghosties> 4Stated as a fact
<Youkai> except her
<DecapPony> 10indeed
<prince-dari> "4A statement2,15 that represents something as better or worse than it really is"
<Ghosties> 4You didn't indicate that it was an exaggeration. Also, this is the internet; you can't read tone over letters
<AllisZero> House is an asshole.
<Grandil> Yeah. But he get's the job done I guess
<RobotPinkie> He's very much the definition of chaotic good
<Luna> 7just a little..
<E_N> 7hm

<Pinkie_Pie> 13FINALLY
<prince-dari> Fighting?
<Jayne_Cobb> ?me is listening to Mrs. Robinson
<prince-dari> You can't have a discussion without it being called fighting?
<Canada> What's that you say, Mr.Jayne_Cobb?
<GGgala> oh lawdy, dat wincest
<E_N> 7You seem like you're fighting
<prince-dari> As I said.
<TwilightSparkle> me is keeping chat alive for luna!
<prince-dari> Whatever I do I cannot assure that what I say will be interpretted the way I intend.
<prince-dari> It's impossible.
<GGgala> that isn't fighting. it's foreplay.
<Pinkie_Pie> <Steven_Magnet>: Pinkie_Pie is Pinkie Pie
*Nittany_Tiger explodes
<Ghosties> 4But you can make it as clear as possible, and you clearly did not
<Pinkie_Pie> It finally got it right
<E_N> Dari, you said NO ONE DIES ON HOUSE
<Pinkie_Pie> After 9001 tries
<E_N> People have died on House
<E_N> YOu're wrong
<Daz> haha
<prince-dari> The onus may not be entirely on you, but nor is it on me.
<Daz> ah, two prideful people arguing. it'll never end
<CAJ> Ghosties: prince-dari LET'S ALL HUG AND EAT MUFFINS
<RobotPinkie> lol
<prince-dari> God.
<E_N> 7I was kicked on Bronystate
<Daz> that CAJ said! :P
<prince-dari> You can't have a discussion when bronies are around.
<prince-dari> They just whine at you about love and tolerance.
<prince-dari> :P
*WhatPayne is with CAJ
*Daz is also with CAJ
<prince-dari> There is nothing wrong with a discussion.
<Ghosties> 4I'm just saying that you cannot cover yourself when "Nobody ever dies in House" is meant to be an exaggeration when you presented it as a fact
<Ghosties> 4You gave absolutely no indication otherwise that it was an exaggeration
<Ghosties> 4Therefore
<Ghosties> 4It's your fault
<prince-dari> Lol, no.
<CAJ> I'm not preaching love and tolerance, I just think this discussion is incredibly silly.
<GGgala> at least you weren't banned!
<prince-dari> To me it is obvious what I meant.
<Ghosties> 4Lol yes
<AllisZero> y
<Ghosties> 4And to me you stated it as a fact
<Daz> didn't Ghosties have an argument about hating a certain movie like this a while ago too?
<Daz> somepony was banned?
<GGgala> you can just rejoin immediatley
<Daz> also, back :P
<prince-dari> It is not my fault that you did not see it the way I intended.
<GGgala> ...immediately*
<Ghosties> 4You never indicated it as an exaggeration
<WhatPayne> I try to preach love and tolerance, at least around here.
<Daz> you're nothing but a silly billy
<E_N> 7I'm too lazy to rejoin
<prince-dari> You can't tell my it's entirely my fault when I can't ensure you'll see what I say the way I intend it.
<Ghosties> 4You just cannot go "LOL you didn't get it" when your words had no implication that you were saying otherwise
<VioletVanilla> I'm going to bed all, can I join this bunker next time I log in?
<prince-dari> I think there was ample implication.
<E_N> 7Yes, it's always open
<Ghosties> 4Where?
<Ghosties> 4Point it out
<prince-dari> That's the way I interpret it.
<Ghosties> 4Point it out
<E_N> 7have a good sleep
<Ghosties> 4Show me where you had an implication that you were exaggerating
<prince-dari> >"People never die on House"
<prince-dari> >I know that people die on House
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Welcome, honored guest
<Daz> oh GOD, two prideful people arguing, when none can adming 1% error, is PAINFUL. either Ghosties be a man and say 'ah i didn't see you wrote it as an opinion / joke' or prince-dari be a gentleman and say 'ah i see I should have communnicated it better' GAWD. ... http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/4.jpg Please stop arguing ;___;
<prince-dari> >Everyone does, I would also assume
<CAJ> hai
<Ghosties> 4<prince-dari>: No one ever dies. <prince-dari>: In House.
<prince-dari> >Therefore people would assume that I'm exaggerating in my eyes
<Daz> pretty please
<herospirit> 15I am here M'lady.
<Ghosties> 4That's what you said, you never made it sound like you were exaggerating
<prince-dari> [22:03] <prince-dari> No one ever dies.
<prince-dari> [22:03] <prince-dari> In House.
<prince-dari> [22:03] <prince-dari> :P
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Where to begin.
<Daz> ;___;
<Ghosties> 4I admit this is completely stupid, arguing over words on the net, but you cannot tell me that you're not wrong in the least
<herospirit> 15We have a guest?
<Youkai> :(
<prince-dari> The ":P" also indicates a joking or exaggerating manner.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13CAJ, give us your "Opinion" on Valthejean
<Pinkie_Pie> 13CAJ is Herospirit
<Ghosties> 4Your obtuseness is coming through again, dari :)
<prince-dari> [22:16] <prince-dari> The onus may not be entirely on you, but nor is it on me.
<DecapPony> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
<Ghosties> 4And you always :P
<Daz> Ghosties, say 'O I C' or prince-dari, say 'Should've put it better.' PLeeeeaaaaase
<herospirit> 15Yes, I know, M'lady.
<Ghosties> 4It lost it's meaning
<TwilightSparkle> Who here whatches wrestling?
<Daz> who's gonna be the man?
<prince-dari> You say I am obtuse, and you aren't?
<Ghosties> 4Read what I said above
<prince-dari> I acknowledged that I was as to blame as you were, yet you still said.
<Ghosties> 4This is completely irrational
<Daz> >yet
<prince-dari> [22:17] <Ghosties> Therefore
<prince-dari> [22:17] <Ghosties> It's your fault
<CAJ> dear lord this is the worst argument ever.
<Ghosties> 4You never once said that you could have put it better
<RobotPinkie> lol
<E_N> 7Alright, I'm going to rejoin. brb
<TwilightSparkle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=kqKpR9YnNcE#t=27s

<herospirit> 15Are we requesting the help of CAJ?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I knew it
<prince-dari> I already explained expansively.
<Ghosties> 4All I know is that people on Brony State can have a legitimate argument as long as it does not turn into mudslinging
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Im not sure, he doesnt even know who Val is
<prince-dari> If you didn't bother to read it once I'm not going through the effort of reposting it for you to ignore it again.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Just go back to watching Ponies I guess
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.<
<Ghosties> 4Besides, I enjoy arguing with dari
<E_N> How could he POSSIBLY misinterpret it?
<Daz> :P who doesn't xD
<E_N> you were WRONG
<prince-dari> E_N: I refer you to the previously written statement
<prince-dari> The statement which has been repeated several times, just for you.
<prince-dari> :)
<herospirit> 15We cannot merely leave our guest without proper information.
<CAJ> :I
<Luna> 7ohai WIlson
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hmm
<WhatPayne> If olive oil comes from olives where does baby oil come from?
<Ghosties> 4Dari thinks he can put a ":P" and make it "exaggerated"
<DecapPony> 10yes we can
<RobotPinkie> Hey, prince-dari, you also didn't bother reading about that other episode where someone died. :P
<Ghosties> 4Because that covers it, right?
<prince-dari> As I said, it was obvious to me that it was exaggeration.
<Ghosties> 4It wasn't to me
<Daz> wrong in what sense? wrong in the sense that prince-dari had seen every single episode and said an incorrect statement? dari hasn't seen erry epi, so it's a joke / exaggeration, right dari?
<prince-dari> Well what can I do about that?
<Ghosties> 4Communicate better
<herospirit> 15Can not, my good sir.
<prince-dari> Maybe I can try to make it more obvious ok, but that doesn't assure me you'll understand my intention.
<prince-dari> Nothing ever will.
<prince-dari> Also, what does communicate better mean?
<Ghosties> 4Sure you can
<Turtaguin> hi everypony!
<prince-dari> How do you comminucate better?
<prince-dari> Everyone interprets things differently.
<prince-dari> There is no universal way I can make EVERYONE understand what I mean.
<E_N> You could have capitalized the word ever
<AllisZero> Yes there is
<E_N> Then it's pretty clear you're exaggerating
<Daz> Consider the following: prince-dari hasn't seen every single House episode. :P therefore what he said, in my opinion, shouldn't be taken as 'wrong / incorrect' as dari didn't have the full info to say with 100% certainty. Therefore he must've been taking a guess, making a joke, or *ahem* exaggerating. :P
<AllisZero> A monocle
<prince-dari> E_N: Different people would interpret that capitalisation in different ways.
<E_N> see, you just did it
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that got his/her cutie mark through arguing
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that got his/her cutie mark through arguing is 6Spik3e
<AllisZero> If you wear a monocle EVERYONE will treat you seriously.
<prince-dari> Nothing assures that people will see that as exaggeration.
<GGgala> wait... who was CAJ?
<RobotPinkie> ...doinitwrong, Steven.
<Daz> RobotPinkie: s02ep03 xD
<E_N> More importantly, who was phone?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Phone?
<prince-dari> [22:27] <prince-dari> There is no universal way I can make EVERYONE understand what I mean. <--- That clearly isn't exaggeration in my opinion
<Pinkie_Pie> 13...
<prince-dari> It's emphasis.
<GGgala> Phone? I hate that guy.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Who was in here E_N
<prince-dari> There's a difference.
<Ghosties> 4Here's the situation: Dari said "Nobody ever dies in House," when people have died on House.
<prince-dari> Though you may interpret it as exaggeration.
<prince-dari> Which is my point.
<E_N> 'tis a joke Pinkie
<RobotPinkie> What do you mean, Daz?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13>.<
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I see
<Daz> RobotPinkie: as in a future episode xD joking ofc
<Daz> O O OAOA
<Daz> O O OAOA AA
<RobotPinkie> lolol oh okay
<Daz> RobotPinkie: she's drying :3
*Nittany_Tiger is away
<herospirit> 15I opened the door...
<herospirit> 15It was Fone
<RobotPinkie> Yeah he doesn't have his cutie mark yet, maybe he'll join the CMC!
<Daz> JOIN, THEE HYDROGENBONDS, JOIN!!!!!!
<Daz> haha!
<Youkai> nevah
<Daz> CMC spike best spike?
<Ghosties> 4The worst part about this entire argument is that it's completely retarded. We're both not gonna change opinion obviously, so we may as well just drop it.
<WhatPayne> Oh god that dance
<Daz> hmm, how strange. normally when I open the door, everybody gets on the floor and starts walking
<Youkai> need more dance
<Daz> THE DY-NOU-SAUR
<prince-dari> Meh, there's not much I won't argue.
<Daz> Ghosties: my point exactly, like I said earlier
<Charles> hey guys
<Ghosties> 4I blame it on dari being British *smug grin*
<prince-dari> It might be a pointless arguement Daz, but what arguements aren't pointless?
<Daz> Ghosties said it first, he is manlier in my eyes for the next 24 hours :P
<prince-dari> It's just a bit of fun.
<herospirit> 15Boom boom shackalackalacka boom
<Canada> inb4 she has a medical emergency.
<herospirit> 15boom boom shackalacka boom boom
<Daz> prince-dari, arguments are so fun, i agree! so much thrill, much work to come up with arguments, it's awesome
<RobotPinkie> I don't know, arguments that result in some meaningful epiphany for one or both parties? :P

<Daz> i guess that's a good 'rape foreplay' as far as those go, but there are other kinds of foreplays
<Canada> @Ghosties the safe word was gagging. Obviously.
<RobotPinkie> it's called a "safe word", Ghosties :P

<MeteorVenture> 4lol it's from final fantasy
<Daz> in before the 196.97. and that right there is a hugeass clue, if you can work it out, as to what is killing him
*WhatPayne finds new fantasies every week
*Ghosties 4cannot juggle :(
<MeteorVenture> 4anyway though i don't remember it too well but i think it was pretty epic
<Youkai> youtube out of nowere

<herospirit> 15Why can't I chat in the stream. :0
<Ghosties> 4MAGGOTS, MAGGOTS EVERYWHERE

<Ghosties> 4THERE IT IS
<WhatPayne> I always say that, learned it from this
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not watching stream, but your clue trips me off as you're suggesting someone has a condition defined by the ICD-9 code 196.97
<Nittany_Tiger> .
<herospirit> 15http://www.synchtube.com/r/JWLS
<herospirit> 15bloop

<herospirit> 15Someone save our pony stream!
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd watch stream, but I'm in the office :<
<Daz> Nittany_Tiger, implying 196.97 is only an ICD-9 code. tip, it isn't ^_^ it's something else
<RobotPinkie> lolol I love Cameron
<Daz> who doesn't? xD
<RobotPinkie> Chase is such a woo-head.
<GGgala> word asssociatio: THE ULTIMATE diagnostic test
<FwriedWrice> Most drs are jerks. true story.
<WhatPayne> I liek thirteen
<Daz> Cutthroat bitch?
<GGgala> no, Cutthroat bitch is awesome. thirteen sucks.
<Daz> what about Masters too? and the P.I. is probably my 2nd fave char after House imo.
<Lukish> o/
<Daz> The P.I. was a fkin genius
<WhatPayne> GGgala, can't argue with that neither.
<GGgala> Kumar and the Mormon single dad were also awesome. why did all three awesome candidates disappear?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Died?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Its working fine for me

<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<WhatPayne> Actually I liked that one doctor candidate who thought just like house.
<herospirit> 15It was just me it seems.
<Daz> WhatPayne, remember the ep where House goes to a presentation by one of the people who went to his medschool with him? he dresses up and does that huge fake laugh. it's so good.
<Luna> 7so many spoilers suddenly
<RobotPinkie> Not from me, Luna!
<WhatPayne> I think I do...
<herospirit> 15This is business place. Stream is too open. :0
<RobotPinkie> Don't ban me along with everyone else plz :(
<Daz> spoilers? nuh rly, just saying this one time where House laughs in an awesome way :3
<Daz> implyin she did, RobotPinkie
<WhatPayne> Don't worry, there has hardly been any spoilers here.

<Pinkie_Pie> 13Herospirit

<Daz> RobotPinkie, have you seen this episode before? and i meant the wife is worried, cuz of the shot with her with her hand covering her mouth
<Pinkie_Pie> Well, I wanted to invite you and say "Dashie" so badly.

<RobotPinkie> I think it's ringworms
<Daz> "don't let her go to the bathroom!" :P
<Turtaguin> she should hve old the ring instead of cropping it
<Turtaguin> dropping*
<Turtaguin> sold*
<Ghosties> 4Yes, both House and Wilson are based off Holmes and Watson
<GGgala> hve?
<Daz> RobotPinkie, close, yes it's to do with the ring but ... well want clues?
<RobotPinkie> He had that face of "oh I know what's goin' on", so it's definitely ringworms
<Daz> ikr Ghosties

<Youkai> ew worms
<RobotPinkie> Nah I'm just kidding Daz, but I figure it's related to the ring somehow

<Silvermane> wow he can walk...
<Ziltoidia> >mah g
<ThunderDash> THERE'S SOMEBODY AT THE DOOR
*Silvermane really finds this guy creepier than the German dude
<Apokalipse> I imagine that's how Ghosties answers the door
<Ziltoidia> derp
<RobotPinkie> Someone's at the door
<FreezeFrame> Cena opening with XFL jokes
<RobotPinkie> oh my, this is just like American Gothic

<CAPSLOCKHERO> Well i got here late
<Silvermane> lol, Octavia, he just dissed your instrument
<Octavia> 14I'm not listening right now to the stream :P
<Octavia> 14Catching up with things still, busy busy!
<Silvermane> there is a cello that the cannibal plays
<Apokalipse> it was a compliment
<Apokalipse> guitars are awesome
<Silvermane> i think. it might be a contrabass, but can't tell
<RobotPinkie> German's gonna spoil the twist, I'm calling it.
<Silvermane> ^
<Sumica> here come the big guy
<FreezeFrame> It's basically one parasprite riling everyone else up.
<RobotPinkie> Oh, I guess not, lolz
<Octavia> Ew. Why would anyone move to Iran? :P
<prince-dari> I have family in Iran. :P
<prince-dari> I wouldn't move there though.
<Denied_Existence> LOL
<Silvermane> ???
<Apokalipse> I think it was determined that octavias instrument is a cello
<FreezeFrame> Who believes that making Ponysonas is going to make the FiM fandom devolve into the Sonic fandom
<Luna> 7*SMACK*
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<Dermathil> Now that you mention it, this is a very scary prospect, FF.
<Apokalipse> hahahaha
<Octavia> Ahh. Eh, I dont think anything could make me move there. lol
<Sumica> haha
<Dermathil> and LAWL.
<Dermathil> *BITCHSLAP*
<Silvermane> i don't know, but I think ponysonas are more fair to have than a hedgehog self
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hoo boy here we go again :P
<Sumica> Octavia: is a cannapple?!
<Silvermane> considering there are thousands of ponies, but only 6 or so canon sonic char
<CAPSLOCKHERO> Wait, is Octavia german?
<Silvermane> sumica... you can apples named octavia?
<FreezeFrame> And is bitching about the links to fanfic updates at the end of the Nightly Roundups
<Luna> 7Last IT Crowd for tonight
<Silvermane> he's definitely paraspriting
<Luna> 7enjoy
<Silvermane> love you Luna
<FreezeFrame> Because a link to fanfics buried at the end of a long post is a violation of "no fanfics mode"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 indeed, we wub woo woona
<Octavia> 14That reminds me...
<DecapPony> awwww, wha luna?
<Apokalipse> Octavia I'm calling you Škoda from now on

<Silvermane> Freezeframe, sounds like he just wants attention. That guy needs to know where he can get attention, like me. FOR I AM THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE! MUAHAHAHAHAAHAAAAAA
<Silvermane> ALL SHALL SHIP ME AND DESPAIR
*Silvermane /end attention horse
<Octavia> 14But that reminds me. Sathi has "Being female" in her description. I should have had put "Being German" in mine lol
<FreezeFrame> eeeenope

<Pinkie_Pie> http://synchtu.be/JWLS
<Apokalipse> ooh, Octavia is German. I was in germany two days ago
<Octavia> 14I figured. :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Me and Hero are getting bored by ourselves
<DecapPony> 10but its IT crowd!
<Silvermane> 14i'm enjoying this british humor
<Octavia> 14I'd ask where abouts, but I dont know most of Germany too well. lol
<FreezeFrame> Germans are awesome
<RobotPinkie> I've been in Germany a couple of times, but I never saw any ponies there. Suspicious, if you ask me.
<Octavia> 14Since I've been living in the States since I was young.
<Apokalipse> It was Berlin. I've been to Munich before though
<Apokalipse> many times actually
<FreezeFrame> Incredibly antsy if you're a few seconds late, though.
<Silvermane> who is random emo-looking guy
<TwilightSparkle> Anyone from Nevada?
<Silvermane> nob jobs
<Octavia> 14Ahh, okay. I was born outside Frankfurt.
<Silvermane> wtf is with his voice?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 silvermane: he was the creepy guy they found in their closet at work near the beginning of the season
<Apokalipse> oh
<Silvermane> ah. thanks valthejean
<Silvermane> first time seeing this show so...
<herospirit> 15Butbutbut
<herospirit> 15Ponies
<Apokalipse> wow, he's a ninja
<Luna> 7spiderman
<RobotPinkie> He's a vampire
<herospirit> 15I understand that IT crowd is one of THE BEST THINGS EVER, but
<Grandil> It's really not fair you keep showing this.. It's 2:20 AM here.. I really have to get to bed.. But thanks for an awesome show! Goodnight.
<RobotPinkie> not the sparkly kind
<Luna> 7ahahahaha
<Apokalipse> I need to go to bed too, but I want to see Xena
<Silvermane> absinthe wow
<ValtheJean> 2,14 gnight grandil
<RobotPinkie> night Grandil
<Silvermane> wtf are they doing?
<FreezeFrame> Silvermane: That stuff will mess you up.
<Silvermane> so i've heard
<Silvermane> has he ever had a white russian?
<Apokalipse> lol
<FreezeFrame> I prefer Irish Coffees if I'm going to do those, and I only get them with decaf
<prince-dari> MFW memory is RAM
<prince-dari> No.
<prince-dari> RAM is memory
*Silvermane loves Prince-IT
<FreezeFrame> All RAM is memory, but not all memory is RAM
<prince-dari> XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle is not a square :P
<FreezeFrame> All squares are rhombi, but not all rhombi are squares.
<Silvermane> a german is a cannibal but a cannibal is not german
<Ziltoidia> DERP
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good fucking god...facebook is deleting pony profiles....AGAIN....
<Silvermane> mfw she's just like them
<Silvermane> really? wow facebook
<Apokalipse> really facebook?
<Ziltoidia> ...
<Silvermane> that's what, the 3rd time?
<Ziltoidia> I want to hit her face with a brick
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I've stopped counting
*Silvermane raises his hoof for first opportunity
<CAPSLOCKHERO> Dat stare
<Sumica> Sounded like NMM
<TwilightSparkle> dat laugh
<Silvermane> creepy dude
<ThunderDash> doesn't facebook just generally have a rule against RP accounts?
<Dermathil> maybe if people understood that facebook profiles are used for real life profiles it wouldn't happen. I'm saddened by these deletions but they've had it coming.
<Apokalipse> but,but... pony
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, it technically does, but it seems to only crackdown on the pony accounts (well, one time they didn't)
<RobotPinkie> Such a sensitive guy
<Dermathil> Think of someone putting a fake identity in the phone book.
<Silvermane> technically, but the counter to that is that people get to make them for their pets, so
<Octavia> 14Ooooooooh...
<Octavia> 14I see now
<ThunderDash> yeah
<Silvermane> Dermathil, would anyone notice?
<FreezeFrame> Ghosties: Sin Cara vs. Daniel Bryan
<Ziltoidia> ...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the problem for me lies in with people like Hipster who don't want to use their real account on brony related stuff
<Silvermane> I think she's kinda cute, if she put her hair forward and stopped talking
<Apokalipse> make her shut up...
<Ziltoidia> this lady
<Dermathil> Silvermane, probably not, because there aren't any *Pictures* in phone books?
<RobotPinkie> AHAHA
<Octavia> 14I see why the Dykas incident is such a hot topic now.
<Apokalipse> lol
<DecapPony> that isnt creepy at all
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's just very lame that some people can't even communicate with us anymore because of that
<DecapPony> dykas incident?
<Apokalipse> I have a solution. Don't use facebook.
<Ziltoidia> ...
<Ziltoidia> so much facedesk
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, that's the solution pretty much everyone is doing
<Silvermane> Apolkalipse, if i didn't use facebook, i would NEVER hear from half my friends
<FreezeFrame> Val: Why not have them use FlankBook for that?
<Ziltoidia> tar-tar sauce
<Silvermane> flankbook isn't as strong yet
<Octavia> 14I dont have a Facebook myself. lol I have a Flankbook I dont use. XD
<Silvermane> it feels more like myspace so far
<Apokalipse> Really? Well there are things like... a phone. real life. email?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because flankbook is kind of retarded
<TwilightSparkle> the laugh the laugh THE LAUGH!
<Dermathil> >mfw I google Dykas and I get a result that says that Dykas actually lied about his father dieing in the Oslo massacre.
<Octavia> 14^
<Dermathil> (Suddenly I just lost a LOT of respect for this guy.)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ung....not the dykas thing again....
<Ziltoidia> lolwut
<Silvermane> Apokalipse, I forget half the people i know if i don't actively have a reason to remember them at the time. facebook keeps them available so taht i can message them quickly
<Octavia> 14Yeah, we probably shouldnt take about it here... its a real hot topic and causes a lot of drama
<Octavia> 14*talk
*Dermathil opens a temporary channel to talk about it without being in BState
<Silvermane> not drama, discussion. I hate facebook, but i need it
<Silvermane> (and what is Dykas?)
<Sumica> ....
<Luna> 7....
<WhatPayne> Peter File?
<Ziltoidia> oh man
<Nittany_Tiger> XD
<Dermathil> Silvermane, Dykas is the guy who changed his name to fluttershy Dykas
<Dermathil> Kim Fluttershy Dykas
<Silvermane> ah
<Apokalipse> ok silver. I can manage without facebook thankfully
<Silvermane> lucky...
*FreezeFrame finally set up a blogger account (that he won't use) to comment on EqD
<Octavia> 14I meant the Dkyas debate Silvermane We probably shouldnt since its a hot topic
<Apokalipse> I mean I have an account, but only check up on it once a month sometimes
<Silvermane> oh okay Octavia. what is the argument about it?
<Silvermane> i haven't kept up on a lot of things
<Denied_Existence> Wait...somebody named themselves Fluttershy?
<Octavia> 14Eh, read a few comments up. lol
<Octavia> 14lol DE
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's best to just drop it and leave it at "it's still a sensitive subject"
<Octavia> 14Only a few hundred in the community :P
<Silvermane> the thing about him lying about his father's death?
<Denied_Existence> Begin writing Alexis Dash X Kim Dykas!!!!!!
*Dermathil chokes as he sees the cigarette
<Ziltoidia> eeyup
*Dermathil chokes again as he hears the moanings
<Silvermane> i like her
<DecapPony> 10DE you get through to wrek?
<Dermathil> TELLY
<Silvermane> I REALLY like her
<Apokalipse> Does she have a ZX spectrum?
<Dermathil> HE FOUND A NERDY GIRL
<Silvermane> Apokalipse, who doesn't?
<ThunderDash> Vectrex?
<RobotPinkie> He did say ALL the consoles
<Apokalipse> yeah, he did
<Silvermane> lesbian
<TwilightSparkle> *takes 3ds from that house*
<Dermathil> she's into "girls"?
<Sumica> shot down
<RobotPinkie> So ronery :(
<Ziltoidia> dat product placement

<Dermathil> P. Dofile

<AllisZerofuu> AH LOL
<AllisZerofuu> HAHAHA

<NightmareMoon> ...
<prince-dari> O_o?
<TwilightSparkle> Nightmare moon?
<Silvermane> and suddenly NightmareMoon... inb4 foals?
<Apokalipse> unbeatable logic
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mfw saying I don't like durrgarrr is considered a flamewar
<Silvermane> that's not what you said
<Nightshade> looool
<Apokalipse> ololol

<Silvermane> i'd love them...
<Apokalipse> but they look mouldy...
<NightmareMoon> Valthejean well well well, some pony who remembers me.
<Apokalipse> that green is the colour of mould
<Silvermane> i need some wings for my Fluttershy parody LARP char
<Silvermane> (but but but... NightMareMoon... i noticed you first)
<Silvermane> dat penis joke

<Ziltoidia> grope
<Silvermane> oh crap, i still need a tail and ears for that foxman char
<Luna> 7resuming
<Silvermane> Lucifer... wow
<ThunderDash> > An angel
<ThunderDash> > Named Lucifer
<Silvermane> this shit just hit crazy religion reference level
<Apokalipse> dat theme...
<Apokalipse> ...needs more flute
<AllisZerofuu> >three, just stop with the banal shit. I dont mind fanfic, art or the good natured trixie files anything, but some of the posts are just ridiculous. Leaving gryphons out of the poll? what the fuck is this, man?
<ThunderDash> confound you japan, whenever I hear the name Lucifer I always think of umineko
<Ghosties> 4I request Hercules
<AllisZerofuu> Well I just wasted my time taking someone's comments for actual serious complaints.
<Silvermane> AllisZerofuu what?
<AllisZerofuu> Eh it's someone trolling EQD
<Luna> 7Ghosties noted for tomorrow
<AllisZerofuu> I actually thought he had valid points but he really is trolling.
<FreezeFrame> Goes by the blogger name fagbutts
<Silvermane> Lucifer was probably a cool guy in his early years
<Ghosties> 4Hercules is just an amazing show. I didn't realize that until a few years back when Sci Fi showed a marathon all day
<Silvermane> i liked how they showed him growing in strength by having him pick up a horse every day from it's foalhood to adulthood
<Luna> Anyway back on-topic. Should I go ahead and plan the interviews?
<Ghosties> 4Also, another great action series was Mortal Kombat Conquest
<Ghosties> 4But, I'm sure I'm the only one that believes that here >.>
<NightmareMoon> What is this show that which you foals watch as we speak?
<Silvermane> wait... she's going to cause the fall of Lucifer?
<FreezeFrame> Ghosties: Divas of Doom in a tag match.
<Ghosties> Sure. Do you have my availability on hand?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I find it *really* hard to believe Mortal Kombat was a good tv show...but since I haven't seen it I'll give it a chance :P
<Silvermane> It is Xena, oh dark mare of the night
<Ghosties> 4FUCK
<Apokalipse> Mortal Kombat... in non game form? That can't possible be good, can it?
<FreezeFrame> Versus Kelly and Alicia
<TwilightSparkle> Suddenly... fans of Nightmare moon?!
<Ghosties> 4@Apok: It's more common than you think
<Silvermane> I'm not a fan. i'm just not suicidal
<Ghosties> 4And besides, the first film was great too
<Luna> Yes, I do but your availability is a bit late for me. I planned the interviews last round starting at 1:30 and the last interview starting at 3:30
<Silvermane> i mean, i have respect for her...
<FreezeFrame> MK: Defenders of Earth was pretty bad, but it was the enjoyable type of bad.
<Luna> Shall I just go ahead and post them on the forums?
<Ghosties> Well, My availability may actually be changing soon
<Luna> Oh, do tell
<Apokalipse> oh, the enjoyable type of bad
<Apokalipse> that sounds more possible
<Ghosties> But for now, yeah, I'll make the last interview for sure and perhaps some of the one before it
<Ghosties> 4Bleh, a divas match?
<Luna> Great.
<Ghosties> 4BRB bathroom break
<Luna> I'll get on it now
<FreezeFrame> Kelly and Alicia are decent.
<Ghosties> Cool
<FreezeFrame> And Beth and Natty can definitely get a good match out of those two.
<NightmareMoon> Ghosties I hope you drown!
<Ghosties> 4Kelly's like the female Cena
<Silvermane> Xena is causing the fall of Lucifer. She is about to commit the greatest sin I can think of in Christian lore
<Ghosties> 4Wut are you talking about, NightmareMoon?
<Luna> Did you vote on: http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6813944/1/#new?
<Silvermane> (inb4 i get shipped to NMM... scared now)
<Silvermane> another cannibal?
<Ghosties> 4And yeah, Beth and Natty are the best in the diva division at the moment. I just can't wait till Kharma comes back, then the division really will be great again
<Ghosties> Going over them now
<NightmareMoon> Silvermane Your kidding, your kidding right?
<FreezeFrame> That OMG DVD will have the best table power bomb ever.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hah, ic wut u did thar nightmare
<Silvermane> I am sorry NightmareMoon, but it just seems to happen.
<Silvermane> inb4 naked Xena
<Silvermane> drat
<Apokalipse> Secret butt fun
<Silvermane> ^
<Apokalipse> It's coming
<Apokalipse> oh, they cut...
<Apokalipse> damn
<Luna> 7^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 the massage like...paralyzes him or something
<Silvermane> wait, Virgil the poet? as in... THE Virgil?
<Apokalipse> Yeah, I noticed that too
<Silvermane> Virgil and Lucifer? and Mephisto? dear lord
<Silvermane> i want nothing, counter with everything. well why the fuck not
<Apokalipse> makes perfect sense to me
<Ghosties> 4I was a little interested in the OMG DVD, but I'm not gonna get it. If it's just skits and segments, then I'm not gonna buy it.
<Silvermane> wow
<Silvermane> suddenly orgy
<Apokalipse> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> What the hell?
<Pinkie_Pie> Hey Silvermane
<Pinkie_Pie> Reticent not gonna come today?
<Silvermane> wow
<ThunderDash> I went AFK for just a few minutes, get back and... What is going on?
<Apokalipse> this show is so strange
<Silvermane> 14he gets on late sometimes
<Silvermane> 14he started school and has a life now
<Silvermane> 14what a loser... :(
<Apokalipse> Xena. That is all explanation you need
<NightmareMoon> O.o
<ThunderDash> I see.
<Silvermane> i like those 2 things
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<Apokalipse> I like this party
<ValtheJean> 2,14 better to live free in hell than serve in heaven ey Xena?
<Silvermane> Xena seems pretty selfish and, frankly, evil this episode
<Apokalipse> Well there's a hole with evil green jello
<Apokalipse> it corrupted her heart. Or something
<Luna> 7goo!
<Silvermane> well hello fan service
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >implying this entire episode hasn't been fanservice :P
<FreezeFrame> Ghosties: It's sick bumps, too.
<Silvermane> ^
<FreezeFrame> Like Mae Young going through the table.
<FreezeFrame> (The one where she slapped Bubba Ray across the face and told him to stop being a bitch and put her through it)
<NightmareMoon> I don't even know what im watching anymore....
<Silvermane> lol
<Apokalipse> Interesting pause
<ThunderDash> haha
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol sathi, you troll :P
<Silvermane> NightmareMoon stopped stream to talk to us! MFW
<Luna> 7what happend :o
*Silvermane loves Luna but is now really scared
<Apokalipse> so they're german now?
<Silvermane> ^
<Silvermane> Michael?
<Luna> 7suddenly
<Silvermane> Gabrielle?
<Luna> 7party stoppers
<DecapPony> someone stopped the stream to talk to us?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's kinda sad that they're trying to make us sympathize with Lucifer...considering I want the angels to win right now :P
<Silvermane> yes, the NightMareMoon
<Apokalipse> oh no, it knocked her back
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also yeah luna, the stream paused with a NMM soundboard :P
*Luna liked the party before more
<Silvermane> I think they want us to consider that Lucifer's fall isn't all his fault
<Apokalipse> yeah, the party before was nice
*ThunderDash agrees on the party
<Nightshade> JUDO CHOP
<Silvermane> an angel holds the strength of God in his arms, so he should be able to simply break her arm by hitting her weapon
<herospirit> 15OhGogWe'reSoLonely
<Apokalipse> nope, because Xena
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it also depends on the mythology
<TwilightSparkle> Buck her up!
<Silvermane> true, but Arch Angel Lucifer was BAMF
<E_N> Pinkie, i said OP Silver not admin him
<Silvermane> 14lol
<Silvermane> nothing on Michael, but still
<Apokalipse> he should really make up his mind already
<E_N> No offense Silver
<AllisZerofuu> What a manipulative bitch
<Silvermane> 14it's cool, i wouldn't know what to do with it

<Steven_Magnet> 6Silvermare is 1160443961619% sexy.
<Silvermane> 14no favoritism here

<TwilightSparkle> Apokalipse naw to kill Spongebob Squarepants.

<Silvermane> My little pacifist... my little pacifist
<ThunderDash> damn I wish I could jump like that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I really have no idea who I should be rooting for....
<TwilightSparkle> I wish I could slow down time while jumping..
<Apokalipse> me neither really
<Silvermane> i've tried fighting two-handed before. oddly enough i do pretty good with 2 short blades, or a long blade and dagger
<ThunderDash> Val; Me neither, don't worry
<ThunderDash> :P
<FreezeFrame> She doesn't get smote because she's still got to kill the old Greek gods.
<Silvermane> lottery
<Apokalipse> oh snap
<Apokalipse> it was a trap
<TwilightSparkle> uh oh
<AllisZerofuu> http://www.bizchair.com/go-958-bk-gg.html Oh my, what a lovely chair. It's all I wanted!
<Apokalipse> suddenly herpes
<NightmareMoon> *burns it*
<Silvermane> frankly, Lucifer should maintain his visage when he goes satanic
<Apokalipse> He lost the mouldy wings though
<Apokalipse> and got a cooler pair
<ValtheJean> 2,14 angel tries to do his job, becomes the incarnation of evil...and yet apparently the one who corrupted him is the good person...
<Silvermane> yeah...
<Silvermane> Xena is a bitch. fuck her
<Pinkie_Pie> Denied~
<Pinkie_Pie> Admin
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<herospirit> 15I'm still so excited for Fighting is Magic. :0
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<AllisZerofuu> So
<AllisZerofuu> He could fly before
<Silvermane> now now he goes to the 9th layer of hell
<Apokalipse> yes, he does
<Apokalipse> betrayal
<Ghosties> Alright, put my input
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't see the reasoning behind her creating Satan.
<Silvermane> wait, she's free of corruption because she made an arch angel fall?
<TwilightSparkle> Fatality?
<Apokalipse> no, because she closed the evil hole by making an arch angel fall
<Pinkie_Pie> Hero
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wow Xena...just.....just wow.....
<Pinkie_Pie> http://synchtu.be/iBrony
<Apokalipse> which was filled with evil jello
<Nittany_Tiger> What a bitch.
<Silvermane> but... green is a terrible jello flavor
<AllisZerofuu> This might sound slightly sexist but
<herospirit> 15I am admin again.
<Apokalipse> no, it was red at the end
<AllisZerofuu> just as you'd expect from 3dpd!
<Silvermane> mmm red jello
<Silvermane> 3dpd?
<AllisZerofuu> 3d pig disgusting
<Silvermane> ...k?
<AllisZerofuu> I know, I know.
<Silvermane> i don't know what that means
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also if you were serious about the Greek Gods thing, everyone knows Kratos is a better god killer :P
<NightmareMoon> ... well that was...
<Apokalipse> Okay, I should go to sleep now
<Silvermane> lol Kratos, repeating history like a boss.
<Luna> 7interesting to say the least :D

<ThunderDash> ah :P
<Dermathil> it comes in a Smith episode.
<NightmareMoon> *reappears and french kisses silvermane then disappears*
<Nittany_Tiger> WTF?

<DecapPony> and i decided to not run cause im too drunk
<Dermathil> this is awesome
<PrincessMolestia> 13Oh yeah.
<prince-dari> INB4 Pinkie Pie Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Dermathil> since I think that is the actual 5th doctor actor
<DecapPony> btw your out of roofies PrincessMolestia
*PrincessMolestia 13takes Silvermane into another room where many horrible sounds are heard from outside
<DecapPony> also can i have my sword back?
<prince-dari> Lawl
<PrincessMolestia> 13Must get moar!
<DecapPony> listen if i get my sword back i PROMISE i wont kill or dismember anyone
<PrincessMolestia> 13Silly Decap, swords dont go there.
*SilverMane wonders what the cloth shackles on the wall are for, and why his wings are so tickley.
<DecapPony> but i will harvest them for their organs
<Dermathil> >mfw JOHN SMITH
<Dermathil> wow......
<DecapPony> btw PrincessMolestia i need to give your liver to Silvermane so i can go and sell his liver on the black market
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so then why doesn't tennant remember THIS happening to him if this was a previous doctor?
<Dermathil> Tennant remembers
<Dermathil> but this doctor doesn't
<prince-dari> Blink!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hahaha...
<DecapPony> you dont need your liver do you PrincessMolestia?
<Dermathil> This is Tennant's 2nd time in this video
<Denied_Existence> G'night
*PrincessMolestia 13's live is no good from too many room parties with "Special" guests
<Dermathil> The older doctor will then remember this event when he becomes Tennant
<PrincessMolestia> 13*liver
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but what I'm saying is, tennant should remember being the 5th doctor here in this particular event. So why would he ask him about blink if that hasn't happened to 5th doctor?
<Dermathil> OHSHIT
<DecapPony> fuck it
<Dermathil> BOTH DOCTORS
<DecapPony> ill just give Silver's back to him
<Dermathil> AND BOTH CYBERMEN MODELS
*SilverMane wonders why he can't bring his wings down and why PrincessMolestia left him in cloth shackles on the wall. "What do birds have to do with this? Is it because I'm a pegasus? I don't get it."
<SilverMane> i'm too drunk for this
*DecapPony goes into the room with a knife and a cooler, screams of agony are heard,
*PrincessMolestia 13thinks Silvermane makes a cute wall decoration
*DecapPony comes back out covered in blood
<PrincessMolestia> 13:D
<DecapPony> well all done
<DecapPony> now can i learn about the birds and the bees?
<SilverMane> PrincessMolestia ;) You know my kink too well
<PrincessMolestia> 13Decap got into the ketchup again :|
<DecapPony> also i stole all of your stuff
<PrincessMolestia> 13My bondage gear!
<PrincessMolestia> 13And he took my favorite whip too
<DecapPony> nah, i left that, but i stole that dude that was chaine to your wall
<ValtheJean> 2,14 O_o
<PrincessMolestia> 13And... oh dear, I wont even mention that...
<Dermathil> Molestia: Your little wingboner kit (by Cereal_Velocity)
<SilverMane> At least he left the silk. It really makes the long-lived bindings more comfortable
<PrincessMolestia> 13Oh, him. He had the best lesson of his life, so he was all set.
<DecapPony> his organs should sell for a good price
<Dermathil> lol companion
<Dermathil> (DecapPony, a Timelord has 2 hearts)
*SilverMane is glad he didn't mention his whip in his closet...
<DecapPony> anyway what were you going to tell me about the birds and the bees?
<SilverMane> night Razyn
<DecapPony> but first
*DecapPony passes out
<TwilightSparkle> Did I miss anything?
*PrincessMolestia 13teaches Decap about "physical education"
<Kencolt706> NOPONY TOLD ME THEY SHOWED DOCTOR WHO HERE! WAHHHHHH!
*DecapPony wakes up
<Dashite> Well now you know!
<DecapPony> huh chained to a wall
<SilverMane> Well, TwilightSparkle, your mentor has me tied up in her private chambers and her bondage gear was stolen. Besides that, not much
<Dashite> We also show House in the afternoons.
<Dermathil> welcome Kencolt
<Dermathil> hahahaha
<DecapPony> ive been through worse
<prince-dari> We show all sorts of stuff here.
<DecapPony> unless the pony mafia is here
<PrincessMolestia> 13I'm sure you have ;)
<Dermathil> Dari is british
<Dashite> ^ That's a lie
<DecapPony> wait the pony mafia arent here are they?
<Dashite> His accent is totally fake
<PrincessMolestia> 13He wears a top hat and monocle and sips tea all the time, true story.
<DecapPony> cause then im glad i had that shotgun put in my bionic hoof
<DecapPony> im just glad that i was able to get one, makes up for not knowing magic, or having wings
<Dermathil> DELETE DELETE DELETE
<DecapPony> wait, am i covered in wax?
<TwilightSparkle> Princess you mind letting go of silvermane?
<Kencolt706> Somehow, this does not seem the best possible defense technique...
<DecapPony> i already got him off of the wall TwilighSparkle
<DecapPony> but now Silver and i are both up here
<DecapPony> and im completely sober :'(
<Suffuri> so wazzup
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hello suffuri
<SilverMane> PrincessMolestia, can you let me go? my fillyfriend is upset that I'm faking-banging deities on the side... unless you want to bring MirthTinker up here..."
<Suffuri> It's my old nemesis, Val!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wait...what?
<Dermathil> >mfw I checked the Doctor Who wiki and this episode is the 2008 special
<DecapPony> and can you get me some vodka?
<Suffuri> the gray background is nice.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 thanks :P
<DecapPony> there is some wierd taste stuck in my mouth
<Suffuri> my music turned on
<Suffuri> so i looked at my fan thinking it got stuck
<CutieMarkCrusaders> CUTIE MARK CRUSADER CHATTING YAY!
<Kencolt706> WHY, WHy, WHY is there always some Earthperson who just does NOT get the idea that co-operating with the alien invaders who want to kill/mutate/recostruct everyone else is a bad idea?
<Dermathil> >mfw the episode's plot is entirely different from what I thought it was
<Dermathil> Kencolt: they want to save their asses
<SilverMane> CutieMarkCrusaders? Wasn't someone shipping me with them after a time-travel incident?
<Kencolt706> No.. they always seem to think they will profit. If there is anyone I can't love and tolerate, it's the moroonic collaborators in a Dr. WHo episode.
<Dashite> Yes, yes they were.
<DecapPony> Silvermane is it me or do you smell burnt flesh?
<CutieMarkCrusaders> No. I don't know. Never!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well kencolt, they don't have the luxury of being an audience member :P they don't see all the hundreds of times that fails :P
<SilverMane> I smell... food
*DecapPony looks at side and sees a bloody bandage
<prince-dari> I wish I did.
<prince-dari> XD
<DecapPony> aww shit
<prince-dari> Old timey TARDIS
<Kencolt706> I personally would think that it was obvious...
<Dermathil> lawl
<Dermathil> and he figured it out
<Kencolt706> HAHAHAHAHA! TARDIS!
*DecapPony looks over at SilverMane's side
<DecapPony> SilverMane you have a brand on you
<Kencolt706> So, can anypony give me a quick rundown on what happened before?
<CutieMarkCrusaders> ummmmmmmmmmm
<Kencolt706> IN THE EPISODE.
<SilverMane> I have a brand. Huh. Well, at least now there is always an explanation for why i'm a bitch
<DecapPony> you know what though, these cuffs are fairly comfortable
<SilverMane> Yeah, genuine silk is like that. Probably spider silk, judging by the give
<DecapPony> anyways, you want to get out of here?
<SilverMane> Eh, I'm good. She lost her whip, so she has to work manually now.
<DecapPony> i always have my straight razor with me, i could probably get us out of here
<DecapPony> are you sure?
<DecapPony> what about your filliefriend?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 haha...he had the entire doctor who series downloaded into his brain :P
<Dermathil> THE ONE AND THE ONLY
<PrincessMolestia> 13Hmm, Want You Gone isnt bad. Sounds a lot like another Portal-esque song I know of...
<SilverMane> it is a portal song
<Kencolt706> Half a doctor? Hey-- there's hope, we have one and a half Doctors here!
<DecapPony> Molestia why is there a bandage on my and why is there this strange taste in my mouth?
<DecapPony> * me
<SilverMane> DecapPony, I'm sure Tinkerbelle will come find me soon enough. MirthTinker is a smart filly
<MirthTinker> say what?
<PrincessMolestia> 13Its based off the Portal song, but its not the Portal song itself. :P
<DecapPony> also what happened to the straight razor i kept in my mouth?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol...I still haven't played Portal 2
<Dermathil> GO PLAY IT
<Dermathil> AND MAKE YOUR ELITISM EVAPORATE
<MirthTinker> oh...yeah, I planted a tracking chip on your rump while you were doped up on cola once, Mr.Peddington knows where you are at all times SilverMane
<PrincessMolestia> 13That signifies a happy night Decap :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't have it
<Suffuri> hrmm
<SilverMane> ... MirthTinker, is that why you gave up on span- umm started playing nice?
<CutieMarkCrusaders> Happy night Happy happy happy HAPPY!
<DecapPony> are you sure?
<Suffuri> my keyboard is off.
<Suffuri> this combinatorics is decent,.
<Dermathil> lawl Val.
<DecapPony> cause my junk really hurts
<Dermathil> I thought you meant you had Portal 2 yet hadn't played it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah, sorry for that then
<Dermathil> Valthejean, is Metro 2033 a game you like?
<MirthTinker> Span...-ish? I've never been to Europe
<Kencolt706> Steampunk cybermen? What next?
<Suffuri> or mexico i guess
<ValtheJean> 2,14 never even heard of it derma
<Dermathil> ah
<DecapPony> hai MirthTinker
<Dermathil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033
<Dermathil> look it up, Val.
<SilverMane> oh you MirthTinker. so silly
<Dermathil> and of shit They will NOT Cybermanize the kiddos.
<Kencolt706> ]They would cyberize pulppies if it would serve-- wait, I think they did.
<DecapPony> MirthTinker can you get SilverMane and I down from here before PrincessMolestia comes back?
<SilverMane> DRAWFRIEND TIME
<Suffuri> drawfienddddd
<Suffuri> yay
<SilverMane> it was a big meh
<MirthTinker> nope...I'm going to bed, you'll live till morning right? :P
<DecapPony> i might, but idk about SilverMane
<PrincessMolestia> 13Molestia is a bit busy, so shes kinda here and kinda not. :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13Especially now with Drawfriend. lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 have a good night mirthtinker
<DecapPony> although i did steal most of PrincessMolestia's stuff so....
<TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie> I Trixie have arrived.
<Kencolt706> I LIKE that girl.
<ThunderDash> *PAWNCH*
<Kencolt706> She got pwnied.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hello thegreatandpowerfultrixie
<DecapPony> trixie dont go to any parties PrincessMolestia invites you to
<TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie> Hello Val.
<DecapPony> you will wake up chained to a wall
<SilverMane> The Great and Powerful Trixie? Come aid the Mighty and Magnificent Silvermane! And perhaps you can enjoy the bindings i find myself in, yourself ;)
<Dashite> Hey Trixie. Your name is way too long.
<mib_ll8h56> why isn't /nick working
<DecapPony> aw fuck it
<mib_ll8h56> why isn't slash nick working
<Dashite> Nick changes are disabled.

<Suffuri> dodododdododooooo
<TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie> Silvermane hmmm maybe.

<Kencolt706> Oh, how deeply I hate this lady now...
<SilverMane> I'll make it worth your while
<Kencolt706> Designated a lie... HAH!
<DecapPony> i can too, and ill give you some of the stuff i stole from Molestia!
<Kencolt706> You know, this actually can only be an improvement.
<Dermathil> dat oversized steam engine
<TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie> Silvermane asked first so I assist HIM first.
<SilverMane> ;
<SilverMane> ;)
<Suffuri> Hammerfight
<Kencolt706> Okay... I was wrong. She's WORSE...
<Suffuri> destroying my Colussus then not giving me my cash to buy another :/
<Kencolt706> A angry Cyberman would make a Dalek look like a cuddly bunny.
<Dermathil> nah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 suddenly wants to be the cyberking
<Dermathil> a dalek could fall a million cybermen
<TwilightSparkle> zzzzzzz
<Kencolt706> Historicaly, Daleks and cybermen were -- in combat-- on a par.
<Suffuri> last night
*SilverMane realizes that no one is creating Twixie shipping. How else will Baby Midnight get born?
<CAJ> am I the only one who keeps thinking they are saying Saibamen
<Dermathil> maybe, Kencolt. But only because the cybermen had numbers.
<Suffuri> level 10 of dungeons of dredmor, I got impatient and accidently walked into my 3x3 of infinite deadthings
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol Caj, well NOW I am :P
<Kencolt706> Yes. yes, you are.
<TrollightSparkle> Hey guise
<Suffuri> and promptly died on the last level with permadeath on.
<DecapPony> TwilightSparkle can you help me down from these chains that your master put me into?
<Dermathil> Daleks are elite soldiers. Cybermen are faceless armies of soldiers
<SilverMane> TwilightSparkle and TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie, this can only end well.
<CAJ> also ValtheJean someone like... pulled me into a seperate chat today and was asking what I thought about you
<Dermathil> >mfw THE SON
<SilverMane> CAJ, you so silly
<Kencolt706> It kind of evens out.
<CAJ> but I r teh SRS
<prince-dari> Dat Captain Jack
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well whatever the case, I think it's best we not discuss such things ;)
<TwilightSparkle> DecapPony oh sure *uses magic on the chains and shatter them*
<Dermathil> exactly Kencolt. But Only because the Cybermen have numbers.
<CAJ> I just told them I didn't know who you were, but now I know. So yay.
<Kencolt706> That and Cyberweaponry is on a par. And until recently, they had a major advantage.
<DecapPony> thanks
<CAJ> Anyway, you seem nice enough, so eeeyup.
<Kencolt706> They could climb stairs. Took YEARS for the daleks to figure that one out.
*DecapPony gives TwilightSparkle a BDSM whip
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<DecapPony> i stole this from your teacher's closet

<Kencolt706> Oh, even better- STEAMPUNK MECHA!
<Dashite> Emotes are /me
<DecapPony> its ok
<SilverMane> Suffuri, i honestly didn't like it that much today. Wasn't anything that impressed me

<TwilightSparkle> you to val
<CAJ> ValtheJean: all you need to know is EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE
<Suffuri> 0the Aku one from Samurai Jack was nice.
<TwilightSparkle> Yeah what ever
<Kencolt706> Delete seems to work too...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, now let's see how cybermen/daleks hold against replicators :P
<prince-dari> Meh, replicators can't touch daleks.
<prince-dari> Epic shields. :P
<DecapPony> hey Silvermane you want to go get some booze?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 except that replicators eat through shields like butter :P
<prince-dari> Not dalek shields.
<Dermathil> >yfw the daleks were in war with the time lords
<Suffuri> 0stargate/dr who crossover?

<DecapPony> well im off to steal more stuff
<Kencolt706> One HELL of a flintlock.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the Asgard would still kick all ass :P
<prince-dari> Not Time Lords. :P
<prince-dari> Well, maybe Time Lords.
*DecapPony vanishes into thin air infront of the bed
<prince-dari> But not the Doctor.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<prince-dari> Doctor > All
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Thor > All
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it seems we are at an impass :P
<prince-dari> Even death, and the devil.
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> (The doctor Did trap an entire planet in between the folds of spacetime)
<SilverMane> peh, thor
<Kencolt706> I can only think of one person in all fiction who COULD beat the doctor...
<Dermathil> Val, I watched Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis.
<CAJ> Kencolt706: batman?
<prince-dari> Lolz.
<Dermathil> I can say with confidence that the Doctor is the better.
<prince-dari> If you mention Atlantis people will rage most likely.
<Jayne_Cobb> squirrel girl?
<Dermathil> (I know dari. That's the goal)
<lyra> is val here?
<CAJ> Jayne_Cobb: YES
<Kencolt706> No. Ranma Saotome. Who would listen to his usual speil-- and then just punch in inna face anyhow.
<prince-dari> XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Thor managed to outsmart the demi-god anubis with ancient technology, your argument is invalid

<SilverMane> lyra, zomg wtf was taht? silly
<prince-dari> The Doctor destroyed the entirety of the two most powerful species in existence (and out of it).
<prince-dari> Your arguement is invalid
*DecapPony gives SilverMane his wallet back

<ValtheJean> 2,14 can you copy/paste messages with it DCD?
<ValtheJean>  Because if so, I might have a solution for you
<ValtheJean> 2,14 whoopsie
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> I want a Droid but they're too expensive over here
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> Got this cause it's affordable
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> Also all data throttling in this country is terribad except for BBs, cause everyone has one here
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> Val: it has no Ctrl Key though. I'm guessing you meant Ctrl + K?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 for the first part, yes. But if you have any way of copying a message and pasting it I think we can get it to work
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> yeah I have ways to do so....just not in-client
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> I can paste stuff into my text input but I can't copy text from the channel, pour example
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not in client then? Damn...
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> wait lemme try something
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> @11
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> @11 I am Gendum
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> Bleh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :- /
<MobilePhoneSuiteDCD> Gonna keep trying
<lyra> ./)*3*(\
<ThunderDash> Alright, I think I'm out for tonight, planning on showing up tomorrow
<ThunderDash> Night, everypony :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Have a good night Thunderdash
<lyra> later mate
<ValtheJean> 2,14Have any luck yet DCD?
<NewDCD> nope
<Sumica> woops, guess i idled too long
<ValtheJean> 2,14 happens :P
<Sumica> Forgot I was in here after the sound cut out.
<ValtheJean> 2,14Haha, when the stream dies so does chat apparently :P
<Sumica> Shame that, but seeing as the odd hours the mods keep here it's bound to happen.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh well
<Sumica> So you gonna be a streamer too now Val?
<ValtheJean> 2,14I can't promise anything, as it hasn't been discussed at all. For now at least, it's looking like "no".
<ValtheJean> 2,14With that being said, anything can change
<Sumica> No worries, was just wondering as they seem to still be looking for S2 streamers/mods.
<ValtheJean> 2,14Fair enough
<NewDCD> Sumica, we are
<NewDCD> both positions are not mutually inclusive, though
<NewDCD> you can be a streamer but maybe you don't pass the mod interview, or a mod cause your hardware can't handle streaming. And so on.
<NewDCD> were you wishing to apply for a streamer position?
<Sumica> Not sure if i have the horsepower needed to stream, my down pipe is fine but my upload is low.
<NewDCD> how low is your UL?
<Sumica> 1-2 iirc
<NewDCD> higher than mine
<NewDCD> I have 0.99 Mbps
<NewDCD> and I stream just fine
<NewDCD> it's a matter of technique
<NewDCD> in any case, check http://speedtest.net
<NewDCD> what's your UL?
<Sumica> showing .7 on that, I think I need to call my isp and see if they are running network test again.
<NewDCD> .7 is good enough
<NewDCD> you need .614 for an HQ stream
<NewDCD> do you have a capture card by any chance?
<Sumica> yeah.
<NewDCD> you DO?
<NewDCD> and The Hub?
<Sumica> Need to set it back up, migrated to a Procc and HD so did't set it all back up
<Sumica> heh yeah got the hub, went out and upgrade to digital cable just for that =p
<NewDCD> still a capture card is a capture card
<NewDCD> You just might be the candidate who can provide the best quality
<NewDCD> What are your CPU/RAM Specs?
<Sumica> 4gig ddr3 dont recall the speed on it. clock is a 4 core checking dx to get the specs.
<NewDCD> ...Yeah
<NewDCD> it should run just fine
<NewDCD> you're pretty much hired by now if you want to be a streamer
<NewDCD> all that's left is testing the stream tomorrow and training you
<NewDCD> I'll be available from 10 AM EST to 4 PM EST
<NewDCD> will you be around then?
<Sumica> Sadly I have work tomorrow , I can set it up thur and test it friday if that works for yah.
<NewDCD> damn
<NewDCD> till what time do you work?
<NewDCD> also, what do we know of the S2 schedule? Will it actually be running on Saturdays? Cause I'm guessing that's just a premiere sort of thing
<ValtheJean> 2,14I have no idea, let me see if I can dig up some info
<Sumica> double shift, ass crack of dawn till around noon then come back at 4 till midnight.
<Sumica> saterday the 17th at 8am
<Sumica> is the first run of the show
<Sumica> then again at 6pm iirc
<Sumica> PST
<ValtheJean> 2,14Oh nice (this is totally random) but they added Batman the Animated series to their Fall schedule
<NewDCD> cause if you have to work during stream time...if you have no qualms with Remote Access, we can use TeamViewer and I could handle your streaming from my comp
<NewDCD> holy shit Val that is rad
<NewDCD> Sumica, so from Noon to 4, you won't be available?
<Sumica> I dont mind assumeing we can get it running. My system has had issues before with setting up direct conections. At least so far as gaming goes.
<NewDCD> Roger that
<DecapPony> im back
<ValtheJean> 2,14wb decappony
<Sumica> noon to 4 pm pst Iwill be off work but travle time and geting lunch I probaly will not be online.
<NewDCD> ah, I see
<NewDCD> hey Decap
<DecapPony> hey
<ValtheJean> 2,14hmmmm
<Sumica> I could probably do a test thursday evening assuming I get the capture card and such back up
<NewDCD> will you be available anywhere around 10 AM and 4PM EST tomorrow?
<ValtheJean> 2,14it may actually be a saturday new episode thing
<ValtheJean> http://www.nickandmore.com/2011/08/23/the-hubs-fall-schedule-first-look-batman-the-animated-series-goosebumps-join/
<Sumica> have to put the card in the case and reinstall software.
<NewDCD> Sumica: we need to test FME in your PC first though. For that, we don't need the capture card just yet
<ValtheJean> 2,14 at the bottom it has the lineup starting september 6th
<Sumica> ah oki
<NewDCD> Val: feels badman ;___; Saturdays are terribad for me
<NewDCD> Also is it 8 AM EST?
<Sumica> I belive the times on the site saif pst
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's a good question...I have no idea
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also I feel your pain DCD :(
<Sumica> want me to just check the guide on my cable?
<NewDCD> please do
<NewDCD> confound these ponies
<NewDCD> they drive me to waking up early on the only day I can sleep in
<DecapPony> http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/240/d/5/herpmit_crab_by_zicygomar-d486goa.png
<DecapPony> i already have my dvr set up to record the new episodes
<DecapPony> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9etPQYpFgx0/Tls9178hE_I/AAAAAAAAB6E/47cnfBwXOEg/s400/meet_the_cluster_by_lifesequencebreak-d47zfio.png
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's looking like at the moment they don't have the specifics that far...I wonder if the ponychan thread about S2 might know more
<Sumica> feh, the schudule onle goes up 9-5
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DecapPony: Fuggin saved
<NewDCD> Val, please investigate for me
<NewDCD> Decap: what about S2 streaming? When streaming, FME can record your video stream as well
<PrincessMolestia> 13It costs me 400,000 bits to play my cello for 12 seconds...
<DecapPony> yeah i need to go and get a capture card first
<ValtheJean> 2,14Haha o u molestia :P
<Sumica> same with the one on Hubs site.
<DecapPony> lol @ PrincessMolestia
<Dashite> You mean it costs other people 400,000 bits to hear you play your cello for 12 seconds...
<NewDCD> getting easycap is the economic option
<NewDCD> But we got to test well if you can stream, first
<NewDCD> So let's test that tomorrow
<ValtheJean> 2,14"FLUTTERSHY! ARE YOU SURE DIS WILL VERK?"....."I have NO IDEA!"
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol Correct Dashite!
<Sumica> Hi Octivia
<NewDCD> so considering how things look at the moment...we have Sumica as the possible mane streamer, GGgala passed the examination and is getting easyCap, and Decap is a promising candidate
<DecapPony> it cost 1,000 bits per second to use my machete
<Sumica> If you want to test what ever it is you want to test with out capture gear we can try it now NewDCD
<NewDCD> Sumica: I can't though LOL gotta sleep, got 5 hours to sleep left
<PrincessMolestia> 13Hey Octivia? Am I suddenly a healthy dairy product?
<NewDCD> wait
<ValtheJean> 2,14Ouch DCD! Get some sleep ya foo!
<DecapPony> HAI OCTAVIA!
<Sumica> Thought it was Activia
<NewDCD> Who's Molestia again?
<ValtheJean> 2,14That would be octavia :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13Hey Decap
<PrincessMolestia> 13Thats me DCD ;)
<DecapPony> ow i just cut my hand open....'
<NewDCD> well if Sathi or Dari or even Sprinks get online
<DecapPony> eh it will be fine
<PrincessMolestia> 13Darnit Val, you ruined the surprise. lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14<.< >.>
<PrincessMolestia> 13Well, with everyone shouting my name... lol
<Sumica> it's like cinamax, after 3am octavia turns in to PrincessMolestia.
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14I don't know about sprinks, but sathi and dari will be out for a while
<NewDCD> tell them to come and set up Sumica for an FME Stream Test
<ValtheJean> 2,14Dari just went to bed...say...40 minutes ago?
<ValtheJean> 2,14That we can do :P
<NewDCD> in any case
<NewDCD> Sumica, yours is an HD Capture Card, ja?
<GenocidePony> well its after 10pm....
<GenocidePony> so i turn into GenocidePony!
<NewDCD> maybe we could go full retard and have an HD Quality, an SD HQ Stream and an SD LQ Stream
<Sumica> negitive, I was checking prices on them as we talking though
<ValtheJean> 2,14That'd be pretty ballin
<Sumica> seems I can get an HD capture card from frys for around 40ish so I might just do that between shifts.
<NewDCD> ah, but Sumica
<NewDCD> I thought you already had a capture card?
<Sumica> I do, it's just not HD =p
<NewDCD> I see. Well, don't purchase anything till we run the tests that determine whether your comp can handle FME, kay?
<NewDCD> kay I really should go sleep now LOL
<NewDCD> Night erryponi
<ValtheJean> 2,14sleep well dcd
<ValtheJean> 2,14dream of many fighting robots :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14with ponies piloting them :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13Night DCD
<DecapKing> see yeah DCD
<ValtheJean> 2,14You know, sometimes I wonder if Dari really sleeps, or if he actually just stalks the chat. That script is mighty unsettling at times :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13I bet your computer will probably be able to handle FME fine though. If its got 4 gigs ddr3 ram and a quad core.
<Sumica> will do
<ValtheJean> 2,14Yeah, though it's better to be safe than sorry
<ValtheJean> 2,14After all, we wouldn't want anyone spending money only to find out *something* doesn't work
<PrincessMolestia> 13Oh it will. lol
<PrincessMolestia> 13Unless there some software bug that messes with FME
<DecapKing> i can run FME and only have CPU usage at 20 to 30%
<Sumica> well I would still use the card. I watch shows on my psp on breaks
<PrincessMolestia> 13I can run FME like a champ and I've only got a quad with ddr ram
<PrincessMolestia> 13*ddr2 ram
<ValtheJean> 2,14Well, what if trollestia planted his computer with anti-pony streaming viruses? :P
<DecapKing> i bet no one knows who i am
<Sumica> well that or I jack bluetooth projectors in the conference rooms and play pony videos on them to troll the stuffed suit guys.
<ValtheJean> 2,14Indeed, who could this mysterious Decapking be? :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol Nope, not at all Decap :P
<DecapKing> well im xxHeadremoverxx
<PrincessMolestia> 13Playing ponies on all the bluetooth projectors would be pretty cool :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14Plus you'd be giving your office the gift of ponies :P
<DecapKing> is there any better gift?
<Sumica> it's kinda amusing just for the shock value.
<ValtheJean> 2,14None that I can think of my friend :P
<DecapKing> at least outside of PrincessMolestia's world
<PrincessMolestia> 13;)
<Sumica> Seeing as the guys that set up the projectores know noting about secureing bluetooth connections.
*PrincessMolestia 13gives the best gifts
<ValtheJean> 2,14>mfw S2's pilot episode is just this orgasmic mayhem of everything we've been hoping for
<DecapKing> right molestia, like a brand is a good gift?
<DecapKing> although you did let me go and steal all of your stuff
*PrincessMolestia 13gives the gift of "friendship". The best gift there is, right? :D
<Sumica> heres hopeing ValtheJean, I just fear every one is geting them selves too excited over it and noting can ever meet our wildist expatations.
<ValtheJean> 2,14Only if there's ponie's invo.....wait....OH GOD NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
<ValtheJean> 2,14Well, I'll be satisfied if they keep a consistent quality as season 1
<Sumica> indeed.
<ValtheJean> 2,14everything else is just icing on the cake
<ValtheJean> 2,14of course, if that bitch Trixie makes even ONE appearance I'll blow a gasket
<DecapKing> from now on after 10pm i become DecapKing, cause Octavia can become a fucking princess.....
<Sumica> ....I just realized something. We went from my just making conversation about you getting to stream or not to oh hey I might be streaming S2 =p
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
*PrincessMolestia 13has a feeling Trixie will indeed make another appearance
<ValtheJean> 2,14Well honestly that's a good thing :P
*DecapKing agrees with the princess
<Sumica> They already said she would PrincessMolestia.
<ValtheJean> 2,14I didn't even realize you were interested in streaming. I'm glad that DCD asked :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13Did they finally confirm it?
<ValtheJean> 2,14Sumica: Link or it didn't happen
<DecapKing> SHOW US ZE LINK!
<PrincessMolestia> 13I saw someone say vaguely, but it wasnt an actual confirmation.
<ValtheJean> 2,14/me prepares his Impaling Trident to charge the Hasbro building
<Sumica> feh, hold on let me go dig back thru that interview.
<ValtheJean> 2,14lame...apparently color doesn't work with /me
<DecapKing> nope
<Dashite> Val you lier!
<DecapKing> .avi
<ValtheJean> 2,14at least, on mIRC
<Dashite> I thought you said you gave up the trident!
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14And I also said that I sleep with it at night because it makes me feel safe :P
<DecapKing> i thought Molestia said she gave up her special
<Sumica> You know they conform noting but hint at everything =p
<DecapKing> 'parties
<PrincessMolestia> 13Well, I have a friend on the show, and I know some things others dont. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14O_o
<ValtheJean> 2,14*Rarity Voice* TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME!
<Dashite> Molestia... did you know that you were my favourite mod?
<ValtheJean> 2,14But seriously, if Trixie reappears in S2...dear god there will be no stopping my impaling spree
<DecapKing> TELL ME OR YOU WILL BE WHIPPED!
<Dashite> And by were, I of course mean are.
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol I cant Val. And anything I can a little, I hint at in my comments on EqD once in a while when its appropriate. :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol Dashite :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14I liked you better when you were Octavia, Octavia would tell me these things :P
*PrincessMolestia 13likes to be whipped though
<DecapKing> yeah but molestia is more fun
<Sumica> eqd news tag is useless.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Octavia would just shy away like Fluttershy. :P
<DecapKing> THEN YOU WILL NOT BE WHIPPED UNTIL YOU TELL ME!
<ValtheJean> 2,14Molestia, I will track you down and find where you live!
<ValtheJean> 2,14And then I'll make you tell me!
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol Oh Val, you stalker, you. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14What can I say? I like watching people :P
<Dashite> I dunno if Octavia would shy away. Octavia is like franziska von karma. She's not taking any of your shit.
<DecapKing> unfortunately for you she likes that kind of thing
<PrincessMolestia> 13Ah, I think I know what you mean Sumica. Since I see all the EqD posts.
<PrincessMolestia> 13It was a hint, vaguely, but not a confirmation really. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14On an unrelated note...English classes are the best
<DecapKing> FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<ValtheJean> 2,14First assignment? Read Beowulf: Me gusta
<DecapKing> math is better
<ValtheJean> 2,14Of course...I've already read it...but hey I like it enough to reread it :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13Bueno
<DecapKing> 2 minutes to do the assignments
<ValtheJean> 2,14Phffff, math can suck it :P
<DecapKing> THIS CALLS FOR A BATTLE!
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
<Dashite> DecapKing: Strategic Management was way better. One assignment all semester. Aww yeah.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Battle of The Subjects
<ValtheJean> 2,14Lol, that would be quite the battle
<DecapKing> FOR MY WEAPON, I CHOSE MOLESTIA!
<ValtheJean> 2,14Sorry Decap. You can't. Unfortunately you can't speak to anyone without english :P
<DecapKing> binary
<DecapKing> sign language
<DecapKing> russia
<DecapKing> *russian
<DecapKing> chinese
<DecapKing> japanese
<DecapKing> german
<DecapKing> spanish
<ValtheJean> 2,14>Implying you know all of those
<ValtheJean> 2,14>and further implying that you get to bring other fields with you
<ValtheJean> 2,14Also, binary is useless if you have no language to translate it
<ValtheJean> 2,14mwahahaha! I win :P
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
<DecapKing> if we didnt have math there wouldnt be any internet
<Sumica> *grumbles* oki I must have just had a moment of insanity cause I cant find the damn EqD post.
<PrincessMolestia> 13Its okay Sumica, I think I know the one you mean anyway.
<PrincessMolestia> 13I dont miss any EqD posts :P
<Sumica> I am sure i saw such a post it went to some comments over on tumbler or what ever the hell it is.
*ValtheJean still hates the thought of a trixie reappearance
<ValtheJean> 2,14But if she does reappear...I am litterally going to track Sethisto down and impale him personally
*DecapKing DEMANDS MORE BIG MAC!
*PrincessMolestia 13thinks about a Trixie reappearance
<Sumica> but I cant seem to find it now and i went back as far as the 30million post stuff.
<PrincessMolestia> 13imokaywiththis.jpg
<Dashite> Trixie X Twilight in season 2. :)
*ValtheJean slaps Dashite
*Dashite slaps ValtheJean around with a bit of a large trout!
<PrincessMolestia> 13>yfw Molestia becomes canon
<Sumica> but that would be incest, they are sisters after all =p
<ValtheJean> 2,14My slap came first, so I win :P
<DecapKing> id be ok with molestia becoming canon
<PrincessMolestia> 13I just love the face people gave Molestia. lol

<Daz> Sup prince-dari. How's you?
<prince-dari> Good thanks.
<prince-dari> You?
<Daz> Just woke up, got a great day lined up for myself today, so i'm good too
<Daz> light up mcdonalds pony toys? haha
<Daz> Wrek, any news on when part 5 of 'through the eyes of another pony' will be out?
<Daz> yay~ roundup
<Daz> ponycountdown dot com =D
<prince-dari> Hey RobotPinkie
<Daz> RobotPinkie just joined?
<RobotPinkie> Hey prince-dari
<RobotPinkie> hey Daz
<Daz> Sup
<RobotPinkie> I had such a spectacularly crappy first half of the day
<RobotPinkie> but then I found a toy store that sells blind bag ponies!
<prince-dari> Wait
<prince-dari> In America?
<RobotPinkie> in Sweden :P
<Daz> nope swed- aw ninja'd
<prince-dari> Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
<Daz> ...BLINDBAGS?!?!?!?!
<prince-dari> I thought they were only in Germany?
<Daz> wantwantwant
<RobotPinkie> I got 3
<prince-dari> :( Everywhere but UK
*prince-dari cries
<Daz> Spain too, prince-dari :(
<RobotPinkie> no doubles, and one of them was mane 6 :3
*Daz lowers his head
<RobotPinkie> I'm sorry :(
<prince-dari> You know you can check the numbers to know which pony you're getting.
<RobotPinkie> They didn't have them two weeks ago, though, I just checked because I was in the area
<RobotPinkie> ...you can?
<RobotPinkie> Which numbers? :o
<Daz> I don't even HAVE 4 technically. just those 2 sets, and the show's /now/ /under/ /way/ in Italy, but not here yet D:
<Daz> RobotPinkie: OMGAGAD get no.3!
<Daz> as you can see, no.3 is RD
<Daz> aaaaaand yes, fffuuuu Fluttershy
<RobotPinkie> AHA!
<RobotPinkie> holy fuck I'm going back there tomorrow, then
<Daz> "French Giggle at the Ghostly Apparently Pinkie Pie says "Tease the Zombies" and revenants/vampires in this one, which is actually really awesome. I hope there are revenants, zombies, and vampires coming up! Halloween Special anyone? You can find it here! "
<Daz> Y U NO LINK MEEEEEEE
<Daz> (the 'here' isn't linked) :(
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Daz> also RobotPinkie every box contains one of every pony
<Daz> if you got the money, ask to go out back and buy an unopened box
<RobotPinkie> wai Daz?
<Daz> wai. well, according to something i read bfore
<RobotPinkie> Oh...
<RobotPinkie> So no doubles in any one box?
<Daz> that's what it said...just finding it now
<RobotPinkie> because then I'm definitely doing that...
<Daz> haha
<Daz> yea just looking for that post
<RobotPinkie> lol I only have 5 molded ponies, so...
<Daz> "If you want all 24, I have heard rumors that if you buy a box rather than individual bags, the box will contain all 24 ponies. It is a rumor though, so don't get upset if you buy a box and end up with duplicates. " there's more somewhere thou lemme keep looking
<Daz> there is more somewhere, lemme keep googl'ing
<RobotPinkie> lol I can't find it either
<Daz> : /.
<Daz> still looking thou, for myself too ; )
<RobotPinkie> otherwise I'll just have to go look at the numbers until I catch 'em all :P
<Daz> "In a blind bag box, this is true because there is one of each pony and they are equal. "
<Daz> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/merch/res/34422.html
<Daz> hmm
<Daz> hey RobotPinkie be sure to see how many blindbags there ARE in a box. if there's 24 bags, and you look at the numbers, and see like '1 2 3 4' etc then BUY A BOX FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA
<Daz> :P
<Daz> that's how i've decided i'm gonna do it. look at the numbers on an opened box, and if so, ask to go out back for an unopened one. :P
<RobotPinkie> It seems like 24 would be a reasonable assumption
<RobotPinkie> considering the size of the box, and the size of the bags
<Daz> that (there being 24 in a box, or space for 24 in a box if some have been taken), and if you look at the numbers on the packets and see they are in order, or at least no repeats, then yea buy a bawx
<Daz> OMAI so uh
<Daz> please answer
<Daz> how much is it for a set of 2 ponies where you are? and how much is a blindbag?
<Daz> (i need to know how much they'd be for Spain :P)
<RobotPinkie> a blindbag is about €2
<Daz> aaaand FS is a little dried and is looking pretty good.
<RobotPinkie> set of two ponies, I haven't seen.
<Daz> ...TWO?!? YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Daz> ah well. I haven't seen other ponies yet. Rainbow dash and rainbow flash tomorrow ^_^ ... unless there are blindbags, in which case i'll be split : /
<RobotPinkie> Single ponies are about €8
<Daz> did you hear about a 'round 2' of blindbag ponies, RobotPinkie ?
<RobotPinkie> yeah, I did
<Daz> were the bags silver or purple?
<RobotPinkie> ummm... both?
<Daz> http://mylittlewiki.org/wiki/G4_Pony_Figurines#Euro_Wave_II
<RobotPinkie> pretty sure it's first wave of blind bags, though
<Daz> ah ok
<Daz> wave 2 looks purplyer than wave 1
<RobotPinkie> got Sweetie Swirl and Sweetcream Scoops, so definitely wave 1
<Daz> well, my FS looks a lot better now, but still not as good as it could IMO : /. still, it was my first try ; )
<Daz> ah ok. and you have 5 now? which is the 5th?
<RobotPinkie> Rarity
<Daz> =D
<Daz> twi pinkie rarity =D
<RobotPinkie> Sweetie Swirl apparently "loves ice crearm," whatever that means...
<Daz> she loves ice cream then
<PrincessMolestia> 13Whoa, people started talking about.
<PrincessMolestia> 13*again
<PrincessMolestia> 13Whew, tired pony is tired.
<RobotPinkie> "creaRm", not "cream" :P
<Daz> sleep then :P
<RobotPinkie> ohay PrincessMolestia
<Daz> oh i see, RobotPinkie. lawl
<RobotPinkie> maybe she cuts people's arms off, freezes them and then eats them?
<Daz> Pinkie, regarde ta peur en face, et avec humour Ils ne peuvent pas te faire de mal, un rire et ils font demi-touuuuuur~~

<mib_0uosky> :D
<E_N> We really CAN'T do anything anyway
<madponyking> yo
<FreezeFrame> Specifically, Veti-lestia (Celestia acting like a more benevolent Vetinari, which is how I usually interpret her in the show).
<madponyking> whats goin on?
<NewDCD> 9>I loaded the scenario I just beat up again by accident
<NewDCD> 9>instead of saving
<NewDCD> 9ah well

<Dermathil> just passing by
<NewDCD> 9that's it for me. Gotta go buy a meal

<prince-dari> Oh, it might screw up if you start your sentence with a comma then a number.
<prince-dari> But meh, I can't be bothered to fix that.

<Daz> so i have the 2 promo packs from Europe?
<RobotPinkie> Yup, you do.
<Daz> I see
<Daz> ...I still wanna buy 'em all :D
<RobotPinkie> Me too :3

<Daz> i wonder if I can afford them all
<RobotPinkie> lol I definitely can't right now... but eventually
<Daz> yea...so what ones you have available to you?

<RobotPinkie> um... none that I can find, really
<Luna> bla

<Daz> you can buy the mane6 and which other ones? which ones are available where you are
<RobotPinkie> No idea which ones are officially out here

<Daz> but ones you can get. so you got mane6 and you can get cheerilee?
<RobotPinkie> ...yeah, it's gonna be 5 eps of filler, I think. I'm skipping it.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I've seen Cheerilee and Lily Blossom
<Daz> welp, i just saw a 23:09 episode in 2 minutes ; )
<RobotPinkie> but they were sold when I had the money :P
<Daz> mfw i actually thought the sasuke vs naruto was coming 2 seasons ago. i should read the manga haha
<Daz> alright, tomorrow's episode
<RobotPinkie> or well "had the money", I'm not going to use my savings account for ponies...
<Daz> ...it's another filler with bugs or something
<Daz> yea RobotPinkie same
<Daz> 'im just gonna use the money i have for random stuff, but use it mostly on ponii
<Daz> tomorrow i'm getting RD and RF : D
<RobotPinkie> when I have extra cash, I guess
<E_N> 7Yes
<RobotPinkie> Nice!
<Daz> yay~ you'll remember I went to get it about a week ago, but didn't :P
<Daz> also gonna be on the look out for blindbags, if I see them i dunno what i'll get i'll be split between them
<Daz> i DID scout around other shops here like 'Juguetelandia' and a few others you won't even know xD. but yea, no other toy shop has them other than Toys R us, who have a shedload of G3 and G3.5
<RobotPinkie> Cool
<Pinkie_Pie> I feel pretty shameful walking down the girls isle in Walmart, but I puff my chest out and do it anyway
<Daz> ikr Pinkie_Pie
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol, not that Hasbro makes good toys anyway =(
<RobotPinkie> Seems every store is slowly starting to get G4 here now
<Daz> well i'm really happy with their current toys Pinkie_Pie
<Daz> hurray RobotPinkie !
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Nvm, I was gonna mess with you as Rainbow_Dash and Bubble_Berry, but I dont like having doubles
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<Pinkie_Pie> You are?
<RobotPinkie> still mostly G3.5, but every store I've been to this week has had at least SOME G4
<FreezeFrame> “But I made charts and diagrams and everything,” That new fanfic definitely has good characterization for Twilight
<Pinkie_Pie> Orly?
<Daz> well, sure, Pinkie_Pie, the toys are cheap, my Daisy Dreams' head and body colour are different a little bit, and the hair is really cheap stuff, but it's fun to style the hair, the eyes and ears, and general shape is very well done and cute
<prince-dari> Lol, my dad is funny.
<Daz> whathedo?
<Pinkie_Pie> I got one of the basic rainbow dash's, and im gonna keep it in the box
<Pinkie_Pie> I cringe every time I see it though
<prince-dari> He was teasing me.
<Pinkie_Pie> THE CUTIE MARK IS BACKWARDS
<Pinkie_Pie> D=
<Daz> oh gawd
<Ziltoid> HHHNNNNGGGGG
<prince-dari> >my little pony and porn, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Sexy ponies? MY LITTLE PORNY!
<prince-dari> >Do ho ho
<Daz> my Fluttershy has a cutie mark on only one flank, and i know another fluttershy has some sorta flowerthing on her leg
<prince-dari> >Rest of family laughs
<Pinkie_Pie> You dad actually said that to you Prince?
<Daz> prince-dari, implying you don't xD
<prince-dari> Yeah he did.
<Daz> still, that's pretty harsh
<prince-dari> Meh, we joke around a lot.
<prince-dari> I floored him for it anyway.
<Ziltoid> prince-dari IS A HARDCORE CLOPPER
<prince-dari> ^
<Pinkie_Pie> Have you made him watch it?
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<prince-dari> Nah, he said he would some time.
<RobotPinkie> HAHA, oh wow
<prince-dari> But I never bothered to get him to.
<Daz> my dad's just 'I like Bonsai, and people think it's stupid, so i odn't mind you liking Ponies.' He's very creeped out by me brushieing though, but doesnt' mind the show or figures
<prince-dari> I don't think it's really his kind of thing though.
<Daz> prince-dari: do eet! you've no idea what i'd give to be in that position!
<Daz> My dad knows NO ENGLISH, and dub isn't out
<AllisZero> Your dads are pretty bro
<Daz> how's yours then AllisZero ?
<mib_0uosky> what is brushing
<FreezeFrame> Daz: What language, again?
<AllisZero> My dad's dream was for me to become a soccer-loving responsibility-ridden drunken womanizer
<FreezeFrame> mib: Brushing your MLP toys
<RobotPinkie> Man, it feels good to be out of the closet as a brony. I know some people are laughing at me for liking it, but eh...
<prince-dari> But yeah, what my dad said is pretty standard for our conversations, I said he looked like a saggy old scrotom - as I said, we joke around a lot.
<Daz> FreezeFrame: I am Spanish, living in south Spain, Granada (, 'El Jau')
<FreezeFrame> AllisZero: You could still love footie
<FreezeFrame> Oooh, Granada is beautiful, I've heard.
<Daz> lawl your dad's awesome dari
<Daz> what aobut .... was it you dari who watches shows with your mother a lot?
<Ziltoid> brushy brushy
<RobotPinkie> He sounds pretty funny, dari
<Daz> FreezeFrame it kinda is ^_^
<Dermathil> dari, he's got a "saggy old hip"^
<prince-dari> Well I watched the Inbetweeners with my um.
<Dermathil> ?
<AllisZero> Problem is, though, I turned out to be an animeloving nerdo, so he's resentful fo that
<prince-dari> mum*
<prince-dari> Which was pretty lulz.
<Daz> ah it was you, i remembard ; )
<FreezeFrame> Sounds like the jokes I do with my dad.
<Daz> RobotPinkie, how are your parents?
<Dermathil> alrighty, cyall again. Should be back in 2 1/2 hours
<FreezeFrame> He's pretty funny when he's not making racist jokes....
<Daz> bai Dermathil
<AllisZero> Later Dermathil
<prince-dari> Lol footbal.
<Daz> There's no ponies jokes here, my dad and I mainly joke about fitness stuff
<prince-dari> football*
<prince-dari> I hate it. :P
<FreezeFrame> Which is really uncomfortable, since most of them are about blacks, and one of my best friends in high school was black.
<prince-dari> As a spectator sport anyway.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno entirely, Daz. My mom thinks it's kinda funny, but she likes that I'm starting to sew again.
<Daz> you're sewing? nice, i used to do that. that's awesome RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> In general people seem to think it's laugh out loud hilarious :P

<Charles> occular*

<Daz> from what I THINK it'll be like when i remove straw
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah, that's the big problem with my Pinkie Pie, too
<Daz> but the hair lookslike it's gonna be so awesum
<Daz> you tried 2nd go at PP's tail yet?
<RobotPinkie> Think I'll just do a rarity twirl, pretty much

<Daz> skype, he was laughing a LOT
<Daz> so i think we have a new brony in the making ^_^

<Daz> well, glad you're here Pinkie_Pie, where we like both \o/ woohoo~~

<Pinkie_Pie> Thanks Daz, Lol
<Daz> looks like my night is set. pokeman, AI TEE craud, then Haus
*Pinkie_Pie needs to start collection Pokemon again
<Pinkie_Pie> I wanted to get a card of each legendary
<AllisZero> I stopped watching and following Anime because of MLP, Pinkie_Pie
<Pinkie_Pie> And I spent 50 dollars on this http://homepage.mac.com/viper.fox/card/2009DPt-P/043.jpg
<Daz> I barely had any cards, and even the basic games i only had some
<Pinkie_Pie> Same here Allis
<Daz> ...so worth it Pinkie_Pie
<AllisZero> For some odd reason, 26 episodes of FiM completely killed most animu series for me right now.
<Daz> yea i know that feel Pinkie_Pie, AllisZero.
<Pinkie_Pie> I know, Ash's Pikachu LV. X.. I had to have it
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<E_N> pffft animu, manga is much better
<Daz> :P
<Cat> Oh my, I've seen that anime
<AllisZero> Same thing, E_N
<Daz> gurren lagann 'killed' most animes for me. i always watch first 3 eps to see if i like a show, but it's been AGES since i watched a full anime cuz it just isn't as good : /
<AllisZero> Well, the feeling for me, that is
<E_N> I only ever read manga now
<Cat> it's the one where each character is a country of europe from around the time of the first world war, right?
<Cat> or something like that
<Daz> and now we're on this topic, a few videogames killed most, because of how good those few i played were :D
<Cat> it was pretty random, with short episodes
<Daz> yay, good gaemz
<E_N> Fallout killed most games for me
<Daz> haven't played it yet, but want to

<prince-dari> XD
<NewDCD> 9Goooooooooooooooooo my voice just brooooooooooke
<Daz> http://pokemon.neoseeker.com/w/i/pokemon/1/1a/Brock_fight.png
<MeteorVenture> i learned stoic because of final fantasy 10 i think
<NewDCD> 9Ash: The Perpetual 10 Year Old
<prince-dari> MFW in the latest pokemon show he's 8.
<Pinkie_Pie> @pony The pony that is a Pokemon Master
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that is a Pokemon Master is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
<prince-dari> He's getting younger.
<Pinkie_Pie> FUUUUUUU
<E_N> mfw you knew that Dari
<Daz> soon he'll be a baby
<MeteorVenture> 8 is way too young for him
<Daz> @sexymeter silvermane
<Steven_Magnet> 6silvermane is 333446% sexy.
<Daz> @sexymeter silvermare
<Steven_Magnet> 6silvermare is 1636464357375% sexy.

<Applejack> PIKACHUUU
<NewDCD> 9and then Pikachu exploded on both sides, spraying gory bits all over the Gym
<prince-dari> Lol DCD
<NewDCD> 9well, that would happen if this were Adventures
<Daz> never seen this, but is that guy brock?
<Pinkie_Pie> So, in other words.. Pikachu exploded twice?
<NewDCD> 9because Adventures is HARDCORE
<NewDCD> 9it's his DARTH VADER
<prince-dari> Wut
<E_N> Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuur Dari
<prince-dari> You've never seen pokemon before Daz?
<prince-dari> Are you serious?
<Applejack> d'aaaw

<Ziltoid> WUTR?
<E_N> Not really
<Daz> lawl, no dari i've not been livin' in a cave xD. i mean this episode specifically
<NewDCD> 9"JUST LIKE YOUR DAD, ASH!"
<Daz> >his good for nothing father. is it him?
<Daz> if so ;____; tears
<prince-dari> Prof. Oak is Ash's dad.
<Ziltoid> WHAT ISI??
<E_N> Then Garys is related to Ash?
<Ziltoid> OH MY
<NewDCD> 9nO

<NewDCD> 9his dad is Gary MotherFucking Oak
<Daz> i mean, dari, is that bearded guy brocks 'good for nothing dad' ?
<NewDCD> 9he fucked with the Timestream and got her pregnant in the past
<prince-dari> Mebbe.
<Pinkie_Pie> Such a pleasure to have you here Applejack.
<NewDCD> 9and that's how he earned the title Gary MOTHERFUCKING Oak
<prince-dari> Prof. Oak is always around Ash's mum's house.
<Daz> if so, i feel for him, he called himself 'good for nothing' : /
<NewDCD> 9because he fucked the woman known as Ash's Mom
<prince-dari> Whenever he calls.
<Pinkie_Pie> Perhaps you could accept your invitation into my humble Bunker?
<Applejack> gee, thanks
<NewDCD> 9it's in her birth certificate!

<Daz> o lawl
<Daz> RobotPinkie: ikr i can't decide for my sound. what goes well with pinkie bouncing?
<RobotPinkie> Rarity, that is :P
