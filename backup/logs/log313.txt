<Saturn> Luna: i'm voiced because i'm working on the doomsday machine
<Rawketman> Loona.
<Ictiv> oh
*Ictiv faceplants.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It means he's Ambasador of whatever country he's in.
<GrimGallop> @Luna: That would be called a "plus sign," an "addition symbol," or a "cross."
<Ictiv> SuperBrony64: Since I'm the only hungarian here...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Tis an honor to be graced with his presence.

<Luna> 07,01those little furry things?
<prince-dari> Haggis is fine.
<Ninjapony> Hi Das-Pon-Y
*Luna likes the highlands
<Saturn> so it can stand on mountains without falling over
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Suddenly dari
<Saturn> you get lefty haggises and righty haggises
<Simon2> dat prince-dari
<ScootaChicken> dat dari
<Das-Pon-Y> Shake dat... umm.. head?
<Saturn> the way to catch a haggis is to chase it the wrong way round a mountain
<Saturn> it just falls over
<derpy_pony> so if you attack from the front, they can't run away
*Ninjapony wants a pet haggis
<Das-Pon-Y> Low poly discord is freindly for crap PCs
<derpy_pony> too late
<Saturn> you can also diggy diggy hole and put an open bottle of whiskey in it
<Pony_Luna> haggis ?
<Saturn> haggises *love* whiskey
<derpy_pony> this attracts wild scots
<Das-Pon-Y> A wild scot appeared!

<Das-Pon-Y> derp
<Das-Pon-Y> yup
<GrimGallop> Hm. This makes much more sense now.

<Das-Pon-Y> umm... okay
<Das-Pon-Y> huh
<Tommy_Wisseau> where do you keep hearing those things ?
<Saturn> in the song that was just playing on the stream

<String_Shredder> i was at vinyl's club on new years and they dropped a bass at midnight
<Das-Pon-Y> :S
<Ictiv> CMC, home made, self planned, self built music act: Less safe than Spider-Man Turn of the Dark, more imprissive than 40% of today's music industry
<Das-Pon-Y> lol
<Ictiv> (Murdered chat?)
<String_Shredder> i was backstage doing the music for the CMC performance and the set nearly killed me
<Das-Pon-Y> sooo... when one of them gets their cutie mark, they're kicked from the CMC?
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm taking bets on who gets thier cutie mark first
<Das-Pon-Y> Apple bloom
<Das-Pon-Y> yay
<Simon2> UK?
<Ictiv> Das-Pon-Y: I think they eitheract slefish (like children) then lear a lesson about it, or just you know, they all get their cutie marks magically at same time
<Das-Pon-Y> oh noes
<Das-Pon-Y> LOL
<Ictiv> I think Scootaloo gets hers first. She is most likely to feel awesome about herself and forget about her friends
<Saturn> dat festival speech engine
<Das-Pon-Y> this is stupid
<Saturn> i know the people who wrote festival
<Ninjapony> Exquisite
<HeavyMetalDash> I got one for applebloom, one for scootaloo and one for at the same time the odds are looking goo for at the same time any takers?
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Saturn> they're from edinburgh
<Ictiv> SuperBrony64: Only PMV's allowed or simple Pony music aswell?
<Ictiv> becasue i'd like to request "A Waltz for Trixie"

<HeavyMetalDash> oh I dunno it's a mater of perspective
<Asmalya> Mornings!
<Ninjapony> Hi Asmalya
<Ictiv> And I'm still unhappy about Derpy scene *prepares for Apple Pies thrown at him*
<Das-Pon-Y> :(
<HeavyMetalDash> I thought her scene was fun
<Ninjapony> I thought it was a fun little wink towards us, it didn't need to be that awefully great
<Ictiv> Ninjapony: I have no problem with a wink
<Ictiv> I just feel they went too far a bit
<Das-Pon-Y> I loved the scene. One improvement could've been slightly higher pitched Derpy voice
<Ictiv> I don't want them to do what we want. They did just fine on their own instinct
<Planet6> aye
<Planet6> whoops
<Saturn> i mean aye

<DeadpoolDash> cramer is the Batman
<Ictiv> Saturn: I'ts obvious actually. That Planet #6 = Saturn but on the internet you could make such connections between most people
<Ictiv> Suddenly I started wondering... What if Tommy_Wisseau is the real Tommy_Wisseau?
<Saturn> Ictiv: actually, it's far more likely that the asteroid belt was never a planet
<Das-Pon-Y> umm?
<Das-Pon-Y> wut?
<Simon> dat rhythm
<Ictiv> Saturn: I know
<Rainbow_Rash> wtf is this
<Das-Pon-Y> dat accuracy
<Ictiv> Saturn: But it's interesting to think about
<Saturn> i think it was Herschel that originally thought that there was once a planet there, but it was subsequently disproved
<Ictiv> What sort of force could rip a planet apart like that?
<String_Shredder> being an earth pony is such a b:Och
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Mixing Rhythm Heaven and Ponies is the greatest idea ever

<Das-Pon-Y> Dat amazing accuracy
<ScootaChicken> to d'aawww some ponies
<Randomnerd> sleep well
<Ictiv> Saturn: I was thinking more along the lines of the martians testing Hyperdrive and crashing into it at near light speed :D (Very likely, I know)
<Dashie_Dashie> before I go.
<Saturn> Ictiv: i... love that theory
<Dashie_Dashie> SB, I'll draw a request for you :o if ya want.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Really?? :D
<Saturn> whenever someone asks me about the asteroid belt from now on, that's what i'm going to tlel them
<Das-Pon-Y> umm... lol?
<Dashie_Dashie> Least I could do for being an awesome host. :)
<Randomnerd> Dat snout
<Saturn> Ictiv: coincidentally, i was doing some astrophotography last night
<GrimGallop`> My internet derped. What did I miss? D:
<Ictiv> Saturn: Same theory is why Death Star is a stupid thing to spend money into. Why not use a tie fighter with lHyperdrive?
<Saturn> or at least, i tried to
<Das-Pon-Y> Twilight goes to DJ school plz?
<Saturn> we set up at a dark site, but it was a crap dark site
<Ictiv> Saturn: Really? Of what?
<Saturn> by the time we found another one, the clouds had come in
<Saturn> Ictiv: i was trying to snap the orion nebula
<Saturn> and get some nice pics of open clusters
<Das-Pon-Y> :D
<Simon> this... no
<Dashie_Dashie> I'll be back on later today SB, think about what you want me to draw. :]
<Saturn> specifically, trying to record star colours
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dashie_Dashie: I will, thanks a bunch ^_^
<Dashie_Dashie> yup. :3
<Das-Pon-Y> umm... this is not what i had in mind :|
<Saturn> but we ended up taking no pictures
<Ictiv> From where I live and a good few mile radius it is difficult to make out stars, not to mention nebulas, no matter what equipment you use... Air pollution is anti magic
<Saturn> and just looked at the sky through binos
<Ictiv> Saturn: You study Astronomythen? Or just hobby?
<Saturn> Ictiv: i used to study astrophysics, but it's just a hobby now
<Ictiv> Pop quiz: Are there any Blue dwarves out there?

<Das-Pon-Y> umm wut?
<Saturn> oh damn, i used to know the why...
<String_Shredder> wtf r guys talkin about?
<Ictiv> Saturn: Acutally, theoretically they are possible. Only problem is that for one to be created, the universe would need to be way older
<Saturn> i think there's a theory that they can exist
<Saturn> but nothing's been observed
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Going to change things up a bit now
<String_Shredder>

<TOY_PON3> Im sorry was that immature? I didnt notice ;)
<Lasharus> I might hate spongebob, but I really didn't want to see its boob counterpart, such as it is.

<prince-dari> Bye
<IshBestPony> *hai

<prince-dari> Hey
<Nyria> Oh hello IshBestPony ~
<SuperBrony64_> Bai IshBestPony
<LordCelestia> 0,5SuperBrony64 were only getting a white screen -_-
<prince-dari> Can you run the game windowed SB?
<Nyria> I have an urge to download the soundtrack to MOH now~
<Arentius> Nah multiplayer MOH can't be windowed
<SuperBrony64_> I might have to edit the settings file of the game.
<Arentius> its idiotic
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hey, im curious about something...
<SuperBrony64_> There's no option to do so in game
<prince-dari> There's some program to force windowed on fullscreen games
<Arentius> there might be when actually playing though
<LordCelestia> 0,5With Shy leaving the team, who's going to take over the Regulars room?
<prince-dari> Can't remember what it was called
<LordCelestia> 0,5Not that it matters. Im just leavin' this here^
<Nyria> And there it goes~
<Lasharus> I think I don't much like mips.tv
<Arentius> how many Harddrives do you need man?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Can you swap embeds to LS if this doesn't work?
<prince-dari> Why? Stream service shouldn't make a difference?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, using Procaster might make a difference
<prince-dari> Ahh
<prince-dari> Can do
<LordCelestia> 0,5Uuuuuse the procastah
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Lemme first see if I can change settings though
<prince-dari> But eugh, procaster
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> you can stream in fullscreen using procaster btw
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But it's so nice and purdy :3
*Dermathil has procaster and finds it very nice and tidy
<Lulu> 07,01I guess one of the admins
<Dermathil> ...
<Dermathil> so the first post isn't the episode followup...
<Lasharus> I kinda like ProCaster. It does what it should, on balance.
<Dermathil> ack
<Lasharus> 'oh no'
<Lasharus> I think the episode followup was the "DERPY DERPY DERPY (etc)" post.
<Lasharus> I'm sure a more expansive one may follow.
<Lasharus> Eventually.
<Dermathil> oh it will
<TOY_PON3> Derp!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright, time for Google to find answers
<Nyria> Google away`!
<Nyria> ~!*
<prince-dari> But you can't get FULL HD NEW OCD DECAIDO quality with procaster.
<Rawketman> Derp derp de derpy derp.
<TOY_PON3> yay for Google Chrome
<LordCelestia> 0,5Now that I think about it, does anything need to be done at all? Its just ownership, the mods are still mods.
<Dermathil> Seth said that he'd put the chimicherrychanga in in the episode followup originally but decided to give it its own post
<String_Shredder> do a barrel roll
<prince-dari> SuperBrony64: If you want the program to force windoed, it's dxwnd
<LordCelestia> 0,5Yeah it doesnt matter.
<Dermathil> also, raritycatchme and pinkiedevil will probably be in the followup
<TOY_PON3> That Chimicherrychanga looked good
<Lulu> 07,01indeed
<DeadpoolDash> mmmm....chimicherrychanga

<TOY_PON3> I LIKE ALLcaPS
<Lasharus> Dermathil?
<Dermathil> yes Lasharus?
<Lasharus> Given that you don't seem inclined to smack yourself in the head for making that joke (again), I shall do it for you.
*Lasharus smacks Dermathil upside the head.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai Procaster...don't want to load, huh? That's okay, you take all the time you need to get better...
<Dermathil> hhahaah

<prince-dari> I don't have access in that room though, so someone needs to fix that
<Dermathil> :3
<Dermathil> and I'm gonna continue doing it for a while more Lasharus.
<Lasharus> "joy"
<Dermathil> because it technically isn't allcaps.
<Lasharus> And it literally isn't funny.
<Dermathil> You no smilypants...

<String_Shredder> brb refresh time 4 me
<Dermathil> most people haven't refreshed yet
<Lasharus> Yes. Exaggeration to make a point is a fairly well known concept.
<Lasharus> But if you prefer it without embellishments: It's not funny anymore.
<Dermathil> but a flawed concept since your point becomes invalid because of it
<Ictiv> hm
<Lasharus> Oh yes, let's be literalist.
<Ictiv> no matter hwo much I refresh, it's still showing mips.tv
<Dermathil> :P
<Lasharus> It's not funny anymore. The first time someone possibly cracked a smile, and it might even have not been you but someone else. By now we're just cringing.
<Ictiv> can I get direct LS link?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright, live now
<Lulu> 07,01oh my
<Dermathil> Lasharus, who said I was doing it for making everybody laugh, I'm just trolling the mods at this point

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Clear your cache

<SuperBrony64> 10,02After I shut down from going live, it continues playback of the auto-pilot content
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So basically, there's a stream even when I'm not live.
<CriticKitten> Er, I did, but now it's taking awhile to load or do anything. :|
*CriticKitten pokes FF.

<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i'm only slighty confused now
<The_Master_of_War> Hi Shy!
<CriticKitten> Eeyup, the intro is longer than the game.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So yup, 24 hours streaming in a row O___o
<Nyria> Hey Shy ~
*The_Master_of_War waves
<TOY_PON3> Octomania is best game
<CriticKitten> That's impressive.
<The_Master_of_War> Mods may be asleep though :(
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> wait, this is a game?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup
<TOY_PON3> unfortunately
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i thought it was a tv show
<CriticKitten> It's a game about tacos.
<Ninjapony> 24hr stream > celebrate with Octomania
<CriticKitten> :3
<The_Master_of_War> I think the old E.T. game for the ATARI was better than this
<The_Master_of_War> and that game sucked hard
<The_Master_of_War> I've played it
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> ET was the best game ever
<TOY_PON3> I dont know TMoW thats pretty shitty
<The_Master_of_War> Legend has it that there's a giant pit in the desert filled with unsold copies
<Ictiv> [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: dot dot dot son, dot dot do
<Ictiv> t
<TOY_PON3> Atleast Octomania has tacos ET dont got nothin
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i heard it was in mexico
<The_Master_of_War> We should watch Doctor Who: Dreamland
<The_Master_of_War> bad animation, good David Tennant
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I bought it $10 new when it first came out
<TOY_PON3> and 10 dollars worth spent SB
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> so....did anyone elses stream derp or am i alone?
<The_Master_of_War> I have derp
<TOY_PON3> I gots derp
<The_Master_of_War> That's an expensive doorstop!
<The_Master_of_War> $10
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<The_Master_of_War> Speaking of which... I could use one
<Ninjapony> What were you thinking when you bought it? "Hmm, this looks like a great game"
<The_Master_of_War> Not the worst game I've ever played though.
<The_Master_of_War> Worst was this one... It was like, the first video game tournament game
<The_Master_of_War> they gave away cool stuff
<The_Master_of_War> silver sword encrusted with jewels with a gold hilt
<OneTrickPony> http://i44.tinypic.com/2ecznlx.jpg what do you guys think?
<The_Master_of_War> cool stuff.
<The_Master_of_War> But the game was all like... WTF IS THIS???
<TOY_PON3> QWOP is best game ever
<CriticKitten> 10 bucks? I'd say that it was worth it, but then, there's indie games like Terraria that put this to shame, so I can't even say that
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright, almost setup to play Heroes
<The_Master_of_War> Sylar???
<Nyria> Wait HeroeS?~

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Either way, it takes a bit of extra effort to get it to work, and I don't feel like talking right now >_<

<Wrek> 05etc etc
<CriticKitten> Okay, then Wrek wins.
<SuperHeroes64> Alright, how does it look? Sound aright?
<SuperHeroes64> :>
<Yahooz> Wrek always wins
<CriticKitten> ^
<Wrek> 05sound works
<Wrek> 05but for osme reason your game scales weirdly
<CriticKitten> Looks good, sound is working
<Wrek> 05oh well
<SuperHeroes64> Wrek wins everything because he draws R63 so every argument is valid towards him.
<Yahooz> "I draw G5 Ponies. Your arguement is invalid"
<Wrek> 05ok sb
<Wrek> 05load game
<Wrek> 05multiplayer

<Wrek> 05cause heroes gian exp
<Wrek> 05and level up

<Wrek> 05so you want your heroes to survive
<Wrek> 05the human one
<Wrek> 05is better for you
<Wrek> 05since it will keep your human troops morale up to have a human hero
<Wrek> 05remember to upgrade your troops
<Wrek> 05buy a barrakcs to access knights
<Wrek> 05a yellow bar means that the buildign is maxed
<Wrek> 05green that you can afford it
<Wrek> 05red and a cross is that you miss the tech to build it
*DerpyHooves` giggles

<Ictiv> that feeling when I recognize a unit by its movement sound
<Wrek> 05next couple of rounds focus on getting your town into a capitol, look on the capitol buildign and see what buildings you need to build it.

<Randomnerd> So... Lego is making "Girl's" Toys now. The line is called Lego: Friends.

<Robomorons> and now they are dead
<SuperHeroes64> Omg, wut?
<Robomorons> oh hae a crash happened
<SuperHeroes64> CRASH
<Randomnerd> Maybe Lego should make a show that promotes their product, and market it to boys, so a bunch of women aged 13-30 will start buying legos?
<otakon> bugger!
<Shizuka> silly lego, they do not need to pander to girls, we are quite capable of improvising pirate ships und military bases with huge tubs of assorted pieces
<otakon> yes
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Darn
<otakon> thats what I used to do
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<Wrek> 05just rejoin the game sb
*Ictiv hugs SuperBrony64.

<Robomorons> i miss 3do
*TOY_PON3 hugs Yahooz
*Yahooz is hugged
<Ictiv> You did well for a first try, now you go back and show them what you're made of!

<SuperHeroes64> I'll play against you Vi!
<SuperHeroes64> But I still need to learn more about the mechanics of this game...
<SuperHeroes64> This is my second time playing it
<DWR_Writing> SuperBrony64 what game type is this? e.g. RTS?
<Robomorons> first time it crashed, rite?
<Yahooz> shell be back at 8 SB
<Shizuka> i think i played a heroes game once... may have been 3 cause this music seems so familiar
<SuperHeroes64> I think, yeah.
<SuperHeroes64> This is a pretty cool game.
*TOY_PON3 has never played Heroes
<TOY_PON3> :(
<DWR_Writing> The only RTS i ever play is Command and Conquer due to its epicness (except C&C4)
<DerpyHooves`> 06<3 C&C
<SuperHeroes64> I'm not familiar really with older computer games though :/
<DWR_Writing> DerpyHooves` Generals 2 + Frostbite 2 engine <3
<DerpyHooves`> 06SuperHeroes64 wir play when I come back <3
<SuperHeroes64> Alright! :D
<Shizuka> und then vivi challenged sb to a d-d-d-d-duel!
<Robomorons> doo doo pe doo pe doo pe doo doo
<SuperHeroes64> I'll lose, but it will be fun to play ^_^
<Robomorons> that's gonna be stuck in my head now
<CriticKitten> C&C 3 is one of my favorite games. ^^
<CriticKitten> Generals too.
<DWR_Writing> CriticKitten i loved the campaign of C&C 3 and Generals is my favourite.
<DWR_Writing> Hopefully, EA wont ruin Generals 2.
<SuperHeroes64> When Wrek gets back, tell him I went for food as well :P
*TOY_PON3 goes to play some TF2
<Wrek> 05yum
<Wrek> 05juicy bits of pork with goat cheese and pasta

<RaveBrony> Oh, Ive never played Heros :(
<Starflash> RaveBrony you should try it XD it's cool
<Ictiv> 'tis a shame. Great game
<SuperHeroes64> Alright, let's roll.
<Ictiv> Since Wrek is just in the process of addictifying Sups, maybe he will be available to play with later?
<Wrek> 05dont run into the angels unless you KNOW
<Wrek> 05you have enough to deal with them
<SuperHeroes64> Looks like I get another chance to not eff this up :P
<Wrek> 05build up bild up build up
<Wrek> 05Im always up for a game of heroes
*Ictiv challange considered.
<RaveBrony> How much is the game? Maybe I get it for another time :P
<Wrek> 05alwasy engage SB
<RaveBrony> *Ill
<Wrek> 05you want the experience
<Wrek> 05aswell as always picking experience when finding chests providing gold/exp
<Wrek> 05dunno how much it costs today
<Wrek> 05had my copy for ages
<Starflash> Anyways, why are you guys playing HoMM3? Isn't 5 or 6 better~
<Wrek> 05nope
<SuperHeroes64> $10 on GOG
<Wrek> 05# is the best one
<Wrek> 053*
<Wrek> 05gameplay wise
<Ictiv> Wel l ididn't play Heroes in atleast a year, probably a lot more since people who would play it slowly disappeared BUT should I get my copy back from my father and fianlly get my computer fixed, I migh take you up on that offer Wrek
<Starflash> Oh?
<Wrek> 05yes
<Starflash> Now I'm interested. I got pretty good at 5, never tried 3
<CriticKitten> I like 5 best myself, but 3 is definitely a solid title
<Wrek> 055 and 4 were so simplified
<Wrek> 05imo
<Wrek> 05though i kind like how 6 plays out
<Wrek> 05but i miss the recourse hadneling
<Wrek> 05its a very economic game
<Starflash> Well... If you learn a couple of spells and stuff at 5, the rest is way too easy at any difficulty
<Ictiv> I think Heroes 3 was the game that got me into fantasy as a whole
<CriticKitten> 6 did some stuff good and some stuff oddly.
<Wrek> 05i did liek the whole custom hero thing though
<CriticKitten> Yeah.
<CriticKitten> That was a good move.
<Ictiv> Was first game that managed to convince me to read its text-cutscenes
<Starflash> Hmm.. there are some expansion packs for HoMM3 right? are they any good?
<Wrek> 05always remember to restock your troops when you can sb :D
<Wrek> 05the expansion were neat
<Wrek> 05but
<SuperHeroes64> I foresee losing
<Ictiv> SuperBrony64: Do not give up
<Ictiv> Let them come.
<CriticKitten> Not if you're smart about it.
<Ictiv> let them be sure
<Wrek> 05the new race wasnt that interesting and hard to play
<Ictiv> but show them the white of your teeth
<Starflash> hmm ok
<Wrek> 05the new maps for multiplayer were awesome
<Ictiv> and make them fear your steel
<Ictiv> fight well!
<Wrek> 05but as for campaign it wasnt that much either
<otakon> well
<otakon> HITS is proving a bust
<Wrek> 05kill the weaker stacks first SB!
<otakon> the interface is busted
<Ictiv> (Does SB have any spells so far?)
<Wrek> 05i dunno
<Wrek> 05havent teached him about that yet
<otakon> I enter in the correct infor
<Ictiv> Okay
<Wrek> 05he's still graspign combat and economy
<otakon> they tell my the info is INCORRECT
<SuperHeroes64> Yay!
<otakon> argh
<CriticKitten> See?
<SuperHeroes64> That sulfur mine is MINE
<SuperHeroes64> darn...
<CriticKitten> If you're smart about troop movement and such, you can usually win even if outnumbered.
<Wrek> 05remember to focus getting a capitol SB
<Wrek> 05you need that extra gold income
<SuperHeroes64> Where are the requirements?
<Wrek> 05hold right mosue button on the city hall
<Wrek> 05while inside the buy buildings
<Wrek> 05SB
<Wrek> 05listen to me!
<Wrek> 05go inside the buy building menu
<Wrek> 05hover the city hall building to see the requirements
<SuperHeroes64> Sorry, there's a lag in the stream between what you're telling me and what you see
<SuperHeroes64> All I need is money
<Wrek> 05yes
<Wrek> 05so
<Wrek> 05save up
<Wrek> 05and next round get city hall
<Wrek> 05then see what is required to get the next level which is capitol
<RAWRity> CONSPIRACY!
<Starflash> o.o RAWRity wut
<Ictiv> RAWRity: Shhhh Serious war making is at hand
<RAWRity> CONSPIRACY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tzI1iysdkA
<Ninjapony> *Shifty eyes* It's not a conspiracy, move along.
<Wrek> 05is uggest getting more troops before going further north
<CriticKitten> Pro-tip: All that glitters is usually stuff you can steal.
<SuperHeroes64> How do I build a castle?
<Wrek> 05you upgrade the keep
<MirrorImage> All you have to do is take a ton of Granite, add it to the mix
<Wrek> 05the citadel
<CriticKitten> Ha
<Wrek> 05in this case
<Ninjapony> Good one MirrorImage :)
<Wrek> 05no need ofr more heroes SB
<Wrek> 05make sure you can support the ones you have first
<SuperHeroes64> Just looking around
<Wrek> 05but you are getting better
<SuperHeroes64> Ill need to wait until next round for the castle
<Wrek> 05slowly graspign the concept :D
<SuperHeroes64> IKR, all thanks to you ^_^
<Wrek> 05once you reach capitol you should have enough income to buy all weekly troops
<Wrek> 05and upgrade most buildings
<Wrek> 05yfw SB had a better startign location than I
<Robomorons> steal the llake
<Robomorons> its glittering
<Robomorons> go steal it
<SuperHeroes64> I did already :P
<Starflash> Where do you get this game these days anyways o.o
<SuperHeroes64> Hence the blue flag :P
<Robomorons> oh
<CriticKitten> See? Told you. If it glitters, it's usually stealable.
<CriticKitten> :D
<SuperHeroes64> You can get it at GOG.com
<Starflash> =legal? :')
<SuperHeroes64> Awesome site where you can download old games legally.
<SuperHeroes64> You have to buy them ofc
<Robomorons> I wish the centaur was glittering
<Ninjapony> I know I have Heroes 3 somewhere, but I must have misplaced it
<Wrek> 05hey sb
<Wrek> 05provide people with the link i gave you if they care to join
<Wrek> 05best bet if you want compabillity
<Starflash> well it'll take another 30 mins before i've got the game anyways... dunno if you'll still be playin then
<SuperHeroes64> Will do
<Wrek> 05next keep upgrade is castle sb
<SuperHeroes64> Next upgrade is Capitol :D
<Wrek> 05then you can focus on your troop producing structures
<Wrek> 05and stack up massive armies on your mane hero
<Wrek> 05and kick some creep arse
<SuperHeroes64> IKR
<otakon> argh
<otakon> my is my stream so laggy?
<SuperHeroes64> Ohai otakon :3
<otakon> it's a bloody old PC game
<otakon> hi SuperBrony64
<otakon> damn it
<SuperHeroes64> So, this map I'm on, am I limited to only the area that I see?
<Wrek> 05nope
<Wrek> 05there is an underworld area aswell
<Wrek> 05fidn the gate and you find me
<SuperHeroes64> Oh cool!
<Wrek> 05i pickeda small map for a reason
<SuperHeroes64> Seems like there's not much to do outside of waiting to upgrade stuff though...
<Wrek> 05some maps utilise the whole udnergroudn as anotehr map
<SuperHeroes64> For now I mean
<SuperHeroes64> That's cool!
<Wrek> 05some utilize the undergorund for tunnels of travel
<SuperHeroes64> 4000 Gold a day! :O
<Wrek> 05eeyup
<Ninjapony> Save up for that one, it's great
<SuperHeroes64> Sure I trade some of my stuff in for gold?
<SuperHeroes64> Hai LC
<LordCelestia> 0,5Dat timing...
<Wrek> 05nope SB
<Wrek> 05well
<Wrek> 05you can
<Wrek> 05but the inflation is rediculus
<Wrek> 05not worth it at all
<Ninjapony> You can sell resources on the marketplace if you're desperate for coin
<SuperHeroes64> Is there really anything I can do besides just wait?
<SuperHeroes64> Can I fight those storm elementals?
<Ninjapony> explore things
*Dken2021 quietly enters room
<Wrek> 05hmm
<CriticKitten> With that army? Probably don't want to...
<Wrek> 05id would build more army first
*Ninjapony waves at Dken2021
<Wrek> 05they can be nasty
<SuperHeroes64> I'm waiting for Capitol before I expand my exploration.
<SuperHeroes64> Alright.
<CriticKitten> Elementals are pretty tough units.
<Dken2021> hey Ninjapony
<SuperHeroes64> Next time I should try that program that Dari told me about to window this game
<SuperHeroes64> Then I can scale the game better on the stream
<prince-dari> :P
<LordCelestia> 0,5Dat prince-dari
<SuperHeroes64> Dat dari
<Dken2021> speak of the devil
<otakon> hi prince-dari
<otakon> indeed
<LordCelestia> 0,5Speak of the dari you mean
<otakon> lol
<SuperHeroes64> O u
<prince-dari> Same thing.
<otakon> yes
<LordCelestia> 0,5*bad joke is bad*
<prince-dari> > : )

<Wrek> 05archangels are their upgraded version
<Starflash> I can easily play Heroes 5 but I just keep dying at this 1. =-=
<Ictiv> Hm
<Ictiv> I feel the urge to start a movement
<Starflash> oh well. take 3.
<Ictiv> a movement where we write tavern songs to the Glory of SuperBrony64
<[SWAG]Haku> So...
<[SWAG]Haku> How bout dat derpy?

<Ictiv> As in previous episode or as general?
<[SWAG]Haku> previous ep
<Wrek> 05waht is SB doing?
<Ictiv> Didn't like cameo?
<[SWAG]Haku> i saw the chats reaction
<[SWAG]Haku> yes and no
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Grabbing a link for DCD so he can play.
*Ictiv pats Haku on back.
<Wrek> 054 player huh?
<Ictiv> Me too mate. Yes and No. Me too
<[SWAG]Haku> I loved how they did that, how they did what bronies always wanted
<Wrek> 05all vs me?
<Wrek> 05:D
<Wrek> 05wait
<[SWAG]Haku> but at what cost?
<Wrek> 05VI is probably beast at this game
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Wrek> 05Vi vs dcd and sb
<[SWAG]Haku> This once dream achievement destroyed so many others
<Wrek> 05ill cry in the corner for the whole gmae
<LordCelestia> 0,5o.o
<ScootaChicken> hai thar everypony :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Haha
<Wrek> 05hey SB
<Ninjapony> hi ScootaChicken :)
<[SWAG]Haku> Her name is Derpy Hooves, not Ditzy Doo. Therefore, Dinky Doo is not Derpy's mother
<Wrek> 05gona host a new game so Vi can join
<Dumori> Hey all
<[SWAG]Haku> daughter
<Ictiv> Actually
<CriticKitten> Wicked. A BS mod battle. :3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Okay, be sure to save this one though :3
<Dumori> What's a happening?
<Ictiv> that is not true
<Wrek> 05i did
<[SWAG]Haku> ???
<Ictiv> Rainbow called her Derpy, granted
<Ictiv> but not Derpy Hooves
<Ictiv> Derpy may still be a nickname
<String_Shredder> hey everypony
<Ictiv> so no break on that part... sill
<Ninjapony> Hmm. I'll have to go now, and will be back on Wednesday
<[SWAG]Haku> Look, by the fanbase, Dinky Doo is Ditzy Doo's daughter. If Derpy isnt Ditzy, then Dinky isnt Derpys daughter
<Ictiv> It's hard to imagine her as a mother figure. or atleast not the one we imagined
<Dken2021> hi string String_Shredder
<Cypresswolf> I like how every episode this season has shattered hundreds of fanfics - and we're only halfway through the season and the casualties continue to mounts ^_^
<Ninjapony> Cya everypony
<Dken2021> bye Ninjapony, see you wednesday
<String_Shredder> r u guys rly debating wether derpy hooves is her real name?
<[SWAG]Haku> no
<Ictiv> Haku: She can be Ditzy 'Derpy' Doo. Meaning Derpy is a nickname she picked up that stuck
<[SWAG]Haku> Whether or not she killed have the fanbase
<Ictiv> I'm not debating, I'm just lining up possiblities
<[SWAG]Haku> i geuss thats true
<[SWAG]Haku> but still
<[SWAG]Haku> it boggles the mind
<Ictiv> What boggles the mind for me is that she's more mentally challanged now that Jim Carrey in The Cable Guy
<[SWAG]Haku> it also killed off the whole 'derpy is mail-mare'
<MirrorImage> *walking into the conversation late* yeah, i think the toy department would have a hard time justifying printing "derpy" on a name card
<MirrorImage> [SWAG]Haku: not necessarily
<Dken2021> she could still be a mail mare
<Ictiv> Because we had another Mail stallion?
<P0n-3> ... Has anypony else been craving chimmi-cherry-changas?
<MirrorImage> Rainbow Dash is the weather mare for Ponyville
<Dumori> oh we are streaming an early Heros?
<Cypresswolf> Not sure what was more shocking, Rainbow calling her Derpy, Derpy with speaking lines or the livestream reaction to it all
<MirrorImage> we haven't seen her do that very much recently
<Dumori> cool
<[SWAG]Haku> Theres a team of whether ponies. RD isnt the only one
<Ictiv> Who said the post office can have two employees?
<Dumori> I wonder if I have this one on disc still
<Dumori> what one it si
<Dumori> is it?
<MirrorImage> Ictiv: for that matter, who says the Post Office delivered mail that day?
<P0n-3> I've been getting an urge to wrap cherry pie filling in tortillas, deepfry them and sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar.
<MirrorImage> it seemed like it was a local holiday
<[SWAG]Haku> Derpy was seen as a wheather pony.
<Dken2021> P0n-3 never had chimmy chongas, but sounds delicioud
<Tommy_Wisseau> so who are we seeing right now ?
<DerpyHooves`> 06I shall win!
<[SWAG]Haku> I actuallly made some chimicherrychangas
<[SWAG]Haku> they were good
<Ictiv> [SWAG]Haku: I suppose that's good
<Dumori> Go for it DerpyHooves`
<DashWithRainbows> Dang...wish i had some :P
<P0n-3> Oh buck, I should come to the next BroNYcon and set up a chimmi-cherry-changa stand.
<[SWAG]Haku> look online for a recipe
<MirrorImage> aren't they basically just crude Churros without the cinnamon sugar Haku?
<[SWAG]Haku> no
<Tommy_Wisseau> What factions are you all playing ?
<[SWAG]Haku> Chimi Changas are a type of burrito
<P0n-3> As long as they have the BroNYcon in a bigger place than the last one.
<[SWAG]Haku> So they have a flour totilla
<Wrek> 05SB
<[SWAG]Haku> So...
<[SWAG]Haku> The chat died again
<Dumori> oh Heros 3
<P0n-3> Pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat chimmi-cherry-changa!
<Dumori> I don't know if I have 3
<[SWAG]Haku> So what are you guys ding?
*CriticKitten wonders who to root for.
<Dumori> I found 1

<P0n-3> MY GOSH what's happening on that desktop background!
<P0n-3> I spy with my DJ eye a sultry pony.
<CriticKitten> P0n-3: The image looks better with Luna in it.
<Ictiv> [SWAG]Haku: I thought... What weather ponies don't do is help with delievery. I think she eitehr did the lightning by accident, or she works multiple jobs
<CriticKitten> :D
<Ictiv> Which actually would enfoce the single mom imag
<[SWAG]Haku> yeah i geuss so
<[SWAG]Haku> So...

<otakon> damn it!
<P0n-3> Or chimmi-cherry-changa?
<[SWAG]Haku> and then the chat came to life
<P0n-3> That's a good question, really. What do I call them.
<Tommy_Wisseau> what who doesnt like a neck romancer
<MirrorImage> that's needs to be EQD's next poll
<[SWAG]Haku> i call them chimi charrey changas
<Ictiv> Haku: Funny thing? Came to life when Otakon said "Necromancer"
<[SWAG]Haku> its fun to nsay
<CriticKitten> Hm....
<MirrorImage> "So which is it? - Chimicherry, Cherrichonga, or Chimicherrychonga?"
*CriticKitten debates.
<[SWAG]Haku> chimicherrychanga
<Ictiv> otakon is magic. It's canon
<P0n-3> Chimmi-cherry-changa might not fit on the wrapper.
<P0n-3> I kinda like cherry-changa.
<[SWAG]Haku> CCC's are good
<Ictiv> Fianlly I have an ally in the magical arts.
<P0n-3> Oooh! I could do that! Put CCC on the wrapper.
<Ictiv> Congratulations otakon! You can be my sidekick!
<CriticKitten> I can't decide who to root for. ;_;
<otakon> what?!
<otakon> how?
<P0n-3> I could make kid-size ones too and call them Cutiemark-Crusader-Chimmi-Cherry-Changas!
<[SWAG]Haku> awww i wanted to be Ictiv's sidekick
<Ictiv> [SWAG]Haku: Do not fret! I'm awesome enough for up to 3 sidekicks
<[SWAG]Haku> So then I geuss were a team then!
<Ictiv> beyond that, I need to officialy start a fan club
<[SWAG]Haku> I am Haku, the sexy one
<Ictiv> I shall call you "Faceman"
<[SWAG]Haku> Girls swoon at the sound of my voice
<Ictiv> (or was it The Face?)
<Ictiv> otakon can be the planing one who "Loves it when a plan comes together"
<P0n-3> Hee! I could also make an apple-pancake verson of kaiserschmarrn and call it Jappleack Stacks.
<Ictiv> I'll be the insane one
<Tommy_Wisseau> You are Haku , shapeshifting master of darkness
<[SWAG]Haku> So otakon is the smart one then
<otakon> about WHAT!?

<RaveBrony> I cant draw an earth pony, let alone a Pegasus!
<Ictiv> Pi is exactly PI
<[SWAG]Haku> He got it wrong
<prince-dari> Dude I typoed 5 for 4, get over it.

<Ictiv> It's not 3.[something]
<otakon> jesus
<[SWAG]Haku> there we go
<String_Shredder> :)
<CriticKitten> OH. Wrek's Inferno?
<Ictiv> not even waht String_Shredder wrote
<Ictiv> it's Pi
<otakon> nope
<Ictiv> just Pi
<[SWAG]Haku> I like pi
<otakon> Pi goes on FOREVER!
<Ictiv> Maybe "Magnum Pi"
<CriticKitten> Darn. Tough choice. I like Necropolis and Inferno....
<Ictiv> but definetly not a limited number
<[SWAG]Haku> Somepony make a ponified pi
<Ictiv> Haku: Too late Studio B did it
<otakon> [2:55:29 PM] George Hicks(otakon): Pinkie Pi FOREVER!
<CriticKitten> Don't die too quickly, SB, I want to see those two duke it out. :D
<DashWithRainbows> otakon failed and is racist :P
<SuperHeroes64> ;__;
<otakon> I am NOT racist!
<Ictiv> S-B! S-B! He's our man! He can't do it? No man can!
<CriticKitten> <3SB
<CriticKitten> Sorry bro, but they DID pick my favorite two factions
<String_Shredder> beatles refference warning: pi has 1 after 909
<Wrek> 05i am inferno all the way
<otakon> what is going on?
<Lasharus> Ahhhh, heroes III. I should really reinstall that one.
<[SWAG]Haku> well, ima go for now people. die
<otakon> die?
<otakon> why?
<CriticKitten> I adore using Inferno for damage in Heroes 5, and liked raising the dead for cheap armies as Necros. Humans were lame. :|
<String_Shredder> will do
*String_Shredder dies
<[SWAG]Haku> i meant bye
<otakon> no!
<[SWAG]Haku> i dont know why i sade die
*Lasharus sighs and casts resurrection on String_Shredder.
<DerpyHooves`> 06<3
*otakon uses True Resurrection on String_Shredder
<Wrek> 05you have to agree CriticKitten that humasn are a good race to start the game with
<DerpyHooves`> 06Necrooo~
<[SWAG]Haku> serious brain fart
<Lasharus> Be more careful with your words [SWAG]Haku. And speak to you later. :)
<CriticKitten> True, Wrek.
<otakon> DerpyHooves`: you know I meant Necromancers right?
<String_Shredder> im awake!
<[SWAG]Haku> k bye people
<CriticKitten> Good for getting practice and getting used to the game.
<Ictiv> Okay, before heading back to work I leave you with a bit of holy music to counter the whole lot of necromancy going on
<CriticKitten> But I still prefer the two y'all chose.
<SuperHeroes64> Some pony PMed me, if you want to reach me, use this username. I can't access the other one.
<Wrek> 05i hate playing flux though
<Wrek> 05elementals are so unreliable
<Lasharus> If you've got Armageddon though Wrek...
<CriticKitten> 's true
<Lasharus> Conflux is fantastic for the Armageddon Spell :P
<Lasharus> Phoenixes, Magic Elementals, Energy Elementals...
<Wrek> 05im talking unit wise
<DerpyHooves`> 06<3
<Wrek> 05aslo
<Lasharus> Hell, half the faction is immune.
<Lasharus> Fair enough.
<Wrek> 05i call shotgun for the holy grail xD
<Lasharus> Ghehehe.
<Ictiv> When I find myself in times of darkness, Pinkie Pie she comes to me! Gigglin' at the ghostlies! Can't you see?... And in my hour of troubles, Rainbow stands right besides of me. There will be a rainbow. Can't you see? Can't you see? Can't you see? Can't you see? Can't you see? Friendship's truly Magic! Can't you see.
<Ictiv> That wa todays cermon
<DerpyHooves`> 06Wrek: not if I get to it first <3
<Wrek> 05<3
<DerpyHooves`> 06I would even say. . . no hunting for it until SB ist on his feet? c:
<CriticKitten> Necro with Holy Grail. Or demons with Holy Grail. Tough choice as to which would be more blasphemous.
<Ictiv> CriticKitten: Easy.
<String_Shredder> living is easy with eyes closed misunderstanding all you see
<Ictiv> Holy Grail with Cthulhu, who is also eating a non kosher meal
<SuperHeroes64> What is the holy grail in this game?
<Wrek> 05its a super item
<Ictiv> Unholy enough for you CriticKitten? :D
<CriticKitten> SB: Make sure you check in with your castle every turn, to keep upgrading and whatnot.
<ekips> aww yeah homm3!
<SuperHeroes64> Seems like ponies have heard of this game :3
<Lasharus> Hell yes SuperHeroes64 :P
<Wrek> 05its a classic game really
<SuperHeroes64> And yeah, I plan on doing that.
<CriticKitten> Once you got the money incoming at a steady rate you don't have to worry about it as much, but in the opening few rounds, you wanna get established.
<Lasharus> This game is brilliant.
<ekips> everybody should have heard of it
<DerpyHooves`> 06I love this game <3
<Lasharus> I love most instalments in the series.
<Lasharus> I think the only ones I dislike are I and VI.
<Wrek> 05i love the 3rd for its gameplay its really solid
<StarSwirlTheBearded> hi
<CriticKitten> It's arguably one of the best games ever made, to be honest. >_> So it's no surprise people know of it
<DerpyHooves`> 06I ddi not like VI. . . );
<Wrek> 05but im a fan of the 6th aswell
<Wrek> 05but 3 will always have a spot in my heart
<DerpyHooves`> 06IV ist a pain .-.
<Lasharus> I would be Wrek, if UbiSoft had released it in a working state.
<CriticKitten> I like 3 and 5.
<DerpyHooves`> 06III und V are mein <3
<String_Shredder> ringo is best starr
<Cyanide> Good afternoon Everypony!
<LunaTheBeloved> Hi
<String_Shredder> ohai
<Lasharus> Sorry, but heroes VI was a trainwreck, and it still has a huge amount of issues.
<ekips> i like 3 4 and 5, never played the other ones
<StarSwirlTheBearded> what game is this?
<CriticKitten> Ha, Vi barely ninja'd me. xD
<NewDCD> 09,01I had never heard of this game till a few days ago. Then again I grew on consoles and Fire Emblem, and recently migrated to mainly PC Gaming.
<Amazon> ^
<Cyanide> Wrek: Has the drinking started yet?
<Wrek> 05ive been a computer gamer all my life
<DerpyHooves`> 06you shall play soon DCD <3
<DerpyHooves`> 06Wrek <333
<Amazon> what game is this?
<Wrek> 05<3<3<3
<DerpyHooves`> 06TRS80 all the way~
<LunaTheBeloved> Ummmmmm.....
<DerpyHooves`> 06c;
<LunaTheBeloved> I have no idea
<Wrek> 05:D
<NewDCD> 09,01I would've been a Computer Gamer earlier, but back in those days computers were too expensive to afford over here
<Arentius> heroes of might and magic 3
<NewDCD> 09,01consoles were, ironically, more economical
<CriticKitten> Hm....
<StarSwirlTheBearded> ah
<Lasharus> Here's a nice example of why I dislike VI most though Wrek.
<Amazon> ah.
<Lasharus> On January 1st, the servers were down.
<otakon> eeyup
<LunaTheBeloved> ah
<Lasharus> Shit happens, people call UbiSoft.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> choo
<SuperHeroes64> It wasn't ironic, PCs are still more expensive than consoles.
<Lasharus> They couldn't fix it. Why? Well, their tech support had gone home.
<Lasharus> ......
*Cyanide wishes this computer could handle gaming
<LunaTheBeloved> Bless you
<SuperHeroes64> Assuming you want to game with them.
<Wrek> 05protip SB: get capitol ASAP
*CriticKitten flips coin.
<StarSwirlTheBearded> rather, bless us
<SuperHeroes64> Haha, that's my goal right now.
<Amazon> excuse me
<StarSwirlTheBearded> and this is why I don't like the inbrowser client
<SuperHeroes64> I've never seen these creatures before though so I don't know how tough they are...
<CriticKitten> Okay, since I suck at deciding things, I let the coin flip decide. Gonna root for the necropolis. :D
<StarSwirlTheBearded> I would have kept talking to Luna
<Wrek> 05troggs are easy
<Wrek> 05but get more men
<Wrek> 05your army is laughable
<CriticKitten> SB, stay alive long enough for me to watch a VioletPawnch of your army. :D
<StarSwirlTheBearded> because the client doesn't notify of her disconnecting
<DerpyHooves`> 06I can not see SBs army. . ?
<Lasharus> Watch the stream Violet :P
<Lasharus> Also, i'd nearly forget.
<DerpyHooves`> 06Ah~
*Lasharus tacklehugs DerpyHooves`
<The_Master_of_War> I need noms
<DerpyHooves`> 06I usually do not cheat. .
<DerpyHooves`> 06but when I do. .
<DerpyHooves`> 06es ist on stream
<Wrek> 05mainly helping SB though Vi ^_^
<Lasharus> :P
<Wrek> 05its his second game
<DerpyHooves`> 06dat slow animation speed. .
<DerpyHooves`> 06ohbby. ..
<Lasharus> I take it you always set it to max speed as well then Violet? :P
<otakon> we don't care vi!
<otakon> kick ass!
<Wrek> 05hey SB, increase combat speend in the options xD
<DerpyHooves`> 06if I use mein rush tactic I could violet paunch SB into oblivion. .
<DerpyHooves`> 06but I love SuperBrony64 <3
<DerpyHooves`> 06so I will not~
<Lasharus> And that alone is why I couldn't win against most players Violet. :P
<DerpyHooves`> 06Lasharus: Only way to paly
<DerpyHooves`> 06play*
<LordCelestia> 0,5Does anypony love me?
<Wrek> 05inb4 "nope, archangels"
<DerpyHooves`> 06makes it even funnier~
<Lasharus> I'm a turtle at heart. Slow development and conquest is my style.
<Lasharus> Which works perfectly against the computer.
<DerpyHooves`> 06yay I know where SB ist!
<StarSwirlTheBearded> or his
<Lasharus> Against Players? God no. :P

<Rawketman> A heart attack, obviously.

<NewDCD> 09,01definitely not
<arrowtothebroknee> too much HHHHHNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
<Ictiv> NewDCD: That's not a good sign

<Ictiv> NewDCD: Try to drink a glass of milk with a little honey in it
<NewDCD> 09,01I'm better now but I got this odd sensation on my chest
<NewDCD> 09,01not very intense
<SuperHeroes64> There's more symptoms to having a heart attack than an odd feeling on the chest
<NewDCD> 09,01but unpleasant
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah. Left arm is fine so
<SuperHeroes64> I'm trying to figure out what this chart means...

<RawketLawnchair> Something silly, I bet.
<Ictiv|Writing> A story
<Ictiv|Writing> Not too silly

<Ictiv|Writing> I don't write Grimdark... Well not GRIMdark.. Maybe sadish dark but none of it yet
<Lasharus> But as a storyline and single-player fanatic, I must admit I found myself disappointed by the campaign. Isabel is probably the dumbest thing ever to hit gaming.
<Wrek> 05my D&D stories tend to be dark
<Wrek> 05for instance the rp the other day
<Midnight_Tempest> dark is good, i like those stories... as long as they are written well
<Ictiv|Writing> D&D is a bit different than magical ponies :)
<RawketLawnchair> D&D with magical ponies?
<Wrek> 05it was with ponies silly
<RawketLawnchair> No, no.
<RAWRity> my D&D stories tend to be filled with many, many character deaths. I make meat grinders.

*kirzstryfe glomps DerpyHooves`
<PhrozenFire> She got what she wanted
<Dken2021> you went bra shopping with her?
<Phase4> this is new
<Ictiv|Writing> Dang it... I've just got around to opening a bottle of good Apple Cider and I need someone to whom health I can drink to
<PhrozenFire> Clothe shopping
<Ictiv|Writing> I suppose I will drink to Derpy's good health then
<Dken2021> oh
<PhrozenFire> Please Dken2021 I'm embarrased as is.
<IngloriousPony89> To Derpy and Rainbowdash Ictiv?
<Dken2021> ok, won't haggle you
<Ouroboros> She might be discreetly giving you the opportunity to figure out how the catches on bras work, sp you dont feel awkward fumbling with them, just in case you ever need to know, for whatever reason.
<PhrozenFire> :) I know.
<Midnight_Tempest> i should dl this game... it looks like fun
<PhrozenFire> and brb
<DerpyHooves`> 06<3 Ictiv|Writing~
<IngloriousPony89> It does look fun
*Ictiv|Writing raises glass
<DerpyHooves`> 06es ist!
<DerpyHooves`> 06Then ir all play
*TOY_PON3 sips on a juice box
<Shizuka> heroes 3?
<bluestrom_S> DerpyHooves` you gonna do the radio show later?
<Ictiv|Writing> To our firendly neighborhood jester and queen of hearts! A good helath and all that it implies to our liebling: Derpy Hooves!
*Nyria drinks a glass of milk~
<Lasharus> Oy Wrek, should you ever need someone to play this game with and the other mods can't be bothered, feel free to give me a shout. I've never played Heroes III online, should be a laugh. :)
<Nyria> Cheers~!
<Sumica> 00,10wait this is what the game was?
<Phase4> now this looks interesting
*Nittany_Discord hugs DerpyHooves` and Shizuka
*Ictiv|Writing pats Nyria on the back.
*Shizuka hugs nittany und vivi~
<Ictiv|Writing> Now on to the tavern songs.
<Dken2021> ummm..... to the sun, otherwise, we would be in the dark all day
<Ictiv|Writing> We still didn't write one for SB's Glory
<Phase4> well it would wook more interesting but my stream keeps dying :(
<Nyria> To the SB's ORA~!
*Dken2021 raises a cup of water
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> wait, 2 SB's?
<Midnight_Tempest> ok, im dling the game now DerpyHooves` i just hope it will run on my computer
<Nyria> I mean
<IngloriousPony89> Mine keeps lagging Phase4
<Nyria> To SB'S ORA~!
<TOY_PON3> Phase4: Me too
<Ictiv|Writing> [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: Eeeyup
*Nyria drinks ORA~
<Midnight_Tempest> whoa... right... forgot im also dling all of doctor who
<Shizuka> i think i did play this game before...
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i'm not sure if i should be happy or scared
*TOY_PON3 keeps drinking from juice box
<Dken2021> is it just me or is mips just randomly buffers whenever it wants?
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> it does
<Sumica> 00,10I think the stream keeps buffering due to the shear amount of grafics it has to process from this game
<Lasharus> Not just you Dken2021.
<Lasharus> It's faintly annoying at times.
*Nyria has it for me~
<MirrorImage> Sumica: mips wouldn't have to do any of that - your computer just sends it an image of your monitor after your graphics card does the rendering
<TOY_PON3> I cannot truely enjoy the gameplay with that buffering
<MirrorImage> so any lag is your system not keeping up, not mips
<IngloriousPony89> I wish I understood what was gooing on a bit more
<IngloriousPony89> going*
<Nyria> To much loading in games... reminds me of Fallout NV~
<Sumica> 00,10OI SB how long have you left the stream up?
<IngloriousPony89> I hated Fallout NV
<TOY_PON3> Fallout 3 was waaay better
<Lasharus> I could try to explain the whole thing IngloriousPony89, but frankly, it'd probably better if you got the game and played the tutorial :P
<Lasharus> *probably be better
<Nyria> I actually liked NV, but those loading screens killed me~
<IngloriousPony89> I can imagine it would take a looong time :asharus
<TOY_PON3> Skyrim has too many loading screens...or should i say the loading screens are too long
<Nyria> To the brotherhood of steel bunker~! *3 loading screens later*
<Dken2021> at least the loading times aren't as plentiful like sonic 06
<IngloriousPony89> Wasn't as much as a waste of 60$ as LoTR: Conquest was though
<Sumica> 00,10SuperBrony64, SuperBrony64_ I am now pinging both of you
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O___o
<Lasharus> This is not a faszt game indeed.
<SuperBrony64_> o___O
<Lasharus> *fast.
<Nyria> I wasted my money on RAGE, I don't play gaems that don't have story~ and the main character was meh~
<Nyria> games*
<Lasharus> One moment IngloriousPony89, I'll see about getting you a link to gog.com's page for heroes III.
<Sumica> 00,10When is the last time you stoped brodcasting?
<Lasharus> I believe at most it costs $9,99
<TOY_PON3> I like the easter eggs in RAGE
*Nyria bought rage on the first day~ 60$
<IngloriousPony89> I'm thinking of getting Rage. Stil on the fence though :P
<DerpyHooves`> 06get the copy wir have
<TOY_PON3> thats a ripoff
<Sumica> 00,10Mips keeps droping ofline and buffers you might want to find out why
<IngloriousPony89> Oh, and cool Lasharus
<Lasharus> No worries. :P
<Phase4> mips seems to have fixed itse... nope nvm
*TOY_PON3 has RAGE on his iPad >.>
<Nittany_Discord> I have RAGE.
<Nyria> Well, I picked RAGE up and put it down... never picked it back up again after that~
<Nittany_Discord> Bought it during the Christmas sale.
<Nyria> and then*
<Midnight_Tempest> HoMM3 complete right DerpyHooves`?
<TOY_PON3> Did you sell it Nyria?
<Lasharus> Sounds a bit like me and HoMM6 Nyria. :p
<Nyria> I'm thinking to~
<TOY_PON3> Yeah you should.
<Nyria> I haven't got passed the first disc~
<LordCelestia|Shower> 0,5GUS

*TOY_PON3 le gasp

<Nyria> Prasie LC~!

<Phase4> wait, releasday of the console?

<[wub]ehren> guys, its official!
<Phase4> mabey they'l finaly alow more than 4 players per game
<[wub]ehren> peanut butter!
<MirrorImage> Dken2021: smash dojo was as much advertising as it was a "guide"
<IngloriousPony89> I <3 Peanut Butter
<[wub]ehren> pftt
<Phase4> peanut butter is now offical
<[wub]ehren> I wub peanut butter

<Dken2021> I know, it was fun staying up and looking at what was coming up
*Nyria is going to get a drink~
<Phase4> streamception

<Shizuka> you should see the other pony
<Shizuka> :3
<CriticKitten> Okee. Was just getting a bit worried since it seemed it was running long.
<Wrek> 05i hope its a bit easier to follow now when it isnt SB's small window
<Phase4> http://life.on.the.moon.is.great.i.know.all.about.it/ :O
<Sumica> 00,10indeed it is werk
<CriticKitten> Yeah, can see things much more clearly.
<Phase4> Lulu: your hostname actualy resolves
<IngloriousPony89> I can see cleeeeaarly now the rain has gone...
<Sumica> 00,10and then everything went black
<Phase4> someone OWNS that domain name
<Wrek> 05and a bit faster game aswell
<Wrek> 05:3
<MirrorImage> Phase4: they would only need to own the "about.it" part of it - that's the only part that resolves
<Sumica> 00,10Geeee I wonder who could own that host, any ideas lulu?
<MirrorImage> the rest of it is server-side
<Nyria> Inb4 ception refernces
<Shizuka> inb4 there aren't any

*TOY_PON3 gets sleepy
<IngloriousPony89> Sleepy? You just bored or is it late where you live?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Good afternoon everyone!

<Phase4> prince-dari: how are you getting those post notifications, nothing obvious on the site and you dont seem to be polling it
<Nyria> <3 that little guy~
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, we agreed on 4 PM though
<prince-dari> Phase4: I wrote a script to check the RSS feed for EQD
*TOY_PON3 yawns and starts to close his eyes
<Lulu> 07,01nope
<SuperBrony64> 10,02And then delayed it by an hour
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Great, I'm lagging a storm here. Brb
<Lulu> 07,01he never responded
<prince-dari> It posts in the chat when the RSS feed updates
<Lulu> 07,01after the time change
<TOY_PON3> God dammit I need to stay up
<IngloriousPony89> What time is it where you live TOY_PON3?
<prince-dari> SB means that if he didn't hear about the time, he should have been here an hour earlier
<prince-dari> Since what we did was move it an hour later.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah, but he would have showed up an hour ago
<TOY_PON3> 2:04 pm >.> I woke up really early..
<LordCelestia> 0,5I shall name him scribbles
<Lulu> 07,01Anyway I guess we have to start then?
<Lulu> 07,01We can save the log for him so he can read up
<Phase4> prince-dari: huh, went looking for an rss feed while back, couldnt find one
<MirrorImage> LordCelestia: no... not THE SCRIBBLES!
<IngloriousPony89> I shall name him Squished. Because that's what Imma do to him.
<CriticKitten> So now you both have two castles, hm
<Shizuka> logging as always~
<Dken2021> I'll call him bitey, cause he's a big one
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Indeed, but he was the one who really wanted the meeting...
<Lulu> 07,01Yes that's also true
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I don't know why he isn't here.
<EspyLacopa|2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4tIi2Q_LWc <-- Behold.
<Phase4> "Weta is the name given to about 70 insect species endemic to New Zealand." Mutterguy lives in new zeland

<IngloriousPony89> dat video
<Lulu> 07,01True.. but I know prince-dari cannot stay for too long.. Due to timezones

<MirrorImage> An infinite number of men walk into a bar. The first man says "I'll have a drink." The second says "I'll have half a drink." The third says "I'll have a quarter of a drink." The Barkeep looks at them and says "You're all stupid" and pours 2 drinks.

<Phase4> Yahooz: after you kicked me it de-moded me
<Yahooz> dah

<Dumori> yep
<SlurryMoon> 0,3Yeah, there are 19 mods not including techies

<Dken2021> unfortunately, I wasn't able to stay awake in both shows, so I slept through most of BMN

<TOY_PON3> i suck at drawing
<IngloriousPony89> The song is one of Wooden Toasters
<RaveBrony> Guess i just have to actually understand the way theyre drawn instead of trying to rush it xD
<IngloriousPony89> I'm pretty sure, the title has Carrot Top in it
<Dashie_Dashie> sounds like a Pony remix ft. lonely island and Daft punk
<Ingwaz> beyond her garden?
<IngloriousPony89> Just search for Wooden Toaster on Youtube and you'll find it
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony just practice that's all

<Midnight_Tempest> shame you only got the one game on steam TOY_PON3... if only you had more than TF2
<otakon> emangamer: he did it earlier to SuperBrony64|AFK while he was playing
<Randomnerd> Little Mod's Room?
<otakon> I just don't want no allcaps
<Wrek> 05this level is bullshit
<TOY_PON3> >.> Im broke and plus I want more games WHEN I have the money

<Shizuka> 13you said that about all the Plutonia levels wrek :P
<otakon> TOY_PON3: I feel ya
<Shizuka> 13especially that one where you saved with 1hp and then exited the level
<RAWRity> Yahooz: very good. Just got to the part where one of the characters is killed by a spambot.
<TOY_PON3> hey otakon got a steam account?
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> it's otakon17
<pinkydash> Dat spambot
<Midnight_Tempest> well, when you get L4D2 then we can play TOY_PON3... im not a big player of TF2 much
<Yahooz> machine gun death!
<Yahooz> XD
<emangamer> ugh RAWRity PLEASE dont use "Mod3rator" as the title...using numbers as letters is THE DUMBEST thing you can do
<Yahooz> lolno
<RAWRity> emangamer: that's the joke.
<otakon> but I don't have TF2
<emangamer> RAWRity: but it's not a joke. its just dumb
<TOY_PON3> I was planning on that Midnight_Tempest and okay otakon
<Yahooz> emangamer RAWRity loved my title idea... Moder4tor: The Assimilation
<otakon> plus
<otakon> my bandwidth is garbage
<Dken2021> Scr4m
<RAWRity> Dken2021: Scre4m
<Yahooz> inb4 MW4
<otakon> 2mbps tops
<otakon> F3AR
<otakon> you all forgot about that one
<emangamer> Mod-three-arator...I dont get it...whats so cool about it
<Midnight_Tempest> we believe in you Wrek, believe in us who believe in you!
<RAWRity> Modern W4rf4re
<Yahooz> Left4Dead...oh wai
<Yahooz> *wait
<emangamer> otakon: f-three-er
<Yahooz> R4WRity
<fluttercry> 05,15MW3...because you will buy a game you already own if it has a new number on it
<otakon> ar
<TOY_PON3> Wrek gots this! :)
<otakon> fluttercry: it's becoming the new Madden
<otakon> or another Madden
<Nittany_Discord_> You sure will when 30 million others do.
<Yahooz> V10l3nt SH1T 2
<RAWRity> fluttercry: to be fair, that's how most sequels are.
<pinkydash> Yahooz: Pinki3Krew requests THE POWER OF GOD BESTOWED TO THEM
<Yahooz> alrighty
<Nittany_Discord_> And you spend a buttload of money on extras.
<Nittany_Discord_> In two years, CoD will be a MMO.
<otakon> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15this is true. but especially in the case of the CoD series. There is such a little difference between them.
<emangamer> ^
<emangamer> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<emangamer> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6
<emangamer> dat 6
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< curse IT!
<otakon> I wonder if they'll still use Madden when he kicks the bucket?
<RAWRity> essentially, after the first Modern Warfare, they've just been the same game over and over.
<Dken2021> inb4 a cod fan tells you there's a difference
<Yahooz> essentially, minus the campaign
<Nittany_Discord_> Well, blame people that buy it and blame Activision for their business practices.
<RAWRity> otakon: then they'll make a "Memorial" edition that has a mod where you can make all your players into Madden.
<emangamer> someone HONESTALLY tried to tell me there was a difference between BF3 and MW3
<Midnight_Tempest> the name
<otakon> lol RAWRity
<Cyanide> there isnt though
<emangamer> GOD DAMMIT Midnight_Tempest I JUST LOST THE GAME
<TOY_PON3> yeah i gave up on both titles already
<Midnight_Tempest> XD
<fluttercry> 05,15Well there is between those. BF3 is slower and not as explosive
*emangamer lost the game...FUCK
<Dken2021> someone should make a mod of that now
*TOY_PON3 pats emangamer's back
<Nittany_Discord_> I have BF3, but will probably sell it. I never had fun with BF3.
<RAWRity> emangamer: now, to be fair, the Multiplayer in BF3 is more complex than MW3's "Everybody is John Rambo" approach to battles.
<TOY_PON3> I have MW3
<Nittany_Discord_> But I haven't played a fun MP shooter in a long time.
<TOY_PON3> :P
<emangamer> RAWRity: but it's the same game
<Dken2021> dat Fleur
<RAWRity> BF3 usually requires some strategy or team work.
*Dermathil tries to squint his eyes to see the stream
<Dermathil> did I see... the BFG?
<Midnight_Tempest> i want a mod for L4D and L4D2 that makes the players into ponies... that would be awesome
<TOY_PON3> i hate when no one works as a team in multiplayer ._.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14BF3 ist staretgey
<RAWRity> emangamer: eh, as far as mechanics and campaign? yeah. But the balancing of enemies, skills required, and general atmosphere of BF3 is superior to MW3.
<emangamer> thats pretty funny DerpyHooves`
*Dken2021 wonders if Halo is still relevent
<Nittany_Discord_> I less like the publishers behind the games than the games themselves.
<Midnight_Tempest> i would play a MP game if i had headphones and playing with people from bronystate
<Fleur> ^
<emangamer> Dken2021: nah not really
<fluttercry> 05,15it does though. If you try to just rush in, you get destroyed
<Dken2021> but it looks interesting
<Nittany_Discord_> Well, I have L4D and L4D2
<RAWRity> Dken2021: it will be once Halo 4 comes out.
<TOY_PON3> ugh noobs...
<Dermathil> Just buy Section 8 Prejudice, me and Wrek play it once in a while
<CriticKitten> Mrow? We talking about Medal of Modern Battlefield again? o.O
<emangamer> RAWRity: not really...cuz it will suck
<fluttercry> 05,15Also jets are the most fun thing ever
<Nittany_Discord_> I would also like to play with other friends and not randoms.
<RAWRity> emangamer: but it will be relevant.
<Midnight_Tempest> dat cyberdemon
<emangamer> how did Wrek get 192% life?
<Dken2021> he's giving it 192%
<fluttercry> 05,15mega sphere?
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<emangamer> Ohai Ghosties...
<CriticKitten> eman: He ate some spanich.
<TOY_PON3> c'mon Wrek you can do this!
<RAWRity> and if anything, Halo is at least more colorful than the COD series.
<Nittany_Discord_> I don't want to get into BF3. Probably like the other titles: Unforgivingly-steep difficulty curve.
<Midnight_Tempest> oh in da face
<otakon> hwo did he die in one hit?
<Wrek> 05cause that CYBERDEMON one shots
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: only for the vehicles
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: kinda. BF3 requires some strategy, so your teammates play a big part in how well you're able to perform.
<Midnight_Tempest> cyberdemon dead now?
<Nittany_Discord_> I sucked in BC2.
<LadyCanary> Seems that way.
<fluttercry> 05,15but most of the time everyone but you will sit in the back and snipe
<Nittany_Discord_> But I was a loner.
<RAWRity> It's designed so that you can't just go out and kill people on your own.
<TOY_PON3> but not anymore right Nittany_Discord_?
<otakon> argh
<Nittany_Discord_> I stopped playing BC2.
<RAWRity> You have to actually communicate with your team mates. Which makes it easy to see when a COD player is trying out BF.
<otakon> ^
<Nittany_Discord_> I wasn't having fun.
<emangamer> wait...why is there Nittany_Discord and Nittany_Discord_?
<RAWRity> emangamer: connection issues
<Nittany_Discord_> Because I'm on mIRC.
<Midnight_Tempest> whats the point of an MP game that you dont work with your teammates to survive? L4D and L4D2 are best examples of teamwork
<otakon> eeyup
<Nittany_Discord_> I'm trying to get a color script running on either.
<TOY_PON3> well maybe it was for the best idk
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: for people who want to be John Rambo/a bullet bag.
<Yahooz> Alright im going to watch some football. If im not back in two hours than goodnight.
<Nittany_Discord_> I would play BF with friends more than randoms.
<otakon> I hated the fact that CoD MP was always free for all regardless of mode
<Dken2021> have fun Yahooz
<fluttercry> 05,15This is usually what my teams end up like http://ragecomics.memebase.com/2012/01/09/rage-comics-stand-together/?fb_ref=newpromocopy
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: thoes are the Halo players that rage quit when they move out of cover
<Nittany_Discord_> CoD MP has killstreaks. That makes it unbalanced and unfair to new players and unskilled players.
<Nyria> Good evening gentleman~
<emangamer> hey bronyriffic
<Nittany_Discord_> It pretty much shuts out anyone with little patience.
<Midnight_Tempest> Nyria<3
<Dken2021> evening Nyria
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: nah, COD players are generally like that too. Playing BF3's MP you can tell who the regular COD players are by who immediately runs towards the enemy and gets lit up like a christmas tree.
<Nyria> Oh~! Midnight_Tempest <3
<pony_4377> DOOM!
<LadyCanary> Hi Nyria! yfw I'm a lady xD
<Dken2021> ohai pony_4377

<emangamer> LadyCanary: I think everypony already knows your a lady from the LADY part of your name

<Nyria> When was this Lord_of_Beards
<TOY_PON3> tis a lie!
<Lord_of_Beards> yes, I am the Lord of ALL Beards and the Regent of Moustaches as well
<Silverscreen> If my schedule isn't too demanding, I may come back.
<TOY_PON3> Lord_of_Beards is a lord not a otakon
<Lord_of_Beards> but the latter is a lesser title
<Nyria> Lord_of_Beards: Well... are you racist?~
<Dermathil> Yay I'm happy to hear this SS!
<Nyria> :3
<Lord_of_Beards> no
<Dermathil> really very happy!
<TOY_PON3> thats good SS
<Dermathil> :D
<Lord_of_Beards> unless your siderburns
<Silverscreen> And I may ressurrect some old memes. :D

<Nyria> I'm not sure...
<Lord_of_Beards> Silverscreen: like what?
<fluttercry> 05,15Where was gondor when Silverscreen returned
<Dken2021> BMN memes?
<Dermathil> Silverscreen, have you got a flute to play?
<Fleur> gondor was sitting around with its head up its ass
<Dermathil> (really old meme dating back to a hooful of bits)
<RAWRity> otakon: y so beard obsessed?
<TOY_PON3> i like that idea Dken2021
*LadyCanary giggles
<Silverscreen> Flutes, barrels and Gondor, ohmai.
<Dermathil> Rawrity: his beard is the most regal of them all
<CriticKitten> This visitation of Silverscreen was brought to you by the Man With No Name. :|
<Fleur> cant forget leverage
<RAWRity> Fleur: since when is Gondor in Washington DC?
<Fleur> LOL
<Nyria> Man these meme's open up massive to usage...
<Fleur> ha ^
<RAWRity> Fleur: no all caps
<Silverscreen> RAWRITY: Where was Washington when the SOPA Bill threatened the internet?
<Dermathil> hahah rawrity
<Nyria> We can't forget ...
<RAWRity> Silverscreen: it was with SOPA, arguing over it.
*Midnight_Tempest simply walks into Gondor <_< >_>
<Nyria> ORAORAORAOROAROARO
<Silverscreen> XD
<Fleur> Silverscreen washington was sitting on its ass

<TOY_PON3> brb gonna cheer up my big bro he's hurting
<TOY_PON3> :(
<fluttercry> 05,15Well anyone can walk into Gondor.
<Nyria> Oh okay TOY_PON3~
<Midnight_Tempest> well damn
*Silverscreen hasn't seen any new episodes since Sisterhooves Social. x.x
<Fleur> Send him my wub
<RAWRity> do not take this out of context: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly5rh8A6dz1r19504o1_500.png
<Dken2021> then you're in for a doozy
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Silverscreen: do it nowwwwwww
<LadyCanary> Dat face.
<Dermathil> Silverscreen watch yesterday's episode asap.
<Dashie_Dashie> Hence why fluttershy is my favorite
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjWqTLWYERc&feature=related
<Nyria> Wait a second...
<Silverscreen> Yeah, I heard Derpy gets a bigger role and all that.
<LadyCanary> Yaaaay~
<Dermathil> The episode was more awesome than Lesson Zero and Luna Eclipsed
<Nyria> I'm forgeting a meme~
<Dken2021> something like that, yes
*Midnight_Tempest tries to walk into Mordor and is merciless slaughtered 'Nooooooo!!' x_x
<fluttercry> 05,15Let's face it, Nyria will never figure it out
<RAWRity> Dermathil: granted that's not hard for Luna Eclipsed...
<Nittany_Discord> Derpy has quite a role indeed.
<Dermathil> Well Luna was great in LE
<LadyCanary> I would love to see more Luna.
<Nyria> fluttercry: Yeah... We will never figure it out~
<Fleur> hey... where is that shoe king?
<Nyria> King of shoes, Aquire all the leverage~!
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14roll?
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14roll???
<Shizuka> 13roll?
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14buble warp
<Midnight_Tempest> rock
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14<3
<Silverscreen> I don't get why people claim Season 2 isn't as good as Season One. It hink they're all just suffering from Nostalgia Goggles. Season two, at worst, is on par with S1 in terms of good/bad/okay episodes, IMO
<CriticKitten> Picklebarrel~
*Shizuka 13thinks vivi must be terribly sleepy right niw~
<Midnight_Tempest> ALL the bubble wrap
<Dermathil> Silverscreen, I prefer S2 to S1 personally.

<Nittany_Discord> Season 2 has been awesome.
<Dermathil> ChimmiCherry Cherrichanga!
<Lord_of_Beards> Wrek: close some tabs man!
<Nittany_Discord> Mare-do-well has been the only meh episode.
*Nyria wubs all the ponies
<Midnight_Tempest> season 2 is awesomes!!
<Dken2021> same Nittany_Discord
<Silverscreen> I actually liked Mare-do-Well.
*Midnight_Tempest wubs Nyria back <3
<Lord_of_Beards> Picklebarrel, Picklebarrel, Kumquat, CHERRYCHANGA!
<Dermathil> seems like Wrek had a crash
<Nyria> <3
<Dken2021> wait, you're a h-op now?
<RAWRity> Silverscreen: didn't you say you hadn't seen anything past Sisterhooves?
<Silverscreen> It did kinda rehash the Trixie episode theme, but it was done differently and rather well.
<CriticKitten> SS: Oh my gosh, someone else who liked it?!?
<LordCelestia> 0,5And it flew real low
<Silverscreen> RAWRity: Yes.
<Lord_of_Beards> hi Lord_of_Beards

<Lord_of_Beards> Good evening to you, LordCelestia
<RAWRity> Silverscreen: Sisterhooves was e5. Mare-do-well is e8
<Silverscreen> LordCelestia?
<Silverscreen> Oh, so I did.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hi there!
<Midnight_Tempest> talking to yourself, first sign of mental problems... or just lonely
*Silverscreen blehs.
<Randomnerd> Uh oh.
*Lord_of_Beards is lonely
*Silverscreen talks to himself all the time.
<Silverscreen> *FOREVER ALONE*
<LordCelestia> 0,5Lord of beards must be otakon

<Dken2021> lali-ho IngloriousPony89

*IngloriousPony89 talks to himself as well
<Nyria> Lord_of_Beards: Wait... What's my name?~

<RAWRity> Silverscreen: ah, so you've got 4 eps to cath up on.
<IngloriousPony89> Get a'watchin
<Lord_of_Beards> Why do you ~ at the end of every sentece? Are you a dandy?
<Fleur> no
<Lord_of_Beards> That means no facial hair!
<Fleur> he is in wub
<Nyria> I think ponies can wait, this is the first I've seen of Silverscreen ~
<Nyria> Lord_of_Beards: yes~
<Lord_of_Beards> You are beneath me sir!
<Lord_of_Beards> Be gone with you!
<RAWRity> Hearth's Warming Eve, Family Appreciation Day, baby Cakes, and The Last Round Up.

<Sato> sato ftw.
<Dashie_Dashie> I have Molestia on speed dial..
<Lord_of_Beards> Your nakedness of the face appals me!
<Dashie_Dashie> don't make me.
<IngloriousPony89> Mind calling her up for me Dashie? :D
<RAWRity> Baby Cakes is indeed the cause of half the world's cases of diabetus.
<Dermathil> So how are you feeling today Silverscreen? I'm hyper happy to see you around once more!
<Lord_of_Beards> Silverscreen: Have you seen the newest as of yesterday?
<Dermathil> he hasn't otakon
<Silverscreen> Dashie_Dashie, knowing some of the people in FiM fandom, I think they might like that.
<CriticKitten> Silverscreen: Good one to have stopped on, though. It's a solid ep
<Silverscreen> Lord_of_Beards: No.
<Dashie_Dashie> .__.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh boy, yesterdays episode was amazing. If he hasnt seen it dont spopil it

<IngloriousPony89> Derpy? What derpy?
<Fleur> Dashie_Dashie I havent had a chance to speak to the princess in some time. I need to get in touch with her more often.
<Dken2021> imo, it was a little meh
<Silverscreen> I heard she actually talks too.

<Kyle113> Thanks haha
<Dermathil> Lord_of_beards, I assume your beard is immutable to razor blades since only your fingers can cut them?
<zeppony> 555-LUNASUX is celestia's office number

<Midnight_Tempest> what is +k?
<LadyCanary> Why would anyone TRY to get banned.
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Fleur> rev got his ass banned
*Lord_of_Beards beard grows back instantly, twice of thick and lustrous!
<Peachy> I think he wants to make sure he doesn't accidentally stumble in here or something
<Wrek> 05cant remember rev acting liek that before
<Peachy> ever
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: because they need attention.
<Nyria> Fleur: He did?~ I'm not suprised~
<zeppony> REV IS B&
<LadyCanary> Either that or they're reaaaallly stupid.
<emangamer> ^
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: that usually goes hand and hand
<Lord_of_Beards> I believe he is stupid
*LadyCanary nods
<Lord_of_Beards> not 1/10th of the intelligence of my facial folicles!
<tvoie> did not clicking links finally work?
<fluttercry> 05,15Well time to delete the history
<RAWRity> though really, in terms of nasty images, that's really not that scarring.
<Lord_of_Beards> Tis not.
<Silverscreen> Also, can't stop listening to Tombstone's remix of Ponybeat's Discord.
<Peachy> Now that's just mean! Rev is not stupid
<emangamer> RAWRity: it isnt the thing you want to click on in the presence of your parents though
<Peachy> I'm quite fond of Rev.
<RAWRity> I mean, if you're gonna troll, make is something really nasty that people will remember. That image barely elicites a reaction.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14I am fond of Rev
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14but reuls ar reuls
<RAWRity> emangamer: yes, but that's half the internet.
<emangamer> RAWRity: only half?
<RAWRity> emangamer: the other half is ponies
<Nyria> I'm kind of netural on rev myself, but the last 2 days... he scared me~
<Dashie_Dashie> I like turtles.
<emangamer> I've never seen Rev online before though
<LadyCanary> I havent seen too much of rev lately besides yesterday.
<RAWRity> Nyria: that's the most peppy fear I've ever seen.
<Peachy> and now you'll never see him again
<Shizuka> 13in happier news...
<Peachy> because some silly rule
<tvoie> how much did i miss... does the moon change people that much?
<Lord_of_Beards> my beard is GLORIOUS!

*Silverscreen puts on cool sunglasses.

<Lord_of_Beards> I will be the judge of his folicles
*Silverscreen is also a TVtroper. Likes to find tropes. is fun, no?
<tvoie> i came back for a few minutes... wait... he didn't?!?
*Midnight_Tempest dives into Lord_of_Beards beard and places Nair bombs *evil laughter*
*Lord_of_Beards examines Silverscreen beard carefully
<RAWRity> Silverscreen: you are correct.
<Lord_of_Beards> Midnight_Tempest: nonsense
<Dken2021> Silverscreen who doesn't?
*zeppony wonders if silverscreen has resigned himself to a vow of /me
<tvoie> did my clone come back from the moon and wreak havok on you guys?
*Lord_of_Beards pulls out the Nair bombs effortlessly using his BEARDED FU!
<emangamer> indeed he did tvoie
<zeppony> whois RAWRity
*Silverscreen is not resigned. Just likes the use of this function.
<RAWRity> zeppony: I am Me.

<emangamer> ok
<Midnight_Tempest> ah
<Lord_of_Beards> I have just have come in magnificently late is all.
<RAWRity> DerpyHooves`: pointless? likely. But it's still interesting to read through. Some of this stuff you don't notice until it's pointed out.
<Shizuka> 13+K is no repeat messages, +k is passworded channel
<Lord_of_Beards> Indeed RAWRity I agree

<Lord_of_Beards> What moonspeak? That language is a plain as my beard is magnificent!
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14RAWRity: mor liek thi stuf i notcied bfor reendg it

<Lord_of_Beards> emangamer: NO! you must be duller than the Razors of Obselenense!
<RAWRity> besides, it's helped me build my skills as a writer. A lot of stuff I didn't really think about or examine when it comes to writing and story construction beforehand now comes almost second nature to me.
<tvoie> for a number of years now work has been proceding in order to bring perfection to the crudely concived idea of a transmission that would not only provide inverse reactive current with unilateral phase detractors...
<tvoie> that's moonspeak
<Asmalya> DerpyHooves`: BAD PONY!

<Shizuka> 13and they are gone now
<emangamer> they deserve it
<prince-dari> Also holy shit MFW Silverscreen.
<Ingwaz> Leo: some people are bad, some people are good, get that everywhere, we just kick the bad ones out usually
<Silverscreen> Hi.
<RawketLawnchair> Scout likes moving fast. RD likes moving fast. they are prefect for each other.
<prince-dari> Good to see you bro, but I need to get back to bed.
<zeppony> why do all chanops and half-ops talk in colors?
<emangamer> prince-dari:http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lg2ejerMFy1qfn8beo1_250.gif
<Leo> i don't really see good or bad, just different
<emangamer> oh wait
<RAWRity> oh yeah, wasn't Lyra trying to get somebody to troll us in #brony last night?
<Dashie_Dashie> Dash + santa hat = d'aww
<Silverscreen> G'night, Dari.
<PhrozenFire> Would you guys hate me If I told you I was eating rainbow frosted cupcakes?
<Midnight_Tempest> ok... so how do i got onto bronystate though mIRC... i seem to have become computer illiterate suddenly
<Ingwaz> thats easy zeppony, so their text is easy to see
<Ingwaz> they have to be seen sometimes to let people know to stop stuff
<emangamer> PhrozenFire: no why would we? (DONT YOU /DARE/)
<IngloriousPony89> I wouldn't hate Pgrozen but I'd be jelly
<Randomnerd> No, because cupcakes are sweet and tasty.
<Lord_of_Beards> WHAT in the blazes is #brony?
<Silverscreen> ...isn't that Banjo Kazooi music?
<IngloriousPony89> Phrozen*
<emangamer> Lord_of_Beards: PLEASE dont ask
<NullRadix> yes, banjo kazooie music
<Lord_of_Beards> That place is a den of inequitity for sure!
<zeppony> but doesn't the webchat client show who has chanop status? my client does
<Ingwaz> it seems to be an unmoderated channel Lord_of_Beards
<Dashie_Dashie> Banjo and kazooie music?
<IshBestPony> dat Banjo Kazzoie music
<IngloriousPony89> Gah! Lag!
<Randomnerd> And I can only scoff at people that need to be gross, because they're embarassed to watch a kid's show.
<PhrozenFire> can someone tell me where I can find some bronies near my area?
<Leo> i hope there will be a day when the two aren't seemingly at eachothers throats
<Lord_of_Beards> Ingwaz: I believe you are correct, HOW can it be?
<Lady_Canary> Did someone ping me before? My connection derped on me.
<Ingwaz> how can what be?
<zeppony> #brony is ponychat's premier channel
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14>listen to 8-bit becoming popular
<zeppony> not unmoderated, just less strict
<Leo> PhrozenFire, you can always check facebook is you have one
<Lord_of_Beards> LESS strict?
<PhrozenFire> Well
<PhrozenFire> I found all my brony friends on facebook
<zeppony> yeh. basically anything goes except hate.
<Lord_of_Beards> We are not that strict to begin with
<Ingwaz> zeppony: considering i've seen people use the N word and no one raised an objection, thats probably unmoderated
<Dashie_Dashie> oh lawd MOLESTIA
<Silverscreen> ....
*Randomnerd pauses the stream because lag is not fun.
<zeppony> no, it's not unmoderated
<zeppony> there's a dickhead named Sebas who goes around being a dick to everybody
<IngloriousPony89> Molestia as the hunter? Nice.
<zeppony> he's gotten kickbanned a few times
<DeadpoolDash> who streaming?
<Lord_of_Beards> Wrek is
<Midnight_Tempest> wrek
<Silverscreen> Molestia vs. Vagineer vs. Painis Cupcake.
<zeppony> making people feel worthless and stuff
<Ingwaz> uhoh....molestia
<Leo> #brony has is nearly without limit to what you can do.. a place like this can seem restrictive
<emangamer> DerpyHooves`: do you lave a link? I can't find it
<Randomnerd> Anyway, yeah, they're a different crowd. No point talking to them.
<Randomnerd> I'd rather stay here and talk cartoons.
<Silverscreen> Saw?
<RAWRity> alright, Got the names I needed from brony.
<zeppony> rule 34 links get posted all the time, but that's because when you watch a show for little girls there's really not much you can say about what people can and can't like
<Ingwaz> indeed Leo, the rules here can be a little strict in some cases, but for the most part, so long as you're not a jerk you're fine
<RAWRity> they just gave me the material I needed.
<StinkomanFan> Giant ponies!
<Leo> mhm
<IngloriousPony89> Flutterbitch! :D
<zeppony> i just always feel like i'm being judged here. that doesn't happen in #brony
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity what are you going to do with those names?
<Dovahkiin> Nooo Ads, i hate ads
<Randomnerd> Different strokes for different folks :)
<Nyria> Leo: There is differnce between restritive and uncivil, but I respect your opinions~
<RAWRity> fluttercry: you'll see~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<Silverscreen> ...
<PhrozenFire> buy everypony, brony, pegasis, and other people.
<Leo> oh gawd.. ads are awful
<Silverscreen> Sexy, Sassy fluttershy?
<StinkomanFan> Bye
<zeppony> RAWRity: what do you mean "got the names i needed from brony"
<IngloriousPony89> Cya Silverscreen
<zeppony> what names? why did you need them?
<Silverscreen> bye.
<RAWRity> zeppony: you'll see~~~~~~~~~~
<IngloriousPony89> confusion over 900
<Dashie_Dashie> dat twilight
<Ingwaz> well zepp, like i said, the rules here arent so bad so long as you're not posting pron or something
<zeppony> you're not turning into MeepSheep are you?
<zeppony> Ingwaz: some people express themselves in pronz
<RAWRity> zeppony: don't know who that is.
<Fleur> I see no problem with the rules here. They are in no way unreasonable
<emangamer> ^
<Silverscreen> ^^
<zeppony> douchebag from dongforc.es IRC that had his dongforce buddies come and spam #brony
<Leo> Nyria, i know about that, but often times the intent behind the words aren't seemingly the ones you would expect
<zeppony> what a cock face
<Ingwaz> well, that may be, but you don't need to make something like that opennly shown to people who may find it offensive
<IshBestPony> bai everypony
<Randomnerd> See ya, IshBestPony
<StinkomanFan> Dat Molestia
<IngloriousPony89> Goodbai IshBestPony
<Lady_Canary> Bai IshBestPony
<TopHat> Can I say nigger?
<Ingwaz> for the most part the rules here are fairly reasonable, perhaps a little strict at times, but reasonable
<Dken2021> laters IshBestPony
<Lord_of_Beards> no
<Ingwaz> no TopHat
<RAWRity> oh nononono. I jsut have it for creative purposes.
<Ingwaz> thats likely to get you kicked/banned
<TopHat> too late
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> bye~ IshBestPony
<zeppony> perhaps a link tagging rule might be better
<zeppony> like [NSFW] and [SPOILER]
<Randomnerd> That isn't my call :-/
<rootPPC64> holy jesus
<Ingwaz> i disagree on the nsfw part, i'd say keep that out
<Nyria> ta ta IshBestPony ~
<Randomnerd> So, Ponies are pretty cool.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dat Trixie~
<emangamer> Ingwaz: but wrek is in this room
<Silverscreen> No NSFW is not a hard rule to follow.
<TopHat> ya?
*IshBestPony hugs Randomnerd and IngloriousPony89 and Lady_Canary and Dken2021 and TheGreatAndPowerfulT and Nyria and Fleur
<Shizuka> 13rule 34 is not allowed in bronystate and related channels, it's not hard
<emangamer> mfw I read that is "Not Save From Wrek"
*Randomnerd hugs back.
*IngloriousPony89 hugs IshBestPony back
<StinkomanFan> This is silly
<Randomnerd> lol emangamer
<Ingwaz> ponies are more than just cool Randomnerd, theyre at least 20% cooler, so, theyre pretty awesome
<Fleur> What we should do is, keep the rules like it is and stay PG13
<emangamer> can we stop talking about the /bad/ channels please?
<Silverscreen> omg.
*Ingwaz facehoofs at emangamer

<Lord_of_Beards> Shizuka: that channel, is like the evil negative counterpart to here it seems...
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT hugs back
*kirzstryfe noms TopHat's hat
<zeppony> #brony isn't a bad channel. a lot of the network admins hang out there
<Silverscreen> All we need now is Creepy Scout.
<Randomnerd> The secret to my safety from wrek is I'm so ugly, no one wants to imagine me naked :D
<IngloriousPony89> Pain is in dat anus
<Fleur> It shouldnt even be an argument tbh

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Hey MakerDusk! You in here?
*TOY_PON3|Ghost floats around once more
<Tovler> I feel blue
<NullRadix> I know blender takes about 1.5 seconds to render each frame when It's building the animation...
<sandvich> I'd say 2000 poly might be the limit. Of course, depends on the comp
<TOY_PON3|Ghost> dat daribot
<NullRadix> but it can also run the animation at full speed in the normal 3D view
<sandvich> So what is the model gonna be for?
<MirrorImage> oh god that second comic... so much wat

<Quadrenaro> and try to convert him
<Phase4> HI SaxyPretender !!!!

<Nittany_Discord> I have a pony profile on GameFront. Don't really care who does what.
<LadyCanary> Dammit kirzstryfe dont make me get the vaccum cleaner under there!
<Quadrenaro> unfortunatly my friends list is huge
<Kimori> the spyro soundtrack and the half poster are the rare ones in the picture
<Quadrenaro> and half are haters
<Quadrenaro> they saw my post, and figured it was open season
<DeadpoolDash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEMD28MMtNg
<Nittany_Discord> Have answered to misconceptions though.
<Quadrenaro> any way in one day we got over a 1000 replies of hat
<Quadrenaro> hate*
<Kyle113> Yeah...I dont think I have ever seen a poster and never known they had a soundtrack
<Nittany_Discord> Some guy posted a thread on bronies. Had half of the "facts" wrong.
<MirrorImage> and 3000 posts of support?
<Quadrenaro> though to be honest we havent had many haters bother us latley
<Kimori> I didnt either
<RAWRity> oh hey, the Giants won.
<Phase4> http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/forum/threadview/2832654624772278002/ << link to what Quadrenaro is talking about
<Quadrenaro> yep
<SaxyPretender> 0,14There's one hater in my Fighting Game Club
<Kimori> posters are very rare to come by, expect to pay a lot if you want to buy it
<Nittany_Discord> And cited G1 as what bronies watch.
<Kimori> as for the soundtrack..
<MirrorImage> last page on that topic - 404
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I put up something about Fighting is Magic being considered for EVO
<Kimori> I probably wouldnt sell it for less than $100
<Phase4> a post on page 404 "I can't hear you over the sound of DERPY'S CANON STATUS!"
<Quadrenaro> lol
<Nittany_Discord> "The mods have slippery ban hammers."
<Kyle113> Yeah...havnt even seen one yet and the soundtrack they are pry rare and non existant
<Nittany_Discord> So, post ponies, get banned from playing EA games.
<Quadrenaro> im UMAD12_sniper atm
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and he was complaining about how "fighting is getting wimpied [not the exact word he used]"
<Kimori> but I dont plan to, its one of the few things ive got thats uncommon
<LadyCanary> ...Wooooooow.
<Quadrenaro> im a hater trying to become a brony but now everyone is just being lazy : P
<Quadrenaro> and not trying to convert
<Phase4> "no ponies are gay" << this meens so little its funny
<Quadrenaro> lol
<Kyle113> Yeah I hear you...I wouldnt want to either lol how much did you pay for it?
<Quadrenaro> my only regret is i couldnt really fight in the war
<Quadrenaro> i was egging the haters on
<TOY_PON3> ugh forget it
<Quadrenaro> i got a bunch of friend requesrs
<Phase4> i choose to interpret that as (no ponies) are (gae, 'objectionable'), wich makes it praise for ponies
*TOY_PON3 turns back to life

<otakon> I've named it Wheely
<Kencolt> I wonder if they still make Bufferin?
<Sumica> 00,10it was tracking a minimized window
<RAWRity> derpy_pony: how so?
<Wolftooth> Q.Q Wheely scaares me.
<Yahooz> Ive named it loading_wheel.exe
<derpy_pony> she should be more than the comic relief
<otakon> derpy_pony: you might be right, Saturn is saying the same thing
<otakon> but we HAVE seen her serious before
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: i'm keeping them warm for her!
<Phase4> ...
<Wolftooth> OH GOD
<Yahooz> Dont break dat pinky promise
<bluestrom_S> god I'm addicted to these vidoes
<Wolftooth> Oh
<bluestrom_S> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJP11_BkU8Q
<RAWRity> derpy_pony: and she is, in other episodes. Other times, she's comic relief, just like the others.
<Wolftooth> Ok.
<otakon> and being a silly pony is what she has always been
*Saturn 8,1flies shy's colours

<Saturn> 8,1she said it was cool.
<otakon> Yahooz: Shy isn't here atm
<otakon> lol
<RAWRity> derpy_pony: because she doesn't get episodes that often.

<Kimori> yup
<otakon> Seriously though, they have black and white tv
<Kimori> although..
<RAWRity> derpy_pony: plenty of people were asking for it on here. as well as for FLuttershy.
<Yahooz> Batman could figure his way out of a straight jacket with no hands
<Kimori> I wish it would be the same with car related stuff :P

<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think this is a direct adaption of a Silver Age story
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX21HyZGpp8
<Tovler> Batrave
<otakon> ah
<Kimori> ive got the exact same car

<Sumica> 00,10that man......he has no eyes
<Kencolt> Pretty cruse cybernetis-- more like a control system similar to an amputee's claw.
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: nah. if it was, there'd be more Aliens.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that forms a HUUUUGE basis of Grant morrison's first act of his Batman Mega-arc
<Yahooz> guy in a bat suit probably should be in an asylum
<derpy_pony> especcialy if he is unconscous
<Yahooz> just saying
<derpy_pony> +i
<Tovler> batatonic state
<Phase4> because no one ever sees the bat actualy saving people
<otakon> eeyup
<Phase4> must be a delusion
<Yahooz> +o : D
*Sumica lobs a brick at Tovler
<otakon> yeah, like you can beat the bat
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...but yeah, RAWRity, this seems like Batman Begins XD
<Yahooz> dat plot
<Kyle113> Lol that would be awesome
<Kimori> its a 4 cylinder btw
<derpy_pony> pre information age heroes
<otakon> this is the other way around
<Kyle113> Yeah I kinda guessed
<RAWRity> um..he DIDN'T come to arkham.
<Kimori> which is awesome, the gas milage would still be good
<otakon> nope
<Phase4> as if someone could escape arkham
<otakon> just crashed on the way to where he was going
<otakon> and THATS why he doesn't believe him
<Kyle113> Yeag...I get like 19 MPG
<derpy_pony> forever
<Kimori> yeah but its an SUV
<otakon> where does he get the money for this stuff?
<Phase4> theft
<Kencolt> Arkham Security has more holes than a wheel of swiss cheese.
<derpy_pony> lower personnel knows about the prisoners...bad organization
<Yahooz> dat face reveal
<otakon> yeah, and The Scarecrow got a new look in this episode too
<Phase4> how do they get out of arkham, is that ever explained?
<Yahooz> suddenly no straight jacket
<otakon> much more scary looking since his first appearance
<Sumica> 00,10they used the plot exit
<RAWRity> Phase4: easy, Arkham sucks shit.
<Kyle113> Yep...after I get some of the work done should be better...the EGR valve which is bad will help it a bit
<derpy_pony> I want this drug
<Yahooz> they used Pinkie.java
<Kimori> so your suv is still at the shop?
<otakon> yeah, The Scarecrows gas is a REALLLY powerful hallucigenic
<Yahooz> kaboo--- oh
<RAWRity> but for a really freaky Batman story, read "Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth"
<Phase4> i'm going to assume this is a video game and they have console access
<otakon> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10mindfuck much
<Yahooz> dat gun
<otakon> it's a giant bleeding gun
<Yahooz> BFG much?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Batman's tripping balls, it seems
<derpy_pony> the have full plot access...without the pony interpretation
<otakon> eeyup
<Kyle113> No I brought it home...they said to bring it to the dealer
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai :3
<Kimori> so they didnt do anything?
<RAWRity> you think this is a mindfuck? read that story I suggested. It's Grant Morrison at his crackiest.
<Yahooz> dat supple
<Kyle113> Nope they said the computer is bad they think...they drove it
<Yahooz> *supply
<Sumica> 00,10giant river runs under prison gg
<Yahooz> supple lolz
<derpy_pony> arkham severs are everywhere
<otakon> yeah
<derpy_pony> sewers?
<Kimori> how can the computer be bad if its drivable?
<derpy_pony> too drunk to look it up now
<otakon> God, I love Arkham Asylum that game is great
<Kyle113> Thats exactly what I said but everyone even in my family says its possible
<RAWRity> >Is told Villain is going to destory the city
<RAWRity> >Drugs and imprisons superhero
<RAWRity> This is the worst Doctor ever.
<Phase4> i'm not convinced he's a scientist
<derpy_pony> just shoot him
<Tovler> ballet kick
<Kyle113> I would think it would be misfiring everywhere and it wouldnt know what to do and certainly not hold or know codes
<derpy_pony> even batman isn't immune to a bullet in the head
<Kimori> its misfiring when you drive?
<Phase4> batman can escape arkham
<doctor_whooves127> controled madness thats like organised chaos
<otakon> RAWRity: Craine is a scientist and psychologist with an obsession about Fear and it's causes and effects.
<otakon> god
<RAWRity> otakon: I'm not talking about Craine
<Phase4> .....an axe?
<otakon> oh
<Kyle113> No...it says it is but it doesnt feel like it. It does shake and rattle a bit but you know its olf
<Kyle113> old*
<RAWRity> I'm talking about this shitty doctor assigned to batman.
<otakon> idiots let him keep his utility belt
<Kimori> it rattles bad?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Scarecrow is best Sinestro Corps member
<Kyle113> No not bad just a bit
<derpy_pony> they have like 3 types of security people in this show...and they all look the same
<Yahooz> "He might go insane without it!"
<otakon> lol
<Yahooz> woah
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: damn straight.

<Yahooz> Acccccciiiiiiiiddddddd tttttrrrrrrriiiiiiiipppppp
<Kimori> thats a very bad sign
<otakon> yeah, this part creeped me the hell out as a kid
<RAWRity> even though Blackest Night as a whole was pretty underwhelming, that part was pretty awesome.
<otakon> so very much
<Kimori> I had to replace a computer chip in my car before, its very expensive
<Yahooz> Fuckery times 1000
<Phase4> p-n-gwin
<otakon> moar like 1000
<otakon> 10000
<derpy_pony> I found it boring as a kid
