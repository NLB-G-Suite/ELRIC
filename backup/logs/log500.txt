<TheWhitePlague> The end
<Crono_brony> Bronysith: I heard of the name of the game, and i just loved the word "chrono" so i just removed the "h" and used crono for everything.
<CriticKitten> So let's recap: Child defies space and time by going into outer space. Diablo talks to him telling him to visit the ship. He escapes by hiding in DerpyBot, and NASA's crack team of expert guards doesn't notice.
<TheWhitePlague> :'(

<DeathStar> Saturn: get her to buy you a pony
<ponibas> a phd and she opted for 70k??
<DerpStar> A Purple Pony
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it's part of a new strategy that companies are rolling with. Instead of grabbing people who have finished their degrees, they're picking the talented ones out and paying them higher wages to convince them to quit their degree early..

<Inquisitor> I just love it when one of the mods plays a previous generation pony vid, on new EP days... the chat room explodes
<noodliepoodlie> lyra is best human
<Saturn> 08,01y'know what?
<DeathStar> Inquisitor: it's so much fun ^-^
<MahBoi777> ohai CupcakeWarrior, how are you?
<CupcakeWarrior> Hai
<Saturn> 08,01i think Teachers' Unions are one of the worst thigns to happen to education
<noodliepoodlie> *nods in agreement*
<gaige> yes
<geeky-brony> and how hasbro messd up celstaeas toy http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/27000000/Totally-something-I-would-do-princess-luna-27045576-500-396.jpg
<CriticKitten> Saturn: I can name two things worse.
<Ponies47> No stream :(
<Inquisitor> I agree Saturn.... it kept one teacher I knew employed who thought Brittish Columbia was in South America
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWm9MXwMgag
<CriticKitten> 1) Adminstration.
<Ponies47> Watch this :)
<CriticKitten> 2) Politicians.
<Saturn> 08,01and don't get me wrong; my politics are generally leaning to the left-wing
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.derpyhoovesnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/006_i_mean_it_by_tehjadeh-d52kipy.png
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: :D
<TheWhitePlague> G2G
<CriticKitten> Oh don't get me wrong, I don't disagree with you.
<TheWhitePlague> Bye Everypony
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: the Unions are the administration, generally
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: :D
<Ponies47> Bye bye TheWhitePlague :)
<Sylandest> night, TheWhitePlague
<geeky-brony> nith TheWhitePlague
<Saturn> 08,01and the politicians affect the administration
<CriticKitten> I just think if we're going to focus on the biggest problem? Start with those two.
<CriticKitten> Er, no, not really Saturn
<Ponies47> I'm Derpylicious! :P
*CupcakeWarrior pets CrimsonPhoenix
<Diglett> politics and ponys dont mix
<CrimsonPhoenix> Heh?
<CriticKitten> The adminstration would be folks like the principals, superintendents, etc.
<Saturn> 08,01but I think the way in which the Unions work actually disadvantage good teachers
<Ponies47> Noms on CupcakeWarrior
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: if ur links are too long, use this site http://derpy.me/ it helps
<CupcakeWarrior> :<
<CriticKitten> Aka the people who push all of the blame onto teachers.
<DeathStar> Diglett: then what dose celestia do?
<Saturn> 08,01because they want to be fair to the majority, which means that exceptional teachers don't get recognition, or extra compensation
<geeky-brony> ok MahBoi777
<Saturn> 08,01and therefore have less incentive
<BroKnee> MahBoi777: Spank you
<MahBoi777> lol
<CriticKitten> Er, I'm not sure I agree with that either
<BroKnee> :3
<CupcakeWarrior> I like ponies :3
<BroKnee> Same /)
<CriticKitten> The concern with merit pay is not that it rewards exceptional teachers (which it doesn't).
<adasdad> is the stream over or am i just laggy?
<DeathStar> CupcakeWarrior: :O really? me too!
<SunderlandPony89> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=YsJuNQTZhQk
<CriticKitten> It's that it punishes teachers for things they can't control.
*CupcakeWarrior hugs DeathStar
<noodliepoodlie> anypony here still using WINdows xp?
<Ponies47> nope.avi
<Ponies47> Windows 7 :P
<RyunosukeKnT> hmm
<BroKnee> Windows 7 FTW /)
<RyunosukeKnT> I wonder....
<ponibas> noodliepoodlie: do you have a question about XP?
<Ponies47> BroKnee: (\
*RyunosukeKnT tries something
<noodliepoodlie> yeahh
<ponibas> shoot
<DeathStar> RyunosukeKnT: what are you trying?
<noodliepoodlie> how do i get to microsoft sam
<CriticKitten> Merit pay is a wonderful idea which has been twisted into a system whereby good teachers get the same pay for many many years, while the administration rake in more money.
<Inquisitor> well guys, I probably should get some sleep, got work in the afternoon tomorrow, and I need to clean up the fallout from my second monitor's purchase
<Polydunami> Changed clients to Nettalk. Hey there everypony! n_n
<DeathStar> RyunosukeKnT: dose it involve dance?
<Inquisitor> night everyone
<noodliepoodlie> good night
<Spectrum_Rush> hai Polydunami
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: hmm, yes, i agree with you there
<geeky-brony> http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/10855
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey Polydunami
<BroKnee> Night :3
<Diglett> nothing
<CriticKitten> It's actually been calculated that, in my state, I'm going to get a pay cut to keep my job.
<RyunosukeKnT> it might actually, and you will have to wait to see if it gets picked ;)
<MahBoi777> hey Polydunami! how are you?
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: move to england
<Saturn> 08,01you'll be paid more
<noodliepoodlie> makes sense
<Polydunami> Hey MahBoi777
<Polydunami> I'm doing well
<CriticKitten> Aye but that's my point, Saturn.
<MahBoi777> good
<noodliepoodlie> AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!
<Ponies47> I'm gonna go take a shower. Be back in a bit :p
<noodliepoodlie> just spilled hot ramen on my lap
<Polydunami> Egad
<Diglett> sad
<noodliepoodlie> >:(
<CriticKitten> The US wants to "fix" education by making teaching less desirable, awarding poorer pay, higher restrictions, and making it easier to fire you.
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: dem crazy youngins
<DeathStar> noodliepoodlie: that's not good
<CriticKitten> Don't YOU want to become a teacher under those conditions?
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: lol
<BroKnee> noodliepoodlie: I hate it when i do that ):
<RyunosukeKnT> I tried to look for rules about what I could and could not submit for BMN, I found nothing regarding what I was looking for :)
<CriticKitten> I don't disagree that unions have done a lot of damage, but the policies being put in place?
<MahBoi777> noodliepoodlie: how fitting, but OUCH
<CriticKitten> They're going to swing the pendulum rapidly back the other direction.
<CountDoofus> *pokes in head* Hello...
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, forgot to send in my lottery pics :$
<BroKnee> Hello CountDoofus :D
<DeathStar> RyunosukeKnT: what is it? TELL ME! (please if you don't mind)
<CriticKitten> And suddenly we'll go from "major shortage of science and math teachers" to "major shortage of teachers PERIOD".
<noodliepoodlie> STREAM! WHY YOU NO WORK????
<MahBoi777> hello CountDoofus
<RyunosukeKnT> if it gets picked, you will know, trust me
<Rain> noodliepoodlie, because nobody is streaming >_>
<Polydunami> Oh hey CountDoofus :3
<MahBoi777> noodliepoodlie: the buffer show is on
<MahBoi777> hi Rain
<DeathStar> noodliepoodlie: it's the buffershow! silly
<CriticKitten> Why get a job in teaching if an equal job in a private outlet pays far more?
<BroKnee> I love the buffer show :D
<CriticKitten> We're going to ruin our education system.
<CriticKitten> Just you watch.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01buffers BroKnee
<Diglett> can we chang the channel
<noodliepoodlie> for me its a black screen with the circly-dot thingy

<MahBoi777> BroKnee: best show evar amirite?
<noodliepoodlie> no im not new here
<Polydunami> Oh.

<noodliepoodlie> its that i have a black screen
<BroKnee> MahBoi777: Not better than MLP ^.^ /)
<MahBoi777> true
<GabeMoist> noodliepoodlie, because no one is playing anything
<Diglett> agreed
<MahBoi777> (\
<SunderlandPony89> CriticKitten: We're gonna ruin our education system by doing nothing... which is exactly what we're doing
<BroKnee> 2nd best tho

<noodliepoodlie> not new
<Shizuka> 13so i have a dilemma
<CriticKitten> Oh no, we're not doing nothing.
<CupcakeWarrior> What shizu?
<CriticKitten> We're making a bad problem worse.
<Diglett> well i prefer static show for 3rd
<GabeMoist> CriticKitten, that's all we know how to do
<BroKnee> *Grabs notpad* What is it Shizuka?
<SunderlandPony89> CriticKitten: You are talking about the education system in the US right?
<Spectrum_Rush> do tell Shizuka
<DeathStar> what is it Shizuka

<Shizuka> 13and i really have no idea why i want to stream it so bad...
<Sylandest> laters, LoyalDash
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: see, that's what's putting me off a career in education. i could be earning very very large amounts of money doing computery stuff for large companies. but honestly, so long as i can pay my bills, i'd probably be happier as a teacher, at least for a few years
<SunderlandPony89> Do what you want Shizuka
<CupcakeWarrior> kirzstryfe: Someone keeps getting kicked?
<BroKnee> Just do it :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would LOVE an episode with this http://derpy.me/rbQLH

<CriticKitten> SunderlandPony89: Yep. And we're not doing nothing, look at the Midwest! Where you can't negotiate things like: working conditions, maximum hours of work or overtime pay, class size limitations, or such things.

<Glacymr> hi
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just remember one of the tragiest scene in Disney history :'(
<CriticKitten> Teaching is steadily becoming a worse profession to be in.
<Shamroc> Phase4: it was a f2p M1+W pyro
<Diglett> be back tomorrow for alien 2
<SunderlandPony89> CriticKitten: Woah waoh woah, how the hell does it idolizes the lottery system? It was pointing out how broken the current public education because of the difference in quality between public and private schools (I hope to God I know what you mean by idolize, otherwise I'm gonna look like a moron :P)
<Lighty> 13hey
<CriticKitten> I myself might not stay with it for too much longer.

<CriticKitten> SunderlandPony89: Except that what the documentary doesn't tell you is that most private institutions perform equal to their public counterparts, barring several major urban areas....and the problems there go far deeper than the education.
<geeky-brony> ok what did i miss my laptop derped on me

<GabeMoist> Joe NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<SirGanjalf> mornin' everypony
<CriticKitten> SunderlandPony89: It really depends on the region. Urban areas tend to perform more poorly due to their schools being flooded with children who purposely fail the tests or can't take them, thus counting against that school.

<Prick> oh wat!, oh mai i havent seen twister in ages
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: I knew what you were playing 1 second in.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, do twisters really roar?
<Shizuka> 13once the action starts up i'll kick in volume leveling
<Polydunami> I think I've seen this movie.
<CupcakeWarrior> I bet Nittany loves this movie :D
<kirzstryfe> I watched E3 last week, had a good nap

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Oh no its the Death Eatdrs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CupcakeWarrior: It's a meterological joke.
<CriticKitten> Shizuka: Challenge accepted. ACTIVATE RIFF MODE.
<SunderlandPony89> CriticKitten: Acting smart is to hard nowadays, so we might as well let our own biases get in the way of our better judgement! Because great advances in the human race were made that way!
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: happens more often then you think
<Sumica> 00,10lies they roar and hate pickups, readnecks and trailer parks

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Nittany_Discord: a meterological joke WHERE!?!?
<Shizuka> 13it's a really quiet rip i've noticed, but much higher quality than the last one i had video-wise
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Gary England.
<Phase4> 00,02dat twister
<GabeMoist> ....crap....I just realized that I missed the movies of tonight....
<CriticKitten> Oh god, the tornado's roaring at them already

<Ponies47> Ohai Phase4 :)
<Sumica> 00,10that's where the sound mixer in MPC comes in nicely Shizuka
<CriticKitten> DON'T YOU FEEL THE TENSION
<Polydunami> This is a previous tornado, I think
<TheRareP0N3> seems like rainbow dash forgot to take out the clouds..
<pony_1664> all I hear is rawr
<BroKnee> It just started storming IRL o.O
<Phase4> 00,02ohai
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The movie was great when I first saw it.
<CriticKitten> DON'T ABANDON THE DOG
<geeky-brony> puuppy

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now it's ridiculous.

<HiImSpike> hey everybrony
<TheRareP0N3> how did it spawn that quick?
<CriticKitten> GOOD DESIGN
<geeky-brony> night SunderlandPony89 my the froce be with u
<MahBoi777> run chickens!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The TV says it's an F5 (when they didn't even know how to detect tornadoes).
<SunderlandPony89> Later Bronystate!
<BroKnee> Hello KiImSpike
<CrimsonPhoenix> and say I loved this movie before
<MahBoi777> bye SunderlandPony89! take care
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: seems legit
<Polydunami> How about ninety minutes of Ryan Reynolds in a box buried in the middle of nowhere?
<Sumica> 00,10it's a shelter from things that show up quickly, lets put it 200 yards from the house.
<Ponies47> Bye bye SunderlandPony89 :)
<Ponies47> Hey HiImSpike :)
<MahBoi777> YAY
<Rain> dat twister
<HiImSpike> wat are we watching
<Shizuka> 13well not to mention the persistent calling them an Fn tornado when you don't do that until after the damage is assessed
<CriticKitten> TOBY?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Radar tornado detection didn't start until 1970 ot do.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*so
<CriticKitten> The dog confirmed for Tobuscus
<HiImSpike> hey Ponies47
<MahBoi777> Toby lives, all is well
*SunderlandPony89 hugs geeky-brony, MahBoi777, Ponies47 :)
<Shizuka> 13silly shizu, it said 1969 right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Fujita scale wasn't invented yet.
<Ponies47> Hugs SunderlandPony89 back :)
<Sumica> 00,10they have always gestamated those Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13not just that
<Polydunami> Even better, ninety minutes of twelve men in a room arguing.
<MahBoi777> hang on!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> they should had made the cellar 2 levels
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Two months after the outbreak that Fujita studied.
<CriticKitten> In retrospect maybe it was stupid of me to make the storm cellar door out of plywood and a shitty rusty lock
<Shizuka> 13storm shelters were typically built for nuclear sheltering too weren't they?
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: I liked this movie the first time, but right after I watched, I realized how stupid it was
<Polydunami> Nuts.
<HiImSpike> noooooo
<Shizuka> 13but yeah, flimsy wooden door, windows everywhere
<Shizuka> 13the moral of the story
<CriticKitten> LET HER RUN OUT INTO THE STORM
<Shizuka> 13jo's father was stupid
<TheRareP0N3> MMMMEEEEEDDDDIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCC!!!!!!!!
<CriticKitten> IF YOU DO, THE MOVIE WILL BE OVER
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: ikr
<CriticKitten> DAMNIT

<Shamroc> dat troll ass bir
<Shamroc> d
<Sumica> 00,10would not matter if they had no door.
<Prick> bad enough i still have nightmares about this movie
<Shizuka> 13jo and mommy were just fine why didn't he stay back?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: theres no way a tornado would have pulled them out of the shelter
<TheRareP0N3> present day.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Why do we need rifftrax when we have bronystate chat :3
<CriticKitten> Ion cannon activated
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're on GOES 13 now.
<Shizuka> 13i like that random bass dive there
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, that's what I was wondering
<Sumica> 00,10the twister can suck you out if there is no way for the air to flow through
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: failed physics
<Ponies47> Throws a medic at TheRareP0N3
<Sumica> 00,10cant*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Meanwhile in Canada
<Shizuka> 13i know most of the goofs in filming here now, watch the side of the truck for the helicopter taking this shot
<TheRareP0N3> oh no
<TheRareP0N3> nature happens
<Sumica> 00,10shame there is no riff
<HiImSpike> hey Sumica :$
<Shizuka> 13also, watch behind them, there's cars behind even though this is clearly a deserted road
<Ponies47> CAHT DERP HOLD ON
<CriticKitten> Oh no! If the Cells keep building, they'll have a record number of DBZ episodes showing on cable!
<Polydunami> ...
<Shizuka> 13these subs aren't fantastic, if most want them off just ask~
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Record dBZ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We might hit 80.
<TheRareP0N3> seeya guys, going to bed
<CriticKitten> Exposition~
<Polydunami> They don't get in the way, Shizuka.
<TheRareP0N3> tired
<Ponies47> That's better
<Sumica> 00,10no worse then some of the B's we hand Shizuka
<Ponies47> :)
<MahBoi777> gnight TheRareP0N3
<Shizuka> 13when this radar hits 88dBZ, you're gonna see some serious twist
<HiImSpike> bue bue TheRareP0N3
<CriticKitten> And this is all you'll ever get of his wife's character~
<TheRareP0N3> bai.
<geeky-brony> nitht TheRareP0N3
<Polydunami> Twist is underrated. :|
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: ;D
<Ponies47> Night night TheRareP0N3 :)
<Spriggals> I like twisters
<Sumica> 00,10such as the one where we could see the cameraman reflecting in car windows
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> She said a bad word
<Sumica> 00,10and it was a sony handi cam
<Spectrum_Rush> *:D
<Shizuka> 13that's true
<MahBoi777> what a twist
<Shizuka> 13throughout the movie they have trouble keeping the sky consistent
<Spriggals> ...
<BroKnee> Anyone wana play any games?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Give the dry line a push up a hill.
<Shizuka> 13sometimes it's way overcast, other times it's beautiful blue like this, also hi cameron did ferris bring you out here?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*down
<Polydunami> Hello, BroKnee. I would like to play a game.
<geeky-brony> rool the maps
<CriticKitten> Don't fold the maps and don't split the party!
<Polydunami> Wait, that was a reference.

<Shizuka> 13philip seymour hoffman everyone
<CriticKitten> So I think I'll call you....Awkward Comedy Relief Man
<BroKnee> So you don't? D:
<CountDoofus> I can't help but think the pony level in Diablo 3 is a major trolling by Blizzard.
<Shizuka> 13and then joey is ignored for the rest of the film
<geeky-brony> meow
<gaige> poor joey
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CountDoofus: Their DRM is trolling enough.
<CrimsonPhoenix> CountDoofus, do you know about the cow level in Diablo2?
<Ponies47> BRB I'm gonna go make some popcorn
<CountDoofus> CrimsonPhoenix: yeap.
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: awesome
<HiImSpike> kk Ponies47
<CriticKitten> Yeah, we did see the sky earlier, didn't look like that
<Polydunami> She looks a little like Meg Ryan to me.
<CriticKitten> Stock footage of storms much?
<CrimsonPhoenix> then how is Pony level trolling?
<Polydunami> A little.
<Spriggals> Joey is like me...Seen once and left alone :)
<Spectrum_Rush> look at the size of that laptop
<Shizuka> 13oh there's a good one later, the hailstorm hill buildup has like five different highways, one of which is clearly a texas highway
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Note: SPC and local offices do the storm monitoring. Chasers are in-tuned with those people.
<MahBoi777> it's huge
<Shizuka> 13they're in oklahoma

<CrimsonPhoenix> I think I got the best B movie of choice yet
<Om> They psycologist needs tharapy
<geeky-brony> BroKnee: awesome
<Polydunami> ... They were almost killed.
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: awesome
<MahBoi777> I know u guys almost died and all but that was freakin awesome man!
<BroKnee> geeky-brony no....not awesome

*Nittany_Discord 11,01flies
<Shizuka> 13i think it's funny it isn't until the triplet waterspouts that melissa freaks out about bill's "chasing tornadoes" not being a metaphor for something
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wendys
<Shizuka> 13and it's not until the drive in that she gives up
<geeky-brony> lol i like that guy
<MahBoi777> kissy kissy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What would chasing tornadoes be a metaphor for?
<Om> Woo!
<Polydunami> I don't care who it is; if it's not a good vs. evil movie, death is not really awesome.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ll
<Spriggals> He dies
<Shizuka> 13melissa is pretty stupid throughout though... right here i would have spotted that bill's back in love with jo
<Shizuka> 13that grinning no way
<Spriggals> Does anyone die in this movie?
<Polydunami> How?
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: Well tornados kill....So death?
<CriticKitten> "Losers"? You're down one truck and had no luck with your experiment, yeah no
<CriticKitten> YOU are the losers, Dusty
<Polydunami> Chasing tornadoes is a metaphor for foolhardiness.
<hen3ry> dat liability
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: well considering this epic storm system never before seen only produces... eight tornadoes?
<MahBoi777> wonder how much they get paid :/
<Polydunami> ... I'm feeling a little foolhardy.
<HiImSpike> good to know Polydunami
<Shizuka> 13over the course of two days i think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And this is me.
<Iron_Edge> MahBoi777: To chase tornados? -lol-
<Iron_Edge> MahBoi777: Not enough..
<Shizuka> 13they picked good vehicles for the heroes convoy
<MahBoi777> indeed
<Merc_Xephos> wtf

<MahBoi777> Tornadoes, Tornadoes everywhere
<Ponies47> Night night Polydunami :)
<CriticKitten> Shizuka: Yeah, that's sorta the point though. They're down one vehicle and are acting like they "won"? What would've happened if the EVIL CORPORATE GUY got the next one?
<CriticKitten> Then THEY won
*geeky-brony hugs MahBoi777 cya
<Polydunami> I'm not leaving.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Look. Radar in clear-air mode.

<Spriggals> I knew it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When the F5 throws the tanker at them.
<HiImSpike> owww doesnt that hurt
<Shizuka> 13i think this is the bluray copy, but obviously scaled down in size a bit

<Shizuka> 13now... 1996... and they're building a platform to send into a tornado and keep radioing back information
<Alchemist> I was in an epic hail one summer. It hurts like hell and makes people panic...
<xxMoopyxx> oh shit there it is

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what would police be doing?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6see, this is why I like Florida, 90% of our weather is predictable
<HiImSpike> shoot the tornado
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Police be policin'
<Shizuka> 13it's important to serve the whole "we had no warning" thing.. but you'd think you'd get more of a second or two before the scene changed...
<xxMoopyxx> oh hey spike did you tell rainbow dash what i sayed?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6hurricane? see that coming a week early
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tornadoes are predictable.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6thunderstorms? 3pm every afternoon in the summer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Except on where it's going.
<MadSurge> Indeed Shizuka
<Midnight_Tempest> twister... why isnt this a rifftrax, that would be awesome
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol-.....pwnium I see what they did thar.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: yup... they know that Tornadoes happen every day
<MahBoi777> save the food!

<Ponies47> Bye HiImSpike :)
<Spectrum_Rush> she didnt love you
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> At least she's honest
<Shizuka> 13well when you get into your local weather station being geared up for storm tracking, they usually seem to identify the tornado-producing part of the storm and where it'll go, at least in the next hour
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> and not a bitch
<MahBoi777> she ain't evenmad
<Saturn> 08,01so, um, what are you guys watching?
<Shizuka> 13unless that's just me in the twin cities cause we're only like 40 miles end to end
<MahBoi777> Saturn: Twister
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: The SW quadrant of the storm?

<Iron_Edge> Spriggals: :D
<Shizuka> 13i at least remember a year or two ago, one of the storms that had a tornado in hugo
<kirzstryfe> 8,6because Shizuka keeps starting movies at 2am
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, aunt Jo has an hour of warning?
<Om> I have made my laptop charger into a glowy head. tie. thing
<Saturn> 08,01hey Nittany_Discord: i know what your favourite World of Warcraft city is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was in Hugo.
<Saturn> 08,01Ogrimmar.
<Midnight_Tempest> thats not a good reason kirz...
<xxMoopyxx> (:(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01NVM
<Shizuka> 13they'd picked out some part of the storm and was tracking about an hour out where that part would be
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You mean the town.

<Spriggals> Hey I having nothing better to do at 3:21am

<Shizuka> 13yeah, suburb east of here
<oni_link> dat sonic generations soundtrack
<Nicos> isnt that the same gamily from the begining?
<Saturn> 08,01no, see, it was a joke because you all thought i was going to say "Stormwind"...
<Spectrum_Rush> did she died i cant remeber
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> GHOSTS?
<MahBoi777> oh no
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep. 1 hour of warning isn't enough.
<CountDoofus> Oh.
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: :D
<Prick> I...am...FORSAKEN!
<Shizuka> 13suppose i should turn my earbuds down now from the wakita guitar solo X3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Best City is Dalaran
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> before it became crap
<Spriggals> True dat
<Shizuka> 13apparently in one of the exterior shots of the house, you can see the huge cables that were holding it up
<Shizuka> 13even in this rip i still haven't spotted them yet
<Saturn> 08,01my god
<Midnight_Tempest> wow... 96... 16 years old, damn...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was in Minnesota in '07 trying to catch a tornado.
<Saturn> 08,01ponies do not need boobs
<Saturn> 08,01never. ever. ever.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Missed one, sadly. :<

<MahBoi777> O_o
<Iron_Edge> building ready to collapse. Go in anyways. -lol-
<Midnight_Tempest> thought the movie was a bit younger than that...
<Ponies47> Yo Meg. You alright?
*Saturn 08,01shudders
<Alchemist> Saturn: O.O wat?
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol- :D
<Spriggals> Don't worry the dog lives
<Shizuka> 13meg's awesome cause she's all "baaaaah i helped raise a master storm chaser i'm fiiiiine"
<Pwah> she's bleeding ;;
<Midnight_Tempest> everything needs boobs... <_< >_>
<Ponies47> WHAT ABOUT BOOMER!?! :o
<Saturn> 08,01i just found a humanised celestia and luna comic
<Saturn> 08,01and, to be fair, the clothes are all on
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: eww
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wanted to make a movie joke, but screensnapr is broke :<
<Saturn> 08,01and stay on
<Saturn> 08,01but still, it's disconcerting seeing them with those... things...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> She's fine =/
<hen3ry> she looks very fine
<Iron_Edge> I always knew TV would be the death of someone.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TROLL WIRES
*Saturn 08,01is definitely not a boob person
<Spriggals> ITS A MAC
<hen3ry> cable TV saves your life.
<hen3ry> or not
<Pwah> i hear that saturn!
<xxMoopyxx> oh god she busted her skull open
<Ponies47> COME OUT! :[
<Midnight_Tempest> thats a shame Saturn... cause boobies rock
<Alchemist> Saturn: but they were humanised. were the "equipment" too... defined?
<CountDoofus> That's the thing with American housing. Much of it is made of wood. One tornado and it's all gone.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yes... more ppl in a unstable house is best
*Pinkies4thWall doesn't understand boobs
<Shizuka> 13well apart from it being makeup
<Iron_Edge> Saturn: -lol- thats why we love ponys. No boobs. -lol-
<Shizuka> 13it's just a bump you can tell
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> YAY MEG SURVIVED
<xxMoopyxx> oh
<Spectrum_Rush> Meg sont give a fuck
<Spectrum_Rush> *dont
<Saturn> 08,01Midnight_Tempest: i'm more a fan of shags.
<Shizuka> 13being a head bump it would bleed a lot, especially if she was trapped in the basement and not able to clean up
<Saturn> 08,01and bustards.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol dog
<xxMoopyxx> well it looked like she busted her head open

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oooh, a new streamer.
<Shizuka> 13now we're in for it... ghostiestream
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Panda: cause Ghosties is a ghost
<GabeMoist> Ghosties, so Yume Nikki stream will become a reality?
<Om> Finally, that freaking window cracked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What will Ghosties stream?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And what pony will he use?
<Spectrum_Rush> what is this out of context words hour or something
<DeathStar> xxMoopyxx: ladys love the mustash
<Ponies47> Ghosties: It's a boy. I thinking about naming him Soarin :)
<hen3ry> wonder how much pepsi paid to bave their cans be the ones used.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Nittany_Discord: i heard he likes scary shit
<MahBoi777> xxMoopyxx: he has swag
<Panda> Nittany_Discord: lol trademark questions of bronystate?
<Ghosties> 04I probably wouldn't use a desktop pony :P Unless, maybe Vinyl
<CountDoofus> xxMoopyxx: You should see episode the episode "Boast Busters" of MLP, you'll find out.
<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: My second kitty :)
<Shizuka> 13>biggest storm system ever
<Shizuka> 13>produces F5
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi F5.
<Shizuka> 13>broad daylight, no rain
<Ghosties> 04And I'd stream "horror" stuff
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01>Doesn't produce massive outbreak.
<MahBoi777> Ram the Tornado! Avenge your father! it is your destiny
<Panda> Ghosties: O_O horror?
<Pinkies4thWall> Shizuka: seems legit
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: yay? *trembles in fear*
<Rain> no rain?
<Ponies47> Ghosties: :O
<Shamroc> Ghosties: like amnesia and such?
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: -lol- I love animals especially tiny kittehs ^-^
<Ghosties> 04Oh yeah, I'm a huge horror buff :)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Panda: Jump Scares
<xxMoopyxx> oh ok lol but why does pinkie pie have all the food i mean thats not fair to all the ponies in the theater she needs to share
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: hostel?
<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: He's six weeks old. HE'S SO CUTE! :)
<Panda> Ghosties: i will kill you xD dont scare me!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's probably a large storm.
<Ghosties> 04I don't think I'd do movies
<Shizuka> 13watch the road as the camera flies past, you can see the sand and past skidmarks from other takes of that tailspin
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: y not
<Spectrum_Rush> Ghosties: games?
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: haha so much D''awwwwww XD
<Ghosties> 04But shows like Are You Afraid of the Dark, and Goosebumps would get shown from time to time.
<Spectrum_Rush> Ghosties: oh neat
<Panda> Ghosties: i love those shows !
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ghosties: YAY GOOSEBUMPS
<Ghosties> 04Oh, and Courage if I can find eps
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those skidmarks vanished.
<Spectrum_Rush> Ghosties: all my yes
<Panda> Ghosties: want me to find some for you? ^^
<DeathStar> Ghosties: I hope you don't mind if i try not to watch your streams (I'm a huge wimp when it comes to horror)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did you see that?
<Pwah> ERMAHGERD! GERSBERMPS!
<MahBoi777> wow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The skidmarks vanished shortly after made.
<Shizuka> 13magic rubber
<MadSurge> Ghosties: never saw Are You Afraid Of The Dark :O
<Shizuka> 13it...um... blew away?
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: sand was pushed over them i think
<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: I'm thing about naming him Soarin. I want to name him after a pony but kind of hard because it's a boy. I think Soarin would be awesome :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> still 24 minutes =/
<Spectrum_Rush> to light? wont take
<Ghosties> 04Thanks for the help, Panda. I'll let you know if I have any trouble :)
<MadSurge> HAVE A TREE
*Spectrum_Rush seems legit
<Shizuka> 13guess there's that too, enough dirt flying around they could conceivably be covered
<Ghosties> 04Oh, DeathStar, it wouldn't be all that bad
<BroKnee> God watching this kinda reminds me of Katrina ):
<Alchemist> fluttershy! goddamit what have you done?
<Panda> Ghosties: no problem ^^ im only here to help everypony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Open it.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Jo you crazy
<Ponies47> Ghosties: You gonna scare us? :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh well.

<Spriggals> Trees
<GabeMoist> FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Shamroc> DENIED
<Shizuka> 13oh my you're way behind
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> LOL
<Spriggals> It must be fluttershy

<DeathStar> Ghosties: you don't know how huge of a wimp i am
<Spectrum_Rush> DeathStar: aww goosebumps isnt so scary
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: We are.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: i wonda
<Pwah> !!!
<Saturn> 08,01and, yet again, more evidence that AJ is awesome: http://ponyshot.deviantart.com/art/Great-Equestrian-Heroes-251277964
<Shizuka> 13truck crash
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: mind i pm u something
<MadSurge> HAVE A TRUCK TOO
<Spriggals> cow
<MahBoi777> DeathStar: those shows really aren't dat bad
<Ghosties> 04But games would be like Yume Nikki, .flow, Lone Survivor, Scratches, and, if I can really get it going, Silent Hill 2. Amnesia would probably throttle any kind of streaming I could do
<Ponies47> Somthing tells me Saturn likes AJ :)
<Shizuka> 13waaaaaaay behind X3
<Panda> Saturn: find a rarity one fore me. pwease?
<CountDoofus> Stephen Colbert?

<Alchemist> can you do that? can you explode twice?
<hen3ry> technically hit by another car. insurance will cover it
<Om> That truck must weigh more than a building.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is the second baynado.
<MahBoi777> EXPLOSIONS
<Shizuka> 13how did they drive through it though... did the chassis disintegrate?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: lika boss

<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: don't you love how nothing is broken until the twister is IMMEDIATELY on top of it?
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: SSTV is a very distinctive sound from all the examples i heard, much higher pitched
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I like chasing tornadoes.
<sub06905> oh this movie
<Spriggals> I wanna know how much that poor farmer lost because of this.
<RyunosukeKnT> MahBoi777: running from a tornado is futile
<Spectrum_Rush> dem tools and sharp things
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> They can Outrun a horse?
<Om> The wind at that distance would only be. Oh 120mph....
<pony_6458> noooooo applejack is in that thing !!!!!!!!!

<Om> Shizuka: Like a desk fan on high
<RyunosukeKnT> oh bright idea there dumbasses
<Prick> get to the shed!
<hen3ry> safest place in a tornado. Room full of pointy sharp things
<adasdad> too dumb to live...
<oni_link> dat shed
<Shizuka> 13notice it's already spared the house

<Spriggals> This is Fluttershys shed
<RyunosukeKnT> lets take shelter in a wooden barn full of sharp implementes
<Dark_of_Max> lol
<MahBoi777> go see the wizard!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01An F5 would have lifted the house.
<RyunosukeKnT> when a tornado can ram a feence post through an oak tree
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TROLLNADO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or part of it.
<Shamroc> DAT DODGE
<Pwah> outrunning a tornado!
<Shizuka> 13a mile wide F5... spares the house... a couple dozen feet away...
<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: Ah he is a PipSqueak. But that would be kind of mean. So Soarin's Blue and the kitten is white. Oh well. Soarin is a maybe. :P
<RyunosukeKnT> this movie is so full of fail tbh
<Om> Seems Legit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if Shizuka will facehoof before this is over.
<RyunosukeKnT> they'd be ded by now
<CountDoofus> LOCKING THE DOOR? Really??
<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: at these wind speeds, doesn't grass = knives?
<Ponies47> STAY OUTTA ME SHED!
<Iron_Edge> wow thats is a string shed -lol-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pinkies4thWall: Actually, yes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Straw becomes arrows.
<Shizuka> 13remember kids, wind speeds up to / in excess of 300 miles an hour
<RyunosukeKnT> oh god
<Om> I cant help but notice, her hair doesn't move in some shots.
<Shizuka> 13just hang out on the pipe
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: ouch
<xxMoopyxx> Fear me you sick son of a bitch tornado
<Pinkies4thWall> grass=knife. board = missile
<Shizuka> 13strongest plywood shed ever
<Shamroc> Shizuka: wouldnt that kinda rip you in half?
<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: Also, don't you love how nothing is broken until the twister is IMMEDIATELY on top of it?
<MahBoi777> hold on tight
<pony_6458> ahhhhh that must be quite exciting RD approoves
<RyunosukeKnT> if you hand onto a pipe, you are not going to survive you dumb retards
<Om> That would not work.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Don't forget, they changed the scale in the US.
<Phase4> 00,02and heres the scene
<adasdad> fluttershy reinforced the shed with tears and sorrow.
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: Did you ping me?
<Shizuka> 13anyway, this scene is practical, they're hanging on a rotating set
<Alchemist> Wait. the tornado is strong enough to lift houses up and they will survive by strapping themselves to a water pipe with a leather belt?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Shamroc, only a little bit
<Dark_of_Max> its Raping time!
<RyunosukeKnT> they'd be ded
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> RAWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: eeyup
<MahBoi777> HANG ON
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01F5 is taking it's time destroying the shed.
<Pwah> The belt is mightier than the twister!
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: saying?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nom.
<Shamroc> kirzstryfe: riped in half only a little? hmmm
<adasdad> more like ctrl-f5
<Spriggals> Singing paipz
<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: Ah he is a PipSqueak. But that would be kind of mean. So Soarin's Blue and the kitten is white. Oh well. Soarin is a maybe. :P
<xxMoopyxx> FEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR MEEEEEEEEEEE!

<MahBoi777> wheeeeeeeeeeeee
<Pinkies4thWall> Clothes magically stay on
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: we should dub this F5 Fluttershy
<pony_6458> ITS MAGIC
<Shizuka> 13and then the storm system was like AW DAMMIT WHAT ARE THESE SENSORS IN ME, THAT'S IT I'M TAKING MY TORNADOES HOME YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY MORE
<RyunosukeKnT> pwah not to mention all the debis that is magically missing them
<Shamroc> house is like NOPE FUCK YOU
<Shizuka> 13and the storm system instantly disappeared
<RyunosukeKnT> GWAH
<Shizuka> 13all of it
<Prick> this would work but the debris woulda/shoulda killed them
<Om> That, is an F-2...Maybe F-3. Not an F-5
<Shizuka> 13at once
<hen3ry> nevermind at those windspeeds, every piece of gravel, not to mention wood and metal debris, is a lethal bullet
<Iron_Edge> Ponies47: -lol- Soarin sounds good ^-^
<RyunosukeKnT> this movie sucks so hard
<Ponies47> Iron_Edge: IKR :)
<Ponies47> BRB

<Ninjazz> Not sure... if I like this song yet...
<Spectrum_Plush> all the blu
<Ghosties> 04Ain't butthurt, bro. Just incredibly juvenile of ya
<Raibow> its okay
<xxMoopyxx> waow
<Vordox> OneTrickPony: No links in this chat unless permitted, use #Vinyl_Scratch for requests. :P
<CountDoofus> Wow. I can't type and listen to music at the same time. Kudos to you, Phase.
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue what most of this code does

<xxMoopyxx> :|
<OneTrickPony> Vordox: thankyou I wasn't sure
<Kencolt> Phase4: I took a degree in CompSci when I was much younger (I'd be LOST to day) but yeah-- I remember trying to decompile stuff. COBOL was easier...
<xxMoopyxx> :|
<Phase4> 00,02wow, massive classes and all thats wrong is unused imports and missing 'serialVersionUID'
<Vordox> Phase4: You kinda need to join #Vinyl_Scratch too. :P
<BroKnee> Anyone here have D3?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not sure if eclipse or netbeans
<OtakuTom> I'm learning C++ right now.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, its still muted
<Raibow> we need djponi3
<xxMoopyxx> oh by the way would you stop getting mad all the time
<Kencolt> COBOL had that really nice aspect of "Oh, even my moronic superior in Accounting can understand this" because ti was effectively self-documenting.
<OtakuTom> Just got through the first class with an A, so the next step will be Advanced, then the final step will be C++ for Game Development.
<Ghosties> 04Dunno who you're talking to, Moopy
<xxMoopyxx> the guy kicked me
<Vordox> So...why is Vinyl muted?
<Dark_of_Max> i gona sleep im not in a good state bye

<OtakuTom> Good night Dark_of_Max
<xxMoopyxx> waow sorry bro
<Kencolt> But the cards were a pain-- yes, I studied it forst when punchcards were the standard. And we had to submit a stack to the CS office back at the university. BIG stacks at times.
<Ghosties> 04Hey, it's no problem.

<DashWithRainbows> Vordox I'm the newest member of Bronystate's art team. So I guess it would be some sort of promotion XD
<CountDoofus> DashWithRainbows: cool, what's it called? I'll follow ya :$
<Ghosties> 04Eh, it ain't me man. I can't really tell you how to live your life like that since you're not technically doing anything "wrong." If worst came to worst I would suggest staying with you mom ideally but if that doesn't work then try a friend
<Vordox> DashWithRainbows: Oh mai! Hope to see your work performed. =3
<BroKnee> Shamroc Alright well thank you

<DashWithRainbows> Vordox Not that I know of. And even so, I wouldn't want to since I'm a bit... nervous when it comes to others watching me draw.
<cow334> Shamroc: :<
<Vordox> DashWithRainbows: It helped out Wrek big time making other see him while he works.
<Vordox> It may become a motivation instead of deviation
<StupidSexyCJ> DashWithRainbows: you ever paintchat here?
<Shamroc> also BroKnee dont take everything really srsly as well.......i laugh my ass off when my mom gets angry at me sometimes ;p
<DashWithRainbows> StupidSexyCJ Nah. I don't like using paintchat
<DashWithRainbows> it lacks ctrl + z
<Ponies47> Shamroc: moo

<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc, mPoll is a method, taken from a dynamicaly loaded class
<StupidSexyCJ> Ninjazz: Muzzy - Sapphire (grovestyle remix)
<StupidSexyCJ> *groovestyle
<Phase4> 00,02.invoke runs it with 'tab' as the context and null as the parameter list iirc
<Shamroc> Phase4: please dont you'll overload my robotic brain...it has poor memory...

<cow334> BroKnee: double click there name i think
<Phase4> 00,02night Om
<diddutz> what language is this PaintChat written in, Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02Java
<Spectrum_Plush> Ninjazz: MahBoi777 cya
<MahBoi777> gnight Om! sleep well
<BroKnee> :o uhh who is streaming?
<StupidSexyCJ> night Om
<Vordox> <.< LAWL, you sure a Null should be used in Java, Phase4 ?
<Shamroc> oh goodnight Om
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, its valid
<OtakuTom> Ah, no wonder I had a hard time understanding it...I was terrible at Java...lol
<Simon> Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnhjWUepaE8
<CountDoofus> Nighty night, Om
<Phase4> 00,02but you get null refference exceptions if you try to use it
<Vordox> A null is pretty suicide what I have noticed,rather give it a neutral standpoint with a 0 instead of a nothing"
<Vordox> Also Phase4 you need two screens for this. XD
<Phase4> 00,02stupid mouse wont go fast enough
<OtakuTom> Maybe I'll do better at it now since it's been a while from when I did Visual Basic (I kept messing up the syntax between the two)
<diddutz> from nearly everyone i asked i heard Java is nothing but pain in the ass ...
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, LAptop
<Phase4> 00,02diddutz, it is
<Vordox> Phase4: Damn...I tried to do some sort of mix where I can work, and watch/listen at the same time ot the video on a laptop...IMPOSSIBRY
<dalekkahn> Phase4 you can have an extra monitor hooked up to a labtop.
<OtakuTom> Yea, I've gotta see what else my college offers so I can avoid doing Java for my degree.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, its easier on linux
<Vordox> diddutz: It's good for what it is, but it's not prefered
<Phase4> 00,02dalekkahn, but then i cant use my chair
<Phase4> 00,02theres normaly more google while programing (for documentation) but i'm just doing legwork here
<Phase4> 00,02removing warnings

<Phase4> 00,02cow334, not what i expected from halo
<Phase4> 00,02diddutz, it would be
<xxMoopyxx> hey phase 4 play the blow me away by a halo soundtrack

<Evil_Spike> What is server address for me to join?
<Phase4> 00,02this a lot of lag
<HatefulWrath> I've never had any artistic ability my entire life but I just spent the past 2 hours freehand sketching Spike licking Big Macintosh's nutsack and it's actually looking pretty good!
<Rainbow_Crash> i dont play TF2 Ponies47 so would know your pain, just hit it a couple of times :P always does the trick
<Ponies47> HatefulWrath: GTFO :|
<HatefulWrath> like, pony porn is seriously motivating me to become a better artist
<HatefulWrath> I'd like to draw Big Macintosh cumming all over Spike's tummy, and then scan it and vector trace it and make it look as cannon as possible.
<Ponies47> HatefulWrath: We don't tolorate (squee) like that here :|
<HatefulWrath> that would be grrrrreat
<cow334> Well i started downloading team fortress two right
<Ponies47> HatefulWrath: Your grossing us out. Get outta here you perv :|
<cow334> now\
<Ponies47> cow334: YAY :)
<HatefulWrath> Spike and Big Macintosh are my 2 favorite characters. Spike because of his incredible cuteness, and Big Macintosh because of his insanely large black stallion penis.
<MadSurge> Learn to troll better
<HatefulWrath> I want to see it spray cum all over
<Rainbow_Crash> i dont like pony porn, and when somepony says that its just to weird for me lol

<|Discord|> I like the picture
<OtakuTom> Yea, I do like that
<Phase4> 00,02damnit, saturns not here
<OtakuTom> I'm guessing each theater room would have banner themed after that character?
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, it wont make a difference if your browser is any good
<Lighty> 13this unknown, yet beautifull (and emptyheaded) girl pinches my bum at school, and tells me how hot i am

<Shiny_Latias> O.o dude what
<Lighty> 13i know right? she got excpelled for extreme bullying, drugs and sexual harrasment
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, generaly memory usage doesnt effect speed that much
<Phase4> 00,02bigger images shouldnt change it that much
<killerpony7733> Phase4 alright guess i'm more wiser on that then ;)
<NeonRain> So Phase4 . How often you play TF2?
<Phase4> 00,02NeonRain, often enough
<Phase4> 00,02usualy once a night, not allways though
<killerpony7733> Phase4 But it does save you a tiny tiny bit of time by not having the image above instead of the thin banner
<NeonRain> Ah ok I feel bad Phloging the unexperianced.
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, yeah, loads faster
<Phase4> 00,02but its kinda a hack right now

<OtakuTom> Do you have a set price you're looking for with video cards? I'd actually recommend going with something like a GTX 670 if you can find it around $400.
<d3rb> Shimmer: or you get 1 570 now, that should give you good to decent performance, then wait for prices to drop or a new model and get another 570 cheap

<CountDoofus> Alex S. is a good musician, but I hear he's a real jerk when socializing
*NeonRain Flops on Sylandest
<derpy_pony> the login procedure is slow and strange today

<RaveBrony> Hey Jim :$
<NeonRain> Well it's no fun if I am caught! Hi syl. *huged*

*BlueFlare eats the eaten hammer
<Arteza147> Ill see you guys later. I've got to go get half of my foot burned off in surgery
<NeonRain> Well Jim I did play Phase in TF2 today think he was lagging cuse i managed to pholg him with no problem
<OtakuTom> Not bad, Shimmer. The performance difference would be worth the extra cost, IMO, and you won't have to worry about SLI.
*killerpony7733 hugs Sylandest for helping
*Shiny_Latias eats the eaten hammer that was eaten
<Shiny_Latias> o.o

<Arteza147> UGS!
<CountDoofus> Needs more dubtrot.
<Shimmer> Kill the dubstep with fire!
<OtakuTom> I'm trying to gauge interest in trying to set up a Minecraft server (or 2...one Survival and one Creative) for the Bronystate community. Would anybody be interested?
<derpy_pony> blame the zombies
<Ascendant> I should enable utf-8 characters for nicks
<Jim> Maybeh, OtakuTom
<Ascendant> so then I can do /nick ♥
<killerpony7733> |Discord| you don't look good :$
<Shimmer> I would if I played minecraft :p
<derpy_pony> oh...I hit the mute button...explains everything
<BlueFlare> 02you should do that
<BlueFlare> 02derp
<CountDoofus> I don't play Minecraft, but who cares. Go for it, I say :)
<Ascendant> I'm lazy
<Ascendant> + it'll break services
<derpy_pony> what's the stream guy doing? chat code?
<killerpony7733> OtakuTom sure i got minecraft
<Ascendant> Also
<BlueFlare> 02oh
<Ascendant> because you guys probably don't read topics
<MadSurge> I don't like this remix :S
<Jim> derpy_pony: I believe it is code for the Paintchat on the webpage
<Ascendant> Nicks no longer expire
<derpy_pony> oh...never been there
<Ascendant> If you want a nick you'll have to ask someone who has the power to drop nicks
<OtakuTom> Yes, it's for Paintchat
<Shiny_Latias> Am I the only one that actually reads topics?
<Ascendant> all halfops and above have that power
<derpy_pony> I heard bears and wolves live there
<Ascendant> not sure if they know how to do it but that's fine too
<Jim> And owls
<MadSurge> derpy_pony: that's why Phase4 wants to renovate it, to see if people start using it again :D
<User0> He's not the only one writing code right now (I'm at work, and not being very efficient...)
<BlueFlare> 02I read them :&

<killerpony7733> Vordox that you may have but you will only reignite a pointless argument :D
<Sylandest> or is he saying "bring back the bass"?
<Vordox> "Pft, Computers is better hardware." "Atleast we console users buy finished hardwares instead of faulty ones each year."

<Vordox> Just had that thoght, how often do we upgrade PC compared to Consoles? If there's a faulty hardware in Console, they get refund, but if it's pC you have to buy better stuff :P
<OtakuTom> 4 letters...RROD
*Viri eeks and falls again

*Viri cuddles :3

<Vordox> Of course, we have the Handheld COnsoles but they are a unique series.
<derpy_pony> either you use mouse and keyboard, or you use one of these control pads for the motorically challenged
<Vordox> Still saying the same thing how often do we need to upgrade things on Consoles? :P
<Shiny_Latias> o3o
<d3rb> depends, if apple ever makes one, every year :D
<OtakuTom> ^
<Vordox> My PS3 is working awesome, My whole PS library works, My NES still works after 20+ years soon
<killerpony7733> derpy_pony pc mouse and keyboard users also have a higher typing speed and what not

<OtakuTom> My first-run Xbox 360 ran for 4 years before it got the RROD, so I didn't have warranty on that one, so I had to buy a brand new system.
<Derpy_Ctrax> Vordox you sure its the right person?
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Aaand how many of these people join competative gaming scenes? Oh right there's hardly any :P
<d3rb> fun fact, original xbox 1 controlers can crush a child

<cowvarkian> guess not
<Jim> so many bad dubs out there
<RustyMeat> SuperBrony64 should stream something
<cowvarkian> orly TheHoodyNinja
<RustyMeat> just saying
<SuperBrony64> 11,12I should possibly stream something...
<cowvarkian> sounds good
<cowvarkian> or something
<Arentius> Hai all
<cowvarkian> im one of those
<cowvarkian> and hi Arentius
<Jim> hai Arentius
<Arentius> how we all doin
<cowvarkian> being bored maybe
<cowvarkian> ergo, nothing
<TheHoodyNinja> im stuck between staying here and being random or playing a game, which should i do?
<Arentius> lamenes
<cowvarkian> which game, TheHoodyNinja
<Arentius> you should randomly play a game while staying here
<TheHoodyNinja> cowvarkian: the ultimate nerd game
<cowvarkian> which one
<TheHoodyNinja> DnD
<cowvarkian> ah, I wanna play
<Arentius> I miss DnD :<
<TheHoodyNinja> the OG of RP
<cowvarkian> hmm
<cowvarkian> im assuming you mean pen and paper DnD, not the computer game >.>
<cowvarkian> but, the fuck do I know anyways
<TheHoodyNinja> cowvarkian: the og part yes, but i have computer version to play
<Arentius> nothing like going bard then evolving it into an assassin..those were the days
<cowvarkian> I meant the one you were playing, yes TheHoodyNinja
<TheHoodyNinja> Never played paper dnd, but i have played many computer versions
<cowvarkian> indeed Arentius
<Arentius> My DM always hated me though...I was one of those people that constantly broke the game without breaking the rules
<Jim> did you use blue dye?
<cowvarkian> I played ADnD 2nd edition with my dad a few years ago... but I never played it since, and I cant really find anyone else to play it with >.>
<cowvarkian> *my dad and some other people
<Arentius> I um...might have found a way to instantly kill anything ever
<cowvarkian> heh
<Arentius> can't remember the name of the spell now
<Arentius> but it reduced anything you touched to 3hp
<cowvarkian> is it "the spell of fucking douchebaggery"?
<Arentius> imbue it into a dagger which did 1d4 + 4 damage with str modifiere
<cowvarkian> or something else
<Arentius> modifier*
<Arentius> ...1d4 + 4 9/10 would put anything into the "i'm bleeding to death" state
<cowvarkian> seems legit
<Arentius> it actually was...my Dm hated me for it...so much so that he caused my dagger to be stolen..then the spell was mystically forgotten by everyone everywher.e...at the same time
<cowvarkian> hmm
<cowvarkian> seems... fucking silly
<Nick> wb
<Arentius> ah DnD 3.5 was horrendously easy to break
<TheHoodyNinja> just make a sorc and blow shit up
<Arentius> it was fun finding new ways to annoy my DM

<alexxm> i'm good Petrified_Discord got a trial shift at a cafe i gave my cv to
<Petrified_Discord> Alchemist: The Ministry of Education sounds like wizards. Are they wizards? :O

<Petrified_Discord> Alchemist: Woot!
<Petrified_Discord> alexxm: Woot!
<Petrified_Discord> dammit tab... :/
<Shimmer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsJuNQTZhQk
<Alchemist> Petrified_Discord: well the ways they operate is cetainly magical :D
<SomeRandomPony> Hi.
<Lil_B> Alchemist how do they "Void" one of your classes? Do they just say "Nope, you haven't done this class!" And Why the 500$ ?
<Shimmer> Hiya SomeRandomPony
<Elondras> Hey SomeRandomPony
<Petrified_Discord> ohai SomeRandomPony
<WindWhistler> Great, now I'm bored.
<Lil_B> hi SomeRandomPony
<alexxm> hey SomeRandomPony hows your day been
<SomeRandomPony> Shitty, and yours?
<WindWhistler> I wanna draw, but at the same time I don't want to...
<WindWhistler> What's a girl to do?
<Shimmer> 1st world problems?
<Petrified_Discord> WindWhistler: Half-draw, half-don't-draw
<WindWhistler> Petrified_Discord: :|
<SomeRandomPony> Draw Schrödinger's Pony
<Petrified_Discord> dat ö
<Shimmer> You can watch me shuffle the chat
<Alchemist> Lil_B: they said that I didnt complete a prerequisite of a certain class, so I couldnt have completed it officially. Thats why they say they void my grade. the 500$ fine is because I actually attended the class and took an exam and the amount supposed to cover the exam and training fees of the professor.
