<FF|Sleep> Ah.
<FF|Sleep> But someone should probably do that who has the POWAH
<Coconutswallow> Twilight: And here we are, girls! At Canterlot! Pinkie: It's only a model. *collective shh*

<Efreet> I lol'd at your quote, Coconutswallow.
<Efreet> srs.
<Efreet> I could imagine Pinkie Pie saying that to Twilight.
<Coconutswallow> It's the first thing that came to my head when I thought about that scene.
<Coconutswallow> It doesn't help that that I envision a fake looking plastic playset in the background...
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf4QImoZdlk
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about WKUK- Hippo In the City
<Efreet> xD
<Efreet> I imagine.. Spike as the black knight now that I think about it.
<Efreet> xD
<Spin> lol just got to the french castle part
<Efreet> The black knight always triumphs!

<Tobi> Sigh, Blood Magic is so tiresome after you use it twice in a row...
<Nittany_Tiger> Many, many years.
<Tobi> You get all woozy and you just want to sleep...
<BitZero> Peculiar.
<Parchment_Scroll> What is this... nore-mall you speak of? Is there good shopping there?

<pinkiepieisdabawss> hello, all
<Whompman9000> With some work I had to finish
<Tobi> I mean, I went to a universe where it was all underwater and everything down there were mostly fish....
<Nittany_Tiger> Irene finally seems to have a stable eye.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's been having trouble obtaining a stable eye for days.
<Tobi> I'm going to go now, You guys seem on edge....
<BlackGlow> Wait what?
<Nittany_Tiger> This will be the East Coast's first hurricane in years.
<Dermathil> >yfw thousands of new-yorkers will see those natural disasters as the telltale signs of 2012
<PrincessMolestia> 14...
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<BiggusDickus> apaarently we're on edgee
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgvRfmo8Ock
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Community - The DJ Steve Porter Remix!
<Nittany_Tiger> On top of the 5.9 that happened Tuesday.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Why couldnt it come when I lived in NY? Grrr.
<PrincessMolestia> 14I love storms.
<Nittany_Tiger> So do I.
<Nittany_Tiger> I would love to be with Irene.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or in Irene.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'd take shelter in a concrete hotel.
<PrincessMolestia> 14@hurricanemeter Nittany_Tiger
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Nittany_Tiger is 32% hurricane. (1529)
<PrincessMolestia> 14Needs moar hurricane :P
<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<Ionnan> you guys are on edge. I'm a little bit wierded out. but it's cool. everyone's got their own taste.
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't had hurricane since 1989.
<Whompman9000> What happened...?
<PrincessMolestia> 14I love that. I love you Steven_Magnet
<BiggusDickus> well i've been watching Holy Grail and eating oreos so I don't know
<PrincessMolestia> 14I dont think I've ever witnessed a hurricane before
<Kalliope> ...wrong movie.
<Ionnan> ooo I love that movie!
<Ionnan> and oreos!
<PrincessMolestia> 14Really bad storms, but dont think they were classified as hurricanes. Not sure,
<Nittany_Tiger> What I witnessed was a dying hurricane, but it didn't die as fast as predicted.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Upstate NY isnt really known for them as far as I know. :P
<PrincessMolestia> 14Ahh
<BiggusDickus> wrong movie?
<Nittany_Tiger> So it was either a minimal hurricane or a top-end tropical storm when it hit here.
<Nittany_Tiger> It was Hugo.
<BiggusDickus> oh forgot to change my nick
*Whompman9000 opens the Gates of Steel
<Whompman9000> The things I do best
<Nittany_Tiger> Hurricanes are really long windstorms.
<Spin> I touch myself
<Nittany_Tiger> It's like a windy thunderstorm that last for hours.
<Spin> well then
<HotCocoa> Huh
<Nittany_Tiger> That's what I remember from Hugo.
<HotCocoa> Looks like a server went down
<HotCocoa> inb4 netsplit
<Nittany_Tiger> Except I haven't experienced winds that powerful ever since.
<Nittany_Tiger> Where it would rock a car.
<AlphaOmega> All you eastern US states people all ready for irene?
<Spin> BRING IT ON!!
<Whompman9000> Yeah
<Ali1017> I see no netsplit
<HotCocoa> Guess there's no netsplit then
<AlphaOmega> OK you ponys have to keep in contact somehow so the rest of us ponys know you are ok
<PrincessMolestia> 14Sounds kinda scarey but exciting.
<Ali1017> The quit message would've said the server.
<Whompman9000> It won't be bad for me...
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah. Solidified my love of weather and got me interested in severe weather.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wanted to be in another hurricane after that.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or a tornado.
<Octavia> ibilis redirected me, and it seems to have went boom
<Octavia> i was on rubicon
<Nittany_Tiger> I remember when storm chasing was still getting started. I wanted to do that.
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved it when I found out others loved severe weather and went after it.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Yeah, I want to storm chase kinda too.
<Nittany_Tiger> I've done it three times.
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, 4.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Nice.
<PrincessMolestia> 14None for me. lol
<Nittany_Tiger> 3 in KS, OK, and TX. Once in MN.
<Plorf> So who hasn't seen this?
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Portal: No Escape
<Nittany_Tiger> Last year, I rode with experienced chasers. Helped a lot.
<PrincessMolestia> 14I've not seen anything much where I'm living in TX yet. Some strong downpours acouple times, but nothing as big as some of the ones I saw in NY
<Whompman9000> I sure haven't
<Nittany_Tiger> TX is in a drought.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Yeah, friend told me about that.
<Plorf> It's really good.
<PrincessMolestia> 14I'm in the greener part, way way on the east side, almost in LA
<Nittany_Tiger> Ahh.
<Whompman9000> You know...
<Nittany_Tiger> So not in the super-dry West TX.
<Whompman9000> What would everyone here like to do most?
<PrincessMolestia> 14I did live there for a little. Sucked big time.
<Nittany_Tiger> I've been as far south as right along the Red River valley.
<Nittany_Tiger> And as far west as Amarillo, TX.
<Plorf> uh
<PrincessMolestia> 14Furthest west I've been is Cali. lol
<Nittany_Tiger> I really liked exploring the plains during my first plains chase.
<Plorf> that question is far too ambiguous
<PrincessMolestia> 14Driven through the plains. Was nice. Though a little boring. :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I have no desire to live in Cali or anything west of the Rockies.
<Whompman9000> You're right...
<Nittany_Tiger> I loved the plains when I first saw them.
<PrincessMolestia> 14I would live in some parts of Cali
*Whompman9000 punches the wall
*BlackGlow will BRB as he's hungry
<Whompman9000> Somehow this wall holds up
<PrincessMolestia> 14Speaking of the Rockies, I also lived at about 9000ft in CO lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Living in forested mountains for all my life made the plains look awesomely-fresh.
<Nittany_Tiger> You've been all over.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Mhmmm
<Nittany_Tiger> I've only lived in SC and PA.
<Nittany_Tiger> I plan on moving out to the plains.
<Nittany_Tiger> Either OK or MN.
<PrincessMolestia> 14I've lived in Germany, NY, TX, NC, GA, CO, NE
<Ionnan> I would like to draw an awesome animated fan tribute to past sins... But man... I've never made a cartoon as long or as good as this one would have to be.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Think thats all. lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Wow.
<Parchment_Scroll> Must be the fourth wall. Quick! Summon Pinkie Pie!
<Whompman9000> Well I tell you I would go back in time and go to watch this show:

<Nittany_Tiger> I might want to drive around PA some more before I leave.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Oh yeah, forgot Arkansas too, lamo
<PrincessMolestia> 14PA is decent
<Nittany_Tiger> I visited Centralia, PA during my first year of stay.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll be surprised if that town still exists anymore.
<Nittany_Tiger> It has a population less than this channel's member count right now.
<PrincessMolestia> 14No idea where that is. I'd mainly been to Philly and Pitsburgh
<PrincessMolestia> 14:P
<PrincessMolestia> 14Yay small towns!
<Nittany_Tiger> It's a nearly-dead town. Used to be big until they accidentally started a mine fire that's still burning today.
<PrincessMolestia> 14That sounds familiar.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Heard about that somewhere of some town. Might have been that one.
<Nittany_Tiger> Might have seen it in a movie with Chevy Chase and Dan Akroyd.
<Nittany_Tiger> Even though that town was fake.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Well, I remember seeing it on some news somewhere a while back.
<Nittany_Tiger> But it was based on Centralia.
<Nittany_Tiger> So was the town in Silent Hill.
<Nittany_Tiger> At least the premise.
<Shaico> !seen Donitz
<DerpyBot> Shaico: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. Donitz is in the channel.
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know if Centralia would make the news nowadays unless it finally loses it's borough status.
<Whompman9000> I guess I killed the chat....
<Coconutswallow> QUIT I've recieved a new mission assignment.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Dunno.
<AlphaOmega> mmmmmm coffeee
<Nittany_Tiger> At that point, the PA govt. will take it over and mine the coal out.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Just remember hearing about a town with that in the news a while back.
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know of any other towns with long-lasting mine fires.
<Nittany_Tiger> Of course, I didn't know about Centralia for a long time.
<PrincessMolestia> 14The name sounds familiar though, so it may have been that.
<AlphaOmega> mmmmm coffee and chocolate
*Whompman9000 leaves due to killing the chat...
<AlphaOmega> Wow, Askpinkamina is rough this update
<Firebolt> Yup.
<Firebolt> I loved it.

<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about yes twilight_sparkle season_2
<Xiagu|alseep> this is the third version and the lack of anti-aliasing on the YES! still kills me
<Retsamoreh> So
<Retsamoreh> I just talked my friend into covering his stepdad's car in pony stickers
<Xiagu|alseep> :S
<ValtheJean> well howdy gents
<^Stargazer> yes, that's a pretty lazy job lol
<Retsamoreh> Because his stepdad is attempting to find a therapist to "cure" his Brony-ism.
<Xiagu|alseep> oookay, well, that's bad, but so is covering a car in stickers
<^Stargazer> never realised how yellow that picture is
<ValtheJean> ah, everyone is afk. I'm assuming that everyone has parted ways :P
<ValtheJean> oh well, I'll be back tomorrow :P
<Parchment_Scroll> Okay, that's... No therapist worth their diploma would touch that.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm here. Just occupied.
<Xiagu|alseep> covering a car in stickers is not the way of love and tolerance :P
<Parchment_Scroll> @Xiagu: Gotta agree with that, tho.
<^Stargazer> lol
<Pyroh> I feel like eating a begal
<Pyroh> BUT WE HAVE TO CREAM CHEESE
<Xiagu|alseep> Pyroh, *bagel *no
<Pyroh> no*

<Retsamoreh> Okay, so, actually he declined that.
<Xiagu|alseep> Good for him

<^Stargazer> most people wouldn't care about middle names that much
<Xiagu> yeah middle names are fine
<^Stargazer> I've used mine like, 5 times total in my life time
<Xiagu> when was the last time you had to write more than your middle initial?
<Parchment_Scroll> :D I accidentally changed my middle name once.
<^Stargazer> elemetry school lol

<HaysforPonies> High School
<^BlacklightShining> lol at Derpy the alicorn
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Skyfall (Update Part 6!) (http://tinyurl.com/3v347w9)
<Retsamoreh> I want to change my middle name to "Awesome"
<Retsamoreh> So I can legitly say "Yea, awesome's my middle name!"
<Efreet> I want to change my name to Danger.
<^Stargazer> I'd like to erase my middle name and just have first and last lol
<Parchment_Scroll> @Retsamoreh: Technically all you have to do is just go to the Soc. Security office.
<Parchment_Scroll> "No, Danger's my MIDDLE name."</Austinpowers>
<Retsamoreh> Or maybe I should change it to "adventure".
<^Stargazer> hum... what to do now... read more Hoenshy before I go to bed... or something else
<Shaico> You guys are helping me procrastinate.
<Parchment_Scroll> How is Hoenshy?
<Shaico> Does that make you feel good?
<Parchment_Scroll> I haven't touched it yet.
<Xiagu> Retsamoreh, Efreet, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_change#United_States
<^Stargazer> I'm enjoying it so far
<Shaico> And never read Hoenshy before.
<^Stargazer> I'm on Chapter 4 atm
<Efreet> I'm Australian. All I need to do is go on an epic quest and vanquish 20 Trapdoor spiders.
<Retsamoreh> I'm not stupid enough to actually change my name though.
<Retsamoreh> I mean, in the US, changing your name is a pretty sucky process.
<^Stargazer> makes me wonder what would happen if they ran into a ponyta/rapidash or that new zebra pokemon though lol
<Octavia|Music> it took me 80$ and 30 minutes
<^Stargazer> ?
<^BlacklightShining> I know, right?
<Efreet> http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/08/fallout-new-vegas-lonesome-road-hits-sept-20/
<^BlacklightShining> I want to change my name
<Efreet> First comment = Lol'd
<^BlacklightShining> I was told it's $350
<Parchment_Scroll> It took me $10 and about the same amount of time, but it wasn't a deliberate name change. :P
<HaysforPonies> If I ever really feel for it, I may change my first name to my middle name. I like it better.
<Retsamoreh> Octavia, why'd you change your name?
<Octavia|Music> depends on the state you were born in, etc..
<Octavia|Music> because i did not like my middle name
<Retsamoreh> Eh.
<Retsamoreh> Anyways. I probably won't change my middle name in the end.
<^BlacklightShining> I recently got a new ID
<Octavia|Music> i kept my last name, changes first and middle
<^BlacklightShining> they put my first, middle, and the first half of my last name in the First Name field
<^BlacklightShining> and the second half of my last name in the Last Name field
<Retsamoreh> Stupid family tradition dictates the father has to use his first name as his firstborn son's middle name.
<HaysforPonies> Hahaha.
<HaysforPonies> My mom once accidently crammed my whole name into my last name in an airplane ticket.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I quite like my name.
<Retsamoreh> And I'm the only male left that has the family name, so I can't change my last name at risk of ending the entire family name.
<HaysforPonies> Didn't know until security told me it didn't match.
<Retsamoreh> So I literally am stuck.
<^BlacklightShining> stupid sexist traditions
<MrMooMoo> I like my name as well.
<Retsamoreh> Hows'it sexist?
<^BlacklightShining> …wait, I'm still ^BlacklightShining?!
<Tenaris> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mCojSVaji4
<HaysforPonies> I'm good with my first name. I just like my middle better and would like to be called by that.
<Efreet> so who wants to take a guess at my initials.
<Retsamoreh> I mean, it's not really that sexist.
<BlacklightShining> [21:37] Retsamoreh: And I'm the only male left that has the family name, so I can't change my last name at risk of ending the entire family name.
<BlacklightShining> >implying that your family follows the husband's-last-name-overwrites-wife's-last-name tradition
<Efreet> I'll start you off.
<Efreet> TxP
<BlacklightShining> o rly?
<Parchment_Scroll> FRT?
<BlacklightShining> how is that not sexist?
<mib_imq58m> Is this the place that they're showing Lord of the Rings/Ponies?
<Efreet> .. :C
<MrMooMoo> EF
<Efreet> TxP = One letter off.
<Dashite> Yes
<Retsamoreh> It'll depend on my wife, I suppose.
<Parchment_Scroll> S&M? Wait, no, M is three off.
<Efreet> you get 25 guesses!(inb4nooneguesses)
<Tenaris> i love how my little pony ad's are poping up on daily site xD;
<Retsamoreh> If I love her and she wants us to use her last name, I'll let her.
<MrMooMoo> TQ
<Octavia|Music> if i get married, my last name gets hyphenated
<Efreet> hnnngh >:I
<BlacklightShining> Tenaris: on Equestria Daily?
<Efreet> My name is TJP.
<Efreet> Well, Initials.
<mib_imq58m> My bad. I just realized that it's Friday morning right now, not Friday evening. Sorry about that.
<BlacklightShining> if I get married, I'm taking my wife's last name
<Tenaris> BlacklightShining: eyup
<SilverMane> we will be watching that in 18 hours. hope to see you there
<HaysforPonies> Octavia: One of my cross country friends had that happen to his last name.
<BlacklightShining> because the second half sucks and the first half is borrowed from a bunch of generations ago
<Octavia|Music> yeah, my girlfriend is mexican and thats how they do it
<Tenaris> its atcually funny
*BlacklightShining 's last name = meh
<HaysforPonies> He got made fun of for it cause it was quite long.
<mib_imq58m> Thanks
<MrMooMoo> Mines AS, i need a middle name starting with S
<Efreet> Twin Quarry = First and Last name's meaning.
*BlacklightShining goes to Equestria Daily and looks for MLP ads
<Efreet> Twin James Quarry
<Efreet> oh joy
<Retsamoreh> My mom used my dad's last name because hers was German, and at the time there was a lot of animosity towards the Germans, at least where they lived.
<MrMooMoo> Make me a middle name.
<HaysforPonies> James Quarry sounds like a rough draft name for an "over the edge cop" movie.
<Efreet> .. Lol.
<Tenaris> BlacklightShining: odds are it wont appear all the time
<User_8567> What's this about Twin James Quarry?
<Efreet> My full name's Thomas James Perry.
<Efreet> Twin James Quarry
<User_8567> Oh
<BlacklightShining> Tenaris: yeah, 'cause I'm not seeing any ads
<BlacklightShining> not one
<Efreet> I dunno what James means.
*MrMooMoo google searches you
<Parchment_Scroll> Twilight James Sparkle?
<Efreet> oh god
<User_8567> That's a pretty kickin name, ny firery friend
<Efreet> Twin James Quarry or Thomas James Perry? xD
<Tenaris> BlacklightShining: im to lazy to screen cap just refres till you see it
<Parchment_Scroll> I'd give you my full name, but it's HIGHLY uncommon. :P
<BlacklightShining> reload *
<User_8567> Pick one. One sounds like an action hero the other the CEO of a major computer company
<BlacklightShining> kz
<Efreet> I know like.. 10 people with the middlename "James"

<MrMooMoo> Eeyup
<User_8567> Thinkabout it
<^Stargazer> now I realise what I'm missing, I need some music playing heh
*HaysforPonies Ain't giving his real name. He would likely be confused with the crazy guy on Facebook that shares it.
<Efreet> I don't really care about giving out my name.
<Nickel_Scream> Who is twiglight sparkles favorite author? Stephanie Mare.
<Nickel_Scream> *twilight
<Efreet> I've had it butchered in real life.
<Efreet> :C
<^Stargazer> ha ha
<User_8567> Thomas is a respesctible name, perhaps a tad geeky (in the good sense). James adds body and volume to the first, giving it back bone. And the last sounds just outta left fieldenough to ganer attention
<User_8567> garner
<Parchment_Scroll> @Nickel_Scream: You are a horrible pony for that joke.
<Nickel_Scream> I'm pretty pleased with myself for it.
<Nickel_Scream> I thought about it in the car tonight.

<^Stargazer> and robing everyone either lol
<^Stargazer> I'm kind of nervous to venture out, those scorpians and other animals really tear me to pieces lol
<Discord> You can... play a Fallout game without robbing and killing everyone? You're mad, mad I say!
<Efreet_Eidolon> Pacifist playthroughs.
<Efreet_Eidolon> They never go well for me.
<Efreet_Eidolon> I end up raging at Caeser and shooting his head off.
<User_8567> As it shouldbe

<Parchment_Scroll> My IRL name is Padraic. Should be pronounced "PA-drig" but I pronounce it "Patrick" which it actually is... It's a gaelic spelling. (Note I say "/A/" gaelic spelling.)
<MrMooMoo> No this is Patrick.
<Efreet_Eidolon> My name may be Thomas, but I spell it Thom.
<User_8567> Gaelic eh? Good tounge

<MrMooMoo> Blood?!?
<Efreet_Eidolon> It was strawberry Jam.
<Parchment_Scroll> What blood? (Goes back to picture)
<User_8567> In Our grand and glruois leader's words:
<User_8567> "Gotcha!"
<User_8567> :)
<GumballCrash> just read the fanfic recently posted, "Painless"
<Parchment_Scroll> Okay, not bad.
<GumballCrash> and I am fighting back MANLY TEARS
<Efreet_Eidolon> Someone should write up a happyfic about Pinkie Pie.
<Efreet_Eidolon> She keeps getting sad stories :(
<User_8567> Are you a writefriend?
<Efreet_Eidolon> nope :C
<User_8567> Awww
<GumballCrash> I might end up being one haha
<Efreet_Eidolon> Can't write to save my life.
<User_8567> Well......
<User_8567> I sure if your life DEPENDED on it....
<ForeverOdin> I have an idea for a fanfic, but my writing skills are mediocre at best ha
<User_8567> Then what kinda friend are you?
<Efreet_Eidolon> >tried to write a light hearted grimdark story, can't continue. D:
<GumballCrash> I have like seven ideas that are all merging into one
<User_8567> A what?
<User_8567> Ouch
<Efreet_Eidolon> Basically, it seems grimdark from the beginning.. then suddenly.. WHAT A TWIST!
<User_8567> That sounds like a trainwreck.....unless that's the idea, not the wreck, the merging that is
*HaysforPonies has ideas that come into his head for fanfics that wither up and die when about to be typed.
<MrMooMoo> Does it involve sweater dresses.
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Drawfriend Stuff #165 (http://tinyurl.com/3uswnrk)
<GumballCrash> haha well it's mostly bits and pieces forming around a central theme of trials, tribulations, and accomplishment
<User_8567> Who?
<^Stargazer> yay =D
<User_8567> DRAW FRIND!!!!
<HaysforPonies> Haha, since when was Cog #1?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hahaha @ my quote
<Xiagu|alseep> 165 again?
<MrMooMoo> Hella late..
<Sketchy_Sounds> "The 60s Batman film is basically the show but turned up to eleven."
<HaysforPonies> I wrote 1192 lines?!
<GumballCrash> i approve of today's drawfriend shippings
<^Stargazer> yeah, I dunno how I got up to 2100 lines
<^Stargazer> sure doesn't feel like I talk that much
<^Stargazer> =O
<^Stargazer> 16 makes me sad, I wanna hug Zecora now
<GumballCrash> if you stick around long enough...
<Retsamoreh> Anyone ever watch the brilliant move "The Game"?
<Untamed> fffFFFFFFUUUUUUUU~
<Retsamoreh> No, it's a real movie.
<Retsamoreh> And it's freakin brilliant.
*Parchment_Scroll was drugged and left for dead in Mexico, and all he got was this lousy T-Shirt.
<Parchment_Scroll> I love that movie.
<^Stargazer> 25 makes me laugh lol
<Retsamoreh> Indeed.
<User_8567> number 5 is so cute. Not a fan of the shipping, but so cute anyway
<^Stargazer> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uy4wsjoB4rQ/TlcjoxwodXI/AAAAAAAALBQ/XFMX56cW_yg/s1600/Snails+is+a+man.png
<^Stargazer> Snails is a real colt lol
<Untamed> Anyone play the awesome game "Thug Aim"?
<Untamed> Its so awesome, it makes me want to say it 10 times as fast as I can
<^Stargazer> 5 doesn't look like shipping too much
<^Stargazer> more like playful between pinkie and rainbow, but that's just my opinion
<HaysforPonies> 25 I can imagine being a daydream scene in Season 2.
<User_8567> He will cut you
<User_8567> With that knife
<User_8567> and it will hurt
<^Stargazer> I like 7 and 12 alot
<^Stargazer> 12 is really nice, scenery that looks really well done
<MrMooMoo> NyanCatxRainbowDash
*Retsamoreh two alots with numbers 7 and 12 give Stargazer a hug
<^Stargazer> I wanna hug dat Zecora, she looks like she needs one =3
<HaysforPonies> I'm liking 12 and 13 but for some reason I looked again and the shadow of Oct's chin makes it look like a muppet mouth. Now I can't unsee it.
<User_8567> So, what's the deal with 22?
<^Stargazer> 13 is a cool Octavia pic too
<Parchment_Scroll> 23 is hilarious.
<MrMooMoo> Not enough sweater dresses..
<User_8567> I always approve of Octivia, unless there's shipping involed
<^Stargazer> 22 was a request
<^Stargazer> "Celestia's battle for the sixth Element of Harmony the first time Nightmare Moon rose up. I'm not sure I agree entirely with the story, but I couldn't resist the challenge."
<HaysforPonies> We all cave to some shipping eventually.

<Efreet_Eidolon> wut's happening to her
<Efreet_Eidolon> D:
<^Stargazer> every luna picture just makes me want Season 2 more lol
<User_8567> but it escapes me....
<HaysforPonies> I swear, that is some reference to a thing.
<User_8567> What is her expression?
<User_8567> What is Luna thinking?
<HaysforPonies> I can't tell if she is being turned to stone or using magic
<^Stargazer> 2... is kind of scary lol
<^Stargazer> Rarity looks like she's turning to diamond
<MrMooMoo> I knew her destiny was a rock.
<Nickel_Scream> Shes like Zelgadis from Slayers.
<Plorf> i actually didn't realize that was rarity for somreason
<Nickel_Scream> She's now a golem and her gemskin grants her super armor to attacks.
<User_8567> he he he. Clearly it should be "Pony of Persia"
<User_8567> SUPER ARMMOR
<User_8567> RRRRRRRGGGGGG
<HaysforPonies> Can't think of Prince of Persia anymore without Nolan North.
<User_8567> And then there's good ol' Derpy doin it right again!
<HaysforPonies> Nolan North pony, make it happen.

*DerpyBot covers her ears with her hooves to block out User_8567's shouting
<Leonon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXt1AylGdFc
<Parchment_Scroll> Whoa, haven't seen that in a while.
<MrMooMoo> At least I have chicken.
<Shaico> Hey guys. My friend wants to chat with you guys.
<AlphaOmega> Are you pondering that what was luna inside NMM manipulated things in some form so that NMM would cause the mane six to go though the required trials to form the friendship, so that Luna can be freed from NMM?
<MrMooMoo> FRIEND
<Shaico> She is wondering what bronies are like.
<Efreet_Eidolon> Yeah, essentially, AlphaOmega
<Efreet_Eidolon> Bronies are cool.
<Retsamoreh> Say, Shaico... Do you like bananas?
<Efreet_Eidolon> And random.
<Efreet_Eidolon> and ponies.
<Octavia|Music> Shaico, just show her #sp :)
<Leonon> we're crazy and saturated in memes
<Shaico> haiii
<Parchment_Scroll> Memetically Delicious!
<User_8567> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CCPjVBxYGI&feature=related
<MrMooMoo> Hey hey hey
<Shaico> what so good about mylittle poniess??
<User_8567> Vid appiclible to effet's words
<MrMooMoo> Everything
<User_8567> Oh my
<Octavia|Music> friendship, and magic
<User_8567> What a question to ask
<Efreet_Eidolon> Ponies is good about my little ponies.
<MrMooMoo> Laren Faust
<Parchment_Scroll> @Shaico's friend: Well, have you watched it?
<Leonon> it has a diverse cast whose personalities play off each other in interresting ways
<Coz> Ninja ponies or Pirate ponies?
<Retsamoreh> My little ponies has the most friendshippal magic anyone will ever see.
<HaysforPonies> Lauren Faust, the fact it isn't "omg the conflict is that I need to get blue nail polish for the party"
<MrMooMoo> Charactorization
<Parchment_Scroll> The jokes are actually funny no matter your age group.
<MrMooMoo> CUTENESS
<Efreet_Eidolon> Pinkie Pie.
<Parchment_Scroll> Yeah, cuteness factors into it.
<HaysforPonies> Incredibly great voice acting.
<MrMooMoo> The fandom is awesome (most of it)
<User_8567> The show's first director actually had a vison, and she did all in her power to acomplish it
<Octavia|Music> i like ninja ponies, they can sneak up
<Parchment_Scroll> Snark. There's a lot of snarkiness in the characters.
<User_8567> Did she succed?
<MrMooMoo> Twilights purple.
<HaysforPonies> Fluttershy can make any man's spirit crumble into a mass of diabetes.
<User_8567> I think it is safe to say that most of us here wouldsay yes
<Parchment_Scroll> We can claim that Twilight Sparkle is less gay than Twilight sparkles. :P
<Coz> Come on what's better Ninja ponies or Pirate ponies?
<HaysforPonies> The songs are great.
<User_8567> But intelligent reaons aside
<Shaico> oh really?
<Efreet_Eidolon> Neither, Coz.
<User_8567> the show makes me laugh something good
<Efreet_Eidolon> Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot Ponies are better.
<Octavia|Music> Twilight Thparkleth is definitely the gayest.
<MrMooMoo> Ponies>4chan
<User_8567> "Spike! There are no Zombie Ponies!"
<Xiagu|alseep> Twilight Snarkle > all ponies
<^Stargazer> teenage mutant ninja ponies
<User_8567> AND HOW

<Kadreal> the Equestria tales game
<Jenemmy> Hello, Bronies
<MrMooMoo> No Im confused
<Parchment_Scroll> @Shaico: Is there a keyboard fight going on there?
<User_8567> Heh, when you ask the fan base why theyare fans, you're gonna get fan responses
<Kadreal> I asked the guy, he says he's not awesomedreamcoder....
<HaysforPonies> Keyboard fight. Bang bang mash mash.
<Kadreal> bad cereal bad!
<Jenemmy> Just getting exited for S2 -squeal-
<Jenemmy> *excited
<MrMooMoo> Finger finger
<Razyn> 0Way~
<Razyn> 0Yay~
<Jenemmy> I know
<User_8567> Just like how if you ask haters why they hate, they gonna give you hate answers
<Jenemmy> I can hardly wait
<HaysforPonies> Slap slap
<Jenemmy> I wonder what this "Discord" character will look like
<BlackGlow> O_o
<User_8567> What did cereal do this time?
<Jenemmy> And what his VA will be
<MrMooMoo> Clop clop
<Razyn> 0I dun-
<Spin> Alright I'm back what I miss?
<Razyn> 0Wait.
<User_8567> What is even goingon anymore?!?
<HaysforPonies> Woaaah there.
<Razyn> 0Crispin Freeman,
<HaysforPonies> I was imitating a keyboard fight.
<Razyn> 0That would be fucking epic
<User_8567> Oh my
<User_8567> sounds
<Tenaris> Randomness, how addicting will mlp fim be in 5 years from now?
<User_8567> humm
<Jenemmy> I apologize, never heard him
<Spin> Cocaine
<MrMooMoo> And Imitated the end of the fight
<Jenemmy> Looking him up now, and I see only thumbs up
<Octavia|Music> i still enjoy things from 20 years ago
<User_8567> How addictive!
<Tenaris> and how many page views will the daily have by then xD;
<HaysforPonies> It will probably die out. Depending on how it goes. But I myself will still love it.
<Leonon> Also, Twilight Sparkle's burning rage is awesome
<Razyn> 0He's just known for giving over the top performances
<Discord> That depends on how well they keep up the show's quality.
<^Stargazer> I think I'm gonna have to go to bed, I cannot read because I keep dozing off lol
<Shaico> Hey Toq
<Shaico> Dammit
<Razyn> 0Check his work as Zetta in Makai Kingdom; that's my favorite
<Shaico> Torrent:
<User_8567> So, who here is part of another fandom?
<Torrent> Hey
<HaysforPonies> I'm part of the MS Paint Adventures fandom.
<^Stargazer> night everypony

*DerpyBot carries ^Stargazer off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks ^Stargazer in and hums a lullaby
<User_8567> Night
<Jenemmy> I agree.
<Spin> fnight
<Jenemmy> It sounds so fitting
<Discord> And yeah, an animated series getting even a SECOND season is fairly rare. I can see FiM getting... three seasons.
<Tenaris> night spy
<Kadreal> it sounds like season 2 has more funding
<MrMooMoo> Gran Turismo fandom
<User_8567> new to this whole fanbase thing. How big is the pony fanbase?
<Kadreal> so should be improved a bit
<Shaico> How u doin Torrent?
<HaysforPonies> Millions.
<Torrent> Good
<Razyn> 0http://youtu.be/VceqYerVw4s?t=1m13s
<MrMooMoo> Millions
<User_8567> Like
<Jenemmy> I love the idea of stars as voice actors, anyhow.
<User_8567> Compared to other fandoms
<Tenaris> Billion Views before season 5 xD
<Jenemmy> Do you think we'll ever get a Neil Patrick Harris pony.
<Jenemmy> *pony?
<HaysforPonies> Depends on current fandoms of things.
<GumballCrash|Sleep> I'd guess and say maybe 30-50k active members?
<Razyn> 0Damn, I was tired, but now I'm excited.
<GumballCrash|Sleep> wait, I'm supposed to be asleep
<MrMooMoo> Yes
*GumballCrash|Sleep snores
<Discord> 6,957,916,297 people are fans of FiM.
<Shaico> good good
<HaysforPonies> There are the timeless like video game franchises, Disney and Looney Tunes.
<Discord> Just not all of them know it yet.
<Razyn> 0Now it's my turn to play confused.
<Shaico> I am bored out of my mind now being at school.
<Leonon> we could make a town, a very strange town
<HaysforPonies> Then there are the new ones like MLP
<Jenemmy> Cue Dash fangirl squeal.
<GumballCrash|Sleep> a very awesome town
<User_8567> ummm hummm
<Spin> very big town
<Jenemmy> What is it that is confusing you?
<User_8567> contniue
<Paul_McColtney> !seen ^Rarity
<DerpyBot> Paul_McColtney: The last time I saw ^Rarity was Fri 19 Aug 2011 10:32:38 AM CEST
<Parchment_Scroll> There are actually more MLP fans than there are people on the planet.
<Kadreal> I find that most people I can talk into watching it like the show.
<Razyn> 0Dunno that guy's voice
<Jenemmy> Ik
<MrMooMoo> Err i gotta sleep, theres a Senior Sunrise thing happening in my school tomorow
<GumballCrash|Sleep> I've already found a handful of people that got halfway through the season then dropped it, couldn't care
<User_8567> oh
<Discord> See, I was using a number that was an estimate of the current world population. XD
<Jenemmy> Just the idea of an extremely popular actor or actress
<MrMooMoo> Cant miss it
<Kadreal> gonna try and hold a mare-athon at my work on the 17th, when the new season starts... donno who will be up for 9 hours of season 1 tho lol
<User_8567> oh my
<Tenaris> how many celeb's are bronies? i heard Bill clinton is a fan
<Jenemmy> Just an example
<Shaico> I can't wait for Season 2
<Shaico> wo
<Jenemmy> I hope we get Kevin McLeod
<Razyn> 0Naw, they should keep it low key, so they don't have to pay anyone too big
<Razyn> 0Case and point,
<Leonon> Vin Deasil likes it, he may not know he likes it yet though
<Jenemmy> Still
<Jenemmy> If I get ANYONE, it has to be Kevin McLeod.
<User_8567> Anypony doing a live stream? I don't have tv where I live, and I've no bronies near me to share the joy with
<User_8567> Well
<User_8567> The dude does play DND....
<Tenaris> i know seth green is a fan
<User_8567> Any suprise ther?
<Spin> can't wait for my first shirt to come fnally gonna have some pony swag
<Leonon> Seth Green was a fan before FiM
<Jenemmy> Still, Tara Strong is good enough for me
<Kadreal> I want seth green to guest star in an episode
<Tenaris> which makes it 20% cooler
<Kadreal> that'd be so bad ass
<Kadreal> his voice that is
<Jenemmy> She's amazing
<Razyn> 0Oh yeah. She's...
<MrMooMoo> weird al is a fan
<Jenemmy> Mad popular.
<Discord> You'll have to start the Mare-athon on the 16th, Kadreal, since there will barely be 9 hours in the day before Season 2 starts, and that's on the East coast.
<Razyn> 0"I could listen to her read the phonebook"
<Razyn> 0Got that from another show
<User_8567> PG gents. Some us have sesitive eyes...
<GumballCrash|Sleep> o_o
<Kadreal> yeah lol
<Razyn> 0Can only apply that to her
<Kadreal> We don't have the hub
<Shaico> How did people know Weird Al was a fan?
<GumballCrash|Sleep> nonstop 27 episode megathon starting at midnight on the 17th
<Shaico> I still don't get it.
<Jenemmy> Agreed.
<Kadreal> so 9 hours for a decent upload
<GumballCrash|Sleep> yes, yes, and more yes
<Wrek> 5DANGER DANGER, high voltage! when we kiss, when we touch...

<User_8567> Wait
<Jenemmy> Hey Wrek
<User_8567> Really?
<Spin> he posted soemthing on his twitter
<User_8567> Like
<User_8567> Legit?
<Kadreal> well, he liked the PMVs made with his music
<User_8567> He actually said that?
<Spin> ya
<Jenemmy> Just discussing Season two and VAs.
<Wrek> 5ohai
<MrMooMoo> He would like to be a guest stae
<Kadreal> he never said he was a 'brony' or that he directly like the show
<Razyn> 0Yo wrek
<MrMooMoo> Star
<User_8567> Ah
<Discord> Actually, I though he'd made a pony reference before the PMVs.
<Razyn> 0Hey, who do you think should be Discord's VA?
<Kadreal> but he did say he really liked the pmvs
<Wrek> 5*I am, the highlander*
<Jenemmy> Yeah, who?
<User_8567> Perhaps he wishes to reamin alooffor the time being
<Parchment_Scroll> Al-Hoof? (Double pun all the way across the sky!)
<Wrek> 5VA?
<Jenemmy> Voice Actor?
<Razyn> 0Voice actor

<Efreet_Eidolon> i mgonna go have a nap
<Wrek> 5then i'd definetly pick the guy who VA'd alexander in AMnesia
<Spin> night
<Parchment_Scroll> Night, MrMooMoo
<Efreet_Eidolon> for great justice
<Jenemmy> If a female can pull off a Cathy Weseluck, it works too.
<User_8567> may Luna guide your dreams
<Tenaris> im still hoping to find a season 2 stream because i heard streams for s1 were decently fun
<Parchment_Scroll> Good night cow, jumping over the MrMooMoo.
<Wrek> 5if you dont know who it is ill pull up a voice clip
<User_8567> FOR GREAT JUSTICE!
<bronyman> im sure there will be s2 streams
<Jenemmy> I looked him up
<Jenemmy> I've seen it before, refreshing my memory.
<Xiagu|alseep> yeah how do those work?
*MrMooMoo will try to dream about sweater dresses, and ponies...
<User_8567> So, nopony here is doing a stream then?
<Xiagu|alseep> I heard there are threads on ponychan before each episode with links to stream
<Spin> If not black market ponies will grow abundantly
<Jenemmy> So many people can pull off an evil voice, but only one is fit for the season two pilot.
<bronyman> even if there arent im pretty sure they'll be online within 105 seconds of airing anyway
<User_8567> I don't know too much about how streaming works...
<User_8567> You mean
<Dashite> Tony Jay. Too bad bad he's dead.
<User_8567> within
<User_8567> 10 seconds flat
<Leonon> take longer than 105 seconds, encoding and uploading takes time
<Jenemmy> :'(
<Razyn> 0Honestly, I think we need to know more about Discord
<Jenemmy> We do
<bronyman> i know just making a point :P

<AlphaOmega> but if you do a sentance that usualy used the word "It" but replace it with the word "night"
<Discord> Not so intimidating?! Now I expect to see a clown pony lurking in the sewers of a small Maine town, murdering foals.
<Vexed> omg
<Vexed> I'm glad I don't live in main
<Vexed> maine*
<Spin> I do
<Vexed> seen any clowns lately?

<Jenemmy> ...
<Spin> Tell me about we have killer mist clowns you name it
<Spin> *about it
<AlphaOmega> Kingdom hospital
<Spin> oh ya one the funner ones we got
<Discord> Stephen King takes "write what you know" to heart a little too much at time, what with all the terrible things happening in Maine and happening to authors and what have you.
<AlphaOmega> not to mention being hit by cars
<AlphaOmega> or was it a SUV or Van or something that he was hit by
<Leonon> it is funny in Misery when they wonder if reading the author's books will give a clue to his fate
<Discord> Strangely, he wrote Christine long, long before he was hit by a car.
<AlphaOmega> Wasnt thinking of Christine
<AlphaOmega> but Christine is the reason I didnt get my drivers licence till I was 32
<Discord> While I'm near 30 and don't have a licence not because I'm scared of cars, but because I'm scared of the stupid people in those cars.
<AlphaOmega> Welcome back from the musical musicness Octavia
<Spin> I 'm 16 and don't my license (trys to fit in)
<AlphaOmega> Spin You are a brony, you already fit in
<Octavia> thank you, AlphaOmega.

<Plorf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMAhCCZDwtU
<Discord> I have a learners. I've had the learners for about 10 years now. I actually had to renew my learners. Kinda ridiculous, right?
<Plorf> yes
<Plorf> I've had mine for several months, nothing too weird
<AlphaOmega> Learners makes a good ID card
<Plorf> it does, yes
<Plorf> But not for passports
<Plorf> I learned that the hard way
<Discord> Yeah, when I had to renew it, I was thinking of just getting the non-license government-issued ID, but the cost to renew the learners was the same, so I was like, eh, why not?
<AlphaOmega> Getting passports for me is annoying cos I have to do it though an embassy
<Discord> You want annoying? Lose your passport in another country. That was annoying.
<AlphaOmega> OK not done that.... I just had it expire in another country
<AlphaOmega> I live in Aussie, but I am considered a special visa case not a perminant visa case
<Discord> Luckily, the other country was just the States, so it wasn't too bad, but still.
<Radimir> I assume you're from Canada, Discord?
<Discord> You assume correctly.
<Radimir> I'd like to visit Canada someday. Seems like a nice place.
<Discord> (I was wondering how you guessed, but yeah, what other country would refer to America as, "Eh, it was just the States"?)
<Untamed> I wonder what they were thinking aboot when they made milkbags, eh?
<Spin> milkbags?
<Discord> I have never seen a bag of milk in my life. I have no idea where that idea comes from.
<Radimir> Well, I inferred that, as you didn't consider leaving your passport in the US that bad, it would have to be on the continent.
<Discord> I buy milk in jugs or cartons.
<Radimir> And your English is too good to reasonably guess that you're from Mexico.
<Spin> The only thing I associate with Canada is the bacon and Hockey and well the bacon pissed me off. Hockeys okay
<Spin> Well he could be from the UK
<Discord> You know what we call what you call Canadian bacon? Ham.
<Radimir> The UK isn't on North American continent...
<Spin> Ya I remember ordering pizza asking for bacon and got pissed when it came
<Untamed> He already said he was canadian
<Spin> Ya I didn't see you say the thing about the same continent
<Radimir> I don't think I was here.
<Discord> Yeah, a UK citizen losing their passport in the States would be in a bigger heap of trouble.
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyTlVIaOEjU
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<Discord> When I lost my passport, we'd only actually needed passports for the States for a couple years. We used to not need a passport to travel to the US.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about High Charity Suite
<Plorf> halo 2 soundtrack, anyone?
<Plorf> <_<
<Spin> Currently listening bringing back good memories

<Plorf> I didn't play it much in its peak, but I have also played it so many times
<MirthTinker> night all...adrenaline high from almost beating another Touhou coming down...crash and burrrrrrrn
<Plorf> I never actually owned an Xbox until relatively recently, a 360 even more recently, and Xbox Live more recently than that
<Plorf> but that was a great game
<Spin> Ya I replayed this game so many times cause I was too poor to get the 360 or halo 3 so I would just spend all my time on campaign

*DerpyBot grabs Ludovician and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
<Ludovician> meh
<Ludovician> that works too
<Vexed> !love
*DerpyBot returns with a cupcake with Ludovician's name etched into the frosting
<Radimir> Why on earth would you attempt such a thing.
<Vexed> why thank you derpy!
<Aristeo> Should be fixed
<Ludovician> hi shaico
<Aristeo> Looks like Subversion got uninstalled and forgot to tell Apache the news
<Shaico> hey guys
<Vexed> This canabalistic cupcake is a symbol of the love between derpy and I
<Vexed> Don't get between that!
<Ludovician> I still can't believe they put a cupcakes refernce in derpybot's scipt.
<Vexed> why's that hard to believe?
<Vexed> that story's pretty popular
<Ludovician> well, apparently
<Ludovician> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Radimir> Infamous or notorious may be a more appropriate term.
<Ludovician> Notorious, yes.
<Ludovician> Anyone gonna give Derpy a muffin?
<Vexed> yes!
<Vexed> yes
<Ludovician> hm
<Vexed> ...i guess not.
<Ludovician> she seems to have derped.
<Ludovician> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Vexed> no
*DerpyBot walks away with a drooping tail
<HotCocoa> Yes.
<HotCocoa> !muffin
*DerpyBot flies away to deliver important mail
<HotCocoa> Well.
<Vexed> aww
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Wakey wakey. How long was I out? Bah, who cares.
<HotCocoa> I see.
<Vexed> I thnik I hurt her feelings...
<HotCocoa> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<HotCocoa> Yes.
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps HotCocoa
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Muffins are delicious.
<Ludovician> !mail Derpybot bod
*HotCocoa subsequently glomps SillyNilly|Sketch because he's there.
<DerpyBot> For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
<Ludovician> x!mail Derpybot bod
<Ludovician> gah
<Ludovician> i meant box
<Ludovician> no
*DerpyBot walks away with a drooping tail
<Guest81622> ah
<Vexed> you think she'd still be curious as to what the bod contiains anyway
<Vexed> box*
<Ludovician> lol yea
<Ludovician> could be the ingredients for muffins
<Sketchy_Sounds> !mail DerpyBot 40lb box of rape
<DerpyBot> For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
<Sketchy_Sounds> yes.
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Sketchy_Sounds
<Vexed> maybe a certificate redeamable for a lifetime supply of muffins
<Ludovician> btw im curious
<Ludovician> is Dinky canon or is she a made-up pony?
<Radimir> There's not that much wheat in the universe if we're talking about Derpy, Vexed.
<Radimir> I -think- a filly that looks like her appeared in one episode.
<Vexed> Radimir lol
<Ludovician> and is a unicorn strangely enough
<Vexed> I always thought she was a fanmade pony
<Vexed> I demand source
<Ludovician> I demand sauce
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://pictures.mastermarf.com/blog/2008/081208-box-of-rape.jpg
<Ludovician> What sauce goes well with Vexed?
<Radimir> Mayo.
<Ludovician> lolwut Sketchy
<Vexed> mayo is not a sauce
<Vexed> and mayo is disgusting...
<BillyColt> Hullo
<Vexed> hi there
<Ludovician> 'ello there Bill!
<BillyColt> I just thought what would be a great musical theatre song for MLP to do a song based off of
<Ludovician> Rocky Horror
<BillyColt> Think more Sondheim
<BillyColt> "Sunday"
*Ludovician stares blankly.
<BillyColt> You know Rarity's song in "Suited For Success?"
<BillyColt> That was based off of a song from the musical "Sunday in the Park with George"
<Ludovician> That song is about 20% cooler than Rarity's other song.
<BillyColt> Well, that musical has another song in it called "Sunday," and it's really, really good.
<BillyColt> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVO9rN5Bk1A
<Ludovician> u gonna PMV it?
<BillyColt> No, but it'd be cool if the show wrote a song based off of it like Rarity's song or the Gala song.
<BillyColt> Both of those songs were based off of Sondheim pieces.
<Ludovician> anyway I've gotta go everypony
<Ludovician> later
<HaysforPonies> Off to bed as well. But first.
<HaysforPonies> !lullaby
*DerpyBot carries HaysforPonies off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks HaysforPonies in and hums a lullaby
<Vexed> hush now quiet now...
<HotCocoa> No.
<Vexed> Yes.
<HotCocoa> Okay.

<AlphaOmega> Ponies take priority of existance
<Radimir> Confound these ponies.
<cqmorrell> Coloring a pony-related pic now.
<AlphaOmega> ohhh cool!
<Radimir> They drive me to enjoy things that I would not have seen myself enjoying a few months ago.
<cqmorrell> ffffffffuuuuuuuu
<AlphaOmega> Like things that we as adults are sorta "forbidden" for us to enjoy anymore
<cqmorrell> I colored her dress wrong T_T
<Radimir> We must be mature and have jobs.
<Radimir> Buy homeware and appliances, have children.
<Radimir> Et cetera.
<cqmorrell> Yeah -_-;;
<Discord> (Note: Do not use the appliances on the children.)
<cqmorrell> Done with this pic, will brb.

<PhotoFinish> I, PhotoFinish,
<Closet-Brony> Like a bot!
<PhotoFinish> have arrived.
<Closet-Brony> cqmorrell: nice
<cqmorrell> Thanks
<Closet-Brony> np
<Closet-Brony> Now.... back to ponies...
<Closet-Brony> tab me if anything
<Aristeo> hmm
<FallSilently> DA MAGICKS
<Aristeo> Well
<Aristeo> I know that there's a trick that lawyers do when it comes to collecting settlements from piracy lawsuits
<Aristeo> IPs collected from torrent networks, like The Pirate Bay are often padded with fake IP addresses to prevent people from using it as evidence in court against anyone
<Aristeo> And giving people plausible deniability
<Closet-Brony> Episode 8: Look Before you Sleep
<Closet-Brony> I like this one :3
<cqmorrell> Going to sleep, good night, ttyl.
<Radimir> Night.
<Aristeo> But basically what the lawyers do to get around this is to send scary letters to all the IPs harvested .... they know they can't win in court but they hope that a small fraction of people will agree to settle for a couple thousand
<Aristeo> Guest81622, so, basically, the short answer is: Yes, I think they're bluffing
<Guest81622> Im not going to say anything
<Guest81622> if they send me to collections i dont care
<Guest81622> what will collections do? nothing
<Cracky> Guys
<Radimir> Ja?
<Guest81622> it will cost them more to send it there then they will get
<AlphaOmega> Ya?
<Guest81622> plus i will never buy from them again
<ForeverOdin> Yus?
<FallSilently> Helllew
<Cracky> Need to wake up in 3 hours to ho to pack
<Radimir> To ho?
<Radimir> Freudian slip, perhaps?
*FallSilently leans forwards
<Cracky> But my buddy is refusing to go to sleep
<Cracky> What do I do
<AlphaOmega> Watches as FallSilently falls on their face
<Radimir> Punch him.
<AlphaOmega> punch him with love and tolleration again and again
<Cracky> Done
<Radimir> Now, ask him nicely to go to sleep.
<Cracky> Hes playing tf2
<Radimir> What a casual.
<Cracky> Oh
<Cracky> It worked
<Radimir> Nah, but, pull out his ethernet cable or something.
<AlphaOmega> you know really sucks when you are playing TF2? damn modem shuts down
<Aristeo> They're hoping you're gullable enough to be scared by an authority
<Aristeo> I wouldn't worry about it
<Cracky> Loll
<Radimir> I rarely get that problem
<Guest81622> you know me
<Guest81622> im not :P
<Guest81622> But the only thing thats different now is that im 18
<Cracky> All problems can be solved by friendship
<AlphaOmega> sometimes I cause that problem I like having control of the router from my puter, I shut down everything elses connection but my own
<Cracky> Anyways thanks guys
<Guest81622> so i cant laugh at /everyone/ for stuff anymore.
<Closet-Brony> AlphaOmega: And I was thinking Dead ringers
<Radimir> I love the Dead Ringer
<Aristeo> Yeah I know you're not :P
<AlphaOmega> the BBC radio comedy show?
<Closet-Brony> Well I don't.... Even when playing as spy....
<Guest81622> they are a good company for servers
<Guest81622> i would hate to have to boycott them
<Aristeo> Is it volumedrive?
<Guest81622> no
<Guest81622> securedservers
<Aristeo> Ahh
<Cracky> Thanks for the help
<Cracky> Good night
<AlphaOmega> sleep well
<Cracky> Maybe see some of you tomorrow
<AlphaOmega> chances are I will be ehre
<AlphaOmega> here
<Guest81622> hey Aristeo do you think you can buy flexible oled lcds anywhere
<Aristeo> I'll let you know if I do
<Aristeo> I'll keep an eye out for them
<Guest81622> I envision a flexible 2 inch wide OLED band
<Guest81622> that is like a wristband
<Closet-Brony> Everones quitting >_>
<Closet-Brony> I dunno how to do the formal one
<AlphaOmega> I'll never quit you Bro!
<Radimir> IRC 4 lyf!
<Closet-Brony> That's wonderful to know but I'm a bit tired
<Closet-Brony> Radimir: I kinda showed you who's boss :p
<Closet-Brony> anyways... I'm acutally tired.... so I'm off
<Closet-Brony> and I leave in my informal and rough "Close Mozzilla in general" format :D
<Radimir> Wait, how so?
<Closet-Brony> Radimir: said you quit due to a peer connection reset
<Radimir> Yeah
<Radimir> Flash crashed
<Radimir> Because I'm too lazy to get Chatzilla.

<Efreet> oh.

<Radimir> Nup
<Radimir> Gonna go kill myself now
<Efreet> okay :(
<Efreet> I'll be sure to steal your name.
<Efreet> Wrack you up some heavy debt..
<Efreet> etc.
<Radimir> I thought you were mocking my name earlier? :P
<DannySwish> im bored...
<DannySwish> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, DannySwish!
<DannySwish> WEEEEEEEE!
<Efreet> doesn't matter that I was mocking it! I can still use it to wrack your name in debt! muahahahaha
<Radimir> Well, I'll... Take your name, and wreck it before I kill myself!
<Radimir> There'll be no consequences, either!
<Efreet> I shall change it!
*Efreet aims rocket launcher, don't ask where i got it from, because idfk either!
<Radimir> To Efreet?
<Radimir> Baha.
<Efreet> auuuugh
<Efreet> I want september to come around already.
<Efreet> :C
<Radimir> Yep.
<Radimir> At least QCS will be over.
<Efreet> Hey. Radimir.
<Efreet> Guess what!
<Radimir> wat
<Efreet> I never got exams this year.
<Efreet> or ever.
<Efreet> u jelly?
<Radimir> Ja.
<Efreet> ;3
<Efreet> I got a.. Math's assignment this week..
<Efreet> Then another test, then another assignment sometime later on.
<Efreet> oh god.
<Efreet> Once those three are finished. I've finished Maths for the year.
<Radimir> I have both QCS AND major block exams in the next two weeks.
<Radimir> These are pretty much the last set of exams that actually matter, too.
<Efreet> harharhar
<Efreet> Well. The only "Exam" I'm having is a Food Tech one..
<Efreet> But I don't really care for it.
<Efreet> I only had two options to pick from. Food Tech or D&T
<Radimir> D&T = Design and Tech, right?
<Efreet> Yeah.
<Radimir> That's the only subject that I don't actually have an exam for.
<Efreet> I'm horrible at both.
<Radimir> Lots of assignments due for it, though.
<Radimir> haha
<Radimir> It's probably actually my best subject
<Radimir> Particularly since I actually tried this year.
<Radimir> And, in saying that, I'm pretty sure that I'm the best in the subject in my grade.
<Efreet> Since I have a very.. weird personality that imagines the worst things happening to me while I do the practical stuff.
<Efreet> "I'm cooking what now?.. Oh god damn it."
<Efreet> end up imagining my fingers sprawled over a cutting board.
<Efreet> and me running around the room screaming.
<Efreet> :<
<Radimir> I don't really get that in tech.
<Radimir> I'm more concerned about the material getting stuck and sent flying or somethng.
<Efreet> Don't get me started on D&T. Last time I had it, I imagined I'd end up cutting off my own hand with the jigsaw
<Efreet> D:
<Efreet> Also. Listening to MK theme.
<Radimir> The jigsaw is a PoS.
<Radimir> You have to grip is really hard to prevent it from just going everywhere.
<Efreet> So. Radimir. What is the thing you're looking forward to for the rest of the year?
<Efreet> Well, Day, I should say.
<Radimir> Hmm.
<Radimir> I would say...
<Radimir> November 18.
<Efreet> November 11th here.
<Radimir> What happens then?
<Efreet> Skyriiiiiiiiiiim
<Efreet> Still Don't know what my first character's going to be.
<Radimir> Ooh
<Efreet> Thinking Imperial.
<Radimir> I'm probably gonna go
<Radimir> Argonian
<Efreet> Argonians look sexy.
<Radimir> If the race perks are anywhere near what they were in Oblivion
<Radimir> ...
<Untamed> Efreet..
<Untamed> I agree
<Efreet> From the screenies. They look awesome compared to Oblivion.
<Efreet> Gonna have to ask my Dad/Sister to take me up to Geraldton to get it from EBGames.
<Efreet> On the way up to Geraldton, I'll be giddy.
<Radimir> Yeah
<Efreet> On the way back, I'll be Pinkie Pie.
<Radimir> Most of the races look much better this time
<Radimir> Particularly the orcs.
<Efreet> Radimir.
<Efreet> 2nd character shall be a Nord.
<Efreet> Blonde hair.
<Efreet> Blue eyes.
<Efreet> Hammer in one hand.
<Efreet> Lightning spell in the other.
<Efreet> Guess his name.
<Radimir> Thor?
<Efreet> hi5
*Efreet high fives Radimir
*Radimir returns this.
<Efreet> ;D
<Efreet> >already know 2nd character
<Radimir> Apparently
<Efreet> >but not my first character.
<Radimir> There's also going to be same-sex marriage in it.
<RainbowBrisk> hey people
<RainbowBrisk> do me a favor
<Radimir> This raises the question: Why is there marriage in the Elder Scrolls?
<RainbowBrisk> if you get a chance to use an AT&T service
<BlacklightShining> http://arch.413chan.net/2797_-_derpy_hooves-(n1301378919270).jpg
<BlacklightShining> d'aww ^
<RainbowBrisk> and you can you ANY other service
<Efreet> Radimir.
<RainbowBrisk> don't use AT&T
<RainbowBrisk> for me :)
<Efreet> I'm going to totally..
<Efreet> Go into a tavern, make everyone end up drinking so much they pass out.
<Efreet> THen I shall pick pocket them all.
<RainbowBrisk> if you say "use AT&T to spite you" you'll just be doing yourself a disservice
<Radimir> Make it happen.
<Efreet> I can't wait to fight unscripted dragons.
<Efreet> Walking along in the forest, suddenly, dragon out of nowhere.
<Efreet> Radimir. Do you agree with me, the first mod for Skyrim, will be a nude mod.
<Radimir> Oh, definitely.
<Radimir> Closely followed by the mod to make everyone look like an anime character.
<Radimir> And then, the pony mod.
<Efreet> Yes.
<Sharksky> morning, everypony.
<Efreet> Afternoon, Sharksky.
<Efreet> ;D
<Efreet> c wut i did thur?
<Sharksky> :3

<Radimir> Nightly Roundup!
<Radimir> Sans title!
<Efreet> I question if Seth even sleeps. :V
<Radimir> I still maintain my theory
<Radimir> That he is a robot powered by images of Trixie.
<Efreet> Oh right.
<Efreet> Quick. Everypony draw images of Trixie and send them into Seth!
<Efreet> Put him into over drive
<Radimir> Just make sure he has a surge protector on.
<Efreet> that too.
<Radimir> And hello, SharkSky.
<BlacklightShining> inb4 Nightly Roundup notice
<Efreet> i can't even load it up :<
<Radimir> That Pinkie Pie Oblivion mod is horrid.
<Radimir> I wish that it did not exist.
<AlphaOmega> then dont play it?
<Sharksky> Pinkie Pie Oblivion mod?
<Sharksky> Oh hey, Radimir.
<Radimir> I'm just saying
<Radimir> It looks... Awful.
<Sharksky> I'm just saiyan.
<Efreet> oh
<Efreet> oh god it looks horrid.
<Efreet> Those cupcakes
<Efreet> look delicious
<Radimir> Clearly, somebody should have gotten halfway through designing this, thought 'wait, this is not Pinkie Pie. This is a pink horse'
<Radimir> And then stopped.
<Efreet> I want those cupcakes.
<Efreet> Damn it all!
<Sharksky> Radimir: I saw it, I lol'd.
<Sharksky> I wonder, if Seth has seen all the Trixie art.
<Radimir> Seen it, saved it, most likely fapped to all the pornographic art and some of the clean art.
<Efreet> elohel
<Sharksky> Oh dear God.
<Sketchy_Sounds> There's a mental image none of us needed D:
<Radimir> Don't pretend I'm not partially right.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh I'm not denying it
<Sketchy_Sounds> Just saying didn't need to think about it ;_;
<Radimir> Also, I love the layout of tonight's roundup.
<Radimir> blahblahblah sweetie bell
<Radimir> Have some news.
<Radimir> Then, out of nowhere, 'applejack money'.
<Radimir> For some reason, that's under the article, too, in small font.
<Radimir> Seth seems to have a peculiar obsession with Applejack Money.
<Radimir> To add mystery, the file is called, 'applemoneyassbag.png'.
<Radimir> I am confused.
<Efreet> because..
<Efreet> Applejack currency is the best currency.
<Efreet> Next to Pinkie Pie currency, atleast.
<Radimir> Fluttershy currency is worthless, since she just hands it out to whoever needs it.
<Sharksky> Dat Applejack money
<Radimir> Damn socialist.
<Radimir> Or, perhaps that's Rarity, since she's the Element of Generosity.
<Sharksky> Wat.
<Sharksky> Nopenopenope.
<Radimir> ?
<Sharksky> You heard me.
<Efreet> I read you. But I didn't hear you.

<Larscis> Happy Women's Equality Day, everypony.
<Sharksky> Y'know what would be awesome? If the clock on the logo for Equestria Daily was actually moving.
<Larscis> And there is another holiday today as well, but mentioning them together...it'd just be in poor taste.
<Radimir> They can celebrate by making me a sammich with equal amounts of ham and cheese.
<Sharksky> Women's Equality Day today?.
<Larscis> Yes.
<Efreet> wait
<Efreet> women havea day?
<Radimir> Yeah
<Efreet> news to me!
<Radimir> Next thing you'll know
<Radimir> They'll want to vote.
<Efreet> they'll have a weekend!
<Efreet> Then.. a week..
<Efreet> then a month!
<Efreet> and then the god damned year!
<Sharksky> The OPs are asleep let's be evil.
<Radimir> Also, Larscis: What is the holiday?
<Efreet> OPs are asleep
<Efreet> discuss cupcakes.
<Larscis> Radimir: National Dog Day.
<Efreet> wat.
<Sharksky> I'm more inclined to muffins.
<Sharksky> National Dog Day?
<Sharksky> Hahahahahaha!
<Efreet> Muffincupcakes.
<Sharksky> Cupfins
<Efreet> Muffincakes.
<Radimir> Fuck I'm now sad, I had a bad thought due to reading that combination of words.
<Radimir> Oh, god, why why why why I'm so damn sad now.
<Efreet> wut?
<Sharksky> Let's discuss pretty ponies.
<Radimir> Muffincupcakes.
<Sharksky> Like Rarity. :3c
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie is not crazy.
<Efreet> She's just hyper.
<Radimir> I imagined Cupcakes, with Derpy in the place of, uhh... Yeah.

<Sharksky> That Shaico guy is weird.
*Shaico twitches.
<Radimir> <3
<Sharksky> Hehehe.
<Efreet> Shaico sounds like a butt.
<Larscis> Sharksky: Because you know that no matter how much progress we make in our lifetimes, our world will never be as perfect as Equestria?
<Shaico> Are you doing this on purpose
<Shaico> ;(
<Radimir> Just to tease you. :3
<Efreet> Maybe.
<Sharksky> Larscis: NOOOOOOO!
<Shaico> I most certainly not like a butt.
<Sharksky> I don't wanna read what you just said
<Efreet> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IZa8RVWPI2c/TkG6USk3AGI/AAAAAAAAKHY/yUOnSmvVoac/s1600/43021+-+bad_touch+shark+twilight_sparkle.jpg
<Sharksky> but I already did....
<Efreet> Landsharks.
<Efreet> Ponies worst enemies.
<Larscis> Sharksky: I just had a talk with the ships computer. It hates me.
<Shaico> Grr newfags everywhere.
<Radimir> The anatomy in that picture is... Questionable.
<Shaico> gneifsoeif
<Sharksky> I landshark, therefore I am.
<Radimir> How ever shall you go on, Shaico?
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie..
<Efreet> Landsharks worst enemy.
<Shaico> And that landshark is eating Twilight's plot.
<Radimir> Which is somehow extending greatly beyond her rear legs.
<Efreet> Don't worry Twilight. Pinkie Pie'll save you!
<Shaico> idgi
<Sharksky> >idgi
<Sharksky> ? :V
<Efreet> i don't get it?
<Efreet> i think
<Sharksky> Makes sense.
<Shaico> What'd I tell ya? Newfags. :(
<Sharksky> What are you talking about.
<Efreet> hay. i'm not a newfag.
<Efreet> i'm a lurker.
<Radimir> I'm still not entirely sure how you define somebody as a newfag, Shaico.
<Shaico> Newfags. Y'know.
<Efreet> there's a difference!
<Shaico> Radimir, I am bored.
<Radimir> Watch ponies.
<Efreet> Your face is bored, Shaico.
<Shaico> I want to watch season 2 already.
<Radimir> Or, play with loaded guns.
<Radimir> Either are effective in relieving boredom.
<Efreet> Shaico.
<Efreet> With that comment..
<Shaico> Stop pinging me.
<Efreet> You have just delayed Season 2 by a week.
<Sharksky> Play with Loaded guns, start cleaning it. Ignore the chambered round.
<Shaico> No I didn't.
<Larscis> Radimir: I prefer to launch things with my trebuchet.
<Shaico> Last I checked, it's still September 17.
<Sharksky> Play with Loaded dice, start playing it. Ignore the gentleman with a gun.
<Efreet> they have yet to announce it.
<Larscis> So far, the record has been set by the engine block of an Oldsmobile Eighty Eight
<Sharksky> It's confirmed, Efreet.
<Radimir> It is September 17.
<Shaico> Yeah they did.
<Efreet> ffffffff-
<Shaico> Why ffff?
<Radimir> As the large notice at the top of the site says.
<Sharksky> Efreet, read the article for it if you find it.
<Shaico> You should be happy.
<Efreet> you're all party poopers :C
<Sharksky> Trying to be a master troll? Nope.
<Shaico> Oh stop being such a saddle sore.
<Shaico> xD
<Sharksky> Shaico: OH YOU.
<Sharksky> Hehehe.
<Efreet> inb4lonesomeroad'sdelayed.
<Radimir> Yes, stop being such an adjective.
<Shaico> o.O
<HomingoDeFuego> Hey guys.
<Sharksky> The Lonesome Road...
<HomingoDeFuego> New topic!
<Efreet> Watch. Bethesda shall delay Lonesome Road for the 3rd time. :(
<Shaico> Don't care about Lonesome Road.
<HomingoDeFuego> Ponies!
<Sharksky> Delayed? NO!
<Shaico> I don't play video games anymore.
<Efreet> Sharksky. 20th of September, hopefully.
<Shaico> My sob story of a man who gave up video games.
<Radimir> Go on.
<Shaico> I stopped playing video games.
<Sharksky> Tell us, about your story Shaico.
<Shaico> The end. Kinda sucks.
<Efreet> They were too violent for your parents, so they stripped them from you.
<Sharksky> Oh.
<Shaico> Nah, my 360 first broke.
<Shaico> And I was like, "Meh, screw it."
<HomingoDeFuego> Shaico..
<HomingoDeFuego> You are 15 years old.
<Efreet> .. Yeah. My holidays start on the 30th of september.
<HomingoDeFuego> You are not a man.
<HomingoDeFuego> BUT A BOY!
<Efreet> End on the 14th of October.
<Sharksky> I enjoyed my NES
<Shaico> Fine, boy works as well.
<Sharksky> I played the crap outta Super Mario 2.
<Efreet> I have 2 weeks worth of school to go through.
<Radimir> Wait, Shaico is 15?
<Shaico> I went through hell at school.
<Shaico> Yes, I am Radimir.
<Shaico> Problem?
<Efreet> Yes.
<Radimir> This actually explains quite a bit.
<Efreet> There is a large problem here.
<Sharksky> He's 15? Whoa. what..
<Radimir> In particular, your affinity to calling people 'newfags'.
*Sharksky is now questioning his morals.
<Shaico> Nah I was literally bored.
<Efreet> Sharksky.
<Sharksky> The internet has forsaken us.
<Efreet> Guess what.
<Efreet> CHLOROFORM!
<Sharksky> CHLOROFORM!
<Shaico> And Radimir, you only saw me call people newfags once or twice today.
*Sharksky shoves a rag in Efreet's throat!
<Efreet> ohgodwha
<Radimir> I've seen you do it before. On multiple days.
<Shaico> I hardly think I have an affinity to call people newfags.
<Lunasta> O.O
*Sharksky shoves Efreet down his cellar and starts digging a new grave.
<Lunasta> What in the name did I walk into?
*Efreet slumps down ontop of Sharksky and crushes him
<Radimir> Oh, hey, it's Lunasta.
<Shaico> I don't recall except that time I called BigMac a newfag.
<Shaico> And hi Lunasta! :o
<Radimir> I'm judging Shaico because he's younger than me.
<Radimir> Meh. I don't care that much, really.
<Lunasta> Shaico :D
*Lunasta hugs Shaico
*Shaico hugs Lunasta.
<Sharksky> You can't leave!
<Shaico> :o
<Lunasta> lol hey erryone
<Sharksky> Guardians of Equestria
<Sketchy_Sounds> oh hai
<Shaico> Now that I have revealed my age, using my age against me will come soon.
<Sharksky> >Sketchy_Sounds is now half-OP
<Sharksky> I like it.
*Sharksky likes everything.
*Shaico likes everything also.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh right yeah I am I guess.
*Radimir hates everything.
<Radimir> Rargh. I'm so edgy.
<Sharksky> No, I like everything more than you, Shaico. :V
<Shaico> Funny I was just about to say "Except Sharksky" :P
<Shaico> You ninja.
<Sharksky> But... I like you :<
<Shaico> Well that's too bad.
<Shaico> Sorry.
<Shaico> :\
<Sharksky> :<
<Lunasta> D: WHAT. SKETCHY IS NOW A HALFOP!? FIREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Sketchy_Sounds> u mad?
*Lunasta gets his shotguns and buys a pitchfork "Revolution!"
*Sharksky is now imagining Sketchy putting on a trollface...
<Shaico> Sketchy_Sounds, what did I tell you about ass-kissing?
<Sharksky> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Sharksky> Yes!
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Sharksky
<Sketchy_Sounds> Apparently everything I needed to know, Shaico
<Sketchy_Sounds> :D
<Shaico> Well congrats then.
<Shaico> You have been taught well.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hurr
<Sharksky> Hmmm...
<Shaico> My chat killing abilities.
<Lunasta> Dammit, I'm leaking spots
<Shaico> They are legendary.
<Lunasta> Gotta write more
<Radimir> We should discuss
<Sharksky> Shaico, what's legendary? :3
<Radimir> Something mildly-controversial.
<Sharksky> Radimir, get to writing your tropico thing.
<Sketchy_Sounds> omg controversy
<Sharksky> >:U
<Shaico> Pokemon that are hard to find.
<Radimir> But I want to wait for Tropico 4, first.
<Radimir> So I can steal stuff from that.
<HomingoDeFuego> Yes Lunasta ?
<Sharksky> When is it released?
<HomingoDeFuego> You called?
<Radimir> Uhh
<Radimir> 2nd, I think.
<Sharksky> 2nd of Sept?
<Radimir> Yes.
<Radimir> However!
<Radimir> I have conceived of a possible starting point, and something of an ending.
<Sharksky> Go on.
<Radimir> So that's a start, at least.
<Sharksky> Yay!
*Sharksky wants to know more.
*Lunasta leers at Fireant while muttering something indistinct under his breath
*HomingoDeFuego hugs Lunasta.
<HomingoDeFuego> There there.
<Radimir> I shall Steam you, so these plebians do not steal my ideas.
<HomingoDeFuego> You can still watch while others gets mod powers!
<Shaico> I'm literally one of the very first ponies on this chat that isn't a mod.
<Shaico> Along with Fiddler and Mongoose.
<Shaico> Come to think of it, where is Mongoose?
<Shaico> !seen Mongoose
<DerpyBot> Shaico: The last time I saw Mongoose was Fri 26 Aug 2011 02:11:50 AM CEST
<Balloons> That reminds me, i need to ban you for a day so i can be first in the days for the stats :)
<Shaico> Balloons, don't you dare.
<Balloons> xD
<Sketchy_Sounds> lmao
<Radimir> What a cheat.
<Shaico> Dirty fighting. No honor whatsoever. I expected more from an OP. Tsk tsk.
<BitZero> Who needs honor.
<Shaico> Anyone have the links to stats?
*Lunasta hugs Shaico "Nein Fireant! Shai, let us be nonmods together :D"
*Lunasta kicks his internet
*Shaico squees in glee. "Yes, lets!"
<HomingoDeFuego> I will mod Shaico.
<HomingoDeFuego> Done.
*HomingoDeFuego trollface at Lunasta
<Balloons> :O
<Shaico> Woah
*Shaico grins evilly.
*Lunasta kicks his internet even more "Stupid thing is lagging"
<Shaico> The power... IN MY HAND!
*Shaico bursts into a maniacal laugh.
<Lunasta> FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

<johnsey> eeeeeyup
<Shaico> Good to know, though I don't think you'll be pleased to know that the chat is currently... dead
<johnsey> then we should hide it before somepony gets the wrong ideas and....

<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<AlphaOmega> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps AlphaOmega
<RainbowBrisk> i have a favor
<RainbowBrisk> the favor is this
<RainbowBrisk> if you ever meet an AT&T employee
<RainbowBrisk> do bad things to him or her.
*Coz is away: I shall return *Poof*
<RainbowBrisk> also: wow you can go through seasons of arrested development FAST if you're bored.
*Coz is back (gone 00:00:02)
<Shaico> !mail RainbowBrisk Hi
<DerpyBot> Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
<Lunasta> !ping
<RainbowBrisk> my friend's friend (i don't know him very well) is in the army
<RainbowBrisk> or he was
<Lunasta> >.>
<RainbowBrisk> i think he's in reserve
<RainbowBrisk> point is
<RainbowBrisk> whenever he does something for his position
<RainbowBrisk> he and his friends say stuff like "i have to go to army"
<RainbowBrisk> ...it's an.. uhh, arrested development joke.
<RainbowBrisk> yaknow?
<RainbowBrisk> ha ha
<RainbowBrisk> ok
<RainbowBrisk> no sale.
<RainbowBrisk> that's fine.
<Shaico> Stop spamming.
*Lunasta is looking at the mad one in the middle of the chat
<RainbowBrisk> i don't think i'm spamming
<Efreet> rrrh
<Efreet> I hate it when my dad unplugs me form the router.
<RainbowBrisk> though occassionally i tend to type in short lines.
<Efreet> from, even.
<RainbowBrisk> but usually that is for effect.
<Shaico> RainbowBrisk: That is spamming.
<RainbowBrisk> sounds like writing in short lines to me.
<RainbowBrisk> spamming involves repetative posting of things
<RainbowBrisk> over and over, in order to bother the channel
<Shaico> Yes. And I see your name.
<Shaico> Over and over again.
<RainbowBrisk> i don't believe i'm bothering the channel but if you would like to take it up with a mod or something i would not mind going "on trial" as it were.
<Shaico> Well whatever floats your boat.
<RainbowBrisk> it's up to you
<RainbowBrisk> i have no problem with my own mannerisms.
*Lunasta gets his double barrel and shoots RainbowBrisk "Hold your enter finger"
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hm
<Sketchy_Sounds> !moon RainbowBrisk
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, RainbowBrisk!
<Efreet> Hey. Sketchy_Sounds. Guess what!
*Lunasta realizes that he accidentally shot buckshot and not the candy cane flechettes
<Lunasta> Oops.
<Shaico> :o
<RainbowBrisk> so i was spamming, then?
<Shaico> That's what I said, yes.
<RainbowBrisk> i didn't think so and i'd like to appeal this claim.
<Shaico> Stop being so goddamn formal.
<RainbowBrisk> i'm just being me :|
<Efreet> durnit, Sketchy_Sounds! Guess!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Meh?
<Efreet> Ponies!
<Efreet> poniesponiesponiesponiesponies.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I approve
<Lunasta> Heh, my quote.
<RainbowBrisk> well i was kicked for what i thought was no reason.
<Shaico> Swag!
<RainbowBrisk> which bothers me.
<Lunasta> inb4 inb4 inb4ception
<Shaico> RainbowBrisk: Mod's word is law.
<Shaico> Deal with it.
<Shaico> I had to deal with it also.
<RainbowBrisk> not if mods can be reasoned with :)
*Shaico is still in disbelief that Sketchy_Sounds is mod.
<RainbowBrisk> half mod is still mod.
<Shaico> *half-OP
<RainbowBrisk> op
<BitZero> We're unreasonable, illogical, irrational, incompetent Draconians.
<Lunasta> ikr Shai.
<RainbowBrisk> same thing
<Shaico> xD
<RainbowBrisk> well that's kind of annoying, isn't it?
<Efreet> He's only half. His word is only half law.
<Shaico> RainbowBrisk: Suck up your pride would you?
<RainbowBrisk> the unreasonable, illogical, irrational, incopetent draconians part.
<Efreet> I decide what half of his word tof ollow!
<RainbowBrisk> Shaico: i'm on in that habit.
<Shaico> i'm only following his dumb words.
*Shaico hugs Sketchy_Sounds.
<RainbowBrisk> and right now Ron Howard narrates everything in my head which just makes me more headstrong.
<DannySwish> i iz loopy :D
*Sketchy_Sounds is hugged
<RainbowBrisk> i mean, assuming he's strong. i don't know him
<AlphaOmega> Let us keep things civil and befitting us as Bronies
<Sketchy_Sounds> RainbowBrisk: tbh that was more about testing whether I could do that than anything else, although using the Enter key for a spacebar can be a bother sometimes.
<Shaico> AlphaOmega: We quarrel amongst ourselves for fun at times.
<Efreet> Everypony.
<Efreet> I know how to settle this.
<Efreet> !flip
*DerpyBot flips a muffin
*DerpyBot catches the muffin with her hoof, correct side up
<Efreet> No-one is right!
*Efreet prances around like an idiot
<Shaico> Gasp.
<Shaico> !flip
*DerpyBot flips a muffin
*DerpyBot catches the muffin with her hoof, upside down
<BitZero> We are all left.
<Efreet> Yes. We're all left.

<AlphaOmega> I am half left
<Efreet> ...
<Efreet> !flip
*DerpyBot flips a muffin
*DerpyBot catches the muffin with her hoof, upside down
<Shaico> I don't even know what's going on anymore.
<Efreet> No-one is left!
<Shaico> xD
<Radimir> Mitt Romney is right.
<Lunasta> If you were all left or right, would that make you half left or right?
<Shaico> I-i-i... I don't know!
*Shaico runs screaming into the horizon.
<Lunasta> Aww come back Shai!
*Lunasta chases after Shaico
*Shaico sees Lunasta chasing after him and stops his running.
<Lunasta> I probably should start my homework, but homework be damned!
<Efreet> In it's natural habitat, the Brony makes extremely random comments.. why this is, is completely unknown.. It is believed to be a ritual.
<MrPoniator> hey-o
<AlphaOmega> Efreet: I heard that in David Attenbourghs voice
<Efreet> I'm glad you did.

<Nuclear> Morning Lunasta
<Efreet> Delicious Chicken Kebabs
<Efreet> ..
<Rease> morning all
<Efreet> WHY IS MY MOUTH BURNING OHGOD
<Shaico> Lunastaaaaaaa
<Sharksky> Efreet: You ate too much spider venom
<Semysane> Not sure I want to know what that's about
<Efreet> Oh.
<Efreet> That's right.
<Efreet> I fought a few funnelwebs today.
<Efreet> Needed something to wash down their flesh.
<Sharksky> Stop testing your invulnerabilities to spider venom :<
<Efreet> My mouth is still burning from it.
<Efreet> no
<Efreet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50rJNCEL1Z4&feature=related
*Semysane shudders
<Semysane> Haaaaate spiders.
<Semysane> Not in a hide-in-the-corner way, though
<Efreet> Well then Semysane.
<Semysane> More of a smash-it-with-first-available-object way
<Efreet> Don't come to Australia.
<Larscis> More of a kill-it-with-fire way?
<Semysane> HAHAHAHA NO
<Efreet> Our spiders are larger then cars.
<Semysane> At least here in Canada our dangerous animals have the good manners to at least be huge and scary looking
<Efreet> our spiders.
<Semysane> at least at least at least
<Efreet> they are larger then cars.
<Semysane> Tiny-ass cars
<Efreet> No
<Efreet> Larger then SUVs
<Efreet> good sir.
<Semysane> lol
<Efreet> do you know nothing about australia?
<Efreet> Our spiders have manabars.
<Semysane> But have you ever seen one of them fight a drop-bear?
<Efreet> no
<Efreet> i haven't.
<Semysane> LAME
<rachel> haha
<Efreet> by the time i hear a drop bear dropping down, and turn around, the spider's already dead and the dropbear is gone.
<Semysane> Man, we don't have any good mythical animals here
<Semysane> All we have is Ogopogo, which is a lake monster, but has the lamest name ever.
<Leonon> you have elk
<Efreet> ..
<Efreet> LOL
<Efreet> That name.
<Efreet> Ogopogo
<Semysane> I know, right?
<Efreet> It's too hilarious to be scary.
<Semysane> IIRC, Ogopogo is a protected species though, just in case
<Efreet> 76 days.
<Gilda> Hey, what's up.
<Efreet> Until Skyrim.
<Locke> For me Sonic Generations has priority over Skyrim
<Semysane> he made it on a stamp, though, which is awesome: http://www.pibburns.com/cryptost/can1292z.jpg
<Semysane> I'm taking a "wait and see" approach to Generations
<Efreet> ... damn it i lol'd
<Efreet> Logopogo!
<Semysane> Been burned too many times before
<Semysane> lol, the text has to be in English and French on stamps
<Locke> I preordered it.
<Semysane> Well, good luck then
<Semysane> I just got my preordered Deus Ex the other day, and I am LOVING it
<Locke> Well in my oppionion none of the games have been that bad exept for 06. Even then I could tolerate that game.
<Leonon> you preordered Deus Ex and JUST got it?
<Locke> Then there was sonic chronicles, but that was one bioware's hands.
<Gilda> Sonic games? Yeah they used to be good.
<Semysane> Leonon: just got it THE OTHER DAY
<Semysane> Been playing it nearly non-stop since, lol
<Leonon> Wow, did it get lost in the mail?
<Semysane> ... It's only been out for a few days
<Semysane> Oh, god, lol
<Leonon> it's been out since like 2001
<Semysane> Deus Ex: HUMAN REVOLUTION
*Locke never saw what everyone had against most of them. Or more acuratly I saw what people had against it, it was just horribly exagerated.
<Gilda> 06 was drek, though. Take two steps forward and another five-minute loading screen boots up.
<Semysane> Speaking of, that's my main gripe with the new Deus Ex, the loading times are atrocious
<Leonon> what are you playing it on?
<Locke> Yeah 06 was the only one where I agreed with people.
<Gilda> I thought Unleashed was cool. Sure the werehog sections dragged out a bit and it didn't feel like real Sonic but they were still cool. The day stages were all epic.
<Locke> I listened to people complain about shadow the hedgehog for three years before getting it. Then I was like "And the big problem is?". Honestly the game played fine. Sure the vehicles were broken but there was never any part that actually made you use them.
<Locke> Exept that one mission that's really hard withought using the moter cycle
<Gilda> And that Cool Edge day music - sheer awesome.
<Gilda> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa11tMeCqNE
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Sonic Unleashed &quot;Holoska - Cool Edge Day&quot; Music
<Semysane> Leonon: playing it on the 360
<Gilda> Sorry, bud, but Shadow was a turd.
*Locke shrugs
<Leonon> have you put it on the harddrive?
<Gilda> Shadow moved funny. Kept sliding around. That was my major grief.
<Gilda> It was the first of many.
<Sketchy_Sounds> FIND THE KOMPYUTA ROOM!
<Locke> Find the chaos emerald!
<Gilda> Find Froggy!
<Locke> Which is right in front of the computer room so I don't see why you can't just snatch the emerald then head for the room.
<Semysane> Leonon: not nearly enough space to try that
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pee while doing a handstand without getting hit!
*Gilda blows on her fringe feathers.
<Gilda> Computer room's for dweebs.
*Sketchy_Sounds resists the urge to ask Gilda if she likes bananas
<BlacklightShining> inb4 stats update notice (1, 4:01:23)
<Gilda> What?
<Radimir> Please explain what is not for dweebs.
<Efreet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sBe20wYXT0&feature=feedu
<Efreet> ...
<Radimir> That list seems shorter, at this point, than things that are and are for dweebs.
<Efreet> Why does skate 3 induce fits of laughter?
<Owloysius> Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
<Semysane> Ha, I love GameFails
<Efreet> http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/560917821008331268/4DF7B03B57FB5E855EB29ACFCD2E8DF4291BA881/

*Gilda looks at the owl flying overhead.
<Efreet> What happened to my hand?!
<Gilda> Hey. That owl belong to anyone?
<Locke> Skate three is lulz in its highest magnitude
<Locke> I think it belongs to Twilight
<Radimir> Damn, Efreet.
<Radimir> You broke your fingers
<Radimir> You punched so hard.
<Semysane> Oh god, your hand!
<Gilda> That's too bad. Well, I ain't hungry anyhow.
<Efreet> I'm pretty sure the Saturnite Fist did that to me!
<Sharksky> For a second there, I thought there was another nightly roundup...
<Sketchy_Sounds> "Because airships are cool"
<Efreet> Radimir.
<Locke> Airships ARE cool just ask final fantasy or Sky's of Arcadia
<Efreet> You did the exact same response as someone else who I showed it to.
<Radimir> I am that person.
<Efreet> oh my god
*Semysane head a splode
<Efreet> my mind is full of buck.
*Locke bucks Efreet's mind
*Locke has to refresh
<Efreet> My mind!
<Semysane> If your mind is full of buck, you need to take cover from the guy with the shotgun
<Efreet> But I am the guy with the shotgun..
<Efreet> ..
*Efreet stuck in perpetual cover taking.
<Semysane> lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> You mean Skies of Arcadia
*Gilda reads the detailed stats page
<Gilda> Haaww yeah. ALL AWESOME:
<Variable> Locke is back
<Semysane> Sounds like me in Deus Ex. I never realized how FUN going stealthy could be. I always found it irritating in games like Metal Gear Solid
<Efreet> Playing as a stealth character in new vegas isn't fun to me.. :C
<VariableRadius> I played Splinter Cell and Hitman. I love going stealthy
<Radimir> I like how there is a grenade minigun.
<Radimir> Ooh
<Efreet> Simply because the AI is like "Wut.. someone got shot? Oh well."
<Radimir> I need to finish Blood Money
*VariableRadius also played stealth in Oblivion
<Radimir> The Mardi Gras mission is so frustrating.
<VariableRadius> The whole game is fustrating, but that's why I love it.
<Radimir> I just hate having the follow the first bird guy for ages
<Radimir> Through the crowds
<Radimir> Try to sedate
<Radimir> WTF ARE YOU DOING
<Efreet> Everypony.
<Efreet> I would like to make it known.
<Efreet> I hate birds.
<Radimir> I have a friend who loves birds.
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: You Are Now Twilight Sparkle (http://tinyurl.com/44robtx)
<Efreet> They keep swoopiong at me :<
<VariableRadius> So what does that mean for Gilda?
<Semysane> Been there. We have these annoying singsongy birds that love to start up the moment I fall asleep
<Efreet> Gilda's a griffon, there's a difference.
*Gilda doesn't "singsong"
<Radimir> He only half-hates Gilda.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Awesome, one of the most recent links on the stats is my 40lb box of rape.
<Radimir> >Not measuring rape in metric
<Efreet> Cast magic missle.
<VariableRadius> Sweet
*VariableRadius has a gunblade. If it counts for anything
<Radimir> Magic missile!

*Semysane attacks the darkness
<VariableRadius> What! Why?
<Semysane> Old internet meme reference
<Radimir> The attack is absorbed by the darkness!
<JackiePie> Hi
<Radimir> GET OUT.
<Radimir> Hi.
<Efreet> Radimir.
<Efreet> Have you seen Gintama before?
<Radimir> I have never heard of that.
<Efreet> If you have. Why do all the videos make me question my sanity?
<Radimir> It appears to be anime.
<Radimir> I would imagine that is the reason.
<Efreet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yi85ov08Kg&feature=related
<Radimir> In addition, it also means that I will never watch it.
<Efreet> just try looking at that scene.
<VariableRadius> So what do you guys call it when some one is RPing an unbeatable character?
<Efreet> godmod
<Radimir> So, like
<Radimir> Could somebody please explain why weeaboos like the Japanese language so much?
<Semysane> waaaat
<VariableRadius> Thats what we called it too.
<Radimir> It sounds like continuous whining.
<Efreet> It's hilarious.
<Efreet> :(
<VariableRadius> To you I guess.
<VariableRadius> Most of the song sin my computer are Japanese.
<VariableRadius> That or they come from video games.
<Radimir> Maybe I'm just thinking of anime voice acting, but wow.
<Efreet> Herpes! Herpes meee!
<Radimir> Shrill, high-pitched harpies.
<Semysane> I once heard a Francophone describe English as sounding like the speaker is constantly choking
<Radimir> I often wonder what English sounds like to somebody who doesn't understand it.
<VariableRadius> Most people I know describe German as sounding perpetually pissed off.
<VariableRadius> or was that russian?
<Semysane> Probably like odd gibberish with the occasional word stolen from the speaker's language
<Radimir> I would imagine Russian.
<Radimir> That said, I would LOVE to be able to speak Russian, along with Arabic.
<Radimir> Both sound badass.
<Lunasta> .o.
<Lunasta> Radimir is a spy!
<Radimir> Mandarin could also probably be useful.
<Semysane> German is fun for making people think you're really pissed off with them
*Lunasta spawns as a pyro and lights Radimir on fire
<VariableRadius> Chris describe French as sounding like theres something always stuck in your throat.
<BlacklightShining> 'night everypony

<VariableRadius> Read?
<Radimir> Sorry to pop in unannounced, Lunasta.
<Semysane> I'll be all "WHERE IS THE LIBRARY!?" and they'll be all "Shit, what did I do!?"
<Radimir> I would screw up a spell.
<Radimir> As I mentioned on the post.
<rachel> ah someone already made the point in comments
<Efreet> i would cast magic missile
<VariableRadius> I would cast Agidyne.
<Semysane> I would go read a book.
<Semysane> I am not very interesting
<Semysane> Wait, Agidyne?
<Radimir> I would probably be adorkable
<Semysane> Isn't that a powerful fire spell from Shin Megami Tensei?
<VariableRadius> Agidyne=Firaga
<Efreet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOc_N0mYe18&feature=related
<Radimir> Because adorkable!Twilight is best Twilight.
<Efreet> why is fluttershy so cute
<Efreet> D:
<Radimir> Hey, Efreet, I'm gonna link you something on Steam, since it's not PG.
<Semysane> Just send him a PM
<VariableRadius> I wants linkis
<Radimir> ...I'll just post in EAD.
<VariableRadius> darn it. I don't dare to pass the doors into that domain.
<Semysane> just type /msg VariableRadius and it should just be visible to him
<Semysane> I think
*VariableRadius shrugs.
<Semysane> I just tested it by sending a message to myself
<Semysane> Assuming no one else saw it, it's nice and private
<johnsey> you need to be registered and identified though
<VariableRadius> I saw it! Not really
<Semysane> lol
<Radimir> I like the comic.
<Radimir> It amuses me heavily.
<Semysane> Ah, didn't realize that johnsey
*VariableRadius enjoys this artist
<mook> my last gpu was able to run ok @90C while this 8600gts crashes at 80...
<Radimir> Generally, you don't want to be at either temperature.
<Radimir> I should not be able to fry an egg on any part of my PC.
<Semysane> Oh, wow, it's 4:21 am. I better get to bed before sunrise
<Semysane> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Semysane!
<Radimir> That said, it implies that I want to eat fried eggs.
<VariableRadius> Fluttershy- Fy like a butterfly
<Lunasta> I probably need to reinstall Win7 or get a northbridge cooler or both.
<VariableRadius> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrmBWreLLiw&feature=player_embedded#!
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<Lunasta> My NB is roasting at 100-110C on a little dinky aluminum heatsink
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about JSRF-FLY LIKE A BUTTERFLY
<Cracky> Hi everypony
<VariableRadius> and that is my new fluttershy song!
<Daz> Omagad, it works!
<Cracky> Who is in here at this damnable hour of day?
<mook> my nb is ~50C at high loads, but my rig is quite outdated
<VariableRadius> Where is that damn fourth elemnt of haromny?

<Cracky> I don't remember the order
<Radimir> It went, at least as Twilight is telling Nightmare Moon:
<Lunasta> Meh, I've been having some PCI troubles with my wifi card
<Radimir> Honesty, Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Loyalty, Magic.
<Cracky> I think laughter was last in the book...
<AlphaOmega> that is also the order that they were revieled
<Cracky> NEvermind
<mook> HoKiLaGeLoMa
<AlphaOmega> I think
<VariableRadius> It's a shiney Applejack!
<Cracky> AlphaOmega, what timezone are you in, do you ever sleep?
<Efreet> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ5JgkXlfV8&feature=watch_response
*VariableRadius readies his appleball!
<AlphaOmega> I do sleep yes
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about The Strange Rainbow Dash
<Efreet> I'm scared.
<AlphaOmega> sometimes but I often suffer from imsomnia
*VariableRadius throws the appleball at the shiny Applejack!
<Cracky> Yeah...
<AlphaOmega> but I am on Central Standard time
<Cracky> O
<Gilda> Well anyway, this place hasn't been, like, TOO insufferable today. But I gotta fly.
<Radimir> I love those 'The Strange X' videos.
<Efreet> I'm scared Radimir.
<Cracky> So its like, 6am?
<Efreet> Hold me.
<Gilda> Out.
*Radimir holds Efreet.
*Efreet clutches Radimir tightly
<AlphaOmega> nope its 9 PM
*Radimir snuggles Efreet gently.
<Cracky> Lies
<Lunasta> Central Euro time?
<Radimir> Australian time.
<Lunasta> Cause that's not NAmerican Central
<Radimir> AEST.
<Cracky> Its all secrets and lies with you...
<AlphaOmega> I am in South Aust, so its Central Standard Time
<Lunasta> Too many Central Standard Times.
<Larscis> AUCST and USCST and Ferrari CST...
<Lunasta> lol Ferrari CST
<Cracky> Not very standard if you ask me
<Efreet> Why can't I hold all these ponies?
<VariableRadius> Understand! Understand! The conept of Frienship!
<Cracky> I am in PST
<AlphaOmega> not daylight savings there?
<Cracky> To the moon with daylight savings!
<Larscis> AlphaOmega: I have no daylight savings here
<VariableRadius> The moon to meet the stars
<Lunasta> DST is a waste of time.
<AlphaOmega> we recently changed our DST dates, now its 6 months on and off
<Efreet> WA doesn't have DST
<Efreet> yay
<AlphaOmega> nor does QLD
<Lunasta> The only people who would need the time change would be farmers, and even then there are atomic clocks and lights to keep the dark away.
<AlphaOmega> its funny SA ends up 30mins ahead of QLD
<Cracky> Even farmers could just do a special trick called "getting up earlier"
<Efreet> wait..
<Efreet> ..
<Efreet> SA ends up AHEAD of QLD?
<Efreet> LOL
<Radimir> I thought that WA did have DST?
<Efreet> We don't.
<Radimir> I think QLD is the only state without it.
<Cracky> Are you all in Australia?
*Shaico yawns.
<Larscis> Radimir: Neither AZ nor HI have DST
<Radimir> I meant Australian states.
<Efreet> http://wa.gov.au/daylightsaving/
<Sharksky> Queensland
<FF|Sleep> Okay, off to go do a ropes course that's a mandatory part of orientation.
<Radimir> The worst and best state.
<Larscis> Though seeing as how the VP is such a VIP, shoudn't we keep the PC on the QT? 'Cause if it leaks to the VC he could end up MIA and then we'd all be put on KP.
<Efreet> por que
<Radimir> The VP is useless.

<MrPoniator> I burn games for my PS2 only to use 'em as backups to preserve the original discs
<VariableRadius> Sonic Shuffle was basicly the Hard Strategy version of Mario Party

<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about artist:madmax mma rainbow_dash madmax pinkie_pie
<Dermathil> btw, don't forget those are the extended editions of the trilogy
<DesertRose> worst description ever
<MeteorVenture> i like that not many people are running through the house at night and also my brother has some computer time during the day so i would have to wait through it if i was awake during that half of the day
<Colgate> aww, no makes
<MeteorVenture> and i like the nighttime lol
<RainBroDash> 10That makes sense. I have the same reasoning, but for staying up atrociously late most nights :p
<RainBroDash> 10I like the night. It's peaceful, tranquil. Plus there's nobody around to get in the way ;)
<MeteorVenture> ya i don't have a job yet and nowhere to really be so i can sleep whenever (inb4 b& for bragging)
<RainBroDash> 10xD
*RainBroDash 10is in the same position until he starts uni on 24th semptember
<RainBroDash> 10also, I can't spell
<MeteorVenture> uni..corn
<MeteorVenture> you become a unicorn on the 24th of september
<RainBroDash> 10oh god
<Sharksky> Cakes.
<RainBroDash> 10I'm going to be a unicorn
<RainBroDash> 10I wanted to be a pegasus pony
<RainBroDash> 10God, y u do dis
<MeteorVenture> why else do you think it costs so much?
<RainBroDash> 10damn straight
<Daz> RainBroDash is a pegasus already
<RainBroDash> 10aww yeaah
<Daz> http://i.imgur.com/kOzrL.png
<Daz> oui?
<RainBroDash> 10for now :3
<Daz> for now?
<MeteorVenture> i got an idea.. maybe if you pay for unicorn and pegasus you can be an alicorn.. it's debateable whether you need to play for earth pony as well
<Daz> lawl
<RainBroDash> 10fund it :P
<MeteorVenture> if i was that rich i would have a more magical computer
<Daz> hey what about being a unicorn but having a really really good ability for the wings spell? win, amirite?
<RainBroDash> 10meh, would still rather be a pegasus :p
<Colgate|DS> pies?
<Dermathil> I'm pretty sure the size of an alicorn is supposed to represent an earth pony's strength. Otherwise it would only serve to represent earth ponies as inferior to the other races
<Daz> hmm...well i think i'll be a unicorn when i make mine
<DerpyBot> muffins!
<MeteorVenture> i was happy and slightly surprised when lauren explained earth ponies in the same way that i was already thinking they were
<Daz> what was her explanation?
<MeteorVenture> i'm not sure whether she said any of this as a sure thing or as "i like to think of it like this" sort of thing.. but i'm pretty sure she basically said that they have a special connection with the earth
<Dermathil> yeah, they are much more physically stong than Unicorns and Pegasi
<Daz> ah i remember that now! yea i loved that explanation
<Daz> really makes RD look even more of an athlete, if she keeps up with AJ, like, one of the strongest earth ponies :3
*RainBroDash 10isn't too fussed for explanations, just likes the ponies :3
<MeteorVenture> well AJ probably doesn't do that sort of training
<SillyNilly|Sketch> !link
<DerpyBot> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10906236/Pony/Temp/fluttershy_dreamy.jpg
<MeteorVenture> she is strong but maybe not as swift
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Wonderful.
<Efreet> Y'know what I need?
<Efreet> Well.
<Efreet> What I want?
<Efreet> an awesome mod compilation for oblivion.
<Efreet> :<
<mbulu> 404'd :(
<DesertRose> derpy 404'd
<Efreet> !link
<DerpyBot> https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Impulse_Tracker
<HaysforPonies> Derpy you so derpy.
<Efreet> wat?
<Efreet> !link
<DerpyBot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z0nQcC9cPI - Twilight Uncensored [FIXED]
<MeteorVenture> also it's an oddity of sorts that fluttershy being a pegasus would have the abilities or hobbies or connection to the animals or whatever that she does.. i can't remember what was said exactly.. just that fluttershy did more earth pony-like things and that it was unusual
<MeteorVenture> but that makes sense cause she was going to be an earth pony and pinkie pie be a pegasus so themoreyouknow.jpg
<MeteorVenture> so i guess they might have had these ideas from the beginning
<Daz> i knew that, but i still cna't imagine pinkie as a pegasus i mean:
<Dermathil> I do imagine her as a pegasus actually.
<Daz> I MEAN DUDE WTF SHE'S EASILY THE FASTEST PONY WITH THE MOST ENDURANCE, but doesn't brag about it, AND DUDE YOU WANNA GIVE HER WINGS TOOOOOO??????
<Daz> Dermathil wat. her as a pegasus would make the universe implode
<Dermathil> EEEEEYUP
<Dermathil> exactly
<MeteorVenture> lol that's my thoughts exactly.. well pretty much anyway
<Daz> :P
<MeteorVenture> even RD couldn't run from her
<MeteorVenture> effectively anyway
<Daz> ikr, now give her wings? D:
<Leonon> that is beautiful
<Daz> there's a comic where she goes supersaiyan to gain wings some where lol
<AllisZero> Yeah, Pinkie can teleport better than Twilight
<VariableRadius> Twilight cursing is the best cursing
<MeteorVenture> she would do a rainboom (or whatever her version of it is) every other flight session
<Daz> ^ this this so much this!
<Daz> and that too MeteorVenture
<HotCocoa> Who's talking about Impulse Tracker?
<Daz> :3
<AllisZero> Oh I saw that one
<Efreet> I did a random link
<AllisZero> But we already know Pinkie's other side, so I don't think she can go super saiyan
<HotCocoa> Oh.
<MeteorVenture> lol i didn't think that was a reply to me cause of how fast you said it:P
<Daz> you're also 100% right though haha
<Dermathil> Alright, leaving.
<MeteorVenture> lol well you saw the comic with the mythbusters.. she drank the coffee
<MeteorVenture> didn't even need wings to make a huge explosion
<MeteorVenture> take care dermathil:D
<Daz> bai Dermathil
<Salamander> SO!
<Daz> haha loved taht comic too
<Leonon> so?
<Salamander> Among my friends, its sort of a running joke that we change Tony's netbook's desktop wallpaper to something pony related every time he leaves it unattended
<Efreet> right.
<Salamander> (even if he locks it, I know his password, he's too lazy to change it)
<Efreet> we know who tony is.
<Daz> wtf how is a 720p movie of 2 hours only 500MB? myheadisfullofapples
<Efreet> he's the guy you know.
<Salamander> yes, he's a friend, thats all thats important
<Salamander> this time, I decided to be somewhat cruel
<AllisZero> Bad encode probably
<Efreet> can't leave out important details.
<Daz> i think so
<Daz> gonna test it out ... now :P
<MeteorVenture> ya.. they eventually noticed the talking ponies.. and at the beginning i was surprised rarity was smiling with whatever that thing is called that was on her head.. a muzzle?
<Salamander> since his netbook runs linux, I edited his bashrc file so that it resets his desktop wallpaper to rarity every time he opens a terminal
<Daz> yea it ain't great...still, it's very watchable for 500 mb :3
<Daz> will view later
<Salamander> Every. Single. Time.
<AllisZero> what movie is it?
<Daz> Pitch Black. haven't seen it.
<Daz> (Vin Diesel as 'Riddick')
<Daz> prequel to the better known Chronicles of Riddick, which I love
<Salamander> he was paranoid about me having altered anything else for the rest of the day
<Shaico> ...woah
<Shaico> DASHIE
<Shaico> Ah screw it.
<Shaico> You aren't gonna answer meh.
<Dashie> I AM
<Dashie> O HAI
<AllisZero> Ah, gotcha
<MeteorVenture> never saw that myself
<MeteorVenture> i mean any of it
<Mehal> somebody type !moon
<SouthernCross> !moon Mehal
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, SouthernCross!
<Efreet> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkN4EbJM7LM&NR=1
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Applejack&#39;s Bad Day.
<Salamander> owned
<Efreet> i'm scared of that video.
*SouthernCross returns with an assload of moon rocks
<Efreet> Moonrocks?
<Barry> Hi, Daz
<Efreet> I'll buy some moonrocks. I need them to make some combustible lemons.
<Barry> Hi MeteorVenture, hi AllisZero
<SouthernCross> no, they are mine! For SCIENCE!!
<Efreet> Screw you man.
<Efreet> I'm typing like a BR at times because I'm so tired.
<Efreet> :C
<Efreet> I asked someone
<Efreet> Why Rarity is always spy?
<Daz> Hey Barry !
<Sharksky> I never really was on your side.
<User_4435> Rarity would be awesome as a Spy
<MeteorVenture> yo barry
<User_4435> cmon....Rarity as James Bond ;D
<Efreet> ..
<User_4435> ooh yeah...''smells the epicness''
<SouthernCross> ...
<User_4435> ;P just sayian
<Efreet> ......
<Efreet> NOPE.
<User_4435> Nope.Avi or just nope?
<User_4435> :P
<Efreet> just nope.
<Efreet> you don't deserve nope.avi.
<User_4435> hahahaha(wait what?)
<Leonon> now I want to watch Drawn Together and replace MLP's audio with it
<User_4435> So let's see...AJ is on top 6 while Rarity is on top 5....
<Efreet> Hahahaha.. Yeah.. Yeah.. Wait.. what?
<User_4435> Who's the most favorite pony atm?
<Efreet> "I mean, who wants to be known as the girl who's had 7 abortions?"
<Efreet> "Yeah.. wait.. what?"
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie is <3
<User_4435> Heh...really...thought it was Fluttershy ;)
<eXAKR> Pinkie Pie is awesome
<eXAKR> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sV5eNEK1mME/TldWS9P9M2I/AAAAAAAALBk/2YnqlvQmY48/s1600/081411____mlp_fim_cupcakes_by_dahli_lama-d46l0va.jpg
<eXAKR> Suddenly, cupcakes.
<Efreet> I want those cupcakes.
<Efreet> Rainbow Dash's looks awesome. But I'd love to eat Pinkie Pie's.
<Efreet> ..
<MeteorVenture> you know.. when season 1 ended i planned on taking a decent break or at least a big step back to do some other things so it's all fresh again when season 2 arrived.. but i got very little done.. still some though
<SouthernCross> what? no Luna cupcake....
<Efreet> She escap- I should stop myself there.
*SouthernCross graps his Luna Republic flag and pitchfork... it's time for someone to feel the wrath of the Republic...
<MeteorVenture> also i planned on getting a job so i could watch ponies in high quality on a really nice monitor with no lag whatsoever.. eh still working on it though
<Daz> Although I'll admint my life is pretty pony right now, i'll still say this: There's a lot more to life than Ponies
<MeteorVenture> ya i know lol.. i was gonna use that computer for quite alot of other things as well
<Daz> :3
<Untamed> Well, I'm off to bed
<Untamed> night everypony
<Untamed> !lullaby
*DerpyBot carries Untamed off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks Untamed in and hums a lullaby
<MeteorVenture> like recording and playing video games in super awesome quality with more importantly.. no lag whatsoever
<Untamed> <3
<AllisZero> Hey Barry
<AllisZero> Sorry, had a guy from our fiber company
*Untamed sleeps easily with Derpy's lullaby
<MeteorVenture> but other than the computer it's nice to have some income for anything else as well
<Daz> sure is
<MeteorVenture> i plan on making video games and i'm sure that's pretty expensive
<MeteorVenture> not that i can code for anything right now.. i'm still working on step 1
<AllisZero> Passion is the first step!
<Daz> sure is!
<Daz> in everything you ever do!
<MeteorVenture> haha ok then i'm still working on step 2:P and still partly step 1
<AllisZero> Yaaay~
<FluffyWuffs> ?
<FluffyWuffs> its quiet here...
<FluffyWuffs> o.o
<AlphaOmega> yes
<AlphaOmega> yes it is
<Sharksky> No, not really.
<MrPoniator> I r back
*RainBroDash 10can't do anything yet
<MeteorVenture> which brings me to wonder.. if you don't have passion how do you go about getting it? or if you do then how do you increase it?
<Daz> you might hear someone say you don't, you find it. I'm here to tell you that you do bot.
<Daz> Thats right, you find it AND you make it yourself. Just like the CMC's, try loads of stuff till you like one of them, then keep doing that one thing
<RainBroDash> 10All I've found so far is that the only time I get inspired to do anything long-term, it's by pure random chance
<Colgate|DS> *crickets*
<MeteorVenture> i think most things are things you can work on in one way or another.. things aren't nearly as set in stone as people say they are
<Sharksky> So who wants some delicious cupcakes?
<MeteorVenture> but i still think there are things set in stone
<Colgate|DS> me!
<RainBroDash> 10meh
<Daz> oh god,only idiots think anyones life is ever 'set in stone'
<Efreet> I would like some pie.
<Daz> sure some things
<Daz> but 'your hwole life' ? No, mate, it's really not
<Mehal0> !lullaby
*DerpyBot carries Mehal0 off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks Mehal0 in and hums a lullaby
<DesertRose> o.0
<PhotoFinish> I, PhotoFinish,
<PhotoFinish> have arrived.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Um
<DesertRose> so?
<Sharksky> Awwwyeah, PhotoFinish.
<Mehal0> !sun
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Yay?
*VariableRadius takes pictures
<MeteorVenture> ya definitely not.. those are excuses
<VariableRadius> Celebraties!
<GGgala> wait... what would be set in stone even?
<Daz> for those who didn't do anything or get anywhere
<PhotoFinish> Danke, danke schon, ENOUGH.
<Daz> GGgala: 'your exam results decide your LIFE' 'now ure at uni your LIFE is set in stone' 'now u got the job your LIFe is set in stnoe'
<RainBroDash> 10GGgala, things like impotency
<GGgala> RainBroDash: lawl
<MeteorVenture> lol
<RainBroDash> 10well it's true :P
<MeteorVenture> maybe
<RainBroDash> 10or fine, maybe sterility
<GGgala> not with HORNZYTE, the natural unicorn enhancement
<RainBroDash> 10better example
<RainBroDash> 10and lol
<AllisZero> From experience I can tell you that if you don't have passion, you have to make up for it with determination
<RainBroDash> 10that's a super lot of effort, determination without passion
<RainBroDash> 10I'll just turn over and go back to sleep kthx :3
<AllisZero> You can't do anything of your life without one or the other, but having both passion and determination will get you far.
<MeteorVenture> i think sometimes if you just do it then it can turn into a passion
<AllisZero> Yep, but there are people like that you know, and it's commendable in my opinion
<GGgala> also Daz: ahhh i see what you mean thar
<asexylady> !lullaby
*DerpyBot carries asexylady off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks asexylady in and hums a lullaby
<PhotoFinish> I haf killed this chat.
<asexylady> lol @ durpybot
*VariableRadius floats like a butterfly
<MeteorVenture> really depends on if you believe in what you're doing though
<Efreet> "The dead aliens are still dead. And still aliens, but that-.. god damn it I'm too tired to quote RvB properly.
*VariableRadius is level one. Needs level ups
<AllisZero> To me passion has more to do with the emotional kick of accomplishing something, of loving something for what it's worth. Determination is, on the other hand, the logical knowledge of what you do and the goal you want to achieve
<Efreet> "Washington used to wet the bed! *laugh* I'm going to go tell the guys"
<RainBroDash> 10I'm very passionate about my naptimes
<VariableRadius> HOHOHO
<MeteorVenture> rest is important
<MeteorVenture> people should do it more
<MeteorVenture> *looks at half of the chat*
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<MeteorVenture> i'm pretty sure that when i'm really tired i'm getting almost nothing good done and it would be so much more beneficial to go to sleep and use the extra time to do something when i'm awake
<MeteorVenture> and if you have work to do that applies even more
<SillyNilly|Sketch> !link drunk
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/36967
<MeteorVenture> now let's all take a huge nap before the stream
<SillyNilly|Sketch> ^How I feel right now
<AllisZero> Sometimes you need to choose between getting rest and doing what you love
<MeteorVenture> that way our jokes are funny to people other than us during the stream
<MeteorVenture> well sometimes perhaps but it's probably usually not that way
<VioletVanilla> RainBroDaaaassssshhhh~~~~ :3
<Efreet> night gaiz
<SillyNilly|Sketch> Goodight Efreet
<RainBroDash> 10Violet :D How is youu this fine day~?

<AllisZero> Pretty alright ValtheJean
<SirSprinkles> Since he's... just now here. XD
<MeteorVenture> we were essentially talking about the finer points of a career
<ValtheJean> oh?
<ValtheJean> that sounds titilating!
<RainBroDash> He knows he was informed at the end of the interview
<SirSprinkles> k
<RainBroDash> he's keeping it quiet i think
<RainBroDash> until BMN
<MeteorVenture> nope not really :|
<ValtheJean> I have....THE POWAAHHHHHHH
*ValtheJean feels special
<SirSprinkles> I just gave him HOP, since I have to be going before BMN starts.
<RainBroDash> eh
<RainBroDash> well idk, maybe it's best left until later
<RainBroDash> ?
<SirSprinkles> Because it TOTALLY matters... it's not like it's today or anything.
<MeteorVenture> i'm jk it was kinda
<RainBroDash> nah I think people were maybe going to leave it until next week
<RainBroDash> that's all
<Daz> somanynewmods myheadisfullofapples
<ValtheJean> oh sure, you just don't want to talk about it because I got here :P

<MeteorVenture> ah actually someone recommended that i listen to that before steven
<Daz> so you have heard this song then?
<MeteorVenture> err.. daz rather i guess lol.. i don't understand IRC sometimes
*Daz isn't Steven :P
<MeteorVenture> ya i have:D i asked for the weirdest music someone could find
<Daz> oh you wanted weirdest msuci?
<Daz> well, again, i have about 100 odd songs that are very 'weird' but i could link one :P
<Daz> i urge you to ask others though aswell
<MeteorVenture> anyway the reason i was asking is cause of what you were saying earlier about passion and stuff (saying this doesn't help the fanfic idea) so anyway i just took you for the type to like lots of music
<MeteorVenture> or at least good music of a variety of sorts
<MeteorVenture> anyway no i wasn't asking for weird music lol.. just music you personally liked alot
<Daz> i sure do, but I don't see how that implied I liked music lol
<Daz> songs I like a lot?
<Daz> well here's one I love to bits
<MeteorVenture> i don't expect you to give me music based on what i like cause you don't know what i like lol.. but i like alot of different types of music

<AllisZero> Err...
<AllisZero> Omae no XXX de Ten wo Tsuke actually
<AllisZero> How did I fuck up the song name that much
<Daz> there's english version, but i prefer spanish. besides, it's awesomely dubbed by a Spanish singer, so it's alos it's own song :3
<MeteorVenture> i don't understand spanish but hey if it flows well it's all good:D
<MeteorVenture> i actually watched treasure planet a while ago on a synchtube
<Daz> nice
<Daz> quality of vid is awful, but eh
<Daz> i got another song lined up for when this is over

<Daz> MeteorVenture imo 1 is way better. actually all 3 are good, but i just played 1 first. also AllisZero that's such a good theme, why hadn't i heard it before? :P
<MeteorVenture> ya this is really chill
<Daz> and fim opening there too :
<Daz> cannot WAIT for slightly different FiM s02 theme!

<Daz> "I remember when this was a game. Where did I loose it. I'm so ashamed. We lost the touch somewhere on this ride. You're better than us. You're the old school pride. Always competing you never relax. If we make ten then you make eleven tracks. I'm wondering can't you have some fun. If I'm just walking why do you have to run."
<Daz> "When we started it was supposed to be fun. It lasted for three good years in the sun. Business came in and took over the lead. That is where you came together with greed. We don't really care about what you do. If you make a record real good. Then lucky you. But now I see panic in your eyes. You better slow down my friend. OK let me help you take my hand."
<Daz> "You spit in my hand. You spit on me. So sad to see this makes me sick."

<RobotPinkie> don't worry, Daz, I don't look down on you for not having Dash :P

<Galadriel> 7make your choice
<MeteorVenture> i think i REALLY should have found a better video
<Daz> and i had the first 5 movies too...strange. it isn't bringing nostalgia
<ValtheWizard> Galadriel, she is a demi-god after all :P
<AlphaOmega> the funny thing is, besides the Magic... the 5 elements of harmony are also taught as a masonic thing
<Daz> gala?

<PeanutButterWolf> oh, Loud Kiddington
<Crainy> read this:
<Crainy> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36608473.html
<Crainy> instructions can be found below in the thread
<Lawdee> Awww, but they're soo kyuuute

<Daz> Violin solo!!! :3
<Crainy> it will help, too
<Tenaris> that was slightly unnecessary
<FluffyWuffs> I
<FluffyWuffs> love
<FluffyWuffs> cats
<FluffyWuffs> >.>
<Tenaris> oops wrong post xD;
<PeanutButterWolf> ;-; The last of the Amblin Entertainment cartoons of the 90s
<RobotPinkie> I've been to Gettysburg... it was interesting
<FluffyWuffs> Hairballs? To solve that problem, include flax seed oil to their diet
<JackiePie> I think the problem that is that they want you to vote in a German forum
<Nuclear> PONIES!
<JackiePie> A language most ponies do not know of
<DeadBarney> Crainy: the link in the 6th part is the same as the one in the 5th (the image)
<MeteorVenture> that whole solo or whatnot is AMAZING
<Daz> MeteorVenture: before anything, 'im now listening to this. IT'S SO GOOD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwERapuM17k&feature=player_embedded

<Lawdee> I accidentally taught my cat a trick
<PeanutButterWolf> luna
<JackiePie> What trick is that
*Galadriel 11nods
<Lawdee> She falls over when I blow at her
<Ghosties> 4I've heard that kid's voice somewhere
<JackiePie> aww cute
<Crainy> ups
<Lawdee> :3
<Crainy> well
<FluffyWuffs> lol
<Crainy> doesnt matter
<Crainy> we wont win
<Nuclear> D'awwwwwwwwwwwww
<Lawdee> That, or shes really a pushover
<FluffyWuffs> I usually don't prefer female cats
<DeadBarney> But, but :'(
<FluffyWuffs> most of them are bi*ches...
<FluffyWuffs> male cats are more awesome
<Lawdee> Not if you have my cats
<DeadBarney> (and the last link is not valid)
<Ghosties> 4Oh, he sounds like the kid from Up!
<Lawdee> I have a he and a she though
<FluffyWuffs> how many cats you got?
<ValtheWizard> he might just be the same VA
<FluffyWuffs> i jus got one :c
<MeteorVenture> i got a few theories about music and stuff
<SouthernCross> crazy cat people
<PeanutButterWolf> doubt it since they're both voiced by boys
<Lawdee> Cats are cuuute
<FluffyWuffs> real mean love cats
<ValtheWizard> are they?
<FluffyWuffs> and ponies!
<SouthernCross> birds are better
<FluffyWuffs> But, I love any animal really
<ValtheWizard> sometimes boy parts are just ladies who are very talented
<Nuclear> Uh
<Lawdee> Dogs are boring when they are old
<Daz> guise can anyone lend me a ha-a hoof with this? I'm trying to be completely uptodate with 'pony music archive 1.5' but don't get what I'm supposed to d/l
<FluffyWuffs> I use to raise dogs ;]
<FluffyWuffs> but where I'm currently living, I can't own a dog
<HolyJunkie> Howdy-doo.
<FluffyWuffs> apartment rules :c
<FluffyWuffs> heya Junkie
<ValtheWizard> you want who to put a thing in the what now?
<SouthernCross> especially Budgerigars
<Lawdee> G'day
<PeanutButterWolf> Most women voicing boys sound weird like Bart Simpson. or Phil from Rugrats
<SouthernCross> they can be old as dirt and still be energetic as a small child
<RobotPinkie> PHEW, Pinkie finally done
<MeteorVenture> this is amazing though o.o
<RobotPinkie> just need to dry now
<Daz> pics RobotPinkie ?
<Wrek> Im not american and what is this...
<Daz> oh it's dryig :3
<Daz> drying *
<RobotPinkie> I'll take pics when it's dry, I don't have hairdryer though =C
<MeteorVenture> what's america? this is equestrian
<FluffyWuffs> Birds
<RobotPinkie> I'll let it stand in front a low energy light bulb for a couple of hours :P
<FluffyWuffs> I use to have finches
<Ghosties> 4Boo, the South lost *thumbs down*
<ValtheWizard> lol
<Lawdee> Archimedes, noooo
<FluffyWuffs> They were reproducing like crazy...
<MeteorVenture> woah ghosties.. i haven't got that far on north and south yet
<FluffyWuffs> I had to give like, 20 away...
<FluffyWuffs> XD
<SouthernCross> I used to breed finches, canaries and quails
<FluffyWuffs> nice
<DeadBarney> I don't have any pet :(
<RobotPinkie> lol I probably should've done the front of the mane last, I just realized...
<SouthernCross> started with 8 birds total
<Lawdee> Forever alone
<RobotPinkie> ah well...
<MeteorVenture> jk i have
<Lawdee> No wait, that's me
<SouthernCross> when we had 40 we desided maybe breeding them wasn't the best idea
<DeadBarney> I only help to take care of some ponies at a friends' farm on summer holidays
<ValtheWizard> that baby scares me
<ValtheWizard> it's larger than the children!
<DeadBarney> But I don't really like real-life ponies
<Ghosties> 4FUCK YEAH, VIKINGS
<Wrek> 5^
<Ghosties> 4YINGER HINGER DINGER
*RobotPinkie pillages and burns
<ValtheWizard> lol
<ValtheWizard> BY ODIN...I MEAN CELESTIA'S BEARD!
<Wrek> 5RAPE N PILLAGE RAPE N PILLAGE
<Daz> apparently vikings used horsepiss to style their hair into spikes, as it would hold. RobotPinkie The more you know xD
<RobotPinkie> YAY!
<Ghosties> 4Vikings were like the original gangbangers
<Lawdee> I think rl horses would be really harts too take care of
<RobotPinkie> wow Daz :P
<Ghosties> 4They didn't give a fuck
<MeteorVenture> i never saw this as a kid btw
<SouthernCross> mind you that was after they each had one clutch of eggs
<Daz> lol
<RobotPinkie> Well, maybe next time I style a pony
<Riders> Well this is a blast from the past.
<FluffyWuffs> gah, 40!?
<User_5089> hello everypony! ^^
<FluffyWuffs> thats a lot
<MeteorVenture> i can tell that this is OLD lol
<FluffyWuffs> hey there User_{numbers here}
<RobotPinkie> wow
<ValtheWizard> I wonder if there's any way to steal more bandwidth so I don't have to keep pressing play every minute
<MeteorVenture> at least old for me
<SouthernCross> yeah... they weren't wanting for food
<DeadBarney> Lawdee: the smell, the smell !
<FluffyWuffs> o hai firelight!
<Riders> MeteorVenture = Only about 8 or 9 years old.
<Wrek> 5what is this faggotry
<DeadBarney> hi firelight
<PeanutButterWolf> Yep, the voice of Loud Kiddington was some producer's kid.
<MeteorVenture> well ya that's old for me lol.. i'm only 19:P
<RobotPinkie> That's more of a German accent....
<Riders> And I'm 20, your point :P
<Wrek> 5mfw greenland flashed aswell when they said island
<ValtheWizard> I was thinking Austrian, but yeah
<Wrek> 5iceland*
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah, Leif Ericsson had already been to North America before the natives and Columbus
<RobotPinkie> Leif Ericson was Icelandic...
<DeadBarney> The friend i was talking about really reminds me of applejack
<RobotPinkie> He should sing a Bjork song instead
<MeteorVenture> haha this song is awesome
<Ghosties> 4I can't watch this
<Ghosties> 4It's getting me more and more pumped for Skyrim
<RobotPinkie> I can't clop to this :(
<Lawdee> Thank celestia for having this happy place full of ponies
<ValtheWizard> lol
<ValtheWizard> inb4 NOS FU DAAAAAAAAAAA
<FluffyWuffs> amen
<Riders> Things I learned this summer: I love Bethesda RPGs but suck at them
<Ghosties> 4Why do you suck at them/
<Ghosties> 4*?
<RobotPinkie> NOSWAITH DDA, VAL
<ValtheWizard> you can set the difficulty lower Riders
<MeteorVenture> was i the only one pretty disappointed with oblivion?
<RobotPinkie> oh wait...
<PeanutButterWolf> mew
<ValtheWizard> MeteroVenture: Eeenope
<ValtheWizard> meteor* even
<Wrek> 5Im sorry, but this is insulting
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, if it's difficulty, then you can just turn it down
<Wrek> 5*pauses stream*
<Riders> I freely admit that they're way over my head. Too much micro-managing to keep track of if you want to get really good.
<ValtheWizard> all in favor of Shivering Isles being the greatest expansion ever?
<MeteorVenture> lol "even".. is that a reference to snagglepuss?
<RobotPinkie> >implying the previous episode wasn't :P
<ValtheWizard> well the nice thing about it Riders is that if you don't want to worry about it you don't have to. You can set the difficulty lower and just do whatever you feel like
<PeanutButterWolf> At least you get an episode. Where's Africa?
<Riders> I'm not bagging on it. I'm glad someone is willing to make RPGs that hardcore. But I've been playing their games since Morrowind and it can take me years just to be able to survive
<Ghosties> 4Ahhh, Morrowind
<MeteorVenture> but the thing is the difficulty is REALLY annoying at the same time.. there's no strong monsters.. as you get better so do the enemies and if you have it on a high difficulty they get better faster than you do so you have a better chance at level 1
<MeteorVenture> and when i say no strong monsters i mean not that i have seen.. i kinda quit mid-game for a while
<Ghosties> 4BINGO
<ValtheWizard> all the difficulty changes is the health and damage they do
<Ghosties> 4HAHA
<Galadriel> 11SUPRISE!
<MrPoniator> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=ZAqGs441qzU This game can't come any sooner, can it? ;-;
<ValtheWizard> not the actual items or anything
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Extreme Escape Adventure: Good People Die (999 Sequel) - Trailer [3DS/Vita] [Subbed]
<Ghosties> 4"Surprise! : D"
<Ghosties> 4"Take his stuff!!!"
<Wrek> 5*dang*
<Daz> Galadriel: you having blue text for LOTR as well?
<Riders> I've never been handed my ass so many times as a level 1 character before I played Fallout 3
<Ghosties> 4What a bunch of dicks XD
<ValtheWizard> lol
<Galadriel> 11I might do, not sure yet
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow, Fallout 3, yeah
<firelight> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/50009 ... i'm tired too to see so much images of Rarity being pull by her horn
<Wrek> 5fallout:NV ruined F:3 for me
<Wrek> 5i,e hardcore mode
<MeteorVenture> i had the game on max difficulty from the beginning and my and my brothers had little problem progressing through half the game.. i even beat what was probably one of the hardest challenges in the game on that difficulty
<Wrek> 5<3
<RobotPinkie> I'm so glad they returned to slightly more hardcore difficulty
<Riders> Obsidian ruined an RPG. What else is new?
<Ghosties> 4Fallout 3 isn't bad at all
<MeteorVenture> i mean on oblivion
<RobotPinkie> lol I'm looking forward to playing New Vegas
<Ghosties> 4It's New Vegas that you gotta worry about
<RobotPinkie> I'm waiting for the GotY edition :P
<ValtheWizard> bah...I give up! I can't watch the streams with this connection! *rageface*
<Ghosties> 4Since the original team took back NV, they *really* buffed Deathclaws
<Riders> But New Vegas was Obsidian, not Bethesda.
<RobotPinkie> Nice
<ValtheWizard> Obsidian....grrrrr.
<Ghosties> 4But it was the same team
<RobotPinkie> They were a bit too easy in Fallout 3, though... you could meet them very early on
<ValtheWizard> Obsidian ruined potentially the greatest series ever
<Riders> Bethesda is infamous for being the kiss of death for franchises
<Ghosties> 4All of the original team members (as far as I can recall) made NV
<Riders> Obsidian, my bad
<RobotPinkie> Yeah Obsidian is made up from a lot of old Falloiut people
<Dashite> Ghosties, nope.
<RobotPinkie> from Fallout 1 and 2
<Ghosties> 4Yes, Dashite
<Ghosties> 4Right, from Fallout 1 and 2
<Ghosties> 4Those guys made NV
<Dashite> Obsidian has a lot of people from Black Isle, but there are a lot of people that aren't there.
<RobotPinkie> Obsidian was created by Black Isle members after they got fired by Interplay
<Riders> I can see why they were fired
<ValtheWizard> lol
<MeteorVenture> oblivion would have been so much better imo if it didn't have a set difficulty
<ValtheWizard> god damn Obsidian....ruining KotOR
<Ghosties> 4All I know is, if you're a low level character and you come across a Deathclaw, you are fucked
<ValtheWizard> MeteorVenture: you mean an adjustable difficulty?>
<RobotPinkie> Only thing bad about KotOR 2 was that the publisher forced them to rush it out...
<Dashite> KotOR 2 > KotOR 1 (minus the ending, that was pretty shitty)
<RobotPinkie> So many bugs
<Ghosties> 4And if you're high level and have excellent equipment, you're still fucked if there's more than one Deathclaw
<ValtheWizard> KotOR 2 was so terrible Dashite!
<Dashite> Nope
<MeteorVenture> no i mean a set difficulty.. as you get better so do the enemies so it's pretty set
<Riders> All I'm saying, KotOR 2, NWN 2, Dungeon Siege 3; I see a pattern
<ValtheWizard> It wasn't until fanmade mods/patches that it was actually PLAYABLE
<Ghosties> 4I prefer KOTOR 2 over the first one
<Daz> >8,610 RD chrome theme useres. >495 Twilight Chrome theme users.
<RobotPinkie> I liked KotOR 2, but it needed about 6 more months in development
<Dashite> It was playable on release, it just had a shitty ending cause half of it was missing.
<Riders> And stop trollin Dashite, KotOR 2 was terrible
<ValtheWizard> KotOR 2 had the POTENTIAL to be amazing
<ValtheWizard> which is why I'm glad Team Gizka finally finished the TRP
<Dashite> Not trolling at all. KotOR 2 story beat the shit out of KotOR 1.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, yeah, "KOTOR1 was amazing and wonderful and great" blah blah blah
<Ghosties> 4I get it
<Ghosties> 4I enjoyed the game too
<ValtheWizard> ....
<Ghosties> 4But I'm just saying that I prefer KOTOR2
<MeteorVenture> maybe that's cause all the RD fans use chrome and all the twilight fans use firefox
<firelight> so... anypony want to see a video ? :3
<Dashite> Did Team Gizka ever actually release their version? Last I heard someone else released a competing mod.
<ValtheWizard> yeah, they released it
<ValtheWizard> I haven't played it yet, as it's on my desktop at home
<ValtheWizard> but I'm very eager
<RobotPinkie> not Obsidian's fault, though... They were under contract and had to push it out
<Riders> Glitchy to the max, Boring intro, non-existent ending, boring characters, weak enemies
<RobotPinkie> They had to cut over a whole fucking planet from the game...
<RobotPinkie> Makes me so pissed off, if only they'd gotten more time to finish.
<ValtheWizard> and yeah, sorry Dashite but the story was just fail. If they had actually FINISHED it, then yes I can see it being better because it had so much potential
<Wrek> 5this is the chain of events with many potentially great games
<Wrek> 5i blame publishers
<Wrek> 5i.e go steam go!
*Ghosties 4wishes KOTOR2 would finally release on Steam
<Riders> RobotPinkie = I would believe that if it weren't for the fact that every game they've released since has had the exact same flaws
<Dashite> Dungeon Siege 3.
<ValtheWizard> well no, there was publisher problems with KotOR II
<MeteorVenture> really.. what is this cartoon about anyway?
<SirSprinkles> 6This chat is now about trains.
<SirSprinkles> 6Discuss.
<Wrek> 5Il ike trains
<Ghosties> 4Fuck trains
<Wrek> 5...
<ValtheWizard> choo choo!
<Ghosties> 4Trains suck
<DesertRose> what kind of video?
<Ghosties> 4Boo
<Synros> hey everypony
<ValtheWizard> chuga chuga chuga chuga CHOO CHOO
<Wrek> 5trains ae 20% cooler than cars
<ValtheWizard> howdy Synros
<SirSprinkles> 6Derailing with trains ftw.
<Dashite> >_>
<RobotPinkie> Well, you can believe what you like, Riders. The big problem is that they don't have enough clout to pull a Blizzard or Valve thing with development times
<Riders> Alpha Protocol, a game that was delayed for polish and still had all of those issues.
<Ghosties> 4I liked Alpha Protocol
<Dashite> I loved the story, but it had some issues.
<Riders> I liked it when it was playable
<Wrek> 5mfw i havent played any of the games you keep mentioning
<Dashite> Wrek, you are a horrible human being and you should feel bad.
<RobotPinkie> lolol I like it too. It has some flaws, but it's one of the most elaborate RPGs of recent years
<Synros> lol Oh hey Wrek.
<ValtheWizard> so long as you've played Deus Ex Wrek, you're fine by me :P
<RandomExtra> Never played it.
<ValtheWizard> lol
<Dashite> :p
<Riders> Has anypony picked up Human Revolution yet
<Purple`Prose> Oh, hey Riders
<Wrek> 5I have
<ValtheWizard> not yet no
<Dashite> My copy arrived yesterday.
<Daz> ¬_¬
<RandomExtra> Nope
<ValtheWizard> I don't have a pc that can run it
<RobotPinkie> Naw, I hear it's great though
<ValtheWizard> well...my desktop prolly can
<Wrek> 5my conclusion so far is GOTY
<ValtheWizard> but that's at home
<Riders> I'm considering renting it tonight.
<Wrek> 5but that will probably change with skyrim
<ValtheWizard> I'm really glad to hear that Wrek
<Wrek> 5thoguh still a great game
<RobotPinkie> Man, I'm really looking forward to Skyrim...
<ValtheWizard> because I was worried the moment I heard SquareEnix was getting a hand on it
<firelight> a pony video ^^.... anyway here it is
<firelight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7k3pubdumw
<RobotPinkie> Can't wait until I get to play it in 2013 when the GotY edition is out!
<ValtheWizard> after ruining Supreme Commander...I will never forgive them
<RobotPinkie> lololol
<Wrek> 5also im never touching another gearbox game
<Riders> I just hope they don't screw over Hitman and Tomb Raider
<Dashite> SupCom2 was... eh...
<MeteorVenture> dat background music
<RobotPinkie> Why, Wrek? Borderlands was pretty good...
<Riders> Hi Purple`Prose
<Dashite> Screw Hitman and Tomb Raider. They have Thief now.
<Wrek> 5boarderlands is the exeption
<RobotPinkie> or are you blaming them from the flaming paper bag of poop on your doorstep what is Duke Nukem Forever?
<ValtheWizard> AHHHHH
<MeteorVenture> really? screw tomb raider?
<Wrek> 5more or less
<ValtheWizard> THOU HAST MENTIONED THE ABOMINATION
<Daz> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112577-Skyrim-Legalizes-Gay-Marriage
<Riders> Hey, Tomb Raider Legend was great
<Wrek> 5i lold
<RobotPinkie> Eh, not much you can do when you're handed a bag of shit and told to clean it up... I don't blame Gearbox for that
<Galadriel> 11show is switched btw
<Galadriel> 11Angry beavers is on
<Wrek> 5enjoyed legend, never played anniversary
<Parchment_Scroll> Nice. A bit heavy on the bloom effects, but nice.
<Wrek> 5or whatever it was named
<Dashite> Never played a Tomb Raider.
<MeteorVenture> lol this stream is picking up feedback
<Galadriel> 11eeeeyup
<RobotPinkie> Anniversary is great
<RandomExtra> I actually kinda like that echo-y effect on the stream.
<RobotPinkie> it's like the original game and Tomb Raider: Legend had a baby
<MeteorVenture> ya imokwiththis
<Wrek> 5looking forward to test rage though
<Wrek> 5seems liek a stable merge of boarderlands and doom
<MeteorVenture> lololol the feedback
<Wrek> 5and stalker
<Wrek> 5and that kinda games
<RobotPinkie> Oh yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing how their megatexture technology works, Wrek
<RobotPinkie> I wub Id
<Wrek> 5me 2
<Wrek> 5i was a huge fan of bungie though
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Vengeful Shadows (http://tinyurl.com/3mjqk9x)
<Wrek> 5but then they went console
<RobotPinkie> Carmack is a fucking genius when it comes to graphics engine development.
<ValtheWizard> Ah
<Wrek> 5and i never forgave them
<ValtheWizard> the good old days of Labrynth
<ValtheWizard> or was it Maze?
<ValtheWizard> I can't remember
<Wrek> 5i still play marathon
<RobotPinkie> I'm... I dunno... luke warm on Bungie
<Wrek> 5ValtheWizard: Pathways into darkness?
<RobotPinkie> I thought Halo 1 & 2 were great, but the 3rd one was way too buggy in single player
<Rodman> Hi guys
<Dashite> Hey Rodman.
<RobotPinkie> My rage when I got a checkpoint three times during the game when the AI drove me off a cliff...
<ValtheWizard> Maybe....it was that really old shooter for the Mac where you were in a maz killing...zombie...cyclops...things
<ValtheWizard> howdy rodman
<Dashite> lol! Nice checkpoint. :D
<RandomExtra> ohai Rodman!
<Dashite> Marathon.
<Wrek> 5(nostalgia rant) i never enjoyed a game so much as when i first played marathon 2. it was my life for half a year
<RobotPinkie> and yeah Marathon series is great, and free now :D
<Rodman> Hi Dashite, hi ValtheJean, hi RandomExtra
<Wrek> 5u jsut hooked Daz up with them
<ValtheWizard> was it marathon? >mfw I can't even remember the games I used to play
<Daz> u?
<Leonon> http://www.amazon.com/Sharkman-~-Super-Swim-Set/dp/B003GOBESY I need to get one of these, because every girl's crazy about a shark dressed man
<Rodman> We stating how much we love MArathon now? COUNT ME IN!
<Riders> I love the first 3 Halos and Reach. I just hope they don't make a habit of anually releasing. I'm looking at you COD
<Wrek> 5ValtheWizard: http://cdn3.spong.com/screen-shot/p/a/pathwaysin61233/_-Pathways-Into-Darkness-Power-Mac-_.jpg
<ValtheWizard> lol, I stopped with the Halo phenominon at 1
<RobotPinkie> http://trilogyrelease.bungie.org/
<ValtheWizard> YES
<ValtheWizard> THAT'S IT!
<Wrek> 5ey RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> And that is seriously badass of Bungie to release them like that
<ValtheWizard> <3's Wrek
<Wrek> 5source.bugnie.org is the way to go
<Wrek> 5bungie*
<Dashite> I... have never played a Halo single player game.
<RobotPinkie> lol oh okay, Wrek
<Rodman> On my part, I hope Gearbox does something to revive the Duke Nukem series and avoid another DNF
<ValtheWizard> the first one was okay, and I can tolerate it as the first modern shooter
<RobotPinkie> I just use custom repositories, never had to download from Bungie :P
<ValtheWizard> but the other games have nothing to which I can respect
<Wrek> 5RobotPinkie: im not counting on it
<Rodman> Why's that Valthe?
<Dashite> Rodman, I wouldn't be too worried about that.
<RobotPinkie> not counting on what, Wrek?
<Rodman> Oh?
<ValtheWizard> meh, Duke is dead. I say let him rest with his history of amazing games (not acknowledging DNF)
<DesertRose> oh cool
<ValtheWizard> Rodman: There's nothing of substance to them. It's the same formula over and over again
<Wrek> 5though i would like to see a modern version of shadow warriro
<DesertRose> theres an expand feature on youtube now....
<Dashite> DNF made money for Gearbox. He will be back with something designed from the ground up by Gearbox.
<DeadBarney> Leonon: hell yeah
<Riders> Duke was dead a long time ago. Gearbox is just trying to reinvent him
<Dashite> AND GHOSTIES!
<Dashite> Is gone.
<Dashite> Damn,.
<Rodman> (DNF didn't happen.), LONG LIVE DN3D!
<Wrek> 5am i the only one that played shadow warrior?
<ValtheWizard> and I think it's best to let him lie, don't rustle up the dead
<Wrek> 5:C
<ValtheWizard> he had a good run
<RobotPinkie> Nope Wrek
<ValtheWizard> hell, he had an amazing run
<Wrek> 5:D
<ValtheWizard> it's best to just leave him as a legend
<Galadriel> alright you guys
<Galadriel> what do you want to see?
<Wrek> 5how long untill stream starts?
<Wrek> 5LOTR that is
<Galadriel> 11many hours :)
<Riders> I don't blame Gearbox for DNF. Nothing could be done to salvage that train wreck
<RobotPinkie> Shadow Warrior is open source now, also, which is nice :)
<ValtheWizard> 5 hous I think wrek
<Rodman> ValtheWizard: We all know how well that went for poor Ashley Williams
<ValtheWizard> hours* even
<Wrek> 5okiedokie
<RobotPinkie> still have to buy it for the data files, but eh...
<VioletVanilla> Wrek. . .
<ValtheWizard> Rodman: Lawl. She can suck it, I hated her :P
<VioletVanilla> You forgot the lokie. . .

<RobotPinkie> Aw, I like clowns...
<AppleDash[BronyCola]> he does mostly Ponibooru, but i think you can send stuff in
<EdwardNewgate> Did the other wizard die before the Trilogy?
<Blums> he browses poniboory, DA, and other sites, and looks over submissions
<FluffyWuffs> I see
<ValtheWizard> Wizards? Yes
<firelight> XD... that is considered a talent ?
<VioletVanilla> Gandalf goes on the boat. thus, not leaving any of his powers. . .
<CogWeaver> you can send it in to him directly to his email if you really want, but that's not usually prefered
<ValtheWizard> again, he's a special case
<FluffyWuffs> well then, I have some pony material I'm working on. The bad thing is I'm working on too many at once >.<
<Wrek> 5this is hilarious
<EdwardNewgate> I thought there was only Gandalf, Soromon, and one other
<FluffyWuffs> I'll start submitting soon
<FluffyWuffs> XD
<VioletVanilla> And if you read Silmarillion. . .
<WhatPayne> Stephen King is right... Clowns are more scary than funny
<ValtheWizard> there were like....4 or 5, can't remember
<FluffyWuffs> okay, Cog
<Purple`Prose> Everything turned out well
<Wrek> 5my brain cant handle all these nostalgia memories
<Wrek> 5god damned it
<ValtheWizard> lol
<ValtheWizard> who needs G3.5 when you can troll with nostalgia? :P
<firelight> hey anypony knows something about the second movie of the guardians of ga'hoole ?
<RobotPinkie> Who needs to dress in style when Rainbow Dash always does it for you?
<DeadBarney> Oh

<ValtheWizard> well, it's called "The Lost EpisodE"
<Galadriel> 7the lost ep pt 1
<ValtheWizard> Ivy might just be there for the beginning
<MeteorVenture> lol ya i remembered her shortly after saying that
<Wrek> 5its strangley familliar
<RobotPinkie> lol that makes sense
<Barry> I can see why it's a lost episode
<Wrek> 5only in america
<VioletVanilla> <33 Madame Galadriel is awesome :3
*Galadriel 7bows
<RobotPinkie> Agreed
<ValtheWizard> indeed, your hard work is appreciated Queen of the Elves
<Riders> Dat Ass
<Wrek> 5game
<Wrek> 5games can =riddles
<Wrek> 5im guessing riddler
<Wrek> 5WIN!
<ValtheWizard> I love Riddler episodes
<Riders> Neil Patrick Harris as the Riddler. Who agrees?
<Wrek> 5^
<MeteorVenture> patrick star as the riddler? what?
<RobotPinkie> That would work very well
<firelight> me too... but i hear rumors about a second part
<Riders> MeteorVenture = What are you talking about
<MeteorVenture> spongebob.. patrick star is the pink starfish fellow
<Rodman> Man, I really want to see the Over the Edge episode
<DeadBarney> that would be awesome
<Sketchy_Sounds> ?
<EdwardNewgate> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb8fWUUXeKM
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Mark Hamill Laughing" - "Mark Hamill is The Joker"
<DeadBarney> ?
<Riders> MeteorVenture = What does that have to do with the Riddler
<Sketchy_Sounds> You guys on about Season 2?
<Leonon> What season 2?
<DeadBarney> we're talking about a movie
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh right
<DeadBarney> the guardians of ga'hoole
<RobotPinkie> The Riddler? No, this is Patrick!
<Rodman> I'm not a crusty crab. :(
<MeteorVenture> "Neil Patrick Harris as the Riddler. Who agrees?" "patrick star as the riddler? what?"
<Galadriel> 7Robotpinkie?
<Galadriel> 7Can you PM me?
<MeteorVenture> neil PATRICK harris
<Leonon> who?
<CogWeaver> hoo?
<Riders> Do you know who Neil Patrick Harris is?
<RobotPinkie> I think I did, hopefully...
<EdwardNewgate> That one gay guy
<RobotPinkie> He's Dr. Horrible.
<MeteorVenture> nah i don't know who he is but i know the name
<Riders> The Music Meister
<CogWeaver> man, I don't think I've EVER seen the chat this dead
<Rodman> OW!
<MeteorVenture> :| still don't know who he is
<EdwardNewgate> IT'S THE MUSIC MEISTER~~~~~
<Rodman> His hand was covered in glass!
<Blums> There are deader chats out there
<Leonon> 3 people idling forever
<HaysforPonies> Mostly dead or all dead?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Welcome to EquestriaIdly ;p
<Leonon> !derp
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: PMV: What Would Spike Do / Everywhere I Trot / Late Friday Night (http://tinyurl.com/4y2hy37)
<CogWeaver> HaysforPonies: Part dead
<Riders> He was also Flash in Justice League: The New Frontier, and Night Wing in Under The Red Hood.
<HaysforPonies> So a zombie?
<CogWeaver> partly dead, mostly dead, or all dead
<MeteorVenture> wtf? so they actually had superpowers in batman?
<Dashite> Yup
<ValtheWizard> some of the villains, yes
<MeteorVenture> then he became frieza.. or cooler
<Dashite> Music Meister was an awesome episode.
<CogWeaver> also, apparently it's difficult for a dead body to make the "F" sound, so it always comes out saying "V"
<EdwardNewgate> The music meister is just a badass
<FluffyWuffs> bbl
<FluffyWuffs> gotta relocate
<CHAENNE> Lord of the rings today right?
<Dashite> Yes
<CHAENNE> :D
<ValtheWizard> eeyup
<DeadBarney> gotta tune mah guitar to practice winter wrap up
<Dashite> lol
<CogWeaver> also the "B" sound is nearly impossible
<Dashite> Turn intp wheel and roll away
<CHAENNE> oh cool what are we watching
<Riders> Poison Ivy, Clay Face, Bane, and several others. Batman has his fair share of super human enemies
<Dashite> Batman The Animated SEries.
<Rodman> Batman
<CogWeaver> ...
<MeteorVenture> an earthbender would have a really easy time taking this guy out
*CogWeaver is bored
<Rodman> Apparently, water is lethal
<Rodman> Wat
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Ummm...
<Wrek> 5clay+water
<CogWeaver> --crickets--
<RobotPinkie> Same thing with Sandman
<Dashite> It's Gotham, have you seen how polluted they are? :p
<Nickel_Scream> Ive been practicing winter wrap up on my guitar too! :D
<Leonon> go set fire to something if you're bored
*Muffin_Overlord_Derpy gives CogWeaver a paper tube of magic.
<Purple`Prose> Oh heck yeah
*HaysforPonies is very tired but can't sleep in the heat.
<MeteorVenture> why would he be on a ship then? it's like being surrounded by a sea of death
<Purple`Prose> That Mitchell and Webb Look
<CogWeaver> 8D
*CogWeaver tapes the paper tube to his forehead*
<Nickel_Scream> I saw the chrod book for the show.
<RobotPinkie> Yay Purple`Prose!
<CogWeaver> AHM A YOONICORN!
<Blums> If you were a hedgehog you could put your face in it
<Nickel_Scream> I really wanna play art of the dress but B minors still a bit hard for me to pull off.
<Tictac> Hello peoples :D
<CHAENNE> definately won't start untill about 4 hours from now, right?
<ValtheWizard> hello tictac
<RobotPinkie> hey Tictac
<ValtheWizard> you got it Chaenne
<RobotPinkie> LOLOL
<Sketchy_Sounds> Bm isn't that hard
<CHAENNE> ok, dont want to miss anyhting but i guess i can log off and do work for a few ore hrs
<Sketchy_Sounds> Just bar an Am on fret 2.
<CHAENNE> bye all
<Dashite> Octavia.
<ValtheWizard> right now our Lady Galadriel is presenting us favorable tv show streams :P
<ValtheWizard> later chaenee
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's how I play 'em
<ValtheWizard> chaenne* even
<Octavia> 14Dats me
<RobotPinkie> later CHAENNE
<VioletVanilla> Dat Grass <3
<ValtheWizard> ohai octavia
<Galadriel> 7See you in a bit CHAENNE
<ValtheWizard> I didn't see you log in :P
<Tictac> Sadly I think I may only be able to stay for the Fellowship lest my bandwidth be destroyed
<Nickel_Scream> what does Bar mean?
<Nickel_Scream> Sorry I'm very inexperienced and compeltely self-taught.
<Sketchy_Sounds> You've not been playing guitar long, then
<ValtheWizard> sorry to hear that tictac
*Sketchy_Sounds nods
<Sketchy_Sounds> OK
<Sketchy_Sounds> What it means is this
<Octavia> 14ai thar Val
<Octavia> 14*hai
<ValtheWizard> if it makes you feel better, I'm in a library with such little bandwidth I have to refresh every minute or so :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> Make a regular Am shape, using only your 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers
<Tictac> I'd set the stream to low but then I'm just watching some angry pixels
<Wrek> 5its brittish alright
<ValtheWizard> and how are you this fine Friday Octavia?
<Octavia> 14Tired. Just got up a few ago. :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> Now, slide that up so your fingers are occupying the 3rd and 4th frets.
<ValtheWizard> ah
<Galadriel> 7angry pixels? :o
<Dermathil> >mfw this is wow...
<ValtheWizard> they're very angry :P
<Tictac> I'll be back in 3 HOurs 51 Mins and 20 Seconds
<VioletVanilla> Angry pixels are angry!
<ValtheWizard> lol, see you later tictac
<Sketchy_Sounds> Then put your first finger over all the strings on the second fret, essentially as though you were using your finger as a capo.
<VioletVanilla> byebye Tictac!
<RobotPinkie> XD
<RobotPinkie> later Tictac
<Rodman> I'll be back in three hours as well
<ValtheWizard> see you then rodman
<Dermathil> cya Rodman
<Rodman> Stream will start in about 4 hours right?
<RobotPinkie> later Rodman
<Nickel_Scream> wow that works! but its pretty hard to hold those notes. My pinkie is my worst finger currently.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or alternatively, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBnS4uhaXAI Watch this video to learn how
<Galadriel> 7NEXT UP: Darkwing duck
<ValtheWizard> eeyup rodman
<Dermathil> :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> OK sounds like you managed fine ;p
<Sketchy_Sounds> And yeah
<Rodman> Alright, see you then
<Sketchy_Sounds> It takes some getting used to using your pinkie
<Nickel_Scream> I type and a draw too. My hands are the only part of me thats impresive. hahah.
<Galadriel> 7suddenly advertisements
<VioletVanilla> YESSS
<Nickel_Scream> I should buy tiny weights and give my pinkie a montage.
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah, barring an Am on fret 2 is the easiest way to play a Bm IMO
<RobotPinkie> aw you're not playing the whole ep?
<VioletVanilla> Thank you my lady <3
<Galadriel> 7I will
<RobotPinkie> <3
<Sketchy_Sounds> Plus also once you get the hang of that it makes playing a lot of other songs easier.
<Purple`Prose> FOOTBALL
<Nickel_Scream> How so?
<Sketchy_Sounds> For example if you wanted to play Wild Thing, it's an E, then an E barred on the fifth, then on the 7th, then back to the 5th and back down to an E.
<VioletVanilla> IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TRACK OF FOOTBALL
<Dermathil> JOHN MADDEN. owait, wrong football...
<Galadriel> 7lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh and to use an MLP example: At The Gala is nothing more than sliding A and E varinats around the frets.
<RobotPinkie> haha
<Dermathil> wow
<Sketchy_Sounds> **variants
<Galadriel> 7Dry :D
<Galadriel> 7Sometimes fires go out
<VioletVanilla> Whoops~
<VioletVanilla> DULL DULL
<VioletVanilla> UNBEARABLY DULL
<VioletVanilla> <3
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah. It'll become very useful once you start to realise what bar chords map to where.
<Sketchy_Sounds> For example: barre an E on the first fret and you have an F, barre it on the third and you're playing a G.
<Dermathil> hey Wrek
<Nickel_Scream> >>;; I guess I need to go to a real music class then..
<Octavia> 14Hai thar Wrek
<ValtheWizard> ohai wrek
<Wrek> just relogged
<Nickel_Scream> this sounds awful complex.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's honestly not
<ValtheWizard> you still get an ohai anyway :P
<Sketchy_Sounds> I learned that without music classes.
<Dermathil> LOL TB
<Dermathil> TB or not TB...
<Sketchy_Sounds> Let's just use an easy example so you get what I'm on about.
<Sketchy_Sounds> You know how to play a G, right?
<RobotPinkie> bit weird isn't it....
<Dermathil> looool
<Purple`Prose> XD
<Nickel_Scream> yeah
<Octavia> 14I really like the banners too Wrek, awesome. :D
<Nickel_Scream> I can play winter wrap-up with the thing in front of me
<Sketchy_Sounds> Play yourself a G. Then, take your E chord and slide it on up so your fingers are in the fourth and fifth frets, and barre the third fret.
<Nickel_Scream> It just doesnt sound perfect (because I dont always hit chrods properly when switching)
<Dermathil> >mfw I just noticed the extremely awesome banner
<ValtheWizard> :P
<Barry> Hi, all
<Galadriel> 7inhouse made!
<RobotPinkie> hey Barry
<Octavia> 14I watched him draw that Frodo last night a bit. X3
<Sketchy_Sounds> You should notice you are getting the same tone both times. Like magic!
<EdwardNewgate> Galadriel, you should change your nick to Hurricane.
<EdwardNewgate> Geddit?
<Dermathil> lawl
<Galadriel> 7eeeyup
<EdwardNewgate> lol
<Hurricane> 7I'll update it again before our theme weekend starts
<Purple`Prose> Sir Digby Chicken Ceaser!
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<EdwardNewgate> It's pretty much an inside joke anyway, most people wouldn't get it
<Hurricane> 7Val?
<Nickel_Scream> @_@ guitars are insanity.
<Hurricane> 7Did you try IE?
<ValtheWizard> yeah, did my PM not go through?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Naa, they're simple.
<Dermathil> LOL
<Hurricane> 7nope
<Sketchy_Sounds> You just gotta pace yourself with what you learn and when
<Hurricane> 7working fine here with cell phone connection
<ValtheWizard> oh...well that's frustrating
<ValtheWizard> I'll send it again
<ValtheWizard> did that one work?
<User_5991> hello
<User_5991> is somepony here?
<Nickel_Scream> yeah thats one of my biggest problems. I get easily dicouraged because I have a lot of friends who pick up new skills much faster and I get jealous and annoyed. XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'll likely be doing a stream of me playing later tonight if you fancy tuning in
<AllisZero> Winter wrap-up winter wrap-up~
<Silfir> Playing what
<Sketchy_Sounds> Guitar. Ooh, and maybe some of my other instruments too, this time.
<Dermathil> DWARVES

<DeadBarney> hi User_5991
<Sketchy_Sounds> I could bang our some Zelda tunes on my ocarina.

<User_5991> chanel?
<Bjornfot> what the fuck am i watching
<Silfir> I'd just stick around EqD once the day is up
<Sketchy_Sounds> I imagine MasterLinkX will continue the awesome job he's been doing
<User_5991> the ones i visit are out, i know
<Silfir> Pretty sure it's going to be all over the news
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah, keep your eyes on Equestria Daily.
<User_5991> thanks
<Silfir> I'm also assuming there's going to be a livestream someplace for those who can't wait for the 2 hour rip/encode process
<User_5991> that was quick
<Purple`Prose> That Mitchell and Webb Look
<Hurricane> 7meet Bronze
<Hurricane> 7Bronze is your friend
<Sketchy_Sounds> Wouldn't know offhand
<Hurricane> 7goddd
<Silfir> Well, we ARE MLP fans
<User_5991> i can wait
<Silfir> I'm in Germany and I have the exact same concerns as you do
<Silfir> Ponies unify the world
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm in the UK and also have such concerns.
<Bjornfot> Are they supposed to be vikings?
<User_5991> but i like to know where i will wait

<VioletVanilla> Is this Minecraft?

<Prison> In order to avoid conflicting times between Brony Movie Night and The Marshmallow, my show has been changed to Saturday night at 8 pm EST.
<Silfir> User_5991, that was probably trolls
<Silfir> If Hasbro wanted the Youtube episodes blocked, they'd have been way more successful
<Leonon> Habsro is legit man
<Dermathil> nice!
<User_5991> many channels remove his videos
<sotha> This weekend's schedule is interesting. So it's one ep of LotR, and two of pony each night, starting at 7pmEST. That's pretty cool.

<Silfir> That article is old like wow
<B-Man> But yeah, not like I'm saying anything new.
<B-Man> I know.
<VioletVanilla> oh shi--
<B-Man> But not all of us had read it then.
<Nittany_Tiger> Wow. Quite full for this time of day.
<VioletVanilla> <333
<Octavia> 14Been SO long since I've watched this show
<Silfir> :)
<VioletVanilla> DARKWING DUCK
<Silfir> I know
<Octavia> 14Lets get dangerous!
<Meanwhile> Oh wow
<sotha> Not as cool as Ducktales.
<RobotPinkie> Sathi: /)^3^(\
<Meanwhile> Nostalgia trip
<Hipster_Brony> 8all my nostalgia
<B-Man> It's a look back, and still a classic example of um...
<VioletVanilla> Cooler than~
<Silfir> It's only the second worst example of MLP-related research though
<RobotPinkie> Lets get dangerous!
<Dashite> It's nostalgia day.
<User_5991> so? Everything is okay?
<Dermathil> Hipster_Brony, we watched an episode or two of Duck Tales yesterday
<RobotPinkie> oh lol, I think I'm lagging behind
<Silfir> Did you see the article in the feminist magazine
<B-Man> Ms?
<Prison> Dick Tales
<Dashite> Freakazoid, Batman, Darkwing Duck.
<sotha> Can we listen to the Ducktales theme?
<Prison> WOOHOO
<Silfir> I think so
<sotha> sometime later, I mean
<EdwardNewgate> Duck Dodgers is better
<Prison> dicktales
<B-Man> The "Smart shaming etc etc one"
<Prison> dick
<Prison> tales
<Prison> dicktails
<Silfir> Yup
<Leonon> that is rather old news
<B-Man> I think so.
<Silfir> So was cartoonbrew
<B-Man> I haven't read it in a while.
<Prison> Darkwing Dick
<Prison> Let's get dangerous.
<User_5991> i just hear that
<Silfir> Still, it's always nice to look at that stuff from to time
<B-Man> It's still a classic example of how to be ignorant.
<Silfir> MLP history
<VioletVanilla> That's not the only scent in the air ;D
<VioletVanilla> eheheheheh~
<Prison> The other scent is dickfumes
<Ersatz> Duck can be changed into several different offensive words with only one letter of difference.
<Prison> because he's darkwing dick
<Ersatz> Darkwing Dick, Darkwing Fuck
<Prison> BREAKFAST
<Ersatz> (You learn these things when your usual game alias has the word Duck in it)
<Meanwhile> Who does the voice?
<B-Man> You know, I think that it's a testament to the show's strength that it has overcome the MLP stigma. So says Mr Repetition.
<Prison> Me
<Prison> I'm the voice actor for Darkwing Duck.
<VioletVanilla> This is how I have my breakfast o:
<Meanwhile> That explains everything.
<SummerRain> hey guys :p
<B-Man> But it's still true, and it's still fun to remember and reflect.
<Meanwhile> How unrealistic
<B-Man> And remind ourselves of just what we are a part of.
<Meanwhile> Everyone knows toast lands butter side down
<Retsamoreh> As a featureless box, I have the best pokerface in the universe. Fun fact there.

<VioletVanilla> O^O
<Silfir> Don't worry, I don't know either
<VioletVanilla> RAMROD
<Silfir> I've been watching loads of Legend of Galactic Heroes these days
<Nickel_Scream> actually taht article just goes to show you the sorry state of feminism in this country. Instead of looking towards real issues where people are actually getting unfair shakes you analyze a cartoon and try to bring out hidden offenses.
<Hipster_Brony> dat grammar
<Silfir> To be fair, it's the sorry state of one feminist
<Silfir> And they did publish Faust's rebuttal
<Retsamoreh> Oh, yea, I forgot most of you guys are new and/or late. I'm a box.
<Barry> Not always, Meanwhile
<Prison> Your stay in Prison
<Prison> He's inside me.
<Meanwhile> My toast always landed butterside down, so i don't eat it any more.
<Prison> It suits his businees perfectly
<User_5991> so, one feminist try to shot down MLP?
<ValtheWizard> kinky
<Silfir> Yeah, without ever watching it
<Nickel_Scream> I've encountered more than a few people who remind of that stance. I'm just saying there are people who want to do the right thing but are so eager to fight the good fight they have emotional, knee-jerk reactions to percieved slights.
<Prison> LUGGAGE
<B-Man> I have no problem with feminism, except when it attempts to undermine guys and give them no credit.
<B-Man> Of course, the same can be said for the other extreme when women get no credit.
<Meanwhile> Do you think birdwatcher and stalker mean the same thing in that city?
<User_5991> somepony have the article, i want to read it
<Silfir> In other words, you have nothing against feminism, you have something against people being dumbasses
<VioletVanilla> MAAAANDARRRRK
<Octavia> 14Dat Mandark
<VioletVanilla> IT'S MAAAAANNNNDDDARRRKKKK
<VioletVanilla> AHA
<VioletVanilla> AHAHA
<VioletVanilla> HA
<VioletVanilla> HA
<User_5991> sorry for the bad english by the way
<VioletVanilla> HAAA
<The_Si> *lightning*
<Retsamoreh> I thought everyone had something against people being dumbasses.
<User_5991> hey, like me
<Silfir> [someone being a dumbass]http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/09/my-little-homophobic-racist-smarts-shaming-pony/
<Silfir> Yeah, but I think it helps to distinguish whether you have something against feminism per se or people being dumbasses
<Silfir> People can try to be feminists and be dumbasses about it, in that case, the offending behavior is being a dumbass, not being a feminist
<firelight> TCIF !!
<Meanwhile> Ah, when cartoons could actually say dead.
<Barry> ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha
<Silfir> Also, I'm an unbearable pedant
<Silfir> Who should be dragged out onto the street and shot
<DesertRose> that link does not work btw
<Barry> The best thing about that laugh, it's a palindrome.
<Barry> reads the same forwards and backwards
<User_5991> works for me
<Silfir> huh, that's strange, I picked it out of my history
<DesertRose> but yea from looking at the url i can see thats old news
<Barry> each segment, I mean
<DesertRose> it hasnt been entered into IRC correctly
<DeadBarney> I can't get on that fuckin' website
<Silfir> No, its the website that's not loading
<Silfir> I can't get to the article from google either
<DeadBarney> Oh
<DeadBarney> It's just ultra-slow
<User_5991> the link works for me
<Silfir> What kind of hyper-internet do people in Argentina have :P
<DeadBarney> and I found that too http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal/
<DeadBarney> but it's loading too
<Silfir> Like I said, that's Faust's rebuttal
<Barry> I know how to make it a palindromic laugh: Ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha ahaha
<Silfir> It's pretty awesome
<DeadBarney> Oh, k ^^
<RobotPinkie> yay Pinkie Pie styling went well!
<Meanwhile> I sometimes mistake the front of the plane for the back.
<Silfir> I only read the original article once, but I reread Faust's bit several times because she's being so awesome in it
<User_5991> we have 5 M, wich isnt very much
<DesertRose> yea
<User_5991> somepone have the answe from Faust?
<DesertRose> faust dealt with those numitz very quickly and has a shit ton of support behind her
<B-Man> Silfer: Yeah
<DesertRose> wait....the site works....just very very slow
<Silfir> User_5991: That's the other link, the one DeadBarney posted
*HotCocoa wonders how many chocolate-themed people are in here right now.
<Silfir> Also, get a proper name
<DeadBarney> The page loaded \o/

<Silfir> or somesuch?
<Leonon> it's toho, it's in all the keys
<Meanwhile> Seems legit.
*Leonon knows more about memes than music

<DeadBarney> Wow. That article was just a big pile of bullshit.
<FluffyWuffs> !msg Owlicious
<FluffyWuffs> gah
<Silfir> Read the rebuttal and console himself with the thought that the article had to exist to allow such awesomeness
<Silfir> console yourself
<Purple`Prose> bck
<Silfir> I fail at writering

<CrossBreeze> 12Hello ponies. Just setting up for the show later.
<Dermathil> hey CrossBreeze
<Reaver21> No wai. that was NaviX! I've never seen that anywhere but on modded xBox's!
<Sathi> 7:)
<Lawdee> badubadub
<Lawdee> I'm bored
<Sathi> 7tis awesome
<Sathi> 7I love it
<FluffyWuffs> mmh
<FluffyWuffs> so how bout dem ponies?
<FluffyWuffs> and stuff
<Leonon> go outside, set fire to yourself, film it, post on internet
<FluffyWuffs> k bro?
<Reaver21> I'd have it too, if it weren't for my brother moving out and taking the xBox with him~ Say, could this be viewed by modded xBoxs?
<FluffyWuffs> wat
<FluffyWuffs> how bout, no
<FluffyWuffs> :P
<MeteorVenture> is that the same voice actor as whoever did chuckie's voice? (from the rugrats)
<Leonon> but then you won't be bored
<Sathi> 7if you got a browser build in you should be able to yes
<FluffyWuffs> touche
<Derpy_Hooves> Hi
<FluffyWuffs> but I also don't like the idea of setting myself on fire
<Leonon> DERP!
<FluffyWuffs> it might hurt :[
<FluffyWuffs> hey Derpy
<Derpy_Hooves> Hai
<User_5991> im back
<MeteorVenture> cannot unhear even if it's not
<HotCocoa> I think he was talking to Lawdee, because Lawdee said he was bored
<Reaver21> lulz
<FluffyWuffs> hiya user_{numbers here}
*Sathi 7doesnt have a modded xbox
<Leonon> fire only hurts if it doesn't respect you
<Barry> What do you guys think of Skyrim appearing exclusively on the XBox 360 for 30 days before appearing elsewhere?
<User_5991> wow that was a really good answer fomr Faust
<RandomExtra> She does sound like him now that I think about it.
<Reaver21> I mad, bro. PC gamer for life.
<FluffyWuffs> it's the smoke that really kills you faster
<Dashite> Don't care about the game myself, but timed exclusives suck.
<Derpy_Hooves> Is there any confirmation of Derpy becoming a real character in Season 2?
<HotCocoa> Lauren could've said "bitch, please." and it would've gotten the same reaction.
<SummerRain[disc> XD
<Lawdee> Hai
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Fell Into the Right Hooves (http://tinyurl.com/4yvd5hs)
<Reaver21> believe it or not, I'm playing FO3 on my other monitor right now..
<HotCocoa> Derpy_Hooves: no, but she's already more or less canon, she just doesn't have a spoken name yet.
<Leonon> Lauren Faust has a vague idea what she's doing
<HotCocoa> As in, nopony in the show has said who she is.
<Dashite> I'm playing Deus Ex Human Revolution.
<Nittany_Tiger> Developers/publishers love the 360.
<Derpy_Hooves> Ok
<Sathi> 7NEXT UP: Pinky and the brain
<Derpy_Hooves> I hope she does lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Should tell you that Skyrim will be a console port as well.
<FluffyWuffs> Hopefully, the name Derpy will stick
<Nittany_Tiger> Nothing new to PC gamers.
<FluffyWuffs> instead of Dinky
<DesertRose> bold
<Leonon> Derpy can be like a waifu, real in your heart
<DesertRose> yea....
<FluffyWuffs> either way, I'd be satisfied
<Silfir> Ditzy Doo is supposed to be Derpy
<DesertRose> underlined
<Nittany_Tiger> Getting crapped on by the mainstream industry.
<Reaver21> Pinky and the Brain? Oh yes. :Thisisgood:
<DeadBarney> Wow. That article was just a big pile of AWESOME.
<Derpy_Hooves> Yes
<FluffyWuffs> inb4italics.jpg
*Nittany_Tiger is at school and can't watch :<
<Derpy_Hooves> Ditzy_Doo is Derpy's beta name
<Reaver21> Well, duh. It's how they're getting money.
<Nittany_Tiger> I know.
<FluffyWuffs> what article?
<Derpy_Hooves> I reckon her voice should sound a bit like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYZPVVGxGws&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
<User_5991> i like Derpy
<RobotPinkie> hey Nittany_Tiger
<Reaver21> :wut: School?
<Silfir> Faust's in Msmagazine
<Nittany_Tiger> They're business, and they're bad business though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm a grad student.
<Leonon> she has one line in season 1
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi RobotPinkie
<Derpy_Hooves> Muffiiins
<Derpy_Hooves> THAT IS ALL
<FluffyWuffs> MUFFINS
<Derpy_Hooves> And
<MeteorVenture> just don't break the flow or get into heavy metal and she should continue to sleep
<FluffyWuffs> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARUUGH
<Derpy_Hooves> A angry noice
<Derpy_Hooves> Like a shocked noise
<Reaver21> Woops. Just jumped in a rad pit, 30+ rads a sec LOL.
<HotCocoa> !muffins
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Derpy_Hooves> Hooooooooagh
<HotCocoa> Yes.
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps HotCocoa
<Dashite> :p
<Derpy_Hooves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYZPVVGxGws&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
<Derpy_Hooves> Is a good voice for her
*HotCocoa gets a shotgun and looks at Colgate|Zombie.
<Riders> Dashite = How's Human Revolution?
<Nittany_Tiger> I should reload FO3 and put a mod or two on it that makes it more fun to play.
<Colgate|Zombie> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<FluffyWuffs> (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
<Dashite> It's really good.
<Argenrpony> now i have a name
<RainbowBrisk> you guys think radio shack would have an adapter for a random internet modem?
<Reaver21> Nittany_tiger That's a good idea.
<WhatPayne> So spoilers plz. I just got the game today.
<Nittany_Tiger> Funny thing: I can't think of any major title coming out that is allowing mods.
<Leonon> radio shack still exists?
<Reaver21> Skyrim should, like all of the Oblivions and Fallouts.
<RainbowBrisk> apparently.
<Dashite> You want spoilers?
<Argenrpony> radio shack?
<Derpy_Hooves> http://ganton3.deviantart.com/art/INSTANT-MACINTOSH-Flash-210776562? BEST BUTTON EVER!
<Nittany_Tiger> No.
<Reaver21> NO.
<RainbowBrisk> reminds me of uhhhhh
<WhatPayne> No
<Dashite> That's what I thought.
<HotCocoa> Oh, THAT kind of zombie.
<Riders> How does it compare to the first 2? No spoilers please
<Nittany_Tiger> I might get that title later on.
*HotCocoa puts his gun away.
<RainbowBrisk> kung pow
<ValtheWizard> 0SPOILER: He doesn't want spoilers
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't played the first one.
<RainbowBrisk> guy is hurt and dying, being carried back to town by the hero
<Dashite> Haven't played the second one.
<Colgate|Zombie> I missed my last nap :(
<RobotPinkie> lol I think he meant "no," not "so".
<RainbowBrisk> guy, struggling to survive, goes "tell me..... if you see..... a radio shack"
<Reaver21> Holy shit. Wind is kicking out here. I live along the coast, and that hurricane..
<RobotPinkie> There is no second one.
<Derpy_Hooves> Eyup
<Ersatz> Darkwing Dip.
<WhatPayne> Oh dammit that typo
<Sathi> 7Hurricane me...
<Dashite> The gameplay is much improved from the first one. The hacking minigame is awesome.
<HotCocoa> eeyup.wav
<Ersatz> I thought this -WAS- the second one.
<RobotPinkie> Well, before Human Revolution...
<Derpy_Hooves> http://ganton3.deviantart.com/art/INSTANT-MACINTOSH-Flash-210776562?
<Leonon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbYXvSKjP98
<Nittany_Tiger> Go hurricane Sathi!
<DeadBarney> FluffyWuffs: what are you trying to do ?
<RobotPinkie> yes, it is Ersatz :P
<Reaver21> Sathi shall be hurricaned.
<ValtheWizard> 0SATHI! Y U HURRICANE PEOPLE?
*FluffyWuffs : give me a hug RainbowBrisk (ノ゜3゜)ノ
<FluffyWuffs> get a hug
<Sathi> 7I dunno :(
<Riders> The second one was called Invisible War. This is the third
<Nittany_Tiger> Come here!
<Dashite> Ersatz, I dunno. I have this weird feeling that it isn't, but I dunno why. Oh well. :)
<FluffyWuffs> wait wat
<Nittany_Tiger> I want a hurricane.
<DeadBarney> What are those chars ?
<TyeDyeBrony> Here I am! Rockin' like a Hurricane!
<FluffyWuffs> what are you seeing?
<Reaver21> But seriously, I live in Savannah, so all I'ma get should be some really strong storms.
<FluffyWuffs> squaress?
<Sathi> 7<< name is Irene
<Nittany_Tiger> It's "Rock you like a hurricane."
<RobotPinkie> Invisible what now? I don't believe in such things
<Reaver21> Nittany knows it! I've been thinking of that song..
<DeadBarney> (ã??ã??3ã??)ã??
<TyeDyeBrony> I haven't hard the song in a long time
<AllisZero> Thas adorable, Sathi
<ValtheWizard> 0Yeah, Riders is just going crazy
<TyeDyeBrony> gimme a break
<WhatPayne> Anyone has the Human Revolution for PC? How's it handling? Not too performance heavy?
<ValtheWizard> 0everyone knows there are only two Deus Ex games out :P
<Colgate|Zombie> font is probably missing those characters
<Derpy_Hooves> Thats it I am looking for MLP minecraft texture packs
<Argenrpony> im lost again, damn now i know how Derpy feels
<Riders> Invisible War was a sequel. This is a prequel.
<Dashite> WhatPayne, I have it for PC.
<FluffyWuffs> d'oh that sucks
<Nittany_Tiger> Was Invisible War that bad?
<FluffyWuffs> the first one was a table flip
<ValtheWizard> 0yes
<RobotPinkie> I did play a "game" called "Invisible Wars," but it's very clear that it was just a troll
<WhatPayne> Are you running how old rig?
<Reaver21> I'ma be pissed if mah internet goes out D:
<FluffyWuffs> server must be under linux
<ValtheWizard> 0that is all I will say
<Derpy_Hooves> Eyup
<Riders> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_War
<DeadBarney> Or i've got the wrong charset
<AllisZero> SOMEONE GAVE ME CHOCOLATE CHIP FLAVORED JELLY BEANS
<RobotPinkie> NO!
<AllisZero> AM I GOING TO DIE?
<ValtheWizard> 0THOU HAST LINKED AN ABOMINATION
<Derpy_Hooves> @Argenrpony Eyup
<FluffyWuffs> got windows 7?
<ValtheWizard> 0THOU MUST DIE RIDERS
<RobotPinkie> NO SUCH THING!
<Colgate|Zombie> FluffyWuffs: wait, what does linux have to do with it?
*ValtheWizard 0lunges at Riders with a trident
<DeadBarney> watno
<Meanwhile> inb4 fridge
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dashite> Invisible War was prfoundly meh. If it hadn't been a sequel to Deus Ex it probably wouldn't have as bad a reputation as it does.
<Riders> Invisible War wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as good as the first.
<FluffyWuffs> I suppose it passes through the server, then outputs the rest. I see the text fine, but some of you dont?
<Derpy_Hooves> ?
<Reaver21> DAT FRIDGE
<FluffyWuffs> Colgate, why are you a zombie...
<Colgate|Zombie> it only passes character codes, not the font
<FluffyWuffs> :/
<FluffyWuffs> can you see this?
<Colgate|Zombie> because I am extremely tired right now, and can't really think -.-
<DeadBarney> That's why i think i've got the wrong charset
<FluffyWuffs> (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻
<Riders> It's like what Dragon Age 2 was to Dragon Age 1. Okay, but nowhere in the same league
<Silfir> FluffyWuffs, I can see this
<Colgate|Zombie> I can see all of that
<Silfir> oh
<Silfir> that too
<Leonon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJpVddruaGo
<FluffyWuffs> :D
<FluffyWuffs> flipping more tables
<Silfir> Looks like some dude with a huge nose is angry
<Colgate|Zombie> because I have my charset to utf
<Reaver21> lol
<Dermathil> Is Launchpad gonna crash again?
<RobotPinkie> Well, I agree with the last part, Riders
<Dermathil> heheheh
<RobotPinkie> I guess it's like the Dark Alliance games kinda
<FluffyWuffs> ヽ(゜∇゜)ノ
<Dashite> Anyway, WhatPayne, I have a 3GHz dualcore, 4gb ram and a 4870. Deus Ex is running at 1920x1200 with everything on high. I should probably drop it down to 1680x1050 though.
*RobotPinkie gets dangerous
<DeadBarney> There was one chance on 3360, but winamp chose to play "art of the dress - reprise"
<DeadBarney> I lov u, wunemp
<Riders> RobotPinkie = Assuming your talking about Baldur's Gate, exactly
<Bjornfot> RobotPinkie, do you remember if we had this show in Sweden?
<RobotPinkie> Yeah we did, Bjornfot
<RobotPinkie> NU BLIR VI FARLIGA!

<RobotPinkie> Yeah, when were you born?
<Bjornfot> 93
<Dermathil> oh hello Bjornfot
<Derpy_Hooves> I am bored -Rubs muffin on cheeks-
<MeteorVenture> the little girl almost dies and then jokes about it a second later
<WhatPayne> Thanks for info Dashite, my system is not as good as yours. I was mainly interested because the gap between minimum and recommended is so huge.
<Bjornfot> i didn't like tv3 veyr much
<FluffyWuffs> winamp
<RobotPinkie> This aired like... 90's
<FluffyWuffs> ?
<DeadBarney> Winamp
<DeadBarney> like in "winamp"
<Colgate|Zombie> winamp, been a long time since I used that program ha
<DeadBarney> a media player
<FluffyWuffs> I use winamp, for music only
<FluffyWuffs> has some awesome skin
<DeadBarney> I always used winamp
<Reaver21> so, out of curiosity, who is controlling the stream right now?
<Colgate|Zombie> I used winamp for years
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, it had some good cartoons though in the early to mid 90's
<FluffyWuffs> winamp seems to lag videos for me
<Bjornfot> the girl mod, i think?
<ValtheWizard> 0that would be our one and only Hurricane :P
<DeadBarney> FluffyWuffs: why did ou ask "winamp ?" ?
<Colgate|Zombie> I never used it for videos
*Sathi 7nods

<Sathi> great
<Sathi> when will he be posting us?
<MeteorVenture> hearing him saying pinky over and over again is just making me think of pinkie pie more and more
<sotha> Oh wow.
<Dashite> Pinky only has eyes for one equine.
<herospirit> Is the stream dying for anyone else?
<RobotPinkie> You're not the only one who has Pinkie on the brain, MeteorVenture
<MeteorVenture> lol dat pun
<RobotPinkie> I..... totally should've done that differently
<Sathi> 7Our brain is full of ponies
<RobotPinkie> Looks like you have... *puts on sunglasses* ...Pinkie... on the brain.
<ValtheWizard> 0it is for me herospirit, but that's because I'm on my university's library wi-fi which is complete shit
<herospirit> This cartoon is so very politically correct
<Meanwhile> Dat lipsynch joke.
<Reaver21> I am enjoying this thoroughly.
<Sathi> 7Who requested the Looney tunes?
<RobotPinkie> This is an amazing show
<RandomExtra> Yes it is!
<RobotPinkie> watched it as a kid
<sotha> I want to watch my Luna tunes.
<herospirit> I watched it a lot too.
<sotha> Lol at the sandals.
<RobotPinkie> also watched some shows that I don't know if I'd like so much anymore...
<RobotPinkie> like James Bond Jr.
<RobotPinkie> I should request that :P
<Sathi> 7Don't think we have time for that
<RobotPinkie> That's okay
<MeteorVenture> i wonder how many people are still in the building
<herospirit> NONE NOW.
<Meanwhile> ^

<herospirit> WAIT.
<sotha> But wouldn't the Earth's orbit be completely desimated and and and. oh whatever
<herospirit> Sotha beat me to the question.
<Hipster_Brony> he didnt say in the email, but im guessing around 6
<Meanwhile> Who the hell is that guy anyway
<Meanwhile> I don't see.
<herospirit> Who knows.
<Dermathil> Sotha, only if the entire universe wasn't upsized too, including the laws of physics.
<Sathi> I received feedback from other viewers they wanted to be alerted earlier. Is there anything we can do about that?
<Meanwhile> I don't think you can 'upsize' physics.
<Dermathil> I know. This is called 'handwaving', Meanwhile.
<AllisZero> You can't
<HeavyMetalPony> Hello mah bronies
<AllisZero> But
<RobotPinkie> hey HeavyMetalPony
<Meanwhile> I was under the impression handwaving was a form of greeting
<ValtheWizard> 0hello HeavyMetalPony
<Meanwhile> Heyho HeavyMetalPony
<Reaver21> Facebook just can't handle my little ponies.
<Dermathil> this type of handwave: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave
<Purple`Prose> harsh

<HeavyMetalPony> I'm watching a 3+ hour movie at 1 AM after drinking three cups of coffee. I wasn't planning on sleep anyway.
<Sathi> hmm okay

<HeavyMetalPony> When I was in the Shakespeare play, my director said whoever got his reference to Pinky and the Brain would be the first name on the show catalog.
<Barry> for once he got something right
<HeavyMetalPony> I won :trollface:
<RobotPinkie> lol no rly?
<ValtheWizard> 0as my math teachers used to tell me
<Nittany_Tiger> whoops
<ValtheWizard> 0the calculator is never wrong, just the person operating it :P
<Nittany_Tiger> It's not grad * D.
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol.
<Barry> anything to the power of zero is 1

<sotha> What a role reversal?

<Nittany_Tiger> Square root of 2.
<desertman2> or that
<RobotPinkie> Nice

<Barry> @calc square root of 2

<sotha> Derpy: So Bran, what are we going to do tonight? *derp*. --- Bran: The same thing we do every night, Derpy; try to take over the world!
<Dermathil> Space Jam? Wasn't that the movie with Bugs Bunny and the basket ball? Wasn't that movie already streamed a few MONTHS ago?
<HeavyMetalPony> ^
<Nittany_Tiger> NASA needs billions to go to the moon. Orbiter is free.
<desertman2> yes it was
<Meanwhile> That's the one.
<Dermathil> Exactly
<Dermathil> So it needs to wait until 6 months have passed then
<Reaver21> I feel suffering.
<Sathi> 7eeeyup
<Meanwhile> It's still amazing.
<Dermathil> I remember that being the rule about duplicate movies
<Ersatz> Space Jam is the basis for the best RPG ever made.
<HeavyMetalPony> Would The Big Lebowski be considered a B movie or A movie?
<Darken_Skye> So is LOTR starting at 7?
<MeteorVenture> can't wait until we can watch the room again
<Ersatz> Barkley, Shut up and Jam: Gaiden.
<Dermathil> Btw, what movie night is this? I lost count at around movie night 12 I think.
<Dashite> Ersatz: :p
<Epsilon> Oh God, yes, best RPG ever
<Dumori> I pretty much called the room then missed it'stream
<AllisZero> A basketball RPG?
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Dashite> I think it's 15 tonight.
<AllisZero> Sounds boring
<Ersatz> You have no idea.
<Meanwhile> What was that movie with gene whatsisface as Frankenstein?
<sotha> Darken_Skye: 7pm EST
<Epsilon> It's amazing
<HeavyMetalPony> Gene Wilder
<Dermathil> I'm looking towards to the day CUBE will be the B-movie.
<MeteorVenture> i think my first movie night was with the room
<Dumori> thought it was 16...
<Darken_Skye> young frankenstien
<HeavyMetalPony> Young Frankenstein
<Meanwhile> You'd think i'd remember that
<Dermathil> Young Frankenstein was also streamed before
<Meanwhile> I know, it was awesome.
<Dermathil> yeah.
<RobotPinkie> is there any sound?
<Dashite> We'll figure it out when it gets posted on EqD later. :p
<Darken_Skye> we need to watch blazing saddles some night
<herospirit> *listening to Welcome Home by Coheed and Cambria while watching Loony Toons*
<Dermathil> Were you there then?
<Meanwhile> I was.
<Dumori> We shoudl totaly have a list of pervious streams
<Darken_Skye> I think I have a list somewhere
<RobotPinkie> agreed
<ValtheWizard> 0Dumori: I know Silverscreen made one a while back
<HeavyMetalPony> Dermathil, Cube could actually be viewed as good, Cube 2 was seen by me with 8 other guys, We had never laughed so much in years.
<ValtheWizard> 0where it is, I couldn't tell you
<Dumori> Yeah but on the site so we can alkl see it
<Purple`Prose> dat defiance of gravity
<HeavyMetalPony> lol, cartoon physics you so crazy
<Dermathil> Maybe, HMP, but the movie is still a cult classic and as such qualifies for B
<Wrek> back. what'd i miss?
<Sathi> 7wb Wrek
<Dermathil> Wrek, you missed Pinky and the Brain
<HeavyMetalPony> You missed the Brain song
<Dermathil> and wb
<ValtheWizard> 0welcome back wreck

<interior_gummy> silly bugs, just get fluttershy to hug them
<ValtheWizard> 0wrek* even
<Sathi> 7brain song was actually pretty good
<HeavyMetalPony> lol, this chat is so different from the 2pm streams, and the movie hasn't even strated yet.
<Dumori> brain song is epic...
<Dermathil> EEEEYUP HMP.
<RobotPinkie> srsly though, can anyone hear anything?
<Dermathil> Yes RP.
<Dashite> Nope
<interior_gummy> i can hear it
<Dumori> i hear voices...
<Dumori> :P
<ValtheWizard> 0I can hear the voices in my head. Does that count?
<MeteorVenture> i judt hope that MLP:FiM doesn't get a messed up idea of physics like some old cartoons (such as what we're watching)
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Dermathil> maybe refresh stream^
<Dashite> I think it's really, really quiet.
<HeavyMetalPony> The great thing about Looney Tunes is that there are so many episodes there always exists one you've never seen.
<Dumori> soudns fine for me
<Dermathil> MV, they do at times.
<Dermathil> YOu forgot pinkie pie
<desertman2> windows sounds
<Sathi> 7<< boosted sounds any better?
<ValtheWizard> 0MeteorVenture lol, watch Feeling Pinkie Keen again and watch the Fluttershy with a cart scene :P
<HeavyMetalPony> lol
<desertman2> Sounds are fine for me
<RobotPinkie> Yeah a bit better, I cranked up my volume a bit too
<Dumori> droped a bit hear by my rig is wacky with sounds
<MeteorVenture> lol good point val.. i did see that
<RobotPinkie> thank you Sathi :3
<HeavyMetalPony> Make 'Em Laugh
<Sathi> 7your welcome
<RobotPinkie> don't you know everyone wants to laugh
<HeavyMetalPony> We should totally watch Singin' in the Rain one night.
<interior_gummy> mlp already violates the laws of physics all the time
<Darken_Skye> Here is a list of all the previous movie nights http://mibpaste.com/1TSJX6
<RobotPinkie> my dad said "be an actor, my son. but be a comical one"
<interior_gummy> also, did we watch g3.5 last night?
<MeteorVenture> well ya i guess it kinda does.. but i guess the ways in which it does doesn't bother me in a "what a life cheater" sort of way
<Dumori> cool I've only missed 3 and i was her form stream 2
<HeavyMetalPony> Only I've missed were 2-4 and last weeks
<ValtheWizard> 0@interior_gummy DO NOT give Sathi any more ideas! We have been subjected to the horror enough!
<RobotPinkie> i think there was some g3.5, interior_gummy
<RobotPinkie> it was brilliant
<MeteorVenture> so was the the B cartoon?
<RobotPinkie> though i might be thinking of the day before....
<MeteorVenture> that*
<interior_gummy> in week 8, they both seem like b movies (funny ones, but still)
<HeavyMetalPony> I can't wait until we'll be able to choose between S1 episodes and S2 episodes for brony nights
<Meanwhile> I am reminded of when the super mario bros movie was on. talk about artistic liberties.
<MeteorVenture> i mean G3.5 made me wonder what would happen if there was an A movie and a B movie.. and then an A cartoon (MLP:FiM) and a B cartoon
<Purple`Prose> Anyone remember the Bugs Bunny cartoon that was basically Invasion of the Body Snatchers/Pod People
<HeavyMetalPony> No, but I've probably seen it.
<Purple`Prose> Carrots from space came down and replaced the other characters with defective copies...
<herospirit> Oh ffff....
<herospirit> Purple
<herospirit> I was trying to forget
<Darken_Skye> Are they still streaming cartoons every sunday night on synchtube?
<interior_gummy> ironic that the texas cowboy is a muslim now
<HeavyMetalPony> Yosemite might be the best character
<herospirit> We are thinking of the trouser pissing creepy episode, correct?
<interior_gummy> daffy is best character
<HeavyMetalPony> brb, gotta piss for two minutes straight
<Meanwhile> dat aim
<interior_gummy> wait no, wile is best
<Purple`Prose> Manly walking is manly
<Dermathil> Alright! So we're at Night 16!
<interior_gummy> A CAR

<WhatPayne> I know this show thanks to Nostalgia Critic
<Dermathil> interior_gummy: Twilight happens.
<Sumica> I think it's early 90's
<MeteorVenture> i think i was apparently supposed to remember this show
<MeteorVenture> but i don't
<Ghosties> 4Mid 90's I believe
<interior_gummy> honestly, too young to remember much before around ren & stimpy
<interior_gummy> and what a beautiful show it was
<HeavyMetalPony> Ren and Stimpy is older than this
<RobotPinkie> I guess it aired here on the nickelodeon channel... it hasn't been around that long
<interior_gummy> it was the newer episodes of that show
<Meanwhile> No one has ever won a competition about lawn with flamingoes on it.
<Sumica> The Adventures of Pete & Pete (TV Series 1993–1996)
<Meanwhile> Yeh when i was that age i was watching spooks of bottle bay.
<HeavyMetalPony> but Ren and Stimpy had reruns long after this ended
<Dumori> TF is this?
<Purple`Prose> The Adventures of Pete and Pete
<MeteorVenture> oh gosh they're southern
<Purple`Prose> It's...odd
<Dumori> so helpful
<HeavyMetalPony> ^The Big Lebowski for kids in every episode. That's basically this show.

<interior_gummy> @RobotPinkie I thought you liked Pinkie?
<Ghosties> 4I thought you would "dig" it

<RobotPinkie> Yeah, interior_gummy, but Steven_Magnet made Trixie best pony, so...
<RobotPinkie> I don't even like her much, but what can I do?
<HeavyMetalPony> THis show is so epic

<HeavyMetalPony> She looks like Chloe Moretz
<RobotPinkie> she's not even close to Mane 6, though
<Meanwhile> Fan interpretation made me think Trixies a douche
<Meanwhile> If she shows up in season 2 she has 5 minutes to make herself look like she isn't.
<stripes> she could be...
<RobotPinkie> lol
<RobotPinkie> I don't think she'll be in Season 2

Wasting no time in taking care of the potential Nightmare Moon reborn, Twilight smashed the filly into the wall over and over again, each impact staining the library wallpaper with blood, bits of fur and ejected organs spraying around the room. Nyx's eyes had been pleading at first, but as the repeated collisions gradually smashed her into a

For good measure, Twilight plucked the eyeballs from Nyx's skull last, smooshing them together in a blur of magic. "I don't know what I was thinking..." she muttered to herself. "Well, I'd better get someone to clean this up..." "Spiiiiiiike!"

<Gandalf> 4Shhhhhh
<Deadly_Pony> Its Thrusday
<herospirit> Get your head in the game, Phoenix!
<Agent_Smith> I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You're here because we need your help. We know that you've been contacted by a certain individual, a man who calls himself Gandalf. Now, whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.
<Elky> thanks deadly_pony
<Meanwhile> I'd watch the matrix if gandalf was in it
<Combustiblelemons> yosamity sam has clones?
<FrodoBaggins> Gandalf...where am I supposed to go? Mordor is so far and I don't know how to get to Mount Doom without getting murderballed.
<Legolas> 3THATS NOT A CHARGE YOU BASTARD
<Legolas> 3I DECLARE THE COURT IS CORRUPT
<Dumori> quick book him on assulte
<Agent_Smith> My colleagues believe that I'm wasting my time with you, but I believe you wish to do the right thing. We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start. And all that we're asking for in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
<Reaver21> Agent_Smith, You're on the wrong boat, methinks.
<Ersatz> OBJECTION!
<Meanwhile> Gandalf is known terrorist.
<Deadly_Pony> hahaha
