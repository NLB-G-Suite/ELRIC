<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ASoftFluffyThing: agreed
<AJIsAwesome> I never found that word acceptable, IMO. But again, this isn't the place.
<Panda> but SB, the "new" and "U" on your name... are they a reference to the "WiiU" or the "NewU" machine in borderlands that spawns you after you die?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The word isn't acceptable in this chat. No need to discuss it.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Okay, subject change time! Favorite fruit or vegetable?

<killerpony7733> ^
<Gold_Demona> ^^
<Jmo> Na.
<Jmo> Still isn't cool Robo

<AdamTheDuck> Obligatory image: http://i.imgur.com/I7kfw.jpg
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: It's actually been kinda mild lately. =/
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: 2 days ago a guy was complaining cause val was streaming Final Fantasy 10
<Jmo> Who the hell could complain about that.
<Jmo> Dafuq.
<Gold_Demona> At any rate I'm not seeing very many kicks/bans while I'm on
<Spectrum_Rush> wasn't it something about the logic of breathing underwater?
<Spectrum_Rush> actually nvm
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I think i had a temp ban at one point
<Spectrum_Rush> noone answer that
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, there was a ban a few hours ago, someone kept spamming >.>
<Jmo> flutterlove
<Jmo> >.>
<Gold_Demona> lol, Like I said. While I'm on. Guess things get quiet when I'm on. XP
<Bronysith> Wrek: how is Ze plushie?
<Bronysith> i just found a /mlp/ thread that will cause the wrath of the viking god here
<Wrek> 05just figured id practice soem human
<Wrek> 05its meh ^_^
<Wrek> 05as for the plushie
<Wrek> 05eez awesoem
<Wrek> 05she's having touble standing though xD
<RoboGerbil> no comment on that one
<Bronysith> what did you do with her? 0_0
<Bronysith> jk
<Gold_Demona> That's ok Wrek. I suck at humans too. :P
<Rommulus> hey all
<Gold_Demona> I have better luck with gargoyles, oddly enough. XP
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Rommulus
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Rommulus
<Wrek> 05one of her legs got a gap in the padding so the leg beds when applied weight to
<Wrek> 05nd*
<Rommulus> what are you drawing
<RoboGerbil> did you buy the plushie or make it?
<Wrek> 05practicing some human so im drawing an infiltrator
<RoboGerbil> cuz you could slide a wire hanger into the legs for added support
<Wrek> 05got it as a gift
<Rommulus> cool
<Bronysith> XD
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349939742313.png
<RoboGerbil> not aloe
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> is this from a game?
<AdamTheDuck> DeadpoolDash|GW2, Planetside 2 I think
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> was curious cause ME3 has a class with the same name
<Bronysith> and mass effect in general
<RoboGerbil> who talks about ME3 anymore?
<Bronysith> me
<RoboGerbil> hmm thought EA messed that one up too bad
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> ME3 multiplayer is pretty fun
<Bronysith> yes it is
<Bronysith> i always seem to get matched with retards though
<XAX> Ohgod im at the last episode of doctor who that has Rose in it :c
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> PC or console?
<Jmo> Want a tissue diddums?
<RoboGerbil> XAX: rose was best assistant
<XAX> RoboGerbil: Ikr ;_;
*Gold_Demona still like the ME series despite the shitty ending.
*Vivix belatedly thanks Gold_Demona for llama
<Gold_Demona> lol ^^
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the ME series was great until they dropped the ball with ME3, I blame EA
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<RoboGerbil> i prolly wont get ME3 till they drop origin
<Bronysith> EA is always to blame
<Gold_Demona> If you ignore the ending though, ME3 was an excellent game, IMO
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I can't believe they had Kal'Reegar die off screen
<Bronysith> EA is most likely the reason why the Ending to ME3 sucked
<Bronysith> "You guys have 1 year to make this game"
<Bronysith> "but sir it requires a minimum of 4" "I DONT WANT TO HEAR IT"
<Bronysith> NOW GET BACK TO WORK SLAVES
<Wrek> 05not from a game
<Wrek> 05making up as i go
<oGriofa> How do people use sai like this? I can never get my lines straight.
<oGriofa> Or to have that curvy look
<Bronysith> lots of practice most likely
<oGriofa> And maybe a tablet, i guess.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> that almost reminds me of a 40K model
<oGriofa> Anyways, hey everyone.
<Gold_Demona> In general I have a hard time getting smooth lines without making quick strokes
<AdamTheDuck> Hello oGriofa :P
<Gold_Demona> If I try to draw slow, my tablet makes wobbly lines. =I
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/t7dhU Wrek
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: Do you use tablet or mouse?
<Jmo> Wibbly wobbly timey wimey lines~
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: Wacom Bamboo tablet
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I always use lots of lines then erase and clean them up
<Gold_Demona> I don't like doing a lot of erasing cuz it takes away the smoothness.
<Gold_Demona> So I end up doing "quick stroke + undo" until I get the line I want
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: What would you suggest for a tablet, money isn't an isssue, I've been thinking about buying one, I'm good at freehand drawing so maybe i could do a tablet.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> yeah, that would drive me crazy
<Gold_Demona> Cuz stroking quickly is the only method I've found to make smooth non-wobbly lines
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> i would never get anything done
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: I honestly would recommend Wacom. I have pretty much the cheapest model they've got, so that might be most of my problem, but it's WAY the hell better than the cheapo-delux-brand tablet I was using before.
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: And how do those work, they just hook up to the computer right?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> yep
<Rommulus> If you are looking for a tablet I recommend the Intous 5
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> usb
<Jmo> LOL
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: Well yes, you can just plug it in and use it, but it works even better after you install the drivers. :P
<Gold_Demona> I can't afford an Intuos. :<
<Gold_Demona> That's why I have a Bamboo
<Vivix> I want an Intuos 4, because rubber tip...
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> I wish I had an Intuos
<Jmo> You and your rubber tip.
*Vivix kisses Jmo's fish
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the wacom works fine for the casual user
<Bronysith> FUCKING HELL Phoenix Wright Is such a great game series
<Vivix> I want that rubber so bad! The tablet I have now is like drawing with a ballpoint pen
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: I'd install the drivers first. I use alot of devices like that, but i have no tablet.
<Vivix> What's the difference between intuos 5 and 4 though? 4 is still more expensive around here
<Jmo> It's one digit higher.
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: Yeah, if money's not an issue, then I'd say go with Intuos
<Gold_Demona> The Wacon Intuos
<Gold_Demona> Wacom*
<Jmo> Wacon.
<Jmo> New tablet brand.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Vivix> hehe
<Jmo> That reminds me
<Gold_Demona> Wacom Knockoff brand from korea or something. :P
<Jmo> Demaa, when is new strip being made ;~;
<Vivix> No but Intuos5 has touch, right? But last time I saw it it was almost 200 dollars cheaper-
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: As soon as I stop being distracted by Pok?mon White 2. XD
<Jmo> Poop.
<oGriofa> Im going to cheak out some reveiws.
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/vg/src/1349176131445.jpg
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: It depends on what you get I think. Some have touch, and some don't I think. Personally I don't want one with touch.
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Wrek> 05who should i turn this sketch into
<Gold_Demona> Hey Wrek. Do you know about a site called Pose Maniacs?
<Wrek> 05and nope
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, what's that girl from Starcraft?
<AdamTheDuck> Kerrigan
<Gold_Demona> It's a really good site to practice the human form. LOTS of poses free to use as reference.
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: Im going for one that only lets you use the pen, my computer is already touchscreen, but its definatley not for drawing.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: posemaniacs.com in case you're interested.
<Rommulus> oGriofa: what is your intended price range.
<Vivix> I'd say intuos 4 then, but I'm guessing there are newer ones that also have no touch
<oGriofa> Rommulus: about 100 to 350, so im the range of good ones, i think thats reasonable from what ive seen.
<Bronysith> Wrek: Zero suit samus XD
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: I'd say eyeball a few different models and look at their features. Typically if they don't say "touch" then they don't have it.
<Bronysith> well ill see you mothertruckers later, going to go to school
<Vivix> Intuos 4 on kelkoo (price list in norway) XL costs 1000 dollars, dunno what a M or XL costs in other countries
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Bronysith
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: Yea, I like to rest my hand while I'm drawing, so id like one without it. :I
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: Same here
<Jmo> Most of the time you can turn off the touch.
*Gold_Demona has the Cintiq24X on her list of "Things I'm definitely buying when I win the lottery"
<Vivix> Hehehe
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: If i cant rest my hand i suck at drawing, I have muscle issues that make me shake.
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Typically though if there's a model that's exactly the same but without touch, it's cheaper
<Jmo> True, just saying though ;D
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I rest my hand all the time and havent had an issue
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> there is a sensor in the pen that the pad keeps track of
<oGriofa> Id have to ask a pro sai drawer about the settings they use to sketch and make fine art.
<killerpony7733> I have that mark on just under my wrists anyone who plays a sufficient amount of time on a PC
<Jmo> Ask Gold_Demona or Wrek.
<Rommulus> Ask Wrek?
<Gold_Demona> I don't use Sai
<Gold_Demona> I use Photoshop
<Jmo> Are you cereal
<Jmo> <..<
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I use Paint.net
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> cause its free
<Jmo> Only pros use MSPaint
<Jmo> :>
<oGriofa> is wrek the one streaming, just making sure.
<killerpony7733> oGriofa Yep
<Gold_Demona> Paint.net isn't flexible enough for me. =/
<Rommulus> Yes Wrek is streaming
<Vivix> I like sai, but there's no 'god skills' setting
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> you have to download the user made stuff
<Gold_Demona> god skills setting?
<Vivix> I didn't like paint.net because none of my shortcuts working
<oGriofa> Vivix: God skills? :I sorry im new to this. Ive always drawn on paper.
<Vivix> You know, a lot of people look for that one setting in art program that makes their drawings instantly good
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> tons of content packs out there to make it user friendly and add features
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Never heard of that
<oGriofa> Vivix: Oh i see, thats dirty.
<Vivix> Sai is pretty good on lines and souch out of the box, so to speak, but--settings overall are just preference, so I wouldn't advice asking anyone about anything but practical, like binary line vs not binary
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona:Maybe because they want it a secret.
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: LOL maybe
<Vivix> Hehe
<oGriofa> Dat accidental link
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I cant justify spending $999.99 on a piece of software for what I would use it for
<Vivix> Photoshop? Yeah
<Vivix> It's intended use gives it a hefty pricetag
<oGriofa> Photoshop is one of the few things out of my price range.
<Vivix> I liked Painter 11 when I tried it
<Vivix> around..500 bucks
<Wrek> 05hows it looking so far? :|
<Vivix> but~~ I couldn't get the oils and such to work the way that I wanted, so the functions I were left with weren't better than Sai
<AdamTheDuck> Elegant :3
<oGriofa> I've decided to go with sai because i got it free from some /b/ronies.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> good so far wrek
<Vivix> Sai costs 70 bucks, buy it or don't use it
<Jmo> Lookin' good Wrek
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: Yeah... Photoshop is the only software I allow myself to pirate because the price is ridiculous
<Jmo> PIIRAATE~
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: Where do you even pirate that? I can never find it.
<oGriofa> Gold_Demona: I guess ive never tried..
<Gold_Demona> oGriofa: torrents
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I used to pirate it, but the online part has kept me from doing that with the newer versions
<Jmo> ima buttpirate.
<oGriofa> Jmo: No.
<Gold_Demona> DeadpoolDash|GW2: That's why I never use the online part.
<Vivix> I stopped pirating the day I could afford things, still can't afford adobe software though
<Jmo> Oi I am what I wanna be.
<Vivix> Then again, I don't need that grade of software now adays~-
<oGriofa> Alright guys, going to school, talk to you tonight.
<Gold_Demona> laters
*Vivix waves
<AdamTheDuck> Bye oGriofa
<Rommulus> Bye Gold_Demona
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I think the newest ones check with their master server to authenticate it
<Rommulus> woops wrong person
<Gold_Demona> Rommulus: I'm not leaving. O_o
<Rommulus> bye oGriofa
<Jmo> DON'T LEAVE US Gold_Demona ;~;
<Jmo> The horror.
<Vivix> If I want to run Cubase 6, I have to put in a usb dongle that is authenticated online, like a key
<Rommulus> Saw your post before I saw oGriofa's XD
<Vivix> Anti Piracy that don't murder you <3

<ofna01> not humens
<ofna01> hoomens
<Vivix> Look, it's a group of menhoos
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> he draws ponies like humans, so drawing humans should be easy for him
<Rommulus> Wrek draws Hue-mans
<Vivix> that are manwos
<ofna01> as Tobuscus would say
<ofna01> hothothothot
<Gold_Demona> It's humens!
<Gold_Demona> Combines hate humens
<ofna01> Hoomens is spy?
<Gold_Demona> Combines are from science and outer space and hate humens. D:

<MadSurge> Saturn: You mean attention deficit? Maybe
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: It's October 10, I can't be wrong
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: It's October 11th

<MecidTheGermanBrony> I really like her mane
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: this show revived the art of pastry :D
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everyone! :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello RaveBrony
<Gold_Demona> Mmmm pastry
<Ponies47> Ello RaveBrony :3
*MecidTheGermanBrony helps AdamTheDuck with homework
<MadSurge> Hey RaveBrony!
<Snow> homework?
<doughnutjoe> Ravebrony i heard you like raves
<Snow> did someone said homework!?
<Gold_Demona> :O
<AdamTheDuck> Yes Snow, good ol' slab of maths homework.
<RaveBrony> doughnutjoe: Guilty :3
<Ponies47> Ewwwww math homework
<Snow> HOOOOOOOOMEWOOOORK! HOOOOOOOOOOOOOMEWOOOOOOOOOOOORK!
<doughnutjoe> Ravebrony :D I have never been to a rave! Are they fun?
*Gold_Demona has also never been to a rave... or any dance club thing for that matter...
<MecidTheGermanBrony> We're roleplaying
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, may I ask if you have tried one of these clubs out? I mean, a friend of mine is in an archery club, and that seemed very interesting.
*MadSurge clubs, but only with metalhead friends :D
<doughnutjoe> the closest ive ever been to a rave was DDR :D
*MecidTheGermanBrony drinks lipton
*doughnutjoe drinks nestea
<ofna01> Adam, i want to do Archery, but i have a stress problem, so i'm homeschooled
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: No I haven't. Nor do I want to. I see no point in after school activates so I don't do any of them.
<Snow> archery is awsome
<Snow> i do that and swordfighting
<Snow> relieves stress so much =D
<Ponies47> I also don't go watch the games for the football teams and such
<Ponies47> I could care less about that
<AdamTheDuck> Me neither, I don't really like to spectate sport
<doughnutjoe> Snow i can do all that with my ps3 :D
<Snow> try doing it IRL
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<ofna01> Snow, those are 2 things i've wanted to do since i was little
<AdamTheDuck> But yes, being active in it is fun.
<doughnutjoe> Does the sword have a glowing pink ball on it? :D
<ofna01> I tried archery on a field trip i went on, i was the best there
<Snow> ehm....no
<Cypresswolf> :3 who wasn't here last night - any newcomers?
<Snow> they are real steel swords
<ofna01> are they sharp?
<RaveBrony> doughnutjoe: Sorry was watching the linked vid. But yes, raves are very fun :D
<Snow> kind of
<Gold_Demona> Is this fencing you're talking about?
<Snow> but we must be protected
<doughnutjoe> Ravebrony thanks
<Gold_Demona> With the foils and such?
<Snow> no, not poking each other with stick-i mean fencing
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Snow> its not that
<Snow> i mean real swords with real armour
<Snow> its REALY heavy
<doughnutjoe> Snow you're a knight? :O
<ofna01> basically, LARPING
<Snow> if you say it that way
<doughnutjoe> BEHOLD Snow! KNIGHT OF CELESTIA!
<Gold_Demona> I've never heard of a school that taught ACTUAL sword fighting. That's interesting/ O_o
*Snow is a unicorn
<Snow> a knight? ok....
<Cypresswolf> :) Just for today, if anyone says they're new here, share this with them http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cG_PDCFncE - And tell me their reactions when I return :D
*Ponies47 Doesn't like trying new things
<AdamTheDuck> May I ask why they're so concerned Ponies47? You do have friends at school right? (intended to be said in the kindest way possible :/ )
<Snow> its not in school actually
<doughnutjoe> BEHOLD Snow! UNICORN KNIGHT OF CELESTIA!
<Snow> its after school
<Gold_Demona> Snow: I count them as one and the same cuz you're learning it AT the school
<Cypresswolf> I've given you all a little spark of madness, dont lose it :)
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> silly Jon Snow, go play with your wolf beyond the wall in the black
<Snow> then yes, some schools teach that
<ofna01> Snow, if i could, i would duel you
<MadSurge> YESH, I love Dumbo! :$
<AdamTheDuck> Cypresswolf, dat quote /)
<Cypresswolf> AdamTheDuck: (\
<ofna01> I like to do that kind of stuff, i still have my old nerf swords xD
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: No I don't have any friends IRL. I'm acting how Twilight did in the first episode but insted of books it's computer
<doughnutjoe> the closest ive ever gotten to being a knight was playing with a broom stick :|
<Snow> ofnai01: you can try, but im quite good at it
<Vivix> Did somepony say unicorn? http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/266/2/8/faux_foal__ayre_by_indigo_ocean-d2zc7vc.jpg
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: I love Pink Elephants On Parade! :D
<Snow> vivix: yes, but not that unicorn
<Ponies47> Cypresswolf: HA! :D

<Snow> http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/b/b5/Saxton_Hale_killingsomeone05.wav
<Barbetos> Scout probably felt awesome dieing to those fists.
<Kammerjunk> I hear being Hale with only one Scout left is the eleventh layer of Hell.
<Barbetos> Oh yeah?
<Snow> especially if its a scout
<ofna01> Snow, where do you find the Dominated lines?
<Snow> with a bfb, flying guillotine and sandman
<Barbetos> I heard it was being a midget, overweight, italian plumber who has to rescue a princess over and over and over and over....
<Kammerjunk> Gunpowder, gelatine. Dynamite with a laser beam.
<Barbetos> From a over sized fire breathing lizard.
<Barbetos> Analogy for satan maybe?
<Barbetos> You decide!
<Snow> ofna01 at the same thing, but at the end of the page, there is voice command lines and responces
<Kammerjunk> Barbetos: You have to admit, though, that Mario is very qualified.
<Snow> Barbetos: http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/4/42/Saxton_Hale_killingspree02.wav
<Kammerjunk> Qualified for everything.

<Barbetos> Kammerjunk well Mario is a masochist I am pretty sure. Hell the poor guy goes on vacation and STILL manages to rescue a princess.
<Barbetos> From another midget no less
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, he's definitely a masochist.
<Snow> ahem scout?
<ofna01> http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/2/2e/Scout_domination13.wav
<Snow> scout?
<ofna01> Yeah?
<Snow> http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/c/c7/Spy_DominationScout06.wav
<Barbetos> how much time have you spent playing scout?
<Barbetos> I have over 150 hours on medic. So many PUG matches. <<
<ofna01> 100+
<Kammerjunk> I used to play Scout a lot.
<ofna01> out of my 350 hours
<Kammerjunk> But then I found out just how fun the airblast is.
<ofna01> D:<
<Barbetos> Kammerjunk air blast? Try flaring soldiers out of the air
<Barbetos> I played with some crazy good puggers in my time.
<Barbetos> My god.
<Kammerjunk> I use the Degreaser, Detonator and Extinguisher.
*ofna01 beats Snow to death with bat

<Barbetos> I want to get that movie shown on here for a BMN
<Barbetos> I have never seen it
<ofna01> RIP Shwiggan
<Barbetos> Huh?
<Kammerjunk> Shwiggan is a pretty cool guy.
<ofna01> He's not doing vids anymore as far as I know
<Barbetos> His last one was a week ago
<Barbetos> So that must be recent
<Kammerjunk> Also, Charlie Chaplin is the man.
<ofna01> http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/d/dd/Scout_misc05.wav
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I didn't even notice he made a new video.
*ofna01 stands up and claps loudly and whistles
<Snow> at scout: http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/3/35/Soldier_taunts12.wav
<Kammerjunk> So I got halfway through the Dictator video, but then YouTube was all "nope.avi" in my face.
<diddutz> Kammerjunk: youtube or Flash Player?
<Kammerjunk> YouTube. The "Do you want to use your full name?" thing popped up and stopped the video.
<diddutz> never got that message
<Snow> Kammerjunk: you mean like this? http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/b/bd/Engineer_no01.wav
<ofna01> nope.wav
<Kammerjunk> Just so.
<Barbetos> This is really random, so sorry. I find it funny that one of the pins on my CPU broke. I finally end up over clocking it and my computer is MORE stable than it was at stock.
<Barbetos> XD

<Kammerjunk> I have never overclocked anything.
<Barbetos> I hope Shwigzero never goes to machina. That would kill his awesome videos, like so many before it.
<Kammerjunk> It would.
<Snow> http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/2/2c/Engineer_negativevocalization12.wav
<Snow> why dismissed?
<Barbetos> Machina was great in the begining, but now its an oversaturated mess.
<ofna01> http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/d/d9/Scout_laughlong01.wav
<Barbetos> Also MONEY

<Vivix> maaybe...
<Vivix> >.>
<Vivix> ;__;
<Vivix> Have you ever touched a sheep?

<Jmo> Hehehe class
<Jmo> Suckers
<RaveBrony> Ugh, ill bbl, lol.
<Kammerjunk> To be honest, I'm not even much for the wood taste.
<Vivix> I did suck on coins at some point, but Coppery always tasted weird to me
<Jmo> .____.
<Kammerjunk> Really? I think metal tastes great.
*Vivix was an adhd kid, that has to be said
<Vivix> Well some of it- I guess
*Jmo flips table
<Barbetos|AtWork> Kammerjunk: go lick ironman
<Kammerjunk> Something wrong, Jmo?
<Jmo> Y'all strange.
<Vivix> like well pure copper tastes nice, but you knwo that strange mix that a lot have? That either tastes nothing, or really chemical
<Jmo> Sucking on coins, chewing on chairs/tables.

<Kammerjunk> Iron does taste pretty good.
<Jmo> >__>
<Jmo> You scary browniestaet.
<Vivix> hehe
<Jmo> You got a say in this Gold_Demona?
<Kammerjunk> On a some-related note, I love sucking on an open wound.
<Kammerjunk> Love that metallic taste.
<Vivix> Jmo was a normal kid ;__; while I ate scissors and ran around pretending to be a dinosaur
<Snow> says the person who slaps everyone with a trout >.>
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I stopped paying attention. o_o
<Jmo> ;__;
<Gold_Demona> What're we talking about?
<Jmo> They eat materials!
<Vivix> Well if the wound isn't too big, it's kinda soothing
<Kammerjunk> Gold_Demona: Sucking on metal and wood and stuff.
<Jmo> Wood, metal, iron, wool!
<Jmo> my god!
<Gold_Demona> Eww

<Jmo> wut.
<Vivix> <,<
<Snow> dont hate me for it, but i realy like the taste of blood ._.
<Gold_Demona> I don't think I have much to say here. :P
*Mega_Milk walks in chat sees the phrase "Suck on wood" Walks out of chat...
<Vivix> It is pleasing to many-
<Kammerjunk> Snow: Yeah, me too.
<Vivix> I don't like the fact that it is blood, but it doesn't taste bad
<Kammerjunk> Mega_Milk: Welcome to! We're talking about sucking on and/or chewing materials!
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: -lol I used to chew on belts but that was about it.
<Vivix> Belts, leather belts never--I did chew on it
<Schocke> FINALLY!!!
<Mega_Milk> The tough leather felt good against ma teeth :/
<Vivix> but, leather tastes wonky, like blech
<Mega_Milk> i didnt chew for the taste. Just the texture.

<Kammerjunk> Well, welcome out of the hospital then!
<Jmo> Did you suck on battery acid?

<Vivix> <,<
<Kammerjunk> Wipe the harddsk.

<Wrek> 05there was this random dude that knocked on the door before i left
<Vivix> Creepyguy
<Jmo> The hobo that wanted your plushie.
<Wrek> 05he mumbled a name and a company and directly asked to come inside
<Vivix> The hobo with sheep hair
<Jmo> ^
<Wrek> 05i told him no and locked the door
<Wrek> 05readying my axe
<Kammerjunk> If they ain't invited, they ain't coming in.
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: Smart man.
<Gold_Demona> Ah yeah, I remember you mentioned him earlier Wrek
<Vivix> yeah
<Jmo> Suddenly Gold_Demona.

<Jmo> ~shazam~
<Wrek> 05police on the road downhill
<Gold_Demona> Did I ninja you Jmo. :P
<Wrek> 05i wonder if coincidence
<Lil_B> Retro City Rampage is so awesome >.<
<Wrek> 05so!
<Wrek> 05still no stream?
<Vivix> You don't have police on twitter or policeradio?
<Jmo> Na, you've just been so uiet.
<Jmo> Till now.
<Kammerjunk> Eenope.
<Wrek> 05then i can continue
<Jmo> quiet*
<Wrek> 05where i left of
<Vivix> (For some reason, police here has twitter, and put up random updates like that)
<Wrek> 05untill sumi si ready to ps2
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I had a dream that I met someone at the door...I too told him my name, but they wouldn't let me in...
<Vivix> Was taht your nightmare?
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: That doesn't sound very effective.
<Vivix> Well, it's just for small tidbits of info
<Lil_B> the music that playes during the Biffman chase (Batman Parody) is a really really hidden 60's Batman Theme xD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No, I only kid ><
<Vivix> Hehe
<Mega_Milk> The worst nightmare I ever had was just a falling dream.
<Wrek> 05gona continue on this drawing <3
<Gold_Demona> heh. Stream literally picks up where it left off
<Vivix> All actualy police stuff go over their internal communication, but thigns like "Hey, the fire is out" or "Situation is fine, suspect apprehended" goes on twitter
<Lil_B> I was drowning after beeing chased by a Rock
<Rainbow> Russian knows someone here
<Mega_Milk> I feel off a big tower of boxes and just kept falling forever.
<Rainbow> ?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02My dream was just weird -~-
<Mega_Milk> fell*
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Don't remember it exactly though
<Vivix> I had a dream once, that I was looking at my own shadow, and it got more and more demony-
<Vivix> everytime I tried to wake up, it got worse ;__;
<Wrek> 05i know its not ponies
<Vivix> The worst dreams, well, not WORST, are the ones where you buy something, or get something, and wake up totally disappointed that you no longer have it
<Wrek> 05but i hope you'll enjoy any ways
<Jmo> I wouldn't agree.
*Vivix strokes Jmo's face
<Mega_Milk> A wise Wrek once told me. Too much pony killed the brony.
<Jmo> >.>
<Jmo> MAH FACE.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Vivix: Wii U ;^;
<Vivix> I once dreamt I got a crybaby wah, ( I was 15) and I got up and looked for it
<Vivix> You dreamt about that? Ooh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No o.o
<Gold_Demona> The dreams I can't stand are the ones where your voice refuses to work, and if you actually put the effort to MAKE it work, you wake up actually saying it in real life.
<Jmo> Damn you're bad at the guessing game veeveex.
<Vivix> It's--the weirdest dreams- cause that tiny moment before you are fully awake, you're convinced you have it
<Kammerjunk> I dreamt, I guess. I don't really know what.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I did dream a few weeks ago about the Wii U though ><
<Vivix> Jmo I haven't slept for ...20 hours ;__;
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02About having one
<Jmo> EXCUSES
<Jmo> Your own fault >.>
<Vivix> Ah yeah, that's what I meant to ask, I'm not good at speek today
<Vivix> ;__;
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02;~;
<Snow> if i dream something that can realy happen that will happen to me
<Jmo> how2speek

<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: I have had that happen to me a loooong time ago when I was in highschool -lol I fell asleep at my desk and was trying to speak in my dream but couldnt so I tried and tried and eventually yelled and I actually yelled outloud and woke myself up and everyone looked at me -lol
<Wrek> 05showed some of m y work
<Wrek> 05she'd read about the min the newspaper
<Wrek> 05(my job coach)
<Gold_Demona> How'd it go Wrek?
<Kammerjunk> I assume she had read something completely different than how it is.
<Vivix> Oh dreams where you are trying to do stuff is weeird- falling asleep in public is..emberassing enouh without jerking around mumbling stuff
<Vivix> I once fell asleep in group therapy- noone said a word when I woke up
<Kammerjunk> Because a newspaper doesn't sell if it says that everything's alright.
<Vivix> Depends on the paper, some papers like to do happynews
<Vivix> where everything is super
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> naked drawing is naked
<Wrek> 05it went well <3
<Kammerjunk> I want to see a paper with only the text "HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY". No content, no pictures, just that.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Vivix> Most of the brony stuff in Norwegian news I've seen have been positive
<Vivix> like inquisitive, misinformed, but happy
<Gold_Demona> Kammerjunk: Just a headline and that's it?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Walmart and target ew
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<Gold_Demona> That'd be funny

<Hoody|School> ello many peoples
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Hoody|School

<DashWithRainbows> Damn it, I can't remember what it is from but I know that I've heard it quite a few times before.
<Hoody|School> HOLY CRAP PEOPLE
<Dken2021> allo HoodyNinja
<Dken2021> hm?
<DashWithRainbows> We're not people made out of crap nor are we holy.
<DashWithRainbows> >:l
<Cades> You have an irc program?
<Stormy`> yeah
<Hoody|School> DashWithRainbows: Technicality!
<Cades> which one?
<Stormy`> I used to use a lot of other channels besides this one
<Stormy`> icechat
<Cades> ok
<Stormy`> No one ever knows what it is, but it works okay and it was the first one I found
<Stormy`> so I'm used to it

*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Cades> hey
<Stormy`> The UI is kind of ugly until you customize it
<Stormy`> Hey Kimori
<Wrek> 05madness combat
<Kimori> hii
<DashWithRainbows> Ah.
<DashWithRainbows> Never would've though of that, I was thinking of something completely different.
<Jmo> Go listen to your Bieber DWR.
<DashWithRainbows> Hey.
<DashWithRainbows> It's not Bieber
<DashWithRainbows> It's Miley Cyrus >:l
<Gold_Demona> wubs
<Jmo> You'd know.
<Jmo> ROfl
<Snow> she cleans them
<Snow> with wubs
<Hoody|School> The only way to clean dishes
<Cades> I kinda wanna find another irc I can go on when things are going slowly here
*MecidTheGermanBrony slaps Jmo with baseball bat
<DashWithRainbows> Oh man, I love this song when I'm hero on PF2
<Kimori> Theres a ton of em out there
<Stormy`> do you just go through spyrochat.com?
<Snow> well it seems
<Cades> yeah
<Snow> the dishes got wubbed clean
<Stormy`> mibbit itself used to be a pretty good web-based client
<Stormy`> But then it removed epic-chat from the list...
<Snow> (im not good at that joke)
<DashWithRainbows> Still not as clean if SaxyJanitor done them.
<Cades> :/
<Kimori> why?
<Stormy`> No one knows
<Stormy`> Aristeo didn't even know
<Stormy`> it just disappeared one day
<Kimori> Theres no way to request it to be readded?
<Stormy`> there might be
<Stormy`> I guess he didn't bother for whatever reason
<Kimori> aww
<Wrek> 05gotta turn autoplay off
<Snow> heavykhin
<Snow> seems legit
<Hoody|School> ^
<Cades> Could you email them or something?
<Snow> 20% cooler =D
<Stormy`> well I'd have to track down Aristeo and see what he has to say about it
<Hoody|School> I've heard this song too many times
<Stormy`> My guess is Mibbit probably requires a certain size to be on their list
<Stormy`> and we're too small
<Cades> yeah maybe
<Stormy`> Maybe we fell just below their threshold when they removed us
<Stormy`> Now we're way too small though XD
<Snow> i found another brony at my college because of this song: he was beatboxing this
<Cades> yeah haha
<Dken2021> interesting
<Hoody|School> Was his name god?
<Stormy`> 9 channels where people can actually talk
<Stormy`> and I'll guess like 15 users total online right now
<Hoody|School> Because I don't think anyone can beatbox this
<Snow> not everything at the same time ofc...
<Cades> epic chat is only 9 channels?
<Dken2021> there's a disabled girl I know that could beatbox this
<Stormy`> technically there are 11
<Stormy`> but I didn't count the ones that aren't meant for people to talk in
<Dken2021> probably
<Stormy`> like #services and #bopm
<Hoody|School> I can eat cereal
<Cades> I never realized is was that small haha
<Stormy`> well I guess if you count all the log channels there would be 14
<Stormy`> and #staff-opers would make 15
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://derpy.me/okYqk
<Stormy`> Yeah, it used to be quite a bit bigger
<Snow> likely story
<Stormy`> if you do /list you can see all the channels that aren't private and how many people are in them
<Hoody|School> F*cking school internet
<Barbetos|AtWork> intertubes.
<Barbetos|AtWork> You mean.
<Cades> oh ok
<MadSurge> Dat Catgroove!
<Stormy`> I think mibbit lets you do that...
<Snow> inb4 my head full of derping pony heads
<Ponies47|School> So bored ;_;
<Hoody|School> Ponies47|School: School buddies!
<Cades> guess it doesnt work on phones
<Saturn> 08,01my little dried fruit: prunes are delicious
<MadSurge> Snow: more like a spinning sixties' Spiderman
*Saturn 08,01thinks he might be addicted to prunes
<Dken2021> Barbetos|AtWork , try putting in "YOUR MOTHER" to that guy in dewford town
<Stormy`> it might be some limitation of spyrochat.com/mibbit also
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: What does a prune taste like?
<MadSurge> Saturn: mmm, dried prunes
<Hoody|School> Saturn: You might need to get your taste buds checked
<Gold_Demona> Saturn: Prune juice is a warrior's drink.
<Stormy`> it's been a while since I've used that so I can't remember what works and doesn't work
<Ponies47|School> Hoody|School: School stinks. :<
<Saturn> 08,01Mega_Milk: imagine a plum, but not gross
<Cades> oh
<Dken2021> prunes? eh, I would prefer white cranberry
<Barbetos|AtWork> Word
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: But I liek plums....;^;
<Stormy`> SR said in #epic-chat yesterday that he's surprised this server is still even up
<Hoody|School> Plums are the fruit of the gods
<Stormy`> Because he stopped paying the bills like 8 months ago
<Mega_Milk> ^
<Barbetos|AtWork> Imagine plums but better
<Gold_Demona> Plums are not gross. D:<
<Saturn> 08,01Mega_Milk: you be wrong in the head, son
<Wrek> 05Saturn!
<Wrek> 05check stream
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek!
<Wrek> 05drawing chicks
<Barbetos|AtWork> with dicks
<Barbetos|AtWork> ZING
<Cades> oh wow
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: http://fav.me/d5a752j
<Hoody|School> Barbetos|AtWork: -_-
<Saturn> 08,01oooooo
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh you laughed. Don't deny
<Saturn> 08,01nice, wrek
<Hoody|School> -_-
<Kimori> o.o
<Kimori> damn, that means this place could disappear anytime?
<Barbetos|AtWork> somuchumadwatdowit?
<Stormy`> Sounds that way :(
<Kimori> We need a backup server
<Cades> thats kinda scary
<Hoody|School> This computer is quiet as hell...
<Ponies47|School> I'm kind of nervous being on ponychat at school.
<Hoody|School> Ponies47|School: I have da volume at full
<Stormy`> Good idea
<Kimori> I have another irc server we can go to
<Kammerjunk> How come, Ponies47|School?
<Hoody|School> Shit, gotta go, l8rs
<Stormy`> what server?
<Barbetos|AtWork> everyone, ping Hoody|School
<Kimori> I know the admin of the place too, I'm sure hed let me add a channel there
<DashWithRainbows> Because I'd want to embarrass him.
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Hoody|School.
<Kimori> Its not on any irc list
*Stormy` hopes it's not darchoods
<Kimori> no
<Stormy`> We tried to merge with them once and it went pretty badly XD
<Snow|Editing> looking amazing so far
<Ponies47|School> What's on stream?
<Kimori> If we need some backup plan for the channel, I can work on that
<Ponies47|School> I'm not watching
<Kimori> But I don't know how many here would be going to the new channel
<Kammerjunk> Wrek be drawin'.
<Ponies47|School> Ah
<Stormy`> We could always talk to SR and see if he can change the spyrochat.com widget to point to a different network
<Stormy`> then everyone who uses sc.com would just go there by default
<Ponies47|School> Well gotta dash
<Ponies47|School> Laters
<Stormy`> Could leave a message here in the topic as wel
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: plums are deliscious.....http://derpy.me/D2u42
<Kimori> What would SR's thoughts be if we did that though?
<Stormy`> Not sure
<Kimori> I don't really want to start making some other channel copy without him knowing
<Stormy`> Oh we'd have to talk to him first for sure
<Stormy`> Don't tell anyone I said this but he'd probaby flip out if we didn't :P
<Kimori> But then again I really don't want everyone to not know where to go
<Wrek> 05PengWin: i knwo you are here! >:D
<PengWin> HAI WREK
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Kimori> As soon as we get the ok on it ill start working on getting the new channel made in the other irc server
<Cades> We'll make sure everyone knows before we do i
<Kimori> Yeah
<Dark92Enigma> Isn't that the blonde chick from ATLANTIS? I'm back
<Stormy`> I would guess he probably wouldn't mind since it sounds like he doesn't really care about this network anymore
<Stormy`> but he'll probably have some network suggestions of his own
<Kimori> maybe
<Stormy`> and we might have to remind him a couple hundred times before he actually changes spyrochat.com
<Dark92Enigma> chat is quiet
<Dark92Enigma> ECHO!
<Cades> haha
<Dark92Enigma> Woooooooooo!
<Gold_Demona> We're mesmorized by Wrek's drawing. :3
<Kimori> :/
<Kimori> When we actually make the move
<Kimori> ill just have the new link on the topic and nothing else
<Snow|Editing> huh what? i wasnt paying attention to the chat, too busy watching *drool*
<Cades> So are we gonna change the location of this place, or keep it here and make a new one?
<Kimori> change the location
<Cades> k
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Dis chat so silly :D
<Jmo> o_O
<Cades> if anything goes wrong, just message me through spyroforum or youtube or something
<Wrek> 05this is definetly one of my top techno songs
<Stormy`> It should be fine
<Wrek> 05enjoy!
<Stormy`> Making new channels is pretty easy
<Kimori> But how are you going to get to the new irc channel?
<Kimori> Your using spyrochat.com right?
<Cades> yeah
<Kimori> I dont think it allows you to go somewhere else
*Gold_Demona bops head to music
<Stormy`> It doesn't; you'll have to get a client until sc.com gets changed
<Stormy`> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients
<Stormy`> I used to use chatzilla; I remember it being really quick to install and easy to use
<Cades> yeah I'll figure it out when I get home
<Stormy`> we might not even need to move for sure though
<Stormy`> maybe when we talk to SR he'll decide to start paying the bills again
<Stormy`> or something
<Wrek> 05atleast Gold_Demona appreciates it ^_^
<Stormy`> Or maybe he literally only meant one of the servers and the other two are still fine
<Gold_Demona> Indeed I do. :3
*Mega_Milk Aprreciates the music
<Stormy`> Not sure which ones he actually paid for
<Kimori> If hes on today, lets talk to him about it
<Stormy`> yeah
<Pink3> O_O I just got on this and look what i get
<Kimori> I'm going to talk to the admin on the other irc server I go to and see if its ok to setup a channel there
<Dken2021> what's wrong Pink3 ?
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek Bah, sorry mate, doing homework so I had to mute the stream.
<Pink3> Dat Virginia (you know what i mean) And by the way who is streaming?
<Stormy`> You can't just make the channel?
<Jmo> DWR pls
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I am ALWAYS mesmerized :D
<Pink3> Twas zoomed in earlier :)
<Stormy`> I thought most IRC admins encouraged new channels
<DashWithRainbows> Joomay nu thanks
<Stormy`> maybe that's just epic-chat...
<Jmo> :<
<Pink3> Is Wrek Streaming?
<Jmo> Yap
<Stormy`> admittedly I haven't been to many other networks

<Kimori> Well the irc server I go to is sort of private
<Stormy`> http://searchirc.com/
<Pink3> :{
<Kimori> the admin is a friend of mine and runs the place
<Stormy`> Ah
<Kimori> I would rather ask him before I do anything
<Kimori> I'm sure he would give me the ok but id rather find out first
*Gold_Demona arranges the blocks
<Pink3> Play the Pewdiepie song
<Jmo> >_>

<Panda> Bronystate>Class>homework

<Stormy`> Do we want to keep it small like this, or move somewhere bigger and try to get more traffic in here?
<Kimori> The admin I'm trying to talk to runs a Nintendo channel

<Sumica> 00,10I think it just laughed at me too
<Kandarihu> Looking good again.
<Lil_B> oh ... how can I not rekocnise a Phrase like BSOD because one letter was lower case >.<
<Sumica> 00,10it's supposed to be that way Lil_B
<Lil_B> I know :/
<Sumica> 00,10short words in acronyms such as "to" "of" and "it" are not capotlised.
<Kandarihu> Whenever I type out acronyms, I only capitalize it like it were a title
<Kandarihu> What Sumica said.
<prince-dari> Since when do you care about writing things correctly Sumica? :P
<Sumica> 00,10who said I care?
<Mega_Milk> ^
<Jmo> lul
<prince-dari> Well the fact that you bothered to explain it kind of implies.
<Sumica> 00,10nah i just know it dont meen i use it
<Sumica> 00,10one might say I could care less
<Mega_Milk> yaeh dug!
<Lil_B> btw prince-dari , I have a question, you said you don't like the "I could care less "Part in this day aria right?
<prince-dari> I hate it, correct.
*Sumica cetches some popcorn and a folding chair
<Sumica> 00,10dis gonna be good
<Lil_B> it's just that I hear it everywhere is it just generally wrong or is it just that you don't like it?
<Sumica> 00,10exactly dari
<prince-dari> The phrasing isn't wrong, but the meaning people think it has is.
<Sumica> 00,10it's a phrase that is in a transisin
<prince-dari> 'I could care less' means that you care an unspecified amount.
<Stormy`> I have to go to work for an hour
<Sumica> 00,10people are forceing the defenition to be changed via miss use
<prince-dari> When what they mean to say it "I could not care less", in other words, they don't care at all.
<Blako> oh hi all :D
<Stormy`> see you guys
<Kimori> cya
<Blako> cya
<prince-dari> 'I could care less' could mean anything EXCEPT what they intend it to mean.
<prince-dari> They could care any amount, apart from not at all.
<Kammerjunk> I don't get the saying either.
<prince-dari> Because the phrase itself means they care somewhat.
<DashWithRainbows> wut
<Sumica> 00,10I could care less, but that would require effort
<DashWithRainbows> I look at chat
<Lil_B> ok :/ It messes with the heads of people who have to leartn the english language :/

<Jmo> Pokemon lost its appeal after Gen 3 for me
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: Same.

<RaveBrony> Exactly
<Jmo> ehh remakes

<Jmo> Just isn't the same :<
<SpadeMagnes[School> Just gotta keep Genesect away from fire types
<linx> havent played past platinum
<RaveBrony> Got rid of the pervy old man? Do not want :D
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: HeartGold isn't just a remake. It's an improvement

<Mega_Milk> Wrek: Yeah except ASoftFluffyThing cause her headphones hate her.
<Gold_Demona> It was funny
<Gold_Demona> And pathetic on our part
<Blako> but one was an exception - in some beta releasse I met one kind creeper that didn't attack me and just looked around like animals :) I took screenshot with him
<VenHur> I don't know...I find it unintrested...

<Wrek> 05http://screensnapr.com/v/1XOFMg.png
<Wrek> 05WIP
<Kandarihu> Oh boy. This episode.
<Stormy`> But Kimori and Cades and I were talking about moving the channel earlier
<Bronysith> Wrek: infiltrator tomorrow
<Applejack2012> cya
<Gold_Demona> I think Imma head out for the day.
<RedDragonX> who said you could talk
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: All dat junk in her trunk :P
<Gold_Demona> See y'all tomorrow Bronystate
<Kandarihu> Nice, Wrek

<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Later kid.
<Sumica> 00,10it's to hold extra clips Mega_Milk
<Wrek> 05Mega_Milk: i prefer a gal with something to grab than skin and bones
<RedDragonX> :P
<Bronysith> Wrek: IKR
<Gold_Demona> So a woman with a spare tire?
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: Your speaking my language sir.
<Blako> would it be hard to move it?
<Wrek> 05Gold_Demona: maybe
<RedDragonX> no
<Stormy`> Nope, we'd just have to agree on a new network and make a new channel on it
<Gold_Demona> Ok, later all
<alexxm> thing is if you don't feel pain you'll still get hurt you just wouldn't know it
<VenHur> ...Oh, that son of a...
<Wrek> 05right i was gona sleep
<Blako> I have no problem with it, just remember telling me where to find it :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> this channel?
<Stormy`> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10it's no longer self defence if you reload
<VenHur> ...This is getting good...it might not be so bad after all...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> whats wrong with this network lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its not like we get 1000 people in here
<Wrek> 05Sumica: not even if all the first shots miss?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> what did you decide?
<Sumica> 00,10he put 12 round in to this guy wrek
<Bronysith> Sumica: this is true
<Wrek> 05i meant generally
<Wrek> 05im not watchign stream
<Invi> he should have done the same like they did with robocop
<Sumica> 00,10if you miss yeah
<Stormy`> We just thought since like you said the bills aren't being paid for the servers anymore it might be better to move somewhere more stable
<Sumica> 00,10but he did't
<Stormy`> We haven't decided a network
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> actually what happened was, the vps provider where this is hosted gave me a big credit for some downtime
<Stormy`> Also this network is dead so it's not like it's doing us any favors to be here
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so its been living off the credit.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont have a problem putting money into it.
<Stormy`> ah, I see
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I wont just stop paying the bill lol
<Sumica> 00,10so many quits
<Stormy`> I guess that changes things a bit
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but ill let you decide on stuff/
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if you want to make that decision.
<Stormy`> still, more people would be nice
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Like I said, if this was a pony room it would be much more active. :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hard to keep a dying francise active.
<Stormy`> we actually do have #bronies still up :P
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if netsplit or bored chat.
<Stormy`> Have you seen darkSpyro lately?
<Bronysith> this anime looks fun
<Stormy`> It's thriving
<Stormy`> full of kids and trolls, but still very alive
*Mega_Milk too busy watching stream
<Kandarihu> Those aren't netsplits
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I havent seen anything spyro
<Sumica> 00,10no they are not
<Blako> brb
<VenHur> Bronysith: I'm starting to grow into it...
<Stormy`> I don't even care about spyro much either, I just want the forum to stay alive
<Cades> I posted a thread there, but I guess they don't appreciate my attempts to bring the spyro community together more
<Sumica> 00,10but often chat goes realy quiet when the server you are on splits from the rest of the network
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> dont advertise spyroforum there lol
<Stormy`> So I've been trying to bring more activity into it
<Stormy`> Yeah, the two forums have this really competitive mindset about each other
<Stormy`> mention SF there and you're going to get burned
<Stormy`> Just like if you mention darkSpyro on SF
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the reason why darkspyro is active is because theres guides and stuff there.
<Kandarihu> If he feels more comfortable with the revolver, that's his weapon of choice.
<Stormy`> Yeah I guess that does draw people in
<Mega_Milk> Kandarihu: He's speaking with a lawyer. There gonna use EVERYTHING against you.
<Stormy`> I don't know why I even care anymore lol, I would just be sad to see Spyroforum die
<Bronysith> I hate prosecutors
<Kandarihu> Mega_Milk, I know.
<Invi> lol dat vote
<pot80> Hi, hello, howdy and what not
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi pot80
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> needs more young people.
<Mega_Milk> pot80: Sup.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> to stay up all night and post useless dribble.
<pot80> Mega_Milk not much
<Sumica> 00,10I realy need to see if I can get video out to work on my vita
<Stormy`> haha, you mean like us 6 years ago?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes exactly.
<Sumica> 00,10want to stream legend of dragoon
<Bronysith> Sumica: 0_0
<Stormy`> fun times
<Bronysith> Sumica: dont wipe once on the first disk
<Sumica> 00,10nice
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> my 3d printing forum is kind of getting popular
<ASoftFluffyThing> >mfw I forgot BanzaiCon was started today through Sunday
<Bronysith> Sumica: would you be able to do that?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Maybe next year.
<Kandarihu> Cool. PSO2 is coming out for Vita
<RedDragonX> Unless you founded a board purely based on Skylanders you wont get any Spyro activity lol
<Bronysith> i cant wait till PSO2 for PC
<Mega_Milk> Oooof course
<Bronysith> American release i can taste it
<Stormy`> well we wouldn't want that
<Mega_Milk> pulling the race car.
<VenHur> PSO2? I may never played the first or that one...but I love it from the aspect of the gameplay.
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I've been playing the Japanese version, and it's pretty sweet. Gameguard spoils the experience, though.
<Stormy`> I personally have nothing against Skylanders, but I don't have much interest in playing it either
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: ill just wait till english version cause i dont feel like translating moon speak
<RedDragonX> it's just focused on a different group
<Stormy`> Yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> Does he not have an electronic brain too?
<RedDragonX> the franchise focused down on a different generation
<Kandarihu> Frankly, I'm not sure what to make of this sub class system.
<Sumica> 00,10I would have to find a way to hack it so it can use the usb out as a video feed
<RedDragonX> which Idc that's business
<Stormy`> crazy how angry people are getting about it though really...
<Sumica> 00,10it works on the PSP but need to figure it out for vita
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont know anything about it.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ive seen it in walmart and thats it.
<Stormy`> they're all like "how dare they ruin Spyro I hate them forever"
<RedDragonX> LOL
<Bronysith> is the vita pretty good sumi?
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I use an English patch so that most of the important text is English.
<Stormy`> And I'm just like... how do you think I felt when TLoS came out?
<Sumica> 00,10I like it so far
<Stormy`> XD
<RedDragonX> well let's see they were ruining spyro anyways as it was so why beat a dead horse
<Sumica> 00,10but it's games list is realy limited
<Mega_Milk> Sumica: How does it play? Pretty smooth controls?
<RedDragonX> LoS could have worked had the developers actually given a shit
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the last spyro game I played was a new beginning.
<Bronysith> i just want a PSP for Final Fantasy Dissidia
<Stormy`> I still haven't played DotD
<Sumica> 00,10but seeing as some developer leaked a ISO app for it
<RedDragonX> unfortunately most developers these days don't care about overall content just meeting a deadline
<Sumica> 00,10so realy I can install just about any thing on it
<Mega_Milk> Bronysith: That is my favorite game on psp.
<Stormy`> I'm thinking about buying it and a screen recorder and posting it on youtube for lolz
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it's real smooth
<Sumica> 00,10great screen
<Mega_Milk> Bronysith: Oh! and chaos core.
<Bronysith> ...
<Bronysith> crisis core =_=
<Sumica> 00,10CC is a good game
<RedDragonX> I can't believe dS is stil l alive lol, must be chaotic as hell
<Mega_Milk> Bronysith: hahaha XD been a minute :3
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/WvcIF.png
<Stormy`> Probably, I don't pay attention to it anymore though
<Mega_Milk> yeah my usd stopped working a loooong time ago sadly.
<Stormy`> Just looking at the online list and seeing names like BlackholesWolf tells me all I need to know
<RedDragonX> lulz
<Sumica> 00,10the dual touch screens takes some get used to on the vita though
<Stormy`> It's all 9-12 year olds and trolls
<Sumica> 00,10had to turn the back one off for web use
<Silver_Spoon> OBJECTION
<Stormy`> trolls that pretend to be 9-12 year olds

<Kandarihu> Alright. Time to switch computers
<RedDragonX> oh no the world is coming to an end
<Stormy`> I know right
<pot80> I have no idea what just happened :P I should have started watching this earlier
<RedDragonX> it involves Eastwood is balances out
<Sumica> 00,10it's a stand alone story ep, not much happend pot80
<Kammerjunk> I can hear pling sounds and I don't know where they're coming from and it's scaring me.
<Invi> lol
<Stormy`> I got to go pretty soon, but one more thing
<Kandarihu> Yeah. The judges in the trial were all using Jameson bodies
<Stormy`> Spyrorocks[Laptop]: if we did decide to move the channel, would you be willing to change the widget at spyrochat.com to point to the new one?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> of course.
<Stormy`> Some people still use the site to get here
<Stormy`> Okay, cool

<Kandarihu> magmablock, it's a future in which cybernetic technology and advanced AI is blurring the line between human and machine.
<Chrysalis> yeah
<Chrysalis> supprisingly adding some deadzone REALLY helps with flight
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back......stupid hiking boots......
<Chrysalis> i shot someone down earler
<magmablock> Sounds interesting. I've always had an interest in that sort of thing
<Dark92Enigma> American Comic Books MENTIONED over Manga?
<doctor_whooves127> i was thinking more like china
<Dark_Horst> btw, are you guys in PL tomorrow?
<Kandarihu> I can totally imagine that being the subject of this episode's Tachikomatic Days
<pot80> could be
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> no worries
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I was just making a joke really
<Kimori> I see
<Kandarihu> BTW, is anyone else here looking forward to Indie Games for Good?

<Kjakings> 7I like the idea that you exile people.
<Lil_B> he everyone :)
<Stormy`> Now that I think about it I haven't talked in #epic-chat in forever
<MadSurge> Herro Lil_B :3
<pot80> Kandarihu maby but big games developers can come up with exelent games once in a while
<Sylandest> howdy Lil_B
<Lil_B> what are we watching?
<Stormy`> So it probably seems pretty creepy that I was just lurking and overheard all that
<pot80> hi Lil_B
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Ghost in the Shell
<Sumica> 00,10ghost in the shell
<Stormy`> hah
*Lil_B hugs MadSurge Sylandest and pot80 :)
<pot80> yay free hugs
<Kandarihu> pot80, I'm talking about the IGG marathon. It's coming up on October 19th
<Lil_B> I've heard the name, but never watched it, only the Movie Revie by the Sage
<Kimori> Spyro chat will live on :D
<Bronysith> Sumica: so is this like a mystery anime or something?
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, this has it's fair share of action.
<Cades> yay!
<Sumica> 00,10scifi/ thriller/action
*Sylandest hugs Lil_B back
<Kjakings> 7You keep believing that
<Ryunosuke> its over NINE THOUSAND!!!!!
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S OVER 90000
<Ryunosuke> oh
<Stormy`> aw, are you threatening them?
<Stormy`> cute
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> problem is aristeo is gone and I dont know if i still have oline
<Stormy`> what's oline?
<Kjakings> 7... I wasn't
<Bronysith> Sumica: its strange the similarities my book has with this anime... AND I NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE
<pot80> Kandarihu oh hope you don't mind if I ask what IGG marathon is (guessing something that everyone knows about but me XD)
<Kjakings> 7my point was that the chat has died before and it probably will again
<Stormy`> Well it did slightly come back to life
<Sumica> 00,10just wait, the big story starts becomeing more clear this ep
<Invi> i dont know it either
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy` network oper
<Kandarihu> pot80, Indie Games for Good. Are you familiar with Desert Bus for Hope?
<Stormy`> oh
<Ryunosuke> hive mind?
<pot80> Kandarihu umm... nope
<Kimori> Is Aristeo really the one that controls this place? not you Spyrorocks?
<Lil_B> Guy had a small face
<Stormy`> I still have NetworkStaff3
<Kjakings> 7hah bless them they still think SR is a god.
<Stormy`> Whatever that entails I'm not exaclty sure
<MadSurge> The crow was calling them names :D
<Stormy`> But you got oper about the same time as me so you probably still do to
<Stormy`> Kimori: Aristeo was basically network admin
<Stormy`> SR owned the servers
<Sumica> 00,10and then things start to show them selves
<Kimori> How would it be a problem if Aristeo cannot be contacted?
<MadSurge> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
<Stormy`> Hey RedDragonX, do you still have oper?
<Kandarihu> Okay. Well, the IGG Marathon is a bunch of guys on a video stream/chat showing off various indie games. It's a fundraiser for Child's Play (a program for stocking children's hospitals with games to help kids pass the time).
<Sumica> 00,10so all the crames they spoke of earlyer in the show these guys are the ones that did it
<Stormy`> If we need to to upper-privilaged oper-y things
<Sumica> 00,10crimes*
<pot80> ok thanks that makes more sense now :)
<Stormy`> like gline and such
<SuperDERP> hello
<magmablock> As you know
<MadSurge> Sumica: so why are they doing all this?
<Sumica> 00,10to insite a revolution
<Kandarihu> True fabian form. Heating up the world so that they can reshape the world to their own hearts' desire... those scoundrels.
<Stormy`> I think, but I'm not sure, that Aristeo also maintained the servers
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have root to the server so...
<Shizuka> 13ponies missed an opportunity for mica
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I can always modify stuff.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But once I login things might not work anymore.
<Shizuka> 13or sumi rather.. i keep forgetting your pings..
<MadSurge> Okay, at this point they're just comparing sizes :D
<Stormy`> What do you mean?
<Stormy`> like everything just goes down?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont really know what im doing.
<MadSurge> "I did the biggest crime!" " NO, I did the biggest crime!"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its a joke.
<Stormy`> oh
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> har har har.
<magmablock> I assassinated the president,then brought him back to life and assassinated him again!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> When I ran ubuntu on my laptop I accidentally formatted it one day. No joke.
<MadSurge> ^
<Stormy`> wait what?
<Stormy`> how?
<Sumica> 00,10oh yeah well I huged a pony
<magmablock> I also ate his dog
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I was trying to secure-erase a file
<Stormy`> D:
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but it accidentally the whole drive.
<Mega_Milk> Sumica: Horee sheet your hardcore....
<MadSurge> AGH, IDENTICAL WOMEN
<VenHur> His name was "Dog".
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and ubuntu isnt forgiving it lets you mess shit up.
<Sumica> 00,10robots
<Stormy`> that's exactly why I'm scared of terminal stuff
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I mean, it was a pretty dumbass move on my part
<Kandarihu> "I killed a famous rapper. Then I found the other rappers that his fans liked and killed them too"
<Sumica> 00,10they handle the simple operations such as flying planes and security
<MadSurge> Then why make them human? Just make them two arms and ahead
<Mega_Milk> Flying a plane is simple?
<Stormy`> Not that I'd have anything to lose if I wiped my laptop, but still
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but its pretty funny to be able to say you accidentally formatted your computer.
<Stormy`> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> funny, but not good to say at a job interview or anything
<Sumica> 00,10multy use MadSurge
<VenHur> I ated a taco, then finds another taco and I ated that taco too.
<Stormy`> yeah that doesn't exactly happen everyday
<Stormy`> ugh job interviews...
<Sumica> 00,10that way they dont have to buy a whole new platform for diffrent uses
<magmablock> Why doesn't his mouth ever move?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Imma be giving the interviews
<Stormy`> I'm hoping I can just work from home and never have to do one of those again
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> not going to them.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ill make sure i ask lots of awkward questions.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> that dont relate to the job.
<Sumica> 00,10it's explamned later magmablock
<pot80> how do you change your name? Do I have to log out and come back in?
<Stormy`> You're awful
<Stormy`> I would hate you :P
<Sumica> 00,10use /nick pot80
<magmablock> I'm going to hazard a guess that he has some kind of radio in his brain or something
<Kandarihu> pot80, /nick <whatever>
<VenHur> You can change your name with /nick...what, do I have to demonstrate?
<MadSurge> NICE JOB
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> OK so this nutter comes into my shop today
<Sumica> 00,10dat brain reboot
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> previously he had called like 10 times
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and wasted like 10 minutes for every call he made
<Kandarihu> with a fist
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> asking dumbass questions
<pot80> thanks
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and wanting to put different tires on his trailer and all this dumb shit
<pot80> wait...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> now he comes here today
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and he stands for 2 hours with a tape measure measuring every little detail of this little $900 trailer he wants to buy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> seriously, wasting my time
<MadSurge> THE HELL
<Mega_Milk> 0.0
<doctor_whooves127> he did it wrong you need to kick him in the head twice
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, indeed
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I should just tell him to go somewhere else
<pot80> oops
<Stormy`> Lambda has awesome stories about idiots that call his place
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I can sell like 10 $6k trailers in the time that he wastes my time
<Mega_Milk> major artery
<Mega_Milk> he's dead.
<MadSurge> WORST CRIMINALS EVER
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I like people who know what they want and are ready to buy, which is 90% of my customers
<Stormy`> This one vendor won't shut up about his iPhone
<VenHur> ...Well...that was anti-climaxtic.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Oh yeah my job has 0 to do with computers or tech.
<Sumica> 00,10it's only the start
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> LOL
<Stormy`> "I have the new product list, email me on my iPhone"
<Mega_Milk> Yeah no point in ending a story were everyone just kills themselves lol
<Kandarihu> And a spectacular start, too.
<MadSurge> Sumica: what start? They're DEAD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Send it in a non-iphone comaptible format
<Stormy`> "Call me on my iPhone about the order you want to place"
<Sumica> 00,10the guy in white did't die
<Stormy`> "----Sent from my iPhone"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I always remove that dumb signature
<Stormy`> LOL
<VenHur> Sumica: :O
<Mega_Milk> MadSurge: There are more followers of the organization as well I would guess.
<MadSurge> Sumica: I know, but he's ONE guy.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> alright I admit it I did buy an iphone
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but the last thing I do is talk about it
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, they totally screwed up the refugees before they did it first.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> people always ask oh is that the new dumbshit phone, im like "yeah it sucks though."
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and I start talking about what it cant do.
<Stormy`> He would probably call and be like "Umm, this doesn't work on my iPhone..."
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> then they shut up.
<MadSurge> YAAAAAY
<Kandarihu> Reset ZA WARUDO!
<Mega_Milk> uhhh......?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I did fire one customer though a few days ago
<MadSurge> YESH
<Mega_Milk> Trip to sugar ube corner :3
<Sylandest> XD
<Mega_Milk> cube*
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> he showed up and was all like, "oh those guys across the freeway have this trailer for $100 less and it has this and this and this"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> im like
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "why dont you buy it then?"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and I walked away
<VenHur> Lolwat?
<Sylandest> its so hard to watch this and not bust out laughing
<alexxm> is the stream over?
<MadSurge> Celestia, stop doing that to the stairs!
<Stormy`> haha
<Mega_Milk> alexxm: Nope
<Cades> good job
<Kandarihu> I should probably be ready to go into fast-mode every time Sumica finishes with an anime episode.
<Sylandest> awwwww
<Stormy`> I don't get those customers that try to match prices or whatever
<MadSurge> DERPY <3
<pot80> oh do I actually have to use the <insert nick> <>?
<Mega_Milk> The next time I am all alone at work in the foundry. Im gonna do that -lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well the thing is I know my prices are the lowest
<Stormy`> Why would you go into one store and complain that another store is selling it cheaper?
<DaringDerpy> woooooh
<VenHur> D'aaaaaaaaaawwwwwww...

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I actually got threats from my competitors.

<Cades> hahaah
<newnamegoeshere> am i doing this right?
<Mega_Milk> newnamegoeshere: Eeyup
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Then once they are broke, imma raise my prices.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and have a moinopoly.
<MadSurge> newnamegoeshere: yep!

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> i think.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> maybe ill sell a lot of enclosed trailers.
<ekips> sorry Sumica, I just couldn't resist
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> or maybe ill go broke. well see.
<taoumi> i'm sorry dery... but i wouldn't use your post
<Sumica> 00,10so all you did was make a longer name....
<taoumi> derpy*
<Stormy`> How did you ever get into selling trailers?
<Kandarihu> Or just register it and give it a silly vhost?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> My dad and I started the business a year ago
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and I just kind of went with it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I lied though, I use all my computery talents and stuff to make stuff more efficent
<Sumica> 00,10but I like my current Vhost
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> we are years and years a head of everyone else.
<pot80_hwanstuff> well I thought people did this when they were afk or summing?
<cantthinkofalongerni> there is a limit
<cantthinkofalongerni> ::p
<Sumica> 00,10well you can,
<Sumica> 00,10you dont have to though
<Bronysith> Sumica: for some reason, this song gives me nostalgia of Zone of the Enders, probably it was a giant mech game
<Kandarihu> I meant giving the "newnamegoeshere" nick. Registering it and giving it a self-depricating vhost.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://laserpointerforums.com/f57/punked-thread-77828.html#post1119546
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> jerry dont like ponies… die.
<Sumica> 00,10Vhost are tied to the log in though
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> He doesnt like me either though
<Sumica> 00,10so if I use the name it's gonna be my host
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because I almost made him go broke.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> when I was selling laser stuff.
<Kandarihu> Sumica, I see.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hahaha.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> dont read the thread it was made by a nutcase.
<Kandarihu> I see.
<Stormy`> I wasn't planning to :P
<MadSurge> Glass eyes sees the problem with their crime plans
<Stormy`> I remember you were talking to me on gmail one time and just kept saying shit about lasers
<Stormy`> And I was like "you know I have no idea what the hell you're talking about right?"
<Stormy`> And you just ignored me and kept rambling
<Stormy`> lol
<Kandarihu> That set up with tying Vhosts works in multiple ways.
<pot80_hw> so I'm going to do some h/w now bye
<Mega_Milk> pot80_hw: later.

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Have you been to a hot topic store?
<Stormy`> Pretty sure they have a license for it anyway
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> They dont have them in canada, but i went to one in the usa
<Kandarihu> taoumi, his human brain can still be addicted to nicotine

<MadSurge> himself: I plan to see a ton of things, but then I get lazy
<ekips> I think the english dub has been streamed here already
<Stormy`> I would so prefer rain to the winters we get though
<RedDragonX> west coast society is dominated by many things I don't want to be part of
<himself> Sumica: well im the only one that seems to want english, i just feel like an anime like this can be hard to follow with subs
<Pink3> Fluttashy Rap :L

<RedDragonX> if anywhere I suggest the Dakota's
<Bronysith> Sumica: you owe me one semesters worth of tuition
<MadSurge> himself: really silly anime about a guy going to the titular school where everyone's nuts and a box robot is always mistaken for a human :D
<Stormy`> But Lambda doesn't like the climate there
<RedDragonX> those are the only states that are somewhat close to having a balanced budge lol
<Stormy`> so we have to compromise somehow
<Michael> owned
<weegee2062> my evil senses are tingling
<RedDragonX> my dad wants me to move there
<MadSurge> Chess is boring :s

<Chrysalis> Vixenification
<Saturn> 08,01hey Chrysalis, if you've not actually ordered it, and you want BitterTea to make you one, i could probably call in a favour with her
<Amu-chan> Is it wrong of me to find it entertaining to watch a righty struggle with left handed tools? XD
<weeping_pegasi82> who?
<Chrysalis> Hmmm, itll probably be cheaper that way, current quote is £120

<Saturn> 08,01i vote pudding.
<AJIsAwesome> I've already seen enough of Code Geass to know what goes on.
*Saturn 08,01goes to find something sweet to nom on
<alexxm> hey Saturn you ever thought of introducin the chat to this guy http://derpy.me/1dn4-
<Caramel> 2,14 alexxm: that's borderline creepypasta, don't post it

<Saturn> 08,01<3
<DeathStar> hello Derpy_Hooves
<DeathStar> woops
<DeathStar> hello DerpyMajor
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DerpyMajor :)
<weeping_pegasi82> MORE machine based anime?
<AJIsAwesome> Yes.
<prince-dari> Amu-chan: Apparently every year ~2000 left-handed people die from using tools made for right-handed people.
<DeathStar> there will ALWAYS be more machine based anime
*weeping_pegasi82 sighs
<prince-dari> What a shit way to go out
*Major sips some tea
<Dark92Enigma> ECHO!
<Dark92Enigma> Woooooooo!
<Dark92Enigma> Ok, i'm back
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, Dark92Enigma. :)
<Dark92Enigma> So, tomorrow is the second delivery of NOSTALGIAWEEN!
<AJIsAwesome> Yay! :)
<Cranberry_Scotch> What movies are tomorrow and Saturday?
<AJIsAwesome> The King's SPeech and Ppg Movie.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Oh, right
<Dark92Enigma> i know, i took it from NC, but we're watching movies in OCTOBER
<Dark92Enigma> I'm ready to take on the PPG movie........but i'll bet for an honest review at the end of it, so i'll get all the inspiration tomorrow night
<AJIsAwesome> PAWNCH
*Dark92Enigma writes down: ''October PAWNCH''
<Cranberry_Scotch> Here's a paradox for you: Does the set of all sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?
<AJIsAwesome> *nearby turret explodes*
<Dark92Enigma> #MindBlown
<Kandarihu> Cranberry_Scotch, no
<Dark92Enigma> first hashtag in months
<doctor_whooves127> oh hey eureka seven
<doctor_whooves127> we should watch eureka 7 AO
<AJIsAwesome> Wow. THat sucks.
<Dark92Enigma> so until i get a decent video editor.....(not WMM) my reviews will be written
<Kandarihu> Oh man, I can't watch this now.
<TheMaster> Oh hey, its Eureka 7
<Dark92Enigma> Eureka 7?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Dark92Enigma> What's it about again?
<AJIsAwesome> Not sure.
<TheMaster> I was told that its a awesome series but I must have tuned in for the wrong episodes
<Asuna> Hey all
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Asuna. :)
<Caramel> 2,14 it's about a boy who learns to grow up
<Caramel> 2,14 it's as simple as that
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, that's what I keep hearing too.
<doctor_whooves127> the seven swell
<TheMaster> But is it as awesome as TTGL?
<AJIsAwesome> Join Gekkostate? What about joining Bronystate? :D
*Dark92Enigma ADVENTURE HO!!!!!!!!
<Caramel> 2,14 they are two different animes
<alexxm> whos a ho
<Asuna> What's up?
<Caramel> 2,14 with two completely different focuses
<Caramel> 2,14 to say one is better than the other is ignorant of what they try to do
<TheMaster> whose that voice actor? Sounds almost like Luffy
<sonicdude558> I am back with a rendering video
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: That's an NC reference, from the nicktoons episode
<alexxm> i know that
<AJIsAwesome> Dat snort
<TheMaster> giant surf boarding robots
<sonicdude558> yay more japanese animes
<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: Did they ever make an English dub of this?
<TheMaster> chicks dig giant robots, its just a fact
<Caramel> 2,14 yes
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<sonicdude558> Does it suck?
<AJIsAwesome> JUst wanted to know.
<Caramel> 2,14 my opinion on the matter would be bias
<Caramel> 2,14 since I dislike english dubs
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind English dubs, as long as they don't suck.
<TheMaster> best dubs are cowboy beebop and big O. And I say this knowing that they were on adult swim
<doctor_whooves127> i like the english dub better
<CrazyHippie> Hi everypony! What are we watching?
<TheMaster> Its really whichever you hear first
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CrazyHippie! :)
<CrazyHippie> Hi AJIsAwesome !
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 love interest
<TheMaster> Though Beebop did have some pretty awesome dubbing
<Dark_Horst> eureka seven ,it seems
<Bronysith> chat is lacking pie
<CrazyHippie> ok thx
*AJIsAwesome tosses a pie into chat
<Dark_Horst> at least that's what the blackscreen just read ^^
<TheMaster> Well he's not whiney like shinji or simon so as a giant robot protag he's got some things going for him
<Bronysith> TheMaster: HEY Simon is not whiny
<TheMaster> machine spirits? thats heresy. The emperor would not be pleased.
<TheMaster> At the start he is
<Bronysith> TheMaster: he becomes more badass than anything else though, cause unlike shinji, he grows a pair
<TheMaster> Yep. His transformation is actually pretty awesome as far as character development goes
<Bronysith> he becomes a god
<TheMaster> and yet he's still nobody ;-;. dat ending
*Bunny_Striker bonks everyone
<TheMaster> if gainax knows how to do one thing its make endings you remember
*AJIsAwesome is wearing a mettaur helmet
<Bronysith> TheMaster: that NGE ending was crap
<Bunny_Striker> darn
<TheMaster> which one? tv show ending or the movie?
<TheMaster> or the movie movies?
<Bronysith> tv show
<TheMaster> they ran out of money
<TheMaster> but you remember it
<Bronysith> and they were scraping the bottom of a barrel
<Bunny_Striker> MISILES!!!
<TheMaster> the redo of NGE is amazing though
<TheMaster> 2.0's ending. Oh mahn
<AJIsAwesome> 6
<AJIsAwesome> *^
<TheMaster> shinji went full kamina/simon
<Bunny_Striker> TRANSFORMERS! THAT ROBOT ISN`T IN DISGUISE!
<AJIsAwesome> You're talking about the rebirth series, right?
<Amu-chan> I doubt that statistic was compiled from any form of research. At least I can't see anything that says there was any research, just people spouting it as fact and not citing any sources.
<TheMaster> yes. The remake movies
<TheMaster> Rebuild
<AJIsAwesome> okay.
<Kandarihu> Rebuild
<AJIsAwesome> Whoops.
<AJIsAwesome> Dangit, I always get that wrong. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Can't wait for the last movie, though.
<TheMaster> I can't wait for the 3rd one
<Bunny_Striker> THE AMITA DRIVE!! DUN DUN DUUUUN!!!!
<Bronysith> NGE is pretty overrated though
<TheMaster> though its hard to imagine how they'll top 2.0
<TheMaster> Well i'm a sucker for unique takes on ideas
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: True.
<TheMaster> and NGE changed how giant robot animes worked
<Bunny_Striker> FAIL
<AJIsAwesome> That climax :D
<Bunny_Striker> Dat Fail
<Bunny_Striker> PWNIES!!!!!!!!!!
<TheMaster> Hey Caramel do you like One Piece at all?
<Kandarihu> One Piece
<Kandarihu> !
*Bunny_Striker dances with music
<Caramel> 2,14 it's alright...
<Bronysith> really fucking long series
<TheMaster> I was going to suggest you stream Strong World. The 'movie'
<TheMaster> well, the movie actually made by Oda
<sonicdude558> screw the 4kids version of it
<Bronysith> sonicdude558: THAT NEVER HAPPENED
<Kandarihu> One Piece is my favorite series of all.
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: it is really fucking long
<Amu-chan> Handedness isn't really kept track of in death records or any such thing, so such data couldn't be necessarily proven.
<TheMaster> Its worth it though
<AJIsAwesome> Long, but still going strong.
<sub06905> poison suction cups :3
<TheMaster> relatively slow start, but once it gets going
<AJIsAwesome> Loving every bit of it.
<TheMaster> right around the Arlong arc, then after that its just golden
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, as much as we'd all like to forget the 4Kids dub ever happen, the unfortunate reality of it is the reason why it doesn't have a chance on American TV.
<Bunny_Striker> Jigsaw vs Pinkie
<TheMaster> Its not really the same sort of shonen that naruto and bleach is, I doubt it'd have gotten very popular in the U.S.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: i am more impressed by the 26 episodes of Gurren lagann more than every other episode of one piece
<Ponies47> Hello everypony! :)
<RaveBrony> Thought I was missing BMN....then i realized its Thursday :D
<TheMaster> well the episodes stretch things out, reading the comics is more fun
<Amu-chan> If someone dies, I doubt the first question that comes to mind is "was your loved one a lefty?"
<RaveBrony> Hiya Ponies47!
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Well, that fine by me. That's your opinion, and I respect it. :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<Cranberry_Scotch> Everything I say is a lie
<sonicdude558> Hi bro Ponies47
<TheMaster> though some pretty awesome one piece episodes are out there. The whole water 7 arc is in my top favorite parts of the series
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponies47! :)
<TheMaster> Sogeking is probably the greatest super hero to ever live
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: dont get me wrong, its a good series, just incredibly drawn out
<TheMaster> and we'll never know who he is
<Cranberry_Scotch> I just told you guys a paradox
<alexxm> how are things Ponies47
<puffmuffins> hi
<Moopy> See heres something else though when people talking on skype sometimes there messing around with something in the background
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: That's okay.
<Ponies47> Ok alexxm. You?
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, the difference between... well, Bleachato... and One Piece is that One Piece is being planned out with an end in mind. The other series were being made without that.
<alexxm> i'm good Ponies47
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: dat feel when luffy is seperated from his crew
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Yep.
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, we should be careful not to spoil.
<aji> * | CCCP hugs aji
<TheMaster> Shh, no spoils. but yes, that was pretty intense
<AJIsAwesome> Favorite ark has to be CP9 so far.
<TheMaster> the whole whitebeard war arc
<Bronysith> the 4kids dub never happened
<Bronysith> NEVER
*aji hugs CCCP back <3
<SuperDERP> whats this?
<sonicdude558> Yes it did
<sonicdude558> IT DID
<TheMaster> Whitebeard is the one character that I think is immune to rule 63
<sonicdude558> don't deny it :)
<AJIsAwesome> TheMaster: :D
<TheMaster> Because, just try and imagine a female whitebeard
<TheMaster> you can't
<Kandarihu> The timeslot in which the 4Kids dub held might as well be the void timeslot.
<DeathStar> Bronysith: what is the 4kids? I don't beleave that exists at all >_>
<TheMaster> Whitebeard's body repels estrogen
<Kandarihu> Er, the Void Slot
<Amu-chan> I do know that right handed tools can be dangerous for a lefty, particularly power tools, but I doubt there's any real data to support the claim that 2000+ lefties die from right handed tools a year.
<Bronysith> DeathStar: you got it right
<SuperDERP> TheMaster derpy hooves is immune.
<SuperDERP> but thats ponies
<TheMaster> A male derpy? Hm, I haven't seen that
<sonicdude558> DeathStar, they made 8 episodes and they got the license taken away
<TheMaster> Also Whitebeard has best power ever
<SuperDERP> ive searched and not find
<Amu-chan> I'm both clumsy, and a lefty, and have used right handed tools before. I haven't died yet.
<TheMaster> earthquake powers taken to hax extremes
<Bronysith> TheMaster: i like blackbeards power better
<DeathStar> sonicdude558: no they didn't as they do not exist! ><
<Kandarihu> So any knowledge of what went on during that timeslot is strictly forbidden. Genocide of innocent people is preferable to public knowledge of that travesty.
<sonicdude558> One Piece?
<AJIsAwesome> It REALLY sucks that the One Piece games did terrible in the US. I loved Unlimited Adventure.
<Bronysith> TheMaster: cause then he just friggin takes white beards
<TheMaster> shhh
<TheMaster> not eveyrone has religiously watched one piece
<Bunny_Striker> DAFUQ???!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Luffy knows Haki, right?
<TheMaster> and I thought that was sort of weird
<Kandarihu> Alright. I'm getting out of this convo. I can't keep talking about it without spoiling
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: ja
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Has he mastered it yet?
<TheMaster> We'll have to see when he fights someone serious
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: idk
<TheMaster> someone like akainu, who deserves several fists to the face
<Kandarihu> I'm just following the anime and he ... DANGIT!
<Major> Thank god I can say Aloha Friday tomorrow
<TheMaster> read the comics
<AJIsAwesome> I hate Akainu.
<TheMaster> He's a pretty neat villian though
<AJIsAwesome> He is.
<TheMaster> a non lazy admiral for ocne
<TheMaster> once*
<sonicdude558> rawr
<Dark_Horst> is the robot an AI?
<TheMaster> I can't decide whose the most hax though. probably Kizaru
<Bronysith> my god, this is Luffys VA isnt it Caramel ?
<TheMaster> I thought so myself
<PeachStreak> howdy everypony how are y'all
<TheMaster> I can sort of hear it
<sonicdude558> ding ding
<sonicdude558> dinners done
<sonicdude558> :)
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah Luffy's Japanese voice can get a little.........overexcited. :D
<TheMaster> But its infectious. Luffy is best shonen protagonist
<Bunny_Striker> odd place to hug
<AJIsAwesome> Wipe your nose. :D
<sonicdude558> AMITA DRIVVVVVVVVVVVU
<Bronysith> suddenly shiny sparkle sparkles
<sonicdude558> did somepony say Twilight Sparkle?
<TheMaster> Luffy alone has tons of hilarious moments, usually shonen protags are serious and play the straightman
<sonicdude558> Where is she?
<Bunny_Striker> EUREKA!!!!!!!1
<sonicdude558> >_>
<sonicdude558> <_<
<TheMaster> way to kill your robot Renton
<Petrified_Discord> Don't worry. Missiles have never killed anything in anime.
<Bunny_Striker> Petrified_Discord: are you sure
<sonicdude558> oh u Sweetie Belle
<Moopy> brb my dinner is ready
<sonicdude558> And the chat quiets down...
<sonicdude558> :D
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Bunny_Striker> ROSE CRATOR
<sonicdude558> FISH
<Bunny_Striker> SKY
<sonicdude558> FISH
<AJIsAwesome> So what did he do?
<TheMaster> I also would support a stream of wakfu
<Bronysith> wakfu?
<Bronysith> oh you mean dofus 2.0
<Bunny_Striker> odd quiet agsin
<Bunny_Striker> again
<Bronysith> damn it ponies
<TheMaster> Yes, the tv show is great
<pinkiepie> :'(
<AJIsAwesome> What is it, Bronysith?
<pony47625> no ponies
<Bronysith> too much r34 art of ponies
<Bronysith> AND I LIKE IT
<Bunny_Striker> must resist...MEOW!!!!!!!1
<Caramel> 2,14 not in this chat Bronysith
<Bronysith> ok
<Petrified_Discord> These aren't the pics you're looking for...
<Petrified_Discord> Move along now.
<Iliketurtles> I like turtles :3
<Gaston> lowl
<Bronysith> pony artists have some of the best pics ever, wrek knows how to draw really well
<AJIsAwesome> No one "lowl"s like Gaston!
<Bronysith> i shall bury you alive aji
<aji> D:
<Gaston> indeed
<Petrified_Discord> Not even Gaston does anything like Gaston.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: that was for you
<Kandarihu> Hmm, someone thought they heard Luffy's Seiyuu. That would be Mayumi Tanaka, who Wikipedia isn't recording as having a role in Eureka 7
<Bunny_Striker> CREATURE CATS MEOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Gaston> No one gets bored and leaves the chat like Gaston
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: :P
<Major> So~.......
<AJIsAwesome> La~.......
<TheMaster> Te~
<AJIsAwesome> Do~
<DerpyMajor> Ta~......
<Petrified_Discord> Te? Ta?
<AJIsAwesome> .......
<TheMaster> No no no, Doe a deer, a female deer
<TheMaster> Ray a drop of golden sun?
<Petrified_Discord> Mi, a name I call myself
<AJIsAwesome> I don't know this one. :D
*Petrified_Discord facepalm XD
<TheMaster> Those guys look like they belong in a gundam show
<Petrified_Discord> I think we're good with just 3 notes
<AJIsAwesome> 18 years old and I never knew this one by heart. :D
<DeathStar> Petrified_Discord: fa a long long way to run~
<dynamo2814> petrified discord its facehoof
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: What if he's not a pony?
<Petrified_Discord> dynamo2814: facetalon
<dynamo2814> hmmm true
<Major> Fa la la la....la la la~......
<TheMaster> Renton, believe in me who believes in the surfboard
<Petrified_Discord> So, a needle pulling thread
<TheMaster> we're done with that gag now, no more nazi musicals
<TheMaster> Unless its the producers
<DeathStar> la a not to follow so~
<alexxm> why can't we have nazi musicals
<AJIsAwesome> AH
<AJIsAwesome> Now I see how that crater was made.
<DeathStar> it's NOT a nazi musical it's a musical containing nazis
<Petrified_Discord> Ti, a drink with jam and bread
<TheMaster> Renton! Your surfobard will be the one to pierce the heavens!
<TheMaster> surfboard*
<DeathStar> and that would bring us back to do!
<Cades> Just wait amu...
<Cades> It will happen
<Petrified_Discord> do do do...
<dynamo2814> it looks like rainbowdash set off a nuke
<TheMaster> i-is that? an A-T field? wait...still wrong anime
<Amu-chan> I'll just stay away from right handed power tools. XP
<AJIsAwesome> Guessing they're the enemies?
*Major cant wait for xmas
<TheMaster> Unit 1 has gone berserk
*sonicdude558 wants to get a WiiU
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: A military in an anime? Nooooooooooooo
*sonicdude558 thinks he will use a WiiU more than a Wii
<Bronysith> The video game industry is going to crash unfortunetely
<AJIsAwesome> Too bad the Wii U won't play Gamecube games.
<sonicdude558> no matter
<sonicdude558> I got a black gamecube from a garage sale :)
<Major> LUCKY! D:
<Bronysith> um
<Bronysith> black gamecubes are really common
<Major> Not in NC
<Petrified_Discord> The gamecube is rediculously resiliant. I dropped mine down a flight of concrete stairs and it still works fine
<sonicdude558> A long time ago when the gamecube was first released
<sonicdude558> I got a Indigo Gamecube for Christmas :)
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: Same thing with the original Nintendo DS.
<Major> fact there NOTHING here
<PeachStreak> http://www.foddy.net/CLOP.html
<Caramel> 2,14 petrified_discord: that's because there's not much in it
<Caramel> 2,14 trololololo
<sonicdude558> And then I sold it in a garage sale :(
<Petrified_Discord> Caramel: o u :P
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Your URL is.......interesting. :S
<Kandarihu> My Gamecube is damaged. Whenever Controller 4 is sent a Rumble signal, it is suddenly dead.
<Bronysith> i have a silver gamecube
<Petrified_Discord> I still think it's funny that there's been like 50 iterations of the DS and I've still got my Lite from the day it came out
<AJIsAwesome> Purple here. :P
<TheMaster> My favorite pmv got taken off youtube
<TheMaster> which made me sad
<Kandarihu> The malfunction really makes the MGStTS battles against Psycho Mantis a lot more frantic.
<Bronysith> oh hey its Caramel s fav vid
<Petrified_Discord> Bronysith: Silver gc ftw
<Caramel> 2,14 Derpy_hooves*
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: a deceiving URL but pretty fun and challenging game
<Caramel> 2,14 this is hardly my favorite video
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Ok.
<Kandarihu> I gotta beat him before he starts reading my input on the 3rd controller, or he becomes VERY frustrating to beat.

<Austin> Ponies47: did you jsut get on?
<AJIsAwesome> Let's not get on the whole "commercial" debate.
<AJIsAwesome> Last time it got a little out of hand.

<Kandarihu> I'm looking forward to Paul Ryan putting Joe Biden in his place
<Ponies47> Shizuka: He did? :O
<Shizuka> 13yes in fact, transformers was THAT bad
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dayum.
<AJIsAwesome> WOw.
<TheMaster> Biden is actually extremely smart, experienced and just says whatever he feels like which leads to his gaffes
<Ponies47> Is it bad I LIKE the song Linkin Park did for Transformers? :$
<Quick_Thinker> huh i've seen this piece of poo was it really so bad that i forgot the opening
<ASoftFluffyThing> This is the second one?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I saw it in theaters
<Austin> I've never seen this, is it as bad as eveyone says it is?
<Quick_Thinker> ^ who cares if its the 1 2 3 4 they all suck
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Is it bad that I liked the idea of a brony commercial despite the fact that we don't really need one?
<Shizuka> 13to note again, rifftrax has done the third bayformers but i don't have it
<Kandarihu> I hear he is good at debating. So I'm somewhat worried.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I didn't say I liked the idea. I said it was meh
<Moopy> its sweet tooth
<The_Awesomeness> in the year 3490 robots rule the earth
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I know. Just stating that I liked the idea.
<J_E_Smith71> So awesome the Transformers 2 riff
<Quick_Thinker> man i have to be honest the Hot Wheels movies i thought would suck but they are acutally pretty damn awesome (even has 2 MLP VA's)
<Rustymeat> hay guys
<Ponies47> Gah had to refresh
<The_Awesomeness> countries pffft bs im not part of a country im a citizen of Earth
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Rustymeat. :)
<Ponies47> Who pinged before?
<AJIsAwesome> I did.
<Rustymeat> ive never seen this movie
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Ryan is a jackass. Anyone who idolizes Ayn Rand is a jackass.
<J_E_Smith71> One of the few good things about the movie: Peter Cullen
<Quick_Thinker> and compared to this they are the godfather of movies for cars
<doctor_whooves127> yay rifftrax transformers
<The_Awesomeness> Im a citizen of earth not a nation
<AJIsAwesome> "Crisco" :D
<TheMaster> Shh, don't mention Ayn Rand. Paul says that he's rejected her now, even if he made most of his staffers read atlas shrugged
<TheMaster> Which is kind of cruel
<somepony_else> hi everypony
<Ponies47> Ping? I heard a ping before? Who pinged me before?
<DocSane> The_Awesomeness: Good luck with that when you have to file your taxes or travel to another country.
<TheMaster> Because its such a stupid book
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I did.
<The_Awesomeness> NOOOOOO h tapped over his birthday party
<pufmuffins> bye
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: You said? (Mah chat derped agian)
<AJIsAwesome> What were the ratings for this movie?
<TheMaster> How did i forget this movie so much
<ASoftFluffyThing> 5 minutes into movie, Michael Bay.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Yep :3
<Kandarihu> DocSane, they were saying that about Mitt Romney too.
<TheMaster> this movie literally absorbs your brain, I don't remember any of this
<somepony_else> transformers rifftrax? sweet :)
<DocSane> TheMaster: Every year at Passover, when we get to the reading of the 10 plagues, my uncle asks us to name any modern plagues. I usually go with the complete works of Ayn Rand.
<Shizuka> 13TheMaster: i've seen the riff for this probably six times.... hell i watched it the other day... i don't remember any of it either >>
<Quick_Thinker> AJIsAwesome the rating is watching this causes a full frontal lobotamy
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: 5.9 on IMDB
<Quick_Thinker> 5.9 WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Shizuka> 13that high o.o
<Ponies47> I haven't seen one of these movies in a long time
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Spouting bullshit forcefully doesn't make one a good president. It just means he can lie convincingly.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I said "I know. Just saying that I liked the idea. Just that there was a lot of disagreement and hate on the idea of one."
<Rustymeat> wtf
<J_E_Smith71> 21% on RT
<TheMaster> twin jar jars, hah
<Quick_Thinker> CAUSE ONE JAR JAR WASNT BAD ENOUGH
<RDash5000> TRANSFORMERS WITH COMMENTARY?! ME GUSTA!!! also hi
<somepony_else> hi RDash5000
<Kandarihu> DocSane, he wasn't spouting baloney forcefully. He was speaking about reality.
<Shizuka> 13almost makes this bearable
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I didn't say I hate it either. You'll just see what you think when the time comes
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RDash5000! :)
<Shizuka> 13i still can't stand twilight though
<Quick_Thinker> didnt like the room get a 2% on RT
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Okay. :)
<Shizuka> 13i love how utterly pointless this entire scene is
<Quick_Thinker> yet i like the Room Birdemic and any other bad indie movies more then this
<DocSane> Kandarihu: No, he really wasn't. And I had to live with that fool as a governor. He lies as naturally as breathing.
<RDash5000> im glad i joined :P
<Cypresswolf> in that segment, Buddha is setting up the bomb
<AJIsAwesome> What was the point of the parachute? :S
<Shizuka> 13truck falls out of plane and turns into robot.... then immediately turns back into a truck on the ground... and then five seconds later is robot again
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: :D
<Dark_Horst> dont get the problem. liked the movies. at least the first one. probably becasue transformers was never big in germany and i completely missed it
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: I was going to ask "The pony or the movie" but that has to be one of the most cliche jokes to make in this chat
<oGriofa> Hey.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, oGriofa. :)
<Shizuka> 13Dark_Horst: pretty much what mike just said here

*Ponies47 Prepares the wish list
<Dark_Horst> oh boy. vanu are busy getting their asses whooped on esamir
<RDash5000> baby booties!!!
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Is Peter Cullen's VAing terrible to you too?(Or maybe I'm just thinking he's good out of nostaliga of the old 80s cartoon)
<Shizuka> 13again? :3
<AJIsAwesome> Since this movie had terrible ratings, how did the third one receive?
<The_Awesomeness> my mom never gets that emotional
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Rustymeat> UGH
<Shizuka> 13J_E_Smith71: it's about what i'd expect from prime, though my canonical optimus is the beast wars optimus so :3

<J_E_Smith71> No chat reaction to the humping dogs? I'm suprised
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: IKR? :D
<RDash5000> Quick_Thinker: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Rustymeat> THis is not gratoutus at all

<Quick_Thinker> Smith71 its so bad we are being more MATURE THEN THIS MOVIE that point in life where a movie makes you mature
<DocSane> This movies feel so sleezy to watch.
<p4ngya> so far it seems like they're trying to make this movie as awkward as possible for families
<Shizuka> 13i... wow...
<Quick_Thinker> you know your movie sank an all time low to the bottom of the artic ocean right next to the titanic
<Shizuka> 13i just realized this is the first time i've actually paid attention to the dialogue here
<Ponies47> Shizuka: It's not that hard. Once you get use to holding it :P
<AJIsAwesome> I CAN SEE EVERYTHING!
<RDash5000> Shizuka: lol
<RDash5000> ATTACK OF THE APPLIANCES

<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Well the third one did *slightly* better, 6.9 on IMDB and 36% on RT
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Okay.
<DocSane> I truly despise this movie's theory that any damn machine can become a transformer.

<somepony_else> this doesn't make any sense...
<RDash5000> at least the third one is better.
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, why didn't he get here earlier? :S
<Quick_Thinker> is it sad when the rip off of your series (transmorphers) IS BETTER THEN THIS

<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I know, right? :S
<Shizuka> 13if i remember right, lebeef admitted he haaaaated this movie, and i think the main reason it sucked so much was it was written during the writers strike
<Quick_Thinker> so even the actors hate it
<AJIsAwesome> Wow.
<RDash5000> wow
<Quick_Thinker> man this movie is that fuckin bad
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Oh God the writers striike
<Cypresswolf> I'll bet that multi-million dollar paycheck was worth it none the less
<Ponies47> I remeber that
<somepony_else> so.... did they hire monkeys to write the script?
<DeathStar> not the vacume :(
<RDash5000> REJECTION
<Quick_Thinker> i mean im being honest i do like lebeef in certan movies but this ruined his acting carrer for life
<AJIsAwesome> Pointless clothes change is pointless? :S
<Cypresswolf> how much did Labuff make for this movie?

<RDash5000> transformers 2. aka a softcore porno with robots

<Slen> I watched them to laugh with mah friends

<scout19_tf2> 2nd and 3rd ones were pretty good
<Dark92Enigma> RDash5000: i would but my headphones crashed
<Caramel> 2,14 if I guessed that right, then Michael Bay is more predictable than I used to joke about

<cachi01> VenHur: hint for B movie i picked. we all hate it :3
<Dark_Horst> i mean, for fucks sae, their unit was especially founded to kill giant robots
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: ...I meant a GOOD horror classic, and that's it NOT 3D.
<Dark_Horst> you'd think the'd have armament that actually dos something
<RDash5000> NOT YOU
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: I know. :D
<Shizuka> 13aaaand...

<StinkomanFan> Frigging enter key
<Obsidian> yes
<Dark92Enigma-> back on!!!!!!!! FINISHED MY SURVEY! :)
<VenHur> Oh god...here's comes "THAT" scene!
<RDash5000> oh dear...
<fluttercry> 05,15...............................
<J_E_Smith71> Balls of brass sir, polished to the Nth degree
<Dark_Horst> RDash5000: that's like firing an m16 at a tank and hoping to hit a weakspo
<StinkomanFan> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND no
<StinkomanFan> Nevermind
<VenHur> .........................
<Rosfox> ...........................................
*Dark92Enigma- INSERT NOSTALGIA CRITIC reference
<VenHur> ........WHAT.
<Shizuka> 13well he was easily killed
<Spyrorocks[Air]> id say it was pretty close
<VenHur> THE.
<VenHur> FUCK.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> but i would give it to ryan
<RDash5000> PEW
<Dark92Enigma-> THE HELL?
<cachi01> and that was easy
<Dark92Enigma-> WEAK
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> B1 time
<Caramel> 2,14 well duh Shizu, he couldn't even kill the racist brothers
<Dark92Enigma-> that was WEAK
<Dark_Horst> which begs the question why they didnt fire that thing earlier
<emangamer> Shizuka, THANK YOU for telling me the name of trackmania
<RDash5000> NOW SHOOT THE MACHINE
<Spyrorocks[Air]> he presented himself much better than biden, and you'll agree when you watch it
<Obsidian> So....reload>
<J_E_Smith71> Someone just get Conker to destroy him, he can kill him by smashing his robo-balls with cinder blocks
<VenHur> Insert Duke Nukem refference.
<Caramel> 2,14 Oh no! A Big Bollocked, British Brass Boiler
<fluttercry> 05,15all the robots look the same
<Quick_Thinker> done voted for Hot Wheels movies
<fluttercry> 05,15KA BOOM
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: I've come to kick ass and chew gum.....AND I'M OUTTA GUM
<Stormy> my dad loves Paul Ryan apparently
<fluttercry> 05,15BAAAAAAAAM
<StinkomanFan> Did the Rascist bots die yet?
<Cypresswolf> Who's running this army? They knew tactical nukes were inbound, why run out of range at the last possible second?
<fluttercry> 05,15POOOOOOOW
<Stormy> I don't really know anything about him
<J_E_Smith71> StinkomanFan: Sadly no
<RedDragonX> It was a pretty even debate
<StinkomanFan> POW
<StinkomanFan> HAHA
<VenHur> No, the other refference from that giant robot's you know whats.
<RedDragonX> Biden tried to be more aggressive but I think he came out way too smug
<RDash5000> YOU ARE DEAD
<Dark92Enigma-> AFTER EFFECTS AFTER EFFECTS AFTER EFFECTS
<ASoftFluffyThing> FIREEEEEE AND EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE
<RDash5000> NOT BIG SUPRISE
<RedDragonX> as they put it
<RedDragonX> it looked like a cranky old man against a polite young man
<Spyrorocks[Air]> i agree, he seemed very smug
<ASoftFluffyThing> And Michael Bay messes himself so bad it goes everywhere
<Dark_Horst> i like how in the first movie two a-10s and a spectre couldnt kill scorponok and yet a bunch of bombs kill a whole troop of em
<Stormy> better than Obama looking down the whole time probably...
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> pump the blood out of his body
<RedDragonX> I don't think it will help them that much
<StinkomanFan> We need to get the Mercs from TF2 to fight these giant robots
<RedDragonX> it will depend on the other two president debates
<RDash5000> Dark_Horst: fuck logic
<cachi01> this beyatches aint got shit against a level 2 Hyperion loader robot
<fluttercry> 05,15It's not a Michael Bay movie without slow mo CHOPPAS
<StinkomanFan> They're better at it than the army and the navy combined!
*Dark92Enigma- But then the kid dies! NOOOOOOOO--wait, i guess it's not too bad
<Dark92Enigma-> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
<Dj_Cyber-4G> (1 kill away from pristege in MW3) Radio-"M.O.A.B inbound" Me-"MOTHER FU**ERS GOD DAMNIT!!!"
<RDash5000> cachi01: lol

<thelonepony> hi Malmortius :)
<RDash5000> zing!
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> Prime's kills in the third movie are pretty gruesome
<CriticKitten> That's how it works. In act 3, Optimus ends things in about 10 seconds. Also, surely you won't need those extra weapons and power later on.....OH WAIT
<cachi01> hi Malmortius :)
<Obsidian> and so Jetfire's sacrifice was easily forgotten
<Malmortius> So, when are we watching MLP :)
<Dark92Enigma-> And that Super-transformer died after 10 minutes......making this scene: ENTIRELY POINTLESS
<cachi01> Malmortius: tomorrow
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah just throw away your awesome armor upgrade Optimus

<CriticKitten> The robot singing over these songs? He sounds pretty close to LP'
<CriticKitten> Live, anyways.
<fluttercry> 05,15Look it up. 21 Guns ripped off Telephone Line so hard
<CriticKitten> They're that bad.
<AlienWarhead> Disembaudio needs to sing in every Rifftrax Credits
<Caramel> 2,14 Michael Bay's Art School Senior project was a fastcam image of a nuclear mushroom cloud. He received an A for his excellence in cinematography
<Dj_Cyber-4G> YAY SONGS IM NEVER GONNA HEAR!
<Dark92Enigma-> VenHur: NO! PLEASE NO! He has milked a great franchise FAR ENOUGH
<Dj_Cyber-4G> EEVVVEERRR
<CriticKitten> It really surprised me when I first heard them live, how bad it sounded.
<RDash5000> CriticKitten: i like 'em. personal opinion i guess.
<CriticKitten> RDash5000: I like the band. They sound terrible live, is all.
<Kandarihu> Caramel, really?
<J_E_Smith71> The Transformers ride is pretty much the Spider-Man ride, if you've been on that
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> they are rebooting the Transformers movies by the way
<Caramel> 2,14 rofl hell if I know. I was making a funny
*Dj_Cyber-4G 's ears explode

<Slen> Transformers was an amazing series, but then the Fire Nation attacked.
<AlienWarhead> So I guess this is how Scootabot sounds
<RDash5000> CriticKitten: never seen them live
<Kandarihu> Caramel, that would make a lot of sense if it was true
<cachi01> DeadpoolDash|GW2: how dafuq can you reboot something that is 5 years old?

<Dark92Enigma-> Spiderman, Spiderman, Your friendly neigborhood Spiderman
<CrimsonPhoenix> Caramel, you mean that drunk flim flam song?
<AJIsAwesome> I think his name is "Baconhair"?
<Slen> Yaplap is amazing.
<Caramel> 2,14 no, I'm talking about the guy who makes the songs like "At the F***** Gala"
<emangamer> Caramel: yeah, yaplap
<CrimsonPhoenix> ooooh
<fluttercry> 05,15I wish I could get popular on youtube by screaming into a mic
<CriticKitten> cachi01: Somewhat. It's somewhat better mostly because it beat the original trilogy, which is honestly worse than it seemed at the time.
<Slen> Caramel: but Yaplap is awesome D:
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the writing in the Transformers Prime series has way better writing then the movies
<StinkomanFan> Yeah that's Yaplap
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, thnb that's Yaplap.
<AJIsAwesome> *then
<fluttercry> 05,15How is Yaplap awesome when all he does is scream songs?
<Dark92Enigma-> Caramel: Oh the one who PUTS F-BOMBS in all of the song?
<Dark92Enigma-> YAP

<Dark92Enigma-> SONGS*
<emangamer> fluttercry: because it was pretty damn funny
<VenHur> fluttercry: Because...screaming shit is awesome.
<fluttercry> 05,15I fail to see the humor in that
<emangamer> the first time that is
<CriticKitten> I know, right? *I* can scream songs. It'd sound about the same. *shrug*
<StinkomanFan> ALL THE MILITARY
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just funny for some
<AlienWarhead> fluttercry I thought he was funny in Brony Reacts, but I never watched his videos
<Caramel> 2,14 it's funny, fluttercry, in the same way that the Autobots Fart jokes in this movie was
<CrimsonPhoenix> personally I couldn't care less about those versions
<Slen> fluttercry: I sung one of his songs at the talent show at my school :D
<StinkomanFan> Hans Zimmer? Who's that?
<AJIsAwesome> Yaplap is funny for some, not for others,
