<WallDives> Pokemon.
<Everlasting_Joy> :).
<Mega_Milk> I cant remember the last time I've played that game -lol
<Mega_Milk> Well

<Everlasting_Joy> Last one I played was Crystal.
<Mega_Milk> but still waiting on an update.
<Everlasting_Joy> Colt Big Mac :).

<WallDives> oh. then I wont waste time on it then./
<Dken2021> I ordered my copy on amazon literally the day before it was released
<Gold_Demona|DDR> lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Actually, I take that back, the last Pokemon game I played was "Pokemon Colloseum". That was fun.
<WallDives> Colloseum was pretty good.
<WallDives> I liek stadium better though.
<Dken2021> XD was also good too
<WallDives> ehh...
<Everlasting_Joy> I liked Stadium for it's Dodrio game boy :D.

<Mega_Milk> WallDives: But after the next update I think they said it will be at 1%
<ofna01> I've been listening to Heartaches by the Number since then
<WallDives> Mega_Milk, I dont like playing incomplete games. and since there more-than-likely isnt a metagame to it, I'll only play for storyline. and since the game isnt complete...
<Mega_Milk> ofna01: Also sorry to hear that.
<Mega_Milk> WallDives: Its not like its something totally new -lol
<Mega_Milk> WallDives: Its just pokemon with skins and a few text mods
<WallDives> I know. but I'd rather focus on something with a actual metagame.
<Mega_Milk> WallDives: meh

<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sumica.
<Wirisme> Hi sumica
<ofna01> morning sumi
<ofna01> you missed adorable wuna pic
<ofna01> http://liokin.deviantart.com/#/d5ce1jf
<Wirisme> that IS adorable
<ofna01> poor woona
<Everlasting_Joy> Storming a base, like a soldier.
<ofna01> no
<Wirisme> Anyone gonna get the MLP comic? I'm thinking about it
<ofna01> like a BLAWK
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Wirisme: I'm not, but that's because I am po.
<ofna01> Oh Kuledud3, <3
<Wirisme> po?
<ofna01> POR QUE?!
<Everlasting_Joy> Poor, and so broke I can't afford the "or".
<Wirisme> Ah :)
<MadSurge> Wirisme: already ordered :D
<MadSurge> FakeSaturn: sorry for the late response, was watching a terrible anime :D But that's a perfect reproduction :D
<Dken2021> how is that comic? any good?
<MadSurge> Dken2021: loosely connected to canon and made by pretty great artists
<Wirisme> Anyone say anything in the last 3 or so minutes? got disconnected
<Everlasting_Joy> Wirisme: No, I don't think so.
<Dken2021> not really, just me asking about the comics
<MadSurge> Dken2021: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/b2c59b6b0b675d0df940601356c20c74.jpg one of those being this artist :3
<Dken2021> oh that's neat
<MadSurge> Wirisme: already ordered the comic:D
<Everlasting_Joy> MadSurge: Luna's got bad breath.
<MadSurge> Everlasting_Joy: you're not the first thinking that :D
<Dken2021> XD rarity's reaction
<Everlasting_Joy> I love it when there are a ton of people just standing in a straight line, all for you to shoot :).
<Wirisme> I wish they'd hurry up and make the show available over here, it's stupid that all the other stuff is (including the comic) but the show itself isn't
<Dken2021> where do you live?
<Wirisme> sunny england
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I must head out for class. I must say, it was kind of nice waking up to this.
<Everlasting_Joy> See y'all in about 3 hours.
<Wirisme> It used to show on boomerang (before I even found it) but they just sort of abandoned it now
<Wirisme> They even took down the FIM page on their site it seems
<Dken2021> huh, well it's not translation issues, I guess they had to do some legal battles I guess

<Everlasting_Joy> Lil_B: I sure hope not!
<Vordox> Mega_Milk: What if the moon had lyrics?
<Gold_Demona> Back then, the credits themes for games were usually just mashups of all the level themes.
<Dken2021> MadSurge I say mother 3 is that exception
<Vordox> or something

<Chrysalis> Hai guys
<Vordox> I'm sad that Brentalfloss had more hits then Duane and Brando. :(
<PeachStreak> hello everypony im home sick today :D
<Dken2021> DnB were ok
<Applejack2012> hi
<Dken2021> allo PeachStreak
<Chrysalis> ohai brental floss
<Vordox> PeachStreak: And that's good? D:
<PONYPOWER> no hes sleeping.
<PeachStreak> Vordox: no school for a day
<Everlasting_Joy> Does it matter? We beat the game! That's what matters.
<Vordox> PeachStreak: That's SAD! D:
<PeachStreak> Vodox: why? a day off
<Vordox> PeachStreak: Which is a HUGE tragedy yes
<MirrorImage> anyone else watching the space jump today?
<Vordox> Missing 1 day in school = Super sad D:
<Dken2021> Everlasting_Joy but that means the game is over ;_;
<PeachStreak> Vodox: why its not tlike the end of the world?
<MadSurge> If the endings we get are all like Mass Effect 3 then I prefer no ending
<Everlasting_Joy> Dken2021: New game + my friend :).
<Vordox> PeachStreak: That's 1 day of missed knowledge
<PONYPOWER> its Complete already.
<Chrysalis> i took a day off work for borderlands
<PONYPOWER> im at the Heavens doors :3
<Chrysalis> completely worth it
<PeachStreak> Vordox: i got the notes for today from all teachers im good
<Vordox> PeachStreak: . ;_; Close enough
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: To be fair, the ending of ME3 is a LOT more tolerable after the EC was added.
<Chrysalis> Gold_Demona thats not a great achievment though
<p4ngya> Chrysalis: i did that on a school day once :D
<doctor_whooves127> teh ned!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I heard that the game still ends horribly :(
<MirrorImage> Gold_Demona - the counterpoint to that is that a good game shouldn't NEED DLC to suddenly become "good"
<Everlasting_Joy> With that Ghostbusters ending, I'm getting AVGN flashbacks.
<p4ngya> Chrysalis: have to say i agree
<flufflepuff> chrono trigger has some great endings
<Chrysalis> the ending was god aweful
<MadSurge> MirrorImage: yep
<PONYPOWER> aint that super right ?

<Gold_Demona> DerpyWhooves: you think THIS is bad? You should see Captain N
<Vordox> Pull out the plunger...
<Barbetos|AtWork> What peach just said reminded me of derpy. "Is there anything we can do to help?" "Anything I can do to help, Rainbow Dash?"
<Vordox> Seriously
<VenHur> Actually, this was made BEFORE Mario 3.
<DerpyWhooves> What's Captain N?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the GAY Master.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly! XD
<VenHur> Before that game, the colors of the Bros's shirt and overalls were reversed.
<Vordox> THAT WAS EASY

*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Fersure> they only have very slight differences in fiscal policy
<Sumica> 00,10it replaces the mann co hat
<sub06905> we should watch the Super mario movie :)
<Fersure> Romney is just far more socially conservative, which is an incredibly bad thing
<Applejack2012> lets have Super Mario movie for B movie
<Mega_Milk> Sumica: And now I must go and mod my mann co hat.....
<DashWithRainbows> Oh, then that's a good reskin then.
<Gold_Demona> ....
<VenHur> ....What the FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWK?!
<Vordox> Fersure: How about..."Remove" president? As in Remove the very politic system you have? :P

<Gold_Demona> I'M A PRETTY LADY!!!~
<Serenity> 'dem male actors
<DashWithRainbows> If it was for a more valuable hat, I doubt I'd go for that skin.
<Sumica> 00,10indeed it is
<Wrek> 05from waht ive seen
<Kandarihu> Fersure, Obama's been screwing up the economy in every way he can, empowering our enemies, alienating our friends. The guy's a friggin' traitor
<Chrysalis> were the genders reversed
<Sumica> 00,10I love the animations she has too
<Chrysalis> there would be some serious legal ramifications
<Fersure> Kandarihu: He has? How?
<Mega_Milk> nice adams apple mario-anna
<Wrek> 05it seems liek the president has no power, and only is but a public figure to keep the people occupied while the senate/congress whatever you call them run the country
<Vordox> Dat theme
*alexxm kidnaps Gold_Demona
<Vordox> WTf
<Gold_Demona> Oh noes! D:

*Gold_Demona is kidnapped
<RAWRity> Wrek: we talking about the US?
<Vordox> Kandarihu: He didn't fuck up the economy =P
<Chrysalis> Seems more like our constitutional monachy Wrek
<Chrysalis> figure head with no real power
<Vordox> Kandarihu: It was fucked up before he eve got in the seat.
<Fersure> The president has executive power.
<Chrysalis> has no choice but to sign stuff
<Fersure> The congress has legislative power.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh my, my mother just bought me an iphone for no apparent reason
<Fersure> The supreme court has judicial power.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm scared
<RAWRity> Basically, this is how the US government's set up: there are 3 branches of power: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: The president has SOME say in things. He pretty much has the final say so on what passes and what doesn't.
<Vordox> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I feel sad for you :P
<Fersure> actually Obama has done tons of good things.
<Sumica> 00,10pants less link
<Maid_RainBow> wow this brings back memorys
<sub06905> Link talks? impossibru!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Vordox i'm scared there is probably bad news coming
<Vordox> Fersure: Like stopping the SOPA act?
<RAWRity> Executive is the President, he has the power to pass or veto laws that are sent to him. A law can't go into effect for the Federal government until the president passes it.
<DaringDerpy> http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/260193_465393553481478_1709650430_n.jpg
<Fersure> oh please, SOPA was dead before it even got to Obama
<Kandarihu> Well, Obama has been ruling by executive orders. The major bills that he got run through Congress pretty much centralizes a lot of the power to the Whitehouse.
<Vordox> Fersure: His Veto stopped it
<Gold_Demona> lol, Accurate, DaringDerpy
<Maid_RainBow> who was the Lugie actor agian?
<Vordox> Wrek: I's so classic isn't it?
<Kandarihu> Vordox, Obama didn't have the chance to veto it.
<Gold_Demona> Um...
<RAWRity> Legislative is Congress. The draft laws, and vote on whether or not to send them to the president. If a bill passes congress, but the president vetoes it, Congress can still pass it if both houses (Representatives and the Senate) get a 2/3 vote to override it.
<Serenity> Mel Gibson
<sub06905> stalkers
<Vordox> Wrek: All the bad stuff = Good stuff, but people only see the bad stuff. :P
<sub06905> do the mario
*Serenity does the mario
<Maid_RainBow> DO THE MARIO!!!
*Gold_Demona does the Mario!~
<Fersure> Sigh.
*Maid_RainBow Does the mario
*sub06905 does the mario also
<DaringDerpy> I think both of them would make decent presidents.
*VenHur Does The Mario also.
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, that's how it's supposed to work. Obamacare was passed by a 50+1 rule.
<Wrek> 05i dont know much about the US political system, and frnakly i dont want to know. what worries me is that health care isnt considered a human right
<RAWRity> Judicial is the supreme court. They interpret laws, and the constitution. They can declare a law or action by the government unconstitutional. The president is in charge of appointing new justices to the Supreme Court when a space opens.
<Fersure> Kandarihu: when it comes to social policies, Romney is like the complete opposite to me
<Serenity> DaringDerpy: Mario for President, Luigi for Prime minister
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Oh true, it was dead as soon as he got it =P
<Maid_RainBow> Sumica NEXT MARIO
<Fersure> his social policies make me sick.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: I don't wanna know how this political system works... And I LIVE here. o_o
<Chrysalis> i find it worrying that people complained when he made it law that insurance has to actually pay out
<RAWRity> Wrek: not exactly. healthcare? yes. Paying for it? not so much.
<sub06905> dat hat
<Wrek> 05guess thats where it slpits
<Chrysalis> pony hat :)
<Vordox> Wrek: Indeed, politics are just fillings... So meh to that. There's plenty of stuff I hate about USA, or how they run things :P
<Vordox> Like Forced Manslaughter...
<Wrek> 05payed for is included in the right
<Wrek> 05otehrwise its not a right
<pony_7274> :D
<sub06905> woo woo
<Wrek> 05then it beocmes a privelege
<Gold_Demona> Dat Applebloom hat...
*Chrysalis buys some apples
<Gold_Demona> I want that Applebloom hat...
<Kandarihu> Vordox, but he didn't even get it. It was put on hold when the major websites went on strike, and quietly put to death later on when it became apparent that it couldn't be snuck through
<Fersure> health care is definitely a human right
<Serenity> I don't.
<Fersure> and Obama has worked hard to defend that belief
<Serenity> I'll be honest with ya, I don't really want ponies in TF2.
<Kandarihu> Fersure, it's not a natural right.
*sub06905 wants a scootaloo hat
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Wasn't that the whole Reddit shutdown time?
<Mega_Milk> Applebloom hat XD
<Mega_Milk> Im getting that hat XD
<Fersure> Kandarihu: well it is.
<Dark_Horst> so uch want
<Vordox> .....
<Shizuka> 13thing is someone has to pay for it
<Vordox> ALL OF THEM
<Mega_Milk> my little pony
<Kandarihu> Vordox, Reddit, Wikipedia, Youtube... I think Facebook to.
<Sumica> 00,10I had to mod the hat a bit so all classes could wear it
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Mucho Gracia to those stances.
<Chrysalis> this just shows
<Chrysalis> minecraft > all things
<Kjakings> 7good god PETA
<Vordox> I FEEL THAT THIS IS BIASED:
<Gold_Demona> Do you like my sword sword!~
<Wrek> 05high taxes arent as scary as people make them otu to be
<Gold_Demona> Sword my diamond sword sword!
<Chrysalis> i can swing my sword sword
<Vordox> Wrek: No shit, we have one of the highest taxes in the world...
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> ..........
<Chrysalis> sword my diamond SWORD SWORD
<Vordox> We're complaining, BUT we get the good things in life :P
<Kandarihu> Wrek, try telling that to the people who are actually paying them.
<AJIsAwesome|Asleep> Well, that happened.
<Gold_Demona> Rainbow licked my finger! :D
<Vordox> Kandarihu: ...We ARE?
<Wrek> 05try having a 33% tax rate
<Chrysalis> damnit Gold_Demona now the songs in my head
<DaringDerpy2> and then flash freezed my system...
<Wrek> 05we do know
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i was supposed to put my finger there? ugh oh...
<DaringDerpy2> goddamit
<Gold_Demona> Chrysalis: LOL, glad I could be of service. XD
<Wrek> 05and i am glad i have that tax
<Mega_Milk> inb4 laugh sfx
<Vordox> Wrek: same.
<Wrek> 05casue i know the benefits that come with it
<Chrysalis> Wrek im supposed to get a payrise soon which will put my on 40%
<Vordox> Wrek: It's a miracle Sweden is where it is in the economy due to the tax alone atm
<VenHur> My Little Pony with laugh tracks...hm....
<VenHur> 20% Cooler?
<Kandarihu> Look. Free Health Care isn't a natural right. A natural right is something that someone can do without anyone interfering. Health Care is something that is provided from the outside. Hence, it's not natural.
<Wrek> 05Chrysalis: how much you make a month?
<Applejack2012> laugh trcks for S3
<Sumica> 00,1025% of my check goes to taxes and othere services wrek

<Serenity> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Wrek> 05enough to live of i hope
<Chrysalis> yeah
<Chrysalis> i got my own place and stuff
<Fersure> there's one tax I hate
<Fersure> and that is sales tax
<Chrysalis> and if i want it i can generally buy it
<Vordox> Wrek: Existens minimum.. ._.
<Fersure> I am completely against sales tax and sin taxes.
<Sumica> 00,10and i live in a state with no state wage tax
<Serenity> What is the original song from Barrel roll?
<Chrysalis> THATS NOT A FUCKING BARREL ROLL
<Fersure> I don't think someone's right to buy on a free market should be discouraged.
<Gold_Demona> lol He-Man
*Chrysalis ends rage
<Serenity> I heard it somehwere, but I forgot it
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Ikr :P
<MadSurge> Oh, Antology 1?
<Sumica> 00,10would be more if I lived in say Califorina
<Fersure> hell, the war on drugs needs to end already
<Vordox> Fersure: War of drugs...*Looks at Sweden* Hmmm.
<Chrysalis> fus
<Chrysalis> ro dah
<Fersure> Vordox: hmm?
<Wrek> 05drugs are prominent here
<Wrek> 05but we dont put people in jail for it
<Fersure> Vordox: I'm not very familiar with Sweden's stance on drugs
<Vordox> Wrek: Yeah but I haven't heard much of it lately...
<Wrek> 05generally
<Wrek> 05as in using
<Kandarihu> Fersure, I guess so. But it needs to be replaced with better education.
<Vordox> Aye, we don't. But I haven't heard in the news for a while about "bigger" Drug headlines.
<Wrek> 05fines, gettign taken care of for detox etc
<Chrysalis> apparently theyre trying to crack down on people heading to amsterdam because weed is legal
<Chrysalis> which is stupid
<Fersure> Kandarihu: well exactly. currently in schools they try telling kids that if they smoke weed they'll die or something.
<Serenity> Is weed legal in Britain?
<Vordox> Chrysalis: here's something for you then.
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Legalize Drugs.
<Serenity> I think it is, isn't it?
<Chrysalis> its a good idea
<Fersure> Kandarihu: if you lie to kids about drugs, they distrist everything you say about them and just use whatever
<Gold_Demona> Aww Spike!~ :)
<Wrek> 05correction
<Chrysalis> legalise and regulate
<Wrek> 05legalize drugs that are less lethal than tobacco
<Applejack2012> lol Spike
<Wrek> 05then ban tobacco
<Vordox> Wrek: XD
<Chrysalis> Wrek but then no alcohol
<Moopy> ban weed also to
<Fersure> I don't think any recreational drugs should be banned
<RAWRity> Wrek: around here it depends on the police/area. In areas where Drug use is big, the cops will look past it unless it's a dealer, or connected to a more serious crime. Other places where it's uncommon usually have the police crack down on it.
<Serenity> Wrek: That'll never happen, most money government makes is tab money
<Vordox> Dat Pinkie
<Fersure> I think they should be regulated and the companies should be taxed.
<Fersure> then we could lower taxes.
<Applejack2012> You gotta share
<Fersure> for everyone.
<Vordox> Lower taxes?
<Vordox> Really?
<Serenity> Plus tab isn't all that lethal, it's the tar and niccotine mainly
<Fersure> sure.
<Vordox> Why earn and then lose, Fersure?
<Fersure> by legalising recreational drugs, absolutely.
<Wrek> 05ratehr keep the same tax
<Kandarihu> City governments are trying to crack down on sugar.
<Wrek> 05and spend the extra money on improving the service
<Wrek> 05no?
<donutpop365> MadSurge: What's the difference between lo and il? Sorry, Rosetta Stone isn't the greatest.
<Fersure> what?
<Vordox> You need a plus on things, not cuts.
<Fersure> why lower taxes?
<Fersure> because if you lower taxes more people spend.
<Vordox> Fersure: Yes, why?
<Fersure> and if more people spend the economy grows.
<Vordox> Yeah but if Governemnt can't spend, why should the people?
<Vordox> It'll offbalance.
<Kjakings> 7their research into the actual game mechanics can't be faulted. Ghetsis' electrocution attack wasn't very effective against snivy
<Fersure> well government needs a ton of cuts.
<Chrysalis> drop politicians wages
<Chrysalis> or drop expenses
<Fersure> but they're cutting the wrong things.
<Chrysalis> so much money saved
<Vordox> I'm suprised we're having this discussion in a sensible way. <3
<Kandarihu> The government has a ton of useless programs.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: That I can agree with...
<Dken2021> that they do
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: That's because this chat is awesome. <3
<Wrek> 05im not suprised i havent stopped hugging twilie
<Vordox> Wrek: STILL!?
<Vordox> Wrek: You'll smother her.
<Gold_Demona> I'm not either, Wrek :)
*Chrysalis dances
*Vordox headbangs
<MadSurge> donutpop365: mainly sound and letters assonance. "Il cane" sounds better than "Lo Cane" :D
<doctor_whooves127> give me the music
<Sumica> 00,10wrek will love that plushie forever and ever and ever
<frakturfreak> The income of the state is in direct relation to its spendings
<Chrysalis> and the rest of that song is terribad
*Serenity has been falling constantly for 2 minutes now
<Vordox> frakturfreak: Eeyup
<Chrysalis> this is the only good bit of the song
<frakturfreak> cutting costs doesn’t help
<Wrek> 05heres a thought
<Gold_Demona> Just one?
<Vordox> Wow, RD spins alot.
<Wrek> 05theres no such thign as profit when it comes to a goverment. theres income and expense.
<Kjakings> 7OH GOOD GOD ASH XD
<donutpop365> MadSurge: Oh, so it really doesn't matter? Okay then, that's confusing :P and what would L' be?
<Kjakings> 7Nice hat
<Bronysith> Heres my solution to American government... LESS IDIOTS IN GOVERNMENT
<Vordox> Wrek: Err. Norway? :P
<donutpop365> MadSurge: And basically just asthetics then.
<Fersure> the problem is they try to cut the wrong things
<Gold_Demona> Candy Mountain! :D
<Fersure> they cut education
<Fersure> they cut all this stupid shit
<Wrek> 05also
<Fersure> instead of cutting politicians wages
<Wrek> 05lending roofs
<Fersure> and the DoD
<Stormy> haha
<Kjakings> 7ah but ash's pikachu never goes inside it's pokeball
<Gold_Demona> Applejack has best poker face
<Shizuka> 13ah politics..
<Wrek> 05and you wouldtn be in this situation in the first place
<Kjakings> 7so close, PETA
<Shizuka> 13land of the uninformed
<Kencolt> Bronysith: Um... not so easy, since WE PICK THE IDIOTS.
<Fersure> how about the US only has troops in the US?
<Fersure> that would save a ton of money
<Vordox> Not sure on what Lending Roofs are, but I can guess by the name
<Stormy> I like how they have attacks like "Protest" and "Educate"
<Vordox> Balance Economy = good stuff happens. :P That's all I know
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, I agree. Problem is, the idiots have 90% control of the mainstream media, the entertainment industry, and academia.
<Gold_Demona> For PIIIIIIE!~
<Wrek> 05basically "past this point we will not lend more money"
<sub06905> did i miss Wrek showing his twilight plushie D:
<doctor_whooves127> lol family guy disney version
<Dken2021> Bronysith yea, too many old geezer who are kinda not with the times, heck none of them are not sure how technology can benefit people
<Wrek> 05"but save isntead"
<Fersure> I think the US needs a balanced budget amendment to their constitution
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: i blame MTV
<Kandarihu> Fersure, hear hear!
<MadSurge> donutpop365: it does matter, because they only go with certain names. L' is for names that start with a vowel
<Stormy> And some of them actually do damage
<Fersure> Kandarihu: I also believe bills should only be allowed to be x pages long
<Fersure> and must be in plain English
*Vordox does the Mambo
<Serenity> Shoo be doo
<Vordox> Nooo!
<Vordox> S:
<Vordox> SUMI!
<Applejack2012> shoo be doo!
*sub06905 calls upon the sea ponies
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, but is MTV even popular any more?
<alexxm> so is there still a stream
<Stormy> Yes let's fight violence against "animals" with violence against humans, what a great idea
<Fersure> that's like the only reason I'm against obama care
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: jersey shore
<Vordox> Fersure: THESE DAMN BILLS ARE TOO LONG
<Gold_Demona> I think most of the problem in this country is that Congress doesn't have finite terms like the President does. We should be allowed to boot their asses out of their congressional seats after a set number of years.
<Fersure> I don't believe one bill should be able to spend so much
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, point taken
<donutpop365> Oh, okay then, thanks a ton!
<Shizuka> 13 would be nice if the politicians actually read the bills they pass
<Fersure> Vordox: THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH
<Vordox> Fersure: Ah thank you XD I forgot the famous quote

<Wrek> 05if human rigths were global
<Stormy> I was slightly impressed that someone had apparently bothered to do their research, though
<Mega_Milk> Shizuka: hahaha XD
<Gold_Demona> I'm for creating a new political party. Imma call it the BIRTHDAY PARTY! Cake and presents for everypony!~
<Wrek> 05us would have proper healthcare
<Vordox> If only Wrek....
<Vordox> Not just US :P
<Mega_Milk> Shizuka: The drive by thing? -lol
<Dark92Enigma> Here's a Nostalgic song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if_0SNR-7SE
<Shizuka> 13but wrek, people come from all over the world to here exactly *for* our healthcare
<Kandarihu> I generally consider the act of sharing and accepting that which has been shared is a natural right.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: and NC's review made me love the show even MORE
<Stormy> or at least play one of the games for more than five seconds
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: Pffftt health care? If you break an arm in the US you lost an arm.
<Vordox> Dark92Enigma: LAWL love the pic with the ponies
<Shizuka> 13penn has it right, there's great joy in helping others, but no joy in doing it under penalty of law
<Vordox> Shizuka: And how's that going?
<Wrek> 05point is
<Applejack2012> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84PZbL_-jjU
<Kandarihu> Mega_Milk, the best health care in the world is still not Miracles of God.
<Panda|Drawing> dat Sumica quit
<Mega_Milk> Kandarihu: When I think health care. I think. Bandage.
<Wrek> 05goverment should provide proper healthcare for its citizens. covered in expense with no profit by taxes. and if the wealthier bunch wish to buy via private companies then go right on ahead.
<Wrek> 05that is my view of said matter
<Shizuka> 13Mega_Milk: if you break an arm in the us you go to a hospital and they brace it
<Mega_Milk> Kandarihu: Not miracle of god -lol
<Shizuka> 13hospitals are not allowed to refuse care
<Vordox> Wrek: A socionorm balance of Left/Right wing?
<Kjakings> 7they at least looked up Ghetsis
<Shizuka> 13but care costs money, someone has to pay for it
<Mega_Milk> Shizuka: Yeeeeaaaahhhhh come to my "Neck of the woods"
<JRP2234> eewwww carbon tax
<Shizuka> 13considering social security and medicare are so horrendously broken that they're something like 70% of our deficit alone...
<donutpop365> Gotta go, bye!
<donutpop365> Ciao, everypony.
<Applejack2012> bye
<Wrek> 05Shizuka not saying its being done right
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, donutpop365. :)
<Shizuka> 13it's what happens when you tell someone "you don't need to work for yourself, someone else will do it for you"
<Wrek> 05im sayign how its suppsoed to work
<DaringDerpy2> the us have three times the health care costs as other developed countries. but the results of the us system are still sub average. it needs reforms. urgently
<Mega_Milk> donutpop365: Later.
<Vordox> Wrek: An alternative way of making it work, Wrek. :P
<Wrek> 05ill be goign live soon
<Vordox> There's bad sides with our system as well
<Wrek> 05Vordox: im not sayign it isnt
<Serenity> Only government system that isn't fucked up is Salamias
<Mega_Milk> the system is broke yo.
<Kandarihu> Wrek, alright. I'm gonna exempt your plushie from my pony fast.
<Vordox> Wrek: I know, but the way you said it, may have cuased some confusion making it sound like we are doing it right(It works for us though so far)
<Bronysith> Wrek: planetside 2 time?
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, I don't mind my current government. I mean, they lie through their teeth, but it seems people have figured that out by now.
<Vordox> I say, we live like in Equestria
<Vordox> Everyone doing what they want
<Vordox> WE WIN
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, that'll work fine.
<Vordox> Wrek: Mind I show you a video before you go stream?
<DaringDerpy2> show me a politician who doesn't lie and I show you a truly talented liar
<Wrek> 05sure
<Vordox> DaringDerpy2: Carl Bildt
<Kjakings> 7B+, PETA. Close, but not quite.
<Vordox> Or Olof Palme
<Wrek> 05^
<Kammerjunk> Vermin Supreme.
<Serenity> Aww Christ
<Wrek> 05Vordox: or dag hammarsjöld
<Jmo> HAHA Vermin Spreme.
<Vordox> Oh yeah, Dag.
<Kammerjunk> Supreme is a pretty cool guy.
<Vordox> But for god sake...
<Jmo> We have a wimmer.
<Vordox> Avoid...
<Serenity> Why am I eating Corn flakes when I have tongselitus
<Vordox> Göran Persson...
<Vordox> He WAS good but so much under the table
<Shizuka> 13in other news
<Shizuka> 13uh
<Jmo> winner*
<Wrek> 05dony you agree Vordox?
<Kammerjunk> Serenity: I don't know, why -are- you eating cornflakes when you have tongselitus?
<Vordox> Wrek: Whut, Dony?
<Serenity> Because I'm hungry, and we have no soup
<Kandarihu> You know what? I've been thinking of what it would be if Mitt Romney actually cut off tax subsities to PBS. It's basically privatization. And Sesame Street is enough of a household name to survive without government funding.
<Wrek> 05<@Wrek> Vordox: or dag hammarsjöld
<Vordox> Agree with what exactly?
<DaringDerpy> the only one of them I know is Vermin Supreme :P
<Wrek> 05also
<Bronysith> Shizuka: pie tastes good?
<Wrek> 05quick question
<Vordox> Haven't heard anything bad from him... so yea I guess
<Shizuka> 13eh depends on the pie
<Serenity> And it hurts more than getting a white hot ballistic knife in my foot
<Wrek> 05are ther any goverment funded or goverment owned uhm.. organizatiosn or companies etc. that are goign with profit in the US?
<Kandarihu> So really. He doesn't want Big Bird to die. He wants Big Bird to fly
<Dken2021> Serenity ouch
<Wrek> 05if yes: then there's a problem
<Vordox> >.>
<Vordox> Isn't that a common issue around the world atm, Wrek?
<Kandarihu> Uh........ my ISP.
<Dken2021> hai Phase4!
<Vordox> Oh, Government FUNDED; nvm
<Shizuka> 13gov owned? every last one is paying out more than they take in
<Kandarihu> Well, it's kinda run by the municipal government of Chattanooga TN
<Serenity> Makes me wonder
<Shizuka> 13gov funded, depends on the percentage
<Lil_B> and I'm back :)
<Serenity> What would the world be like if the Queen had all the political power rather than the government like 1000 years ag
<Dken2021> welcome back Lil_B and Sumica
<Shizuka> 13monarchies don't scale
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, Lil_B and Sumica. :)
<Shizuka> 13little thing called america proved that
<Fersure> don't scale?
<Vordox> Serenity: You mean like PResident? :P
<Kandarihu> Serenity, the hockey stick of human prosperity would never become a hockey stick
<Lil_B> Serenity you mean more like 200 years ago?
<Randomnerd> Hey all
<Kammerjunk> Serenity: I don't want to know. I don't even like Denmark having a royal house without any actual power.
<Serenity> Lil_B: King John
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Power?
<Lil_B> thanks Dken2021 and AJIsAwesome :)
<Serenity> He signed a very large parchment
<Kammerjunk> ...I ran out of words.
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Does a person that has the face of the land, really need power?
<Randomnerd> I have an interview tomorrow, if I get the job, I will flood the world with MUFFINS.
<MadSurge> Ewww politics
<Serenity> Giving some political power to the parliment
<Randomnerd> I don't know how, really, but I'll do it!
<Vordox> Randomnerd: Good luck!
<Randomnerd> Thanks, Vordox
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Oh, nobody actually likes them, they just act like brats.
<Lil_B> Randomnerd Job at the Local Bakery?
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Hehe. :P Like Prince...Harry was it?
<Serenity> If you was a Brit, Lil_B. You'd be smacked for not knowing that :P
<Randomnerd> Lil_B: lol
<AJIsAwesome> Randomnerd: Best of luck. Also, make sure tgey're different flavored muffins every now and then. :)
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Who, the Danish prince?
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Someone named Prince Harry cause ruckus alot
<Shizuka> 13here we go
<Serenity> Vordox: "Someone"
<Randomnerd> Oh, royals.
<Serenity> Prince Harry rocks, mate.
<Shizuka> 13in other news http://fav.me/d5hdxl0
<Vordox> Like our famous Victoria who drove around iN Stockholms walking streets, remember that Wrek? :D
<Kammerjunk> Possibly England. I dunno, our prince is called Henrik, and he's a downright douche.
<Wrek> 05all i remember is the nudes
<Vordox> Oh...
<Vordox> Errr
<Vordox> I missed that on purpose. :P Private life is private life
<Serenity> Everyone hates Harry because he fucked a woman and was caught on camera, which shouldn't have even been there
<Kandarihu> Not sure what to vote for on A Movie
<Wrek> 05it was practically thrown in my face
<Wrek> 05litterally
<Randomnerd> Well, here in the states, we get to pick our rulers and they still suck :P
<Shizuka> 13oh wrek
<Shizuka> 13i think you need to give twi your glasses
<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d52xevf
<Vordox> Randomnerd: Vote Ron Paul, DO A change for god sake :P
<Vordox> Better have a Risk then fall
<Randomnerd> And considering we have "political dynasties", we might as well have royals.
<Randomnerd> Vordox: I'm voting third party, don't worry about that.
<Kammerjunk> Change?! Ya got change?!
<Lil_B> Serenity well, I know enough to know that most english Kings and Qeenes from mid 18th to WW1 came from Hannover :P
<Vordox> Of course...
<Vordox> SAYING "We can CHANGE" is not "a change" when there IS no "change" Obama.
<Randomnerd> Besides, I live in NY state, so the state is going to Obama anyway.
<Serenity> IMO, I beleive that the motto for every government party in the world should be "LETS FUCK UP DA PLANET"
<Kandarihu> Randomnerd, voting 3rd party is pretty much tantamount to not voting at all
<Vordox> Serenity: Hehe
<Randomnerd> There aren't enough pissed-off democrats in the state to turn away from Obama.
<Vordox> It's a shame ROn Paul won't go into the next election
<Randomnerd> Kandarihu: It depends. Not voting at all is the only mistake you can make.
<Vordox> Cause that guy had the sense of a governemnt President for over 30 years
<Vordox> But was presse down by... well everything
<RAWRity> eeyup. In the history of the US there has been a grand total of ONCE that a third party has effected the election in any significant way. And that 3rd party had to be lead by Teddy Roosevelt.
<Randomnerd> Our system's math forces a two party system.
<Vordox> He foretold stuff that happened within 10-30 years...
<Vordox> And STILL noone listened, GEEZ.
<Shizuka> 13paul's biggest problem is his foreign policy (sticking your fingers in your ears and going LALALALA doesn't make things go away) and his followers
<Shizuka> 13of all the fandoms on the internet, ron paul fans are the most rabid i've seen
<Vordox> Shizuka: I know, but why is that bad?
<Randomnerd> A third party only gains power if one of the two parties is dying.
<Kandarihu> Randomnerd, or voting without getting all the facts together. Did you know that there are people in some states who have ALREADY voted without even watching the debates?
<Jmo> Oh I forgot you were around DWR.
<DashWithRainbows> Nope.
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Well, nobody listened wen Morgan Robertson foretold the whole Titanic thing.
<DashWithRainbows> Not here.
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349750350745.gif
<Kammerjunk> when*
<Jmo> dwr pls
<RAWRity> Shizuka: yeah, Paul became the Candidate for slightly jaded college kids who wanted to seem progressive.
<Randomnerd> Kandarihu: Some people have to, like Service Personnel.
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: Touché to that as well
<DashWithRainbows> I will be gone for a while though Joomay
<Jmo> aww
<DashWithRainbows> Gonna go for a night walk
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<Kandarihu> Randomnerd, good point.
<Shizuka> 13the problem with the voting process around here is it guarantees a two party system
<Jmo> Night?
<Vordox> DashWithRainbows: Be careful.
<DashWithRainbows> No.
<Randomnerd> Shizuka: Pretty much.
<Jmo> What bloody time is it?
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: This.
<Shizuka> 13voting third party just takes a vote away from whichever of the big two is closest to you
<Vordox> Shizuka: If you don't like it, change it, We change all the stuff here in Sweden for most of the time when it's defective. :P
<Shizuka> 13which makes the other guy win
<Randomnerd> I wish we had Instant Run-Off voting.
<Randomnerd> You vote in order of preference.
<Wrek> 05stream will start in 8 mins

<Randomnerd> The Australians have a good idea.
<Jmo> Kandarihu*
<Vordox> Randomnerd: What's their system?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: eeyup. Back in the day, a lot of republicans voted for the Bullmoose party. The result was that the Dems won it.
<Kammerjunk> Jmo: Goddammittabkey?
*Jmo slaps Kammerjunk around a bit with a large trout
<Vordox> OH OH OH!

<Panda|Drawing> Wrek, erm... can I talk to ya a little later?
<Shizuka> 13it's funny seeing articles on /r/libertarian saying "if we can get gary johnson 5% it'll be historic and send a message" and i'm thinking.... perot got 17%, it just handed a second term to clinton
<Kandarihu> I agree with Shizuka. Ron Paul's economic policy would be the best for America. Ron Paul's foreign policy would be the worst for America
<JRP2234> is 10 table sppons of sugar in cerial to much?
<Yahooz> lawl Ross Perot
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: WUT
<Jmo> Toodles browniestate.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: it's /r/ what else would you expect?
<Shizuka> 13well true
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Jaymoo. :3
<Randomnerd> Vordox: Basically, you pick two parties, if your first choice wins, that's the end of it, if they lose, your vote goes to your second choice.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: What's wrong with foreign policy?
<killerpony7733> Jmo Bye D:
<Shizuka> 13/r/mylittlepony is good though :3
<Serenity> Anyway
<Serenity> Question: Why are we talking about politics?
<Randomnerd> Therefore, you can vote for someone without "throwing your vote away".
<Shizuka> 13oh you're thinking 4chan, i mean reddit
<Kandarihu> Vordox, he hates Israel
<Yahooz> Serenity: we arent
<Wrek> 05hashtag!
<Vordox> Kandarihu: He does?
<Vordox> HOW DO HE HATE ISRAEL!?
<Shizuka> 13hashtag!
<Randomnerd> I'm talking about Poli Sci.
<Yahooz> hashtagYoloSwagmoney
<Shizuka> 13why are we yelling hashtag..
<Vordox> All I heard from him was that they deserve what they HAVE.
<Serenity> TAGHASH
<Shizuka> 13TASHHAG
<Wrek> 05hash
<Vordox> IF Usa leaves.
<Wrek> 05i want hash
<Randomnerd> As near as I can tell, no one is aware who I'm voting for.
<Lil_B> hashtag Sonicgetstothegrocerystoreandgetssomebread
<Serenity> Hash brown
<Dken2021> Poundsign!
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, because the # turns the hashtag into a channel name
<DaringDerpy> can we have some stream while you discuss your election campaigns here?
<Shizuka> 13well yeah
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Tell me where he says he "Hates" Israel.
<Bronysith> MUFFINS
<Yahooz> Hushtug
<Lil_B> Wrek take this: #
<Kandarihu> Vordox, that's what I've heard
<Wrek> 05i want hashish. so i can go do hashassinations
<Shizuka> 13anyhoof UPS needs to put GPS trackers on their planes/trucks so i can watch where my new phone is realtime
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<Yahooz> and then Wrek had a lisp
<killerpony7733> DaringDerpy If a mod can and want to. Surely but else it's up to if the mod is able to
<Vordox> Kandarihu: There's a fun thing what you heard and what he means
<Brad[Laptop]> Shizuka what phonedid you order
<Lil_B> hasse haschisch inner tasche hasste immer was zu nasche
<Randomnerd> It's the result that matters, not the Intent.
<Bronysith> Yahooz: you are going to want to kill me
<Shizuka> 13i don't care it departed louisville kentucky on sunday night WHERE IS IT NOW
<Vordox> Kandarihu: He MAY go "lalalal" but really, if the land cannot take care of it self,it needs to progress on it's own merits
<Yahooz> how so?
<Yahooz> 
<Vordox> WHAT is what he meant Kandarihu
<Vordox> THAT*S
<Dken2021> and once again, I'm lost in the conversation
<killerpony7733> Wrek Oi gonna go back in PS2 anytime soon? NC is currently being a little pushed since we had a breach in our defenses from the TR and suddenly the VS
<Bronysith> Yahooz: i had chipotle for lunch
<Shizuka> 13Brad[Laptop]: htc one s, we're moving to t-mobile and replacing all our phones
<Yahooz> FUCK
<Yahooz> OFF >:(
<Brad[Laptop]> Shizuka My dad has the one s, its a great phone.
<Serenity> Shizuka: Buy an extra battery with it
<Brad[Laptop]> very nice design.
<Yahooz> ;___; now im hungry
<Shizuka> 13can't remove the battery
<Brad[Laptop]> Thats true, and no sd card slot
<Serenity> Seriously, HTC phones have got battery lives like bloody HP laptops
<Shizuka> 13depending on how fast it drains i don't think it'll be a problem
<killerpony7733> Serenity Probably due to the hardware in it.
<Brad[Laptop]> my dad uses his for business and it lasts the day
<Brad[Laptop]> it lasts longer than my iphone 5 battery
<Shizuka> 13i figure i'll have it charge on asuka every night anyways
<killerpony7733> First gen iphone that has been used enough can have a battery that lasts for longer then a day
<killerpony7733> Only upside
<Randomnerd> Also, any party that gets 5% of the popular vote in the US gains a lot of advantages.
<Brad[Laptop]> the only problem is that you have to use a first gen iphone :P
<Dken2021> and no one cares about those anymore :P
<Randomnerd> They get to be on ballots in all states, for starters.
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back.....and my hooves hurt, because my mom made me search for her keys and i can't walk for a while
<Vordox> STREAAAAAM
<Vordox> Dem glassses
<killerpony7733> Brad[Laptop] In how reliable it is and how long it can be used without charging is god damn good. But yeah it's mostly beaten in terms of a whole key of things
<Dken2021> even though they do the same thing you did for your newer iphones: talk on phone and browse facebook
<Kandarihu> Vordox, ... I guess I was wrong about Ron Paul on Israel.
<Vordox> How are you going to draw art Wrek with only one hand
<Bronysith> Wrek: like a boss
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Stop govern the world <-- One of his messages.
<Lil_B> We czurrently have the Problem in germany that nobody votes anymore, we recetnly had electiuons for our Region and less than 50% of the poeple actually voted
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Anyway, it's too late, too much slander caused Ron Paul to lose his way on the economy
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Where USA is headed now is... Well where's it going. :(
<Randomnerd> Lil_B: We're in a bad spot here, too.
<Moopy> Wrek WTF was that?
<Dken2021> Lil_B oh dear, sounds like a big problem
<Brad[Laptop]> In china, you vote for the communist party.
<MadSurge> :O ART
<Randomnerd> People feel rather helpless, presumably.
<Vordox> Double Glasses?
<Kandarihu> Vordox, but the Federal Reserve is getting investigated now, though. So he kinda IS getting some headway.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Oh shit...
<MadSurge> :D DAT PLUSHIE
<Sylandest> wow, that plushie looks great
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Inb4 Shit hits the fan....
<Sylandest> great detail to it
<Queen_Chrysalis> mew?
<Kandarihu> Vordox, I sure hope it does.
<Vordox> DEAL with TWILIGHT
<Vordox> YEAAAAH
<Randomnerd> It's especially frustrating for me because I'm a supporter of the ACLU. No man can control the economy, but one man SHOULD NOT have the power of life and death over the citizenry.
<Brad[Laptop]> and the us dollar is basically worthless.
<Queen_Chrysalis> hi all
<Lil_B> Dken2021 yeah, because when all the normal people vote anymore, only the radical people (the very left or very right parties) become percentagye wise more votes and these are really not the type you want to have as your government
<Dken2021> hey Queen_Chrysalis
<Randomnerd> Hi, Queen_Chrysalis
<Vordox> Wrek: need inspiration?
<Invi> Wrek that looks so awesome :D
<Bronysith> Wrek: fallout pony?
<Vordox> So...
<killerpony7733> Vordox My view on politics really goes. The one who can shout the loudest and give the ''best'' solution without any thinking of the long term issues and all is those who get in charge of things
<Kandarihu> Brad[Laptop], it will be worthless if the current Quantitative Easing isn't stopped soon.
<Vordox> Something POny related....
<alexxm> how are things Queen_Chrysalis
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Risk all and lose all? ;)
<Chrysalis> i get pinged?
<Lil_B> Draw something... good :) well.. I guess thats the usuall state anyway xD
<Queen_Chrysalis> im ok alex
<killerpony7733> Vordox Too damn scary but very true.
<Randomnerd> killerpony7733: Exactly, how could someone not feel helpless under such conditions?
<Chrysalis> oh, nvm
<Lil_B> ohai Chrysalis and killerpony7733
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Hey, a change > No change :P
<Vordox> Wrek: What about ... Make THE Swedish Pony. :D
<Dken2021> Lil_B dang, that explains alot then
<killerpony7733> Vordox Problem is how our overall political systems work today.
<Bronysith> Look at Wrek sitting there with his plush
<Queen_Chrysalis> -pokes the twilight plusheh-

<sonicdude558|HW> anything of that nature I guess
<sonicdude558|HW> crap
<sonicdude558|HW> my mom's alarm is going off

<sonicdude558|HW> Not really

<Kawaii_icybeauti> sonicdude558|HW: Wat? Well, the only scar I have is the one I got when my brother closed a stroller on my hand.
<Petrified_Discord> So you need to get a scar tonight.
<taoumi> this one time i was building my first computer
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> What did you cut it on?
<Petrified_Discord> sonicdude558|HW: See if there are any sharks nearby, or maybe you could fight a knife-wielding theif
<taoumi> and i was poping out the metal plates to put in a cd drive
<taoumi> this was bac whe nthey made nice computer boxes
<himself> "i needed to write a story about a scar, but i didnt have a scar, so i got one. The End."
<taoumi> so i pushe and it went BANG and it came out
<sonicdude558|HW> lol I did mine on some kid kicking me because I was staring at his iPod Touch
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Should I start my homework or do more interwebz?
<sonicdude558|HW> hm
<thelonepony> hw
<sonicdude558|HW> 7:38
<taoumi> i was going to pop out another one so i left my hand inside the box
<taoumi> so my hand starts to feal warm
<himself> Kawaii_icybeauti: do homework while theres no stream, its your only hope
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Kawaii_icybeauti: Homework.
<sonicdude558|HW> HW
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I dunno, I actually came up here orginally to do an assingment that I did. But if I go downstairs, my mum will see me and make me leave computer.
<sonicdude558|HW> Alarm again.
<Petrified_Discord> When I was 4 I somersaulted onto a rock. With my face. Scar's gone now. :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wait, I'll sneak downstairs BRB
<taoumi> i wonder what is going on so i pull out my hand and there is blood coating my arm hlaf way down my forarm
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Have some music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ElwJZhZx6I&feature=relmfu
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> taoumi: Ouch.
<taoumi> i go into the living room and my mom goes...."eeeyup you severd an artery alright"
<taoumi> so we clean it up and i get bandaged. and so now every time i build a computer i give it a little blood sacrifice
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> How much did it hurt?
<Petrified_Discord> .................yaaaaaaaaaaaaay
<taoumi> actualy it didn't hurt at all whe nit happend
<taoumi> cleanign it up hurt more then geting it
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> That's interesting.
<taoumi> i jsut though i had bumbped my hand on the top of the box
<Kawaii_icybeauti> okay...Should I start with a journal entry on what life was like in ancient egypt or do meth?
<sonicdude558|HW> lol
<himself> you severed an artery by bumping your hand on a box?
<taoumi> eeeyup
<himself> that doesnt seem legit..
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'll do ancient egypt.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Kawaii_icybeauti: First choice.
<sonicdude558|HW> ... You are talking about your http://i50.tinypic.com/15i6qog.jpg stories right? lol
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome|Reading: I was going to do that. I hate math.
<taoumi> how is cuting you hand o nthe sarp metal on the inside of an older computer box not legit?
<taoumi> when you are pushing hard to pop out a metal plate?
<himself> i think you might be mistaken on severing the artery part
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Kawaii_icybeauti: You typed "meth". ;d
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> *:D
<Petrified_Discord> Secret computer box ninjas. With swords.
<taoumi> no i'm very sure it was an artery
<taoumi> it was under presure and spurting
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome|Reading: I spell it like that because it's like that; It's harmful in huge doeses.
<taoumi> and the rate that it bleed is also a dead ringer for artery
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Ok. :d
<himself> taoumi: and you didnt even have to go to the doctor?
<taoumi> my mom is a doctor so wer just kinda patched it up
<taoumi> she asked if i wanted to go in to get sticked but i said nah
<taoumi> stiches*
<sonicdude558|HW> lol wow
<sonicdude558|HW> Your mom is a doctor
<sonicdude558|HW> that is neat

<Ponies47> Ohai Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Ponies47.
<DERP-Pony> bye people
<Canadian_Brony> seeya DERP-Pony
<thelonepony> bye DERP-Pony
<sonicandmario85> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJJ-QkZ8cM LISTEN TO IT
<himself> dat instrumental music
<Petrified_Discord> Dude, pokemon could get creepy as fuck
<Dken2021> especially the pokemon tower
<sonicandmario85> its from the offical game
<Petrified_Discord> Like, remember that girl that's just crying in the middle of nowhere with that Hypno?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Meh. Never found Lavender Town scary.
<Petrified_Discord> And then you read Hypno's pokedex entry
<Petrified_Discord> O_O
<himself> sonicandmario85: well duh. youve never played it, have you
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Petrified_Discord: Yeah. That was interesting. :D
<sonicandmario85> himself:ye si have
<superretroworld> POP POP
<taoumi> pbpbppbpbppbb
<Cypresswolf> I remember being creeped out a bit the first time I got to lavender Town - you're going along with the challenge, cheery music most of the time - then that music :) what a mood switch that was
<sonicandmario85> the songs even on fire red
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Yeah, it was. :D
<Lunar_Brony> I hate having to ghost.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> ^
<sonicandmario85> having to ghost? wtf?
<Lunar_Brony> Canadian_Brony is "taken"
<Petrified_Discord> I also have never liked ghosting.
<sonicandmario85> theres a ghost feature?
<Lunar_Brony> no
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> It basically means when you can't choose your original nick for a while.
<superretroworld> does lavender town have that scary music that gave somee ppl brain seizures?
<Petrified_Discord> I seriously don't think Pokemon has explored the ramification where ghosts are a real an accepted fact.
<Cypresswolf> then the talk of Team Rocket killing a pokemon O_o and a graveyard...made me believe my pokemon could actually die from being wiped out in battle too many times
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Ah yes, the dead Marowak.
<sonicandmario85> yea in black and white they removed the music and put happier music in lavender town
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Took me forever to realize that you needed to get the Super Scope.
<himself> lavender town is in black and white?
<thelonepony> ^
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> sonicandmario85: Shh. I haven't played Black 2/ White 2 yet.
<Dken2021> uh...lavender town is in kanto....
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Petrified_Discord> Like, remember back when there were only 3 ghost pokemon? It's heavily implied that when pokemon die THEY BECOME THEM. What about humans? Do THEY become ghosts? Do they become POKEMON? What's even the point of ghost stories where GHOSTS ARE REAL. And you can CATCH THEM. And they have SPECIAL ATTACKS. ...And they smile.
<sonicandmario85> AJIsAwesome|Reading:i meant the first one...
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Do you mean, HG/SS?
<Dken2021> unless you mean gold and silver, then yes
<Cypresswolf> that top comment "Fun Fact: The music isn't instrumental.It's actually the hundreds of cries of numerous Pokemons' ghosts.So you're actually surrounded by hundreds of ghosts whilst﻿ visiting Lavender Town."
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Petrified_Discord: That's a very interesting theory.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Cypresswolf: .........
<himself> sonicandmario85: so youre saying lavender is in black and white 1?
<sonicandmario85> yes i think so atleast
<Dken2021> http://derpy.me/xB0dp
<himself> i dont think it is
<Petrified_Discord> Well it is on the gameboy so it IS in black and white :P
<sonicandmario85> i saw a lets play showing it
<himself> Dken2021: hory sheet
<Kawaii_icybeauti> IMMMMMMM DOOOOONNNNEEEEEE!!!!;)
<sonicandmario85> you know the black and white thats 3D?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Kawaii_icybeauti: Yay! :3
<Dken2021> XD: Gale of darkness?
<Cypresswolf> original Red & Blue didnt have color - color started showing in yellow I think
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> ^
<Petrified_Discord> Pokemon Yellow: now in A color
<Cypresswolf> :D
<Dken2021> actually, they had color if you put them in a super gameboy
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> :D
<taoumi> blue was all blueish brown
<Petrified_Discord> Soopa doopa gameboy
<taoumi> and red was al lredish brown
<himself> ruby/sapphire was so awesome. i still remember how groudon/kyogre took over the world
<Petrified_Discord> Pokemon: Reddish-brown didn't sell as well, though
<Petrified_Discord> Dude when I first got pokemon ruby and the motherfucking cartridge was see-through red I nearly flipped my shit
<sonicdude558> Wow, the buffer show is still going? Thats odd
<sonicandmario85> oh i think the happier lavender town music wasnt in black and white it was in another ed pokemon game...well one that has 3d graphics
<Kawaii_icybeauti> himself: I had the most awesome ruby, but I lost it :(
<sonicdude558> btw I finished my hw
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Valve Playtester Survey coool
<sonicandmario85> 3d*
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> I got conned out of Sapphire as a kid. :|
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome|Reading: You mean someone took it?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> No.
<sonicdude558> yo himself are you still there?
<himself> Kawaii_icybeauti: yeh that sucks
<dynamo2814> nothing streaming?
<sonicdude558> good
<himself> sonicandmario85: that is possible
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Someone traded me Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories for it. :|
<thelonepony> that sucks AJIsAwesome|Reading
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome|Reading: Boooooooooo
<Cypresswolf> I had several pokemon from my original ruby & sapphire game on my crystal version - but that game no longer works - doesnt keep a saved game anymore
<Petrified_Discord> I mean it's no ruby or emerald, but still. Fukken chain or memories?
<himself> salamence is best pokemon
<Petrified_Discord> himself: I think you mean gengar
<sonicdude558> yo Cypresswolf get a 3.5 gamebit, rip it open and solder a new battery
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Petrified_Discord: I know. *sigh*
<Cypresswolf> not Ruby/Sapphire...gold & silver .... ah I dont remember which gen crystal was part of - too many pokemon games now
<himself> salamence>gengar. salamence is an uber after all
<himself> i forget if they banned ubers from multiplayer though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 Shizuka did you see dis :3 http://www.joystiq.com/2012/10/09/valve-looking-for-hardware-testers-rate-how-well-you-like-valve/
<Cypresswolf> I'm still looking foward to a pokemon game that has all the regions, all the pokemon and sub locations in one version - Pokemon Overdose
<Petrified_Discord> See, I still have my Gengar from Ruby. The reason I still have it is because I noticed that this particular Gengar would kill everything and never die. It was only until Diamond/Pearl that I found out what IV's were and lo and behold, motherfucker's got perfect IV's.
<Dken2021> himself http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qe9O90cD80&t=30s
<Cypresswolf> :D I doubt I'd have the patience to get through it
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Petrified_Discord: Nice.
<Phase4> : D
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Cypresswolf: Same here.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Pokemon MMORPG. ALL MY MONEY.
<Cypresswolf> arent there about 700 now?
<Ponies47> Well that is pretty interesting

<Cypresswolf> What's different with Black & White 2 from the 1st set?
<Panda|Drawing> Just making sure you are still on :3
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Cypresswolf: Time lapse, I think.
<sonicdude558> oh hi BaconMane
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Also, it continues from Black/White.
<Dken2021> Cypresswolf 649 to be exact
*DoctoDoctorWho approaches AJIsAwesome|Reading from behind sneakily
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> DoctoDoctorWho: !
<Phase4> http://www.valvesoftware.com/gamersurvey.php?action=survey << requires us zip code D:
<Cypresswolf> I'm betting the franchise will reach 1000 pokemon before running out of ideas
<Lunar_Brony> hi DoctoDoctorWho
*DoctoDoctorWho upon hearing a certian MGS sound effect, the doctor flee's
<Phase4> also: inb4 valves 'hardware' is linux based pc
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> where does say that ?
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, it doesnt, i entered my postcode and it complained
<Phase4> australia has 4 digit post codes
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> I wish you would get an ACTUAL award instead of a "diploma".
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Reading: But anyway, hi buddy:)
<Dken2021> Cypresswolf they've been running out of ideas since the first gen? Seel? Voltorb?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Hi, DoctoDoctorWho. :)
<thelonepony> hi DoctoDoctorWho
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh i entered mine but it's 5 digits
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> And people say that Gen 5 was unoriginal.
<Petrified_Discord> Pokemon creation: take an animal. take an object. Combine them.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> too bad if it only us based
<Cypresswolf> Pokemon Fushion
<Petrified_Discord> Squirt gun. Turtle. Squirtle.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Seriously though, I hate the war between Gen 5 and Gen 1. Makes me sick.
<DoctoDoctorWho> also, hello thelonepony Lunar_Brony and anypony else I missed:$
<Petrified_Discord> Zebra. Umbrella. Zebrella.
<Petrified_Discord> There's your gen 6 there.
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Reading: G3 is best gen
<Dken2021> Petrified_Discord XD
<Petrified_Discord> DoctoDoctorWho: ^
<Cypresswolf> those "legendary" pokemon - how much more powerful can they get - once you reach gods & creation status, there's little if anything above that
<DoctoDoctorWho> For pokemon, not ponies. Definitly not ponies, 0_0
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Cypresswolf: I was wondering that.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 stream working for everyone?
<Lunar_Brony|TF2> ValtheJean is now
<DoctoDoctorWho> ValtheJean: there was stream?
<Petrified_Discord> My favorite moment in pokemon is when you reach the gen 3 elite four and you get a different intro and the special, kinda scary music. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC6TnjsmTjw
<Cypresswolf> still have buffer wheel
<Lunar_Brony|TF2> oh STEAM

<ValtheJean> 2,14 let us all take a moment to honor Nobuo Uematsu, as this was his last official work on a final fantasy game
<Cypresswolf> all those hours of game play WASTED :'(
<ValtheJean> 2,14 his music is a significant reason why these games are amazing
<himself> sadmusic.avi
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: f***ing hate ff, Im sorry I just do...
<himself> but yeah, uematsu was boss
*Dken2021 salutes to one of his favorite musicians of all time

<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: Don't you dare say the music is bad!!!!! :[
<Dken2021> whatevs
<Spectrum_Rush> so ValtheJean is this just the regular version of FFX or the international version?
<Panda|Drawing> ValtheJean, FFX? god dammit! You are further making me wanna draw Lulu D:
<himself> dat animation
<ValtheJean> 2,14 probably the regular version, it's my roommate's copy since the one I own is scratched and crashes every time at the dance =/
<Kandarihu> Kinda an upbeat mix of Prelude
<himself> ive only played one ff, but that half-squat arm stretch animation was the same
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: well my sound isnt working and I've never played the game so Ill just have to take your word for it.

<Panda|Drawing> catch you later brownie state :3
<Dken2021> also, prelude <3
<taoumi> i really like how well they tied in auron in for kingdom harts 2
<Kandarihu> I have a 2.1 speaker system, and there's a plastic bag in front of my woofer. So I hear that bag every time there's bass
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 shit gets real
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> ^
<Dken2021> oh look, it's daddy
<himself> the aids?
<taoumi> how do they hold their breath for so long?
<Kandarihu> There goes the bag again
<Bronysith> taoumi: special water
<Bronysith> Final Boss Music
<taoumi> i call shinanigans
<Kandarihu> It's kind of a surprise hearing Nobuo Uemetsu doing metal
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there's been debate whether or not they hold their breath, or can actually breath underwater
<Bronysith> taoumi: its actually possible, the water has enough oxygen that you can breathe it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but honestly, it's a game, who gives a fuck
<Bronysith> ValtheJean: i like the idea of an intense amount of oxygen in the water
<taoumi> yeah except water shreads the ravioli in your lungs Brad[Laptop]
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: yeah, but it's too little to process it out of the water
<Spectrum_Rush> thats not ominous
<taoumi> opps sorry Brad[Laptop]
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: that's why they invented breathing fluid
<Spectrum_Rush> Auron gives no fucks
<Spitfire> whaty game is this? o 3o
<Dark_Horst> i dont know who did it, but they mangaed to create a fluid that is actually breathable. tested it on rats, it worked
<taoumi> ff10
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> FF X
<Dken2021> Oh snap
<taoumi> ff10 in b4 it got poopy in ff13
<Brad[Laptop]> taoumi lol
<Kandarihu> Who performed that metal btw?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: as cool as it sounds, the usefulness of this product would be?
<taoumi> hallo bah- opps spoilers
<Kandarihu> My plastic bag is going crazy
<CriticKitten> Mfw I turn on the stream and suddenly MEG RYAN
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm watching you Taoumi -_-
<himself> taoumi: :|
<taoumi> :3
<Ralin> DoctoDoctorWho: deep water diving.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> :D
<CriticKitten> AURON
<CriticKitten> Best pony, rite thar
<Dark_Horst> doctor_whooves127: diving. breathing a fluid instead of a gas would come in handy at high pressure depths
<himself> taoumi: you Did spoil that for me.
<Ralin> It would help people survive the pressure.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ralin: like, making more use of space in a compressed tank?
<taoumi> omg a giant bal lof water
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, the stuff seen in The Abyss?
<doctor_whooves127> ??
<Dark_Horst> naw, that was gas
<taoumi> it'
<taoumi> s zubat
<CriticKitten> I'll HAAAAAAARM YOU
<Ralin> DoctoDoctorWho: No, it would support your lungs, so you wouldn't be crushed.
<Dken2021> our hero ladies and gentlemen
<Kandarihu> But that WAS liquid.
<Amu-chan> Hi!
<Dark_Horst> i might have to rewatch that movie
<Kimori> hi
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ralin: thats your lungs covered, what about the rest of your body?
<Dark_Horst> oh wait, i was thinking of sphere
<Dark_Horst> never saw the abyss
<Amu-chan> How are you?
<DoctoDoctorWho> a skull can easily collapse in 1000+ feet of water
<VenHur> I thought his name was Titus or something....aw well...
<Cades> I'm good, you?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I changed it to Dari
<Kandarihu> It was a pink liquid, tested on someone's pet mouse, actually used on the protagonist for the dive at the end
<CriticKitten> Tidus.
<CriticKitten> Also known as Meg Ryan.
<Dken2021> Dari is fitting because....well... dari
<Amu-chan> I'm good. Had fun chatting with a friend earlier. XD
<Ralin> I don't know the specifics, but it would supposedly help.
<Cades> oh that's good
<taoumi> an anenomi
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ralin: I suppose
<Kandarihu> Ah yes. This music is truely the Uematsu touch
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 dari makes an appearance
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> No kill like overkill.
*DoctoDoctorWho is getting C&C 3 in a few weeks
*DoctoDoctorWho is excited beyond words
<Dken2021> neat DoctoDoctorWho
<taoumi> it's a fun game DoctoDoctorWho. play as gdi first, the nod campain is harsh
<DoctoDoctorWho> taoumi: does scrin have a campaign?
<Spectrum_Rush> huh that look like gravity
<CriticKitten> So basically they're fighting Cthulhu's minions
<taoumi> yeas DoctoDoctorWho but you have to finish bolth the gdi and nod campains to get to it
<Cades> http://soundcloud.com/sadhudubstep/gangnam-style-sadhu-remix
<Dken2021> it is, gravity is called demi sometimes
<DoctoDoctorWho> taoumi: I will fight to hell and back for that, f***ing love the scrin.
<Dovah> ded chat?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Nope.
<DoctoDoctorWho> GDI is good to tho,
<taoumi> the nod campain is a pain though :/
<Dken2021> somewhat
<taoumi> hai lyra
<sonicdude558> Hi guys I am back :) what did I miss?
<taoumi> ff10 intro
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Nothing much.
<sonicdude558> Reminds me of KH1
<DoctoDoctorWho> It always seems that the tech savvy side in a campaign is always harder. Less firepower to bring to the front I suppose.
<sonicdude558> btw I never played KH1
<taoumi> well for nod their units are jsut so much less durable
<DoctoDoctorWho> ZERG WRATH!
<Kandarihu> Really rocking my plastic bag
<StinkomanFan> TF2 Updated
<StinkomanFan> New MVM junk
<taoumi> plastic bag Kandarihu ?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> ValtheJean: Has it ever been tested that you can kill all the enemies without hitting the object?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Quantity has a quality all its own
<taoumi> ooo noooo waters
<Bronysith> this music has so much nostalgia
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Or do you need to do it?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they respawn infinitely
<Kandarihu> The bag in front of my 2.1 system's woofer
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> AH.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Okay.
<taoumi> it's ... a glowinghole
<Vivix> I always thought that young guy looked like Nick or.. Aaron Carter, that backstreets boys dude's brother
<CriticKitten> THIS IS YOUR STORY
<Vivix> Granted, I haven't seen a picture of either for over 10 years
<taoumi> spageti
*Vivix guesstimates
<sonicdude558> I am acting!
<sonicdude558> :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Aaron Carter, were have I heard that name b4?
<sonicdude558> Listen
<sonicdude558> oh hi Lyra
<Dken2021> swimming...in the air
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Some pop singer in the 90s i think.
*BaconMane defenestrates Valthejean
<sonicdude558> I am still acting
<CriticKitten> You think>
<CriticKitten> *?
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho, had some hit in 2001, kid artist
<DoctoDoctorWho> k
<ValtheJean> 2,14 was there a reasoning behind that LC?
<CriticKitten> Dis monologue
<sonicdude558> Who is streaming
<Dken2021> Val is
*sonicdude558 burps
<Vivix> Anyway, any JS wiz's here? I'm stuck again
<Vivix> Javascript that is
<sonicdude558> tha fuq?
<sonicdude558> nvm
<BaconMane> 0,5Huh?
<taoumi> al bhed
<BaconMane> 0,5No, just goofing around.
<BaconMane> 0,5:3
<Dken2021> Dari can't read, not a big surprise
<taoumi> xD
<sonicdude558> And Lyra sits on the rock.
<sonicdude558> And then gets eaten by a shark. The end.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hmmm...dare I?
<sonicdude558> o so ps2 eh?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nah, it's more fun when you can't understand them
<sonicdude558> pretty good graphics for a ps2
<Kandarihu> I remember when AGTP released their translation patch for Tactics Ogre. It came out on April 1st and was also in Al Bhed. The English patch came out a week later.
<sonicdude558> And the chat slows down...
<sonicdude558> SEA PONIES
<taoumi> we're watching the riviting falling
<taoumi> and swiming
<Dken2021> he seems to like falling alot
<Amu-chan> What exactly is that? (Didn't click)
<taoumi> and swiming
<sonicdude558> Is the music a mod or in the actual game?
<Dken2021> random battle!
<taoumi> actual game
<sonicdude558> wow
<Kandarihu> sonicdude558, how could the music be modded?
<taoumi> it's been done
<sonicdude558> knew it
<sonicdude558> :)
<CriticKitten> OH GOD IT'S A DEEP ONE
<Dken2021> random boss!
<taoumi> but no ff is ualy very good w/ it's music
<CriticKitten> Roll 1d100 for sanity loss!
<sonicdude558> Rule idk: If there is a game, there is a mod of it. No Exceptions.
<taoumi> again ff13 continues to disapoint
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Underwater combat~
<sonicdude558> dat midi
<CriticKitten> (and 90% of the chat just went "wat")
<Kandarihu> taoumi, this is FFX
<Bronysith> this game is 11 years old this year
<taoumi> i knoe i'm sayign that ff13 continues to disapoint
<Kandarihu> taoumi, ah, I see.
<Bronysith> taoumi: final fantasy 13 will never end
<sonicdude558> Whoa! Thats a big one! - Sonic
<Bronysith> 1st one sucked
<Bronysith> 2nd one
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, not unless you finish it
<taoumi> i have played al lthe ff for 7 onward exp 11 and 14
<Cades> a gangnam style dubstep remix :p
<taoumi> and 13 was afull jsutr afull
<sonicdude558> Oh hi Bronysith, why aren't u dead?
<Bronysith> taoumi: i enjoy Final fantasy 6 and 7 the most, and 10 is just pure nostalgia
<CriticKitten> A shame he didn't
<Bronysith> sonicdude558: nope
<Dken2021> was XIII really that bad?
<taoumi> 10-2 was not as bad as it was rated
<Kandarihu> The only Final Fantasy I ever beat was 6, although I have Crystal Chronicles
<Bronysith> Dken2021: yes
<taoumi> YES Dken2021
*sonicdude558 throws Bronysith into a moon cannon, lights it and runs away
*Bronysith crawls up into sonicdude558 s plothole
<RoboGerbil> sonicdude558: do you like bananas?
<taoumi> then cast fire tidus... srsly
<sonicdude558>
<Vivix> Sometimes the stories in FF games look fun, but the gameplay doesn't call out to me-
<Dken2021> I don't think Tidus is a black mage
<Bronysith> to me 7 and 6 are the most enjoyable, but 10 has the best story to me
<taoumi> ff is a good game to kind of vegout to
<Bronysith> thats probably from nostalgia though
<sonicdude558> eww I hate bananas
<taoumi> i love bananas
*sonicdude558 runs as fast as the speed of sound
*Bronysith puts a banana in sonicdude558 s throat
<Vivix> vegout?
<himself> sonicdude558: well thats good, cuz you and findin any, ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Spectrum_Rush> mindlessly play
<taoumi> like not heavyily invest in
<Vivix> ah
<himself> *aint
<taoumi> it's no cod is what i mean
<Amu-chan> Dubstep isn't really my thing... Neither is Gangnam Style.
<taoumi> not very stressfull
<sonicdude558> god himself, you have the best username
<Vivix> True
<me> Like what you see?
<himself> sonicdude558: god himself?
<taoumi> except 13 fk 13
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mfw children say FF is a game to vegout to...*sigh*...no one remembers the classics
<Cades> yeah haha, I just though it was kinda funny
<Dken2021> oh yea, I rmember God
<Bronysith> taoumi: you play final fantasy 6 yet?
<Vivix> What turned me away from games like that was my tendency to prefer Baldurs Gate / fallout and such rpg games when I was a kid
<himself> dari is hungry
<taoumi> no i haven't only 7 onward
<me> wow I am going to get alot of pings
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> No you're not. :P
<me> say game
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> No.
<me> yes
<Bronysith> taoumi: when you get the chance, play final fantasy 6, it is fantastic
<me> :trollface:
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> NOPE.AVI
<himself> you cried.
<himself> dari cried lul
<taoumi> i'v been folowing a lets play so i get the story
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it saddens me when people dont remember how FF used to be challenging
<RoboGerbil> Titus doesnt need food
<himself> titus
<Dken2021> V is also a good one, also the one that is the less serious out of all of them
<Vivix> It was challenging, as far as I remember, but I didn't like the combat system
<taoumi> i played 7 and 8
<Spectrum_Rush> ValtheJean: most challenging FF in your opinnion
<Bronysith> taoumi: im in the middle of 8 right now
<taoumi> the mai nsotry was not the worst but those optional bosses
<sonicdude558> ok, funs over
<taoumi> dem optional bosses
<sonicdude558> I was just kidding
<CriticKitten> All games used to be challenging, Val
<Cranberry_Scotch> Final Fantasy wasnamed because Square believed the game would be their last before closing down
<Kandarihu> One of these days, I'd like to do the FF6 mod called "Final Fantasy 6 is the Best Game Ever" which rebalances everything to make every battle hard.
<CriticKitten> Before the dark times. Before the Empire
<Dken2021> Before Enix?
<Bronysith> Cranberry_Scotch: everyone and their mothers know this story, except for new gamers hehe
<Bronysith> DAMN YOU SQUARE ENIX
<ValtheJean> 2,14 FF6 WAS hard when you didn't know how to abuse every boss fight
<sonicdude558> himself is best username
<Vivix> I don't know that story because I barely follow company history
<taoumi> :D you're suposed ot suplex the train
<RoboGerbil> Rikus bondage
<Bronysith> TARA STRONG LADIES AND GENTLEMENT
<Ryunosuke> have we past the key-mon part yet?
<sonicdude558> Tara?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<CriticKitten> Oh look, fanservice girl
<Bronysith> sonicdude558: rikku is voiced by tara
<sonicdude558> SHES MINE ALL MINE :[
<Kandarihu> You're supposed to use a Phoenix Down on Wrexsoul
<Ryunosuke> rikku is
<Cranberry_Scotch> Did you know that Super Smash Brothers for the N64 had a very small budget?
<Dken2021> the first one on the NES was hard because it wasn't playtested right and filled with bugs
<taoumi> i prefer the 10-2 costume :3
<Mega_Milk> leather crotch strap = armor
<himself> sonicdude558: eh ill switch back soon, but yeah, ive used this nickname since i played counter strike, so everyobody in kill log killed themself
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Cranberry_Scotch: It did?
<Kandarihu> I never tried Suplexing the Phantom Train. Is that instakill?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> How?
<Cranberry_Scotch> Yes
<taoumi> no i't jsut funny
<sonicdude558> lmao himself
<Dken2021> Kandarihu nah, jsut takes damage
<Mega_Milk> plot shot
<taoumi> but it's really funny
<Kandarihu> Fine. So the hillarity just makes it more amusing.
<Cranberry_Scotch> I don't know the exact reason, though.
<Dken2021> she's underage fro chriast sake!
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Okay.
<Ryunosuke> Kandarihu, the fact that sabin can suplex a train in the first place :)
<sonicdude558> Hello Spy
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, I see
<sonicdude558> from TF2
<taoumi> oh and the kamehameha isn't silly enough
<sonicdude558> Owch
<taoumi> gota get that new game + to understand what the hell they are saying
<Ryunosuke> jeeze that Dari is such a whiner :)
<Vivix> Reused audio
<CriticKitten> I understand him, idiot.
<Bronysith> Tara Strong Ladies and gentlemen
<Dken2021> eeyup
<sonicdude558> <3
<taoumi> brother :3
<Dark_Horst> she'S EVERYWHERE
<Amu-chan> I've been thinking of dyeing my hair a lighter color... XD
*sonicdude558 's body turns into air.
<Dken2021> even in your games
<sonicdude558> Tara is good
<Spectrum_Rush> she voices everything... including you
<Dken2021> :o
<taoumi> x.(\ tutorial time
<sonicdude558> oh u Spectrum_Rush
<RoboGerbil> silly tutotrials.. who reads that crap anyway
<CriticKitten> Also I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to hate on Rikku because Tara and all, but....I *hate* Rikku. ._.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Her VA shouldn't change how you feel about a character
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> ^
<CriticKitten> Your waifu is 15.
<CriticKitten> Pedo.
<Dken2021> Val, she's underaged
<CriticKitten> :D
<taoumi> sphear grid... way better then the 13 crystal... spirel whatever
*Vivix thought she was 14
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I was underage when the game came out
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so fuck off
<taoumi> same
<Panda|AFK> O-o
<RoboGerbil> rikku is pretty annoying...
<Panda|AFK> Val Rage?
<sonicdude558> Tara is 14? My god
<CriticKitten> Aw I'm just teasing. :p
<RoboGerbil> Rinoa is best ff girl
<Amu-chan> This afternoon I was looking up techniques to achieve that without bleaching.
<sonicdude558> j/k
<Kandarihu> Well, she played a 14 year old girl
<Cades> oh cool
<Panda|AFK> RoboGerbil, thats a wierd way to spell Lulu
<CriticKitten> My hate for Tidus is at least equal to Rikku, anyways.
<Vivix> The only char I remember is Rikku, because ps2 bought some ff game cause everyone said it was great
<Bronysith> RoboGerbil: FALSE, Terra is best FF girl
<Dken2021> RoboGerbil that's a funny way of spelling Rydia
<Vivix> don't remember anything from F8..or wahtever I borrowed
<sonicdude558> Hi Twilight Sparkle :)
<taoumi> i thought cloud was the best ff girl
<taoumi> :3
<Bronysith> taoumi: heyo..
<CriticKitten> This game has a distinct lack of Auron. Needs moar.
<taoumi> :D
<Kandarihu> Uh, that chest plate on Rikku looks suspiciously similarly colored to skin.
<CriticKitten> Intentional.
<sonicdude558> Rinoa = Twilight Sparkle
<Vivix> Intentional as hell
<CriticKitten> Rikku's primary purpose is underaged fanservice.
<CriticKitten> No, really.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> :S
<Vivix> I think so
<sonicdude558> brb one sec
<Dken2021> random battle!
<Vivix> Though her design says 18+ she is underage-
<Panda|AFK> CriticKitten, and I have no issues with that.
<CriticKitten> I seem to recall the original manual for the game showing her concept art as topless, which sorta gives away her purpose.
<Kandarihu> Well, I think dressing in a way to appear nearly topless is going a bit too far with fanservice.
<Vivix> If nudity doesn't add to the game, I'm usually oppose of it, of either gender
<Vivix> but--whatever, you know?
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Dude, you have no idea.
<CriticKitten> Wait until you see her default outfit.
<RoboGerbil> just beat on the terminal till it opens
<CriticKitten> Or, heck, her FFX-2 one
<Vivix> oh that..yellow ribbon thing?
<Dken2021> banging on a keyboard, a genius he is
<CriticKitten> That one's even worse. XD
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Wait, she has another costume? :S
<Bronysith> Tomorrow is the 2 Year aniversary of BRONIES
<CriticKitten> Yep.
<Dken2021> eeeyup
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, I just think that fanservice is okay in moderation, but I'd prefer to see it taken in a completely different extreme than the way it's always done.
<Vivix> of the s1 premiere?
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Oh, my.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Vivix: Yep.
<CriticKitten> http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=10772382 <---- That one.
<Vivix> Nice
<Amu-chan> Apparently, applying a 50/50 blend of lemon juice and water to hair and spending some time out in the sun can gradually lighten dark hair if done regularly.
*sonicdude558 clears mind
<sonicdude558> So what game is this guise?
<CriticKitten> FFX.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> CriticKitten: :S
<Vivix> eah that one was in teh game I had
<CriticKitten> Probably one of the best of the new generation.
<Vivix> in that game.. dunno which, I didn't get the story or point- so never got far
<Cades> That would be a pain in the ass
<CriticKitten> But mostly because of its mechanics.
<Kandarihu> And there's no room for bare breasts in my vision of extreme fanservice.
<Vivix> Really? I didn't like it much-
<CriticKitten> Story is pretty lackluster and some of the characters are just awful.
<Vivix> aah hehe
<RoboGerbil> hmm i bet i could get a ps2 emulator and play my ps2 games on my pc
<CriticKitten> Buuuuuut I adore the combat and the sphere grid is pretty nice
<Vivix> It was the first FF game I played, after that I borrowed either FF7 or 8
<Amu-chan> Would be a better than the more damaging, quicker technique of bleaching in my opinion.
<Kandarihu> Dat percussive maintenance
*Vivix was not a console kid
<Dken2021> RoboGerbil how strong is your PC?
<CriticKitten> So I'm usually pretty gentle on this game. Usually when I mock it, it's just for funsies.
<RoboGerbil> Dken2021: itspretty good
<Cades> yeah true
<CriticKitten> TENTACOOL!
<CriticKitten> Quick, capture it!
<Kandarihu> To be honest, I grew up on consoles. I was 17 when I got my first PC
<Bronysith> Tentacool x Misty
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Why did it have a grenade in the first place? :D
<Vivix> I used my first computer when I was 3
<Kandarihu> Or maybe I was 16. I'm not sure
<Lyra`> what was hawk girls story again?
<Dken2021> eww, tentacools, the zubat of the sea
<Lyra`> her backstory?
<Vivix> We always had computers
<CriticKitten> Wait. Underaged girl? Tentacle monster? OH JAPAN.
<Vivix> <,<
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349780099451.jpg
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, combat tentacles
<RoboGerbil> Dken2021: thats a funny way of spelling magikarp
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: misty is 18
<Vivix> I got my firs consol when I was..16 I think
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Bronysith: :S
<Vivix> or well..no that's not right
<Dken2021> RoboGerbil magikarp don't poison you
<Lyra`> hawk girl <3
<Lyra`> I WUB HAWK GIRL!
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: Rikku isn't. She's fighting a tentacle monster. :P
<Lyra`> She is my lesbian waifu <3
<RoboGerbil> tentacle monster on a 14 yo? wait what?
<CriticKitten> z0mg, strategery!
<CriticKitten> Quick, throw a grenade at it!
<Kandarihu> You know the real irony? The only reason I was even ALLOWED to have an NES is because of Wisdom Tree, whom Nintendo didn't like.
<Lyra`> RoboGerbil, did you read my mind? but misplace the word lyra with 14 yo?
<CriticKitten> ....yes, underwater! What could go wrong?
<sub06905> seems that my dog is terrified of my sonic screwdriver :D
<CriticKitten> :D
<CriticKitten> Yay~
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> sub06905: :D
<CriticKitten> Grenade is best generic item/weapon.
<himself> sub06905: it must be a door dog
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Underwear?
<Dken2021> Kandarihu oh that must've sucked having that
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a satin maid corset
<RoboGerbil> Lyra`: im thinking lyra would be the one wining
<sub06905> suddenly Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dammit.
<Lyra`> and youre damn right RoboGerbil.
<Lyra`> damn right.
<derpy_face> final fantasy 10?
<derpy_face> ...
<Kandarihu> Dken2021, I didn't mind it that much. Sure the game was repetitive and AMAZINGLY buggy. But I still played it.
<derpy_face> Well buh bye i dont liek final fantasy after they screwed up 13
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> bye, derpy_face.
<CriticKitten> ded bos
<CriticKitten> *baws
<Kandarihu> I also got every game Wisdom Tree ever made for the NES. I beat all of them except for Exodus and Joshua

<CriticKitten> Damnit
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, probably
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Cypresswolf: I think so. Either that or the Saber/Paleo one.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Can't wait for them to come out.
<Cypresswolf> Wondered what became of that - Looking forward to it either way
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Too bad I couldn't get the DVD version.

<sonicdude558> This is all fake :3
<CriticKitten> GODZILLA
*Kandarihu tries to kick sub06905 but isn't an OP
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, sonicdude558. :)
<CriticKitten> Oh, it's just Sin.
<sonicdude558> I made a big spoiler!
<Cypresswolf> Spoiler Alert! Neigh-ther can I :P
<Lyra`> oh Cypresswolf <3
<CriticKitten> He ded

<sonicdude558> He lives
<CriticKitten> He's floating in water UPSIDE DOWN.
<sonicdude558> told u
<CriticKitten> HE CAN"T BREATHE LIKE THAT. :|
<Cypresswolf> 1000 years later
<himself> they just spent the entire game breathing in water
<CriticKitten> Oh god, this guy.
<CriticKitten> XD
<himself> so apparently, they Can breath in water.
<Spectrum_Rush> was that Billy West?
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, I'm thinking that too. Perhaps the Al-Bhed were extinct for a thousand years.
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, doesn't he sound like Bender/
<AJIsAwesome> *?
<sub06905> what a kick\
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he IS bender
<Cypresswolf> Goooooaaaaaal!
<AJIsAwesome> ah.
<CriticKitten> himself: That's never explained, ever....one of the things that bugs me about this game. >_>
<sonicdude558> brb I am gonna transfer to lappy
<CriticKitten> Apparently water is easy to breathe in.
<himself> CriticKitten: well, its at least obvious that floating facedown wont kill him
<superretroworld> fry: i hate this world, i have no life, no job... bender: and no friends xD
<Cypresswolf> now to draw straws to see who has to find the ball this time :P
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony

<Bronysith> ValtheJean: be sure to avoid dat lightning
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Bronysith. :)
<LadyCanary> ....Do my eyes decieve me?!
<Cypresswolf> G'Night Bronysith
<Dken2021> night Bronysith
<Kandarihu> Well, videogame characters breathing underwater is at least more commonly addressed than spacecraft having gravity.
<CriticKitten> himself: Only if you ignore the properties of water,
<thelonepony> night Bronysith
<CriticKitten> ....wait
<sub06905> bai Bronysith
<LadyCanary> ....TIIIIDUUUUUUUUUS. *shakes fist*

*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a pillow
<Panda|AFK> ?
<Kandarihu> brudda
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least it's not a maid corset.
<LadyCanary> Bro, broceidon
<LadyCanary> God of the broceans
*Bronysith beats said pillow
<CriticKitten> himself: Sci-fi allows me to believe that you have warp speed travel and phasers that knock people out. It does not allow me to believe that water works differently because of reasons. :p
<Dken2021> but I thought you love those <3
<Lyra`> why cant it be a maids corset?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 here's a thought critickitten
*Bronysith puts Lyra` in a maid corset
<ValtheJean> 2,14 rather than focus on the water
<LadyCanary> Hiya Val :3
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in a latex maid corset and leaves
*Lyra` looks so purty <3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why not believe the people who can cast MAGIC also can breathe underwater
<himself> ^^^
<CriticKitten> How?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith is going to be the new channel maid soon.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because they aren't human
<ValtheJean> 2,14 different species, different rules
<sonicdude558> Hi again guise
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so stop bitching about such a stupid ass thing
*superretroworld protects Bronysith
<Lyra`> dat!
<CriticKitten> They never cast spells in the water. And old Zanardkand was a high-tech place, wasn't it? :P
*sonicdude558 falls asleep
<Lyra`> can i be non-human
<Lyra`> ive always wanted to be a sea pony :3
<CriticKitten> Er, rather, they never cast a spell to breathe underwater before going in water.
<sonicdude558> Hey Bronysith
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you are missing the poin
<ValtheJean> 2,14 t
<CriticKitten> So what, is it always active? How does that sorta thing work?
<himself> CriticKitten: oh for the love of cheese, give it a rest. if youre going to whine about these things, dont watch games with MAGIC, ALIEN RACES, scifi
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they are BIOLOGICALLY different
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so shut.thefuck.up

<CriticKitten> You're getting way too stressed out. I'm asking how people who are clearly human are able to violate human physiology, and you're flipping out. It's just a question.
<sonicdude558> lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Did I come in at a bad time?
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: and you are arguring with a mod
<sonicdude558> ya
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you've been bitching about it since the beginning of the game
<himself> CriticKitten: uh, same way magic works?
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: you have no idea
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and I'm not in the mood to go through it every fucking time there's a water level
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Duly noted
*Bronysith pushes SaxyPretender out of chat into safety
<Kandarihu> You know what? I'm working on a science fiction series in which the ships are designed AROUND an artificial gravity system, and it's a simple one too: dark matter cores.
<CriticKitten> Well actually, I've been bitching about it since he fell into the water after the boat attack, so about five minutes ago. But seriously, chill out.
<LadyCanary> Just keep swimming~
*Spectrum_Rush come my little saxy , its not safe here for you
<ValtheJean> 2,14 bullshit
<CriticKitten> You're, like, WAY overreacting.
<LadyCanary> OH GOD FISH.
<Dken2021> alright, how about we say, they can breathe underwater, is that enough for you?
<MaidLyra`> fish are friends
<MaidLyra`> not food.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you've been saying it since blitzball, which is the beginning of the game
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so knock it off
<CriticKitten> I ....wasn't here for that sequence, so yeah, no.
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: yes you were
<CriticKitten> I came in AFTER Sin arrived, remember>

<Ryunosuke> how about this, stfu or gtfo. If you dont like what is streamed, no one is putting a gun to your head to make you watch :)
<sub06905> turn them fish into sushi
<CriticKitten> *?
<himself> CriticKitten: you just really like saying loud things. i mean seriously, its a game with magic in it, does water-breathing really seem so ridiculous
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Can it, please. It's just a game, and game logic doesn't follow real-life logic.
<LadyCanary> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Bronysith> and neither does cartoons
<himself> ^^^
<Bronysith> or anything fun
<CriticKitten> Okay seriously, what is the deal? I ask a question, the mod flips the fuck out, and suddenly everyone's asskissing him? Can you all just chill your jets? I asked a question, I'm not insulting your mother.

<QuinnThePegaSistta> hey AJIsAwesome
<thelonepony> hi QuinnThePegaSistta :)
<ZanarKandarihu> AJIsAwesome, by pony withdrawal, you are referring to the wait for S3, right?
<AJIsAwesome> Because of the lack of pony, I've been able to check out other things.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> Hi thelonepony
<AJIsAwesome> ZanarKandarihu: Yes. :)
<CriticKitten> I'm....cautiously optimistic about next season.

<ZanarKandarihu> AJIsAwesome, I see. I'm depriving myself of anything explicitly pony related. Desktop ponies or Wrek's new plush equivalent are exempt. But episodes, pmvs, music and Wrek drawing ponies are off limits to me.

<O> I was supposed to be O griofa biut it didnt register the space
<O> ill go change it
<Dken2021> you...er nvm
<Dken2021> anyway, you can't use spaces, gotta use underscores
<Dken2021> or hash, that works too
<CriticKitten> Fun fact: FF7 and FF10 are apparently in the same canon. I....admit I still don't know why or how. But they are.
<O-Griofa> Now?
<O-Griofa> Got it
<Dken2021> CriticKitten wha?
<Buytoast> is this that PETA pokemon game i've seen flaunted around?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She must be hot in that black dress.
<ZanarKandarihu> Buytoast, I guess I should check that out some time
<ValtheJean> 2,14 critickitten: in X-2, the child Shinra notices there's a way to extract energy from pyreflies

<therainbowvortex> hello every pony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, therainbowvortex. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi therainbowvortex.
<thelonepony> hi therainbowvortex :)
<CriticKitten> Dken2021: Yes, seriously
<Dken2021> hai therainbowvortex
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's an indirect suggestion, but it leads to the possibility of 10 being a prequel to 7
<O-Griofa> Whick host is streaming?
<CriticKitten> The devs actually said the two are in the same canon. Go figure.
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: It's that the kid from FFX and FF X-2 is the ancestor of the Shinra corp-- and later they went to different planets and eventually create Materia Generators.
<Lyra`> :o
<AJIsAwesome> Val is.
<Dken2021> O-Griofa that would be the guy with the grey-navy texyt
<CriticKitten> I think it was a marketing ploy, though, to link the two most popular franchises.
<Lyra`> two shots in the same CANON!
<Buytoast> praying is for chumps
<Lyra`> but, theyle only go half as far :3
<ZanarKandarihu> Buytoast, praying is for champs
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: X-2 ya mean? I don't think the kid shows in X.
<Buytoast> you spelled chumps wrong there son
<AJIsAwesome> You spelled champs wrong there.
<Kencolt> CriticKitten: Hmm... I think he has a small cameo, but you may be right.
<Buytoast> oh shit donkey kong looks piiiiised
<Dken2021> oh look, it's thew most underrated character in the game
<ZanarKandarihu> Dken2021, the Boba Fett of FFX?
<AJIsAwesome> So how was this game received in terms of ratings?
<Dken2021> blue mages get no respect ;_;
<CriticKitten> Underrated? Hm....I'm guessing it's Blue Chewie?
<AJIsAwesome> Chat is silent?
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony! Is my chat derping?
<AJIsAwesome> hi, DerpyMuffins. Nope. :)
<DerpyMuffins> So quiet
<thelonepony> hi DerpyMuffins :)
<AJIsAwesome> I know. :d
<CriticKitten> I think they're shocked I called him Blue Chewie. I must be racist against Ronso.
<CCCP> hi DerpyMuffins
<Dken2021> hai DerpyMuffins, nah, it's kinda slow today
<QuinnThePegaSistta> hey DerpyMuffins !
<RoboGerbil> yunas VA isnt very good
<O-Griofa> What is this game? xD
<CCCP> hi QuinnThePegaSistta
<AJIsAwesome> FFX
<DerpyMuffins> Caramel streaming?
<thelonepony> yup
<AJIsAwesome> Yep. :)
<QuinnThePegaSistta> hi CCCP
<Dken2021> a Zu?
<DerpyMuffins> Why does this look like a Final Fantisy game?
<CriticKitten> Because it is.
<Kencolt> DerpyMuffins: Because it IS.
<Dken2021> because it is?
<DerpyMuffins> Never really was into FF that much
<CriticKitten> Understandable.
<CriticKitten> It's more of an acquired taste, I think.
<ZanarKandarihu> yaaaaaay
<RoboGerbil> CriticKitten: yeh most JRPG's are an aquired taste
<CCCCP> derpity fuck fuck fuck!
<CriticKitten> Sort of like how people tell me beer is an acquired taste but it still tastes like pisswater to me. :P
<CCCCP> Damnit
<ZanarKandarihu> That's a Laser-powered Yay
<Dken2021> and fluttershy kills
<ZanarKandarihu> Er, a laser-focused yay
<CCCP> :o
<RoboGerbil> CriticKitten: everyone has their own taste in beer, gotta try a bunch of different brands before you find your favorite
<DerpyMuffins> They dont have max repels in FF?
<CriticKitten> Oh, whoops. I haven't cleared Hoelbrak yet. :/
<Kencolt> You know, I played this game a dozen times back in the day-- and never noticed that that summons has boobs.
<RoboGerbil> Kencolt: they take on aspects of their summoner
<CriticKitten> The dragon thingie?
<Dken2021> DerpyMuffins eenope
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it's....weird.
<O-Griofa> This game is pretty badass
<CCCP> I hate computers :(
<DerpyMuffins> Well I prefer Vodka over wine, and Im part french
<CriticKitten> Kinda wish they retained the combat.
<CriticKitten> It's probably some of the best combat in the FF series.
<Kencolt> One of the best things about this game was the ability to switch your characters in midbattle so as to have whatever talent you needed at the right moment.
<RoboGerbil> i liked the non-class character system
<CriticKitten> Yeah, it all felt very dynamic and alive
<CCCP> Wine has a very high chance of having big legs in it...

<ZanarKandarihu> Well, I was kind of hoping it was gonna come to some sort of stopping point to be honest. I was worried that this was going to go on for a few hours and I'd fall behind on showing my mom another episode of Macross 7.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14red pill
<AJIsAwesome> What is it, Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13i want to stream bayformers rifftrax
<O-Griofa> To whomever posted the Animatic comic thanks, i really liked it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I agree red pill
<Shizuka> 13but we try not to stream movies outside movie night in case they're picked
<DerpyMuffins> Bayformers?
<thelonepony> oh, okais
<Wirisme> red pill = pinkie pie powers
<Wirisme> so yes
<Shizuka> 13will anyone be horribly heartbroken if i stream bayformers rifftrax
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Do it shizu
<Dovah> AJIsAwesome: that is logical, I say this! http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lv4hn09dSZ1qbcq69.jpg
<Wirisme> Depends what that is
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<Shammy> Shizuka: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STREAM IT
<DerpyMuffins> Wtf is bayformers?
<thelonepony> your choice
<Shizuka> 13that is transformers as spewed out by michael bay
<Dken2021> I'm sure we can live with it shizu
<Erdrick> Go for it.
<AJIsAwesome> I won't.
<AJIsAwesome> Go for it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would say that's a mod talk more than anything
<DerpyMuffins> Who would pick it?
<O-Griofa> Do it Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13ooooor
<DerpyMuffins> In for a penny, in for a pound
<Shizuka> 13since i never see it voted
<Shizuka> 13what about spiderman rifftrax
<AJIsAwesome> SPiderman?
<DerpyMuffins> Which?
<AJIsAwesome> There's a rifftrax of that?
<O-Griofa> Spoderman?
<Shizuka> 13the tobey maguire ones, not the new crap ones
<CrimsonPhoenix> again, more like a modtalk than anything
<Kimori> You wanted it to be more black?
<Erdrick> Do both.
<Shizuka> 13i am asking you ponies :)
<AJIsAwesome> That'll be interesting. Go for Spiderman. :)
<Shizuka> 13carpe carpe! seize the fish!
<Shammy> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> well I gave my opinion
<O-Griofa> Iv ealready seen spidermans, i havent seen babyformers
<Ponies47> Shizuka: I could go for some Rifftrax :3
<thelonepony> Bayformers or Spiderman... spiderman
<Shizuka> 13explosions and clutter or explosions clutter and webs
<O-Griofa> Bayformers.
<AJIsAwesome> The latter.

<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Does randomly showing the Rifftrax disqualify it from being voted for?
<Amu-chan> I'm thinking of making it lighter, not darker. XP

<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: Yes. I need to switch to Xchat or something
<[Alpha-Trinity]> weird...how I started drawing on an ipad but from there I changed to pencil and find that more enjoyable.
<DashWithRainbows> I use mIRC, not sure what others use but I like it a lot.
<emangamer> Shizuka: so true http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/star_ratings.png
<Kammerjunk> mIRC is good.
<Silver_Soother> [Alpha-Trinity]: Drawing with pen and paper is soo much more enjoyable for me as well.
*ASoftFluffyThing uses HexChat because her mIRC expired and she doesn't have money to registe

<DashWithRainbows> Just... Wow.
<Shizuka> 13ASoftFluffyThing: you know you can use mirc forever right

<The_Awesomeness> this is where benidict watches my little pony
<Stallion_of_War> winzip isn't free! pay for it, or else we'll remind you that it's not free!
<Ponies47> DashWithRainbows: Pretty much yeah. If I did switch that would be the only thing I would miss
<superretroworld> i dont feel so good, i just saw a picture a fluttershys eyes taken out and was tortured, someone hold me
<Silver_Soother> Stallion_of_War: Will keep reminding you, for years. xD
<DashWithRainbows> I'm glad I switched.
*Silver_Soother holds superretroworld
<Silver_Soother> It's okay....
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I use pencil though. I don't like the dark shades of a pen. Plus I can control the shade of a pencil as well as texture by applying a certain amiunt of pressure
<DashWithRainbows> The emotes become annoying after about... an hour on an active chat.
<[Alpha-Trinity]> amount
<superretroworld> Silver_Soother: thanks, its scary from the anti bronys
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahahha
<Ponies47> I wanna get a second monitor for my desktop so I can have the chat on one and then I can do other things on the other
<[Alpha-Trinity]> It disturbs me at first ...but I adapt
<DashWithRainbows> Ponies47 Just for that sole purpose?
<DashWithRainbows> You need to think of more benefits.
<sub06905> i wanna get 3 monitors just to have the chat on three seprate things :D
<superretroworld> Ponies47: playing tf2 and chating on another, thats cool
<Shizuka> 13Ponies47: like me :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, I had mIRC on my admin account on my computer and I had it for 115 days. Then when I opened it one day, the splash screen had only the register and cancel buttons. It would close if I pressed cancel.
<Dr_Fumbles> Yay!!! I love Rifftrax! Oh, and hello Bronystate! :)
<Silver_Soother> superretroworld: They are a scary bunch... Here is a cute picture. http://ponysquare.com/photo/24926/rainbow_dash_and_fluttershy_by_zlack3r-d4etcw6/
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Indeed. Just like what you do :3
<Shizuka> 13ASoftFluffyThing: xchat
<Shizuka> 13or get an extra computer, install linux on it, and use the best combination ever
<Shizuka> 13irssi + screen + PuTTY
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, I have XChat and HexChat, though they're the same thing
<superretroworld> Silver_Soother: i feel better, thanks man
<emangamer> I think it's time for sleep -_-
<Ponies47> I think I'm gonna switch to Xchat soon or after I get a second monitor
<Silver_Soother> superretroworld: :)
<superretroworld> night emangamer
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Is is hard to hook up a second monitor?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, I'd install Linux on my other laptop when I finally get the money to get it a new hard drive.
<Shizuka> 13only if your card has the extra slot

<emangamer> Shizuka: I dont know if you can hook up one to vga and one to HDMI
<Shizuka> 13well, i'm hooked up to DVI and VGA on my card
<Silver_Soother> I think my next screen will be HDMI for gaming.
<emangamer> I'm using VGA because I dont have my HDMI on me
<superretroworld> night everypony
<[Alpha-Trinity]> yeah....I don't think I'll need more than one monitor :S
