<Bronysith> i cant believe how much i hate mainstream and casual gamers
<VikingCanary> Wrek spracken de english XD
<DJ_POn-3> :D
<DJ_POn-3> 6_9
*Vivix doesn't hate casuals
<CCCP> Bronysith why do you hate them? :(
<DJ_POn-3> :P
<CCCP> It makes you sound like a hipster
<Freefall29> Bronysith: not all mainstream is bad, tf2 is pretty mainstreamy and you love it.
<DJ_POn-3> :O
<Vivix> I had more trouble with the indie community-
<OohShiny> FUS RO DAH?
<Vivix> their techdemos given out as games is kinda --eh
<CCCP> In fact many mainstream games are good
<Wrek> 05no fus ro dah here
<Bronysith> Freefall29: not as mainstreamy as call of duty or skyrim or shit like that
<Wrek> 05only vikings
<OohShiny> aww
<Vivix> mainstream and casual helps us pay for gamedev and industry development
<VikingCanary> Yar ^_^
<Wrek> 05with his trusted axes bumtaze and candybar
<Vivix> CoD isn't bad either, it's just..onetrack
<DJ_POn-3> but in der toungue is ponikiin equinborn LOVE AND TOLERATE
<VikingCanary> <333333333
<VikingCanary> Best axes.
<CCCP> Bronysith don't generalize all mainstream games
<shibaru> 8)
<Freefall29> my only problem with mainstream is when they only care about quantity rather then quality. so they copy and paste shit that's been done before *cough* black ops 2 and put no effort to do something new
<Vivix> playing CoD is like playing hl1 mp
<prince-dari> Fun fact about my friend: He once went to talk to some people in a house that were threatening to call the police (party in a field), he ended up playing a song for them on a guitar, talking to them about music, after which point they told me "We were never really going to call the polcie anyway"
<Cynder7> 6Once my friend had given me her phone during class so I could look at the songs she had on it..I fail with touchscreen stuff though and instead of scrolling I put on a song by accident..I didn't know how to turn down the volume and to pause it I'd kinda have to risk it getting heard and getting in trouble..Meanwhile people had started "coughing" so as to save
<Vivix> that's true Freefall29, while I thought MW1 was fun, I have no idea if there's any difference between the 3 games in its namesake
<Freefall29> Vivix: are you talking about 1-3 or 4+?
<Vivix> but SP campaign might count as different-
<Cades> lol
<Vivix> Well I played the old cods, but CoD4 is like playing a onetrack oldschool MP game
<Bronysith> i cant believe how much gaming has gone downhill
<Vivix> no goal, just--fight
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Vivix> and that can be a ton of fun
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Just because it's mainstream doesn't mean it's bad.
<CCCP> Also there are many worse games than cod.. Really I know their overrated and generic but really their are 1,000 of worse non mainstream games
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> It just means that it's very popular in today's society.
<Vivix> I think game industry has gone uphill, but that's it's as slow as it used to be with good titles spread far between
<Freefall29> the only cod game I care about is world at war, just for nazi zomies. and yes. zombies sucked in black ops.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Although some things don't really deserve popularity........
<Vivix> CCCP, yes, totally
<Vivix> I do stick by, if it's popular, it's popular for a reason, so I usually don't rag on that
<CCCP> FreeFall29 it was good in black ops I think..
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP: Agreed.
*derpherp hitting Vivix
<JRPHONE> MakerDusk: hey can you make me some dusk?
*Vivix cries
<Vivix> Only Jmo can hit me ;__;
<derpherp> i`m a secret agent so i hit Vivix :D
<Cynder7> 6my ass and the teacher just said "Are you guys sick or something?" truth is she hadn't even heard the music..I was all hunched up,trying to muffle the sound from the phone..She was staring at me and I thought she was just giving me the chance to turn it of with out her saying anything..Instead she just asked me if I was ok..I managed to turn the thing off in
<Cynder7> 6the end.. x)
*Jmo licks Vivix
<Vivix> ;__;
<Cynder7> 6Suinide! :D
<Cynder7> 6*hugs8
*Vivix latches unto JMo
<Cynder7> 6**
<Cades> hey suinude!
<CCCP> JFK reloaded is bad game never play it, it's offensive
<Cades> u know him/her?
*derpherp hits Vivix because i`m a secret agent
*Freefall29 rips off secret agent badge off of derpherp. Now you're no longer a secret agent
<Cynder7> 6Yeah ^^
<Vivix> Just the name makes me not want to play it
<Suinide> Hiya *hugs*
<Vivix> I'm safe!
<Cades> awesome :p
<princess> bk n thats starting to look good Wrek ^-^
<Cynder7> 6The beginning of that sentence looks pretty weird.."my ass and the teacher just said.."? Fail xD
<CCCP> More brownies should read home stuck
<Vivix> But--gaming hasn't gone downhill in my opinion. Not only is tech developing, but storytelling is- we are lacking in the adventure and old school story heavy stuff, but those things are coming back slowly
<Cynder7> 6How've you been? :3
<derpherp> hacking your computer hacking your computer i`m a detectime so i`m hacking your computer
<Freefall29> CCCP: I didn't know brownies could read
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> How is Homestuck? Is it good?
<CCCP> FreeFall damn auto correct

<CCCP> Ly*
<Wrek> 05sketch more or less done
<Vivix> I've never read Homestuck, but I liked Moonstuck
*derpherp a new agent badge appears on me
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP: Not really a secret anymore, now is it? :D
<Vivix> Wrek looking good Wrek- seriously reminds me of the sketches from DnD Monster manual
<Buytoast> Homestuck is overrated garbage that people force down others' throats in order to feel like they have some superior knowledge and can act deep and edgy.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Vivix: What's Moonstuck about?
<Buytoast> In a nutshell.
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome|Homework, Woona stuck on the moon, goes for the cutesy style and such
*derpherp hits Vivix with a crowbar becuase i`m a detective

<Dov\> no stream?
<Bronysith> Freefall29: my point still stands
<Barbetos> Anyone play CSGO?
<Vivix> the pinacle of RPG depends on RPG type
<Dovah> ..
<Bronysith> CCCP: play chrono trigger first
<Randomnerd> 6 (3, in the states) is a big deal.
<Dovah> thats better
<Vivix> I am a fan of WRPG and- it didn't work for me
<Cades> hipster cat likes evil characters before they were cool
<Dovah> anyway there is no stream atm?
<Randomnerd> Lunar was a good series.
<Cynder7> 6Standing on tiptoe for five minutes yesterday sure gave me some exercise.. ._.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: basically a guy who is extremely famous on the internet for no good reasons
<Dken2021> huh, discussing RPGs eh?
<Randomnerd> Dovah: Fus ro -fraid not
<derpherp> i`m a secret agent and i`m sitting on Vivix :D
<Freefall29> for anybody who's wondering, yeah. no stream atm.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: he reviews viral videos and gets 5 million views each vid he puts out
<Vivix> Heey THat's Jmo's spot

<Ryunosuke> Rhino March by Ponies_r_Lame? Centepede Episode #7... EWWWWWW?

<CCCP> Bronysith okay!
<Jmo> Hm?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: So he's a brony hater now?
<Jmo> No-one takes my spot.

<Dken2021> and that would be?
<shibaru> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9wk5bdx901rywedzo1_500.jpg

<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: and a guy in a shirt saying brony, jacking off to it
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: .....................

<Cynder7> 6I need to find a better way to phrase my question so I can google it.. -.-
<CCCP> Wat*
<Cades> haha thats awesome :P
<Freefall29> Bronysith: :'(
<Cades> i dont know who that is :P
<Cynder7> 6Niaa! It's so cute! :D
<Dken2021> Bronysith who does that? sounds like a youtube partner
<Vivix> He's always been kind of a dick, but I don't think that really goes under anti
<Cynder7> 6*squish*
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: What video is it?
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: idk, remember seeing it before though
<Cynder7> 6Evil characters just have that badassness about them..it's usually impossible to resist their awesomeness xD
<Dken2021> ok that newsletter was pretty funny
<shibaru> Shullllkkkkkkk

<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: just trying to forget it
*derpherp calls Vivix

<BladedWings> CCCP: meeee
<Cades> yeah :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ok I believe this could be a good time to test something with the community
<Vivix> hm?
*Ryunosuke watches all the chaos
<CCCP> BladedWings get ready for 20 years in prison
<Vivix> D=?
<Bronysith> ughhhhhhhhhh. remember when you payed full price for a game and you actaully got a complete game? i miss those days
<BladedWings> CCCP: oh crap! you tricked me!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Allright guys if I say My Little Dashie what will you guys say?
<Cynder7> 6Oh.. :P Sosuke Aizen :P https://www.google.com/search?q=aizen&hl=en&rlz=1C1CHMY_enGR310GR311&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=F_BHUJPwBILatAbusIDgAQ&ved=0CC4QsAQ&biw=1280&bih=909
<Ryunosuke> Bronysith, ya, I do
<Vivix> I wouldn't really say anythin
<Kandarihu> Never read it, heard mixed reviews about it.
<Dovah> ahhh skyrim How I love that game :)
<BladedWings> CrimsonPhoenix: a fanfic
<Vivix> I rememer it, and I still do it Bronysith
<Spectrum_Rush> meh
<Vivix> The only thing I REALLY miss, are manuals and boxart
<Cades> he looks like a badass
<CrimsonPhoenix> How about Past Sins
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<Freefall29> Bronysith: yeah. these days you pay 40-60 bucks for a game (mass effect 3) and they have the balls to remove content from it and release it as DLC
<DerpyMuffins> Hi everypony
<Cades> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO..............
<Dken2021> me too Bronysith, even if it sucked, at least the devs gave it their all
<BladedWings> hi DerpyMuffins
<Spectrum_Rush> never read
<Vivix> Haven't read past sins yet, will soon
<Bronysith> Freefall29: not just taht game
<CCCP> BladedWings >:3
*derpherp hits Derpy with a crowbar because i`m a secret agent
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DerpyMuffins: Hi!
<BladedWings> havent read Past Sins
<thelonepony> hi DerpyMuffins
<Bronysith> Freefall29: try every single game that ever comes out by EA
<Derpy_Hooves> derpherp: D:
<Ryunosuke> look at games like
<Dovah> I eat secret agents :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> and now Background Pony
<DerpyMuffins> So what we watching?
<Cynder7> 6DDD:
<Vivix> EA != Gaming Industry
<Dken2021> ello there DerpyMuffins
<Freefall29> Derpy_Hooves: nothing
<Ryunosuke> Freelancer, X3
*derpherp glitches
<Ryunosuke> complete games on launch
<BladedWings> CrimsonPhoenix: Lyra and Octavia
<CrimsonPhoenix> BladedWings, no spoilers
<Vivix> Most games are complete on launch, dragging out the ones that aren't as examples is silly
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm only at chapter 2
<Cynder7> 6I'd say he is :P Don't know his character too much yet :P
<Ryunosuke> no special cutscenes
<Kandarihu> You know what? EA wasn't always this way. They used to be a productive member of the industry.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh....
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix: Probably that even though the fanfic is okay, MLD is highly overrated and has WAY too much attention.
<Ryunosuke> no FUCKING GOLDEN AMMO
<Ryunosuke> grrr
<derpherp> glitching is fun, glitching is fun, i`m as secret agent so i`m glitchinh again
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Homework, Past Sins
<Cynder7> 6He'll probably be back soon :3
<Vivix> Kandarihu, EA also used to be serious, they helped develop AIFF file format
<Cynder7> 6*waits*
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix: How is My Background Pony?
<Cades> i miss eldude :P
<BladedWings> CrimsonPhoenix: ohhh, nevermind XD
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm not sure about Past Sins, I haven't read that.
*Jmo nomths Vivix
<Cades> he hasn't been on for a long time
<Cynder7> 6WOOS
<CrimsonPhoenix> So far Background Pony is awesome
*Vivix cuddles Jmo and blastes Merzbow into his head
<Cynder7> 6Wb ^^
<Jmo> You all wish you had this.
<Jmo> ;~;
<Vivix> hehe

<CrimsonPhoenix> I read two chapters and in two chapters there was a story with deep thoughts coming from it.
<Kandarihu> I think we need to figure out how EA went from a good company to a maglignant tumor of the industry.
<Cades> I thought the grey man got you, Suinide
<CrimsonPhoenix> The writing is beautifull
<Cades> DAT LINK
<Cynder7> 6I like this guy more than Aizen though... :3
<derpherp> VIVIX Y U SCARE ME WIT DAT PIC ON DA MERZBOW DANG! :D
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix: Hmm.......what's the synopsis?
<Vivix> We don't need to figure it out, it just happened
<derpherp> i mean D:
<CrimsonPhoenix> I seriously recommend Backgrounf Pony over anything
<Vivix> derpherp, sorry ;__; I like the music
<Dken2021> Kandarihu I think around the time DLC was announced
<derpherp> wut music?
<Vivix> ze noiiise darling
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/Background-Pony
<Cades> lol...creepy
<Foxx_Ray> Hullo.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Read it there
<Dken2021> or when they bought the madden license, whichever
<CrimsonPhoenix> it pretty much says everything
*Cynder7 6is in the mood of spamming evil dude pictures
<Vivix> I dunno if I want to read that one
<Ryunosuke> its not so much that I hate dlc per se, but when you make the core game dls (story important characters) you tend to piss off the fans eventually, and golden ammo (OP guns, equips, etc) that can be bought for RL cash as part of promotions that can be used in MP, do absolutely NOTHING but piss off the people that doesnt have it
<Kandarihu> I can think of two things that happened with EA, that might have given the company a massive God-Complex. Getting the exclusive license to the NFL is one.
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Vivix> the description didn't capture me
<Cynder7> 6Ok,that sounded kinda bad..
<Suinide> Grey man?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, it's amazing
<derpherp> DAT HAD NO MUSIC!
<derpherp> IT DAT GLITCHY SCAREY THINGY!
<Cynder7> 6Aha..found one..
<CrimsonPhoenix> All you need to do is to throw aside all the fanon around Lyra first
<Vivix> CrimsonPhoenix, it might be- but it don't sound like my kinda thing- how she writes to youu and how she acknowledges she is a background pony in the description just don't sound like my kinda thing
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause it's a whole new character
<Cades> The grey mans from a game called LSD.
<Ryunosuke> on a side note
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, she knows that she's a pony like any other
<Kandarihu> The other is the fact that they didn't support the Sega Dreamcast, and the Dreamcast crashed and burned, and this was largely attributed to EA not publishing games on their console.
<Ryunosuke> Ubisoft said that they are ditching the always on DRM
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not really a break the fourth wall
<Ryunosuke> something about fans being pissed off and all that
<CrimsonPhoenix> heck it's a Journal type of story
<Ryunosuke> not working
<Ryunosuke> etc
<shibaru> The grey man is sexy
<derpherp> VIVIX DAT ONG GLITCHY THING DATS SCARY AND DA SCARY OICTURES IN MEH HEAD AND I~M GOING CRAZYYYYY
<CCCP> Needs moar 80s! This needs to be the 80s!
<Vivix> CrimsonPhoenix, okay- well maybe, but yeah- description didn't capture me right away. It might still be good, just not my taste
<CrimsonPhoenix> all she says is that she has a curse
<Dken2021> really? Ubisoft? well they may have won somebody today
<Bronysith> gaming has gone downhill so fucking much
<Suinide> Dunno
<Vivix> derpherp, hehe, glitch and noise can be wonderful. Merzbow is very hit or miss, some of his stuff is just stupid, and some sound--really mezmerizing
<DeadpoolDash> no stream it seems
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62IR-bs4hNo
<Vivix> I don't agree Bronysith, that's what kids say about music, and they are all wrong
<CCCP> Link every thing from the 80s!

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix: I hav to agree with Vivix, I'm not sure if this is something I would really read. Yes, it seems really good but I'm not really into this kind of stuff.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> *have*
<Cades> lol
<Dken2021> CCCP Leggins, hot leggings!
<Cynder7> 6Ok,time to think of another
<CCCP> Lol
<derpherp> VIVIX U OWE MEH !) AWSOME SONG YOUTUBE LINKS AND A TEADY BEAR!
<CrimsonPhoenix> well for those that want sometihng sad
<CrimsonPhoenix> Go with Background Pony
<Vivix> derpherp, what do you like? Calm music?
<Bronysith> Vivix: downhill in terms of difficulty and challenge i should say

<Vivix> Oh I don't have anything like that derpherp -
<Dark92Enigma> About Lyra recognizing she's a background pony.....i just read the 1st chapter
<CCCP> I like sad fanfics more than most ones
<Prince_Lightboom> im a fan of rainbow factory
<Vivix> I really like sad
<Cades> i suck at drawing :P
<Vivix> but it's hard to find good sad
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03While I was waiting for my next class, I read The Last Sonic Rainboom. It was... short
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, any thoughts?
<derpherp> wut duh fuq is dat Bladed ._.
<Cynder7> 6I was drawing something but something about it bothers me and Idk how to fix it so I've kinda stopped lately..But the last 3 months I had been drawing quite a bit..
<Ryunosuke> I prefer slice of lifes, comedy, adventure, a bit of dark (not too much though)
<Vivix> I like dark, romance, adventure and sad
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Cades> That's good.
<Vivix> not really comedy fan outside of cartoons
<Ryunosuke> the best fanfic I have read was "a"
<Dark92Enigma> I like sad fanfics with a touch of adventure
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Bronysith> I like Princess Molestia Fanfic
<Prince_Lightboom> OK WILL WE STOP TALKIN BOUT FANFICS
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> If I'm going to read fanfics, I would probably say that I would like slice of life, comedy, adventure, and normal.

<CrimsonPhoenix> thank you
<Bronysith> princess molestia is a good fanficiton, that is great and highly detailed
<Vivix> which one Bronysith?
<Prince_Lightboom> HEY
<magmablock> Idon't think I'll ever take a look at a fanfic with the word "Molest" in the title
<Prince_Lightboom> WAT AM I THINKIN BOUT
<Vivix> yeah I read that one Bronysith
<Dken2021> Prince_Lightboom being loud?
<Bronysith> Vivix: and lunaughty?
<Prince_Lightboom> no
<Vivix> I dunno, I thought it was - interesting, but it used to be tagged Teen and had--it was as if everything was withou genitalia
<Prince_Lightboom> watching pewdiepie
<Vivix> it was kinda odd, but interesting story
<Vivix> Yeah I read Lunaughty too, same deal- Interesting story
<Prince_Lightboom> may someone play pewdiepie plzzz
<Vivix> The LAST one, about twilight lost me completely, I was bored halfway thru the first two chapters-
<Dark92Enigma> The thing is i read sad fanfics with sad BGM from any anime: Dragon Ball Z / Saint Seiya / Sailor Moon
<Dark92Enigma> as BGM
<derpherp> Vivix u give me 10 song youtube links of songs liek dis:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA3O7V_yVcA :D

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Prince_Lightboom: They'll request when they want to.

<Vivix> derpherp, http://youtu.be/HypcjdSNsAQ http://youtu.be/LgTpCmEW94I would be the closest I got- unless I have to dig through glitch synths-
<Ryunosuke> EA already has an MMO, Ultima Online, and they want ALL their games to be psuedo-mmo's
<Vivix> not really the same
<derpherp> GLITCHES :D
<derpherp> wut kind of glitches u speak of O3O
<Bronysith> so time for uncomfortable talk, what u guys think of R34?
<Vivix> CCCP, Pewdie? The best series he ever made, in my opinion, was to the moon. He actually seemed like he enjoyed it, but he seems kinda sick of horror
<EnderPillow|Minecraf> Here guys, have some awesome music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP0f5rvVkAU&hd=1
<CCCP> It make sad that not a lot of games have cheats anymore.. :(
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: Let's not go there.......
<CCCP> modern*
<Prince_Lightboom> play plz > http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRqayjGOpYc <
<Vivix> Well, the only opinion on R34 for that matters is your own, so no- useless discussion
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Bronysith: This really isn't the place for this.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome|Homework: good point
<JESmith71> Rule 34? Uhhh...."Hey look a moose!"
<derpherp> VIVIX wut kind of glitches u speak of of glitch synths?
<Vivix> CCCP, me too- I miss consoles
<Vivix> Glitches--uhh..
<CCCP> JESmith71 swerve outta the way.,!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Random question: What's your favorite kind of pancakes?

*CCCP dies from moose in road

<Vivix> CCCP, and by consoles I mean--dev consoles- with cheats and commands and whatnot-
<PillowPoni> Scoot-Scootaloo: Somewhat
<Cades> i wish i actually enjoyed drawing
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> My favorite kind of pancakes are Bacon Pancakes or Chocolate Chip pancakes.

<Vivix> a song abou CS
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anyways, I'm looking for the swedish version of All I ever Wanted, do you know where I can find it?
<Bronysith> i miss the SNES and the NES and n64 and ps1 and ps2
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03that's not on youtube...
<CCCP> I admit to watching Jenna Marbles..
<derpherp> but wut r da glitch synths supost ta mean
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03or maybe a youtube link or something
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OzWIFX8M-Y
<Suinide> Damn connection
<Cades> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> ooooooh
<Dken2021> Scoot-Scootaloo oh, you listen to the stuf my old roomate would put on alot
<Vivix> derpherp, glitching synths are synths that..are made to fail or break up in certain ways- in unmusical ways- circuit bending or just weird patches and settings
<CrimsonPhoenix> well......
<Vivix> it's supposed to sound destroyed and ruined, glitching
<Suinide> Wish i had the guts to write
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh that's it....?
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh.........I've heard that song before.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's the same beat
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Huh... I thought it would be... cooler
<Vivix> hehe
<CrimsonPhoenix> but
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dota is cool
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Who's supposed to be streaming?
<CCCP> The only really famous youtuber that I never found slightly funny was Fred, luckily no one cares about him anymore.
<Vivix> Hehe
<PillowPoni> derpherp: PinkiePieSwear is damn good at using glitching in his songs
<Barbetos> whaaa!!
<Vivix> a lot of the old youtubers are gone
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP: Was he funny at all?
<CrimsonPhoenix> You should hear about the swedish version of while your gone
<Barbetos> My team is cs go is so baaadd.
<PillowPoni> derpherp: Example: Sunshine and Celery Stalks
<Vivix> my favourite youtuber is Sips and Sjin- calmest sexiest voices out there
<Barbetos> Oh well. I am having fun.
<Dken2021> even crius croker?
<CrimsonPhoenix> while You're gone
<Cynder7> 6I wish I could write with more detail in school shit.. x)
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome nope
<CCCP> Not a bad person, just not funny...
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf2wbRWb9xI
<derpherp> yah like if i take a missing no and mix mix mix it wit a song like a yoshi island song i`ll get glitch synths?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03isn't it now your gone?
<CrimsonPhoenix> nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's about a bot in IRC
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP: And can you believe that they gave him his own show AND three movies?
<JRPHONE> Phase4:
<icefang99> Hey people. ._.
<Phase4> JRPHONE,
<Cades> hey icefang!
<CrimsonPhoenix> very fitting
<Suinide> Hmm
<Vivix> derpherp, ehm...maybe- glitching is a technique- it's hard to explain. but for instance glitching synths as in circuit bending is--destroying something- just a sec
<icefang99> Half of my favorite online game hates me now.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Barrington Levy?
<Suinide> Ce..
<Suinide> Ice...*
<Prince_Lightboom> IM BAK
<Prince_Lightboom> <.<
<derpherp> Vivix if i took a yoshi island song and put missingno together with it i`ll get glitching synths
<Cynder7> 6Hiya ^^
<icefang99> Practically because I played a villain and decapitated a leader but so what e.e
<Prince_Lightboom> still nothin

<BladedWings> hi Prince_Lightboom
<derpherp> right?
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome I actually watched one of the movies because I'm stupid I wanted to see if it was really bad, but was surprised at how bad it was.
<Prince_Lightboom> ill be bak if i hear pewdiepies voice here
<icefang99> And hai. :3
<Dken2021> don't think that will happen
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03We don't take too kindly to pewdiepie here...

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Anyways, speaking of streams...
<Vivix> derpherp, noo- not really- eh glitching is a technique- like beat hopping and mixing in harshnoise and such-
<Suinide> Hmm...
<Cynder7> 6Like a boss seems pretty appropriate here somehow.. x3
<CCCP> Scoots how about Nova?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP: I literally couldn't stand to watch any of the episodes. I tried watching JUST one, and I was sick of it in five minutes.
<Vivix> I'm trying to find a glitching nintendo synth

<PillowPoni> Eugene~ and that clumsy kid
<LunarRepublicGuard> HA
<Kandarihu> tSparx, if he were to spy on us, he'd probably use the embedded chat and be one of the pony_ users.
<Ponies47> I'm ok

<PillowPoni> Aaand Helga
<Cades> Truth is,even though I see it all over the place,I'm still not exactly sure what it is anymore..

<MASF123> Helga G. Patacki
<superretroworld> tSparx: who hates white turkey, its ham that has no flavour
<Cynder7> basically, its the sound transformers make when they have sex
<MASF123> Mr. Simmons. Lol.
<tSparx> Kandarihu And if he were to troll us, he'd take a name insultingly similar name to his real name and refuse to blow his cover :$
<Cades> O.O
<sub06905> Ham is better that Turkey
<JESmith71> superretroworld: Unless it's a |Honey Baked Ham
<Cypresswolf> Amen Harold
<Cynder7> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB76MjtDPSU
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I'm not one to like turkey, but my favorite kind of turkey is fried turkey.
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Freefall29> amen, now give me that turkey
<tSparx> White Turkey < Decent Ham < Dark Turkey < Good Ham < Steak
<superretroworld> JESmith71: only if its deli aka sliced ham
<PillowPoni> Turkey is delicious. And it's the only thing that's truly fat-free
<Wirisme> Now I'm really hungry
<ponies24> YUM YUM YUM YUM
<Cynder7> this is raw, unedited audio of 2 transformers having sex
<LadyCanary> Fsteak
<Kandarihu> tSparx, if he has no sense of stealth. And trolling us while going by a similar name to his real one? That would be close to suicide.

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> BladedWings: She's so underground, Knuckles could take lessons from her. :D
<PillowPoni> Sometimes I want to punch her
<SpeedyBolt> I always thought the tall one was ugly.

<LadyCanary> ...Oh god. D.W....the one character that I hated more than Muffy.
<Wirisme> Never heard them, haven't heard the name in like over a decade
<LunarRepublicGuard> MrMalk think of it on a political point of view :)
<shibaru> Can I put your heart in my unicalade while it's still beating? o__o
<JESmith71> That Sharon Lois and Bram song
<PillowPoni> Dat gong
<SpeedyBolt> You hated D.W, LadyCanary?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I NEVER liked D.W. :S
<JESmith71> GONG'd. You fail DW
<Wirisme> I just made myself feel old by using the word decade
<DocSane> I found DW to be a fairly realistic little sister
<Cypresswolf> :O the Elephant Song...how long has it been since I last heard that?
<MASF123> I TOLD YOU NOT TO.....Touch it! :[
<LadyCanary> SpeedyBolt: She was quite annoying, yes. >_>
<SpeedyBolt> She kinda reminds me of when I was young.

<Uryu> 6shi
<Uryu> 6Cyn
<Cades> that'll be just confusing haha, its too short.
<Uryu> 6pri
<VenHur> MASF123: God that episode gave me nightmares...

<LadyCanary> Who can pass up that offer? :3
<MASF123> Binky is a funny ass name.

<Wirisme> I take it only mods can stream?
<MASF123> Even though it's called Arthur the show doesn't only revolve around him. Great if only EVERY show did that.
<Dken2021> geoge's thoughts: only the dead can know peace from this buffer
<DocSane> Although you all might be weirded out by what I'd stream
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone know a good B movie?
<LadyCanary> XDD

<AJIsAwesome> FusRohYAY_87: Hi! :)

<Dken2021> scout19_tf2 no ones knows sadly
<AJIsAwesome> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<MASF123> no it's not.
<FusRohYAY_87> still unknown
<oni_link> sonicandmario85: i meant like buying newer hardware in the near future. I did something similar to what you said though XD At my workplace, I have a ton of IBM T42s and they were made for XP back in 05 and I got Windows 7on them. I was surprised that those things could even run it :D
<flutterchu> PinkieDinky:im SOOOOOOO happy
<Dken2021> oh man, I think it's using actual 3D models instead of sprites http://derpy.me/sUg4V
<FusRohYAY_87> :'( atill dont know when they'll air the next season :'(
<MASF123> Not even Tom knows when the next episode air time is. D:
<Kandarihu> So I was thinking. It's SlurryMoon's Birthday today. Wouldn't it be cool if he were to stream for us? It's been ages since he last streamed.
<AJIsAwesome> FusRohYAY_87: Probably in the fall.
<LunarRepublicGuard> do anypony know the date of mlp s3?
<scout19_tf2> how does no one know it ses on saturdays in september
<MASF123> no
<flutterchu> Dken2021: twas announced on court-records
<FusRohYAY_87> Rumoprs are they start at the beginning of OCt
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Trye. But I'll probably be asleep by then.
<FusRohYAY_87> they usually do tat
<sonicandmario85> oni_link:my dad cant afford new hardware worst part is this computer is designed for windows 98 and im running xp on it this was made before xp even came out
<MASF123> Only The Hub knows.
<oni_link> Dken2021: Looks similar to his MvC character model :P
<AJIsAwesome> Don't believe rumors. Most of them turn out to be false.
<MASF123> Yeah.
<FusRohYAY_87> Celestias trolling us :$
<AJIsAwesome> Only the Hub knows when.
<Kandarihu> I would've asked earlier, but I had to go afk a lot, and didn't want to miss anything if SlurryMoon were to stream.
<flutterchu> EVERYPONY POINT YOUR HOOVES YELL OBJECTION AS LOUD AS YOU COULD (bad rap)
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: WHat did SlurryMoon use to stream?
<Dken2021> all I know is, I have a reason to own a 3DS immidietly
<scout19_tf2> well im still checking on the hub on saturday
<sonicandmario85> oni_link:when i try running TF2 it says memory cannot be read i dont remember the error code things on it
<HoodyNinja> scout19_tf2: wait till they announce it, man
<oni_link> sonicandmario85: the fact that its lasted you this long is amazing all in its own :) but yeah you could get yourself a decent and fairly new barebones kit for around $325
<superretroworld> just found out michael clarke duncan died, he was a great actor :(
<Kandarihu> I had to prepare dinner for once, since my mom had a terrible headache.
<flutterchu> im also exited for the professor layton crossover with ace attorney even though all i know of it was i watched a movie
<scout19_tf2> they have announced it
<oni_link> Kandarihu: how did that go?
<tSparx> When the official announcement comes, this place'll be lit up like a Christmas tree the size of New York.
<sonicandmario85> oni_link:my dads broke from that vacation in flagstaff we had
<Kandarihu> oni_link, it went well, but mom helped a lot.
<sonicandmario85> he doesnt have much money left
<tSparx> The entire Internet will be ablaze.
<Ryunosuke> all the tv schedules are not announcing a new ep saturday
<FusRohYAY_87> Oni-channn when u gonna air the next episode :S
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Yep. Probably 150+ people. :D
<NocturnalBlade|TF2> dat trixie
<tSparx> The entire Internet is *already* ablaze, and there hasn't been an announcement yet xD
<oni_link> sonicandmario85: oh well just know that its a possibility :P
<FusRohYAY_87> rofl that trixie is pro
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Maybe even 200+ people here.
<flutterchu> oni chan,dan:NOW YOU FUCKED UP
<oni_link> Kandarihu: so she pretty much supervised :P
<Ryunosuke> afaik, sat eps are Ticket master, Best Night EVER, and Canterlot Wedding parts 1&2
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Yeah, there's no way I'll be around for long that day xD
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, SlurryMoon would stream Youtube videos of his choosing, but one time, he streamed his physical modification of a fighting game stick. That was an interesting time.
<FusRohYAY_87> But ONichAN!!!!
<Kandarihu> oni_link, only for the fish.
<scout19_tf2> ok on utube look up mlp season 3 there will be 2 vids saying its on sat
<oni_link> Kandarihu: ah
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Hmm, sounds nice. I really would like to see him stream. :)
<Shizuka> 13DERP
<Dken2021> Kandarihu I think that was DCD that did the fighting stick
<Ryunosuke> and you trust EVERYTHING on youtube wholehartedly?
<NocturnalBlade|TF2> :D
<Shizuka> 13today shizu learned that f5 forces a reconnect
<AJIsAwesome> scout19_tf2: Once again, only the HUB knows.
<NocturnalBlade|TF2> poor Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> They'll announce the next season when they want to.
<flutterchu> season 3 trixie is gonna be a boss http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8mbgkeQaq1rs6uheo1_500.jpg
<Ryunosuke> or when the tv listings show
<LunarRepublicGuard> only 2 songs have been release 4 s3 mlp
<FusRohYAY_87> everyone seeing those posts about waiting for season 3?
<Ryunosuke> no spoilers
<AJIsAwesome> FusRohYAY_87: Yep.
<tSparx> flutterchu: Oi!
<FusRohYAY_87> Just skeletons at computers
<sonicandmario85> flutterchu:so is trixie not gonna be a bitch when she comes back?
<Kandarihu> Dken2021, oh, right. Okay. Was it SlurryMoon who streamed Mother 3 for a fundraiser last year, which played after pony episode premiers?
<tSparx> flutterchu: Don't post Ssn3 stuff on here!
<scout19_tf2> yes and there kick ass
<tSparx> Halt es!
<Dken2021> Kandarihu dunno, I don;t think I was there for that
<sonicandmario85> flutterchu: is trixie not gonna be a bitch in season 3?
<AJIsAwesome> I think either Trixie or Gilda should have a redemtion episode.
<flutterchu> tSparx: i cant post season 3 spoilers but i can spoil ace attorney 5 ?
<AJIsAwesome> *redemption*
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: Did you read the rules?
<Ryunosuke> also
<tSparx> flutterchu: One of those is against the rules of this channel. The other is about ace attorney 5.
<FusRohYAY_87> They should end season 3 with an invasion of all the past villans of MLP and have them destroy Ponyville with a cliffhanger ending of the season
<superretroworld> the Gilda Redemption
<tSparx> *That's right, you'd better run.*
<Ryunosuke> scout19_tf2, /r/mylittlepony has NOTHING on S3 episodes yet
<Dken2021> flutterchu well if this were a ace attorney fan site, we might have a different tune
<tSparx> :P
<Ryunosuke> and if ANYONE would have anything on s3, reddit would
<AJIsAwesome> ANY DISCUSSION OR SPOILERS OF SEASON WILL RESULT IN A BAN/KICK.
<scout19_tf2> its funny no one eva reads da rules first
<LunarRepublicGuard> fusRohYAY_87: O_o
<AJIsAwesome> *SEASON 3*
<flutterchu> i didnt read that one :(
<Ryunosuke> AJIsAwesome, discussion is fine, just no spoilers :)
<scout19_tf2> buuuuut the songs
<FusRohYAY_87> wa we cant discuss it? its not real, only rael thing are the songs
<Ryunosuke> well discussion is technically off limits
<FusRohYAY_87> speculations hmmm
<tSparx> Ryunosuke: "Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban." --The channel's topic.
<PillowPoni> Everyonr talking about the two forbidden words...
<PillowPoni> Better hide
<superretroworld> we should go on a strike till they make more episodes
<Ryunosuke> I see that, however, I dont think discussing WHEN s3 will air constitutes what they are saying
<scout19_tf2> hell yea
<flutterchu> tSparx: sorry PLEASE DONT BAN ME *cries*
<Ryunosuke> I think they mean ep discussions etc
<Phase4> damned fire alarms
<Ryunosuke> as in content
<Spectrum_Rush> tSparx: anyone on the site embed chat doesnt see the topic by default
<princess> I GTG D:
<tSparx> flutterchu: I'm not a mod. I can't ban you :P
<Phase4> bbl
<Dken2021> superretroworld that would end badly like the sonic 4 boycott
<FusRohYAY_87> nooooo forgive me :'(
<princess> :'( bye
<tSparx> Spectrum_Rush: 'Swhy I quoted it :)
<superretroworld> Dken2021: what happened there?
<Kandarihu> Yeah. The timing of S3 is perfectly okay to discuss. Episodes of S3 that have already aired (after a certain time) are okay. If we're still waiting for it, it's off limits.
<tSparx> bye princess!
<Dken2021> superretroworld the fans were enraged how sonic 4 looked, and tried to boycott sega... by purchasing any sonic 1 port
<Spectrum_Rush> tSparx: yes... but your quote will be lost to the flow of thae chat to anyone joining just after :)
<scout19_tf2> srry everypony bout da spoilin i know were all waiting despritly for it
<tSparx> Spectrum_Rush: But I wasn't talking to them. I was talking to the people already here :)
<flutterchu> i thought i died form wrek's ban hammer :'(
<FusRohYAY_87> so im guessing we can talk abotu the songs?
<oni_link> Okay on XChat how do I change the sounds for my pings?
<tSparx> scout19_tf2: Hahaha no.
<Dken2021> FusRohYAY_87 no songs or anything

<oni_link> I like em all except for the very first one. And by all of them, I mean all of the Genesis titles
<Spectrum_Rush> Und dann all the newies were afraid of tSparx XD

<Dken2021> ah, did like sonic3k, but I always liked 2

*PillowPoni throws a welcome pillow at Meanwhile
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Hi! :)
<Meanwhile> MvM shenanigans. They same to be missing a player.
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], he's concerned about your own hearing. If you have your headphones up so loud that other people can hear it, then it's going to cause permanent damage to your hearing.
<tSparx> Dken2021: Y'know, tbh, Idk what the definition of a master bedroom, but they have our biggest bedroom, it takes up about a quarter of the basement.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And then when he gets into a argument with me he threatens to hit me!
<VenHur> Sup Meanwhile?
<Sylandest> evening, everypony!
<tSparx> How old are you SpadeMagnes[R] ?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I took my headphones off to hear the volume, its not that loud

<Sylandest> everypony doing alright tonight?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> But enough of my own issues... how is everyone doing...
<AJIsAwesome> Sylandest: Yep. Finishing up some homework. :D
<tSparx> Dken2021: Yeah, they have the master bedroom then :) Though the bathroom's next door.

<tSparx> So I get that +o is for chanOps, what's +v stand for?
<Wirisme> aww
<Dken2021> oh I remeber now
<DashWithRainbows> +v is voice Wirisme.
<AJIsAwesome> flutterchu: That would make a GREAT duet in S3, IMO. :O
<DashWithRainbows> i mean tSparx.
<tSparx> DashWithRainbows: Voice?
<Wirisme> what?
<flutterchu> AJIsAwesome: thank you :$ id love that
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> is CSGO any good? heard its on psn and was thinkin of picking it up once my ps3 gets fixed
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: What's it stand for?
<FusRohYAY_87> Global Ops
<DashWithRainbows> Wirisme Sorry, thought his message was your message.
<FusRohYAY_87> i think
<Wirisme> np
<Wirisme> what does that mean anyway?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Counter Strike Global Offense
<FusRohYAY_87> o i c
<DashWithRainbows> tSparx Basically, when +m is in effect, those with + beside their name will still be able to talk, alongside those with @ and %
<Dken2021> but yea, I know of hertzdevil cause he really can use that program like a freaking artist
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I hear it's pretty good.. I'm not into military games.
<AJIsAwesome> DashWithRainbows: So you could talk to us right now?
<twilight_sprinkle> from what i saw, CS:GO isnt much of an improvement from cs:source
<oni_link> Dken2021: Im glad those dudes arent total douchebags though. When theyre on theyre pretty cool people. If youre not paying attention though you will get lost in their conversations and jokes FAST XD they were really bored one time and they were acting as eachother. Oh and occasionally Mexican Sunflower gets on. He goes by meckz or something like that now :P
<twilight_sprinkle> but cs:source was good.
<flutterchu> despite capcom canceling megaman legends 3 and megaman universe and not putting him in mvc3.......TWICE ill give it a second chance
<tSparx> DashWithRainbows: I mean usermodes. I've +ix (though I don't think this channel recognizes +x mode), and +o is chanOps, so what's +v Voice mean?
<Cades> fahahahahahahaha
<Cades> wahahahahahahaha

<QuinnThePegaSistta> Im not goign to asnwer that
<tSparx> MASF123: Things that writers do just to please the fans of the show
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i know the feeling w/ Super Sentai and *shudders* power rangers...
<tSparx> MASF123: Often in anime taking the form of getting random pantie shots
<Wirisme> They have this thing of importing american documentaries and dubbing them over with british narrators.. it seems extremely pointless to me
<flutterchu> DID HE REALLY SAY THAT
<Shizuka> 13which
<Phobos2390> He actually said that.
<tSparx> MASF123: Or gratuitous shots, lady stepping out of the shower, etc. etc. :P

<Ninjazz> Oh, Scout.
<Kandarihu> All just a daydream
<Kammerjunk> God, I love railings.
<Cades> I would just try to talk to him about it, maybe right after you stop recording?
<Ninjazz> Everything needs a few more railings.
<shibaru> Yea, maybe
<Kammerjunk> At least he didn't say "That's a BIG package!"
<twilight_sprinkle> didnt we watch this episdoe like yesterday

<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I'm at a point financially right now where I have to be really careful what I spend my money on.
<Gold_Demona> I'm avoiding the Steam shop for that reason.
<Jmo> Understandable then Gold_Demona :)
<AdamTheDuck> And for once a innocent wallet survives the horrors of the Steam sales...
<AdamTheDuck> an(
<AdamTheDuck> an*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: fair enough then

<Gold_Demona> Yeah, we just bought a car, so we're not sure what the bill is gonna do to us. Until we get settled into the payments, I'm abstaining from making any unnecessary purchases. =/
<Jmo> Completely fair.
<AdamTheDuck> Dosh
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Agreed with Jmo
<seatsea> Phase4: is it normal that you dont have your coulorded text like you usaly do?
<Phase4> is it normal that i normal
<seatsea> ok
<Jmo> I rarely buy games on Steam due to the fact I have too many ;~;
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Steam sales are my bane. :P
<Jmo> Indeed.
<Gold_Demona> I bought the entire Assassin's Creed series and Skyrim during the summer sale.
<Jmo> Eh Assassin's Creed
<Gold_Demona> Haven't played any of them yet. XP
<Jmo> Still yet to get into that series properly
<Gold_Demona> I hear it's good, which is why I bought it.
<seatsea> what is this game?
<Jmo> I've played the first one, it is decent. But I gotta be in the mood >.<
<AdamTheDuck> welcome back TheRandomkid321 :P

<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: i love sweetie belle that i have the hole keyboard WITH a japanese keyboard
<seatsea> all those 4th wall breakings
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: I have BF3 premium. :P I hate it so much. But it's the only way to get weapons that kill something.
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu ... doesnt a japenese keyboard have fewer keys?
<Klumzeedragon> seatsea: Whatcha eating man?
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: yes
<AdamTheDuck> Klumzeedragon, EA in a nutshell...
<Klumzeedragon> seatsea: And sorry I don't have skype.
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: i love sweetie belle so much i anonymouse all the tublr's (even sweetie poo)
<seatsea> Klumzeedragon: some leftover pasta that i put in the micro wave and then aded some ketchup
<TheRandomkid321> yep a $100 for an $80 doller game. And it is just about needed in order to get half good weapons.
<Klumzeedragon> But I agree AdamTheDuck. That's why I prefer my Call of Duty Elite, even though I now hate MW3, but I like how it didn't give me an edge over everpony else. :/
<flutterchu> seatsea: KETCHUP!!!!!!!!!!!!! OuO GIMME KETCHUP!!!!!!!!!!!
<seatsea> lol
<MadSurge> :D SO MANY ZOMBIES IN DUNWICH
<AdamTheDuck> Klumzeedragon, Jesus I know right, even I like CoD more than EA now... EA just killed so many good things...
<Klumzeedragon> But OH! TheRandomkid321 do you own BF3 already?
<flutterchu> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/201/d/2/fluttershy_and_pikachu_by_redboypivot12-d580ltw.png ketchup............ I <3 ketchup
<Klumzeedragon> Cause if not just wait 5 more days and they're coming out with BF3 Premium Edition.
<killerpony7733> Klumzeedragon i bought mine by retail yeah
<killerpony7733> Not premium
<seatsea> when i was younger i had to have ketchup on everthing i ate
<Jmo> klrpwny73 pls
<Klumzeedragon> seatsea: I have never had ketchup on pasta. :D Sounds interesting.
<seatsea> also for one moment i would only eat rice with ketchup or fish fingers with ketchup
<seatsea> Klumzeedragon: i never have plain pasta if there is no sauce like chese or something i put letchup
<CrimsonPhoenix> You have to go by the rhythm
<seatsea> mistipe not letchup ketchup
<MadSurge> What's yam anyway?
<CrimsonPhoenix> have we seen the bat yet?
<Klumzeedragon> killerpony7733: Ah. :P Cause if you didnt have it, BF3 Premium Edition is coming out. Which is the game and premuim for like $70 or $80.
<Klumzeedragon> CrimsonPhoenix: This isn't a live stream. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> SHIT
<TheRandomkid321> Klumzeedragon... F$&%

<Phase4> ^ educational facts about beer
*seatsea is now having creme caramel which he has forgot the english name
<Klumzeedragon> killerpony7733: I agree, but I mean if you didn't have the game, it would be less expensive to do it with the Bf3 Premium edition. But if you already own it, then yeah, just buy the premium. :D
<killerpony7733> Klumzeedragon indeed.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Night all ^-^

<Klumzeedragon> AdamTheDuck: And I agree... The only time that DLC was good, was like the first year of the new gens. Now everyone has taken advantage and is like, "Hurp Derp, you can buy costumes and other asthetic things for your game for all the money~"
<TheRandomkid321> Flutterchu Yes but still... anyway I gotta go.
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-7Juqpgl1o&feature=related

<MadSurge> *:D
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: That brodyquest. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, you'll be surprised as I know a few bands that do that.
<Wrek> 05mine was clash

<Phase4> and that makes me feel :3
<seatsea> it's wired before i became a brony i did not know that brony's exicted and since i beacme a brony i have heard a few youtubers talk about the subject

<Klumzeedragon> Jmo: Yeah, the animation is amazing.
<DoctoDoctorWho> does no one want anything to do with my first fanfic?:(
<Jmo> Tis indeed.

<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek: and thanks
<Jmo> That'd be an interesting read.
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: :D That seems like a tough task. But I always think of Blueblood as Dinkleberg thanks to WoonaStuck.

*AdamTheDuck lights the tumbleweed on fire
<PsychoticDoc> i am too tired to type
*AdamTheDuck sits around burning tumbleweed
<PsychoticDoc> also im waiting for me to have to leave so i can listen to triage at dawn again
*AdamTheDuck passes around the marshmallows
<Kandarihu> So, does the stream ever go back to Mother 3? Or is it just nothing but pony videos to celebrate when they reached their goal?
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivj744i4HoA i love dis source
<Dark_Horst> you're also aware that you're not supposed to post videolinks during streams?
<Kandarihu> It's kind of an afk stream.

<Dark_Horst> right now we have music from youtube via livestream
<Kandarihu> It is a recycled Mother 3 stream. But the stream is at the point where they reached their donation goal. So the guy just streamed pony videos. It's more of a recycled stream of pony videos.

<Kandarihu> Ponies47, Slurrymoon. But this was back during a fundraiser they did a long time before I joined.
<Ponies47> Kandarihu: Oh yeah I remeber thad Bronyfunds
<Ponies47> *that
<flutterchu> my brother doesnt play terrerria anymore because it's not gonna get updated anymore
<Malavolent> What is this Terraria about?
<Kandarihu> Malavolent, it's kind of a 2D Minecraft
<Malavolent> Sounds interesting.
<AdamTheDuck> Malavolent, Looks like 2D Minecraft just with less emphasis on building and more onto exploring and getting loot
<Malavolent> And it is multiplayer as well, I suppose?
<AdamTheDuck> Two very different games might I add
<AdamTheDuck> Eeyup
<Ninjazz> Think a mixture of Castlevania, metroid and a bit of minecraft.
<Ninjazz> Also, hey Malavolent.
<flutterchu> Ninjazz: oh yeah a BIT!!!!!
<Malavolent> Heya, Ninjazz.
<Ponies47> Dat Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> And yes, Malavolent, it has MP.
<Ninjazz> Dat Ponies47.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Inception much?
<thelonepony> hi Ninjazz
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Scoot-Scootaloo
<Ponies47> Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
<Ninjazz> flutterchu, well, probably a chunk.
*AdamTheDuck licks Scoot-Scootaloo
<Ninjazz> Hey, thelonepony.
<flutterchu> ill be right back im gonna go play minecraft
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I assume this is phase streamin'?
<Ninjazz> Scoot-Scootaloo, Bwaaaaaang.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03and mornin' y'all!
<Ninjazz> Mornin', Scoots.
<Malavolent> Who is streaming?
<Malavolent> I want to hug him for that Octavia wall.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^We demand to know who is streaming!
<AdamTheDuck> Scoot-Scootaloo, nope, it's not Phase/
<AdamTheDuck> Scoot-Scootaloo, take a guess :P
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, it's an archived stream from Slurrymoon.
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, aww you ruined the fun
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That sneaky bugger~
<Ninjazz> Oh. You guys are still watching the default Livestream feed?
<Malavolent> This Terraria, is it free?
<AdamTheDuck> Malavolent, nope, it's on Steam
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, no, but it's VERY cheap. It usually goes into sale often too.
<Ponies47> You know I have this game and haven't even installed it yet :$
<AdamTheDuck> Only $10 I think and $2.50 when on sale.
<Kandarihu> Malavolent, Terraria goes on discount from time to time. That's another way it differs from Minecraft
<Ninjazz> Malavolent, I recommend it. It's alot of fun. Especially with a buddy or 2.
<Malavolent> Ok, I'll give it a try some time.
<Ponies47> People keep telling me to get Minecraft :<
*Ponies47 Killed the chat
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Laserpon3 is mlg~

<Gold_Demona> ohai MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> the chat is pretty much ded at this time :)?
<MaxTheBrony> Who is streaming?
<Wirisme> yeah this is the slowest I've seen it
<Gold_Demona> I'm crocheting at the moment, so I'm less responsive than usual
<Jmo> Whatchu making Gold_Demona o.o
<Gold_Demona> A sweater. :3
<Gold_Demona> For my uncle.
<Jmo> Anytype of pattern?
<Gold_Demona> Fisherman's Crocheted Pullover, to be specific
<Jmo> Fair enough
<Emil> What is this game?
<Emil> Filled with so many wonders?
<Gold_Demona> Earthbound
<Emil> What is it about?
<Jmo> Muffins. Tis about muffins.
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> Alien invasion
<Gold_Demona> And muffins
<Wirisme> :P
<Emil> Oh, muffins and aliens.
<Jmo> Alien muffin invasion.
<Emil> Win.
<Gold_Demona> alien invasion of muffins
<Emil> Alien muffins or muffin alien invasion?
<Jmo> Which ever makes your boat float.
<Emil> Will I get drowned in alien space-muffins, or get killed by muffin-shaped aliens?
<Jmo> Ask Gold_Demona, she contributed to this.
<Emil> I'm lazy X.X
<Gold_Demona> lol, Um... I think I like the alien space-muffins
<Emil> Alright.
<Emil> Do they taste cool?
<Gold_Demona> They taste alien. =P
<Emil> Makes sense.
<JRP|temp> Phase4:
<Jmo> We're genius ;~;
<JRP|temp> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<JRP|temp> !orly
<MaxTheBrony> wait first episode is out?
<MaxTheBrony> or?
<MadSurge> :D RAYMAN
<Wirisme> :D
<MadSurge> MaxTheBrony: Nope, typing !cd males Tom all giddy
<MadSurge> *makes
<Wirisme> I need to play rayman 1 now
<Wirisme> If only I had it
<Gold_Demona> Regrettably, I've never played any Rayman game.
<Wirisme> First game was awesome and I played a little bit of 2 a couple years ago
<Wirisme> I shoudl get back to that
<Wirisme> I preferred 2D though
<MadSurge> GAH 3D CAN'T KEEP UP
<Troy> Hey
<Wirisme> And I stopped playing sonic before it went 3D
<sonicandmario85> SONIC GENERATIONS
<Wirisme> I still play the early games though
<sonicandmario85> :d
<Wirisme> occasionally
<Troy> Mario is just about 20% cooler
<Troy> :)
<Wirisme> I was a sonic kid and even I agree with that
<Troy> But they both had their moments
<Gold_Demona> Most of the newer Sonic games are pretty bad, but I really liked Generations
<sonicandmario85> Troy:sonics faster and hes a bit similar to rainbow dash but cant fly
<Troy> hes RD's hedgehog cousin? :P
<Gold_Demona> sonicandmario85 He can when he's Super Sonic. :P
<Gold_Demona> Super Sonic can fly
<Wirisme> SS completely broke sonic 2
<Wirisme> literally, it froze my game once
<sonicandmario85> Troy:well they sorta both have the same speed exept RD gets the speed by flying
<Gold_Demona> I remember the first time I got Super Sonic in Sonic 2. I was used to Sonic 1 at the time and never got Super Sonic before. It was freaking awesome
<Wirisme> It makes wing fortress hard as hell lol
<sonicandmario85> i have sonic 2 on an emulator
<Gold_Demona> The Super mechanic was a lot better in Sonic 3 & Knuckles
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Wirisme> I saw someone do a no damage run of Metropolis zone a while back. mind was blown
<Gold_Demona> Still the best Sonic game imo, Sonic 3 & Knuckles
<Wirisme> They fixed the transformation anyway
<Wirisme> with the double jump
<sonicandmario85> Amy:COME BACK HERE SONIC!! Sonic:AHH
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Gold_Demona> I can't stand Amy... >_>
<Wirisme> Time to play sonic CD methinks
<Gold_Demona> One-sided fangirl relationships drive me nuts.
<Jmo> Aww poor widdle Gold_Demona :P
<sonicandmario85> yes ive watched sonic X too
<Gold_Demona> Sonic X? Who's talking about Sonic X? Amy's ALWAYS like that.
*Jmo nomths Vivix
<sonicandmario85> sonic x is a show on 4kids it comes on saturdays on dont watch it on there anymore i watch it n hulu XD
<sonicandmario85> on*
<Wirisme> hmmm sonic 2 GG or sonic cd...
<Wirisme> btw game gear sonic 2 is hard as hell
<sonicandmario85> SONIC CD
*Vivix fondles Jmo
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Jmo> Is Steam down for anyone else ;~;
<sonicandmario85> Jmo:no
<Wirisme> :D
<killerpony7733> Yep
<Vivix> steam friends is down for me too Jmo
<Jmo> Huzzah for Steam quality.
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Probably maintenance or something regarding community update-
<sonicandmario85> refresh stream and it will come back
<Vivix> I just logged on steam
<sonicandmario85> oh i thought you meant the stream XD
<Jmo> Ah well
<Vivix> oh hehe
<Wirisme> ah I wish I had the JP soundtrack
<sonicandmario85> WHAT SOURCERY IS THIS
<sonicandmario85> wait is this sonic robo blast 2?
<MadSurge> And now, Nights!
<Gold_Demona> Oh, Nights
<sonicandmario85> SONIC ROBO BLAST 2 IS SIMILAR TO THIS well it has some of the same sound effects
<MaxTheBrony> This game looks insane o.o
<sonicandmario85> exept your walking in sonic robo blast 2 inside of zones
<Vivix> Jmo, entire community is down, so i guess there's an update
<Jmo> Fair enough
<sonicandmario85> has anyone played sonic robo blast 2? its a fan made 3d sonic game thats epic and its multiplayer :3
<Wirisme> can't say I have
<Gold_Demona> I've never heard of it
<XylemTube> Is this Nights into Dreams?
<XylemTube> sure looks like it
<Gold_Demona> XylemTube Yep
<XylemTube> cool
<XylemTube> BO
<sonicandmario85> Gold_Demona:go to srb2.org to download it
<sonicandmario85> Gold_Demona:then when the installer opens up select the place you wanna extract the game to
<Jmo> Huzzah, it returns~
<sonicandmario85> well call of duty doesnt look that bad just a regular first person shooter on steam

<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: PM the link?
<Wrek> 05Lil_B: link?
<Wrek> 05maybe i can design a pritn for them if they allow it
<Lil_B> I search the EQD Article
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Lil_B> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/truffleshuffle-european-officially.html
<Wrek> 05thakns
<Lil_B> the pic only shows 8 shirts but there are more on the link in the article
<Lil_B> half their MLP Shirts look like G1, honestly I don't even want to be disrespectful here
<Wrek> 05lets give them time
<Wrek> 05to expand their proper shirt pool
<Wrek> 05but right now im not too willing to buy from them
<MadSurge> Lil_B: oh noes! Only G1!
<Lil_B> right now It would be cheaper for me to ether import in Bulk from WeLoveFine or get a High-Rez Pic and walk to the next Print-Shop, but I hope they will get some newer designs
<Lil_B> MadSurge not only, and the actuall G4 Stuff looks kinda bland... and the colors on all the Shirts look so washed out
<Lil_B> man they are so retro... freaking She-Ra Shirts XD
<mentallyeffedguy> i just thought, before i went to church, to tell you people about some awesome fan made songs :)
<mentallyeffedguy> discord by the living tombstone and Avalanche by derpycrash and marblmuzik :)
<Lil_B> ok, I give the Site Credit, the way they have this retro Style is actually really awesome :)

<mentallyeffedguy> well i dont think youre missing anything inportant :P
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Hi! :)

<mentallyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome: chats very slow today
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Geh
<mentallyeffedguy> meh
<DashWithRainbows> Stupid random disconnect.
<AJIsAwesome> Heh
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, did we stop rhyming?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello SpadeMagnes[School]
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dont mind rhyming but I sort of found the constant rhyming on EQD to be annoying a bit
<Wrek> 05ugh
<Wrek> 05im gona need a while logner
<Wrek> 05in fact
<Wrek> 05ill tell you once the stream is up
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I was just joking around a bit. :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its fine..
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God my DS is old...
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I heard about th Zecora challenge. I'm not good at rhyming when it comes so speaking. :D
<AJIsAwesome> *to speaking*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> When did the Ds launch anyway?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: 2006?
<AJIsAwesome> Hold on a second.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I think I had mine since launch
<AJIsAwesome> Nintendo 21, 2004.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its falling apart, the mechanism that keeps the screen from moving and locked is broken
<AJIsAwesome> *November*
<AJIsAwesome> Dang it. :|
<SpadeMagnes[School]> pieces of the hull is missing
<Lil_B> maybe I should start focusing on actally finishing my songs -.- ... I have between 7 Songs WIP :/
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, I would've liked to have the original DS instead of the lite.
<mentallyeffedguy> SpadeMagnes[School]: mine is in prime condition, im giving it to my nephew :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I swear my 3DS was made poorly
<mentallyeffedguy> Lil_B: you make songs? have you made names for them yet?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I havent done anything to scratch it and theres a line on the screen that wont go away
<AJIsAwesome> Old one was MUCH more durable and could take a couple of falls. I dropped my DS lite one time and it broke in half. :|
<mentallyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome: i have both my gameboy and ds
<Lil_B> mentallyeffedguy I have Working titles for them, I usually decide the final name once they are done
<Derpy_at_work> bloop
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_at_work: Bloop.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At least my Gameboy Sp works fine :D
<Saturn> 08,01i keep dropping my phone this weekend
<Saturn> 08,01still intact
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Saturn! How's everything going? :)
<Lil_B> I love the Bass in the Song "F-F-F-Fire!" ... I generally love all songs in Mother 3 XD
<Lil_B> hia Saturn :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Saturn :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why did this not make it to outside Japan again?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Earthbound didn't sell well in other countries.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I hate sales dictate shit like that
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[School] Nintendo thought it wouldn't sell well like the previous game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You never know till you try damn it
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering the fact that RPGs didn't sell well in other countries like USA.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Um.. Final Fantasy?
<Lil_B> even that, thats why only 3 of the 6 FFs until FF7 were released in the US
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: They were almost close to releasing the first Mother game, but they scrapped it. :|
<Lil_B> they had everything ready, but it was too late in the NESs life
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well thats fair
<VenHur> Hey guys, I just puted my first paint spray on TF2.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I mean if its when the console is close to ending fair enough
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Hi! :)
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I really wish Earthbound sold more. I found a playable copy in a library store, but they said it wasn't for sale. :|
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello VenHur
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I played alot of Xenosaga last night
<SpadeMagnes[School]> AJIsAwesome: Then what good is it?
<Lil_B> but what I think was a douche move: the Eartzhbound Fans made a Gameboy compatible version of Mother 1 , they only released one Copy, there were no backups or anything, they send the Cartridge to Nintendo to shopw that a) there are Fans and b) that it's possible to Still release it... no answer whatsoever
<mentallyeffedguy> wrek has a funny woman voice :P
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: So they put it up on display and be dicks about it. :|
<Lil_B> mentallyeffedguy it's Slurrymoon XD
<VenHur> Oh hey, the show's starting.
<AJIsAwesome> *So they can*
<Wrek> 05ok hit refresh!
<AJIsAwesome> Seriously, ALL of the other games in the library were available for purchase, and the one game you deliberately DISPLAYED isn't for sale?! :|
<mentallyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome: trollolololol library :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What dicks
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My Ps2 makes alot of noise when it loads stuff
<Wrek> 05gusie
<Wrek> 05hit refresh

<AJIsAwesome> Chat, y u derp on me?
<Kandarihu> That's the time in Sweden, right?
<MadSurge> *hear
<SpadeMagnes[School]> FFFF my computer here says I need upgrade... wat
<Kandarihu> I guess it is
<VenHur> I have a PS3 Slim, and what I heard, it's less quieter then the original model.
<Wrek> 05aye Kandarihu
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: it's our timezone, yes
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fan inside the PS2 is loud for mine
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have to turn the sound up to drown it out
<Lil_B> in 2006 or 7 the earthbound Fans made a big Project to get MOTHER 3 to the US, they collected over 100.000 UNIQUE Signatures , they printed them together with Fanart and 2 Discs of Fanmusic to Nintendo of America, Nintendo of Japan and the Creator, Shigesato Itoi ... no answer
<AJIsAwesome> Weren't the early copies of the PS3 backwards compatible?
<AJIsAwesome> Was that you, Wrek?
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: yesh :D
<AJIsAwesome> I never heard your voice before. Sounds awesome. :O
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sadly I cant hear you because I dont want to get caught :(
<mentallyeffedguy> SpadeMagnes[School]: earplugs!!!

<SpadeMagnes[School]> They said there would be a thing with Mew on the site the 6th.. its not there
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe it's just hidden away.
<Wirisme> dat invisible ad
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They said it would be on the homepage
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe it's just hidden away.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> (／・ω・)／ Anyone there?
<tSparx> I'm dead.
<BladedWings> hi
<BladedWings> this guy...no self esteem
<Wirisme> this is kinda sad
<tSparx> this is kinda hamfisted
<tSparx> :P
<VenHur> This is kinda of an Oscar moment right here.
<Maid_RainBow1> i have to go everypony
<BladedWings> bye Maid_RainBow1
<Wirisme> take care Maid_RainBow1
<tSparx> Wrek is secretly a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

<BladedWings> (/^3^)/
<AJIsAwesome> My laptop depred. What happened to the guy in the room with the pistol?
<AJIsAwesome> *derped*
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Wrek saved his life
<BladedWings> AJIsAwesome: he didnt die
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Like a good agent
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Okay.
<Wirisme> yay
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Twilight Sparkle invades Farmville
<XylemTube> tHIS SONG
<BladedWings> best elevator every
<XylemTube> This song
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: What song is this?
<BladedWings> *ever
<XylemTube> yes i would also like to know what this osng is
<BladedWings> Putin on the Ritz
<XylemTube> BladedWings: thanks
<BladedWings> no prob, love this song :)
<AJIsAwesome> BladedWings: Thanks! :)
<tSparx> dat contrasting musick
<tSparx> dat random k I put behind music
<Vivix> the original ritz?
<Vivix> I love that song
<BladedWings> Vivix: yep
<Vivix> Woo
<Vivix> my bass just dropped
<Vivix> don't think I broke anything
<BladedWings> lol
<VenHur> Sorry I was gone, blackout happened. :S
<Vivix> I put it down to type, and woosh it went
<Applejack2012> lol
<BladedWings> wb VenHur
<Wirisme> dat ragtime
<Applejack2012> wb
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Welcome back! :)
<BladedWings> Jensen swag
<Barbetos|AtWork> Adam Jensens day off
<VenHur> Jensens got SWAG.
<Barbetos|AtWork> This reminds me of that video "Adam Jensen needs a new mirror"
<MirrorImage> how could you want a new me? =(
<MirrorImage> is the old me not good enough?
<MirrorImage> I CAN CHANGE!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Adam punched his mirror in the game btw.
<tSparx> MirrorImage: You're not the mirror, you're what's in it :$
*BladedWings hugs MirrorImage "i like you the way you are :) "
<Wirisme> must.. bob. head..
<MirrorImage> and by extension, i am it
*BladedWings bobs head "cant resist
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Which I guess means that you're the family's daughter! /Dr.WhoReference
<Barbetos|AtWork> And now when Adam comes around you hide.
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Nope, doesn't work that way. It's like saying that the monitor and what's being displayed on my monitor are the same thing.
*VenHur bobs head.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Don't want to get an augmented punch again.
<MirrorImage> tSparx - seeing as you can't have the Monitor's image without the Monitor itself
<tSparx> MirrorImage: But that doesn't make them the same thing. You can't have the heat of a fire without the flame itself, but those two aren't the same thing either.
<MirrorImage> but they are still part of the greater whole typically referred to as "flame"
<Sumica> 00,10morning all
<MirrorImage> mornin' Sumi
<Jmo> Mornin'
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Morning! :)
<MirrorImage> we gettin' all philosophical up in here
<VenHur> God, my head hurts after all that bobbing...
<BladedWings> morning Sumica
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodmorning Sumica
<tSparx> Sup Sumica :)
<VenHur> Fine greetings, Sumica.
<Sumica> 00,10oh no it's deus ex, that meens i cant watch
<MirrorImage> spoilers?
<tSparx> MirrorImage: But it still stands that the physical mirror and its reflection aren't the same. I can take another mirror and put it in the same spot to get the same reflection/image, but it's a different mirror.
<VenHur> Sumica: Man up, it's actually a good game and this song's catchy as hell.
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<MirrorImage> but it's still "a" mirror
<Sumica> 00,10I know it's a good game but I am still playing it
<MirrorImage> tSparx - this is just getting silly now.
<BladedWings> like i said, Jenson SWAG
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Nah it's not :) if you're annoyed we'll stop, but I *love* philosophical debates!
<VenHur> Sumica: Oh yeah...spoilers...sorry, carry on.
<VenHur> Jenson, the man that's party like the 90s.
<Sumica> 00,10I shall read the new chapter of through the eyes of another instead
<MirrorImage> Sumica - "new" chapter? I thought they were just revised chapters
<Sumica> 00,10he revises so much they might as well be new
<BladedWings> what?
<MirrorImage> >implying the chat thinks
<tSparx> I've no idea what you're asking about Wrek.
<BladedWings> same, i blanked out for a sec
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: I think.....:(
<tSparx> Wrek: I'm sure whatever you do will be good, but I like commentary on the "less serious" side of the spectrum :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> He take forever to revise those chapters. but I suppose he is busy writing a script for the cartoon that is being made.
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<tSparx> lawl
<Barbetos|AtWork> Not yet Wrek
<Barbetos|AtWork> But soon./
<VenHur> Lawl
<tSparx> Barbetos|AtWork: Oi, das spoilerz!
<Barbetos|AtWork> What?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I have not played this game before.
<Barbetos|AtWork> She dies!?
<Barbetos|AtWork> D=
<tSparx> Barbetos|AtWork: Oh, idk.
<tSparx> Barbetos|AtWork: When you said "but soon," I figured someone died.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh. I was kidding.
<tSparx> Barbetos|AtWork: Never played this either :P
<VenHur> Ooh, what to saa-ay.
<Barbetos|AtWork> But it looks like she is royally fucked, what with all that firepower he is dealing with.
<VenHur> HEADSHOT
<Barbetos|AtWork> Doing this part non lethal would suck I bet.
<tSparx> "Ooh whatcha say, oh that you only meant well? well of course you did -- ooh whatcha say, that it's all for the best? of course it is -- ooh whatcha say ooh that it's just a-what we need? you decided this -- ooh whatcha say, ooh what did she say?"
<Barbetos|AtWork> Kill the heavy machine gunners first wrek
<Barbetos|AtWork> It will buy you time I bet.
<tSparx> luff dat song
<Vivix> I like it, not the rapped over version though
<AJIsAwesome> So you can save her?
<VenHur> Kill the guy with the sandvich first, Wrek.
<Barbetos|AtWork> what did the five fingers say to the face?
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Oh, definitely not the rapped version. I hate that one.
<Pinkie6414> Hi, everypony
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, yeah- no offense to the rapper, but same here. But the original is such a brilliant use of vocoder- I love it
<BladedWings> hi Pinkie6414
<Barbetos|AtWork> Grenades?
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkie6414: Hi!:)
<MirrorImage> Wrek - grenades?
<tSparx> Hey Jmo
<Jmo> o.O
<Jmo> Haidar
<VenHur> Sup Jmo?
<Jmo> Nothing much.
<Barbetos|AtWork> bot!
<Barbetos|AtWork> oh shit!
<tSparx> Wrek is such a badass!
<BladedWings> yaay she lives!
<AJIsAwesome> Do you HAVE to save her?
<BladedWings> :D
<VenHur> She lives? SHE LIIIVES!
<VenHur> It's ALIIIVE!
<AJIsAwesome> Okay, thanks Wrek . :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am sure you could save her with non lethal.
<Barbetos|AtWork> but it would be hard
<MirrorImage> Barbetos|AtWork - before or after she became Swiss Cheese?
<VenHur> Wrek, that...was so kind of you, are you perhaps the true american hero?
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: If by american, you mean Sweden then yes. :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> A combo of stun nades, gas nades, and non lethal take downs could work too
<Sonny> I'm baaack
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Hi! :)
<BladedWings> hi Sonny
<Applejack2012> wb
<tSparx> wb Sonny :)
<VenHur> Hi Sonny.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Sonny
<Sonny> Hey AJisAwesome, Applejack2012, tSparx, Venhur and MLP_Brovakiin :D
<Sonny> I'm making my homework atm
<Sonny> I have a test tomorrow
<Sonny> and some math
<Pinkie6414> I'm guessing Wrek's hungry.
<VenHur> for a sandvich?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Sonny: Goodluck :D
<Maid_RainBow> geuss so
<Sonny> Oh don't worry, I had a 99% in math last exam
<Sonny> but I did my year over, but still
<Sonny> as for dutch, well let's say about 75%
<VenHur> Welcome back, Wrek.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well the security on this school computer is smarter than the last one...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Tried to play games on this... all games sites are now blocked
<Barbetos|AtWork> Delicious nectar of the gods, BEER!!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Cut in line
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At least Bronystate isnt blocked
<MirrorImage> and NO ONE bats an eye
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its a normal thing
<Barbetos|AtWork> in augmentation world!
<VenHur> And this is why you don't FUCK with [forget the guy's name] when he's cutting a line!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh my god JC a bomb
<Barbetos|AtWork> This subway reminds me of the first one
<Pinkie6414> I like it!
<Barbetos|AtWork> That has a place almost identical.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Adam Jensen "Fuck off Darrow."
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I love how we're disregarding what we're supposed to be doing and watching Bronystate instead..
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Life is good
<tSparx> Well I personally am not supposed to be doing anything else :)
<MirrorImage> i have work in a few minutes, and i haven't decided to try opening an IRC client while on the clock
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I'm supposed to be finishing my homework....:D
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: I just assume that every moment you're on BronyState you're supposed to be doing some homework :P
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: Y U NO sell stuff?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fuck Homework...
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: I'm getting my work done early so I have more time get ready for Brony Fun Fair. :P
<VenHur> +1 point for Wrek pulling a Simpsons refference.

<tSparx> Wirisme: Yeah, we've been talking for the last few minutes.
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Where abouts is it?
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: It's in Austin, Texas. To be honest, I had to search for brony conventions since no one tells me about them. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: oh ok :(
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: I actually signed up on a webiste for Brony meetups.
<Applejack2012> If only I knew about the fun fair PMV contest before
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: THat should help you. They told me about Brony Fun FAir.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Oh I heard about that one. Sadly, Austin is too far away from St. Louis for me to make the journey just yet.
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: what is it called? :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Man I love WoW
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: I'll link you it.
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Ok thank you :)

<tSparx> MadSurge: It's simple
<alexxm> how are things tSparx and MLP_Brovakiin
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Whats with the rediculace shades
<tSparx> MadSurge: Many people in a pool, one guy is "it," he closes his eyes and tries to tag someone else.
<BladedWings> leeeeerrrooooy jeeeenkkkiinnnns
<MLP_Brovakiin> alexxm: Good thanks, how about you?
<VenHur> Adam Jensen doesn't give a fuck with the shades, he thinks they're badass.
<tSparx> MadSurge: Everytime he calls out "marco," the rest of the players have to reply by calling out "polo."
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God I fucking hate Canary Mary
<tSparx> MadSurge: And that's how the guy who's "it" finds his victims :P
<Applejack2012> Doing good here too
<alexxm> MLP_Brovakiin well i'm back at college and i found out they had us come back on a day before everyone has a day off for the rest of the year
*Vordox goes lurk
<Pinkie6414> I just came back from playing Slender... I got all eight pages! But, Slender caught me...
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkie6414: The ending was awesome, right?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I heard he gets you regardless
<AJIsAwesome> *in sarcastic voice*
<VenHur> Advice to all peoples that played Slender. 1. DON'T PLAY THE GAME IN THE DARK WITHOUT THE LIGHTS ON.
<VenHur> You. have. been. warned...
<prince-dari> SpadeMagnes[School]: In the updated version he gets you, but you wake up and it's the day
<prince-dari> So you live
<Vordox> VenHur: Amnesia is better
<MLP_Brovakiin> alexxm: That sucks, it was also my first day back and it turns out it was thurday so I had engineering all day...
<Jmo> DABI PLS
<Pinkie6414> Oh, really?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> When ever I play Banjo Tooie I want to slap the person who made the Cloud Coockooland Canary Mary Jiggie
<prince-dari> JAYMOO PLS

<alexxm> MLP_Brovakiin basically i have every friday off now and they had us come back the day before our day off
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: Oh......that's MUCH better. Thank you. :)
<prince-dari> <3
<Kinixys> Oh! I haven't played this, yet. I probably should watch the stream XD
<Applejack2012> I thought Slender was a brandnew name
<Kinixys> shouldn't actually.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Rubberband AI is never fun
<MLP_Brovakiin> alexxm: What was the point of that? some schools can be so dumb
<AJIsAwesome> I thought you die no matter how many pages you collect. Glad they changed the ending so that you actually work for something.
<prince-dari> How have you not been killed by the wildlife yet jaymoo?
<VenHur> Slender's a fun game, I agree, but it's kind of...boring collecting all the pages.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How does slender even find you without a face?
<Jmo> caise
<Jmo> cause
<VenHur> Needs more taco demons in the game.
<Jmo> I'm a total bad-ass dabi/
<prince-dari> SpadeMagnes[School]: Echolocation?
<Jmo> y'know?
<MLP_Brovakiin> SpadeMagnes[School]: Sonar
<prince-dari> He bangs his drums
<alexxm> MLP_Brovakiin no idea i would have just had us come have us come back start of next week
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He has ears
<SpadeMagnes[School]> ?
<prince-dari> I dunno, maybe
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[School]: He's *Slenderman*, that's how he finds you.
<MLP_Brovakiin> SpadeMagnes[School]: My point still stands :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why does Slenderman want you dead anyways? Did we piss him off?
<prince-dari> Jmo: Do they teach you how to survive in school? :P
<Bronysith> oooh Wrek is playing his game of the year? awesomeness, Dick Jensen runthrough?
<Jmo> Pfft
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Lots of New Shirts Available at Welovefine

<prince-dari> SpadeMagnes[School]: He just wants his $20 ;_;7
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I think he just wants a hug, but the sight of him makes you die. :D
<Jmo> School needs to learn how to survive me, not the other way around.
<prince-dari> GIMME $20
<VenHur> I think we all know why's Slenderman is looking for us...he wants to give us the slab.

<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I LOVE SwordFighter X. So overpowered. :D
<Pinkie6414> What's happening?
<Bronysith> prince-dari: http://cheezburger.com/6563428096
<prince-dari> Lawl
<tSparx> Pinkie6414: Vis a vis what?
<AJIsAwesome> Just found out the Looney Tunes Show is getting new episodes in October.
<ThunderStrike> hi
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: My dad and I were expecting to hate it, but it's actually not too shabby :)
<tSparx> Heya ThunderStrike :)
<AJIsAwesome> ThunderStrike: Hi! :)
<VenHur> ...Panic Button Time, AJIsAwesome?
<ThunderStrike> hi tSparx and AJIsAwesome :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello ThunderStrike
<Pinkie6414> Hi, ThunderStrike! :)
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Same here. I think it's a pretty good sitcom based Looney Tunes. :)
<alexxm> how are things ThunderStrike
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Nope. I actually kind of like the show. :$
<VenHur> Well, I...don't like it...
<ThunderStrike> and hi to you too MLP_Brovakiin and Pinkie6414
<ThunderStrike> alexxm: allright, kind of bored. but nothing bad is up
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Well, you don't have to if you don't want to. Fine by me.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: What's most impressive is that my dad likes it too -- and he's been a Looney Toons fan since the 50's!
<BladedWings> sounds awesome to me Wreky
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ok :)
<VenHur> The classic Looney Tunes ARE classic, and nothing can top it....Tiny Toons Adventures is also fine with me.
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Nice.
<Sonny> I'm here to inform you guys that for some freaking reason all of a sudden my laptop shut down and said somthing about ethernet thingy and IT WONT START UP
<Sonny> :(
<VenHur> And Animaniacs...and etc.
<tSparx> VenHur: Oh, true dat, nothing tops the classical LT
<Sonny> and this computer sucks so hard
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: True, very true, but for a sitcom Looney Tunes it's not that bad.
<alexxm> VenHur all of stephen speliburgs cartoons from the 90's were some of the best cartoons of all time
<tSparx> Well, *except*... *maybe* the animaniacs.
<tSparx> Hey twilight_sprinkle :)
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: You don't like the Animaniacs?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello twilight_sprinkle :)
<tSparx> Hey Dumorimasoddaa :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Dumorimasoddaa: Hi! :)
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: No, I'm saying that I might like it more than classic LT :3
<alexxm> hey Dumorimasoddaa
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Oh. Okay. :$
<Sonny> It's nice to see that nobody cares, I'll be going now
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Hi! :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: I care...:(
<twilight_sprinkle> hai tSparx MLP_Brovakiin and AJIsAwesome :)
<Applejack2012> I loved Animaniacs
<VenHur> God FUCKING Bless Stephen Spielburg. Too bad we might never see another cartoon from that BRILLIANT man...
<Applejack2012> Pinkie and the Twilight
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Yeah.........:(
<tSparx> Sonny: I didn't see what you said, sorry to hear it :/
<twilight_sprinkle> and Applejack 2012 hi
<Sonny> it's just that I'm so pissed right now, I hate when my laptop wont even start
<AJIsAwesome> Pinkie and Freakazoid would be best friends. :D
<Sonny> I'm gonna try and fix it so I'll be back later
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Is it overheating?
<tSparx> Applejack2012: My dream show <3
<VenHur> Pinkie, Pinky, and The Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, BRAIN! [narf!]
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: See you later. :)
<Sonny> no my laptop has some kind of ethernet problem
<Sonny> :(
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Pinkie, DeadPool, and Freakazoid chilling out :)
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Oh. Maybe you should try again later.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Sonny
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Best crossover ever. :D
<Sonny> idk he just wont start because he keeps complaining about this right boot device
<Sonny> and somthing with ethernet
<Sonny> I'll (hopefully) figure it out
<Sonny> cya
<tSparx> bye bye Sonny
<MadSurge> tSparx: oh god all of my yes :D
<Bronysith> Wrek: i love your rage
<tSparx> Wrek, remember what my mother used to say: it's not a game anymore if you're not having fun :3
<Wirisme> games are serious business
<Applejack2012> bye
<MLP_Brovakiin> I love your reaction "I am slightly aggrivated" :D
<tSparx> Wirisme: They are also made for funz
<AJIsAwesome> Wirisme: And for lulz.
<Wirisme> :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> *aggravated
<tSparx> Wirisme: AJIsAwesome and for the gamer community :)
<Applejack2012> ;)
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: That too.
<tSparx> Alright, I'm probably gonna stay until Wrek's done, and then take off.
<tSparx> I have lunch to grab :P
<Wirisme> it's nearly time for dinner
<Cypresswolf> My brother Mike wont stay at BFF for long - he's not real big into the brony fandom, :) an anime con he can do, I think I'm wearing him down :P
<Wirisme> Which is good because I'm hungry
<MLP_Brovakiin> I have my dinner now :) brb
<tSparx> Wirisme: Are you a Briton?
<Wirisme> I am
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Bye!:)
<tSparx> Wirisme: I am five hours behind you :$
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Maybe he could go somewhere and have some fun.
<Applejack2012> nye
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: My family's going to find someplace to golf.
<tSparx> ;brb
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Or something like that. :D
<Cypresswolf> I think when he sees the vast age range, he may stay a bit longer than planned :)
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: That would be great. :)
<Applejack2012> bye
<Cypresswolf> I'm trying to coax him into doing the drinking ponies panel with me
<killerpony7733> Wrek awesome quote inc
<Cypresswolf> I need someone to help keep me awake :)
*MLP_Brovakiin has returned with lasagna :)
*Bronysith puts raisins in MLP_Brovakiin s lasagna
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Yeah. I'm going to try and find some energy drinks. :D
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, deus ex

<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome: hi
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bronysith: Why would you do such a thing? :(
<Applejack2012> RD energy drink :D
*GabeMoist waltzes into Bronystate
<Applejack2012> hi
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: It is :)
<GabeMoist> Ohai
<alexxm> how are things GabeMoist
<Cypresswolf> Im bringing coffee with me - planned coffee breaks throughout saturday & a nap (prior to coffee of course)
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack2012: I'm thinking of getting some. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello GabeMoist
<AJIsAwesome> GabeMoist: Hi! :)
<Applejack2012> hio
<Applejack2012> hi
<GabeMoist> alexxm school is attacking mah brain
<AJIsAwesome> I'm considering taking naps, but I always hated them as a kid. :D
<Dark_Horst> that phase?
<Cypresswolf> I cant make it through the day without one, sleep late on weekends, sleep as soon as I get home from work
<Wirisme> I can't nap for some reason it's full blown sleep or nothing
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: If I take naps I can't get to sleep later on :/
<Cypresswolf> on that note, staying awake from 2 am wasnt such a good idea
<Dark_Horst> now i find myself wanting to play human revolution again. which is a problem, since i'm busy playing the first deus ex. for science
<AJIsAwesome> For some reason when I take naps, I feel like I wasted time and I'm sad for the rest of the day.
<Wirisme> I wish I didn't have to sleep at all actually
<Wirisme> think of the extra time!
<AJIsAwesome> I'm fine with sleeping but not napping.
<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome: i know that feel
<Cypresswolf> If I could go through life without sleep, that would be awesome :) I'd start by spending nights in the bar swapping stories
<MLP_Brovakiin> If I am not doing anything and I am don't want to sleep, I usually spend my day on bronystate or on xbox :P
<AJIsAwesome> I can't wake up after 9 AM feeling like my entire day is ruined. :D
<tSparx|Away> Wirisme: I couldn't not dream
<MLP_Brovakiin> *and I
<tSparx|Away> AJIsAwesome: HAHAHAAHAHA, man, there were days this summer when I went to *bed* at 9am xD
<AJIsAwesome> I always wake up before 9. I hate waking up after 9. :D
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx|Away: :D
<tSparx> My name was innacurate, now it's fixed :3
<tSparx> Wrek: I'm listening!

<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: Cool. Does he talk much?

<Everlasting_Joy> Hi Joy!
<AJIsAwesome> Joy: Hi! :)
<SafariMonkey> Wrek, I'm still interested to know wether there is any significance to the armor inscription/embossing, or wether it's just old style art
<Wrek> 05SafariMonkey: all the runes spell out actual words
<Wrek> 05its thats what you're saying
<Applejack2012> Good evening
<KnifeH> I shall go inside. If I disconnect, consider me having dropped my laptop

<AJIsAwesome> Joy: Are you playing the updated version?
<Bronysith> i want some hot tea and jaw droppingly large strawberry desserts
<Joy> AJIsAwesome: Yep
<Everlasting_Joy> So many message places to keep track of!
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: In english (rune style letters) or in another language? If not english, would you like to tell ud what they say? If it's english, I must just be bad at reading. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Joy: Okay.
<SafariMonkey> *us
<mentallyeffedguy> hey guys! wanna hear something funny?
<MLP_Brovakiin> mentallyeffedguy: Sure
<AJIsAwesome> mentallyeffedguy: Depends. Is is offensive?
<mentallyeffedguy> we didint need to go to church today! i fucked up"
<KnifeH> .. I almost dropped it.
<MLP_Brovakiin> why?
<KnifeH> That should teach me form carrying 10 things at a time
<KnifeH> from**
<Cynder7> 6:3
<KnifeH> Especially if it's a sum of 2800 dollars.
<KnifeH> I blame the beer.
<mentallyeffedguy> nobody told me church was only 2 times in the month :(
<SafariMonkey> KnifeH: The normal expression is that should/will teach me *to* X
<mentallyeffedguy> when i grow up, im gonna be an awesome viking pony
<KnifeH> No need to correct someone who's drunk a beer.
<KnifeH> :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Freaking Pokemon site...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Almost 1Pm and still no "Mew Prize Pack"
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: Mew prize pack?
<SafariMonkey> SpadeMagnes[R]: Pokemon are dangerous when they freak...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Mew won this bracket so it was gonna have a prize pack on the six of september

<KnifeH> box = bock
<KnifeH> ..
<KnifeH> book!
<KnifeH> What is wrong with me today.
<Wrek> 05i dunno
<Wrek> 05oh btw
<mentallyeffedguy> wonder if wrek got inspired from the Arn films last night :P
<Wrek> 05what was your art request?
<Wrek> 05for the trade
<KnifeH> I never gave one :p
<SafariMonkey> KnifeH: Beer probably.
<Wrek> 05and mentallyeffedguy: i drew this before the movies
<KnifeH> But it must have Scootaloo
<Sumica> 00,10this picture cam before he showed the films
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: i know, but did it inspire you further, if you know what i mean
<KnifeH> Erm.. I don't think it's the beer. I only had one.
<SafariMonkey> KnifeH: Well if *one* beer has you typing like that...
<Sumica> 00,10not sure but I just cant see em keeping that long of a tail wrek.
<KnifeH> I think it's the anger, frustration, rage and sadness doing it.
<Cades> lol my crush from grade 6 is here haha
<KnifeH> A combination of epic... stupidity.
<Cades> a really fun thing to do at school is point at the ground at someones feet and its gaurunteed they will look
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: Scandanavians are known for having long hair.
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: Yeah, that length of tail done like that would be a major liability in close combat...
<Cynder7> 6xDD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Gah
<KnifeH> The tail is there for backup.
<KnifeH> Whipping
<Sumica> 00,10Not saying long is bad, but draging on the ground behind ling might be too much
<SafariMonkey> Unless of course they have good tail control like AppleJack but I thought that was earth pony magic...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My computer is lagging so bad...
<KnifeH> I should stream tonight.
<KnifeH> Now that I think about it.
<ScottishUnicorn> Heyo
<EleanorAwesome> Wait whoa

<Applejack2012> Hugs Scoota
<KnifeH> Wrek: You know.. books are very good for making things.. *ahem* suggestive.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I wish I have Starforce 1 Pegasus and Dragon, I only have Leo
<Wrek> 05aaaw KnifeH, but i was thinking of streamign your request here now

<Sonny> Hey guys...
<CCCP> Hi GilDash
<CCCP> *hugs GilDash*
<CCCP> hello Sonny and Sumica
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy GilDash, Sonny!
<AJIsAwesome> GilDash: Hi! :)
<Ravebrony> Hey Sonny and GilDash :)
<Sonny> I just found out that my laptop randomly stopped working
<Vivix> Sumica, was it you who fell asleep and gave us a black screen for a while once?
<Vivix> We sat around pinging you or something-
<Sonny> And It's unfixable
<Sumica> 00,10poasably
<Sonny> ...
<BladedWings> hi GilDash
<Vivix> We played sounboard
<Everlasting_Joy> Sonny: So new computer?
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Maybe you should try to get your old files back.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello GilDash
<Sonny> Ye I'll need to buy one...
<Jmo> Oh damn KnifeH, 7/8 then caught.
<Sumica> 00,10some times i set up a playlist and leave it running for you all when i know there wont be any one on for some time
<Sonny> Can't acces them
<Jmo> I lol'd
<KnifeH> Jmo: I got them all
<CCCP> I skipped the last hour of school today hope the techers dont know...
<Vivix> Ah yeah
<KnifeH> Watch the end
<Jmo> Yea still watching ;P
<MadSurge> Why hello there GilDash!
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Hey there, Shizuka!
<CCCP> hi Kandarihu|OldComp and Shizuka
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<Sonny> So basicly my laptop just broke with no reason at all and I need to buy a new computer now urgh...
<Sonny> but anyway
<Sonny> Since I still have a computer left I'll just go on this one
<Sonny> So let's do this again, hey everypony :)!
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: Sorry to hear that. No computer is truly unfixable, sometimes you just hyave to replace every component, and that is more expensive than a new laptop :P What went wrong?
<CCCP> hi Sonny
<Sonny> I don't know, I started my laptop as always and went to get somthing to drink
<SafariMonkey> Hello Sonny
<Amber> HOLY!
<KnifeH> I approve of drunk scootsw
<KnifeH> scoots**
<Sonny> afther that it said somthing about ethernet v. 2.0.3 blabla etc etc insert boot device
<Sonny> or somthing
<MadSurge> Poor Scoots :(
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Well, my mom's taking her laptop to the hospital to teach a client. This time, I taught her how to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots, and she took notes. So there might be two Kandarihus here, even though |OldComp will be me.
<Sonny> And now it wont start
<Amber> I unlocked Daytime Mode!
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu|OldComp: Okay.
<KnifeH> I made Wrek draw Scootaloo. Now I can sleep tonight
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: Why do you say unfixable?
<Sonny> Because I researched it and they say my hard disc broke when that message is displayed
<Sonny> so yeah
<Jmo> LOL
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: Just replace your HDD then.
<mentallyeffedguy> https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GUWRP1nRO38/UEUGkDDIbwI/AAAAAAAAFDE/nvrY6uatW74/s1600/WizardRidingaUnicornonaRainbowinSpace.png i will not rest before everyone has seen nyan mlp
<Sonny> The problem is I know somthing of computer but not of hardware
<Sonny> I have no idea what HDD is
<Sumica> 00,10zomg scootabuse =p
<MLP_Brovakiin> Sonny: Hard Disc Drive
<alexxm> drunk scootaloo?
<Sonny> I'll try that later but now I'm stuck with school
<Jmo> Dat 8/8
<Amber> :)
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: If it's really old, sure buy a new one if you want to and can afford to, but a broken hdd isn't the end of a computer's life if you don't want it to be.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> mentallyeffedguy, I was half expecting that to be a ponification of Ranka Lee's Nyan Nyan song.
*Bronysith puts Sumica in a full nelson
<Sonny> I have it for about a year and a bit now my laptop
<Sonny> but still
<Jmo> Dem reactions KnifeH. Heh.
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: then it's still quite new
<Sonny> I know right!?
<CCCP> Whats the worst fandom ever?
<Sonny> I'll just let them repair it again, but I'll stationise it now
<Bronysith> CCCP: sonic fans
<KnifeH> Jmo: what reactions?
<Sonny> So it can't break
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: :D
<Sonny> and once again... all my files will be gone
<Jmo> KnifeH: Your Slender reactions broski.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> CCCP, I'd think Twilight fans.
<Sonny> I just started making fan art -.-
<KnifeH> Jmo: Oh, yeah XD
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: True.
<Jmo> Too funny
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: mine's 1 and 2/3 and I still consider it quite new
<CCCP> Bronysith but sonic fans are just furries
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I'm a Sonic fan and I agree with that. :D
<KnifeH> I got speedpaints if you want to see them
<Jmo> I am intrigued.
<Bronysith> CCCP: wow, wow, that is just evil
<KnifeH> Same channel
<Wirisme> I'm a sonic fan to the extent that I play some of the games on occasion
<Bronysith> CCCP: not all sonic fans are furries, they are just terrible fans
<Jmo> Brb digging through your channel till the end of timeee~
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: I'm not a furry. Don't generalize.
<KnifeH> Jmo: Watch the one called "Scootaloo's dream"
<CCCP> Bronysith what makes them so terrible?
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome sorry
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: No problem.
<Sonny> Safarimonkey I just started making music
<Bronysith> CCCP: they are fans of a dead franchise
<Sonny> I actually made a song
<Sonny> to put on youtube
<AJIsAwesome> In my opinion, Sonic fans complain and whine too much.
<CCCP> Bronysith im a fan of dead franchises too :s
<CCCP> just not of Sonic
<Sonny> I'll just get a pc
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: Yeah?
<KnifeH> brb 4 hours. Toilet
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: Didn't you have a PC?
<Bronysith> sonic games just are now shit
<Jmo> glhf KnifeH.
<KnifeH> Jmo: Always
<Sonny> Ye it was called Confused, it was about Pinkie Pie's mental break down
<KnifeH> Jmo: Did you find the video I mentioned?
<Sonny> I made a pic with it, lol
<CCCP> Bronysith does SSBB count as a sonic game?
<Jmo> Yeah I'm 2 minutes in now KnifeH
<Bronysith> CCCP: really? fucking really?
<KnifeH> Jmo: Sweet beans
<Sonny> I mean I DID, but now it just, Poof vanished
<Sonny> great
<Bronysith> CCCP: wow, that is the most retarded question i have ever read
<Bronysith> EVER
<CCCP> Bronysith lol
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: sorry I lost my message to the up arrow
<CCCP> Bronysith it was a joke
<Bronysith> CCCP: no it wasnt
<KnifeH> Jmo: PS: It's better with music on ;3
<KnifeH> Jmo: really sets the mood
<CCCP> Bronysith yeah it was
<Bronysith> CCCP: you just realized your stupidity and tried to take it back
<Sonny> Basicly I made a video much alike one I saw on youtube called "thelivingtombstone" or somthing and it inspired me together with other fan art and music such as Wrek
<tSparx> Holy scheiss that looks adorable <3
<Jmo> KnifeH: Got my speakers playing the music with it, tis all geewdd.
<Wirisme> :)
<Sonny> And now I can't accces it anymore since it was saved on my computer
<tSparx> I'm guessing I'm still watching Wrek, but art!Wrek?
<tSparx> Sonny: Glad to see that you're back, Sonny, you get your comp straightened out?
<CCCP> Bronysith you must be pretty stupid if you thought i wasnt joking
<Sonny> No tSparx
<Sonny> It broke
<Sonny> I lost all of my work
<Wrek> 05hmm
<tSparx> Sonny: D:
<Sonny> ALL of it
<Sonny> :(
<tSparx> Sonny: I'm so sorry! That's *awful* :(
<Sonny> i know :'(
<Bronysith> CCCP: well you didnt show any sort of emote face to say you were joking, also there are alot of false gamers out there that make these stupid questions that are dead serious
<CCCP> sorry
<Lyra`> hey there wrek
<Sonny> But I'll get a pc now so it wont brake because of damage
<Sonny> or so I hope
<CCCP> i like using emots for serious things
<Sonny> anyway, is that Scootaloo?
<tSparx> Bronysith: CCCP I find it almost impossible to joke on the Internet without using some silly emote, 'cause otherwise no one can hear you inflection over the text :P
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: the Hard Disk drive contains all the information on the computer, so all of your files and programs will be lost, unless you backed up recently. (programs can be reinstalled) However, if you get a new HDD your computer should be fine, except that. *Please* tell me you backed up recently!
<Vivix> I always feel super awkward using emotes, so I never do
<Bronysith> tSparx: thank you
<KnifeH> I like this drunk scoots
<tSparx> This also leads to the worrying problem that I also use :P when I'm being serious sometimes too :)
<CCCP> tSparx but the joke is i wanna see someones reaction, basically i was trolling. poorly
<pony13598> hai wrek
<Wrek> 05hi Lyra`
<tSparx> I didn't hear CCCP's joke, but I've been in his shoes before, I understand how that goes :)
<Bronysith> CCCP: those with thin skin should not troll
<Wrek> 05so far KnifeH?
<pony13598> <3
<Sonny> Safarimonkey, ...
<Sonny> I didn't
<Sonny> that's the thing
<Klumzeedragon> Heya Wrek. :) Howd your meeting go?
<Sonny> I made it yesterday because I was so inspired
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: D:
<CCCP> Bronysith im stupid please explain what that means?
<KnifeH> Wrek: it looks all gewd. I like the position, most definitely :D
<Wrek> 05jsut fine Klumzeedragon
<Sonny> Now my internet is slowed down because I reached limit, My laptop broke and I lost all of my work
<Klumzeedragon> Good to hear! And hello hello everypony else. :)
<KnifeH> Wrek: Try and make the mouth like.. droolish.. Remember, tongue out
<Sonny> BUT, the good news is that I will go to my dads place sunday and he HAS a good computer :D
<SafariMonkey> Sonny: Well I hope I at least spared you the expense of a complete new laptop.
<Sonny> thank you SafariMonkey
<CCCP> hi Klumzeedragon
<BladedWings> yay this song!
<Klumzeedragon> Is that an adorable Berry Punch I spy? :P And hows it going CCCP?
<Sonny> Not sure if Scootaloo has a tail or not :p
<Everlasting_Joy> Klumzeedragon: This is Scoot.
<alexxm> good song
<Bronysith> CCCP: thin skin, easily disturbed, opposite of thick skinned which people with thick skin are not easily phased by insults
<Sonny> oh there we go
<AJIsAwesome> Klumzeedragon: Hi! :)
<BladedWings> hi Klumzeedragon
<Sonny> my god my internet sucks
<Sonny> :p
<AJIsAwesome> Klumzeedragon: Scootaloo.
<Sonny> Hey Klumzeedragon

<SafariMonkey> hi Klumzeedragon
<Klumzeedragon> Everlasting_Joy: Ah. I kind of thought so, but the bottle threw me off. :D
<CCCP> Bronysith okies :c
*tSparx refuses to say hi to Klumzeedragon
<tSparx> Wait, damnit :P
<Sonny> She just HAD to take a drink of that cider :D
<Sonny> tsparx: :o
<SafariMonkey> Did I miss Doctor Who, guys?
<Klumzeedragon> Wow. :P How is everypony?
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: I don't think so, no.
<Wirisme> Nope
<SafariMonkey> Yay!
*Klumzeedragon hugs tSparx ;) You know you want to say hiiiii.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: MLP Royal Engagement Party in London
<Amber> Hi, Klumzeedragon!
<Sonny> Klumzeedragon: I lost all my hard work, my laptop, and my fast internet, bisides that I feel fine
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: It's been Wrek since 9am (GMT-5) (it's 13:40 GMT-5 now) :P
*tSparx hugs Klumzeedragon back :)
<SafariMonkey> Hello Klumzeedragon I don't know you. Would you like to remedy that problem for me?
<Jmo> That was amazing KnifeH.
<Klumzeedragon> alexxm: I'm good. :) Barely woke up. Took some trash out and cleaned out a rat trap... :S
<KnifeH> Jmo: Glad you liked it :3
<Klumzeedragon> Sonny: Aw. Sorry to hear about that. Hopefully things start looking up. :)
<Sonny> thank you drag :)
<KnifeH> Jmo: I had another one but it got banned by YouTube
<Jmo> orlynao?
<CCCP> dat underage drinking
<KnifeH> Jmo: Yes. They considered it sexual. It was just a follow up speedpaint.
<KnifeH> I'll get the link if you want
<KnifeH> To the pic
*Klumzeedragon shakes SafariMonkey hoof. :P Pleased to meet you!
<Jmo> Sure, send it my way via PM.
<Everlasting_Joy> And then Scootaloo woke up in an alley somewhere in Canterlot. She started drinking in Ponyville.
<Jmo> That piece, are you serious?
*SafariMonkey shakes hoof of Klumzeedragon. Very nice to meet you too!
<KnifeH> Yes
<Jmo> God Youtube is ridiclious.
<CCCP> Jmo what do you mean?
<Everlasting_Joy> I've got a class to go to, so I must take off folks. Take care!
<KnifeH> Jmo: I even appealed to it, linking the pic and everything
<Sonny> The site Wrek uploads his work is devionart right?
<Everlasting_Joy> Sonny: DeviantArt.
<tSparx> Sonny: deviantart
<Sonny> thanks
<Jmo> KnifeH: That really is rubbish.
<Klumzeedragon> Jmo: It's not youtube really, its usually because people flag it. And once something gets flagged enough it does what it did dun dooed.
<AJIsAwesome> Everlasting_Joy: Bye! :)
<KnifeH> Jmo: I know.
<tSparx> Sonny: Specifically, Wrekys is the name he goes by on there :)
<KnifeH> Jmo: I will reappeal
<Jmo> Youtube community is even worst.
<Sonny> I know ^^
<CCCP> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Sonny> just since my laptops broke I don't have the link
<KnifeH> Jmo: They guy who judged is a brony hater XD. That's for sure
<Jmo> Huzzah for reappeal~
<Jmo> Fosho.
<Wirisme> that system is absolutely retarded, it's like the spam flagging
<KnifeH> Jmo: I could just reupload it.
<SafariMonkey> KnifeH: What is the image in question?
<KnifeH> Jmo: But it'd rather not risk my other vids to be removed
<KnifeH> I shall link, if I may
<Jmo> KnifeH: That's completely understandable.
<tSparx> "Oooooh, something ain't right." <3
<Wrek> 05KnifeH: btw jsut cleanign the lines up atm
<KnifeH> Wrek: I knows :3
<tSparx> KnifeH: Always feel free to link to images during the stream, ask a mod for anything else :P
<KnifeH> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/211/3/d/i_didn__t_catch_you___i__m_sorry_____speedpaint__by_knifeh-d597b0t.jpg
<KnifeH> This was considered sexual and nudity
<KnifeH> There, done
<KnifeH> :p
<Wirisme> nope not seeing it
<tSparx> KnifeH: I'm confused about what's going on there, but it's very well-drawn and expressive :)
<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: I thought youtube admins were smarter than that.
<Klumzeedragon> :D Ponies are always naked?
<tSparx> And obviously not inappropriate :)
<KnifeH> AJIsAwesome: Still people with opinions.
<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: I think it's a fantastic piece of art.
<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: True.
<Sonny> haha Klumzeedragon xp
<Wirisme> yeah that's really good
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<MadSurge> That needs MUCH fantasy to see any nude/sexual content
<tSparx> Klumzeedragon: Bronies are the only fanbase whose characters are made more sexy by the *addition* of clothes :P
<KnifeH> AJIsAwesome: Well, you need to watch my previous speedpaint to know what's going on, duh :D
<Lil_B> are we talking about Art?
<Sonny> lol
<MadSurge> Hello again Lil_B! :)
<CCCP> hi Lil_B
<mentallyeffedguy> i dont think ponies should be considered sexy
<CCCP> ^
<Klumzeedragon> Lil_B: Hows it going? :) And yeah. KnifeH drew something and linked us.
<Sonny> touché
*Lil_B hugs MadSurge CCCP and Klumzeedragon
<Sonny> I think ponies should be considered cute :p
<Lil_B> Klumzeedragon was it well drawn?
<CCCP> Sonny same
<Klumzeedragon> Lil_B: Extrememly. :)
<Lil_B> Klumzeedragon can you pm me the link?
<tSparx> mentallyeffedguy: I don't find the ponies sexy, but some peeps do, and it's a big tent :)
<Klumzeedragon> There you are. :)
<Spectrum_Rush> remember naked ponies are cute and innocent dressed ponies well http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0oitfCcft1rny1evo1_500.png
<Sonny> lol
<MadSurge> tSparx: Ikr? Although "sexy" is a stretch :D
<Sonny> haha :D
<Klumzeedragon> Spectrum_Rush: Roseluck is always adorable. :P
<CCCP> Derpy is cute...
<Bronysith> sexy is good
<Sonny> CCCP: agree^
<Amber> :)
<Klumzeedragon> KnifeH: So what is going on in your art? Scoots caught Rainbow Dash and feels bad about it? Or hurt her when she caugt her?
<Lil_B> when I would call a Pony "sexy" i would probably mean it like "charmful and beautiful" for the sake of beeing Charmful and beautiful, like Flur-De Lis
<AJIsAwesome> I'm npt really into the whole sock thing IMO, but the cutest picture I've seen of socks is Pinkie with a head sock. :D
<AJIsAwesome> *not*
<mentallyeffedguy> beautiful is the right word :)
<CCCP> i thin kmost eople call ponies sexy as a joke
<Ravebrony> Dat CM
<Vivix> Maybe, maybe not
<Sonny> well I guess every femine character on the internet will experience the wrath of rule 34
<BladedWings> YEEEES! Ra Ra Rasputin!
<Lil_B> KnifeH I just saw your Picture, looks amazing
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: True, but there are some who don't
<KnifeH> Klumzeedragon: Go to my YouTube and watch "Scootaloo's dream" and read the description. YouTube is KnifeH
<Sonny> boozaloo?
<Sonny> :D
<AJIsAwesome> DAT BOOZE CUTIEMARK :D
<SirGanjalf> Scootabooze
<KnifeH> It explains more than I could say right now
<Klumzeedragon> KnifeH: Alrighty. :)
<Vivix> Scootabooze is scootabuse ;__;
<SirGanjalf> Is that a form of Scootabuse?
<Vivix> ^
<SirGanjalf> Dammit, ninja'd
<KnifeH> Scoot's cutiemark, a booze bottle.
<AJIsAwesome> SirGanjalf: No. It's a play-on word of scootabuse.
<KnifeH> Oh dear
<Sonny> mother of god... Vinix you're right
<Sonny> °-°
<Sonny> O_O
<Vivix> hehe
<Sonny> dramatic zoom
<Lil_B> Well, a lot of actual "Cloppers" just remain silent about it, many people who r34 them just do it for the lulz
<Sonny> lol
<Ravebrony> =_(\
<Sonny> >.>
<KnifeH> I hate scootabuse
<Vivix> Loud R34 ruin it for many people
<tSparx> As my dad always says, "Turn to any page on the Sears catalogue, everything on that page, there's someone out there who wants to fuck at least somethign on there." Haha, it's a *very* big tent :P
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should drop this discussion, this really isn't the place for this kind of stuff.
<KnifeH> So I drew it.. well.. trying to make sense out of it
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome im arilright if some one does that but it really does seem like an unavoidable part of the fandom, i mean like i find it hard to go on some really awesome sites that every other pic is r34 and its annoying.
<Amber> I'm back!
<KnifeH> Alrighty.
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Agreed.
<CCCP> hi Amber
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: It's really hard to find some simple innocent pics with something like that popping up.
<Bronysith> oh boy are we bitching about cloppers?
<Vivix> Noones bitching, per se
<Sonny> As long as there no adult action I think it can be considered cute (as in love)
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome ikr
<Bronysith> Sonny: it is just sex, there is nothing wrong with love and sex
<Brad[Laptop]> I just like normal art and pics. Dont see why we gotta sexualize it :P
<Lil_B> Bronysith more like just talking :/
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should drop the discussion before this gets out of hand........
<Vivix> Yeah
<Sonny> AAAAAANNYYYYWAAAAYYY
<Sonny> nice pic Wrek
<Sonny> :)
<Spectrum_Rush> i wonder why was this face not exploited or used http://derpiboo.ru/76451

*Vivix is uncomfortable with alcohol
<KnifeH> I was bored XD
<Lil_B> Brad[Laptop] really, a lot of people draw it just for the heck of it XD
<Wirisme> dat prokofiev
<ScottishUnicorn> yeah pretty much
<Brad[Laptop]> Lil_B I wish I could draw half as good as many of the artists out there :P
<ScottishUnicorn> or it's a commision
<tSparx> "Love and tolerance." Period :)
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: I never saw that face before. :D
<SirGanjalf> Applebloom gusta
<Vivix> ^
*Sonny prince-dari: gives awkward hug
<CCCP> Lil_B it makes no sense why you would draw it for the heck of it though..
<KnifeH> Wrek: what are you doing? I must now backhand you with my hoof for you abusing the tablet.
<Bronysith> KnifeH: ponies dont have hands...
<Vivix> CCCP, why not? Many of my friends draw and write the most perverted things for the lulz. Like a female friend I had wanted to write yaoi about two overweight truckdrivers-
<Bronysith> so therefore you cannot backhand KnifeH
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: nice speed paint! i liked it :)
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: ........................
<Vivix> It's her humour-
<Spectrum_Rush> AJIsAwesome: ita from hearts and hooves day, when the cmc are in the bushes watching Bic Mac and Cheerilee
<ScottishUnicorn> Vivix: lol
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: :D
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Okay. I'm just saying this isn't the place to drop that kind of bomb here. :D
<CCCP> Vivix lolwut
<Vivix> Nono, sorry hehe
<KnifeH> Hmmm
<Sonny> Urgh
<KnifeH> I got 1 more subscriber until I'm 200
<CCCP> shotas better than yaoi anyway.. >.>
<KnifeH> Whoever gets it gets a free pic
<Bronysith> MY PHLEGM IS GONE WOOT
<Sonny> I was My little pony was strict lecture that you need to see :p
<Bronysith> KnifeH: ill be your 200
<Jmo> You sonova KnifeH.
<Bronysith> give me a link KnifeH
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: okay.
<Lil_B> CCCP when an artist does something, he doesn't need a reason to do it, they did it because theythought it would be a funny Idea, the really is all the reason they need
<ScottishUnicorn> Anyone play Dota 2?
<Jmo> Had to be 199th. /flipstable
<Sonny> So I want be treated like an alien when I start a conversation about it
<Sonny> ...
<KnifeH> Still on 200
<Vivix> CCCP, o u shotatiger
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: you are one sub from 200?
<KnifeH> Could be the youtube refresh rate of epic slowness
<CCCP> Lil_B yeah but the idea of sexualizing it isnt funny anymore
<KnifeH> If someone gets it, take a screenshot and note it to me
<Sonny> :L
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: Yes. I got 10000 watchers in general if you count other sites XD. I just started my youtube a few months ago
<Sonny> KnifeH what kind of videos do you make?
<Lil_B> CCCP for you, different people, different opinions, my opinion is that too much dubstep remixes of a song is just too much, does that stop people from continuing to make remixes of it?
<Sonny> nope
<KnifeH> Sorry, had to refresh page. Might have lost some comments
<KnifeH> and Pms
<Sonny> h
<killerpony7733> Wrek Volbeat?
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: how come everybrony can draw but me?
<AJIsAwesome> mentallyeffedguy: I can't draw either.
<Sonny> mentallyeffedguy I had a drawing but it was terrible
<Applejack2012> I have 999 subs
<CCCP> Lil_B Well i belive there are no need for guns, (im trying to change this topic to the 2nd amedment to piss people off)
<killerpony7733> mentallyeffedguy not everyone can draw i can't really for example so you aren't alone
<Klumzeedragon> mentallyeffedguy: I can only kind of draw? :P But I need templates and shiz to draw well.
<tSparx> CCCP: I call your bluff: no :P
<Applejack2012> I haven't drawn since I was a kid
<Lil_B> CCCP whats the second amedment? (I'm no english :P )
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: I started out drawing stick figures.
<CCCP> You see the 2nd amendment is pointless! Guns are not inportant anymore
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: keep that as a motivation
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: hahahaha thats funny
<tSparx> Lil_B: The 2nd amendment of the US consituttion
<Vivix> Totallyagreedbutcan'tdiscussthathere
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Right to bear arms.
<SafariMonkey> Applejack2012: Can I bring it to 1000?
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: true though
<CCCP> tSparx wat?
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: you dont know how terrible i am
<Lil_B> oh
<Vivix> Everything comes with practice
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: I'm talking about stick figures here XD
<Sonny> KnifeH can you send me your youtube channel adress? Wanna check you out
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: True. :D
<tSparx> Lil_B: "The maintenance of a well-ordered militia being necessary for the defense of the union, the right to bear arms shall not be abridged." (A close paraphrase)
<Sonny> do it in private
<Vivix> Just keep at it, and try to avoid drawing what you know, and draw what you see
<Sonny> :)
<Maid_RainBow> looks like she drank to much Apple Cider
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: ill give you sub, but i cant excacly prove it
<Sonny> yup
<Lil_B> ok, thanks XD
<KnifeH> Sonny: http://www.youtube.com/user/KnifeH
<KnifeH> True
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: But they are. We need them to be able to protect our houses and such. And in some cases they have stopped armed robberies. :) In a way they're good and in a way it's bad. It's best to have an ammendment for it, rather than everypony and there grandma breaking the law by carrying anyway.
<mentallyeffedguy> always nice to meet someone who actually has a talent :P
<KnifeH> YouTube stat refresh rate, yay
<Brad[Laptop]> mentallyeffedguy Ive been looking at pony drawing tutorials but have yet to attempt it, im my own greatest critic, if something looks even a little off ill get angry with myself, heh.
<tSparx> Lil_B: Because that's a grammatical clusterfuck, there's a lot of controversy in the US over exactly what that amendment means xD
<Jmo> Dat 200.
<Sonny> KnifeH sub it is :D
<Lil_B> I only got one A in art in my whole life... and that was on a redrawing of "Fear" (looks like "The Scream", also same Artist) with Wax Colors
<mentallyeffedguy> Brad[Laptop]: me too and it goes right in the trash
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: Talent? What is that
<Brad[Laptop]> mentallyeffedguy yep!!
<Brad[Laptop]> I might just try tracing some stuff to get my confidence up and see how that goes
<mentallyeffedguy> drawing! :P its kindof a talent
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: It is :3
<Sonny> I'm trying to do my best as well
<Vivix> talent is a big part of how fast you learn, I figure
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: now you have 200 subs :3
<Applejack2012> sure you can make it to 1000
<Lil_B> I rarily say good things about my Creations, but that probably the best thing I have ever done in my live -.-
<AJIsAwesome> How much do tablets run for?
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: Awesome :D
<Klumzeedragon> KnifeH: A talent is a natural gift. Like a cutie mark is based of that ponies talent. :)
<Sonny> nono mentallyeffedguy make that 201
<Sonny> :D
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon alot of people already have the rights to own guns and dont want to. Guns DO kill people, Guns really arent neccasarry im not saying the need to be outlawed but really guns are not essencial to anyone in most of america.
<Brad[Laptop]> I just want to be able to draw ponies good enough to draw them randomly on things
<mentallyeffedguy> hahahaha Sonny cool
<KnifeH> Klumzeedragon: My cutiemark is a booze bottle
<Sonny> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone know how much a tablet runs for today?
<Brad[Laptop]> AJIsAwesome drawing tablet?
<Vivix> from cheap to expensive
<SafariMonkey> KnifeH: I subscribed, then unsubscribed as I want you to enjoy your sweet 200
<Vivix> I think 50-500 and up
<KnifeH> AJIsAwesome: Depends. Do you want crap or good?
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: Yes.
<Jmo> Genius Vivix.
<Vivix> hehe
<Jmo> 'Cheap to expensive'
<Vivix> I r smru!
<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: Good.
<Brad[Laptop]> AJIsAwesome 50-3000, depends what you want
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<SafariMonkey> there
<MadSurge> KnifeH: You like drinking? :D
<KnifeH> AJIsAwesome: If good, 160 dollars, considering a small tablet but good quality
<Vivix> but yeah 50-70 for cheap, and around 300-700 and more for great I guess
<CCCP> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
<tSparx> Hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<Applejack2012> hi
*Bronysith glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: How much is yours?
<Applejack2012> My channel http://www.youtube.com/user/Alphahumphrey2011?feature=mhee
<AJIsAwesome> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Hi! :)
<KnifeH> http://www.letsgodigital.org/images/artikelen/71/wacom-bamboo-fun-tablet.jpg I draw with this
<MadSurge> Hallo TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
<KnifeH> It's nothing
<Lil_B> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<Sonny> If I would have a cutie mark it would be...
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: In a way, I agree. But at the same time... So many people would be completely outraged to have that right taken away. Some people enjoy shooting at ranges and stuff as a pass time or a hobby. They arent all used to as personal defense or murder weapons.
<KnifeH> Mine was the price I quoted.
*Spectrum_Rush is lucky as hell he got a tablet for free from his BFF
<CCCP> KnifeH lol i own one of those
<KnifeH> CCCP: That's what I draw with :p
<killerpony7733> Applejack2012 Careful to link something like your own youtube channel as you are advertising without mod permission plus it's youtube so you are breaking two rules there bud
<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: Ok. Thanks.
<SafariMonkey> KnifeH: Same! but I have Large
<killerpony7733> Applejack2012 youtube is considered video links and when theres a stream it's not allowed
<Klumzeedragon> KnifeH: I don't know what my cutie mark would be. :P But a booze bottle sounds awesome. :D
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon yeah i know... but still out of all the problems the right of owning guns seems pretty unimprtant.
<KnifeH> Klumzeedragon: :D
<Brad[Laptop]> AJIsAwesome it really depends on the size of the table as well, how much of a drawing surface you want
<Bronysith> CCCP: whats wrong with owning a gun?
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: Okay. Thank you.
<Pearly> interesting, so we can take MLP and put it into our own stuff...?
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: you have the best tool to draw with i see :P
<CCCP> Bronysith guns kill people
<Applejack2012> I just wanted show KnifeH my Youtube adress as he just showed his link
<Klumzeedragon> killerpony7733: Although it is a youtube link, it's not a video link and therefore doesnt break that rule? 6_9
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: No man. I'm spending 2800 dollars on a new tablet in a few months
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: Incorrect, guns don't kill people. People kill people.
<Bronysith> CCCP: so? why is the right to own a gun stupid?
<SafariMonkey> KnifeH: I got mine 2nd hand, 50 quid
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome ugh -_-
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: even then the bullet is the one to kill
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: lol veldig bra, veldig bra
<killerpony7733> Klumzeedragon youtube link=techinally a video link+self advertisement still breaking rules
<AJIsAwesome> JUst saying.
<KnifeH> Jadå
<Bronysith> CCCP: tell me why the right to own a gun is stupid?
<Bronysith> NOW
<Applejack2012> bra Knife!
<KnifeH> Ja för helvete
<Brad[Laptop]> AJIsAwesome Once a gun is convicted of murder, then guns kill people.
<KnifeH> :D
<tSparx> CCCP: look at what you've done! I was saying earlier that this is a conversation you couldn't tempt me to get in on :P
<killerpony7733> Bronysith look at any other country without the right to owning a gun and then the US. US the highest rate of death by guns
<KnifeH> Guns are for people that try and shoot Scootaloo trying to fly
<KnifeH> Big dislike.
<tSparx> CCCP: I'm not as passionate about it as I am some of the other arguments I've had, and while I do have an opinion, I'm boycotting such a never-ending discussion here :)
<Brad[Laptop]> killerpony7733 reserach that statistic, it also includes suicides.
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: Well, even if we didn't have that ammendmet, people would still illegally aquire guns and kill and rob and we the standard citizen wouldnt be allowed to have our own protection and even if we did, we'd be breaking the law for it.
<killerpony7733> Brad[Laptop] So it only adds to how bad it is cause the US allows it
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: i think in sweden every household has a machine gun, correct me if im wrong Wrek
<Vivix> super wrong I think
<Wrek> 05and axe
<CCCP> Bronysith i mean, im talking about the second amendment made sense a long time ago, but really most people dont need guns, they are dangerious weather or not you mean them to be or not. I mean America has a lot of horrible shootings all because of guns, most crimes with guns are commited by people who buy guns
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: kjennar du Wrek siden han e svensk og du e svensk?
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: Also if all guns were gone, we'd just find other ways to kill eachother. People are stupid. :P
<CCCP> tSparx D:
<Vivix> But why is "everyone does it anyway" an excuse to accept it?
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: Ja, jag är svensk
<Vivix> Oh people use cocaine, might aswell fucking legalize it
<Bronysith> CCCP: but those are bad people boy, the right to own guns is the right to defend yourself
<killerpony7733> Bronysith the best you can own of a gun is if you are a hunter or the likes and it can only be non combat shotguns and hunting rifles
<Brad[Laptop]> We dont have the right to own guns in canada, only with a special license you can have them. Guess what? All the criminals have them either way.
<tSparx> CCCP: You have fun with it, I'll be back when you're done :P
<KnifeH> Wrek: Skype!
<Bronysith> CCCP: take away that right and then only bad people have guns
<Klumzeedragon> ^
<Vivix> And that's a bad thing?
<Applejack2012> And I'm Danish
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: eg vet at du e svenska, det står jo på profilen din :P kjennar du Wrek ?
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon yeah i guess.. It just seems like the debate about the 2nd ammendment never goes anywhere just a shout at the other side and no one gets anything done...
<Bronysith> CCCP: THATS POLITICS
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: Har mött honom på BUCK
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<Vivix> I shouldn't even care, I'm not american
<Lil_B> ^
<mentallyeffedguy> KnifeH: ka e buck?
<Jmo> Baail~
<CCCP> Bronysith its hard to find the "Bad" people
<KnifeH> mentallyeffedguy: Brony UK
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: the norwegian MF
<SafariMonkey> will doctor Who be on later?
<Vivix> mentallyeffedguy, Ke?
<Wrek> 05guns dont kill people people kill people, and monkeys do to
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: excacly
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: The question you really wanna ask is, "Is Sumi streaming later?"
<KnifeH> Wrek: You kill society with that pic you're drawing.
<KnifeH> I approve.
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: guns dont kill people, i kill people, with guns!
<SafariMonkey> tSparx: Same question really. :P
<Vivix> Someone put Scootaloo in rehab
<Maid_RainBow> aah Wrek she looks so cute
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: That's a discussion. :) We all have an opinnion. It just helps to make both sides see the point eachother is stating. Im open minded in my debates.
<Shizuka> 13but i think the gun helps wrek
<KnifeH> Silence, Vivix
<Shizuka> 13you don't just run up to somepony und go BANG
<KnifeH> scootaloo is awesome
<icefang99> Hey guys! :D
<Vivix> ;__;
<Bronysith> OH GOD PHOENIX WRIGHT OST with orchestra, SO FUCKING AWESOME
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon yes but with Guns it never gets anywhere
<Klumzeedragon> And now the mods are in on it too. :P
<Maid_RainBow> KnifeH : Scoot is best CMC
<Shizuka> 13especially not if you have access to your grandfather's arsenal
<Vivix> CCCP, true, noone ever agrees on that issue
<KnifeH> Maid_RainBow: YES
<Lil_B> Bronysith true that :)
<Applejack2012> Scoot is best chicken
<Sonny> Oh mother of god
<Sonny> even the mods are talking in the chat about guns now
<Sonny> we're doomed
<SafariMonkey> Guys, is Sumica streaming later? I gotta get my Who fix.
<KnifeH> Applejack2012: just lost 85% of my respect
<Sonny> this subject will never change
<Sumica> 00,10no, got work tonight
<Lil_B> Bronysith btw have you seen the Phoenix Wright 5 screenshots?
<Shizuka> 13silly fillies i am making references with wrek
<Wrek> 05Shizuka <3
<Wirisme> Aw
<Bronysith> Lil_B: nope
<Applejack2012> Scoot is best filly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizukai think heavy does just go to people and go bang
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: Aaw...
<KnifeH> Applejack2012: Can't change it
<Shizuka> 13no trixie, he goes up to people und goes POW
<Shizuka> 13totally different :3
<Lil_B> Bronysith don't, unless you like a more... 3D Style
<Sonny> Scootaloo hasn't have any wings O_o
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Not yet...........
<mentallyeffedguy> Sonny: it will come!
<KnifeH> ..
<Brad[Laptop]> you lie
<Sonny> :o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka different caliber :p different sounds :p
<KnifeH> She's laying on her side
<KnifeH> And there's a booze bottle in the way
<KnifeH> You wouldn't see them
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: See how selfish I am? I don't care that you've got work, only that I won't see Doctor who on here
<CCCP> Free Love!
<twilight_sprinkle> wow
<Wirisme> d'aww
<SafariMonkey> I do really. :P]
<twilight_sprinkle> drunk scootaloo...
<KnifeH> Wrek: Awy yeah, you did it right
<KnifeH> I am sorry twilight_sprinkle
<Bronysith> i put a hat on Shizuka
<KnifeH> Art trade
<KnifeH> wrek have to do it
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: Sure it does, I see what you're saying and I agree that it is stupid and pointless... :S But I mean, that would just leave all the bad people with the illegal guns they can get their hands on while the innocent get none for protection. Cause it's not the good citzens doing all the shootings. It's mainly the people that acquire them illegally.
<Sonny> haha 20% more awesome Cider xDxD
<Sonny> :p
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tl;dr
<twilight_sprinkle> KnifeH: eh, i can always pause stream. altho some things cannot be unseen
<KnifeH> Sonny: Of course :3
<KnifeH> I had to
<KnifeH> I cry to my own speedpaints.
<KnifeH> I am a sad person
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon i guess... that makes sense too..
<CCCP> KnifeH *hugs* still sad?
<KnifeH> CCCP: Yes
<KnifeH> CCCP: but it produces good art
<KnifeH> CCCP: so I don't mind
<Vivix> Suffer for your art!
<Maid_RainBow> KnifeH : i like Scoot alot she is best CMC and i hate it that someponies call her a chicken it makes me sad
<Vivix> Do it!
<CCCP> Winston Churhill had depression
<Vivix> I'm not quite okay with seeing her with booze, but the picture is nicely drawn
<Wrek> 05is that satisfactory KnifeH? :P
<alexxm> this pictures oddly cute
<ScottishUnicorn> Scoot is best CMC
<mentallyeffedguy> anyone else that have watched friendship is witchcraft?
<Sonny> Ofcrouse it is ^^
<KnifeH> Wrek: Hmmm..
<Vivix> Note, that I stop reading fics when they go "LETS BOOZE PARTY"
<icefang99> .-. Alone again...naturally...
<Maid_RainBow> alexxm : its is because its Scoot
<ScottishUnicorn> It's on my list of things to do

<Brad[Laptop]> Its very well done, good writing.
<KnifeH> I should stream on bronystate XD
<KnifeH> It'd be fun doing art in front of people
<Klumzeedragon> Maid_RainBow: I knooooow~ Twas a joke in all good fun. :)
<CCCP> Brad[Laptop] yes i agree its one of the best shows on TV
<Maid_RainBow> Klumzeedragon : i know it is but i just dont like it
<AJIsAwesome> KnifeH: Actually, I would like to see what you stream. It would be nice to see how you draw.
<Brad[Laptop]> CCCP season 5 is last season, 8 episodes just finished airing and they will air the last 8 episodes summer of 2013, then the series is over forever.

<Applejack2012> I don't know what Dr. Who is
<Klumzeedragon> Maid_RainBow: Aw. Then I apologize. :)
<Brad[Laptop]> CCCP they never let the quality of the shows down, i figure they are going out on a high note by stopping at season 5.
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon yeah i know but im lazy

<Amber> I'm watching The Hunger Games.... I'm crying at a certain part... :'( :(
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: I mean I have all of season 5 torrented. :) I've watched the first 4 on Netflix.
<SafariMonkey> thelonepony: east US?
<tSparx> CCCP: The list of things I have to do/watch/read/consume is already far too large, chances are good I won't see Breaking Bad for years -- and I'm fine with that *shrug*
<icefang99> What do you guys think the next spyro game should be?
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon oh lol
<AJIsAwesome> Hunger games is too dark for me, I probably wouldn't like to read it.
<Applejack2012> There is only one episode on The Ticket Master only with Scandinavian dub
<Applejack2012> DVD
<CCCP> tSparx your missing out i personally think even though hard to compare with FiM i think its better than FiM
<AJIsAwesome> AppleDash: Just one? I thought they bundle more episodes. So it's just that one?
<AJIsAwesome> TAB FAIL!!! :|
<Klumzeedragon> Brad[Laptop]: I know, I've seen the first 4 seasons, I'm just on BronyState all day. So I never get a chance to watch season 5. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack2012: Just one? I thought they bundle more episodes. So it's just that one?
<Applejack2012> Only one but a Twilight figure was included
<mentallyeffedguy> anyone know when the new season starts?
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack2012: Ok. How much do the DVDs run for?
<AJIsAwesome> !cd

<SafariMonkey> bye KnifeH
*CCCP hugs killerpony7733 i will be your Domanatrix

<CCCP> Obsidian lol
<AJIsAwesome> Rue-Fan6414: Hi! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Rue-Fan6414
<tSparx> MrMalk: Oh no, what happened?
<BladedWings> hi Rue-Fan6414
<Rue-Fan6414> :)
<Ravebrony> My teacher told the class "Pshh, if you think I care whether or not you're here, you're sadly mistaken. Just know that I won't review a Thing for you"
<MrMalk> tSparx grandfather
<CCCP> school is pointless
<AJIsAwesome> Ravebrony: Yep, just like most professors in my classes.
<Ravebrony> Ya :D
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: No it's not. You learn valuable things.
<tSparx> MrMalk: Prayers/good thoughts your way
<Rue-Fan6414> Buffering!
<CCCP> AJIsAwesome like?
<thelonepony> the Buffer Show!
<Obsidian> What happened to stream?
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: You probably just don't like the way they administer the information.
<MrMalk> tSparx thanks he should be ok though Im not completely sure
<SafariMonkey> Yeah, here too
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Gummy Tries All Day Long
<Klumzeedragon> That chat derp.
<Ravebrony> CCCP: You learn the fundamentals of Life! :D
<tSparx> CCCP: It's only as useful as you make it.
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: That fanfic seems interesting. :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: My school is pointless, today was the first day back and they sent 50 people home for incorrect uniform :|
<MASF123> What "fun" is there to life?
<Klumzeedragon> But I'm going to be a little quite as I work on the art I'm drawing. :P
<CCCP> Ravebrony i dont think i need school to get taught that...
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: The fun that you make of it.
<MASF123> But what fun?
*Dark92Enigma Insert dancing frog to go with the stream:..........HELLO MY BABY, HELLO MY DARLING!
<AJIsAwesome> *out of it*
<tSparx> MASF123: Sex, drugs, good music, a nice hike, comedy, a roller coaster, sitting with someone you love, etc. etc.
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: Varies between the person.
<CCCP> MLP_Brovakiin my school doesnt have uniforms which is the only good part
<Ravebrony> Hello my ragtime Gaaal~
<MASF123> SO I should try drugs? :S
<Ravebrony> o_o
<Obsidian> tSparx: Don't forget ponies
<CCCP> MASF123 depends
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: Mine cares more about the uniform than the education
<MLP_Brovakiin> MASF123: I don't see why not?
<Ravebrony> Drugs are Never the answer, nor is death.
<MASF123> Because I've always been suicidal, maybe drugs should be a step in the right direction.
<SafariMonkey> MLP_Brovakiin: How strict uniform? Here we wear suits of our own. They just collected a load of old skirts and said if girls had inappropriate skirts they'd have to change into them.
<CCCP> weed isnt a drug >.>
<AJIsAwesome> Well, I'm off to get some lunch. See you in a little while! :)
<MASF123> oh....weed you mean.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> is the stream over or is my pc messing up again??
<Ravebrony> Wuuuut
<CCCP> hello QuinnThePegaSistta :)
<Rue-Fan6414> Buffer!
<MASF123> Stream is derped
<thelonepony> get the cook
<SirGanjalf> Weed is a drug, just as tobacco or coffee is.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> hey CCCP
<Obsidian> Its the buffer show
<thelonepony> coke*
<killerpony7733> SirGanjalf exactly
<Ravebrony> ^
<tSparx> CCCP: Weed is too a drug, what defintition are yo uusing?
<CCCP> tSparx weed is a plant
<SafariMonkey> CCCP: weed affects your physiological processes significantly, so yes it is.
<CCCP> or should i saw Canabis...
<tSparx> CCCP: And? So is aspirin
<QuinnThePegaSistta> its also a drug CCCP
<CCCP> SafariMonkey at least its not negative
<MASF123> Lol. A "drug" is any type of medicine or pill that can be abused as an addcition. Yup Weed is a drug.
<Ravebrony> Drugs are bad mmmmk?
<SafariMonkey> CCCP: Unless you mean weeds. :p
<MASF123> Mmmkay?
<Rue-Fan6414> Anypony here like The Hunger Games?
<Ravebrony> I do
<Bronysith> Rue-Fan6414: the book is good
<BladedWings> Rue-Fan6414: the book or movie
<CCCP> SafariMonkey lol
<Bronysith> Rue-Fan6414: movie is terrible
<QuinnThePegaSistta> not really :'(
<Ravebrony> didnt read the book... buuut, the Movie is good :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> SafariMonkey: They said to us that if girls wear tight trousers they will be sent home because it apparently "Distracts learning" So yep very strict rules
<tSparx> MASF123: That's not a good definition of a drug, because the psychadelic drugs are all non-addictive (via physical mechanism at least -- *anything* can be psychologically addicting).
<Rue-Fan6414> BladedWings: Both
<Obsidian> Not the biggest fan
<SafariMonkey> MASF123: and CCCP A substance that has a physiological effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body
<tSparx> Obsidian: Right, ponies, duh!
<BladedWings> Rue-Fan6414: oh well then never read the book and never seen the movie :D
<SafariMonkey> That is the definition of a drug
<CCCP> herion is supposdly an orgasim X10 in the gut for a long time....
<Ravebrony> And das bad
<MASF123> When I am feeling down, she has always got my got my back. Hmm...hm...hmm...something giant hat. Yes I love my sister Rarity!
<tSparx> CCCP: It's more like bliss then sleep. Oh, and terrible, terrible addiction.
<Obsidian> Same old chat. THe minute stream is dead, it turns to drugs6_9
<Ravebrony> Lol!
<Wirisme> what's on next?
<CCCP> tSparx its only addictive if you let it be... jk
<SirGanjalf> Speaking about drugs: Anyone here watching "Breaking Bad"?
<SirGanjalf> Because i've started recently...
<ScottishUnicorn> It's on my list of things to watch
<MASF123> Weed stinks so bad.
<BladedWings> is that CrazyCherry gone?
<SafariMonkey> MLP_Brovakiin: Here girls can wear skirts, knee length. Boys need smart jackets and trousers that hold a crease. we also need dress shirts and ties.
<tSparx> Ravebrony: Drugs are never the *answer*, but boy are they fun
<ScottishUnicorn> I'm watching Malcom in the Middle right now :P
<mitamaking> hello

<MASF123> Next apartment reeks of it and at my friend's house it stinks like weed because of his brother.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello mitamaking
<SafariMonkey> CCCP: pretty good
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQpqsQ5icRE
<SirGanjalf> ScottishUnicorn: That's funny cause "Malcolm's dad" is in Breaking Bad
<ScottishUnicorn> SafariMonkey: It's pretty good
<MASF123> I don't know how people can tolerate that smell.
<ScottishUnicorn> Yeah I know, it
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj6-d5jrbs&feature=plcp
<ScottishUnicorn> 's kind of funny
<tSparx> MASF123: I always loved that smell, haha, long before I even knew what it was :P
<CCCP> SirGanjalf oh yeah i heard that... i love Breaking Bad
<MASF123> Getting High must be one hell of a trip.
<tSparx> MASF123: Some people really hate the smell, some people love it.
<Ravebrony> The ONLY time drugs are fun to me are when other people use them at raves. They act like idiots, and can do whatever to them and they dont care :D (because they dont know)
<SirGanjalf> ScottishUnicorn: Yeah, especially when you compare both characters
<tSparx> Almost never any middle ground :)
<SafariMonkey> ScottishUnicorn: Should that be addressed to CCCP?
<CCCP> Holy Shit its on youtube! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fyGrPL2Pdo
<Sumica> 00,10So how about that newsletter eh?
<Eli> evening guys
<MASF123> tSparx, but it stinks that like some liking the smell ofage bags garb
<tSparx> MASF123: It's *nothing* like it's usually portrayed in media, with the hallucinations and crap. But it is fun.
<MASF123> stupid keyboard
<thelonepony> hi Eli :)
<Wirisme> what is this show?
<Eli> no stream or does my laptop derp?
<Obsidian> CCCP: Lets see how long it lasts
<MASF123> Sumica, abut that Newsletter. :)
<Obsidian> Eli: Welcome to the buffer show
<SafariMonkey> CCCP: One ep
<CCCP> Obsidian you mean before its taken down?
<Bronysith> Sumica: who would win in a fight? pinkie pie or deadpool?
<tSparx> MASF123: Some people think it stinks, some people like the smell, idk why, it just is that way -- independently, usually, of whether they use the drug or not
*MASF123 smacks keyboard.
<Eli> Obsidian: ohhh my favourite
<Obsidian> CCCP: Pretty much
<CCCP> Obsidian been around for about a year...
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Is6HeUAAA&feature=plcp
<tSparx> Bronysith: Epic battle that would start off bad for Pinkie, but she'd ultimately win
<MASF123> Deadpool is OP so I'd say...Pinkie Pie.
<Obsidian> CCCP: Then they got lucky
<Eli> Obsidian: i could watch that thing go round and round all day long
<tSparx> MASF123: But if he's OP, doesn't that mean he'll win automatically?
<Sumica> 00,10Pinkie
<SirGanjalf> BTW: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LhgCkXUyzc :D
<MASF123> No it means fanboys dick ride him meaning Pinkie woul win.

<SafariMonkey> spitfirecolt: Helping people is definitely awesome.
<tSparx> 3-2 for MM :D
<pony_7007> Bronysith: OoT

<tSparx> (\
<SafariMonkey> tSparx: Nevr played either...
<BladedWings> wait...chat derp?
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: Have you played an Zelda games?
<MASF123> I agree with tSparx
<spitfirecolt> zelda 1 or 2 which is better for the nes
<BladedWings> nope
<Lil_B> I think it's the uniqueness of Majoras Mask compared to the others
<Moopy> so don't you some ponies don't like the moopster?
<BladedWings> /)
<tSparx> spitfirecolt: Well Zelda 2 was on the SNES, wasn't it?
<Bronysith> tSparx: ...
<spitfirecolt> i like moopster it was on the nes
<Lil_B> spitfirecolt they are too different for me to decide which one is better :/
<MASF123> I had to hoof-wash these damn clothes. :/ Hands are so puny.
<MASF123> pruny.
<tSparx> Bronysith: Was?
<SafariMonkey> No, living where I did the *only* game I had was pokemon crystal (bear in mind DS was already out :P )
<Bronysith> tSparx: no
<Bronysith> NOOOO
<Moopy> no i mean why though?
<Bronysith> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Lil_B> tSparx Son, I'm dissapoint
<Bronysith> tSparx: ZELDA 2 IS FOR THE NES
<tSparx> STFU :P
<Moopy> is it because im mean sometimes?
<Ravebrony> I never played Zelda games, sadly
<MadSurge> tSparx: I AM ERROR
<tSparx> It was like 20 years ago (or it feels that way)
<tSparx> I haven't owned an NES or SNES since I was *9*
<Lil_B> tSparx last year was Zelda's 25th anniversary
<spitfirecolt> now and then i will play zelda 1
<tSparx> Lil_B: Twenty years sicne I first played them (showed up late to the Nintendo/video-games-in-general party)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Look, I have spare time!!!
<spitfirecolt> me too
<Ravebrony> My first games were Spyro and Diablo :3
<MASF123> I love you...LOVE YOU....LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU...Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo- :S
<Ravebrony> Didnt play much else :D
<tSparx> Lil_B: In point of fact it has been less than 20 years, only 13 I think
<Applejack2012> I got my first LCD game in 1983
<MASF123> LCD?
<BladedWings> i love spyro
<MASF123> Spyro was great.
<Ravebrony> Weh ninsomniac had it...
<Lil_B> I have never owned a NES or SNES (or at least played with them) , N64 was my first
<Applejack2012> Love Spyro too
<MASF123> Until Insomiac Games sold their license.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I can't make movie night. I have choreography, then I have a game early the next morning, along with a second sessin....:|
<Ravebrony> *When insomniac
<Ravebrony> MASF123: Yeah...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEChu3hnJhU&feature=BFa&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
<Ravebrony> I cant look at todays Spyro games
<tSparx> Confusingly, I got PSX, then N64, then SNES, then NES, then I sold the Famicon and SNES, then later sold the PSX and N64 to get the PS2, then got a Gamecube, then it broke.
<MadSurge> Eeeeehehehe! The tentacle enemies in this game are described with "still waiting for his day" :D
<Applejack2012> LCD was like Game & Watch
<CrimsonPhoenix> Combining Fluttershy with Skrillex?
<Moopy> It needs about 20% cooler
<CrimsonPhoenix> what has this world come down to
<Ravebrony> My first console was a PS1. I never had anything before that :\
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Just hear the whole thing...It's really good.
<BladedWings> i believe mine was a SNES
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kawaii_icybeauti, I despise THAT kind of dubstep
