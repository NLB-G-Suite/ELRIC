<Cypresswolf> aniderp: If I have to go to work, then you are too - C'mon :3 Up and At 'em - I got an ice cold water gun with a n ichy trigger if you don't

<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: Saturn hates london, why is that? were you mean to him?
<Placebo> Its a beautiful day in the barracks.
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: I'm not sure why he hates London exactly.
<ScootaChicken> I personally like it, it's not the best city in the world but it's fun.
<ScootaChicken> And the public transport system is awesome.
<Bronysith> must be nice not having to drive
<ScootaChicken> If you live in London, it's honestly easier not having a car.
<Placebo> Personally enjoy driving
<ScootaChicken> There's so much traffic and so few parking spaces that you might as well just take the bus/tube everywhere.
<Bronysith> Placebo: i dont like the quick time events
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU go to bread
*Bronysith glomps NewSuperBronyU
<aniderp> i hate the small bus
<ScootaChicken> Although this is mostly in regards to Central London, cars are more useful in the suburban outskirty areas.
<ScootaChicken> Although Bronysith, I do have to ask, why exactly did you link something from my tumblr in here whilst I wasn't even around?
<Phase4> 00,02refresh your streams
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: cause i thought some people would like to see it, sorry
<JRP2234> make me
<Phase4> 00,02refresh again actually, gona risk a better encoder setting

<JRP2234> goto bread Phase4
<Placebo> Phase4: can't watch it anyway :p
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: Don't worry about it, I'm not too fussed or anything, just seemed a bit strange.
<ScootaChicken> Plus I don't like coming off as an attention whore or anything.
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: i was linking cosplays i thought were good
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: speaking of which, are you gonna do kaworu?
<JRP2234> Phase4 iddqd

<Placebo> Off to school. Later
<Jmo> Welcome back aniderp
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: I'm completely broke right now, but if I had enough money to get the wig I could, seeing as I have all the components of it clothing-wise.
<aniderp> i had to refresh my page
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: yea, just not the plugsuit part >.>
<JRP2234> Phase4 you has consoleSS?
<ScootaChicken> But I'm not too keen on doing cosplays of things I don't actually like that much, seeing as I never really got into NGE.
<Bronysith> ScootaChicken: then do that haruhi cosplay
<ScootaChicken> If I do it I'll just wear a short sleeved dress shirt and black trousers.
<ScootaChicken> Bronysith: LEL.

<Kandarihu> Dear Princess Celestia. Exactly 24 hours ago, I realized (although I guess I already knew) that people's chatbuffers still last more than the 30 seconds that The HUB used to display spoilers of the upcoming season. When that ad comes up, it's best to just ignore the ad altogether.
<Jake> and then SUGAR RUSH
<Alchemist> how about a vanilla pudding filled chocolate cupcake?
<Jake> or bacadi with red pfanner ice tea
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Wrek> 052 bits of ice

<Alchemist> Im not a fan of it either
<Jake> peach schnaps then bailys and blu curacao and a shot of grenadine
<Jake> looks crazy

<Phase4> 00,02time for sleep
<Alchemist> or plainly just beer
<Jake> or hot met with bluberry and cherry

<Saturn> 08,01i have the offer of a Beyerdynamic MCE86 shotgun

<Jake> once our forum is ready you can "apply" for our project if you want to
<Saturn> 08,01i'm just wondering whether it's worth me getting the MCE86
<Saturn> 08,01i'd essentially be getting these for free, as a swap for my bass guitar
*Everlasting_Joy claps.

<Vordox> Pokecolt: One of th ebest ones
<Wrek> 05i was there when it first aired on CN
<Wrek> 05good times
<Buytoast> no, i dont think it had a proper finale
<Buytoast> and it probably wont
<Pokecolt> DBZ in the original days was the best thing toonami ever had ever.
<AJIsAwesome> Agreedm Wrek.
<Vordox> Wrek: back when Cartoon Network was Cartoons.
<AJIsAwesome> *Agreed
<Buytoast> seeing as how aku's VA is dead
<Kandarihu> Hmm, shetting VEEMI's aspect ratio to 16:10 seems to make the time portal actually circular.
<Vordox> Cow and Chicken, Dexter's Lab...

<Vordox> Ryunosuke: And we all know why. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> hell, dbz is probably the worst anime ive seen imo. it wouldve been fine if it were 6-7 times shorter
<Vordox> Yeah, CN did not use DBZ I think
<Pokecolt> I remember when adult swim had futurama on at 10pm.
<Pokecolt> Those were good days.
<Kandarihu> DBZ was on Toonami for a long time.
<AJIsAwesome> DBZ was aired on Toonami, IIRC.

<NekoC> OOZES
<Vordox> The Duck Dodgers episode "Samurai Quack" was dedicated to spoofing the various stylistic elements and plot devices of Samurai Jack, such as only ever killing robots and the progressive ripping of clothes leading up to the final battle of the episode. Tartakovsky himself also made a cameo in that episode.[21] The role of Aku is played by Dodgers's Happy Cat alarm clock voiced by Mako.
<NekoC> tl:dr

<AJIsAwesome> Hooray, overrated song just beat an overrated song.
<Hoody|Skool> Heyo browniestate
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Hoody|Skool.
<Hoody|Skool> AJIsAwesome: What overrated song?
<AJIsAwesome> Gangnam Style.
<Hoody|Skool> Don't tell me your on the spriggle side
<Hoody|Skool> -_-
<BladedWings> hi Hoody|Skool
<Hoody|Skool> Hi Bladed
<AJIsAwesome> I was fine with the song at first, but now it's just plain annoying.
<Bronysith> hey, PSY deserves that spot
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, Gangnam Style isn't overrated
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: it is overplayed
<AJIsAwesome> Alright, amybe not overrated. Overplayed, yes.
<AJIsAwesome> *maybe
<Bronysith> It is still awesome
<Hoody|Skool> AJIsAwesome: I think you mean overused then, not overrated
<BladedWings> When Gangnam Style is combined with an ICP song, you know its overused :D
<AJIsAwesome> It's an "okay" song to me, but it gets more acclaim than it really needs.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: well at least you arent insulting people who like it
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Of course not. That's their opinion, and they're entitled to it.
<Hoody|Skool> In that case I agree with you, I've seen this song waaaaay too many times
<Lil_B> Vordox I have a question... or rather a Problem
<Vordox> Lil_B: Yeah?
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: yes, you know how you can have an opinion, it is when you start insulting other peoples opinions is when you are now an asshole
<Hoody|Skool> Rrg
<Hoody|Skool> This chat gets along too well
<BladedWings> Hoody|Skool: eeyup, we sure do lol
<AJIsAwesome> Hoody|Skool: Why would we be each other throats?
<AJIsAwesome> Anger blinds.
<AJIsAwesome> *be at
<Hoody|Skool> Anger is fleeting
<Hoody|Skool> Anger is pinged
<pony_5205> hi there; no stream? :)

<Hoody|Skool> no stream
<BladedWings> hi pony_5205 and nope stream just ended
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: well earlier today i linked a pic of my friend cosplaying and then some asshole said that cosplay is bad and all cosplayers are disgraceful
<Hoody|Skool> Bronysith: Who?
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Well then that's not the right thing to do. He shouldn't insult their interests, regardless if he doesn't like it.
<Hoody|Skool> I haven't slept in 25 hours~
<AJIsAwesome> Hoody|Skool: You should sleep. :S
<Hoody|Skool> AJIsAwesome: FUCK THAT SHIT
<BladedWings> Hoody|Skool: go to bread
<Hoody|Skool> I have bread
<AJIsAwesome> Hoody|Skool: Go to bed?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hoody|Skool: Try to beat 38+ hours, that is my record :3
<Hoody|Skool> No bed at school ;~;
<Hoody|Skool> MLP_Brovakiin: Mah record be 37, yo
<BladedWings> yes there is, its called a desk lol
<Hoody|Skool> Not good enough
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hoody|Skool: I win! \:D/
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, if you stay up too long, you start hallucinating. You don't want that to happen, my friend.
<Hoody|Skool> MLP_Brovakiin: I can beat you
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: and then he was all, Oh now im being insulted for having an opinion, cause me and another guy were defending our friend and cosplayers...but he said he was insulted, after insulting all cosplayers, which is an assholish move
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hoody|Skool: Try it >:3
<Hoody|Skool> AJIsAwesome: Oh hey slendy, watchu doin here?
<AJIsAwesome> Hoody|Skool: ?
*Hoody|Skool hugs AJIsAwesome
<Hoody|Skool> Do we really have that many idlers? >.>
<BladedWings> maaaybe <_<
<Syl|Lunch> sorry, i was stuffing my face
<AJIsAwesome> Hoody|Skool: Yes. :D
<Buytoast> wait a second there boy
<Buytoast> wait a darn second
*Hoody|Skool waits
<Eddmario> Someone needs to put the clip of Scootaloo's drum solo to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrlhLaNClgw
<naturesfury> seconds over
<Buytoast> if you're going tor ecount events from earlier, at least recount them correctly
<Buytoast> instead of flat out lying
<AJIsAwesome> What's going on?
<Buytoast> Bronysith spun a false tale there
<Hoody|Skool> Eddmario: Best.
<Buytoast> i'm the asshole he's referring to
<Hoody|Skool> Scene
<Hoody|Skool> Evah
<Buytoast> never said cosplay itself is bad and that all cosplayers are disgraceful
<Buytoast> i said it's disgraceful if they start doing it and such and acting like the character in a setting that doesn't call for it
<Hoody|Skool> Buytoast: So it's not cosplay, it's bad acting you don't like?
<Buytoast> attention whoring more or less
<Alchemist> no wonder these guys live in celibacy :D http://derpy.me/CcztZ
<Hoody|Skool> also, I like how you shut up once Bronysith came in
<Buytoast> cosplay all you want at a convention or party or what not
<Buytoast> have at it
<AJIsAwesome> I think what he's saying is that there's a time and place for everything.
<Buytoast> jsut don't do it in an area where you have no buisiness doing it
<Buytoast> pretty much
<pony_5205> I agree with that
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo-tWlETq8w
<Hoody|Skool> Can I cosplay as a naked man at home?
<Buytoast> if that's how they were interpreting it, no wonder they were flipping their shit over what i said
<pony_5205> same for ponies really *ducks*
<Bronysith> But L is just standard dress wear, a shirt, and pants
<AJIsAwesome> pony_5205: Nah, it's cool. I understand what you mean.
*Hoody|Skool munches on his popcorn
<Buytoast> well he had that eyeliner on with the messed up hair and the barefeet
<Bronysith> it is cosplay
<Buytoast> and he was sitting all scrunched up like an egg
<Hoody|Skool> Was it GOOD cosplay?
<Buytoast> never watched death note so i cant say
<Buytoast> but according to him it is
<Hoody|Skool> Ah
<Syl|Homework> Do we have a photo of this cosplay in question?
<Syl|Homework> for perspective
<Hoody|Skool> I would pay money to see a guy walk to school in a gundam suit
<Bronysith> ^
<Bronysith> Im already planning on that actually Hoody|Skool
<Hoody|Skool> Sometimes, you gotta make entertainment for yourself
<twilight_sprinkle> aha, i know what pic this is about
<Buytoast> although i will give him credit for walking barefoot in a subway
<Buytoast> that shit's nasty
<Hoody|Skool> Eat fresh

<alexxm|foal> bye BladedWings
<twilight_sprinkle> he said he doesnt care about the logic as long as it works, then he takes 10% off because i wrote a function to normalize 3 vectors at the same time, instead of 1 and calling three times
<twilight_sprinkle> was a pretty important assignment too

<Syl|Homework> Metronome: Ah, that would be "an"
<Hoody|Skool> ITS FUCKING AN
<Metronome> Thx guys
<twilight_sprinkle> it wasnt my fault my teacher cant decide on how to grade
<Hoody|Skool> Where would you use "A" eagle?
<Buytoast> although it didn't help that he doesn't really teach you, so much as makes you take his code and plug shit in like a mr potato head doll
<Metronome> How about Uniform?
<Buytoast> and if you dunno what to read his stuff like you won't know what to do
<AJIsAwesome> Metronome: A uniform.
<Syl|Homework> ^
<Bronysith> Metronome: were you not taught before on when to use An or A?
<Metronome> Just to be sure, thx guys
<Hoody|Skool> Just say it out loud, and whichever one sounds better works
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Bronysith> An if the next word starts with a vowel or sounds like the beginning of a vowel like you would say An hour because the H is silent
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: What's with the square box?
<Bronysith> I believe it is an hour...
<Hoody|Skool> Yeah, an hour
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Yep.

<Eddmario> Who would win in a fight, Bruce Campbell or "god"
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, that's got to be one heck of an ego you got there to be willing to judge God, AND think you could hurt him.
<Hoody|Skool> Judaism is the only religion I can name that hasn't done anything harmful to any outside group or person
<Bronysith> Hoody|Skool: ...
<Hoody|Skool> Bronysith: I'm not very edumakatid
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i was joking for the most
<Bronysith> Jews fucking crucified jesus christ Hoody|Skool
<pony_5205> Thank God I'm an atheist. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: but i will judge him same as everyone else if he exists
<Bronysith> NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
<Hoody|Skool> Bronysith: We're talking about religious practices, not bible stories
<AJIsAwesome> So, seen any any good movies lately?

<Lil_B> does anyone know if it was G Major or G Minor which is often used to extremly detune music?
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: G Major.
<Kandarihu> Lil_B, G Magor, I think
<Hoody|Skool> Kandarihu: K. They killed one of their own. Not harming an outside group or entity
<AJIsAwesome> If I remember correct.
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome: Kandarihu thanks, I'm currently listening to something in G Minor and thought "wasn't this this tune most of this creepy Videos have?" thanks for the Answer :)

<MLP_Brovakiin> *joke
<MLP_Brovakiin> :3
<Hoody|Skool> 3:
<Kandarihu> MLP_Brovakiin, no, it's a dirty joke
<AJIsAwesome> Hoody|Skool: I meant that for people who saw it as a sexual joke. I'm not that immature to make that kind of a joke.
<Hoody|Skool> AJIsAwesome: You acknowledged it as a sex joke, therefore, you are as much to blame
<pony_5206> I'm to short to 69 :(
<pony_5206> *too
*Hoody|Skool pulls pony_5206's legs longer
<AJIsAwesome> Hoody|Skool: I acknowledged it as one so that people who initially would make an immature joke as that would understand that I wasn't trying to make one.
<naturesfury> there always somr1 out there for you
<Hoody|Skool> AJIsAwesome: Okay okay, I can't troll you, gosh >.>

<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeYnX9NwB1k&feature=related
<Eddmario> Click if you want to see spoilers.
<Bronysith> Eddmario: dat spoiler link
<Bronysith> Eddmario: see you in 24 hours
<MLP_Brovakiin> inb4 ban...
<MLP_Brovakiin> :3
<killerpony7733> Eddmario Eeeyup prepare for bans
<Michael|sick> inb4 banhammer
<Eddmario> Hey, I did a warning. Plus, you don't HAVE to click that link.
<killerpony7733> Oh but you linked it
<MLP_Brovakiin> it is still against the rules :I
<killerpony7733> And that's against rules numbty
<Bronysith> Eddmario: doesnt matter, rule is no linking whatsoever
<killerpony7733> ^
<Nyra> Hello everypony.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Nyra :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Nyra. :)
<AJIsAwesome> How've you been, Nyra? :)
<Eddmario> killerpony7733: On accident. I meant to link to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gZjFrFRaw but my stupid clipboard didn't replace the ED link with the YouTube one.
<Michael|sick> hai Nyra
<Nyra> Well, got some good news and some bad news.
<Bronysith> oh great
<Bronysith> drama
<wipergone2> lol
<Eddmario> Which is why afterwards I warned that it contained spoilers, while the YouTube link is a random MLP vid
<MLP_Brovakiin> Eddmario: You posted the link and then said spoiler, don't try and wing it off :I you know what you did...
<Michael|sick> Eddmario: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24675690.jpg
<Bronysith> Eddmario: doesnt matter, no spoilers link whatsover, no fucking excuses
<Nyra> Good news = Crew for Film is growing, slowly, but surely. Bad News = Hasbro is trying to cover their ass, by asking me to place on my info sites, that they are in no way affiliated with the project. I guess they figure if the film tanks they wont be brought down with it.
<Vordox> For everyone that was looking at Wrek stream during Black Lagoon
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKisi3jJhKQ
<wipergone2> dat trixe
<Nyra> Funny how legal works, huh?
<Boodfire> what film?
<Buytoast> someone linked a spoiler eh?
<Nyra> It bugs me because now, I dont have the added benefit of saying its a team-up with Hasbro, but whatevs.
<Nyra> Whatcha gonna do, right.
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> oh, he left
<TrixieTheMagnificent> Buytoast nah link is fine, people still don't get the spoilers rule
<Nyra> Boodfire: "what film?". I recently payd for the legal right (copyrights) to use MLP as the base for the first ever fan-made full length feature film for our fandom.
<Boodfire> Nyra: what's it going to be about?
<TrixieMuffin> Ponies , presumably
<Michael|sick> nope, do not want spoilers
<Nyra> Nopony wants spoilers on here? Do I have to private chat?
<Boodfire> never mind didn't know it was something that big
<Nyra> Do you still want to know what it is 'generally' about?
<AJIsAwesome> As long as it doesn't have to do with spoilers regarding later season, sure.
<AJIsAwesome> *later season
<Michael|sick> ^

<PinkieDash> www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsAH2jlTiB8 How Valve markets crap
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I'm talking about it in general. Not about the video specifically.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: i know, but people still get it confused all the time
<twilight_sprinkle> people look for racism too much nowadays
<Alchemist> Isnt racism a type of stereotyping by any chance?
<Metronome> PinkieDash: i dont get it :/
<twilight_sprinkle> black guy got arrested? ohp, definitely racism
<Bronysith> Alchemist: no
<twilight_sprinkle> its all dem white cops fault
<Alchemist> Bronysith: how so?
<Bronysith> Alchemist: racism is the false assumption of one race being surperior to another
<Kjakings> 7quick on the uptake there Stormles.
<Kjakings> 7... Stormbles?
<Bronysith> Alchemist: stereotyping is "all blacks eat fried chicken"
<Kjakings> 7English is a fucking stupid language.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i thought that was nationalism, the firs ti mean
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: no
<Alchemist> Bronysith: I always thought its just assumptions based on race.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: that would be one nation being surperior
<PinkieDash> Metronome: Y U No think before you spoiled!
<otakon> hiya guys what's up?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but thats what you said
<thelonepony> Hi otakon :)
<otakon> so dead stream?
<Alchemist> Bronysith: and what you are talking about was racial supremism
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: no, i said racism is the false assumption that ONE RACE, not nation, ONE FUCKING RACE is better than another, fucking read
<Michael|sick> hey otakon :)
<otakon> Bronysith: dude calm down
<Bronysith> Alchemist: RACISM-false assumption that one race is surperior to another
*otakon hands Bronysith a tonberry
*Bronysith pets le tonberry
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: sheesh whats with the rage attack, youre right i get it
<Kjakings> 7Oh, and with regards to earlier: if it helps I'm liable to get more bitter and bitchy like the Kja you know and love over the next month or so Stormbles.

<Stormy> part of the reason Razz pissed me off so much was because she called everyone names like that. Ugh.
<Vordox> wtf is that
<Kjakings> 7It's a condescending term of address. The point is that it's terrible: the aim is to make the object feel inferior.
<otakon> so did anyone else try the Shoot thing?
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: ok then, i was afraid there was something wrong with my connection again

<StinkomanFan> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/439/312/306.jpg Dolan was canon longer than we think :o
<pony_3290> woah deja vu

<Vordox> Oh SHI!
<Vordox> Shizu!
<Yahooz> didnt we ban a dude over trying to start a Pony thread simulator here literally 3 days ago?
<Vordox> http://z0r.de/290 <--- WHICH ANIME IS THIS?!
<Vordox> I haven't found it yet
<Vordox> Or anyone else here who likes anime know which it is?
<thelonepony> Yahooz: i thinks so
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Anyone else here who likes The Offspring?
<thelonepony> wait, i thought it was two days ago
<AmericanTeaDrinker> It looks like a Kyoto Animation production
<StinkomanFan> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/424/638/ac3.png Also, something disturbing.
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8D_no_Go_no_Ni
<AmericanTeaDrinker> That kinda makes sense
<AttackWithHugs> I'm back again
<AttackWithHugs> Had to get foostuffs

<AttackWithHugs> Dead.
<thelonepony> welcome back AttackWithHugs :)
*AttackWithHugs huggles thelonepony

<thelonepony|HW> welp, gotta start on it :I
<CrystalPhoenix> looks like the same art style
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Should I make Ovaltine or tea?
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: I'll take this to bookmark and see how it is

<thelonepony|HW> TANKS? :O
<AmericanTeaDrinker> which should I make?
<Yahooz> >"not a fan of Eurobeat, souless music"
<Yahooz> finally someone with sense
<Vordox> Yahooz: Dubstep back at ya.
<StinkomanFan> Meh, I guess I can go to YTMNd then
<Yahooz> Vordox: what about dubstep?
<RobotdragonX> EY everypony
<Vordox> Yahooz: Eurobeat = Dubstep :P
<Yahooz> ...
<Yahooz> I might have to shoot you
<RobotdragonX> havent visited in a while, been busy recently.
<Yahooz> for such a wrong comment
<CountDoofus> Haio, everybrony.
<Tovler> I kinda prefer dubstep over Eurobeat
<Yahooz> ^^^
<Tovler> welp, back to lurking
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Dubstep is ok
<AmericanTeaDrinker> But Skrillex sucks
<Vordox> Yahooz: Dubstep is souless
<RaveBrony> Ive never heard Eurobeat, but dubstep is the worst O_o
<Vordox> :P
<Yahooz> Eurobeat Brony uses the same frikkin chord progression every single damn time
<RobotdragonX> let the opinion battles...BEGIN
<Yahooz> Im not too big a fan of Dubstep, but at least theres variety
<otakon> Yahooz: and you don't like it?
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Yeah I prefer TLTS
<RaveBrony> WOAH!!!
<thelonepony|HW> tlts?
<thelonepony|HW> wut?
<AmericanTeaDrinker> The Living Tombstone
<CountDoofus> TheLivingTombStone
<thelonepony|HW> ah
<Yahooz> otakon: its an additional thing to the fact that I dont like the music in the first place
<RaveBrony> I love Super Pony Beat! :[
<AmericanTeaDrinker> WoodenToaster is best
<thelonepony|HW> dont know the acronyms and such
<thelonepony|HW> :P
<Yahooz> Archie V >>> any other pony artist out there
<otakon> Yahooz: well that's you, I like Eurobeat Brony's stuff thank you very much
<Yahooz> by far
<Vordox> Dubstep vs Eurobeat = http://z0r.de/316
<AmericanTeaDrinker> WoodenToaster and Alex S need to collaborate if they haven't already.
<Yahooz> AmericanTeaDrinker: im fairly certain they have, and if they havent, then sure, why not
<RaveBrony> Who is Archie V?
<Yahooz> is there a stream?
<Yahooz> ill link his channel
<RobotdragonX> just got the jak ps3 HD trilogy
<thelonepony|HW> no stream atm
<Vordox> Why this war of music goes on
<thelonepony|HW> so go ahead
<Vordox> I WANT TO RUN
<Vordox> http://z0r.de/330
<thelonepony|HW> do it
<CountDoofus> Random question: what color would Lyra's magic be? Yellow?
<Yahooz> Hes under a frikkin record company hes that good
<StinkomanFan> http://chickenlittlemishap.ytmnd.com/ WA-WA-WAAAAA
<thelonepony|HW> CountDoofus: same as here coat
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Ummm no
<CountDoofus> Wouldn't Rarity's be white then too?
<AmericanTeaDrinker> green
<SpeccyRush> most show it as Gold like her eyes
<AmericanTeaDrinker> No green like her mane
<thelonepony|HW> AmericanTeaDrinker: yeah, lyra's coat is green
<AttackWithHugs> My favorite collab song is The Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy by Makkon and PinkiePieSwear
<thelonepony|HW> ah
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Green like her mane
<Yahooz> RaveBrony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_k8Ektoqg8&list=UUAUFghZx1Ny6cskefHB6VpA&index=23&feature=plpp_video
<Yahooz> one of his works
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Twilights magic is purple...
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Raritys magic is purple
<thelonepony|HW> stop distracting me Bronystate :I
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Lunas magic is blue I think.
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Cadence's magic is pink
<thelonepony|HW> AmericanTeaDrinker: well then, the color of her mane then
<SpeccyRush> Rarity's magic is blue
<RaveBrony> ^
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I'm colorblind
<Vordox> Yahooz: Woot, Eurobeat
<Vordox> Yahooz: Thought you hated it
<Yahooz> ...
<Yahooz> ./ignored
<RobotdragonX> derp
<RaveBrony> Yahooz: Eh, not really feeling that one :\
<Yahooz> i cant take the stipidity
<RaveBrony> I love Eurobeat tho, its just so much fun to listen to, haha
<AmericanTeaDrinker> What color is Celestias magic?
<Vordox> Yahooz: You think I was serious?
<CountDoofus> Well, Celestia's magic is yellow.
<RobotdragonX> Celestia is gold magic
<Vordox> RobotdragonX: wrong
<CountDoofus> Yellow, gold, that.
<Vordox> She has 3 magic colours so far
<RobotdragonX> gold yellow WHATEVER
<RobotdragonX> *flips table*
<AmericanTeaDrinker> What color will Sweetie Belles magic be?
<Vordox> I think Yahooz is ignoring me now just cause I was joking with him. >.>
<Vordox> AmericanTeaDrinker: We saw it this episode
<CountDoofus> I'm thinking light purple.
<Derpy_Hooves> http://adamlhumphreys.deviantart.com/#/d5m9rxc <3 <3 <3 <3
<Yahooz> RaveBrony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvSIArLL9SA&feature=BFa&list=UUAUFghZx1Ny6cskefHB6VpA ?
<Yahooz> maybe?
<AmericanTeaDrinker> When?
<Tovler> Sweetie's should be green since here eyes are green
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I didn't see it
<Vordox> Yahooz: I'm suprised on one thing
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I think her magic should be lavender
<Vordox> Yahooz: You say that Eurobeat has the same chord progression, but archie has a rather stale form as well
<SirGanjalf> Celestia is te goddes of Sun. Therefore her magic should consist of all colors.
<SirGanjalf> *goddess
<CountDoofus> Oh yeah, Sweetie Belle's magic is green. Can see it in the latest episode, at 2:00.
<BabSeed> hello
<CountDoofus> Haio BabSeed
<SirWrathy> welp im out for today, n8 and bb everypony :)
<RobotdragonX> sweetie has green magic.... ._. ....changlings....
<SpeccyRush> here we go
<CountDoofus> Later SirWrathy
<Vordox> It seems Yahooz has me on ignore...bah
<RaveBrony> Yahooz: Nah, not feeling this one either :\
<Vordox> Guess I won't get a response on Archie's stale form
<RaveBrony> Its too...simple for me :(
<Yahooz> If only he didnt take down PPS >_<
<AJfan77> Hey guys! Brohoof /]
<CrystalPhoenix> RobotdragonX, light green
<RobotdragonX> oh...*phew*
<BabSeed> swag
<Vordox> Oh well, rather ignore then being deductive... fine.. Don't evolve Yahooz =P
<Tovler> wait. what color was Vinyl's magic?
<RaveBrony> Im not saying his music is bad!
<RaveBrony> Its just... rather simple for my tastes
<Vordox> RaveBrony: Simplicity is the strong part for any music
<Vordox> RaveBrony: The simple songs are the one who stick in your head, not theother way around.
<Vordox> RaveBrony: So he is focusing ont he better backbone of his music, although some are required to listen to several times to get the feel of it.
<StinkomanFan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9K18CGEeiI Always a fan favorite
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Vordox> RaveBrony: Like I'm listening to Archie-Best Night atm, and I can hear he has alot of thought into it
<RobotdragonX> my dads going to make me go to prom.....i wont let him...bring it.
<AJfan77> What are you guys getting for christmas?
<Vordox> RaveBrony: However, he's using the same technique in musi for most of his music, so he's not really..."Swinging out" form the safe zone of trying his own style.
<RaveBrony> Shouldnt it be a surprise? lol
<CrystalPhoenix> AJfan77, cause you're expecting presents?
<Vordox> If I can say so. :P
<RobotdragonX> im getting portal 2 and overlord
<CrystalPhoenix> .....
<CrystalPhoenix> people these days
<Vordox> IS EVERYONE IGNORING ME?!
<Vordox> FINE!
<Yahooz> Im putting my money on one more http://soundcloud.com/archiemusic/krewella-alive-archie-remix
<AJfan77> CrystalPhoenix : If you don't like me, you don't have to reply to me.
<RobotdragonX> *pets Vordox*
<CrystalPhoenix> AJfan77, it's not that I do not like you. I just hate the whole view about presents in christmas
<RaveBrony> Where did Vordox go?? D:
<CrystalPhoenix> why are people expecting presents when christmas is about being together
<CrystalPhoenix> presents are nice and all but not mandatory
<RaveBrony> Cuz greed
<Yahooz> RaveBrony: maybe he rq'd because i /ignored him
<SirGanjalf> Twitcha Twitch Yay! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_05CTz1FbFs
<Yahooz> who knows
<RaveBrony> :L
<thelonepony|HW> I Love it when my cousins from Texas come for the holydays ^-^
<CountDoofus> Yahooz: Yeah, he figured as much you did that.
<Yahooz> CountDoofus: I wouldnt know XD
<AJfan77> CrystalPhoenix : Why though? I have two things I do in christmas, however you respect niether of them because atleast I BELIEVE IN JESUS!!!
<thelonepony|HW> naw, is that people expect gifts
<CrystalPhoenix> AJfan77, you believe in jesus fine, alright
<CrystalPhoenix> but would jesus be happy to see some greed on his holiday?
<StinkomanFan> I believe that in alternate universe this conversation isn't happening.
<RobotdragonX> AJfan77 /)
<IrNick> Wonder if Yahooz can hear me now. :P
<thelonepony|HW> Sillieh you
<thelonepony|HW> :P
<IrNick> I'm just not very fond of people who ignore other people when they were joking
<IrNick> It's like if you are at war with a country, just /ignore and nuke
<IrNick> Dem kinds
<Vordox> Also, going through all o Archie's music atm
<Vordox> and....errr...
<RaveBrony> Yahooz: This song I can get behind :P
<Vordox> "variation" is not what I would call it...
<Yahooz> Because Lyrics
<RaveBrony> I guess
<RaveBrony> Im more into 'Trance'
<Yahooz> He made on dubstep song, i would have no idea if you would enjoy it or not
<Yahooz> Oh trance eh?
<RaveBrony> I hate dubstep o_e
<Vordox> Yahooz: Link it
<Vordox> Yahooz: I'm intruiged
<Yahooz> yeah Archie is House/ Progressive House
<Vordox> Oh yeah...
<Vordox> ignored
<Yahooz> If you want trance, PinkiePieSwear is your guy
<Vordox> ._.
<twilight_sprinkle> orchestral music is my fav for the most, the more epic the better~
<Vordox> RaveBrony: mind tell him to /unignore me?
<Yahooz> epic violin is always cool
<RobotdragonX> you will defeat an evil overlord with the object right of you, what is it?
<RaveBrony> Yahooz: Vordox is asking if you would please unignore him :L
<twilight_sprinkle> i like the violin a lot, wish i had the patience to play it, but no chance there im afraid
<CrystalPhoenix> You guys know what time it is?
<Yahooz> Outside of pony music, Id recommend Armin van Burren, Ferry Cortsen, and some others
<RaveBrony> Yahooz: But yeah, like i said. Im not saying Archie is bad, its just not my taste in music :P
<Yahooz> for trance
<RobotdragonX> hammer time?

<RaveBrony> Vordox: Np :\
<Vordox> RaveBrony: Let him ignore me. =P
<Vordox> I don't care, atleast I listen to people with opinion rather then shun them
<Yahooz> Vordox: truth of the matter is ive had you on unignore the entire time

<Kandarihu> The only one I have on ignore is a troll who kept /msg'ing me swag once every second forever. You have to be THAT stupid to make it on my ignore list.
<Vordox> Yahooz|Dinner: Still, listened to about 10 songs of him.
<Vordox> But.. my ears cannot pick up the variation. =/
<thelonepony|HW> Kandarihu: Swaglestia?

<twilight_sprinkle> oh there was much rustling when it happened
<Kandarihu> Well I kind of violated my principles in using /ignore at all.
<twilight_sprinkle> i decided to sleep in that day unfortunately..
<thelonepony|HW> twilight_sprinkle: i wasnt there either
<thelonepony|HW> i missed it because of shitty internet ;~;
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt get much sleep either :\
<thelonepony|HW> next time, sleep earlyer then

<thelonepony|HW> Is that a stadium? LD
<Tovler> EverFree Radio tore into the new episode.
<thelonepony|HW> :D*
<alexxm> Sketch_Toku_Brony i heard the americans were going to try to make a lupin movie
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm huh sounds neat though america's history w/ some franchises were kinda meh
<Dark_Horst> so much babs seed music
<Dark_Horst> actually, i' confused
<Dark_Horst> how come there's so much remixes of that one song?
<alexxm> Sketch_Toku_Brony i think it could work i mean it's pretty simple to do 4 characters tryingn steal stuff one trying to stop them it's basically one of those old caper movies as a series
<SpeccyRush> 'cause there's multiple remixes of every song
<CrystalPhoenix> Dark_Horst, attention whoring
<CrystalPhoenix> people wants to be famous
<Dark_Horst> SpeccyRush: but there's nothing BUT that song lately
<Dark_Horst> that'S not normal
<CrystalPhoenix> and I do admit the song was the catchiest yet
<CrystalPhoenix> but yeah remixes now are stupid
<Dark_Horst> honestly? cant hear it anymore
<Dark_Horst> too much
<CrystalPhoenix> I say
<SpeccyRush> Dark_Horst: most recent song gets the most priority, besides all the other songs this season were remixed right of the bat too
<CrystalPhoenix> Original>every remixes and covers
<Tovler> I can't remember the crystal empire songs
<SpeccyRush> before the premiere aired
<Dark_Horst> oh well. maybe i just click those eqd links at the wrong times
<CountDoofus> Speaking of which, I just heard 3 different versions on Everfree Radio in the past 15 minutes.
<Vordox> SpeccyRush: Why not spend...time...quality?
<CrystalPhoenix> Dammit Larson why you spoil of next episode https://twitter.com/M_A_Larson/status/273210581299888128/photo/1
<Tovler> I'll check and see if the remixes even sound like the original.
<SpeccyRush> Vordox: hmm what now?
<Dark_Horst> still waiting for spikes death metal song. come on, somebody do that
<Dark_Horst> it was emntioned on stream
<Dark_Horst> you must do it
<Dark_Horst> it is law
<Vordox> SpeccyRush: Time and Quality on your songs instead of "pushing" them out?
<Tovler> Thanks, Mitch Larson -_-
<CountDoofus> Version 4...
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox has the right idea
<alexxm> Sketch_Toku_Brony if a lupin does get a movie who do you think will play who
<SpeccyRush> Vordox: don't ask me, I'm an artist not a musician :P
<Vordox> I'm nobody
<Vordox> =P
<CrystalPhoenix> SpeccyRush, those who rush to do their stuff shouldn't be considered artist
<SpeccyRush> and I'm not a rusher :S

<Dark_Horst> btw, that vid was on 9gag this morning. HOW'S THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?
<CrystalPhoenix> Hazard, only one picture can describe what I thought of the episode
<MLP_Brovakiin> Night alexxm :3
<CountDoofus> Night alexxm
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: NOW BURN THE WORK
<Tovler> It was cute and fun. I shouldn't feel that was about a bullying episode, but oh well.
<Hazard> I thought the song was awesome. That's pretty much what got it for me.
<thelonepony> HoodyNinja: okay >:3
*thelonepony burns the homework >:3
*HoodyNinja eats the ashes
<Hazard> Every year, I pile all of my homework in a compost bin and set fire to it.
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/163124
<CountDoofus> At least Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon got their just reward in the end. Happy about that.
<CrystalPhoenix> Hazard, this pretty much is the episode for me http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me2g7eixbK1r5el02o1_500.gif
<CrystalPhoenix> that's all I needed to love it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CrystalPhoenix: so daww :D
<Kandarihu> I wanted to like Babs Seed more than I honestly can. Maybe if my mind can create some scary headcannon or something.
<twilight_sprinkle> i like babs
<CountDoofus> Sweetie Belle, Y U SO DANG ADORABLE
<thelonepony> wait... nevermind
<twilight_sprinkle> she a good ponii
<Hazard> I freaking loved that song. I listen to ALL of the remixes whenever I can.
<CrystalPhoenix> .....yeah ok no
<CrystalPhoenix> I HATE the remixes
<twilight_sprinkle> funny, i dont even remember that song
<HoodyNinja> And no one noticed Dr. Whooves in a pear costume
<CrystalPhoenix> original>all remixes and covers
<HoodyNinja> CrystalPhoenix: I beg to differ
<HoodyNinja> Hold on
<CrystalPhoenix> No seriously
<Hazard> HoodyNinja: God the irony. And not to mention the polka dot bow tie. :D
<CrystalPhoenix> all remixes are rushed
<CrystalPhoenix> and I do hate the whole thing about remixes
<CrystalPhoenix> and how they are published in EQD
<CrystalPhoenix> it's like a race to fame
<Tovler> Someone make a Klezmer remix of Babs Seed
<CrystalPhoenix> disusting
<HoodyNinja> Dr. Whooves
<HoodyNinja> http://i.imgur.com/v00Kls.jpg
<Hazard> Anything that makes it to EQD is worth my time.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> HoodyNinja: lol man they hide them so well :D
<Kandarihu> Tovler, hmm, I think it can be done
<Kandarihu> Not sure if it should, though
<Tovler> I'll bring my clarinet
<Hazard> HoodyNinja: That's fucking awesome! I absolutely love the references.
<CCCP> Hi... :/
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh yeah Pears! i remember now :D

<Vordox> Tovler: Cloud Kicker doesn't have BROWN eyes
<Vordox> Or Lightbrown, as Derpy
<Vordox> Been trying to tell people about her for a few days now
<Vordox> But given up =P
<oni_link> CrystalPhoenix: Well yeah but I mean that she had a shot at a bigger role but then the soccermoms got offended
<Crono_brony> Hello everypony! How are you all? (I heard the video stream was hacked! what's up with that?)
<Tovler> Her waldo cameos were awesome in May the Best Pet win and that episode with the Smile Song.
<CrystalPhoenix> oni_link, cause you want Daisy to talk more?
<SnowCat> i just found this chat and i think its awesome ;w;
<Tovler> This shadow-of-a-doubt crap doesn't fly
<oni_link> hello Crono_brony
<JamesClydesdale> Hai
<CrystalPhoenix> you want any pony#12423542523 to talk more?
<JamesClydesdale> OFFLINE?! S:

<Vordox> If I only had 1080 or higher version
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: you sure its not the yellow haired pony thats 3 seconds later as the cabbage goes by?
<Vordox> I could take a better picture. :(
<JamesClydesdale> F*ck dis
<CrystalPhoenix> the show isn't about Derpy
<thelonepony|GTA4> stay for a bit
<FlutterDashBubble> :'( I want stream
<Crono_brony> oni_link: was it true that the stream was hacked?
<CrystalPhoenix> and she has nothing to offer to the main cast
<thelonepony|GTA4> its fun when there isnt a strea,
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> CrystalPheonix: It isnt?
<thelonepony|GTA4> stream*
<oni_link> Crono_brony: yup
<thelonepony|GTA4> Crono_brony: Hijack
<thelonepony|GTA4> it was hijacked
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: yeah thats not derpy
<Crono_brony> oni_link: Huh, why would somepony do that?! (ironically, the theme of the episode was bullying.)
<ShadowQuill> The real Pinkie is dead
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: How can you tell?
<oni_link> Crono_brony: yup
<ShadowQuill> Crono_brony: The hacking?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: the brown horse is near her during the high view, and then a few secs later when the cabbage goes by you can see them up close
<Vordox> GoldenBrown eyes, Grey colour body, and Golden hair
<Crono_brony> ShadowQuill: yeah.

<thelonepony|GTA4> Crono_brony: naw, it was idiots who are mad that we like a show that they hate
<CrystalPhoenix> once in a while it's cool but if the show is runned by fans it won't last long
<oni_link> CrystalPhoenix: Meh
<FlutterDashBubble> :O NOOO
<CountDoofus> Crono_brony: haters don't bother to understand us. Though, there are some bronies that don't know when to quit, giving us a bad rep.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: You... don't know how Waldo works do you? :P
<CrystalPhoenix> run**
<PinkiePop1234> :D yesssss
<Vordox> That's called a SCENE swap
<pony49212> 00,10refresh and or press play
<ShadowQuill> Vordox: CRAZY THEORY TIME! My guess is that Derpy being on the train in the intro means that she's not currently in Ponyville! Derpy is travelling the world!
<CrystalPhoenix> damn I hate my grammar
<CrystalPhoenix> so much
<FlutterDashBubble> :[ NOO!
<Vordox> urgh I give up...
<PinkiePop1234> :D yesssss
<Vordox> NEVERMIND, wait till a higher reso comes out and you'll see
<ShadowQuill> I will eat the trolls.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> My eyes! They see things!
<CountDoofus> Sumica SHTREEEEEEM!
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: what about waldo? shes the same grey pony with yellow hair thats in the next scene, which isnt derpy
<FlutterDashBubble> :) Your Funny. Im not there lol
<killerpony7733> Dat tank
<PinkiePop1234> YES
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox, there's a higher resolution then 1080p?
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: I don't know, I hope so
<FlutterDashBubble> <_< Uh nooooo...
<ShangaKhan> Hello!
<r-dash> i just got her whats wrong with the stream
<PinkiePop1234> Dude stop lying
<thelonepony|GTA4> A Sumica stream :O
<Vordox> I see the eye colour, hair colour and shape, AND Colour of the body
<Vordox> That's Derpy
<SpeccyRush> sumica: forgot to op?
<CountDoofus> Yay!
<sumica> 00,10hmmm woder when I dc'ed
<FlutterDashBubble> :P Lol
<sumica> 00,10no my auto op broke and cant figure out why
<FlutterDashBubble> I want stream :/
<oni_link> SO I think I know why there was an orange on that stream that day... I think it was a reference to this http://derpy.me/EmXoC
<Crono_brony> CountDoofus: Thing is, most of us aren't like that, I just hate how we are all quickly judged. We deserve a chance to show that we don't act like the way that they think we do.
<CrystalPhoenix> Vordox, or you want to see them so much you're hallucinating them?
<CountDoofus> FlutterDashBubble: hit Refresh
<Tovler> now she looks even more like Cloud Kicker in this video
<SpeccyRush> you're also missing a caital there sumica
<CountDoofus> Crono_brony: Amen.
<Vordox> CrystalPhoenix: No, I see them cause I am near sighted =P
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: you cant tell eye color on a size of that resolution
<sumica> 00,10ah what?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: I've been doing pixel work over over 15 years
<Vordox> I see pixels
*KrazyNoobs has joined the channel. GOD I LOVE RP.
<SpeccyRush> capital S sumica :P
<sumica> 00,10meh
<killerpony7733> sumi if most nights/midnight hours in woodman is gonna be the NC taking over everything it's gonna be fun
<ShadowQuill> I think that since the whole stupid "Gak" thing finally died down (for good I hope), it should not be an auto-kick. Remind me again why it still is?
<killerpony7733> Dat auto kick
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Hey everypony I'm back, finally
<sumica> 00,10cause people still bring it up
<HoodyNinja> Yeah, no one says gack anymore
<ShadowQuill> I HATE THAT BUCKING WORD
<CountDoofus> Until the next episode and its commercials. Then it starts right back up.
<CrystalPhoenix> still people brings it up
<Tovler> and then, it'll be in this week's commercials.
<KrazyNoobs> It will not be down during the show. When a g-k commerical comes on, people will start spamming like crazy. http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/29400000/Gak-is-Back-old-school-nickelodeon-29477838-631-463.png
<oni_link> welcome back AssertiveFluttershy1
<AssertiveFluttershy1> And it looks like somethings finally happening
<KrazyNoobs> shouldn't have posted that.
<ShadowQuill> STOP SAYING GAK
<CountDoofus> Haio AssertiveFluttershy1
<KrazyNoobs> That word was actually in the link, lol.
<KrazyNoobs> But really, gak is getting old.
<AssertiveFluttershy1> GAK!
<ShadowQuill> UUUGHHHHHHHHH
<oni_link> hahaha oh you guys
<Tovler> magical lycra?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: but still like i said, even if you can somehow see a ccolor of a pic thats such a small size, in the next scene you can see which pony it is
<KrazyNoobs> I'm stupid.
<FlutterDashBubble> :[ Spaaaaace
<KrazyNoobs> POOTIS
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Don't talk about Scene swap
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: unless you say they replaced her, which is unlikely
<Vordox> They did
<AssertiveFluttershy1> ouch that hurt
<CountDoofus> Is that THE AssertiveFluttershy, by any chance? The musician?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Nope
<AssertiveFluttershy1> sorry
<CountDoofus> Aww.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: and in the overview her eyes arent derped in any case, and frankly i dont see a yellow color. it could just be your eyes seeing things differently, that varies from person to person
<Tovler> they replaced here odd cameos like Pear Dr. Whooves and. Strawberry Shortcake Sparkler
<AssertiveFluttershy1> I'm assertivefluttershy1
<AssertiveFluttershy1> diffrent channel on youtube
<Tovler> either way, she looks purple
<Vordox> brb, I'm gonna see if I can get a higher reso screen
<Vordox> Gotta investigate
<oni_link> My stomach, she be rumbling. I'm waiting for my dad to finish making the lasagna ;3;
<HoodyNinja> oni_link: ;~;
<HoodyNinja> Dat feel
<ShadowQuill> Who was the worst troll this chat ever had?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: im looking at it in 1080 p
<meleeman> hi yo
<AssertiveFluttershy1> you
<HoodyNinja> ShadowQuill: We have trolls?
*oni_link hugs HoodyNinja
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i can upload a screen shot to imgur if you want
<meleeman> wacha´doing
<thelonepony|GTA4> oni_link: i know that feel ;~;
<ShadowQuill> AssertiveFluttershy1: I am hurt
<HoodyNinja> Probably the one that hijacked us saturday
<KrazyNoobs> Either my brother or moneymaster93alt2@tormail.com, the bloke who hacked this place.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: What colours are the eyes, and is the hair spikey?
<KrazyNoobs> Or claimed to have done so.
<ShadowQuill> HoodyNinja: Damn that /v/
<KrazyNoobs> IT WASN'T /V/
*oni_link also reaches out to hug thelonepony|GTA4
<Crono_brony> oni_link: Hopefully you get filled up from that. I just had thanksgiving leftovers. X3
<KrazyNoobs> It was /b/
<Kandarihu> Ah, Nanoha
<thelonepony|GTA4> okay, it cant be any 4chan boarders
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Bye the way guys what anime is this
<AssertiveFluttershy1> ?
<sumica> 00,10was not any of the chans
<oni_link> Crono_brony: I'll make it my mission to do so! XD It's just me, my dad and my nephew so I'm pretty sure I will :P
<sumica> 00,10it's a lame excuse for a stream site
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i think there might be one spike, but the eyes look grey
<KrazyNoobs> Okay.
<ShadowQuill>
<Vordox> Grey O.o
<AssertiveFluttershy1> ]
<AssertiveFluttershy1> \
<Vordox> Who has that colour setup...
<oni_link> sumica: so it was a rival stream?
<AssertiveFluttershy1>
<sumica> 00,10they have some regulars that frequent the chans and supposedly gnaa
<sumica> 00,10not rival
<AssertiveFluttershy1> What anime is this?
<thelonepony|GTA4> the other stream site was so jelly
<sumica> 00,10not even brony related
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Yay!
<prince-dari> During the ep pretty sure it was the GNAA
<oni_link> let me guess, they did it for teh lulz
<CountDoofus> I still don't understand what's with the slashes and letters. /v/, /b/, what have you... Someone feel like explaining it? :$
<sumica> 00,10part of them
<oni_link> I still don't get if the GNAA is srs or a troll group...
<AssertiveFluttershy1> I wonder what would happen if I mentioned..................
<AssertiveFluttershy1> gak
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: like i said, i can upload to imgur in 1080 p if you want
<CountDoofus> You get the boot.
<prince-dari> oni_link: Have you seen their full name, if so, what do you think?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Thought so
<meleeman> is like dlipping tables /v/ )) i___i
<Crono_brony> oni_link: perfect! yeah, you should be full. ugh, I just ate 'till i was full, and now mentioning lasagna (might of spelt that wrong. XD) makes me hungry again!
<meleeman> flipping
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> CounrDoofus: It's just the extentions used for the adresses of 4chan boards
<CrystalPhoenix> CountDoofus, in 4chan you have a little menu at top or bottom with all the board sort as /a/b/c/ and such
<oni_link> prince-dari: did a google search, nevermind :|
<CrystalPhoenix> for short we just use the slash and letters
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: That would be great, I got some zoom tools. :P
<Tovler> :( in Hearts and Hooves, zoomed-out Derpy definitely looked like derpy :(
<sumica> 00,10she never realised
<thelonepony|GTA4> oni_link: stupid name for a group, am i right?
<oni_link> Crono_brony: its cause lasagna is good food! :D
<oni_link> thelonepony|GTA4: very stupid

<AssertiveFluttershy1> da faq
<meleeman> were is the love;(
<Crono_brony> oni_link: Eeyup!
<CountDoofus> Oh, gotcha. Never ever been on 4chan, honestly. Seems like a "do not enter" zone to me.
<otakon> okay back
<oni_link> Crono_brony: /) for lasagna!!
<otakon> what's on stream sumica ?
*AssertiveFluttershy1 *sigh*
<CrystalPhoenix> CountDoofus, well yeah since it's anonymous so the replies are very raw
<sumica> 00,10nanoha
<oni_link> CountDoofus: its not for everyone honestly
<thelonepony|GTA4> CountDoofus: never go to that site if you're gonna be buthurt
<CrystalPhoenix> while there are rules, some people thinks they can do anything
<thelonepony|GTA4> trust me
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> CountDoofus: It really is a "do-not-enter" zone. I browse it because of obsession with internet culture
<AssertiveFluttershy1> What is this anime PLEASE!
<Crono_brony> oni_link: (\ FOR LASAGNA!
<meleeman> <CountDoofus> is a site full of cloppers and shippers
<sumica> 00,10best to not go to the site period.
<thelonepony|GTA4> ^
<sumica> 00,10the front door is a trap

<sub06905> thelonepony|GTA4: mind if i join the game? :3
<thelonepony|GTA4> eeyah?
<sumica> 00,10it was not hacking
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: The most common colour within the area is light purple...
<Kandarihu> I wanted to post a link to a 4chan thread that I think might go over well, but if there's a general concern about system security, I guess it would be a bad idea right now.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Of the eye.
<sumica> 00,10it was poor security on mips
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: heh told ya :P
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah with this size I could zoom into the very pixel depth
<sumica> 00,10the stream key can be seen externaly
<Vordox> And confirm, that is Cloud Kicker.
<meleeman> this new episode ... is gone to be just awsome ...i want to see trixy vs twilight
<sub06905> oi
<sub06905> spoilers
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm
<sumica> 00,10mind the spoilers there
<Dark_Horst> too late
<meleeman> lol sorry
<Tovler> Vordox: also, look at the exact first frame of Hearts and Hooves Day. It has zoomed-out Derpy and Cloud Kicker in it.
<[SWAG]Haku> Derpy and Cloud Kicker are friends :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: yeah, i thought they were grey on the smaller pic too tho, guess im more near-sighted than you, which is probably treue actually :D
<Bronysith> d
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<Kandarihu> Yesterday morning, I speculated about an upcoming episode while an ad for the season in general was streaming. Wrek kicked me, so I honorbanned myself for 24 hours. I held to that ban all the way through.
<Dark_Horst> but hey, already seen the title. and now i'm preparing for the big, fat, "HA! TOLD YA!" to throe into all your faces on saturday
*Bronysith glomps [SWAG]Haku
<Dark_Horst> it will be very satisfying
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Well, that's quite sad...
*[SWAG]Haku is glomped
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: I really mixed up the hair sticking to the eyes as golden. ;_;
<meleeman> did anyone see that video that a brony explain the real speed of rainbow?that was just awsome
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: yeah my brain did that too, i had too focus on the eye to unsee the yellow
<thelonepony|GTA4> ohai [SWAG]Haku :)
<Kandarihu> So meleeman, we take spoilers seriously here. A 24 hour ban is the PROPER discipline for spoilers.
<[SWAG]Haku> What up with the GTA4 thelonepony?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well on the other hand, i dont think anyone has managed to avoid spoilers for that ep
<thelonepony|GTA4> [SWAG]Haku: playing, but waiting for this ass to start the game :|
*DoctoDoctorWho engages terminator mode
<[SWAG]Haku> Bummer
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony|GTA4: since when can your pc handle gta 4 >.>
<thelonepony|GTA4> twilight_sprinkle: no, xbox
<sumica> 00,10So I did notice somthing with the hub ads
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, it doesn't make it alright to talk about it. You never know if someone has managed to avoid the spoilers or not.
<Dark_Horst> who plays gta 4 when they cna have planetside?
<DoctoDoctorWho> I hear spoilers, inform me so they may be eliminated
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonepony|GTA4: o okay
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am going to bed now, goodight everyone :)
<Dark_Horst> the New Lunar Protectorate needs YOU! *point*
<thelonepony|GTA4> Night MLP_Brovakiin :)
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight MLP_Brovakiin
<AdamTheDuck> and hello BronyState :3

<CountDoofus> Night MLP_Brovakiin
<[SWAG]Haku> HAKU HAS A QUESTION TO ASK Y'AL
<Dark_Horst> Do Your Part!
<sumica> 00,10such as the g3 face pinkie

<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai AdamTheDuck :3
<[SWAG]Haku> Should I drop the [SWAG] off of my name?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i know
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: *whispers* they need you cuz they suck.
<[SWAG]Haku> im tired of explaining it to people, and its even started to get to me now
<twilight_sprinkle> but maaan, i cant wait til new ep, eez gunna be soo awshum /)^3^(\
<thelonepony|GTA4> Ohai AdamTheDuck :3
<AdamTheDuck> [SWAG]Haku, it would be cool to, it's kind of annoying typing [swag] to tab your name :/
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm hmm
*thelonepony|GTA4 noms on AdamTheDuck :3
<Dark_Horst> DoctoDoctorWho: if only. my observations so far have shown that we are pretty much the only thing that makes the NC win SOMETHING
<twilight_sprinkle> this is probably the first time i actuallt cant wait for an ep
*AdamTheDuck licks thelonepony|GTA4 :P
<Dark_Horst> except the last two days
<meleeman> twilight_sprinkle: same bro/)
<DashWithRainbows> Naw, it gunna suk, twoiloight_sprankle.
<Dark_Horst> those were a miracle
<Dark_Horst> probably given by luna
<twilight_sprinkle> meleeman: (\
<[SWAG]Haku> Should I just be Haku then, or my usual online name of Haku1013?
<Kandarihu> sumica, it would be best for them to just joss us. Build up expectations one way and turn it all in a different direction. That's one of the things I like about One Piece.
<twilight_sprinkle> deeweearr pls, u gun eet dem words on saterday
<Vordox> MUSIC
<DashWithRainbows> YFW I can't eat.
<DashWithRainbows> :3

<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: everything okay?
<meleeman> there are rumors about they gonna put the episode in itunes this friday
<DashWithRainbows> Mmhmm.
<Haku> Nyeh
<DashWithRainbows> I was capable of freeing myself from 2 of my extra IT units.
<Haku1013> Nyeh
<sumica> 00,10yeah they had that rumor last week too.
<DashWithRainbows> I actually got some decent sleep.
<sumica> 00,10it was wrong
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: IT?
<Haku1013> burn
<Cypresswolf> Those moments when you have so much on your mind, you can't formulate a sentence without tripping over your own toungue when talking to someone -_(\
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dark_Horst: hmmph, I guess you'll just keep your heritical ways and I'll stay in celestias benevolent light.
<DashWithRainbows> Information Technology.
<DashWithRainbows> Computer stuff.
<meleeman> well the last episode was a little bit .. bad? beacuase it wastn what i spected
<Haku1013> -_-
<Haku1013> Well thats, like, your opinion, man
<Bronysith> meleeman: die
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Awww man you missed a glorious steamroll on amerish we basically won everything and conquered :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> meleeman: Naw, wwt wunt bad,
*AdamTheDuck licks Haku1013 :3
*Haku1013 is licked
<Cypresswolf> that was embarrassing
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: ah k. which reminds me, i should probably get back to writing this incredibly redundant code. by the time i fulfilled all the requirememnts it was 5 times longer than it has to be :\
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: next time i'll make time
<sumica> 00,10and then they declared a falt with the server cause clearly something is wrong when NC wins
<Haku1013> AdamTheDuck no longer has to type [SWAG] but now has to type 1013
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Well if we are gonna conquer most times around midnight or so EU time and all i'm definitely gonna be around
<J_E_Smith71> sumica: NC? Nostaliga Critic?
<Dark_Horst> killerpony7733: if some of the planetside-less sods in here would just download it, we could procure a small army
<Haku1013> Hmm
<meleeman> well i didnt say sooo bad is just not like one of the best episodes of all the fim series
<sumica> 00,10eww no
<Haku1013> My stream keeps dying
<AdamTheDuck> Nope, I can just type haku - then press tab to automatically complete it. :P
<DashWithRainbows> Well, you best get cracking on that work then, twilight_sprinkle.
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: kk, ttyl then :P
<twilight_sprinkle> imma just be afk
<DoctoDoctorWho> meleeman: ahem, eet wunt bad. I apolagise fer mah imprawpeh grammerz

<Haku1013> Yes, I know
<meleeman> DoctoDoctorWho: sorry doc but is a little bit difficult when you speak over 4 lenguajes at the same time
<J_E_Smith71> Oh wait
<Dark_Horst> it's nto even half the plane without it
<J_E_Smith71> You were talking about SciFi not here
<Kandarihu> Sailor Moon was the first Magical Girl Warrior.

<CriticKitten> Nonsense, Sumica. Syfy is AWESOME.
<sumica> 00,10hey killerpony7733 so was the IR scope working ok for yah on the rocket?

<J_E_Smith71> Sugar and Cream in Hot Water? Okay...

<Haku1013> ~yay~
<DoctoDoctorWho> killerpony7733: Thank you sir, I shall indeed put interest toward this. What say your opinion of the game in comparison to the Command & Conquer series?

<killerpony7733> sumica Else i generally don't do much infiltrator unless i wanna hack
<Haku1013> hmm?
<sumica> 00,10I might start investing in my heavy assault
<killerpony7733> DoctoDoctorWho What? you do realise the game i'm talking about is a MMOFPS?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: Opinions of the previous episode, "One bad apple"
<sumica> 00,10or max
<killerpony7733> sumica I may not have much cert invested to my classes yet but i have a ton of gear for them though due to my ummm SC >.>
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: ah
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought the last ep was awesome, had an important message that was well-delivered as well
<r-dash> yay
<CrystalPhoenix> jbh1145, I know that screamer
<twilight_sprinkle> screamers huh
<jbh1145> http://www.subliminalmessages.com/plane_charter_7b.htm
<CrystalPhoenix> jbh1145, stop it
<jbh1145> sry
<meleeman> twilight_sprinkle well thats a good point of view
<DoctoDoctorWho> killerpony7733: I apologize, from context it sounded much like you were refering to an RTS style game, at which I excell, and will proceed to kick Dovah's ass at once the oppertunity presents itself.
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah One Bad Apple did have some mixed reviews. Some thought it was fun, some poeple thought that the moral wasn't handled good enough, etc
<CrystalPhoenix> J_E_Smith71, I thought it was cute
<CrystalPhoenix> like out of this world cute
<J_E_Smith71> Same here
<CrystalPhoenix> illegaly cute
<sumica> 00,10CMC ep with song, it's a plus in my book
<killerpony7733> DoctoDoctorWho Ah but yeah the game that me sumi wrek and over 10 other bronystaters play is a MMOFPS game that is just huge.
<Kandarihu> Let me guess, car bomb?
<CrystalPhoenix> cool kill someone cute
<J_E_Smith71> Song was pretty dang catchy
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho, now how do you prepose to do that when you do not even OWN the game?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I thought it was rather boring but had a nice song
<CrystalPhoenix> and really
<CrystalPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/pK7xN.gif
<Tovler> I knew they wouldn't go hard in the paint in tackling bullying.
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: idk, i felt the moral was handled pretty well, altho it might have been a bit more clearer expressed in the end i supposed, by the main idea was delivered well enough imo
<twilight_sprinkle> jbh1145: so should i ignore you or you wont link screamers again?
<jbh1145> i wont
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: As said, once the oppertunity presents itself.
<jbh1145> does anyone remember me? i was on here before
<killerpony7733> jbh1145 Your name seems familiar but that's it
<jbh1145> oh well im pretty new here

<Dat1FuglyMuffin> jbh1145: Oh, then sorry... I was never here when you were. I guess Im thinking of someone else

<oni_link> hiyo SuperBrony64 ! <(~^_^~)/
<Cody> I forgot my sound was on max. owwwwww
<thelonepony> cachi01|kindamad: but its better than having long hair like i have at,
<Haku1013> So I was thinking the other day...
<Kandarihu> I sleep too much, and I'm not active enough. And I also wake up in the middle of the night with either a shortness of breath or gerd, so my sleep schedule is a mess.
<thelonepony> atm*
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I remember how I was so exhausted this one time, that I kept the video of Scootaloo G3.6 riding on her scooter for over 40 minutes on stream...before I woke up and stopped it.
<DashWithRainbows> That's a first then, Haku1013 :P
<cachi01|kindamad> thelonepony: but i loved mah long hair D:
<Dark_Horst> and that'S why we need to cut the earth in half
<Haku1013> And I realized that the film industry is going to be doing really well for the next few years
<Crono_brony> cachi01|kindamad: just had a haircut, i know that feel, bro.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Should do that again sometime soon.
<sub06905> SuperBrony64: :D
<SpeccyRush> lel, I remember that one SuperBrony64
<Dark_Horst> would eliminat e pesky timezones
<twilight_sprinkle> sumica: lul ikr, tough for night people to live in the worlds day-focused schedule
<SuperBrony64> 11,02...soon o-o
<oni_link> SuperBrony64: o,o
<sonicdude558> ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
<Dark_Horst> and our solar system would be the only one with a giant pair of boobs
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 This is why I tell you to go to bed
<cachi01> uhfdfd
<DashWithRainbows> Also
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DashWithRainbows: But...all mah bestest of friends are up ;^;
<thelonepony> cachi01|kindamad: I love long hair as much as you do, but do you want grease to build up on your hair?
<pony_6133> you guys should stream deathnote sometime
<pony_6133> one of the few animes i actually liked
<cachi01> thelonepony: as long as i have long hair
<Haku1013> Considering there's the new Marvel movies coming out, the Justice League movies, the new Godzilla series starting up, and the new Star Wars Trilogy.
<meleeman> pony_6133 i agree
<twilight_sprinkle> sumica: but yeah you should sleep if you feel the need, especially if you often dont sleep enough
<cachi01> thelonepony: plus it already did :I
<sumica> 00,10I remember this one time on stream where you went afk for 40 min and had noting but a still image streaming
<sumica> 00,10wait that was this morning
<thelonepony> ah
<cachi01> lol
<Haku1013> BURN
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 Well, it's their fault for being your bestest of friends then.
<Crono_brony> Haku1013: Dear Celestia, the year of the reboot.
<Bronysith> sumica: oi, what is this?
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah sumica you should try resting better on Fridays, instead of running the stream non-stop all night till the new ep and take a sleep break
<oni_link> You all should rest then :I
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<Dark_Horst> or just schedule a loooong playlist
<Kandarihu> I remember when Wrek had something running for 2 hours, and was asleep for the entire rest of the day with a dead stream.
<DashWithRainbows> Are y'all tryin' to say Ah need to rest, oni_link?
<meleeman> sleep you need to
<thelonepony> oni_link: rest is for the week
<thelonepony> weak*
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: is your nose stuffy?
<sumica> 00,10whip that 9yr old third grader
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DashWithRainbows: yeah!
<thelonepony> even for snorlax
<cachi01> ecchi ftw
<Haku1013> Chrono_brony not really, since theres only one reboot: Godzilla. And Godzilla has been rebotted twice now. The Heishie, Showa, and Millenium series are proff of that
<DashWithRainbows> No, Sith, you should know that I sometimes like to talk with a southern American accent.
<Dark_Horst> and that'S how japan was made
<oni_link> DashWithRainbows: Not you specifically but some of you sound like you really should rest
<cachi01> Haku1013: they are rebooting godzilla?
<cachi01> wut
<Haku1013> Yes
<cachi01> again?
<DashWithRainbows> I just never done it on Skype calls because I don't want you guys to remember my voice.
<Bronysith> DashWithRainbows: i was just wondering cause then i would suggest spicy food to clear it right up
<thelonepony> wait what? another Godzilla reboot?
<Dark_Horst> DashWithRainbows: why not?
<Haku1013> Legenary Pictures is teaming up with Toho to make a GOOD american Godzilla film
<J_E_Smith71> sumica: Then you'd be awake enough to run both Pet Shop and Aquabats (Though Aquabats seem to be in reruns)
<cachi01> Haku1013: yeah.....good luck with that
<Haku1013> Its coming out in 2014
<DashWithRainbows> Dark_Horst Same reason why I don't let people see images of me, I'm very... What's the word...
<cachi01> LPS is meh
<meleeman> um its vinyl_scratch channel open for some request?
<cachi01> nope
<DashWithRainbows> Timid?
*oni_link facepalms really hard, he JUST got DashWithRainbows' reference
<Crono_brony> Haku1013: not much to ask, and not to be rude at all, but can you please refrain from using the "h" in chrono? it just bothers me, crono just seems cooler to me.
<Dark_Horst> DashWithRainbows: paranoid B)
<sumica> 00,10yeah with the embed changes I probably will have to sleep more
<DashWithRainbows> Reference?
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: heh i kno dat feel

<Haku1013> hmm hmm
<DashWithRainbows> I made a reference?
<Haku1013> I for one look forward to the new Godzilla film
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Can I come and read you a bed time story sumica?
<DashWithRainbows> Ah, that's the word, Sith.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I betchya Im more paranoid!
<meleeman> @sumica you need to sleep over 8 hours all the day they said
<cachi01> I, for one, welcome our new giant building eater lazer shooter overlords
<Dark_Horst> hm?
<oni_link> DashWithRainbows: I think that was an AJ line from when she was applebucking all by herself. Maybe not though
<J_E_Smith71> I didn't think much of Pet Shop but having on with the chat last Saturday was sort of fun
<Haku1013> Theonly difference from the Japanese films is that Godzilla is going to CGI, but this time he'll have his actual, original design
<sumica> 00,10people say alot of things
<sumica> 00,10Arf is pissed
<Haku1013> HAKU SHALL NOW LEAVE MOMENTARILY

<Dark_Horst> it's a beast
<DashWithRainbows> You're implying I'm willing to steal a cactus, Joomay.

<CriticKitten> Why is Spyro in there?
<Ryunosuke> thelonepony: I know that but it still sounds like it should be a thing, like Apple pie, or Cerry pie....
<otakon> it's a game about action figures with action figures
<Deacon> CriticKitten because reasons
<thelonepony> Spyro is there?
<RainbowPie> J_E_Smith71: Its not that, It says "Loading the Justin.tv player in a fram is not allowed." Is it just be getting this?

<CriticKitten> An evil empire?
<CriticKitten> Never heard of that story plot before
<otakon> SuperBrony64: any chance you can lower the stream quality bc it is REALLY stuttery
<Deacon> remember, Empire = Evil, Kingdom = Good
<otakon> even putting twitch on low doesn't help
<CriticKitten> Also I was really hoping the villain would be Makuta
<TrixieMuffin> works fine here
<Deacon> you'd think there would be a good empire, but nope
<otakon> CriticKitten: needs a crash bandicoot crossover
<DoombringerZero> no stutter here
<meleeman> lol time to lose time
<thelonepony> Bit stutter here and there but good at my end
<oni_link> ha this is a cool concept imo

<Ryunosuke> I dont necisarrily subscribe to the notion that some names are better than others even though they mean the same thing, or otherwise represent the same thing simply based on the Disney effect
<otakon> CrystalPhoenix: um no
<Deacon> what did he say?
<thelonepony> Interview?
<otakon> I don't know
<Canadian_Brony> Hello everypony. Feels like it's been a while..
<otakon> my stream keeps stuttering too much
<otakon> hiya again Canadian_Brony
<thelonepony> Hi Canadian_Brony :)
<Deacon> allo Canadian_Brony
<oni_link> hey Canadian_Brony!
<Ryunosuke> ie. Empire is not necissarily evil and Kingdoms good, or Queens evil - Princesses = good
<CrystalPhoenix> Larson said, for background ponies, that the staff leave that field to us
<CrystalPhoenix> further note
<CrystalPhoenix> no BG ponies episode
<CrystalPhoenix> they focus on the mane 6
<oni_link> dang
<otakon> CrystalPhoenix: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Ryunosuke> or as NC said: "Princess? You are the defacto Femaile Ruler, Queen it up bitch"
<CrystalPhoenix> fandom fills in for BG Ponies
<thelonepony> Oh and Canadian_Brony, You where right about BL2 :D
<CrystalPhoenix> they really have to get a very GOOD reason to interact with the mane 6
<CriticKitten> Agreed with them. No need for BG pony eps. >_>
<Canadian_Brony> thelonepony ehh, I was?
<oni_link> lol dat one true pairing
<CriticKitten> Dat OTP
<CrystalPhoenix> but yeah that's the best thing cause think of it that way
<sonicdude558> hmm this song seems very familar
<CrystalPhoenix> do you want them to destroy your creativity field?
<Deacon> CrystalPhoenix well, makes more sense anyways, plus half the fun is making characters out of characters not in focus
<CrystalPhoenix> Bingo Deacon
<Ryunosuke> CrystalPhoenix: you mean like being brainwashed into guarding the exit to the cave where a certain princess and student are being held in order to prevent said plans from being messed up? :)
<sonicdude558> onoesmiiverseaaa
<CrystalPhoenix> Ryunosuke, most likely those have been random pony #x in the script
<CrystalPhoenix> they needed Ponies so they filled it with random ones
<Canadian_Brony> Ryunosuke more like "character development". They're letting us create who they are with nothing but a limited visual description.
<oni_link> dat reboot post
<Ryunosuke> Canadian_Brony: ahh i see
<CrystalPhoenix> unless the story boarders actually put some in intentionally
<sonicdude558> dat RD
<oni_link> sonicdude558: she ALWAYS dresses in style
<Ryunosuke> like.... Lyra and "Anthropology"
<sonicdude558> your mom and dad dress in style
<otakon> lol it's Hank
<otakon> OH YEAH!
<sonicdude558> honk honk amazing honks
<oni_link> lol
<CrystalPhoenix> Actually I'm boggling something kinda interesting for Vinyl-Scratch
<sonicdude558> now I want a WiiU
*superretroworld sonicdude558 always dresses in style
<CrystalPhoenix> it might be my only and very own headcanon but still
*sonicdude558 slaps superretroworld in the face
<oni_link> whoa dat mario party sound effect
<oni_link> again
<superretroworld> sonicdude558: hehe jk
<sonicdude558> oyeaaaaaa
<Canadian_Brony> sonicdude558 I've wanted a WiiU since it was showcased way back at E3. What I'm so shocked about is me wanting to get Black Ops II for it. I hate CoD!
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: wow that IS surprising
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Canadian_Brony: I hate CoD too but for some reason I always end up buying it
<otakon> SuperBrony64: it's gonna be A WHILE before you can level Tree Rex up
<sonicdude558> god the music reminds me of Lego Universe
<superretroworld> Dat1FuglyMuffin: same with tetris, i hate that game now, but i cant stop playing it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02otakon: How do you know?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: read the guide
<otakon> SuperBrony64: I only don't like this game bc it takes a real fortune to get all of the characters
<CriticKitten> You can interact with certain objects by PUNCHING THEM
<Jmo> Poor ass potato.
<Jmo> Eehehehe.
<Ryunosuke> Fluttertree? :)
<otakon> Jmo: dude you do realize it would take well over 200 bucks to get ALL of the figures right?
<Canadian_Brony> no Ryunosuke, otakon
<Jmo> And?
<otakon> Jmo: just NOT including the damn games themselves
<KrazyNoobs> GÃK
<Ryunosuke> well Flutterguytree? :)
<Canadian_Brony> No
<otakon> ...
<Canadian_Brony> otakon!
<KrazyNoobs> in the dark
<otakon> YOU NAMED HIM OTAKON!

<Rose`Maid> fuck sgt majors
<CriticKitten> That is definitely an otakon
<Ryunosuke> otakon: what do you mean... again?
<Rose`Maid> theyre dicks, and no one likes them
<sonicdude558> Dear Princess Celestia...
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten I thought it was an ota
<CriticKitten> >Gigantus
<CriticKitten> >not very big
<Ryunosuke> HULK SMASH
<oni_link> well, this game looks really really fun
<sonicdude558> dat cuz
<Deacon> he's a pygmy giant
<otakon> Canadian_Brony, Ryunosuke it happened before in Skyrim, he started a new character. Said the 6th poster will name him . I got kicked and spouted the usual "GODDAMMITDARIBOT!" and that was the charcacter name
<CriticKitten> A leg of lamb?
<Canadian_Brony> xD
<Ryunosuke> hehe
<sonicdude558> mario party
<oni_link> hahahaha

<Canadian_Brony> no
<CriticKitten> Welp there you have it
<Canadian_Brony> shotgun

<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 you may need to download some software to put a working .gif as your desktop background, but I wouldn't doubt it
<thelonepotpony> Bigcheese_: the color can only be use by the mods
<Phase4> well on windows yeah, on linux i can just paint over the root window

<VenHur> Guys, I think you had to use Firefox to solve the issue.
<CrystalPhoenix> or something earlier
<Canadian_Brony> "Animated gifs cannot be set as desktop background in Windows Vista or 7"
<Canadian_Brony> this computer runs 7

<SuperBrony64> 11,02VenHur: Yeah, I'm happy for the Wii U as well. The social features are still basic, but they are loads better than what the Wii offered. It's become more of a strong competitor to the Xbox 360 and PS3 than what the Wii could ever have done.
*Canadian_Brony then rocks out
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: hi
<SuperBrony64> 11,02wipergone2: Hai :)
<DerpyMuffins> Is the WiiU MLG tier SuperBrony64?

<SuperBrony64> 11,02DerpyMuffins: Yeah
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: can i add Shizuka
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: Nintendo Land is an...okayish game, my favorite attraction was the Mario one...but nothing else amazes me...
<Canadian_Brony> ooh, I feel light-headed..
<VenHur> SuperBrony64: New Super Mario Bros U would of been a MUCH better pick.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: I think going in between different menus, especially opening the Friend's list is a bit longer than I would have hoped for. There is a rumor though that they'll improve it in the next update along with adding Nintendo TVii
<thelonepony> Go to bread Canadian_Brony
<Canadian_Brony> thelonepony no, from headbanging
<thelonepony> ah
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I only played Nintendo Land once...it's fun but I've been having more fun with Black Ops 2 and New Super Mario Bros. U :)
<CrystalPhoenix> SuperBrony64, also how about those checkpoints in that Boost challenge in Sonic & AllStars Racing
<Canadian_Brony> something I haven't done for a while, seeing as how my mother refused to let my hair grow long enough for a year or so
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64 VenHur: Maybe it would have been better if they had a Kirby game in Nintendo Land: http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-11-16-449-Nintendo%20Land.jpg
<CrystalPhoenix> given that's more of Sega's fault
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CrystalPhoenix: Beat it :P ...though as for the game as a whole...it feels weird...it doesn't feel like the original anymore and for that reason I'm kind of put off by it :/
<CrystalPhoenix> CrystalPhoenix, the BOOST CHALLENGE?
<J_E_Smith71> SuperBrony64: At least the track designs are good
<Stallion_of_War> I knew, as soon as I saw the notification that Shizu was playing Audiosurf, that she would be streaming.
<CrystalPhoenix> Like the ones with NO CHECKPOINT
<CrystalPhoenix> AT ALL

<otakon> Shizuka: thanks for the stream :)
<AmericanTeaDrinker> AttackWithHugs that doesn't make sense as a joke. Why would this song make you horny?
<MahBoi777> twilight_sprinkle: Pinkie <3
<AttackWithHugs> I can't because this laptop is like 5 years old, has 2GB of RAM and probably can't handle it
<kirzstryfe> you could actually
<kirzstryfe> wow is about 8 years old at this point
<AmericanTeaDrinker> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> MahBoi777: k :P
<kirzstryfe> and the tech hasn't improved all that much in it
<AttackWithHugs> Plus my USB port is broken so it won't work anymore
<MahBoi777> XP
<twilight_sprinkle> your answer wasnt twilight though, so we cant be friends anymore
<MahBoi777> D:

*AmericanTeaDrinker stays focused on the plot
<Time> Picture
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Sorry.
<Kandarihu> Splash screen
<kirzstryfe> either way, I'd advise against wow just on principle, it's not a healthy game
<MahBoi777> oh myyyyy~
<kirzstryfe> and I speak from experience
<twilight_sprinkle> im not done perfecting my plot~
<Canadian_Brony> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> ,,,
<AdamTheDuck> Thanks for the lovely stream once again Shizuka. :)
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_sprinkle, you must perfect it, for your destiny is at stake
<Canadian_Brony> I checked in at the wrong time, didn't I?
<twilight_sprinkle> stream is over?
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Oh you actually are a girl, twilight_sprinkle? I was just guessing...
<AttackWithHugs> Whatever your destiny may be, I don't know.
<kirzstryfe> you're assuming there's a right time
<Time> or now
<Kandarihu> Is she done? She never said she's done
<twilight_sprinkle> AmericanTeaDrinker: nah :P
<Shizuka> 13is a good song to end on
<Shizuka> 13do not really have any video left to show
<AttackWithHugs> How so?
<Time> ah
<Kandarihu> Oh, okay. Thanks for the stream, then.
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Yes
<twilight_sprinkle> AttackWithHugs: i shall do it! !.!7
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Grazi
<AttackWithHugs> Thanks for the Audiosurf, Shizu!
<twilight_sprinkle> thx for stream Shizuka
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Grazi, amica mia.
<MahBoi777> thanks for the stream Shizuka
<kirzstryfe> it encourages addiction in order to keep people playing, there's always that next thing to do/get
<AttackWithHugs> >WoW an addiction
<kirzstryfe> I was a top end raider for about 3 years
<AttackWithHugs> >BronyState an addiction
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: wait does that mean we ran out of bill nye?
<AttackWithHugs> Which is healthier????
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<twilight_sprinkle> awwwww
<NocturnalBlade> Well that happened :P did i miss anything?
<kirzstryfe> neither technically, but with wow it tricks you into thinking you're actually accomplishing something
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Bill Nye :'(
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I never saw any Bill Nye :'(
<J_E_Smith71> Wait what happened?
<NocturnalBlade> what about Bill?
<Time> Sniff
<MahBoi777> awwww
<J_E_Smith71> Chat froze
<AttackWithHugs> Ohh
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Oh that's why I got kicked out somehow
<J_E_Smith71> What did Shizuka run through all the Bill Nye eps or something?
<AttackWithHugs> Welp, I won't be playing WoW for a bit. I needs moneys to buy it
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I never saw any :'(
<Canadian_Brony> complaining about it won't get you any
<kirzstryfe> trust me, at this point it's not worth playing either way
<MahBoi777> hey Canadian_Brony^^
<Canadian_Brony> hi MahBoi777
<kirzstryfe> the game has gone downhill in the last 2-3 years
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I wish I'd known about this site earlier.
<AmericanTeaDrinker> I just found this like 3 weeks ago on EQD
<Time> Weeks?
*MahBoi777 hugs AmericanTeaDrinker
<AttackWithHugs> Hm
<J_E_Smith71> twilight_sprinkle: What did Shizuka say before you posted? Chat froze and had to reload and I missed what you were saying earlier
<twilight_sprinkle> J_E_Smith71: that we ran out of bill nye
<LurkerBrony> http://tinyurl.com/5v9hsnm
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Oh NOW I know why its called tinyurl!
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Run a video of the Universe of Energy ride at Epcot that has Bill in it. That's one thing with him in that you haven't shown:p
<twilight_sprinkle> also J_E_Smith71 top tip, if chat freezes you can still use it by using highlighting to scroll up and itll refresh
<twilight_sprinkle> you can do that if you dont want to miss any conversation
<AmericanTeaDrinker> Thanks LurkerBrony

<aniderp> i dont hate it D:
<sub06905> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/315JiSYIqWL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
<TrixieMuffin> CrystalPhoenix: Pinkie : Gluttony , RD : Pride/Sloth , Rarity :Greed , Fire-Twilight : Wrath , Trixie : Envy , cant really place Lust atm , probably Molestia but cant seem to fit it into the mane 6
<Saturn> 08,01gallium! \o/
<SkunkTari> how come the limeV doesnt work for me?
<Saturn> 08,01i love gallium!
<aniderp> not broadcasting atm
<MadSurge> SkunkTari: it hates europeans apparently
<AdamTheDuck> :3 http://fav.me/d5288zv
<CrystalPhoenix> TrixieMuffin, I hought Applejack could be Wrath
*aniderp jumps all around the chat hyperly
*AdamTheDuck glues aniderp to the floor :3
<sub06905> hmm $26 for 15 grams of gallium
<CrystalPhoenix> and Envy maybe Fluttershy
<CrystalPhoenix> .....maybe
<aniderp> but double rainbow syndrom on
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: classy and fabulous~
<TrixieMuffin> CrystalPhoenix: if any id put her on Pride
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Bad Adam.
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah I considered that too
*AdamTheDuck duct tapes Jmo's hands together
<aniderp> im stuck to the floor ;_;
<CrystalPhoenix> then again fluttershy can be wrath
<CrystalPhoenix> since at the given circumstances she can be deadly
<CrystalPhoenix> and that would leave Twilight with Envy
<CrystalPhoenix> So Pinkie=Gluttony, Rainbow=Sloth, Rarity=Avarice, Fluttershy=Wrath, Twilight=Envy, Applejack=Pride, Celestia=Lust?
<Buytoast> How the hell is queen horse lust?
<CrystalPhoenix> Buytoast, either that or leaving Lust empty
<Buytoast> You people mixing canon with fanon again?
<TrixieMuffin> eyup
<CrystalPhoenix> unless you have a better suggestion
<aniderp> im still glued to the floor..
<Buytoast> Here's one.
<Buytoast> Nothing.
<CrystalPhoenix> then nothing it is for Lust
<TrixieMuffin> Cadence ?
*AdamTheDuck cuts the floor around aniderp so she can move
<CrystalPhoenix> lawl maybe
<AdamTheDuck> Problem solved :3
<aniderp> -hops around-
<Buytoast> Although I guess Buzz Buzz the Flying Love Bug would probably fit well enough.
<CrystalPhoenix> That too
<CrystalPhoenix> then again I kinda wanted the good guys to fit in the deadly sins
<TrixieMuffin> Miss Smartypants with wnat it need it spell
*TrixieMuffin pokes chat with a stick
<TrixieMuffin> Its dead Jim!
<gunny> is the stream on?
<gunny> oh, just the buffer show.
<gunny> Have some Dashie trolling Twi, then
<gunny> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us3Ic7sL-18#t=03m07s
<gunny> Watch the whole rracing scene XD
<aniderp> but im listening to september pmv
<CrystalPhoenix> I don't really enjoy the fact that "trolling" replaced a bunch of words
<sub06905> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaMWxLCGY0U
<gunny> what word are you looking for, CrystalPhoenix ?
<Pokecolt> Hi guys. :)
<CrystalPhoenix> gunny, what do you mean
<CrystalPhoenix> I just hate how "trolling" is now part of the general english vocabulary
<gunny> CrystalPhoenix: about trolling
<gunny> what of it?
<CrystalPhoenix> it's a stupid word
<Pokecolt> They see me trolling, they hatin'.
<Pokecolt> I always thought swag was a stupid word too crystalphoenix.
<Pokecolt> :P
<CrystalPhoenix> like what happened to joking
<CrystalPhoenix> swag is another horrible word
<gunny> it is. XD
<Pokecolt> Yolo as well.
<CrystalPhoenix> What is becoming of this world.....
<gunny> yep
<CrystalPhoenix> first epic
<XAX> swog4lyf
<CrystalPhoenix> then trolling
<SkunkTari> i have never heard of the word yolo until now
<SkunkTari> XP
<CrystalPhoenix> now yolo or swag or anything the teenagers say these days
<Pokecolt> Yolo is said a lot here.
<gunny> it is. :P
<AdamTheDuck> You obviously love Octavia :3
<Pokecolt> It's ironic when people playing video games say yolo.
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: Ah. The days of "Epic win/epic fail/etc" on the Internet...
<Pokecolt> "You only live once" as they are playing video games.
<gunny> inb4 everypony is trolling
<CrystalPhoenix> but yeah trolling.....why can't it be joking or harassing
<CrystalPhoenix> or any words involving a person making fun of another
<Pokecolt> Where did the word trolling come from is my question. x3
<CrystalPhoenix> what happened to those words?
<CrystalPhoenix> OH WAIT
<CrystalPhoenix> Everypony forgot about them and replace Trolling
<CrystalPhoenix> nvm
<Pokecolt> So, let me ask a question. How many people swear here? :3
<CrystalPhoenix> replace them with trolling**
<Pokecolt> Cause back in the day, swearing like, never occurred, and when you did swear.
<gunny> because its the internet CrystalPhoenix
<Pokecolt> You were frowned upon.
<CrystalPhoenix> gunny, not only the internet
<Saturn> 08,01i love squeakybelle
<Pokecolt> Now it's everyday language,
<Saturn> 08,01best VA
<CrystalPhoenix> we hear trolling everywhere now
<CrystalPhoenix> outside and everything
<gunny> XD
<aniderp> sweetiebot
<SkunkTari> trolling is the new norm it seems
<Pokecolt> Just to check, nothing is being streamed right now, right?
<CrystalPhoenix> yes and I do not like it
<SkunkTari> trolling is dumb and irratating
<gunny> i sprayed axe in my mouth
<gunny> x///x
<sub06905> lol
<XAX> The reason it's called trolling, is because the English verb "Troll" means 'to slowly drag a lure'.
<Pokecolt> I always thought axe smelled like bug spray a lot.
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX what?
<XAX> pronounced "trawl" I think.
<CrystalPhoenix> isn't Troll a fantasy creature?
<CrystalPhoenix> your definition is from the internet buddy
<sub06905> dont they live under bridges?
<CrystalPhoenix> 4chan to be precise
<SkunkTari> tf2 is full of mic spammers and trolls
<gunny> XD
<XAX> But what trolling used to be was, as the English definition means, slowly dragging a lure and them the person finally realizing they're being trolled.
<Jmo> 'I sprayed axe in my mouth' Do you have a brain of a peanut
<XAX> now, most people just think of "EPIC TROLL XD"
<Phase4> k, you guys should be getting stream
<SkunkTari> when 3 people are spamming over each other with saxton and other crap, major ear rape
<XAX> Jmo: He's just trolling XXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<Jmo> Don't ever, do that again.
<Phase4> you guys getting stream?
<Jmo> That face is the most retarded face ever.
<XAX> Phase4: no because I'm in he'd
<XAX> BED
<XAX> IM IN BED
<XAX> Jmo: yes sir
<SkunkTari> i got stream now
<Phase4> HE'D, THE NEW BED
<CrystalPhoenix> XAX while I do see your point of the original internet meaning of troll you're missing an important point to put it outside of the internet
<Jmo> Good kiwi.
<XAX> and phase quitted
<CrystalPhoenix> with a quick search I see now that troll is actually a FISHING verb
<Phase4> 00,02test

<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, not many
<JRP2234> i think Project 64 is ded
<Phase4> 00,02i forget what its called but there is one in development now
<Phase4> 00,02project 64 is long dead
<AdamTheDuck> Uhh, feeling a little sick again, might head off to sleep early again

<Phase4> 00,02my little dashis is that verry blunt kind of sad
<CrystalPhoenix> or even the End of Ponies
<CrystalPhoenix> even though I haven't read it yet
<Saturn> 08,01"knock knock, who's there? it's my cock" <-- misfits. so classy.
<ptrwager> :'( stop talking bout little dashie
<CrystalPhoenix> but it look like sob material
<Buytoast> you mean Word Word word: The Fan Fiction?
<sub06905> Saturn: :D
<CrystalPhoenix> well Buytoast isn't a fanfic filled with words?
<Buytoast> well yeah
<Buytoast> but that end of horses thing
<Cypresswolf> stream window keeps buffering for me :S
<Saturn> 08,01i love horses
<Buytoast> that's something that makes a dictionary say damn
<Saturn> 08,01they're so large and lovely
<Saturn> 08,01they're like GIANT DOGS
<CrystalPhoenix> I enjoyed Background Pony even though it's pretty wordy
<ptrwager> i need to watch MLP:FiM from the start anypony know a good download site?
<Buytoast> you know what
<SkunkTari> mld is better
<Buytoast> i'm going to write a story
<CrystalPhoenix> ptrwager, Youtube
<Buytoast> and it'll be sadder
<Buytoast> badder
<Buytoast> and better than anything else
<CrystalPhoenix> Buytoast, that would be neat
<CrystalPhoenix> and no SkunkTari MLD is horrible
<SkunkTari> i loved the dashie story
<Saturn> 08,01MLD is not very well written
<CrystalPhoenix> there are WAY BETTER and even sadder fan fiction than that......joke
<Saturn> 08,01hey ptrwager
<ptrwager> ???
<Buytoast> maybe i can convince it to get on Sir Dragontickler's Warsol of Peevish Equines
<Saturn> 08,01ptrwager: youtube has all the episodes
<Buytoast> hell, i already got some garbage on there before
<Saturn> 08,01Buytoast: hahaha
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<ptrwager> i hate my router
<SkunkTari> im gonna say it that my little dashie is the best fic i have ever read
<ptrwager> :'(
<SkunkTari> and its not badly written
<Cypresswolf|Insomnia> :| I hate Vista SO MUCH :[
<Buytoast> shit, warsol isn't even a word
<Pokecolt> Cupcake song + dubstep/techno music in background = awesome. x3
<Pokecolt> Pinkie pie sounds good autotuned.
<Saturn> 08,01SkunkTari: heh, you've not read many fics then
<SkunkTari> Saturn: i have read cupcakes and other fan fics
<Buytoast> that sounds like some rejected Shel Silverstein book
<SkunkTari> i have read the Vegabond one too
<Phase4> 00,02eating my gun
<Buytoast> "Cupcakes and Other Fan Fics: Tales from the Abyss and Somehow Further Down"
<Saturn> 08,01SkunkTari: yeah, cupcakes ain't all that good either
<SkunkTari> i have read at least 5 and more fan fics
<SkunkTari> my top fan fic is MLD
<Buytoast> b-b-but Saturn! it has scary parts and it's known by people!
<Buytoast> it has to be good!
<ptrwager> 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01romance reports is a fantastic (NSFW) fanfic
<Saturn> 08,01Macintosh is brilliant too (SFW)
<Saturn> 08,01Fallout: Equestria
<SkunkTari> did you even read those fan fics saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01SkunkTari: i did
<SkunkTari> mld and cupcakes
<Saturn> 08,01i've read tons of fanfics
<Canada_Brony> MAYO/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
<CrystalPhoenix> Saturn, have you had time to read Background Pony?
<Buytoast> hell, i used to read fan fics too
<Buytoast> until they started become self insert oc fantasies
<Buytoast> well
<Buytoast> more often
<ptrwager> yea then it just gets creepy
<CrystalPhoenix> and SkunkTari here's why MLD is horrible http://onemansponyramblings.blogspot.ca/2012/07/6-star-reviews-part-85-my-little-dashie.html
<Saturn> 08,01CrystalPhoenix: I did, aye
<ptrwager> good song
<SkunkTari> Not gonna click that link because its their opinion
<CrystalPhoenix> Saturn, you read it all?
<CrystalPhoenix> SkunkTari, it's an analysis
<Saturn> 08,01i've read most of it
<Saturn> 08,01i do like Lyra stories
<aniderp> back
<SkunkTari> CrystalPhoenix: still an opinion
<aniderp> and i fell on my floor ;_;
<Jmo> Welcome back aniderp
<Saturn> 08,01i read this NSFW one about ehr and a human
<Jmo> how .-.
<aniderp> well..
<Saturn> 08,01it was quite well written
<aniderp> i lost balance
<Saturn> 08,01oh! read Celestia's Teeth!
<Saturn> 08,01it's hilarious!
<RawketLawnchair> Soilder must go, his people need him
<CrystalPhoenix> and what have you thought of Background Pony so far beside the fact tht it's Lyra?
<SkunkTari> if its so badlt written, then why are people crying when they finish the story
<SkunkTari> *badly
<CrystalPhoenix> SkunkTari, because it got popular for one concept only
<CrystalPhoenix> owning a pony
<Buytoast> because people will cry at anything that'll go for a cheap cry
<CrystalPhoenix> which is a fantasy for most bronies
<SkunkTari> XP really?
<SkunkTari> owning a pony?
<Saturn> 08,01SkunkTari: because people have no taste
<Buytoast> that too
<CrystalPhoenix> and yeah add Buytoat and Saturn points
<SkunkTari> and what would that be hmm
<Canada_Brony> hmmmmmm
<RawketLawnchair> http://i.imgur.com/sGCe4.jpg
<SkunkTari> what kind of taste dont they have?
<Saturn> 08,011) people have bad taste, 2) people have a fantasy of owning a pony/having a daughter
<Buytoast> i could write a shitty story that ends with something sad
<Buytoast> and get people to cry
<Buytoast> does that make it good?
<SkunkTari> maybe
<Buytoast> are you le serious?
<CrystalPhoenix> SkunkTari, analysis, not being gullible, actually thinking
*Saturn 08,01wants a daughter
<RawketLawnchair> Saturn: Sure, you can have one. . .but you get Babs sEed.
<CrystalPhoenix> I wouldn't mind having a kid and tell that kid my philosophic rambles
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha ha.
<SkunkTari> i personally think it was very well written and had a very good backstory
<Buytoast> i dont want any kids
<Buytoast> spending my life with 5 siblings has demonized children for me
<Saturn> 08,01RawketLawnchair: i wouldn't mind Babs Seed as a daughter
<CrystalPhoenix> SkunkTari, WHAT BACKSTORY
<Buytoast> BACKSTORY?
<Saturn> 08,01i'd train her up to have a scottish accent
<CrystalPhoenix> It had no backstory whatsoever
<Buytoast> IN CRY LITTLE DASHIE?
<CrystalPhoenix> we don't even know the guy at all
<CrystalPhoenix> he was nothing, noone
<CrystalPhoenix> he was bland
<Buytoast> oh man, you made me bust a gut there
<SkunkTari> im not gonna talk anymore about it since you guys are being assholes about it now
<CrystalPhoenix> which actually is a cheap way to sink the reader in
<MadSurge> Saturn: So you like Babs? :3
<SkunkTari> so what the fk ever ok
<Buytoast> easier to connect it with yourself if the protagonist has no character
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: she was adorable
<CrystalPhoenix> Exactly Buytoast
<Buytoast> but she was a demon seed Saturn
<Phase4> 00,02what the heck happened to voice chat
<CrystalPhoenix> MLD is also filled with plot-holes
<Saturn> 08,01she was okay by the end of it
<MadSurge> Saturn: finally a "villain" gets the chance of redemption :)
<Buytoast> this is audio from that one video
<CrystalPhoenix> IS THIS THOSE FLIM FLAM DRUNK SINGERS?
<Buytoast> where the drunk guy sings the flom flem song, aint it?
<SkunkTari> Stop talking about MLD already since its SO BAD
<SkunkTari> wha wha whaaaaaa
<RawketLawnchair> That couch ain't goin' no where.
<Saturn> 08,01 i just want to say
<ptrwager> waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<ptrwager> keep crying baby!
<ptrwager> :[
<SkunkTari> XD
<Saturn> 08,01Misfits this season is *really* 18+
<Saturn> 08,01so i'm not gonna stream it

<Saturn> 08,01sppoilers?
<Saturn> 08,01where?
<Bronysith> Oi, Jaymo, what are you doing?
<Jmo> What do you want?
<CrystalPhoenix> but serious talk SkunkTari and that's my final word on this. There are WAY more fanfiction out there that are better written than MLD
<aniderp> i lost balance.. thats how
<Saturn> 08,01^
<Saturn> 08,01there's some really really good fanfics out there
<CrystalPhoenix> You may enjoy MLD if you want sure but seriously don't put it at the top of your list
<RawketLawnchair> MLD is just 'm-muh feels ;_;
<SkunkTari> CrystalPhoenix: i dont fking care anymore ok
<CrystalPhoenix> it really doesn't deserve the attention it has
<Bronysith> ugh
<Bronysith> What
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Bronysith> is the big deal with my little dashie?
<RawketLawnchair> Could easily replace Dash with any pone and it'd be the same story.
<CrystalPhoenix> and those were my final words, if you won't mind I have to take a shower
<Bronysith> ^
<sub06905> just over rated
<SkunkTari> i said i dont wanna talk about it

<AJIsAwesome> DarkColt: No earth? :<
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<DarkColt> Nope
<AJIsAwesome> Okay. :3
<DarkColt> I love flying, and I love magic
<DarkColt> In every game available, I've always played the mage/warlock/magic user
<DarkColt> And with that, I always tend to gravitate towards flight/speed related spells, or like in Halo 4, use the Jetpack
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, I've always went for the sneak, theif-like characters...
<weeping_pegasi82> I've always been the assassin type too, but sometimes I go for brute strength
<AdamTheDuck> Usually with a tad of magic if I'm not playing saneak.
<weeping_pegasi82> da magics!
<AJIsAwesome> Has The Wizard ever been shown here?
<DarkColt> 'dat pew pew
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome, according to http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/past-movies/ nope
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, AdamTheDuck. :)
<AdamTheDuck> broken glass?
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm so broken Vinyl goggles
<DarkColt> After I watch ponies, I have to figure out if I should play Halo 4, or Dungeon defenders.
<weeping_pegasi82> crystal vinyl is best pony
<DarkColt> Actually, I probably need need to play Halo 4
<AdamTheDuck> Be a bass and play both at the same time :P
<DarkColt> New Spartan Ops Episodes :P
<DarkColt> AdamTheDuck: Homahgurd, genious!

<Habubuman> Darkcolt, did you play the halo's b4?

<Habubuman> ehh
<AdamTheDuck> Dedication*

<Habubuman> multiplayer that is
<Habubuman> i think they have made it into cod mini :/
<Spamish2> I did'nt play halo but a friend said the multiplayer looks like cod too.

<AdamTheDuck> Kill streaks in Halo 4?
<Habubuman> orr
<weeping_pegasi82> bye Jake
<AdamTheDuck> ...
<Habubuman> not exakely
<Habubuman> when you have killed some people you get a bonus like a wepon or bost
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 Halo 5 is made in the next half year and added iron sights feature...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ^^
<Habubuman> -.-'
<Habubuman> wow
<Habubuman> ..
<Habubuman> really?
<Habubuman> you are joking right
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Killstreaks don't mean that I ain't MLG in it! >: D
<AdamTheDuck> Halo with iron sights... I would go jump off a cliff.
<Habubuman> pls xD
<Spamish2> (I'm not sure, i did'nt play), but it look like cod because of weapons (like cod, you are stonger with better weapons with lvl up)
<Habubuman> well true but i miss when halo was it's own game and not coping some other gaes :/
<AdamTheDuck> Wait...
<Habubuman> *game
<AdamTheDuck> Levels affect gameplay now?
<AdamTheDuck> Wat.
<Habubuman> yea
<AdamTheDuck> I stopped at Halo 3, so excuse me ;~;
<Spamish2> Nope, but a friend said lvl up = better weapons = ...
<Habubuman> that is true to
<Habubuman> i have played online and the more you play the better guns you get
<Habubuman> soo
<Habubuman> yea...
<AdamTheDuck> At this rate, I don't think I'm ever going to try another Halo...
<Habubuman> yea but!
<weeping_pegasi82> they need to make a battlefront 3
<AdamTheDuck> Although ODST was fun when I was over at a friend's.
<Habubuman> the campain is actually good in my oppinion
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> weeping_pegasi82, ...
<weeping_pegasi82> :$
<Habubuman> but well master chif is not a emo anymore in the campain xD
<AdamTheDuck> You don't know how many times I've waited on news about that
<Habubuman> *chef
<Habubuman> or waht ever he is spelled xD
<AdamTheDuck> only to get it shut down for some apparent reason...
<AdamTheDuck> Chief I think
<Habubuman> i dont really trust 343 industries :/
<Wrek> 05halo has been a dissapointmentsince combat evolved
<Habubuman> yea thats it ^^
<AdamTheDuck> too lazy to bother in this slow morning of mine
<weeping_pegasi82> if they kept the thing that made battlefront 2 so good and just improved upon that without turning into star wars cod then I would be happy

<Spamish2> All 6mane are best pony
<Spamish2> manes*
<Habubuman> Âj i think but i like them all
<Habubuman> *Aj
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Twilight is best pony (and Chrysalis)(And Luna)
<weeping_pegasi82> Luna is best princess
<ChaosDuck> If you are voting only one pony
<weeping_pegasi82> Applejack!
<Habubuman> i like luna to but we hardly see her :/
<Spamish2> Fluttershy :(
<Habubuman> putting your hoff down! :D
<ChaosDuck> *hoof
<Habubuman> thx
<Habubuman> my english is not that good :/
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I like Twilight alot mainly because I act like her...alot
<weeping_pegasi82> woo! reading!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Been playing Paper Mario Sticker Star alot lately
<ChaosDuck> So far AJ has 2 votes, Luna has 2 votes, Fluttershy has 1 and Twilight also has 1
<Habubuman> but we cant compare the mane 6, they are all good. :)
<Habubuman> in my oppinion atleast
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Derpy is best background pony :3
<weeping_pegasi82> but we can compare background ponies
<ChaosDuck> Well lets talk about the new episode.
<weeping_pegasi82> OCTAVIA!!
<St-Timid> AJ is best background pony
<Habubuman> :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> When is Octavia going to show up?
<ChaosDuck> any ponies are allowed in the vote
<AJIsAwesome> St-Timid: :D
<weeping_pegasi82> St-Timid: eeexxxccuuuuuussse me?
<AJIsAwesome> ChaosDuck: New one or newest one?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Give her time..... :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im so curious who they're going to get to voice octavia
<naturesfury> they should make an episode where its nothing but background ponies
<weeping_pegasi82> no spoilers!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> She better sound fancy
<St-Timid> :I
<Spamish2> Plz no spoilers
<naturesfury> i mean there the main cahrs full with lines and everything
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm trying to stay spoiler free for the rest of the season
<Wrek> 05no talk about unaired S3 episodes
<Wrek> 05talkign about them is a ban
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Kay
<weeping_pegasi82> I failed miserably for the first two episodes
<ChaosDuck> We're not spoiling.
<Habubuman> but can we talk about the episodes that are allready out?
<ChaosDuck> Yes
<Habubuman> i thought so ^^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Did Live have a issue? or are we using a new streaming thing for no reason?
<weeping_pegasi82> SpadeMagnes[School]: mips was hijacked it's not secure anymore
<ChaosDuck> Is bronystate fixed?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: LiveV doesn't work for everyone.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh
<AJIsAwesome> ChaosDuck: It was the live stream that was hijacked, not bronystate.
<ChaosDuck> Okay
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dont know about the rest of ya'll but I fucking love Sticker Star
<Buytoast> Sticker Star is a terrible Paper Mario game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Screw you
<Buytoast> i didn't say it was a bad game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its better than Super Paper mario, even though I kind of found that fun....
<Habubuman> well i am out, have a great time everypony! cya :)
<Buytoast> i said it's a terrible Paper Mario game
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Habubuman. :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Buytoast: Its better than Super anyway
<Buytoast> at least super had partners
<Buytoast> and let you choose what to attack
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh stop bitching about that
<Spamish2> I loved the old paper mario, but sticker star have'nt the same gameplay ?
<Buytoast> you don't get partners
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never used the partners that often anyway, I used one and that was it
<Buytoast> you can't choose what to attack
<HolyPony> boom im back
<Buytoast> you have to rely on stickers to attack
<Dovapony> i would like to exuse my spam
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its called experimenting..
<weeping_pegasi82> OH COME ON!! dumb adobe crash
<Buytoast> which means if you have no money or crappy stickers you won't win
<Dovapony> i did....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You should have no excuse to not have stickers
<Buytoast> bosses usually have some gimmick to beat them you wouldn't see unless you lose to them at least once
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Or money
<Wrek> 05so far so good
<Dovapony> im currently using proxy
<Dovapony> and.... i dont want too
<weeping_pegasi82> woo hoo
<Dovapony> but
<Dovapony> my ip got banned from chat
<Buytoast> you're using a proxy to avoid a ban?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You can run from any fight anyway
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Buytoast> OH BOY
<Dovapony> could i please be unbanned? i was lol spamming :( im taking responebility and wanting to be unbanned v_v
<ChaosDuck> Which theater was hijacked?
<Buytoast> you can run from a fight, that won't help when you can't advance in the game because you need a specific sticker
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They arent that hard to find
<weeping_pegasi82> ChaosDuck: the stream was not the theaters
<AJIsAwesome> ChaosDuck: Not theater, just the livestream.
<ChaosDuck> Okay.
<weeping_pegasi82> the theaters all have the same stream
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<ChaosDuck> Oh.
<ChaosDuck> I'm new to this.
<Buytoast> they may not be hard to find, but that's a stupid way of extending the game
<Buytoast> hell, thing stickers are terrible
<SpadeMagnes[School]> <.<
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its called experimenting..good god
<Buytoast> if they were something like the crystal star power meter thing then they'd be good
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Every time some game tries something new they bitch
<AJIsAwesome> ChaosDuck: Make sure to read the Rules and FAQ while yoju're here. :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> When they dont try something new they bitch
<Buytoast> but having to run around the map constantly trying to find one sticker to beat a guy is a pain in the ass
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MAKE UP YOUR MIND
<Buytoast> with paper mario they didn't need to change
<Buytoast> but they did anyways and created bad shit
<ChaosDuck> Who's going to get the new Farcry game!
<Buytoast> but the third boss is nice
<Buytoast> specially with how he attacks
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I liked how the boss clapped to the music
<Buytoast> that's what i'm talking about
<ChaosDuck> Who's getting FarCry3?
<Buytoast> that was good stuff
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back for 5 minutes........i've heard before left that MadSurge was in pain.......or it was SpadeMagnes[School]?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Me
<Buytoast> but that fight was also shitty because the thing you need to actually stand a chance is so far off
<Dark92Enigma> oh
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeMagnes[School]: what happened?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not sure if Mad was... didnt see what he said
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: what happened? D:
<ChaosDuck> Is there a fight going on?
<Dark92Enigma> nope
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Dark92Enigma: Had my toenails ripped out to get rid of a ingrown and an infection
<MadSurge> I am fine
<AJIsAwesome> ChaosDuck: Nope. Discussion.
<Buytoast> and you have to agree SpadeMagnes[School]
<Buytoast> Kersti is useless
<Buytoast> outside of that stupid spin gimmick
<MadSurge> ChaosDuck: and games discussions
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeMagnes[School]: :O
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yea...not as interactive as Goombario/Goombella
<ChaosDuck> SOMEONE ANSWER MY QUESTION
<Buytoast> the help is nothing
<Buytoast> no one is gertting far cry
<Buytoast> its bad
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeMagnes[School]: and i thought it was just for walking too much.....
<ChaosDuck> FarCry isn't bad.
<Spamish2> far cry.....hu, no
<MadSurge> ChaosDuck: but we did answer!
<ChaosDuck> It's quite good.
<Dark92Enigma> ok, brb after lunch.......get well SpadeMagnes[School]
<Buytoast> honestly, if they had made the thing stickers just some sort of meter thing rather than have you have to go and either buy em or track em down again i'd be fine with it all
<pony_6124> gak gak
<ChaosDuck> no
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Again you have no excuse to not have stickers, they're everywhere
<Buytoast> i'm not talking about the shit little stickers
<Buytoast> i'm talking about the 3d item ones
<Leonid> Twitchy-twitcha, twitcha-twitch:O
<ChaosDuck> How do you reply to someone?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never used those that often in battle except for bosses
<Kandarihu> That's sad. A fellow Tennessean coming on, just to spam that which must not be named
<Buytoast> that's what i mean
<Buytoast> you need specific ones to fight the bosses or interact with certain things
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You only need like 1 or two per boss
<Buytoast> but I shouldn't need to purposely lose a fight just to figure out how to be something
<weeping_pegasi82> ChaosDuck: type there name, you can use tab for autocomplete
<Buytoast> nor have to run away
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The game could at least drop a hint to be fair...
<Buytoast> granted i do like the whole, this sticker works on this guy thing
<Buytoast> but yeah, hints are sorta lacking there
<ChaosDuck> weepin_pegasi82 thanks
<Buytoast> and so you dunno what you need
<Buytoast> hell, i had to look up how to get the third boss
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I kind of now miss the whole tattle thing
<Buytoast> because i thought i needed a musical sticker
<Buytoast> when the thing i really needed was completely different
<pony_6124> derp:P
<Buytoast> although i do know they drop hints sometimes during the fight
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It said I needed the faucet besides the sponge, but I never used it because when I got sprayed I didnt get poisioned
<Buytoast> and sometimes the enviroment hints too
<Buytoast> it just told me to get something absorbant
<Buytoast> after i looked it up
<Manearion> ZOOM OUT
<Buytoast> how far are you exactly?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Just beat the third boss yesterday
<AJIsAwesome> Manearion: If you're talking to the mod, its best to ask nicely.
<Buytoast> ah
<AJIsAwesome> *it's
<Buytoast> then you wouldn't know about the fifth one
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Actually I do
<Buytoast> ah
<Manearion> Oh sorry...
<Malmortius> I just tried to skip forward on the stream.. *facepalm*
<Buytoast> i like him being the boss and all
<Buytoast> but it's just so out there
<Manearion> EY TEGLO GIT UR PIC WHERE I CAN SEE IT PROPER 'KAY LAD
<Buytoast> everythign else fits the level
<Buytoast> and then you get him
<naturesfury> wjat game are yall talking about now?
<pony38865> gak ant
<Buytoast> Stoker Stair
<Manearion> Delish <3
<naturesfury> never heard
<AJIsAwesome> New Paper Mario game for the 3DS.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At first I thought the Leaf sticker was a joke item, turns out its pretty usefull combined with the Battle Spinner
<Buytoast> i never used it
<Buytoast> i get excellents naturally
<SpadeMagnes[School]> <.<
<Malmortius> Sigh, how can anyone listen to this music..
<Scoot-Scootaloo> wub wub~
<weeping_pegasi82> Malmortius: a lot of people can and besides if you don't like it just mute the stream and listen to your own music
<Malmortius> I am now :P
<Malmortius> Its strange how music taste can differ so much
<Malmortius> because this music is almost disgusting to me.
<Malmortius> its like audio cancer
<weeping_pegasi82> good to know
<Buytoast> you know what's disgusting?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh jesus..mute it and stop bitching
<Buytoast> them Communist Terrorists
<Wrek> 05jstu casue Manearion is here
<Manearion> <3
<Manearion> Yes!
<Manearion> YES
<Manearion> Åskfödd~
<Tyr> lol
<Malmortius> Shouldn't you be able to see the right ear?
<naturesfury> Malmortius: u gotta give it time man
<Manearion> Bet you there will be some hair poppin' up there Malmo!
<weeping_pegasi82> Malmortius: dude he just started
<Manearion> Nääääär jag går ut i bnland
<Manearion> Seeeeer jag ett vinterland!
<Malmortius> usually you map everything out first :l just wondering since theres no indication
<naturesfury> cant rush perfection
<Manearion> *ibland
<Manearion> Well Malm, if he puts up enough hair there, you wouldn't see it.
<weeping_pegasi82> Malmortius: it's called layers and you toggle them on and off so they don't get in the way
<Malmortius> Oh hes already done the right ear
<Malmortius> ?
<Manearion> Also I have a tendancy not to map things out when I start drawing, I can't speak for how Teglo does it.
<Dark92Enigma> back, my mom allowed me to get back (somehow)
<naturesfury> dem rubber band sounds
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Dark92Enigma :)
<Manearion> It's a jaws harp...
<weeping_pegasi82> WB
<Manearion> >Rubberbands xD
<gravy> ...
<gravy> wow:)
<weeping_pegasi82> ......
<gravy> ......................................................................
<AJIsAwesome> Do not spam, gravy.
<weeping_pegasi82> yeah don't put gravy on spam!
<Malmortius> The bent leg looks a little too short :P
<weeping_pegasi82> Malmortius: wrek is the artist he will fix it if HE thinks it should be fixed
<otakon> hey Wrek quick question
<Malmortius> Thats the worst opinion ive ever heard
<Malmortius> positive critism is always good
<Buytoast> opinions are forbidden here
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Some times it pays to be blunt
<Malmortius> When you're working on your own artwork its sometimes difficult to see whats wrong with it
<Tyr> this is the internet, Opinions are landmines
<Buytoast> stop lying Malmortius
<Buytoast> you're just being a darn dirty troll
<Malmortius> no im not :l
<Tyr> no i agree with his last post
<MadSurge> Hey Malmortius :)
*Scoot-Scootaloo ahem
<pony85132> best pony ever :3
<Malmortius> I said the front right leg is a bit too short, how is that trolling?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> It seems as though we got a NEAIGHHH sayer here...
<naturesfury> o dear
<Buytoast> that was awful
<pony85132> trolling
<DarkColt> That was bad.
<DarkColt> So, so bad xD
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: A NEIGH SAYER!
<AJIsAwesome> I love the Power Glove. It's so bad.
<Malmortius> Its usually the way with fans, isnt it. If someone admires a person more talented than they are, they think they can do no wrong, so they'll defend them blindly.
<Tyr> yep
<scotalo> gak
<Buytoast> I think the joke went over his head.
<Malmortius> I love getting critism on my work, being blunt without trying to hurt your feelings is a good thing.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Some times it doesnt pay to make people feel good when they've done something wrong, it sometimes works to be blunt
<scotalo> gak
<SpeccyRush> it's more you're an ass who always complains about every thing , so why shold we listen to you
<Malmortius> i dont complain about everything, just.. a few things.
<Buytoast> Hey, I'm an ass who complains about everything and you people listen to me
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile complains about everything
<Tyr> he doesn't complain, i've only seen him critisize
<Malmortius> i didnt say you should listen to me i said not to be so touchy on critism
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Buytoast: Yeah, but you're a lovable ass, like Meanwhile~
<Kurra> ugh x.x
<Jmo> Meanwhile doesn't complain, he states fact.
<SpeccyRush> ^
<Kurra> nothing like ruining the day with a bad neighbor
<Buytoast> well i do that too
<Buytoast> like yellow quiet being the best horse
<HavokOC> Meanwhile is a nice guy, be nice to him >.>
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fact? he sure states things the most negative way possible
<Jmo> You really don't.
<Buytoast> and white selfish being the worst
<Malmortius> stop overreacting guys, jesus.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Internet fight!
<Tyr> told you.. internet
<Tyr> opinions are landmines
<Malmortius> And how is "the bent leg seems a bit short" the most negative way possible?
<ant> i can not see her mane
<HavokOC> http://tinyurl.com/d7n79cm
<Manearion> Gotta go and make pytt i panna!
<HavokOC> ^ Fitting for this
<naturesfury> ant hes drawing it as we speak
<Scoot-Scootaloo> We don't take too kindly to "opinions" and "criticsm"
<Manearion> I'll be back Teglo <3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> What is this, Murrika?
<HavokOC> Wait, manearion
<Malmortius> Not sure if serious scoot
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Opinions on the internet are myths
<Manearion> Hmm?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> like Bigfoot
<HavokOC> Are you possibly swedish?
<ant> :D so fuuny
<Manearion> Indeed!
<HavokOC> :D
<HavokOC> So am I :P
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam didn't fly into the sun to give birth to the new nation of the world just for opinions and criticism to pollute it.
<Manearion> Tjosan!
<HavokOC> ohai
<Manearion> Tjenare mannen!
<ant> apple troll
<Manearion> But I do have to go now.
<HavokOC> English only in here :3
<Wrek> 05men vafan grabbar
<Manearion> I'll be back~
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But he sure as hell let stupid government to pollute it
<HavokOC> Yupyup wrek
<ant> agaby
<ant> ....
<HavokOC> err, i think it's english only in here
<Buytoast> Don't you talk that way about our president.
<HavokOC> >.<
<Buytoast> You racist.

<HavokOC> Oh, right. Wrek

<Malmortius> Does wrek use a tablet?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Good old america, where now adays if you're too old you dont get that hip operation...
<Buytoast> The old have had their time on Uncle Sam's earth.
<Buytoast> It's time for the new generation to consume the burgers of freedom.
<gakant> a funny go to www.equestriadaily.com
<Malmortius> How longs wrek been working on this piece altogether?
<naturesfury> sigh i would complain about that Buytoast if i dident know it was so true
<gakant> trixie
<AJIsAwesome> A few days, IIRC.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I find it funny and somewhat Ironic, living in America and seeing it decline has made me so pessimistic
<Buytoast> but Sir Dragonspanker's Resort of Horse Drawn Carnage isn't funny at all
<Malmortius> So how longs wrek been working on this :l
<Buytoast> Since the world was still fresh from Uncle Sam's George Foreman Grill.
<alexxm> hey guys
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, alexxm. :)
<Jmo> I'll give you a rason Scoot
*Jmo slaps Scoot-Scootaloo around a bit with a large trout
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The way Buytoast acts, I have a hard time telling when he's sarcastic or serious
<Malmortius> anyone know how longs wrek been working on this for
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Thanks...?
<Jmo> AJIsAwesome answered your questions Malmortius.

<Zompony> hey there everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Zompony. :)
<Buytoast> but apple horse is only the third best
<Buytoast> behind yellow quiet and pink obnoxious
