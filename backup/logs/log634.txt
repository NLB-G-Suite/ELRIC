<otakon> seriously only wanted to play till the end of the Prologue
<Meanwhile> But they do try.
<Shizuka> 13camera's too old and crap to get a picture though
<otakon> 4 hours later
<otakon> STILL not sure what to do with Geralt
<Meanwhile> Sunrise. Moon's absent my part of the planet.
<otakon> anyhoo brb need a drink
<Reikim> Excercise wheels.
<Reikim> Aren't those made of metal?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14wasn't there a blue moon the other night?
<Meanwhile> Plastic.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm writing a story. I've been stuck on the first line for half an hour.
<Sumica> 00,10round windows seems like a waste of space
<Reikim> Wasn't really blue.
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: how so?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14first you wiggle your tail oink oink oink
<SaxyPretender> 0,14:2
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(:3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: Once upon a time....
<Sumica> 00,10it was a dark and stormy night
<Reikim> A blue moon is when a full moon appears twice in under a month.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<Canadian_Brony> Colt_Silver Sumica no. I need something about a memory. A promise to never forget.
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: In the beginning...
<Shamroc> my god
<Ryunosuke> that texan robo
<Ryunosuke> robot
<Sumica> 00,10it was the best of times it was the worst of times
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: It was the case to end all cases.
<Canadian_Brony> NO!
<otakon> a texan weeaboo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm guessing the original voice must've had a Kansai-ben accent
<Canadian_Brony> this is going to be DIALOGUE
<otakon> that sold ALL of his body basically
<HatsuneMikuFan> That robot reminds me of Victor from FallOut: New Vegas
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: sounds like exposition. Snip it out.
<Shizuka> 13generally the months don't line up that way
<Canadian_Brony> -_(\
<otakon> yeah
<Shizuka> 13thus "once in a blue moon"
<Canadian_Brony> why am I asking you for advice?
<Colt_Silver> SaxyPretender: sounds like Yesman from Fallout
<otakon> Funny thing about the Major
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...can't say I know who that is, Colt_Silver
<otakon> She's 98% synthetic
<Reikim> And again, it's not really blue.
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: because I have a literary background in scriptwriting and exprience writing for 2 indie movies that made it to independent film festivals?
<otakon> ALSO, if she ever quit the organization
<otakon> She'd have to forfeit her body
<Reikim> So the only ones really legitimately excited were the meteorologists who like this kind of thing.
<Ryunosuke> wait
<Reikim> The transit of Venus was a pretty big thing, a few months back.
<otakon> Since it's mostly governtment property
<Ryunosuke> that was a FAKE texan accent?
<Ryunosuke> :p
<otakon> She'd have to get a brand new Shell
<Kencolt> Oddly enough, he's right on one thing-- Pigs are incrediby closeto humans in surgical compatability-- so this isn't out of the realm of scientific possibility.
<Shizuka> 13yup that's extremely rare
<Meanwhile> Maybe we can get Bill Gates to make a giant blue light on the moon.
<Shizuka> 13the last was in 2004 i think
<otakon> Kencolt: enope
<otakon> Kencolt: cyborg mice recently
<Meanwhile> After all, blue is the best colour.
<Shamroc> TAG
<Canadian_Brony> Colt_Silver great. Ever written a Human in Equestria fan-fic that you are trying to make an actual story and not a "Mary-Sue Perfect World"?
<Reikim> Lies.
<Reikim> LIES.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's funny
<SaxyPretender> 0,14most of the stuff around me tends to be blue
<otakon> HIS BRAIN IS GONE!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but my favorite color is red
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: Sometims you gotta go with a Mary-Sue just to show how dark things can really get.
<Shizuka> 13before 2004 the last venus transit was 1882
<otakon> nice shot
<Meanwhile> -No, yellOOAAAAAAAHHH
<Shizuka> 13next won't be until 2117
<Shizuka> 13we'll all be dead or virtual by then
<Reikim> I will be dead!
<otakon> yay Tachicoma!
<Reikim> My vote's for ded
<Reikim> Anyway
<Shizuka> 13it better be the latter or i'm haunting everything forever
<Reikim> Good colours are red or gold for luck.
<Meanwhile> We probably won't get that far in our lifetime.
<Meanwhile> We'll be dead.
<Reikim> Aw, Shizu, we wouldn't mind you haunting us.
<Reikim> Or, rather, we'd be haunting with you.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so...
<Meanwhile> That sounded way creepier than your probably meant it to.
<Shizuka> 13yeah but haunting shizu would not be as.... wubful...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Shizuka would be a ghost in a shell?
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: Start with a premise that gets subverted by the ending. What is the theme your story opens up with?
<Reikim> We shall be hauntbuddies in the afterlife.
<Shizuka> 13i am sure haunting shizu would be not very fun at all...
<Meanwhile> I'd be way more fun if I were haunting people.
<Icydragon3d> 13Welp, I'm out, peace you cancerous husks.
<Ryunosuke> that inconspicouus
<Reikim> Nah, it would be like Casper the friendly ghost.
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't have to give a shit about anything, just stealing peoples car keys.
<Cades> lol
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'd mess with people's stuff
<Reikim> Or rather, Shizu the Cheerful Spectre
<Canadian_Brony> Colt_Silver theme . . . uhh . . .
<Shizuka> 13oh is this the one with the hearts
<otakon> Sumica: you show the one with the errant tank yet?
<Canadian_Brony> how do I explain that?
<otakon> hiay Shizuka
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: Oh boy...
<Meanwhile> Specter*
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Shizuka> 13this is a good one
<otakon> Shizuka: it has the one with the texan box bot
<Reikim> Spectre.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah otakon, that was like ep 2
<Meanwhile> No.
<Reikim> Both spellings are acceptable in my lexicon~
<otakon> Sumica: the really big errant tank?
<Canadian_Brony> ah, nevermind. I think I got somethin'
<Sumica> 00,10the one with the guys brain in it
<Meanwhile> Your lexicon can go jump in an iced lake with a rock tied to it.
<otakon> Sumica: dammit
<Reikim> Seriously, the Canadian dictionary accepts a lot of alternate spellings.
<shibaru> I can sing again

<Shizuka> 13oh my batou
<Reikim> Nah, we have plenty of fun sports up here.
<Colt_Silver> Canadian_Brony: GL with your opening. But be careful though, U could spend hours writing a scene and end up having to drop it because its boring.
<Shizuka> 13shouldn't you two be doing that in private
<Reikim> In addition to the aforementioned curling/hockey combo.
<Polydunami> Thank you Sumica :D
<Phase4> 00,02BLEIGH

<Phase4> 00,02otakon, its what now?
<Reikim> There's ice skating. Ice sliding. Sledding. Skiing. Snowboarding. Jumping into ice-covered lakes. Ice fishing. Competitive polar bear driving. Igloo building. Ice sculpting. And the ever-popular football (of both types).
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, awww, i want to watch that
<Meanwhile> Hurling and cockey?

<twilight_sprinkle> and hey Phase4
<JESmith71> Phase4: Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex
<Shizuka> 13did you see bitbucket's april fools thing? spooning repos as a natural progression from forking
<otakon> So, why is the Major pissed off?
<Polydunami> You've got colon cancer, otakon :S
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, missed that
<otakon> Polydunami: huh?
<Shizuka> 13she's messing with their minds otakon
<Reikim> I think your sight's going there, Meanwhile.
<shibaru> xD
<Polydunami> : <-------
<otakon> Shizuka: I figured by why is she taking it so hard?
<otakon> damn don't scratch the paint
<twilight_sprinkle> a way out!
<otakon> well he just shit himself
<twilight_sprinkle> sploosh
<Shizuka> 13not so much taking it hard as doing some overkill so these kids never try it again
<Shizuka> 13gotta clean up crime somehow
<otakon> mhm
<otakon> welp you're screwed boyo
<otakon> O_o
<Shizuka> 13med students stealing hearts to sell to the black market, it's just dumb
<twilight_sprinkle> but its to pay for their college studies!
<otakon> oh he is so screwed
<Polydunami> Colon Cancer: Too Many Colons: WHY IS THIS HAPPENING: ded xP
<otakon> He is pissing himself so much right now
<twilight_sprinkle> ded
<otakon> I think The Major enjoyed that a bit too much.
<Shizuka> 13that's the more salient point, that they were getting themselves involved in yakuza stuff, and that's a really really stupid thing to do
<twilight_sprinkle> good job Major
<otakon> ah poor Tachikoma
<kirz|GW2> ^^
<sub06905> :D
<Shizuka> 13tachikoma needs to lose some weight
<otakon> dem hips?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that feel when a couple buddies who went to Japan kinda encounter a Yakuza
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*encountered
<Meanwhile> I'll never understand this Major ladies choice of clothing.
<Ryunosuke> lol
<otakon> SaxyPretender: O_o

<Canadian_Brony> Hello everypony.
<Meanwhile> I've been here the whole time.
<otakon> hiya Canadian_Brony
<Canadian_Brony> ha-
<Meanwhile> And very little.
<Canadian_Brony> no
<Polydunami> Oh hey Canadian_Brony!
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Canadian_Brony
<otakon> Seriously why does he excercise?
<otakon> He's a CYBORG
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, the manga got really fanservicey
<Canadian_Brony> no no, wait
<Canadian_Brony> I was trying to say hi to kirz
<Shizuka> 13best scene ever
<Sumica> 00,10Reminds him of his humanity
<otakon> Oh yes Shizuka
<Ryunosuke> lol
<Shizuka> 13^-^
<Polydunami> dat misogynism xP
<otakon> and then he punches himself out
<Meanwhile> rofl.
<twilight_sprinkle> stop hitting yourself!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> find a Stronghold start taking all the stone/books stuff until there is nothing but the portal
<otakon> The Major is a super hacker
<SaxyPretender> 0,14stop hitting yourself!
<Colt_Silver> Is She Naturally female or is she in a fembot body?
<otakon> She's also slightly androygnous I would guess
<cowvarkian> really need to go to lseep
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> anyway i should go to sleep, Goodnight everyone
<Shizuka> 13richard epcar is a brilliant va
<twilight_sprinkle> SaxyPretender: ninjad
<cowvarkian> yes Colt_Silver
<Ryunosuke> lol
<otakon> Colt_Silver: she was originally female
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
<Reikim> Night Trix
<Meanwhile> Night T.
<Colt_Silver> otakon: so wait, does that mean shes not anymore?...
<twilight_sprinkle> bye TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Reikim> The Major
<Shamroc> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Shizuka> 13we learn about her backstory next season
<Reikim> I read th manga
<otakon> Colt_Silver: but she's been in a cyborg body so long she's basically just memories and a personality
<Canadian_Brony> g'night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<kirz|GW2> and then batou gets his ass kicked
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think he was at ANime Boston this year
<HatsuneMikuFan> Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<kirz|GW2> :3
<otakon> Colt_Silver: think of it just of her mind left in a robot body she can switch out when she wants to
<cowvarkian> otakon: so, when you say cyborg, you mean android
<Shizuka> 13how can you be "so number nine"
<Reikim> Fanservicey...doesn't cut it.
<Shizuka> 13number nine of WHAT
<otakon> cowvarkian: well no, Android are robots that are made to resemble humans
<Meanwhile> I just don't see the logic given their line of work.
<Shizuka> 13came in ninth place in the lyrics writing contest?
<Polydunami> I am incredible math :+
<Colt_Silver> Shizuka: how can you be "incredible math"? We'll never know..
<JESmith71> Seven of Nine?
<otakon> besides a female android is a Gynoid IIRC
<Colt_Silver> how IS she when she doesn't surf?
<Shizuka> 13well for that scene at the end, it's an effective distraction
<cowvarkian> otakon, if she were a cyborg, then she would just have some cybernetic parts
<Meanwhile> Surfless.
<Shizuka> 13while you're busy staring, she's already hacked through your brain
<Polydunami> O/////O
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if Seven of Nine breaths a sigh, what do you get?
<cowvarkian> so, technically she is an android
<otakon> cowvarkian: she's got SOME organic parts
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: Assimilated.
<Meanwhile> Resistance is futile.
<cowvarkian> otakon, such as what
<Colt_Silver> SaxyPretender: a punch to the nuts
<otakon> cowvarkian: android have NO organic part
<kirz|GW2> and she's underestimated a lot
<Shizuka> 13just the brain in the braincase
<otakon> what?
<LadyCanary> ...ERRMAHGURD BABBIES
<Shizuka> 13she's otherwise 100% prosthetic
<otakon> Shizuka: but she can switch out bodies too remember?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<kirz|GW2> but I think too much clothing interferes with the active camo systems they have
<shibaru> Chest hurts, can't sing well, sing song that's too fast for me evern when I can sing
<Shizuka> 13but that's just a case of taking the brain out and putting it back in
<otakon> Shizuka: oh yeah
<Meanwhile> For that to work you'd first have to be staring.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, yes, but you also get a Sigh-Borg :3
<cowvarkian> so, she's an android
<otakon> Shizuka: I remember that, but I forget that part
<otakon> cowvarkian: NO
<Kencolt> In other words a full body cyborg-- ala Robocop, but nicer to look at.
<Colt_Silver> Shizuka: so she has ALTS in RL?
<cowvarkian> yes
<Shizuka> 13well the active camo they use the full body suits
<Shizuka> 13sort of
<otakon> cowvarkian: ANDROID IS A STRAIGHT UP ROBOT, NO HUMAN EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER
<cowvarkian> technically a cyborg, but more robot then human
<Meanwhile> And if you're in that kind of scenario and that's all it takes to distract you a loud noise would probably also work.
<Quick_Thinker> this a mario 64 pmv?
<cowvarkian> otakon, stop raging, i know what im talking about
<Quick_Thinker> sound lot like mario
<otakon> cowvarkian: CYBORG IS ROBOT WITH ORGANIC PARTS
<Reikim> Um
<Reikim> Er
<kirz|GW2> in the movie it's the android, and some clothing
<Reikim> Okay
<JESmith71> No it's Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini
<Polydunami> This sounds nothing like mario 64 :S
<Reikim> So that's what you were talking about
<otakon> cowvarkian: no you don't since you're not seeing the difference here
<kirz|GW2> *the android body
<Reikim> Ahaha
<Quick_Thinker> AYAY
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, that xP
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 diabeetus
<Reikim> I was referring to one of the scenes in the manga.

<Meanwhile> Yeah fair enough keep wearing that.
<Polydunami> So how about the original MV? :3
<Reikim> Shoosh, Meanwhile.

<Derpy_Hooves> can't kill what's already ded
<sub06905> hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13is a visual disaster
<Reikim> Are there multiple mangas?
<otakon> androids are robots built to resemble humans
<Quick_Thinker> dont know how to let oyu know
<cowvarkian> otakon: thats what I meant
*twilight_sprinkle buries sub06905
<Reikim> I remember one that had a lot of colour.
<Canadian_Brony> and now I'll never put words on te screen
<Polydunami> I prefer the original MV SO CUTE <3
<Quick_Thinker> SO CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Reikim> And a rather gratuitous cybersex scene.
<twilight_sprinkle> cool Pearly ! and btw hey :3
<Shizuka> 13i'd love to be a manga reader but the pages are so cluttered
<Meanwhile> Well. I don't know what's going on but that tail is adorable.

<Kinixys> That's better.
<Ponies47> Nighty night SuperBrony64|Zzz :)
<Shizuka> 13inb4 the next airdate is another hoax that EQD laps up
<xisbestchemical> airdate of what
<sub06905> :D
<kirz|GW2> and that is why I try not to pay half attention to the stream this late...
<CiderIsForDrinking> This is now my favorite anime
<Shizuka> 13kirz|GW2: brushie brushie
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: Shizuka right even when the episode time counter is up we'll always get peeps coming in and asking every day hour and after until it does air
<kirz|GW2> :3
<Ihop> brostate is my only pont site
<CiderIsForDrinking> The music goes perfectly, too
<Sumica> 00,10I still think we will see an airdate this saterday
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: My Money is by the end of September
<xisbestchemical> damn, my family has a celebration of life festival then...
<Colt_Silver> just a gut feelings
*kirz|GW2 noms on Shizuka's tail
<Colt_Silver> xisbestchemical: its just an announcement, dont ditch a bbq for something u can find out in 2 minutes
<JESmith71> Yeah during the repeat of the wedding seems to be a good place to first run the commericals
<xisbestchemical> k
<Sumica> 00,10well it's just the way they are playing up the weading eps
<sub06905> :D
<xisbestchemical> i cant ditch it, its at my house

<CiderIsForDrinking> Gun wielding teddy bear robots... Words cannot express.
<Meanwhile> You gonna get brushed.
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: So prepare for an advertisement blitz for the season premiere?
<sub06905> lol
<Sumica> 00,10yep

<xisbestchemical> lol
<Sumica> 00,10they know the bronys will be waiting
<Polydunami> Where did that anonymous pony go?
<twilight_sprinkle> fumofffuuuuuuuuu
<JESmith71> And once the commercial airs everyone then bombardes EqD's news email saying "OMG! The commerical aired!"
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: I guess since Celestia's God-status is down the drain, the crystal pwnies r ganna play a big part in re-establishing the canon
<magmablock> Pokespeak

<NocturnalBlade> nite kirz|GW2
<Shizuka> 13in all seriousness i need to get one of those blindfolds..
<Colt_Silver> oh wow....The music score is beautiful...
<Sumica> 00,10they help so much Shizuka
<CiderIsForDrinking> goodnight Kirz|GW2
<Colt_Silver> Its like something from looney tunes when it was real big
<Shizuka> 13especially when i have a tendency to need to sleep while the sun is rising...
<Sumica> 00,10I used them alot on the train
<Shizuka> 13rarity got some good distance on that with a casual toss
<magmablock> Dat music
<Tyler_The_creator> Uhm....
<wirisme> silent pony?
<Tyler_The_creator> Anyone else.....
<NocturnalBlade> i think i shall follow in Kirz's footsteps...night everypony
<Tyler_The_creator> silent?
<Colt_Silver> The music...Its so beautiful...
<shibaru> You sure do quiet a lot.
<Tyler_The_creator> I can't hear the voices :(
<Shizuka> 13YEAH TOAST
<NocturnalBlade> Tyler_The_creator: thats the point...BGM version
<Tyler_The_creator> nevermind
<JESmith71> Tyler_The_creator: This is BGM only version
<Meanwhile> I hate toast.
<Colt_Silver> Tyler_The_creator: we're going through the music scores
<Tyler_The_creator> BGM?
<CiderIsForDrinking> These are my extra moustaches.
<Aylnine> I can hear Sweetie Pie's squeaks
<Shizuka> 13i need to make my own soundboard with stuff like "YEAH TOAST" and pyro
<Aylnine> er
<Tyler_The_creator> BGM?
<Meanwhile> Wombo combo
<Aylnine> Bell.
<Aylnine> -_-
<Colt_Silver> Tyler_The_creator: background muzik
<JESmith71> Only background mudic
<JESmith71> music
<NocturnalBlade> Back groun music
<Tyler_The_creator> I see.
<NocturnalBlade> *ground
<Shizuka> 13back grown music?
<Shizuka> 13ew
<Tyler_The_creator> What exactly is the point?
<wirisme> fandubs?
<Colt_Silver> Tyler_The_creator: by any chance r u a rapper and are 21 years old?
<Polydunami> Good night NocturnalBlade
<Tyler_The_creator> You guessed it.
<JESmith71> Because the BGM score rocks so much it deserves to be heard on its own
<Kinixys> I like this.
<Tyler_The_creator> The founder of Wolf Gang.
<Sumica> 00,10the point is no one ever enjoys the music and other foly work that is done
<Shizuka> 13dubs, appreciating the bgm, translations
<Colt_Silver> Tyler_The_creator: Oh, we're just noticing the beautiful, delicate, subtleties of the musicscore for this episode
<wirisme> I do
<Polydunami> ... Even though you're NOCTURNAL :S
<NocturnalBlade> and after that i go to bed for real...night all
<Colt_Silver> The music is actually brilliant, in a sublime way
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/m39l8.jpg
<Shizuka> 13
<xisbestchemical> if you listen hard enough, you can still hear the voice acting
<sub06905> cereal + carrots + eggs + saucepan = fried eggs
<Tyler_The_creator> logic
<NocturnalBlade> Polydunami: yea i know, the irony is too much XD
<sub06905> seems legit
<Colt_Silver> its like something from a feature film Direct-to-DVD looney tunes movie.
<Tyler_The_creator> Don
<magmablock> Sweetie Belle is best CMC
<Sumica> 00,10many dont even realse each pony has their own theme music
<Shizuka> 13they should do that for an ep next season, full on tom and jerry style mickey mousing
<Kinixys> This background music is pretty good.
<sub06905> lies, scootaloo is best cmc :$
<CiderIsForDrinking> ^
<Polydunami> Oh my, maybe for at least a segment, Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10I can never pick a best CMC
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: whoah really? how can u tel?
<Sumica> 00,10I love them all too much
<Tyler_The_creator> Vaccume
<Malk> Howdy everypony
<sub06905> twist is best cmc........ wait
<Kinixys> Hi Malk.
<CiderIsForDrinking> Hey Malk
<Sumica> 00,10Colt_Silver, it usesly plays when they first show up
<Tyler_The_creator> God, I love Twist.
<Polydunami> Twist is most underrated pony.
<magmablock> Vorpal
<sub06905> ello Malk
<xisbestchemical> it needs more cowbell
<Shizuka> 13this needs something.... like... fine motor skills...
<Colt_Silver> Scootaloo deserves the most love tbh. Shes a crippled pegasi disowned by her pegasi parents for her disability and forever banished to live amongst the earth ponies.
<JESmith71> This BGM only things made me appericate the show's music even more and gave me another reason to like it
<Colt_Silver> JESmith71: Ditto
<Tyler_The_creator> Pinkie pie style.
<twilight_sprinkle> my primary function is failure...
<Polydunami> Actually, I lied. Princess Celestia is most underrated pony :3
<Sumica> 00,10they even do things like ajusting the echo
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's not easy at all to strip out vocals only
<Polydunami> I wonder if Swainize will show up for the new episodes...
<Cades> lol whats wrong?
<Shizuka> 13especially for squeaky bell
<box> what's the server address for PonyChat again?
<Sumica> 00,10well the front tracks are gone Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> princess celestia needs to do something for a change <.<
<JESmith71> Polydunami: Trollestia too
<Polydunami> Who?
<Sumica> 00,10but the echo effects of a room are in side tracks
<Polydunami> :3
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: he said he would TroIIestia too
<xisbestchemical> my binder is organized chaos
<Shizuka> 13ah
<Mutterguy> Oh!
<Sumica> 00,10so basicly you hear the voices bouncing off the walls
<shibaru> I was talking to Mike about my chest pain
<Sumica> 00,10you wont hear it as much outside
<twilight_sprinkle> if the world isnt going to love me, ill teach it to fear me instead!
<magmablock> This show has the best facial expressions ever
<Ninjazz> And drum roll.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Sumica> 00,10as you will when they are inside
<Ninjazz> ded.
<JESmith71> Polydunami: He does the same thing as Swainize but records five of the rooms at once and does voice commentary
<Cades> oh
<Sumica> 00,10notice you cant hear them now
<Colt_Silver> Sumica: Its little things like that that makes this show so awesome.
<Polydunami> I see.
<Shizuka> 13ah now i can tell
<Shizuka> 13ded
<Sumica> 00,10the echo effect is even ajusted based on the type of building they are in
<xisbestchemical> G'Night guys.
<shibaru> Part of me feels like he should just get it over with just to get rid of my chest pain
<twilight_sprinkle> bye xisbestchemical
<Tyler_The_creator> Night.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: i could hear them... or amybe it was in me head idonno
<Polydunami> Actually, I found out about Bronystate because of Swainize, JESmith71 :$
<Tyler_The_creator> Epic sister fight
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaad.
<JESmith71> Polydunami: Same here
<Shizuka> 13:O
<twilight_sprinkle> orite, this is the fear part
<Polydunami> What with the Derpy Chat reactions and all :D
<magmablock> Such a thing deserves TWO gasps
<Meanwhile> Well, that worked out nicely.
<Shizuka> 13that... was the most perfect yay ping timing i've ever seen
<Amras0000> there we go
<Sumica> 00,10hehe
<Mangoguy> So fruit hour is no more?
<Polydunami> Thanks Spectrum_Rush :D
<Cades> just keep asking him, i guess thats all i can tell you

<Tyler_The_creator> omg. Raritys puffed up cheecks.
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: oh god the split second chat stop, then explosion
<Kinixys> I forget which youtube vid had a recomendation for bronystate, but that's how I found out about it.
<Shizuka> 13meh you can do better belches than that

<CiderIsForDrinking> Blargh, I was disconnected due to my buggy internet.
<shibaru> Yea... and who says he has to actually listen to my heart? He could just take his headphones off the entire call and not tell me he did.
<Ninjazz> Drum rolls are always nice.

<Sumica> 00,10dear devs all clases are op please nerf
<magmablock> And here she lies about RD being the Wonderbolts' trainer, enen though the truth about her helping save the world twice is much moreimpressive
<Sumica> 00,10mages are fine
<Mangoguy> as are clerics and druids
<Kinixys> Oversized hats are OP.
<sub06905> wonder how the song will be
<Alchemist> im glad I cant hear their laughter in this one
<Ninjazz> Luna and that announcer from Kora.
<Ninjazz> Think about that.
<Ninjazz> THINK.
<Rommulus> fancy specticles are op
<sub06905> Sumica is op, nerfplz
<Polydunami> At least you can't hear those deriding laughs this time around :|
<twilight_sprinkle> warlocks are sooo op
<Mangoguy> Ninjazz that would be somewhat relevent for the reddit contest
<twilight_sprinkle> in wotlk at least
<sub06905> song tiem?
<Ninjazz> Awesome.
<magmablock> Song Tiem
<Rommulus> some tiem.
<JESmith71> SONG KAROKE
<sub06905> woot woot
<Rommulus> oh damn
<Ninjazz> Also, very late Hai, Polydunami.
*sub06905 doesnt know the lyrics
<Alchemist> is that her element of harmony she is wearing?
<DerpDash> SHOULD KNOW WHAT???
<DerpDash> Tell me :'(
<Jmo> Dat DerpDash
<twilight_sprinkle> we cant handle it! the wall is breaking! run for your liiiiives!
<Polydunami> Hey Ninjazz, I was lurking in the other channel during all that... stuff earlier :S
<CiderIsForDrinking> Umm, UMM.. P-POPULAR, CREME DE LE CREME
<Rommulus> Depressed butler that no one ate his food
<Mangoguy> DerpDash you should already know the answer
<sub06905> why was Rarity wearing twilights element of harmony?
<Sumica> 00,10so it's kinda hard to tell but unicorns, the primary color in there cutimark.
<Mangoguy> unless you are a ...CHANGELING!
<Sumica> 00,10Matches the aura color of their magic
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, I know. I know. I just saw you /part and went "OOOOHHH NOOOO! I forgot to say hai to him! ;_;"
<DerpDash> Mangoguy: I didnt listen to this song much
<DerpDash> Mangoguy: SO I DONT REMEMBER
<magmablock> I know the pony with the sunglasses and spikey hair is an expy of some real celebrity, but I can'tfor the life of me figure out who
<Alchemist> Sumica: not their eyes?
<DerpDash> Mangoguy: oops srry for caps
<CiderIsForDrinking> sub06905: Rarity = Twilight, Twilight = Rarity (In the Cutie Pox)
<Alchemist> Sumica: I mean aura color = eye color?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: which makes a certain plot point in a certain 2parter even mr obvious
<Spectrum_Rush> *more
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<sub06905> CiderIsForDrinking: i dont understand
<Polydunami> Ninjazz, please don't worry; I didn't want to bother you after all you've been through today
<JESmith71> That yay was well timed. Right when Rarity mouthed it
<JESmith71> Or at least it made it look like she said it
<Sumica> 00,10will have to check more Alchemist
<DerpDash> CiderIsForDrinking: And fluttershy = akwardly voiced person for particular situation man
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, thanks, man. Think I'll head off soon. Need to get my head on other things for now.
<Sumica> 00,10but I dont think so
<Sumica> 00,10cause twi's aura is more pink
<Sumica> 00,10and her eyes are not
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: it was purple in the first season
<Sumica> 00,10and celestias eyes are not gold
<Dark_Horst> then they changed it
<Dark_Horst> celestia's aura wasnt gold either in the first season
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: good example Shining Armors eye color to magic color
<DerpDash> aww man now i have to restart my laptop brb everypony :(
<Mangoguy> slight remix of Bolero there?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah season 1 disproves the rule
<Sumica> 00,10but they wanted to make the magic more noticable
<Ponies47> Isn't it Fancy Pants? :p
<Sumica> 00,10love this song

<Moopy> pffft boderlands please
<Gold_Demona> I've got a pile of Assassin's Creed games lying around on my Steam that I've never played before. I'd probably stream that and let everybody watch me fumble around like a noob. :P
<applejack`> omg :D
<Moopy> :D
<Gold_Demona> :D
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai again :)
<applejack`> hai MaxTheBrony
<Gold_Demona> ohai MaxTheBrony
<therainbowvortex> my sister found out i was a brony yester day
<MaxTheBrony> :o
<MaxTheBrony> did she approve?
<applejack`> x_x
<therainbowvortex> she still cant stop laughing when ever she looks at me
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<therainbowvortex> :'(
<MaxTheBrony> :s y she so mean .
<applejack`> i got sister like you
<applejack`> ...
<MaxTheBrony> My brother knows and he says i can do whatever i feel like doing :)
<therainbowvortex> every one at school know about me beeing a brony epesilay after today
<MaxTheBrony> :o
<MaxTheBrony> how come?
<therainbowvortex> didnt i say befor some guy went in to my bag found my flutter shy and riped off its head so i kicked his ass and now my knukles hrut maxthebrony
<applejack`> xD
<MaxTheBrony> :o Why would he rip off the head?
<MaxTheBrony> `And what kind of school are you going too , with people like that :s
<therainbowvortex> hes a hater he still has the head
<MaxTheBrony> :s
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex, Max wasn't on when you talked about that, so he didn't know.
<therainbowvortex> oh sorry max
<therainbowvortex> but seriosly the skin on most of my knukls has peeled off
<MaxTheBrony> :O
<MaxTheBrony> damn pretty serious fight then?
<therainbowvortex> yer i think i hit him a little to hard maby :|
<applejack`> i wen't to school today, and my friends has welcomed me "hi fuc*'in brony" :C
<applejack`> now i don't have friends in school yaay
<MaxTheBrony> I dont know whats the big deal is , If we ( the bronies ) arent showing the pony stuff in their faces they shouldnt give a fuck of what we are watching when we are at home.
<MaxTheBrony> I dont get the haters :S
<therainbowvortex> applejack my mates betrayed me to
<MaxTheBrony> If they cant accept you they never was your mates.
<therainbowvortex> only a handful of people can acept it
<applejack`> ponies ponies everywhere <3
<therainbowvortex> but no one eles i know is a brony i feal so alone :'(
<Gold_Demona> Growing up I found that it was actually easier to not have any friends than to hang out with people who don't actually like you.
<Flyboy> applejack`: sadly, some of the only ones who accept the show, are other bronies. so i'm lucky to have brony freinds like you guys :)
<MaxTheBrony> same therainbowvortex , no one i know knows.
<Moopy> hey guys look at this i am tower tooth
<Moopy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZHKjgmHdmA&feature=player_detailpage
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<MaxTheBrony> But i dont see the point in telling my friends.
<MaxTheBrony> Its just a show , its not a life style.
<MaxTheBrony> People tend to forget that.
<therainbowvortex> i meen you guys are freainds (soz about my speling) and it makes me relly proud to be a brony how all you acept me
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, see? Who needs friends in real life when you have us to come home to?
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Flyboy> MaxTheBrony: to some people (like me) it is a lifestyle. most of the things i choose to do in life are for MLP
<Flyboy> MaxTheBrony: like how i didnt weant to go to a safari on october becuase that month, season 3 is airing apparently
<MaxTheBrony> Ah , excuse me Flyboy didnt mean to offend :)
<applejack`> awww fu*k it, we love ponies and no one can change it!
<Flyboy> MaxTheBrony: its ok, no offense taken.
<Flyboy> applejack`: /)
<Rommulus> Hey All, I feel like drawing something however I am having a blank moment, any suggestions?
<MaxTheBrony> Ponies?
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<MaxTheBrony> nah , but what do you like to draw?
<Flyboy> Rommulus: think of a game you like to play, and draw something out of that
<therainbowvortex> i get real sad at time but then i watch mlp or come on here and it make me smile
<Rommulus> hmm, flyboy actually that gives me an idea, thanks!
<Flyboy> :)
<therainbowvortex> some times i feal like no one realy wants me around just because i watch mlp
<Flyboy> therainbowvortex: we all get that feeling sometimes. but you dont always have to be around people. some people feel better alone
<Gold_Demona> therainbowvortex: When I was in school I KNEW nobody wanted me around, and it was just because I'm a nerd.
<Flyboy> i get past that by having all the episodes on my phone so when i'm bored, i can just watch a few
<MaxTheBrony> I just started in a new class , Its a gamedesign class, and got really surpirsed there was only nerds there :D
<Gold_Demona> I eventually got over it and just did my own thing. Fuck everybody else. If they don't like what you like, whatever.
<applejack`> :)
<MaxTheBrony> I can finally realate to my other class mates
<therainbowvortex> when i get sad i hum pinkie pie smile song and know that she'll probly kill me if i dont smile
<applejack`> giggle at the gosthies?
<therainbowvortex> that to
<MaxTheBrony> I sitt and listen to Brony songs all way to and from school , im to afraid to listen in it :D
<Gold_Demona> Finding somebody you can relate to is awesome, but experience taught me that you get the best results by not trying to find anybody and just letting the kindred spirits come to you.
<applejack`> :D
<spitfirecolt2> whenever i am depressed i watch pinkie pie and i am happy again
<MaxTheBrony> Gold_Demona that was exactly waht i did .
<MaxTheBrony> new people , new personalities
<Gold_Demona> Exactly.
<therainbowvortex> its imposibly to watch pinkie and not smikle
<therainbowvortex> i mean smile
<Gold_Demona> Especially during Smile Smile Smile
<therainbowvortex> yer

<Herostar> I will see about getting it since this game is epic
<AdamTheDuck> You can easily defuse them Wrek
<Klumzeedragon> Herostar: You can also get it on consoles if you felt so inclined.
<Panda|Sleepies> AdamTheDuck yeah... you have to have a certain level.... otherwise you will trip

<AdamTheDuck> Hardcore isn't hardcore enough imo :P
<Flyboy> i'm too used to playing fallout 3 -.-
<flutterchu> those diamond armor thing's from that one game are just FABULAS and that attorey with black pointing hair *gasp* IDEEEAAAAA!!!!!

<Aircrafter> Except for the part of being killed in one shot.
<Herostar> aircraft so you can take multiple shotgunshells?
<Herostar> in irl?
<Aircrafter> Herostar: No...Why do you ask?

<Aircrafter> then yes.
<Herostar> yeah read back a bit and you'll see why i brought it up
<Aircrafter> Herostar: I don't like reading.
<Herostar> i betchya it has the same hit physics as irl
<flutterchu> rainbow dash tried to read a fanfic and only read 80% percent of it he knew that the other 20% wouldnt make him any cooler
<Herostar> btw- 1 shotgunshell in the leg = missing leg.
<Herostar> goodluck living with that, in the middle of nowhere

<AdamTheDuck> inb4 banhammer?
<TheRandomkid321> Heave mercy :'(
<Herostar> radiation? Let's jump in it! :D
<Metronome> Guys remember Rule 20?
<Klumzeedragon> But wow, that tab is so useful. It makes sense how people type out names so fast.
<Rommulus> Klumzeedragon: Yea it is very helpful.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rule #5 Do not discuss or link explicit materials.
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheRandomkid321, joke or not it was against the rule. Please go read them and think twice before posting.
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: You're okay man, just don't do it again. :)
<flutterchu> the weierdest shutup cartoon is oishi high school battle
<AdamTheDuck> Dat last bullet
<Rommulus> I just realised Wreks pistol has a golden pattern on it, or is that silver.
<Rommulus> I cant tell now that he is in doors
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, gold iirc
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Have you found the Mysterious Strangers Magnum yet?
<mentalyeffedguy> my english is failing me, what does explicit materials mean?
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPhoenix OKay then. I shall read the rules word by WORD (as I have before BTW) and prove to you as my mate says "I'm innocent."... he only says that when he isnt innocent though.... so.... yeah...
<MadSurge> mentalyeffedguy: no sex or gore material
<flutterchu> noodles is a rip off of ling ling who is a rip off of pikachu making noodles the most unspecial cartoon character
<mentalyeffedguy> good rule, noone wants to hear about that"
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: I think it's nice ivory and silver. :P
<MadSurge> mentalyeffedguy: not with ponies, no
<mentalyeffedguy> nasty sjitt
<flutterchu> MadSurge: fighting scene was good enogh without blood
<Rommulus> I think its the little details like that, that can really make a game more immersive.
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, http://goo.gl/naWib Hmm seems to be a bit of both, but mostly gold.
<flutterchu> *still shaking*
<mentalyeffedguy> has anyone read any good fanfics lately?
<Klumzeedragon> I love how we're talking about no gore as Wrek blows the head off mutiple ghouls. :D
<MadSurge> flutterchu: there's plenty of good fighting scenes without or with minimal blood
<flutterchu> MadSurge: i was talking about a canterlot wedding in mlp
<Klumzeedragon> mentalyeffedguy: Um, I've only read like 3 fanfics. :D
<MadSurge> flutterchu: that was glorious :D
<mentalyeffedguy> Klumzeedragon: ive read like 4-5 i think
<Rommulus> AdamTheDuck: Can you get a back view of the gun? if not its all good.
<flutterchu> MadSurge: i wasnt really asking for that i became a brony on aprill 1st this year poniville confidental was the first episode ive ever seen
<Klumzeedragon> mentalyeffedguy: Oh? Which ones? :) The last one I went through was The Ballad of Twilight Sparkle. It's a trixiextwilight fanfic. But it's like PG and hilarious.
<mentalyeffedguy> eyupp
<flutterchu> *still shaking*
<MadSurge> flutterchu: :D was it a good starting epipde?
<Aircrafter> ....Is he really....
<TheRandomkid321> Okay after reading the rules word by word (I am a quick reader) I honestly do not agree 100% with me neccesarily "breaking" the rule but I do admit I was walking on VERY thin ice for as stated in the "Do not discuss or link explicit materials." tab it states "Posting of Rule 34, pornography, gore, shock images or any content or messages deemed overly sexual or obscene in nature is strictly prohibited." And so I apolagise and
<flutterchu> MadSurge: i already knew some ponies before i watched an episode
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, http://images.wikia.com/fallout/images/b/b0/Lucky.jpg Not really back but it's on the wiki :P
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: No one really cares how you feel about it mate. Just dont do it again?
<Herostar> long post is long
<mentalyeffedguy> true :P
<TheRandomkid321> Herostar have you ever seen a government document, a script, or a great story that is of minimal length?

<Metronome> Oh.....
<Aircrafter> Saturn: Its also known as Tronitophobia.
<TheRandomkid321> Herostar I beg to differ...
<SirGanjalf> Thoraphobia sounds like a fear of hammers to me...
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: That would be like the best name for a phobia ever,
<Herostar> TheRandomkid321 so THORaophobia isn't funny?
<flutterchu> why did i drive up to a conversation talking about phobias *still shaking*
<mentalyeffedguy> flutterchu: whats with the shaking?
<TheRandomkid321> Herostar I never said that. I find it slightly humorous but I am positive that there are supirior jokes out there.
<Herostar> ice shotgun is awesome
<SirGanjalf> ...And it could be kinda useful for mods:P
<Klumzeedragon> mentalyeffedguy: He shakes during the thunder and lightning and tells us he's doing it for some reason.
<mentalyeffedguy> ohhhhh
<flutterchu> mentalyeffedguy: when im alone on the computer im SUPER CAREFUL but i shake alot and i shake even faster somtimes when thunder strikes

<Klumzeedragon> Herostar: They're mutated Super Mutants. 6_9 If mutants can really get mutated further.

<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: Action/puzzler ;)
<Aircrafter> TheRandomkid321: Dats trippy man. I had something like that happen to me when I was young once.
<Klumzeedragon> TheRandomkid321: I havent had any paranormal things happen to me. I have had a friend or two with some problems like that, so I half believe.
<flutterchu> ugggggghhhh ghost im afraid of ghost's
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, I wonder if Wrek feels like being a total dick in this quest. :D

<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu last time I clicked a link on here it was pornography.
<Klumzeedragon> SirGanjalf: I don't get it. 6_9
<SirGanjalf> Klumzeedragon: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/press-x-to-jason

<Klumzeedragon> SirGanjalf: That explains everything! :D
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: That's up to you. I post safe links.
<flutterchu> BANJO KAZOOIE WHY DID YOU LEAVE NINTENDO (sorry i had to spit that out)*still shaking*
<TheRandomkid321> I can't wait till the next gen of consoles come out. I've heared they are capable of PC graphics.
<Gold_Demona> Because Banjo Kazooie was made by Rare, and Rare left Nintendo
<Wrek> 05give it 2 years and the consoles will be outdated again
<Rommulus> by then pc will be even better
<Wrek> 05thats the problem with them
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: there's going to be a new gen of gaming?
*AdamTheDuck hugs his pc
<Wrek> 05unless they come with replacable parts
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I stopped trying to keep up with consoles.
<Wrek> 05upgrade ktis or soemthing
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: Cause Microsoft gave Rare a better deal, but now instead of letting Rare have their creativity, theyre being forced to make crap.
<Aircrafter> I will always like the feel of a controller though...Not a mouse and keyboard D:
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek I gues but I have always been attracted to them. It seems the way that games were meant to be played... with a controller in hand...
<Wrek> 05my current graphcard will keep me happy for atleast anotehr 3 years, expectign 5
<Wrek> 05then i can jsut chug a new one in
<SirGanjalf> Wrek: Then they won't be consoles anymore.
<Rommulus> why would they let you upgrade your console when they can make you buy a whole new one
<Wrek> 05you cant get the same precision controling on a consoles as you can with a mosue and keyboard
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu, welcome to 2000
<Gold_Demona> Rommulus: Because they wear out old farts like us who get tired of buying new consoles every other year. :P
<flutterchu> Klumzeedragon: NOOOOOOOOOOOO BANJO KAZOOIE MY FIRST FREINDS EVER I WAS SAD THAT THEY LEFT NINTENDO NOW THERE COMPETELEY GONE GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:'(
<TheRandomkid321> and also I like to be able to put a game in and then be able to play it and not need to wait half an hour for it to install.
<Aircrafter> ^
<TheRandomkid321> flutterchu they are not gone.... but they might as well be
<Aircrafter> That feel when you know its right.
<Wrek> 05half hour isntalls havent been a problem for ages
<Wrek> 05and with steam
<killerpony7733> ^
<SirGanjalf> I plan to buy some previous-gen(now still current-gen) console, when the new ones are released
<Wrek> 05they are downloaded isntalled as they are
<AdamTheDuck> I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist: http://qtv.ua/uploads/public/novosti_igronavtov/13185978218186.nrs.jpg
<Wrek> 05in fact
<ninja_pony> hello everypony its been AGES how is all of ya :)
<Wrek> 05the isntall abr has been replaced with the download bar

<ninja_pony> wow it is diffacult to find ANY infomation on season 3 hmm :|
<flutterchu> ninja_pony: the cmc will appear in episode 4
<killerpony7733> ninja_pony maybe because people don't want to spoil themselfs and have a common sense of respect to not post any at all
<Wrek> 05ninja_pony: implying youd ever want any info besides airdate
<Klumzeedragon> Thanks AdamTheDuck. :D I opened the Admiral AJ and my chat messed up.
<Kandarihu> Well, there are spoilers about Season 3 out, but we still don't have a premier date.
<Klumzeedragon> Said like ViolaGrey was best pony on the top bar and was being weird.
<ninja_pony> yeah air time i mean lol i dont want spoilers jezz i would be like :'( like i got a MASSIVE spoiler on halo 4 today was lik FFUUUUU :[
<CrimsonPhoenix> ninja_pony, there were no leaks whatsoever
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok there was a few but even then we do not discuss of such in here
<Wrek> 05i wonder why game companies dont desig ngames for PCs first
<flutterchu> I SHALL NOW CALL MICROSOFT MICROSHIT *still shaking*
<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix yeah and don't remind me EQD being silly and believing the rumors of when it airs
<Klumzeedragon> ninja_pony: Wait. What spoiler about Halo4?
<mentalyeffedguy> i clicked the source and it said by wreky.......thats awesomly coolio awesome cant come up wih any other words cool
<Wrek> 05must be a hell ton easier to port to consoel than the otehr way around
<CrimsonPhoenix> killerpony7733,that's EQD for you
<TheRandomkid321> A sad SAD day... I just found out there will be huamns in S3 FREAKIN HUMANS! http://derpy.me/RY-rG
<Wrek> 05for isntance scalign down the 2048x2048 textures to the standard 512x512
<Wrek> 05et cetc
<ninja_pony> Klumzeedragon: u DONT want to know a little hint someone that u would hav eNEVER guess comes back thats all ill say
<mentalyeffedguy> you troll!!
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321's link is just a dancing troll animated gif.
<flutterchu> TheRandomkid321: i got trolled :'( *still shaking*
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh Wrek, get the Ratslayer rifle, it's located near where you are :3
<Wrek> 05also
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Because they want to make sure it works better on the consoles? Since that's where the larger market is?
<TheRandomkid321> okay.jpg
<ninja_pony> TheRandomkid321: UR A MONSTER U KNOW THAT lol :D purrree evil
<Wrek> 05flutterchu: even if you are still shaking, you constantly typign it out is getting old and annoying
<Wrek> 05Klumzeedragon dark souls would be a perfect exampel here. excelent game
<Wrek> 05but the port didnt do well
<Aircrafter> TheRandomkid321: Jokes on you, I like being trolled.
<TheRandomkid321> I got kicked for it? Worth it!
<Wrek> 05EVEN if the PC gamers asked for it
<Wrek> 05why?
<Wrek> 05becasue the port is a disgrace to gaming
<Wrek> 05ofc we hate console ports to PC
<Wrek> 05they always fail
<Kandarihu> Wrek, really? That's too bad.
<flutterchu> Wrek: i just think that if i dont type that ill have complains that i dont have astraphobia and i actually do and for pony's to know me more
<AdamTheDuck> once again: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs44/f/2009/140/2/2/PC_Gaming_Master_Race_by_Claidheam_Righ.jpg
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<TheRandomkid321> I hate PC gamers who say console agmers are gay because they don't have "superultrafantasticgraphics!"
<Aircrafter> Durrr like graphics matter.
<Kandarihu> Technically, Magicka was originally designed as an XBOX 360 game, and then it was ported to the PC. The original version was scrapped, citing control issues with the controller. But the PC version DOES support the controller, conjuring elements with the right analog stick.
<Wrek> 05phobias are always aweful
<mentalyeffedguy> ive pre-oredered black ops 2
<Wrek> 05but we know now
<Wrek> 05and those that dont believe oyu i am sure will give you the benefit of the doubt
<Herostar> geckos. they get huge round here.
<Wrek> 05otherwise they can fuck emselves
<Wrek> 05but right now
<Wrek> 05its getting annoyign with the ocnstant typeouts
<flutterchu> thanks to this picture of season 3 episode 4 i know http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/4/42/Will_Anderson%27s_station.jpg

<AdamTheDuck> Wrek you're too nice today :S
<Wrek> 05i know its aweful
<Wrek> 05but i cant help it
<Wrek> 05<3
<AdamTheDuck> What have you done with the Wrek we all know a love for being in a constant bad mood? :D
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Yeah. It does sound like going from console to PC is harder than PC to console. But they cater to where they get the more business I guess. Wether that's really fair or not. But that's a shame. I was really thinking about getting Dark Souls for the PC for the extra content...
<flutterchu> i can imagine my human self in mlp grapics :)
<TheRandomkid321> I would yell at hitler.... but if you aked me to yell at wrek I would say "Aw f### that I like living."
<Klumzeedragon> mentalyeffedguy: I have it pre-ordered too.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I just got a new favorite song
<Kandarihu> If these Brights do their Great Journey, will they do any harm to innocent people?
<TheRandomkid321> Kandarihu Nope.avi
<Kandarihu> Then this really is a bad thing he's doing, by sabotaging their migration.
<TheRandomkid321> My cousin is name Jason Bright... He is some sort of V8 racer I don't know.
<mentalyeffedguy> ill be right bach
<Wrek> 05my excuse is: ive always gone with the good option
<Wrek> 05and sicne its my 9th playtrhough
<Wrek> 05soem variation is nice ^_^
<AdamTheDuck> Holy 9th?
<AdamTheDuck> Damn
<Rommulus> wow 9th
<Kandarihu> Wrek, I see. Carry on, then.
<SirGanjalf> Well if someone would like to see a decent console port, i'd advice him to check out "Alan Wake" on steam
<Rommulus> Do they actually make it to the moon?
<Kandarihu> That's a good excuse
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: If he doesnt kill them, I think so. :P
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, haha no, the moon isn't their intended destination
<Rommulus> Where is
<flutterchu> hmph chuggaconroy has like 19 playthrough's AND he found a shiny pokemon so this 9th thing is nothing to me
<mentalyeffedguy> Wrek: how do you make youre art?
<SirGanjalf> Yep, Fallout series are pretty re-playable
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, doesn't really state, they just want to reach a planet that is naturally full of radiation.
<CrimsonPhoenix> mentalyeffedguy, he draws
<SirGanjalf> I don't even remember how many times i've played first or second Fallout
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: This is that invisible Super Mutant right?
<AdamTheDuck> Klumzeedragon, Eeyup
<CrimsonPhoenix> He grabs his tablet, open sai and stroke the stylus on the tablet
<mentalyeffedguy> like with his hand? with his hand?!
<Gold_Demona> He uses faith, trust, and pixie dust... wait no, that's not it
<flutterchu> please dont shoot
<CrimsonPhoenix> mentalyeffedguy, no with his foot
<flutterchu> O_O i almost had another heart attack
<Gold_Demona> And his teeth
<Klumzeedragon> flutterchu: He has too. :D It's the point of the game.
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu, then lower the volume. :P
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: i beleved that help and the storm stopped but im still shaking and my coat isnt white anymore
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, it the game just freeze?

<Bronysith> i wish i could make that up
<TheRandomkid321> Mates? listen I can't sleep. I am terrified of a kid at school I have visions of him gutting people with a saw. The original chat on stream isn't working for me so I am on here without watching the stream.
<Gold_Demona> I saw a Hello Kitty Darth Vader once
<Bronysith> TheRandomkid321, middle school?
<TheRandomkid321> Bronysith High school. ANyway the original cht is working now. Just a sec.
<AdamTheDuck> It's so strange reading TheRandomkid321 's post then reading Gold_Demona 's o.o
<PinkiePry> XD
<Gold_Demona> LOL XD
<Gold_Demona> I was replying to Bronysith, but that's pretty funny. XD
<TheRandomkid321> I wish I had a big iron so I could shoot that insane mother effer in the bloody head.
<Bronysith> here i am
<PinkiePry> So what just happened with the stream? It going down and all?
<mentalyeffedguy> you crazy fuck! dont you know how to deal with bullies?
<killerpony7733> Stream is running okay for me
<PinkiePry> Yeah... Now. :D
<TheRandomkid321> mentalyeffedguy He isn't just a bully he is mentally insane. He cut me randomly when I was trying to be his friend
<killerpony7733> Nope it's all okay and hasn't been screwy at all so far
<Bronysith> welp
<mentalyeffedguy> pick up the closest desk and smashit as hard as you can into his head
<Bronysith> i better just upload my pictures to facebook
<mentalyeffedguy> that bad?
<PinkiePry> TheRandomkid321 Do you approach him, or does he approach you
<PinkiePry> ?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, Fuck, cut? It's illegal to carry a knife in Australia o.o
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck he did it with a sharpner blade.
<Wrek> 05dealign with bullies takes finesse
<AdamTheDuck> Sharpener...

<AdamTheDuck> wat.
<Wrek> 05you need to humiliate them
<TheRandomkid321> Whatever
<Wrek> 05at the rigth time
<AdamTheDuck> Does he think he's some badass with a sharpener blade?
<Wrek> 05in a situation where there is no way you can be blamed for "his" actions
<Bronysith> Wrek: i found myself to outwit them or outsmart them is the best way to humiliate
<killerpony7733> Wrek or in some cases ignoring them and making them bored of you can get you somewhere
<TheRandomkid321> Well only me and my friend know he has autism because he bullies us both
<Wrek> 05depedns on the bully really
<Wrek> 05if the guy carries a knife
<Wrek> 05carry a bigger knoife
<AdamTheDuck> I like your think Wrek. :D
<TheRandomkid321> I have a SOG Seal Pup 2
<Buytoast> oh boy, it crawling in my skin complaining about life again?
<PinkiePry> Tell someone, honestly no one would blame you. Wrek has a good point to though. XD
<Rommulus> You call that a knife? this is a knife!
<TheRandomkid321> Buytoast no. and PinkiePry I have told MANY
<PinkiePry> Have you told adults?
<Buytoast> well then who's complaining about what now?

<thelonepony> hai MLP_Brovakiin
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: You're having VISIONS of him gutting people, but what does he actually DO?
<Buytoast> that's what all the hubbub is about?
<PinkiePry> Ok RandomKid, what about this? Why don't you go up to an athority figure and ASK THEM WHY THE FUCK THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING. Pardon my capslock swearing. XD
<Gold_Demona> Like in real life, what does he do?
<Buytoast> exactly
<TheRandomkid321> PinkiePry done it.
<Buytoast> so far all you've said is that you have visions
<mentalyeffedguy> best advice pinkiepry
<Buytoast> but you haven't said anything he's done

<TheRandomkid321> Gold_Demona cut's people for pleasure
<Rommulus> Its ok if you use your royal canterlot voice Pinkiepry
<PinkiePry> Yay!
<Gold_Demona> TheRandomkid321: In real life? He ACTUALLY cuts people?

<MLP_Brovakiin> Thats good to know :)
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Hello!:)
<AJIsAwesome> *pretty*
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Trigun is awesome
<Bronysith> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/405781_3782450036164_551558034_n.jpg Wrek you may or may not like this pic
<PinkiePry> Anypony else here watch/read naruto?
<AJIsAwesome> TheRandomkid321: Realy?
<AJIsAwesome> PinkiePry: I have.
<Gold_Demona> Trigun: One of my cats is named Vash the Stampede, The Feline Typhoon
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bronysith: Lol
<Bronysith> PinkiePry: you mean ninja filler?
<TheRandomkid321> AJIsawsome... yes because we are ALL insane...
<Rommulus> Yes, I read ninja Filler
<TheRandomkid321> PinkiePry the bully LOVES naruto.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: :D Twilight Boba Fett
<PinkiePry> Ok, to all who have... I LOVE SHINO.
<PinkiePry> XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh
<Bronysith> MadSurge: twilight mandalorian
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5dh615
<AJIsAwesome> TheRandomkid321: Try to connect with him with that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's now a comic about those web browser ponies
<TheRandomkid321> AJIsawsome thats how this started by me being frendly to him.
<TheRandomkid321> I was sitting next to him when he ouled out a sharpener blade and cut me.
<PinkiePry> I say just steer clear of the guy, if he comes at you, run into a crowd. He's not gonna stab you in a crowd.
<Buytoast> a crowd is the best palce to stab him
<Buytoast> he can slip back into it
<AJIsAwesome> TheRandomkid321: Yeah, then it's best if you stay away from him.
<PinkiePry> Nonono, if he pulls a knife near you, scream out at the top of your lungs "DROP THE KNIFE YOU CRAZY FUCKING BASTARD!" That's right, go all Canterlot voice.
<PinkiePry> I mean that way someone will notice, well everyone will.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Make them all crash!
<TheRandomkid321> They will...
<MLP_Brovakiin> YAY
<PinkiePry> How does everpony feel about my latest idea? XD
<Bronysith> this trigun stuff is hilarious
<TheRandomkid321> That was.... entertsining?
<Buytoast> they notice
<Buytoast> but they won't care
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, just go "AAAHHH! He's gonna cut me!!!!"
<Buytoast> the'll all just clear away from him and let him get stabbed
<Bronysith> if someone physically bullies you, you should say "no no no no, dont do that, you will give me a boner"
<TheRandomkid321> I would sooner wag then have to be in a room with him.
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: What?:D
<Gold_Demona> lol, That's a good one Bronysith
<PinkiePry> Ok, revised plan. Scream "IF THIS MOTHERFUCKER DOESN'T DROP THAT GOD DAMN KNIFE I'M GONNA RAPE EACH AND EVERONE ONE OF YOU!"
<AJIsAwesome> I can't believe we have 93 people on chat right now.
<Gold_Demona> no, no threats
<PinkiePry> EVERYONE*
<Buytoast> people won't care
<Gold_Demona> Empty threats don't get you anywhere
<Kandarihu> The worst bullies aren't the ones who carry knives. The worst ones are the ones who carry clout. The ones who can pass themselves off as the victim of bullying and flag anyone they don't like as bullies.
<PinkiePry> It's not like they won't notice though.
<Buytoast> they'd notice
<Buytoast> but again
<Buytoast> wouldn't care
<Gold_Demona> PinkuePry: yeah, but why call that sort of attention to yourself when you want the bad eyes to be on the bully and not you?
<PinkiePry> Ok imagine this. Everyone is sitting quiet in class and then all of a sudden you hear someone scream "THIS BASTARD IS GONNA STAB ME!"
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wait is all of this happening in school?
<Buytoast> no some moron is saying hypotheticals
<Buytoast> because some other fool is having visions or something

<tSparx> dswv1ddswv123: Not necessarily. I don't think being a brony and being gay have any affect on each other.
<Wrek> 05dswv1ddswv123: of course not. being gay is a sexual preference and is not affiliated what type of entertaiment said person would enjoy.
<Everlasting_Joy> dswv1ddswv123: Only if you choose to see it that way, but that's a pretty petty way of viewing things.
<BronyInstrumental> i'd say there's no point to being a brony, as you can't choose whether it happens to you or not
<Pearly> Wrek, truth.. here here
<Troy> No your not gay for watching mlp and you are gay I have no problem

<PillowPoniCreeper> Meanwhile, why?
<tSparx> As I tell my mother all the time, "I don't pick the slang, I don't have to like it, that's just what it means."
<Pearly> why I don't like the word troll?
<Troy> Mr. and Mrs. Cake
<Meanwhile> Because I've been awake for 26 hours PillowPoniCreeper.
<CCCP> yes
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Well, internet trolls feed off of the niavity of internet newcomers.
*DrSteveSCARz Noms on candy apple and thinks about life
<Troy> Fluttershy gave me Diabeetus
<PillowPoniCreeper> Meanwhile: your bed. It calls you. Go to sleep before you pass out on so
<PillowPoniCreeper> Something*
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: In which the newcomers could be likened to babies.
<Troy> I'll take one off your hooves XD
<Pearly> CCCP, oh well I sitll do not know why people do it... it's plain stupid...
<AJIsAwesome> Last song?:(
<Meanwhile> PillowPoniCreeper: No. Will wake up too early. Must stay awake.

<Wrek> 05hurrdurr
<Pearly> DrSteveSCARz, yeah so I heard, and yeah CCCP
<PillowPoniCreeper> Meanwhile: a lot of caffiene isn't good for you. Probably explains why my growth spurt hadn't kicked in yet.
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: Nothing can save D-Wars.
<Troy> ignorant
<tSparx> Troy: Go to YouTube. Not all of us wanna watch ponies 24/7, especially since we've seen most every ep multiple times
<Troy> new to this stuff

<Everlasting_Joy> Reikim: Agreed, even with the rifftrax on Friday night, I was stunned and in pain from it.
<Troy> G3 is scary
<Reikim> Everlasting_Joy: Oh good lord not even the Rifftrax. It is a SPECTACULARLY bad film.
<Pearly> hahah give me g1 but not g3
<Maid_RainBow> Troy : G3.5 is carierst
<Troy> G 3.5 anypony?
<Gold_Demona> Troy: If you ask for ponies, you will get G3. Just fair warning
<PillowPoniCreeper> You know a movie is bad when even Rifftrax can't save it.
<tSparx> Give Pearly! all the g1, leave me with just the G4
<Troy> Can I ask for Fillies?
<AJIsAwesome> G1's okay, but not G3.
<DrSteveSCARz> Troy: No just go to fucking youtube
<tSparx> Troy: No, that's even worse, then we might get... G3.5 *shudders*
<Everlasting_Joy> Crowd surfn' like a rock star.

<MLP_Brovakiin> CrimsonPhoenix: Metal Celestia is the best Celestia :D
<Kinixys> Thanks Wrek. I like this band. I'll have to get some of their songs.
<tSparx> Celestia is probably a big fan of Tool too :P
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Cool.
<Rex_Mundi> Is it true that in Scandinavia, you either LOVE metal, or you cant stand it? No middle ground?
<CrimsonPhoenix> time to guess the crossover http://i.imgur.com/7BLbc.jpg
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: its scandinavia, so probably
<Kinixys> hehe
<MLP_Brovakiin> Is this Sabaton?
<tSparx> cowvarkian: It's Wrek streaming some metal band, Sabaten?
<Everlasting_Joy> MLP_Brovakiin: Yep

<alexxm> thanks Everlasting_Joy
<Masdragonflare> thanks tSparx

<MLP_Brovakiin> Masdragonflare: They are onlly there for movie night
<Star0184> Is this almost over?
<tSparx> Masdragonflare: Spike only has a stream and no chat, or vice versa, can never remember

<Pearly> spreading the cuteness of Pearly http://i48.tinypic.com/34telom.jpg
<Serenity> Geeks are just naturally smart, nerds are too smart on one or 2 subjects to the point of insanity

<CrimsonPhoenix> so what
<Lil_B> gunter_the_penguin I did and nobody gave a crap :/
<Wrek> 05then you have nothing to say
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not like you're gay or something
<DrSteveSCARz> I know
<Serenity> Only person who knows I'm brony is my mum, and that's only because she caught me :0
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DrSteveSCARz: let your parents figure it out. Trust me.
<DoctorWhoovesV100> @Wrek: amen
<CrimsonPhoenix> they'll just look at you awkwardly
<DrSteveSCARz> ok guys
<Pearly> I agree Wrek
<gunter_the_penguin> lil_b: aw crap :l
<DrSteveSCARz> i'lllet em figure it out :)
<Wrek> 05parents can be really theb iggest douches when it comes to being intolerant
<CrimsonPhoenix> and be like okay whatever
<Serenity> CrimsonPhoenix: Parents who aren't goons would. Parents who are would rip you up.
<Wrek> 05so unless you know you're oparents dont give a fuck
<Wrek> 05then sure
<Serenity> *Is sad because his dad is a goon*
<Wrek> 05let them figure out
<BaconMane> 0,5Wrek is best wrek
<Wrek> 05but tread carefully
*BaconMane hugs Wrek
<gunter_the_penguin> my parents already know that im a brony :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> here's my story
<DrSteveSCARz> i dont know what they will think
<Wrek> 05bronies have been kicked out for being bronies
*Serenity glomps BaconMane
<CrimsonPhoenix> I loved MLP
<Wrek> 05jsut casue their parents were ignorant
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Wrek: Yep.
<DrSteveSCARz> Wrek: I've heard of that story, sad
<Serenity> Wrek: Bloody Somethingawful, eh?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I collect pics in computer and the episodes in my computer
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Anyone remember that one story?
<MLP_Brovakiin> I have only told one person that I am a brony
<CrimsonPhoenix> one day I decide to buy the merchandise
<Wrek> 05time to surround sound
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome|Homework: At that one place
<gunter_the_penguin> when i became a brony i kinda expected a flame war from my sister
<CrimsonPhoenix> the brushables
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DrSteveSCARz: Yep.
<Reikim> http://wreky.deviantart.com/
<Reikim> Or
<Reikim> Nope
<Lil_B> When I told my parents (I'm 20) they were both like "Ok, nice" because they respect that I have my own live and trusth me in what I do
<DoctorWhoovesV100> my dad sucks he thinks being a brony mean your a pedo
<Reikim> Not link I wanted to post
<DrSteveSCARz> ima go derp around with my code on tumblr
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> My mom was okay with it, my dad needed some time but he accepted it.
<Reikim> This
<Reikim> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/362
<Reikim> You know you want that hat.
<Lil_B> and I told them to NOT spread the word, they don't have so far :)
<DrSteveSCARz> maybe put some browser ponies on it
<CrimsonPhoenix> shortly during the day my mother saw them and asked me later "why did you buy those things" I said "The show is cool and I show my support to it" she was "lol okay"
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DrSteveSCARz: Don't overdo it, though.
<gunter_the_penguin> when i told my parents they didnt care at all :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> that is it I know it's different to anyone but that's pretty much how you should do
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome|Homework: im might only put the mane 6 on it
<Wrek> 05i fidn it funny how many bronies are self destructive
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DrSteveSCARz: I'm just saying, they might find it a bit obsessive and initially reject it.
<Serenity> Wrek: I'm not a robot...that I know of
<Wrek> 05AJIsAwesome|Homework that is if you are lucky
<LadyCanary> ...Wrek. please tell me this is what I think this is.
<Fluttershy0182> Good morning, everypony!

<Ponies47> Serenity: Ah.
<DoctorWhoovesV100> LadyCanary: im being tame over here

<Serenity> Wrek: I think your PC could candle it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wrek your computer will handle the 1080 but the capture will just reduce it
<shibaru> i have gen over
<CrimsonPhoenix> though I wonder how laggy it would be
<Wrek> 05Serenity: im not worried about ym computer nor my connection
<Panda> Serenity his net couldnt~
<Lil_B> another song in this style I completely adore is "Maggot Brain" from Funkadelic
<Wrek> 05im worried about mips failign to redistribute the data properly

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hey :)

<gunter_the_penguin> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Rex_Mundi: How many copies?
<Lil_B> hhheeeyyy SuperBrony64 :::)))
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome|Homework: not sure
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Serenity: Isn't that the one with the coins?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Lil_B :3
<Wrek> 05SHINE
<Wrek> 05ON
<Serenity> AJIsAwesome|Homework: Yes,
<Wrek> 05YOU cAAAAAAZY
<Wrek> 05DIAMOND
<Serenity> ^ k
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Serenity: I didn't even see the point of the game.
<LadyCanary> Wrek: /)
<Wrek> 05(\
<Serenity> The game has way to many problems
<gunter_the_penguin> i really hope someone else in my school is a brony or when i show up in a vinyl scratch shirt its gonna be awkward :l
<Lil_B> Serenity zeah... I reallz like Nintendo, but the recent Mario Games reallz were all between bad and meh...
<mentalyeffedguy> who are playing, what band?
<Serenity> It's so easy, I beat the game in an hour, the new powerups were rare as rocking horse shit
<Wrek> 05mentalyeffedguy: pink floyd
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Serenity: Sure it's about collecting coins, but you didn't really have to collect them. Now this game demands you to collect them, and turned me off from it.
<mentalyeffedguy> oh
<Serenity> And the white tanooki was OP as fuck
<mentalyeffedguy> i like pink floyd :3
<DoctorWhoovesV100> :) hippies :)
<Serenity> The biggest problem with the game is: It's as unoriginal as a CoD game
<Fluttershy0182> :)
<mentalyeffedguy> gunter_the_penguin: if i wore that shirt, and noone else were a brony, the fucks wodnt have been given :)
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I really don't like how they're making these new Mario games easy. It takes away from the challenge and difficulty.
<Serenity> Yeah, I bet my dead grandma could beat the game
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> The fact that there is challenge and difficulty makes it fun and adds more replayability to it.
<Serenity> So yeah, wasted 35 quid I coulda saved for a Computer
<gunter_the_penguin> mentalyeffedguy: oh ok ;)
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 I'm still working on you Desktop Pony, but it's kinda slow atm, I wanna speak with Vordox (I'm still new to this and he gives great design Ideas and currently I'm stuck at one point :/ )
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome|Homework, yeah. We're watching SuperBrony64 play NSMBW, and that game's being a real challenge to him.
<LadyCanary> WHERE WAS SAXY WHEN THE SAX CAME ABOUT
<Lil_B> Serenity sell your soul
<SuperBrony64> 11,02o.O
<Kandarihu> LadyCanary, in Gondor
<mentalyeffedguy> gunter_the_penguin: i wish i had a vinyl scratch shirt....
<Serenity> Kandarihu: That game was brilliant, because it was toughshit
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Kandarihu: That's great. I LOVE a good challenge.
<LadyCanary> Kandarihu: Motherfucker is probably busy doing fighting games stuff and hw.
<gunter_the_penguin> mentallyeffedguy: i just got mine yesterday:)

<Wrek> 05dayum

<Serenity> Sumica: Hi to you too ^^
<Pikachu> Hi Bronies/Ponies and Happy Labor day!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I beat NSMBW 100%, but it was VERY hard to get everything. That's why I liked the game.
<Sumica> 00,10Hi Serenity
<LadyCanary> UHHHH. Oh my god this is lovely
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat Sumica
<Serenity> I can't do it, stuck on World 8

<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek NSMB Wii :3c
<Sumica> 00,10it's because twi server's ban list was not matching up
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Too bad the co-op in th game is annoying. I had to stop playing co-op on the account of how tiring it was to be killed by your teammate.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> *the*
<Lil_B> ... and dark Souls still doesn't work :(
<Masdragonflare> hi pikachu
<Masdragonflare> i'm doing homework atm
<Masdragonflare> I'll be back later

*Bronysith glomps Luggen into Wrek
<tSparx> dat David Gilmour
<Luggen> Hi
<Luggen> ^^
<thelonepony> hi Luggen
<mentalyeffedguy> hi Luggen :)
<Luggen> so what´s up? :3
<LadyCanary> WAHOO!!!
<tSparx> Network Notice, man.
<tSparx> Is this post-Waters or?
<LadyCanary> GOOD EVENING SIR <3
<Wrek> 05hi Luggen
<tSparx> Like, Division Bell era Floyd, or?
<Luggen> hi x3
<tSparx> Oh, and then they play a song off Division Bell :3
<Rex_Mundi> gunter_the_penguin: As long as your cool about it, youll be fine. If someones says "You like MLP? in a mocking tone" simply respond "yes... yes i do". they cant really call someone out for liking MLP if you are upfront about liking MLP.
<tSparx> Got the purple drink, got the yellow drink, and we mix it up, call it - sup Pikachu :)
<Wrek> 05tSparx cant say for sure
<Luggen> ok, what´s your favourite episode? (I´m new so pls don´t hate on ,me for asking x3 )
<tSparx> Wrek: This is the "title" track for Division Bell, no Roger Waters :/ oh well
<Pikachu> tSparx: lol
<mentalyeffedguy> Luggen: mothertrucking sonic rainboom :)
<tSparx> Luggen: Tough call, but I'd say probably Lesson Zero (because crazy T-Sparx :P)
<kirz> Shizuka -> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/339
<MakerDusk> Luggen: S2E1
<Serenity> Luggen: Probably The last 2 of S2
<Luggen> I'd go with sonic rainboom 2 ^^ Love it :) goosebumps on my arms as rainbowdash breaks the barrier x3 *Silly fanboy screm*
<Cameh> hey =]
<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: You are the only one who refears to Twilight as T-Sparx
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Not true, I'm just the only one here. My BFF Tori refers to her as T-Sparx too :P
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: I recognize I'm in the minority, but I'm honestly shocked that most people don't understand where I get it from.
<Luggen> And yeah Serenity i really like the last 2 ones 2 ^^ Pretty much love every episode :/ But sonic rainboom is my favourite to ^3^
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Er, y'know, can't figure out who T-Sparx is without me explaining it :3
<mentalyeffedguy> Rex_Mundi: where do you get it from? ^^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Starship Troopers is the one with the giant spiders right ?
<tSparx> dat slide
<kirz> giant bugs, in space
<Meanwhile_> Lagship Troopers.
<tSparx> Ah yeah, "High Hopes," from Division Bell, by Pink Floyd
<Fluttershy0182> :)
<kirz> lol, I had forgotten about that
<tSparx> Took me long enough >_>
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile otakon get admiral rank
<Wrek> 05this is proper music
<LadyCanary> ^
<Wrek> 05jsutin beiber can fuck himself
<Wrek> 05and he probably has
<Meanwhile> Admiral of the great lag fleet. Otakon "The Buffer"
<LadyCanary> OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> DAT DISS
<mentalyeffedguy> Wrek: shut up! i love his music!!
<tSparx> Pink Floyd is one of my favorite bands, and a huge part of my life 4-5 years ago.
<tSparx> inb4 kick
<Eli> hi guys :)
<tSparx> Sup Eli :)
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> mentalyeffedguy: Just calm down. It's just a joke.:D
<Luggen> ok, here is one of the things i wanted to ask. I'm writing a song about fluttershy, got a nice melody nice tone but i lack the specific atribute of fluttershy which i want to build thelyrics on?
<Fluttershy0182> :)
<Luggen> So what aspect of fluttershy is what you find most important?
<Bronysith> http://th04.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/247/9/8/organization_xiii_dragoncon_2012_by_bronysith-d5d7q28.jpg Kingdom hearts FAN
<mentalyeffedguy> AJIsAwesome|Homework: not funny, hes my idol!
<LadyCanary> Doesnt get any better than Pink Floyd. Me and my dad listen together and sing in the car together
<LadyCanary> XD
<Eli> tSparx: feeling beat. probs because i am beat :P
<tSparx> Luggen: Her hidden/secret badassness :)
<tSparx> Nothing like smoking pot with your dad in the car, listening to Animals, hahaha
<Luggen> tSparx Like when she's fixing the bears neck? x3 her hidden baddass?
<God> hello
<Rex_Mundi> Wrek: Oh come on wrek, your not jumping on the Bieber hate bandwagon too? The kid makes music that doesnt appeal to us, thats true. But I recocnize the kid has actuall talent. Its Willow Smith that should get your hate.
<tSparx> Luggen: Yeah, or how she stands up to the lion, the dragon, the cockatrice, etc. Just like PInkie can get serious when she needs to, and Rarity can get kind and/or down n dirty when she needs to, Fluttershy can grow a spine when she needs to
<tSparx> TAKE IT BACK
<tSparx> <3
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Luggen: I would suggest Fluttershy's timidness and gentleness. Also maybe her inability to control her anger when she lets it out.
<tSparx> I love this song so much ... *sings along*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Otakon "The Buffer" vas LagShip
<Wrek> 05Rex_Mundi: CANT I HATE RANDOM THINGS WITHOTU GETTIGN CRITICIZED?
<mentalyeffedguy> Wrek: nope
<tSparx> Wrek: LOVE and TOLERANCE :P
<Pikachu> alright who wants to be next for me to draw them as a pony on gimp?
<mentalyeffedguy> Wrek: critique to you!
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Chat's derping, BRB.
<Cades> i have school tomorrow lol
<Sumica> 00,10besides it dont count as jumping on it when you helped build the wagon =p
<Eli> that floyd?
<tSparx> Pikachu: Ooh, me me me!
<Wrek> 05love and tolerate is more of a guidline when it comes to dealign with people than a rule
<LadyCanary> Yes Eli
<Wrek> 05and yes sumi, that is truew
<tSparx> Eli: Pink Floyd (post Roger Waters), Division bell, "Take It Back"
<Pikachu> tSparx: alrighty then what will ur cutie mark be?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the tolerate part is horrible
<tSparx> Pikachu: I still don't know >_> <_< hmm....
<Eli> just asking: are they still doing gigs? i'm not really informed about them...
<LadyCanary> Wow, tSparx. You know your Pink Floyd. Respect.
<tSparx> Pikachu: Leave it blank-flank and show it to me, I should be able to decide then :P
<Pikachu> tSparx: sures
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix has a point. There are some people who just don't really deserve tolerance.
<tSparx> Pikachu: Thanks so much, it's awesome that you're doing this!
<tSparx> Pikachu: Thanks so much, it's awesome that you're doing this :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Homework, you say that because you read the article
<tSparx> LadyCanary: I'm a pretty big fan :)
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPhoenix: True, and also because it's a valid point.
<FlutterMEDIC> hi all
<mentalyeffedguy> Pikachu: are you a good drawer`? if thats even a word :P
<tSparx> Eli: Kinda.
<Pikachu> tSparx: no prob i thought this will be super fun
<Rex_Mundi> I never understood the Bieber hate, the kid built his career by being talented and getting spoted on YouTube. Hes not a fake preety face that is no talent ala The Jonas brothers. I dont listen to Bieber but I know the kid desearves his fame.
<DrSteveSCARz|Modding> And im back from unfreezing my laptop
<Pikachu> mentalyeffedguy: eyyup
<Eli> AJIsAwesome|Homework: if you roughly translate "tolerate" to "ignore" i think everytroll deserves it :)
<mentalyeffedguy> Pikachu: i wish i could draw shits
<FlutterMEDIC> i said hi guys
<mentalyeffedguy> FlutterMEDIC: hay!
<tSparx> Eli: Roger Waters and David Gilmour have essentially retired into their solo careers, but David will sometimes tour with everyone from Floyd (except Roger Waters)
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> FlutterMEDIC: Hello!:)
<killerpony7733> Pikachu ya got a deviantart account?
<tSparx> She will take it back someday"
<Pikachu> killerpony7733: im going to
<DrSteveSCARz|Modding> and it works!
<Eli> tSparx: k... i never was much into them. their music is great but i just love seeing a band live too much :)
<Pikachu> killerpony7733: ill sign up affter im done
<Fluttershy0182> Hi, FlutterMEDIC!
<tSparx> Eli: Hah, I understand. Unfortunately for me, by the time I got into Pink Floyd (c. 2007), they weren't touring much and were EXPENSIVE AS HELL xD
<killerpony7733> Pikachu ah, well if you want another to draw to help you improve i can sign up for ya i got some ref of my OC
<LadyCanary> tSparx: See, I live in NY and there was a "The Wall" show to be played in July.
<LadyCanary> AND I COULDNT GO.
<Pikachu> killerpony7733: no its fine im going to do it now i guess XD
<Luggen> tSparx I love the idea :) I'll try and make it as good as possible ^^
<tSparx> LadyCanary: That's a bummer :( Though, tbh, I think The Wall is their most overrated album
<LadyCanary> True, but really fantastic.
<Luggen> Any stoner bronies? :3
<killerpony7733> Pikachu ah so want my ref quick then?
<DrSteveSCARz|Modding> uhh not me
<BoltzThePony> hi
<tSparx> Luggen: I have been known to smoke a few times.
<Eli> Luggen: not anymore, but i still have contacts if you need stuff :P
<DrSteveSCARz|Modding> im only 15 :P
<LadyCanary> tSparx: I actually got a really cool Wall patch for my backpack.

<tSparx> Luggen: Nobody's actually mad, nobody's getting permabanned :P
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CreeperPillow: not everyone.
<Reikim> i.e. Manechat on every single day.
<cowvarkian> CreeperPillow: because we can

<Masdragonflare> :o
<thelonepony> Bye
<Reikim> Did Buytoast get banned?
<crazypony> bye
<CreeperPillow> Bye RunningWild
<Reikim> I seem to remember that mods have been looking for an excuse for quite a while now.
<Luggen> I love the fact that you guys took time to explain it to me x3 You are going to be good parents :3
<thelonepony> :3 back from watching one piece
<Masdragonflare> wb thelonepony
<tSparx> Do we have any brony-parents in the house?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Luggen: I'm a parent?:O
<CreeperPillow> Luggen: This is Bronystate, sanity is nonexistant here
<tSparx> wb thelonepony :)
<Klumzeedragon> Shizuka: Remind me to buy some cider the next time I go out.
<Kandarihu> Most of the kicks are against a guy named otakon who tends to get excited a lot and starts saying lots of stuff at once. He gets kicked for spamming.
<tSparx> whoo, the banhammer has been put down... for now :)
<Reikim> Autokicked.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> thelonepony: Welcome back!:)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 25 % off on everything on greenmangaming why there are deals when i has no money
<Luggen> ajisawesome|homework Well that's nice :)
<alexxm> who got banned
<tSparx> dat otakon ota-kick :)
<CreeperPillow> Kandarihu: Don't forget that otakon doesn't even have to do anything just to get kicked
<Reikim> otakon has this weird love-hate affair with kickbots.
<Masdragonflare> I have been kicked for that as well but I just type fast :(
<tSparx> alexxm: Some kicks, 'cause Wrek felt like it :)
<alexxm> heh ok
<CreeperPillow> Reikim: Thus that fic was spawned
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> otakon X kickbot is now canon.:D
<thelonepony> otakon got kick?
<Reikim> I think it was...Murphy's Law?
<thelonepony> ^^
<CreeperPillow> ^^^
<Wrek> 05silyl buytoast
<tSparx> thelonepony: He's not even here, he just usually does get kicked :P
<Petrified_Discord> Insanity is not a state of mind. It is a place. I know this to be true, because I have been driven there. :)
<Wrek> 05unbanned him yet hes not back yet
<Wrek> 05oh well
<tSparx> buytoast got kicked, for proclaiming he's a deity
<thelonepony> tSparx eeyup :P
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Petrified_Discord: Same here.
<CreeperPillow> Oh he's back
<Wrek> 05no buytoast wasnt kicked ofr it
<tSparx> Petrified_Discord: Insanity is a song, by Oingo Boingo :)
<Buytoast> what now?
<Wrek> 05he got a 3 minute ban for it
<Wrek> 05ohai welcome back
<Luggen> So yeah, i have a question. I think Rainbowdash is the best pony cuz she is Free, Herself and fast as a racecar :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if something can go wrong it will ?
<Pinkie9164> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1895/
<Reikim> Or there was another
<tSparx> "Any Colour You Like" /Dark Side of the Moon/
<Luggen> Who is your favourite?
<Masdragonflare> I think so as well Luggen
<Kandarihu> Applejack
<Buytoast> what, my ban cause a stirrup?
<Wrek> 05twilight sparkle all the way
<CrimsonPhoenix> Luggen, that's no question
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Luggen: Applejack for me.
<Reikim> Ah
<Reikim> I prefer Finagle's law.
<Spectrum_Rush> Luna
<CreeperPillow> Luggen: Pinkie Pie
<CrimsonPhoenix> also Rarity is best pony
<Reikim> It states that "The perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum".
<Klumzeedragon> Buytoast: Nope. No one noticed until Wrek Said somehting.
<cowvarkian> lauren faust is best pony
<tSparx> Luggen: I am in a two-way tie between Twilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie (T-Sparx and P-Pie)
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix there we go!
<LucidDream> scootaloo is best chicken
<CrossChop114> Twilight Sparkle.
<CrossChop114> :3
<Reikim> Far stronger than Murphy's.
<Petrified_Discord> Crackle is best dragon
<Dken2021> I go for rarity, but applejack has barely little fans
<Luggen> tSparx Yeah i like twilight to, But i feel closer to rainbowdash in my personal style :3
<Buytoast> if your favorite horse isn't yellow quiet, i'm more dissapointed than usual at you
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Peewee is best Phoenix.
<tSparx> Luggen: But there isn't a pony I hate, and I like everyone but Trixy (Trixy is meh in my book)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yeah i know it adds "at the worse of moments"
<Masdragonflare> I convinced my brother in watching MLP
*cowvarkian likes trixy
<Masdragonflare> today :)
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Masdragonflare: How was his reaction?
<tSparx> cowvarkian: And that is your prerogative :)
<Luggen> Trixy is just missunderstood :c she needs our support to be able to meld in with normal conversation
<CrimsonPeewee> CrimsonPeewee is best Phoenix
<Masdragonflare> He was very busy working for hish school and I told him dude you should totally watch mlp
<CrossChop114> I was watching MLP the other day and my little brother said that it was "Okay." CLOSE ENOUGH!
<Reikim> Ah, no.
<Masdragonflare> he first laughed
<CrimsonPeewee> I think I'll use this name for a little while
<CreeperPillow> tSparx: Nobody likes Trixie except Sethisto
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ah yes
<Reikim> Finagle's law is more powerful than Murphy's law for other reasons.
<tSparx> CreeperPillow: Plenty of peeps like Trixie
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: You should.:D
<sub06905> only have one thing to say to everypony: http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g404/sub06905/yourbanned.jpg
<Buytoast> Lord Dragon Rider of Dickington should not be challenged
<Buytoast> nor should you mock Trixie in his presence
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also that one is O'Toole's
<Bronysith> lol
<Reikim> Specifically, it does not state that the worst thing possible will always happen.
<Luggen> Trixie is just missunderstood.
<Masdragonflare> but then he said he was gonna watch it while he was going on vacation in Spain (where he is now) where he will be watching it
<CrimsonPeewee> would use Philomena but I ain't a girl
<CrossChop114> *You're
<tSparx> "Brain Damage" /Dark Side of the Moon/
<CreeperPillow> tSparx: True....but she's just tame comapred to Diamond Tiara. That filly is just...eeeeviiil
<LadyCanary> YESS
<Petrified_Discord> CrossChop114: https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/8/23/1rGl_uU1F0KaEUy828Z0MA2.png
<BoltzThePony> hi
<Reikim> Finagle's Law allows for things to go right so that they will go wrong even more spectacularly later.
<CrimsonPeewee> DiamonTiara is best villain
<Dken2021> ello BoltzThePony
<CrimsonPeewee> She's the only one that's re-occuring
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I don't dislike any of the characters on the show, to be honest. They are who they are, and that's fine by me.:)
<CrimsonPeewee> think about it
<Reikim> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw
<Bronysith> CrimsonPeewee: thats not how you spell kefka
<CrossChop114> lol
<CrimsonPeewee> even M.A.Larson agrees
<tSparx> "Any colour you like," (prior song), "Brain Damage," (this song), and "Eclipse" (next song) are often called "The Dark Side Suite"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> murphys Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong
<CrimsonPeewee> Bronysith, I mean in MLP
<Masdragonflare> haha lol @ petrified_Discord
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> finagle Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Petrified_Discord: :D
<tSparx> Or just collectively reffered to as "Dark Side of the Moon"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> O'Toole's The perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum.
<Bronysith> CrimsonPeewee: you said best villain, not just mlp villain, she isnt even a villain, just an antagonist which is against a protagonist
<Reikim> Lies
<Reikim> "perversity" and "worst possible moment" are basically the same thing.
<Petrified_Discord> Aku is best villain
<Pinkie9164> Group hug! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1073/
<MadSurge> Eclipse played at the end of the Olympic opening ceremony :D
<Reikim> But I'm doing research right now to look at it.
<Wrek> 05http://e621.net/data/38/1e/381e38ce317b7382d89b197273f3a5df.jpg?1346699607
<Wrek> 05NEVER
<tSparx> Petrified_Discord: Uka Uka is best villian
<Reikim> Ah
<Luggen__> ö
<Reikim> Wikipedia claims that "Perversity" is known as the "O'Toole's Corollary"
<Dken2021> alright, kefka may be the craziest and loving villian, but he didn't really destroy anything, maybe rough up a few continents and made orphans, but not that much
<CrossChop114> I wub group hugs. I always get squashed in the middle. Curse my short stature.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek just linked inapropriate material? :D
<Petrified_Discord> tSparx: “I have heard enough of your shallow wisdom. It is I who is the strongest, and it is evil that will ultimately prevail!”
<Luggen__> What? My username is in use :c
<Reikim> So it's not a law on its own, it's a corollary of Finagle's.
<Luggen__> Inte me, Regular luggen
<Wrek> 05Luggen: give it am inute, then use /nick
<Reikim> And Finagle's is also a corollary of Murphy's.
<Reikim> So all three are the same thing.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and finagle's is a corollary of murphys
<tSparx> "Eclipse" /Dark Side of the Moon/ (Unofficially, Dark Side Suite, Part 3 of 3)
<Reikim> But then, this is Wikipedia, so take it with a grain of salt.
<spitfirecolt1> sweet pink floyd
<Dken2021> yup
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> better than tropes
<CrossChop114> Nom
<Masdragonflare> hahahaha :D
<spitfirecolt1> is this the whole concert
<Luggen__> Ok, yeah who exept me loves the music of TheLivingTombstone? *Fanboy*

<spitfirecolt1> i love the living tombstone
<CreeperPillow> Luggen: I like some of his stuff. I remember the first song I heard from him
<LadyCanary> @_@ Please dont link stuff during stream.
<Reikim> Hey
<Reikim> HEY
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I like ALL of the brony musicians. I just some MORE than others.

<Reikim> Tropes is quite good when it comes to media.
<Maid_RainBow> Shizuka : can i have some Cider?
<Reikim> Usually.
<Applejack2012> I love Tombstone
<MadSurge> Masdragonflare: MUCH better than the original strip :D
<Masdragonflare> haha :p
<Luggen__> I'm going to be one of the greatest of BronyMusicians
<Reikim> If it's something popular then it will normally be quite accurate as a result of the collective squabbling of every nerd on the Internet.
<Maid_RainBow> Tombie is good but i love Alex S is best pony
<ekips1> wow, I just finished watching this concert on youtube
<CrossChop114> Nom nom nom nom Ow! Bit a Popcorn Kernal.
<tSparx> LadyCanary: You can link stuff during stream, so long as that stuff is an image.
<ekips1> now I come to bronystate and see it again ^^
<Reikim> Truth is, after all, a side effect of conflict.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> ekips1: Welcome back!:)
<MadSurge> ^
<Reikim> Less popular things get less attention and thus languish.
<Dken2021> Luggen__ have any stuff to show off?
<Reikim> Example of the former: ponies.
<Luggen__> My cat is acting retarded ._.
<Dken2021> ello ekips
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the world is flat was popular
<Reikim> Hm?
<CreeperPillow> PinkiePieSwear is awesome. I love 'The Astronomer's Almanac To All Things Astronomy' with Makkon.

<Masdragonflare> Luggen I asume you're the one on the right?
<CrossChop114> I don't draw Ponies. I just draw my own OCs (Who are not ponies.)
<CrossChop114> lol
<luggen> Left x3w
<Meanwhile> Everyone on the planet should have Alien Swarm by now.
<Masdragonflare> Oh god

<Reikim> Damn

<Masdragonflare> bye Klumzee
<Masdragonflare> :3
<Reikim> I originally got it for the free hat, I'll be honest.
<Stallion_of_War> What're we watching?
<Reikim> Although I've had some fun times playing it.
<Dken2021> a pink floyd concert
<alexxm> compeutor derped
<Masdragonflare> It's a concert I think It's from pink Floyd
<luggen> So what do you think? I'ma link it one more time http://imgur.com/w84Iv
<LadyCanary> YAHOO!!!!!!!!!!!
<luggen> Good / Bad?
<Meanwhile> I haven't even gotten the hat and I've had the game since it came out.
<Dken2021> luggen it's nice
<Masdragonflare> âgreed
<Reikim> What
<CrossChop114> @luggen, It's good. :3
<Reikim> How does that even work?
<Masdragonflare> Do you play violin Luggen?
<Reikim> Did you not play it?
<Dken2021> all of those lights!
<Stallion_of_War> I don't know what it is, but it'
<Masdragonflare> Your cute mark says so :)
<CrimsonPeewee> Good drawing
<Stallion_of_War> it's well done
*LadyCanary applauds
<CrimsonPeewee> but why is your face red
<Meanwhile> I did but I think you need to do an online mission for it and whenever I tried to go online it crashed.
<Stallion_of_War> lol brain damage concert
*Masdragonflare Does the same thing
<alexxm> good concert
<CrimsonPeewee> and why is your friend....stitched?
<Reikim> Huh, that's odd.
<luggen> I dont play violin but I've been playing guitar for 12 years :)
<ingwaz> luggen: the quality is good, but i'm guessing i'm missing something otherwise the red face brown body pony and stitched together pony dont make much sense
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i never found someone online
<Meanwhile> Forever a T.
<Masdragonflare> ohhh it looked like a violin :)
<CrossChop114> I mostly just draw on Flipnote Studio. The low quality doesn't really help, but it's my only way to make my art public right now.
<Stallion_of_War> Frankenhooves?
<Reikim> Well, if Trix downloads it, I can run a server.
<luggen> ingwas: It's me and my friend :
<CrossChop114> All my DeviantART artwork is OLD.
<Masdragonflare> I think you're blushing
<Kandarihu> CrossChop114, what about GIMP?
<Reikim> Although it'll come darn near to burning out my little laptop.
<Masdragonflare> :p
<Masdragonflare> on the picture that is ^^
<CrimsonPeewee> luggen, would you mind explaining the.....oddities of these ponies?
<Lil_B> wrek I have a question
<Wrek> 05i cant feel ym ears
<Wrek> 05oh well
<Reikim> Hell, I've been looking for other people to play with for ages.
<ingwaz> luggen: well, stitched together pony i can see some reasoning behind, but why is the one pony's face red while the body is brown?
<Wrek> 05hope you enjoyed wreks concert mareathon
<Stallion_of_War> I want to learn how to use a freeware art program. I really want to draw Flutteros
<luggen> crimsonpeewee: what? x3
<Dken2021> Wrek excellent
<LadyCanary> Thank you Wrek!!!!!!!
<Reikim> I've got literally one other friend who plays it, so we got screwed on most missions.
<Masdragonflare> ingwaz I think he's blushing
<CrossChop114> @Kandarihu: I have Photoshop and 2 other softwares, but my computer is busted. I need a new one unlike this one which won't work with my tablet.
<Stallion_of_War> I probably would have, but I arrived at for the last two minutes
<Kandarihu> Wrek, thank you for streaming
<Meanwhile> Clearly we all have to go play it now then.
<Lil_B> (before the question) thanks, it was awesome Wrek :)
<Reikim> Face-raped by green, stabby aliens.
<CrimsonPeewee> the red head on a brown body and the hind leg stitch on your friend
<Reikim> This could work
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Feel up to reinstalling AS?
<luggen> ingwaz: My face is generally red x3
<CrimsonPeewee> Very nice drawing but the color scheme is quite horrible
<Masdragonflare> luggen: oh? I tought you were blushing
<CrossChop114> http://crosschop114.deviantart.com/#/d508duj I mostly draw monsters. :3
<CrimsonPeewee> that is a nice shade of red why not the whole body?
*Stallion_of_War daribot
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> will do but it will take a while
<PsychoticDoc> meow
<ingwaz> luggen: that particular part just seems kind of off considering ponies have fur. i dunno, its your oc so if its what you like and want, its good
<Reikim> Stallion_of_War: Paint Tool SAI, go now, it's so freaking easy.
<Reikim> np
<luggen> masdragonflare: Yeh I'm not x3 the reason to me being red is that i don't blush :'3
<Stallion_of_War> Fluttershy's comb is perfect for my goatee
<Reikim> Meanwhile can use the time to GET SOME GODDAMN SLEEP.
<trollghost> someone shoudl stream the new doctor who episode even though it was terrible
<CrimsonPeewee> luggen, why not the whole body red?
<CrossChop114> Is nothing streaming right now?
<Meanwhile> If I go to sleep now I'll wake up in a year.
<Masdragonflare> he didn't make it CrimsonPeewee
<CrimsonPeewee> it's a very nice shade and that could fit more
<DrSteveSCARz> hey everypony is anything streamin'
<Meanwhile> Meaning I'll have missed the game.
<Masdragonflare> his friend did
<luggen> Cuz i didn't want it all red? :)
<Dken2021> hello DrSteveSCARz
<Meanwhile> Unless T has really slow downloads.
<Masdragonflare> I think he said that
<Reikim> You should still...take a nap, or something.
<CrimsonPeewee> but it looks very very odd
<Reikim> Although it could be worse, at least you're still coherent.
<Bunny_Striker> nice to be back again
<luggen> I didn't make it and she who made it is awesome ^^
<Dken2021> hai Bunny_Striker
<CrossChop114> We need some music all up in heeyah.
<Bunny_Striker> sup
<CrimsonPeewee> I've never seen a pony in the show with two seperate colors for the coat
<Stallion_of_War> Doesn't pip have two colours?
<Lil_B> Wrek I was on a Meetup recently, and the one hosting it said he wants to make a international Meetup in the future, he already contacted People in other European countries
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Reikim> :kickcount otakon
<BerryPunch> Reikim: otakon has been kicked 11 times
<CrimsonPeewee> Stallion_of_War, touche.....
<Serenity> I'm back from crazy Cry of Fear shenanigan
<CrimsonPeewee> but then again they made it fitting
<Reikim> Well that's going to go up pretty quickly.
<Reikim> :kickcount Reikim
<BerryPunch> Reikim: Reikim has been kicked 3 times

<tSparx> Haha, 0 kicks = success :P
<trollghost> :roll
<Serenity> I know DCD has a habit of kicking me for no reason because he feels like it
<trollghost> and the chat pauses on my fail.
<Meanwhile> Personally that mental image is adorable.

<trollghost> so is anyone in here a good builder in minecraft?
<Buytoast> well
<Buytoast> i did not expect that
<Reikim> I though we established the inherent danger of getting anywhere near 4chan's genitalia?
<CrimsonPeewee> CrossChop114, is that.....
<Lil_B> well... appearently Wrek is afk :(
<thelonepony> Caramel

<Caramel> well now, let's see if within my alloted stream time, we can finish the last two levels!
<Caramel> yay!
<Meanwhile> Und dann Val, allo.
<Caramel> yo
<Dken2021> hai Caramel
<Serenity> CrossChop114: I didn't cry, but that's mainly because I've trained myself not too, plus I never was big into Pokkymans
<Applejack2012> How was PSP connected?
<Masdragonflare> brb
<Caramel> heya
*Bunny_Striker chomps on Serenity
<Reikim> Shizu made a comment about what sleeping with 4chan would be like.
<CrossChop114> Pokkymans
<trollghost> produced by mannco bandai games
<Kandarihu> Caramel, I'm getting buffering
<Applejack2012> I own a PSP
<DoctoDoctorWho> who's OC?
<Shizuka> 13what
<Reikim> It was along the lines of "Wouldn't you be scared of getting some sort of disease?"
<Reikim> And then you said
<Buytoast> this that gundam show?
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: caramels
<Kandarihu> Otherwise, I'm enjoying the intro.
<DoctoDoctorWho> thought so...
<Dken2021> DoctoDoctorWho you don't recognize Caramel from the show?
<Reikim> "I'd be more afraid of losing something than picking something up."
<Reikim> Or something like that.
<Meanwhile> Sounds like something I'd say.
<Reikim> Something to do with teeth.
<tSparx> :kickcount BerryPunch

<CrossChop114> Robots! :D

<Reikim> I wonder what other commands BP has.
<CrossChop114> http://crosschop114.deviantart.com/art/Robot-Escape-301470487 I LOVE drawing robots!
<Reikim> :bancount
<Kandarihu> DoctoDoctorWho, Michael Bay should be kept away from these robots.
<Reikim> :bancount otakon
<Reikim> Damn
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> @BerryPunch kill
<Reikim> No dice there.
<Meanwhile> I doubt anything interesting.
<MadSurge> Caramel stream! :O
<Reikim> Of course.
<Reikim> Otherwise we'd have another Steven Magnet.
<CrimsonPeewee> CrossChop114, nice basic talent but you definitely need a lot of practice
<Applejack2012> And keep Bay from ponies
<Pinkie9164> Lyra!
<CrossChop114> Yeah. That picture's old.
<CrimsonPeewee> CrossChop114, may I see one of your recent?
<CrossChop114> I haven't updated DeviantART in forever. Sowwy.
<Reikim> "Steven Magnet suddenly appears, rapes the chat for 10 minutes, and then goes back to sleep for another year."
<thelonepony> Sea Pony Lyra!
<alexxm> double teamed
<trollghost> :kickcount BerryPunch

<GLaDOS> hi
<Reikim> I remember someone saying that.
<trollghost> woah
<CrossChop114> I can't use my tablet on this laptop.
<DoctoDoctorWho> go go power rangers!
<Meanwhile> Fairly accurate description.
<CrimsonPeewee> You don't need dA to show a recent picture
<trollghost> BerryPunch speaks to themselves in the 3rd person
<Pinkie9164> GLaDOS!
<GLaDOS> PINKIE
<Applejack2012> She needs Megan
<CrimsonPeewee> I hope HotBloodedPinkiePie is DLC in that game
<GLaDOS> what are we watching
<CrossChop114> Since my laptop broke, I've only been using Flipnote Studio, which has so many limitations.
<trollghost> GLaDOS i love you
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: NO!
<trollghost> touch me
*alexxm pokes trollghost
<CrossChop114> Only 4 colors, small screen size, and everything is pixelated.
<GLaDOS> thank u trollghost
<DoctoDoctorWho> GLaDOS: robots killing eachother, have fun
<trollghost> touch me GLaDOS
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wizard Riding a Unicorn on a Rainbow in Space so much win http://derpy.me/jdSI7
<Kandarihu> It just buffered for a long time, then skipped to dialog
<Kandarihu> Oh well.
<Reikim> So I'm scrolling through this newest DrawFriend
<Applejack2012> on good ole PSP Glados
<Reikim> Suddenly I see a saucy pic of Twilight making out with Celestia.
<GLaDOS> i already get to watch robots kill eachother every day of my existance
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Walking away from that now.
<GLaDOS> except mostly its accdental
<Serenity> Yep. I'm back, and I'm still dry
<CrossChop114> "accidental"
<DashWithRainbows> EQD?
<Masdragonflare> ooh hey GLaDOS °-°
<GLaDOS> like when the orange one gets off the panel while the blue one is under a door
<Masdragonflare> funny name :)
<Reikim> Yep
<Bunny_Striker> I`m still a bunny
<DashWithRainbows> Ah.
<CrossChop114> I can't read this! *tableflip*
<GLaDOS> then i have to rebuild the blue one
<DashWithRainbows> I remember it was pretty much SFW stuff only
*Masdragonflare hugs CrossChop114
<Caramel> meh, since you can't read it, I'll skip past it
*CrossChop114 accepts hug.
<trollghost> Caramel: we are all peasents as we cannot read japanese
<Reikim> They usually hide sauciness behind links.
<Meanwhile> Except for that one time that had an image swiftly replaced with the words "I thought it was mud!"
<Obsidian> Hello everypony
<Reikim> Usually this consists of ponies in lingerie.
<trollghost> sup Obsidian
<CrossChop114> Needs more explosions! KABOOM!
<DashWithRainbows> Yep.
<Reikim> And then sometimes stuff slips by.
<DoctoDoctorWho> so we will all stare at lyra instead, yay illiteracy!
<Reikim> I remember once a FlutterMaid plot got by and never got commented upon.
<CrossChop114> I've been playing Dragon Quest VIII. It's a damn good RPG.
<Applejack2012> Me know no Japanese
<Lil_B> hi Obsidian :)
<kirz> they used to hide the nsfw stuff
<Applejack2012> hi
<Reikim> At the same time, a merely semi-saucy pic of Vinyl and Tavi got hidden.
<DashWithRainbows> That was back when I used to go on EQD. I haven't touched that site since earlier January.
<alexxm> how you doing Obsidian
<CrossChop114> Super Robot Wars? That's what it is?
<CrossChop114> :3
<DashWithRainbows> Honestly, EQD turned shit.
<Sumica> 00,10just a few enemys
<Obsidian> alexxm: doing alright
<Reikim> It kind of did, just a bit.
<CrossChop114> HEADS
<Buytoast> goddamn it sounded like a bunch of cicadas during mating season
<GLaDOS> who can trasnlate this
<Reikim> I only sometimes browse back there when daribot posts a link and I'm bored.
<trollghost> me
<CrossChop114> "Moon"
<Reikim> Anyway, this is the pic.
