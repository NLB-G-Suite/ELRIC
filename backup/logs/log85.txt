<mib_h2zwz3> 5wait, can anon be in the lottery? (colored for importance)
<GoldenDragon> So many choices
<Elky> heh

<BronyBrian> animal farm
<Axe-Handler> GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE GUYS
<EspyLacopa> Tyranico: Hence, I'll be going with Grave of the Fireflies.
<RandomExtra> Wicker Man's Already reserved for something else
<LordEchimaru> REDCLIFF
<Dashie> Kill Bill?
<a041744> Mods said nope on wicker man
<Anonoma> Do we only watch PG-13 or lower movies here?
<Hipster_Brony> basically, he banned everyone from entering this room, then put exemptions on us
<Combustiblelemons> Wicker man is reserved for a special occasion
<Slythemagicunicorn> THE ROOM, aka the worst movie ever
<Apple_Bloom> Hi, and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after 9 years in developement, hopefully it will be worth the wait.
<Aponymous> KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE

<everfreenights> CLOOOOWNS
<Axe-Handler> THE ROOM OH YES
<Combustiblelemons> The room has already been shown
<Angel_Espeon> 13It makes me think I'm wasting electricity .w.
<nah> @mib_h2zwz3 probably, and colours are just for mods.
<eat911> I think Blazing Saddles would be a good choice. they are apparently a lot of references to that movie in mlp
<a041744> R movies have been on before
<Dee_Twenty> We already did the Room.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> As far as I know, any rating goes, Anonoma
<Apple_Bloom> Hi, and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after 9 years in developement, hopefully it will be worth the wait.
<mib_6v1fd8> IT by stephen king

<ghostyTrickster> TRADE HATS FOR GAMES ~ Valve
<Slythemagicunicorn> I MISSED THE ROOOM?
<DareDreamer> Little Shop of Horrors would be nice!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Except perhaps NC-17
<Slythemagicunicorn> awww
<Pinkamina> Whoever said something about me being a murderer because of my name... lol
<FreezeFrame> eat911: Yes, yes there are.
<turtaguin> 0how about fight club?
<lossthief> BIRDEMIC
<Combustiblelemons> B movie = low budget, so bad it's good and corny acting
<Tyranico> So many people want to choose Studio Ghibli movies. It just makes me happy. ^_^
<YusukeKomiya> Oklahoma
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Blazzing Saddles is a great choice
<ChaoMing> Sup bros, what did I miss?
<InsertKeksy> Hi and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after over9000 years in development i hope its been worthe the wait
<[ger]Brony1> Well, i have still 24 April Foals story to read up.
<Anonoma> The Room would be great
<YusukeKomiya> Or Camelot
<COlimar788> Hat Fortress 2 is the best hat simulator
<PeanutButterWolf> So, No The Serbian Movie?
<mib_h2zwz3> 0oh, ok. Did that count as my second warning?... :/ aww
<sotha> I can't wait.
<Combustiblelemons> thankyou derp
<Hipster_Brony> 8anon: in the future, just PM either me or ghosties if you have questions instead of using colors
<herospirit> I just learned about Brony Movie Night halfway through "The Island Earth"
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Not the lottery, ChaoMing. :D
<Darf14> B movies must be either, bad, cheesy, bad box office profit
<sotha> I have a list of movies.
<herospirit> :0
<Roan> Seriously. Mindgame or Stalker.
<nah> we already watched the room
<pony_why> I'm still going with anything tron related
<turtaguin> 0fight club!
<Madadude> 0Blazzing Saddles would be perfect for a movie
<RanYakumo> Ghosties If someone gets chosen to do a movie, is said person responsible for setting it up come Friday and Saturday?
<FreezeFrame> Any Mel Brooks movie is awesome, though.
<Pinkamina> do NOT discuss anything RELATED to that horrible fanfic that is the worst thing ever
<Dave_BroZilla> Would b-movie also be considered critical success, commercial failure?
<Aurora> 6well you can turn of the monitor if you want
<Slythemagicunicorn> Did ya guys do Bladerunner or Escape from New York
<Ghosties> 4@Cobalt: A "B/cult" film would have to fit in with the four guidelines: art house, cheap, cult status, just a bad film all around
<Stargazer> B movie? Buckaroo Banzai
<Apprentice1994> I would also vote for Blazzing Saddles
<Apple_Bloom> Hi, and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after 9 years in developement, hopefully it will be worth the wait.
<Aurora> 6off
<nah> worth the weight
<Axe-Handler> LABYRINTH
<Aurora> 6I've heard it's actually better to leave desktop towers on lol
<NewDCD> 9okay gents
<Apple_Bloom> I vote for Team Fortress 2
<mib_7ogy4m> Twilight would be a perfect B-Movie.
<Madadude> 0Blazzng Saddles is easily a Cult Status
<FreezeFrame> :P
<everfreenights> MEL BROOKS OR STUDIO GHIBLI WILL BE EXCELLENT CHOISES
<Jon> Can I ask a question
<Ghosties> 4No, RanYakumo, the mods get the movies
<Aurora> 6dun remember where I heard that
<Axe-Handler> TWILIGHT LMAO
<PeanutButterWolf> If I was a mod, I'd say No to the Serbian Movie
<ChaoMing> all of a sudden, music
<RanYakumo> Okay.
<Anonoma> Team Fortress 2 would be an incredibly boring movie
<Jon> is iron giant a b film?
<RanYakumo> Thanks.
<Darf14> A good example for a B movie would be The Room and Machete
<techdude300> needs inception music
<a041744> Darm it apple bloom and your TF2
<YusukeKomiya> thats bIG o
<Slythemagicunicorn> This music is familiar
<nah> @mib_7ogy4m haha noooooooooooooo
<Combustiblelemons> *crosses fingers that blazing saddles gets picked as A movie*
<Mush> Portal the Movie?
<Apple_Bloom> Indeed.
<Lukem1999> Twilight? WTF?
<pony_why> oh yes Twilight would be perfect for a B movie
<YusukeKomiya> Love that Big O showtime
<Hipster_Brony> 8Jon: nope
<HaveTubaWillTravel> No waaaay, Jon D:
<Dave_BroZilla> Dat Zelda (I think)
<[ger]Brony1> I am going to burn down your house with lemons, anon, if you choose Twilight
<ChaosRising> 0the little engin that could
<Dermathil> I be 'round here btw.
<[NLR]Lucid> What about the newer Death Race?
<a041744> Sounds like Super Mario Galaxy
<TimeForPoniesAwYeah> Would Young Frankestein work for a B movie?
<COlimar788> Team Fortress 2 would be an amazing movie
<turtaguin> 0fight club!
<techdude300> Twilight is a B movie
<Apple_Bloom> Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
<Dermathil> Just not wantin' t' be kick'd
<Dashite> combustiblelemons that was my choice until after it came on tv the other day
<Apprentice1994> No Twilight, please dear god
<YusukeKomiya> Big O Noir/Giant Robots
<mib_cqaefq> i would love iron giant
<sotha> What is this music from?
<nah> already watched young frankenstein
<Dave_BroZilla> Naw, not happy enough for SMG
<Gentlecolt> true
<Ghosties> Banned all users except for us? Neat
<haHAh> :O
<Guyandsam> >>
<naufrago> Blazing saddles, definitely
<Zanzi> Would machete count as a "b" movie?
<sotha> Oh yes. Big O
<RandomExtra> Young Frankenstein was already done
<Gentlecolt> tf2 the movie
<DaieKorosu> not twilight
<RanYakumo> Darf14 Another good example would probably be A Serbian Film, but anyone who wants to watch that here is just a plain out sadist.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> We already saw Young Frankenstein too lol
<Honeydew> Is Scott Pilgrim going to be played tonight???
<Apple_Bloom> Are you or are you not going to stay for brunch
<Gentlecolt> THE PYRO IS REVEALED
<ChaosRising> 0indpendence day
<NeedsMorePony> Kingdom hearts would be the greatest movie in existence
<Gentlecolt> AS
<everfreenights> HELL NO, young frankenstain would not be a B movie
<Gentlecolt> A
<Hipster_Brony> eeeeeeeeyup
<mib_0kb6z3> I vote Sharktopus for B movie
<COlimar788> It's not Galaxy, but it definitely has a Galaxy-ish vibe
<Combustiblelemons> ahh damn it dashite >.<
<ghostyTrickster> I would guess Twilight would have some hilarity potential
<sotha> Big O has some good music
<Gentlecolt> Flergerndargeep
<DAT_PON-3> A movie choices: Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Battle Royale, Donnie Darko
<Silvermare> NeedsMorePony, that'd be epic
<InsertKeksy> 201 bronies

<Apple_Bloom> Dear Twilight, Don't write to me again or I will cut you Sincerely, Princess Celestia
<Axe-Handler> I'll be fine, Nega Scott seems like a cool guy.

<FreezeFrame> Talk about overkill
<Barry> I find it boring, too
<Purple`Prose> MOAR GRENADES
<NewDCD> 9"Shut Up, Hannibal! (Uncountable, but the best one has got to be the final scenario to the End of Evangelion story, where Shinji not only rejects Instrumentality, but also his father Gendo, asserting he's his own person. In fact, that entire scenario was one MASSIVE invoking of this trope, and a Crowning Moment of Awesome, seeing as how the Alpha Numbers are
<Kenzamaka> I was never into giant robot stuff.
<Solarboy> )':
<ValtheJean> dat boob animation
<mib_vzvt1c> wow?
<Aaron8777> ugh really
<Kenzamaka> And I always turned the animations off in Fire Emblem.
