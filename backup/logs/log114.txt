<Cat> sod off strange person
*Ali1017 hands Tavi 500 points for trying.
<Sumica> Hard to know what you ment when I was using my point of context.
<Fluttershy> Well I knew flapjacks and pancakes weren't the same thing, but I've never had flapjacks. I've had crepes though
<prince-dari> Dashite: Nope.
<Fluttershy> =w=;
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts Am live here
<Dashite> Eeeyup

<prince-dari> Which was what I was asking.
<DaRe-DeViL> :X
<Dashite> No you didn't/.
<Dermathil> ohai prince-dari
<Lemon_Lime> Whatcha gonna be streaming?
<VioletVanilla> 6Eelol~
<Spyrorocks`> stop.
<Dashite> You're changing the question now.
<prince-dari> Those are pancakes, specifically American pancakes.
<RobotPinkie> you're specifically asking Americans, prince-dari
<Sketchy_Sounds> Me singing.
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` listen me i m stopping
<Cat> why does this channel not hand out ops and hops so annoying people can be kicked?
<DaRe-DeViL> thi
<DaRe-DeViL> this
<Lemon_Lime> Ah
<Sketchy_Sounds> Some pony songs, some non-pony.
*Fluttershy giggles.
*VioletVanilla giggles
<Fluttershy> RobotPinkie has a point.
<prince-dari> I asked what you thought a flapjack was.
<Spyrorocks`> Cat, just not really active I suppose.
<Dashite> You asked "<prince-dari> What a flapjack is?"
<prince-dari> I'm English.
<Octavia> huh, no ad
<Cat> D:
<Octavia> i am confuse.
<Dashite> You didn't specify a cultural context.
<prince-dari> So therefore I mean the English meaning of flapjack.
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks`
<Dashite> Therefore you are wrong.
<Cat> but kicking is fun and educational!
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` Listen
<prince-dari> No.
<Dashite> Yup
<prince-dari> It's called inference.
<Sumica> Hey dari want some Rocky Mountain Oysters?
<prince-dari> Use some.
<prince-dari> I'm English.
<Cat> jesus, is Navi from Ocarina of Time on here?
<Spyrorocks`> Stop nicklalerting me.
<prince-dari> I use the English words.
<DaRe-DeViL> y r u not lsten me
<prince-dari> Sumica: Lawl.
<Dashite> And you were asking Americans.
<prince-dari> That's the whole point Dashite.
<Spyrorocks`> Say what you have to say already
<prince-dari> You're Americans, I want to know what you think our ENGLISH words mean.
<Spyrorocks`> or are you just going to keep on saying listen.
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks`
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks`
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks`
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks`
<DaRe-DeViL> y r u not lsten me
<DaRe-DeViL> y r u not lsten me
<DaRe-DeViL> y r u not lsten me
<prince-dari> That's why I'm asking, duh.
<johnsey|AFK> cscope -R -b
<RobotPinkie> there was no such premise to the question, duh :P
*Fluttershy hugs prince-dari
<johnsey|AFK> eh wrong window
<Dashite> You asked someone from America what a Flapjack is. They use the word for something else. Therefore they will tell you what the cultural context for them is. You can't then turn around and say they were wrong.
<Sumica> What do you meen you people....wait that doesn't work here.
<Spyrorocks`> DaRe-DeViL, if you dont stop there will be gline.
<Spyrorocks`> so stop now.
<prince-dari> I just did, because they misinterpretted my question.
<Octavia> guitar is killing your vocals today
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` Answer my question
<Dashite> Because you didn't provide enough information.
*Fluttershy hugs Dashite and Sumica as well. "Nooo... love an tolerate...!" >_<
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` I wAnt IRco
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` I wAnt IRcop

<DaRe-DeViL> :D
<Cat> can we gline him now?
<Sumica> lol it's all good Fluttershy, I am not arguing here just snarky.
<Zorotokon> Speaking of musics.
<Pinkie_Pie> I shall aquire Clapfakes

<prince-dari> No I didn't.
<DaRe-DeViL> Cat :@
*DaRe-DeViL slaps Cat around a bit with a large trout
<prince-dari> You are meant to understand the question.
<Cat> >.>

<Dashite> Which isn't possible if you don't provide enough specifics.
<Octavia> flutterguy it!
<prince-dari> Lawl.

<VioletVanilla> 6ARE YOU A SPY?!?!?!
<Sumica> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE7CEycI7nc
<Dashite> Flapjack = Pancake is a perfectly valid response to "What is a flapjack."
<DaRe-DeViL> hey listen
<DaRe-DeViL> u can not
<DaRe-DeViL> gline
<prince-dari> Not given the context.
<DaRe-DeViL> bcoz m proxy
<DaRe-DeViL> user
<VioletVanilla> 6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapjack
<Octavia> hit that note!
<Octavia> or ill spank you!
<Dashite> The context being you asked Americans.
<Fluttershy> BRB guys
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` so many glines
<Spyrorocks`> Easy enough.
*Spyrorocks` adds dnsbls
<DaRe-DeViL> n i will connected
<Dashite> Who use the term Flapjack = pancake.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Classtime, gotta go.
<VioletVanilla> "Flapjack may refer to
<prince-dari> The context being I use UK English words.
<VioletVanilla> A thick pancake, referred to as this particularly in United States and Canada
<VioletVanilla> Flapjack (oat bar), a sweet bar made from oats and golden syrup in British cuisine"
<prince-dari> Not American words.
<Cat> what be that, Spyrorocks`?
<Octavia> yay~ close enough
<Cat> Hi DarkTruth!
<Cat> :)
<prince-dari> So it's stupid to assume that I'd be using an American word there.
<LvS> clap clap clap clap
<HotCocoa> Okay screw it
<Dashite> If you had asked a british person and they had said flapjack = pancake, then you could say they were wrong.
<HotCocoa> I hate feeling left out
<Octavia> you do very well
<Lemon_Lime> Sing Giggle at the Ghostie :D
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` if u r gline me then i will stating flooding
<DaRe-DeViL> n dwn server

<Spyrorocks`> so what?
<Cat> I do like fun
<Cat> :o
<Lemon_Lime> aww :9
<prince-dari> You didn't get the answer I was looking for - wrong.

<WhatPayne> wait what?
<Cat> I gotta be up proper early tomorrow morning to cat a train :<
<prince-dari> So tell me.
<prince-dari> What's an aubergine?
*VioletVanilla feels accepted as an individual by Dari for getting it right
<Spyrorocks`> cat a train
<Spyrorocks`> lol
<prince-dari> :>
<Dashite> We didn't get the answer you were looking for, but it was still a correct answer given the question you posed.
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks`
<Sumica> it's a word Dari!
<DaRe-DeViL> Spyrorocks` so Watch Flooding
<prince-dari> You got the wrong answer.
<Cat> well the train works out cheaper than going by car
<Dashite> It's a plant.
<DaRe-DeViL> I will Start
<DaRe-DeViL> FLooding
<RobotPinkie> That's so funny I forgot to laugh
<Spyrorocks`> so what?
<prince-dari> I don't care whether you think it's right or not.
<HotCocoa> What's he singing right now?
<Spyrorocks`> ill just go to mcdonalds.
<prince-dari> In my eyes.
<Lemon_Lime> Cupcakes!
<prince-dari> You were wrong.
<HotCocoa> Okay good
<RobotPinkie> well then your premise with asking was wrong
<Pinkie_Pie> Omg..
<Pinkie_Pie> ....
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.facebook.com/pages/Spitfire-Wonderbolt-Friendship-is-Magic/214255751932016
<Cat> it's not like you'd be disrupting a busy channel, DaRe-DeViL
<Dashite> Only because you didn't specify which version you were talking about.
<Pinkie_Pie> Look at the most recent post
<Octavia> hardcore remix dubstep!
<HotCocoa> You need a new mic.
<Cat> I fear your annoyances would fall on deaf ears
<VioletVanilla> 6In my newly painted fingernails-- Oooooo~ Shiny!
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Lemon_Lime> Dubstep!
<Spyrorocks`> lol
<Spyrorocks`> no one really cares
<Cat> yeah
<Spyrorocks`> its just a chatroom
<HotCocoa> If Sketchy_Sounds ever makes a REAL RECORDING of this music, someone will dubstep remix it.
<Pinkie_Pie> "Seems like everypony is getting sick lately"
<Pinkie_Pie> D=
<Lemon_Lime> Wha? Whats this>
<HotCocoa> Like, with a real mic
<Lemon_Lime> o.o
<Lemon_Lime> He wrote more lyrics? Thats ingenious.
<VioletVanilla> 6This is true Pinkie_Pie
<prince-dari> No one knows what an aubergine is?
<HotCocoa> Lemon_Lime: yeah
<Octavia> that is the rule of this community- provide 18 seconds of audio and there will be 48 dubstep remixes
<RobotPinkie> I know, yet I don't care :P
<HotCocoa> 2nd verse = Pinkie Pie's recipie from Applebuck Season
<prince-dari> Do you know what argy-bargy means?
<HotCocoa> 3rd verse = Applejack's bucked-up recipie
<HotCocoa> Hence "baked bads"
<Lemon_Lime> Ah
<Dashite> I told you, it's a plant.
*Octavia smahes her phone. Work, stupid.
<HotCocoa> Okay the stream is really, really shitty on my end
<Octavia> oh, not just me, then
<prince-dari> But specifically.
<Dashite> Eggplant.
<Hat> what stream :O
<Luna_In_Socks> Yes, it's a bit stuttery here.
<HotCocoa> No, it keeps cracking and breaking up
<Lemon_Lime> Yay!
<HotCocoa> http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts
<Dashite> And I've never heard the second term.
<DaRe-DeViL> WoOOw

*Luna_In_Socks covers her ears with her socked hooves to block out Sketchy's high notes
<prince-dari> How about clingfilm?
<VioletVanilla> 6I was talking to Sumica with that question Dari, but thank you~ ;3
<HotCocoa> Trying agian.
<HotCocoa> again
<Sumica> Seemed like you tryed to chage the topic VV
<Cat> I now know just how stupid the internet can make people
<Dashite> Saran wrap or equivalent I assume.
<Spyrorocks`> we have bpom enabled now
<Octavia> *^.^*
<Lemon_Lime> Hop skip and a jump? :D
<Spyrorocks`> he cant connect with proxy.
<HotCocoa> What is he giggling about?
<Cat> sweet
<prince-dari> Saran wrap? O_o Interesting word.
<HotCocoa> Never mind.
<Octavia> noooothing
<Spyrorocks`> that was a seriously sad flood.
*HotCocoa eyerolls.

<Lemon_Lime> Just move your little rump. - 3-
<prince-dari> Is that a brand name or
<prince-dari> Orh.
<prince-dari> Oh*
<Dashite> First thing that came to mind.
<Sumica> Brand name
<Sumica> bah
<Dashite> Plastic wrap
<Cat> I think he's the only person in that channel he's promoting
<Spyrorocks`> Aristeo, that flood almost brought the network down.
<Cat> he must be very lonely
<Lemon_Lime> Drat.
<prince-dari> Corriander?
<Luna_In_Socks> I can barely hear you, silly.
<Iks> omg a dude with a guitarr!
<Dashite> The herb?
<Octavia> hah
<RobotPinkie> are these all the things you couldn't answer at the latest pub quiz? :P
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<prince-dari> How about...
<HotCocoa> Iks: that's Sketchy_Sounds
<prince-dari> Chinwag?
<prince-dari> XD
<Octavia> sounds better
<Luna_In_Socks> Slightly!
<VioletVanilla> 6D;
<Cat> I just learned that ham is a term for the opposite of spam
<Cat> weird
<Spyrorocks`> lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy everyone
<Dashite> Never heard someone use that term. Apparently informal conversation though.
<Octavia> sweetie deerrreeellleeeee it!
<Cat> I'm not sure I trust wiki on that
<Cat> but whatevs
<Iks> i figured... since it says Sketchy_Sounds at the top
<prince-dari> Let's bring out the slang.
<prince-dari> This should be interesting. XD
<prince-dari> Lush?
<Octavia> wooooo!
<Lemon_Lime> Hell yeah!
<RobotPinkie> as a slang word? no clue
<Iks> the guitar kinda drowns out the voice
*Lemon_Lime head bops.
<VioletVanilla> 6A drunk person? :3
<Luna_In_Socks> This is what Scots Gaelic sound slike!??
<prince-dari> Nope.
<HotCocoa> Luna_In_Socks: yes. :P
<Dashite> I remember you saying no to that before.
<RobotPinkie> is this all british slang?
<prince-dari> It does mean drunk person, but as slang.
<Dashite> I don't remember what you said it was though.
<Octavia> saywha
<prince-dari> Lush is the only slang I've said now.
*Luna_In_Socks looks around for FallSilently
<Luna_In_Socks> Who?
<WhatPayne> I have slang word.
<Octavia> yay cmc!
*Luna_In_Socks puts on plastic moustache
<Luna_In_Socks> Whoo ees thees FallSilently?
<Ali1017> CMC?
*Sumica gets out the body armor.
<Iks> cutie mark crusaders!
<Sumica> this should be good.
<Iks> learn your acronyms!
<Ali1017> I know my acronyms
<prince-dari> Basically it just means something good, attractive, etc.
<prince-dari> "Amy is lush"
<VioletVanilla> 6Dari is lush~
<Octavia> sketchy is playing it on his stream
<Ali1017> I just wondered why it is randomly said
<prince-dari> "The salary of my new job is lush"
<prince-dari> Etc
<Ali1017> Ohhhhh
<mib_g5wsbl> direct the stream to here lol http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts
<Octavia> first time i have heard it played on a guitar
*Ali1017 tries to think of something funny to say to make him burst out laughing.
<Dashite> VioletVanilla doesn't quite understand the usage of the term lush. At least not the version Dari is using.
<prince-dari> 1) I don't think the stream is currently running
<Sumica> it's the UK version VV
<prince-dari> 2) Don't advertise without permission please
<VioletVanilla> 6jaja~ Dari is something good
<Dashite> Exactly. Those words don't go in the same sentence. :p
<Sumica> Nonsence I think the US version works for Dari at times too,
<Luna_In_Socks> I think he cheats by not reading this while singing.
<Lemon_Lime> I wanna sing with you so badly = 3=
<LvS> and now the ceiling falls down on you.
<Ali1017> probably
<Octavia> :D
<Dashite> :D

<Dashite> ^^^ Dari being wrong you mean. :p
<LvS> i don't, really.
<Octavia> i am sending him silly messages
<Ali1017> probably read a comment somewhere
<Iks> why not send them here
<prince-dari> Lawl Dashite, being ignorant you mean?
<RobotPinkie> nice work Fluttershy, or so I assume anyway
<VioletVanilla> 6I agree with you DE, victory! ;3
<Dashite> Yes, yes you are Dari. :p
<Octavia> because they are definitely not channel appropriate
<Iks> ohoo probably something perverted
<asdf> ._.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Because this room is PG rated is why X
<Ali1017> Haha, now I want to know.
<prince-dari> Hah, that's inventive.
<Sumica> Nice pic Fluttershy
<WhatPayne> If olive oil comes from olives, then where does baby oil come from?
<Leika> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Leika in a tight embrace
<Leika> :D
<VioletVanilla> 6Space.
<Octavia> and they are only funny because they are all in caps
<ValtheJean> baby olives
<Barry> lol
<prince-dari> Where's the slang word then?
*Ali1017 gasps
<Fluttershy> Yes, I drew the picture. ^^
<RobotPinkie> ohay ValtheJean
*DeniedExistenceMobile hugs VioletVanilla.
<LvS> do your arms feel any better now?
<ValtheJean> howdy robotpinkie
<Fluttershy> now I will be brbing again... d:
<Octavia> yessss gatg~~
<RobotPinkie> cya Fluttershy
<Iks> you rock... who-hoo
<Barry> The pic has Fluttershy holding a hand to her stomach. For what reason, I wonder.
<VioletVanilla> 6See you soon fluttershy~
<Octavia> he is going to laugh in a second
*VioletVanilla hugs Fluttershy~
<Octavia> see
<VioletVanilla> 6Get well soon
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Who knows barry
<Iks> and we will never know why
*VioletVanilla hugs DeniedExistence as well
<WhatPayne> cya
<Barry> I know one reason, but I doubt it's the case
<Pinkie_Pie> Bye Fluttershy
<Ali1017> I'm sure it's a fun comment Tavi sent him.
<Fluttershy> Haha, see you guys. And Barry, there is a reason... but I'll just leave you to speculate.
<WhatPayne> I wish I could draw...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Orly Barry? What would tgat be?
<Fluttershy> -yes, is trolling- bye for now!
<Octavia> hah, we have an inside joke we throw back and forth
<DeniedExistenceMobile> that*
<RobotPinkie> I'm guessing it's gas, Fluttershy, would that be correct?
<Barry> The only reason I know is that she's pregnant
<Lemon_Lime> aight, I need to wash up.
<Lemon_Lime> Keep on playing :D
<VioletVanilla> 6I am happy to be able to play all of the instruments I do, even though I can not draw.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Headphone*
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Lemon_Lime> See yall ponies later. o3o
<Barry> but like I said, I doubt that's the case
<LvS> bye
<Pinkie_Pie> I dont doubt it...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Or...maybe she's just hungry?
<WhatPayne> This is internet so only reason Human Flutterhy would be holding hand on stomach is because she's pregnant...
*Octavia smiles
<Octavia> that was pretty
<VioletVanilla> 6Ugh. . . Human fluttershy. . . <.<
<Sumica> Yeah I thought that too Barry, preg that is.
<VioletVanilla> 6BURN IT
*VioletVanilla is acting like Lauren Faust
<RobotPinkie> aw
<Zephirdd> wat
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I see VioletVanilla.
<RobotPinkie> lol Lauren Faust hates humanized ponies?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> IDK
<Zephirdd> where is it VioletVanilla
<Zephirdd> lol
<Octavia> oh wow, i was just goint to say to play this
<VioletVanilla> 6I am only kidding~ Apparently in an interview Lauren Faust said she severely dislikes humanized ponies or references to humanized things in general
<Iks> that sounds nice
<Barry> I wonder if Lauren Faust knows of this site?
<VioletVanilla> 6I will have to find it. .
<Zephirdd> wait
<Octavia> going* even
<Zephirdd> there is a site for humanized ponies?
<Zephirdd> or am I misinterpreting hard?
<VioletVanilla> 6I read it on EQD
<RobotPinkie> Faust only clops to ponies, clearly
<Sumica> I saw taht too VV Thought it was more along the lines of having them hold things as if they had hads.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> 0_o
<VioletVanilla> 6She didn't like the BridleMaids poster
<VioletVanilla> 6Because it was in "human-like poses"
<Barry> But she has the ponies stand on two legs for prolonged periods of time. Trixie for one comes to mind
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Insert shrugpony here*
<RobotPinkie> well, I can see that
<Zephirdd> she stands on two legs only for the show
<Zephirdd> and isnt for a prolonged period of time
<Zephirdd> only when there are fireworks
<JackiePie> Hi
<LvS> hi.
<Octavia> take that, billie joe
<ValtheJean> maybe she just hates bridesmaids :P
<ValtheJean> or whatever that show is called
<Barry> Holding a bouquet of flowers with her front legs while standing on her back legs, and using her front legs to summon them like a human magician comes to mind
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Eh...Well she DID play with ponies when she was young...
<VioletVanilla> 6JEAN VALJEAN <3
<ValtheJean> lol :P
<Sumica> If any thing Dash was doing human poses more then most. But only when flying/hovering.
<JackiePie> I'm watching the Looney Tunes show. Daffy even complains about the restroom key at an office.
<Zephirdd> oh
<ValtheJean> There is one thing I would like to mention about Bronies
<Dashite> Ohai Val
<JackiePie> "What, you think I'm going to steal your toilet?"
<Ali1017> this is hard to understand when you're only getting half of the conversation.
<Sumica> Oh hey ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> when compared to everyone else I usually converse with
<WhatPayne> Holy shi* I just remembered!
<Dashite> They are all totally nuts?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Yeah?
<ValtheJean> Brony's have a significantly higher percentage of actually getting my nick reference
*WhatPayne hugs Luna
<RobotPinkie> we're 20% cooler, val?
<Octavia> today, is gonna be the dsay o/~
<Zephirdd> sorry
<ValtheJean> that too
<Barry> Oh Shiitake mushrooms
<Zephirdd> I don't get it
<Zephirdd> =(
<WhatPayne> Phew
<Octavia> i totally got it
<ValtheJean> also ohai everyone who said hi
<Zephirdd> hi =p
<WhatPayne> Almost forgot hugs
<VioletVanilla> 6:3 We're just into movies and shows and stuff ;3
<Iks> course we know it
<Barry> Val, from Trigun?
<WhatPayne> Hellew
<ValtheJean> Barry, you're breaking the statistics curve!
<DeniedExistenceMobile> No, Val Valjean.
<Barry> I think he's from there, anyway
<Pinkie_Pie> Deied.. Bunker
<Pinkie_Pie> Denied*
<JackiePie> roflol, Daffy stole the toilet
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Hi
<Pinkie_Pie> Did Val lose his OP...?
<LvS> i don't, but i know next to nothing about music
<Barry> lol
<RobotPinkie> val valjean? wow, yeah I definitely didn't get it then
<ValtheJean> >yfw I've never even seen trigun
<DeniedExistenceMobile> No.
<Barry> Who's Val Valjean?
<ValtheJean> also that was a typo by Denied, it's JEAN ValJean
<Pinkie_Pie> Chanserv didnt give it to him though
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I don't think...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Ask him
<ValtheJean> he's the protagonist in Les Miserables
<Barry> fine, who's Jean Valjean
<RobotPinkie> only thing i think of is jean valjean, which is a reference that i imagine few get...
<RobotPinkie> oh lol
<Barry> ah
<Dashite> People don't get Jean ValJean?
<Aristeo> maps too == opposite of spam
<mattus701> hey
<ValtheJean> no, they don't get ValtheJean
<Pinkie_Pie> Val, Y U NO OP?
<Pontang> LOL, Les Miz. xD
<ValtheJean> because they think I'm talking about Jeans
<Pinkie_Pie> Also, I think Valerie Jean fits better
<Barry> never watched Les Miserables, but I did see Trigun a bit
<Pinkie_Pie> =P
<prince-dari> Val the pair of jeans.
<Barry> That's why I think it was from Trigun
<ValtheJean> @Barry it's also a book :P
<Barry> thought*
<RobotPinkie> >watched
<ValtheJean> and oh u dari :P
<LvS> hey.
<RobotPinkie> lawl
<Barry> lol
<FireLight> hi
<Charlie_Horse> Hi.

<Pinkie_Pie> Valthejean.. OP?
<Sumica> Hey Dari, I think i just found how you can start Your streaming.
<RobotPinkie> ohay again AllisZero
<Barry> I just thought of something. In Boast Busters, Applejack was a hypocrite.
*Luna_In_Socks likes watching Luney Tunes.
<AllisZero> Man, I'm getting so sick right now
<DeniedExistenceMobile> No purple text today Val?
<AllisZero> Just got approved for a car loan :(
<ValtheJean> I'm disguising myself as one of you
<ValtheJean> I ninjar like that
<JackiePie> It's the new Looney Tunes.
<AllisZero> But I'll never buy the car I want to
<JackiePie> but lol, Daffy actually stole a toilet
<Iks> rammstein! lol
<Pinkie_Pie> Val, I demand you show us color.. We need... Verification
<Luna_In_Socks> What'dshe say what'd she say!!!
<Octavia> what?
<Iks> what what did she request?
<Octavia> i said nothing
<LvS> can you play the one from the very beginning again?
<Iks> omg this is so frustrating
<ValtheJean> I take orders from nopony
<LvS> that was beautiful.
<Charlie_Horse> New Looney Tunes ain't bad.
*Luna_In_Socks stands behind Octavia, glowering adorably
<ValtheJean> except Luna, because she's so huggable
<JackiePie> What about Rammstein?
<Octavia> i said he should turn on a light
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I second that motion
<Octavia> seriously.
<LvS> aye
<Charlie_Horse> Certainly a thousand steps up from the things they were doing with them before.
<Iks> nothing jackie... go back to looney tunes
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Show us the colors
<Barry> She pretty much said she didn't like people who showed off, but she went on stage to try to upstage Trixie, and showed off herself.
<Zephirdd> speaking of which
<Iks> well i was kidding anyways
<LvS> oh, the music itself was nice enough
*Zephirdd hugs Luna
<prince-dari> Sumica: Huh?
<Luna_In_Socks> Sing Sea Ponies!
<Octavia> for pony tunes, play the Gala
<Ali1017> Pony song, WWU, although, that needs more singers though, I do enjoy listening to Winter Wrap Up.

<Octavia> LEARN IT
*Luna_In_Socks sets "record"
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince-Dari, is Valthejean still an OP?
<Octavia> do not make me get my piano out and somehow magically have streaming bandwidth
*Ali1017 isn't listening and is unsure of what is going on.
<Ali1017> :O
<RobotPinkie> :O
<Ali1017> That would be
<RobotPinkie> how quiet
*Ali1017 shifts into RainbowDash mode. "So Awesome!"
<ValtheJean> it's quiet on the western front

<LvS> hooray!
<Octavia> that is an old song, then
<Luna_In_Socks> Ah, I see I do.
<Luna_In_Socks> A true nerd uses software to check how bright it is.

*Fluttershy is hugged, sniffles
*Barry hugs VioletVanilla
<Fluttershy> Bye VioletVanilla ;w;
<WhatPayne> Good bye
<Octavia> wish i could do the vocals for you :/
<Octavia> *meow!*
*Barry is listening to Super PonyBeat
<Iks> i love the chorus
<Barry> Cya later, VioletVanilla
<Fluttershy> -gasps- I love the Super PonyBeat album... my favorite song is Luna (Dream Mode)
<Octavia> yay, this is my favorite portion
<Sumica> ^ second
<Barry> I'm currently on Fluttershy's Lullaby
<Fluttershy> Awww that one's fun too ^^
<johnsey|workmode> Octavia: how about recording them and then mixing them in manually next time? :D
<Barry> You know, out of the CMC, Apple Bloom's the only one who hasn't sung
<Octavia> yeah, you did
<LvS> yes, great song!
<Octavia> it is tricky
<Sumica> Not sure if want.
<Barry> You don't know if you want to hear Apple Bloom sing?
<ValtheJean> technically she sang that one little quick verse in practice
<Octavia> yay~
<ValtheJean> but no serious songs
<Barry> True, but she didn't have any singles
<Iks> yay
<LvS> now that's dedication
<Iks> cant wait for RDs part
<Sumica> Correct Barry, it could go really wrong.
<johnsey|workmode> yay i found a pair of headphones
<Octavia> i have a feeling im going to have to learn to play this
<Barry> Well, since Apple Bloom's VA is Sweetie Belle's singing VA, how bad could it go?
<Barry> AB can't be any worse than Scoots
<Barry> or maybe she could, I don't know
<Barry> Nah
<Fluttershy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG8V_rs6e7E
<Iks> sketchy needs too
<Crainy> crap
<Crainy> Space Marine still hasnt arrived
<Sumica> Yeah they may share a va but so dose RD and AJ. people like RD's singing but not AJ's
<Barry> True
<Zephirdd> really?
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<Zephirdd> imo both have good songs D:
<Barry> I wonder what people have to say about Twi's singing?
<Octavia> johnsey|workmode, wish there was a way to better colaborate over the net
<Zephirdd> Twi's singing is fucking awesome
<Zephirdd> at least on winter wrap up
<Iks> its tough with audio and video cause of the sync issues
<Barry> That's really the only time she sang
<Fluttershy> <3 Winter Wrap Up song...
<Iks> but isnt google working on some stuff? google wave or something
<Zephirdd> Galla?
<FireLight> dumb internet -.-
<Barry> It and At the Gala were the only songs that featured the entire main cast
<Octavia> :)
<Octavia> suuure
<Fluttershy> Love BOTH of those songs~
<Sumica> Personaly I like Aj's singing but I see them having appleblloms singing being much like scoots.
<Barry> You mean where the VA is forced to sing badly?
<Sumica> Yep
<johnsey|workmode> Octavia: well yeah, as long as your bandwidth and latency allows it, it should be possible
*Octavia looks at her cellphone having a meltdown
<Octavia> Nope.
<Barry> I really hope the developers of FiM release a correct version of the Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
<Barry> and by correct, I mean with the singer using her talent, instead of being forced to sing badly
<Sumica> They have one they just did't use it. and yes hope it gets out to us.
<Crainy> johnsey|workmode!
<Barry> I think it was the VA's idea to sing badly, anyway
<johnsey|workmode> well 3g isn't really known for good latency
<Zephirdd> oh oh oh oh
<Zephirdd> maybe
<Zephirdd> maybe
<Zephirdd> see
<Zephirdd> listen guys
<johnsey|workmode> Crainy: i'm not really here
<Zephirdd> maybe
<Crainy> why not?
<Zephirdd> maybe the cmc
<johnsey|workmode> whaddya want
<Zephirdd> like
<johnsey|workmode> kidding!
<johnsey|workmode> sup?
<Zephirdd> maybe they sing again
<Zephirdd> and then
<Zephirdd> see see
<Zephirdd> they do it right
<Crainy> you posted an awesome pinkemina pic while i was at work
<Crainy> i want it!
<Crainy> NAOW
<Zephirdd> and the song is actually good
<Zephirdd> and they get their cutie marks
<Zephirdd> !!!
<ValtheJean> eee....nope
<Zephirdd> :(
<johnsey|workmode> !link maid plot blood
<Barry> The only way that happens is if Sweetie sings
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54735
<johnsey|workmode> there u go
<Zephirdd> thats what I mean
<Barry> and that won't happen any time soon
<ValtheJean> if at all
<Sumica> Zephirdd: compose your thoughts dude =p
<Crainy> thanks
<Zephirdd> :D
<ValtheJean> the CMC lose their relatability once they gain cutie marks
<Barry> She suffers from such a bout of stage fright it overcomes her at just the thought of performing onstage
<thunder-colt> !!!!
<thunder-colt> a mlp celestia commercial just came on!!!

<RobotPinkie> it's a play on National Novel Writing Month
<Barry> Nah. I doubt it
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: National Pony Writing Month Update #2! (http://tinyurl.com/3t4jbx9)
<Sumica> back in a few, need to go start a load of laundry.
<Octavia> i will not make him crack up when he is playing on the classical :)
<Barry> it would just be the last time the CMC were shown onscreen, I think. Once that happens, they'd just get references
<RobotPinkie> I have a deep, dark secret that I'm about to reveal now.
<RobotPinkie> I... love ponies.
<ValtheJean> get out
<ValtheJean> no ponies allowed here
<Barry> That's not a deep, dark secret
<Zephirdd> National obviously
<RobotPinkie> :(
<Zephirdd> as in, The Equestria Nation
<Zephirdd> duh
<Iks> and one viewer less... g2g hit the shower
<LvS> bye
<Barry> A deep, dark secret is something like, say, having an embarrassing arrest record, or something
<Zephirdd> I was arrested for graffitting ponies
<Zephirdd> am i doin it rite?
<RobotPinkie> Oh, well nothing like that's really happened to me.
<Barry> Arrested for graffiti.
<Barry> Not that I was, mind
<Barry> Mine's much worse
*VampirePrincess pokes Aristeo and cat and kitten and jason
<RobotPinkie> My brother has been arrested plenty of times, since he's a bit of a retard...
<Zephirdd> :O
<Aristeo> rawr
<Pinkie_Pie> Zephiridd: STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<RobotPinkie> I guess I'm the white sheep of the family :(
<Barry> isn't it black sheep?
<Octavia> oh holy guacamole commercial
<Zephirdd> lol
<Barry> If you were the only one not arrested in a family of convicts...
<Octavia> i think i just jumped ten feet out of bed
<RobotPinkie> lol if I actually did bad things, it would be black sheep
<Zephirdd> what
<Zephirdd> why?
<Barry> Ok, so your brother is the black sheep
<gingerale> The new spoiler pic explained http://i.imgur.com/w9dAu.jpg
<Zephirdd> why cant white sheeps do bad things
<Zephirdd> why black sheeps always do bad things?!
<Zephirdd> zomg racism
<Zephirdd> lololo
<RobotPinkie> lol indeed
<ValtheJean> it's because they're different :P
<Barry> being a black sheep just means you're different from the others in a group
<ValtheJean> and we must hate different things :P
<VampirePrincess> ari guess what?
<Barry> And you're sometimes treated differently
*VampirePrincess pokes Aristeo again
<Zephirdd> You're different, just like everypony else.
<Zephirdd> duh
<Zephirdd> :d
<Aristeo> It's my birthday? :o
<RobotPinkie> well i guess i am the most deviant of the family, in some ways
<Aristeo> :D
<Barry> Like for example, in FiM, the mane 6 each had a talent, but only Twilight was afraid of showing off. Until Boast Busters, she was the black sheep of the group[
<VampirePrincess> ari cookie's here... ummm cookie hit /nick cookie and fix ur name.
<Aristeo> :o
<Zephirdd> no, she was the purple pony you silly
<Mongoose> Hey
<HaysforPonies> One more class to g.
<Zephirdd> haven't you seen the show?
<Zephirdd> :)
<HaysforPonies> go*
<Charlie_Horse> Excellence.
<Barry> and I mean timeline, not episode, and it's an expression
<Octavia> fantastic
<LvS> i loved that
<VampirePrincess> cookie??? hello?? lol
<Barry> Look, if you were new in a group, and your friends were criticizing someone else for a talent you also had, wouldn't you be afraid of showing that talent?
<LvS> oh, can you play Johnny I hardly knew ye?
<Kodiak> Hey everypony
<Octavia> i have no requests, honestly. i am just enjoying
*VampirePrincess is confused
<Aristeo> :o
<Zephirdd> i'd actually criticize everypony for criticizing the guy for doing what I can do
<Zephirdd> !
<LvS> ah, that's okay
<RobotPinkie> maybe
<Zephirdd> hi Kodiak
<RobotPinkie> ohay Kodiak
<Kodiak> ;)
<VampirePrincess> hey ari it is /nick to change a nickname aint it?
<Barry> Well, in this case, not only was Twilight afraid of losing her friends for showing off, she was also afraid of defending Trixie for the same reason
<Kodiak> What are you ponies talking about with the mane six?
<Octavia> i know terminus
<Octavia> <3
<Aristeo> mhm use /nick to change your nick
<Zephirdd> I'm just trying to make Barry go crazy
<Mongoose> !gnaw
<Zephirdd> :P
<RobotPinkie> I don't think Twilight had any urge to defend Trixie, really...
<Mongoose> I give up
<Kodiak> Ah, that episode.
<Barry> She was only doing her special talent, and the others were criticizing her for it
<Kodiak> I was surprised they didn't keep Trixie
<FallSilently> I'm back, and I'm speaking normally.
<Zephirdd> imo needs more trixie season 2
<Kodiak> She had so much potential as a main character
<Barry> Trixie was a showmare. That's like criticizing a stage magician for the same reason
<ValtheJean> I wasn't. I hated her and wished she'd go away :P
<Kodiak> Zephirdd: *brohoof* Yes
<FallSilently> And things seem to have taken a turn for the romantic.
<Zephirdd> *brohoof*
<RobotPinkie> Trixie wasn't just showing off, she was willing to directly assault people.
<FireLight> any highlight or favorite moment of the season 1 ?
<Barry> Maybe, but she did it on stage
<VampirePrincess> mib_t8xeyo: /nick cookie22
<Zephirdd> well, she only did something for those who came to her first
<Barry> as part of her act
<Zephirdd> and only on stage
<RobotPinkie> It was less about showing off than about making others look bad
<ValtheJean> no, she egged them on
<ValtheJean> and here's the important part
<VampirePrincess> so the confusion ends. lol
<Zephirdd> oh
<Barry> She issued challenges, and the others stepped up to take them
<ValtheJean> she STOPS performing when people start admiring her
<Zephirdd> true true
<ValtheJean> she was doing it for attention
<ValtheJean> if she was a showmare, the show would have continued after the challenge
<LvS> oohh, that was very nice
<Octavia> thank you, Sketchy_Sounds
<LvS> thanks for performing!
<FallSilently> Enjoyed what I heard, good man!
<Barry> True, there are bad eggs in show business
<johnsey|workmode> thanks again, Sketchy
<Barry> but that's the same everywhere
<Sketchy_Sounds> Thanks for tuning in =)
<ValtheJean> yeah, so she was a bad egg
<ValtheJean> and thus deserved the punishment she got
<ValtheJean> and doesn't deserve the rediculous amounts of sympathy she gets
<Barry> She didn't deserve to have an Ursa minor destroying her equipment
<FallSilently> Now I can listen to the Luna thing on the blog page. I'm going to bloody cry.
<ValtheJean> it stopped her from showing off :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Going AFK
<Zephirdd> idk, ever since I read that fic where Trixie is Twilight's younger sis
<RobotPinkie> lol she was pretty much asking for that
<Barry> Probably not
<Zephirdd> I've liked her
<Barry> She probably gets enough money from her acts to afford a whole new set of equipment
<Zephirdd> even though fics have nothing to do with the show
<Zephirdd> .-.
*VampirePrincess pokes mib_t8xeyo
<Octavia> which luna thing
<VampirePrincess> :)
<Octavia> cyrils song is boss
<Barry> as the saying goes, "The show must go on".
<Iks> the vid posted on eqd
<Sketchy_Sounds> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/when-she-loved-me.html#more That one probably
<ValtheJean> assuming she's a showmare in the first place
<Barry> And she only issued the challenges anyway because of the neigh-sayers, as she said
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh gosh, I'm watching it now
<FallSilently> It was posted about half an hour ago. It's Jessie's song from Toy Story 2. One of the epicest
<User_2255> Quick question if I might my good ponies, does anypony know where I could get a hoodie with the Elements of Harmony on it?
<ValtheJean> and not just an egocentric bitch who feeds off of the stupidity of others
<Sketchy_Sounds> ;~;
<FallSilently> ... epicest Disney songs ever, and really sad.
<Iks> thats a disney song?
*VampirePrincess facepalms
<Barry> If Twilight and the others just enjoyed the show, instead of criticizing it, it would have been a normal routine for her
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's from Toy Story 2
<prince-dari> Trixie sucks.
<VampirePrincess> oui
<Sumica> Twi did't want to show here up cause they are systems =p
<Sketchy_Sounds> Jessie's song
<Iks> i dont remember
<User_2255> 'dat video. It reminds us what tears feel like.
<VampirePrincess> cookie?
<ValtheJean> what is this madness? Dari agrees with me???? WHAT IS HAPPENING?
<Sumica> sisters even
<Iks> and i think of pixar being seperated from disney
<Aristeo> mew
<Barry> Sometimes the episodes have broken aesops
<Octavia> holy mole.
<Octavia> this.. sad
<Charlie_Horse> Eeyup.
<RobotPinkie> I don't really mind Trixie, but Barry is really making me not want to like her right now...
<Octavia> noooo
*Octavia wipes her eyes
<Charlie_Horse> Not the saddest I've heard, but...top 10, definitely.
<Sumica> Wait you hate her cause some one else likes her?
*Sketchy_Sounds barely avoids crying
<Barry> I'm only saying that she issued the challenges because twi and the others criticized her
<VampirePrincess> mib_8kz65f: look over here too.
<Octavia> well, now i have a new song to learn
<ValtheJean> Twi never said anything bad :P
<RobotPinkie> That's pretty much the opposite of what I said, Sumica
<LvS> oh dear. and i break so easily...
<Charlie_Horse> Hmm, Top 5, even.
<Barry> True as that may be, she didn't stop the others, either
<Barry> so she's guilty by association
<RobotPinkie> Complete and utter nonsense.
<Sumica> Ah yes clearly i am blind
*VampirePrincess pokes ari
<ValtheJean> so suddenly inaction means guilt? that's a justice system I would love *sarcasm*
<VampirePrincess> this is ur fault ari. the sites all complicated and stuff.
<Barry> Sometimes it's worse to say nothing, than to try to stop others
<Sumica> Some states have that law ValtheJean
<Barry> say and do*
<Luna> 07Stream's up
<Sumica> Good sameratin laws
<ValtheJean> lol Sumica, then those states deserve to burn :P
<RobotPinkie> She didn't show them up at their own game, she physically attacked them, Barry.
<ValtheJean> Twi was having a crisis of identity, and so now she's culpable for something that happened?
<Sumica> But it's more of If you watch a crime happen and dont do any thing about it.
<ValtheJean> that's idiotic
<Pontang> ValtheJean: watch the final two episodes of Seinfeld. ;p
<Sumica> watching some one die and not calling for help and so on.
<ValtheJean> so I could be arrested for not charging a man with a gun?
<Barry> You could be
<ValtheJean> only in America...good grief...
<FireLight> Sketchy you make my little sister cry
<Pontang> good samaritan laws
<Ziltoid> hey brownies
<Sumica> You could be charged with a crime for not reporting a crime.
<RobotPinkie> hey Ziltoid
<Barry> Actually, you could be arrested for not calling the police on that guy
<FallSilently> He's not that terrifying, is he?
<Sumica> You dont have to try and stop it just report it happend.
<Barry> and I was ninja'd
<ValtheJean> okay, see now we're getting to a completely different subject
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pfffft XD
<WhatPayne> Sweet streams
<ValtheJean> because Twi wasn't witnessing the other 5 gang banging trixie
*Octavia likes this one
<Sketchy_Sounds> Pretty sure he means becuase of the link ;p
<Octavia> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo2448-AhFI&feature=player_embedded
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Millennium Alone (Luna Fan Song)
<RobotPinkie> >rolling your eyes at a braggart is apparently now the same as an actual crime
<Ziltoid> wut
<FireLight> yes was for that :P
<Barry> but she did witness and do nothing when Trixie used her magic to assault her friends. Some friend she is
<RobotPinkie> >not stopping your friend from rolling her eyes = guilt by association
<Ziltoid> You guys stream house yet?
<Barry> I admit she's still learning the ins and outs of friendship
<Sumica> Varying levels of guilt. But Guilt non the less.
<FallSilently> Weren't the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards sealed away for a millennium, too? How come there's no music about them?
<Ziltoid> omg courage
<RobotPinkie> nope, House hasn't been yt
<ValtheJean> Courage is the only dog I would ever want to have as a pet
<Octavia> because they werent cute and adorable?
<Cat> Hello VampirePrincess
<Luna> 07House will start after Courage
<Ziltoid> Courage will save your ass no matter what
<RobotPinkie> and yay, thx Luna!
<Cat> :o
<VampirePrincess> hihi cat

<Barry> Will you try to put episodes 27-52 on there, if you can, when they're released?
*VampirePrincess pokes cookie22

<Octavia> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6UXT7mk_Xo
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.

*Aristeo takes Jason then
<Aristeo> Jason?
<Sumica> Ah the computer
<VampirePrincess> lol jason's my brother sooooooo
<FallSilently> It linked me to an MGMT song.
<Iks> meh its a cover and still blocked in germany
<johnsey|workmode> "Unfortunately, this SME-music-content is not available in Germany because GEMA has not granted the respective music publishing rights. "
<Iks> copy the URL and put it into hidemyass.com
<Octavia> huh, it is a pure cover, too
<Iks> fascism doesnt care
<johnsey|workmode> i assume youtube is doing the matching automatically
<johnsey|workmode> so the cover was probably close enough to the original to be recognized
*VampirePrincess pokes cookie22 "talk, silly, or they'll think i'm dtaing a mute. lol"
<ValtheJean> poor poor doogie
<Iks> i once uploaded a 15 sec clip of seaquest to youtube... was blocked in 5 minutes
<Cat> I like screwing up people's badly asked questions: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9897526/kittens.JPG
<Octavia> you can tell it is a karaoke track with vocals over top
<Ziltoid> AHHHHHHH
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: The Equestrian Inquirer Issue #3 (http://tinyurl.com/3egzvl4)

<Ziltoid> so much screaming
<VampirePrincess> hmm, typo. oh well. cat thts not nice.
<Sumica> what no spring back and hit himself on the bed?
<Sumica> I am disappointed.
<VampirePrincess> dang...

<FallSilently> Well I'm gonna go find summat to devour. Shall be back eventually to harass and annoy as per normal.
<VampirePrincess> lololol
<Ziltoid> Stupid dog.
<Kodiak> Pinkie_Pie: That's the best idea I've ever heard lol
<VampirePrincess> there he is.
<Kodiak> I'm only using like 12GB of the 320GB I have
<Ziltoid> >doctor in the house
<WhatPayne> that was...
<Cat> hello!
<Ziltoid> foreshadowing
*VampirePrincess hugs cookie22

<Kodiak> Ha! There's Tom!
<ValtheJean> but he was like...the announcer for some CN program
<ValtheJean> his name was Tom? Huh
<RobotPinkie> yeah, Toonami
<ValtheJean> moosic
<RobotPinkie> weird, so FiM isn't going to air on CN here as was originally said

<VampirePrincess> omg.
<Sumica> Where is here RobotPinkie?
<RobotPinkie> Sweden
<Cat> two cookies? I think I'm in heaven
<VampirePrincess> gr.

<VampirePrincess> the site keeps throwing him off. not sure why.
<Cat> can we have five next?
<Sumica> They are a part of CN
<VampirePrincess> lolol
<ValtheJean> so I'm guessing I missed the beginning of the latest House season, huh?
<VampirePrincess> he's all mine.
<ValtheJean> anything interesting happen with the guy who shot him?
*VampirePrincess is very greedy with her cookie
<Cat> I want a toaster that also makes fried eggs
<VampirePrincess> invent it. :D
<Sumica> those eyes
<Cat> it probably already exists
<Ziltoid> I think he died?
<Ziltoid> I dint catch the beggining either
<RobotPinkie> "most of he overseas stuff"?
<Sumica> Yeah as in not in the US.
<VampirePrincess> i've nvr heard of one.
<RobotPinkie> Ah, you mean specifically for FiM, I guess
<Sumica> Yeah
<Ziltoid> oh
<Ziltoid> oh dear
<RobotPinkie> normally Boomerang airs only retro shows, here, so that's kinda weird
<Ziltoid> inb4 he dies
<Charlie_Horse> Strangely quiet in here.

<Kodiak> What's Luna streaming?
<ValtheJean> that would be House
<Ziltoid> indeed
<Pinkie_Pie> >yfw I already moved one episode to my ps3 on a huge screen, and the quality looks better than on my computer
<FreezeFrame> (Darryl is my real name, and what I use on a different server)
<Sumica> Yeah Boomerang dose the same here RobotPinkie but for what I have seen other areas have MLP on boomerang.
<Kodiak> Ah
<RobotPinkie> House, season 3 episode.... 8?
<johnsey|workmode> just like here in the office
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie: What was that?
<Kodiak> Never seen it before

<Cesco> I'm up to 52% success!

<Pinkie_Pie> Never seen a video get better quality on a much larger screen
<ValtheJean> even if you end up not liking it, it's a movie that you should probably see once
<Jason> :3 sucks
<Jason> whats ew in yer life?
<RobotPinkie> I'd recommed it, WhatPayne, though I'd also recommend going through the wikipedia entry AFTER watching the movie.
<Jason> lol, sorry if I dont respond to your message, but I am using my backup compie, and the proc sucks

<VampirePrincess> it kept throwing him off. not his fault.
<prince-dari> WHY SO SERIOUS?!
<Ziltoid> oh hay dari
<RobotPinkie> i have the 720p vids without watermarks.. really hoping for blu ray set :(
<Jason> mibbit sucks
<VampirePrincess> hey it works for me.
<InsertCupcake> i would be all over a blu-ray set
<WhatPayne> ^same ones
<Jason> I would just run PJIRC on a webserver on your local machin
<Jason> mchine
<Sumica> yeah same here.
<Jason> of couse, if you could do that, you might aswell download an irc client
<Jason> but PJIRC is a lot better
<Jason> than mibbit, that is
<VampirePrincess> what cud i recommend to cookie?
<WhatPayne> I'd pay moneys for Season 1 Blu-Ray boxset.
<Pinkie_Pie> Watermarks?
<VampirePrincess> like send me a link to refer him to.
<ValtheJean> lol, every brony would :P
<Pinkie_Pie> The colours are lighter
<Ziltoid> exept not
<WhatPayne> no box-set
<Sumica> watermarks would be like the Hub logo.
<Ziltoid> OH SHI-
<Sumica> blasting from all holes
<WhatPayne> ew
<Jason> hmmm
<InsertCupcake> Have i missed a lupus mention in this ep?
<WhatPayne> I don't think so...
<Sumica> You just made it.
<InsertCupcake> oh good
<Jason> VampirePrincess: http://02.chat.mibbit.com/#epic-chat@irc.epic-chat.net
<Colson> Hi!
<Colgate> hihello
<Pinkie_Pie> Erm.. Havent noticed.. I dont think so
<Pinkie_Pie> One sec, lemme check
<johnsey|workmode> chello
<Sumica> oh look housebeing raceist again.
<Ziltoid> never lupus
<VampirePrincess> thts mibbit. lol.
<Jason> Aristeo: You didnt get my texts?
<RobotPinkie> that is so racist
<Jason> yeah, but its a direct link to the online client
<Colgate> c hello? printf("hello");
<Pinkie_Pie> No, no watermarks
<Jason> Cat: Where is Cat1 ?
<Jason> I miss Cat1
<johnsey|workmode> what, no line break? :G
<ValtheJean> lol, you can get the itunes versions if you're happy with missing layers :P
<RobotPinkie> I like watermelons
<RobotPinkie> ...missing layers?
<ValtheJean> yeah
<Colson> that is easier in python
<Colson> :D
<ValtheJean> there are particular shots where certain characters are missing and whatnot
<ValtheJean> very nit-picky mind you
<ValtheJean> but there are inconsistencies
<Colgate> nah, you can see it all the words run into each other on one giant line!
<Sumica> The itunes ones have a slightly faided color commpared to the hub versions
<WhatPayne> wait what layers?
<Cat> iunno
<Cat> probably dead
<ValtheJean> take, for example, the fear song
<ValtheJean> the shot where everyone is laughing
<Pinkie_Pie> The version I have is more than just slightly faded colors
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<Lilfut> SO HOW ABOUT THAT DVD HUH
<ValtheJean> fluttershy and rainbowdash are missing
<Colgate> I could never get into python, the white space thing just irked me
<WhatPayne> How do I know what version I have?
<ValtheJean> iunno
<Colson> White space thing?
<Lilfut> SO HOW ABOUT THAT DVD HUH
<Colson> like, indentations?
<Lilfut> i really hope it has some good special features
<Colgate> where you have to have specific amounts of white space
<Jason> D:
<VampirePrincess> o.o
<Colson> ah
<WhatPayne> You said something about missing layers? Any specific examples?
<RobotPinkie> it would help to see a comparison shot or something
<Colson> Wait, what language was that snippet you just posted in?
<herospirit> *walks into bronystate just in time for butt stab*
<ValtheJean> see the fear song example
<Jason> [lo:ng:ti:me:ago] *Cat1 dies
<Jason> :3
<herospirit> Hey guys, I see it's life as usual
<RobotPinkie> lol butt stab?
<Colgate> well, many languages, but I was implying C
<prince-dari> Lawl
<ValtheJean> it was a thread on ponychan, but I'm sure it's 404'd by now
<Ziltoid> butt stab must always be seem
<RobotPinkie> ah okay
<prince-dari> Dash is missing?
<RobotPinkie> so it's better to have the watermarked versions, if you care about stuff like that?
*Jason ponders about wondering why his 2 irc servers keep splitting
<prince-dari> Fuck the itunes version.
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<ValtheJean> lol
*prince-dari deletes
<Nuclear> OMG ARM NEON SIMD instructions Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
<KnightLight> Hey, Everypony!
<RobotPinkie> lol i see her fine in my 720p version...
<Fluttershy> Hm? I'm here. I'm drawing. o-o
<Lawdee> Why are your names so similar
<Fluttershy> And watching House.
<RobotPinkie> OW
<Nuclear> Heya!
<herospirit> That little girl is the most mature person on this show :0
<lawdey> :p
<Nuclear> I must learn how to program this delicate piece of silicon.....
<Ziltoid> lawl
*prince-dari restores from recyle bin
<prince-dari> Ok.
<herospirit> He has everything
<prince-dari> If Dash is still there it's all good.
<herospirit> The kid has EVERYTHING.
<Lawdee> Silicon...?
<InsertCupcake> GET ALL THE DISEASES!
<Pinkie_Pie> Applejack and Rarity isnt in the shot where they all fall down laughing
<WhatPayne> Oh damnit... I have Itunes versions.
<prince-dari> LUPUS!
<Pinkie_Pie> In my version
<Nuclear> Well it is silicon
<Sumica> I am gonna have to check that ValtheJean
<Lawdee> Program...?
<Nuclear> Silicon with logic gates.....
<Pinkie_Pie> Hi Herospirit
<ValtheJean> meh, then maybe I remember the specifics wrong
<herospirit> Why in the world is the Itunes version different than the normal one?
<ValtheJean> but there are still missing characters
<herospirit> OHAI PINKIE.
*VampirePrincess breaks silence with a radio.
<Lawdee> Okay
<Jason> :O
<WhatPayne> http://i.imgur.com/mNI4B.jpg
<herospirit> But why, Payne, why
<ValtheJean> oooohhh
<ValtheJean> it was THAT shot
<KnightLight> So what's up? I'm not always able to visit Equestria Daily as often as I'd like, so what's been going on recently?
<ValtheJean> thanks whatpayne
<InsertCupcake> why are they missing?
<ValtheJean> missing layers
<ValtheJean> the joys of using flash
<WhatPayne> I always wondered why that shot had RD and Fluttershy missing...
<ValtheJean> most of the animation errors in FiM is related to flash being retarded
<prince-dari> Dash IS missing.
*prince-dari deletes again
<herospirit> Mmmm
<InsertCupcake> lol
<Lawdee> Wellll...
<Lawdee> Ponies have been going on, talky
<KnightLight> uh oh...did I just opena canof worms?
<ValtheJean> though as to why the itunes version has more inconsistencies, I have no idea
<Lawdee> Really*
<Ziltoid> lol
<Colson> untz untz untz
<Lawdee> Damn you swype
<ValtheJean> maybe it's because they sent them the wrong base files? I dunno
<herospirit> Dash is missing in one shot? Dari deletes it
<Lilfut> so, how about that dvd
<WhatPayne> Now the question is: Where can I find best quality versions?
<herospirit> :p
<RobotPinkie> weird
<ValtheJean> either way, it's still a rip-off to pay for episodes on itunes
<Sumica> Guess mine is't the itunes version then, cause i see all but Rarity and AJ.
<RobotPinkie> yah that shot is definitely with missing layers in the 720p version I have
<Fluttershy> I have Winter Wrap Up stuck in my head... ^w^;
<RobotPinkie> guess I'm downloading the version with crappy hub logos and stuf, then :(
<Sumica> asuming I am looking at the right snot.
<ValtheJean> I'm holding off downloading the episodes because I still cling to the dying belief that they will release dvds
<herospirit> *giggle* the right snot.
<JackiePie> Hi
<Cat> uh oh, explosion! aaagh
<RobotPinkie> dvds... :(
<JackiePie> My internet dropped earlier. :(
<ValtheJean> or blu rays
<herospirit> :[
<ValtheJean> I don't care
<ValtheJean> I just want them on some sort of cd
<RobotPinkie> i care!
<VampirePrincess> ??
<KnightLight> Then welcome back, JackiePie
<RobotPinkie> lol
<JackiePie> Thanks
<Fluttershy> "Winter wrap up, winter wrap uuuuppp..." =_=;
<herospirit> Val would buy a bluray player just for Ponies.
<Ziltoid> its nah a tumor
*Fluttershy sits in the corner, blinks.
<ValtheJean> I have a ps3 so that's settled for me. BUT, I would if I didn't :P
<Sumica> LUPIS EVERYWHERE
<Pinkie_Pie> Herospirit, I have the same version as Dari, I intend to delete..
<FreezeFrame> Lupus*
<WhatPayne> Someone somewhere has proper versions.... Has to be
<Colson> anypony here with a PS3 and Borderlands?
<RobotPinkie> i'd buy a real pony if i got a blu ray of FiM season 1 with it...
<Jason> :OO
<herospirit> That doesn't mean I can't give Dari a hard time for doing a reasonable thing :P
*Jason lights Cat on fire
<ValtheJean> I'd buy ANYTHING if it came with a FiM season 1 blu ray with commentaries :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Hasbros new marketing department.. Real ponies
<Fluttershy> Proper versions of MLP? I downloaded the 720p versions without any watermarks. They're nice.
<Pinkie_Pie> Lol
<RobotPinkie> suddenly stream cut off for me
<Sumica> They are nice but color is faided Fluttershy
<Fluttershy> The colors look fine to me.
<Fluttershy> o-o
*VampirePrincess pokes Jason and cat :D
*VampirePrincess burns her hand on cat.
<VampirePrincess> ow
<FreezeFrame> "Rainbow Dash was the first to volunteer for any attempt to give a Pegasus a magical horn. This has been universally declared a bad idea."
<RobotPinkie> seems to work fine now lol
*Jason nibbles on Cat
<herospirit> Habro is spray-painting horses as we speak
<Fluttershy> Hmmm... I torrented mine though. =w=;
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince-Dari, suddenly I worry that Dash is missing in other shots
<Pinkie_Pie> D=
<VampirePrincess> u lit him on fire how u nibbling him?
<Pinkie_Pie> Where can I download the version with dash in the highest possible quality?
<RobotPinkie> i'm definitely never watching the 720p versions again... because i'm quite gay for not having missing stuff.... :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Filesize is not an issue..
<Sumica> Look at an ep side by side with a youtube version Fluttershy
<Jason> it adds extra flavor
<Ionnan> hey everypony! Just wastin some time before class. What's up?
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie: Same here, I'm just furious
<VampirePrincess> lol wow
<Colgate> nothing
<Colson> stuff~
<ValtheJean> lol, I should never have mentioned it >.<
<Ionnan> wait... both nothing and stuff?
<RobotPinkie> haha, no it's good, ValtheJean
<JackiePie> lol
<KershaFangs> Homeowrk and a headache.
<WhatPayne> ValtheJean: Thanks for this, really I had no idea
<KershaFangs> I don't want to admit to being sick or else I may really become sick.
<Fluttershy> @Sumica I'll do that but it's still not a big issue to me if the colors are somewhat faded o-o
<JackiePie> Not if you admit it, and take care of it before it gets bad
<JackiePie> Unless it's a virus, then there's really nothing you can do.
<RobotPinkie> it's not like anyone lost anything from knowing that :P
<RobotPinkie> ...except for their innocence, of course
<WhatPayne> It's not the colours, but now I can't be sure if there is actual missing content.
<Sumica> to tell you the truth I have never noticed any thing missing.
<ValtheJean> well, Dari lost a bit of stuff due to a somewhat unrelated deletion :P
<Ionnan> Fight the sickness!
<RobotPinkie> lol
<KershaFangs> I have a strong immune system. Most sicknesses I feel and it wears me down but it doesn't make me bedridden.
<ValtheJean> you wont be missing anything SIGNIFICANT
<ValtheJean> just background layers and such
<ValtheJean> so for example, some missing ponies
*Cat goes for a lie down
<ValtheJean> none of which are the main focus of the shot
<SummerRain> :3
<Pinkie_Pie> BUT RAINBOW DASH IS MISSING IN ONE SHOT
<Pinkie_Pie> IT CANNOT BE TOLERATED
<Ionnan> Don't have sugar... even if it is sweet and yummy
<herospirit> SUDDENLY PONIES
<ValtheJean> I SAW CARAMEL DANSEN
*Iks is playing: 692. Down With The Sickness  Disturbed  The Sickness  4  4:38 - 128kbps
<ValtheJean> I DEMAND IT BE PLAYED
<Iks> wtf 128 kbps?
<Vinnyboiler> God I wish it's the 17th already!
<RobotPinkie> I know, but I'm not really that bothered by hub logos
<Ionnan> lol don't with the sickness
<Ionnan> oh yes! me too!
*VampirePrincess pets cat
<Ionnan> I'm super psyched!
<SummerRain> hewwo.
<JackiePie> !s2
<VampirePrincess> :)
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 9d:16h:14m:54s
<KershaFangs> I'm eating fruits.
<JackiePie> Which ones?
<InsertCupcake> ill put up with logos and such till the retail release i think
<Sumica> dose kinda make me want to look for a side by side of the altered shots.
<Vinnyboiler> I ultra psyched
<JackiePie> inb4 bannana
<Ionnan> I wonder if it'll be available immediately online...
<Colgate> 128 kbps ftw, that is horrible
<Colgate> ftl8
<Ionnan> I don't have cable.. :(
<SummerRain> DJ-PON3
<SummerRain> coolio
<Cat> aren't I still on fire?
<DJ-PON3> What?
<SummerRain> Ionnan: look them up when they comr up on youtube
<VampirePrincess> ...
<Fluttershy> Hmm slightly faded possibly but the colors are still very bright
<SummerRain> I am a big fan :D
<Pinkie_Pie> I want to know where I can download the non itunes version, preferably all 26 episodes in one folder
<SummerRain> @DJ
<DJ-PON3> Aww, thanks.
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<Sumica> suddly mouse flys acorsss the screen
<SummerRain> :3
<Iks> well i got those files like.... 10 years ago or so
<KershaFangs> Mamoncillo. It's a tropical fruit.
<ValtheJean> I believe there's a stickied thread on ponychan
*VampirePrincess puts u out first the gives u tea then pets u
<Pinkie_Pie> Im serious about re downloading.. I have to have my ponies in perfect condition
<VampirePrincess> :P
<ValtheJean> specifically /pony/
<Ionnan> oh! gtg guys! have fun
<Pinkie_Pie> I have no idea how to find a thread on there
<Pinkie_Pie> I have never used a chan site before
<Pinkie_Pie> Link pl0x
<ValtheJean> I'll grab it for you
<Fluttershy> Pinkie_Pie: I torrented all 26 eps o-o it took 'em a while to download but it was worth it
<Pinkie_Pie> The one I downloaded was 19gb
<Sumica> I just went to Pirate bay for mine.
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<ShadTheCrazed> Anyone wanna do the Carlton to Robots_FTW with me when S2 comes out?
<Fluttershy> Pirate Bay here too =w=;
<Pinkie_Pie> Same
<SummerRain> was gonna follow in your footsteps.. DJ-PON3. but.. it's not the life for me unfortunately. But, the DJ life seems quite interesting and fun.
<RobotPinkie> i just went to google for mine...
<Fluttershy> Yes, it's the truth... I, Fluttershy... torrented. -hangs her head-
<JackiePie> Kersha they look like grapes. I searched them on Wikipedia.
<DJ-PON3> Ok?..
<Iks> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Iks!
<WhatPayne> But it's not that easy to know which ones are itunes and which ones are tv rips
<^Stargazer> hihi everypony
<ValtheJean> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35803447.html
<ShadTheCrazed> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x_tx5K5wgU
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<Pinkie_Pie> Thanks Arch Demon
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about EVERYONE&#39;S REACTION TO THE PORTAL 2 COUNTDOWN
<KershaFangs> It has a hard shell though, like a lychee. The flavor ranges between bitterly sour to tangy and sweet.
<Sumica> Farly sure the Itunes one are the ones without water marks
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Hey again.
<SummerRain> Hey Stargazer.
<ShadTheCrazed> Replace that to "SEAON 2 COUNTDOWN"
<RobotPinkie> iTunes ones are only 720p, right?
<ShadTheCrazed> SO LET'S ALL DO THE CARLTON WHEN SEASON 2 COMES OUT K? :D
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Oh, you changed the topic I see.
<ShadTheCrazed> *season
<SummerRain> Shad :3
<Sumica> no clue
<SummerRain> hey
<RobotPinkie> so a good way to get he right version, just search for 1080p, i'd guess...
<Shamrock> Have I missed anything in here?
<Shamrock> After Dark gets lonely.
<SummerRain> .. >_>
<SummerRain> lol
<Fluttershy> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
<InsertCupcake> I downloaded mine from youtube

<Colgate> how does afterdark get awesome?
<SummerRain> yes
<Fluttershy> :C
<ShadTheCrazed> So yeah, I'll be (possibly recording myself) doing the Carlton around hte time season 2 comes out (and upload it to youtube)
*RobotPinkie hugs Fluttershy instead
<SummerRain> if its appropriate
<ShadTheCrazed> *the
*Fluttershy is hugged, squeaks. o_o
<Ziltoid> and awesome holidays
<Colgate> when the convo isn't about 18+ stuff -.-
<SummerRain> yeah..
<ShadTheCrazed> I could change the conversation to something that isn't 18+ if I was allowed there. *forever alone*
<AllisZero> Oh man, I'm so sick
<Sumica> So who all is singing the son in there head right now thanks to dari?
<SummerRain> yeah
*ShadTheCrazed is 13, not 18

<SummerRain> *either
<prince-dari> eh nod fod
<GGgala> eeyup
<DeniedExistenceMobile> :)
<Pinkie_Pie> What is the chance of a Blu-Ray sometime in the near future..?
<^Stargazer> I'm gonna go "you rock, woohoo" and "yay" when season 2 comes out lol
<RobotPinkie> I thnk we have a traitor in our midst!
<ValtheJean> HELL YES
*ValtheJean dances
<^Stargazer> maybe some "oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh" as well lol
<RobotPinkie> I think a DVD set is VERY likely sometime soon
<SummerRain> lawlsss
<GGgala> now that i could, thanks to the return of dari and his ChanServ buddy
<Fluttershy> O:
<Pinkie_Pie> DVD isnt good enough. Blu-Ray
<Sumica> if they are smart there will be a set.
<RobotPinkie> Blu Ray set, realistically, I'd say is pretty low...
<ShadTheCrazed> I'll be doing the Carlton.
<SummerRain> :p
<PrincePolo> oh man not this one
<Pinkie_Pie> Wouldnt there be a large quality loss if it was on DVD?
<ShadTheCrazed> I just need a fitting pony-related song.
<JackiePie> Hi
<Fluttershy> So much Pinkie... o-o
<RobotPinkie> They are smart, which is why there will be a DVD set :P
<DecapKing> what is this?
<RobotPinkie> not sure there's enough money in a Blu Ray set for them to care
<SummerRain> well i guess im gonna head off
<RobotPinkie> this is Caramelldansen, DecapKing
<SummerRain> not a lot of activity
<herospirit> I can't get this stuck in my head right now. Because this is stuck in my head. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qp_nMntvR8
<Sumica> in fact if they were realy smart there would be a ad for it on the 17th at around 615am pst.
<SummerRain> and i got a story to write
<SummerRain> hold on
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Lost connection for a second.
<WhatPayne> Rumour has it that DVD's have already surfaced here and there...
<SummerRain> lemme check Equestria study
<ValtheJean> they released shit dvds with only 2 episodes on them
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Best RP here ever so far.
<FreezeFrame> herospirit: SOOO AWESOME
<ValtheJean> in other words, pissed every brony off
<Sumica> the dvd's paired with toys
<Boombox> ...? ...*
<RobotPinkie> Eeeeyup, for the kiddies
<herospirit> I know right, Doctor Freeze?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Hi Boombox. Just talking about last night.
<RobotPinkie> they'll do a pretty good DVD set, I'd bet...
<AllisZero> In this episode, House treats the clown in the park for botulism
<herospirit> The father is going to get hurt because we expect the kid to.
<Boombox> ... ... ...*
<DeniedExistenceMobile> How's the trixie fix coming?
<Vinnyboiler> Talking about Pony related songs
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Fic*
<herospirit> Damn, I lose
<Boombox> ... ...*

<DeniedExistenceMobile> Glad to hear that.
<RobotPinkie> you scream, you ruse
<herospirit> Dari I'm blaming you for my failure
<prince-dari> :(
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Hey DecapKing
<herospirit> Because you are the master troll.
*Boombox runs out of the room beeping really fast about something
<herospirit> THE MASTER
<RobotPinkie> blu ray probably isn't happening
<Vinnyboiler> I need a pony MIDI file, so I can have music in my Pony related SM64 stage
<prince-dari> I'll just go hang myself then.
<prince-dari> Clearly no one likes me.
<Sumica> get now Pinkie_Pie then buy dvd when/if.
<prince-dari> :'(
*DeniedExistenceMobile shrugs.
<FreezeFrame> Okay, time to go get dinner
<DecapKing> hey DE
<FreezeFrame> And take my Stats homework with me so I do it.
*Luna likes prince-dari
<WhatPayne> Apparently there are proper 720p proper versions w/o watermarks
<herospirit> Dari, I obviously highly respect your trolling abilities.

<RobotPinkie> I'll buy the blu ray if they release it
<Sumica> proper as in?
<Vinnyboiler> Does anyone know if anyone made any MIDI files on any of the music featured on the show?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Tell the truth: Did you jack off during or after Emerald's fun?
<Sumica> SNIPER!
<WhatPayne> as in all layers...
<Fluttershy> @Luna I put my livestream up again... o-o
<RobotPinkie> even if it's a region A locked bullshit release
<Pinkie_Pie> I already have all 26 episodes in HD MKV h.264x
<prince-dari> So THAT'S why they didn't have a laser pointer before.
<WhatPayne> ... no missing Dash
<Pinkie_Pie> But it seems to be missing some shots
<Luna> 07wll put you on after this ep :)
<Fluttershy> well, for later xP
<Pinkie_Pie> So, should I redownload..
<DecapKing> i dont need to jack off, i have a slutty girlfriend for that

<DeniedExistenceMobile> Yeah....SURE

<prince-dari> So we have plaques around the school for students who've been to the school then gone on to be in high up/important jobs.
<prince-dari> One of the plaques.
<prince-dari> The job.
<^Stargazer> I wonder who that comic is staring
<prince-dari> Can you guess what it was?
<Sumica> i want to side by side them now.
<^Stargazer> >_> lol
<Sumica> Did it say 4knocks?
<Ziltoid> Doctor
<SummerRain> is that a gory one
<SummerRain> or a cute one
<Fluttershy> http://www.cracked.com/blog/write-your-own-house-episode/
<Dashite> My school only had plaques to show the names of all the people from the school that died in WWI and WWII
<prince-dari> ^ Oh, we have that too
<^Stargazer> it's... kind of creppy and cute at the same time
<DerpyBot> guacamole
<Fluttershy> No, you should just remove them at will
<prince-dari> No one even going to guess what job the guy had? :P
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Well *Crosses arms* I know I did.
<GGgala> and come on. you never jack off, ever? really Decap?
<SummerRain> ..
<SummerRain> >_>
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Smug look*
<SummerRain> how so
<Sumica> my school had shots for the filming of back to the future on the wall.s
<GGgala> heh. During or after, Denied?
<DecapKing> i didnt say i never jack off, i just dont do it as much
<^Stargazer> 8
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Did you though?
<^Stargazer> *creapy
<^Stargazer> o.o @ second comic
<DecapKing> no
<JackiePie> It's not creepy, as much as it's a cute misunderstanding of how babies are born.
<RobotPinkie> I would literally stab this guy in the eye with a frozen squirrel.
<johnsey|workmode> ow was babby formed
<DeniedExistenceMobile> During obviously. I didn't really have anything better to do...
<johnsey|workmode> *how
<InsertCupcake> I would stab a squirrel with a frozen this guy
<prince-dari> Well.
<prince-dari> Anyway.
<JackiePie> Derpy thought that babies came out of the oven.
<prince-dari> The job was the Queen's gynaecologist.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> xD
<Dashite> O.o
<Sumica> So what was it Dari?
<InsertCupcake> 0.o
<GGgala> lawl, true. and you were in bed anyway iirc.
<JackiePie> Probably because when parents talk about babies, they'll say "Yeah one's in the oven"
<^Stargazer> momma always told me Storks carried babies to famillies!
<GGgala> XD
<Ziltoid> LOLWUT
<Sumica> lol
<RobotPinkie> lol wow
<prince-dari> And he went to my school.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Brb, getting glasses fit.
<HaysforPonies> Anyone have the screencap of Lauren Faust saying on DA that they have kids the natural way? With a reply something of "LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE?!"
<GGgala> ohai <3
<prince-dari> We've had some pretty important people come from my school.
<DecapKing> just imagine someone seeing this conversation
<prince-dari> A prime minister.
<prince-dari> An Archbishop of Canterbury
<^Stargazer> !link word_of_Faust children
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<^Stargazer> !link word_of_Faust kid
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<^Stargazer> hum
<^Stargazer> maybe I mispelled something
<Dashite> We've had the first, not the second though.
<Dashite> :p
<JackiePie> Maybe you shouldn't use underscores
<Sumica> beats mine again Dari, Richard Nixon and Elvira
<Dashite> So you've had not a crook and...
<Ziltoid> wut
<GGgala> that's hilarious, dari
<RobotPinkie> and Jesus' proctologist
<SummerRain> lawls
<InsertCupcake> pretty much no-one from my high school. at least not that I know of
<prince-dari> Richard Nixon? Hah.
<Sumica> jease mom
<prince-dari> Who's Elvira?
<Pinkie_Pie> I am now depressed over a few little animation errors, what the heck is wrong with me -.-
<InsertCupcake> we all are Pinkie Pie
<^Stargazer> everytime someone wanted a link of faust they used them
<InsertCupcake> although animation errors gave us derpy
<Pinkie_Pie> Thats a relief, but for now I must halt moving MLP to my ps3..
<^Stargazer> !link word_of_Faust

<^Stargazer> c?
<GGgala> dari: i think it's Elvira, Mistress of the Dark - https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cassandra_Peterson
<Pinkie_Pie> But it also ripped Rainbow Dash from us for unacceptable periods of time
<SummerRain|AFC> away from chat :3

<Charlie_Horse> I'm not sure if it's entirely impolite here.
<Turgle> probably
<RobotPinkie> well we have movie night also, GenoGaron
<Charlie_Horse> Where people have a tendency to come and go within seconds.
<RobotPinkie> with SOME pony...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Now I just need to get Dari's opinion.
<Charlie_Horse> If everyone stopped to say "hi" and "bye" to everyone else, there'd be no time for ponies, see...
<DecapKing> hey VioletVanilla
<RobotPinkie> and pony videos, and stuff
<AllisZero> He's not the dad!
<Turgle> pony stuff
<Dashite> Wait, are you saying you would have picked me?

<Barry> ah
<Sketchy_Sounds> My headmeats, they hurt
<FallSilently> Personally, I never say hi when I join, unless someone greets me. I don't want to interrupt the conversation, and wait to see what's being said before saying anything. But that's just me.
<Sumica> well till people get sick of it at least.
<herospirit> Chase needs to drown his rage in peanut butter

<Turgle> DING<>!

<Turgle> WHAT THE HELL
<Sockwear_Moon> Now how'd that even happen. It looked fine to me.
<Barry> Hi, Fluttershy
<prince-dari> What are we watching a stream of?
<AllisZero> Haro
<Dashite> The stream.
<Silvermane> i'm tripping out man
<Turgle> I SEE MY MESSAGES!
<Dashite> It's a stream of the stream.
<Barry> We're watching a stream of the stream
<Dashite> Of the stream.
<DecapKing> a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a strem
<Dashite> of the stream.
<Sumica> We are watching Fluttershy streaming through Lun's stream
<RobotPinkie> We are looking into the abyss, prince-dari
<Barry> ninja'd again!
<bicyclerepairman> some clients are weird, i guess
<Dashite> of the stream
<ValtheJean> Quick! Find me the Inception noise button!
<GGgala> eeyup. had to do something
<InsertCupcake> I think the stream at the end is waving at me
<Azreck> 5I can see FOREVEEEERRRR
<Silvermane> wait, this is fluttershy?
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Turgle> total mindfuck
<Sumica> Yes Silvermane
<DecapKing> Hey Fluttershy
<GGgala> (the answer is also eeyup)
*Silvermane hugs Fluttershy. "BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HUGGED ANYONE TODAY"
<herospirit> Ohai Fluttershy :3
<Ziltoid> FLUTTERSHY IS BEST PONY
<Sockwear_Moon> And that's why I always do that in the GeekShed window.
<Sockwear_Moon> :P
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Reasoning?
<FallSilently> Don't worry, Lilfut, I doubt anybody cares.
<Silvermane> ^
<AllisZero> ^^
<GGgala> haven't seen him in that before
<bicyclerepairman> and why i use autoidentify
<JackiePie> Yup
<Sumica> some one ask for inception horn?
*RobotPinkie hugs Silvermane. "...because I already hugged Fluttershy."
<bicyclerepairman> i can even typo accidentally
<Sumica> http://inception.davepedu.com/
*thunder-colt strolls into the chat casually
<Sketchy_Sounds> And that's how Equestria was made
<DeniedExistenceMobile> In what!
<JackiePie> lol
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ?
<DecapKing> 4http://miburl.com/4ROCIN
<GGgala> RP
<GGgala> that kind, i mean
<bicyclerepairman> *can't
<bicyclerepairman> derp
<ValtheJean> mwahahahaa
<ValtheJean> thank you sumica
<FallSilently> Equestria has more origin stories than the Joker.
<Sockwear_Moon> I bet 98.3% of them are asleep anyway.
*DecapKing hugs Fluttershy
<JackiePie> I know this might be blasphemy to some, but the Galaxy Girls cartoon Lauren's been working on, doesn't seem half bad.
<WhatPayne> Make noises
*Silvermane eats a bagel
<Charlie_Horse> ...why would that be blasphemous?
*herospirit hugs Herospirit "...SO ALONE"
<bicyclerepairman> she does a cartoon about them now? cool
<WhatPayne> or ponies
<DecapKing> i can have some bagel SilverMane?
*Luna hugs Herospirit
<HaysforPonies> I don't have much opinion on it, but I wish her the best of luck with it.
<FallSilently> *Pinkie Pie points at her cutie mark* Wanna know how I got these scars?
<rachel> because it's all bad? ;-)
<rachel> (haven't seen anything of it)
<herospirit> <3
<JackiePie> I thought some people would be like "No! Lauren should have stayed with ponies!"
<WhatPayne> Oh, I casnt draw
<DeniedExistenceMobile> D'Awwwww....you wanted Dashite to please you....
<Sockwear_Moon> So its true that she isn't working on FiM anymore/
<DeniedExistenceMobile> <3
<HaysforPonies> She's still watching over it.
<Sockwear_Moon> ?*
*Silvermane feeds herospirit to decapking. "It's a bagel! I swear!"
<HaysforPonies> She's like executive producer or something now.
<SomeponyElse> She can do more than one thing at once, you know.
<Sockwear_Moon> Well, that's good. They can't pick up the idiot ball and run with it without some effort then.
*VioletVanilla hugs herospirit as well
<KershaFangs> Her independent project is very nice. She doesn't plan on making it an animated show anyways.
<WhatPayne> Keep drawing
<herospirit> Eat me to gain my courage, decap
*Silvermane hugs Luna. Because Luna. Also, NMM, but for now Luna
<Turgle> uuuh i like drawings
<Sockwear_Moon> Lies, multitasking is a myth.
<JackiePie> Oh, I thought she was going to do that?
<DecapKing> what i meant to ask for was a cookie SilverMane
<JackiePie> So she's just selling dolls?
<KershaFangs> She WAS executive Producer. Season 2, she's Creative producer, and she won't have her name on season 3.
<Sumica> herospirit never say it taht way again.
<herospirit> Also more <3 for Violet :3
<Silvermane> sorry, out of cookies
*RobotPinkie hugs Nightmare Moon
<Pinkie_Pie> Ziltoid, I want a 10 page essay on why you think Fluttershy is best pony
*DecapKing hugs Luna because i havent done that in a while
<WhatPayne> Why not do both?
<Dashite> >_>
<herospirit> ...Sumica what are you taliking abo-
<herospirit> ...
<InsertCupcake> lol i went to pick up my cousin from after school club wearing my derpy hoody and some little kids recognised it and started giggling
<herospirit> Oh gog I'm sorry
<bicyclerepairman> i thought it was assistant producer?
<GGgala> oh, you
<KershaFangs> YeahDolls and a book I think, once she gets enough pages done.
<RobotPinkie> gog?
<ValtheJean> lol, like a baws insertcupcake
<JackiePie> I saw the book, that's cool then.
<Lilfut> so i never play hack n slash
<Lilfut> but that pony level in diablo 3 sure is enticing
<Denied_Existence> InsertCupcakes you have a derby hoody? D'awwwwwww
<rachel> unlike us poor fanboys and fangrrls the people who actually *make* the show probably aren't that obsessed and have career plans you know :-)
<DecapKing> well im jelly, Fluttershy
<Thorinair> yeah
<thunder-colt> hey, mind if you guys help me a bit?
<Silvermane> ^
<InsertCupcake> Its my new favourite piece of clothing
<JackiePie> To be honest, I think it will be nice for African American girls, seeing as a good number of the Galaxy Girls are African American.
<Silvermane> WOOOOO
<Turgle> draw a flying carrot!
<Sumica> heh you are like Light, just with dramatic drawing instead of writing.
<Sockwear_Moon> Google Docs, y u being difficult.
<Thorinair> Lilfut: when I saw it I almost hurtmyself with happiness :P
<ValtheJean> you can't hear it on your end, but I'm pressing that inception button at _very_ comical times
<Thorinair> its obvious its complete MLP reference
<JackiePie> And they don't really have much variety in African American dolls.
<Thorinair> just look at boss names
<Denied_Existence> 3In wonderful green.
<Lilfut> and yet i hate the entire hack n slash genre
<RobotPinkie> double streambow all the way across the stream
<Lilfut> WHAT DO
<GGgala> heh.
<Denied_Existence> 3And back on the laptop
<GGgala> nice to see you off the phone again :D
<Thorinair> think of yourself as pinkamena on rampage
<Silvermane> sure, why the fuck not
<Sumica> I might have to make use of that button later on ValtheJean,
<herospirit> Streambow Dash
<RobotPinkie> streambow't willie
<bicyclerepairman> d3 needs to be online all the time, so i probably will not buy it
<thunder-colt> LONG STORY SHORT: i need to pick ONE picture of rainbow dash for that vote on my homework yesterday
<ValtheJean> see Sumica, I even pressed it to your comment :P
<Denied_Existence> 3Yep
<Silvermane> You mean... that right there is... you can do better on paper... WAT
<ValtheJean> it works for everything!
<bicyclerepairman> playing it on the other handâ¦ <_<
<Sumica> Altho i might scare the ever livving crap out of people.
<lovelybell0025> hi
<Denied_Existence> 3You still reading prince-dari?
<WhatPayne> DA name?
<Charlie_Horse> Hi.
<VioletVanilla> 6Five minute perspective drawings ready? go! :3
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> PONI
<herospirit> PONIES
<GGgala> classes all over?
<HaysforPonies> I was at first annoyed with the online thing but looking into it I understood why they did it.
<RobotPinkie> well, I do like ponies
<Silvermane> Guys, I have a confession. I like ponies.
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah
<prince-dari> Hmm
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> POAHNEEES
<Turgle> ^
<WhatPayne> Me too!
<Sumica> No wai!
<Turgle> oh dude
<RobotPinkie> WAT Silvermane?
<Sockwear_Moon> Et tu, Blizzard?

<Wrek> 05Looking good Fluttershy. :D
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh silverman why didn
<Ziltoid> Guys,guys
<Silvermane> I know, it's weird and all, but there it is
<Ziltoid> I love ponies
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> FUCK YOU ENTER KEY
<GGgala> excellent
<bicyclerepairman> sure, i can understand it tooâ¦ but my connection is stupid sometimes
<DecapKing> I AM SO JEALOUS OF YOU FLUTTERSHY!
<Denied_Existence> 3What part are you up to?
<Lordlyhour> It is cold
<RobotPinkie> yeah, that IS fuckin' weird, Silvermane
<JackiePie> You know what would be cool, is if Lauren made a Play & Read version of the Galaxy Girls book for Nook.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> MAKING ME POST STUFF TOO EARLY
<WhatPayne> Deviantart Name? What is it?
<HaysforPonies> It's basically to prevent exploitation of items online to rig the real cash/game gold market.
<JackiePie> You can put little animations in it and stuff.
<VioletVanilla> 6Love it Fluttershy!
<Lordlyhour> There is a dinstict lack of food I can warm
<DecapKing> 4hey Dari has no color
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> i see a poni
<RobotPinkie> I'll never be able to look at you the same way again :(
<Fluttershy> http://kimikonyanchan.deviantart.com
*Luna loves it too
<Silvermane> RobotPinkie, I expect you to be supportive as I go through this difficult time in my life
<Lordlyhour> This leaves Lordlyhour as a Very Unhappy camper
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah...because he is in here...
<WhatPayne> Oh thank you
<DecapKing> it would take me forever to make something like that
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> I SEE YOUR POAHKNEEES
<HaysforPonies> And I knew someone who made thousands off the Diablo 2 economy.
<RobotPinkie> Well, okay Silvermane
<bicyclerepairman> and because of my connection, i don't play online that often :-/
<RobotPinkie> it's not as if you have lupus, though
<Lordlyhour> However. There are eggs. Eggs are Lordlyhour's bestes freinds even
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> i joined early this year
*Silvermane hugs Luna and Fluttershy. "BEST TWO PONIES DAAAWWWWWWWW"
<prince-dari> I never use colour outside of #bronystate.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> no wait
<prince-dari> I like black best.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> late last year
<Denied_Existence> Hey Sivermane, you coming into the shipping channel?
<JackiePie> eggy-weggs!
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> HOWSE
*Luna loves House too
<Denied_Existence> Silvermane*
<Lordlyhour> Because they are cooking right now. and will soo enter hill belly, spreading their warmth
<prince-dari> It's white on a black background, but default is white background for IRC.
<Silvermane> Denied_existence... NEVAH
<prince-dari> The colour is actually black.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> HOUSE IS TEAM TO CREDIT
<GGgala> oh, you use a white background dari?
*VioletVanilla loves House so much now~
<prince-dari> Mibbit is flipping it.
<ValtheJean> "I love house" INCEPTION BUTTON PRESSED
<herospirit> You're all like
<Silvermane> I lied
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> BRRRRRRM
<GGgala> so that's why you use the highlights in #BronyState
*Lordlyhour is very slightly Delirious, In case you couldn't tell
<Thorinair> http://i.imgur.com/YDSOT.jpg
*VioletVanilla had never heard of House before BronyState o:
<Denied_Existence> 3xD
<InsertCupcake> i cant find an inception button app on the appstore
<DecapKing> 4i can see that you did
<Thorinair> this is me
<herospirit> "HAHAHA SHE HAS CANCER THAT CRACKS ME UP!"
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> house poni
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> yes
*Luna must see that!
<Thorinair> altho I dont mind the ponies
<Thorinair> :P
*GGgala missed the lie
<RobotPinkie> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3bbbef6db74a99a456f246b79825c866/54551%20-%20apple_bloom%20apple_clan%20applejack%20apples%20artist%3Aemlan%20big_macintosh%20comic%20mafia%20oc%20pear%20pears.png oh wow
<Denied_Existence> 3Silvermane, the log is in the topic
<Ziltoid> but
<Silvermane> highlights? what now?
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> i want a house poni
<InsertCupcake> they must be talking bout lupus
<Ziltoid> how are you gonna do the cane for house?
<Sockwear_Moon> Eh, I'm delirious myself. People thought it was a good idea to wake me up every hour to fix some problem or another.
<Denied_Existence> 3You may want to skip the parts you were here for.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> apple mafia
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> BEATIN' STICK
<Lordlyhour> Apparantly, I decided it was a good idea not to sleep
<KershaFangs> Going to do my homework. Only two problems in Calculus but I have to do a study guide of The Awakening and I don't know if I dislike it yet. The way Chopin writes physical descriptions reminds me of fanfiction writer. Just a paragraph of basic physical description and kinda randomly put in there.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> STREAMCEPTION
<Turgle> apple mafia xD
<Sockwear_Moon> And since it takes me about an hour to fall asleep...
<Pinkie_Pie> That comic...
<VioletVanilla> 6PEARS O^O THE INFAMOUS EVIL
<AllisZero> Applejack's face is priceless
<Turgle> eeeyup
<RobotPinkie> mafiaception
<DecapKing> Fluttershy swears O.O
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> I HATE PEARS
<JackiePie> lol Thorinair
<herospirit> Appljack is gonna make you an offer you can't refuse
*ValtheJean wishes you could hear every time he pressed the button :(
<Lordlyhour> I wasn't informed of this desiscion however. But what starrted with a breif check of a forum lead to something like 10 hours of just zoning out
<Sumica> So how many more viewers did Fluttershy just get =p
<WhatPayne> Favorite non-mane-6 pony?
<GGgala> (by highlights i meant dari's white background on his blue text)
<DecapKing> Jk i swear all the time
<Lordlyhour> Watching my tiny little Ds screen
<Luna> 07+32
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> 999,999,999,999
<Lordlyhour> as it filled with words. Words I had to read
<Denied_Existence> Oh my god you sound so close to flutter shy.
<Denied_Existence> <3
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> i'm watching my posts get put on the stream
<DecapKing> yes you do
<Silvermane> <3 for the sake of <3
<Sockwear_Moon> So kind of like me and fanfics.
*MrDrProfSgtBrony is a pie
<Lordlyhour> Now, I'm wondering why Llamas seemed so important and amazing at the time.
<Denied_Existence> You have the right pitch
<Sockwear_Moon> Well, if the fanfics I'm tracking would update, anyway.
<Denied_Existence> And you have the right amount of shyness.
<Silvermane> If you squeeked, you'd have all of our hearts forever miss Fluttershy.
<DecapKing> manly <3 for the hell of it
*Lordlyhour knows the feeling
<Wrek> 05I missed the link :C
<WhatPayne> Who?
<Denied_Existence> ........
<AllisZero> What's your DA again?
<Wrek> 05would anypony be so kind to link?

<Denied_Existence> Take my money!!! TAKE ALL OF IT

<Denied_Existence> We heard you liked streams, so we put a stream in your stream so you can stream while you stream.
<GGgala> lawl, i'm headphoneless atm and can't play it, so...

<Barry> Reminds me of that one gif image of Apple Bloom's cutie mark being of Apple Bloom with a cutie mark and it would zoom in indefinitely
<Sumica> I like watching the delay of the text moveing on each one.
<InsertCupcake> its not my fault!
<AllisZero> Uhh
<GGgala> where did all the BJ refs come from?!
<Denied_Existence> Streamception is best ception.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> i know a person who has fluttershy's personality

<Pinkie_Pie> Fluttershy, how can you of all people not be scared by random loud noises..
<Silvermane> Rarity is tied for 3rd best pony
<Sketchy_Sounds> Ah nuts

<Sumica> Inb4 Neaighsayers
<cbplz> lalalala
<Lordlyhour> and then blame Luna
<Silvermane> 15reading what
<DecapKing> 4mfw silvermane actually was reading and not preoccupied in BronyState chat
<Pinkie_Pie> Fluttershy, you should get Sethisto to hear that
<Lilfut> from a gameplay point of view, what characters do you think the mane six would use in smash bros?
<WhatPayne> Invisible, what ever do you mean?
<ValtheJean> I didn't :P
<Pinkie_Pie> He will want to marry you
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<Denied_Existence> ValtheJean Y U NO COLOR!?

<Denied_Existence> 3http://pastebin.com/bVmMizEe
<herospirit> I CANT SPELL IN PAIN
<cbplz> lol
<Barry> ok. tell us your idea
<Denied_Existence> 3Well he was here for most of it...
<Dashite> IDEA! I know how to deafen everyone on the stream!
<cbplz> you just dud
<cbplz> did
<Silvermane> 15meh
<thunder-colt> technically, rule under celestia is a kingship
<Sumica> I am so using that horn button now.
<Lordlyhour> Twi'd be all up in some Ganondorf, I think
<InsertCupcake> soon...
<Luna> 07Oh yes! Great idea
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qp_nMntvR8
<Luna> 07SOON!
<Denied_Existence> 3You must read the last part Silvermane.
<Denied_Existence> 3IT IS IMPERATIVE
<thunder-colt> if luna gets in the game again, it would be an aristocracy
<GGgala> not for Denied's Excellent Adventure, thoguh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I for one welcome our pony overlords
<DecapKing> 4gets interesting towards the end
<GGgala> *though
<Beefchief> But seriously, Applebloom's cutie mark. What should it be? A nail and cardboard?
<Lilfut> i actually think she would go for marths technical metagame
<herospirit> Spontanious angry bee post
<Pinkie_Pie> Luna, Y U NO TURN VOLUME DOWN?
<Pinkie_Pie> This is why I need to go AFK
<Pinkie_Pie> >.>
<thunder-colt> !moon
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a bucket of glue *trollface*
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, thunder-colt!
<InsertCupcake> buzz
<Lordlyhour> Fluttershy would play as luigi
<thunder-colt> diiineeer
<Pinkie_Pie> For some reason I cant leave though.. Must be Fluttershy's voice
<Sketchy_Sounds> Right. Going to attempt to sleep. Catch you folks later.
<Luna> 07because we resume with house soon ;)
<Beefchief> Could you imagine the CMC getting cutie marks and they're all hideous cutie marks?
<Lordlyhour> and destroy EVERYONE
<WhatPayne> oh, VioletVanilla Did you not go somewhere? Just noticed you have been here quite a while...
<Lordlyhour> pinkie would be kirby
<Beefchief> Like the ugliest cutie marks in all of equestria
<RobotPinkie> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-be-afraid-of-sweetie-belle.jpg
<Lordlyhour> Rainbow... I can;t imagine stickig to one character
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> ALL THE BRONIES IN THIS STREAM ARE CRAZY!!!
<Sumica> Pinkie_Pie is always there
*WhatPayne is embarrassed
<Lordlyhour> Probably link if she did though
<VioletVanilla> 6I did go take a nap earlier, but now I'm back WhatPayne :3
<InsertCupcake> lol
<Mason_Trowel> Dash would be, Sonic, of course
<cbplz> haha
<Lilfut> i think pinkie would go more for wario in gameplay terms
*VioletVanilla wraps both hooves around WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> aww
<^Stargazer> sonic's not a starter character I don't think
<Mason_Trowel> He's got speed, and when smash balls are on, he's broken as heck.
<Lordlyhour> NAw
<Lordlyhour> Dash wants to win
<Denied_Existence> 3Well put DecapKing, well put.
*Fluttershy hugs WhatPayne
<^Stargazer> Dash would be Meta Knight
*WhatPayne does counterhug to VioletVanilla
<^Stargazer> broken hit boxes
<WhatPayne> a-ha!
<Charlie_Horse> Naw; Pit.
<Lordlyhour> Just because Sonic is fast doesn't mean Dashy'd want to be him
<Lilfut> im talking once the full roster is unlocked now you two
<Charlie_Horse> All that flying around.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> SOMEONE PLAY THE SQUEE
<VioletVanilla> Worry not mein freund~
<VioletVanilla> 6but what is counterhug?
<Barry> Only honeybees have barbed stingers
<ShadTheCrazed> I whip anything with Falco.
<User_2227PartyCrash> New VG cats references PONIES
*Silvermane hugs everypony at once in a pinkie-pie arm stretch
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Good News Everypony
<Sumica> Who made Fluttershy cry?
<Lilfut> i do think dash would go for pits cheapness
<ShadTheCrazed> User_2227PartyCrash: NEED LINK NAO
*Silvermane specifically hugs Fluttershy to stop her tears. No crying
<Lordlyhour> Are we talking who'd play who, based on their strategies
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> You beetter all get your gear ready
<WhatPayne> Well more of an preemptive-hug
*VioletVanilla is sucked into Silvermane's hug~
<^Stargazer> "your too slow" "your too slow" "your too slow"
<Lordlyhour> or based on their personalitiies?
<Pinkie_Pie> Not when I lose connection Sumica
<^Stargazer> =D
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Cause The Pinnacle Of Ponies is coming
<User_2227PartyCrash> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/
<DecapKing> SilverMane, dont hug me
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> FLUTTERSHY NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> DON
<Barry> except for the queen, who like every other stinging insect has a straight stinger
<Mason_Trowel> ...?
<DecapKing> we have to brohoof
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> my keyboard
<Mason_Trowel> Pinnacle of Ponies?
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> i hate it so
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> The Secret Diablo 3 Level has been Revealed
<Lilfut> strategies lordly
*Ziltoid creates hugblackhole
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> The Pinnacle of Ponies
<Lordlyhour> Yeah
<Pinkie_Pie> Anyway, why does your voice prevent me from leaving Fluttershy?
<^Stargazer> I don't understand, what's with the eyes that makes him go gaga?
<Lordlyhour> Rainbow would NOT chose sonic
<Lordlyhour> Probably captain falcon
<GGgala> dari, you reading it or giving up?
<herospirit> I am Doctor Personal Space
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> The normal mobs are probably called Rainbow Western
<VioletVanilla> 6mfw> I thought Barry was talking about th queen of England D:
<Beefchief> Try doing an Apple Bloom voice
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> The bosses are
<Lordlyhour> SOnic is very much a guerilla fighting character
<herospirit> and I will ERADICATE ALL HUGS FROM THE EARTH
<Lordlyhour> In quik, out quick
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Midnight Sparkle
<Lilfut> i think shed go for pit or meta knight, for the brokenness
<herospirit> BUWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Nightmarity
<Lordlyhour> Dashie is a full, head on barrage
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Nightmare Is Magic
<Barry> nope, the leader of the bees and wasps is called a queen
<^Stargazer> nightmare shy
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> And Generosity in Death
<^Stargazer> >_>
<InsertCupcake> "mai curie mark must have something to do with apples!"
<Lordlyhour> wow
<Barry> but she rarely, if ever attacks a threat herself
*Pinkie_Pie braces for random Apple bloom quotes at max volume, from Luna, of course
<Lordlyhour> a game is putting poies in
<InsertCupcake> "apples apples apples apples, huh appuls"
<ShadTheCrazed> Our back burner for the stove suddenly shorted out when it wasn't even ON. o_o
*Lordlyhour Jazzhands
<herospirit> Barry is M.C. Knows Way Too Many Facts About Bees
<Mason_Trowel> Do they have screenshots now or something, or are you just coming up with things off the top of your head?
<Sumica> DO it Luna!
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> From what I read you will have a race with time to purify Evil Tentacle Ponies into normal Ponies
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> now do zecora
<Beefchief> oh lawd
<Sumica> wrong apple
<InsertCupcake> 15 mph you say?
<Barry> wait a minute, appul is a character in DBZ
<DecapKing> HOLY SHIT!
<Pinkie_Pie> ARGH
<WhatPayne> Counterhugâ¢ is hug deployed to stop from getting hugged by applying "another hug as counter"
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Nope its confirmed from the D3 data
<herospirit> mmmmyyyyyy waaaaaaarrrrrrrsssss
<prince-dari> I glanced over the end of it.
<Mason_Trowel> Where'd you read it? Link me.
<Lordlyhour> Has anyone considered this?
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Check the mmo champion
<Lordlyhour> The whole secret pony level?
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh yeah, and did I mention I kick all flank with Falco?
<Lordlyhour> Its a hoax
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> www.mmo-champion.com
<Lordlyhour> Because blizzard are dicks like that
<^Stargazer> lol Yogscast XD
<WhatPayne> ...I'm so weirded out by my own text right now...
<Pinkie_Pie> Thanks Luna, you have given me all I need to finally go AFK
<InsertCupcake> omg thewres a pony wtf collective
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Actually I pretty believe this is true
<Luna> 07See you in a bit Pinkie_Pie
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> As Blizzard has copyrighted everything but that
<InsertCupcake> must watch
*Pinkie_Pie turns off the stream and walks away, ears ringing
<ShadTheCrazed> A secret pony level for WoW?!
<Lilfut> so, what would aj use?
<^Stargazer> Diabolos 3
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> For Diablo 3
<Beefchief> scootalooooo? scoootaloooooo?
<Luna> 07Fluttershy?
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh.
<RobotPinkie> yeah my head hurts
<Lordlyhour> Aj...
<Lordlyhour> Rob, maybe
<Beefchief> scoot-scoot-scootalooooooo
<Mason_Trowel> Oh, so it's just the data that Seth and them posted up yesterday
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> For WoW I think they might be thinking of something
<ShadTheCrazed> Only my bro plays WoW, though.
<Wrek> 05highly likley
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> WE ARE
<Lordlyhour> He's a character you need to be patient with
<Mason_Trowel> I was thinking they put out screenshots or something.
<Dashite> Guys, if they want to read it, they will. Bugging them to read it every 5 seconds isn't going to do anything.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> SAY MOAR
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> PLEASE!
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> It's a little hard to put screenshots now. Its still on beta
<Sumica> Borderline creepy.
<Lordlyhour> Though I can see her getting pro with DeDeDe
<dashie> dunno, Im new...
<WhatPayne> Quote the show with Pinkie Pie voice.
<Lilfut> i think aj would go more for a full frontal assault sort of character
<Lordlyhour> Pinkie would definitely play as Kirby
<Lilfut> maybe captain falcon?
<Lilfut> NO PINKIE IS WARIO
<Lordlyhour> I can see that
<DecapKing> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPLyykueP00&feature=related
<Lordlyhour> But aj is a more restrained pony that dash
<WhatPayne> Quotes, quick!
<Lordlyhour> SO not ALL out, unless she's being baited
<Barry> And whoever said I know way too many things about bees, I like to know all about the creatures I fear
<Lordlyhour> Pinkie, I think
<Lordlyhour> WOuld be Olimar
<prince-dari> Another hater converted into a brony.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Lordlyhour> and would just seriously be pro with him
<Luna> 07indeed he is
<Mails-Pinkaminus-Prowers> Good Night from me
<prince-dari> ^ wut?
<herospirit> So I think I finished my Ponytailed Pinkie Pie http://soshable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Everything_went_better_than_expected.png
<Mason_Trowel> Good night
<Pinkie_Pie> Still not AFK...
<WhatPayne> "Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. "
<Pinkie_Pie> WHY?
<Lilfut> i think pinkie would go for wario's jerky playstyle
<Wrek> 05house is a brony.
<Lordlyhour> Like, God tier, singlehoofedly getting him banned from ever competition ever, Pro
<Lilfut> maybe diddy too, actually
<Silvermane> 15lawl wut
<Silvermane> 15DecapKing

<Luna> 07:)
<ShadTheCrazed> Downloading General Mumble's CLOP /)^3^(\ album. :DDDD
<GGgala> heh. you haven't seen that before?
<Wrek> 05ooo, close
<Sumica> Nice
<dashie> d'aaww
<VioletVanilla> 6House is also a kitty~
<Silvermane> 15i probably have, but i hate the song and it's a bit graphic in this context
<VioletVanilla> 6Good job Fluttershy! :DD
<Lordlyhour> Spike'd go for yoshi
<GGgala> ...
<Barry> huh?
<Mason_Trowel> I don't know...
<GGgala> >a bit graphic
<Sumica> well taht was spot on.
<User_5735> do what you want cuz a piate is free, you are a pirate!!!
<GGgala> what channel am i in? >_>
<dashie> awwwww
<herospirit> Which one was the sound clip?
<Sumica> and luna with the comparason.
<Barry> *inhales loudly* yay!
<DecapKing> 4my thoughts exactly
<rachel> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, rachel!
<Lordlyhour> Just because spike is a kid
<redd> nooo
<dashie> again again
<Luna> 07almost
<Charlie_Horse> A piate? Opiate? You dealing drugs in here?!
<Luna> 07keep trying
<redd> why do people kick themselves so much?
<Lordlyhour> and would think, eh, he's a lizard, I'm a lizard
<ShadTheCrazed> Do what you want 'cuz a brony is free, you are a brony!
<Lordlyhour> and Like all kids
<Mason_Trowel> I'[m thinking he'd be an aesthetic player, and play Pokemon Trainer for Charizard.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> fluttershy
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> you
<Lordlyhour> He'd be annoyingly good
<Mason_Trowel> Dragon, dragon.
<redd> darnit!
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> are such a loudmouth
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> hehehehe
<redd> solo aint in here!
<Barry> At the beginning of the episode she's meek.
<Fluttershy> :<
<Lordlyhour> Maybe bowser?
<Mason_Trowel> He'll be on around in about 2+ hours redd
<Barry> But when Rainbow Dash performs her signature move, her meekness disappears
<redd> welp, theres only one thing to do!
<herospirit> EVEN HER SHNEEZES ARE GRACEFOOL
<^Stargazer> lol @ Yogscast
<Lilfut> i think spike would go for an easy character
<redd> join EAD!
<Lilfut> like maybe mario
<ShadTheCrazed> I'd love to battle the mane six in SSBB.
<Sumica> nice herospirit
<Silvermane> 15I suppose you may ride on The Great and Powerful Trixie's superior posterior for a while longer."
<^Stargazer> "Are ponies suppose to have wings?" "I think it's part of the moon kin"
<herospirit> I try :p
<Lordlyhour> Twi would either be an epic noob
<Silvermane> 15If i had a nickle for every time i've heard /that/ line
<Lordlyhour> or seriously PRO
<^Stargazer> >_>
<Barry> you mispelled graceful
<Lordlyhour> No inbetween
<Lordlyhour> No chance of that
<dashie> o rly?
<GGgala> dohohoho
<ergopossum> Whatup bronies
<Barry> and I misspelled "misspelled"
<DecapKing> http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/party-hard-b.gif
<GGgala> that was a fun intermission
<herospirit> I realize. It was spelled Fonically :0
<Charlie_Horse> Mmm, brownies...
<Lilfut> as i mentioned, twi would probably go for marth's technical playstyle
<InsertCupcake> you better be
<Ziltoid> Poof
*Luna claps bravo bravo!
<WhatPayne> poof?
<Barry> ah, you were trying to get Photo Finish's accent down on paper
<ShadTheCrazed> So what Pokemon do you think the mane six would fit?
<ergopossum> is this a discussion of what brawl characters the mane six would select
<Lordlyhour> Pondering which pony would play which character is SuperSmashBrosBrawl
<herospirit> Yes, it's difficult
<DecapKing> 4what intermission?
<Barry> some accents are easier to write than others
<ergopossum> it is as I feared, then
<GGgala> Boombox's Trixie fic
<Ziltoid> FRENCH?
<Lvs> this qualifies at research, actually
<Ziltoid> WUT
<WhatPayne> pomf?
<Barry> I find AJ's accent the easiest to write
<VioletVanilla> 6German XD
<herospirit> Wat?
<InsertCupcake> I thought it was more german
<dashie> D:
<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm... Rarity would choose either Peach or Zelda.
<Lvs> since it's for a story
<Lordlyhour> on merits of their tactics, rather than their personalities
<herospirit> German you SILLY AMERICAN
<Sumica> wrong button luna
<Lordlyhour> ARe you serious? Hell no
<Lordlyhour> Rarity'd be all over snake
<dashie> yey house time
<ShadTheCrazed> Oh, what Pokemon teams do you think the mane six would have?
<Mason_Trowel> Hey, don't be dissing Peach and Zelda
<InsertCupcake> ive never noticed dat transition before
<DecapKing> 4oh
<WhatPayne> Moar House
<Ziltoid> dat song
<Mason_Trowel> I kick some serious butt with those two
<InsertCupcake> at the start just then
<ShadTheCrazed> Lordlyhour: You have a point.
<Lilfut> i think pinkie would go for diddy, g&w, and/or wario
<herospirit> PHOTO FINISH IST EINE DUETSCHERIN
<bicyclerepairman> good night everypony!
<WhatPayne> InsertCupcake: Me neither
<Charlie_Horse> night!
<RobotPinkie> oh we're watching House again? :O
<Mason_Trowel> So long, bicycle
<Blott> ergopossum is noob
<Fluttershy> Guess I'll back on later or whenever is the right time o-o
<DecapKing> 4http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-so-thats-where-it-goes-moderation-funnel-beer-drinking-bewbs.jpg
<Lordlyhour> Pinkie is an Olimar. Or a Kirby
<Leika> I bet Fluttershy would pick Pkmn Trainer, or Kirby
<RobotPinkie> damn i almost missed it
<Blott> <3
<herospirit> You're a mean one, Mr. House
<ergopossum> I am new here
<Sumica> House is a humbug, would have never guessed.
<Barry> I wonder what part of Equestria PF comes from to have such an accent
<Lordlyhour> Fluttershy'd be all over DK
<^Stargazer> pikachu, reminds her of angle
<Ziltoid> oh fuck
<Lordlyhour> no wait
<Lordlyhour> Angel would be DK
<Charlie_Horse> How parasprites spread, simplified version: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1UYsqf2hw
<Lilfut> i think fluttershy would go for a defensive- oriented character
<ShadTheCrazed> But still, I'd just love to see what the mane six would pick for SSBB, and either help them in Adventure mode or fight 'em.
<Lordlyhour> FLuttershy would be luigi
<Mason_Trowel> Fluttershy wouldn't want to be play, cuz it's so violent, but then when she's pressganged into doing so, she'd pick something cute.
<Blott> I imagine flutter shy as olimar
<DecapKing> 4http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-isnt-that-the-name-of-a-drink-beach-bjs.jpg
<Blott> picking pikmin
<Mason_Trowel> There wouldn't be any tactics for her.
<Blott> then protecting them
<ergopossum> Meta Knight seems the most like Rainbow Dash as far as abilities
<Blott> or sonic...
<DecapKing> 4WHY GOD WHY?!?!?!?!?!? http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-whats-the-point-exactly-vodka-non-alcoholic.jpg
<Leika> I think Rainbow Dash would pick Pit...
<Charlie_Horse> Yes!
<Blott> truetrue
<Lordlyhour> yus, but we're debating as to their tactics
<Blott> ah
<Lordlyhour> not similarities between the characters
<RobotPinkie> he's not a nice guy
<Blott> right
<Mason_Trowel> Yeah, but even in the talk of tactics, whether or not they actually want to play is a big part
<Ziltoid> OH SHIT
<Lordlyhour> Rainbow dash, would be CAptain falconhe hits hard and Moves fast
<Lilfut> maybe one of the fe characters?
<RobotPinkie> House kinda deserves it in this case, though...
<Mason_Trowel> Fluttershy wouldn't be playing to win, she'd just sort of BE there.
<Dashite> Trololol
*Fluttershy hugs Luna :3
<herospirit> *HouseStare*
<Sumica> Dat glare
<Lordlyhour> Oh. I dunnop
*Luna smiles at Fluttershy
<Lordlyhour> I can see FLuttershy slowly becoming enthralled
<Leika> She'd probably say "Oh! I'm sorry!" whenever she hits someone XD
<ValtheJean> confound these lunas, they drive me to be addicted to House
<Lilfut> do you know why im asking this btw?
*ValtheJean hugs luna
<ergopossum> Scootaloo as Wario
<ergopossum> I'm calling it
<Lordlyhour> and just suprising everyone by destroying them
<Fluttershy> ^^
<VioletVanilla> 6Don't confound them, love them~ <3
<GGgala> that's worse than fat-free half & half
<VioletVanilla> 6Thank you for that Fluttershy! :3
<Lordlyhour> You're making the Smashbros series of comics?
<Lilfut> ive been brought on as cowriter for elements of gaming to make up for the authors' lack of nintendo knowledge
<ValtheJean> indeed, thank you very much fluttershy
<herospirit> Counfound my memory, It drives me to remember I have homework
<Lordlyhour> Oh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 in fact, I'll even thank you in colors :P
<Lordlyhour> Also cool
<Lvs> i just read the most recent chapter
<Lilfut> and i want to kick off with smash
<Fluttershy> I'm glad I could be of... um... service? o-o
<Ziltoid> LAWL
<Lordlyhour> I Don't actually READ that fic
<Silvermane> 15WHO IS THIS EMERALD MARE AND WHY HAVEN'T I SHIPPED HER YET
<Lordlyhour> ut cool anyways
*RobotPinkie hugs Fluttershy instead, since everyone else is busy hugging Luna
*WhatPayne hugs Luna just for the sake of Luna
*DecapKing hugs Fluttershy
<^Stargazer> Pinkie pie would somehow get into the game and win
*VioletVanilla hugs the sky because lollipops
<DecapKing> ask DE
<GGgala> Denied's fuckbuddy or something
*Luna hugs the entire room
*Fluttershy is hugged, squeaks. O_O
<Lordlyhour> Pinkie is OLIMAR
<Lordlyhour> God-Tier Olimar
<Sumica> hah house lashing out at everyone.
<WhatPayne> Extra hug for Fluttershy from here too
<Lvs> pinkie pie would probably be lucky enough to always have great items drop right on her head
*WhatPayne hugs Fluttershy
<Lordlyhour> but ahe'd never get them
<Lordlyhour> Because she'd be all Pinkiesensing on the couch
*herospirit hugs the wall because he got confused
<Lordlyhour> and vgetting distracted
<Silvermane> 15also, which furry artist is she?
<Silvermane> 15i may have seen some of her work
*VioletVanilla is on the hunt for a snack~
<WhatPayne> herospirit, that can happen
<RobotPinkie> "cuddy" and "idiop"
*ValtheJean 2,14 hugs Tree (see wut I did thar?) :P
<ShadTheCrazed> So guys, what Pokemon team do you think the mane six would have?
<Sumica> indeed
<RobotPinkie> oh u, ValtheJean :P
<Lordlyhour> I can see AJ and RD getting into a massive Shitfight over the Homerun Bats
<Lilfut> i havent played pokemon in months
<Lvs> i wouldn't interprete pinkie as being easily distracted
<Lvs> she seems to usually be very focused on what she does
<Sumica> Thanks for the entertainment Fluttershy
*RobotPinkie hugs ValtheJean, even though he's not a tree
<Lilfut> when i was playing, i would have been able to answer that without thinking
<Lordlyhour> ...True
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ewwwwww....non-tree
<Lvs> it's just that what she does isn't always what everypony thinks she should be doing
<Denied_Existence> 3She likes to keep to herself.
<Luna> 07She be back!
<RobotPinkie> Well I mean I'd like to be a tree :(
*Luna knows
<herospirit> Hahaha House.
<Ziltoid> ewww
<Fluttershy> I wanna be a tree o-o
<Lilfut> also im still reading eog chapter 5
<Lordlyhour> I can actually see a Pinkie-ypshi or Pinkiechu situation
<Lilfut> i love how immersed the cmc are
<RobotPinkie> LOL
<DecapKing> 4its always the quiet ones.....
<Blott> collecting instruments for the parasprites
<Sumica> House likes some one that bites back
<WhatPayne> This is good episode because the chemistry between House and the mum.
<Blott> she didn't get distracted
<Charlie_Horse> XD
<Lordlyhour> In fact\
<Silvermane> 15all I know is... Shadowmane may have a target >.>
<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm... Trying to think of what team Twilight would have.
<RobotPinkie> indeed, WhatPayne
<Lordlyhour> I think Pinkie coul kick but as just about any ofthe characters
<Denied_Existence> 3*Pffft*
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah....sre
<GGgala> about that, Silver...
<Denied_Existence> 3sure
<Leika> Twilight would likely have a bunch of psychic pokemons
<Lordlyhour> She'd avoid Ganon like the plague though
<Silvermane> 15about what
<Denied_Existence> 3I'd like to see THAT
<Blott> no
<ShadTheCrazed> Maybe.
<Lordlyhour> RD and AJ would have ALL te pokemon
<Blott> she'd convert canon to parties
<Lilfut> again, i think pinkie would go for wario or gnw
<GGgala> Is there an open season on shipping ShadowMane <_<
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I still like the classroom episode :P
<Lordlyhour> Racing each other to catch 'em all
<Silvermane> 15have YOU ever seen shadowmane work over a filly? bastard stole my girlfriend's mother in front of her husband once.
<ShadTheCrazed> I was thinking that Alakazam and Gengar would roll, maybe also Zoroark.
<Lordlyhour> Game And watch
<Metal> Lol
<DecapKing> http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/wtf-photos-videos-invisibilly.jpg
<Metal> nic
<Metal> nice*
<Lordlyhour> theres a charcter I'd forgotten about
<Denied_Existence> 3Lol
<GGgala> at least he didn't steal your girlfriend!
<Fluttershy> :O
<Silvermane> 15naturally the first date didn't go very well after that
<Lordlyhour> Zorua/Zoroark would be very much Rarity pokeman, I think
<Ziltoid> lol dat pic
<Gilda> Hey, 'sup.
<Lordlyhour> The sky
<Lvs> nothin'
<ShadTheCrazed> I wonder what char Gilda would use for SSBB, or Pokemon- Oh heya!
<DecapKing> FLUTTERSHY HE NEED MONEY TO BE CURED!
<Fluttershy> I like that pic. ^^ Hehe.
<Silvermane> 15and that is probably why I've never dated a pegasus
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, it'd be funnier as: "I am a rapture victim. Donate so I can get better. God bless"
<Lordlyhour> Falco
<User_6312> lol
<Wrek> 05PILLS HERE!
<User_6312> whoops
<Fluttershy> Oh my goodness you're right! He needs House!
<Gilda> Me? Smash Bros? Bowser.
<Sumica> MRI it fixes everything including metal lodged in the body.
<Lordlyhour> Thats not a Hey, there both birds thing
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah, I was thinking Falco.
<GGgala> eh? why, he likes 'em with wings?
<Filter> there
<Lordlyhour> Its just how I see her playing.
<ShadTheCrazed> Now all of a sudden, I think Bowser.
<Lordlyhour> maybe wolf
<ShadTheCrazed> But I kick butt with Falco.
<Silvermane> 15if my mother is right, I'm just like Shadow and have a thing for unicorns.
<Gilda> Badass turtle mosnter, spinnin' around knocking chumps every which way... what's not to like?
<Filter> I dont understand how you think any of them could play, considering they have hooves...
<ShadTheCrazed> I just need to get my Wii plugged in and back into the sport of SSBB, though.
<dashie> house 1 - everyone else 0
<Sumica> Did we bring up taht house was right?
<Lordlyhour> THEY PLAY WITH FREINDSHIP!
<Denied_Existence> 3Pegasi all the way bro.
<DecapKing> 4i havent cause Stalliongrad ponies are supposedly too heavy for that cloud walking spell...
<InsertCupcake> ooo i found a subway voucher looks like im eating out tomorrow
<Silvermane> 15If i were to venture a guess based upon my studies during my psychology courses, i may prefer fillies that have a natural advantage over me
<herospirit> House won without even being there
<ShadTheCrazed> 10 minutes of some training with Falco and I'm as good as a pro.
<Wrek> 05actually by now its around 9001-3
<Gilda> Breathes fire, grabs 'em and dive bombs off the edge. Totally my kinda dude.
<Wrek> 05in houses favor ofc
<Lordlyhour> No-one has mentioned ike or marth
<dashie> lol
<Silvermane> 15earth ponies have strength and lack the weak points of wings and hornds
*ValtheJean 2,14 loves subway. had a sandwich when he got out of class
<Silvermane> 15horns*
<Lordlyhour> I personally think Big mac would be very much Ike
<Sumica> BTW house was right.
<AllisZero> What the fuck
<AllisZero> Ponies used to be 6:30
<Silvermane> 15Unicorns have magic and a harder to reach point than wings, which can very easily be used for control
<Denied_Existence> 3I don't know...I wouldn't consider horns to be really sea...
<Denied_Existence> 3weak
<DecapKing> 4yeah but on me the most important weak point is bigger
<Lordlyhour> Yeah, The Bellyflop of doom always is a favourite attack of mine
<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm... I wonder if Gilda plays Pokemon by any chance.
<AllisZero> Why is Jem at 6:30 now
<Silvermane> 15weak point as in sensitive
<ShadTheCrazed> Brb, food.
<Denied_Existence> 3You say the balls, I will eat you.
<Gilda> Nah, no Pokemon.
<Sumica> they changes the schudule yesterday
<Lvs> reminds me of how i made pony character portraits for wizardry 8
<GGgala> DecapKing: you saying what i think you're saying?
<Silvermane> 15he means his nose
<Lvs> big mac makes a fine monk.
<^Stargazer> Gilda has that "they will never know" type secret that gets revealed in season 2
<Lordlyhour> Pokemon is for Dweebs
<dashie> changed^
<AllisZero> That blows, thought I could get 2 episodes in
<DecapKing> 4yeah, i'd say its pretty sensitive....
*Lordlyhour is a dweeb
<Sumica> every thing got bumped up 30min
<Gilda> What?
<Filter> lol
<Lordlyhour> Its... Horrible
*Silvermane 15punches DecapKing in the nose.
<Lordlyhour> It pulls me in
<Sumica> Dont make me brick you dashie
<Silvermane> 15that get you off?
<Lordlyhour> with its completionism
<Lordlyhour> It says "Lordly."
<Lordlyhour> "Ctch them all"
<dashie> lol sorry
<DecapKing> 4nope
<^Stargazer> I'm just messing lol
<Lordlyhour> "It will only take a few months"
<Silvermane> 15good
<CrimsonFoxx> You call yourself a dweeb for liking pokemon when you're in the chat room for a my little pony fan site?
<Lordlyhour> And then, when I'm mostly done
<Lordlyhour> HOROR!
<Lordlyhour> there aren't enough boxes to hold them alkl
*Wrek had a free sushi lunch today.
<Filter> teh hax, betch
<Lordlyhour> My collection is incomplete
<dashie> awesome
<Lordlyhour> BY DESIGN it is incomplete
<Lordlyhour> Forever
<RobotPinkie> no such thing
<Filter> Kill them all and get unknown
<Filter> that solves your problem
<RobotPinkie> ...sushi is delicious, though
<Filter> unkown are much less fun to collect and much worse to look at
<Sumica> you like seasoned rice?
<Wrek> 05aughta have said it was free for me
<Fluttershy> Sushi! I love sushi... ^^
<GGgala> so what *is* your greatest weak point then Decap
<Filter> then you'll realize what a good thing you had and not be down on it so much
<Wrek> 05a friend lost a bet, it was my prize
<Silvermane> 15isn't it obvious?
<Denied_Existence> 3Women.
<InsertCupcake> never had sushi
<Silvermane> 15the glowing red spot
*Luna loves Sushi
<Silvermane> 15hit it for maximum damage
*Wrek brohoofs Fluttershy
<GGgala> for massive damage?!
*Wrek brohoofs Luna aswell
<DecapKing> 4do i really have to say it?
<Silvermane> 15for massive damage

<Sumica> oh my
<GGgala> well that's anticlimactic.
<Silvermane> 15unless you rub it >.>
<herospirit> Oh dear
<Gilda> The Matrix costs waaay too much to run if we leave stuff on like that.
<Lvs> man, just imagine
<Sumica> um luna
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, House is doing exactly what he pretended in the classroom episode :P
<herospirit> House is THE WITTIEST MOTHER FUCKER
<Lvs> you'd log off now, and log on again in 20 years
<Lvs> people would be WAY behind.
<AllisZero> Rofl House
<Luna> 07yes?
*GGgala brohoofs Silvermane for taking the setup
<Gilda> And still waiting for Season 2. And you'd be laughing at them.
<InsertCupcake> dat broken face

<CrimsonFoxx> Has anyone else heard that there's going to be a new Toonami?
<GGgala> lawlll
<Wrek> 05does my brohoof mean that little to you :C
<InsertCupcake> its not been Lupus so many times its got to be Lupus this time!
<dashie> ouch
*Fluttershy brohoofs Wrek back

<User_4189> www.neotoonami.com
<Lvs> find something to do
<Silvermane> 15I do believe that I prefer earth ponies who can pin me by my wings, and unicorns who can use magic to control me. A pegasus filly has the same weaknesses as me, i.e. her wings. Then there was that griffon, Citrine... pure power and grace in that one
<JackiePie> wb
<dashie> yeah, the magician one
<Silvermane> IT'S LUPUS
<MrMooMoo> Well hello Gilda JackiePie ShadTheCrazed and more!
<Fluttershy> Next time I think I want to sing "oh the grand galloping gala is the best place for mee~"
<Lvs> hooray, i am more
<CrimsonFoxx> Yeah, I think it's going to be pretty awesome, especially since they're going to be showing One Piece
<Lvs> helloo
<Gilda> Uh, yeah, dude
<GGgala> Citrine? I thought she had a different name...
<InsertCupcake> House number B
<jasperbot> humm
<MrMooMoo> Lvs i love you too,
<Silvermane> 15i do believe it was Citrine Alexandria
<Silvermane> 15or was it Alexandros
<Filter> One peice has gotten old and smelly by now
<Ziltoid> oh shit
<FallSilently> Never had Toonami, doesn't affect me any.
<Sumica> You so should Fluttershy
<GGgala> ah, yeah. Alex.
<MrMooMoo> Well i will try to do my homeworks now.
<maxaminus> It's not Toonami, but I used to love Space Ghost, it was so friggin' random.
<FallSilently> And that wasn't intended to rhyme.
<Lvs> speaking of gilda, i had her figured for the Samurai class
<dashie> next the uses a harm on his hand...
<Lvs> is that cool?
<dashie> he
<DecapKing> 4http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/funny-graphs-pbytes.jpg
<Gilda> The what?
<Fluttershy> He's cutting himself...? D:
<dashie> hammer
<Wrek> 05yes
<Lvs> in wizardry 8
<Gilda> Never heard of it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 House: The only person who can make cutting your arms not emo
<Lvs> well, it's old
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah, I'm gonna play some Pokemon white.
<herospirit> He's cutting himself... MEDICALLY
*Filter goes to google
<JackiePie> Interesting, so when will this new Toonami start streams?
<Lvs> and never was popular to begin with
<Luna> 07he's in pain..
<Wrek> 05herospirit wins
<CrimsonFoxx> I especially think it's cool how much they worked to make it look like Toonami even though it's a fan made action block.
<Lvs> but it's really a great game, and incrtedibly fun with ponies
<herospirit> :D
<Gilda> Sounds about right, yeah.
<MrMooMoo> Is it on CN?
<Luna> 07the cut is a distraction for his pains
<JackiePie> I always liked how the cricket on Space Ghost kept getting zapped.
<Fluttershy> withdrawal
<CrimsonFoxx> No, it's a fan project that will be showing over livestream.
<Charlie_Horse> Zorak?
<JackiePie> Yes
<JackiePie> lol
<DecapKing> 4im not a huge fan of griffions, the can get angry really easily, also they have the same mate for life......
<Pinkamena_Diane_Pie> does Sethisto tend to come in here at all?
<MrMooMoo> Oh.
<Fluttershy> I've seen my older brother go through it :<
<JackiePie> He was always getting zapped
<MrMooMoo> Nope.
<maxaminus> http://www.neotoonami.com/Schedule.html
<Mason_Trowel> Not really
<dashie> oh my, that's terrible D:
<Mason_Trowel> He was here for the Mane 6 event
<Pinkie_Pie> I have returned
<Pinkamena_Diane_Pie> fair enough - back to plan A
<maxaminus> Starts the 9th I guess
<Lvs> http://i56.tinypic.com/1ppk.jpg
<GGgala> They must have a naturally high tolerance for boredom, then.
<Lvs> http://i52.tinypic.com/2ciadme.jpg
<Mason_Trowel> But that was pretty much it
<CrimsonFoxx> The computer animation for Tom and everything else is so good that it looks like the official Toonami did though.

<MrMooMoo> I gotta do my personal statment for college...
<MrMooMoo> And no its hasbro
<DecapKing> 4well the griffon i dated was a complete bitch....
<MrMooMoo> Hub is also hasbro.
<dashie> house is a kind of a bitch sometimes
<CrimsonFoxx> I think he's asking because Lauren Faust worked on several shows that were on Cartoon Network.
<JackiePie> Crimson well when Toonami was created, the technology for designing characters like Tom wasn't widely available, now it is.
<Wrek> 05he earned the right to be

<JackiePie> Depends on if you like Anime or not
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Yogcast on the Secret Diablo Pony Level (http://tinyurl.com/4xgva95)
<CrimsonFoxx> I've seen the subbed version of that anime before, it's actually pretty funny.
<Mason_Trowel> Dameshitte! PPGZ Isn't bad, per se. But it is certainly different from its source material
<^Stargazer> no, I asked because I heard there were talks but nothing official kicked in
<^Stargazer> lol, I just watched to Yogcast video on that
<CrimsonFoxx> I'm looking forward to finally seeing the English dub.
<Silvermane> yogcast?
<HaysforPonies> Oh yay, Yogcast
<Pegacorn> How's everypony going?
<Luna> 07WAT!
<maxaminus> Yogscast? on what now?
<^Stargazer> Yogcast is funny
<WhatPayne> fine
<herospirit> I'm back. My mother seems... pretty much cool with her broken toe.
<Pegacorn> OHSHI-,IT'S YOGCAST
<Wrek> 05oh yeah jsut saw that
<Wrek> 05was hilarious

<Pegacorn> IS NOT POSSIBLE
<herospirit> Yah. My family gets injured a lot. :0
<maxaminus> oh derp its on the front page
<Boombox> ...? ...*
<^Stargazer> friends introduced me into them playing coop in a coop gamem with wizards. Magicka lol
<Silvermane> 15intriguing
<Sumica> bleeding from all holes again.
<herospirit> She's more upset about the money it'll take for the medical though.
<^Stargazer> "I'm casting a heeeeealing spell" lol
*^Stargazer laughs
<dashie> oh buu
<Pinkie_Pie> =/
<Nittany_Tiger> Insurance fun?
<Pinkie_Pie> How much would it cost?
<Silvermane> all of it
<Leika> Why did I just picture you saying that with Steven Magnet's voice?
<Silvermane> it would cost all of it
<herospirit> I dunno how much. Do you live in America? :0
<Wrek> 05gah more lupus!
<AllisZero> My mom is just like that herospirit
<dashie> my dad is a doctor, does that count?
<Pegacorn> HUGE Lupus
<Nittany_Tiger> When I had my kidney stones, my insurance decided to have fun with me.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Hey guys. What's going on in this chat?
<herospirit> Medical cost in America is pretty stupid.
<Deviljho> Because Steven Magnet is best... Magnet.
<ShadTheCrazed> http://snowbals.deviantart.com/art/Chibi-Gilda-256918492
<herospirit> And that doesn't sound good Nittany :0
<ShadTheCrazed> Steven Magnet is best serpent.
<Deviljho> We have other serpents?
<Lvs> is that the biggest head ever?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah. They hurt a lot, and I only had tiny ones.
<herospirit> :P
<Steven_Magnet> It's SOOOOO true!!!
<DecapKing> 4talking about stuff
<Nittany_Tiger> But it's 10/10 pain.
<Ziltoid> IDEA
<herospirit> I've never had kidney stones.
<Nittany_Tiger> Good.
<Deviljho> Wait! Come back Steven! ='(
<InsertCupcake> lol willpower
<FallSilently> wut
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11... ' ^ '
<JackiePie> Whoa! Wildfires in Texas!
<Silvermane> 15random shipping and sex talk
<DecapKing> 4like how there is a griffon stalking me
<Nittany_Tiger> My mom had a large one that she had to get surgically removed.
<herospirit> Mammy says she's going to get an X-Ray. She's hoping it's just dislocated. Ima help look for crutches.
<alphaJackal> Yeah, happens sometimes
<Charlie_Horse> Yeah...
<ShadTheCrazed> What a world! WHat a world!!!
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Oh my. Sounds serious.
<dashie> i hope it's just dislocated
<DecapKing> 4yeah, that Gilda was a bitch
<alphaJackal> Complements of a really hot summer in a really hot state
<Nittany_Tiger> Broken or dislocated, it'll still be a doctor's visit.
<Deviljho> I'm trying grow a mustache like Steven Magnet.
<Nittany_Tiger> They'll splint it either way.
<alphaJackal> but the temp is going down lately, so should be fine
<Nittany_Tiger> Well...
<Sumica> grabben pills
<JackiePie> Good
<alphaJackal> Nothing like a solid month of 100+ degree weather to make you love winter even more
<DecapKing> 4and completely insane
<ShadTheCrazed> Indeed.
<JackiePie> I hope it gets cool here soon, so I can get back to complaining that it's not warm enough.
<dashie> that was funny
<JackiePie> LoL, I'm always like that.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11So, Boombox tells me that the little shipping I attempted wasn't that horrible? Any merit to this?
<ShadTheCrazed> For halloween, I wanna try to make something like the CMC costume, only better.
<alphaJackal> Why would anyone ever complain about being cold? Cold is awesome.
<Lvs> everyone's like that
<Charlie_Horse> It's easier to keep warm in the cold than to keep cool when it's hot.
<Lvs> more or less
<JackiePie> I love the change of weather, but after awhile you miss the opposite of the weather you're currently in.
<DecapKing> 4how do you understand that?
<RobotPinkie> Wow...
<Sumica> lol nice
<dashie> now that was rude
<FreezeFrame> House: Dick to little kids
<Sumica> love the waiting in line bit
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11... ...~ ... ... ...? ... ... ...*
<Pegacorn> IS NOT POSSIBLE
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11That's how.
<alphaJackal> It's funny. Lived in Texas all my life, and i still can't get used to the heat
<Silvermane> 15it had potential. even if trixie is supposed to be preoccupied straddling me in Tink's room
<FreezeFrame> And to little people.
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Wrek> 05"higher than you"
<Sumica> "higher then you"
<Pinkie_Pie> Eh?
<Sumica> HA
<Dashite> `\Higher than you.
<Wrek> 05beat you to it Sumica
<Sumica> Not on my end
<Dashite> Wrek wins on my end.
<Pinkie_Pie> Im still not if I should redownload the MLP episodes
<DecapKing> 4so, im supposed to be passed out somewhere
<dash> in 15 minutes i'm leaving for baseball practise
<InsertCupcake> Wrek wins
<dash> practice
<Deviljho> I love cold weather. Too bad I'm in a place that gets up to 100 degrees.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11...What?
<Dashite> I'm still better than both of you though because I capitalized and used punctuation.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Do you need help doing that or something...?
<Lvs> i like cold weather, too
<Dashite> And did it all one handed.
<KershaFangs> I hate the cold
<herospirit> And now I'm back.
<Lvs> but everyone around me gets terribly depressed by it
<RobotPinkie> d'aww
*Silvermane 15hits Decapking over the head with a bottle.
<Sumica> was't the right punctuation though
<Charlie_Horse> It's 100 degrees outside my place right now.
<Lvs> so i always feel guilty about enjoying that kind of weather.
<Wrek> 05then again da-shite, im better than you, because I am.
*Silvermane 15It bounces off as it is plastic
<DecapKing> 4nah, id rather just stay awake
<KershaFangs> If it's below 70, I start to shiver
<Wrek> 05oh them silly reasoning
<dash> i'm going to my frist practice for agoura hills! this is my 4th year of baseball and the temperature is going to be 102 degrees..... FUCK
<Dashite> Eeenope. :p
<RobotPinkie> so just one more House ep today?
<Dashite> I think this is #3
<dash> I play all stars by the way
<dash> once
<dashie> yeah, I think so...
<Ziltoid> NOOOOOOOO
<RobotPinkie> oh.... really?
<dash> wish me luck with new people
<JackiePie> luck
<Lvs> good luck!
<Dashite> Dashie and Dashite...
<Ziltoid> i wanna see what happens with the deal
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Well, it does sound imperative that you not be conscious. So the only responsible thing to do would be to knock you out and toss you in a ditch.
<MrMooMoo> !luck
<dash> i use to play for foothill
<Sumica> You are better cause you can kick me =p
<alphaJackal> Yeah, after that month of solid 100+ degree weather...i actually found 80 degrees to be really chilly
<dash> they had some best teams
<Deviljho> Break a le- Uh, good luck!
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Because it's the right thing to do.
<Ziltoid> dawwww
<Silvermane> 15I like this plan
<dash> i got in all stars last year!
<VioletVanilla> 6Dashie and Dashite!! <3
<Dashite> That doesn't make him better than you. :p
<dash> 1st time
<dash> 3rd year
<dashie> he doesn't take the deal
<Wrek> 05I'd never kick you Sumica
<dash> i'm always on the best teams
<Wrek> 05!
<FreezeFrame> And horrible ideas.
<johnsey> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/55016
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about he-man artist:johnjoseco sea_pony prince_adam Lyra (and 3 more)
<Dashite> He tries.
<Lvs> i don't know what that means... it's probably good?
<DecapKing> 4i only say that because i think that DE tried to spike my drink again, just to dump me in the middle of town
<FreezeFrame> Mixing Vicodin and alcohol
<dash> â Single. â Taken. â Married to a Pegasus that doesn't actually exist.
<herospirit> Did House just down that bottle? :0
<dash> YES
<RobotPinkie> oh well, that's life
<FreezeFrame> He mixed vicodin with it
<Ziltoid> OH FUCK
<FreezeFrame> Vicodin with one drink will fuck you up
<RainbowDash> Okay.
<FreezeFrame> oh, oxy
<FreezeFrame> Not vicodin.
<Sumica> I know Wrek, just being a jackass.
<MrMooMoo> Okay.
<dash> hey mom
<FreezeFrame> Even worse.
<Silvermane> Oxycodone, my god
<InsertCupcake> it was oxicodone
<RobotPinkie> oh wow
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Now, I was thinking of using Boombox to flatten your head. Mostly because he's mostly solid steel. But I'm open for suggestions.
<Sumica> wake and bake house
<JackiePie> roflol, someone tried to rob a convenience store in a Gumby mascot costume
<dash> lul wut?
<Charlie_Horse> How would that work?
<RainbowDash> Me too.
<FreezeFrame> Now he's even more of a jackass, because he left House alone to potentially die.
<DecapKing> 4im in only if it ends like it did last night
<Silvermane> 15You could... i dunno, maybe... continue your trixie story?
<RainbowDash> That was probably me.
<RobotPinkie> see THIS is why this guy deserves to burn in hell for all eternity...
<dash> i robbed a bank when i was gusta once
<Dashite> Dammit FreezeFrame, he's an oncologist, not a doctor!
<Unidentified42272> What just happened?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Oh, well...
<dashie> yeah
<Dashite> >_>

<ShadTheCrazed> Hmm... Though my power of forcing unkown ponies on everyone, I can get my school band to play the Apple Jack theme from MLP: Fighting is Magic!
<herospirit> No it's 6 P.M.

*FallSilently pats Owloysius' head.

<FreezeFrame> His shows don't distract me, since I can't understand them, but the other way around does. (He watches a bunch of Chinese shows)

<WhatPayne> I don't care about Diablo at all
<prince-dari> Never played any of the games.
<Narrator> 9Boombox, unable to really do anything to argue against the blue mare, allowed her to lower him to a very close tree stump. She sat herself next to the stump, facing what Boombox could only guess was a... Pile of ashes, of all things. With some telekinesis and controlled pyrotechnics, the pile was quickly replaced by a campfire.
<dashie> im not
<FreezeFrame> You aren't
<DecapKing> im not
<prince-dari> Don't care about the release.

<Silvermane> The Mighty and Magnificent Silvermane disagrees with these silly white-backed text moderators
<prince-dari> Woop.
<FallSilently> I don't really RP with them, but I like to write and this helps me get inside the head of a different personality.

<herospirit> Simon is Best Dwarf
<Spin> Hi
<^Stargazer> I'm tempetd to shoot for that dead island game, the bugs are kind of keeping me back though lol
<Narrator> 9"That's a pity..." Trixie muttered back to the crackling fire. Her belly rumbled and she groaned. "As if my life isn't hard enough, I've got a mystery box that talks in a language I can't understand." Trixie huffed, obviously frustrated with the situation. But her sagging shoulders betrayed her true feelings.
<dashie> agreed
<Spin> Marksmanship Competition?
<prince-dari> I don't usually listen to these kinds of things.
<Dashite> DLC purchased through the REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE.
<RobotPinkie> i dunno, what about Gimli?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they need to go back to the ponies
<Wrek> 05...but when I do, i take in every single word
<prince-dari> I could talk to myself or a friend for something similar.
*Fluttershy is eating chocolate covered coffee beans~
<WhatPayne> Usually dev podcasts are boring. This is not.
<Silvermane> ooooo
<Dashite> Normally they play games rather than just show random pictures.
<WhatPayne> Only podcast I really like listening in Bungie podcast.
<FallSilently> Hey again Summer
<herospirit> I believe thy are most famous for their Minecraft playthrough. Their friends pose as NPCs and give it a storyline.
<dashie> don't do drugs kids
<RobotPinkie> best podcast is The Bugle...
<Dashite> Don't do kids drugs.
<SummerRain> heyo
<Spin> Get it cause you said shoot haha.. ha.. I'll be quiet now
<dashie> lol
<prince-dari> Minecraft has to be the most pointless game ever.
<prince-dari> Is it actually a game?
<Silvermane> 'Don't do drugs kids. You can't afford it on your incomes.
<Sumica> and stop
<^Stargazer> hihi
<DesertRose> hello
<dashie> I'v never played it
<DecapKing> i can SilverMane
<WhatPayne> I've never understood Minecraft
<Wrek> 05fumblemore
<Dashite> Is it a game? No. It's a lego set.
<DashingRainbow> PONIES IS FOR LITTLE GIRLS
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I wouldn't really call it a game honestly
<Silvermane> well then go right ahead decapking
<herospirit> It's fun. But it doesn't really have a point.
<RobotPinkie> lol trollan again
<Silvermane> valthejean, you don't call anything a game
<Narrator> 9Boombox had seen that before. Not on her, but on plenty of ponies. He had an idea. "!!!*" He screeched, shocking Trixie out of her self-pity filled monologue.
<DesertRose> then i am the strangest little girl ever
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's like...photoshop with game elements you can choose to enable (which no one does)
<Dashite> Wat?
<dashie> the only cool thing about it is that people do pixel art with it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good god Silvermane get over it. I don't like Durrgarr, cry more
<Fluttershy> I'm super excited for Skyward Sword >w<
<Dashite> Minecraft is totally a lego set, not Photoshop.
<herospirit> It's like the best Lego set in the world
<Sidestroke> Ponies *are* for little girls, yes.

<Pinkie_Pie> It hurts, doesnt it Prince-Dari?
*^Stargazer is a pony, and is also a boy... you're logic is flawed!

<herospirit> What post Mister Doctor Professor Seargent, Sir?
<prince-dari> WOAH
<RobotPinkie> I'm looking forward to the 1.8 update
<Sidestroke> Stargazer, your logic is flawed too. If you're a pony, then you're a colt! xP
<prince-dari> If you stare at that gif and don't blink for about 30 seconds.
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> the pony episode
<prince-dari> Then look around, stuff warps all over the damn place.
<FallSilently> Don't worry, this place has HUGE, MUSCLEY moderators to deal with trolls.

<^Stargazer> how am I wrong lol
<MrDrProfSgtBrony> he is a pony hater
<DesertRose> inb4 Cutie Mark Crusaders ask luna/celestia how they got their cutie mark
<RobotPinkie> the most boring thing about Minecraft is that if you make something in 1.3, it's broken in 1.4 and so on....
<SummerRain> XD
<FluffyWuffs> HERRO PONIES
<^Stargazer> lol
<FluffyWuffs> long day of school
<Solo> FallSilently: And aggravating sarcastic chatters to harass them as well.
<FallSilently> That would literally be how Equestria was made.
<KershaFangs> My mother has a weird sense of humor.
<DashingRainbow> I LOVE PONIES
<^Stargazer> I hope they get slapped if they ask that
<DesertRose> :D

<WhatPayne> Thank you Luna
<Narrator> 9Trixie nearly jumped out of her skin, wide eyed and frizzy maned. She blinked a couple of times and waited for her heart to stop running so fast before hissing, "What is your problem, box!?" She sat back up and trotted to stare Boombox straight in the eye. Seeing none, she settled for his display LCD. "You could have scared Trixie to death!"
<Wrek> 05aye, tanks for an awesoem session as always, /hug!

<Shaico> What could this be...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 gnight robotpinkie
<Narrator> 9Instead of beeping or dinging as Boombox would reply to most anypony, whether they could understand him or not. Instead, he presented a song on his display, but didn't play it.
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh gawd
<Pinkie_Pie> http://img.ponibooru.org/images/02/02090d8421001468850bb39642e22ac2

<KershaFangs> Best sickness ever. It feeds me.
<dashie> lol xD
<SummerRain> Beau?
<Solo> I'm convinced that Applebloom's cutie mark is going to be a question mark.
<Solo> From all the crusading, she's good at everything.
<DesertRose> glowy blue thing......
<dashie> pinkie_pie WIN
<SummerRain> Shaico!
<Fluttershy> @Pinkie_Pie oh dear

<Dashite> @roll 20
<Pinkie_Pie> Fluttershy, dont you want to be a tree?
<Charlie_Horse> Heh.
<Dashite> Damn you Steven
<Dashite> !
<Pinkie_Pie> A tree with a big axe
<Shaico> Baboon?
*Wrek waves at everypony, good night!
<dashie> good night
<Narrator> 9Trixie, being right in Boombox's (technically speaking) face, noticed the white glow and black text immediately. She narrowed her eyes, not used to reading from digital screens. "Positive Qualities?" She stood upright, haven forgotten her frustration. "What is that supposed to mean?"
<KershaFangs> He has a million petnames for me, I just have Beau for him, but he likes it.
<Fluttershy> @Pinkie_Pie I don't know about that tree... it's scary >_<

<herospirit> Gute Nacht, vielen gute Traumen
<Luna> 07bis spÃ¤ter
<Narrator> 9All thoughts left Trixie as the hypnotic beat emanating from the boom box filled her head.
<cocoaa> -lonely-
<Deviljho> My girlfriend calls me... Wait, what girlfriend?
<cocoaa> ???
<WhatPayne> Well I'll say that in Finnish too: HyvÃ¤Ã¤ yÃ¶tÃ¤ BMN!

<JackiePie> I dunno
<Shaico> I wouldn't call it spoilers...
<Shaico> Just huge teasers.
<Sumica> Yeah sorry was taking over the univers again.
<Narrator> 9It was a success, from where Boombox was sitting. He quietly watched as Trixie, now happy as can be danced to the steady beat and rhythm of the song. He was content, with himself.
<Ziltoid> huh?
<Ziltoid> What are you gonna stream then?
<JackiePie> I saw they used a baby doll in an ad for Bounty Towels.
<HaysforPonies> I'm trying to avoid the front page of things from now on sides Drawfriend and Night Roundup. I would like to be surprised for S2
<JackiePie> I was thinking, "Please don't tell me they're using those creepy Reborn dolls in ads now!"
<herospirit> She's going to set "Friday" on repeat
<Charlie_Horse> Oh dear. XD
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJNmJ5DJm-s

<JackiePie> I'm pretty sure it was your standard toy doll.
*FluffyWuffs glares at JackiePie...
<JackiePie> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> Sky is a really cool color outside.
<Shaico> Ho boy once S2 episode is out, I have to avoid going on EqD.
<JackiePie> Wait
<herospirit> YYESH
<JackiePie> Uh oh
*Silvermane MFW TAKEI from Star Trek is Rainbow Dash's Dad
*JackiePie runs
<Shaico> And I must wait for the episode on Youtube...

<Shaico> ... It's 6:30 and the chatroom is dead, how is this even possible?
<Sumica> nah 10hours of inception horn
<JackiePie> split?
<HaysforPonies> Cause coffee.
<Daisymare> Unless the series starts making episodes that connect a continous arch I see no reason to avoid spoilers.
<ShadTheCrazed> Maybe it'll be like, an hour before the episode is uploaded once the S2 episode comes out.
<JackiePie> You will never find me on the moon Fluffy!
<JackiePie> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, JackiePie!
<Pinkie_Pie> Do you want Sea Ponies on repeat Val?
<Silvermane> DeacpKing, my thoughts exactly

<Fluttershy> ï¼ï¼
<herospirit> I listen toos it
*FluffyWuffs changes targets, he glares at SummerRain
<SummerRain> D:
<SummerRain> wat did I do?
<FluffyWuffs> ;_;
<Daisymare> What I want to see is an offical MLP series based on top rated Fanfics. Not a canon series but more like Tales From Crypt. Just a bunch of one shots that make use of the talent.
<Deviljho> So how do I do that italicized text? I'm such a noob. =<

<JackiePie> alright dinner, bbl
<Spin> I loved that
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate that some of those characters won't show on my laptop. They get replaced with hex boxes.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh this is burn notice
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11(yfw I was contemplating that option)
<Sumica> indeed
<FluffyWuffs> Just saw that comic on EqD
<FluffyWuffs> i laffed
<Spin> Derpy one was good too.
<DecapKing> Burn Notice ÑÐ¹!
<Colson> laffed
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I watched like...the first 5 or 6 episodes...but I never finished it
<Spin> laffed
<FluffyWuffs> eeyup
<Sumica> I has it all
<Spin> Okie Dokie Lokie
<Daisymare> I had no idea Applejack was a mob boss.
<Fluttershy> ãã©ã¿ã·ã£ã¤æããããã­ãï¼
<FluffyWuffs> AJ runs the apple trade
<Spin> How? Its clearly stated in the show.
<Ziltoid> DAT PROMOTING
<Spin> C'mon all that land
<Daisymare> Applebloom's her inforcer?
<Fluttershy> what is this? o-o
<Sidestroke> That pear pony... Gah, so cute.
<Blott> granny smith is totally the godfather equivalent
<Dashite> Aw yeah! Burn Notice!
<Sumica> Burn notice, they are testing me out now =p
<SummerRain> ^
<Sidestroke> I like his/her (honestly can't tell) tussled mane and hat x3
<Daisymare> Somepony make that fanfic!
<Dashite> Quality looks great!
<Spin> You come to me on the day of Applebuck season. And this is what you ask of me?
<Narrator> 9"Right..." Trixie replied. "Trixie feels like she's going insane when she talks to you... When you just... Beep." Trixie clammed up after that, not saying much else. Boombox didn't care for the silence very much, being what he is, but there was nothing he could do about it.
<Sumica> I dont have your cute voice though Fluttershy So i wont be talking =p
<Sidestroke> Actually, looks a like a female on second inspection. Eyelashes. But still pretty darn cute~
<CogWeaver> it is a mare
<Daisymare> I would so read a GodPony parody.
<Fluttershy> hum? o-o
<Sumica> Thanks Dashite
*Spin considers its.
<CogWeaver> I think there was one...a long while back...I think...
<Spin> *it
<FluffyWuffs> I agree with Blott
<CogWeaver> it didn't have anything to do with AJ though
<Daisymare> Was it about the Apple family?
<FluffyWuffs> and AJ IS scarface
<Sumica> And title drop
<Narrator> 9So they sat in bored, quiet silence for an hour (57 minutes according to Boombox's internal clock) before Trixie spoke again. Boombox tore himself away from his e-book and listened.
*Sumica wonders how far off the stream is from the feed
<Spin> Whats Applebloom?
<Daisymare> Well then! Do an Apple family version of the GodPony.
<Dashite> inb4 beating
<HaysforPonies> Snorting her face all over apple cinnamon?
<Daisymare> she's the enforcer
<HoneyWhistle> How about a Honey family?
<Fluttershy> @Sumica You're talking too? Huh?
<FluffyWuffs> ^make it happen!

<Daisymare> I had to go OC cause the mane characters couldn't do my story.
<redd> hey fluffywuffy
<Shaico> Yeah but the last time he did that he got his friend to ask why I'm ignoring him.
<Spin> Ignore his friend
<Shaico> Dammit, I don't want to make the guy feel bad, but there's not one day where he won't leave me alone.
<Silvermane> so... we are watching Burn Notice?
<Dashite> Yes

*SummerRain|Lawl_Queen procrastinate
<Dashite> What kind of beans?
<Fluttershy> I mean
<Narrator> 9"It's getting late..." She muttered. She looked at him with a nervous smile. "Trixie supposes you will be going home?" She was nervous, and he could tell. But about what, he couldn't be sure. So he just beeped. Trixie nodded. "Right, um... Is that a yes?" He noticed her excitement build after she said this. Something bad may happen if he said no.
<Fluttershy> coffee beans
<Narrator> 9If he could say no.
<Dashite> Yes
<Fluttershy> >< chocolate covered coffee beans

<Deviljho> I forget. What's a girl?
<Narrator> 9Trixie took a deep breath, settling her nerves /just/ slightly. "One beep for yes, two for no, okay?"
<Pinkie_Pie> Why so sure..?
<Fluttershy> I love the chocolate covered coffee beans but they make me super hyper and the crash is always horibble e-e
<Fluttershy> horrible*

<johnsey> Deviljho: a bit like a mare
<Spin> The thing you pretend your hand is.
<Shaico> Deviljho: Boobies.
<redd1> hooray
<ShadTheCrazed> I can use my Brony powers to convert nearly everyone in the 8th grade into a Brony if I just had the time and if they would listen and not be close-minded.

<Shaico> No Colgate was here and I didn't know!?
<Narrator> 9Trixie nodded, working her happy act again and smiling. "So, are you going home now?"
<redd> YES
<Shaico> Horseappls!
<ShadTheCrazed> And that's the reason why I'm not spreading Ponies via facebook.
<Pinkie_Pie> I guess you could eat them a few hours before bed, and then would sleep good
<redd> HOORAY

<Spin> Maybe we can convince its the cool kid thing. Just have bronies flood their freinds list and post Ponies all day.
<Shaico> Delicious!
<Dashite> Pinkie_Pie doesn't need caffiene as well.

<Shaico> The more MLP spreads, the more will like it.
<redd> poke poke
<Dashite> I love the advice he gives. :)
<Charlie_Horse> True.
<Shaico> Hell it's already gotten Top Gear.
<Spin> True, but wouldn't hurt to take things in our own hooves.
<Charlie_Horse> It has? :o
<Shaico> They would think that we're being a bit too annoying don'tcha think?
<Dermathil> >
<Shaico> And excuse me for a moment.
<Spin> Good point maybe slow and subtle is best.
*Shaico glomps Colgate!
<atomic7732> Not like anyone uses Facebook for anything useful anyway :P

<Dermathil> >mfw I see the YOGSCAST making a video about the Diablo 3 secret level (and Sethisto saying one of them is secretly brony. He's not actually secret, he's made another video about ponies before...)
<Pinkie_Pie> What do you mean I dont get enough sugar?
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<Shaico> I used to update my wall all the time.
<Narrator> 9Boombox, for the first time in his short emulated life, felt nervous. On one hoof, he needed to get home, on the other... Trixie was obviously lonely. It was one of those times that he wished having 'Make ponies happy and obey Razyn' as his prime directive so difficult. He remained silent, so silent, trying his very hardest to decide his answer.
<Spin> Ya My facebook friends list consists of family members ex-GFs and old friends that don't even remember me
<Plorf> Plorf
<Pinkie_Pie> Err
<Colgate> ohey, I DCd apparently
<Spin> Plorf!
<Plorf> Oh, we're talking about Facebook?
<Pinkie_Pie> That I get enough sugar*
*Plorf uses that FAR too often
<Spin> Yep
<herospirit> Lol, this is hilarious
<Shaico> You're back, and that's all that matters!
<Nittany_Tiger> Do your pancreas produce excess insulin?
<Plorf> :3

*Shaico gives kisses to Colgate. "Shame I have to be going so soon."
<Nittany_Tiger> If you crave a lot of sugar, that would be why.
<Plorf> neckbeard tag
<Plorf> the best tag

<Spin> INTERNET Y U NO LOAD!
<Nittany_Tiger> Low blood sugar.
<Fluttershy> I think I'm hypoglycemic e-e;
<roushguy> There already is one. It currently involves the playing of tag... but that ought to change soon.
*Pinkie_Pie shrugs
<^Stargazer> ug, two more days and then I get a week off from work lol
<Shaico> Hopefully if I don't get too busy. >.<

<roushguy> I'm trying to decide if I should set the first episode of season two to record...
<Deviljho> I'm gonna go. I need to stalk stuff.
<Spin> I'm seriously considering either A) Finishing my Paper-shy Fic or B) GodPony fic.
<herospirit> Are you the streamer Sumi? :0
<roushguy> But I am, for the time being, a closet brony.
<Sumica> yah
<Shaico> I need someone to ask to record the episode and send it to me so I can get it as early as possible...
<Barry> Hallo

<Spin> By Shaico.
<Narrator> 9Trixie was silent for a moment. But then she was on her hooves bouncing around Boombox and his stump while saying "yes" over and over. She only made one revolution before she realized how silly she was being and sat down with a quick apology.
<Colgate> cya
<Blums> its not like mlp has tonnes of fine details that you have to had 44mm quality to see
<Spin> *bye
<Barry> I can't understand you

<johnsey> Colgate: and why are you not running your irc client in a screen?
<herospirit> Wat

<Mongoose> Hello
<johnsey> like all sane people do
<herospirit> What are you speaking Decap? :0
<Barry> now, what did you say?
<Narrator> 9Boombox internally sighed. He was glad that she was happy, but he also wondered what he got himself into.
<SummerRain|Lawl_Queen> letttsss discuss KINDLE
*^Stargazer cannot resist a hug
<DecapKing> ÑÐ¸
<Sumica> it's russan
<Spin> I hate that I constantly out words.
<SummerRain|Lawl_Queen> do you guys like it? or do you prefer regular old books?

<ShadTheCrazed> I think I'll bring that picture of Obama holding a Twilight Sparkle toy to school one day, and replace the current picture of Obama with that.
<Colgate> johnsey: because I'm using xchat, I can't devote a whole screen to irc
<Charlie_Horse> So happy, eve.
<Barry> Serbian?
<DecapKing> ÐÐ° ÑÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸
<Barry> ok.
<Dashite> Serbian according to google.
<Barry> hm
<Colgate> and switching between chats is easier in xchat than switching them in terminal
<johnsey> "a whole screen"?

<Nashy> terminal D:
<Colson> Squee!
<Spin> Computer is too slow to run Firefox.. I have a REALLY bad Laptop
<Colson> terminals are fun!
<Dashite> Fun to be annoying and speak in a language that other people need to translate first. :p
<ShadTheCrazed> Or maybe do a project of Obama and have that picture in there.
<Colgate> terminals are awesome
<Colson> Colgate, what are you running
<johnsey> (and i'm still sure then pressing alt+number is faster than clicking :D)
<Nashy> terminal cancer
<Colson> ?
<Barry> just go to translation and choose english for translating them to
<Colgate> arch linux
<DecapKing> ÐÐ°, ÑÐ°ÑÐ½Ð¾
<Silvermane> you can turn on translation: Into English

<Pinkie_Pie> Decap...
<roushguy> The real question is how to present my obsession to my family. They already think I'm nuts....
<Colson> I'm running Ubuntu for now until my MacBook Pro arrives, then I'll probably virtualize Arch
<Rainbow_crash717> Hello Every Pony
<Colgate> johnsey: well, yes, but I just don't want to run a whole screen devoted to irc

<djb123> hi crash
<Narrator> 9"Well, if that's the case, it's off to bed for Trixie." Trixie, smiling as bright as the moon, quickly extinguished the fire with some nearby dirt. She turned to Boombox. "Do you want to come in?"
<Pinkie_Pie> YOU FOAL, SPEAK ENGLISH
<Colgate> and when the terminal gets sized down, the text runs off
<Rainbow_crash717> Hiii

<herospirit> Translator doesn't work well.
<DecapKing> ÐÐ Ð·Ð°Ð±Ð°Ð²ÑÐ°
<Barry> I agree
<mib_2p79qp> Just wondering, will this place have a live stream of season 2?
<herospirit> It tries to translate Decap from Macedonian when he's speaking Serbian : /
<roushguy> There's a difference between acting like Pinkie Pie in real life
<johnsey> i can resize my terminal whatever whay i want and irssi adapts
<Silvermane> yes we will, anon
<Spin> Damn rebellious text. Doesn't know how cruel the world is to unsupervised text.

<Colgate> I'm in ~15 channels
<Barry> Translations are fun to do, but it soon gets exhausting trying to figure out what you're saying
<Spin> Dude what?
<FallSilently> See yah, Summer!
<redd> CRAP
<Colson> .
<johnsey> that's more than enough, if you have more than 3 _active_ chats, you can't follow them all parallely anyway
<redd> GET OFF THE CHANNEL
<Colson> yeah
<johnsey> and if they're not active, you can just meta+a
<Rainbow_crash717> FOREAVER FOREAVER FOREAVER FOREAVER FOREAVER

*Pinkie_Pie slaps DecapKing
<Nashy> Quick, get back to the ship!
<redd> Spin, what do you mean, inbreed?
<Spin> We preach love and tolerance who said anything about ..*Blegh* Forgiveness
<redd> im doing nothing of the sort?
<IAmNotAGoat> Forgiveness is not one of the elements of harmony, and is thus irrelevent
<johnsey> show last active window is actually something you use after taking a look at the other channel heh
<Pinkie_Pie> Also, that was english
<Barry> I don't like coffee, so I doubt I'd like the bean
*Fluttershy yelps and jumps back from the sound of the slap.
<DecapKing> why did you slap me?

*Pinkie_Pie shrugs
<DecapKing> and you scared fluttershy
<redd> i meant that not in a naughty way
<Rainbow_crash717> How smell you Sis

<Nashy> Derpy, the element of forgiveness. She has no long term memory.
<Pinkie_Pie> I figured more Caffeine was bad
<Fluttershy> This show is kind of trippy right now... hehe... e_E;
*Silvermane shushes Fluttershy, trying to calm her. "It's okay, shy-shy."

<Pinkie_Pie> Sorry Fluttershy.. :o

<Blums> maybe his/her sister has a miasma of perfume?
<Spin> *bre
<Rainbow_crash717> oh
<redd> she can smell my blood from a mile away
<Colgate> johnsey: maybe if there was a way to have a summary list at the top with how many missed messages I had in every channel
*Fluttershy lays down, closing her eyes. "That's a new nickname..." o-o
<Silvermane> sorry, i give pet-names to fillies quite often
<djb123> are you a shark?
<redd> and i can smell her blood from two miles
<Barry> It's a pet name
<Sumica> Cute nickname
<Nashy> Are you a spy?
<redd> yes, i am a shark
<Colgate> that would make it work
<Spin> SUCK MY DICK!!
<Rainbow_crash717> Sharck are Cute
<Barry> damn, ninja'd AGAIN!
<Pinkie_Pie> I know, it just kinda made me grin
<DecapKing> what? isnt the answer to a caffeine crash more caffeine?
<djb123> that explains it
<redd> im afraid not
<Spin> IM A SHARK!
<Colson> no u
<Barry> no. The answer to a caffeine crash is rest

<Fluttershy> Oh, thank you Silvermane... ^^

<johnsey> well, for irssi at least but i reckon there should be for weechat as well
<herospirit> Hammer Time
<Barry> a pocket dimension that has everything
<Sidestroke> Also, IAmNotAGoat, if this were TF2, nopony's stopping you sadly. xP
<Silvermane> the place where giant hammers come from despite the size of pockets in shows
<Spin> Redd is okay I hold you *hugs Redd impaling himself* Welp that didn't work out as planned

<Plorf> Teamwork is magic.

<FallSilently> Sorry, I was on facebook. I just looked in.

<Dashite> OHAI OCTAVIA!
<JackiePie> I just came back in, and suddenly, spam
<Octavia> Hey Dashite
<IAmNotAGoat> My little portal is pretty magic....al
<IAmNotAGoat> oh grammar
<Sumica> Hi Octavia
<Octavia> 13Hey Sumica
<Silvermane> Hello 6th best pony, Octavia
<DecapKing> 4(DecapKing wears the hat he has from his days in Stalliongrad)
<Octavia> 13 6th?! D:
<DecapKing> hey Octavia
<Spin> Anyone wanna share embarassing pony moments?
*DecapKing glomps Octavia
<Octavia> 13Hey misguided SilverMane <3
<Silvermane> Sorry, but you are the most outright beautiful pony at the least, Octavia
<Silvermane> <3
<Spin> I'll go first
<Octavia> 13Hey Decap :P
<thunder-colt> me
<Colson> sure.
*Octavia 13is glomped on X3
<IAmNotAGoat> I'm game
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11(Well, it seems everypony here has an accessory or two!)
<DecapKing> Octavia=my favorite pony
<roushguy> I read Bittersweet yesterday and spent all day today moping and crying
<Luna> 07hey!
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11(inb4 you think Boombox is an accessory)
*Luna sobs in a corner
<Octavia> 13Hey Luna :P
<Octavia> 13:(
<Narrator> 9In mere seconds, Boombox found himself on a bed next to the blue mare, very confused how it happened, and very /very/ curious as to why he was being held. Before he could beep an objection, the blue mare nuzzled him "Goodnight, Boombox." Her flat, sleepy tone struck a chord with him.
<Plorf> I have zero embarassing pony moments
*Octavia 13goes to corner and hugs Luna
<Luna> 07foreveralone.jpg
<Plorf> to be perfectly honest
<Octavia> 13lol
<Sumica> I would glomp too but I dont want to get bludgeoned with a doublebass
<Octavia> 13Nup
<HaysforPonies> Neither do I
*Octavia 13comforts Luna
<DecapKing> 4(also i have a pair of saddlebags to carry my vodka in)
<IAmNotAGoat> I don't have any good ones, I think, I'm kinda boring XD
<thunder-colt> This one time, I was watching an episode and my sister comes downstairs in full view on my monitor.
*Silvermane hugs Luna. "You are 2nd best pony, but I loves you"
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11(*deep forlorn sigh()
<DecapKing> Luna's face when every pony is my favorite pony
<Spin> Brother usually uses my Ipod for music in car. Car full of females( excluding me and my bro) Get in forgot pony music playlist.. First song that comes blasting through speakers is Winter Wrap Up. Retrieve Ipod and switch to bros shitty Lil Wayne playlist play it off cool
<Octavia> 13So whos the best pony then Silver? :P
*Luna is happy again
<Blums> and then shebecame a brony?
<Dashite> Luna's face when Silvermane says that to all the fillies...
<Silvermane> Fluttershy
<Blums> lol@ spin
<Octavia> 13Yay, happy Luna is best Luna <3
<Octavia> 13Ahhh.
<Charlie_Horse> I've had no such embarrassing pony moments, I keep myself well-concealed!
<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV4IaC4YmHY
<Sumica> Oki that was ep one might show more later if people want.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about TF2 Is A Perfect Video Game
<Octavia> 13I can agree with that. For the mane 6 anyway.
<thunder-colt> lol Blums. she actually tried to spy on me to see if i would continue watching
<Fluttershy> Huh?
<atomic7732> I don't have any yet...
<Fluttershy> o-o Yes Silvermane?
<Silvermane> Dashite, I do not. I, in fact, do not love Applejack or Rainbow Dash
<Octavia> 13^ X3
<Silvermane> Fluttershy, I was saying you are best pony.
*Silvermane likes moe
<Blums> she secretly wanted to see more
<Silvermane> (pronounce moe-ay)
<DecapKing> you say that to every filly you have ever dated SilverMane
<Dashite> Silvermane likes the barkeep.
<herospirit> Great Silvermane, now they're going to cry themselves to sleep tonight
<Sumica> I hope the subs work on this =p
<thunder-colt> she did once i mentioned it as a movie night choice
<Spin> Ya I still haven't revealed it to my family but my bro probably figured out after that and when he used my computer when I wasn't home I had my wallpaper of the Mane6
<Silvermane> herospirit, they'll get over it
<Pinkie_Pie> Hey
<Fluttershy> Oh my goodness Full Metal Panic! I love this show!
<Ziltoid> oh hai thar fullmetal panic
<Silvermane> after all, they have each other
<Blums> XD
<DecapKing> what is it about?
<Octavia> 13Oh goodness...
<herospirit> Never seen this show
<Ziltoid> Mechs
*Silvermane has never seen this, but has always wanted to
<Octavia> 13Full Metal Panic, what are the odds...
<Ziltoid> and boobs
<Pyroh> WELL! I'm quite happy. Seeing as the the yogscast just had a huge MLP rant!
<Silvermane> suddenly nudity
<atomic7732> My parents do know, I don't really think they know the extent of it though.
<Octavia> 13This is one of the animes my roomie has been watching lately...
<Blums> Simon watched it at least
<Spin> Still need to figure out how I'm gonna explain it to my mom when my Derpy hooves shirt comes in the mail.
<Barry> Hi Octavia
*Fluttershy blushes. "I started watching this show like five years ago."
<Dashite> Odds seem pretty good apparently.
<Silvermane> is this the good kind of mecha?
<Pyroh> 2 of my fav things par 2 getting mashed into 1 video
<thunder-colt> LOL
<Ziltoid> Its pretty good yeah
<Pyroh> Simply amazing
<Octavia> 13Hi Barry
<Sumica> there is a bad kind?
*DecapKing daaws at the thought of Fluttershy blushing
<Dashite> Yes
<thunder-colt> I'd actually like to get a shirt of RD
<Ziltoid> Robots is my fetish
*Silvermane hugs his only 6-named favorite ponies
<thunder-colt> but how do i go about asking parents..
<Spin> Plus the fluttershy flashdrive and the maybe the gummy shirt will require explanation.
<Pyroh> I wonder if anyone has a hip toatto of any of the ponies cutie marks
<Fluttershy> Yay, we're watching it from the beginning. ^^ This is such an awesome series.
<thunder-colt> xD
<Spin> I just asked her to shop online
<Ziltoid> foreshadowing
<Sidestroke> Why not explain it, then?
<DecapKing> what SilverMane, no brohoof?
<Pyroh> Probably, Somewheres in some place. In the back of some dark alley
<Silvermane> huh?
<Pyroh> Theres a cutiem ark specialist
<Pyroh> mark*
<Sidestroke> I mean, there's plenty of valid reasons why this is a great show. Why hide it?
*Silvermane brohoofs DecapKing. FLUTTERSHY YA
<Pyroh> I guareentee!
<herospirit> PENGUIN SAYS GET THE FUCK UP.
*Sumica is an anime nut btw
*DecapKing returns the brohoof
<Spin> My mom gave my guff when she found out I'm still a virgin..my mom's a pothead and probably more masculine than me
<Sidestroke> I always have a knack for making up clever cutie marks
<DecapKing> this is my first time watching anime in forever
<Sumica> *nom*
<thunder-colt> Sidestroke: because I'd be called a gay lunatic or something
<Sidestroke> i.e., they have a secondary meaning
*Silvermane convinced a filly to go to the park for a few hours and then anime club on this saturday.
<herospirit> her thumb must be derishoush
<Narrator> 9Something deep within his processors and circuitry and just behind the ice cream maker, changed. The mare he was sleeping next to... She really thought of him as a friend. She barely knew him, and she really needed him to be her friend.
<Pyroh> Wow spin, Sounds like a nice life you got there
<Spin> yep
<Sidestroke> Then those people can go, if you'll pardon my french, f*ck off. They're too shallow to realize that it's a good show just based on it's looks.
<Colson> it's really hard to tell your friends about FiM when they know that you're gay and will think that's why ;-;
<herospirit> Lolnope
<Pyroh> Lovely
<Dashite> Xmen.
<Fluttershy> whoo still out of it e-e heh...
<Silvermane> 15(inb4 cable sex)
<Plorf> Oh, yeah
<Dashite> This is where Sabretooth comes in.
<DecapKing> 4(bow chicka wow wow)
<thunder-colt> I've told 2 close friends I like MLP and they're cool with it, so that makes me happy.
<Pyroh> Eh, id just rather keep my bronieness to myself
<herospirit> Horrible aim1
<IAmNotAGoat> Sidestroke, internet hoofbump. right now.
*Razyn_the_Pony 11wonders whats wrong with his friends
<Charlie_Horse> I got a couple friends who're cool with it.
<DecapKing> why are the russians in this so cruel?
<Plorf> Colson: I know what you mean-- the ol' power of deduction often comes to wrong conclusions
*Silvermane drapes a foreleg about Fluttershy, comfortingly.
<Spin> Its either this my megalomaniac uncle or my religious fanatic ex-methhead father though my uncle was loaded.
<atomic7732> lol, I've only told one of my friends
<Blums> My friends probably arent aware of ponies and ponies wouldnt concern them at all, so I just dont mention them and if they ask, i'll tell
<herospirit> because they are you decap
<herospirit> All of them are you
*Sidestroke brohoofs immediately
<DecapKing> it makes me feel bad about my people
<Pyroh> EXTREME BROHOOF!
*Fluttershy blushes at Silvermane, but smiles.
<DecapKing> well that would make sense
*Silvermane 15has seen too much hentai and read to many... things
*Pyroh brohooves EXTREMLY
<Colson> :<
<Silvermane> 15(yfw I'm seducing Fluttershy in mane-chat)
<herospirit> The stress of handling so many bodies at once has driven you mad
<DecapKing> 4(and probally writen most of them)
<Sumica> Could this be the start of Silvershy?
<Silvermane> 15(decapking, shh, spoilers)
<IAmNotAGoat> Can I confess that I've never used any of this pony-relevent lingo until now? I feel like 20% more uncool than before XD
<Blums> nickserv on the fritz?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11(I need to know if there are any tentacle clopfics.)
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11(For science)
<Sidestroke> I mean, if I had an opportunity I'd wear brony t-shirts every day. Nothing like shoving it down their throats if they don't like it while also possibly converting some people a little more open-minded.
<Silvermane> Sumica. shhh, spoilers
<Pyroh> Awwww
<Pyroh> Come on
<Blums> dont be silly Iamnotagoat, nopony should feel bad about how they are
<JackiePie> Blums has been for awhile
<Sumica> rofl
<Spin> Well I am trying to reel in the closet bronies by wearing my Power level hiding t shirts (Gummy "pimping aint easy", and my Madame le flour)
<Pyroh> the whole point of being a brony is....well im not entirely sure, But it sure it fun :)
<herospirit> rape face?
<Blums> been what for a while?
<Nashy> I don't use bronyisms.
<DecapKing> ive seen enough Law and Order SVU to know where this is going
<Sumica> Also Hi Ghosties
<Dashite> Yes
<Fluttershy> brb guys real quick. I'm going to get off, then get back on [but it wont be me] then I'll get back on again and it really will be me
<Fluttershy> so brb!
<Plorf> Neither do I
<JackiePie> It refuses to accept passwords when you sign up
<LunaOnTheMoon> I wish I had some pony paraphernalia
<Ghosties> 4Oh, hey
<Plorf> I'm not a hardcore fan, I guess
<Pyroh> Bronyiality, That's the only reality for me
*Silvermane hugs Fluttershy as she falls asleep.
<Blums> ah
<herospirit> wat
<Plorf> Funny considering I'm always on this chatroom
<Ghosties> 4Great streaming, Sumica!
<IAmNotAGoat> Oh good, acceptance is magic
<DecapKing> hey Ghosties
<Charlie_Horse> I've used "Eeeyup," a few times, but that's common enough for plausible deniability.
*Razyn_the_Pony hugs Ghosties
<Silvermane> Okay, i'm free now guys
<Ziltoid> oh hai ghosties
<Sidestroke> I still want that Trixie sweatshirt that had concept art done a while back
<Plorf> But it's really the community
<Sumica> Thanks
<Nashy> I didn't join a cult.
<FreezeFrame> Hey, look, it's Progress-Luna: http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/165/686/abacus.jpg?1314112568
<JackiePie> ?
<Blums> I only use bronyisms with bronies. Though occasionally a Aeeeeyup slips out
<johnsey> Nashy: what makes you so sure about that? :O
<thunder-colt> a mr. turnip shirt sounds cool too
*Silvermane loves Progress: Luna Vs.
<Spin> Plorf: Yeah I like the show but I became a brony for the awesome community.
<DecapKing> free for what SilverMane?
<JackiePie> Calling bronies a cult is more the type of behavior I'd expect at derpyhooves.com
<Octavia> 13Lmao
<Ghosties> 4Hey guys
<Sidestroke> Yes. You joined a *sunglasses* Colt!
<IAmNotAGoat> I need a good place to pick up some of the brony swag, but I can't find a quality online store ugggh
<Sumica> Smooth inuendo Kurt.
<Sidestroke> YEAAAH
<Sidestroke> Anyway
<Nashy> Seems like a cult to some people.
<DecapKing> XD
<DecapKing> are all anime shows like this?
<Dashite> (For science? Un-huh...)
<Spin> Iamnotagoa: 1 sec
<IAmNotAGoat> People who are close-minded
<Silvermane> DecapKing, shipping in general
<thunder-colt> Sidestroke: http://yeahbutton.com
<Blums> cult? implying that we dont let members leave
<JackiePie> Yup Goat
<Silvermane> an no, not all are anything like this
<Sumica> like what?
<Spin> http://ocularproof.spreadshirt.com/
<Sumica> and mostlikly the answer is no
<Spin> good subtle shirts
<Sidestroke> And yeah, it's not a cult, but just a reeeeeeaaaaally active fanbase.
<IAmNotAGoat> I mean, it's not like we do weird cult junk...like human sacrifice....
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11(I need to run tests on how effective it is=Science)
<IAmNotAGoat> AND YAY~! Thank you Spin
<DecapKing> full of inuendo, giant robots, violence, so on
<Silvermane> anime is like any other show; varies as widely as the creatores
<Sidestroke> Like, reeeeeeeeeee*etc*ally.
*Colson sacrifices IAmNotAGoat
<Ziltoid> inb4 condom joke
<DecapKing> 4(no Razyn, just no)
<Sumica> is this where I say no only the good ones
<Nashy> The community is not a cult, but some act like they are part of one.
<Blums> i think cults are more about taking actions to prevent people from leaving the group
<VioletVanilla> What anime is this? o.o
<Spin> http://equestrianswag.spreadshirt.com/

<Ziltoid> exclamation point very important
<Silvermane> yes?
<Sumica> A team knock off theme
<IAmNotAGoat> Spin, I love you in the most bronie-tastic way possible

<Narrator> 9 ...Aside from Razyn, Boombox had never met someone so lonely. It made him sad, knowing that somepony didn't have a single friend. He recorded only one thing as he entered sleep mode. He had to stay with this mare for as long as he could. Until she at least found more friends of her own.
<Kel> saw this site linked on reddit, decided to see what it'd be like for when mlp season 2 starts. Log in, see FMP ep 1. Fuck, there goes my evening. Time to make some popcorn

<dashie> eyeception
*FallSilently plays Magic
<DecapKing> dat eyeception
<Kel> I could always do with more FMP
<Silvermane> herospirit, Japan isn't as paranoid as we are. perhaps they assumed it was a toy

<PsychicKid> That
<Silvermane> 15mfw i can't stop looking at that picture
<muttstuffle> huh, just my luck, I join at the END
<herospirit> TRUST NO ONE SILVERMANE
<Nashy> Besides, I don't see where you are going with all this...
<dashie> Id like so some FMA
*Silvermane trusts 'No One'. I hope he's a nice pony
<FallSilently> It's good if you're a starter.
*Dermathil jumps back in Space Marine multiplayer.
<PsychicKid> k, cuz I own literally 75 magic cards
<Razyn_the_Pony> TRUST ANYONE, HEROSPIRIT
<Razyn_the_Pony> :0
<Silvermane> Dashie, I like this plan. Especially if it means I finally get to see the movie
<Pinkie_Pie> Herospirit, Bunker
<muttstuffle> do you use /me to do that?
<herospirit> And watch the shoulder, not the arm! The shoulder moves first!!!
*muttstuffle likes pie
<DecapKing> how do you know my alias SilverMane?
<PsychicKid> And I'm not looking to dump a ton of money into it or play seriously at lots of tournaments, I just wanna have some cards to play with friends
<Pinkie_Pie> Hmmm
<Plorf> My bro has like 1000
<FallSilently> Well then it's probably good. I saw one opened and it gives you pretty much all the basics you'll need.
<PsychicKid> http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Deck_Builder%27s_Toolkit_2011 Here's a spoiler, idk what's good
<herospirit> How goes
<Colgate> 4 boosters and 125 other cards, hmm
<johnsey> haha http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/ponies.html so true
<Silvermane> That's on a need to know basis
<Filter> BOOKS
<Colgate> depends on what the other cards are
<johnsey> damn you seth
<PsychicKid> They sell them at my locals for $20
<Pinkie_Pie> I think I will be using Rainbow_Dash for the time being
<Filter> .
<PsychicKid> The way I look at it, 4 packs is $16 right
<PsychicKid> So you're paying $4 for a buncha extra cards
<Kad> confound these ponies, they drive me to buy lisenced shirts
<Filter> .
<FallSilently> Yeah, and $4 for the rest is a good price.
*Silvermane is sad that ReticentSmolder/MirthTinker is grounded
<PsychicKid> The intro deck I bought is Blood and Fire
<Spin> *sigh* you sir are being stubborn but its okay I don't want to discuss anymore maybe someone else does but have fun :)
<herospirit> Also, if you know someone down in a fight, make sure they don't get back up for a while!
<PsychicKid> Red/Black
*herospirit foams at the mouth
<FallSilently> From M12?
<PsychicKid> Yeah
<Spin> So books?
<HaysforPonies> Octy!
<johnsey> http://cosplay.paheal.net/post/view/45358
<PsychicKid> I think the toolkit was released in 2011
<johnsey> i want that suit
<PsychicKid> So I dunno when it's gonna get rotated out
*DecapKing is glad that he isnt grounded
<PsychicKid> (I don't have any idea how/when Magic's set rotation works)
<Nashy> And you're not making much sense to me, so probably for the best.
<Kad> paheal? pretty sure do not want
<Colgate> ewll, the 125 cards does have quit a few good cards for standard, if that's what you want
<Spin> To each his own.
<FallSilently> Magic sets rotate at the end of September. I forget when new Toolkits are released, though.
<herospirit> My mom taught me her ethics for fighting. There is no such thing as dirty fighting.
<PsychicKid> To my knowledge there's only been two
<Colgate> doom blade, condemn, mana leak
<PsychicKid> One in 2010, one in 2011
<Silvermane> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-please-stop-clopping.jpg
<johnsey> Kad: it's just a twilight sparkle cosplay :P
<HaysforPonies> That suit's...not too bad. Don't think I would ever wear one though.
<Kad> I'll be
<Kad> bet
<Kad> paheal is kinda famous for it's rule34
<Octavia> Evening, everpony.
<Colgate> there is quite a bit of trashy cards though
<Colson> you'll be bet
<PsychicKid> I dunno if one is coming out in 2012 or not, cuz if there is I'd just wait for that one y'know
<FallSilently> Yeah, but I don't know what month they were released in.
<johnsey> hey Octavia
<Silvermane> dirty fighting only exists when sparring
<Razyn_the_Pony> LIES ALL LIES
<Spin> Now I'm wishing I had ended the debate earlier because I have no idea what you guys are talking about now :P
<thunder-colt> hi tavi
<DecapKing> thats nice SilverMane, although from you alone shouldnt the pony race be extinct?
<PsychicKid> 2011 was May, 2010 was March so
<Spin> Hi Octavia!
<PsychicKid> err, flip those months
<PsychicKid> 2011 march, 2010 may
<Razyn_the_Pony> Dohoho
<herospirit> Yesh Silvermane, that's different, of course.
<Silvermane> lol DecapKing. Why would I do that when i get ALL the fillies?
<Charlie_Horse> Well hello.
<Razyn_the_Pony> ...And RS
<DecapKing> because its a lie
<Leika> Oh god... that Amnesia video... XD
<PsychicKid> Oh. I have my years mixed up. Talking about Magic core 2012
<Razyn_the_Pony> That one time.
<PsychicKid> Made me think it was the year 2012
<PsychicKid> WELL THEN.
<Silvermane> and RS that one time... *sigh*
<FallSilently> :)
<PsychicKid> Yeah see Colgate I figured there's trashy cards in them
<PsychicKid> Yugioh's the same way
<Pinkie_Pie> Prince-Dari, are you lurking?
<PsychicKid> But I dunno which are trashy
<Silvermane> he's asleep. bot
<DecapKing> Dari always lurks
<Pinkie_Pie> I see
<Spin> Yo dawg I'm pro at Yugioh!
<PsychicKid> No you're not.
<PsychicKid> Yugioh has no pros.
<Filter> Someone has to be pro
<Colgate> most cards are pretty easy to tell if they are bad ;)
<PsychicKid> Not if there's no pro circuit
<DecapKing> dem anime sound effects
<Rainbow_Dash> Behold, your new overlord
<Spin> Hell Ya I am I gots that Pyro dragon negro!
<thunder-colt> Leika: lol, ikr?
<IAmNotAGoat> He said I wasn't a pro........so I sent him to the shadow realm
<IAmNotAGoat> sorry that was dumb XD
<Colson> Pyro dragon negro?

<Plorf> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2PM5iTlmRE
<Rainbow_Dash> 20% cooler than that other owner.
<PsychicKid> At the very least I've been able to tell which cards are playable
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<DecapKing> that sounds reasonable

<DecapKing> dat unintentional tackle
<PsychicKid> It comes with 20 of each
<Spin> without the period of course
<Blums> apparently some people are having problems with registering tho
<Blums> maybe its fixed now
*Spin feels like he helped.
<Colgate> yeah, I could see lands being a big problem if you haven't played much mtg
<Spin> whats MTG?
<PsychicKid> Magic: The Gathering
<Colgate> magic the gathering
<Spin> Oh
<PsychicKid> Yeah, the only lands I own are the ones that came with my intro deck
<Spin> I sucked at that
<Silvermane> dat porno music

<VioletVanilla> 6Whoooaaa~

<Sumica> How about Star driver after this.
<Rainbow_Dash> I am Pinkie_Pie
<PsychicKid> But I can't go this Friday, I got a Yugioh regional on Saturday, so I'm driving up to stay the night at a friend's house Friday
<Silvermane> oh
<Rainbow_Dash> I switched, for the time being
<FallSilently> Whut?
<Silvermane> booo
<PsychicKid> Whut what?
<FallSilently> Spin whut.
<Silvermane> I broke in
<herospirit> :0
<PsychicKid> St. Louis regional is this Saturday :V
<PsychicKid> Oh.
<Silvermane> also, FLUTTERSHY
<herospirit> FUUUU
<Blums> I sense this night's drawfriend having a nice splash of applejack
<Rainbow_Dash> And so did that annoying Boombox..
<Spin> You said "If you find a local Friday Night Magic, they'll probably give you free lands"
<TuxRug> Is it a true PMV if it includes original (non-show) animation (not including effects or modifications)?
*Silvermane glomps Fluttershy without colliding into the floor.
<Boombox> ...? ...*
<Silvermane> wings babay
<Blums> if it has music and is a video related to pony
<DecapKing> Russians speaking Japanese?
<DecapKing> cant explain that
<PsychicKid> Well I don't wanna be a bum either
<herospirit> I am admin?
<PsychicKid> I don't wanna be all "YO GIMME YO LANDS"
<Silvermane> Mithrils ass
<herospirit> TOO mUCH POWER
<herospirit> HNNNNG
<Filter> There was a very OP card that taps to make a land a 3/3 flying that is also a land
<Spin> Why not?
<Razyn_the_Pony> :0
<triple> =O
<Spin> Hello triple!
<FallSilently> That wasn't overpowered....
<triple> wut is dis
<Spin> How are you!
<triple> bueno
*TuxRug had an idea for a PMV that looks really great in my head, but there's several issues. 1: I can use a video editor, but not well enough to do any lip sync. 2: the idea would require some original animation (especially Spike) and I don't know a thing about flash.
<Spin> te gusta?
<triple> uhh
<Rainbow_Dash> Fluttershy has been AFK for 37 minutes
<Colgate> Filter: I think you're thinking of http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Mishra%27s+Factory
<triple> i guess....
<Spin> bien
<Colgate> not quite the same, but still a very good card
<Filter> nah, it was somethin else
*Silvermane cries that he glomped a comatose pegasus
<triple> 0.0
<Filter> ohyea! snow lands only
<Filter> came in a snow deck though
<Rainbow_Dash> Not only that, you glomped a comatose pegasus that probably didnt really want to be suddenly glomped
<herospirit> dat scary angry face
<DecapKing> dat lag
<^Stargazer> ?
<Blums> All i know about flash is newframe, draw, newframe,draw, newframe, draw
<PsychicKid> Anyway
<Rainbow_Dash> You should feel ashamed..
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
<PsychicKid> Thanks for the info Colgate, FallSilently
<Colgate> I haven't seen a snow land in a long time
<herospirit> dat upskirt
<Silvermane> well I used my wings to keep us in the air, so she wouldn't get hurt
<Filter> it was a creature that makes snow lands into 3/3 flyings
<thunder-colt> all i know about flash is: ..
<Filter> and still lands
<PsychicKid> I'm a bit disappointed that the Toolkit doesn't have Divination in it
<Colgate> though I play legacy almost exclusively now, so yeah
<Sumica> kana is such a troll
<FallSilently> Balduvian Frostwaker. They're 2/2.
<PsychicKid> I wanna turn my Red/Black into Red/Blue
<herospirit> She still annoys me for some reason
<PsychicKid> The minute I saw Divination, I had to run some form of Blue
<triple> dashy colors <33333
<Plorf> Rainbow Dash's character design is one of the main reasons I got into MLP

<Blums> XD better than me Tuxrug, I spent half an hour drawing hat linework
<PsychicKid> Say Ancestral Recall and I dropkick you
<^Stargazer> Dash is cool and all, but I'm excited about them all lol
<Spin> or Fluttershy..which ever one you like I guess..
<ShadTheCrazed> Y'know, I think I can cosplay Big Mac.
<DecapKing> the fact that chat has become nearly silent
<Colgate> jayce's ingenuity is 5, but it is instant speed and 3 cards
<TuxRug> Took me two tries to even get a usable sketch. First one was horrible
<Filter> hmmeh
<triple> do girls watch my little pony
<thunder-colt> !s2
<Spin> Don't you need 2 people for that?
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 9d:12h:07m:59s
<thunder-colt> asdf!
<Rainbow_Dash> He's a SPY
<thunder-colt> CANT WAIT

<Colson> Eeyup.
<PsychicKid> When will that card get rotated out though?
<Lysiria> lol.
<Blums> Eeeeeeeeeenope

<Blums> yes triple?
<Lysiria> Greetings, Lemon_Lime
<Spin> 10 seconds flat.
<Colgate> PsychicKid: I don't know, it might already be out actually
<Silvermane> OMFG
<FallSilently> When will which card rotate out? Balduvian Frostwaker's long gone. And it's actually quite weak.
<Blums> Like this: eeenope
<Colgate> I don't play standard
<Silvermane> dat lolicon
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this picture in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<Lemon_Lime> Greetings Lysiria
<Spin> yay~
<PsychicKid> Well Friday Night Magic is Standard
<PsychicKid> So
<PsychicKid> Yeah :V
<Razyn_the_Pony> LOLICON?
<ShadTheCrazed> Needs to be about 20% cooler.
<triple> lets have an orgy
<Rainbow_Dash> Im not sure if I should be laughing or crying at that
<Spin> PG Pony orgy/
<DecapKing> 4the fact this chat is silent
<Spin> *?
<Lysiria> I'm 10 and what is this
<Blums> an overindulgance of pony watching?
<triple> PG
<Rainbow_Dash> Or both
<triple> PG 13
<ShadTheCrazed> triple: Apple Jack - Mmm, nah.
<herospirit> What the poop did I miss?
<Silvermane> either that, or he is an idol-obsessed nut job
<triple> nope.avi
<Silvermane> also, WHAT THE HELL
<PsychicKid> Well, if I can get some Divinations from the common bin at locals, why not
<DecapKing> dat boob grab
<PsychicKid> I just made $70 from selling some Yugioh cards anyway
<FallSilently> The vast majority of what's in the Toolkit will be Standard-legal for another year. A handful of the M11 cards may leave in a few weeks.
<Discord> Remember, the next rotation occurs just a couple weeks.
<PsychicKid> But most of that is going towards a box of Photon Shockwave
<Silvermane> did she just... enjoy that? In an anime? That's a first. normally they just hit the guy. yay realism
<PsychicKid> Ahh, ok.
<PsychicKid> So uh how's it work
<Discord> When that gothic horror set comes out.
<DecapKing> XD
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11...is not a sentence.
<Rainbow_Dash> Anime girls are always so vicious.
<Spin> How I imagine a PG orgy= "mmm yeah hold my hand!! OH YEAH! You too don't be shy Hold it nice and tight! OH YEAH!!"
<Discord> (Man, those double-faced cards that set introduces are weird.)
*Silvermane 15is busy humping nightmare moons leg
<PsychicKid> Yeah I Saw those
<PsychicKid> Yugioh just introduced a new type of monster too
<Sumica> Dynamic exit!
<PsychicKid> They were slow on getting official rulings out, so one card broke $200 on secondary market
*Razyn_the_Pony 11is about to go exercise insix
<DecapKing> dat chill face
<PsychicKid> But then when the new rulebook came out, it dropped to $80
<Discord> Soooooooooo a PG orgy is essentially Fluttershy.
<PsychicKid> Then people raged for spending $600 on a set
<mook> http://ponyspin.com/
<PsychicKid> :V
<Silvermane> hentai-san?
<Rainbow_Dash> Hentai-San...
<FallSilently> I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh! but I hear their rulings system is a mess.
<Silvermane> is that like the girl name Yuri?
<PsychicKid> It's making progress.
<DecapKing> dat dramatic train jump
<Silvermane> where it isn't the perversion we think it is?
<PsychicKid> They recently introduced a new syntax for card text to eliminate a lot of confusion.
<Colgate> I don't try to understand yugioh anymore XD
<Sumica> no it's just as it sounds
<herospirit> LOL
<Spin> The cartoon has become quite ridicilous or so I hear/
<Skipsy> Doing a bit of pony sketching, hopefully my internet doesn't fail me now. http://www.livestream.com/skipsysdoodles
<PsychicKid> Anything involving the damage step is cryptic and pandora's box-y
<Razyn_the_Pony> This guy...
<PsychicKid> And explaining priority to players is a nightmare too
<DecapKing> jumping out of a train is a coincidence?
<herospirit> He is so fucking smooth. "suddenly I wanted to get off at this station"
<PsychicKid> Especially to so-called "pro players" who fling the term around and really don't know what it means -_-
<PsychicKid> It makes the judge in me pissed off
<Spin> Especially kids who can't take ajoke.
<Colgate> priority is just who has the chance to play a spell, or use any ability
<PsychicKid> Exactly.
<PsychicKid> I've heard players saying
<Colgate> if both players pass, something happens
<roushguy> I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh
<PsychicKid> "I'M USING MY PRIORITY" or "I HAVE PRIORITY"
<Colgate> it is pretty simple!
<PsychicKid> err
<roushguy> I play Magic The Gathering
<PsychicKid> *RETAIN
<Discord> There's reasons I stick with Magic.
<SkyRings> hello everypony !
<PsychicKid> You don't "use" priority, you either have it or you don't
<Sumica> Going to refresh the stream after this ep.
<Colgate> roushguy: well, it is the same in mtg
<PsychicKid> Also: "He gets priority, so I use his effect"
<PsychicKid> Cards never have priority, only players do
<PsychicKid> Colgate, in Japan, they changed the way Ignition effects work
<Colgate> ignition?
<PsychicKid> You can no longer play an Ignition effect in response to a successful summon
<Silvermane> dat upskirt
<Kel> dem panties
<herospirit> again, upskirt
<ShadTheCrazed> YOU ARE ALREADY PARTYING
<PsychicKid> Yeah, like Exiled Force for example
<DecapKing> dat ass
<PsychicKid> It's just an effect you manually activate.
<roushguy> Got hold of a Naya deck, and did some major revamping with critters old and new. I've got around 40 creatures, only seven or so instants/enchants/sorceries, and 21 lands
<Rainbow_Dash> And so, Japanese kids watch this every day on TV?
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
<Silvermane> Full Metal Panic: I watch it for the plot
<ShadTheCrazed> -what i'll say when someone enters the door on a party
<Blums> Nyan deck?
<SkyRings> what's going on there ?
<herospirit> Nope. Japanese teenagers :P
<PsychicKid> Priority is usually used in discussion involving Ignition effects since that's when it most commonly gets brought up.
<Colgate> roushguy: that's uh, a big deck
<FallSilently> Sticking to 60 cards is always best, though.
<Rainbow_Dash> Eh, close enough =P
<DecapKing> dat cat
<Colgate> slim it down to 60
<Spin> So lets start a convo where its not 2 people hogging the chat please..
<roushguy> Nah
<roushguy> Trust me
<PsychicKid> When Japan announced they were changing Ignition effects, American players went on hurrdurrretard mode and immediately thought that Priority itself was going away
<PsychicKid> If priority went away in Yugioh, then Yugioh would not even exist as a game -_-
<roushguy> It gets going, it's near impossible to stop without disenchantment.
<SkyRings> feeling like Fluttershy in the begging of the episode dragonshy
<FallSilently> Spin: I see six or seven people hogging the chat. Feel free to hog some yourself.
<Sumica> normally anime like this would be prime time or late night.
<ShadTheCrazed> I'd still love for the mane six to hop on my back so I can carry 'em around. That'd be the best time of my life for some reason.
<SkyRings> speaking and no one notice
<roushguy> Wild Pair, Lurking Predators, and a ton of 5/5's
<Spin> So *ehem* How about them ponies..
<roushguy> And 6/6's
<Colgate> priority is kind of important.... so you can't just chain stuff off of yourself without your opponent having a chance
<PsychicKid> Yeah.
<DecapKing> dat blush
<Silvermane> FUCK YOU GUYS< DRAWFRIENDS I HERE
<PsychicKid> I've heard a palyer, who is a veteran of several years say during a duel
<Rainbow_Dash> That evil laugh
<Thunder_Dash> > join stream
<Thunder_Dash> > that laugh
<herospirit> Dat weird ass laugh
<Rainbow_Dash> She is Rarity
<PsychicKid> "You can't do that, priority doesn't exist anymore."
<FallSilently> It sounds a bit fragile, roushguy, but I'd have to see it to get a really good idea.
<Rainbow_Dash> Quick, we must map the characters to the mane 6!
<PsychicKid> I wanted to flip a table
<roushguy> It is fragile
<roushguy> I mean
<Colgate> better have some fetches to get those lurker predators
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Drawfriend Stuff #178 (http://tinyurl.com/3nyq2f5)
<roushguy> If they have enchantment destruction
<Colgate> lurking*
<PsychicKid> Anyway
<Blums> DF!

<CogWeaver> drawfriend!
<roushguy> Or if the can burn my mana production out before it gets rolling, I'm toast
<PsychicKid> Tomorrow or sometime next week I'm gonna buy the deck toolkit
<Colgate> seems like a very fragile strategy

<Blums> aww the applejack one didnt make it on the drawfriend
<Blums> what a crime
<Spin> I love the last one
<Rainbow_Dash> I was actually thinking about Scootaloo giving tickets to Rainbow Dash earlier today
*Silvermane hugs Fluttershy. "I missed you"
<Ziltoid> What are we watching now?
<Blums> http://axian-art.deviantart.com/art/A-Hard-Day-s-Apple-Bucking-257291790
<Rainbow_Dash> I can predict the future!!
<DecapKing> SilverMane is thinking "Want or do not want"
<DecapKing> hey Fluttershy
*Fluttershy blushes. "Awww...."
<Silvermane> DecapKing, I do not want Pinkamina
<FallSilently> Sweaters are not as good as socks. This is fact. This is reality.
<Fluttershy> Hey there. ^^; Sorry for suddenly disappearing. I got super hungry so I went to get dinner.
<HaysforPonies> I will agree on that
<Silvermane> I can't handle such an... energetic filly
<Discord> #9: "GRAB MY TAIL, SCOOTALOO!"
<Ziltoid> dat ass shot
<DecapKing> SilverManes mind
<herospirit> How hard would we hav to try to get Twilight's VA to narrorate "Go the Fuck to Sleep"?
<PsychicKid> Homework time
<DecapKing> "I watch it for the plot"
<Fluttershy> o-o Things certainly got interesting in here, too.
<Spin> Homework...
<Colson> untz
<Fluttershy> Again, sorry for disappearing suddenly... ^^; I was really, really hungry
<Spin> thanks for reminding me
<DecapKing> 4mfw this chat is still silent
<thunder-colt> aw snap. totally forgot to finish mine
<thunder-colt> :S
<DecapKing> whats with the chick in a maid outfit and bunny ears?
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
*Razyn_the_Pony 11is going to exercise now. If you're complaining, start shipping!
<Luna> 07what's with the bunny ears..?
<Spin> haha lets see if I can multitask as well as I think I can
<Rainbow_Dash> I can predict the future
<Discord> I like the double twist of #13. Initial view: "Oh, Celestia, it's Pinkamina with blood on her lips." Realization: "Oh, wait, that's just ketchup on her lips from that hot dog in the background." Second Realization: "Wait... hot dog? Oh no."
<Rainbow_Dash> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dJIohYF4SgM/TmgG3v6rP0I/AAAAAAAALuE/ojP9ixzwE_M/s1600/tickets_to_your_friendship_by_ctb_36-d493d9y.png

<Luna> 07I see!

<Fluttershy> talking about fetishes and all... this is one I saw and I was like 'oh my goodness he did not just...'
<Sumica> Kinda like code geass
<DannySwish> mmmeh.
<Ziltoid> I have seen this before
<thunder-colt> If x = more ponies, what then?

<DecapKing> ok that was an odd image
<herospirit> I believe you mean "dat" image
<HotCocoa> 1. I don't get pinged, I get hilights, and 2. I don't mind being mentioned because I want to know if I miss something :P
<DannySwish> Algebra's easy. I just HATE it.
<Silvermane> The King of Shipping asked you a question, miss Pie. Or is it miss Dash, now.
<Fluttershy> heh... ^^;
<thunder-colt> exactly
<herospirit> What are we watching anyways? :0
<thunder-colt> i started pre calc this year. i miss algebra now
<DecapKing> 4mfw i come back tommorow and Fluttershy is in here
<HaysforPonies> I'm in the middle of studying brain anatomy. Not so bad but I always feel like I'm missing something.
<Fluttershy> good question o-o
<Sumica> I dont have dark shades to go with it herospirit
<DannySwish> I get pinged /and/ highlited
<DannySwish> hawhawhaw
<Rainbow_Dash> Dash, I suppose

<CogWeaver> psh, RL n00bs, Calculus is where it's at
<Silvermane> 15shh, spoilers
<Spin> Trig this year and I hate not because it hard but because its the normal Trig class so all the seniors make the class agonizingly slow and easy
<Charlie_Horse> I wish my math classes were like that. :[
<Silvermane> DecapKing, it is one of my wallpapers that rotate in and out
<thunder-colt> i wish my java class was like that
<Silvermane> and it makes me go DAAWWWWWWWWW
<Silvermane> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/159/3/c/here__s_your_ice_cream_sis____by_johnjoseco-d3icjlw.jpg
<Spin> I sit there for like 20 mins doodling while he explains everything 10 times makes me mad
<thunder-colt> it went too fast for me
<herospirit> OH GOD HER FACE
<Silvermane> Luna's face is so cute. full of OMFGYAY~
<DecapKing> do you want to see my wallpaper?
<CogWeaver> I know how you feel, Spin
*Luna loves it
<VioletVanilla> K6inb4 red haired L from DeathNote?
<Silvermane> yes
<Spin> but my mandarin class was the exact opposite holy hell thats hard
<CogWeaver> math was always TOO easy for me
<Rainbow_Dash> Herospirit, check the bunker, y- OMG
<Rainbow_Dash> THAT FACE
<herospirit> Could you repost as a link Silvermane?
<HaysforPonies> Math was always easy for me. Then Calculus happened.
<Rainbow_Dash> Shes evil...
<CogWeaver> I hated that class because there was nothing to do most of the time!
*VioletVanilla loves that Luna and Celestia picture~
*Filter is jelly
<CogWeaver> Calculus is always a stumbling block
<Rainbow_Dash> Herospirit, I am a prophet
<Spin> I think numbers is my foreign language
<Luna> 07saved!
<Filter> was and is terrible at maths
*Silvermane just realized that the image Fluttershy posted is by the same artist as what I posted
<Spin> *native

<Charlie_Horse> I am so bad at the maths.
<DannySwish> lawl maths
<DecapKing> 4so is that a yes?
<Charlie_Horse> ...well, not horribly bad, more just the upper-class stuff.
<Silvermane> Also, one of my favorite artists for some reason
<DannySwish> so what do you call it math's?
<DannySwish> maths's?
<Blums> theoretical maths!
<Silvermane> 15probably not
<Filter> Im bad a grammers too
<thunder-colt> i just can't get back into the swing of things at school
<Filter> aparrently
<Spin> You know you do too much math when you use equations to memorize your phone numbers
<DecapKing> 4awww, but it would be interesting!
<DannySwish> Math. Math's stupid. (America)
<HaysforPonies> I just noticed we are almost at 37k.
<Filter> YAY
<DannySwish> Maths. Maths's stupid. (England or wherever :3)
<DecapKing> 4and possibly funny!
<Spin> 37k?
<thunder-colt> i find myself thinking over approach procedures for salt lake intl when i should be taking a test
<DannySwish> xD
<Filter> i like it when the numbers go to zero
<Spin> oh on eq
<HaysforPonies> 37m huh
<Spin> I's silly

<Spin> crap my homewrok :P
<DecapKing> 4dat Fluttershy face in the background
<Thunder_Dash> I was gonna ask, does this show have an intro or no? And then intro.

<Charlie_Horse> Hello!
<herospirit> Lol. I'd ask for a scoop of ice cream for every hundred years I was on the moon.
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Lods of emone
<VioletVanilla> 6Only ten scoops? D:
<Ziltoid> breasts
<Denied_Existence> 3Hello again.
<Silvermane> wow Herospirit, not hard to satisfy you is it
<Spin> I suck at english though not because I can't write but because I hate the stupid "layout" bs i.e. MLA format plus the whole Thesis statement BS
*Plorf in which plorf posts more youtube videos
<VioletVanilla> 6<.<
<Rainbow_Dash> 1000 years on the moon, and all you want is 10 scoops of ice cream?
<Plorf> oh man, I can either write a lot in terms of essays
<Plorf> or nothing
<Plorf> it tends to be nothing
<Sumica> Must be realy good
<Plorf> my mind is sort of turning in on itself
<DecapKing> i would ask for a can of red bull for every 100 years i spent on the moon
<herospirit> I hold my grudges quietly.
<SkyRings> I'm working on this these days http://skyrings.deviantart.com/#/d496s5y
<Blums> "Write an essay on this random picture of two people's feet we found off google images
<HaysforPonies> My mind clicks off of focusing on something occassionally.
<Silvermane> http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=72#/d3ikirk
<DecapKing> 4hey
<HaysforPonies> My brain basically becomes Derpy.
<Silvermane> 15oh look at that
<herospirit> Just kidding, I suck at holding grudges
*Silvermane 15punches Denied_Existence in the face. "DON'T SNEAK UP ON ME LIKE THAT"
<Silvermane> 15http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=72#/d3ikirk
<Filter> my mind can never focus very long
<Spin> Worst thing is embedding quotes I'm liek what If I jsut put em in a box somewhere and refer to em that way.and by box i mean trash and by trash I mean recycle bin because I like trees.
<Plorf> Over the past few days, I've legitimately though I've been going insane

<Rainbow_Dash> Thats the funniest thing I have heard on an Anime so far
<Rainbow_Dash> Somehow
<ShadTheCrazed> Yeah, after ponies, that comic describes it all.
<Spin> Must see said comic
<herospirit> And possibly a new Bronystate in-meme
<ShadTheCrazed> Did I mention I could possibly cosplay Big Macintosh?
<JackiePie> It's funny
<Sumica> lol
<Thunder_Dash> I find engrish hilarious to begin with, TBH :P
<Filter> yes
<Denied_Existence> 3kk. But she isn't always available.
<SkyRings> Rease, from Malcom ?
<Barry> Falcon... PAUNCH!!
<JackiePie> *dreams of ponies* FFUUUUUU
<Blums> Ugh.. was gonna do something but I totally forgot what it was just before I was gonna do it
<herospirit> CAPITEN, FALKOHN!
<Blums> Dumb Brain.
*HaysforPonies has dreamed of pony about 7 times in the past 3 weeks.
<ShadTheCrazed> Blonde hair, green eyes, buff. Eeyup, now all I need is a costume and a hat.
<Silvermane> 15tis fine. the King of SHipping simply wishes to meet such a worthy subject
<ShadTheCrazed> Rarity - Now all you need is a hat!
<Filter> are you red?
<thunder-colt> the other day i had this weird dream that rarity was making me clothes
<Sumica> suddenly giant robots
<Filter> didn't think so
<Barry> You watched the F-Zero anime?
<herospirit> I missed the name of this. AGAIN. WHAT ARE WE WATCHING
<Ziltoid> lolwut?
<Sumica> Star driver
<Thunder_Dash> Star Driver, I think
<ShadTheCrazed> Filter: Gotta find a red costume and put BM's cutie mark on the back.
<SkyRings> hi UberMudkipz
<herospirit> And Barry, naw, just that scen
<herospirit> scene*

<SkyRings> I liek mudkips
<Plorf> Well, that's interesting
<Charlie_Horse> Who doesn't?
<Plorf> I was informed of a family problem with one of my cousins
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/6.png
<DecapKing> 4is that even possible?
<Filter> I too has a feeling of positivity towards the group of pixels that is Mudkip
<Plorf> Though I think sharing it would derail the chat
<Spin> Well I have brown hair green eyes and I am average weight and slightly below hieght all I need is 4 hooves. Blonde paint. Mane. Tail. Gray paint and lazy eye.
<herospirit> I want to write an anime where the main character ISN'T one of the chosen ones.
<Filter> ShadTheCrazed: paint yourself red and run around naked! :)
<Denied_Existence> 3I have no clue.
<Denied_Existence> 3But then again, I barely know him
<ShadTheCrazed> filter: Fluttershy - NO!
<Silvermane> 15didn't see that image
<Spin> Filter: but then Fox can say thats what we all do ..oh wait IT IS.
<Filter> LOL
<Sumica> yes that is his name
<Silvermane> 15also, I'm technically involved with MirthTinker in this channel
<Rainbow_Dash> Galactic Pretty Boy
<Rainbow_Dash> Mhm....
<Thunder_Dash> all two of three anime I've seen are murder mysteries, soo... yeah
<Thunder_Dash> * all of three
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh Silver, your just jealous that I have such a good writer all to myself~
*Filter logs off, takes of clothes, and steps out the door
<SkyRings> oh no, Rose
<Thunder_Dash> I've forgotten how to speak English apparently, *All of the three.
<JackiePie> There's this really cool series on Science channel called Dark Matters, about science experiments gone wrong or too far.
<Spin> I just imagined a news cast with videos of dudes running around covered in bright paint holding ponies screaming quotes from the show.. god I hope that doesn't find me in my sleep.
<Silvermane> 15it was a pretty /short/ lived coupling, IMO
*Plorf opens the door
*Plorf gets on the floor
*Plorf everybody walks the dinosaur
<Ziltoid> hes so fabulous
<herospirit> But I mean, I want to write an anime where there ARE chosen ones, destiny and what not, but the main character is an average Joe.
<Denied_Existence> 3Well DecapKing wasn't exactly giving her much to work with was he?
<Thunder_Dash> yeah, I understand what you mean
<Filter> Darn cops ruined all my fun
<Sumica> Sounds like eurika 7

<Rainbow_Dash> Sounds like something he would say?
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<DecapKing> 4Bro's for life Silvermane

<Silvermane> 15i don't have a fetish or anything >.>
<Silvermane> WOOT
<Denied_Existence> 3I probably would too...but rarity isn't really my type.
*Silvermane restrains himself
<Denied_Existence> 3xD
<SkyRings> what ? run around covered with pain ?
<SkyRings> are you crazy ?
*Fluttershy blinks. "Are you okay?"
<Thunder_Dash> or requesting, rather
<herospirit> No, Ziltoid, it's nothing dirty. Before you ask :P
<Spin> Oatmeal!
<Silvermane> No more crushing Fluttershy, Silvermane. No more of that.
<thunder-colt> <Pinkie Pie> Are you loco in the coco?

*Silvermane smiles at her concern. "I've just been hyper and I don't want to bend any of your feathers"
<Sumica> it just might
<HaysforPonies> Season 2. Best birthday gift.
<Ziltoid> now whats this

*Filter wonders how one runs around covered in pain

<Silvermane> 15Rarity is the the most... something of the mane 6
<SkyRings> 9 days...
<herospirit> So they know what "weird" is
<thunder-colt> It's the only thing keeping me going through school
*Fluttershy blinks. "Well, they all seem fine for now." ^^
<Sumica> I dont have bobobobobobo
<Thunder_Dash> Weird? FLCL.
<herospirit> Damn. 3:
<SkyRings> just 9 days...
<Filter> AtomicCocoa

<Silvermane> 15mfw Fluttershy is enjoying the attention in #bunker
<Rainbow_Dash> I heard about an anime where there are soda cans that turn into hot girls.
<Spin> thunder-colt: what happens come the end of S2
<Spin> ?
<DecapKing> 4http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/126/2/4/by_luna__s_might_by_johnjoseco-d3foxgc.jpg
<Fluttershy> Does anypony know what 'Welcome to the NHK' is perchance? o-o
<Rainbow_Dash> This cant be as weird as that..
<Denied_Existence> 3Howso?
<HotCocoa> 'Sup
<Nashy> Are you insane in the membrane?
<Colgate> we do stuff again
<thunder-colt> i watch it all starting from season 1 again
<Spin> ANARCHY!!
*Silvermane Smirks. "Well if that's the case..." He glomps Fluttershy
<DecapKing> hey Fluttershy
<thunder-colt> durr
<KershaFangs> Loco in the coco
<SkyRings> *try to control excitation, impatence, and something*
<herospirit> Rainbow Dash, watch Bobobo sometime
<Skipsy> My apologies to those who were watching my stream, my interet had a super-derp.
<herospirit> It'll blow that out of the water
<Sumica> yeah it's not that echii Rainbow_Dash
<Nashy> yes
<Ziltoid> I love squids
<Silvermane> 15;D
<DecapKing> it seems you have found your way into the Bunker
<Filter> stream?
<Ziltoid> squids are my fetish
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi Denied_Existence
<Filter> what stream
<Spin> Is cool
<DecapKing> 4and hey PP
<Nashy> don't rely on pegasi D_D
<Denied_Existence> Hi Rainbow_Dash
<Skipsy> I was streaming me drawing ponies.
<Rainbow_Dash> She didnt find her way Decap, I let her in
<herospirit> That's nice, Ziltoid
<Rainbow_Dash> >.>
<Rainbow_Dash> Also, I am Pinkie_Pie, I will be using this nick for a while
<Filter> HotCocoa: You never talk as AtomicGone-y anymore
*Fluttershy is glomped, squeaks then laughs. ^^ "Hehe..."
<Spin> I hate waiting so much
<Filter> link? :)
<herospirit> squid rage
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<Sumica> perhaps nichijou would be good.
<Silvermane> why is that squid talking
<DecapKing> 4http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/132/d/f/who__s_ready_to_party_hard__by_johnjoseco-d3g7nbf.jpg I would be OK with this
<Skipsy> http://www.livestream.com/skipsysdoodles
<Skipsy> I'll be live in a second.
<Colgate> streams are too mainstream, I only watch creeks
<MrDrProfSgtLtBrony> hello?
<herospirit> because fuck physics
<Colgate> hihello
<Filter> Colgate: lol
<Ziltoid> oh dear
<HotCocoa> Filter: you mean AtomicBrony?
<Thunder_Dash> *silence*
<HotCocoa> And no, I don't.
<MrDrProfSgtLtBrony> so... what are we talking about?
<Colgate> you
<Filter> ja
<Silvermane> what the squid am I watching?
<Spin> I have to wait for s2 and my shirts to mail in must keep ponies contained.
<Fluttershy> FLCL then...? o-o
<MrDrProfSgtLtBrony> O_o
<herospirit> I've seen... 3 episodes, I think?
<Denied_Existence> 3I am tempted to RP right now...
<MrDrProfSgtLtBrony> >GET A GUN!
<Ziltoid> I am squidly confused
<Thunder_Dash> I haven't actually watched FLCL, one of my friends has told me repeatedly that it's bizarre, so :P
<Denied_Existence> 3But I don't know what or why...
<Sumica> then you have seen half of them
<MrDrProfSgtLtBrony> IN MY MOUTH!
<ShadTheCrazed> I'm gonna try to make RBD shirts this weekend.
<Spin> must see
<Sumica> So FLCL next then?
<herospirit> Sure
*Silvermane picks Fluttershy back up, dusting her off. "Sorry, I'm just, ermm, /friendly/ i suppose."
<johnsey> night all!
<ShadTheCrazed> Not to sell, though. I'm just slapping RBD's cutie mark on the shirt.
<herospirit> I still want some Bobobo on this stream someday.
<DecapKing> 4right, /friendly/
<Rainbow_Dash> inb4 someone orders squid
<ShadTheCrazed> Maybe find a red one and put Big Mac's Cutie Mark on it.
<Silvermane> mfw fastest shipping ever
<Spin> I would rep both of those pretty hard
<Fluttershy> Oh, it's okay. -doesn't get it- o-o
<Spin> Can't wait to get my Derpy hooves shirt and my gummy one okay all of em
<DecapKing> 4you would have to look through my mind to get it
<Sumica> who now Silvermane
*Silvermane is the shipping king >.>
<herospirit> what they say changes completely when you change the language on Bobobo. I guess it was because they just said "Fuck it this doesn't make sense just say whatever" anyways.
<Thunder_Dash> every time I hear someone say sorry in Japanese I immediately think of "USODA"
<thunder-colt> i want a spitfire shirt
<ShadTheCrazed> Maybe put Luna's cutie mark on a dark blue shirt.
<Silvermane> squid bitch and lemon shirt
<DecapKing> 4http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/193/c/d/let__s_get_louder_by_johnjoseco-d3nny9o.jpg
<DesertRose> gnight
<Sumica> lol
<thunder-colt> and a socks woona shirt
<Colgate> I have cutie mark pins
<Denied_Existence> ......0_o
<Mason_Trowel> I came to a realization
*Fluttershy 8hums quietly to herself.
<Colgate> so I can turn a non-brony shirt into a brony shirt in 10 seconds flat
<Mason_Trowel> There comes a point when you know you're in too deep.
<Spin> I had like 70$ to spend and my mom said I had to get jeans so instead of buying 40$ jeans I got like 5$ off ebay and got 4 MLP shirts :P
<Colgate> never
<Mason_Trowel> And that you can never go back
<ShadTheCrazed> We seriously need more Bronies in Tennessee. ;n;
<Colgate> never too deep! moar pony!
<Mason_Trowel> I decided to play a classic game
<Plorf> This amuses me.
<Plorf> http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/files/2011/06/AmericanAtheists-550x329.jpg
*DecapKing 4just sits there and hums "Wait and Bleed" to himself
<Mason_Trowel> One of my favorites of all time
<Colgate> Spin: that is what you do :D
<Mason_Trowel> Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
<Ziltoid> oh she mad
<Mason_Trowel> And then
*Silvermane shuffles off carefully, suddenly nervous. "Nope, nothing to see here, not a crazy fanboy or anything"
*Denied_Existence 3strums a guitar.
<Mason_Trowel> As I played, I thought...
<Thunder_Dash> and here I thought that was a bit of dirt on my screen, then it started flying
<Mason_Trowel> You know what this needs
<Mason_Trowel> ?
<Fluttershy> 8Mmmm! I got a piece of spice cake with my dinner and I'm so glad I did. It's delicious! ^^
<Mason_Trowel> PONY
<Colgate> also, rum & coke, I have missed you so much
<Spin> Plorf: I don't understand.
<Denied_Existence> 3~Decaps been shipping, with mares all day~
<Plorf> Basically
<ShadTheCrazed> EVERYTHINV NEEDS MORE PONY.
<Denied_Existence> 3~Will his mind continue to stay?~
<Filter> ^
<Plorf> American Atheists is a thing led by David Silverman
<JackiePie> moar
<Spin> ^
<HaysforPonies> What is a pony?! A miserable pile of friendship!
<ShadTheCrazed> *everything
<Silvermane> wow
<DecapKing> 4sadly, probably not
<Denied_Existence> 3~I may know, but its a conspiracy~
<Ziltoid> IVE SEEN ENOUGH HENTAI
<Plorf> Who is the origin of the memetic face
<Silvermane> inb4 the genre changes
<Mason_Trowel> *miserable LITTLE
<Spin> Oh I didn't know that
<herospirit> Lol :p
<Mason_Trowel> So many people forget that word
<Filter> cept for scootaloo
<Denied_Existence> 3~Shipping is awesome...I mean seriously~
<Plorf> http://noplan.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dave-silverman.jpg
<ShadTheCrazed> We need to ponyify Bayonetta. THAT IS FINAL, FILLIES.
<Spin> okay...*processing* lol
<herospirit> You always expect it but it never happens.
<Filter> shes just misserable
<HaysforPonies> Hayonetta
<Plorf> And they accepted that meme and put it on their door
<Fluttershy> 8brb again sorry! ><
<Silvermane> Mmmm, cake
<thunder-colt> Hay, I'm a colt, not a filly.
<DecapKing> 4actually that would be pretty fun to lose my mine....
*Silvermane waves bye to Fluttershy
<SkyRings> leaving, that was just a short visit
<DecapKing> 4*mind
<Denied_Existence> 3Your mine?
<SkyRings> good night
<DecapKing> 4it would suck to lose my mine
<thunder-colt> gnight
<Spin> We are all Brony here
<Spin> Night
<DecapKing> 4cause then someone would get blown up probably
<Silvermane> dat sound effect
<Denied_Existence> 3Why would it be fun to lose your mind?
<Silvermane> the wet squishing and flopping... *shudder*
<KershaFangs> I'm a hony.
<DecapKing> 4it would make things interesting
<KershaFangs> Or a pega-sis
<Ziltoid> RAPE FACE
<herospirit> I don't remember which episodes are in the first... uh.... episode
<Ziltoid> lol wut
<herospirit> they mispelled "cannon"
*Silvermane lost it years ago, so he replaced it. It doesn't fit, but it's still useful
<Sumica> to the moon?
<Thunder_Dash> > moon cannon
<Spin> I don't like making a seperate term for females ponies.
<Mason_Trowel> Oooh, my DL is done. ^_^
<Filter> We call them normal
<Spin> haha
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Working Celestia Moon Canon in Minecraft (http://tinyurl.com/3aw773d)
<Silvermane> lol
<ShadTheCrazed> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV2vfWUFtJ8&feature=related
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Stu Pierces The Heavens At 4 In the Morning
<Denied_Existence> 3So....we doing any RP'ing today for any reason?
<ShadTheCrazed> We need to take this scene, and put it with ponies.
<KershaFangs> So femailes should just be lumped together with a male term?
<DecapKing> 4besides it would give me a reason to wear my gasmask i used for halloween for that one year more often
<HaysforPonies> That cannon needs a "On the mooooon" soundbite.
<KershaFangs> You just jelly that I'm a peg-sis
<Denied_Existence> 3 0_o
<Spin> Umm yeah its called equallity
<DecapKing> 4what?
<Silvermane> wow, it even took him to the moon
<thunder-colt> Mmmmmbananas?
<herospirit> She is not just busy, she is squiddly busy
<Lysiria> I've heard "pegasister" rather than "peg-sis"
<KershaFangs> Equality doesn't lean towards bros.
<Silvermane> I am toats hitting on this Fluttershy gel
<KershaFangs> I have heard of pegasis, but I would rather say pegasister.
<herospirit> REALLY? I knew there was a moon portal mod, I bet they took the moon part from that
<Spin> brony originates from /b/
<Filter> In all fairness Brony is generally not thought of in a postive light
<Luna> 07>mfw squidvade
<KershaFangs> The subtle pun in pegasis is lost in speaking
<KershaFangs> Brony was using in /co/ before /b/
<PK_Away> I never liked the term brony
<Ziltoid> silly
<Thunder_Dash> > conquer the chairs and tables
<Ziltoid> this anime is silly
<Thunder_Dash> ...What?
<JackiePie> This is the sound that show go with being mooned, the moon singing "You've been moooonnneed" like in this YouTube.
<JackiePie> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m17I0filMLU
<herospirit> Lol, the translation I first watched of this took out all of her "squid" interjections
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about You Just Got Mooned!
<DecapKing> 4just like you did on Nightmare Moon
<Ziltoid> yay
<Spin> There is no point it splitting up based on gender
<Mason_Trowel> Hey, Hasbro used it in Equestria Girls, so I don't think they believe it is a solely negative moniker
<Spin> IMo
<Silvermane> hey hey hey, just because I loved her until she randomly frenched me...
<Silvermane> yes just like nightmare moon
<DecapKing> 4and kind of like Princess Molestia
<Thunder_Dash> Haha, oh wow this show
<Rainbow_Dash> Shes not very smart..
<Silvermane> Actually Molestia came onto me
<Spin> anyone here watch regular show

<Mason_Trowel> Can't say that I do, SPin
<Silvermane> well...

<herospirit> Ika Masume doesn't always Derp
<herospirit> but when she does
<Silvermane> i may not have been drunk, but...
<DecapKing> 4unless DE drugged me like he did last night....
<herospirit> she also Herps
<HaysforPonies> Bunch of baby ducks. Send them to the moon~
<KershaFangs> There's no need but I would still like to be allowed to.
<KershaFangs> Just to say, "I'm a hoeny for ponies."
<Denied_Existence> 3Wasn't me.
<thunder-colt> LOL hays
<Ziltoid> dat violin
<DecapKing> 4well then it must of been the vodka

<Spin> Okay well I heard it was good and seen it on CN a little so I watched the first episode and it got away with saying "(characters name) is gonna be pissed" idk if thats like an uncut version or what
<Spin> Haha I love that
<Spin> Hay

<HaysforPonies> Yes. The show is actually PG so they swear a little.
<DecapKing> 4oh and also with MirthTinker Silvermane
<HaysforPonies> Which surprised me.
<KershaFangs> They didn't "get away" with it. That's h9ow the show is.
<Spin> Hmm I was just wondering cause I was like wait did he jsut say that?
<KershaFangs> "DOn't look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches."
<Rainbow_Dash> Silvermane left

<redd> i finished coraline today
<herospirit> Lex Luther stole 40 pies
<redd> it was a very short yet good read
<redd> i liked it
<herospirit> that's as much as four tens
<Spin> Part of my schools new one you can choose english classes by genre like mine is Dark Days: Dystopian Enlgish
<herospirit> and that's terrible
<Sumica> Night Ziltoid
<KershaFangs> I have The Awakening to read... I feel like the lamest one here
<herospirit> night, Ziltoid
<JackiePie> Interesting, it sounds like the J-Horror film Battle Royale
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Good night Ziltoid
<Silvermane> lawl
<redd> i wish there were more steampunk books
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Oh!
<herospirit> WHAT
<JackiePie> There's going to be a movie of it in 2012
<Silvermane> !!!
<Thunder_Dash> What?
<Sumica> boom
<herospirit> I THINK I LIKE THIS SHOW.
<Spin> So I get to read Farenhiet 451 .. again liek the 5th time
<Luna> 07WAT?!
<Silvermane> what. in. the. fuck.
<JackiePie> Darn, otherwise I'd tell you cheat, watch the movie. That's what I did, heh heh.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Oh, wrong anime
<Thunder_Dash> I... What the hell's going on?
<KershaFangs> I read that. Ray Bradbury is crazy.
<Silvermane> It's like something straight from Pinkie Pie's fanfic journal
<KershaFangs> Sci-fi writers are just... crazy
<JackiePie> Awesome crazy
<KershaFangs> I know, it's a good kind
<Sumica> This show is made of random, much like me
*Razyn_the_Pony 0is poker facing at the standard fare.
<herospirit> Guys... we write fanfics about Ponies, right?
<DecapKing> 4no, its terrible that this chat isnt as interesting as it could be
<JackiePie> Well, what's freaky is when the stuff they've discussed becomes reality.
<Silvermane> k?
<Sumica> dont go there herospirit
<herospirit> Do you think... Pinkie writes Bronystate fanfics?
<VioletVanilla> 6My train of mind goes SPLAT SPLAT
<Silvermane> Herospirit. Fund it
<VioletVanilla> 6Trainswreck? :'D?
<JackiePie> Like how Gattica was about genetic engineering, and now we're having to deal with the ethics involving genetic engineering now.
<Spin> Its good but I've read so many times because I move alot and all my schools feel like they should give it to my grade so I should just take the test now
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0herospirit: :0
<JackiePie> Gattaca
<Spin> brb food
<VioletVanilla> 6Look down, back up, the chat is now diamonds~
<herospirit> I have brought silence to the chat.
<JackiePie> It's all letters from the genome
<KershaFangs> I read this one sci-fi novel, Dead Girls, and they used the anatomic names for body parts and bones to describe a love scene
*Silvermane is now diamonds. It is hard to breathe
<herospirit> And deep thought.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Nu uh
<JackiePie> Interesting, I guess
<KershaFangs> It was NOT romantic... in the least bit
<JackiePie> lol
<DecapKing> 4is still the same earth pony from Stalliongrad he was before
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0I have. Muahaha
<JackiePie> I don't think you were their target market then.
<Thunder_Dash> I'm still here, I was just trying to make sense of this show
<Thunder_Dash> or of what I've seen, rather
<herospirit> What would Pinkie's Bronystate fanfics would be like?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Silvermane
<Rainbow_Dash> I can confirm what they would be like
<Sumica> Silvermane and every one else here
<KershaFangs> IT was young adult, but this scene... lemme copy it for you to see.
<Rainbow_Dash> They would be all about the many possible ends Val will eventually meet
<JackiePie> I don't want the mods to say you're going past PG
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<Silvermane> Razyn. what
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Silvermane getting laid, Ghosties getting hugged, SPAM TOOT ETC
<herospirit> ...wrong Pinkie, Dashie
*Silvermane approves of this
<KershaFangs> Oh this was the lead up. Nothing bad in the part I am referring to
<DecapKing> and DecapKing drinks vodka
<Rainbow_Dash> What do you mean by that?
<JackiePie> Okay
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Chekov's salmon
<Dashite> DID SOMEONE SAY TOOT?!
<Ghosties> 4Razyn, just what are you trying to say?
<Silvermane> TOOT
<Spin> Yep so far my favorite one has been the Giver
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0TOOT
<Silvermane> TOOT
<Thunder_Dash> TOOT
<Silvermane> TOOT
<herospirit> Wait, that's what we do alread- OH MY GOD WE ARE IN A FANFIC
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0TOOT
<Sumica> OTTO
<Silvermane> TOOT
<JackiePie> That was a good story, but creepy
<DecapKing> exactly herospirit
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0TOOT
<herospirit> STOP TOOT SPAM. WE ARE IN ONE OF PINKIE'S FANFICS.
<Dashite> Loading Tootspam.txt, firing at 20%
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Loli teacher
<Dashite> >_>
<Thunder_Dash> so lemme get this clear, we're talking about being in a fanfic while in a fanfic?
<KershaFangs> Her teeth scratched at my ear, and the thick pulse of her clockwork heart beat against my own. Her plasticky flesh warmed, grew tacky, its illusion of wantonness betrayed only by the rib-cage, hard as vat-grown steel, adhering to my solar plexus and imprinting its decal of black and blue. Breathless, I ran my hand down her hair, the crenellations of her spine, to settle upon her sacrum, the small trephination o
<Spin> I don't know as an aspiring artist it made me think of my child hood
<Thunder_Dash> Ficception?
<herospirit> THE MLP FIM SHOW IS JUST AN AUTHOR SELF INSERTION
<Dashite> Fanfiception
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0We are genre savvy
<DecapKing> eeeeyup
*Silvermane is in a fanfic... and wrote fanfics in this fanfic...
*Silvermane also starred in those fanfics
<herospirit> OH MY GOD. WHAT DO WE DO NOW
<KershaFangs> They are not doing anything naughty. At all.
<Rainbow_Dash> You know your doomed when Pinkie ties balloons to her body to get to you
<Rainbow_Dash> http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/gallery/29565956?offset=24#/d3f0rdm
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Pinkie Pie must be a master of inception
<JackiePie> Yeah you see, I'm pretty sure that book was aimed at Goths and Emos
<VioletVanilla> 6XDD
<Spin> Boring
<VioletVanilla> 6Breathe in diamonds~
<DecapKing> 4looks like you were wrong violet
<Spin> All you need for a good story is sex and violence
<herospirit> what the HELL do we do now
<Spin> and ponies
<DecapKing> 4as i still want some vodka
<Thunder_Dash> That's what I want to know
<herospirit> Everything we know is a lie
<JackiePie> Maybe also for med students, I dunno
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0I hate it when that happens
<Blums> just ponies actually
<Sumica> I realy wanted to startle you all with inception horn but I just couldn't do it.
<Silvermane> WAT
<Marshmelon> Hey
<herospirit> WAT
<Spin> *thinks of the combination of sex,violence and ponies*... nevermind
<Marshmelon> Who was writing the Barley Stalk fic?
<Thunder_Dash> I am so confused right now
<herospirit> WAAAAt
<^Stargazer> oh my god @ dev version of Dead Island animations
<Silvermane> WAT
*Marshmelon thinks of Spin
<Silvermane> mfw LYRA
<KershaFangs> It was set about 200 years in the future, when a virus turns girls into vampiric robots with supernatural powers at the emergent of puberty and then makes then immortal at that point.
*^Stargazer is hurting from laughter
<herospirit> SHUT UP EQD, YOU'RE JUST AN AUTHOR SELF INSERTION
<VioletVanilla> 6What does vodka have to do with diamonds? o:
<Marshmelon> KershaFangs: So it's like MLP?
<herospirit> oh no the sushi
<Marshmelon> ...kind of?
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Comic: Lyra to the Stars (http://tinyurl.com/3skfez9)
<Spin> Ya thats not my kind of book sounds like another one of those teen complex books never got into those.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Dat comic
<DecapKing> 4diamonds cant drink vodka
<Barry> Guys, if Elements of Gaming's description of Gears of War is anything to go by, I doubt I'll ever play it
<herospirit> OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOD
<DecapKing> 4and i want some
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0It touched my hear
<VioletVanilla> 6I have seen this before. . .
<Marshmelon> Like Ender's game, but stupid?
<Thunder_Dash> man, I go to check EQD for like, three seconds and get back to... I have no idea.
<KershaFangs> Well if MLP involved the battle with Nightmare Moon inside of Twilight's reproductive organs, yeah. Just like it.
<Colson> .
<Colson> wat
<herospirit> Geats of Wat is great
<DecapKing> 4so i am still the same Stalliongrad earthpony i was before
<herospirit> Gears of War*
<Spin> So its basically the exact same?
<redd> wat wat
<Marshmelon> ...reproductive organs?
<JackiePie> lol, the host of Dark Matters said "First, here's a man who was not born a genius."
<herospirit> Lol, Geats of Wat.
<Colson> do not want
<JackiePie> And that's special how?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0It's like a female version of Cromartie
<Marshmelon> What is Dark Matters?
<KershaFangs> The final battle was inside of the main robot vampire's uterus. Which she gets sucked into by looking into her bellybutton.
<JackiePie> It's a show on the Science Channel
<Marshmelon> Also, was it MrMooMoo who was writing the Barley Stalk fic?
<ReticentSmolder> who's using Mirth's name?!
<JackiePie> About experiments that went too far or went wrong
<KershaFangs> I am not making this up. That's why I read this book. It's crazy.
<JackiePie> Creepy stuff
<herospirit> What the fuck
<VioletVanilla> JAN
<VioletVanilla> KEN
<Marshmelon> I don't... I...
<VioletVanilla> POOOOOOOOOOOON~~~~
<Dashite> Huh?
<ReticentSmolder> oh also, HAI HAI
<herospirit> Oh, Thunder, we found out that the world is a lie.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Ohai RS
<Dashite> Hey
<Spin> Ya I'll stick to Ayn Rand and ELie Weisel
<Marshmelon> What is this? I'm pretty confident that I don't even.
<Rainbow_Dash> 13Btw Violet
<ReticentSmolder> but yeah...somepony is using Mirth's name
<DecapKing> 4what?
<Thunder_Dash> Well, yeah, I know about that, I meant the stream :P
<JackiePie> Elie Weisel, his books are great, but so sad
<KershaFangs> THe Wiesel is a cool guy.
<Marshmelon> I accidentally ALL the vampire uterus.
<JackiePie> Now you've made me baww
<herospirit> Ooooh.
<DecapKing> 4hey person i dont know
<Rainbow_Dash> 13You couldnt ban me for such a ridiculous reason anyway, you would lose your job =P
<Dashite> You mean someone else registered it or something?
<Marshmelon> Is that dangerous?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Where is Mirth?
<ReticentSmolder> no, just someone online with it
<Marshmelon> Okay, I'm done, sorry.
<^Stargazer> woo, Lyra stargazes as well =)
*Fluttershy 8is back again and hugs Silvermane first this time. ^^
<Spin> Ya but I kinda like dark books for some odd reason maybe its the emo in me
<Dashite> Where?
*ReticentSmolder thinks Razyn is slow on the uptake
<Spin> But I use ponies to counter that
<Marshmelon> -___(\
<Marshmelon> What.
<JackiePie> Well it's fine, but with Elie Weisel that was real.
<DecapKing> 4hey Fluttershy
<KershaFangs> I love terrible stories and badly written/absolutely insane plots.
<VioletVanilla> 6I was just kidding Rainbow_Dash
<Marshmelon> "the emo in me"
<JackiePie> I mean it's fine if it's fake
<ReticentSmolder> you do realize...why I would know if someone is using Mirth's name and she's not on right?
<Spin> Ya I know

<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Ohai Mirthtinker
<KershaFangs> I had the whole Dead trilogy but lost my book. I was so sad... The second book starts off with a 15 comma long sentence. I knew it was going to be amazing
<Marshmelon> Huh. Not the one I was thinking of.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11Where though?
<VioletVanilla> 6;3 I would not do that to you dear~
<MirthTinker> I think I ghosted into chat and didn't connect at first

<JackiePie> Why it make you mad Spin?
<Rainbow_Dash> 11Not sure why pink
<VioletVanilla> 6and I know, I would not do such a thing
<KershaFangs> The series of Unfortunate Events looks like a Series of Simple Sentence compared to the Dead triology
<Marshmelon> lol

<Fluttershy> 8That's a first... o-o

*Sumica waits for reaction
<VioletVanilla> 6@Fluttershy. . . Yellow is a bit bright .~. Do whatever colour you wish though

<Natleyn> SWEET.
<Blums> dont link steamy ponies here D=
<Mongoose> I suggest you hold yourself from clicking steamyponies
<Spin> I don't think so
*Applejack can't resist Fluttershy cuteness and hugs her
<Denied_Existence> 3Your coolness level has increased by 15%
<Silvermane> Hey, that anime i need to finish still
<Fluttershy> 8o-o I have a new glompee in the BronyState tab...
<DecapKing> 4mainly cause there was some type of neurotoxin leak

<Mongoose> I've only tried Hulu
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Cowboy Bebop?
<Spin> * *click*
<Ghosties> 4It's Cowboy Bebop, man
<Sumica> Cowboy Bebop
<MirthTinker> 13and that spell is really hard
*Fluttershy is hugged by Applejack, blinks, then is rescued by Silvermane e-e oh dear
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Yep
<CogWeaver> and then suddenly
<DecapKing> 4i would never glomp you Fluttershy
<Ghosties> 4One of the most awesome, bad ass animes ever conceived
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0I could tell. I dunno how.
<Sumica> Not sure if sub or dubed.
*MirthTinker 13covers mouth at sudden innuendo
<mexican> its just that its starting here this week, and was wondering wether to hire it or not
<Fluttershy> 8o-o Alright. That's good to hear
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11...
<Silvermane> I'm not obsessed or anything
<Baz> Epic intro is epic
<Mongoose> I should hide before one of the mods hurt me
<Applejack> sorry...i didn't have a good childhood
<mexican> if it had ponies it wouldnt be a hard choice
<Denied_Existence> 3*Bum bum, tisch*
*Applejack starts crying
<VioletVanilla> 6Am I wrong for knowing this on all of my instruments? o:
<Dashite> Razyn seems to be having trouble speaking.
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanilla
<Silvermane> It's okay Applejack, i'm sorry
*Thunder_Dash hugs Applejack
<MourningStar> 12Reticent, I think they forgot about us
*Silvermane hugs Applejack. "No tears"
<Spin> umm ya just was in Steamyponies...
*Applejack cries even harder cuz of english mispellin
*VioletVanilla hugs Natleyn back. c:
<DecapKing> 4i didnt
*ReticentSmolder 5nods "probably"
<CogWeaver> so us singing Bohemian Rhapsody earlier made me think of the Muppets version of the song...
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11We always forget about Reticent. He's reticent.
*Applejack feels a bit better
<Dee> is there a PS3 bronies?
<Applejack> <=3
*BrokenWind walks up to Fluttershy
<DecapKing> 4i truly stopped caring as i am apathetic
*Denied_Existence 3glomps MourningStar! "OH WHY WOULD I FORGET ABOUT YOU!?"
<Dee> are*
<Razyn_the_Pony> 11By nature that happens
<CogWeaver> ...which in turn made me want a Pony version of the song, in the same way as the Muppets singing it
<Silvermane> >.> She seemed to like it earlier
<Ghosties> 4It's ok AJ. I know how conflicted you were with being raised on a farm and wanting a city life
<Sumica> And I will try to confugure YT at some point to work with my streaming. need to set up a play list or something so I am not having to search on stream.
<BrokenWind> So how ya doing?
*Fluttershy looks at BrokenWind, blinks. "Yes?"
<Spin> should of thought what "steamy" meant
<CogWeaver> not just a PMV
<Applejack> :,C
*Silvermane 15ignores innuendo
<herospirit> Is this... a Film Noir anime?
<Octavia> Spin, eeyup.
*Fluttershy smiles. "Oh. Very good thank you." ^^
*Silvermane 15considers this situation
<mexican> iÂ´ll watch it
<ReticentSmolder> 5she's mai waifu and you can't have her! *goes off to make a pony image of her to gloat*
<Blums> I always assumed it was a steamroom. I HATE moister
<herospirit> Film Noir styled :0
<Blums> so I'll never go there
*Silvermane 15pulls a scroll out of hammer-space
<Blums> *moisture
<VioletVanilla> 6It is a freaking good anime is what it is <3
<Fluttershy> 8I like it alright. But too much is... too much >_<
<Ghosties> 4It has some film noir
<Silvermane> 15Did you know I had hammer-space, MirthTinker?
<Denied_Existence> 3SILVERMANE USED INGNORE, ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE
<AceAttorney-Applejack> Eh?
<Ghosties> 4But it's mostly just a bad ass show
<DecapKing> 4yeah, but im an earth pony, not a pegasus
<mexican> blums, is the sky still weird?
*BrokenWind smiles back. "Have seen you since you fell out of fight school."
<Mongoose> which reminded me of the fact that the glee version is more popular on Spotify
<Spin> Well I saw steam and thought TF2
*CogWeaver dumps a whole water-tower on top of Blums*
<Blums> yes
<Baz> Spacerings
<herospirit> Film Noir and badass are nearly synonyms
<Fluttershy> I can only think of two animes about cowboys and space... this and Trigun.]
<VioletVanilla> 6XD DecapKing. . .
<Dee> I hate moisture too, it causes my books to get all.... wavy
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0"I just move like water"
<Blums> its blue and dusky-ora-
<MirthTinker> 13is there hammer space-time? does it operate on the principles of groovatility?
<Mongoose> I like moisture
<Denied_Existence> 3Sorry, that happens too...
<Mongoose> It keeps me nice and cool
*Razyn_the_Pony 0is bad with quotes
<mexican> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<mexican> yes
<Silvermane> True. I'm pretty light on my hooves, not to mention I can prevent ground collisions.
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps mexican
<Spin> I like water not moisture I hate humidity
*Fluttershy pauses, tilts her head. "I... I don't recognize you, I'm sorry..."
*VioletVanilla hears dub
*Blums stands stiff, wide eyed, blinking rapidly
*Mongoose jumps in the Equestriadaily pool
*VioletVanilla does not know how to react
<CogWeaver> we have a pool?
<CogWeaver> since WHEN??
<Octavia> Spin, if you have a mental filter, the normal rp is good. i ignore the rest.
<Blums> We do now apparently
*Fluttershy 8falls over onto her back with a squeak. e.e
<Applejack> at first i thought this was Samurai Champloo, that guy looked like Mugen
<Ghosties> 4Wut
*Blums shakes all the water off
<Natleyn> Dub isn't THAT bad
<Mongoose> Since nome
<Ghosties> 4Are you kidding...this dub is excellent
<CogWeaver> nome?
<ShadTheCrazed> Guys, when someone discriminates Bronies, we need to do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxVEkb69AGQ&feature=related
<DecapKing> 4that cant be good
<mexican> *jumps into the pool too*
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0It is
<Sumica> one of the better dubs
<CogWeaver> there's not place like nome?
<VioletVanilla> 6Samurai Champloo is made by the same people who did this.
*Silvermane 15hands MirthTinker the scroll. "Single use, and it should give you the /desired/ results"
<ShadTheCrazed> Rolf: Have you brought the cupcakes of sorryness?
<Mongoose> Yes
*Spin stands still for a few seconds in the pool, looks around nervously and slowly swims away.
<ShadTheCrazed> >cupcakes
<Dee> Its got a Jacuzi that pours, "Into" the pool
<VioletVanilla> 6I was actually saying. . . I like this dub. . .
<herospirit> Bell Peppers and... Bell Peppers
<Mongoose> The other RPs are non serious
<Applejack> that explains, Thanks yall kahdly, sugarcube
<Mongoose> Maybe we don't have brains
<BrokenWind> It's okay. I never really said 'Hi' to you.
<Mongoose> but we have fun
*CogWeaver sits relaxing in the jacuzi*
<VioletVanilla> 6Spike's voice <3
<Ghosties> 4I actually wanted to try bell pepper and beef after watching this
<Mongoose> and that's what RPing is about
<Mongoose> or something
*Silvermane scoops up the stunned fluttershy, righting her. "You alright Shy-Shy? Talk to me, i'm a trained emergency medic."
<Spin> doesn't help first line I see is THAT
<mexican> y is the pool warmer now?
<CogWeaver> because of the jacusi
<Applejack> wait...why dat "Cowboy" on the title?
<Silvermane> Ghosties. It is full of ugh
*Denied_Existence 3watches with amusement.
<CogWeaver> *jacuzi
<Fluttershy> 8I... I'm fine... just scared myself... ^^;
<Blums> I dropped a depth charge into it
<Sumica> It's great,Ghosties has to be stur fri though
*Mongoose relaxes next to CogWEaver
<Mongoose> Hey
<Octavia> Spin, honestly, i would just not go there because you will see a lot of /that/
<Blums> dont worry, i made sure nopony would get hurt
*Denied_Existence 3takes a sip from his flask.
<Mongoose> CogWeaver*
*DecapKing 4just sits there, drinking his vodka
<Fluttershy> stuffed bell peppers are really yummy
<VioletVanilla> 6I would make you some Ghosties~
<Spin> Well I'll sit here and just chill in the pool
<Applejack> this anime doesn't have ANY Cowboys....
<Ghosties> 4Aw, thanks Violet :3
<Blums> Hey that reminds me, I should continue that fic!
*Razyn_the_Pony 11wonders what is wrong with his friends
*CogWeaver gets up out of the Jacuzi*
<Dee> i dislike the Rping in pony tumblrs, alwas seems... angry
<ShadTheCrazed> And once we get the anti-brony love and tolerated the crap out of:
<CogWeaver> nope.avi
<Ghosties> 4AJ, you're in for a surprise
<VioletVanilla> 6n.n
<Baz> Is this the first episode?
<Sumica> cowboy = bounty hunter.
*Silvermane sighs. "Oh okay. Don't worry me like that. No becoming a tree via alternate routes now."
<BrokenWind> I want more clips
<Sumica> yes
<ShadTheCrazed> "THE TRIBE OF MY FELLOW BRONIES HAS BEEN AVENGED! Thanks for all the ponies."
<mexican> brb

<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Ghosties> 4First ep
<Octavia> Spin, giving some insight. do what you will, just be respectful.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0I always wondered, if they are so broke, how can they afford the resources for this stuff?
<Silvermane> 15Razyn, many things
<Mongoose> That is not nice!
<Baz> Alright
<MirthTinker> 13yfw you've used the basic plot for every futa hentai out there
<Ghosties> 4Good first ep at that
<Baz> Magic
*VioletVanilla has the entire soundtrack of this.
<Fluttershy> 8I suppose that wouldn't be very good, true... though sometime in the future I would like to be a tree, at least for a bit... -blushes-
<Sumica> ^second
*Applejack is surprised
*Ghosties 4has this show on DCD
<Ghosties> 4*DVD
<Dee> Mongoose... do you own a Mongoose... "Bike"
<Silvermane> Razyn, same way a broke guy can afford to drive a car and have internet
*VioletVanilla does as well~
<Mongoose> No
<Denied_Existence> 3MFW Emerald likes to RP with me more than anything, yet is only my friend IRL..
<Dee> heh
<Mongoose> I don't own a bike
*Razyn_the_Pony 11can attest to what Mirth said
<Mongoose> My username is based off the animal
<Sumica> Any one getting lag spikes?
<Spin> Ya people have their preferences I am all tolerance and the like
<Ghosties> 4Great, now I want tomato juice
<Mongoose> Spin
<Mongoose> The AD RP is full of sex and violence
<Silvermane> 15MirthTinker... *shudder*
<Silvermane> 15Also, it will give you wings
<Mongoose> the #PonyRp is not
<BrokenWind> Fluttershy: Anyways, I go by "BrokenWind"
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0No lag

<Mongoose> It's more for beginning Rpers
<mib_v065de> egh
<Fluttershy> I really like carrot juice
<Fluttershy> o-o
<CogWeaver> yes, Dee
<Mongoose> and I have no clue about the #BucketofHolding
<CogWeaver> he's not a pony
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Dem boobies
<DecapKing> 4wings seem to be over rated
*Denied_Existence 3wonders how Silvermane knew about his Red Bull stash...
<mib_v065de> Kick Natleyn and Natleyn2, please? Chrome crashed. Twice
<Applejack> hmmm
<CogWeaver> he's a Chimera or something
<Xiagu|PastSins> he's male

<Ghosties> 4I love the way how he says that
<Baz> What was that stuff
<Applejack> okay...that was awsome...
<Sumica> Me thinks BrokenWind is not a fan.
*Silvermane nuzzles the embarrassed Fluttershy. "It's a cute dream, to say the least. Relax Shy-Shy."
<BrokenWind> (Gotta go need to make dinner cya.)
<Ghosties> 4Keep watching AJ
<Applejack> and i still think that guy looks like Mugen
*VioletVanilla is melting at Spike's voice
*Mongoose coughs violently
<VioletVanilla> 6Correction AJ, Mugen looks like Spike
*Rainbow_Dash 11is watching how Silvermane seems to be quickly finding herself a new RP partner
<ShadTheCrazed> I need a picture of that guy wearing a FLuttershy shirt with the captions: MANLY

<Dee> and anger
<ReticentSmolder> 5so you like earth ponies like AJ?
<Sumica> heardmind Ghosties
<Plorf> ShadTheCrazed: Care to go on?
<Silvermane> 15Unicorns with their magic, earth ponies with strength, griffons in general...
<ShadTheCrazed> * Joins: GreatAndAllPowerful
<VioletVanilla> 6Do you know how much YOU are worth?? :D?
<Polarfire> ohai Violet
<ShadTheCrazed> Plorf: I dunno. Should I ask him if he's a Brony?
<herospirit> He DOES look ridiculous
<atomic7732> hahaha
<Denied_Existence> 3And pegasi?
<Polarfire> you found mah bunker >_>
<DecapKing> 4im not a fan of being with griffions, the last one i dated is still stalking me....
<VioletVanilla> . . . Is there something I should know?
<VioletVanilla> o:
<Silvermane> 15although I like having an easy job guessing the weak point, so unicorns are preferred.
<Plorf> I mean, unless you don't know him very well
<Plorf> why not
<MirthTinker> 13so...you'd like me less if I were a pegasi? *sniff*
*Denied_Existence 3is a pegasus, and is quite annoyed at this.

<Polarfire> nah. We made this the other day when all the pouncing was going on... and never really left.
<herospirit> FWAP
<VioletVanilla> 6Oh 'tay~ :3
<Spin> Just ask him "Who is best pony?" you'll find out fast enough
<Silvermane> 15MirthTinker, it just wouldn't be as interesting if you were a pegasus. Of course, then you'd know ALL about how to control me via wings
<ShadTheCrazed> How I think I know is because of this:
<GLaDOS> Hey everyone, I'm just wondering, what is this weekend's movies?
<herospirit> We really need some batman sound cues up in here
<ShadTheCrazed> Spin: GOOD IDEA!
<Octavia> so, they are selling it.
*Razyn_the_Pony 11is a unicorn and is still wondering why everypony here is crazy

<Silvermane> 15anyways, MirthTinker, come here. Since you seem using my wings against me, I though I'd show you what, how, and why
<DecapKing> 4you try having an insane griffon stalk you for 5 years and not be paranoid
*MirthTinker 13glares at him
<herospirit> Why is this whole movie in trippy 60's Technicolor
<Kad> I blow up buildings too.... in sim city

<Spin> If I were you I would refer to myself as Persian sounds ..nicer
<MirthTinker> 13how do I know you aren't going to take advantage of me again?
<FlutterWhat> herospirit is awesome.
<Keyframe> Alright then
<Natleyn> Sounds like he needs hugs.
<herospirit> Is that shocking?
<Kad> Mongoose if I said, time free booze, you'd say?
<Spin> like the cat
<Silvermane> 15What lie did I tell?
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<DecapKing> 4want me to beat his plot for you Mirth?

*Denied_Existence 3takes off and hovers in the air.
<VioletVanilla> 6BRING HIM DOWN!
<herospirit> Is this really the first thing I've complained about in here? :0
<DecapKing> 4so is that a yes, no, maybe?
<Mongoose> When I say Persian I think Yusif Amir
<Vakie> Say what to the play that just hovered down to land o.O
*Silvermane 15smiles. "Yes, they suit you very well."
<Silvermane> 15I think she's okay boys

<FlutterWhat> OMG i just realized how much i actually hate daft punk
<herospirit> Unz unz unz unz
<FlutterWhat> because of this song
*Silvermane 15rolls his eyes. "She always does."
<Vakie> *nods head*
<Silvermane> 15In the mean time...
<Mongoose> Yusif Amir = Sweaty Rich Persian who enjoys Hookers and Clubbing
<herospirit> I like this song. :0
<Keyframe> I think I'm gong to decide on... The 20% cooler shirt...
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Harder better faster stronger
<Keyframe> and the drinking deck cards >:3
<DecapKing> 4but i could beat him right now, and it would give me a purpose to do something right now....
<FlutterWhat> this song is the most overplayed POS in the entirety of space and time
<Natleyn> I've heard it repeatedly too often during long car trips. Otherwise, I like it.
<herospirit> But this movie is freaking me the FUCK out.
<Dashite> The most? Not even close...
<DecapKing> 4besides kill my liver
*Silvermane 15places a hoof in the crook between Tink's wings, placing pressure. He knows this most typically causes the knees to give out slowly, depending on the willpower of the pegasus in question
<FlutterWhat> Kanye west's INSTERMENAL made it a bit better
<FlutterWhat> ]hate his lyrics
<Mason_Trowel> /)^3^(\ <--- Smooshy face for all of you. XD
<Thunder_Dash> I don't mind it, but it's not my favorite
<FlutterWhat> ok
*MirthTinker 13feels...nothing
<FlutterWhat> maybe not the most
<FlutterWhat> but i dislike this song
<MirthTinker> 13um Silver...what are you doing?
<Keyframe> Oh thats what that emote means....
<Silvermane> 15hmm?
<Silvermane> 15that's odd
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Haters gonna hate
<BrokenWind> so they just rewrite his brain like a tape?
<Ali1017> No, that's the dash face.
<MirthTinker> 13I've never used those muscles before >.>
<FlutterWhat> <3i luff being the hater
<FlutterWhat> wat
<DecapKing> 4if i remember correctly, that is a pressure point
*Xiagu|PastSins /)^Îµ^(\
<herospirit> LOL WAT.
<FlutterWhat> are they going to humans now
<Silvermane> 15but it shouldn't matter... it's the nerves that causes reactions
*Razyn_the_Pony 0activates the endless dowflow of sunglasses
<Silvermane> 15hrmm
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Deal with it
*Denied_Existence 3falls to the ground...spasming...
<Fluttershy> I prefer this version to the Kanye West version...
<DecapKing> 4well that was fun
<Silvermane> 15huh. Sympathetic psycho-somatic symptoms over there
<CogWeaver> /)^3^(\ SO. AWESUM!
<Keyframe> Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight
<FlutterWhat> mot hipster glasses = failure
<Thunder_Dash> the guy with the Afro reminds me of one of the guys out of Yakitate!! Japan, haha
<herospirit> The Kanye instrumental was cool. The lyrics ruined it
<FlutterWhat> ^that
<VioletVanilla> 6D:
*MirthTinker 13wonders what Empathetic psycho-somatic symptoms would look like :P
<VioletVanilla> 6SCOOT SCOOTALOOOOO~
<DecapKing> 4what does all that mumbo jumbo mean?
<Denied_Existence> 3dude...........
<herospirit> Owait. I think I know where this is going
<Natleyn> ^<3
<herospirit> "ALL OUR MUSICIANS ARE ALIENS"
<FlutterWhat> ^<4
<Keyframe> Hmm this is awkward... I can't remember my shirt size xD
<CogWeaver> just say large
<Silvermane> 15owell, what I was doing is usually useful for dropping a pegasus to the ground for various reasons. Naturally, if they resist it's easy to get away from
<FlutterWhat> AERTH NEEDS GOOD BANDS
<FlutterWhat> EARTH NEEDS GOOD BANDS
<Keyframe> Yea?
<Sumica> bingo well part right h
<Vakie> Very
<Keyframe> You calling me fat?
<Denied_Existence> 3I....think you fucked.....up...that spell....
<Mason_Trowel> I said smooshy face because that's how Bronyville are referring to it in their podcast.
<CogWeaver> and then find ways to make it shrink if it's too large
<DecapKing> 4i would agree
*Denied_Existence 3twitches
<FlutterWhat> is that the first doctor?
<CogWeaver> well they're wrong, Mason
<CogWeaver> it's obviously the Dash face
<CogWeaver> obviously
<Keyframe> Let's see I'm 5'10'', 155 lbs
<DecapKing> 4i wonder if this would help....
<Silvermane> 15DecapKing, means someone feels something because they feel sympathy for another in some way. like leg pain when someone breaks their leg
<Sumica> lol kind looks like em
<MirthTinker> 13but what if I just haven't opened up the nerves in my wings? I mean, they didn't exist just a few minutes ago, what if its a delayed reaction to the magic?
<Plorf> I'm really lanky
<FlutterWhat> lol
<Plorf> 6'10", 135
*DecapKing 4kicks Denied_Existence in the ribs
<FlutterWhat> there was this awesome fake anime
<Thunder_Dash> Wow, can't unsee now. xD
<herospirit> The drummer's face has become less retarded, slightly
<Vakie> Zombified expression
<DecapKing> 4did that help at all?
<Denied_Existence> 3Oof.
<FlutterWhat> of one of the doctors in japan
<Spin> 5'6 135
<Blums> Nightmarity
<Silvermane> 15hmm, true, but there are several things I can show you right now that are pure physics
<FlutterWhat> it had the same sort of style of this
<FlutterWhat> it was
<Denied_Existence> 3*Wheeze* nope...
<FlutterWhat> So
<FlutterWhat> amazing
<DecapKing> 4oh
<Mason_Trowel> 5'6" 137 myself
<DecapKing> 4well sorry that i probably broke your rib
<Mason_Trowel> We almost the same, Spin
<Mason_Trowel> :P
*Plorf AND THEN EVERYBODY DESCRIBED THEIR MEASUREMENTS
<MirthTinker> 13so...your inherent kinks as a pegasus are physics? *snickers*
<Denied_Existence> 3Ouch...
<Spin> Close Enough *brohoof*
<Mongoose> 5'10 133
<Silvermane> 15... yeah sure why not.
<DecapKing> 4just walk it off DE
*Mason_Trowel brohoofs
<Silvermane> 15for instance...
*Denied_Existence 3twitches.
<Plorf> speaking of not measurements
<Plorf> I have to get some sleep
<Skipsy> http://i.imgur.com/u68k8.jpg
<^Stargazer> 5'10
<Plorf> goodnight, everyone
<DecapKing> 4am i going to have to call a whambulance?
<CogWeaver> AND THEN THEY ALL
<CogWeaver> talked
<CogWeaver> >.>
<herospirit> This movie is drugs
<Denied_Existence> 3Yeah...
<FlutterWhat> lag is getting more and more frequent
*Silvermane 15clips a leather binding to the wing joints of MirthTinker, both connected to chains
<Keyframe> For a second I thought I was taller than you Mongoose.
<Nittany_Tiger> Finally home.
<Spin> G'night
<herospirit> But I don't know if it is drugs in a good way.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0>Octave
<Plorf> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Plorf!
<MirthTinker> 13wait, what is that?!
<Silvermane> 15you no longer can move in any direction
<Plorf> vooooom
<Keyframe> Then I realized, I suck at math.
<CogWeaver> night plorf
<Natleyn> Welcome, Nittany_Tiger :3
<Thunder_Dash> hi, Nittany
<Silvermane> 15not doing anything with it, just showing
<DecapKing> 4god you pegasi are weak
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0The keyboardist's name is Octave
<Nittany_Tiger> Hi.
*Denied_Existence 3gets up.
<Mongoose> I'm taller then someone!
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Hi Nittany
<herospirit> Welcome to the lion's den, Tiger
*Denied_Existence 3takes a sip from the flask.
<MirthTinker> 13I can still move my legs right?
<Keyframe> Same height
<Silvermane> 15try moving around. You'll find it's like trying to move away from your head
<Keyframe> I'm just fatter than you
<Nittany_Tiger> Or the pony's den. :p
<Spin> 5'6"
<DecapKing> 4way to colt the fuck up DE
<Pants_Dancer> Then I realized, Keyframe sucks at math.
<Silvermane> 15of course, but you will stop moving quickly
<FlutterWhat> ^<4
<Mongoose> Ah
<herospirit> Sumica is frying my brains, and I complained about something in here for the first time EVAR.
<Vakie> let the bobing of the head begin!
<Pants_Dancer> It's probably Mongoose's fault.
<MirthTinker> 13*trots forward, gets tugged back by her wings*
<MirthTinker> 13FREAKY!
<CogWeaver> so you are taller than him, Keyframe
*Denied_Existence 3splashes some Vodka into DecapKing's eyes.
<CogWeaver> just sideways
<Pants_Dancer> Speaking of which, I haven't seen Mongoose around here for a while.
<Silvermane> 15Eeyup.
<DecapKing> 4thanks
<Denied_Existence> 3Welcome.
<DecapKing> 4i actually needed that
<Keyframe> I have a gut, but nebraska gave me beefy arms
<Denied_Existence> 3....
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Aye captain!
*Silvermane 15unhooks MirthTinker. "Roll onto your back, this one's a little more... involved.
<Mongoose> I've been chatting in AD
<CogWeaver> !seen Mongoose
<DerpyBot> CogWeaver: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. Mongoose is in the channel.
<Keyframe> So I'm relatively slim
<CogWeaver> hrm
<CogWeaver> I think DerpyBot's broken
<Dee> i'm steadily loosing weight, in the form of Bicycling and refusing the Easy way out by getting lifts
<Mongoose> But I have been on here
<MirthTinker> 13wait...Silver, why do you happen to have leather binding equipment for wings on hand?
<MirthTinker> 13HOOF DAMNIT
<Sumica> Well this is sort of a trial run for my streaming capability too.
<CogWeaver> because she thinks Mongoose is here when he's obviously not
<MirthTinker> 13I MEANT HOOD
<Pants_Dancer> .__.
<Silvermane> 15Don't worry about it
<Spin> My body consists of gum its not fut or anything just kinda squishy and there
<MirthTinker> 13HOOF
<MirthTinker> 13SJUTUP
<Pants_Dancer> CogWeaver, you're kidding, right?
<Mongoose> Of course
<DecapKing> 4because he is an odd pony
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Pretty good!
*Denied_Existence 3retrieves his anatomy books from his saddlebags.
<Silvermane> 15shhh silly filly
<Denied_Existence> 3Hmm...
<Sumica> If you have all had enough I can move on to something else.
<^Stargazer> I think I'm gonna go to bed, night night fellow ponies
<Pants_Dancer> I missed his last line :3
<herospirit> Admit it Sumica, you just want to fry my brains :p
<Denied_Existence> 3I don't remember reading about this...
<Pants_Dancer> Good night, ^Stargazer!
<Spin> Night Stargazer
<CogWeaver> night Stargazer
<Dashite> That was only a nice bonus.
<Sumica> will make sure to put larger files on the primary drive
*^Stargazer stretches, waves good night and leaves out the door and heads home
<DecapKing> 4Silver, did you just call me a "silly filly"?
<MirthTinker> 13Silly, there's no wings on my belly
<Pants_Dancer> !Lullaby ^Stargazer
<Mongoose> Night ^Stargazer
<CogWeaver> !lullaby Stargazer
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Well, it's like two against twenty, so...
<Silvermane> 15course not. it's not something that is written down. like the old rule of 'control the head, control the body'
<Sumica> You caught me herospirit
<Mongoose> aww
<herospirit> :)
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Or 7 if you're only counting the active ones
<Silvermane> 15MirthTinker, I know. Just lie on your back, wings spread
<Pants_Dancer> Beat you to it, CogWeaver...
*Denied_Existence 3takes out a pen and scribble this into the book.
<FlutterWhat> whoop whoop~!
<CogWeaver> you also put the carrot on the name when I didn't
<Vakie> 3D pan effect!
<MirthTinker> 13...*does so* I feel like this makes me dirty :P
<herospirit> what? 2 against twenty for what?
<Pants_Dancer> Correct.
<Mongoose> You guys both lose
<Mongoose> He alreadly left
<Pants_Dancer> "I've got a golden ticket!"
<Sumica> vote to skip so to speak.
*CogWeaver puts a carrot in Mongoose's eye*
<Vakie> LEFT! LEFT! LEFT RIGHT LEFT!
<Mongoose> already*
<DecapKing> 4maybe its because im here?
*Pants_Dancer whistles
*Denied_Existence 3notes this in his psychology notes.
<HotCocoa> Whoa what
<HotCocoa> Hayfever
<FlutterWhat> LEFT
*Mongoose has a carrot in his eye
<FlutterWhat> LEFT
<Pants_Dancer> I've got a golden tickeet in my eyeeee!
<FlutterWhat> LEFT?
<herospirit> Gotcha. I don't overly care
<Keyframe> So................ Good news..... I finished my fanfic... I don't know why but 3000 words was tough on me
*Silvermane 15blushes slightly. "Well it is an interesting angle... but I promised demonstration only for now
<Vakie> Right hoof?
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0ALL THROUGH THE AIR
<CogWeaver> I really should get back to writing fics...
<FlutterWhat> ALL THOUGH THE AIR
<Cold_in_Gardez> 3000 words is a fair amount, if tightly written
<Pants_Dancer> Probabaly because you wrote it in twenty minutes?
<CogWeaver> hrm
<herospirit> My brains have melted several times, and they mostly reform each time
<HaysforPonies> I am like a third complete with mine.
<Keyframe> Then I decided f this I'm just going to animate it
<MirthTinker> 13Well, demonstrate away, not like I'm going anywhere without half my back
<CogWeaver> heh
<Sumica> DYNAMIC ENTRANCE!
<Thunder_Dash> I don't really care either, but I'm curious as to how this ends now, haha.
<FlutterWhat> "one more time" THATS WHAT YOU SAID LAST TIME
<Pants_Dancer> ...animate it?
<Keyframe> So now you'll all see my horrible Flash skills!
<Pants_Dancer> EW NO!@
<Hayfever> :)
*Hayfever tickles HotCocoa.
<Pants_Dancer> Lyra: Ew, Flash
<Mongoose> I'm still writing my fic
<CogWeaver> EW GA--I mean..um
*HotCocoa snuggles Hayfever
<herospirit> I wont get to see how it ends. :I
<HotCocoa> Haven't seen you in a while.
*Silvermane 15straddles MirthTinker across the midriff. "Watch carefully." He slides forward, leaning his hindlegs on her wings near the joint carefully
<HotCocoa> :P
*Pants_Dancer snuggles hayfries
<herospirit> Only have like 20 more minuets.
<Sumica> so would that make them the Blue man group?
<Vakie> SKY DIVE!
<Pants_Dancer> Hay, hayfries.
<Silvermane> 15The wings are very important to a pegasus
<DecapKing> 4what the hell am i watching?
<Pants_Dancer> I haven't seen you in my tummy.
<Vakie> freefall!
<Keyframe> If I had 3D models.... That were rigged. I would be using maya... but noOOooOOo... I have to draw.
*Hayfever was feeling tiny and donkey. What?
<Vakie> wait what o.O
*Pants_Dancer ohm nom nom nom.
<Silvermane> 15So the body will resist any attempt to move that may hard the wings
<herospirit> So far this has gotten better as it's gone, sooooo
<HotCocoa> S'cool.
<Dee> If they made background ponies similer to the Fanon characteristics, would you watch it more frequently?
<Thunder_Dash> Like I said earlier, what I'm getting out of this is "Avatar: Daft Punk Edition", so... yeah
<Silvermane> 15right now, your wings are pinned down. This makes it impossible to sit up
<Mongoose> MONGOOSE
<Hayfever> there are 3d models that are rigged
<Keyframe> KEYFRAME
<BrokenWind> ownage by new blue dude
<Pants_Dancer> They would only be there for like 2 seconds.
<CogWeaver> COGWEAVER
<Pants_Dancer> How could they be more like fanon?
<Mongoose> MONGOOSE SCOTT
<Pants_Dancer> GUMMY.
<herospirit> New blue dude = best blue dude
<Mongoose> GREAT MONGOOSE
<herospirit> From now on we will call him "Best Blue Dude"
*Mongoose IS SOON GOING TO BE YELLED AT
<CogWeaver> no
<Pants_Dancer> GUMMY USED GUM! IT'S SUPER-EFFECTIVE!
<Keyframe> I haven't looked hard hayfever. I found models. But I'm Really picky about rigs
<Natleyn> Gotcha.
<Vakie> ha, everybody is like: "what in the world just happened..."
<CogWeaver> just told to stop using caps
<BrokenWind> okay
<MirthTinker> 13...you better not get that close to my face with your colthood when I'm so bound and bothered
<CogWeaver> now
<Thunder_Dash> Well, that works for me, considering that this movie doesn't even have any dialogue in it! XD
<DecapKing> 4i am so confused by this
<Mongoose> ok
<Pants_Dancer> "Stop using caps, Mongoose"
<Silvermane> 15... umm...
<DecapKing> 4but oddly interested...
<Pants_Dancer> Darn, I was late.
<Hayfever> Keyframe, kpsquirrelsomethingsomething on da has mostof the 3d models and they are very pro
<FlutterWhat> ...Left
<Vakie> heyo!
<Natleyn> haah
<Pants_Dancer> Or... your "now" was early, CogWeaver.
<herospirit> The Black man who used to be a blue man is named "Afro"
<Vakie> LOL!
<BrokenWind> truck is just fine
<Vakie> night flutter
<FlutterWhat> Night?
<FlutterWhat> <3
<Vakie> *nice
<Keyframe> I think I downloaded from Squirrel... They were just the models.
<FlutterWhat> lolol
<Vakie> keyboard fail
<Mongoose> What Coggy says goes
<Vakie> :P <3
*Silvermane 15quickly gets up. "Remember to do that pin lightly, as it cuts off blood flow if you go too heavilly. Nerve damage may result if you go down to rough
<Keyframe> I didn't see a skeleton or handles anywhere
*CogWeaver is secretly a timetraveler and his definition of 'now' is always different from others' 'now'*
<MirthTinker> 13but, you /are/ the expert here
<FlutterWhat> u guise are besets friends
<FlutterWhat> jk
<Pants_Dancer> Yeah, but his "now" prediction skills suck.
<FlutterWhat> but i like everything you say
<Keyframe> Cogsworth
<Pants_Dancer> Oh... or that.
<Vakie> LOL @ THE GUARDS!
<herospirit> Hahaha the security guys are robots?
<CogWeaver> actually, I'm not secretly a timetraveler
<Hayfever> for maya? you have to turn on the boning
<Thunder_Dash> THE GUARDS ARE ALL TERMINATORS
<CogWeaver> I'm secretly a time-colonist
<FlutterWhat> FASHIONABLE
<Nittany_Tiger> Seen the new VGCats?
<CogWeaver> but SHH!!
<Dee> Colgate has perfect timing
<FlutterWhat> <3
<FlutterWhat> D:
<Pants_Dancer> You're revealed as a time traveler?
<Hayfever> works fantastic in blender
<Vakie> yea, we just got like. ran over by a damn truck. yet we look like we got sunburned...
<MirthTinker> 13that pin seems almost mean
<herospirit> I have not, Tiger
<Pants_Dancer> No longer secret?
<FlutterWhat> i havne't read VGcats for YEARS
<Sumica> yeah Nittany_Tiger
<BrokenWind> All this advanced tech and all they do is kidnap an alien band?
<Denied_Existence> 3It IS mean.
<Keyframe> You mean "Show bones"
*CogWeaver is secretly a time-colonist*
*Hayfever does not know maya well, prefers 3dsm or blender.
<Mongoose> According to Mongoose
<Keyframe> I don't have blender
<Mongoose> I am a time traveler
<DecapKing> 4want me to break his jaw MirthTinker?

<Denied_Existence> 3Us pegasi value our wings highly.
<Silvermane> 15It's intended to completely dominate the physical self. Useful for taking control in romantic situations and combat encounters alike
<Pants_Dancer> Mongoose lies, though.
<Mongoose> but Mongoose has been known to lie
<Keyframe> I time traveled once.
<Pants_Dancer> Called it.
<Dee> Can a blender blend itself?
<Mongoose> So I'm not sure if I beleive hi m
<FlutterWhat> 5

<Keyframe> yes
<FlutterWhat> 5
<FlutterWhat> 5
<FlutterWhat> 5
<Pants_Dancer> Only if you put it inside of itself
<Nittany_Tiger> Scott threw another pony reference. Seems to be a regular thing. I don't think the reference fits the comic.
<Mongoose> him*
*Denied_Existence 3fluffs his wing.
*Denied_Existence 3fluffs the other wing too.
<FlutterWhat> unless he draws ponies I'm not intrested
<FlutterWhat> lol
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0inb4 dat cameo
<Silvermane> 15Speaking of... Stand up now, carefully. Your blood may have pooled slightly.
<FlutterWhat> well
<FlutterWhat> i am
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, I read it, didn't really seem right to me either
<FlutterWhat> but he should draw ponies
<FlutterWhat> going to their site now lol
<Keyframe> So I'll look back into it. But the animation that I plan on doing is with OC characters... including the... Rule 63? The opposite gender of the main cast.
<Pants_Dancer> Need moar Lyra_as_Bugs_Bunny comics.
<Nittany_Tiger> That would be cool.
<Pants_Dancer> !link Lyra_as_Bugs_Bunny
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<Nittany_Tiger> A pony side comic. He already does one for Pokemon.
<Pants_Dancer> See?

<herospirit> Oh. saw them for a moment
<FlutterWhat> OMG WAT
<Keyframe> The internet is
<FlutterWhat> I THEINK I MISSED IT
*MirthTinker 13's wings dangle uselessly
<Keyframe> For porn
<Silvermane> 15Hmm, perhaps I was too heavy for your new wings.
<Denied_Existence> 3Yourself?
<herospirit> :[
<Pants_Dancer> PG.
<Pants_Dancer> The internet is for HORNS.
<Vakie> i don't thinkso dash
<Silvermane> 15DecapKing, Polarfire looks bored
<CogWeaver> the internet is for corn
<Ali1017> Yes, PG please *late*
*CogWeaver noms on corn*
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0And then sads
<Vakie> might have beem...
<DecapKing> 4come on, i feel kind of useless here
<herospirit> Where's Best Blue Guy?
<Vakie> BOOO! sad music.
<Denied_Existence> 3....
<Keyframe> Cogweaver please don't mention corn.
<MourningStar> 12he should be bored
<Denied_Existence> 3 0_o
<herospirit> Off kicking ass?
*Silvermane 15lifts one of her wings, rubbing it gently
<Pants_Dancer> So grab a chick (a la, Rainbow Dash Iron Pony) and double-click.
<Sumica> sounds like porno music.
<Dashite> Best blue guy is dead.
*Polarfire is intrigued
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0He's hurt, herospirit
<Keyframe> Where I'm staying there are two.... Corn fields
*Mongoose rubs his many ribs
*DecapKing 4bucks Polarfire in the jaw using his hind legs
<MirthTinker> 13oooo...that shouldn't feel as good as it does
<DecapKing> 4thanks
<Pants_Dancer> See Ali, I could be a mod.
<Dashite> He got's shot.
*Keyframe rubs his manly stubble.
<HotCocoa> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, HotCocoa!
<herospirit> Best Blue Guy = invincible
*Polarfire is KO'd
<Denied_Existence> 3......
<Vakie> there he is!
<FlutterWhat> ohhhyeaahhhhhhhh
<CogWeaver> but...CORN! there's nothing better than it! ....except for pie...and of course pancakes...
<Silvermane> 15If you ever find bloodflow is lost, rubbing a wing brings it back quickly
<Dashite> Doesn't look invincible to me...
<KnightLight> Hiya, everypony!
<CogWeaver> there's NOTHING like pancakes
<Pants_Dancer> Eggs
<CogWeaver> KnightLight!
<Denied_Existence> 3Not the romantic fun I expected....
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Wah wah wah
<herospirit> Best Blue Guy = better than the rest of the cast combined
*CogWeaver bro-hoofs his brother*
<Keyframe> Corn is good, it makes whiskey. But... I don't want to live next to it.
<Mongoose> Tortilla Chips
*HotCocoa feels like a nut.
<MirthTinker> 13keep doing that
<Pants_Dancer> Pancakes are NOTHING LIKE EGGS.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Dat guitar
<DecapKing> 4i kind of expected this
<Keyframe> Messes up my internets
<Pants_Dancer> OMFG
<Mongoose> I say Tortilla as
<Denied_Existence> 3You should have kissed him instead DecapKing
<Pants_Dancer> :3
<Mongoose> TOR TILLA
*Lyra is now a nut.
<Pants_Dancer> /nick Nut_Butter
<Keyframe> BWAAAAAAAAAAAAA I need to sleep
<DecapKing> 4fuck off DE
*Pants_Dancer sighs
<Silvermane> 15MirthTinker, maybe when I'm done. Got a bit more teaching to do first...
<Mongoose> Not tor tea
<Vakie> o.O how he get shot? the bullet was in the brief case...
<Keyframe> Confound these Bronies!
<Mongoose> tor tea a
*Lyra is bored waiting for 140GB to transfer between disks.
<MirthTinker> 13wait, there's /more/?
<herospirit> Drummer ruins the moment with his face
<Dashite> He got shot in the car chase.
<Silvermane> 15Naturally
<Denied_Existence> 3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/6.png
<Sumica> diflected by case.
<Sumica> would have been a had shot.
<Vakie> I know that, but the affro guy used a case to deflect the bullet o.O
<Sumica> head*
<Pants_Dancer> tOrtAuh.
*Polarfire wakes up and spits out a tooth
<Vakie> from what it looked like anyways.
*Silvermane 15places a hoof back in the crook between her wings, then traces it along the feather-support bone to her wing tip
<Polarfire> Alright.
<herospirit> Trippy as all fuck
<Dashite> He did. Just not enough.
<Vakie> Ah.
<Polarfire> What the hell bro?
<Silvermane> 15That should feel akin to electricity in a good way
<Pants_Dancer> My own Phoenetic spelling for words uses Capital vowels and lowercase for soft-vowels.
<Vakie> what is this!? we all triping on somehting o.o
<Pants_Dancer> Only works in english, & stuff.
<Dashite> Yes
<DecapKing> 4blame silver, he suggested it
<VioletVanilla> 6Dashite! ^.^
<Denied_Existence> 3DecapKing, now kiss and make up.
*Pants_Dancer coughs
<Dashite> Hey VioletVanilla
<herospirit> Doesn't Best Blue Guy realize his love interest isn't nearly cool enough to be his love interest?
<Pants_Dancer> I apparently have a cough.
<Silvermane> 15I just said he looked bored. Could have played a board game with him
*Denied_Existence 3pushes DecapKing towards Polarfire.
<Mongoose> "Hand me them TOR TILLA chips"
<Vakie> Zelda crystal thing o.O
<Pants_Dancer> Darn it.
*DecapKing 4hits Denied_Existence in the ribs again
<herospirit> Hahaha what
<Sumica> looks like they drove to europe from newyork.
<VioletVanilla> 6Hihiiiii~~~~
<Pants_Dancer> *dem
<VioletVanilla> 6How are you?
<MirthTinker> 13hehe...bored board ga-OH!
*Denied_Existence 3shrugs off the blow this time.
*Polarfire spits another tooth in Decapking's face
<Dashite> Kinda hungry actually. :)
<MirthTinker> 13that tickles
<herospirit> Did BBG die?
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Macleans Magazine's Report on Pony (http://tinyurl.com/3hprskj)
*KnightLight is still trying to figure out how to use this chat more fully...
<Pants_Dancer> *"Hoof me dem TOR TILLA chips"
*Denied_Existence 3pokes DecapKing.
<DecapKing> 4next time im going to stab you DE
<Vakie> yup
<Natleyn> Assume yes.
<Natleyn> Sadness.
<KnightLight> ah, got it!
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Eeyup ;_;
<Sumica> yeah
*Denied_Existence 3pokes DecapKing again.
<Pants_Dancer> Who is "Macleans"?
<herospirit> His world just wasn't AWESOME enough to support his BODACITY
<Thunder_Dash> > Maclean's reported on Pony
*Natleyn hugs VioletVanill and Dashite
*DecapKing 4stabs Denied_Existence in the hoof using his combat knife
*KnightLight bro-hoofs his brother back*
<herospirit> His spirit has gone to become a Pony
<Natleyn> Grr, keyboard.
<CogWeaver> :D
*VioletVanilla hugs Natleyn back gently~ (:
<DecapKing> 4told you
<herospirit> We will miss you Best Blue Guy
<KnightLight> sorry to leave ya hangin' like that
<Denied_Existence> 3FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Sumica> da magics
*Polarfire pulls out a pistol and shoots Decapking in the gut
<Silvermane> 15Heh, yes. Fortunately for you I'm going gentle. The wingtip is extremely sensitive to stimulation, and personally i get a little brain dead if the support bone is rubbed to firmly. It's because it is all wired directly to the spinal column.
<VioletVanilla> 6OH Dashie, I would so make you some food. . . ;A;
<Vakie> his corpse is in the back of the car...lol they would be screwed if a cop pulled them over...
<CogWeaver> no problem
<Denied_Existence> 3......
<Polarfire> Wat now beeeyetch.
<Denied_Existence> 3It appears you have been shot.
<HaysforPonies> So why are grown-ups fascinated with the southern accent of the cowboy-hat-wearing pony Applejack, or lines like, âAre you sure about this, Scootaloo?â
*DecapKing 4starts bleeding
<Silvermane> 15to teh moon
<Mongoose> I enjoy TOR TILLA chips
<HaysforPonies> I loled at their line choice.
<DecapKing> 4well aint that a bitch
<FlutterWhat> he's blue
<Thunder_Dash> RIP Best Blue Guy
<FlutterWhat> so
<Dashite> I'll just have to make something up myself.
<MirthTinker> 13but isn't the tip just feathers?
<FlutterWhat> they would have worse to deal with then the police
<Denied_Existence> 3Good thing I am a medic...oh wait...you stabbed me in my operating foot....
<CrimsonFoxx> People like southern accents, that's one of the reasons Bunny Rabbot is so popular in the Sonic fandom.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0mfw this movie is the only thing keeping me awake. ' ^ '
<Dashite> lol
<Denied_Existence> 3hoof...
<herospirit> Oh my gosh guys. Best Blue Guy DID become a Pony!
<Denied_Existence> 3(FUUUUUUU)
<Vakie> O.O
<CogWeaver> also AJ is the best pony
<Vakie> resserection via flowers!
<DecapKing> 4its barley even a flesh wound

<FlutterWhat> wat
<Dashite> Exorcism via flowers.
<Ali1017> Twilight
<Silvermane> 15It's actually a nerve ending with very pliable bones underneath. The feathers there are sensitive to wind currents, and help us fly quite a bit.
<Vakie> HA! nice hero
<CogWeaver> hush you, Ali
<herospirit> Best Blue Guy = Blues
*Mongoose has a thing for country boys
<Thunder_Dash> herospirit; Suddenly... it all becomes clear
<Ali1017> :P
<Lyra> I AM NOT STALKING TWILIoh you weren't talking about me.
<Polarfire> Here. Take these with you.
*Polarfire tosses his 2 lost teeth at Decapking
<CogWeaver> lol
<herospirit> He even has a musical cutie mark!
<Balloons> Yeah, out of the main six. It's Twilight :)
<CogWeaver> bah

<KnightLight> fill me in: what does "+v" mean? Sorry everyone, noob here
<CogWeaver> you just say that because she's the main character

<Sumica> Oki gonna go get me some panda express, will be back in a few.
<CrimsonFoxx> Strangely enough, I actually got into the fandom because I was curious of a friendship is magic tag on a picture of BonBon I found.
<CogWeaver> it means you can talk like us mods when the room gets +m'd
<KnightLight> o i c
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0I want some~
<Mongoose> It means you can speak while the ro~ nevermind
<herospirit> How much longer is this movie?
<KnightLight> lol
<CogWeaver> like so:
<herospirit> I don't have much time before I have to sleep. :0
*Silvermane 15lightly lifts a large feather from her wing, careful not to bend it too far. "That's okay, we can try that later. This feather her is a pinion feather. They are heavily connected to the wing, so pressure on them is very noticable."
<CogWeaver> now everyone who isn't a mod or isn't voiced can't speak
<CogWeaver> :P
<Sumica> 15-20min
<Vakie> creepy snowy mountain place
<LunaOnTheMoon> oh my
<Thunder_Dash> Is this music from Castlevania or something? It sure sounds like it, IMO
<Dashite> Plenty of time to go get some food.
<Lyra> I can speak
<CrimsonFoxx> Of course, I probably can't tell you how she was portrayed in the picture since the chat is rated PG
<Lyra> Oh
<Lyra> Never mind.
<GumballCrash> what good is a keyboard, if you are unable to speak...?
<KnightLight> Ooo, that's devious ;)
<DecapKing> 4dont worry, it would take a while for me to bleed out from this
<Sumica> Will pick back up when I get back.
*Silvermane 15moves his hoof to a large patch of smaller, softer feathers. "These are down feathers. Very soft, good for a spot of warmth, and a good massage point if you want to make somepony relax.
<Mongoose> I love it when this room is in m+!
<LunaOnTheMoon> Lyra and BonBon = best shipping. DJPon3 and Octavia = second best.
<Natleyn> So much for editing cursors tonight.
<MirthTinker> 13I'm not sure what you mean by all that, but it feels floppy
<Natleyn> xD
<herospirit> I think Blues is now my favorite background Pony
<Lysiria> What about Lyra and Octavia? x:
<KnightLight> but really useful, I imagine, if a mod has an announcement to make or something
<Natleyn> Spent all my time watching this.
<Vakie> its amnesia all over again!
<Denied_Existence> 3Also they are good for...nevermind...
<DecapKing> 4bow chicka wow wow
<MirthTinker> 13I thought you can't feel feathers?
<Mongoose> or when the chatroom is full of spam
<Lyra> She's my ROOMMATE.
<CogWeaver> yeah, or if the room starts going idiotic or starts moving too fast
<Lyra> Geeze.
<Balloons> It's more for traffic control.
<Thunder_Dash> I hope Blues appears more in S2, even before knowing he was BBG he was cool
<HaysforPonies> Octavia and Scratch are amusing cause they are quite different yet somehow put together.
<MirthTinker> 13or is it that you feel the feather's moving in place?
<Mongoose> which drives me away from Daily
<DecapKing> 4can you feel your mane?
<BonBon> I'm pretty sure Lyra and I have never been stuffed into a crate before
*Lyra does her slouchsit next to BonBon.
<CrimsonFoxx> Myself, I kind of like Derpy and Dr. Whooves
<Silvermane> 15The feathers themselves, no. But where they connect to the wing is full of nerves
<KnightLight> we all have a bit of Derpy inside of us all, though, don't we?
<herospirit> I know right, thunder?
<FlutterWhat> bbg = big blue guy?
<Lyra> But even if we were..."shipped"...I think we all know who wears the pants in this barn.
<Silvermane> 15We don't regrow feathers, so bloodflow and nerves are very well connected to them.
<herospirit> Best Blue Guyy
*BonBon is sitting next to Lyra. though for some reason she feels as if she should have white hair
<Natleyn> Best blue guy
<CogWeaver> 6_9 derp
<Natleyn> I want a library like that. :(
<Vakie> O.O AMNESIA! RUN FROM THE ZOMBLES!
<Silvermane> 15Also, never EVER pull on a feather by itself. It would be at best, very painful, and at worst, traumatizing.
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Beware the druids
<CogWeaver> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 9d:09h:05m:00s
<CogWeaver> come OOOOOOOOON!!
<VioletVanilla> 6Amnesia is a wonderful game. . .
<Dee> Lyra, your perfect the way you are <3
<herospirit> Who is now a reference only we 10 current active users will understand :P
<KnightLight> YAY!!!
<CrimsonFoxx> I once found a picture where Lyra and BonBon were re-enacting the infamous chocolate pudding scene from Rugrats.
<BonBon> What exactly does that mean Lyra?
<DecapKing> 4kind of like losing a hoof?
<Thunder_Dash> Hah, yeah xD
<Denied_Existence> 3Sortakinda
<MirthTinker> 13wait, we don't regrow them? but I thought birds can regrow feathers and molt them all the time!
*Natleyn highfives the active people in #bronystate
<Silvermane> 15heh, I suppose, although you don't typically lose baby hoofs
<FlutterWhat> HE MADE BETTHOVEN?!
<Vakie> o.O he killed bethoven!?
*Razyn_the_Pony 0brohoofs Natelyn
<Silvermane> 15Birds are ALL feather. Pegasi are mostly fur
<FlutterWhat> WAS THAT FERENGIE
<FlutterWhat> WHAT IS THIS
*DecapKing 4shudders at the thought
<Thunder_Dash> So wait... that old man has been kidnapping alien musicians just because he wants awards?
<herospirit> From now on Blues is BBG, which will be confusing to other Bronystate users. :p
<CogWeaver> Lyra, no matter how much you want to be a human, ponies don't where pants
<FlutterWhat> FERENGIES ARN"T GOOD AT MUSICS
*herospirit brohoofs all
<CogWeaver> *wear
<DecapKing> 4that sounds terrible
<Silvermane> 15Not to mention we use a spot of our own magic in flight.
<LunaOnTheMoon> !link Lyra_and_BonBon
<CogWeaver> whoa, odd typo
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<GumballCrash> at least not often
*Thunder_Dash brohoofs back
<BonBon> That doesn't stop her CogWeaver, trust me
<herospirit> lol wat?
<CogWeaver> lol
<herospirit> Awards = control of the world?
<Lyra> CogWeaver: You, sir, do not understand what it is to wear pants.
<Silvermane> 15So let's see...
<FlutterWhat> omg lol
<Vakie> lol
<Natleyn> Meteor killed his family, so he became immortal and used music to take control of the world?
<Dee> i don't wear pants... only when its a wed and my pants are in the wash... and so are my undergarments... its so cold ;3;
<Razyn_the_Pony> 0Hells yeah
<herospirit> hahaha what the hell is going on
<Natleyn> One hell of a childhood
<JackiePie> Ponies are jelly that pants look best on Lyra
<CogWeaver> so when Lyra gets poison-joke'd, does she turn into a human?
<FlutterWhat> NO
<FlutterWhat> STOP THAT
<FlutterWhat> STOP THAT DOCTOR
<Thunder_Dash> Makes perfect sense to me... Apart from the part where it doesn't, which is like... All of it
<Silvermane> 15Oh, the underwing is pretty ticklish. *Runs a hoof under her wing near the bottom*
<FlutterWhat> WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG
<LunaOnTheMoon> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Lyra> It's not about being human.
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around LunaOnTheMoon in a tight embrace
<herospirit> He's making the perfect musician
<Lyra> I don't want to be a human.
<MirthTinker> 13hehehEHEHEHE NO that's not fair, I'm tied to the wall!
<CogWeaver> uh-huh

<Lyra> And don't ask me where the hand thing came from.
<FlutterWhat> YES
<KnightLight> yay, thanks, Derpy!
<VioletVanilla> 6 NEIN NEIN NEIN!
<Lyra> That wasn't me.
<FlutterWhat> REBECCA BLACK
<Vakie> Boom! headshot!
