<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13and I did terrible against Sakuya LOL
<Aurora> 6I can handle most of sakuya's cards pretty well by now

<Dermathil> MOTHERFING GAME
<Dman> D:
<Aurora> 6until you get used to fighting her
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13Then again, at least two of her spells caught me off guard

<Pegacorn> I wonder where RainBroDash went.
<RobotPinkie> Also planning to go full cupcakes on Dash
<Dashite> Gilda wouldn't go cupcakes on Dash.
<Dashite> Gilda <3 Dash
<RobotPinkie> Gilda x Dash is a popular ship?
<Ziltoid> I hope shes comes back in season 2
<Pegacorn> GildaxDash:A ship that i'm ok with.That and HunterxWitch,but that's another story.
<Ziltoid> lolwut
<FreezeFrame> I'm not opposed to Gilda/Dash, but I think that works better with it being one-way
<silvermane> 'You arrogant little ruffians just think you're the best when it comes to killin' monsters, don't you? When i was a lad, we used to eat monsters FOR BREAKFAST!! With a side of hash browns! And some juice. You super-deformed pipsqueaks should leave the monster-stompin' to the big boys and GO HOME!'
<Pegacorn> HunterxWitch:A non-existent ship between two special Infected from L4D.

<Dman> Tadaima
<Cloudey> 06need to test this bad boy of a mouse out on a game, BBL
<FreezeFrame> I wish 1) I was better at making AMV/PMVs and 2) we had a few more normal Luna scenes to work with
<FreezeFrame> Because my iTunes just went to Papercut, and it seems like it'd be great for Luna/NMM
<Silverscreen> 11Don't worry. Season 2 brings more Luna.
<Dman> freezeframe - you wanna make a luna papercut song?
<Pegacorn> Strategic use?I don't think so!
<RobotPinkie> okaeri, Dman-kun
*Pegacorn shoots RobotPinkie
<FreezeFrame> Dman: The lyrics just seem to fit
<Dman> yada yada

*RobotPinkie is made of bullet proof alloys
<FreezeFrame> Occasional flashes of the Mane 6's breakdowns, too, but yeah.
<Pegacorn> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Dman> freezeframe you just missed a very good video
<Espeon|Games> I use like a rather normal mouse, the only problem I have is that I don't have enough space for it lol
<Dman> with excellent editing
<Dman> : /
<Espeon|Games> 6that was in purple, what you saw was an illusion
<Cloudey> 06i was shopping for new gear today, since i needed a present for my dad his birthday

<Dman> cupcake is probably your latest victim >_<
<RobotPinkie> I don't have victims!
<RobotPinkie> What kind of person do you think I am? :O
<FreezeFrame> Hmmm... Now, actually, I need to figure out which version of papercut would be better for that PMV
<RobotPinkie> I do make cupcakes though. Really really good ones.
<FreezeFrame> Papercut or Ppr:Kut
<silvermane> i make good brownies and yelow cake
<Pegacorn> afk
<RobotPinkie> I love brownies
<RobotPinkie> I would love to ship with brownies
<FreezeFrame> Nah, as much as I like the background music of Ppr:Kut, Papercut is much better overall.
*FreezeFrame has Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and Meteora, naturally.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ok so I'll admit
<Dman> freezeframe - semirelated but there's a newgrounds animation that's really good.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I honestly think this Pokemon is so ugly it's cute

<Dman> All here in silverscreen's youtube synch
<Dman> aka synchtube
<Dubtrotmaster> okay im going there
<Dubtrotmaster> Synchtube does not work well in Internet Explorer! Please use Google Chrome or Firefox
<Dubtrotmaster> i dont use either of those
<Dman> You're not using chrome or firefox? :o
<Dman> whoa dude

<Dman> Dashite you're here thou
<Dman> there *
<Dashite> In Firefox. Just loaded up IE9 to test.
<Dman> ah ok
<HyperMetalLugia> Wet~
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<HyperMetalLugia> Not anymore :D
<nickstr> I did a big no no today with a circuit in order to measure how much current was being drawn
<nickstr> shorting across a switch with an ammeter
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL, so nickstr, I was setting music up for my sister's party and the radio signal sucked
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd step away for like 10 seconds and it was static
<nickstr> FAIL
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony sucks
<nickstr> that is why you DON'T use the radio for providing music for an event
<drfsupercenter> 03their boomboxes are terrible garbage now
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not
<drfsupercenter> 03I just needed something to put on while my sister was making a playlist for her mp3 player XD
<Cloudey> 06i don't like sony too
<Cloudey> 06for sound systems, i prefer Bose :P
<drfsupercenter> 03right now I just have it playing music from her (EW) iPod through my Logitech computer speakers
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just using the Sony boombox to amplify it nice and loud
<nickstr> I would still hunt down a CFS-6000 boombox though
<Cloudey> 06i woulkd like the BFG-9000 boombox :D
<nickstr> nope
<Cloudey> 06ahw....
<nickstr> the CFS-6000 was a boombox made by Sony in the mid 1980s
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony was good in the 80s
<drfsupercenter> 03*90s
<drfsupercenter> 03we had a really awesome Trinitron flat-screen CRT TV
<nickstr> it has autoreverse cassette along with an AM stereo/FM stereo tuner
<nickstr> the AM side is multisystem
<Cloudey> 06the BFG-9000 was a boombox made by ID in the FIRST stage of FPS game action
<nickstr> Harris/Kahn/Motorola/Magnavox
<nickstr> that or one by Sanyo would be a killer find
<nickstr> the MW-250
<nickstr> same as the Sony one
<nickstr> in terms of capabilities
<Cloudey> 06BFG-900 as in BOOMBOX is a Big F*cking Gun
<Cloudey> 06:d
*Cloudey flees
<Cloudey> 06*BFG-9000
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 The BFG (Book)
<nickstr> some of the 1980s boomboxes also get shortwave broadcasts
<nickstr> but I am not too interested in those
<nickstr> I already have one of the best modern communications receivers for shortwave
<drfsupercenter> 03ut of course you do
<drfsupercenter> 03*but

<Dragoran> The actual ambernova server runs off a debian server :p
*Nick muzzles Arcanine
<Nick> EYAAAAhahahaaa
<Soital> 12I remember getting Flareon and Vaporeon ex in 2 packets I bought in woolworths many many years ago
*Arcanine yelps at the muzzle
<Soital> 12I know thats rare but my favourite out of the three is Jolteon LOL
<NightSeas> 12Problem is, it probably would end up costing about $150+ to hunt them all down XD
<Soital> 12o-o
<Arcanine> 12lol
<NightSeas> 12Unless I just started looking for the packs instead |D
<NightSeas> 12Might end up spending less if I did that lol
*Arcanine scratches at muzzle
<Soital> 12+ more cards
<NightSeas> 12Yep :3
<Arcanine> 12i got flareon and vaporeon ex at nationals for like 6 each
<Arcanine> 12jolteon and vaporeon star though were like 25 each
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<Pegacorn> RainBroDash.Wazzup.
*SilverSonic removes Arcanine's muzzle and runs

<Arcanine> 12espeon star was up at a vendor for 100
<Arcanine> 12and umbreon star was up for 80
<NightSeas> 12lol
*Arcanine chews on Nick for revenge
<Soital> 12I think I've only bought one card online and it was a certain Mew card I wanted and after loads of packets of failure (i got nearly all the rares apart from the one I wanted LOL) I bought it online :3
<NightSeas> 12That's pretty awesome
<Soital> 12Every other card I have is either from packets or trades :3
<Soital> 12My friends used to be little thieves though when we were kids >_>
<Pegacorn> Anypony still here?
*Nick was wearing kevlar hence why Arcanine has broken teeth right now
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, all my cards are from packs :3
<Soital> 12So when I found out they stole my card I took it right back, as well as another one of theirs as a sign to "never steal from me again" xD
*Arcanine has shaper teeth
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Soital> 12I remember the day before I was finally able to trade the old Charizard card with someone (everyone wanted that around our area and this kid had 2 and would trade me for a Kabutops) the Kabutops card suddenly went missing >o
<Dman> i are
<Dman> no one else rly
<Dman> lol
<Soital> 12And my friend got a Kabutops in "a packet he bought".
<NightSeas> 12I remember my brother used to sneak and trade with my cards XD
<Soital> 12Heck, I was not stupid as a kid so, the bottom line is I got my charizard in the end ;3
<Soital> 12LOL!
<Pegacorn> Ohai Dman
<Lunies> Only Pokemon card I have left is a holographic Typhlosion that my best friend gave me before he moved
<Dermathil> hello again
<SilverMane> hello
<Lunies> We gave eachother our bests cards to remember eachother
<Guest42780> lol fail
<Soital> 12That's really sweet <3
<Guest42780> talking about me
<Guest42780> not you
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony
<Soital> 12What did you give your friend?
<Lunies> Aha Ascendant
<Lunies> I believe I gave him a Lugia
<Arcanine> 12hmm
<Dman> rainbrodash outta nowhere
<Lunies> That being said, our best might not be someone else's best. We didn't play properly
<Lunies> And we had emotional attachments to one card over another just because of the pokemon, not how effective the card was
<Soital> 12<3 That sounds like me as well
<NightSeas> 12I used to REALLY want a Charizard card, so I traded my brother a Shining Gyarados card XD
<Soital> 12I never got a shining card D:
<NightSeas> 12Funny thing is, the Shining Gyarados was in reality a better card XD
<NightSeas> 12But back then I only carded about the Pokemon the card was lol
<NightSeas> 12cared*
<Soital> 12I remember that everyone wanted my Moltres from the fossil collection owo
<RainBroDash> 10:3
<Soital> 12Every around my area seemed to have Articuno and Zapdos from that collection, but never Moltres XD
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, Moltres was really rare lol
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<NightSeas> 12I only have one Moltres to this day
<Soital> 12I was too attached to let it go ^^
<Soital> 12A lot of the cards I have, have some history to it
<NightSeas> 12Surprisingly though, Articuno was not very rare compared to other legendary’s
<Lunies> Yeah, I noticed that NightSeas
<Lunies> Almost every collection has an Articuno
<Soital> 12e.g Dark Magneton was the only card that wasn't lost when I took my cards out to the city and I lost nearly every single shiny card bar Dark Magneton, so I had to collect all over ;w;
<Dman> ...keksy
<Soital> 12and I still have it <3
<Lunies> With its popularity, you'd think it would be the other wat around
<Nick> Tommy_Wiseua
<NightSeas> 12Dark Magneton :3

<Nuclear> Pegasi
<Dashite> lol
<zeptometer> its a YTP
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<zeptometer> its prolly the funniest one
<Blums> exactly, so not all wingboners are caused by arousal
<Dashite> It would be nice to know if it was a man or a woman first.
<SilverMane> all of them in an orgy
<Quanyails> 7Is the meeting 5 or 6 o'clock EDT?
<SilverMane> ALL THE PONIES
<Ascendant> NightSeas I know, but being serious doesn't usually warrant a "trying too hard sign"
<NewDCD> 9what is everyone talking about, anyways?
<Ascendant> uh
<Dashite> Celestia Radio
<SilverMane> i would go for pony
<Dman> newdcd celestia radio

<Ascendant> @ Roara
<NewDCD> 9well
<SilverMane> OH GOD RERAPENING
<Ascendant> Also I need to move the TF2 server
<Roara|TF2> 6how about
<^RainbowDash> But similar reactions result from arousal in several other manners as well.
*Ascendant has been lazy
<SilverMane> NOT THE RERAPENING
<Quanyails> 7Okay, before.

<Ascendant> Well

<Dman> convince me to staaaayyyyy
<SilverMane> how do we get our shit read?
<Blums> With a name like that... its a good thing applejack isnt here
<^RainbowDash> Hopefully speaking in purely scientific terms is still PG. Assuming I avoid anatomy lessons xP
<Ascendant> Yeah XD

<Ascendant> Can you make it at 12 or something, Roara?
<Dman> DOO EET
<Dermathil> BTW NewDCD, I got Tekkaman Blade last time I played SRW-J
<^RainbowDash> Gall bladders and femurs are hardly PG.
<Dashite> SOON
<Ascendant> Because that'd be 2 hours back
<^RainbowDash> xL
<Sneas> 03funny as hell
<Blums> how is a gall bladder not pg?
<Dashite> "I AM YOUR TOY"
<Diaphone> ^
<Blums> doesnt that just release emzymes to help digest stuff?
<Nuclear> \w/ -_- \w/
<Ascendant> Arti can probably make that and most people should as well
<Quanyails> 7Rescheduling the meeting a day before it occurs isn't the best option, though.
<NewDCD> 9eh, it's full
<Unidentified42854> Femurs aren't PG? I'd say lack of femurs isn't PG...
<Crainy> oh my.....
<Dman> "MUSHROOM!!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 9maybe I should just listen to the recording
<Quanyails> 7 3:00 EDT works for me.
<Dman> MUSHROOM BEGINS
<Diaphone> yeah basically, you can live without your gall bladder
<Unidentified42854> Imagine how grimdark MLP would eb without femurs...
<Dman> R RATAN PONY DISCUSSAN

<Dman> i had to try like 20 times
<Roara|TF2> 6I don't really want to take part
<Chimera> 04impossible
<Ascendant> It's fine

<NewDCD> 9but for me, it isn't really streaming
<Dman> but it ain't livestream
<Quanyails> 7I feel bad for shortening your name to the same pronunciation as 'chyme'.
<SilverMane> ha?
<Crainy> well
<Quanyails> 7Did I say that before?
<pinkie> if pg is overrated then go to equstria after dark

<Dragoran> Altair you need to fix the forum spoilers tag
<Crainy> or else, who knows what you guys would be talking about...
<Dragoran> and read the To do list topic
<Dermathil> That's why I say I got a livesync, not a livestream.
<Dman> black woman?
<Nuclear> Heh heh.
<Blums> We'd be talking about cupcakes
<NewDCD> 9Rasquisha?
<Crainy> thats not funny
<Quanyails> 7Ascendant knew those right words and said ":P" for 3 times. <-- And more random browsing.
<Dman> newdcd is in?
<Nuclear> I wouldn't know...
<Dman> YAY
<SilverMane> she comes from the herd
<Chimera> 04Quan are you okay owo
<zeptometer> me one
<zeptometer> lol
<Dman> eeyup
*^RainbowDash would be having relationships
<Pyroh> I wish you a waffle christmas
<Blums> Not-pg does not equal sexual stuff, its excessive blood, gore, and cruelty aswell
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Pyroh> And a happy root beer :3
<WindWhistler> so, anybody from the UK?
<Dman> who is this legend of a man?
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Pyroh> Also hi
<NewDCD> 9this is pretty lackluster so far
<Dman> WHAT FIC
<Nuclear> Why does it always have to be sexual...
<zeptometer> .....................
<^RainbowDash> Trust me, it's already like that in other chats without the PG tag xP
<zeptometer> because rule 34
<Nuclear> Hi Pyroh!
<Dman> newdcd - was amazing before
<NewDCD> 9well this might be interesting
<Crainy> yeah
<SilverMane> oh god
<Pyroh> Hey buddy!
<SilverMane> WHAT
<Crainy> what the hell
<Dman> WHAT IS EET
<Crainy> is hell a PG word?
<Pyroh> How goes it :3
<Dashite> MONOPOLY?!
<SilverMane> Celestia Radio plays monopoly?
<Blums> relationships are pg rainbow dash, but not whats done behind closed doors
<Ascendant> lolwut, Quanyails?
<Dman> The game the game the game
<Cracky> I wonder if Vector Calculus is PG...
<Pyroh> Nukin Equestria are ya?
<Cracky> probably not...
<Dermathil> I hear that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a love letter to the various Robot genres and is creating a whole new generation of Robot Animes.
<SilverMane> it was really well hidden, the game was
<^RainbowDash> Because, they usually just turn to, to put it bluntly, pornography
<Dashite> So much game. >_<
<Nuclear> Nope not right now...
<GGgala> Dman ohh, i was playing spiral knights fora while there
<Pyroh> Cool cool
<Dman> dermathil - newdcd said that a few days ago :P
<Dman> GGgala o ok

<NewDCD> 9The gay was over
<pinkie> derpybot help
<Dman> O. ... O.K.
<Dman> R.U.B.C.?
<Nuclear> With the active peoples....
*^RainbowDash does specify specific cuddly-kissy scenes though
<Quanyails> 7What don't you get?
<Dermathil> oh yeah I remember now, Dman.
<Blums> well thats true i guess
<^RainbowDash> Nothing graphic, but...
<Quanyails> 7Don't take that as some sort of imperative interrogation.
<Crainy> ...
<Blums> rainbow dash would never be cuddly-kissy
<Blums> i just dont see it in her
<Pyroh> ...
<Pyroh> Ok then :3
<Crainy> why do you have to do this??
*^RainbowDash licks Blums
<Arcanine> 12hi slashy
<Blums> ...
<Pyroh> Rainbow
<Dermathil> I wonder if one of the reasons why people were so psyched about Gurren Lagann was because of the Pacing of the episodes.
<Crainy> what does that ^ mean???
<Pyroh> Why do you lick everyone!
<NewDCD> 9dat imitation
<Blums> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO RAINBOW DASH
<Dman> dat imitation
<Dashite> He's damn good at that.
*Nuclear is like damnit

<Blums> GIVE US RAINBOW BACK
<Dermathil> 'Cause it really isn't drawn out by filler episodes at all.

<Nuclear> Well
<Dashite> If he didn't have such an awesome voice...

<Crainy> and..
<Crainy> uhm
<zeptometer> hey misti
<Crainy> hows the other one called
<Blums> I dont like how much focus twilight gets in the show
<MrPoniator> I like all of 'em, but I'd put Rarity last if I had to make a list. That's the only notable thing
<Crainy> Rarity
<pinkie> Blums i cant belive im 5
<Crainy> is also cool
<Blums> is there even one episode where twilight isnt in it?
<Dman> LUNA WONT YOU CRY FOR ME!!!!
<Dman> Yes!

<Dman> he's epic
<Dermathil> mind telling me when this is live?
<Dman> ok dermathil ...
<Blums> Pinkie by "or" i meant i cant decide between you rarity or twilight

<MrPoniator> Twi
<zeptometer> oh
<zeptometer> duh
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<zeptometer> she has the most screen time
<^RainbowDash> Well, I guess she's the "mane character" after all, even if some episodes don't revolve arpund her
<Crainy> the question is

<Dman> GGgala http://ponify.me/chat/
<Dman> here
<Peabnuts123> I had never noticed them actually call her rose/roseluck in the show
<SilverMane> Dman, it's not comments wher i ask him
<TGPFluttershy> Querying is PMing
<Dman> Silvermane - :O
<^Stargazer> derpy hooves might not be fanname
<Nuclear> God damnit cover blown again
<Blums> derpy hooves started as a fanname
<MelonJuice> Well, Roseluck is the actual name tho
<MrPoniator> Well, Derpy Hooves started as a fanname
<^Stargazer> won't know till season 2 is released and they actually call her by name though
<HyperMetalLugia> So does that mean DRF is a bulimic now?
<SilverMane> right, TGPFluttershy is right
<MelonJuice> yeah
<Blums> she was originally ditzy doo or something
<Skylands> 10http://www.pokewiki.de/images/f/fe/Ho-oh2.png

<MrPoniator> Didn't Ditzy Doo come after it?
<drf-Droid> no
<MelonJuice> but Faust said they would probably call her Ditzy Doo
<Crainy> Shes an evil enchantress!
<SilverMane> trololol isgold
<drf-Droid> that's why I said cough
<^Stargazer> I dunno why, I like Ditzy... maybe because everyone makes her out to be a retard when I think she's just clumbsey
<Dashite> NewDCD, you need to let that guy die.
<Balloons> Everyone?
<Blums> ditzy is an affable sweetheart in all her fan renditions
<Xiagu|Inkscape> Guys there's no way they're going to actually address Derpy by name in S2, she's just going to be Where's Waldo-ing in the background
<MrPoniator> And then there are stuff like DJ Pon3
<NewDCD> 9Dashite: Shinn is cool. The rest of SEED is mostly shit.
<Dashite> Shinn is a whiny asshole. He sucks.
<Dashite> So much.
<Dman> %
<^Stargazer> I laugh... don't they know what internet 1337 speak is
<Dashite> He needs to get punched in the face more often.
<Dman> percentage of newdcds rage?
<^Stargazer> Pon Three... /laugh
<Crainy> When is S2 going to air, anyways?
<MelonJuice> Xiagu don't say that!
<NewDCD> 9>complaining about Shinn
<NewDCD> 9>not about Jesus or Assram
<MrPoniator> Well, Vinyl Scratch works for her too, I suppose
<Blums> "Our bronies, hang out too. (come on bronies) Cuz they know we're awesome fillies! (come on every pony)"
<Dman> Hey Dermathil look what's on
<MelonJuice> dont crush my dreams

<Dman> (gurren lagann :P)
<Dermathil> and I know
<NewDCD> 9also Dashite

<pinkie> http://youtu.be/U3qS0odekuU fished product of this http://youtu.be/5Hm3MF0U9v0
<MelonJuice> I think it's actually DJ Pon-3
<MrPoniator> Dj Pon3 needs more screentime
<Dashite> Damn you monster guy! Why couldn't you hit Shinn instead?!
<NewDCD> 9Shinn is awesome in SRWZ's plot
<Blums> yeah in equestria girls they said "DJ pon-3"
<SilverMane> lol this is epic
<MrPoniator> Well, that's how you say it anyway
<Dashite> >Shinn >awesome
<NewDCD> 9because Z basically fixed SRW
<Dermathil> >mfw I missed Gurren Lagann's attack and I only noticed the enemy's attack
<NewDCD> 9DERP I mean SEED
<Dashite> >does not compute
<NewDCD> 9it fixed SEED and made Shinn awesome and Jesus and Assram bearable
<SilverMane> if he dances the night away to numanuma, that was my idea
<Paul_McColtney> DJ-P0N3
<NewDCD> 9Dashite: it was SO GOOD it caused Fukuda to be BUTTHURT BEYOND REPAIR

<Dermathil> YER GUNNA TASTE IT
<Flamerunner|TF2> he doesn't know i'm a brony and don't plan to tell him
<FreezeFrame> That's evil. Someone mentioned using a drinking game with prune juice

*BlacklightShining shakes his head
<NightSeas> 12Hia Aeroslas

<NightSeas> 12Aeroslash*
<Mongoose|dinner> and the anti-pony
<Jazza> ...and it was run by bronies
<Fish609> I freakin love ponies!
<Ziltoid> wut
<zeptometer> ^rainbowdash Idk, it bothers me when people are like real men watch ponies. I think its that real men aren't afraid of watching ponies
*Kosoveon now owns Aeroslash for ---- amount of time

<Mongoose|dinner> because it makes us look cool

<zeptometer> blums this
<junh1024-XD> >microsoft
<NewDCD> 9it was actually an ad
<HyperMetalLugia> Said something about the processor LOL
<^RainbowDash> Yeah, yeah. But people who are afraid of MLP because it's femininw or because of homophobia are just wrong. 9.9
<drf-Droid> wait

<SilverMane> will try
<Dman> NewDCD would you stream teh song if i linkied it?
<SilverMane> busy with something else atm
<zeptometer> Mongoose|dinner aww
<Fish609> Loving ponies doesn't make you a man or a woman or a gay. Loving ponies just means you love ponies.
<Fish609> It doesn't make you any more or less of a person.
<Mongoose|dinner> but to the rest of my family
<Mongoose|dinner> They're ok with it
<HyperMetalLugia> I was just about to download that :P
<zeptometer> cool
<zeptometer> see
<Arcanine> 12you can?
<Arcanine> 12:D
<prince-dari> I climbed Snowdon today. :)
<Fish609> It took me a while to realize that I did indeed love the show.
<zeptometer> I'm way too scared to come out to anyone other than my friends who like the show
<^RainbowDash> Well said.
<Arcanine> 12i think google's text to speech program is even more funny though
<Fish609> I realized it when Twilight first met Fluttershy.
<Fish609> When she did that squeek it was all over for me.
<Arcanine> 12since each language has like a different accent
<Fish609> I came out on facebook.
<Blums> I thought the show was pretty good from the first minute
<Fish609> About loving the show...
<zeptometer> I didn't realize it until pinkie fell over when they were confronting Nightmare Moon
<Mongoose|dinner> I don't care at all
<Mongoose|dinner> it's a damn show
<zeptometer> Mongoose
<zeptometer> good fucking call
<Jazza> Mongoose go to dinner
<Mongoose|dinner> it's not a big life changing thing
<zeptometer> I'm bout to go post on fb
<NewDCD> 9bathroom break
<Fish609> Its just a show. I am glad that I found something I really love. I dont really care what everyone else things about it.
<Mongoose|dinner> if anypony hates you for it
<Mongoose|dinner> they are shallow as fuck
<Fish609> If anypony hates you for it then they are not a pony. They are a mcmeanie mean pants.
<Jazza> The quicker you finish dinner the quicker you can return to your job
<zeptometer> ... I feel like such an idiot for not just thinking of it like that
<Mistipulate> The worst kind of mean mcmeanie mean pants there is!

<zeptometer|Dessert> hey, does anyone watch the show Community?
<SilverMane> OOOOOH
<SilverMane> Wyvern, very different then WyBurn
<NewDCD> 9and then he was sent with the Element of Magic in his power
<NewDCD> 9end result, SPIKE BECOMES A KAMEN RIDER
<NewDCD> 9well
<SilverMane> Spike in human world and then comedy ensued
*Dermathil gives D_man his star-shaped glasses while he puts on his V-shaped glasses.
<NewDCD> 9it's kind of like Heisei Riders, which corrupt words like that
<Mongoose> THAT WAS FILLING
<Mongoose> and good
<NewDCD> 9because it's a (Green) Fire Based Magic Type Rider
<zeptometer|Dessert> second bowl of Frosted Flakes = delicious

<Dermathil> Can't load it
<D_man> whaaa
<Paul_McColtney> ^except ponies
*SilverMane I was exhausted from another day of work. It seems like everypony wants pizza these days. Thank Celestia i'm done for today, I don't think i could stand another order. Every pizza has such weird customization, and the customers seem even weirder.
<GGgala> giant pic is giant
*SilverMane I mean seriously, why are half of the pizzas ordered with a hole in the middle?
<GGgala> >3 MB
<NewDCD> 9"A MAN'S ANGER....."
*SilverMane I glanced through the tangled mess of grey hair covering my face, towards my front door. I smiled, knowing I'd finally get a chance to rest. I had a box on my back, dinner for me and... her. It was safely strapped to my vest, which, ehem, /proudly/ declared me Pizza Pony of Little Celestia's Pizzeria
<NewDCD> 9"SA-SA-SAKURETSU CUT!"

<Dermathil> ^^
<Blums> "Princess celestia is the ONLY pony with BOTH pegusai wings and a unicorn's horn"
*SilverMane Honestly, I hate this job. I'm only doing it for the bits, so that I can put myself through college, as a master's degree in Psychology isn't cheap .Seems like every day someone tries to pay me... in an alternative manner.
<^RainbowDash> Luna. 9.9
<NewDCD> 9DERP
<Ziltoid> lol
*SilverMane Why, I remember this one time, I was delivering a Pizza Cake to some guy named Goatees, man his parents must hate him, and this weirdo was outside his house with a camera. Apparently, he was expecting something film worthy.
<NewDCD> 9also guys here, some of Wyburn's prototype designs are to the right of the image http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/114/7/0/huge_poni_related_sketchdump_by_time_diver-d3es186.png

<D_man> dermathil hmm working for me from here
<Blums> Well cabbage luna was introduced from the very start of the episode so they could have left that only part out?
*SilverMane I still shudder whenever I picture the leather bit in his mouth. Gah, so creepy. Although, sometimes /she/ likes some interesting things... Realizing that I had been standing outside for 4 minutes, I rushed towards my door, carefully shouldering it open.
*SilverMane With a light flutter, I set the box down on the floor, and shrug off my vest, hanging it up on the wall. Next to it goes my hat, stained with peanut butter and cake batter.
<prince-dari> Looks cool DCD.

<^RainbowDash> DOOOO ITTT
<MrPoniator> Why don't you make a tree, and get out of here
<SilverMane> same
<Jazza> Then you can do it all day long
<SilverMane> Of Mares and Magic finished with epilogue
<Xiagu|Inkscape> [22:43]	<Blums>	Well cabbage luna was introduced from the very start of the episode so they could have left that only part out?
<Aponymous> There is a FMA crossover on EQD, I never read it though.
<NewDCD> 9so did One Last Quest
<drf|laptop> 03Dakota
<FreezeFrame> I'm not huge on Twixie fics
<drf|laptop> 03I've been on TV like 3 times
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<SilverMane> yeah
<D_man> >Idort friend links to one rule 34 pic as he often does. >i clikc to see wtf it is, probably laugh at it as normally do. >my face when I see this one rule34 artwork. >instaclose, but idea + picture burned into my eyes. >Am I becoming attracted to ponies? Of course not! I'd never do that! ... I don't want to do that
<Xiagu|Inkscape> people couldn't see the invisible comma between cabbage and luna
<Aeroslash> good fer you Danny
<SilverMane> D_Man, don't make me link you Fun For Two Fillies, starring Twilight and Rainbow Dash
<FreezeFrame> Maybe it's because my fanon is that Twilight and Trixie are sisters or cousins.
<D_man> Do it silvermane
<GGgala> D_man hahaha
<drf|laptop> 03way to be a jerk about it
<AtomicBrony> Okay MrPoniator Tannen
<Xiagu|Inkscape> Would that sentence have been clearer if I had put quotes between between and cabbage and cabbage and and and and and luna and after luna?
<junh1024-XD> lol
<GGgala> didn't that happen with Friendship is Sexy last week?
<Mongoose> oh yeah
<drf|laptop> 03what really pissed me off though
<Mongoose> I can't wait
<AtomicBrony> That joke made about as much sense a screen door on a battleship.
<drf|laptop> 03when I 8was in London, right
<D_man> PEOPLE- Y U SPEND FKING HOURS MAKING SUCH 'good' PICTURES OR FKING PONIES?
<drf|laptop> 03the parade was being broadcast basically all ove rthe world
<SilverMane> D_man, i don't have it. i was bluffing. basically, it's involving dash getting to explore her OTHER side
<MrPoniator> I know
<D_man> gggala - yes ;__;
<FreezeFrame> Actually, my preferred shipping is Rarijack
<drf|laptop> 03and when the camera panned to where I was, the sun glared off a tuba and blocked my face :(
<D_man> read half of part 1 and was like ...dont trust mahself with this
<Blums> it keeps the space flies out of the airlock
<drf|laptop> 03so i'm like "There's my body right there, but um, you can't really see me"
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<SilverMane> RariJack was my first ship, in Swayback Mountain
<Zeptometer> Atomicbrony LOL
<AtomicBrony> ...not that kind of battleship.
<D_man> silvermane ... other? with colt or filly i've seen 'em all...well not em all, but many
<AtomicBrony> Like, the water kind.
<GGgala> D_man you have stared into the abyss and the abyss is clopping to yuo
<drf|laptop> 03it's still fun to say I was on international television though
<Zeptometer> ... thats what I was thinking
<D_man> I don't really ship much other than spike and rarity kinda, but rarity doesn't seem interested
<Zeptometer> what other kind of battleship is there?
*Xiagu|Inkscape 's sentence was grammatically correct
<D_man> GGgala I KNOW! I MUST FIGHT IT
<AtomicBrony> Space battle ship.
<D_man> I DON'T WANT IT BUT IT WANTS ME
<Zeptometer> oh
<Dermathil> GO GURREN LAGANN
<Blums> oh.. keeps the seaweed out of the cooling system?
<FreezeFrame> Haven't read Swayback Mountain, but I did like A Bedtime Secret and Rarity's Rodeo
<D_man> A PART OF ME WANTS, BUT LIKE 5% ONLY. I MUST FIGHT ITTTT I DON'T WANT
<Dermathil> GIVE EM A TASTE OF THEIR MEDICINE
<SilverMane> D_Man, twilight finds a spell book, creates gender that matters, Dash gets penis, then they fuck. it was a comic-hentai-line
<Cracky> You coulda jsut said screen doors on a spaceship
<Zeptometer> blums dont try to make sense out of it
<AtomicBrony> ...
<Blums> he didnt mean space ship
<Cracky> Even though those do technicaly make sense
<AtomicBrony> YOU ALL SUCK.
<^Stargazer> hum, I can't wait till the day ED has a post showing the airdates of Season 2... that will be a day to behold lol
<D_man> silvermane -- ....... fuck. 2 girls on each other like that used to really turn me on.
<^Stargazer> I don't suck :(
<HolyJunkie> The space ship with the space guns that shoot the space bullets in space?
<AtomicBrony> MrPoniator and I are going back to our homes to watch "Back to the Future" again.
<Zeptometer> ^stargazer this
<SilverMane> SwayBack Mountain is by Butterscotch Sundae. and A Bedtime Secret, interesting
<D_man> Y PEOPLE DO DIS? CREATE 'really good artwork with impressive touches' OF FKING PPONIES FKINC FUCKING EACH OTHER >_<
<Blums> Yes holy Junkie, and its powered by turbofan engines
<MrPoniator> Why that movie?
<Cracky> Because, you don;'t want loose bits to be blown aroudn the whole ship by your ventalation system
<Fassad_McDuck> *whacks everyone with a deactivated beam katana*
<AtomicBrony> ...
<Cracky> thus i predict spaceships will have screen doors
<NewDCD> 9D_man: it's called freedom of expression
<Zeptometer> MrPoniator because it's amazing
<Aponymous> Because internet/science
<D_man> that goes for very descriptive, 'colourful' fics too
<SilverMane> i dunno, i haven't ooked at any X-rated stuff of ponies in a long time
<Zeptometer> duh
<AtomicBrony> "Make like a tree and get out of here?"
<Dermathil> >mfw I think I saw the comic Silvermane mentionned already. Accidentally. Because Ponibooru decided to derp its filters
<AtomicBrony> "Screen door on a battleship?"
<D_man> NewDCD - i'm not against it i find it hillarious and awesome that people do this
<AtomicBrony> "HELLO, MCFLY?!"
<D_man> i'm just worried for myself now
<HolyJunkie> No... SPACE... ENGINES...
*SilverMane going to read Maturity now
<FreezeFrame> SilverMane: Rarity's Rodeo is by Somber.
<MrPoniator> Ah, okay
<Fassad_McDuck> make like a bannana and leave
<AtomicBrony> And because it's awesome.
<Blums> what? turbofan engines are totally viable on a spaceship
<Cracky> Oh, I was AFK, i only cvaught the battleship one
<Cracky> which is not obvious
<FreezeFrame> Maturity is good. Just finished reading it a bit ago.
<Aponymous> I find FiM rule 34/clopfics freakin' hilarious.
<SilverMane> D_man, it's just a matter of saying no. I have gained excellent self control regarding that due to ponies
<SilverMane> same Aponymous
<Cracky> wait, you never said make like a tree
<SilverMane> Spreading Your Wings, and Hers was epic though
<Cracky> until just then
<Cracky> ooh he did
<MrPoniator> I thought you were being sarcastic
<D_man> silvermane - i read that one
<Cracky> i wasnt here for that
<MrPoniator> hence, "I know"
<Cracky> anywyas
<SilverMane> '7.Her tongue slipped into his mouth and he shared a long blissful kiss with her that seemed to go on forever. She broke off and stepped away from him. She stood with her flank facing the dragon, turned her violet-maned head and gave him a sultry look.'
<Zeptometer> no, he said Make a tree and get out of here cracky
<D_man> made me lul so much. that's what I used to be like
<Cracky> i think i'm talking to myself now
<drf|laptop> 03http://oi54.tinypic.com/1zqwxoy.jpg
<Cracky> he said
<D_man> but now lately it's less luls and more pomfs ;__; but i don't want this
<Cracky> but not him
<Cracky> it was the other him
<Blums> im confused now
<MrPoniator> Because I quote movies without knowing where the quotes come from, I'm just that
<Cracky> not hthe first him
<Zeptometer> oh. right
<D_man> silvermane D: Y
<AtomicBrony> See, when MrPoniator said that, I immediately conjured up Biff from "Back to the Future," because he always screws up those lines
<AtomicBrony> Hence the "screen door on a battleship" reply
<Zeptometer> WHATS GOING ON?
<Fassad_McDuck> make like Mr. Sir Henry Mo- *notices the rating* ...and... i don't know where this joke was going.
<SoftlySweptAway> i dont know
<FireLadyPhoenix> Not a clue
<Zeptometer> okay. moving on then
<AtomicBrony> We're ****ing up euphamisms.
<SilverMane> lol
<AtomicBrony> That's what.
<MrPoniator> I have been watching movies too much with Finnish subtitles to pay attention what they actually say
<SilverMane> it's from Maturity
<FireLadyPhoenix> Awesome
<Zeptometer> Luna is not a Cabbage because that makes no sense.
<Zeptometer> now that we have that settled.
<Fassad_McDuck> *munches on a cabbage*
<Aponymous> It's only that one paragraph. I liked Maturity. SGR does good Spike stories.
<SilverMane> D_man, you just need to get to the point of Bronydom where teh ponies are no longer a thing, but rather a part of your life
<Cracky> Cabbages are delicous, because that makes perfect sense!
<FreezeFrame> It's a dream sequence
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Fassad_McDuck> DELICIOUS
<Glacymr> 12:P
<Zeptometer> so you're saying Luna tastes delicious?
<D_man> silvermane i know lol read that whole fic. was actually interesting - what WILL happen to spike
*Jazza crawls on Mongoose and rests...
<D_man> ?
<Cracky> No
<Zanzil> You guys wanna get high? don't forget your towel.
<Cracky> Luna is not a Cabbage
<FireLadyPhoenix> Towlie!
<FreezeFrame> Honestly, my main requirement for shipfics is that the relationships are done well
<Glacymr> 12could have been worse drf
<D_man> Silvermane - implying not already since ages ago
<Zeptometer> gtg
<MrPoniator> Hell, I didn't even notice they spoke (broken) Finnish in Charlie's angels because I was reading the subtitles
*Mongoose holds Jazza close to him
<Glacymr> 12wb LMH
<^Stargazer> Luna is cabbage wut?
<Fassad_McDuck> ...you're a towel.
<Blums> We will make luna a cabbage
<Cracky> luna is NOT a ccabbage
*HyperMetalLugia derps
<Cracky> you see
<^Stargazer> Luna is pure awesomeness, that is all
<HyperMetalLugia> THanks :P
<Zanzil> Luna's a towel?
<^Stargazer> well, pure awesomeness with a god side of cute
<drf|laptop> 03I gave them a 20% warning level then blocked them
<drf|laptop> 03after that
<Blums> or.. maybe we'll just have luna wear a cabbage
<FireLadyPhoenix> South Park reference
<Blums> or eat a cabbage
<drf|laptop> 03see, proof I'm not perverted enough to just click on random porn links :P
<D_man> but silvermane - lately less 'lol look at that it's funny because of how ridiculous it is as they're ponies / wow that's some neato artwork / fic,' and now it's more and more *pomf*. WHY.jpg
<Dermathil> When there's ship in a fic I can't have it be the focus of the story.
<NewDCD> 9Time to Banish some fuckers.
<FreezeFrame> Maybe it's because I'm a big sappy romantic.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or it'll infect your PC ;P
<D_man> TO THE MOON
<Dermathil> Like the Pony Psychology series. That one I like a real lot.
<Zanzil> I should put a reference in a flash video...
<^RainbowDash> Luna + cabbage = get it done.
<Cracky> Cabbage -> Delicious
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Everyone tries the link in the image
<D_man> i read that one, loved it
<NewDCD> 9BINNISHED.
<SoftlySweptAway> why not lettuce?
<D_man> BONNOSHED TO THO MOON
<Cracky> Cabbag -> ¬Luna
<FireLadyPhoenix> And dressing
<AtomicBrony> Fluttershy being a tree doesn't make any more sense than Luna being a cabbage
<Cracky> also
<Cracky> Luna -> ¬Cabbage
<AtomicBrony> Only difference is that it was stated in the show
<Blums> because cabbage merchant from avatar
<^Stargazer> why you be dissing my luna
<^Stargazer> ?
<^Stargazer> =/
<Jazza> Fluttershy said she wants to be a tree
<FireLadyPhoenix> MY CABBAGES
<FreezeFrame> The Ditzy/Derpy chapter was interesting.
<D_man> latest one? not read it yet
<Cracky> THEREFORE
<NewDCD> 9time for Valkyrie/Veritech, mofos
<D_man> got it open in a tab rite now :3
<Dermathil> haven't read the Derpy chapter yet
<FreezeFrame> Read it. Now.
<Cracky> Luna may or may not be delicious
<SoftlySweptAway> so fluttershy would technically be a furry in the pony world
<Fassad_McDuck> *munch*
<Cracky> Cabbages are not sufficent evidence for either hypothisis
<Xiagu|Inkscape> Fluttershy is /not/ a tree, silly. She'd /like/ to be a tree. Fluttertree is a tree.
*^Stargazer sweatdrops
<Dermathil> I got an ipod. I'll use it.
<Fassad_McDuck> ...she's a cabbage.
<Dermathil> DAT MECH
<AtomicBrony> ...
<FireLadyPhoenix> On a completely different note AdultSwim voted us less creepy than furries
<MrPoniator> I'm a stone
<Blums> Pony cabbages
<Dermathil> Now that is an awesome mech too.
<FreezeFrame> I've been downloading the PDF version of Past Sins to my nook.
<^Stargazer> if fluttershy would like to be a tree, what would butterscotch want to be?
<Tenaris> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eXnY12ZCP4 metal gear plus space =0
<Xiagu|Inkscape> It's true! We're more creepy than the word moist, though. :c
<Jazza> We're not creepier than furries
*AtomicBrony goes back to his bucket.
<Jazza> Wait... what do that make furry bronies?
<Dermathil> Code Geass?
<Blums> just shop pony heads sticking out of the cabbages from the cabbage merchant from avatar
<Fassad_McDuck> fluttershy is tree man.
<FireLadyPhoenix> LESS creepy, officially stated on AdultSwim
<Blums> furries? no we're cabbies
<Jazza> "MY CABBAGES!"
<Xiagu|Inkscape> MY CABBAGES!
<D_man> Gode Ceass
<Aponymous> Overkill?
*AtomicBucket is now a bucket.
<Dermathil> Is that Code Geass?
<NewDCD> 9eyup
<Fassad_McDuck> tree powers, ACTIVATE!
<Dermathil> ah
*Jazza brohooves Xiagu and Blums
<^Stargazer> cabbage patch kids are cabbages
<Aponymous> OH SNAP ITS ALIVE!
<MrPoniator> I want such a comfy bucket as Atomic's
<Xiagu|Inkscape> inb4 herdmind
<Dermathil> so that guy was whatsisname.
<SoftlySweptAway> is moist such a bad word
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Garys Mod Pony Video Event! (http://tinyurl.com/3lo3eh3)
<MrPoniator> Do they sell 'em anywhere?
<Dermathil> The evil guy.
<Fassad_McDuck> moist
<SilverMane> I'm trying to print off every fanfic i can, and i'm going ot put them all in a box
*Xiagu|Inkscape returns brohoof
<^Stargazer> =D!!!
<Blums> moist, supervillan extrordinate
<^RainbowDash> Ooh!
*Blums returns brohoof aswell
<^Stargazer> they're confusing me Xiagu
<MrPoniator> Welp, Tenari posted something Valve related and now we get something valve related from EqD
<SilverMane> and then if someone wants to know what i did with my life, i can hand them 200 pounds of pony fic
<FreezeFrame> Also, since I mentioned Rarity's Rodeo, some of Somber's other fics have the [Sad] tag. Do not underestimate that tag.
<AtomicBucket> Every bucket comes with a bucket
<Dermathil> What are their titles?
<Aponymous> BIG O!
<^Stargazer> hahahaha
<SilverMane> I love [sad] stories, and i do mean LOVE. I don't know why, bu ti just can't not read them
<^Stargazer> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a7pfDQurNKE/TioPNwGm4AI/AAAAAAAAI_I/cB7auas2G-4/s1600/atg_2__derpmes_by_tess_27-d41673k.png
<Tenaris> =D
<AtomicBucket> And every bucket that comes with a bucket is free.
<Dermathil> GO BIG O
<^Stargazer> Derpy is epic!
<Fassad_McDuck> but not water.
<AtomicBucket> So, free bucket.
<MrPoniator> Is that a bundle deal?
<NewDCD> 9Mane, print mine
<SilverMane> if it makes me cry, all the better. i find it hard to cry at real life things
<Zanzil> The only thing better than a bucket... Is a bucket handle
<FreezeFrame> Simply Rarity; Blood, Sweat and Tears
<MrPoniator> There's a song in Finnish
<Aponymous> I try to avoid sad stories, I occasionally make exceptions though.
<Fassad_McDuck> water is 50$ a bucket
<alphaJackal> okay, i'm back
<SilverMane> omfg, read both of those FreezeFrame
<SilverMane> loved them
<D_man> lol silvermane
<MrPoniator> "Drop doesn't kill, and you can't drown in a bucket"
<FreezeFrame> Loved them, too, but was bawling my eyes out.
<spyro17> hello
<Dermathil> never heard of em FF.
<D_man> and silvermane i'm now looking for the twi rainbowdassh one curse yoouuuuu>_<
<SilverMane> Simply Rarity was... beautiful
<Zanzil> I'd disagree with that ^
<MrPoniator> Guess Atomic's bucket prevents drowning
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, I doubt it would be able to give me viruses, I have Malwarebytes :P
<FreezeFrame> And you know exactly where the waterworks came on Simply Rarity.
<Dermathil> DAI-GUARD
<SilverMane> it's not fanfic D_man, it was a comic-esque hentai thingy
<Dermathil> GO
<AtomicBucket> It has a lid
<D_man> o...k...silvermane...
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay MB
<^Stargazer> if you wear it properly under water a bucket can be used as an airpocket
<Fassad_McDuck> *munches on the sandwich of your defeat*
*HyperMetalLugia downloads it
<SilverMane> FreezeFrame, it wasn't Unique's... finale that made me cry FreezeFrame, it was... the happier bits
<SilverMane> at the end
<Aponymous> He got the point *Shoots self*
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Dakota> My dad's interview is supposed to be playing a continous loop in the 4-H, so we'll walk in and every will be like: OMG! YOUR DAD'S A CELIBERTY! AAAAAAAH! That will be annoying.
<drf|laptop> 03you have to register it to get the real-time antivirus
<SilverMane> oh good, a new corpse to write shipfic with!
<GGgala> wait i missed a bit of the stream - did they show who was the mysterious shadowy guy?
<NewDCD> 9yeah that was Asakim
*Nittany_Tiger is never interested in sex or "Shipping"
<Mongoose> I like bucket
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, but I'm fine with the regular xD
<NewDCD> 9we played a bit with him yesterday
<MrPoniator> You like the concept of a bucket?
<NewDCD> 9a nerfed version of him, but yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> At least I have the chance to ruin Windows 7 first :P
<FreezeFrame> Shipping simply refers to any sort of romantic relationships
<Blums> but you cant tilt the bucket at all
<Dakota> (4-H building at Iowa State Fair. Yaaaaay.
<D_man> asakim! yes!
<Nittany_Tiger> I know what it means.
<AtomicBrony> I like to take that concept and reduce it to an object
*SilverMane thinks Nittany_Tiger is missing out on some of the greatest fics there are. If you want non-sexy shipping, i can find some good ones
<AtomicBrony> I like to take that object and put it in my videos
<Mongoose> and put it in my videos
<nickstr> you have to scan EVERY DAY then
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't want Shipping. Most of it is probably lesbian.
<Zanzil> Mongoose link one of your videos
<Zanzil> i'm bored
<Zanzil> i'll watch
<Nittany_Tiger> Since MLP's cast is mostly female.
<Blums> Moskau, Moskay, La la la la la la la, la la la la la la, ho ho ho ho ho, HEY!
<Mongoose> I don't have any
<NewDCD> 9I write shipping. Straight Shipping, that is.
*NewDCD 9wrote an alt end to Ships that Pass the Night
<Mongoose> but I will link one my favorites
<MrPoniator> Ponibooru why y no work
<MrPoniator> Same goes for bronibooru
<D_man> But newdcd you don't like clop fics, right? "that shit's not cool nigga" right?
<Aponymous> I'm writing a weird ass Spike/Rarity fic about murder.
<FreezeFrame> I love parodies of some of the excesses of shipping.
<MrPoniator> And I need pictures of scootaloo, dangit
<Zanzil> Lame got excited
<NewDCD> 9yeah, the stuff I write is pretty tame
<FreezeFrame> Like the two parodies of "Rainbow Dash ships with everypony"
<NewDCD> 9I like romance, that's it. I've always been a hopeless romantic.
<Nittany_Tiger> I haven't started my "disaster" fic.
<Mongoose> Scootaloo....
<Mongoose> I could give you Scootagoose
<HyperMetalLugia> I haven't scanned in weeks
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, I don't want to call it a "disaster" fic.
<MrPoniator> I need dem scootaloo
<HyperMetalLugia> And I haven't had a virus in years
<HyperMetalLugia> Just sayin'
<NewDCD> 9mine is sort of a war fic
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not aiming for a Ronald Emmerich-type deal.

<Aponymous> You should, it's pretty good.

*AtomicSleepy goes bed
<Dermathil> yeah.
<D_man> that one's ... yea happy somehow
<Zanzil> No I thought this chat would help me write something
<Dermathil> Because He eventually unfreezes the Statue Rarity
<^RainbowDash> AtomicBrony just went to bed
<FreezeFrame> I d'awwed with an eyebrow cocked.
<D_man> that he'll undo spell and die with her is just such poetic justice :3
<Dermathil> and dies happily both with eachother.
<^RainbowDash> User_7301 just left
<Whompman9000> that's good?
<MrPoniator> He became a bed
<NewDCD> 9we still need Super Pony Wars
<Balloons> Lack of ponies if anything.

<Aponymous> FreezeFrame: I was there for the thread that spawned that story! It was hilarious! (The thread I mean)
*Paul_McColtney Screams at AtomicSleepy

<Whompman9000> Yes
<Blums> Who is the least developed of the mane cast?
<SilverMane> A Summer Twilight, one of the hardest hitting stories i've read
<drf|laptop> 03sigh
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<FreezeFrame> Circle of Friends is happy tears
<drf|laptop> 03forgot my laptop was on battery

<D_man> but it so sad
<^RainbowDash> Applejack.
<Balloons> Where!?
<HyperMetalLugia> And I guess it died? .x.
<D_man> GARRYS MOD VIDEO EVENT ON EQD Yes!
<D_man> Bene
<SilverMane> i love me some sadfics, they get me thinking possitively instead of the happy fics making me depressed
<Dermathil> This Gundam Pilot makes me think of Lelouch for some reason.
<FreezeFrame> Really?
<Mongoose> I like tia
<FreezeFrame> That's kinda weird
<SilverMane> Denied, that's A Summer Twilight
*^RainbowDash points in the same random direction as before "There!"

<NewDCD> 9also Dman yfw you realize you can't go sleep
<Anal> Hey look, ponies!
<HyperMetalLugia> Hibernation everywhere*
<SilverMane> FreezeFrame, it's because i have extreme empathetic tendencies. The emotions i feel in the stories, if written well enough, become real; the fact that they are fake hits hard once m ymind realizes it, and thus depression ensues after extreme happiness
<Ridley> Huhwhat?
*Blums points to rainbow dash
<Ridley> SOUP'S UP
<Jazza> Anal... what a nick name
<Blums> EVEYPONY
<Mongoose> I want soup

<HyperMetalLugia> Fun :p
*DerpyBot walks away with a drooping tail
*NewDCD 9Random Trivia: Sometimes in this game, when performing that attack, the GL pilots will yell "SUPER INAZUMA KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK"
<RainbowDashie> Bigmac, did you flee from the adventure?
<Mongoose> Fast pony makes mongoose angry
<BigMac> no
<BigMac> I was off doing it6

*RainbowDashie douses Ridley in moofuns.

<Dman> GGgala yes, Other M is brilliant. not the best, but a very good game nonethelless.
<NewDCD> 9but Other M was pretty good from a gameplay perspective
<^RainbowDash> Why do you keep doing this, Scootaloo? it's just not healthy!!
<NewDCD> 9it doesn't deserve half of the hate it gets
<Dman> it's very japanese in its storytelling which made many american players dislike it : /

<Dermathil> The general reader feedback wasn't good.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL Glacymr
<Aponymous> The authors nephew or whatever deleted it from everywhere he posted it.

<Locke> Yeah?
<^BonBon> Oh lighten up Rainbow Dash I was only ribbing you.
<Dman> aww...
<BrightWing> Scoot Scootaloo!
*ScootScootaloo "Gee, Dash. I'm sure glad the dye washes out."
<Dermathil> And that was because Sethisto put it up without going through prereaders.
<^RainbowDash> Pfft.
<Ridley> !flip
<NewDCD> 9Dashite: I mean "the Wii doesn't have enough good games"
<Glacymr> 12watch there be an 80 dollar card in there
*DerpyBot flies up in the air and does a backflip
*DerpyBot lands on her back. Ouch!
<^Stargazer> Locke = FFVI's best character IMO
<Retsamoreh> Get back to the Island, you noob.
<ScootScootaloo> skehehhehe
<Ridley> !Flip
*DerpyBot flies up in the air and does a backflip
*DerpyBot lands on her back. Ouch!
<Ridley> ?
<Pyroh> Ok thats it, i dont care if its done or not, i do NOT need more images
<Ridley> aw
<Ridley> I'm sorry, DerpyBot
*^RainbowDash looks to her side defiantly.
<Dman> i keep stopping + deleting recording
<Pyroh> ANYWAYS!
<Dashite> Doesn't have enough good games, or doesn't have enough games that you want?
<Dman> when stuff go down?
<^BonBon> Not like that dear.
<NewDCD> 9have you seen the Wii the last year and a half? The influx of new, good games is very rare
<Dman> may be 12 there, but is 6am here
<Dermathil> NewDCD: Super Mario Galaxy (1, not 2. 2 SUCKED for being a cash-grab) was great.
<Dashite> Yeah, it's died down this past year.
<Dman> NewDCD i agree
<NewDCD> 9dude, the Wii is Shovelware Heaven. Don't try to deny this.
<Dashite> Galaxy 2 > 1
<Dman> NDS and Wii haven't had much last year and a half
<Dermathil> but I agree the last year was CRAP.
<Dermathil> No purchase.
*^BonBon switches to Call of the Cutie voice
*^RainbowDash crosses her forehooves, holding herself upright with her wings.
<Dman> LIKE the last good ds game was GHOST TRICK (amazing game) LIKE A YEAR AGO
<^BonBon> But id my voice really as bad as you say?
<Dashite> I'm not denying that there is a metric fuck ton of shovelware on the system. There are good games on it as well.
<^Stargazer> you sound just fine bonbon
<Nittany_Tiger> This year in gaming half-sucks.
<Dermathil> GO DAI-GUARD
<NewDCD> 9what bothers me is that they're getting ready to replace the Wii already
*Ridley has no wings
<^Stargazer> don't think lyra would have it any other way too
*Retsamoreh is a floating box
<Dashite> It's been 5 years...
<FreezeFrame> Dman: That's a weird way of spelling Okamiden
<Locke> A ridly withought wings is more of a raptor
<^BonBon> Oh but raaaainnn bow daaash saaaiiid It was stuuuuuuupiiiiiddd
<NewDCD> 9when a good-games quota hasn't been reached. In comparison, the Gamecube had a lot of good games
<Dman> i bought cowadoodee for xbawx and then downloaded for wii. i have wii zapper (amazon deal for 1 quid with links crosswbow trainan) . I enjoyed wii ver a LOT more
*^RainbowDash looks at her first with an "I dunno...Is it?" look, and switches to an "Mmm, yeah." look.
<FreezeFrame> And it was definitely less than a year ago
*^BonBon starts fake-crying
<^Stargazer> she's just jealous
<Dermathil> yeah, newdcd.
<Pyroh> OOoooo hi BonBon, didnt see you there

<Dman> FreezeFrame lol. I haven't actually played akomiden but never played okai
<^RainbowDash> Jealous?
<NewDCD> 9plus Dashite, have you seen the bunch of pictures about people's Wiis collecting dust in the net?
<Dman> okamiden okami *
<^BonBon> she haaates meeee... *boo hoo*
<NewDCD> 9doesn't that tell you something?
<Locke> jelly?
<^RainbowDash> My voice is AWESOME.
<NewDCD> 9The Wii is a commercial success
<Pyroh> ummmmm
<Pyroh> >_>
<Nittany_Tiger> Play Okami. It's great.
<Pyroh> Nevermind
<Dman> cuz i played 2 hours of okami and was all 'hmm ok'
<^RainbowDash> She's just... Snotty.
<NewDCD> 9but the greatest failure in history from a core gamer perspective
<Dman> it seemed like a well thoguht out and polished game thats for sure
*^BonBon breaks into more tears
<NewDCD> 9hence why I shifted more towards my PSP and PC
<Glacymr> 12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev3VwmpBXyo
<^BonBon> you're just a big meaaaaniieee
<Dashite> That is pure and utter bullshit.

<NewDCD> 9and hten
<NewDCD> 9when GOOD games come for the console
<Dman> NewDCD - i am very jelly i know nothing about PSP homebrewan at ALL
<NewDCD> 9Reggie fucks us up
<NewDCD> 9so yeah.
<Dermathil> IT isn't like the Wii seems to be headed for going out in a bang like the N64 with PAPER MARIO.
<Dman> yup
*^Stargazer nods at BonBon
<Dashite> With the exception of this past year, if you haven't been able to find something that you wanted to play on the Wii, it was your own fault.
<Dman> p'haps
*Retsamoreh chucks a pinecone at BonBon's face
<usatt1337> hey everyone
<Dman> last year i have bought nothing
<Dashite> They've messed up this past year for sure.
<^BonBon> Oh thank you Retsamoreh, you're my only real friend
<NewDCD> 9yeah, me and thousands of other gamers
*Ridley is a clever girl
<Retsamoreh> I hope you explode!
<Dman> and downloaded cod, justdance1/2 for sister (haven't played 1 second of them) and uh
<NewDCD> 9don't be such a fanboy. I remember when I was like you, trying to defend the Wii.
<Dermathil> actually, last year I got the two Resident evil games for wii.
<NewDCD> 9yet the Wii brought naught.
*^BonBon glomptackles retsamoreh I know you're just saying you love me!
<NewDCD> 9so I said "fuck this".
<Ridley> What's up with this Trixie eating pinecones nonsense?
<Dman> OH and brawl USA cuz brawl EU was / is so behind in cheats. so USA has codes now
<Retsamoreh> Someone! Stab her off of me!
<Locke> Pinecones are nutricous
*Ridley stabbity STAB stab
<Retsamoreh> Hellllppppp~
<Dermathil> wait wuh?!
<Dashite> Fanboy? I just don't like to see people shit on the console for having no games when that is clearly not true.
<Dermathil> CODES IN MY BRAWL?!
<NewDCD> 9and stopped defending it
<Ridley> Oh
<Zanzil> Ok I'm going to sleep
<Ridley> Well
<Dermathil> WHERE ARE THE SHEETS
<^BonBon> Whats the matter Retsamoreh? you want more hugs?
<Dman> DERMATHIL CODES ARE AMAYZAN
<NewDCD> 9don't get me wrong, kiddo
<Ridley> !Flip
*DerpyBot flies up in the air and does a backflip
*DerpyBot lands safely on her hooves
<NewDCD> 9the games that the Wii DOES have, I love
*^BonBon hugs harder
<NewDCD> 9but on the long run
<Locke> It's 2 bits a hug
*Glacymr runs from drf before he says "EW"
<NewDCD> 9the Wii is terrible.
*Retsamoreh flies up and hides in a tree
*^Stargazer droops head, feels a little depressed
<^BonBon> Youuu cant hide in there forever darling~
<NewDCD> 9and most of the Wii's good games are first-party stuff
<Dermathil> It just doesn't have enough games, is the ONLY non-HD console out there.
<Dman> DERMATHIL - FD WITH RAIN, BATTLEFIELD WITH POKEMON IN LAKE, HAUNTED MANSION SMASHVILLE, CUSTOM COLOURS, CUSTOM. FLIPPIN'. music.
<^Stargazer> eh... I guess I'll head off to bed now...
*^Stargazer yawns
<NewDCD> 9third-party support is faltering like you have no idea.
<Ridley> Now, which Locke are you? The philosopher or the cripple?
<NewDCD> 9and third-party support basically DEFINES a console.
<^BonBon> Good night stargazer
<Dman> >dat heartbeat sensor
<Denied_Existence> Welp, I got to sleep, touring some colleges tomorrow.
<Retsamoreh> Or the Demon?
<Dashite> Third party support is effectively dead.
*Ridley hugs ^Stargazer
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Dman> newdcd - this is y i have high hopes for wii U
<Umbreon> 12virus!
<Locke> Uh neither. I named him after the character in FF6
*^Stargazer feels better now ^^;;
<Dman> (mad)
*^BonBon looks up the tree
<Ridley> There ya go
<Ridley> :3
<Dman> shoot, ah'm tired
<^Stargazer> g'night all
<Dashite> And has been for most of its life cycle because nobody gave a shit about trying to make something decent.
<NewDCD> 9I'm not placing any hopes on any consoles till they deliver. That's my philosophy from now on.
<Dman> no brony bumping thread
<Dermathil> MACROSS
<NewDCD> 9I bet on the Wii, and it idssapointed me
<Dermathil> GO
<^BonBon> Retsamoreh just come down, I promise i wont hug you TOO hard
<Locke> Not that I ever actually played that game. I'm working on it.
<Dermathil> yeah.
<NewDCD> 9well Dashite, you just said the problem with the Wii.
<Dman> i like having high hopes, but i never buy consoles straight away
<NewDCD> 9yes, it has SOME games, but far too few.
<Dermathil> I guess I'll wait 'til I see the Xbox next console and the PS4.
<NewDCD> 9Ergo, from a core gamer's point of view, it was not too good of a purchase.
<Dman> but but newdcd - softmod = nes snes n64 gamecube wii
<drf|laptop> 03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pokmon-should-have-used-a-super-rod.gif
<Dermathil> I'm jumping off the Nintendo console.
<Dman> handhelds up to gameboy
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm not going to buy the next gen of consoles.
<Dman> and other old consoles
*^BonBon slaps on pony-cleats
<Locke> and now we are less awesome
<^BonBon> Dont make me come up there~
<NewDCD> 9which my computer can also play
<Dman> when story?
<Dman> o lol Kittan
<Nittany_Tiger> Not after Sony told me that I don't own my PS3.
<Dman> newdcd true dat
<Dman> gamecube thou?
<TapeDiggity> http://i.imgur.com/gyjJI.png
<NewDCD> 9and my computer's monitor is also my TV screen
<NewDCD> 9so yeah
<Dermathil> KITTAN KILLU
<NewDCD> 9Dman: Dolphin.
*Retsamoreh dumps a few pinecones on ^BonBon's head in defiance
<Dashite> If it is your only game, I can agree with that.
<TapeDiggity> There we go. Fixed my chat issues.
<Dman> I have about 5 disks with maybe 20 games
<Dashite> game machine*
<Dman> newdcd : my pc can't le dolphin ;__;
<^BonBon> I'll take that as a yes
<TapeDiggity> So who wants a sloppy sketch or two?
<Ridley> oh, not much. You draw that>?
<Locke> nuthin much twilight
<Pizzicato> Hello.
*^BonBon stabs hooves into tree, slowly climbing to Retsamoreh
<Ridley> Hey, i wouldn't mind some art
<Dman> also, i am loving latest brawl shiz: use savefile, record gameplay on pc dolphin
<Pizzicato> I'll draw you some art.
<Locke> Cleats totally work that way
<Dman> dolphin can upscale
<Pizzicato> I can't draw, but.
<Ridley> :D
<Pizzicato> That won't stop me.
<Ridley> I should draw some ponies too
<NewDCD> 9but yeah, Dashite, most of the game community agree that the Wii was a huge dissapointment.
<TapeDiggity> I'll do anything non-explicit, as long as you don't mind my tiredness and whatnot.
<NewDCD> 9And these are Wii owners
<Pizzicato> I mean, I can, but both my handwriting and artistic skills are that of a six year old.
*Retsamoreh floats out of the tree and on top of the nearest building
<NewDCD> 9not the typical PS3HASNOGAEMS guys
<Locke> I draw, but my cousin has my sketch book
<Dman> THERES A MESSED UP CONCEPT. NINTENDO, A BUNCHAFANS MAKE A PROGRAM FOR FREE THAT UPSCALES WII GAMES. Y U NO WII U UPSCALE WII GAMES? EH? EH? riddle me that, gentlemen.
<TapeDiggity> I gotta get some practice, and I wanna make people happy in the process.
<Retsamoreh> TapeDiggety.
<TapeDiggity> Yessir.
<Ridley> I'm sure, Pizzicato, that whatever you create is lovely
<NewDCD> 9if you aren't, that's nice for you, but really, it doesn't change the facts.
<Retsamoreh> Draw Rets on Twilight's back.
<Locke> I would link to my DA if no one minds
<TapeDiggity> ...
<Pizzicato> my mom likes it, Ridley.
<Dman> i agree to all the facts and enjoy every console :3
<Retsamoreh> wait
<Ridley> And, gee, I dunno. How bout some Pinkie Pie or Gummy or something?
<TapeDiggity> Is it bad that I don't know who Rets is?
<NewDCD> 9the worst part is
<Retsamoreh> This is Rets
<Retsamoreh> http://the-time-hero.deviantart.com/favourites/#/d41wcbl
<NewDCD> 9that the best Wii games have gotten ported or will soon be XD
<Retsamoreh> A rather moody and cynical box.
<NewDCD> 9aside from the first party ones, that is.
<Pizzicato> Ooh I can buy a print!
<Dman> NewDCD - you have no idea how much my heart sank with goldeneye xboxps3 trailer
<Locke> You're.... a box
<NewDCD> 9I never saw it
<Retsamoreh> Yes, and they're talking ponies.
<Dermathil> ^^
<Retsamoreh> Don't act so friggin surprised.
<NewDCD> 9is it basically the Wii GoldenEye in those consoles?
<Dashite> Basically.
<Dermathil> Yeah
<Dman> the only differences i saw were glass shattering is improved, and when you reload the background doesn't blur so as to allow the wii to process animation
<Dman> Yes NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9cause the Wii GoldenEye is...decent, but pretty much Cawadoodie with Bond
<^BonBon> *appears behind Retsamoreh* I think you're the type who enjoys hugs with lots of spikes *reveals her leather jacket lined with razor blades*
<Dman> not even graphical update at all
*Ridley doesn't know WHAT he is
<Dman> ya it's cawadoodie bond, and SUPER SHORT grr
<Nittany_Tiger> IT's published by Activision.
<Dashite> And fake Bond.
<Dman> didn't buy
<Dman> friend bought thou. silly him.
<Nittany_Tiger> There's your reason.
<Retsamoreh> But yes, Rets resting on the back of a rather disgruntled looking Twilight would be nice.
<Dermathil> LELOUCH
<Dman> when moment in storyline?
<Ridley> Disgruntled Twilight. Band name?
<Dermathil> after those kills
<NewDCD> 9I'm thinking of getting a capture card to stream Disaster: Day of Crisis though
<Dman> tis 6 30 and i'll probs be woken up at like 8 9 10ish
<Locke> Well here is my DA if anypony or box is interested
<Flamerunner> heya tom is bob, from the office down the hall.
<Locke> http://exranion.deviantart.com/
<Dermathil> when the Getten monsters are dead
<TapeDiggity> Okay, got it. Box on Twilight, then Pinkie/Gummy. I'll do my best.
<Flamerunner> it's good t see you buddy how've you been
<NewDCD> 9Disaster and the NMH series are pretty much the reason to own a Wii
<Dermathil> and the gunmen
<Dman> newdcd - sounds like a plan
<Retsamoreh> Have fun!
<Flamerunner> things have been okay for mee except that i'm a zombie now
<Dashite> You mean other than first party.
<TapeDiggity> Except that you're a zombie now?
<Dman> oh haven't played NMH yet
<Ridley> yay!
<Flamerunner> i'd really wish you let us in.
<Dashite> First party is always the reason to own a nintendo console.
<Ridley> Thank you TapeDiggety!
<Dman> 's on mah list
<BlacklightShining> I think I speak for all of us
<BlacklightShining> When I say I understand
<Ridley> Diggity*
<NewDCD> 9never could enjoy Mario. But yeah, that's tacit and not necessary to mention.
<BlacklightShining> Why you folks might hesitate
<TapeDiggity> Don't thank me yet. Doin' it's always the hard part.

<NewDCD> 9 3rd Party Support in the DS and GBA was great, and the GC too
<Dashite> No More Heroes.

<Dashite> My main gaming machine is my PC.

<Locke> I was actually thinking of doing Pony/Need for Speed
<BlacklightShining> We're not unreasonable
<Nittany_Tiger> I have a PS3 for free online play, but I don't play online much anymore.
<BlacklightShining> I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes
<NewDCD> 9nowadays my PC is that, too. And well, my PSP always delivers.
<Mongoose> Re: Your brians
<Locke> I was just going to work the alternate universe angle

<BlacklightShining> We're at an impasse here
<Dermathil> DAT DYNAMISM
<BlacklightShining> Maybe we should compromise
<Nittany_Tiger> What?
<BlacklightShining> If you open up the door
<Locke> Now that I think of it where is the left 4 dead cross over
<Dashite> Still don't like the dual shock...
<Flamerunner> i'm surprised
<Flamerunner> not to say offended
<BlacklightShining> We'll all come inside and eat your brains!
<Dman> what does black/white and colour mean on characters btw?

<Dman> i love my ps2
<Pyroh> But at least i have food :3
<Nittany_Tiger> Mine don't.
<Locke> I'm writing a story that's a loos cross over with Valkryia Chronichles.
<Dman> but ME, i hit my thumbs when with left stick i go right, while also, with right stick going left.
<Mongoose> I would write it
<Mongoose> but I have no talent
<Locke> It's not really a cross over but it has enough for me to at least call it a loose cross over.
<Dashite> If I leave my thumbs on top of the sticks they collide.
<Pyroh> MMMMMMMMMMMMM, taste so good :3
<Flamerunner> Mongoose
<Flamerunner> Give it a shot
<Pyroh> ...

<Locke> I have average skill in a lot things, but good at nothing.

<Pyroh> yum yum
<Mongoose> I have nothing better to do

<Nittany_Tiger> I honestly don't have a controller preference.
<NewDCD> 9and I could stream ACE COMBAT

<Locke> It's a PS3 game.

<Dman> ofc newdcd, after i sleepan
<Dman> :P
<Locke> If you played Valkryia chronichles they manage to do a war story with out ever being that dark about it.
<Dermathil> sorry nah
<Mistipulate> Wait... that means some of them are good.
<TapeDiggity> Yeah, I think I've had that comin' for a while. I ain't surprised.

<Pyroh> I mean we dont talk for weeks unless i say anything
<Dman> and my cat woke up
<Pyroh> So i told her i was going to remove her from my friends list and she said she would start talking to me again
<Mistipulate> Equestria, not Earth...
<TapeDiggity> I think that's a pretty common occurrence for Internet correspondents, Pyroh.
<Dermathil> GO KING KITTAN!!! GO GET THE KILL
<Locke> rhen talk to her instead
<Pyroh> Should i let her try to start talking to me
<Pyroh> Or just leave
<TapeDiggity> People just wanna have some privacy sometimes.
<Dman> FINISHING MOVE
<Pyroh> No
<Dman> MOOOOOOOOON BANISHMEEEEEEENT
<Pyroh> Its been 2 motnhs
<Pyroh> months*
<Pyroh> And we have talked a max of maybe 30 times
<TapeDiggity> Been about two or three years for me.
<Dermathil> BANISHMENT!!! PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWNCHU
<Lunasta> Well, if you're really friends with them you'll talk.
<Rodman> That's Celestia's finisher, not Luna's.

<Pyroh> That fanfic sickens me
<Dman> teeheehee
<NewDCD> 9I ALSO THOUGHT THE SAME OF THE DAI-GUARD PILOT
<Dman> FINISH HIM
<^BonBon> Pyroh, dear, perhaps your friend is having trouble finding something to talk about, but you wont really know unless you get it right from her. Try asking why she doesn't start the conversations. You're not likely to solve this problem by guessing all by yourself.
<Dman> :P
<Locke> then probably chapter three of Eithercite chronichles. I could actually submit the first chapter now but I want to wait for chapter two to be edited
<Pyroh> Well
<Pyroh> ....
<Dman> NO! NOT YET!
<Pyroh> we do kind of struggle when talking

<Dermathil> GIGA DRILL FINISHER
<Lunasta> Try finding some common ground with her
<^BonBon> I know the feeling. You two simply dont know eachother well enough to talk fluently
<^BonBon> Like lunasta said, find some common ground
<Xiagu|Inkscape> Pyroh, do you ever see each other in person?
<Locke> Sadly their probablt won't be any battlefeild action till chapter four
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<NewDCD> 9DRAMATIC VICTORY
<Pyroh> No
<Dermathil> GIGA DRILL!!!! BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAKKU!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Xiagu|Inkscape> friendships are mostly based on shared experiences
<Pyroh> Im in Canada
<HyperMetalLugia> Will it fit you? :P
<Pyroh> Shes in America
<Dman> YWA
<GGgala> nani?!
<Rodman> I love the GIGA DRILLU BREEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKU!!!!!!!!!!

<^BonBon> Pyroh have you tried doing some activities with her?
<Pyroh> ....
<Pyroh> We cant
<^BonBon> Perhaps an online game or other activity you can have fun doing?
<Xiagu|Inkscape> No, the amount of talking you can get peaks shortly after meeting on the internet (or whatever), but decays over time
<Pyroh> Were on the computer
<Dermathil> And everybody in the team is fricking troubled by that.
<Pyroh> Oh
<Pyroh> uhhhh
<Dermathil> AND NOW, WE ARE FKING OFF

<Whompman9000> Is this a bad time?

<Beatline> ...though I need to sleep soon
<Pizzicato> Your girlfriend doesn't like you?
<Beatline> See you guys less sparsely this coming week than weeks previous, in morning/late night only if at all

<Pyroh> But gf's and friends arent the same thing
<Pyroh> You dotn kiss your friend
<Pyroh> But, i shouldnt give you guys all of my problemes to deal with
<Pizzicato> Yeah, but, I mean, I've always like, enjoyed hanging out with the chicks I've been with, like, more so than I liked hanging out with anyone else.
<Pizzicato> So, y'know.
<Paul_McColtney> OH now you tell me.
<Pyroh> So lets talk about something else shall we?
<Pizzicato> I'd be like hey man, let's go throw rocks at kids at the park and pretend it wasn't us, and then we'd go do that.
<Polarfire> Hey DCD
<GGgala> streamception?
<Whompman9000> I'm not good at this stuff...
<Pizzicato> I'm not saying you should throw rocks at kids, but, I dunno, a movie?
<Pyroh> I cant even get near people without SOMEONE making fun of me
<Whompman9000> For what reason?
<Polarfire> will you read me a story?
<Lunasta> Well sometimes you need to have a little fun made of you
<Pyroh> Numerous reasons
<Pyroh> To many to count
<Pizzicato> Like you're grammar?
<Pizzicato> Do people make of you for that.
<Pyroh> ...
<Pyroh> I dont have bad grammar!
<^BonBon> lol Pizzicato... look who's talking
<Pyroh> Do i?
<Retsamoreh> too* don't*
<Retsamoreh> I*
<^BonBon> "Like you're grammar"
<Pyroh> ...
<^BonBon> "Like you are grammar"
<Pyroh> Anyways
<Lunasta> If you feel uncomfortable then tell whoever is poking fun at you to stop or at least bring the blows up from the belt.
<Pizzicato> Yeah I was mocking you, you misused 'to'.
<Pyroh> Enough of this, im sure you'd all like to hear something other than me ramble
<Pizzicato> Yeah I would.
<Whompman9000> Get pissed at them... It works
<^BonBon> Thats terrible advice whompman
<Lunasta> Naw, my net is being sucky right now so I can't play games
<Pizzicato> So I bough this awesome camera, and I really like it, and I ran a roll of film through it, took some really great pictures, pictures I was stoked to see.
<Polarfire> I hear noises
<Pizzicato> Then I developed the roll.
<TapeDiggity> http://i.imgur.com/79oAX.png
<Pizzicato> Light leaks, man.
<TapeDiggity> I regret nothing.
<Pizzicato> God damned light leaks.
<^BonBon> 1. thats what they want and 2. It will only get you a bad reputation
<Pyroh> Oh wow
<Pyroh> Stupid chat -_-
<Pyroh> Keeps lagging
<Pizzicato> Like, half of my pictures are RUINED.
<Whompman9000> Alright I'm guessing I'm not good with this stuff
<Pyroh> It dont matter
<Pizzicato> The two best shots survived, so I'm happy about that.
<Pyroh> Im done anyways
<Flamerunner|TF2> My chair
<Flamerunner|TF2> it moved
<Lunasta> Go to the store and go Cave Johnson on them :P

<Retsamoreh> Do you do any other works? Have a dA?
<Pyroh> BonBon
<Pyroh> I agve up 2 years ago
<Pyroh> gave*
<TapeDiggity> Yeah, I've got a dA, but I'm really bad at keeping it updated.
<Pyroh> Its a bit late for that :3
<Pizzicato> Why does everyone ask do you have DA? Why can't you have a website? A portolio, a wordpress?
<TapeDiggity> Just tapediggity.deviantart.com
<Lunasta> Don't worry Pyroh. This community is based on love and tolerance after all.
<TapeDiggity> I do appreciate the support, though; means a lot to me.
<TapeDiggity> LOVE AND TOLERANCE, BRAH
<^BonBon> Yeah, if nothing we'll still love you Pyroh ;)
<Retsamoreh> You should work your way over to #EquestrianStudy, we love artists over there.

<Pyroh> I go to bed at 4ish
<Glacymr> 12dwakeeeeee

<Foraging_on_Lunasta> You wanna hear screwy sleep patterns?
<Pizzicato> People say 'Man, you're self employed, you get to make your own hours!', nooooooo, no I don't, my clients get to make my hours.

<Pizzicato> Potato crisps.

<Polarfire> not really what I expected based on the trailers
<Pyroh> Why are you listing foods
<Pyroh> Is it your grocery list :3
<Pizzicato> No, those are things I can make
<GGgala> SPOILER: humans lose
<Pizzicato> 'cause I have potatoes.

<Pyroh> Paul
<MrPoniator> You've got some patience, BitZero
<Pyroh> Norberts already gone
<Paul_McColtney> Or we build an exact copy of Earth right over there!
<Mongoose|MK9> If luna can wait that long
<Mongoose|MK9> we all can
<Paul_McColtney> We have one minute people!
<BitZero> I've got billions of years worth of time, MrPoniator. It's only a small blip.

*Arcanine pulls NightSeas
<Mongoose> It works well online

<Mongoose> just not offline
<MrPoniator> Yeah, bots are a bit harder to practise parrying with
<MrPoniator> Unless you can just record the actions, dunno how MK9 training mode works
<Mongoose> I never use training
<MrPoniator> Ah, ok
<Mongoose> I just fight in till I get better
<MrPoniator> I'm either in training mode or playing versus against a buddy in offline, so yeah
<Mongoose> I played versus all day
<Mongoose> but I play plenty of online matches
<MrPoniator> ok
<Mongoose> I kick flank with Johnny Cage
<Light_Latias> 12this puzzle is muy dificil
<MrPoniator> Welp, I didn't get into MK9 anyway, so ah well
<MrPoniator> I'll just stick to mah BlazBlue
<MrPoniator> And try to get better in Guilty Gear while I'm at it
<mook> i'm still playing kof2k2 and sfz3
<Mongoose> MK is the only fighting game I play
<Mongoose> I tried MVC3
<Mongoose> but went back to MK
<MrPoniator> Well, Alpha 3 is cool and so is kof2003
<MrPoniator> Looking forward to KoFXIII
*Arcanine puzzles it up
<Mongoose> Cage has some amazing combos
<drf|away> 03GRR
<MrPoniator> I'd kill if I could do some high level combos that you never get to use in real matches
<MrPoniator> In BB, that is
<Mongoose> I have never played BB
<Prison> Bronies! How goes it?
<MrPoniator> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIdMA8tVYlY&feature=related Totally would kill if I knew this combo
<MrPoniator> Just likelyhood of actually using that... -5%
<Mongoose> I'm not really into fighting games like that
<Mongoose> I like the speed and style of MK
<MrPoniator> Yeah, BB/GG are a bit more floaty and speedy when compared to MK9
<Mongoose> yeah
<mook> need to get my coworkers play umk3 on mame again...

<Glacymr> 12i know the video game
<Glacymr> 12i just don't know how to competitively do it
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12i actually find it easier to be a competitive player when you can see all the cards on the table
<Glacymr> 12in battles you have no idea what your opponent has until they bring it out

<Pizzicato> Suck on that shit.
<MrPoniator> I'm stuck with 4GB
*Octavia sighs at ponibooru.
<MrPoniator> But yeah, that's quite a powerhouse there
<Lunasta> 4GB here too
<Pizzicato> I cap out at 8 which suuuuuuuuuuucks 'cause I use digital audio workstations a lot.
<spidersean3> Mhm

<NightSeas> 12but yeah, you can feel free fre to battle me xD
<MrPoniator> Ah
<NightSeas> 12I'm quite bad at it :D

<MrPoniator> I know how expensive the film editing stuff can be, so ah well
<NightSeas> 12Hey there NS
<spidersean3> So there's something to be said about that lol
<Octavia> momento, slow internet at my home.
<Pizzicato> Oh, yeah, you can drop a shitload of money on recording gear.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Roses are red, violets are blue, you write beautiful music, and that's why i love you.
*MrPoniator goes to Hollywood
<Pizzicato> I'd like to have about four Neumann U87's, they run 3.2k a pop.
<Octavia> my new compressor was ridiculous :(
<Glacymr> 12hi
<MrPoniator> "Hey, can I touch that Camera?"
*MrPoniator breaks it
<BlacklightShining> …wow!
<BlacklightShining> I can't believe nopony grabbed these nicks!
<MrPoniator> Whoops, thousands of dollars wasted!
<BlacklightShining> LOL
<Octavia> Pizzicato, very good song!
<Pizzicato> Thanks.
<Dragoran> o-o
<spidersean3> Nicks?
<Pizzicato> Good band.
<Ascendant> lol hi
<BlacklightShining> Nicks.
<Pizzicato> Like, anyone can put a mic in front of those guys and make them sound good.
<spidersean3> Nicks everywhere
<Dragoran> Altair fuck you
<Glacymr> 12Ascendant is made of tacos
<Pizzicato> That was recorded in a rehearsal studio.
<NightSeas> 12Yep
<Pizzicato> If you're an audio geek I can give you the full rundown of the mikes I used.
<Lunasta> spidersean3 Overclock it!
<MrPoniator> :U

<Tenaris> howdy, say any pony here have microphone experience to when it comes to recording?
<Lunasta> I meant the CPU
<Octavia> i find a lot of music that i enjoy in the indie area sound far better when they work off piece and parts equipment
*MrPoniator remembers when he felt like he was the shit when he overclocked his old Win95 computer
<Pizzicato> Piece and parts equipment?
<Octavia> garage equipment :)
<Lunasta> I have it easy lol
<Pizzicato> You make that sound in the mix.
<Octavia> my best amplifier ever was an old peavey tube amp with every single dial and switch broken
<Flamerunner|TF2> I can't hold it anymore
*Flamerunner|TF2 glomps Octavia
*Octavia eeps!
<Pizzicato> Record them well, then you can make them sound like trash in the mix, or you can make them sound like they were recorded with shite.

<Ascendant> hi
<Light_Latias> 12wbs
<Pizzicato> I'm listening to this track again, and yep, I freakin' nailed the mix. I am not even going to be modest, this sounds good, damn good.
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 12Luxray.
<BlacklightShining> ^ [MrPoniator's message]
<Lunasta> You gotta know in this era
<NightSeas> 12Yay
<Tenaris> Well im using a desktop microphone by the iessentials brand,its not that bad but pretty light and not use an usb port. so i have to use recorder to get it connected to audacity and other uses. Im new to recordning myself and not sure what a good what level the microphone should be
<Paul_McColtney> The Wall is a Spy!
<Lunasta> If we didn't, it'd be all Skynet in here
<Pizzicato> That's such a cocky thing to say, but this sounds good. Good band, good engineer.
<MrPoniator> Derpynet, more likely
*Paul_McColtney Stares suspiciously at wall
<Pizzicato> Tenaris: I record at -18.
<Lunasta> Not that I hate bots or anything
<Lunasta> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Lunasta> yes
<Octavia> it does sound great
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Lunasta
<MrPoniator> Don't feed the Derpynet!
<Pizzicato> That gives me headroom to mix, and I push my mix to -6, then push the master to -.1.
<SilverSonic> o..o
*Octavia tickles Flamerunner|TF2, "You are sure an effection one"
<Lunasta> I wanna see if my 555 can unlock into a quad core
<Pizzicato> Don't record at 0, then you won't be able to mix without peaking.
<Tenaris> Pizzicato: Microphone or microphone boost?
<drfsupercenter> 03Light_Latias

<Lunasta> but my mobo was $37 on sale and it doesn't do unlockings

<spidersean3> Lunasta, I'm sure if most of us didn't know computer specs, skynet would eat us all
<Flamerunner|TF2> i'm expecting my brother to give me his laptop that's 20% better than mine
<Tenaris> Pizzicato: thanks
<spidersean3> Thanks, Derpy.
<Octavia> 20% cooler, also?
<Flamerunner|TF2> Also...
<Pizzicato> Octavia: I'm a bassist, stand up bass.
<Pizzicato> Ya all with your...your...electronic instruments.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Meh
<Flamerunner|TF2> it's kinda plaid.
<Octavia> oh, i play viola also, darling
<Lunasta> Ooh PMVs
<Pizzicato> I've been wanting to pick up violin.
<Flamerunner|TF2> mine at least has a cool Q on the middle
<Pizzicato> I've written a bunch of songs for jazz violin, and I can record bass, use Ivory for keys, but I can't get any good violin recordings by myself.
<stripes> *dances to the music*
<spidersean3> Jesus christ its been forever since I got on steam
*Lunasta punts then shoots his internet
<Lunasta> VERIZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Glacymr> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Glacymr, you are a 12Pidgeotto.
<Glacymr> 12uh oh
<Octavia> i would prefer my old yamaha ivory baby grand but i lack space for one
<Pizzicato> I need to pick up piano, too. I'm looking to take orchestration classes, and in some of the classes, you're given a sheet of music to be played by a full orchestra, and are told to arrange it for piano.
<Pizzicato> Like, on the spot.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Does make a bonesaw sound like a violin counts as instrument?
<Pizzicato> Octavia: What was it?
*Flamerunner|TF2 grabs a bonesaw from his bag
<Pizzicato> I've recorded a C7.
<Pizzicato> Which was really awesome.
*Flamerunner|TF2 holds it like a violin and somehow starts playing The Godfather theme
<Pizzicato> I prefer Bösendorfers, but when you're presented with a C7, you're not going to complain.
<Polarfire> poor stripes
<Polarfire> everyone leaves before you can talk to them
<Pizzicato> I really need to pick up piano, like, it's a necessity.
<Octavia> i had a g2 that was partially burned in a house fire. i restored and restrung it completely
<Octavia> i have a friend which repairs instruments, she helped me
<Pizzicato> I want to record orchestras, and if you're recording orchestras, you need to be able to read music better than you can your native language.
<Octavia> haha
<stripes> ...*sniff armpits*....mmmmmm, im not mTHAT bad :)
<Pizzicato> I'm going back to school for theory.
<Pizzicato> I'm pretty serious about recording orchestras.
<NightSeas> 12Pidgeotto <3
<Pizzicato> That's what I'm going to do, and that's pretty much it.
<Octavia> you make me want to listen to pizzicato 5
<Pizzicato> Oh yeah, my name.
<Pizzicato> I play pizz.
<Pizzicato> So, you know.
<Glacymr> 12don't leash me D:
<Pizzicato> I can't play arco very well.
<Pizzicato> That sounds like a lot work you put into your piano, sucks to lose it.
<Ascendant> ok
<drfsupercenter> 03hi Ascendant :/
<Pizzicato> I've put a lot of work into an instrument before, it's so satisfying, and people got to see mine.
<Pizzicato> I'm not sure you got to roll around your piano to venues.
<Polarfire> ha.
*ClockworkPie continues to lurk
<stripes> so as a few are heading to sleep, im guessing that there are mostlu u.s. ponies here?
<NightSeas> 12http://25singlewhitefemale.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/cat_birthday_cake.jpg
<Octavia> i used to play in venoit park in tampa
<Pizzicato> I had an Engelhard EC1, I sanded it, primed it, painted it white, lacquered, and put a pretty boss pick up in it.
<NightSeas> 12Floof~
<Pizzicato> Thing was shiny as all get up.
<Polarfire> yeah.
<Polarfire> probably most are I would guess.
<stripes> nise well i is downunder :)
<stripes> *nice
<Pizzicato> What genres or styles of music do you play?
<Polarfire> What time is it there?
<stripes> 510pm
<NightSeas> 12oh no, look what NS started at the c-box XD
<Polarfire> 2 am here
<drfsupercenter> 03*s-box
<NightSeas> 12drf-box*
<stripes> ahh, thats why there isnt much happening
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Polarfire> eeyup.
<Octavia> strangely enough, since i am in the land of completely void culture, ive been playing a lot of country songs. not the twang kind.
<NightSeas> 12NO U ---->
<Jazza> Does hay make you itchy?
<Polarfire> its about 8 am for the europeans.
<drfsupercenter> 03why the arrow
<Pizzicato> On violin or piano?
<Polarfire> so pretty much a dead hour for everyone but the aussies :P
<NightSeas> 12Because you
*NightSeas runs
<Octavia> piano, i am a very big rascal flats fan
<Pizzicato> Know the name, not the band.
<NightSeas> 12How are things drf?
<drfsupercenter> 03fine
<Octavia> for practice, i play quite a bit of aplocalytica-type on the viola
<Glacymr> 12i might as well challenge cup NightSeas D:
<Pizzicato> Violas are weird, I'm very used to violin, for some reason I know like, six? violinists, I see them a lot, I played with in a piano trio a lot, too.
<Glacymr> 12what's the server Ascendant?
<Pizzicato> So when I see a viola, I'm like wtf did that violin eat a bunch of ice cream or something?
*Octavia giggles
<NightSeas> 12Yay :D
<Octavia> i love its depth, the notes seem to resonate nicely in my ears
<NightSeas> 1291.121.255.156:5080
<stripes> so is there many ausies here
<spidersean3> jesus christ
<Pizzicato> Yeah, I always think that violists and violinists hear something really different than what the listener is hearing.
<spidersean3> how horrifyinng
<Lunasta> That seems mean Pizzi
<Lunasta> Calling a viola fat
<Polarfire> EEEEeeeenope.
<Octavia> it is fat
<Pizzicato> They are! Look at them!
*Octavia smiles
<Pizzicato> They look weird.
<Pizzicato> They're weird!
<Pizzicato> I like 'em, for sure, but they're like, the odd man out in the string family.
<Lunasta> I think they prefer crafted larger :P
<Octavia> viola is the violins fat friend you take to a club to look better by comparison
<Pizzicato> Haha.
<Polarfire> some pop in from time to time but there's not that many from what I've seen.
<stripes> hehe, oh, well, im happy to help fix that :P
<Polarfire> lol
<Octavia> strangely enough, my brother in law is a violist also
<Pizzicato> That is kind of strange.
*Octavia rubs her eyes, yawning.
*BlacklightShining is bored
<Lunasta> Go jump of a cloud Blacklight
<Lunasta> that should cure your boredom
<Octavia> im currently helping my partner in reading sheet music and playing banjo, trying to get him through the agonizing cat whining phase.
<BlacklightShining> fine, I will!
<Pizzicato> Haha.
<Pizzicato> Some people play without knowing theory!
<Pizzicato> That seems so weird to me.
*BlacklightShining jumps off of the cloud he was lying on
<Octavia> thats very true
*BlacklightShining falls
<Pizzicato> I can't fathom not knowing theory.
<BlacklightShining> wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!
<Octavia> my step father was very by-ear guitar player
*BlacklightShining pulls out of the dive at the last second
*BlacklightShining alights on another cloud
<Pizzicato> There are a lot of talented dudes out there who don't know theory, for sure, but they're the exception.
*Octavia applauds for BlacklightShining
<Sir_lagalot> hey guys!
*BlacklightShining beams
<BlacklightShining> thank you, thank you, I'm here all night
<stripes> so, how long has this channel been here
<Pizzicato> Man, I see a lot of musicians, and I'd say only about a third of people in rock know how to read sheet music.
<Sir_lagalot> it's 3:32 am here, and im still not asleep yet!
<Pizzicato> Yeah, same here.
<BlacklightShining> IMPOSSIBLE
<Pizzicato> Only I'm 14 minutes in the past.
*Octavia is just a simple girl, does not play for flash. she has a great day just sitting on her patio and playing for the birds.
<BlacklightShining> it's 0:19 here!
<Sir_lagalot> say that to the guy who drank 7 cup of tea
<BlacklightShining> so it must be either 3:19 or 2:19
<BlacklightShining> so it must be either 3:19 or 4:19 *
<Pizzicato> I'm a bassist, bassist don't ...we just, we don't, y'know, man we're in our own world.
<Polarfire> well the movie nights started around mid may, and the chat has been here since then.
<Sir_lagalot> youre a musician?
<Pizzicato> I have a blank stare when I'm playing bass, just staring at a spot on stage, I find a plank of the flooring, and stare at it.
<Pizzicato> Yeah I play stand up bass.
<stripes> wow, nice,
<Pizzicato> We've been talking about music for like the past half hour.
<Sir_lagalot> Ohh neat!
<Polarfire> They've switched hosts a couple times also.
<Sir_lagalot> I like music as well, just that I dont play any instrument
<Octavia> i have had a couple times where i have hijacked an empty piano at a mall or hotel and just played till either the manager kicks me out or i made enoguh tips to drink the rest of the night :)
<Sir_lagalot> exept for triangles
<Polarfire> But this particular room has been here since I've been here, about the first week of june.
<Pizzicato> Haha, man! Have you been to a piano bar?
<Pizzicato> Two pianos across from each other, people go on stage and have piano battles.
<Lunasta> Off to game I shall, so be a dear and be a pal!
<Octavia> yeah, used to go to one in tampa bay
<Sir_lagalot> oh this sort of piano bar?
<Pizzicato> Those are so cool!
<Polarfire> #bronystate, I mean
<Pizzicato> I went to one in Detroit, I wish my pianist had been there.
<stripes> great, so its almost as new as i am to mlp ..hehe
<Sir_lagalot> its remind me of the movie Who framed roger rabbit where donald and daffy are having a piano battle
<Octavia> my favorite was venoit park. almost every night there was a quartet or a choir or something there. then they would do shakespear on the grass
<Pizzicato> She's really good, what's that competition for amateur pianists called?
<Polarfire> ah.
*Octavia sighs deeply, missing her home.
<Pizzicato> The big one, I can't remember the name of it, but it's for 35 and older amateur pianists.
<Flamerunner|TF2> g2g
<Flamerunner|TF2> Bye
<BlacklightShining> cya Flamerunner|TF2
<Pizzicato> She's going to be entering that competition in the future.
<Flamerunner|TF2> and Octavia... I LOVE YOU, there i said it
<Octavia> 35 and older? one more year for me.
*Octavia groans thinking about that.
*Octavia quirks an eye at Flamerunner|TF2
<Polarfire> well I think I'm going to go.
<Pizzicato> Ha.
<Pizzicato> 35, old?
<Polarfire> nice meeting you stripes
<Pizzicato> I'm afraid not.
<Octavia> im 34
<stripes> i has only discovered this new series about end june/early july and have fallen in love with it
<Pizzicato> That's not old.
<stripes> um..ok Polarfire
<Octavia> i feel it sometimes
<Pizzicato> Old is 60+, and that's only if you're not taking care of yourself.
<stripes> nice chatting with you too..
<Octavia> especially in here. haha
<BlacklightShining> [off-topic] are there any non-malicious uses of ping -f ?
<stripes> goodnight sweat pony dreams!
<Sir_lagalot> ping f?
<Octavia> -f does what?
<mook> -f - do not frag packets
<Octavia> oh, fragment flag?
<BlacklightShining> -f Flood ping. Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one
<BlacklightShining> hundred times per second, whichever is more. For every
<BlacklightShining> ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for every
<BlacklightShining> ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This provides a
<BlacklightShining> rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. Only the
<BlacklightShining> super-user may use this option. This can be very hard on a net-
<BlacklightShining> work and should be used with caution.
<Octavia> oh, not what i thought.
<Pizzicato> I've been writing a fic that's very music related, it involves Octavia, and a jazz piano trio, so I can write for that sort of thing really easily.
<Polarfire> yep sounds like a lot of others.
<Pizzicato> I posted the intro; http://www.forums.rainbowdash.com/index.php?topic=140.0
<Pizzicato> I think you need to be a musician to know what I'm on about.
<BlacklightShining> seems to me the only use for it is DDoS'ing a site
<ClockworkPie> shush ponies are sleeping
<Pizzicato> In the fic, that is.
<Octavia> ill read it definitely
<Polarfire> oh you
<stripes> great..i is not alone :)
<BlacklightShining> run that from a bunch of different computers…
<ClockworkPie> :D
<Polarfire> so have you been to a movie night yet stripes?
<midnightshadow> as always, you can use certain techniques and programs for testing a network
<Pizzicato> You'd probably be able to guess why I named the violinist Four Fifths, too.
<mook> i have icmp off
<stripes> um..no..i need an explination of that ..hehe
<mook> iirc
<stripes> hello ClockworkPie
<Cracky> it provides an non-malicious use in it's won description :p
<midnightshadow> if you've got a dodgy network and you want something to flood the network with to see what's happening, flood ping is simple and effective
<ClockworkPie> aw hello stripes
<stripes> HOWS YOU?
<ClockworkPie> quite good actually, you?
<stripes> ooops..sorry about the capsloc
<stripes> not bad thankies
<ClockworkPie> so ya never been to one of the movie nights yet O.o

<Umbreon> 12their pokemon won't come out
<Dragoran> o_O
<stripes> gotcha
<Dragoran> I'll look into it
<Dragoran> brb dinner
<Umbreon> 12and the game will just sit there as the timer goes down
<Glacymr> 12it's down
<NightSeas> 12Oh
<NightSeas> 12We'll just try again some other day xD
<Lunasta> Blech

<Glacymr> 12i guess
<ClockworkPie> well i think it might be time for this pony to hit the hay
<NightSeas> 12Looks like it's getting past my bed time
<NightSeas> 12Good night :3
<stripes> well nice to meet you
<stripes> sweat dreams
<ClockworkPie> thanks, and who knows, we might see each other around again :D

<abirkin2> Tenaris: I cannot Abide Chrono Cross... storywise.
<abirkin2> sheisse
<stripes> i hope to drop in again yes..
<Pattyrick> herro people
<abirkin2> Chrono Cross would have been so much better if it were unconnected to Chrono Trigger. Hell, Chrono Trigger would have been better with a proper, direct, sequel.
<ClockworkPie> well if you are ever bored and need someone to talk to, ill probably be here lurking
<ClockworkPie> night stripes
<stripes> ill remember that :)
<Tenaris> goodness connection being silly
*Glacymr gives Pattyrick pancakes
<abirkin2> Tenaris: I cannot Abide Chrono Cross... storywise.
<abirkin2> Chrono Cross would have been so much better if it were unconnected to Chrono Trigger. Hell, Chrono Trigger would have been better with a proper, direct, sequel.
<Tenaris> technicly
<Tenaris> its considered a parraell universe to trigger like radical dreamers
<abirkin2> possible
<abirkin2> y
<abirkin2> buuut, that doesn't mean it was an optimal game
<Tenaris> so it pretty much not really a sequeal but is one
<Tenaris> chrono trigger 2 is still in the waits, seriously one day square will stop focusing on fantasy and give it a thought
*Pattyrick noms
<Pattyrick> I wish Glacymr could make me some real pancakes for breakfast D=
<Glacymr> 12sorry i'm a bad cook
<Glacymr> 12:<
<Pattyrick> Not as bad as I am
<Pattyrick> I can cook Hot Pockets well, but not much else :|
<Tenaris> But honestly at first i hated trigger and got on the bash wagon the same way i did with dreamers, and after playing it im okay with it. good characters music and story. Just still want that next gen trigger remake xD;
<Barry> Hiya
<Glacymr> 12:/
<Glacymr> 12did you ever even try anything else?
<abirkin2> I hope we get another proper Castlevania, after that fiasco that was Lords of Shadow
<Pattyrick> Mom taught me how to bake Ghirrardelli (or however the heck you spell it) brownies 2 summers ago
<MrPoniator> Do you want a Castlevania, or Metroidvania?
<Pattyrick> uhhh
<abirkin2> either, really, just not God of War
<Pattyrick> I can sorta make this awesome Velveeta cheese dip
<Pattyrick> but my mom is much better at it
<abirkin2> hell, Castlevania 64 was better than lords of shadow
<MrPoniator> I'd prefer a normal one, seeing I don't like the metroidvania aspect in SotN, DoS, etc
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12i am always afraid to cook meat
<abirkin2> (and was a much better game than people give it credit for)
<MrPoniator> Metroids are fine, but in games like SotN the exploration feels quite bland
<Pattyrick> It's not the easiest thing to cook exactly to your taste
<Pattyrick> rare, medium rare, medium well, well, there are so many ways to have it cooked
<stripes> hello barry
<MrPoniator> Just gimme a game like Rondo of Blood and we're talking
<Barry> How are you?
<stripes> great and you?
<abirkin2> DIE MONSTER! YOU DON'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD!
<Barry> doing good
<Barry> Say, what time is it where you live, Stripes?
<MrPoniator> And tenaris, I don't necessarily see the need for a continuation to Chrono Trigger
<stripes> atm 6.16 pm
<BlacklightShining> :O
<BlacklightShining> LOOK WHAT YOU DID, abirkin2!
<Barry> It's 4:16 PM here
<Barry> AM*
<MrPoniator> It's like begging a perhaps needless chapter to already finished story
<Barry> sorry about that
<abirkin2> BEWARE MY SORCEROUS POWERS!
<stripes> hehe, you is up early or very late to hit the hay
<Barry> up early
<Barry> I hit the hay at 9 PM
<MrPoniator> But yeah, if SE ever needs a quick buck
<Dashite> I'm the opposite. :)
<MrPoniator> Make a HD remake of FF7 and infinite easy money
<Barry> which would be 11 AM for you, I'm guessing
<MrPoniator> Still pretty darn surprised that they're not doing just that
<Dashite> By the opposite, I mean that I'm up late as opposed to early.
<stripes> hehe yupyup
<stripes> hello dashite
<Barry> Hi Dashite
<Dashite> Or you could have been talking to stripes. Damn you lack of body language context!
<Dashite> Hey.
<abirkin2> FFVI was better
<Barry> I was chatting to stripes, but that's nice to know, Dashite
<stripes> hehe
<MrPoniator> I know, but FF7 still gets the title that really broke the ice between westerns and JRPGs
<mook> my fave was tactics
<BlacklightShining> abirkin2: you're scaring everypony away…
<BlacklightShining> :(
<MrPoniator> I like Tactics and FFIX
<Salad_Sandwich> dr34mca5t
<Salad_Sandwich> g'morning everypony
<MrPoniator> yo
<Westy543> HI!
<Mongoose> That was one damn tasty sandwich
<Dashite> At what point would you say night stops being night and becomes morning?
<Mongoose> and filling
<Jazza> I don't think it could beat my Mi Goreng noodles I had earlier
<Salad_Sandwich> ...have you been raiding my pantry> >>
<Salad_Sandwich> **pantry?
<Mongoose> Maybe not
<Jazza> The Sonic The Hedgehog songs are quite catchy and good
<Jazza> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvux5Bdizao
<Mongoose> I have never been a Sonic fan
<Mongoose> RE Imo has the best music
<MrPoniator> Not much of a Sonic fan either
<Barry> 12 AM, to be technical
<Salad_Sandwich> I am a massive Sonic fan
<abirkin2> Resident Evil, Mongoose?
<Mongoose> yep
<Jazza> I'm not a Sonic fan either, but the soundtrack is pretty good
<Barry> Otherwise, dawn
<abirkin2> which games and tracks?
<MrPoniator> Daisuke Ishiwatari, JDK Band and Motoi Sakuraba ftw
<Jazza> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH_MCPcjxP0
<Mongoose> Mostly the first three
<Mongoose> the save room themes are the best
<Salad_Sandwich> MrPoniator just named two of my favourite composers
<Mongoose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53aDI5K49F4
<Dashite> Hmm...
<Mongoose> Fallout, Mass Effect, RE and MGS had the best music
<abirkin2> you know we're finally getting ports of 4 to 360 and PS3 supposedly?
<Mongoose> imo
<Jazza> I want to know the name of this song... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi54WXIoDas
<stripes> when you wake up?
<Mongoose> yep
<Mongoose> 4
<Mongoose> and Code Veronica
<Mongoose> I hoped for 2
<Salad_Sandwich> Escape From The City
<Mongoose> but oh well
<Salad_Sandwich> @ vi
<Dashite> I like that answer. :D
<Salad_Sandwich> **vid
<Barry> What if you go to bed at 7 AM, and wake up at 7 PM?
<Salad_Sandwich> It's from Sonic Adventure 2's City Escape level
<MrPoniator> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiDguHfPCDU&feature=related
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Guilty Gear X2 OST-&quot;Meet Again&quot;
*Salad_Sandwich could tell that in literally 2 seconds
<Barry> does that make 7 AM night and 7 PM morning?
<abirkin2> Mongoose: you know what I want ported to XBLA?
<Mongoose> what?
<Jazza> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi54WXIoDas
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Rainbow Dash propels forward for fifteen minutes while I play fitting music
<abirkin2> Resident Evil: Outbreak

<stripes> yupyup
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<Mongoose> hell yeah
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Resident Evil 2 - Office Theme
<stripes> sounds great to me
<Mongoose> I have the first
<Mongoose> I was sad when the multiplayer was shutdown
<junh1024-XD> Pattyrick, do you mean, Glacymr posts you some pancakes in the mail ?
<MrPoniator> Furril, dat image
<Dashite> That depends, do you eat breakfast when you get up a 7pm or do you eat dinner?
<Pattyrick> Hmmm
<Pattyrick> That'd be an idea
<Pattyrick> :B
<Glacymr> 12i make super big pancakes
<Barry> *shrugs*
<Barry> but that was just a hypothetical scenario
<Furry> 4:30pm... 30 mins to go
<Pattyrick> make sure to put chocolate chips in it, and send me some Mrs. Butterworth's syrup
<abirkin2> all employees proceed to the bottom platform
<stripes> hehe
<Salad_Sandwich> It's 9:30am here
<Barry> I usually get up at 7-8 am
<MrPoniator> 11:27 AM
<Furry> Please
<Furry> Do not post your own time
<Barry> or whenever I'm no longer tired
<Mongoose> God damn
<Furry> It ALWAYS happens whenever someone mentions their current time
<MrPoniator> lol
<Dashite> >_>
<Salad_Sandwich> Hurr
<Salad_Sandwich> I have an appointment to keep in an hour and a half
*Dashite got up at 13:30
<Mongoose> Well Let's see it's 6:00 pm so that means thirty more minutes in till the movie
<Mongoose> 4:50 Pm
<Mongoose> 3:10 Am

<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Ys I&amp;II Chronicles - To Make The End of Battle
<Mongoose> 6:66 PM
<Mongoose> %3555:332 am
<Furry> 523434534:32434234234234 pm
<Dashite> I can't do that. If I need to be up that early, it's easier for me to just stay up. :/
<abirkin2> I couldn't beat Ys II
<Mongoose> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl5xbFXrFU4
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<Salad_Sandwich> Nine nine nine, nine nine nine, nine nine nine...
<stripes> lol
<Dashite> 30 minutes from that right now. Just starting to get tired.

<Mongoose> :(
<abirkin2> I played the original YsIII MRP
<Mongoose> :)*
<MrPoniator> Coolio
<MrPoniator> And yeah, I guess remake is fine and dandy

<Mongoose> Join #Mongoosetown
<abirkin2> Mongoose: I wanna see Billy Coen again
*Pinkamena_Diane_Pie makes his first submission to EqD

<RePod> never
<abirkin2> did you know, that the main compose for morrowind, oblivion, and presumably skyrim did the soundtrack to Secret of Evermore?
<Tenaris> well yeah its probally at the level where it needs to uypgrade the memory space
<MrPoniator> MOAR BANDWIDTH
<killerrabbit> I don't think bandwidth is the problem :P
<Tenaris> th worst case scenario is they wipe all the data clean
<killerrabbit> why in the world would they wipe the server?
<Tenaris> Pony Overload!
<killerrabbit> would be better to just ftp it all over to a new server
<killerrabbit> once their paid time runs out at least
<MrPoniator> To a new server that doesn't screw up the OS
<Salad_Sandwich> Mmm
<killerrabbit> well, slightly *before* their paid time runs out -.-
<Tenaris> another cost money the mods wouldnt have
<MrPoniator> DONATIONS
<killerrabbit> MrPoniator: screw up the OS? what?
<BlacklightShining> *cartoon lightbulb*
<BlacklightShining> GOOGLE!
<BlacklightShining> why didn't I think of it before?
<Salad_Sandwich> Too obvious?
<killerrabbit> what? going to mirror ponibooru? lol
<MrPoniator> "According to our webhosts, the instability since July 27th was due to a "bumpy" operating system upgrade on the host servers. "
<BlacklightShining> lol no
<BlacklightShining> just google site:ponibooru.413chan.net and change it to images
<BlacklightShining> Google caches everything, so…
<Barry> @pony Jason
<MrPoniator> heh
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Jason is 5Little Strong7heart
<killerrabbit> ah
<Salad_Sandwich> I'm pretty sure Google doesn't use conventional servers any more; rather, they're using miniature black holes to store everything.
<killerrabbit> wonder what they did to mess up the OS, the hosting company that is
<MrPoniator> They heard deleting win32 (while it's probably not a Win OS) was a good idea
*Salad_Sandwich snickers
<BlacklightShining> impossible!
<killerrabbit> no, it is a windows server
<BlacklightShining> how do they retrieve the data?
<MrPoniator> Ah
<killerrabbit> is has port 135 open, which is the port for msrpc
<MrPoniator> Thought they'd use Linux or somethin'
<abirkin2> ware wa messiah nari! hahahahaha!
<killerrabbit> it has*
<MrPoniator> abirkin2, too much Mega Man Zero 3?
<killerrabbit> and that port is almost never used on linux, although I guess it could be...

<killerrabbit> Creation date: 24 Jan 2011 20:34:00
<killerrabbit> is when the domain equestriadaily.com was registered
<killerrabbit> so... I'd imagine sometime very close to then
<FallSilently> Less than a year? Cool.
<Mongoose> I want to punch this douchebag in the face
<Mongoose> so badly
<killerrabbit> FiM isn't a year old, and this site was built around G4
<Ray> 02bbl
<abirkin2> the times, they are a changin
<Ray> 02back in the night... I think xD
<stripes> *sulks*..oh nose what if it gets to nothing..
<Tenaris> Friendship has changed
<Tenaris> Big boss~
<stripes> omg ponyville disapears
<Tenaris> xD;
<BlacklightShining> wait
<BlacklightShining> FiM ≠ G4 ?
<abirkin2> FOR THE EMPEROR!
<BlacklightShining> ??
<killerrabbit> FiM == G4
<BlacklightShining> ^ what I thought
<killerrabbit> who said otherwise? o.O
<BlacklightShining> [killerrabbit's last message]
<FallSilently> Wait, EqD was started for a different generation?
<BlacklightShining> …??
<killerrabbit> derp
<killerrabbit> killerrabbit> FiM isn't a year old, and this site was built around G4
<killerrabbit> quoting myself ftw?
<FallSilently> yay
<Tenaris> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/35705?search=snake
<FallSilently> Blacklight don't confuse me
<Barry> it won't
<BlacklightShining> …
<BlacklightShining> I'M the confused one here
<Tenaris> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/20411?search=Big_Boss
<FallSilently> I thought FiM was more than a year old, though. Cool to know that, too.
<killerrabbit> first episode of FiM was 10/10/10
<killerrabbit> lol@that date
<FallSilently> Easy to remember
<killerrabbit> this is true
<FallSilently> Presumably Season 2 will be around the same date this year, then.
<killerrabbit> hopefully soon :D
<Tenaris> What are yall expectaions for season 2? . .Aside from the Luna fanon being the canon xD;
<killerrabbit> ponies!
<killerrabbit> (i really don't have any -.-)
<FallSilently> I don't think I have any, either. And I'd rather not have any, so they don't get dashed.
<killerrabbit> I just hope it is as good as S1, even if it is a little worse, that would still be good enough for me :D
<FallSilently> I imagine there'll be more nods to the fanon from the background ponies.
<FallSilently> But that can't be anything that the little girls could notice and not understand.
<killerrabbit> I just hope they don't overdo those
<killerrabbit> S1 had the right amount imo
<FallSilently> Some of Derpy's fan shoutouts bother me for being too obvious.
<FallSilently> Like when she paused in front of the camera when Dash & Fluttershy arrived for the Young Fliers, or her front-row seat at Fluttershy's fashion show.
<killerrabbit> you think they overdid the derpy eyes?
<killerrabbit> yeah, those were kind of in your face
<Tenaris> Im hoping they start a seasonal trend, you guys remeber how dash at the gala psuhed that gray pony caesar into the air and catch him to imopresse the wonderbolt right?
<FallSilently> No, just made her presence too obvious.
<FallSilently> Yes....
<Tenaris> Im hope they make it some sort of running gag where she does stuff like that to him
<killerrabbit> I want another winter episode too -.-
<Tenaris> yknow like everytime he is around her he will get abus--hurt xD;
<FallSilently> That'd be cool....
<Tenaris> though with his lack of popularity i doubt it happening
<Tenaris> however with fanon hur hur hur
<Guest> is it frowned upon to submit things you've made to Equestria Daily?
<FallSilently> I don't believe so...
<FallSilently> What did you make?
<killerrabbit> nope
<killerrabbit> submit away!
*FallSilently must stop ending his sentences with elipses
<Ascendant> blah
<Cloudey> 06heya Ascendant
<Ascendant> Hi
<Guest> alright then, i just made some video and was wondering if it was wrong or bad for me to try to submit it :O
<abirkin2> WE MUST HUNT FOR HERETICS, AND PURGE THEM WITH FIRE! IN THE NAME OF THE EMPEROR!
<killerrabbit> not at all
<FallSilently> Nah, I think most people submit their own stuff; the three bloggers could never scour every part of the internet every day for new stuff.
<killerrabbit> but, you should link it here too, so we can see it early :D
<EpicStatsGuy> Persona, Fursona...what do you call a dragon then?
<Ascendant> wb Drake :p
<Ascendant> inb4 ping
<Shaico> Heck I linked my video as well to them.
<Lyon> 04hi
<Ascendant> epic fail
<Ascendant> I'd congratulate you but there's not much to congratulate
<Drake> 04Obviously
*Drake returns to the life-killing TVTropes/
*Ascendant hugs Drake
<Tenaris> nothing wrong with trying to submit things to the daily
<Ascendant> Can you get on PO for me please?
<Ascendant> Need to test stuff
*Drake hugs back
<Drake> 04Sure
<Tenaris> i've tried to submit two things to the daily and never got the reply odds are they got rejected xD;
<Ascendant> Apparently there's issues with challenge cup
<killerrabbit> aww, no early link
<Guest> oops, accidentally backspaced
<Tenaris> not going to stop me from trying the next time xD;
<killerrabbit> Guest: people do that a lot -.-
<Shaico> I submitted one thing only, and it got accepted :D
<Guest> eh, it's just some minecraft video, wouldn't be very interesting to anyone here :P
<killerrabbit> I need to submit my fanfic still
<Guest> i'll try to submit it though
<FallSilently> I haven't submitted anything, and I've never been rejected - yay perfect record!
*FallSilently brohoofs Shaico
<killerrabbit> you can't have a perfect record if you don't have a record :P
<Shaico> Whoopee
<Furril> <gingerale> Hmm.. Has anyone shipped Twilight with Vinyl Scratch before?
<FallSilently> Undoubtably.
<killerrabbit> probably
<Shaico> Aw dammit
<Shaico> I got hiccups.
<Tenaris> nice Shaico what did you post?
<killerrabbit> you would be hard pressed to find a new shipping combination, unles you are going for the obscure background ponies
<FallSilently> ...nope, can't think of any way to tie that into Pinkie's pranks.
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07said by Lightumbreon: you losing from Articuno isn't a defect in the program Ascendant
<Ascendant> What?
<gingerale> Furril!
<gingerale> Hi!
<Ascendant> I beat Articuno
<Tenaris> Is there a proper way to submit art to seth or something?
<Shaico> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLSkYoYNAG8
<Shaico> That
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07Lightumbreon: *flees*
<Furril> Im watching you...
<Furril> 0.0
<Tenaris> Don't think i broke any rules and winter wrap up =D
<FallSilently> There's a link at the top of the main blog page, "Submit" or something
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07Lightumbreon: i'm on teamviewer, pattyrick forgot to turn it off
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07now testing some new scripts
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07like: !bike
*Cloudey saw Cone stealing his bike 04"ASH STOLE MY BIKE!"
<Tenaris> yeah i clicked it, followed what said about rules, but is there a pasic thing i needed to do
<Ascendant> Pattyrick lol
<junh1024-XD> !biks
<junh1024-XD> !bike
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07no, Cloudey/Lightumbreon :3
*Cloudey saw Glacymr stealing his bike 04"ASH STOLE MY BIKE!"
<junh1024-XD> !base
*Pattyrick|altWTF owns: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO Chimera
*Cloudey owns: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US
*Ascendant wat
<FallSilently> pasic?
<Tenaris> it wasnt -Don't send OC ponies-No porn-No gore.
<junh1024-XD> do you mean, what you say??
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07pattyrick and i share 2 scripts :3c
<Tenaris> Not to sound like complaining just curious on how to submit the art
<Tenaris> the right way when emailing him
<TTG> hm
<FallSilently> Maybe upload it to deviantart and send him the link?
<TTG> How now, citizens?
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Ascendant> Remove one then :p
<FallSilently> Hellew Overlord
<Tenaris> did that, sent him original file pic and dev link, i said i wanted to submit this to the art section. Was i suppose to be more specific about it?
<Tenaris> and howdy
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07Lighty: why would i? i meant to share some scripts with peaople, like sharing a !cmds script with GL
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Hello!
<junh1024-XD> !cmds
<Tenaris> Hmm whats your thougths on blue berry muffins overlord?
<Tenaris> =o
<FallSilently> I don't know, it sounds like you did everything I'd have done.
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5sVLYQMfe8
<The> whaat
<Tenaris> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/42699
<abirkin2> why does the bunny have a goatee?
<Tenaris> dont you get it, the goatee represents how evil it is
<TheArtistPreviouslyKnownAsTTG> Angel Goatee XD
<Tenaris> =0
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07!Cloudey
*Cloudey now belongs to Pattyrick|altWTF for 5 minutes
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07good :3
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07((lighty still testing >.>))
<abirkin2> Temaris: the goatee just doesn't work, methinks
<abirkin2> not on a buny
<abirkin2> er bunny
<TTG_again> lol, I can just see Shadowbolt 'Shy
<FallSilently> Maybe if you had it circle the whole mouth, like proper Evil Spock.
<Ascendant> Glacymr
<Ascendant> I don't see any issues
<Cloudey> 06!varset4
<Ascendant> lol
<Cloudey> 06!varset 4
<Cloudey> 06oh wait
<Cloudey> 3[Variables clouded4]
<Cloudey> 06xD
<Ascendant> <Pattyrick|altWTF> Lighty: why would i? i meant to share some scripts with peaople, like sharing a !cmds script with GL
<Ascendant> it gets annoying
<Ascendant> If it's notice I can tolerate it
<Cloudey> 06not if not abused
<Ascendant> But not if it's a channel message
<TTG_again> I can just picture her having this really creepy subtle cruelty, like Toht from Raiders
<Cloudey> 06it's a notice msg
<Ascendant> It'll flood the channel, and note there's something called "redundancy"
<Ascendant> The !base one wasn't :p
<TTG_again> "Let me show you, fraulein, what I am used to dealing with..."
<Ascendant> Also, i suggest using if ($strip($1) == !base) { in your script as well
<Cloudey> 06and the effect is?
<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07Super effective!
<Cloudey> 06oh, and pattyrick is back on hids own PC now :P
<Ascendant> Removes colour codes and lessens the chance of the script being accidentally activated
<Ascendant> on *:TEXT:*!base*:#: { if ($strip($1) == !base) { msg $chan blah blah blah blah } }
<Ascendant> or well
<Ascendant> describe $chan

<Pattyrick|altWTF> 07let me fix that
<FallSilently> How many fingers am I holding up?
<killerrabbit> 0, silly, ponies don't have fingers
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> just /quit
<FallSilently> Shush!
<Tenaris> abirkin2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7tfWURD5tI Goatee = instant evilization
<Ascendant> Anyway
<Cloudey> 06someone do "!base" please
<Cloudey> 06oh wat
<Cube> !base
*Pattyrick|altWTF owns: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO ScriptBot
*Cloudey owns: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US
<Ascendant> That's getting annoying
<Tenaris> But yeah the goatee thing making that evil i think it was from south park or looney tunes some cartoon
<Tenaris> that signified it
<Cloudey> 06let me take care of that then :P
<Ascendant> :p
<abirkin2> ugh, I hate the SFIV char designs
<Ascendant> If you're also going to test your scripts
<Ascendant> do it in another channel
<abirkin2> why did they need to make Ryu a steroidal nightmare?
<Ascendant> say, #scripting or even #ircgames
<Cloudey> 0610-4
<Ascendant> Or another channel, so you can register that channel and use /bs say #channel !script
<FallSilently> South Park was referencing Spock.
*FallSilently really needs to play some Street Fighter now... too bad he has no XBox.
<Cloudey> 06i did
<Ascendant> k
<Tenaris> goodness connection still being silly, well i have to go ill catch yall later
<FallSilently> See yah
<FallSilently> er
<DesertRose> the awkwardness of saying good by after they have already left....
<FallSilently> Bye Shaico.
<MrPoniator> akirbin2, don't forget Chun-Lis thighs
<MrPoniator> At this rate she'll be a Legzilla
<FallSilently> Who could....
<FallSilently> I main Balrog myself, and his head seems to get smaller with every update.
<MrPoniator> That too
<MrPoniator> Also I still like to think that Dee Jay got hit by a frying pan at birth, seeing how flat his head is in earlier games
<FallSilently> It is a bit flat.
<abirkin2> but, on the topic of ryu, I mean, he started out well built, but mostly human, with a decent face... I don't know who this SFIV guy is, but it isn't Ryu
<FallSilently> I like the SFIV graphical style. Chunky and cartoony.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, Capcom went apehorseapples with the muscles in SFIV
<FallSilently> Makes Mortal Kombat characters look like wimps.
<MrPoniator> Well, I'll rather take my (mostly skinny) anime characters in BB
<Jon> Aaaaand there it is.
<FallSilently> Hellew
<F-Frost> Yoo
<Jon> First thing I see is something about skinny anime characters out of context, EQ chat at 3 am...good times.
<MrPoniator> Heck, if a small kid like Carl can kill of Tager with unblockable resets, it's no laughing matter http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5m4mqtiHQ4
<stripes> hehe
<DesertRose> hi
<MrPoniator> Yo
<F-Frost> Yoo
<FallSilently> Heh
<FallSilently> I don't play BB much but I know Tager has trouble in a number of matchups.
<Barry> Hi Rainbrodash
<Jon> HA! I loved that video because Carl and Tager are my two characters!
<MrPoniator> Haha
<stripes> hello RainBroDash
<Barry> And what's funny, Stripes?
<MrPoniator> And Tager really has trouble in all match-ups
<MrPoniator> As long as the character doesn't try to use frame traps
<Jon> Tager cause I love the meaty tanks and Carl cause I love a challange and it's such an awesome concept for a fighting game.
<stripes> the clip
<MrPoniator> I play Bang, recently picked Ragna and try to learn setups for Carl while at it
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Cognitive Dissonance (Upate Part 6!) (http://tinyurl.com/6etjcrm)
<Jon> I don't play online or competatively but there are 4 people who play at my house, so we keep each other sharp.
<MrPoniator> Coolio
<FallSilently> That's not a nightly roundup, Seth....
<MrPoniator> I don't really have a whole lot of people around my area to play with, so I go to fighting game meetups and all
<MrPoniator> Next weekend to Umeå
<killerrabbit> nightly wrapup, nightly wrapup! cause tomorrow day is here!
<Jon> Nobody in the gaming club at school plays...damnedest thing.
<FallSilently> Same here. I've been to a few Street Fighter tournaments but they generally whup me badly.
<F-Frost> Wow, Ume... Thats almost close to me -.-
<MrPoniator> :U
<FallSilently> And my XBLive connection, when I had one, was pretty laggy so I rarely played online.
<Jon> The amount of time necessary to get good enough at any game to be competative at a tourney is far beyond the point of fun for me.
<Balloons> Can't agree more.
<MrPoniator> Well, it can still stay fun, depending on if the other players follow your skill level
<FallSilently> I still had fun.
<Jon> I was getting really good at MK9, then I found Deadly Premonition and remembered what fun was.
<FallSilently> I knew I'd be beaten.
<MrPoniator> But yeah, fighting games are kinda niche seeing how much you need to put time into them to be good and all
<Jon> I'm not saying it can't be fun for people to play that much and get that good, I just know it's not for me.
<FallSilently> I still put plenty of hours into the offline modes so I knew the game, it was just PvP stuff I fell down on.
<MrPoniator> So I'm not surprised when people prefer it the casual way
<MrPoniator> Yeah, bots are rather random or more or less predictable
<FallSilently> There are people who go out of their way to learn the finest points of every matchup, exact hitbox and damage stats... that's above my limit.
<MrPoniator> But with players you need to be more vary of your tactics
<MrPoniator> I don't look into framedata charts (while I do understand 'em)
<Jon> Non-sequitor, anypony ever played an ole horror/adventure game called "I have no Mouth and I must scream"?
<johnsey> I did! awesome time
<MrPoniator> I've heard of it
<johnsey> wrong channel
<johnsey> but hi :)
*johnsey is back
<FallSilently> Every new update for SFIV gets pored over in minute detail, and while I can follow the arguments, I don't get upset by a single-frame startup speed change.
<FallSilently> Heard the name, know nothing about it.
<MrPoniator> Or hey! Ibuki's U1 has one less frame start-up on reversal!
<Jon> Cool, just downloaded, looks fun. SFIV was odd for me, I could beat it on Very Hard and win about half my matches online in about a week after no more than 10 hours of total play, but never got any better.
<FallSilently> Exactly.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, SFIV was kinda the same kind of deal to me
<MrPoniator> Or Street Fighters in general
<MrPoniator> BlazBlue though compelled me to get better
<Jon> There's just something so standardized and not-special about it.
<Jon> Blazblue and MK9 were the only fighting games over the last 3 years that have really grabbed me.
<MrPoniator> Well, SF is one of those definining serieses
<MrPoniator> -in*
<JackiePie> Hi
<MrPoniator> Hey-o
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Jon> Well, IV specifically, like they made the characters all not-special anymore. I didn't feel like I was playing a russian super man or a Bruce Lee clone, just different sprites with moves that were either slow and powerful or quick and light.
<MrPoniator> Also while I do understand the differences between different shoto characters, I prefer variety, even if it results in a smaller roster
<MrPoniator> Like BB, none of the characters are alike in multitude of ways
<Jon> BB has a decent roster, especially since there's so much difference but still good balance, in CS anyway. CT was just laughably unbalanced, but just a good starting point.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, Carl's clap loop and Rachel were out of this world
<MrPoniator> Among other things
<Shaico> I want Mane6 to come out already.
<MrPoniator> CS2 balanced the things pretty nicely
<MrPoniator> But now there's CS2+, which supposedly changes the balance again
<Jon> And Nu was too powerful and Arakune's curse was on or off, and good luck getting a shot it when it's on.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, that was quite something
<killerrabbit> er, what is CS2? it definitely is not what I think it is -.-
<Jon> The one on PSP?
<MrPoniator> CS1 = BBCS ver. 1.00
<MrPoniator> 1.01 adds Makoto
<MrPoniator> 1.02 adds Valkenhayn
<MrPoniator> 1.03 changes the game to use CS2 balancing, and adds Platinum the Trinity
<MrPoniator> And now, CS2+, which will be 1.04 I suppose, will add Relius Clover
<MrPoniator> Though, CS2+ is only confirmed for PS Vita from what I know
<MrPoniator> So may be a while before that patch hits consoles
<MrPoniator> For example with the balance changes, Bang is S-tier in CS1, but middle/low in CS2
<MrPoniator> So yeah, it changes quite a lot, from combos to tiers, etc
<MrPoniator> MK9 has been doing balancing and patches all the time since launch, but ArcSys just releases this kind of stuff in bigger patches
<FallSilently> Hay Octavia
<MrPoniator> And I guess that's enough of me being nerdy about BB
<Octavia> Hey
<FallSilently> I was following you, I just don't play BB so I couldn't add anything.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I can figure
<MrPoniator> And well, supposedly there's a loketest coming up soon for CS2+, so I guess more details will surface then if it changes a whole lot
<FallSilently> You seem to be having trouble tuning the cello there.
<MrPoniator> That's rather distressing
<Unidentified21609> First time here
<FallSilently> Ah. The Octavia name is registered to someone so it's not going to stick.
<Unidentified21609> Fgiures, even though I was the first.
<Unidentified21609> Damn posers.
<MrPoniator> Well, someone just beat you to it
<Unidentified21609> Probably someone using it in a different name meaning
<Unidentified21609> Its an actual name of cvourse.
<FallSilently> The registered Octavia's a regular. She'll probably be in later, this is a bit early for her I think.
<MrPoniator> Welp, there was the guy/gal who registered Octavia here last night
<Unidentified21609> Well, I'm (arguably for some) one of the people who came up with that name for her.
<MrPoniator> Well, in that case that quite stinks
<FallSilently> Ah, the perils of creating something so popular.....
<Unidentified21609> Mhmm.
<Unidentified21609> I'm the "Octavia" in the comments on the blog too.
<MrPoniator> You've registered there?
<FallSilently> Ooh I love your avatar.
<Unidentified21609> Mhm.
<Unidentified21609> lol Thanks.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I just post as anonymous
<FallSilently> I'm "Fall" in the blog but that was also registered here, so I had to make up a surname for myself.
<Unidentified21609> I posted as "Derpy Hooves" for a while too.
<stripes> well im off ive had fun meeting you all, goodnight everypony
<FallSilently> Which reminds me, must change avatar....
<MrPoniator> Well, I doubt anyone will take this name anyway, so ah well
<Barry> cya
<Unidentified21609> But a friend I have who works on the show said I more resemble "Octavia" since I'm a musican and DJ irl, so they said I should stick with her. They know Derpy and Octy are my favs.
<MrPoniator> Heh, alrighty
<Unidentified21609> Though personally I think I'm also quite derpy like Derpy irl. lol
<FallSilently> You could add a flourish of some sort to your name. We've got like three Rainbow Dashes.
<Unidentified21609> I have plenty of derp moments.
<Unidentified21609> lol Yeah.
<Unidentified21609> Theres so many combinations of popular names in one place at any given time.
<Unidentified21609> One place I used to frequent had like 4-5 RD's and Pinkie's sometimes.
<Shaico> I find that watching kyrospawns' videos and reading the comments a fun past time.
<Shaico> I mean
<Shaico> I lol'd when I saw this vid's top comment
<Shaico> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kYPpX4340&NR=1
<Unidentified21609> Lmao
<FallSilently> I never read YouTube comments. It's not worth the rage.
<MrPoniator> YouTube comments can be like that
<Unidentified21609> No, this is Patrick!
<Shaico> And this
<Shaico> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuNK74CPcA&NR=1
<MrPoniator> I usually just check the top rated ones
<Unidentified21609> I'm not a Pinkamena Diane Pie! *pouts*

<FallSilently> I played as TJ Combo in that game. I tend to gravitate towards boxers in games....
*Ray yawns
<Mongoose> heheheh
<Mongoose> yes
<MrPoniator> Never got to play Killer Instinct that much
<FallSilently> It was broken as hell at the higher levels. Infinite unblockable combos.
<MrPoniator> <3
<Unidentified21609> Whelp, I'm going back to my projects. Have fun all you crazy ponies.
<FallSilently> We shall see.
<FallSilently> I could trot out my crackpot theory that the ponies are not, in fact, ponies, but are, in fact, cats.
<Nuclear> Hey all!
<MrPoniator> Or more horribly, humans
<FallSilently> But just look at them. They are definitely cats.
<FallSilently> Smooth curves, short snouts, pointed ears.... cats.
<RandomlyWeir> .
<RandomlyWeir> Cats...
<RandomlyWeir> Are you pinkamena diane pie?
<FallSilently> Cupcakes only ruins one character. I plan to ruin them all, simultaneously, for everyone.
<RandomlyWeir> lol
<RandomlyWeir> Only one?
<RandomlyWeir> two
<RandomlyWeir> Appolblewm
<RandomlyWeir> is also consequenced
<FallSilently> Never actually read it (for that reason). I assumed only Pinkie gets ruined.
<Ray> 02dead chat is deaaaad
<RandomlyWeir> what?
<MrPoniator> Even the background ponies?
<RandomlyWeir> Read it
<RandomlyWeir> Cupcakes is good
<MrPoniator> <_>
*MrPoniator points at Prince Charming
<Ascendant> lol
<Balloons> No, it is a disgrace to the fandom.
<RandomlyWeir> ORLY?
<FallSilently> I like the Pinkie in the cartoon. I don't need to see a crazed equicidal maniac everytime I switch an episode on.
<RandomlyWeir> i don't think about it as a disgrace
<FallSilently> What about the background ponies?
<RandomlyWeir> Fallsilently,
<MrPoniator> But there are better stuff to read
<RandomlyWeir> Yes you do
<RandomlyWeir> You need to have pinkeh's image ruined
<FallSilently> crazed Felicidal* maniac
<RandomlyWeir> 3/4 of bronies cannot look at pinkie without imagining...
<RandomlyWeir> Cup

<FallSilently> That's broniism.

<MrPoniator> 47.3s of 1m40s done
<MrPoniator> Though, now comes the most painful part
<Balloons> Excuse my ignorance but what are you animating?
<MrPoniator> Ponified version of an opening
<Ascendant> heya Xeli
<MrPoniator> But I'm too lazy as buck even though it's not that hard technically to do
<Espeon> 06~
<Balloons> I see, opening to?
<MrPoniator> You'll see
<Balloons> Oh, didn't know it was a secret ;)
<MrPoniator> Yeah, for whatever reason I'll keep it that way till it's done
<Balloons> Well i hope things go well for the next minute of animating :)
<MrPoniator> I'll try to finish it before thursday, but gotta see
<MrPoniator> Since I'll be away between thursday-sunday, so yeah
<Balloons> Will be looking forwad to seeing it :D
<Balloons> forward*
<MrPoniator> Alrighty :p
<MrPoniator> My first proper animation since I quit animating in Flash three years back, so oh god how cranky it all feels
<Balloons> oh, no rush. if you think that's what i meant. I was just saying i am excited to see how it will play out :)
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I getcha
<Cloudey> 06back

<Beatline> Mornin' everypony.
<Beatline> Hooray for days that my alarms actually work.

<Shaico> Engrish
<MrPoniator> And god
<MrPoniator> I do hope YouTube likes me for change when I upload this animation there
<MrPoniator> Since I'll try to export it in semi-HD at least, so yeah
<Balloons> I assume this is your first ponified thing? ;)
<MrPoniator> I made BlazBrony a week back
<Barry> welcome back, Sirsprinkles
<MrPoniator> That character select thingie
<anndead> So, I advertised my forum on here the other day and I got a great new member to join up, I was wondering if anypony would like to join http://mylittleponyfanclub.com ?
<Balloons> ah, i see. i made the assumption that it was the first pony thing you uploaded to youtube hence you mentioning change. my bad
<Jazza> Where all of cartoonlion's art removed from Ponibooru?
<MrPoniator> Well, I have one silly video there, and then some prior experience to that
<MrPoniator> Since I used to upload stuff under another name, but I pretty much left that account to rot
<cuteturret233> hi
<MrPoniator> yo
<cuteturret233> are u ok
<SirSprinkles> 6My comp restarted... =/
<cuteturret233> today

<Beatline> *Oh
<cuteturret233> :)
<cuteturret233> so do u like fluttershy
<Barry> ah
<cuteturret233> ?
<Barry> I hate it when that happens
<Balloons> I don't know a pony who doesn't like Fluttershy ;)
<Beatline> "Like"? Sure
<Beatline> Not my favorite though
<cuteturret233> my sis hates her i dont nkow why
<Balloons> Did she say why?
<cuteturret233> no
<SirSprinkles> 6It's because of HP updates that I need to install. =/

*Jazza 's tummy is full
<Espeon> 06o.o

<Balloons> Fruit bar, bowl of rice, oatmeal. my diet is so odd.
<Salad_Sandwich> It probably would indeed be a salad sandwich
<Salad_Sandwich> Those are my speciality after all ^_^
*Ray is bored .-.

<Salad_Sandwich> I didn't do it on purpose!
<Salad_Sandwich> ...ooh.
<FallSilently> How could you!
<Salad_Sandwich> I just suddenly had an amazing idea
<Salad_Sandwich> It would be awesome if someone would make, like, places from Equestria and ponies for Comic Chat
<Espeon> 06How goes? :3
<eXAKR> !check http://www.hubworld.com/my-little-pony/shows/friendship-is-magic
<ScriptBot> It's just you. http://www.hubworld.com is up.

<Soital> 12I'm good thanks, yourself? :3
<FallSilently> New dresses for the what, now?
<Salad_Sandwich> ...yeah ,not many people are familiar with it.
*Beatline is not one of those people
<Salad_Sandwich> It's a really old IRC client Microsoft made.
<Salad_Sandwich> Basically it worked like any old IRC client, except that it gave everyone avatars in a comic panel
<Salad_Sandwich> And everything people said was put in speech bubbles, and it would attempt to infer mood from what was said.
<Salad_Sandwich> I think I have an example from a chat somewhere, hold on
<FallSilently> http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/ISee.jpg
<Beatline> ^
<Salad_Sandwich> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/MFComicChat.png It's there, but forewarning it has some naughty words D:
<Beatline> That made me lol.
<FallSilently> Indeed.
<Salad_Sandwich> But yeah
<Salad_Sandwich> If someone made ponies for it, and some Equestria backgrounds, there's high lolz potential
<Salad_Sandwich> =o

<Espeon> 06but that doesn't count

<Salad_Sandwich> The dough was still good! T_T

<Beatline> Get it
<FallSilently> No.

<FallSilently> GLaDOS is a spud now?
<Salad_Sandwich> She got spud'd in Portal 2.
<FallSilently> Ah. Say no more.
<Beatline> ^
<Espeon> 06and he doesn't even really have the need for it, it's just available so why not
<Espeon> 06oh well
<Nuclear> god damnit opera!
<FallSilently> Seriously, I haven't played that yet.
<Salad_Sandwich> Minor plot spoiler there
<Beatline> Do it.
<Rainbow> Boooo spoilers
<Beatline> It's an awesome game.
<Salad_Sandwich> What did it do? @ Opera
<Rainbow> don't tell him about how the glados died for second time
<Salad_Sandwich> I use that myself
<Beatline> 12. Pens. Apples.
*Espeon rolls
<Ascendant> XD
<Nuclear> It freezes on me!
<Rainbow> Potatoes
<FallSilently> Need to reacquire my XBox first. It's 400 kilometres away.
<Salad_Sandwich> D:
<Ascendant> my school's internet is slower than Altair's connection ):
<Salad_Sandwich> Who was hungry?
<Rainbow> Where do you hail from?
<Ascendant> then again Altair's connection is insane
*Salad_Sandwich starts building sandwiches
<Ascendant> 30mbps
<FallSilently> Me? Ireland.
<Salad_Sandwich> Scotland for myself
*Nuclear starts dying on the inside from the wasted clock cycles.......
<FallSilently> Woulda said "miles" but I can only think in metric and I'm not sure if there are 400 miles in Ireland.
*Salad_Sandwich distributes delicious sandwiches
<Salad_Sandwich> There probably are if you went around the perimeter
<Espeon> 06Just to be sure, the same mbps as speedtest returns or what? :P
<Espeon> 06and hi Xanbreons
<Salad_Sandwich> And perhaps not even then, I mean Great Britian is like roughly 1200 miles from end to end.
<Ray||Testing> 02well. this is just plain weird .-.
<Salad_Sandwich> **Great Britain
<FallSilently> This sandwich has no chocolate chip in it.
<Salad_Sandwich> Why would you want chocolate chips in your salad? D:
<Beatline> Coleslaw and marshmallow sandwich, yay
<FallSilently> BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET ONE IN MY COOKIE
<Nuclear> Mmmmm
<Salad_Sandwich> If chocolate chips in your bread is your thing, you can have a brioche.
<Nuclear> Marshmallows....Rarity.....
*Beatline has notoriously strange taste in sandwiches, but hey, they're good.
<Salad_Sandwich> Fold your wings, Nuclear -.-
<FallSilently> French Pain au Chocolat, now that's where the delicious is.
<Beatline> Rarity =/= marshmallow. [/discussion]
<Nuclear> Heh
<Salad_Sandwich> Chocolate brioche is essentially the same thing, to my knowledge.
<Ray||Testing> 02LOL, I'll have to re-download Tf2
<FallSilently> First had one in Paris, in the Louvre cafe. I also remember seeing the Mona Lisa on that visit.
<Ray||Testing> 02such a nice time to have decent internet connection.
<Salad_Sandwich> Nice
<FallSilently> But I remember the pain au chocolat more
<Salad_Sandwich> I've never been to Paris myself
<Salad_Sandwich> Though have travelled a reasonable amount
<Salad_Sandwich> Furthest afield I've ever been is Pennsylvania.
<FallSilently> I haven't. I've been to Paris, Rome and two Polish cities.
<FallSilently> And a couple of holiday resorts with the family, but nothing major. Oh and Barcelona.
<Salad_Sandwich> I've been to Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Sweden, Switzerland, and very briefly Ohio, Germany and France. Or at least I think I passed through Germany.
<Salad_Sandwich> BARCELOOOONA
<Salad_Sandwich> SUCH A BEAUTILFUL HORIZON
<Salad_Sandwich> *etc*
<FallSilently> Don't know where he found a horizon, it's all buildings.
<FallSilently> Every directions.
<Salad_Sandwich> ...please tell me I'm not the only one who remembers that song >>
<FallSilently> Especially when you're inside an opera house.
<Salad_Sandwich> And yes, that's very true
<eXAKR> Can't find any Nightmare Moon lineart :(
<Salad_Sandwich> Sad timnes @ eXAKR
<Salad_Sandwich> **times, even
<Salad_Sandwich> I may need to replace this keyboard soon
<Salad_Sandwich> I hope I get this job I'm being interviewed for on Frday
<Salad_Sandwich> Then I could afford to.
<Espeon> 06Ascendant
<Espeon> 06http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=7270.0 this topic screams for your valid input

<FallSilently> I need to put on some music. Freddie ****ing Mercury is singing the same bloody word in my head over and over, thank you very much.
<Ascendant> ....lol
<Ascendant> XD
*Salad_Sandwich giggles wickedly
<Nuclear> .....
<Beatline> That's why I prefer non-lyrical music
<eXAKR> Salad_Sandwich: Good luck
<Salad_Sandwich> Thanks! ^^
<eXAKR> and buy a Logitech
<eXAKR> They last
<Nuclear> Well
<eXAKR> I have one here
<Espeon> 06oh god it's one of those topics I'll add to again and again and again and edit my post and and
<Espeon> 06asdf
<Salad_Sandwich> It's a Logitech I have
<Espeon> 06I must restrain myself
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> I'll reply
<Salad_Sandwich> I've had it a good five years roughly
<Ascendant> as soon as my fingers start working agin
<Ascendant> again
<eXAKR> Oh
<Salad_Sandwich> It's taken a good deal of abuse.
<eXAKR> I see
<Salad_Sandwich> I know I've spilled my drink on it at least thrice throughout its life.
<lightIRC_1182> hello
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Beatline> I need a new power unit...
<Espeon> 06LOl
<Salad_Sandwich> But yeah I have the MX5500 Revolution set.
<Espeon> 06lol*
<eXAKR> oO;
<Salad_Sandwich> The mouse is an absolute joy to use <3
<Salad_Sandwich> At least it is for me, I imagine if I was left-handed I would hate it.
<Salad_Sandwich> Really I just need a new keyboard. Preferably one aimed more towards gaming, I'd like that.
<Dman> Anybrony home?
<Beatline> ^
<Salad_Sandwich> This one, while great, isn't really geared for it. I'd love one that's backlit and all.
<Ray||Testing> 02this Internet connection is insane .-.
<Ray||Testing> 021gb/9.8gb
<Barry> Hi Dman
<Barry> Hi Rodman
<Dman> Heya, Barry
<Salad_Sandwich> Also some day I'd love to get one of those really high end joysticks that have a separate throttle lever and stuff
<Espeon> 06I can't complain about my connection so ~
<Salad_Sandwich> Even if its primary use would be playing After Burner II via MAME XD
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOd2pq4jVSs
<Salad_Sandwich> But yeah. My MX5500 has suffered at least three spillages throughout its life, and it looks a tad beaten up.
<Dman> *click*
<Salad_Sandwich> But it still works.
<eXAKR> I'm saving up for a pair of high-end speakers
<eXAKR> Bowers & Wilkins MM1
<eXAKR> Super expensive
<Salad_Sandwich> Only a pair? Not like a 5.1 or 7.1 system?
<eXAKR> I hate anything above 2.0
<Ray> 02well...
<Dman> cool vid
<Ray> 02meaaaanwhileee
<eXAKR> I have a rather tiny room
<Espeon> 06FLOOF
<Salad_Sandwich> Ahh
<Salad_Sandwich> I have a reasonably sized room
<Salad_Sandwich> Plus my soundcard does a good job of upmixing everything into 5.1
<Nuclear> Souncard!
<Dman> Lunch tiemz :P brb
<Dman> i'll finish vid when i come back
<Nuclear> Creative Labs Professional Titanium X-Fi Fatal1ty series?
<Salad_Sandwich> Yah. I actually have a separate one rather than using onboard, because I care about how stuff sounds. XD
<Nuclear> Me too!
<Salad_Sandwich> Not an X-Fi, no
<Salad_Sandwich> It is a Creative one
<prince-dari> Ok, set that up to start up automatically when I connect to this server.
<Salad_Sandwich> It's a slightly older Audigy
<Nuclear> They tell me all the time that a soundcard is not necessary, but only when you actually care about how things sound lol.
<prince-dari> Because it stops every time I DC.
<Barry> Hi Dari
<Dman> hurray
<Dman> also hi
<Dman> also, i'm off to lunch brb
<prince-dari> Hey.
<prince-dari> Bye.
<prince-dari> XD
<Dman> XD
<Nuclear> Yeah I have a sigmatel from creative labs in this old Dell XPS M1330....
<Salad_Sandwich> And yeah, after the first time I had a SoundBlaster there's no way I'd go without a dedicated soundcard nowadays.
<Salad_Sandwich> Hi DR!
<DesertRose> ello
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpjdd2Ga2u0
<FallSilently> Hellew
<Salad_Sandwich> But yeah. It's a Audigy SE IIRC. nothing special, but way way better than the onboard sound on this machine.
<Nuclear> Yeah good to knowo
<Nuclear> I cannot wait to get my own desktop and install a soundcard
<Ascendant> Posted, Xeli
<Nuclear> I want to record audio in 32-Bit/256KHz Linear Pulse Coded Modulation!
<Salad_Sandwich> oh boy XD
<Ascendant> Xeli
<Ascendant> I think I quoted some things you've said
<Rodman> Hello everybrony
<Ascendant> at least 5 times
<Ascendant> ._.
<Dman> Sup Rodman
<Ascendant> "tl;dr as long as people don't try to shove their opinions down someone else's throat, I'm happy."
<Ascendant> that's from you iirc
<Rodman> So, how's everbrony doing?
<Salad_Sandwich> 24-bit is as high as mine goes
<Dman> I'm good. eating. you?
<Salad_Sandwich> I dunno what sample rate it goes up to but I know it's patently ridiculous.
<Nuclear> Yeah I figured that
<Barry> I'm good, too
<Salad_Sandwich> With that said, when i have money enough to upgrade my PC, I'll likely be getting something far more insane than what i have currently.
<Nuclear> I think it's 24-Bit samples with a 192KHz sampling frequency.
<Rodman> Just had dinner, so good in that aspect.
<Rodman> Could I have a link to the ponychan thread regarding schedule please?
<Dman> rodman, schedule is here, in 'home' i think
<Nuclear> I think it's definitely worth the price it only takes up 1 PCI-E port anyways
<Dman> above the chat
<Salad_Sandwich> I'm divided between being reasonably sane and building a hex core machine based on an AMD chip, or going mental and building a 24-core machine using two intel hex cores and hyperthreading.
<Nuclear> Thats cool, but I have to go now so i'll see you later man!
<Salad_Sandwich> Seeya~!
<Rodman> Found it, thanks
<Dman> sure bro. always happy to help

<Balloons> Ha, that would be awesome :D
<Rodman> Auto-kick?
<prince-dari> Nah, it's just that his warnings are all gone already.
<Barry> ah
<^RainbowDash> Though it'll be more of a homage, as a cheesy detective story x3
<Salad_Sandwich> Twilight's been awful quiet ever since she got here
<Salad_Sandwich> I guess she must be studying.

<Dman> 0Hitler episode next episode
<^RainbowDash> CMC will star, but the Mane Six will supplement it.

<^RainbowDash> ^
<FallSilently> ...what does that mean?
<FallSilently> That thing RainbowDash just did?
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> means she agrees
<RDash> SAKI
<Balloons> v
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> like when one says ditto
<FallSilently> Strange thing to agree with, but very well.
<Salad_Sandwich> It's like replying to someone's comment in a thread with "This".
<Salad_Sandwich> Also, I'm back.
<FallSilently> I know people use it to agree, but that just confused me.....
<^RainbowDash> Yeah.
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> mm, salad
<^RainbowDash> Lazy way to say "Me too" or "What they said"
<Salad_Sandwich> Oh my, are you coming on to me? #oo#
<Rodman> uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<^RainbowDash> no...?

<Rodman> If Pinkie Pie goes AEIOU on Season 2, heart-attack instantly

<Dman> 0DO WANT
<Dman> 0"aeiou, silly :3"
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> I don't want to Bake Apple Bloom! D:
<Dman> 0I want this in season 2!
<FallSilently> Just because your sandwich killed him doesn't mean your cutie mark failed, either.
<Rodman> HASBRO! HUB! TAKE MY MONEY ALL OF IT!
<Salad_Sandwich> Derpy derped oo
<RDash> Dman I might have seen part of the first one. Kind of rings a bell
<Dman> 0=]
<Salad_Sandwich> Well true
<Barry> Who's Minamimoto?
<Salad_Sandwich> I was just being silly there
<Dman> 0:o
<FallSilently> Maybe your special talent is lethal sandwiches.
<Salad_Sandwich> That and making reference to how the other ponies flip out when their talent fails.
<Dman> 0He is an important character in the NDS videogame 'TWEWY'
<Dman> 0or, The World Ends WIth You
<Salad_Sandwich> And noooo, I make good sandwiches =(
<Barry> never played it
<Dman> 0a squeenix game.
<Dman> 0My no.1 DS game ^_^
<Salad_Sandwich> If it was lethal sandwiches I would know =(
<eXAKR> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to eXAKR for 20 minutes
<Dman> 0The story line is insane.people die, and have 1 week to play a game, so whoever wins that game can come back 2 life
<Dman> 0but there's an entry fee
<FallSilently> And immunity to lethal sandwiches.
<Dman> 0your entry fee (you were a loner antisocial dude) is your memories
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> Salad, are you a mare of a stallion?
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> or*
<Dman> 0so you only find this out WAAAAY later
<Dman> 0but you entered, were told the rules and how to survive and win, then were lost your mind
<Salad_Sandwich> That depends, do you want to know which it is in reality or which it is in here? :3
<Dman> 0so the game actually starts with you there
<Dman> 0and erryone ignores you (acnt see the dead)
<Dman> 0ur like 'wat?' then u get attacked by monsters and stuff
<Dman> 0so after 1 week (7 levels) you win
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> hmm, based on the joke i'm about to make depending on your gender, it doesn't matter :P
<Barry> Ah
<Dman> 0then it turns out during the week you bonded to your friends, and also only 1 can pass
<Salad_Sandwich> ...-_-
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> gimme the pony one for privacy's sake then XP
<Dman> 0DEM BASTERDS let a girl you really like pass
<Dman> 0and say winners are give na chance to play again
<Dman> 0(ojnly 1 passes)
<DerpyBot> *derp*
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> !muffin
<Dman> 0DEM BASTERDS make HER your entry fee as she became most important thing
<FallSilently> !mail DerpyBot So-Glad-You-Survived-Surgery card
<Salad_Sandwich> Salad Sandwich the pony is a female =p
<Dman> 0 7 more levels go by,l AMAZIN story, and you win again
*FallSilently has no pony persona
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<DerpyBot> For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> yes
<Dman> 0they let another bro pass, and you get to reenter AND it turns out the thing that NOW is most important to you (avter story and bonding) is other players
<Dman> 0so your entry fee is other players ... you then play 7 days almost on your own.
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> then it makes sense that her special talent is making sandwiches :P /tasteless joke
<Barry> hm
<Dman> 0then there's a 22nd day where stuff. goes. down.
<Salad_Sandwich> ...
*Salad_Sandwich hoofs AppleDash in the face
<Dman> 0that's kinda your character's story in an utshell
<Barry> ah
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> hey, i'm just messing
<BigMacintosh|applebucking> thats hot
<FallSilently> And bleeding
<Dman> 0thers a lot more story, as expected from square enix, but all in all it's my fave ds game ^_^
<Dman> 0HNNNNNNNNNG
<FallSilently> Lethality theory confirmed.
<Salad_Sandwich> ...and honestly? The better joke would have been about tossing sald~ ^^
<Shaico> HEY

<Shaico> NEWFAAAG!
<Shaico> :O

<Barry> Saban should re-air the Power Rangers Movie
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> yes, rp-ing is sure fun :)
<Dman> 0make it ur b movie :3
<Salad_Sandwich> My primary sticking point with making a pony persona that matches the person is thinking up a suitable name and cutie mark. Lolz
<Salad_Sandwich> I already know more or less how it would look.
*FallSilently doesn't really get the whole RPing thing either, but whatever floats one's boat....
<Barry> I will, if I ever get a chance to select the B Movie
<Barry> If you get it before I do, will you do it, DMan?

<Z198> :P
<Parchment_Scroll> Curse these ponies, they drive me to fanfic!
<Dman> 0WOW! the intro to 'legend of the guardians' is impressive
<Z198> :P
<Salad_Sandwich> Hmm, just whipped up a pony persona with a creator
<Salad_Sandwich> Tall and lanky. Seems about right.
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaTonseQSY
<Parchment_Scroll> What creator? Need a model sheet for Parchment.
<Dman> 0w00t
<Salad_Sandwich> http://generalzoi.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FiM-Pony-Creator-Beta-210228500 That one
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSdV0ijEeno&feature=related
<Beatline> The beta creator on deviantart right?
<Dman> 0Barry - have you seen the 2004 E3 reaction to that traier? Goosebumps for like 5 minuts
<Beatline> ^
<Salad_Sandwich> It's fairly versatile
<Dman> 0wow! haven't seen trailer 2 in sooo loong thank youuu :3
<Salad_Sandwich> Anyway now I have a reference model I need a name...
<Cloudey> 06varreset4

<Cloudey> 06weir.....
<Dman> 0do I ever
<Dman> 0NewDCD wants to stream that very game
<Z198> :P
<Z198> :P
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC5dkk6sAfw&feature=related Sorry the music is so faint
<Rodman> YES!
<Barry> Sorry the music is so faint
<Salad_Sandwich> Preferably something suitably arty sounding seeing as I'm into making music and drawing, and sometimes writing.
<Rodman> From my end, NewDCD's got a supporter there
<Dman> 0Barry - "don't want you no more." That theme song. I LOVE.
<Dman> 0(the one in dat trailer)
<Dman> 0Rodman - i'll tell him if you're not around =]
<Rodman> Alrighty, thanks
<Dman> 0"Don't want you no more"
<Dman> 0so much nostalia in dat song
<Parchment_Scroll> Niiiice.
<Salad_Sandwich> Sketchy Sounds? :3
<Balloons> Derp
<Parchment_Scroll> Actually, that sounds pretty good.
<Barry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3ct4Si7sS4
<Salad_Sandwich> Awesome, now all I have to do is come up with a cutie mark lol
<Barry> The final trailer
<Parchment_Scroll> A pencil crossing a treble cleff?
<Parchment_Scroll> Er, "clef".
<Parchment_Scroll> One f.
<Dman> 0i love TP
<Salad_Sandwich> That could work.
<Dman> 0same theme there :3
<Salad_Sandwich> Or a quill pen perhaps
<Barry> TP was good, but it could have been so much better
<Sunny> 02*yawns* good morning
<Salad_Sandwich> i.e. that instead of the pencil
<Dman> 0It could have
<Barry> Let's hope they do Skyward Sword right
<Dman> 0mostly because it was a gamecube port : /
<Skylands> 10Hey Sunny
<Cloudey> 06heya Skylands
<Sunny> 02hi sky ^^
<Salad_Sandwich> Although that's really associated more with writing, and I do more music and drawing than writing.
<Cloudey> 06and hiii Sunny!
<Salad_Sandwich> Pencil it is I suppose.
<Dman> 0Miyaomto: "if SS isn't the best zelda i might stop zelda"
<Parchment_Scroll> Heh. Mine's a quill across an unrolled scroll.
*Cloudey huggles big bro Charizard Sunny
<Sunny> 02hi cloudey
<Barry> I thought it was a Wii port that was later transferred to Gamecube?
*Sunny hugs back n_n
<Dman> 0two days later miyamoto: "I believe SS is the best zelda ever"
<Barry> or do I have the roles reversed
<Dman> 0Barry no
<Rodman> I really, really, REALLY hope that gamble pays of for them
<Dman> 0Yea reversed =]
<Dman> 0Look at the textures! for a wii game
<Barry> so do I
<Salad_Sandwich> ...oh gosh this is going to be a pain to draw though
<Dman> 0teehee
<Barry> right
<Salad_Sandwich> I'm used to drawing the normal-sized mane cast
<Parchment_Scroll> Although Parchie is less /my/ ponysona than he is a proxy for any fanfic/art brony.
<Dman> 0acme out for gc about 4 months before in japan
<Dman> 0and like 2 months after elsewhere, but it's a gc game
<Salad_Sandwich> And Sketchy here is ginormous XD
*Salad_Sandwich nods
<Parchment_Scroll> Practice with Big Macintosh?
<Barry> They took what? Five, six years on the game?
<Salad_Sandwich> ...that sounds wrong XD
<Barry> SS
<Dman> 0SS
<Dman> 0hmm
<Dman> 0brb
<Salad_Sandwich> Besides, he's busy applebucking ;p
<Parchment_Scroll> :D
<Dman> 0 06 11
<Parchment_Scroll> So draw him applebucking! :D
<Dman> 0that's 5 years
<Dman> 0^_^
<Barry> If they can't make a good zelda game after that long a period of time, they should stop trying to make Zelda games
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...how do i register a nick again? :x
<Dman> 0then again, Link tot hte past took 5 years and OoT was 6 years
<Dman> 0I guess so
*Sketchy_Sounds fails IRC
<Balloons> it's in the rules ;)
<Dman> 0apparently skyward sword will have instruments like other zeldas
<Barry> Cool
<Dman> 0one point only in one trailer shows link with a Harp
<Dman> 0...:P
<Balloons> i guess he doesn't like rules :<
<Beatline> Lol.
<Dman> 0also, have you seen the backgrounds?
<Barry> a harp? Not a lyre, a harp?
<Dman> 0or lyre
<Dman> 0the Sheikah thing
<Barry> Lyre
<Beatline> ./ns REGISTER <password> <Email>
<Barry> a harp is a gigantic thing
<Dman> 0instead of fog there's a neato thing where stuff further away gets blobbier in art style
<Dman> 0it's amazing
<Beatline> Or do you want grouping?
<Dman> 0and yea barry just realised doh
<Sketchy_Sounds> Maybe grouping would be better seeing as I have Salad_Sandwich as well.
<johnsey> uh grouping sounds kinky
<Celestia> :D
<Barry> I just realized, Lyra's cutie mark is a lyre, but we've never seen her with it
<Rodman> Basically, the draw distance got combined with the art style to make something beautiful
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> wat. lol
*johnsey groups Celestia
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> well, gtg i'll cya later
<Dman> 0True dat
<Beatline> Umm..,
<Sketchy_Sounds> How do I group?
<Celestia> :O
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> Truss?
<Dman> 0wonder how Lyra got it
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> XDD
<AppleDash[VictualsNotVittles]> well bye
<Barry> I hope Season two gives Lyra some lyre time
<Parchment_Scroll> Grouping=OT3+ shipping?
<Dman> 0and Rodman / Barry seen the latest trailer?
*Shaico still doesn't get how to group.
<Shaico> Silly me.
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Rodman> For SS?
<Beatline> ./ns GROUP <Salad_Sandwich> <Password>
<Dman> 0(there's a section with a city and another with sky flying)
<Dman> 0yea
<Beatline> For your nick ofc.
<Dman> 0stuff further away is just .... pure art
<Dman> 0closer you get more detailed art becomes
<Rodman> No, let me go look for it
<Dman> 0till it's there
<Sketchy_Sounds> So that should reserve this nick for my use then?
<Parchment_Scroll> That makes Salad_Sandwich the main and adds Sketchy_Sounds to that group.
<johnsey> you just tell nickserv group nick password
<Sketchy_Sounds> Sweet
<Rodman> This one?
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zm1tLH1Oks
<Dman> 0lemme see
<Sketchy_Sounds> That's simpler than separately registering them.
<Dman> 0I think that's the one i'm on about
<Sketchy_Sounds> Right
<Zecora`> :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> I should have a shot at drawing Sketchy I guess.
<Dman> 0hmm...maybe
<Dman> 0ah yup
<Dman> 0that's the one =]
<Sketchy_Sounds> And maybe draw Salad again as I goofed on her last time
<Angel_Espeon> 13Have you ever bought a food/drink/whatever specifically for YOU to eat, only to find that someone else has had it later? D:
<Parchment_Scroll> Yeah, to separately register them, you need seperate email addresses for them.
<Barry> I can't wait for this game
*Sketchy_Sounds got as far as inking her completely, then noticed several glaring errors including a missing accessory and butt cover
<Dman> 0My most anticipated game this year
<Rodman> Flying whatchamacallit FTW!
<Cloudey> 06yes...
<Cloudey> 06i raged ;.;
<Barry> I bet it was your most anticipated game ever since you learned of it, DMan
<Angel_Espeon> 13When I went food shopping with my mum, I put a packet of fig rolls in the shopping basket specifically because I wanted to eat them sometime
<Angel_Espeon> 13just now I went to look for them
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I find an empty packet of fig rolls in the living room
<Angel_Espeon> 13;-;
<Angel_Espeon> 13WHY
<Sketchy_Sounds> Although that said part of the reason I forgot to draw her butt cover was so I could show her mark.
<Dman> 0rodman - your face when after 20 years the logo on the hyrule shield is that bird
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...I probably also should stop calling it a butt cover
<Dman> 0Barry - pretty much
<Rodman> :O
<Sketchy_Sounds> I just am not sure what the thing I have on her in AiP's pony maker is meant to be.
<Dman> 0although i..hmm... ... ... Pretty much :P
<Espeon> 06:3
<Dman> 0Rodman Lul
<Espeon> 06because
<Rodman> ARE YOU FOR SERIOUS?!?!?
<Espeon> 06<3
<Sketchy_Sounds> I /think/ it's a skirt of some sort.
<Dman> 0my face was just :O
<Barry> Spoiler, Ganon will not be in this game
<Dman> 0HAHAHA
<Angel_Espeon> 13BUT
<Angel_Espeon> 13they were for me
<Dman> 0heard that Barr
<Angel_Espeon> 13and my dad ate them all
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
*Sketchy_Sounds shrugs
<Rodman> No Ganon might be a good thing though.
*Cloudey goes to floof up a dad....
<Rodman> Evolution
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> MUFFINS
<Cloudey> 06WITH A SHOTGUN!
*Cloudey flees
<Sketchy_Sounds> Anyway
<Rodman> See what else they can come up with
<Rodman> SURPRISE US NINTENDO!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Sketchy seems to be Celestia-tier lankiness
<Dman> 0rodman this game is confirmed to be the earliest in possible timeline of sorts
<Barry> They had Vaati, Majora, what's next
<Balloons> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Balloons> yes
<Barry> Earliest so far
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Balloons
<Dman> 0so before any other game, as ninty put it, if there WERE a timeline
<Sketchy_Sounds> Which he should be because he's supposed to be tall and slim.
<Sketchy_Sounds> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Rodman> The mother of all prequels?
<Balloons> Alicorns :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> No =(
*DerpyBot walks away with a drooping tail
<Espeon> 06.-.
<Parchment_Scroll> That's pretty darn tall and slim.
<Angel_Espeon> 13also hiiiiii Espeon <3
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 5 minutes
<Espeon> 06Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
<Espeon> 06!angel_espeon
*Angel_Espeon already belongs to you, silly :3
<Espeon> 06<3
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yah well
<Barry> Indeed, Rod
<Dman> 0spose so
<Parchment_Scroll> Celestia isn't pony-proportioned. She's a My Little Winged/Horned HORSIE.
<Barry> It leads up to Ocarina of Time
<Sketchy_Sounds> Seeing as I'm basing him on my own attributes it's to be expected
*Sketchy_Sounds is 6'6" iRL and kinda skinny
<Dman> 0ah here it is
<Rodman> That just reminds me of this
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCbp5LTgbU
<BigMacintosh|applebucking> >_>
<BigMacintosh|applebucking> 3 inches more than me
<BigMacintosh|applebucking> always are...
<Dman> 0ah here it is http://i.imgur.com/tXR2Y.png
<Sketchy_Sounds> *Snerk* We talking about height here?
*Sketchy_Sounds is bricked for that
<Parchment_Scroll> Heh, I'm Big Mac's height.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> !mail Coz 7,000 crates of muffins
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hi SR
<DerpyBot> Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
<Coz> =O
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> <.<
<SummerRain> Hey Sketch ^^
*Espeon can live with being silly
<Beatline> Hello there Summer.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Silly is fun :P
<SummerRain> Hey Beatline. How's it goin'?
<Rodman> FAN THEORY MOMENT
<Barry> @1:20, Dash was here
<Dman> 0GIEF
<Sketchy_Sounds> So anyway now I have this nick grouped, it'll ask for the password for this nick too, yes?
<Dman> 0lol
<Beatline> Quite alright.
<Beatline> Though I have to head off in an hour or so.
<Beatline> SS: yup.
<SummerRain> Sketch: I Believe so..
<Sketchy_Sounds> Sweet
<Rodman> SS establishes the Kingdom of Hyrule and the monarchical rule of Zelda's family
<SummerRain> ^_^
<Sketchy_Sounds> I can swap gender on the fly lol
<SummerRain> ..
<SummerRain> XD
<johnsey> Sketchy_Sounds: yes but you can switch beteween grouped nicks without giving the pass.
<Parchment_Scroll> Heh, I should so add Parchie's pen name.
<Sunny> 02back
<Rodman> Thus, the giant birds become the symbol of Hyrule for all games of the past!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh sweet, that's very handy
<Parchment_Scroll> (Speaking of swapping genders.)
<Espeon> 06Many things are :3
<Sunny> 02I get distracted so easily xD
<Beatline> I do that constantly. xD
<Sunny> 02hi espeonS
<Salad_Sandwich> Handy
<Sunny> 02=3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol distractions
<Dman> 0and the master sword's birth, apparently
<^RainbowDash> Voila!
<Angel_Espeon> 13tell me about it
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<^RainbowDash> ...
<SummerRain> Hey RD,
*Cloudey whistles
<Dman> 0but yea Rodman that pic i put blew me away
<SummerRain> ^^
<Cloudey> 06i'ma guilty too
<^RainbowDash> There we go.
<Cloudey> 06at school + distraction = FAIL
*FallSilently is still known as FallSilently
<Angel_Espeon> 13Right now, this chat is distracting me from eating my food
<Beatline> And voila.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and it's getting cold
<Angel_Espeon> 13;w;
<Velvet_Ribbon> Et voila! here, too.
<SummerRain> soooo..
<Salad_Sandwich> I think I'll leave Sketchy as an Earth pony as opposed to making him like a pegasus or anything snazzy.
<Espeon> 06EAT YOUR FOOD
<Espeon> 06Don't be distracted from it again.
<Espeon> 06I will be here allllll day so don't worry
*Espeon hides
<SummerRain> I dunno what type of pony i will be, what my cutie mark is, or what my pony name will be according to my cutie mark when it arrives..
<Velvet_Ribbon> Earth pony artist. Nimble lips, eh? Annnnd that just went someplace cloppy without my meaning it to.
<Angel_Espeon> 13BUT IT'S COLD NOW
<Barry> that vid... wha-- huh?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't feel like eating it anymore
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<Sunny> 02microwave it
<Sunny> 02xD
*Salad_Sandwich waggles eyebrows
<Angel_Espeon> 13I already did LOL
<Sunny> 02is it breakfast?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Erm
<Angel_Espeon> 13lunch?
<Sunny> 02xDD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just got out of bed about an hour ago |D
*KershaFangs whickers
<FallSilently> You use your eyebrows?
<Dman> 0lol
<Sunny> 02me too xD
<FallSilently> Even more impressive.
<Salad_Sandwich> Hey if Octavia can play a cello or whatever it is with her hooves, no reason Sketchy can't manage similar stuff.
<Espeon> 06microwaved food is eh
*Velvet_Ribbon is Parchment's SUPER SECRET pen name for when he writes romance novels.
<FallSilently> Aye.
<SummerRain> ..
<Sunny> 02but im too lazy to pour me some cereal
<Velvet_Ribbon> SHHHH!
<Espeon> 06and HOW CAN YOU STAY IN BED THAT LONG
<Velvet_Ribbon> Don't tell anyone.
<Espeon> 06like really
<Sunny> 02nothing wrong with microwaved food espeon xD
<Espeon> 06much more than until 1pm and I start feeling uncomfortable for some odd reason :<
<SummerRain> welll...
<Velvet_Ribbon> (It's a metaphor for accepting being a brony.)
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm God tier in lazy
<Angel_Espeon> 13that's how ;3
<SummerRain> what shall we discuss?
<Espeon> 06nothing wrong with it but it's kind of 5/10, middle tier, okay but not better
<SummerRain> ^^
<Espeon> 06and I can live with that :3cccc
<Sunny> 02xDD
<Salad_Sandwich> ...although Celestia knows how he'd manage playing even half of the stuff I can oO
<Barry> Time travel makes your head hurt
<Sunny> 02im being so lazy now myself... just laying on my beach chair (the only I have on my room
<Salad_Sandwich> Seeing as I play guitar, drums, piano, ocarina and shinobue, to name a few.
<Sunny> 02not the ones with the plastic stripes
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm on a green computer chair
<Salad_Sandwich> Drums I can kinda see
<Cloudey> 06tommorow, when the sun rises
<Sunny> 02the fabric ones with the cup holder xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13which used to be my gaming chair downstairs
<Cloudey> 06i'll be in a car, in the mountains!
<SummerRain> Salad: That's amazing. I wish I knew, but making music isn't my thing.. just listening to it is.
<Salad_Sandwich> But guitar... I've no idea.
<Angel_Espeon> 13but then my mum broke the computer chair we used to have
<Angel_Espeon> 13so it had to be replaced by this ;-;
<Sunny> 02I want a gaming chair
<Sunny> 02xD
<Sunny> 02how did she?
<Dman> 0you are taught te song of storms so you can teach the song of storms so you can be taught te song of storms so you can teach the song of storms so you can be taught te song of storms so you can teach the song of storms so you can be taught
<Salad_Sandwich> Although at least he'd have no problem with the music making part, i.e. using software for it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well it'd been "half-broken" for a while I guess
<Sunny> 02xD
*Espeon ... hugs his chair?
<Angel_Espeon> 13she leaned back on it and the back of the chair fell off LOL
<Espeon> 06comfy
<Espeon> 06and o.o
<SummerRain> la la la la la
<Salad_Sandwich> Summer, you ever play any of the Sonic games?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just wish I was there to see it happen |D
<KershaFangs> Not as impressive as Pinkie Pie's musical virtuoso Salad.
<Sunny> 02with a camera?
<Sunny> 02xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Salad_Sandwich> And true, Pinkie's one pony band was quite impressive
<Sunny> 02YOUTUBE!!!! xD
*FallSilently was a big Sonic fan
<Salad_Sandwich> But yeah as I was about to say, I've done some arrnagements and remixes of Sonic music
<KershaFangs> Sonic became a werewolf. I cried inside.
<Salad_Sandwich> I got my hands on a Mega Drive soundfont and started making 16 bit versions of 8 bit tracks :3
<Barry> Stable time loop
<Velvet_Ribbon> Unleashed is actually fun, though.
<FallSilently> I quite liked Unleashed.
<Barry> Let's leave it at that
<Dman> 0indeedio
<FallSilently> Not quite Sonic, but still decent.
<SummerRain> .. not a big gamer-filly.
<SummerRain> I have played the original Sonic by Sega i think..?
<Velvet_Ribbon> Got the PS2 version since I can't afford a PS3 yet. :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13That reminds me, I have a video on youtube of two of my friends badly singing My Heart Will Go On on karaoke
<Angel_Espeon> 13they've been wanting me to take it down for ages
<SummerRain> .. :p
<Sunny> 02xD
<Barry> Basically, you could learn the Song of Storms, because it was a song you yourself created
<Salad_Sandwich> http://www.nautilus-solar.net/music/Jungle16bit.mp3 If you ever played the original 8-bit Sonic you'll recognise this.
<Barry> you just forgot
<Dman> 0cuh-RAY-ZEE
<Dman> 0nah
<Dman> 0you just hadn't learned it yet
<Dman> 0...
<Dman> 0you created the song, but you hadn't learned it yet 0_o
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Rodman> Hadn't learned it from yourself, that is
<KershaFangs> Sonic was too fast paced for me. I like to explore.
<Balloons> 8bit sonic?, oh from the master system and gamegear.

<SummerRain|WIFIIssues> can someone give me a link to Bucket?
<Rodman> BTW
<KershaFangs> It's okay. IT's not normal to lack an under under your bed.
<Rodman> Any of you have seen Sucker Punch?
<Sketchy_Sounds> You be stealin' a bukkit?
<Velvet_Ribbon> It's obviously not going under the bed.
<Sketchy_Sounds> I lack an under bed, technically
<SummerRain|WIFIIssues> XD BucketOfHolding, I believe it's called?
<Velvet_Ribbon> Poor Howie Mandel.
<Velvet_Ribbon> I do as well.
<FallSilently> #bucketofholding
<SummerRain|WIFIIssues> thanks
<Sketchy_Sounds> I have a bed with built-in drawers

<FallSilently> You just type that. #bucketofholding It links automatically.
<KershaFangs> Same here, Sounds.
<Dman> 0I'd count it as an A movie, even considering the money it made : /
<Sketchy_Sounds> So a horse walks into a bar
<Sketchy_Sounds> and the barman says "Why the long face?"
*Sketchy_Sounds is shot
<FallSilently> #YouCanCreateEntireUniverses

<Velvet_Ribbon> String walks into a bar. Bartender says "Hey! We don't serve your kind here!"
<KershaFangs> The horse then files a discrimination lawsuit against the establishment.
<FallSilently> Sketchy walks into a bar. The barman shoots him.
<Sketchy_Sounds> D:
<SummerRain|WIFIIssues> T_T Basically everyone in there is either asleep or away.
<Velvet_Ribbon> So the string goes outside, gets so mad it ties itself in knots and gets all frazzled on the ends.
<SummerRain|WIFIIssues> can people join me in Bucket? XD I ish bored.
<FallSilently> What is the purpose of Bucket of Holding?
<KershaFangs> Argon walks into a bar. The bartender yells, "Hey, get out of here!" Argon doesn't react.
<Velvet_Ribbon> Angry, it goes back in. Bartender says "Hey, aren't you that string was in here a minute ago?"
<Velvet_Ribbon> "Nope. I'm a frayed knot."
<Sketchy_Sounds> "Nope, I'm a frayed knot."
<Velvet_Ribbon> Beatcha to it.
*Sketchy_Sounds fails
<KershaFangs> I love that joke.
<Velvet_Ribbon> I type fast.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Don't forget the one about the panda
<Sketchy_Sounds> Eats shoots and leaves
*FallSilently is reading that book at the moment.
<FallSilently> Still no pandas, though.
*Jazza curls up in the corner
<Rodman> Comparisons to Inception? I consider them unfair

<Sketchy_Sounds> Time to try drawing this sucker
<Dman> 0Awesome visualization and interpretation of depression and escapism
<Sketchy_Sounds> Dang
