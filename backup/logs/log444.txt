*WallDives backhands FlareChaser|Colgate
<PonySwagg> otakon: I like how pissed he is.
<hen3ry> "also, if you mess this up, we're putting you on the cross next."
<pikorar> Aw...
<otakon> Darf14: much creepier in the show
<K_A> Also, random limbs. Anime likes that stuff.
<FlareChaser|Colgate> WallDives: what the HELL?
<stallion1> its like a plant person
<SamanthaGirl159> it's on a cross . . . stupid symoblism. I need more beer
<ekips> ohai #bronystate
<otakon> K_A: it's worse in the anime
<Darf14> yeah, the show is more creepier
<FillyFlam> Hiya ekips
<Silverscreen> 1,11God, the logic of this movie makes no fucking sense!
<WallDives> FlareChaser|Colgate: you made it sound more important than it was.
<otakon> Silverscreen: huh?
<stallion1> i agree
<K_A> otakon: True
<Crippler> I need more wheat beer
<FlareChaser|Colgate> WallDives: damn :P
<RAWRity> So this is, what, the THIRD time Shinji's had his "Waaaah, Saving people is hard!" crisis?
<WallDives> Shinji needs a brightslap.
<SamanthaGirl159> Silverscreen what's logic?
<Kurra> Anime never made sense.
<otakon> Silverscreen: makes more sense then Black Rock Shooter
<PrincessLuna> together forever, no matter how long, from now until the end of time, so you can be sure that forever and a day, that's how long I'll stay, together and forever more (pokemon song)
<Kandarihu> This was meant as a pretty heavy-handed deconstruction of the entire mecha genre as it existed throughout the 1980s. The whole deconstruction of "Fell Into the Cockpit" is quite obvious for example
<Galloran> LOGIC FAILS ME
<Amaron> Anime makes sense?
<pikorar> It's time to FOIL that polygon's evil plan!
<DocSane> Shinji lives in that state of crisis.
<PrincessLuna> DAT POSITRON
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Fuck gravity.
<Sumica> 00,10at least the shield is't the underbody of the space shuttle this time.
<Amaron> Try watching Black Rock.
<GabeMoist> WallDives, Indeed
<hen3ry> totally makes sense to put the emo in charge of shooting instead of the robot girl

<Darf14> He is swithing from a Heavy to a Sniper Class
<CriticKitten> Penetrate dat core
<Om> Arg, I've been speaking to much today. Got a sore thoght.

<PonySwagg> otakon: Let's be honest, I've never seen him down in Terminal Dogma before.
<GabeMoist> Capt Bright would not let this continue

<otakon> EggWhite: lol you're funny

<PonySwagg> They added something good here.
<ScootaChicken> I think Shinji's whining is a metaphor for him being a little bitch.
<ScootaChicken> Oh wait...

<otakon> http://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/163355.jpg panda there
<RyunosukeKnT> if they are using the powerlines in place, all of that power going through it would either overload the system or short it out right?
<Darf14> He sure likes to hold that position

<LunaTheBeloved> Has he seen that yet?
<Kurra> the other thing too, is that positron cannon would be useless, positrons would anihilate against air's electrons.....
<Golakka> Ohly crap, Orions <3
<ekips> throw the cheese!
<K_A> Positron is the antimatter analog to an electron: e+. I think it's normally released by radiation?
<panda> otakon: XD but you didnt stop getting shipped ^^
<Kandarihu> Gee. Shinji has the power of AN ENTIRE FIRST WORLD COUNTRY'S ENTIRE POWER GRID at his hands. Maybe missing shouldn't matter all that much.

<Unicorn_Gundam> iUgh, gag
<Sumica> 00,10sealife is all but gone
<pikorar> Acleps: It's a person who gives people chemicals that knocks them out and makes them numb and stuff. It's a dangerous job because there's a large chance they could kill a person, but they get paid TONS.
<DrunkenGirl159> flutterfan I'm guessing it has something to do with the "Second Impact"
<Litwick> panda: I like mturtles.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> :'(
<pikorar> But fish are dumb...
<flutterfan> oh

<Irish_Pony|Blind> Saturn i feel ya bro
<GabeMoist> ANTA BAK!?
<DocSane> Second Impact was THE apocalypse.
<Saturn> 08,01i see boobs
<Unicorn_Gundam> Yup
<pikorar> No Acleps, the anesthesiologists have to calculate how much of a chemical to give a person based on their weight and size.
<Dermathil> -_-
<kirz|vectors> 1,3cannot read fast + is mod = does not compute
<Unicorn_Gundam> Asuka = best
<DrunkenGirl159> Sumica red tide . . . that's caused by a type of algae? Or is it moss? Does moss grow in the ocean? Hah, I'm drunk

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Oh hai again!
<Om> DrunkenGirl159: Its prbably blood.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> SHUT UP YOU BLOODY LITTLE.....*Cant say it do to rules*
<PonySwagg> Of course Asuka is irritating.
<Kandarihu> It's Christian imagery and terminology thrown in without any of the original context. Please keep that in mind.
<Sumica> 00,10it's algae yes
<Saturn> 08,01kirz|vectors: i have the chat colour coded by user automatically
<Ponybard> no its mai meat!
<Saturn> 08,01otherwise, my eyes skip and jump

<teh_Tharassan> toegu
<Soupcan> dat was delicious!
<Kurra> O_O;

<Meanwhile> Allo SuperBrony64.
<pikorar> Fun Fact: The sky should be red because a lot of the blue of the sky comes from the reflection of the blue water on the atmosphere.
<Shizuka> 13from the original series, First Impact was what's its name hitting the Earth to spin off the Moon (thus all the moon imagery)
<Phase4> it was?

<Irish_Pony|Blind> Wondershy i have all kinds of alcohol...every...single...type...;)
<DocSane> The sky is blue due to light refraction.
<Shizuka> 13you maniacs!
<pikorar> That's the point Acleps. They could easily kill a person because some people don't react well to anesthesia.
<DrunkenGirl159> what the . . holy shit
<K_A> Hi SuperBrony64
<Wondershy> Alright... going to eat my breakfast... for dinner! :D
<IshnigoMontoya> whatcha watching?
<Litwick> Despite Neon Genesis being the most pretentious anime ever, I still give it credit in the soundtrack department.

<Kurra> Water is blue because of its physical properties, not its environment, unless there is no blue wavelength light around o.o

<Saturn> 08,01DrunkenGirl159: water has an intrinsic light blue/turqoise colour too, because it weakly absorbs red light
<DocSane> User0: I live next to the ocean. I can assure you, water is not blue.

<DeadpoolDash> ah the catch
<Darf14> I just realized.....That Angel is in SPAAAACCCEEE!!!

I have also built a very long ceiling above the game world. Does anyone think this will be enough to defeat The Destroyer?
<User0> Cypresswolf: they're used to it
<pikorar> Acleps, documentaries.
<Unicorn_Gundam> Misato: *trollface*
<DrunkenGirl159> Saturn actually your text reminds me of this funky drink I had one time. RYan made it for me and it tasted good but now he can't make it again because we were both drunk when he made it
<Litwick> Ghosties: I have a rock.

<Kurra> Ghosties, just level grind until 2035, and then try, guaranteed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Go Asuka.
<Vordox> The Ankle, or what's it called, doubles your invul time after getting a hit.
<Kurra> I have no idea what game that's even about XD
<pikorar> Acleps: Unfortunately alot of the stuff I learn is fake... I regret to admit.

<PonySwagg> Asuka.
<PonySwagg> We all hate you.
<DeadpoolDash> time to run fast
<K_A> Also, cross.
<Acleps> pikorar: Fake? How?
<Purple`Prose> And now, let's defy some physics
<Unicorn_Gundam> Asuka is hot
<Shizuka> 13they haven't developed asuka enough at this point to explain her psychological issues
<Phase4> i assume its actualy diablo though
<Ghosties> 04In order to get the Flamethrower I need to have defeated Skeletron Prime. No fucking way I'm going after him the way I am now
<PonySwagg> Unicorn_Gundam: Yes, but she's also a total bitch.
<DeadpoolDash> she has alot of issues
<Meanwhile> I hope when they do it makes me hate her less.
<Shizuka> 13the original series explanation is completely out since she's friends with THE DOLL
<FlareChaser|TF2> did the red bitch die yet?
<pikorar> Acleps: I just have huge volumes of false information in my brain from stuff I hear from unreliable resources, Acleps.
<Saturn> 08,01is that a giant mech?
<Meanwhile> Because so far I want to slam her face in a door.
<DrunkenGirl159> Saturn I don't always get drunk, but when I do . . . I use a meme without myself knowing about it until I've typed out half my message
<DocSane> Asuka has the powers of red hair and tsundere personality

<junh1024-XD> they had an attic (my first time going into an attic)
<drfsupercenter> 03and those are *obvious* ones

<Kosoveon> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what?
<Ran> 2I honestly think it tastes better <3
<drfsupercenter> 03so you'd actually order a pizza, refridgerate it and then eat it the next day? LOl
<Kosoveon> also fridge pizza isn't bad
<Kosoveon> you just wanna eat it relatively soon after you refridgerate it
<Ran> 2No, I do eat what I can while it's fresh but always save a couple of slices for breakfast
<drfsupercenter> 03Hungry Howie's just tastes gross to me if it's not fresh

<drfsupercenter> 03my sisters do that

<drfsupercenter> 03had all the planets
<drfsupercenter> 03I wore it to school once

<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03this was back when I was a social outcast (well, I still am)
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'd rather get the GOOD kind of attention
<drfsupercenter> 03than people just going LOL YOUR SHIRT IS EMBARRASING
<drfsupercenter> 03so, I became known as that kid who gave everybody TI-83+ calculator games, as well as getting around the school filters
<Ran> 2Calculator games what
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep
<Kosoveon> pokemon stadium on a calculator
<drfsupercenter> 03I took my DS around, but some teachers got mad if I was playing Mario Kart in class

<Ran> 2I can't comprehend that lol
<Ran> 2The games that is
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom got mad
<drfsupercenter> 03because my math teacher told her at conferences

<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03the sad thing is, in retrospect, I just got used by everybody
<drfsupercenter> 03I have very few *actual* friends from high school
<drfsupercenter> 03most of them were like GEE THANKS FOR THE GAMES *runs off and badmouths me to friends*
<drfsupercenter> 03but I was (and probably still am to a point) too desperate for people to notice the fact that I exist, so I went along with it :|
<drfsupercenter> 03...which reminds me of this time I actually got Articuno to join me in making a kid feel bad for harassing me online :D

<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03well, he left the page up until about a year ago
<drfsupercenter> 03and my mom was googling my name to see what came up
<drfsupercenter> 03and that was one of the first results
<drfsupercenter> 03she was like "did you know about this?" and I was like "of course I did, I wrote back"
<drfsupercenter> 03and she's like "You do realize that if you apply for a job, people cna google you and that just makes you look bad"
<drfsupercenter> 03so she called the guy's parents lik e"can you tell your son to get rid of that?"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like >_> <_< I can take care of myself mom
<drfsupercenter> 03but whatever XD
<Ran> 2Do potential employers really care about what high-schoolers say lol
<drfsupercenter> 03prolly not
<drfsupercenter> 03but they'd ask I guess
<drfsupercenter> 03she's paranoid
<drfsupercenter> 03she thinks you all are rapists :D
<junh1024-XD> whee
<drfsupercenter> 03wait crap
<drfsupercenter> 03I lost the picture I took of Arti's and my reply

<Dr_Fumbles> hello
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Contrary to popular belief, a body double was not used for Chris Evans for the scenes when he was skinny. The filmmakers had originally planned to hire a body double and superimpose Evans' face onto the double's body, but ultimately scrapped the idea since director Joe Johnston claimed that Evans moved in a unique way and that no body double could replicate his
<Onebrony> "I had him on the ropes" Obviously

<Michael> hai Dr_Fumbles
<Joccy> wow
<Aylnine> he looks cute skinny
<Litwick> Barnes..... James Barnes....
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ultimately, the filmmakers utilized digital technology to "shrink" Evans down, essentially erasing portions of his physique, until they came up with what the filmmakers called "Skinny Steve". Over 250 shots were filmed like this, and because the shrinking process left empty space in the background, many of the scenes had to be filmed in front of a green screen so that they could
<Silverscreen> 1,11superimpose the backgrounds back into the scene. Even attempts to double him for long distance shots and the scene where Steve chases down Kruger failed due to Chris having a unique and unduplicatable way of moving.

<GilDash> PrincessLuna: What'cha working on, Princess? :)
<Aegis3423> agent schmitt :D
<CK|Ded> I truly do respect Steve Rogers as a character, because of scenes like that. It helps really show why Captain America differs from others: he's willing to make sacrifices for the greater good, in every way necessary.
<Cananor> HEIL HYDRA
<Onebrony> Johan Smith= Agent Smith..PERFECT SENSE
<pikorar> In the hospital? You mean like, hospitalized?

<CK|Ded> He's legitimately virtuous, despite being a guy who has every reason to hate the way his life has played out so far, and that makes him likeable. It's why, in the comics, it turns out that he's virtuous enough to wield the hammer of Thor.

<otakon> Ninjazz|FeelinUnwell: no, why?
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: definitely Vibranium.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So, why does that guy have to wear that outfit?
<CK|Ded> Saxy: Give it a few minutes :P
<Floris> I feel sorry for those few gay soldiers in there, they probably wanted more of Captain America. :(
<Onebronytorule> America Monkey on a unicycle.
<MI9000> he really needs to upgread that suit
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dat drawing
<cachi01> this was before his shield was made by nokia
<Wrek> 05heroic morchok dead
<RyunosukeKnT> SaxyPretender: that shield needs to be more aerodynamic
<CECtheRonin> Ninjazz about what?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: he's nothing more then a publicity stunt
<Onebronytorule> Morchok is down?
<Onebronytorule> Good work!
<Meanwhile> Gratz Wrek.
<valoreins> captain is a good drafter.. :)
<Kandarihu> How ...Weimar-esque of those U.S. soldiers.
<RAWRity> Adamantium is shitty knockoff of Vibranium
<pikorar> Captain America's first idea for a sidekick was that monkey.
<Ninjazz|FeelinUnwell> Well, he gets shot up with God knows what. And they treat him like a prop or something.
<Onebronytorule> PVP is where it's at however.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's a waste of fancy chemicals.
<RainbowAsh> Nittany_Discord, I wish I knew. Why don't they send him to fight, they modified him to do just that, didn't they?
<Kattchips-Pony> He needs a dimondium sheild.
<Space> I'd be the monkey
<otakon> RAWRity: the HELL you say, Admantium is friggin UNBREAKABLE dammit
<MI9000> he is both
<Floris> Captain America should be a homosexual, screw stereotypes!
<CECtheRonin> RAWRity Oh my, no.
<crazypony> monkey america
<Soupcan> lol
<Invi> I liek monkies ^^
<pikorar> We're all monkeys on the inside...
<otakon> Floris: no, that's Spiderman
<Space> unless a more fun option is available?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We spent millions on a propaganda program.
<CK|Ded> otakon: So is vibranium.
<Tovler> Floris: Agreed
<cachi01> fun fact: nokias are made of adamantium
<Kandarihu> Floris: no. Just no
<hen3ry> Captain really LOVES America.
<SirGanjalf> If only they got Nintendium...
<Bjornfot> fuck yeah Floris, homosexuality is manly as hell
<Onebronytorule> Captain Homosexuala? Doesn't work.
<Silverscreen> 1,11That Steve Rogers sketches costume designs for Howard Stark and is caught doodling pictures of himself as a circus monkey refers to the comics' depiction of Cap's alter ego as an artist since 1979 - he even worked on the fictional Captain Amareica comic book published on Marvel Earth. +
<GilDash> pikorar: You're a monkey on the inside. ;)
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Why do you keep saying 'the hell you say'?
<otakon> Nitram: he was the only one to be made
<Space> Nittany_Discord: Never thought of it that way
<Invi> pikorar i guess on the inside I have organs
<otakon> ScootaChicken: bc I like saying that
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hydra spies tried to steal fancy chemicals that create icons
<RAWRity> otakon: actually, it's not. Adamantium, in canon, is the closest thing humanity's come to synthesizing vibranium.
<WallDives> needs moar Phoenix.
<Onebronytorule> :D
<Viri> 14I hate how all different phone companies got a different keynumber for space xDD
<Tovler> What's the difference between Vibranium and Acoustium?
<Ninjazz|FeelinUnwell> He just want to fight in the war. He wants to help.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: It doesn't even make sense, it's like 'I could care less'.
<Soupcan> say that to homophobic christians lol
<Conyst> one million monkeys
<pikorar> Organs, Invi? You chould get that checked out by a doctor... That soudns dangerous.
<Onebronytorule> O.o...I can do faces....
<WallDives> you cant control it.
<Onebronytorule> Muaha...Muaha..MAUAHAHAJA
<Space> bro!
<Viri> 14sometimes it's 1, sometimes 0, sometimes #
<Floris> Woah, I got a lot of comments when speaking about Homosexuality.. Geesh, internet is crazy!
<RAWRity> It's actually established in the comics that Wolverine can't cut through Cap's sheild.
<Onebronytorule> ;d
<Silverscreen> 1,11The 107th Infantry is a lesser known Army unit, so lesser know that typing it in Wikipedia won't even direct you to the unit's page under its better known name, The 7th Regiment of New York, a unit that did serve in WWI.
<stallion1> two million monkeys
<SirGanjalf> :F
<otakon> RAWRity: but all vibranium does is vibrate, it's not unbreakable
<RAWRity> so yeah, Vibranium>Adamantium
<CK|Ded> otakon: Cap's vibranium shield can sustain a blow from Thor's hammer. >_> Adamantium is a vibranium synthetic
<Floris> And, yes.. Technically it is the manliest since it are two men.
<MI9000> NERD MODE: capts shield is made of an unknown combination of steel and vibranium
<Litwick> Give me Barnes..... James Barnes...
<RyunosukeKnT> hey Sumica are we gonna have a marvel marathon this summer?
<MI9000> but in this movie it is just vibranium
<Eddmario> Captain Amareica is best Marvel movie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it can't take a shot from the Serpent's hammer though, CK|Ded
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Great mission!
<otakon> CK|Ded: Cap's Shield is Vibranium/Adamantium mix you know? It has the quality of both metals and is near indestructable
<StinkomanFan> I like Cap'
<Floris> Captain Mexico.
<Invi> pikorar I try to kill them with Coke and energydrinks and fast food all the time, but it doesn't work. :(
<Sumica> 00,10not that i know of but who knows what tomorrow may bring.

<OmegaMetroidBrony> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHhh
<Floris> Captain Equestria?
<Kandarihu> Let's not have a Marvel Marathon until the Avengers comes out on home video.
<MI9000> adamantium is the attemted copy of caps shield
<StinkomanFan> Only 3 times in almost one hundred years?
<CK|Ded> Saxy: Yeah, usually as a stunt by Marvel to make the enemy seem threatening. :p
<Silverscreen> 1,11Jones is an awesome actor.
<WallDives> cap's shield didnt protect him from being assassinated.
<Ryanier128> SaxyPretender something like that
<Space> where is the super shield?
<cachi01> catain mexico is worst captain
<pikorar> Try cyanide, alcohol, and cigarettes, Invi, that should speed things up alot.

<Onebronytorule> Heh.
<pony_300> usually by cosmic powers though; Thanos with infinity gauntlet, thor with odin power...
<Soupcan> lets watch thor next
<RAWRity> Space: be patient
<Ryanier128> Space Stark has to invent it still
<stallion1> hey

<MyLittleDashie> THE OLD GUY IS AGENT K
<Ninjazz|FeelinUnwell> Shit might have just got real.
<Jim> One does not simply walk to Austria
<SirGanjalf> Silverscreen: I concur
<Tovler> Kandarihu stole my wait-for-avangers comment
<Floris> Woah, cliché scene.

<CK|Ded> And Steve becomes even more best pony
<alexxm> does he start molesting the nazis now
<Tovler> *Avengers*

<Silverscreen> 1,11Red Skull's deformed appearance is explained by his body's rejection of the serum because he was not worthy - the serum drives him even madder. This is exactly what happens to Emil Blonsky which leads to his transformation into the Abomination, with the help of gamma rays, in The Incredible Hulk.
<MadSurge> "The Red Skull's got no nose!" "How does he smell?" "...awful."

<Silverscreen> 1,11Johann Schmidt/Red Skull's car was built from scratch over a modified truck chassis. It was 25 feet long and eight feet wide. Its design was inspired by the Mercedes 540K and the Mercedes G4, and included an exposed "supercharger" between the front wheels. The car had a 700 horsepower Drexler engine just to move it. Director Joe Johnston actually took it for a drive: "I drove it myself
<Silverscreen> 1,11and it has about a 38-feet turning radius. So it's not a lot of fun to drive. But it looked fantastic. Just a beautiful car."

<StinkomanFan> The Battalions Backup!
<Silverscreen> 1,11In the scene where Steve and the Howling Commandos are going to jump on the train, it is mentioned that they intercepted an encrypted communication.

<Silverscreen> 1,11This isn't the first time a key part in a person's plot to overthrow Adolf Hitler was named Valkyrie (although the pony in question this time had an evil motive, unlike the real life and movie version.).

<Jim> Curse of the time lords
<Combustiblelemons> that really sucks.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash what?
<Aylnine> empty chairs at empty tablessss
*Bjornfot hugs CaptainIshmerica "ok..."
<CptGanjalf> Worst. Side effect. Ever

<TimberWolf> drink 4x as much?
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: He can't get drunk. :(
<panda> Bjornfot: D: i didnt know you thought like that.... i mean it is cool and to be honest he was the symbolism behind what helped up win world war 2. i dont think its propaganda but i see where you are coming from. never the less, its an awesome comic and move
<DerpStar> Wins all drinking games
<WallDives> aww, half time and no score = no liquor.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash *GGGGGGGGGGGAAASSSSSSPPPPPP*

<PONY> I'd be more dangerous than ever... Since I would lose my will to live
<Wheatley> idiots
<Soupcan> lol bjornfot trying to bring realism in a fictional movie lol
<CaptainIshmerica> otakon in the comics he's frozen, so it can still work
<Invi> if my grandpa would make the alcohol, he would get drunk ^^
<Meanwhile> panda: He's a character created entirely for propoganda.
<Meanwhile> That was his purpose.
<GLaDOS> Wheatley: Says the moron core.
<Conyst> try a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster that will get you drunk

<Soupjuice> kinda like Dr. Caulder, with his giant bomber
<Wheatley> GlaDOS: im the one that is keeping you alive, cus u know its bloody hard to survive
<Bjornfot> It's just that stuff like Captain America and Duke Nukem are things that make me feel bad for USA.
<otakon> CaptainIshmerica: the ONLY reason Rogers doesn't kick it is bc he's a Supersoldier
<Eddmario> Call Winston Churchill and have him send over some Daleks
<Soupjuice> you know, advanced wars days of ruin/dark conflict
<RAWRity> panda: no, for real. The original captain america comics were propoganda in order to sell war bonds and drum up support for the US army in WWII.

<CK|Ded> inb4 good line
<Silverscreen> 1,11Lil_B: All Germans Are Nazis: Surprisingly and gratifyingly averted, for ONCE. They actually only mention Nazis/Hitler a few times, and the conflict between Captain Amareica and HYDRA (who break away from the Nazis early in the film) is really only set in the 1940s, but the actual War is pretty much ignored. This trope is outright defied by Dr. Erskine, who claims that Germany was the
<Silverscreen> 1,11first country to be invaded by and fall victim to the Nazis (something that he also notes is what many ponies tend to forget).
<Kencolt> One of the whole points of the Captain America Mythos is Bucky is DEAD. Whoever brought him back missed that.
