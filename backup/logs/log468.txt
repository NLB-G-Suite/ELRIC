<HyperMetalLugia> you do know

<Dark92Enigma> 600 ATK plus for my monster
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkler: well, since i'm an english major, i dont necessarily find it boring. at least not if the actual subject material is interesting. last semester i was taking a class on the different types of analysis that can be used when reviewing texts, normally could have been kind of boring, but my professor is a very intelligent man who i have a lot of respect for and he made it very engaging
<Lambo> Way to make conclusions
<cachi01|writingessay> so many stormtroopers in the world
<DerpStar> I'd put up with Prince Blue Blood because I'd become a princess and I could meet Cadance

<twilight_sprinkler> Ingwaz: well im writing a paper for english composition, and what i hate about that class is that they teach publicity writing, the tyoe if writing to get people to read, not strong scientific paper
<Randomnerd> Cadence=Rythm
<Randomnerd> Ingwaz: Who's on First.
<CK|Ded> Why doesn't he just explain it again?
<DerpStar> It just means of high birth superretroworld
<CK|Ded> All he has to do is stall the cops until he can return to the past.
<CK|Ded> >_>
<DerpStar> I can change him!
<twilight_sprinkler> Ingwaz: they say that if a claim is debatable then its good. imo thats ridiculous, if im going to make science thesis i want to be as full-proof as possible
<RaveBrony> aimbot >.>
<CK|Ded> So why not just admit it all?
<grovyleshy_wood> THEY'RE MOOKS
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkler: hmm... i can do that type of writing, but normally i prefer analytical writing
<cachi01|writingessay> CK|Ded: he is a kid and they re adults tht just want to destroy what they see.. u think they will hear him :D

<Mish> wait whut
<Mish> a pony anotholgy?!
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkler: oh, well, thats not so bad then. thats a lot of what english is. its not necessarily outright proving something in your writing, but debating it, exploring it. science, if you're writing about something, chances are you're proving it. in english, you can write a 30 page paper on how such and such writer inadvertandly made their novel very sexual even if it has nothing sexually suggestive in it at first glance
<grovyleshy_wood> DerpStar: I think this is the full version
<Litwick> Journey yeah!

<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkler: language is a an uncertain thing. it really is not a science. so just because a writer might say something, they could mean something drastically different for many different reasons, part of english is exploring that

<grovyleshy_wood> Is it wrong that I REALLY don't like RD? I think she's too brash and too ready to start fights. She can really be mean and stuff.
<Ingwaz> twilight_sprinkler: i like some parts of science, but i'm not really the scientist type, at least not fully. I like to be very precise and explore things and figure out why they work and how to replicate those results. but i dunno, its just something i like to do for fun, as a sort of hobby
<Mish> Wow

<otakon> If you get back in time.........holy shit this is INSANE
<CupcakeWarrior> mfw this was the first anime Hideaki Anno directed
<otakon> ICH!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Go ALL the speed!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> @geek thats what you think
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03help would be appreciated :/
<otakon> Okay, HOW the hell are they withstanding that
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: Why are you questioning things in a gainax anime?
<geeky-brony> nope
<hen3ry> problem is, radio also travels at light speed...
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: because this one has a BIT of realism in it
<otakon> it's the Luxion
<DeathStar> Paladin_Drakkenwolf: protip if you type in part of someones nic and press tab it outo compleats it and pings them
<Sumica> 00,10papa's ship
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dun dun dun
<geeky-brony> her papa
<otakon> and then she went awol
<Sumica> 00,106month SAR
<otakon> 2 DAYS!?
<otakon> hasn't it been like 8 years for her?
<Sumica> 00,101min = 3 months
<hen3ry> minutes at high velocity are months at regular velocity...
<MahBoi777> time is funneh
<otakon> Sumica: I know that, but still
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gotta love time dilation.
<CupcakeWarrior> How is 1 minute 3 months?
<hen3ry> time dilation
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: going at the speed of light
<CupcakeWarrior> That makes no sense
<hen3ry> it's relativity
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How fast are they going? .9c?
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: it's a bit complicated
<SaxyPretender> 0,14when you're moving near the speed of light, time kinda goes wonky
<Sumica> 00,10time slows down the faster you go
<hen3ry> ,998 c I think
<otakon> well, he is surely dead
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1794/
<mario_pony> :|
<CupcakeWarrior> This is what I get for not paying attention to the first episode
<mario_pony> stupid internet connection
<MahBoi777> derp?
<otakon> HURRY HURRY!
<Sumica> 00,10this has little to do with the first ep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01gamma = sqrt(1 - (0.998)^2)
<CupcakeWarrior> ewww math
<geeky-brony> time is weird just by pulling a sowrd out of the gornd u can become a adult put teh sowrd in and u a kid agen wtf
<otakon> geeky-brony: lol dat Ocarina of Time
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: ENGLISH PLZ
<geeky-brony> yup
<CupcakeWarrior> dat grammar fail 0_0
<CupcakeWarrior> spelling*
<Rain> you know, to keep their same speed, they wouldnt need their jets going >_>
<otakon> 12 seconds?
<Sumica> 00,10so around 3 weeks late
<otakon> crap
<geeky-brony> ledgin of zelda ocrina of time joke MahBoi777
<Sumica> 00,10ships done
<hen3ry> 3 weeks late. she missed her period.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And they would go far.
<Sumica> 00,10love this march theme
<otakon> and the SHIP IS FINISHED!
<geeky-brony> lol
<DeathStar> Rain: yeah I often find it anoying when people forget that
<otakon> hen3ry: no, for them it's only been 10 minutes
<hen3ry> well it was 10 minutes, therefore... 2 1/2 years
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: lol I know, jurst so meny spelleeng airors
<otakon> hen3ry: no, 1 minute=3 months normal time
<Rain> although, the other ship was jetting too, so they were constiantly accelerating the entire time
<mario_pony> all that misspelling
<CupcakeWarrior> How many more episodes are there of this?
<mario_pony> it's killing me
<Sumica> 00,10Law of Constant Thrust, First Law of Anime Motion
<Sumica> 00,10In space, constant thrust equals constant velocity.
<hen3ry> otakon: and 4 min per year, so 10 min is 2.5 years
<geeky-brony> i know i suck at spilin words
<otakon> therefore, 20 seconds=month
<Kyu> 07k

<hen3ry> so put 40,000 of those on your warships, instead of those useless huge ass cannons
*DeathStar busts some guns
<Ghosties> 04<CupcakeWarrior> There should be a Bronystate anime <-- Only if I can be involved for absolutely no reason, no bearing on the main plot at all
<otakon> hen3ry: it's experimental tech that isn't full proof
<Sumica> 00,10Ghosties would have a music bit
<Polydunami> I'm glad SOMEPONY knows what I'm talking about :3
<DeathStar> Ghosties: so like chat is normaly?
<Ghosties> 04I could be hiding behind a curtain or something
<hen3ry> otakon: it works better than what they've got
<GabeMoist> Ghosties, you ARE the curtain
<hen3ry> in the mean time - cancel ALL the laws of physics
<otakon> hen3ry: it's the ONLY ONE MADE SO FAR

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bye JRP

<Sumica> 00,10ah oki, sleep well SaxyPretender
<Monfang> As soon as Kongou Banchou comes out as an anime, we should watch it.
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: it was more along the lines of current anime, yes... but Diebuster was one of the first Mecha anime i watched and i wish more was like it...
<Polydunami> Anyway, yeah, School Days' last episode was actually cancelled in Japan because of similarities to real life news
<drfsupercenter> 03god dang, they don't even give me enough ink to write a letter
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: Gunbuster, sorry
<SaxyPretender> 0,14thanks for streaming this though, been wanting to see it
<Polydunami> And that's why we have Nice Boat
<CupcakeWarrior> Polydunami: So there is no ending?
<GabeMoist> Polydunami, Nice boat...
<CupcakeWarrior> Polydunami: Nice boat? Whats that?
<MahBoi777> awwwwwww

*Midnight_Tempest is turqoise
<the_real_pony_1604> name of this?
<CupcakeWarrior> DREEEEAM WEAVER
<GabeMoist> It was horrible
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: you mean more scientifically sound and less gibberish?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cheerilee's a whore.
<Polydunami> It's a meme: they replaced the last episode of School Days with footage of nature and stuff
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: she is NOT
<GabeMoist> And boats
<Polydunami> One part of the footage was a boat
<Polydunami> Yeah
<GabeMoist> footage of nice boats
<CupcakeWarrior> Polydunami: Is there an actual last episode
*Ghosties slaps Nittany_Discord around a bit with a large trout
<Polydunami> There is
<GabeMoist> CupcakeWarrior, yes
<Ghosties> 04How dare you talk about Cheerilee like that! :O
*CupcakeWarrior polkas
<twilight_sprinkler> that ytp has destroyed hearts and whooves for good
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: yeah, more realistic and scientifically plausible
<otakon> Polydunami: oh yeah, the whole "Show nature" when something is particularily ciolent
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon and Ghosties: But Sweetie Belle said so herself.
<Ghosties> 04Have you no manners?
<Polydunami> Yep
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: SHE DID NOT
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: and there was even a picture!
*Pinkies4thWall|Xbox agrees with Nittany_Discord
<Ghosties> 04Sweetie Belle is just a kid :I
<Polydunami> Weird Al sounds better than Lady Gaga
<otakon> and a robot
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: It was from a ytp
<Ghosties> 04She doesn't know what she's talking about :I
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: I know.....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like Cheerilee, but I heard it from Sweetie Belle. She had a pic.
<otakon> anyway, I'm off to bed myself as well

<Pinkies4thWall|Xbox> Nittany_Discord: pics or it didnt happen right?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah there is Polydunami, but I dont have it

<CupcakeWarrior> dat Baby
<GabeMoist> There was supposed to be a storm tonight, but there wasn't even rain, only a long power outage

<geeky-brony> i fell left out
<RainBowJack> damn thats made by the same artist as this anime
<dishwasher_EXTREME> aww shit america
<Kencolt> otakon: BZZZZZT! But thanks for playing. Before Evangelion, almost EVERY Space/Mecha anime had at least ONE person who was either dying or doomed to die. And you could tell who it waws early on. Although everyone acted surprised.
<otakon> RainBowJack: not that one! It's got pretty art and tbh the best anime boobs ever concieved but dammit all it's so short.
<MahBoi777> dishwasher_EXTREME: Lol
<Tassadork> llllllludicrous speed
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, not in Legend of Koizumi (Well the manga version at least)
<otakon> RainBowJack: Gainax didn't do Plastic Little.
<geeky-brony> :( no one loves me
<RainBowJack> otakon : indeed but Plastic little is a great anime i loved the humor in it
<Polydunami> geeky-brony, please don't get down on yourself

<otakon> RainBowJack: yeah, it did have a good sense of humour and pacing, but they spend a good chunk of itin the bath.
<GabeMoist> ?wat?
<Polydunami> I know the feeling of beating on oneself
<Kencolt> to quote Roion in "The Hunger Dogs" by Kack Kirby-- "ALL I NEED ARE TARGETS."
*geeky-brony hugs RainBowJack back
<geeky-brony> yay
<Kencolt> *Orion

<Midnight_Tempest> its not a shipwreck, the ship was sent empty as a bomb
<geeky-brony> kill dem kill dem alll
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: however, they need it to go critical so it makes a black hole to suck in the enemy fleet
<dshannon> uhhh worst motivational speech ever

<otakon> seriously, they must have killed millions by now
<hen3ry> homing. laser.
<MahBoi777> holy shit

<dshannon> pretty sure that was a bad idea
<Midnight_Tempest> there was no one on the ship...
<dishwasher_EXTREME> that ship created a supernova
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: at was launched out there as a bomb asn escorted
<CupcakeWarrior> ah
<Tassadork> at the low low price of creating a black hole near sol system
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Looks like they killed a galaxy.

<MahBoi777> gnight CupcakeWarrior!
<Sumica> 00,10seems it was supposed to be in black in white to give it an arttistic feal
<hen3ry> so they destroyed three planets, and probably had to break down a fourth just to get enough raw materials to build it
<otakon> Yeah, Amano has ged a bit
<hen3ry> good thing they had 9 planets when they did this series.
<dshannon> who dafuq is this lady
<otakon> hen3ry: hell, that's probably what they were talking abou in destroying planets
<geeky-brony> night CupcakeWarrior
<Kandarihu> Yeah. Gainax didn't really run out of money until 2 episodes from the end of Evangelion TV
<Sumica> 00,10the lady is "big sister"
<dshannon> is what just ran through that girls head
<otakon> dshannon: it's Amano

<hen3ry> well naturally. I mean, Jupiter is the second biggest bomb we have... and the Sun is NOT an option
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They built it around the planet Jupiter?
<BlueFlare> 02I have no idea why they give you ink limits
<Kencolt> Midnight_Tempest: Myself, I have always had a deep and abiding love of Sailor Moon. Sort of a gateway for me, as were early fansubs...
<otakon> Vordox: traveling at lightspeed will do that
<hen3ry> yet we still use huge useless laser cannons
<BlueFlare> 02to save space on their servers I guess
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: they USED Jupiter to build it
<Polydunami> Kencolt, that was the same for me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They really like screwing up the solar system.
<Sumica> 00,10only 6 billion enemys
<BlueFlare> 02wait, that wouldn't be why
<Polydunami> It was the one that got me back into anime
<MahBoi777> take that Jupiter
<otakon> Sumica: ONLY!?
<mario_pony> o3o
<Midnight_Tempest> Kencolt: yeah, i liked Sailor Moon too... it was silly
<SirGanjalf> that's a one bigass pill
<Polydunami> Also, Sailor Moon was the very first anime I watched
<BlueFlare> 02would take up just as much space no matter how much ink you used XD
<geeky-brony> hay RainBowJak
<drfsupercenter> 03KIK
<drfsupercenter> 03*LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03It's just because they're stupid
<Kencolt> A;though the first anime I ever saw was the original AstroBoy when it first showed on CBS. Or NBC-- I forget which, yeah, I'm that old.
<Polydunami> Actually, my sister watched it and my mother disapproved
<Midnight_Tempest> first anime i watched was Ranma 1/2
<Sumica> 00,10now 8 billion
<Polydunami> Ranma 1/2 gets all kinds of silly
<Midnight_Tempest> first mecha anime i watched was this Gunbuster...
<Kandarihu> It makes sense to measure velocity in terms of % of light speed
<dshannon> so you athiest can gtfo off of my ship!
<dshannon> lol
<Polydunami> But in terms of silliness, Ranma 1/2 doesn't hold a candle to One Piece
<geeky-brony> agred
<hen3ry> "Do you believe in God?" "No, Captain." "Hmm. How about airlocks?"
<Kandarihu> Technically, the first anime I watched was the dub of Go Lion. But I didn't get into anime until I saw the dub of Sailor Moon.
<dshannon> no #@$%
<MahBoi777> how cud they NOT notice it?
<otakon> Well, the Space Monsters aren't stupid are they
<BlueFlare> 02"Let’s make it like real old fashioned witting and give you an ink limit LOL. u mad?"
*Pinkies4thWall has never seen Sailor Moon
<Polydunami> Pinkies4thWall, try it out
<otakon> YES!
<geeky-brony> hay MahBoi777 what was the first anima u wached
<otakon> crap
<Dark_Horst> is that a planetsized bomb?
<otakon> WHY ARE THEY NOT DIEING?!
<BlueFlare> 02must be what they were thinking
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: Dragonball Z
<Polydunami> dat +k
<Sumica> 00,10montage!
<otakon> Dark_Horst: eeyup
<geeky-brony> same here to MahBoi777
<Polydunami> I am hearing Hallelujah Chorus
<MahBoi777> d.....did they win?
<Midnight_Tempest> not yet
<otakon> MahBoi777: no idea yet
<BlueFlare> 02Swapnote recordings limit would be to save server space however
<geeky-brony> murder
*DeathStar dances back into chat
<Kencolt> OK. Sense just flew OUT the window.
*Pinkies4thWall walks into chat
<Sumica> 00,10Just?
<Polydunami> What else is new?
<otakon> hiya DeathStar you are JUST in time for the ending of Gunbuster
<mario_pony> .-.
<DeathStar> otakon: yay?
<Midnight_Tempest> pfft... this montage was awesome...
<otakon> DeathStar: yes yay
<MahBoi777> wb DeathStar, how was DINNER? :P
<Tassadork> most inappropriate songs ever
*geeky-brony jumps on DeathStar and giv big hug
<otakon> Wow, Buster Machine # 3 is beat up
<DeathStar> MahBoi777: corn beefy and mashpotato filled
<otakon> Wait, Sumica how many ships did they have before?
<MahBoi777> mmmmmmm
*DeathStar hugs geeky-brony back
<geeky-brony> yay
<SirGanjalf> I may be wrong, but i think that was the part that saved some budget
<Sumica> 00,108000 or so
<DeathStar> otakon: almost aes many as you used to hav
<Midnight_Tempest> i thought they had over 250L
<Midnight_Tempest> K*
<otakon> Sumica: well, it went better then the first real fight
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but really, 5 seconds?
<drfsupercenter> 03they should have just left it 10
<Sumica> 00,10why are they hanging around for the implosion?
<hen3ry> damn windows 95
<Tassadork> ruh roh
<Polydunami> Studio Gainax is infamous for playing inappropriate songs for the mood
<BlueFlare> 02I think it should be like 1 or 2 minutes
<otakon> wait WHAT?!
<geeky-brony> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It broke.
<DeathStar> Sumica: because imposions are cool
<Polydunami> Or something
<otakon> it broke at 98% !?
<Vordox> STORY TIMING!
<BlueFlare> 02that would be fair
<Sumica> 00,10not to self put important componantes inside the armor
<MahBoi777> don wanna miss that awesome implosion
<dshannon> -_-
<Polydunami> The miracle never happen
<hen3ry> first officer sez "Told you so."
<SirGanjalf> How dis they missed that?
<otakon> Sumica: they DID, did you see how banged up it is?
<geeky-brony> true MahBoi777
<MahBoi777> lol
<Sumica> 00,10but the pilons around the outside ahre the important part
<Tassadork> o rly? they lose 5500 ships and guy is bothered about one more life?
<BlueFlare> 02But then people might try to use it like a phone
<otakon> Tassadork: and the most powerful weapon they have that isn't disposable
<geeky-brony> http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/MLP_71e96f_2216427.jpg
<hen3ry> not the life. That ship. The busters are the only things they have that work
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's the protagonist, though.
<drfsupercenter> 03so what?
<Kencolt> And how long will it be until we ponies in gunbuster uniforms?
<drfsupercenter> 03why limit the abilities of something you own?
<Polydunami> Oh god

<RainBowJack> i have to go bye bye everypony

<Vordox> Okay, close enough
<Tassadork> wat
<Dark_Horst> ofcourse they built a city to say hi
<Sumica> 00,1012k years on earth, almost no time to them
<hen3ry> "we wrote it in ancient japanese"
<Polydunami> Okaerinasai
<DeathStar> daaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww <3
<BlueFlare> 02like apps that really are good
<Midnight_Tempest> then color
<BlueFlare> 02unlike a lot of the wii's apps
<dshannon> yep because all other forms of entertainment have run thier course
<Polydunami> Wait, they still used Japanese!?
<Kandarihu> 800 hours to them. I just crunched those numbers.
<otakon> Damn, I can't believe they remembered them after 12K years
<Vordox> Sumica: So...they are 12000 years dumber? :P
<MahBoi777> how nice
<geeky-brony> :)
<Tassadork> I bet they STILL haven't built another gunbuster
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did the fix global warming? =p
<SirGanjalf> Midnight_Tempest: SYMBOLISM!
<MahBoi777> otakon: ikr

*drfsupercenter runs
<Kencolt> Tassadork: They don't need to now.
<Polydunami> And they didn't even think to travel to where they were?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: THEY COULD TRAVEL ACROSS THE GALAXY, I think so.
<geeky-brony> well that was awesome
<Polydunami> Or wait, that would mean more time screwing
<Midnight_Tempest> i like how Diebuster also ends with those two coming back...
<Sumica> 00,10yeah they moved earth further from the sun in diebuster
<otakon> Polydunami: the Black Hole caused a HUGE time dilation gap
<Aurora> 6I'm with drf on this one lol...
<Polydunami> DAMMIT
<MahBoi777> indeed geeky-brony
*geeky-brony starts dancing like a idot
<Dark_Horst> they built a CITY! to say HI!!!
<hen3ry> 12,000 years ago, humanity had yet to acquire basic civilization. 12k years later...
<BlueFlare> 02well, swamnote is one of them, even though they went insane on limits
<BlueFlare> 02swapnote*
<Kencolt> City hell. The built a PLANET.
<otakon> hen3ry: we be cruising the Galaxy
<Samsa> wait, why did noone go out to get them half way?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why move the Earth?
<otakon> Samsa: no idea
<Polydunami> Humanity is underrated and overrated at the same time
<hen3ry> of course, in 12k years, you'd think they'd have... developed FTL and rescued em
<drfsupercenter> 03that's about the only one
<drfsupercenter> 03is swapnote
<DeathStar> Kencolt: huh you called?
<Ghosties> 04HUMANS
<drfsupercenter> 03everything else is the same shovelware DSi had
<Sumica> 00,10You will see when i show Die buster
<Polydunami> Where!?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: to keep it from getting sucked into the black hole.
<drfsupercenter> 03in fact, go to the 3DS store, go to new apps, it's like DSiware
<drfsupercenter> 03everywhere
<Ghosties> 04I must leave you for a wee bit so my computer can cool down
<geeky-brony> ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Doesn't make sense.
<BlueFlare> 02they do have really good demos :P
<otakon> hen3ry: they DID have that, but they don't even KNOW if they survived.
<Ghosties> 04So see you guys until later
<Aurora> 6what /is/ swapnote
<XAX> Ghosties :3
<Midnight_Tempest> in Diebuster humans couldnt leave the Sol System cause of what that black hole did

<Polydunami> See you Ghosties ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like pictochat but you can send to people over wi-fi
<Ghosties> 04Later
<drfsupercenter> 03or rather, what pictochat should have been
<geeky-brony> Ghosties
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But, heck, a black hole eating the galaxy's core doesn't since a super-massive one exists already.

*StupidSexyCJ takes ALL the cakes
<Polydunami> Whoa, didn't mean to receive cake, there
<Kandarihu> It's just a matter of willing suspension of disbelief. I won't deny that it takes more than watching western content. But it's far more rewarding.

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> mario_pony: http://greyshaa.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5155y8
<VioletGreySha> do what ever you like xD
<Vordox> VioletGreySha: Wait, is this a coop work with Wrek?
<VioletGreySha> not really
<Vordox> He's drawing somethin similiar
<Vordox> Alright, CRITICAL EYE ACTIVATE
<mario_pony> ooohh

<mario_pony> Bitches love giant robots
<MahBoi777> lol
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> http://greyshaa.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d51i4gp is Ninjazz
<Vordox> The snout is a bit skewed, it looks to be somewhat of too long down on the face compared to the circular face, The arms aren't as stubby ast the show itself, the joints of the forelegs are too bendy to be compared to the real ponies..
<Vordox> Let's see....
<Vordox> Good points
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Vordox: which pic?
<mario_pony> wow that is a long horn
<MahBoi777> whoa
<VioletGreySha> i like long horns
<VioletGreySha> XD
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Vordox: lol who cares about those things
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol VioletGreySha
<Hogia|Animation> 12._.
<MahBoi777> hmmmmm
<mario_pony> i don't get it .-.
<Vordox> The legs are a wonderful piece of art, The hoofs, although abit too small as the arms, keeps their volume as they bend and it looks quite nice, The cold steeled weapon actually has a nice colour balance with design choices to not stick out from the pony.
<Vordox> Phew
<Vordox> CRITICAL EYE INACTIVATE
<mario_pony> somepony explain it to me
<MahBoi777> SO MUCH ART TALK
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane pokes Vordox u iz so siri

*Alicorn_Prince_Shane is DEFS afk now

<XAX> Ghosties: Got any amazing advice to help TheRainbowDash during finals? :3
<TheRainbowDash> XAX: My only tip for myself....don't fuck up.
<XAX> True...
<Ghosties> 04Advice?
<Ghosties> 04Hmm
<Ghosties> 04Make sure she gets creative when she studies
<Ghosties> 04Or he
<Ghosties> 04Or it
<RainbowAsh> Hi TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> Hello RainbowAsh!
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: Or it?.....hmm.
<Ghosties> 04If TRD is an "it" then why in the world you are studying for finals, you shouldn't even be sentient
<RainbowAsh> TheRainbowDash, good luck with your finals. I am sure you're going to do great. *hugs*
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma hide here
<Ghosties> 04But if you are a homosapien, then get creative
<TheRainbowDash> Creative then....
<Ghosties> 04Use paint and paper and stars and spoons and bricks and saws
<Ghosties> 04Don't forget colors
<Ghosties> 04Just not green
<Ghosties> 04Because green
<Ghosties> 04Is not a creative color
<XAX> RaveBrony :3
<Ghosties> 04So then take your purple brick saw and apply directly to the material you're studying
<VioletGreySha> use violet its always a awsoem color :D
<Ghosties> 04Once applied, sacrifice a small marsupial to Wal-Mart
<TheRainbowDash> Whatever you say Ghost...:D
<Ghosties> 04But makes sure it's from Australia!
<RaveBrony> Turned on my and saw "Phase4 is playing TF2" :D Glad to see its being streamed!! <3 :)
<XAX> Phase4 could provide you with that.
<RaveBrony> and hiya XAX! :$
<Ghosties> 04Don't get fooled into believing what those damn marketers on those late night programs say, they are NOT 100% Australian
<RaveBrony> :D
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: ....this is not advice at all anymore.:D
<VioletGreySha> xD
<Ghosties> 04Well fine
<Ghosties> 04If you don't want my advice
<Ghosties> 04Then I'll just go home
*Ghosties moves an inch away from his desk
<Ghosties> 04There

<TheRainbowDash> Ahh, got to go take a shower right now everypony. Be right back in 15 minutes, and then be on for 10 more minutes, and then I am heading off to school for finals.
<WallDives> I has the playtest kit.
<Life_Essence> cya TheRainbowDash
<Ghosties> 04<CrazyCherry> How do you get picked off? <-- Picked off? You know, like "Oh shit, that guy got picked off!" or "I picked that guy off with just one bullet" To eliminate, subtract, or otherwise take away from
<dishwasher_EXTREME> wtf?
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: Yeah, you know, like shot in the face.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> do you believe in ghost
<Life_Essence> doesn't need to be the face
<Life_Essence> groin is equally as valid
<Life_Essence> or...
<Life_Essence> the knee
*Life_Essence ducks
<XAX> ^no
<TheRainbowDash> Nah, I rather kill them then let them suffer....and no, never the knee.
<Life_Essence> I've killed people by shooting the soled of their shoes
<Life_Essence> OH America's Army
*XAX_ 's iPod touch is currently playing the Song Friendship from Aviators ··[ Position: 04:32/05:04 · Album: · TrackNr: 0 · Genre: Unknown ]··
<XAX_> oh my...
<TheRainbowDash> XAX_: Huh?
<WallDives> the sound of a knee breaking...
<WallDives> makes a nice SNAP sound.
<TheRainbowDash> Nevermind that, be right back everypony from my shower, and umm, XAX, you want to join me....:D
<XAX> TheRainbowDash: Lol, it's some silly command one of the IRC clients I have on my iPod. It tells the chat the details of the song I'm listening to >)
<XAX> >_>
<Ghosties> 04* XAX_ 's iPod touch is currently playing the Song Friendship from Aviators ··[ Position: 04:32/05:04 · Album: · TrackNr: 0 · Genre: Unknown ]·· <-- da fuq is this?
<WallDives> lol
<XAX> Ghosties: ^above
<Ghosties> 04Is that really necessary, XAX -_-
<dishwasher_EXTREME> yadadadadada
<XAX> Ghosties: ...probably not.
<Ghosties> 04Because I can see this becoming a distraction and possibly spam
<dishwasher_EXTREME> so......
<Life_Essence> I'm playing The Spirit Engine Music
<XAX> Ghosties: I kind of have to type the command for it to pop up in chat. It was just me being silly, and I wont do it again if you don't want me to.
<Life_Essence> SO AWESOME :O
<dishwasher_EXTREME> EPIC
<Ghosties> 04Just don't overdo it
*XAX is listening to Winter Dance Up by SimGretina.
<XAX> There we go. The shorter version...
<Life_Essence> but i wanted to know exaclty what position in the song you were in
<Life_Essence> it's important info
<XAX> Life_Essence: :(
<XAX> Ikr?
<Ghosties> 04That looks a lot better
<Ghosties> 04But again, don't overdo it. Some mods may find it spamming, just be careful
<XAX> I won't :3
<XAX> Not like many care what some rand on the net is listening to anyway, so no point.
<Ghosties> 04Maybe
<WallDives> but we care! (kindanotreally)
<Life_Essence> that depends what you're listening to
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, that too
<Life_Essence> I would give a shout out if it was something I liked
<Life_Essence> past that I'll ignore it
<Ghosties> 04Because I'll be honest if you said you were listening to a group I really like I'd be surprised :P
<Ghosties> 04No offense or anything
<Life_Essence> I'm pretty sure you'd get some comments if you were listening to La Mer by Nine Inch Nails or something
<XAX> Well i mostly listen to "popular" pony music >.>
<WallDives> brb, coffee.
<Ghosties> 04>La Mer
<Ghosties> 04>NIN
<Ghosties> 04See
<Ghosties> 04Life_Essence knows what I'm talking about
<Ghosties> 04He picks one of the very best songs from The Fragile
<Ghosties> 04He must know
<Ghosties> 04That I love NIN
<Life_Essence> XD
<XAX> ._.
<Ghosties> 04Score one for Life_Essence
<Life_Essence> I was gonna say The Great Below cause I love that song but La Mer is more out there
<Ghosties> 04The Great Below is okay
<Ghosties> 04La Mer is better IMO
<CrazyCherry> Hiya again.

<XAX> Kammerjunk :3
<Life_Essence> or more appropriately for a test Head Down - NIN
<Kammerjunk> No one in the world ever gets what they want and that is beautiful. Everybody dies frustrated and sad and that is beautiful.
<Phase4> 00,02imho gimp > photoshop
<Phase4> 00,02for one thing is 74MB
<XAX> Suddenly, inspirational words
<Phase4> 00,02photoshop is GIGABYTES
<Chimera> Sky :3!
<WallDives> Kammerjunk: lies, if I can die either saving a life, or screwing someone out of theirs, I will die happy.
<Chimera> Hihihi~
<XAX> Phase4: And it doesent cost a billion dollars
<Phase4> 00,02^
<RainbowAsh> Kammerjunk, if you find it beautiful, isn't that in a way what you want? And you will probably get that, so...
<Life_Essence> I always wonder how many people who use Photoshop actually bought it
<Kammerjunk> RainbowAsh: My mind!
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha ha. Paying for Photoshop.
<Life_Essence> outside of professionals
<HyperMetalLugia> ai chimera
<HyperMetalLugia> ;
<Chimera> Hmllllll :3
<dishwasher_EXTREME> yyahooo!!!
<Life_Essence> though Photoshop has nothing on the licenses for the software i use for work
<Life_Essence> $10000 for one
<XAX> I downloaded Photoshop elements 7 when I was in like... Year 8
<Drake> 04ohai HML
<dishwasher_EXTREME> photoshop?
<Chimera> Drakeh
<WallDives> photochop.
<Drake> 04ohai Chime
<Kammerjunk> IIRC, 3D modelling software costs more than Photoshop.
<XAX> Does this man not know what Photoshop is?
<Kammerjunk> Photocop. It's sort of like Timecop.
<Life_Essence> Blender doesn't :P
<dishwasher_EXTREME> wth
<Kammerjunk> I meant stuff like 3DSMax.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: And that costs...?
<Life_Essence> I wouldn't think they;d be too far off each other
<RainbowAsh> Life_Essence, freeware ftw, but sometimes you need a feature that is such a pain in the flank to code that you have to pay someone to do it
<Skydroid> So many greetings
<Chimera> We luv echothr
<Chimera> XP
<dishwasher_EXTREME> nyan
<Life_Essence> oh, Autodesk make 3DSMax
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Life_Essence> I remember using Autosketch way back in 95
<Life_Essence> Oh ye olde days of computering
<Skydroid> Manly looove
<Noir> Let me guess this is one of thous matches wher one team are objecvts hideing in the stage? the problem with thous stages is that after a few matches on the same match the static objects rarely get moved around so, some one who knows the lay out like the back of the hoove would see the hiders quickly. Also some hiders hide outside of the bounderys of the stage.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ? idk
<Life_Essence> Prophunt i think it's called
<WallDives> WAAAAAAAAALL! But yes.
<XAX> Prop hunt on CSS
<Twi_Fi> I come back to get smacked with a wall of text.
<XAX> no
<WallDives> Twi_Fi: ikr?
<VioletGreySha> hrhr hay Twi_Fi
<XAX> Prop hunt on GMOD
<Life_Essence> 3DSMAx is anywhere from ~$100 for student version up to $3495
<XAX> SO MUCH FUN
<dishwasher_EXTREME> tf 2 is madness
<Twi_Fi> Hello
<Kammerjunk> XAX: Well, 3ds Max costs around $5500-6500.
<Life_Essence> you're getting ripped off XD
<Life_Essence> http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/how-to-buy/
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait. I'm on the suites page.
<Chimera> Hi SL
<Kammerjunk> But still, that's $3500.
<XAX> Kammerjunk: HORY SHET
<dishwasher_EXTREME> gimme
<Phase4> 00,02does it accept gif images or just tga?
<Kammerjunk> Photoshop is what, 700 dollars?
<Phase4> 00,023.5k
<WallDives> HA!
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, its easier to learn blender
<Noir> Match started.
<Life_Essence> it's always easier to learn blender
<XAX> Phase4: Never tried with a gif
<Life_Essence> just takes time
<Life_Essence> ...a LOT of time
<Kammerjunk> Says 700 here, but I might just be doing it wrong again.
<Shiny_Latias> Hello :3
<Life_Essence> I think you're about right
<Life_Essence> on it's own
<dishwasher_EXTREME> what the hell
<Twi_Fi> :O
<Noir> Hmmm, i wonder if i can join in on the server?
<Twi_Fi> :O:O
<VioletGreySha> yah Noir
<VioletGreySha> do it
<Twi_Fi> :O:O:O
<Life_Essence> of course then you couple 3DSMax with a Workstation + Renderfarm and you're looking WAY WAY more than photoshop
<dishwasher_EXTREME> jesie creezy
<Kammerjunk> This song sure is neat.
<VioletGreySha> server ip is 69.162.110.91:27018
<Life_Essence> Server Raid

<Life_Essence> they just end up hurting my ears

<Life_Essence> I'll never understand why the slide was my most loved ride :/
<VioletGreySha> xD
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hehe, I love making holes on the ground, fill them with water, and put in them some peeps
<Life_Essence> it was like $20 for one slide down it
<Life_Essence> and people where still lining up for miles
<Life_Essence> it boggled my mind
<Spell-of-Gaming> Life_Essence: wut

<Life_Essence> I don't think so

<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm planning to get Chimera Hunt once I buy Garry's Mod.
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Spell-of-Gaming> I heard RCT3D was a disappointment
<VioletGreySha> Spell-of-Gaming: yah it wasnt so good
<Life_Essence> The Claustrophobia and Agoraphobia are my 2 favourite rollercoasters
<Ghosties> 04Guys, by the way, I don't know if you've heard from Val but don't forget that he wants all of you guys to send our beloved mod Luna users from all of BronyState, telling her just how much we appreciate her and all the hard work she does for us. If you haven't written a letter for her yet by all means do so but REMEMBER, AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, *DO NOT TELL LUNA ABOUT THIS!!!!*
<Ghosties> 4It is imperative it remain a surprise for her ;) When you are finished with your letters send them to valthejean@gmail.com. Thanks you guys, hope to see many letters from you guys :D
<Life_Essence> but everytime I tried to make them no one would go on them
<VioletGreySha> Dat wall
<Ghosties> 04*beloved mod Luna letters from all of BronyState users
<Lil_B> I wrote an Haiku, because I didn't really know that to write
<Spell-of-Gaming> The huge spiders on the RCT3 Wild Expansion are scary as hell.
<Lil_B> about that she is impotatant to us
<Shiny_Latias> cartoning?
<Ghosties> 04Just tell her how much she means to you, if she does that is. The BronyState team would really appreciate it, guys :)
<Phase4> 00,02i'm feeling that its time for another game
<Spell-of-Gaming> ANOTHER GAME
<Phase4> 00,02allso do not tell luna
<Phase4> 00,02I WILL DESTROY YOU SHOULD YOU TELL LUNA

<Spell-of-Gaming> My chat derps when I scroll up.
<VioletGreySha> valthejean@gmail.com
<VioletGreySha> :)
<WallDives> quiet.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ah, thank you.
<VioletGreySha> np
<VioletGreySha> yah its very quiet today
<Lil_B> rablerablerable
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm planning to make it on our iPad, since I'm almost there everytime I'm not at the computer. :P
<VioletGreySha> ^^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Apple should really allow Flash on Safari.
<Lil_B> Spell-of-Gaming the problem is that apple really doesn't like flash
<Phase4> 00,02"The one thing you can't do is create too many frames--due to the Source engine's 120KB"
<Phase4> 00,02my spray is 256k
<Phase4> 00,02that sucks
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm really mad at Apple for not allowing Flash and making the SDK for apps on iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad available only for the Mac. :I
<Lil_B> and the is a good thing, Flash is really insecure and has o lot of flaws (at least the Video playing part for you internet Videos) thats why so many people really want to see HTML5 completed and implemented soon
<Spell-of-Gaming> To be honest, HTML5 isn't really going to go far if Flash keeps getting in the way.
<Lil_B> Spell-of-Gaming true, unfortunatly :/ but Youtube already has an HTML5 test that you can eneable
<Phase4> 00,02this thing dont like my gif
<Phase4> 00,02this gif has 80 frames
<VioletGreySha> yah
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wat
<Spell-of-Gaming> Coincidentally, "Apple Store Down" is trending on Twitter.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Also, why are people debating which is better? Twitter or YouTube? They have both different concepts.

<WallDives> Vordox, I was, for racial issues...
<Vordox> I just had a hunch that FiM really turns out towards those who don't follow the spectrum that the world has given us.
<Vordox> =<
<Vordox> And who knows that friendship is the thing that is proof of us living.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Nico Nico Douga is probably one of the best things the internet hat to offer
<WallDives> also, is that Applejacks FiM theme?
<Lil_B> Vordox I was a guy who got picked on often, but it never came so far that i would have ever called it bulliing, there were just some jerks

<Sylandest1> Airpuff: are you ok? what happened?
*alexxm hugs Airpuff
<Airpuff> alexxm: had physics exam today.. didnt go to well :'(
<Sylandest1> CrimsonPhoenix: it will be curious to see for sure
<|Discord|> Best remix ever
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Then I guess RD's mother will be based on Firefly.
<CrazyCherry> I CAN'T REPLY MY FRIEND ON YOUTUBE!!!! WHY SO MANY ERRORS!?!?!?!?!?!?!? :[
<Meanwhile> CrazyCherry: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3219/

<Phase4> 00,02|Discord|, 01:38
<Petrified_Discord> I like the "Shim Sham" version for the main reason that the name of the machine changes to nothing but "S's" (Shim Sham Sister Super Speedy Cider Squeezer 6000)
<Phase4> 00,02not bad though
<|Discord|> Phase4: Dude...you stay up to late
