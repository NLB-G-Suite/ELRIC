<DSNesmith> watched the first ten minutes
<Everlasting_Joy> Needs more Nurse Roberts.
<Obsidian> He is so dead
<DSNesmith> skipped half an hour in
<DSNesmith> watched ten minutes
<WindWhistler|AFK> If they're really recent and bad, expect RiffTrax
<DSNesmith> dozed off
<RosePetal> Some moveis need to be riffed or mst3k.
<WindWhistler|AFK> Or if they're critically acclaimed like Harry Potter and LoTR
<DSNesmith> woke up and watched random snippets toward the end
<Spazturtle> lol

<Ghosties> 04Shia Lebouf, get the fuck out of the movie
<DSNesmith> nononononono
<Reikim> This is seriously badness taken to an art.
<Pale_Horse> How come a movie about Korean legends and Korean dragons only has any actual Koreans as side characters? :|
<RosePetal> What is with that ugly sweater.
<poniesrock> how much longer is the movie
<AlienWarhead> Lets do it on her bed
<Ghosties> 04Kissing is not allowed

<desertman2> why did they kill her?
<OohShiny> really? no blood?
<DSNesmith> because....

<DSNesmith> no, no reason
<Reikim> The perfect blend of shitty acting, shitty writing, and shitty CGI, but not too shitty because then it would be hilarious.
<Polydunami> dat charlie the unicorn reference xD
<DSNesmith> nothing in this movie makes a lick of sense
<pony_300> but seriously why is the love interest being hounded by Orochimaru in her nightmares?
<RosePetal> She's ded. There's no way he chewed her.

<AlienWarhead> Pony songs get into your brain better than gummi bears
<Deadlypon3> The Die Hard movie was fine :I
<RosePetal> I think he means the sequels.

<TWarTovlerWars> that last Die Hard was tepid
<Midnight_Fyre> :D
<RosePetal> Now we have to drag you away.

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Where is John Conner?
<Pale_Horse> Isn't he just a reporter? where does he get the authority to cross crime scene lines?
<Ghosties> 04She went to the hospital and the movie threw her around so much it fucked her up
<RosePetal> So the husband is ded too.

<Quick_Thinker> no visitors
<Reikim> And anyway, I'm pretty sure most of this isn't Korean. It takes place in the US, for starters. It features crappy US movie clich√©s.

<Pale_Horse> How come white folks can't have working magic to call upon when stuff like this happens? :(
<Klumzeedragon> We need more cars!
<DSNesmith> I wasn't kidding
<Dark92Enigma> Ghosties: i'm back what did i miss?
<otakon> it's a FFXIII reject!
<Deadlypon3> ._.
<DSNesmith> the protag never changes expression
<RosePetal> Hello random woman we don't know.
<pony_300> Dawdler. Yea I'd be pretty pissed if I was named that too.
<Quick_Thinker> and what happens if they hit them with a tank
<Reikim> This is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen.
<MrBen> ...oh, don't tell me.
<XaviortheSavior> spy!
<MrBen> He was.
<RosePetal> SO black guy is ded.
<Ghosties> 04Suddenly, day time
<wirisme1989> i'm still laughing
<Quick_Thinker> insta kill
<Obsidian> Again?
<Reikim> I would watch High School Musical over this.
<DSNesmith> "I'm sure he's fine"
<TWarTovlerWars> uh‚Ä¶ that means‚Ä¶ something...
<desertman2> They really need to spycheck
<Ghosties> 04You missed a bunch of bad editing and segues, Dark92
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: I guess someone played the Sun Song.
*Meanwhile at the beach.
<RosePetal> lol That's my trait.
<Sumica> 00,10she never asked for this
<MrBen> So did I lose the bet?
<DSNesmith> "I didn't ask for this role"
<Reikim> When did they get to the beach?!
<Deadlypon3> Well, now there on a beach
<Ghosties> 04>Meanwhile
<DSNesmith> "I wanted to be an extra"
<RAWRity> High School Musicl at least has laughably awful musical numbers
<Ghosties> 04OH U
<Dark92Enigma> Cause repoters don't think, right?
<OohShiny> damn, they fast
<RosePetal> I wonder what happens to the zookeeper.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Welcome back!
<Rex_Mundi> Imagine...imagine... if the bad guys gets hit by a car a 3rd time in this movie?
<Meanwhile> Bra cast?
<Dark92Enigma> reporters*
<Meanwhile> Bra cast.
<richfiles> I am actually eating Larry The Cable Guy Mac and Cheese... :O
<Deadlypon3> RosePetal I wonder what happened to my sandwich
<Meanwhile> She said Bra cast.
<RosePetal> lol he gets hit 3 times by a car.
<DSNesmith> "all these horrible creatures in my head, and stuff"
<fluttercry> 05,15When DID they get to the beach? Reikim brings up a good poin
<MrBen> ...what was I even betting, anyway?
<Klumzeedragon> She didnt put all those apples in her bag either I presume Sumica.
<DSNesmith> she sounds so, so bored
<TWarTovlerWars> So, I guess they love each other?
<RosePetal> In my head~
<pony_300> being chased by some mysterious super creature? GO take a walk on the beach FUCK LAYING LOW
*Dark92Enigma hugs AJIsAwesome
<Rookeealding> it's large
<AlienWarhead> Should we call the Wesker guy something else instead of Wesker?
<Reikim> Not even a Rifftrax can save this, but then, I don't really enjoy Rifftrax anyway.
<RosePetal> Yeah they is the love interest.
<Marx> Rex_Mundi, Can you do that? Can you get run over thrice?
<Meanwhile> Wait, is that the guy from Dexter?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: WHAT did i miss?
<Deadlypon3> AlienWarhead Alex WeskeR?
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile MANDARK?
<Reikim> How long has nothing been happening for noe?
<Reikim> *now?
<Deadlypon3> OH GOD
<Deadlypon3> THAT WOMAN
<RosePetal> Oh my gosh president. The snake attacked people but nobody saw him?1
<DSNesmith> the problem with rifftrax is that they do all kinds of movies, not just really bad ones
<Meanwhile> Dark92Enigma: No I meant Dexter the serial killer not Dexter with the lab.
<Dark92Enigma> HAHAHA-HAHAHAHA
<Deadlypon3> WHERE HAVE I SEEN HER FROM!?
<Obsidian> Foreign? Really?
<Ghosties> 04We should call the wesker guy the villain from that one movie that was MST'd...which I can't recall ><
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Cheesy scenes and this: http://duloph.com/images%5CDragon%20Wars%5Cfence.gif
<RAWRity> dunno Reikim, how long's the movie been on?
<TWarTovlerWars> What do you know, Mr. Scientist!?
<Reikim> Nah, Rifftrax just isn't my kind of humour.
<Deadlypon3> GHosties Calgon?
<RosePetal> lOL somebody gifted it!
<Pale_Horse> Seriously. Koreans get actual dragons and evil demons to throw at us, but we don't even get a couple of Biblical angels or something to even the odds? :|
<Reikim> Too many references.
<Ghosties> 04Was it Calgon?
<DSNesmith> ah.
<AlienWarhead> Ghostie Space Mutiny
<Ghosties> 04Oh
<Ghosties> 04No
<Ghosties> 04There's another guy I'm thinking of
<TWarTovlerWars> Calgon takes you away
<DSNesmith> MST3K is definitely esoteric
<Reikim> Too many random replacements of lines.
<RosePetal> This is where the fish live.
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties The devil?
<Meanwhile> Washing machines live longer with Calgon~
<Midnight_Fyre> I want to see the trenchcoat guy get hit by a car again
<Reikim> It doesn't feel linked to the movie.
<Sumica> 00,10can we just toss them in the ocean again?
<DSNesmith> their twilight one
<DSNesmith> was hilarious
<Ghosties> 04"What if I learned how to act?"
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile: oh. Not the Michael C. Hall himself, but another character from the series?
<DSNesmith> "line"
<DSNesmith> "line"
<Reikim> Now, if they spent their time making fun of how bad it actually is, then that would work for me.
<RosePetal> lol Guy gets hit by a car while playing unfitting music.
<DSNesmith> "LIIIIINE"
<Obsidian> Ghosties: Kalgan
<XaviortheSavior> kiss! kiss!
<Reikim> See, that would be fine.

<Sergio_Scriptor> WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT ?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yay MLP :D
<Reikim> Still feels like they do it on the spot.
<Dark92Enigma> THEY REFERENCED MLP
<DSNesmith> lol@ main chat
<XaviortheSavior> wmc? What's that stand for?
<Everlasting_Joy> This was clearly before G4.
<RosePetal> My body was not ready!
<Sumica> 00,10lolwut
<Polydunami> Wait, they said My Little Pony?
<otakon> bullet proof shields?
<Ghosties> 04God, this movie

<Rex_Mundi> This was before FIM
<Ghosties> 04WHAT
<BonyHepSits> HE SAID MY LITTLE PONY NOW WE MUST SCREAM LIKE EXITED LITTLE FANGIRLS
<otakon> BULLSHIT
<Ghosties> 04WHAT?!?!?!
<Reikim> What crap are they getting up to this time?
<Meanwhile> Ghosties: Why would it anyway? That old lady walking into a fence clears up all problems with everything.
<Dark_Horst> say, how old is this rifftrax?
<Jigglysaint> but did they reference the right MLP?
<TWarTovlerWars> World Maid Center
<twilight_sprinkle> of course they referenced it, its what they do to fill up time.
<desertman2> Such a weak generic army
<CCCP> lol
<Nicos> oh yeeah, every bulllet hits the shields
<Ghosties> 04WHAT THE FUCK????!!!!!
<Pale_Horse> I'm just honored our fandom was mentioned by Mike and the boys. :)
<MrBen> Xsvior: Worst Movie Clause
<RosePetal> Wait, that's not a dragon, that's a snake.
<Deadlypon3> ...
<AlienWarhead> I knew this Rifftrax was a good idea
<DSNesmith> the pony reference
<otakon> Ghosties: you love this but you hate Over the Hedge...
<DSNesmith> it exploded
<Deadlypon3> WHATS GOING ON!?
*NocturnalBlade fangirl screem
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow you guys
<Rookeealding> bill murry?
<pony_300> So either the villain is Kyo Kusanagi, or Nappa.
<Jigglysaint> riftrax mentions MLP on a MLP fan stream
<Barbetos> Why did they even say anything about MLP exactly??
<Ghosties> 04Because this movie isn't offensive or tasteless
<DSNesmith> man those marines had shit micro
<Deadlypon3> Pale_Horse this was before MLP Generation 4 ^^'
<Barbetos> I was not paying attention.
<RosePetal> Random person.
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Do you know when this rifftrax was made?
<CrimsonPhoenix> they ment BEFORE FiM
<XaviortheSavior> MrBen uuuuuhhhh what's that mean? :P
<Reikim> I still don't get why everyone thinks Rifftrax are so great.
*Dark92Enigma SQUEE
<Pale_Horse> Oh. :(
<Reikim> I just don't see it.
<desertman2> I can't keep track of where the bad guy is now
<RosePetal> Clear your mind what do you see?
<AlienWarhead> Ghosties>_>
<Ghosties> 04...well...it could be offensive if you were a dragon enthusiast
<DSNesmith> babes in toyland wasn't offensive or tasteless, it was just four fucking hours long and boring as all hell
<RosePetal> SLEEP!
<AlienWarhead> Deeper Deeper
<TWarTovlerWars> The editting during the hospital scene was extremely offensive.
<RAWRity> btw, I hope that, for S3, somebody will be recording the chat for each new episode. In case something like Derpy happens again.
<Sumica> 00,10some time between 2007 and now AJIsAwesome
<RosePetal> Dig a little Deeper.
<AJIsAwesome> WE MUST GO DEEPER.
<MrBen> Xavior: A movie deemed to be so bad and so unwatchable that it is never, ever shown on BronyState again.
<DSNesmith> flashbaaaaack
<Klumzeedragon> Dhosties: Like me?
<Reikim> Hell yes
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Ok, thank you.
<Dark92Enigma> we MUST GO DERPER
<Obsidian> Ghosties: And yet technically we have yet to see a dragon
<AlienWarhead> throw her into the water
<Reikim> That video actually led me here.
<DSNesmith> oh I remember that
<RosePetal> I see a kid and my daddy throwing me into the water.
<Quick_Thinker> god father
<DSNesmith> I missed that day
<Quick_Thinker> yes
<Ghosties> 04Haha, true
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties*** Like me?
<fluttercry> 05,15dat Godfather
<Dark_Horst> Ghosties: i'm not even an enthusiast, and it offends me
<DSNesmith> watched episode
<Rex_Mundi> 2007, so it was G3 ponies when this movie was made.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT ACTING
<RosePetal> Then I became Batman.
<Dark92Enigma> I SEE....DEAD....PONIES.
<DSNesmith> was like
<XaviortheSavior> We need to go deeper!
<Dark_Horst> Ghosties: this movie is plain bad
<Pale_Horse> Everybody's dead Dave. :(
<DSNesmith> "hublurblghwah!"
<RosePetal> I wonder what else she's seeing.
<Sumica> 00,10so she can remember this?
<MrBen> Xavior: Under the current clause, if we see a movie, it is eliglbe to be seen again after six months have passed, unless it gets WMC'd.
<AlienWarhead> I see koreans
<fluttercry> 05,15That chat explosion was
<RosePetal> She saw Bambi's mom get shot.
<fluttercry> 05,15hell
<DSNesmith> lol
<DSNesmith> poor AJ
<AlienWarhead> I see Ponies
<Dark92Enigma> Ok.....RIFFTRAX/MST3K referenced MLP! This was epic
<Obsidian> dem old fashion rocket launchers
<DSNesmith> her focus episode got completely derailed before the titles
<RAWRity> I woke up late that day, and got spoiled by the EQD post where it just showed a picture of Derpy and said "Oh My God."
<fluttercry> 05,15"Why can't I hold all these kicks!"
<Dark_Horst> GLOWY SHIT
<Quick_Thinker> movie is full of suck
<Rex_Mundi> Hwachas
<DSNesmith> yeah same RAWRity
<Deadlypon3> SO we can't have asian lovers but white lovers? OH YEAH
<Meanwhile> The power of Christ compels you!
<Everlasting_Joy> Suddenly, Exorcist.
<AJIsAwesome> What kind of acting was that?!:D
<MrBen> Suddenly, Ghostbusters scene. Only not.
<DSNesmith> I was like "okay must watch immediately"
<BonyHepSits> We should stream Hercules the Legendary Journeys sometime
<Sumica> 00,10so do you think she can understand the foren lauange she spoke in her past lafe?
<Dark92Enigma> Previously on DragonBallZ: KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAROOOOOOOOOOT
<Quick_Thinker> the power of celestia compels you
<pony_300> hey main character? little emotion please? No? okay then.
<RosePetal> Love how the man has no emotion or shock of this.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I woke up late for the Derpy thing
<Meanwhile> Zffazanna?
<Elit3xPon3> hey guys im back
<MrBen> Everlasting_Joy: Much better reference.
<RosePetal> THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so when I jumped on
<SaxyPretender> 0,14first thing I saw was OMG SHE TALKED
<Dark92Enigma> IS this movier turned into the EXORCIST?
<DSNesmith> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Elit3xPon3: Welcome back!
<MrBen> No, you'll just die.
<Rookeealding> so... no following giant snake
<Reikim> The funniest thing: Last Roundup was actually a pretty good character episode for AJ.
<pony_300> Keanu Reeves is not a good actor to mimic
<Pale_Horse> That's totally normal. Happens all the time during hypnotism. :P
<otakon> GET THE TANKS!
<RosePetal> Again nobody sees the snake.
<AlienWarhead> We can totally out run it!
<Obsidian> So...that was pointless
<DSNesmith> I quite liked it
<Sumica> 00,10so um, how is this snake able to just show up?
<TWarTovlerWars> "old man, get out there!" not gonna way that?
<DSNesmith> had great gags, great animation
<Elit3xPon3> dragons!
<RosePetal> Guys You left him to die!
<DSNesmith> >that ILL reference
<Uniison> magic
<fluttercry> 05,15Reikim but Derpy stole that. Nobody paid attention to the rest of the episode
<TWarTovlerWars> *say*
<Obsidian> and ded
<Reikim> I know, right?
<RosePetal> DED.
<RAWRity> yeah, just a shame it got completely overshadowed by the Derpy controversy.
<Reikim> Kind of sad.
<Meanwhile> Dude where's my snake.
<Deadlypon3> Pizza guy is best pizza guy :p
<RosePetal> notded.
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica the same way Godzilla shows up+
<RosePetal> Poor Pizza Guy.
<Sumica> 00,10he lives!
<DSNesmith> and people have the nerve to call her a background pony
<RAWRity> to the point where people now actively HATE the episode over the editting and whatnot.
<Meanwhile> Your muffler's dragon. Dohoho.
<Rookeealding> Hey he ain't dead?
<XaviortheSavior> he's not ded?!
<AJIsAwesome> Pizza Guy is best pony.
<DSNesmith> rarity's my fave, but I post as AJ
<Elit3xPon3> is that a dragon or a snake?
<Reikim> Poor AJ, always shafted by the fandom.
<MrBen> I didn't lose the bet at all!
<Dark92Enigma> WE need a FISH TRAP
<Obsidian> Wait wy did it stop
<BonyHepSits> another office reference
<Spectrum_Rush> called it
<RosePetal> lol This is the worst town ever.
<Deadlypon3> Oh yeah....HES FROM THE OFFICE
<TWarTovlerWars> seriously, you didn't tell him to get out of that house‚Ä¶ WMC/10
<DSNesmith> poor girl needs more fans
<RosePetal> HE'S NOT DED.
<BonyHepSits> *dat another office reference
<MLP_Brovakiin> I still want the angry homeless guy to make a comeback :D
<moobull69> Pizza pony!
<RosePetal> HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!
<desertman2> a "dragon"
*RAWRity demands 3 AJ episodes in S3
<pony_300> DARREL WILL LIVE
<Midnight_Fyre> You'd think with all the surveillence we have these days the authorities would know where it is at all times . . . unless . . . The government is in on it! It's a conspiracy!
<DSNesmith> "it's headed south right now, SIGH"
<Obsidian> Elit3xPon3: Technically its not a dragon ...yet
<DSNesmith> "it's heading south right now, SIGH"
<Dark92Enigma> WE NEED.........A LOTTA FISH
*BonyHepSits demands 1/2 an AJ episode for S3
<RAWRity> because fuck, if Rainbow Dash can get 3, let AJ get some. and a song.
<Elit3xPon3> yet? dun dunn dunnnn
<DSNesmith> oh god
<DSNesmith> godzilla
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm thinking about the actors behind sadly horrible movies like this
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: DOn't worry. He's the main hero. He'll save the day at the end.
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark92Enigma: :).
<Spazturtle> Midnight_Fyre: The gov would know where is was
<DSNesmith> screw that movie
<Reikim> One of the problems, though - as I've stated - is that one of the reasons I love AJ is why she's hard to write for.
<RosePetal> Hey thanks for leaving me out on the cold street with a dragon on the loose. *sarcastic*
<Reikim> She's down to earth.
<Reikim> She's sensible.
<Meanwhile> She loves apples.
<Reikim> She's not insane.
<Pale_Horse> This movie would be a lot more awesome if it was the black guy that was the reincarned destined one. :D
<DSNesmith> she loves Apples
<Reikim> Also she loves apples.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> like they look at themself asking; why in the heck am I in here?
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Yay
*DSNesmith sniggers
<fluttercry> 05,15black guy is dead. calling it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh
<RAWRity> there's PLENTY you can do with AJ's character. Especially considering she's the only one really close to her family.
<Midnight_Fyre> And of course, there is no major traffic jam as hundreds of thousands of people try to flee LA
<TWarTovlerWars> In that people, they were at least able to say "Run, It's Godzilla!"
<BonyHepSits> cough*hillbilly*cough
<Obsidian> Hey, remember that dragon that was chasing us? WHy did it stop?
<RosePetal> lol I love how the black guy only has a scratch on his head.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this is where is I first saw the movie
<AlienWarhead> So the giant snake is not the news right now?
<RosePetal> But we thought he was ded.
<DSNesmith> I do want to see more AJ/Rarity episodes
<otakon> well Windows Movie Make is WORTHLESS
<Sumica> 00,10no one in the kitchen in this restraunt
<DSNesmith> they're great foils
<Crippler> I LOVE starbursts
<otakon> it's goddamn WORTHLESS
<Obsidian> Oh wait sorry Its not a drgon
<Dark92Enigma> DSNesmith: same here, it killed the King Of Monsters, but it gave us one of the greatest memes of all time: THAT'S A LOTTA FISH
<Rookeealding> guns have not worked.. why he need gun?
<Reikim> Anyway
<Midnight_Fyre> Hey, Starburst are delicious
<RAWRity> AJ and Rarity or Aj and Pinkie. They work well together.
<RosePetal> It's just this Movie. The characters are very stupid.
<AlienWarhead> Only three bullets left
<Reikim> Derailing this now before it turns into a Worst Episode convo.
<otakon> I was trying to make a .gif of the clip of the grandma running into the wall
<Spectrum_Rush> fluttercry: betcha he lives
<pony_300> dude is EVERYWHERE
<Rookeealding> wait.. black guy was old dude?
<Rustymeat> wtf
<Obsidian> Yeah that tiny gun will help
<RAWRity> hell, let's get a duet between Rarity and AJ
<Reikim> D-Wars could have worked.
<RosePetal> What the?
<otakon> and it WON'T SAVE PROPERLY
<DSNesmith> there are no worst episodes
<Meanwhile> D-Wars had an old lady walk into a fence.
<AlienWarhead> Go to North Korea no one will look for you there
<Pale_Horse> This guy is a poor substitute for Morpheus... :|
<DSNesmith> there are just episodes one doesn't care to rewatch
<Crippler> CHIMCHIM
<CrimsonPhoenix> also Princess Canada is best Princess http://i.imgur.com/yNq8F.jpg
<Rookeealding> So is black guy really dead?
<RosePetal> That's nice dude. Do you have any emotion.
<otakon> Reikim: in it's original form it could have
<otakon> THIS mess is just ridiculous
<RosePetal> Eyeup.
<Dark92Enigma> Just like my career.....I'M. ACTING
<RAWRity> Worst MLP episode = SO Many Ways to Play
<Rookeealding> Hi mr. snake!
<DSNesmith> I think "mess" is an apt word
<otakon> and would be unwatchable without the Rifftrax
<Polydunami> CrimsonPhoenix HNNNGGGG
<Deadlypon3> I love those cream cheese packets :D
<DSNesmith> oh god rawrity
<Rex_Mundi> Luna does nothing but sleep
<RosePetal> I'm...... Acting......
<DSNesmith> that thing
<Reikim> Even with Rifftrax I'm having a hard time watching this.
<otakon> WHY DOES NO ONE PANICKING OVER GIANT SNAKE!?
<Elit3xPon3> oh sheet
<AlienWarhead> CrimsonPhoenix is there one for USA and the UK?
<DSNesmith> the dark, seedy, underbelly of flash animation

<Reikim> Bewborn Cuties is the only thing worse than this.

<AJIsAwesome> Where's the hobo when you need him?!
<Reikim> This snake is stupid.
<RosePetal> Stop! Guns not working.

<Barbetos> They would not fly that close. EVER
<Midnight_Fyre> And nobody has fired rockets at it yet
<Sumica> 00,10use the rockets
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: You promised he would ,a
<Reikim> EAT THE GIRL. BECOME A GOD. THEN GO AFTER THE CHOPPERS>
<BonyHepSits> Reikim what about BITL
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ITS RAINING SPENT SHELLS
<Rookeealding> I want the lady that ran into the fence to come back
<Ghosties> 04Zap it with your laser gun!

<DSNesmith> ded
<Reikim> BITL?
<MLP_Brovakiin> *make a comeback :(
<Midnight_Fyre> I think one well placed bunker buster would do the trick
<Dark92Enigma> AIM FOR THE HEAD!
<Ghosties> 04Hit it with your zappy gun!
<Pale_Horse> Isn't that the same building the Independence Day aliens blew up first?
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: civilians, plus close to building...nvm
<Polydunami> Oh, America
<Deadlypon3> Well that is easy
<DSNesmith> this is a pussy dragon
<AJIsAwesome> The hobo is secretly the commander of the military.:O
<desertman2> yes
<RosePetal> We need Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and KING KONG.
<RAWRity> Babes in Toyland
<Klumzeedragon> ZOWWY POW POW!
<Reikim> Haven't seen it.
<otakon> well it is certainly hurting it
<Dark92Enigma> 9/11 JOKE ABORTED
<Reikim> Thank God.
<Deadlypon3> Man, THAt WAS easy
<Rustymeat> ZOMBIE CANCER?
<Meanwhile> That movie killed people.
<DSNesmith> lol arby's
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh wow the humans weapons actually did something this time
<BonyHepSits> RAWRity do not say that name, it is forbidden
<DSNesmith> ugh
<DSNesmith> babes
<RosePetal> No jokes about the said event.
<Meanwhile> It is the worst thing that has ever been on here.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: who?
<DSNesmith> babes is the worst movie I have ever seen
<otakon> BULCOS!
<fluttercry> 05,15More dragons!
<DSNesmith> and I've seen some bad movies
<Klumzeedragon> YEAH HAH! *highfives Rustymeat*
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: My favourite GLaDOS for one.
<RosePetal> So now the snake is getting attacked by bullets.
<otakon> fluttercry: Bulcos
<Rex_Mundi> birdemic
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: just wait until I get to choose B movie...
<Reikim> See, if the movie had STARTED with a scene like this, then CONTINUED with a scene like this, it just MIGHT have been bearable.
<RosePetal> FLY MY PRETTIES FLY FLY!
<otakon> RosePetal: hight caliber bullets
<Obsidian> fluttercry: nope not dragons
<DSNesmith> now the weirdest movie we've ever seen on here
<DSNesmith> hmmmm
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<DSNesmith> I'd vote Vampire's Kiss
<otakon> FAIL PILOT
<Ghosties> 04Suddenly, MechWarrior
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: military precision. with its head in the air they can blow it right off without hurting anyone more than would be hurt anyway from the body rolling over due to other modes of killing it
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: then you all get to see...NUDIST COLONY OF THE DEAD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> mechs!
<NocturnalBlade> mechs outta know where?
<DSNesmith> I was never sure whether it was a comedy, a thriller, or a horror movie
<Meanwhile> :I
<RosePetal> Dam it sign you killed them.
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: bad movie :P
<Rookeealding> So where did our "heros" go
<Dark92Enigma> SUE THEM MY PRETTIES! SUE THEM SUE THEIR ASSES
<Meanwhile> That's a thing?
<DSNesmith> but it was hilariously creepy the entire time
<Polydunami> And now he's a six-star wanted :P
<Reikim> RAWRity: That one sounds So Bad It's Good.
<otakon> NocturnalBlade: enope, Dawdlers
<Elit3xPon3> pistols wont do shit
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: it's quite a thing. It has musical numbers.
<AlienWarhead> right behind you
<otakon> ITS A TRAP!
<XaviortheSavior> acting!
<TWarTovlerWars> dammit, I forgot the opening exposition. I have no idea what's going on
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: much more logical explanation
<DSNesmith> oh my
<Pale_Horse> Equal opportunity killing. :P
<Ghosties> 04Hot Top Gun!
<pony_300> I have to admit, gatling cannon mounted dinosaurs are pretty cool.
<DSNesmith> sounds entertaining
<Sumica> 00,10I am sure there are no people in the city at all
<Meanwhile> ...
<Meanwhile> It has musical numbers.
<otakon> and THEY are not bullet proof
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<RAWRity> Reikim: there'sa scene where a forest ranger does a rap song about people getting eaten by zombies
<Meanwhile> Oh dear.
<RosePetal> There no heroes. They are letting innocent people die. They are lettting the innocent die!
<DSNesmith> did we ever see Night of the LEpus
<Polydunami> Boom
<Everlasting_Joy> Late explosion is in poor taste.
<Rookeealding> hench the " marks
<MLP_Brovakiin> We need puff the magic dragon!
<Reikim> Fuck yes RAWRity. I am voting that for B next time, just to boost your chances.
<Rosfox> xD
<DSNesmith> or Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
<TWarTovlerWars> XD
<RosePetal> We need Spike!
<DSNesmith> that one's a classic
<Obsidian> Hey remember those two main characters? Do we even care where they are
<Rookeealding> we need ponies
<pony_300> rofl that chopper pilot's still alive
<DSNesmith> a modern B-movie
<RosePetal> Pyro.
<CCCP> i dont get this movie :s
<otakon> please
<Rookeealding> Spike would run too.
<DSNesmith> the sequel was great too
<Quick_Thinker> sounds like american announcers
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal How would you react if you had to fight dragons?
<BonyHepSits> we should watch Human Centipede
<XylemTube> OMG they mentioned airwolf
<otakon> not the Night of the Lepus
<Ghosties> 04How much money did they waste on this movie
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal: and they're feeding the dragon,.......:D......all those innocent lives...:'(....yeah, they're dicks
<otakon> wait
<RosePetal> I would be scared but I wouldnt run away.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AlienWarhead, I would send out Fluttershy
<Deadlypon3> Well
<DSNesmith> whoops
<CCCP> lol
<otakon> how come he was using a REVOLVER?
<DSNesmith> ded
<Deadlypon3> UHm...
<Quick_Thinker> ded
<Sumica> 00,10I love the pilot, leting go of the stick to cover his face
<Quick_Thinker> WAHT
<XylemTube> Ghosties: about 70 million
<otakon> FINALLY TANKS!
<Polydunami> Revolver is best pony :3
<TWarTovlerWars> They Porsche 911'd that building
<DSNesmith> lol
<Ghosties> 04All them special effects
<Deadlypon3> WHAT WAS THE POINT OF SHOWING HIM GETTING OUT IF HE DIED ANYWAY!
<Quick_Thinker> alive but then explosion killed XD
<Dark92Enigma> MICHAEL BAY WAS HERE
<Elit3xPon3> big guns
<MrBen> >Pulls out gun to shoot dragon. >Crashes into building anyway.
<fluttercry> 05,15Rifftrax is saving the hell out of this movie
<otakon> Ghosties: Micheal Bay is getting a chubby right now
<desertman2> Why are human weapons always useless?
<AlienWarhead> The dragons and miltary have a fast reaction time
<otakon> fluttercry: agreed
<Reikim> THANKS FOR THE EXPOSITION
<MrBen> >Initially survives. >Helicopter blows up two seconds later anyway.
<pony_300> otakon: And he has no idea why.
<DSNesmith> "I'm expositing right now in case some people still don't get it"
<RosePetal> Helicopter crashed into building. Uhhhhhhhhhh, not trying to make offensive joke here.
<BonyHepSits> yes otakon, the same
<Ghosties> 04Yes, rifftrax is really saving this film
<twilight_sprinkle> meh, rifftrax is putting me to sleep as always..
<Dark92Enigma> What are those? STAR WARS REJECTS?
<RosePetal> Mr. Schue.
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: true dat
<Reikim> Who the hell wrote this movie? I wish to find him so I can smack him.
<DSNesmith> "just in case the audience doesn't know what's going on anymore"
<XylemTube> They spent 70 million on this movie, and grossed 53 million... Fail
<DSNesmith> to be fair
<Obsidian> Suddenly Episode 1 flashbacks
<DSNesmith> by the last 20 minutes of transformers 2
<RosePetal> Yes, because shooting them will work.
<Pale_Horse> We have to swallow our pride and ask Canada for reinforcements with their genetically revived dinosaur forces... :|
<DSNesmith> I had no clue what the plot was anymore
<fluttercry> 05,15Mann co?
<otakon> XylemTube: no idea why :P
<RosePetal> Oh look there are our "heroes"
<otakon> MANN CO.!
<desertman2> that's 1 kill
<DSNesmith> some exposition would have been nice
<otakon> WE NEED THE HEAVY!
<Meanwhile> Roger Mangoat?
<Reikim> Yeah, but you don't watch Bayformers for plot.
<RosePetal> Dragon ded.
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: I think I warned everyone enough yesterday so no one had there hopes up. :D
<Rookeealding> How did they get in the underground
<DSNesmith> instead of that contrived "run through the desert" scene
<CCCP> is this commentary live?
<otakon> lol
<RosePetal> Don't bring logic.
<fluttercry> 05,15Where's Gondor?
<Klumzeedragon> Their**
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal: they're not heroes, they're ROBOTS
<pony_300> also why are they still bothering with anything less than explosive ordinance and the like? Running around with machine guns at this point is laughable
<otakon> CCCP: no prerecorded
<Reikim> If you are watching Bayformers for plot you are sadly misguided.
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ngz1yCjk1rfqf4io1_500.png
<RosePetal> Let's run away! That's all we can do run!
<CCCP> otakon ok
<otakon> pony_300: first response team?
<BonyHepSits> wtf is Bayformers
<Pale_Horse> The Imoogi ate Gondor. :(
<Dark92Enigma> RUN TO THE HILLS
<otakon> pony_300: nearest unit I would guess
<DSNesmith> FOR TOTAL GLOBAL SATURATION, CHARGE
<RosePetal> DESTROY EVERYONE.
<Nyst> How are they MISSING?
<otakon> HOW DID THEY MISS?
<Reikim> Transformers as directed by Michael Bay.
<Dark92Enigma> Anypony wanna panic with me?
<CCCP> pyrocatboy: :3
<Reikim> Distinguishes it from every other iteration of Transformers.
<RosePetal> Logic don't question it.
<otakon> also, NO WAY IN HELL THEY'RE ALL BULLET PROOF
<Dark92Enigma> AIM FOR THE HEADS
<DaringDerpy> twilight_sprinkle: Random snarky remarks make everything better.
<RosePetal> We need Spartans!
<Elit3xPon3> TERRIBLE AIM
<TWarTovlerWars> Cloverfield reference
<AlienWarhead> Explosion?
<otakon> and the Bulcos SHOOT FIREBALLS
<Nicos> ok, 50 cal machine guns AND THEY STILL MISS?
<Rookeealding> ... another hasbro joke
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yes yes it will
<DSNesmith> my biggest problem with bayformers isn't the lack of plot or the overabundance of explosions
<otakon> I AGREE!
<TWarTovlerWars> ‚Ä¶or will it?
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: not if they arent funny, and are the same in every movie
<RosePetal> They shot that dragon perfectly.
<DSNesmith> it's that he focuses on the human characters no one cares about
<RosePetal> Dats true.
<Tassadork> oh man. I go to fix router problems during hospital drama and return to ROCKET DINOS
<Dark92Enigma> TWarTovlerWars: IT IS CLOVERFIELD....Only 3000 years later
<Reikim> There's that too.
<DSNesmith> the transformers are just set pieces
<RosePetal> Dark knight truck.
<Rookeealding> Blow up all the Cars!
<DSNesmith> also
<Reikim> Should have axed Witwicky after the first movie.
<DSNesmith> >shia labeouf
<otakon> HOW DO THEY KEEP MISSING?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Headshot
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<otakon> and ofc it HITS THE HELMET
<DaringDerpy> twilight_sprinkle: actually, when these guys were sitting in my cinema, I would have punched them in the face by now
<Rookeealding> FBI good or bad
<BonyHepSits> we only came for giant robots beating the shit out of each other
<Pale_Horse> Somewhere Michael Bay is having an Orgasm and dosen't know why. :D
<otakon> and the creature is fine
<pony_300> one thing I'm enjoying is that atleast the military is actually effective
<Elit3xPon3> BOOM HEADSHOT
<TWarTovlerWars> Dark92Enigma: oh yeah, they did say that.
<Crippler> this is the fifth car they've jumped into
<Reikim> My thoughts on the third movie are thus:
<RosePetal> Our heroes everyone, they run away and let innocent people die.
<otakon> also, WHY ARE THE SOLDIERS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE GODDAMN TANKS?
<DSNesmith> lawl at korea
<RosePetal> Way to fucking go:|
<TWarTovlerWars> weird. The movie is now louder than the riffs.
<DSNesmith> lol at NK vs SK
<Midnight_Fyre> :D
<otakon> Seriously, stand BEHIND THE TANKS
<Spectrum_Rush> Wilhelm #2
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: me too, tbh
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Wilhelm
<DSNesmith> WILHELM
<Tassadork> more wilhelm
<Reikim> You can skip roughly a third of it and not miss anything.
<fluttercry> 05,15Wihelm again?
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, more wilhelm
<TWarTovlerWars> Dragon scale armor
<MLP_Brovakiin> WILHEML
<otakon> WILHEIM!
<AlienWarhead> WILHELM!
<MrBen> Wilhelm x2!
<Pale_Horse> Wilhelm!!!
<pony_300> usually in movies like this when ancient magics or technology faces off with current age weapony, current age gets curbstomped
<CCCP> :o
<RosePetal> Wilhelm again.
<Midnight_Fyre> But NK made Pulgasari
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal: if they're not heroes, WHO ARE WE SUPOSSED TO ROOT FOR
<otakon> TWarTovlerWars: tuff stuff
<Rookeealding> bye bye LA
<Reikim> That third being anything involving LaBoeuf and his retarded girlfriend.
<pony_300> also, ONE Wilhiem scream per movie!
<Dark92Enigma> WILHELM!!!!!
<DSNesmith> I want to see a movie where modern day stuff completely owns the ancient enemies
<Rosfox> I am so bored of the mindless action I am falling alseep...
<TWarTovlerWars> otakon: and light too
<DSNesmith> like, the army of mummies charges an artillery line
<otakon> DSNesmith: it'll never happen
<DSNesmith> and vanishes
<RosePetal> The zookeeper guy. He's the real hero Dark92Egima.
<AlienWarhead> Why is this boring dragons vs miltary should be more fun
<CCCP> lol
<otakon> Bulcos
<Mozdoc> Okay, I just got back... and what the hell is this? Why is this the most ridiculous thing I've seen? Dragons with missile launchers on their backs? Normally, I'd say that this is the coolest thing ever, but this movie manages to make that look absurd...
<Nyst> Maybe they should have used the tanks against the dragons and the helicopters against the ground army.
<RosePetal> Cuz it's predictable.
<Quick_Thinker> to much CGI in the way
<Dark92Enigma> Who directed this shit? MICHAEL BAY!?
<Rex_Mundi> pony_300: That diddnt happen in the Fullmetal alchemist movie
<Klumzeedragon> Is this movie banned after this? :D
<Rookeealding> We're bad
<TWarTovlerWars> huh, what's going on now?
<RosePetal> Well at least he killed the dragon.
<DSNesmith> the weird thing is
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal yeah
<otakon> Mozdoc: not Dragons, Dawdlers and Bulcos(flying creatures)
<pony_300> oh shit the movie remembered it had a plot it was supposed to be following
<Elit3xPon3> kamikaze helicopter
<RosePetal> i don't know.
<DSNesmith> labeouf can be a good actor
<Rookeealding> they are the MIB?
<Reikim> Still, I enjoy Bayformers for the beautiful giant robots beating seven types of hell out of each other, and shit blowing up.
<wirisme1989> the car though
<XylemTube> how far are we through the movie?
<Quick_Thinker> the movie will be banned but the rift wont

<AlienWarhead> The dragon FBI
<otakon> so the Government ofc KNEW THE WHOLE GODDAMN TIME
<Reikim> Oh, Holes.
<Midnight_Fyre> About 20 minutes left
<Reikim> That was good.
<Quick_Thinker> i knew it was the FBI
<RosePetal> The Rifftrax is not banned but the real movie is.
<Pale_Horse> Soooo... how come the government dosent have any other viable paranormal soulutions? :/
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Idiot
<desertman2> he ded
<DSNesmith> Disturbia was good too, though not as good as the hitchcock film
<RAWRity> He's not a bad actor, it's just that Sam Witwicky is a god awful character

<Nicos> wow, i felt sorry for the FBI agent, and not the main character getting shot
<DaringDerpy> Rex_Mundi: not at all
<RosePetal> I changed my mind. Let us run into the Sunset.

<Ghosties> 04Dude, Combos are awesome
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just keep going to populated cities and slaughter them all!
<RosePetal> Yes go to Mexico where more innocents will die.
<DSNesmith> movie starts, we're like "okay, area 51"
<desertman2> I don't think they show any wounds in this
<DSNesmith> lady gets out of car
<Quick_Thinker> SUDDENLY i go up to the projectors booth and set fire to the film
<DSNesmith> walks up to jones

<DaringDerpy> so she is a dragon princess or something? didn't watch the whole movie
<otakon> And then Micheal bay CAME again
<Quick_Thinker> DED
<Everlasting_Joy> No, the dragons don't want to cross the border. . . For some reason.
<Quick_Thinker> DEDEDEDEDEDEDEDEDEDEDE
<Reikim> Just like D-Wars.
<Rosfox> Gah to much explosions and CGI
<pony_300> HAHAHAHAHAH the main characters are invincible
<DSNesmith> its whole premise was flawed
<TWarTovlerWars> dat Wanda
<Polydunami> Also, can't believe I'm older than the female lead :S
<Reikim> It COULD have works.
<RosePetal> Cuz no matter where you go the army follows you and more innocents die. And yet you are cowards, and can't act for crap so why don't you surrender yourself so no more innocents die?
<pony_300> HULK OUT?
<Reikim> *worked
<Rex_Mundi> KEKEKEKEK
<DSNesmith> indiana jones is about religious artifacts
<Quick_Thinker> BULLSHIT

<Quick_Thinker> BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT
<Elit3xPon3> lolol
<Obsidian> Hey look! They found Gondor!
<RosePetal> No emotions at all.
<Rookeealding> why no kill him?
<otakon> DaringDerpy: she's basically the chosen one that can be sacrificed to an Imoogi to grant it diety status
<DSNesmith> also
<AlienWarhead> Everlasting_Joy they don't have passports
<Reikim> Remove the aliens, rework the plot, presto! problem solved.
<DSNesmith> too many action scenes
<Marx> Mordor?!
<DSNesmith> not enough archeology scenes
<Rex_Mundi> This is a Korean movie? where is the starcraft?
<AlienWarhead> Mordor!
<Quick_Thinker> YOU CANNOT SURIVE A FUCKIN EXPLOSION
<XaviortheSavior> We're in Mordor suddenly
<Everlasting_Joy> AlienWarhead: :) That.
<RosePetal> Now they will be tortured.
<TWarTovlerWars> And now they're over there now.

<fluttercry> 05,15SARAH

<Quick_Thinker> ITS AT LEAST 500 F
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Jason!
<RosePetal> Somehow the woman lived from a car crash.
<Reikim> Part of the reason I like the first is because they actually get a lot of things right about the Ark.
<DSNesmith> crusaders had the snake bit, the first scene, and the face melting scene
<RosePetal> SARAH.
<TWarTovlerWars> KAGOME!
<fluttercry> 05,15SHAUN
<Mozdoc> Darth Vader? What the fuck...
<otakon> THAT is why she wasn't killed

<DaringDerpy> oh, thx, otakon
<Reikim> Also, WHEN THE HELL DID THEY GET THIS?
<fluttercry> 05,15TETSUO!

<Jigglysaint> thousands of people dead but at least the dragon is okay
<Rookeealding> Ok we done now?
<Barbetos> lol
<Reikim> So is it just pointlessly flying now?
<RosePetal> The dragon is showing better emotion than the main hero.
<Quick_Thinker> XD
<Obsidian> So...how does he get home again?
<AlienWarhead> Pale_Horse The movie didn't explain anything
<Reikim> \
<Sumica> 00,10500 years they do it all over again

<RosePetal> How will I get home?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: better question is WHERE IS HE?
<pony_300> otakon: and much like how the transformers fighting looked like a bunch of metal grinding against eachother, this was two snake creatures rolling around erratically in the dirt.
<Rosfox> xD
<Reikim> No, seriously, I want a timestamp
<Everlasting_Joy> Dken2021: Nope.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What a ending

<Quick_Thinker> OH MOVIE STOP TRYING TO HAVE A"EPIC" music cue
<Midnight_Fyre> Reikim: But the Rifftrax was excellent
<MrBen> Sumica: That was easily the best part, Rifftrax or no.
<Rustymeat> Seven asses
<Obsidian> Dken2021: it was only for a moment but everyone heard it
<Elit3xPon3> nuuuuuuuuuuuu i dont wanna watch credits
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
<Mozdoc> You know, when I saw this movie title was being played, I was like "Oh yay, something with dragons". But then I had to leave, and came back towards the end and... I'm really glad I didn't see it.
<Klumzeedragon> Ghosties: So your combined score is 10.5/10?
<Quick_Thinker> YOUR AN EPIC FAIL
<AlienWarhead> So the black guy is the only main character alive probably boy we were off
<Tassadork> JESmith71: what you said

<Barbetos> SpadeMagnes[R] rifftrax saod something about MLP
<RAWRity> Amoogi/10
<RosePetal> WMC the actual movie but not the Rifftrax. Rifftrax is the only way I will make it past this movie.

<otakon> what game?
<DSNesmith> but the papyrus
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Night!
<RAWRity> seriously, THEY'RE USING FUCKING PAPYRUS. THIS IS WORSE THAN AVATAR.
<DSNesmith> drove me bonkers

<Elit3xPon3> seeya
<otakon> DSNesmith: I didn't see that and thought you were talking about this
<DrSteveSCARz> whats next?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thank you all :3 *hugs*
<spitfirecolt> who won the lottery
<Obsidian> oohsorry Night Spazturtle
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It always annoys me to see the military always curbstomped in films with alien races
<Elit3xPon3> PONIES
<AlienWarhead> I didn't hear the full MLP reference during the military invades the cave scene was it "My Little PonyConvention"
<JESmith> Hearth's Warming Eve
<Reikim> So can we go right now and assign a WMC on the non-Rifftrax version of this?
<DSNesmith> Midnight_Fyre: was talking about PoP
<RosePetal1> Why does this music sound so epic?
<Dr_Fumbles> SpadeMagnes[R]: I agree
<wirisme1989> dies irae
<DSNesmith> not this festering pile of snake crap
<RosePetal1> The music is SO MUCH better than the actual movie.
<p4ngya> tell me this movie's going on the ban list
<pony_300> still, the main character had a personality more stoic than keanu reeves, and no explanatin for why he was taking so much shit effortlessly and without a scratch.
<Midnight_Fyre> Oh, OK. Still not a great film, but nothing to be horribly ashamed of like if you meant this
<Klumzeedragon> I warned every pony it was terrible. :D No one listened!
<Dken2021> RosePetal1 a orchestra can make anything sound epic, bonus point if it also has a latin chourus
<Pale_Horse> I listened. :P
<TWarTovlerWars> seeing as we can't find a proper copy of this movie, I'd say this movie WMC'd itself.
<Midnight_Fyre> Best Boy Grip?
<Dr_Fumbles> Steve Jablonski is the ONLY good thing about this movie
<RosePetal1> The non Rifftrax of this movie will be WMC. But the Rifftrax version lives on.
<DSNesmith> mmm
<Reikim> Prince of Persia would have been better if they'd stuck to the game's plot.
<otakon> pony_300: bullet doesn't phase him
<Rookeealding> The point of a b movie is to be terrible right?
<Midnight_Fyre> Just sawe that in the credits
<Reikim> The new plot was kind of lacklustre.
<Everlasting_Joy> Rookeealding: Yep.
<RAWRity> >Special Effects Coordinator
<otakon> pony_300: car crash knocks him out for apparently days
<DSNesmith> yeah, just the prince and the girl wandering through ruins
<RosePetal1> That Zookeeper was sadly the only thing good about it.
<otakon> Rookeealding: no it's not
<Klumzeedragon> Pale_Horse: Thanks~ 6_9
<DSNesmith> the new plot was meh
<twilight_sprinkle> Rookeealding: not necessarily, but they often are
<pyrocatboy> otakon http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ni03zXsg1rfqf4io1_500.png
<RAWRity> >Edward Surkis you should be ashamed
<Pale_Horse> NP.
<DSNesmith> although I admit, I fell for the "brother did it" ruse
<Reikim> I hereby motion that the non-Rifftrax D-War be put on the WMC list. All in favour?
<richfiles> LOL, Riftrax is so awesome! This movie had now redeeming qualities without it! :D
<otakon> Rookeealding: the point of a B moive is to be a cult hit or a cheap movie that is still good
<Dken2021> Rookeealding it doesn't have to be horrible, it could either be of low production or a cult following
<Rookeealding> Sure seems like it some time
<DSNesmith> was genuinely surprised when the bad guy turned out to be the obviously evil bald dude
<otakon> Reikim: AGREED!
<Pale_Horse> Aye.
<Klumzeedragon> Rookeealding: not that terrible. xD
<Kirusaki_Pony> Man....
<pyrocatboy> yes
<DSNesmith> also it had great credits music
<Obsidian> Agreed
<Sumica> 00,10now now, this movie did have two good parts
<RosePetal1> Can we discuss how bad the heroes were?
<Kirusaki_Pony> I came at the end of the damn movie...
<DSNesmith> and that one guy
<DSNesmith> uh
<Rex_Mundi> http://th07.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2012/125/2/8/evil_cadence_by_askheroichamburger-d4ynbdg.jpg
<Sumica> 00,10the old woman walking in to the fence
<TWarTovlerWars> India's massive budget movie was way better than South Koreas
<otakon> Sumica: can we put the NON Rifftrax version of this on WMC?
<DSNesmith> alec baldwin?
<DSNesmith> no
<DSNesmith> shoot
<RAWRity> here's my issue with the Prince of Persia move
<otakon> Sumica: perfect
<RAWRity> *movie
<Sumica> 00,10and the guy geting hit by two cars
<Dken2021> ...why did that woman run ito a fence?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: yeah within a minute of each other
<Rookeealding> Sumaia yea the villian getting hit with a car twice
<pony_300> getting blown up in a fuckin car traveling at high speed, makes him PASS OUT without a scratch on him. The fucker is Clark Kent.
<DSNesmith> whatsisname
<Kirusaki_Pony> xD
<desertman2> yep
<Pale_Horse> I will admit, the fence-woman was hillarious. :D
<BonyHepSits> I didn't think it was that bad. Wasn't good, but wasn't bad either
<Polydunami> Damn, Rex_Mundi, that is sexy :3
<Reikim> But seriously, that does not defend the movie.
<richfiles> The End... Was Riftrax comentary the other part? :D
<RosePetal1> Lol Sumica you are right those were the only things I found amusing.
<DSNesmith> molina
<DSNesmith> uh
<desertman2> Because the guy walked through a fence
<DSNesmith> alfric?
<MrBen> Right, I'm duckin' on out. Later, y'all!
<pyrocatboy> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ni03zXsg1rfqf4io1_500.png
<otakon> okay
<RAWRity> In the opening, the king sees his servant beating a young boy. Does nothing. Another boy stands up for his friend. Makes him a prince.
<RosePetal1> But the movie still sucks though.
<Reikim> Hell, if we hadn't had Rifftrax, half the chat would be leaving in disgust.
<DSNesmith> alfred
<otakon> how come HE can type forever and a day
<Everlasting_Joy> Night MrBen!
<PillowPoni> night MrBen
<NocturnalBlade> nite MrBen
<DSNesmith> alfred molina was good in it
<RAWRity> that king is a DICK
<Elit3xPon3> night
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is WMC?
<DSNesmith> lol
<RosePetal1> Yeah Reikim.
<otakon> but I get kicked every other goddamn sentece?
<otakon> THE HELL KICK BOTS!
<Rex_Mundi> Polydunami: She is sexy, isnt she?
<Pale_Horse> Worst Movie Clause
<CrimsonPhoenix> winged snake/10
<Reikim> Worst Movie Clause.
<otakon> THE FUCKING HELL!
<Klumzeedragon> Im going to go get food. I'll probably return shortly.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: rifftrax makes me leave in disgust anyway
<DSNesmith> hey otakon just be grateful they took the autoban off
<superretroworld> weren;t we suppose to be watching over the hedge?
<RAWRity> otakon: do not anger the Daribot
<DSNesmith> I got banned three times during the babes in toyland stream alone
<RosePetal1> Worst Movie Clause. So far only Babes in Toyland and Epic Movie have been WMCD.
<Reikim> superretroworld: Watched that earlier for A.
<Rookeealding> Is there anything in FAQ about WMC?
<Dr_Fumbles> twilight_sprinkle: fuck you
<otakon> superretroworld: been there done that, movies start at 7
<Dken2021> superretroworld I think that played first
<Tovler> without rifftrax, I would have had forgetten the plot entirely.
<RosePetal1> Why does this music seem so epic.
<Polydunami> No, I mean that her face is kind of appealing in that face :$
<Everlasting_Joy> Rookeealding: Yes.
<superretroworld> oh
<desertman2> superretroworld: That was the A-movie
<Pale_Horse> Similar to the Santa Clause, except in the ways in which it's completely different. :P
<pony_300> the rifftrax got much better as the movie went on... either that or I reached a point where I mentally blocked out all but their top jokes.
<Reikim> I am dead freaking serious about WMC'ing this.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dr_Fumbles: ^_- okay?
<Polydunami> *Picture, not face at the end :S

<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: It's a kid show.:D
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: now it's Luna Eclipsed or Party of One
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: maybe it has, idk :P
<AlienWarhead> Sumica I think they may be tied
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Because apperently this predates Celestia who's centuries old
<Crippler> OH U

<Polydunami> Oh no, not my hair
<Polydunami> :|
<Rookeealding> what is it with other ponies that they must put blush on fluttershy?
<Midnight_Fyre> twilight_sprinkle: Heart Carol is underrated
<Reikim> I like this episode.
<twilight_sprinkle> Midnight_Fyre: ikr!
<TheRandomkid321> Rainbitch Dash
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So arrogent
<Barbetos> Well I am off to bed. Night everyone.
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R] some counties are older than a thousand years
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back.............................and THE MOVIE IS OVER!????????????
<RAWRity> like, it's to the point where I kind of have a knee jerk reaction to hate luna, just because this fandom creams itself over her so much.
<TheRandomkid321> PLOT!
<Mozdoc> Oh Rainbow...so full of yourself...
<superretroworld> night Barbetos
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Barbetos
<spitfirecolt> its my gf dashie

<Rex_Mundi> Are there no pony Rockettes?
<Elit3xPon3> PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Dark92Enigma> SHAAAAAAAAAADUP
<Obsidian> Night Barbetos
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<pony_300> rainbow dash's ego is on max this episode
<Sumica> 00,10lol the fire
<Nicos> and, 7 colgates
<richfiles> SHUT THE ***** :D
<Sumica> 00,10check the fire place
<Nyst> Yup. Elements of Harmony.
<Elit3xPon3> SSSSHHHH
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The days of G1
<Crippler> THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO
<Rookeealding> If spike was a pony, I think his cutie mark would be Communication related. Narrator, Announcer and secretary
<Reikim> Luna and Trixie.
<TheRandomkid321> This reminds me of G3 teaparty
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> gasp*
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if pinkie can think inside a fireplace
<RAWRity> and I have nothing against Luna. But dawn if this fandom doesn't all want to be her god damn White Knight.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: THey just explained it right there.
<otakon> Sumica: Blue moon my ASS
<Reikim> The fandom likes them way too much.
<AlienWarhead> Dark92Enigma short movies compared to the LOTR and that Indian robot movie
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> mud ponies
<Pale_Horse> This episode raises questions for me... It seems when Equestria was founded, Alicorns weren't around... So where did they come from and how did they become the leaders? (Other than the fact that they are obviously powerful enough to get whatever they want).
<RAWRity> *damn
<Elit3xPon3> HATRED
<Derpy_Hooves> http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/16674
<Midnight_Fyre> twilight_sprinkle: I hope we find out
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm pretty sure celestia is older than that
<Reikim> Luna and Trixie. Kneejerk against the fandom's use of them.
<Sumica> 00,10your ass is a full moon otakon?
<RAWRity> Actually, the fandom's rather split on trixie
<Dark92Enigma> AlienWarhead: Tommorrow, I will not MISS IT
<AJIsAwesome> Pale_Horse: It's a cartoon?:S
<otakon> Pale_Horse: a fourth rare tribe that only exists in very small numbers
<Reikim> They have their place, I like them, but the fandom...
<RAWRity> for instance, I know meanwhile hates her so much that I now ship him with her
<Crippler> WHAT
<twilight_sprinkle> so like our world, basically
<Rex_Mundi> otakon: Seaponies?
<JESmith> Sumica: If his pants are down it is
<otakon> Sumica: no but the moon is not blue
<spitfirecolt> she is over 3000 yrs old
<Pale_Horse> Guess I should remember my MST3K mantra. :P
<Flootahshy> Ah see ponies!
<Reikim> I don't like the people who read too much into Trixie than she is.
<Nyst> It sounds like they had a mutually beneficial alliance.
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Brad__> twilight_sprinkle, she can think inside a chiminy
<otakon> So what was this original land they came from?
<Dken2021> and poor applejack has less fans than background ponies
<Rookeealding> this get's me... fan fic has ponies fearing what spike might become... nopony ever says anything about him narrating a play.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pale_Horse, simple answer:Genetics
<cowvarkian> otakon: this is just a legend
<AlienWarhead> Pale_Horse maybe they live elsewhere and came after Equestria was made
<Polydunami> The Moon is Blue? Isn't that banned in Boston? :S
<otakon> I wonder if it's sstill frozen
<fluttercry> 05,15Like how she MUST have a reason to be the way she is and deep down she's a good pony?
<twilight_sprinkle> Brad__: but will it blend?..er i mean but what about a fireplace
<Sumica> 00,10that was why I said "blue" moon otakon
<XylemTube> Famine is cannon
<Reikim> She's arrogant and stupid and deluded. No she does not have any redeeming qualities. No she is not pathetic. No she is not a Woobie.
<otakon> Sumica: well it's sure as hell not blue
<Elit3xPon3> windigos
<Reikim> Fuck I'm sick of seeing that.
<Crippler> This needs to be narrated by the Christmas ghost of the past from the future.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14inb4 S3 gives her a redemption episode
<Pale_Horse> Magic having only b een invented 2 weeks earlier...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and I will drink all the salty tears
<Reikim> I want to see a fic where Trixie is a delusional jackass.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and laugh at all the butthurt
<AlienWarhead> DragonBorn!
<cowvarkian> otakon: because we all know that granny smith's family founded ponyville
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Everypony is starving: wear a pudding hat
<Kirusaki_Pony> xD
<Applechip> what's the production value of this play?
<DaringDerpy> invent cannibalism
<Reikim> Hell, I'm going to write that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Each time I look up at the moon
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh Pinkie :).
<Dken2021> if that happens...then again, I don't wanna know
<otakon> PUDDINGHEAD IS BEST PONY!
<twilight_sprinkle> the earth pony queen is a bitch
<otakon> and then
<spitfirecolt> thats my dashie
<CrimsonPhoenix> I see the Mare in the moon
<Rookeealding> so when she puts the crown on wrong here... was that a staged thing.. or did she somehow screw up the play?
<otakon> RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!
<AlienWarhead> Applechip magic
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: shes a bitch
<Nyst> This is still Equestria. An Equestria with smaller borders, more wild animals and other threats, and of course split into three nations.
<Pale_Horse> Rabble rablle rablle rabble
<RAWRity> And then there's the folks who not only gush over Luna, but then complain that she doesn't get enough screen time. Except that, outside of SPike and the CMC SHE'S THE ONLY NON-MAIN CHARACTER TO HAVE HER OWN EPISODE.
<Flootahshy> twilight_sprinkle: HOW DARE YOU!
<Reikim> My co-author wants me to write stereotypical Trixie crap? Fuck that, she's now irredeemable.
<otakon> Rookeealding: I think screw up
<twilight_sprinkle> pegasisisisissisisisisi
<Dark92Enigma> In a CIVILIZED WAY.
<Elit3xPon3> pegasuseseseses
<pony_300> Pinkie exe is glitching
<twilight_sprinkle> pinkie.exe has stopped responding
<otakon> Pegasissisisisi
<CrimsonPhoenix> You know you're a Brony if you see the mare figure in the moon while looking up on it.
<Reikim> This is now a thing.
<Pale_Horse> Pegasauruses!
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<cowvarkian> freakie magic is best magic
<Ponies47> Dem Pegasisisisisis
<Crippler> BURN THE WITCH
<Dark92Enigma> SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT PICKLE PICKLE PICKLE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Specism!
<Reikim> I will be relying on you all to remind me of this.
<XylemTube> Lol Rascim
<AlienWarhead> It must be the dirty Zebras
<Dark92Enigma> LAWL
<DaringDerpy> jewnicorn are behind this
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Racism!
<Midnight_Fyre> I want to carve Commander Hurrican in black marble, but I think I need more practice with carving stone before I try it
<XylemTube> :O
<Pale_Horse> Pegasaurus Rex...
<cowvarkian> ikr DaringDerpy
<Applechip> AlienWarhead: OFCOURSE!
<twilight_sprinkle> Flootahshy: well she is, look at how she treats the pony applejack plays
<fluttercry> 05,15I feel bad for saying this, but I love when the show destroys fanon
<otakon> RAWRity: true but we've only seen her a grand total of 3 times
<RAWRity> like people bitching about Luna not being in the Finale. WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE ADDED?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim i was asked by you to remind you that trixie is best pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh yeah
<Dark92Enigma> The Tiara is worn backwards
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim there i reminded you
<Everlasting_Joy> I love the way Princess Platinum wears that crown.
<otakon> RAWRity: kicking changling ass maybe?
*Reikim clubs TheGreatAndPowerfulT with a brick
<TheRandomkid321> Youtube in a nutshell
<Elit3xPon3> uh rarity?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pinkie's best line in this episode
<Dark92Enigma> THE WINDIGOS
<Flootahshy> twilight_sprinkle: but but but Pinkie Pie!
<fluttercry> 05,15also, I remember people bitched a lot about Luna in her episode....whatever happened to that?
<Dken2021> fluttercry like every other fandom with their show?
<Dark92Enigma> TheRandomkid321: IKR'
<RAWRity> otakon: and one of those 3 times was an ENTIRE EPISODE DEDICATED TO HER. Despite NOT BEING A GOD DAMN MAIN CHARACTER.
<twilight_sprinkle> Flootahshy: shes not pinkie tho
<Reikim> This episode
<Reikim> I forgot how great this ep is.
<Flootahshy> twilight_sprinkle: but but but... but...
<Everlasting_Joy> CrimsonPhoenix: Which one?
<TheRandomkid321> Sir?
<Rookeealding> so do you think spike is sticking to the script or ablibing some of his lines?
<otakon> RAWRity: she's still a major character
<Flootahshy> Shuddup.
<Rex_Mundi> She seems more of a 'Sesnirp' to me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim may i ask what's what your co-author want you to do ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> it'll come up in time
<cowvarkian> yes, Rookeealding
<RAWRity> otakon: no. she isn't.
<TheRandomkid321> R34 COMMUNITY WAS RIGHT!
<twilight_sprinkle> Flootahshy: so many butts
<Everlasting_Joy> CrimsonPhoenix: Fair enough.
<pony_300> Yes SIR Rainbow Dash SIR!
<otakon> so Pegasi are naturally bloodthristy?
<RAWRity> otakon: she's a secondary character at BEST.
<thelonepony> Fluttershy looks so cute in her armor!!
<Elit3xPon3> is rainbow dash's character a guy?
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I've gone through this before. I ranted for maybe half an hour. I felt better afterwards.
<Pale_Horse> Twilight as Rather Dashing. :D
<cowvarkian> sure, Elit3xPon3
<Dark92Enigma> Elit3xPon3: Tomboy.......
<twilight_sprinkle> ker-splash
<AlienWarhead> Nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> Here it comes
<otakon> RAWRity: she RAISES THE FUCKING MOON she helps run goddamn Equestria for cribs sake
<Dark92Enigma> SANTA PINKIE CLAUS
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: he means in the play
<Elit3xPon3> i mean commander hurricane
<Midnight_Fyre> Elit3xPon3: It's never stated
<RAWRity> Celestia plays more of an important role than her, and yet I don't see people clamoring to see an episode about Celestia, unless it involves Luna somehow.
<otakon> Smart Cookie is great
<AlienWarhead> The door is covered in snow
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: Oh, yeah.
<twilight_sprinkle> now ignite the fire
<wirisme1989> that logic
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> that trombone
<otakon> Thinking inside the chimney
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh my gosh
<otakon> love it
<Sumica> 00,10dat pinkie face
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat face
<AlienWarhead> CLOSE UP
<Rookeealding> hu.. a wah but not a wah wah
<otakon> I LOVE THAT FACE
<Tovler> light baaaalb
<Reikim> Luna and Celestia WORK because they DON'T take spotlight.
<Polydunami> Brilliant!
<richfiles> :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> I am just about to be BRILLIANT
<Mozdoc> Applejack could think in the chimney, but...it'd be ill advised.
<Everlasting_Joy> Cutie Pie face!
<Dark92Enigma> DAT FACE nneded a SQUEE
<otakon> I LOVE THAT LINE AND THAT FACE!
<pony_300> break that fourth wall AJ
<Dark92Enigma> needed*
<Dken2021> I think it's becasue they see Luna as the atoner
<Elit3xPon3> dat face lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> Best Pinkie line
<Reikim> Also: Applejack is WONDERFULLY snarky in this ep. I want to see more of this from her.
<RAWRity> otakon: I'm talking about in the show itself. In the show, she's not importatn. She's a side character. The important characters are the Main Six anc occasionally the CMC
<pyrocatboy> See you guys tommarow.
<Pale_Horse> Except for your hat, of course
<RAWRity> Reikim: same.
<tSparx> dat ponymas
<Rex_Mundi> Who eleted her?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Grow food with what? they dont have anything to grow
<twilight_sprinkle> bye pyrocatboy
<Obsidian> Bye pyrocatboy
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care pyrocatboy.
<NocturnalBlade> see pyrocatboy
<spitfirecolt> no pinkie tail that dress must be tight
<Rex_Mundi> *elected
<Elit3xPon3> bye
<AlienWarhead> I just don't know what went wrong
<otakon> RAWRity: in the show the CMC are not important
<Rookeealding> Love AJ's sarcasm in this episode
<NocturnalBlade> *see ya
<RAWRity> Dken2021: they see Luna as a woobie for them to try and "Save" or "fix"
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: it was a revolution
<Reikim> Element of Honesty: License to Snark.
<richfiles> Pansy Hump!
<Nyst> Shame the unicorns didn't try to transmute food. Or make a cold resistant crop. That's what you get for taking things for granted.
<otakon> and yet the CMC have had like 4 eps
<richfiles> :D :(
<AlienWarhead> bye NocturnalBlade
<Rex_Mundi> War is canon
<Applechip> Rex_Mundi: That's a very good question
<RAWRity> because good god damn do some in the fandom LOVE them a woobie to cry over.
<Dark92Enigma> TONIGHT, WE'LL DINE IN HELL
<tSparx> Nyst: But then there wouldn't be a modern equestria, and the show wouldn't exist.
<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaawww
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Stop whining
<otakon> RAWRity: are you getting angry over people wanting to see some more Luna?
<PillowPoni> Bye NocturnalBlade
<Reikim> I prefer seeing Luna as a strong character.
<twilight_sprinkle> Rarity's voice <3
<Dark92Enigma> 5 MINUTES!???????
<cowvarkian> don't these guys know that granny smith
<Dken2021> RAWRity huh, better word for it I suppose
<Reikim> She's a freaking goddess, for Celestia's sake.
<Elit3xPon3> lol 5 mins
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: Tabitha St. Germain, GREAT voice actress
<Nyst> One can assume that the Pegasi actually did fight a variety of threats on their way to the new land.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh god damn it
<Mozdoc> Whine whine whine goes Rarity...
<tSparx> Oh Rarity <3
<cowvarkian> s family found ponyville
<Dark92Enigma> Do something.....or CUT
<XylemTube> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i could listen to her whining all day
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<Ponies47> Dat stream
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tabitha is best VA
<otakon> Reikim: agreed
<Rustymeat> stream within a stream
<CrimsonPhoenix> in both talent and personality
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: lol
<NocturnalBlade> lol no i'm not leavin...wash saying goodbye to pyro
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R] she is not whining she is compaining
<Ghosties> 04PPPPPPPPPPPPegasus
<twilight_sprinkle> pehgasis
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What a primadona
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<richfiles> Stream, in a stream! Streamception! :O
<RAWRity> otakon: because they ARE important. They're meant as younger foils to the Mane 6, as well as a focus for the whole growing pains type of lessons that wouldn't fit with the Mane 6
<Tovler> hmmm *scrolls up to get context on this argument*
<AlienWarhead> nothing sexual here
<Polydunami> o////O
<NocturnalBlade> *was
<Everlasting_Joy> RArity <3.
<Rex_Mundi> This world must be like the G1 ponyverse, with random monsters and threats everywhere
<Nyst> Earth ponies would know how to avoid threats. Unicorns could defend themselves.
<DaringDerpy> lol
<Reikim> It's not really an argument.
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: Are you behind?
<otakon> Ghosties: so the Unicorns are snooty, the Pegasi are bloodthristy and the Earth Ponies are serfs...
<XylemTube> what a biatch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Rarity *ahem* mounted Twilight
<RAWRity> I also dislike how people act like Luna would make a better ruler than Celestia, or make Celestia out to be a tyrant.
<Dark92Enigma> Slavery, Race Superiority and Racism in an MLP FIM
<Reikim> It's more like all of us generally agreeing that the fandom can be stupid.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tovler basicly rant about people liking luna and trixie and pretty much everything else
<Dark92Enigma> episode
<cowvarkian> ikr
<Pale_Horse> Yer Chancellorness...
<Ravebrony> gotta love Rarity! <3 ;)
<tSparx> "How would we survive if I just randomly shut up?"
<Reikim> RAWRity: Lunaverse. I refuse to even touch it.
<otakon> RAWRity: and yet they surely are NOT part of the main group
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> there is no up or down
<AlienWarhead> Nope
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> as far as i could read so far
<Rex_Mundi> Its buffering a lot for me
<XylemTube> Logic
<otakon> I love Pinkie in this ep
<otakon> dat rewind
<Dark92Enigma> BACKWARD PINKIE
<Reikim> \
<Quick_Thinker> a big shot
<Dken2021> Reikim any fandom can be out of control sadly
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Pale_Horse> Pinkie Slobber.
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni and AlienWarhead sorry, miscommunication XD
<Dark92Enigma> LAWL
<otakon> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim you din't even know about that until i told you it existed
<RAWRity> Despite that whenever there's a large scale problem, Celestia shows up to try and fix shit, or gets twilight and the EoH on it.
<Elit3xPon3> spitball
<Dken2021> it's what's to be expected
<TheRandomkid321> I guess pinkie spits.
<tSparx> otakon: I love Pinkie in every episode <3
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: And as soon as I heard about it I refused to touch it.
<Midnight_Fyre> Dark92Enigma: All those things were already covered in Bridle Gossip and A Dog and Pony Show
<otakon> the hell is Lunaverse?
<AlienWarhead> ok NocturnalBlade
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim because ?
<Benickerson> Hey everyone!
<Quick_Thinker> thats paradise how?
<otakon> and the Fluttershy built it
<AlienWarhead> New York
<Pale_Horse> How come only spike has the old timey accent?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Chaos emeralds?
<NocturnalBlade> hi Benickerson
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Applechip> Flutterdhy can see the future?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Holy crap
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I disagree with it on several fundamental points.
<XylemTube> Pegasopolis?
<Dark92Enigma> Midnight_Fyre: EEEEYUP. But in a whole EPISODE?
<Reikim> Just
<AlienWarhead> Russia
<Obsidian> Hello Benickerson
<Reikim> Conceptually
<CrimsonPhoenix> This is possibly one of the rare if not the only good Merriwhether episode
<otakon> Can you do that?
<Ponies47> Dat Rarity :3
<twilight_sprinkle> haha, the dazzling has been doubled!
<Reikim> It gives me indigestion.
<Midnight_Fyre> Good point
<Rookeealding> He thought it would help his chracter?
<RAWRity> In her time since she returned, what has Luna accomplished? She cancelled a national holiday because it hurt her feelings, and told Twilight to stay indoors.
<otakon> Can you be dazzled twice?
<Ponies47> DIRT!
<tSparx> Midnight_Fyre: Yeah, but now it's out beloved Ponies who've fallen victim to this behaviour.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon fic stuff in wich luna is powerful and banish celestia and there is other mane sic and so on
<Ghosties> 04I'll call it
<Ghosties> 04Earth
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Dirtville!
<AlienWarhead> Bob
<Reikim> ^
<Quick_Thinker> we will call it.... this land
<TheRandomkid321> Must be from Sips Co.
<Dark92Enigma> OH THE ANVIL OF IRONY!!!!!!!!!!!
<otakon> Ghosties: bob
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> call it Steve
<Reikim> THIS IS WHY I WON'T TOUCH IT
<wirisme1989> earth all along
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Elit3xPon3> pegasopolis, unicornia, earth
<cowvarkian> earth
<Midnight_Fyre> Princess Platinum's theme is best music in this episode, and some of the best in the series
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Huh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim well k you don't like it point taken why you should bash on it ?
<otakon> CALL IT BOB!
<Dark92Enigma> OH EARTH..... CALL THEH..EARTH
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dirtville is best ville
<Pale_Horse> See? Earth ponies DO have powers. That was some wild-fast plant growing.
<Reikim> I'm not bashing it
<Tovler> After watching Gravity Falls' Pacifica Northwest, I don't want to see Trixie. The proud yet worthless bitch character gets old after a while.
<Reikim> I'm bashing the fandom.
<RAWRity> don't get me started on the whole New Lunar Republic crap.
<richfiles> Quick_Thinker is quick: :$ Beat me to it! :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Anger!
<Dark92Enigma> OH, EARTH........I CALL THEE EARTH
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Youtube commentators in a nutshell
<ShadowReaper898> This Land!
<otakon> Pale_Horse: it's a kind of natural magic
<SpadeMagnes[R]> ALL THE NAMES ARE DUMB
<Reikim> NLR started out of a vaguely catchy song.
<Dark92Enigma> SHAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
<Rookeealding> got to try that on a board once.. Eariler than first
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim well deal with it cause you will find that in every fandom
<Ghosties> 04Dat breeze
<tSparx> "And we shall call it, 'This Land.'"
<Mozdoc> Planted her flag first? So Pinkie arrived before she actually arrived!
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ah
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The level 85 dungeon
<Flootahshy> SpadeMagnes[R]: ALL, the names?
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: True, so true.
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: k. No hard feelings, I hope.
<pony_300> earth ponies travel across the earth to come upon earth. YO DAWG.
<Dark92Enigma> 9000 YEARS DUNGEON
<Ponies47> So my dad found out I was going to Canterlot Gardens. His reaction was just like. Nothing at all
<twilight_sprinkle> i vote for HELL
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah....a lot of the fandom I stay away from. Most of it actually
<Quick_Thinker> so does clover predate starswerl?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim just enjoy the things you like and leave the others enjoy what they want
<Elit3xPon3> i vote for calm
<Dark92Enigma> IT IS ON
<AlienWarhead> Prepare the megaspells
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Sorry, I'm just...I've been having issues with my co-author.
<otakon> I mean I would like to see more characterization of Celestia and Luna tbh
<Pale_Horse> I've always thought Earth ponies would make good Druids and Geomancers.
<otakon> but it'll probably never happen
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S THE WINDIGOS
<XylemTube> Aaaaaaand NOW it's russia
<Nyst> Assuming the tale is a simplification, we can extrapolate that they explored in all directions, but found no fertile land anywhere else but one spot.
<NocturnalBlade> dem Windagos
<Benickerson> dun dun duuunnn
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So where the fuck did the Windigos go anyway?
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Nothing personal, sorry. On another day, another time, I might read it. But there are other things keeping me from doing so.
<richfiles> Avoid the pink cloud! :O
<otakon> GET ON WITH!
<Rex_Mundi> And then Tirak attacked
*Dark92Enigma GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Spectrum_Rush> GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!
<TheRandomkid321> GET ONE WITH IT!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> GET ON WITH IT
<Ravebrony> MOVE ON
<cowvarkian> SpadeMagnes[R]: it's all just a legend
<Rookeealding> ablibing much spike?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim i know you told me your co-aouthor want you to do stuff you don't agree then told him so and stop whinning about it
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: the mountains
<Benickerson> we get it move on!
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: the twilight character killed them with flame
<Flootahshy> YES GETON WITH IT!!!!!!!
<AlienWarhead> Pale_Horse maybe warriors because they are strong workers
<Elit3xPon3> YES GET ON WITH IT
<Applechip> Dovashy cast master level blizzard spell
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also it bothers me that everyone has to be happy and friendly or else shit like this happens
<Mozdoc> Ponies have a hellish life. Think about it, basically it boils down to this: "Live together and be friends with each other, OR DIE AND FREEEEEEEEZE."
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: No, it's just...agh, I can't understand.
<Dark92Enigma> Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet OOOOOOOOOOOOOON WITH OIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim btw i'm not forcing you to read it
<Reikim> Or explain.
<Elit3xPon3> dat voice
<Flootahshy> *Cheers and Yells*
<Quick_Thinker> they didnt search medium
<wirisme1989> ah free will
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I know, and for that, I thank you.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Reikim> I can't
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: well not really but being openly hostile to everyone will do it
<Quick_Thinker> SEARCH MEDIUM HEIGHT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so much kvetching
<Reikim> Argh
<Reikim> My head is SO fucked up right now.
<AJIsAwesome> Mozdoc: But it emphasizes the moral of friendship.
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: It's more like everyone has to get along.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim take a break and stop thinking about it
<pony_300> Here I am! Rock you like a Rainbow Dash!
<wirisme1989> or else
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Not to mention a simple argument of two foals can set a god of chaos free <.<
<AlienWarhead> Mozdoc At least war doesn't work there
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim now watch ponies
<otakon> TOM'S GRANDDAD!
<Quick_Thinker> why does a captain bring a private for a mission like this? I would bring a general or sargent
<otakon> REGINALD
<Reikim> Sorry, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. I really went past the line of courteousy there. I try to avoid getting like that as much as possible. Sorry again, it's not supposed to happen.
<Dark92Enigma> A ROCK? THAT'S MY DESTINY!?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> you like rocks dont you rarity?
<TheKatPony> oh tom
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: Commander
<spitfirecolt> thios is before discord
<Elit3xPon3> TOM
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Apology cookie?
<Quick_Thinker> whatever
<TovlerTheClever> Don't go around baROCK Obama
<Dark92Enigma> OHAI TOM
<Sumica> 00,10you know I think pinkie is just trolling
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: Well, +1 foal and you have the Ssn 2 premiere...
<otakon> spitfirecolt: yeah he came later
<Rustymeat> losers woopers
<otakon> Sumica: I love Pinkie in this ep
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R] to be fair Discord should have locked in a vault or tossed into the ocean
<CrimsonPhoenix> finders keepers losers weepers~
<Quick_Thinker> a rock
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim no need to apology because that was an statment not meant to anyone directly
<Quick_Thinker> a roick
<Reikim> No, really
<Rookeealding> So the time line for this show... this episode is before the princesses and Discord?
<Dark92Enigma> DO YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING
<TheKatPony> pinkie the troll, i like that
<cowvarkian> or both, AlienWarhead
<Quick_Thinker> a rock
<Mozdoc> Pinkie proves that boundaries are insignificant.
<Reikim> I was a bloody hypocrite
<spitfirecolt> yep
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea... having the god of chaos available for ALL to see was a stupid idea
<Midnight_Fyre> It would actually be better if Rarity hadn't mentioned jewels in the rock. It would really emphasize that they are just fighting over a simple rock
<thelonepony> they'll fight for tom
<Ravebrony> CRY some Moar!! :[
<Reikim> I bitch about the way the fandom can get retarded and then I mirror them.
<XylemTube> this is DEFINITELY Russia. All we need now is mass insurance fraud.
<Dark92Enigma> THIS IS ARGUING!!!!!!!!!!!
<Pale_Horse> Well Excuuuuuuuse ME Princess... :|
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Use Ice Heal!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hehe like everyone at times
<Dark92Enigma> WE WERE FROZEN TODAY
<cowvarkian> ikr Pale_Horse
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: It makes me wonder how many gods of chaos there ARE in this world
<Reikim> Apologies to everyone here.
<TheKatPony> annnd they froze
<Quick_Thinker> well shit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Did anyone bring ice heals?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pinkie Scrunchy face
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Reikim> Unrelated: complete d'awwww moment coming up.
<tSparx> *fireball*
<otakon> eeyup
<Malk> Ponies will be ponies
<Quick_Thinker> so does clover predate starswerl?
<Nyst> Interesting. The unicorns wanted the mineral wealth. Like the caves under Canterlot. The earth ponies played a game of provocation. And it was the pegasi (not unexpectedly) that took the first agressive steps.
<Dken2021> it happens to the best of us sometimes
<Dark92Enigma> Well excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me princess
<otakon> Windigoes
<Rookeealding> So in the play... did they just stand still for the rest of the play?
<AlienWarhead> What kill the dinoponies THE ICE AGE
<Benickerson> this is one heck of a play!
<Dark92Enigma> WINDIGOS
<fluttercry> 05,15I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<twilight_sprinkle> windigos would live it in our world
<TovlerTheClever> Use Flame Wheel to thaw out of the ice
<twilight_sprinkle> *love it
<Elit3xPon3> kingdom hearts logo
<Elit3xPon3> incoming
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So yea the moral is be friends and nice OR ELSE
<otakon> incoming LITERAL Crowning Moment of Heartwarming
<XylemTube> Fluttershy can fly..... Just saying
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And then they all froze to death
<AJIsAwesome> TovlerTheClever: :D
<RAWRity> on a lighter note, have this image in your brain now: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/557308_10151268444185802_54695396_n.jpg
<Quick_Thinker> I CHOOOSE YOUR CHARAZARD USE FLAME THROWER
<Malk> WE NEED HUGS TO SAVE EQUESTRIA
<tSparx> Rookeealding: They probably wore an ice mask
<Ponies47> Scoot-Scootaloo: The End
<Mozdoc> Fluttershy's scared of flying, remember?
<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaaaawww
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also i accomplished my cuota of talk here for the time being- Back to lurking
<Rex_Mundi> Twilight gets some of the sappiest lines
<TovlerTheClever> Fluttershy is best hater.
<Ponies47> All da wub <3
<twilight_sprinkle> ironic, fluttershy is the only one who expresses severe dislike
<Midnight_Fyre> Where I come from Windigos are called lake effect snow :)
<wirisme1989> stop hating each other or die!
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: no the moral is to it's easier to get along by working TOGETHER than forcing others to do stuff
<Reikim> Pffft
<Elit3xPon3> the music makes me sad
*Reikim snerks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity not sure if i love you or i hate you
<Quick_Thinker> i love you girls as we die
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: Almost like it's a progressive value that all the nations of the earth need to bond together to solve humanity's problems...
<AlienWarhead> THE POWERPUFF GIRLS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I KNOW NOW KINGDOM HEARTS...IS FRIENDSHIP!
<Dark92Enigma> WE WERE UNFROZEN TODAY
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> KINGDOM HEARTS!!!
<Quick_Thinker> that takes some damn guts to say
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> maybe both
<TovlerTheClever> Remember when Charizard was frozen? It was why he began to obey Ash.
<twilight_sprinkle> so yeah, friendship is nice, but giant pillars of flame are better
<XylemTube> Why didn't FLuttershy Fly to avoid the Ice
<Madfish> Magic flamethrower... OF LOVE!
<otakon> As Charlie Chaplain said "You do not hate, only the unloved and the unnatural hate"
<Dark92Enigma> TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER
<Elit3xPon3> KINGDOM HEARTS YEAH
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Reikim> Remember kids: Friendship is Magic.
<Reikim> Literally.
<RAWRity> this one too while we're at it http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/378200_10151268049575802_1352910361_n.jpg
<Ravebrony> ;d
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That has to be THE SAPPIEST thing I ever heard
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat was cheesy
<Ravebrony> *:d
<Sumica> 00,10and no one called deus ex machenia that time
<wirisme1989> screw the other guys
<Pale_Horse> Unicorns are OP. Nerf Now Plz... :(
<otakon> XylemTube: bc the air around them was freezing
<tSparx> KINGDOM HEARTS
<Malk> tSparx yay that will happen when we are willing to become economically equal with the world I dont think most of us could accept that
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And then heartless decended on the land
<cowvarkian> oh, yeah, deus ex machina
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k i love you :p
<TovlerTheClever> we're together DRAWN TOGETHER /title drop
<pony_300> moral of the story; don't hate, or windigos will fuck you up
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And then they all died
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: But it's useful, right?
<otakon> Pale_Horse: THIS IS NOT ME3 NO NERFING
<Quick_Thinker> so in other words AJ Fluttershy and Twi are the most loving
<twilight_sprinkle> flamethrower=friendship
<Reikim> You magnificent bastard, RAWRity
<Elit3xPon3> the fire of friendship lives in our hearts!
<Reikim> Nobody toes the line like you.
<AlienWarhead> Sumica ponies do Deus ex machina better
<Quick_Thinker> of all the ponies
<Dark92Enigma> Deus-Heart-Machina
<Dken2021> RAWRity as usual , your picture sharing is funny
<Polydunami> Goodness, every single time Twilight's eyes glow pure white... Yeesh, that is creepy :S
<twilight_sprinkle> and yes,pyro=friendship
<Ponies47> : D
<fluttercry> 05,15and once again, RD was proven to be the worst pony
<AlienWarhead> yay
<fluttercry> 05,15the end
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So when the fuck did Celestia,Luna and Discord show up?
<pony_300> except on the internet. Internet's hate laughs at the windigos
<twilight_sprinkle> and now awesome song
<Spectrum_Rush> song time
<Dark92Enigma> AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE!
<Quick_Thinker> SONG TIME
<Elit3xPon3> SONG
<Sumica> 00,10when they made the flag SpadeMagnes[R]
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: RD is best pony
<Reikim> I remember the first time I saw this ep.
<Quick_Thinker> YAY
*Ponies47 Sings along
<TovlerTheClever> must've been hard to do a proper Spike voice and not sound like the Mayor
<tSparx> Malk: I'm not gonna get all up in Poli-Sci International Relations, I'm just sayin' that Lauren Faust isn't exactly a Tea-Partier (not that there's anything wrong with that)
<wirisme1989> And that's how i got my cutie mark
<twilight_sprinkle> and btw fluttershy is worst pony.
<Rosfox> <3 this song
<Rex_Mundi> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo

<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaw <3
<Quick_Thinker> national athem according to the wiki
<Nyst> This isn't a bad song but...it never stuck in my head like all the other songs.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: It's a kid show.:D

<Quick_Thinker> national athem according to the wiki
<Midnight_Fyre> This song is too damn short
<twilight_sprinkle> i wish that song were longer
<AlienWarhead> Nyst not long enough
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ever episode I watch makes Ponyville less and less a fun place to live
<tSparx> Malk: THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP, DUH!
<Mozdoc> Derpy...
<Ghosties> 04My god, that big buck toothed pony back there
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> http://www.derpibooru.org/2704?scope=scpee8fe1a7fc9e77787699d06771b464b2a3cdd77cb
<Jigglysaint> anybody else crying right now?
<RAWRity> true, this definitely fucked up a good deal of Equestria Founding fics
<otakon> Reikim: well doesn't explain the RPS so no idea tbh
<AJIsAwesome> This is my SECOND favorite song of the series.
<Reikim> otakon: RPS?
<twilight_sprinkle> FIGHT
<Ponies47> Jigglysaint: Nope
<Mozdoc> So...wait, the window was open ALL this time?
*Dark92Enigma ZUUUUUUUUUUUUL MOTHERFUCKER, ZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Jigglysaint> blah
<otakon> Royal Pony Sisters
<Reikim> Well, what we have to see here is
<RAWRity> royal pony sisters
<Everlasting_Joy> Ghosties: I think those were goofy teeth, I think they were fooling around.
<otakon> Celestia and Luna
<Malk> tSparx so the mass murder of half of all the ponies didnt have anything to do with it?
<twilight_sprinkle> teeheehee
<Dark92Enigma> THank you!
<CrazyHippie> Hi everypony!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> KINGDOM HEARTS!
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi CrazyHippie
<Rex_Mundi> What Windegos are somewhat based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo
<AJIsAwesome> CrazyHippie: Hello!
<Dark92Enigma> ZUUL DOGS! ALWAYS WORKS
<Ghosties> 04Alright, I'm out everyone. Have a good night, hope you enjoyed the show!!
<tSparx> Malk: What makes you think they mass murdered half the pony pop? What!?
<pony_300> wait, so.... mindfuck ending?
<AlienWarhead> ha ha ha evil ice spirits that feed off hate
<Quick_Thinker> i just noticed fluttershy was aruging.. usually shes quiet
<Reikim> Let's say we assume that the basics of this story are true.
<Obsidian> Night Ghosties
<Rustymeat> bye ghosties
<CrazyHippie> HUgs to twilight_sprinkle and AJIsAwesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> well that was fun
<tSparx> cya Ghosties !
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Ghosties
<NocturnalBlade> nite Ghosties
<Rookeealding> bye Ghosties
<Quick_Thinker> night Ghosties
<AJIsAwesome> Hmmm, I wonder how long that heart's been there.
<Elit3xPon3> so what next
<Benickerson> Bye
<Elit3xPon3> bye
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: Bye!
<Polydunami> See you Ghosties
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So would that make the windigoes invinceble by feeding off trolls?
<wirisme1989> moar
<DaringDerpy> so they ate all their people?
<spitfirecolt> yep
<Malk> tSparx by their references of this big war they never explain
<Quick_Thinker> damnit done
<Reikim> First thing it does to the timeline: Equestria was founded during some sort of period where the Princesses aren't present.
<RAWRity> the biggest thing it establishes is that Equestria wasn't founded by Celestia and Luna
<Ponies47> Later Gho....
<Reikim> ^ Exactly.
<tSparx> Malk: That's not in the show! That's in like a fan video xD
*SpadeMagnes[R] moves like jagger
<Dark92Enigma> Ghosties, out of curiosiry.....what happened to Hipster_Brony?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YOURE BANNED
<TovlerTheClever> Well, that was a nice movie night, I guess.
<otakon> thanks for the movies Sumica!
<Kandarihu> I'd like to apologize for my attitude regarding the B-Movie.
<Kirusaki_Pony> ETF IS THIS
<Ponies47> Oh this! :D
<wirisme1989> what the
<Elit3xPon3> LOLOLOL
<tSparx> Malk: Unless we're talking about something I've missed out on...
<AlienWarhead> Yes SFM Jagger
<thelonepony> :D
<Reikim> And yet, they are on the flag, but that could be construed as an anachronism as a result of the retelling.
<Kandarihu> It was wrong of me to complain about the manner in which it's presented.
<NocturnalBlade> the rifftrax was funny :D
<Uniison> lolwut
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YOURE BANNED!!!
<Reikim> If it isn't, then that means that they endured as a kind of myth for a while.
<Kirusaki_Pony> DUDE THIS TURNED ME OFF SO MUCH
<Quick_Thinker> like the nether one better
<Malk> tSparx oh I thought that fan thing was part of the actual lore
<Ponies47> Dat dance :P
<RosePetal1> This movie is banned.
<Nyst> Who got banned?
<fluttercry> 05,15and then everyone got banned
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<Midnight_Fyre> Kandarihu: Don't worry about it. Don't mention it and noone will remember
<Reikim> Now, this story may have taken place during one of two periods.
<cowvarkian> ikr fluttercry
<RAWRity> which means there's at least a certain period of time where Equestria wasn't ruled by Alicorns. Opening up a lot of questions on how the government operated before the Duocracy we see now.
<Elit3xPon3> this is disturbing
<Dken2021> ah, dictator leadership, discreatly hidden in a kid's show
<CrazyHippie> Oh no I was banned!
<Everlasting_Joy> I must depart, take care everypony!
<tSparx> Malk: Nah, nah :P It's this parody of the Sisterhoove's ep, but it's not lore-based.
<Reikim> Post-Discord Pre-NM, or Post-NM and Pre-Mane6.
<otakon> well from the looks of things Discord came first
<Elit3xPon3> bye
<Obsidian> Bye Everlasting_Joy
<NocturnalBlade> oh this
<Pale_Horse> Nuuuuuu! I'm banned! :'(
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: you're forgiven.........but i need to watch it, so i could give it a proper judgement
<otakon> then the RPS
<pony_300> christina aguilera ruined that song
<Kandarihu> Midnight_Fyre, well, I cut myself off from the episode that I personally selected,.
<otakon> then NmM
<Reikim> Well of course Discord came first.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Derpeh
<tSparx> Malk: Er, not canon, rather. Not even really fanon :P
<otakon> then just Tia
<AlienWarhead> Goodnight Everlasting_Joy
<Dark92Enigma> DERPY
<richfiles> Dang... I NEED to find my PS3 headset (it works on my Mac.) Now that I'm moved into my apartment, I gotta be careful with these late night Bronystate post shows! :$
<Mozdoc> Derpy!?
<NocturnalBlade> love this vid
<Pale_Horse> Squee!
<Quick_Thinker> derp?
<Reikim> I just said the two timelines it could have happened in.
<XylemTube> Soldier + derpy?
<otakon> Derpy makes best Soldier companion
<Malk> tSparx ok I so there wasnt a war?
<RosePetal1> Hi Derpy.
<Dark92Enigma> OK gotta go after this short

<TheRandomkid321> Ow
<Derpy_Hooves> jesus where are the derpy pings coming from?
<pony_300> lol
<Quick_Thinker> ow
<Benickerson> i dont know what this is but I saw Derpy so its gotta be good
<otakon> ahem hiya DerpyMuffins
<Reikim> If it's Post-Discord Pre-NM, then we can say some BS like the RPS were resting or something after their fight.
<Dark92Enigma> COWBOY BEBOP FTW
<Malk> tSparx I would asume many of them died of starvation though
<RAWRity> Or, another possibility: Celestia and Luna were actually inspired by the two ponies on the flag, or are in fact those symbols given life.
<Ponies47> Hey DerpyMuffins
<tSparx> Malk: At least, not that they've ever mentioned
<Pale_Horse> Poor Rarity
<Phase4> hmmm, not sure which mods are on
<Quick_Thinker> mean old heavy
<otakon> Derpy_Hooves: DerpyMuffins
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Reikim> RAWRity: They defeated Discord.
<AlienWarhead> Wat teh fuk
<Reikim> Or
<Reikim> Dammit stop
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hah
<wirisme1989> lol what is this
<otakon> well Sumica, Nittany, Ghosties
<tSparx> Malk: Yeah, but that doesn't have to do with Celestia & Luna coming to power :)
<TheRandomkid321> Lol
<Midnight_Fyre> Well, I'm heading for bed. G'night everypony
<Reikim> We'll assume this isn't the case right now.
<RosePetal1> What de fu nk.
<Dark92Enigma> BRONIES ONLY
<Benickerson> bye
<NocturnalBlade> nite Midnight_Fyre
<Elit3xPon3> bronies only
<RosePetal1> Wat de duck Heavy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wut?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ouch
<tSparx> Cya Midnight_
<RosePetal1> Deal with it!
<otakon> hell the Alicorns could have been magically created from Unicorns
<Quick_Thinker> fluttershy in swag glasses?
<Ravebrony> Is good
<TheRandomkid321> Bitch
<Dken2021> hove punch!
<Dark92Enigma> YOUR FACE
<Reikim> Assume that Celestia and Luna actually existed way back when, okay?
<Obsidian> dat Brohoof
<RosePetal1> Flutter SHY.
<Dken2021> *hoove
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: Phase4 was wondering what mods were on
<AlienWarhead> your face is good
<Quick_Thinker> face is good yes
<Reikim> So
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<RAWRity> I dunno, there's no mention of Discord during the play, which would mean that Discord likely came along AFTER Equestria was founded.
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, BerryPunch needs +v
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Playing FIM before its out
<RosePetal1> Theeese good.
<Dark92Enigma> FLUTTER.......PUNCH
<pony_300> FIGHTING IS MAGIC FUCK YEA
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wut
<Quick_Thinker> fihgint is magic XD
<XylemTube> Fighting is Magic?
<Kirusaki_Pony> xD
<Dken2021> ja
<Malk> tSparx well the lack of trust in their leaders that caused starvation would have helped them come to power because of the vacume of any good strong leadership
<Kandarihu> It's the Alpha, I'll bet
<Elit3xPon3> XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K. Done.
<tSparx> rainbow PUNCH
<Dark92Enigma> FIGHTING IS MAGIC FTW
<otakon> RAWRity: probably
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow
<Ravebrony> Lol!!
<Spriggals> So much ponys today...
<Quick_Thinker> pinkie lost shes pissed
<Phase4> thx ^_^
<Reikim> The problem is what happens if HWE takes place post-NM and pre-Mane6.
<Ravebrony> That BG Music! ,3
<Reikim> Where the hell was Tia?
<Kirusaki_Pony> Are they their pimps? ._.
<Ravebrony> *<3
<CrimsonPhoenix> 11:36 and I'm tired as fuck
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How did they even use controlers without fingers?
<tSparx> Malk: I don't think the princesses came to power until after the founding of Equestria
<Pale_Horse> Why DON'T we have a psycho-twilight emoticon on here?
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<Rex_Mundi> Rarities parents theame
<Ravebrony> Yeah
<Malk> Pyro and Pinkie are friends
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: Powerpuff
<Ravebrony> :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I guess that's what you get from working day time
<Dark92Enigma> INSIDE THE CHIMNEY
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R] Magic
<Reikim> We might say that she withdrew from the world due to sadness, but then, it's said in the first episode that she took over sun/moon duty after banishing Luna.
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Fire!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HADOKEN
<Malk> tSparx no but it did lead up to it
<AlienWarhead> Hadoken
<wirisme1989> this is why pinkie always wins
<Quick_Thinker> dun dun dunnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shet
<fluttercry> 05,15faak you
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: Powerpuff's Law: You Don't Need Fingers, let alone thumbs, To Operate Machines
<Elit3xPon3> this is so funny
<RosePetal1> LOL.
<RAWRity> Reikim: I doubt it. Seeing as the Unicorns were raising the sun and the moon, and it's at least implied that Celestia did both Post-NMM, it's say it's at least pre-nmm
<Rex_Mundi> Piny Hooves are magical
<Elit3xPon3> PINKIE SWORE
<RosePetal1> I'm Badass solider.
<Reikim> So for this reason I propose that the HWE tale takes place post-Discord pre-NMM.
<AlienWarhead> Pinkie's fakk you is so cute
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Bonk
<Rex_Mundi> Pony hooves are magical
<SpadeMagnes[R]> STAREDOWN
<RosePetal1> Pinkie you swore.
<wirisme1989> where is that from?
<Reikim> RAWRity: Exactly.
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<otakon> Reikim: not likely
<Malk> Boring
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> letter
<AlienWarhead> Santa Derp
<RosePetal1> You dare throw dat me.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah going to bed now
<Reikim> otakon: Do you not see the logic here because I do.
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Pale_Horse> Dat Earthbound music.
<Dark92Enigma> SANTA DERP CHRIST
<CrimsonPhoenix> talk to ya'll latah
<RAWRity> Personally, I go with the theory that it takes place before Discord
<Mozdoc> I brought you a letter!
<Nyst> They sure do like playing favorites
<RosePetal1> Baldumborat.
<Malk> What is this video called?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Porn?
<Quick_Thinker> i found a OC of a pony in COD Black ops im pleasently surprised
<otakon> Reikim: well explain how Discord came BEFORE the Windigoes
<AlienWarhead> Goodnight CrimsonPhoenix
<Ravebrony> Dat RD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HOO BOY
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> LOL
<Dark92Enigma> What's this video.........TELL ME!!!!!!!!!!
<Elit3xPon3> OMG SCOUT LOL RAINBOW DASH
<Reikim> otakon: ...Why?
<fluttercry> 05,15wut
<RosePetal1> Is theese?
<Ravebrony> o_o
<TheRandomkid321> Lol
<Rustymeat> lol...
<TheRandomkid321> 0_)
<Reikim> Why do I have to prove that?
<otakon> bc that's what you're saying
<Reikim> Uh, yeah.
<Malk> What video called?
<tSparx> So it's almost midnight BronyState time, ja?
<RosePetal1> lol Rainbow Dash wut.
<Dark92Enigma> TELL ME THE NAME OF THE VIDEO?
<pony_300> ROFl you call that fapping!
<Elit3xPon3> HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<RosePetal1> A gun.
<Reikim> Is there a problem with that?
<Mozdoc> And Applejack did nothing.
<tSparx> SMIPNY RULES
<NocturnalBlade> yay medic
<RosePetal1> Guitars.
<otakon> no
<SpadeMagnes[R]> oh boy
<Reikim> Precisely.
<thelonepony> NOOOOOO!!!!!!!
<RosePetal1> Even Medic got something.
<Reikim> So there's no need for me to prove it.
<RAWRity> perhaps, and this is just me talking out of my ass, Discord took over, and some powerful unicorn gave life to the two ponies on the flag, to combat him with the Elements of Harmony.
<Ravebrony> ._.
<RosePetal1> NOO.
<Elit3xPon3> awwwwwwwwwww
<wirisme1989> AAAAAH
<Pale_Horse> O.O
<Rosfox> o-o
*Malk orders pizza expects it here in 30 minutes its Spinage
<Dark92Enigma> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<XylemTube> Eep
<otakon> but I would like to here an explanation how Discord came before the Windigoes
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> LOL
<Mozdoc> But..But...SCOOTALOO!
<XylemTube> psychoshy
<pony_300> my planet needs me
<Elit3xPon3> WHOA FLUTTERSHY
<otakon> I would think the ponies would not like being under the rule of the Spirit of Chaos
<fluttercry> 05,15HA HE SAID IT
<Dark92Enigma> EPIC
<Malk> The earth is round?
<wirisme1989> Haha
<RosePetal1> lol.
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat Hetaliua
<Reikim> RAWRity: I had a headcanon like that once. I thought: "Hey, what if alicorns existed pre-Discord, but then he trashed them, then they took the Elements of Harmony (which exist inside all ponies) and refined them into weapons?"
<Dken2021> hehehe
<NocturnalBlade> Haha
<RosePetal1> HETALAI!
<otakon> and they probably wouldn't have been bothered by the Windigoes
<Dark92Enigma> fluttercry: I WAS FROZEN TODAY! it never gets old
<Kirusaki_Pony> LOL THEY GOT STUCK
<Reikim> "And then the Elements turned Tia and Luna into goddesses to preserve harmony?"
<Dark92Enigma> GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<RosePetal1> We should watch Hetalia.
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Pale_Horse> GET ON WITH IT!!!
<Vordox> Dat monthy Python
<Rex_Mundi> Blizardy
<RosePetal1> GET ON WITH IT!
<CrimsonPhoenix> GET ON WITH IT
<Dark92Enigma> THANK YOU
<Elit3xPon3> YES GET ON WITH IT
<wirisme1989> awesome
<fluttercry> 05,15RABBLE
<Malk> Speak honestly while protecting your chances of reelectioin
<Reikim> otakon: This could have happened generations after. They would have forgotten.
<Dark92Enigma> RADA RADA RADA
<Vordox> HARUMPH
<Quick_Thinker> xd
<fluttercry> 05,15YGOTAS
<otakon> well actually that's a decent headcanon
<tSparx> dat YTOAS
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat abridged
<Reikim> Yeah
<AlienWarhead> lol
<Dark92Enigma> TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER
<Reikim> I thought of writing it.
<otakon> Reikim: I doubt they would just FORGET about Discord
<Malk> RADA RADA RADA tSparx
<Dark92Enigma> GET ON WITH IT
<tSparx> YTAS*
<Dark92Enigma> SAY WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat grinch
<RosePetal1> Really?
<Polydunami> Oh geeze, Grinch xD
<RAWRity> Though then we'd also have to take into account the accuracy of Pony history, and how long ponies can live. As Starswirl the Bearded is mentioned as having lived during the time that Equestria is founded, and Luna's mentioning of him implies she either knew him, or was familiar enough with him from texts to know about the placement of the bells on his clothes.
<otakon> also, since C and L VANQUISHED him
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yahooo forest
<Rosfox> SAY WHAAAAAAA
<Reikim> otakon: We're only a couple generations from forgetting about Hitler.
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<RosePetal1> SAY WHAAA.
<Quick_Thinker> i know heard this somewhere
<Dark92Enigma> OK gotta go
<Elit3xPon3> SAW WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
<Quick_Thinker> but what
<Pale_Horse> You are empirically wrong, Twilight. Nothing is stronger than Chuck Norris... :|
<RosePetal1> Welcome Christmas.
<otakon> C and L vanquished him
<Reikim> RAWRity: That's true.
<Marx> That reminds me. There was this one product on TV I saw, and it was Chuck Norris approved.
<thelonepony> Dan VS!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Fuck yeah Fluffymixer
<Kandarihu> Dat fluffy pony
<Quick_Thinker> ah yeah welcome
<richfiles> FWUFFY! :)
<Dark92Enigma> bye everypony
<Rookeealding> I wish he would post more
<otakon> before L went rogue
<TheRandomkid321> Flufflepuff
<RosePetal1> DAN VS!
<fluttercry> 05,15We need to watch Dan Vs again
<RosePetal1> I love Dan Vs.
<NocturnalBlade> bye sark92
<RosePetal1> It's so funny.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ZUUL
<Rookeealding> It's got a new season too right?
<NocturnalBlade> *dark92
<Dken2021> yes, Dan Vs is a really good show
<Dark92Enigma> ZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL
<otakon> and they showed up after Equestria got founded
<RosePetal1> Season 3.
<otakon> so I think
<RAWRity> Then again, seeing as Twilight herself knew about the bells, it's possible Pony History is accurate going way back, and Luna just has an interest in history.
<thelonepony> FluffyPony is so Adorable!!
<Elit3xPon3> dafuq
<Vordox> Is that the real voice of Dan?
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS IS NOT 12
<Malk> What is this?
<RosePetal1> Rainbow Cupcake.
<CrimsonPhoenix> FOURTEEN
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol
<RosePetal1> Yes, that's his real voice.
<Kandarihu> Hmm, was the voice of Dan taken from an episode?
<Quick_Thinker> jump out the window?
<Rookeealding> He's looking for a VA for Dan
<Quick_Thinker> good plan
<AlienWarhead> Vordox I think so
<thelonepony> Troll
<otakon> Equestria, Discord shows up, RPS show up, NmM shows up, modern day.
<Mozdoc> What's the puffball pony?
<Reikim> Possible, but I think it's more likely that Luna knew about Starswirled.
<Rustymeat> ...
<Nicos> ive seen enough henti
<otakon> troll
<Dark92Enigma> Bye.........ZUUUUUL MOTHERFUCKER ZUUUUUUL...........Save the tip for the maid..............bye
<Marx> :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hehehe
<Rustymeat> LOL
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> YES
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, Beach Boys
<Quick_Thinker> oh fuck
<TheRandomkid321> Trollight Sparkle
<Polydunami> Wait
<RosePetal1> lol.
<otakon> Mozdoc: Flufflepuff
<cowvarkian> hey, I like this song
<RosePetal1> LOL.
<Elit3xPon3> LOL
<richfiles> :$ She's a genius!
<RAWRity> of course, it could be that that episode was just a fun little aesop fable about friendship, and I'm thinking way too hard about this shit.
<RosePetal1> BA BA BA BA
<Reikim> However, RAWRity, on the other hand it's possible that the RPS showed up just after Equestria's founding, before Starswirled died.
<otakon> dat Barbera Ann
<Quick_Thinker> and i no havve an epileptic sezuire YAY
<Polydunami> Dammit this isn't Beach Boys :|
<cowvarkian> brb, gonna get a cupcake
<Reikim> And we enjoy thinking too hard about this, it's part of being a nerd.
<RAWRity> that's also a possibility
<cowvarkian> or two
<otakon> Reikim: true
<AJIsAwesome> Unfortunately, the VA for Dan is on that new show for Nickolodeon, Robot and Monster.:|
<fluttercry> 05,15well I'm gonna go now. later everyone!
<otakon> Reikim: yes it's wonderful isn't it?
<Nyst> Whoa. This music. What is it?
<Obsidian> Bye fluttercry
<Ponies47> Bye fluttercry! :D
<fluttercry> 05,15Later Regulars
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Bye!
<Rookeealding> No I mean the Tumbler is looking for one
<Quick_Thinker> forgot how aweosme this song is
<otakon> night fluttercry sleep well
<Reikim> Anyway, I see the Timeline like this. Because headcanon.
<Dken2021> seeya fluttercry
<Reikim> fluttercry: Night man.
<thelonepony> bai fluttercry
<RosePetal1> Even if it's stupid just remember, Robot Monster is better than Fanboy and ChumChum.
<NocturnalBlade|Away> be back later guys
<AlienWarhead> AJIsAwesome did the VA say he couldn't do Dan vs.
<DrSteveSCARz> Well everypony its been great, but i gtg see ya :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye DrSteveSCARz
<Elit3xPon3> bye
<RAWRity> I'm not dissing it, I'm just thinking it's funny we're spending more time thinking about this than the writers ever did. Because I know damn well they never sat down and tried to set up a timeline for the history of equestria like Tolkein or something.
<HoodyNinja> Hello bronystate!
<richfiles> So what was the first movie and first pony ep? I missed both.
<Klumzeedragon> DrSteveSCARz Cya~
<Ravebrony> Hey HoodyNinja
<Rookeealding> I'm out Everypony!
<AJIsAwesome> AlienWarhead: I'm not sure. I do know he's voicing one of the characters i the show.
<HoodyNinja> How are you fine gents this evening
<twilight_sprinkle> hello HoodyNinja
<Reikim> RAWRity: The irony is what makes it fun.
<thelonepony> hai HoodyNinja
<Polydunami> Oh hey HoodyNinja
<Klumzeedragon> And Im back. With chilli! :D
<AlienWarhead> bye DrSteveSCARZ
<Reikim> Gotta love this fandom, sometimes.
<Reikim> Anyway
<thelonepony> Wb
<Quick_Thinker> im going to guess double dragon theme
<otakon> anyway
<otakon> wayany
<Quick_Thinker> why... hell if i know
<Klumzeedragon> Thanks thelonepony. :D
<otakon> ayaywn
<Dken2021> part of a beinga fan, we think more than the producers themselves, and go way extreme with tons of theories
<RosePetal1> You missed all of it.
<AlienWarhead> go sumica pony
<pony_300> definitely not dd
<Reikim> Great Alicorn Empire > Discord > Celestia and Luna > Celestia and Luna withdraw from the world due to some BS like a policy of non-interference > Equestria founded > C and L re-enter out of curiosity or some BS > Luna gets jealous, NMM born > Celestia rules for a thousand years > Mane6.
<Quick_Thinker> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is pretty obscure
<Pale_Horse> What PMV is this?
<RosePetal1> Green pony is rocking.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Is this Apples.Life or someting?
<otakon> Reikim: doable actually
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy
<Reikim> Behold my headcanon.
<wirisme1989> WHAT
<otakon> Saturn loves this one
<otakon> lol
<Kandarihu> DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE
<pony_300> lol I remember this
<Marx> ...Wow.
<Rustymeat> DAT FLOPPY
<otakon> I love the pop ups
<Quick_Thinker> damn
<Vordox> XD
<Reikim> Look upon my headcanon, ye fanboys, and despair.
<Elit3xPon3> FLOPPY DISK
<Vordox> So MUCH FLOPPIS
<otakon> I'm beholding it
<Kandarihu> Those are Floppy Drives, right?
<Mozdoc> Wait...the floppy disks are the colors of the ponies whose phrases are on them.
<otakon> and honestly it could work
<Vordox> Mozdoc: Quality
<Nyst> I like the customized one.
<Quick_Thinker> BRAVO BRAVO that probely took over 4 weeks to get sup
<richfiles> FLOPPY.PIE is cutest floppy drive! :O
<Marx> So is harddrive music a new meme or something?
<pony_300> the hook to this son sounds good even when played through undulating hard drives
<Kandarihu> Mozdoc, I see.
<Elit3xPon3> new music
<AlienWarhead> If a broken Dalek tried to sing my little pony
<wirisme1989> HOW
<Reikim> Possible contingent theory: Celestia partially planned for the Mane6.
<Malk> Who did this I love them
<richfiles> FLOPPY drive, not hard drive
<Rex_Mundi> I remember floppy discs that were actually floppy
<Dken2021> I wonder, what if -and bare with me- what if all the generations are all connected someway?
<Vordox> richfiles: <.< Are you not seeing the FLoppy Discs?
<RosePetal1> GENIUS!
<pony_300> rightright, -5 nerd points
<Reikim> Perhaps she had the option of neutralizing NMM completely and held back because LOVE.
<RAWRity> Meh, I personally go >Equestria founded >Discord >RPS show up >Discord Beaten >RPS Rule >NMM happens >Celestia rules for 1000 year >Mane 6
<Nyst> It runs Doom II at max settings!
<AlienWarhead> Marx I think only one guy does it I'm not sure
<Reikim> Works too.
<Quick_Thinker> and yes they are called FLOPPy drives not hard drives, its just a term that wont die out
<pony_2366> Wow
<tSparx> Marx It's actually an old meme, they did this even back when floppies were new. Just didn't get around much because, y'know, no internet
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 Tirek returns
<richfiles> Was replying to Marx, who called them hard drives
<Reikim> Anyway
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder how this is programmed
<Reikim> ANYWAY
<HoodyNinja[games]> Okay then
<Kandarihu> Just when I was getting tired of this song, FLOPPY DRIVE MIX
<RAWRity> Dken2021: I'm sure there are folks who have come up with stuff like apocalypse/evolution to try and connect them.
<twilight_sprinkle> i bet saturn would know
<HoodyNinja[games]> Thats happening
<otakon> RAWRity: that's what I was thinking
<Sumica> 00,10just a midi controler
<Reikim> I wonder how much Celestia planned for the Mane6.
<Pale_Horse> I suddnly want to play Lake Odell and Oregon Trail all over again. :P
<otakon> Dken2021: O_o
<Dken2021> RAWRity exactly
<otakon> Reikim: a lot maybe
<Nyst> There's software you can download to do this yourself. It's an easy to pick up hobby.
<Marx> richfiles. Oh yeah, that makes more sense.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sumica: American version?
<Quick_Thinker> have fun on the oregon trail
<Tovler> I remember floppy disks and diskettes
<Reikim> Also I'm not going to bare with you, that's just weird.
<Kandarihu> I notice that one is colored pink with Pinkie Pie's cutie mark.
<F1uttershy> Um hello, everpony
<AlienWarhead> I want a Pinkie Pie floppy drive
*twilight_sprinkle googles what a midi controlelr is
<wirisme1989> i miss floppy disks
<Obsidian> Hello F1uttershy
<Dken2021> it is, and seems like a lot of thinking anyway
<Malk> tSparx shall we start a debate decussing time history politics philosphy and ponies?
<Klumzeedragon> F1uttershy: Howdy!
<Reikim> So let's say that Celestia had the option of taking out NMM for good and held back.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i see no one got it
<RAWRity> I know she at least planned for Twilight to make friends to beat NMM. The question is whether she did this because she didn't have the power to beat NMM herself, or knew that Twilight doing it would turn NMM back to Luna rather than just imprisoning her.
<Reikim> Why? She loves her sister.
<Reikim> And
<Quick_Thinker> i paintd and skinned my labtop to havve Twilight Sparkle cover and all kinds of other shit on it
<F1uttershy> thats great really
<Malk> discussing tSparx
<pony_300> I miss when floppy disks were actually floppy
<Marx> Awesome.
<Reikim> Perhaps the whole bit about Nightmare Moon was a gambit to salvage her sister.
<Pale_Horse> Don't knock floppy disks. They're more powerful than people think. They once stored Optimus Prime's personality on one. :D
<Rustymeat> YES
<CrimsonPhoenix> AHM BLUE
<Rustymeat> YES
<Elit3xPon3> that was awesome
<XylemTube> YES
<F1uttershy> Yay
<Tovler> :( I used diskettes in 2005 even though everyone else was using USB.
<Reikim> You have to wonder why, exactly, she ended up disconnected from the Elements.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DA BA DEE DA BA DAI
<Spectrum_Rush> dabuu dee
<Malk> Im a beat of
<otakon> RAWRity: I think Celestia COULDN'T use the Elements at full power and using them as they did kind of de-powered them
<richfiles> This was SUPER easy to do on Commodore 1541 Floppy drives. Due to how simple the computers were back then, the Floppy Drive actually had it's own dedicated CPU, RAM, and ROM, in essence, it was a stand alone computer, and you could certainly hack it to play music! :)
<Elit3xPon3> OMG what pmv or whatever is this?
<Tovler> Now we have SD cards with 32 gigs
<otakon> that's why she was only able to banish her
<XylemTube> BLUE
<tSparx> Malk: LORD no. I'm a still a little buzzed, very content to sit here, listen to tunes, finish reading my novel.
<Quick_Thinker> um pony_300 the reason they arent floppy anymore is becuase its legacy tech so its entirely useless
<otakon> I think
<Polydunami> This is Blue by Eiffel 65
<AlienWarhead> shouldn't rainbow be in the blue pony video
<RosePetal1> LOL.
<XylemTube> IM IN NEED OF A DIME
<Reikim> Perhaps it was the conflict between the two sisters - I believe it's said that Luna/Celestia used to be co-wielders?
<Mozdoc> I bought a USB floppy drive for one of my older laptops that didn't have floppy installed on it because I figured there'd be a situation where one would be needed.
<Polydunami> Well, more like a ponified remix of Blue
<F1uttershy> :( um i like it very much
<otakon> yeah
<Pale_Horse> Pinkie isn't Blue... She's obviously pink! She's trying to confuse me... :|
<Ravebrony> You know, i didnt really like this PMV at the start ,but it grew on me :D
<RAWRity> otakon: true. And I go with that. Otherwise I have to question Celestia's judgment in risking 1000 years of Darkness because she wanted her sister back.
<Malk> tSparx mabye some other time for fun what you reading?
<Reikim> Either that or Celestia intenionally DC'd herself.
<otakon> they did use the EoH to imprison Discord
<RAWRity> Well, Celestia was at least connected to the EoH during the 1000 years, even if she couldn't use their full power.
<Reikim> RAWRity: They were co-wielders, so it's possible that their infighting depowered the Elements somehow, or Celestia just couldn't use them at full power on her own.
<otakon> I'm pretty sure Tia wasn't in harmony when she had to face her sister
<HoodyNinja[games]> Oh what is this song!
<twilight_sprinkle> creepy shiz
<tSparx> Malk: Yarborough by B.H. Friedman. I'm 40 pages from the end and still don't know how to describe what it's about
<wirisme1989> ok this is kinda creepy
<HoodyNinja[games]> I know it from my childhood!
<Elit3xPon3> sounds creepy
<AlienWarhead> Still no Dashie?
<HoodyNinja[games]> YES!
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja[games]: scroll up meng, someone wrote it
<Sumica> 00,10FlutterPie is blue
<RAWRity> Since her being connected to them was what kept Discord imprisoned until after NMM returned
<HoodyNinja[games]> twilight_sprinkle: I remembered the song, nvm :)
<richfiles> Blue, by Eiffel 65
<Reikim> Oh yeah, I forgot that.
<tSparx> HoodyNinja[games]: I'm Blue
<Pale_Horse> Neither of those ponies are blue... :(
<Kandarihu> This is yet another one of these 80s songs.
<F1uttershy> Yay i have glasses
<twilight_sprinkle> im purple
<Moopy> hey what happebed did the stream froze?
<HoodyNinja[games]> Okay, i get it...
<richfiles> Late 90s\
<Reikim> Now, bear with me here, I'm trying to sort something out.
<tSparx> HoodyNinja[games]: (abadee abadye
<RAWRity> the fact that Tia imprisoned her, rather than turning her back to normal, also implies that they weren't at their full power when she used the EoH
<HoodyNinja[games]> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> OPEN GUNDAM STYLE
<Malk> tSparx whats it about?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Hoo boy
<Ravebrony> AW SNAP!!
<Pale_Horse> GANGNAM STYLE!
<Kandarihu> GUNDAM STYLE
<Rustymeat> YES
<RAWRity> OH MY GOD YES GUNDAM STYLE
<Reikim> The validity of this is highly dependant on exactly how much influence you think the Elements have, so bear with me.
<tSparx> This song is from the mid/late 90's, isn't about?
<Nyst> This should be good.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim is not only possible its cannon since the lack of rainbow dash + the discorded weilders in discord ep lead to the elements useless
<Quick_Thinker> wahtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
<tSparx> isn't it*?
<Elit3xPon3> YEAAAAA
<Malk> GUNDAM STYPLE

<RosePetal1> PONIES.
<Reikim> Anyway
<tSparx> Malk: "I'm 40 pages from being done and still don't know how to describe what it's about"
<otakon> Sumica: where's Opony Gangam style?
<Reikim> The Mane6's origins are suspiciously coincidental.
*HoodyNinja[games] must learn korean
<twilight_sprinkle> i swear, every time this song is streamed, ill come up with gory ways to kill it
<RAWRity> whoever saved this video, THANK YOU
<Nyst> Girldams and guydams.
<Kandarihu> Guncannon?
<Malk> tSparx what type of book?
<Reikim> And very convenient.
<Pale_Horse> HEY!
<tSparx> Malk: Novel
<Pale_Horse> HEY!
<otakon> well that's writing for you
<Reikim> Now, there are two forces who may have possibly done this.
<Reikim> BEAR WITH ME
<CrimsonPhoenix> Open GUNDAM STYLE
<Elit3xPon3> i so wanna do this dance
<RosePetal1> GUNDAM STYLE!
<RAWRity> THIS ENTIRE VIDEO IS A REALLY LONG PUN!! :D

<Sumica> 00,10this is why i save videos I like RAWRity
<Mozdoc> The bass!
<F1uttershy> Um.....gang nam style
*otakon bears with Reikim, a grizzly to be exact.
<RAWRity> Sumica: THANK YOU
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT RAWRs Reikim
<Malk> HEY SEXY LADY
<Reikim> Celestia may have done it, but a gut instinct tells me she didn't. It's too chancy. I don't think she was able to predict all of that, goddess or no.
<RAWRity> Sumica: THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.
<RosePetal1> Like a boss.
<tSparx> Malk: I'm sorry, I don't know how to be more specific.
<otakon> O God this video
<Rustymeat> dat ass
<Malk> HEY SEXY LADY
<Elit3xPon3> ass
<tSparx> Malk: It's, very, idk.
<AlienWarhead> There needs to be a Chitty version
<RosePetal1> Hey Sexy Lady.
<Buytoast> oh, open gundam style
<richfiles> I want to ride a pony... Whatcha doin later Twi! :$ XD
<Kandarihu> I notice that all the girls have Zeon's Mobile Suits over their faces, while the guys all have Earth Federation Mobile Suits over their faces.
<otakon> So
<Reikim> The other possibility is that the Elements arranged for it on their own.
<RosePetal1> dat ass.
<RainbowDash90> RRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAWWWWWEEEEEERRRRR!!!!!!!
<Malk> tSparx ok gotcha
<tSparx> Malk: It's abstract, it's deep, it openly defies easy categories.
<otakon> that would make sense
<SaxyPretender> 0,14....YES.
<Dken2021> interesting
<Nyst> This is really well done. Whoever made this paid a lot of attention to small detail.
*twilight_sprinkle ties up the stream and lowers it into a den of hungry spiders
<RosePetal1> I remember Chitty.
<Reikim> They need new wielders, right?
<otakon> yeah
<Pale_Horse> HEY!
<F1uttershy> Why is everyone calling me sexy? :(
<Pale_Horse> HEY!
<Reikim> And they're supposedly the most powerful thing canonically.
<Malk> tSparx like divine comedy?
<Pale_Horse> LISTEN! :D
<otakon> being a basic force in that reality I would say
<RAWRity> hmm, Elements of Harmony being sentient to an extent? I like the idea.
<Reikim> Why wouldn't they be able to arrange the Mane6's existence?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Open GUNDAM STYLE
<SaxyPretender> 0,14OPPAN GANGNAM STYLE
<otakon> not really senitent
<thelonepony> because you are :)
<Reikim> Semi-sentient.

<Malk> I actually realize what this song is about
<Reikim> This ties into my Great Alicorn Empire thing, but I won't get into that now.
<otakon> oh God we've crossed over the fandom lines now
<cowvarkian> sumica id guess
<RosePetal1> eyyyyyyyy.
<Klumzeedragon> That mod spam. :P
<tSparx> Malk: More like Jitterbug Perfume (Tom Robins), or maybe kinda like As I Lay Dying (William Faulkner)
<Spitfire> best part coming right now
<thelonepony> toilet
<twilight_sprinkle> this song couldnt get any monotonous if it tried
<SaxyPretender> 0,14HEEEEEEEY

<otakon> CALL UPON THEM!
<otakon> SOS!
<Elit3xPon3> NNUUUUUUUU
<Obsidian> Thanks for the stream Sumica

<RAWRity> Reikim: the elements may have known that NMM was going to return, and set the Mane 6 up to combat her eventually.
<RosePetal1> Thanks .
<Ninjazz> ba dum tss.
<F1uttershy> wo hoo
<wirisme1989> which gen is this?
<Nyst> Why do they need shoes? Silly seaponies, you have fins!
<Reikim> Either the Elements knew and cared about NMM's return, or Celestia conviniced them to hold back on getting themselves some new Bearers.
<RosePetal1> Gen 1
<Reikim> Yeah!
<wirisme1989> I see
<Elit3xPon3> is that applejack
<cowvarkian> first wirisme1989

<Quick_Thinker> they have the abilities to seperate bubbles apparently
<AlienWarhead> wirisme1989 G1 I think
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: actually my bitching has a lot of variety
<Kawaii_icybeauti> bye bye sumi!!
<Dken2021> otakon plus it be less fun if they planned stuff without us putting any input on it
<Malk> wirisme1989 1 and are you really 1989 years old?
<Elit3xPon3> O_O ive...what?
<Reikim> Perhaps they influenced Celestia as well? That's how Celestia knows to send Twilight to Ponyville.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh yes~
<Pale_Horse> It's Bacon and Applejeck!
<F1uttershy> um.........lolwut?
<wirisme1989> lol
<XylemTube> Gen1 AppleJack
<Tervicz> I wonder if that is the actual size of Gen 4 ponies?
<RAWRity> I'm going with "They knew NMM was going to return and wanted to bring Luna back, to re-establish the Duocracy
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's BACON AND APPLEJACK
<AlienWarhead> yay woah

<Kawaii_icybeauti> awww later Sumi. Thanks for teh stream :)
<Pale_Horse> Mmmm... bacon...
<Reikim> Princess Celestia has such a reputation for manipulating people. But really? She's being used by the Elements.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> The most importan question is: where does Molestia fits in this universe ?
<Sumica> 00,10Twi's mom was a G1 pony
<Reikim> Celestia knows that sending Twilight to Ponyville will fix everything.
<Mozdoc> Wish I knew where to find some of these pictures. I guess I'm just not Brony enough.

<twilight_sprinkle> Kawaii_icybeauti: ive had school for 1.5 weels
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R]: But BronyState time it's November -- I stayed up this late just to do that :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: I personally think it's quiet funny.
<RAWRity> because trust me, Lain is a show that NEVER explains anything. It gives you all the information necessary to understand it, but makes YOU connect the dots.
<HoodyNinja[games]> twilight_sprinkle: 2 here
<Elit3xPon3> yeah!
<Sumica> 00,10it just started for your Scoot-Scootaloo
<Ponies47> TF2 at 39% :3

<Elit3xPon3> i like this song
<Kawaii_icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle: School starts late here in NY, always day after labor day.
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Why so Green Day? :O
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: I just don't know what "desu" means.
<Reikim> They're like...puzzles.
<RAWRity> Reikim: what a coincidence, they're from the same guy!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It's gonna be a long sleep :(

<Sumica> 00,10and you will miss ponies Scoot-Scootaloo
<Reikim> Harmony is a universal force.
<HoodyNinja[games]> My birfdays in September, why would you sleep through that? :(
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: needs more desu
<RAWRity> Chiaki Konaka
<Reikim> Now to diverge a bit.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03EWWW Ponies :|
<Sumica> 00,10cause it starts on the 22
*NullRadix uninstalls league of legends
<Reikim> Gotta look up that guy
<twilight_sprinkle> Kawaii_icybeauti: yeah, my high school used to start 1st of september
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: So it's kind of like Yoda speak?
<NullRadix> there, one less thing that can easily distract me
<RAWRity> NullRadix: that'll give you a good amount of free time back.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I hope theHubTVNetvvork didn't lie >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> Kawaii_icybeauti: university starts earlier, but ends earlier i think
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Stop spreading the evil rumor! :D That's mean!
<Ponies47> Wait so S3 starts the 22ND? O.O
<Reikim> So let's say that, long before ponies as we knew them, there existed Alicorns/.
<Sumica> 00,10but I saw it on EQD
<Kawaii_icybeauti> twilight_sprinkle: what happened? AJIsAwesome I guess you can say that.
<Reikim> As a race.
<cowvarkian> http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/desu
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is this legit?
<Sumica> 00,10EQD is alays right
<HoodyNinja[games]> Sumica: Trolls got through again
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HAH!
<Buytoast> anyone who disagrees with EQD gets banned
<Buytoast> end of rine
<LunarSS> Sumica: That's ture I saw it on the internet on time
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: No. It was from HUBTVNETVVORK
<Rustymeat> ALWAYS
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh it was on EqD? Then it must be true! Everything they say there is true!
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: O_O
<Reikim> And these alicorns eventually create a mighty empire.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kawaii_icybeauti: nothing, i graduated from high school :D
<Buytoast> all glory to our dragon fucking overlord
<Dken2021> I think we shall all see Tom for this
<Reikim> This endures for a while, until Discord shows up.
<Dken2021> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Buytoast> may his dildos forever be lubed
<Reikim> Whether they invited him or not, I don't know.
<HoodyNinja[games]> Buytoast: Amen
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We don't even what the episode is in first place.
<Reikim> Discord exists to destroy Harmony, and he's happy to do so.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh wait, Tom doesn't know, then it must be still unknown...
<Sumica> 00,10I would find it funny as hell if it actaly dose start on the 22
<Reikim> But at the same time, Harmony can destroy Discord. Unfortunately, it's losing.
<HoodyNinja[games]> I would find it awesome
<TheRandomkid321> I need to play some more skyrim. But I ruined my character roleplay... I'll just pretend that didnt happen... yesh... yeah
<Ninjazz> Also, what if Discord wasn't the only Draconicus or whatever they're called.
<HoodyNinja[games]> BACK TO THE GAMEZ!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXhWRlg2QE8&feature=BFa&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw Needs more of this
<Sumica> 00,10yes because tom is also always right
<Reikim> Universal order is going to fall apart.
<NullRadix> RAWRity: it actually isn't the main drain on my free time, but it was roughly the ONLY drain today. I think I'm going to make it a policy that anytime I burn a full day on something I can't "complete", its time to get rid of it
<Sumica> 00,10even when he forgets to be right he is right
<DerpyMuffins> Tom never talks much does he?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Tom has solid proof!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He's a rock
<cowvarkian> bazinga
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Is Tom our Airdate bot?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03He is a stone cold tough as nails kind of bot!
<DerpyMuffins> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Sumica> 00,10tom is chanserv
<Reikim> The last bastion of the Alicorn Empire goes into full-on desperate mode and begins trying to exploit Harmony to combat Discord.
<cowvarkian> chanserv is best serv
<Sumica> 00,10that reminds me
<Reikim> They eventually succeed in isolating three Elements that together make up Harmony.
<Sumica> 00,10:kickbot 6 9
<BerryPunch> Sumica: Setting kickbot to 6 messages in 9 seconds
<Reikim> *six
<TheRandomkid321> I'm so happy I have an AJ toy... THey didn't have fluttershy though the wankers.
<Reikim> They then go about refining these six until they come up with the Elements.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03lolol 69 lololol
<RAWRity> ...oh my god http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/423882_489715674381447_1863469047_n.jpg

<PillowPoni|Drawings> http://derpy.me/Q8HD2
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You silly, silly filly~
<Reikim> And then these Elements are given to Luna and Celestia, two young alicorns, as the best potential alicorns.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Berry Punch is too drunk to fraction.
<Sumica> 00,10:kickbot make me a sanwich
<BerryPunch> Sumica: Not a valid command, silly

<RAWRity> and then all the Alicorns died the end
<Sumica> 00,10prince-dari, bring back steven magnet
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That's right BerryPunch, you are a strong, independant purple mare who don't need no man~
<Reikim> In order to preserve Harmony, the Elements then decide to make Luna and Celestia into goddesses.
<DerpyMuffins> BerryPunch is the town drunk
<Reikim> All the other alicorns are dead at this point, yes.
<Elit3xPon3> lol
<Reikim> So Luna and Celestia fix up the world a bit, and create the three pony races. Hell if I know why.
<prince-dari> Bring back Steven? Hah
<Dken2021> oh god steven magnet
<Sumica> 00,10doooooooo eeeeeet

<richfiles> Pinkie Pie's location and activities are always known... She's always so full of cookies! :O
<Petrified_Discord> The top of my TV is rounded, so I had to tape my sensor bar too :D
<MirrorImage> PROTIP: Duck tape works *GREAT* for killing stinkflies

<kirzstryfe> so how did you all like my movie pick? :3
<RAWRity> After al, within the Bronies we've got the cloppers, the NLR members, the Solar Empire supporters. Those who are and aren't for grimdark/shipping/grimshipping. Not to mention the digital artists, teh traditional artists, the EDM musicians versus the more traditional musicians. Those who like S1 and not S2. all kinds of stuff.
<Dken2021> ohai kirzstryfe

<Reikim> Anyway, cultures within cultures.
<Buytoast> BAD

<Petrified_Discord> ...Why does that look so weird? XD
<LunarSS> What the actual fuck
<Reikim> By the way kirz, I can't get on Stormbluff.

<Reikim> I was on no less than three different times.

<MirrorImage> My Little Hamtaro?
<Reikim> In the fanfic world...there is everything.
<Petrified_Discord> MirrorImage: ...Not sure if want :/
<MirrorImage> agreed
<Reikim> In the music there's every genre.
<Polydunami> Better question is, Why the hell am I not creeped out by that, Rex_Mundi? :S
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hated this misison
<Ninjazz> So someone actually hates Lesson Zero? One of the more recommended episodes?
<kirz|GW2> Meanwhile's gonna flip if we go to Fissure of Woe
<Reikim> Jeez, we are a nation cut in half.
<Reikim> Why, kirz?
<Polydunami> DO IT FASTER
<kirz|GW2> because I got him to move to stormbluff from there in the first place
<MirrorImage> yes, some Elbow Grease would do lovely for this
<MirrorImage> especially if it's highly flammable
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You didnt destroy all the boxes, ILL PLACE MORE
<Dken2021> well at least you don't lose a life if you lose
<CiderIsForDrinking> Hey everypony, who's streaming?
<Petrified_Discord> Elbow Grease is highly flammable

<Mozdoc> Wow, that's harsh.
<RAWRity> Pegacorn HATED lesson zero, so much that he left the fandom for a while after it
<adasdad> rofl
<Mozdoc> You almost had it.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NOOOOOOO

<MirrorImage> Miyamoto did, apparently
<adasdad> ungrteful robot
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony! :)
<Reikim> Huh, that's a new one.
<RAWRity> only to come back so he could complain about it.
<Petrified_Discord> "Well maybe I could destroy them all if you STOPPED REBUILDING THEM!"
<Reikim> Ergh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo ^_^
<Polydunami> Hi! I'm a robot! I have meters for eyes!
<Reikim> Honestly, I can't put up with that.
<Biglaw> YAAAAY
<adasdad> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Biglaw> Moo
<Reikim> Sure, you might hate an episode.
<Mozdoc> Fucking bad ass.
<Reikim> But there's not reason to go whining about it.
<Petrified_Discord> Moo moo, son. Moo moo.
<Dken2021> huh, never did that strategy before
<kirz|GW2> well shit, both of the movies I had in the tube have been picked for the lottery lately >.<
*Reikim is being hypocritical again, but the point stands

<Reikim> Worst Episode convos are, as I have stated, just as annoying as Best Pony convos.
<richfiles> Congratulations on BURNINATING like a machine. I am going to sit around on my fat wheels like a lazy organic unit and watch you
<Reikim> Vote Nudist Colony of the Dead for B.
<RAWRity> might I suggest...Nudist Colon of the Dead?
<Reikim> I want to see this.
<Ninjazz> Still Jackiechan.jpg.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What pisses me off is the guy complains that there is so much junk yet if you fail he keeps replacing more shit
<kirz|GW2> I can't get B for a month anyways

<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is everyone's favorite galaxy in this game?
<Tyler_The_creator> Aw. I was hoping to watch a bad movie.

<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: bye!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I like Throwback

<cachi01|phone> Bye RAWRity!
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: All of them.
<Tyler_The_creator> yow
<Tyler_The_creator> ya
<Polydunami> I can't believe I never used a guide for any part of this game :S
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I do like the beat the wii mote makes in these sections
<Reikim> Also, if someone (say, Shizu) can explain the techspeak in here: https://xkcd.com/1084/
<BerryPunch> Title on xkcd.com: xkcd: Server Problem
<Reikim> Except for the Singularity, I know all about that.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> schindler's list is my pick for A

<SpadeMagnes[R]> The beatblock double speed isnt hard but it can get ridiculace
<Phase4> Reikim, he fucked up
<Phase4> like real bad
<Ponies47> MvM anypony? :P
<Reikim> How bad we talking?

<Phase4> if you were to break everything
<Phase4> and your computer exploded
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Ponies47: When this is finished downloading, which should be in a few minutes.
<Phase4> the error would be less wrong than that one
<Reikim> Okay
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> And after I get used to controls again
<Reikim> So what did he do?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whoops we missed one
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah cool Mario Galaxy oh how was D-War? was it bad?:D
<Polydunami> Again, Rex_Mundi; I'm not creeped out at all :3
<Dken2021> Sketch_Toku_Brony I guess it was
<Rex_Mundi> Polydunami: Good, because its good art. Why get creeped out?
<Polydunami> Also, dat big ol' Spike in the bg :3
<NocturnalBlade|Away> Ponies47: i told mirror this, just please be patient and i'll join soon
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> Gaah, this thing keeps going from 10 minutes to 30 minutes and all
<Phase4> the ls.jar bit is simple enough, he somehow got /use/shar/Adobe/doc/example/android_vm/root/sbin/ in the path and searching for .jar's
<Buytoast> you'll never find that green star
<Ponies47> NocturnalBlade|Away: Okie :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he went full retard.
<PillowPoni|Minecraft> OH god now it says an hour. *facedesks* You guys go on without me, I'll be fine~
<NocturnalBlade|Away> ^_^
<twilight_sprinkle> yiffie!
<Buytoast> your life will fade away as you struggle for completion
<Phase4> thats not actually all that simple, its entirely possible to make jar's executible (binfmt_misc) but its searching for .jar thats dificult
<Polydunami> Not even for the green stars did I use a guide
<Reikim> I don't understand
<Buytoast> only finding a cruel void of failure
<Polydunami> ALthough it was a pain in the ass to find some of them
<richfiles> Traveling Galaxies... WORLD map... Seems legit!
<richfiles> :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> who's playing? SB64?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I got almost all the starts pretty fast
<Phase4> 'device is not responding' is very dependant on the device and is the 'you fucked up bad' error code
<NocturnalBlade|Away> PillowPoni|Minecraft: dont worry, it will happen ^_^
<pony43810> #brony
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *stars

<Wrek> 05i can earn hopefulyl enough money to fund a bronycon trip aswell as next BUCK
<Chrysalis> unless Saturn, please for the love of celestia, allows to pay in a method other than cash
<Wrek> 05good thing i dont have too many expenses
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Jmo> ._.
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: im going to have to lickyou next year

<Saturn> 08,01Zia: it was the mos fun and most stressful weekend ive ever had
<pony_726> i see nothing :9 (dani)
<pony_6916> is there a stream?
<Zia> I wouldn't mind bronycon if it wasn't full of bronycon attendees
<Dark_Horst> would definately blow my budget
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Damn. :D That is pricey. Im planning on hitting up Equestria LA this November.
<Saturn> 08,01Zia: you should have seen BUCK, our attendees were wonderful
<Wrek> 05if i visit the US ill bring the vikign flu with me
<Wrek> 05muahahaha
<pony_726> :D

<pony_726> :O:)>_>

<Saturn> 08,01Zia: heh, we just ha awesome people; i didnt see any creepiness at buck

<Wrek> 05pony_6916: SuperBrony64 jsut ended his session, and I'd stream myself right now had it not been for a social event i need to attend in the hour
<Zia> Saturn: I can accept that opinion if you also think bronycon *was* full of creepy bronies

<tSparx> MaxTheBrony: He theoritcally has a set number of regenerations
<Vivix> !
<Phase4> 00,02needs work though
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<Saturn> 08,01only 12, i think
<tSparx> MaxTheBrony: Though, y'know, when his 9 (or howevermany) lives run out, they could extend it.
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, i've read many different arguments about that
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Sumica> 00,10the doctor lives for a realy long time and regenorates when he dies
<MaxTheBrony> thats epic
<tSparx> MaxTheBrony: It allows different actors to be hired for shorter periods of time in the same role.
<Phase4> 00,02it seems he has as many regenerations as the writers find convenient
<MaxTheBrony> smart concept
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<tSparx> DAT SUMIPoNY
<Sumica> 00,10well supposadly they get 13 Phase4
<tSparx> and then a RAVEN nevermore
<ekips> gnah, the Thunderbird chat does not support colours it seems >.>

<Rommulus> Ecklsons got some balls telling charles to shut up
<Rommulus> Dcotor Who
<Rommulus> Doctor Who
<tSparx> brony_90: Those do seem to be the options
<tSparx> brony_90: It's an episode of Dr. Who
<tSparx> brony_90: A British, cheap sci-fi series.
<Rommulus> This is the 9th doctor of Doctor who
<Rommulus> and a amazing one at that however the best being the 10th doctor
<tSparx> Rommulus: Yeah but that doesn't mean anything to non-whovians
<Rommulus> True just my opinion.
<MadSurge> ZOMBIEEEES
<tSparx> Rommulus: Oh I agree, I just mean it doesn't help him understand what he's watching
<Sumica> 00,10he's sliping his gears

<DaringDerpy> anarchy!
<brony_90> I¬¥m kinda new to this chat ... can someone say where i can see important commands?
<Sumica> 00,10not many command
<DaringDerpy> brony_90: it's the standard irc commands
<Rommulus> Anyone besides me looking forward to the new season of Dr. Who?
<tSparx> brony_90: Do a google search for IRC commands, but these are the basics:
<Agrold> Rommulus: me:)
<tSparx> brony_90: /nick [name] changes your handle
<Sumica> 00,10you can auto compleat names by typeing a bit then hiting the tab key till it fills the name in
<Vivix> mica
<Rommulus> Agrold, brohoof.
<tSparx> brony_90: /msg [handle] [message] sends a private message to the user named [handle]
<brony_90> tSparx: ok...
<DaringDerpy> she is a spy!
<Sumica> 00,10it's easyer to just open a pm by double clicking the name tSparx
<tSparx> brony_90: /me puts your text into a third-person RP style, and that's about it
<CrimsonPhoenix> oshit I'm missing some Dr.Who
<tSparx> Sumica: Not if you're a purist!
<creeperhugger10> police: "ZOMBIES, GET ON THEE GROUND!! rapeing young wimen is illegal!" zombie: "uuuuurrrrrrgh" police: that... is really sexy in a really occward way!. Zombie: "uuuuuuuuuurgh" Girl: threesome!!! police: YAY!!! zombie: uuuuurgh! aaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!(mating call of zombie.)
<tSparx> Sumica: Or using an old-school client
<Agrold> Rommulus: do you know when tonight it airs?
<Rommulus> I was told it aired tomorrow
<Sumica> 00,10then use /query <usernam> tSparx
<Rommulus> However you can download the episode from the interwebs
<Rommulus> when it is released
<Agrold> yeah
<Vivix> Wops, steam crash
<Agrold> I got to check when it is:P
<CrimsonPhoenix> what have I miss from this episode?
<brony_90> this show seems pretty fucked up :DDD
<Sumica> 00,10depends on where you live Rommulus
<tSparx> Sumica: Oh well hey, that *IS* really useful xD
<Rommulus> I am in Aus so it is airing next week so I am just downloading
<MASF123> MLP: FiM New Season starts September 8th!
<Sumica> 00,10it will be on tv for me in 13 hours
<DaringDerpy> CrimsonPhoenix: one kidnapping, one coach chase and a zombie attack
<MASF123> Get ready bronies!
<creeperhugger10> i rote a short story!!! :)
<tSparx> MASF123: That's not official, is it? I thought we were still under the SSN3-ban
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, source
<MASF123> your mother
<MASF123> Jk.
<Sumica> 00,10besides HubNetvvork said it starts the 22
<MASF123> Hmmm
<CrimsonPhoenix> no source, I won't believe you
<Rommulus> really the 22nd?!
<pyrocatboy> Morning everypony.
<Rommulus> Good morning
<tSparx> src or it didn't happen
<MASF123> Wait...but EQD said 8th
<Sumica> 00,10read the name again Rommulus =p
<tSparx> MASF123: EQD, haha
<MASF123> Could be wrong however
<Vivix> Didn't eqd accidentally put up another rumour?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rommulus, yes 22nd from what HUBNetvvork said
<tSparx> MASF123: It's been going around all day that they got hasty and put up a false rumour xD
<MASF123> Lol
<brony_90> 22nd?! 8th?!! dont play with my mind?! D:
<Agrold> 13 hours until the new who season starts? so almost right after the euro movie night then. I guess 'll download it tomorrow
<Saturn> 08,01so excired about monday
<tSparx> ...I really enjoy this show, but it's so bad, it's so cheap haha
<MASF123> Suppose I better fix all those e-mails :D
<tSparx> BBC low budgets haha
<brony_90> I thought our German shows are bad made xD
<creeperhugger10> zombie/ghost/human 3 on 1 on 3 7person action!
<tSparx> brony_90: O, bist du Deutscher?
<brony_90> :o
<brony_90> bad actor?
<pyrocatboy> Saturn http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ndv7a58O1ru3r25o1_500.png
<Rommulus> The old seasons had bad actors
<creeperhugger10> i can go through!!
<ekips> There are more Germans than one would think here (including myself) tSparx
<brony_90> I¬¥m German :3
<Sumica> 00,10oh I see what you are saying MASF123
<creeperhugger10> goodbye every brony!
<Sumica> 00,10the eqd spoiler ep post
<Rommulus> Goodbye creeperhugger
<Sumica> 00,10clames sep 8 th
<MASF123> Yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> Warning to all ignorant ponies; The release date for seasons 3 still has yet to be announced. Also, when you hear a date from someone, DO NOT BELIEVE THEM RIGHT AWAY. Ask for source, analyse those source.
<Sumica> 00,10I ihghly doubt they would start eps next week with out a single ad showing up on the hub.
<tSparx> ekips: Oh no, I'm aware that there are lots of Germans here :) I love it!
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as it's become the flagship show for them
<Vivix> Never believe until tv program says so
<MASF123> So the episode released could be the 8th, but airs on the 22nd. :/
<Sumica> 00,10they would probably have at least 2-3 weeks of play up for the eps
<MASF123> They could have re-worded that.
<Vivix> They probably would do that yeah Sumica, especially considering how it has improved ratings on other shows they have, so even 2 weeks of ads might give some extra revenue
<alexxm> so many gas ghosts
<DaringDerpy> one week is too short, I agree with that
<Dark_Horst> suddenly evil
<tSparx> Damn, I thought they were good guys
<Rommulus> Suddenly derp
<DaringDerpy> they even changed their color to evil
<Rommulus> So evil
<MASF123> I'm gonna get drunk waiting for this Season to start.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I enjoy this kind of Zombie more
<tSparx> brb
<MadSurge> EEEEEEEEVVIIIIIIILLLLLL
<brony_90> nah... walking dead is best zombie :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> what kind of zombies are in walking dead?
<DaringDerpy> wibbly wobbly
<Kandarihu> Sumica, it was a glitch. The September 8th listing was on Treehouse TV, and the episode title referenced an already-aired episode of some 5-minute buffer show that THTV runs
<DaringDerpy> plague zombies
<tSparx> Shaun of the Dead zombies are best zombies
<CrimsonPhoenix> so virus like and all?
<CrimsonPhoenix> like in RE?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i did't belive it Kandarihu
<DaringDerpy> yes
<Sumica> 00,10like I said I fully expect 3 weeks of play up for it
<brony_90> the new RE games suck
<CrimsonPhoenix> meeeh I saw that too many times
<Kandarihu> I did, until I manned up and read it in full.
<Vivix> The EQD link actually said "it will likely be in end of september" and that 8th was a mistake, but I don't know if their article was a correction of themselves
<MASF123> Wow, the Buffulo! Gonna feel a but upset for extincting them after watching that MLP episode. :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, do you actually believe EQD?
<Vivix> Why not? They said the same thing sumica did
<CrimsonPhoenix> EQD is beyond unprofessional
<Vivix> well in THIS article
<Vivix> they said, 8th is a mistake, I dunno if they posted that image earlier, and that if it was september at all, it would be end due to 'few weeks run up'
<Kandarihu> CrimsonPhoenix, Zap2It was the source of the unprofessionalism. EqD only reported on it.
<MASF123> CrimsonPhoenix they are usually right when it comes to posting upcoming events but they have made past mistakes before.
<Vivix> the post I read said exactly the same as we did here
<Sumica> 00,10the diffrence is Vivix, I dont put a big thing that says oh look new ep, then put a small disclamer saying oh btw this is all just wrong info.
<Vivix> but they might have posted just the zap2it before, I don't know
<Vivix> true
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh gosh...I think I saw the article
<MASF123> EXACTLY? :S
<Vivix> well- almost
<CrimsonPhoenix> can't believe that people are considering photoshops
<MASF123> Lol.
<Vivix> " The Hub tends to announce new seasons of shows a few weeks in advance. If season 3 does start in September, chances are it will be near the end."
<DaringDerpy> her name was robert paulson
<MASF123> I'll laugh if it starts in October. :D
<tSparx> O, sed nos scimus :$
<Rommulus> I hope they bring out a good Nightmare night (halloween) episode would be a great birthday present!
<brony_90> i wnat more luna in the new season
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, I won't be surprised
<Rommulus> I agree more luna
<Vivix> It will be this fall, but due to 13 it might be later
<Vivix> when simpsons started on 13 they started in december, but that was due to a production mixup that made them ship back two episodes as "totally unuseable"
<DaringDerpy> there will be a spin off with shining armor fighting pony crime
<alexxm> what happened to those episodes Vivix
<CrimsonPhoenix> The doctor
*Pearly snuggles Vivix
<tSparx> I wanna see more ponies period
<Pearly> tSparx, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fd4uspchvE
<CrimsonPhoenix> well said
<brony_90> i¬¥m SO hoping for a brony shout out....
<Vivix> well, it was during the beginning, and it- was animated as if it was a road runners cartoon, very rubbery, unscripted jokes, and cartoony, and Matt Groening and most of the directors hated it, it was absolutely terrible compared to their vision. So they shipped them back and begged fox for delay premiere
<CrimsonPhoenix> brony_90, no...just no
<Vivix> the borked episodes were included on s1 dvd
<Sumica> 00,10no video pinks please Pearly
<tSparx> Pearly: Not during streams, unless you ask for it
<alexxm> they drove him mad
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then he went insane
<tSparx> brony_90: Like something subtle, like keeping Derpy around, I'd like that
<Rommulus> Big ben got screwed
<Vivix> keeping her around sure, but less pop references is good
<tSparx> BAD WOLF
<Vivix> their balance now is good
<brony_90> so... what is dr. who about?! ... are they some sort of supernatural detective team n stuff?!
<tSparx> Vivix: They've yet to do anything utterly terrible, I trust them.
<tSparx> brony_90: So, the dude is a Time Lord
<tSparx> brony_90: And he travels through time
<Vivix> tSparx, me too- I was scared to death of the wedding episode, but oh god did I love it
<tSparx> brony_90: With a companion, usually
<tSparx> brony_90: And he solves problems in space-time
<Rommulus> Dr. Who is about a timelord who is called the doctor. A timelord can be reincarnated 13 times before he does and this is the 9th
<Dark_Horst> only 13?
<tSparx> The Doctor
<tSparx> Dr. Who?
<DaringDerpy> where do you have this 13 times thing from?
<Rommulus> he travels around in his tardis which is the big blue box and solves problems in time that should not occour
<tSparx> It's part of the old lore
<tSparx> They made it clear in the old series
<DaringDerpy> they almost used up his charges...they will need a new story about that
<Agrold> he can only be reincarneted 12 times. He does have 13 "lives"
<Rommulus> Thank you Agrold
<Sumica> 00,10they are curently on number 11
<tSparx> Yeah, I bet that when the 13th Doctor dies, they'll still keep it going.
<tSparx> BAD WOLF
<Rommulus> this one we are watching now is 9, David Tennant plays the 10th and Matt Smith plays 11
<Sumica> 00,10you missed by a bit dr
<tSparx> Oh, no wait
<Sumica> 00,10it's not 12 hr, it's a year and 12 hours
<tSparx> Is this the ep where he overshoots
<DaringDerpy> happens
<alexxm> well that was awkward
<Rommulus> just a tad
<tSparx> Damn, I thought this was BADWOLF
<Sumica> 00,10lolwoops
<Rommulus> Technically the whole season is about bad wolf
<tSparx> That ep is creepy as hell, and I love it
<Sumica> 00,10the start of badwolf hinting
<Rommulus> oh Ecklson why couldnt you star for more then just 1 season
<DaringDerpy> he is the worst time driver ever
<tSparx> Rommulus: I honestly don't know much about the story, but...
<Rommulus> he did the emotional side of the dr so well
<Agrold> 12hours... 12 months... what the difference.. really..:)
<Kandarihu> The Doctor's personality DOES change with each regeneration, right?
<Rommulus> Yes
<Agrold> Kandarihu: yes
<Rommulus> As does his age
<Rommulus> appearance
<MadSurge> WHO SOILED THE TARDIS
<Rommulus> likes and dislikes
<Rommulus> all
<tSparx> dat spamkick
<DaringDerpy> just travel back 12 months...
<tSparx> Dr. = M.D. only, clearly
<DaringDerpy> lol
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: Right?
<Pearly> what in the link for this?
<Kandarihu> If mom catches me watching Dr Who, she might not take kindly to me playing PSO2 at anything more than 640x480 at mute
<Kandarihu> Might as well restart now
<tSparx> Why can't they just go backward?
<DaringDerpy> he has no idea how the tardis works
<DaringDerpy> he stole it
<Sumica> 00,10cause space ships need air horns
<tSparx> DaringDerpy: What!? He's a TIME LORD, right? How can you be a Time Lord who doesn't know how to travel through time?
<Rommulus> Dem airhorns
<MadSurge> Suddendly SPACE CHIPS
<brony_90> lol at dat sound xD
<DaringDerpy> in one episode, the criminal woman told him that the tardis sound is actually the handbrake...normally it shouldn't do such noises
<CrimsonPhoenix> The doctor always land on a conveniant time
<Agrold> spaceairhorns are best horns
<Sumica> 00,10tSparx, the tardis takes 7 to drive it properly
<Rommulus> he knows how to use the tardis however it is ment to be operated by 6 timelords not 1 so there are complications
<MadSurge> Welp bye Big Ben
<Rommulus> in most points the tardis drags the doctor to points in time where things need to be fixed
<Kandarihu> Really? And he doesn't like the idea of bringing an entire family onboard the TARDIS?
<alexxm> doctors happy again
<tSparx> Sumica: So you're saying that he should have 6 other members of his species, and he's trying to pilot it himself?
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: NOPE
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<tSparx> Kk
<Sumica> 00,10that is why he has a hard time landing where he should
<Rommulus> He stole the tardis from a museam as the current tardis is a older model
<Kandarihu> If a crew of 7 is proper for the TARDIS, then bringing an entire family onboard would be the most appropiate thing for it.
<tSparx> Kandarihu: Seven Time Lords
<tSparx> Kandarihu: There aren't six other Time Lords, period, anymore.
<Rommulus> Well he would need to teach them and that just wouldnt be fun XD
<Rommulus> so we are watching a tv show tv show
<alexxm> tvception
<Kandarihu> tSparx, so a human can't be part of the crew, just a passenger?
<Sumica> 00,10more or less.
<tSparx> Kandarihu: It seems that way. Time Lords are kinda magical, humans probably couldn't figure it out as well as a Time Lord.
<Sumica> 00,10they can help but realy it takes a time lord to drive it
<Rommulus> They can its just its complicated
<DaringDerpy> I would try to steal a piece of it and offer it on ebay. Infinite money. :)
<CCCP> Hi
<DaringDerpy> a columbia depris piece rose to $16mio in a few minutes
<tSparx> Hey DeadpoolDash and CCCP !
<alexxm> how you doing CCCP
<Rommulus> as a tardis is a very complicated piece of machinery that is both living and machine and the pilots would need a understanding of time and space so they could pinpoint their destinations
<DeadpoolDash> hello
<Agrold> hello CCCP
<DaringDerpy> then they deleted the auction -.-
<Rommulus> Hi CCCP

<Rommulus> For the people who have watched more, what is your favourite companion?
<Sergio_Scriptor> So is prince-dari streaming ? :)
<Jmo> nop Sergio_Scriptor
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rommulus: Rose,Amy and Rory :)
<Jmo> Can't you see the OC ;~;
<AdamTheDuck> Sumi is streaming I'm assuming
<cowvarkian> Sergio_Scriptor: sumica
<Sergio_Scriptor> oh yeah :D sorry Sumica :)
<Rommulus> For me it is Amy and Rory
<CrimsonPhoenix> so wait...all those ETs are linked?
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS IS GOING ON FACEBOOOK\
<MadSurge> They look like sillier Gorons
<Rommulus> aawww yeeeaaa
<cow334> what are we watching.... that thing looks like a baby with a big body
<cowvarkian> that was campy
<Sergio_Scriptor> I did not notest you OC sumi,sorry :$
<Rommulus> We are watching Doctor who
<Rommulus> with the 9th doctor
<MadSurge> ^
<tSparx> sumipony
<cowvarkian> <.<
<cowvarkian> and then nobody believes him
<Rommulus> You dont say mr military man
<Sergio_Scriptor> so what are you guys favoritre doctor ? :)
<tSparx> tennant
<Rommulus> 10th Tennant
<cowvarkian> I really lik the tennant run
<cowvarkian> *like
<Agrold> is it wrong to think the alien faces looks like the newborn cuties ponies http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/3441/48362940.gif ...
<Sergio_Scriptor> mine is tennant and smith :P
<Jmo> Tom Baker and David Tennant.
<tSparx> See, this is just cheesy xD
<cowvarkian> not wrong, Agrold
<Sergio_Scriptor> i dont care what they say,i think smith is doing a decent job as the doctor :P
<Rommulus> Of course not Agrold, they are both terrifying and monstrous
<Kandarihu> Agrold, absolutely not
<cow334> looks like a baby
<Agrold> haha:P
<cowvarkian> same, Sergio_Scriptor
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: I don't think *he's* bad, I hate the writing of the latest Who
<Rommulus> Smith is definatly doing a good job as the doctor, he plays it well it was just unfortunate for him to come after tennant
<Sergio_Scriptor> Rommulus: exactly,i bet if he came before tennat it was david that would be getting all the hate :|
<prince-dari> Lawl no.
<prince-dari> Smith is a bad actor.
<cow334> ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy here we go
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi dari
<prince-dari> And he made the Doctor his own
<Rommulus> not sure about tennant getting the hate because he is still a really good doctor
<tSparx> don't fall for the bait
<cow334> what are we watching?
<prince-dari> Just he made his Doctor shite.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Also the new doctor who writing is good...i mean The Silence :) how could you not like them ? :)
<prince-dari> Hey Sumi.
<tSparx> cow334: Dr. Who
<Jmo> Quit your hating prince-dari, honestly.
<Jmo> So picky.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that....is totally not creepy
<cow334> tSparx: oh thanks for telling me
<Agrold> I think both Tennant and Smith have both good and ad momments. I eally like alot of the earlier Tennant episodes, but in the end, especialy the last few minuttes, he got a bit too emo for my taste
<Rommulus> I believe is you put matt in spot of the 9th doctor then everyone would of loved him
<Sergio_Scriptor> prince-dari: it might be another actor,but it's still the same doctor we all care and love :)
<prince-dari> jaymoo pls
<CrimsonPhoenix> NOT CREEPY
<Jmo> dabi
<Jmo> pls
<cowvarkian> isnt that the point dari
<cowvarkian> to make it your own
<prince-dari> It's not Sergio_Scriptor
<cow334> ...dafuq?
<prince-dari> Each actor makes the Doctor their own.
<prince-dari> Different
<prince-dari> And Matt Smith's Doctor sucks dick
<Rommulus> how did 2 of them hide behind a door!
<Rommulus> Matt Smith is good and so was tennant
<Sergio_Scriptor> prince-dari: what exactly is the reason to why you dont like smith ? :\
<tSparx> prince-dari: Well, ain't nothing wrong with sucking a dick :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> nice to meet you
<cow334> so she couldnt just have done that in the first place....]
<CrimsonPhoenix> likewise
<prince-dari> Explained so many times already
<prince-dari> I'll just PM you what I said last time
<alexxm> so the aliens weakness is fire extinqushers
<Sumica> 00,10every one likes her
<Sergio_Scriptor> prince-dari: no i know,i kind of know you by now :\
<Rommulus> she is awesome
<Kandarihu> alexxm, whatever screws up their body chemistry
<Agrold> matt Smith makes the doctor seem a bit more alien, and imho, I think that's a good thing. But again it's MY opinion:)
<Sergio_Scriptor> prince-dari: and what is your opinon on Amy and Rory ? :P
<prince-dari> Amy's a bitch, Rory's pretty cool.
<Sergio_Scriptor> indeed :d
<Rommulus> I enjoy amy and rory together not alone however
<DaringDerpy> interesting detail
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god my sides
<Sumica> 00,10I love the doctor's pulling a supprise out of his ass.
<Buytoast> is this speilberg's twilight zone?
<cow334> wait is that sopossed to be the doctor?
<tSparx> Guten Tag, Herr Buytoast. Wie geht es ihr?
<cow334> I swear he look diffrent in the trailers
<tSparx> Buytoast: Dr. Who
<tSparx> cow334: Different actors play the doc
<Jim> Ohai everypony!
<Kandarihu> That was some wonderful bluffing with the Sonic Screwdriver
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Jim
<alexxm> how you doing Jim
<Rommulus> I agree
<cow334> tSparx: What happend to the old one
<tSparx> cow334: There have been 11
<Jim> alexxm, Good, except that I'm exhausted from job
<Rommulus> we are watching the 9th at the moment
<alexxm> whats your job Jim
<cow334> tSparx: 11 seasons? or episodes
<tSparx> cow334: It's a series convention, the Dr. dies and is rengerated (as a new actor), this is #9 Chris Eccleston
<Sumica> 00,1011 actors
<tSparx> cow334: 11 actors that play the Doc
<Rommulus> theres 11 doctors so far however most doctors have done more then 1 season
<tSparx> cow334: More than 11 seasons, I think anyway
<Sumica> 00,10one actor was a movie only
<Jim> alexxm, I direct/stop cars during road construction
<Rommulus> each doctor is a different actor
<cow334> tSparx: ho-holy shit
<Buytoast> so dr who is black?
<Rommulus> really Sumica? I didnt know that
<cow334> thats is pretty cool never seen a serios like that before
<Sumica> 00,1010th and 11th got two seasions so far
<tSparx> cow334: It's a HUGE deal in Britain, and American Anglophiles dig it too :P
<Jim> Rowan Atkinson is best Doctor
<tSparx> Buytoast: No no
<Sumica> 00,108th doctor iirc was a movie
<Agrold> 8th doctor is best doctor:3
<Sergio_Scriptor> also matt smith said he is going to be the doctor until at least 2014 :P
<tSparx> Buytoast: The Dr. is the dude with the short brown hair who locked himself in the room
<Rommulus> David Tennant is best doctor
<cow334> tSparx: that sounds pretty awesome so they die at the end of every season
<Jim> Rommulus, Agreed
<tSparx> cow334: Not every season, some get more, some got less.
<Sumica> 00,10this one only lasted one season
<Jim> There will be a new season today! Can't wait for the new adventures of the Doctor!
<tSparx> cow334: It's really a plot device to allow the BBC to hire and fire actors on a regular basis :P
<Buytoast> oh, so that skinhead is the doctor?
<Sergio_Scriptor> tSparx: it keep the show interesting :)
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Rommulus> That was one of the points that made it for me for ecklson
<tSparx> Buytoast: The guy with the screwdriver
<Buytoast> he looks like the guy from american history x after prison
<tSparx> Hanging with the blonde
<Rommulus> when he says sorry to the secretary
<Agrold> Anyway, you're the one streaming right, Sumica? How many episodes are we gonna watch today?
<cow334> tSparx: aaah okay then I got to watch a episode pretty soon this looks amazing and the way they do it as well
<Sergio_Scriptor> im i the only that thinks that the 9th is a little...Dull ?
<Rommulus> Yea he was at times however when he got into the more darker emotional points he was very good
<tSparx> cow334: I think it's okay, I like it but it's far from my favorite TV show. It's done cheaply, on purpose, but the story behind the terrible special effects is really, really good.
<Sergio_Scriptor> yeah :) true
<tSparx> cow334: Or at least fun :P
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: I love the end of this doc's tenure
<Rommulus> Tennant kept the audience entranced with his personality creating not a single dull moment.
<cow334> tSparx: woot woot I got to give it a try ...dont really know what is going o right now so to me its all good right now
<tSparx> What a shame that would've been...
<Kandarihu> Not so stupid
<Sergio_Scriptor> also what actor do you guys want for 12th doctor ? :P
<CCCP> Oh well now mamma we all go to hell.
<prince-dari> Rowan Atkinson again
<Squallken> movie?
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: Michael Gambon
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: Not really, yet that would be cool
<alexxm> Sergio_Scriptor john de lancie
<DaringDerpy> passwords...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rowan was a doctor?
<cow334> alexxm: that would be cool]\
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: I think it'd be neat to see Stephen Fry. Or, a female Dr.
<Sergio_Scriptor> prince-dari: i wna thim too :d either him or patrcik stewart :P
<Kandarihu> Charles Craig for the lulz
<prince-dari> For a sport relif episode, CrimsonPhoenix
<Agrold> rowan did a parody on the doctor
<tSparx> Ooh Pat Stewart'd be good!
<prince-dari> He was so good
<Agrold> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> sport relif?
<Rommulus> He is not a actor but Stephen Malkmus
<prince-dari> relief*
<Kandarihu> I probably got that name wrong. The guy who played David Lister in Red Dwarf
<CrimsonPhoenix> again sport relief?
<Buytoast> it means he stood in when the guy got hurt playing hand-egg
<Sergio_Scriptor> can you guys imagine if Hugh Laurie played the doctor ? :d
<tSparx> BADWOLF?
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: Comic relief
<Sergio_Scriptor> "I need my vicodin " :D
<Buytoast> wait, they play slippy dippy grassy kicky over in europe
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: That'd be AWESOME
<CrimsonPhoenix> I see
<cow334> chuck noriss be the doctor.
<tSparx> Sergio_Scriptor: But ONLY if he keeps his American accent :$
<Sergio_Scriptor> tSparx: it would be hilarious :D
<alexxm> Sergio_Scriptor how about jason statham
<Rommulus> Chuck Norris would be hilarious but wouldnt fit
<cow334> Wait could there be any chance the doctor being a girl?
<Sergio_Scriptor> alexxm: yeah good enough too :P
<prince-dari> Yeah cow334
<tSparx> I think.... I think he might be facetiously suggesting that it does not, in fact, narrow it down.
<Jim> So, you can kill them with toothpaste?
<cow334> prince-dari: Really that would be awesome having a change for a season
<Sergio_Scriptor> we never had a black doctor :P
*Jim brushie brushie
<tSparx> cow334: It's never happened before, but the doctor's incarnation doesn't even need to be human-looking
<prince-dari> We ALMOST had a black Doctor instead of Matt Smith.
<Jim> Sergio_Scriptor, If he only was a ginger
<prince-dari> A good actor...
<prince-dari> ;_;
<Sergio_Scriptor> Jim: :D yep
<Buytoast> will smith?
<tSparx> Dr. Who -- Chris Rock
<Buytoast> denzel washington?
<tSparx> hahaha
<Phase4> prince-dari, matt smith isnt that bad
<Phase4> inb4 ban
<tSparx> Will Smit as the Doctor would ROCK
<prince-dari> B&
<alexxm> boom
<Jim> Vinegarred to death
<CrimsonPhoenix> Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeew
<AdamTheDuck> Whoa o.o
<MASF123> Will Smith atw
<cow334> tSparx: aw well i guess then but it sill would have been awesome
<Rommulus> eewwwwww aline spoooog
<tSparx> Why is Phase4 not mod-coloured?
<DaringDerpy> nice
<Sylandest> I don't think we'd want Will Smith as the Doctor
<Rommulus> alien*
<Phase4> tSparx, i left my colours in linux
<Jim> He's dead, Jim.
<tSparx> Phase4, ah, kk, I was worried you'd been fired or something :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: :d you are one of us now >: I
<Phase4> Sergio_Scriptor, :P
<Jmo> prince-dari, Smith is best doctor.
<Jmo> dabimad?
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4 has been reduced to a mere commoner :P
<Rommulus> dun dun duuuun

<cow334> Sergio_Scriptor: so he gaurds it then baisclly
<CrimsonPhoenix> Buytoast, he doesn't have the tardis
<Rommulus> he watches over time and space to make sure that nothing goes amiss that isnt ment to happen in time and to do this he uses his time machine called the tardis
<Sergio_Scriptor> cow334: exactly :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> he's stuck in that room

<Sergio_Scriptor> Belly Bros
<Kandarihu> Well, I see the Pillow Pets were successful.
<Sumica> 00,10hehe, hub thought carebears would be as big a hit as ponies
<JESmith> At least when the Season 3 ads start playing here (Espically if it's during the Saturday repeats) we'll know it before EqD
<Rommulus> Silly hub
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sumica: silly hub :3
<Tovler> I like watching Carebears highlights on The Soup
<cow334> dat scream
<Cypresswolf> Lightning doesnt strike twice in the same place
<Ravebrony> Sumica: Well its mainly about Celestia being high power :D I know if i was a 'student/assistant' of the president id be scared out of my Wits if i didnt do something he asked :D
<CCCP> poor rarity
<The_Greener> Huh. Rather Smile song trot there.
<CrimsonPhoenix> THE
<CCCP> :'(
<CrimsonPhoenix> WORST POSSIBLE
<CrimsonPhoenix> THING
<Ravebrony> Rarity time!
<Ravebrony> Inb4 Cute!!
<Rommulus> this is the worst possible thing!
<Ravebrony> *Flip
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity does best pout
<JESmith> Wonder if they'll play them during the Wedding rerun. Who knows

<Rommulus> silly rarity
<Ravebrony> Hehe
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, gemstones, not ribbons
<Pearly> "you think I would really lay on the ground?"
<JESmith> Maybe it doesn't work if it's in ribbon form?
<Pearly> that chair is epic
<Sumica> 00,10diamoend encrusted ribon CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> too small?
<DerpyMuffins> Twilight pulled a batman
<Rommulus> dat sun
<Ravebrony> Sumica: But she has to have lots of gems in there :D and she cant find specific ones :P
<Kandarihu> Her house is filled with gemstones. Her revealing gemstones spells will light up her whole house
<Sumica> 00,10would narrow down the search Ravebrony
<Ravebrony> Shes used to finding piles of gems
<Buytoast> so are you people ready to join modern gamers with the glorious and superior EA Origin?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Buytoast, I'll stick with Steam thank you
<Ravebrony> Sumica: But its Rarity, drama must be included! :)
<Rommulus> Dont make me laugh
<Sergio_Scriptor> Buytoast: ehr...no ? :\

<CCCP> >_>
<Sergio_Scriptor> Gollum scene :)
<pony_4042> Just here. The Video would not load, and the error was in the chat.
<JESmith> Sumica: Happens to me every now and then but usually a refresh clears that for me
<pony_4042> It said to download a chat program or something
<Kandarihu> I updated my Firefox, but not my Flash
<Sumica> 00,10then it sounds like you had an advertisment
<alexxm> ok that was pretty creepy
<Sergio_Scriptor> Twilight has pressed childhood memories :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> *repressed
<Sumica> 00,10adblock+ would prevent that
<Rommulus> poor twilight =(
<Kandarihu> Now that I've seen LotR, I see the Gollum reference there
<pony_4042> I do have adblock.
<Ravebrony> Oh Pinkie :D
<Sumica> 00,10because any flash error would not be limited to just this site
<cow334> like a pinke
<DerpyMuffins> Luna has Dissociative Identity Disorder
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS THE
<Ravebrony> The Worst Possible Thing!
<CrimsonPhoenix> WORST
<Rommulus> Balloons! because gravity works that way
<alexxm> the hell did pinkie do that for
<CrimsonPhoenix> POSSIBLE THING

<Sumica> 00,10there you go twi, you just learned somthing about friends
<cow334> TO THE MOOON
<Sumica> 00,10they can be jerks just like any one else
<Sergio_Scriptor> Tarde
<Master> S1E3
<DerpyMuffins> Twilight has OCD, Luna has DID so does Fluttershy, Celestia has Mommy issues, and Pinkie is crazy
<Master> of MLP
<DaringDerpy> ticket master?
<Master> yea
<Ravebrony> UHHH
<CrimsonPhoenix> AAAAAAARGH
<Kandarihu> Right after Rarity mentions not wanting to lay on the grass, Rainbow Dash lays down on the tablecloth
<JESmith> Although it happens all the time when I try to use it on the Guest account on my mom's computer at home when I visit. Which is just weird because I do it under her account instead of the Guest it works
<Ravebrony> Oh Rarity, lmao
<Sergio_Scriptor> dat grunt noise :d
<cow334> Sumica: Thats true not every one is nice friends or foal
<Master> remember when Rarity sings about what she would do wit the ticket?
<Sumica> 00,10Pinkie is not crazy, she just trolls
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love you Rarity <3
<DaringDerpy> yes
<LoGaN> oh no!
<Master> ok
<Pearly> Pinkie Pie has her own disorswe
<Pearly> disorder*
<Master> Rarity sings about Princess Celestias NEPHEW Prince Blueblood
*CCCP snuggles LoGaN
<LoGaN> CCCP: are you gay?
<Sumica> 00,10do have to say they suddenly advertiseing the ep like this is odd
<Sergio_Scriptor> dem bitches
<pony_4042> Is the rumor of Rainbow Dash getting a boyfriend in season 3 true? I heard it was on Lauren Faust's DA account.
<Cypresswolf> Rerun will never be as awesome as original airing :) Never!
<Master> but hes not an Alicorn, and we only see him one more time
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah we won't see any ads for season 3 this week
<JESmith> Sumica: Yeah forget Twilight, they're ain't no pony trollin' down like Pinkie
<Sumica> 00,10I wonder if they want us all to watch for some reason
<Sergio_Scriptor> pony_4042: nah it's fake :P
<Tovler> brushie brushie brushie
<cow334> hopefully in the middle of the month or the first beginning of it
<Kandarihu> Well, it's a good episode anyway
<JESmith> Again, maybe first Season 3 ads will play during it?
<pony_4042> Oh. Thought she was hooking up with that male Wonderbolt.
<Sumica> 00,10pony_4042, when in doubt go to the sorce and see for your self.
<Sergio_Scriptor> pony_4042: that would be cool :)
<Cypresswolf> A Brush is a brush - Arent they all the same?
<MasterBrony> does anyone understand my question?
<Tovler> "normal hair" *winces*
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. An ad for Season 3 will probably contain spoilers for at least the season premier.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Cypresswolf: not for the wrong type of grils :|
<Sergio_Scriptor> *girls
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's always double
<DaringDerpy> there were lots of discussions about this on ponychan, Master. I think they agreed that he is adopted or something
<Sumica> 00,10yep Kandarihu
<Tovler> just call it wrong hair
<MasterBrony> what happens to Prince Blueblood, and how is he related to Celestia, if he's not an Alicorn
<Sumica> 00,10hub was doing that in s2
<LoGaN> oh yeah!
<Sumica> 00,10spoiling the next weeks eps
<pony_4042> I heard Blueblood was supposed to be a Duke, but they made him a Prince instead.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'LL MAKE A FRIENDSHIP PROBLEM
<Phase4> s3 y u no here now
<Ravebrony> I hated those ads :D
<Rommulus> silly twilight the tock isnt ticking thats the sun
<Rommulus> silly twilight
<Ravebrony> Hi guuurls
<CrimsonPhoenix> HEY GIIIIRLS~
<Rommulus> clock*
<JESmith> Here comes the insane Twilight
<Sergio_Scriptor> :D
<cow334> O-o
<MasterBrony> dat ear twitch
*CCCP nomz CrimsonPhoenix
<DaringDerpy> fun fact: this was exactly the same nest as in winter wrap up
<Flyboy> hurro everypony
<Rommulus> dat eye twitch
<The_Greener> MasterBrony, many generations removed, as Faust mentioned.
<LoGaN> hu gggguurllss
<Cypresswolf> GRRRReat! ^_^
<DaringDerpy> the one that twilight made
<alexxm> sup Flyboy
<CCCP> LoGaN no i said no already
<TheRandomkid321> I am here to apolagise for my diorderly behaviour earlier. I am currently going through a really hard time in my life. My grandfather probably won't live to see october.
<alexxm> well twilights finally snapped
<Sumica> 00,10I realy like her voice crack
<Sergio_Scriptor> this Twilight is so cute :3
<cow334> that squeak
<Sergio_Scriptor> oh sorry to know that TheRandomkid321 :(
<Kandarihu> pony_4042, this whole limitation with royal titles has really screwed them up. Everypony in the royal family is a prince or a princess, and only one of them is the reining monarch.
<CCCP> LoGaN but i guess that means no huggies :(
<Rommulus> its alright Random, we understand.
<Pearly> apple bloom and apple jack are cool
<MasterBrony> ok, ill try and iscuss this question laterz, when everypony is not too distracted
<LoGaN> CCCP: hugs<3
<CCCP> TheRandomkid321 :( im sorry
<Pearly> I still like pinkie pie
<DaringDerpy> there is no crown prince. celestia doesn't like the thought to share power
<DerpyMuffins> Where did Twilight learn the Want it, Need it spell?
<spitfirecolt2> thats my sis twilight
<pony_4042> I wonder if Twilight learned that spell from Cadence.
<Sumica> 00,10that is understandable TheRandomkid321, but please do try to direct your rage.
<cow334> squeak
<Cypresswolf> You're going to LOVE SMARTY PANTS!
<Kandarihu> Technically, though, Celestia IS sharing the power with Luna, though.
<cow334> lol
<Rommulus> Whenever emotions run high especially due to family problems it can be really hard to deal with it, you are forgiven Random. ^.^
<DaringDerpy> books, DerpyMuffins
<Sumica> 00,10lashing out randomly is a quickway to make every one dislike you
<Rommulus> e'yup
<Ravebrony> Good thing i missed it then :o
<alexxm> well that was easy
<Sergio_Scriptor> nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> THAT INCREDIBLE AMAZING DOLL
<cow334> bon bon
<Sergio_Scriptor> STICK TO ONE VOICE :|
<Cypresswolf> Big Mac gets all the mares
<Rommulus> she is a voice actor
<cow334> O-O
<Eli> and i came here in time for ponies! :)
<Rommulus> she do what she want, cause shes a strong independant pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sergio_Scriptor, I like bonbon's voice range
<otakon> YOU BROKE THE RULES!
<Sergio_Scriptor> CrimsonPhoenix: i like it too :P
<Rommulus> lol rainbow with the glasses on
<TheRandomkid321> I really should be the one apolagising. And I agree Sumica. I just had a really hard time recently. At school I am contantly tormented by a bunch of idiots one has the guts to call himself a brony despite being one of the most mentally insane people I know.
<cow334> mayor mare can really run fast...for as old as she is
<TheRandomkid321> He cuts people for pleasure. FOR PLEASURE!
<Sumica> 00,10like I said TheRandomkid321, I understand ^_^
<otakon> whoa nelly
<spitfirecolt2> did twilights family know smarty pants
<cow334> O-O MI GOD
<Buytoast> someone has a different mindset than me
<Buytoast> I', GONNA BE MAD
<MasterBrony> but i LIKE cutting people
<Rommulus> ermahgerd
<otakon> cow334: oh their god
<Kandarihu> TheRandomkid321, I know the feeling
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scrunchy Derpy
<Rommulus> you so screwed twilight
<MasterBrony> dat Derpy
<otakon> dat Mayor Mare blush
<alexxm> derpy

<Buytoast> WRONG
<JESmith> Hey Sumi are you going to be streaming the reruns every week until the premiere?

<NullRadix> Facebook is dying. At a slightly faster pace than WoW
<Sergio_Scriptor> this toys are nothing but plastic grabage...what happen to the oold hand-made wooden toys ? :'(
<NullRadix> it'll probably still be around for another 10 years
<DaringDerpy> I like the pillow pets

<Tovler> :( Rob Renzetti
<Eli> Sumica: i'm gonna come over to live there in 2 years, so i'm gonna find out :)

<DaringDerpy> NullRadix: but not the user base
<Pearly> haha rarity has always somehting royal to lay on
<Cypresswolf> They actually got the guy who narrates that Rich & Fabuluos series?

<Rommulus> How many hours until the wedding episode
<DerpyMuffins> They just let a kid walk around like that?
<Tovler> you mook
<CrimsonPhoenix> Filly AJ is cute
<Rommulus> agreed
<Kandarihu> Facebook will probably reinvent itself to stay alive. The taxpayer gravy train is about to be derailed.
<DaringDerpy> how old are they? 150 years?
<Pearly> Rommulus, next weekend
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aj is now Rarity
<Rommulus> Thank you Pearly

<Ravebrony> She left home
<Pearly> 6am pst 9est

<CrimsonPhoenix> I deserved that
<JESmith> pony_4042: Sometimes the mods here set up TF2 servers and stream matches on here. If you're here during that time you can get in on it
<Eli> i should watch that part in german... she doesn't have an accent to begin with in german
<Pearly> hey thelonepony
<Kandarihu> Less physical activity probably means the metabolism will be lower.
<Sumica> 00,10intersting they are pushing back the pony eps 3 hours

<Ravebrony> Woah, Sumica, where do you live? Are you the one in Vegas?
<JESmith> I keep forgetting the time zone differences between us
<Kandarihu> Flight Camp
<Cypresswolf> I still think AJ's parents are roaming for seeds like Granny Smith did in her youth
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Ravebrony
<Ravebrony> Ah

<Ravebrony> And nopony goes to save her....
<Sergio_Scriptor> LoGaN: Lauren Faust sais she wanted a episode where applejack needs to deal with her parents death,but it was canceled due to being to dark for a season 1 :|
<Rommulus> cause im frrreeeeeee, freeee falling
<Sumica> 00,10I might add that is also the time they showed ponies for most of s2 as well
<Ravebrony> Sergio_Scriptor: Omg D:

<DaringDerpy> death is a no no in this show
<JESmith> 10 AM is 1 PM for me. Good I hope they keep that time again for the new S3 eps
<Rommulus> death, nope to the moon!
<cow334> ...O-O
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i kind liked that time as well, it ment I could sleep in
<Cypresswolf> Think about it, all the Apple family have their own orchards all over Equestria - perhaps they're looking for more places to expand their apple empire - A ponified Johnny Appleseed
<LoGaN> no
<Kandarihu> Augmented Reality! The future of Dennou Coil is still possible!
<Eli> Sumica: as mentioned earlier: weird toys!

<Flyboy> you americans are weird...
<Rommulus> 12:42 am
<Tovler> It'll be fun for approximately 3.7 seconds
<Cypresswolf> I'll stick with my headlight slippers from sky mall, thank you :)
<cow334> ponys dont come on till 12AM here...
<DaringDerpy> marketin departments make weird products
<Eli> Sumica: i meant the stumpees
<DaringDerpy> +g

<DerpyMuffins> Never really liked Fluttershy......
<thelonepony> D:
*Agrold loves this song
<Rommulus> dat fluttershy
<Pearly> hehe
<Pearly> me too
*Eli agrees with Agrold
<Rommulus> ditto
<DerpyMuffins> Fluttershy sounds kinda annoying to me
<Ravebrony> Regardless tho, you cant Hate Fluttershy :D
<JESmith> What's this? What's this? There's birdies in the air. What's this? What's this? There's bunnies everywhere
<Pearly> Agrold, I have the unofficial soundtrackand I am addicted to that song
<Rommulus> too cute
<Sumica> 00,10wait, if the sonicboom disapatited all the clouds
<Agrold> :P
<Tovler> There's children throwing snowballs instead throwing heads!
<Sumica> 00,10then dash just killed all the spectators
<Kandarihu> I have to be WATCHING in order to not hear that and think that she's being a Pegasus Supremacist.
<Ravebrony> LOL
<cow334> ducks cant fly...
<Rommulus> oh look new clouds
<Rommulus> they formed quickly
<Ravebrony> wut?
<cow334> O-O or can they
<Kandarihu> Er, wait. Let me fix that:
<LunarSS> Ducks can fly :p
<Eli> and that's how you get a tatoo on your ass
<Ravebrony> Rarity time! Awww yeeeah!
<Kandarihu> I have to be WATCHING in order to hear that and NOT think that she's being a Pegasus Supremacist.
<pony_4042> Can't unhear Yaplap's version of that song.
<Derpy_Hooves> morning
<Sumica> 00,10I meen just think of that poor earth filly that was on the clouds
<Rommulus> awww yea!
<CrimsonPhoenix> time for Rarity's Quest
<Sumica> 00,10lol that digital skip
<Rommulus> Time for THE ROCK!
<cow334> patiens is a virtual
<Tovler> o dat cheerilee
<Pearly> time for tom
<Cypresswolf> Green is not your color Scootaloo
<NullRadix> that slight stream freeze... and the facial expression I think I saw...
<CCCP> shes sooo cute
<Pearly> :D
<Ravebrony> I...wonder what the performance was about... O_o
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity's Quest
<CCCP> lol
<Sumica> 00,10Loved that look on her face
<DocSane> Morning, all you crazy kids.
<CrimsonPhoenix> OMG A GIANT ROCK
<Bogs> .
<cow334> and how she gets backs
<Kandarihu> The Sonic Rainboom has never been known to dissapate clouds. They probably have the potential, though. But even if it did, Rainbow Dash is at a safe distance.
<CCCP> hello DocSane!!!
<Rommulus> That would be so fun
<Barbetos|AtWork> Rarity and rocks.
<Ravebrony> Dumb Rock!!!
<MASF123> Follow your nose!
<Barbetos|AtWork> I will never understand.
<cow334> its a mistory
<alexxm> dumb rocl
<Barbetos|AtWork> She will probably marry a guy named rock.
<DocSane> I want a flashback episode to when all the characters were kids.
<Rommulus> hey dont steal pinkies rock! thats her east field!
<Sumica> 00,10they showed it disapating clouds Kandarihu
<CrimsonPhoenix> how old IS Colgate
<Eli> speaking of Fluttershy: the german version is not so bad overall. AJ has no accent, most of the voices are weird, and some of the names just sound plain ugly in german. but that's all fine, the worst part is: Fluttershy doesn't squee!
<Cypresswolf> Sparkly Dancing Food
<pony_4042> Full Grown Derpy in crowd.
<CCCP> I love this episode!
<Sumica> 00,10the shockwave wiped them out
<Ravebrony> Oh Scootaloo... :D
<DocSane> Eli: Wait, they didn't even give AJ a Bavarian accent?
<Kandarihu> Where did it happen? I don't remember.
<Barbetos|AtWork> stfu Rarity. CMC is on the case!
<Eli> DocSane: enope
<DocSane> Oh, Twi, you always sound so sincere.
<CrimsonPhoenix> COLGATE IS EVERYWHERE
<Ravebrony> Oh, that reminds me. Sumica, is the winner for the Art Contest up? :o
<Cypresswolf> Derpy!
<Rommulus> Dat Colgate infestation!
<Ravebrony> I wanna see some art!
<Sumica> 00,10contest?
<pony_4042> So if Derpy is full grown when the Mane 6 were fillys, is Derpy a Grandma?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lyra is there, but not unicorn.
<Derpy_Hooves> hello?
<Barbetos|AtWork> wut/
<DocSane> Eli: I'd have thought that would have been the obvious thing to do.
<Sumica> 00,10think you are asking the wrong person
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hi Derpy_Hooves
<Sumica> 00,10i do streams not art
<Rommulus> over 9000 colgates
<Cypresswolf> Derpy is a timelord?
<CCCP> I love their Voices when their kids :)
<Derpy_Hooves> Morning! o/
<DocSane> pony_4042: Nope. She's a time traveler.
<Eli> DocSane: well, me too, but what can you do?
<Barbetos|AtWork> MLP is art?
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat G1 Twilight
<Rommulus> oh damn
<Barbetos|AtWork> nope
<Cypresswolf> Is that Wildfire?
<Kandarihu> I mean, she only did it 4 times. Once to rescue Rarity, once in this flashback at groundlevel, once to destroy AJ's barn, and the latest time to celebrate the wedding.
<Tovler> Unicorn Sibsy is judging you
<cow334> noo
<Pearly> awwww a lil spike
<DocSane> Eli: I don't actually know German, but friends of mine years ago explained the whole "Bavarian = redneck accent" to me.
<Rommulus> cliff hanger
<Ravebrony> Sumica: Oh alright, it was a post on the home page :o
<DocSane> Rarity's dad!
<pony_4042> I may be wrong, but Twilight's dad is based on a Gen 1 german only pony toy, right?
<CrimsonPhoenix> pony_4042, possibly
<Sumica> 00,10wonder how long before they stop being sticky
<Cypresswolf> :) Because real darts are dangerous
<Barbetos|AtWork> You know if I had a kid that liked those things I would just show him how to play darts.
<Sumica> 00,10zomg press dough is back!
<JESmith> Them Lego ponies
<Barbetos|AtWork> eat it
<MASF123> Was Dat Pinkie?
<Barbetos|AtWork> ?
<Barbetos|AtWork> where?
<JESmith> There was a Rainbow one too
<Rommulus> I saw a rainbow
<Cypresswolf> I'd love to see a playdoh commercial right after this
<Tovler> :( I'm a grown up now? When did that happen?
<MASF123> Mmmm....Playdoh.
<Barbetos|AtWork> yesterday Tovler
<Cypresswolf> Which one was edible again?
*MASF123 foams out mouth
<alexxm> Tovler it tends to happen
<JESmith> Barbetos|AtWork: That Hub ad before this that showed lego Pinkie and Rainbow
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, you know what else is back?
<Agrold> Cypresswolf: playdoh.. I hope
<MASF123> Oh no!
<Sumica> 00,10gyrobowl?
<CrimsonPhoenix> GODDAMN FURBIES
<MASF123> Oh yes! :3
<pony_4042> Eh, kids eat Playdough and Press Dough. Pretty much the same thing.
<Pearly> I should finish my drawing of pearly, I am making her wear a dress and she is all mad about it.. And rarity made it for her but she doesn't like it
<Rommulus> you can do it
<Cypresswolf> Agrold: Well it does say non toxic
<NullRadix> Tovler: assumedly when you turned 18 or so. If that hasn't happened, ignore said assumptions of being an adult.
<Ravebrony> Furbies?....oh god :D
<DocSane> The power of Celestia compels you!
<Ravebrony> Those things....
<Rommulus> everything was peaceful
<NullRadix> But always remember, growing old is mandatory. Growing up is optional. Acting your age is situational
<Rommulus> until the rainbow nation attacked
<alexxm> and then the rainbow nation attacked
<Shamroc> rawr
<cow334> woot woot
<Rommulus> rawrteh goes sperk da dergern
<DocSane> Celesta: "Well, that was unexpected..."
