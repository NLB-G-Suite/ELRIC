<ShyBetaFemale> we don't eve have COPS
<ShyBetaFemale> even*
<Vivix> Aww Yeah chaisse lounge
<TheRandomkid321> I love this music ^_^
<ShyBetaFemale> what are you listening to? :D
<Vivix> Yeah, I like norwegian TV, but if I lived alone, I probably would not have a TV
<ShyBetaFemale> i'm listening to the project X soundtrack
<TheRandomkid321> ShyBetaFemale The game music
<ShyBetaFemale> what is the game music
<Mutterguy> I got mah tv right <3
<Mutterguy> *here
<Vivix> Hehe, I don't really use consoles either, so- I wouldn't need one
<ShyBetaFemale> i don't even play video games much anymore
<ShyBetaFemale> except for minecraft once maybe a week
<Vivix> I only do if something new and cool comes out-
<ShyBetaFemale> morning Lil_B
<Vivix> like, I played dishonored like a bitch, and borderlands on weekends, but- before then didn't really play at all for a while
<Lil_B> thanks ShyBetaFemale :)
<ShyBetaFemale> :D
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Soap
<Lil_B> and hio everyone :)
<TheRandomkid321> ShyBetaFeamle WAIT! It's humanly possible to go a day without Minecraft!?
*Vivix eats soap and sulks
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Lil_B :3
<Vivix> I stopped playing minecraft around beta 1.1
<Vivix> stopped playing tekkit a few months ago
<ShyBetaFemale> TheRandomkid321 when i first got minecraft pre alpha i played every day, 8 hours, for 2 months straight
<Lil_B> I see NewSuperBronyU is trying to make his performance better in this level xD
<Lil_B> hey AdamTheDuck :)
<Vivix> Ah alpha, nostalgia
<ShyBetaFemale> once the halloween update came in, i started losing interest, and now i just play technic pack and yogbox
<ShyBetaFemale> YA d00d! back when you didn't have to draw your bow back hahahaha
<Mutterguy> i thikn he's just playing it for the theme music
<Vivix> I played technic pack for the horses-
<Vivix> Hehehe, the bow was waesome back then
<Vivix> awesome*
<ShyBetaFemale> i wish the technic pack had the millenaire mod
<TheRandomkid321> This game reminds me of the NES/SNES games where when you die its BACK TO THE START OF THE LEVEL FOR YOU YOU PEICE OF S#IT!
<Vivix> I play the oudated one
<ShyBetaFemale> that's the only reason i'm still using yogbox
<Mutterguy> Vivix i've been playing aronud with that recently
<Vivix> Technic 0.6.7, with millenaire and mo-creatures
<Lil_B> yeah, Minecraft Alpha was fun, nothing but Mining and cutting Trees and the accasional killibng of Pigs for Meat :)
<Vivix> aw yeah
<ShyBetaFemale> yogbox still has millenaire and mo creatures and a bunch of other stuff
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, hehe, back in the day when you couldn't sleep at night in Minecraft :$
<MadSurge> This again? :D
<Vivix> Mutterguy, it is pretty fun, when you feel done with vanilla-
<Vivix> <,< yeah, you had to hide in a cave for 5 minutes
<Mutterguy> I kinda found out you don't bother copper wire
<Lil_B> The only Mod I reaslly used was tzhe shader Mod, but it doesn't work since the full release :(
<Mutterguy> *with
*MadSurge whistles
<ShyBetaFemale> man minecraft was so simple back then
<ShyBetaFemale> now there is all this stuff in it, which is cool, but idk i just don't care about it
<Lil_B> Back when Gold was 100% useless xD
<TheRandomkid321> ShyBetaFemale Yeah...
<Vivix> It was, mine all night, build all day, and the FIRE
<ShyBetaFemale> LOL exactly Lil_B
<Vivix> man I burnt down our entire town due to an accident. It was so aggressive back then
<AdamTheDuck> Haha, ikr Lil_B :D
<ShyBetaFemale> yeah the fire was awesome
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, Oh god the fire XD
<ShyBetaFemale> i just realized how aggressive it really was
<Vivix> I hear that's back in 1.3 hardmode, though
<AdamTheDuck> I miss the old fire mechanics
<ShyBetaFemale> the old fire mechanics are terrifying
<Vivix> It was scary and awesome
<ShyBetaFemale> one little slip up with a fireplace, and there goes hours of house work
<TheRandomkid321> Oh you accidentally put only 1 block on fire to your house? LET ME FIX THAT FOR YOU! Oh you wanted it put out? TO F#CKING BAD!
<AdamTheDuck> Terrifying... But AWESOME /)^3^(\
<Vivix> And since, during that period at least, leafs didn't decay, we used it to clean up after foresting
<Mutterguy> nothing like a good forest fire to stir the soul
<ShyBetaFemale> dude yes
<ShyBetaFemale> i always made tree houses
<ShyBetaFemale> grew giant forests and turned them into a big home
<Vivix> aww yeah
<ShyBetaFemale> no fire with me ever hahahahaha
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Lil_B> Vivix yeah, I still rtemember on some servers with rules like "Clean up all the leafes after cutting down a tree!"
<Vivix> You can't quite get that new feeling back. You know, discovering redstone, and finding your first underground lake
<Vivix> yeaah
<TheRandomkid321> To be fair I never actually played alpha. But It was the version I love most. It's what I first saw of the game. I started playing as soon as beds came out.
<TheRandomkid321> Beta 1.3 I do believe.
<Lil_B> I even use the Alpha Texturte Pack xD
<Mutterguy> nice one SB
<ShyBetaFemale> i remember my first world on minecraft
<Vivix> I startedp laying shortly after halloween update I think
<ShyBetaFemale> it had the biggest cave i had ever found, weeks exploring it and i still wasn't finished
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, omg, back in the day when the shading was done in blocks rather than the smooth shading!
<Vivix> I wish we could get our first world back, we had one world up to the adding of..jungles I think, from alpha to beta I think
<ShyBetaFemale> then i cut through a small wall and BOOM a new cave
<Vivix> so it had all our towns, and no mods
<Vivix> Yes!
<AdamTheDuck> Oh man so much nostalgia
<ShyBetaFemale> morning Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate!
*AdamTheDuck licks Gold_Demona
<AdamTheDuck> Morning Gold_Demona :P
<Lil_B> good morniong Gold_Demona :)
<Gold_Demona> lol hi
<Vivix> I think caves were a bit bigger too in alpha, they just went on forver
<ShyBetaFemale> yeah
<Gold_Demona> dat Rayman
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona! You're just in time!
<ShyBetaFemale> and there were less biomes
<Gold_Demona> madSurge: For what?
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix Yours don't?
<ShyBetaFemale> if it snowed, THE WHOLE WORLD SNOWED
<Vivix> Sadly, not anymore
<Vivix> Hehe
<TheRandomkid321> I have a cave i've been exploring for a month. I once got lost in their with full diamond gear for a week.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: for the best level ever :D
<Vivix> I can't remember why we updated our world, but it was some new feature
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Heh!
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix Larger biomes?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Wow
<Vivix> TheRandomkid321, nice, haven't really been on cave exploring for ages
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02How did I die? o3o
<Lil_B> Vivix back then caves where awesomely long, now thy end fast after you find an abandoned mine or the underground cliffs
<PeachStreak> goodnight everypony see ya later :) <3
<Gold_Demona> That was an odd death
<Vivix> I can't remember- it was something that wouldn't work unless you updated your worldsave
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night PeachStreak :)
<AdamTheDuck> Bye PeachStreak
<Lil_B> bye PeachStreak :)
<TheRandomkid321> Vivix Dungeons?
<Vivix> I think..yes
<Gold_Demona> I like how there's stuff going on in the extreme foreground. XD
<Vivix> We had a town, where we constructed a huge wall around and lit up all the insides, to be safe from mods
<Vivix> no mods- just mining and building- and we lost interest when we updated worldsave, because- we lost all our work
<ShyBetaFemale> ouch
<Gold_Demona> Lot of memorization involved with this game I see.
<Jmo> DEMAAAA
<Gold_Demona> Moojayyyyyy!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: only in this level
<Jmo> Howsit?
<TheRandomkid321> I got a free shirt with Xcom Enemy unknown ^_^ my fav game as of current.
<TheRandomkid321> Minecraft doesn't count.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the rest of the game is more like classic platformers
<Gold_Demona> Ish good. Been playing a lot of Pok?mon White 2 and Star Wars The Old Republic. :3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ah, I see
<Jmo> Ah I see
<Jmo> Tis good
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: This is one of those where in the classic era winds up being one of those "infamous levels" that everybody talks about.
<Lil_B> ohey MadSurge :)
<Vivix> http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697813 the great wall we had before updating worldsave
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Yep
<ShyBetaFemale> i remember when sandstone was first introduced, i spent 2 days building a massive temple in the desert
<Lil_B> Vivix I knmow this texturte pack :P
<Vivix> Hehe
<ShyBetaFemale> IN HONOR OF THE MIGHTY GOD RA
<Wrek> 05i jsut learned a new insult
<Vivix> Whenever there was a big update, we would venture out and make a new time in freshly generated chunks
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: this is a bonus level you have to unlock through 10 other difficult levels, so you asked for it :D
<Vivix> so that was our last city before dungeons
<AdamTheDuck> Oh do share your findings with us Wrek :3
<Wrek> 05"You are as dense as depleted uranium"
<MadSurge> Wrek: :D
<Lil_B> Wrek do you Pirate Music or do you Viking it?
<Wrek> 05gotta remember that one
<Wrek> 05i spotify it
<ShyBetaFemale> how do you viking music?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL I see. I'd probably never make it this far. Mostly because I'm not NEARLY as patient with video games as I used to. XP
<ShyBetaFemale> do i even want to know...
<Vivix> Spotify > piracy
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: If the game is good, my patience is limitless
<AdamTheDuck> Free music > spotify
<ShyBetaFemale> we have no torrents in germany
<ShyBetaFemale> so i have to look for the uploaded rars
<ShyBetaFemale> feels bad man
<Lil_B> I ddon't think Spotify has the music I want ^^"
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: This is true. If the game is good enough, I can go on almost forever.
<Vivix> It has most of the things I like
<Vivix> but I mainly listen to--hipster crap I guess
<Wrek> 05torrents arent illegal
<ShyBetaFemale> what kind of music do you listen to Vivix
<Wrek> 05torrents with illegal data are illegal
<Wrek> 05lets ban CD's cause they may contain illegal files
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: But if the game starts pissing me off, I'm MUCH less persistent with it as I used to be.
<Vivix> Noise, Alterna, Shoegaze, VK- sub pop- indie pop- skranglepop- stuff
<Wrek> 05lets ban hard drives casue they CAN contain illegal data
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: btw, I have Black version 2, but first I would like to do more stuff in the post final boss Black Version
<ShyBetaFemale> ok the only one i have ever listened to is noise haha
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, /)
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: you will probably use that or atleast thnk of a moment to us that insult before the end of the week
<Lil_B> Wrek let's ban RAM because the illigal Data goes though them
<Vivix> (\
<Jmo> Vivix, our tastes are not the same. Ish ovah.
<AdamTheDuck> Although I hahve no idea what shoegaze is Vivix :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also, Rayman having infinite lives is really convenient
*Vivix holds on to Jmo
<Vivix> Noo don't go
<Phase4> Wrek, lets ban people remembering things
<Jmo> ;~;
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes, I like infinite lives.
<Phase4> they might be able to repeat things they've seen that are copywrite
<Vivix> Shoegaze is--think My Bloody Valentine, Blur(kinda)--Ringo Deathstarr- maybe a bit of Jesus and Mary Chain
<Lil_B> Let's sue everyone who is whislteing a tune
<Wrek> 05as for me
<Vivix> it's basically stems from artists not moving on stage, just standing there glaring at their pedals
<Lil_B> whistle*
<Wrek> 05spotify provides all the music i want
<Wrek> 05new albums of my favorite artists etc
<Vivix> Pretty much same here
<Wrek> 05except maybe one or two songs that i easely find via youtube
<Wrek> 05or pony music
<Vivix> Spotify is pretty damn great, AND isn't piracy. I still buy albums I love, but yeah
<ShyBetaFemale> i'm into breakcore like venetian snares, aphex twin, datach'i, jazz fusion stuff and anything with mike patton in it
<Wrek> 05otehr than that spotify sates my needs
<ShyBetaFemale> i love me some mike patton unf unf unf
<Vivix> I kinda like Venetian Snares and Aphex
<Vivix> I like some electronic stuff, but it's not what I listen to the most
<ShyBetaFemale> i LOVE venetian snares i have most of his music
<Wrek> 05good news ShyBetaFemale: spotify has mike patton
<Vivix> At the moment I'm addicted to Animal Collective, woo
<ShyBetaFemale> so does google wrek :P
<ShyBetaFemale> idk if germany even has spotify here
<Lil_B> ShyBetaFemale you are german too?
<Vivix> He needs money to eaat
<ShyBetaFemale> yeah, well half
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So close ;~;
<Wrek> 05spotify exists more or less everywhere
<Vivix> Yeah, it's more or less international at this point
<ShyBetaFemale> ah ok
<ShyBetaFemale> well i have no use for it
<Lil_B> ShyBetaFemale just made a google search, they have it in german appearently
<Wrek> 05heck they even have game soundtracks and even got miracle of sound
<ShyBetaFemale> i'll just stick to "album name rar download"
<Wrek> 05they got my vote
<Vivix> I don't like piracy, because artists need money, and so do their labels and representatives
<Petrified_Discord> Piracy. Yarr.
<AdamTheDuck> arrrrg
<Wrek> 05spotify gives money directly to the artist aswell
<Wrek> 05<3
<Vivix> Yeah, and it supports a lot of indie artists and obscure artists as well
<Wrek> 05while downloading a rar does neitehr
<ShyBetaFemale> i like buying music from artists that own their own labels like patton or devin townsend
<ShyBetaFemale> good lord devin townsend <3
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: don't go back to the start again! :D
<Vivix> Devin is cool, haven't listened to a lot
<Vivix> but labels are usually nice people, so I don't mind paying them either
<ShyBetaFemale> he released a new album called epicloud, it's like really happy pop metal
<ShyBetaFemale> soooo awesome
<Vivix> I liked hummer
<Vivix> was that the name?
<ShyBetaFemale> haha yeah
<MadSurge> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<ShyBetaFemale> my favorite album by him is deconstruction
<ShyBetaFemale> it's so gnarly
<Vivix> Hehe, I rarely listen to metal, so I only know him by proxy, and his ambient stuff
<Vivix> Very talented and inspirational dude, though
<ShyBetaFemale> oh for sure, i use devin townsend to get non metal fans into metal lmao
<AdamTheDuck> Mfw I realised I have torrented anything in months and have been fine listening to "free" artists and pony music .-.
<AdamTheDuck> I haven't*
<ShyBetaFemale> through devin townsend i got my 14 year old sister into black metal and fantomas
<Vivix> I haven't downloaded music for years- I have downloaded thigns like VK Demos, that I just can
<Vivix> t find anymore
<Wrek> 05folkmetal and powermetal ftw
<Wrek> 05IN MY SWORD I TRUST
<ShyBetaFemale> i know only a little folk and power metal
<Vivix> I listened to black metal when I was 13, but I moved on to visual kei/pop ish when I was 14
<Gold_Demona> folkmetal? O_o
<TheRandomkid321> I'm sniffing coke.
<Vivix> Never really returned-
<MadSurge> You like this level, don't you NewSuperBronyU :3
<ShyBetaFemale> black metal is so awesome when the artists don't take themselves very seriously
<ShyBetaFemale> like immortal
<Wrek> 05Gold_Demona: ill make sure to play some folkmetal ocne i stream again :P
*AdamTheDuck steals TheRandomkid321's coke .-.
<Vivix> Yeah, most I've met are..nice people
<Gold_Demona> Wkre: kk :3

<Lil_B> we should Stream the 60's Afri Cola Commercial here xD
<Vivix> I do listen to some heavy music, but not really metal anymore. But I have heard a lot of Devin, since I play with a guy who loooves him
*TheRandomkid321 thanks... throws water away
<ShyBetaFemale> i don't like soda that much anymore
<tykk> bronys are fagets
<ShyBetaFemale> i have none in my fridge, just milk
<Vivix> I know dear
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: there's nothing different if you do it in one life!
<Lil_B> I really don't like Songs with Lyrics, it's always ether the Voice, the Text, or the way it doesn't fit with the rest that annoys me
<Lil_B> but the few actual Songs I like are extremly high up on my Favourits List :)
<AdamTheDuck> Come on TheRandomkid321, you read the Zombie Apocalypse Survival Guide, you know that caffeine dehydrates you. :|
<ShyBetaFemale> the zombie survival guide also claims zombies can't climb and then says zombies can climb
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck... Yes I suppose.
<Vivix> I prefer lyrics, but I really like instrumentals too
<ShyBetaFemale> so uh...
<TheRandomkid321> ShyBetaFemale Which one did you read?
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, please tell me you like post rock. :<
<ShyBetaFemale> whichever it was i read it years ago
<Vivix> I doo, as far as I know
<Vivix> I'm bad at genre names
<TheRandomkid321> I ahev the one published last year. So I don't have taht fact.
<ShyBetaFemale> i like explosions in the sky and god is an astronaut :D
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, gimme another one. /)
<Vivix> (\ aww yeaah
<Lil_B> Still about 9ß% of my Music is from Games, and generally everything cann be there, Hip Hop, Rap, Metal, Ragtime, Jazz Orchestral, Chiptune... It's just everything xD
<Vivix> I think the--metalliest thing I've seen live is probably Like rats from a sinking ship, or parts of monolithic
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: which starter did you pick for B/W?
<Mutterguy> i saw meatloaf live
<Vivix> Like rats is- fun live, they threw a moog synth and a nord synth in a pile of glass and beer
<ShyBetaFemale> i met paul gilbert once
<Vivix> I--hope it didn't break
<Lil_B> I wish I could go to the Cologne_Soundtrack Concert, they have a freaking Video Game Music Workshop with som,,e awesome Composers
<Vivix> Nice
<Vivix> I rarely listen to game music- not sure why
<TheRandomkid321> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/7/31/HV3n0agluU-pfi6hFObm4Q2.jpg What's wrong with this picture? The Docter is not there.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Well for the first one, I cheated and gave myself my regular team that I play most of my games with. The second game I'm playing it straight, so I picked the piggy. :3
<Jmo> Docter.
<Gold_Demona> MadSUrge: Her name is Bacon
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: hur hur hur :D

<TheRandomkid321> Petrified_Discord how do you tell?
<ShyBetaFemale> rarity is cool, i like all of them but fluttershy, she ain't my cup of tea
<Petrified_Discord> TheRandomkid321: A mod posted it in-chat and I saved it
<TheRandomkid321> Petrified_Discord Any Australian ones?
<taoumi> ever mark the wrong side of some thing then you have one of those 'damn it' moments where you have to start again and waist material?
<Petrified_Discord> TheRainbowDawn: Eenope

<TheRandomkid321> Petrified_Discord both :| and GODDAMNIT!
<Lil_B> ShyBetaFemale well, I actually only really like Twi and Rarity, after that maybe RD, Fluttershy than AJ and PP
<Vivix> I think I like Fluttershy Pinkie and Rarity the most
<Petrified_Discord> TheRandomkid321: I think it only matters when they stream movies and open the smaller chatrooms. I often join through a random server anyway.
<ShyBetaFemale> lol DoctoDoctorWho i just don't like her
<Petrified_Discord> Regardless of choosing RD

<Phase4> so who has magicka?
<Lil_B> ShyBetaFemale ... at least you saved the money for food ...
<Phase4> need 3 players
<Jmo> Neither have I/
<Petrified_Discord> Cats always look at me like I'm an idiot. I don't know how to impress them. I don't think I can.
<Jmo> :>
<Phase4> one of you must have it :<
<ShyBetaFemale> Lil_B he used to be so fat
<Mutterguy> I think i own it....
<LightTrooper105> hmm
<Vivix> I have it, and I have a new internet
<Jmo> Liar.
<Phase4> wow, missile silos are expencive
<ShyBetaFemale> Petrified_Discord you can't impress cats, they are cats, they are designed for old ladies
<Mutterguy> not installed because of small HDD issues
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my previous cat was like that. My current cat likes going outside :)
<Lil_B> "I THINK I own this game" ... we are all way woo wealthy -.-
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Mutterguy> no that was just steam sales
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Whether my cats want to or not is irrelevant. We don't let our cats outside.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase4: pshaw, you can get one for just under 1.4 million dollars
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but she doesn't like sitting on laps. Just close to sitting people :D
<Petrified_Discord> ShyBetaFemale: I would have thought opposable thumbs would be good enough. It's like, I can HOLD things. Hey cat, can you get the phone? No? You can't because you're a cat? Okay then.
<Phase4> DoctoDoctorWho, 6_9
<ShyBetaFemale> cats don't care about holding things Petrified_Discord hahaha :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: do you live on a dangerous zone? O_o
<LightTrooper105> I see Magika o.o
<Vivix> Guy on JS chat on Stackoverflow- asking a question, that is so vague, that it sounds more like a statement
*Vivix wat do
<ShyBetaFemale> awwww i'm so proud of my little sister
<Jmo> Hurt him.
<Phase4> Vivix, whats the question
<Lil_B> I'm playing Retro City Rampage now, I'll see if it somehow allows me to pop in the chat
<ShyBetaFemale> she was starting to gain weight and i lectured her on how to lose weight and since may she's lost like 20 lbs
<Vivix> "how do I give 200, 300, 20, 50 in percentage?" and I'm like wat? and he says "Whether we can take x1=200,y1 = 300 and so on" and..I have no ida what he actually means
<Phase4> ......
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Kinda. But more than that, we worked too hard to rid our house of fleas when we bought it. Also we don't want them catching whatever diseases might be out there from other animals.
<LightTrooper105> wut o.o..
<Vivix> Does he want to know how to ..turn numbers into percentage?..Wat?
<Phase4> Vivix, thats not only vague, its imposible to answer
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also the risk of them getting run over by a car
<Petrified_Discord> Vivix: Dafuq?
<Vivix> Yeah- I'm stuck
<Jmo> LOL
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Or picked up by somebody else
<Jmo> IMPOSSIBRU
<Petrified_Discord> Vivix: Just link him to "ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Phase4: the government is selling old nuclear launch silo's to the public as refurbished houses, with all the important bits taken out of course.
<Lil_B> Vivix yeah... you need more Information too rewsolve this Problem -.-
<Vivix> hehe yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Ehh screw homework, I'll leave it for later :$
<AdamTheDuck> Still playing Magicka Phase4?
<Petrified_Discord> AdamTheDuck: /)
<Phase4> DoctoDoctorWho, think i read about that
<AdamTheDuck> Petrified_Discord, (\
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also, they don't know how to live outside.
<LightTrooper105> I want to play Magika now..
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, havent played in a while
<Phase4> LightTrooper105, fire it up, i'm playing multiplayer
<Lil_B> ok, I can't pop in the chat :/

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: They've been indoor cats since they were born
<Mutterguy> Sorrry Phase4 need to uninstall stuff in order to play :(

<DoctoDoctorWho> :|
<Phase4> one sec
<Phase4> alligning things
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I've seen her catch a few birds, but nothing special. And our vet is a wonderful person
<Vivix> He needs it in percentage, to support ipad, and android tablets
<LightTrooper105> hmm
*Vivix shrugs
<Petrified_Discord> Vivix: So like...decimals? Dafuq is this kid talking about?
<AdamTheDuck> Fuuuuuuuuuu, I didn't back up Magicka Phase4 :(
<Phase4> :(
<Vivix> I'm not sure- I think he might be using a library that gives him a function- he says eh: var ball=new entity(1,'ball',200,300,20,50,100,'red',0,10,0,10,0,true,false,0,true,1,0.95,'','??balls/bone.png');

<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: have you played RA2 Yuri's revenge?
<LightTrooper105> that what I did
<Jmo> Oh when did it get an update

<Mutterguy> ha just freed up space from mass effect
<LightTrooper105> wth..
<LightTrooper105> my game just close it self..
<Phase4> and then it seized up
<taoumi> dat sims talk
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: does your husband still play?
<MadSurge> taoumi: ikr
<Vivix> Magicka is funny sometimes if you know Swedish
<LightTrooper105> lol my char still there
<LightTrooper105> when im not xD
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Nah, not so much anymore. It's collecting dust right now
<DoctoDoctorWho> shame, I would have loved to meet him in a match
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: He never plays MP
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: He usually just plays the campaign or one of the single-player maps.
<Mutterguy> DoctoDoctorWho <3 Ra2 but didn't really play it online
<Phase4> LightTrooper105, rejoin?
<LightTrooper105> sure
<Phase4> so Mutterguy and AdamTheDuck both need to install
<Phase4> its a race
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Phase4> winner gets to play
<Phase4> :>
<Jmo> How long do they have?
<AdamTheDuck> Knowing my unreliable internet, I have a feeling Mutterguy will win :$
<Mutterguy> fine I just clicked installl.
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: In fact, he's like me in that we never play online with other people if we can help it unless it's with each other or someone we know, and always in a team against computers.
<Phase4> as long as it takes
<Jmo> Till the end of time itself?
<Mutterguy> Unless the taupo super volcano goes or the local fault line does a biggy in the next 30 minutes i should be fine
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Which is why it took me so long to get into TF2. I don't like playing with random people. XP
<Jmo> I'm gonna be done in 7~ minutes
<Jmo> so lul.
<MadSurge> Best part about Magicka is griefing your friends :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: the only thing I dont like about online play is you have to be godly at the game just to avoid getting slaughtered
<Spark> w..t..f i try again to join my magicka when i do it shuts itself down :D
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah, that's another reason why we don't play with random people. We both suck. =/
<Jmo> Co-op4eva
<taoumi> have they killed them selves yest?
<Spark> any1 does know how i can repair it? :)
<AdamTheDuck> Spark, are you playing on a laptop?
<Spark> nope
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's why TF2 is better than Call of Duty, you can have tons of fun even if you're a scrub :D
<Spark> it just laggs that it cant run it even i did the so called ''install''
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gold_Demona: Im sure you dont suck, its just 90% of people online have sold their souls to the game and do nothing else:D
<Spark> :)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: This is true. Though TF2 is the only FPS online game I've ever played. lol
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: that too
<Mutterguy> 233 mb\
<Gold_Demona> DoctoDoctorWho: Well, I've never played C&C, so I'm sure I'd suck at that lol.
<Phase4> um
<AdamTheDuck> So much lag Phase4 XD
<AdamTheDuck> Everyone is just teleporting
<Spark> i bet that i need just delete 1 thing what i cant find :D
<Vivix> you can probably check game integrity
<Vivix> if you have it on steam
<Jmo> Oh PvZ Sequel
<Spark> i tryed youtube it tells to go into pb where i wont go :/
<DoctoDoctorWho> I remember when I first played the game, AI was on easy and kicked my @$$ every time
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: srsly?! :O
<Mutterguy> i bet it's with hats and you have to get it through origins
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: there's a macro summing it up best: "30 shots to the face, he kills you first; knife to the foot, instant death" :D
<Jmo> It was announced in August too. wow o.o
<Jmo> How'd that slip past
<Vivix> CnC AI was ruthless
<Vivix> I think they start witha built base in the early ones, because they can't build on their own , only repair and rebuild
<Vivix> something like that-
<Vivix> in skirmish, not campaign
<Gold_Demona> Oh yeah... EA owns PopCap now... FFFUUUUUUUUU
<Jmo> Yeah..
<Jmo> >.>
<AdamTheDuck> Yay Magicka is done
<Mutterguy> curses!
<Jmo> Ah well, will be interesting to see what they're gonna do.
<Mutterguy> Mr duck , you win
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: the AI doesnt match my playstyle though
<Gold_Demona> But I don't wanna buy through Origin! T^T
<Gold_Demona> Origin sucks bawls
<Vivix> Same, I like to just build and build and do diplomatics
<Jmo> Ah don't worry
<Jmo> You'll be able to buy it through Steam I'm sure.
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: But I though Steam wasn't gonna cary EA games anymore.
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: That's why you can't get Mass Effect 3 on there
<Vivix> if EA makes more money with Steam, they are basically forced to- but seems they don't want to
<Jmo> Look at Crysis 2
<Jmo> It was removed then put back on
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, this is from "15 things you'll never hear a gamer say" http://derpy.me/J9SYA
<Vivix> EA needs all the money they can get-
<Jmo> But yeah
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: But none of EA's new games are on Steam.
<Jmo> Origin
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: Im a turtle, so by the time im up to full steam Im either dead or the AI has no fight left in it.
<Jmo> wattajoke
<Jmo> Touche.
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho, aw yeah. Have you ever played eh Rise of Nations? It kinda suited that slow build style-
<Gold_Demona> Maybe it'll pop up on BigFish... The first game is on there, so why not?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ill have to check it out
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, and this one you might understand more. http://derpy.me/UPORI
<Jmo> lawl
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: lol
<MadSurge> Why does everyone hate Garbodor? :(
<Gold_Demona> It'll be nice if I can buy it through BigFish. Here's hoping. *crosses fingers*
<Jmo> Honestly if it isn't on Steam, EA can rot in hell and I will cry like a little girl.
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: cuz he's a piece of trash...
<DoctoDoctorWho> hehehe
<AdamTheDuck> NewSuperBronyU, if you're not asleep yet :P http://derpy.me/5HOT3
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: but he's cute :(
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I'm not holding my breath for it to be on Steam. If it DOES end up on Steam, I'd be very pleasantly surprised.
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: complete garbage
<Jmo> A MAN CAN DREAM ;__;
*Jmo rolls around crying
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: That's why I'm hoping it'll be available on BigFish
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: what about the giant pile of sludge and the bubble of toxic gas?
<Phase4> we suck
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, Mutterguy: either of you ready?
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: which ones
<DoctoDoctorWho> ?*
<Mutterguy> eenope
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: Grimer/Muck and Koffing/Wheezing
<Jmo> Still annoyed that console versions of the first one got co-op but not PC. QQ
<Gold_Demona> Tiem 4 berkferst. brb
<DoctoDoctorWho> MadSurge: I dont like them either, but my bro had a muk that he adored
<taoumi> nice thing about makeing a pony that's not for comision. it dosen't have to be flawless
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: There's coop? O.o
<MadSurge> Those are poison too but they get not even half of the shit that Garbodor had to go through :(
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, eeyup
<DoctoDoctorWho> raised the damn thing to lvl 70
<Jmo> Console versions have it yeah :<
<Phase4> k
<Phase4> i'll go after this

<AdamTheDuck> Haha, my friend gave me the biggest scare concerning Halo 4.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm more of a Platformer and RPG guy.
<AdamTheDuck> He was like: Dude, they fixed Halo man, don't worry. They added irong sights.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, and also, bullet hell/danmaku.
<XAX> Lol.
<AdamTheDuck> And I shat my pants XD

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: apparently it will be available for all things with Android
<Jmo> Poor Dema
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I have no Android
<Gold_Demona> My phone is a RAZR
<Jmo> HOHOHOHOHOHO
<Gold_Demona> The OLD one that's not a smartphone
<Jmo> RAZR
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: awww :( go play Adventure Ponies then
<Jmo> I still remember having one of those. My god
<d3rb> wow those things
<Gold_Demona> My phone is not a smart pony. :<
<d3rb> but it flips!
<Jmo> flip phones are bad-ass.
<Gold_Demona> True. That it does. :D
<d3rb> iphone does not flip
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<d3rb> therefore, better
<Gold_Demona> And my phone sits nicely on my phone-holder that looks like a couch. :P
<d3rb> why would you ever want to upgrade then?
<Gold_Demona> I don't. It just makes me sad when things like this come out and I can't play them. :<
*Jmo hugs Gold_Demona
<Jmo> There there, you will get to enjoy it sometime.
<Gold_Demona> Maybe, Jmo. Maybe
<d3rb> jmo should give you one of his surplus devices :P
<Gold_Demona> But I think my phone will live forever. XD
<Gold_Demona> I've had it for years
<Jmo> Eh
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<Jmo> Can get an Android phone for cheapest of $50 here
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, you can get them pretty cheap here too, but the trick is adding the smartphone data service to my phone plan
<Gold_Demona> Right now I have talk and text on my plan. Data is extra.
<Jmo> Huzzah
<Gold_Demona> Huzzah?
<Gold_Demona> O.o
<Jmo> >.>
<Jmo> I dunno
<Jmo> I r bored ;~;
<Vivix> I use Wifi, but all the phoneservices automatically include minimum data plan
<Vivix> in this country that is- as far as I know
<Gold_Demona> I'm stuck trying to come up with names for my characters in TOR. >.>
<Jmo> <.<
<Gold_Demona> I keep getting booted from server cuz I'm idle too long trying to think of a name
<d3rb> i have more data than i need, if i could i'd lend you some Gold_Demona
<Jmo> My lord Dema >.<
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Wut Jmo? O.o
<Jmo> It's a name D:
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, but names are hard. :<
<Gold_Demona> I want to make good names...
<Jmo> Silly silly silly dema.
<Gold_Demona> I suck at making good names...
<Vivix> The only place where names are totally--mean are games like Skryim and whatnot, you enver hear your name again
<Gold_Demona> I only know how to make silly names...
<Vivix> yet, you spend 20 minutes -
<Jmo> :<
<Vivix> <,< I once went through fallout1 with a char named 'name'
<d3rb> make your name srs_demona
<Gold_Demona> LOL Vivix. XD
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Gold_Demona> lol d3rb, That's not gonna work. XD
<d3rb> but people will see the srs and know you mean business
<Vivix> What kinda names do they use on--TOR?
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Jmo> Bounty hunter? I'd call it Derphunter.
<Jmo> Woop
*Vivix is not sure what that is, or if that was what was typed
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I liked making names for all my Pokemon :D
<Jmo> TOR - The old republic.
<Vivix> Aah
<Gold_Demona> Same as most MMOs. They're not usernames, but character names.
<Vivix> I haven't watched enough star wars to know any naming patterns-
<Vivix> but it's always fun to get a name that sounds..like it belongs
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<MadSurge> Vivix: ikr
<Gold_Demona> That's why it's so hard for me. I have a REALLY hard time finding names that belong to the characters. :<
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I ALWAYS name my pok?mon. :3
<MadSurge> My names are either punny or serious :D
<MadSurge> No obscenities
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, Pok?mon names are a lot easier. Anything goes.
<Gold_Demona> My starter in White 2 is named Bacon. :3
<Vivix> Hehe
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I had one named Zebrandrea :D
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Vivix> I've never played pokemon ;__;
<d3rb> :O
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: :O
<Vivix> and I LIKE naming pets, so maybe I should- but..battles
<Gold_Demona> What about battles?
<d3rb> but Vivix ...its sooo good!
<Vivix> I'm not so fond of battles-
<Gold_Demona> Why not?
*Vivix shrugs
<Jmo> World peace.
<Gold_Demona> It's just like any other rpg
<Vivix> I think it's just not my style of fighting in games-
<Vivix> I tend to stick to wrpg style
<Gold_Demona> wrpg?
<d3rb> Vivix used hug on roket grunt...it has no effect
<Vivix> or crpg, whichever name is right
<Jmo> You hate battles but you would slowly torture someone in Fallout
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Jmo> or burn down a city in Dishonored
<Vivix> Nuh huh!
<Vivix> Torture is baad
<Gold_Demona> crpg? O_o
<Vivix> <,<..that was an accident
<Jmo> Uh-huh
<Vivix> Computer rpg, like fallout or baldurs gate
<MadSurge> Vivix: you mean action rpgs?
<Jmo> UH-HUH
<Vivix> noot--actions per se
<Gold_Demona> Oh
<Jmo> LOL.
<d3rb> dat kick
<Vivix> woops
<Vivix> not action, but DnD'y
<d3rb> stratagy
<Vivix> I prefer BOATLOADS of dialog and walking over much combat, I guess
<d3rb> ?
<Jmo> HE LOVES FALLOUT STYLE GAMES
<Vivix> Not sure what it goes under-
<Jmo> NUFF SAID
<Vivix> yeah, fallout and baldurs gate
<MadSurge> I like Dungeon Crawlers too
<Vivix> but yeah, only pokemon I've tried was ehh..that stadium one, friend of mine ha
<Vivix> d
<Gold_Demona> LOL Stadium doesn't count
<d3rb> you mean the worst one
<Vivix> dungeon crawlers are fun too, like nethack or..dungeon master(name?)- legends of grimrock
<Vivix> it's THE worst?
<MadSurge> I liked Etrian Odyssey
<Jmo> Oi
<Jmo> It ain't the worst
<Vivix> <m< I need to download a emulator
<Gold_Demona> Nonono the REAL Pok?mon games have actual story to them
<d3rb> ok the camera one is the worst
<Vivix> Goodgood, because story is the best reason to play
<Gold_Demona> Not a lot of story, mind you, but enough to keep it interesting
<Jmo> Oi
<Jmo> Pokemon Snap was golden
<Jmo> You arse.
<d3rb> oh cmon, really?
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: No! The best was Hey You! Pikachu!
<Vivix> because I like pokemons, and I like reading pokemon fiction- especially feral, but never really played the games
<Jmo> AHAHA
<Jmo> Dema got it.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so B/W is an exception? because that one had quite a story
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, I was about to say, if you want story to start with Black or White
<Gold_Demona> 5th Gen is QUITE story intensive
<MadSurge> It's like fighting PETA :D
<Gold_Demona> LOL yup XD
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Well, then I might pick that one up
<Vivix> I'm not very familiar with pokemons, but yeah- I enjoy their visaage
<Jmo> POKEMANS.
<doctor_whooves127> black and white is the first game to get a sequal
<Jmo> sequal
<Gold_Demona> Keep in mind that Black and White are both pretty much exactly the same game but with a few different pok?mon.
<Vivix> aah
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: thought so
<Vivix> What eh..
<Vivix> platform is it for?
<Jmo> DS
*Vivix snaps fingers
<Gold_Demona> Yup DS
<Vivix> I don't like emulating new ish things, cause..you know, piracy
<Vivix> but--buying a ds <,< not sure-
<MadSurge> Vivix: watch out to not get the tweaked rom :D
<Gold_Demona> Oh, you don't have a DS...
<Jmo> ima buttpirate
<Jmo> yarhar
<Gold_Demona> Um...
<Vivix> I might try it out on emu and buy it if I like it- not sure what DS costs now adays
<Vivix> MadSurge, tweaked? D=
<Gold_Demona> That complicates matters cuz all the actual pok?mon games are on Gameboy or DS
<Jmo> ^
<Vivix> yeah, I kinda grew up without nintendo
<Gold_Demona> You poor poor soul. :<
*d3rb hugs Vivix
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> Pfffft
<Vivix> my dad was a complete computer nerd, and ironicly, my mother is and was a huuuge nintendo nerd
*Gold_Demona gives Vivix a muffin
<d3rb> everyone needs a LITLE bit of nintendo
<Vivix> so I grew up with computers
<Vivix> Mufffin
<MadSurge> Vivix: early roms had a safefail bug that made pirate copies not give you any experience
<Vivix> Aah
<Gold_Demona> I think I'm the only one who grew up with everything video games. I had a lot of different consoles AND computer games.
<MadSurge> I think that's the same for the other games too
<Gold_Demona> My dad was a huge gamer, so most of the computer games were his, but I played them anyway. :P
<Vivix> Hehe, we had a Sega Mega, as it was called in europe, and my mother would sometimes play a nintendo with mario, but I grew up playing computer and amiga games
<Gold_Demona> I actually didn't have any handheld games until the first Pok?mon came out.
<d3rb> same
<Jmo> dat ? >.>
<Gold_Demona> By then I was old enough to by my own gameboy, so that wasn't a big deal. :P
<Vivix> I've yet to own anything handheld, for games specifically
<d3rb> what was the point of owning one before that
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I had a NES, but didn't use it much because I was too little :D I played mostly arcade games and PC platformers
<Jmo> Game and Watch. ;__;
<Jmo> YOU'RE ALL CRUEL
<Vivix> Hehe
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: GameBoy :3
<Gold_Demona> I got an NES when I was like 4 or 5
<Gold_Demona> My family and I played the crap out of Duck Hunt and Super Mario Bros
<Vivix> dDuck Hunt!
<Gold_Demona> Hell yeah Duck Hunt
<Vivix> I used to play that at my uncles house
<Vivix> was always fascinated by how the gun worked
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my first GB game was the Killer Instinct port, which was quite good!
<d3rb> i still got my old nes
<Gold_Demona> I got a Sega Genesis some time later, so I grew up with Mario AND Sonic.
<MadSurge> And mind you, I hated fighting games back then
<Vivix> we had a sega mega, me and my sister, which was genesis in usa- but eh I don't think we had sonic
<Gold_Demona> I always liked fighting games, but I've never been any good at them. :P
<Sylandest> morning, everypony :)
<d3rb> hey Sylandest
<Vivix> You southern horse
<Gold_Demona> My sister still has our genesis.
<Vivix> Yp
<Vivix> yo* darnit
<Sylandest> howdy d3rb, Vivix :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Sylandest
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I've been always better at Final Fight style games :D
<Sylandest> howdy, Gold_Demona! :)
<MadSurge> Hello Sylandest!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The games I'm best at is puzzle games.
<Vivix> I still have our sega mega controller, but that's about it, dunno where the machine is
<Gold_Demona> are*
<Vivix> I prefer dialog heavy and talky games, not sure why
<Gold_Demona> I like most kinds of games
<Vivix> not really good at any games, but- still fun
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: those are good, but my fav games are still platformers :3
<Gold_Demona> I'm not overly picky
<MadSurge> ^
<d3rb> goodnight everypony :P take it easy
<Sylandest> howdy MadSurge!
<Sylandest> And what are we talking about today?
<Vivix> I'm not usually either, but- I think dialog heavy and good story kinda makes it stand ou to me, not sure
<Vivix> I mean, half life is one of my all time favs, and there's hardly no dialog-
<MadSurge> The only games I dislike are racing and sports videogames
<Gold_Demona> I love platformers! Especially the classic 2d ones
<Vivix> I think only I avoid are games like final fantasy and sports <,<
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I don't like sports games. Controls are too weird for me
<Jmo> Sif avoid FF games
<Gold_Demona> I used to love Final Fantasy.
<Jmo> Ish ovah veeveex.
<Jmo> </3
*Vivix hugs Jmo, wont let him go
<Jmo> So clingy.
<Vivix> I can see why people like theem but yeah
<Vivix> not for me- sadly
<Gold_Demona> Final Fantasy stopped being good after 10
<Jmo> Oh that hurts
<Gold_Demona> I love the stories in 6, 7, and 9
*Vivix strokes Jmo
<Gold_Demona> 8 was boring.
<Jmo> FF Movies are the bomb ;~;
<Gold_Demona> 12 was the last one I played and it was boring
<Vivix> I might only have played 7 or 8 and 11
*Jmo sits on Gold_Demona
<Jmo> Nu-uh
<Gold_Demona> 11's the MMO
<Vivix> okay not 11 then-
<Vivix> it had rikku, and some..girl..in black called payne or rayne
<Gold_Demona> That was 10-2
<Vivix> Ah yes
<Jmo> ^
<Gold_Demona> I like 10-2. It's fun in its own way
<Gold_Demona> And I kinda like the outfits, even if some of them are um... kinky. :P
<Vivix> I think the reason they're not for me is just because- my first meeting with games with that kinda gameplay was fairly late in my life
<Vivix> like --17 I think
<Jmo> Haay sexy laadies.
<Vivix> 16-
<Vivix> something like that
<Gold_Demona> Me too Vivix
<Gold_Demona> I didn't know Final Fantasy existed until I was like 15
<Jmo> wowza o.o
<Gold_Demona> Then I played 7 for the first time when I was 16
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah same here. Got to know some people in school who loved it so much, basically made me run check it out when 10-2 came ou
<Gold_Demona> 8 was the newest one when I started playing.
<Gold_Demona> I didn't play 8 till much much later, but it was there
<Vivix> Ah yeah
<Gold_Demona> I bought 9 when it came out and really liked it. Then I got 10 and really liked it. Then after that Final Fantasy went downhill...
<Vivix> My friend was totally addicted to Sephiroth, so she told me to play the one with him
<Gold_Demona> The stories ceased to be well-written
<Vivix> and I think a borrowed a black and white copy of it (piirates everywhere)
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Vivix> Ah yeah, in games it takes--a good story, not just flashy styles
<Vivix> or at least consistent quality
<Gold_Demona> Sephiroth's good as a villain, but he's WAY overrated.
<Panda> ^
<Vivix> Hehe, he's ERRYWHER
<Vivix> But yeah she was totally into him at the time-
<Jmo> I hate that ass in KH.
<Gold_Demona> He's not even the best Final Fantasy villain. He's only second best.
<Vivix> I never got that far as to meet him in the game, and don't really know any of the other villains-
<Gold_Demona> There has yet to be a villain more villainous than Kefka from 6
<Vivix> Kefka I've seen eh drawn art of, but that's about it
<Gold_Demona> That mofo was NUTS
<Gold_Demona> He sought out to destroy the world... On purpose... and succeeded.
<Vivix> !
<Jmo> I like nuts.
<Gold_Demona> Halfway through the game he completely fucks up the world
<Vivix> I'm suure you do
<Jmo> That didn't come out right.
<Jmo> At all.
<Vivix> THat sounds pretty cool
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, 6 was awesome
<Gold_Demona> That one was for Super Nintendo
<Vivix> I think it's mainly the gameplay that set me away, because it all sounds like something I'd love to read
<Gold_Demona> For me it's tied with 7 as best Final Fantasy
<Jmo> You gonna be getting the PC vesrion Dema? :O
<Jmo> version*
<Gold_Demona> PC Version of what Jmo? O_o
<Jmo> FF7
<Gold_Demona> Why? I have the original PS1 version. :P
<Jmo> Psshtt
<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo> Doesn't hurt
<Jmo> Plus there's achievements
<Jmo> Achieeveements D:
*Panda has both
<Gold_Demona> The only way I'd buy FF7 again is if they update the graphics to today's standard.
<Panda> wow
<Vivix> Get it on it fandom!
<Panda> the game was awesome as is
<Vivix> You did it to morrowind, you could do it again
<Jmo> Huh it's on special too
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Vivix> The water in Morrowind extended is superior to the shaders in skyrim-
<Vivix> it's..bizarre
<Gold_Demona> lol Achievements. Wow, that's SUCH a selling point. XD
<Jmo> :<
*Panda likes achievements
<Gold_Demona> I like achievements to, but that's not a selling point for me. :P
<Gold_Demona> too*
<Vivix> http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/forum/upload/Inny/Inny_1318587984_41808_1296411867.jpg
<Jmo> IT HAS PONIES IN IT
<Vivix> I like fun achievments- or strange ones
<Gold_Demona> Ponies?! Imma get it RIGHT NAO!
<Jmo> woopwoop.
<Vivix> FUP YEH
<Jmo> winrar
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Gold_Demona> lol
*Panda has a pony
<Gold_Demona> I still haven't played Pony Fantasy 6
<Panda> wait
<Panda> what?
<Jmo> LOL
<Panda> pony fantasy?
<Gold_Demona> I have it in my rom collection, but I've yet to play it
<Panda> omg
<Panda> link me now!
<Jmo> Wow it's legit
<Vivix> pony fantasy makes it sound dirty
<Panda> I must play it!
<Jmo> http://pony-fantasy-6.com/
*Vivix is just saying
<Panda> Vivix... my mind is always in the gutter anyways
<Jmo> Oh baby.
<Gold_Demona> Ohmai!
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Sounds cool
<Jmo> ima put you in one of those pony costumes Vivix for halloween
<Jmo> ahahaha
<Gold_Demona> But yeah, I know what you mean about taste in gameplay being a hinderance, Vivix.
<Gold_Demona> I can never get through Fire Emblem because I can't stand that "chess board" battle system.
<Gold_Demona> But I LOVE the story.
<Jmo> Oh my god Fire Emblem
<Jmo> Story is so good ;_;
<Vivix> Ah yes, things like that
<Gold_Demona> The one I have is the one with Ike
<Jmo> Gameplay as welll
*Vivix dances for Jmo in costume
<Jmo> ._.
<Jmo> You're too attached veeveex.
*Vivix stops
<Gold_Demona> Also the fact that characters die permanently was a huge turnoff for me
<Jmo> ish ovah D;
<Vivix> ;__; i soreh
<Gold_Demona> If they die in a fight, they're gone forever
<Vivix> Permadeaath
<Gold_Demona> So you BETTER NOT LET THEM DIE!!!
<naturesfury> what yall talking about now?
<Vivix> They had that in black and white, by lionhead, but one of the devs got so sad when his creature died, they disabled it
<Gold_Demona> Fire Emblem
<Jmo> Ponies
<naturesfury> ahh
<Jmo> LIES.
<naturesfury> thought u were talking about xcoim :(
<Jmo> lolxcom
<naturesfury> xcom*
<Gold_Demona> xcom?
<Vivix> no fir emblen and games in general
<Gold_Demona> What is xcom?
<naturesfury> hey its a good game damnit
<Vivix> XCOM was fun
<Jmo> Not even bothering to notice it
<Vivix> XCOM is like--fight aliens strategy old computer game
<Vivix> the only thing that confuses me is that I saw a repot on the upcoming one long ago thatl ooked amazing, yet the one that came out looks ..meh
<Gold_Demona> I see
<Vivix> what happened there?
<naturesfury> they just released a new xcom like 1-2 weeks ago
<Vivix> mid 90s typical computer game
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's one of those games where if you had one soldier killed and two injured with some loot it was a great match :D
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Vivix> Hehe, it was pretty fun, but- hard
<Vivix> I never really played it until recent times though, but the new one didn't grab any interest-
<MadSurge> Vivix: at least it's not the shitty FPS we saw months ago
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Gold_Demona> Anyone excited about the new KingsQuest game that TellTaleGames is supposedly coming out with?
<Jmo> Which FPS game?
<Jmo> Oh
<Jmo> igeddit
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: kinda :$
<Vivix> not familiar with kingsquest
<naturesfury> the ds one? or one for a console?
<Gold_Demona> I wonder if it's gonna be a retelling of the original KingsQuest lore or if it's gonna be an all new story.
<Jmo> Neither ;_;
<naturesfury> i must have a dif game in mind then
<MadSurge> Vivix: classic adventure game with tons of cheap deaths :D
<Vivix> Woop
<Gold_Demona> LOL yup
<Jmo> ah Sierra
<Jmo> I remember Gabriel Knight
<Vivix> Only thing I remember from Sierra is leisure suit Larry
<Jmo> AHAHAHA
<Vivix> and that's because--kids think that shit is funny
<Vivix> hehehe
<naturesfury> haha lsl....
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: did you see the bit with Twilight as Graham on Anthology 2? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yesh, I loved that bit. :3
<Gold_Demona> I recognized it immediately. :D
*Panda slaps Jmo around a bit with a large wub
<Gold_Demona> It's one of the first ridiculous deaths of the first KingsQuest game
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: PERFECT. Stupid death, obscure hint, rubbing it in your face.
*Jmo slaps Panda around a bit with a large trout
<Panda> :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL IKR?
<Jmo> A trout of love <3
<naturesfury> dem trouts get a workout it seems on this site
<Panda> Jmo, mind helping me out?
*Jmo slaps naturesfury around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> Only if Jmo is around. He's the one with the trouts
*Panda slaps Gold_Demona around a bit with a large trout
<Panda> wrong
<Jmo> With wut :o
<MadSurge> Did you try the recent remakes of the first three games?
<Jmo> Whatchu need sexay panda
<Panda> Jmo, I have art block....
<Gold_Demona> Jmo! He stole your trout! D:
<Jmo> osnap
<Jmo> Art block
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona ^
<Vivix> I wonder if I have a trout
*Vivix gives Jmo a hearty slap
<Jmo> Whatever shall you do D:
<Vivix> Not a trout it seems-
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: To be perfectly honest. I've never actually played any of them. But I've seen a full Let's Play series of all the games.
<Panda> like no joke, I could build a house with my art block Jmo.
<Jmo> And you're asking me for things to draw?
<Panda> eeyup
<Jmo> All I'm gonna scream at you is DERPY.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I think my dad had the first game, but I never made it very far in it. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the freeware remakes are good because you can't screw yourself over a puzzle because you used an item when you shouldn't have
<Jmo> Or draw a house
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's good.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, the early games were real DICKS about that
<Vivix> A lot of old games were totally unforgiving
<Gold_Demona> Yup
<Panda> Jmo, well derpy would be good... though... i dont have any ideas.... which just prolongs the block.
<Jmo> Derpy with the TARDIS :>
<Vivix> Derpy eating flowers while hitting Twilight with muffins
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: you get an instant death upon using it or there are multiple solutions to the puzzle.
<Gold_Demona> Panda: Derpy popping out of a muffin.
<Gold_Demona> Panda: Wearing a top hat
<Vivix> is KingsQuest a dungeon crawler?
<Vivix> *googlsz
<Gold_Demona> Panda: and a monocle
<naturesfury> derpy vs goku fighting for the muffen button = greatness
<Gold_Demona> Panda: And holding a cane
<Jmo> ew
<MadSurge> Vivix: nope, a point and click game series
<Vivix> Oooh~~
<Gold_Demona> Point and click adventure
<Panda> If I was in a comical mood, those would suffice.
<Vivix> Well, I still have to finish Monkey Island, but ever since broken sword, I've loved point and click
<Gold_Demona> Unless you're playing the first few games in their original form... In which case you type in what you want the character to do. XD
<Jmo> D:
<Vivix> Ooh, I kinda like that too. Like muds or..
<Vivix> stuff
<Vivix> go e go e go e go e you died
<Gold_Demona> If you want him to pick up the rock, you type in "pick up rock"
<MadSurge> Vivix: OOOH, Monkey Island <3
<Vivix> Hehe, indeed
<MadSurge> Vivix: can you hold your breath for 10 minutes?
<Jmo> Zork.
<Gold_Demona> LOL Wasn't Zork ALL text though. XD

<Gold_Demona> I've never even seen it in action, I only know about it by reputation
<Jmo> Oh boy
<Jmo> You've missed out :P
<Vivix> muds eh were the precursor to MMOs
<Gold_Demona> I was born in 84. Too young for text RPGs. :P
<Jmo> The Godfather of RPG
<Gold_Demona> Holy crap, something I'm too young for!
<Vivix> Hehe I was born in 1989 ;__; I played some

<Vivix> MIT is Massachussets institute of technology
<Gold_Demona> I was born in 1984
*Panda cant follow the convo
<Vivix> MUD is .. an engine for text adventure games for multiplep layers, basicly multiplayer rpg
<Gold_Demona> MIT is the school Gordon Freeman went to. :D
*Jmo hugs Panda
<Vivix> Indeed he diid

<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo> Moo.
<Gold_Demona> Moo
<Gold_Demona> Despite having not played the KingsQuest series, I do like point and clink games. :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> Moo.
<Vivix> I think best point and click I played was Broken Sword
<Gold_Demona> Most of them have a goofy sense of humor which I really enjoy. XD
<Gold_Demona> SpaceQuest was a good game series too. I only played through a couple of them though. Watched a Let's Play of the rest.
<Panda> Oi, I know... something attractive.
<Jmo> hm?
<Jmo> o.O
<Panda|Drawing> Jmo hm?
<Vivix> Flag that tail!
<Jmo> What do you mean attractive >.>
<Gold_Demona> O_o
<Panda|Drawing> Jmo, you know... curvy women and what not.
<Jmo> eh

<Jmo> Continue drawwing
<Panda|Drawing> Jmo, well.. what do you define as attractive?
<Jmo> Well
<Vivix> Sttuuuff

<Jmo> Ahahaha
<Vivix> I'm looking at Mudconnect, suddenly..want to play..muds with old guys..
<Malavolent> It hurts when IP.
<Vivix> hehe
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: why does it hurt when I pee?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Also I left with Lyra and I can't remember what happened.
<Jmo> You want to play with old men?
<Jmo> wat.

<Vivix> WE --MEED

<Vivix> We fucking need a pony mud!
*Vivix passes out in realization
<Barbetos|AtWork> I agree
<Jmo> Soapo
<Barbetos|AtWork> Why has this not happened yet?
<Vivix> Muds aren't even hard to make! You just need good writers and..a lot of room makers
<Vivix> hell, muds hardly had npc's as far as I remember-
<Barbetos|AtWork> I can write things!
*Vivix eats soap
*Jmo pokes Vivixs eye
<Vivix> Ah! Damnit
<Jmo> egghh
<Vivix> but oh a social--mud with adventures- why not
<Jmo> You haven't lived until you've died in MUD
*Vivix pokes Jmo's eye
<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo> I have no eyes.
<Jmo> What now.
*Vivix pokes your throat
<Vivix> brb darlings
<Gold_Demona> Remind me what MUD is?
<Jmo> Multi-user dungeon
<Vivix> multi user dungeon. eh
<Vivix> http://www.mudconnect.com/ some info here
<Vivix> wiki and muschlient has better info, kinda
<Vivix> brb
<Jmo> Such a nerd Vivix.
<Jmo> <3
<Gold_Demona> ah
*Jmo rolls around Dema
<Jmo> woopwoop
<Vivix> sudden visitor
<Barbetos|AtWork> SO. Pony mud?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yes?
<Jmo> o.o
<Vivix> yeah it is pretty nerdy- but wouldn't that be fun to hang out in? Hang out, be a pegasus, fight hydras
<Jmo> oh yeah for sure
<Vivix> It's basically IRC with a world and actions
<Barbetos|AtWork> Si senior.
<Jmo> lolsenior
<Barbetos|AtWork> =P
<Barbetos|AtWork> Everyone is a senior to el barbie
<Barbetos|AtWork> He is kind of slow
<Vivix> currenlty zero hits on pony in server list
<Vivix> Hehe
<Barbetos|AtWork> ^
<Vivix> but there's five harry potter servers
<Barbetos|AtWork> Excitement
<Barbetos|AtWork> Excite Pony Bike
<Barbetos|AtWork> =o
<Barbetos|AtWork> The ideas!
<Jmo> Demaa D:
<Gold_Demona> My power supply blinked. :<
<Jmo> :<
<Gold_Demona> It decided "No, I can't!" and turned both my computers off
<Jmo> Bad power supply.
<Gold_Demona> Need a new one. This one might be going bad. =/
<Vivix> Aww-
<Gold_Demona> If it's randomly blinking off for no reason
<Vivix> My last one went bad, fan broke and it started doing weird stuff-
<Gold_Demona> Oh, no it's not my computer power supply. Um... It's like a power strip but it's a battery?
<Jmo> Wonder why I was thinking UPS.
<Jmo> Oh
<Jmo> I was right
<Vivix> Ooh
<Vivix> Hehe
<Jmo> How about that. Ahaha
<Gold_Demona> Yesh Jmo. That's the word I was after. A UPS. :>
<Vivix> Never had one of those-
<Jmo> Was thinking how does one power supply shut down two computers, must be a UPS.
<Gold_Demona> lol yeah
<Jmo> I want one damn it, but they're abit hefty for decent ones.
<Vivix> Are they for surge protection and such?
<Barbetos|AtWork> What is your PSU rated at?
<Gold_Demona> Mine's been pretty good. Had it for a few years
<Barbetos|AtWork> bronze, silver, or gold?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or none of those things?
<Dken2021> morning folks
<Jmo> Betting on generic brand.
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: It's for surge protection and if the power shuts off, it has a battery that supplies enough power for you to safely shut your computer down.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I need to get a battery back up
<Barbetos|AtWork> =\
*Panda|Drawing licks Jmo
<Vivix> Ah nice, surges and outs are extremely rare where I live, never had one outside of specific situations- but- my current living room/studio is 10A, so sometimes my bass amp blows the fuses, then it would be nice to have one
<Gold_Demona> I think the battery in mine crapped out because it no longer keeps my computers on when the power blinks.
*Jmo pats Panda|Drawing
<Jmo> Time to replace Dema
<Gold_Demona> Yup
<Jmo> I mean the UPS, not Dema.
<Panda|Drawing> Whats a Dema/
<Gold_Demona> XD
<Jmo> <.<
<Gold_Demona> Use commas Moojay. :>
<Vivix> Dema is what makes Gold_Demona a Demona
<Jmo> HOW TO COMMA
<Gold_Demona> Panda|Drawing: Dema is a character in one of my comics. Jmo likes is lots. :>
<Jmo> ^
<Gold_Demona> So he calls me Dema
<Jmo> :>
<Gold_Demona> :>
<Panda|Drawing> Gold_Demona, you has comic?
<Gold_Demona> Yesh. A Nuzlocke comic.
<Jmo> http://golddemona.deviantart.com/gallery/29277669
<Jmo> Ish so good ;_;
<Gold_Demona> ;p;, You flatter me mojay. XD
<Colt_Brovakiin> Good afternoon :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Colt_Brovakiin
<Dken2021> Afternoon Colty
<Gold_Demona> I erased it and I STILL typed it wrong! It's "lol" not ";p;"
<Jmo> :P
<Gold_Demona> I don't even know what ;p; is. XP
<Gold_Demona> Livin the Suite life, Colt?
<Gold_Demona> Ah, was gonna say
<Colt_Brovakiin|Suit> It didn't all fit Gold_Demona :P
<Gold_Demona> :D
*Panda|Drawing licks Gold_Demona
<Panda|Drawing> I love it
<Gold_Demona> You do? =D
<Jmo> Like adam isn't bad enough.
<Gold_Demona> Getting licked ish worth it to get compliments. ^^
<Dken2021> it isn't ;_;
<Dken2021> ?
<Panda|Drawing> Gold_Demona, im a littlejelly though. you art so good
<Gold_Demona> My art is good, but there are many better than me. =/
<Vivix> Deviant is always the slowest page to load for me- no matter what the net
<Jmo> Dema ish best artest.
<Gold_Demona> I can't say my art is bad, but there's certainly better.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek is better than me
<Gold_Demona> His art is awesome
<Barbetos|AtWork> IF we make a mud we should create a bronystate theatre in the world that you can visit. :3
<Panda|Drawing> Gold_Demona look... dont compare yourself to others. you have talent..
<Barbetos|AtWork> Also you can get kicked out of by shizu
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> Yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> You woke the shizu. You are now banned from bronystate theater. Way to go. Moron.
<Vivix> I'm currently working on a paintchat replacement, not specificly for here but--you know, so I'm a little too distracted to start on a mud, but I'd love to see one
<Panda|Drawing> Gold_Demona, yes Wrek has awesome talent. But you do realize that you are pushing yourself back, right? :/
<Vivix> I can't remember what we used to make muds, or host them, but it's not nearly as hard as making legends of equestria, you just need good descriptions, fun writing, and good missions and adventures
*Jmo pushes Vivix back
<Gold_Demona> What do you mean Panda?
*Vivix falls
<Jmo> woop
<Vivix> And, we can compare ourself to others and realize they are better, without being sad or disappointed
<Panda|Drawing> Aye Vivix.
<Sylandest> Panda|Drawing: you should link that one image I showed you before, the one about art and whatnot
<Gold_Demona> I'm not sad about it. Just being humble.
<Vivix> Yeah, it's a healthy view as an artist
<Panda|Drawing> Sylandest XD Gold_Demona sounds like me, no?
<Vivix> convincing ourselves we are the best at what we do is worse
<Sylandest> Panda|Drawing: just a tad
<Gold_Demona> Of course I work to get better at my craft. That's how I got as good as I am to begin with. :P
<Panda|Drawing> Vivix, yup.
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<Vivix> Yeah, we strive, and striving is part of the fun
<Panda|Drawing> btw.... Gold_Demona, I love that ham ham OC <3
<Gold_Demona> As for my Nuzlocke comic, it's more of a side thing that I don't really put my full artistic effort into so I have something my art skill can do without getting frustrated.
<Gold_Demona> Thanks, Panda. ^^
<Panda|Drawing> And then I realized I was talking to a lady.
<Panda|Drawing> xD
<Jmo> ._.
<Gold_Demona> Bahaha XD
<Hoody|School> Ello state of the bronies
<Sylandest> howdy Hoody|School

<Sylandest> But I am tired
<Panda|Drawing> :3
<Vivix> I dunno what it is, I got really tired at 1pm, and I only got up at 6am
*Panda|Drawing doesnt sleep
<Hoody|School> My hamster woke me up
<Panda|Drawing> O_o
<Gold_Demona> Sleep is for Pansies
<Vivix> I didn't when I was a teen, maybe that's why I'm so sleepy now
<Panda|Drawing> hamster alarm sstem?
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Panda|Drawing> system*
<Gold_Demona> My cats wake me up. Frequently
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<Panda|Drawing> boredom wakes me up... but it also puts me to sleep
<Panda|Drawing> hm...
<Gold_Demona> Last night my father in-law woke me up by calling my phone when we were almost asleep. ?_?
<Panda|Drawing> XD
<Panda|Drawing> They tend to do that... at least they didnt call while "in the moment" nothing kills a mood like a virbrating phone XD
<Gold_Demona> LOL True. XD
<Hoody|Skool> Ugh, internet derp
<Gold_Demona> We tend to ignore the phones when that happens though. Not that it happens often
*Panda|Drawing shrugs
<Hoody|Skool> Wait what
<Hoody|Skool> The conversation went to sex while I was gone for 5 seconds?
<Panda|Drawing> I was on call at work, so I had to keep my phone on vibrate XD bad move.
<Gold_Demona> XD
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Dken2021> hm?
<Panda|Drawing> Whoops sorry Hoody|School, I was just cracking a joke.
<Gold_Demona> You married too, Panda? I'm beginning to think I'm the only married person in all of Bronystate. XP
<Jmo> LOL
<Gold_Demona> Everyone else is either single or underage. :P
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: no, but he does have a lovely lady he absolutely adores
<Panda|Drawing> Gold_Demona alas, I was almost married... but thats a story for another day. I am with someone though.
<Hoody|Skool> LMFAOOTFRALOL

<HoodyBear> How did I get here?
<Panda> Gold_Demona YES D: I want!!!!
<Barbetos|AtWork> I use http://www.ctrlpaint.com/ for my lessons
<Gold_Demona> My very first crochet project. :3
<Panda> how the hell did you do that though Demi? if I can call you that.
<HoodyBear> Barbetos|AtWork: I draw stuff with a pencil
<Barbetos|AtWork> Panda I am working towards being able to draw ponies cuase I want to starta tumblr, and work on the anima project for TTEoAP
<Panda> TTEaAP? whats that?
<Barbetos|AtWork> among other things
<Barbetos|AtWork> Through The Eyes of Another Pony
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its an awesome Fan Fic
<Barbetos|AtWork> So awesome in fact that it now has a team of people working on animating it
<Gold_Demona> Panda: Crochet. That's how. :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> They need story boarders and animators though
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wrek has done some art for the fic too
<HoodyBear> Isn't the story already written?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Written, but not complete
<Dken2021> did anyone manage to watch that fan episode "Dusk Dawn"?
<Panda> Gold_Demona oh gosh XD but i crochet, but nothing ever looks like that
<Barbetos|AtWork> He has about 15 chapters of 24 or something like that
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dken2021: no
<Barbetos|AtWork> I was not even aware of it
<Hoody|Skool> Fan episode?
<Hoody|Skool> Wut?
<Dken2021> well....don't, trust me
<Gold_Demona> Panda: It's mostly just plain singlestitch.
<Hoody|Skool> I wish I had artistic talent ;_;
<Panda> did you fill it with cotton Gold_Demona?
<Panda> Hoody|Skool EVERYONE CAN HAVE TALENT!
<Panda> :3
<Hoody|Skool> All I can do is dance
<Panda> Thats an artistic talent Hoody|Skool....
<Hoody|Skool> But I don't like to dance...
<Gold_Demona> Panda: I made the base sides as a base. Embroidered the pink lines into it. Then I made the edges and corners separately and sewed them on. The corners, circles, and hearts were made with the circle-type technique, and I sewed the hearts into the circles and sewed everything into place.
<Panda> Hoody|Skool well i can tell you now. talent is earned, not given.
<Gold_Demona> Panda: I filled the cube with polyfoam I cut into squares and sewed it shut. :)
<Gold_Demona> Panda: You are mistaking talent for skill
<Hoody|Skool> ^
<Gold_Demona> Talent you are born with. It's SKILL you earn
<Vivix> talent is an aptidue or learning ability
<Hoody|Skool> thats the technical term
<Panda> Gold_Demona.... I am jealous! and I always match them as one in the same. Just some are more predisposed to it...
<Vivix> and everyone can earn skill, talent or not- basically, but it takes will and desire
<Hoody|Skool> shit gotta go
<Hoody|Skool> latas
<Dken2021> seeya Hoody
<Gold_Demona> But they're not the same...
<Jmo> Weird kid >.>
<Vivix> Hehe
<Gold_Demona> You can have talent and no skill, and vice versa
<Barbetos|AtWork> Most people have a calling that they persue, and others are born to do what they do.
<Vivix> yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> pursue*
<Gold_Demona> You can learn a skill and still suck at it
<Vivix> I don't have a talent for art, but I've learned enouh to have fun
<Panda> Gold_Demona, hm... I see what you mean hun. My mistake ^^;
<Jmo> Yeah like Vivix knows how to make music but still sucks
<Jmo> <3
<Vivix> I know ;__;
<Gold_Demona> O Jmo

<Barbetos|AtWork> I should get war z.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah. I'ma get it
<BoroBrony> get dayz :)
<Jmo> LOL
<Vivix> DayZ is so buggy-
<Vivix> thanks to Arma
<Jmo> It is near unplayable
<Jmo> imo
<BoroBrony> well they are making it a standalone game at the end of this year
<Vivix> It does have moments where it's so wrong that it's--ridiculous
<Vivix> Isn't that WarZ?
<Jmo> Yeah that's the end of the year.
<Jmo> no
<Jmo> Two different games.
<Vivix> Ahkai
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh shit
<Barbetos|AtWork> The website is being blown the f up
<Vivix> Either way WarZ looks playable and not in that engine
<Jmo> lolwut?
<BoroBrony> dayZ is amazing if you can run it anyone here got a zombie plan
<Barbetos|AtWork> War Z uses the Cry egine I think
<Vivix> no, zombies don't exist
<Vivix> DayZ I could run even on my old, old computer
<BoroBrony> if they did lol
<Vivix> Well, even if, I'd have no plan
<Jmo> OH
<Jmo> IT'S YOU
<Jmo> ALIENWARE KID
<Jmo> HAHAHAHA
<BoroBrony> i am in the british army and i know they ahve a plan just in case
<Vivix> Well, I don't really care about that
<Jmo> ^
<Barbetos|AtWork> Either a lot of people are trying to get war z right now, OR the websit has been a victim of a DDoS
<Barbetos|AtWork> D:
<BoroBrony> whats war z like
<Vivix> Well it is 15th for the WarZ people soon- so it might be overloaded
<Jmo> Well Alpha release is soon.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh there we go

<Jmo> Scaring people, psshtt.
<Everlasting_Joy> I'd say "falcon punch" but that would have blown the whoel building to smitherines.
<Sylandest> Everlasting_Joy: I'll be fine, hehe. I'm just feeling blegh today. It happens around this time of night/day...or something
<Vivix> Or well, it would make me look authorative
<Vivix> or like an old fisherman

<Meanwhile> Lovely weather Wrek.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Guards waiting with guards
<GilDash> Better snow then rain...
<BronyInstrumental> than*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why are the guards just hunting them down?
<prince-dari> Because they have powers
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: theyre terrorists
<prince-dari> And are considered terrorists
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And do they have any evidence of said terrorism?
<twilight_sprinkle> hiro, dont hog the whole goddamn elevator
<prince-dari> Why would they need it?
<killerpony7733> Wrek Lucky!!!
<alexxm> so it's like x men in this time line then
<prince-dari> They oppose the current government
<prince-dari> And are therefore terrorists
<AJIsAwesome> Above you?
<twilight_sprinkle> hiro y u no freeze time
<Lyra|lunchbreak> doesnt that make them just discentors?
<prince-dari> WHAT A TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST

<BladedWings> eeyup
<prince-dari> The president is actually Sylar
<Sumica> 00,10superman
<prince-dari> Disguised as Nathan
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why would he need any other power than that?
<Meanwhile> lol
<AJIsAwesome> Sumerpan!
<Meanwhile> I must go, my planet needs me.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> prince-dari: why would he need a double disguise?
<alexxm> what a twist
*Jmo slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
<AJIsAwesome> :O
*AJIsAwesome hugs Jmo :3
<prince-dari> If they knew he were Sylar
<prince-dari> They'd all be after him
<Jmo> Some guy said to say hi to you when you wake up.
<Jmo> Can't remember who
<AJIsAwesome> WHAT A TWEEST

<prince-dari> YATTA!
<Meanwhile> Hey hold up if Sylar in the future now has access to Hiro's future corpse...
<AJIsAwesome> Chat is silent....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Whats with the comic?
<Meanwhile> The comic was drawn by the guy who paints the future.
<twilight_sprinkle> but maybe the future never happened
<Gold_Demona> Hiro is so adorable
<Meanwhile> The comic is basically part of his foretelling.
<twilight_sprinkle> agh time travel, it never makes any sense
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So its mobile plot
<oGriofa> Anyone up for minecraft?
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Bronysith
<BladedWings> hi Bronysith
<oGriofa> Hey Bronysith

<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Bronysith
<alexxm> how are things Bronysith
<ASoftFluffyThing> But....
<twilight_sprinkle> save the last 1, because ill miss it if you stream it now..
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I was playing around in Black 2 and I actually found a evee
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Nice.
<Gold_Demona> Is that a european thing? Where you call it "series" instead of "seasons"?
<BladedWings> nice SpadeMagnes[School]
<twilight_sprinkle> i have time for 1 more thankfully
<Meanwhile> Gold_Demona: Apparently.
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: Not really. You can have multiple seasons in a series.
<GilDash> Do we?
<Gold_Demona> I thought so.
<GilDash> I don't. :S
<Gold_Demona> Cuz there are 23 episodes in the first season of Heroes
<Jmo> Oh AJIsAwesome, it was Docto.
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Gold_Demona> Doctor Who? Where?
<Jmo> Nowhere :<
<Gold_Demona> Aww :<
<prince-dari> GilDash: Well some people pick up 'season' because they watch a lot of American shows
<Gold_Demona> I am disappoint
<prince-dari> But the UK English is to say 'series'
<Gold_Demona> I getcha
<Meanwhile> You mean the correct English.
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: Well, yeah.
<twilight_sprinkle> they say "season" in russian too
*Gold_Demona sings "THE MORE YOU KNOW!!~~~
<GilDash> prince-dari: Obviously I need some Queen's English Remedial lessons. XD
<prince-dari> Hah
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gold_Demona: ding!
<Gold_Demona> I speak wrong English. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> there is no right or wrong english.
<prince-dari> Well, there is.
<GilDash> Gold_Demona: I speak Yorkshish, so I've no hope to start with. :D
<Wrek> 05i speak gibberish
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So adorkable
<Wrek> 05i mean english
<prince-dari> i am want good do
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aww
<prince-dari> Would be wrong English.
<Meanwhile> I bet New York is totally reassured by that.
<Gold_Demona> I love Hiro
<Meanwhile> "Yeah thanks random asian man, I feel much safer."
<GilDash> prince-dari: No, that's goobledegook.
<Meanwhile> You mean gobbledegook.
<Gold_Demona> dat gobbledegook
<GilDash> Oh, pish posh. Leave me alone. :D

<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: :D
<prince-dari> And now Sylar knows the future too.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I was going to wait for the right time to share this one, but is it too good to wait for it. http://i.imgur.com/chnxJ.gif
<twilight_sprinkle> kinda dead here, bro
<GilDash> You know, if you hadn't killed him Sylar I'm sure he would tell you.
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: That's amazing. :D
<Meanwhile> Sylar is a monumental moron.
<GilDash> Barbetos|AtWork: That's frickin' hilarious. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> In other news, I can not watch Football, I have to play it
<Barbetos|AtWork> OTherwise I get bored.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh i remember that nba game
<twilight_sprinkle> i remember absing the out glitch all the time

<AJIsAwesome> So she has a split personality?
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, nvm.

<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: but this isnt her
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Ok, just making sure.

<AJIsAwesome> You want what I have.......the Krabby Patty formula.
<Meanwhile> Plankton.
<prince-dari> I wonder if anyone will notice
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: ill be visiting you tonight
<Meanwhile> That this is the kid who Parkman found?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: ........
<prince-dari> Yep.
<prince-dari> But will anyone notice something else.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dabi, I still don't know why kids love cinnamon toast crunch so much
<Meanwhile> Is it too late to notice what we were trying to notice?
<Meanwhile> Because I didn't notice.
<prince-dari> Well if no one has noticed by now, they're not likely too.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh. I see it. Its a stream on bronystate right?
<Meanwhile> What was it?
<twilight_sprinkle> i only saw some pics on a monitor
<prince-dari> Can't tell you
<prince-dari> Spoilers.
<Meanwhile> Damnit.
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought it looked like the transforming girl
<twilight_sprinkle> but i coldnt tell who else was on it
<prince-dari> Sylar has super hearing
<prince-dari> Lul
<twilight_sprinkle> heres JOHNNY
<Queen_Chrysalis> what we watchin?
<twilight_sprinkle> Heroes
<Kurra> Whoa it's Spock!
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<Gold_Demona> He was Sylar before he was Spock :D
<twilight_sprinkle> why didnt htey kill him
<Kurra> Also why is Spock wearing a helmet?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Spock.
<twilight_sprinkle> he shouldve just killed him
<alexxm> so spock was superpowered serial killer before he joined starfleet
<twilight_sprinkle> although i guess if he turns out immortal that coul screw them up
<twilight_sprinkle> i forget if hes already immortal
<twilight_sprinkle> oh wait nvm
<Meanwhile> He's...I'm not sure, he can regenerate to a degree but he can't be invulnerable yet.
<twilight_sprinkle> yes he isnt invulnerable yet because he only got claire in the future

<AJIsAwesome> Dat realization
<Meanwhile> The Walker System.

<TheMonstaMuffin> GriffonCherry|Maid: Sure :)
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i think its because he looks at their brain or examines their bodies in some way
<Meanwhile> Np.
<alexxm> senteced to death by snowglobe
<Dark_Horst> means he can learn powers ´by taking their owner's brains apart
<twilight_sprinkle> its odd he looks at a dead brain though, id think he would need analyza the dna or a working brain, but eh
<Gold_Demona> Saresh got a gold star. :D
<Meanwhile> I'm sure it's going to be a cheery conversation when Parkman and Ted find her.

<prince-dari> >oh well, he deserves another chance
<twilight_sprinkle> Gold_Demona: ps2 seems to be a heavy game though
<Gold_Demona> True
<Gold_Demona> Sylar wants his mommy. :<

<prince-dari> DAYUUUUMMMMMMM
<Meanwhile> Woah...that's harsh.

<Meanwhile> Nice going.

<prince-dari> Should have stepped in earlier
<alexxm> well shes ded
<ASoftFluffyThing> Decapitation?
<Meanwhile> Oh dear.
<twilight_sprinkle> tough day for sylar
<AJIsAwesome> So he basically enters another state of mind?
<AJIsAwesome> When he uses his powers?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: no hes always this way
<Meanwhile> Well if he wasn't totally gone in the head beforehand he definitely is now.
<prince-dari> Ouch
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Oh, okay.
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks.
<prince-dari> So his dad hated him because he was born too late
<prince-dari> Well, maybe not hated him
<prince-dari> But he was cold.
<twilight_sprinkle> hiro really shouldve hurried up with the kil
<Meanwhile> That's real nice.
<Gold_Demona> WOw. Clean break

<Gold_Demona> A ROCK?!
<Chrysalis> Hai Guys!
<Jmo> Hayo
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Chrysalis. :)
<alexxm> how are things Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> How are people this evening
<AJIsAwesome> Pretty good.
<Chrysalis> alexxm been better, public transport is abysmal
<Chrysalis> i left work 2 hours ago
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> oh good, heros
<Meanwhile> These people have way too many hang-ups about stopping the huge explosion.
<prince-dari> Evil bitch
<prince-dari> Wants the huge explosion to happen
<Meanwhile> I don' wanna kill Sylar it's against Bushido.
<Gold_Demona> What's her power? I don't remember if they ever showed it
<Meanwhile> I don' wanna shoot you you're my uncle.
<prince-dari> She dreams the future
<twilight_sprinkle> shits getting messy
<twilight_sprinkle> ..that came out wrong
<prince-dari> I DO BELIEVE!
<Meanwhile> So they want to have the bomb go off and kill millions so...they can have a puppet president?
<BladedWings> can you be batman!
<prince-dari> Something like that Meanwhile
<prince-dari> Lawl
<twilight_sprinkle> this show is full of moms of the year
<Meanwhile> Is that seriously all they want?
<prince-dari> He drew a picture in her blood.
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: I'm not entirely sure to be honest
<BladedWings> dude thats creepy
<alexxm> well he's broken
<prince-dari> >implying he wasn't alread
<Gold_Demona> They said I could be anything I want, so I became a bomb.
<prince-dari> already*
<Meanwhile> I hope that's not all because that is terribly unbelievable motivation.
<twilight_sprinkle> why not, they could control the country
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the cheerleader character is the most pointless to me in this show
<Meanwhile> They have enough power and connections to do that through bribery anyway.
<prince-dari> I think they might be anticipating an apocalypse of sorts due to people with powers
<prince-dari> So they are trying to take over to control it
<prince-dari> Or something like that
<prince-dari> I don't really remember.
<twilight_sprinkle> dont think bribery would help that much, they dont seem to be excessively rich
<Meanwhile> Oh this was a good idea.
<twilight_sprinkle> their security sucks
<twilight_sprinkle> wow gg
<Meanwhile> Oh god damnit.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh shit, he's heating up
<Meanwhile> And then everypony came.

<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a57b29c78c90d2dd174dd9e426677467.png HAHAHAHAHA ALL THOSE WHO DISLIKE PINKIE ARE FUCKED :D
<Joomay> Needs less caps and needs more soap.
<Pondoo> hm.... MadSurge atryl is an awesome artist :3
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Dken2021> MadSurge and then she puts on the mask and nothing happens
<Joomay> caps, reminds me of FO
<Bunny_Striker> so... this wat happens when I`m gone?
<MadSurge> Dken2021: she just gets slightly more powerful :D
<Dken2021> i DUNNO
*Bunny_Striker goes back to hidy hole
<Dken2021> yay caplocks :/
<Chrysalis> Pinkie + mask?
<Chrysalis> thats a scary thought
<Chrysalis> shed have...
<Chrysalis> GREEN HAIR
<AJIsAwesome> Was that Golden Harvest or Carrot Top that said "Well, I never"?
*Joomay slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
<Joomay> i dno u tel me
<Joomay> ayejay
<AJIsAwesome> I hear it's Carrot Top, but some people say it's Golden Harvest.
<Dken2021> either or
<Dken2021> tomato, tomato
<Joomay> >_>
<Joomay> Genius.
<Vivix> Golden Harvest is the official name for Carrot Top, so it's Golden 'Carrot Top' Harvest
<Joomay> Liar.
<Vivix> Wikia saaid sooo
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Okay. Thanks. :)
<TheMonstaMuffin> Johnny nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Joomay> You believe everything on wikia?
<Dken2021> does that mean that derpy can be ditzy doo as well?
<AJIsAwesome> Not sure.
<Vivix> Noo ;__; but I'm a big Carrot Top fan for some reason
<Joomay> Psht
<Vivix> depends, if you want to, you can bend any canon as long as there's no constricting evidence
<Kandarihu> Now it's just sad to keep watching this game on the stream knowing that I can't play it.
<Joomay> Play it on a toaster.
<Joomay> oi DWR
<Kandarihu> Joomay, my GPU is a few models below the minimum requirements. And its crashing on an error message saying that it can't find my GPU
<Joomay> ATI or Nvidia
<TheMonstaMuffin> Anone wanna pizza pie?
<alexxm> meme denied
<Kandarihu> Joomay, ATI
<Kurra> fffff
<Joomay> Model number
<Kandarihu> TEAM SPECTATE!
<Joomay> Well, series I should say.
<Kandarihu> 4250
<Joomay> Ahahaha
<Joomay> You poor bloke.
<Joomay> Running AMD CPU I'm guessing?
<Vivix> What are you trying to play?
<Kandarihu> Joomay, eeyup
<Joomay> PS2
*Joomay hugs Kandarihu
<Vivix> PS2 EM?
<Joomay> There there.
<Joomay> Planetside 2 you dummy >.>
<Vivix> Ooh
<Vivix> <,<
*Joomay slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Joomay> You deserve that one.
<Vivix> :3
<DashWithRainbows> Wut u want Joomay?
<Vivix> Well, yes
<Kandarihu> Well, being able to run a Playstation 2 EMU on it would be great too.
<Joomay> You cleaned your room yet?
<DashWithRainbows> Most of it.
<Joomay> Egh, slacker.
<DashWithRainbows> My brother hasn't turned up in the past 2 days
<DashWithRainbows> So no point until he actually does.
<killerpony7733> Well for anyone who wants i got a free beta key still so if you want it and am sure you can run the game i'll give it
<Joomay> I don't blame him. Who'd wanna live with you. :>
<DashWithRainbows> All there is to do is move some stuff on the bed and I need to vacuum.
<DashWithRainbows> And oi.
<DashWithRainbows> I'm a good roomie
<Wrek> 05Joomay: behave
<Joomay> Ahahahahaha
<Chrysalis> Kandarihu you can if you have enough grunt
<Joomay> Love you too chav.
<DashWithRainbows> just don't use/take my stuff and all will be good
<Joomay> :3
<DashWithRainbows> <3
<Chrysalis> ohai Wrek
<Joomay> I wonder how'd a Aussie/British roomie scenario roll
<DashWithRainbows> Easy
<DashWithRainbows> Tea and Fosters everywhere
<Vivix> Eggs in a crisp bag and shrimp everywhere
<Joomay> Rofl
<Kandarihu> Chrysalis, I KNOW grunt. I'm perfectly used to framerates of 15 for anything I play. This isn't a matter of this game looking less pretty than what Wrek's awesome rig gets. THis is a matter of the game being being below Minimum.
<Joomay> I'll bring my spiders with me. K?
<Kandarihu> ...and because of that, it doesn't start
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/AmYY7.png "I'm meeeltiiiiing"
<Vivix> Yeah, when below minimum, only option is to respec
<Vivix> with todays computers though, that is often not too heavy on the wallet, thanks to consoles
<Joomay> Lul
<Dken2021> so I've just met some nice jehovah witnesses, they announced that they were jehovah witnesses before I opened the door, what nice people
<Joomay> Depends on what you want
<Vivix> Jmo! Steam broke
<Joomay> I'm still on
<Vivix> True, but if you just want to run it, it's not too expensive
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: :D
<Kandarihu> Vivix, I can't upgrade the GPU on this computer, because it's a laptop.
<Vivix> Ooh, I forget laptops exist fairly often-
<Joomay> Rofl laptop
<Joomay> First mistake right there >.>
<Vivix> despite having one
<Dken2021> hehe
<Vivix> Pretty much- even gaming laptops aren't very good for gaming- you'd save money by buying a medium/av stationary
<Joomay> Oi DWR, can I be your roomie?
<DashWithRainbows> lolno
<DashWithRainbows> Single bed
<Joomay> awwww
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<DashWithRainbows> Actually
<DashWithRainbows> yes.
<DashWithRainbows> >:3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02My laptop is pretty powerful D:
<Joomay> wut..?
<DashWithRainbows> NewSuperBronyU needs nerf
<Joomay> What the hell are you planning
<MadSurge> Dat NewSuperBronyU :3
<DashWithRainbows> Nothing~
<Vivix> Power laptops exist, but it's cheaper to buy a stationary, in the long run at least
<Joomay> Bollocks, you are planning.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I think an Intel Core i7 and GeForce 660 M GTX is perfect enough for gaming :D
<DashWithRainbows> Needs nerf
<DashWithRainbows> pronto
<Joomay> That would of been a nasty price tag
<Chrysalis> SB64 'M' model?
<Chrysalis> need more power
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Price tag for it was $1200
<Joomay> SSD?
<Vivix> I've got i7 2600 670GTX 16gb ram on around..1200 dollars spread out over one and a half year
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02HDD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,021 TB though :D
<Joomay> 6/8GB RAM?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,028 GB
<Vivix> 1tb here too
<Joomay> How big is the screen
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,0215.4" 1080p
<oGriofa> Oh gosh i suck at drawing on the computer..
<Joomay> egh 15.4"
<Joomay> Would drive me nuts
<Joomay> What brand?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lenovo
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02IdeaPad
<GilDash> I really need to build a new PC...
<Vivix> hm- never heard of, but sounds good
<Joomay> That ain't bad for that price tag
<GilDash> Lenovo... Chinese, I think.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ikr
<Vivix> China = good now adays
<Vivix> depending on the tier
<Joomay> compared to THAT brand in the corner.
<Chrysalis> SB64 needs more desktop less laptop
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Plus it has a Blu-Ray Burner and Reader :3
<Maid_RainBow> i have a Qaude core 4gb and GTS450 Nvidea 2 gb and 1tb hdd
<Joomay> ^
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Agreed.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I don't like desktop computer really...
<Joomay> y? :<
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: get into planetside2 naaaaaaow
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02computers*
<Joomay> They're fun to play with.
<Vivix> I prefer them since I don't have to upgrade very often
<GilDash> Next PC I'm getting is a desktop.
<DashWithRainbows> NewSuperBronyU You like to be on the move?
<Chrysalis> Bronysith people on?
<Vivix> I upgrade about once every 5 years or somethiing
<Joomay> Expecially when you overclock them and install liquid cooling. TEEHEE
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: me Wrek Sumica and others yes
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They're fun to build, but I'd rather have peace of mind by buying a computer built together already.
<AJIsAwesome> I really need to upgrade my harddrive. :D
<Joomay> Slacker >.>
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<Vivix> I like having things not prebuilt, since if something breaks I can replace it on my own for less money
<DashWithRainbows> But NewSuperBronyU, building computers is fun
<Chrysalis> Bronysith coming on now and gettin skype going
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: okay are you ikn the planetside 2 voice group?
<GilDash> Would you have more piece of mind by building it yourself and knowing how it's been set up?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Indeed, but after spending $1000+ on one and then getting issues, having to troubleshoot where the problem lies and then having to possibly replace a specific part isn't much fun.
<Joomay> Pfft
<Joomay> That is fun, whatchu on abuot.
<Joomay> about*
<Chrysalis> whoah wtf
<Vivix> Hehe
<alexxm> damn this map looks big
<Chrysalis> 5 missed calls on skype?
<Chrysalis> people really wanted to talk to me on the 5th
<Vivix> I burnt out my northbridge or something on my previous computer, never fouond out quite what was wrong
<DashWithRainbows> Chrysalis It's a weird glitch.
*ASoftFluffyThing plans on building a computer in the next one to three years
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Besides Consoles are better than PCs for gaming :P
<Vivix> but starting that computer was like reving a car, restart until it started
<Vivix> Pushh
<Joomay> Oh god
<oGriofa> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/289/9/4/oc__by_cretorf-d5i0350.png
<DashWithRainbows> Says that you missed calls from users even though they never done them
<Vivix> Consoles are too--old
<DashWithRainbows> ^
*Dken2021 wants to also make a gaming PC on his own
<Joomay> Just
<Joomay> That lowered my IQ reading that ;_;
<Vivix> I also save money on not having consoles, since I don't play that much-
<oGriofa> its bad but its the first thing ive tried to draw on my computer, any tips, btw not finished
<DashWithRainbows> Games on console are slacking. I'm sure NewSuperBronyU keeps his Nintendo products for exclusives, just like I do for my xbox
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If you want a few more shadows in your games go with PC, otherwise, I'll stick with consoles :)
<AJIsAwesome> oGriofa: It's nice. I like it. :)
<GilDash> Did he actually just say consoles... nah, I'm just hallucinating. XD
<Joomay> <_<
<Vivix> It's not that- I just don't like gamepads
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You need gamepads for certain games.
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<Vivix> Yeah, but the only one in mylibrary is GTASA
<oGriofa> AJIsAwesome: I tried to keep the style i use when i draw on paper. i use ink pen.
<Vivix> and I don't play that anymore
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Super Meat Boy is one of them >>
<DashWithRainbows> Or if you're just used to controllers, you can just hook it up to the PC
<Chrysalis> how i feel today
<Vivix> I don't like those kinda games either- so for me PC is only way, since I don't play that much, and prefer keyboard-
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/8/30/_qQwC0edxUSqzYpg_eJRNA2.jpg
<GilDash> PC's *can* fit controllers, you know?
<Joomay> Wat is USB
<GilDash> Even joysticks, if they're used nowadays.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02HOWEVER, I do enjoy what my laptop can do for playing games and possibly even getting a game that's significantly cheaper on PC than the console version.
<oGriofa> AJIsAwesome: Im going to start drawing on comptuer, so heres my deviant art http://cretorf.deviantart.com/art/OC-332568036?ga_submit=10%3A1350327745
<Joomay> Egh
<Joomay> PC is master race. Nothing will change that
<Vivix> For me, pc is best, for my uses
<Cameh_Dude> hello
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If there's one game I can't deny at all being better on PC than Consoles is Minecraft.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hey Cameh_Dude :)
<Vivix> modular, workstation, with games on the side
<Dken2021> I've always used consoles, but I'm waning towards PCs now
<AJIsAwesome> oGriofa: What program did you use?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Joomay: For certain things, not always.
<Joomay> Psht
<Cameh_Dude> whats the server name?
<Joomay> What's something consoles can do better?
<Meanwhile> Frat boys.
<oGriofa> AJIsAwesoome: Corel Sketch Pad, its the only thing that works right now because i dont have a tablet, i may buy one soon
<Joomay> Not gonna stab you, just curious.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If you like PCs better than Consoles, that's one thing, but there really is no 'pure' choice of gaming hardware. They all play differently, have different games and community features.
<Vivix> No tablet? Pretty nice oGriofa
<Joomay> I'm netural for both.
<oGriofa> Vivix: Im using my finger now, my comp is touch screen
<Vivix> Aah
<AJIsAwesome> oGriofa: Okay. I'm considering becoming an artist, but only when I have enough time and the right tools.
<DashWithRainbows> Pen and paper
<DashWithRainbows> easy to acquire
<Joomay> Still, I'd like to see things that console are more superior in.
<Vivix> Pencil and paper is the best starting point you could ever have
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Joomay: First, Nintendo makes consoles better. They don't develop on anything else. Second, the different controls are more innovative on consoles (i.e. Wii U GamePad, Xbox Kinect, PlayStation Move).
<Vivix> just look at ecmajor *fanboygasm*
<oGriofa> AJIsAwesome: When i get my tablet i might just keep using corel sketch pad, i like the styles i can use, but i cant find opaque colors :P
<Joomay> How is Nintendo making consoles superior to computers o.o
<AJIsAwesome> Okay. Thanks, DashWithRainbows and Vivix. :)
<Meanwhile> Nintendo is evil.
<AnFo> wat
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Because Nintendo makes some of the best games in the industry.
<Joomay> The controls, easily ported to computer.
<Meanwhile> I'm obligated to mention that whenever they come up so you know, just carry on.
<Joomay> Gaming industry?
<Vivix> While innovative controls are fun, I don't like innovation like kinect, move, or mirror game, or holograms-
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You can hack your way around it, but it's never as plug and play as a console.
<Joomay> Still, able to be done.
<DashWithRainbows> Hey, NewSuperBronyU, what would you say if I snapped the top half of my DS on purpose?
<Vivix> Another thing is that we can't say best games in the industry, when the diversity is subjective
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Probably the one thing I hate about PCs is certain games don't include matchmaking online. They just give you a list of servers to select from with their own special rules and not all of them have players in it.
<Dken2021> :O
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02DashWithRainbows: I don't care...?
<DashWithRainbows> Good boy :3
*NewSuperBronyU licks DashWithRainbows
<DashWithRainbows> eewwwww
<Joomay> Only cause that's how the developers made it.
<Vivix> I prefer browser list over matchmaking, but that's again just a preference-
<DashWithRainbows> Positive emotions
<DashWithRainbows> yuck
<Joomay> And how they see it fit the platform
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Joomay: It's how they made it specifically for PC, on consoles, you get matchmaking.
<Vivix> Then again, I usually prefer SP over MP
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I can easily jump in a game and start playing online.
<Vivix> on the same game?
<Joomay> Eh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yes
<Vivix> I've never tried a nintendo port on pc-
<Joomay> So you rather jump into a game at random instead of specific?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yes
<Joomay> Aight, that's your preference.
<Vivix> I prefer specific- lets me just--have one place to relate to
<Vivix> the dedicated server match thing in Valve games are kinda nice, no need to set up listenserver
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'd rather jump into a game that I know the rules automatically no matter what game I join instead of jumping in in a list of servers only to find out that a server is about 'Crouching Only' or 'Sniper Only'.
<DashWithRainbows> ^^^
<Vivix> ah those things, but I avoid those with tags
<Kandarihu> NewSuperBronyU, a game where every server goes by the same rules is fine for matchmaking. But bring in the factor of people wanting to play with their friends or servers with wierd modifications, and you're going to want to be more choosey with your servers.
<AnFo> You can find 'vanilla' servers that are hosted using a dedicated server.
<Joomay> ^
<Meanwhile> The answer would apparently be to...read the server rules before joining it?
<Joomay> ^
<prince-dari> Oh great, PC master race argument again?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Meanwhile: Sometimes they aren't clear until you join and get kicked.
<Joomay> Sue me dabi.
<Joomay> <.<
<Joomay> Not really an arguement
*NewSuperBronyU sues Joomay
<Meanwhile> True, but that's a poorly run server you don't want to be on anyway.
<AnFo> Just discussion.
<Joomay> Just curious.
*Dken2021 is lost
<Vivix> You kinda get that one server you like
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yeah, consoles will always be better than PCs imo :)
<Vivix> and always go to-
<Meanwhile> Plus there's usually a quick join function anyway.
<oGriofa> Ive been using alot of guides on paper, should i do the same with comp?
<oGriofa> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D-VxzMw4kv0/TeX7AX3TE2I/AAAAAAAAFTA/rHu8S-G-bf8/s1600/130255146209.png
<Vivix> guides?
<Vivix> try studies instead
<Joomay> Lulz
<Joomay> Whatever floats your boat SB
<alexxm> so who would win in a fight jet li or jackie chan
<Vivix> watch a characters movements and get familiar with how they're constructed
<AnFo> Jet Li.
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: Yes. :3
<Dken2021> oGriofa whichever one makes you feel comfortable doing
<Meanwhile> At this point in time, probably Li.
<Kandarihu> Half Minute Hero uses matchmaking. It limits the options you can choose unless you're the one starting the game.
<Meanwhile> Chan's robust and smart but he's not exactly spritely.
<Dken2021> Jackie chan is indeed good, but did he ever do a commercial for a phone?
<oGriofa> Dken2021: YEa i figured that, its just drawing on comp is so different.
<Vivix> it should feel the same, so I suggest a good tablet
<prince-dari> Jet Li is 49, Jackie Chan is 58
<prince-dari> Not much contest there.
<Joomay> dabi pls
<Xaiden> who's streming? and what?
<Xaiden> *streaming
<alexxm> chuck norris is in his 70's last i checked
<prince-dari> jaymoo pls
<Kandarihu> Xaiden, not sure who's streaming, but this is Planetside 2
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek, and Planetside 2.
<Xaiden> Live commentary?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Xaiden> cool
<Kandarihu> I wonder if Wrek would be interested in playing and streaming Phantasy Star Online 2 when it comes out in English.
<Kandarihu> BNY?
<Xaiden> Hey just a quick question then I got to fly: What's the software used to livestream, is it mips.tv?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Kandarihu> Is it limited to 3 letters?
<Dken2021> mips is the stream provider, there's a separate software involved
<Joomay> Some Adobe program
<Dken2021> yea that
<Xaiden> Hm
<Wrek> 05yeah
<Joomay> Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder
<Joomay> I think?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Speaking of consoles, the Wii drops in price to $130 effective October 28th :D
<Vivix> Moooneey
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: What was its orginal price when it first came out?
<Dken2021> yay, too bad I won't be able to afford it yet
<Xaiden> NewSuperBronyU: Who said anything about consoles?
<Vivix> We talked about it earlier
<Dken2021> or use that internet connection
<Xaiden> oh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02AJIsAwesome: $599 US Dollars
<Kandarihu> Xaiden, we were talking about consoles before you came.
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Oh you! :P
<Meanwhile> Yay, too bad you could invest $130 in ice cream and come away with more enjoyment.
<Kandarihu> PC vs Consoles
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It was actually $250 :)
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Joomay> ROFL
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks. :)
<Xaiden> Hey anyone getting Dead Space 3 or Black Ops 2 for the PS3?
<Xaiden> since were talking 'bout consoles
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They announced Dead Space 3 already? o.o
<Joomay> >_>
<Dken2021> wha? so it's gonna be cheaper than the wii launch price?
<Joomay> Months ago.
<Maid_RainBow> Dead Space 3?
<Meanwhile> Mm, and they gave it co-op.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm getting Black Ops II on Wii U ^-^
<alexxm> why are there 3 dead spaces
<Xaiden> NewSuperBronyU: Dude, like 3 trailers have came
<Meanwhile> Because they're done pretending that they're trying to make a horror franchise.
<Vivix> I thouht Dead Space 3 was out
<Joomay> ^
<Joomay> oh my Vivix.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Not a fan of Dead Space so I don't know >>
*Vivix didn't want to play it
<Xaiden> Well no they haven't given up, watch the Eudora walkthrough on their channel
<Joomay> It isn't out till next year
<Vivix> Ah
<Xaiden> Joomay: Wasn't it said to come out in Nov, earlier this year?
<Vivix> The only thing I remember abou DeadSpace, other than the LP I'm watching, is pregnant fluttershy deadspace thing
<Joomay> No
<Meanwhile> And Black Ops 2 will presumably be the same as Black Ops 1. Which was the same as the one before that which was the same as the one before that...repeat ad infinitum.
<Joomay> February 2013
<Saturn> 08,01wheeee
<Joomay> Was announced in June
<AJIsAwesome> Having fun, Saturn? :P
<Xaiden> But still, anyone getting DS3 for the PS3? Looking for co-op partners,
<Saturn> 08,01no
<Vivix> O u
<Saturn> 08,01i'm trying to figure out if it's possible for a person to do a sonic rainboom
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I already have a 3DS :)
<Joomay> How did 3DS come into play o.o
<Xaiden> NewSuperBronyU: D: Dead S: Space, 3
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Do you have Kid Icarus: Uprising? :)
<Vivix> Smileys make me feel uneasy ;__;
<Xaiden> It was an anagram
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02AJIsAwesome: Yesh :3
<Xaiden> -_-
<AJIsAwesome> YAY!
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: I have it too. :3
<Meanwhile> What does the 3DS have to do with anything?
<Joomay> ^^^^^
<Dken2021> itsajoke.jpg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I also had Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3D Land and a bunch of other games that I had in my game pouch which I lost ;~;

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Meanwhile: so srs

<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Ok.
<Eli> Lil_B pff customised greeting
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dken2021, I think it was false movie titles and something else relating to the lottery. Don't remember all of it.

<Meanwhile> Hm, well, waiting to hear all of it.

<Vivix> Eever?
<Meanwhile> How do you manage to never have curry?
<Eli> Dken2021: you missed about 45% of life then
<Eli> life is curry
<Dken2021> dunno, never seems to come up
<AnFo> Try it once in yo life.
<Jmo> No life is pie.
<AnFo> Curry pie.

<Eli> Jmo: curry pie and we call it a deal?
<AnFo> ^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A npc in pandaria is Lun-chi, a blatant reference if I ever saw one
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't say that it's just like...living in the western hemisphere and never having a chinese takeout.
<Jmo> Na, terrible idea.
<Jmo> Chocolate pie is better.
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] does that npc have some child bearing hips?
<Meanwhile> I mean has anyone here never had a chinese takeaway?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> her title is ,the street fighter.
<Eli> Jmo: i'm not much of a sweet tooth. i prefer curry

<Jmo> Wasn't relating the two.
<Meanwhile> Originally yes curry is Indian, but most forms of it in the west have almost nothing in common with the original recipes.
<Vivix> Curry is a dish, but also a spice
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A quest i found was called, Bros befor hozen
<Vivix> well spice mix I think?
<Jmo> Currymuncha. Wee
<AnFo> It is spice mix
<Vivix> ChimmiCurryChungaCherri
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: they have many weird refrences if you go look for it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I found a page that was interesting
<GilDash> Chinese curry isn't proper curry... there's something off about it. :S
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: like "Magnets. how do they work?"
<Jmo> Chinese curry? wut.
<Jmo> How does that work
<Vivix> Never had chinese curry-
<Vash> Eli magic
<SpadeMagnes[School]> it had a bunch of numbers, turns out its a reference to D3's release date
<Dken2021> interesting, well I might try it when the chance comes
<Eli> Vash: it's a miracle
<Vash> Eli electron spins of atoms all aligned in a particular direction
<GilDash> Vivix: Give it a miss. It's very... meh.
<Jmo> Geeeeeek
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I do like some npcs progressivly get annoyed the more you click them
<Vivix> huh, who'da thoguht promiscuous is a definition used in animal psychology
<Vivix> GilDash, aww..akai
<Eli> Vash: tell that to ICP
<Vash> jmo i am a physics major
<Vash> Eli yeah i got the ref
<Jmo> Want a medal?
<Vash> yes
<Vash> and a cooklie
<Jmo> Ain't getting one.
<GilDash> Vivix: Go for a nice dopiaza. Indian curries are the best. ^_^
*Eli hands Vash a medal and a cooky
<Vash> yay
<Eli> cookie*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also fuck Armsmaster Harlan
<MadSurge> GilDash! :)
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He is a terrible boss fight
<Meanwhile> Have you ever been to India GilDash?
<Jmo> Ahahaha
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Nope.
<Jmo> Major boi gone.
<Meanwhile> Then chances are you have no idea what Indian curry tastes like.
<MadSurge> GilDash: to be honest I hate chinese. I can't stand anything with mixed flavours :S
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Probably not, but I'd love to try it.
<GilDash> MadSurge: Funny, Chinsese is one of my least favourite take aways.
<Meanwhile> GilDash: If you ever go, don't argue with the police, and don't hand out change to homeless kids.
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Eli> Meanwhile: i have never been to india, but i know what real indian curry tastes like. it's called indian friends
<Jmo> LOl
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know why Armsmaster Harlan is terrible? He has a attack that can pick you up and it goes on for awhile and you get damaged through the entire thing!
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I'm not a *complete* idiot, even if I am Yorkish. Next you'll be telling me not to harp on about immigration... XD
<Jmo> Ahaa Yorkish.
<MadSurge> GilDash: then again, I;m very picky :D
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Oh and don't flip anyone off, they hate that.
<Jmo> But that's the fun part.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Isn't that common to everyone, everywhere?
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Yes.
<Jmo> Only those who take things seriously.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Then it hardly needs saying, doesn't it? :p
<Jmo> :?
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: *:/ :P
<Meanwhile> GilDash: No but I thought since you lack common sense I should make even the obvious clear. :3
<Jmo> No don't you edit me.
<Jmo> I meant that.
<AJIsAwesome> Yes
<AJIsAwesome> :3
<GilDash> Jmo: True. I occasionally greet my friends with, "Oi! You cunts!" XD
<Jmo> :P
<Meanwhile> I refer to my sister as "Jihaad"
<Meanwhile> That doesn't blow over that well in public.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gee I wonder why
<Jmo> The butthurt is all around.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Well, thank you. I shall jot your advice down in my "Top 10: India" book. XD
<Vivix> I don't know anyone with a knickname
<alexxm> whos butthurt Jmo
<Eli> I call my little brother "gaylord" nothing about it
<Saturn> 08,01ah, India
<Meanwhile> Especially not when I'm trying to find her.
<Jmo> Yo mamma. Shizzam.
<Meanwhile> Strolling through shop aisles. "Oi, Jihaad!"
<Saturn> 08,01i can tell you some great things not to do/say there
<Vivix> Don't resque naked girls
<alexxm> like what Saturn
<Vivix> That I remember
<Jmo> Hey Saturn, what would happen if you called someone a curry muncher there?
<Jmo> Just curious.
<Jmo> No racism intended.
<Meanwhile> Don't burst into song and dance, they only do that in movies.
<Dken2021> Saturn like star in a bollywood film?
<Saturn> 08,011. don't yell "DENGU" instead of "YAHTZEE" when in Andrah Pradesh
<alexxm> how come
<Saturn> 08,01Dken2021: yeah, try not to get caught up in a bollywood film
<Saturn> 08,01they just spontaneously happen
<Vivix> Someone had a camera, a guy started singing, BAM
<Saturn> 08,01like a storm, but with dancing
<Saturn> 08,01and almost-kissing
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Life would be so weird if people spontaniusly burst into song
<Vivix> Weird but magical-
<Vivix> sort of
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: it's a little known fact that bollywood films are all documentaries
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: ppl should do that more
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/yFoUl.jpg
<Vivix> That is true
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: there's an episode of Buffy to that effect
<Jmo> Meanwhile got it.
<alexxm> Eli but conserding todays music would it be worth it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would love a episode that mocks that trope
<Meanwhile> Zoom zoom roboda.
<Jmo> Ahaha
<Jmo> I miss that movie
<SpadeMagnes[School]> People just questioning why theres random singing
<Dken2021> anyways, shower~!
<Vivix> The best part in that movie was the mosquitos
<Meanwhile> That bit made no sense at all.
<Eli> alexxm: uh no... kill me. if anyone starts singing Rihanna next to me i kick them in the balls
<Vivix> Eeexactly
<Meanwhile> He can talk to mosquitoes...because.
<Vivix> and the mosquitos are all gang members
<GilDash> That film was... interesting?
<Meanwhile> Yo you best watch yoself on this turf or I'mma give you hepatitis.
<Jmo> That film was the bomb.
<Eli> Meanwhile: and malaria
<Meanwhile> That film was really weird when you get down to it.
<Saturn> 08,01i started singing Gangnam Style on the bus in Dundee the other day
<Eli> Meanwhile: thinking about it, they were heavily armed
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Only really weird?
<Saturn> 08,01everyone got up and started dancing
<Saturn> 08,01it was magical
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Apperently my Black2/White2 guide book has two volumes
<Saturn> 08,01okay... that didn't *actually* happen
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The first volume is the walktrough
<GilDash> Saturn: Damn. That sounds like one hell of a ride...
<Meanwhile> Dundee?
<Vivix> Apparently Hyneas aren't canines
<GilDash> Saturn: Oh, you bastard. XD
<Vivix> Did they all just look at you..like.."?"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The entire 2nd one is the national pokedex and stuff for like tournaments alone
<Saturn> 08,01Dundee is life's hardest game
<Eli> we should organize some Gangam flashmobs all around the world
<Meanwhile> Tours of Dundee, on the left you'll see Dundee town hall, on the right you'll see a woman being burnt at the stake.
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: first one will be at your house
<Eli> Saturn: sure
<Eli> Saturn: my little brother loves that song
<Saturn> 08,01okay, let's all go to Eli's house
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: do you live with you mum?
<Eli> Saturn: still. yeah..
<Jmo> Rofl
<Saturn> 08,01dibs on her.
*Saturn 08,01runs
<Sumica> 00,10um, wrek when they are on fire like that they burn to the ground
<Eli> Saturn: ohh nooo that's just nasty
<Eli> Saturn: you don^'t want her believe me
<AnFo> At least you're honest. :x
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: is she deformed?
<Saturn> 08,01and does it run in the family?
<Jmo> Yo mamma is deformed yo.
<Eli> Saturn: na. and yes
<Saturn> 08,01my god, why am i so nasty today?
<Meanwhile> Yo mamma look like the elephant man.
<Jmo> it's nasty day.
<Eli> Saturn: i have 3 arms
<Jmo> LOl
<Saturn> 08,01i'm so sorry Eli, i'm in a silly mood
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Who pissed in your cornflakes?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Today? Aren't you always? :P
<Lil_B> Eli the Last Brony Meetup I went too... Gangnam Style... everyxone, everyhwere, all the time...

<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: i'm lovely!
<Eli> Saturn: fine by me. my nickname with my best friend is "son of a bitch". it's normal around here, i can take it
<Jmo> osnap.
<Saturn> 08,01fair enough
<Eli> Lil_B: you went to a brony meet up?
<Meanwhile> Enough half assed attempts to convey gang accent through text.
<Vivix> I once saw Yo Mama on MTV
<Vivix> It hurt my everything
<Jmo> Poor diddums.
<Vivix> ;_;
<Lil_B> Eli yeah, Franfurt am Main have been there 2 times now
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh MTV when you used to show music
<Vivix> Oh the good old days
<Vivix> before MTV became TV
<Meanwhile> MTV showed music. Once upon a time.
<Eli> Vivix: well yo mama went past my tv to get something. i missed five episodes of mlp
<Jmo> loltv
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So the legends say
<Meanwhile> LONG AGO IN A DISTANT LAND.
<Vivix> Oooh Snaaap Eli
<Saturn> 08,01yo mama so classy, she turned up to a LAN party in a ball gown
<Lil_B> Eli I even know that Last time, there was a Swiss Brony Group who traveled there for the Frankfurt Meetup :)
<Meanwhile> I, Aku, the shapeshifting master of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil.
<Saturn> 08,01am i doing this right?
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Jmo> Yeah you sure are.
<Vivix> "YO mama so fine."
<Vivix> No punchline
<Eli> Lil_B: i hate and envy you sooooo much right now
<Meanwhile> But a foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me.
*Saturn 08,01once held a formal LAN party, for realsies
<Saturn> 08,01*formal dress
<Saturn> 08,01yo mama was there
<Lil_B> Eli <3 you too :3
<Jmo> I'd love to turn up to a LAN party in a tuxedo
<Vivix> I went to a Lan once, everyone watched movies and porn
<Saturn> 08,01the ball gown didn't stay on very long.
<Meanwhile> Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time and flung him into the future, where my evil is law, and MTV doesn't actually play music.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile: you monster
<Meanwhile> Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is Jersey Shore.
<Vivix> You were the producer of Jersey Shore weren't you?
<Eli> i never had a lanparty or anything like that
<Vivix> Mean W Hile
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: :D
<Meanwhile> The W stands for honesty.
<GilDash> Saturn: A formal LAN party? That sounds... quite fun, actually. XD
<Vivix> liar!
<Eli> sad fact: i don't even really have friends in switzerland :)
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: it was!

<ASoftFluffyThing> fluttershyftw15, AdBlock Plus is your friend
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Xaiden: I rarely play the PS3 lately but I do play Uncharted 3 online and some Motorstorm :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt Peta use to dump blood on people?
<Kurra> i love fluffolocation too ;;
<Vivix> adblock is only blocking bronystate and writing.com to m
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350317517377.png
<Meanwhile> You wrote a half assed version jaymoo, you don't count.
<Jmo> Aw.
<Jmo> Fine.
<Eli> why would you adblock porn? seriously guys.
<Vivix> Cuz its bad porn :(
<Xaiden> NewSuperBronyU: Bro, Uncharted 3 is my life. We should play sometime
<Jmo> Cause I don't admire it.
<Meanwhile> Because seriously, not everyone wants to see that.
<GilDash> Why does Handsome Jack's face there remind me of Repo!
<AJIsAwesome> Because some of us don't like porn? :S
<ASoftFluffyThing> Eli, because you don't want that stuff showing up when you're trying to watch something else
<AJIsAwesome> It's as simple as that.
<Eli> ASoftFluffyThing: true that
<ASoftFluffyThing> Eli yep
*Ponyloverforever drinkin coke
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Has PETA ever done anything good for the rest of the world, besides look like a bunch of assholes?
*Jmo rolls around fluffy
<Jmo> oopa
<Xaiden> GilDash: I hate not having borderlands 2 in the sense that i have no idea what your talking about
<Xaiden> :\
<ASoftFluffyThing> SpadeMagnes[School], none that I know of.
<Jmo> Yeah they stopped Vivix from beating up ponies.
<Vivix> PeTA has probably harmed more animals than they sved, only good is probably Vivisection awareness
<GilDash> Xaiden: I don't actually own it either.
<Jmo> Go PETA.
<Vivix> <,<
<Vivix> I don't beaat ponies..I..something
<GilDash> Xaiden: In fact, I've never played it. :(
<Jmo> Oh god keep it to yourself.
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[School]: Probably. But after so much of the crap that they have done good luck finding it.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Xaiden: Yeah :D PM me your PSN ID and I'll add you as a friend :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Vivix, describe this "something"
<Xaiden> GilDash: Oh, well that makes 2 of us
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Peta harms animals?
<Wrek> 05most lately up here
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350320527033.gif
<Wrek> 05PETA cut open some salmon farms nets
<Wrek> 05casuing hundreds of salmons to die from starvation
<Jmo> I want a Team PETA shirt.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Idiots
*Ponyloverforever *BLEALCH*
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Vivix> ASoftFluffyThing, <,<..no
<Jmo> Trout is better.
<Bronysith> PETA=exact embodiement of dumbass
<Jmo> Fluffy, you don't wanna know.
<MadSurge> Vivix: yeah :| that's why it's silly that they criticized Pokemon when the current villains are an animal "wrong" group
<Jmo> SRSLY
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Daww <3
<Meanwhile> Congrats, you successfully managed to save salmon from being eaten, and got them starved instead.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Didnt they dump buckets of blood on people at one point?
*ASoftFluffyThing doesn't ask anymore
<Vivix> but yeah PeTA is harming animals inadvertently, so if you really want animal rights, you are best to go to serious organization-
<Jmo> Vivix is nasty.
<Jmo> Leave it at that.
<Vivix> :3
<Eli> it's not wrong to protect animals! PETA just does it wrong
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02PETA: The organization that loves every species other than their own.
<Vivix> Yeah, pretty much Eli
<Vivix> They also use nuidty and celebrities to promote their cause, which in turn kinda hurts it
<Buytoast> PETA
<GilDash> PETA can't even look after other animals right, forget their own.
<Buytoast> loving species
<x1es> The people for extorsion, terrorism and arson.
<MadSurge> Vivix: go to a dog pound and take care of the animals
<Vivix> Why would someon stop buying fur because naked woman?
<Buytoast> that's a lie and you know it
<Vivix> yeah- do local work, help out
<Jmo> 'take care' of the animals
<Meanwhile> I can sympathise with hating people, people by and large are terrible, but PETA has this incredible ability to not see the results of their actions.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What other stupid shit has peta done
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: i'm not opposed to hating humans. we really are the bane of this poor planet. but yeah, nature has survived worse
<Ponyloverforever> i want stream ><
<Ponyloverforever> :<
<Buytoast> they see the results
<Buytoast> they just dont care
<Wrek> 05love how they complain that the method to kill animals for food processing is inhumane and stuff, when how we execute humans are even more painful and inhumane
<Jmo> I want world peace.
<Jmo> See me getting it?
<Wrek> 05pro tip, never take the lethal injection
<Wrek> 05take a big nail to the frontal lobe
<Ponyloverforever> Jmo: same here
<Wrek> 05best way to die
<Jmo> loljks
<Vivix> the method we slaughter animals wiht now is probably the most humane when done by a good company, bad companies get shit rep anyway
<GilDash> It's fanatasism. That will always be the most dangerous aspect of man.
<MadSurge> Jmo: an animal refuge, you get what I mean :D
<Meanwhile> Surely the pro-tip would be don't get caught.
<Jmo> Yeah but this Vivix.
<Jmo> Don't let him near animals
<Vivix> I loove animals ;__;
<Meanwhile> Or commit crimes somewhere that they don't practice the death penalty.
<Meanwhile> Or...you know, just not commit crimes.
<Jmo> Don't wanna know yur love.
<Jmo> your*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Peta's games are utter bullshit
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> PETA games are GOTY.
<Eli> me too Vivix, me too
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: and they're easy to troll :D
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I don't see PETA protecting all the other animals in wildlife from killing each other nor converting lions into vegans.
<Dken2021> dang it, are we talking about peta now?
<Vivix> Yeah, some things just have to happen
<CrimsonPhoenix> NewSuperBronyU, very good point
<Wrek> 05being omnivores
<Vivix> What we should ensure is ethical treatment
<Wrek> 05we arent supposed to be vegan
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: that something completely else
<Vivix> and that does not meen stop providing meat to meat eating us
<Wrek> 05heck vegitarian is pushign it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Does peta actualy do anything to the animals they "save"?
<Bronysith> PETA= DUMBFUCKS
<Jmo> meat to meat
<Buytoast> they kill them
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[School]: Most of them are euthanised.
<Buytoast> literally
<Buytoast> they just killem dead
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How is that saving them
<Vivix> No idea
<Meanwhile> It's not.
<Jmo> So much hate, PETA is cool.
<Buytoast> because they aren't being abused
<Wrek> 05anotehr thing
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Eli: Is it really? Animals eat other animals to survive, and they do it by their own means as well. Humans do the same thing.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> SO...killing them is the next best option?
<Vivix> It's also how they have a biased uneducated opinion on animal psychology that makes them make bad decisions
<Jmo> Killing rats isn't cool.
<Wrek> 05peta is agaisnt usign animals formedicinal research
<Wrek> 05well fun fact, 3 of their chairman wouldnt be alive today without that research
<CrimsonPhoenix> Eli news flash
<CrimsonPhoenix> WE ARE ANIMALS
<Jmo> I'm not.
<Buytoast> it's true
<Wrek> 05they are diabetic adn insulin comes from animal research
<Jmo> I'm a muffin.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Because we should be using sticks and rocks for testing out miracle drugs that can cure deadly diseases.
<Wrek> 05so hah
<Buytoast> hell, i even fling my filth on the trains
<Meanwhile> Without animal research medical practice would be years behind.
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: i don't know... all the anti peta arguments up here start to sound like the PETA arguments themselfes. can we just stop?
<Jmo> ^wtf
*CrimsonPhoenix eats Jmo
<Jmo> Noooooo.
<Jmo> Don't eat me yo, not cool.
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350289024163.png
<Meanwhile> I don't agree with unneccessarily cruel methods, or cosmetic testing, but medicine has a purpose.
<CrimsonPhoenix> But you're a delicious muffin though
<Vivix> yes, medecine, food, important things
<Jmo> O U.
<CrimsonPhoenix> you don't want me to go get Derpy
<CrimsonPhoenix> do you?
<Jmo> Oh please get Derpy.

<SpadeMagnes[School]> What the hell do vegans even eat?
<Vivix> If you overstate PeTA, you can say that having a pet is kidnapping
<Meanwhile> dust.
<Jmo> Sand
<Meanwhile> Fucking grass pulp, I don't know.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im pretty sure humans need meat to survive
<Meanwhile> They don't, realistically.
<Wrek> 05SpadeMagnes[School] not really
<Bronysith> we need protein
<Vivix> True, we don't, but it's one way of survival
<Meanwhile> But if you off nothing but water and nuts you eventually resemble a twig.
<Bronysith> and meat has a lot of protein
<Wrek> 05but its a way better source for certain vitamisn etc than the bean counterpart
<Meanwhile> you live off*
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: we don't need it. but you would have to take tons of other shit to replace teh nutriments
<Vivix> bugs and other plant types can give us enoguh protein
<Wrek> 05which you would need to consume in shitloads anyways
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Eli: Kind of tough to just stop a discussion when it doesn't go against the rules and hasn't really gone into a flame war or anything.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So what stuff besides meat has enough protien so you can live?
<Jmo> Sand
<Meanwhile> A lot of nuts.
<Vivix> The only things we should stop in meat industry is cruel and painful upbringing or methods
<Wrek> 05beans, nuts
<Meanwhile> So yeah, vegans eat nuts.
<Vivix> we're doing pretty good there
<Brad[Laptop]> lol sand
<Meanwhile> Make of that what you will.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nuts have a lot of protein.
<Jmo> We shall live off sand for life.
<Jmo> It has everything we need
<Vivix> Sand and Snow
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: yeah... i see that. i have nothing against a friendly discussion, but what we're doing now i a pointles rant against peta
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Being a vegan sounds so retarded
<Brad[Laptop]> Reminds me of Kevin O
<Wrek> 05not eally Eli
*Kurra distractts you all with James Turrell!
<Brad[Laptop]> Kevin Oleary telling a lady that her product tastes like sand.
<Wrek> 0580% of the pointers here have been true
<Meanwhile> Well most people are vegan for ethical reasons.
<Vivix> I support animal protection of most kinds, but PeTA is something I feel is damaging the cause- so I don't like them
<Wrek> 05facts
<Kurra> James Turrell, guys! James! Turrell!
<Jmo> It's all lies.
<Meanwhile> They don't agree with how animals are treated, I can respect that to a degree but I still think it's bonkers.
<Eli> Wrek: yeah. i wouldn't be too sure about that
<Jmo> Nothing is true in this world~
<Buytoast> boy, if only i could find that image about peta
<Dark_Horst> fact: steak is delicious
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Eli: How is it pointless? We're discussing the opposing arguments against their actions with unbiased opinions.
<Wrek> 05for isntance?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Animals are people too,no not really
<Lil_B> Vivix I must send you a Picture >.< (has nothing to do with the current discussion) -.-
<Vivix> I think they're biased, because they choose what is and what isn't ethical based on their own ethics, not the animals --comfort
<Vivix> Mm? Send away Lil_B
<Meanwhile> Everyone is biased.
<Meanwhile> There is no such thing as an unbiased opinion.
<Vivix> Yeah, but as an organization, they could have done more research to base their manifest on
<Jmo> I like trains.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I see being a vegetarian as a noble thing, but I think PETA should be happy if people just simply cut back on their meat intake instead.
<Vivix> True-
<Eli> Wrek: i just don't belive they do everything THAT wrong. i'm sure an organisation that's for animals has it's good points too
<Wrek> 05aye
<Vivix> not just for animals, but for human food --not enoughing--verb please
<Buytoast> hold on eli
<Buytoast> hold on
<Buytoast> just
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Buytoast> hold on eli
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02We're not saying they're doing everything wrong, but they are priding themselves on what the extremists do.
<Jmo> Hold onto your chair.
<Dken2021> allo Nitty!
<Wrek> 05sure eli
<Wrek> 05but one thing i want you to do
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Nittany_Discord. :)
<Vivix> I just think there are better organizations out there
<Wrek> 05watch the penn & tellers bullshit on peta
<Eli> Buytoast: there are fanatics in every organisation. would you like to be judged by the worst brony?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So peta wants everyone to chew on plant life for the rest of time
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Cutting open salmon farm nets isn't the effective and legal way of dealing with animal cruelty.
<Wrek> 05and the evidence speaks for itself
<Meanwhile> Penn & Teller, put that on stream some time <3
<Vivix> Releasing minks from a minkfarm gives them hours fo pain and suffering
<Jmo> Hippies gone wrong.
<Buytoast> worst brony is a poor statement
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<Buytoast> they're all bad
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: fanatics
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Buytoast: O U
<Wrek> 05it all comes down to this
<Wrek> 05extremists and fundamentalists of any kind
<Wrek> 05are inherently bad
<Meanwhile> Amen.
<Wrek> 05dangerous and deterioate society
<Eli> Wrek: that
<Vivix> Yeah
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Eli: There's a difference between fanatics and extremists.
<GilDash> Fanatasism. Already said that.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So how exactly is scantily clad women supposed to make me go vegan?
<Jmo> Simple
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[School]: Boobs sell anything, that's how they work.
<Jmo> ^
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[School] can scanily clad women make you do anything?
<Vivix> But boobs make me want to NOT buy something-
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Wouldn't that make you want more meat though? ;)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not really
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm a huge fan of My Little Pony, but you don't see me going to paint horses that don't belong to me in different colors or torturing someone else to be a brony because it's the 'right' thing to do.
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Badum tish.
<Jmo> LOl
<Jmo> Vivix does that.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Thank you, I'm here all week. XD
<Vivix> Nuh huh!
<Jmo> Goes to the stable and paints the horses.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dont have a issue with naked women but the way they try to get people to go vegan is stupid
<Wrek> 05still no stream?
<Brad[Laptop]> LOL painting peoples horses… theres a good idea...
<Vivix> I doon't paaint them ;__;
<MadSurge> Wrek: nope
<Jmo> Don't lie.
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: Nope.
<Wrek> 05jsut cause i can
<Wrek> 05gona do this
<Chrysalis> Wrek doesnt look like it
<Eli> NewSuperBronyU: you don't, but i have seen painted horses
<Brad[Laptop]> I don't like real horses at all.
<Meanwhile> I'm totally just gonna go hose my neighbours horse with pink dye now.
<Jmo> ^
<Vivix> I love real horses
<Jmo> I bet you do.
<Xaiden> Wrek: you WERE streaming only 5 minutes ago, nobodys given a damn as of yet I guess
<Jmo> Nasty Vivix.
<Vivix> They're cute and nice ;__;
<CrimsonPhoenix> NewSuperBronyU, I love you just saying
<Vivix> SCARY, but nice
<Brad[Laptop]> Jmo you just have one great comment after another.
<Jmo> Go see a counselor
<Meanwhile> Scary butt fun.
<Vivix> ;___;
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Don't we all? :D
<Jmo> Thanks Brad :>
<GilDash> My aunt has a farm with horses on it. I like them, but their mouths kind of freak me out. :S
<Vivix> I like nuzzling their muzzles-
<Meanwhile> Their...mouths?
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PNt6DjlvT0&feature=g-all-lik No stream?
<Vivix> the only thing that freaks me out is their eyes. GOAT eyes!
<Buytoast> ah, here it is
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So how exactly was Peta allowed to make a game with Mario and luigi in it and not get their asses sued?
<Buytoast> http://i.imgur.com/jfsOR.jpg enlighten yourself Eli
<Brad[Laptop]> Horses smell bad.
<Vivix> noo
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Yeah. Like when they yawn. :S
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: they got big teeth! And they bite if nervous
<Vivix> Of the farm animals, horses smell the best
<Panda|Napping> GilDash, if their mouths are what freak you out... maybe I should tell you my story...
<Jmo> so does Vivix.
<Vivix> !
<Meanwhile> So...don't make them nervous.
*twilight_sprinkle burns Bronysith on a stick
<Meanwhile> It's not that hard to stand away from a horse.
<GilDash> Panda|Napping: That's up to you. :S
<Dark_Horst> Buytoast: it's too small
<Eli> Buytoast: ... yeah, seen that before
<Buytoast> then squint
<Jmo> Slap a horse on the arse and it'll be your friend
<Xaiden> Pinkie Style? Never saw that coming?
<Vivix> Even a horse that is freaking out will try to avoid running you over
<Meanwhile> Unless it has made you it's mortal enemy in this life and decided that it will risk it's entire existence to put you in hell.
<Chrysalis> STREAM
<Vivix> or so I learned
*Panda|Homework slaps Jmo's ass
<Buytoast> oh boy, time for bullshit?

<MadSurge> Ponyloverforever: same.
<Vivix> I like some meat, but a lot of it I just odn't like the taste of
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, and peta is free to kill about every animal they find?
<StinkomanFan> Chrysalis would know what love is
<Vivix> but there's one thing I can't eat, and that's DEER
<Ponyloverforever> and ive got a kitten called lilly
<Xaiden> After just reading Animal Farm, this is hilarious
<Cypresswolf> I'm quite certain if PETA had their way, no one would be able to own "pets"
<Chrysalis> StinkomanFan of course
<Meanwhile> He has crazy eyes.
<StinkomanFan> Puppy :)
<MadSurge> I like pigs' meat, but I like pigs as animals too :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Cypresswolf: Because animals are people too?
<StinkomanFan> DOGGIES
<Vivix> Pets are kidnapped animals! Animal consent don't exist! Rararar
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Same here.
<Cypresswolf> something like that, yes
<killerpony7733> Yay stupidity
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Animals are not people
<killerpony7733> ^
<Jmo> Tell that to yo mama.

<Ponyloverforever> why do you have to nuder them anyway we need more animals
<Panda|Homework> animals > Humans
<Shizuka> 13we want animal immortality?
<Meanwhile> We want to abolish...death.
<GilDash> When they're desperate, feral and will do anything to survive...
<Vivix> It's not just that, it's how PeTA sometimes refuses to accept that animals can accept and be happy in situations that PetA considers wrong
<Metronome> kill cow: Ok :/ Kill dogs: EVILLLLLD:<
<Lil_B> his Husband looked worried
<Dark_Horst> then shopot a bullet through your head, peta

<MadSurge> Shizuka: :D

<Magical_Pablez94> Panda|Homework
<Shizuka> 13i want to start PETH
<Cypresswolf> I'm just controlling the surplus animal population - left unchecked (feral hogs for example) the animals wreak havoc on other species - eating the food other species need to survive
<StinkomanFan> ASPCA are better :s
<Vivix> MadSurge, yeah, animals aren't completely incapable of displaying emotions that they have, so-- yeah animals can enjoy compainoship, like being a pet
<Jmo> Rofl
<Shizuka> 13people for the ethical treatment of humans
<StinkomanFan> Puppy!
<Panda|Homework> Shizuka FUND IT!
<Meanwhile> Good luck flying that past the government.
<killerpony7733> SpadeMagnes[School] It's called making something human. We humans are good at that. We humanise objects and many other things calling them things or giving them names
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Can any of you people honestly say animals are as smart as us
<Pink3> Ponyloverforever: do you want thousands of strays dieing everyday,that is called overpopulating...tons of them wouldnt have a home,and there would be so many,that it would become normal to have thousands of animals on the street. and they would be miserable :'( :'( :'(
<Magical_Pablez94> Panda|Homework... nice to see you again. i miis you a bit...
<Vivix> Smart doesn't matter
<twilight_sprinkle> ow

<MadSurge> Shizuka: make that cats too :(
<Magical_Pablez94> Panda|Homework that's why...
<Chrysalis> ewww

<Panda|Homework> GilDash its a vicious cycle, no? I'm glad that I work where I live XD
<Vivix> Oh, just thought I'd throw that out there

<Prince_Lightstar> ITZ ZE HOLY BIBLE BOIS
<StinkomanFan> Alchemist, actually we watched this once before and the only arguement we had was on the definition of the word "Theory"
<SirGanjalf> i assume, Wrek played "Bullshit" on PETA, previously?
<Eli> does the little guy actually ever talk?
<MadSurge> SirGanjalf: yep
<CriticKitten> ...wat?
<CountDoofus> Once I appear here, the average IQ in this room drops by at least 100 points. Haio, everybrony.

<SirGanjalf> Teller is the Gordon Freeman of comedy:P
<MadSurge> Eli: he's more talkative during their magician shows
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord i think they are trying to minimise the anonymity that comes with commenting
<Alchemist> StinkomanFan: there isnt much to argue about. there is an everyday definition and the scientific term. thats all.
<Saturn> 08,01in this case, he was showing he respects Richard Dawkins

<Bronysith> Saturn: yes, it is ...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Bye, Ponyloverforever. :)
<CountDoofus> One of my friends is an atheist. He'd get a kick out of this.
<Eli> there are trees older than that

<Alchemist> Eli: try to watch a few clips about Kent Hovind. Your blood will boil.
<Vordox> <--- Lives in Sweden, the most se...se...what's the name Wrek in English? Sekulativt?
<Prince_Lightstar> Saturn: good lookin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm Christian, but not a fanatic. I'm also a scientist.
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Wrek> 05secular
<Prince_Lightstar> :O
<Saturn> 08,01Sexy (n): Sexually attractive or exciting.
<Bronysith> Saturn: you
<Lil_B> I saw the red powder there...
<twilight_sprinkle> what, he just put some chemicals in the glass
<Mutterguy> When I was 12 I got the Science teacher to admit that venus was hotter than mercury because of the Atmosphere. GREENHOUSE EFFECT
<Vordox> Thanks, Swedish is one of the most secular country in the world
<CriticKitten> It's adorable mostly because the Jewish faith (you know, the guys who wrote the Old Testament) acknowledge that the Old Testament's account of creation is meant as an educational parable to help demonstrate the concept of original sin.
<Buytoast> oh man
<killerpony7733> Haha it wasn't proven?
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: and for that you're awesome :)
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: <3
<Meanwhile> The bible is a theory with much less credit.
<Dark_Horst> yeah. and bacteria changes becasue it feels like it. no evolution at all
<alexxm> red necks red necks everywhere
<Bronysith> Saturn: <3
<Eli> i have absolutely nothing against believers. but srsly... don't talk shit like that
<Buytoast> need proof for evolution, and yet push for the bible to be taught as scientific fact
<Shizuka> 13so fun fact, the catechism of the catholic church accepts evolution (mostly, personally i think they fall closer to deism than intelligent design BS)
<thisguy> yee-haw :P
<Pink3> Evolution Is Ridiculous
<Eli> they proved evolution
<CriticKitten> So the only people who believe in creationism are Christians who don't actually understand the Old Testament as it's written.
<Bronysith> Wrek: i live in cobb county... KMN
<Vordox> "historical"?
<Prince_Lightstar> Saturn: ending chat now boop now being ignored
<Pink3> I am an ape if evolution is real
<Metronome> Religion is theory right?
<Dken2021> CriticKitten pretty much yea
<Meanwhile> Pink3: You are an ape.
<Shizuka> 13and quote: "Creationists naively take biblical data literally (for example, to calculate the earth's age, they cite the six days of work in genesis 1)"
<Barbetos|AtWork> whats wrong with that girls face!
<Wrek> 05fun fact
<Pink3> Meanwhile: :L
<Wrek> 05virgin birth is a translation error
<Prince_Lightstar> brb
<Vordox> Wrek. <.<
<Wrek> 05it was young woman
<Shizuka> 13the goddamn pope remarks that creationists are misguided :3
<thisguy> o.O
<Wrek> 05not virgin
<Eli> well.... all these ppl at least proved natural selection wrong
<Bronysith> Wrek: holy fuck naggits, really?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Quote?
<Dken2021> Wrek interesting
<MadSurge> Shizuka: IKR
<GriffonCherry> Shizuka: You mean design bronystate right?
<Prince_Lightstar> bak
<CountDoofus> Jersey Shore in enough proof we evolved from primates. The amount of intelligence in there is staggering.
<Wrek> 05from hebrew(?) to greek to latin to english
<Wrek> 05i think
<thisguy> blegh too much creationist talk, make brain hurt >_>
<Saturn> 08,01Prince_Lightstar: fair enough; i was just goading you anyway
<Wrek> 05some order of those
<StinkomanFan> SCIENCE
<CriticKitten> Wrek: Doesn't surprise me. It's been suggested that a lot of the New Testament is....somewhat glorified? :D
<Prince_Lightstar> Saturn: thank u
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<Buytoast> it hurts
<Vordox> Intelligent Design?
<Spectrum_Rush> http://tinyurl.com/83xcc43c >_><_<>_><_<
<Bronysith> Wrek: im pretty sure theres a shit load of mistranslation, lost in translation, and my personal fav, ADDED during translation
<Shizuka> 13mostly quote, it's a annotated guide to the catechism that was put together under the current pope
<Dken2021> I feel the bible is more of a guideline for life, not a literal rulebook
<Prince_Lightstar> i want to play tf2 but it fails
<Tovler> I'm waiting for the next patch before I pass judgment on creationism.
<Eli> HOW IS THAT SCIENTIFIC YOU FUCKTARD?
<Meanwhile> Because he said it in a complicated way.
<Meanwhile> That's how it works.
<StinkomanFan> Can't we just think that God created two ameobas and EVERYTHING evolved from them?
<SirGanjalf> And that "Intelligent Design" excludes evolution, because...?
<twilight_sprinkle> easy there Eli :P
<Saturn> 08,01this is why i don't ever want to live in america
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<Eli> sorry twilight_sprinkle
<Bronysith> Saturn: can i move to scotland plz
<Buytoast> America is terrible
<Chrysalis> +1 to that Saturn
<GilDash> That's not how scientific theory works.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: its ok, how are you btw :P
<Lil_B> Thats why I wanna go to Canada
<Buytoast> it's sliding down a shitty, slippery slope
<Meanwhile> What Saturn said.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Saturn it ain't so bad
<Eli> hi btw twilight_sprinkle
<Saturn> 08,01certainly would never want to bring up children in america
<thelonepony> Saturn: I wish i was at Mexican than here :/
<Saturn> 08,01Barbetos|AtWork: please do!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01America is still better than some places.
<CriticKitten> What evidence they do show? They show NONE.
<Dken2021> StinkomanFan but that contridicts what creationist belive
*Spectrum_Rush curse you tinyul, you have failed me
<thelonepony> Mexico*
<thisguy> times like these, i'd like to vacation in equestria to get away from all this -.-
<CriticKitten> They present NOTHING.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: please do!
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: ^
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile God's watching this show and laughing his ass off.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Imagine raising kids in Iran or Iraq.
<Prince_Lightstar> thelonepony: mexico not mexican
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Isn't bad :P
<Bronysith> Saturn: <3
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: fine fine. just can't belive what ppl believe
<RaveBrony> Saturn: Aw, I turned out alright D:
<GilDash> Because if you looked at it critcally "Intelligent Design" wouldn't exist in the first place.
<twilight_sprinkle> all countries have their own problems
<Shizuka> 13hm actually it has a definition of evolution in the sidebar here... "evolution (latin evolutio = unfolding, development), the growth of the final form of organisms over millions of years; viewed from a christian perspective, evolution takes place as god's continuous creation in natural processes"
<Wrek> 05i dont mind religious people i jsut disagree with them. the onyl reason i dont want to live in america is casue they dont consider medical care a human right
<Prince_Lightstar> <_<
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord´Pakistan, they are worse religion wise
<twilight_sprinkle> china, russia, other slavic countries, iran, iraq
<Barbetos|AtWork> Saturn: I would not want my kids in the schools here though.
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Prince_Lightstar> eyup
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: that as well
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least Americans can speak against their country and not get beheaded.
<Saturn> 08,01Barbetos|AtWork: send them to school in the netherlands
<Buytoast> oh boy, pulling the family card
<Colt_Brovakiin> I saw this somewhere that is is funny how on the american dollar it says 'In god we trust' and on the british pound it has a picture of darwin :P
<Meanwhile> They can?
<Vordox> Wait, takes place as God's co...what?
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: is. iran banned WOW becasue of false propaganda of mythology and slutty display of female avatars
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: true dat
<CriticKitten> For now, Nitt.
<Saturn> 08,01the dutch education system is great
<Eli> as if he would let her choose
<Meanwhile> I thought being in America and saying America sucks was grounds for being stoned.
<doctor_whooves127> the only problem i have with evolution is the change from single celled to multi-celled organisms
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: there are people that believe anything, ive accepted that a while ago. some think ponies are satanic :D
<SirGanjalf> Welp, send them to private school then.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Only on Fox News.
<Tovler> Religion. Follow along and no one gets hurt.
<Buytoast> But if you trash-talk Amrica, you're obviously a terrorist.
<SirGanjalf> "I thought this was AMERICA?"
<Barbetos|AtWork> Saturn: Yeah. Kids are not even an option untill I can support my self, and like several other peoples if I wanted to.
<Vordox> Wow, that metaphor.
<CriticKitten> By the way, Meanwhile, where's your flag pin?!?
<CriticKitten> D:<
<thisguy> lol?
<StinkomanFan> Thank you bald man!
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: My what?
<Prince_Lightstar> im bak
<thisguy> hi
<Prince_Lightstar> poped out
<Alchemist> murica
<twilight_sprinkle> a lot of americans realize that there are problems in america, they arent considered terrorists or anythng bad.
<Buytoast> AMERICA, m'kay?
<Conyst> Go bald man.
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Your flag pin. Every AMERICAN wears a flag pin. Only godless communist socialist nazis would refuse to wear a flag pin.
<CriticKitten> :P
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: I'm English.
<Prince_Lightstar> im waitin 4 steam files to validat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It'd be nice if both were taught and then the kids allowed to make up their own mind.
<CriticKitten> (or so goes the Fox News narrative)
<Buytoast> AMERICA, AMERICA
<Prince_Lightstar> its so long >_>
<Buytoast> GOD FRIES MY FOOD FOR ME
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: A LIKELY EXCUSE!
<thisguy> yeah, but we aint that lucky
<Saturn> 08,01i think there should be a sticker in all the bibles too: YMMV.
<Colt_Brovakiin> I kind of think it is all brainwashing children into religion...
<Tovler> bald guy doesn't seem strong. I'll listen to the loud and proud creationist instead.
<StinkomanFan> BUNNY
<MadSurge> Bunny! :3
<SirGanjalf> bunneh
<Vordox> Clearly, female :P
<alexxm> the cute little bunny
<Prince_Lightstar> BUNNY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01YMMV?
<Eli> i like tellers tie
<Conyst> CriticKitten: Drat you found me. I have never worn a flag pin
<GilDash> It'd be nice if the facts were acknowledged as facts and not covered up...
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: Your Milage May Vary
<CriticKitten> Prince!
<CriticKitten> XD
<Eli> i want that tie
<SirGanjalf> wat

<thisguy> bunneh <3 :3
<twilight_sprinkle> prince dabbit
<ASoftFluffyThing> CriticKitten, I'm American and I don't want a flag pin unless the pin is for the New Lunar Republic, the Solar Empire, or the Gryffindor House flag
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: you have no idea, well maybe you do
<Meanwhile> Dat rabbit.
<Chrysalis> rabbitsexnostic
<SirGanjalf> umm, Teller, what are you doing?
<Saturn> 08,01i used to have 2 rabbits
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: THE HOLY BIBLE (some restrictions apply, results may vary, void where prohibited)
<Saturn> 08,01i named them Pixel and Nybble
<Jmo> Rabbit stew.
<Prince_Lightstar> checkin if its female or prince
<thisguy> my mom loves rabbits, they're her fav pet
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: <3
<StinkomanFan> :O
<Barbetos|AtWork> THis is going to be the next A movie.
<Prince_Lightstar> so many fans
<Barbetos|AtWork> I put up
<Barbetos|AtWork> for my vote.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: you get a raspberyy muffin for that
<Barbetos|AtWork> Complete.
<CriticKitten> ASoftFluffyThing: I don't wear one at all. But Fox News flat out attacked people in 2008's election because they didn't wear flag pins.
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thought.
<CriticKitten> ASoftFluffyThing: I'm dead serious.
<Colt_Brovakiin> what a grumpy looking bastard
<Conyst> Ban Books How dare they:[
<Saturn> 08,01i hate rabbits
<Alchemist> inb4 discovery isntitute
<Prince_Lightstar> do the kirby dance
<ASoftFluffyThing> CriticKitten: Fox News should be destroyed.
<Vordox> Evidence...?
<Meanwhile> The bible, the following is a work of fiction and any resemblance to any persons living or dead is entirely coincidental...
<GilDash> I've got a Holy Bible... it looks like swiss cheese. XD
<Vordox> LOOK AROUND YOUR
<Vordox> *self
<Shizuka> 13the problem is there is no evidence of creationism, it's merely an interpretation of evolution's findings
<Eli> what evidence is there?
<SirGanjalf> e
<StinkomanFan> ...Was the Bunny a Male, Female, or Prince?
<Buytoast> THE ONLY EVIDENCE I NEED IS THE GOOD BOOK OF JESUS
<Lil_B> I understand this mans point actually
<SirGanjalf> Meanwhile: :D
<Eli> GilDash: nothing against my cheese
<Buytoast> MURIKA
<Prince_Lightstar> <(0.0<) <(0.0)> (>0.0)>
<Dark_Horst> you know, you NEED to have evidence to present it
<Conyst> Clearly prince
<Dark_Horst> creationist shitheAD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All American news is biased. We really need a professional news source.
<GilDash> Or do the call it a Holy Bible because of all the holes in their 'theories'?
<Shizuka> 13the closest you get to marrying the two is deism, that a god created the initial conditions for the universe and then let it run
<Prince_Lightstar> i cant kirby dance
<Eli> GilDash: and hey! our chees doesn't ahve holes
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/m8ywM
<Dken2021> Nittany_Discord oh boy do we really need one
<Prince_Lightstar> :'(:S
<Jmo> Do the Truffle Shuffle instead.
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord Just about all the worlds news is biased to a point
<CrimsonPhoenix> "wreathe" how do you guys pronounce that?
<Shizuka> 13also if you're ever really really really bored, actually read the bible from page one
<SirGanjalf> GilDash: I read Bible for the plot... holes:P
<Prince_Lightstar> ok
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: almost all news in all countries are biased
<GilDash> SirGanjalf: Exactly. XD
<Tovler> BBC is the best source of US News
<MadSurge> Shizuka: that's a better look on religion i,o
<Conyst> Bronysith: good show
<MadSurge> *imo
<Vordox> Shizuka: Sounds good to me, why? I do code. :P
<Colt_Brovakiin> inb4 those kids get brainwashed
<Shizuka> 13you get past the eden story and it turns into "and adam had this many kids, and they had this many kids, and by the way they all lived 800 years each"
*Prince_Lightstar shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: i tried that. it works best if you pretend it's written by Robert Heinlein
<Buytoast> Ah, the Bible, the good book of murder, incest and racism
<GilDash> Tovler: If the BBC says it it must be right. XD
<Jmo> Horrible
<CriticKitten> WAT
<Shizuka> 13the ark is like four lines long
<Vordox> ...wha
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We have Fox (reported right-wing), MSNBC (left-wing), and stuff in-between.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Halo Ween 5
<Dark_Horst> DIE!
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: I did that once...
<Barbetos|AtWork> Master Chieft dresses up as a balerina.
<Prince_Lightstar> i believe in god
<Shizuka> 13got really bored before bed last week so popped it open on kindle... so many pages skipped of family history
<Prince_Lightstar> and god made us
<Bronysith> i really want to leave america as fast as possible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What annoys me is the opinion in news. Opinion should be in saved for opinion columns.
<Queen_Chrysalis> ....
<Colt_Brovakiin> >_(\
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Yep.
<Saturn> 08,01Prince_Lightstar: if he did, he did it through evolution
<Barbetos|AtWork> Bronysith: stop lieing.
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: that's cause of 24/7 news cycles trying to compete with internet's immediacy
<Vordox> <.<
<Bronysith> Barbetos|AtWork: im not lieing,
<Prince_Lightstar> Queen_Chrysalis: IZ A SPAH
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: come live with me in Edinburgh
<Shizuka> 13they have a limited amount of news to report, so fill the rest with reactions
<Prince_Lightstar> Saturn: eyup
<Barbetos|AtWork> Bronysith: Okay.
<Spectrum_Rush> no good can come of this thought train
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: "...And David begot Jeremiah. And Jeremiah begot Jacob. And Jacob begot Aaron..."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the internet's cynicism?
<Barbetos|AtWork> =P
<StinkomanFan> GHOST
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am easy
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Too right. Opinions =/= news. If it's not impartial then something's wrong.
<Dark_Horst> yes, becausem every school can afford electron microscopes
<Bronysith> Saturn: i will, i just need enough money to get there, would you be able to get me a job?
<Jmo> Rawrahah
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: Something like this, right?
<Shizuka> 13SirGanjalf: and the total number of his years were eight hundred and fifty
*Jmo slaps Panda|Homework around a bit with a large trout
<Vordox> Not to be rude here or not...
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: do you have tech skills?
<Saturn> 08,01if you do, then yes
<Buytoast> oh man
<Shizuka> 13and i'm like... wut... i'm pretty sure humans have never managed to live over 200 at best
<Buytoast> his mutasche
<Saturn> 08,01if not, you're on your own
<Buytoast> its like his lip is engorged
<Vordox> But Creationism is an ideal thought, while Evolution is an reality.
<Bronysith> Saturn: :D
<Shizuka> 13dude... your milk mustache is growing
<Vordox> Also, this video MAY grind the stone here on bronystate
<Barbetos|AtWork> Bronysith: Puts your eggs in many MANY baskets. Take it from some one who has been there. NEVER. EVER. Put your faith into one person or thing.
<Panda|Homework> Jmo, yes my love?
<Eli02> fuck. my laptop fried over the creationists crazy talk
<StinkomanFan> That... That stache :b
<Prince_Lightstar> brb
<StinkomanFan> *:B
<thisguy> lmao
<Dken2021> Vordox it certainly has made a dead chat lively
<Prince_Lightstar> well im not brb im not gonna type 4 a bit
<CriticKitten> Okay, kids, which of these sounds more reasonable? a) The world evolved over thousands of years of history, demonstrated with lots of evidence. b) You were made by a god who is everywhere, sees everything, and loves you so much, but can't be detected or measured or quantified and refuses to step in to save the people he loves when awful things happen? :D
<thisguy> i know my brains' frying too
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not convinced that the universe started with a Big Bang
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: Welp, i'm not sure, but i've heard that according to Bible first humans lived about 900 years...
<Vordox> Dken2021: Sensitive subject, while Teller and Penn is VERY biased.
<spud> hi everypony!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: tl;dr
<Saturn> 08,01it may have, but there are other theories too
<thelonepony> hi spud :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai spud :)
<Shizuka> 13yeah adam's something like 950 iirc
<Prince_Lightstar> welcome spud
<Conyst> hello spud
<Barbetos|AtWork> Saturn Big bang is a strange way to spell Pinkie Pie. :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey spud

<Eli02> lol
<Jmo> Howsit Panda|Homework
<Lil_B> Saturn the Problem is that all Calculations brake together at this point and there is litterely no possibility of detecting how it could have been before
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love M theory.
<Colt_Brovakiin> How could that happen in a few days...
<Tovler> The Gish Gallop
<alexxm> noahs partyboat is best boat
<thisguy> lmao pic
<Dark_Horst> SHOW me the fucking kind of water than obliterates stone like that
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: if its creationism vs science, i dont think anyone here wil lchoose creationism, its pretty obvious
<StinkomanFan> Grand Canyon :)
<CriticKitten> Don't take the Grand Canyon for granite, guys.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: "before" is a moot point; time did not exist
<Panda|Homework> I dont think the numbers in the bible were correct. I think it should be reworded to, "They lived a long damn time and no matter what you do now, you will never live that damn long."
<Prince_Lightstar> AHH
<StinkomanFan> ...?
<Prince_Lightstar> chry scared me
<Cypresswolf> but said nay saying scientists never bothered to build a similar ark to test if it could be done
<Panda|Homework> Jmo research....
<Shizuka> 13oh also, if you actually read the passages, the great flood is god going "dammit, these humans are all evil, FUCK IT I'M STARTING OVER, YOU THERE GET SOME ANIMALS AND NOT DIE, THE REST OF YOU CAN DROWN"
<spud> so what is this?
<Jmo> :<
<Jmo> nofun
<Dken2021> only thousands?
<Lil_B> Saturn yeah, that's what I ment, but I didn't know how else to discribe it :/
<MadSurge> Shizuka: eeeyup
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, yep.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: But, he's a wonderful nice god who loves everyone!
<thisguy> can we watch something else now? all this talk about creationism is getting to us >.<
<CriticKitten> D:
<SirGanjalf> I love the M theory too(though i understand nothing of it:D)
<StinkomanFan> I can see that Shizuka.
<Eli02> sometimes i ask myself if they really belive that shit, or if it's just about the money
<Vordox> Shizuka: As said, I'd rather trust Satan, who killed 5-6 people, while God killed countless millions.
<Panda|Homework> Shizuka, yup.
<Prince_Lightstar> :>
<Colt_Brovakiin> True facts that jesus rode a velociraptor into war...
<Dken2021> In other words, God was formatting his harddrive
<Chrysalis> see i quite like that people will argue but evolution is just a theory
<Panda|Homework> Vordox, thats a good point...
<Chrysalis> gives me hope
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli02: religion has often been about money and power throughout history
<Meanwhile> Chinese Jesus is the best Jesus.
<Alchemist> Shizuka: http://derpy.me/2LvOx
<Prince_Lightstar> ;):):P:$
<Panda|Homework> Ok.... WHY ARE WE ON RELIGION?
<Chrysalis> that maybe theyll think the same about the theory of gravity
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: power mostly
<Chrysalis> and theyll float the buck away
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: still is
<Shizuka> 13later the sodom and gomorrah thing... just confused me... okay so here's a couple cities that are pretty corrupt, you there take your wife and kids and leave imma firebomb the place
<MadSurge> Shizuka: and then he's like "I'll make the rainbow to remember I already destroyed civilization once"
<weeping_pegasi82> yay science...
<Shizuka> 13oh but if you turn and look back at the awesome sight of fire from the sky i'll turn you to salt
<Prince_Lightstar> i wanna play tf2
<SirGanjalf> NO SHIT
<CriticKitten> But he's an all-loving god!
<Shizuka> 13just so much wut
<Buytoast> don't forget the incest Shizuka
<Eli02> Alchemist: that's scienc
<Tovler> so, he's just sayin though
<StinkomanFan> Humanity itself is disproof of Natural Selection :|
<Buytoast> can't have the bible without incest
<Lil_B> Vordox I once saw a short Comix where Celestia sent everybody that annoyed her to the moon, which resulted in a Moontopolis and only one Pony left on eEarth... I donÄ't know the reselblence with this here, but I feel that there is some
<Shizuka> 13i was last in sunday school when i was like four but.. i remember the whole "lot's wife was turned to salt" being a bigger deal than the single line in the actual book it is
<Eli02> Alchemist: also: your name shows you're TOTALLY a creationist

<Panda|Homework> Shizuka, i always looked at the stories in the bible as parables and never took them at the surface. I think its just meant to convery a message and not to be taken literal. none the less it is still.... wat.
<Dken2021> Prince_Lightstar becuase someone started talking about peta and it eventually led up to here

<Panda|Homework> Saturn, what about Wrek cosplaying as Nittany cosplaying as Shizuka?
<Prince_Lightstar> TELLER HAS A GUN IN BIBLE
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: you, wrek, and Nittany_Discord. in maid outfits.
<Eli02> hey hey, the world is flat. believe me
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: so creationism will be taught as a part of biology?
<GilDash> Panda|Homework: Cosplayception?
<Conyst> Anyone want to come with me?
<Bronysith> Saturn: as long as you supply them...or buy me 3 plushies
<Colt_Brovakiin> haha GilDash :P how about mars, Curiosity said it was ok there

<thisguy> i'm not saying it may be aliens, but....
<thisguy> it may be aliens
<StinkomanFan> IT'S THE ALIEN FROM THIS iSLAND EARTH! :O
<CriticKitten> I demand that pastafarianism be taught in schools.
<Conyst> To Mars we go.
<Colt_Brovakiin> yay!
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: why? the truth must be spread
<spud> ಠ▃ಠ
<thisguy> yay its over

<thisguy> DBZ ABRIDGED :)
<Conyst> Do end of the world.
<Dark_Horst> do we have more bullshit?
<Pink3> No mOre of theese please,i highly disagreed with this one :)\
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I wouldn't expect that. But evolution is an unprovable theory. Teaching that as fact in biology class is no better.
<Prince_Lightstar> t(ಠ_ಠt) meggage to the aleins
<Shizuka> 13has anyone read origin of species? not sure if it's dense or actually an enjoyable read
<Alchemist> back to writing my report...
<Colt_Brovakiin> yay!
<Eli02> we wish
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli02: i was troll-proving to everyone that the earth was flat, nobody could come up with counter-arguments, twas funny
<Rommulus> It is interesting so yay
<Panda|Homework> Shizuka little bit of both, that book it.
<Bronysith> Saturn: so yea, buy me 3 plushies and a maid outfit and ill take a pic of myself in the maid outfit...
<alexxm> one more episode i like this show
<Panda|Homework> is*
<GilDash> Wrek: Go for it. This stuff's great.
<StinkomanFan> Do it Wrek!
<CriticKitten> No, really. If we're going to be fair, we should present ALL theories that explain life on earth, even the absurd.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: http://i.imgur.com/01NSl.jpg
<thelonepony> If you want to Wrek ...
<MadSurge> Wrek: Penn and Teller are pleasant people and they do good programs :)
<CriticKitten> Scientology? Pastafarianism? Let them in too!
<Eli02> they didn't come up with angles, poles, magnetic fields and all that?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: well if its not part of a biology class and its optional, then might as well let them teach it, who cares
<thisguy> weeeee
<Shizuka> 13i vaguely remember reading somewhere that darwin posited that evolution was the method by which god creates life, rather than POOF instant life everywhere
<Prince_Lightstar> THE WORLD ISNT FLAT U GO ONE WAY AROUND THE WORLD U BE BAK WHERE U CAME FROM
<spud> ಠ_ರೃ
<Bronysith> Shizuka: do you just want pics of winter asuka or asuka in general?
<SirGanjalf> CriticKitten: And we should teach Alchemy, if we teach Chemistry
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: have you read The Selfish Gene? i'm really not a fan of Dawkins' verbose writing style
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: i have all eight seasons here if you want me to run some
<thisguy> lets put ponies to cheer us up
<MadSurge> Shizuka: that's a good theory.
<thisguy> something pony related :P
<Prince_Lightstar> there u got cho comebak :3
<Mutterguy> Saturn i have
<Lil_B> I'
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli02: i was saying that it was flat but not without limits, i think that doesnt deny the poles
<Rommulus> Careful thisguy they may put 3rd gen up
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, if it's in an elective class and all positions of the origin of life are presented, well, I can certainly tell you that the Atheists will throw a MASSIVE fit over it.
<Panda|Homework> Saturn, ill look it up now.
<Bronysith> Mermaid Asuka?
<Lil_B> I'm off now, bye everyone :)
<Shizuka> 13and reading this youcat thing, that seems to be the church's position too, evolution describes the mechanism by which life pops up, religion gives a metaphysical reason for the mechanism
<Rommulus> Bye Lil_B
<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodbye Lil_B :)
<alexxm> bye Lil_B
<thisguy> dat cursor
<Prince_Lightstar> wow
<thelonepony> Bye Lil_B ")
<thelonepony> :)*
<Conyst> see ya Lil_B
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye Lil_B
<Prince_Lightstar> TELLER IZ EPIC
<CriticKitten> SirGanjalf: True! After all, why should Chemistry get all the emphasis? Let's teach kids how to turn things into gold. Their final exam can be them turning something into gold, and everyone will fail. :D
*Saturn 08,01wishes he had someone to go to bed with
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah but thats their problem, they should accept it
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Bye, Lil_B. :)
<thisguy> bye Lil_B :)
<spud> yay swearing!
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: i think the single argument, that when you walk once around you end up at the same place nullifies all
<Prince_Lightstar> teller
<Saturn> 08,01i'm lonely
<Pink3> NU
<Prince_Lightstar> iz scared
<thelonepony> Saturn: Me too :(

<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I don't think I can emphasize the MASSIVE enough without violating the rule against non-mods using control codes.
<Bronysith> Saturn: me too
<Colt_Brovakiin> yay!
<Prince_Lightstar> :D
<thisguy> yay more bullshit :)
<Conyst> hugs Lil_B
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli02: ah, but my punchline was that you just walk arond the angles :D
<Tovler> It makes me sad that the later seasons have nudity and can't be streamed here.
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: more casual, the usual art of asuka being flirty or angry doesn't really appeal
<ASoftFluffyThing> I FUCKING R FUCKING S
<Eli02> ... seems legit twilight_sprinkle
<thisguy> video games :P
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I have no winter Asuka, but I found something: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/b44ebfcd505640dd0c79b97a363eb66b.jpg
<Nerom> Good evening everyone how are ya this lovely night

<spud> damn it messed up
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Meanwhile> Man, NGE was the worst thing I've seen in a long time.

<Bronysith> Shizuka: oh right
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *:)
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: eh im just saying that if they really want to teach it, they should be allowed, it should just be a choice and atheists should accept it
<Eli02> now you all love that show. until they make one on bronies
<thelonepony> Bye ASoftFluffyThing|AFK :)
<Shizuka> 13this is like season 7 i think, they seem to have more nudity that season
<Cypresswolf> Oh the rant I could spew on the IRS :)
<alexxm> i want to see what the titty tax is about is steve austin in charge of it
<Conyst> later ASoftFluffyThing|AFK
<twilight_sprinkle> Prince_Lightstar: not a fail, he turned off notations
<Wrek> 05twilight_sprinkle: and im saying that i want to teach people how to put babies on spikes

<Wrek> 05and i should be allowed to
<thisguy> lmao
<Prince_Lightstar> THE I BUCKING R BUCKING S
<SirGanjalf> :D
<thisguy> dat editing
*Shizuka 13casts summon greater ronulan
<Prince_Lightstar> watche teller
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: thats offensive though, i dont see how creationism is offensive. its annoying, but id just ignore them
<TheMaster> hah. ponies up
<SirGanjalf> dat pun
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: oh, selfish gene is on there, think i'll look into that
<Cypresswolf> I wonder how many tax cheats our congress has now
<Kandarihu> The atheists went to outright war against that because the Intelligent Design theory at least creates a shred of doubt in macroevolution and is therefore no different than forcing atheists to convert to Christianity at gunpoint.
<Eli02> how many % did he say?
<Nerom> Wrek you have a sick mind....
<Kandarihu> And they won
<thisguy> 40 :\
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Offensiveness is a matter of perspective.
<Wrek> 05old news Nerom
<Prince_Lightstar> :D
<TheMaster> there isn't any doubt in evolution. Intelligent design is nothing new
<Wrek> 05offensive is in the eye of the beholder
<Nerom> I know Wrek I know
<Prince_Lightstar> THE IRS TOOK TELLER
<Bronysith> dat seducing Kaworu
<Nerom> Just stating facts
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: yeah but creationism isnt normally offensive, its offensive only if you really want it to be
<TheMaster> its offensive because its attacking the foundation of science by pretending theres anything opinionated about it.
<Prince_Lightstar> POOR TELLER
<Prince_Lightstar> :O
<Conyst> I knew it.
<Prince_Lightstar> TIME MACHINE
<StinkomanFan> :o
<thisguy> 4 score and 7 years ago.......
<StinkomanFan> DOCTOR WHOOVES
<SirGanjalf> Teller is the Doctor:O
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: I don't find it offensive in and of itself. I find it offensive that it can be used to lable evolution as false, when all the evidence proves just the opposite.
<alexxm> suddenly time travel
<Conyst> Does it say OUTATIME?
<alexxm> why are they cosplaying
<Prince_Lightstar> past=1 obama=0
<Colt_Brovakiin> ma tea!
<thisguy> i had a dream......
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: well i wouldnt teach it by saying evolution is false, id jsut say "this is another way to look at things"
<TheMaster> Theres already a insitution that spends all its time talking about intelligent design. Its called a church. Why does a school need to have time for that too?
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Shizuka> 13reading up on the actual acts, they were exactly as bad as everyone makes them out to be
<thisguy> i dont think he'd like the future :\
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01[17:51:20]	Bronysith	Saturn: so yea, buy me 3 plushies and a maid outfit and ill take a pic of myself in the maid outfit... <- This I have to see.
<StinkomanFan> OH WAIT
<Shizuka> 13stamp act in particular was a take that at the colonists
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: I suppose you could say it's the people, not the theory, that I find offensive.
<Prince_Lightstar> DO THE SHUFFLE
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: but they are teaching lies to our kids
*Prince_Lightstar does shuffle
<Bronysith> Saturn: do you want to see me in a maid outfit or not?
<Mutterguy> Sorrry our King at the time was insane :(
<Bronysith> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54493344/bricks.png when you see it, you will shit bricks
<Prince_Lightstar> applejack`: r u a spy
<thisguy> if i play a f2p game, will the take some of that too? :\
<TheMaster> do you know how a theory works? Intelligent design only reaches step one of the scientific method. Which is 'form hypothesis'. Which is "I think something intelligent made the universe" theres no evidence, no test, no way to prove such a statement. Its -not- science. not even a little and has no place in a science classroom.
<CCCP> Hi!
<Nerom> I just remembered how much I missed reading this chat.
<thelonepony> Hi CCCP :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli02: like i said, its more of a secondary view on things than forcing lies on peoples' thinking. yeah i wouldnt want my kids studying it, but imo if people really want to, then might as well let them
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i really do
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: skype? :P
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, well churches are more about helping people who have a spiritual relationship with the aforementioned creator become even closer.
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai CCCP :)
<Conyst> Hire all the giants.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: not flirty, not angry... not sure if casual... http://fav.me/d5h9y7y
<alexxm> why do they have so many giants
<thisguy> hey, who doesnt love giants? you know, fee fi fo fum
<Bronysith> Saturn: i dont have the maid outfit man,
<Prince_Lightstar> im gone
<CCCP> Hi thelonepony and Colt_Brovakiin
<Prince_Lightstar> BAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
<Bronysith> Saturn: supply it for me AND get me 3 plushies
<Conyst> hello CCCP
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: how about i just buy you a maid outfit?
<Shizuka> 13not bad
<alexxm> how've things been CCCP
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: no. because it's clearly NOT true.
<Bronysith> Saturn: maid outfit, AND 3 plushies
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: can they be any plushies?
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: but i get what you say
<TheMaster> It needs to be more than 'possibly true' you need actual evidence
<Bronysith> Saturn: pony plushies via your connection
<Bronysith> and i get to pic em out
<CCCP> Hi Conyst and alexxm good!
<Kandarihu> Teaching Macro Evolution is, in essence, compelling Christians to convert to Atheism.
<TheMaster> an intelligent designer is just as likely to be a flying spaghetti monster as yahweh.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli02: im not familiar with details of creationism, but it seems they have their own weird logic that is just based on a superbeing. from what i can tell, its not impossible that theyre wrong
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: i think if i was smart enough to get away from religions, others can do the same
<spud> like a sir ಠ_ರೃ
<StinkomanFan> BABBIES
<Bronysith> Saturn: from bitterxtea plushies
<Colt_Brovakiin> CCCP: Glad to hear you are feeling better :)
<Shizuka> 13and then there's scientology~
<TheMaster> It doesn't force anyone to convert to anything. Its your own problem if you have a crisis of facts vs. faith. Evolution isn't up for opinion, its demonstratable fact.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, have you considered the possibility that they're right?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli02: yeah i wouldnt recommend everyone to take it, but i wouldnt force anyone not to
<Conyst> And once everyone is the government no one is.
<Shizuka> 13huffpo is huuuuuugely leftwing and they know it
<Cypresswolf> By all means, comply and pay your taxes - the other alternative doesnt end well for anyone
<MadSurge> Dat grin
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, has it been observed?
<killerpony7733> Haha denmark
<Eli02> twilight_sprinkle: i have nothing against believers. just religions
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think Bronysith should be the new Bronystate maid. He's more maid-crazy than I ever was.
<Shizuka> 13^
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: maybe
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^^
<StinkomanFan> GOING ON AND ON AND OOOOOOON
<Jmo> The horror.
<CCCP> Colt_Brovakiin :)
<Conyst> No toxins. Riiiight.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: You really want to give up that post?
<TheMaster> Yes. Bananas, sickle cell anemia, whales with hipbones, chimps having 97% dna similarity. Nylon eating bacteria (for a material that didn't exist until the 1970s) I can go on
<Nerom> Still there is more toxins in amerikan food than most countries
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't hold it anymore.
<Vivix> Evolution has been observed
<thisguy> too poor?
<Vivix> but that doesn't mean that christians should stop believeing
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Well, just make sure to hang that maid outfit of yours up safely. :D
<Jmo> SANTA ISN'T REAL
<thisguy> lmao
<TheMaster> They made ecoli eat a material that it has never been observed to eat before.
<StinkomanFan> SCREW YOU RICH BASTARDS :|
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i cant prove they are wrong, i lack the knowledge of the theory to do so. if its based on the fact that theres a superbeing, well, as ridiculous as it seems, i cant prove it impossible, onlyabsolutely unlikely
<Vivix> FUK U JMO! FUK U
<Meanwhile> I like that logic.
<Eli02> what?
<Jmo> AHAHA
<TheMaster> They forced evolution on ecoli germs, proving evolution.
<Eli02> now this show fucks up
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: i think Saturn is being serious with giving me this maid outfit
<Bronysith> holy fuck
<Eli02> that tax would actually make sense
*Spectrum_Rush wants pie now
<Saturn> 08,01i want pie.
<CriticKitten> I'm not taking Gondor from you, I'm giving Gondor to me
<Conyst> He just wants pie.
<Alchemist> pai
<Mutterguy> In NZ there was considerations of dropping GST(equivlent to VAT) on fruit veggies and meat but nothing happened because the governement said it'd make things too complicated.
<Saturn> 08,01where was Gondor when there was no pie?
<Bronysith> HAAHHA
<MadSurge> Poor Teller :D
<thisguy> i'd like pumpin pie :)
<spud> pie
<Eli02> are these two rich?

<DashWithRainbows> Joomay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh well Bronysith.
<Nerom> And now everyone want pie
<DashWithRainbows> go to bed
<DashWithRainbows> >:l
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: this will be fun
<TheMaster> there, they taught ecoli how to eat a new substance
<Jmo> Soon DWR
<Eli02> because they don't seem to wanna pay rich taxes
<alexxm> i want pie
<Jmo> It's only 6AM
<Colt_Brovakiin> all dem pie
<MadSurge> Eli02: they're Las Vegas magicians, so I assume yes
<TheMaster> Oh hey its ron paul!

<spud> pm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope your family is OK with that.
<thisguy> he's say "you shall not taaaaaax"
<TheMaster> taxing a church is a bad idea. It gives churches even more of a say in government.
<CCCP> Hi killer
<TheMaster> since they'd want a say in those taxes
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, so did the e-coli bacteria produce something distinctly different from e-coli? Or is it just a new varient of e-coli?
<Cypresswolf> Gandalf would lead the rebellion :3
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: I've missed that
<killerpony7733> CCCP Oi
<StinkomanFan> BUNNY
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Not anymore. :3
<CCCP> Hai Meanwhile :3
<TheMaster> But sometime around the 31,500th generation, something dramatic happened in just one of the populations - the bacteria suddenly acquired the ability to metabolise citrate, a second nutrient in their culture medium that E. coli normally cannot use.

<Spectrum_Rush> curse you Bronysith ya ninja my next post
<Shizuka> 13mari is just there for the fanservice and to fuzz up the plot development
<Vordox> <---- That Bullshit
<Vordox> Shizuka: Sounds good. :P
<StinkomanFan> :O
<Bronysith> Shizuka: you see the pirate asuka?
<killerpony7733> No surprise
<Vordox> <--- A MAN WITH BRAIN

<Vordox> RON PAUL!
<Vordox> <3
<MadSurge> Gandalf :D
<Alchemist> dick army? did he change his name from penis squadron?
<TheMaster> The man who could never be president.
<TheMaster> sadly
<MakerDusk> I almost got robbed right in front of my door
<Vordox> TheMaster: By alot of cheats.
<Saturn> 08,01i love that Rob Zimmerman line
<Jmo> o.O
<MakerDusk> "what are you going to do, call the cops?"
<killerpony7733> MakerDusk Ouch how so?
<Saturn> 08,01"are people born gay, or do they turn gay just to piss off Dick Armey?"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wish Paul was Republican Candidate.
<StinkomanFan> AL CAPONE <3
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Do you remember the question for next week's P3 show?
*MakerDusk opens door, german sheppard charged would be robbers
<MadSurge> :D
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: I hoped for ROn Paul to go President.
<Vordox> Why?
<Kandarihu> If there's one concern about a Ron Paul presidency, it's that he's the center of a personality cult.
<MakerDusk> and that I why I have a dog >_<
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: you do realize that they only let retards into politics right? thats why Paul could never be president
<spud> http://images.wikia.com/central/images/8/87/74719_-_artist-dazko_costume_derpy_hooves.png
<MadSurge> That man is strong :D
<MakerDusk> killerpony7733: drunk natives

<killerpony7733> MakerDusk Well thank god. Would be really bad if you did get robbed
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i saw u avoid dat... p3 is gigabits podcast?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: i found another asuka pic...too flirty though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We need more people voting.
<GilDash> MakerDusk: My dog would wander up to them and demand their love and affection. He's totally useless. XD
<Spectrum_Rush> http://fav.me/d36e0y0 winter Shizuka :3
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Yep. Avoid what?
<MakerDusk> GilDash: mine's a suck up, but they sense tensions really easily
<CCCP> Beep boop
<donutpop365> Hey everypony.

<donutpop365> Hi AJIsAwesome.
<Shizuka> 13Spectrum_Rush: i think that guy scanned it but i have that one :3
<Colt_Brovakiin> But I want ma tea! ;~;
<thelonepony> Hi donutpop365 :)
<thisguy> we're watching bullshit. wanna join?
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: people not voting and then complaining about the government make me REALLY mad.
<Conyst> hello Dark92Enigma
<donutpop365> Hi thelonepony
<GilDash> MakerDusk: He runs away from cats... XD
<donutpop365> .
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, donutpop365. :)
<CCCP> Hi donutpony365
<Tovler> slaves should be tax-free!
<thelonepony> wb Dark92Enigma What is it?
<MakerDusk> nothing like being charged by ruff up, fang barred, barking german sheppard
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai donutpop365
<Kandarihu> He'd still be better than Obama, who not only has a personality cult but special protection from hate crimes, which his personality cult spared no expense in overplaying.
<donutpop365> Hai Colt_Brovakiin.
<Conyst> hello donutpop365
<alexxm> what happened Dark92Enigma
<Vordox> MakerDusk: Last I checked, the world vote had Ron Paul above 22k Votes, about 70% of all votes on World Vote. :P
<donutpop365> Hi Conyst.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i asked y u no check chat like i told u, as for the question, i think it was what kind of pony merc would you like to have, rexisting or non-
<Shizuka> 13lul they are actually running from the camera
<donutpop365> Everypony's just gonna keep on sayin' hai so I have to reply eh? :P
<donutpop365> Oh and no I'm not Canadian xD
<donutpop365> I'm MINNESOTAN AWW YEAH!
<SirGanjalf> :D
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Okay. I checked chat, my client's just not loading the messages.
<thisguy> 6_9
<Conyst> Should've sent a gnome
<Vordox> Dick army...
<Vordox> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: are you using web client?
<Vordox> That's USA name
<Dark92Enigma> The thing is, tommorrow i'll travel to Iquique for a vacation trip......so i'll be here for a shorter period of time, and even less often
<CCCP> What's streaming?
<Dark92Enigma> PENN AND TELLER!?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i mean page
<CriticKitten> It amuses me that Ron Paul was one of the few willing to admit the tax code is shit, given that he's one of the few sane voices in the government....think about THAT. :P
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Yes.
<donutpop365> MEA?
<thisguy> we're watching bullshit :P
<StinkomanFan> Thank you Dick :)
<CCCP> Bye pony_155012
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP: Penn and Teller : BULLS**t
<Kandarihu> If Ron Paul got the GOP nomination, it would be one personality cult vs another personality cult.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: As said, Ron Paul, although a bit of a extreme changer, had a brain,
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: you tried scrolling up and it still didnt load anything?
<Shizuka> 13donutpop365: woo fellow minnesotan
<TheMaster> though Ron Pauls cult is a tiny bit smaller
<Shizuka> 13freezing yet?
<donutpop365> Dark92Enigma: MEA?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: He predicted SEVERAL issues that would burst the economy, even back in the 80s.
<MakerDusk> donutpop365: I used to live in Fort Frances, Ontario, so I know exactly where you live :p
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma wish I could see it.
<TheMaster> he's too libertarian, sadly.
<Jmo> egh
<Bronysith> http://dash.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133546243038.jpg
<MakerDusk> you Minneapolis dweller :p
<Shizuka> 13who
*Tovler hates this election circus.
<donutpop365> Shizuka: woo? LOUDER!!!
<CriticKitten> Aye. I don't like all of Paul's ideas but I respect the guy's clear knowledge and foresight of the situation we're in. >_>
<Vordox> Tovler: Revise your system, make it a democracy :P
<StinkomanFan> Mom and Dad :)
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: alexxm thelonepony Consty have you read my announcement?
<Kandarihu> Mitt Romney doesn't have a personality cult at all. The people who are supporting him values the welfare of the country first over the popularity of their hero in the history books.
<Tovler> Vordox: ok. Just give me about 3 hours.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: His Gold standard is a risk, but HUGE rewards can be done. And his Foreign Policy is the smartest I ever heard.
<thelonepony> Dark92Enigma: Yes
<Colt_Brovakiin> haha
<alexxm> yep Dark92Enigma
<MakerDusk> lol, Shizuka and donutpop365 live in the same city >_<
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Which one?
<TheMaster> its not like taxes arnt lower than they've ever been. The issue is that the corporations are so joined with government. Taxes are far from the worst thing government can do.
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: in fact quite the opposite, could argue romney has a sort of anti-personality-cult given all the bickering leading up to the nomination
<MakerDusk> inb4 they meet up >_<
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: trying to scroll up usually lets me check if chat is dead
<CriticKitten> I think the gold standard idea is bound to bust. Too little too late. But the foreign policy is actually extremely intelligent.
<thelonepony> I hope You come back soon from your trip Dark92Enigma :)
<Shizuka> 13so many people jumping ship because perry didn't make it
<cachi01> hi everypony :) uhmmm what is this???? DONT SAY SPARTA OR PATRICK
<CCCP> Hi Cameh_Dude

<Colt_Brovakiin> hey cachi01, patrick
<Wrek> 05when a goverment run and or owned organization goes with profit, something is wrong.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Just people being too dumb to not listen :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is sad when the only good choice for the country is an asshole.
<Colt_Brovakiin> :3
<Shizuka> 13MakerDusk: i'm well north of minneapolis, there's like two more comcast nodes between me and the hub there
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: spartan patrick
<Tovler> Jon Huntsman was the only reasonable one.
<Dark92Enigma> So i'll be here in a less often basis......i'll try to watch this week's movies
<Conyst> hello cachi01
<Cameh_Dude> thanks thelonepony! xD
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: oh god u have filled my mind with ugly images lol
*CCCP nomz twilight_sprinkle

<Vordox> Who is streaming?
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: not as bad as not having a choice at all, like in many other countries

<Tovler> o come on!
<twilight_sprinkle> denied
<SirGanjalf> America~!
<CCCzP> Bye everyone*
<Kandarihu> Now that I think about it, the fandom of Ron Paul is purely ideological. Supposing he were to become president, and his fans were to become more like enforcers, and he ends up making a mistake. Will his fans forgive everything?
<Vordox> Who is streaming?
<Meanwhile> Wait what? Directed by Star Price?
<thelonepony> when will you be leaving Dark92Enigma ?
<Shizuka> 13MakerDusk: can't drive
<Spectrum_Rush> thats not how it happened
<Vordox> I got a video for the person :P

<Vordox> Saturn: Actually, more then boobs:P
<Jmo> all of my nop.
<SirGanjalf> nuuu
<TheMaster> Ron Paul would just be totally powerless as president. He'd have no political support whatsoever and just fight eveyrone in government all the time. But he'd enjoy that, actually, and it would make for interesting watching.
<cachi01> SLENDAMAAAAN
<Meanwhile> 'Lo TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<Dark92Enigma> BIGFOOT EPISODE PLEASE
<Rommulus> Hooray
<donutpop365> I'm with Nittany_Discord on this one.

<Pink3> Slenderman,dressed in darkest suit and tie,slenderman you will certainly die
<thelonepony> Dark92Enigma: I wont be here atm
<Rommulus> This is just like the start of watching mlp, just one more episode
<Saturn> 08,01i'll just have to show *double* the penis on my stream, then.
<Pink3> Slenderman
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> do you like puzzle games Meanwhile ?
<Chrysalis> Saturn you will have your bewbs and be happy
<Vordox> Saturn: O.o
<Dark92Enigma> OK then......
<Jmo> oh god no
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not everyone in chat is bi- or pan-. Sorry.
<Meanwhile> Shizu why're people spamming you with pictures of that one jerk from NGE?
<CriticKitten> TheMaster: Actually....it depends how the whole thing works out.
<cachi01> the tallest man the darkest suit
*Dark92Enigma hugs thelonepony again
<GilDash> Saturn: Go right ahead. XD
<Vordox> Saturn: The cause of why they had nudity, is to show a point. :P
<cachi01> Saturn: wuuuuuuuut .-.
<SirGanjalf> GMO?
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: not everyone in chat appreciates boobs
<Tovler> mm, organic food
<thelonepony> I'll miss you Dark92Enigma ;3;
<Shizuka> 13because asuka is best pony
<TheMaster> Well it won't ever happen, we'll keep getting corporate friendly statists as president.
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, Mitt Romney as president would be getting a massive earful from the very people who will have voted for him. Myself included.
<cachi01> Saturn: i appreciate bewbz :3
<Meanwhile> Not really.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Oh you are streaming? >.>
<thisguy> woot :)
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: There may be straight women here as well, ignoring the rules of the internet.
<SirGanjalf> eeyup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. Wrek is Vordox.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Ah, great! Thanks. :)
<Dark_Horst> okay, who in here does not appreciate boobs?
<Dark92Enigma> he ate it :D
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: How about this one? http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=neon+genesis+evangelion+asuka&offset=264#/d49t3h9 :3
<TheMaster> as though Mitt Romney is going to listen to 'the people'. The republicans only pander to two bases. The christian right wing and the corporate elite.
<thisguy> eff that, genetic mods for life
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh well i'll keep looking
<Dark92Enigma> Nittany_Discord: they're the same person?
<TheMaster> So unless you're a right wing evangelical or a CEO, fat chance a mitt romney presidency will care what you do
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord do you like puzzle games ?
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Vordox> Maneur XD

<StinkomanFan> We need to see that Apocolypse one too.
<donutpop365> xD
<StinkomanFan> Mmmmm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And me on a diet.
<cachi01> you know whats bullshit? grass
<Dark92Enigma> I'm hungry all of a sudden
<GilDash> This is where a dirty mind doesn't help. XD
<Saturn> 08,01i can name a few things i'd like stuffed in my mouth.
<GilDash> ^
<Meanwhile> Please don't.
<TheMaster> theres nothing to finish. Iraq was the worst idea and undertaking our government has probably ever done. Even Vietnam was more logical
<GilDash> Proving my point. XD
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: agrees with me
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Like lasagna? :P
<cachi01> Saturn what r u doin...... Saturn STAHP
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01: AVGN for the f***ing win
<Tovler> lawns are Bullshit. They should do episode on that.
<TheMaster> theres nothing we could do to 'fix it' beyond killing every iraqi man, woman and child
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: lasagne is food
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<thisguy> inorganic for life /)
<donutpop365> I love lasagne lol.
<Vordox> TheMaster: How about..."Ignoring" that country?
<donutpop365> (VIDEO Reference).
<SirGanjalf> hippies!
<Dark_Horst> ...they look so fucking hippie
<StinkomanFan> mmmmmmmmmmmLasanga
<donutpop365> Anyone catch that?
<alexxm> kill the hippies
<cachi01> dat pregnancy
<Shizuka> 13that baby's going to grow up craving mcdonalds
<CriticKitten> "Organic food"
<Dark_Horst> they couldnt jsut possibly find a way to look more cliche
<CriticKitten> So, crap/
<Chrysalis> i dont like them already
<CriticKitten> *.
<donutpop365> NOPONY caught the lasagna reference?
<thisguy> forget organic. geth for life /)
<Meanwhile> Those people have probably eaten so much manure.
<Tovler> Well, Wind and Solar is not an option here. We've got to get oil somewhere.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A bit.
<cachi01> FAKIN HIPPIES
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01'sup?
<CriticKitten> You know what else would bring you closer to nature?
<Dark92Enigma> donutpop365: Garfield reference?
<Meanwhile> Woah dude, carrots.
<AJIsAwesome> Uggh, never knew why I liked McDonald's as a kid. The food makes me sick whenever I eat it.
<CriticKitten> Go live in the fucking forest.
<GilDash> There's a reason we don't rely on nature... it's called efficiency.
<Dark_Horst> thisguy: this notion is legion-approved
<Mega_Milk> Meanwhile: Oh ma gerd!
<Alchemist> is that fucking lipstic she's wearing organic too? bitch...
<Vordox> If YOU people are talking BAD about these people.
<Chrysalis> that girl needs to get out
<Vordox> You deserve to be slapped
<Shizuka> 13Dark92Enigma: whoa whoa whoa i'm getting a feeling here, are you aware of garfield?
<Chrysalis> seriously
<Mega_Milk> Meanwhile: Your back! ;^;
<TheMaster> you can ignore it, thats fine. We did sort of screw it all up though. A shiite friendly iraqi dictatorship rather then a secular sunni dictatorship. Great job for 5000 dead soldiers, a million dead iraqis, 700 billion dollars and the permanent damage done to the u.s.' reputation
<Saturn> 08,01now, i'm a proud hippie
*cachi01 slaps Vordox
<donutpop365> Dark92Enigma: Nope.
<Meanwhile> Mega_Milk: You're*
<twilight_sprinkle> i love how they always look for the most extre extremeists they can find
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, the whole Iraqi nuclear weapons program was Saddam Hussein's bluff to stop Iran from invading them. Indeed it would've been better if we believed him on that, and just pretend to not believe him.
<Saturn> 08,01but there's such a thing as too far
<Mega_Milk> Meanwhile: I love you man....
<Jmo> Ahahaha nazi'd

<Dark_Horst> Saturn: dont these two airheads just emberass you? i'd be
<cachi01> BEST
<Nerom> Is not all yarn organic?
<cachi01> NAME
<Kandarihu> Er, believed when he said that he didn't have nukes.

<Vordox> IF You people talk BAD about this people... STOP BEING JUDGEMENTAL, one of the worst THINGS you ever could do
<Tovler> :( I missed Cloverfield riff and last week's lottery

<Chrysalis> fuckin tes
<SirGanjalf> Jesus
<cachi01> dat last dinner
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, he did some stuff to indicate that there was a nuclear weapons program that was already in an advanced stage.
<donutpop365> What was that?
<Chrysalis> fuckin science

<AJIsAwesome> YourLittleDashie: Best of luck! :)
<Vordox> THERE WAS NO WOMEN BACK IN JESUS TIME
<donutpop365> Nice beard...
<thelonepony> Why don't you drink tea with honey to help that sore throat
<SirGanjalf> dat John
<cachi01> JESUS! YOU....you look different?
<Dark92Enigma> i've even added some Nostalgia Critic references in the riff last night
<donutpop365> Cowboy disciple...
<CriticKitten> Better Taste! Less Filling!
<Cameh_Dude> dundundun
<Chrysalis> dat taste
<Kandarihu> The Clinton Administration fell for the ruse too but (fortunately) wasn't able to do anything about it.
<Eli> is that a midget`?
<Slater> I had organic cotton candy before and it was horrible.
<YourLittleDashie> AJIsAwesome: Well, If I have a sore throat, I cannot sing
<Dark92Enigma> PENN & TELLER....so irreverent they're awesome
<Vordox> Err..
<Vordox> That's wrong.
<thelonepony> Why don't you drink tea with honey to help that sore throat YourLittleDashie ?
<thisguy> organic cotton candy?
<Mega_Milk> Suddenly I want a cheese burger...
<Shizuka> 13lady, you can inject nutrients into a food
<CriticKitten> Um, because I'm stupid :D
<thisguy> sounds like something discord would think up
<Slater> thisguy: Yes
<Dark_Horst> bitch, there is a REASON why people grow bigger fucking vegetables than they find in fucking nature
<Meanwhile> The most natural thing she looks like she's been taking comes in a bong.
<AJIsAwesome> YourLittleDashie: Technically you can, just not very well. :S
<GilDash> Nah... nutrients are pumped in.
<cachi01> organic products contain proteins because they are closer to nature.............uhmmm what
<Eli> it's not more nutricous. it's just less unhealthy
<YourLittleDashie> thelonepony: I did, I'm numbing my throat to oblivion!
<AJIsAwesome> *:P
<twilight_sprinkle> ah, finding the most extreme extremists works every time
<Chrysalis> he is an idiot
<TheMaster> how are farm produced foods not organic?
<Cameh_Dude> cachi01 ikr? xD
<GilDash> They did it with ration packs for fuck sake.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Welcome to entertainment
<Chrysalis> there would not be enough food
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: im fine with it as long as they dont try to make it seem legit
<donutpop365> Be right back.
<thelonepony> oh, well i hope you get better YourLittleDashie :D
<Kandarihu> Before the 9/11 attacks, we had foreign policy based on the idea that if we don't start wars, nobody will attack us. Then the WTC was destroyed. That was the end of the optimism.
<Meanwhile> Wait what?
<thelonepony> :)*
<Alchemist> did these people hear about protein shakes?
<thisguy> 6_9
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: but unfortunately thats what this show tries to do
<SirGanjalf> :D
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Mega_Milk> How old is he???

<Metronome> 107 !!!!!!!I am so eating organic food!!!!!!
<Nerom> cachi01: ARE YOU jESUS?

<Dark92Enigma> 107 years old!?????
<TheMaster> if the foods exposed to pesticides were dangerous they WOULDN'T SELL THEM.
<thisguy> arent we filled with enough toxins as is? how would organic make things any different
<Dark92Enigma> NO WAY.........
<Vordox> TheMaster: Wrong
<TheMaster> You think a company would expose itself to a lawsuit if the food they sold was poisonous?
<thelonepony> cachi01: Are you God?!!!!
<cachi01> Nerom: nope but chuck norris is my dad
<VenHur> 107?! My god, he looks less younger than that!
<TheMaster> beyond accidental or oversight. The food has to be regulated
<spud> mmmmm sourpussy
<Chrysalis> but i like sour food
<Nerom> Then your Jesus
<Cypresswolf> I dont care how healthy organic food maybe - I dont want to live on this planet for 107 years
<Vordox> TheMaster: Yes, Heard of COke?
<Mega_Milk> cachi01: Close enough.
<VenHur> ...Maybe my mind's playing tricks.
<cachi01> thelonepony: god must be like 4000,00000,00 years old lol
<cachi01> Mega_Milk: lol
<Tovler> Is there a Bullshit on GMOs?
<thisguy> o.O
<SirGanjalf> Tovler: I believe it's in this ep as well.
<GilDash> "Real science fucks up everything." XD
<Dark_Horst> ....bigger breasts is bad?
<Mega_Milk> bigger breast......
<Dark92Enigma> Tovler: There was one with New Age IIRC
<TheMaster> Coke has labels to see whats in it. We're talking about tomatoes and corn
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: I know right? He looks NOTHING like 107. :O
<Saturn> 08,01there was someone on reddit who sold firewood

<YourLittleDashie> I hate soy milk it tastes like garbage
<Spectrum_Rush> chat will ya grow up
<TheMaster> and hormones are what you need, don't be stupid just because it scares you
<StinkomanFan> Yay!

<CriticKitten> I know, horrific.
<TheMaster> they grow boobs if you drink any milk

<Shizuka> 13i'm pretty sure i'll never be allowed into a scientific study cause i know what they're looking for when they give you choices
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Cypresswolf> Kandarihu: 107 years ago were much better times - imagine telling your grandkids about working during the Industrial Revolution, driving one of the first automobiles, living through WW1 & 2 etc.
<TheMaster> its almost as if anyone can be gullible and open to suggestions that fit within their pre conceived notions
<YourLittleDashie> DAT PLANE
<Shizuka> 13this one tastes better, therefore it's not the organic one because you expect me to say it's organic
<CriticKitten> POISONS!
<thisguy> you know what farms need? ladybugs, they eat quite a few pests on crops
<TheMaster> right wing or left, people are idiots
<cachi01> I WANNA BE AN SCP =D

<YourLittleDashie> 1 cup of tea = caffiene of 4 cups of coffee
<CriticKitten> The most safest!
<Dark_Horst> fuck organic
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, he was born into a time before the Progressive movement even started. Surely such a guy was educated with original sources instead of what public schools give kids nowadays.
<Dark92Enigma> i've been drinking non-organic milk------Is it me.....or am i growing MANBOOBS???? Nah, i need diet :D

<Shizuka> 13oh wow
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Dark_Horst> i call bullshit on tht
*Bronysith likes taco bell
<Vordox> Sumica: The GRADE of the stupidity... :P
<CriticKitten> Best part? Recent research is confirming that people who are slightly obese are HEALTHIER than skinny people.
<cachi01> ............
<Cypresswolf> Everything has a potentially deadly side effect - get sick? take this pill, side effects are worse than actuall ailment
<Nerom> and cornsyrup

<Nerom> She forgot the cornsyrup and starch
<Dark_Horst> CriticKitten: course. it's natural. it'S what biology intends for a living organism
<Conyst> If I die early it's because of the bad drivers in my family.
<cachi01> ..........
<Silver_Soother> CriticKitten: Wait, really? Do you have a link to something that talks about that research?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica supidity is the way natural selection works :3
<Wrek> 05i want to slap her to hell
<Buytoast> what?
<CriticKitten> Fat, sugar, and salt. These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little burger.
<TheMaster> its called eating
<Buytoast> how dare you eat!
<killerpony7733> Funny i have eaten fast food yet i haven't gained weight. I slowly lost weight actually :D

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> NewSuperBronyU: sounds yummy
<thelonepony> NewSuperBronyU: i want a burger :3
<Nerom> NewSuperBronyU: I envy you
<Wrek> 05Lyra`: slap her from me afterwards
<Meanwhile> The wrath of Xenu.
<CriticKitten> But Ronald McDonald accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix....PINK SLIME
<twilight_sprinkle> its not about taste, they stuff it with the kind of things that your body always feels like it wants
<Lyra`> i might during!~

<CriticKitten> THUS THE MCDONALD'S BURGER WAS BORN!
<Tovler> :( if only it was safe for me to constantly eat fast food.
<Lyra`> it burns more calories <3
<Cypresswolf> I had chicken fried steak, fries, & a salad with 4 ounces of ranch dressing - and I get to not starve another day :) Victory!
<thisguy> one of my favs along with double western :)
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Sounds delicious! :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Lyra`: Hahah ;P

<Lyra`> see, everyone knows :3
<Shizuka> 13mmmm famous daves
<thisguy> mmmmmmm :)
<Bronysith> Lyra`: the reason why i burn more calories is because im constantly thinking of new ideas and burning calories with brain power (L logic)
<Wrek> 05will be a superskråv from Maria's a bit away from here
<Lyra`> my lunch tomorrow is going to be a carrot.
<Shizuka> 13good brisket

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Sumica: It's the name of a burger >>
<CriticKitten> Silver_Soother: Yep! Mind, it's only slight obesity. But it's actually healthier to have a bit of a gut. Skinny folks tend to have less nutrients in their body and are more vunerable to disease and other problems.
<GilDash> RaveBrony: It's a trap!
<Meanwhile> I've never heard of half of this stuff.
<SirGanjalf> :O

<Sumica> 00,10scroll down
<Conyst> I cook*
<RaveBrony> i havent been to a Steak'n'Shake since i moved to NY.....

<thisguy> o.o
<Tovler> fancy restaurants are healthier? I don't remember that meme
<CriticKitten> Dark92Enigma: Yep, it's true. My dad is an RN (registered nurse) and has been keeping up with it. He can confirm it with his own experience too, his skinny patients are visiting him more often and for worse stuff, in general. :P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I remember when Burger King used to have those cheese fries that you would put the fries in a bag and then shake it up with a cheese powder >>...I miss then ><

<Yahooz> my Stats teacher has an unhealthy obsession with chick-fil-a
<Bronysith> Saturn: i want to one day...
<Silver_Soother> Saturn: Oh my.... Call me? ;)
<Meanwhile> Most of the fast food places in America only seem to exist there.
<Vordox> Saturn: No y...OH I c wut u did thar.
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: Sex-ception
<Sumica> 00,10nuts can bark?
<ASoftFluffyThing> And their hash browns!
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I see what you did there. :P
<CriticKitten> *I don't support them any more, after it was made clear how they spend their money to fight gay rights. Hey, it's their money, fair enough, and they can spend it how they like....just as I can choose not to spend MY money there.
<cachi01> ASoftFluffyThing: waffle house has best waffles!
<StinkomanFan> :D
<Shizuka> 13you are an unfit mother, carls jr believes every child deserves to have a caring mother, your children will be transferred to the care of carls jr

<Buytoast> sounds like a kung fu sex move
<Bronysith> Wrek: how about we force feed her big macs for 2 weeks
<Yahooz> PISS OFF MIMI
<Cypresswolf> As far as burgers go, there are different compenent to each fast food burger that if taken out and reassemble into the best of everything would make one epic burger
<twilight_sprinkle> shes telling the truth though.
<CriticKitten> Uh.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Who the fuck is Mimi?

<Cranberry_Scotch> The thing is, Chik-fil-a is a minority
<cachi01> WAIT. WE ARE WATCHING IT FROM YOUTUBE? WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE NO BEWBZ RULE?
<Tovler> I love fast food. ;-; for the 4 minutes I'm eating it, it's like I'm taking a vacation.
<Meanwhile> A curse on the fact that this food is tasty.

<Shizuka> 13we keep eating nonstop... you know cause we kind of need to?
<Sumica> 00,10exersise your fucking self controll
<The_Awesomeness> yeah fast food makers take advantage of the fact that food tastes good to sell food
<Meanwhile> But yeah, really, you're fat because you don't stop eating you five thousand pound fatty fat fat.
<SirGanjalf> *they're

<Silver_Soother> Cypresswolf: I could get some Sonic right now.... *drools* I NEED FOOD!
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: the Rason it seems tasty is Because of what she said
<Vordox> TRAINING!?
<Cranberry_Scotch> The number of products that support gay rights outnumbers the number of products that don't
<Vordox> YOU MAD
<StinkomanFan> :)
<twilight_sprinkle> *reason
<Silver_Soother> Everything is making me hungry! :(
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: a kilo of burgers is like a kilo of carrots? :D
<CriticKitten> Oh, another fun fact: It's probably more healthy for people to eat smaller meals more regularly throughout the day than to eat three big meals at designated hours.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Cypresswolf: lol reminds me of Epic Meal Time's Fast Food Lasagna :D
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle you're a bellend nothing you say matters.
<Lyra`> shes being sarcastic.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: get an education pls, kthxbai
<Bronysith> i wish i could eat at home more often...no one has time anymore though
<Yahooz> i just want to point out that Taco Bell is probably the worse food i have ever consumed
<Vordox> CriticKitten: That's a hypotheis, right?
<Yahooz> *worst
<Lyra`> the ideas of the world.
<Tovler> wow… it's THAT impossible, huh?
*Meanwhile ...back wherever that was I wasn't entirely listening.
<cachi01> nope. that would be boring
<ASoftFluffyThing> The Cook-Out makes some good hotdogs

<Dark_Horst> you get steak like shoe-leather there
<Buytoast> ahaha
<Silver_Soother> Bronysith: I used to eat out all the time; then I moved and am now doing home eating. I miss the eating out, but honestly; I prefer the home eating. When is the last time you ate at him?
<Buytoast> oh mind games
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Africa isn't evil D:
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: chaotic good to be exact
<Buytoast> why are you so good
<thisguy> that sounds like a multiplayer map for a cod game
<Yahooz> Nintendo is evil, but Microsoft is eviler
<Sumica> 00,10it comes in a 55gallon drum in dowdered form. they hook up a hotwater line to the drum and have beans on tap
<Bronysith> Silver_Soother: today :D
*gunthler boops SB's moo nose :3
<Lyra`> africa is always evil in video games and movies
<Silver_Soother> Bronysith: Awesome! /)
<cachi01> Yahooz: and lets not get started with sony and apple
<Vordox> JUST SO YOU ALL KNOW
<Meanwhile> Lyra`s been on cracked.
<Vordox> THIS IS ALL ABOUT PLACEBO EFFECT
<GilDash> Yahooz: And Apple even more so.
<Lyra`> its full of black people with guns who mine diamonds. kind of like dwarfs
<twilight_sprinkle> so what, this whole episode is devoted to proving fast food is tasty? brilliant. all the money that went into this was definitely worth it, nothing hypocritical at all
<CriticKitten> Vordox: It's a very large point of contention nowadays, actually. Some argue it's healthier and helps you lose weight, other data suggests it likely doesn't. It's not verified yet.
<Bronysith> Silver_Soother: i like home cooked meals over going out...except home cooked chicken, i dont like grilled chicken...unless it is actually done right
<Shizuka> 13can't possibly be because we're more active
<Silver_Soother> I have big pants in my office, LISTEN TO MY OPINION!
<Yahooz> GilDash: meh. at least they seel iphones for like 40 bucks

<RaveBrony> Lmao
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Basically. I lean towards extra meals in smaller helpings being more beneficial though myself. Works well for me to keep my blood sugar up.

<gunthler> Meanwhile, Gondor, that's who.
<Dark_Horst> SHUTN UP!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: 300?
<Cypresswolf> fast food doesnt mean fattening - it all depends whats in it - Taco Bell often has fresh produce added to their food, ground beef is the same everywhere - only the idiots who dont know how to cook fuck it up - the sauce is sour cream, and its not even that much
<cachi01> Shizuka: over 9000?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've eaten an 8 oz chocolate bar in about an hour

<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: well yeah there's the "you need fat to survive winter but too much kills you" but still, shouldn't it be your decision?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: obesity is proven to be unhealthy. a bit of fat doesnt hurt anyone though
<StinkomanFan> What a nice lady :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Are you streaming?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: but if you eat certain fats, then your body is trained to burn all the fat instead of just storing it like sugar
<donutpop365> MadSurge: A fun one I can assume?

<Randomnerd> "Bullshit" took a huge downturn after the first season.
<donutpop365> MadSurge: Or swim team?
<CriticKitten> Governments exist to provide services and protection for their citizens. NOT to regulate what they get to do. Screw that logic. Go eat a goddamn Big Mac, Mimi.
