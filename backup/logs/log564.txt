<PONY> iGor
<DuskStarshimmer> <3
<Kencolt> Pale_Horse: Perhaps-- but it's also a comedy that actually works withing the timeline of the 5 universal Frankenstien films. And works as a series closing. Just sillier.
<Combustiblelemons> i love this guy.
<Brony4Eva> eyegor!
<otakon> now THAT is a original troll face
<PONY> Igor had CHILDREN???
<MadSurge> Derpy would make a fine Marty Feldman

<Marx> Also anyone noticed the "Locked" door that opened anyway?
<DocSane> And this is why you play test, folks
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, pretty sure you should be able to sequencebreak after 'dat glitch
<Pale_Horse> I take it back. Lex Luthor is NOT a genius.... A real genius would have been able to kill Supes over 1000 different ways if he really had him in his power like this. Lex is a bucking idiot. :|
<sagas> Ha no that would be a useful glitch. No way that would happen
<Azura> wtf did lex do now?
<lunac> Like Ultimate 5 the worst enemy is the FLOOOR
<alexxm> what just happened
<Ramdomguy> i can imagine his face getting red by the second
<sagas> This game is just so wrong

<MaidSurge> Oh my god, he's hollow inside!
<sagas> otakon: Youre in th floor. What do you expect
<PONY> This is Purgatory... You should see hell
<Iron_Waffle> WTF
<ponibas> rofl
<lunac> Superman gains Federation phase cloak
<sagas> That was unexpected
<DocSane> Someone needs to make a comic book adventure based on this game, including the glitches.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi everypony
<HatchetRyda> the superman has been doubled
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: it's like a trainwreck on LSD.
<Ramdomguy> hello
<Dken2021> hai HatsuneMikuFan

<HatsuneMikuFan> you?
<Pale_Horse> hehe
<MaidSurge> NICE
<otakon> wow, bullshit
<Marx> So SuperBrony64, any other advice you have for my N64 problem? The red light on the system turns on, so I think that means the system itself works.
<otakon> Goddamn this game is an affront to humanity
<Maid_Discord> 11,01You lose *cutscene*
<lunac> How do you become a streamer?
<sagas> What if the glitches in this game were intentional? Just to showcase Lex's poor virtual reality programing?
<HatchetRyda> Dark92Enigma: i could see that happening lol
<Iron_Waffle> Hahahahaha. Hahahahaha. Hahahahaha.
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma discord is teaming up with the total package?

<sagas> lunac: Im submitting that for next movie night now
<Spitfire> lunac: only mods can control the stream
<lunac> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Marx: I don't know what the issue could be...if the Power Supply is faulty, it could be ruining your system when it's in use. I'd be safe and just find a replacement online. None of my Power Supplies have ever had a buzzing sound like that. As for the system not showing anything, it could be an issue with the cartridge reader if it's not the power supply.
<lunac> sagas you swine!
<Very_Silly_Filly> WALL TEXT
<DeadlyPon3> Luthurrrr
<lunac> ;)
<otakon> LUTHOO!

<DeadlyPon3> ...
<lunac> the hell?
<otakon> rabidsonic: it is considered as such
<DeadlyPon3> That was seriously the dumbest fight in the history of mankind
<Dark92Enigma-2> alexxm NC: IT MAKES NO SENSE!
<DocSane> rabidsonic: No, that would be E.T.
<sagas> lunac: except not going through rings
<Iron_Waffle> That was a fight?
<Very_Silly_Filly> N64 really suffered with aliasing
<Pale_Horse> The Aquaman game was also terrible
<fapplebloom> luthor was cardboard all along!
<lunac> Your Superman smash the damn glass
<Dark92Enigma-2> alexxm AVGN: Cowabunga?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Marx: Np, though you might do better getting it on Amazon, it's about $10 there :)
<MaidSurge> lunac: only fighting aliens or supercriminals is dangerous for Supes
<otakon> DeadlyPon3: the Leader fight in the SNES Hulk game is worse. You literally punch him once and you win.
<Dark92Enigma-2> AVGN: COWAFUCKING PIECE OF DOG SHIT
<rabidsonic> yea your right

<fapplebloom> Alister: YOU SAID PONY AAAAAAHHH
<Petrified_Discord> Alister: Pretty much
<Very_Silly_Filly> otakon: Google it, apparently very screwed up
<Marx> otakon, On that topic, there's a cutscene in Skyward Sword that actually doesn't work properly on my original Wii. Apparently my old Wii can't process the cutscene and freezes every time it tries to run it. Thankfully I had a spare Wii on hand.
<otakon> Very_Silly_Filly: odl
<PONY> Walking into the fist of the hero... Like a BOSS
<Pale_Horse> I'm pretty sure the Leader fight was SUPPOSED to be anti-climactic... Cause he dosen't have the super strength to directly fight the Hulk... Of course while that might work for a story it amkes a poor game end boss.
<sagas> LOTR!
<otakon> Marx: weird
<BronyInstrumental> \_YES_(o)_/\_(o)_NO_/

<cyber_pony13> fapplebloom: besides my team being a cyborg has had me learn something
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Can't get it for free.
<otakon> Maid_Discord: think I was partially folded in half crushing a section in between my ribs and stomach for like a second.
<Ryunosuke> because here, Money > someones life

<Ryunosuke> >:(
<cyber_pony13> fapplebloom: *time
<otakon> I'm afraid I ruptured my stomach or something.
<MaidSaturn> 08,01"i have no money so i can't go to the doctor" shouldn't be something that happens in a *civilised* country
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Money > everything in the US.
<CriticKitten> ....uh.
<fapplebloom> cyber_pony13: you never asked for this...
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Downside of corporatism.
<Cypresswolf> http://woonastuck.tumblr.com/ - Moonstuck tumblr for the rest of the story :)
<Maidwhile> Shame that it does isn't it MaidSaturn.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Cypresswolf: Find my questions there.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I have three.
<otakon> I've been gassy(belching and flatuus) and suddenly tired.
<Cypresswolf> Challege Accepted!
<otakon> I think dyspipsia
<MaidSaturn> 08,01is DCD about?
<fapplebloom> downer...
<MaidSaturn> 08,01if you're worried about your injuries, he's the man to ask
<cyber_pony13> lunac: hmmm.... those cyber ponies seem to be the old models so termination for them is imminant
<lunac> k
<cyber_pony13> fapplebloom: what did i never ask for
<otakon> MaidSaturn: he's not about, and I did the whole "folded" bit about 2 days ago.
<fapplebloom> cyber_pony13: nevermind, stupid reference
<cyber_pony13> :P
<Maid_Discord> 11,01How is government healthcare?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I heard it sucked in Canada.
<cyber_pony13> fapplebloom: that awkwatd moment when others dont get your referemce
<cyber_pony13> fapplebloom: *reference
<otakon> Maid_Discord: ask Derm if you get the chance
<owloysius> It's okay, i guess.
<fapplebloom> cyber_pony13: you might have gotten it if you werent a ROBOT
<cyber_pony13> fapplebloom: CYBORG different from robot
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I forget. Even when you have healthcare, you still don't want to go to the doctor because health insurance companies can be a pain in the ass to deal with.
<CriticKitten> Oh, wait, otakon it happened two days ago?
<fapplebloom> cyber_pony13: sorry
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah
<lunac> Maid_Discord you don;t have to pay to be healed/saved
<SpitfireRockz01> Who likes Spitfire? :3
<cyber_pony13> fapplebloom: thank you
*Maid_Discord 11,01paints panda
<CriticKitten> If you'd ruptured your stomach you'd know by now.
<otakon> CriticKitten: what does that mean? I'm just getting sick?
<otakon> CriticKitten: phew
<otakon> YAY! I JUST HAVE A SUMMER FLU!
<otakon> apparently
<otakon> or it's stress

<otakon> MaidSaturn: first is NOT Chrysalis but it's nice :)
<alexxm> nice pic Saturn
<fapplebloom> Maid_Discord: TRAITOR
<CriticKitten> Obviously check with DCD to be 100% safe, but if you've gone two full days without any significant discomfort in that region, you're likely alright.
<lunac> Maid_Discord I;d happily welcome you ot he free world
<Maid_Discord> 11,01fapplebloom: Not really a traitor. Just hate the govt here.
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah, worst I got was a sore neck
<CriticKitten> Usually if you do something as serious as puncture your stomach, you figure it out pretty quick. Stomach acid isn't fond of your insides. :P
<fapplebloom> Maid_Discord: where exactly?
<otakon> CriticKitten: yeah I guess
<CriticKitten> No discomfort beyond being gassy?
<CriticKitten> No pain when you sit/stand, that sort of thing?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01fapplebloom: Move to Denmark or Sweden.

<alexxm> HatsuneMikuFan it is a weapon made by the anti spirals

<[SWAG]Haku> Yo OohShiny
<Major> SparkleButt: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltah20kREz1qbvg3o.gif

<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: Zuuul is all-powerful, he is everything but nothing
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Petrified_Discord: IKR?
<Vordox> Would you guys mind helping me out? :P
<Vordox> It's about an online Petition
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: I don't get....
<OohShiny> Anyone here have a movie sensation in the Season 2 Finale?
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: :) I've noticed - the rocks and bones would land in such a way, I kept walking over them instead of moving them
<Vordox> Anyone...?
<pony_729257> hi
<OohShiny> I was wondering if it was just me
<[SWAG]Haku> OohShiny Dude, everyone did
<SparkleButt> Wow, chat popped out for a sec
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Heimerdinger is OP i know cause i'm using it.
<Petrified_Discord> I admire the dedication going into this tile
<MahBoi777> AttacktheAndalite: that's okay, Zuul doesn't need logic
<[SWAG]Haku> The finale could have been a movie all on its own, but it was due to time restraints that it was shorter
<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: *still confused*
<[SWAG]Haku> Well, Haku is leaving
<[SWAG]Haku> cya everypony
<OohShiny> cya Haku

<MahBoi777> Vordox: sure
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: baskets can be used too, the half baskets sometimes play nicer
<OohShiny> anyone shaking the head?
<Shizuka> 13but yeah sometimes the smaller rocks land too low and you just start walking over
<Vordox> Damnit, hickupp
<Vordox> May I please have some people attention here.
<Shizuka> 13heimerdinger meisterburger?
<OohShiny> sup bro?
<Meanwhile> LoL.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Vordox: What's up?
<Vordox> There has been another one of those "Disc Content, but needs to be unlocked via Online" again
*Petrified_Discord stares at Vordox O_O
<MahBoi777> ?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> now im wondering is this a bakery, pizzaria, supermarket, or something else entirely?
<Shizuka> 13what a shock
<OohShiny> what?
<Vordox> Like the ME3 Quest/Story part already in the disc but needed to be bought/released
<Meanwhile> As in, League of Legends.
<Cypresswolf> I'm going to go out for a bit for some food first - might take a while to finish Teledahn, then I want to get a little way through Edar Kem
<OohShiny> disc content?
<Shizuka> 13sorry
*Shizuka 13puts her deus ex shades on
<Shizuka> 13Vordox: what a shame
<OohShiny> what is he talking about?
<MahBoi777> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: maybe it is all three combined
<Vordox> This has happened again to another game, although it is beloved until this sudden interest that came up about 2 months ago when a hacker decided to go through the disc
<Vordox> White Knight Chronicles 2
<Vordox> Shizuka: What's the point of the shades and stuff Shizuka ?
<Vordox> What's wih the IRc server, it's borked big time.
<Meanwhile> And while it's somewhat relevant, Corki needs to crash his plane off a cliff.
<Meanwhile> Borkborkbork.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> oh how fun it is to be apart of a community of ponies http://derpy.me/MGPhX

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> HIDE YOUR KIDS, HIDE YOUR WIFE THE CHATS SENTIENT!
<OohShiny> from where that music is?
<Vordox1> However, Wk2 is pretty much hardcore fan base of smaller amount of people, so every signature is highly important
<AttacktheAndalite> I heard the sound that plays when there's 100 seconds left in super Mario Bros when I got kickd
<kirzstryfe> 8,6last song was Party of One Rescore
<Yahooz> oh kickbots acting up?
<Meanwhile> I will? what?

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Yahooz: heh yeah, my only first and only kick was from Nittany_Discord, reason? never being kicked before :D
<Yahooz> Ohai Tom
<Vordox1> The petition in particular gives a brief explanation why we seek an people who have the same ideals of On Game Disc
<Vordox1> http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/wkc2/

<Vordox1> It is exactly the same as Mass Effect incident. >< But this was 1 year prior, and only lately been found out through the Hack attemot of the Disc
*Nyria pokes Tom~ "Are you real?~"
<Shizuka> 13some silly mod or ircop found botserv's controls..
<Yahooz> I wonder who
<Yahooz> hmmmmmmmmmmm
<Shizuka> 13tom is no more sentient than my turkey sandvich
<hen3ry> I assume it's an IRCop, since Tom has IRCop powers.
<Vordox1> If people please sign this, for not the game, but for the choice of EVERYTHING that is on the Disc should be open IF IT IS FINISHED
<Meanwhile> Shizu's face when her sandvich talks.
<ponibas> SAMVICH!
<OohShiny> INTRO THEME
<Yahooz> hen3ry: only MakerDusk is in here... hes not doing anything
<Yahooz> its a mod
<Shizuka> 13so you think

<Yahooz> well
<hen3ry> Tom just said "even when I'm not in here" ... <.< >.>

<Meanwhile> He's also your destiny.
<FillyFlam> He's a dumb rock that holds up the world.
<MahBoi777> poor sandvich has feelings :S

<AttacktheAndalite> What's her name, kirzstryfe?

<maidlicious> it's well bread
<MahBoi777> awwwwww
<Ninjazz> >_>
<Meanwhile> kirz if there is one thing on my mind when I see a raptor made of bread wearing a skirt it isn't "I wonder what gender that is"
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't.
<Sylandest> :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe what no handbag ?
<maidlicious> kirzstryfe: i don't think you can tell for dinosaurs

<Reikim> You wish you had a bread raptor.
<AttacktheAndalite> kirzstryfe: You can try but you'll probably get your face clawed off for it.
<maidlicious> i don't know why people look forward to them
<kirzstryfe> 8,6you get sticky, actually, they all have bear claws >.>
<CriticKitten> ....
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: I'm not sure where that logic came from but I've decided not to question it.
<Shizuka> 13pssst buy l4d1 instead, it's better
<AttacktheAndalite> Still....you'd end up with a messed-up face, provided it lets you live
<CriticKitten> Silly Shizu, why get one when you can get both? :P
<CriticKitten> The pair of 'em together is just 7 and a half bucks.
<Reikim> Five bucks for L4D and L4D2 each? Good lord I love Steam.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Warning, epic gif incoming
*AttacktheAndalite wishes she had money to buy a new laptop and both games
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/HlNm1.gif
<CriticKitten> 5 per game or the pair for 7.50, 's pretty damn good. XD
<AttacktheAndalite> Sweet, CrimsonPhoenix. You did that/
<CriticKitten> Also if you don't already own it, you have a bit under 2 hours left to get KOTOR for $2.49, gogogogogogogogo.
<Unnr|Laptop> Mmmm kotor
<CrimsonPhoenix> AttacktheAndalite, nah I suck at drawing
<maidlicious> what's kotor?
<Shizuka> 13eh kotor was... eh...
<AttacktheAndalite> CrimsonPhoenix: Still, it's badass
<Shizuka> 13never finished
<CrimsonPhoenix> knight of the old republic
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Bronystate, what did enter into?
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi OmegaMetroidBrony
<Unnr|Laptop> But KotOR has HK-47
<crazypony> hi O
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Doncha mean KOTOR2?
<crazypony> oops
<Shizuka> 13never played that
<CriticKitten> That was the one that didn't get finished.
<Shizuka> 13got like 10 hours into kotor 1 though... still not sure what happened
<CriticKitten> The first one was by Bioware pre-EA suckage.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6probably got to the grasslands and it exploded the computer
<Sumica> 00,10eeeeyup
<Shizuka> 13i think i stopped around some grassy land
<Shizuka> 13not cause kimiko blew up but because i was terribly bored
<Sumica> 00,10graslands killed my comp and that was like 8 years after the game came out
<CriticKitten> And yeah, Unnr has a point. KOTOR is worth the 2 and a half bucks for HK-47 alone.
<Sumica> 00,10now the game just wont run
<maidlicious> why do i assume this is the pillows
<Sumica> 00,10cause it is the pillows
<maidlicious> oh good.

<CrimsonPhoenix> why do I need to make a goddamn account in origin for it...
<Monotone> yo!
<RedHelper> Hello
<Ninjazz> Eyush.
<RedHelper> Wat?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6CrimsonPhoenix, because [insert Nittany_Discord rant #5]
<maidlicious> fuck
<CriticKitten> CrimsonPhoenix: Because EA hates you.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well EA is shit
<CriticKitten> That's the only logical rationale for most of their decisions. :D
<Ninjazz> EA hates everything... except money.
<Ninjazz> EA loves money.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still since it's in steam why bother
<Monotone> oh crap i just realized tht the song is Art of the Dress XD
<Reikim> Isn't EA doing poorly right now? I remember Nitt mentioning something of the sort.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: of course
<Ninjazz> Oh, EA is doing poorly?
<Ninjazz> Well that means we're in for a bad time. =_=
<CriticKitten> No, Nitt's just hopeful because their stocks have gone down.
<Ninjazz> I'm sure they would take that the same way, though. :S
<Jspang1> its always fun to see someone who can actually draw
<Reikim> Whelp, if 4kids went bankrupt, then I'm sure EA can pull off the same feat.
<Jspang1> o hey this is art of the dress
<killerpony7733> Good morning everypony :)
<Ponies47> Morning killerpony7733 :)
<MahBoi777> mornin killerpony7733
<Ninjazz> Heyo, killerpony7733.
<CriticKitten> Ninjazz: Nintendo's stocks went down after E3 too. I'd wager the number of fucks given approaches zero
<Reikim> morning killerpony7733
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, killerpony7733
<Monotone> i just said that XD
<Reikim> CriticKitten: But then, this is Nintendo we're talking about. EA and Nintendo are two very different buckets
<Monotone> its evening over here XD
<Reikim> CriticKitten: The difference being that one is full of holes while the other is merely under a bright light.
<Jspang1> i cant draw worth shit :'(
<Reikim> Jspang1: Practice until your hand goes numb.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Almost everyone's stocks went down after E3. It was just a shitty E3 performance in general.
<TheGallopingGeezer> You're not alone, Jspang1
<CriticKitten> Reikim: It's hardly indicative of the company failing.
<Jspang1> Reikim: i dont have that kind of time on my hands
<Sumica> 00,10Badnews, I managed to find the B movie
<lunac> volume is too loud
<Reikim> CriticKitten: I won't argue there. Though there were moments in E3, they were far too far between.
<AttacktheAndalite> Sumica: That's bad how?
<Vordox1> Sumica: English or French?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica, and?
<Sumica> 00,10English
<Vordox1> OMG

<Jspang1> lunac: theres a magic button on your comp thats called the volume control
<Reikim> This is going to be glorious.
<Sumica> 00,10it reminds much of 3DO zelda
<CriticKitten> Oh god.
<Vordox> Sumica: Trust me, it's one of those movies taht grows on you
<Vordox> .D
<Reikim> Sumi. This is a GOOD THING.

<Monotone> whut we talking bout?
<Reikim> Sumica: Mah boi! This badness is what all true B-movies strive for!
<Jspang1> i hate this remix
<Ponies47> Ah yes this song
<AttacktheAndalite> Aww this song
<Unnr|Laptop> MahBoi777: All I have to say is CD-i Zelda
<Sumica> 00,10no the movie does it fine
<Monotone> YEAYEHHH

<AttacktheAndalite> MahBoi777: Mah boi, this peace is what all true warriors strive for.
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> MahBoi777: the CD-I is what all true warriors strive for MAHBOI
<derpy_pony> good morning :)
<CriticKitten> Oh, also, I has L4D1/2 nao, ~yay~ I have a shooter that I can play and suck at while people laugh at me! :D

<Unnr|Laptop> Dark Side of Phobos is a good OST
<Reikim> Unnr|Laptop: Hilariously it's not an OST. It's a fan remix album :P
<Unnr|Laptop> About the second most awesome thing to come from OC remix

<Ninjazz> Slight drop in audio quality, I would say.
<Shizuka> 13i was trying to jump to a steve rot remix of doom 2 but winamp didn't play along
<Ninjazz> But that's probably intentional.
<LightningDashFast> *carries BFG around*

<Shizuka> 13yes
<LightningDashFast> oh GOD DISCORD:'(
<LightningDashFast> creepy

<Monotone> whats the song? the video isnt playing...
<LightningDashFast> yay Danger ZONE
<Kandarihu> Well, maybe I could frame the question like this: does anyone have an extra free copy of Frozen Synapse, and looking for someone to give it to?
<Shizuka> 13Monotone: if you hear the music, the video is playing, he is doing fine details though so not much changes from frame to frame
<CrimsonPhoenix> heh?
<LightningDashFast> Top Gun Dashie
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think I played an Ace Combat mission and had this song playing
<Monotone> the music isnt playing and i dont have it on mute...
<Kandarihu> I always heard the lyrics as "Fly in to the Danger Zone"
<Shizuka> 13i always thought it was that too
<Reikim> Monotone: Then your stream is broken. *gives duct tape*
<Reikim> Kandarihu: ...It's not?
<LightningDashFast> definitely something dashie would do
<Shizuka> 13i mean i know it's highway but you just can't unhear "fly in to" once you do..
<Monotone> damn...
<Sumica> 00,10so Hub had a trolly in San Deigo done up in ponies eh?
<Kandarihu> I guess it's not. You always heard it as that too?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if you were having sound issues before and it's dead now Monotone, it's either a connection issue on your end, or your sound card died
<kirzstryfe> 8,6or headphones

<Shizuka> 13wish i could :/
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I played the demo for the new Top Gun game

<Dermathil> Yahooz: We didn't have teasers mid-summer last year. Only the slip about Discord around early-August

<Monotone> X3 is it true Discord's really coming back?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Spectrum_Rush|shrugs ^-^
<Kandarihu> I'm trying to juggle the discount for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Frozen Synapse, and the Left 4 Dead bundle. But I only really have enough money for one of them.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dermathil: Yesh
<Vordox> God damn you Munchins...
<Yahooz> Dermathil: i was around then. either way i dont pay attention to spoilers
*Spectrum_Rush|shrugs hugs SuperBrony64
*SuperBrony64 hugs Spectrum_Rush|shrugs back :3
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> :$
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: honestly go for l4d
<Dermathil> Yahooz: I do. That's what makes it soooo haaaaard.
<AttacktheAndalite> Hi SuperBrony64

*MahBoi777 higs SuperBrony64
<Dermathil> also, I bought Crusader Kings 2.
<Shizuka> 13derp didn't think it ended that abruptly
<Yahooz> to not tell?
<Shizuka> 13hard to queue up the next track when it jumps the playlist from under me...
<Kandarihu> Are we going to see more L4D on the stream in the forseeable future?
<Dermathil> that game is SUCH A TIME SINK
<Reikim> What would this son gbee?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this is reminding me of the MK theme
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Reikim> *song be
<Pudge> Hey everypony.
<Shizuka> 13so fun story
<Yahooz> Spoilers are means of ruining your priceless reaction when you see it live
*SuperBrony64 higs MahBoi777 back :3
<Shizuka> 13this song comes from a little known game called Dethkarz from like 1999 i think
<MahBoi777> XD
<Shizuka> 13somewhere around there
<Reikim> Is it like the Silver Surfer game? Cruddy game, stellar soundtrack?
<Monotone> @SaxyPretender: omg ur right!
<Shizuka> 13just about
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
*Maid_Discord 11,01hugs Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13but anyway, so it's that late 90s game soundtrack is actually tracks on the CD right?
<Kandarihu> WOW, I just realized that I just really pushed the boundaries there.
<Dermathil> Yahooz, you don't really ruin the reaction. You get it twice. Once to the teaser itself, again to how it fits in the big picture. That's my reasoning behind why watching spoilers.
<Shizuka> 13so when i plugged this in to rip it, no matter where i did it, media player always thought it was the Deep Purple best of album
<Shizuka> 13so this one happens to be "called" Space Truckin
<Maid_Discord> 11,01No hug back :<
*Shizuka 13hugs Maid_Discord <3
*Reikim laughs
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Thanks <3
<Monotone> wait ur talking bout Meta Knight from Kirby?
<Dermathil> Shizuka: the Deep Purple best of album is awesome.
<Monotone> right?
<Dermathil> I gots it.
<Yahooz> Dermathil: im a suprise kind of guy. i can see where your coming from though
<Shizuka> 13sadly there is no "smoke on the water" track in here, but what's funny is the track names go pretty well with the tracks themselves
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Spoiler alert: you all are awesome :3
<Shizuka> 13"black night" is this kind of ambient thing used for the menu, "speed king" and "fireball" sound like they should be racing game songs
<hen3ry> I thought the rule was no spoilers, Saxy. :/
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> :O
<Shamroc> SaxyPretender: NO SPOILER!
<Reikim> Dammit, Saxy! You ruined the surprise. Ruined it FOREVER.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;___;
<Yahooz> Spoiler alert: Fighting is Magic stream was awesome
<Kandarihu> I think I might be well justified in asking that of Shizuka. But it doesn't make what I said okay.
<Shizuka> 13missed it
<Dermathil> Spoiler Alert: 2001 A Space Odyssey has a sequel.
<Yahooz> dem RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSU

<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<Ponies47> brb
<Shizuka> 13remix of Love the Way You Lie by Eminem + Rhianna
<Kandarihu> Well, what he said technically applies to me after almost telling Shizuka what to stream. So it's a very untrue spoiler, that we're all awesome.
<Yahooz> This Scout is the best rapper ever
<Shizuka> 13ah, nah i don't stream l4d cause asuka already hates me enough for playing it
<FlareChaser> klolwut
<Yahooz> Eminem got nothing on this shit
<Shizuka> 13streaming source is out for a while til i disassemble my desk and dust everything
<Reikim> Kandarihu: You didn't tell Shizu what to stream, not that I saw. Just asked whether it will be streamed in the future.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wait Shizuka, you didn't just referenced P&SwG?
<LightningDashFast> O.o TF2 scout
<Shizuka> 13CrimsonPhoenix: i figured i was referencing the minecraft video where a guy uses blue dye on wool and someone freaks out that it's against the rules
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> uberhaxxornova

<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> SaxyPretender: your face is abit messed there, you all right

<Yahooz> Scout > Eminem
<CrimsonPhoenix> now shush before you get ban
<Cypresswolf> this just makes me want to listen to the slap chop scout ad again :)
<Reikim> Not even discussing spoilers. Discussing spoilers leads to spoilers.
<Monotone> yeah, no spoilers...
<Yahooz> wait...
<Shizuka> 13this song kinda messes me up when it comes up during tf2
<Shizuka> 13can't imagine why :3

<Reikim> Dunno why, you never play medic.
<maidlicious> no idea
<Yahooz> Ah this song
<Polydunami> Yeah, let's not talk about spoilers; save the drama for until the show actually airs ;)

<Reikim> Shizuka: Recursive streamception? :O
<Kandarihu> Well, I guess my enthusiasm for L4D dropped enough that I'm dropping this.
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> Shizuka: dat almost slip
<Shizuka> 13frozen synapse is a deep game if that's your plan b, wish i didn't fall out of it
<Shizuka> 13my brain has been too scrambled lately to support strategizing
<Reikim> frozen synapse also has a glorious OST.
<Shizuka> 13^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Reikim> I haven't even played the game and I know this.
<Shizuka> 13imma put more of that on after simcity gets out of the way
<Kandarihu> I'll go for Knights of the Old Republic for now, and see about recharging my Steam Wallet tomorrow, before Frozen Synapse's discount expires.
<Reikim> ...I give up on writing. Shizu's music just makes it impossible.
<Polydunami> Dang, those Pirates actually have a winning season for once.
<Reikim> In a good way.
<Kandarihu> If someone would be willing to give me a complimentary copy, I'd be easily able to afford the DLC.
<Kandarihu> And the OST
<Shizuka> 13sorry... if it makes you feel better i have to drop over to a thunderstorm track to get focused for writing... and i still can't
<Reikim> You buy the music now? :O
<Shizuka> 13thought the OST comes with
<Reikim> Don't worry, your music is good.
<Polydunami> So how about those Astros jumping leagues?
<Shizuka> 13or no wait that's the first copy, the extra is just the game
<Unnr|laptop> The Bastion OST is sooo goood
<Reikim> I'm just not in the right mood for writing, and the music isn't suited to what I'm trying to write.
<Shizuka> 13the red dlc comes with its ost though
<Reikim> And I can't shut off the music, because I'm chalking up a massive list of music to go look at thanks to this.
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Ponies47> :P
<Monotone> back)
<Reikim> Think I'm gonna try some Brawl. Anyone else got a copy of the game and willing to play?
<Phase4> 00,02lol, you cant buy one copy

<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, when you going on uru next?
<Reikim> This track is just causing me to trance out.
<Shamroc> Phase4: what? your buying frozen synapse? nice
<Polydunami> Oh well, I'm not on the web client, so what do I care?
<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc, actually i'm gona see if i cant nick someone elses free copy and just buy the soundtrack and dlc
<Phase4> 00,02i'm much lower on money than i thought i was

<Shizuka> 13these mosquitoes man... they have it in for me...
<Polydunami> I don't even CARE what other people think about the fanbase. They don't like us, that's THEIR problem.
<Pudge> dont forget our UK friends
<kirzstryfe> 8,6well 1) No idea why anyone actually gives a shit about other people that feel the need to look down on someone for something they enjoy; and 2) Love and Tolerate is a line too many people use to hide their own intolerance of others
<Ponies47> YES! I'm going to Six Flags later today! Well it's 12:21 AM here. But anyways I'm gonna be wearing my DJ PON-3 shirt there! ^^
<Reikim> Shizuka: Nah, they just want your blood so they can feed it to their hundreds of babbies who will in turn want your blood to feed their babbies and I'm not helping am I.
<Pudge> Love and tolerate is the brony motto
<RAWRity> huh.
<Pudge> :S
<Shizuka> 13nope they're just going to change their tactics now
<Shizuka> 13they know you're on to them
<RAWRity> So apparently somebody's been trying to use my account today.
<OohShiny> Six Flags?
<OohShiny> there are a ton of Six Flags
<Polydunami> On here, RAWRity?
<Sumica> 00,10love and tolerate was just a counter troll, noting more nothing less
<OohShiny> which one you'll go?

<RAWRity> Polydunami: eeyup. 2 failed attempts at guessing my passward since around noon.

<Reikim> RAWRity: Well at least they're failed attempts.
<OohShiny> nothing onstream rainbow
<Shizuka> 13Pudge: nickserv
<derpy_pony> Sumica: that's the 4chan interpretation. others made more of it
<killerpony7733> Pudge: You register the nick and add a password to it
<OohShiny> just da buffer show
<Pudge> ohh, never knew
<Pudge> how do you do it?
<Reikim> Erm. Can we skip on the debates about our fanbase's core meaning?
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
*Shizuka 13is going to go get halfway through a rifftrax then bed

*Nittany_Discord 11,01gets sucked into therainbowvortex
<killerpony7733> Reikim: I know the feel
<Ponies47> The bucking chat crashed agian. My dads computer sometimes -_-

<lowfn>
<Pudge> yay i'm registered
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Get me out of this vortex!
<OohShiny> I notice that there is less oxygen and more carbon oxide in this room every time I breath
<Reikim> Sometimes I sit up and I can feel time flowing right past me. Slipping away like butter between my fingers, now becoming a moment ago, the future becoming the past without me having done anything significant.
*killerpony7733 pulls Nittany_Discord out of the vortex

<Sumica> 00,10they need to put the theme up then
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah
<Vordox> Pinkie's song was too much "BAM BAM BAM" no finess D:
<therainbowvortex> was that oc drawn by hand
<CrimsonPhoenix> The_Browncoat, what oc?
<OohShiny> it wasn't
<Reikim> I love this song, and Twilight's Sonata, the song it's (partially) based off of.
<CrimsonPhoenix> therainbowvortex,**
<OohShiny> it's sprites
<Sumica> 00,10if you count a hand on a mouse then yes
<therainbowvortex> the one with the green mane
<SaxyPretender> 0,14love this part
<OohShiny> it's sprites
<CrimsonPhoenix> oooh
<Reikim> That brass
<therainbowvortex> was it drawn by hand
<CrimsonPhoenix> spriteart
<Ponies47> SaxyPretender: IKR?
<Reikim> That brass section kicks me in the balls every time
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah usually they are mouse made
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, it's based off At The Gala and has a snippet of the mane theme
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> epicepicepicepicepic
<CrimsonPhoenix> for pixelprecision
<OohShiny> Twilight Have a Freakin Kamehameha on the game.
<Vordox> i'm loving this teheme
<Vordox> so playful<3
<emangamer> Sumica: was this made with instruments or computer?
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda like rbd88's songs better
<CrimsonPhoenix> computer
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: Also this song is partially based off of Twilight's Sonata, IIRC
<CrimsonPhoenix> obviously
<Ponies47> If I go to Cantorlot Gardens. I hope to try out Fighting is Magic ^^
<Vordox> Okay, let's see how Rarity's song is.
<Chachamuffin> ;)
<panda> Sumica: i love you ^^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same, Sumica
<Polydunami> Is this the official song?
<OohShiny> yes
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Reikim> I don't recognize this
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, this is Rarity's theme
<Reikim> Oh there it is
<CrimsonPhoenix> chills
<panda> Carousel Boutique, Best song in the game ;)
<Sumica> 00,10they are all from mane6's youtube page
<Vordox> So far, Pinkie was about 4/10, Rarity here have...whoa, Suspence and build up. O.o So far so good, and Twi theme fits her, playful but gentle <3 7/10 for Twi.
<Vordox> Let's see Rarity
<OohShiny> Rarity's Music have to be stylish
<Reikim> It's very...dunno how to describe it...
<crazypony> love this song
<Polydunami> Why does this song remind me so much of the mine theme from DKC2?
<Reikim> Like the smooth blade of a sharp knife
<lowfn> 11/10 for Twi's theme
<sub06905> Twilight/10
<Sumica> 00,10this has a touhou feel
<Vordox> I'm liking this, Very Touhouish.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Indeed Sumica
<therainbowvortex> i was told yesterday that the green pony was an oc
<Ponies47> Muffin/10 for Twilights :3
<Polydunami> For me, it's the same key, actually xD
<OohShiny> twilight is Over9000/10
<Reikim> Sumica: That's probably why I'm loving it so hard.
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: I loved Donkey Kong Country
<CrimsonPhoenix> art of the dress
<CrimsonPhoenix> right there
<OohShiny> What would be fluttershy's one?
<lowfn> Reikim thats disgusting
<Sumica> 00,10Corect therainbowvortex it is an OC
<Vordox> It's kinda orientic....nto sure it fits Rarity
<Reikim> Sumica: Although actually, Twilight's theme is a bit closer to modern Touhou
<Vordox> It's good, but for a theme song..
*sub06905 loves Uncharted 3's theme
<Vordox> Too Neoish?
<Reikim> lowfn: What?
<OohShiny> It fits, because it's stylish
<Polydunami> Orientic? Oriental?
<devsfar> Hey, since when is posting a video that was on Equestria Daily considered spoilers, and results in a 24 hour ban?
<Yahooz> Ah, the FiM themes
<lowfn> Idk
<therainbowvortex> was it drawn by hand or a oc maker
<Sumica> 00,10this realy reminds me of an old super ness game
<hen3ry> since... 72 hours ago I think?
<Vordox> therainbowvortex: You can't "Oc maker" sprites
<Sumica> 00,10cant recall the name but they used it alot on Nick arcade
<Vordox> YES
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the one we all heard of
<OohShiny> this one is just awesome
<Vordox> <3 AJ's SONG is best!
<killerpony7733> devsfar: Cause some do not want to see anything of S3 till it is officially going to air
<Yahooz> This theme XD
<Ponies47> Applejack! :)
<panda> Yeeeeeeeehaww!
<Reikim> I still like AJ's.
<Sylandest> There's my AJ!
<Polydunami> Since some ponies don't want to be spoiled, devsfar?
<derpy_pony> redneck
<Vordox> So "Farmish" <<3
<sub06905> dat applejack theme
<Chachamuffin> :[
<Reikim> Banjo and electric guitar. Did not expect it to work so well.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14love this one too
<Syn_Virtu> i really like this theme
<CrimsonPhoenix> also Applejack is noob friendly
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the breakdown is really god
<Polydunami> Am I right?
<lowfn> At first I was like da faq? But now AJ's theme is good
<Devon> ...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*good
<derpy_pony> applejack doesn't work without her banjo
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> YEAH APPLEJACK, WOOOHOOO
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the handclap part is also great
<Devon> First to guess what username I usually go by on here gets a pony!
<lowfn> Id give 7/10 for AJ
<Vordox> So yeah
<Yahooz> meh, god is suitable
<Yahooz> ish
<lowfn> Is it Devon, Devon?
<Devon> lowfn: Nope.
<Polydunami> Didn't realize banjo worked so well in a rocking beat like this? Well, you've obviously never played Blast Corps :3
<Sumica> 00,10it's easy when I look at who has been baned for 24hours in the last day
<Mutterguy> Dun think Applejack has had her own song yet, right?
<Yahooz> devsfar
<lowfn> Applejack?
<sub06905> Engineer is playing the banjo part
<Yahooz> amirite Devon?
<Vordox> So far, PInkie at 4/10, Twi at 7/10, Rarity(Although unfiting) scores a high 7.8/10, AJ theme is around 7.1/10
<Reikim> We're rating this now?
<Vordox> Personal rating :p
<Devon> I'll give you a hint: The alt of that username is the name of Twilght Sparkle's "daughter"
<Reikim> I like the strings
<OohShiny> Vordox always rates
<Reikim> The strings part is amazing
<Reikim> That fiddle gets me every time.
<Yahooz> Devon: devsfar
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Nyx?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I hate when vordox rate
<OohShiny> he rated the anthology 2 for celestia's sake
<Vordox> Dat offbeat clap
<lowfn> Pinkie - 6/10 ||| Twilight - 10/10 ||| Rarity - 9/10 ||| AJ - 7/10
<Devon> SaxyPretender: You correctly guessed the alt I use when I somehow get disconnected. Now, what is the username I usually use?
<Yahooz> Devon: devsfar
<Yahooz> Now give me that cookie
<Reikim> Aaaand fade
<Devon> Yahooz: No, that's not it. That's my old AOL account login.
<Polydunami> Something about Sammy?
<Reikim> Mmmm yes this
<CrimsonPhoenix> not in FIM
<lowfn> HELL YEA
<Sylandest> Octavia's in this? wow!
<Yahooz> Octavias theme?
<panda> not in FIM but...
<OohShiny> that's not official anyway
<panda> wait
<Reikim> Dem bombastic strings
*Mutterguy suddenly thinks of the blue and white striped teaware
<Yahooz> interesting
<Vordox> INb4 Octavia is added to MLPFIM
<Vordox> Erm
<Devon> Hint: second half of it is everyone's favorite turtle-killing plumber
<Polydunami> ...
<Vordox> FightMagic
<panda> Sumica: playing VS's next right? ;)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, of course eventually
<valoreins|Drawing> kingdom hearts pony!
<Yahooz> mario_pony
<Ponies47> Sounds alot like Rainbow Factory at the start! :o
<lowfn> Octavia is my 2nd favorite pony
<Yahooz> oh wait second half
<scottish-geeky> hello evry pony ohhhhh octavia
<CrimsonPhoenix> You don't think only the mane 6 will be in there right?
<OohShiny> octavia is not confirmed to be in MLP Fighting is magic
<Sumica> 00,10wondered how many would think she was in Mand6
<Ponies47> Hey scottish-geeky
<Sumica> 00,10Mane6*
<Reikim> Actually, Octavia is not likely to be in FightMagic
<Vordox> Sumica: You know, could you show a game that also is Indie vs? :D Touhou 12.3
<sub06905> ello scottish-geeky
<Devon> And the first half is a cartoon character that always wears a hat and has the same VA as one of the Flim-Flam brothers
<scottish-geeky> hia Ponies47
<MahBoi777> hey scottish-geeky!
<Vordox> One video only
<Mutterguy> only in their hearts
<Yahooz> she isnt thus far
<derpy_pony> the coconut pony
<lowfn> If Octavia says something in the show and become canon she will become my favorite pony
<Yahooz> this is just a battle theme
<scottish-geeky> ello sub06905
<Yahooz> nothing in particulae
<Sumica> 00,10I have done tohou LP's before
<Yahooz> *particular
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fighting is Magic will have 17 characters, but so far only the Mane6 have been revealed
<scottish-geeky> hia MahBoi777
<Reikim> Mane6 claims their character list was set in stone before S1 ended, so it's pretty much impossible that OCty's going to be in.
<derpy_pony> octavia is the only pony I have I little figure of on my desk
<Sumica> 00,10I gave up cause KB for a fighting game hurts
<Devon> lowfn: According to the MLP panel and Comic Con, she'll have a duet with Rarity
<Reikim> Sumica: Ooh, which ones?
<Devon> *at Comic Con
<CrimsonPhoenix> Reikim, do you have the list?
<Yahooz> SaxyPretender: Steriods Pony better be unlockable XD
<Vordox> Sumica: Well I mean just cause it's also a indie fightng game. :)
<emangamer> Devon: spoiler much?
<lowfn> Devon, will her name be said?
<Mutterguy> at any rate it's sometimes fanon that she's Pinkiepie's sister
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Reikim> CrimsonPhoenix: No, but Octy only appeared at the end of S1. Thus, Octy cannot appear in FightMagic.
<OohShiny> why I love string instruments?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah, but it still hurts my arm
<Ponies47> brb
<CrimsonPhoenix> She did appear in Season 1 though
<Devon> Mutterguy: Only people who mistake her for Inkie/Binkie, whichever one is the dark gray one.
<Sumica> 00,10I would have to find my kikijoy adaptor so I could use my ps2 controler
<Vordox> Sumica: A video alone. :P
<Polydunami> Devon, there's nothing to be said about whatever is revealed at any conventions.
<Vordox> Oooh
<Yahooz> Octy also appeared in Season two
<Reikim> CrimsonPhoenix: At the end, after Mane6 came up with their list.
<Vordox> Controller for PC <3
<Polydunami> Nothing O_O
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm not saying she's definitely in but rather that she had more chance than the rest of the cast
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> Sumica: why not a gamepad
<Devon> So, you guys give up on getting that pony?
<lowfn> Devon will octavia's name be said?!
<CrimsonPhoenix> has**
<Sumica> 00,10cause ps2 controler I have
<Polydunami> lowfn, let it be a surprise
<lowfn> FRAK
<panda> Sumica: I could give ya mine ^^
<Reikim> CrimsonPhoenix: "The roster was been planned far before S2 started to air."
<Sumica> 00,10besides I dont play fighteres enough to warent having one
<Devon> I'll bet you guys $5 that Cadence will return, and that Twilight and Spike will sing a song together
<Spectrum_Rush|shrugs> fair nough
<Sumica> 00,10at least not till m6
<Ponies47> back :P
<panda> ah... haha well i bought one and havent used it XD

<Polydunami> You're on, Devon :3

<Chachamuffin> :'(
<Devon> The only fighting games I play are SSB, Soul Calibur, and FiM
<Reikim> CrimsonPhoenix: It's in the FAQ, under Characters, specifically asking about S2 ponies.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Ponies47> sub06905: Thanks mate :3
<Yahooz> SSB eh?
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause it could be after season 1 but before season 2

<Vordox> "Puttin' on the Ritz" is a popular song written and published in 1929 by Irving Berlin and introduced by Harry Richman in the musical film Puttin' on the Ritz (1930). The title derives from the slang expression "putting on the Ritz", meaning to dress very fashionably. The expression was inspired by the swanky Ritz Hotel.Can also be an adjective: "ritzy", meaning elegant, dapper; dressing well or putting on airs.

<OohShiny> cops means cops
<sonicdude558> parkour baby
<ACS13123> Metal gear? :P
<ponibas> parkour is fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> Future was a really popular fantasy in the 90s
<OtakuTom> The term COP is an acronym for "Constable on Patrol"
<sonicdude558> da faq
<Vordox> Destroyed City Property, legit?
<Eddmario> Is that the Doctor Who theme in the background?
<Kandarihu> I was sheltered from the more violent cartoons when I was young. And I pretty much stuck with the PBS Kids block for way too long.
<[SWAG]Haku> watcha gonna do watcha gonna do when they come for you
<Polydunami> The More You Know

<[SWAG]Haku> Oh I like this
<Mutterguy> Holy shit! ninjas!!!
<sonicdude558> dat animation
<OohShiny> I love GO!
<ponibas> uhh, where was that knife?
<panda> uh Sumica....
<hen3ry> Filler. Believe it.
<Rohan> Naruto counterpart of galo sengen?
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: Nope.avi. :P
<scottish-geeky> oh gwad i wached this all the time when i was a biig naruto fan
<sonicdude558> yay
<MahBoi777> so beautiful TT_TT
<OohShiny> ah no
<Vordox> Dat Hinata XD
<Polydunami> I never was a big fan of Naruto...
<OohShiny> its Hakuna Kanata
<Eddmario> Admit it, who here only watched Naruto for that sexy naked chick thing he could do?
<OohShiny> or something
<OohShiny> like that
<ponibas> Polydunami, I still don't like it
<sonicdude558> I neber watched naruto
<[SWAG]Haku> Say what you want about the actual show, but some of the thinsg naruto fans make can be pretty awesome
<Rohan> Do they still make episodes? I haven't seen any airings in a while.
<Ponies47> Ok the chat keeps crashing. I'm gonna restart this computer -_-
<ponibas> so many better animes out there
<pony_5104> I prefer the manga
<CrimsonPhoenix> Eddmario, I was legitimately interested in naruto at season 1
<Polydunami> And then there's this.
<CrimsonPhoenix> well before shippuden
<OohShiny> HARUKA KANATA!
<OtakuTom> I've got friends that like it, so I decided to check it out. It's not bad, but the extreme fanbase really turns me off from it.
<sonicdude558> Pokemon anyone?
<Eddmario> Same here CrimsonPhoenix
<Polydunami> I dropped the manga.
<hen3ry> there's something like 900 episodes I think.
<hen3ry> two series
<Mutterguy> Ponies47 look at getting your own client
<Vordox> YES
<Vordox> My favourite
<OohShiny> this is GO!
<OohShiny> this music is awesome
<Vordox> Fiiighting dreaaamers
<Rohan> wat
<scottish-geeky> i uestd to be a big fan but it just got boring after a whiell
<sonicdude558> THis music is 10x more popular than other one
<[SWAG]Haku> Rohan They no longer dub them as far as I know. The original ended in america, and then Disney XD began airing Shippuden. It didnt last long. But the show is still going strong in Japan
<ponibas> hewwo
<Polydunami> One Piece is my favourite out of the "big three" shounen animes.
<Rohan> naic
<OtakuTom> The original TV series went 220 episodes, and the 2nd series is at 267.
<Vordox> LOL Neji XD
<OohShiny> I prefer Bleach
<hen3ry> OtakuTom: So I only doubled the total with my sarcastic assertion. That's... scary.
<panda> O_o
<Vordox> OohShiny: Bleach is ending cause it's unwanted :P
<ponibas> Blood+ is also good
<scottish-geeky> OtakuTom: and thats why i found it boring aftter a whiel to long
<sonicdude558> shake ur booty
<OohShiny> vordox
<Vordox> LAWL JIRAYA
<Vordox> XD
<OohShiny> bleach continues
<OohShiny> in manga
<[SWAG]Haku> Kisame was always my favorite from the Akasuki
<cratorkid> why do anime girls always have huge boobs?
<scottish-geeky> ponibas: Blood+ is awesome
<Vordox> OohShiny: No, it's final arc
<sonicdude558> dat naruto
<Kandarihu> Combining Naruto and Shippuden, that would be 489 episodes so far.
<pony_5104> bleach, naruto and one piece are just way too long and anime has too much crappy filler eps
<ponibas> story's gotta end eventually
<Polydunami> Yeah, I liked Bleach but I got bored of it during the Deicide arc.
<OohShiny> Vordox
<OohShiny> I read
<CrimsonPhoenix> you know
<OohShiny> the manga
<Rohan> c:
<xxMoopyxx> im watching the longest video everypony
<ponibas> scottish-geeky, fek yes it is
<sonicdude558> How many of these parodys r they?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think I could watch the first series no problem
<Vordox> OohShiny: I've read manga and I've read them over 15 years now
<scottish-geeky> ponibas: have you seen hell girl
<Vordox> OohShiny: Bleach is on it's final arc.
<OohShiny> it is
<[SWAG]Haku> I ship NaruHina
<CrimsonPhoenix> If I ignore Shippuden and the one after
<OtakuTom> Vordox: Bleach ended because they didn't want to make more filler while waiting for the final arc to finish in the manga. It's unknown if the anime will continue once the manga finishes.
<ponibas> nope
<OohShiny> but it will last a lot
<panda> Sumica: XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can say Naruto is good
<panda> why the hell you so random?
<OohShiny> because the arrancar saga lasted 5 years or so
<Vordox> OtakuTom: Indeed
<Shamroc> ahaha

<CrimsonPeach> I really need to watch that
<TheRandomkid321> HELLO! SO who be streamin?
<pony_5104> is he a wizard?
<Eddmario> Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who
<PearDox> [SWAG]Haku: The context that is, Luigi getting possessed, Bowser teaming up(Unknowingly), and Peach is kidnapped.
<PolyDurian> Doctor Who is pretty good.
<Tomato_Rush|shrugs> sumi title plox
<prince-dari> Eddmario: You don't say.jpg

<Kandarihu> Anyway, Wrek has his own OC Desktop Pony, a yellow pony painting a picture of Twilight Sparkle. Phase4 has an OC, a Blue Pony launching rockets that keep exploding. And also looking at an IRC window.
<Eddmario> MLP is the reason I got into Doctor Who
<CrimsonPeach> GHOSTBUSTER

<OohShiny> o.o
<Eddmario> INB4 the electricity hits his uncovered hand
<cratorkid> why is that guy wearing a trash can?
<[SWAG]Haku> Heres the idea: Luigi gets possessed and takes the mushrrom kingdom from bowser, forcing the two to ACTUALLY team up, not unknowingly team up. They are then banished to some outer border of the mushroom kingdo, and must work together(The whole game is them togetehr at all times) and must take back the koopa kingdom from Luigi, who is a much more terrifying kind than Bowser ever was.
<kiwibas> owww.. if you're gonna zoom that close. get a tripod
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cratorkid: for reasons
<Sumica> 00,10vordox, this is the one
<lowfn> cratorkid: For protection from the electricity
<PearDox> cratorkid: Eletrcity attracts to pure metals

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> fluttershy did the flyby: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/342/6/c/flyby_by_braindps-d4ii2pc.jpg

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> day ban?
<sub06905> yup
<alexxm> well he's gone then
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cant tell if ban or did a runby
<alexxm> why not both
<derpy_pony> this explains the wave 4 blind bag pony design
<Quick_Thinker> hey guys im gonna be starting my first ever drawing for my cover for the fic My Little Pony Day Z is Magic
<Quick_Thinker> wish me luck and give me tips if possible
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> key
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> kay
<AdamTheDuck> yay zombies
<sub06905|Uncharted> :3
<Quick_Thinker> seriously any tips will be appriciated i have never drawn before on a computer
<AdamTheDuck> it would be interesting to watch your sketches :3
<OtakuTom> Are you using a mouse or a tablet, Quick_Thinker?
<derpy_pony> use gimp. and some program I forgot for vector stuff. look for pony drawing tutorials on google. there should be around 3 billions of them around
<Quick_Thinker> well im using my labtop to wrie
<shana> inkscape?
<derpy_pony> yes
<derpy_pony> thanks
<OtakuTom> But yea, derpy_pony is right. GIMP is a great program to use, and Inkscape is great for vectors.
<Quick_Thinker> and the pic is gonna take a lot of work but my god do i hope it turns out great
<derpy_pony> don't expect too much if you have no experience at all. it will take some time
<Quick_Thinker> i know i think it will be done next year
<OtakuTom> Yea, that's the other thing. Even if you've drawn a lot on paper, you'll have to practice again to get back into the swing of things on a computer.
<Quick_Thinker> i dont draw on paper in fact im a shitty drawer as it goes but im not gonna ask some pony on devian art to do it for me so i want to do this myself
<Quick_Thinker> i have a feeling people are reading that comment and facepalmed simoutaniously
<AdamTheDuck> no not really, i know a few people who constantly challenges themselves
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Very_Silly_Filly
<alexxm> hey Very_Silly_Filly how've you been
<Quick_Thinker> well yeah challenge themselves but this is down right artistic sucide so its gonna be a bitch
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kinda pshyched actually
<Quick_Thinker> its gonna take at least a year to get the backgorund down
<Very_Silly_Filly> Just came back upstairs to find 20 sec left before windows update restarts my PC
<Very_Silly_Filly> If it restarted, I'da lost loads of work
<AdamTheDuck> no autosave?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nope
<Very_Silly_Filly> Windows XP doesn't have that, nor does the program
<AdamTheDuck> well depends on the work, Microsoft word always make a save before it shuts down
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wasn't on MS word, it was on a different pogram
<Very_Silly_Filly> and I knew it wouldn't save it because it's happened before
<AdamTheDuck> and aren't some programming whatchamacallits automatically save too?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Playing a full screen game. and the bastard doesn't tell you it's gonna restart
<sub06905|Uncharted_3> lol
<AdamTheDuck> i'm using visual basic so that saves i think
<Very_Silly_Filly> You only have to happen to look to find OSHI, it's gonna go!
<Lil_B> yes, I made the idle animation for my own Desktop Pony <3
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wish I could sprite :c
<Quick_Thinker> i could if i knew how to
<Quick_Thinker> but dont XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can draw a few things and shade them, but I can't draw much besides
<Quick_Thinker> should learn
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'll show you the best work I can do
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm

<Jim> Your 10 year old relative would probably like the ponies
<ACS13123> or you could try the brony conversion program twi_sprinkle_GS17

<ACS13123> twi_sprinkle_GS17: ok then
<MegaMoonShine> Helloooooo?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> RobertRevenge: because kids his age are less likely to like the show because they arent adult enough to fight stereotypes
<shadowprince116> serp
<RobertRevenge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Not entirely true. I run a boy scout troop filled with bronies from ages 11-16. o-o

<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: Silver is even moreso.
<Jim> RobertRevenge, Are you implying there are more than one generation of pokemon?
<Quick_Thinker> where the hell did Twi learn the memory spell?
<Chocobunny> RobertRevenge: I like Red more than Silver.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> hoi Cypresswolf
<derpy_pony> they all look the same
<ACS13123> Awesuumms
<oni_link> burn!!!
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: So do I, but Silver took down Red like a baws.

<Cypresswolf> Everything is Awesome in Cloudsdale
<Lil_B> shoot her with injection needles
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> applejack tried to turn rarity gray
<RobertRevenge> Jim: Yes. Yes I am. The adorableness of g5 pokemon calls to me.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I moved out of Cloudsdale becuase I was too awesome for it
<derpy_pony> laaag
<oni_link> that cloud hug :D
<Chocobunny> RobertRevenge: You know that Silver is the red-head in Johto, right? The one you're talking about is Gold.
<Cypresswolf> Nimbus AWAY
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> she shouldve just ruined their ballon
<Jim> 5 generations of pokemon? ImGettingTooOldForThisShit.jpg
<Chocobunny> ^^
<Very_Silly_Filly> Jim: Ikr

<Cypresswolf> Pinkie Pie: I did secure the rope - Rarity:to the BALLOON - Pinkie: Oops :3
<ACS13123> RAGE!!!!!!!
<Chocobunny> LUGIA IS THE BEST.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> so NOW its easy to get her angry.
<Twily> applejack and her ropes...
<oni_link> I still take Mewtwo over Lugia
<Twily> also hi
<ekips> o u, Twily
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Salamence is best pokemon
<MegaMoonShine> hi Twily :)
<oni_link> hello Twily
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Now Rainbow Dash, where did she touch you?
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^Lol
<nipa_> bulbasaur rulez
<alexxm> house of cards
<RobertRevenge> oni_link: I never liked Mewtwo, it was too OP for it's time.
<Chocobunny> ^^
<Twily> insert rushed ending here
<Cypresswolf> *Wilhelm Scream*
<Very_Silly_Filly> Haha
<ACS13123> Dat Sound effect
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<oni_link> RobertRevenge: And Lugia isnt?
<Lil_B> Chaos~Friendship
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Twi is godlike
<valoreins> sopa vs internets
<Quick_Thinker> magic seems to be a tad better then friendshiop
<derpy_pony> $10 on chaos. evil always wins
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Mewtwo has higher stats than Lugia iirc
<Jim> internets win, fatality
<sub06905|Uncharted_3> Twilight is OP
<RobertRevenge> oni_link: g2 was when the Legendaries stopped being OP when they became part of the story. Lugia prioritizes defense and special defense over attack/special attack and speed anyways.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> apple power!
<Kencolt> Twilight is meant to be OP. Morning, all.
<MegaMoonShine> Laser light show rave!
<Jim> morning Kencolt
<Lil_B> these sounds remind me of Starfox 64

<MegaMoonShine> Anti-hate shields online
<Very_Silly_Filly> alexxm: Over 2 rainbows? :)
<oni_link> Does that hold true now in G5 though? Older legendairies now are hella strong.
<Lil_B> I find it funny that a similar thing with rainbows also destroyed the Villian in G1
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> and celestia did nothing. again.
<Cypresswolf> Derpy!

<Cypresswolf> I've gone back to watch this series so many times - I focus more on whats going on in the background more often - if only to come up with more bingo options

<cow334> Hello every one.....Moo
<alexxm> i'm good cow334 how about you
<oni_link> Earth, they live on it O.O
<Kencolt> Awkward.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> they really need to be more aware of their surroundings
<Quick_Thinker> there is a flag in pinkies hat true story
<cow334> alexxm: I'm doing awesome
<RobertRevenge> oni_link: Of course :D
<cow334> thanks for asking
<Lil_B> I loved the Timing in that scene
<alexxm> how did they not notice each other
<Cypresswolf> Pinkie Pie - Time Lord
<Quick_Thinker> low hanging cloud
<derpy_pony> they live on future earth. humanity went extrinct millenia ago
<derpy_pony> -r
<Quick_Thinker> okay now the question is how did they travel to find Equestria?
<Jim> Weirdly, I'm OK with that
<Quick_Thinker> how far sorry
<Twily> heh
<otakon17> Quick_Thinker: No idea
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: Possibly very very far
<Cypresswolf> Get on with it!
<otakon17> Bye cow334_gone
<RobertRevenge> Colgate seems upset
<oni_link> yes, get on with it!!!!!!
<Quick_Thinker> so there are other places other then Equestria to our knowledge and it seems their is no oceans
<alexxm> get on with it
<oni_link> alexxm: /)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> dat Rarity :D
<alexxm> (\ oni_link
<MegaMoonShine> I gotta go now guys
<RobertRevenge> Take care MegaMoonShine
<Quick_Thinker> (\
<MegaMoonShine> Later :)
<otakon17> Quick_Thinker: Apparently
<oni_link> bye MegaMoonShine
<otakon17> Bur MegaMoonShine
<otakon17> Bye*
<Cypresswolf> Puddinghead was clever enough to get the side with the exit :3 Clearly Puddinghead is best leader
<dshannon> Tom?
<Quick_Thinker> so that means Equestria is a just a land not the enitre planet
<Kencolt> It's just a rock. A dumb rock.
<oni_link> Cypresswolf: Indeed :3
<Taeguk> :S
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> puddinghead was stupid enough to invade another country <.<
<RobertRevenge> Kencolt: It's Tom as a filly.
<otakon17> Quick_Thinker: Eeyup
<Quick_Thinker> and if just a land other nations have go to be out there possibly even humans
<Kencolt> RobertRevenge: You mean colt.
<alexxm> RobertRevenge or his ancestor
<Cypresswolf> We're Trap-ped :O
<otakon17> Ya Tom is all man
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: Sadly we have no actual canon explanation of the origins of how the world looks
<otakon17> Er stallion
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> THEY WERE FROZEN TODAY
<sub06905|Uncharted_3> ded
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> WINticos
<sub06905> windagos
*RobertRevenge dances around the fire chanting.
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: However theres one very good fanon map that is based off known information
*sub06905 puts out fire
<Very_Silly_Filly> Haters gonna hate
<Quick_Thinker> so from my idea of the land and the map its located in South America or someplace with the same geography
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> funny, fluttershy was the only one to express hate/severe dislike
<oni_link> i daww'd
<derpy_pony> you are not even of the same color, ponies!
<sub06905> dat OP twilight
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> moral of the story: friendship is nice, but giant pillars of flame are nicer
<ACS13123> GG NO RE
<Malavolent> twi_sprinkle_GS17: I lol'd
<alexxm> and the wendigos were burned alive
<derpy_pony> fire magic ftw!
<oni_link> Twilight learned Firaga
<Quick_Thinker> and the idea of it being in a land with mountains surrounding it is a very isolated land could be greece maybe but then again they have oceans
<sub06905> fire is now powered by friendship
<Cypresswolf> Equestria is a very dangerous place - creatures that destroy civilizations that turn to anger and hate, dragons rule the skies, timberwolves and other foul creatures rule the forests, and who knows what manner of creature lies under their hooves
<derpy_pony> this is how the friendship bunny fires started
<sub06905> ^
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Cypresswolf: ikr. but nobody ever dies
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> one of bvest songs time
<oni_link> seriously
<Quick_Thinker> what was the old land called?
<adasdad> ...and then celstia came and took over.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i<3 that song
<sub06905> dat sync
<otakon17> Cypresswolf: Well said
<otakon17> Quick_Thinker: Old land
<oni_link> adasdad: indeed :D
<Cypresswolf> twi_sprinkle_GS17: but then, what happened to the ponies of generations before?
<Quick_Thinker> good one
<derpy_pony> one of the least remixed songs
<somepony_else> hello everypony :)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i wish they made an extended version of the song
<Lil_B> this song is so short :(
<Jim> hey somepony_else
<sub06905> ello somepony_else
<derpy_pony> hi somepony_else
<oni_link> hello somepony_else
<WG> Hi somepony_else
<killerpony7733> Quick_Thinker: Fanon made map has names of what is assumed as the different lands things originate from
<alexxm> hey somepony_else how've you been
<Lil_B> hi somepony_else
<cow334_gone> hello somepony_else
<WG> waaat
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Cypresswolf: they die of age, but i mean they dont die of dangers
*somepony_else hugs everypony
<otakon17> Eeyup
<otakon17> Hiya somepony_else
<adasdad> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<oni_link> yay
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Cypresswolf: there was a scene with a tomb
<otakon17> Wb cow334
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> aw
<cow334> otakon17: woohoo
<otakon17> twi_sprinkle_GS17: Funeral
<Very_Silly_Filly> DO HO HIO
<Quick_Thinker> okay so the idea that this is earth and Equestria would be located in a place surrounded by mountains and no ocean in sight
<Twily> YAAY
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> one of best eps imo
<Cypresswolf> Fluttershy does mention dragons can (and more then likely do) eat ponies
<Cypresswolf> in Dragonshy
<adasdad> ...so the only reason equestria is so nice is ecause it's constantly threatened by hate-eating monsters? 0.o
<Malavolent> Quick_Thinker: Suits surpsrisingly well for my country.
<oni_link> Cypresswolf: indeed
<WG> MLP could use a little more blood
<derpy_pony> there are seaponies
<WG> :D
<Phase4> WG, wat
<otakon17> adasdad: Ponies not only survive but THRIVE
<WG> norhing
<WG> just came on
<WG> :D
<cow334> Well today I saw a video of my little pony season three and they where talking about crystal ponys now I need some help has any one even seen how a crystal pony looks like
<ACS13123> WG: My little pony? THATS A KIDS SHOW, IT CANNOT HAVE BLOOD HURR DURR RAWR
<Cypresswolf> come to think of it, I dont think FIM has introduced a creature from the ocean
<sub06905> MLP needs moar Derpy
<otakon17> cow334: SPOILERS!
<Cypresswolf> *adds to bingo game*
<Quick_Thinker> well from this idea if they ever encouter an ocean at some point they would not be able to traverse it easily due to not needing boats to our knowledge at least
<derpy_pony> one day a pony got bitten by a radioactive spider. 28 days later the last human died. a pony bit his head off
<otakon17> Lol
<Jim> Needs more sea ponies
<cow334> otakon17: wait what O-O
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> well, now i need to think of a different ep for BMN
<WG> ACS13123 : They could say it's jam. No one would suspect a thing :D
<otakon17> cow334: Dude, you can get banned for that
<sub06905> ^
<ACS13123> WG: They'd figure it out :/
<littlemac> whats next on the list
<Phase4> 00,02and thats enough pony for now
<cow334> otakon17: oh .... I didnt know that sorry
<otakon17> twi_sprinkle_GS17: This doesn't count against it.
<derpy_pony> they have airships
<cow334> who is streaming?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> thanks Phase4 !
<otakon17> cow334: Have you read the rules?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, no spoilers
<derpy_pony> thanks for the stream, phase4 :)
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> otakon17: ik, btu we just watched it
*Phase4 00,02wants to wait for s3
<Quick_Thinker> okay so from the idea that it is no where near an ocean and surrounded by mountains its in a land that is fertile among other things
<ACS13123> NO SPERLERS!
<WG> ACS13123 : Well I only saw 2 episodes anyway lol
<Jim> no spelunking
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> otakon17: although i love that ep so i might vote for it anyway, plus i never win either way :I
<cow334> otakon17: yes I have I just thought that since the episode hasnt came yet it would be okay to say it well i was wrong then sorry
<Quick_Thinker> im going that Equestria is in America or Europe
<Unnr> Phase4, not even the koeningsegg with top gear spoiler?
<WG> ACS13123 : IT's already like a happy end
<alexxm> thanks for teh stream Phase4
<littlemac> what episode was showed?
<sub06905> In that video for season 3 it was all aboot [Must be 20% cooler to read rest of message]
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> damn, i guess i better go equip my +20% coolness item
<cow334> i have to be going bye every one
<otakon17> cow334: Well I say it earlier, but some people don't like to be spoiled is all.
<cow334> all of you all have a nice day]
<WG> bye cow334
<TrixieMuffins> test
<derpy_pony> www.ebay.com/sch/quills_and_sofas/m.html they are selling them for 3 months now, cow334
<littlemac> bye
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> bye cow334
<Quick_Thinker> and so from the idea that it is Europe is very likely they have most of the stuff that would be needed for Equestria to thrive or it could be south of Africa
<WG> I. AM. RARITY!
<otakon17> Bye cow334 take care
<derpy_pony> europa has no deserts
<derpy_pony> it's probably located in australia
<littlemac> no it dosent!
<Quick_Thinker> derpy when do they ever speak of a desert?
<littlemac> deserts
<oni_link> I agree with Phase4, Im one of those people that doesnt look at spoilers so that the experience is fresh and unexpected
<derpy_pony> in the buffalo war episode
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm
<Quick_Thinker> australia is unlikly due to the unfertile land
<Quick_Thinker> not exactly the best for farming
<Phase4> 00,02australia is unlikely due to buffalo
<derpy_pony> over a barrel
<Phase4> 00,02we dont have those here
*Midnight_Tempest snaps his fingers and makes things burst into flames
<WG> Australia could use some bombs
<otakon17> Phase4: You're a aussie?
<derpy_pony> southeastern australia is fine
<Phase4> 00,02otakon17, eyup
<otakon17> Neat
<oni_link> Midnight_Tempest is a flame alchemist :O
*Phase4 00,02is in southeastern aus
<Unnr> Ohai Midnight_Tempest
<Quick_Thinker> so i have the Americas and Europe left after a lot of eleminating for Eqeustria place in say an alternate Dimesnion
<Midnight_Tempest> rawr
<WG> Phase4 : Do you have jarate?
<derpy_pony> intelligent buffalos...maybe they stole a ship
<Phase4> 00,02WG, nope
<littlemac> who is going to stream next?
<otakon17> Phase4: But doesn't everyone down there want you dead?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Phase4: do Kangaroos like to troll roads?
<Phase4> 00,02otakon17, nah, just the spiders
<Unnr> Phase4, and the sheep.
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, no clue where that perception came from, serious or not
<otakon17> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr, them too
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm?
<Quick_Thinker> well its very obvious that the place is either Americas or Europe so would anyone like to help me narrow this down?
<Unnr> Can´t trust the evil little bastards.

<killerpony7733> Ryunosuke: Well it's interesting due to how the studio kinda missed a really good potential to explain origins
<Phase4> 00,02because thats where hasbro is
<WG> Phase4 : So you bronies basically are all about love and tolerance just as in the show?
<derpy_pony> www.ebay.com/sch/quills_and_sofas/m.html this one twi_sprinkle_GS17, I linked it a few minutes ago

<twi_sprinkle_GS17> lol otakon17
<Phase4> 00,02WG, no, was like this before hand
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> brb

<derpy_pony> hi CupcakeExtreme01
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Phase4: ^, dang that was late
<otakon17> pony: I miss the old shows from TechTV
<killerpony7733> Phase4: But what lauren managed to make unique was you can relate to every mane six character in some way, Some side characters too
<pony> yeah that was good old days
<pony> now its all trash
<oni_link> also pony, if you want to ping someone you put a colon next to their name. and to autocomplete someones name, you can use the tab key.
<pony> ok ^^
<Quick_Thinker> well rarity i see no similarty in me as well as AJ but i can be wrong
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, yeah, much better than the generic personalitys in previous gens
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm you know, odd's are bronies never saw Lauren's other shows
<Quick_Thinker> no i have
<Phase4> 00,02i've seen some of them
<oni_link> I saw a bit.
<Quick_Thinker> Foster's Home count?
<Phase4> 00,02have a much greater appreciation for powerpuff girls now
<pony> i made a pony car car on forz 4
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Pretty much, It's just very unique how it makes you able to relate in alot of ways
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> yes
<Quick_Thinker> as well as power puff girls
<Phase4> 00,02but adventure time is not realy for me and havent seen fosters home
<GilDash> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: A lot of the reasons we existed in the first place was *because* we saw Lauren's pervious shows.
<somepony_else> i loved generation 1 when i was small ^^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Phase4: you dont like Adventure Time |0 n 0|
<killerpony7733> I have seen most of laurens cartoons, Though i first realised it was her that made tem until around MLP FIM
<pony> i use to love johnny brivo
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Same here. Realised I liked those ones and thought, "Well, it can't be *that* bad surely." :D
<WG> Why the heck do you need to put ponies in ever single game.. I don't get it
<Phase4> 00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, not realy, it looks fun but just not my kind
<oni_link> Adventure Time is done by Faust?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> no
<derpy_pony> http://dakamus.deviantart.com/art/Brony-Conversations-9-Original-By-Design-314712279
