<PhrozenFire> my Kindness Shy's away.
<CriticKitten> Well, looking over the actual posts, I'm....not surprised it's fake.
<PinkiePieCopy> I DUNOO :'(
<PinkiePieCopy> Truce?

<flutter_spin> just tell me when and what is going to stream. I want to eat!
<Midnight_Tempest> i can do L4D and L4D2... so which is it?
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: we wanted to believe.
<LadyCanary> ...My friend was right! She was in the snowglobe!
<Midnight_Fyre> Shouldn't these sites usually check these guys out before they do something like that? At least in the Jayson Thieson interview on Reddit he proved who he was through his Twitter
<Jaketehsnake> Midnight I only have L4D2 So that will be the one prolly
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<flutter_spin> Naw. I think EQD just posts anything and everything
<Meanwhile> Seriously can anyone else taste salsa?
<DeadpoolDash> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/254/926/c05.gif
<TOY_PON3> I take back what I said about Jayson..I seriously do .__.

<Midnight_Fyre> Which ep is that clip from?

<CriticKitten> Oh wow, the content of some of these posts. My goodness. Gullible isn't strong enough.
<Jaketehsnake> TOY_PON3 Midnight tempest and I are doing L4D2, You should join us!
<Midnight_Tempest> ZOMBIES!
<Jaketehsnake> I trusted the mods! AND NAO THIS!
<Meanwhile> In all honesty, I haven't looked at the actual ponychan thread. I just read the bits on EqD
<TOY_PON3> Jaketehsnake: But PinkiePieCopy doesn't have L4D2 :(
<jffry890> we should watch 300
<Meanwhile> We should dig a moat.
<TOY_PON3> Let me play one game with him then I'll go with you guys
<CriticKitten> Trixie returning should've been an instant tipoff that something was wrong, she's an obvious one-shot character in the same vein as Gilda XD
<Midnight_Tempest> we should all burst into flames
<Jaketehsnake> QUICK! SOMEPONY GIFT PinkiePieCopy L4D2!
<Meanwhile> We should take Bronystate and push it somewhere else!
<Cipher|Homework> 0,14But where?

<jffry890> haha
<Midnight_Tempest> the real world!

<Jaketehsnake> Yes, SOmepony please do it!
<CriticKitten> In the words of Bender: "That's not irony! That's just mean!"
<Meanwhile> It'd be ironic if EQD was Anonymous, but it isn't.

<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: ha!
<ScootaChicken> Saturn: what did you do this time...
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: It fits, considering that EqD was effectively trolled by someone with roughly the same mental capacity as Ashton Kutcher

<Saturn> 08,01albeit, an octave or two lower
<CriticKitten> At least shows like Scare Tactics have an excuse for people buying into their nonsense....people who are afraid don't think rationally. Amazing this wasn't caught before it hit the EqD page. ._.
<Jaketehsnake> No meanwhile mayonaise is not an instrument

<Mutterguy> ?me asks the hat for BLT sandwich with onions
<otakon> TOY_PON3: do you have a mute switch on the headset?
<Saturn> 08,01thouhg... to be honest, my real teaching passion would be music
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, my first class ends at 4, my last class starts at 8
<Ingwaz> well saturn, if you like teaching that much, then might as well gof or that, but if you like physics more, then might be better to get a masters in physics and still be able to teach
*Meanwhile staggers to his feet and flying headbutts otakon.

<RaveBrony> The directors were smart when it came to the 'Hearts and Hooves' episode, and didnt include any of the mane 6 at all! :D (well, barely included)
<The_4th_Wall> It's inappropriate for the intended demographic
<MASF123> RD isn't lesbo, she hides her femenism, but sometimes shows it in a few episodes

<MahBoi777> HOLD IT! what u talkin bout Willis?
*[GOLD]GabeMoist watching Umineko Motion Graphic Vol. 3
<CupcakeWarrior> I thought gelatin was cow hooves?
<flutter_spin> Anyone else find it odd that there is a lack of stallions in Ponyville? Or is it named Ponyville because.... of all the ponies?
<TOY_PON3> SonicRainboom: That's really fucked up once you think about it...
<SonicRainboom> So, everypony that has eaten a cake or cupcake is a canniba-
<SonicRainboom> Shut up.

<SonicRainboom> Mid, wait for me.
*TOY_PON3 glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<SaxyJanitor> 0,14well, generally the lack of stallions can be attributed to the fact it's a girl's show and as such, they don't tend to include many male characters
<meh> maybe they recycle?
<TOY_PON3> :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :3 hai TOY_PON3
<SonicRainboom> Possibly.
<meh> you know what i mean
<Aldag71> :P
<flutter_spin> But seriously, is Big Mac like the only male?
<CupcakeWarrior> Stallions are not attractive
<Aldag71> No
<MahBoi777> it's simple really, half of them were abducteed by aliens for testing.
<SonicRainboom> What about the doctor?
<MASF123> It is a reverse China effect in Equestria. :3
<meh> what about caramel?
<TOY_PON3> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :3
<SonicRainboom> From Secret of My Excess and Read it and Weep?
<Aldag71> There is a war going on, so a lot of the males are gone
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> big mac, caramel, braeburn, soarin, the dr
<meh> what about mr breezy
<flutter_spin> But only Big Mac played a major role
<Midnight_Tempest> there are lots of stallions, just more mares... i find this acceptable
<TOY_PON3> Caramel is a cheater :|
<SonicRainboom> The doctor had a large speaking part in Read it and Weep.
<flutter_spin> Sure Dr. Hooves too
<CupcakeWarrior> Kind of like how there isnt any male NPCs in Hyperdimension Neptunia
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shhh you.. caramel is best pony
<CupcakeWarrior> If any of you guys know that game
<Aldag71> am i the only one that sees a black screen?

Reddit fans become mimics / dopplegangers / bodysnatchers, but are easily spotted and are a minor annoyance at best. 4channers become trolls, divided into various tribes. The xenophobic /b/, the war mongering /v/, and the neutral /co/
<RawketLawnchair> I have been thinking to much about these things
<CupcakeWarrior> Suddenly text

<Mutterguy> I thinki've been on it
*The_4th_Wall has no external :(
<Starflash> Gmorning ponies~
<Kammerjunk> MIDNIGHT: Yeah, I have more than just that 1 TB, but that's what I've reserved for media. Filled 600-700 GB so far.
<xles> Mornin' Starflash.
<Mutterguy> right by the Tate modern
<MIDNIGHT> right now i'm just limited by my internets
<MahBoi777> mornin Starflash!
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<MIDNIGHT> moved into the country and the best thing is phone line DSL @ 1.5mbps
<Kammerjunk> I've actually filled 979 GB so far.
<Sumica> 00,10Placebo framerate and sound quality can change file size alot.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, well.
<MIDNIGHT> freaking stone age internet
<Starflash> Ohai MahBoi777 :3 mfw you're always online
<Placebo> ^
<Sumica> 00,10also if they are mkv's there could be subfiles
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: He's always watching us.
<The_4th_Wall> Torrent ETA is 2 hrs
*SuperBrony64|Zzz glomps Starflash
<MahBoi777> Starflash: LOL ALWAYS
*Starflash glomps SuperBrony64|Zzz
<MIDNIGHT> make sure to get the color corrected S1 :D
<RainbowJack> i have Season 1 on my hard drive and its almost 20 gb
<Mutterguy> wah! wah wah!... move to NZ and then complain....
<Starflash> go to sleep SB :3
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah over 2TB here.
<Placebo> MIDNIGHT: Is that your actual download speed?
<MIDNIGHT> Nah, I usually average 80-120KB/sec
<Placebo> Ah.
<Placebo> was gonna say, that's some DAMN high Dsl.
<Starflash> 2TB? you mad, Sumi? o.o
<MahBoi777> lol
<Mutterguy> I think the household limit for downloads is 60 a month
<The_4th_Wall> my down speed= 1.7 MB/s
<Starflash> 1.5 here -_- I thought that was much
<Mutterguy> *GB
<Kammerjunk> 50 Mbps upload and download here.
<Kammerjunk> I don't really think I need more.
<Phase4> when i have money (hopefully soon) i'ma setup a 4/5 tb fileserver
<MIDNIGHT> Mb is also not the same as MB
<MIDNIGHT> So, 1.5Mbps is =~190KB
<MIDNIGHT> per second
<Spanner-pony> 192KB
<Phase4> MIDNIGHT: ah, the gibibytes vs gigabytes vs gigabits vs AAAAAAAAAAAAA(horrid convetions)
<Placebo> I pay ~50 bucks a month for a 10 Mbps download.
<The_4th_Wall> 1.6MB/s down, 254.8 kB/s up
<Phase4> ~16mbit/s here
<MIDNIGHT> I used to have fancy pants Comcast, 105Mbps
<MIDNIGHT> could download at like 7MB/sec
<Phase4> though i usualy only get 1.2MB/s
<Kammerjunk> My personal tower just has 3 TB because the 1 TB disk contains my Windows installation and I don't feel like re-installing just now.
<Kammerjunk> But I hope to upgrade it soon.
<MIDNIGHT> I blew out my bandwidth limit and TB drives so fast...
<Placebo> S1 looks fine in 420, honestly.. STill think I need the 20 gig download just to show my brony-hood, though.
<MIDNIGHT> when you can download entire series in like, 2 hours... >.>
<Spanner-pony> 1.41Mbps :3
<Sumica> 00,1015 down 2 up here.
<Phase4> after s2 is done i'm going to get 1080 of both seasons and rewatch them
<Kammerjunk> Placebo: I can't accept episodes if they're not 1080p.
<Phase4> Sumica: bits or bytes?
<MIDNIGHT> Comcast sent me angry letters cause I ended up downloading like, 600GB in a month
<MIDNIGHT> which is apparently bad
<Placebo> Dayum
<Sumica> 00,10mbps
<Kammerjunk> MIDNIGHT: Do ho ho.
<Placebo> Surprise they didn't send you an angry copyright lawsuit.lol
<Kammerjunk> My father doesn't really do anything with our Internet but download films and shows.
<MIDNIGHT> encrypt your torrenting! :D
<The_4th_Wall> i'm on a Lenovo G550 laptop, 250 gb HDD, 4096 mb RAM
<Sumica> 00,10glad century link dont give a shit about my usage.
<Phase4> its actualy fine to force encryption on torrents now, bugger all people dont
<Sumica> 00,10I hardly ever close stream or mirc
<MIDNIGHT> I have Century Link, but, when you only have 1.5Mbps... can't always have the stream up :(
<Spanner-pony> My download speed is 0.48Mbps with the stream going...
<xles> ISPs that only care about bills getting paid roughly on time, ftw.
<MIDNIGHT> I can't wait to move back to the city.
<MIDNIGHT> Comcast only cares about usage if you're like, in the top 10 power users for your area
<MIDNIGHT> Cause there have been months where I download only 4-500GB/month, and got no letter.
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda lucked out as I am realy close to a net hub for them.
<Placebo> I had Century link when I lived with my folks.
<Placebo> On Suddenlink now.
<MahBoi777> fancy internetz
*The_4th_Wall is going to close FF soon to streamline torrent
<MIDNIGHT> I'm actually surprised I can handle having both the Stream up and SWTOR running, but, then again it is like 3am
<MIDNIGHT> the moment I try to load a webpage though everything bogs down XD
<Sumica> 00,10Sounds like Mr freeze
<MahBoi777> lol
<xles> Mr Skeez
<Sumica> 00,10I do that all the time MIDNIGHT
<Kammerjunk> I usually have TF2 and WoW running at the same time because I never, ever close anything.
<Starflash> the whole chatroom is talking in computerfancy! =w= oh noes
<Kammerjunk> Hence why I have 100-something tabs open in Firefox.
<MIDNIGHT> I've been spoiled on Comcast
<MIDNIGHT> going back to DSL is like... going back to 56k when broadband first came out :(
<MahBoi777> Starflash: LOL
<Sumica> 00,10moar
<MIDNIGHT> AHMS STRATE
<Starflash> MahBoi777: Its true~ ;a;
<MahBoi777> I know, lol
<Kammerjunk> Well, at least he doesn't consider his ego important.
<RainbowJack> RainBow Dash Seal of 20% cooler
<Sumica> 00,10it's what makes him a funny guy.
<Sumica> 00,10cause he can laugh at himself.
<Kammerjunk> It's fun to laugh at yourself.

<MASF123> Did anypony see this yet?
<xles> SB64 - Sleep-IRCer.
<Mutterguy> except the phrase can apply to any field
<Kammerjunk> "Go the fuck to sleep."
<Kammerjunk> Best children's book ever, by the way.
<Espeon|School> lies.

<Sumica> 00,10I recomend you just lay back and think of england.
*StickySyrup he has a comfortable bed
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: That's what the episode features, yes.
<MIDNIGHT> I loved The Last Roundup, beyond the OMG DERPY factor
*SuperBrony64|Zzz sits StickySyrup in chair in corner of room
<Kammerjunk> It also reminds me of Napoleon XIV, so that's good.
<derpy_pony> they need more rowers
<MASF123> Wow, nothing else not even the morals or animation were mention
*StickySyrup HELP MEH

<Starflash> Dat SB
<StickySyrup> its like being in fluttershys shed
<xles> Go go Jamie.
*SuperBrony64|Zzz sleep talks 'You. Watch. Boogey colt. I sleep -___-'
<MASF123> I would call it Twilight's best episode
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: The animation features in all the episodes, and while the moral is important, I already knew it.
<Starflash> StickySyrup we decided not to speak of that :3
<MIDNIGHT> Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 is another favorite, liked the musical number, Rainbow rage, and Applejack at the end with her Dear Princess Celestia bit. :D
*SuperBrony64|Zzz goes into bed and lays down
*StickySyrup reads you go the fuck to sleep
*SuperBrony64|Zzz gets up to sleep hug StickySyrup
*StickySyrup whispers
<MASF123> The animation improves episode after episode, I thought somepony would atleast notice the change
<StickySyrup> guys.. what do I do
<Phase4> StickySyrup: ...sleep i supose, your kinda stuck there
<Mutterguy> go the fuck to sleep

<MASF123> I must have not been here when you said it, @Sumica
<MIDNIGHT> I mean, the animation is cool and all, and the style is appealing and part of the reason why I watch, but.... I don't just watch a show because it looks pretty.
<StickySyrup> yeah seriously... and release me
<Sumica> 00,10Probably not.
<StickySyrup> lol someone took a dump in the kitchen
<Phase4> all of them
<derpy_pony> 4 germs...oh my...
<Sumica> 00,10A good example is twi walking through ponyville, where she is coming at the camera.
*SuperBrony64|Zzz locks door, swallows key, and falls asleep in bed
<Kammerjunk> The windows are dark in the town, child. The whales huddle down in the deep.
*StickySyrup breaks the window
*StickySyrup runs
<Kammerjunk> I'll read you one very last book if you swear, you'll go the fuck to sleep.
*StickySyrup jumps out of SB's window

*Kammerjunk applies the unit to #bronystate
<Kammerjunk> Wow, this place really -is- dead.

<DeadpoolDash> watching this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo78p_tBBHg
<RainbowJack> listening to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNYImyUbiMk&feature=g-all-u&context=G2e3946dFAAAAAAAAAAA
<Kammerjunk> RainbowJack: He is the host, the man you call Ghost.
<Kammerjunk> He's a melting pot of friendship.
<RainbowJack> yeah
<RainbowJack> MELTING POT OF ALCHOLO
<RainbowJack> i love his hate of brony's
<Kammerjunk> He's a troll.
<RainbowJack> because that makes them troll him
<RainbowJack> i know
<Kammerjunk> So it's trolls trolling trolls.
<Kammerjunk> It's either a lose-lose situation or a win-win one.
<RainbowJack> but sometimes ghost has a point
<xles> Alcohol: Makes friendship magic?
<RainbowJack> sure it does
<xles> Watching big bang theory reruns.
<xles> ugh, and there it is. Digestion engaged, route all available power towards digestion.
<DeadpoolDash> ...
<Kammerjunk> ....
<xles> Sorry, I just hate that comatose feeling you get after lunch. =P
*Phase4 is doing science
<xles> Phase4: Tell us good sir, what form of science?
<Phase4> Computer Science!
<xles> Egads, it surely must be magic!
<Phase4> its mostly science
<xles> =)
<Dashie_Dashie> I return with no sleep.
<Dashie_Dashie> o_o
<xles> Yay?
<Phase4> Dashie_Dashie: DING
<Dashie_Dashie> DING DING DING
<Dashie_Dashie> So what? There's only like 3 people alive?
<Kammerjunk> Everybody's dead, Dave.

<Dashie_Dashie> Mods are being spys right now, using their cloak and dagger.
<Dashie_Dashie> shhh....

<xles> Kammerjunk: Good save.
<Kammerjunk> Hey boys, it's a SPAH!
<Dashie_Dashie> Gentlemen.. *snort snort*
<MASF123> Flutteryshy your putting me in a bind, Rainbow Dash what is on your mind?
<Kammerjunk> Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time. Must remember Applejack's duds must shine!
<Kammerjunk> I'm not sure if those are the exact lyrics.
<MASF123> XD
<MASF123> Piece by piece, snip by snip
<MASF123> Shoulders back....?
<MASF123> .....something.....hip.
<Kammerjunk> I only remember the Something Broke parody of Art of the Dress.
<MASF123> ok
<MASF123> All we ever want is in decision, all really like is what we know
<MASF123> Gotta balance style with adherence
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r-kg6T2cGA&feature=related
<MASF123> Making sure we make a good appearance
<MASF123> But if you simply have to fudge it, make sure it stays within our budget!
<Kammerjunk> TRIXIE
<TrixieMuffin> JUNK

<Dashie_Dashie> Jesus christ why is cupcakes in my recommended videos -__-
*Dashie_Dashie kills it with fire
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony!! :)
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83Iu3RBQWU i think the refference density in this vid is greater than the creators thought it was
<Phase4> ohai RaveBrony
<Dashie_Dashie> New looney toons is... meh.. I prefer the old ones.
<Phase4> its a little heavy with the iron giant parody
<RaveBrony> :o
<Phase4> http://youtu.be/iX0cGftqbrg is the origional scene (WARNING: IRON GIANT SPOILER, DONT WATCH IF YOU PLAN TO SEE)
<Phase4> that actualy makes posting the vid a little pointless
<Phase4> herp derp obvious
*Phase4 should be in bed
<RaveBrony> God i loved the Iron Giant...
<RaveBrony> PHase4, why dont you get some sleep then :)
<RaveBrony> *Phase4
<Phase4> because i'ma stay up a bit more
<RaveBrony> Alright then :P
<Phase4> that scene with the missle is one of the best in any film ever imho
<RaveBrony> ^
<Kammerjunk> Why does FIMFiction always go on maintenance when I try to read fanfics?
<RaveBrony> Lol
<RaveBrony> I really like some of the fanfics... and thats REALLY Big for me seeing as how i hate reading
<Kammerjunk> It's the exact opposite for me. I've read my entire life.
<Dashie_Dashie> I agree RaveBrony, couldn't give two shits about it in school.. but when it comes to ponies.
<Kammerjunk> Well, not literally, but you know what I mean.
<Dashie_Dashie> imokwiththis.jpeg
<RaveBrony> Lol!! :D
<Kammerjunk> That's also why I have the collection I have.
<TrixieMuffin> You awaken with a headache and fuzzy memory , last thing you recall was a bright flash outside. You are lying on the floor and sunlight filters in through the window! (anyone up forsome rpg-ing? im bored like that)
<Dashie_Dashie> Macbeth was honestly the only story I liked in high school.
<Dashie_Dashie> well story/play
<Kammerjunk> MLP roleplays make me depressed.
<RaveBrony> I went to the site to take a look at it, read one sentence of a fic....then lost about 45minutes of my day (45 minutes wel spent)
<Kammerjunk> Macbeth is good, I like it.
<RaveBrony> I never read Macbeth....
<TrixieMuffin> its not mlp , yet
<Kammerjunk> >yet
<Kammerjunk> Even worse.
<Dashie_Dashie> I love how I was the only one in my school that knew what minecraft was and I brought in my flashdrive with minecraft on it.
<TrixieMuffin> at some point there may be ponies
<Kammerjunk> Exactly.
<Dashie_Dashie> me and two other friends were the only ones that played it.
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Kammerjunk> So depressing.
<Kammerjunk> I found this incomplete 63 chapter lately. That was my day.
<Dashie_Dashie> I put it on the schools hard drive, 3 months later I walk into my library, 15 freshman are playing it.
<Kammerjunk> Well, some of it.
<RaveBrony> I dont know how to role play through text, TrixieMuffin :(
<Dashie_Dashie> walked up to them said "you're welcome" and walked away like a boss
<Phase4> ohai TrixieMuffin
<RaveBrony> Nice :D
<Dashie_Dashie> I miss the library from my school >_> the libriarians loved me.. let me do what ever I want, yelled at others for doing the same thing I did xD
<Dashie_Dashie> must of been because I was a senior @_@
<TrixieMuffin> you just type what you do and thats it ....but noone wants to play apparently
<Kammerjunk> I often roleplay through text, I love descriping in detail. But MLP roleplays make me so depressed.
<TrixieMuffin> ok its not mlp
<TrixieMuffin> you are a human
<Kammerjunk> Mainly because I can't go there IRL.
<Kammerjunk> ...YET.
<TrixieMuffin> and telling more would be spoilers
<Dashie_Dashie> What if.. heaven is what you picture it to be.. like if you thought it was equestria and it IS equestria.
<Dashie_Dashie> never know .__.
<TrixieMuffin> ok never
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: That'd be awesome if I was a believer. Or, well, apathetic agnostic, but still.
<TrixieMuffin> no ponies other than on tv in the rp
<Dashie_Dashie> everyone has their opinions. =p
<RaveBrony> :P
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm christian at heart, but I don't mind peoples perspectives on things.
<Kammerjunk> TrixieMuffin: Wouldn't it be a tad boring with only two people?
<Dashie_Dashie> doesn't bother me.
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: Same for me. I don't mind people believeing what they will as long as they don't stick it down MY throat.
<TrixieMuffin> well Rave seemed interested , but noone else by he looks of it
<RaveBrony> Same, Dashie_Dashie
<TrixieMuffin> still im already bored so i might be a step up
<TrixieMuffin> and if im good at it others may join
<Kammerjunk> The exception being Scientology.
<Dashie_Dashie> Kammerjunk, Honestly I disowned my grandparents because they were radical christians that shoved things down people throat.. I couldn't deal with it.
<Dashie_Dashie> Haven't seen them in years.
<RaveBrony> brb, i want some breakfast before the show comes on at 8 :P
<Dashie_Dashie> what show RaveBrony =o?

<RaveBrony> I dont think so D: do you not get the hub?
<Kammerjunk> Oh, well.
<Kammerjunk> I'll just watch the 1080p episode I downloaded.
<Dashie_Dashie> I really wish I had my old ATI program that let me watch TV on my computer stright from my cable box..
<Dashie_Dashie> The Hub is like channel 1920 for me xD
<Dashie_Dashie> well that's the HD one

<RaveBrony> :P
<Dashie_Dashie> I can't wait to build my custom computer when I get the money to :$
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: Building it yourself it much easier.
<TrixieMuffin> As you stand up, you notice the puddle you were lying in and an uncomfortable lump in your pants.
<Dashie_Dashie> and when I get my appartment I want a two bedroom, one for my slumber, and another for my computer room which will be lined with ponies everywhere.
<Kammerjunk> TrixieMuffin: Sorry, but wouldn't it be easier in another room? Maybe it's just my insatiable hunger for organising, but it'd just seem easier to overlook.
<TrixieMuffin> You are hungry like a wolf, and thirsty, how long were you out for ?
<Dashie_Dashie> I'll be 20 on august 18th I need to move the hell out of my parents .__.
<TrixieMuffin> first i need at least 1 player , then we can migrate
<RaveBrony> Oh wow Dashe_Dashie :o
<Kammerjunk> I'll play, but I think it'll be a bit boring alone.
<TrixieMuffin> otherwise ill just go back to being bored
<Dashie_Dashie> post on ponychan
<RaveBrony> Pshh, my older bro is 19 and he doesnt plan on moving out anytime soon....
<Dashie_Dashie> I WANT to move out xD
<Dashie_Dashie> to think that me having a appartment to myself, and a computer room within that appartment with my new beastly custom bult computer and the room aligned with ponies..
<Dashie_Dashie> *sigh* I await that day
<RaveBrony> Ill be 18 on May 4th :D cant wait to get my grad presents :$
<Dashie_Dashie> my grad present was getting drunk and eating ribs.
<Dashie_Dashie> immorethanokwiththat.jpeg
<RaveBrony> Woah! My parents wud Never allow that :D lucky! lol
<Dashie_Dashie> It's because I'm german.. and my father.. well kinda doesn't care lol.
<Dashie_Dashie> he plans on taking me to oktoberfest
<RaveBrony> But they promised me I can build a gaming computer and they'll pay for it :)
<TrixieMuffin> Guys anyone else interested in some chat rpg-ing ? ill leave it alone if we dont get at least 3 player because it gets boring too fast
<RaveBrony> Omg!! Ive seen seen so many vids of oktoberfest, looks awesome! But i dont know whether or not i can hold my liquor
<Dashie_Dashie> liquor? my good sir, we're talking about the finest ale on the earth!
<Dashie_Dashie> german beer is best beer.
<Kammerjunk> I've never been to an Oktoberfest.
<RaveBrony> Alli have is an occsional pina colada...in a small wine glass...
<Dashie_Dashie> I can kill a pint of Jack Daniels no problem.
<Dashie_Dashie> :x
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<Kammerjunk> I don't always drink, but when I do, it's Jack Daniel's.
<Dashie_Dashie> almost killed an 8th of jack daniels by myself, until I keep missing shots at beer pong and just stopped.
<RaveBrony> Dat Twilight waking up too early
<TrixieMuffin> boredom it is , back to playing some flash games
<Dashie_Dashie> oh that was a fun new years eve..
<Dashie_Dashie> Kammerjunk: /)
<RaveBrony> :D
<Dashie_Dashie> JD was my first liquor.
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: (\
<Dashie_Dashie> loved it ever since =P
<Kammerjunk> My first was a sort of liquorice drink, but I much prefer whiskey.
<Dashie_Dashie> heh.. makes me wonder where wrek is.. I'd love to hear his drunken tales.
<RaveBrony> Ive tried many things :o
<RaveBrony> Dont get drunk tho, lol
<Dashie_Dashie> I remember killing half a bottle of rum one night camping in the woods with a couple of my buddies.
<Dashie_Dashie> ended up playing chicken with roman candles..
<Dashie_Dashie> <-- got hit in the eye xD
<RaveBrony> o..m..g o_o
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I try to not drink TOO much. I can still keep my balance right up until I puke, but it's still not fun.
<Dashie_Dashie> Note to self: Never kill a bottle of vodka with yourself and a friend in a cold garage playing beer pong.
<Dashie_Dashie> many toilet hugs were given.
<Kammerjunk> Note to self: Never kill a bottle of vodka alone.
<Kammerjunk> That is all.
<Dashie_Dashie> unless you're russian.
<Dashie_Dashie> xD
<Kammerjunk> True.
<Dashie_Dashie> Thing is.. Russian vodka is WAYYYY more potent
<Dashie_Dashie> more proof
<RaveBrony> 3 months of winter coolness, and Awesome holidaaays!!
<Kammerjunk> Sounds plausible.
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, it's almost spring.
<Dashie_Dashie> I know right :>
<Kammerjunk> I'll be having Winter Wrap Up in my head for a while now, that's for sure.
<Dashie_Dashie> I can't wait to start running again.
<Dashie_Dashie> it gets too cold in new york to run now a days
<Kammerjunk> We have this running machine at our home.
<Kammerjunk> Stuff is neat.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm twilight sparkle when it comes to running.
<Dashie_Dashie> I enjoy scenery
<Dashie_Dashie> I enjoy nature as a matter of fact.
<Kammerjunk> I enjoy occupying myself when running. So I put a TV on the opposite wall.
<Dashie_Dashie> Lol xD
<Dashie_Dashie> 8 months ago I was a metal head, now I watch ponies.
<Dashie_Dashie> not a single f**k was given.
<Kammerjunk> Why not both?
<RaveBrony> I just moved to NY last fall....everyone said this years winter was weak
<Dashie_Dashie> Electro/trance/dubstep/DnB/Hardstyle are my music types now.
<Kammerjunk> My German teacher from Russia says that it easily got -40C in Moscow at winter.
<Dashie_Dashie> to hell with that.
<RaveBrony> O.O
<Dashie_Dashie> it's 4F where I am now.
<Dashie_Dashie> I can deal with that.
<Dashie_Dashie> but -40C?
<Dashie_Dashie> CMON MAN
<Kammerjunk> But you're not playing in the snow.
<Dashie_Dashie> <-- hasn't had snow all winter
<Dashie_Dashie> suprisingly.
<RaveBrony> ^^
<Kammerjunk> We had snow here.
<Kammerjunk> I don't like snow.
<Dashie_Dashie> you sound like my friend zack lol.
<Kammerjunk> Too cold.
<RaveBrony> The first time i saw snow was about back in October O_o expected alot more...then was disappointed
<Dashie_Dashie> My friend Peva just posted this on facebook >_<
<Dashie_Dashie> much diabeetus was given
<Dashie_Dashie> http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz9cs0pjuN1r59x0do1_500.png
<Kammerjunk> Usually, it's just relatively cold here. Doesn't rain England-style, but doesn't snow a lot either.
<Kammerjunk> I can not look at that picture for several seconds at a time.
<CCCP> Rainbow dash would never get diabeetus
<CCCP> pinkie pie would

*RaveBrony plays taps for Bronystate :(
*Jim crashes into the chat
<Jim> ohai everyone
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi.
<Jim> How's it going?
<Kammerjunk> Forward. As always.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, it'd be weird if time suddenly started going backwards.
<Kammerjunk> So it's going forwards instead.
<Jim> Yeah
<Jim> It'd be pretty cool though
<Kammerjunk> How nice of Chronos to let time just flow forward like this.
<Kammerjunk> It would.
<StickySyrup> wow.. chat is alive today
<Kammerjunk> No, it's not.
<Kammerjunk> You're seeing things.
<StickySyrup> lol
<Jim> It's not that alive

<Bronyzilla> It's not at class. Depy Day is an unnoficial Holiday. :3
<Bronyzilla> unofficial* I rwally can't spell today....
<emangamer> Bronyzilla: no. I just got back from class and I'll have to go back soon
<Bronyzilla> Oh.
<Bronyzilla> I just came back from school for the day.
<emangamer> lucky bastard
<Bronyzilla> Pff.
<Bronyzilla> Do you get to go home for lunch or something?
<KwakLad> I do
<Bronyzilla> Lucky. -,-
<KwakLad> But motorbike is broken so i have to cycle instead
<KwakLad> and it takes ages
<emangamer> Bronyzilla: not normally, but lab was short today
<Bronyzilla> You ride a motorbike? :o
<Bronyzilla> kk emangamer.
<KwakLad> im learner i aint to pass my test by may
<Bronyzilla> Awesome.
<emangamer> I ride a moped...;'
<Bronyzilla> I ride a bike. :c
<KwakLad> im learning on a really trashy chinese bike because i wanted a geared bike, and it was cheap think to have for 5 months
<Bronyzilla> Yeah.
<KwakLad> i already have a yamaha xj600 for after my test
<Bronyzilla> Epic.
<Bronyzilla> *googles
<RAWRity> I'm not entirely sure why, but some guy just randomly came roller blading through my colleges cafeteria.
<Syndicate> xD
<Bronyzilla> :3
<KwakLad> emangamer: my mate rides a 125cc ped, it fully exploded when he was riding it yesterday
<Jim> Because roller blades are so awesome
<Syndicate> I need a bike. -_-
<emangamer> KwakLad: the problem is that I dont wanna have to get a motorcycle liscens
<KwakLad> ahh
<Bronyzilla> Lol, most of the people here are in the middle of school. :P
<RAWRity> emangamer: you looking to get a scooter?
<KwakLad> how long have you had your CBT?
<emangamer> RAWRity: I already have one, but I cant drive higher than 50ccs
<Syndicate> Hey guys...
<KwakLad> emangamer: because of your age?
<emangamer> wah???
<emangamer> KwakLad: because anything bigger than 50ccs requires a morotcycle liscens
<RAWRity> eeyup.
<Jim> I have the license for a moped and car, but not motorcycle
<Syndicate> OP deletes Facebook post because of you=successful trolling?
<RAWRity> NC law says anything bigger than 50cc is a motorcycle
<KwakLad> I dunno how the law works in the US otherwise i sjust suggest you get a motorbike
<RAWRity> because NC is filled with dumb asses
<emangamer> RAWRity: so does SC
*RainBowJack hugs RAWrity
<RAWRity> hi RainBowJack
<emangamer> RAWRity: can I have a hug???
<RAWRity> maybe
<RainBowJack> hi RAWRity
*RainBowJack hugs Emangamer
<emangamer> RAWRity: wait...I dont want impotency
<emangamer> STAW AWAY FROM ME
<KwakLad> Whut? RAWRity hug causes impotency
<RAWRity> contact with my soul causes impotency. and female patter baldness
<Jim> I don't even-
<RAWRity> I make a living off of hugging as many people as possible on the street, then selling viagra to them online.
<RAWRity> and my friend owns a wig shop, so it all works out.
<RAWRity> http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/426127_10150692211635802_780510801_11395757_524836677_n.jpg
<Jim> RAWRity: That makes sense
<Jim> Also, AWESOME picture
<emangamer> RAWRity: not as good as some of the other ones i've seen
<KwakLad> wow i like that RAWRity okay so a hug with you is fine aslong as it doesnt mean much? (so our souls dont get close and/or such)
<RAWRity> KwakLad: eeyup.
<emangamer> KwakLad: lol
<emangamer> dat empotency
<Syndicate> xD
<KwakLad> oh but i'd still feel bad giving a hug that means nothing
<Bronyzilla> :P
<RAWRity> do that really awkward Bro-hug thing that starts off with a handshake.
<Jim> Super secret handshake of doom?
<KwakLad> Ohh okay
<emangamer> RAWRity: seriously, how have we not met up yet?
<RAWRity> emangamer: because You'd try to kill me with an ax if we did.
<Bronyzilla> indeed.
<KwakLad> you two live close to each other?
<emangamer> RAWRity: but I dont own an ax?
<KwakLad> we need to try and get a UK brony meet going properly :/
<unfoundbug> KwakLad theres apparently a large one in a few months
<unfoundbug> in london
<emangamer> RAWRity: If we both go to bronycon would you wanna ride together so its not boring as hell?
<RAWRity> Afraid I won't be able to go to Summer Bronycon.
<KwakLad> someone apparently has a part in currently very basic prep for a manchester one (because manchester is in the middle of the uk ish so scotts can get there too)
<emangamer> RAWRity: how cuz?
<KwakLad> but i know nothing much about that
<RAWRity> I'm taking summer classes this year, so I'll most likely be working on schoolwork or some shit.
<Kipkat07> Hi everypony
<Jim> hi Kipkat07
<RAWRity> I've got a 2-year scholarship at my school that covers all my tuition, so I'm trying to shove as many classes as I can into that time period before I have to start paying.
<emangamer> RAWRity: c'mon...you'll get to meet lauren faust :D
<RAWRity> I know, and I'd love to go, but what with the cost of it, and the time, and my school, I just won't be able to.
<emangamer> RAWRity: we'll talk when time gets closer
<RAWRity> fine
<KwakLad> hey Kipkat07

<The_4th_Wall> i'm talking a 3-foot drop
<Kammerjunk> The_4th_Wall: That was silly of you.
<Capn_fisty> i was lying on the floor with the laptop on my bed
<The_4th_Wall> my heart stopped for about 5 seconds
<KwakLad> You aew indeed lucky no damage was sustained
<The_4th_Wall> because i was in here
<Fazana> The_4th_Wall: If so, you should see a doc
<Fazana> It isn't normal for a heart to stop for 5 whole seconds :o
<The_4th_Wall> and when i picked it up, the power was off
<Kammerjunk> I remember a phone I once had. Dropped it down a staircase, still working. I think if I pulled that stunt today, I'd have some dozen bits to gather.
<Kammerjunk> Not money, either.
<The_4th_Wall> must have been the physical shock
<The_4th_Wall> oh
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I had the thing happen with a baby alarm.
<Fazana> I accidently my phone into the toilet. I heard a SZZZCKKKT.
<The_4th_Wall> phone experience
<Kammerjunk> Phones were much more fun when they were robust.
<The_4th_Wall> cricket's Huawei Ascend:
<Capn_fisty> last night my computer tried to load that huge pony picture as the background, i derped so hard and force shut down my computer and when i tried to start it it wouldnt log on prperly and i had to spend an hour trying to fix it
<The_4th_Wall> POS
<The_4th_Wall> cricket's Huawei Ascend: Piece of Shit
<Capn_fisty> then i played l4d2
<Fazana> Hmm
<Fazana> There was something I was gonna do
<Fazana> But I can't remember what now.
<Kammerjunk> I have an iPhone 3GS now, planning on getting an Android when I inevitably break my iPhone.
<The_4th_Wall> i had one, dropped it only 5 inches, screen cracked.
<Kammerjunk> The prospect of making your apps sounds good.
<The_4th_Wall> got another under warranty
<Fazana> Mine's been VERY lucky to survive a 2 meter fall from my doublebunk bed
<Fazana> I have a G1 iPod
<Fazana> Bought it release day ^_^
<The_4th_Wall> it dropped too. 3 inches, and it never turned on again
<Kammerjunk> I have never owned anything before the first series of iPod Touch. Didn't care much for music before then.
<Fazana> I don't usemine for music
<Fazana> Only youtubeing at night when I should be asleep :D
<The_4th_Wall> Left Cricket for AT&T, now I have a Motorola Atrix
<Kammerjunk> Now, I have music running virtually constantly, unless I'm watching something.

<The_4th_Wall> I<3 my Atrix
<Fazana> The_4th_Wall: Not heard of ANY of them.
<Capn_fisty> i got itouch and i abuse it a little, the amount of times i have dropped it it must hate me
<Fazana> Well, only AT&T in F1, but I didn't know what company it was

<CountDoofus> thanks, but as long as it isn't original, I ain't happy :p
<CCCP> like how old is Twilight
<CuddlyKittens11> 74u2clhs1w2p
<CuddlyKittens11> o shit.
<ofna01> ummm
<CountDoofus> no idea, but I know Fluttershy is one year older than Pinkie
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: Not canon. But she's a student.
<Iwubponiez> cccp no one knowa
<Iwubponiez> knows
<CCCP> CountDoofus: lol
<Kammerjunk> An extraordinary student, sure, but a student nonetheless.
<ofna01> what the hell is wrong with my internet
<ofna01> hmmm
<ofna01> as for the age question
<Fazana> Just been sent a video of my mates crasj
<Kammerjunk> I'd say young adults.
<CCCP> I feel bad for twilight
<ofna01> yeah
<Iwubponiez> some 1 link me to that song
<Fazana> My initial reaction: Hooollyyy crapp
<ofna01> maybe teens,pre-teens?
<Iwubponiez> plz
<Jim> I'd say they are somewhere from 18-25
<CuddlyKittens11> test.
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: That'd be the CMC.
<Kammerjunk> They're fillies.
<ofna01> too old jim
<ofna01> tell that to jim he says their 25
<Kammerjunk> Twilight is obviously older than the CMC.
<KwakLad> are we talking human equivalent years then?
<ofna01> yep
<KwakLad> right
<CountDoofus> Iwubponiez: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uzv1xlxyd4 think it's this one
<Fazana> He hit the barrier at a 45 degree angle and did a bunch of barrel rolls, before coming to a stop upside down
<ThatsAShinySky> GUYS
<ThatsAShinySky> pinkie pie is a ninja
<ThatsAShinySky> if you didnt know
<ofna01> yep
<Kammerjunk> YOU DON'T SAY.
<ThatsAShinySky> o;
<ofna01> and also a good singer
<CCCP> how is granny smith as old as when they started to settle is PonyVille?
<ThatsAShinySky> nah
<ThatsAShinySky> rainbow is
<Kammerjunk> Guys! Pinkie Pie is a pony!
<ThatsAShinySky> OH MY GAWH
<ThatsAShinySky> didnt realise
<ofna01> I DIDNT KNOW THAT
<CCCP> also why are all of the main 6 such good fucking voice actors and amazing singers too?
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: Granny Smith is actually Cronus in disguise.
<ofna01> Fazana what are you talking about?
<ThatsAShinySky> Is this done in tablet?
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: lol
<CountDoofus> 6 ponies, 4 voice actresses
<CountDoofus> seems legit
<Iwubponiez> lol
<Fazana> If you aren't bothered, don't listen, but just incase anyone who was listening earlier
<ofna01> so i'd summerize the mane 6 are anywhere from 10-14
<Kammerjunk> ThatsAShinySky: Wrek draws all his art with the mouse, IIRC.
<CountDoofus> Eeeyup
<CCCP> CountDoofus: its a lie the ponies are real
<ofna01> anyone agree with me?
<Iwubponiez> 10 noooooooooo 14 mmmaybe 16 ya 18 eeyup
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: Not quite.
<CCCP> 14-18
<Jim> Well, Rarity has a job making dresses, I'd say they are quite older
<CCCP> 14-20
<ofna01> rarity is just really mature
<Iwubponiez> 16-20
<ofna01> she is british after all
<Kammerjunk> I'd say the CMC are around 10-12, converted from human years.
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZn8-4wqqw I think not
<ofna01> CMC?
<Kammerjunk> Cutie Mark Crusaders.
<Jim> But they still are kind of youth-ish, due to Celesia acting like a mother figure for them actually
<ofna01> ah
<Iwubponiez> cmc 7-10
<Fazana> The mane six are roughly in their twenties
<CCCP> Mabey they are like flies and die with in like 3 days and they are only 1 day old
<ofna01> lolno
<ThatsAShinySky> how the
<Fazana> I'd say the CMC are about 13-4 as they havent got their CM, yet others have
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: wat
<ofna01> hmmm
<ThatsAShinySky> how are you gonna save equestria?!
<ofna01> 13-4?
<ofna01> WHAT?
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: i dont know
<ofna01> 13-4?
<Fazana> 13-14
<ofna01> ah
<ThatsAShinySky> i would say 6-12
<ofna01> i always pictured them alot younger
<Iwubponiez> noooo not 13-14
<Fazana> 13-14, usual time before someone hits puberty.
<Iwubponiez> i say 6-10
<ofna01> GOD DANGIT
<CCCP> some one should email Lauren Faust and ask her
<ThatsAShinySky> anyone?
<ofna01> go for it CCCP
<ThatsAShinySky> i could
<ThatsAShinySky> yeah
<ThatsAShinySky> :P
<ofna01> anyone who can
<ThatsAShinySky> awesome music :D
<CCCP> ofna01 : i would if i knew her email adress
<ofna01> google is your friend CCC
<ThatsAShinySky> ill see
<Iwubponiez> i think she said they are teenagers before
<Iwubponiez> i seen her comment in DA
<ofna01> i dont think their teens
<CountDoofus> if I were to guess, I'd say around 20ish
<ofna01> Dash i can understand that,she's got that rebellious attitude,but the rest,i dont think so
<Kammerjunk> Hold on, I'll check my Faust pictures, see if I can find it.
<Iwubponiez> 18-20 i would believe
<ThatsAShinySky> cant find
<ofna01> still no wub
<CCCP> well lets look at this the average life span of a pony is 25-30 years
<CountDoofus> AHA! unicorn
<CCCP> in real life
<Kammerjunk> I found it on EQD instead.
<ofna01> as i said,the oldest is fluttershy supposedly,but i think dash may be older
<Kammerjunk> The animation FAQ.
<Jim> CCCP: It's easier to compare them to the human age
<ofna01> yeah
<CCCP> Jim: i know
<ThatsAShinySky> Me and RainbowJack are having a strange convo.
<Kammerjunk> I'll spare you the full copypasta and post this.
<Kammerjunk> "...I guess I sort of justified it in my head that they could be childlike young adults."
<ofna01> caare to explain shiny?
<ofna01> young adults
<ofna01> so thats teens
<CCCP> mabey they are all dead and they are ghosts
<unfoundbug> Dont forget, animation years arnt equivelant to human years, Ash is still 13 and hes been on tv for about 12 years
<Kammerjunk> Young adults is young adults.
<Kammerjunk> Teens is teens
<Kammerjunk> HOWEVER
<ofna01> im always called a young adult,and im 15
<CountDoofus> I figure Rarity's the oldest, since she's the only one with a decent business
<Iwubponiez> why are we even talking about this who needs to know their ages anyway :P
<Kammerjunk> Beforehand, she says that "the ponies' ages were left intentionally undefined. I like to think of them as having maturity levels anywhere between 12 and 18..."
<Fazana> Ash was 10, he's about 14 now
<Fazana> I know
<ThatsAShinySky> Ofna01 you really are a young adult
<Fazana> think about simpsoons
<ThatsAShinySky> 18 is an adult
<Fazana> Been around for ages
<ThatsAShinySky> teen starts at 13
<Kammerjunk> She then goes on to say that maturity is different than age.
<Fazana> Maggie always has and still is a baby
<CCCP> i think they are 30 year old single women
<CountDoofus> I'm a young old fart
<ofna01> same here count
<ThatsAShinySky> im a stupid ol' fart.
<ThatsAShinySky> not old.
<CountDoofus> :D
<Kipkat07> they dont go to school so theyre probably ove 18
<Kammerjunk> I'd just link you the page, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to link to EQD.

<CountDoofus> suddenly I get the idea of drawing zombie ponies
<Krakass> Fazana, no. But it helps.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I think I'll draw that when I get the chance O___O
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: Most essay's are 250-450 words IIRC.
<Kammerjunk> It is here, anyway.
<ofna01> yeah,and you have 316 words in the PROLOGUE

<Kammerjunk> ekips: It stands for "If I Recall Correctly"
<Kammerjunk> I never used AFAIK.
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: Seems reasonable to me.
<ekips> afaik, i always use afaik
<Kammerjunk> I see what you did there.
<ofna01> aflac
<CountDoofus> had to figure out for myself "ikr" stood for "I know, right?"

<otakon> Meanwhile: also, your weakest attempt to date, try harder
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> just picture a flash mob dancing and singing smile smile smile :O
*Midnight_Tempest sneaks up behind otakon and whacks him with a foam mallet. Hai!
<CountDoofus> my pick-up line: "Hey. Do you like My Little Pony? No? See ya."
<Meanwhile> Jadeite is one of the rarest minerals on the planet, I figure the only way your internet could be as bad as it is is if it runs on something that almost doesn't exist.
*otakon is unaffected
<otakon> Meanwhile: hmm, not quite as funny as the others is all. Now if you said Unobtainium I would have chuckled THEN said shaddup
<Meanwhile> Idk where the Unobtainium thing comes from.
<alexxm> so noones streaming then
<Meanwhile> Kee-rect.
*Midnight_Tempest crosses the streams, then vanishes
<otakon> Meanwhile: Avatar, the MOST FRIGGIN ADVERTISED DANCES WITH WOLVES WITH SMURFS REMAKE MOVIE EVER!
<Meanwhile> otakon: I'll remind you that the only time I have ever seen Avatar was on an 8 hour plane flight.
<Midnight_Tempest> at least avatar looked shiny...
<Meanwhile> Where my tv got stuck and I couldn't change it.
<otakon> Meanwhile: and thus you are damaged
<Meanwhile> Avatar, on repeat, for 8 hours.
<Midnight_Tempest> so, what... saw it twice?
<otakon> Meanwhile: that explains your lack of emotion
<Meanwhile> How long do you think that movie is?
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: good one
<otakon> it's about 2 and a half hours long IIRC
<otakon> but it feels longe
<otakon> r
<otakon> DAMN YOU TYPOS
<Midnight_Tempest> i like movies that are about 3 hours long, or longer
<Meanwhile> Imagine watching a bad movie. Then watching it again straight after, and then again.
<TROLL> Hi
<TheDerpiest> is anyone streaming?
<Meanwhile> While you're in a cramped chair surrounded by morons and with hospital class food.
<Jim> I don't think anyones streaming
<Meanwhile> Given the option, I'd rather be waterboarded.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Dark_Horst> i'm not getting a stream over here! HALP!
<RaveBrony> refresh :P
<Dark_Horst> dit that
<RaveBrony> :o
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile: you wanna watch bad movies? then watch all the odd numbers Star Treks... those are alot worse than Avatar could ever be
<Dark_Horst> repeatedly
<Meanwhile> Refresh and learn that nothing is streaming.
<Dark_Horst> over the course of the last hour
<Meanwhile> Midnight_Tempest: I'll stick to the series.
<RaveBrony> Oh yeah, nothing is streaming O.o

<Meanwhile> Well it wasn't on when I got here.

*TheGreatAndPowerfulT is listening to Discord (EuroChaos Mix)
<TheGame> Ok HAVE FUN CLOPPING TO HORSES!
<Jim> Cool alexxm
<Meanwhile> Ponies*
<Jim> Tortoises*
<Jim> No wait, wrong scene
<Meanwhile> xD
<alexxm> he said he'd watch the first episode
<Meanwhile> And as is always the case, one is all it takes.
<TheDerpiest> Actually it took me 2 episodes
<Meanwhile> Ah but you watched 2 episodes.
<TheDerpiest> Suited for Success wasnt very good
<TheDerpiest> imo
<Meanwhile> You started with Suited for Success?
<Jim> I didn't actually become a brony after the first episode, but watching the first episode made me watch another one, and then another one, until I finaly became a fullgrown brony
<TheDerpiest> eeyup
<Kammerjunk> I watched the very first episode.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I like suited for success, but I've been in situations like that before
<Kammerjunk> Around halfway in, I knew this show was for me.
<TheDerpiest> Then I watched Ticket Master
<Meanwhile> You're weird.
<TheDerpiest> "Oatmeal, are you CRAZY?" is what finally got me
<kidzrul434> Why do all the B movies suck?
<Kipkat07> i read a fanfic and that started my bronyness
<alexxm> i started my friend on the two parter
<Meanwhile> kidzrul434: because that's kinda the point
<kirzstryfe> 1,3because people have it in their head that a B movie has to be bad
<Jim> All B movies don't suck. Ip Man was for example great
<Meanwhile> Emphasise kinda
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Ip Man was awesome
<dshannon> I just watched them all in a couple of days....my eyes were glazed over by the end of that
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not true revenge of the nerds was good, or that was an A movie uhmm
<Kammerjunk> Shortly after I became a brony, I showed my cousin a picture featuring Dashie and Applejack I spent 5 minutes on where I basically told him.
<Kammerjunk> A week later, he said "20% cooler".
<TheDerpiest> That Indian movie from last week was pretty good
<Meanwhile> Most B movies are amusing because theyr'e so bad they're good.
<Sumica> 00,10Many times the B movie have been better then the A
<alexxm> Kirzstyrfe ip mans probably one of my dads faverite movies
<Meanwhile> But then you get the ones that are good and just on a low budget.
<kidzrul434> so bronies I'm going to see Rock of Ages on thursday
<alexxm> have fun
<Jim> Have fun seeing Tom
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I like the B movies that are picked because they're cult classics, but not the ones that are picked because they're bad
<kidzrul434> bronies are like brownies but without the w
<TheDerpiest> What is this week's B movie?
<Kipkat07> im tired
<kidzrul434> look at the home page
<TheDerpiest> My non-brony friend called me a brownie once
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Space Mutiny
<Sumica> 00,10Space Mutiny
<kirzstryfe> 1,3A movie is Serenity
<TheDerpiest> Whats that about?
<Meanwhile> As far as bronyism goes. I was linked this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftvZFUg4HPc from an Escapist thread. Cue personal investigation, followed by watching every episode that was out at the time, followed by finding Equestria Daily, and by the time it was already way too late.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I've never seen it before lol
<RanDT2> :o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> love night of pony
<TheDerpiest> Meanwhile: thats funny, i was in to touhou before ponies

<Meanwhile> I give up trying to figure out what's going on.
<Jim> Buff Drinkslot
<TheDerpiest> The first mlp fanific I read was Sweet Apple Massacre:(
<otakon> Jim knows
<Midnight_Tempest> MST3K Meanwhile... thats whats happening
<Meanwhile> Idk what that is either.
<otakon> Jim: Brohoof/)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey guys have some diabetus http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3005-you_made_fluttershy_cry_by_xilefti-d4piewf.gif
<F1uttershy> why do fanfics have to be so disturbing
<Jim> (\
<Meanwhile> Jim never knows at home...
<Midnight_Tempest> mystery science theatre 3000 meanwhile...
<Meanwhile> Still don't know what that is.
<flutter_spin> I don't get it. What is with the diabetus joke?
<otakon> Meanwhile: for the love of PONIES you do not know what you are missing, go to youtube and look it up
<Meanwhile> No.
<otakon> flutter_spin: it's from Edward Brimely saying it like DIA-BEET-US
<RanDT2> What am I looking up?
<otakon> and the fact most of the time ponies are just so sweet
<TheDerpiest> Thats how my grandma says it
<otakon> RanDT2: Mystery Science Theater 3000
<RanDT2> ooooh o.o
<otakon> brb
<Meanwhile> F1uttershy: depends on the fanfic.
*Meanwhile slowest response of the day
<Kammerjunk> Yeah.
<Kammerjunk> I have like 40 fanfics I'm waiting to read and another 30 I'm waiting to update.
<Kammerjunk> Not all fanfics are bad.
<flutter_spin> Yeah, still don't get the joke
<TheDerpiest> I would write fanfiction but i suck at writing:(
<Meanwhile> I forget most of the fics I'm reading until I see them updated in eqd's story posts.
<flutter_spin> At least now I know the reference, what poor reference it is
<Kammerjunk> I've written fanfics, but I've never released any.
<Kammerjunk> I was just bored.
<CCCP> stream?
<Meanwhile> Nope.
<Jim> That would be interesting to read sometime Kammerjunk
<CCCP> :/
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Niet nah no nope
<Kammerjunk> No, it wouldn't.
<TheDerpiest> Fanfics are good as long as they arent rated M
<Kammerjunk> Mostly, it's just my headcanon being a lunatic.
<TheDerpiest> Most of the time at least
<otakon> back
<Jim> wb otakon
<Armageddon|Away> I was almost expecting to see Drake on
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-8UactLe4Q
<root> You fail at being away
<Armageddon|Away> Yeah I know
<Armageddon|Away> It's 6:40am though
<root> You set SAIL FOR FAIL!
<Armageddon|Away> ):
<Armageddon|Away> you're wonderful
<Jim> Ponies. Ponies never changes.
<root> I know.
<Armageddon|Away> I agree.
<Kammerjunk> Have you guys ever tried zooming all the way in on Wrek's larger pictures?
<Kammerjunk> Like "Badass Fluttershy".
<CCCP> Jim: lol
<flutter_spin> Reign of Thunder? That's the new Mech game? It feels exactly like Mechwarrior Online... and both look silly
<Kammerjunk> Wrek has some serious attention to detail. I make it a game for myself to thoroughly scan every large picture he makes.
<flutter_spin> Hawken might actually be worthwhile
<Jim> What's his DA again?
<Kammerjunk> http://johntb.deviantart.com/
<CountDoofus> http://johntb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4m1qby so much D'AAAAWWWW
<Midnight_Tempest> huh... mechwarrior online... never heard of it, and i love the battletech universe o.o
<TheDerpiest> dat SuperBrony64
<TheDerpiest> pic
<flutter_spin> Mechwarrior Online is supposed to be a F2P game coming out. It is an MMO which will follow the timeline.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/052/9/3/pinkie__s_creed_by_subjectnumber2394-d4qhds6.png
<flutter_spin> The problem is that they are starting it as an "arena"
<flutter_spin> There will be no PvE content on release
<CCCP> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TlTn-vhmqTY/Tz16zApvviI/AAAAAAAAfQA/unl5rvPINAs/s1600/another_day__s_end_by_tsitra360-d4pooja.jpg
<flutter_spin> Reign of Thunder is brought about by the guys who did MechAssault, also F2P, but is setup as an arena game too.
<flutter_spin> Basically a free-fly MechAssault version
<Meanwhile> I don't really like pvp content in those kind of games.
<Meanwhile> Pvp has a magical way of turning people into douchebags.
<flutter_spin> Hawken is a game that doesn't exactly fit with the Battletech universe but takes the "in a mech" seriously
<Midnight_Tempest> all i wanna do is blow up some clans...
<Jim> ohai Midnight_Tempest
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bfTc_0WMVY Reign of Thunder
<Midnight_Tempest> hi Jim
*RainbowJack hugs Jim and Midnight_tempest
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppGDwk_3FqA Hawken Gameplay
*Jim hugs RainbowJack back
<Meanwhile> So apparently the team behind Amnesia is making a new game due in fall.
<RanDT2> Heya jim! Heya Rainbow!
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/OBmb1
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Nelly.
<RainbowJack> hi ranDT2
<Meanwhile> Inb4 millions of LP videos.
<Midnight_Tempest> i think what needs to be made is another MechWarrior game similar to MechWarrior 3... that was the best game of the series, imo
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orhOvbfyyJw Mechwarrior Online, however.. they are still in concept phases
<otakon> guys you know what we need?
<otakon> a good survival horror game
<Jim> Amnesia?
<Midnight_Tempest> so... another Silent Hill 2?
<otakon> and let me stress that
<otakon> a GOOD one
<ThatsAShinySky> Guys.
<RainbowJack> Project zero
<ThatsAShinySky> Tribes Ascend.
<otakon> not AMY that game was SHITE
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I grew up watching my bro play Mechwarrior 2.
<ThatsAShinySky> Tribes Ascend is so FUN.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> of course Amy was bad the camera and the controls sucks
<TheDerpiest> Oh god its turned into non ponies in this chat
<Meanwhile> I still want someone to stream amnesia.
<Midnight_Tempest> SuperBrony64 streamed a little Amnesia a while back... i gave commentary while he played ^_^
<flutter_spin> Zero Punctuation threw Amy into the pit of despair. It was bad.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> We need more Amnesia and Penumbra
<Meanwhile> Zero Punctuation throws most games into a pit of despair. And rightly so.
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<Armageddon|Away> see you all in 3 days
<flutter_spin> Well, he liked Raymon Origins
<TheDerpiest> Zero Punctuation owns
<root> cya
<flutter_spin> And liked Portal & Portal 2
<Meanwhile> I liked Rayman before it had sequels.
<Midnight_Tempest> who couldn't like Rayman Origins, that game is awesome
<CCCP> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7T0VU7LzYqM/Tw5RO2Gs6MI/AAAAAAAACWc/IPjpXQ7oSyw/s1600/Capture.PNG
<Meanwhile> I played Rayman on a PS1. In a cave. With a box of scraps.
<otakon> lol
<otakon> that ironman meme
<otakon> hay
<TheDerpiest> CCCP: I am okay with this
<otakon> did we watch Ironman here?
<MirrorImage> the movie? yeah
<Meanwhile> We did.
<CCCP> TheDerpiest: :)
<otakon> nice
<Midnight_Tempest> i think a GOOD RPG needs to be made... and not another FF release... FF13 made me disappoint
<CCCP> A good MLP FIM RPG
<otakon> we need to see Thor next or Captain America
<TheDerpiest> I thought FF13 was good
<Jim> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmUkrR9vDjRUdFl0Z0pReE9TS3VPRkZXeFI4VW9POGc&hl=en_US#gid=0
<TheDerpiest> And then I started playing it
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah
<Midnight_Tempest> same
<otakon> CCCP: support Absolute Balance done by MrEvergreen
<CCCP> otakon: :)
<Meanwhile> Captain America was alright, though I can't really remember because about halfway through I needed to use the restroom and it was closed. Que holding a full bladder for an hour.
<Midnight_Tempest> ive been keeping tabs on this one MLP RPG being made... it looks like it will be fun http://azurecrash.blogspot.com/p/info.html
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Soon we can have another Lord of the rings marathon :p
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< no
<Meanwhile> That weekend was amazing.
<Meanwhile> But chances are we'll probably hit up some other film sequence.
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<Spark_Brave> test
<CCCP> u......u guys watched yellow submarine without me :'(
<Meanwhile> Like The Matrix, or the Alien movies.
<Midnight_Tempest> boooooo Matrix...
<CCCP> We could watch Terminator 2
<Meanwhile> Love The Matrix.
<TheDerpiest> Aww I missed Miyazaki Week
<otakon> TheDerpiest: yes you did, poor soul you are
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile: the first Matrix was awesome, but if you wanna see all three movies in one... while it still makes sense, watch Dark City... it came out a year before Matrix and was pretty much the same movie
<otakon> yh
<Meanwhile> You know what looking at the backlog makes me think of?
<otakon> what?
<Meanwhile> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8OpsPok6iQ
<TheDerpiest> I think they shoulld show Pom Poko
<Midnight_Tempest> GAH! STAR TREK ENTERPRISE WAS WORST STAR TREK EVER!
<otakon> TheDerpiest: put it on your lottery entry
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: oh hush, it was fine
<CCCP> We should watch the 1903 movie "The Great Train Robbery"
<TheDerpiest> otakon:What?
<Meanwhile> Midnight_Tempest: never really watched it, but I like the theme music.
<TheDerpiest> woops
<CCCP> its like 9mins long
<otakon> WE SHOULD WATCH THE GREAT DICTATOR
<Meanwhile> We should dig a moat!
<CCCP> otakon: wait does that have Charlie Chaplin in it?
<otakon> TheDerpiest: the lottery, what we do to determine which movies we watch on BMN, don't you get the newsletter?
<otakon> CCCP: eeyup and the greatest speech ever made
<otakon> ever
<flutter_spin> I will still forever love the captain in Quantum Leap
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: the show threw a wrench in the storyline... which opened the way to the new Star Trek movie... the NX-01 was supposed to explode on its maiden voyage
<CCCP> otakon: yes it is
<TheDerpiest> otakon: Do I need to be registered somewhere?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i was going to suggest Schindler's List but i think the chat would explode
<otakon> TheDerpiest: yh, just pm a mod with your email and they'll sign you up for it
<flutter_spin> And don't forget that Star Trek Online follows the story according to the last film too
<Krakass> TheDerpiest, bronystate@gmail.com
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ANOHTER great movie!
<Meanwhile> TheDerpiest: mail bronystate@gmail.com asking to be added to the mailing list, or pm a mod.
<Meanwhile> Dat break in the sentence.
<TheDerpiest> I'll do that then
<Jim> The Schindler's list is a deep and touching movie, really
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i can see the chat for that one, everyone spaming nazi and other stuff
<Midnight_Tempest> flutter_spin is correct... though i do like STO, its not a horrible MMO and i hate those kinds of games
<Meanwhile> Been a while since I played STO.
<Jim> If it was to be shown, we'd just best hope for maturity amongst the viewers
<Meanwhile> It's nice to have an mmo that doesn't just require "kill this" as an objective.
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: but it's a GREAT movie, put it on your selection! I can't I already filled mine out
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> same thing
<Midnight_Tempest> i play it for a couple hours every day... though the sound doesnt work in the game, so i play music while i fly around
<CCCP> We should watch the Good The Bad and the Ugly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> maybe for the next week
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is that or downfall
<RanDT2> Meanwhile: Agreed
<Everlasting_Joy> Greeting everypony.
<Jim> Have we watched any Westerns lately?
<Midnight_Tempest> idea... I DEMAND A CLINT EASTWOOD MARATHON!
<CCCP> hi Everlasting_Joy
<Jim> Ohai Everlasting_Joy
<flutter_spin> I played through STO for a month. It combines all the fun stuff from all the series.
<RanDT2> hihi! Everlasting_Joy
<Dark_Horst> meanwhile: what is this mmo you're referring to?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ohai there Everlasting_Joy... feeling joyful today?
<flutter_spin> The space combat is genius, but the ground combat will have you crying.
<Meanwhile> But I'm hardly fit to talk about mmo diversity, I've played WoW for like, 5 years.
<Midnight_Tempest> flutter_spin: its F2P on steam if you wanna play it
<otakon> eeyup
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy CCCP, Jim, RanDT2 and LordCelestia.
<flutter_spin> "Star Trek Online" just went F2P
<otakon> I still haven't tried out DC Universe and it's F2P too
<Scavender> Bai guys, have to go to bed, have fun here.
<otakon> hiya Everlasting_Joy
<Meanwhile> Just? It's been F2P for like a month.,
<Everlasting_Joy> LordCelestia I am a little joyous today, but it could be better.
<flutter_spin> ugh. DC Universe is ... bad
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy otakon.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Scavender
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ah
<RanDT2> Meanwhile: I played back in the Vanilla days xD but i try all kinds of mmo . they all have the same ideah though
<otakon> night Scavender sleep well
<Jim> night scav
<flutter_spin> Just. It has been sub for 2 years. Comparing it to that.. yeah JUST
<Everlasting_Joy> Night Scavender.
<Krakass> WWIIOL is best MMO
<Midnight_Tempest> DC Universe was horrible... the opening movie however was awesome
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hey Everlasting_Joy, i forgot to tell you, you look a LOT like someone I know in real life named Ryan.
<ZREOfan> hello
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey, y'all realize it's been 1 month since "The Last Roundup"?
<Meanwhile> LordCelestia + Ryan OTP.
<otakon> it has?
<flutter_spin> I played DC Universe for a week. I was done. You only get 20 levels
<Everlasting_Joy> LordCelestia do you ahve a pic?
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont keep track of time...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Eenope
<otakon> and it's STILL not back on iTunes is it?
<RanDT2> le sigh.. Ryan is an over used name..
<LordCelestia> 0,5Why, is your name Ryan? o___O
<RanDT2> ya
<Everlasting_Joy> Well, that's still neat I look like someone.
<flutter_spin> Lord of the Rings Online was quite enjoyable
<LordCelestia> 0,5I meant EJ
<Midnight_Tempest> im not much of an MMO fan... ive played DCU, STO and WoW... and i only like STO
<RanDT2> woops o.o
<flutter_spin> Yeah, if it wasn't for my bro I probably wouldn't have made it to the end in STO
<Everlasting_Joy> LordCelestia No, my name is Elliott, but if I look like someone you know, that's really nice.
<flutter_spin> Especially since we had the best ships in the universe: U.S.S. Bacon & U.S.S. Donut
<Meanwhile> I had a look at TOR during it's opening weekend, was rather neat. But trying to balance mmo's when you're already commited to one is like painting the celing while riding a bear.
<flutter_spin> I will play TOR, when my bro is ready and when they tweak the bugs
<Midnight_Tempest> flutter_spin: my ship is called the U.S.S Ravana right now... and im not very far into the game, maybe level 15... 16... not sure
<Everlasting_Joy> So did anyone else notice it's been 1 month since Derpy talked?
<Midnight_Tempest> nope
<Meanwhile> No.
<LordCelestia> 0,5IKR
<Meanwhile> Midnight_Tempest: what rank is that. I can't remember.
<Midnight_Tempest> lieutenant commander
<Meanwhile> Is the Ravana tactical engineering or science?
*ZREOfan yawns
<Midnight_Tempest> Ravana
<Midnight_Tempest> tactical
<LordCelestia> 0,5tacticular
<LordCelestia> 0,5tacticularly
<Midnight_Tempest> gah... coughing fit... dieing... bleh
<Meanwhile> Well when you hit captain I'll fire up the Borealis and we can go shoot Borg together.
<LordCelestia> 0,5tacticularizationalismicsism
<flutter_spin> I could only do the STF maybe 3 times each... then I was done.
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile: yes... we will, damn borg encounters are impossilbe at my level
<flutter_spin> There was nothing more for me
<Meanwhile> Is it still shift+space to fire all possible weapon bays?
<TheDerpiest> Ahh MMO speak!
<flutter_spin> Actually you can set it to autoshoot when ready
<Bronyzilla> ?
<Meanwhile> Even better. As if my tactical officer needed more of a reason to fire randomly.
<Midnight_Tempest> Meanwhile, im not sure... i use space for my phasers and 2, 3 for torpedoes... thats all i remember
<NovedCheese> hio
<Midnight_Tempest> really... FIRE AT WILL!!
<Bronyzilla> Hi NovedCheese.
<flutter_spin> In other words, you will never have to tell your ship to fire your weapons again. You just set it to autofire and it will shoot when there is no cooldown
<NovedCheese> im in a theater
<Bronyzilla> Yep.
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... i think im gonna get some excersice, then play some STO... later all
<TheDerpiest> I have to go to the doctor now, so bye everyone
<Meanwhile> I really liked the whole shift power to improve systems thing though, that's still there right?
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care TheDerpiest.
<Bronyzilla> Bye TheFerpiest!
<flutter_spin> yep.
<Bronyzilla> Derp*
<Meanwhile> Suddenly in the mood for star trekking.
<Bronyzilla> I am very foalish with my spelling. :c
<Midnight_Tempest> star trekking across the universe, on the starship enterprise under captain kirk!
<flutter_spin> But the lockboxes they added to STO & LOTRO (as seen in TF2) are horrrrrrible
<Meanwhile> Bronyzilla: if you partly type a name and press tab it'll autofill for you.
<flutter_spin> You know, the ones that you get a crate but have to buy the key with real cash
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< effing lockboxes... i had 30 before i just started tossing them
<Bronyzilla> This I must try.
<Bronyzilla> Ohmygoditworks.
<Meanwhile> I only use lockboxes if I feel the need to burn money.
<flutter_spin> And the whisper-all message when someone gets a ship is horrible too
<Midnight_Tempest> i think i saw 40 or 50 people get a Galor class ship the first day i played...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i want to try my luck with a box in TF2 but i just know it is not going to be worth it
<flutter_spin> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/110122.jpg
<Jim> I opened a box during yesterdays TF2 stream
<Midnight_Tempest> ok, im out to get some excersice... ill bbl
<RainbowJack> i have a crat in TF2 i cant open it
<Jim> I got this new Medi-gun
<CountDoofus> you need to buy a key from the TF2 store
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Laters Midnight_Tempest
<MirrorImage> "new" medigun?
<MirrorImage> what new medigun?
<Jim> Well, it was named strange medithingy or something
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> quick fix ?
<Jim> yeah, quick fix
<Jim> Strange quick fix
<Meanwhile> Quickfix is such a waste of an item slot.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i want it ... are you looking for something ?
<Jim> not sure
<CountDoofus> guys, I need a quick opinion on a drawing in progess, if anyone would be so kind to bother
<otakon> okay post it
<Jim> It's really been ages since I played tf2, only started now again with you guys
<otakon> hey Shizuka you still there?
<Meanwhile> Post, and be judged.
<Jim> I'll go cook myself some food
<Shizuka> 13always am i here
<Bronyzilla> go ahead CountDoofus.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> laters jim enjoy your food ~
<CountDoofus> aiming for a crowdsurfing Vinyl. if there's ANYTHING out of place, legs too short, body too big, anything at all: do tell
<Meanwhile> Always I wanna be with you and make believe with you~
<CountDoofus> http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v31/Connor/?action=view&current=IMG_0081.jpg
<CountDoofus> I know the horn's missing for now
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and live in harmont harmony~
<Meanwhile> CountDoofus: what's your name?
<Bronyzilla> That's quality.
<CountDoofus> my name wut? on dA?
<Meanwhile> No in the game of life.
<CountDoofus> real life, then?
<Meanwhile> It's Connor right?
<CountDoofus> nah, it's Tim. Connor just sounds way better :p
<Meanwhile> I'll take that as a compliment then.
<Bronyzilla> Just don't make that drawing too.. y'know.
<RainbowJack> Like Jhon Connor
<Meanwhile> Her hind legs are a little on the short side but otherwise looking good.
<Bronyzilla> I think it looks perfect at the moment.
<CountDoofus> longer hind legs, gotcha. anything else, at all?
<CountDoofus> cutie marks seems a little small too
<Krakass> Pencil doesn't seem sharp enough.
<Bronyzilla> I s'pose.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SSX demo uhmmmm
<CountDoofus> O U
<Meanwhile> Her body is kinda long.
<Krakass> Of course, long pony is long.
<CCCP> needs to be more fat ponies
<Meanwhile> It could just be the way her hind leg closest to the viewpoint is angled.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> snips and the one twist likes are the only ones right ?
<Kammerjunk> >Finally finds MLP/Deus Ex crossover
<Meanwhile> And the eyes come across as ever so slightly derpy.
<Kammerjunk> >Cancelled
<Kammerjunk> :why:
<MirrorImage> My Little Pony - Implants are Magic?
<Meanwhile> Because Deus Ex hasn't been interesting for...well, don't even know how long.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> magic is augmented
<Kammerjunk> Deus Ex: Pony Revolution, actually.
<KwakLad> MirrorImage: i didnt notice what the conversation was about but saw your post and thought you meant breast implants
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i have deus ex, but my laptop can't run it for very long ._.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> still game is good
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Neither has Diablo II.
<ThatsAShinySky> WOO

<Kammerjunk> That there are MLP/Diablo II crossovers anyway.
<CCCP> HOLY SHIT THAT STREAM SCARED THE SHIT OUTTA ME!!!!

<Jim> It's the mythbusters, they make mostly everything explode
<Everlasting_Joy> And what's wrong with that?
<MirrorImage> *especially* concrete trucks
<Meanwhile> Whale corpses have been known to explode because of decomposed insides.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3someone's going to be lighting a cigarrette there and blow themselves up
<Jim> Burning methane gass, fun
<Jim> I hate it when I forget that I parked my car behind a jet.

<MirrorImage> that's a Chrysler? Like hell it is
<Krakass> I love the video where the city government was trying to remove a dead beached whale with dynamite.
<MirrorImage> that's a poniac if anything
<Jim> Krakass: That sounds like the worst idea ever
<Dark_Horst> oh i do
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, trusting aint he
<Dark_Horst> but i still call bullshit on 25 meters
<Krakass> Looks like an intrepid.
<Everlasting_Joy> Way to date yourself show.

<Sumica> 00,10it's what I am not payed to do ^_^
<flutter_spin> whoa
<Dark_Horst> they're making an rc out of a full-sized car
<Jim> Why does mythbusters cars always have a failure?
<Everlasting_Joy> It's a cheap Pontiac, what do you expect Jamie?
<Dark_Horst> god, i want their job so fucking hard
<MirrorImage> Jim - because buying a proper failure-proof car would be a waste of money
<Sumica> 00,10You get what you payed for Jim
<flutter_spin> Why must cheap things fail?
<otakon> b
<Everlasting_Joy> *honk.
<otakon> bc that's how it works
<Sumica> 00,10and the copcar worked just fine
<Meanwhile> Someone built that car in a cave with a box of scraps. Damn right you get what you payed for.
<RainbowJack> piece of SH*T
<Jim> Yeah, they'd probably not want to destroy expensive cars ^^
<otakon> Meanwhile: okay, enough with the damn scraps joke
<Shizuka> 13have to admit
<Shizuka> 13doing donuts with a remote control cop car
<Shizuka> 13pretty awesome

<RAWRity> First up is: a Twilight Recolor called "Firecracker Burst"
<flutter_spin> I cheated. I went to the store and looked for the code. I knew what I was getting.
<Everlasting_Joy> It's because Jamie isn't human Adam. He's some kind of higher life form.
<Meanwhile> Walrus man.
<Dark_Horst> fashion concious like that, he would get along greatly with rarity
<RAWRity> Second is: APPLEJACK!
<Dark_Horst> i'M DARING YOU, SHIPPERS

<Meanwhile> The jet might become like a black hole. It could suck the car into it.
<otakon> yeah
<Jim> The insurance company must think Pinkie's driving
<otakon> IN BIZARRO LAND
<Shizuka> 13they apply for the mythbusters too... moron insurance...

<Dark_Horst> well, get bigger engines, no?
<otakon> Meanwhile: bumper usually
<RanDT2> Well it seems that the car was being taken apart o_o
<Dark_Horst> this, ladies and gentlemean, is why insurace companies suck ass
<Meanwhile> Clearly the answer is to get more engines.
<otakon> indeed
<flutter_spin> nice
<Jim> This needs about 20% more engines
<Meanwhile> And then it explodes.
<otakon> Jim: EXACTLY!
<otakon> and more shirtless guys
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that sad momment when the insurance company was kinda right
<Meanwhile> Not really.
<Jim> More shirtless guys and more bacon!
<RanDT2> mmmm bacon
<Shizuka> 13not with these engines anyway

<otakon> gesticulate HARDER Adam!
<Jim> Yeah, wave at them Adam, that'll help
<Meanwhile> Holy filly flip flops in a fridge.

<Jim> Stallion_of_War: Eeyup
<ofna01> WHO LIKES SPIDERS?
<Shizuka> 13having a black bee the size of your thumb fly two inches past your ear at the tender emotional age of seven sort of puts you off bugs forever
<otakon> not me

<Sumica> 00,10totaly understand that.
<Dark_Horst> hornets scare me
<ofna01> yeah,try being stung 3 times by a yellowjacket when your 2
<Dark_Horst> bees? naw
<otakon> Shizuka: ah, that explains it. Bees have NEVER bothered me though, ever. They actually like me.
<RoflBot> hornets are more scarier than spiders
<Meanwhile> BEeeeeeeeeeeeees
<Shizuka> 13we had a nest in our roof..
<Everlasting_Joy> *cue Nic Cage.
<Stallion_of_War> I wonder if Jimmy Hoffa was a stow-away aboard the TARDIS and got left behind on some alien planet
<ofna01> i kill Carpenter bees
<otakon> The only time I've been stung is when I bothered them and then only wasps or hornets.
<Stallion_of_War> that's probably what happened to him
<Meanwhile> Probably.
<otakon> Stallion_of_War: sounds like a good plot for a Dr. Who ep
*emangamer hugs Shizuka "How are you today?"
<ofna01> i had to kill carpenter bee's because they eat our shed
<ofna01> good thing they dont sting
<Meanwhile> Science!
<emangamer> ^
<RoflBot> ahh who doesnt love mythbusters
<Dark_Horst> when i was six i once closed my hand without noticing that a wasp flew into it at exact this moment. oh the pain
<Jim> We had a wasp nest in our brick wall, had to burn them out
<otakon> noone
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: a carpenter bee?
<Zappy> All in the name of SCIENCE!
<Dark_Horst> still not scared of bees though
<ofna01> VHAT HAS SHIENCE DONE?!?
<Dark_Horst> or wasps
<emangamer> Meanwhile: http://xkcd.com/54/
<ofna01> Saturn
<Sumica> 00,10they burrow in to wood Saturn
<ofna01> a carpenter bee is a bee with no stinger that burrows in wood
<Dark_Horst> holy bee
<Stallion_of_War> I bet he's under the other 10 yard line...
<ofna01> only FEMALE carpenter bee's have stinger,and they dont come out of the nest
<Shizuka> 13i don't know what it was
<Sumica> 00,10they are huge so far as bees go.
<emangamer> ofna01: you know too much about bees
<Meanwhile> Why would you bury a corpse where someone might find it anyway.
<emangamer> Shizuka: http://xkcd.com/54/
<ofna01> eman
<ofna01> i barley know anything
<Shizuka> 13i know it was massive, black, flying fast, and made that horrible BZZZIMGONNAKILLYOU noise
<ofna01> thats the only bee i know anything about
<Stallion_of_War> Meanwhile - Who would look under a football stadium for a corpse?
<Meanwhile> MC knows too many facts about bees.
<RoflBot> ya
<Stallion_of_War> I mean, besides the Mythbusters
<ofna01> what was so scary about it Shizu?
<otakon> Shizuka: it was a BEE! Bees don't bother you unless you swing at them
<Sumica> 00,10damit Shizuka I was taking a drink as I read that.
<otakon> ofna01: she was seven
<ofna01> is it poisonus or something?
<Meanwhile> Stallion_of_War: You say that while they're looking for in a football stadium for a corpse?
<RoflBot> we should watch a twilight zone episode sometime
<Stallion_of_War> But they're the Mythbusters
<Stallion_of_War> They defy logic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that dashie comic was good :'(
<ofna01> yeah,try sitting on a Yellow Jacket when your two
<emangamer> I know the feeling shizu....I crushed alunimum soda cans when I young and the soad ALWAYS attracted bees and now I cant STAND them...
<RoflBot> what dash comic?
<coperhawkeye> The new one on eqd im guessing?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<Stallion_of_War> Bah! two hours to kill and no cash for food :(
*emangamer hugs SlurryMoon <3
<emangamer> EVER!
<ofna01> lol i still have pencil lead in my leg from a few years back
<otakon> hiya SlurryMoon what's up?
<Stallion_of_War> Not that I could stomach fast food right now
*SlurryMoon huggles emangamer
<Jim> Try this at home you say Jamie?
<Meanwhile> There was a wasp nest in a metal bin at the local park when I was like, 12. We sprayed it full of deoderant and set it alight.
<Krakass> Lol, I have pencil lead in my foot.
<otakon> also, MOAR MYTHBUSTERS YAY!
<SlurryMoon> 3Hi, I"m just lurking.
<Shizuka> 13EVER
<emangamer> SlurryMoon: I haven't seen you in a while...where have you been?
<otakon> Meanwhile: that is cruel man
<Meanwhile> Cruel but effective.
<Stallion_of_War> I saw Kari!
<emangamer> Shizuka: inb4 JFK conspiracy
<ofna01> i acidentally stabbed myslef in the thigh and its still a black mark
<Everlasting_Joy> SlurryMoon you blew your lurking when you spoke.
<Jim> !
<Meanwhile> Besides, playing heads and volleys is hard to do when surrounded by wasps.
<ofna01> whasthat?
<MirrorImage> this a revisited episode?
<emangamer> Sumica: and THAT line made one of the best quotes ever
<coperhawkeye> He thinks like Pinkie Pie!
<Everlasting_Joy> Quack.
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: if it was a bee that was black, and it had a nest in your roof, it was almost certainly a kind of carpenter bee
<Stallion_of_War> I suppose I could go borrow headphones...
<Shizuka> 13that's great
<RoflBot> 6_9
<emangamer> MirrorImage: its the equivilant of a flashback episode for any other show
<Sumica> 00,10s2ep1 myths revisited
<otakon> but they're so big and fuzzy!
<MirrorImage> i know emangamer
<MirrorImage> i was wonder if this *was* a revisited episode
<ofna01> carpenter bee's are about 50 black 50 yellow
<otakon> bees don't bother me
<Saturn> 08,01actually, there is a kind of insect i'm not too fond of: wasps
<Ingwaz> Saturn: if its a bee at all, kill it with fire
<OneTrickPony> oh I remember this
<Meanwhile> I'm inclined to believe Shizuka doesn't care what kind of bee it was as long as it stays far far away.
<ofna01> their tails are black
<otakon> Wasps however I can't stand
<ofna01> everything else is yellow
<Krakass> Dat fig leaf.
<Saturn> 08,01i think they're lovely, and beautiful, but i'm kinda scared of them
<ofna01> WASPS ARE BITCHES
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: i *love* bees
<ofna01> they stung me to hell for no reason
<Saturn> 08,01i keep bees
<otakon> them and Hornets
<emangamer> Science, it works bitches
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, i used to keep bees
<RoflBot> honeybees are boss
<Sumica> 00,10Oh hi young tory
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: hornets are actually pretty docile
<Ingwaz> Saturn: ....thats a new one to me...unless you have a bee farm or something
<ofna01> Saturn
<KwakLad> but passing solid urine would be painful
<emangamer> TORY....he looks young
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: i used to have a coupl eof hives in my garden
<emangamer> KwakLad: not ACTUAL solid urine... /)_-
<otakon> Saturn: my ass, every time I've been around them the bastards try to sting me.
<ofna01> tell that to my couple dozen scars i have from wasps
<Jim> http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/faresende/BBzobJtjzhmEeehsiriItpzecCCAeIpIewFGJwoikqplGaJcycbuzvgJGoGo/media_httpiimgurcom1z_rzwyH.jpg.scaled500.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJFZAE65UYRT34AOQ&Expires=1329859090&Signature=f2E6wcj3ZZ63kjXDIt7nGU4IZhA%3D
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh Tory, soon you'd jump a wagon on a bike.
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: hornets or yellowjackets?
<Saturn> 08,01because yellowjackets are aggressive, but most other wasps and hronets aren't
<ofna01> oh god dont get me started on yellowjacket
<KwakLad> emangamer: i know i know, i would accept 'continuous' more than 'solid'
<otakon> Saturn: both, only bees don't bother me
<Meanwhile> I hit wasps with things.
<emangamer> otakon: you are always on the list of wasps shit
<Gold_Demona> Grant is best built team mythbuster.
<otakon> apparently emangamer and how are you today?
<Shizuka> 13things that small that fly that fast are perfectly capable of screwing up your week
<Dark_Horst> wasps aren't that dangerous
<ofna01> HAHAHA
<ofna01> dark
<Dark_Horst> there's always a few stray ones bothering your veranda breankfast
<Jim> Shirtless Jamie again
<Dark_Horst> they never sting
<ofna01> they can kill you if a whole swarm gets you
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: how are you about moths?
<Dark_Horst> shoo them away and everrything's fine
<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: true
<ofna01> i love moths and butterflys
<Shizuka> 13squish
<Saturn> 08,01but you'd need to be stung a *lot* of times
<Saturn> 08,01:(
<emangamer> One time I was following my brother through the woods and my brother stepped on a yellowjacket nest. The first thing the ENTIRE neest saw at once was me....I got about 110 stings that day
<Meanwhile> Dem anomalous readings.
*Saturn 08,01breeds moths
<Dark_Horst> well, sawrms only come at you if you're dumb enough to kick a nnest
<otakon> emangamer: damn man
<Dark_Horst> you don't kick waps nests
<MirrorImage> "...rectal?"
<ofna01> i just caught a moth last night
<Sumica> 00,10adams face when.

<RoflBot> hehe
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon I believe she was in an earlier episode, but I can't recall.
<Krakass> I thought her first episode was the one where they made the mold of her butt.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<emangamer> Saturn: the problem is that they dont have their wings like that hardly of the time
<ofna01> or a Rustic Sphinx, Manduca rustica

<Jim> Pee on an electric rail they said. It'll be fun they said.
<emangamer> lol...
<Meanwhile> Yeah but realistically have you ever peed in public? You damn sure get as close as possible to the target surface to minimise chances of anyone noticing.
<emangamer> dat...physique..
<coperhawkeye> Is anything ever confirmed?
<Krakass> Nothing like getting a friend to pee on an electric fence.
<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: that looks like a rustic sphinx to me
<CountDoofus> Meanwhile, Jim, PinkiePieCopy: any suggestions for improvement on that drawing at all?

<Saturn> 08,01ofna01: awesome!

<Meanwhile> Because it works like that.
<robotdragon6> i saw this episode
<Dark_Horst> "oh and that one day i got splattered with dough and thought my brains were leaking out"
*Stallion_of_War we're watching science and I just learned Wilfred is, still alive (/Portal)
<Dark_Horst> i was fully concious with my brains in my hands but, hey"
*emangamer is a hot cady always
<Meanwhile> I wonder if they laughed about that later.
<Krakass> Family Guy's take on him and his diabeetus is funny.
<Shizuka> 13oh hey, earl is the car they drop for buster 2.0 isn't it
<Dark_Horst> there are STUPID people out there
<Meanwhile> Remember when you thought your brain fell out? Funny stuff.

*Everlasting_Joy brohoof Aircrafter.
<robotdragon6> i just beat god of war 3 =p
<unfoundbug> kinematics, i like them
<emangamer> Saturn: today in physics we were working with transformers and magnetic currents...its amazing that you can get an ELECTRICAL current out of something that is not connected to any electrical sorce at all
<Stallion_of_War> source
<Jim> Dat induction
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: actually, the rule is "Video links and links to outside sites are not allowed unless you are given permission by the mod staff."

<RoflBot> 6_9
<Saturn> 08,01hey shizuka, can i have your permission to post a link to EqD in the past?
<unfoundbug> emangamer, im currently writing a multi-threaded networked physics simulator
<Jim> I still remember the right hand rule
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okay settle down now. Let the mods do the modding, just enjoy the stream
<otakon> FIRE THE SCOOTALOOS'S!
