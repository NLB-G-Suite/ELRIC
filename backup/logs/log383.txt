<Saturn> 08,01so yeah, it's gonna be late
<Theoboldi> PLay heavy. All you need to do is get a medic and aim in the general direction of the enemy.
<MirrorImage> "Quick, shoot him while he's monolog-ARGH!"
<mario_pony> why you no say bye to Zappy!?!?!
<RaveBrony> Whats it about again?

<Saturn> 08,01oh nice, FMA!
<CupcakeWarrior> Shit's getting real now
<Tovler> damn… I should have watched that "movie" before a new pony episode aired.
<Saturn> 08,01pitty i can't watch it right now
<unfoundbug> RaveBrony i just PMd you a link you might find interesting
<PinkiePieCopy> Scout? Hard as hell to hit. Soldier? Destroys your damn everything. Medic? Shoots needles and heals people, and stabs people.
<September> LOL OLD MAN
<RaveBrony> :o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i case you don't know i like medic~
<flutter_spin> oh my.
<otakon> ;__:
<Meanwhile> Heavy is fine when he has support, and getting stuck in close quarters with one is ghastly, but otherwise yeah, heavy is a whoppin big target
<otakon> Armstrong, poor Armstrong
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> medic stab people ?
<September> I hate Blutsauger battle medics that know what they're doing.
<September> Scare the hell outt ame.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you will hate me September ~
<PinkiePieCopy> Pyro? Global warming.
<CriticKitten> They've got....hungry eyeeeeees~
<CupcakeWarrior> WHOA
<PinkiePieCopy> Medics can stab people... Ubersaw? Bonesaw? Duh.
<flutter_spin> a letter to Celestia ASAP
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i love my blutsauger~
<otakon> oh god EVEN THEN!
<LadyCanary> ...Oh man. THAT GUY
<September> Pyro has come to be known as the F2P terror.
<ThatsAShinySky> CCan you do this for me?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^^
<CriticKitten> Hughes. ;-;
<Meanwhile> Pyro has a small head.
<September> Is this a flashback? I thought Hughes was dead.
<ThatsAShinySky> Oh.my.gosh.
<RaveBrony> I take it Pyro is the guy that always burns me to death -_-
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep flashback
<RAWRity> HUGHES! SHOW US PICTURES OF YOUR FUTURE DAUGHTER!
<ThatsAShinySky> Sorry!
<Mutterguy> the Dear john letter
<Tovler> wait, is this FMA or Brotherhood?
<Sumica> 00,10backblasting a rocket is fun as a pyro too.
<CriticKitten> September: Flashback to the Ishbalan Extermination
<RAWRity> brotherhood
<flutter_spin> Brotherhood
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> brotherhood
<September> Hughes had an anticlimactic end: Blown up in a Phonebooth.
<PinkiePieCopy> Spy? Kinda shit.
<Tovler> I never did see the original FMA
<RAWRity> September: shot in a phone booth*
<CupcakeWarrior> That explains why I dont remember this episode
<Meanwhile> Clearly you don't know how to stealth PinkiePieCopy.
<PinkiePieCopy> Heavy? STillkinda shit..
<September> Dat Hawkeye.
<flutter_spin> wow. His speech just got epic.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica: i found hard as hell to airblast rockets D:
<unfoundbug> Sumica, backblast kills are by far my favorite method of killing
<otakon> Riza Hawkeye>Sniper
<PinkiePieCopy> I do..
<otakon> sexy
<September> LOL.
<flutter_spin> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> dat eye catch
<PinkiePieCopy> There shit because people know to spycheck
<flutter_spin> full metal... uhhhh
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Okay?
<Shadowpony0071> SHES BRINGING SEXY BACK
<ThatsAShinySkyz> Fuck.
<Sumica> 00,10I killed wrek by backblasting a stack of nades at him.
<otakon> ofc Kimbley would say that
<CriticKitten> Go burn, Kimblee!
<CriticKitten> D:<
<Meanwhile> PinkiePieCopy: real stealth means not being in the location of spycheckers.
<RaveBrony> Woah!! How do you get cool stuff like the people in this vid have??
*otakon punches Kimblee
<RAWRity> dat Kimbley
<Sumica> 00,10he then proceeded to curb stomp me for the rest of the match.
<RaveBrony> Lighted gun, top hat, etc O.o
<Meanwhile> To truly stealth you do what every good assassin has done since the begninning of time. Take the target from behind!
<flutter_spin> oh snap
<PinkiePieCopy> Actually, stealth runs out...
<unfoundbug> wrek is VERY good at demo and sniper
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sumica: you are a great pyro BTW not just w+m1 but a good one
<Shadowpony0071> MISS SEXY SNIPER
<Shadowpony0071> lulz
<Meanwhile> PinkiePieCopy: Get a cloak and dagger.
<PinkiePieCopy> And Pyros spycheck everything like hell
<PinkiePieCopy> I have one
<SonicRainboom> Hey, everypony.
<Sumica> 00,10I dont think I am that great at it.
<Meanwhile> PinkiePieCopy: ok so back to point one, you don't know how to stealth :P
<PinkiePieCopy> I do
<DaringDude> im learning to snipe
<flutter_spin> The epic questioning of being a soldier.
<Meanwhile> If you did you wouldn't be complaining.
*flutter_spin grabs more popcorn.
<PinkiePieCopy> It's just that i'm playing agains people with about 50 stranges, unusuals, etc
<DaringDude> but i cant have friends because i havent actually bought anything yet
<CupcakeWarrior> BOOM
<PinkiePieCopy> And 5 years of EXP
<PinkiePieCopy> mostly
<SonicRainboom> What is this?
<CriticKitten> Dem horrifying experiments
<otakon> oh god
<PinkiePieCopy> FMA
<otakon> ded
<SonicRainboom> Oh.
<emangamer> hey Wrek what was the name of that "halls of moria" song?
<CupcakeWarrior> Brotherhppd
<PinkiePieCopy> DO A DAMN BARREL ROLL
<Meanwhile> Well that's unpleasant.
<Kipkat07> oh dear
<otakon> yh, Marcoh is not happy with this
<AllisZero> Oh hai ponies.
<flutter_spin> steamroller.
<otakon> hiya AllisZero
<Capn_fisty> games bigger than ~7v7 tend to not be all that fun for me in tf2
<otakon> Zolf? kickass first name
*AllisZero hugs otakon
*otakon hugs AllisZero
<Wottertheotter> Oh cool FMA
<unfoundbug> Crowd mentality on larger games make the objective pretty low priority usually
*PinkiePieCopy tackles AllisZero
<unfoundbug> though the pony servers are usually pretty good
<CriticKitten> Kimblee is such a thorough monster. ._.
*AllisZero is tackled!
<flutter_spin> ok, I'm getting lost in the story. Does someone want to summarize?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i hate when there is a haevy at full health just sitting around yelling medic D:
<Meanwhile> I hate it when anyone at full health yells medic -_-
*Theoboldi whistles innocently
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol
<Meanwhile> Sorry scout I'm healing someone who needs it.
<Meanwhile> Now get out of my face before I take your temperature with this bonesaw.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i like to keep everyone overhealed for as long as i can~
<Sumica> 00,10then you will hate me as i bump my E key alot when strafeing >_<
<unfoundbug> TheGreatAndPowerfulT a heavy is pretty poor without a dedicated healer
<PinkiePieCopy> Healing a a Heavy as a Medic? You should. THe Heavy will protect you and you both can win one for your team.
<Capn_fisty> likewise sumica
<unfoundbug> i generally switch from heavy if there are no medics on the team
<unfoundbug> they are too big of a target
<PinkiePieCopy> Over 9,00
<Theoboldi> unfoundbug ditto
<unfoundbug> a heavy at 300 is not at full health
<Meanwhile> I can't play heavy.
<RAWRity> dude, he has the title of Fuhrer. Why would you expect him to be merciful?
<flutter_spin> So let me get this straight. He is killing... for fun?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kinda~
<PinkiePieCopy> Heavy's health cna go up to 350 with Dalhokas Bar
<Meanwhile> I can play everything else to at least capable degree, but for some reason heavy just doesn't go my way.
<PinkiePieCopy> And it' infinate, unlike Sandvich.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<otakon> I use the heavy fairly well
<DaringDude> does anyone know the ip for wreks server
<CriticKitten> flutter_spin: The war was perpetuated with a much worse purpose in mind than thar
<CriticKitten> *that
<otakon> plus, he's my fave character
<PinkiePieCopy> I use the Pyro, Scout, and Soldier.
<PinkiePieCopy> And Engineer.
<Capn_fisty> wrek isnt hosting a server atm
<Sumica> 00,10it's not up right now DaringDude
<unfoundbug> i do love heavy on the slower games, but on a fast game of payload hes basically useless
<DaringDude> i know
<pony_7690> 46.236.85.221
<DaringDude> but for future reference
<Meanwhile> I use whatever the team is missing. Unless it's missing a heavy, because screw that.
<CupcakeWarrior> Is the blonde one a girl?
<flutter_spin> Ok, cause I thought he was doing it to defend his country, then I thought maybe it was to find some treasure, then to absorb power..
<DaringDude> ty pony
<flutter_spin> Now it just feels like he was doing it ... to test loyalty? or something
<Sumica> 00,10yes Hawkeye is a girl.
<Sumica> 00,10and a sniper
<Capn_fisty> I pyro or engie and sometimes demoman if im feeling saucy
<CupcakeWarrior> She looks like a guy
<PinkiePieCopy> Hey, how cna you fix a black-screened-TF2?
<PinkiePieCopy> Mine is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i can't demopan
<CriticKitten> He was doing it because he and the Homonculus are causing wars on purpose
<unfoundbug> demo is pretty good once you manage the reload
<AllisZero> Riza Hawkeye with her hair down is POMF
<Meanwhile> Capn_fisty: oh my.
<flutter_spin> Or do the guys just look like girls?
<unfoundbug> and turn on auto-reloading
<Tovler> Maria looks more like a guy than Riza
<flutter_spin> what purpose? ... you find out later on, do ya?
<Capn_fisty> That fisty isnt punching ;)
<RaveBrony> Hey!! Do hats give power-ups? Or what?
<PinkiePieCopy> No
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: no.
<AllisZero> In a world filled with anime girls showing so much skin and having no personalities, Riza is a rare but welcome sight.
<PinkiePieCopy> They are just useless items
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope unleass they are part of a set
<RaveBrony> Where do you get them? mods?
<flutter_spin> heh heh .. sniper sight
<Meanwhile> Hats are purely to make you look like you have a hat.
<PinkiePieCopy> No, you buy them..
<Capn_fisty> degreaser set is fun
<RaveBrony> Oh :o
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: you either craft them or find them randomly.
<PinkiePieCopy> Did you download TF2 yesterday?
<RaveBrony> Yeah :)
<Meanwhile> Note that your chances to just find a hat are immensely low.
<CupcakeWarrior> Eririku
<CriticKitten> Dat crush
<flutter_spin> again with the height issue
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i want the medic bird mask or whatevers~
<CupcakeWarrior> she came
*RaveBrony is a Complete Noob at TF2 :S

<PinkiePieCopy> Oh....

<flutter_spin> Maybe they should have just gotten a cooler robot
<Meanwhile> I'm content to wear Bills hat forever.
<LadyCanary> Hi Morty!

<ekips> well, I'm getting to bed now, good night and have fun everypony!

<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: how tall're you?
<unfoundbug> its all about practice and asking
*flutter_spin sucks at TF2.
<otakon> night Tarku take it easy
<RaveBrony> But also, since you all are answering questions. How do you play with swords like Wrek? :o
<PinkiePieCopy> Rave just download it, it'll be on your games once you have TF2. (And you do)
<Sumica> 00,10it's a map type RaveBrony
<RAWRity> *zipper

<flutter_spin> I've tried TF2, but I get one-shotted before I even notice someone coming my way. Too fast :(
<unfoundbug> RaveBrony, an idea is to go on a TDM server for a bit, see how the classes interact in a team
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Well, I'm 5'4. So you might beat me.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I hear you all liek Mudkipz

<RaveBrony> ^
<Tovler> Wrek doesn't mind.
<RaveBrony> Is there a Vinyl scratch fromthe blindbags??
<unfoundbug> Wrek hasnt said that though
<Meanwhile> ^
<Tovler> It's only bad during episodes and movies and whatnot.

<Meanwhile> Wrek, do you mind?
<RainbowDashisbestpon> so whos drawing this pic?
<Gumri> Wrek draws very good.

<Sumica> 00,10CountDoofus2 it gets teh job done.
<Meanwhile> Night of Pony, courtesy of an escapist post.
<Zappy> Curiosity
<September> Lmao I just read a newspaper article that a legally declared insane has painted 6 of his horses in resemblence of the Mane 6.
<Zappy> and youtube
<MASF123> Youtube did
<Randomnerd> My friend in Albany.
<Sumica> 00,10Youtube+eps
<dr-whooves> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=O_Q6M6pO_2s
<DashingRainbow> Hell yeaaah, Youtube.
<Meanwhile> September: insane people can own horses?
<unfoundbug> bronies.memebase, saw it, was funny, watched season 1 without sleeping
<dr-whooves> This video did it for
<dr-whooves> me
<Jaegerpony> -/mlp is 4chan giving up against the pony
<unfoundbug> watched every week since
<CCCP> actually a magizene got me interested in bronies
<CountDoofus2> cause I've been trying to trade a crate with TheGreatAndPowerfulT for fifteen minutes, no dice no way
<CriticKitten> September: I can beat that. I read an article discussing a rare genetic disorder that turns a person's skin blue.
<RainbowDashisbestpon> i saw it on tv one day wondered what it was saw it was MLP and i thought: wow an MLP i like? YouTube here i come.
<Meanwhile> Give in to the herd. Resistance is futile.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<September> Meanwhile he was claimed insane after someone saw he was painting a horse in rainbow colors
<CriticKitten> And one of the people who had this disease was a women who lived into her late 80s. Her name was Luna.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> bad luck D: steam hates me it seems
<Meanwhile> September: in many ways that's exactly how it should work.
<MASF123> Meanwhile, there really is no escape from the hers, I know I tried and failed miserably
<Gumri> I am really looking forward to Serenity tomorrow, best film ever. (Yes i'm a browncoat)
<MASF123> herd
<CCCP> I first heard about bronies and thought it was a joke
<Jaegerpony> lol flutterpunk
<CriticKitten> When I saw that, it took everything I had not to burst out laughing at it
<dr-whooves> WHATs evryponies favorite 8 or 16 bit Game
<September> Super Mario Bros.
<Gumri> ^
<dr-whooves> Be specific
<dr-whooves> which one
<RainbowDashisbestpon> 8 bit: Terraria
<Gumri> No actually pokemon silver
<mario_pony> the very first one
<SonicRainboom> I'm too busy watching ponies to play video games.
<Paradise92> damn...
<September> Either that or Adventure Island
<Meanwhile> Pokemon Gold.
<Capn_fisty> i saw pony memes and wanted to know where they came from so i downloaded S1 around last september/october
<CCCP> hmmmmmm...... Super mario World or Supeer mario bros 3 or Super Metroid
<DashingRainbow> Mine's probably SMB or Pokemon.
<Zappy> 16 bit: Donkey Kong Country SNES
<MASF123> 8-bit, Super Mario Bros. EWJ for 16-bit
<September> Seriously, has anyone heard of Adventure Island for NES?
<CCCP> oh and any classic pokemon game
<mario_pony> CCCP: super mario bros 3!
<unfoundbug> fluttershy looks great with a mohawk
<dr-whooves> You guys are cool
<dr-whooves> and never heard of it
<CCCP> mario_pony: :D amazing game

<Meanwhile> Dashie_Dashie: your sorry is irrelevant, no non image links.

<Dashie_Dashie> Listen to the song and then tell me that
<Dashie_Dashie> ;)
<CCCP> definatly not hotel mario
<Capn_fisty> meanwhile, while meanwhile trolls the rules
<Meanwhile> Dashie_Dashie: song is also irrelevant.
<September> Exact Plot to all current mario games: Stomp shit, Collect Shit, Fight Turtle, No secks with princess. Credits w/ flacidity.
<Jaegerpony> does it count if you just paste after the /watch ?
<mario_pony> CCCP: *shivers*
<RainbowDashisbestpon> avast fluttershy's ass would fit as a perfect song for this drawing. :)
<DashingRainbow> ....Good idea o.e
<Capn_fisty> what are the avast asses things
<Jaegerpony> hair is a bit purply?
<September> *immediately thinks of

<MASF123> Gnight KwakLad
<DashingRainbow> Some.
<Meanwhile> MASF123: if something exists, someone somwhere is attracted to it.
<dr-whooves> There willl be creeps in evry fandom
<Tovler> Well, you have to admit, the ponies are appealing.
<CCCP> MASF123: i think thats a myth
<Capn_fisty> Yeah that R34
<DashingRainbow> Eeyup.
<dr-whooves> If it exist s its a fetish no exeptions
<CCCP> NO FUCK R34!!!
<unfoundbug> No r34 chat
<dr-whooves> see the rules of the internet
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<RainbowDashisbestpon> depends on the picture but the normal look of them from the series, no.
<dr-whooves> Irts not rule 34
<dr-whooves> its rule 187
<emangamer> CCCP: thats a little excessive...
<mario_pony> we need to stop that rule!!!!!
<dr-whooves> i think
*Tovler embraces this freaky fandom.
<September> 187?
<Dashie_Dashie> I'd love to show Rainbow Dash my rock music play list.
<September> Whats that.
<Dashie_Dashie> she would be pleased.
<DashingRainbow> Which rule is 34? Humanized?
<dr-whooves> Porn of it
<Gumri> There is a massive subreddit called r/clopclop dedicated to r34 poni
<LadyCanary> Can we NOT talk about that.
<DashingRainbow> OH.
<Meanwhile> You can't stop Rule 34 without impeeding freedom of creativity.
<MASF123> I went to The Brony Network and found the chatters posting links of seductive pony pics and they were clopping to it
<Dashie_Dashie> Rule 34: if it exists, there is porn of it, no exceptions.
<Capn_fisty> well, i like slugbox's less ..erm, exposed pony stuff
<dr-whooves> Rule 87 if it exists there is ponies of it
<CCCP> emangamer: i understand that there are creeps out there but what if a little girls looked up MLP on imagaes?
<DashingRainbow> R34 can suck it e_e
<Meanwhile> People will draw what they want and the best you can do is to get over it.
<Dashie_Dashie> the actual Rule
<Jaegerpony> no talky rules
<mario_pony> EVERYPONY STOP!!!!
<LadyCanary> Um...can we NOT talk about R34.

<Meanwhile> Calm down everypony.
<Gumri> Yeah lets stop 34'ing
<mario_pony> no talking about it!!!!!
<Jaegerpony> happy thoughts ^^
<dr-whooves> Listen to meanwhile
<DashingRainbow> Which rule is the humanized ponies?
<Dashie_Dashie> I was just stating what the actual rule was for the misinformed.
*LadyCanary stretches
<Tovler> I need to find this forum. This place is too stiff and huffy.
<Zappy> drop the 34 nonsense, please.

<dr-whooves> @wrek gimme the link to this song
<Meanwhile> Yfw no one has used this room in like a day.
<Jaegerpony> Wants the shades
<Gumri> ugh
<Kammerjunk> DashingRainbow: I'm a bit late, but oh well.
<DashingRainbow> Awesome song.
<MirrorImage> jffry890 - the new episode is getting pushed back by 2 hours now
<unfoundbug> wub wub wub
<Sumica> 00,10dat yelowline
<Meanwhile> Now wake up. And stay awake.
<LadyCanary> Oonz oonz oonz oonz
<emangamer> what is the classification for someone being a BG pony
<Wrek> 05now there
<Kammerjunk> DashingRainbow: Twilight is my favourite pony, followed by Trixie.
<dr-whooves> Crazy TRAIN!
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
<DashingRainbow> I'm still tired. XD
<Sumica> 00,10uunce uunce uunce
<RainbowDashisbestpon> YES IT SOUNDS LIKE VINYAL GOT HERE JUST IN TIME
<Wrek> 05DAT is a properly drawn mane
<Dashie_Dashie> unce unce unce unce unce unce unce
<MirrorImage> emangamer - their existence is nothing more than scene filler
*LadyCanary dances
<MASF123> Oh, I;m too sexy for my shirt
<Jaegerpony> limited airtime/speaking part
<Zappy> That's much better.
<DashingRainbow> Wrek that is an amazing mane <3
<Sumica> 00,10I need to stream some readline again.
<Gumri> orf orf orf orf clap ord clap ord clap atatatatattaattatat daawaawawwaw
<Meanwhile> For the time being, Fluttermohawk is best mohawk.
<DashingRainbow> Amazing ponehh.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Oh, well. I wasn't planning on sleeping any time soon anyway.
<unfoundbug> fluttershy needs to switch to having a mohawk
<emangamer> MirrorImage: well vinyl scratch has been given a name by the hub.
<dr-whooves> nah i got to sleep soon
<MirrorImage> after WE gave it to her first
<RainbowDashisbestpon> that mane is wow words cant describ its beauty<3
<dr-whooves> gnight guyz
<Dashie_Dashie> I was honestly expecting HEYEAHAYAH when I first herd that drum/snare
<Gumri> Oh it is this song lol
<MirrorImage> never said Vinyl wasn't a background pony
<Tovler> just 2 more hours until I can sleep.
<MirrorImage> she's an ascended extra
<Zappy> I swear I heard this song before...
<Jaegerpony> Well VS is DJ Pon3 on stage, right
<DashingRainbow> Yes
<MASF123> Vinyl Scratch is DJ PON-3
<MirrorImage> essentially
<DashingRainbow> They're the same, yeah
<LadyCanary> Brb for a bit
<Sumica> 00,10Fluttershy looks like she belongs in readline with that mane
<MASF123> Yes got renamed by the fans and it became her offical DJ name
<MirrorImage> a background pony can have a name, but if their existence serves no direct story purpose, then they're background
<SonicRainboom> Derpy was originally a background bpony , too.
<DashingRainbow> Vinyl is DJ P0N-3 when she DJ's basically...
<SonicRainboom> *pony
<mario_pony> ditzy doo used to be derpys name
<jffry890> derpy is a background pony
<MirrorImage> Vinyl and Octavia may be filling specific roles, but their existence doesn't necessarily forward the episode
<Tovler> aw man, I should have pointed and laughed at the prudes from here. But the freakout has passed.
<Meanwhile> Pony should pony pony.
<DashingRainbow> Ponyception.
<MirrorImage> at least not in a way that another pony doing the same thing couldn't further equally well
<jffry890> so whats wrek drawing?
<Meanwhile> Forever prudish.
<Jaegerpony> we need epic dance off episode
<Dark_Horst> but derpy's a hiogher ranked background
<jffry890> looks like fluttershy with purple hair
<Meanwhile> Derpy is the mascot of Bronydom.
<Wrek> 05purple?
<Wrek> 05PURPLE
<Dark_Horst> tlaking earns you a promotion
<Wrek> 05ITS FUCKIGN PIUIIIIINK

<Jaegerpony> pink is... softer
<Meanwhile> It's...mostly pink.
<RainbowDashisbestpon> PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNK
<jffry890> pink is redish. this is bluish
<DashingRainbow> I personally see pink.
<Dark_Horst> someone needs their spectral perception slapped right
<operatorpony> HI everypony
<DashingRainbow> OHAI
<Tovler> My beard laughs at your weak constitutions.
<Meanwhile> This song makes me think of Biker Mice from Mars.
<Zappy> Hi operatorpony.
<MASF123> Color Blindness
<CCCP> hi DashingRainbow
<Jaegerpony> highlights are pink
<emangamer> RainbowDashisbestpon: you better think before you mess with the pink...
<jffry890> <-- color deficient yet allowed to join marine corps
<Dark_Horst> this is pink. pink is not defined by softness
<Wrek> 05lookign at the percentages of the colour wheel that pink is more red than blue
<Meanwhile> As does my moustache.
<DashingRainbow> Hi CCCP
<RainbowDashisbestpon> :[ IT'S PINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!ELEVEN
<Jaegerpony> low lights are purple

<DashingRainbow> Thereforeit'smostlypink
<Gumri> Pink.

<Dark_Horst> Pirple!
<unfoundbug> Sumica could be worse, could be set up, but too late to use it
<SonicRainboom> Aren't layers amaing?
*Tovler is now shaving is head so that people look at his beard more.
<jffry890> idc but i want my punk rock sims 3 daughter to have that color/highlights
<Meanwhile> Erryday i'm layerin.
<Jaegerpony> lol
<Brony4Life> youre really good at this
<Meanwhile> Why not stick a sign to your face that says "LOOK AT MY FACIAL HAIR"
<DashingRainbow> What program is Wrek using?
<SonicRainboom> Lag....
<CCCP> do a barrle roll
<Jaegerpony> I remember when PSP didn't have layers
<emangamer> fun fact. Magenta is NOT a color
<CountDoofus> Dash: SAI
<DashingRainbow> Ah, mmk.
<MASF123> Lol @Meanwhile
<DashingRainbow> Magenta's not a color? Dafuq?
<jffry890> you should gimme the base and highlight color code thingy
<Jaegerpony> and when PSP meant Paintshop Pro
<Sumica> 00,10it's easly fixed unfoundbug, I set it up. then I stream redline after wrek is done.
<Shizuka> 13fun fact, magenta is the correct term for #FFFF00
<Dark_Horst> well, i'm quite sure magenta is NOT a pinapple
<Tovler> I can't find any sweaters that say that.
<Shizuka> 13er
<Shizuka> 13#FF00FF
<emangamer> DashingRainbow: there is not color on the spectrum between red and purple
<SonicRainboom> Must have been hell.
<Jaegerpony> FFFFFOOO!!!!!!
<emangamer> therefor it is not a REAL color
<DashingRainbow> That is weeeeeeird.
<CCCP> Who would win in a fight Fluttershy or Twilight?
<Meanwhile> Magenta, the word for fuchsia when you can't spell fuchsia.
<Jaegerpony> sounds like a not-swear word
<emangamer> funfact I love Shizuka
<Tovler> Maybe if I braid my beard- wait, I won't do that.
<emangamer> DashingRainbow:
<Sumica> 00,10everyone loves Shizuka
<emangamer> http://www.biotele.com/magenta.html
<SonicRainboom> Irrelevant.
<Sumica> 00,10but must be willing to face the wrath of Vivi
<DashingRainbow> Too lazy to click links atm.
<emangamer> Meanwhile: magenta is not in the color spectrum
<DashingRainbow> Lol
<MASF123> I think I like Reading Rainbow because of RD
<Brony4Life> CCCP Fluttershy she has her animals
<emangamer> Sumica: truer words have never been spoken
<Meanwhile> emangamer: tell somepony who cares.
<unfoundbug> dede dumdum dede dumdumdedumdum
<DashingRainbow> Yes MASF xD
<Zappy> I REALLY LIKE HER MANE.
<emangamer> Meanwhile: I cares...
<Meanwhile> emangamer: forever alone.
<jffry890> well im free for the next 15 min
<DashingRainbow> C'mon, Meanwhile..
<emangamer> ^
<DashingRainbow> Let's be nice here :{
<Shizuka> 13emangamer: magenta can't be made by a single wavelength no, but it is a distinct color
<jffry890> bastards kicked me outta the bg cuz i was wasnt playing n on stream instead
<SonicRainboom> Reading is now 20% cooler.
<CountDoofus> now now, let's stay nice
<Shizuka> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magenta
<emangamer> Shizuka: http://www.biotele.com/magenta.html thats what I read...
<emangamer> and I heard it somewhere else too
<MASF123> Meanwhile, Meanwhile gets pinged twice
<Meanwhile> I can't be nice all the time. It's hard enough trying to do it as long as I'm in here.
<Shizuka> 13for instance i think the technical term for the color i'm using is also magenta, though putty puts it closer to pink
<DashingRainbow> :\
<DashingRainbow> Just try :{
<Meanwhile> Fact is I'm not a nice person.
<Dark_Horst> oh green, you anomaly, you
<Sumica> 00,10what are you an art dictonary?
<Jaegerpony> oooh green dot
<Dark_Horst> you guys should read this
<MASF123> Sweetie Belle? Where?
<DashingRainbow> Green be my favorite color.
<unfoundbug> heh, anyone else think of the telnet application when Shizuka mentioned putty?
<CCCP> gotta go right now
<jffry890> so not pink and not purple
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wow... I've learned something today! ^_^
<Gumri> Purple is best colour.
<jffry890> her hairs magenta/fuschia
<DashingRainbow> Wheeew.
<Shizuka> 13that.... would be exactly it unfoundbug....
<CountDoofus> MASF123: wow. had to think to get that one
<Jaegerpony> hmmm
<Meanwhile> Blue is best colour.
<Jaegerpony> print screen it
<jffry890> BLACK is best
<MASF123> Lol. CountDoofus what a name
<DashingRainbow> LOL
<jffry890> absolute nothing
<mario_pony> RED is best color!!!!!!
<Jaegerpony> sample the colour in paint programme
<DashingRainbow> CountDoofus, as soon as you said that, I got it too.
<Jaegerpony> check hexadecimal code
<jffry890> white is best cuz its EVERY color
<SonicRainboom> Blue is best olor.
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony and blue is best colour.
<SonicRainboom> *color
<mario_pony> red
<Jaegerpony> Dash is blue
<SonicRainboom> Meanwhile, no.
<Gumri> Oh god damn it's 2am, completely lost track of time. Bye everyone!
<emangamer> Shizuka: did you know, the more you fear spiders, the larger they appear to be?
<SonicRainboom> RD is best pony.
<DashingRainbow> Rainbow Dash is best pony, rainbow is best color.
*Gumri rolls out of chat
<jffry890> lol gumri
<Meanwhile> SonicRainboom: your opinion is WRONG.
<unfoundbug> why do we have to name things such as colours, cant re just refer to them in hex codes
<CountDoofus> bye Gumri
<Zappy> Bye Gumri.
<unfoundbug> no ambiguity then
<Jaegerpony> night/morning Gumri
<Sumica> 00,10Armour is best armor
<DashingRainbow> Bye Gumri
<MASF123> DashingRainbow is best pony
<SonicRainboom> No.
<DashingRainbow> <3
<Brony4Life> DashingRainbow: I agree strongly

<DashingRainbow> Hurr

<Dashie_Dashie> I went with colors. xD
<Sumica> 00,10like I am not?
<mario_pony> 7:09am
<Meanwhile> It's easier to cheat if you cheat creatively.
<Jaegerpony> only cos non creative people can't think up decent excuses/stories
<Meanwhile> EEexactly.
<Dashie_Dashie> Lyra = sumica colors, bon bon = somewhat Shizuka colors
<Tovler> Nice. Bronies were mentioned in the newest Rifftrax.
<Terok> 3:09 am here -.-
<Shizuka> 13so really neither of us are asking why we're up making chocolate pudding
<Shizuka> 13we just are
<Dark_Horst> holy shit.... the PINK IS A LIE!:O
<DashingRainbow> ...Anyone heard of Equestria Online?
<Jaegerpony> yay choc pud
<CountDoofus> I won't ask if you share
<Meanwhile> Heard of it DashingRainbow. Only keep up to date with it's rare EQD postings.
<Jaegerpony> pinkie pie is hot pink
<DashingRainbow> Yeahh...
<MASF123> Shuzuka is a very pretty pony. :$
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pink.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03pfft, I lost control of my life at 3 in the morning once~
<DashingRainbow> And also, they dont post a lot of updates e_e
<Tovler> Maybe I'd were a light pink tie.
<Shizuka> 136am is when i realize i have lost control
<jffry890> pinkamena... *covers face from potential punchs*
<Dark_Horst> what if.... we onnly THINK we see pinkie pie?
<Brony4Life> its harder to read the text that has color overlay its easier to read the one thats just colored text itself
<Dashie_Dashie> Confound these ponies, they drive me to make pudding at 4 in the morning.
<DashingRainbow> Pinkamena is fuck yes.
<September> 4 AM Shizuka
<Jaegerpony> pudding!
<emangamer> Shizuka: "What your eye actually sees as pink is a combination of red and blue light, or, to put it another way, the full light spectrum with the green light removed."
<DashingRainbow> Pinkamena is best fanfic pony.
<Meanwhile> I once lost control of my life at midnight. I went outside and walked for 3 hours. I woke up on a bench in another village.
<DashingRainbow> Hey, Wrek?
<Shizuka> 13yes emangamer, but that doesn't mean it's not a color .-.
<Capn_fisty> 4am is where i decide to stay up because i will not get out of bet in time for anything in the morning
<jffry890> my minecraft skin is pinkamena lol. i go back n forth from shadowbolt
<MASF123> %Shizuka is a very pretty pony in that picture. :$
<jffry890> or gir
<Capn_fisty> bed*
<Brony4Life> this picture is fantasticly amazing and 20% cooler
<Meanwhile> Dat hair.
<Sumica> 00,10I think my colors are a bit more great and powerfull then lyra's
<DashingRainbow> Wrek, if you can read this, can you draw Pinkamena sometime?
<Shizuka> 13also i try to never be still awake past 6am... hazarding a system crash being up that long...
<Zappy> Brony4Life: More like 120% cooler!
<jffry890> wrek are you drawing a random pony or is just fluttershy with different hair
<Brony4Life> yeah
<DashingRainbow> Jiff he's drawing Flutttershy...
<DashingRainbow> I don't see what's wrong with the hair o.e
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't say that hair is different.
<CountDoofus> LOL! Look what I found: http://derpy.me/tu1V9
<Brony4Life> jffry890: my Minecraft skin is the Nyan cat
<Zappy> No qualms with the hair so far.
<DashingRainbow> The reason it may look purple-ish is because Wrek is making it look like shading.
<DashingRainbow> I like it. o.e
<Meanwhile> lol CountDoofus.
<emangamer> CountDoofus: thats pretty great
<Capn_fisty> my mc skin is flutterborn
<jffry890> i love the hair but i was just wondering what he was drawing
<DJ_Pon3> why am i am watching this if its not saturday
<jffry890> btw im still waiting for the hex codes for base/highlights
<Brony4Life> is this pic the whole body of Fluttershy or just her head?
<DashingRainbow> My MC skin would be Rainbow Dash. But I don't have MC. >.<
<Meanwhile> I bet that hair effect would make great tendons.
<Dark_Horst> i once lost controll of my life. i was drunk like fuck, took the train home somewhat halfway sober at 8 am the next morning, missed my stop 3 times and slept on a train station bank. and appearently someone had puked onto my fabulous hair.
<unfoundbug> dat autotune
<jffry890> dont have minecraft O.o
<Dark_Horst> i now know what a hobo feels like
<jffry890> BLASHPHEMY
<Dark_Horst> NOT good
<Zappy> *headbangs*
<DashingRainbow> Guys, should I get MC? Is it worth the money?
<unfoundbug> pleeease tell me what song this is
<Meanwhile> Hobo's don't feel good. Who'da thought.

<Zappy> Wrek: doing good. Keep up the good work!
<DashingRainbow> Wrek, can you draw Pinkamena sometime?

<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<DashingRainbow> Favorite BigBangTheory char is Sheldon <3

<Meanwhile> DashingRainbow: when the spy dominates a scout he has a chance of saying "May I borrow your earpiece, this is scout, rainbows make cry! over."
<DashingRainbow> Ohh.

*CupcakeWarrior looks at Brenda Crichlow's imdb
<CountDoofus> Dashing: it's something the Spy says in a manner of a taunt. "May I borrow your earpiece? *changes voice* This is Scout! Rainbows make me cry! Over!"
<Meanwhile> Brony4Life: until the scientists finish that portal to Equestria and you see Fluttershy for real.

<Saturn> 08,01everyone nerdy, look at this: https://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.next.announce/browse_thread/thread/6af5808c84a771fc/042c02b1b5992dd3?pli=1
<Brony4Life> i cried my eyes out at My Little Dashie
<Dark_Horst> i mean THINK about it! the amount of energy in a universe is one of THE fundamental facts that make it hold together said univers. if you enter equestria, you take energy with you and raise equestria's amount. YOU COULD MAKE IT EXPLODE!
<Saturn> 08,01it's a piece of computing history
<Capn_fisty> OH MY Brian Cox's voice is so good
<Meanwhile> It's a block of text that means nothing to me.
<Tovler> I'm told Derpy represents Studio B's goodwill towards bronies.
<Sumica> 00,10that's above my paygrade Saturn
<Jaegerpony> goodwill heh
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: that sounds pretty cool
<Capn_fisty> Saturn, anyone apply for B.U.C.K
<Jaegerpony> as in legal goodwill
<Brony4Life> hey guess what
<Jaegerpony> YAY

<Jaegerpony> but not a real green dress: that's cruel
<Tovler> Bah, this whole wanting to be in Equestria keeps reminding me of this one song I love.
<Saturn> 08,01but, to be honest, they're not that great
<Saturn> 08,01well, actually, one of them is pretty good
<AllisZero> Saturn, all my fanboyism
<Jaegerpony> heh
<Meanwhile> If I had a million dollars I probably wouldn't be talking to you lot. I don't really want a million dollars.
<Sumica> 00,10I used to drive a K car.
<unfoundbug> Saturn, I hope you manage to get some reliable people to help
<lemur> If i had a million dollars i would take a bath in it and get a bunch of paper cuts in obscene places
<Capn_fisty> i would apply but i am nowhere near manchester and you really wouldnt want me organising anything
<Saturn> 08,01oh yeah, so if you're a UK brony, you'd better see this: bronyuk.org
<Jaegerpony> A million isn't enough
<Jaegerpony> Or Irish Brony - it's not far

<Pegasister16> CupcakeWarrior: I am, too, but I LOVE MST3K!
<The_4th_Wall> ^
<Randomnerd> So he makes robot buddies for himself, and they make fun of them.
<CountDoofus> I'm 27, and never heard of MST3K either. in my defense, I'm not American (dammit)
<Brony4Life> finnaly the white spot is gone that was making me go haywire

<VioletVanilla> 06o:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We should have bought a Rifftrax of Epic Movie and shown that after the original was WMC'd.
<Sumica> 00,10is it Topgear(snes)
<Jaegerpony> oh no
<CupcakeWarrior> Twilight is best movie *trollface*

<RAWRity> Seriously, this love story is one of the dumbest things I've ever read.

<CountDoofus> d'aww, bird <3
<flutter_spin> too much Spike vision :P
<flutter_spin> I will admit the hair is very nice.
<Tovler> Sounds way smarter than Twilight.
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Tovler> so they went from Death Note to Bakuman.
<Sumica> 00,10can it be TF timez now?
<RAWRity> Tovler: you know, as shitty as Twilight is, it at least had SOME grounding in some semblance of reality.
<Wrek> 05at 4am?

<CountDoofus> 4AM... not for me then :p
<Dashie_Dashie> YES AT 4am.
<RAWRity> Tovler: I personally think Bakuman's better than Death Note.
<The_4th_Wall> Derpy pic
<DaringDude> i like the sound of that bass
<Sumica> 00,10exactly wrek
<Dashie_Dashie> Song sounds epic.
<Sumica> 00,10I played it at 4 am =p
<Dashie_Dashie> and whadoyaknow
<unfoundbug> someone micspam this onto the server
<Dashie_Dashie> it is epic
<mario_pony> Tovler: i thought you were talking about twilight sparkle
<Dashie_Dashie> Sumica, then you made pudding because you lost control of your life?
<CupcakeWarrior> micspam?
<Tovler> That's like going from Full Metal Alchemist to a manga about learning how to farm in college.
<Capn_fisty> why would you need to mic spam it, just leave stream on
<Capn_fisty> dat metal cover
<unfoundbug> so everyone can hear the awesome
<RAWRity> Tovler: eh, not really. Bakuman's very mundane in it's setting, but the characters are a lot more enjoyable.
<flutter_spin> dat Myke - So Many Wonders is awesome
<mario_pony> Wrek: do you have that song from epic cupcake time?
<Tovler> Or going from Elfen Lied to a manga a women's skiing long jump.
<CountDoofus> you know those "... For Dummies" books... does one exist for drawing?
*LadyCanary plops in.
<CountDoofus> (gotta start somewhere)
<LadyCanary> And Im sure there is CountDoofus.
<RAWRity> Tovler: taht'd be a big improvement, since Elfen Lied kinda blows whale chunks.
<unfoundbug> no tf2 Sumica?
<Brony4Life> Brohoof /)(\

*CupcakeWarrior is terrified
<Randomnerd> Gotta go, be back soon
<Brony4Life> :D
<Tovler> Or going from Naruto to manga about baseball. I do remember reading Bakuman, and it wasn't for me.

<CupcakeWarrior> dat derpinkie
<RAWRity> Tovler: I disagree. I feel that gore and the like are done "right" when it's used to enhance the atmosphere of the story (see: Berserk). With Elfen Lied it was more that they just want blood and tits on the page in order to tittilate the viewer.

<Brony4Life> best one = Rainbow Dash
<RAWRity> While Bakuman deffinitely has it's flaws (See: Iwase's entire character, Mashiro and Azuki's romance) I feel that it's better than Death note in 2 respects. 1, there's a more diverse and likeable cast, where as Death Note basically just had L and Light carrying the story while the rest of the cast was rather useless. 2, the motivation of the characters is more relateable and endearing.

<Dashie_Dashie> and then heavy died of diabeetus
<unfoundbug> :O
<RoflBot> ya fun mod
<RAWRity> Death Note had the rather ambiguous moral premise of trying to fix the world through death and deciet. Bakuman's more about the struggle of the artistic process while trying to maintain mainstream success.
<flutter_spin> lol Luna face
<CountDoofus> did my Fluttershy just swear?
<RoflBot> rofl
<LadyCanary> Yus.
<The_4th_Wall> YES
<RaveBrony> I must go play Skyrim now, cya :D

<The_4th_Wall> Pinkie swear?
<flutter_spin> so much ponage
<Wrek> 05next project, fluttershy with that hat n those glasses
<RAWRity> Death Note was original, yes, but it had the issue of only having 2 interesting characters, 1 of which dies half-way through the series. This means there's very little keeping the plot going save a long succesion of twists. Bakuman, while being less original in its cast, fleshes them out allows them to bounce off eachother and act as foils to one another.
<RAWRity> emangamer: Pinkie Quest
<flutter_spin> Yes please Wrek
*The_4th_Wall is SOOOOOO BORKED
<emangamer> RAWRity: you and your text walls

<RaveBrony> Im going through some practice rounds on TF2 :P

<Aldag71> hey guys my friend made a fan fic
<otakon> hell no
<Aldag71> want the link?
<otakon> Over a Barrel was GREAT
<CupcakeWarrior> Over a Barrel had a good song though
<Brony4Life> RD is so cute especially when she sleeps on the cloud
<CCCP> I really liked read it and weep
<stallion1> fanfics are good
<Aldag71> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/12429/Revenge
<flutter_spin> You guys want my episode ratings?
<Brony4Life> do a barrel roll
<otakon> flutter_spin: sure
<RAWRity> episode ratings?
<CCCP> flutter_spin: yes plz
<Brony4Life> how do we chage the person whos streaming
<otakon> um
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01[22:50:37]	otakon	also, does anyone think "Mysterious Mare-do-well was the weakest ep in Friendship is Magic so far? <- It was the weakest of S2.
<CriticKitten> Uh
<RAWRity> Brony4Life: the streamers decide that.
<otakon> we need a techie
<CCCP> Brony4Life: u are now streaming!
<Brony4Life> really?
<CCCP> no
<flutter_spin> I didn't update it but its for 41 episodes
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well I meant the WHOLE series so far really
<kirzstryfe> 1,3you have to pull their cartridge out of the slot, blow it out a few times, and put a new one in the slot
<CriticKitten> If Mare-Do-Well had been part of Season 1, I doubt it'd get even half of the flak it gets right now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I dunno compared to the whole season.
<CCCP> ^
<CriticKitten> So judging from that alone, no, it's not the worst
<CriticKitten> At all.
<MahBoi777> Brony4Life: it will change if you.....BELIIIIIEEEEEEEVE
<CupcakeWarrior> What kind of software would I need to make my own stream?
<flutter_spin> 1(15)	02 (28)	The Return of Harmony Part 2
<Brony4Life> lol
<kirzstryfe> 1,3at least 5 internets
<CCCP> Daring Do needs to make a comeback
<flutter_spin> well hangon
<CupcakeWarrior> Derpy needs a side series
<DaringDude> CCCP: so true
<otakon> hmm maybe
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I feel bad for the writer that her first episode was mediocre, but she improved with Hearth's Warming Eve.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: maybe. maybe not. But I honestly have to say that it's on of the few episodes that I didn't find myself enjoying.
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: I'm ready when you are...
<otakon> yh
<mario_pony> mexican soap operas are violent
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord: what was her first ep again?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No-one's even offered to restream me.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I feel sorry for the shit she got, saying she was ruining the series.
<flutter_spin> I'm just going to type it out heh. There are a lot of additional info
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The Mysterious Mare-do-well.
<Brony4Life> hey streamers pls pick another streamer
<CriticKitten> Nittany: I think it's more that Mare-Do-Well took place after several solid eps.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3haven't seen you ask either Nittany :p
<MahBoi777> streamers for a party
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't ask here.
<CCCP> oh it wasn't that bad really people over react to much
<flutter_spin> 1: Return of Harmony Part 2 2: Return of Harmony Part 1 3: Dragonshy 4: Bridle Gossip
<Brony4Life> trixe wont stop staring at me
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord but...but...but... I got my other computer up and running
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No offense, but I'm not getting much attention today in some places.
<flutter_spin> 5: Friendship is Magic Part 1 6: Friendship is Magic Part 2 7: Secret of My Excess 8: Lesson Zero
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I didn't say it wasn't weak. Only that it's not nearly as bad as it's proclaimed to be. It's probably mediocre and would've been a middle-of-the-road ep for S1.
<Tovler> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rpes8HekUw HA, I love discovering old anime songs.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: what's wrong man?
*kirzstryfe glomps Nittany_Discord <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I was/am worrying myself to death.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Over finances.
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany needs more wub
<flutter_spin> 9: A Dog and Pony Show 10: The Last Roundup 11: The Best Night Ever 12: Boast Busters
<otakon> well don't
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They always get me down.
<mario_pony> but i thought you wanted winning
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not making money and I'm nearly broke, so it's got me down.
<CriticKitten> But since it arrived during S2 when expectations were higher, combined with the fact that it preceded several other strong eps, that has led to people making it out to be way worse than it was
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well keep looking
<mario_pony> *whining
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have time for work.
<emangamer> man, if we dont play portal I'mma be pissed

<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well you have to MAKE time
<Tovler> Cutie Pox, Owl's Well, and Mare do Well at the bottom 3 for me.
<MahBoi777> this was a triumph
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you can't do school if your utterly broke

<Brony4Life> im making a note here
<flutter_spin> 18: Sweet and Elite 19: Party of One 20: Sonic Rainboom
<Brony4Life> huge success
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But when I have to use it all doing my thesis, what am I going to do.
<MahBoi777> it's hard to overstate my satisfaction
<CriticKitten> Honestly, I was less fond of the Rarity eps than of MDW....
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you have to make time damn it!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's another problem.
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: theseus*

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have time to work enough to pay my bills.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well you need to borrow money then and get your thesis done ASAP
<CCCP> i converted my dog to a brony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's my plan.
<CupcakeWarrior> This chat got depressing
<Tovler> It's not the beard on the outside that counts, it's the beard on the inside.
<Sumica> 00,10use connect in the console
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: it is not
<MahBoi777> I'M HAPPY
<CCCP> Im so depressed i hate life and everything in it
<CriticKitten> Nittany: If it's a school loan you need....get private loans through a bank. The interest rate will be lower than federal loans.
<CupcakeWarrior> good job CCCP
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU&ob=av3e
<flutter_spin> Yeah, so when they had the marathon I voted my episodes.
<mario_pony> ^ makes me happy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't think a bank will give me a loan w/o a job with this economy.
<CriticKitten> My federal student loans have almost twice the interest rate. >.<
<Tovler> I'm even more depressed. I need to stop paying attention to politics
<otakon> I learned an important lesson today from Ballad of the Brony: GRIFFINS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<unfoundbug> everyone join red
<CriticKitten> Pft
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would only need $1400 for the month.
<CCCP> every thing is hoorible and boring, Happines is just a distraction from life and life.... life sucks
<mario_pony> this is what i worry about
<CriticKitten> If they would give me countless thousands to pursue my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, you should be able to pull off a small loan.
<mario_pony> what will happen to me when i grow up
<Sumica> 00,10be warned i ahve never tested it like this so it could lag to hell and back.
<Brony4Life> WE NEED A STREAMER THIS INSTANT OR THIS CHAT WILL BE TORN APART
<CriticKitten> Even without a job. It'd help if your mom will offer to co-sign, too.
<Tovler> Having a ton of children is the best distraction from life.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wishes WSI would pay me for doing my thesis.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3calm down Brony4Life
<otakon> it will not Brony4Life calm down
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's based on their work.
<DeadpoolDash> rawr
<flutter_spin> For some reason I really didn't like Over a Barrel. It seemed like things got worse and worse. The setting wasn't in Ponyville and that Applejack's cousin annoyed me to death
<Brony4Life> ok
<MahBoi777> why sir, this chat has never been happier and healthier *looks at the depressed faces* see?
<flutter_spin> For me, it was out of place.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The person who wrote the paper I'm basing my research on was paid for doing pretty much the same thing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then paid again.
<mario_pony> don't worry be happy it will soon pass
<CCCP> IVE NEVER SEEN OVER A BARRLE
<stallion1> should we vote on what to see?
<Tao-mell> hey there, everypony
<MahBoi777> hi Tao-mell
<Tao-mell> what's streaming at the moment?
<Brony4Life> do a barrelroll
<CriticKitten> What the hell. Why is it that weathermen can be CONSISTENTLY wrong and still keep their jobs?
<MahBoi777> nuthin
<CCCP> hi Tao-mell
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Over a Barrel is meh, but Pinkie carries the episode well.
<flutter_spin> The owl episode dragged for a long time. I don't think anything "happened" in that episode
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I liked it
<Krakass> Nittany_Discord, student loans?
<CriticKitten> "Small chance of a mix of rain and snow today." I look outside, it's clearly snowing.
<Brony4Life> ima brohoof /)(\
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CriticKitten: *handwave* Computer models.
<CCCP> not even ponies are making me happy any more.
<Tovler> (ugh, this song always gets to me)
<emangamer> ugh...no portal I guess :'(
<flutter_spin> One thing bugged me about Swarm of the Century. Pinkie KNEW about the parasprites, but no one seemed to ask her what to do. It urked me the entire episode
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nope. Sorry.
<MahBoi777> portulz
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy everypony.
<otakon> flutter_spin: yet, Twitchy Tail gets them listening though
<mario_pony> CCCP: your making me depressed :(
<kirzstryfe> 1,3*irked
<CriticKitten> Nittany: I can predict the weather better than they do with their computer models. It's winter, so, I PREDICT THAT IT'LL BE COLD WITH A CHANCE OF SNOW. GEE WHAT A SHOCK.
<otakon> hiya Everlasting_Joy
<stallion1> its all in how you look at things
<MahBoi777> ohai Everlasting_Joy!
<CCCP> mario_pony: sorry
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Persistence forecasting.
<Tovler> flutter_spin: yeah, the episodes that revolve around simple mistunderstandings always bug me.
<flutter_spin> yeah. I mistype when I'm tired.
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777 This salutation is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy otakon.
<stallion1> you have a choice
<CriticKitten> How can they seriously keep getting on air every day and report something that's so wrong that you can tell they're wrong by LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's nowcasting.
*Brony4Life looks out window
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Try forecasting tomorrow.
<Brony4Life> oooh nyan cat
<otakon> CriticKitten: bc it's a PREDICTION and it's not 100% accurate EVER
<CriticKitten> They don't get tomorrow right, either
<CriticKitten> Or the next day
<flutter_spin> Show Stoppers was... an embarrasment? I don't know. I guess I wanted them to get cutie marks or something. Just reminded me of the bad memories when I was a kid.
<Tovler> Its cold during winter. Proof that Global Warming is a european socialist kenyan lie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01100% chance of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sooo for those wandering Sumica server ip is 71.53.161.58:27015 use console to connect~
<CriticKitten> otakon: Then why bother with 14-day forecasts?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0114-days is a crap-shoot.
<CCCP> We can all agree tht the return of harmony was amazing?
<CriticKitten> If you can't get it accurate within 24 hours, why bother trying to predict 14 full days?
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-sCrhRPCMg
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP yes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are measures of accuracy (skill).
<Sumica> 00,10cant seem to get scrncap to see fml now.
<Tovler> ooh. Thunder and Lightning tomorrow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're pretty damn accurate for 24 hours.
<CriticKitten> Not around here. ._.
<flutter_spin> Feeling Pinkie Keen would have gone up in rating IF she used her abilities in other episodes. To have her suddenly get these predictions killed the episode. Then to only see them in the Mare Do Well episode.
<CriticKitten> The guy I listen to on the radio has been wrong virtually every single day.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just because operational meteorologists are wrong some of the time don't mean they're wrong all of the time.
<CCCP> this is me all the time http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/121/f/9/depressed_pinkie_pie_by_atomicgreymon-d3f9pv4.png
<CriticKitten> He also said we'd get 5-7 inches tonight.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially when 3 models are telling them 3 different things.
*CriticKitten looks outside. There's not even one inch.
<Tovler> I loved Feeling Pinkie Keen's moral.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Where do you live CriticKitten?

<CCCP> mario_pony: i am a cranky doodle donky
<RaveBrony> How are you scootaloo???
<CuddlyKittens11> hmm, I'd actually say that the first two episodes in the series were the worst.
<MahBoi777> flutter_spin: I liek them all, lol
<CriticKitten> Probably not.
<RaveBrony> Theres so much about TF2 that i need to learn :'(
<CCCP> only Pinkie pie can cheer me up
<otakon> damn, mfw I'm only halfthrough Ballad of the Brony
<CuddlyKittens11> When I'm showing my friends the series, I actually start with the sonic rainbom one
<CriticKitten> If we are, then someone screwed up XD
<mario_pony> CCCP: hmmm maybe some cute kittens or babies or both will make you happy
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon, consider that fact that it's basically where all the news goes, it has become the center of the MLP:FiM fannon universe.
<otakon> indeed
<flutter_spin> I think MLP took maybe 6 episodes to get going with the older audience
<CCCP> mario_pony: rather have ponies
<otakon> I wonder when it will get to 200 Million
<Tovler> MLP was supposedly an instant hit, according to Know Your Meme
<mario_pony> CCCP: some filly ponies?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Check your local NWS office's website.
<Everlasting_Joy> Mentlegen.
<CCCP> mario_pony: mabey
<CriticKitten> Really? I thought the first two episodes were quite strong actually
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.nws.noaa.gov/largemap.php
<MahBoi777> I didn't "hate"MLP FiM right off the bat when I first heard about it
<CCCP> CriticKitten: agreed
<otakon> CriticKitten: well for intros it's fairly standard but good
<CupcakeWarrior> I thought bronies were gay when I heard about it

<DaringDude> went to work there
*Tovler wants to embrace gay bronies.
<CCCP> its starting to make me happy

<RaveBrony> I never thot bronies were gay O.o
<otakon> eeyup
<MahBoi777> first time I ever saw like a little clip of the show, it was from a random YTP, lol

<RaveBrony> How i became a brony?

<CupcakeWarrior> I just knew it was a toy
<Tovler> I think 25% of bronies are gay. … nah I just made that up
<CCCP> ohhh i cant hold it back
<DaringDude> ?^
<Everlasting_Joy> I love reading/watching the haters too!
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy: i LOVE and Tolerate haters
<otakon> indeed
<Dashie_Dashie> Streams good Sumica
<DaringDude> ^
<flutter_spin> Who knows how it really happened. I remember seeing the Skyrim mods, maybe the Learn Your Meme video, then it just happened. I do recall seeing Season 2 Episode 4 live.
<CupcakeWarrior> Haters: Y U SO SILLY?
<otakon> love and tolerate
<Everlasting_Joy> CCCP I especially love the ones who have never seen the show before.
<CriticKitten> It does everything your first two episodes should do. Introduces the characters with a fair amount of time spent filling them in, introduces a terrible threat to confront and a magical macguffin to defeat it with, and even does a decent job with the "stereotypical" stuff it does, like "the power was inside us all along".
<CCCP> Everlasting_Joy: i agree
<RaveBrony> Intesive Pony Unit -> Bronies are Fags -> Reaction to: Bronies are Fag -> Don't have bronies as friends: episode 1 -> Episode 1
<CupcakeWarrior> I just watched an episode of mlp just to see how gay it was
<stallion1> I'll be back
<RaveBrony> Became a brony :D
<CupcakeWarrior> Next thing you know, I am brony
<RaveBrony> ^^
<CCCP> CupcakeWarrior: dont be homophobic
<mario_pony> CCCP: http://newsimg.ngfiles.com/250000/250929_131483158391.jpg
<flutter_spin> Yeah, I watched one episode at a time and finished them all in a week
<Tovler> I watched it because CR implied that he liked it.
<MahBoi777> CupcakeWarrior: LOL, watchin an episode of something you hate? that makes sense
<DaringDude> the night i watched my first episode i ended up watching all of season 1
<RaveBrony> I used to be soooo homophobic O__o
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm not going to type my story out here.
<flutter_spin> Then I learned it was Laura Faust.
<CriticKitten> I pretty much marathon'd the show once I got through the first two.
<RaveBrony> Then my best friend came out of the closet -_-
<CupcakeWarrior> Laura Faust? whos that?
<CriticKitten> To get through all of season one.
<MahBoi777> lol
<DaringDude> Ravebrony: me too kinda weird
<flutter_spin> I'm like "OH MY WORD ITS POWERPUFF GAL"
<CCCP> mario_pony: YAY!!!! I dont care! about being sad shes soooooo cute :3 :D YAY YAY THANK YOU <3 <3 <3 YAAAA! i <3 life yaayayay
<Tovler> I could never truely be homophobic. I just can't hold fake grudges like that.
<RaveBrony> Hey, PPG was the Shit back when i was younger!
<LadyCanary> ^
<Tovler> I mean, I wasn't
<MahBoi777> wow, dat mood chang, lol

<otakon> oh LordCelestia canaries are YELLOW
<CCCP> OH what a wonderful place

<LadyCanary> But I said it for a reason
<mario_pony> i have to stop looking at cute pictures of ponies
<otakon> mario_pony: you will never stop
<flutter_spin> I thought "yes, I love this episode" and then "why don't we see more?"
<CriticKitten> LadyCanary: yfw I read that last part of your comment to Saxy in the voice of Date Masamune

<mario_pony> LadyCanary: no
<MahBoi777> once upon a tiem, I made a sandwich THE END
<mario_pony> flutter_spin: nope
<RaveBrony> o.o
<flutter_spin> My brother and I were going to play Star Trek Online, but had to come up with some names for our ship
<flutter_spin> When we met, we had the best ships in the universe
<unfoundbug> oh come on
<unfoundbug> 3v1
<flutter_spin> His ship was the U.S.S. Bacon and mine was the U.S.S. Donut
<CriticKitten> LadyCanary: Actually, Date's Engrish is so hilarious because I totally picture Pinkie Pie playing Date.
<CriticKitten> "HAVE A PARTY!"
<Everlasting_Joy> flutter_spin Ha! I love those names.
<LadyCanary> ...
<LadyCanary> Somebody. Draw that.
<RaveBrony> ^
<LadyCanary> Pinkie Masamune.
<CriticKitten> It's been done.
<MahBoi777> LOL S.S.Donut and S.SBacon are great names
*CriticKitten digs up link
<CupcakeWarrior> Who the hay is Date?
<mario_pony> flutter_spin: is that it?
<CriticKitten> tinyurl.com/AREYOUREADYGUYS
<Tovler> Nobody goes on a Date like Date
<flutter_spin> Well, there is more -- but it isn't interesting past that
<LadyCanary> CriticKitten...IZ SO BEAUTIFUL
<CriticKitten> Well, it needs the http:// bit but yeah
<RaveBrony> Omg!!! My ponies arent walking around my screen!! *opens desktop ponies*
<LadyCanary> OMG Sanada Yukimura Twilight Sparkle.
<CriticKitten> Inorite!
<mario_pony> i have a story
*MahBoi777 sits down for story
<CriticKitten> I wish I had animation skill, I would've already tried it.
<mario_pony> this one time at band camp....
<LadyCanary> And Oyakata samaaaaa will be Celestia, CriticKitten.
<CupcakeWarrior> Did I just see Scootaloo?
<flutter_spin> My whole life is a story. I could go on for awhile talking about it.
<Everlasting_Joy> Those mods. . .
<mario_pony> i got a flute and....
<CupcakeWarrior> OH GOD
<mario_pony> lol jk
<RaveBrony> How....how do you become a pony in TF2 o.o is there a place when i can read up Everything i need to know about this stuff??
<CriticKitten> "I, Twilight Sparkle, shall do my best to defend all of Ponyville with these spears of mine, Celestia-sama!" "TWILIGHT SPARKLE!" "CELESTIA-SAMA!" "TWILIGHT SPARKLE!" "CELESTIA-SAMA!"
<flutter_spin> I had a programming class in college. "Advanced Programming"
<flutter_spin> It was the worse class ever. I actually failed the class.
<CupcakeWarrior> CriticKitten: What anime are you talking about?
<flutter_spin> Well ok, so about 3/4 of the class failed it.
<mario_pony> and iiiiii willl always looove yooouuuu!!!!!
<flutter_spin> Our instructor was Mr. Mellon. We called him mellonhead
<RaveBrony> Oh dang O_o
<RaveBrony> Doesnt sound like a fun class...
<MahBoi777> mod using mods
<RaveBrony> ^
<CriticKitten> Sengoku Basara. It's pretty much what you get if you take all the awesome in every anime ever and distill it down into its manliest form.
<flutter_spin> He refused to give out 100s, because "no one is perfect"
<LadyCanary> CupcakeWarrior: Sengoku Basara. Originally it was a game called Dynasty Warriors.
<flutter_spin> Highest grade you could get was a 99
<September> Well guys, its been fun. See ya all later.
<CupcakeWarrior> CriticKitten: Does it have an english dub?
<LadyCanary> The character designs were very different than the ones in the anime.
<MahBoi777> wake me up when September ends
<RaveBrony> Bye September!
*emangamer is back
<MahBoi777> bye September
<LadyCanary> It does, CupcakeWarrior.
<Everlasting_Joy> Farewell September.
<LadyCanary> And it's pretty darn good.
<CupcakeWarrior> Sweet
<CriticKitten> CupcakeWarrior: Yes, but trust me, you want to watch the Japanese subs.
<mario_pony> 2 i 2 son 4 4 i 2 son 6
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy emangamer.
<CriticKitten> It's SO much funnier
<RaveBrony> Little High! Little Low!
<CupcakeWarrior> CriticKitten: I never watch subs silly
<flutter_spin> Actually if you did everything he told you in an assignment, you would get a 75. If he liked what else you did in addition, you worked your way to a 99
<CriticKitten> The show isn't the same without Date Masamune's Engrish
<MahBoi777> Little Hey Little Ho
<LadyCanary> Anyway the wiiiind bloooooows
<RaveBrony> omg
<flutter_spin> The min passing grade of that assignment was a 75
<flutter_spin> class*
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777 (\
<Tovler> All this talk of Basura reminds me that I need to watch Brave 10.
<LadyCanary> True, CriticKitten. Still, both are good. Oichi is my favorite <3
<CriticKitten> Aye
<RaveBrony> Youre awesome for knowing that :D
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony:/)
<MahBoi777> LOL
<mario_pony> quien aqui abla espanol?
<CriticKitten> And I love Oichi! She's my fav character from Basara 3.
<LadyCanary> My ex and I actually wanted to go as Nagamasa and Oichi but THAT wont happen xD
<flutter_spin> He would give us code that would "benefit us". The problem was that the code didn't work.
<MahBoi777> I loved that movie
<flutter_spin> We would come back and tell him "hey, this code that is supposed to do what you told us doesn't work"
<flutter_spin> He would come back (and troll) "Yeah, did you figure it out? I told you I would lead you down the rosey path"
<CriticKitten> Though I also liked Nobunaga and Ieyasu in Basara 3, they had fun play styles.
<CriticKitten> The former wields a sword in one hand and a shotgun in the other. How can you not have fun with that? >_>
<flutter_spin> He would come into class, say "be right back" and run down some coffee. He'd be gone for 20min into class time
<mario_pony> power up the bass cannon
<mario_pony> fire
<flutter_spin> It was one of the reasons why I never did graduate from college, even though I went 5 years
<LadyCanary> CriticKitten: I havent played any of the Dynasty Warriors game, though I've heard such great things about it. Ive seen my ex play Sengoku Basara for the PS2.
<flutter_spin> Dynasty Warriors 3 & 4. 5 is cutting it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Timed out.
<Tovler> ;-; I just had a nostalgiagasm
<unfoundbug> connection dropout
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> crash ?
<Sumica> 00,10Gonna lower number of bots
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have DW 4.
<Krakass> Kinda, looks like it fixed itself
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*6
<CupcakeWarrior> Whoa!
<Sumica> 00,10but also crashed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Server crashed?
<CriticKitten> Sengoku Basara is basically a derivative of Dynasty Warriors that "anime'd it up"
<flutter_spin> DW3 was all about pre-designed awesome weapons you could get. It made you overpowered.
<LadyCanary> With an EPIC THEME SONG.
<CupcakeWarrior> Dynasty Warriors is a silly game
<LadyCanary> abingdon boys school <3
<Sumica> 00,10gonna have to learn how to set a real server instead of just finding out you can join my bot match.
<flutter_spin> DW4 was very well balanced and less cartoony. You could also customize your epic weapons.
<CriticKitten> It made the fights much more flashy, the humor more absurd, etc
<mario_pony> Power up the bass cannon...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I was doing well too.
<mario_pony> FIRE!!
<otakon> CriticKitten: eeyup, it's fairly good too
<CriticKitten> And it really does it so well
<flutter_spin> I never did get DW5/DW6. I was moving during that time.
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: OH, so you'll play with him, but not me?
<emangamer> I see how it is
<CriticKitten> We definitely have to convince somepony to stream the anime some day.
<emangamer> :'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would play if I could stream.
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: I know, I'm beign a silly filly ,3
<emangamer> <3*
<otakon> CriticKitten: try NewDCD ofc, he's all for hotbloodedness
*Nittany_Discord 11,01tickles emangamer
<emangamer> heheheheheehe stop it...
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh noes
<Sumica> 00,10ok server should be coming up now.
<RaveBrony> :D
<CriticKitten> otakon: Probably a good idea
<otakon> indeed
<CriticKitten> It's definitely up his alley too
<MahBoi777> LOL
<flutter_spin> DW2 was horrible. 3&4 were good. I think 5&6 had crazy interaction fights
<emangamer> do any of you mods have Dark Cloud 1/2? I would love to see that streamed
<CriticKitten> Oh hey, more Pinkie Date.
<DeadpoolDash> did we all get kicked?
<Sumica> 00,10if this works out ok I will learn how to run other maps

<emangamer|mtg> otakon: man...some of those prices have skyrockted...a pack of arabian knights costs...what 75 maybe?
<OneTrickPony> before I leave for a bit, SuperPonybeat came out with a new track

<Krakass> Link works for me?
<otakon> sorry

<flutter_spin> I have to play cheap. $2 for blind bag RD figure will have to do
<otakon> odd it didn't work the first time opening
<YourLittleDashie> Thanks <MahBoi777>
<emangamer> Tovler: nope... 6/8ths time is where it's at
<Phase4> so... no stream

<YourLittleDashie> Phase4: Thanks
<YourLittleDashie> and now... TIME FOR RANDOMNESS
*RainbowJack wave at everypony
<Phase4> you would not belive what is on tv here
<MahBoi777> I liek randomness
*emangamer waves at Rainbow-Dash
<Phase4> ohai RainbowJack
<emangamer> RainbowJack: *
<YourLittleDashie> :'(:S:(;):D:|6_9
<MahBoi777> hey RainbowJack
<otakon> emangamer: what video?
<RainbowJack> hello
<OneTrickPony> hai thar RainbowJack
<YourLittleDashie> Hello RainbowJack
<emangamer> otakon: derpy reaction video
<otakon> emangamer: I didn't do it to describe you, I linked it bc IT WAS FUNNEH!
<emangamer> otakon: you know my feelings about that scene
<RainbowJack> whats up Bronystate
<YourLittleDashie> Phase4: What's on TV?
<Phase4> http://youtu.be/vnwKFg1F-vI
<emangamer> sup RainbowJack
<OneTrickPony> there are too many people with rainbow or dash in there name I get so confused
*Phase4 was just finding a link
<MahBoi777> RainbowJack: I'M FURIOUS
<Phase4> theres an octocat in it
<flutter_spin> It is crazy because I didn't know about the Derpy fandom until AFTER the episode
<otakon> emangamer: besides, it said the AVERAGE brony reaction. You not enjoying one iota of Derpy in that scene is DEFINITELY not average.
<YourLittleDashie> Phase4: WAT
<Phase4> ikr
<emangamer> otakon: but STATISTICALLY it should describe me
<emangamer> and it didnt
<emangamer> so I blame you
<flutter_spin> After I saw the reaction post, I learned everything about Derpy
<RainbowJack> what ya mean MahBoi777?
<otakon> emangamer: statistics and average are related but not the same
<YourLittleDashie> I just don't know what went wrong!
<MahBoi777> I be angry
<emangamer> otakon: but it still STASTICALLY should describe me...you cant say it doesnt add up that way
<flutter_spin> I didn't have a reaction, sadly. I just sort of smiled like after hearing Junebug talk
<RainbowJack> YourLittleDash thats Derpy's line
<YourLittleDashie> I NEED SOME ENTERTAINMENT
<YourLittleDashie> RainbowJack: I know LOL
*MahBoi777 juggles chainsaws
<otakon> emangamer: seriously, you are one of the few that didn't enjoy a DIRECT SHOUTOUT TO THE BRONY FANDOM FROM THE CREATORS FOR THE LULZ!!!!
<YourLittleDashie> MahBoi777: OMG be careful!
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obdLhRTfDFo There: Watch the lava lamp.
<emangamer> otakon: I didnt say I didnt enjoy it, I just found it forced and am afriad of the consequences of that scene
<emangamer> flutter_spin: I do love that video
*MahBoi777 accidentally drops one
<MahBoi777> LOOK OUT
<emangamer> MahBoi777: was it a bass?
<YourLittleDashie> flutter_spin: THIS IS 20% MORE ENTERTAINING: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqrd8R-b5SQ&feature=related
<MahBoi777> emangmer: whuzzat?
<otakon> emangamer: HOW was it forced? it was completely unexpected and EVEN SET UP THE SCENE to encourage AJ to win the 1st Prize for the money to repair the Town Hall.
<emangamer> YourLittleDashie: that was....weird
<flutter_spin> 20% MORE ENTERTAINING: http://megabronyupload.deviantart.com/gallery/34941800#/d4pbrw5
<emangamer> otakon: everything PAST the roof was forced
<MahBoi777> emangamer: whuzzat?
<YourLittleDashie> *chainsaw flies towards me* AHHHH TELL DADDY i LOVE HIM!!
<DeathStar> you want entertainment i'll give you entertainment http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhiJwfj0URs
<YourLittleDashie> emangamer: LOLX
<emangamer> MahBoi777: I found the derpy scene forced and was a afraid of the implications
<otakon> emangamer: like wat? like AJ being ashamed of not winning the prize money and not wanting to admit it to her friends? I NEED AN EXAMPLE here
<Phase4> oh god what am i watching
<Phase4> that spliced show is still on
<YourLittleDashie> DeathStar: OMG I LOVE THIS SONG I SANG IT IN HISTORY CLASS IN 6TH GRADE!
<MahBoi777> emangamer: ohhh, lol
<emangamer> otakon: I mean breaking the ground or just fucking up RD... that was too much and made her out to be a walking diaster that everyone SHOULD hate
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SXpwah0KKo : Favorite Animanaics Scene. I still sing it today.
<emangamer> flutter_spin: that is a good one
<MahBoi777> DeathStar taught me about time zones, lol
<DeathStar> :)
<MahBoi777> and now I know
<otakon> emangamer: and yet OTHER characters with those VERY SAME traits are loved and treated as classic icons. The lovable klutz isn't a bad thing, Derpy at this point is like homage to Goofy I'd say.
<emangamer> otakon: I fucking hate goofy... and they OVER did it with derpy...
<Sumica> 00,10Thanks for the help with UAC seems I had turned it off but the system had more updates that were precenting things from being done
<YourLittleDashie> I found some entertainment by opening this video in 10 tabs at once: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRGbrs83wRA
<Phase4> ohai Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
<otakon> emangamer: they DIDN'T overdo it. have you SEEN the crap Pinkie pulls on a regular basis? how about RD's unbelievable resistance to injury hmmm?
<MahBoi777> YourLittleDashie: Mother of God......lol
<emangamer> otakon: read it and weep...HA read it and weep (see what I ddid there?)
<YourLittleDashie> Sorry I left on accident 9_6
<flutter_spin> lalalaaaaalalalalalaaaaa :P I love that vid
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<MahBoi777> it's so catchy and easy to remember
<otakon> emangamer: like I said, RESISTANCE. not IMMUNITY, and no one was friggin yelling "THEY WENT TOO FAR!!! RD CAN'T GET HURT THAT BAD!!!!!
<YourLittleDashie> CUPCAKES
<YourLittleDashie> Sweet Apple Massacre
<MahBoi777> no YourLittleDashie
<YourLittleDashie> Friendship is Tragic
<MahBoi777> don't mention those plz
<flutter_spin> What conversation did I lose out on?
<emangamer> otakon: umm...I have no bucking clue what your saying
<emangamer> otakon: besides, pinkie is ACTUALLY funny
<otakon> emangamer: humour is subjective
<YourLittleDashie> Fine... My Little Dashie
<YourLittleDashie> Pink Memories
<YourLittleDashie> The Wild Blue Yonder
<emangamer> otakon: no, what I say is funny, IS funny
<YourLittleDashie> OH WAIT
<otakon> emangamer: I am SURE there is a fan out there that just thinks Pinkie is not funny AT ALL.
<emangamer> otakon: not possible
<otakon> emangamer: once again, humour is subjective
<emangamer> otakon: nope...
<otakon> emangamer: oh yes
<emangamer> my humor is ALL humor
<emangamer> :3
<otakon> hmmm, no kick?
<flutter_spin> I thought Derpy was a random pony trying to do something right, but perhaps takes awhile to figure it out. The deep voice was a derp from the VA, which ... adds to the derp of the eyes which.... I guess build character?
<Phase4> derp derp
<emangamer> flutter_spin: nah...not really
<otakon> flutter_spin: well, Tabitha was trying for her neighbor's son, she didn't realize Derpy was a girl
<YourLittleDashie> I'm bsck
<YourLittleDashie> *back
<otakon> emangamer: besides at this point it was just another shout out. Look at the Big Lebowski ponies in "Cutie Pox"
<Phase4> holy god theres a twilight parody on abc 3
<emangamer> otakon: I dont see the connection
<Phase4> xD
<YourLittleDashie> Phase4: WAT
<flutter_spin> I usually stand neutral. If Derpy does these things, it is something that Derpy does. I actually found it admiring that Rainbow Dash was doing her best to help out someone who obviously needed it
<Phase4> a show called 'you're skitting me'
<MahBoi777> good, they need to make fun of Twilight
<otakon> emangamer: that was a reference ONLY OLDER VIEWERS OF THE SHOW WOULD GET. DERPY IS A LITTLE ADD IN FOR THE OLDER VIEWERS OF THE SHOW.
<YourLittleDashie> Phase4: LOL
<emangamer> otakon: I still dont see your point
<emangamer> otakon: we'll have to discuss this over skype one day
<YourLittleDashie> I'm so boreddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
<YourLittleDashie> :[
*MahBoi777 hands YourLittleDashie a paddleball:D
<flutter_spin> A horrible reference to the older audience is when Fluttershy blushed at the beginning of Cider episode. Majority of people didn't get it. I didn't get it. Only in chat were "oh she's naked, hahaha"
<otakon> emangamer: no, nvm, your just being too thickheaded to see wat I'm getting at. you hate derpy, everyone else loved it, end of story I am done.
<Phase4> YourLittleDashie: http://youtu.be/_hnYKFQSsGA?t=26s
<YourLittleDashie> MahBoi777: YAYZ
<Phase4> i cant belive this is real

<otakon> what the HELL happened to common sense?
<otakon> WHY!?
*Tovler is bothered as shit on this new War Against Women
<String_Shredder> at least their not going after boys scouts
<Pegasus> YAY I'M A IDIOT!
<Dashie_Dashie|Ponies> that died with the 90's otakon
<Jim> Radical Girl scouts`-.-
<Jim> Sounds legit
<otakon> String_Shredder: oh no, ofc not.
<Kammerjunk> Also, "All the rest are feminists, lesbians, or Communists"
<otakon> inb4 they go after the boy scouts
<Kammerjunk> Guys, we don't like X, let's call it communism!
<Tovler> The Boy Scouts are proudly anti-gay so they're all good.
<Pegasus> That's good
<otakon> String_Shredder: they are ATTACKING The Lorax film, Arriety from Studio Ghibli AND The Muppets, saying ALL of them are pushing liberal "agenda's"
<RaveBrony> What are you all talking about?
<otakon> RaveBrony: FOX News being an insufferable prick
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Kammerjunk> ...
<Kammerjunk> A center for RECOVERING GIRL SCOUTS?
<RaveBrony> Lol, what else is new? :D
<Kammerjunk> WHAT.
<String_Shredder> us americans are SO stupid
<xcanox> Indeed.
<Jim> Even worse, he wrote, only three of the 50 role models promoted by the Girl Scouts have even "a briefly-mentioned religious background." What's wrong with not being religious?
<otakon> String_Shredder: not all of us
<Tovler> The fact that we can't set out rivers on fire anymore means that something is wrong with America
<String_Shredder> most of us
<xcanox> String_Shredder: Being American doesn't make you stupid, it makes you ignorant.
<Jim> There should be a first quotation mark there
<otakon> Jim: to the right wing, if your not religious your EVIL
*Pegasus flys on a rainbow with dash
<RaveBrony> Pretty soon FOX News is going to turn on itself :D
<Kammerjunk> xcanox: [citation needed]
<otakon> xcanox: I might be ignorant on a few things true, but I have THE INTERNET
<Phase4> the newest threat to our freedom: girl scouts
<otakon> bloody damn right wing idiots
<Tovler> Politics just isn't fun anymore. I can't even watch The Daily Show
<otakon> hmm?
<Phase4> politics was fun?
<Pegasus> that show rocks
*Jim doesn't care for politics at all
<Kammerjunk> Well, politics DOES mean "blood sucking parasites", so it's fair game.
<otakon> it still hasn't ruined The Daily Show and The Colbert Report for me yet
<String_Shredder> bill o'reily is just a bunch of yelling and disagreeing
<otakon> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.341903-Watch-The-Muppets-Skewer-Fox-News
<xcanox> Kammerjunk: <@Sane> being american doesn't make you stupid, it makes you ignorant
*Pegasus thinks politics suck
<otakon> yh guys watch that clip
<String_Shredder> colbert is still best
<Tovler> well, it was fascinating for me at first.
<otakon> it WILL bring a smile to your face
<Kammerjunk> String_Shredder: It's your own fault for listening to O'Reily.
<xcanox> Kammerjunk: <~Underdose> we're arrogant, you're ignorant
<xcanox> Kammerjunk: <~Underdose> get it right <3
<Kammerjunk> xcanox: That's not even a generalisation, it's a stereotype at best.
<String_Shredder> FuCK IT, WE'LL DO IT LIVE
<otakon> xcanox: where are you from? besides, Kammerjunk doesn't live in the US I don't think
<Kammerjunk> I'm a Dane.

<Kammerjunk> Tovler: Maybe it's our retarded leaders or our failing economy.
<Tovler> note to self: buy girls scout cookies.
<Pegasus> /me I love NOT NEVER EVER NOT watching politics
<Tovler> It's not our leader's faults. It's… The Girl Scouts, and Teachers, and The Lorax. That's what's destroying america
<RaveBrony> lol!!
<GrimGallop> o.o

<Kammerjunk> At least you're not discussing how to stem the flow of immigrants with retarded plans.
<Ragnalock> How you ponies doing?
<ofna01> good
<Kammerjunk> Tired, as usual. But I can't complain otherwise.
<Phase4> Derpy_at_work: you meen obama?
<Kammerjunk> Well, I technically can, and I am, but I shouldn't
<Tovler> Yep, it's socially acceptable to hate your president now.
<RaveBrony> :\
<xcanox> It was always socially acceptable.
<GrimGallop> Not really.
<Tovler> No, it wasn't.
<ofna01> this one asswipe thinks bronys should be kiled
<ofna01> 'Bronys' should be executed, no trial if you are above 16 years of age, are male and fanatic about a show of cartoon ponies you should be put in the electric﻿ chair and killed for being such a tragic waste of flesh. Queer scum.TheKingeboue27 12 hours ago
<ofna01> ......
<xcanox> lol You do realize he's joking right?
<xcanox> It's trolololololo.
<ofna01> no its not...
<xcanox> I say similar things about emos all the time. XD
<ofna01> parasprite
<GrimGallop> The president gets where he is by a majority vote. There's no reason people should be able to justify hating someone that the majority placed at the top.
<RaveBrony> I like windigo better :P
<RaveBrony> Feed from our anger and hatred, lol :D
<ofna01> http://linkitch.deviantart.com/art/Cotton-Candy-Tail-Wallpaper-220004326
<Tovler> Yeah, but "the people were dupe. They didn't really vote for him. Us Republicans are the true will of America."
<xcanox> ofna01: 'Emos' should be executed, no trial if you are above 16 years of age, are male and fanatic about a show of self-harming you should be put in the electric﻿ chair and killed for being such a tragic waste of flesh. Queer scum.
<GrimGallop> Lol
<xcanox> ofna01: See what I did thar? :P
<ofna01> icwutudidthar
<xcanox> lol Ragequit.
<xcanox> Parasprite successful I guess? xD
<Phase4> if anyone has to say "are the true will of America" you know their argument sucks
<xcanox> Phase4: I've literally never heard that before.
<Phase4> cybin: hai
<Phase4> xcanox: i was quoting Tovler 's quote
<otakon> xcanox: woah, dude that's harsh man.
<Phase4> quoteception if you will
<xcanox> Phase4: It doesn't change the fact that I've literally never heard it before.
<RaveBrony> :D
<Phase4> neither have i
<xcanox> The I Like Trains song isn't long enough. =(
<ofna01> come on everypony,smile smile smile,fill up my heart with sunshin sunshin
<otakon> sunshin?
<Tovler> (is it gonna rain or not? I kinda want to go for a walk.)
<Phase4> politics is booring in aus, even the sessions are booring sessions where each side calls the other a poo poo head
<Phase4> herp derp type
<Tovler> again, it didn't used to be like that.
<GrimGallop> Republicans will have you believe that republicans are the will of America. Democrats will have you believe that democrats are the will of America. I really don't care either way~
<xcanox> You know what I think is the will of America?
*xcanox puts sunglasses on and leans back in chair
<xcanox> ANARCHY!
<ofna01> EVERYONE PUT ON SMILE AND SING ALONG
<GrimGallop> Funny. That's my brother's screen name...
<Tovler> Democrats don't really say that.
<ofna01> come on everypony smile smile smile,fill my heart up with sunshine,sunshine
<GrimGallop> Anyway, the will of America is clearly voiced by their votes, and anyone who says otherwise needs to have their ego knocked down a peg.
<Tovler> I wish I could ponify that mushrooms and roses song.
<ofna01> ENOUGH POLITICS
<ofna01> MOAR PONIES
<Iwubponiez> ^
<Tovler> "The golden door of our emotions opens here
<Tovler> We're all virgins to the joys of loving without fear"
<RaveBrony> O.o
<ofna01> wat tovler?
<xcanox> I'd rather be a square peg in a round hole.
<RaveBrony> :o
*Tovler loves songs that tell a vague love story.
*RaveBrony wants an example of what youre talking about ;P
<RaveBrony> *:P
<Tovler> Early each morning he searched for her
<Tovler> Til his feet become bloody and tired
<Tovler> Her hologram photo stayed near to him
<Tovler> Buried deep in the pits of his heart
<Tovler> The lock of gray hair that she gave to him
<Tovler> Stayed clutched in his fist through the night
<Tovler> Dead or alive, she still yearned for him
<Iwubponiez> i will go now maybe i will be back later
<Iwubponiez> I GO
<RaveBrony> Bye Iwubponiez! Have fun!

<Tovler> Looking at the lyrics, I guess it is in Italian
<nick> Oh yeah, that's italian
<nick> I can ALMOST understand it.
<nick> It sounds to be about "church"
<ofna01> hm
<ofna01> completley different translation for me
<Tovler> So, D'angelo means… the angel?
<ofna01> D'angel face in the mirror,Capelli d'angelo, D'angelo prisonIn the mirror scene of violenceThe tremble without his embraceBarbed wire in the mirror velvetHis trembling like VestaA precious silence for the massesBlindness, the hope becomes ashesPass, breathing easilyThe show his thoughts on peace
<nick> Not exactly
<Onyxiaz> o jeez
<ofna01> thats what i got off translate
<Tovler> ew, that's dark

<Ingwaz> hey prince-dari, i see we're doing a fund raiser for a former mod, what exactly happened to said mod?
<Globetrotter> But my talent is science
<ofna01> some people asked me what episode that was from
<otakon> ofna01: no really, your stuff LOOKS JUST LIKE THE SHOW, it's really good.
<ofna01> and when i told them i drew it,they were so suprised
<otakon> ofna01: also, I am already watching you on DA, are you ever going to continue that one comic story you started?
<ofna01> not sure
<prince-dari> I should probably ask if that's something I'm allowed to say Ingwaz, but no one's online to ask right now.
<nick> I just made my mom a brony.... I don't even.

<RaveBrony> Pshh, my parents shun the show... :D
