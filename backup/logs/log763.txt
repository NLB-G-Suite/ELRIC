<twilight_sprinkle> lel no boobs for hoodi
<Unnr> Princess Tutu is best magical girl
<Sumica> 00,10sudden end
<taoumi> man there are some dark ass animes going on right now
<Ryunosuke> question
<taoumi> no
<twilight_sprinkle> answer
<AlienWarhead> go ahead
<Kandarihu> rebuttal
<twilight_sprinkle> adjective
<twilight_sprinkle> pronoun
<twilight_sprinkle> where mah gerunds at
<Ryunosuke> in the time that it takes them to actually transform... couldnt said monster have attacked and possibly ended the fight there? :)
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: you left them in the cafeteria again, you should be more careful
<taoumi> i was at the store today and there was a wine w/ the brand name adverb
<Starflash> Rule of fun, Ryunosuke.
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: i hope someone doesnt try to eat them again..
<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: the monster was too busy staring at underage boobs
<AlienWarhead> Ryunosuke: that is the million dollar question for every magical girl anime
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: Well you know, like ya do.
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, transforming is a free action. It took a minute for the viewer's benefit, but in the canon timespace, it was about a second
<Kandarihu> I think that's the way it works for most magical girl warrior series.
<HoodyNinja> Yay anime logic
<Ryunosuke> this one, and most others, have to chant something for it to actually happen, what about then? :)
<Sumica> 00,10unless it's digivolving
<twilight_sprinkle> so the ferret thing is the cute menchi fanservicy thing eh
<Sumica> 00,10that takes real time
<SkunkTari> hello everypony

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wonder JP will make version of MLP like PPGZ? :D that would be neat
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: fraid not
<HoodyNinja> He's a Deamon
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, she only had to do it once. After that, all she has to say is "Raising Heart, ONEGAI!"
<Gunthler> you streamin, mica?
<Sumica> 00,10aye
<Ryunosuke> ah
<HoodyNinja> si
<Kandarihu> Sketch_Toku_Brony, I fear that they would INSIST on humanizing the ponies.
<HoodyNinja> Remember kids, this is Japan. So if you have any questions, keep them to yourselves
<Sumica> 00,10what's wrong with humanised ponies?
<HoodyNinja> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> eh, humanized ponies dont work for me personally, doesnt have the same dawish effect, plus humans suk
<Sumica> 00,10all the propirty damage
<Kandarihu> Sumica, as in they wouldn't be ponies. They'd just be humans.
<Buytoast> so?
<Buytoast> you hate humans or something?

*CupcakeWarrior never cries from anything involving fiction
<Ponies47> Sumica, I didn't ask her for one. But you have a point. I don't play video games that much either so basically there was really no point in buying it at all XD
<MadSurge> aniderp: :)
<naturesfury> Polydunami: ever watch air?
<Polydunami> I mean, I was close, but never actually cried

<naturesfury> MadSurge: no way :O
<SkunkTari> this animes is pretty interesting :D

<CupcakeWarrior> why would she choose the name arf?
<aniderp> with jewel like on her forehead
<Polydunami> Arf is busty, but Fate has stockings :3
<CupcakeWarrior> thats the dumbest thing you could possibly name a dog
<MadSurge> She shouldn't be Arf, but Stupid Dog :D
<naturesfury> its a english sound effix
<naturesfury> for dogs
<naturesfury> its what japan dose
<Polydunami> Onomatopoeia.
<aniderp> my dog's name was bingo
<Sumica> 00,10so you are saying blend the two together Polydunami?
<Polydunami> I wasn't quite going that route... but if it works, go right ahead
<aniderp> probly a lame name for a dog but me and my brother were young and he named him..
<CupcakeWarrior> ooh, naked loli
<CupcakeWarrior> :P
<aniderp> brother is older than me btw

<Sumica> 00,10Rule of cool
*MadSurge moves in and kills the magical girl while she twirls around
<Polydunami> Anyway, big breasts kind of clash with longstockings for me, so :S
<Sumica> 00,10also budget saveing
<Sumica> 00,10if you say so Polydunami
<CupcakeWarrior> Polydunami: small chests are best

<Polydunami> How old are these girls supposed to be?
<naturesfury> 10ish
<Sumica> 00,10and then Nanoha learned Love and tolorate

<Jmo> Snow~ :3
<alexxm> not much Cypresswolf but how you doing
<MadSurge> XAX: indeed :) I still wanna send him some coffee and a postcard too :D maybe some booze as well
<valoreins|Drawing> ohai Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> Alright - being lazy today - watching news feeds on people fighting over crap at the stores
<MadSurge> Nothing much Cypresswolf :D
<XAX> MadSurge: lel
<valoreins|Drawing> Cypresswolf: that's not much, my news feed is full of people fighting over Israel-Palestine war stuff
<valoreins|Drawing> and its annoying
<Cypresswolf> I dont see the point in black friday - people buying stuff they already have to "save money" they could save better by not buying anything
<Jmo> Lel you americans and your special holidays
<APS> yo guys mind i ask u question ?
<Jmo> Nop
<valoreins|Drawing> pon
<Cypresswolf> and its always electronic stuff, nothing important - now if they slashed the prices for food at the grocery store for a change, I'd stock up my freezer with all kinds of meat
<valoreins|Drawing> even bacon?
<Cypresswolf> Even Bacon
<valoreins|Drawing> :3
<Gold_Demona> I like Black Friday. I buy lots of video games then. :>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Yay, vidyas! :$
<Gold_Demona> It's also a good time to buy christmas presents
<Jmo> I know ze perfect christmas present for you Dema :>
<Cypresswolf> I was planning on going out tomorrow to see if I can finish The Hobbit figure collection....might wait another 2 weeks, the stores will still be crowded tomorrow
<APS> wen eps air they are livestreamed here at 2 or 230 am my time. this sunday ( my timezone) is the last ep ill be able to watch for a 4 weeks, now heres the question, should i actually get up for 1hr to see livestream which is probs 480 p or w8 till that arvo to watch in 1080p?
<APS> ^ mah question
<Jmo> I stopped reading after wen.
<APS> Lollzzzz
<valoreins|Drawing> i dunno lol
<Gold_Demona> I do both, so I couldn't tell ya. :D
<valoreins|Drawing> i prefer watching here with my lovely bronystate family <3
<Snow|doingstuff> o u Jmo
<Jmo> o u Snow.
<Snow|doingstuff> no u Jmo
<APS> time to pick the old fashion way, eeee knee miney mo
<Jmo> no me Snow
<Jmo> :>
<Phase4> the thing about black friday is stores could totaly lie about the price and savings, and make huge margins off of the percived reduction
<Phase4> but if silly people want to run around trampling people to buy things, thats their buisness
<Phase4> i'll be at home doing stuff
<Jmo> An Australian commenting on Black Friday.
<Jmo> AHAHAHAHAHA WAT.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: this time I don't even know the synopsis of the episode, I can't wait to see what it's about :D
<Phase4> Jmo, we have the boxing day sales, but thats the closest thing i can think of
<Jmo> Yeah well that's Boxing Day :P
<Jmo> This is Americans we're on about.
<Jmo> AMERICANS!
<Gold_Demona> I don't actually go out on Black Friday. That'd be suicide. I shop on the internet.
<valoreins|Drawing> murica?
<Kandarihu> Phase4, it's not common for stores to lie about the normal prices on Black Friday.
<Gold_Demona> The deals on Black Friday are REALLY good
<Gold_Demona> Things really are WAY cheaper than they normally are
<Jmo> Americans shall be used as rollers in the Katamari Wars.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> Yeah pretty much
<Gold_Demona> Roll around giant balls of shopping
<Phase4> Kandarihu, from what i'm seeing that seems true
<Phase4> but still
<Cypresswolf> Gold_Demona: likewise - besides, there's nothing special in the store today, that people couldnt have gotten yesterday
<Kandarihu> Jmo, we're not all like that.
<Jmo> I know Kandarihu :P
<Jmo> I'm only joking around. I know there are skinny americans
<Gold_Demona> Cypresswolf: But yesterday it wasn't on sale
<Snow|doingstuff> im back, internet died
<Jmo> Welcome back Snow :>
<Snow|doingstuff> or at least chrome
<Cypresswolf> I wonder I Toys R Us has those hobbit figures online....
<Gold_Demona> Possible
<APS> only in america would u find a day which results in really cheap prices on stuff, the day after the population give thanks for wut that have
<Jmo> ermagerd Hobbit movie next month
<Jmo> Eeeeeeeeee
<Gold_Demona> APS Eeyup
<Kandarihu> Aaand we're not all willing to kill each other over deals. That's just a small HIGHLY visible minority of psychopaths who make the rest look bad.
<Cypresswolf> rather buy them in store, avoid the shipping costs
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Ermagerd Herbbert merver nerxt mernth?
<Jmo> Yush
<Jmo> I love how it is being showed on my birthday ;_;
<APS> speaking of movies
<APS> anyone seen Paranormal Activity 4?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so how was Thanksgiving? :)
<Jmo> Milked series.
<Jmo> Should of ended at 3.
<Kandarihu> I hope there's better security in stores for that sort of behavior. When I was at Wal-Mart last night, there were security trucks in the parking lot but I didn't see a lot of security in the store.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It was delicious. My stomache was quite full by the end of the evening. :>
<APS> Jmo: that is my first and last Paranormal activity ill watch
<aniderp> maybe i get a mlp fim calendar for chirstmas!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I mostly hung out with my husband's cousins and watched Doctor Who. :D
<Jmo> Lawl
<aniderp> last year i got one :>
<Jmo> Nice aniderp
<alexxm> bye guys
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D did you visit his parents?
<Jmo> Which series Gold_Demona?

<Gold_Demona> Jmo: The new one. Season 7.
<Jmo> Egh. The disappointment series >.>
<Cypresswolf> :3 I might go see a movie now - dont expect anyone to be at the theatre
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, my mom's Colombian and doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving, so we go to his parents' house every year. :>
<Jmo> I shall drown Moffat when he comes to Austarlia.
<Jmo> Australia*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: a big hug and regards is what your mom needs :)
<Cypresswolf> YES! Red Dawn at 10:40 :)
<Gold_Demona> Nah, not really. She just doesn't care. :D
<Cypresswolf> Im hungry again - went out to eat buffet style at Houston Aqaurium yesterday - so much food ^_^
<Cypresswolf> I think those desserts had lembas bits in them >_>
<Cypresswolf> there was this chocolate mousse coconut cake ^_^ sugar comatose ready to happen

<Java> It's only 120 hp
<Java> But it's a good car.
<MadSurge> Perfect for a race then >_>

<Barb|Lappy> And then my other favorite walks in.
<Barb|Lappy> HAI SATURN!!
<Saturn> 08,01i was telling my friends in a lab about my heroin story
<Jmo> Gulp.
<Kandarihu> Well Obama's stalling for time because his policies don't work in practice. Gabe Newell is just taking his time so that his game will be good.

<Saturn> 08,01right as one of my module coordinators was standing behind me
<CCCP> Hi urinal
<Copy> hey who wants to watch PPG movie with me after this?
<Star_Gazer> Saturn: oh shit
<BronyDarth> People at school calls me insane, someone said that Ponies and horses arent the same, its like saying A and I isn't letters.
<d3rb|partypartyparty> Saturn...whoops
<Saturn> 08,01who i'd just a meeting with
<urinal> hey CCP
<Saturn> 08,01and she'd mentioned about my late coursework
<BronyDarth> I gotta go :/
<cowvarkian> Saturn: fun
<Saturn> 08,01so now i think she thinks that all my late coursework is because i'm a junkie
<urinal> cya bronehdarth
<d3rb|partypartyparty> Lol..worst timing
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm not quite sure how to approach her and say that she heard what she heard out of context
<CCCP> Saturn lol that's horrible
<Saturn> 08,01because i'm trying to appeal lateness grading based on my diagnosis of ADHD
<Saturn> 08,01nota bene: i'm still wearing a suit
<urinal> ;o
<cowvarkian> Saturn: >.>
<cowvarkian> Saturn: didn't you say that you were actually going to try heroin thoug
<d3rb|partypartyparty> Maybe just say it how it exactly is saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: i was thinking about it, but i've decided not to
<cowvarkian> ok
<Saturn> 08,01too risky
<cowvarkian> that's probably for the better
<cowvarkian> nobody wants a strung out gas giant
<d3rb|partypartyparty> I see what you dd there
<Jmo> Wait, why would you even think of using heroin?
<CCCP> Hi person that just joined
<d3rb|partypartyparty> Cause it must have felt good jaymoo
<gayniggers> heroin is bad. and hi again lol
<Jmo> That is a serious question d3rb.
<Jmo> When you consider using drugs you really better have a decent excuse.
<CCCP> Why doesn't some one start to cook meth?
<d3rb|partypartyparty> Thats a serrious answer, people dont get into drugs because they feel crap to use
<cowvarkian> Jmo: because last night he was in a train station bathroom next to someone who was smoking heroin
<Jmo> I didn't ask you either d3rb, I was asking Saturn.
<Star_Gazer> CCCP: it isnt easy to cook meth, sure it is basic chemistry, but the process is very fucking dangerous
<CCCP> We need Walter White
<d3rb|partypartyparty> Sorry jmo, im putting my nose where it shouldnt be
<Jmo> It's fine d3rb.
<gayniggers> CCCP: walter from fringe?
<Jmo> You aren't in the wrong, you just added your opinion.
<cowvarkian> walter from breaking bad
<d3rb|partypartyparty> I have a bad habit of buting in out of turn lol
<CCCP> gayniggers: no from breaking bad
<Star_Gazer> one fuck up in making meth and take it away demoman "KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM"
<gayniggers> aok. :p
<Star_Gazer> Saturn: so have you tried snorting heroin yet?
<d3rb|partypartyparty> :o

<Star_Gazer> animaniacs and batman TAS are the two best animated series of all time
<cowvarkian> thats a funny way to spell Gargoyles
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/68aac7ab505d5d7b09033e312a7c4892.png AJ, you got a problem D:
<Star_Gazer> cowvarkian: die in a fire
<cowvarkian> Star_Gazer: I probably will
<Zamer> Batman TAS was good but it's not one of the best
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: AJ, get some help. :D
<Star_Gazer> Zamer: die
<Jmo> Oi
<Star_Gazer> Batman TAS is the best animated show ever
<Zamer> Freakazoid Pinkie in the Brain, Biker Mice from Mars, TMNT
<Jmo> Quit hating on people cause they don't have the same opinion to you.
<cowvarkian> Star_Gazer: I agree with those, but gargoyles is one of the best

<Zamer> had laptop at max volume
<Dark92Enigma> and now, i'm trying to call my mom, and tell her that she was WRONG as usual
<aniderp> i have earbuds in
<Barb|Lappy> That was perfect timing. I was just starting a video that was showing something about Guitar Hero Wrek
<Barb|Lappy> I was confused
<AJIsAwesome> Zamer: That would've HURT.

<thevoidspawnpony> meep
<Barb|Lappy> o_o.... 0_0
<Barb|Lappy> Can't wait
<thevoidspawnpony> ¬_¬
<Barb|Lappy> The last one was soooo good
<thevoidspawnpony> what????
<Barb|Lappy> The last mlp fim episode?
<VenHur> Wait...new pony episode? TOMORROW?! http://www.iruntheinternet.com/lulzdump/images/gifs/kenan-and-kel-aw-here-it-goes-awh-here-goes-intro-kel-1352766252e.gif
<thevoidspawnpony> oh!
<thevoidspawnpony> It looks good, but nothing beats the premiere
<thevoidspawnpony> sombra was amazing, truly my favourite villain
<JunkerKun> thevoidspawnpony: mhmhmrrrrrhhhh... slave... brgh
<MadSurge> thevoidspawnpony: not my favorite, but I wanna see where they go with him :)
<thevoidspawnpony> his horn was okay he could come back
<VenHur> Sombra was a bland villain that does nothing but taking over the Crystal Empire...
<Dark92Enigma> MLP_Brovakiin: alexxm I've finally found the cookies..........Damn you mom, you've hidden them where the devil lost his wings
<VenHur> No backstory, no nothing.
<thevoidspawnpony> Chrysalis had none either
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dark92Enigma: Yay! :D
<alexxm> huh Dark92Enigma i don't get that referance
<HavokOC> I dunno, should it be like this wrek? http://gyazo.com/7a988c80c74ffa5e829763409a62bde6
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: they do explain SOME things about him, but not enough backstory
<thevoidspawnpony> Too many pinkies reminded me of calvin and hobbes
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: it's a famous saying in my country
<Voldemorts-nose> back
<alexxm> ah ok Dark92Enigma
<Barb|Lappy> ... so hawt http://i.imgur.com/ym5yh.jpg
<wipergone2> hi everypony
<thevoidspawnpony> Too many pinkies reminded me of calvin and hobbes
<Dark92Enigma> thevoidspawnpony: only they weren't imaginative
<thevoidspawnpony> and sombra was just makuta
<Dark92Enigma> imaginary*
<MadSurge> Barb|Lappy: DAT KITTY :D
<thevoidspawnpony> from bionicle
<Dark92Enigma> thevoidspawnpony: only that they weren't IMAGINARY
<Dark92Enigma> ¨*
<Barb|Lappy> She shows her patriotism with her underwear
<wipergone2> hi
<thevoidspawnpony> hello
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, wipergone2. :)
<wipergone2> aj
<wipergone2> :D
<wipergone2> :)
<thevoidspawnpony> :(
<thevoidspawnpony> ^_^
<wipergone2> ;P
<wipergone2> :P
<thevoidspawnpony> ¬_¬
<thevoidspawnpony> XD
<HavokOC> D.D
<alexxm> how are things wipergone2
<thevoidspawnpony> O-O
<HavokOC> OyO
<wipergone2> good
<thevoidspawnpony> hey...
<thevoidspawnpony> i just realised something
<thevoidspawnpony> PONIES
<MadSurge> ^
<wipergone2> wrek
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: for example, we know he's been King of the Crystal Empire, we know that he can disable unicorns with ''herpes'', we know he feeds off the bad feelings, and that he uses that Oesed Mirror-like door to reveal everypony's worst fears.......but then again, just like in ''Quest For Camelot'' it wasn't developed or explained very well
<Dark92Enigma> points if you know where the Oesed Mirror comes from
<Madviking> hey everyone
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: I feel we haven't seen the last of Sombra though
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Madviking. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, MadSurge.
<Madviking> hey aj :)
<MadSurge> Hoy Madviking!
<Ross_Pit_shark_hunte> Oh hai mark
<Pika-Picho> Oh god this song/
<Madviking> hey.....fellow Mad
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: true, he can either come back in the season finale, or the comics
<MadSurge> Madviking: indeed :D
<Madviking> lololol :D
<GarrettBrony> Could you please play some Boston. Something about you. if thats ok with you
<Zamer> only reason why Sombra should win Worst Villian is because he lost to a baby dragon
<Barb|Lappy> (,_') is shure dew luv pwniez http://i.imgur.com/QtCSQ.gif
<Zamer> outside defeat he was good
<AJIsAwesome> And an Alicorn.
<Madviking> Zamer: lolol
<wingboner> i see movement
<AJIsAwesome> And an entire Crystal Empire, as well.
<Pika-Picho> Hell yes
<GarrettBrony> Barb|Lappy Hey I didn't know you wrote fanfics
<Madviking> i think he might be a throught the season villain, you know like an overlaying plot?
<Barb|Lappy> horse x horse
<cowvarkian> horse x horse x otakon
<GarrettBrony> no
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: I see what you mean, like the entire season being one epic saga?
<AJIsAwesome> * Madviking
<HavokOC> I see something moving
<Madviking> exactly like he might manipulate people or something
<wingboner> buffering
<HavokOC> Like
<HavokOC> In the bottom left
<Wrek> 05aaaand back
<HavokOC> (i think)

<cod_is_terrible> lol this game is so glitchy
<Discorded_Lightstar> is this mmo
<SunshineStars> The person playing it seems to be terrible at it :P
<Saturn> 08,01if i was a failure, would you all hate me?
<Discorded_Lightstar> bout i get plane so i get blowed up
<vidmaster4694> no
<Juice> No
<Discorded_Lightstar> great idea
<MLP_Brovakiin> Nah, we still love you Saturn :3
<Discorded_Lightstar> PPFFFFTTT
<MadSurge> Saturn: NO. You're awesome :)
<Madviking> nooope
<SunshineStars> Hey Saturn, i'm also a failure, so why would i go hatin? Love and Tolerate bro
<vidmaster4694> i suck at ps2
<Discorded_Lightstar> Saturn: like if
*Saturn 08,01is in danger of failing his degree because his ADHD got the better of him on a couple of courseworks this semester
<Saturn> 08,01i'm so worried
<Toxicswarm> Where is the episode ?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm in abject terror that i'll fail out
<Vivix> oh, that sucks- I hope it works out
<Discorded_Lightstar> Saturn: ur greated person i know
<Saturn> 08,01i can't sleep because of it
<Vivix> yuo can't do anything extra to make up for it?
<FlyingToaster> What is 'it'?
<FlyingToaster> Gosh darn it, is it the Crystal Empire :P?
<wipergone2> will it get optmized for lower end
<Saturn> 08,01Discorded_Lightstar: thank you <3
<Zamer> Saturn have you tried talking to your teacher to see if you can do any extra credit to help you pass?
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: nope
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Saturn: You'll be fine.
<Saturn> 08,01Zamer: i've e-mailed just now
<wipergone2> saturn
<Vivix> Well, I can do is wish you good luck~~
<FlyingToaster> What is going on :P
<Madviking> dont worry Saturn just put more effort into it and youll be just fine
<wipergone2> will planetside 2 get optimized for lower ends?
<Saturn> 08,01i didn't have the courage to before, because i *hate* getting special dispensation because of my ADHD
<Saturn> 08,01i really hate talking about it to teachers/lecturers/bosses too
<Vivix> My teacher used to tell me to go outside and have a run- yeah
<Discorded_Lightstar> i need 10 dollars so i can get choclate and shove it in Saturn face
<vidmaster4694> I got aspergers and ADHD
<Zamer> what about the possibility of making a A on the final?
<FlyingToaster> Discorded_Lightstar: Here you go
<Discorded_Lightstar> ty
<HavokOC> Saturn is best pony
<Saturn> 08,01i was only diagnosed about 4 years ago when i was 21
*Discorded_Lightstar shove choclate in Saturn face
<FlyingToaster> EAT IT.
<Vivix> I was diagnosed when I was 7 I think
<Saturn> 08,01and i was on medication for a while, but they can't prescribe it in scotland
<Zamer> gotta love that ridilin
<Vivix> Concerta?
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<vidmaster4694> I take concerta
<Saturn> 08,01concerta XL
<Saturn> 08,01the slow release version
<Zamer> i literally refused to take it when i was a kid
<Vivix> Concerta worked for me for a while, but it made me calm and shy, more so-
<Discorded_Lightstar> :|
<Saturn> 08,01today was a terrible day for ADHD for me
<Vivix> so we opted to stop taking it
<HavokOC> I've had ADHD since I was 3 (14 now), I haven't taken any medications. I'm fine
<Saturn> 08,01because i've not slept much
<HavokOC> (i think)
<HavokOC> >.<
<cowvarkian> Saturn: I think I used to take that
<Vivix> HavokOC, yeah, some people don't need the medication, some do~~ it's a huge umbrella term
<TheKoreanBrony1354> LALALALALA im bvack
<Saturn> 08,01i had to fill in a simple ticky box questionairre about my module
<Saturn> 08,01and i couldn't do it because i couldn't read the damn questions
<Saturn> 08,01because i couldn't focus on it
<FlyingToaster> Well. That really sucks.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> this planetside 2
<Saturn> 08,01i'm getting more and more convinced that ADHD is a language processing disorder more than anything
<Discorded_Lightstar> i want to play alien swarm :/
<Saturn> 08,01i'm like tthat with speech too
<cowvarkian> well that would make sense
<Saturn> 08,01i usually just lie and say to people i'm partially deaf
<Saturn> 08,01because it's easier to explain
<Saturn> 08,01but i really have trouble understanding people when they're talking and other noise is going on
<Discorded_Lightstar> need a sniper rifle
<Saturn> 08,01especically with that other noise is speech
<Saturn> 08,01
<Vivix> ADHD is complicated- my diagnosis goes out on concentration, not so much anything else
<Discorded_Lightstar> so i can shoot guys miles away
<Saturn> 08,01the hyperactive part of my ADHD has actually been much less in recent years
<Vivix> yeah, I hate being in cantines or places with tons of people, I can usually concentrate there, but sometimes it just sounds like all the noise comes in one huge wave
<Saturn> 08,01i used to be completely bouncing off the walls at times
<FlyingToaster> Well, that's good.
<Saturn> 08,01literally jumping across couches with boundless energy
<Kawaii_icybeauti> That's good.
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: do you hyperfocus?
<Vivix> It is indeed- doctors used to say ADHD is outgrown, but recent studies say that it does not, but it changes nature as you age
<Madviking> i had a friend like that once when i was 5 his dad literally had to drag him out of my house XD
<Saturn> 08,01the things i hyperfocus on are computers and music; surprise surprise, those are the things i'm best at
<FlyingToaster> Why are the streams almost always about video games?
<SpeccyRush> go home BaconMane you're drunk
<Jmo> Oh boy here we go.
<Vivix> hehe, yeah I think so, but all my symptomes are pretty mild nowadays
<Kawaii_icybeauti> FlyingToaster: -in alien pose- Mods.
<FlyingToaster> Kay
<Saturn> 08,01it's odd, because though i have toruble picking out and understanding individual voices with noises going on, i can separate out orchestral music in my head, really really easily
<Saturn> 08,01any music, really
<Vivix> I haven't had a new diagnosis, so I don't know how much it's changed, but I am calm, but unfocused and stuff
<FlyingToaster> So I guess you get a benefit from that
<BaconMane> 0,5AM NOT!
<FlyingToaster> It's really hard to do music
<SpeccyRush> ARE TOO!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Imaigne, being able to seperate all the insturments from a song....I try to do that all the time, never works.
<AJIsAwesome> Go home, BaconMane. You're sober.
<Vivix> yeah, music and art is probably one of my focuses
<Vivix> I can seperate almost all instruments in most songs, but that'
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Hey guys. Heya Wrek!

*AssaultWithEmbraces huggles AJIsAwesome

<Saturn> 08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: it's the opposite for me; find it really easy to take music apart and interprate it
<pony_1336> New one

<AssaultWithEmbraces> D'aww
<MadSurge> Saturn: I sometimes can't understand right away stuff my mom is saying, yet I can hear fine my cat scratching at the door to get in :D
<Professor> lol
<Vivix> My cat usually scratches the window when he wants in
<Vivix> noone can miss that sound
<MadSurge> Hello AssaultWithEmbraces :)
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hui
<Saturn> 08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: my mutant superpower is being able to hear a song, pick out all the parts, and play them separately or together on a piano
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> hi
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I play by ear whenever I'm in orchestra though, even thoguh I have to plays second violin, I always end up playing the 1st part sicne I can hear it better.
<Professor> my planet side sucks it crashes and the graghics are horrible lol
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: aye, exactly
<Saturn> 08,01i'm like that
<Vivix> I kinda envy you that, Saturn, but I know that would make me insecure in how my songs sounds as a whole
<Madviking> is it me or does the pistol seem more op than the rifle?
<MadSurge> Vivix: I'm in an apartment block at the second floor, it's hard for her to climb that high :D
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Album Compilation - November
<Vivix> MadSurge, hehe, imagine if she did- heartattack
<Vivix> There's this house not far from here, where they made a ramp for their cat to the second floor
<MadSurge> Vivix: superkitty! :D
<thelonepony|BL2> :I
<Saturn> 08,01which is why, is you look at pictures of me during the convention, you see me with my hand cupping my ear a lot, and right up close to people who are talking
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Well guys gonna head off
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bye
<thelonepony|BL2> damn internet :I
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony|BL2: ?

<AJIsAwesome> Oh....
<Vivix> Huh, maybe I have some of that. Was at the mall last night buying a present, and as usual, I can't really hear what my sister was saying
<Saturn> 08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: more like i can hear everything that's said, i just can't understand it. it's like they're speaking a foreing language
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai thelonepony|BL2 :)
<Madviking> you guys talking about borderlands 2? or something else?
<Professor> you guys know any good sandbox games??????????
<Saturn> 08,01*foreign
<thelonepony|BL2> Hi MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Saturn: So it must be like when I hear my parents speak spanish to each other and when I'm in costa rica....I'm blanked out.
<Madviking> o wait im dumb its his name
<MadSurge> No, I'm very good at picking individual voices in a croud (when I wanna hear someone in particular)
<Professor> hi surge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Vivix> One of the forms of ADHD has something that makes it difficult to seperate voices or sounds
<Vivix> or rather, to block things out
<Vivix> so in a crowd it's like you hear everyone at once
<MadSurge> Hi Professor!
<Vivix> I don't have that very strong, but that's one of the things that was described to me
<Professor> damn his graghics are good lol
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's really funny, I'm at my abulita's hosue, and my mom is speaking to everyone, and I'm just sitting there going "WTF"
<Madviking> k guys ima shove off got some grinding to do on halo cya!

<LadyCanary> That's what makes the series so great Floris.
<Infectedflower> Great!

<Infectedflower> look what you did!
<meleeman> what
<pony_4143> Fuck physics
<joker4383> what?
<LadyCanary> There doesnt have to be an obscene amount of dialogue for the series to be great.
<Infectedflower> PICK UP THE PHONE
<Floris> Or, doesn't speak to himself at all in a situation like this.. Most cartoons end up with the main character talking to himself when he is alone.. A lot.

<Infectedflower> Because
<CountDoofus> Haio ponies.

<Floris> :S
<Alchemist> Spade I personally checked ep1 and 2 almost frame by frame, didnt do it for ep3 though, but she wasnt found yet as far as I know.
<weeping_pegasi82> Dovah: because hands are complicated
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Alchemist: Not sure if I should be concerned you did that
<Dovah> I got one hand done... too loke 20 min :|
<Dovah> like*
<Vordox> Alchemist: Season 3 Derpy'?

<kristelsouthpark1> Dovah: What are you drawing?
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School]: it doesnt take that much time
<meleeman> ow
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Derpy was originally a animation goof they left in right?

<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: apparently yes
<kristelsouthpark1> Dovah: never seen it, but heard of it
<Alchemist> Vordox: yes. and confirmed ones, not the ones where you cant see either the cutie mark/wings/eyes.
<Dovah> kristelsouthpark1: I am drawing Erza from that.
<Vordox> Alchemist: She has been seen once with almost 100% chance
<Vordox> Alchemist: But only once
<kristelsouthpark1> Dovah: I'll google to see
<Alchemist> Vrodoxat the jousting scene?
<EnoughAsh2> as i had heard they intentionally made derpy's eyes like that but we werent actually supposed to see her
<meleeman> oh i hate that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why was the Crystal empire gone for 1000 years?
<Swordsman979> no idea
<aniderp> dat pinkie face
<Alchemist> because of reasons
<meleeman> wait

<kristelsouthpark1> Dovah: Oh my gosh, that must be really hard to draw!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Couldent they have just banished Sombra and not the whole damn kingdom?
<kristelsouthpark1> :O
<Dovah> kristelsouthpark1: just a bit

<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: 1000 confirmed to be an arbitrary number
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im not sure...was it speficly said how long ago Discord was sealed away?
<kristelsouthpark1> what did pinkie do?
<Dovah> kristelsouthpark1: also, the picture i assume you saw when you looked up erza, I am NOT drawing that one, at least not yet :P
<meleeman> soo the next day they save the crystal empire they banished her to the oon?
<meleeman> moon?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Was it a century or something?
<MadSurge> meleeman: more like take one year/decade or two
<kristelsouthpark1> Dovah: Oh haha, well if I can't see it. I can always wish you luck
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Was it ever said how long ago Dscord was first sealed away?
<kristelsouthpark1> Dovah: In the netherlands we say: "Succes!" when we mean: "Good luck!
<kristelsouthpark1> "
<Shizuka> 13yes we've already been through the problems with the chronology, crystal empire is banished before nightmare moon, but nightmare moon comes back first, both with a stated time of 1000 years
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *Discord
<Shizuka> 13discord wasn't specified
<MadSurge> ^
<Dovah> kristelsouthpark1: well I will Succeed!!
<meleeman> soo
<Tenderheart> I'm pretty sure 1000 years is just a round about number..
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wouldent have a problem with the 1000 years thing if we had some time line, I mean jesus Celestia had a busy year 1000 years ago
<kristelsouthpark1> Dovah: yay~

<DoctoDoctorWho> I think angel is like pinkie, He has a good and evil side.
<alexxm> how've you been SkunkTari
<SkunkTari> alexxm: i have been alright :3
<KTKomedy2813> PlanetSide 2 needs to be for PS3.
<meleeman> never,but NEVER compare PINKIE with someone!
<KTKomedy2813> Okay, Angel IS impatient at times, but lately, he's been showing a sweeter side.
<Pika-Picho> What about Gilda? She's a dick.
<EpicCoffee> The Great And Powerful Trixie!
<Pika-Picho> Trixie is fine.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Gilda is just a jerk sammich covered in jerk sauce.
<pony_3819> what about discord?
<Bronysith> whats going on in here?
<KTKomedy2813> Discord kicks ass.
<Pika-Picho> Discord isn't rude.
<meleeman> discord is just discord
<Infectedflower> yeah
<EpicCoffee> But Discord's cool. @P3819
<pony_3819> fair enough
<DoctoDoctorWho> At least trixie can show a good side.
<Infectedflower> He is the spirit OF CHOAS
<Pika-Picho> Trixie might be misunderstood.
<Spamish2> I hope that Trixie has a bad past, that would explain everything.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Discord never hurt anypony
<meleeman> lets see that in the new episode
<EpicCoffee> Nightmare Moon ( i guess)
<meleeman> if she have a good side
<meleeman> or something
<KTKomedy2813> Roof douche! Tree douche! Point A douche! Nice douche! Thing douche! ... (pauses) Douche douche!
<Dovah> welp
<EpicCoffee> Princess Trollestia.
<meleeman> oh god
<Pika-Picho> Maybe trixie's friends left her because she was starting to become a show off due to this bully.
<pony_3819> Gummy
<meleeman> she is the real troll
<Bronysith> can we stop with the talk of Season 3 spoilers?
<pony_439> we'll see in the new episode
<KTKomedy2813> DOUCHE ARMY AHOY!
<DoctoDoctorWho> She doesnt need a bad past, her talent is being a large ham and a showpony. She simply got carried away is all.

<Riders> *for
<GrymShip> Not sure.I'll look it up
<KTKomedy2813> Personally, I want to play a game where campaign and online multiplayer come together containing full voice acting and cinematic set pieces mixed with the awesomeness of fucking shit up with your pals and miscellaneous losers you don't know. Who agrees with me?
<Zamer> right now I'm trying to correct the Audio/Video sync
<cachi01|Blackcops2> KTKomedy2813: im not sonic
<cachi01|Blackcops2> im my original character
<cachi01|Blackcops2> blonic

<DoctoDoctorWho> Rose`: are you here?
<Pika-Picho> Nic.
<Zamer> my only two complaints though for Sonic Generations is that it literally requires a controller and the audio/video sync issue
<Zamer> which supposedly there's a fix for
<KTKomedy2813> Discord fucked up a tank in the game.
<cachi01|Blackcops2> werehog = manhog not wolfhog so HA FAIL SEGA
<FlutterMEDIC> Sketch_Toku_Brony: the amount of collectibles is INSANE. the death animations for every class is brutal, and just everything is awesome
<GrymShip> I never had the audio/video sync problem personally.And I use a cheapo controller I bought for lçike 10 bucks
<GrymShip> *like

<FlyingShoppingCart> Hello, my oh so awesome friends! What the game playing right now? :)
<ZeroBlue4> This is one of 1000 reason I don't play shooters... (Don't worry, it's not because I think they're bad, I save that opinion for specific games)...
<ZeroBlue4> 1... I can never see what is going on.
<KTKomedy2813> Nobody gives a fuck? Aw, well, as an early Christmas gift, I am giving you a fuck.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, FlyingShoppingCart. Planetside 2. :)
<ZeroBlue4> 2... My reflexes suck at fine manipulation...
<FlyingShoppingCart> AJisAwesome, thanks! :)
<AJIsAwesome> No problem. Glad to help. :)
<Datpony120> what system is this on? Pc?
<KTKomedy2813> Yes.

<Datpony120> I love Silent Hill and Resident Evil but mostly Silent Hill
