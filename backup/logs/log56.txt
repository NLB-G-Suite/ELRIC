<Applebloom> Ho do yew guys do that whole fanceh thing where you make ma name green?
<Dave_BroZilla> :B
<NewDCD> well, I propose making this one stream as a test
<DSNesmith> oh please
<SilverMane> Reticentsmolder, who are you?
<DSNesmith> Jaws 4 was the best
<vimberttheunimpressive> she drowned, that's why there's all this blood!
<DSNesmith> it had voodoo
<nah> @dragonrage you, reticentsmolder and dave_brozilla.
<Kezarim> Random shipping occuring... or so it seems.
<techdude300> Make sure Flash is up to date
<interior_gummy> jaws 3d starts with jaws killing a fish
<HaveTumorWillTravel> That's only for big ponies, Applebloom
<Axel_Foaley> Shark Week still exist? What else is there to talk about?
<Meanwhile> DSnesmith that aint even funny
<nah> @dragonrage you're all a thing now.
<Elky> ryan, what do you see then?
<mib_apc7aw> Sad Cop is sad
<chillpenguin1> if you watch jaws backwards its about a shark vomiting up people until they have to pen a beach
<thunderhooves> HUMANS ARE TOO SQUISHY FOR TASTEYS
<ReticentSmolder> <---------- photoFINISHIM
<HuffytheMagicDragon> I pranked you guys with the name fight I opened two tabs
<HaveTumorWillTravel> The big ponies who keep everything in order here
<SirSprinkles> 6Isn't that basically what we're doing?
<DSNesmith> Kezarim, you ain't seen random shipping in chat
<RainbowLoon> inb4 projectile vomiting
<SilverMane> nah, you can't ship people until I get shipped.
<NewDCD> I was suggesting we should take the poll at Intermission time or post-Movie Night, though
<WhatPayne> Best A movies are those which could be categorized as B movies too.
<Caulron> Brody makes a final stand. He tosses one of Hooper's scuba tank into the shark’s mouth and climbs onto the ship's mast. He fires his rifle directly at the tank, blowing the shark to smithereens. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody swim safely back to shore.
<maxaminus> Shes chum, dude.
<PaladinDW> HAND!
<Applebloom> But ah wanna quote too >:
<Razyn> It's not random shipping. It's DESTINY
<Nittany_Tiger> Discovery still does Shark Week.
<Axel_Foaley> So music only plays when something Sharky is happening?
<DragonRage> I don't even know those guys, though! For all I know we have no chemis-ooh, crabs.

*Elky just inject caffeine

<xDaFreakshowx> ¬_¬
<DSNesmith> the pace of this chat makes me feel like the movie is slow
<nah> yes we are.
<Dave_BroZilla> Everytime I see that I'm going to Hell
<Luchadeer> Pool's closed do to sharks
<Pottu> Door opens
<killerrabbit> I believe this is appropriate to this discussion
<mib_npb2zz> ok
<Pottu> man comes out
<mib_npb2zz> just checking
<HaveTumorWillTravel> We sure are, anon
<Axel_Foaley> A proper white suburb right there.
<Pottu> old man is annoying
<SilverMane> but Elky, saturday is when the fic happens, Friday is when everyone hits on me and makes me feel pretty. I mean...
<Razyn> ReticentSmolder, you know what speed does right?
<D_man> kezarim, but this isn't saturday show
<Elky> hm, true dat keza
<thunderhooves> why are there drums- oh
<Wolfcat22> Applebloom, cover your ears too
<ShoutingRyan> Maybe it will work in IE tab. I hope I'm wrong.
<nah> god as usual i'm paying more attention to the chat than i am the movie

<Dave_BroZilla> then again, people are waiting on the lottery tomorrow
<NewDCD> Rifftrax = BOAST BUSTIN'?
<Axel_Foaley> Hardly anyone is combining ponies with this.
<xDaFreakshowx> kinkeee
<_L1pE_BR> Well shit, I didnt know about the anti-spam protection
<Sathi> 7neither do I..
<Ghosties> But the point is that this is an A film, and using Rifftrax would take the air out of the "A" part of the film
<RainbowLoon> MY NIPPLES EXPLODE WITH DELIGHT
<Wolfcat22> Boyscouts? I'll be there

<GabeMoist> When does this start tomorrow?
<killerrabbit> hrmm, that command doesn't work in this chan!
<RainbowLoon> Dave_BroZilla: well, we all are mesmerized by SilverMane
<SHammy> Rainbowshy?!
<thunderhooves> no beach closed due to crabs
<Hipster_Brony> 8because it sticks around longer
<SirSprinkles> 6The text is just... better.
<Ghosties> I don't really care either way, but, I prefer text as well
<Drstupid962> I gotta pee but i dont want to miss the movie... Help me D:

<Elky> 2 PM eastern
<xDaFreakshowx> meh
<D_man> SPOILERS: everyone is killed by sea ponies. this is why they didn't get a gen4 reboot
<RainBroDash> as long as it is done efficiently
<NightmareMoon> XD
<LuridChronomancer> Heya, all!
<Dave_BroZilla> Indeed
<GabeMoist> thank you
<Wolfcat22> Hold your wee.
<Kokonoe> PEE YOURSELF
<ReticentSmolder> we need a ponychan thread about how SilverMane brings all the Bronies to his yard and, damn right, its better than yours
<Mongoose> lol
<Dave_BroZilla> makes sense
<thunderhooves> lol
<DesSur> JAWS is about a city that somehow gets its economy solely out of tourism and not through any other factors, such as trade, import, or local businesses, which we can blame on the shark rather than the government's seemingly large incompetence to take notice of their people. WHAT A STORY.
<D_man> hi luridchronomancer
<Elky> hi lurid
<mib_apc7aw> Beached Closed due to G1 Ponies
<Hipster_Brony> 8and we dont have to worry about the stream cutting out and people missing announcements
<ShoutingRyan> Well, IE tab works even less. Doesn't even show the chat. I CAN NOT MAKE THIS CONNECT. I NEED TO KNOW WHY BEFORE IT STARTS.
<Meanwhile> It means shoo-be-doo
<Axel_Foaley> The jellyfish killed all the sea ponies.
<mib_apc7aw> *Beach
<killerrabbit> not since spring derpybot? XD
<NewDCD> *shrug* it just seemed to me that frankly, viewers liked the idea.
<Naiishere> Friendship is Magic style hippocamp-seaponies would make this movie so much better.
<scatr> wait they're taking a car out to sea?
<xDaFreakshowx> well...that's good...I guess.

<Combustiblelemons> oh god g1 ._.
<Tyranico> Hello Luric
<RainBroDash> I don't think polling for something like this is a great idea. we should save polls for things like feature night content imho
<NightmareMoon> Well of course not. Why would I allow my Royal Pet out in public with a saddle?
<xDaFreakshowx> Seeing as it probably IS considered kinky...or something.
<SHammy> What about me?!
<Tyranico> *Lurid

<xDaFreakshowx> haha
<DesSur> Chris Hansen: So where are we swimming towards today, shark?
<SirSprinkles> 6We and some guests.
<Enterprize> the shark is a chain
<Dave_BroZilla> Bigger fish requires bigger fishing hook
<Ghosties> 4That means we're picking the film?
<DesSur> JAWS: I swear, it isn't what it looks like.
<Jenemmy> Agreed wolfcat22
<NewDCD> God my mother is annoying

<Jenemmy> He can just about read
*NightmareMoon wipes Stormwind out quarter by quarter.
<SilverMane> lol
<HaveTumorWillTravel> And teach them fear of sharks at the youngest age possible
<scatr> this is the perfect ruse to catch a shark
<Hipster_Brony> 8not during an actual broadcast
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> they need a bigger pier
<SirSprinkles> 6Why would we do it mid week?
<SilverMane> piece of cake
<Meanwhile> I believe your vessel is of questionable size.
<Elky> wait, they just use a giant hook?
<bassline> Those guys are screwed lol

<D_man> to let mods stand out desu!
<SilverMane> D_man would probably be right
<Bjornfot> maybe i meant inafter
*Razyn wonders how Silvermane can gag when he's top
<DSNesmith> Jaws accidentally the boat
<maxaminus> This is about the point I would just go blow Quinn's brain's out.
