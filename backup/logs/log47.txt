<drfsupercenter> 03so I need to run recovery on that older drive to get the crap back
<Syrup> (how many of you are looking up what that means?)
<Kevin> I found our theme song.

<SilverMane> either of you on Facebook?
<SilverMane> inb4 Cupcakes music video

<Polarfire> I'm not big on facebook.
<SilverMane> it's gotten a decent Brony community lately, even a few groups for us
<RainBroDash> 0yarp, but I don't really mix RBD with real life things. I know some pretty intolerant people. So far everyone I know who knows about the ponies has flipped their shit at me : /
<Polarfire> interesting.
<Polarfire> Me too.
<Polarfire> I don't mix RL and ponies.
<RainBroDash> 0the only place I do is steam
<SilverMane> i only have my RL account on FB, so I keep it under wraps as best I can
<RainBroDash> 0but that's because only my hardcore bros are my friends on steam
<RainBroDash> 0silvermane same
<SilverMane> my family is... mostly clueless so far, although they are starting to wonder why my 'friends' pony bag is still there
<Polarfire> My family is totally clueless.
<RainBroDash> 0i mean, as long as the people I add aren't stupid and don't post ponies on my facebook wall, I don't mind adding bronies on fb
<RainBroDash> 0just saiyan
<SilverMane> nah, typically i've only seen them posted on walls named after the mane cast/background ponies
<RainBroDash> 0my family isn't around much, I practically live home alone xD
<RainBroDash> 0ftw

<RainBroDash> 0oh wait lol
<SilverMane> wiat
<RainBroDash> 0it's 14 lb to the stone, duh oh yeah xD
<RainBroDash> 0we measure in stones and lbs.
<RainBroDash> 0im dumb
<lightumbreon> 06erm
<Polarfire> what? you brits and your units XD
<lightumbreon> 06can anyone here connect to Lugia.us?
<SilverMane> I don't use stones ever, and I got kg and lb backwards apparently
<lightumbreon> 06it says "account suspended"
<SilverMane> i'm more like 63 kg
<RainBroDash> 0 14 pounds in a stone
<Presea> o_O
<SilverMane> so I'm 10 stones. but you know I act like I got 40!
<Presea> i'm on ocean.lugia.us atm
<lightumbreon> 06no
<lightumbreon> 06i mean the site
<Presea> oh
<Presea> hmm
<lightumbreon> 06http://www.lugia.us
<RainBroDash> 0I'm 11 stone, but I recently lost like 16 pounds *hero flex*
<Presea> ..
<Presea> didn't pay the host

<RainBroDash> 0tubby RBD is no more, and RBD is pleased.
<Polarfire> good job RBD
<RainBroDash> 0something like that xD
<Presea> i haven't been on the forums lately..
<Presea> so idk what's up
<RainBroDash> 0I have imba self control at the moment
<lightumbreon> 06me neither
<SilverMane> Pones have given me self control recently over a... ehem, more innappropriate habit of mine... ehem
<RainBroDash> 0the key is a heroic sense of being insanely and overly cocky and self confident, without due reasoning.
<RainBroDash> 0hah silvermane, clopping is perfectly fine to talk about xD
<Polarfire> I'm 6 ft 150 plus or minus 2 or 3 lbs.
<SilverMane> lawl, but it's weird to talk about being down to once every few days, if not once a week
<RainBroDash> 0and at first I thought I'd seen a slight reduction in that when I first started watching teh poni, but then I realised I was lie.
<Polarfire> Silver, I can honestly say I have clopped less since I started ponies.
<Polarfire> Way less.
<RainBroDash> 0i haven't. WOO Exception that proves the rule!
<SilverMane> maybe it's because we have something to do on the internet. so when we get bored, we ALWAYS have something to do
<RainBroDash> 0Well, actually probably less. But I still do it like once a day because I'm bored a lot
<RainBroDash> 0ftw
<Polarfire> I used to every night, now i'm down to about once every 2 weeks.
<Polarfire> And It's still declining.
<RainBroDash> 0HEY now you guys get to imagine RBD fapping before he goes to bed, fun
<RainBroDash> 0GRATS
<SilverMane> alright, this conversation got more awkward than when we were tying each other up and eating syrup
<Polarfire> lol
<SilverMane> (I was syrup(
<RainBroDash> 0epic win. it's the sleep deprivedness
<RainBroDash> 0it drives me crazy
<RainBroDash> 0i apologise
<SilverMane> it's cool bro, peace you two.
<RainBroDash> 0peace

<Drake> 04*sigh*
<Drake> 04This is getting out of hand
<Ascendant> wtf
<Armageddon> what is, Drake?
<Drake> 04My story
<Drake> 04I've a few ideas but I really haven't thought the plot through properly
<Drake> 04I've really ignored the small little details, such as how Dyan could kick Anareta, Cynder, Spyro and Hunter's asses all at once and yet not defeat the three dragons later on.
<Drake> 04And then when I change it to that they STILL get themselves beaten, I'm left with a senseless departure by Dyan, leaving Irres just standing there.
<Ascendant> is anyone else getting an account suspended notice
<Ascendant> on TST?
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> believe me
<Armageddon> I've had troubles with that too
<Armageddon> there's always those little details

<Drake> 04I'm at a loss as to where to begin.
<Drake> 04Sort of like a mindmap except all the bubbles link to each other,
<Drake> 04So you can keep track of it. But...well, I don't know where to start.

<Espeon> 06I encountered a pony fan that said 4chan stole the "NO U" meme from bronies the other day
<prince-dari> LOL
<eXAKR> It is
<Espeon> 06I guess re-using memes with pony characters means they're NEW MEMES GUISE
<eXAKR> Someone need to crossover some Stephen King story with ponies
<Espeon> 06To some people at least
<Espeon> 06what

<prince-dari> I dunno could be possible though, "bronies" have been around a lot longer than 4chan.
<eXAKR> What
<Angel_Espeon> 13:/
<Angel_Espeon> 13Don't get me started on them again
<prince-dari> Since "brony" has always been a term for MLP fans, as long as MLP has existed.
<eXAKR> 80% of bronies are not creepy
<Espeon> 06Well, this guy was certainly not one of those who had been around longer than from when FiM started :P
<prince-dari> Although it used to be just male MLP fans.
<eXAKR> the 20% creepy are people like Luke Allen
*HyperMetalLugia gets back to 3DS
<Espeon> 06eXAKR, that goes with every fandom
<eXAKR> That even normal bronies laugh at oO
<Espeon> 06But the 20% feel like 200%
<prince-dari> Maybe he knew people who had been around that long. :P
<eXAKR> What.
<Ascendant> Yeah, and 99% of this channel cares about pronies
<eXAKR> I'm not creepy
<Ascendant> erm

<prince-dari> "but what's really happening is that turning its head reduces the energy going out through its airway, so the bark turns into a meow." Oh yeah, the other thing is that it turns back away from the person and is still meowing, the meow doesn't turn back into a bark when the cat turns it head back. This is wrong. :P

<prince-dari> orly

<prince-dari> nowai
<Apokalipse> yawai
<prince-dari> hoshiz
<SirSprinkles> 6That movie got a 2.6/10 on imdb... it's B.
<SirSprinkles> 6TWO. POINT. SIX.
<Apokalipse> No, a B movie does not equal a bad movie
<Apokalipse> a B movie is a movie with a low budget
<Apokalipse> Battlefield earth had a huge budget
<SirSprinkles> 6Our definition of B movie differs from the normal definition of it.
<Apokalipse> technically a B movie could be good
<Apokalipse> Then call it something else >.<
<SirSprinkles> 6Eeeeeeeeeeenope.
<Apokalipse> But it's the complete opposite
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a big-budget movie that was a huge flop.
<Apokalipse> Ahh It's like I have OCD
<Apokalipse> for B movies
<Apokalipse> ...Maybe I have OCD
<SirSprinkles> 6And we're looking to find a better name for the movie themes. So deal.
<Apokalipse> I'm not going to be here next week anyway. I would be there to complain though
<Apokalipse> Too bad I'll miss the godfather though
<Apokalipse> Even though I've seen it plenty of times
<Apokalipse> I'm going to miss al my BMN bronies

<SirSprinkles> 6I sleep for like, 2-3 hours and I'm good for another day or two.

<Ray> 02Hiya Night~
<NightSeas> 12Hello Ray
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm
<Ascendant> ohaidere
<HyperMetalLugia> heya scendant
<Ascendant> lolwut
<NightSeas> 12Hello Ascendant
<NightSeas> 12How have you been?
<HyperMetalLugia> Whoops, I mean ascendant
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02She's been a bit descending lately
<NightSeas> 12lol
<NightSeas> 12I see Arti has taken down the site to install SMF 2.0
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yes
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Or something
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> NightSeas
<nickstr> ugh
<Ascendant> No
<nickstr> I hate Simple Machines Forum
<Ascendant> lolwut
<Ascendant> SMF is awesome
<NightSeas> 12^
<Ascendant> If you don't like SMF, what do you like?
<Ascendant> PHPBB is a piece of crap
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Ascendant> IPB and vBulletin are expensive
<nickstr> no expandibility, overboard on puzzles for registration
<nickstr> poor features
<Ascendant> I like vBulletin, but honestly, SMF is the best free forum software
<Ascendant> lolwut
<Ascendant> You don't have to have those puzzles, and most of them are mods anyway
<Ascendant> You can change the difficulty of it and by default, there's only one
<Ascendant> And what do you mean by "no expandibility" and "poor features"?
<NightSeas> 12lol, I've never seen any puzzles XD
<nickstr> the puzzles were so difficult on the Simple Machines Forum based board I tried to register at it took three attempts
<Ascendant> Because people are idiots and decide to make it difficult lol
<nickstr> well you can't do much above and beyond what is normally there
<Ascendant> by default it's not hard
<Ascendant> but people install mods that just suck
<nickstr> vBulletin is expensive but its the most powerful forum software out there
<nickstr> lots of nice features for moderators and staff members
<nickstr> along with a good number for the normal users
<nickstr> not to mention social integration and arcades
<NightSeas> 12and for a price
<junh1024-XD> munnie$
<nickstr> Simple Machines Forum does not have crap in comparison
<nickstr> its bare bones
<Ascendant> <nickstr> vBulletin is expensive but its the most powerful forum software out there
<Ascendant> indeed it is
<Ascendant> And nickstr, SMF is free
<nickstr> but still
<nickstr> EWW SIMPLE MACHINES FORUM
<Ascendant> Not everyone has the money for vBulletin
<Ascendant> your choice
<Ascendant> SMF > PHPBB though
<Ascendant> PHPBB...urgh
<NightSeas> 12Ew people that copy drf by saying eww everything they don't like
<Ascendant> the administration panel made me shat brix
<nickstr> if I had the choice between Simple Machines Forum or no forum at all
<Ascendant> so, NightSeas?
<nickstr> I would pick no forum at all
<Ascendant> It's their choice
<Ascendant> lol
<Ascendant> I like SMF
<Ascendant> have you tried SMF 2?
<Ascendant> it's a lot better
<junh1024-XD> noforum=nocommunity
<nickstr> what "improvements" does it offer
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02NS :<
<nickstr> because maybe I will change my mind
<NightSeas> 12SMF 2 is pretty awesome. I don’t find it easy to code though
<Ascendant> Well
<Ascendant> It's a lot nicer-looking than the previous SMF
<Ascendant> The previous SMF was kinda old-looking IMO
<NightSeas> 12Very true
<nickstr> what improvements are there besides asthetics
<Ascendant> it has some pretty nice features and it's also more user-friendly
<nickstr> are the over the top puzzles gone?
<Ascendant> The over the top puzzles were mods that people installed
<Ascendant> by default it's only a pretty simple just letters puzzle
<Armageddon> ohaidere
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No one asked you
<nickstr> just like what I have seen with PHPbb, Proboards, and vBulletin

<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Ascendant> Pretty much
<Ascendant> But don't tell me that you prefer PHPBB
<Ascendant> ._.
<nickstr> I don't
<nickstr> I even did not like Proboards
<junh1024-XD> o nickstr have you seen AFX's WArp Stabilizer? It's very impressive : http://www.adobe.com/feature/aftereffects/warp-stabilizer.modaldisplay.1._s_content_s_dotcom_s_en_s_products_s_aftereffects_s_features.html
<nickstr> despite a forum I read quite a bit being based on it
<NightSeas> 12lol Proboards
<Ascendant> proboards is crappy
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> o.o
<NightSeas> 12All I can think of when I hear the word Proboards is free hosting
<Armageddon> ._.
<nickstr> which is basically it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lolforumotion
<nickstr> the forum on Proboards was oddly enough left to me and I wanted it off of there
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ohwait
<Ascendant> forumotion is actually decent for a free forum host
<Ascendant> Well, it used to
<Ascendant> before it forced all that sh*t on its users
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Like what? .-.
<NightSeas> 12So many advertisements though
<Ascendant> The admin panel was easy to use although it wasn't that configurable
<Ascendant> Yeah, the advertisements
<Ascendant> We used to be able to limit them to guests only
<Ascendant> or even disable them at one point, which I did
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Ascendant> And it stayed that way for a while because they didn't realise
<Ascendant> then I checked a year later, and kaboom, advertisements left and right

<SilverMane> Argh, still no one here!
<Armageddon> That's cool
<Armageddon> Silverwing I assume?
<SilverMane> All those wasted nights...
<SilverMane> As the blood slowly filled the goblet, as the breathes last escaped her cold lips, as the rise and fall of her chest ceased to come, eternity came to her.
<Gameboo> Yeah
<SilverMane> Darkness slowly fell, and the light fled her eyes, those soulful orbs turning to glass.
<Armageddon> You guys need an IRC again D:
<Gameboo> We do :D
<Armageddon> Make a channel here >|
<Gameboo> irc.synirc.net #tsi
<Armageddon> oh lol synirc
<Armageddon> why synirc?
<Gameboo> I dunno, it was there before and we just kept the tradition I guess
<SilverMane> 'Good night, my angel. Sweet dreams.' A voice rang out, echoing into the distance.
<Armageddon> hm okay
<SilverMane> The peaceful night, quiet and warm, was disturbed only by the quiet sobs of one who has felt the greatest of joys, and was blessed to witness its end.
<SilverMane> She turned, grasping the small cup close to her breast, and walked off, leaving her truest friend to nature, so that she may be returned to the earth.
<SilverMane> 'With this, you shall live on, in me, and everyone who ever knew you. The world shall never forget the name of...' her voice trailing off, words failing her as her lips trembled in grief.
<SilverMane> The next day, as dawn broke, only she was aware of what had happened.
<SilverMane> Only she knew the crimes of the prior night, only she knew what had been lost, and only she knew the course destiny has set before her.
<NightSeas> 12Back
<Light_Latias> 12wbs
<SilverMane> The memories of the last few years, times of love and joy, fear and pain, blessed innocence and jubilant wickedness, filled her mind.
<NightSeas> 12
<NightSeas> 12*Thanks
<SilverMane> I'm bored now. Have fun with this, if anyone is actually going to come on and find it.

<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<Ascendant> ._.
<drfsupercenter> 03it says sucks.com is already registered
<drfsupercenter> 03but it doesn't actually do anything
<drfsupercenter> 03odd
<NightSeas> 12You should also buy o3o.net
<drfsupercenter> 03why don't you do it

<Ascendant> pokemon.txt goes in C:\Documents and Settings\%USER%\Application Data\mIRC
<drfsupercenter> 03because that way
<Ascendant> nah
<drfsupercenter> 03you can use colors.txt and put the LIST OF ALLOWED COLORS *cough*
<Ascendant> that's bloated
<drfsupercenter> 03also rofl application data
<drfsupercenter> 03I keep mine in C:/sysreset

<drfsupercenter> 03soZ?
<drfsupercenter> 03-Z
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not like the script really lags.
<Ascendant> it lags the script more :p
<Ascendant> and besides
<Ascendant> my folder is big enough
<Ascendant> without having more .txt files
<Ascendant> I don't want to search through it
<drfsupercenter> 03one text files covers all the randomscripts though
<drfsupercenter> 03but w/e
<Ascendant> you can cover it in one line too :p
<Ascendant> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ascendant, you are a 9Blastoise.
<drfsupercenter> 03per script
<drfsupercenter> 03OW MY EYES
<Ascendant> Besides
<drfsupercenter> 03see what I mean
<Ascendant> the !pokemon script is complicated
<Ascendant> at least the new version
<Light_Latias> 12night all
<Light_Latias> 12~
<drfsupercenter> 03you know what you can do
<drfsupercenter> 03wait no
<NightSeas> 12Good night
<drfsupercenter> 03shoot
<drfsupercenter> 03because of the colors
<drfsupercenter> 03I was going to say
<drfsupercenter> 03store it like "A Blastoise" in the text file
<drfsupercenter> 03so that you can do "an Exeggcute" etc
<drfsupercenter> 03but that would mess up the colors :/
<Ascendant> nope
<Ascendant> a %color $+ Blastoise
<Ascendant> because $read can parse the % in the file as well
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03you can actually put that in the text file?
<Ascendant> Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03holy crap
<Ascendant> and besides
<Ascendant> I am NOT going through the list of 600 or so pokemon
<Ascendant> and add a/an in front
<drfsupercenter> 03then let me do
<drfsupercenter> 03*do it
<Ascendant> I could script it anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03just don't question if you get it back with no gen 5s
<Ascendant> I don't need to do it
*drfsupercenter hides
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> they're separated
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Ascendant> pokemon1.txt, pokemon2.txt, etc.
<drfsupercenter> 03can I replace everything in gen5 with "stupid creature"?
<Ascendant> lmfao
<drfsupercenter> 03I have access to scriptbot
<drfsupercenter> 03I want to
<drfsupercenter> 03so badly
<Ascendant> you'd just have to
<Ascendant> replace the file
<Ascendant> pokemon5.txt
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<NightSeas> 12Just do it to the ice cream pokemon, drf :D
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Ascendant> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03because they all suck
<Ascendant> you should see the part
<PTS> U get on Caaz
<PTS> ?
<drfsupercenter> 03ugh
<Ascendant> where the !pokemon script parses identifiers and such in response to the !setgen script
<drfsupercenter> 03brb reboot
<Ascendant> so it gets the correct lists
<Ascendant> that part is like 4 lines
<Ascendant> but god damn
<NightSeas> 12How do I make the .txt file, NS?
<Ascendant> put each pokemon/new variable on a new line
<Ascendant> so it's like
<Ascendant> pokemon1
<Ascendant> pokemon2
<Ascendant> pokemon3
<Ascendant> etc.
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<Ascendant> in the text file
<NightSeas> 12Sounds easy
<Ascendant> yes
<Ascendant> that's the easy part
<junh1024-XD> "sounds"
<Ascendant> it is easy though

<Ascendant> <SilverSonic> NS, thats all you do is show disrespect towards me
<Icydragon> ;P
<Ascendant> Give me reason to respect you then
<Ascendant> respect is earned, not given
<Ascendant> :p
<SilverSonic> Same with you
<SilverSonic> you dont respect me, i dont respect you.
<Suinide> *kisses*
<Icydragon> Get back to work pony
<Ascendant> I never asked for your respect, lol

<NightSeas> junh1024-XD, you are 15Brokenstar!
<SilverSonic> NS, its all you really do to everyone, you disrespect them.
<prince-dari> When I read that it looks more like warrior scats rather than warriors cats. Just sayin. :P
<junh1024-XD> I'm a Brokenstar! Brilliant!
<Ascendant> haha prince-dari
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, no I don't
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Ascendant> I respect nearly everyone else here
<junh1024-XD> i have no idea what warrior cats are.
<SilverSonic> you do NS
<SilverSonic> everyone here seems to treat me like crap
<Suinide> Yes masta
<prince-dari> Lawl, I don't really talk to you.
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, ever wondered why?
<NightSeas> 12[02:42] <junh1024-XD> i have no idea what warrior cats are. <-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_%28novel_series%29 Here you are
<SilverSonic> -_-
<Icydragon> MOVE I SAY *slaps*
<SilverSonic> NS because i seem to be the easiest target for everyone :/ *Sigh*
<junh1024-XD> I can stnd o3o. I can Stand my little pony. I can't stand warriorcats.
<NightSeas> 12wat
<Suinide> *whinneys and moves*
<NightSeas> 12Well
<NightSeas> 12You're alone on that one
<Ascendant> I wouldn't put it that way
<Ascendant> I'd say it more on the lines of "Why do people not like you?"
<Icydragon> o.=.o
<SilverSonic> w/e
<Suinide> ^.%.^
<Ascendant> Seriously, SilverSonic.
<Ascendant> I have a reason for everything I do
<NightSeas> 12Also junh1024, I thought you "had no idea what warrior cats are" lmfao
<Icydragon> Punk ass Suinide
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Suinide> Bitch butt Icydragon
<junh1024-XD> I do now
<Icydragon> NEVER
<Cynder7> 6I think I'll go to bed now..Hopefully finally get some sleep..It's almost 12 am.. >.<
<SilverSonic> NS, face it, you just dont care, you never have and never will.
<Ascendant> Don't care about what?
<Icydragon> hmmm
<SilverSonic> anyone or anything
<NightSeas> 12Read the books before saying you know anything about it @junh1024
<Ascendant> Are you really thick enough to believe that?
<PTS> 5am and I'm still awake
<PTS> Get at me
<SilverSonic> not really. but you act like it alot
<Suinide> Ever
<Cynder7> 6See ya later..hopfully..
<Cynder7> 6Bai.
<Ascendant> Just because I act like it doesn't mean I feel like it
<SilverSonic> yah right
<NightSeas> 12SilverSonic, you need to learn that sometimes Ascendant is just playing around with you
<NightSeas> 12In this weird truthful way XD
<SilverSonic> w/e shes just a troll
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, there are things I care about lol
<NightSeas> 12Na 0you are o3o
<Armads> STOP BEING SO MEAN TO EVERYONE ASCENDANT D:
<SilverSonic> NS, yeah right.
<Ascendant> ARMADS Y U SO MAD
<SilverSonic> I dont believe you NS at all.
<junh1024-XD> U AMD?
<Ascendant> lol SilverSonic
<Ascendant> rofl junh1024-XD
<prince-dari> U drama?
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, if I didn't care about anything, I wouldn't be alive :p
<Ascendant> haha Armads
<junh1024-XD> U MADOKA?
<NightSeas> 12But seriously, you make such a big deal out of everything Ascendant says to you SilverSonic
<UMADmads> I don't care about not caring, so I don't care enough to not care about living.
<SilverSonic> w/e
<Ascendant> lmfao Armads
<SilverSonic> she trolls thats what shes best at
<UMADmads> LOVE EACH OTHER~
<Ascendant> SilverSonic
<Ascendant> I don't exactly troll here
<Ascendant> I'm just blunt
<NightSeas> 12You're in a foreveraloneguy drama mood SS
<Ascendant> In regards to me, he usually is :p
<SilverSonic> shut up Nightseas, this isnt your arguement
<NightSeas> 12rofl
<UMADmads> XD
<UMADmads> umad?
<Kyu> 07how about all of ya shaddap :D
*Kyu disappears mysteriously
<Ascendant> Kyu, you always pop in during this :p
<Ascendant> and pop out
<Kyu> 07iknorite
<UMADmads> I wish we would. lol
<UMADmads> But I need a reason to not focus on work :D;
<Ascendant> And SilverSonic, lol, you get offended too easily
<Ascendant> haha
<prince-dari> Offended by someone over internet.
<prince-dari> Lulz
<SilverSonic> UGH, w/e NS
*SilverSonic slaps prince-dari around a bit with a Massive Wrench!
<UMADmads> DLL debugging is being a b***********
<Ascendant> <prince-dari> Offended by someone over internet.
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> UMADmads, that's why I don't do DLL debugging :p
<UMADmads> I wish I didn't do it either. rofl :(
<Ascendant> And SilverSonic, maybe listen to someone else's advice instead of trying to shove it off and pretend you don't need it?
<Ascendant> The first step is acknowledging the problem
<Ascendant> heh
<UMADmads> guess this is what I get for mixing like three languages into one program lolol
<Ascendant> lmfaao
<Ascendant> Try doing C++ classes
<SilverSonic> NS, how bout i just not listen to ANYTHING you say instead >_>
<UMADmads> This program runs on a C# UI with C++ and Lua stuff under it.
<Suinide> <3<3
<UMADmads> All written by me, but they aren't exactly integrating well. XD;
<UMADmads> They worked fine separately.
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, that's your problem
<Ascendant> You don't want to listen :p
<Ascendant> How about listening to what someone else has to say for once?
<UMADmads> but connecting them all causes things to go "LOOOOLLL (°Дo)???"
<Icydragon> hmmmmmmm
<Ascendant> haha UMADmads
<Ascendant> dlls are annoying as crap
<Suinide> Baby so hawt
<Ascendant> and I haven't done C# or Lua
<SilverSonic> No. NS, I can't be forced to listen to ANYONE
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, I'm not forcing you to, but you should be listening to advice
<UMADmads> I don't usually like C# but it's decent for building quick UIs.
<Ascendant> If you want people to stop laughing at you and thinking you're annoying, then listen
<UMADmads> And Lua is one of the most badass scripting languages out there.
<junh1024-XD> C++ classes are a bit cryptic
<NightSeas> 12Been taking lessons from Haii SS?
<Ascendant> If you don't, then by all means, continue with your arrogant attitude :p
<Icydragon> e_o
<junh1024-XD> in java, you can do x extends why
<Ascendant> rofl NightSeas
<UMADmads> And it works well with C/C++ stuff.
<junh1024-XD> *y
<prince-dari> Never even heard of Lua.
<Ascendant> java is annoying
*SilverSonic slaps NightSeas around a bit with a Massive Wrench!
<prince-dari> What's wrong with java?
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Ascendant> debugging java makes me want to go back into C++
<Ascendant> x-x
<prince-dari> I like java. :o
<UMADmads> I speak C++ almost more fluently than English, so I dunno what y'all mean by cryptic. XD;
<Ascendant> It's just annoying
<junh1024-XD> c++ runs faster tho
<Suinide> <3.=.<3
<Ascendant> it's good for some things
<Ascendant> and java has more bugs than my garden does
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<junh1024-XD> but java has inbuilt libraries for UI and graphics
<Ascendant> But yes, SilverSonic, I reinstate what I said
<Ascendant> True
<Ascendant> so does VB
<Icydragon> Eww
<Suinide> :(
<junh1024-XD> but VB is windoes-onry
<UMADmads> C++ is my bishie.
<SilverSonic> >>
<Ascendant> yeah
<UMADmads> Lua's getting there.
<Ascendant> VB is easy
<Ascendant> I prefer python and C
<Icydragon> ;3
<UMADmads> C#, not really but I'm forcing myself to get used to it lol
<SilverSonic> again NS, i dont give a crap what YOU say
<NightSeas> 12:3 Hi SilverSonic
<junh1024-XD> drf was trying to made a tag stripper UI in VB? and he gave up
<prince-dari> I heard C# was less powerful, or slower than C++.
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, you don't have to
<UMADmads> Only word I saw in that was "stripper"
<Ascendant> But you should at least listen and maybe take a hint
<Ascendant> You don't have to do what I say
<SilverSonic> Plus, you're not very good with advice regardless.
<junh1024-XD> C# is like Java, but made by microsoft
<Ascendant> But at east drop your cocky attitude :p
<Suinide> ^.=.^ *wicks*
<Ascendant> You'd be surprised, lol
<UMADmads> C# is slower than C++ 'cause it's managed. But it's faster and easier to build stuff with.
<SilverSonic> I dont have to NS
<Ascendant> C# sounds dodgy :p
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, as I said, you don't have to
<Icydragon> wha?
<UMADmads> I only use it for making UIs because I hate programming UIs. lol
<junh1024-XD> I also herd C# is "java done right"
<UMADmads> It gets 'em done quickly.
<Ascendant> But that's what a suggestion
<Ascendant> is
<junh1024-XD> I also herd "QT is easy to learn"
<Suinide> Licks
<Ascendant> heh, QT is decent
<Ascendant> I like it more than C
<UMADmads> Microsoft asserts that C# is better than Java, but honestly I don't give a damn. lol
<NightSeas> 12Actually, NS seems to be pretty good at advise giving XD
<Ascendant> but C is more powerful
<Ascendant> derp
<SilverSonic> GL, like i give a crap
<UMADmads> C and C++ are my primary languages and I'm stickin' to 'em.
<prince-dari> What's Lua like? I haven't heard of it before.
<Icydragon> ewwwwwwwwwwwww
<UMADmads> At least I would be if this DLL would quit being a friggin jackbrat.
<Ascendant> Heh, UMADmads, I like C more
<Ascendant> C++ makes me want to go back to COBOL even
<Ascendant> or FORTRAN for that matter
<Suinide> *cries*
<Ascendant> :X
<Ascendant> COBOL is horrible XD
<Ascendant> and SilverSonic, you should
<UMADmads> prince-dari, Lua's a scripting language pretty much built to work with C/C++.
<SilverSonic> well NS, I dont
<Ascendant> I suggest that you calm down and actually look at the bigger picture
<Ascendant> Right now you're not taking reason at all
<UMADmads> The syntax of it's pretty easy to get, and it's fast and easy to integrate too.
<SilverSonic> why should i
<Ascendant> Bloody hell, you sound like a christian, no offence
<prince-dari> Ah, sounds good.
<Ascendant> to any christians that is
<Ascendant> You're blinded by your feelings
<SilverSonic> Umm..hello, I was a christan thank you.
<SilverSonic> >>
<Ascendant> Am or was?
<Icydragon> shh
<SilverSonic> idk to be honest
<Ascendant> I meant that as an analogy
<UMADmads> I'm in the process of using it to build a game HUD that can be modified during gameplay. It's coming along rather smoothly :D
<SilverSonic> UGH
<Ascendant> Not actually trying to offend anyone who is christian
<SilverSonic> just w/e
<Ascendant> Nice, UMADmads
<SilverSonic> I dont care, nor will i care.
<Ascendant> I haven't done proper programming for months
<Suinide> *lick*
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, that's the attitude that will have people dislike you
<Suinide> *licks?*
<Ascendant> And treat you the way they do
<Ascendant> You're just so stubborn and your refusal to change and listen to others is what annoys people
<Ascendant> Stubbornness is not going to help, and never will
<SilverSonic> nor is your trolling
<Ascendant> I'm not trolling
<SilverSonic> You DO troll
<SilverSonic> stop lying
<SilverSonic> its annoying
<junh1024-XD> thenagain, there are loads of people here that won't change their ways about something
<Ascendant> I do troll, but I'm not trolling
<Ascendant> Yes junh1024-XD, that's true
<SilverSonic> yes, you troll alot
<Ascendant> and people need to change
<SilverSonic> like you
<Ascendant> I don't troll that much here, SilverSonic
<UMADmads> So what? All awesome people troll. lol
<NightSeas> 12Advise! =Trolling
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, in what way(s)?
<SilverSonic> you need to be nicer for one
<SilverSonic> stop trolling 2nd
<UMADmads> I fail to see how she isn't being nice right now. rofl
<SilverSonic> not be so fking blunt all the time
<Ascendant> I am honestly at a loss of what to say to that lol
<Ascendant> I don't know whether to laugh or cry with laughter
<junh1024-XD> is this discussion going anywhere ?
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, I AM nice
<UMADmads> Not that I can see. lol
<SilverSonic> You ARENT
<Ascendant> And I don't troll
<SilverSonic> STOP FKING LYING
<Ascendant> that much
<UMADmads> But I'm getting a kick out of it all the same.
<SilverSonic> you're never nice
<SilverSonic> at all
<Ascendant> What about now? lol
<SilverSonic> you arent
<Ascendant> How am I not being nice?
<SilverSonic> you constantly disrepect me
<Ascendant> Lol, that doesn't answer my question
<Ascendant> How am I not being nice?
<SilverSonic> bloody fck i gave you an answer
<Ascendant> And I do respect you, just not when you're being stupid
<Ascendant> Yes, and that answer is?
<SilverSonic> yeah right
<Ascendant> Answer?
<SilverSonic> you never had one ounce of respect the moment ive arrived here
<SilverSonic> you treat me and a few others like crap :P
<Ascendant> lol, your view of me saddens me )':
<Ascendant> Honestly, I do sometimes, I know that
<SilverSonic> really now?
<Ascendant> But that doesn't mean I don't have respect
<Kyu> 07oi, removing one letter from a swear word doesn't make it ok to use here
<Ascendant> lmao Kyu
<Ascendant> You should be saying that to me >:
<Kyu> 07also Ascendant, if he doesn't like you so much then either don't talk to him as much or be nicer
<Kyu> 07o3o
<Ascendant> hey, I AM being nice right now
<SilverSonic> yeah right
<UMADmads> Notice SS
<Ascendant> I don't understand how I'm not being nice lol
<UMADmads> she isn't the one swearing.
<UMADmads> XD
<Ascendant> lmao
<SilverSonic> *Sigh*
<Espeon> 06what
<Ascendant> SilverSonic, open your eyes lol
<Kyu> 07a person can't say whether they're nice or not, it all depends on the opinion of others lol
<Ascendant> That's true
<SilverSonic> and i've heard others opinions about her
<Ascendant> But I don't see anyone else saying I'm being mean, unless you are :p
<SilverSonic> people tell me things >>
<Ascendant> I know people don't like me
<UMADmads> ASCENDANT Y U SO MEAN :( :(
<NightSeas> 12I think NS is being perfectly nice rofl
<Ascendant> ARMADS Y U SO SAD ): ):
<Ascendant> derp
<Kyu> 07I'm saying if someone's thinking you're being mean, then that doesn't mean you're being nice
<Kyu> 07I'm not saying either
<Kyu> 07=P
<Ascendant> lol
<Espeon> 06<UMADmads> So what? All awesome people troll. lol <- I can't say anything else than this but
<Espeon> 06The stupid burns D:
<Ascendant> Heh
<Ascendant> He can at least tell me how I'm being mean right now
<Kyu> 07and more importantly
<Espeon> 06trolling because it's awesome is like swearing because it's edgy and hardcore
<Kyu> 07!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Kyu for 12 minutes
<Espeon> 06in other words retarded
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> Trolling isn't awesome lol
<UMADmads> :(
<Espeon> 06and if you think Ascendant is trolling SS
<Kyu> 07because your drama is so much less interesting than purple floof
*Kyu cuddles
<Kyu> 07:3
<Espeon> 06please update your definition of trolling
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Espeon> 06and don't take me seriously either mads, I just have more pet peeves than I should
*Espeon flops on Kyu
<UMADmads> lol, fair enough
<Ascendant> Xeli has "pet" peeves
*Ascendant hides
<Kyu> 07well, you're being blunt
<Ascendant> The fact remains I could be more blunt
<Kyu> 07and being blunt is the mean version on being truthful
<Kyu> 07=P
<Espeon> 06And while it's not always needed
<Espeon> 06sometimes it is
<Ascendant> I'm being truthful and not completely blunt :p
<Icydragon> pony...
<Kyu> 07truth that isn't necessarily something that wants to be heard by someone is generally considered blunt, depending on the person's tolerance
<Kyu> 07i.e, that dress totally does not make you look fat
<Kyu> 07at all.
<Kyu> 07:'D
<UMADmads> lol
<Ascendant> lmfao
<UMADmads> I thought bluntness was determined by how few words you used. lol
<Ascendant> hahaha
<Kyu> 07well
<Kyu> 07that too
<Ascendant> Kyu, sometimes being blunt is the only way that works :p
<Ascendant> And I'd prefer to tell people the truth rather than dodging around the topic
<Ascendant> And reasonably, I'm not exactly being THAT blunt either
<Ascendant> lol ragequit
<Suinide> Pony...
<NightSeas> 12Yep
<Armads> okay I'm done being evil for now XD;

<Ascendant> I always toe the line, Iskra :p
<Iskra> doesn't everyone? this is just closer than most
<Armads> Ascendant is secretly a professional tightrope walker.
<Ascendant> lmfao Armads
<Armads> I should get back to making this program not broken-like.
<prince-dari> "Some men see things as they are and say why - I dream things that never were and say why not."
<Armads> how very deep :o
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Iskra> "Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome."
<Suinide> :3
<prince-dari> Hmm, life isn't always pleasant.
<prince-dari> Some people have horrible lives.
<Icydragon> ;3
<Iskra> in general the life is more pleasant than the transition.
<Armads> I can imagine. lol :(
<Armads> sadly though I don't actually have experience with dying.
<Armads> that'd be a weird thing to put on a resume.
<Suinide> ;3
<Icydragon> >;3
<Suinide> :0
<Icydragon> :<
<Suinide> ;3
<Iskra> "The best evidence yet for the existence of intelligent extra-terrestrial life is the fact that they haven't tried to contact us."
<Armads> rofl
<Armads> that reminds me of another one
<prince-dari> C-C-C-Combo breaker!
<Armads> "Some people spend all their time and effort searching for intelligent life on other planets. I think they have their priorities wrong; I'm still trying to find it here on Earth."
<Icydragon> Cool story b ro
<Armads> or something like that
<Icydragon> *bro... gay
<Iskra> "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."
<prince-dari> Cool story brony
<prince-dari> "If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."
<Icydragon> Yes...
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH5TR6dtVzU
<Icydragon> I wish I had these balls
<Suinide> Hey hey hey
<Suinide> Crushing on someone elses balls? How could you?
<Icydragon> No, I mean I wish I had the balls to walk into a toysrus and buy my little pony shit
<prince-dari> I would, but you can't get any MLP merchandise over here. >_>
<Iskra> "The difference between theory and practice is that, in theory, there isn't one." </a nerdier one>
<Suinide> Ah
<Suinide> Your a wuss
<Icydragon> I came so close to getting Princess Celestria, but my uncle was with me, so I bought a transformer... one I wanted at least, but I wanted her
<Suinide> Ima buy oo her
<Armads> lol
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> So funny.
<Icydragon> Nah, I can do it
<prince-dari> Physics brony has some real balls though.
<Suinide> Fine then
<Icydragon> It's a pride thing
<prince-dari> ^ Balls, massive ones.
<Icydragon> God I wanna do that so bad
<Suinide> Dick
<Icydragon> What?
<Suinide> Lol using my own excuse against me
*Ascendant derps
<prince-dari> "There are only 10 kinds of people in the world. Those who understand binary, and those who don't"
<Ascendant> rooooooofl
<Icydragon> stfu *cries and combs Fluttershy's hair*
<Armads> there are only 10 kinds of people in the world: those who understand ternary, those who don't and those who mistake it for binary.
*Armads runs
<Suinide> No dont cry
<Icydragon> Ya know what, when I get my money, I'm gonna do it, and with pride
<Kyu> 07"If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then I have two patents and you have bad business sense."
*Kyu disappears
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<junh1024-XD> inb4: two cows
<Suinide> We'll see
<Suinide> So will i
<Suinide> Im gonna go up to the cashier look them staight in the eye an buy only a mlp item
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Icydragon> Hell yeaj
<Icydragon> *yeah
<Suinide> :3
<eXAKR> bbl
<eXAKR> Also Applejack Appletine drinks.
<eXAKR> *Appletini
*eXAKR RUNS
<prince-dari> Applejack is a real cereal.
<Icydragon> DKNBV
<Ascendant> why do I think of Applejack as something incredibly wrong? ):
<Suinide> :0
<prince-dari> "If Rainbow Dash dashes off, does Applejack jack off?"
<Armads> ohey, I fixed the DLL.
<Icydragon> It's not a party if you go alone...
<Armads> I wasn't initializing the test data.
<Armads> lololol
<prince-dari> Take this.
<Armads> so now I officially have three languages working in tandem.
<Armads> I feel awesome yet at the same time like I did this in the most convoluted way possible.
<Armads> lol
<Ascendant> lmfao
<prince-dari> The awkward moment when a cashier asks you "is the for someone else" and you say "Nope".
<Ascendant> get sublime text 2 >|
<Ascendant> text editors <3
<Armads> lol :(
<Suinide> Its only akward for them if you have big balls
<Armads> I'm using Visual Studio 2008 for C# and C/C++ and Notepad++ for the Lua.
<Icydragon> Shit, people give me weird looks when I buy transformers, this is gonna be fun
<Ascendant> lol VS
<Ascendant> >compiling on windows
<Armads> lol yeah
<Ascendant> might as well try and compile Xeli into an espeon or something
<Ascendant> >|
<Armads> I'm not awesome enough to use Linux unlike someone else :(
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> I prefer linux because it's not as bloated as windows :p
<Armads> fair enough lol
<Ascendant> and of course, compiling isn't as hard :D
<junh1024-XD> inb4: ubuntu
<Ascendant> ew ubuntu
<Ascendant> xD
<Espeon> 06That's a reason that actually makes sense
<Espeon> 06xD
<Ascendant> XD
<Armads> I had Fedora on Morgana for a while but never figured out how to do anything XD;
*Armads too lazy to research stuff
<Ascendant> ubuntu is like the linux version of windows
<Ascendant> if that's possible to explain
<junh1024-XD> I herd fedora is very cutting-edge
<Ascendant> fedora is apparently getting better
<Icydragon> lol did I tell you about the time I went into and apple store and put ponies anthrology on all the ipads?
<Ascendant> haven't tried 15, and the last one I tried was 14
<junh1024-XD> like. lots of updates, all the time
<Ascendant> ubuntu has a lot of updates .-.
<Armads> Yeah, they release a new version every what, six months?
<Suinide> You did me
<Ascendant> yeah they do
<Suinide> But your probably talking to him so ima go away
<Ascendant> fedora has crap integration with its desktop environment
<Ascendant> which annoys me
<Armads> I still have the disc of F14 in case I wanna go back, but I dunno. I'd have to set aside the time to learn it lol :(
<Ascendant> I prefer linux mint 9 for personal use
<Armads> and I'd rather be doing code. :P
<Ascendant> well, linux mint in general
<Ascendant> haven't tried 11 and 10 is meh
<Ascendant> Haha
<Ascendant> it's so much easier to code on linux
<Ascendant> because compiling doesn't require you to explode
<Armads> boom
<Ascendant> XD
<Icydragon> Nah
<Armads> I like how Microsoft's threaded compiler locks up your computer though. rofl
<Icydragon> Both of you
<Armads> That's how you can tell Microsoft made it.
<Armads> you literally can't do anything while it's running XD
<Ascendant> rofl that
<Ascendant> I go to compile
<Ascendant> and then realise too late it does that
<Ascendant> then fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<junh1024-XD> i've got an old version of gcc & c++ for windoz
<prince-dari> Lawl, no, I hadn't heard that before.
<Ascendant> you can get bloodshed's compiler
<Armads> okay I felt so awesome that I got all three of my languages into one program
<Ascendant> which is pretty good imo
<Ascendant> nice :p
<Armads> that I forgot what exactly I was doing with it in the first place.
*Armads dɹəp
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> Microsoft surface is win.
<Ascendant> lmao
<Icydragon> I'm pretty open about my fandom, no one questions it, which worries me
<Armads> I should just make it a challenge to myself to integrate all the languages I know into one giant patchwork program
<Armads> that does nothing.
<prince-dari> LOL
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> have you guys tried COBOL?
<Ascendant> just doing "Hello World" takes like...10 linues
<Ascendant> lines
<Ascendant> even
<Ascendant> .-.
<prince-dari> Hahaha, wow.
<Armads> XD
<Armads> that sounds fun :(
<Ascendant> FORTRAN is also horrible
<Armads> Brainf*ck would be a fun language to try.
<Armads> That and FALSE.
<Ascendant> lol bf
<Ascendant> haven't tried it
<Ascendant> bbl piano
<Armads> I like piano. :O
<Ascendant> xD

<prince-dari> She's probably pink though.
<SilverSonic> yeah that
<prince-dari> Because Hasbro sucks at Celestia.
<SilverSonic> yeah
<SilverSonic> XD
<prince-dari> I was more talking about the main 6.
<prince-dari> And if he has a Celestia toy he probably ordered it from another country.
<prince-dari> Because MLP FiM only just hit the UK on the 4th of July.
<Silverscreen> Dari, are you there?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<eXAKR> I want Nightmare Moon figurine
<eXAKR> I will go nuts over it

<eXAKR> Yeah prince-dari
<eXAKR> Hasbro does advertises on buses in Singapore
<prince-dari> Someone already updated the site I think.
<eXAKR> I saw a bus with an advert for Nerf Guns
<prince-dari> Probably Sprinkles, I know he added a countdown timer to the next stream.
<eXAKR> and Nerf Guns are made by Hasbro
<Silverscreen> That's kinda cool
<eXAKR> Next: My Little Pony Friendship is Magic
<eXAKR> WITH NERF GUNS?!??!??!??!?

<HyperMetalLugia> Bad pun
<Pattyrick|ALT> Ping, much?
<Light_Latias> 12<3

<Pattyrick|ALT> Hi baad
*baadf00d skateboards on the wall
<Light_Latias> 12<3 <3 @long ;3
<baadf00d> ohi.
<Hooh54> 05I didn't relise the long XD
<{NiGhTmArE}> (Won't you..)
<Lati> 12FINALLY able to get the eevee event thing on the global link =P
<Hooh54> 05And the Link part
<Pattyrick|ALT> What about floofEevee?
<Rurik> 4Cuz you touch yourself
<{NiGhTmArE}> That's not enough.
<Icydragon> 13Eww
<Pattyrick|ALT> How do I switch to my regular name?
<Pattyrick|ALT> just the typical /nick?
<baadf00d> /nick <newnamehere>
<baadf00d> yup.
<Pattyrick|ALT> ok
<Pattyrick|ALT> hmm
<Pattyrick|ALT> not letting me switch
<Pattyrick|ALT> stuck on Alt =/
<Link> LOL
<baadf00d> /nickserv ghost Pattyrick <passwordhere>
<Icydragon> 13You grabbed my ass
<HyperMetalLugia> Whee
<baadf00d> if there's no password you just have to wait for your old nick to ping out.
<{NiGhTmArE}> I have a lot of nightmares.
<Pattyrick|ALT> Ok
<Pattyrick|ALT> So what does that do?
<baadf00d> Now you can switch back to your old nick.
<baadf00d> It does some internet magicks.
<baadf00d> and makes things work.
<Pattyrick> awesomeness
<Icydragon> 13No Ayumi, those aren't nightmares, it's just reality
<Sneas> 03y
<Armads> it's the equivalent of kicking a microwave to make it work properly.
<{NiGhTmArE}> And sometimes, I can feel the pain
<Link> Very bad but funny pun
<Armads> except with half the risk of getting your foot stuck in it and microwaved along with your chili.
<Pattyrick> lol
<Skylands> 10Bah
<Pattyrick> That's funny because I had chili for dinner
<Skylands> 10I read Link and long next to each other
<Armads> I know. :o
<Pattyrick> and because you wre Armads
<Skylands> 10Bad images in my head
<Pattyrick> *were
<Cynder7> 6@ Dari : where's the thing in the picture?
<Armads> lol
<prince-dari> There is no lake.
<HyperMetalLugia> Long link
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Armads> I'm always too lazy to ghost my nick. I just wait for it to ping out.
<Pattyrick> how does it ping out?
<Cynder7> 6o.o Cliff ftw?
<Armads> Internet magick.
<Icydragon> 13Oh I see it now
<prince-dari> If you look at this you'll realise, then look back.
<Pattyrick> Any idea why it forced us both to switch our names?
<Armads> Server tries to check if your nick is alive, and if it gets no response after X amount of time, it pulls the plug.
<Pattyrick> ok
<Pattyrick> makes sense
<Ghost> LMAO
<Armads> Ghost is just a way to accelerate the process.
<Ghost> What sky sees as bad images, LL sees as paradise with Link
<{NiGhTmArE}> You don't take the time to understand me. You never had, all you do is judge for what I do, when you should be looking for what I am INSIDE.
*Ghost RUNS
<Skylands> 10Truth
<Cynder7> 6xDDD
<Pattyrick> hmm
<Armads> I'm not actually sure why it happens, but sometimes nicks just get randomly lost and you reconnect with an alternate one.
<Armads> Internet magick is not always stable :(
<Pattyrick> D=
<Cynder7> 6If you wanna be accepted and understood here,how the hell does the spamming help?
<Armads> it is known to go horribly awry
<Armads> hopelessly at the mercy of Al Gore's whims.

<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Armads> If there's more to life than pizza and Coke then I've yet to discover it.
<Pattyrick> I had some good pizza at a restaurant in Idaho
<Pattyrick> At a mostly Montana chain
<{NiGhTmArE}> I call a truce.
<Light_Latias> 12|3
<Armads> Is Montana really a place?
<Rurik> 4I call an eviction
<Pattyrick> I think so
<Armads> I thought they were just like "hey, we need a name for this void between here and Canada"
<Pattyrick> I think it's more like acquired land
<Pattyrick> exactly
<Pattyrick> the western half is cool, the eastern half is excessively boring
<Pattyrick> it's the kinda state where you'd want to own a fast car
<Armads> lol, I can imagine.
<Pattyrick> speed limits on the main highways are 80 MPH and there are no cops
<Armads> Long highways with nothing to run into.
<Pattyrick> 65 in construction zones xD
<Armads> rofl

*Hooh54 runs from the squeals
<Icydragon> 13Reminds me of Dotm Megatron:We need a truce, after all your nothing without me. Optimus prime:*rips megatrons head off with an axe*
<Pattyrick> there are a lot of fast cars and rich people in Florida
<Pattyrick> but then there's also a very high rate of homelessness and poverty
<Spyrorocks[Air]> lol
<Armads> And college kids and old people.
<Pattyrick> the state with both extremes
<Armads> but you knew I'd say that. lol
<Spyrorocks[Air]> My magstripe reader = awesomeness
<Pattyrick> would you fall into the only possibly applicable one?
<prince-dari> What are you doing with it?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I copied my staff id to a starbucks gift card
<Spyrorocks[Air]> haha
<prince-dari> LOL
<suicune> jared licks my penor
<Spyrorocks[Air]> they will be all like wtf when i show up.
<prince-dari> That's quite cool.
<Armads> I dunno actually, considering I'm not in college anymore.
<Jared> nuhuh
<suicune> uhhuh
<Pattyrick> you're just sorta there?
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Im going to copy my bank card to a starbucks card too
<Armads> yup.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> just for more wtfs
<Armads> lookin for a way and a reason to gtfo.
<Pattyrick> you have the reason
<Pattyrick> heat, traffic, tourists
<Armads> though honestly the way things are going in the short term
<Armads> I might have a job here in town in a few weeks XD;
<Pattyrick> ok
<Pattyrick> cool, maybe
<Armads> which is partly cool because I'll ya know
<Armads> have a job
<Pattyrick> what kind of job?
<Armads> but it sucks because well, yeah.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> any other suggestions for funness?
<Armads> Programming military training sims.
<Pattyrick> wow
<Pattyrick> I hope to be able to design roller coasters and other thrill rides
<Armads> I got to see their equipment and stuff the other day.
<Pattyrick> maybe work for a big design firm or a manufacturer
<Armads> Wasn't allowed to take pictures but it was pretty mind blowing XD
<Pattyrick> wow
<Pattyrick> I could imagine
<{NiGhTmArE}> Does anyone know how to make a Thrash Metal melody w/ Drums in FL Studio?
<Pattyrick> my dad's in the Navy, that's why we're here
<Armads> I have family in the Army, but that's not why I'm here lol
<Icydragon> 13Nope
<Pattyrick> brb, I need some milk
<Spyrorocks[Air]> No one wants to make emo music.
<Armads> I came here for college alone, and then this company comes shooting in
<Armads> from Honolulu of all places
<Armads> and they're looking for programmers.
<{NiGhTmArE}> It's not "emo".
<Armads> so I figure why not lol
<Ray||Touhou> 02so much black D:
<Armads> I take offense to that you racist >:(
*Armads shot
<Pattyrick> back

<Pattyrick> I had to get another half glass for some enjoyment lol
<Armads> I do that a lot lol
<Ray> 02there.
<Ray> 02:3c
<Armads> and then I wonder why milk never lasts in my house XD
<Pattyrick> milk never lasts in my house
<Pattyrick> my doctor took the awesomeness out of milk
<Pattyrick> told me to switch to skim because I love it too much D=
<Hooh54> 05Uh, 4Chan for that, guys>
<Armads> lolol
<Armads> I've never had problems with mi-
<Armads> nevermind I definitely did
<Armads> in the past
<Armads> I dunno if I used to be allergic to it or what lol
<Pattyrick> we finally started drinking Lowfat, but he wanted us to go further
<Armads> then one day I decided I hated not drinking milk.
<Armads> so I started drinking it again
<Pattyrick> thanks to milk, I've never broken a single bone
<Spyrorocks[Air]> hey Aristeo
<Armads> and all has been well ever since.
<Rurik> 4Yeah it is
<Rurik> 4cuz you made it
<Spyrorocks[Air]> whats the mode to limit the amount of lines per second from a user in your room
<Pattyrick> nomm
<Pattyrick> y
<{NiGhTmArE}> ?
<Armads> lol, I've never broken a bone because I'm always in a seated position and never doing anything active.
<Armads> XD
<Pattyrick> xD
<Pattyrick> That'd almost be the case for me
<Pattyrick> except for the fact that I've played basketball ever since 1st grade

<Armads> I slept a marathon this weekend too.
<Pattyrick> I'm good on some nights, but worse on others
<Armads> I had really bad insomnia about a month ago lol
<Armads> That was fun.
<Pattyrick> oh my
<Armads> It's the equivalent of a broken leg in any other sport.
<Pattyrick> I've had insomnia on some occasions, but not often
<Armads> I get it pretty often lol :\
<Armads> Part of the reason I hate being human so much.
<Armads> If I were just a brain in a jar everything would be fine.
<Pattyrick> more like 'hard time getting to bed because I just got off of the computer and went straight to my bed'
*Ray||ZzZzZ yawns
<Pattyrick> how could you use MIRC?
<Pattyrick> D=
<prince-dari> Because mIRC is full of win.
<Armads> I'd have wires that let me use computers. lol
<Pattyrick> I've heard of that before
<Pattyrick> hi pd
<Icydragon> 13lol
<Spyrorocks[Air]> heh
<Armads> My nervous system would be wired into a bunch of machines instead of a body.
<Icydragon> 3{NiGhTmArE}: your getting booooooooring
<Pattyrick> there was this woman who (I think) became quadroplegic and had a wire connected to her head that allowed her to use a compuer
<Spyrorocks[Air]> he isnt really a nightmare :P
<Armads> There's also Stephen Hawking. lol
<Armads> He's getting there.
<{NiGhTmArE}> Electronica? or Breakbeat (Drum 'n' Bass)
<Pattyrick> is that the guy with the robot voice?
<Icydragon> 3Figures *goes op on him*

<Armads> Black holes and stuff. He's a smart dude.
*prince-dari can hear the text. XD

<Armads> without the IQ of over nine thousand.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> hey ppl

<Icydragon> 3Nah
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> it was pretty good
<Hooh54> 05Lol
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> especially the cgi
<Armads> Like how Tama is "the first cat to hold a managerial position at a train station."
<Rurik> 4I turned it off after 10 min
<Rurik> 4god
<Armads> not normally the kind of thing cats aspire to.
<Rurik> 4I ahted it
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
<Suinide> My sister watched it, i saw it for a few seconds and hated it
*Pattyrick wonders what kind of aspirations his cat has
<Suinide> I guess thats unfair but still
<Armads> My cat aspires to
<Armads> exist
<Armads> so far it's not coming along too well sadly :(
<Icydragon> 3Suinide: WHat did I tell you about talking out of turn?

<prince-dari> Oh I forgot, world domination.
<prince-dari> Evil cats.
<Icydragon> 3*slaps* Punk ass kids these days
<Armads> yes of course. lol
<Armads> Cats normally aspire to take over the world, so it's odd that one would be content with a train station :(
<Pattyrick> my cat has the aspiration to sit somewhere where she can be warm
<Armads> unless it's all a part of her bigger scheme.
<Pattyrick> absorb the heat
<Pattyrick> then one day

<Quanyails> 7I might have to talk with Rora.
<Espeon> 06Next sunday, because then parents are away and such xP
<Barry> Hipster_Brony: The movie is Clash of the Titans (2010)
<Espeon> 06While they do not mind ME staying up late, they just go "oh we can't sleep when you're still up"
<Espeon> 06so yeah
<mobileDCD> guys I just heard the most depressing news story
<Quanyails> 7Okay, I'll make note.
<Hipster_Brony> 8clash of the titans is a B movie

<Barry> ah
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i will slap you if you ever pick it

<Angel_Espy|Homework> 13Whooo~
*Quanyails 7blinks at the TF2 blog. O3o
<Barry> Whichever one had the guy transforming in a college walkway
<Pattyrick> it's the Floofy Bunch!
*Pattyrick runs
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think that was the ed norton one
<Barry> and attacked by the love interest's father and the army
<mobileDCD> so who is testing broadcast?
<Hipster_Brony> 8both would probably be A movies

<mobileDCD> oh sorry I just assumed that when you said "let's hope that doesn't happen during a regular broadcast" you meant something in a current streaming
<Espeon> 06:333

<SirSprinkles> That's sathi

<Silverscreen> oh, I see.
<Silverscreen> And we're still on the fence about Soarin and Dman
<SirSprinkles> Dman...
<Silverscreen> Oh, i know. She freaking LEADS an online community group.
<SirSprinkles> Soarin is getting a Test Run, as I said.
<Silverscreen> What about Dman?
<SirSprinkles> And sathi will probably get insta-hired as RBD did.
<SirSprinkles> I wasn't there for Dman's interview, or at least not most of it.
<SirSprinkles> So I have little to say on him.

<HyperMetalLugia> I would
<HyperMetalLugia> >:(
<drf-Droid> lots of people

<drf-Droid> yay pirating viruses?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes :p
<drf-Droid> >defective by design
<Pattyrick> yum Jailbreak for something
<drf-Droid> same with iPods, etc
<Ray> 02yay, pirating and not getting viruses
<SilverSonic> ^
<drf-Droid> or so you think
<drf-Droid> you do realize
<SilverSonic> blah blah blah
<drf-Droid> good viruses tell your antivirus not to report it
<HyperMetalLugia> The average iOS has more holes than a unpatched Windows XP os
*HyperMetalLugia yawns
<SilverSonic> drf: i dont feel like listening to your opinions, so im gonna kindly ignore your assessments w/o the use of ignore.
<drf-Droid> right, all I'm saying is Sony = evil, that's not just my opinion
<Ray> 02Soo..... then again, I've had SVP8 since like 3 years
<Skylands> 10Meep
<Ray> 02nothing has happened yet to my pc
<drf-Droid> the only things Sony makes that I like anymore are their cameras
<SilverSonic> drf, again, You're opinions mean nothing to me, mine only matter to me
<drf-Droid> and entry grade headphones, but it's kinda hard to get viruses from headphones
<HyperMetalLugia> The only Sony products I like are their old laptops, TVs? and PS1/PS2
<drf-Droid> their Trinitron CRTs were awesome
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<drf-Droid> Bravia LCDs suck though
<drf-Droid> and yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> They're meh
<drf-Droid> Sony became evil about a year after releasing the PS2
<HyperMetalLugia> I think all my/most of the LCDs here are Panasonic
<drf-Droid> YSS
<drf-Droid> *YEs
<Pattyrick> drf, would you happen to hate my Panasonic Viera?
<drf-Droid> Panasonic is like THE best brand of TV
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay
<drf-Droid> Pattyrick, read what I just said
<HyperMetalLugia> I have a DRF approved TV
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<drf-Droid> I have a 50" Viera
<Pattyrick> wow, something I have that you like
<drf-Droid> nah
<Pattyrick> OMG!
*Pattyrick runs
<drf-Droid> the only thing better than panasonic for TVs is Pioneer
<HyperMetalLugia> I have two 52in Verias in my house XD
<drf-Droid> and those are like $4000
<drf-Droid> HML, plasma?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<drf-Droid> as EW LCDS OVER 42"
<drf-Droid> good.
<Pattyrick> my dad got our 48" (I think) for free, thanks to a raffle
<HyperMetalLugia> Has to be plasma anyway
<drf-Droid> no
<drf-Droid> they make 42" LCDs
<drf-Droid> but they suck
<drf-Droid> I have a 32" LCD Viera, that one is nice
<drf-Droid> and a 50" plasma
<HyperMetalLugia> The largest LCD I have had is a 32 in Panasonic...I think
<drf-Droid> it may weigh more but plasma is the best thing yet
<HyperMetalLugia> That one got stolen
<drf-Droid> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus our small 19in kitchen TV
<drf-Droid> you can have mine if you fly over here and get it
*drf-Droid runs
<HyperMetalLugia> But we replaced it with a cheaper and larger LED TV XD
<drf-Droid> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Forgot the price, but around 350-400$ for a 24 or 23 in XD

<Polarfire> I go check it
<Polarfire> I see where youre coming from, but that's kinda the first thing that comes to people's minds when they read it.
<Quanyails> 7Well, my tentative schedule is from 2:00 to 6:00 AM GMT.
<Quanyails> 7Not all four hours, but depending on who can come.
<Polarfire> IMO.
<Quanyails> 7NightSeas, how's that?

<Aristeo> rawr!
<Espeon> 06I'm not sure if I can be there for that =s
<Hipster_Brony> 8true
<Quanyails> 7D:
<Espeon> 06But TF2 related, going to the official valve servers allowed me to see a funny mix of massive douchebag newbies, elitist "veterans" bashing them and a few cool newbies actually trying to learn.
<Espeon> 06It was fun to kind of rally the troops and beat the opposition in a stacked game ;v;
<Quanyails> 7I can't make it too early or late...
<Quanyails> 7Unless I change the date.
<Quanyails> 7But I want the most people to come. :3
<Light_Latias> 12rhyme
<Espeon> 06Yeah, timezones xD
<Light_Latias> 12o3o
<Polarfire> Why did the two leave? They'll more than likely come back at some point. I don't ponychan a lot.
<Quanyails> 7Espeon, is that early or late in your timezone?
<Espeon> 06well it would be 3:00-7:00 am, wouldn't it? And that combines both late and early :P
<Roara|Dinner> lol
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Espeon> 06But if it was a week later I could probably be there around that time regardless xD

<Quanyails> 7Okay...
<Quanyails> 7Eh, Rora, how's a week after?
<Hipster_Brony> 8with the constant drama

<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Ascendant> or well
<Ascendant> I think I put it at 50 actually
<Ascendant> not sure
<Hipster_Brony> 8for people like me and steven though, ponychan is more than just an internet site
<Quanyails> 7The max is 32, I think.
<Hipster_Brony> 8its a community, and it was our home
<Hipster_Brony> 8he felt like it had changed permanently, and he didnt want to be a part of it anymore
<Espeon> 06I think 32 is the max "recommended" setting anyway :P
<Ascendant> Well, I can't remember
<Polarfire> well, in the case of a sour community, I think part of it is boredom. There's no new stuff and hasn't been for awhile.
<Ascendant> Since I'll be away on the 17th
<Ascendant> I'll give Xeli access to the server

<Lambda> you know what other old show I like?
<Lambda> Arthur
<Mikey> I never really got into arthur :C
<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> how about magic school bus?
<Mikey> I like how the show seemed more honest about life though like that episode where dw was asking about the swear word and it was a bleep rather than some dumb made up word
<Mikey> never liked msb either
<Armageddon> heya Quilava :3
<Lambda> yeah, I remember that episode
<Armageddon> Viri was looking for you earlier
<Lambda> how about... digimon?
<Lambda> jk
<Mikey> :P

<lighty> Oh..
<Lambda> oh wow
<Quilava> yeah, he poked me on MSN
<Mikey> cause sometimes when he was being my part time teacher when he still lived here we'd watch it and imitate it on our break
<Lambda> did you imitate any of the characters, or were you always the same one?
<lighty>
<lighty> Ffff, nvm
<Mikey> yeah I did hahaha
<Mikey> "rain rain go away" "HURRRR AND DON'T COME BACK"
<SirSprinkles> 6He was checking in to see if the chat was still having problems.

<Lambda> oh yeah, it's been a while since I've watched it
<lighty> I tried that map too....
<Mikey> the big blue one is ord, the pink one is cassie, and the two headed green and purple one is zach and weezy
<lighty> I commence checkpoints
<lighty> Like i ever make them......
<Lambda> my sister and I liked Zach and Wheezey the most
<Mikey> me too

<drf|laptop> 03god you know what sucks Aurora
<Aurora> 6that leaves the 6th movie for either tomorrow or wednesday
<nickstr> techno or dance music
<Ray> 02It took me like 200 tries to pass that map
<Aurora> 6because both parts for 7 are on thursday
<drf|laptop> 03you know how I said we get to se HP7.2 the night before it comes out

<junh1024-XD> well nickstr , I use the M1 theme from the english M1 OST for testing AAC bitrate & quality, ofc, it's already amplitude-compressed
<nickstr> true
<lighty> Off to work
<nickstr> this is for a compressor/limiter for audio levels
<lighty> More jackhammering walls today
<junh1024-XD> there's a pokemon italian dance mix somewherre,
<lighty> And placing a tube or something.....
<junh1024-XD> 2BAM?
<lighty> Anyways BBL
<nickstr> its for broadcasting to protect from overmodulation on air
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah, Aurora, I'm gonna have to resort to eseing it like Friday or Saturday night
<drf|laptop> 03at least I can see it in the IMAX htat way
<Armageddon> ah
*Armageddon hugs Quilava too :3
<nickstr> I actually have to attenuate the midrange a bit to prevent voice peaks from distorting
<nickstr> but there seems to be no appreciable consequence if the attenuation is slight
*nickstr np: Barbi Schiller - Misty's Song (Radio Remix) [03:57m/320kbps/44kHz]
<nickstr> I am using this for a test now
*Quilava squeaks
<junh1024-XD> ok
<nickstr> no pumping in the audio
<nickstr> so it seems the separation between the frequency bands in the compressor/limiter stage is wide enough
<Lambda> well, I shoud be getting sleep for work
<Lambda> I have to work early
<Lambda> see you tomorrow probably
<Mikey> alright bye
*bed rapes stuff
<Quilava> can rape me.. :P
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/41/portal-tshirt.html
<nickstr> I also have azimuthal correction going due to a sort of stereo boost I am running
<junh1024-XD> hm, ein isn't here. owel,
<nickstr> without it the stereo image wanders a bit and the boost exagerates it
*Armageddon thinks
*bed raped him and that's why he quit
<junh1024-XD> nickstr http://www.mediafire.com/?iusk2hccqga89uq < this is the kind of music-driven effects-intense stuff that I work on. & drf|laptop , this is what you can't do in Corel Video Studio. I need After Effects for this.

<Ascendant> we were referring to that :p
<Ascendant> Besides, I don't jump on people just because I can, lol
<prince-dari> I just need to set up services now.
<Armageddon> DRAKE
<lighty> Ok....
<SirSprinkles> 6Awesome.
<lighty> Nice email adress.....
<Drake> 04NIGHTSHADOW
<prince-dari> Then I can look into writing some server modules, like wordfilters.
<lighty> Who was drunk again?
<prince-dari> On everyone, lulz, etc. XD
<Armageddon> :D
<SirSprinkles> 6...can you take off the stupid emotes?
<SirSprinkles> 6I HATE emotes.
<prince-dari> No, that's mibbit.
<prince-dari> You can turn them off in mibbit though.
<SirSprinkles> 6...FAWK
<prince-dari> Just click on the a smiley.
<prince-dari> It should turn into normal text.
<SirSprinkles> 6:)
<SirSprinkles> 6...I love you dari
<SirSprinkles> 6:D
<prince-dari> Haha, no problem. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6:(:/:P:O;)
<SirSprinkles> 6:)
<SirSprinkles> 6FAWK
<SirSprinkles> 6It doesn't stay that way... =(
<SirSprinkles> 6Guess I'm stuck using =
<SirSprinkles> 6I just like using : for : D
<NightSeas> 12Well, seeya everyone
<prince-dari> Maybe you have to turn each individual smiley face off?
<Pattyrick> bye GL
<lightumbreon> 06g'd bye GL :
<SirSprinkles> 6I do.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's dumb.
<NightSeas> 12Bia
<Pattyrick|Away> I need to help my mom with something, but I'll be back in a few minutes
<SirSprinkles> 6Are you sure you can't write a script for it?
<prince-dari> Nah, that's not possible, because it's just something that mibbit does.
<prince-dari> Mibbit should have a setting to turn them off though.
<lighty> Switching to pc....
<lightumbreon> 06yup, back
<prince-dari> If you're really bothered you could set up this java SSL proxy, then redirect the places where the mibbit smiley faces are stored on the internet to somewhere on your computer, and have the ones on your computer look like normal smiley faces.
<SirSprinkles> 6...ew. Work.
<prince-dari> Except they wouldn't have the same colour as your text, they'd be a fixed colour, and other people wouldn't see them like that.
<SirSprinkles> 6...ew. Pointless work.
<prince-dari> How It Works
<prince-dari> see Prefs -> Smileys (main client or widget manager):
<prince-dari> Width: The width of the smiley when shown.
<prince-dari> Height: The height of the smiley when shown.
<prince-dari> Base URL: The common first part for all icons in the URL column.
<prince-dari> Code: Mibbit searches for the code of each line of text for this, and replaces it with the picture hosted on the Icon URL.
<prince-dari> URL: The second part of the URL to an image that will replace the text found in Code (or a file name if server/path is common for all icons).
<prince-dari> You can turn them off then.
<SirSprinkles> 6Bleh.
<SirSprinkles> 6I want them turned off for everypony, is the thing... *shrug*
<prince-dari> That's not possible then.
<SirSprinkles> 6Because mibbit is FAIL
<SirSprinkles> 6But we've already established this.
<prince-dari> Unless I finish making my own client, which I'm too lazy to do.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe some day.
<prince-dari> I was going to have it so you could play games with other people over IRC, pretty sure no other IRC client does that.
<SirSprinkles> 6Maybe some day.
<SirSprinkles> 6That. Would. Be. Win.
<SirSprinkles> 6Put pony games on it. =D
<prince-dari> Story of the blank flanks.
<prince-dari> "!!Spike & !!Twilight leaving are the most notable and sad of these changes..."
<SirSprinkles> 6You going to be there for the stuff on Wednesday?
<prince-dari> They left? O_o
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yesterday.
<prince-dari> Why?
<SirSprinkles> 6Dunno.
<SirSprinkles> 6Likely all the recent mudfests finally got to them.
<SirSprinkles> 6It is a shame though...
<SirSprinkles> 6!!Spike even asked to be permabanned with no appeal.
<SirSprinkles> 6And was.
<SirSprinkles> 6Turns out he was Steven Magnet.
<prince-dari> That's weird, !!Spike didn't seem like the kind of person to just give up to me, I'd never really seen !!Twilight speak.
<SirSprinkles> 6!!Spike had been talking recently, especially to the GETters, about how ponychan was going to hell.
<SirSprinkles> 6and !!Twilight always had a short fuse.
<SirSprinkles> 6Granted, !!Spike's fuse wasn't exactly the longest, but not nearly as bad as !!Twilight's.
<prince-dari> I can't even remember anymore, Steven Magnet is a fan name, right?
<prince-dari> It's just that's all I've ever called the serpent.
<prince-dari> So I find it hard to think it could be anything otherwise.
<prince-dari> Oh, did you ever get your Applebloom trip Sprinkles?

<prince-dari> Not like neon lights then?
<SirSprinkles> 6Not like neon lights.
<Umbreon> 12XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Though if you made it flashing colors in the shape of neon lights, that would be AWESOME.

<Armads> What program, Roara?
<Armads> lol
<Aurora> sorry had to restart
<Aurora> I've got DAZ and Bryce now
<Armads> ah, I've got Maya lol
<Armads> not that I use it but XD
<Aurora> yeah I was considering maya
<Aurora> but both DAZ and Bryce are legitimately free
<Aurora> so
<Armads> I got a free copy through my school. :(
<Aurora> plus they're apparently really good software, I've heard of bryce
<Aurora> ....lol
<Armads> I might actually still have a product key you can use.
<Armads> if you wanna try it.
<Aurora> nah
<Aurora> its ok
<Armads> k lol
<Aurora> I love deciding to drop out of a contest
<Aurora> and then deciding to go back into it 4 days before the round is over
<Aurora> and i haven't even really started my entry
<Aurora> woot
<Armads> XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Indecisiveness ftw?
<Aurora> ^
<Sparky> o3o
<Pattyrick> drf would hate you, but I'll o3o too just for the sake of it
<Pattyrick> xD
<Armads> I'll hate you instead :O
<Aurora> it's one thing for someone to use the face
<Pattyrick> 0__o
<Aurora> it's another for someone to acknowledge that it would get someone mad
<Aurora> and then use it
<Pattyrick> True
<Armads> sounds like something I would do.
<Pattyrick> My trip to Gardaland got cancelled D=
<Pattyrick> and it was the trip that kept me from going to the TST meet!
<Armads> XD
<Armads> My lack of cash kept me from going~
<Pattyrick> the teen center is incredibly unreliable
<Armads> speaking of lack of cash
<Armads> wonder if I'll be able to go to PAX next month...
<Pattyrick> the time difference would make you explode, Armads
<Aurora> my incredible distance + lack of csh is keeping me here
<Aurora> stupid
<Aurora> california
<Armads> nah, I'm pre-exploded.
<Armads> so I'm cool :d
<Sparky> o3o
<Armads> My sleep schedule is inverted here, so who knows maybe I'd be fine in GMT XD
<Pattyrick> if only I could go to that 50's diner in Coronado again...
<Armads> I almost went to Paris this month too but
<Armads> jeez I hate being poor.
<Armads> If I had three wishes I'd spend all of 'em on cash.
<Armads> ending world hunger can wait.
<Armads> I wanna travel. :\
<Pattyrick> brb
<Sparky> why was there so much hair on my desk lol
<Armads> Is it shedding?
<Armads> :(
<Sparky> I dunno
<Aurora> I shed all the time
<Aurora> it's horrible
<Sparky> but I'm cleaning my desk, right
<Sparky> turns out that half the reason it looks so dirty
<Sparky> is 'cause there's hair on it
<Sparky> the other half is eraser shaving
<Sparky> s
<Armads> rofl
<Aurora> sounds like my desk lol
<Armads> Reminds me of my one friend's 360 that had problems with shutting off randomly
<Aurora> actually
<Aurora> sounds like half of my room
<Armads> turns out it was overheating because its heatsink was clogged.
<Pattyrick> back
<Armads> there was so much dust in it that
<Armads> in his own words
<Armads> it had fused together into a rug.
<Armads> he picked at one corner of it and it all peeled away in one piece.
<Aurora> LOL

<SirSprinkles> 6Does it work now?
<prince-dari> Might not work with colours.
<Flutterpeanut> 13Uh
<Flutterpeanut> 13If it kicks once it wont kick again
<prince-dari> I could make it work when you say the command are are using colours, but I'm lazy. :P
<Flutterpeanut> 13But I am not a mod because I need to register this name
<Flutterpeanut> 13Which I have no idea how to do.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's supposed to eventually ban, isn't it?
<prince-dari> You don't need to register the name.
<Sparky> going t'the dentist's now
<prince-dari> And no, per request it just kicks once.
<Flutterpeanut> 13Oh, I don't?
<SirSprinkles> 6...oh.
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, whatevs.
<prince-dari> I asked how it should work and was told to let the mods deal with the person if they get kicked and continue using colours. :P
<prince-dari> So Sprinkles.
<prince-dari> How fast do you want the rainbow to move across the text?
<Flutterpeanut> 13Hmm.
<Flutterpeanut> 13What's the command to register again?
<prince-dari> Email is optional.
<Hipster_Brony> 8what have i missed thus far?
<Sneas> 03:3333333333333333

<SilverSonic> ohai Ascendant :)
<UxieLover> 11Hello
<Icydragon> hi
<Flutterpeanut> 13Well. Bronypeanut is outdated.
<Flutterpeanut> 13So yes.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll change it in the access list then.
*lightumbreon just launched: Unreal Tournament GOTY (1998/1999) DEDICATED SERVER (beta)
<UxieLover> 11How are you?
<Flutterpeanut> 13Also it'll stop me from accidently typing in Bronstate than Bronypeanut
<Flutterpeanut> 13Because I've done that like 6 times now
<Icydragon> Tired
<Flutterpeanut> 13Yey.
<Flutterpeanut> 13Now you can demod the other name
<SirSprinkles> 6Already did.

<Pattyrick> Yeah, however you spell Lesomethingko
<Pattyrick> xD
<prince-dari> Sprinkles, did you ever answer me?
<Armads> lol
<UxieLover> 11I wonder how DSD is doing?
<Armads> code forehead-oko.
<Icydragon> He's usually quiet
<SirSprinkles> 6...about?
<Pattyrick> Code Floridoko
*Pattyrick runs
<prince-dari> [18:36] <prince-dari> How fast do you want the rainbow to move across the text?
<Armads> florida is known for its enormous forehead actually.
<prince-dari> So like !!RD's name, but how fast should it move across?
<Pattyrick> No, it's known as America's
<Pattyrick> uhh
<Pattyrick> nvm
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, I did not see that.
<Armads> swamp
<SirSprinkles> 6About the same speed.
<Armads> they needed a place to put all the swamps
<Armads> so they drew straws
<Armads> and florida
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, updated the About Us page.
<Armads> with its huge forehead
<prince-dari> I don't remember what speed it goes across.
<Armads> got stuck with them and all their humid glory.
<Sathi> hello
<Pattyrick> yay
<prince-dari> Find me one of !!RD's posts.
<prince-dari> Hey Sathi.
<Armads> ...
<Armads> I know I don't hear an ice cream truck right now.
<SirSprinkles> 6One moment.
<Sathi> is the letter to hasbro sent yet?
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi sathi
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, i sent it yesterday
<Sathi> ah, I wonder how they will react
<Sathi> and if they will react at all..
<Hipster_Brony> 8no idea, im not expecting anything to happen really
<SirSprinkles> 6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/res/20623.html
<Sathi> hehe that's the best expectation
<Sathi> just wait and see
<SirSprinkles> 6He's the first reply, dari. :D
<Sathi> anyway I shall leave you all, see you tomorrow
<prince-dari> Ok.
<SirSprinkles> 6See you then, Sathi
<Hipster_Brony> 8bye sathi
<Armads> haha, "frozen ice on a stick"
<Armads> because no one wants regular ice on a stick.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh and btw sprinkles, TF2 doesnt work for me
<Armads> it's gotta be the frozen kind.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it lags worse than starship troopers
<SirSprinkles> 6...not surprised.
<Pattyrick> regular ice that isn't frozen is just water
<Pattyrick> that instantly falls
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, it lags hard on me.
<SirSprinkles> 6So I'm not surprised at all.
<Armads> if it fell off the stick it'd just be water :(
<Pattyrick> hi, Feather =D
<Armads> but it's water that stays on the stick.
<Kyubey> 02FEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR
<Feather> 10hi~
<Feather> 10RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
<Kyubey> 02:3
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, holy fork, it's Tuesday and I have both movies already... Oo
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<SirSprinkles> 6I actually have all 3 Godfathers. XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8btw, this is going to be far and away the longest movie night
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<SirSprinkles> 6Did DCD tell any of you anything about what we're planning to do since it's Brony Appreciation Day?
<Pattyrick> Mississippi home girl Feather, you be!
<SirSprinkles> 6Other than the banner dari's working on...
<Feather> 10yup
<Hipster_Brony> 8no, but i was literally about to ask you
<SirSprinkles> 6I suggested we stream the first two eps so that they end at 7 PM.
<SirSprinkles> 6Since they'll never get picked in a lotto anyway.
<Pattyrick> born in Mississippi, raised in... Washington -_______-
<SirSprinkles> 6And it would be unfair to the lotto winners to stream any other eps.
<Flutterpeanut> 13I'm quite intruigued. Hopefully my flash plugin wont fucking die every 3 seconds.
<Flutterpeanut> 13I have yet to see godfather.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DAH
<Hipster_Brony> 8HOW HAS NO ONE SEEN THE GODFATHER?!
<SirSprinkles> 6I have. :D
<prince-dari> I have.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I'll be watching it again tonight to make sure it works.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ive seen it like 10 times
<prince-dari> Though I fell asleep during the second and third ones. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have 3 movies saved on my computer
<Hipster_Brony> 8the godfather
<Hipster_Brony> 8godfather part 2
<Hipster_Brony> 8and the hurt locker
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> Wait wut happened to the third one? :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz those are 3 of my favorites
<Flutterpeanut> 13Haven't seen all 3 of those
<Hipster_Brony> 8the third one is garbage
<Hipster_Brony> 8not worth watching
<Flutterpeanut> 13xD
<Hipster_Brony> 8 3rd godfather movie i should say
<Flutterpeanut> 13Meh. I just don't watch a lot of movies.
<Hipster_Brony> 8everyone should see the godfather though
<Hipster_Brony> 8one of the greatest movies ever
<prince-dari> Ok, done Sprinkles.
<prince-dari> I'll just render it and upload.
<prince-dari> Then you can tell me it's crap. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6:D
<SirSprinkles> 6Guarantee it's better than anything I could do.
<prince-dari> It looks how you said you wanted it at any rate.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, guys.
<SilverSonic> ohai Feather /late
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going to be guest commentating on The Brony Show next Monday. : D
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<SirSprinkles> 6And seeing as they plug us most shows, I think we should at least plug them this week.
<prince-dari> 41 tabs on chrome, computer so slow, firefox open, photoshop open, 5 mIRC networks and 2 clients open. 11 folders open.
<SirSprinkles> 6And make them a partner when we start doing that.
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://knowyourmeme.com/system/icons/2085/original/Kornheiser_Why.JPG?1267079689
<Hipster_Brony> 8that was directed at dari, not you sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<prince-dari> I open stuff then never close it.
<prince-dari> XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, for sure
<prince-dari> Well I keep open stuff in chrome to show other people later.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i had a short chat with circuitmane last night, but we were both busy
<prince-dari> So I end up spamming 50 links at some of my poor IRC friends.
<prince-dari> And they say "Wut" then ping out.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, I was talking to him in depth last night.

<Hipster_Brony> 8where are we putting the banner up, in place of the normal one?
<prince-dari> The early stage: "WHY CAN'T I STOP WATHCING THIS?!?!"
<SirSprinkles> 6I was going to put it under the normal one.
<prince-dari> stages*
<Hipster_Brony> 8as long as its not in the viewing field
<Hipster_Brony> 8could get distracting
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, it won't be.
<SirSprinkles> 6The countdown clock is barely in the viewing field.
<SirSprinkles> 6And it'll be well above that.
*lightumbreon closes the server for maintnance and bedtime
<SirSprinkles> 6It'll be between the regular banner and the site links.
<lightumbreon> 06Gnite all
<Espeon> 06~
<Lati> 12seeya
*Espeon wonders if that's actually Feather playing TF2 under a rather odd name right now or if it's someone trying to be witty.
<Ghosties> 4Wow, so many mods together today
<Ghosties> 4Any reason in particular?
<Hipster_Brony> 8boredom?
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, working on a few things
<SirSprinkles> 6Mostly boredom.
<prince-dari> LOL
<Hipster_Brony> 8like the banner dari is making
<prince-dari> Ahahaha, you two are the same person.
<SirSprinkles> 6Which is really something I thought up, ran by DCD, and then asked dari to make...
<Ghosties> 4What's the banner idea?
<Flutterpeanut> 13I got yelled at to keep a tab up in here. AND SO I DID.
<SirSprinkles> 6A rainbow banner for Brony Appreciation Day
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<SirSprinkles> 6http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/Banner-3.gif
<SirSprinkles> 6First prototype.
<SirSprinkles> 6He's putting in an exclamation point at the end.
<Ghosties> 4Looks good
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, DCD and I were discussing what we'll do as an event for it, since it's Friday.
<SirSprinkles> 6We tentatively decided on streaming Eps 1 and 2 at a time to have them end at 7 PM
<Ghosties> 4So airing the pilot
<Ghosties> 4Nice
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6Since they'd never get picked in the lotto
<SirSprinkles> 6And playing any other eps in a marathon would be unfair to the lotto winners.
<Ghosties> 4No, yeah, that's fine. I wouldn't think it's fair to the ep winners wither
<Ghosties> 4*either
<SirSprinkles> 6Obviously this would have been run by you guys tomorrow... luckily you're all just on today. XD
<Sneas> 03WUT.
<Ghosties> 4I saw that Hip was playing TF2 earlier. Is it running well?
<SirSprinkles> 6EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEnope.
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
<Hipster_Brony> 8deleted it from my laptop cuz it doesnt run AT ALL
<Hipster_Brony> 8well
<Hipster_Brony> 8it dies technically
<Hipster_Brony> 8does*
<Hipster_Brony> 8but its so laggy that gameplay is impossible
<Ghosties> 4Shame
<Ghosties> 4Oh, Sprinks
<Ghosties> 4I heard that RBD sent you a guest pass for Killing Floor
<Ghosties> 4Have you tried it yet?
<SirSprinkles> 6I have.
<SirSprinkles> 6Offline.
<Armads> it could be Feather trying to be witty.
*Armads shot
<Ghosties> 4What did you think?
<SirSprinkles> 6Love it.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd be playing it now if I could.
<SirSprinkles> 6But my steam doesn't work at this wifi... ;-;
<Glass_Arm> Pfft, at least you aren't phone tethering as your only option
<Ghosties> 4Dude, you need to get someplace where you can play it so we can do a session
<Ghosties> 4Before your pass expires
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<SirSprinkles> 6I was hoping you'd be on earlier, since I could play on the wifi I was using then...
<prince-dari> Lawl, added the exclamation mark wasn't as simple as it seemed.
<prince-dari> I had to redo the whol thing. XD
<prince-dari> whole*
<Ghosties> 4Well, I'm on now Sprinks
<Ghosties> 4Glad you got it working, dari XD
<NightSeas> 12!Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to NightSeas for 15 minutes
<NightSeas> 12:3
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6That sucks dari...
<prince-dari> So now there are two versions.
<prince-dari> More shiny and less shiny.
<Ghosties> 4But yeah, I sent you a friend request (or added you to my friends list) on Steam
<prince-dari> I'll upload, you guys tell me which one you like more.
<Ghosties> 4So, you should know when I'm on Steam, send me a message through chat (through Steam, I mean) and then let me know when you're ready to play
<Angel_Espeon> 13Question, NightSeas
<Angel_Espeon> 13Were you Gold? o3o
<SirSprinkles> 6Cools.
<Angel_Espeon> 13You'll know what I mean if you are xD
<NightSeas> 12Nope XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah, alright then xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13it IS you who signed up though, right? o-o
<prince-dari> How do you feel about word filters on the IRC? I think it'd be pretty funny.
<NightSeas> 12Yes
<prince-dari> Especially people's reactions.
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Just wanted to make that clear in my mind xD
<NightSeas> 12Ah I see :3
<SirSprinkles> 6I think it would be hilarious.
<prince-dari> More shiny: http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/Banner-sparkle.gif
<prince-dari> Stronger colours: http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/Banner-less_sparkle.gif
<SirSprinkles> 6I like the stronger colours version.
<Ghosties> 4I'm against wordfilters on IRC
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Ghosties> 4I am
<SirSprinkles> 6For some words, Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6Like, necessary ones.
<Ghosties> 4Nigger?
<Ghosties> 4Seriously?
<Ghosties> 4How often do we get people saying something like that in here?
<Ghosties> 4More importantly, how many use it as a form of trolling?
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, I'm saying we could impliment them as we need to.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think we should do it for the lulz one week
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just the option of having them, really.
<Ghosties> 4If we do implement them, do it for the laughs
<Ghosties> 4Not for "safety"
<SirSprinkles> 6Just put a TON of wordfilters in, Hipster?
<Hipster_Brony> 8no no
<prince-dari> I meant more lulz -> for the enjoyment I anticipated experiencing after performing said activity
<prince-dari> Not serious word filters.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, but not have it ALL THE TIME
<Hipster_Brony> 8make them for funny stuff
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, yeah, that's cool dari.
<Ghosties> 4Like, one BMN just have it on
<Hipster_Brony> 8like have TOOT filter to FLOOT or something like that
<Ghosties> 4But just for the laughs and that's it
<prince-dari> FLOOT!
<SirSprinkles> 6MOOT?
<SirSprinkles> 6I am ultimate troll. :D
<prince-dari> Should filter no -> yes one day just for the lulz.
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh god
<Hipster_Brony> 8that would be so confusing
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, no
<Ghosties> 4Or yes
<Ghosties> 4No as in "no"
<Ghosties> 4However
<Ghosties> 4That does bring up the idea of April Fools Day if BMN is still going by next April
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6That would be hilarious.
