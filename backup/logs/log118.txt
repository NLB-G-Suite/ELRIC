<MetalRainbowDash> Give it up for Roberto. Who won the contest before it started.
*Fluttershy pulls away a bit later, simply breathing hard and staring at Silvermane. "You...."
<MetalRainbowDash> Yes.
*herospirit absconds to his corner
<MetalRainbowDash> She is.

<Octavia> 13Ick.

<SixSpeed> Pony slang for BUTTS.
<MetalRainbowDash> It's..
<Dark-Frost> !datplot
<GRRM> I had to make a bunch of plots in matlab today
*Silvermane 15was away for ONE FUCKING MINUTE and now has no idea what to do or say
<MetalRainbowDash> Wierd.
<GRRM> goddamn it was hard
<GrimGallop> lol
<SixSpeed> matlab is horrible
*DecapKing 4starts to go towards the bed to restrain Fluttershy again
<ValtheJean> whoever remains there is just a lost soul to me now :P
<GRRM> lol
<GRRM> it is
<MetalRainbowDash> (Roleplay Timein)
<Luna> 07soooo you want a newsletter?
<SuperBrony64> What "chat", there's a lot of ponies in the auditorium still.
*Fluttershy turns to glare at DecapKing. "Rrr..."
<Silvermane> 15DecapKing, leave her be please
<SixSpeed> I don't even know how you could make a decent-looking plot using matlab.
<Luna> 07I can send one if you wish
<mexican> im back
<ValtheJean> yes, you know it's gonna be alright
<SuperBrony64> (the hell does that mean? lol)
<MetalRainbowDash> Yeah, but they're quiet.

<SixSpeed> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
*DecapKing 4steps back
<GRRM> plot(x,x+1)
<SixSpeed> Nope.
<VioletVanilla> 6If it is from you yes! :DD
<GRRM> there that's a plot
<Spin> !muffinkiss
*DerpyBot regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches Spin, showing her most adorable kissing face
<Luna> 07yes yes )
<GRRM> in matlab and it still looks like ass
*Fluttershy huffs, turns back to Silvermane, suddenly quiet.
<RainbowDashCancel> oh god, this conversation
<VioletVanilla> 6I. . . . I think I might Val. . .
<GrimGallop> Maybe somebody needs to get them all to make some NOISE!
*ValtheJean is content now :P
*MirthTinker 13flies out the window, sobbing softly. "Oh, I had no idea..." She flaps wobbily and disappears into the night.
<mexican> !flip
*DerpyBot flips a muffin
<SuperBrony64> Well, they're just speechless after that performance
*DerpyBot catches the muffin with her hoof, correct side up
<MetalRainbowDash> Oh.
<RainbowDashCancel> plot is a math thing
<SixSpeed> GRRM, I mean literally. Plot = butt.
<Silvermane> 15Dammit Tink...
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, the party at Sugarcube Corner?
<MetalRainbowDash> Well guys Imma go to bed.
<MetalRainbowDash> Cya.
<RainbowDashCancel> plot is also pony slang for butt
<Xiagu> !link plot macro
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<MetalRainbowDash> We can continue this tomorrow
<Xiagu> :/
<RainbowDashCancel> and now ass was mentioned
<DecapKing> 4should i try to go after her?

<Spin> mexican; agreed
<SixSpeed> thatsthejoke.crx
<RainbowDashCancel> trying to read all the statements in different contexts is hilarious XD
<Luna> 07you need to be added to the list..
*MetalRainbowDash and all the other ponies arrive at Pinkie's Party.

<MetalRainbowDash> Pinkie Pie! The party legend!
<Silvermane> 15Fluttershy... *sigh* well now ain't I in quite the bind.
<SuperBrony64> Congratulations to Roberto!
<Octavia> 13I said yes a while ago Luna :P
<MetalRainbowDash> Yep.
*GrimGallop noms cake
<MetalRainbowDash> Cheers to the first and only person to win the contest and a good singer!
<MetalRainbowDash> Cheers.
<RainbowDashCancel> Trying to make plots (pony butts) in matlab
<Octavia> 13Last time we talked about the Newsletter <3
<RainbowDashCancel> lulz
*DecapKing 4goes towards the door, and looks back at the bed as he goes out the door
*Fluttershy looks down, voice soft again. "Sorry..."
<User_4389> ponies are awesome
<SuperBrony64> Person? What's that?
<ValtheJean> but as for improvements
<MetalRainbowDash> Roberto.
<ValtheJean> again, the more stuff we have to announce
<ValtheJean> the better our newsletter looks
<MetalRainbowDash> Defining Person, Roberto.
<Xiagu> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/4839
*ValtheJean points to idea thread he made today
<Spin> User_4389: PFFT Ponies are gay grr I like FOOTBALL!
<Xiagu> also User_4389 , your nick is very similar to that ponibooru link
<SuperBrony64> Oh ok
<Skipsy> Yeah... streaming is a no go until I can get the NST to look at my connection.
<GRRM_> damn my internet is terrible
<GrimGallop> (The one human in Ponyville, of course.)
<Silvermane> 15No Shy-Shy, I'm sorry. I never meant to mislead you. I'm not that promiscuous despite what the rumors say. Although I am a bit friendly towards fillies, it's partly hero complex.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about macro rarity twilight_sparkle plot fluttershy
<MetalRainbowDash> Wh..
<ValtheJean> also Sathi, if you want me to handle the emails I'll more than happily do that for you
<Xiagu> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/4839
*DecapKing 4starts to go after MirthTinker as fast as he can with a bruised groin and broken rib
<SuperBrony64> (That wasn't in the program >_<)
<MetalRainbowDash> No, he's a pony.
<Gorge_RR_Martin> dammit
<Gorge_RR_Martin> my internet is terrible
<SuperBrony64> Well of course
<RainbowDashCancel> I once got a "default" username here called "User_1337"
<Gorge_RR_Martin> ...so
<mexican> who knows some good fanfic?
<SuperBrony64> He's standing right over there
<Gorge_RR_Martin> I was about to ask you guys
<MetalRainbowDash> I don't think there are HUMANS in ponyville.
<RainbowDashCancel> and for that moment I was extremely awesome
*Fluttershy ears lower as she listens, nodding dumbly. "Oh... I... I see."
<Luna> 07e-mails is fine i'm more concerned about the looks of our newsletter
<Gorge_RR_Martin> why do you call horsebutts plot?
<MetalRainbowDash> Ponyville + Human don't match.
<Spin> mexican: what are your preferences?
<SuperBrony64> Never heard of that race before...
<Octavia> 13Hmmm... graphic designing...
<RainbowDashCancel> I think the correct show-established term is flank
<SixSpeed> You know, I have zero idea.
<mexican> hmmm
<Octavia> 13Whats it look like right now?
<Xiagu> Gorge_RR_Martin, idk
<RainbowDashCancel> I dunno where plot came from
<SixSpeed> I think it came from the internet.
<MetalRainbowDash> Human race. People who do more than us.
<GRRM> oh
<mexican> well, i liked cupcakes
<MetalRainbowDash> Well, but we're ponies. We can do whatever we want.
<Xiagu> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/list/plot macro/1 might hold the answer
<MetalRainbowDash> I don't know.
<ValtheJean> well, we could always make a little border image for it
<SuperBrony64> Oh...well...hurray for the humans for doing stuff!
<ValtheJean> like with some Pony gifs and whatnot
<GRRM> well, now it's going to be weird whenever my professor explains to us how to plot things in matlab
<mexican> but im not looking for somethink like that now
<Spin> Gorge: It comes from an old internet meme with anime where you take pictures of things like panty shots and put text saying I watch it for the plot so people began using it the same joke but with MLP
<Keyframe> What about George R.R. Martin?
<MetalRainbowDash> *After Pinkie's Party*
*DeniedExistenceMobile takes off after MirthTinker.
<ValtheJean> I'm not sure how emails imbed those images into the text
<Octavia> 13Val be trying to steal mah ideas... >.>; Grab'em!
<MetalRainbowDash> Nice party, Pinkie. See ya.
<ValtheJean> D:
*MetalRainbowDash goes home.
*ValtheJean runs
<Luna> 07hang on sending you all the old one
<Octavia> 13Haha. XD
<GRRM> that was my other name
*Silvermane 15tries sitting up. "Perhaps i was coming on a bit strong. You just seemed so timid, I couldn't help but try and protect you. However, in this reality, I am with MirthTinker. Now, if you want to talk to her, go right ahead, she normally listens to reason."
<SuperBrony64> Been fun, we should do it again sometime!
<DecapKing> 4you got this DE?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> yep
<mexican> !link fanfic
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/37837
<Keyframe> Uh......
<MetalRainbowDash> Ok now i'm going to bed.
<SixSpeed> From another time.
<MetalRainbowDash> Cya guyz.
<SuperBrony64> Okay, night.
<MetalRainbowDash> Tomorrow at like maybe 11 AM
<VioletVanilla> 6I did some web design first year of Uni, I could probably figure embedding out. . .
<MetalRainbowDash> 'Night everypony.
<SuperBrony64> (PST?)
<MetalRainbowDash> See ya tomorrow!
<DecapKing> 4ok, im going to go get something to numb the pain
<MetalRainbowDash> Been fun.
<GrimGallop> Later
<MetalRainbowDash> CDT.
<^Stargazer> I like that people draw pink mane/tailed Celestia, but if I recall she has pink wings too lol
<Silvermane> 15(inb4 vodka)
<MetalRainbowDash> Central Daylight Time like the time in texas.
<SuperBrony64> Okay then, see ya
*DecapKing 4goes off towards the town hospital
*DeniedExistenceMobile begins to gain on MirthTinker, being a more experienced flier.
<MetalRainbowDash> K bye!
<Octavia> 13I was going to volunteer to perhaps help with the design as well. lol
<GRRM> oh
<ValtheJean> confound these bronies...they drive my email to be stacked with facebook updates
*Fluttershy blinks, then sighs and flies off, landing gracefully on the ground.
<SuperBrony64> (So...we still roleplaying?)
<Keyframe> At the end of ASDF 4 you can see what really happened when Celestia banish Luna to the moon.
<RainbowDashCancel> Yeah so since image #4839 was posted, people jokingly associated plot with horse flanks
<GRRM> oh
*GrimGallop shrugs
<cabbage> wings are always the same color as the main part of the pony
<SixSpeed> oh
<mexican> !link asdf_movie
<GrimGallop> (Brb)
<DerpyBot> Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
<VioletVanilla> 6Dat grass~
<GRRM> but they're cartoon ponies
<Keyframe> GRRM, love your books but you drag your feet and its getting boring.
<SuperBrony64> (K, I guess that's it for roleplaying)
*DecapKing 4starts to come back to the apartment, nearly just as soon as he left it
<Luna> 07u has mail?
<Keyframe> It's like you're killing me slowly
<GRRM> I'm too fat and eat too many lemoncakes Keyframe
<mexican> so no fanfic?
<Keyframe> With this book
<Keyframe> with this book
<SuperBrony64> Well, with that out of the way, who's ready for Season 2?!
<GRRM> another 5 years until Winds of Winter comes out
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<Keyframe> >>
<Silvermane> 15Not saying anything about how interested I would or wouldn't be in you, but it isn't fair to her. (dammit you have no idea how hard it is to turn down f***ing Fluttershy of all ponies)
<VioletVanilla> 6I does has mail!! O:
<DecapKing> 4what kind of fucking hospital closes?
*DeniedExistenceMobile gets within yelling distance of MirthTinker.
<Luna> 07zomg
<Ghosties> 4DONE
<FluffyWuffs> wow FimFiction slooks 120% cooler
<GRRM> and I'll probably die before A Dream of Spring comes out
<ValtheJean> but yeah, I'm thinking border image
<SixSpeed> How the hell does Pinkie Pie's table lamp work it's not plugged in what the heck.
<Luna> 07suddenly GHOSTIES!
<Keyframe> Magic
<SuperBrony64> Ouch, guess no-one...
<roushguy> Pinkie Pie bends reality, remember
<SixSpeed> Oooh right
*DecapKing 4grabs the medical kit from the cabinet
<mexican> batteries?
<roushguy> I mean
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Slow down Mirth!
<ValtheJean> and maybe every block has its own imbedded cube iamge
<ValtheJean> image*
<roushguy> She MOVED that one wipe
<Octavia> 13Ah, okay.
<Keyframe> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<ValtheJean> with different characters as the theme
<SixSpeed> She stole the dying sun of a tiny star system.
<Octavia> 13I want to make it all pretty now. <3
<RainbowDashCancel> Pinkie Pie bends reality
<RainbowDashCancel> and defies all logic and science
<Luna> 07so you all agree it needs love?
<RainbowDashCancel> and maths
<VioletVanilla> 6Hold on, figuring out embeds.
<VioletVanilla> 6Yus!! <3
<MirthTinker> 13I don't know how! *Sniff* Silvermane did this to me damnit!
<ValtheJean> in fact...the boxes could be REALLY easy to make
<mexican> and the 4th wall
<Keyframe> And meth.
<Keyframe> Lots and lots of meth
<SixSpeed> And has inflatable hair.
*Natleyn raises a hand
*Fluttershy pulls her wings to her side with the same slowness, her eyes wet. "I... I understand..."
<ValtheJean> all I'd need is a vector image of each of the mane ponies and I could whip them out lickety split
<Fluttershy> (oh really? that hard? o-o)
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I will get you down, give me a second!
<GrimGallop> Back
<Natleyn> Most ponies are AFK, but OCD requires I check in on all chatrooms I'm in every 10 minutes or so.
<SixSpeed> And forgot to take her meds that one day.
<thunder-colt> !plot
<Efreet> Pinkie Pie is <3
<FluffyWuffs> there is no 4th wall
*DecapKing 4goes into the bathroom
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<Luna> 07DA > vector images :)
<herospirit> (*eats popcorn*)
<DecapKing> 4well this is going to suck
<ValtheJean> I figured as much :P
<mexican> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<Keyframe> So............. Social non violent video games are demonized now.
*Luna giggles
<FluffyWuffs> Pinkie Pie obliterated it
<Keyframe> Video games can't get a break
*MirthTinker 13hits the side of a building with a thud
<RainbowDashCancel> wait wut?
<SixSpeed> How so, Keyframe?
<Keyframe> Pinkie Pie killed virtual polar bears?!
*DeniedExistenceMobile pulls up
<SuperBrony64> Haha, I guess so
<Keyframe> Oh you know
*DecapKing 4operates on himself
<Keyframe> Fox News
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Shit shit shit
<FluffyWuffs> Pinkie Pie did that too
<FluffyWuffs> lol
<RainbowDashCancel> oh
<Keyframe> Nothing new
<Synros> I'm just watching people RP
<SixSpeed> Oop wait a second
<spidersean> !plot
<Awesomeshy> ohai lobby
<RainbowDashCancel> lol
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<GRRM> wow there is no way I can get through my magnetics class without giggling like an idiot whenever they say plot now
<spidersean> :3
*DecapKing 4comes back out of the bathroom
<Silvermane> 15Please don't cry Fluttershy. I don't like seeing any filly cry, especially not you.
<SuperBrony64> But yeah, who here has been with My Little Pony since G1?!
*MirthTinker 13slides down the wall, motionless
<FluffyWuffs> You probably don't know this. But PINKIE PIE IS ALSO BEHIND YOU!
<Silvermane> 15(oooo that's gotta hurt)
<roushguy> I can only imagine what would happen if someone made a crossover with Deadpool and Pinkamena Pie
<SixSpeed> Fox News isn't a credited source for anything, so.
*DeniedExistenceMobile flys down to catch MirthTinker
<LunaOnTheMoon> !link plot
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/13188
<Keyframe> Which is why
<DecapKing> 4god thats much better
<SuperBrony64> XD
<Keyframe> I laugh at their paranoia
<ValtheJean> alright, gimme some time while I crank something out really fast
<RainbowDashCancel> Yeah, it's the beginning of the month, and Fox News needs something to prevent their audience from staring at a blank screen
<ReticentSmolder> 5eeeyup, just another night on SS...
<roushguy> Not PINKIE
<roushguy> But Pinkamena
*Fluttershy turns to look at Silvermane with her wide, sad eyes, lip trembling. "I... I should probably never come back, should I...?"
*ValtheJean scrounges for his tablet
*DecapKing 4jumps back at the sight of Fluttershy
*DeniedExistenceMobile grabs onto her, then begins to slowly lower her to the ground.
<RainbowDashCancel> so they hate on a video game because it's easy to blame
<SixSpeed> Fox News isn't a credited source for papers in most classes at my school.
<Keyframe> I remember when they talked about Bronies
<herospirit> Super Brony.... wat.
<roushguy> Pinkamena's crazy enough to kill people with Deadpool.
<Natleyn> nope.jpg
*DecapKing 4hides from the yellow pegasus
<RainbowDashCancel> and then yellow their journalism more than Fluttershy's flank
<SuperBrony64> I would assume some people would be out there like "I've liked MLP as a guy before they were cool"
<SixSpeed> YOU HEARD THE LADY. SHE AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERES, CHUMP.
*Octavia 13is also working on her own version
<ReticentSmolder> 5(btw Fluttershy, we can use colours in here, so feel free to use whatever you like so long as its visible :P)
*VioletVanilla is working on some too
<Efreet> I don't see why Pinkamena is classed as a killer :I.. She's crazy, but not psychotic.
<Natleyn> I'd watch an episode or two, but only when I was desperate enough that the plot (and I mean the storyline) seemed interesting
*HaysforPonies remembers the whole Mass Effect debacle and how you don't have to investigate anything to jump to conclusions.
<ValtheJean> DON'T CHOO BE TOUCHIN MAH APPLEJACK
<Efreet> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE!
<VioletVanilla> 6Well. . . Not vector or whatever. . .
<thunder-colt> Who you callin' chump, chump?
<Octavia> 13;)
<Silvermane> 15Fluttershy, I wouldn't be your friend if I ever wanted you to leave. You're still my Shy-Shy.
<Fluttershy> 9(oki)
<Keyframe> Superman, Superman... Shh..... You hear that? Do you hear the Justice League?
<VioletVanilla> 6DON'T CHOO USE YER FANCY MATHEMATICS TO MUDDY THE ISSUE!
<mexican> i wish i were RD there
<Silvermane> 15(that works)
<RainbowDashCancel> HaysforPonies ah, yes. that.
<Natleyn> I didn't have much against it aside from finding it boring.
<Keyframe> Jack Thompson
<ReticentSmolder> 8YELLOW IS MIEN HAHAHAOOOOOHOOOHA
<SuperBrony64> I wouldn't even bother with it
<Dee> I feel happy today, my Mother is now a fan of MLP within only a 15 minute snippet of the show.. she craves for more
<SixSpeed> Also, Pinkie's shoulders move.
<RainbowDashCancel> HaysforPonies the Mass Effect thing blown out of proportion. That one.
<DecapKing> 4uh, sorry for interrupting, but is she going to kick me again?
<SuperBrony64> I can't stand it
<Keyframe> I can only love and tolerate so much
<Silvermane> 15... >.>
<SixSpeed> Just all over the place.
<ReticentSmolder> 5okay, not really
<Natleyn> Oh and the toys
<Natleyn> BY GOD THOSE TOYS
*Natleyn shudders
<SuperBrony64> No Faust-Awesome-Spray, no deal
*Fluttershy 9sniffles. "B-but that implies that I'm yours... and... I'm not..."
<stratguy> i wonder how much streaming this ipod can take
<herospirit> 14I am the dark gray of not actually being part of the story.
<HaysforPonies> Bioware should troll everyone on ME3 and have highly detailed sex. I noticed they toned it down suddenly in ME2.
<mexican> dat plot
*DeniedExistenceMobile reachs the ground with MirthTinker in tow.
*herospirit 14absconds
<ValtheJean> STUPID INTARWEBZ
<Efreet> http://www.boardgame-online.com/g/game.php?g=kJX somepony should come and play :V
<SuperBrony64> Uhhh...until the battery dies? >.>
<Keyframe> Yea cuz zipper humping....
<ValtheJean> How can I work without my music playing FLUIDLY!
<Keyframe> >>
<Keyframe> I"m just going to leave it at that
<Efreet> brb though.
*MirthTinker 13is limp, but breathing, albeit heavily from pain and overexertion
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ...
<FluffyWuffs> HIYA HaysforPonies
<roushguy> oooohh
<Spin> Efreet?
<RainbowDashCancel> Years later, Fox News hates on Bulletstorm for its immaturity, but is unaware of Shadows of the Damned which contains some same immaturity
*Silvermane 15sighs. "Right, right... look, umm... oh dear."
<SuperBrony64> The toys today are still a problem
<roushguy> Darnit
<roushguy> I got rr'd
<FluffyWuffs> FOX5 news=fail
<FluffyWuffs> nuff said
<HaysforPonies> Selective outrage is a thing.
<SuperBrony64> Gotta remember the studio that makes this show is a TOY COMPANY
<Keyframe> I know an animator at EA.
<Dee> neat
<SuperBrony64> They wanna sell TOYS
<RainbowDashCancel> and doesn't know about Dragon Age II, where you can have a bisexual threesome with a elf and a swashbuckling pirate hooker
<mexican> im in the game
<FluffyWuffs> lolwut
<SixSpeed> Hah.
<FluffyWuffs> o.O
<Keyframe> I know right? I kept sending him emails saying "Don't fuck up Mass Effect" as a joke
*DecapKing 4pulls out his combat knife with a shaking hoof
*DeniedExistenceMobile takes out his flask and pours a little down MirthTinker's throat.
<Spin> Wow equestria is a country lol
<SuperBrony64> Even if it goes as far as making Princess Celestia's coat pink instead of white
<Dee> I love Bulletstorm, i have a Grayson Hunt figurine right next to me
<FreezeFrame> That was due to TRU, not due to Hasbro
<Keyframe> It's sooo hot.... -_-
<Natleyn> Today's toys are okay.
<SuperBrony64> They really fucked that one up good lol
*MirthTinker 13coughs instinctively, but makes no other movement
*DeniedExistenceMobile takes some bandages from his saddlebags.
*Fluttershy 9whimpers, then lowers her head. "I don't know what to think anymore..."
<FluffyWuffs> Haven't played bulletstorm. But that kicking animation looks pretty sick
<FreezeFrame> Apparently, Toys 'R Us doesn't think White Celestia will sell
<SixSpeed> Keyframe, tell him "Don't fuck up BF3. Remember MoH."
<SuperBrony64> I don't think TruTV had a say in the matter...
<mexican> next episode is "the best night ever":
<SuperBrony64> >_<
<FreezeFrame> No, Toys R Us
<mexican> !link http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<FreezeFrame> :P
*Silvermane 15crawls over the bed and brings himself near Fluttershy. He looks over her carefully, concern in his eyes.
<RainbowDashCancel> they also totally forgot about Duke Nukem Forever, which contains actual nudity, and came out a few months later
<Efreet> anypony else joining? if not, I'm gonna start the game up now.
*Keyframe feels his laptop. "Oh that's why."
<Natleyn> Before, I feel I could find more than a few people that found G1 toys some kind of nightmare_fuel.
<ReticentSmolder> 5So Fluttershy, have you guessed my doppelganger yet?
*DeniedExistenceMobile begins wrapping MirthTinker's bruises and cuts in bandage.
<SuperBrony64> They are
<Keyframe> Nope its 10:30 I'm actually going to get some sleep. Gotta take pills tomorrow since the Doc didn't know what was wrong with me :D
<FreezeFrame> I would totally buy a show-accurate set of Mane 6 + Princesses
<SuperBrony64> Remember, there was a time when MLP was something used a stereotypical staple for girls
*Fluttershy 9shrinks a little lower to the ground, but looks over her shoulder at Silvermane, biting her lip.
<FluffyWuffs> I threw money at my screen for duke nukem, only to find that my screen was rejecting it for a reason
<FluffyWuffs> a pretty good waste
<Natleyn> Dude
<Natleyn> GIRLS thought it was nightmare_fuel
<Keyframe> Uh... yea. Night all
<FluffyWuffs> if you're going to play it. I'd advice piratin git
<FluffyWuffs> gnight frame
<Silvermane> 15Fluttershy... i still love you. But I'm IN love with MirthTinker. It's difficult, I know, but that's how it is. I'm sorry... (doing my best not to mention Tinker's penchant for random 3somes...)
<SuperBrony64> Haha, not younger girls
*DeniedExistenceMobile finishes bandaging MirthTinker. Then lays her over his back.
<RainbowDashCancel> But you were in your room when you threw the money right?
<DecapKing> 4Silver, i would watch out around her
<RainbowDashCancel> Not at someone else's house
<DecapKing> 4she kicks HARD
<SixSpeed> The latest letdown in my life is the new Dream Theater album
<Fluttershy> 9oh dear.. 3somes... =_=; )
<MirthTinker> 13(it was just the once, and she was brainwashed!)
<Natleyn> Nobody I knew ever bought them... >.>
<RobotPinkie> morning, brownies
<RainbowDashCancel> and of course the screen would reject it
<SuperBrony64> But come on, how many times have people poked at girls using references like My Little Pony or Barbie?!
*DeniedExistenceMobile begins walking back towards the house.
<FluffyWuffs> in my room
<ValtheJean> okay, I have a REALLY rough draft
<Silvermane> 15(Tinker was the brainwasher in that story...)
<DecapKing> 4also
<FluffyWuffs> psh, normaly my screen doesn't :D
<ValtheJean> uploading it to photobucket now
<herospirit> 14(So you say Tinker, so you say)
<Natleyn> They'd get princesses or barbies.
<FluffyWuffs> it usually makes good choices
<DecapKing> 4please dont kick me again Fluttershy
*herospirit 14absconds
<SuperBrony64> Evening...and brownies are food...
<FluffyWuffs> I'm loving dead island
<Stomper> hi
<SixSpeed> Oh fuck yes
<RobotPinkie> Indeed they are.
<Natleyn> Hiya RobotPinkie
<FluffyWuffs> althought the release wasn't as intended
*Fluttershy 9shakes her head suddenly, shuddering. "I can't believe you... you made me think that you loved me like that when you didn't!"
<FluffyWuffs> they released the alpha pack
<SuperBrony64> Damn, walked into that one
<RainbowDashCancel> There'sa scene in the beginning where Duke Nukem is "having fun" with parodies of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen
<RobotPinkie> hay Natleyn
<SuperBrony64> *facehoof*
<SixSpeed> My friend and I are raping through Dead Island.
<HaysforPonies> Yeah I heard that oopsie
*MirthTinker 13is still unconscious, lying on DE's back and breathing erratically
<GrimGallop> Lol
<RainbowDashCancel> but they're animated and drawn to look like teenagers
<FluffyWuffs> what level are ya Six?
<GrimGallop> Ahoy
<RainbowDashCancel> sicko Duke
<SixSpeed> Uh
<SixSpeed> 34.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Hate not being able to fly...
<RainbowDashCancel> chasing underage girls
<FluffyWuffs> o.O
<FluffyWuffs> dang...
<SixSpeed> Yeah
<FluffyWuffs> I just got to level 21 D:
<stratguy> yar
<SixSpeed> We kinda played it for two days straight.
*Silvermane 15hangs his head, wings drooping at his sides. "And I'm sorry for that. I didn't intend to mislead you."
<ValtheJean> okay
<RobotPinkie> hay SuperBrony64, GrimGallop, and so on... man, it's gonna be a rough day
<FluffyWuffs> lol
<SixSpeed> Like
<ValtheJean> so obviously not all the lines are removed and whatnot
<ValtheJean> but this is the general idea
<SixSpeed> Straight.
*DecapKing 4looks out of the open door and sees DE with a knocked out MirthTinker on his back
*DeniedExistenceMobile continues the trek back.
<ValtheJean> we can clump every subject into these colored boxes
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/Temp.jpg
<FluffyWuffs> for 48 hours!?
<SuperBrony64> Is it now?
<GrimGallop> Pfft, you're a robot.
<SixSpeed> We slept.
<FluffyWuffs> XD
<Luna> 07ohai AJ!
<ValtheJean> :P
*RainbowDashCancel does not know what Dead Island is. Bings it.
<Luna> 07the poor pony is blind :(
<FluffyWuffs> Go on steam
<SixSpeed> >2011
<FluffyWuffs> and buy it
<SixSpeed> >using Bing
<FluffyWuffs> and kick zombies in the face!
<DecapKing> 4oh hell....
*Fluttershy 9suddenly bursts out into sobs, putting her face into her hoofs. "I'm so angry with you but I... I can't... ahhh!"
<ValtheJean> well I could put the eyes back
<stratguy> mabey only half robot
<SixSpeed> How does the combat system work on PC?
<ValtheJean> just I figured the full image would draw too much attention
<FluffyWuffs> I'd assume it's the same as the console systems
<GrimGallop> Either way, with Pinkie it's just party all day and dance all night...
<FluffyWuffs> you mean with keyboard and mosue?
<FluffyWuffs> mouse*
<SixSpeed> With digital/analog fighting options?
<RobotPinkie> Well, maybe after classes...
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, might I be as bold to inquire why it will be a rough day?
<FluffyWuffs> yeah
<SixSpeed> Interesting
<ValtheJean> thoughts?
<FluffyWuffs> it's not that bad
*DecapKing 4drops to the floor when he hears the crying
*Silvermane 15grimaces. "If it will make you feel better, do it. Don't worry about consequences or me or Tinker, just release your anger. Right here, right now. It's probably better than holding it..."
<SixSpeed> It got to the point that using analog was just too slow.
<RobotPinkie> Eh, kinda still have a cold, but I can't afford to miss another class
<DecapKing> 4wait, what?
<FluffyWuffs> hey HotCocoa
<PsychicKid> How many creatures should a typical MTG deck have
<Ghosties> 4Finished "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" for the first time. It's been a long time coming
*Silvermane 15wonders to himself 'I bet Shadow would be proud of me right about now... fucking bastard'
<SixSpeed> Later in the 20s.
<HotCocoa> Hey
<FluffyWuffs> got any marshmellows :3?
<stratguy> that sucks
<RainbowDashCancel> Eh, it was legitimately released two days ago
<PsychicKid> cuz I'm running a lot of burn cards
<RainbowDashCancel> Dead Island
<VioletVanilla> 6DDDDD: AAAAAAHHHH!!!
<RainbowDashCancel> Don't necessarily have to buy it from Steam
<FluffyWuffs> lol
<RobotPinkie> Could be worse, thoug.
<Spose> The great and powerful Derpy!
<FluffyWuffs> yeah on steam, it was out on the 6th
<stratguy> yep
*DeniedExistenceMobile reaches the door, now sweating.
<SuperBrony64> Yeah, it could rain
<GrimGallop> Could be food poisoning. Try going to classes with that~
*Fluttershy 9trembles, shaking her head and leaning down, curling up into a ball.
<CureZen> Hello.
<SuperBrony64> Then you'd be ****ed
<FluffyWuffs> hiya
<RobotPinkie> Exactly!
<Spose> That drawfriend had some cool stuff.
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, I wish there would be a MLP game...
<SuperBrony64> BUT
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Ah...fuck...who locked this thing?
<HaysforPonies> ScratchSweater is daaaaw
<herospirit> 14(got to go)
<SuperBrony64> As a Kart racer...that way I know it couldn't suck that bad
<FluffyWuffs> pft, Vinyl in a Tux
<herospirit> 14(Cya later)
<stratguy> well there is silent pony ville
<Blums> Scratch hoodie?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Bye)
<Silvermane> 15(bye herospirit)
*DecapKing 4starts to run towards teh door
<SuperBrony64> Oh wow, that sounds interesting
<GrimGallop> :O?
<Spose> This drawfriend helped me realize that...that...Luna is not best pony.
<stratguy> but its beta
<RainbowDashCancel> I used to use Steam way back in the days of Half Life 2, before I got seriously into PC gaming
<herospirit> Night everypony!
<TrollightSparkle> My bronies, I have come to the conclusion that Steven Seagal is a total badass.
<Spose> Vinyl is.
<ValtheJean> but yeah
<RobotPinkie> There's a bunch in development by fans.
<SuperBrony64> There's also the SMB2 sprite hack
<MirthTinker> 13(just had 120V worth of pool circuitry run through her arm and back into the circuit. I'm freaking out, but fine)
<ValtheJean> if the image distracts too much from the text
<RobotPinkie> night herospirit
<FluffyWuffs> You mispelled Twilight
<GrimGallop> Later
<ValtheJean> we can even add a semi transparent white layer to it
<TrollightSparkle> Night herospirit
<VioletVanilla> 6D'awwwww :c
<herospirit> May your dreams be filled with Pony!
<ValtheJean> making the text stand out
*Silvermane 15crawls off the bed over to Fluttershy. He lays down next to her, using a wing to hug her. "i'm so sorry..."
<SuperBrony64> How long did it take to reach that conclusion?
<thunder-colt> You both mispelled Spitfire.
<Fluttershy> 9sounds... fun o-o; )
<^Stargazer> I used to use Gamespy back in the day to look up Quake and Quake Team Fortress servers lol
<SuperBrony64> Night hero
*DecapKing 4opens the door only to run into a DE and a passed out MirthTinker
<Blums> Poor colgate has a nosebleed though
<RobotPinkie> oh they were filled with pony
<HaysforPonies> WE ALL MISSPELLED FLUTTERSHY EXCUSE ME
<TrollightSparkle> Oh, just 30 minutes of Under Siege 2 :P
<thunder-colt> AHEM
<Silvermane> 15MirthTinker, did it enter your chest cavity/
<DecapKing> 4holy shit! what happened?
<ValtheJean> so is this agreeable with everyone?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Watch it man!
<HaysforPonies> Harumph.
<Spose> DJ PON-3 beats all.
<^Stargazer> those were the days
<stratguy> iv'e also heard of a mlp street fighter kind of thing but im not to sure
<SuperBrony64> It took until the sequel?!
<thunder-colt> I REJECT YOUR PONIES AND SUBSTITUTE MY OWN.
<SuperBrony64> How could you??
<RainbowDashCancel> If I logged on to a Steam account now, I'd probably get banned for all my pirated stuff.
<TrollightSparkle> I've only seen the sequel lol
<RobotPinkie> lol Under Siege is really quite badass
<Natleyn> Noesssss
<roushguy> Fluttershy. She's my favorite
<Natleyn> I missed hero ;~;
<DeniedExistenceMobile> A wall attacked her.
<FluffyWuffs> GUYS
<Spose> They haven't found mine, and I have some of them on my steam libary.
*Natleyn hugs herospirit goodbye
<FluffyWuffs> I AM THE BEST PONY
<SixSpeed> Alright pones. Time for bed.
<Spose> *coughs*
<Spose> Night six.
<FluffyWuffs> night six
<Nashy> http://127.0.0.1/randomship.php <- things are progressing :P
<SixSpeed> FLUFFY IS MY FAVORITE PONY
<HaysforPonies> I laughed too hard at #11. Gilda looks like Tweety.
<DecapKing> 4well Silvermane is in there telling that kicking machine to release her anger
<JackiePie> !link http://img.ponibooru.org/images/33/33e882d23b25401bc4689ee6d1ee6d85
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Now stop standing around and help me!
<DerpyBot> Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
<Silvermane> 15(those dammed orphanages )
<FluffyWuffs> :D
<SuperBrony64> Is he still here?
<Nashy> damn wrong IP
*Fluttershy 9looks at Silvermane from the corner of her eyes, then looks back at nothing, giving him the silent treatment.
<TrollightSparkle> No, he's gone.
<DecapKing> 4and im not getting kicked by her again man!
<Natleyn> Nope. u.u
<Luna> 07show me
<JackiePie> It is poniooru Derpy
<Nashy> http://81.234.225.23/randomship.php D:
<JackiePie> booru
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, I'm going to be honest now...
<DecapKing> 4fine
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Goddamn it.
<stratguy> k
<RainbowDashCancel> Derpy's only familiar with ponibooru on 413chan
<SuperBrony64> I've never seen a single episode of MLP
<RainbowDashCancel> not ponibooru.org
<FluffyWuffs> nice pc ip there Nashy XD
<GrimGallop> What.
<TrollightSparkle> Blasphemy.
<JackiePie> Ah well, I was going to say my special talent also is popping plastic bubbles
*DecapKing 4takes the passed out MirthTinker onto his back
<RobotPinkie> I prefer Jean Claude Van Damme to Steven Seagal....
<Nashy> Yeah I use localhost to test D;
<SuperBrony64> Is it a cool show?
<RobotPinkie> so many ridiculous movies
<TrollightSparkle> Go on YouTube and watch Episode 1 NAO. Celestia commands you.
<Spose> That'd be an awesome writing contest.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Find her a couch or something.
<Octavia> 13I'm still working on my own. :P
<DecapKing> 4just make sure she doesnt fall off
<SuperBrony64> Celestia? Is that one of the ponies?
<stratguy> i hav no clue who those huys r
<TrollightSparkle> But seriously, it is a good show.
<RobotPinkie> lol you best be jokin', neigha
<Spose> Use the generator, write a fic for whatever pair comes up.
<thunder-colt> Applestar. Odd ship.
*Silvermane 15simply lies there, content to wait and mull over his ill luck and choices. 'Aeeyup, fucking Shadowmane would be patting me on the back right about now... I need to buck him in the jaw next time I see him.'
<SuperBrony64> Imma trollin' :P
<GrimGallop> He has to be trolling.
<GrimGallop> XD
<HaysforPonies> I got Inkity.
<SuperBrony64> WOAH
<FluffyWuffs> time for bed
<SuperBrony64> You must be psychic
*DeniedExistenceMobile walks into the room with Fluttershy and Silvermane.
<FluffyWuffs> good night everypony
<Natleyn> RobotPinkie, I love you for that
<thunder-colt> gnight
*DecapKing 4walks inside of the apartment and sets the passed out MirthTinker onto Silvermane's bed
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ....
<SuperBrony64> icwatudidthar
<RobotPinkie> for what? :P
<MirthTinker> 13ummmmm, well it made my heart skip a beat
<MirthTinker> 13probably
*Fluttershy 9looks up at the sudden interruption, then quickly stands up and backs away into the corner.
<RainbowDashCancel> Wow, I got Dr. Whooves x DJ-PON3
<Natleyn> >neigha
<Natleyn> It's been a while since I cracked up like that
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ....?
<RobotPinkie> It's a good word, mos def.
<Silvermane> 15(mfw the reality of what my apartment looks like is broken repeatedly )
<MirthTinker> 13it gave me quite a scare, but I'm pretty sure I'm alright
<thunder-colt> So this is what I decided to put in my 'guess me' bag for school
<thunder-colt> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15497387/Camera/DSCF5506.JPG
<HaysforPonies> Am I the only one that likes Scratch without the glasses? I like her red eyes.
<GrimGallop> I started watching it about four days ago and finished it yesterday, after noticing that threads have sprung up about it on every forum I have bookmarked.
<RainbowDashCancel> If I was going to write a ship about it, I wouldn't know what to do
<DecapKing> 4(i know right?)
<ValtheJean> here's with the white layer:
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/Test2.jpg
<thunder-colt> Hays, I like her eyes too
<RobotPinkie> Oh, welcome to the herd, then!
<SuperBrony64> I started jigging with it since...last week?
<Silvermane> 15(so... where is everypony in relation to each other? )
<RainbowDashCancel> Did we confirm that DJ has red eyes or was than fanonized?
<GrimGallop> :D
<HaysforPonies> Fanon.
<DecapKing> 4(im at the side of your bed)
<stratguy> ima brb and stuff
<SuperBrony64> Pretty much taught myself everything about MLP since then
<MirthTinker> 13(I'm on DE's back, just coming into the commons room downstairs
<Luna> 07Nice idea would you rotate with all mane 6 or?
<Fluttershy> 9I think we're now all in your bedroom. o-o MirthTinker is on the bed, passed out, and DecapKing and DeniedExistenceMobile are simply standing there. I'm backed into a corner and you're awkwardly standing there.)
<ValtheJean> pretty much, yeah
<VioletVanilla> 6I do like~
<SuperBrony64> At least with G4
<ValtheJean> so then we use different boxes with each subject in the newsletter
<Natleyn> I meant to watch it back in November, but I just went home and played minecraft.
<HaysforPonies> It makes her more like Dave from Homestuck. Use of turntables, cool glasses and red eyes.
<GRRM> there's a DJ?
<SuperBrony64> God forbid I see another episode of G3.5 or less
<MirthTinker> 13fyi, Silver lives in a 2 floor flat/apartment complex with rooms acessible from a hallway on the second floor)
<JackiePie> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/202/8/4/fluttershy_meets_mameshiba_by_toonfreak-d418p6a.png
<RobotPinkie> Great time to become a brony, I reckon, what with Season 2 starting up in a week.
<thunder-colt> DJ PON-3, yes
<Silvermane> 15and my room is simply that. a room.
<JackiePie> lol Fluttershy discovers a horrible truth
<Natleyn> When I got back to college, everyone was brony, so I watched there
<SuperBrony64> Yeah lol
<Luna> 07I say to the forums with all idea's
<GRRM> oh like deadmau5
<GrimGallop> Indeed
<GRRM> I get it
<VioletVanilla> 6And we could have the boxes not just vertical, but maybe have them like top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right.
<Luna> 07Even the DA idea should be posted there
<DecapKing> 4(im not just standing there, im standing here scared of being kicked)
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (All I said was I walked in)
<SuperBrony64> I didn't have to hide in a corner in the feetal position for a few months till Season 2
<MirthTinker> 13well, its nice, in a Spartan sort of way
<RainbowDashCancel> There was a post on ED showing a Octavia x DJ-PON3 art
<TrollightSparkle> I hope I'll find a couple of bronies at college.. I probably won't knowing my luck x.x
<ValtheJean> to the clou-...I mean threads!
<Ghosties> 4Whatever it is you guys are talking about, make sure you add it to the Affairs page
<RainbowDashCancel> it was a small comic about them arguing their musical tastes
<Fluttershy> 9fun times )
<SuperBrony64> I watched them all and now Season 2 comes in 9 days :D
<thunder-colt> angry secks one?
<Silvermane> 15covered in old vests on the floor of course....
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (I am wherever you are Silvermane
<RainbowDashCancel> and at the end they end up shipping
<RainbowDashCancel> yeah
<thunder-colt> lols
<thunder-colt> i liked that one
<Silvermane> 15alright, we are all in my room apparently. joy...
<SuperBrony64> You won't unless you introduce some bait
<GRRM> how does one have angry sex?
<HaysforPonies> The hell....there is no badass pic of Dave Strider and Vinyl Scratch together.
<DecapKing> 4(i'm also checking on MirthTinker)
<Natleyn> BAIT.
<HaysforPonies> This has to happen.
<SuperBrony64> I'm in college and I wouldn't DARE go open-closet
<RainbowDashCancel> I don't think that comic would've had the same angry effect if DJ didn't have her glasses
<Natleyn> Bait that people who don't watch won't realize.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Deck the halls I guess...)
<Silvermane> 15alright, everypony out. I need to talk to these two alone for a bit.
<SuperBrony64> That was, unless someone started playing an episode with speakers on
<Natleyn> Like Celestia's Sunburst cutie mark or something.
<ValtheJean> will do Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4Alright, I'm checking out tonight. I'll catch you guys later. Glad the test stream went (relatively) smooth :)
<DecapKing> 4fine
<ReticentSmolder> 5I'm in my own room, across the hall, no idea why its so loud in Silvermane's room but knowing better than to ask)
<Silvermane> 15Thanks for finding Tink for me though
<ValtheJean> gnight Ghosties, sleep well
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Yeah sure
<Luna> 07night Ghosties, sweet dreams
*DecapKing 4starts to leave
<ReticentSmolder> 5also, damnit, nopony reads what I type
<RainbowDashCancel> GRRM, Hamlet and his mom had angry/mournful sex in Hamlet
<ValtheJean> I'll make two individual threads: one for the newsletter images, the other for the DA games
<SuperBrony64> That would be...obsessive
<DeniedExistenceMobile> She got into a fight with a wall though
<GrimGallop> One of my friends made a post on facebook saying he was getting strange looks at the college while listening to pony swag :P
<RobotPinkie> Haha, well I guess it depends o what kind of school you're in.
<thunder-colt> i dont remember that
<RainbowDashCancel> but they didn't take their clothes off or anything
<GRRM> Hamlet?
<ValtheJean> does that sparkle with everyone? (please please PLEASE get the reference)
*DecapKing 4goes and knocks on ReticentSmolder's door
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodnight Ghosties! :3
<GRRM> wait
<Silvermane> 15(lol oh you... silly Smolder, talking is for shippers ;) )
<Luna> 07don't catch up on my post count :P
<ReticentSmolder> 7YOU'RE GOING TO *READ* ME
<thunder-colt> you've never..?
<Luna> 07:D
<TrollightSparkle> A school filled with geeks and technophiles :o
<GRRM> the one where he takes revenge on his uncle?
<RobotPinkie> I have Twilight Sparkle as a good luck charm on my desk.

*ReticentSmolder 7opens door. "Hello? Do I know you?"
<RainbowDashCancel> okay, it might've been an exaggeration displayed in the Mel Gibson film, but scholars stated that Hamlet (character analysis) had an oedipus complex for his mother
<Silvermane> 15mfw LUNA
<TrollightSparkle> Aw DAMNIT WHY'D YA HAVE TO GO AND DO THAT GRIM??

<ValtheJean> okay, threads are up
<TrollightSparkle> It's magic, I ain't gotta explain s***
<thunder-colt> BEEEYATCH
<ReticentSmolder> 7I like how almost everypony in here is involved in this one, some of us doing two parts 0.0 bet you still can't guess who I double as
<GRRM> why the moon?
<RainbowDashCancel> Yeah, if you get there, to the moon,
<SuperBrony64> Wizards...magic...self-explanatory
<RainbowDashCancel> Don't forget to pick up Monster Carrot
<RobotPinkie> Poor Luna :(
<RainbowDashCancel> Goku dropped him there and forgot about him
*Silvermane 15likes how RS didn't use ()
<Synros> aare you a wizard?!
<TrollightSparkle> Yeah..
<DecapKing> 4(MirthTinker?)
<SuperBrony64> Luna feels like a loner
<RobotPinkie> lol
<ReticentSmolder> 7its implied, I'm rarely in the canon
<thunder-colt> GRRM: referring to this animation http://skaijo.deviantart.com/art/Friendship-Is-Magic-Bitch-251799262
<Silvermane> 15heh
<GrimGallop> Everyone knows that all wizards have monocles.
*Fluttershy 9lowers her head. "Oh... I never had a chance, did I?"
*ReticentSmolder 7(knows DecapKing totally did a whois)
<Silvermane> 15(ouch. ouch ouch ouch. that one hurts IRL)
<DecapKing> 4(nope)
<DecapKing> 4(lucky guess)
<Fluttershy> 9What does? o-o )
<Silvermane> 15(your line. ouch)
*DeniedExistenceMobile loots a piece of cake from the fridge! +2 to scavenging!
<Fluttershy> 9Sorry. ^^; )
<GrimGallop> How do I like videos like that? Just paste the link?

<SuperBrony64> Yeah
<SuperBrony64> Err..I mean
<Pizzicato> Derp.
<SuperBrony64> Eeyup
<Fluttershy> 9I guess I have a thing for drama you can say. Though not necessarily in the way you'd think... )
<Natleyn> Filly's don't know 'bout dat IRC
<GRRM> man
<Pizzicato> I haven't played TF2 in like a week.

<Natleyn> ./sadness
<GRRM> it didn't even load for me
<Somepony> TF2?
<SuperBrony64> I don't think Arthur likes the show...
<Pizzicato> Yeah.
<Pizzicato> TF2.
*Silvermane 15sighs. "I can't answer that. So much i can't say for simple fairness. I'm sorry."
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, just link... it'll show up without a thumbnail for you, though
<Somepony> Oh yeah.
<Fluttershy> 9I don't believe in behaving dramatically, but I'm good at tweaking situations to create high emotional impacts. )
<GrimGallop> Shiny
<Silvermane> 15(you are a thespian )
<GrimGallop> I totally want this game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrlzkKa6O8
<Fluttershy> 9XP thanks I think )
<Synros> well its time for me to head out for work

<Somepony> Tf2, is like awesome.
<GrimGallop> Later
<Synros> soo... I'll be back in in like an hour.
<Natleyn> Bye Synros :3
<Silvermane> 15(lol)
*DeniedExistenceMobile encounters a fridge monster while scavenging!
<DecapKing> 4well thanks for the booze
<SuperBrony64> Later Synros
<Somepony> All it needs is pony models
<SuperBrony64> But why do you work at 9 PM?
<ReticentSmolder> 7Silvermane...that was some serious herdmind
<SuperBrony64> >.>
<RainbowDashCancel> I've never played Team Fortress 2 ever.
*DeniedExistenceMobile attacks the fridge monster for 6 damage!
<Synros> thats the joy of graveyards, I get paid for doing nothing
<DecapKing> 4i think im going to go and check on Silver across the hall
*Fluttershy 9pauses, then slowly looks up with Silvermane, confusion and a slight spark of hope in her eyes. "Wait... are you saying... there is a slight chance that you and I...? I mean..." Fluttershy bit her lip. "Is there?"
<ReticentSmolder> 7also Decap, what gave it away?
<Somepony> Play it. Do it.
*CogWeaver has never played TF2 ever either*
<Pizzicato> It's free.
<Pizzicato> No excuses.
<VioletVanilla> 6Natleyn, PM please~
<ValtheJean> and just finished making the update thread, so Ghosties may rest easy now :P
<Somepony> yes.
*DeniedExistenceMobile is hit for 2 damage by the fridge monster!
<RainbowDashCancel> Free free?
<Somepony> I don't even know why it is though.
<DecapKing> 4(you and Mirth would join at roughly the same time)
<RainbowDashCancel> like not trial Free
<Somepony> No.
<GrimGallop> A graveyard, you say? :D
<Synros> watching movies, and going on the internet
<Somepony> Its FTP
<RainbowDashCancel> (looks at WoW)
<Somepony> Free to play.
<RobotPinkie> wtf, Doctor Who just turned into Batman, or something...
<ReticentSmolder> 7(well that one's kinda obvious, but Fluttershy wasn't here for that :P)
<Pizzicato> Free to play FOREVER
<Synros> ok cya in a buit
<ValtheJean> post* not thread
<Synros> bit*
<Pizzicato> You can 'find' items as you play it, or you can buy them.
<SuperBrony64> Haha I get it
<Pizzicato> But the items ARE NOT gamebreakers.
<Fluttershy> 9Huh? What does this have to do with me? o-o )
<SuperBrony64> Wait a min...
<Pizzicato> They will not overpower you.
<Somepony> No.
*Silvermane 15looks away from Fluttershy, pain in his eyes. "I can't answer that." Sighing, he walks over to his desk and opens a drawer.
<Pizzicato> They all come with a benefit and a setback.
<Synros> me?
*DecapKing 4leaves the apartment and goes into the apartment across the hall
<SuperBrony64> Nah, you can leave now
*MirthTinker 13is still unconcious, lying on the bed now and breathing heavily, but regularly now
<Somepony> Hats is what I am looking at.
<SuperBrony64> I give you permission
<Synros> oh ouch
<Pizzicato> Yeah, you can buy hats.
<GrimGallop> lol
<Somepony> Need monies for hats.
*DeniedExistenceMobile attacks the fridge monster for 12 damage! *CriticalHit* The beast is felled!
<Silvermane> 15(don't worry about it. ReticentSmolder is running two characters and wonders if you know who the second is)
<ReticentSmolder> 7oh, I was just wondering if you knew who my double is :P
<Fluttershy> 9Loffly. )
<SuperBrony64> I love this animation: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/576522
<thunder-colt> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, thunder-colt!
<thunder-colt> dreaming of poniessssss
<SuperBrony64> Best thing I've seen in a while
*Luna likes this night theme too
<Pizzicato> Man I never dream about ponies.
<Luna> 07again the 3 ladies and another guy
<roushguy> I do
<Luna> 07theme = team*
*GrimGallop clicks
<RobotPinkie> lol oh yeah
<Somepony> Me to.
<Luna> 07I'm tired... 5:57 am
*Silvermane 15rummages around in his drawer for a moment, bringing out a small tin. He sets it on the desk and opens it up.
*GrimGallop goes AFK while it loads
*Fluttershy 9watches Silvermane silently, her expression unreadable. After a moment she glances over at MirthTinker on the bed, then slowly trots over. "I DID do this... didn't I? She flew out in a panic because of me..."
<ReticentSmolder> 7also Decap, what? you don't want to stay for more? I've got Sebralan Whiskey too
*DecapKing 4walks into the apartment to a field of tension
<Pizzicato> I seldom remember my dreams.
<RainbowDashCancel> Wait, but won't Steam detect my pirated games and ban my account?
<Pizzicato> But when I do they're really awful.
<roushguy> I dreamt about Pinkie, mainly
<Pizzicato> No.
<ValtheJean> lol, we wub woo woona
<Pizzicato> Unless you have pirated Steam games.
<Pizzicato> But you don't
<RobotPinkie> it's the top result for "friendship is magic" on Youtube, which is pretty funny
<VioletVanilla> 6I am tired too. . . x.x
<Pizzicato> Because you don't have Steam.
<DecapKing> 4im just here to make sure nothing happened
<DecapKing> 4well
<DecapKing> 4nothing else
<Luna> 07Violet we should relocate to the states..
<VioletVanilla> 6but I do like having just us
<RainbowDashCancel> I don't have pirated Steam games.
<Somepony> I want gmod.
<ReticentSmolder> 7(Sebrala = my idea of what the zebra homeland is called)
<VioletVanilla> 6and one poor male. . .
<Pizzicato> GMod is awesome.
<RainbowDashCancel> nor do I have any pirated GFWL games
<ValtheJean> >.<
<Luna> 07poor male?
<ValtheJean> actually wait
<VioletVanilla> 6I would if I could. . .
<TuxRug> RainbowDashCancel: it only tests for modded multiplayer games that use SteamGuard. If it detects a cheat mod while you're playing a game on a SteamGuard-enabled multiplayer server, then it will ban you from playing on SteamGuard servers
<ValtheJean> I'm used to this
<ValtheJean> I have 3 sisters
<ValtheJean> and I'm the youngest
<Somepony> I am going to put pony models in.
<SuperBrony64> It's a shame they don't actually land on the moon
*Silvermane 15shakes his head. "She flew out because of me. Not to mention she's normally a unicorn... but I probably hurt her more than ever just by not talking." He raises his hoof to his mouth and chews quietly on something from the tin.
*DeniedExistenceMobile gains a level! +5 to medicine, +3 to flying, +6 to Speech. New perk: Impervious to alcohol; It takes twice the amount of booze to make you shit-faced.
<GRRM> well
<GRRM> just finished the pilot
<Somepony> I am also going to make Pinkie cook panis cupcake into a cupcake
<GRRM> so Luna only shows up in there eh?
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Story: Somepony Who Loves You (http://tinyurl.com/43nhae4)
<Xiagu> GRRM, yep
<ReticentSmolder> 7(DE, don't you mean 'resistant' if you can still get drunk?)
<RainbowDashCancel> TuxRug hmm..."modded"?
*DecapKing 4walks over to the bed and checks on MirthTinker
<RainbowDashCancel> To be honest, the only things I would ever play online on Steam are maybe SSF4 AE and Portal 2
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Naw, next would be invulnerable)
<RainbowDashCancel> out of my current library
<TuxRug> RainbowDashCancel: modified to allow cheating, like unlimited ammo or walking through walls.
<ReticentSmolder> 7impervious = invulnerable >.>
<Somepony> Portal 2 online?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Not in my opinion)
<Somepony> Is that like Co-op with other people?
<SuperBrony64> Jolly good
<Xiagu> ^ yes
<GrimGallop> o.o
<TuxRug> ... Co-op with other people...
*VioletVanilla giggles~
<VioletVanilla> 6You reminded me of a rage comic, Val. .
<ReticentSmolder> 7 1. not permitting penetration or passage; impenetrable: The coat is impervious to rain. 2. incapable of being injured or impaired: impervious to wear and tear.
<RainbowDashCancel> TuxRug, pfft, I would never do that
<VioletVanilla> 6I can see you being like
<Somepony> Portal 2: Ponifed
<VioletVanilla> 6Okay. . .
<VioletVanilla> 6Wait a minute. . .
<VioletVanilla> 6ACTUALLY
<ValtheJean> oh?
<Cesco> But but Steam has Civilization 5!
<DecapKing> 4she seems to be breathing at a more normal pace now
<VioletVanilla> 6I AM USED TO THIS!
<SuperBrony64> O.o
<SuperBrony64> o.O
<SuperBrony64> O.O
<GrimGallop> O.O
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Fine..."Resistant" it is ya Nazi)
<Silvermane> 15... that's good. Is she really hurt?
<SuperBrony64> -.-
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (JK)
<Cesco> .....that is a good thing.
<ReticentSmolder> 7(hehe, not trying to be mean, just enhancing your vocab)
<RainbowDashCancel> Honestly, if you wanted to mod portal 2 to cheat and make the game easier, you have to be pretty bad at the game
<VioletVanilla> 6Heheheheh~
*Fluttershy 9sighs, sits down. "I feel like I did something bad anyway..."
<DecapKing> 4from my simply knowledge of anatomy of pegasi, she doesnt seem to have anything broken
<Xiagu> Somepony, there is a group doing that
<Fluttershy> 9Oh man just had the thought 'this would be so fun to turn into a comic' xP )
<RainbowDashCancel> and if you try to mod on SSF4 AE outside of harmless texture swaps, you don't deserve to be playing the game
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Walking in* No, she only flew into a wall.
<GrimGallop> My brain just exploded.
<Somepony> There is?
<ReticentSmolder> 7(I would read it, then again, I'm in it :P)
<Xiagu> Somepony, yep.
*Silvermane 15inhales deeply, feeling his eyes dilate. Fresh cola leaves... good stuff. "Besides kissing me, you didn't do a single thing wrong." Muttering to himself, "Honestly that doesn't even count..."
<ValtheJean> lol, you're scaring me violet :P
<Xiagu> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/map-of-equestria-and-portal-pony-mod.html here is one of the mentions of them
<RobotPinkie> You like bananas that much?
<SuperBrony64> I am terribly sorry to hear that
<Somepony> Yaaaaay
<Xiagu> http://thinkingwithponies.blogspot.com/2011/09/wheat-apples-cellos-and-random.html
*MirthTinker 13murmurs something half-conciously
<SuperBrony64> I actually prefer Cupcakes, but Bananas are quite good indeed.
*Fluttershy 9frowns, then pauses and looks up, biting her lip. "She's waking up... I... I should go."
<GrimGallop> This video is epic -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muVfidujxRg
<Natleyn> I don't like cupcakes anymore. :(
<Natleyn> inb4pinkamina
<Natleyn> Too much sugar.
<VioletVanilla> 6Scary?
<VioletVanilla> 6Me?
*MirthTinker 13falls back asleep, a sharp exhale with a slight pitch to it
<VioletVanilla> 6^-^
*Silvermane 15wanders over to MirthTinker, scanning the new pegasus for serious worries. "Fluttershy... I think it would be better if you just waited in the commons for a bit. Let me talk to her, then we 3 can have a chat."
<VioletVanilla> 6^-^
<Somepony> Well then, I shall go celebrate.
<VioletVanilla> 6^-^
<ValtheJean> O_o
<Silvermane> 15Oh, she's asleep again.
<MirthTinker> 13(yfw I'm doing THAT in my sleep again)
<Natleyn> Hurts mah teeth. u.u
<VioletVanilla> What EVER would make you think that dearie? n.~
<SuperBrony64> Oh yeah, the Physics lecture
<RobotPinkie> oh yeah I remember that guy, didn't he get sent a whole bunch of ponies by Hasbro+
<RobotPinkie> ?
<SuperBrony64> That must have taken some balls
<Silvermane> 15(not more scary humming...)
<GrimGallop> lol
<VioletVanilla> 6Hehehehehe. . . . .
<SuperBrony64> lol really?
<VioletVanilla> 6Heheheehehehe~~~
<VioletVanilla> Aha. . . Aahaahahaah~
<Fluttershy> 9yfw...? what does it stand for? >> )
*DeniedExistenceMobile returns to grinding on rats.
<ValtheJean> I don't wanna go I'm scared
<Silvermane> 15your face when
<SuperBrony64> Is that supposed to be a compliment from Hasbro?
<RobotPinkie> I'm pretty sure he did
<ValtheJean> mommy!
<Natleyn> He did.
<Silvermane> 15opposite of MFW, my face when
<Natleyn> There are pictures.
<DecapKing> 4i think that she might have something wrong with her respiratory system
<VioletVanilla> 6Dies ist das Gefühl, wir alle haben. . .~
*Fluttershy 9flinches, then nods slightly, trotting past the ponies in the room to sit dejectedly in the commons area.
<ValtheJean> QUIT SPEAKING LANGUAGES THAT AREN'T AMERICAN
<GrimGallop> I need to call some random show out for physical impossibilities.
*MirthTinker 13the sharp passing of air comes to a halt, finding a pitch. Her mouth closes, letting the pitch reverberate and flow. A song forms, haunting and beautiful with somber tones and lilting melodies.
<RobotPinkie> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/physics-brony-gets-pile-of-free-pony.html
<ValtheJean> I AM ALONE AND FRAGILE
<RobotPinkie> yup, foundit
<GRRM> haha
<GRRM> I just read the wired article
<SuperBrony64> Wow can't believe it
<GrimGallop> Whoa. Awesome.
<Xiagu> GRRM, and?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Oh hey fluttershy.Just level grinding on rats.
<SuperBrony64> I mean...my mind is conflicted
<DecapKing> 4uh, is that a normal thing she does?
<GRRM> why did they choose the most awkward guy in the world to interview?
*Silvermane 15shivers, remembering the last time she did this. Acting quickly for his ill body, he trots over and nudges her softly, attempting to rouse her.
<GRRM> well
<Octavia> 13VV calls people "dearie". lol Thats kinda cute.
<VioletVanilla> 6poor. . . little. . . lost. . . American. . . ^.^ Teehee~
<Xiagu> GRRM, lol
<Luna> 07Hey I do too...
<Luna> 07Never noticed?
<Pizzicato> I know a guy named Matt who's definitely more awkward.
*ValtheJean cries
<Silvermane> 15Occasionally. Would you mind giving us a moment? She's probably going to be... jumpy.
<SuperBrony64> On one hand, it's awesome getting free shit like My Little Pony, but on the other it's still getting My Little Pony stuff...
<GRRM> I learned more about the theory of friendship and mind than in the entire 30 years of my life
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, they're journalists.
<Xiagu> he has said that they picked basically the worst picture of him to use :/
*Luna soothes ValtheJean
<Octavia> 13Oh sorry, Luna. I didnt notice. ^^;;
<VioletVanilla> 6Luna is cutest of all cutes <#
<GRRM> that's what I learned
*DecapKing 4feels a chill come over his body
<DecapKing> 4ok
<VioletVanilla> 6 <3 *
<Luna> 07Lies
*MirthTinker 13wakes up suddenly in mid-song. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAH MOTHER! NO!"
<Luna> 07i'm just me
<DecapKing> 4ill be outside
<Pizzicato> He says he's a 'writer', quit his job at Wal-Mart, married a 19 year old, and now collects unemployment.
<Luna> 07the pony from the moon
<Octavia> 13As her sig states. :P
<RobotPinkie> lol I like the official merch
*DecapKing 4jumps back
<Luna> 07indeed
<GRRM> we;;
<GRRM> he outright said 'I have aspergers'
*Fluttershy 9looks up at DE, then back down, tearing up. "I'm a bad pony..."
<SuperBrony64> How so?
<Natleyn> I'd get a few figures if I had bits. :c
<ValtheJean> I don't wanna DJ with you anymore!
*ValtheJean feels less threatened
<JackiePie> uh huh
*Silvermane 15falls back onto his flank, surprised and mildly shocked. Reacting quickly, he leans forward. "Tink, Tink are you okay?"
<Pizzicato> Wha?
<MirthTinker> 13Wha, how did I get here?
*DeniedExistenceMobile hugs Fluttershy
<SuperBrony64> I mean, it's still the same dolls before, but now based on an awesome version of the show
<Luna> 07but i'm glad we had this think-tank tonight
<JackiePie> Asperger's Syndrome
<Luna> 07some great ideas!
<ValtheJean> PHOTOBUCKET! Y U STUCK AT 94%?
<Silvermane> 15DecapKing and DE found you
<RobotPinkie> well, and less creepy-looking
<VioletVanilla> 6Oh. . . Oh we will DJ. . . Val. . . . We will. . . . . ;D You just wait. . .
<VioletVanilla> 6SOON
<SuperBrony64> Unless they were physical statues that looked EXACTLY like the characters in the show...then maybe I would do it
<DeniedExistenceMobile> No you aren't, just a good pony who made a bad decision.
*DecapKing 4gets back up
<Bpendragon> Essentially low-grade Autism
<ValtheJean> .....~hide me~......
*ReticentSmolder 7is writing on a scroll on his desk from across the hall, listening intently, but working.
<Pizzicato> Isn't that what socially awkward teenaged hypochondriacs on the internet say they have so they can have an excuse for being socially awkward mooks?
<Silvermane> 15Seeing as I'm not in much condition to chase you around...
<DecapKing> 4you crashed into a wall
<Bpendragon> Pizzicato yes that too
<SuperBrony64> You know, the small figurines that they have for anime shows and stuff
<JackiePie> That would be high functioning Autism Bpendragon, not Asperger's Syndrome
<JackiePie> Asperger's Syndrome means trouble socializing mostly
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Yelling up the stairs* You fought the wall and the wall won!
*VioletVanilla is giggling uncontrollably.
*MirthTinker 13looks around, seeing the ponies in the room. "Oh, oh CELESTIA! I've got to go!"
<TuxOtaku> GRRM, it occurs to me that they very well could have interviewed a multitude of people and simply picked the most socially maladjusted one of the lot.
<JackiePie> With other comorbid things.
<RobotPinkie> Well they have the blind bag ponies... those are pretty accurate
<Bpendragon> However, my cousin (a computeer geek) actually does have it
*Fluttershy 9flinches slightly, but sighs. "No... I... I think I've done something truly terrible. Now I'm jealous and... and I can't do anything about it. I'm so angry at myself, it makes me want to... makes me want to.." Fluttershy bit her lip, then opened her mouth to let out a long yet soft scream.
<SuperBrony64> But a doll that comes with accessories to comb their manes...
*DeniedExistenceMobile laughs.
<JackiePie> High functioning Autism, is basically Autism but better
<ValtheJean> stupid Twilight....
<GRRM> I have to admit that made me laugh really hard
<GRRM> I mean, it doesn't affect my view of the show
<GRRM> I already love the show
<GRRM> but man, this would not be a good go-to source
<GRRM> well, it's trendy on the internet to have aspergers now
<GRRM> exactly Pizzicato
<DecapKing> 4WHOA WHOA WHOA
<ValtheJean> no, stupid google
*DecapKing 4stops MirthTinker
<CogWeaver> lag
<Pizzicato> Yeah.
<Pizzicato> I saw that.
<ValtheJean> google should know when I search for "Twilight" I mean the pony!
<SuperBrony64> I guess I'm not at the stage of acceptance yet >_<
<DecapKing> 4you cant fly in this condition
<TuxOtaku> Aspergers is the new ADD
<Pizzicato> I was like wow this GRRM types fast oh wait lag.
<JackiePie> I have been officially diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome
*Silvermane 15crawls up onto the bed and uses his hindleg to pin her wing, as he taught her.
<RobotPinkie> lol it might not come at all, some don't like the brushables
<VioletVanilla> 6What other Twilight is there? o:
<Bpendragon> Asperger disorder ( /ˈɑːspərɡərz/[1] or /ˈæspərɡərz/[2]) is an autism spectrum disorder
<Natleyn> I'm still shy about it, but I'm like that with every show I like, so I assume I'm final stage brony
*DeniedExistenceMobile hugs Fluttershy tighter, it's gonna be ok,
<Fluttershy> 9You know teh scream I speak of, right? >3> )
<MirthTinker> 13NO GET OFF ME! YOU DON'T LOVE ME STOP PRETENDING YOU DO!
<JackiePie> Yes?
<Bpendragon> from wikipedia, often asserts itself with high-functioning autism,
<Luna> 07Looks like we are gonna have a busy weekend...
*Fluttershy 9shakes her head. "I don't know about that..."
<Silvermane> 15MirthTinker. Look at me. Calm down.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (I think so..)
<TuxOtaku> people with Aspergers have trouble functioning in social situations
<RobotPinkie> >army of killer scarecrows
<ValtheJean> I like busy weekends :P
<ValtheJean> makes me feel alive
<RobotPinkie> >cue happy flute music
<Natleyn> ... there was an ant in my ear
<JackiePie> Well that's only because ignorant people aren't able to understand there is a clear difference.
<Sheep> yo yo yo, whats up everypony
<Natleyn> wat
<JackiePie> Aspies do not behave stereotypically Autistic.
<SuperBrony64> Haha, even if you are 5% shy about it, you haven't reached the final stage
<Luna> 07Sprinkles:"-_-; Well that really sucks. We're gonna have to hammer everything out this weekend. We're definitely going to have to do another stress test early next week."
<JackiePie> They don't flap their arms when they get upset, or things like that.
<MirthTinker> 13NO! MY MOTHER- YOU- THAT OTHER MARE, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS!
<JackiePie> They appear normal if not for a few comorbids
<GRRM> possibly
<GRRM> lol
<GRRM> I have lag too
<GRRM> well, I'm watching another ep, and then I got to head to bed
<GRRM> I like the show so far
<DecapKing> 4wait wait wait
*MirthTinker 13tries desperately to fight her own anatomy to get away
<RobotPinkie> lol I dunno about that, some people arejust shy in general
<Luna> 07and a busy week too..
<DecapKing> 4just calm down
<Purple`Prose> What episode are you watching?
<Sheep> GRRM, what are you watching?
<Fluttershy> 9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l1sgfLmC1Y for clarification. >> )
<TuxOtaku> example: someone with Aspergers is at a funeral, knows everyone is in a down mood, but is in a way unable to empathize
<Fluttershy> 9for clarification purposes. )
<SuperBrony64> I assume there is someone out there that will dress up as one of the characters walking around at ANY CHANCE OF DOING SO while using quotes on a minute-to-minute basis
<Natleyn> Send me to a job interview, I'll be like Fluttershy >.>
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Oh, Silver may not be the element of loyalty, but he is not far from
<JackiePie> Tux that is also false
<JackiePie> Aspies can empathize
<SuperBrony64> Haha
<JackiePie> They may not express it the same way a neurotypical or "normal" person would.
<RobotPinkie> lol I hope that's not the final stage
<JackiePie> Therfore it's assumed they are unempathetic.
<Fluttershy> Huh? o-o
*ReticentSmolder 7(is the element of shippery)
<TuxOtaku> ok
<Natleyn> That's not final stage, that's a different type of brony.
<SuperBrony64> I'm sure we can all relate certain emotional situations to a ponies' character
<SuperBrony64> With my luck
*Silvermane 15sighs, hating what he has gotten himself into. Reaching behind his neck, he pulls off the chain he has taken to wearing at all times, placing it before MirthTinker. "You need to stop fighting. Just relax. You know what this chain means, right?
<Natleyn> Dude, I don't even
<TuxOtaku> so it's more that they just can't connect "oh, everyone's sad" to "don't tell a fart joke" or something
<TrollightSparkle> So uh.. stages of brony development?
<JackiePie> Something like that
<TuxOtaku> I know that's kind of a weird way of putting it
<Natleyn> I have eep'd in public before and scooted away to dark corners
<JackiePie> Well that's a pretty good way of putting it.
<Purple`Prose> I think the DSM V is open on the internet...
*Silvermane 15(is the element of oh dear god what is wrong with you?)
<Sheep> why... are we talking about social disorders...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (xD)
<SuperBrony64> "eep'd"? You mean like what Fluttershy does?
<JackiePie> I just jumped at that, because there's a history of people assuming people on the Autism Spectrum are unempathetic, and therfore less than human.
<Pizzicato> *shrug*, 'cause.
<JackiePie> Or more prone to behaving cruelly
<Natleyn> First episode, yeah
<RainbowDashCancel> um, Sheep, that's how this chatroom works. XD
<MirthTinker> 13YES I-....yes, I do. Don't just think that you can win me back by putting yourself up to my control. Relationships have to work both ways Silver.
<RainbowDashCancel> go from one topic to the next
<Bpendragon> I never said that, I was stating facts
<TuxOtaku> Sheep, because Wired had an article about MLP fandom, and interviewed a guy who said he was Aspie.
<JackiePie> Yeah it's random
<JackiePie> I'm stating facts too.
<Fluttershy> My ears are on fire... =-=
*DeniedExistenceMobile lays down with Fluttershy.
<Caramel> wow
<RainbowDashCancel> and especially when someone gets excited about explaining a certain topic
<SuperBrony64> Please tell me you are a girl if you did that
<Caramel> that was...weird
<DecapKing> 4MirthTinker, are you going to freak out again?
<Natleyn> I'm sorry, Fluttershy
<Caramel> I got kicked out again >.<
<GrimGallop> Lol @ Fluttershy
<DeniedExistenceMobile> It's gonna be fine, I know these things.
<Sheep> u___u thats so stupid. Why do news shows always have to get the worst people for interviews
<Pizzicato> Yea it's why the channel turns to shit when we start talking about music
<Pizzicato> Because I do not shut up when it comes to music.
<Natleyn> Nope. :C
*Fluttershy 9starts to cry again. "Oh what have I done? I let my feelings get the better of me..."
<RobotPinkie> The one thing that everyone seems to have in common eventually is thinking "omfg ponies are so awesome, why did I not see this before?"
<KnightLight> Hey, everypony!
<MirthTinker> 13Possibly, but this time it will be level-headed, cold, and rational freaking out...unless I get some answers.
<TuxOtaku> Sheep, shock value
<Sheep> hello KnightLight
<Pizzicato> Heya
<GRRM> Ticket Master
<GRRM> I'm watching Ticket Master now
<GRRM> well
<GRRM> I brought up the Wired article
<Luna> 07You might want to check your pc sometime... it might be suffering from parasprites
<RainbowDashCancel> Pizzicato XD Yeah, a couple hours ago we were talking about music,
<Fluttershy> SuperBrony64: I'm a girl irl d; I also do streamception sometimes
<GRRM> because that guy learned more about the theory of friendship and mind than in the entire 30 years of his life
<SuperBrony64> Well...it's because we didn't have Faust Vision for G3.5 and below
<Natleyn> I saw G4 was awesome.
<Caramel> I miss anything after busy week?
<RainbowDashCancel> then ponies
*Silvermane 15smiles sadly, glad to see the desired effects have taken hold. "I know. But that's not the point. Control is only useful when it is given willingly, not taken forcefully. But that's besides the point right now. We need to talk for a moment."
<RainbowDashCancel> then Hamlet
<Luna> 07nope
<RainbowDashCancel> and then I went to far with Hamlet and then we talked about Team fortress 2
<Sheep> GRRM: welcome to ponies
<DecapKing> 4want me to leave?
<JackiePie> Well the problem GRRM is that society isn't typicall condusive to friendship and that is very confusing to Aspies.
<GRRM> heh thanks
*KnightLight tries to bro-hoof CogWeaver, but misses and accidentally gets him in the shoulder
<JackiePie> Like, how mean people can get ahead in life. We don't get that.
<Fluttershy> Streamception is fun. ^^ Right everypony who's been here for it?
<SuperBrony64> These words..."streamception"...confuse me
<KnightLight> oops, sorry about that...
<Sheep> !S2
<Silvermane> 15If you would please. Go relax, have a drink, maybe check on Fluttershy if she seems distressed. We'll be fine.
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:08h:42m:28s
<JackiePie> It's more of a higher sense and desire for fairness.
<Sheep> omg 8 days 8 hours
*DeniedExistenceMobile strokes Fluttershy's back. "It isnt your fault, if all you do is blame yourself, no good will ever come of it."
<DecapKing> 4no problem
<Fluttershy> hehe...
<RobotPinkie> Yep
*CogWeaver gets knocked down*
*DecapKing 4leaves and goes to the commons area
<RobotPinkie> lol it's a stream within a stream, SuperBrony64
<KnightLight> TOO long!
<ValtheJean> no, it's definitely the internet connection
<ValtheJean> everyone in the building is having issues
<Sheep> way too long.
<CogWeaver> I know...
<Sheep> !link
<DerpyBot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVh5hrFv0bE - Pony Holocaust Teaser
<RainbowDashCancel> Um, Jackie, don't mean to stop your explanation, but I think he can read the wiki article if he wants to
<SuperBrony64> :S
<SuperBrony64> I'm lost here...
<Natleyn> I'm a pretty-well-in-shape guy. I do parkour and stuff on a regular basis.
<KnightLight> like, 8 hours, 8 minutes too long!
<DecapKing> 4dont mind me
<DecapKing> 4im here for booze
<JackiePie> Fine, if he would rather believe an article, then an actual person living with Asperger's Syndrome.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ....
*Fluttershy 9sighs, burying her face into her folded forelegs. "Maybe if I just disappear for a while everypony will forget how mean I am..."
<GRRM> no it's fine
<CogWeaver> uh...don't you mean 'days', Knight?
<SuperBrony64> I do homework and study like a boss on a regular basis
<TuxOtaku> Sheep, it's easier to sell magazines which have some kind of shocking article on depraved pseudo-autistic maladroits who watch cartoon ponies and may rape and kill and do horrible things, than it is to sell a magazine about geeks who are attracted to the pure innocence of a cartoon as a contrast to the fucked up times we live in.
<JackiePie> Hi
<SuperBrony64> So I'm well out of shape
<KnightLight> oh, lol!
<RobotPinkie> it's when one of the streamers streams another stream.
<Fluttershy> SuperBrony64: When Luna streams, sometimes she will show a stream of what I'm doing.
*DecapKing 4goes and gets a bottle of whiskey from the fridge
<JackiePie> Whoa what Tux
<JackiePie> lol
<SuperBrony64> But mentally, I'm stronger than ever
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Already scavenged the fridge. I am waitng for the respawn.
*KnightLight just derp'd
<DecapKing> 4damn
<TragicStoryTeller> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quazTOZokd4
<JackiePie> That was nuts!
*Silvermane 15gets off of MirthTinker's wings, letting her up. He replaces the chain around his neck, the tail in front... just in case. He looks over at Tinker
*DecapKing 4goes over to DE and Fluttershy
<SuperBrony64> Is it okay to cross streams?
<Sheep> he was replying to me, I asked why interview an aspie
<GrimGallop> No.
*ReticentSmolder 7thinks Fluttershy will fit in just fine here...oh yes, just fine
<Toasty> Is your body ready?
<Natleyn> Well, pretty well in shape, but my cardio is terrible.
<GrimGallop> Only as a last resort.
<Sheep> instead of someone not socially inept
<Natleyn> Hello Toasty :3
<JackiePie> I know, but I'm saying depraved psuedo-Autistic and rape and kill, oh wait wasn't this a PG chat?
<Fluttershy> 9oh? )
<Toasty> hello :D
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Your a wonderful pony.
*ReticentSmolder 7also feels happy knowing his dual-identity is a secret to some
<CogWeaver> yes, it is
<DecapKing> 4Fluttershy
<TuxOtaku> yeah sorry....
<Silvermane> 15(she's handling the high-emotion part fine... but wait for the /other/ part first...)
<CogWeaver> #EquestriaAfterDark
<Toasty> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VznlDlNPw4Q&feature=related
<RainbowDashCancel> Look, JackiePie, I understand it's tough being someone diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, and you want to explain to the world about your struggles in society, but we don't need to open up the DS-whatever right now
<CogWeaver> go there for this type of convo.
<Luna> 07hmm you could run a traffic monitor..
<TuxOtaku> I got a little defensive there for a second
<DecapKing> 4disappearing doesnt solve any problems
<Toasty> 10 hours
<Toasty> of catchy awesomeness
<GrimGallop> o.o
<JackiePie> Also Asperger's Syndrome isn't psuedo Autism, it is a form of Autism on the higher functioning end of the Autism Spectrum.
<GRRM> EquestriaAfterDark?
<Luna> 07We had a parasprite abusing our connection a while ago
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, I'm not saying it is
<DecapKing> 4i have always been trying to run from the specters in my past
<RobotPinkie> oh wow
<TuxOtaku> I'm saying that's what the ignorant masses see it as
<JackiePie> Okay you want me to be quiet now
<SuperBrony64> Wow, he sounds like the guy from Pirates of the Carribean
<Sheep> GRRM: 18+ pony chat
*Fluttershy 9shakes her head again, not believing him.
<JackiePie> I didn't realize I did something so wrong
<CogWeaver> GRRM: it's the "mature" section of the pony-chats
<Silvermane> 15(inb4 Gilda)
<PsychicKid> why is there an sperger's discussion in this chan
<DecapKing> 4moving from city to city
<DeniedExistenceMobile> DecapKing: +2 to speech.
<JackiePie> There isn't
<GRRM> oh
<JackiePie> Not anymore
<Sheep> there isnt
<PsychicKid> good
<Xiagu> GRRM, varies between sexy rp and politics discussion
<Sheep> dont even pay attention
<ReticentSmolder> 7(oh yeah, guess I should mention that, Fluttershy, we /do/ write clopfic in here occaisionally...sometimes...a lot)
<ValtheJean> >mfw I have no idea what that is
<PsychicKid> i hate hearing about it :V
<GRRM> sexy rp and politics eh?
<CogWeaver> ...

<Sheep> yes
<TragicStoryTeller> I stole your glomp
<SuperBrony64> What did I say?
<Sheep> omg....
<JackiePie> !hug
*ReticentSmolder 7resolves to never mention clopping again in the presence of Fluttershy
<Silvermane> 15(clopfic is... well, do you know what clopping means?)
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<JackiePie> yes
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around JackiePie in a tight embrace
<Luna> 07We had someone liften with us on our wifi.. while he was visiting various "evil" websites
<RainbowDashCancel> I tried going to EquestriaAfterDark.
<RainbowDashCancel> T_T
<Toasty> sorry
<SuperBrony64> Assuming you were referring to me
<Toasty> vid
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Ahem* It is the pony equivalent of....oh should I spoil the pure innocence?)
<Sheep> you dont need to say yes to hugtiem
<JackiePie> I didn't know
<GRRM> well I mean do they
<DecapKing> 4do you get what im saying Fluttershy?
<Sheep> xD
<Fluttershy> 9um... clopping is the sounds horses make when they walk/run? )
<ReticentSmolder> 7we don't need to talk about it if somepony doesn't know, we can't corrupt the innocent like that can we?
<RainbowDashCancel> Weiiiiirrrrdddd place. My adult mind couldn't even fathom it
<SuperBrony64> Is LotR a good series?
<SuperBrony64> Worth watching?
<Silvermane> 15(okay, let her keep the innocence. I can't ruin that for anypony so cute)
<Toasty> not a clue in the world
<Toasty> sorry
<ReticentSmolder> 7yes, that is EXACTLY what it means Fluttershy
<CogWeaver> it's a baaaaaad place
<MontanaPony4eva> I think so
<Sheep> I've never been to EqAD
<ValtheJean> *inception button* BRAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Well...we COULD)
<Dashite> No, it's horrible. Best not to bother.
<RobotPinkie> I'd say so, definitely
<MontanaPony4eva> assuming you're talking about the movie trilogy
<CogWeaver> and, sadly, I have to moderate it T_T
<Xiagu> CogWeaver, dont' hate
<ReticentSmolder> 7NO
<Toasty> oops, gtg, ttyl
*KnightLight plans to never visit EquestriaAfterDark.
<Fluttershy> 9.... In real life, my mind is far from innocent. I just have never heard of this term before. )
<RobotPinkie> lolol Dashite
<Sheep> xD
<SuperBrony64> No, the TV show
<ReticentSmolder> 7...oh
<CogWeaver> good policy, Knight
<RainbowDashCancel> I jump in and the first thing I see is a violence fic
<MontanaPony4eva> oh, well then in that case, I have no idea XD
<DecapKing> 4(pony based erotica)
*Silvermane 15goes to find images...
<ReticentSmolder> 7well, you never know

<MontanaPony4eva> I'm doing too many things at once sorry, lol
<VioletVanilla> 6I mean, I am too, but. . .

<MontanaPony4eva> I'm a little absent-minded to obviousness right now
<ReticentSmolder> 7clopping...to put this delicately...

<Natleyn> Hiya Dashite.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (*Waits for thought to sink in*)
<RainbowDashCancel> I was like, "What? No! Fictional violence is supposed to be over the top and funny, not like this!"
<mook> hi sheep

*Octavia 13hugs VV back
<KnightLight> My thinking is this: if MLP: FiM was originally meant to be PG-13 or R (if it were a movie), then I wouldn't like it anyway. So why subject myself to that sort of stuff now when MLP: FiM is awesome as it is, happily in G-rated territory? Just my opinion, tho...
<SuperBrony64> Grey Rainbow Dash
<TuxOtaku> Spose, stupid Rihanna ruined that song for me
<SuperBrony64> That's actually a flashback sequence
*Luna joins in the hug
<Spose> She did, but then ponies made it better again.
*ValtheJean throws a cake at Octavia...I mean hugs Octavia
<JackiePie> Tux didn't you invite me to EAD?
<Spose> Spin Vynl is the cutest thing ever.
<SuperBrony64> wow, so flashback is a user here :P
<TuxOtaku> I hate it when crappy pop acts sample/cover songs
<RobotPinkie> don't want to hear, even if it's a joke
<Octavia> 13I dunno. Over-reacting probably.
<Azure_CoalSpark> ello everyone
<Octavia> 13lol
<Spose> Eh, they do it right sometimes.
<DecapKing> 4(so we have that sorted out?)
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, yeah, nm though.
<Sheep> I think that Lyra and Bon-Bon should be portrayed as Filly Foolers
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Anyway, that's over)
<Spose> Like Kanye did Power.
<Fluttershy> 9xP )
<JackiePie> okay
<SuperBrony64> It kind of ties the storyline together a bit more
<TuxOtaku> Spose, I've never seen it done well
<TuxOtaku> ever.
<Octavia> 13Everytime I see that Ask Octavia blog too I feel like I'm going to rage up a storm.
<Spose> Its like 12 girls for every one boy.
<ReticentSmolder> 7also, I've written clopfic, which is saucy relations between ponies or characters from the show
<Silvermane> 15(anyways, waiting on you Tinkerbelle)
<Fluttershy> 9- laughs like Pinkamena Diane Pie - )
<Spose> Everyone is a filly fooler
<Sheep> exactly
<mook> btw http://ponyspin.com/ got a konami code
<Sheep> I mean, canon
<JackiePie> I apologize for earlier, I just was trying to educate people.
<Silvermane> 15(also i've starred in several clopfics)
<mook> but i have no idea how to input it
*ValtheJean has no idea what that is
<DecapKing> 4(im waiting on you Fluttershy)
<Octavia> 13Feels like someone trying to steal your identity and going rampant with it. Because they can draw that makes them -the- Octavia?!
<Spose> I heard 21st Century Schizoid Man.
<SuperBrony64> The shock scene with all the ponies is when they find out they are being accompanied by Luna
<Spose> Didn't like it much. Like Kanye's better.
<Spose> Hes a total asshole, but hes also a good artist.
<SuperBrony64> But that's all the spoilers I know
<SuperBrony64> So yeah
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, np, personally I don't see what's wrong with that.
<Fluttershy> 9DecapKing: ah sorry )
<JackiePie> Apparently we can only discuss ponies here
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (My friend, emerald is a furry erotica writer, infected me with the erotica bug XP
<RainbowDashCancel> JackiePie, it's fine. Monologues are an Aspergian's specialty. Ya can't do them all the time though
*Fluttershy 9trembles, but nods. "Still..."
<SuperBrony64> ANYWAY
<JackiePie> I wasn't doing a monologue
<SuperBrony64> Season 2
<SuperBrony64> 9 days
<JackiePie> I was trying to express a complicated subject
<Spose> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srUyAIjCdo Thats why I like Power. I watch that every day.
<Sheep> I was fine with the discussion, but...
<feio345> whats aspergers
<SuperBrony64> and some odd hours and what not
<Luna> 07yep!
*MirthTinker 13doesn't look Silver in the eye. "Silvermane...it doesn't work like that. I never had control of you before, you made /that/ painfully obvious. Its a matter of the breakdown in our mutual trust now...I don't know if I can trust you anymore."
<Fluttershy> 9I've been RPing since I was 13, guys. =w=; I didn't really do anything erotic til about 15, but still. )
<ValtheJean> :(
<SuperBrony64> I bet you are excited!
<DecapKing> 4if you think what you did was bad, then you dont want to know what i have done
<Octavia> 13Like that fucken Vicki bitch. Got the part to voice Octavia in The Vinyl Scratch Tapes project then proceeded to call me a poser. ME!? I'm the fucken original bitch!? If ANYONE is the embodiment of Octavia, its me!
<Luna> 07YEP!
<Spose> Thats just a weird thing to discuss between bronies.
<Sheep> feio345: it's a social disorder
<RobotPinkie> ohay Luna
<SuperBrony64> Your first camo since episode 2
<TuxOtaku> feio345, it's a form of high-functioning neurological disorder that is loosely related to autism
<KnightLight> :D
<Spose> Ponism is supposed to be a escape, and talking about our disorders defeats the point.
<Luna> 07and 18hrs:31mins before BMN Starts!
<JackiePie> Is it a monologue when I normal person tries to explain something?
<Natleyn> Luna! Hiya
*Natleyn hugs Luna
<feio345> oh ok
<Radimir> So, I assume that 100% of people in this channel have been officially diagnosed with Asperger's.
<Luna> 07We have a great line up!
<DeniedExistenceMobile> OOC Fluttershy: New perk. My head is full of fuck... +35 to insanity, +15 to charisma)
<roushguy> I have that
<Sheep> SO back to ponies
<Luna> 07I mean Rocky horror!
<Silvermane> 15(^)
<TuxOtaku> Radimir, not I sir
<Efreet> i have dyspraxia
<Ali1017> Yeah, why are we talking about that anyway?
<Efreet> your arguements are inert
*Fluttershy 9shakes her head violently. "But you don't get it!" Fluttershy cried, lifting up her head. "If I've done this, who knows what else I'll do?! Celestia... s-she'll lock me away..."
<RobotPinkie> I mean True Romance!
<TuxOtaku> I just have ADD
<Sheep> has everyone seen this? (hold on 2 secs)
<roushguy> I'm actually enrolled in the Haugland Learning Center
<SuperBrony64> Rocky is still alive?
<MirthTinker> 13(Fluttershy, yfw I have a 50 page log of SilverxMe rp campaign)
<roushguy> Which is for people with Aspergers
<JackiePie> We're discussing what ever you want to Ali
<VioletVanilla> 6Mmmmmm.. .
<Xiagu> Radimir, look what you did
<SuperBrony64> I thought Rainbow Dash killed him
<Luna> 07no no.. the rocky horror picture show :)
<Luna> 07not Rocky the movie ;)
<Radimir> I just wanted to watch the world burn.
<Octavia> 13Maybe I've grown a bit partial to Octavia and being the one who coined her name, or one of the originals anyway... I feel like... uggggh!
<Fluttershy> 9MirthTinker: oh dear )
<SuperBrony64> He has his own show now too?!
*Luna hugs BronyState
<VioletVanilla> 6Thus the feeling I had about having things stolen comes back. . .
<Efreet> You're a pyromaniac!
<Octavia> 13Yeah...
*DecapKing 4places a hoof on Fluttershy's shoulder
<Sheep> http://www.deviantart.com/#/d49a538
<Fluttershy> 9DeniedExistenceMobile: Huh? o-o )
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (This is relevant to my interests)
*Efreet hands Radimir gasoline
<Sheep> I think
<RainbowDashCancel> I guess since everyone's opening up about their diagnoses, I probably should too.
<Sheep> that is the cutest thing i've ever seen
<JackiePie> What if the mods get mad
*GrimGallop 6facehoofs
<DecapKing> 4(fallout?)
<SuperBrony64> Well I wasn't talking about the movie either :S
<VioletVanilla> 6It is okay Octavia. . . Let it out as you need to. . . We are here.
<Sheep> or one of.
<Luna> 07lol
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, well not exactly, Sir Lintsalot has his own show, and Rocky is his sidekick.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (It's a meme name)
<Fluttershy> 9I think I feel loved though I'm not sure... =w=; )
<Octavia> 13It basically feels like someone stole my OC (I know technically she isnt mine) and is claiming it for themselves!
<Spose> Then you'll still have your disorder, on the moon.
<Luna> 07it happends...
<Fluttershy> 9People seem to like my streamception though. o-o )
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Your loved)
<GrimGallop> 6Sir Lintsalot should get his own spinoff.
<JackiePie> I don't want to be kicked just for trying to explain something.
<GrimGallop> 0Fiiiine
<RainbowDashCancel> Pfft, the mods won't care unless we start spamming or talking about +18 stuff
<Octavia> 13They are basically stealing my identity and I'M being called the fake.
<SuperBrony64> Anyword about Mr. Turnip?
<Spose> Time and place to discuss stuff.
<RainbowDashCancel> like the Hamlet thing I was saying earlier
*Silvermane 15looks down at his hooves. "You probably shouldn't trust me. At least not yet. I broke your trust, even if it wasn't on purpose. I never meant to lead her to believe I was... but I talked to her and straightened things out, at least a little."
*Fluttershy 9blinks, then lowers her head, tearing up again. "Oh what do I do...? I'm in love with a colt who loves somepony else."
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (I must see this log eventually MirthTinker )
<SuperBrony64> Is Madame LeFlour doing her own cooking show now?
<DecapKing> 4listen, i have met Princess Celestia, and even after the rampage, she still let me stay here
<Silvermane> 15(oh yes you must)
<GrimGallop> 0Oh, hey, right there at #2...
<Spose> Okay, who broke my internet.
*KnightLight has found something interesting to read, and so will not only be heavily distracted, but completely undisturbable for the next little while...
<MirthTinker> 13I've got a googledoc for it, most of it is raw, but the last half to quarter of it is just Silver and I's responses
<TuxOtaku> so yeah, I'm really getting into a lot of these new indie synthpop bands that have been popping up recently.
*RainbowDashCancel wonders if Pizzicato is still here
<DecapKing> 4i have been through something like that before
<JackiePie> Like?
<Luna> 07The best thing you can do is ignore them..
<Pizzicato> Huh?
<Sheep> AAAnyways everypony, I'm going to go grab a bite to eat, I'll be back later if anypony is interested.
<Spose> Later Sheep!
<Sheep> ciao guys
<RainbowDashCancel> I guess someone BAROQUE'D Spose's internet!
<ValtheJean> wow...this is starting to get annoying
<MirthTinker> 13https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qs_gd858-qIbyqdRg3MhEKPZO8uwWTFuwkuWZcc9na4/edit?pli=1&hl=en_US
<RainbowDashCancel> *rimshot*
<JackiePie> badumching!
<ValtheJean> the disconnects that is
<Silvermane> 15(let's just assume only about 1/3 of it is us bucking... >.> )
<Spose> I don't get it Rainbow Dash, but my feelings are hurt all the same.
<DecapKing> 4it ended in heartbreak, but through that i was able to make myself stronger
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, Miami Horror, Crystal Castles (woohoo fellow Torontonians), The Naked and Famous, Beef Terminal (again, fellow T-Dotter)
<MirthTinker> 13careful, its been known to slow or crash slower computers
<Octavia> 13Yeah. But its not me. Its the community.
<Spose> ...Why do ponies have cows and pigs?
<Spose> I guess they can use the cow's milk.
<TuxOtaku> Goldfrapp, La Roux, Royksopp
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zst3QUsPRY
<RainbowDashCancel> Spose, I wasn't making fun of your internet, I was making a pun on the word broke
<Spose> But why the pigs?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (I loaded it in 1 sec)
<JackiePie> I've heard of Crystal Castle
<JackiePie> and the last 3 bands you've mentioned
<JackiePie> I <3 Goldfrapp
<Silvermane> 15(mfw we spent this much time RPing and it's not even canon to our plot. lawl)
<Fluttershy> 9I have a good laptop. ^^ It was slow for a bit now it's good. )
<Spose> Oh, I get it now.
<MirthTinker> 13(well, it hasn't done it for me, somepony else just told me it did)
<RainbowDashCancel> Baroque is a period of music history in the 1700's-1800's
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Do I get a cookie?)
<Spose> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, definitely check out Miami Horror then
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Spose in a tight embrace
<TuxOtaku> you'd like them
<Silvermane> 15(you got many cookies. when you opened that file)
<JackiePie> i will
<VioletVanilla> 6Octavia, if it means anything, we can not change the community, but you ARE Octavia to us. You always will be.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (xD)
<Spose> On to my demo
*Luna is counting down
<Spose> Later guyz
<MirthTinker> 13(mfw implied viruses?)
<JackiePie> bye
<Luna> 07Indeed
<ValtheJean> yeah! Screw them! WE'RE your community!
<RainbowDashCancel> See ya!
<TuxOtaku> I guess you could put The Yeah Yeah Yeahs in that group too
<Spose> Oh, installing.
<Filter|ComesAndGoes> phuken jackets
<Spose> Blegh.
<GRRM> bye
<TuxOtaku> and Florence and the Machine
<RobotPinkie> but yeah, looking forward to seeing True Romance again
<Silvermane> 15(no, cookies. small bits of data used to streamline loading of pages
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (I am on an IPhone, I fear no
<Spose> Florence <3
<DeniedExistenceMobile> virii)
*Luna hugs Octavia once more
<TuxOtaku> ot
<TuxOtaku> err
<Spose> Wolf Like Me by TV on the Radio.
<JackiePie> Tux do you like Lykke Li?
<TuxOtaku> stupid keyboard
<Pizzicato> http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr8k8oHOz41r2av34o1_500.gif Poor Lyra! Look at her face!
<Octavia> 13Thanks guys.
*Octavia 13hugs back
<TuxOtaku> and yes, Lykke Li is awesome
<TuxOtaku> Little Dragon is good too
<Spose> Parasprites must DIE
<ValtheJean> we're bronies, we never let one of our own fall ;)
<JackiePie> I was going to see her in concert, then found out they sold the tickets in June
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Anyway, we are off track, back to story)
<JackiePie> Like who the heck sells tickets that bloody early?
<TuxOtaku> lol
<TuxOtaku> Deadmau5
<JackiePie> The concert wasn't even until fall
<Spose> The number 1 is my enemy today.
<MirthTinker> 13I...don't think I'm ready to accept that, I haven't seen anything to show the contrary.
<TuxOtaku> he started selling tickets for his Toronto show in November at the start of summer
<JackiePie> I saw Deadmau5 on an MTV Music Awards
*Fluttershy 9looks up, then back down. "What if I disappeared permanently...?" Fluttershy teared up at the thought, but her expression was serious and full of sadness and anger.
*MirthTinker 13brushes the chain aside, trying to sit up with her wings still pinned
<Bpendragon> welp go I must
<TuxOtaku> I really wanna go see him in Nov.
<RainbowDashCancel> Oh no!
<Spose> First my DLC won't work because it won't download past 1%, then my demo won't install past 1%
<RainbowDashCancel> Before Lyra becomes cry Lyra
<JackiePie> At first I was confused as to why there were Mickey Mouse ears showing up on MTV
<SuperBrony64> Looking forward to also seeing the new season of The Office
<Silvermane> 15(mirthtinker, i got off of you and put the chain back on. )
<TuxOtaku> lol
<RainbowDashCancel> Somebody go fetch that cake
<Silvermane> 15(like, a while ago)
<Xiagu> heyy, somepony go find that comic of sadlyra in episode 1
<MirthTinker> 13(oh)
<DecapKing> 4that would be something no pony should ever want to do
<RainbowDashCancel> the one that's hidden behind secutity at Aperture labs
<RainbowDashCancel> *security
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, since you mentioned that you like Royksopp...I'm doing a PMV involving their tune "Happy Up Here"
*DeniedExistenceMobile hugs Fluttershy harder.
<JackiePie> Nice, by like them though, I meant I saw the video for one of their songs ages ago and liked it.
*MirthTinker 13sat up, brushing the chain aside and walking towards the door. "When you're /really/ sorry and ready to apologize, you'll know where I am. Until then, don't talk to me."
<JackiePie> Not I listen to their music all the time like them
*DeniedExistenceMobile gained +7 to hugz.
<DecapKing> 4i mean, it will hurt at first, but it will only be able to go as you live your life
<TuxOtaku> ahh ok
*Silvermane 15nodded meekly. "I understand. It'll take time to prove to you that nothing happened, and that nothing was happening. I'm sorry, i truly... *pant* am..."
<TuxOtaku> I'm a big fan of theirs
<TuxOtaku> have been since about 2000 or so
<Suffuri> bleep bloop
<Luna> 07blib
*Silvermane 15starts gasping for breath, suddenly breaking out into a cold sweat.
<Suffuri> >:( Bloop.
<RobotPinkie> I'm looking forward to bleeping the bloop
<JackiePie> Maybe I heard about them because Remind Me was used in a Geico ad
<GrimGallop> 0What's all this bleeping and blooping about? You kids and your new-fangled gadgets!
<Suffuri> @Pony who will murder RobotPinkie?
<DecapKing> 4all you can really do is just move along
<TuxOtaku> heh, Happy Up Here is being used right now in a series of ads for Bell Canada
<Suffuri> wayto not work... grr.
<VioletVanilla> 6I know overall, being in music, it always feels like there is someone better; Someone to replace you in fame or skill, and then you are left in the dark to pick up the pieces and have to work harder and harder to assure others of who you are.
<RobotPinkie> that's not very nice, Suffuri :(
<Spose> Okay. I'm going to man up and punch my internet in its face till it works. Its what MLP taught me to do.
<TuxOtaku> first heard of them on this mix CD someone gave me
<Spose> !moon
*MirthTinker 13recognized the tin that was still out. "You know what? You brought this on yourself with that addiction of yours. I told you about that cola and what it does to you, you'll find no sympathy from me now." Her cutie mark shimmers, then dulls, the pink streak in her hair turning grey.
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Spose!
<Fluttershy> I'll have to look at your crazy long doc later. >> it didn't crash my computer but it crashed my internet )
<Suffuri> we all wanted to know gwahahahaaa
<Spin> Well that was fun
<Suffuri> how do you bold names like that?
<TuxOtaku> and actually, speaking of that CD, it also had an amazing remix of Goldfrapp's Utopia on it
<RobotPinkie> you... did? :O
<DecapKing> 4(do you need me to redo what i said?)
<TuxOtaku> like a really cool deep house remix
<Suffuri> yeah last time it said Pinkie Pie
<Fluttershy> yes please )
<SuperBrony64> Pinkie can't be murdered :O
<TuxRug> If I could do flash /and/ was better with video editors, I'd follow through on an idea for a PMV featuring Spike and a ponified *nsync.
<TuxRug> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, TuxRug!
<DecapKing> 4that would be something no pony should ever want to do
*DeniedExistenceMobile feels a cold chill run down his spine...
<DecapKing> 4i mean, it will hurt at first, but it will only be able to go as you live your life
<MirthTinker> 13(I should really split it into a series of docs)
<SuperBrony64> But on an TOALLY RELATED topic
<DecapKing> 4all you can really do is just move along
<TuxOtaku> TuxRug, yeah I wish I had animation skills
<roushguy> I don't get it
<TuxOtaku> that would make this PMV I'm doing SO much easier
*DeniedExistenceMobile gets up.
<SuperBrony64> I hope they reveal who Scootaloo is related to in Season 2
<TuxOtaku> as it is, I dunno that I can even pull it off at all
<roushguy> Why did Derpy kick you?
<Suffuri> should be obvious
<GrimGallop> 0Reeeeally?
<RobotPinkie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s
<VioletVanilla> 6but as Val said, we will not leave you in the dark! We have light and will shine it. (:
*Silvermane 15flopped to the beds surface, shivering. Between pained gasps, "Just. Go. I'll be. Fine. *gurk* So. Sorry. Tink. *whimper*"
<CogWeaver> because he went !moon
<CogWeaver> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, ^Stargazer!
<CogWeaver> OH CRAP
<TuxRug> The flash skills are needed for some of the lip syncing and also because I want spike to dance with nsync
<JackiePie> Tux I always loved this album cover by Royksopp
<JackiePie> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TheUnderstanding.jpg
<SuperBrony64> No...it isn't
<CogWeaver> whoops!
*VioletVanilla feels like Twilight Sparkle all of the sudden. o.o
<DecapKing> 4something wrong Denied?
*DeniedExistenceMobile moves towards the landing.
<CogWeaver> forgot that it goes routlett mode on us mods if we just type !moon
*GrimGallop 0facehoofs
*Fluttershy lowered her voice to a whisper. "I'm a bad, bad pony... I just know it."
<CogWeaver> .__.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Yeah...just this /weird/ feeling.
<roushguy> Huh?
<Octavia> 13Hmm, still not sure where I know this tune from...
<RobotPinkie> Scootaloo is related to Fluttershy's chickens, of coure.
<TuxOtaku> TuxRug, yeah same as with my PMV....I wanted the ponies to lipsync the vocals in the song
<Suffuri> unnamed background pony #7 (pegasus) from the Sonic Rainboom episode and the unnamed background pony #42 from the running of the leaves.
<DecapKing> 4no you arent, never say that, you are one of the nicest, most caring ponies i have ever met
*Fluttershy 9looks up, her eyes dull. "What's going on...?"
<Suffuri> thats why she cant fly and all
<JackiePie> Ah that's the video I saw, it was for What Else Is There
<Suffuri> inferior genes
<DecapKing> 4im not sure
<TuxOtaku> ooh! good tune that
<VioletVanilla> 6For that one video?
*MirthTinker 13looks at him levelly, then nods. "Whatever you say Silvermane, you've always been the best at communicating when things are wrong." She cut her words off with a glare that could cut steel before walking out the door. Looking over her shoulder she added, "I'll send a doctor over later, if I feel like it."
<TuxRug> That and the dancing... I think it would be really awesome for spike to pull off some of nsync's rediculously impressive choreography
*DeniedExistenceMobile starts up the stairs.
<DecapKing> 4i wouldnt worry about it now
<SuperBrony64> She CAN fly though...:P
<RobotPinkie> She can scoot, anyway
<Suffuri> I love her scooter skills.
<JackiePie> I think it's just rediculous choreography
*Fluttershy 9pushes herself up shakily, watching DE go up with a unreadable expression.
<GrimGallop> 0Brb~
*Silvermane 15curls up in pain, mind racing as to what could have caused this sudden reaction. A trail of tears leaks from his eyes, a mix of pain and sorrow. 'Dammit... this is a stimulant... it shouldn't be able... to cause this kind... of a reaction in me... GAH'
<GRRM> well I enjoyed the episodes I've seen
<Fluttershy> 9Confound you ponies... >< my weakness is rp... I'll never be able to leave now... )
<SuperBrony64> k
<GRRM> have a good night
<TuxOtaku> well, with my PMV, it would have random stock shots of urban architecture like billboards and LED signs and the ponies would show up on them and occasionally lipsync the refrain in the song
<JackiePie> night
*DecapKing 4ears perk up as he hears a scream of pain
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Muahahahaha)
<Silvermane> 15(good, cuz I need sleep. that means you'll be here when i come back. woot)
<SuperBrony64> If people still don't know, Scootaloo is NOT related to Rainbow Dash
<DecapKing> 4stay here
<Octavia> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HjLN1TA3bc
<Octavia> 13This one.
<Suffuri> well thats a given
<JackiePie> The strange thing about this video for What Else is There Tux, is the woman keeps dripping some weird white stuff out of the bottom of her jeans
<TuxOtaku> among other ideas.
<Octavia> 13I know that tune from somewhere.
*DecapKing 4runs upstairs to Silvermane's apartment
<Suffuri> Rainbow Dash's parents died in the Rainbow Factory
*MirthTinker 13is already out of the building, her wings beating obstinately in the air, still shaking but firmed by her twisted resolve.
<Octavia> 13Probably from a million other remixs. lol
<Suffuri> according to my fanfic I haven't wrote yet...
<TuxOtaku> yeah their videos tend to get pretty abstract
<SuperBrony64> That would be an interesting take on it
<SuperBrony64> haha
<JackiePie> I like surrealism
<JackiePie> It's very dream like
<RobotPinkie> In a shocking twist, it turns out Scootaloo is Dash's daughter
*DeniedExistenceMobile enters Silvermane's room, his eyes going to the open window.
<SuperBrony64> I actually believe Scootaloo is related to Princess Celestia
<Suffuri> Its a soul collector... thats why rainbow's mane is rainbow colored.
<TuxOtaku> you ever seen any of Chris Cunningham's work?
*Fluttershy 9is overcome with dreadful curiosity though, and soon she rushes up as well and into Silvermane 's room, eyes widening. "Silvermane! What... what happened...?"
<Suffuri> she was held out to be saved by her mother as she died... like a bawss.
<TuxOtaku> he does music videos for people like Aphex Twin, Bjork and Squarepusher
*DecapKing 4rushes to the door and looks into the room
<JackiePie> I believe so didn't he do the video Rubber Johnny for Aphex Twin?
<TuxOtaku> yep
<SuperBrony64> Scootaloo doesn't know it though, because Princess Celestia is her aunt
<JackiePie> I'm a huge Bjork fan
<DecapKing> 4oh god
<DeniedExistenceMobile> /The spell should last for like 2-3 days//
*ReticentSmolder 7hears the commotion outside, peaking out his door. He sees Silvermane spasming on the bed and hurries to his lectern, scribbling a note addressed to his brother and sending it in a puff of smoke.
<SuperBrony64> I'm willing to bet anything that's what is going to happen
<TuxRug> I keep laughing at the idea of Spike singing this to Rarity and pulling off some of those dance moves.
<TuxRug> http://yhoo.it/o4swcK
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Oh god tink
<SuperBrony64> Or mother for all I know
<TuxOtaku> I like to think of his style as biopunk surrealism
*DecapKing 4rushes over to Silvermane
<JackiePie> The singer of Royskopp are they Icelandic too, because the accent sounds similar to Bjork's
*DeniedExistenceMobile flies out the window into the dark night.
<TuxRug> And Justin Timberlake's voice kinda fits Spike anyway lol
<DecapKing> 4shit, shit shit shit shit
<MirthTinker> 13(I'm suffering from CMIS right now)
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, swedish actually
<Pizzicato> I wanna see Louis CK be the new voice of Spike
<TuxOtaku> or no sorry, Norwegian
<Pizzicato> And Spike gets Louis CKs sense of humour
<Silvermane> 15(crazy mare... something syndrome?)
<Suffuri> meh
<Suffuri> whatevski
<Pizzicato> And they let Louis CK improv all of Spikes dialogue.
<TuxOtaku> nah
<DecapKing> 4Silver, please dont tell me you used that stimulant that i had given you
<TuxOtaku> Louis CK curses too much
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Instability syndrome?)
<JackiePie> Happy Up Here is a great song, and I've only heard like 5 seconds of it
<JackiePie> lol
<Pizzicato> That's the point.
<MirthTinker> 13cutie mark insanity syndrome, like what Pinkamena got
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Pony Space (Update Chapter 10!) (http://tinyurl.com/6j683x7)
<Pizzicato> And yea Röyksopp is Norwegian.
<JackiePie> Ah I see
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, lol I KNOW!! I freaking LOVE that tune
<TuxOtaku> best of theirs I've heard since "Poor Leno"
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (What is your mark?)
<RobotPinkie> I don't think it'll even be a plot point
<Silvermane> 15(decapKing, I'm on Cola leaves, been using them for a looooooong time. It's canon too)
<Fluttershy> 9o-o Cola leaves? )
<RainbowDashCancel> I really should be going to bed...
<Pizzicato> Yeah but ponies keep you all night.
<RobotPinkie> unless her mother was a chicken, because that would explain a lot
<Pizzicato> Every night.
<MirthTinker> 13(a queen chess piece, a red dice, and a jack)
<JackiePie> I can see why they'd use it in an ad, it's very catchy
<Pizzicato> That's why we're here.
<RainbowDashCancel> EqD is really distracting
<Pizzicato> Ponies, man.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Like cocaine I am guessing...?)
*Fluttershy 9stared at Silvermane for a moment longer, but she couldn't stop herself from rushing over, tears falling from her eyes. "Silvermane... I'm so sorry..."
<Silvermane> 15(stimulant, high-caffeine dosage, chemically addictive with repeated use)
<RainbowDashCancel> more so than any social network whatever, ever
<SuperBrony64> Damn, Safari...
<RainbowDashCancel> more so than reddit
<Pizzicato> Yeah dude ponies mess you up.
<TuxOtaku> JackiePie, yeah, has a really neat dreamy quality...a lot of their stuff does
<Pizzicato> Go a few days without 'em
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Special talent mirth?)
<Pizzicato> You'll get like, pony withdrawal.
<SuperBrony64> Anyway, it does say that Scootaloo is the younger sister of Cheerilee in G3
<JackiePie> Well referencing old video games, you can't go wrong with that.
<Pizzicato> I need at least one pony hit ever 12 hours.
<TuxOtaku> hehe yup
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (heck, we need like a list)
<Silvermane> 15(moderately fictional as they used Kola Nuts, not the leaves, but it works better for us to make it leaves)
<Fluttershy> 9oooh! Kinda like my chocolate covered coffee beans? )
<Pizzicato> I've had to fill my MP3 player with pony music to get my hits on the road.
<MirthTinker> 13(special talent is making toys and clockwork, bringing joy to children, that kind of stuff)
<RobotPinkie> oooh, Torchwood crossover again? Awesome.
<Sockwear_Moon> I see ponies in my sleep. I even see ponies in my games.
<SuperBrony64> Damn, this keeps refreshing
<DecapKing> 4Silver, have you been using cola leaves again?
<TuxOtaku> omg I just had an awesome idea for another PMV
<AlphaOmega> My Ipod has Ponys and Goon show
*DeniedExistenceMobile speeds up, gaining on MirthTinker again.
<AlphaOmega> and thats it
<Silvermane> 15(kinda. read the logs, see interesting... results of his usage during testosterone-high)
<TuxOtaku> who here has seen Mad Men?
<RainbowDashCancel> I've visited this site so much that my definition for the acronym ED has changed from the less-appropriate one to Equestria Daily
<ReticentSmolder> 7(Silvermane and I have tossed the idea of a shipping catalog about, with character bios for reference)
<SuperBrony64> Backing up to an hour or so ago
<Pizzicato> Haha.
<RainbowDashCancel> which I guess is a good thing
<Pizzicato> You can say erectile dysfunction, d00d.
<TuxOtaku> I'm gonna use the original RJD2 tune with Spike doing Aceyalone's vocals
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Mirth! Slow down!
<SuperBrony64> But the hell is a stream within a stream?!
<Fluttershy> 9Silvermane: kinda waiting on a post from you o-o )
<Fluttershy> 9Hmm I have a deep dark secret everypony...)
<RainbowDashCancel> Oh, god, hahaha
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Sounds good RS)
<RainbowDashCancel> seeing those commercials on TV will never be the same
*Silvermane 15mutters something, mind still racing behind his blanked eyes. 'Bastard cut my leaves with coca... not even an illicit drug... trying to kill me... Tinker is never going to trust me...'
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Oh?)
<SuperBrony64> The answer better not be "a river"
<Sockwear_Moon> Ponies on my desktop. I see ponies. I read ponies. I dream ponies. Think I'm an addict. :P
<DecapKing> 4shit
<GrimGallop> 0It's when Luna shows what Fluttershy is doing during the stream, obviously.
<TuxOtaku> and have pony silhouettes falling from the sky like in the Mad Men open
<Pizzicato> I don't dream ponies.
<DecapKing> 4Fluttershy, go and get some water
*MirthTinker 13glances back to see DE, narrowing her eyes. She fakes a left and darts into an alleyway to the right, disappearing from sight.
<Pizzicato> But I don't remember my dreams
<TuxOtaku> I need to find someone who knows flash dammit!
<Pizzicato> So maybe I do.
<RainbowDashCancel> "I'm a man, I'm 50, and I have ED. Join millions of other Americans who also have ED!"
<SuperBrony64> Define "stream"
<Pizzicato> Ha.
<RobotPinkie> it's a joke, it's just when one streamer points their browser to someone else's video stream
*Fluttershy 9bites her lip, but nods and rushes out of the room, coming back a little later with a bucket of water in her mouth.
*GrimGallop 0points left
*DecapKing 4reaches into his bag and pulls out a syringe
<RainbowDashCancel> Now think about the acronym out of context
<Pizzicato> I mean let's be honest, you don't need to have ED to use those pills.
<TuxOtaku> I may just post an ad on craigslist
<DecapKing> 4this should help
<Pizzicato> Join the millions of people who use these pills, WINK.
*DeniedExistenceMobile swings high, pulling over the rows of buildings, searching the ground for movement.
<SuperBrony64> *scratches head*
<TuxRug> I actually dreamt about Applejack dreaming about Rainbow dying. Went into the first part of a fanfic I'm working on (Sequel to Shattered Rainbow)
<SuperBrony64> Haha...?
*DecapKing 4injects the contents of the syringe into Silvermane
<TuxRug> So yeah, pony dream within a pony dream
<Pizzicato> TuxOtaku: If you want someone to do something you want to do, well, I mean, that's commercialism. That's how that industry started. You're gonna have to pay for that.
<roushguy> That would be interesting.
<TuxOtaku> TuxOtaku, Ponyception?
<GrimGallop> 0Stream = live online broadcast
<Xiagu> bwaaaaauuuuummmm
*DeniedExistenceMobile sees the flutter of wings, diving low and returning onto MirthTinker's tail.
*HaysforPonies has dreamed of being in an insane Vinyl Scratch rave party. Only to get a headache when waking up.
<RainbowDashCancel> I wanna see someone try Pokemon Inception
<BlacklightWorking> I was pinged in here, but it's gone off my scrollback, so please resend it
*Fluttershy 9flinches as she watches, starting to hyperventilate. "It's my fault... he's going to die and it's my fault..." she whimpered.
<TuxRug> did you just ping youself, TuxOtaku ?
<TuxOtaku> grrr
<TuxOtaku> TuxRug, you need to rethink your name
<TuxOtaku> lol
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Mirth! Stop for gods sakes!
<TuxOtaku> mine is already registered on this network
<DecapKing> 4no it isnt
<TuxOtaku> has been for years
<TuxRug> I've been using this for years, just not hear
<RobotPinkie> like in Inception, a dream within a dream.
<TuxOtaku> same
<TuxRug> *here
<TuxOtaku> you search my real name and this nick will invariably come up
<RainbowDashCancel> You need to settle these name disputes with an epic game of...

Side effects include aggression, exhaustion, insomnia, and irritability. Sold in grey-markets as it is frowned upon to use cola.)
<DecapKing> 4its the pony who dealt to him, thats whos fault it is
*MirthTinker 13appears slightly annoyed that she couldn't shake her pursuer, flying dangerously low to the ground and zipping between carts and ponies on the street in an attempt to confuse him.
<RainbowDashCancel> ...JAN KEN PON (Rock Paper Scissors)
<TuxOtaku> no settling.
<RainbowDashCancel> ...Okay I'm kidding.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Your going to bust yourself up! We got lucky that that wall didn't want seconds!
<TuxOtaku> I own tuxotaku.com
<TuxOtaku> lol
<Polarfire> dammit.
<RainbowDashCancel> Not sure how that would work
<TuxRug> TuxOtaku: that wouldn't happen with me, because my name is incredibly common.
<TuxRug> TuxOtaku: I own tuxrug.net

<RainbowDashCancel> Yo TuxOtaku, when you get defeated again, pick a different loadout this time. Scout, Jetpack, Active Camo, Armor Lock, whatever
<ValtheJean> photobucket! upload faster!
<Polarfire> I don't think there's anything to do about it, we'll always be 6 hours apart... So it will be your bedtime when I am just getting home from school.
<Fluttershy> 9Oh yeah, I almost forgot about my secret. o-o I'm in casual pony dress today. )
<RainbowDashCancel> Your last Hologram loadout gained a mind of its own
<RainbowDashCancel> :p
<Fluttershy> 9I mean, right now.)
<MaleficentSmolder> 4I'm here lil bro, oh dear, this looks like a caffeine overdose, hold still.
<SuperBrony64> I do like that comic

<TuxOtaku> RainbowDashCancel, you lost me there.
<Polarfire> Imma probably gonna start bringing my computer to school soon.
<SuperBrony64> The most powerful browser ever

<TuxOtaku> I'm not really a gamer.
*DecapKing 4lets Maleficent through
*DeniedExistenceMobile flies through a grocery cart, shaking off some hanging lettuce.
*Silvermane 15watches the world darken as his body puts him to sleep to numb the pain. His last thoughts are confused, wondering how he could have hurt such two important fillies, and how he could have been stupid enough to not notice the stronger stimulant leaves mixed in with his normal cola.
<RainbowDashCancel> Okay, it was a dumb Halo Reach reference. I must be in the wrong area
<TuxOtaku> yeah I haven't played halo since halo 2
*DecapKing 4goes and hugs Fluttershy in an attempt to calm her down
<TuxRug> TuxOtaku: just found your photo on your website... we could almost pass off as related.
<Polarfire> anyway.
<TuxOtaku> jesus
<Polarfire> good night guys <3
*MaleficentSmolder 4fires a spell to restrain Silvermane to the bed. Trotting forward, he examines Silvermane's condition (I'm no med student, don't push me) and attempts to calm his rapid heartrate with an anesthesia spell.
*Fluttershy 9shakes off DecapKing, lowering her head, letting choking sobs overtake her already shaking frame.
<TuxOtaku> you're freaking me out dude, lol
<TuxOtaku> I feel like I just ate some bad acid.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Mirth! I dont know how it works but I know magic doesn't work well under extreme stress! Who knows when you might change back!
<Ionnan> you know you've had too much pony when you accidentally pronouce the word "fool" as "foal" in public
<Silvermane> 15(Coca leaves: Stimulant, illicit drug. Commonly found in use by those who no longer get a reaction from weaker stimulants. Due to severe medical side effects, as many ponies are violently allergic to it, Coca is completely illegal in Equestria. Side effects include deranged thoughts, confusion, cold sweats, shaking, loss of consciousness, and vomiting.)
<Cold_in_Gardez> I'm terrified I'm going to someday say 'everypony' or some varient
<AlphaOmega> with my accent it sounds like Foal anyway
*MirthTinker 13"I. Don't. CARE!" She bucks the closest stand, tipping it over behind her and hiding behind it quickly hoping he'll pass over it.
*DecapKing 4brings Fluttershy's eyes up to his "We should probably leave and let the doctor do his work"
<TrollightSparkle> So..
<RainbowDashCancel> And now, some appropriate music for Tux and Tux
<RainbowDashCancel> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdIlP488n14
<Ionnan> I know right! I said "thank celestia once! I'm sooo glad I was by myself. Been reading way too many fan fics

<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Dark_Fawful!
*Fluttershy 9freezes, then narrows her eyes. "You... will not make me go... ANYWHERE!"
<TuxRug> barely, tux. Then again I look like everybody it seems. one of my college profs thought my ex and I were related (not even same nationality, she's hispanic, I'm completely caucasian)
*DeniedExistenceMobile scans the streets for a sign as to where MirthTinker went.
*DecapKing 4shudders as he feels a chill rush down his spine
<SuperBrony64> The comic was indeed awesome
<TuxOtaku> lol
*Fluttershy 9whispers after a moment, voice full of suppressed emotions. "Do you understand me?"
<DecapKing> 4i do
<Silvermane> 15(what's funny, is that Canon mirthtinker doesn't know that Silvermane uses cola leaves yet. She only saw the tin, but never what was inside. )
<RainbowDashCancel> Uh, yeah, class at 9, gotta get up kinda early
<RainbowDashCancel> Should probably go to sleep
<DecapKing> 4i used to be in a dark place, just like where you are now
*MaleficentSmolder 4works with a stern look on his face, his horn glowing as he scans Silvermane's vitals. After a moment, he reaches into his medical bag and levitates a syringe. Embedding it into Silver's leg, he pushes the plunger and steps back. "That's all we can do for now, he just needs to rest and relax."
<RainbowDashCancel> Maybe I'll have a pony dream
<TuxRug> Finding a recent photo is hard...
<RainbowDashCancel> Hopefully
*DeniedExistenceMobile mutter under his breath, "Dammit Mirth, I pray to Celestia that I will be there to catch you when you do...."
*Fluttershy 9turns away after a moment, lowering her head, voice still a whisper. "I'm a foal... but I still love him regardless..."
<RainbowDashCancel> To the moon!

<JackiePie> Daww, you look like a teddy bear
<RobotPinkie> it's already tempting, but that would settle the deal
<TuxRug> Is that a good thing, JackiePie ?
<JackiePie> Yes, it means you're cute
<Failure> Sweet, it's working.
<Fluttershy> 9what are you guys talking about? o-o )
<SuperBrony64> What if a My Little Pony game came out exclusively for it?

<RobotPinkie> Well, that would obviously settle it, if it's any good...

<ReticentSmolder> 7yes we do, you just don't want to admit that not using protection 3 times is a bad idea >.>

<TuxOtaku> not sure if the photo on my page has it or not...but I recently shaved off my moustache because my gf is really ticklish and would go into fits of laughter if I tried kissing her

<Luna> 07Note to self... DO IT NEXT TIME
<ValtheJean> we have a google+
<ValtheJean> ?
<Luna> 07I use my own account for it
<RobotPinkie> and i'd bet a game would be on pretty much that level
<JackiePie> That's cute
<Silvermane> 15she's just teasing me
<MirthTinker> 13oh yeah, of course, she's going to keep it a secret until she knows for sure
<Luna> 07+600 bronies in it
<Centigrade> Celestia says "my wings are so pretty!"??
<Centigrade> NARCISSISM!
<RobotPinkie> her toy does, myeah
<Fluttershy> 9sounds dramatic
<Silvermane> 15read the logs, and you'll understand it fully. (It's rated nc-17)
<RobotPinkie> it should say "Do you like mmmmmm bananas?"
<MirthTinker> 13okay, tomorrow, we show these shippers our CANON story
<LuckyCharms> lol
<Silvermane> 15indeed. I promise to take you on a real date, like a true gentlecolt
<GrimGallop> 0lol
<DecapKing> 4is it more dramatic than this story?
<Silvermane> 15no hoof blades, i swear
<Fluttershy> 9oh dear...
<Centigrade> So, you're a bee-yetch who likes mmmmm bananas?
<ValtheJean> ...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Ok, however my father is still canonic.
<Fluttershy> 9-glares at Silvermane-
<ValtheJean> mfw fluttershy's hair is the same color as pinkie's base color...
<Fluttershy> 9You... you... you....
<RobotPinkie> someone should hack a celestia toy to say that :P
<MirthTinker> 13should MrPeddington's true nature be canon? I'm pretty tempted to do that...
*Silvermane 15shuffles away from the glare
<RobotPinkie> ...and then put it back in the store
<Centigrade> they should.
<Centigrade> They really should
<Fluttershy> 9GAH!
<LuckyCharms> XD "Mommy why does she say that!?"
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Oh wait...Fluttershy doesn't know my backstory
<DecapKing> 4Silvermane? use hoof blades?
<Luna> 07if you were around during the test you should have seen enough Celestia :)
<Silvermane> 15I MEANT IN THE CANON STORY
<Silvermane> 15DON'T HURT ME
<Centigrade> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON-aaaah! BEEEEEEEEEEY-ETCH!
<Fluttershy> 9I'm sooo angry!!!
<RobotPinkie> I did, and boy were her wings pretty, Luna!
<Luna> 07hehehe yes
<MirthTinker> 13Fluttershy, you haven't come up in canon yet, but you're welcome to sit in and make an appearance
<Silvermane> 15and this, colts, is why you never juggle two fillies
<DecapKing> 4that sounds like something i would do....
*Silvermane 15owns a hoof blade, in canon. READ THE BLOODY LOGS
<RobotPinkie> lol I still kinda want that toy :P
<DecapKing> 4yeah, i know, cause im not as stupid as you Silver
*MirthTinker 13I know dear, I know
<TuxRug> Ok one of us just scared away four bronies...
<Centigrade> So, Luna (Equestria's rightful queen), Octavia, you guys are going to be live-streaming S2?
<ValtheJean> O_o
<DecapKing> 4does Fluttershy not know about DE's backstory?
<VioletVanilla> 6Pinkie looks good Val. . . Do not stop the good work. . .
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Should I tell Fluttershy my back story or let it come up in canon?
<Filter|ComesAndGoes> I blame cog
<ReticentSmolder> 7oh Fluttershy? you probably shouldn't be too jealous of Silvermane's relationship...I'll tell you about it later
<Fluttershy> 9-tears up, suddenly her anger deflating- ....
<Balloons> Yeah, i blame cog aswell.
<RobotPinkie> S2 will be live streamed here, or I will eat my hat
<CogWeaver> ...
<CogWeaver> what'd *I* do?
<ValtheJean> thanks, but shouldn't you be sleeping? O_o
*Silvermane 15breaks multiple reality molds and hugs Fluttershy. "shhh Shy-Shy I'm sorry that all this happened so fast. i wish I could have explained it to you in private, I'm sorry"
<Balloons> :)
<Centigrade> :D
<TuxOtaku> ok....I love my dog...but I'm getting sick of dog hair everywhere. I just took a bite out of a plum that I JUST TOOK OUT OF THE FRIDGE and it had dog hair on it
<LuckyCharms> Hats aren't very good for the digestion :-(
<Centigrade> Wait, you're not Luna.
<Coz> Yer also I balme him
<Filter|ComesAndGoes> If only you would let me tie you up and take you to SummerRain, this kinda thing wouldnt happen
<TuxOtaku> I was like "wtf! I wanted a plum, not a peach!"
<SuperBrony64> I will hold you to your word Pinkie
<Centigrade> OR Octavia!
<ReticentSmolder> 7no...really...when I tell you you'll shit bricks
<DecapKing> 4i wonder if i should tell my backstory.....
<Fluttershy> 9-sniffles- Darn it... you made me fall for you... hard.
*CogWeaver facehoofs* oh...you're still on THAT, Filter?
<VioletVanilla> 6I. . . just wanted to let you know that. . .
<Filter|ComesAndGoes> I totally am
<VioletVanilla> 6I am going now. . .
<ValtheJean> awwwww
<Filter|ComesAndGoes> shes gonna kill me man
<RobotPinkie> no, I'm not, but they've said they'll stream S2, so...
<ValtheJean> NOW GO TO SLEEP BEFORE I HAUNT YOUR DREAMS
<SuperBrony64> Anyone know if you can buy a season pass for Season 2 on iTunes?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I have pieced yours together Decap
<Filter|ComesAndGoes> SHES GONNA GLOMP ME TO DEATH
<Silvermane> 15*blinks* Man, I'm oblivious. I REALLY need to pay better attention... (only a minor reference to canon events there... >.> )
<Centigrade> Sorry, first time on this site.
<RobotPinkie> Don't have iTunes :(
<CogWeaver> ...
<CogWeaver> not to be rude but...
<Fluttershy> 9><

<CogWeaver> :P
<ReticentSmolder> 7okay everpony, I'm off to bed, goodnight

<TuxRug> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjBjtktLT9U&feature=player_embedded#!
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<SuperBrony64> But damn, $50
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Flutter F (Theme from Canterlot Palace Guard) [No BGM]
<Filter|ComesAndGoes> Renews his cog hunt with a fever
<RobotPinkie> I don't think it'll work on Linux
<Silvermane> 15night ReticentSmolder

<TuxRug> ^ How is Sweetie Belle bass in this?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Goodmight RD
<Centigrade> NOPE.AVI

<Luna> 07Sweet dreams Violet
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Fuuuck this keyboard
<Silvermane> 15sure Tinkerbelle

<Fluttershy> 9-sniffles- ...
<LuckyCharms> lol
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Goodnight RS**
<Centigrade> There are ways to BS itunes credit
<Silvermane> 15(hey guys, watch me create another canon reality again)
<MirthTinker> 13Fluttershy...if you want you can have him
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, appdb gives iTunes a "garbage" rating
<DecapKing> 4Fluttershy, you sound like you need a distraction
<Fluttershy> 9MirthTinker: o-o; are you for srs?
<Fluttershy> 9serious* >>
<MirthTinker> 13well, not in mane canon, but in the alternate canon perhaps
*Silvermane 15lifts Fluttershy's face up and kisses her gently
<Spyrorocks[Air]> hey Aristeo
<Silvermane> 15:D
<Centigrade> 0I love iTunes on my Mac, I skinned it and modded the hell out of it, and it's awesome now.
<SuperBrony64> Is there any other way to download MLP 'Leagally'?
<Fluttershy> 9Silvermane: player... )
<Centigrade> 0www.thepiratebay.org
<MirthTinker> 13really...he's not playing anypony, trust me
<RobotPinkie> Pretty sure it's only available on iTunes
*Fluttershy 9blinks, taking a moment to catch on, then eyes widen. "Ahh...."
<Silvermane> 15(I'm good at the field, what can i say. it's a good thing cheating of any sort is the highest sin in my book)
<TuxRug> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DSD5XV2JEA&feature=colike
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Flutter Cove
<SuperBrony64> Haha
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Sounds like a job for...*Looks around* *hangs head* *Sigh* ...the writer is forever alone...
<Centigrade> 0I've got every episode, I could upload each of them to mediafire...
<SuperBrony64> But yeah, that's the only place I've seen it
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I'm pirating it until they release a box set...
<Fluttershy> 9DeniedExistenceMobile: -pats head- )
<SuperBrony64> I don't wanna get caught pirating though :(
<MirthTinker> 13sorry DE, Ret already left :P
<TuxRug> We're losing people!
<DeniedExistenceMobile> (Me too silver)
<DeniedExistenceMobile> ....
<Fluttershy> 9I'm still really confused because I was told one thing now I'm being told another! AHHHH! )
<SuperBrony64> Especially for My Little Pony
<RobotPinkie> well, then find the eps on megaupload and such?
<DecapKing> 4i can confuse you even more
<Silvermane> 15(like I said, i created a new reality. again.)
<MirthTinker> 13should I just tell her?
<SuperBrony64> Still Pirating
<Silvermane> 15yes
<RobotPinkie> or if you use firefox, get the "youtube video downloader"
<Fluttershy> 9Oh dear...
<Centigrade> 0There were pony blurays at the local target
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Oh, he definitely /left/, Mirth.
<MirthTinker> 13okay, truth is, I'm ReticentSmolder's double, he plays multiple persona's
<RobotPinkie> you can download all the eps in 1080p in mp4 files that way
*Filter|ComesAndGoes has quit (Quit: )
<RobotPinkie> wat, Centigrade?
<MirthTinker> 13so in reality, Silver is shipping with a guy playing a filly
*Silvermane 15laughs at the sheer volume of shit-bricks we dropped upon poor Fluttershy in the course of a few hours
<Centigrade> 0Yep, MLP:FiM BluRays
<Luna> 07Alright Val
<Luna> 07time for me to leave too
<DeniedExistenceMobile> And I am really DecapKing's double
<Luna> 07it's 7:20 AM
<Fluttershy> 9o-o oh. That's it? I already caught onto that from the earlier conversation.
<DecapKing> 4eeeeyup
<DeniedExistenceMobile> No, I lied
<Fluttershy> 9That you were the double, I mean.
<Octavia> 13Everyone be leaving. Goodnight guys.
<DecapKing> 4yeah, im just a dude
<Fluttershy> 9=_=; But I couldn't be sure if you were a guy or not.
<Luna> 07Sorry.. my eyes are shutting down in auto-mode now
<Fluttershy> 9In a way... I find that... disturbing but not unbelievable.
<LuckyCharms> This room is far more active than most IRC chatrooms I've been in. There's one that has over 200 people in it and NOBODY is speaking a word, lmao XD
<Luna> 07and I need to stream tonight...
<MirthTinker> 13I get that a lot >.> even irl
<Octavia> 13Its alright Luna.
<Fluttershy> 9I've rped so many guys in the past though so...
<Fluttershy> 9Yeah.
<Fluttershy> 9o-o
<GrimGallop> 0lol
<DeniedExistenceMobile> DecapKing is not nearly as awesome a writer as me *Trollface*
<Luna> 07Octa will you post your newsletter idea whenever it's ready?
<Fluttershy> 9Guys, girls, hermaphrodites... (not even joking about the hermaphrodite part)
<DecapKing> 4want to hear the backstory i made up for this charecter using some events from my life?
<Centigrade> 0Cupcakes
<MirthTinker> 13I pull off women a little /too/ naturally at times
<DeniedExistenceMobile> *Sigh* but he gets all the ladies...
<SuperBrony64> I didn't see anything about Blu-Rays on Target's site
<Octavia> 13Eh... I'm working on it a little. But its slow going I'm afraid.
<Fluttershy> 9You're very believable MirthTinker ^^
*Silvermane 15gets ALLLLL the fillies
<SuperBrony64> Can you get caught downloading the YouTube videos?
<Luna> 07take your time dear
<ValtheJean> awwww, gnight luna
*MirthTinker 13even the fake ones
<Silvermane> 15Aeeyup :D
<Fluttershy> 9And I'm a girl in real life. o-o
*DeniedExistenceMobile has a second persona.
<ValtheJean> dream of plentiful ponies
<ValtheJean> frolicing in fields of flowers
<Centigrade> 0They were in a little kiosk in the corner, and downloading YouTube content isn't pirating.
<Luna> 07Night you two! I hope we can fix the stream tomorrow...
<Fluttershy> 9Soo...
<MirthTinker> 13yes, you mentioned that
<Octavia> 13I just... kinda want to cry. But I'm not gonna burden anyone else with my problems.
*Silvermane 15picks up Fluttershy
<Luna> 07Veemi.... :@:@!!:@
<Fluttershy> 9complicated situation became even more so
<ValtheJean> see dat? dat be aliteration :P
<Octavia> 13Goodnight Luna.
*Fluttershy 9is picked up, squeaks. o-o
<MirthTinker> 13I feel like a cheap cop-out sometimes
<GrimGallop> 0Paranoid brony is paranoid.
<DecapKing> 4my backstory involves genocide O.O
*Silvermane 15walks off into the sunset even though it's past midnight
<Luna> 07Octavia...sometimes crying is a great way to get rid of certain frustrations or emotions
<SuperBrony64> I will be paranoid
<RobotPinkie> Don't think you can get caught doing that, no
<Luna> 07Goodnight everypony
*DeniedExistenceMobile is going to make you guess, and wont tell you if it is right.
<Octavia> 13I guess so.
<LuckyCharms> Well I don't think they'd (youtube) like it but chances of you getting caught are like 0.01%
<MirthTinker> 13but I'm the result of Reticent's writer's personality, a persona of a portion of his psyche if you will
<Centigrade> 0BAI, LUNA
<LuckyCharms> night Luna
<SuperBrony64> Night Luna
<RobotPinkie> I doubt it's even illegal
<Luna> 07I see you tonight during BMN?

<Fluttershy> 9Oooh an alter ego.
<Luna> 07We have some live Fluttershy-ception again :)
<MirthTinker> 13Reticent represents one aspect of the whole, I'm the other, there's another hidden somewhere in there
<Silvermane> 15i need sleep for work. you fillies... and colts talk for a bit. I'll see yo utomorrow, fill me in on anything i miss
<RobotPinkie> Rocky Horror + True Romance? This is gonna be the best. night. ever!

<DecapKing> 4night
<Fluttershy> 9Oooh... ^^;
<Luna> 07So Rocky Horror + True romance + Fluttershy!
*Silvermane 15kisses all the fillies good night.
*DeniedExistenceMobile would only ever tell RS who his alter ego is.
<RobotPinkie> i mean srsly, 2 pony eps and those movies?
<Fluttershy> o-o my name was mentioned
<RobotPinkie> yay!
<Fluttershy> ears burn
<GrimGallop> 0What time is this going to be? I'm leaving in 11 hours and don't know when I'll be back D:

<Luna> 077 PM Eastern
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Nope
<Centigrade> 0 6 central?
*Fluttershy 9kisses Silvermane back. ^^
<RobotPinkie> It's because there will be flutterception, Fluttershy
<DecapKing> 4Dashite?
<Luna> 0717hrs:32 mins
<MirthTinker> 13(but Fluttershy, it might do Silver some good to be shipped to an actual filly, he's a little self-concious about his preference)
<LuckyCharms> you know I'm giving up my social life on a Friday night for this...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Who says my alt has been in here?
<Fluttershy> 9Brittanica is my best friend in real life ;3
*Luna did the same
<LuckyCharms> I'm just kidding, I don't have a social life :-(
<Silvermane> 15ah okay
<RobotPinkie> lol
<GrimGallop> 0So as long as we don't end up watching half a season of Slayers I should be back XD
<Centigrade> 0<countdown on the top of the page>
<Luna> 07Well everyone take care and see you later!
<Silvermane> 15i just noticed the name at the top of the name list
<RobotPinkie> later Luna!
<LuckyCharms> see ya! :-D
<Fluttershy> 9I invited her here to see randomness but randomness has to end due to needing to sleep u-u
<Centigrade> 0Don't go to sleep! Post ponies!
<GrimGallop> 0Mods are asleep. Post ponies.
<GrimGallop> 0o.O

<Brittanica> Sorry, I'm just here to watch.
<Brittanica> ^^;
<MirthTinker> 13hai hai!

<Luna> 07Goodnight everypony

<Fluttershy> 9an audience for insane rping
<RobotPinkie> I'd rather talk ponies...
<LuckyCharms> I used to but I don't really anymore.
<MirthTinker> 13oh Luna, you know you love it
<Fluttershy> 9I already kissed her xP
<LuckyCharms> and by strangers I mean friends. But they all moved away
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xOqAsGbTss
<ValtheJean> wow, the irony
<ValtheJean> I say we're always here for you
<ValtheJean> and I disconnect
<ValtheJean> sorry about that
*Silvermane 15technically kissed Luna when he kissed 'all the fillies' but who is keeping score?
<RobotPinkie> Well, I'm not much for going out drinking at all, really :P
<Octavia> 13lol Its fine Val
<LuckyCharms> well that's ok, too :-)
<DecapKing> 4me
*MirthTinker 13can't believe everypony is so attracted to their guardian deities >.>
<Brittanica> I'm super confused, just for the record.
<Centigrade> 0http://i.imgur.com/ch17G.jpg
<Silvermane> 15that's okay
<DecapKing> 4thats the point
<Silvermane> 15you'll figure it ou in time
<RobotPinkie> I mean a couple of beers from time to time... that works.
<Fluttershy> 9Silvermane...
<Brittanica> Alright. Thanks.
<LuckyCharms> yeah
<Silvermane> 15yes Shy-Shy?
<Centigrade> 0I see that Luna's still online.
*Fluttershy 9puts her hooves on Silvermane's shoulders.
<GrimGallop> 0Mods are awake. Post ponies.
<Centigrade> 0WOONA!
*MirthTinker 13wonders if she'll be needed anymore from here on out
<Silvermane> 15(oh crap...)
<DecapKing> 4MFW i somehow get involved in canon
<RobotPinkie> or if I had brony friends IRL I might do pony drinking games :P
<Centigrade> 0Mods exist, post ponies.
<Octavia> 13TF kinda line coming here, but lately I feel like...
<Silvermane> 15(of course you will. Garnet needs a mommy...)
<Octavia> 13Octavia isn't credit to team. lol
<LuckyCharms> haha, yeah
<MirthTinker> 13I could always tuck myself back into that crypt of nightmares this guy calls a brain
<LuckyCharms> That would be fun
<Centigrade> 0I've got 24 brony friends irl
<ValtheJean> D:
<ValtheJean> untrue!
<Fluttershy> 9MirthTinker: Are you an alter ego then? o-o
<MirthTinker> 13...yes?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Naw, it feels bad to keep your egos in.
<MirthTinker> 13I'm a fragment of his personality
<Fluttershy> 9MirthTinker: :3 Cool
<GrimGallop> 0I've just got the one (that I know of)
<ValtheJean> you're a delightful addition to the team
<MirthTinker> 13the cheerful self-concious side
*Fluttershy 9suddenly blushes, and lowers herself. "O-Oh, um... never mind... I..."
<ValtheJean> and we're glad to have you
<DecapKing> 4im an alter ego, mainly a manifestation of rage, depression, memories, and history
<MirthTinker> 13Ret is the jaded, cynical side
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Then what side is he?
<Octavia> 13I dunno. Everyone else is more involved or doing more. I'm not really doing anything but being here.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Ah
*Silvermane 15grabs Fluttershy, pulling her close. "What is it, Fluttershy?"
<LuckyCharms> I only know of one IRL but he moved away recently
<RobotPinkie> I have 1 potential brony friend, but we'll see about that. Haven't seen him in a while.
<Fluttershy> 9MirthTinker: Dude, I already told you I have way too many alter egos right? Boys, girls, hermaphrodites, ponies...
<ValtheJean> and being here somehow means you aren't important to the team?
<Octavia> 13...
<Octavia> 13Indeed.
<Octavia> 13I'm not a cupcake.
<Fluttershy> 9MirthTinker: Fluttershy joined in with my alter egos not that long ago. ^^
<RobotPinkie> You can pop it in your mouth whole!
<MirthTinker> 13Ret is a little closer to the whole than I am, but yeah, I'm familiar with alter egos
<LuckyCharms> lol, aw Octavia is a cupcake
<Centigrade> http://i.imgur.com/rJ3W4.jpg
<MirthTinker> 13I've played quite a few over the years
<ValtheJean> you're here, you're dedicated. You're not just sitting on your ass laughing at how gullible everyone is
<DecapKing> 4this alter ego has always been here
<Octavia> 13lol
<Silvermane> 15(James, Silvermane, Flamyras, Bloodharp, Fairith, Mortimer, Colter, Kath, Chei...)
*Fluttershy 9blushes, staring at Silvermane with wide eyes, breathing shakily. "I... oh my..."
<GrimGallop> 0Well, doesn't she look happy? ^_^
<Octavia> 13Rainbow Dash always dresses in style?
<Luna> 07Octa.. we promoted you to teamleader for a reason
<TuxRug> Omg LOL!
<Centigrade> NO.
<Luna> 07we have faith in you
<TuxRug> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6KScFGXiJk&feature=related
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Fluttershy screams more inappropriate things
<Luna> 07and now i'm leaving
*Silvermane 15blushes in return when he realizes his wings are unfurled. "Just say it"
<ValtheJean> gnight luna
<ValtheJean> see you tomorrow
<Luna> 07again...
<Luna> 07see you tonight!
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I am a manifestation of lonelyness, sadness, depression, but also hope, kindness, loyalty, and empathy.
<Octavia> 13Thanks Luna.
<Octavia> 13Goodnight Luna.
<MirthTinker> 13okay, I'm hitting the hay, let me say goodnight to Silvermane and I'll let you have your fun~
*Fluttershy 9blushes more deeply herself. "C-Can I kiss you...?"

<MirthTinker> 13and shipper devolved into gustas and nights

<Caramel> oh really? nice
<Fluttershy> 9-bites her lip- ... Hmm...
<Fluttershy> 9I'm thinking about it...
<DeniedExistenceMobile> You cannot escape the black hole of shipping Mirth.
<Dashite> No.
<Fluttershy> 9But I'm a possessive one. >>
<Caramel> I wasn't on very good terms with my choir director my senior year
<Fluttershy> 9As long as I get my own lovely canon...?
<Caramel> so I didn't get to sing :P
<SuperBrony64> lulz
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZKfcT1nQ-s
<Dashite> Fight! Fight! Fight!
<MirthTinker> 13okay, I'll just have to split off another persona and ship with it :P
<VioletVanilla> 6i am sorry
*DeniedExistenceMobile is always canon.
<Caramel> eh, don't be
*Dashite is always cannon.
<DecapKing> 4Sexy Fight! Sexy Fight!
<Caramel> she was a total bitch
<Fluttershy> 9is Silvermane bi perchance?
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Oh dashite
<MirthTinker> 13no, he's stated that clearly
<VioletVanilla> 6was it braeburn?
<Caramel> I'd gladly choose not being able to sing over having to suck up to that life-sucking vampire
*DecapKing 4isnt always canon, but when he is, he is a degenerate
<Caramel> ...braeburn?
<Fluttershy> 9Yet he's willing to rp with a guy pretending to be a filly? o-o oh dear.
<Fluttershy> 9No buttsex...
<MirthTinker> 13...yeah...I know its weird
<VioletVanilla> 6what?
<Dashite> No secret butt fun.
<DeniedExistenceMobile> And yet he can still be shipped with anyone....
*Caramel is confused
<VioletVanilla> 6oh i thought you said something
<MirthTinker> 13its really less awkward when you consider that after awhile, people forget I'm a guy
<DeniedExistenceMobile> -_-'
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I dont
<VioletVanilla> 6i said i am sorry
<DecapKing> 4MIRTHTINKER Y AM I NO CANON?
<Fluttershy> 9I thought you were a girl at fist so my perception is that you're feminine
<Fluttershy> 9It's okay ^^
<VioletVanilla> 6you could not sing
<MirthTinker> 13:(...wait :) for good rp? I can't decide
*DeniedExistenceMobile is in fact a dude.
<Caramel> appreciated
<MirthTinker> 13:):(;)
<Kraps> how would i list all of eqds fanfics by rating?
<MirthTinker> 13there
<Caramel> though I'm not too upset about it
*DecapKing 4is a 16 year old dude
<DeniedExistenceMobile> /
<Fluttershy> 9Well, let's see... Silvermane has his canon with you, yes? And I want a canon with him too...
<Caramel> I really hated that school
*Dashite is, in fact, not a pony.
<TrollightSparkle> Oh wow.. everyone left.
<HaysforPonies> There is no way.
<Fluttershy> 9Something dramatic anyway. Perhaps a split off of your canon, who knows?
<Caramel> they canceled the school musical TWO YEARS in a row
<DecapKing> 4OMG YOU ARENT DASHITE?!?!?!
<TrollightSparkle> Well except for you Super
<SuperBrony64> Everyone got eaten
<HaysforPonies> You just check it by star category
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Naw really Dashite?
<TrollightSparkle> O_O
<MirthTinker> 13you can have a canon where we're just friends who know each other
<Fluttershy> 9Then we're going to have yet another storyline, non-canon probably, in which we engage with Silvermane both in multiple 3somes.
<VioletVanilla> 6terrible. . .
<Dashite> I know DeniedExistenceMobile. I can't go on lying to you guys any more.
<VioletVanilla> 6just like pies
<MirthTinker> 13(which was the premise of the first canon)
<Fluttershy> 9o-o
<Caramel> yeah, she was a terrible choir teacher
<TrollightSparkle> Meet my other identity!
<SuperBrony64> Hmm...I forgot what I was going to say...
<VioletVanilla> 6or cakes i can remebre
<SuperBrony64> Okay
<Caramel> never ONCE taught us music theory
<DeniedExistenceMobile> Sounds like /somepony/ has a crush on Silvermane.
*Caramel has no idea what you're talking about lol
<TrollightSparkle> Oh never mind, IRC isn't working.
<Fluttershy> 9I guess we'll figure out details for tomorrow...
<Leika> Can't wait for the next Cross and Arrow fic...
<VioletVanilla> 6must be punsihed
<MirthTinker> 13...so many *thumps* of Silvermane fainting would be heard when he reads this
<SuperBrony64> haha
<Fluttershy> 9I mean. details tomorrow blegh
<Fluttershy> 9I need sleep.

<VioletVanilla> 6??
<TuxRug> Leika: that one as good as I hear? I usually stick with oneshots
<Dashite> Oh Silvermane! Twins!

<Fluttershy> 9So, three storylines it sounds like it's going to be
<MirthTinker> 13hehe, probably
<Fluttershy> 9Fun times
<DecapKing> 4make me canon, he will faint
<Fluttershy> 9Do you want me to try to hop into your canon at all MirthTinker?
<Caramel> my head's too jarbled right now...lol
<SuperBrony64> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFVbzDu55Q

<ValtheJean> I tink ebewwyone has gone to sweep
<ValtheJean> good night my widdle mods
<ValtheJean> sweep well, and dweam of ponies
<BillyColt> Man
<TuxRug> BlacklightWorking: because Applebloom doesn't get that her cutie mark will be something she's good at, thus she keeps doing random stuff with the CMCs
<BillyColt> Just got done with a MASSIVE power outage.
<BlacklightWorking> …oh!
<BlacklightWorking> *facehoof*
<DecapKing> O.O
<TrollightSparkle> I'm going now.. good night to you all.
<DecapKing> its 1 am and Molestia isnt out yet.....
<SuperBrony64> What about Molestia?
<TuxRug> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdXk9ndu9_Y&feature=related
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<DerpyBot> I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
<TuxRug> huh?
<TuxRug> What does that mean?
*roushguy blinks.
<TuxRug> meanwhile /me tries to figure out some things to add to his next fanfic.
<TuxRug> I know /what/ to add, just not what to add...
<JackiePie> http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2011/08/31/how-to-make-a-transparent-mouse-with-a-few-simple-ingredients/
<JackiePie> Mice rejoice! Cats do not.
<SuperBrony64> Uggh...I'm tired and hungry -_-
<JackiePie> Hi Disk
<SuperBrony64> nvm, I guess I'm alone >_>
<JackiePie> I had just posted a link to a Discovery article about how they can create transparent mice
<JackiePie> Cats are not very happy.
<SuperBrony64> Good night to whoever is here!
*SuperBrony64 falls asleep
<Marshmelon> !seen Sidestroke
<DerpyBot> Marshmelon: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. Sidestroke is in the channel.
<Marshmelon> !seen Lordlyhour
<DerpyBot> Marshmelon: The last time I saw Lordlyhour was Fri 09 Sep 2011 01:39:43 AM CEST
<Sidestroke> Hmm?
<Marshmelon> Anypony want to play mafia?
<Marshmelon> Sidestroke: Epicmafia.com
<Marshmelon> I have a game I"m about to run, if you have an account.
*Sidestroke is really pretty tired right now, not sure if it's a good idea
<Marshmelon> kk
<Marshmelon> They're fast, chat-based games
<Marshmelon> Octavia!
*Marshmelon brohoofs Octavia.
<Thorinair> http://imageshack.us/g/508/20110909081452.png/
*TuxRug is trying to think of something mean Applejack has done. Closest I can find is poor sportsmareship in Fall Weather Friends
<TuxRug> Kraps got a fanfare for quitting... (perfect timing with what I was watching)
<MeteorVenture> i'd play super brony 64
<JackiePie> Hi
<Marshmelon> *bye
<Marshmelon> (Fixed that for you
<JackiePie> Hulk Hoagan's having a show with little people wrestlers
<JackiePie> I try not to, but I just can't help myself from thinking "awwww cuuutee!"
<Marshmelon> sigh
<Marshmelon> I know that feeling, unfortunately
<TuxRug> Marshmelon: I read that in Applejack's voice.
<JackiePie> Yeah you know they'd probably find it demeaning, but they're just so tiny
<Marshmelon> ._.
<JackiePie> Now the countdown begins, till they are parodied on South Park
<Marshmelon> 9__9
<RainbowDash> !S2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 8d:06h:27m:33s
<JackiePie> The thing Marshmelon is one of the little people wrestlers, looks Goth. I'm thinking "Hmm, I might hit that"
<Iks> you know what would be funny... applejacks parents coming back to the farm in season 2
<Iks> that will screw up the fandom so much
<TuxRug> Iks: why is that?
<roushguy> Yes, Iks, why is that?
<GGgala> Dashite!
<Iks> dunno... cause in every fanfic about applejack her parents are dead
<TuxRug> I have never seen a dead Applejack parent, and I read mostly sads and darks.
<Dashite> WHERE MY OP, BITCH?!
<roushguy> While we're on the topic of sad
<roushguy> Who wrote Bittersweet and who wrote Pretty in Pink?
<roushguy> Those two stories made me flat-out bawl
<TuxRug> Iks: they could fix that by making them zmobies
<TuxRug> roushguy: Pretty in Pink was a tear-jerker
<TuxRug> It freaked me out when the nurse started badgering Twi.. I literally whispered (unabbreviated) "wtf?"
<roushguy> Tux, I BAWLED my EYES out.
<TuxRug> I was at that point near the end.
<roushguy> I haven't cried since my great-grandmother's funeral years ago
<HaysforPonies> I don't think I ever cried to anything reading. Just got a sore gut or gloomy mood for the day.
<roushguy> That happened to me for the rest of the day
<roushguy> And all that night too
<roushguy> Fortunately
<roushguy> I got over it today
<Lapsus> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Lapsus!
<Lapsus> AWAY!
<TuxRug> I don't get many excuses to cry, since I'm pretty much a Pinkie Pie myself. So I really enjoy stories that make me cry, helps me get rid of the slow buildup that's too gradual to cry out normally.
<TuxRug> did I just sound emo?
<roushguy> naw
<roushguy> Sounds normal
<GGgala> Oh... you mean this op?
<roushguy> I've not cried like that since the funeral
<Unidentified20856> Contra get outanyone got a link to that image with the creators of MLP and the projects they are attached to?
<Unidentified20856> scary movei 2 etc
<TuxRug> lemme see if I can find a few of my favorite tear-jerkers... one of them is a sequel to the-fanfic-that-shall-not-be-named
<roushguy> But I do occasionally shed tears when I see animals dead or all banged up on Animal Planet or if I see sick, hurt, or dead animals IRL
<roushguy> Rocket to Insanity was far creepier than that for me
<roushguy> As was the one with Pinkamena in her dream
<TuxRug> roushguy: Can you imagine what Fluttershy would do if she saw an ASPCA commercial?
<roushguy> Melt
<GGgala> ...well that was ironic. or something.
<roushguy> And if it was Sarah Mc....w/e
<TuxRug> I think she'd end up having to have major water-damage repairs to her house, but she wouldn't be able to pay because she'd have already sent all her bits in to help the poor animals
<roushguy> She'd probably just explode into a great big cloud of tears
<roushguy> IIIIN THE aRRRRRRRRRMS offff the AAAAAAAANNNNGEEEEEEELLS
<roushguy> *bawls*
<TuxRug> roushguy: Or she'd explode into tears. Then she'd explode again... can she do that?
<roushguy> Well
<roushguy> Yes
<roushguy> And no
<roushguy> She'd explode into a cloud of feathers
<roushguy> Then there'd be a second explosion of tears
<Dashite> >_>
<TuxRug> Oh like a two-stage rocket!
<HaysforPonies> She would cry. So hard. Then people who see it will cry because she's crying.
<roushguy> Yeah
<HaysforPonies> Until the universe cries.
<roushguy> ......
<roushguy> dammit
<GGgala> <_<
<roushguy> Now I WANT to see that commercial
<Synros> ahhh wifi so bad here
<TuxRug> roushguy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gspElv1yvc
<Synros> hows everyone doing?
<TuxRug> BC SPCA instead of ASPCA, but same commercial
<JackiePie> I thought Pretty in Pink was sad, but the author really shouldn't be so hung up about a certain story which starts with a c I will not mention here.
<DashiteAlt> Dammit! Stop that!
<GGgala> ahahaha. again really?
<roushguy> Pretty in Pink was one of the saddest pieces of literature I've ever read.
<roushguy> And what made it worse was that it was very well done
<TuxRug> awww now I'm crying
<TuxRug> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p31I9YgnIeM&feature=related
<mib_hepmra> zzz
<Synros> ah
<GGgala> MFW Dashite's Skype still won't work
<JackiePie> I guess I'm pretty desensitized after watching those K-Horror films. Or maybe just fortunate enough to not know death of a close one personally
<Marshmelon> TuxRug
<Marshmelon> Is ChefSandy
<Marshmelon> A Sadfic is a good cleanser
<TuxRug> ?
<Marshmelon> No wait-- that was Apple Cider.
<Marshmelon> Fuu.
<Marshmelon> Anywya
<roushguy> The fic-that-shall-not-be-named wasn't really all that scary to me
<Marshmelon> Go find and watch Celamy.
<Marshmelon> Cupcakes was like, "Meh, it's a reaction-fic. "
<GGgala> gonna lose him again, looks like...
<Marshmelon> It wasn't a BAD fic
<roushguy> I had a dream not but last week that involved a serious discussion of philosophy with the Elder One Cthulhu
<Marshmelon> I eh'd.
<Marshmelon> TuxRug: Watch Celemy
<TuxRug> roushguy: I thought it was more sick than anything. But "A Precious Rainbow" made it better.
<JackiePie> Were his tentacles still in good shape?
<Marshmelon> It's about a little girl whose mother dies, so she gets an imaginarey firend
<JackiePie> Now that's sad
<Marshmelon> Her friend
<Marshmelon> Is there and they are great and stuff
<Marshmelon> Then the girl grows up
<Marshmelon> And as she gets her first boy-kiss
<TuxRug> Marshmelon: google has no idea what celemy is
<Marshmelon> and doesn't spend any time with Celemy any more
<Marshmelon> (try with an a, Celamy?)
<Marshmelon> Celamy dies, pretty much
<GGgala> haha, oh wow
<Dashite> That was on purpose this time.
<Marshmelon> Not in a gory way, but in a really good way that fts with the rest of the story
<Marshmelon> (Celamy explained how people die earlier in the movie)
*GGgala tilts head
<GGgala> trying to fix it?
<Dashite> Resetting name.
<TuxRug> You know what movie I rented that made me cry so much I had to run out and immediately buy it?
<roushguy> I don't know, Jackie. I had this issue with babbling to all the different parts of my personality. From Skragna Malketh, the knight, to Dranae Hastell, the antipalidan, to Kasim Hazil, the psycopathic necromancer assassin to Ciel, the pacifistic druidess, to Lesur, the drunk fighter
<Marshmelon> Something like, "You get on a bus and go to heaven and everything's real cool there" <(paraphrase)
<Marshmelon> Anyway
<Marshmelon> Now you know the plot, go watch if oyu can find
<Marshmelon> SO HARD TO FIND.
<Crainy> hell yeah
<Marshmelon> Man
<roushguy> I have a /lot/ of personality facets. I gave them all names and backgrounds to avoid their talking being able to mess with me
<Crainy> Equestria Daily is newsing some awesome pinkamena stuff lately, i love that
<Marshmelon> Sorry about coming in so late and so shortly
<Crainy> such an awesome theme:
<Crainy> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/music-giggle-at-ghosties-daks-remix.html#more
<Marshmelon> (My sinternet is gonna be gone soon, so)
<AlphaOmega> mmm coffeeee
<Marshmelon> Crainy, I"ll look at it on my wii?
<Furril> http://i.imgur.com/Y0JRF.jpg
<Marshmelon> Soon.
<Crainy> ok then
<Crainy> interestingly
<Crainy> the first thing i thought of when hearing that awesome pinkamena theme was (wait, let me look it up for you)
<Marshmelon> that...
<Marshmelon> wat
<Marshmelon> Cupcakes, you'll never guess what's inside of my-- Cucpakes?
<Synros> well im going to go lie down in my coffin, I'll check back in a bit.
<Crainy> no
<Crainy> not that
<Crainy> this:
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E28WrhpTzQA
<SurgicalArts> hey ponies
<Crainy> at 0:08, i think it sounds similar
<roushguy> Here's a good question: Does having that many different people in my head mean that I have MPD?
<Marshmelon> none of these make any sense
<Marshmelon> Everybrony in this room is CRAZY.
<Crainy> thats true
<Marshmelon> GTFO my library
<GGgala> ohh
<GGgala> you still with us then?
<Marshmelon> >:V
<Crainy> the only negative thing about that awesome pinkamena theme is the ending
<MeteorVenture> commencing listening to fluttershy's lament
<MeteorVenture> commencing the jigglin'
<SurgicalArts> I think marshmelon's been hittin the cider too hard
<Marshmelon> Danny, Why are you doing that?
<Marshmelon> Crainy--- Whaaat?
<AlphaOmega> I thought it needed more discords in it
<roushguy> Crainy, are you talking about the one where Pinkie meets Pinkamena in her dreams?
<Marshmelon> The thing you linked was a pirate
<Crainy> no...
<AlphaOmega> Its cool but it didnt reflect the discordian nature of her mind
<Crainy> im talking about this song:
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YHOyVJC3Ygg#!
<Marshmelon> you linked a pirate with a frying pan or something
<SurgicalArts> anypony else find the pinkamena tumblr strangely intriguing?
<Crainy> yeah, the melody sounds similar
<Marshmelon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E28WrhpTzQA
<AlphaOmega> Oh I do love that tumblr
<Marshmelon> you linked that first
<AlphaOmega> shes currently out cold in a mixture of liqour and self pity
<Crainy> uhm
<SurgicalArts> what?
<Crainy> what the fuck?
<Solo> Holy shit.
<BitSleep> Delicious netsplit.
<Crainy> the awesomeness of the pinkamena theme blew up the channel
<roushguy> KABLAM
<Xiagu> I did naht hit her, I did naaht. Ohi netsplit
<Efreet> oaooooooooho - netsplit is a ghost.
<roushguy> We shouldn't be talking about Pinkamena
<Solo> Xiagu: NIIICE.
<roushguy> She CLEARLY caused this
<Fireant> Netsplit strike!
<Solo> I don't think that counts as strike
<Efreet> Pinkamena's not a psychotic killer. She's a lovable crazy pony.
<Solo> I think that counts as a homerun.
<Crainy> fireant did that on purpose
<roushguy> .....
<Mason_Trowel> Wait, what?
<Fireant> Of course.
<Crainy> what Efreet said
<Mason_Trowel> What's going on?
<roushguy> You got that wrong, but
<Fireant> To have a little fun.
<roushguy> Pinkie's the lovable crazy pony
<roushguy> Pinkamena's the psycotic.
<Efreet> Pinkie's a lovable HYPER pony.
<Crainy> they are both lovable
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: the IRC channel ate something that didn't agree with it
<Solo> Mason_Trowel: Unfortunately, the IRC channel isn't one to back down from an argument, and the shouting spilled over into mainchat.
<Mason_Trowel> ...huh.
<GGgala> now where were we...
<GGgala> DASHITE!
<roushguy> ....Pinkie's also crazy.
<roushguy> She's crazy in a good way
<Crainy> you know, the main reason why i havnt changed my desktop background to something pinkie yet is because a cheerfull pinkie doest fit my mood right now and a pinkamena is too emo for me
<AlphaOmega> Pinky is Crazy, but Pinkamina is legaly Insane
<Crainy> they are both the same....
<Crainy> pinkamena is what pinkie would be if she wasnt on crack all the time
<Crainy> and if she was sad instead of happy
<Efreet> http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqvzlxx0mu1qm4yy2o1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&Expires=1315638345&Signature=P3XiIfWrwbgH5a46DYD6yBrwaQQ%3D
<Efreet> oh my
<AlphaOmega> Pinky wont even play a little prank of Fluttershy cos it would be wrong. Pinkamina would shove a plastic bag over fluttershys head and know that it is right
<Crainy> no she wouldnt
<Dashite> What?!
<MeteorVenture> dat angelic voice B:
<GGgala> ...picking up where we left off...
<GGgala> we were YELLING NAMES
<Dashite> WHERE MY OP, BITCH?!
*GGgala points down
<GGgala> Come and get it, bitch.
*GGgala smirks
<Dashite> -_-
<GGgala> hey, i think i found a bug.
<GGgala> when you ask ChanServ to add someone to an op list, like /cs aop #Bronychat add Pontang, it won't actually give the admin immediately if that nick is already in the channel. they have to leave and come back?
<GGgala> Awww.
<MeteorVenture> it was totally worth waiting till now to listen to it
<GGgala> and also, ChanServ doesn't give the channel founder +q after they identify with NickServ -- they have to identify, then leave and come back, too.
<Knowitall42> PINKIE PIE FTW
<Rodman> Needs more RD in this joint, yo
<MeteorVenture> i'm not sure whether i want this song stuck in my head or not
<Rodman> Which song?
<mib_pxyic2> wow
<mib_pxyic2> I think this is the most empty I have seen this place
<Telofy> 19 ponies is empty
<Telofy> fascinating
<Telofy> :-)

<Octavia> 13Dari isn't actually here per-se, that's just his auto script. :P
<mib_pxyic2> Oh god ghost octavia

<MeteorVenture> the song was fluttershy's lament
<MeteorVenture> for whoever is still around that wanted to know

<Boegela> I did not stab them

<Stomper_> hi
<Kabaka> Heya.
<Stomper_> whats up?
<Kabaka> Not a lot. Just checking out a new network. :-P
<Stomper_> well its good to have you here
<Stomper_> where did you hear about it?
<Kabaka> Equestria Daily's Nightly Roundup
<Kabaka> Though I've seen a few links throughout the day.
<Stomper_> well im glad the word is getting out. ill be working with the networks and such
<Kabaka> Anyway, consider me a permanent resident. I pretty much live on IRC, so I went ahead and added a ZNC account for this network.
<Kabaka> You're one of the staff here?
<Stomper_> yes i am
<Kabaka> Awesome stuff. :-)
<Stomper_> some other staff should be coming around soon lol
<Stomper_> indeed it is
<Kabaka> I run a 300+ user network, and I staff on another about twice that size.
<Stomper_> wow you must know your stuff
<Kabaka> I try.
<Awesomeshy> ohai
<Stomper_> this is another staffer
<Kabaka> If this network gains any following, I may be interested in helping out, if space is available for such. :-P
<Kabaka> I was going to offer a server (I run a hosting business), but you have way too many for this few users, already.
<ChefMKT> Who in the what now?
<Awesomeshy> well
<Awesomeshy> there was a reason why we had so many
<Awesomeshy> I'm not sure how it's all going to pan out though
<Turgle> aaaand back
<Kabaka> I'm sure it'll work out one way or another.
<Stomper_> with a hammer and nail we can make a good network! :v
<Awesomeshy> I hope so
<Stomper_> indeed we all hope so
<Awesomeshy> hey Kabaka, just so I might know, where else did you see links?
<Kabaka> I think I saw a few on Google+.
<Stomper_> word of mouth?
<Kabaka> Maybe it was Reddit. I don't remember — today (well, last night) was kind of a blur.
<Awesomeshy> Wasn't expecting that
<MetalRainbowDash> 0WAIT
<MetalRainbowDash> 0What
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Sorry I was AFK for a really long time.
<Rainbow_Dash> I just got up..
<MetalRainbowDash> 0O hi Rainbow
<MetalRainbowDash> 0!
<Stomper_> was it for some kind of pony account or just people talking?
<Kabaka> I dunno. Maybe it was something similarly-named.
<ChefMKT> IT's up on EQD
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Remember me?
<Kabaka> EqD got your name wrong
<ChefMKT> YEah
<ChefMKT> That was a major problem
<Kabaka> Yeah
<Stomper_> :|
<Rainbow_Dash> I remember seeing you last night
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<ChefMKT> Took me about 30 seconds to find out the actual irc server
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Go here
<Awesomeshy> what do they have up?
<Kabaka> bronychan.net
<Awesomeshy> lol chan
<MetalRainbowDash> 0http://mibbit.com/?channel=%23ponychat&server=irc.mibbit.net
<Turgle> LOL
<Stomper_> lol oh those ponies
<Turgle> MetalRainbowDash, stop spamming your chat room xD
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Was it not you that corrected them in the comments?
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Yer not admin. You can't scare meh.
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy said... Best Blogger Tips [Reply To This Comment]
<Kabaka> on that irc network, it's bronychat, not bronychan.
<ChefMKT> That would make logical sense
<Awesomeshy> Oh ehehe
<Awesomeshy> I forgot I put my name
<Kabaka> Haha
<ChefMKT> I should probably add this to my auto-connect
<Kabaka> It's a good thing you corrected that when you did.
<Awesomeshy> yeayh, I emailed Seth about needing some testing
<Stomper_> y we dont need peoples getting it wrong nd not coming lol
<Awesomeshy> and was smashing the F5 key until I saw something
<Kabaka> It's probably already happened. Though, honestly, there aren't as many IRC-savvy bronies as there could be.
<Stomper_> true
<Kabaka> I managed to snag 2 of them from Google+ for a #mylittlepony channel on my network, but they both were new to IRC and never came back.
<ChefMKT> I'm totally not IRC savvy at all
<FreezeFrame> We're advising you not to do it before one of the ops gives you das boot for it.
<Stomper_> well its not so hard after you fumble with it like i did for a long time
<Awesomeshy> You're lucky to have people on Google+
<Awesomeshy> No one I know will move from facebook
<Awesomeshy> :c
<Stomper_> i did but then it was really slow
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: http://kylej.name/i/1r1ZOU.png
<Awesomeshy> i jelly
<Stomper_> wow we need thems
<Kabaka> Only 10 or so people from Facebook moved to Google+
<Stomper_> give
<Kabaka> The rest are just bronies I've found the hard way.
<Stomper_> its hard to ask everypony to switch over
<Kabaka> If you add me, the only visible circle is that one. Feel free to copy it. 99% of them are definitely bronies (1% are probably just /b/tards) http://gplus.to/kabaka
<ChefMKT> Can I have those cookies?
<Kabaka> There's only 3 left. :D
<Awesomeshy> yay cookies
<Kabaka> If you live close enough, sure.
<ChefMKT> Bah
<ChefMKT> No way in hell you live near me then
<ChefMKT> No one ever does
<Kabaka> I know that feeling.
<Stomper_> i had cookie before i bowled and thought the pins were yelling at me
<ChefMKT> No you don't
<Kabaka> Sure I do
<Awesomeshy> >programmer
<ChefMKT> No you don't
<Stomper_> turned out to be the wrong alley
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: :D
<Kabaka> ChefMKT: Explain, then.
<Awesomeshy> I'm in college right now
<ChefMKT> Australia.
<Awesomeshy> majoring in software engineering
<Stomper_> im in trade school
<Kabaka> ChefMKT: Ah. Yeah. That would be a long trip.
<ChefMKT> Oh is it sharing time now?
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Ahh, awesome. :D
<ChefMKT> I'm doing my PhD in computational chemistry
<Stomper_> im going to become cop
<GGgala> hey, i'm connecting over SSL. every time i reconnect i need to approve a new self-signed SSL certificate -- is that usual?
<Kabaka> Oh, you guys do SSL? What port?
<Awesomeshy> 6697-6699
<Awesomeshy> ohai
<Kabaka> :D
<Stomper_> hi
<Kabaka> -- | [Kabaka] is using a Secure Connection
<Kabaka> Much better
<ChefMKT> Hmm
<Stomper_> welco....oh wait i already told you that lol
<Awesomeshy> yeah, Pontang was very addament about adding SSL
<Kabaka> Now you just need IPv6 support.
<Stomper_> we have IPv8 btw
<Kabaka> Why is it not in your RR?
<Stomper_> its so cool
<Kabaka> Or do you mean something else?
<Stomper_> >_>
<Kabaka> s/thing/where/
<ChefMKT> 12Do we has colours?
<Awesomeshy> 7yes
<ChefMKT> 4 We has colours
<Kabaka> :|
<Stomper_> yes!
<Awesomeshy> we even have bold
<ChefMKT> :|
<Kabaka> My eyes.
<Stomper_> we dont have flsh though
<ChefMKT> 8 Darn
<Stomper_> 6woot
<Stomper_> we have this
<ChefMKT> So much pony
<Kabaka> :| You silly fillies.
<Stomper_> silly stuff everywhere
<MetalRainbowDash> Rainbow
<MetalRainbowDash> Me admin plz?
<Rainbow_Dash> If I can
<Rainbow_Dash> I dont have owner atm either for some reason
<Rainbow_Dash> One second
<ChefMKT> Alright, I have to ask this. How many of you here are into the fanfiction
<MetalRainbowDash> 2Can I use colors?
<Stomper_> what kind?
*Kabaka raises hoof
<ChefMKT> The pony kind
<MetalRainbowDash> 11?
<Stomper_> im cool with it
<Awesomeshy> I've read Past Sins and Cupcakes
<Pinkie_Pie> Of course
<Awesomeshy> never been big into fanfictions tbh
<MetalRainbowDash> 11W.. How are you owner?
<Stomper_> i read one called Mr. handy and it ended bad :(
<MetalRainbowDash> 11:D
<ChefMKT> Mmkay then
<Pinkie_Pie> I have the channel registered
<MetalRainbowDash> 11How u do that
<Awesomeshy> and I'm pretty sure everyone's read Cupcakes
<Stomper_> no i havnt
<ChefMKT> I haven't, but I know exactly what happens so yeah
<Pinkie_Pie> Use /register #ponychat password reason
<Colgate> hey all
<MetalRainbowDash> 11k
<Pinkie_Pie> I think thats how
<Stomper_> i lived on farm that had real ponies
<ChefMKT> I've kinda made it my policy to not read any pony fanfiction, ever
<Stomper_> does that count?
<Stomper_> hi there
<Awesomeshy> ohai Colgate
<Colgate> < Colgate from #EqD/#EAD -.-
<ChefMKT> I prefer OralB myself
<Stomper_> brushing any teeth lately?
<Awesomeshy> lol ChefMKT
<Colgate> what about aquafresh?
<ChefMKT> The what now?
<Kabaka> Crest is best toothpaste.
<Stomper_> what, no love for my joke? ;;_;;
<ChefMKT> Well, Stomper
<Awesomeshy> imo Crest is best toothpaste
<Stomper_> no brushint at all is best
<ChefMKT> That joke was a bit too straight forward
*Colgate loves the brushie brushie
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: :D
<Stomper_> :(
<MeteorVenture> i want dash boots
<ChefMKT> Favourite pony, go
<Stomper_> i havnt brushed sense i graduated high school back in 83
<MetalRainbowDash> 11Wtf
<Rainbow_Dash> Dash boots?
<Stomper_> the one who can fly
<MetalRainbowDash> 11I can't register my mibbit
<ChefMKT> 83?
<Stomper_> you know the chick one
<MetalRainbowDash> 11chat thing
<Rainbow_Dash> Why not?
<MeteorVenture> indeed
<MetalRainbowDash> 11I try putting /register #ponychat <reason here>
<MetalRainbowDash> 11But it won't do anything.
<Rainbow_Dash> Also, try /cs register #ponychat reason
<ChefMKT> I'm not sure if that's being serious, a joke, or a typo
<Kabaka> All ponies are my favorites. I gave up trying to pick one.
<Awesomeshy> he's
<Rainbow_Dash> You might need to put the cs
<Awesomeshy> he's probably being serious
<Kabaka> Also, 83? wat
<MeteorVenture> read what freezeframe said
<ChefMKT> Because that'll make him like 40 something
<Awesomeshy> also yeah I'm at war with myself at favorite pony
<Stomper_> torn apart im sure
<ChefMKT> Not that there's anything wrong with that
<Awesomeshy> so every pony is best pony
<Kabaka> ^
<ChefMKT> Rarity is best pony, all other opinions are invalid
<Awesomeshy> nono
<Kabaka> :-(
<Stomper_> yep thats what the show taught me back in the 80's
<Awesomeshy> I hate rarity
<Stomper_> she gold digger
<Kabaka> That's not very pony-like of you, Awesomeshy
<MeteorVenture> ops are giving dash boots for offenses.. it's like rewarding bad behavior *looks at the majority of american parents*
<Stomper_> or a gem digger i guess
<Stomper_> ya Awesomeshy thats not very pony of you
<ChefMKT> The ones that hate Rarity tend to have Fluttershy/Rainbow Dash as their favourite from what I've seen
<Awesomeshy> ok there are some times I like her
<Awesomeshy> but for the most part she's my least favorite pony
<Stomper_> my least fav pony is the dragon
<Kabaka> What about Applejack? I'm surprised by how many people say she's their favorite.
<ChefMKT> But that's not a pony
<ChefMKT> AJ has been there since G1
<Stomper_> huh?
<Awesomeshy> What's wrong with AJ?
<ChefMKT> Not that surprising
<Stomper_> aj is pony next door
<ChefMKT> Her personality is also relatable to alot of people as weel
<Kabaka> Nothing's wrong with her. I've just noticed, among those I watch, that she's almost always considered the best. It's noticeably uneven.
<Stomper_> hot voice
<Stomper_> shes pony you take home to meet parents
<Awesomeshy> I'm probably
<Stomper_> but then parents fight and it ruins everything
<Awesomeshy> leaning more towards pinkie pie tbh
<GGgala> you also need to register your nick first...
<Stomper_> im for that one
<Stomper_> oh man i forget names
<ChefMKT> Not gonna lie, I hope season 2 lives up to the hype
<ChefMKT> I'm kinda burned out on ponies
<Awesomeshy> It has to
<Stomper_> i hope it becomes survival horror show
<Kabaka> I won't burn out in the foreseeable future.
<Awesomeshy> ^
<ChefMKT> That future may be very short
<Kabaka> Lulz
<Awesomeshy> 2012 etc
<Stomper_> IN THE YEAR 1212, WHEN MAN IS TIRED OF PONIES....
<Kabaka> 1212?
<GGgala> oh hey, so, my internet killed me for a bit after i asked about SSL earlier. Is it normal to get asked to confirm a new self-signed certificate every time i connect?
<Stomper_> oh damn
<Stomper_> i messed taht up
<GGgala> (so i missed any answers if there were any)
<MetalRainbowDash> 11It said it sent an email to my email
<Kabaka> GGgala: If they're using a self-signed cert and your client is very picky, then I suppose so.
<Awesomeshy> Might be GGgala, I've honestly only connected to the server once
<GGgala> Kabaka: no, it's a different fingerprint, every time, i checked.
<MetalRainbowDash> 11Prince Dari
<Stomper_> im a bot so idk
<GGgala> with other networks' self-signed certs it hasn't come up like this
<Kabaka> GGgala: You may be getting different servers. There are 4 client servers in a round robin.
<GGgala> yet, anyway
<Kabaka> If they all use different certs, that would happen.
<MeteorVenture> tough crowd
<Awesomeshy> that might be it
<Stomper_> ya
<GGgala> ah, yeah. they all show the same irc.bronychat.net domain though. but i guess that makes sense.
<Kabaka> If your client saves your approval, that would stop once you've connected to each.
<GGgala> it does. it has before, anyway.
<MetalRainbowDash> 0MEEGH
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Rainbow
<MetalRainbowDash> 0I still didn't get an e-mail
<Colgate> bah, this chanserv doesn't have redirect :/
<GGgala> don't think he's here right now
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Grrrrr
<Stomper_> um, whats your fav pony quote?
<Kabaka> So who actually set up the network?
<Awesomeshy> anope services, and we still need to install some modules
<Awesomeshy> Pontang did
<Awesomeshy> I funded everything
<Kabaka> Why Unreal + Anope? :-(
<ChefMKT> Stomper: Dumb fabric
<Awesomeshy> He couldn't get surreal services to work
<Kabaka> Gah, Surreal is also the wrong choice. :-P
<Awesomeshy> what would you advice?
<Kabaka> Charybdis + Atheme.
<Colgate> there are 50 different types of irc severs, have to pick one!
<Kabaka> After running a medium size network for 8 years, I've found that to be the best choice for every situation.
<MetalRainbowDash> 0deadchat :(
<Kabaka> And I'm good friends with the guy that wrote them.
<ChefMKT> Friends with benefits?
<Kabaka> I used Unreal+Anope for 4 years.
<Kabaka> Haha, almost. :-P
<ChefMKT> :3
<Kabaka> Unfortunately, he's quite resistant to the idea of ponies being okay.
<ChefMKT> Don't worry, he'll come around
<ChefMKT> They all do
<Kabaka> I think he tried making it into a drinking game a few days ago.
<Kabaka> I have no idea what happened with that.
<Awesomeshy> unfortunately, I don't think Pontang is going to be arround for the long huall, and he's the one who knows the most about irc networks on staff list
<Turgle> cool title
<Awesomeshy> ponies drinking game?
<GGgala> ohay, what's the policy on using HostServ here?
<Colgate> pony drinking games are fun :D
<MetalRainbowDash> 0-_-
<Stomper_> my face quote was by fluttershy when she said "it is always more difficult to fight against faith than against knowledge"
<Stomper_> fav
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: That's a shame. Like I said, I live on IRC, and I know Unreal and Anope inside out. If you want/need/will accept another staff member, I'm more than willing.
<ChefMKT> When the heck did she say that?
<GGgala> i get "Access denied" when i do a /hs request
<Kabaka> No custom vhost for you!
<Stomper_> it was a quoic quote and is missed easily
<Stomper_> quick
<Stomper_> my keynoard is messed up, got chewed on
<ChefMKT> Yeah, I'm pretty sure she never said that
<EspyLacopa> Awesome title is awesome
<Stomper_> no im sure i heard her say that
<Turgle> ^
<Stomper_> maybe im paraphrasing
<ChefMKT> You're going to have to quote which episode
<ChefMKT> Because I really don't recall her saying anything remotely similar to that, ever.
<Stomper_> maybe it wasnt her
<GGgala> trolling detected
<Kabaka> I'm not seeing anything like that on the transcripts on the MLP Wikia page. http://j.mp/o7oNb3
<Stomper_> maybe it was another :/
<Stomper_> no im not trolling at all
<EspyLacopa> lol
<Stomper_> im sure i heard it
<Luna> 07bah autojoin
<Kabaka> I've watched the series about a dozen times and I have no idea what you're talking about. :-\
<Awesomeshy> back
<Awesomeshy> sorry, someone was knocking on the door
<EspyLacopa> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cVpk8F614Vw/TmoGPJMhwiI/AAAAAAAAA7c/ysfU1lMkjo8/s1600/Capture.PNG <-- What am I supposed to do with this?
<Stomper_> she also said "friendship build bridges into unexplored regions"
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Wtf
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Guys
<MetalRainbowDash> 0I just got some thing saying I have a virus
<GGgala> LOL Flutterhitler
<EspyLacopa> What thing said it?
<MetalRainbowDash> 0It opened a new tab
<Stomper_> what?
<MetalRainbowDash> 0and said We will check system for you
<EspyLacopa> Sounds like a type of phishing scheme.
<Luna> 07sounds like a parapsprite
<MetalRainbowDash> 0OMG I CANT CLOSE IT
<Awesomeshy> xfd
<EspyLacopa> Use the power of Alt-F4.
<Stomper_> wait what?
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: in case you missed it, I highlighted you while you were gone
<MetalRainbowDash> 0That doesn't work either.
<Turgle> sounds like welcome to the internet
<Kabaka> Stomper_: Where are you getting those quotes from? :|
<MetalRainbowDash> 0It says
<GGgala> http://thinkexist.com/quotation/it_is_always_more_difficult_to_fight_against/338081.html
<Turgle> use Ctrl+Alt+ESC
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Download Antivirus Studio 2010 now

<Stomper_> remembering them from memory
<Kabaka> GGgala: LOL

<EspyLacopa> More removal stuff.
<MetalRainbowDash> 0It says if this has happened to u
<MetalRainbowDash> 0You've been hit by a fake scanner page
<Stomper_> sometimes
<Luna> 07What is Antivirus 2009? (Run SpyHunter's malware scanner to check for Antivirus 2009)
<Luna> 07Antivirus 2009, from the same family as Antivirus 2008 and Doctor Antivirus, is a new rogue anti-spyware application. Antivirus 2009 is installed onto your PC when visiting dubious malicious websites and is advertised through the use of Trojans. Once Antivirus 2009 is installed it will scan your PC reporting numerous fictitious infections. The purpose is to scare you into purchasing the
<Luna> 7application Antivirus 2009. An Internet Explorer browser helper object is also installed which shows fabricated alert messages. The message may state that your PC is infected or a box is added to your Google homepage falsely claiming that Google detected an infection on your computer. Your web browser will also be redirected to sites promoting the rogue program Antivirus 2009. Remove the
<MetalRainbowDash> 0and a drive-by download (downloads that occur without your concent)
<Luna> 7Antivirus 2009 infection as soon as possible.
<Pontang> Kabaka: what do you offer?
<GGgala> I don't think I want to see inside your brain man.
<Luna> 07read ^^
<Stomper_> ;;_;; how could i do that to her?!
<Turgle> seems legit
<Luna> 07lol
<MetalRainbowDash> 0XD
<EspyLacopa> When in doubt, there's always a hard shut down of the computer, disconnect the internet connection, then uninstall.
<MetalRainbowDash> 0I already have MBAm
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Gonna run it
<Luna> 07http://www.removal-instructions.com/removeAntivirus2009.html
<MetalRainbowDash> 0and scan
<Flutterhitler> I was looking for a new name :v
<Stomper_> so she didnt also say "All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.”
<Luna> 07your welcome
<Kabaka> Pontang: 8 years of IRC operator / network owning and operating experience, and 10 years of experience being a server administrator (I'm owner-operator of a web hosting company). I'm on IRC pretty much all day since I work from home on my PC. Also, potentially a new server node, though you're so far under capacity it's not even funny. And free ZNC accounts.
<GGgala> Perfect name for an admin, too! Now you've pre-Godwinned any complainers.
<Turgle> oh linux you know i love you
<Stomper_> thats not funny Flutterhitler, my grandad died in a consentration camp
<Stomper_> he had adhd
<Kabaka> Flutterhitler: LOL
<MetalRainbowDash> 0The scan was quick.
<MetalRainbowDash> 0It found 6 threats
<MetalRainbowDash> 0gonna remove them
<Kabaka> Stomper_: Really?

<Kabaka> Stomper_: Ponies are not Hitler-like in any way. :-(
<MetalRainbowDash> 0But how am I sill in the chat if it's supposed to block apps from running
<GGgala> Such word association is something I expect to see as a bizarre neurosymptom on House.
<Flutterhitler> Nightmare Moon maybe
<Kabaka> (Nobody correct me. I'm already thinking of ways I'm wrong)
<Stomper_> so rainbow dash didnt say “How fortunate for leaders that men do not think.”?
<MetalRainbowDash> 0I guess the program block trigger or whatever didn't come on.
<Stomper_> i can see her saying that
<MetalRainbowDash> 0Oh wait now it removed all threats.
<Luna> 07looks like you be busy for a while :)
<GGgala> Oh, now it's Rainbow Adolf too?

<MetalRainbowDash> 0k
<Kabaka> I think being weird comes with the territory.
<ChefMKT> No no, I'm just weird
<ChefMKT> Not crazy
<Stomper> who here is a furry that became one sfter watching this show?
<Luna> 07so I slept like 3hrs today.. yay
<Turgle> (y)
<Awesomeshy> not me
<Turgle> busy night?
<Colgate> only for ponies
<Luna> 07yea... test-stream
<Stomper> <_< oh ya not me either
<Colgate> still not a fan of anthros or any of that
<Kabaka> I've been a furry for years.
<Turgle> getting ready for next week? :D
<Luna> 07yep
<Stomper> where you live Kabaka?
<Turgle> (y)
<EspyLacopa> 8 more days
<Kabaka> Bronies have an odd misconception of what furries are, so I hate talking about that around them
<Awesomeshy> he already linked his G+
<Turgle> i'm scared about this chat
<Kabaka> Stomper: Oklahoma (USA)
<Stomper> i live in uganda
<MetalRainbowDash> K I rebooted
<Luna> 07why scared?
<Turgle> it's gonna be unreadable
<Turgle> tooooo users
<MetalRainbowDash> After removing
<Awesomeshy> Kabaka: define furry
<Stomper> and im a furry
<Awesomeshy> as in, a fan of the art, or dresses up in fursuits
<Luna> 07Well... I cant tell much :)
<MetalRainbowDash> YES ITS GONE
<Luna> 07Just wait and see
<Turgle> for sure :D
<Pontang> =x
<Luna> 07run a full scan MRD to be sure
<Stomper> well in uganda you get stoned when you wear fursuits
<MetalRainbowDash> Well it's gone.
<Stomper> and not the good kind of stoned
<MetalRainbowDash> It can come back!?!?
<Stomper> the one with stones
<Stomper> and rock
<Turgle> of course
<MetalRainbowDash> :o
<Stomper> and sometimes light cigars
<Awesomeshy> wat
<MetalRainbowDash> brb
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: I've always considered "furry" to mean "animals with human traits of some kind." In terms of the members of the furry fandom, I think that it means anyone who likes things wherein animals are given human traits.
<Kabaka> And I don't just mean making them look human. Talking animals == furries.
<Kabaka> By every definition of the word I've ever know, bronies are just a subset of furries.
<Awesomeshy> then I'd be considered a furry
<Stomper> Kabaka has it down perfectly
<Kabaka> But bronies seem to think that furry means anthro characters with definite sex involved.
<Kabaka> So this whole conversation makes me uncomfortable. :|
<Stomper> ya ive been a part of a furry group for a while and its no yiffing at all
<Kabaka> I was never in it for that stuff.
<Awesomeshy> put bluntly, I thought it was more animal people
<ChefMKT> Ooh, that reminds me
<Stomper> your around friends Kabaka
<Awesomeshy> like thundercats
<ChefMKT> Snarfy snarf?
<Awesomeshy> <3 snarf
<Pontang> If you go on the furnet, most of the channels are 18+ for a reason. >:
<Stomper> WITH THE POWWER OF ENTERNIA!
<Kabaka> FurAffinity recently released some statistics that are relevant to this discussion.
<Kabaka> The vast majority of the content on the site is not adult, and not even mature.
<Stomper> Kabaka going to furry campot this weekend with over 100 furries. its going to be biggest in uganda history
<Stomper> ya i can see kids thinking its something its not
<MetalRainbowDash> back
<Kabaka> Stomper: That's pretty cool. I didn't know you guys had anything like that down there.
<MetalRainbowDash> Have u guys heard of a video called 1 Guy 1 Jar?
<Kabaka> That's awesome :D
<Luna> 07scans running?

<Kabaka> Yeah. We should discontinue that. Everyone got quiet, and I think Pontang changed his mind about letting me help out.
*Luna does not want to know

<ChefMKT> Course not
<Stomper> no
<Awesomeshy> no
<EspyLacopa> Luna: You're the banana queen, quick put a banana in your ear!
<MetalRainbowDash> :(
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: If I do end up giving a node to the network, it will be free.
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: And potentially web site hosting as well (no promises, though).
<Stomper> because i like you ChefMKT
<Stomper> you should stick around
*DeniedExistenceMobile opebs up the present.
<ChefMKT> Most people do like me

<Stomper> he went from touhou fag to pony fag
<ChefMKT> Which is the main reason why I tend to distance myself from the pony fandom
<DeniedExistenceMobile> I have never been a little filly though!
<Pontang> xD
<Stomper> why? because its for 8 year old girls?
<Stomper> lol
*Colgate fully embraces the pony culture

<ChefMKT> When the demo of ten desires was leaked
<MetalRainbowDash> http://miburl.com/bpjSo9
<ChefMKT> Was around the same time Cutie Mark Chronicles was airing
<ChefMKT> And I was like "Nope, watching ponies"
<ChefMKT> At that point, I realised I moved onto another fandom
<Stomper> lol what a great story you have there, im the richer for hearing it

<Stomper> this is worse then out furry conversation lol

<ChefMKT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Txq4JS6WKI
<Kabaka> Stomper: Work. I work for myself. My free time is entirely full of IRC and ponies and writing software.
<EspyLacopa> Yup. I left after the pony episode that was on the Hub.
<Stomper> what kind of software?
<Turgle> how did the test go?
<Stomper> also didnt apple jacks once say "Demoralize the enemy from within by surprise, terror, sabotage, assassination. This is the war of the future."
<Turgle> i left after dr who
<MetalRainbowDash> I watched Dr. Who
<MetalRainbowDash> Hoo

<Turgle> :|
<MetalRainbowDash> God look how many people are in the chat
<MetalRainbowDash> ONly a few
<Luna> 07But we might do another test soon
<MetalRainbowDash> Yesterday it was blowing up.
<EspyLacopa> I'm sure you'll get plenty of people next saturday.
<Kabaka> Stomper: Things for my business, mostly, to be honest. Also IRC bots, things I'm contracted to write, and lately, the backend for a pony image archive (see my G+ stream for development whining on part of that).
<Turgle> that's the point i guess xD
<MetalRainbowDash> :O
<Stomper> whats your g+ again?
<Kabaka> Stomper: Really anything, though. If I need something done, I'll write something to do it for me.

<EspyLacopa> Remember those Calvin and Hobbe stripes about the things they did with the box?
<Stomper> the funny part is that i didnt ut filters on
<Turgle> CALVIN & HOBBES <3

<MetalRainbowDash> *meteor hits*
<Kabaka> It's kind of a meme in the fandom, now
<Derpieshy> hey Pontang
<ChefMKT> Yeah
<Pontang> Aye?
<ChefMKT> I was there when that happened in the voice chat
<Stomper> Pontang is not in now, please leave a threat at the end of message
<Derpieshy> can you g-line Stomper for me? I can't be bothered to
<ChefMKT> Was quite hilarious at the time
<Kabaka> First time I saw it was Wilton R on Google+.
<Kabaka> I thought it was damn clever.
<Pontang> Lol
<MetalRainbowDash> Mishka is on TV
<MetalRainbowDash> The talking husky

*MetalRainbowDash turns evil.
<Stomper> vip5 was a good game he did
<Stomper> lots a good levels
*MetalRainbowDash holds Turgle against the wall.
*MetalRainbowDash "Prepare to DIE!"
<EspyLacopa> What an end for the cardboard box.
<Turgle> oh well
<ChefMKT> I'm finding it rather alarming how many things I have in common with you
*MetalRainbowDash whacks EspyLacopa with a bat in the head
*MetalRainbowDash stabs Turgle.
<Turgle> i loved the Jurassic park reference
<Derpieshy> do you like knitting?
<ChefMKT> Honestly, I can't say I've seriously tried it
<Derpieshy> I don't
<ChefMKT> But I do enjoy the idea of keeping my hands busy
<Derpieshy> never done it
<AllisZero> Morning everypony
<Stomper> crochet
<Stomper> its better
<Luna> 07Lyra why are you so adorable
<Kabaka> I've always wanted to try knitting.

<Stomper> for hands
<ChefMKT> Starcraft 2?
<Kabaka> Some of my friends knit and love it.

<ChefMKT> Doing an LP of an RTS game is...uh
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGUuY-kl9Eg <-- Usagi Drop
<ChefMKT> Not a good idea
<Derpieshy> lol
<ChefMKT> It's the general stereotype that koreans are better than everyone else in starcraft
<Stomper> it is?
<ChefMKT> Turns out, it's true so far
<Stomper> i have never heard that
<Kabaka> A stereotype that seems true
*Kabaka slow
<ChefMKT> e.g. MLG
<ChefMKT> Top six spots were all Koreans
<Stomper> well stereotypes are based on real stuff though
<ChefMKT> Anyway
<EspyLacopa> Rin is adorable
<AllisZero> That's really well done
<prince-dari> Ok, all fixed then?
<ChefMKT> QWERTY or DVORAK?
<Stomper> i would never think korean though
<Stomper> maybe jap or welsh, but not korean
<Kabaka> Stomper: Video gaming is a sport on Korea.
<ChefMKT> Japanese is fighting games, son
<Pontang> You can try it yourself if you wish.
<Kabaka> in*
<Turgle> she's so cute
<prince-dari> I thought Starcraft was the national sport of Korea?
<ChefMKT> Yeah
<Derpieshy> fuck yeah blazblue/arcana hearts
<ChefMKT> Ehhh
<ChefMKT> Blazblue
<Derpieshy> why does everyone hate blazblue
<prince-dari> Back from school.
<ChefMKT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwdYZ7Kg4Sg This is why.
<prince-dari> >400 Skpe messages
<Turgle> wb
<prince-dari> Not as bad is it usually is.
<Stomper> i thought they liked ping pong, like in forest gump
<EspyLacopa> Working single man chooses to raise his dead grandpa's 5 year old daughter.
<Turgle> ._.
<MetalRainbowDash> Prince Dari
<MetalRainbowDash> Check my email asking for application
<MetalRainbowDash> Or Luna
<EspyLacopa> Because none of his other relatives wanted to.
<Stomper> loved that scene
<MetalRainbowDash> http://mibpaste.com/78N1cf
<MetalRainbowDash> Prince
<MetalRainbowDash> Dari
<Derpieshy> what am I watching
<Pontang> Ponytang is Mibbit@BA29AE29.C03EC38A.A9F0B7CF.IP * http://www.mibbit.com
<Derpieshy> mibbit is fixed yeah
<prince-dari> Ok MetalRainbowDash.
<ChefMKT> RElius has a dive kick
<ChefMKT> :|
*MetalRainbowDash wants prince-dari or Luna to check my email of application.
<MetalRainbowDash> k
<MetalRainbowDash> Subject is Application Pl0X?
<Kabaka> I didn't know anyone still used Mibbit after the hacking incident. :-\
<Turgle> application for what?
<ChefMKT> Oh darn
<ChefMKT> It's already 11 PM, sleep time
<prince-dari> Ok.
<MetalRainbowDash> Prince-dari
<prince-dari> Everyone still uses mibbit.
<prince-dari> It's the only good web client.
<Stomper> pffft its 630 here
<Kabaka> 8:33 AM. Almost time for dinner. :D
<MetalRainbowDash> What if I don't have a profession in school?
<Pontang> We're planning to add a flash/java applet in the future. But that is for preference.
<prince-dari> As good as a web client can be anyway.
<Kabaka> Man that's hard on the eyes
<Kabaka> Anyway, I know, there's not really many good alternatives.
<Stomper> in russia, severn ate nine
<MetalRainbowDash> Can I put it as N/A
<Pontang> Well, if you want flexibility.
<Pontang> x_x
<Kabaka> I just want no data mining and no unethical administration.
<Pontang> Yeah
<Pontang> There are other ajax clients out there.
<Kabaka> The hacking itself wasn't the problem. It was the administrative logs that came out of it.
<Kabaka> So much bad stuff revealed.
<Pontang> I see.
<Kabaka> Mibbit is banned on 7/9 of the networks I'm on.
<Stomper> wow there went the conversation lol
<Pontang> =p
<AllisZero> :|
<Kabaka> Pretty much
<Stomper> so nwyas Kabaka, what kind of work you do?
<Kabaka> Stomper: Primarily, I run a web hosting business.
<EspyLacopa> So, what are the chances that the Secret Pony Level of Diablo III is actually real?
<Stomper> oh nice
<Kabaka> Stomper: Everything you could want to know is written/linked on my G+ page.
<Luna> 07lol
<prince-dari> I think it's real, but not meant to be a reference to MLP.
<Stomper> na i ask the person instead, i like to be more one on one then go look stuff up lol
<AllisZero> Agree
<Kabaka> Haha, that's always nice.
<Turgle> that would be great anyway
<Stomper> eh it makes better conversation
<Kabaka> Of course.
<Stomper> nice tea party we have here
<prince-dari> I'm not on any networks mibbit's banned on. :P
*Luna wants a GW2 release date!
<Pontang> But, we have all the servers ready for mibbit now.
<Derpieshy> my god
*Stomper puton monocle and top hat
<Derpieshy> give me your computer setup
<prince-dari> Good.
<Stomper> QUITER!
<Kabaka> I'm betting some of the bans will be lifted after some time has passed.
<Stomper> ya hes so jelly
<prince-dari> I'll switch it over for BMN today then.
<MetalRainbowDash> Prinnce-Dari
<Derpieshy> why was mibbit banned, do you know?
<Stomper> you know any hackers Kabaka?
<MetalRainbowDash> Can I put my profession in school as N/A
<MetalRainbowDash> *prince
<prince-dari> Fine.
<Derpieshy> >_>
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: One of their servers got rooted. Loads of logs and user data (including like 10,000 [or was it 100,000?] nickserv passwords). Among the logs were Mibbit administrators talking about their unethical practices, such as working to circumvent Freenode's block.
<Michael89pl> ?invite DerpyBot
<Iks> omg Lordlyhour
<Michael89pl> :<
<Iks> you have to watch firefly
<Lordlyhour> No
<Lordlyhour> I don't
<Iks> yes!
<Iks> why not?
<Lordlyhour> I don;t care for Sci-Fi
<Michael89pl> dammit, it isn't OGN and Centravi :p
<Derpieshy> mmm
<MrPoniator> It was a sci-fi show?
<Stomper> been doing on the side surveillance for a friend and ive hit a dead end
<Leonon> Firefly isn't Sci-Fi, it's a western
<Iks> i thought it was a western/pirate series
<Leonon> that happens to be in space
<MrPoniator> Ah
<MrPoniator> I don't care for westerns
<Kabaka> Nobody really wants to trust them to obey their own privacy policy anymore.
<MeteorVenture> diablo 3 would be 20% cooler which would explain the vegetation
<Lordlyhour> I don't tend to like much TV at all
<Kabaka> One of the main admins has said they data mine for sensitive, private information, though nobody is really sure if he was telling the truth. I'd like to assume not.
<prince-dari> And that's why you should use a real client.
<Derpieshy> hey Kabaka, I can't seem to tell what OS you have in that workstation pic
<Kabaka> But this certainly didn't help.
<Lordlyhour> Come to me when Firefly is a Complete Webcomic
<Kabaka> Yeah, pretty much.
<Lordlyhour> Then I'll talk
<Lordlyhour> !s2
<MrPoniator> There are a few exceptions, but the only thing I really like about westerns are revolvers and stetsons

<prince-dari> Or most people won't bother.
<Kabaka> Definitely.

<Stomper> impressive

<Derpieshy> how long as this been
<Lordlyhour> She's visible in the show
<Derpieshy> oh shit
<Kabaka> It was in Arch repos the same day, of course.
<Leonon> she's in the Winter Wrap Up musicle number
<MrPoniator> Doesn't she just appear briefly beside Derpy, and the fanon developed there?
<Lordlyhour> But all the "She's Derpy's Daughter" and stuff are Fanon
<Kabaka> Amazingly, it didn't break anything! :D
<User_7546> Oh. gotcha.
<Kabaka> It's true.
<AllisZero> Haha that Lyra falling off the bed is cute
<OwMeGud> i hope it will be canon

<Kabaka> Colgate: inxi

<MetalRainbowDash> ok bye
<Lordlyhour> Lol.
<Colgate> this is a handy script :D
<AllisZero> Later Turgle
<Lordlyhour> Cosplaying ed
<Luna> 07later Turgle
<Kabaka> Alias: inxi => /shell -o inxi $*
<Kabaka> <3 weechat
<MetalRainbowDash> Luna
<MetalRainbowDash> I sent my application
<Kabaka> It really is
<MetalRainbowDash> But you'll probably decline it.
<Leonon> Eddy! Look at me eat this pie with my face! *facepie*
<AllisZero> ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
<Kabaka> inxi -F -x -d -u -l
<Derpieshy> :c feel left out being on fedora and all
<Kabaka> No inxi for you?
<Stomper> lol
<Derpieshy> nope
<Colgate> woah, that is a ton of info
<Stomper> sudo get out Derpieshy
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: Install from sources. :D
<EspyLacopa> Allis, I can't read your crazy moon language!
<Derpieshy> Stomper: you're using ubuntu 11.04
<Derpieshy> don't you even
<Stomper> ya and its shit
<Kabaka> Ubuntu :-(
<MetalRainbowDash> Chat is dying.
<Kabaka> I started on Fedora. I used to use it on all my servers, too.
<Kabaka> Later moved on to Debian, then Gentoo, then Ubuntu, and finally Arch
<Derpieshy> ah man
<Colgate> I started on ubuntu, then debian, then arch
<Kabaka> My servers all run CentOS >:(
<Derpieshy> I managed to install gentoo
<Stomper> i started on ubuntu then ubuntu
<Kabaka> Gentoo was _okay_, but I much prefer Arch Linux
<Kabaka> I don't think I'll ever leave.
<Derpieshy> I tried arch
<Kabaka> The package manager is damn nice
<Crainy> wee i can go home now
<Derpieshy> and everything was working fine
<Derpieshy> except
<Crainy> see you there!
<Crainy> i love you all!
<Kabaka> THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME
<Colgate> except nothing!
<Stomper> except all your 20's goto 10 and all your 10 is hell
<Derpieshy> TO BE CONTINUED
<Kabaka> Colgate: LOL
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: Nooooooooooooooooooo! </Spike>
<Derpieshy> I think I was messing up my xorg config
<Stomper> shit i thought Kabaka would get that joke
<Kabaka> That's not Arch's fault :-(
<Derpieshy> yeah
<Derpieshy> I'm not blaming arch
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMZxm-EisrQ and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfCAQRaI-Z8
<Kabaka> Stomper: I did, but Derpieshy overshadowed you
<MetalRainbowDash> Espy
<Stomper> <3 no one ever gets that joke
<MetalRainbowDash> How do you get the thumbnails to show
<Stomper> your old school for sure
<Kabaka> :D
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: Well good. :-P
<Kabaka> I'll stand by Arch through anything.
<Derpieshy> the same problem I had with Arch was what was wrong with gentoo
<Kabaka> It's not for everyone, but it's *exactly* what I need.
<Derpieshy> me
<Derpieshy> :c
<Kabaka> :-(
<Derpieshy> so I tried out fedora
<Derpieshy> and was p happy
<Stomper> this turkey wants me to try it also
<Derpieshy> it runs really well on my netbook
<Kabaka> I need something that's bleeding-edge and has a package manager that doesn't bork up the entire system every time it runs. Arch even makes installing from source dead simple. I haven't done a make install on here yet.
*Lordlyhour dances
<Kabaka> Fedora is not bad.
<AllisZero> o.o
<Lordlyhour> on the moon
<Lordlyhour> With Luna. On the moon
<Kabaka> I still had one machine running it until I decommissioned my servers in Tulsa.
<Stomper> that doessnt borg up the system
<Derpieshy> wat, how does arch compile from source
<Lordlyhour> I dance. TO stave off
<Colgate> I haven't had to compile from source on arch yet
<Kabaka> Well, there's the AUR (Arch User Repository)
<Lordlyhour> My depression. BeefStronganoff
<EspyLacopa> His moustache is touching his brain!
<Kabaka> You can get a PKGBUILD from that and feed it to a system utility
<Lordlyhour> I some how doubt thats how yiou spell the name of te tastey dish though
<Kabaka> It handles downloading, patching, dependencies, and then compilation and install.
<Kabaka> The whole process can be automated by a pacman wrapper (I use packer).
<Kabaka> So installing things from source that are in the AUR is the same command as installing the actual packages from the main repos.
<AllisZero> The tick was awesome
<Lordlyhour> Alot of people are AFK
<Kabaka> Making your own PKGBUILD is really, really simple, too. So if it's not there, you just throw one together, make it a package, then hand it off to pacman.
<Lordlyhour> I must drive them away with my bouts of whiney angsting
<Derpieshy> obai Donraj
<Derpieshy> imean
<Lordlyhour> OR "wangsting" if you so prefer
<Stomper> hi Donraj
<Derpieshy> ohai
<Donraj> Hi
<Derpieshy> don't go
<Stomper> lol
<BitAFK> Doing quite a good job at it to. *disappears*
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: D: THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL
<Kabaka> Donraj: Hi!
<Donraj> Yo!
<mook> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:23h:00m:12s
<Donraj> This is the right room, yes? It said #bronychan on Equestria Daily, but I assumed they made the same typo twice
<Derpieshy> also Kabaka, I should give arch another go sometime after I do some more reading on xorg
<Iks> wang sting.... sounds like it hurts
<Derpieshy> this is the right room
<Kabaka> Donraj: Indeed!
<Donraj> Kay
<Stomper> yes this is right room
<Derpieshy> I lol'ed at the typo
<EspyLacopa> The source of the quote, "I CAN'T READ YOUR CRAZY MOON LANGUAGE!"
<mook> "no one messes with lo wang!"
<Stomper> nice to know prob 90% of people are going to wrong place
<Stomper> welcome mr 10%
<Iks> anyways... ron paul 2012 right?
<Colgate> I was trying to go to dronychan.net
<Colgate> er, bronychan.net
<Colgate> which of course, didn't resolve
<Kabaka> Yeah, that's what they have up
<Kabaka> First thing I did
<Derpieshy> I should uh
<Kabaka> $ host irc.bronychan.net
<Kabaka> Host irc.bronychan.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
<Derpieshy> email them and tell them to change it
<Colgate> eventually somepony posted a comment
<Kabaka> Probably.
<Kabaka> That was Derpieshy
<Derpieshy> hi
<Stomper> hi
<Kabaka> :D
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: Just register bronychan.net (it's not taken)
<Stomper> oh sheet
<Stomper> good idea
<Kabaka> I thought about nabbing it and having it go to my network
<Derpieshy> ah but that's another $10
<Leonon> Joker 2012, because some parties just want to watch the world burn
<Kabaka> I wonder what my cost is for .net domains. I think it went down recently.
*Kabaka looks
<Lordlyhour> Pinkie 2012
<EspyLacopa> It's Taft!
<Iks> *sigh*
<Derpieshy> I haven't really shopped around lately
<Derpieshy> been using dreamhost for a few years
<prince-dari> Ok, need to switch over all the IRCs again. :P >_>
<Kabaka> Sweet, my cost did go down a tiny bit
<Kabaka> I should go lower my prices
<Kabaka> All the IRCs? lol wut
<Derpieshy> that was my reaction
<prince-dari> What I mean is all the mibbit embeds.
<Derpieshy> oh lol
<prince-dari> I have to change all of them to come here.
<Derpieshy> Hey prince-dari
<Derpieshy> are you streaming from your cable line?
<Lordlyhour> http://www.explosm.net/comics/2322/
<MetalRainbowDash> http://mibbit.com/?channel=%23ponychat&server=irc.mibbit.net
<Lordlyhour> Pun comic is pun
<Derpieshy> or are you ripping stuff and then streaming it
<prince-dari> I'm not 100% how our Hub stream is, as I'm not the one who streams it.
<MetalRainbowDash> :( deadchat
<Derpieshy> oh
<prince-dari> I think it's an HD capture card.
<Derpieshy> are y'all planning on streaming season 2?
<prince-dari> Yeah, we're streaming all of S2 live.
<Derpieshy> if so, you've got 1+ viewer
<Derpieshy> I do not have the hub in my dorm
<Derpieshy> :c
<prince-dari> The mane6 stream had ~2600 people max at one point.
<Derpieshy> I saw that
<Kabaka> It peaked at like 3,300.
<prince-dari> So we're expecting more than that probably.
<Derpieshy> Kabaka: that's why we got so many servers
<Derpieshy> prince-dari: that was people watching though
<prince-dari> Gunna switch over IRC.
<prince-dari> Again.
<prince-dari> :P
<Derpieshy> not everyone goes to the chat
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: Ah. I think this is way overkill.
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: I think 50 users within 3 months would be optimistic, and you wouldn't need half the network for that.
<Derpieshy> welp, money already spent
<Derpieshy> so I'm not too worried
<Kabaka> Yeah
<prince-dari> It'll be >1000 people I'm sure of anyway.
<Kabaka> I was surprised/impressed when I saw 4 IPs show up when I did the DNS lookup
<eddyvalentine> Hello?
<prince-dari> >1000 in the IRC
<prince-dari> We have 300+ for BMN, and that's nothing compared to S2.
<Derpieshy> I'll pay for all the servers for another month after this one
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Derpieshy> and if it looks like I'm spending too much money
<Derpieshy> I'll drop one or two
<Kabaka> Yeah. Gotta see how the trend goes.
<prince-dari> You gunna get EQD to locate here?
<Derpieshy> I'm ganna try
<prince-dari> Maybe get a few smaller places first, as that'll be easier.
<Derpieshy> yeah
<prince-dari> Then when you've got a fairly large number of people/brony communities here.
<Derpieshy> gatta build up a reputation
<Derpieshy> I did post on /www/ on bronychat, wondering how much traffic we get from there
<Derpieshy> imean ponychan
<Derpieshy> fffffffffff- I pulled a Seth
<Kabaka> lolololol
<Luna> 07again?
<Luna> 07when..?
<Kabaka> I'm friends with the guys that do a really popular furry podcast. They're all bronies, and so are most of the listeners, and they all use IRC. I'll have them mention the network.
<Colgate> I'd go here from EqD
<Kabaka> Oh wait, they also do a MLP podcast.
<Kabaka> This is perfect.
<Colgate> might get better OPs too XD
<Derpieshy> yeah, we're really understaffed as is
<Iks> i dont get it
<Kabaka> >:D
<prince-dari> The Brony Show give us regular mentions, though because they use livestream I don't think they have an IRC.
<prince-dari> Which is meh.
<prince-dari> Livestream chat. >_>
<Kabaka> Ah
<Derpieshy> I like to use mibbit with streams personally
<Kabaka> The guys I know have between 5,000 and 10,000 listeners on one show. Dunno about the other.
<Lordlyhour> ...
<Kabaka> Their show is not streamed, though, so things like that don't matter.
<Lordlyhour> YOu should be stabbed
<Kabaka> It'll at least get more people curious.
<Derpieshy> dat shoutout
<Lordlyhour> Its a basic pun about a Linguistic technique
<prince-dari> Our .net domain's registered now.
<prince-dari> Yay.
<Lordlyhour> wherein a word sounds like the sound its describing
<MetalRainbowDash> Did u look at my application
<MetalRainbowDash> I senti t
<MetalRainbowDash> it
<Lordlyhour> Such as bang
<Derpieshy> bronystate.net?
<Lordlyhour> Or woof
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<Lordlyhour> Of Pyew
<Derpieshy> yay
<Kabaka> :o
<prince-dari> My CSS theme's pretty basic, I think some of our mods are gunna work on several so that you can have a choice of themes for the site.
<Mibbitshy> I SEE EVERYTHING IS IN WORKING ORDER
<prince-dari> We have some pretty awesome graphical designers and web designers. :)
<Rainbow_Dash> I still havent died once on Dead Island
<bicyclerepairman> you do realize that there are languages beside english where things have different names, right?
<Rainbow_Dash> Im so pro
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
*Luna is thinking about purchasing it or not...
<Derpieshy> I'm so ashamed of this networks site
<Rainbow_Dash> Its fun
<Derpieshy> I'm not finished with it yet but
<Derpieshy> still
<Iks> my english is quite good... but i dont get the pun
<Lordlyhour> he should still be stabbed
<Lordlyhour> Stabbed with knowledge
<Luna> 07yea.. but I pre-ordered sam BFE + it looks like another left4 cloon
<Luna> 07clone*
<Kabaka> I checked it out before connecting.
<Rainbow_Dash> Well, its not really a shooter
<Derpieshy> I'm sorry
<Kabaka> LOL
<Luna> 07enlighten me ;)
<Kabaka> Don't worry about it.
<Rainbow_Dash> There are guns, but they are very rare, and ammo is very very limited
<Colgate> This is an example update body.
<Lordlyhour> An onomatopoeia is something that is exactly what it sounds like
<Rainbow_Dash> I played all day yesterday and still havent found one
<AllisZero> Dang
<Derpieshy> I was working on the template before I put php in
<Luna> 07tell me more ;)
<Lordlyhour> its using the definition of the word Onomatopoeia, but making it sound like its a diease
<Kabaka> Going to write everything from scratch?
<Derpieshy> ye
<Kabaka> Awesome
<Rainbow_Dash> Hmm.. Your health doesnt regenerate
<Iks> i see
<Rainbow_Dash> There are energy drinks sitting around that you drink to heal yourself, but you cant take them with you
<Derpieshy> I'm a little rusty with my html though :/
<Rainbow_Dash> You can craft Medkits, if you have the supplies
<Kabaka> I will be HEAVILY CRITICAL of your web design/programming.
*Kabaka STARE
<prince-dari> Ahh, I just stuck with HTML + CSS, since it's easiest, and I've never made a site before.
<Derpieshy> I'm used to editing Kusaba X or redoing something I've already done
<Rainbow_Dash> The combat is very.. Brutal
<Lordlyhour> YOU HAVE BEEN STABBED WITH KNOWLEDGE
<prince-dari> From scratch FTW.
<Lordlyhour> I accept payment in all major Currencies of the South East Pacific
<Luna> 07It looks stunning
<AllisZero> Brutal as in, gory or difficult?
<Rainbow_Dash> Both
<Rainbow_Dash> XD
<Rainbow_Dash> I still havent died once though
<bicyclerepairman> so… fish?
<Rainbow_Dash> But the zombies can overwhelm you..
<AllisZero> I see
<Rainbow_Dash> The only bad thing about the game is the cutscenes and voice acting
<Rainbow_Dash> The combat is very fun though. XD
<Iks> i pay you in karma
<Luna> 07yea the voiceacting was X.X to me
<Lordlyhour> YES!
<Lordlyhour> oh
<Lordlyhour> Karma is good
<MetalRainbowDash> What is Skrillex?
<Rainbow_Dash> This is my favorite trailer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq4CNlN6NZw
<Luna> 07did you look at Sam BFE? (Best friends ever)
<Luna> 07taking a peek
<Rainbow_Dash> Havent heard about it
<AllisZero> Does it have Coop, RD?
<Rainbow_Dash> I dont think I can get any more games for now anyway. I have Skyrim and BF3 preordered for PC
<Derpieshy> I made the front page of http://www.animuchan.org/ from scratch
<Rainbow_Dash> Yes
<Rainbow_Dash> 4 players
<AllisZero> Nice
<Leonon> now you'll have something to bribe them with the next time you encounter the karma police
<Luna> 07so does sam :P
<Derpieshy> not trying to advertise, promise
<Donraj> I'm working on a post introducing a forum I hang out at to the ponies
<prince-dari> Ooh, looks nice.
<Luna> 07I like the vid thanks for linking it
<Lordlyhour> Or a Karma Chameleon
<Luna> 07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdv1V8ABSco
<Rainbow_Dash> Np
<Donraj> "For a long time now, there's been a hole in my life. I tried to fill that hole with a lot of things: games, alcohol, lots and lots of women, but nothing could satisfy the nameless emptiness inside of me. But now, there is a show that fills that void. A show so awesome, that it is as if Batman were to kill Superman and eat his heart to gain Superman's great powers and then fly up into the air to have man-sex with Chuck Norris for several
<Donraj> hours."
<Donraj> This is what I have so far
<AllisZero> Err
<Leonon> you don't really have to bribe them, they just sort of come and go
<Donraj> Also looks nice
<Rainbow_Dash> The graphics are like an old arcade game with high res textures and stuff
<Rainbow_Dash> It looks fun
<AllisZero> I wouldn't have expected a game called Serious Sam to be this haha
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<Luna> 07:D
<Derpieshy> y thank u
<Luna> 07it's awesome :D
<Derpieshy> I can't seem to do it again though :c
<AllisZero> Yeah it looks very much like a 90's game with upgraded graphics
<Rainbow_Dash> It kinda works good for a game like that
<prince-dari> IRCs are all switched over.
<Luna> 07yep
<prince-dari> Refresh the page.
<prince-dari> Or close and reopen your browser.
<prince-dari> Or whatever.
<AllisZero> Again :(
<prince-dari> Yes.
<prince-dari> Again.
<Luna> 07change irc url?
<AllisZero> Refreshing!
<prince-dari> irc.bronychat.net
<Derpieshy> is Pontang still here?
<Luna> 07cheers
<Luna> 07brb
<WhatPayne> ty
<WhatPayne> Ohey I
<WhatPayne> I'm already here
<Lilfut> so, has anypony else played tetris attack?
<Nittany_Tiger> dari, I love how you're super indecisive.
<AllisZero> Yay
<prince-dari> Not indecisive.
<Luna> 07yay
<prince-dari> I just happen to be very unlucky.
<Luna> 07i'm on the interwebz!
<Donraj> It would seem not
<Derpieshy> :/
<MetalRainbowDash> Prince-dari
<MetalRainbowDash> Luna
<prince-dari> I switch us over from the first server due to constant net splits during BMN.
<Derpieshy> ohai Luna
<AllisZero> This is a dilemma
<MetalRainbowDash> Prince I sent my application.
<prince-dari> Then everything's fine for a while.
<Luna> 07hehe? you want it? :)
<Lilfut> that game was my childhood
<Luna> 07you can play with me! :D
<prince-dari> Then suddenly our users are capped at 200.
<prince-dari> So I switch us over to here.
<AllisZero> Eh?
<Luna> 07ohhh not about Sam
<prince-dari> Judging by the spam we get on BMN, S2 premiere would likely crash the network.
*Luna sobs in a corner
<prince-dari> Can't have that.
*AllisZero pets Luna
<prince-dari> So I switch it over again, somewhere more reliable.
<MetalRainbowDash> Prince did you look at my application?
<Rainbow_Dash> Wat?
<Luna> 07~yay
<prince-dari> Unfortunately it happens that the network wasn't set up for mibbit to work at the time, due to an oversight.
<Luna> 07brb brushing cat
<prince-dari> So I had to switch back because we were doing showing the viewers or Hub stream.
<mook> >Karma Chameleon
<AllisZero> Alright
<Iks> wtf is tetris attack
<Derpieshy> and now people are just flushing in
<Iks> i played tetris
<prince-dari> Now I'm switching it back over because it's S2 soon and mibbit will now work on the network.
<AllisZero> I'll look into the game!
<prince-dari> As I said, I'm not being indecisive.
<Rainbow_Dash> Im waiting on that S2 picture for today
<prince-dari> It's just that shit happens.
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<prince-dari> MetalRainbowDash: And no, I'm rather busy at the moment, sorry.
<Lilfut> tetris attack was also called...
<Lilfut> panel de pon
<Lilfut> pokemon puzzle league
<Lilfut> a number of other games with "puzzle league" in the title
<Donraj> Also why am I up so early?
<Donraj> :(
<Derpieshy> idk, ponies?
<Lordlyhour> The puns
<Lordlyhour> you are slaying me with the,
<Lilfut> puns?
<Lilfut> huh?
*EspyLacopa pops into actual new server
<EspyLacopa> weeee
<Colgate> are you guys from #brony on geekshed?
<MetalRainbowDash> ok
<Donraj> I hang out in #EquestriaDaily sometimes
<mook> "You sense a certain tension"
<Donraj> I think I went to #brony once or twice
<Donraj> Remind me, it's nine more days until season 2, right?
<Derpieshy> isn't it 8?
<prince-dari> 8 for me.
<Donraj> Ah
<Donraj> Kay
<Colgate> was just wondering because there was a mass ban on them for advertising other irc networks, was wondering if it was this one
<AmyAmelia> hello
<Pontang> o.o
<Bash> sooo
<prince-dari> QR code on EQD.
<Derpieshy> idrc, as long as your not like
<prince-dari> Anyone got a phone that reads QR codes?
<WhatPayne> Hey, is Bronystate still in need of people?
<Bash> what's wrong with the regular IRC networks
<Derpieshy> COME JOIN NOTHER NETWORK THIS ONE SUCKS
<Pontang> We haven't really advertised on any other IRC networks.
<Donraj> What's a QR code?
<prince-dari> Look at EQD's last post.
<prince-dari> You'll see.
<prince-dari> :P
<Luna> 07yep
<Colgate> this is all secondhand knowledge froma geekshed admin, that's all I know, /shrug
<Donraj> Ah
<Pontang> Random advertisementis not in our policy.
<WhatPayne> hmm...
<Pontang> We'd rather get users who want to be here to be here.
<Pontang> We're going to build up based on satisfaction.
<Derpieshy> ^ this
<prince-dari> The regular IRC networks meaning?
<Kabaka> Good plan.
<Pontang> All advertising does is bring people who want to take you down.
<Pontang> Botnets galore.
<Pontang> xD
<Colgate> hey, just as long as you don't me for having a discussion on anon comments on EqD posts, I'm cool with it -.-
<Kabaka> Word of mouth is the only way to go.
<Colgate> ban me*
<Lordlyhour> WEll.
<Bash> the one's that have been around forever, that aren't dedicated for brony-purposes
<Lordlyhour> That was anticlimatic
<Bash> like quakenet (yeah i guess that one splits a fair bit) etc
<prince-dari> If you mean already established large networks.
<Pontang> We're more or less looking to bring the brony community together rather than 'force them'. xD
<WhatPayne> I'm contemplating whether I should apply to the job...
<Bash> though i guess since this is kinda meant to just have people come through the theater thing it doesn't really matter
<Lordlyhour> Anyhoodles, I must away so I can get some lovely sleep happy yummy fun fun times
<Bash> if i'm not mistaken
<Lordlyhour> I hope I get to be in the Stats
<prince-dari> Connection is likely to be slower due to a large number of users connecting all the time, netsplits are quite common on big networks too.
<Lordlyhour> and that is my quote
<prince-dari> The people who run the networks are likely not to give a shit about us.
<Lordlyhour> Because that would be awesome
<prince-dari> So they won't do much to help us out, or change server configs for us.
<Lordlyhour> Maths time!
<Kabaka> Speaking of botnets, do you guys have a BOPM or something similar set up, since Unreal doesn't have that built in? Trolls like to target pony things, so... (This is something else I could supply.)
<bicyclerepairman> maths. not even once.
<prince-dari> These large networks are likely to be filled with people who would come in and troll.
<Bash> i see
<Bash> makes sense
<Pontang> I need to install them on all the servers. Never really got the chance. Waiting for my friend to help me with adding dnsbl, he runs a few that he updates himself.
<prince-dari> They are also more likely to have people who would DDoS us or whatever else.
<Kabaka> You're going to run per-server BOPMs? Why?
<Pontang> Plus we're probably changing hubs.
<Pontang> Less stress I assume.
<Leonon> I don't get why they say that, I doo math all the time and I'm just fine
<Derpieshy> Pontang wants to change the hub to a vps rather than an ircd
<Lordlyhour> whats the link to the stats page?
<Kabaka> Derpieshy: That sentence makes no sense. You mean VPS rather than shell?
<Derpieshy> ...yeah right sorry
<bicyclerepairman> have you tried quitting math again? it's a drug i say!
<Luna> 07oh my... such little cats.. so much furr
<Kabaka> Pontang: Barely. You'll just have to run extra software and have many possibly port scan origins.
*Luna is covered in furr
<Luna> 07brb
<Kabaka> Pontang: For a network this size, that seems highly impractical.
<Kabaka> Er, rearrange the words on the end of the first message.
<Leonon> I can quit any time I want!
<Pontang> The VPS is cheaper tbh.
<Pontang> ;x
*Leonon injects some Pi "Oh yeah, that's the stuff"
<bicyclerepairman> that's what they all say...
<Derpieshy> son, I'm spending $40 a month
<CogWeaver> morning all
<Pontang> Plus we'd like to switch to services that we know we can get support on.
<Kabaka> You should always avoid buying IRCD shells.
<Kabaka> They're always crap.
<bicyclerepairman> hey CogWeaver
<Derpieshy> wat
<Kabaka> I suspect that's why I got disconnected earlier.
<Lordlyhour> Morning Cog
<Derpieshy> what would you advice?
<Lordlyhour> How are you doing?
<Lordlyhour> Are you doing awesome? I hope you're doing awesome
<Kabaka> VPS or dedicated
<Pontang> They seem cheaper too.
<Derpieshy> man dedicated servers cost so much
<Lordlyhour> To all, a Goodnight
<Pontang> VPS can run at like $10. Pretty nice tbh
<Kabaka> Yeah. VPS is the way to go for a network this size.
<Pontang> I know thrustvps offers $7.95 for VPSes
<Kabaka> Be careful of who you buy from. Some VPS providers are worse than shell providers.
<Pontang> Tr
<Pontang> True*
<Pontang> But someone recommended them, said he gets an uptime of 200+ days.
<mook> !link
<DerpyBot> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10906236/Pony/Special/pony_creator.swf
<Kabaka> That's a start.
<Kabaka> But with IRC, you want consistent connectivity. Dropped packets are no bueno.
<AllisZero> Eh, I know the feeling Luna, my dog is big but he produces his own weight in fur on a weekly basis
<Kabaka> There's pretty much never a guarantee for that on any providers.
<Pontang> Granted, I'm not sure about running a whole VPS, don't you have to set up firewalls and stuff?
<Kabaka> Yeah.
<Luna> 07AllisZero search on the web for a furminator
<Luna> 07that's what I use for my cats
<Pontang> Well, if you want to be a tech...
<Pontang> xD
<Kabaka> Generally, a VPS will come with a very stock system
<Luna> 07it's amazing
<AllisZero> I have it, I use it on him on a weekly basis
<Kabaka> That's what I do for my company
<Luna> 07ahhh happy with it?
<Kabaka> I sit around and play with servers all day.
<AllisZero> Still, a LOT of fur
<Luna> 07yes...
<AllisZero> Yep, it works great
<Luna> 07my cats love the thing
<Kabaka> I spent a good part of last week writing software for centralized firewall control, in fact, since you mention that.
<Pontang> Might have a new job of doing our's as well. :p
<Kabaka> :D
<Kabaka> I would enjoy that.
<AllisZero> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/328/e/4/sora__s_first_picture_ever__by_alliszero-d33jv91.jpg
<AllisZero> My pup!
<Luna> 07oh my!
<Luna> 07a husky!
<AllisZero> Yush
<Natleyn> D'awwww
<Pontang> xD
<Luna> 07picture of face?
<LordlyhourAsleep> Having a computer that can look like its off with the press of two keys and a button while still being running? great for downloadingstuff over night
<LordlyhourAsleep> ^.^
<AllisZero> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/328/5/0/sora_at_the_beach__feb_09_by_alliszero-d33jv0c.jpg
<Luna> 07pretty!
<Luna> 07I like the name
<Luna> 07Sora
<AllisZero> It's the eyes
<Luna> 07yes
<Luna> 07want a kitty pic?
<Pontang> Need someone who is good with structure. Very important if we want to offer the best satisfaction.
<Kabaka> Structure in what sense?
<Pontang> Well, someone who can keep the servers in order.
<Derpieshy> I do
<MrPoniator> I like stuff like that
<Luna> 07one sec ;)
<MrPoniator> Or when you can boot a computer from sleep mode in a few seconds
<mook> i have a dir320 with 500gb usb hdd plugged in
<AllisZero> Yes yes
<Kabaka> If you're referring to IRC servers, I've kept another network in one piece for almost 4 years (and one server thereof operational for 2+ before that). We've currently got less servers than this network, but we've had up to 7 at a few points in time.
<Luna> 07http://i.imgur.com/t7nYD.jpg
<mook> for torrents and vpn
<Kabaka> Two hidden hubs, arranged geographically, and three round robins for different parts of the world (and one main one for the uncaring folks).
<Pontang> I see.
<Pontang> That's good.
<Pontang> We're looking for something like that.
<Pontang> :p
<Luna> 07http://i.imgur.com/csAPO.jpg
<Kabaka> I noticed you've got a hidden hub right now
<Pontang> eyup
<Kabaka> Though everything is kind of hidden since none of the hostnames are real.
<MetalRainbowDash> deadchat
<Awesomeshy> eh
<Awesomeshy> fluttershy is
<Kabaka> Ah
<Kabaka> I only tested a few.
<Kabaka> You should flatten your map, by the way
<Pontang> But, we are thinking of running Surrealservices. Mainly because we can get support from the dev team.
<Awesomeshy> Actually I mentioned Surreal Services to Kabaka
<Pontang> Ah
<AllisZero> How cute
<AllisZero> Drinking from the glass haha
<Kabaka> Have you thought about Atheme? I'm good friends with the main developer, and an oper on their home network. Same with Charybdis.
<Kabaka> My network switched from Unreal/Anope to Charybdis/Atheme a few months ago. It was the best decision we made.
<Pontang> Hm
<Luna> 07Well the glass is a "normal"thing
<Kabaka> I only gave in after opering with Charybdis/Atheme for a few years. It was just too much... nicer.
<Luna> 07but I caught him here too..
<Luna> 07http://i.imgur.com/NmW5Q.jpg
<Kabaka> More streamlined. Less confusing bloat.
<AllisZero> LOL
<Luna> 07crazy cat is crazy
<Pontang> What networks use it?
<AllisZero> Yep
<Luna> 07but I love him
<Pontang> I'll give it a look.
<Kabaka> Freenode uses a modified version of Charybdis and Atheme.
<Luna> 07oh yes and i'm a WoW fan
<Luna> 07http://i.imgur.com/Avkr5.jpg
<Kabaka> StaticBox, their home network that I referred to earlier, does as well.
<Kabaka> Quite a few others do. I can't remember off the top of my head.
<AllisZero> Do you play?
<Luna> 07I played but quit recently
<Luna> 07I played ever since the closed vanilla beta
<AllisZero> I see
<Kabaka> It's a different way of doing things, of course. You can't expect to switch and maintain the same exact habits.
<AllisZero> I've been playing since 08, so I still have a bit of gas left to keep going
<Pontang> I think why we like surrealservices so much is because they are really user friendly.
<Kabaka> The difference for end-users is negligible.
<AllisZero> Cata didn't make me very happy sadly
<Kabaka> In what way?
<Kabaka> You mean the developers?
<Pontang> Awesomeshy knows, he runs a channel on there.
<Awesomeshy> tbh
<Luna> 07and this is our other cat
<Luna> 07http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/539/presentpoojawj9.jpg
<Awesomeshy> the only thing I really like over anope with surreal services is gidentify
<Awesomeshy> on nickserv
<AllisZero> Cute
<Pontang> Lol
<AllisZero> I love cats and dogs
<Kabaka> What does that do?
<Nittany_Tiger> I have a cat myself.
<AllisZero> Have more experience with dogs however
<Awesomeshy> kills the connection of someone using your nick, registers and changes your nick
<Luna> 07I have more experience with cats.. but I had a goldenretriever before I had to travel 300 km/h per day
<Kabaka> So ghost + identify
<Awesomeshy> ye
<Kabaka> I guess that's kind of interesting
<Luna> 07Last cat pic :) http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/6118/009zo2.jpg
<Pontang> Have you ever tried them?
<Kabaka> I haven't. All I've heard is that they're sillier than Anope, though not quite as horribly coded.
<AllisZero> That's a pretty coat
<Luna> 07Pooja = Russian Blue & Onesh is a Nebelung
<Pontang> You should. But as I've said, they're really quite user friendly.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yep.
<AllisZero> I see
<AllisZero> I wanna get another dog to keep Sora company
<Rainbow_Dash> I finally died on Dead Island
<Luna> 07finally!
<Luna> 07lol
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<Pontang> I love the vacation command so it increases your exire time if you are leaving for awhile.
<AllisZero> Now that I'm working full time he's lonely
<Rainbow_Dash> This big "Thug" zombie knocked me off my feet
<Rainbow_Dash> I was trapped in a building
<Rainbow_Dash> I tried to run past him XD
<Kabaka> > Based on: Anope, Auspice, NeoStats
<Luna> 07I can understand that
<Kabaka> I already don't like it
<Rainbow_Dash> Because thugs are very very slow
<Pontang> lawl
<Rainbow_Dash> But really strong
<Kabaka> Atheme has vacation as well
<La_Formidable_Trixie> !s4
<Kabaka> I think there's an Anope module for it too
<Rainbow_Dash> Unfortunately, he hit me
<Pontang> Oh?
<Kabaka> Yeah
<Kabaka> VACATION extends the expiration time for your
<Kabaka> account and nicknames (but not your channels)
<Kabaka> to three times the usual value. You can only
<Kabaka> do this if your account is registered long
<Kabaka> enough.
<AllisZero> Taaaaaaank
<MrPoniator> 9_6
<Thorinair> lol
<Leonon> I think you may be asking too much of Derpy
<Pontang> Hmm, does charybdis allow for ~/&/@/%/+?
<MrPoniator> inb4 s4 is announced, and it's full of Trixie
<Iks> hmm i wonder... lets say there will be quite many more seasons... would you want for the characters to age or to stay the same
<Coz> !s3
<DerpyBot> I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
<mook> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<mook> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps mook
<Kabaka> No. I don't think there's a module for it either. Why are so many separate modes necessary?
<Leonon> it would be kind of funny if we made 1,210,000,000 muffins to figure out when S3 starts
<MrPoniator> That does make me wonder how many seasons will MLP:FiM still get
<Rainbow_Dash> Something like that
<Pontang> I like the structure of it I suppose. But tbh, I'm really used to it.
<Rainbow_Dash> Every time they hit you it sends you flying back
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<Iks> and again i am ignored
<Leonon> all the seasons
<Kabaka> I used to be, too. Like I said, almost 8 years of Unreal
<Luna> 07sounds like a tank, yes
<Kabaka> When we switched to Atheme/Charybdis, we started making use of services for most channel operator stuff.
<Rainbow_Dash> Honestly I just have to run if I dont have my fury or some sort of explosive ready
<Iks> well i would like them to age and evolve... i hate every tv show where there is never progress
<Kabaka> You get finer control of who can do what using flags
<Iks> like the simpsons
<MrPoniator> And Iks, in shows like these the tendency is that they never really age
<Luna> 07hehe yes, that might be the best choice
<Leonon> in Venture Brothers they age
<Iks> never seen that show
<Pontang> Ah
<Kabaka> And there's still +o and +v for channels. But then you get things like +q for quiet (works like +b so you can quiet by hostmask)
<Leonon> and...I think that's the only one
<MrPoniator> Yeah, there are exceptions
<Pontang> Well, it's all up to Awesomeshy really. It's his network.
<MrPoniator> But slice of life style of shows can go on as long as they want to keep churning them out
<prince-dari> Because you're on the wrong network.
<Kabaka> Yeah.
<Awesomeshy> I do have a few questions
<Awesomeshy> also I love how you always say that
<Kabaka> I'll want to help out whichever direction you decide to go. I'm just giving my advice based on my experiences throughout the years, and how much I trust the Atheme devs
<Pontang> :I
<Iks> well i would like the CMC to get older... or do you want them to be blankflanks forever
<Boegela> imma back
<Boegela> WAZAAAA?
<Pontang> Well Awesomeshy, I'm not going to be on forever. You're going to have to make the decisions. xD
<Retsamoreh> Blankflanks forever!
<Iks> noooo
<Nashy> Story of the blanks D:
<MrPoniator> It will probably be tha last season or something when they do get their cutie marks
<AllisZero> Haro
<Awesomeshy> can we switch out from unreal to charydbis without enraging a bunch of people
<prince-dari> MFW people cry because of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wujiEeZje_M&feature=player_embedded
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "PMV - When She Loved Me [ Celestia + Luna ]" - "OKAY I&#39;M DONE WITH THIS. Any more editing and it will probably end up as just a still shot of baby Woona for the whole thing. As it is I think it&#39;s probably ..."
<Flutteryay> All right then.
<Rainbow_Dash> > Mfw im stranded on top of a stack of barrels with a thug trying to get me
<Iks> well they could make it a cliffhanger for season 3
<Flutteryay> MOVIN' OUT :)
<Kabaka> I'm guessing you're referring to the bunch in #bronystate, since the rest of the network appears empty
<Pontang> True, if we want other channels to join, most of them are probably used to using Unreal.
<Iks> like last episode they will get em but we wont be seeing them until season 3
<Awesomeshy> lol yeah
<Awesomeshy> nono
<Kabaka> Well
<Awesomeshy> Pontang: that's not what I meant
<Awesomeshy> I ment
<Awesomeshy> going down
<Pontang> Ah
<Nashy> well we all know what their talents are anyway
*Luna cries
<Kabaka> If you do things right, the actual downtime could be kept to less than ten seconds.
<Awesomeshy> cool
<Luna> 07it..it...works
<MrPoniator> Yep
<AllisZero> I'm not gonna get watery-eyed at work am I
<Kabaka> Lots of DNS juggling and careful testing is required for that sort of trick, but it can be done.
<Luna> 07yes...
<Turgle> baaaack
<AllisZero> Alright, watch later it is
<Pontang> Well, if this can provide the best possible service for the users. I'm down with it.
<Luna> 07i'll add it to our playlist :P
<Awesomeshy> as long as we get rid of anope
<Flutteryay> All right, I'm here
<Awesomeshy> :v
<Pontang> ;o
<Luna> 07~yay
<Flutteryay> (yay~)
<Flutteryay> ninja'd
<Kabaka> > as long as we get rid of anope
<Luna> 07^
<Pontang> Anyway, we're going to slowly move to VPS anyway.
<Kabaka> I like that attitude.
<Flutteryay> hehehe
<EspyLacopa> Does it have alfalfa monster?
<Kabaka> That's definitely a good idea.
<prince-dari> When are you planning to do this?
<prince-dari> Because today, and tomorrow are bad.
<Awesomeshy> not today or tomorrow
<Pontang> Probably not that time frame.
<Pontang> :p
<prince-dari> And any time anywhere near the S2 premiere are very bad.
<Luna> 07omg!
<Pontang> We'll do it as slowly as possible.
<Luna> 07it happened!
<prince-dari> Or any Friday/Saturday.
<Awesomeshy> it'll probably be a little sooner than next month
<Pontang> xD
<EspyLacopa> what?
<Luna> 07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubmM0L2oZAg&feature=BFa&list=FLIdm9GNQhrYVg4bI_vGZ8hw&lf=BFp
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "[MLP:FiM] Ponies Make You Feel Good" - "I thought there was a lack of PMVs on YouTube, so I made one."
<Awesomeshy> for the uh
<Awesomeshy> vps's
<Pontang> Well, I'll buy the VPS soon, so we can set that up with the future of the network in mind.
<EspyLacopa> Watching that will have to wait, still listening to Dari's link.
<Luna> 07hehe sure
<Awesomeshy> and keep your pockets a little less shallow I presume
<Awesomeshy> 3;
<Pontang> VPSes seem cheaper than actual shells.
<Pontang> >.>;
<prince-dari> Why does that make people cry...?
<prince-dari> O_o
<Pontang> Hell, you can buy a VPS from france for like $7
<Luna> 07it made me cry
<EspyLacopa> Manly Tears.
<Luna> 07so it just does...!
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Kabaka> Linode and RapidXen are my recommendations for this kind of thing.
<La_Formidable_Trixie> Scootaloo's cutie mark will be a chicken
<MrPoniator> oh noes
<Awesomeshy> :c Linode looked kind of expensive
<prince-dari> Things like that don't work for me.
<Kabaka> "You get what you pay for" applies to hosting
<Kabaka> That said, my offer for a free node is still up.
<Maeni> Aaah, isnt it amazing how I percieve music differntly when i' drunk+ XD
<prince-dari> Tennant's last episode didn't even make me cry, so I doubt there's anything on the internet that can.
<Maeni> O god what ht efuck is wrong with my speellling
<Maeni> AHahahahhaa
<Maeni> + I posted in the wrong chat <3
<Maeni> hi EqD
<Pontang> Rapidxen has something for $7.95
<Retsamoreh> Maeni
<Kabaka> I know the guy that owns it
<Kabaka> Er, well, I guess not anymore. He quit
<Kabaka> But!
<Maeni> Hi rets ;3
<Retsamoreh> Wait
<Retsamoreh> Let me get a song
<Maeni> I'm more drunk than I thought
<Turgle> yay
<Kabaka> They're incredibly reliable. They've got tons of bandwidth available, so connectivity is never interrupted.
<EspyLacopa> prince-dari: You ever watched Grave of the Fireflies?
<Maeni> I' listening to pogo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVxe5NIABsI Got I fucking love everything he makes
<Pontang> I see
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Kabaka> They host some big companies that require real-time responsiveness. It's almost surprising they have anything that cheap.
<Awesomeshy> the $15 ones
<EspyLacopa> You totally should.
<Pontang> They're located in Los Angeles?
<GrimGallop> Ahoy
<Retsamoreh> Here you go Maeni
<Pontang> Hmm
<Maeni> ? :D
<Retsamoreh> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E41qz1FciU
<prince-dari> What, you think it could make me cry?
<prince-dari> GrimGallop: Hey.
<Maeni> Listening
<Retsamoreh> It's not music but it should trip your mind into infinity while drunk.
<Pontang> That's not close to Europe.
<Pontang> xD
<Turgle> [can i disconnect bronyserv.co.cc now?]
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Kabaka> RapidXen?
<Pontang> Yes
<Maeni> Hahhahaha oh, bugs? xD
<Kabaka> They're in LA, Chicago, and Germany
<Maeni> Oh god that face
<Retsamoreh> Keep watching
<Pontang> That's cool
<Kabaka> http://rapidxen.com/plans
<EspyLacopa> Bye bye old server
<Kabaka> Germany is pretty close to Europe :-P
<Pontang> Lmao
<Maeni> What the absolute ffuuuuuuuck
<Pontang> Didn't see that one.
<Pontang> xD
<Pontang> But I like the Chicago one. What better way to have the hub but in the heartland?
<Pontang> ;o
<Kabaka> Yeah
<Kabaka> Chicago is the best location they have, honestly.
<Awesomeshy> yay Chicago's in my time zone
<Kabaka> Well
<Retsamoreh> Told 'ya
<Pontang> So, I assume that atheme doesn't eat much RAM?
<Maeni> Yup XDD still watching
<Maeni> Good god, their faces
<Kabaka> I dunno, QuadraNet has been sucking a lot less in the last few years, so LA is also not bad.
<Nashy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeNUO2mg_vE if you want to trip on sounds :P
<Retsamoreh> You can keep watching that guy's vids for complete mindfuckery.
<Pontang> I might buy from all three locations.
<Kabaka> Let me see how the Athemes and Anopes are doing on one of my machines...
<Maeni> Mass efect seems like it's full of all kinds of up-fuckery...
<Maeni> Why dont I know more about this game? o.O
<Maeni> Direct intervention is necessary! *dances*
<Maeni> THIS IS TRUE POWER
<Kabaka> Okay, that's a terrible comparison. Hang on while I find a nice big set of graphs the Atheme guys made
<Awesomeshy> lol
<mook> >.>
<Kabaka> http://j.mp/pX1Zlt
<Nashy> Mass Effect is awesome.
<Maeni> :0
<Pontang> Of course, I think our biggest issue would be that to get channels from other networks to join, they probably use the unreal/anope setup. I fear they wouldn't want change.
<Kabaka> Lots of graphs, and then some chatter about what they mean
<Kabaka> That's a very valid concern. Maybe it would be pertinent to speak to the channel owners before doing anything.
<Maeni> Why still no Fallout Equestria chapter 39? xP
<Retsamoreh> It really is
<Awesomeshy> it's not like
<Awesomeshy> we're doing this any time soon
<Maeni> Damnit, does this mean it's another game I should play?
<Pontang> Yeah
<Kabaka> Of course
<Pontang> Still planning to switch to VPSes soon.
<Retsamoreh> ME1 is even buggier
<Maeni> 12 particles of matter, four forces of nature! that's a wonderful and significant story!
<Eights> Hello all
<Retsamoreh> So you can play BOTH
<Maeni> Hai o/
<Awesomeshy> how about
<Awesomeshy> we do the switch when we swap out the servers
<Eights> \o
<Pontang> But, I think before we change, we should wait and do this if we become 'The Brony IRC network'.
<Kabaka> It seems more sensible to not have a large network change software once it becomes big.
<Awesomeshy> oh yeah we're getting rid of anope
<Awesomeshy> after seeing this graph
<Pontang> True
<Awesomeshy> that's gatta go
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: LOL
<Awesomeshy> imean
<Kabaka> That's actually old, too. Atheme has been further optimized since then.
<Nashy> Neither of the ME games were very buggy...
<Pontang> I'm just curious what it would do when it comes to growing the network.
<Awesomeshy> holy shit that's really bad on anopes end
<MeteorVenture> well goodnight! i'm going to sleep
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Yeah. I don't think they optimize their code at all.
<Rainbow_Dash> Goodnight MeteorVenture
<Wrek> 05time to youtube untill dinner
<Wrek> 05good night MeteorVenture
<Kabaka> The main Atheme dev has a masters in computational mathematics. He'll break out the profiler and nail everything down as small as it will go without making the code unmaintainable.
<RyanRodriguez> I came here to ask the site to proceed to stream the Season 2 Premiere when it comes. How do I do that?
<AllisZero> Night MeteorVenture
<Kabaka> Though I think all that stuff was written a long time ago, aside from the burst stuff.
<Turgle> i don't think you have to ask :D
<AllisZero> It's right here sir
<RyanRodriguez> Oh. I thought they were only going to do it if enough people visited and asked them.
<RyanRodriguez> Hence, my being here.
<Luna> 07Well.. we will stream Season 2 as soon as it airs ;)
<AllisZero> Nope, we had over 200 people last night for the test
<RyanRodriguez> Ah.
<Turgle> <3
<Awesomeshy> still
<RyanRodriguez> In that case, I'm sorry to have insulted you with my presence.
<RyanRodriguez> But thank you for this.
<Turgle> ahahahhahah
<RyanRodriguez> I don't have access to Hub.
<Luna> 07no worries
<prince-dari> Insulted us with yourp presence?
<Turgle> don't worry RyanRodriguez
<RyanRodriguez> Yes.
<Turgle> you are welcome
<Luna> 07We love to have you around ;)
<prince-dari> We like people to come here and have fun. :)
<Awesomeshy> how would anthem work out with unreal until we switch servers?
<Pontang> Well, if we go with atheme, could it be made more 'anope user' friendly?
<RyanRodriguez> I appreciate that...
<Luna> 07don't forget tonight is our Movie Night :)
<RyanRodriguez> But I'm not really well-liked in the Brony community.
<Kabaka> Pontang: Definitely. Almost all the commands are the same, and what isn't can be aliased.
<Luna> 07how so?
<Natleyn> Whyever not?
<Pontang> Yeah
<RyanRodriguez> I wrote a fanfiction that I intended to be funny.
<Pontang> Well, it should work out if that's the case.
<Kabaka> Pontang: Even the weird VOP/HOP/AOP/SOP thing can be duplicated, though eventually everyone will move to flags anyway
<Kabaka> I actually don't think I've seen any commands that were at all confusing.
<prince-dari> Meh, I don't read fanfics anyway.
<Kabaka> Though my Indonesians practically died.
<prince-dari> So I wouldn't know.
<Pontang> Some people hate change. xD
<RobotPinkie> I'd say "induring cupcakes" but that'd be rude
<Kabaka> Yeah. That's for sure.
<RyanRodriguez> Apparently, readers interpreted it as a depraved, immature vomit puddle.
<Kabaka> I wouldn't have suggested anything if this network were larger.
<Pontang> Better to keep progression as small as possible. Work your way into it.
<Kabaka> Indeed.
<RyanRodriguez> Why would "Enduring Cupcakes" be a rude statement?
<prince-dari> Induring :P
<RobotPinkie> and ohay ponies
<Luna> 07Lo RobotPinkie
<Luna> 07how you feel today?
<Pontang> But the goal is to create a themed pony network as Rizon is to anime or freenode is to open sourced software.
<Kabaka> Though my network made the leap in one swift move.
<Kabaka> Rizon :-(
<Kabaka> You'll have to DDOS your competition if you want to be like them
<Kabaka> But I know what you mean.
<Natleyn> Ohhai RobotPinkie.
<Pontang> I know what you mean.
<Pontang> :p
<Luna> 07Well we love everypony :)
<Retsamoreh> And yes they were, Nashy.
<Kabaka> There's a need for a pony network right now.
<Luna> 07So your welcome to stay around, as much as you like
<Pontang> True
<mib_i3nmou> ohay, so the new servers are working nao?
<Kabaka> I wanted to make it mine, but the theme of the network always causes controversy.
<Luna> 07We switched again, yes
<Pontang> xD
<RyanRodriguez> When you mentioned tonight's a "Movie Night", what do you mean?
<RobotPinkie> lol kinda crashed while heading out, though i'm fine now
<Pontang> Well, we might have competition. But it's best if we take the apple route and just offer something easy and have staff that will help you regardless.
<Pontang> :o
<RobotPinkie> Tonight isn't just a movie night, it's like... THE movie night, almost.
<Awesomeshy> there's already another server
<Luna> 07RyanRodriguez take a peek here: http://www.bronystate.co.cc/
<Kabaka> There are several pony IRC networks out there right now.
<Luna> 07You can see tonight's line-up
<prince-dari> Or www.bronystate.net :P
<Pontang> I think that's the one that went advertising as Colgate said.
<Awesomeshy> really?
<Kabaka> Three, I believe, including this one.
<Luna> 07or bronystate.net yes!
<Awesomeshy> huh
<Kabaka> It's to be expected.
<Kabaka> Try not to take it personal, of course
<RyanRodriguez> Ah.
<Pontang> We'll just have to be bolder.
<Pontang> ;o
<Kabaka> Yes.
<Natleyn> I'm not sure I'll be around tonight :C
<Turgle> me neither :\
<Luna> 07Well, maybe saturday is another option ;)
<Kabaka> Once a few exiting communities pick up on this network as their place for chat, a position is secured.
<Pontang> Go the extra mile for the users would be the best bet.
<Turgle> eeeeyup!
<Natleyn> Yup! :3
<Kabaka> Yep.
<Nashy> That was not my experience, but YMMV
<RobotPinkie> these are like... two movies you can't refuse
<Kabaka> Though that's kind of a brony trait, already. The other networks will have the same idea.
<Luna> 07true that!
<RobotPinkie> and ponies on top of that, holy crap
<Turgle> hey i noticed the new buttons in /theatre/
<Pontang> True.
<Kabaka> They're all young and small, and there's lots of potential traffic. The time to strike is now!
<Kabaka> (I need to calm down)
<Turgle> but the pop-up window isn't working
<Pontang> Well, we're going to need some PR guys.
<Pontang> ;p
<Kabaka> Yeah, definitely.
<Leonon> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xmVO7qjupw
<prince-dari> The buttons work fine. :P
<Luna> 07Might be a browser issue, which one are you using?
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<EspyLacopa> Huh. "Of Two Minds", chapter 7.
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Mass Effect 05 bonus
<EspyLacopa> The Great and Powerful Trixie vs Gilda.
<Turgle> uhm
<Turgle> the buttons open a new tab
<RyanRodriguez> Thank you again for your hospitality and the Stream, and for putting up with me. I look forward to the Season 2 Premiere.
<Turgle> empty
<RyanRodriguez> Bye.
<Luna> 07your welcome
<Luna> 07see you soon!
<Pontang> We're going to try to get the website up as soon as possible. If I get three servers, we'll have 6 leafs to work with.
<prince-dari> Just tested al lthe popouts.
<prince-dari> They all work.
<prince-dari> What browser are you on?
<Turgle> Firefox 6.0.2
<Awesomeshy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wujiEeZje_M
<Awesomeshy> this was posted in #bronystate a while ago
<Awesomeshy> thought I'd share
<Kabaka> As long as their geographically diverse, more servers is always good.
<Pontang> Exactly.
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: That's good stuff. MANLY TEARS.
<Nashy> hax
<Pontang> At the moment, we have servers in LA, Chicago, and Paris?
<mib_someguy> Could somepony kick Natleyn? -sigh-
<Turgle> the error console says:
<Pontang> And Montana
<Pontang> >.>
<Awesomeshy> >tears
<Turgle> popUp is not defined
<Awesomeshy> no tears, just a touched heart
<Pontang> The Montana one is weird.
<Kabaka> Ahaha, Montana
<Turgle> javascript:popUP(' [..] ')
<Turgle> Line 1
<Kabaka> That's on one of those shell hosts isn't it?
<Pontang> Yeah
<Pontang> ;3
<prince-dari> mib_someguy: Kicking the nick does nothing.
<prince-dari> Just wait till it disconnects.
<RobotPinkie> If you mean that clicking "open in new tab" doesn't work, then yes, that's the intended behavior, Turgle
<Awesomeshy> all of the servers right now are on shell hosts
<Turgle> nope, i just click on the link
<mib_someguy> u.u
<Turgle> and it opens a new empty tab
<RobotPinkie> That's weird
<Turgle> wait
<Turgle> ctrl+F5
<Pontang> I'm hoping to get VPSes from LA, Texas/Florida, Chicago, one of the east coast, Canada, and two from Europe (One in the UK and one on the mainland).
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Ah. I looked at who was providing them, and some looked like they could have been on VPSes.
<Turgle> same
<Turgle> no changes :\
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: I suppose I should have picked up on that after all this chat.
<Natleyn> What are you doing? o-o
<Pontang> Kabaka: where is this node you offer from?
<Kabaka> Pontang: That sounds like a good, standard plan.
<Kabaka> Pontang: Let me check where is best
<Turgle> pressing buttons
<Awesomeshy> I got pinkiepie, rainbowdash and uh
<Rainbow_Dash> Next Dead Island quest.. Difficul;ty very hard..; http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/src/131231283447.gif
<Awesomeshy> :| anotherpony not fluttershy
<Awesomeshy> at xzibition.com
<Turgle> but with chrome it works
<Pontang> twilightsparkle you ass.
<Pontang> >=O
<Awesomeshy> oh
<Awesomeshy> right
<Awesomeshy> her
<Awesomeshy> u mad?
<Nittany_Tiger> I did a hard quest w/o dying yesterday.
<Pontang> How can you forget the nerd? T~T
<Kabaka> Pontang: Looks like I have a box in Panama that's been running at like 1% capacity for the last 2 years. 100 megabits, almost perfect uptime, disreputable but technically reliable data center.
<Nittany_Tiger> But those damn thug zombies...
<prince-dari> Turgle: Might be because firefox derps with the type of popup I'm using, give me a sec to change it.
<Pontang> Panama as in Middle Americas?
<Pontang> Or Panama as in Florida.
<Pontang> xD
<Kabaka> I could maybe put it on one of my shared web hosting machines, but I'd rather not. At least until I get more rack space for the stack of machines in my office.
<Turgle> yes, don't worry, take your time
<prince-dari> Ok, I worked out how to fix it.
<RobotPinkie> well that's latest Firefox, so most likely a lot of people are using it.
<Pontang> Well, if we can find cheap/reliable VPSes, we should be able to get the servers from above locations for cheap.
<Luna> 07<< chrome
*AllisZero brohoofs Luna
<AllisZero> <- Chrome too
<prince-dari> If you ctrl + F5 on the theatre page on .net it should work now.
<Pontang> But if it's Panama as in middle America, I suppose there are bronies from South America.
<Turgle> works
<Leonon> See? Mass Effect isn't stable, it crashes if you spawn a tank in the citidel, kill Captain Anderson and try to talk to his disembodied ghost
<Turgle> <3
<Awesomeshy> dat brazil
<Kabaka> Pontang: Infolink. Do a traceroute to vm3.vacantminded.com if you want to see where it is. :|
<Turgle> thanks
<prince-dari> No problem, I'll just update it on the .co.cc site now.
<Awesomeshy> I actually forget about south america a lot
<Nashy> damn!
<Pontang> It's hard not to forget.
<Pontang> ;x
<Impreza> Is zis ze HQ of ze herd?
<Retsamoreh> EqD?
<Retsamoreh> Hm... Yeah.
<Kabaka> Well
<Kabaka> Like I said, I'm about to get new boxes installed somewhere.
<Retsamoreh> It's pretty much the largest pony HQ/blog/news thing.
<Retsamoreh> Some could argue that Ponychan actually is
<EspyLacopa> << Chrome user as well
<Impreza> Zen... zis is my place
<Kabaka> They were supposed to go to QuadraNet, but my contact there is now gone and my good price went away.
<prince-dari> Yeah, I use chrome.
<prince-dari> Anyway, all fixed now.
<Kabaka> So I can't decide if I want to put them elsewhere, or just bit the bullet and pay more.
<Awesomeshy> using chrome
<Natleyn> I mainly use chrome, but I have a bunch more.
<Impreza> ye kno. its just akward when ze mlp:fim haz rule 34
<Pontang> Ah
<Awesomeshy> I just wish chrome had a tab manager like Firefox's mosaic
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm still and FF user, but I'm not a fan of the newer versions.
<Kabaka> I'd offer something in a more central location, but my paying customers come first. :-\
<Nittany_Tiger> *an
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Story: The Light in the Darkness (http://tinyurl.com/3ndftbd)
<Nittany_Tiger> FF5 copied Opera with it's layout.
<Awesomeshy> how much are your rates?
<Pontang> It's fine.
<Nittany_Tiger> And it still hogs memory like hell.
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, I haven't checked that.
<RobotPinkie> once Chrome is finished, I'll use that...
<User_3880> hey guys why pony time begin
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Honestly, if someone were to order space for an IRC network, I'd put them in Panama until I install these new boxes.
*EspyLacopa wishes the RSS feed for Equestria Daily would update when stories update.
<Impreza> what pony time?
<User_3880> my litte pony
<Nashy> FriendShipping..?
<MrPoniator> Epic Pony time
<Natleyn> Dari updates when EqD updates?
<Hayfever> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:20h:57m:58s
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> Yeah I do.
<Kabaka> I may have these machines installed before the month is up, so it might work out anyway.
<Pontang> But anyway, if I buy 3, and Awesomeshy buys 4, we're in good shape.
<prince-dari> But it's not set to do that here yet.
<prince-dari> I'll set it up, sec.
<prince-dari> [17:02] <prince-dari> New EQD Post: Story: The Light in the Darkness
<Kabaka> As long as you've got at least 3 nodes that aren't on cheap shell providers, I think it's all great.
<prince-dari> Still posting in the old server.
<User_3880> my litte pony break all life
<Natleyn> Ahh.
<MrPoniator> Oh my
<Pontang> Well, VPSes obv.
<Turgle> prince-dari, remember that on ponychan the link to Bronystate is http://dinkypage.com/bronystate
<Pontang> I'm buying those three from rapidxen (Probably)
<User_3880> mrponinatro
<prince-dari> Yeah I know. :/
<Impreza> Seriously?
<User_3880> yes
<MrPoniator> ?
<User_3880> are you like ponies
<Kabaka> Awesome
<Retsamoreh> AUuuhgg only seven days to complete my fic
<Awesomeshy> wait
<MrPoniator> I am like a pony, yes
<Pontang> We can set those up with the new network in mind.
<Pontang> ;p
<Awesomeshy> you're buying three servers?
<Impreza> I am too.
<User_3880> are you like my litte ponys
<Pontang> They $8/piece, yeah
<Pontang> ;o
<MrPoniator> I'm your little pony, yes
<Shaico> I am nothing like your little ponies.
<Awesomeshy> oh... k
<Retsamoreh> Actually
<Retsamoreh> I'm a box.
*Awesomeshy I'm not complaining
<Retsamoreh> Not a pony.
<Shaico> Shut up Rets.
<MrPoniator> A box?!
<Retsamoreh> yup
<User_3880> my litte pony is movie
<MrPoniator> What a twist
<Pontang> Need to find other VPS sites that offer reasonably priced servers from the locations we need.
<Retsamoreh> http://tinyurl.com/3g5xa98
<Impreza> what kind of box?
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Lul
<Retsamoreh> that kind of box
<Shaico> XBox!
<mib_i3nmou> wait, are the old servers even still running? irc.bronyserv.co.cc?
<MrPoniator> That's a very nice box
<Retsamoreh> Solid marble, magically enhanced, and 99% sentient.
<Awesomeshy> I love how
<Awesomeshy> I don't understand why anyone would pay that much money
<Turgle> yep
<Impreza> but sad, you're a box D:
<MrPoniator> I like the fic in which Seth is a box and shipped with Trixie
<Iks> anyone wanna cry?
<Awesomeshy> I'm here I'm having to pay ~$40 a month
<Pontang> $24/month? :D
<Retsamoreh> And for the record
<Retsamoreh> I WAS A BOX BEFORE SETH >:l
<Shaico> Iks: If you would like to cry, go ahead.
<prince-dari> Old server is still up so I can redirect people trying to join the wrong place.
<Iks> no i am asking you
<Pontang> Well, if we can get VPSes as cheap as $10 or less, you might get off with less.
*ValtheJean totally wasn't one of those people
<ValtheJean> <.< >.>
<MrPoniator> I'm not feeling that bad, beside having this flu
<mib_i3nmou> oh, weird... i tried to connect a few minutes ago and it didn't work. now it does.
<Shaico> No.
<MrPoniator> So I don't think I'd like to cry
<Shaico> I am happy, but bored.
<User_3880> if you look at my litte pony anymore so you can not ever watch the cessation
<Iks> ok then i wont link it
<MetalRainbowDash> blablablabl
<MetalRainbowDash> http://www.tyea.com
<Impreza> !away
<Awesomeshy> yeah
<Shaico> Link it anyway
<MrPoniator> What's cessation?
<Kabaka> Three RapidXen VPSes would probably be enough for the next year of this network. If usage trends that way, it would make sense to phase out any other nodes until they're needed.
<Shaico> the end
<Kabaka> But I think we already talked about that.
<User_3880> you look FOREVERR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<User_3880> no
<Pontang> True, but to offer other channels the best support. Saying we have 7 servers is better than saying we have 3.
<Pontang> And only two considering one is a hub.
<User_3880> saico
<RobotPinkie> so what IRC server are we supposed to connect to now?
<Turgle> this
<User_3880> shaico
<Turgle> unless other changes
<Pontang> We need to be bold.
<EspyLacopa> Tricycle Sprinkle?
<Kabaka> I suppose. Though one of the rules of hosting is that you purchase to match your peak capacity needs.
<RobotPinkie> No, the address, I mean.
<Kabaka> I guess that's fair.
<Awesomeshy> I'm thinking
<Kabaka> It certainly won't hurt anything.
<Awesomeshy> I'm paying for 4 servers right now
<Shaico> Yes, friend?
<Turgle> irc.bronychat.net
<Awesomeshy> all of them about $12 each
<MrPoniator> English doesn't seem to be one of his stronger languages, I assume
<Turgle> /6667
<RobotPinkie> Thanks
<User_3880> are you alvie
<EspyLacopa> Twine Spatter?
<Awesomeshy> if I should get 2 linode servers
<User_3880> mcponinator
<MrPoniator> Hmm
<MrPoniator> McPoniator
<MrPoniator> That sounds fancy
<Iks> ok then... http://wimp.com/alwaysfamily/ if you at least dont get choked up a bit you have no soul
<User_3880> mrponinator
<Laps|down> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Laps|down!
<Laps|down> AWAY~
<Pontang> Well, we might be able to find cheaper VPSes.
<Pontang> u_u
<MrPoniator> Yes, User_3880?
<Kabaka> Cheaper ≠ better
<Awesomeshy> yeah
<Awesomeshy> also
<Pontang> Obviously
<Kabaka> Well
<Awesomeshy> how many users can we fit on 512MB ram
<Kabaka> Cheaper == worse
<User_3880> have you ever wanted to roof my litte pony
<RobotPinkie> http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/9123/1298189843774.jpg
<Kabaka> That will vary. Quite a few more than you think.
<WhatPayne> Should someone add the "You are in the right place to the topic header"?
<MrPoniator> Excuse me, but what is that supposed to even mean?
<User_3880> nohgtig
<Pontang> But where are linode's servers located?
<User_3880> :C:C
<Nittany_Tiger> Right place for now.
<User_3880> ----dd-
<Kabaka> They've got many locations
<MrPoniator> Ooooookay
<Kabaka> Uh
<Pontang> Ah
<Kabaka> London, GB, UK
<Kabaka> Newark, NJ, USA
<User_3880> ;D
<Retsamoreh> I dunno either, Poniator.
<Kabaka> Atlanta, GA, USA
<Kabaka> Dallas, TX, USA
<Kabaka> Fremont, CA, USA
<Kabaka> Atlanta filters 6667, I believe.
<Awesomeshy> would 2 of the $20 servers hold up with 3k users?
<mib_i3nmou> >implying something will go horribly wrong twice in two days
<User_3880> poninator
<MrPoniator> Where does the extra "n" keep popping up from?
<Kabaka> That would be tight.
<Pontang> I suppose if I get those three, it covers Midland, West Coast, and Europe.
<Pontang> So Newark and Dallas perhaps?
<User_3880> what
<EspyLacopa> O.o Blueblood is roped into helping Ditzy Doo navigate Ponyville to deliver letters.
<VioletVanilla> 6hallo everypony
<MrPoniator> It's just "Variator", ponified
<Awesomeshy> yeah, I like the dallas idea
<AllisZero> Hi Violet
<Awesomeshy> :v
<RobotPinkie> ohay VioletVanilla!
<Turgle> heloo
<Pontang> Would give us a server on the four corners and one in Euro land
<User_3880> mrponinator
<MrPoniator> Yeah?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dari, have I been added to your infernal script yet?
<Kabaka> That seems reasonable.
<prince-dari> Ages ago.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh yey, no warning!
<User_3880> look this http://www.youtube.com/user/PIFTSdotexe#p/u/3/YdZa2phzWe8
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :D
<Awesomeshy> I'll actually be saving a little money by doing this
<Kabaka> Use the Dallas Linode as a US hub?
<Pontang> Probably Chicago.
<Pontang> But if it works better, sur.
<MrPoniator> Pony Thread Simulator v2.0?
<Pontang> sure*
<User_3880> yes
<Pontang> brb
<MrPoniator> Seen it ages ago
<Awesomeshy> I guess it would be a good idea to use a linode server as the hub, everyone keeps telling me they're where I should go for htis
<Awesomeshy> this*
<User_3880> yay
<Kabaka> Between the two, it's kind of a tossup.
<RobotPinkie> oh look, another one of them colored fellers
<User_3880> mrponinator
<Octavia> probably not the best thing to link
<MrPoniator> Yeah?
<Kabaka> Neither one is going to go down or have connectivity problems.
<User_3880> FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<mib_i3nmou> trololo, RobotPinkie
<MrPoniator> Forever what?
<RobotPinkie> :P
<User_3880> my little pony friendship is magic
<Awesomeshy> imo specs wise, the linode servers are a better deal
<MrPoniator> Yep?
<VioletVanilla> 6it is good to see all of you here
<Awesomeshy> even if the others are cheaper
<Fireant> User_3880, I sense a troll in you.
<MrPoniator> And honestly, why do I always start talking with fellows when I'm not even sure what they're trying to say
<Fireant> If I keep sensing that a little more...
<RobotPinkie> good to see you too, VioletVanilla
<Kabaka> They've currently got more purchasing power, so that's unavoidable.
<Awesomeshy> how much resources do you need for a hub in contrast to a leaf?
<MrPoniator> It's like in movies how they ask "Do you speak English" and still keep talking in English
<AllisZero> Hi RP
<MrPoniator> Even though the person they're talking to doesn't understand any of it
<Awesomeshy> I'm sorry btw, this is my first rodeo with irc network administration
<User_3880> All My Little Pony Friendship is Magic look at what it will be forever in you mrponinator
<Kabaka> It's all gouda.
<RobotPinkie> ohay AllisZero
<Kabaka> You'll want about the same for hubs and leaves, really. Some people will disagree, but they're just splitting hairs.
<Awesomeshy> I'm definately willing to learn
<MrPoniator> And level of sense that made is nonexistent
<Awesomeshy> actually wanting to
<Kabaka> Theoretically, the leaves have to talk to many more clients at once, so they have to send and receive more data.
<Kabaka> Hubs see every message once as they pass it on. For large channels, a leaf will have to send that message to many users.
<Kabaka> But bandwidth is going to be abundant with these hosts.
<User_3880> mrponinator
<Awesomeshy> I'm more worried about capping out memory
*MrPoniator pretends he doesn't hear anything
<Kabaka> And as for server capacity, RAM isn't necessarily the biggest thing to look for. Generally, you'll want to care about the number of users per node.
<User_3880> who say forever pinkie pie or appeljack
<Awesomeshy> oh really
<MrPoniator> !link forever
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/22977
<Flutteryay> Thanks
<WhatPayne> Oh, hello VioletVanilla, RobotPinkie
<Flutteryay> Hi everypony
<WhatPayne> Flutteryay too
<MrPoniator> How's that related to fore-...Oh, the artist is muffinsforever
<Kabaka> For medium networks, the usual target is 75 to 100 users per client server. For the big guys, they'll vary a lot. I've seen as many as 3,000 on a single machine. It's real nasty when one of those splits or goes offline.
<Kabaka> s/medium/small/
<User_3880> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
<Kabaka> Most of the 500-5,000 user networks I see aim for around 100-250 users per node.
<Kabaka> This goes back to buying for your peak capacity, though.
<Octavia> !moon User_3880
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, User_3880!
<Flutteryay> OK so I'm composing music in MuseScore (it's the only sheet music composition program available for Macs that I'm aware of) and among its myriad of problems is the fact that... you can't tie chords\\
<MrPoniator> Thank you
<Turgle> ._.
<User_3880> no kick me
<Turgle> are you suuuuure?
<Octavia> hah
<Kabaka> If you have 500,000 people online, you'll want to get a bunch of really huge dedicated servers, not 100,000 small VPS machines.
<Octavia> fuuu my /kick is borked.
<Flutteryay> Not in MuseScore
<Turgle> ._.
<Ali1017> oh fun
<Flutteryay> When you try to it deletes the other notes in the chord
<Ali1017> double kick
<Octavia> eh, ill fix it later
<MrPoniator> troll-or-so-level: 0/10
<Octavia> Ponyfan, you are dense.
<Leika> Mooooooooorning everypony!
<Turgle> well that's pretty unusual for a score program
<Ponyfan> moornig
*Ali1017 is slow on the kick
<Flutteryay> Eeyup
<Sketchy_Sounds> Guys!
<MrPoniator> ?
<Kabaka> If we're planning for 1,000 users in the near future, I'd say we go for four second-tier VPSes. That's 250 users per server, assuming there's also a hidden hub.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Guess who got a new mic :D
<Octavia> woo!
<Kabaka> 512 MB could hold that.
<Octavia> guess who was about to sleep?
<MrPoniator> Is that mic any good?
*Octavia pouts
<Flutteryay> Frustrating
<Turgle> you should try something else
<Sketchy_Sounds> The mic is good, yes. When using Ustream the level monitors meter actually registers it.
<Kabaka> There would probably still be some breathing room, too.
<Turgle> like fruity loops, or better, reason
<VioletVanilla> Flutteryay
<Kabaka> It's really hard to say without knowing how fast we'll grow
<VioletVanilla> 6Try getting Finale Notepad
<Kabaka> I'm rambling. Sorry.
<Awesomeshy> very helpful rambling
<VioletVanilla> 6It works on Mac and is a free program for scoring music. I have used it for many musical projects.
<Flutteryay> Hmm... well, my music theory teacher did make a passing reference to it but she uses MuseScore
<Flutteryay> lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> Although
<VioletVanilla> 6http://www.finalemusic.com/NotePad/Demo.aspx
<Flutteryay> I shall check it out
<Flutteryay> thanks
<Sketchy_Sounds> I don't have time to stream right now
<MrPoniator> :p
<Sketchy_Sounds> Will do later tonight
<VioletVanilla> 6What are you going for dearie? In school I mean
<MrPoniator> What'cha gonna stream?
<Octavia> yay, ill be at work all night -.-
<Flutteryay> I'm majoring in music technology
<Turgle> :O
<Turgle> awesome
*Ali1017 pat pats Octavia.
<VioletVanilla> 6Fantastic! What instrument?
<Flutteryay> The focus is on using a computer.
<Flutteryay> So GarageBand, Logic Pro...
<VioletVanilla> 6Well, yes I understand that. . .
<Flutteryay> Guitar for me.
<Flutteryay> There's a ton of Bronies at my university
<MrPoniator> Hmm
<Ponyfan> who talk me'
<Turgle> ahahah really?
<VioletVanilla> 6but the Uni I go to, where I am majoring in Piano Performance/Composition, you must have a main instrument
<Flutteryay> Yeah
<Turgle> xD
<MrPoniator> Thinking of ways how to insert some MLP related messages to a game I'm doing
<VioletVanilla> 6that is interesting to hear, glad we have another music brony :3
<Kabaka> I'm hardly an expert on IRC capacity planning.
<Flutteryay> Eeyup
<Flutteryay> Daniel Ingram is such an inspiration to me
<Turgle> :3
<Turgle> he's good
<Kabaka> My network hit 500-1000 users a few years ago when we were linked with a much larger group.
<Kabaka> But it's been 300 users the rest of its life.
<MrPoniator> Likely going to name one fellow Steven Magnet, for instance
<Flutteryay> Eeeeeeyup
<Kabaka> So I'm pretty much just guessing based on general knowledge of service hosting. :-\
<Kabaka> Argh, EqD still has the old address.
<Ponyfan> I guess what I have two computers an look my little pony friendship is magic movie
<MrPoniator> >movie
<Ponyfan> yes
<MrPoniator> And yeah, isn't that like avoiding kicks, User_3880?
<Ponyfan> no
<MrPoniator> Care to say what's your native language?
<VioletVanilla> 6Daniel Ingram and many others I presume!
<Ponyfan> im use google translator
<Ponyfan> an im from finland
<MrPoniator> Jaaha, miksi käyttää noin surkeaa kääntäjää?
<Ponyfan> hä
<Ramenshy> ah, college food
<MrPoniator> Ei se google translate osaa kääntää Suomesta mihinkään kieleen järkevästi
<Ponyfan> hääh
<Ponyfan> mitä
<MrPoniator> Sitäpä sitä
<Ponyfan> ottko suomalainen
<MrPoniator> Juu, perisyntyinen suomalainen
<Flutteryay> Yeah
<Ali1017> Lets keep the chat in english please.
<MrPoniator> Yeah, sorry
<Ponyfan> jaa
<MrPoniator> #EqD.Suomi
<Kabaka> Haha
<Ponyfan> senkö takia luulin sua englatilaseks
<MrPoniator> Tulos tuonne väliaikaisesti
<Kabaka> I should get some food. It's my time for dinner.
<VioletVanilla> 6What other ponies do you like?
<Ponyfan> joo
<Ramenshy> It's lunch time here
<Charlie_Horse> Good morning.
<Ponyfan> mrponinator
<AllisZero> Amazing how things spiral out of control
<Kabaka> Most people here would probably agree with you. I don't operate on a normal schedule, though: http://kylej.name/i/1r244s.png
<AllisZero> So easily luls
<MrPoniator> Kirjoita /join #EqD.Suomi, jos et ole tottunut IRC chatteihin tai jotain. Koitetaan pitää tämä chatti englanninkielisenä, ja en oikein google translaten tason englannilla suosittelisi jutteleen täällä
<Flutteryay> Dave Mustaine, Shiro Sagisu, Taku Iwasaki, Yoko Kanno...
<MrPoniator> Gonna stop talking in Finnish on this channel now
<Flutteryay> A ton of metal and anime
<Ramenshy> what time zone are you in?
<Kabaka> CST (GMT-5 currently)
<Ramenshy> oh
<Ramenshy> so you're just an hour behind me
<Ramenshy> or ahead
<Kabaka> Fri Sep 9 11:39:02 CDT 2011
<Ramenshy> wat
<Ramenshy> neither
<Kabaka> wat wat
<Ramenshy> same time
<Ramenshy> GMT-6
<Ramenshy> do I fail to understand time zones
<Kabaka> Daylight saving time
<Ramenshy> fffffffffffffffffffffffff-
<Kabaka> That's why I said "currently"
<Zephirdd> chat is so empty compared to yesterday D:
<Ramenshy> that always trips me up
<VioletVanilla> 6Yoko Kanno was my inspiration to take my secondary instrument, double bass, and learn it.
<Zephirdd> TONIGHT we watch movies :3
<Ramenshy> :c
<Kabaka> Yeah
<Nittany_Tiger> Dave Mustaine is a brony? Is this rumor?
<Kabaka> It's dumb.
<Kabaka> I try to use UTC wherever possible.
<Pontang> u_u
<Flutteryay> Awesome
<Kabaka> Also, I tried extra hard to confuse you by saying CST instead of CDT
<Turgle> xD
<Turgle> ahuauha
<Ramenshy> oh u
<AllisZero> Turgle, are you BR?
<Flutteryay> I'm actually kind of afraid to find out Mr. Mustaine's opinions on Bronies
<Pontang> <Kabaka> If we're planning for 1,000 users in the near future, I'd say we go for four second-tier VPSes. That's 250 users per server, assuming there's also a hidden hub. <--- Well, 5 leafs if you include your's. But that's up to you. :p
<Turgle> maybe he is in this chatroom right now
<prince-dari> Timezones would be simple if everyone stuck to GMT ± a number.
<Turgle> BR?
<Pontang> You do tracerouting before you link servers right?
<Flutteryay> and on gay people for that matter, considering he's a Christian... who follows Alex Joones
<AllisZero> If you don't know then no, it was just coincidence lol
<Kabaka> That's often a good idea, yes.
<Turgle> wat
<Pontang> Yeah
<Pontang> :p
<Turgle> TELL ME
<Turgle> pleeeeease
<RobotPinkie> lol Mustaine is nuts, no offence
<VioletVanilla> 6Uh oh. . .
<prince-dari> Mustaine?
<prince-dari> Who's he?
<RobotPinkie> I love Megadeth, though
<AllisZero> BR is the way brazillians call themselves online
<Pontang> Got an interesting month ahead.
*VioletVanilla sees Religion on the screen
<AllisZero> That laugh is very notoriously known for it
<Pontang> Hopefully we can get the website fully operational and whatnot.
<Turgle> OH
<Turgle> no i'm italian :D
<AllisZero> (I know 'cause I'm one of them, just living in the states)
<Kabaka> :D
<Pontang> Also, need to find some PR guys in the future.
<Pontang> That'll be interesting.
<RobotPinkie> lol VioletVanilla trying to get a fight going :P
<Kabaka> Yeah.
<Kabaka> Also need a TOS of some kind.
<Pontang> Yeah
<VioletVanilla> 6oh no i am not. . .
<Pontang> I'm reluctant if we should allow DCC stuff. Well, for MLP and ish (Not warez obv)
<RobotPinkie> if Bruce Dickinson wants more cowbell, I think we should give him more cowbell
<Kabaka> Top priority should be a favicon for the site, though. It's totally screwing up my textless bookmarks bar.
<VioletVanilla> 6i have my own beliefs and stand by them, but if it is in a chatroom. . . .~.
<VioletVanilla> 6END OF LINE
<AllisZero> EOF
<Ramenshy> does anyone even use DCC?
<Ramenshy> I never have
<Kabaka> I use it for managing my bots, but that's it.
<Pontang> Use it quite a bit on rizon. ;3
<WhatPayne> Easy for you, Violet, you are a mod.
<Kabaka> Rizon :-(
<Ramenshy> lol Kabaka
<VioletVanilla> 6What does that mean?
<Kabaka> I do what I can to distance myself from Rizon users.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 shhhhh....don't tell them about our super special rings that grant us super-human powers
<Pontang> I really don't go there tbh.
<Pontang> I know people on there.
<Ramenshy> did you have a bad experience?
<Pontang> That's it.
<VioletVanilla> 6. . .
<Turgle> oh my xD
*VioletVanilla hugs ValtheJean
<WhatPayne> What ValtheJean said
<RobotPinkie> Why of course.
<Pontang> I've always been on small 200-300 user networks.
<Kabaka> Ramenshy: Not directly. But their reputation is well-earned.
<Nittany_Tiger> I just realized that I wore my nightshirt to school XD
<VioletVanilla> 6^.~ Our little secret~
<Nittany_Tiger> Good thing they're like my day shirts.
<WhatPayne> Who knows what kinds of power you have...
<Ramenshy> please explain, I've never cared about rizon to hear anything about them
<Kabaka> Ramenshy: I trust you're familiar with their grand ventures of IRC domination and the subsequent jail time, right?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, what did you think we all did after streams? have tea parties. Nah dawg, we're defending the multiverse from the evil forces of SHEISE'GURLAKKAKAMUG
<WhatPayne> You walk among us mortals...
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate mornings. Can't function in the morning.
<WhatPayne> Luckily it's evening.
<Ramenshy> no, but this sounds like something you could write novels about
<Kabaka> Ramenshy: Since apparently not, here's the appropriate (and brief) section of a Wikipedia article on them: http://j.mp/p5WCKs
<Pontang> Yep
<RobotPinkie> That is so last week
<Pontang> IRC isn't worth that sort of thing.
<Pontang> Hardly any money to be made. xD
<RobotPinkie> This week the stars finally align, and he who is not dead but sleeping awakens from his slumber
<Ramenshy> hahaha oh wow
<EspyLacopa> Oho, a new chapter of Hoennshy
<Ramenshy> who cares that much
<Kabaka> Yeah
<Ramenshy> that they'd do that
<Pontang> Scratch that, no money.
<Pontang> It's a money waster.
<Pontang> xD
<Kabaka> > Downey faced up to 24 months in prison and a fine of up to $40,000.
<Kabaka> Yeah, that's pretty much terrible.
<RobotPinkie> Then the world as we know it ends, most of the human race is eaten and the rest of us are made into slaves.
<EspyLacopa> Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash broke the game.
<Ramenshy> wow
<Ramenshy> just wow
<Pontang> I don't think anyone has made a way to make cash though IRC.
<Pontang> Well
<WhatPayne> Anywho. Always in here, I'll hold my tongue when it comes to certain subjects no matter how much I'd like to start arguments over them... Love and Tolerance and whatnot
<Pontang> Not the ones who run the networks.
<Pontang> The providers maybe.
<Amethyst> Anything important being discussed or can I kind of hijack the chat with something?
<Kabaka> Hosting IRC is tricky.
<Charlie_Horse> Nothin' important right now.
<MrPoniator> Nah, nothing going on here right now
<Kabaka> You gotta be big enough to swallow the inevitable DDOS attacks or you'll just get squashed off the Internet
<Amethyst> Ok so have any of the younger bronies out there met opposition from their parents?
<Turgle> remember, we are gonna tolerate and love the shit outta you
<WhatPayne> Exactly
<MrPoniator> Hmm
<Kabaka> Quite a few datacenters completely disallow anything even indirectly related to IRC because of that.
<MrPoniator> Who are young here anyway
<Pontang> x_x
<RobotPinkie> I don't love and tolerate everyone :P
<Kabaka> Then there's the guys like Staminus that are full of dirty networks, so they are constantly eating 500 gigabits of UDP
<Kabaka> (hint: don't buy Staminus servers)
<EspyLacopa> This world is made of. . .LOVE AND PEACE! <insert Vash pose>
<Turgle> i love & tolerate just bronies
<Pontang> :p
<Amethyst> Well I'm in high school but my parents are SERIOUSLY opposed to ponies...
<RobotPinkie> but arguing online tends to be stupid, so...
<RobotPinkie> oh man, I need to watch Trigun again...
<Kabaka> Freenode servers get hammered 24/7
<Eights> Punch them in the snout to establish superiority
<MPR|> fuck that, Pinkie Pie does what she wants!
<RobotPinkie> that was an awesome show
<MrPoniator> I'm pretty sure if I said anything about ponies to my mother, she'd go all "d'aaawww" or something
<MrPoniator> My dad, hmm, not sure
<Pontang> I think with the 5 servers we buy + whatever you offer, we should be fine for what we need.
<Kabaka> Apparently when you're in the process of joining, they tell you to be ready to accept 2 to 8 gigabits of attack at all times.
<MrPoniator> Though, he already knows I've some unconventional tastes
<Kabaka> I think so too
<Pontang> u_u
<WhatPayne> Isn't that supposed to be the brony mentality. Love and Tolerate?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 depends on the brony
<Kabaka> The network will undoubtedly change and adapt as time goes on.
<Kabaka> Initial stability is key, though.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 initially, that was just an anti-troll measure
<EspyLacopa> Vash the Stampede would definitely be a brony.
<Pontang> Might get one in Canada and the UK, but otherwise, we should really support most of what we want.
<Pontang> Yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 since then, it has evolved into a mantra that some bronies accept, others dont
<Amethyst> Well to put into perspective, my parents had a "talk" with me around midnight about how it was childish and I should stop.
<WhatPayne> It's nicer to be nicer even when all are not nice.
<MrPoniator> I like to quote one fellow from a talkshow "Uutisvuoto"
<MrPoniator> "An adult who refuses to play is being childish"
<RobotPinkie> It's nice to give people the benefit of the doubt
<Eights> force them to watch the entire season and i dare them to not lose it when twi introduces herself to fluttershy
<RobotPinkie> but inviting Charles Manson over for tea, and agreeing to showing him your knife collection......
<MrPoniator> Showing the show doesn't solve it every time, to be honest
<Turgle> LOL
<Amethyst> My dad says he's read some stuff on it and it's a really bad thing to be into. I think my parents are afraid that every brony is a pedophile and that i'll become one too. i know for a fact both of those are false.
<MPR|> i prefer the c.s. lewis quote
<MrPoniator> If they're too fixated on the "childish" aspect, it's not as simple as that
<prince-dari> ^
<prince-dari> The CS Lewis quote it king.
<prince-dari> is*
<MPR|> "When I became a man, I put away childish things, such as the fear of appearing childish."
<WhatPayne> I'll be nice to Manson and decline the offer and nicely notify the authorities.
<MrPoniator> That's a good one too
<RobotPinkie> I need to play Read Dead Redemption again....
<prince-dari> My parents aren't bothered that I like MLP.
<Amethyst> They say it isn't normal and it's going to isolate me from my friends.
<RobotPinkie> Never did take 100% :(
<WhatPayne> I have been contemplating of playing that game through again as well.
<WhatPayne> It's really brilliant
<prince-dari> My mum even came back from shopping and told me they had ponies at Tesco the other day.
<Eights> it...it encourages friendship though
<LunaOnTheMoon> My parents give me a hard time, but only in jest.
<prince-dari> Hah, my dad jokes around with me.
<RobotPinkie> one of my favorite games of all time, most likely
<prince-dari> "Ponies, and porn, I bet you'd like that, sexy ponies? My little porn!"
<WhatPayne> I know, right?
<prince-dari> porny*
<prince-dari> My dad's pretty funny.
<RobotPinkie> The ending to it was just... amazing. Like not just the ending, but the 15 or so missions leading up to it
<AllisZero> I think not even FiM would make me tolerate everyone.
<prince-dari> We joke a lot anyway.
<Awesomeshy> man I got a C# project to work on
<Awesomeshy> why haven't I done it yet
<Eights> he sounds cool
<RobotPinkie> not gonna spoil it though, lolz
<Turgle> ^
<Turgle> tolerate everyone is impossible
<Pontang> Kabaka: does rapidxen allow for prepaid credit cards?
<Amethyst> I wish my parents joked around with me... It was scary how serious my parents were being with me... Any suggestions?
<MPR|> That's when you start sweating awkwardly and hoping that you didn't forget to use incognito or clear your history.
<WhatPayne> It's just shame that I have bunch of other games waiting to be finished.
<prince-dari> I loved RDR.
<prince-dari> But the PoP games are probably my favourites.
<prince-dari> Or Spyro 1/2/3.
<prince-dari> They don't make games that good any more. ;___;
<Amethyst> Lol @ MPR|
<RobotPinkie> I love the PoP games, too
<Turgle> aaaaaah, back in my days
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Makkon Interview (http://tinyurl.com/3kactfz)
<WhatPayne> Turgle Of course it is. But I see it as when ever I get into the argument I never let other side get under my skin and will keep my cool
<RobotPinkie> and I dunno...
<Turgle> Half-Life
<Turgle> 1
<Kabaka> Pontang: I believe so. As long as it works like a credit card, they probably don't care.
<Amethyst> Any suggestions?
<RobotPinkie> It just pains me to see that the only people doing fun puzzle platformers anymore are Nintendo
<DashApples> Howdy
<RobotPinkie> why no new Banjo Kazooie or Mario 64 clones? it boggles the mind...
<WhatPayne> Define platformer...
<Pontang> Yeah
<Pontang> I had issues with my card last time.
<prince-dari> I dunno what to say really, because it depends on who you're trying to convince. There's not just one standard thing that will work will all problems with parents/family/friends.
<prince-dari> I know what I'd do.
<Pontang> It kept rejecting it for some reaosn.
<prince-dari> But that might not work out for you.
<Pontang> reason*
<Kabaka> Huh. Annoying.
<Nittany_Tiger> I have A TON of unfinished games dating back years since purchase.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 why clone them when you can just re-release them 10000 times? There. I've just summed up Nintendo's marketting strategy
<RobotPinkie> well, 3D platformers... 2D platformers there are plenty of
<Amethyst> Any idea is an idea, and that's more than I have right now.
<Pontang> Something about batch or whatever.
<Pontang> Bleh
<Kabaka> Authorization charges can cause that.
<RobotPinkie> because of Steam, XBLA and PSN
<Pontang> u_u
<Kabaka> It depends on the card, your agreement with the card provider, and the funds available.
<Pontang> I do not have a paypal account, so meh me.
<Kabaka> Short version: It's annoying
<RobotPinkie> but like Banjo Kazooie, those games border on perfection :(
<Kabaka> PayPal can be good stuff.
<Nittany_Tiger> Plus indie freeware.
<prince-dari> I'd just be casual about it, not try to hide it, watch it on TV in the same room as them.
<Pontang> Or the very least, I do not have a bank account.
<Pontang> Thus no verification.
<Pontang> Paypal guest is great.
<Kabaka> Ah. Well get one. Bank accounts are awesome.
<Pontang> Don't feel like it. ;cx
<prince-dari> If you don't make it to be a big deal - it's just a show you like - I think it's reasonable to assume they won't make too big a deal out of it too.
<WhatPayne> Well I don't think I have played proper platformer in ages.
<prince-dari> But as I said.
<Awesomeshy> man
<prince-dari> That's just me.
<Awesomeshy> bank accounts rule
<Kabaka> Totally.
<prince-dari> Hey eXAKR.

<Amethyst> Thanks for the help everypony, I guess I'll just have to wait and see what turns out.
<WhatPayne> Would Mirror's Edge count as 3D platformer?
<RobotPinkie> Nuts & Bolts is a very good game, btw, it's just not a platformer...
<Amethyst> Best pony is every pony.
<WhatPayne> Because I just loved that game
<Pontang> Looks like rapidxen takes google checkout? Might be able to use the card then.
<Turgle> FreezeFrame, the chat has been moved to irc.bronychat.net
<Awesomeshy> should I sleep or drink coffee
<RobotPinkie> I do like Mirror's Edge a lot, but most of the fun is had in the trial missions
<Pontang> Coffee ho, that website isn't making itself.
<Pontang> xDX
<Charlie_Horse> Very much.
<Awesomeshy> xfd right right
<RobotPinkie> story mode... kinda dodgy
<Awesomeshy> I should probably get get back to working on that
<Awesomeshy> :v
<Nittany_Tiger> I need to get that game back though I never finished it.
<WhatPayne> Yeah there were flaws especially with the story. But the game mechanic was simply fantastic
<Awesomeshy> anyone feel like making a favacon for me?
<Kabaka> What did you have in mind?
<TuxOtaku> prince-dari, my parents have no idea that my brother and I are into MLP. We intend to keep it that way.
<TuxOtaku> as it is, I barely tell my parents anything
<Awesomeshy> get a big hat
<prince-dari> To me if you hide it that just makes it seem like something strange, wrong, dirty.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, doing time trials on those crazy hovering tracks is a whole ton of fun
<Awesomeshy> rarity seems to like big hats
<WhatPayne> It's the kind of game you can finish with relative ease. But to get the technique right takes some serious practice.
<prince-dari> It's not.
<TuxOtaku> prince-dari, everything to my parents is strange
<prince-dari> All you're doing is watching a TV show.
<kkfreak> Every pony :D
<TuxOtaku> they don't agree with pretty much anything I do.
<Awesomeshy> but seriously uh
<WhatPayne> When you manage to get through whole level in the "flow" it's fantastic experience.
<Kabaka> I know what video you watched, recently. :D
<RobotPinkie> I tried to get the "test of Faith" trophy on my first run through Mirror's Edge.... definitely wasn't easy :P
<Amethyst> I know how you feel, tux...
<TuxOtaku> they still think I'm wasting my time working in IT.
<TuxOtaku> I just plain don't talk to them unless I need to.
<RobotPinkie> playing through it again after, I realized how big a difference guns made
<Amethyst> I think this is the link you were looking for mrponiator https://docs.google.com/document/d/14XCse2gA-GkyDq_TwlPZ8DJivPW8Wtu4MURp8bhbxU0/edit?authkey=CPSCxIgD&hl=en_US&pli=1
<Amethyst> Same
<WhatPayne> Pfft. Never used guns
<prince-dari> I played mirror's edge for a bit.
<prince-dari> Wasn't that impressed.
<TuxOtaku> and I hate to say it...but sometimes I wish my gf's parents were my parents.
<TuxOtaku> 'cos they're awesome
<WhatPayne> But it's one of those games I actually have come back again and again simply to feel the flow
<TuxOtaku> her dad is a bit gruff, but at least he'll have a drink with you
<Amethyst> Haha my gf's parents are worse than mine but I know what you mean
<RobotPinkie> I'd hope for a Mirror's Edge 2 where they fix all the problems with the first one... but it's not gonna happen
<Awesomeshy> ahahaha
<MrPoniator> Yeah, that one Amethyst
<MrPoniator> Thanks
<TuxOtaku> my gf's parents are awesome. Her mom can be a bit ditzy but she's fun
<RobotPinkie> EA owns DICE, so.
<TuxOtaku> her dad is cool...guy's a regular macgyver
<Pontang> ShadowIRCd is an IRC daemon package. It is a modern reboot of the old ShadowIRCd project and is now based on Charybdis IRCd. ShadowIRCd mainly adds many new features on top of Charybdis. We also highly value clean code and not pointless complexity. <--- That's neat. o.o
<WhatPayne> I hope so too. My only fear is that they are going to make the game mechanic too simple and too in the tube
<NightmareMoon> Today it is you, the viewers, who will get to choose what Nightmare Moon does today! Does she: A. Play Space Marines; B. Watch a Movie; C. Play World of Tanks; Or D. Banish to the Moon? ANSWER NOW!
<Nittany_Tiger> You think EA is telling DICE what to make?
<Turgle> probably
<WhatPayne> They certainly are.
<FreezeFrame> Banish to the Sun you mean
<Michael89pl|AFK> C.
<FreezeFrame> again?
<TuxOtaku> he built a sausage-making machine out of an old baby-changing table, a tomato sauce machine and a fridge motor.
<NightmareMoon> !moon FreezeFrame\
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, FreezeFrame\!
<NightmareMoon> BANISHED!
<Charlie_Horse> B.
<NightmareMoon> Aww
<Turgle> eeeeeyup
<NightmareMoon> Failed that one
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<FreezeFrame> Can we just keep it on one freaking server for more than a day?
<NightmareMoon> We have one for tanking, and one for movie time!
<RobotPinkie> they are FULLY owned by EA, so yeah
<prince-dari> Lulz FreezeFrame got mooned.
<WhatPayne> The reason EA "axed" ME2 was so that dice would make Battlefield 3
<HaysforPonies> A
<NightmareMoon> We're all tied up, with FreezeFrame wishing to be banished to the moon!
<Nittany_Tiger> So DICE will be making BF games like almost every Activision developer will be making Call of Duty games.
<Fluttershy> Wow. really not too many people on right now or anything. o-o Nonetheless.. hi!
<RobotPinkie> though DICE presumably likes making Battlefield, since it makes them money :P
<prince-dari> D!
<WhatPayne> Hello Fluttershy
<Amethyst> B
<RobotPinkie> ohay flutter
<BlueJay> B.
<NightmareMoon> !moon FreezeFrame
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, FreezeFrame!
<Fluttershy> Hi. ^^ What's up?
<Awesomeshy> I wonder how that feels to people working on an open source project
<NightmareMoon> !moon prince-dari
<WhatPayne> Of course, but I think DICE is like any developer. They really want to make good interesting games
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, prince-dari!
<NightmareMoon> Wishes granted!
<Awesomeshy> I know that's one of the whole reasons of open source but
<Pontang> u_u
<NightmareMoon> !kill prince-dari
<Awesomeshy> gosh
<prince-dari> :P
*DerpyBot grabs prince-dari and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
<Nittany_Tiger> But that doesn't make money.
<prince-dari> That's a bit harsh
<Awesomeshy> I'd hate to spend all that time
*DerpyBot returns with a cupcake with prince-dari's name etched into the frosting
<RobotPinkie> kinda sad, because it takes a couple of good games to make a good franchise
<Pontang> So many IRCd software to choose from.
<WhatPayne> Yeah. Money is not everything
<Pontang> Ehh, it's experience, right?
<prince-dari> Do I taste good?
<Awesomeshy> and then someone come and just add like 2 new things and call it their own
<Nittany_Tiger> It is to EA and Activision.
<Nittany_Tiger> Tell Kotick that money isn't everything.
<RobotPinkie> first game never makes as much money as an improved sequel
<WhatPayne> But unfortunately the guys making games are not the guys deciding which games to make
<Nittany_Tiger> He'll bawl laughing.
<FreezeFrame> anyway, time to go back to catchup on my Accounting
<NightmareMoon> The votes are in! We had one vote for Space Marines! Three votes for a Movie! One vote for Tanks! And Two ponies banished to the moon!
<FreezeFrame> I added the class 2 weeks in, and missed 2 chapters
<TuxOtaku> I thought we didn't speak of cupcakes in here.
<NightmareMoon> We don't
<prince-dari> If you didn't want that to happen, you wouldn't make it opensource.
<prince-dari> :P
<Nittany_Tiger> The guys deciding are ones that may never play games.
<NightmareMoon> Unless it's the command
<NightmareMoon> The !kill command
<Awesomeshy> lol that's true
<Nittany_Tiger> Just making money off of a commodity.
<RobotPinkie> well money makes the world go round
<TuxOtaku> still
<WhatPayne> Exactly Nittany_Tiger
<NightmareMoon> !kill TuxOtaku
*DerpyBot grabs TuxOtaku and flies off in the general direction of Sugarcube Corner
<Rainbow_Dash> Shouldnt we be getting a new Season 2 pic today?
<TuxOtaku> seems a bit hypocritical
<Zephirdd> so.. huh, why the srver change?
*DerpyBot returns with a cupcake with TuxOtaku's name etched into the frosting
*Rainbow hates money
<Pontang> If I was to make open source software, it would be for the sake of experience only and perhaps to create something knowing people will use it.
<Pontang> If not, I'd sell it. :p
<RobotPinkie> oh that's right :O
<Nittany_Tiger> You won't hate money when you have to make it in order to survive.
<Nittany_Tiger> But the concept is starting to suck.
<Pontang> But there are a lot of open source freaks out there. ;)
<Kabaka> And that's how software licenses are picked :D
<Kabaka> Yeah, there really are.
<Rainbow> Thats why I hate it Nittany_Tiger
<prince-dari> >implying you need money to survive
<Pontang> Honestly, that's all I use anymore.
<prince-dari> Go become self sufficient. :P
<Kabaka> Same. I barely use anything that's closed.
<Pontang> Really do not need to pay $200 for MS office when Libreoffice is free. ;x
<WhatPayne> Yes. We are in or closing to breaking point in game industry
<Nittany_Tiger> I am 80% self-sufficient.
<WhatPayne> hopefully
<Kabaka> Open source doesn't mean free, but that's very true.
<Nittany_Tiger> I hope the gaming industry collapses.
<Rainbow> I'm like 100%
<Kabaka> s/free/zero cost/
<Pontang> Free = anything I do not pay for. xD
<Nittany_Tiger> At least the AAA portion.
<Awesomeshy> I get whatever works better

<prince-dari> Text colours are so that when there are 300 people talking at the same time people can still notice mods talking.
<prince-dari> Only the mods can use colours.
<Kabaka> lol wot
*RobotPinkie ponypounces VioletVanilla
<Kabaka> That's what channel modes are for
<prince-dari> The channel mode to strip control codes also strips it from ops/owners, etc.
<prince-dari> +m is bad.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I was just saying that ferromagnetic materials aren't a prerequisite to magnetism, lolz
<Kabaka> No, I mean like +o and +v
<Natleyn> Hello again~
<Fluttershy> Oh dear... can I share the song that I have stuck in my head...? e-e; It's not bad I promise. It's pony related.
<prince-dari> How does +o or +v help?
<Kabaka> It differentiates the "mods"
<prince-dari> When there are 300 people talking at the same time you don't note immediately the names of whoever is speaking.
<WhatPayne> Ok, I'm not really dumdum, but what does the magnetic field compose of?
<Kabaka> Adds a nice little symbol before their name, and lets users decide if they want their client to add extra formatting
<RobotPinkie> Please do, Fluttershy
<prince-dari> No on mibbit.
<prince-dari> Which is what most of the users will be on.
<Kabaka> Ah
<Kabaka> Well then

<Kabaka> If you're specifically setting white backgrounds and everyone already has one, that's hilarious
<Awesomeshy> I just have a transparent terminal window, black tint, and lime green text
<WhatPayne> And the lastest one I've found is the Fluttershy's Lament which I can't stop listening
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Not you

<Turgle> Hey
<Turgle> awesome video xD
<prince-dari> Mibbit users are on a black background.

<Fluttershy> Oooh Dr. Suess cartoons! I love these things! ^^
<Awesomeshy> hey Kabaka what irc client are you using?
<Pontang> Kane*
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: Weechat
<RobotPinkie> I knew it had a following, I just thought they were all crazy losers... no offence
<Fluttershy> I grew up reading the books as a kid~ Man I miss them.
<RD888> Im watching MLP on my tv right now :)
<Awesomeshy> have you used irssi?
<wolfinponysclothing> !s2
<Kabaka> Yes. I found it to be lacking. :-\
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:19h:25m:35s
<Kabaka> Well, no
<BlueJay> Things look rather slow in the chat right now...
<RobotPinkie> I'd just seen an article and a clip from some news show on Youtube, lolz
<Natleyn> RD888, on Hub?
<EspyLacopa> Yup, a Dr. Suess cartoon about a very stupid capitalist.
<Kabaka> I found it to be excellent
<Jigglysaint> Hi
<Kabaka> But then I tried Weechat, and found it to be better.
<wolfinponysclothing> hi
<RD888> Yeah
<Jigglysaint> man do I feel depressed right now
<RD888> On the hub its winter wrap up!
<BlueJay> Hello.

<Awesomeshy> I should give weechat a try then
<wolfinponysclothing> im sorry to hear that
<Charlie_Horse> Hi here.
<roushguy> What's wrong, Jigglysaint?
<Charlie_Horse> Aww, why's that?
<Kabaka> Possibly.
<Jigglysaint> well nothing serious
<Natleyn> Yeah, I'm watching too. :3
<BlueJay> Anything we can do to make you feel better?
<Awesomeshy> would it be in the fedora repos or do I have to compile from source
<RD888> :)
<Kabaka> #weechat is always full of irssi converts.
<Jigglysaint> well I was at my cousin's birthday last night
<RobotPinkie> I don't have the hub :(
<Fluttershy> I'm pretty sure I have the Hub on my TV at home... not entirely sure yet
<Kabaka> I'm not sure. It updates often, so Fedora repos probably have something ancient
<Jigglysaint> it kind of reminded me of how I am kind of pathetic
<Kabaka> 0.3.5 is current
<EspyLacopa> Song!
<RD888> YAY!
<BlueJay> How so?
<RD888> IS runnin out
<RobotPinkie> I only have the episodes downloaded in HD, with zero commercial breaks :(
<Nashy> Haha this anime Futurama is hilarious.
<RD888> This fashions getting old
<Jigglysaint> well he's had a much more privilaged life than me
*RobotPinkie cries
<Awesomeshy> it is a console application right
<Jigglysaint> and I guess it just gets to me sometimes
<Natleyn> Apparently we get it with our basic cable. :(

*VioletVanilla hugs Fluttershy back gently. I am alright, a bit sick and stressed with some things but okay for now. How are you? n.n
<RobotPinkie> lol

<Fluttershy> e-e;

<Kabaka> Yeah. It's similar to irssi in that way.

<Awesomeshy> thatnks the main reason I use irssi. I never saw a point in usinga gui for something that only handles text

<wolfinponysclothing> i agree with bliejay
<BlueJay> It's not what you have in life what matters, but what you do with it.

<prince-dari> I dunno, maybe it's unfair to judge it when I know nothing about it, but it sounds to me like one of those things that all the experts in an area say is "Amazing", "the best", etc, but most other people don't see it that way, like shitty modern art which is apparently amazing.
<Charlie_Horse> I know what you mean.
<Jigglysaint> it's hard to hear of people, and their vacations to far away places

<BlueJay> I may gat sad from time to time, but I remember the things that make me happy and concentrate on them rather than the things that make me frown.
<Kabaka> It's inside tmux, not that it really matters.
<Jigglysaint> you know, you really don't know the theripudic power of ponies untill you get sad
<RD888> 0 0So
<Rainbow_Dash> Fluttershy, that song is supposed to be Rainbow Dash singing
<MetalRainbowDash> Sorry
<RobotPinkie> but no one cares about Applejack, obviously...
<MetalRainbowDash> It redirected me somewhere
<MetalRainbowDash> What were you saying
<EspyLacopa> A twinkie pinkie?
<Fluttershy> I know, but it's so... amazing o-o
<RD888> 0:O
<Fluttershy> Regardless
<Charlie_Horse> Indeed.
<roushguy> Jigglysaint, the therapeutic power of ponies both made me cry AND made me feel better.
<Rainbow_Dash> I know, I listen to it several times per day
<BlueJay> That's SO true, Jiggly.
<Rainbow_Dash> Lol
<Jigglysaint> yeah
<Fluttershy> Rainbow_Dash: >3> You are silly. -hugs-
<wolfinponysclothing> im bi polor and ponies work better than meds for me man i love them ponies
<Jigglysaint> yeah

<Jigglysaint> I am lucky no to actually suffer from depression
<EspyLacopa> Crasheriffic!
<BlueJay> Las week I was feeling rather blue, so I went and read some sadfics that got me crying my eyes out.
<RobotPinkie> I love ponies.
<Rainbow_Dash> =.=
<Jigglysaint> but at the same time, I do tend to lose track of what makes me special
<Awesomeshy> I noticed aspell in the help, this has spell check?
<roushguy> I get depressed a while back from reading Bittersweet and Pretty in Pink
<Fluttershy> -grins-
<roushguy> I was bawling my eyeballs out.
<Pontang> <Kabaka> I'm friends with the guys that do a really popular furry podcast. They're all bronies, and so are most of the listeners, and they all use IRC. I'll have them mention the network <--- where is the podcast at?
<BlueJay> I felt great afterwards. I just needed to let out some pressure.
<Pontang> :o
<WhatPayne> Rainbow Dash helped me find Offspring's You're Gonna Go Far, Kid
<^Stargazer> hihi everypony
<Charlie_Horse> Hi there.
<Jigglysaint> I want to share the ponies, but at the same time hide them from everybody so I can have a safe place for myself
<Howling_Griffon> rainbowdash helped me keep my wedding sunny
<Jigglysaint> like it's a secret
<roushguy> Then I turned around and read some other stories and watched a couple episodes and I felt immensely better.
<Kabaka> http://foxstuffers.com/
<RobotPinkie> yeah, I hadn't listened to Offspring in like... 10 years or something
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: It can, yes.
<FreezeFrame> They're nearly as old as I am
<Kabaka> Awesomeshy: I've got mine configured to highlight words I misspell in red in the input bar.
<Jigglysaint> and the community, from what I've seen sofar, is pretty good
<Fluttershy> Rainbow Dash makes it 20% cooler... >3>
*FreezeFrame was born in 1985, The Offspring formed in 1986

<Jigglysaint> and what people should take it for
<Nittany_Tiger> 5 inches in 3 days.

<Kabaka> I'll give something new a look and possibly a trial run if people tell me its a good replacement. But whatever suits my needs with the least hassle is what I use.

<roushguy> Sixteen years of being ridiculed in various ways for my Pinkie Pie-like behavior has made me very thick-skinned.

<WhatPayne> Hello Dermathil
<Jigglysaint> for that reason I suck very much at missionary work
<y66> | 33 333 | |
<MehPlusRawr> <FreezeFrame> I wouldn't mind a belief system that has some of the same ideals of bronies: "love and tolerate the shit out of people", "friendship is magic", etc.

<Nashy> Another thing about bronies I take issue with is this whole "we must convert everyone, ponies everywhere" that some people seem to follow.
<Natleyn> Hiya Dermathil.
<y66> | 333 3333 33 | |
<Jigglysaint> that would just be plain lunacy
<Nashy> That is not tolerant.

<wolfinponysclothing> im ok with people who dont like mlp fim but only aslong as there not a jerk about it
<MetalRainbowDash> Steven
<Jigglysaint> if people see that a particular system of beliefs had a positive impact on your life
<Nashy> If you can't accept that people just don't like the same things as you and you shouldn't try to force them, you are not tolerant. You are behaving like you are in a cult.
<Jigglysaint> they will perhaps want to know more
<Jigglysaint> if not to satisfy their curiosity
<Jigglysaint> to be honest I'd hate to have all my friends go to church with me
<Weeshy> >nick list on right isde
<Weeshy> >already as seconds on timestamp
<Nashy> Celestia's Witnesses, they go door to door and ask if people have considered accepting ponies as their personal savior.
<BlueJay> I don't like to push people into liking what I like, as much as I don't like it when people try to push me into their beliefs.
<Xiagu> hey, quick question
<SillyNilly> Hello
<Jigglysaint> Church of Pinkie Pie
<Xiagu> how many people here were converted because one of their friends told them to watch the show?
<BlueJay> Not me.
<Jigglysaint> All hail Lord Smooze!
<wolfinponysclothing> not me
<roushguy> I was converted by mylittlebrony.com
<Kabaka> :D Awesome
<Weeshy> over all this looks really nice
<FreezeFrame> Church of Derpy Hooves of Latter-Day Saints :P
<Jigglysaint> lol
<Nashy> Yes, memebase/mylittlebrony.
<Dermathil> why do you think I has a party hat nearby?
<Jigglysaint> good enough for me
<Weeshy> works p much the same way, though I couldn't get ssl to work
<^Stargazer> not me
<wolfinponysclothing> memebase got me
<Jigglysaint> Derpy-day Saints
<FreezeFrame> Watching it on a friend's computer got me.
<Xiagu> well, I was
<FreezeFrame> This was the same friend who introduced me to Legend of Koizumi
<^Stargazer> two posts came up on popular forums I frequent and I decided to look into the show myself
<EspyLacopa> Birthday?
<Jigglysaint> one day I just decided to look up the show and watch it
<Natleyn> Pinkie Pie?
<Jigglysaint> after seeing a thread on Spoony's forums
<roushguy> After seeing page after page of ponies
<BlueJay> I saw an iPhone app that said it was ment for 18+ males. I was curious and did some reading.
<Nashy> I haven't recommended it to anyone, because I don't know anyone I think would like it.
<roushguy> I decided to just jump in an try watching episode 1
<VioletVanilla> 6Natleyn? :33
<BlueJay> I read about the characters.
<Dermathil> espylacopa: gotcha
<roushguy> And stopped around episode 16
<BlueJay> Then I said: "I gotta see this".
<roushguy> Because I ran out of night-time.
<Jigglysaint> see, I already like kiddie shows anyway
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<Jigglysaint> so I figured that I would just like this show anyway
<Nashy> I only recommend things if it's something I think they will enjoy, based on what things they already like.
<Jigglysaint> turned ot I was right
<Kabaka> There's stuff in the FAQ about SSL
<VioletVanilla> 6Hallo Dermathil~
<BlueJay> I saw the firs 5 or 6 episodes on a row.
<Jigglysaint> yeah
<Dermathil> ohai VioletVanilla
<Jigglysaint> my girlfriend hates cartoons
<BlueJay> Then I has to go to sleep.
<Jigglysaint> I would never tell her about that
<Natleyn> o3o
<SillyNilly> I saw the show under my own behest. No person had to attempt to convince me.
*Xiagu cannot remember how pushy his friend was, and the logs are on a different computer :(
<Nashy> I don't recommend everything I happen to like.
<Jigglysaint> she caught me trying to buy a Pinkie Pie and scolded me for it
<Kabaka> Could be any number of things.
<Nittany_Tiger> <Robot%OPinkie>: if anyone wants to add me, my PSN name is RobotPika <- I'll add you when I get home.
<Jigglysaint> sure it was a G3 Pinkie Pie
<wolfinponysclothing> buy one anyway
<BlueJay> I remember the first time I went to buy a Pony toy for myself...
<Jigglysaint> but I only want FIM Pinkie Pie
<Nashy> That's when it's time for DEAL WITH IT and sunglasses.
<Jigglysaint> and besides, I really want Rarity

<BlueJay> I kept thinking about my niece. "I anyone asks this is for her". But it wasn't.
<Nashy> I'm buying this Pinkie Pie! DEAL WITH IT.
<Spyrorocks[Air]`> lol
<Spyrorocks[Air]`> no one cares...

<Xiagu> Jigglysaint, pretty sure you don't need a card for paypal
<^Stargazer> I have no credit card either
<Nashy> I rarely have cash...
<roushguy> Does anyone have a dimension-travelling machine that I can borrow?
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<roushguy> I need to bring Fluttershy to my house.
<Xiagu> roushguy, I have a bike
<^Stargazer> well, no real credit card
<BlueJay> Fluttershy is the only one I'm missing.
<Dermathil> and even though it had campaign for multiple races, that made it spread too thin
<TuxOtaku> you don't need a credit card for paypal
<Xiagu> roushguy, it can travel in around 3 dimensions
<Wrek> 05define artist
<TuxOtaku> just a bank account
<VioletVanilla> 6Everpony, Fluttershy is asking who here is an artist. o:
<TuxOtaku> transactions TAKE longer
<TuxOtaku> but it will still work
<^Stargazer> I use a debit card pretty much
<Jigglysaint> ah
<TuxOtaku> I've done that for years
<BlueJay> I have the other five right there on the table in front of me....
<Dermathil> while DoW2 vanilla had a 50 hour campaign or something like that
<Jigglysaint> same here
<Nittany_Tiger> So many people love that game, so I must be alone in hating it because it's too difficult to enjoy.
<Nashy> Well credit/debit card, whatever.
<VioletVanilla> 6DOTA!
<Jigglysaint> I should look into that
<MetalRainbowDash> HI SUMICA
<Nittany_Tiger> I'm sure people hate it out of fanboyism, though.
<TuxOtaku> I used to work for a web hosting company who paid me via paypal
<MetalRainbowDash> Sumica did you look at umm

<BlueJay> Too bad I study IT, I can't relate my subjects to ponies...
<ValtheJean> jesus
<ValtheJean> this kid just wont quit
<Natleyn> ;~;
<wolfinponysclothing> lol i know but still
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol I'm sorry but RvB is stale and boring
<Zephirdd> Fluttershy: I doubt anypony who watched Lucky Star and enojyed it won't like MLP
<Zephirdd> no, nothing wrong with it
<MetalRainbowDash> The action animated episodes are good.
<wolfinponysclothing> antimatter is what derpys made of
<BlueJay> I do have an electromagnetism course next year... How could I possibly ponify that?
<Fluttershy> Tons of people are like "OMG it's guys who like ponies! How ridiculous!" But in reality most people watch anime and they call bronies girly because it's 'ponies'. That's just ridiculous
<AllisZero> I loved Lucky Star.
<Dashite> I don't regularly watch RvB. Just the occasional episode where the reds and blues are getting the crap kicked out of them.
<TuxOtaku> wolfinponysclothing, no...derpy is made entirely out of strange quarks.
<TuxOtaku> :P
<MetalRainbowDash> Star Driver japanese stuff is ok
<Dashite> I would disagree with your assertion that "most" people watch anime.
<wolfinponysclothing> lol
<Leonon> My Little Pony: Magnets are Magic
<MetalRainbowDash> but I didn't enjoy the making out part in what we watched last night.
<TuxOtaku> yayphysicshumour!
<BlueJay> Steven Magnet?
<wolfinponysclothing> i like the sound of that
<Fluttershy> Well, lots of people watch anime nowadays I should say, in one form or another. o-o Or they know of it, at least.
<MetalRainbowDash> Anyone want to read my horrible fanfic?
<Fluttershy> We even have anime shows that are integrated into daily kids shows xP Pokemon was anime before anybody even realized it was anime
<prince-dari> [19:28] <MetalRainbowDash> Anyone want to read my horrible fanfic?
<Dashite> MetalRainbowDash, then turn off the stream when something you don't like comes on? I don't really care for the anime stuff either so I generally turn it off or mute it. Doesn't bother me and other people get to watch stuff they like.
<Fluttershy> Same with Digimon and Sonic
<Spectrum> Hey everypony.
<prince-dari> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Spectrum> What're we watching tonight?
<prince-dari> Just when you thought it couldn't get worse.
<Fluttershy> Tonight? As in... tonight tonight? xP
<Dashite> True Romance and Rocky Horror Picture Show
<Zephirdd> cool
<Zephirdd> =d
<Zephirdd> is True Romance good?
<ValtheJean> lol
<Zephirdd> I never heard of it
<Dashite> No idea.
<mib_5cnm12> its name is ironic, i think.
<Spectrum> same./
<Fluttershy> I've never seen or heard of it. o-o But the description on it looked intriguing
<Dashite> Something about someone stealing cocaine from their pimp and then running away to sell it before they get caught or something.
<VioletVanilla> 6This thing wrote a fanfic? D:
<BlueJay> Do ponies have electricity? I've seen ambiguous references in the show.
<ValtheJean> of course it did
<prince-dari> It has a really high IMDb rating.
<ValtheJean> fanfics are the epitome of laziness and shit
<prince-dari> Should be good.
<prince-dari> Well.
<BlueJay> They have light switches, but we never see a light bulb.
<Jay6> Twilight has that weird contraption
<prince-dari> Pretty high anyway.
<MetalRainbowDash> M-m-m-meow
<Jay6> was that using electricity?
<Leonon> they have power over magic and lightning
<VioletVanilla> 6what if it. . . is about Caramel? :c
<Iks> and they have indoor plumbing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm incredibly lazy today. Someone find me a high-res vector of Vinyl Scratch
<Kabaka> For the lazy: it links to a John Joseco drawing of Lyra. http://fav.me/d49b9sc
<ValtheJean> then that's even worse
<BlueJay> You mean the contraption from Feeling Pinkie Keen?
<roushguy> They've got to have some sort of magical electricity.
<ValtheJean> because then they will have soiled the good name of Caramel
<prince-dari> Yeah, I couldn't be bothered, so I just scoured the comments.
<ValtheJean> and I will murder them
<prince-dari> I knew someone would have posted what the QR code linked to.
<BlueJay> That sure looks electrical.
<HaysforPonies> Maybe they channel magic for energy...or have something for electricity.
<MetalRainbowDash> mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeow
<roushguy> Otherwise Twilight's scientific...um... thingy.... from Feeling Pinkie Keen wouldn't work. Nor would Pinkie's lamp from Party Of One.
<TuxOtaku> of course they have electricity
<MetalRainbowDash> I'm having lunch.
<Colgate> I hate it when ponies put QR codes and shit online
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<BeatleBrony> watup!
<prince-dari> So fan literature is bad.
<Charlie_Horse> Hello.
<MetalRainbowDash> Mmmm
<prince-dari> But fan art is good?
<Iks> also they have trains pulled by ponies... whats up with that
<BeatleBrony> Wat's goin on in this chat
<MetalRainbowDash> Ham sandwich
<TuxOtaku> [VLC-Audio]: Happy Up Here - Royksopp [19:01:28/19:02:43] @ 192 kb/s
<ValtheJean> pretty much
<Leonon> ponies and science and magic
<prince-dari> Seems pretty contradictory to me.
<TuxOtaku> Iks, cleaner than coal?
<BeatleBrony> Theny need the engine for the whistle
<ValtheJean> because fan art isn't by definition terrible
<Dashite> ValtheJean http://misterlolrus.deviantart.com/art/Vinyl-Scratch-Vector-DJ-P0n3-249110692 ?
<BeatleBrony> They*
<BlueJay> We do see lights, but there's still a reasonable doubt obout their origins...
<prince-dari> How so?
<TuxOtaku> BlueJay, and what about Vinyl Scratch?
<BeatleBrony> And technology in Twilight's basement
<ValtheJean> 2,14 awesome, thank you Dashite
<Iks> ah the whistle of course
<BeatleBrony> It's all explained in fallout equestira
<ValtheJean> because when you take the works of someone else for your own literature, you're just half-assing the writing
<TuxOtaku> you kinda need power and technology to work a set of turntables
<BeatleBrony> the whistle
<Dashite> First thing that came up on Youtube.
<Dashite> Er Google.
<wolfinponysclothing> true how whould vinyls stuff work without it
<Dashite> Not youtube.
<BlueJay> She could turn the tables by magic, I think... After all she IS a unicorn.
<ValtheJean> it's intellectually stagnant
<BeatleBrony> MAGITECH
<LvS> maybe everything works on magical batteries
<roushguy> Explain Pinkie's lamp, then :P
<ValtheJean> strange...all the google results I got were low rez
<ValtheJean> oh well

<TuxOtaku> I look at it the same way Thor explains Asgard in the comics.
<Leonon> it's Pinkie Pie, we don't have to explain it
<BlueJay> Fireflies?
<prince-dari> And the same is true for art.
<BeatleBrony> Instead of electricity runing through circuit boards, it's magic through gems
<Iks> that was probably a pot with a plant before... we know she produces her own inprobability field
<TuxOtaku> Asgard is a place with technology so advanced that it could be misconstrued as magic
<prince-dari> You're just using someone else's work.
<TuxOtaku> BeatleBrony, yeah like that
<Dashite> I just searched for "Vinyl Scratch vector" First 4 or so results were deviant art links with at least 4000x4000 resolutions.
<BeatleBrony> +1 point for BeatleBrony
<ValtheJean> I judge fanart by the same rules I judge fanfics
<BeatleBrony> Doctor Whooves fic
<BlueJay> Oh, but Pinkie also used a turntable at the gala...
<BeatleBrony> explains it alot
<Natleyn> Time to go!
<Natleyn> Bye peoples~
<Dashite> Later
<BlueJay> But then again... that's Pinkie.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> Nope.
<TuxOtaku> and Iks +1 geek point for referencing hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
<ValtheJean> a fanfic is the art equivalent of making a comic entirely out of vectored images with no drawing applied
<TuxOtaku> [VLC-Audio]: Young Blood - The Naked And Famous [19:01:54/19:04:06] @ 128 kb/s
<prince-dari> Or you would hate most fan art too.
<ValtheJean> and those same comics I despise
<Iks> i did that like 5 times already
<TuxOtaku> this song is freaking awesome, btw.
<prince-dari> No it isn't Val.
<ValtheJean> I hate a_lot of fanart
<VioletVanilla> 6It makes me want to say yes to his interview.
<TuxOtaku> Iks, yeah but I just noticed that last one...lol
<VioletVanilla> 6JUST so we could post it under the BEST INTERVIEW EVER thread. . .
<prince-dari> XD
<Wrek> 05now i take offence
<Wrek> 05:C
<Mushroom> Hello, everypony! :)
<Lemon_Lime> How's everyone? o 3o
<BeatleBrony> yo!
<Charlie_Horse> Hi there.
<ValtheJean> do you make comics filled with only vectored images from the show?
<prince-dari> They aren't equivalent Val.
<Wrek> 05no i make comics filled with vectors that ive drawn based of canon content
*Lemon_Lime waves to a hoof to everypony.
<ValtheJean> well that isn't what I said I hate :P
<MetalRainbowDash> Bai
<prince-dari> They would be if you only took lines and plot from episodes of MLP and arranged it into a story.
<Wrek> 05close enough to hurt me feelin's
<prince-dari> Then they would be equivalent.
*MetalRainbowDash hugs everypony
<MetalRainbowDash> brb
<ValtheJean> even if you are right on that one point dari, the fact remains that there is not a single fanfic that is quality literature
<BeatleBrony> Alright, random poll
<Charlie_Horse> A poll you say
<BeatleBrony> Well more like question
<Wrek> 05define the definition of quality litterature
<BlueJay> Ask away.
<BeatleBrony> What is the last fanfic you have read?
<roushguy> Go on, friend.
<ValtheJean> I'll give you two, either of which you may take
<roushguy> I'm reading one right now
<Xiagu> the last one....?
<ValtheJean> 1) Something I would enjoy reading
<Leonon> Cross and arrow
<BeatleBrony> The most recent one
<Xiagu> Pizza
<roushguy> Hayseed.
<Xiagu> nowait Cross and Arrow
<Charlie_Horse> Oh, man...uh...do the Full Life Consequences fics count?
<ValtheJean> 2) Something that (had it not been a fanfic) could be published
<Mushroom> Exactly one week until Season 2. :3
<^Stargazer> I've only read one lol
<roushguy> I don't remember its name
<^Stargazer> Hoenshy
<BlueJay> Right now I'm on the middle of "The party Hasn't Ended".
<roushguy> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:18h:22m:52s
<roushguy> !s3
<DerpyBot> I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
<Xiagu> !s4
<Nashy> I don't keep track of that...
<Iks> last fanfic... something winds burning hearts
<Xiagu> !s1
<^Stargazer> !movie
<Zanzibar> Last fanfic read: The Light in the Darkness
<Xiagu> Iks, frigid
<Zanzibar> It was average.-
<NewDCD> 9okay so
<Iks> yes
<prince-dari> I'm pretty sure there's a LOT of 2 around.
<NewDCD> 9seems Veemi's servers are having trouble
<prince-dari> Since there's a lot of crappy published books.
<ValtheJean> prove it
<Mushroom> I'm starting to read the Fallout EQ series.
<Dashite> :(
<^Stargazer> friendship is magic... the movie
<NewDCD> 9so we switched the Dinkypage to uStream Emergency Broadcast System for tonight
<^Stargazer> woohoo lol
<ValtheJean> I'm not talking about self-published books
<NewDCD> 9if your refresh it, you should see it
<NewDCD> 9movie night will be streamed through there at the same quality
<ValtheJean> I'm talking about books that actually have to go through a PUBLISHER
<Zephirdd> why is that? :O
<NewDCD> 9Veemi is having trouble
<NewDCD> 9as in
<Dashite> Veemi servers are derping.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because the people at Veemi are evil
<NewDCD> 9our stream provider
<NewDCD> 9is dying
<BlueJay> Sorry, guys, but I have to get going now.
<BeatleBrony> Fallout EQ is epic
<BeatleBrony> c ya blue jay
<BlueJay> Actually, I have to go like 5 minutes ago...
<Mushroom> I'm liking it a lot so far
<^Stargazer> later
<Wrek> 051/2, bueno
<Zephirdd> :O
<Zephirdd> :/
<BlueJay> It was nice talking to you all.
<BlueJay> Have a nice day.
<Iks> it is? i dont know if i wanna read it... i liked the fallout games although i never played fallout 3
<Mushroom> By the way, I created my pony name: Mushroom Cloud. Is that taken?
<Iks> but cant seem to get myself to read it
<prince-dari> There's lot of crappy books published by publishers.
<prince-dari> lots*
<ValtheJean> such as?
<BeatleBrony> Well, there are alot of fallout 3 refrences
<mexican> sup
<Turgle> T_T
<mexican> im here
<Turgle> saturday 17
<Turgle> im gonna work
<wolfinponysclothing> well buy bronys gunna go watch some ponies
<Turgle> T_T
<wolfinponysclothing> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, wolfinponysclothing!
<Charlie_Horse> Okey-doke.
<ValtheJean> I'd be willing to argue the books you're talking about are just not enjoyable to you, yet are still very well written
<Zephirdd> I'm so sorry Turgle :\
<mexican> !plot
<DerpyBot> *wigglewiggle*
<Zanzibar> Took me a while to read Fallout: EQ as well. It just never seemed like a mix that would Work. But dang, it does. It's an amazing fanfic.
<Zephirdd> you can still catch it on youtube tho :D
<Turgle> yeah me too T_T
<Mushroom> I've played Fallout New Vegas, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
<Turgle> yes BUT
<BeatleBrony> Kkat does an excellent job
<Turgle> #bronystate won't be there
<BeatleBrony> I preffer Fallout 3 but that's kool
<Turgle> T_T
<Zephirdd> We're always here bro
<Zephirdd> :D
<Kabaka> Time for sleep. Night, ponies.
<roushguy> I just remembered when Pinkie got the full doozy combo
<Turgle> :')
<Dashite> What hours are you working?
<roushguy> And briefly turned into a blimp
<Iks> i wish they would make more isometric games..
<Zanzibar> And as for the references, I can't spot them. Most of the time. Despite having finnished both Fallout 3 and New Vegas. They are spun in a definitely Pony way. Gives them a life of their own.
<Spectrum> it's gonna be on http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
<VioletVanilla> 6Goodnight Kabaka~
<Turgle> from 7 am to 1 am of sunday
<Spectrum> SEASON 2 WILL BE AIRING ON SYNCHTUBE
<Dashite> O.o
<ValtheJean> 2,14 false
<Zephirdd> and on bronystate
<Mushroom> :)
<Zephirdd> -_-
<Dashite> That's a long freakin' shift.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 synchtube will merely provide a recorded video
<Turgle> yep
<Wrek> 05in other words, pointless discussion
<Wrek> 05it comes down to personal preference
<Turgle> im a light technician at theaters
<Dashite> 18 hours shift? What are you doing?
<Spectrum> Ah.
<Dashite> Ah
<Turgle> heh
<BeatleBrony> The great thing about FO:E is that while it starts as a crossover fic, it really grows into so much more
<Dashite> Still a damn long shift.
<ValtheJean> I can abide by that consensus, as much as I am inclined to disagree with it :"P
<BeatleBrony> It becomes more of a character study
<ValtheJean> :P*
<Dashite> Got a smart phone?
<Turgle> nope T_T
<Dashite> Damn.
<BeatleBrony> What would happen if the mane 6 were thrust into leadership positions during a war?
<Turgle> i hope i can get a break of 20 minutes
<Turgle> and watch the episode with you all
<BeatleBrony> "The road to hell is paved with good intentions"
<BeatleBrony> Some of those memory orbs and recordings really punch you in the gut
<BeatleBrony> in a good way
<Mushroom> Rarity would be apart of the white glove society, that's for sure. :)
<Iks> kinda like the white shoe boys?
<Zanzibar> Heck yes. It's easy to think of the Mane 6 to be a bit OOC at first. When you've just received a glimps or two of them. But the more you read, the more it all makes sense.
<BeatleBrony> Yes^
<Iks> like gerald celente calls em... Harvard, Princeton, Yale. Bullets, Bombs and Banks.
<BeatleBrony> And the OCs are incredibly well done too
<Wrek> 05now
<Wrek> 05back to drawing rainbow dash
<BeatleBrony> Littlepip is currently my favorite OC
<BeatleBrony> closely followed by Nyx
<BeatleBrony> then Steelhooves
<BeatleBrony> then the rest of the fallout equestira charactres
<Mushroom> I haven't gotten that far into it yet, still in chapter 1
<BeatleBrony> ah
<BeatleBrony> kewl
<BeatleBrony> keep going
<Mushroom> just started 30 mins ago
<BeatleBrony> it gets epic!
<Mushroom> haha but i will. :D

<Leonon> I have
<prince-dari> Yay.
<prince-dari> Best pony.
<BeatleBrony> You a lover or a hater?
<Iks> i liked it
<BeatleBrony> Because there doesn't seem to be much of a spectrum
<BeatleBrony> kewl
<LunaOnTheMoon> Great story
<Mushroom> What a story, Mark!
<Wrek> 05streamign it aswell
<Wrek> 05becasue im bored
<BeatleBrony> PenStroke did an excellent job with the end
<BeatleBrony> I felt that I could never be satisfied with the end, but he managed to pull it out and make it work
<prince-dari> So what are you saying Val, even if an author who had books out which weren't self-published wrote a fanfic, it'd still be bad?
<LunaOnTheMoon> I think Celestia was a touch out of character
<LunaOnTheMoon> But that's probably my biggest gripe
<BeatleBrony> I have yet to read the revisions so I can't say anymore
<Iks> well she was more out of character in the first version
<BeatleBrony> on my initial readthrough, I didn't think it was too bad
<BeatleBrony> I could feel she had regret
<LunaOnTheMoon> More along the lines of, I can't really see her doing what she did
<BeatleBrony> but this was also the pony who banished her "sister" to the moon
<BeatleBrony> sister should be italics
<LunaOnTheMoon> word of note:she banished her permanently
<BeatleBrony> to emphasise
<BeatleBrony> exactly
<LunaOnTheMoon> so NMM's return was a happy event
<LunaOnTheMoon> "happy"
<Rainbow_Dash> ..What?
<ValtheJean> one flaw with your argument
<LunaOnTheMoon> and basically, Celestia was without someone who understood her for 1k years
<ValtheJean> a published author would never write a fanfic :P
<LunaOnTheMoon> Celestia is sad pony :(
<BeatleBrony> yes
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> Wrong.
<ValtheJean> but hey, I'll be reasonable
<prince-dari> I've seen fanfics by published authors before.
<prince-dari> So I KNOW you're wrong there.

<Rainbow_Dash> Wow, Steven was pretty late

<LunaOnTheMoon> :(
<BeatleBrony> I wish I was in a sadfic mood when I read that
<prince-dari> But the author got published, which is why they stopped writing fanfics.
<Charlie_Horse> Oh dear.
<LunaOnTheMoon> I was i n a sadfic mood
<BeatleBrony> I only cry when I'm in a sadfic mood
<LunaOnTheMoon> I practically shed tears
<ValtheJean> >which is why they stopped writing fanfics
<Nittany_Tiger> I wonder how many PC players EA is scaring off with Origin?
<BeatleBrony> I had tears welling and a wasn't in a sadfic mood
<BeatleBrony> thats how powerful it was
<ValtheJean> but hey, I'll be reasonable here
<prince-dari> It was because they no longer had the free time to devote to it.
<ValtheJean> show me a fanfic that's good
<Iks> i allowed myself to shed a few tears
<ValtheJean> and I'll take everything back
<ValtheJean> and hah, that's such bullshit it makes me want to laugh

<Nittany_Tiger> Yep, and they're trying to become more evil than Activision.

<Zephirdd> lol
<BeatleBrony> The most recent chapter of FO:E had an excellent scene thatwould have had me bawling
<BeatleBrony> but I just wasn't in the mood for it
<Nittany_Tiger> They were the most evil publisher until Kotick started opening his mouth.
<BlacklightShining> are we in a net split?

<prince-dari> You don't WANT to like them in the first place.

<Nittany_Tiger> Now it's a full-on war on mistreating loyal consumers.
<ValtheJean> that's actually completely bullshit
<prince-dari> Also, I don't know any fanfics.

<VioletVanilla> 6I played the Alpha though. . .
<Xiagu> !hug
<DerpyBot> Hugtiem? :3
<Xiagu> no
<Wrek> 05yeh
*DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around Xiagu in a tight embrace
<Xiagu> raaaaape :(
<VioletVanilla> 6It was outrageous and fantastic. Even with Origin. :b
<prince-dari> Wow.
<^Stargazer> lol
<Nittany_Tiger> EA can't be trusted. They like to play parent with their games.
<Wrek> 05been doign that will all the banners
<RobotPinkie> yeah, Steam exists, so Origin would be completely superfluous even if it wasn't malware
<Dashite> I've got a couple friends that were in the alpha. I owe them some payback when the game finally comes out.
<prince-dari> I don't get how people manage to use a mouse and still make it look good. XD
<VioletVanilla> 6^ This.
<Nittany_Tiger> Origin is good for competition, but it's from a company that isn't popular with fans for good reasons.
<ValtheJean> practice :P
<prince-dari> Or innate skill. :P
<Spin> Hey JackiePie!
<JackiePie> Hi
<RobotPinkie> I don't think it's for competition, really...
<MetalRainbowDash> Ooh steam
<LvS> hi
<MetalRainbowDash> I have it
<ValtheJean> well innate skill is always a factor in these things
<Thunder_Dash> I mean, one of the arguments I've seen for Origin is "Steam started out not-too-great as well, so it's not any different"
<ValtheJean> it doesn't change the fact that you can do reasonably well with practice
<VioletVanilla> 6Wrek what music is this? I recognize it so much. . . Final Fantasy?
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: My Little Investigations - Engine Demo - Locations (http://tinyurl.com/3q8vr48)
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't like Steam at first, and I'm still not a fan of digital distribution, but I've never had a problem with it.
<RobotPinkie> difference is that EA wants to add more layers of DRM... that's my big problem with it, essentially
<Nittany_Tiger> But Valve has never been cruel to it's customers.
<Dashite> Honestly, even with everything Origin has going against it, as long as I don't get "Sorry, but your game is unavailable. Please try again later." messages all the time then I'll get along just fine with it.
<VioletVanilla> 6I see my chat in your screen! X3
<Wrek> 05"when your cutie marks not there~"
<Wrek> 05"we're the cuite mark crusaders, on a quest to find out who we are~"
<Turgle> gtg
<Turgle> bye everypony
<Turgle> :D
<Dashite> Later Turgle
<ValtheJean> I like to think that Twilight would be a fan of Final Fantasy
<RobotPinkie> bai Turgle
<MetalRainbowDash> Aaahahaha
<RandomExtra> Dat skype
<MetalRainbowDash> Bai Turgle
<Thunder_Dash> bye, Turgle
<RandomExtra> Bye Turgle
<Thunder_Dash> Oh I thought that was my Skype XD
<Turgle> bye :3
<VioletVanilla> 6What in the name of all that is Sugarcube Corner. . . o^o
<RobotPinkie> oh, stream's going?
<Nittany_Tiger> EA banned two players from DA 2 from what they said on forums. What's to stop them from banning you from playing every game you own on Origin because you badmouthed someone or the publisher?
<VioletVanilla> 6You are hacking the picture D:
<Wrek> 05?
<Fluttershy> back!
<RobotPinkie> nothing, because you don't own a copy of an EA game after you buy it :P
<VioletVanilla> 6You are too good, how do I quit you?!
<NewDCD> oh wow
<NewDCD> uStream doesn't allow for rezising
<NewDCD> how faggy
<prince-dari> Can you do realistic, Wrek?
<Dashite> Honestly, I wouldn't mind if they banned a few more people from the DA2 forums. Maybe some from the Mass Effect forums as well. >_>
*Wrek signle handedly made violet addicted
<Thunder_Dash> I'd be more okay with Origin if it weren't for the fact that EA hasn't given me much reason to trust them - The only real reason I stick with Steam is because apart from having some trouble with Valve's support, the only thing they've done that's really irritated me is L4D2's bugfixes
<Wrek> 05and i can do fairly realistic
<Wrek> 05jsut not in vector
<Nittany_Tiger> The DA2 bans were for the games.
<prince-dari> Some of the realism artists just blow me away.
<Chromadancer> Seth fails at typing bronychat, it seems
<prince-dari> My head just explodes.
<Dashite> I am aware of this.
<Wrek> 05indeed
<Wrek> 05latest pinkamena for an examble
<Wrek> 05p*
<Iks> damn i never realized how bad seaquest was... at least season 2
<Nittany_Tiger> EA isn't their parent, so they have no right to take their games away for their attitude.
<prince-dari> There's a guy on youtube who puts up the clips of him drawing stuff start to finish.
<prince-dari> And the end product looks so much like a photograph.
<prince-dari> I look at the blank white page he starts with.
<Wrek> 05those guys are isnane
<prince-dari> And my head just fucking explodes.
<ValtheJean> it's even crazier when they hand paint it
<Nittany_Tiger> It's bad when a company that sells you games can prevent you from playing them for your opinion.
<JackiePie> I only watched one episode of it, and that's because I had a crush on Jonathan Brandis.
<RobotPinkie> I think technically they may have that right, since you're only buying a temporary license to play the game.
<LvS> well, it's often like that
<LvS> i recently played tales of symphonia with a friend
<Nittany_Tiger> They don't have the right.
<LvS> six years ago, i loved that game
<EspyLacopa> Huh. Chantelise.
<LvS> now i think it's one of the dumbest things ever
<MrPoniator> How come?
<RobotPinkie> They shouldn't have that right, but that's another thing
<LvS> mostly because of the characters
<Thunder_Dash> Even if they do/did have the right to do that, suspending someone for stating an opinion doesn't look good.
<Nittany_Tiger> If I bought something from a grocery store, and then cussed out the manager, do they have the right to take away what I bought?
<MrPoniator> Yeah, pretty stereotypical JRPG characters
<Nittany_Tiger> But suspend them from playing their game?
<Nittany_Tiger> That's not right.
<LvS> also, the whole situation itself
<Nittany_Tiger> A forum suspension, yes.
<Nittany_Tiger> Game suspension, hell no.
<LvS> basically, the world is ending
<RobotPinkie> well you're not buying a license to eat a tomato :P
<Charlie_Horse> Indeed.
<VioletVanilla> 6I need to find that picture, a brushed Rainbow Dash in the clouds
<LvS> and nobody really even seems to care.
<prince-dari> Ah, I found the one I'm thinking of in this particular situation.
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, I meant the game suspension.
<prince-dari> The video.
<prince-dari> It is as fucking insane as I remember it.
<MrPoniator> Because not everyone knows about it
<prince-dari> That end product is a photo, I SWEAR IT!
<LvS> they're like "Oh well. Time for some unfunny jokes!"
<Nittany_Tiger> Apple won't close my iTunes account if I send them an angry letter.
<LvS> yes, well, but they DO know about those stupid farms, which are basically concentration camps
<MrPoniator> there are more heavy hearted JRPGs if you're looking for one
<prince-dari> MFW that only took 5.5 hours.
<prince-dari> Holy shit.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or stop me from listening my music.
<prince-dari> This is just insane.
<Nittany_Tiger> The modern AAA gaming industry is crap.
<LvS> i know; i didn't mean to imply there weren't any
<Nittany_Tiger> You don't own anything anymore.
<MrPoniator> Generally Tales of series isn't that special
<RobotPinkie> Well, that's the problem with software copyright laws.
<MrPoniator> Except for their fun battle system
<EspyLacopa> Wow, I forgot I had Portal on my steam account. . .*installs*
<CarrotTop> seth never posts anything important that I mail him
<VioletVanilla> 6. . . This song. . . . 3:
<Nittany_Tiger> And the seller can tell you when you can and can't play the game for /any/ reason.
<Wrek> 05its the hair dari
<Wrek> 05the hair fools you
<prince-dari> How the fuck does he do the hair?
<prince-dari> O____________o
<CarrotTop> like this
<CarrotTop> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josw4pxJcsc
<prince-dari> It's...
<prince-dari> IMPOSSIBRU!
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah, but the way EA and Ubisoft go about protecting their copyrights, they instigate piracy.
<RobotPinkie> I agree that it sucks, and it shouldn't be legal
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Wrek> 05also
<Wrek> 05few things feels as weird as when you pull a sock on a sleepign foot
<Michael89pl> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Nittany_Tiger> I think there should be legislation against draconian DRM.
<Rainbow_Dash> Welcome back Fluttershy.. These brutes seem to have forgotten about you =o
<RobotPinkie> Legitimate customers are punished, and pirates rewarded... kinda funny, really
<Wrek> 05put'
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Michael89pl> yes
<Nittany_Tiger> Also used game buyers are being punished now.
*VioletVanilla explodes.
<Thorinair> whats that Oo
<prince-dari> What the hell.
<prince-dari> Even the single strands of hair look like they're from a photo.
<MrPoniator> But oh well
<prince-dari> How does he do it? O__o
<RobotPinkie> That's also one thing that really pisses me off
<Thunder_Dash> re: Capcom's splendid </sarc> save method for... that Resident Evil game on 3DS?\
<Wrek> 05a paintbrush
<MrPoniator> Can't help that tales of symphonia is one of the only JRPGs on GC, LvS
<AllisZero> 0This is going to be a very painful two hours...
<Dashite> Stuff like the capcom thing really pisses me off. One time use codes for new copies not so much.
<LvS> yeah, well, doesn't really matter nowadays.
<VioletVanilla> 6I'd like to make myself believe Equestria's, kind, puuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhnnnneeeeeee~~~
<prince-dari> YFW the cat in the suggested videos for this video is NOT a picture.
<MrPoniator> True
<prince-dari> That cat.
<prince-dari> Seriously.
<MrPoniator> I gotta play Baiten Kaitos someday
<RobotPinkie> how so, AllisZero?
<LvS> NO
<prince-dari> I thought it was a photo until I remembered seeing him draw it.
<Thunder_Dash> To be honest, Capcom hasn't really been making good decisions recently anyways
<LvS> Don't ever play that
<prince-dari> God damn,.
<VioletVanilla> 6MFW THIS SONG ON AFTER THE SOFT ONE
<LvS> it's AWFUL.
<Nittany_Tiger> Things EA, Activision, and Ubisoft piss me off enough that I don't buy from them at all.
<MrPoniator> How come?
<Wrek> 05fittign wallpaper aswell
<VioletVanilla> 6x.x You blew my ears out Wrek ;A;
<roushguy> While we're on the topic of odd-sounding games
<LvS> well, the story is stupid
<Nittany_Tiger> I though Ubisoft had changed by removing their PC always-on DRM, but then they decided to bring it back.
<roushguy> Anypony in here played Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation?
<LvS> and then there's this big gimmick of every single person having wings and being able to fly
<Nittany_Tiger> Then they lie to PC customers with "From Dust."
<LvS> but they NEVER do that when it'd be useful
<VioletVanilla> 6but your art is beautiful. . . <33
<Thunder_Dash> They did? How so?
<RobotPinkie> one reason I prefer consoles, really
<Charlie_Horse> !moon
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Charlie_Horse!
<prince-dari> Are you fucking shitting me?
<Wrek> 05ok time for fucking epic
<prince-dari> The cat was only TWO HOURS.
<MrPoniator> And these are only story-related issues?
<^Stargazer> tales of symphonia was fun
<prince-dari> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<Nittany_Tiger> They lied about the DRM on "From Dust."
<LvS> well, mostly
<RobotPinkie> I mean I know there are some XBLA and PSN titles with shitty DRM, but if you buy a disc you buy a disc, and that's that.
<^Stargazer> I never beat it though, I can never beat most single player rpg's =/
<Dashite> GGgala, really man? How many do you need?!
<prince-dari> I refuse to accept that that is drawn.
<LvS> the rest was okay, i suppose, but the story and the characters are just so stupid that it made me pretty mad
<prince-dari> It's not possible.
<prince-dari> God dammit.
<ValtheJean> lol, u mad dari?
<MrPoniator> I doubt it sinks to the level of Tales of Eternia
<Fluttershy> hey everypony I'm really sorry but I need to go yet again, but I will be back on in about an one and a half hours to two hours
<roushguy> http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/#/d49b9sc
<prince-dari> More like astounded.
<roushguy> Um
<roushguy> Hmm
<Dashite> Bye Fluttershy
<roushguy> Don't click that
<^Stargazer> ...
<prince-dari> This is just amazing.
<roushguy> That's not what I thought I had ready for copypasta
<Wrek> 05dari had a fanboi-gasm
<Tiles> Night everypony
<roushguy> the hay
<RobotPinkie> later Fluttershy
<MrPoniator> Just a pic of Lyra
<Tiles> huthut I barely participated in the conversation and I'm saying good night
<Tiles> hurhur
<roushguy> It's a QR code link I looked at earlier
<Thunder_Dash> See ya, Fluttershy
<prince-dari> Sorry, photo-realistic art always gets me.
<prince-dari> XD
<MrPoniator> Could've been worse considering you linked something from Johnjoseco
<LvS> what you might want to play is Wizardry 8
<RobotPinkie> Anyone know a good torrent with pony musics?
<AllisZero> 0I'm feeling really crappy RobotPinkie
<LvS> now that's a great rpg.
<roushguy> I was TRYING to link a specific point from episode 16
<LvS> look at my party:
<LvS> http://i56.tinypic.com/1ppk.jpg
<Fluttershy> soooo yup. ^^ Be back later! Also doing streamception today or so that's the plan I believe... bye!
<AllisZero> 0But I took the day off yesterday, don't want to go home early again today
<Dashite> There we go.
<Wrek> 05enjoy some pink floyd
<RobotPinkie> I only have like 20 pony songs on my PS3 atm :(
<roushguy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20qW-w1fJFw&feature=player_detailpage#t=31s
<roushguy> MUCH better
<RobotPinkie> ouch, sorry to hear that AllisZero
<VioletVanilla> 6See you soon Fluttershy! :3
<FluffyWuffs> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:17h:43m:08s
<Wrek> 05and rainbowdash
<MrPoniator> Oh boy, that ponyfan fellow
<FluffyWuffs> /)^3^(\
<prince-dari> I could post a screenshot of the finished product of this cat in the chat, say it was my cat and people would believe me.
<FluffyWuffs> o hai poniator
<FluffyWuffs> any new anim's :D
<FluffyWuffs> ?
<Wrek> 05prove_it_twilight.jpg
<prince-dari> Ok.l
<MrPoniator> Haven't worked on any for a couple of days because of being sick
<FluffyWuffs> :c
<FluffyWuffs> I'm catching a cold myself
<AllisZero> 0It happens
<MrPoniator> Puch
<MrPoniator> Ouch*
<FluffyWuffs> I'm eating tons of halls candy
<FluffyWuffs> kinda reduces the sore
<FluffyWuffs> XD
<MrPoniator> And LvS, just as a quick drop on the Baiten Kaitos matter, it's just that I've a friend who generally likes the same type of JRPGs as me, so he suggested Baiten Kaitos to me
<Nittany_Tiger> I was late at school yesterday coding.
<Sumica> So is it bad after seeing Trixie in french I wonder what they will do For Madam Le Flour in party of one.
<Nittany_Tiger> Also Wednesday.
<LvS> well, okay, that depends, i guess
<LvS> probably just wasn't for me
<MrPoniator> Sure, story might be silly, but as long it's engagin enough so that I can keep playing, it's fine
<MrPoniator> Though, in some instances as Tales of Eternia I really forced myself to finish the game, just for the sake of finishing the game
<Ponyfan> hei mrponinator
<MrPoniator> Not once before has a game been as annoying with its characters as that one
<MrPoniator> For me, at least
<Ponyfan> mrponinator
<MrPoniator> Yeah?
<LvS> i felt that way about Mana Khemia
<Ponyfan> se oon mä
<MrPoniator> I know, Ponyfan
<LvS> i hate that game with a vengeance, but i had to finish it
<Ponyfan> ok ok
<LvS> all the time i was like, "Well, this can't possibly get any dumber"
<MrPoniator> Funnily enough I know a fellow who liked Mana Khemia, though, admits the game has its flaws
<LvS> but it did. so i HAD to keep playing, just to see HOW stupid it would eventually get.
<MrPoniator> Also, no matter how much people seem to like Persona 4, I don't find it that special
<LvS> i wrote pretty much an essay of what's wrong with that game, about 8000 words long
<MrPoniator> I'd rather play it as a simdate game instead of being a JRPG with rather boring combat and dull dungeons
<roushguy> I miss the good ol' days of JRPGs
<LvS> i've never played persona...
<roushguy> Like Final Fantasy 7-9
<Wrek> 05will that suffice as a dashie banner?
<roushguy> And Legend of Dragoon
<MrPoniator> Golden Sun: The Lost Age is my favorite JRPG
<roushguy> YES
<roushguy> YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
<Zanzibar> I for one do not miss those.
<prince-dari> Looks good.
<MrPoniator> Not really that special plot, but the gameplay is pretty darn great
<roushguy> A million times over yes
<MrPoniator> The best dungeons in any JRPG, period
*roushguy bounces around like Twilight Sparkle squeakscreaming 'yes'
<LvS> in my opinion, the jrpg with the best story ever is Suikoden 2
<Wrek> 05here goes then
<Zanzibar> JRPGs were good when I was young and had the patience to play the same dang battle a million times over.
<roushguy> *drool*
<Zanzibar> But now? Man, that's a repetitive way to do a game xD
<roushguy> You know that the best True Rune of all is the Souleater
<MrPoniator> Golden Sun is pretty good in terms that the combat is fast, but I guess that's given for a handheld title
<roushguy> My god, I loved Suikoden.
<MrPoniator> Final Fantasy IX, oh god the load times and slowness
<roushguy> Suikoden 2 was just icing on the cake
<MrPoniator> Great game, but replaying it years later reminded me how annoying the random battles can be
<roushguy> Suikoden 3 I've never played, Suikoden 4 was okay, and I've not played 5 either
<MrPoniator> I'm yet to play a Suidoken title
<roushguy> Who's your favorite Star Of Destiny?
<LvS> Luc... I think.
<roushguy> ......
<roushguy> Luc?
<LvS> even though he's the bad guy in 3
<roushguy> .......
<roushguy> Luc?
<LvS> why not?
<MrPoniator> But in terms of story in JRPGs, I'd say that something like Valkyrie Profile is there
<roushguy> Ugh
<roushguy> Valkyrie Profile
<roushguy> That was an interesting game
<MrPoniator> Surely
<roushguy> Especially Silmeria
<roushguy> but my favorite Stars are
<roushguy> 1: Pahn
<roushguy> 2: Viktor
<MrPoniator> The DS Valkyrie Profile title wasn't that bad either
<MrPoniator> Pretty fun strategy game
<roushguy> Lenneth?
<roushguy> I heard mixed things about it.
<MrPoniator> VP: Lenneth is a port of the PS1 VP to PSP
<LvS> lenneth is terrible
<LvS> and it's the only one i played
<MrPoniator> the DS strategy game is Covenant of the Plume
<roushguy> Silmeria is amazing.
<LvS> my brother kept telling me the others are way better, and he's probably right
<prince-dari> Hey.
<prince-dari> Have I shown you guys my cat before?
<LvS> but lenneth was just so bad, i really don't want to try any of the others.
<MrPoniator> What was so bad about Lenneth?
<roushguy> Give Silmeria a try.
<Dashite> Not that I am aware of.
<roushguy> Or Star Ocean
<Thunder_Dash> I don't think so...
<roushguy> Star Ocean Till the End Of Time
<roushguy> That was an amazing game
<roushguy> Even though I never beat it
<MrPoniator> Though, I do admit that it can be kinda weird
<prince-dari> Ooh.
<prince-dari> I'll upload a picture.
<MrPoniator> Or pretty darn unconventional
<MetalRainbowDash> bbbbbbb
<MetalRainbowDash> Super broed
<LvS> lenneth was confusing, and that whole episodic thing made it pretty much impossible to explore freely
<prince-dari> Meh.
<LvS> since you were always on a timer
<Nittany_Tiger> I also have a cat pic if you want to see it.
<LvS> and WHY
<Nittany_Tiger> Of my cat.
<prince-dari> The only few I have on my computer are pretty small.
<LvS> are there SAMURAIS

<Thunder_Dash> The stream isn't up on either page for me...
<Stomper> also really prince-dari?
<Solarstorm> !moon
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<DerpyBot> Grab my tail, Solarstorm!
<MrPoniator> Suppose he didn't bother to get a cracked version
<prince-dari> I was wondering why it was bronychan.
<RobotPinkie> yeah, offline for me
<Stomper> lol ya
<banannagram> saw that in a comment
<LvS> aye
<Stomper> but its cool though, we caught it pretty fast
<roushguy> Boktai was fun
<Cat> what was that even a drawing of?
<Cat> I have no idea
<roushguy> Until I wound up with sun poisoning from it
<Cat> what a fool
<roushguy> I could nod and watch my forehead wobble
<Wrek> 05what gives it away is the enviroment
<Nittany_Tiger> http://imageshack.us/f/147/img4714hy7.jpg/ <- My cat (has no white whiskers now).
<Wrek> 05definetly looks painted
<roushguy> aawwwwwwwww
<InsertCupcake> i get a stream on dinky but not on co.cc
<roushguy> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-8oF4FPSQA&feature=related
<DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
<FireLight> good afternoom everypony ^^
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Balladshy (Fluttershy&#39;s Theme) [Original] (Feat. Frederic Horseshoepin)
<Flutteryay> KITTY!
<MrPoniator> Too bad it's starting to get darker in Finland each day now
<Stomper> well we can take a few tousand people
<MrPoniator> Can't really play Boktai unless I get an ultraviolet lamp
<Flutteryay> :3
<Stomper> so we hope to get a lot of people lol
<Iks> its getting darker everywhere on the northern hemisphere
<MrPoniator> True dat
<Iks> its so depressing
<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<MrPoniator> But eh, I like winter
<Nittany_Tiger> Katrina-Sharpie is her name.
<RobotPinkie> aw kitteh :3
<MrPoniator> Just that not much for playing Boktai outside until spring
<VioletVanilla> 6Who is Stomper in Bronychat? o:
<Iks> well lets home it doesnt get as bad as the last one
<prince-dari> Well that's what you'll get when S2 starts.
<prince-dari> :)
<Iks> you know the winters the past couple of years got colder and colder each year
<Stomper> S2?
*RDash just got two kittens
<FireLight> here is raining and hailing
<banannagram> ran out of excitement for s2 a week ago
<MrPoniator> Not that much different in Finland, except more snow
<Thunder_Dash> Lemme see if I can find any pictures of my cats...
<Flutteryay> So cute
<Iks> and yet they scream to us about global warming and how we need to shovel billions of taxmoney to the carbonnazis so they can save the planet
*LunaTheForgotten was never a cat person
<MrPoniator> But a few years back there was hardly any snow
*roushguy takes a deep breath and bursts into 'Winter Wrap Up'
<prince-dari> Series 2.
<RDash> I don't have any pics yet, one of them is sick :(
<banannagram> maybe I'll get some more on tuesday
<Zanzibar> Random: I've been thinking of how they'd hold magic contests in Equestria. Skill competitions and the like. It's surprisingly hard. Tournament style contests works, but I find that to be way too limiting.
<banannagram> season not series
<Colgate> probably won't get more than 100 or so
<prince-dari> Series for me.
<Rainbow_Dash> Hi RDash
<prince-dari> I'm in the UK.
<RDash> We're picking them up tomorrow
<prince-dari> :>
<RDash> Hi Rainbow_Dash
<banannagram> :<
<MrPoniator> Who knows, maybe that happens in S2 and we get to see Trixie!
<roushguy> afk
<Rainbow_Dash> Also.. In that new S2 picture.. RAINBOW DASHS CUTIE MARK IS BACKWARDS
<prince-dari> More than 100 for S2?
<LunaTheForgotten> BRB
<roushguy> Playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution
<RDash> :O
<prince-dari> What are you smoking? :P
<prince-dari> We get 200+ just for BMN.
<Stomper> na ay more than 100
<Zanzibar> It might be more along the line of themed contests perhaps. Magic related to a certain topic? But then I've had trouble thinking up different "spells" related to random subjects.
<Colgate> on average
<Stomper> way
<Zanzibar> Deus Ex: HR is a great game, have fun :)
<ValtheJean> To Subway, or not to Subway? That, is the question
<FireLight> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/55797
<MrPoniator> Never played Deus Ex
<DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about fluttershy Soul your_soul_is_mine demon
<Glenndy> hi guys
<ValtheJean> Whether tis nobler in the eyes of the stomach to ingest tasty bread
<Flutteryay> oh my
<ValtheJean> yeah I'm done :P
<LvS> hi
<banannagram> brb
<MrPoniator> Yo
<Flutteryay> Also... SWEETIE BELLE WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE CLOUDS?
<Colgate> EqD only has ~100 ponies in it on average, and they have a flash irc link on the main site
<GlenndyLikesPonies> what are you guys chatting about ?
<Colgate> most kids these days just don't know what IRC is :/
<MrPoniator> Ponies and games, I suppose
<Iks> and vanishing sunlight
<Flutteryay> SWEETIEPOO! OOPEITEEWS!
<GlenndyLikesPonies> cool i cant wait untill season 2
<Stomper> true, but to sat we will only have a 100 is really not giving enough cred
<FireLight> dumb youtube -.-
<Iks> indeed
<GlenndyLikesPonies> Dumb Fabric :)
<Michael89pl> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:17h:16m:07s
<Stomper> hopefully our hard work to get this done (not so much mine, idk programmig) withh pay off
<Iks> dumb rock
<InsertCupcake> my flash player keeps crashing
<Sumica> That rainbow dash is a spy
<Sidestroke> Too long.
<MrPoniator> Currently listening to dem Mega Man music on YOuTube without a problem
<Sidestroke> Megaman soundtracks, woot.
<Sidestroke> Which, may I ask?
<Colgate> not so much programming, just server admin, unless you coded your own irc server ;)
<Stomper> keyboard sucks btw, please forgive some typos
<Stomper> ask Pontang
<Stomper> he did servers
<Stomper> and Awesomeshy did the site
<[NLR]Lucid> what is this?
<Stomper> both did a lot of work, i come in after everything gets going really
<SummerRain> ..o.o
<MrPoniator> Rina Aiuchi - CODE CRUSH (Rockman X7 japanese theme) song currently
<[NLR]Lucid> And why is there no sound?
<Stomper> im PR person lol
<MrPoniator> Going through these randomly
<RDash> [NLR]Lucid Dari is tinkering methinks
<[NLR]Lucid> Ah
<Iks> oh new season 2 pic on the site.... brown rain?
<ValtheJean> yeah...brb...I'm gona get me a sammich
<LunaOnTheMoon> !link happy
<DerpyBot> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/23141
<MrPoniator> Dem chocolate rain
<RDash> I think that's an old stream
<[NLR]Lucid> It's a Gundam!
<Thunder_Dash> Managed to find an ooold picture of two of my cats on my Facebook of all places
<Thunder_Dash> http://i.imgur.com/aUBqt.jpg
<prince-dari> Heheh, cute, Thunder_Dash.
<FloofCat> Nice kittycat.
<Colgate> I just think you overestimate the tech literacy of most people, hard enough sometimes teaching ponies what an IRC client is sometimes
<MrPoniator> That comic is cute
<Thunder_Dash> Thanks ^^;
<RDash> Thunder_Dash Daww
<Twilight> Um, Hi ya'll. ^^;
<LvS> hi
<LunaOnTheMoon> Hi twilight
<Twilight> ...*didn't realize the name cut off.
<roushguy> Hello Twilight
<FloofCat> My cat's a monster... and that sound was horrible. :P
<MrPoniator> Heya Blaze
<Twilight_Blaze> |D Two seconds in and I already imbares myself.
<MrPoniator> Heh
<Rainbow_Dash> Prince-Dari
<Rainbow_Dash> I regret to inform you that Rainbow Dash's cutie mark is backwards in that S2 picture
<MrPoniator> So what're you fellas doing?
<Twilight_Blaze> I've uh, just kinda been enjoying MLP from affar for a while now and I thought I might dip a hoof into the fandom so to speak.
<Thunder_Dash> I'm still not seeing the stream... Going to refresh
<MrPoniator> Alrighty, that's cool
<roushguy> welcome to the herd!
<Stomper> well i guess we will see, we have high hopes
<Stomper> im hoping youll be here
<Twilight_Blaze> Thanks. ^^
*FreezeFrame watches schadenpony
<Stomper> if your right we need al the help we need and every pony counts
<LunaOnTheMoon> Yes, Welcome to the herd.
<Thunder_Dash> Is the stream actually up? On Dinkypage I just see the UStream recording, on co.cc it says "Offline"...
<LunaOnTheMoon> Be wary of parasprites and love and tolerate the shit out of everyone
<Colgate> well, I will at least until I get unbanned from the EqD channel
<Pontang> o.o
<Stomper> if you do you will go there instead?
<Wrek> 05i second that idea
<Colgate> I'll at least idle in both
<FloofCat> http://miburl.com/TaEpI1 <-- My cat.
<Twilight_Blaze> *nods* Will do and thanks.
<Colgate> cause IRC, it is made for idling!
<Stomper> well your always welcome here
<Stomper> indeed it is lol
<roushguy> oh
<roushguy> And careful of some of the fanfic
<roushguy> Some of it is DEMENTED
<Twilight_Blaze> Like that one my friend tells me about staring Pinkie?
<MrPoniator> And well, checking out fanfic really depends if that's your thing
<Twilight_Blaze> *shivers* Ya, not a fan of horror.
<roushguy> That'd be Cupcakes
<LunaOnTheMoon> yes, be careful of what you read
<roushguy> Also 'ware Rocket To Insanity
<Thunder_Dash> D'awwww~ XD
<Stomper> i dont usually idle though, i wait around and convers with people
<LunaOnTheMoon> Can derpybot be setup to recognize instances of Cupcakes in 24h ours periods? I haven't seen the law broken yet
<WhatPayne> That's one cute fur pile
<Stomper> gets boring lol
<Stomper> which is why i hope lots of ponies come
<MrPoniator> You know, if you don't want people to read some fanfic, why is it necessary to bring them up every now and then?
<Colgate> well, can't be active in all my channels at once
<FloofCat> Heh... it's attacking my chair right now. It was even cuter as a kitten...
<Stomper> very true
<FloofCat> http://miburl.com/GU9Fxx <-- Kitten pic
<Stomper> just be sure to come by us often ;D
<FloofCat> brb, gonna feed it.
<MrPoniator> I don't like or want to check out a lot of stuff, but I don't bash myself about it
<roushguy> I just said their names
<LunaOnTheMoon> Same reason you look down when ponies tell you not to
<roushguy> Not the stuff in it
<roushguy> I don't want them to accidentally stumble onto them and get mentally scarred
<Pontang> You're being too sappy Stomper.
<Pontang> :x
<FreezeFrame> Ugh, Accounting book is not the best reading in the world.
<LunaOnTheMoon> !s2
<DerpyBot> Season 2 begins in 7d:17h:00m:18s
<Stomper> na im not
<MrPoniator> True, but you'd rather let it sink with not talking about it
<Stomper> just want new peopel to feel welcome
<Stomper> you know
<MrPoniator> Though, that fic will likely never sink, but oh well
<Stomper> honey and not vinigar
<Stomper> or something
<Pontang> Colgate: why did you get banned from the Equestria channel?
<Stomper> idk i didnt sleep last night
<Twilight_Blaze> Season 2! <3 Really hope we see more Sweetie Bell.
<Stomper> oh ya do tell
<Twilight_Blaze> And Luna.
<LunaOnTheMoon> I hope we get more of me!
<Colgate> an op disagreed with my opinion on anon comments on EqD posts
<LunaOnTheMoon> well, more Luna, less OnTheMoon
<Pontang> I see
<Twilight_Blaze> XD
<Iks> more luna yay
<FloofCat> I'm sure it's not good for eating, either - there's no accounting for taste.
<Colgate> if they hadn't resorted to insults before banning me, it wouldn't be so bad
<Stomper> oh, not so contraversal lol
<Pontang> Hmm
<Colgate> but, it just sounds like "I'm an op, so fuck you"
<Pontang> People can be like that.
<Colgate> http://pastebin.com/56Nu0k4F
<Stomper> brb
<Colgate> probably not very exciting, but meh
<MrPoniator> I hope we get more of everypony!
<MrPoniator> Because everyone knows everypony is the best pony
<gingerale> Huh? Why hasn't Seth posted this yet? http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Trixie-Pose-1-257557272
<Pontang> wb
<banannagram> hi
<Pontang> Hello
<MrPoniator> He's preparing a massive wall of text to explain how much he loves it
<gingerale> :o
<Twilight_Blaze> Oh wow.
<banannagram> hey
<RobotPinkie> I miss my mom's old cat. :( http://i.imgur.com/gYCox.jpg http://i.imgur.com/7lbd8.jpg
<LunaOnTheMoon> Luna was better :(
<MrPoniator> That's pretty well done for certain
<gingerale> This one is shinier
<LunaOnTheMoon> This one is very, very impressive
<Pontang> So what's going on?
<LunaOnTheMoon> But Luna makes everything better
<FloofCat> That's a beauty. Reminds me of the kitten my neighbor abandoned a bit over a week ago, that we were taking care of until 2 days ago, when I placed it.
<banannagram> not much
<Nashy> Trixies gonna trix
<LvS> she looks like she thinks she's in a smash bros game
<Pontang> Ended up falling asleep earlier. I always hate when I oversleep on naps. :(
<FloofCat> How do I direct-thumbnail it, just paste the image URL?
<RAWRity> yes
