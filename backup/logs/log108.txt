<Jayne_Cobb> Well, that was interesting.
<Dermathil> Denied_Existence, who said I wanted it to explode? Maybe just shut it donw?
<Ghosties> 4Looks like House...finally busted his balls
<GGgala_> herospirit: his testicles?

<Nittany_Tiger> He's got big balls now.
<DecapKing> Octavia Y U NO TALK?
<Denied_Existence> Dermathil Then why didn't you just turn it off? There is a big emergency off switch on it!
<Kencolt706> We don't., We're not even looking at you. It's merely knowing that you are restrained that comforts us.
<RobotPinkie> >mfw Dermathil wants to kill me

<RobotPinkie> lolz
*herospirit kicks the wall Pegacorn is chained to
<Denied_Existence> Dermathil, but that doesn't mean the pack has a radio receiver or that its electronics are connected to RobotPinkie....
<Ghosties> 4Because I'm having sex with Cuddy says Winston's inner conscious
<herospirit> I tried. :0
<Dermathil> Just keep you on the moon

<Denied_Existence> OH GOD DERMATHIL, YOU HACKED A REAL REACTOR!!!!

<ValtheJean> 2,14>mfw I have no idea what bad wolf is

<Razyn> 0Well, maybe the random factor
<Siegi> In a childish way i guess
<Dermathil> did you see the non-canon episode with Mr Beans becoming a woman, Valthejean?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nope
<GGgala_> Dermathil: Greek mythology? But the resurrection of Lazarus is.. in the New Testament o_0
<prince-dari> Oh God that's brilliant.

<prince-dari> You thought all of what are comic relief?
<Siegi> Mr Bean
<prince-dari> What do you mean, you think all things with Mr Bean in are comic relief? O_o
<GGgala_> Siegi: Comic Relief, is a charity name
<Razyn> 0Turns out Lazarus was one of those more famous blokes to be resurrected by Jesus

<Daz> well okie then. I still wanna make one but don't know what on D:
<MeteorVenture> actually i guess i did load a little something
<RobotPinkie> just need to find the right image of Pinkie from behind

<RobotPinkie> having a hard time finding just the right pic though
<Daz> RobotPinkie: if ya tell me more i can help out finding pics
<Daz> just any old pic from behind? or ... what
<WhatPayne> Ok, I'll have to go, now. I might drop by at some point later on through my mobile phone
<Daz> catch ya later, WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> cya
<RobotPinkie> just need a pic from behind where you can see her head and her arms raised... but that's proving tricky :P
<Daz> arms raised above head you mean?
<RobotPinkie> well, or to the sides of her head
<Daz> well ok i'll just plug in my harddrive and search through pics :P
<RobotPinkie> I haven't even found one where she's on her hind legs from that angle :P
<MeteorVenture> well since internet isn't working well i guess it's festers quest time
<Rodman> Is Dari online, or atleast one of the mods?
<Rodman> The LQ stream is broken
<Daz> Luna should be
<Daz> and Rodman luna doesn't stream LQ so that'd be why
<RobotPinkie> best would be if she's reaching for something, but eh... i'm not picky
<Daz> luna just streams normally, one stream, that's it
<Rodman> ok
<Daz> ok Rodman ih ave 1 so far
<Daz> RobotPinkie *
<Daz> silly Tab
<mib_aoelbl> so i heard you like ponies

<Daz> Rodman: i meant it for RobotPinkie. i'm 1/8th ish into my pinkie pics and found one
<Rodman> A plot pic?
<Daz> well kinda. it's not actually official pic, but looks good.
<Rodman> Just use the scene where Pinkie monologues in Party of One before kidnapping Spike
<RobotPinkie> well, it's going to be a bit blurred anyway, so it doesn't have to look perfect
<mib_aoelbl> I want a duck tape boat!

<mib_aoelbl> watching this I can't help but feel incredibly jealous of the mythbusters, manly due to the weird shit they do
<RobotPinkie> What a stud!
<RobotPinkie> and yeah I know, the Mythbusters have the greatest job evar
<Daz> eh, sure that's a downside, RobotPinkie, girls want guys that last at least more than 10 secs im sure xD
<RobotPinkie> Not Rainbow Dash!
<mib_aoelbl> who wouldn't want to do what they do!
<Rodman> Daz, Trixie looks like she is going to derp more than anything, given her right eye
<Daz> haha Rodman
<RobotPinkie> at least 2000 of the view on the Trixie vid are Sethisto
<Daz> lawl
<Rodman> Also, job as a Mythbuster
<Daz> where are all the dari RD views then?
<mib_aoelbl> 'I can't answer that I'm tying a pigs stomach into a skeleton!'
<Rodman> Best. Work Accidents. Ever.
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, you'll have to ask dari, Daz :P
<Daz> lawl
<Rodman> DARI, Y U NO CLOP?!?!
<Rodman> Waaaaaaaaaaaaait...........
<Rodman> That didn't come out right.
<RobotPinkie> ....
<Daz> .......
<mib_aoelbl> c4
<RobotPinkie> lawl
*Rodman goes to reflect about life on the corner.
<RobotPinkie> One of my favorite Mythbusters quotes is "When in doubt... C4"
<mib_aoelbl> so i hear that season 2 will be streamed here...
<Rodman> Yes it will
<RobotPinkie> That's the plan, yup
<Rodman> And undoubtedly be up on Youtube within a few hours after release
<RobotPinkie> dat Luna wallpaper!
<mib_aoelbl> hahahahhahahahaha
<mib_aoelbl> zat iz correct
<RobotPinkie> oui
<EspyLacopa> 15 days until the sun shall rise. . .
<Rodman> Look at all these flour! Imma make a cake now!
<Rodman> Longest 15 days ever...........
<RobotPinkie> NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOO
*RobotPinkie dies
<mib_aoelbl> I made cake once.... it compacted itself into an incredibly dense blob
*Rodman turns RobotPinkie into a cyborg cake
<Daz> Hey, how do youtube vids autoloop? is that up to the uploader or something?
<Rodman> Yes, and done with annotations
*Luna uses a loop site
<mib_aoelbl> you don't want to mix blur, with blur
*Daz uses an addon for chrome giving him a 'Loop' button below the vid.
<CyborgCake> THAT IS AFFIRMATIVE
<Daz> BUT some vids loop without me activating my loop
<Luna> 07hit me with a PM link
<Daz> PM link?
<Daz> to addon, Luna
<Luna> 07yes
<Daz> I'd be very happy to link you 2 AMAZING youtube addons!
<Daz> brb!
<Daz> ok got one Luna g2 find the other now
<RobotPinkie> If you want a youtube video to loop, just add "loop" before the ".com"
<RobotPinkie> srsly, it works...
<Daz> RobotPinkie, but this button addon lets you select loop and unloop without refreshing anything :P
<mib_aoelbl> dingleburg
<RobotPinkie> presuming you can have addons everywhere you want to use it :P
<Daz> FEAST YOUR CHROME ON THE BEST YOUTUBE ADDONS https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/komdpgcendeaaddpemccikagnfancgoc https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfllkgkeiciklnenppokkgkmbjnoeodn?hc=search&hcp=main

<Rodman> Huh, why Daz?
<InsertCupcake> random yay
<Rodman> Do I need to DL something?
<RobotPinkie> that's for downloading videos, not looping

<Apokalipse> You want to loop a video?
<RobotPinkie> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-auto-replay-11636/ That's for looping
<Rodman> ITS LOOPING TIME

<Rodman> SH2?
<Pinkie_Pie> Silent Hill 2

<Rodman> Do it
<RobotPinkie> SH2 is amazing, Pinkie_Pie, so yes.
<Rodman> DO EET!
<RobotPinkie> You should play it :P
<Pinkie_Pie> I know, I like the idea of the story. It sounds interesting
<Pinkie_Pie> Im going to right now. Im gonna find that flashlight >=O
<RobotPinkie> and Youtube video downloader is great when there's a vid you want. 720p mp4 files ftw.
<Rodman> Couldn't agree more even if agreeing would result in the Golden Age of Blowjobs
<Rodman> SH2 is absolutely awesome and scary
<Daz> RobotPinkie: ikr, but also also i love it cuz: 360p is my phone's resolution, and my iPod classic resolution. Download, copy, VIEW =D =D
<RobotPinkie> SH2 has one of the best scripts of video game history, in my view
<Rodman> Though I'm also the kind of guy who likes the campy horror of the RE games
<Rodman> Gonna restart Firefox
<Rodman> BRB
<RobotPinkie> Well, me too, Rodman, though I kinda prefer more serious horror games
<RobotPinkie> ...with the exception of the campy awesomeness of Illbleed
<Daz> LSD dream emulator is scary as hell.
<EspyLacopa> RobotPinkie: Old-school Alone in the Dark?
<RobotPinkie> I love Alone in the Dark 1-3, wasn't a big fan of New Nightmare or whatever it was called, Ets
<RobotPinkie> lol EspyLacopa, I mean

<AllisZero> Holy crap what a marathon
<Nittany_Tiger> I didn't watch Enterprise through.
<Nittany_Tiger> I know it was cut short due to lack of interest, though.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, which is too bad because it was getting really good :(
<Nittany_Tiger> Pissed some fans off because they said it was not following the canon timeline as well.
<RobotPinkie> not TNG good, but eh, beggars can't be choosers :P
<EspyLacopa> Kirk or Picard?
<Wrek> 06picard
<RobotPinkie> I know... but I personally don't care about the canon timeline... they've changed the course of history more than once on Star Trek
<Nittany_Tiger> Dunno.
<EspyLacopa> Didn't they go time traveling to save Aquaman's whales?
<RobotPinkie> I'd say Picard, easily
<Wrek> 06another *brohoof coming your way RobotPinkie
<RobotPinkie> yeah that's one of the times, EspyLacopa
<Nittany_Tiger> They did in the 4th movie (The Original Series).
<Rodman> Good God, the stream is being horrible to me
<mib_aoelbl> true'
<Rodman> 1 second of stream, then frozen for a minute
<RobotPinkie> weird, stream's working well for me now
<Nittany_Tiger> They had to travel to the '80s to bring back wales before a probe killed everything on Earth in their present.
<Nittany_Tiger> *whales
<Nittany_Tiger> Love how James Rolfe called it a log of shit with a disco ball.
<mib_aoelbl> it was shit for me at the start now its good
<RobotPinkie> also they travelled back in time in the TNG movie "First Contact"
<EspyLacopa> <in Aquaman voice> Whaaaaales
<Rodman> THEY HAD TO SAVE ALL THE WELSH SO THE SPACE WELSH WOULDN'T KILL THEM!
<Rodman> IT ALL MAKES SENSE!
<Nittany_Tiger> Yes.
<mib_aoelbl> I'm going to bed nowz
<Nittany_Tiger> TNG did time travel in the series.
<EspyLacopa> What about the Space Australians?
<Daz> Luna, did the extensions work? just askin' cuz i have previous versions so ya i hope they did
<RobotPinkie> night, mib_aoelbl anon
<Daz> nait nait mib_aoelbl
<Nittany_Tiger> TNG did it multiple times in fact.
<RobotPinkie> Yep, Nittany_Tiger. So... that's why I'm not really too concerned with canon in the show
<Rodman> At what point did time travel in Star Trek end up with the Nazis controlling earth?
<RobotPinkie> haha, yay Luna
<Rodman> Because I remember an episode of that, but not which series
<Rodman> And I mean all the newer ones, not the original series
<RobotPinkie> no idea, Rodman
<Nittany_Tiger> Didn't know about that episode.
<Pinkie_Pie> Okay, I played enough.. Saw pyramid head.. Got tired of fooling with the clock
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<RobotPinkie> lol okay, Pinkie_Pie
<Rodman> You and your clock-fooling
<RobotPinkie> had a good scary time? :P
<Pinkie_Pie> I guess
<Rodman> At least its better than dicking around with the clock in the mess hall in Resident evil
<Rodman> Goddamn I hated that puzzle
<Pinkie_Pie> Silent Hill isnt to scary for me, but it does have an atmosphere good enough to keep me on edge
<RobotPinkie> I love the puzzles in SH2-3
<Rodman> What about Amnesia?
<RobotPinkie> very cleverly designed
<Pinkie_Pie> I refuse to play Amnesia
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<Rodman> Why Pinkie?
<Pinkie_Pie> I would if there was some sort of weapon
<Pinkie_Pie> But just having to run and close doors
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall, learn to face your fears
<Pinkie_Pie> I would die so many times
<Pinkie_Pie> I know >.<
<RobotPinkie> You'll see that they can't hurt you just laugh and make them dissapear!
<Rodman> That's kind of the point Pinkie_Pie
<RobotPinkie> disappear, even :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Maybe once I have played Silent Hill I will be prepared for Amnesia
<Pinkie_Pie> But I gotta do SH first
<Rodman> Speaking of Amnesia, say good bye to your lungs and tracheas
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmaGcYf0IpI
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Amnesia Funtage - Funny Freakouts" - "Please like and favorite the video if you enjoyed it! :D So ye, stopped the Amnesia series as it was coming to the point where I would spend 2 hours editing ..."
<RobotPinkie> Haven't been scared by a game since I watched episode 2 of FiM :(
<Pinkie_Pie> You know, I stopped being afraid of video games after I read cupcakes
<Pinkie_Pie> I feel braver almost. XD
<Pinkie_Pie> Grimdark makes me stronger and more prepared for scary games
<Pinkie_Pie> Is that bad?
<Rodman> Its that funny
<RobotPinkie> Not really bad, no.
<Rodman> BRB
<EspyLacopa> I don't think Star Trek has an official canon anymore, what with tall the time travel shenanigans.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, that's pretty much my stance on it :P
<EspyLacopa> *with all the
<Nittany_Tiger> I can watch later Saw movies and be fine (later ones are gory).
<RobotPinkie> Quite gory, yeah.
<Rodman> Gore=/=horror
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<Rodman> It does equal torture porn though
<Nittany_Tiger> Earlier ones had less gore but were better.
<Rodman> Exactly
<Nittany_Tiger> In fact, 1 had very little gore.
<RobotPinkie> Not really... Hostel 1&2 equal torture porn, pretty much :P
<RobotPinkie> I really can't stand those movies, they're just so bad.
<EspyLacopa> Signs was an interesting horror movie. . .until they showed the monster getting beat up with a baseball bat and water.
<Rodman> Worst. Aliens. Ever.
<RobotPinkie> lol pretty much
<Rodman> "HEY! LETS INVADE THE PLANET WHERE THE DOMINANT SUBTANCE IS POSION TO US!"
<RobotPinkie> Shyamalan hasn't made a good movie since Unbreakable, as far as I'm concerned
<EspyLacopa> "Everyone have a bat?" "Mine has a nail in it, score!"
<Rodman> *poison
<Nittany_Tiger> That's "War of the Worlds."
<Rodman> Water wasn't poisonous to those guys Nittany
<Nittany_Tiger> And our water didn't kill them. It was the microbes that they had no immune defense against.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah and the aliens running around in mist and morning dew without a problem....
<Nittany_Tiger> I know Rodman. Just said that it was the microbes in the water.
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't recall water killing the Signs aliens.
<Rodman> Are you talking Signs or War of the Worlds?
<Nittany_Tiger> But I haven't seen that movie in ages.
<Nittany_Tiger> War of the Worlds.
<RobotPinkie> I'm pretty sure they said it was just water, lol
<Rodman> I'm talking Signs........
<Rodman> WRONG PAGE!
<EspyLacopa> I did like Unbreakable.
<Nittany_Tiger> Oh yeah.
<EspyLacopa> With the fragile villain.
<EspyLacopa> "Quick, shove him down the stairs!"
<RobotPinkie> and again, running around naked in water vapor without a problem....
<Rodman> RobotPinkie, you sure like to do some weird stuff
<RobotPinkie> Signs just annoyed me on so many levels, though it did start out pretty well
<RobotPinkie> lol Rodman, I'm talking about the aliens in Signs
<Nittany_Tiger> Swing away!
<Rodman> Yeah...... sure you were.
<Rodman> :D
<Pinkie_Pie> Oh dear
<RobotPinkie> I run around naked in the blistering hot summer sun in the middle of Sweden's capital
<RobotPinkie> BIG difference
<EspyLacopa> Stampeding cattle. . .in the vatican.
<Rodman> Oh okay
<RobotPinkie> :P

<prince-dari> Flutteryay, wut?
<Flutteryay> he posted this
<Flutteryay> "Being a devout Christian, I believe that homosexuality is morally wrong, and unnatural. It is a choice you make, not something you can't."
<Purple`Prose> ...

<RobotPinkie> They do, Flutteryay?
<FreezeFrame> Same as any group, you have the loud jackasses.

<PinkieThePie> Why does break dancing always look like somebody falling down invisible stairs for extended periods of time?
<VioletVanilla> The high pitch is destroying my hearing x.x
<sotha> I used to be able to play that song.
<Marzai> Because you have an awesome sense of humor, Pinkie.
<RobotPinkie> what is going on?
<Fuzz> because nobody warned them about stairs
<sotha> That's awesome Pinkie. I need to remember it.

<Razyn> I miss Toonami ;_;
<prince-dari> Stream's up now.
<RobotPinkie> bass is delicious, VioletVanilla
<Yoshyi> Really? I'll try refreshing then
<PinkieThePie> Toonami actually introduced me to some of my favorite manga
<Yoshyi> There we go, thanks
<prince-dari> Top Gear will probably be buffered enough to continue in a minute.
<Razyn> ?
<VioletVanilla> @RobotPinkie And I'm talking about Double Bass~
<PinkieThePie> another one?
<sotha> I prefer the first one. I think.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<RobotPinkie> Double bass, VioletVanilla? That sounds twice as delicious!
<VioletVanilla> <33
<Fuzz> oh

<Yoshyi> I suddenly feel awkward....
<VioletVanilla> And then . . .
<Marzai> Up for grabs.
<PinkieThePie> what is going on here? I feel uncomfortable
<VioletVanilla> EVERYPONY CAME
<prince-dari> VioletVanilla: You know me too well. :P
<Fuzz> thank you *wipes himself off*
<Fuzz> now you. miss pony. I demand you cease
<Wrek> 06mfw i counted all the names with pinkie in them

<VioletVanilla> :3 Oh I do prince-dari~
<Wrek> 06quite.
<Fuzz> well
<Fuzz> pinkie = best pony
<prince-dari> Silvermane enters to this.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Purple`Prose> I prefer Twilight, personally
<Marzai> That made me nervous for some reason.
<Solarboy> Hi Ponies
<Purple`Prose> Hi
<Wrek> 06ohey
<Marzai> Yo.
<PinkieThePie> I would have gone with my fav pony, but I couldn't think of anything clever to do with Rarity
<LavenderGraves> greetings everypony
<PinkyPyro> well applejackpyro didn't sound right
*Silvermane gives Rainbow Dash something to stare at
<prince-dari> XD
<Yoshyi> Hi, Lavender
<Solarboy> I like how the stream doesn't load up when I'm at school.
<Marzai> Because it's school.
<Marzai> They got dem defensez.
*Silvermane glomps ReticentSmolder "Hey brony!"
<RobotPinkie> Well, Rarity doesn't even look remotely similar to "Pika", so...
<Fuzz> i need more bronies. Most of the people i know irl dont know how to love and tolerate
<PinkieThePie> Hey Dash, mind backing up some? You're stepping on my toes here
<Purple`Prose> I think I've found a themesong for Dash
<Marzai> Ah, I'm in the same boat as Fuzz.
<VioletVanilla> DARI YES DARI YEEESSS
<VioletVanilla> XDDDD
<Marzai> Wth?
<Bass_Note> so wait, whens the next show? 11 pacific time?
<Purple`Prose> safe to link?
<Silvermane> i like this version
<prince-dari> I'm not playing requests right now.
<PinkieThePie> Rainbow Juice? i don't wanna know
<prince-dari> Sathi probably will for the preshow.
<Fuzz> ok sweet
<Silvermane> Ponies: Making Katey Perry bearable
<Fuzz> no. katy perry is never bearable
<Fuzz> pinkie pie wrote this song
<PinkieThePie> Mostly because they got rid of anything Perry did
<Silvermane> ^
*Silvermane wonders if the line is Furry Coats or Furry Colts...
<VioletVanilla> ^^
<FreezeFrame> Katy Perry isn't that bad.
<Marzai> That was pretty neat.
<Marzai> Even though I died inside.
<Marzai> Just a bit.
<PinkieThePie> Because I know damn well she didn't do the production on that song
<Purple`Prose> More Top Gear! :D
<RobotPinkie> lol Silvermane
<VioletVanilla> Alright~ :3
<Fuzz> MO tawp gearz
<Marzai> It was furry colts.
<RobotPinkie> I'm sure you want it to be the latter :P
<prince-dari> Colts was a typo.
<prince-dari> It's meant to be coats.
<Marzai> Orly?
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Yoshyi> Coats would make more sense
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> MFW video isn't centred.
<Silvermane> Oh ok, it would be weird if Pinkie was being so purposefully referring to males being cute, as if her character had a sex drive
<prince-dari> Whoops.
<Marzai> It would.
<PinkieThePie> that is a bright 8 O clock
<Purple`Prose> They're in the Arctic Circle
<PinkieThePie> I know, I'm just saying
<Fuzz> arr once in the arctic
<Purple`Prose> Luna approves?
<Brony17> ugu!
<PinkieThePie> that camera guy must be freezing
<Marzai> You're worried about just the camera guy?
<Fuzz> camera guy's probably got mad heating gear
<PinkieThePie> hoshit polar bear

<prince-dari> Well you don't need a license plate where they are. :P
<Dermathil> hehehehe
<nate> chainsaws!!!!
<prince-dari> Hmm, I want Hammond to win.
<zackogenic> trolololololol
<Purple`Prose> DRAMATIC MUSIC

<MirrorImage> hmmm... ignore what i said a moment ago about "full speed"
<Purple`Prose> POWAAAAAAAAA
<Yoshyi> Epic tundra driving....
<prince-dari> felren: I just appreciate what Hammond did as a bigger achievement.
<[NLR]Lucid> POWAHHHH
<prince-dari> So I'd rather he won.
<felren> What do you mean?
<anon> i thought they were supposed to be keeping the car intact
<disaidra> 6:P
<nate> @yoshyi it's actually a hilux
<RMoD> 0they're losing everything out the back xD
<[NLR]Lucid> Well, no. Because several people have taken dogsleds to the pole, nobody had ever driven
<Yoshyi> ....
<MirrorImage> based on the shock they pulled out when they lost the first fuel take, i think that's a long abandoned goal anon
<prince-dari> Yeah, but they didn't build the car.
<Yoshyi> They're in the tundra, aren't they?
<Purple`Prose> Hiluxes are indestructable
<Yoshyi> Or is my geography that bad?
<Purple`Prose> they're in the north pole
<prince-dari> All they're doing is driving it.

<WorkbenchManiac> I like your food as well, then I came across Marmite
<EspyLacopa> Bakura with bangers and nash?
<prince-dari> Probably, but it's up to Sathi.
<Daz> okie
<InsertCupcake> But whats not to love about a yeast based spread?
<Monkey_Zombie> I don't get any fancy food I'm stuck in America
<Daz> Only men are allowed the ENGLISH BREAKFAST

<Monkey_Zombie> I prefer Ierish coffee
<Daz> trademark
<WorkbenchManiac> Well, primarily the "yeast based bread spread"-part
<Spin> American food= perservatives

<Lordlyhour> Australia is the fanciest Damn country in the world

<french> Who's discord?
<Spin> No
<InsertCupcake> oh hai stream
<french> ohaither
<Silverscreen> 11No idea, to be honest.
<Daz> french: SPOILERS for season 2 of 'friendship is magic'
<Dermathil> Discord is a S2 character. Nothing is known except he's a male
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties is usually here, but it all depends on his internet and availability.
<EspyLacopa> And he's named Discord.
<Daz> neenjad
<french> S2 Spoilers!!!
<ninjapwny> NO SPOILERS
<Sidworth> and he has a grey rainbow dash
<ninjapwny> JERKS
<french> Why do i miss everything exciting!
<Monkey_Zombie> I wanna see a satirical comic about foreign relations and current events using ponies
<Sidworth> who's gay
<Daz> Sidworth, who's European? :P
<Nyst> Are there any brabant ponies?
<Lordlyhour> OHsnap
<french> OH! i saw the rbd
<Dermathil> I just said what's been known through EqD posts, not through a certain picture that basically spoils the ENTIRE 2-parter
<Dermathil> because of that picture I know exactly WHAT makes Dash grey
<Monkey_Zombie> RBD is the FAX.
<french> When was this? I've been away for about a month :'(
<InsertCupcake> I think I do but I hope im wrong
<Dermathil> French, about a week or two ago
<RAWRity> ah, this wonderful anthology. First fan-made pony thing I ever saw
<french> Dermathil Oooh, it's exciting!
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> but don't try to look for it.
<Nyst> A brabant pony can pull 17000 pounds? You find all kinds of things on the internet.
<Dermathil> I'm feeling sad due to it being spoiled to me.
<Monkey_Zombie> I first saw the Fallout Equestria story.
<prince-dari> Sathi's up with the stream by the way.
<french> Okey Dokey Lokey ^^
<Monkey_Zombie> Now I'm hooked

<Luna> 07yes please

<PurpleDoom> back guys
<ReticentSmolder> dat background flash
<ninjapwny> r u guys taking requests?
<ninjapwny> cause we should totally play the dramatic reading of the MLP theme
<Luna> 07nah it's 23:40 here and after the anthology it's showtime
<Nyst> Hey um, does the show ever explain why there are no adult ponies? (i.e. horses?)
<Alyure> Oh shit I remember Bonecrusher!!
<Silverscreen> 11!
<ninjapwny> they DIED
<Zecora> !
<Luna> 07Do we have any news for our viewers this week?
<Spin> Pony war
<Silverscreen> 11!
<ninjapwny> !
<InsertCupcake> !
<Alyure> Celestia is a horse......
<Lucid> Adult ponies are still ponies
<Nyst> Actually, isn't Celestia a horse?
<Dark_Heart> Pinkie Pie
<Silverscreen> 11TWIIIIIIIIIILIIIIIIIIIIGHT!
<Trooper7psp> SNAAAAAKEEE
<PurpleDoom> theres nothing wrong with being in an IRC chat and watching pony videos while making my own dinner is there?
<Alyure> And discord is probably also a horsed
<Lordlyhour> Pony is the Name of their species
<Nyst> So Celestia is the only horse in all of equestria. Intriguing
<scamper> olol
<RAWRity> I remember loving that show as a kid
<Alyure> Not at all doom
<Silverscreen> 11Woody Woodpecker.
<PurpleDoom> yay!
<Alyure> Not at all
<Luna> 07- Recruiting - Valthejean -Rules anything else?
<Lordlyhour> Celestia is a goddes Incarnate
<Alyure> Oh shit blast from the past 80s music!!
<Whizz_Bang> but celestia is not a horse she is an alicorn
<Luna> 07Silver modroom please
<Madfish> So cute
<Lordlyhour> She could look like any damn thing she wanted
<Lucid> How do you know that there aren't any adults?
<Natleyn> Pinkie. ,3
<Natleyn> <3
<Monkey_Zombie> How did each pony evolve?
<Madfish> So creepy
<Silverscreen> 11Word of Lauren states that Celestia is a pony.
<Lordlyhour> Actually, I've found that suprisingly lacking in many fics
<PurpleDoom> Incoming Pasta! Need more carbs. While at the gym I was listning to Avast Shutterfly's Ass
<Madfish> Hit level 30
<Lucid> What the Fluttershy is this
<Alyure> That doesnt make sence
<Alyure> How is a pony that big?
<Lordlyhour> She could Literally Deconstruct the universe, and rebuild it without you In it
<Luna> 07*pokes the chat*
<Whizz_Bang> mr and mrs cake are adults
<ninjapwny> she's a mutant pwny
<Trooper7psp> granny smith?
<Spin> plus the oranges
<Monkey_Zombie> Celestia and luna look like they age
<Silverscreen> 11Alyure: The fanon is that her height is a direct result of the immense power she possesses.
<Nyst> So if ponies don't mature, that means they're all a bunch of manchildren?
<Lucid> Twilight Sparkle's parents are adults
<InsertCupcake> Celestia and Luna are gods though
<Nyst> Hey yeah; that's true.
<RAWRity> I miss when The Offspring made fun music.
<RandomExtra> Dat Skype
<Spin> Miracles
<Zecora> same with pinkies
<Lordlyhour> There are Adults
<Nyst> So mature ponies are basically offscreen.
<Alyure> Im sure Big.M is like 25-30
<Lordlyhour> They're just called Ponies
<InsertCupcake> Adults are still ponies
<Monkey_Zombie> I surmise that celestia and Luna are more of semi-gods.
<sotha> MUTE
<Lordlyhour> Pony is just a type of horse
<Luna> 07[23:41] <@Luna> Do we have any news for our viewers this week?
<Luna> 07[23:42] <@Luna> - Recruiting - Valthejean -Rules anything else?
<Luna> 07[23:43] <@Luna> *pokes the chat*
<Whizz_Bang> big mac is about 5
<Lordlyhour> Look at the Shetland pony'
<Silverscreen> I didn't get kick/banned now.
<Nyst> Yes but what does that make Twilight and friends? Adult ponies or not?
<Trooper7psp> like a puppy is a dog, i guess...
<Silverscreen> WHOO!
<Silverscreen> okay, to business.
<InsertCupcake> oh hai ghosties
<Lordlyhour> They be teens, yo
<Octavia> 14lol
<Alyure> I thought ponies were like baby horses?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ohai ghosties
<Ghosties> 4Hey
<Lordlyhour> Nuup
<Silverscreen> 11None that I can think of right now.
<ninjapwny> its teh ghosties
<ValtheJean> oh ghosties, daz was asking for you
<Lordlyhour> Foals are baby horses
<Lucid> Again, WTF is this? And they are probably somewhere between adults and children, i.e. teenagers
<Alyure> ah
<Nyst> Teens that get send on a dragon removal mission?
<RandomExtra> hi Ghosties!
<Monkey_Zombie> They aren't omnipotent or omnisentient therefore they can't be gods.
<Lordlyhour> Pony is just a term for a small horse
<RAWRity> nyst it seems they've old enough to have jobs and not attend school, so yes I'd say they're adults
<CharlesAppleJackson> Ghosties! What the motherfuck is up motherfucker>
<Lordlyhour> Or, in this case, a race of horses
<Nyst> I mean, Two of them have real jobs.
<Whizz_Bang> the mane cast are physically young adults, mentally tweens/young teens
<Ghosties> 4Sorry for being so late, I decided to take my mom's offer up on eating out
<Alyure> OKI DOKI LOKI
<Ghosties> 4But what did Daz want?
<Lucid> Well, it IS trollestia that sent them
<ValtheJean> s'all good brony :P
<Monkey_Zombie> I think their in the early 20's personally
<Lordlyhour> So?
<PurpleDoom> QUICK! where are the measuring cups in my kitchen?
<ValtheJean> dunno, he was just asking if you'd be here
<Silverscreen> 11We should make a special announcement that the Lottery takes place tomorrow, to get more people to show up.
<Ghosties> 4@CAJ: Not much, motherfucker
<RAWRity> monkey_zombies actually most "gods" in mythology aren't omniscient or omnipotent, just look at the greek and roman pantheons
<Nyst> So in human terms they'd be twenty-somethings?
<ninjapwny> so...they're our age?
<Lordlyhour> They've obviously got a very different culture to us
<Wrek> 06and fluttershy is 1 year older than pinkie
<InsertCupcake> between 20-28 equivalents i reckon
<Sidworth> impling the omnipotence or omniscience is a requirement for godhood
<Luna> 07sure
<Lucid> Well, that depends on how old you are
<Spin> PurpleDoom:check the drawer to yourleft
<Ghosties> 4When did we do the lottery last week?
<PurpleDoom> gee, thanks for the cooking help guys :.
*ValtheJean 2,14 loves this vid
<sotha> Koyaanisqatsi
<PurpleDoom> thanks spin 1 sec
<ninjapwny> ALL HAIL FLUTTERSHY
<Dman> Ohai ghosties
<Lordlyhour> Humans need to give their kids about 4 years of constat care before they can walk
<Madfish> 'Pinkie and the Chocolate Factory
<PurpleDoom> nah spin, sharp knives
<Lordlyhour> Foals are Born able to walk

<Purple`Prose> how appropriate
<Ghosties> 4That's fine. It was supposed to be Friday, so, this week is still on schedule
<Lordlyhour> Ponies Obviously need much less coddling from their Parents
<Dark_Heart> FORSHADOW
<Monkey_Zombie> Well Luna is controlling a large mass all by herself why is she not as big as her sister or for that matter larger than any of the other ponies.
<ninjapwny> esp considering the movie tonite
<Lucid> Indeed
<Nyst> That would explain why applebloom can learn of advanced subjects at such an early age.
<Ghosties> 4Hello, Dman
<sotha> Oh my Foreshadowing for tonight!
<Lordlyhour> hence, they're able to take on Jobs much earlier

<Silverscreen> 11Nah, Pinky is Freakazoid.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 let me grab that image dari!
<prince-dari> ValtheJean: TALLY-HO!
<EspyLacopa> Pinky is too obvious to be Freakazoid.
<Lucid> Let's see. TS is into classical, AJ is country, obviously. I'd have to say that Rainbow Dash likes rap, dunno why
<Wrek> 05>pinkazoid
<mib_o9f73i> 0Oh colors are for mods.. ._.

<ValtheJean> 2,14 Dari: http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/Preview.jpg

<Octavia> 14Hey PurpleDoom lol
<Daz> I was keeping you from this music, Ghosties? Ah, sorry to hear it.
<Dashite> We have a pwny and a ninjapwny.
<Lucid> What would Ditzy listen to?
<Silverscreen> 11Why did we decline him?
<Octavia> 14Inrite Ghosties?
<ninjapwny> pwny, there can be ONLY ONE
<RAWRity> lucid I think Rarity would be into early 1900's music, the era with big operatic stage shows
<EspyLacopa> Yay, hub showing Winter Wrap-up in 9 minutes
<Razyn> 0Not much, Daz. Just hanging and banging.
<Spin> I'm more like Fluttershy when I'm at home but I'm like RD when in a social setting
<Dashite> Now we need a piratepwny
<FndF> Video name?
<pwny> And that one is me
*ninjapwny draws claymore
<pwny> BAM
<french> Wht is the song called?
<Daz> nice, Razyn. I'm chillin' myself.
<Rezo> Rarity is totally into 80s pop
<EspyLacopa> Rainbow Dash listening to Opera music.
<Lucid> Yeah, probably. We need to start making a list
<Wrek> 05ugh all of these random "white" messages
<pwny> My brother works for steam, you're gonna get banhammered lol
<pwny> hahahahah for real though
<Silverscreen> 11EspyLacopa: Only if that Opera is Repo!
<Daz> y u cring? y u mad thou?
<Pinchy> derp
<mib_o9f73i> 0i like the Friendship isnt available in your country..
<ValtheJean> we could add that to the rules
<Daz> also, I LOVE this PMV!
<pwny> this chat room is plenty big enough for both of us
<Lucid> Love this song
<Turtaguin> YAYAYAYAYAY
<Spin> Still can't get over the voice
<Octavia> 14Well, least he was fine with it. I figured he'd be pretty upset since he was so set on it.
<TwilightSparkle> YES!
<EspyLacopa> Silverscreen: Flight of the Valkyries.
<Octavia> 14Goooooood song
<Applejack> :3
<RAWRity> We need to make a project for creating the Mane 6 FB pages
<Lordlyhour> Well, Ima go to Reuploading is magic and watch me some GGG
<Silverscreen> 11Or that.
<Lordlyhour> because i still haven't seen the last episode
<Pinchy> hey, that's a nice vid
<mib_o9f73i> 0*becomes a mod just to get a fancy color*
*EspyLacopa got idea from reading Pony of the Opera.
<Lordlyhour> WWHAT SORT OF PATHETIC BRONY AM I?
<Lucid> Wait, I go back on what I said earlier. RD would listen to 80's power metal. If not that, then glam metal
<Silverscreen> 11RAWRity: Good luck. FB has been hellbent against Pony FB pages.
<Nyst> Rainbow Dash has the best voice.
<Spin> 13Oh ya
<anon> i think TS would like atmospheric music
<RAWRity> This is pretty much the only song I like off of "Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace"
<anon> stuff you can do other things to
<Pinchy> Lordlyhour: you're not alone
<DerpyHooves> Someone mind linking me to this video?
<pwny> Up until two seconds ago, I thought brony was spelt with an ie at the end
<Spin> 0oh oka
<ValtheJean> 2,14 indeed silver. they just went through another crusade the other day
<pwny> true story
<Luna> 07Ghost
<Luna> 07bees up next
<ninjapwny> it can be
<PurpleDoom> Rainbow crash? nyst.... Fluttershy is where it is at you foal.
<Octavia> 14No colors Spin :P
<pwny> is brony like bro and pony combined?
<Spin> 0Ya just found out from the scary red text
<PurpleDoom> yes
<anon> my friends say I have a cancer
<pwny> if so, can a girl be a brony?
<Lordlyhour> Reuploading is magic
<PrincePolo> yup
<pwny> or is that just lame?
<Lucid> I think that Flutterguy would listen to Hip-hop
<Nyst> Brony is gender neutral.
<PurpleDoom> Girls are pega-sisters
<Lordlyhour> Its a youtube channel where they be reuploading pony
<DerpyHooves> I'm a brony pwny and I'm a girl
<Lucid> Yes, that would make her a pegesis
<Lordlyhour> *happydance*
<pwny> pegasisters?
<Ghosties> 4@Silver: We declined him because of some stuff
<Luna> 07welcome to the club ;)
<pwny> that sounds much prettier
<PurpleDoom> pega-sisters, yes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it was initially /b/rony because of our origins, but since then brony has become unisex
<Spin> 0Brony is unisex replacing or splitting into genders kinda ruins the unity that it gives us bronies
<DerpyHooves> pegasisters? Never heard that one :)
<Ghosties> 4I can't think of the best way to put it
<MrPoniator> Hey-o
<Wrek> 05ive heard quite a few, Bronettes for one.
<Pinchy> oh yeah, this video is blazing awesome
<Daz> Octavia, there's an autokick so no need to tell people 'no colours' anymore :3
<RAWRity> pwny the jury is sort of out on that. Some consider "Brony" gender Neutral, others use "Pegasis/Pegasister"
<Wrek> 05but brony suits all
<MeteorVenture> what spin said
<Octavia> 14I just call everypony Brony :P
<anon> pegasis
<Silverscreen> 11k
<pwny> my bro is right next to me on his pc
<anon> pegasus + sis
<Ghosties> 4Basically, he was complaining about Breeze getting mod position over him
<Silverscreen> 11Just curious.
<Nyst> It's the same way Bro's are necessarily brothers.
<Dashite> YES
<Pinchy> >pegasis
<ninjapwny> besides, there are no girls on the internet

<prince-dari> In the request channel.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, it's a Bjornfot thing I suppose
<prince-dari> #bronystaterequests
<CharlesAppleJackson> Ghosties or maybe even Amurrica
<Lucid> I gave that ghostie a hug. Ghosties love hugs
<Daz> bjornfort * FTFY
<Wrek> 05you know the port prince-dari?
<Ghosties> 4THIS IS FOR AMERICA

<Lordlyhour> So, given everything is pnified,
<prince-dari> Port for what?
<MirrorImage> oh god that Applebloom voice
*Silverscreen 11is fat.
<Apokalipse> Bjornfort is best fort

<Wrek> 05yeah
*Lucid is fat as well
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Lordlyhour> I demand australia to instead be Crocified
<Cyril> oh man, the problem I have with this song is how anachronistic that verse is
<prince-dari> 6667
<Turtaguin> Whats a good b movie?
<prince-dari> 6668
<Bjornfot> Bjornfot is a name who strikes fear into everyone who has ever watched a Brony Movie Night.
<Cyril> THAT is the only thing I have it
<Wrek> 05my router is very restrictive
*Apokalipse isn't fat
<Cyril> *have issue with
<Lordlyhour> an entire Continent of Crocdiles
<NightLight> mysterious as the dark side of the moon!
<prince-dari> And 8074 I think.
<prince-dari> Let me check.
<Lordlyhour> ALL STEREOTYPICALL ACCENTED TOO!
<NightLight> what?
<Daz> Turtaguin: Spiderweb something something
<Applejack> Applebloom is here?
<Spin> 0whats Bjornfot?
<redneckasian> Austrailia is a continent of death
<Daz> trolo
<Ghosties> 4@Bjornfot: Not really, you're like the resident Nord. And nords rock in my book
<Lucid> Australia, the country where everything is trying to kill you
*Applejack seraches for Applebloom
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Turtaguin: usually a cult film or an incredibly bad (that it's funny) movie, but that isn't an all inclusive list
<Lordlyhour> Frikken Caps
<Applejack> searches*
<EspyLacopa> Incoming infinite birdnest. . .
<Daz> now Applebloom, don't watch our movies today.
<Lucid> Australia needs moar ponies
<Turtaguin> k!
<Turtaguin> thanks!
<Silverscreen> 11Turtaguin: Read the rules.
<Ayralynn> I'm pretty sure Tacowiz strikes fear into everyone
<Silverscreen> 11It's at the bottom of the page.
<Lordlyhour> Ponies?
<Ghosties> 4Tacowiz is the Public Enemy
<EspyLacopa> Australia: Where nearly everything is trying to kill you.
<Lucid> Wait, Applebloom is in here?
<Apokalipse> TACOWIZ? No... not to be mentioned
<Daz> Ayralynn, imo Bjornfot strikes more Fear D:
<Bjornfot> Ghosties: >implying Nords doesn't strike fear into the hearts of everyone in a 12km radius
<Aponymous> TACOWIZ!
<Wrek> 05(also TCP or UDP)
<prince-dari> Oh
<prince-dari> 7029
<PurpleDoom> I would like to clarify. I am a colt, not a filly. Cooked food is just better than frozen dinners.
<CharlesAppleJackson> Hey Ghosties! Tacowiz is my best friend! How dare you say that about him!
<NightLight> oh gosh I haven't laughed as hard as I did at the entire continent of crocodiles thing in a while
<Lordlyhour> Serieously, Only Dash, AJ, Twiligh, Pinke and FLuttershy could Survive in Australia!
<NightLight> thanks for that
<CharlesAppleJackson> /sarcasm
<prince-dari> I dunno, on my router I just put both I think.
<Ghosties> 4@Bjornfot: Maybe...but Nords kick ass regardless
*Applejack is pleased
<MirrorImage> PUrpleDoom: i agree but frozen dinners are just SO convenient
<Wrek> 05okie
<Alyure> I was just singing that entire song xD
<Daz> OBEY
<anon> when does this start
<Wrek> 05will probably DC real quick
<anon> the main thing
<Ghosties> 4@CAJ: And?
<Lucid> HEy Espylacopa, you added an extra "Nearly"
<Lordlyhour> And Rarity,'cause she'd just get rich on Opals and Pink diamonds
<Spin> 0PurpleDoom coltiest colt of the cooking colt variety

<RainbowDashBrony> XP was probably and still is best windows?
<prince-dari> Are we gunna have any other servers.
<Arcus> It is a liquor made by freeze distilling hard cider
*Lucid sits next to Applejack, preparing for the movie
<Applejack> Arcus: Drinking mahself? That ain't healthy...
<RainbowDashBrony> in my opinion it is
<prince-dari> Or should I just set up with mibbit now.
<Spin> 0I imagine gilda without any feathers and just bits of fur and Talons and only her lion features

<Silverscreen> 11RDLover: No colors.
<Frubban> Indeed.
<ValtheJean> for the shows?
<TheLobe> ME is best windows
