<trollghost> sup
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: umm why you do that mate v
<Ponies47> Hey trollghost
<AdamTheDuck> Hello there trollghost
<trollghost> guys, i been thinking
<scottish-geeky> trollghost: ello mate
<Wrek> 05heres to hopign for competent team members
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: It's caleld punishment. I was a bad pony :(
<Ponies47> *called
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: I grew up in arcades, so I'm much better at action games :D
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: how wer u bad lad
<trollghost> and in 2 episodes of mlp, rarity says "rainbow wont look like a tank" and rainbows pet is called tank
<scottish-geeky> trollghost: and
<Ponies47> scottish-geeky: Remeber the tomato throwing
<trollghost> so if they know the word tank, then maybe there was a war between humans and ponies?
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: well, rts are not my favourite genre, but seeing how red alert 2 was the first thing i seriously played, it's one of them^^
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: ahh .....
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 Adventure Time metaphor
<scottish-geeky> inb4 DERRRP
<trollghost> and ponies far in our future were geneticfally engineered to do magic for us and be self aware
<Ponies47> Anyways it's almost 3:00 AM time for bed. Night everypony :)
<scottish-geeky> i still dont get the inb4 thing
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Ponies47
<trollghost> then they fought back against us, won because you know, magic, and populated the world with happiness and friendship!
<scottish-geeky> Ponies47: night mate sleep well may luna gard your slumber
<AdamTheDuck> trollghost, reminds me of a fanfic called Anthropology
<AdamTheDuck> just minus the fighting
<trollghost> also, does pony world (not just equestria) have time zones?
<scottish-geeky> well im head of as well nitie evry pony
<AdamTheDuck> Night scottish-geeky
<scottish-geeky> nithe AdamTheDuck
<trollghost> and if there are more regions than equestria, do they each have there own princess's that raise a localized moon and sun to fit their time zones?
<trollghost> we need an mlp episode that explains this kind of important stuff.
<AdamTheDuck> trollghost, Celestia's reign is a monarchy
<AdamTheDuck> FOR LUNA
*AdamTheDuck salutes!
<Moopy> im going to lay down on my red bean bag and watch the stream and the chat now
<trollghost> AdamTheDuck how is it a monarchy if she lives and reigns essentially forever?
<AdamTheDuck> Wait... isn't a monarchy when there is only one leader?
<trollghost> well AdamTheDuck thats a good question
<Panda|sleepies> inb4 oligarchy?
<trollghost> a dictatorship is a "political" method of someone ruling a country or province by there own,
<trollghost> while a monarchy is a "religous" method of someone ruling a country or province by blood, e.g. our rolyal family (even though they have little to no control over the country now)
<AdamTheDuck> Ahhhhhhhhh I see
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<trollghost> but still, in the royal family there is a dictator (the king/quenn [usually king])
<Jmo> MUTINY
<trollghost> all of the uks king and queens have been, to say the least, crap
<trollghost> and thats why parliment will always be better
<AdamTheDuck> Reminds me of the time when I wiki'd anarchy to find how the anarchy symbol had anything to do with anarchy and scrolled down to a section that had "Leaders of anarchy groups".
<AdamTheDuck> And I was thinking: wait a second...
<AdamTheDuck> Isn't anarchy supposed to have no leaders? 6_9
<trollghost> well
<trollghost> anarchy and anonymous are 2 different things woven together
<trollghost> anarchy is just messing shit up all through time
<trollghost> and anonymous (which started as a troll that succeded on /b/) is a group that messes shit up through anarchy
<AdamTheDuck> I still haven't got a clue why that 'A' is the symbol for anarchy. :3
<JRP> SuperBrony64: is a fridge
<Ponies47> So yeah good night wubs and all that other (squee)
<AdamTheDuck> Aren't you asleep yet Ponies47 ?
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: I never fall asleep right away! :D
<Jmo> Ain't no sleep for the wicked.
<AdamTheDuck> Munay don't grow on trees
<AdamTheDuck> I got bills to pay
<AdamTheDuck> Got mouths to feed and ain't nothing in this world comes free
<trollghost> i got crowds to please
<Jmo> Gold star for AdamTheDuck.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh well you can't stop now, you can't hold back although you know I wish I could
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, what was next?...

<AdamTheDuck> And you said you use Live?
<Jmo> Mhmm
<AdamTheDuck> Because therainbowvortex couldn't sign up with his/her live but you still managed I'm assuming :?
<AdamTheDuck> :/*
<Jmo> Several things: His email could of been entered incorrectly, his email is already registered or the website was being an arse at the time.
<Jmo> Other then that I would have no idea.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Jmo> He would have to contact Knighty or someone else.
<therainbowvortex> im so geting pissed off i just tried to register again but would it let me noo
<AdamTheDuck> Well what does it say?
<Jmo> What exactly is the issue you're having during registration?
<Jmo> Are you not entering something correctly? A field is empty and requires filling?
<therainbowvortex> my email it says its wrong but i cheeked it it corect
<AdamTheDuck> Is this during registration on Fimfiction?
<AdamTheDuck> or on Gmail?
<therainbowvortex> yes
<therainbowvortex> fimfiction
<AdamTheDuck> What does the sign up exactly say? "The email you entered is incorrect"?
<AdamTheDuck> or something similar to that
<therainbowvortex> it has an x next to my email name
<therainbowvortex> mabby its my compter
<Jmo> Are you trying to enter your email into the username field? <_>
<AdamTheDuck> Most likely not.
<therainbowvortex> nope
<AdamTheDuck> maybe just copy+paste your email across
<therainbowvortex> ill try that
<AdamTheDuck> that way there will not be any error in spelling from when you log on your gmail
<AdamTheDuck> I still have no idea what language wrek's songs are in :D
<therainbowvortex> adamtheduck i dont have a gmail i couldent figer out how to sing up

<Kandarihu> MASF123, Phantasy Star Online 2
<MASF123> People still play that? :O
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodmorning MASF123
<Kandarihu> MASF123, what is that supposed to mean?

<MASF123> Hi MLP_Brovakiin

*Kandarihu asked MASF123 what he meant, then made a presumption himself.
<Kandarihu> Sorry
<Cypresswolf> Malk: :) I'm doing alright - getting ready for...something

<Sumica> 00,10sorry

<AdamTheDuck> Wow, dem spies
<Buytoast> welp, my connection cut out
<Buytoast> good luck
<flutter_spin> heh. FlimFlam
<alexxm> hehe
<Sumica> 00,10welcome to my world
<MASF123> Sumica the chat is your world
<MASF123> With all the other mods as the rulers
<Sumica> 00,10no the world of cant play MvM with friends cause game crashed
<MASF123> I didn't quite understand that comment but ok. :)
<Cypresswolf> Im heading out - not sure how long this will last
<AdamTheDuck> Bye cy - :| why do they always leave before I get to say goodbye
<DashWithRainbows> Sumica Meanwhile is having graphic lag, only me and Phase4 now with some randoms
<MASF123> The day I get a life is when I'll stop coming to this chat.
<MASF123> I'm on this everyday.
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Meanwhile> It's just not plausible to play properly like that.
<AdamTheDuck> Who needs a life when you have ponies :P
<Meanwhile> I turn so slow that spies in front me can move around me.
<flutter_spin> I got a new computer. The day I got it, my brother says "well he isn't going to have a life"
<MLP_Brovakiin> MASF123: So true, I have been on this everydey this holiday :| I need a life
<MASF123> AdamTheDuck, ponies don't pay the bills.
<MLP_Brovakiin> *everyday
<MASF123> Lol. flutter_spin. Yeah I heard you MLP_Bronykiin
<MadSurge> Hello flutter_spin! :)
<flutter_spin> hey. I got like 15min
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 Phase4 rage quits
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<flutter_spin> Wait, does wave 7 just keep going on and on?
<AdamTheDuck> flutter_spin, No they just keep losing :/
<DashWithRainbows> It's bloody hard.
<flutter_spin> I mean, does it restart or do you keep playing until you win?
<AdamTheDuck> flutter_spin, Until you win or rage quit
<DashWithRainbows> you keep playing until you win
<DashWithRainbows> or everyone quits
<AdamTheDuck> Dat troll engy
<flutter_spin> DashWithRainbows: I know its hard... insanely hard. I tried playing myself. Not fun being a sniper when you have no weapons unlocked (or any other class)
<DashWithRainbows> ... Yeah, stock weapons aren't entirely good for MvM
<DashWithRainbows> Only a few are good
<flutter_spin> It is sadly true.
<DashWithRainbows> Like heavies minigun and flamethrower (airblast cost)
<flutter_spin> I'm like "why bother if I can't beat it with standard weapons"
<flutter_spin> Honestly, I think it would be better to win with very little reward than to lose in trying for a large reward
<flutter_spin> Just the satisfaction of saying you won.
<flutter_spin> I see Pony
<flutter_spin> lol
<flutter_spin> And I thought chat died more during the night. Feels like no one on right now
<MLP_Brovakiin> flutter_spin: Most people are at work now or back to school now
<flutter_spin> My bro looked up Guild Wars 2 classes. I think he really wants to play it
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I'm about to go to work here soon too
<AdamTheDuck> So... much... maths homework... :|
<AdamTheDuck> last question yay
<flutter_spin> eh. I slept through my Calculus class. Math was easy for me.
<AdamTheDuck> Not when you're doing year 11 maths in year 10 :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> AdamTheDuck: My teacher makes us do that
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 Phase4 flips his table
<Phase4> yeah
<Phase4> i'm about to rage
<Buytoast> at the match or the guy talking constantly?
<AdamTheDuck> Most likely the match
<Sumica> 00,10it just depends on the class flutter_spin
<Sumica> 00,10you can do fine with any of the wepons
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03He moves away from the mic to breathe in.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03CHOCALATE RAIN!
<flutter_spin> Sumica: well like he said "I hate being tank. No way I'm being guardian"
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Scoot-Scootaloo
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodmorning Scoot-Scootaloo
<AdamTheDuck> and hai there :)
<flutter_spin> He's thinking Elementalist. Also, we are playing together. We have to consider co-op abilities
<Sumica> 00,10and realy every tf2 item is just a trade off.
<Sumica> 00,10sniper can get jar for mini crits and slow but you lose a damage weapon
<flutter_spin> I dont think you would be spy for a weapon :P
<flutter_spin> I mean sniper. I'm rushing out the door
<AdamTheDuck> Yay maths is done
<AdamTheDuck> and goodnight BronyState!
<AdamTheDuck> I'm beat.
<Phase4> night AdamTheDuck
<DashWithRainbows> Ugh, this is annoying.
<DashWithRainbows> At least I know how to do a credit glitch now :P
<DashWithRainbows> It'll make me OP at the beginning of MvM games.
<Phase4> so
<DashWithRainbows> Anyways, I'll be on later. T'was fun to play with you Phase4, Sumica, Buytoast and Meanwhile.
<Phase4> at least it doesnt consume tickets to fail
<Phase4> otherwise that would have been a really expencive few hours
<killerpony7733> Dat silence?
<killerpony7733> over 10 minutes of silence
<alexxm> welp somethings odd
<killerpony7733> No sound?
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> Profesor Oak

<Reikim> So Meanwhile, what's this whole home world thing? Which server should I choose?
<Alchemist> is someone playing FO3 again?
<Kothen> Is that the guy from one of the abridged series?
*Meanwhile dribbles a bit.
<Alchemist> oh, nevermind

<Vordox> Reminds me of an abridged person, aye
<Reikim> ...Well that doesn't look too good.

<Meanwhile> Uhhuh.

<trollghost> huh... well anyway 2 days until doctor who :]
<panda> There is a new dr who episode?
<mitamaking> I just realized it is spelled Mane in Mane chat
<Pearly> it starts in 2 days
<mitamaking> I am slow
<Sumica> 00,10that would explane the 15 hr marathon on BBC:A
<panda> I need to catch up, ive only watched 4 episodes thus far xD
<Ponies47> Back and I am shocked! My brother did something for my pets for once! :O
<Ponies47> I need to start getting into Doctor Who ;_;
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Ponies47 :)
<Ponies47> Thanks MLP_Brovakiin
<panda> Ponies ponies ponies swag :)
<Sumica> 00,10Not a fan of what's his arse
<mitamaking> Ponies47: Mentioned while my parents start watching a Sylvester McCoy story arc
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Hotdiggedydemon?
<Ponies47> mitamaking: I see.
<Panda> I didnt know his arse had a name Sumica
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Eyemeralds?
<Sumica> 00,10the one that thinks fezes and bowties are cool.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, that one doctor.
<Panda> D: but i like bowties.
*Pearly hops around the room
<mitamaking> The current one?
<mitamaking> Fezes and bowties are cool anyway
<Sumica> 00,10they may be but that doctor is not
<mitamaking> I have only seen like the first 5 with him, he seemed fine
<Jmo> I SMELL DOCTOR WHO DISCUSSION
<Moopy> ewwwwww
<mitamaking> You have a cool computer there, able to smell discussions
<Panda> Moopy..... you be eww....
<Panda> ^-^
<mitamaking> what does it smell like
<Ponies47> I wonder if I have BBC
<Moopy> so what
<Jmo> Season 7, so close yet so far.
<Jmo> ;~;
*Panda sniffs Moopy
<Ponies47> I wanna start watching Doctor Who I heard it's really good.
<Panda> Yup moopy poopy!
<Moopy> ewww get away from me
<Ponies47> Ohai Wrek stream
<Panda> You know im joking with you, right Moopy?
<Moopy> oooo paint programs i love piant programs
<Moopy> yeah
<Jmo> Paint Tool SAI for life.
<mitamaking> Wrek time
<MadSurge> Wrek! :)
<mitamaking> Doctor Who is good, just pick a doctor and start with him
<Ponies47> Twilight Sniper! :3
<mitamaking> Magic would make sniping too easy, I mean unlimited zoom in and a bullet that could move
<Panda> ^
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> magic bulletproofness
<Panda> Which is why twi is OP
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> your logic is invalid
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> plus there are no guns in questria
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so again, logic invalid
<mitamaking> SeaponiesofLiverpool: I think she is sniping Earthponies and Pegasi, why turn on the great unicorn race
<Panda> There are guns in Wrekquestria.....
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> pegasi have thunderclouds for sniping as Derpy proved
<mitamaking> SeaponiesofLiverpool: If there are no gun in Equestria, how did Pinkie know how to use Twillight like one?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> when she nearly assassinated Dash
<MLP_Brovakiin> dat benny hill :D
<Panda> mitamaking thats a good point.
<RaveBrony> :O
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> its just they have different weapons
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> magic laser weapons.... yes... Lightning guns ... yes
<RaveBrony> Gotta love th4 benny hill theme
<Ponies47> Benny Hill Theme :P
<RaveBrony> *the
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> gunpowder..... probably not
*Ponies47 Runs around the chat
<mitamaking> A lightning gun is still a gun
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> ponies probably don't use gunpowder
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> as a weapon
<Panda> They use bone power then?
<mitamaking> They don't really need it, again magic
*RaveBrony starts chasing pretty woman around his apartment complex
<RaveBrony> *women
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> *mares
<Moopy> oh no the sea ponies name oh dear god
<RaveBrony> Poor Benny Hill never got the ladies :D
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> *mares
<Panda> Shoobedoo shoo shoo be do
<Ponies47> Sho be do shoo shoo be do
<Panda> Call upon the C pwnies when you're in distress.
<Ponies47> Whoa!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Springtime for Hoofler & Germaneigh
<RaveBrony> I dont chase 'mares' in a pervy way :D I chase Women!
<Panda> RaveBrony mares are better :3
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> so D-war is tomorrow... the news is a bit confusing
<RaveBrony> That theme is going to be stuck in my head all day damn it...
<Ponies47> My OC is a staillion but most of pictures I have of him are R63
<RaveBrony> Panda: Pfffft ;)
<mitamaking> Am I the only person who doesn't find Benny Hill funny
<kirzstryfe> Ponies47, I think Sumica has the same issue lol
<Sumica> 00,10I have no idea what you could posably meen
<Moopy> Oh hey superbrony64 you there dude
<Ponies47> kirzstryfe: Ohai you. I doesn't really bug me. To be honest if I we're a pony I wouldn't mind being a mare :$
<kirzstryfe> just saying, there are a lot of male Sumica pictures, and that's just wrong for your OC
<Panda> kirzstryfe ^-^ you live!
<RaveBrony> Ive been working on a pic of my OC for so long :'(
<MLP_Brovakiin> RaveBrony: I have not got one :P
<Ponies47> The only picture of my OC that is not R63 is a picture of him as a young little colt
<RaveBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: Get onee! :o
<MLP_Brovakiin> RaveBrony: Meh I can't draw for shit, and I don't really want to ask for one :(
<Ponies47> I used pony maker to make my OC as a young little colt
<MLP_Brovakiin> And I don't know any other way to get an OC :P
<RaveBrony> MLP_Brovakiin: Just draw what you can! :)
<AJIsAwesome> I used Pony Maker as a rough draft, then I change and edit it based on the model I made.
<Ponies47> Huzzah! I do have BBC! :3
<pyrocatboy> Sometime in the future Wrek should just draw some guns because I love his attention to detail.
<pony_4071> anyone there
<pony_4071> ?
<Ponies47> Oh yeah. I have to go to the dentist today ;_;
<Ponies47> Yes we are pony_4071 we are just hiding
<pony_4071> D: dont hide from me i need friends
<mitamaking> Does everyone have an oc?
<Ponies47> mitamaking: I do
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yay I am making my OC right as we speak :)

<GigabitHarmonie> Ponies47: I'd be interested in hearing what specs you are looking at!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I bought the printer
<GigabitHarmonie> CrazyCherry: Hello hello! :) How are you today?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you can send your models to shapeways and they will print them for you
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but for the price of printers these days… its pretty affordable and plastic is cheap
<Malk> Q
<CrazyCherry> GigabitHarmonie: I'm doing good. A little tired though. :/ And do I know you? :D
<prince-dari> How much was the printer?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> $600
*Pearly hugs CrazyCherry "it's ok"
<prince-dari> Huh, that's less than I was expecting. O_o
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> www.solidoodle.com
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> theres a huge lead time though
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 12 weeks id estimate
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> thats my forum above, if you want to join, its dedicated to solidoodle 3d printing.
<GigabitHarmonie> CrazyCherry: Not sure you do, but it's always nice to meet new ponies!
*Spyrorocks[Laptop] prints ponies, hasbro goes broke
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hahaha lol
<GigabitHarmonie> Oh, and Pearly! You as well!
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Undercut them
<prince-dari> :P
*CrazyCherry noms on GigabitHarmonie's ear. :3
<tSparx> Guten Tag, everypony!
<GigabitHarmonie> Oh! My ear!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have a feeling 3d printing will shake up the whole toy industry
<Malk> Howdy tSparx
<Pearly> GigabitHarmonie, thank you very much :D
<GigabitHarmonie> Ah, Guten Tag tSparx. Wie gehts?
<MadSurge> CrazyCherry: are you here saturday nights after european movie night?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Albums: Warfilly / Hell Muffins / Nocturne of the Firmaments / The Science of Friendship / Epic Final Bosses / Let's Buck Sh** Up
<WallDives> also, hi GigabitHarmonie.
<prince-dari> What sort of materials can you current use them for, just plastics?
<WallDives> and dat MADSURGE.
<GigabitHarmonie> Hello WallDives! :)
<Ponies47> GigabitHarmonie: It's a desktop that's for sure. What it's goign to have not exactly sure yet (Not much of a computer expert :$) My mom is taking me but my dad wants to tag along to help out (I want him to because the last computer my mom bought (My brother's laptop) she purchased one with AWFUL speakers). So I'm pretty sure the next time you see me I'll most likely be on my new one.
<CrazyCherry> MadSurge: Sometimes. :3
<Ponies47> Dat wall of text :$
<tSparx> GigabitHarmonie: Ich bin ko, und dir?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Well for my cheapo $600 printer, it uses ABS plastic
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> aka the same stuff legos are made out of
<GigabitHarmonie> Ponies47: Well, I'm a technology specialist, so I'd be able to tell you what you're getting and whether it's a good deal, in the least.
<prince-dari> Ahh, cool
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> or you can use PLA, which is a natural biodegradable plastic made from corn startch
<MadSurge> CrazyCherry: GigabitHarmonie does the podcasts with Allegr0
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I prefer abs though because it doesnt melt if it gets wet and gives you better quality prints.
<CrazyCherry> MadSurge: Oh. :3
<Ponies47> GigabitHarmonie: My dad is a computer expert. He would know what is good and what is not.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But for the more expensive printers
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> like $50k and up
*Pearly snuggles with GigabitHarmonie
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> they can use up to 50 different types of materials
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and combine them to make analogs and stuff
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its crazy.
<prince-dari> Hah, damn
<tSparx> I'm not used to associating T-Sparx with guns when Pinkie's not around.
<Pearly> Ponies47, I do too..
<Pearly> my computer is almost 4
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://www.soliforum.com/topic/63/brads-solidoodle-unboxing/
<Ponies47> Pearly: My computer is 9 years old -_-
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> theres my unboxing video if you want to see what the printers look like
<GigabitHarmonie> tSparx: Gut, vielen Dank! Was hast du heute gemacht?
<Pearly> wow
<Ponies47> Also I'm gonna go DOUBLE monitor with this one :3
<JunkerKun> Hey, I have a laptop that is... um... I don't know how old it is
<Pearly> I can for this one too if I wanted to
<mitamaking> Cookie Monster?
<GigabitHarmonie> Ponies47: Of course, wonderful! I didn't mean to discount your father at all. :)
<Pearly> but would be a dvi monitor
<prince-dari> What are the dimensions of the printing area?
*CrazyCherry hugs GigabitHarmonie. "Nice to meet you. I herd you're the one getting the aftermovie things up. :3
<MadSurge> GigabitHarmonie: would love to hear you speak german :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 6 inches x 6 inches x 6 inches
<tSparx|Hwk> GigabitHarmonie: Unterricht, und... das ist es xD
<prince-dari> That's a pretty good size
*GigabitHarmonie hugs pearly and CrazyCherry gently. "Very nice to meet you both, I am a small part of the site doing the podcast and then an occasional radio show."
<mitamaking> What does xD mean in German?
<CrazyCherry> GigabitHarmonie: Yay. :3
<tSparx|Hwk> mitamaking: The same thing it means in English... it's a smiley xD
<mitamaking> Is it an angry smiley?
<prince-dari> Also, I didn't know you liked mlp
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Just got into it hahahaha
<prince-dari> Ah that's cool. <:
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ive got no shame in saying its one of the very few rare gems of current animated cartoons.
<GigabitHarmonie> tSparx|Hwk: Ah, wirklich? Schüler oder Lehrer?
<Pearly> OOOO pidcast, I so miss doing that
<Ponies47> GigabitHarmonie: Oh I'm not offended at all. Don't worry. I think my brother is goign to need a new computer soon as well. The laptop he has right now (Which is the one my mom purchased) is starting to act up. For example. I won't update freakin Adobe Flash Player and I have to use that sometimes when I'm at my dad's so I can't really go on the chat when I'm on that computer. -_-
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 99.9% of TV is absolute garbage.
<Ponies47> *going
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I wouldn't want my kids watching most of the "childrens" shows they have on these days.
<Ponies47> What is with me and walls of text today!?! D:
<GigabitHarmonie> mitamaking: Reminds me of the French video on youtube that had the top comment, "Why are they laughing in English?!"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> The twilight sparkle print is about 4 inches high
<mitamaking> GigabitHarmonie: rolling on the floor laughing
<RainbowDash90> RRRRAAAWWWEEEEEERRR!!!!!! :D
<GigabitHarmonie> RainbowDash90: !
<tSparx|Hwk> GigabitHarmonie: Schoolwork, all for my Theo class this afternoon.
<GigabitHarmonie> tSparx|Hwk: Ah. :)
<prince-dari> You gunna try and paint it?
<mitamaking> Theology?>
*CrazyCherry nuzzles GigabitHarmonie. "It's been a good bit of time since I've last been here. :#"
<mitamaking> *Theology?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<prince-dari> Have you made a Dash yet? :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Gotta get the right acrylic paints though in the right colours
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ill do a dash tonight
<Wrek> 05hows that?
<MadSurge> CrazyCherry: Ikr? Where have you been?
<tSparx|Hwk> mitamaking: Yep yep. One of my majors :)
<prince-dari> Hahaha, sweet
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> dash has more pieces though so it should take longer
<MadSurge> Wrek: FUCK. YEEAAAAAAHHHHH!
<mitamaking> The squares are easy to notice
<tSparx|Hwk> Ooh, I do enjoy typing in smileys and getting ponies :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> If you want one ill make you one and send it to you.
<CrazyCherry> MadSurge: Not here. XD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> They dont cost very much to make.
<mitamaking> >_><_< <---when did these get added?
<Ponies47> Wrek: So awesome! /)^3^(\
<prince-dari> That would be brilliant, thanks
<Ponies47> mitamaking: Few weeks ago
<tSparx|Hwk> Firefox is acting janky today, which means I'm gonna have to restart my comp, but that's a big pain on my system for reasons I don't fully understand.
<tSparx|Hwk> So I'm on Chrome right now, using the embed client, which means I get to enjoy this --> :)
<GigabitHarmonie> Just so you know, I can say that you will love the next [insert_genre_here] music hour! :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I just dont have a rarity model yet
<mitamaking> , Trixie, and Sweetiebelle
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the mane is screwing up my printer
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> too many thin walls
<prince-dari> Ahh
<mitamaking> Plus Derpy, Trixie, and Swetiebelle
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> when it does work, im going to have to glue together like 10 pieces
<mitamaking> that was weird
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> not really a big deal though.
<MASF123> ...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Dash has I think… 5 or 6 pieces
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> twilight had 4
<MASF123> Damn laptop Derping like crazy...
<CrazyCherry> GigabitHarmonie: Okie.
<CrazyCherry> :3
<MASF123> Maybe it's the 18 GBs of Derpy pic I saved up on this 6gb laptop. :P
<GigabitHarmonie> MASF123: It just doesn't know what went wrong.
<MASF123> pics
<GigabitHarmonie> 18Gbs on a 6Gb laptop?
<Panda> MASF123 xD only with derpy that is possible
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> are you in US or UK? I forgot
<GigabitHarmonie> Where did the other 12Gb get stored?
<GigabitHarmonie> Derpy flew north for the winter!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> havent talked to spyro community people forever.
<MASF123> Yup I had to keep smacking the monitor to make it save up that much data.
<GigabitHarmonie> Did you also download more ram to process it? :b
<tSparx> (Don't question it, it's derpy-hooves :P)
<prince-dari> UK, do you have paypal?
<MASF123> Ye- ....uh no. :(
<tSparx> She's the only other person who gets that mantra, besides Pinkie.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> also for what its worth
<Ponies47> brb
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/dSnVX.jpg
<Pyroid> Help. I accidentaly 18 gb derpy? Is this dangerous?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 3 hour print, 1 piece
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> wings didnt work.
<MASF123> no
<prince-dari> Hah, that's awesome
<tSparx> It'd be cool to see an ep where Pinkie and Derpy chill out xD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> printed too small though
<MASF123> Some people want to see less of Pinkie actually. :/
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> What character would you like?
<MASF123> oh!
<prince-dari> Definitely Dash. :P
<MASF123> AJIsAwesome did you see it?
<tSparx> MASF123: That's great for them. *I* couldn't get enough of Pinkie if they tried! :O
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ill make one tonight.
<MASF123> I disconnected before so sorry.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ill leave it white though.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you can paint it if you want.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ill glue all the pieces together.
<MASF123> I think Pinkie gets average screentime.
<MASF123> Some people exaggerate
<MASF123> Twilight and RD get the most IMO.
<tSparx> The only character I don't feel gets enough screentime is actually Fluttershy. Screen time and character development.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I made some ABS cement, it works great, can hardly tell they are glued together
<MASF123> I would like to see less Twi and more background ponies plz.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if you sand the models after they turn out even better.
<RaveBrony> o_o
<MadSurge> MASF123: but... IT'S PINKIE! :O How could you hate her?
<MASF123> AJ gets the least
<tSparx> MASF123: Well, it makes sense for T-Sparx to get a lot of screentime, she's the official mane character.
<Pyroid> yeah... I don't really bother about what character gets how much screentime, I just watch the show
<prince-dari> Yeah, they look gerat
<prince-dari> great*
<tSparx> MadSurge: he doesn't
<tSparx> I bet someone's actually done, like, an official count.
<MadSurge> I wish we get more Applejack too :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I wish I had one of the new ZCorp 3d printers.. they do full color printing.
<tSparx> How much screentime, how much dialogue time.
<prince-dari> Hah
<prince-dari> I just watched that
<tSparx> I just want more ponies period ,3
<prince-dari> XD
<tSparx> <3 *
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But im not $75k rich.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> LOL
*MASF123 rimshots tSparx
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> zcorp is alright for models
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but for anything functional
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its very very expensive.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its not a real plastic, zcorps use fused powder.
<Pyroid> tSparx: you're lucky you didnt say that on 4chan or something
<MASF123> I want more Applejack and Fluttershy. Less RD and Twi plz
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> That wrench cost over $200 in powder and binding agent.
<MASF123> Pinkie, less or more it's fine by me.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 1kg of ABS plastic for my printer costs <$50
<tSparx> Pyroid: I think I can handle 4chan. I don't actually care about anyone there :
<tSparx> :P*
<mitamaking> Applejack is the shortchanged one
<prince-dari> Hahahaha, wow
<Pyroid> tSparx: haha lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Look up "objet 3d printer"
<mitamaking> I think season 2 had a bit too much Pinkie and Fluttershy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and be amazed. Objet makes the best ones, very expensive, but the models can be function, tough, and look good.
<MASF123> Lol. That's a funny joke. mitamaking
<tSparx> Yeah, I really misspoke earlier. I don't think Fluttershy has the least screentime.
<tSparx> But, I feel like she's the least developed as a character.
<Sumica> 00,10needs more augments wrek
*Ponies47 Returns
<Pyroid> yeah, i would agree on that
<prince-dari> So how the printers work, do the start at the bottom and work up in small layers?
<mitamaking> Twillight is the lead, she will get the most, I get that, but maybe it is because of what people choose here but it seems Flutter and Pinkie get a lot of epsiodes
<MASF123> AJ is least developed
<tSparx> She's #5 on my ranking of the mane6, so I don't say that from a place of bias.
<BronyInstrumental> anyone up for some MvM? and hello ponies :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<MASF123> She takes 4th place for me Twi is pretty meh for me.
<tSparx> Hey BronyInstrumental
<Applejack2012> Good evening
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> FDM printers work that way
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Fused Disposition Modeling.
<MadSurge> MASF123: me too :|
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Theres a different kind of printer that works backwards
<prince-dari> O_o
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and the model is up side down
<Ponies47> Hey BronyInstrumental
<tSparx> Oh no no, we're not gonna get into a ranking discussion again, haha
<mitamaking> In order I would guess in episodes, 1.Twi 2.Pinkie 3.Rainbow Dash 4.Fluttershy 5.Rarity 6.Appleajck, and there is also the CMCs
<MASF123> Or was it 5th place she took? :/
<tSparx> No no no
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and theres a pool of special photo-curing resin
<Pyroid> BronyInstrumental: hello, and i'll play mvm
<tSparx> NO NO NO
<MASF123> Let me count...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> that it dips into and stuff
<BronyInstrumental> Pyroid: cool, add me on steam
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its crazy, its made for super high resolution prints, but it takes a very very long time to print anything
<tSparx> DON'T WASTE OUR TIME WITH IT, we all have different opinions on ponies, we *just* did this yesterday, didn't we?
<mitamaking> And in the CMC Applebloom has had two and Sweetie one
<AJIsAwesome> Back with some Fettucini Alfredo. What did I miss?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and the finished prints are not very strong.
<mitamaking> Didn't somepont do the math on screentime
<MASF123> Pinkie>Rainbow Dash>Fluttershy>Applejack>Twilight Sparkle>Rarity.... Yup Twi is 5th for me...my bad.
<mitamaking> *somepony
<Pyroid> BronyInstrumental: just added you
<AJIsAwesome> Are we having this "Best Pony" argument again?:|
<tSparx> mitamaking: It seems likely, but I've never seen it.
<tSparx> Yeah, really, let's not do this.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: /)
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: (\
<mitamaking> I read it once, I want it on me now to use in this discussion
<prince-dari> Wait a second
<prince-dari> I was wathcing a video of one of the objet printers
<tSparx> Char development is much more subjective/opinion-based than screentime, but not *so* subjective that it's not worth talking about
<tSparx> mitamaking: Yeah, I wish I had that too.
<mitamaking> Well you can't be developed if you are not on screen
<prince-dari> And at the end they started showing Doctor Who monster costumes under 'entertainment', as though it was a showcase of what it can do
<MASF123|> Damn disconnect
<tSparx> mitamaking: True, but you can fail to be developed even on screen
<prince-dari> They used them to make some of the monsters in Doctor Who?
<mitamaking> I remember Twi was number one and Pinkie was most concentrated in one episode(Friend in Deed)
<prince-dari> Because that would be fucking awesome
<MASF123|> I think Twi and RD should get their own show.
<mitamaking> tSparx: Applejack proves that, she was in a lot of the Royal Wedding I noticed rewatching it
<Applejack2012> AJ should develope more off screen ;)
<tSparx> mitamaking: Yeah, AJ in Royal Wedding's a *great* example of ponies being on screen but not being developed.
<RaveBrony> I like Rarity how she is :)
<tSparx> Character Development =/= Character Growth.
<tSparx> Char. Development's all about the relationship with the audience growing
<tSparx> At its most basic, it's learning about the char's
<mitamaking> What were AJ's episodes in season 2? SSCS6000 and the one where Derpy stole all the headlines
<RaveBrony> Yep
<tSparx> mitamaking: There was The Last Roundup (or was that ssn1?)
<BronyInstrumental> anyone feel up for some MvM?
<mitamaking> Last Roundup was the Derpy episode right?
<GigabitHarmonie> Eeyup.
<mitamaking> SSCS6000 is mainly remembered for the song anyway
<Saturn> 08,01moar beer
<MASF123|> Twi and RD should get their own show.
<Ponies47> I freakin hate the song "Call Me Maybe" but the version we're the MLP FIM cast sings it. I'll accpect that.
<Wrek> 05http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Sniper-Twilie-324295263
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, GigabitHarmonie.
<MASF123|> Yay Beer Saturn
<GigabitHarmonie> Hello AJIsAwesome! :)
<BronyInstrumental> hallow GigabitHarmonie :3
<Saturn> 08,01fuck that, derpy should get her own spinoff
<mitamaking> How do you put them up so fast
<Jmo> Amen Saturn!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I am not a dr who fan
<Pearly> that be funny
<mitamaking> Saturn: I want Doctor Whooves to be real
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so I wouldnt know
<Pearly> MLD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but they used them for all sorts of crazy stuff
<GigabitHarmonie> Saturn: Derpy should just have her own mini-series.
<Pearly> my little derpy
<GigabitHarmonie> BronyInstrumental: ! Nice to see you!
<Wrek> 05howssat? :D
*Pearly hugs GigabitHarmonie
<mitamaking> Wrek: I don't get the squares
<tSparx> My Little Pony: Derpy Is Magic (The movie)
<Applejack2012> AJ deserves a movie
<tSparx> They all deserve a movie
*GigabitHarmonie hugs Pearly! :)
<MASF123|> I don't like Rarity much, but I named my White horse in RED DEAD REDEMPTION Rarity.
<RaveBrony> Very nice, Wrek! Love all the design but into the background :o
<AJIsAwesome_> That was weird.......guess I have to be in Ghost mode now.:S
*Pearly snuggles GigabitHarmonie
<Pearly> :D
<GigabitHarmonie> Wrek, looks fantastic, I really like the detail as always. It's an awesome weapon asw ell!
<prince-dari> Damn, this is cool
<Pearly> what is this link
<Pearly> so I can book mark it
*Vordox clops at Wrek.
<MASF123|> Lol. I take it back Twilight isn't overrated anymore. Derpy is.
<mitamaking> MASF123|: Oh easy
<mitamaking> Can't even get her name right
<tSparx> Little known fact: this is actually a German cover of Old-Fashioned Love Song :P
<Pearly> O need to get Red Dead
<Applejack2012> well done Wrek
<Pearly> I

<Buytoast> it hurts too much
<MASF123|> mitamaking her name is Derpy!
<Applejack2012> suddenly wall of text
<mitamaking> MASF123|: No it is not
<Ponies47> It's not spam. It's how I would see Derpy's theme
<MASF123|> Ponies47, is it Derpy Hooves or Ditzy Doo?
<CCCP> hello everypony
<MadSurge> MASF123|: does it matter? :3
<alexxm> how you doing CCCP
<MASF123|> MadSurge yes it does
<RaveBrony> Hey CCCP
<CCCP> good alexxm
<MadSurge> Hey CCCP! :$
<tSparx> Hey Socialist State of Soviet Russia
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sorry if I got you addicted :P
<CCCP> hello RaveBrony and MadSurge :)
<AJIsAwesome_> CCCP: Hello!
<BronyInstrumental> hiya CCCP
<Applejack2012> good evening
<CCCP> hello tSparx AJIsAwesome_ and BronyInstrumental ty
<MASF123|> I heard somewhere that Luna was best pony
<Ponies47> MASF123|: It's Derpy of coarse! :D
<Ponies47> Hey CCCP :3
<Anotherguy> Hi guys
<CCCP> hallo Ponies47 :3
<CCCP> hello Anotherguy!
<MASF123|> Derpy Doo was said by one of the creators.
<mitamaking> I will call her Derpy, but I consider her real name Ditzy, Derpy is horribly insulting, and just shows how big of an a** Rainbow is calling her that
<Anotherguy> hello CCCP
<prince-dari> There goes my savings for university. :P
<MASF123|> mitamaking, are you feeling ok?
<tSparx> Mitamaking: I'm pretty sure *we* named her that, like, Bronies named her that
<Dovah> what is Wrek drawing now?
<CCCP> mitamaking you trolling?
<mitamaking> tSparx: I know, it's still insulrting
<Anotherguy> I'm awfully bored
<mitamaking> How is the name Derpy not an insult?
<MASF123|> Either trlling or plain stupid...I can't tell.
<MASF123|> trolling
<AJIsAwesome_> mitamaking: Derpy isn't an insult, it's a term to represent misangled eyes.
<Buytoast> no no
<Dovah> mitamaking: people with real mental disabilties dont find derpy insulting
<Buytoast> could be stupid
<tSparx> mitamaking: In what way? And even if it is, in what way is ditzy *not* insulting?
<Buytoast> it's very possible when dealing with these people
<MASF123|> Lol. Buytoast
<CCCP> Well people get offended by offended by everything
<CCCP> oops
*Jmo slaps CCCP around a bit with a large trout
<CCCP> derp
<Jmo> Like that.
*CCCP seduces Jmo
<MadSurge> Derpy doesn't really mean anything anyway... I like both Derpy and Ditzy tbh
<Jmo> Not one muffin was given that day.
<tSparx> lawl
<MASF123|> I get offended by people being offended by Derpy.
<prince-dari> Are you still into lasers then?
<Pearly> I like derpy
<CCCP> i get offended by bronies
<Anotherguy> I should call her " Grey Mare", but it's too insulting
<MASF123|> Lol. CCCP
<CCCP> and freedom
<MadSurge> Anotherguy: but the Mayor is already a grey mare :D
<MASF123|> We could call her Bubbles.
<Anotherguy> All the grey people in the world will feel insulted
<AJIsAwesome_> mitamaking: If you check the DERP section of Memebase, you'll see the trademark term of "derp" is mispositioned eyes. That doesn't mean she's retardede. I know many people who have mispositioned eyes, but they're in no way stupid or have disabilities. They act and behave the same way normal humans do.
<AJIsAwesome_> *retarted*
<Pearly> I jyst like cartoon characters in general
<Pearly> just*

<Golakka> Good evening
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oh not at all! where else will we get such high quality and totally honest brony news?
<Athgaar> there's one image posted twice in that list
<Polydunami> Hey there Golakka
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good evening Golakka
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: theyre not honest? O.o
<Malk> Kill them they arent ponies or bronies
<Polydunami> Not sure if sarcastic :S
<Golakka> yay! hex strategy!
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: same
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I talk too much >_<
<Athgaar> so this means equestria isn't a reskinned byzantium
<Polydunami> dat kaiser :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: youve said too much! you must hit yourself with a lamp now!
<Golakka> is GilDash alive? cos if he is, hes a mop
<Athgaar> no horse-based special unit and horse-using special building
<Sumica> 00,10twilight_sprinkle, they are very bias.
<Klumzeedragon> xD
<GilDash> Golakka: I see you come in and I wasn't disappointed. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: biased how, its not like they post any opinions
<Golakka> :d
<Klumzeedragon> Congrats Wrek on the EQD feature of Sniper Twi.
<twilight_sprinkle> not any major ones at least
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Sumica> 00,10no they are bias in what they post
<Athgaar> not even just biased
<fluttermac> lyra!!
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: you must not have been here after the season ended
<Golakka> http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=302205845#PIC
<Golakka> GO forth my american friends!
<Golakka> Aqquire!
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: 1st no, 2nd yes
<Applejack2012> Well done Wrek!
<fluttermac> what we watching
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: you mean they only post what works by particular people?
<Golakka> so, who is playing?
<Sumica> 00,10partly yes.
<Celes_Chere> I vote for naval supremacy http://fav.me/d5d1j18
<Polydunami> This is Caramel playing, Golakka
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Golakka: what is that? some kind of "real" Gun?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03ah
<LunarSS> Shizuka: I actually wasn't, what happened?
<Golakka> Its a clockwork rail mag assault rifle
<Golakka> with caseless ammunition
<Golakka> Powered by witchcraft and Gypsy magic
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So... extended mags?
<fluttermac> i love derpy
<Athgaar> canterlot is unprotected
<Athgaar> you just know that's going to be a plot point
<Shizuka> 13despite the fact that we streamed much more than simple marathons of episodes, EQD started lumping us in with other streams that do nothing but pony
<Golakka> no, it has a similar magazine system to the FN-P90
<Shizuka> 13and as soon as the season ended, our newsletters stopped getting posted at all
<twilight_sprinkle> lol thought as much
<Golakka> However it fires caseless ammunition
<twilight_sprinkle> knew it had to do with here...
<Shizuka> 13heaven forbid one of the largest pony streaming sites actually gets exposure
<Malk> I say build endless hords of horsemen
<Buytoast> you should've given seth more dragon dildos
<Golakka> if not the largest Shizuka
<prince-dari> Lawl Buytoast
<Rain> XD
<prince-dari> Or a Trixie 'hand puppet'. :P
<Golakka> Seth... Dragons... oh God, the memories come flooding back
<Buytoast> or both
<Caramel> Yes dari... "hand" puppet
<Athgaar> in the same box
<Rain> and send him a Trixie version of the Lyra plush
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I was gonna suggest a Cynder R34 picture...
<Athgaar> with a note
<Golakka> Trixie hand puppet with a dragon dildo :D
<Athgaar> "you know what to do"
<prince-dari> Oh dear
<prince-dari> Let's not go to TLoS
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: and we won't get into the part where seth was helping draw plans to build a site to knock us off the internet
<Polydunami> So where do politics fit in with the brony fanbase? :S
<Athgaar> poly: not
<CK|GW2> Polydunami: EQD is ALL politics.
<Polydunami> Yeah, it's not a nation :P
<Golakka> The only real politics in the fanbase is 4chan VS ponychan tbh
<Applejack2012> Brony+politic=no good
<Buytoast> not really
<Buytoast> 4chan vs pony is simple
<Buytoast> ponyfags keep starting shit
<Buytoast> people hate them for it
<Barbetos|AtWork> I vote Shizuka as the pony president.
<Rain> its simple
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: Shizuka: well i dont think its very right to hate them because they didnt give us a special post, and after the season-end they probably stopped posting because we no new pony eps. as for the knocking off thing, did he literally tell you it was directed to knock this site off? cause there are plenty of sites similar to this one, just not as good, maybe he jsut wanted to make one too
<Sumica> 00,10I cant wait till we can start placeing bets as to how late eqd will post movie night again once pony eps start.
<Rain> we kill the Batman
<twilight_sprinkle> dat double shizuka
<Malk> Polydunami there are those how who argue whos best pony
<Wrek> 05hey Golakka
<Wrek> 05http://wreky.deviantart.com/art/Sniper-Twilie-324295263
<Golakka> Not as good as pirate rairty
<CK|GW2> Anyways, gonna go kill things. :3
<SirGanjalf> What's this? Civilization?
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: thankfully it fizzled, but it was a severe leak of ideas we'd been building here, and seth was too incompetent to put them into action before we did
<Golakka> nothing can match it :D
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: You know you've been featured on EQD, right?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: leak how? i mean like i said, maybe he didnt want to harm this place, just make his own
<Polydunami> Again, AJIsAwesome? :3
<Buytoast> but he's too much of a cockgobbling prat to want to leave his ivory tower and start some video site
<Shizuka> 13like i said i won't go into it, but suffice to say there was no pretense of friendly competition in what details we heard about him
<Polydunami> I remember when Ghosties was here giving his rant about the whole brony fanbase and what it has become to him.
<Rain> indeed
<Buytoast> i must have missed that
<Shizuka> 13thankfully seth is too incompetent to approach the level of quality we here are capable of
<Buytoast> was it scathing?
<Rain> and I agree with him on it
*MLP_Brovakiin doesn't know what everyone is going on about
<Polydunami> Mainly because I kind of provoked the rant :$
<Malk> Monkeys
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Shizuka, I just scrolled up and saw you announcing the end of a travesty.
<Malk> ??
<prince-dari> Buytoast: Well, Ghosties calls himself an 'anti-brony'
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Join the club.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: "heard" i wouldnt hate someone over rumors too much, couldve just been some misunderstanding.. i know im not going to hate him over rumors at least
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Shizuka, I agree with your gif
<Buytoast> understandable
<Polydunami> Frog's theme, huh?
<Sumica> 00,10twilight_sprinkle, there is far more to it then that
<Rain> indeed, twilight_sprinkle
<Sumica> 00,10and heard of it is recived chat logs
<prince-dari> Shall we drop the EQD talk?
<Rain> I concur, prince-dari ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10probably a good idea dari

<Applejack2012> hello
<cachi01|phone> FFX was my first FF..................... Feel free to kick me as hard as you can
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Timer eater was boring as fuck...
<Polydunami> Mine was actually four :$
<Flyboy> i have this song on my phone. its beautiful <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|phone, I won't
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: I wouldn't have minded it if they put more effort into it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Only thing that made me tollerate it was playing Live and Learn as the music track
<GilDash> cachi01|phone: FF7 was my first FF. Feel free to kick *me* as hard as you can. :D
<Pink3> Hey quick ques what is the drunk pony?
<Polydunami> Berry Punch, I think
<CrimsonPhoenix> instead I'll suggest you to please play the others
<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|phone: I have never played FF :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> especially the SNES ones
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Again Time Eater should have had parts from several sonic final bosses
<Flyboy> GilDash: you think thats bad, i've never played FF at ALL
<tSparx> My first FF was FFVIII, then FFIX, FFVI, FFX, FFXII, FFVII
<Pink3> MUFFINS!
<Pink3> :D
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: True.
<Flootahshy> Random question: What is an estimate for the brony population?
<Derpy_Hooves> pfft FFVI is the best ff
<cachi01|phone> :kickbot slenderman
<tSparx> I've played one of the other 2d FF's, but I don't remember much about it, nor which one
<BerryPunch> cachi01|phone: This command requires at least 2 parameters.
<Flyboy> Pink3: and then i said 'oatmeal? are you serious?!'
<Cypresswolf> ...what to do for the rest of the afternoon? sleep? smash things in Oblivion? Go through my DVR recordings? Hmmm....decisions decisions

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does anyone watch the freelance astronauts?
<AJIsAwesome> xMLPxREACTORx: Civilization.
<Polydunami> Four, to be exact
<Polydunami> Also, I've seen some of their videos, SpadeMagnes[R]
<cachi01|phone> FunFact: Avatar was more expensive than making curiosity and sending it to SPAAAAAAAXE
<tSparx|Reading> Oh sup Poly, haven't seen you around in a day or two, iirc
<Flyboy> who is streaming anyway?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Not to be rude but this type of gameplay looks boring to me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'll still watch
<tSparx|Reading> Flyboy: Crml
<Flyboy> kk
<tSparx|Reading> SpadeMagnes[R]: RTS games aren't for everyone, and Civ moves pretty slowly for an RTS.
<Pink3> GANGNAM STYLE
<tSparx|Reading> I love em though
<cachi01|phone> RTS are also kinda boring for me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There is one thing I am dreading for Mists of Pandaria

<Whiskra> theres like no grind left in wow... unless you see raw questing as grinding
<RaveBrony> Wow has lore! :'( Well, Warcraft did :D

<Caramel> you said 3...
<Panda> Shizuka again, correct.
<Klumzeedragon> He said 8 Caramel.

<cachi01|phone> ^
<Dken2021> what's even more surprising, team fortress 2 has lore
<Flyboy> earlifting. how to buff up when you have some headphones
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: When did you first play??
<Caramel> ah, that's why
<Shizuka> 1307 ish
<Caramel> screencap has the red border right down it
<Shizuka> 13somewhere between 07 and 08
<Caramel> so it looks like a 3
<Shizuka> 13ten day trial, i stopped on day 3
<Sumica> 00,10that cracked me up about wow
<SpadeMagnes[R]> When Cata came out I did the stupidest thing
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: You have to do quests to get the Lore part :D
<Sumica> 00,10free 10day trial, or you could buy a 14 day for 2.99
<Shizuka> 13even DDO stayed interesting for at least a week, atlantica held me for a month before getting dull
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I flew into Orgrimar and did the low level dungeon
<Whiskra> they fixed the entire old world now... questing is so insanely fast its almost not funny
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat smile
<Flyboy> Caramel: what are your cities called then? you better have named one manechester...
<Flyboy> awwww...
<Whiskra> you could get to max level on those 3 days no problem
<Flyboy> yay!
<FlutterMEDIC> dis song works
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I doubt it
<Caramel> it's a pony mod
<Caramel> I'm playing as the Equestrian empire
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 Everyone sings along.

<alexxm> well that sounds satisfying
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I assume the Giant Fel Reaver was a nightmare in the burning crusade days
<prince-dari> No wonder Greece is in such bad recession.
<FlutterMEDIC> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You're minding your own buisness and suddenly you get stomped
<Flyboy> one thing i dont understand about the equestrian empire. how come on the heartswarming eve episode. its way before celestia and lunas rule, yet the flag still shows them on it. PLOTHOLES GALORE

<WindWhistler> I'm doing fine~
<Dken2021> so... is this sorta like buck rodgers?
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: Hello!
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi WindWhistler
<WindWhistler> Today I got an iPad issued by my school
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hi WindWhistler
<p4ngya> WindWhistler: the hell?
<Dken2021> hai WindWhistler
<Polydunami> Oh hey WindWhistler
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Just shows we know how to build our shit.
<Klumzeedragon> xd
<Ihop> hi windo
<Klumzeedragon> :D*
<WindWhistler> Depending on the class you're in, you may get an iPad
<Dken2021> WindWhistler why did they give you an iPad?
<Michael> ejection!
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: I was in a "strategies for learning" class. They're giving all the juniors iPads to see if they perform better in school.
<WindWhistler> Based on previous years, they seem to work well
<tSparx> they're gonna be able to communicate in 3... 2... 1...
<Moopy> heh wow wishi could go to that school and get a ipad
<WindWhistler> First thing I did with my iPad was look for some art apps
<MLP_Brovakiin> WindWhistler: My school is to poor for Ipads :P
<Michael> omg
<WindWhistler> Found some. But I don't have a stylus specifically for iPads...
<tSparx> *your 3... 2... 1... may vary
<alexxm> you find any WindWhistler
<WindWhistler> I don't want to use my finger either.
<WindWhistler> I'm this close to getting a substitute for an LCD-screen tablet.
<Michael> dis gonna be good
<Dken2021> my high school was gonna do some sort of progrram that involved iPads, but they did it after I graduated
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: Sucks for you.
<WindWhistler> That's just like how they added a Japanese class in my middle school when I got into 7th grade
<WindWhistler> I had already chosen my language class by then.
<Dken2021> I know, and then they had better clubs after I graduated too
<WindWhistler> Anyways, until I get a stylus for the iPad, I'm just gonna use it for drawing when I'm at school and not at home.
<Michael> or die!
<Dken2021> even a taxidermy club
<WindWhistler> I see they ripped off Star Wars.
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: Chuck Testa?
<Eulshy> what is this?
<tSparx> Farscape
<Dken2021> WindWhistler uh, yea
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: You don't get it, do you.
<Pink3> This looks stupid
<Dken2021> NOPE
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: Shame.
<Dovah> what did i come back to?
<Polydunami> Look Chuck Testa up when you get the chance, Dken2021
<WindWhistler> Well anyways, I gotta organize my iPod.
<String_Shredder> Dken2021: I see what you did there
<Dovah> and what are the movies tomarrow?
<Polydunami> ... Never mind :P
<tSparx> Farscape
<Dken2021> well someone got it

<SirGanjalf> BileGraze: And Vinyl Scratch is a.k.a. DJ P0N-3
<Rex_Mundi> BileGraze: Partially because the fandom attaches personalities to them and makes them our own.

<Kwaii_icybeauti> Sorry bout the caps...
<Klumzeedragon> BileGraze: It's personal preference. And people hapen to like the character design? Just get over it and don't let it bother you. It would get BORING if everypony just swooned over the mane six and all the fan stuff was just about them, no?
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Besides, it's thought-provoking
<Barbetos> No. She dead.
<RedX> ^^
<Fou_Lou> BileGraze: they are liked because they arent really minor characters anymore. for the community the difference between derpy and say fluttershy isnt that big. so you have fans off all of them

<Kawaii_icybeauti> SpadeMagnes[R]: Well, when Mary appeared in 1917, she did say if russia ended the war, 1000 years of peace for us.
*NocturnalBlade more hugging on Eulshy
<Polydunami> Also, we humans will probably be long gone anyway.
<Obsidian> The 9th had the second shortest run of all the Doctors

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh boy
<Reikim> Man, Rose is my favourite companion.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hell if she said earth, she'd be all O.O

<Polydunami> I dunno, I still like Ian and Barbara as companions
<magmablock> dat 2005 CG

<Polydunami> aka the very first companions
<Pink3> Sumica

<Sumica> 00,10just 2 active
<Reikim> DocSane: Donna is best badass companion, Rose is best romantic companion, Martha sadly occupies a place somewhere in between the two, to her detriment.
<NocturnalBlade> NOT THE PLUMERRRRR!
<Eulshy> MARIO NO
<magmablock> Beep boop, son
<Pink3> sumica i have 5 :)
<flutter_spin> haha
<Obsidian> lol
<DocSane> I want the Doc to just have a male companion for once.
<Reikim> By the way, anyone new to Who: get used to seeing a lot of expendable characters.
<AJIsAwesome> 4 tiny little bots are able to carry a woman? Makes sense to me.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Doc gets all the ladies
<prince-dari> Next Doctor should be a woman
<Reikim> DocSane: Roary. Also he had plenty in Classic Who.
<prince-dari> Would be interesting
<AJIsAwesome> The R2D2 of Doctor Who.
<flutter_spin> lol prince
<Obsidian> lol
<Hat> What place does Micky serve
<Fou_Lou> AJIsAwesome: that a Future bots. Thats enough sense
<DocSane> Reikim: I want Rory to stay and Amy to please go away.
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: a ginger woman mayhaps?

<CountDoofus> Holy crap. Only just now did I discover "Torchwood" is an anagram of "Doctor Who".
<DocSane> Hat: He's the tin dog, of course
<Reikim> DocSane: Didn't they both get shoved off? I distinctly remember this.
<SirGanjalf> "I'm different!"
<Hat> Lol
<DocSane> Reikim: Not permanently.
<flutter_spin> They are part Stormtrooper
<DocSane> Reikim: But the Doc gets a new companion next series.
<Dken2021> CountDoofus I know, weird
<AJIsAwesome> So Rose is the romantic companion?
<magmablock> ya don't say
<flutter_spin> I'm the alien.
<Obsidian> Future Shock
<Reikim> CountDoofus: A bit slow, thar.
<Dken2021> ....what's that supposed to mean doctor?
<RaveBrony> South :D
<flutter_spin> :P
<Petrified_Discord> Inside my brain in a good way. ;)
<Reikim> "Your machine gets inside my head"
<flutter_spin> dat south
<Dken2021> ah, I kid
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, so she dumped her boyfriend for a time lord she doesn't even know? Why? Was her boyfriend a jerk?
<Sumica> 00,10he was a slag
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: He wasn't a time-travelling alien with a nice jacket.
<flutter_spin> this is me and you are you and we are .. together
<Hat> Sensitive topic!
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: Rose is impulsive and knows adventure when she sees it.
<Fou_Lou> AJIsAwesome: its a time machine. she can get back right the moment she left
<CountDoofus> Reikim: I dunno! All I've seen of Doctor Who was on this stream, and only ever seen 1 Torchwood episode. I never noticed it :<
<AJIsAwesome> Ok. Thanks.
<Petrified_Discord> This is why I love the Eccleston doctor the best. He gets angry. He's kind of a jerk and a bit condescending. Like a super-intelligent alien should be. :)
<flutter_spin> dat tech
<Reikim> "Jiggedy Pokery"
<Sumica> 00,10it's like timeie whimie
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You get cell reception in space?
<magmablock> Jiggery pokery is such an advanced term, right up there with "wibbly wobbly timey wimey"
<TheMasterPhoenix> now that's wicked
<Reikim> I still like Tennant best because he's crazy and has a really nice jacket.
<Reikim> Like, really nice.
<XylemTube> making a call backwards in time?
<flutter_spin> lol Reikim
<XylemTube> cool
<DocSane> SpadeMagnes[R]: It's a time/space phone. She can call home to her own time.
<flutter_spin> This is my 4th episode to watch. I have no idea what is going on.
<Reikim> Question: how does the phone decide WHEN to call?
<DocSane> flutter_spin: It's the very start of the series.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I am certainly NOT traveling through time and space
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WAAAAAAAAAAy dead
<flutter_spin> very start of the.. should it be in black and white?
<cachi01|phone> Reikim when i tell it tl
<cachi01|phone> To
<Obsidian> Reikim: Timey Whimy Wibbley Wabblely
<Dken2021> Reikim complex stuff
<DocSane> Reikim: It's kind of locked to Rose's home time
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: you are. right now
<MaidWhite> I wonder how much phone companies that allow calls to different times charge
<Reikim> DocSane: But WHEN along that timeline?
<Polydunami|DW> It's the second of the current series, flutter_spin
<CountDoofus> "Blink" is the best Who episode evah.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh no, Not the time travel logic again! My brain's going to hurt....:S
<Reikim> flutter_spin: The Doctor is an alien who travels around time and space in a police box that is bigger on the inside and has adventures and saves the Universe multiple times. And stuff.
<DocSane> Reikim: It's locked to Rose's relative time line.
<magmablock> Can we watch Blink next?
<Hat> I liked the Girl in the Fireplace best
<XylemTube> Hey boys it's a spy!
<Reikim> DocSane: Ah, I see. Makes sense, though it's hard to explain...
<DocSane> So time passes relatively at the same rate for her and her home time
<Petrified_Discord> Spider sappin' mah space station! :O
<Reikim> His mug is adorable. Sorry.
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I kind of got all that Reikim. It is just I didn't know what part of the season it is.
<Obsidian> magmablock: We've seen that like 20 times on this stream
<DocSane> So if she waits a day and calls home, it knows to call her mum a day later.
<flutter_spin> ctrl alt delete
<Sumica> 00,10why would you even have that
<Reikim> flutter_spin: This is the second episode of the first season.
<thelonepony> i want a Little Robotic Spider :(
<CountDoofus> Aaaaaaand ded.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why the fuck is that even instaled?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Duck.
<Reikim> Sumica: Because idiots.
<Dken2021> geez, with a simple push of a button
<Petrified_Discord> Why would there be a single button that would KILL YOU?
<Hat> Oops spilt my drink, sun filter down!
<magmablock> Obsidian: nevermind then
<AJIsAwesome> Why did he let it do that?:S
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: You, of all people, should now that ducking wouldn't help.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: better question why wouldnt he know how to reverse it
<flutter_spin> really? what year? this looks really recent.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And why didnt he hit the same button?
<SirGanjalf> "Sentry mode: activated"
<Reikim> *know

<cachi01|phone> Such hard what O_o
<flutter_spin> Reikim: lol. I read up on some of Dr. Who, but not sure what episode(s) that was from
<AJIsAwesome> Such hard what?:S
<Reikim> flutter_spin: The Time Lords instituted a Time Lock: the entire segment of the universal timeline containing the Time War is locked. Nobody can travel in or out. The Doctor is the only one to have escaped, due to deserting at some unknown point in the War.
<Falon> AJIsAwesome: kinda everything^^

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why not end of the world as we know it?
<XylemTube> XD why would they play 5 billion year old music? Surely theyve come up with something better by now
<AJIsAwesome> This music is supposed to be fitting?:S
<Hat> It's a 'classic' XylemTube
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Hilariously, it's basically the only event in the Doctor's life that never gets expanded upon.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> oh shit
<Sumica> 00,10better idea, dont be in path of window
<Petrified_Discord> And then Rose died. The End.
<Hat> At least she can get vitamin D
<Dken2021> unless you got SPF 11tibillion, better get out
<spitfirecolt2> this doctor sucks
<Reikim> Sumica: Radiation bounces. She's fried either way.

<Reikim> prince-dari: SPOILERS

*Dovah has sniper trained on Falon "you better not."
<Obsidian> EonMaster: THey wanted to be retro
<SpadeMagnes[R> Heroic sacrifice!
<Dken2021> EonMaster maybe it's the same architecture of castlevania
<flutter_spin> she has the hots
<Sumica> 00,10wood you stop wasteing time
<Reikim> Yes, because CLEARLY several large fans are going to keep that place cool.
<RaveBrony> Dohoho

<Pyroid> and yet rose survives as the windows break intp the vacuum
<SpadeMagnes[R> GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE WINDOW
<flutter_spin> I'm sorry. There are just way too many holes in this show to keep me .. COOL FIRE!
<Obsidian> Shizuka: Up for it but I cant be on too long
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: You dont like your family? D:
<prince-dari> Window hasn't shattered yet
<Reikim> It's like some kind of lame platformer game puzzle.
<SirGanjalf> ^
<DocSane> Heat shields are cracking, not the windows
<Shizuka> 13RaveBrony: it is a massive source of stress for me
<SpadeMagnes[R> This is like Rusty Bucket Bay gone worse
<Pyroid> ah
<Hat> Lucky the wind isn't enough to topple him

<SirGanjalf> Concentrate!
<flutter_spin> holy crap
<AJIsAwesome> Why not use the Sonic Screwdriver to slow down time?
<Shizuka> 13hard to meditate with a four year old screaming
<prince-dari> Because it doesn't slow down time
<SirGanjalf> bye Earth:(
<AJIsAwesome> But I thought it does everything.
<Falon> AJIsAwesome: thats one of the few things it cant do^^
<Obsidian> Shizuka: I know that feeling
<Reikim> Shizuka: I'll join up to help you there. I can sympathize...
<flutter_spin> I read that. Sonic Screwdriver is a tool. It can't really do stuff on its own... really
<XylemTube> Poor Earth :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R> And then a meteor smashed through the window
<Falon> thats what the tardis is for
<Ponies47> Shizuka: I hate little kids. That's one of the biggest reasons why -_-
<Pyroid> Earth... not my home planet anyways
<Discord> You served us well earth :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R> Well she's smoking hot
<AJIsAwesome> Then it doesn't really do everything?
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmmmmm, she was hickory
<Hat> NOT THE BLUE GUY
<Falon> AJIsAwesome: almost^^
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Boooo.....
<DocSane> Poor Moxx
<Falon> AJIsAwesome: oh and it doesnt work on wood^^
<SirGanjalf> Welp, he's not blue anymore...
<Reikim> Sumica: Okay, that one was...painful. Legitimately. Like, I felt a sharp stab of pain, somewhere near my liver.
<RaveBrony> HA
<DocSane> Doc is pissed
<Sumica> 00,10oh and they are weaping willows
<flutter_spin> nice
<Dken2021> what a liar
<flutter_spin> oh oh oh
<Hat> Just twist and go
*Ponies47 Takes out some tomatos
<XylemTube> Oh shit
<RaveBrony> "Oh"

<Reikim> Sumi...okay, that one was all right.
<Petrified_Discord> Lyra: "YAY!"
<flutter_spin> the bikini club?
<RaveBrony> The Human Club
<Spectrum_Rush> ?
<Flootahshy> Okay, I'm back. Hay there everypony.
<AJIsAwesome> Flootahshy: Hello!
<SpadeMagnes[R> How about I shove you out of the window
<Obsidian> uh oh
<Dken2021> what are the hazings of the human club?
*Pyroid pulls out a huge rifle and blows that screen of skin to shreds
<Falon> hello flootah
<SirGanjalf> "I AM DRYYYING"
<Reikim> TAKE IT BITCH
<SpadeMagnes[R> What a world what a world
<Sumica> 00,10eww
<Petrified_Discord> "I'M MELTING, I'M MELTING! I MEAN...DRYING OUT!"
<SpadeMagnes[R> EW

<SpadeMagnes[R> Nasty
<SirGanjalf> ^
<crazypony> ew
<Falon> ewwww
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Reikim> Incidentally, this was a character-defining moment for the Ninth.
<magmablock> :|
<Petrified_Discord> Sexy
<XylemTube> there's no way they even had enough time to help her
<MaidWhite> Yum!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Eww.
<Pyroid> where was the blood coming from in that bitch?
<Flootahshy> What is streamin'?
<SpadeMagnes[R> more like exploding
<prince-dari> Magical flatness surgery kept it all in
<prince-dari> :P
<Dken2021> some season 1 doctor who
<DocSane> Pyroid: Skin has blood vessel
<Ponies47> Flootahshy: Doctor Who
<Discord> How did the humans die?
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: password?
<prince-dari> They didn't
<Shizuka> 13ponies
<Spectrum_Rush> ah that one
<DocSane> Pyroid: You could see them in her.
<prince-dari> They just left and interbred
<Sumica> 00,10oh boo hoo rose
<EonMaster> Discord, they didnt, they bred into the other aliens
<Reikim> Now, an older Doctor would have spared her. Ninth takes a different view, presumably due to the Time War experiences.
<magmablock> Discord: I'm going with grey goo
<Sumica> 00,10hee lets go back in time a day
<flutter_spin> I was just thinking that Sumica
<SirGanjalf> Discord: Judging on her - to much plastic operations
<Pyroid> prince-dari: yeah, but not even her blood vessels could have held that much guts, nevermind, repeat the MST3K Mantra
<Barbetos> Earl GRAY!
<superretroworld> do we go to vinylscratch for movie suggestions?
<TheMasterPhoenix> seriously, time travel is messed up
<Dken2021> and confusing
<Polydunami|DW> dat stock baby cry :S
<AJIsAwesome> Just a random question, but it Discord immortal?
<TheMasterPhoenix> now that she knows how the worlds end
<AJIsAwesome> *is*
<Reikim> superretroworld: Nope, no requests right now. You'll see it's muted.
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: Probably
<DocSane> The point of this episode is to explain the Doctor's point of view.
<prince-dari> I will repeat as I always do in this show
<Barbetos> Polydunami|DW I bet the baby that made that cry is an adult.
<prince-dari> Aliens traveling around in time
<Discord> AJIsAwesome Indeed.
<prince-dari> And you're bothered about blood vessels?
<Barbetos> Maybe even... ded.
<Barbetos> =o
<Barbetos> You are listening to ded babies.
<Polydunami|DW> You mean an adult NOW, Barbetos?
<DocSane> He's seen the death of worlds, including his own.
<flutter_spin> ^^
<superretroworld> Reikim: oh, but where do you go next time?
<prince-dari> Ooh, blood vessels are the most improbable part of this TV show
<SpadeMagnes[R> How is this guy not insane by now?
<Spectrum_Rush> EXPLAIN
<prince-dari> :P
<Sumica> 00,10"just repeat to your self it's just a show and i realy should just relax"
<Dken2021> prince-dari so is logic
<DocSane> He can watch races die and then see them alive again.
<AJIsAwesome> He can go back and prevent the war from happening.
<Pyroid> prince-dari: I will repeat, MST3K Mantra, It's just a show, we should really just relax
<Barbetos> Polydunami|DW I said exactly what I meant.
<DocSane> He exists in a universe of ghosts.
<SpadeMagnes[R> AJIsAwesome: The war is time locked
<Reikim> superretroworld: For what, BMN? You have to sign up for the newsletter and fill out the survey.
<Barbetos> A baby adult is crying.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Ok.
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: No, he can't.
<SpadeMagnes[R> No one can enter the time of it or leave it
<superretroworld> k
<Obsidian> AJIsAwesome: Timelock prevents him
<flutter_spin> AJIsAwesome: You should read up on that Time War. There is ALOT of paradoxes and stuff there
<AJIsAwesome> I know now.
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: He can't do anythign to change his own past.
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: And knowing is half the battle!
<SpadeMagnes[R> So with all the things the Doctor has seen, how has he not gone insane?
<Reikim> Basically, the Time War was one long string of paradoxes. It almost ripped apart the universe.
<AJIsAwesome> G.I. JOE!!!!!!!!!!!
<Pyroid> Aliens
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: Time travel rules seem to be very much dependent on what you know about your own past.
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[R: he is kinda insane already
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R: You're saying he hasn't :P
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R: Alienssss
<AJIsAwesome> So she dumped her boyfriend?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Ah
<flutter_spin> WHOA
<SpadeMagnes[R> ZOMBEH
<Dken2021> she's looks lively to me
<flutter_spin> dat was freaky
<Falon> yay gas aliens :D
<SirGanjalf> Victorian Era Zombies
<Reikim> Oh I remember this one.
<Falon> aww i need to watch this all over again
<Shizuka> 13three more ponies for mvm?
*Discord applauds
<Dken2021> I love how the show hooks you for a next episode
<Discord> I will do MVM
<Hat> Ill join Shizuka!
<flutter_spin> Shizuka: I would play, but I'm new and have no idea what I'm doing
<Discord> Shizuka I will do it
<DocSane> Next time, Gwen Cooper meets the Doctor!
<Reikim> Shizuka: If we can't get three I might be able to round up one more from other places.
<flutter_spin> Shizuka: if you shall take me.. then alright! :P
<magmablock> The credits got it wrong; his name isn't "Doctor Who", it's just the Doctor
<Obsidian> Shizuka: I'm up for it but I need some time
<magmablock> BAH
<SpadeMagnes[R> Shizuka: I would love to but I havent played TF2 in forever and I didnt feel like playing it anymore
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> still have room Shizuka ?
<Discord> Shizuka where do I get on?
<SpadeMagnes[R> AHHHHHHHHH
<DocSane> magmablock: The old show switched between both names
<Shizuka> 13ja 3
<Flootahshy> Ohboy.
<XylemTube> IT SOOO LOUD
<flutter_spin> TOO LOUD
<EonMaster> ow
<flutter_spin> LOL
<SpadeMagnes[R> Jesus...
<Falon> damnit
<Polydunami|DW> magmablock, he was always credited as "Doctor Who". It's been like that since the beginning.
<Reikim> Um. Ow.
<magmablock> huh
<Reikim> So...what is this?
<Pyroid> I HAVE NO IDEA
<Petrified_Discord> Reikim: The future
<XylemTube> God thing I wasn't wearing headphones
<DocSane> Polydunami|DW: No, they switched back and forth.
<Ponies47> brb
<Obsidian> Shizuka: Tell me how to get on your server and I'll be there
<Discord> Shizuka how do I join the MVM game?
<Polydunami|DW> Really now?
<Falon> thats a eardrums blowing death trap
<DocSane> It was Doctor Who in the very beginning, then becmae The Doctor in the 1970s.
<AJIsAwesome> Just a question, but if a Mann Up ticket cost real money and you can only use the cash you receive in the that one game only, What's the pont of playing the Mann up mode?
<Pyroid> Im wearing headphones... ()__()
<NocturnalBlade> gotta go for now guys, see ya later
<SpadeMagnes[R> I have no idea what the shit is this
<Dken2021> seeya NocturnalBlade
<Polydunami|DW> Oh. I'm not up to that point, yet, DocSane
<MaidWhite> Haha, I listen to the stream quietly to stop that from happening
<Flootahshy> Bye NocturnalBlade
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: Can i add you so next time i can just click join? I dont know the server :\
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Bye!

<flutter_spin> Kind of funny when you think about how Gummy was first introduced
<Reikim> I`m coming.
<Ponies47> Back
<SpadeMagnes[R> I still dont see the point of a rock farm
<flutter_spin> Those rocks don't push themselves
<Falon> pony logic
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: It's a cartoon.:D
<SpadeMagnes[R> You cant cultivate rocks like crops
<Sumica> 00,10rock farm is just another way of saying a mine
<SpadeMagnes[R> A mine would be more apt
<Falon> pinky pie can duh^^
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R: But you can "age" rubies.
<Dken2021> my headcannon: it used to be a regular farm, but then the parapsrites showed up and ate everything, then they switched to rocks
<flutter_spin> Think of this. Maybe they collected the rocks because they had gems inside, only they had to give them to the unicorns to break open
<RaveBrony> "TF2 is not responding" Story of my life =_(\
<Sumica> 00,10like callinga super market a food libary
<RaveBrony> There we go
<Reikim> They moved the rocks around to foster gem

<SirGanjalf> SpadeMagnes[R: She was getting stoned
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: I think they explained that in the episode.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I dont know why but I would like to see a episode centered on Zebra culture
<TheMasterPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R, that would be neat for world building
<DocSane> So, can we watch up to Dalek?
<Malk> Ponies47 equestia girls
<flutter_spin> Yeah. Twilight told Fluttershy she was going in there. I forgot what. I didn't really like that episode too much (compared to the others)
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: I like that idea.
<Ponies47> Malk: What about it? :p

<Ponies47> I LOVE the CMC <3

<Dken2021> pretty sure the only canon shipping is only gonna be the cakes and cadence and shining armor
<Flootahshy> thelonepony: Which part? the part when the circle is on top? or on the bottom?
<sirsodaorsomething> whats the original mlp called?
<TheMasterPhoenix> so what does bronystate says on this http://dailycurrant.com/2012/08/30/bill-nye-blasts-todd-akin-challenges-debate/
<SpadeMagnes[R> With all the shit that happens to ponyville how has it not been destroyed?
<pony_8565> i'm gonna sign in now
<thelonepony> on the bottom Flootashy
<robotdragon9> i kinda wish more people would ship cadence and armor with someone else..... to break the monotony
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Magic. *snort**snort*
<Dken2021> robotdragon9 oh well kids show, wattr'ya gonna do?
<DocSane> Someday, they'll give a main character a canon boyfriend, and so many fans will be sad.
<Fou_Lou> Ok im off to night then. Whish you all a good night. See ya tomorro to movie night.
<robotdragon9> heh yeah
<TheMasterPhoenix> DocSane, more like mad
<AJIsAwesome> Fou_Lou: Night!
<TheMasterPhoenix> why sad?
<Dken2021> night Fou_Lou
<robotdragon9> bai Fou_Lou
<Moopy> im really happy right now guys
<AJIsAwesome> Moopy: Why?
<DocSane> They're running out of relationships to explore.
<Dken2021> TheMasterPhoenix becasue it will conficlt with their headcanon
<Moopy> i found gold in minecraft on the xbox
<SpadeMagnes[R> To this day I still think Snips and Snails should have been thrown in jail or something for bringing a Ursa Minor into town
<TheMasterPhoenix> Dken2021, that's mad
<DocSane> TBH, I'd like them to do a story about parents.
<flutter_spin> Anyone try out that new "Where Am I?" game?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: More juvie than jail, IMO.
<Flootahshy> flutter_spin: No, where can i play it?
<TheMasterPhoenix> sad for me is like your waifu is now taken so you won't ever beable to be with her
<DocSane> Snips and Snails are little kids. They're not criminally liable, just stupid.
<TheMasterPhoenix> not that you couldn't from the start anyway
<TheMasterPhoenix> also since stream is oah
<AJIsAwesome> I still have to say, Snips and Snails should've been punished.:D
<TheMasterPhoenix> ovah**
<JRP> shit shit shit shit i sleept in shit
<SpadeMagnes[R> They brought in a giant monster THAT ALMOST DESTROYED THE TOWN because they thought trixie could beat it!
<Kandarihu_> Then their parents are liable.
<JRP> i missed school dam it
<flutter_spin> http://www.parsecproductions.net/games/whereami.html
<Ponies47> Oh dear JRP :S
<robotdragon9> http://www.gameshed.com/Scary-Games/The-House/play.html BWAHAHAHAHA NO ONES SLEEPIN' TONIGHT!!
<flutter_spin> Holy freakin crap --- "Where Am I?" is so scary
<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: I am.
<Obsidian> Well I'm done for the night. Bye everypony.
<AJIsAwesome> Obsidian: Night!
<robotdragon9> oh *disappoint face*.....ok

<CrimsonPhoenix> nopony here knows 'bout mah Irisu Syndrome
<flutter_spin> Alright ^^
<flutter_spin> I scare easy. I almost didn't play it
<pyrocatboy> Goodnight everypony!
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/EBgGgzvJGyM
<robotdragon9> bai pyrocatboy
<lbelmore8> i dont wanna play a game by parsec.... last time i shit my pants
<CrimsonPhoenix> mods are asleep post links
<flutter_spin> FYI: The game was done in 48 hours. It was just a fun little project
<CK|GW2> Damnit Sumi. Now I'm listening to Scootaloo going beep on repeat, and it doesn't blend well with playing GW2. :|
<flutter_spin> (not mine)
<SpadeMagnes[R> 136 people, about as active as a mime
<CrimsonPhoenix> CK http://youtu.be/EBgGgzvJGyM
<CrimsonPhoenix> this might
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R: AYO
<CrimsonPhoenix> haven't played GW2
<Ponies47> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mxfsq8A9wc I'm not fan of this song but I'll accpect this version :P
<SpadeMagnes[R> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPBmDptqlQ&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=11&feature=plpp_video
<robotdragon9> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk3y4Nc1i5I i just thought id give this song a mention (unrelated)
<CK|GW2> CrimsonPhoenix: Too late. Once I start listening to something on repeat, I'm doomed for the next few hours, minimum.
<CrimsonPhoenix> CK|GW2, just give it a chance
<Hat> What is on Friday movie night
<CrimsonPhoenix> Over the Hedge
<robotdragon9> i kinda liked that movie
<Franek12354> aND?
<CK|GW2> No, I mean, once I start listening to something on repeat, I literally cannot stop listening to it. Strange compulsive habit of mine. XD
<lbelmore8> My favourite movie
<SpadeMagnes[R> If Season 3 doesnt have Tank or Peewee in it I will be sad
<flutter_spin> SpadeMagnes[R: yea
<CrimsonPhoenix> CK|GW2, Party pooper
<SpadeMagnes[R> I mean whats the point of giving Dash a pet and never bring it up again
<robotdragon9> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-7rVdXXwds
<Dken2021> I don't think tank wasn;pt cute enough for the audience
<SpadeMagnes[R> I thought he was cute...
<robotdragon9> i liked him....
<flutter_spin> I think they didn't have to deal with the "who powers his device" question
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R: What's the point of bringing it up again? He did his thing. If they need him again they'll show him :)
<SpadeMagnes[R> Well the point is why give her a pet and never mention him again
<flutter_spin> I wonder how many people are playing the "Where Am I?" game
<DocSane> What was the point of Owlicious?
<AJIsAwesome> Have you guys seen the comments in the IGN video? So much butthurt.
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: video?
<lbelmore8> well i shit my pants playing slender so i wont play it
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: EQD.
<flutter_spin> DocSane: Yeah, I didn't care for the owl either. Meant to be another Spike, without replacing him
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, that Metal Gear video?
<DocSane> Well, it was meant to explore dealing with jealousy.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I dont like it when shows create characters soley for a plot and then they get forgotton
<DocSane> Except that Green Isn't Your Color did it better
<flutter_spin> Kind of "hey we need to do something for the lesson here" which I think hurt the episode
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Well that's what the later seasons are for.
<flutter_spin> Whenever its an event-centric or character-development episode, it rules
<flutter_spin> Whenever it is some weird lesson, it suffers
<DocSane> One of the worst lessons was in MMMontFE
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe they'll expand their character. Maybe they won't. In the end, we shouldn't really complain about it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/pJ_jdruQca0
<CrimsonPhoenix> before EQD features it and remix gets done
<DocSane> I hated how Pinkie Pie somehow had to be the lesson object of "Don't make baseless accuations"
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, why?
<DocSane> Meanwhile, a bunch of main characters ruined the Cakes' cake without any reprecussions
<robotdragon9> i just finished watching the predator trilogy...
<SpadeMagnes[R> Yea that was kind of a dick move on their part
<SpadeMagnes[R> They ruin the cake, no punishment what so ever
<DocSane> AJ and Twilight were the only main characters who did nothing wrong, and in the end they didn't get to eat any of the cake.
<flutter_spin> The cake episode had enough thrills and gags to keep it going, but I didn't care about the episode overall. Still better than half of the other ones
<SpadeMagnes[R> Aj was supposed to be a culprate
<SpadeMagnes[R> it got cut though
<lbelmore8> somepony should make a supercut of losing on slender. that would be funny
<Rex_Mundi> IJ is too much of an ikemen to eat the cake
<DocSane> So Twi did nothing wrong and got punished for it.
<flutter_spin> Yeah. They mentioned they had to cut AJ being a part of the whole thing, due to time
<SpadeMagnes[R> So Aj would have done it anyway
<CrimsonPhoenix> We can assume AJ eat the cake when Pinkie was asleep
<flutter_spin> Kind of like the extended backstory of Derpy. They had to cut that out too.
<Rex_Mundi> However, element of Honesty and whathave you, it fits her character to not eat the cake.
<flutter_spin> yet a character can be imperfect.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I know its for plot, but what kind of friends ruin another friend's important thing
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, don't put the elements in the arguments
<flutter_spin> Which makes an interesting episode :)
<DocSane> Friendship Express had funny gags, but was kind of a terrible episode in execution
<CrimsonPhoenix> elements are cores for drastic measures
<superretroworld> i didnt care for that episode
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Budding Friendships OST Released
<PillowPoni> ohay SaxyPretender
<Rex_Mundi> Better than Owls well that ends well
<robotdragon9> i watched it live here
<CrimsonPhoenix> they are irrelevent for something as small as a petty contestant
<DocSane> I liked Owl's Well more than Friendship Express
<flutter_spin> ugh. Let me consult my episode fav list
<SpadeMagnes[R> I know characters should have flaws but the mane 6 can be real jerks to eachother sometimes
<superretroworld> DocSane: that was a great episode, spikes stories are always great
<flutter_spin> "Owl's Well That Ends Well" is 3rd worst episode on my list
<lbelmore8> I have a question
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R, that's what makes the show good
<CrimsonPhoenix> do you want FiM to be like G3?
<cachi01|phone> True friends are jerks to each other and they dont give a shit instead they just laugh
<robotdragon9> i want to put a list of movies i like and everyone hates but im too intimidated to do it...
<Dken2021> ello there SaxyPretender
<Ponies47> Hey SaxyPretender
<CrimsonPhoenix> Where EVERYTHING IS HAPPY AND COLORFUL AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND KIND
<cachi01|phone> Hi saxy :
<SpadeMagnes[R> <.<
<superretroworld> SaxyPretender: hello parking meter
<Shizuka> 13SuperBrony64: you're up
<lbelmore8> robotdragon9: give me a movie
<Reikim> Oh hey, a Saxy.
<SpadeMagnes[R> <><
<robotdragon9> predator 2
<Rex_Mundi> CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjot9jkpmv0
<flutter_spin> "Over a Barrel" was my 2nd worst episode
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dang I missed the sea ponies...
<Dken2021> so...how about that lady rainicorn baby?
<SpadeMagnes[R> So how do phoenixes grow up if they're immortal?
<lbelmore8> robotdragon9: never seen it
<superretroworld> flutter_spin: agreed, im guessing mare do well ep is the worst
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, OSHIT BEST SHOW EVER I have to watch this
<flutter_spin> heh.
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R: Same way an alicorn grows up
<superretroworld> robotdragon9: really, what about the first one?
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes they grow they die they reborn the grow they die
<Rex_Mundi> I dont think cadance is immortal like Luna and Celestia.
<robotdragon9> i like the first one but everyone around me seems to hate the 2nd superretroworld
<SpadeMagnes[R> Isnt Cadence like a winged unicorn or something?
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01|phone, though I admit many media picture them reborn as adults
<SpadeMagnes[R> A different breed of alicorn?
<superretroworld> oh
<Kawaii_icybeauti> worst episode....ummm...My least favorite would be owl
<Kawaii_icybeauti> my least favorite is owl's well ends well.
<cachi01|phone> We still dont know if tia and luna are inmortal
<DocSane> I think alicorns are just automatically proclaimed "princess ponies"\
<FlutterMEDIC> is anything playing for anyone?
<superretroworld> why does everyone hate the owl episode?
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R: The show never calls them "alicorns". It calls them "winged unicorns". Alicorn is only used by fans, even though it's accurate.
<Rex_Mundi> Yeah, like there are "normal" Alicorns like cadance, and then there are Celestia and Luna...
<cachi01|phone> Idj
<twilight_sprinkle> so apparently microwaving a small potato without the skin ignites it
<robotdragon9> i also liked kingdom of the crystal skull *hides*
<FlutterMEDIC> is anything playing?
<flutter_spin> My 4th worst episode: "Swarm of the Century" I don't know. I hated how every pony ignored Pinkie Pie. I just kept shouting at the screen, "SHE KNOWS!!!!"
<JESmith71> So who here was tricked when EqD that fake Hub tweet on Season 3's air date, or did no one fall for it?
<superretroworld> robotdragon9: i liked that movie too, dont worry
<DocSane> How is it accurate? Alicorn is just a name for the material unicorn horns are supposedly made of.
<SpadeMagnes[R> Well Pinkie pie being pinkie pie... would you ever take her seriously?
<robotdragon9> superretroworld, oh ok thanks
<flutter_spin> Hey, she identified them. I would have listened.
<DocSane> SpadeMagnes[R: Pinkie is very rarely wrong, though
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I thought that was real..I even texted my friends...
<flutter_spin> Besides, she isn't 2sided. Pinkie has her moments.
<Petrified_Discord> Kawaii_icybeauti: ...Me too :P
<FlutterMEDIC> guys, is anything playing?
<shibaru> Boo
<SpadeMagnes[R> I would like to know how Pinkie knew about parasprites in the first place
<Rex_Mundi> Cool Trixie art http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m62utfQWpH1r7m1gto1_500.png
<Kimori> yo
<flutter_spin> totally SpadeMagnes[R - Thats what killed me.
<Dken2021> neat
<DocSane> SpadeMagnes[R: She saw them at some point when she was growing up on the farm.
<flutter_spin> She KNEW something more than everyone else. I would have asked what else she knew
<Petrified_Discord> Rex_Mundi: redundant name is redundant :P
<SpadeMagnes[R> It bothers me that a simple earth pony knows what parasprites are but the goddess of the fuckign sun doesnt
<tSparx> Hi everypony <3
<Dken2021> ello tSparx
<robotdragon9> EY tSparx
<Ponies47> Hey tSparx
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R: Pinkie's weird *shrug*
<superretroworld> the worst ep in my opinion is over a barrel
<DocSane> SpadeMagnes[R: Maybe Celestia is neither omnicient nor omnipotent
<flutter_spin> But most of my ratings are based on how much I personally liked the episode, if there wasn't some glaring flaw that bothered me the entire time
<superretroworld> hey tSparx
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'll tell my friend it was a troll when I go back to school on tuesday.
<flutter_spin> superretroworld: its my 2nd worst
<DocSane> Over a Barrel is great just for its self-deconstruction of girl show tropes.
<SpadeMagnes[R> Well I highly doubt the parasprites never caused damage befor ethat episode
<flutter_spin> STREAm
*Unnr thinks the worst episode was the Hearth´s Warming Eve one
<lbelmore8> I dont have a favourite episode
<cachi01|phone> TF2!!!
<tSparx> Which one is Over a Barrel again?
<cachi01|phone> I Spy MvM
<flutter_spin> the buffalos
<DrSteveSCARz> whos streamin?
<Ponies47> Ohai Shizuka stream
<Rex_Mundi> Whoes streaming?
<JESmith71> tSparx: The one where they go to Appleloosa
<lbelmore8> T.F.2!!!!
<tSparx> I liked that one fine, wasn't my fav or anything but.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> tSparx: When they go to applelosa.
<superretroworld> tSparx: the ponies against the bulls
<DJ_POn-3> nope its 2 unicorns and nine marshmallows
<Rex_Mundi> The vission has been doubled!
<shibaru> I have blood in my ear again 8)
<robotdragon9> i dont watch the amazing mare do well anymore cause of that supposed appledash kiss scene, it bothers me whenever its pointed out and i cant escape it.
<lbelmore8> Wait i mean i dont have a not liked episode
<flutter_spin> Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 is down there on the list too. The episode was great, but I hated it. So many things bugged me in the episode.
<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: I really hated that joke. It seriously annoyed me.
<Kimori> >.<
<robotdragon9> ikr
<tSparx> I don't like every episode, and there are some I haven't even watched all of, but I don't think they're objectively bad.
<Rex_Mundi> robotdragon9: Doesnt bother me:D........ They diddnt kiss, but it looked like it did, thus the joke.
<shibaru> Why do my ears bleed so much?
<Kimori> I dont know
<flutter_spin> ditto tSparx .
<JRP> SuperBrony64:
<cachi01|phone> Over the barrel will be released on 2 weeks in mexico
<SpadeMagnes[R> I didnt really like the premise of the Mare do well episode
<flutter_spin> except the not watching every episode :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Griffon the brush off is a good one, but I don't watch it too much because I can't honestly stand Gilda, especially when she made fluttershy cry.
<lbelmore8> engineers all like "haters gonna hate"
<shibaru> Especially my right ear. My right ear is the one that always gets infected and stuff
<flutter_spin> can't stand*
<robotdragon9> is it me or did they have a picture of asuka souryu back over there?
<superretroworld> Kawaii_icybeauti: *shivers
<SpadeMagnes[R> Man this place sure is lively
<AJIsAwesome> If I ever NOT like an episode, I would lke the moral behind it. As long as the episode as a moral behind it, I'm fine with it.
<tSparx> Would I get a lot flak if I admitted that I don't like the CMC eps very much?
<Rex_Mundi> Think wee will ever see a male Alicorn? Just one please Hasbro, I want to know they exist. But not one like Celestia or Luna, more "normal" like Cadance.
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone: in canada it hasent even been heard of
<Kawaii_icybeauti> What other episodes....umm.....I guess that's all I have to complain about. I like all the rest.
<flutter_spin> LOL. tSparx I don't like CMC episodes either.
<cachi01|phone> lbelmore8 really?
<AJIsAwesome> So far, I don't have an episode I DON'T like. I pretty much like all of them.
<Dken2021> oh talking about episodes eh?
<WindWhistler> The CMC episodes aren't that good...
<robotdragon9> for some reason, i like to say that xenomorphs have a nest on a contienent far from equestria in my fanon.
<WindWhistler> They all act like idiots
<WindWhistler> I mean COME ON
<cachi01|phone> lbelmore8 here in mexico we get 5 new episodes every 3 months or 4 :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I also can't watch show stoppers because I'm watching them deny their talents...I can't stand it.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: So what range is the Pyro good at? Ranged or up close?
<tSparx> WindWhistler: That's not why I don't like them -- they are little kids after all.
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone: i'm dead serious i dont even think season 1 is done
<Rex_Mundi> WindWhistler: I love the CMC episodes.
<flutter_spin> The thing is, the CMC are embarrassing to watch. They just goof around doing crazy things.
<Dken2021> children are naive sometimes
<Kawaii_icybeauti> but hearts and hooves day is a personal favorite of mine.
<SpadeMagnes[R> robotdragon9: given the fact that ponyville iis near a gate to taurterus I wouldent put it past me
<WindWhistler> tSparx: I think even kids would realize some of these things...
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: Close
<cachi01|phone> lbelmore8 same here.
<WindWhistler> I bet they have ADHD or OCD or something
<robotdragon9> the only one i really liked was hearts and hooves day it was pretty funny
<WindWhistler> must explain why they're such idiots
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ADD was created by companies to sell ritalin.
<tSparx> WindWhistler: Well, they're little kids in a show made for little kids, so they have to be dumb from a little kid's POV
<robotdragon9> *out of the CMC ones
<cachi01|phone> Season 2 is going to premiere i think in 7 months here in mexico
<superretroworld> WindWhistler: doesnt everybody have one of those?
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone: canada has its ups and downs
<AJIsAwesome> How come I don't see a lot of people use demoman on the MvM matches?
<SpadeMagnes[R> You would think with all the shit the CMC they would have cause millions of damage or something
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Aaaaand just realized stream @_@ Is it dear Shizu? :3
<tSparx> WindWhistler: Well, people with OCD and ADHD aren't any less intelligent than the rest of us.
<SpadeMagnes[R> *do
<flutter_spin> "Sisterhooves Social" has to be in the top 20 favorite episodes on my list
<tSparx> WindWhistler: My sister is a goddamn genius and she has ADHD
<WindWhistler> tSparx: Well of course I know that. I'm one of them. >.>
<robotdragon9> SpadeMagnes lol
<otakon> hi guys
<WindWhistler> I have ADHD and OCD and Aspergers
<otakon> finally got me a wired controller
<robotdragon9> EY otakon
<WindWhistler> So don't go yelling at me.
<cachi01|phone> Hi otakon!
<Dken2021> hey otakon
<otakon> so NO MORE SUCKING SO MUCH AT TF2!
<tSparx> WindWhistler: oh, sorry, I get all social-justicey sometimes :P
<otakon> now brb
<superretroworld> owl that ends well, the last roundup, and a friend in deed are my favourites
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I loved the season 2 premire better than the first one...But there's something about the first one that makes it a treasure....Maybe it's because of it being my first pony episode.
<DrSteveSCARz> otakon: What kind of controller is it, i need one also but i cant find one that compatable
<DJ_POn-3> WindWhistler: is that u Mitchell
<RainbowDash90> RRRRRAAAAWWWEEEERRRRRR
<Rex_Mundi> Once people can clearly define what ADHD and ADD even is, then I might start declaring people to have it.
<tSparx> Lesson Zero I loved. Objectively, I think it's pretty bad, but watching T-Sparx go insane was AWESOME.
<robotdragon9> yes thats f*cking asuka
<Reikim> otakon: You're still going to suck.
<WindWhistler> I'm already in a bad mood anyways...
<cachi01|phone> Dance shizu dance
<flutter_spin> really? huh. If an episode surprises me or makes me laugh, I love it. If there is some glaring problem or horrible moment in it, I don't like it.
<WindWhistler> All of a sudden I just got so gosh darn miserable...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Actually, kids they claim have ADD are actually going to be the smarter kids.
<shibaru> And my chest has been hurting a lot
<WindWhistler> Kawaii_icybeauti: That's always the case
<pony_7007> is wrek streaming?
<WindWhistler> The ones with mental disabilities are geniuses
<flutter_spin> "Cutie Pox" for example. It was good... and bad.
<SpadeMagnes[R> I know I shoudlent use logic for cartoon shows but sometimes I need to use it
<cachi01|phone> Owl that ends well in spanish its called buho de la discordia (the owl of discord)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> WindWhistler: Then they prescribe meds, and their minds get trashed by them.
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Rex_Mundi> I still say that Owl is evil
<flutter_spin> dat pyro
<WindWhistler> Kawaii_icybeauti: I take meds. My mind isn't getting trashed.
<SpadeMagnes[R> PING
<OohShiny> sup everypony
<AJIsAwesome> When it all boils down, I will never hate anything about thte show, IMO. It's well written, well animated, and it has some of the greatest songs of our time. Plus considering the fact that this show saved me from a neverending lifetime of anger, depression, suicidal thoughts, and angst.
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Owloysius?
<AJIsAwesome> *the*
<WindWhistler> In fact, I find the medicine to be a lifesaver
<LadyCanary|wubwub> ...Yeeeeeeeep, this is a Shizu stream.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> WindWhistler: You aren't on ritalin, are you?
<WindWhistler> It saves me from making a fool out of myself
<Kandarihu> Kawaii_icybeauti, I was like that. I was VERY ADD (still am, I guess).
<robotdragon9> WindWhistler i went into depression last night for some reason
<WindWhistler> Kawaii_icybeauti: Vyvanse
<flutter_spin> AJIsAwesome: Winter Wrap Up still gives me goosebumps, especially during Twilight's part
<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: Yep, I so expected it to start hooting evily at the end of the episode.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: I certainly don't *hate* any of the episodes :P
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> WindWhistler: You must be an adult then. I mean when they prescribe it to like 5 year olds.
<DJ_POn-3> i like each episode equally
<AJIsAwesome> How good is the Demoman on MvM?
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone:come to think of it i think its not even on my tv provider
<WindWhistler> Kawaii_icybeauti: I seem to recall taking Vyvanse my whole life...
<otakon> Rex_Mundi: how can you hoot evilly? maybe shifty eyebrows perhaps but evil hootin?
<superretroworld> tSparx: youre probaly a true brony then
<AJIsAwesome> I will let you know, Depression and Anger REALLY don't mix well.......
<flutter_spin> I didn't like "Suited for Success" simply because the ponies thought those WONDERFUL DRESSES were awful
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Aw, I love Owloysius <3 (to each his own though)
<Moopy> ha dat shizuka dancing thats great
<WindWhistler> along with Buspirone and Prozac
<WindWhistler> And I used to take Zoloft
<flutter_spin> That moment killed the episode for me.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> WindWhistler: Guess your lucky then. I've heard many stories of people getting really messed up on meds like that.
<cachi01|phone> lbelmore8 here in mexico we have discovery kids. Not hub :p so i have to watch MLP in fucking discovery kids :(
<robotdragon9> ouch
<flutter_spin> But to push out the moral of the episode, it fit well
<Rex_Mundi> otakon: Trust me, that Owl is up to no good.
<DocSane> flutter_spin: Suited For Success is one of my very favorites
<otakon> okay brb trying out new controller
<tSparx> superretroworld: I don't wanna define what a "true" brony is, but I am a male in the 18-25 range who *adores* this show, so I probably am :D
<Reikim> otakon: And sucking at TF2?
*DrSteveSCARz wishing TF2 ran as smoothly as shizus
<WindWhistler> flutter_spin: Is that the one with Rarity creating the Gala dresses?
<superretroworld> tSparx: but im under 18, so does that still count?
<robotdragon9> TEH GUARDIANS OF GAHOOLE
<flutter_spin> DocSane: oh trust me, its up there. The dresses alone tosses it up #17 on my list
<Rex_Mundi> So who is streaming?
<DocSane> cachi01|phone: I was just down in Costa Rica. Saw MLP on DKids
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone: i just looked i have to watch it on treehouse
<tSparx> superretroworld: Oh certainly! I think anyone can be a brony!
<AJIsAwesome> How good is the Demoman on MvM?
<Reikim> WHY MUST WE HAVE LISTS
<DJ_POn-3> i'm 15 and am addicted to MLP
<otakon> Reikim: I already suck at it, the controller can only improve my ability
<Ponies47> I'm getting a new computer TOMORROW so I hope it runs TF2 good :3
<AJIsAwesome> Is the scout any good?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> oh love suited for success. Well, I love all of rarity's episodes, that's jsut me.
<IshNewLaptopPony> ohai pony pepple
<Ponies47> DJ_POn-3: I'm 14 and the same :P
<superretroworld> k
<AJIsAwesome> IshNewLaptopPony: Hello!
<Rex_Mundi> Im 22 and I have cruches on the characters all the time
<DJ_POn-3> yay
<cachi01|phone> Im also 14
<tSparx> superretroworld: But the overwhelming majority of the people outside the show's target demographic are in that demographic, that's all
<robotdragon9> me too DJ_POn-3
<superretroworld> hey IshNewLaptopPony
<DocSane> Rex_Mundi: Funny how that works, huh?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> im also 14 :)
<DJ_POn-3> yay again
<Kandarihu> I'd say any male fan of FiM is a Brony regardless of age. Any girl over the target demographic is also a Brony.
<crazypony> i'm 14 too
<DJ_POn-3> turning 16 in october
<DocSane> So many young kids in here...
<flutter_spin> I didn't care too much for "Sonic Rainboom" but Fluttershy's yay punches it up there :)
<tSparx> Wow, y'all are young >_>
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: denoman is Pretty good fro destroying the tank from the last wave, other than that it can be useful
<cachi01|phone> 14 FTW
<lbelmore8> i'm 13
<Rex_Mundi> DocSane: Its just rediculously easy to fall n love with ponies.
<Unnr> Kandarihu That's because pegasister is a silly term that doesn' t roll trippingly off the tongue
<thelonepony> turning 16 on November
<WindWhistler> tSparx: MLP wasn't just made for little girls. It was made for all people.
<AJIsAwesome> How about the Scout? Is he useful?
<Ponies47> Hey IshNewLaptopPony! Nice you got a new computer! I'm getting a new one tomorrow :3
<Kandarihu> Unnr, indeed.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> We're the youngens...You can ask off to scram off the lawn noq.
<DocSane> Rex_Mundi: But do you think of them as people or as ponies?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> now*
<cachi01|phone> Im 14 turning 74 tomorrow
<WindWhistler> YOU DANG KIDS
<WindWhistler> GET OFF MY LAWN
<DJ_POn-3> ikr i get all my friends except those stubborn one's to "Join the herd"
<flutter_spin> It doesn't surprise me there are young ones in here anymore. I'm currently 27
<Rex_Mundi> DocSane: they are characters...
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: FINALLY, I've been waiting for someone to say that!:|
<tSparx> WindWhistler: The show had a target demographic, a marketing dept., a clear idea of who they were making the show for, and (more pertinently) who they were advertising it to.
*Ponies47 Dances on WindWhistler's lawn
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: Actually I'm only 16
<cachi01|phone> WindWhistler u cant tell me what to do!
<DrSteveSCARz> AJIsAwesome: Only during the first few waves, after that, it isnt that great unless you upgrade it alot
<tSparx> WindWhistler: And then suddenly all us college-age dudes showed up.
<DocSane> Rex_Mundi: Right, but consider the implications of saying you get crushes on them.
<Reikim> Lies, Spy is best money-grabber.
<Kandarihu> My mind right now is divided between PSO2 and the RNC
<Ponies47> I'm 14 and will be 15 on December 6th :P
<WindWhistler> tSparx: Lauren Faust specifically stated it wasn't just made for little girls
*cachi01|phone planks on WhindWhistler's lawn
<Reikim> *Scout
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, it is better that us youngons love the show. It's better than us being into the...ahem...expected stuff.
<tSparx> WindWhistler: That's not what I'm trying to say.
<cachi01|phone> I will be 15 in march 10 :)
<tSparx> WindWhistler: A target demographic is purely a marketing thing.
<AJIsAwesome> The show was targeted for young children, but the show was MADE for all ages.
<IshNewLaptopPony> ohai reg- the chats dead isn't it
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: WHAT YOU SAID
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cachi01|phone: Wow, my bdays's 2 days before yours o.O
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Thanks, haha
<Reikim> Yep
<DocSane> I find MLP fans to be a good quality of fan.
<lbelmore8> WindWhistler: *throws rocks a window* stupid old people!
<flutter_spin> In all seriousness, I think age ruins the experience. If you talk and act like a mature adult that is 25... that makes you even cooler
<Rex_Mundi> DocSane: Not many implications, people have crushes on fctional characters all the time. I wasnt the only 1 year old with a crush on a certain Hyrulian princess I bet.
<Moopy> i wish they can make man vs machine for the xbox to
<Rex_Mundi> *10 I mean
<DocSane> They tend to genuinely like the show, as opposed to claiming they like it and then complaining all the time
<superretroworld> DocSane: its one of the biggest too, probaly bigger then star trek
<DrSteveSCARz> i wisht TF2 was on consoles
<Kawaii_icybeauti> A lot of people have told me I act beyond my years....It feels strange at times.
<flutter_spin> I had a crush on Yukiko
<cachi01|phone> Kawaii_icybeauti really? Your bday is also one of my best friends birthday lol
<robotdragon9> Rex_mundi i have crushes on cadnece , fluttershy, and rainbow dash
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: I think DocSane's suggesting that crush = you wanna bone them.
<cachi01|phone> March FTW
<flutter_spin> Persona 4 ftw
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cachi01|phone: My brother is 2 days after yours, and my other one is 4 days after yours...Cool
<DocSane> tSparx: Actually, no.
<WindWhistler> By the way, one of you guys said something that reminded me of this picture: http://fav.me/d4mtms4
<Kandarihu> Perhaps a better way to define the standard of "above the target age" would be to consider the typical age demographic of the G4 toys, or the media of earlier generations.
<IshNewLaptopPony> I like pie
<tSparx> DocSane: Well I don't mean to put words in your mouth. Please, explain.
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone: lol mine is on april 30
<DocSane> tSparx: I get pissed off at those who make that assumption.
<Shizuka> 13hai ponies
<Shizuka> 13enjoying?
<WindWhistler> OMG SHIZUKA
<DrSteveSCARz> bye everypony i gotta go, see ya tomorrow for BMN
<cachi01|phone> Yay it was me WindWhistler I WON
*WindWhistler glomps Shizuka
<robotdragon9> EY Shizuka
<Reikim> So do I
<flutter_spin> I better go too :(
<superretroworld> bye DrSteveSCARz
<Reikim> I prefer blueberry.
<thelonepony> eeyup
<Rex_Mundi> Hugs Shizuka
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, G1 was for little kids, and G2 was sorta made to try to keep that audience. G3 went back to little girls, and G4 is killing that target.
<DocSane> tSparx: No, it's that you can accept non-human characters as human very easily.
<Unnr> G'evening Shizuka!
<flutter_spin> My mom is here with my great aunt nelly
<Ponies47> Yesh we are Shizuka!
<flutter_spin> She is 97!!!!!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> *keep the older audience
<Reikim> They seem to be too busy taking themselves seriously, Shizuka.
<tSparx> DocSane: Ah!
<tSparx> DocSane: Haha, I see :)
<cachi01|phone> G2 was one of the series I hated.......I DONT CARE ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL PONIES IN LOVE GODDAMMIT
<IshNewLaptopPony> No pie is better than teh Lemon Merengue
<WindWhistler> cachi01|phone: Congrats. Have an ASDF reference: http://fav.me/d4ydji6
<superretroworld> cachi01|phone: 90210, in pony form
<Rex_Mundi> G2 wasnt too bad, it has its moments
<DocSane> tSparx: The difference between most MLP fans and, say, Adventure Time fans is that MLP fans seem to form very strong, visceral emotional connections with these characters.
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, that's G1.5
<Moopy> Man i wish i can get TF2 game for the P C console and play with some of you guys
<SaxyPretender> 0,14'MURICA
<IshNewLaptopPony> FUCK YEAH
<cachi01|phone> WindWhistler lol i love that scene
<superretroworld> cachi01|phone: but i wouldnt mind seeing the g4 ponies in love
<AJIsAwesome> Is TF2 availble online for consoles or purchase via copies of the game?
<WindWhistler> DocSane: I formed a strong visceral emotional connection with some video game characters that have hardly been fleshed out at all.
<JRP> Moopy: tf2 is free to play
<tSparx> DocSane: I know I do! I've had dreams hanging out with the mane6, and I'd love to meet any one of them some day. And I have a legit crush on T-Sparx somedays :P
<WindWhistler> And Rengeteki...
<Ponies47> TF2 is fun. It will be evern better when I get my new computer tomorrow :3
<DocSane> tSparx: A friend of mine was constantly giving me shit about my liking the show, saying that I was being pretentious to suggest it's anything more than a reasonably good cartoon with some pop culture references.
<WindWhistler> Oh lord...Rengeteki caused me a lot of pain
<cachi01|phone> Keep the shippin outta mah beloved G4 ponies
<Ponies47> *even
*IshNewLaptopPony should have picked Rango foar A movie
<Moopy> well my computer grahics is crapy on mine
<cachi01|phone> ^
<DocSane> tSparx: Who is T-Sparx?
<WindWhistler> Is it wrong to cherish fictional characters?
<robotdragon9> im really enjoying mass effect 2
<superretroworld> Ponies47: lets just hope it can run tf2
<tSparx> DocSane: Twilight Sparkle
<WindWhistler> robotdragon9: Don't play ME3
<tSparx> DocSane: tSparx = me, T-Sparx = her
<DocSane> WindWhistler: No. I'd say it's pretty common.
<Reikim> Ohai Saxy
<DocSane> tSparx: Ah.
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Yeah. Like what happened the other day. -_-
<Moopy> i have the sony compaq computer dude
<WindWhistler> DocSane: Okay. Then my campaign to get a midboss recognized wasn't completely idiotic...
*WindWhistler sobs
<cachi01|phone> MEDIC IM BEING AXED BY A SHIZUKA
<DocSane> tSparx: Twi is an idealized nerd girlfriend.
<superretroworld> Ponies47: what other day?
<tSparx> DocSane: T-Sparx and I are so similar, you have no idea.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> inb4 someone yells medic
<IshNewLaptopPony> You so Saxy, and a pretender, SaxyPretender
<WindWhistler> What the heck are they doing?
<Eulshy> Man stuff

<tSparx> DocSane: It's weird for me to crush on someone so similar to me, but hey
<WindWhistler> It seems like womanly stuff
<Moopy> the valo sony compaq computer
<Big_Macintosh_1992> hello everyone!
<AJIsAwesome> So is the Mass Effect 3 ending mediocre at best?
<Moopy> hello gig mac
<lbelmore8> What takes up more resources minecraft or tf2?
<AJIsAwesome> Big_Macintosh_1992: Hello!
<Moopy> i mean big mac
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: it's pathetic at best
<cachi01|phone> Theres a DLC which made the ending good
<DocSane> tSparx: There's a reason MLP resonates with older fans so well. It also proves that boys can very easily identify with girls.
<thelonepony> hai Big_Macintosh_1992
<robotdragon9> if i do get the 3rd game ill just look up the new endings on youtube
<Big_Macintosh_1992> hello AJIsAwesome and thelonepony
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, what I've heard is that it's terrible at best. And the DLC didn't make things good enough.
<robotdragon9> pick which one i like best
*IshNewLaptopPony licks Saxy's cheek
<WindWhistler> robotdragon9: Don't even bother getting the third game
<tSparx> DocSane: ABSOLUTELY AGREED!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Oh I was playing MvM with some other boronystaters and I had a ton of lag. So I keept getting killed and such
<SaxyPretender> 0,14No.
<WindWhistler> robotdragon9: The endings are all the same.
<cachi01|phone> MY DICK WILL REVEAL AGAINST ITS CREATOR
<IshNewLaptopPony> :(
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I really do love the way this fanbase is blurring gender lines. (In a good way)
<AJIsAwesome> Kawaii_icybeauti: Same here.:)
<DocSane> tSparx: I have a theory that part of the show's appeal is that young teen boys very often find girls kind of mysterious, and there aren't many well-rounded portrayals of young girls in the media.
<Reikim> Saxy
<Reikim> That is one sexy cosplay.
*IshNewLaptopPony nibbles Saxy's ear?
<superretroworld> Ponies47: that sucks
<lbelmore8> mass effect 3 ending choosing: Pick a colour!
<cachi01|phone> Lol boronystaters
<robotdragon9> id pick green splosions
<DocSane> tSparx: MLP is one of the very few that avoids the usual portrayals of them only being obsessed with romantic relationships.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Yeah, there's this barred sterotype for girl's televison that it MUSt suck, and this changed that....Well...if you count disney...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat Natsu is mai waifu
<Reikim> Natsu?
<DocSane> Kawaii_icybeauti: I think it goes beyond that
<cachi01|phone> Who else is sick of phineas and ferb?
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: I am.
<Reikim> Who is this?
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone: somewhat
<cachi01|phone> Its all the same shit every episode
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Yeah. At 1 point I need more metal for my sentry and I had no despencer set up. I tryed to walk over to crate but it was lagging so bad I couldn't get to it
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: You have NO idea how much I dislike the show.:|
<DocSane> Kawaii_icybeauti: MLP has a very easy femininity to it.
<IshNewLaptopPony> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8s2a3XCDA1r06u14.jpg
<tSparx> DocSane: I've always been friends with lots of girls, and more open to girliness than most guys, and I have definitely noticed that bronies seem to understand girls better than most non-bronies
<Kawaii_icybeauti> DocSane: Of course it's girly, the bright colors and the fantasy land does that
<lbelmore8> cachi01|phone: actually yes i hate it
<tSparx> DocSane: Tears down a lot of the usual assumptions about girls AND guys
<AJIsAwesome> I am sick of people shoving that show down my throat. I can't stand to watch a SINGLE episode.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Taki's replacement in Soul Calibur
<Reikim> Who is Taki?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> AJIsAwesome: which show?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14aka the character that chick is cosplaying
<SpadeMagnes[R> I thought it was ok
<AJIsAwesome> Big_Macintosh_1992: Phineas and Ferb.
*Unnr actually likes phineas and ferb
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: What show you talkin bout?
<Rex_Mundi> Ive always sort of liked girls, Peach being my favorite character in mario party since I first got the game back in the 90s
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Taki is the ninja girl from Soul Calibur
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome the mom.is so stupid
<Reikim> Okay then, I guess.
<DocSane> Kawaii_icybeauti: The fact that all the main characters are girls is so casually assumed and not an issue that it breaks down a barrier of mystery that can exists between boys and girls.
<cachi01|phone> It just makes me rage
<robotdragon9> i dont really care bout phineas and ferb
<Reikim> Ugh, done with manechat.
*Big_Macintosh_1992 doesn't mind Phineas and Ferb
<cachi01|phone> BUCK PHINEAS AND FERB AND BUCK.THEIR SHOW
<lbelmore8> Hoy do you use italics Unnr?
<superretroworld> Unnr: :[
<DocSane> Many girls shows make a huge deal about being "girly".
<Unnr> /)ō3ō(\
<Reikim> Every time they start debating worst/best episode, it's just annoying.
<AJIsAwesome> The show is okay, IMO. It's just that people kept trying to make me like the show more than I already and I hate it because of that.:|
<Reikim> Like Best Poni, onyl worse.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Phineas and Ferb is alright
<Moopy> the reason i play TF2 on the xbox cause i play as egineer cause they take more shooting damage to the enimies better
<Reikim> *only
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Oh phineas and ferb? That show came out I think it was beginning of 6th grade? I so still enjoy it, and across the second dimension was very well done. It sort of brought Disney out from the grave temporarily.
<pony_7007> peach makes me angry, it's always either her or yoshi who beats me in mariokart
<SpadeMagnes[R> Not that I would ever consider stealing on but does Nintendo have the power to shut down a 3DS from anywhere?
<SpadeMagnes[R> *one
<cachi01|phone> SaxyPretender it was alright but then every episode was the.samr
<Rex_Mundi> Some of the best girl characters are on boys shows, thats ironic
<cachi01|phone> Same
<Unnr> lbelmore8: using /me like many things, its best used in moderation
<Big_Macintosh_1992> lbelmore8: use /me :message:
<Shizuka> 13so much arguing :<
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But the show ended....It was sort of the same case as Invader ZIM was.
<superretroworld> SpadeMagnes[R: probaly the internet but i dont think a 3ds
<DocSane> Rex_Mundi: Most shows ARE boy's shows, so that isn't surprising.
<robotdragon9> :c
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, Shizuka.:$
<cachi01|phone> Juliet starling is best zombie hunter
<Unnr> as it can be seen as role playing, but I tend to like to use it for Illeism
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: So how many side weapons are accessible to the Pyro?
*Big_Macintosh_1992 Ordered three seasons of Angry Beavers for my Birthday yesterday
<lbelmore8> Thanks to all who tell me how
<DocSane> Girl shows and girl toys tend to push a single ideal of femininity and what girls are supposed to like.
<cachi01|phone> Juliet is mah fave female videogame character
<SpadeMagnes[R> My sister watches power rangers yet she gives me crap about watching MLP
<Rex_Mundi> Its way worse with anime, female characters I mean
<AJIsAwesome> Big_Macintosh_1992: I LOVE Angry Beavers.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> AJIsAwesome: right?
<cachi01|phone> LOL new power rangers sucks
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ah 90's television..I wish I was old enough to remember you...:(
<Ponies47> Hey Shizuka I noticed your TF2 looks a little diffrent style then the most ours. Did you buy the CD-ROM for the game or somthing?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cachi01|phone: IKR?
<DocSane> Rex_Mundi: That's Japan playing to stereotypes for otaku.
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome who doesnt?
<Moopy> so when is the whole page of bronystate going to be updated to the whole page and stuff?
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Not necessarily true. Take Yokko -- she's certainly not masculine, but she's not the typical female either.
<robotdragon9> ive recently been watching the history of power rangers on TGWTG
<Rex_Mundi> The 90s was an awsome age to live:)
<tSparx> stereotypical*
<Kawaii_icybeauti> lucky to the people that were fortunate enough to grow up in that...
<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: Same here. I need to get back on that.
<lbelmore8> you know a 90s show i like? CatDog idk why
<tSparx> Well, unless you consider being kickass with a rifle to be masculine.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, Ponies47, she's using the FrakenHUD mod?
<cachi01|phone> CatDog is Awesome
<AJIsAwesome> So how many side weapons are accessible to the Pyro?
<Eulshy> I fink the Manmelter is a beter Pyro secondary weapon
<robotdragon9> cool AJIsAwesome
<Rex_Mundi> Never like Catdog, even back then...
<cachi01|phone> I dont liek shizus HUD
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I love all those nick game shows and pokemon of course.
<SpadeMagnes[R> The slime is fucking disgusting
<cachi01|phone> Pokemon season 1-4 <3
<robotdragon9> i was born in '97 so i barely remember the 90's :c
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: What slime?
<Ponies47> SaxyPretender: Could be. :/
<SpadeMagnes[R> in the nickolodeon game shows
<Kawaii_icybeauti> The last region that had a decent show going for it was RBY/S/E
<Rex_Mundi> *born 1990* heck yeah!
<cachi01|phone> robotdragon9 1998 here lol
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Oh yeah.....
<SpadeMagnes[R> the green goop
<Big_Macintosh_1992> robotdragon9: oh well... at least you have 2k to... yeah... 2000's sucked
<lbelmore8> I liked pokemon then it started to suck
<cachi01|phone> ^
<tSparx> There were plenty of good 2000's shows
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Early was okay...9/11 was when everything went downhill
<SpadeMagnes[R> The kanto season had a lot of move errors
<Big_Macintosh_1992> lbelmore8: right around the third batch of pokemon... I lost interest
<SpadeMagnes[R> Like Bulbasaur using whirlwind <.<
*AJIsAwesome doesn't remember the templed themed game show on Nickolodeon...:(
<cachi01|phone> XDDD
<cachi01|phone> LOLWUT XDDDD
<AJIsAwesome> *temple*
<robotdragon9> well im gonna go now see u guys later
<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: Bye!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: I used to watch reruns on Nick GAS. I fell in love with it.
<Rex_Mundi> Cartons started to go down in quality as the 2000s went on, Lunatic unleashed anyone?
<superretroworld> bye robotdragon9
<cachi01|phone> Didnt knew they did bulbasur use whirlwind
<Big_Macintosh_1992> AJIsAwesome: oh... I do... why can't i think of the name...
<cachi01|phone> LOL
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Rex_Mundi: I saw a few of those.
<lbelmore8> Big_Macintosh_1992: G3 FTW!!
<SpadeMagnes[R> The GS pokeball was a wasted plotline
<SpadeMagnes[R> It never got expanded on
<cachi01|phone> Lunatics........ oh yeah i remember those superheroes roght?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Teen titans was my favorite cartoon show of the mid 2000's.
<cachi01|phone> Furry superheroes
<cachi01|phone> ^^
<cachi01|phone> Evil beware
<cachi01|phone> We have waffles
<SpadeMagnes[R> Oh goodie another worthless crate
<lbelmore8> I hated teen titans
<AJIsAwesome> I actually kind of wanted a game where the combat was based off the show, where you could command your pokemon to dodge attacks and perform certain commands.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> What, taras strong was in there...
<Rex_Mundi> But with MLP FIM, Avatar the last airbender, and other awesome shows, i think cartoons are good again, finaly having left the cartoon wasteland of the late 00s. Regular show is cool.
<SpadeMagnes[R> WEEEE
<tSparx> Adventure TIme is a lot of fun too
<cachi01|phone> Regular show and adventure time are awesome
<Big_Macintosh_1992> AJIsAwesome: Oh... its Legends of the Hidden Temple
<AJIsAwesome> What happened to Ibelmore8?
<cachi01|phone> Idl
<cachi01|phone> K
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I also missed toonami...Naruto and samuri jack kicked so much ass.
<Rex_Mundi> Guys remember gargoyles?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Fuck Naruto...

<Ponies47> I WATCHED 5 SECONDS OF THAT GARBAGE AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA PUKE BECAUSE IT WAS SO BAD! :[
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I think I was watching make it or break it and american idol.
<WindWhistler> I found it very interesting how they used all the different types of animation...

<LoGaN> HI!!!!!!!!!

<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: I once tried watching the MLP movie... I diddnt finish. The G1 TV specials are alright though. Havnt seen the actual show yet.
<Reikim> Oookay
<WindWhistler> Oh and of course CGI
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: I FREAKING LOVE Pawn Stars:O
<pony_7007> PSYCH Anyone?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> SpadeMagnes[R: That show is really funny. They really troll people with the prices they give.

<LadyCanary|wubwub> Law & Order SVU ALL DAY ERRYDAY
<Reikim> otakon: Want a spot on the stream game?
<Shizuka> 13still enjoying?
<SpadeMagnes[R> Nothing annoys me more watching Pawn Stars then when people cant take a deal or think they're gonna get alot of poney
*WindWhistler spazzes out on the ground
<LadyCanary|wubwub> Yes indeed Shizuka <3
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Totally!
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Still it's Garbage. Same goes for everything else on Cartoon Network these days :|
<IshNewLaptopPony> You're riding the bus home
<cachi01|phone> U know whats weird?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I was into charmed.
<otakon> Reikim: I'll pass tonight
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Of coarse! :3
<otakon> cachi01|phone: ponies?
<otakon> Shizuka: yes
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Well, to each their own.
<IshNewLaptopPony> A pretty girl walks on
<pony_7007> shawn and gus are the best duo ever
<IshNewLaptopPony> You ignore her and make no interaction, since she's just some stranger who will probably get off in like 5-10 minutes whom you'll never see again
<Barbetos> Yay the server is ded!!
<SpadeMagnes[R> Also apperently Donald Duck is banned in Finland
<cachi01|phone> That edd ed and eddie hasnt even been mentioned in this conversation!
<Barbetos> nope nevermind
<cachi01|phone> THAT SHOW RULED
<LadyCanary|wubwub> D: Nuuu.
<WindWhistler> SpadeMagnes[R: Well that's the funniest thing I've heard all day.
<lbelmore8> my brothers name is logan
<SpadeMagnes[R> Because he doesnt wear pants
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cachi01|phone: Oh you're right. I loved that one.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: Because he doesn't wear pants, right?
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: ma steam crashed
<WindWhistler> I knew it
<IshNewLaptopPony> But then she gets off at the same stop as you and walks along the same path
<superretroworld> cachi01|phone: they shouuld be banned, for saying 'canadians are weird'
<cachi01|phone> Coltown
<SpadeMagnes[R> Why that is even a issue I dont get
<IshNewLaptopPony> You keep your distance from her and try your best not to look like a stalker until you reach your destination, and again no interaction
<cachi01|phone> superretroworld lol
<IshNewLaptopPony> A couple days later, you take the bus home again and she gets on, again
<WindWhistler> SpadeMagnes[R: The same reason they banned a book because two male penguins tried to hatch an egg
<Rex_Mundi> tSparx: You should checkout 'escape for midnight castle', for an 80s cartoon its alright. Its certainly interesting watching 80s ponies getting draged away screaming by their necks...
<WindWhistler> "It offended someone"
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R: I don't know. The same reason "Loser" is censored in the Canadian version of MLP.
<lbelmore8> i think this is the longest bronystate topic ive seen
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Rex_Mundi: And dont forget the sea ponies!
<IshNewLaptopPony> you notice she glances at you for a nanosecond and smiles then looks away
<LadyCanary|wubwub> GO SHIZU GO <3
<Unnr> I liked "A Very Minty Christmas" But then again <3 Minty
<SpadeMagnes[R> How is loser offensive?
<IshNewLaptopPony> Once again same thing as before, no interaction and ignore her
<Rex_Mundi> Unnr: that G3 ponies...
<SpadeMagnes[R> God people are oversensitive these days
<AJIsAwesome> HUZZAH! THE PYRO HAS BEEN DOUBLED!
<Ponies47> I hate Regular Show, Gumball, The Looney Tunes Show, Tom and Jerry Tales, Adventur Time, Annoying Orange, AND ALL THE OTHER JUNK THAT THEY HAVE THAT THEY CALL CARTOONS! :[
<Unnr> Rex_Mundi: But, but minty is luff
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Unnr: I have a minty toy in my room from childhood.
<WindWhistler> That guy who wrote Fahrenheit 451 had the right idea
<IshNewLaptopPony> Then it happens a third time
<WindWhistler> Something offends someone? Burn it.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Calm down, take it easy.:S
<Rex_Mundi> Kawaii_icybeauti: Oh yes, one WTF monont indeed.
<superretroworld> well now its time to say it, canadians are weird
<IshNewLaptopPony> So what do you do now
<tSparx> SpadeMagnes[R: It's the price we pay for having been undersensitive in the past. We'll level out to proper levels of sensitivity at some point.
<Unnr> Kawaii_icybeauti: See! Also minty was the original Luna in Socks
<IshNewLaptopPony> Do you A)Attempt to make interaction this time and try to befriend her
*Ponies47 Flips a table
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 annoying orange show is junk but man DABUQ IS WRONG WITH U. All those shows are amazing!
<LadyCanary|wubwub> GO SHIZU! <3
<IshNewLaptopPony> B)Continue to make no interaction and not seem like a creep
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Unnr: They should shove a minty in the backround.
<tSparx> You hate the Regular Show *and* Adventure Time?
<IshNewLaptopPony> or C) Hey I just met you, I know it's crazy, but heres my number, so call me maybe
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: To each their own, guys.
*tSparx flips a table right back at you!
<Rex_Mundi> Unnr: You watched the Poney pokey video about watching G3, didnt you?
<WindWhistler> Burn ALL the offensive stuff
<tSparx> :P
<Unnr> Kawaii_icybeauti: S3's Derpy Sighting would be amazing to switch to Minty
<DocSane> Okay, I'm gonna watch The Daily for the first time in weeks. Later, all.
