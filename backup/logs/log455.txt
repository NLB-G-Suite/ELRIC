<OtakuTom> There is one type of bug I like...video game bugs...like the one in Big Rigs (considered to be one of the worst games ever made) where there's no limit to the amount of acceleration you can get when going in reverse, causing you to be able to go in reverse at millions, and even billions, of miles per hour. (Yea, I know...kinda off topic by now after the change to diamonds :P)

<Ponies47> Hey hey hey pony_911
<crazypony> hi pony_911
<MahBoi777> hey pony_911
<Monfang> I'm not sure if this documentory will explain, but I hope everyone understands that the choice to drop the bomb wasn't one made lightly. If the US Military wasn't certaint that Japan would have fought with every man, woman and child to drive our troops back using suicide tactics, they would have never had done this.
<Ninjazz> ^
<Shizuka> 13the main effect it had, iirc, was to scare hirohito into calling off the generals
<pony_911> they had it coming
<Ponies47> AHH! I'M SO BORED! (Slides across floor)
<Monfang> And be thankful that they never called our bluff on a third bomb
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Monfang> We didn't have it
<Ninjazz> mhmm
<MahBoi777> I bet it wasn't an easy decision
<Shizuka> 13anyway... sleep time for me

<MahBoi777> awwwww shit AMERICA
<Ponies47> pony_911: Why would I do that?
<pony_911> because you're bored
<Monfang> One of the major things I don't like about the end of WW2 is that the US made it illegal for Japan to rebuild it's own army. They found a way around it, but it lead to private ownership of guns to be illegal in Japan. (based on my research)
<Ponies47> pony_911 ewwwwwww
<Ninjazz> I can think of only one other pony that licks herself .
<Ponies47> :O
<Ponies47> who?
<MahBoi777> better safe than sorry Monfang
<Ninjazz> You don't wanna know.
<Monfang> People should be allowed to defend themselves however they wish, MahBoi777
<Ponies47> okie.....doki.....loki
<pony_911> and next the cold war ......then the vietnam war then the korean war.....america just love wars doesnt it
<OtakuTom> Honestly, I kinda wish private ownership of guns was illegal in the US, too, but I'd rather not get into that debate here.
<Ponies47> ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZ
<Monfang> Pony_911, what about other countries?

<Phase4> hen3ry, even if it did i doubt the atmosphere would sustain combustion
<hen3ry> exactly, there's no gravity. Earth just sucks
*Tovler will celebrate by watching good old American television.
<MahBoi777> yea, igniting the atmosphere wud SUCK
<Ponies47> *Flys around chat*
<Tovler> igniting the sunlight seems more plausible
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<pony_911> hit
<hen3ry> Phase4: Oxygen + fuel = fire. Plenty of fuel on the ground if the air had maintained superheated status. Fortunately we have JUST enough Argon in our atmosphere.
<Ninjazz> I'm not exactly sure where they got the idea the atmosphere would combust. :S
<Monfang> Bet you can't do that again, Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You can't ignite radiation.
<pony_911> the friendship cannon is more powerful
<Ponies47> AAAH YEAH!
<Phase4> hen3ry, what is in the air that can combust?
<MahBoi777> I don't know much about radiation,
<Ponies47> Love is...
<Monfang> Carbon?
<Monfang> Helium?
<Monfang> Hydrogen?
<hen3ry> nitrogen could. But it was mainly the concern that you get it hot enough, the surface burns and the atmosphere sustains it.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<Bluestrom_S> good night everyone
<SparklyWaffles> *pokes Ponies47 with a stick* boom.
<Monfang> It is true! You can explode twice!
<MahBoi777> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oxygen can combust
<Ponies47> Night Bluestrom_S
<Tovler> Texas is running out of helium.
<pony_911> huhhhhhh........america and china looks like about to go to war with each other
<Sumica> 00,10Nitt,s just showing this so he can emote that over and over
<MahBoi777> yup oxygen
<Ninjazz> lol
<Monfang> Pony_911, what point are you trying to make?
<Ponies47> SparklyWaffles: Yay!
<Tovler> if you call a "trade war" a war.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love explosions.
<pony_911> no military stuff
<MahBoi777> Michael Bay approves
<SparklyWaffles> *throws a muffin at MahBoi777*
<Phase4> this is incredible footage that i realy hope never needs to be repeated
<Monfang> And what makes you think that is going to happen, pony_911?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and that's how spongebob was made ~
<hen3ry> think of all the deaf whales...
<Tovler> China is trying to build a monopoly on green tech.
<MahBoi777> MUFFIN
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_> *explodes*
<Ninjazz> I wonder if we'll ever find something worse than nukes...
<Monfang> Fission bombs?
<Monfang> Fusion Bombs?
<Monfang> Dark Matter Bombs
<MahBoi777> slipspace bombs
<hen3ry> H-bomb is fusion
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Anti-matter bombs ?
<Phase4> Ninjazz, we probably will
<Ninjazz> Indeed. :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Anti-matter weapons maybe.
<Midnight_Tempest> Quantum Torpedoes...
<Monfang> Black Hole bombs
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Rain nukes ?
<hen3ry> depends what you consider "worse" though in that case. A-bomb = more residual radiation. H-bomb = bigger, more destructive blast
<Phase4> it probably would be anti-matter
<MahBoi777> and it will probably end up destroying us
<GabeMoist> Anti-matter weapons are the future
<Tovler> Neutron Bomb?
<Ninjazz> Over all effect.
<hen3ry> neutron bomb = everything ded, buildings intact
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Neutron bombs are a type of nuclear weapon.
<Monfang> So who's hungry?
<SparklyWaffles> *bites Midnight_Temptest*
<TheRandomkid321> TheRandomkid321 here and todays random quation is. What if the maker of my little pony inetended it to be humans but was really bad at drawing?
<MahBoi777> I'm Hungry!
<GabeMoist> We have salted nuclear weapons
<SparklyWaffles> I'M HUNGRY!
<Phase4> bigger fusion boms are the most immediate concern though, it would not be too hard to double the yeild of a 'fat man'
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01High radiation; low-yield.
<Midnight_Tempest> is this... learning videos?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<OtakuTom> Someone out there will create the Z-bomb...a bio weapon that causes mass death whlie keeping most structures intact, but causing the dead to be reborn as zombies, thus starting the zombie appocalypse.
<Monfang> It's a documentory
<hen3ry> we actually reached a limit on fusion bombs. Get them too powerful, and they simply vent atmosphere into space
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You are learning things.
<MahBoi777> ur the best at explosions
<Midnight_Tempest> NOOO! LEARNING!!
<Phase4> Midnight_Tempest, BE EDUCATED
<Sumica> 00,10dont realy need much to make an antimater bomb
*GabeMoist drops a cobalt bomb on bronystate
<TheRandomkid321> And here I have used up 60% of the comments space in a flame war http://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=AA9N_Hz5_lc
<Phase4> hen3ry, interesting
<SparklyWaffles> *boops Monfang*
<Midnight_Tempest> I DUN WANNA BE EDUMACATED!

<GabeMoist> What about slated anti-matter bombs?
<Dshannon> wait
<GabeMoist> *salted
<SparklyWaffles> LEARN ALL THE THINGS!

<Phase4> Ponies47, TWILIGHT IS DISAPOINT
<Dshannon> (:
<Dshannon> that's better
<Ninjazz> I live on an island. Near those ones too. :c
*Nittany_Discord 11,01spends
<TheRandomkid321> so its a nuclear bomb test site?
<Tovler> been over 2 days and Pandora's Pinata still isn't on iTunes. Oh well, yar har fiddlee dee..
<pony_911> what mankini island?
<Ponies47> Phase4: I ALSO HATE BOOKS! :[
<GabeMoist> pretty
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<Monfang> nice sunrise
<Phase4> Ponies47, D:
<pony_911> i hates book too yay
<Monfang> oh wait

<Midnight_Tempest> im learning SECRETS!
<TheRandomkid321> Wow. Fallout got it all worng
<Midnight_Tempest> fallout is just a game, its all fiction
<MahBoi777> no Midnight_Tempest, play with ur epic knives instead lol
<pony_911> Phase4_ yeah.....right
<Sumica> 00,10oh does this talk about the atomic hand grenade?
<Ponies47> Phase4: Ponies are silly filly. PONIES!
<hen3ry> rocketry wasn't a mature science yet. that's really what the space race was about...
*twilight_sprinkler leaves unnoticed
<Phase4_> fallout gets a lot wrong but tech is hardly the point
<GabeMoist> Sumica, we have atomic handgrenades?
*Ninjazz waves at twilight_sprinkler
<MahBoi777> bye twilight_sprinkler!
<Sumica> 00,10no GabeMoist but they did toy around with the idea
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4_ IMPOSTAR!
*Midnight_Tempest points at twilight_sprinkler 'WE GOT A RUNNER!'
<pony_911> i have a fart-in-a-jar grenade
<GabeMoist> Californium Hand Grenades
<Phase4_> TheRandomkid321: you were saying?
<Phase4_> :P
<Ponies47> BUCK DIS! I'M GOING TO BED! :[ GOODNIGHT EVERYPONY!
<TheRandomkid321> ...
<Phase4_> night Ponies47
<MahBoi777> gnight Ponies47
<pony_911> oh ....its you
<SparklyWaffles> GOODNIGHT Ponies47!
<Ninjazz> Go to bed, Ponies47.
*Phase4_ hugs TheRandomkid321
<Sumica> 00,10the problem was any thing light enough to throw was too thinkly shielded for the health of the user and well blast range was further then teh throw range
<ACS13123> Night Ponies47
*TheRandomkid321 Kicks Phase4_ off
<MahBoi777> pony_911: saints row much? lol
*Phase4_ hugs TheRandomkid321 harder
<SparklyWaffles> Rejected.
<hen3ry> we do have atomic artillery shells, though
<Ponies47> Besides it's past 1:00 AM and I got school :P
<SparklyWaffles> SURPRISE HUG ATTACK
<TheRandomkid321> HELP!
<pony_911> yes but i have a REAL one
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ponies47> OK BYE! *Flys outta chat*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You couldn't make nuclear weapons small enough to fit into a hand grenade.
<pony_911> wanna test it?
<TheRandomkid321> War is srs buisnss
<MahBoi777> holy hand grenades lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, a dumb idea since it's suicidal to throw one.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even salted.
<Monfang> Can you make a nuclear reactor small enough ot fit in a backpack?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno.
<Phase4_> Monfang: not one you can survive carrying
<pony_911> mabey
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but once again the weaight of the object
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Depends on if you can get enough fissionable material in there.
<Monfang> If you can, then Power Armors are in the future
<Phase4_> too much radiation
<pony_911> in the FUTURE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Sumica has a point.
<hen3ry> reactor, no. Bomb, yes. For a big backpack anyway
<Midnight_Tempest> we probably will have nuclear reactors tiny enough in about... 2-3 centuries...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because nuclear materials are heavy.
<Phase4_> BUT you could use a low power nuclear battery, but they are exactly that. low power
<pony_911> all like ghost recon and shit
<Monfang> The mechancis of the power armor could eleminate the worry about the weight
<Sumica> 00,10any thing light enough to be carryable would leak radiation
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<TheRandomkid321> brb
<Sumica> 00,10and well coolent
<Phase4_> Nittany_Discord: you keep using that word, i do not think it meens what you think it meens
<Sumica> 00,10water is heavy
<Midnight_Tempest> 1kiloton nuke? wow... weak...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know what heavy means.
<Phase4_> D
<MahBoi777> .....well I wouldn't want one falling on me
<Phase4_> XD'
<Monfang> It was meant to be very specific, Midnight_Tempist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Heavy elements are ones with high atomic numbers.
<Phase4_> Nittany_Discord: i ment explodes
<sub06905> ello everypony
<MahBoi777> hey sub06905
<pony_911> nuclear is fun !!!
<GabeMoist> Einsteinium is heavy
*Nittany_Discord 11,01attaches to Phase4_ and explodes
<Phase4_> O_O
<pony_911> ded
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Only you take it the wrong way.
<MahBoi777> lol
<sub06905> are we watching something aboot explosions
<MahBoi777> yup
*Nittany_Discord 11,01boosts
<hen3ry> The W48 atomic artillery shell weighed about 120 pounds, only 33 inches long. One of smallest nuclear "bombs" ever to exist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Note: Not a fusion bomb.
<Sumica> 00,10they should use some naquada on a nuke
<hen3ry> yield was only 72 tons, though
<Midnight_Tempest> dat stargate ref
<MahBoi777> I've never heard of a fusion bomb
*Nittany_Discord 11,01boosts
<Monfang> An't that a pretty sunrise!
<Monfang> Oh wait
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oops.
<hen3ry> ded
<Phase4|Exploded> MahBoi777: h-bombs are fusion
<Midnight_Tempest> and everyone got a tan
<GabeMoist> Fusion bomb uses Nuclear Fusion
<MahBoi777> oh
<Monfang> "Someone pass the popcorn"
<Monfang> There needs to be a Rifftax on this documentory
*MahBoi777 passes popcorn to Monfang
<pony_911> yeah but now NATO is building its anti-nuclear shield
<Sumica> 00,10Nuke testing killed John Wayne
<Monfang> Pony_911: And?
<TrixieMuffin> directly or slowly ?
<ACS13123> inb4 its a bedtime story :D
<MahBoi777> say your prayers Pilgrim
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So first attempt at an h-bomb.
<pony_911> i dont know? will it work?
<Monfang> I hope so
<hen3ry> everyone will be ded. Except Austrailia.
<Monfang> I hope it never gets tested
<TrixieMuffin> but will it blend ?
<Phase4|Exploded> Fun fact: the internet was originaly designed to be nuke proof
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Australia will be like WTF-mate.
<Midnight_Tempest> russians had biggest H-Bomb... the Tzar
<pony_911> it will be finish in uh...2020
<TheRandomkid321> hen3ry AW SHIT AUSTRALIA!
<Phase4|Exploded> Nittany_Discord: ikr
<Sumica> 00,10it's not a nuke shield it's a missle shield
<BronyJenkins> Fun fact: This fact is not fun.
<hen3ry> but they'll be ded soon. f[buy some apples] kangaroos.
<Phase4|Exploded> hen3ry: /)
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<hen3ry> (\
<Midnight_Tempest> BEEEEEWWWWWMMMMMMMMM
<MahBoi777> a nuke shield wud have to be some sort of Biodome
<Sumica> 00,10and realy nukes can be transported by things other then missles
<ACS13123> (\:)/) anyone?
<pony_911> @Sumica yes but isnt nuclear warheads are built in missle?
<TheRandomkid321> MahBoi777 Im good with any biodome. as long as paulie shore is left at least 20,000 yards away from it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<sub06905> no imagine if we had these bombs in the times of Napoleon Bonapart
<TrixieMuffin> (\
<sub06905> now*
<hen3ry> there are such things as atomic shells, fired from cannons
<Monfang> I have a feeling pony_911 is confusing anti-nuke defences such as intercepter missles and jets that can shoot them out of the sky with a 'shield'.
<MahBoi777> TheRandomkid321: Lol
<Sumica> 00,10warheads are installed on missles the device it self is self contained
<hen3ry> the missile is just a way to get the bomb part to its target.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aircraft-deliverable bombs existed. Also nuclear-tipped torpedoes for subs.
<pony_911> Monfang lack of words :P
<hen3ry> The USS Essess?
<BronyJenkins> Anyway. I'm off now. CYa everypony.

<Monfang> Give him the C.S. Lewis quote, TheRandomkid321
<sub06905> men*
<TheRandomkid321> ACS13123 I already have. Now all he has to do. Is stop giving me food.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You shouldn't have looked.
<hen3ry> hazmat suits are meant to protect against environmental toxins. they work... but they're not gonna protect you from kaboom
*Midnight_Tempest rolls on the ground holding his eyes.

<sub06905> wow best firework ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People got super-swollen limbs and super-cancer from nukes.
<TheRandomkid321> Mofang which one?
<hen3ry> there are three main kinds of radiation, alpha beta and gamma. alpha can be stopped by a piece of paper, gamma requires miles of lead
<YamaTHou> Hi everyone
<Monfang> http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/84171
<TheRandomkid321> AHH!
<MahBoi777> hen3ry: so they CAN keep certain levels/types of radiation out?
<TheRandomkid321> Creepster lyra
<YamaTHou> one the most funniest things I seen so far XD http://mrbastoff.deviantart.com/art/A-Hoof-in-the-Boot-302325192
<hen3ry> sure. but then, a t-shirt could protect you from alpha.
<YamaTHou> one of the*
<MahBoi777> ah
<hen3ry> best you can do in clothing is have decent beta protection.
<Midnight_Tempest> upshot-knothole? dumb name
<hen3ry> no clothes will protect you from gamma
<hen3ry> but gamma doesn't stick around much either, so...

<sub06905> mah xbox has been alive for 3 years :)
<Monfang> Midnight_Tempest: Send me your XBox
<MahBoi777> what's the range?
<Midnight_Tempest> Castle Bravo was the largest H-Bomb detonated by the US... the Russians did a larger one...
<Phase4|Exploded> sub06905: mine was probably that old when it died (second hand)
<hen3ry> yeah, Ruskies did a 50 megaton one. And they scaled it back.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fact: Castle Bravo was larger than predicted because of the unexpected fusion of Lithium-3 (I think).
<hen3ry> they intended to go 100 megaton
<Ninjazz> Correct, Nittany_Discord.
<TheRandomkid321> ASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Speaking of Tsar Bomba, this movie has very little footage of it.

<MelaPonie> only took like 17 weeks or so
<MelaPonie> to make that
<MelaPonie> from scratch
<Phase4|Exploded> 57 Megatons is a lot of energy
<Midnight_Tempest> the blast circled the earth 3 times
<Ninjazz> Scaled down?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> VioletGreySha: o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.

*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hands VioletGreySha a cookie
<MelaPonie> it wasn't rly scaled down
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny. I think Tsar Bomba was a "clean" bomb.
<hen3ry> it was. one of the cleanest ever
*VioletGreySha noms teh cookie from Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Ninjazz> What was "clean" about it?
<MelaPonie> they just replaced the uranium tampers with lead
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Low-radiation.
<hen3ry> very little radioactive fallout
<MelaPonie> like 99% of the power was from fusion
<hen3ry> especially compared to the yield
<Midnight_Tempest> high destructive power but very little radiation
<MelaPonie> very low fission yeild
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> VioletGreySha: lol jks it has coffee in it
<Midnight_Tempest> it was impressive
<Phase4|Exploded> fusion emmits very little radiation
<MelaPonie> that was because
<VioletGreySha> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: oh now now i only get more sleepy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's actually a lot less MelaPonie
<sub06905> nugget?
<MelaPonie> they replaced the uranium tampers on the secondary and tertiary stages with lead
<Phase4|Exploded> and the waste material from fusion (spesificly deterium/tritium fusion) is helium

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Contribution of fusion to thermonuclear explosions.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's like 30%+ off of the top of my head.
<MelaPonie> Ninjazz, it depends on the design of the bomb
<Midnight_Tempest> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nah man... Alicorn's are all OP...
<Ninjazz> :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it's not 99%
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Liek A BAwss
<MahBoi777> O_o
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> MahBoi777: iz http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/b/e/be922_ORIG-u_jelly.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With Teller-Ulam devices, a lot of the energy comes from the detonation of the secondary tamper (if it is Uranium).
<MelaPonie> Nittany_Discord, with Tsar Bomba
<MelaPonie> and ur right
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> VioletGreySha: http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/b/e/be922_ORIG-u_jelly.jpg
<MelaPonie> 97% of the yeild was from fusion
<MelaPonie> only 3% of it was from fission
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With Tsar Bomba?
<VioletGreySha> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: no iam not atm :P
<Midnight_Tempest> dem chinese
<hen3ry> New Player has entered the gaem!
<Ninjazz> New challenger has arrived!
<MelaPonie> Nittany_Discord, you're correct on fast fission of the secondary and tirtiary tampers
<MahBoi777> lol
<MelaPonie> but with Tsar Bomba the tampers were lead
<MelaPonie> not uranium
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<MelaPonie> hence no fast fission
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> MahBoi777: bitches love alicorns
<MelaPonie> and the scaled back yeild
<MelaPonie> only 3% of the yeild was from fission
<hen3ry> Then China got the bomb, but have no fears; they can't wipe us out for at least five years.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If it was Uranium, they would have had the 100MT version on their hands.
<MelaPonie> and that was from the primary
<MelaPonie> yup
<Ninjazz> lol dat horse gas mask
<Midnight_Tempest> then suddenly Error 37, nuke doesnt work
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes

<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64|AFK is bored
<mario_pony1> yaay~
<CrimsonPhoenix> ugh....that interface
<Blazang> From what I can tell so far, there is no reason for grunty to be in this game other than to just have some incompetent villian for us to laugh at
<mario_pony> woo!
<Brony123> ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> remember when the xbox had folders as the interface?
<Blazang> In the prebious games she was an actual villian important to the plot.
<Blazang> She kidnaps the sister in first one and she was gonna get revived in the second
<mario_pony> lol you said plot
<Brony123> ...
<Blazang> huhuh, I did, that was cool uhuhuh

<Brony123> Does anyone here remember or know of Rayman? For the N64?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Hello all

<Brony123> Yeah, good game.
<MahBoi777> hello RainbowcrashNBurn
<mario_pony> those nymphs
<Blazang> I played the first one on the PS1 as well. i remember it was ard
<mario_pony> Betilla
<Blazang> *hard
<Evil_Spike> I played Rayman for PS1. It was brutal
<Brony123> Rayman Orgins is coming to the 3DS this summer, I'll be looking for that one.
<Renard> Yum, Rayman
<Blazang> I will admit 1 thing for this game, building your own car looks fun
<Renard> Played it on Saturn
<mario_pony> lol
<Brony123> What about Glover? You ever hear of Glover?
<Renard> and Rayman 2 on Dreamcast
<Blazang> Oh no I havent
<Brony123> Its wasn't that good.
<mario_pony> my eyelids feel..heavy
<Brony123> You played as a glove rolling around on a ball.
<Brony123> ._.
<mario_pony> i should probably get atleast 6 ours of sleep

<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02i liek poniez ^-^
<Blazang> Mah nigga
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Watch your language Blazang
<Blazang> my bad :D
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane slaps Blazang
<Blazang> Oh sh- Bayonetta, this game was cool
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> any1 else confused to how cadence is related to celestia?
<Brony123> SEGA.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> cause apparentley cadence is celestias niece
<Renard> The PS3 port is atroucious
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> therefore meaning shes lunas daughter but i have not a clue
<Renard> I did not believe it at first. Then, I tried it. :<
<Blazang> Blueblood is celestia nephew too. i assume it's the same thing wiht him, very distant
<Blazang> Like great great great and son
<Blazang> *so on
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02This is the back story of Sarah Palin
<Brony123> e.o
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> whose blue blood again
<Evil_Spike> Time to play Binding of Isaac
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> is he that jackarse in galloping gala?
<Blazang> My preferred weapon set for this game was the sword and two shotguns on the legs
<Blazang> Yes
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> so who is cadence's mum?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> im think logically luna
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> but idk
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64|AFK DOING BAYONETTA?
<Blazang> Dunno, it's irrelevant. no it not luna
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> or celestia has another sister
<CrimsonPhoenix> HOLY MOTHER OF CELESTIA ALLMIGHTY
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Blazang: just curious dat is all
<Brony123> "I don't get it."
<Blazang> That's my speculation anyway.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64|AFK: I HOPE YOU KNOW THEM COMBOS
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause this is going to be a loooooooooooooong ride
<Brony123> Well, I got some work to do, I'm working on a remix.
<Blazang> Luna was in the moon for 1000 and I doubt she's had a kid since the time she's come back, Cadance certainly doesnt appear to be over a millenia old
<Brony123> I'll be back later.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> omg my internet is sooo laggy atm :S
<Brony123> Cya everypony
<Blazang> nighty
<CrimsonPhoenix> Puzzke time :$
<Malavolent> Ello there, everypony.

<Renard> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesworth.soundboard.mlpfim
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> so a unknown sis of celestia
<Renard> Ohhh yeeeaaah
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> and allso
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> cause they put the ring on their horns
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> where do they put it for pegasi and Land Ponies?
<Blazang> A distant niece I think. Like a great(x29 or whater) grand neice
<OtakuTom> Oh man...I haven't played Bayonetta in a long time...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Blazang: k lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bored -.-
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> OtakuTom: hows ur wedding coming along
<CrimsonPhoenix> lol SuperBrony64
<Blazang> OtakuTom What was your favorite weapon set?
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hands SuperBrony64 a cookie
<CrimsonPhoenix> This game is too complicated it seems
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> DuskStarshimmer:
<OtakuTom> Still 17 months away...haven't really done anything major yet with it.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Family Guy is ending?

<Phase4> ohai XAX
<Kandarihu> So, about last night. Did Nittany_Discord play anything other than SAW?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: stream please?
<Chrysalis> Alicorn_Prince_Shane phase is a tech not a mod
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Chrysalis: hes streamed b4
<XAX> Phase4: If you were going to, I'd play something with you if I were in bed. Maybe tomorrow?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> he has permission to stream Chrysalis silly changling
<XAX> Doesent matter if it's streaming or not. I just wanna play something with ya :D
<Kandarihu> Phase has streamed before.
<Chrysalis> XAX that sounds dirty :P
<XAX> If I WERENT in bed
<XAX> sigh
<Phase4> XD
<Chrysalis> what a choice of EQD post...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> XAX: is dirty child
<XAX> D: didn't mean to
<XAX> :p
<Phase4> currently i'm fighting mysql
<Phase4> doesnt seem to want to work
<[web]JRP2234> http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Squjd49oMZ
<XAX> Phase4: Go at it. Slaughter it like a dog. Make it call you master.
<[web]JRP2234> http://vocaroo.com/i/s0maBiSMtRR0
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: dont feel like streaming?
<XAX> I'm beginning my very first lessons in coding at school after we're done with game design. I think we're learning HTML...
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hello, dead chat. May I take this seat.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hi XAX, btw.
*Ninjazz|Depressed sits in seat
<Chrysalis> XAX, coding + html is not something that should EVER be said
<Phase4> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, little busy to stream
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: no worries man
<XAX> Chrysalis: Sorry. Shows how newfag I a
<XAX> am*
<Chrysalis> no probs :P
<Chrysalis> go for c++ if your going for games
<XAX> Chrysalis: We doing
<XAX> DAMNIT
<[web]JRP2234> funfact ios is written in c++
<Nerom> Morning everypony
<Phase4> "120522 7:21:27 [ERROR] Binlog has bad magic number;" gee thanks mysqlk
<Phase4> mysql'
<Chrysalis> fun fact, all major systems that rely on speed are based on c/c++
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hello Nerom.
<Phase4> XAX, if you want to learn how to program, start with something like python
<XAX> fucking Send button is right below Backspace button. Anyway, our whole class is doing a Game Design project in Game Maker...
<Chrysalis> oh god not python
<Chrysalis> that puts you in SO many bad habbits
<Chrysalis> go for c# and XNA
<XAX> Phase4: We're doing python at some point this year too, I think...
<Phase4> Chrysalis, well its that or pascal, anything else either has too many concepts (like c# ) or is evil
<[web]JRP2234> coding is easy....the challenge is all the shit that gets in ur way
<Phase4> pascal is just bad, not quite evil
<[web]JRP2234> eg erros
<[web]JRP2234> errors*
<Chrysalis> Errors are your mistakes in coding
<[web]JRP2234> eg bugs
<Chrysalis> can't be that easy if enough are getting in your way
<Phase4> Creating code = easy, Debugging code = little bit harder, Reading someone elses code = 80% of your time
<Chrysalis> bugs arnt errors thoguh
<Chrysalis> hiya Ghosties
<XAX> I can't choose what I do. It's already set what im going to learn this year. I am only 15 :(
<Phase4> ohai Ghosties
<[web]JRP2234> gasp
<Ghosties> 04Hello~
<XAX> What Chrysalis and Phase4 said
<Nerom> ^
<Ghosties> 04How is everyone tonight/today?
<XAX> Fine :>
<Chrysalis> Phase4 try debugging multi-threaded networking code then say its a "little bit harder"
<Ghosties> 04That's good
<Nerom> Great
<XAX> Ghosties: Did your computer turn out to be perfectly fine?
<Ghosties> 04Even better, Nerom :D
<Chrysalis> Ghosties i'm good and yourself?
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Hey, Ghosties.
<Nerom> Ikr :P
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, my comp's fine XAX. Thanks for asking
<Ghosties> 04I'm doing alright, a little tired but fine
<XAX> Ghosties: That's good to hear :)
<Ghosties> 04Hello Ninjazz
<XAX> Ninjazz|Depressed: What's got you feeling down again? :(
<Ninjazz|Depressed> XAX: Week's been hard on me.
<XAX> Damn.
<[web]JRP2234> life has been a bitch to me
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Finally caught up with me, I guess.
<Nerom> Ghosties try sleeping 2h and then go up and do a driving leason in an hour :P Now thats the fun I will have soon
<Phase4> Chrysalis, ever tried debugging nodejs?
<XAX> Nerom: Oh god good luck
<Nerom> Yea thanks XAX
<Nerom> I will need it... And 2 cups of coffiee
*Chrysalis hasnt heard of it, googles, throws up at the definition
<Ghosties> 04You should have gotten more sleep :P
<Chrysalis> server side javascript
<Chrysalis> my brain. it cannot handle that.
<Phase4> Chrysalis, javascript is great imho, but for some reason stack traces are lost in events
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Sleeps sounds good.
<Chrysalis> javascript is interperated, its too damn slow
<Ghosties> 04Hell yeah it does, I can hear my bed calling me now *yawn*
<Chrysalis> that stuff should NEVER touch a server
<Phase4> so you will have an application just insta die for no aparent reason with the cause detatched from the problem
<Nerom> Yea should but have a bad case of insomnia was up to 8 this morning and woke up by 10 now its 12 :S
<XAX> Ghosties: Time?
<Phase4> Chrysalis, its not interpreted, V8 js engine has a jit
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Heading to it, Ghosties?
<Ghosties> 04Here? It's 6:20 AM here
<Ghosties> 04Not yet
<[web]JRP2234> Phase4: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0iSpIkHet3a
<Chrysalis> still slower than a compiled language
<Phase4> Chrysalis, fun fact: javascript is now faster than php
<XAX> Did you just wake up, or have you been up all night?
<Ghosties> 04I wanted to see how you guys were doing and mayyyyyyyyyyyyyybe play something
<Chrysalis> who still uses PHP?
<Ghosties> 04I've been up all night
<Phase4> Chrysalis, far too many people
<XAX> Damn :o
<Chrysalis> ooh what you gonna play Ghosties?
<Nerom> Neat Ghosties that was the time i tried to sleep at but it was to bright to
<Ninjazz|Depressed> A Ghosties stream?!
<Phase4> [web]JRP2234, MY EARS
<Phase4> Y U DO THAT
<Chrysalis> Phase4 too true, too true
<Ascendant> ohaidere
<Ghosties> 04Whoa, 81 people...that's the lowest I've seen it
<Ghosties> 04Well, recently that is
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Lowest today I saw was 79
<Ghosties> 04I'm not sure, Chrysalis
<[web]JRP2234> inb4 chat is very dead
<Phase4> it was 63 yesterday
<Kandarihu> I see 99
<Chrysalis> yeah, balnket keeps seem to be dropping the numbers
<XAX> Phase4: lord :I
<junh1024-XD> inb4 Denial, not just a river in Egypt
<Phase4> though the lowest i've technicaly seen is 8 during a netsplit
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Doesn't count. :P
<Ghosties> 04I have my eye on a few things: Saints Row The Third, Spore, Terraria, Fallout New Vegas and Morrowind are my top picks right now
<Phase4> it was a bad split
<Nerom> Well Not been here much these couple of weeks after the final of S2 but it was usualy this low by this time in the week
<Chrysalis> ooh if you play saints row i could join you :P
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Terraria sounds good.
<drfsupercenter> 03hi Ascendant
<Phase4> but thats what happens when you name the servers 'celestia' and 'discord'
<Ghosties> 04And sorry Ninjazz, but I won't be streaming for a while :P
<[web]JRP2234> Jackolen BOWLLL
<XAX> Ghosties: Saints row the third. Oh god, that game. SO entertaining
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Ahhh, oh well. :$
<Nerom> Hey somepony host a terraria servr
<Ascendant> ohia
<Ascendant> ohai
<drfsupercenter> 03gooood I have no idea what I'm supposed to write
<Ghosties> 04Saints Row 2 is much better in my opinion, but The Third has its moments
<drfsupercenter> 03for this stupid paper
<drfsupercenter> 03gotta do it in an hour and a half or so
<Ascendant> ._.
<Ascendant> you can do it
<drfsupercenter> 03gotta be 500 words, too
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Both games are great.
<drfsupercenter> 03there's only so much I can BS
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I loved em both.
<junh1024-XD> last minuite charlie
<Chrysalis> SR3, fun fact, they had to change the penetrator in japan to be solid because floppy was too offensive
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah so far I haven't slept all night and I can't at this point
<Flareon> hm
<Ascendant> I wrote a 1200-word essay in 2 hours
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah shut up LOL
<Ascendant> you can do 500
<drfsupercenter> 03want to help
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ascendant> ohai Flareon
<Ascendant> hm
<Ghosties> 04Haha
<Flareon> 500 is nothing :P
<Ghosties> 04Neat
<Nerom> LOl
<Ninjazz|Depressed> I loled.
<Ascendant> I'll write it for you if you buy me some games
*Ascendant runs
<Ascendant> nah
<drfsupercenter> 03What is The Growth Machine? In the New Orleans area before Katrina, how did it relate to the political system at local and national levels? How did/does it relate to social structure? What effect did that link have on the natural and man-made environments?
<Ascendant> kidding
<drfsupercenter> 03I would,a ctually
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<Ascendant> hurrrrrrr
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm googling stuff, right
*XAX has never played the first or second Saints Row, and has only played the third one because a mate tormented it.
<drfsupercenter> 03so far I have
<drfsupercenter> 03The Growth Machine is a name given uncoordinated economic growth. The idea is that cities are containers for human actions, and as such, humans would compete for the most strategic areas of land.
<drfsupercenter> 03reworded from wikipedia
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Ascendant> lmao
<XAX> TORRENTED
<Chrysalis> tormented it?
<Ascendant> 500 words is easy
<Espeon> o.o
<Ascendant> I suppose I could help you
<Chrysalis> you should be ashamed
<drfsupercenter> 03that's like 50
<drfsupercenter> 03xD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Flareon> learn to bullshit :P
<drfsupercenter> 03...woah
<Ascendant> though I have no idea what the hell The Grow Machine is
<Nerom> Torment games now thats skills needed
<drfsupercenter> 03why did that not get blocked
<Ascendant> yeah Flareon
<Ascendant> I do that in my essays
<XAX> AUTOCORRECT CAN GO DIE :(
<Ghosties> 04And I would play multiplayer Chrysalis but it's almost 6:30 AM here and I am tired :P
<drfsupercenter> 03http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Molotch#The_City_as_a_Growth_Machine
<drfsupercenter> 03basically this
<Ninjazz|Depressed> That's terrible and you should feel terrible.
<drfsupercenter> 03is what I gather
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Ascendant> cus' only "sh*t" is blocked
<Ascendant> not *sh*t*
<drfsupercenter> 03it would help if I actually had a copy of the book we're supposed to read
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<drfsupercenter> 03<_<
<Ascendant> hah
<Espeon> I could be an anime writer I'm rather good at putting filler in stuff
<Ascendant> ebooks
<Chrysalis> Ghosties fiar enough, you might want to get a nap if its that early
<drfsupercenter> 03meh
<junh1024-XD> warez dem ebookz
<drfsupercenter> 03go find me one then
<drfsupercenter> 03but like
<Nerom> XAX why are you using t9 on your comp?
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03People like building cities by rivers, right?
<drfsupercenter> 03because of uh
<drfsupercenter> 03why
<drfsupercenter> 03what reasons
<Ninjazz|Depressed> One more day and I can stay up that long for as much as I want.
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't think right noiw
<drfsupercenter> 03*now
<junh1024-XD> water supply
<Nerom> Or are you on a pad or something?
<XAX> Nerom: I'm on my iPod touch...
<junh1024-XD> economics -> shipping by boat
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<junh1024-XD> fishing
<Chrysalis> Phase4 googling for nodejs and looking at link 3 "Node.js is a tumor on the programming community"
<junh1024-XD> power->dams
<Flareon> feesh
<Flareon> *shot*
<Phase4> Chrysalis, that artical is actualy a joke
*Ascendant wants Star Wars: TOR
<Nerom> Figured.. I was here on my school comp all the time before
<Ghosties> 04Haha, yeah, some kind of sleep would be preferable at this point in time
*Ascendant also wants Assassin's Creed
<Ascendant> Though I can pirate that
<Ascendant> but I cbf
<junh1024-XD> farming ->irrigation
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: u talking about saints row?
<junh1024-XD> farming -> solis are fertile
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah O(K
<Ghosties> 04Mhm
<drfsupercenter> 03I can only BS stuff so far
<Phase4> Chrysalis, i'm going to be blunt and say the reason most people hate javascript is because they dont understand it, the ones who do and hate it anyway have good reasons too as well though
<drfsupercenter> 03*Fast
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Ghosties, go sleep, dude.
<Phase4> that sentence kinda derped at the end
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: tbh i think if the combined SR3 s fun with SR2's customisablility it would be awesome
<Espeon> what assassin's creed Ascendant

<Ninjazz|Depressed> TheRainbowDash: I didn't mean to... :(
<Ascendant> Ah

<Malavolent> My chat derped, why is Ninjazz Depressed?
<TheRainbowDash> Kandarihu: (It is Multi Theft Auto)

*Alicorn_Prince_Shane flaps his wing to give a breeze for Airpuff
<Ascendant> there's an extra copied part in your code

<drfsupercenter> 03far too lazy
<Ascendant> and delete everything after it
<Ascendant> it's just a copypaste error
<Ascendant> other than that it works
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Well... I can't say it feels pretty good.
<Ascendant> also it looks better in python
<drfsupercenter> 03also it's much simpler to just have one random character
<Ascendant> and it's faster too
<drfsupercenter> 03because like
<Nerom> Well I'm off now Driving lesson and all.. just need to find my pants
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah

<YamaTHou> Hey @Wrek is streaming right?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Bronystate is not an RP channel, so while there are times when playing along is acceptable, constant RP is not. There are other channels on the network dedicated to role playing, or you can make your own, just take it elsewhere.
<LordCelestia> 0,5doughnutjoe, have you been NOT listening?
<doughnutjoe> RP ey?
*PinkiePry is talking with /me. REBELLION! I will stop now. :3

<Ninjazz|Depressed> Om: Indeed! ;)

<alexxm> hey Discord hows your day been
<Giger4444> She has her ups and downs, I cant really pin her down on my favourite pony scale.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Om: Don't judge me.

<Discord> alexxm: Pretty good, got started on my fanfic for MLP and now it is time to relax
<Om> GilDash: That is how you know I have seen it.

<GilDash> Om: 007: Goldeneye.
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Depressed: What, you mean that background character that works on the farm? :D

<Giger4444> well at least during the maintenance I can study instead of hanging around here :D
<Om> Discord: I was well aware
<GilDash> WallDives: Well, it is *chat* after all. :D
<Discord> Om: Just makin sure
<GilDash> Om: Being British has nothing to do with it. :)

<alexxm> what happens when maintenace happens
<Om> GilDash: But it was the only thing I could think of :'(

<GilDash> Om: Please, you'll need more than that! :D
<WallDives> who knows. a few hours?
<alexxm> which one am i on Phase4

<Malavolent> alexxm: Pretty good, how about you?
<alexxm> good Malavolent just sent you the article
<Om> Alrighty then.
<DerpStar> I'm so nervous I'm not sure if he'll like a girl proposing to him
<DerpStar> what if he says no?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good morning everyone
<WallDives> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<GilDash> DerpStar: I've got a feeling he won't mind. :)
<WallDives> DerpStar: considering all you two have been through?
<DerpStar> I guess so WallDives
<Malavolent> alexxm: For over $9000, heh. Couldn't resist.
<alexxm> yeah that happened Malavolent
<cachi01> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Malavolent> alexxm: Yep, I know. Anyway, it's pretty well written.
<alexxm> hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT hows your day been
<DerpStar> I just hope he doesn't have another girl in mind
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> alexxm just woke up so good, and yours ?
<GilDash> DerpStar: Is he seeing anyone else now?
<DerpStar> I dunno he's very attractive
<Om> Time are changing, I'm glad to see a female wanting to propose to a guy.
<alexxm> good TheGreatAndPowerfulT do you want to see the first draft of a brony article i'm working on
<WallDives> true story, Om.
<DerpStar> He has been Derping a lot around me
<Wrek> 05back from an awsome dinner
<DerpStar> WB Wrek
<GilDash> DerpStar: Maybe he's hiding something?
<GilDash> DerpStar: Maybe you just make him nervous. That might be a good thing. ;)
<DerpStar> Oh God I hope not
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> alexxm sure
<DerpStar> He's never been nervous maybe he's planing something >_>
<WallDives> DerpStar: maybe. or you could be paranoid.
<Om> If it were me I would be blunt. But I know some people are far more refined than I
<GilDash> Om: Yes, quite. You haven't got the best sense in all this. :D
<alexxm> has the chat derped
<WallDives> alexxm: no.
<Om> Moral of my story, if I say something. It is probably not the best thing to do.
<alexxm> thanks WallDives
*Gunthler eats the rest of Wrek's left overs
<crazypony> alexxm: i think so
<DerpStar> Hun I'm a woman we're all paranoid when we don't know what the man we love is doing, especially if he doesn't know I love him...
<GilDash> DerpStar: Have you actually asked him out?
<Om> Heh, hun
<DerpStar> We've been kinda hanging out together for the better part of a decade
<alexxm> just ask him DerpStar
<GilDash> DerpStar: Yes, but are you two "involved".
<WallDives> DerpStar: just take your shot. seriously.
<DerpStar> Not really but he's the only man I've felt comfortable with
<DerpStar> I'm not making my case very well...
<GilDash> DerpStar: It might be just a tiney-winey bit of a leap to propose to him if he's not aware then. :S
<Om> No, I don't think this sound like a Leap then Look thing. It might be a good idea to get involved with him, as GilDash put it, first.
<Cobellanez> If your not together, that would be the first step
<GilDash> DerpStar: Otherwise you might end up pushing him away if he's not ready. :(

<GilDash> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Thanks for the info anyway. :)

<cachi01> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: thx for the info i also live in mexico
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> GilDash so yeah if you live over seas is better if you order more than one tshirt, just to make the shipping cost worth it
<GilDash> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: As long as they don't charge per item. Otherwise, yeah, I plan on getting a minimum of a half dozen. :D

<GilDash> Ninjazz|Depressed: There's nothing to feel *worse* about. Just know that there's something you can do about it. :)
<Om> GilDash: That is just unfair
<GilDash> Om: You'll learn your lesson one day. :D
<WallDives> Om, how does it feel to be chased through the ends of the IRC earth?
<GilDash> WallDives: I dunno, but it's a pleasure chasing. :D
<Om> WallDives: Once they invent a word that describes it, i'll let you know.
<Ninjazz|Depressed> He likes it somewhere deep deep deep down. He can't just keep this up without having SOME sort of motivation.
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Depressed: Who? Om or me? :D
<Ninjazz|Depressed> Om.
<EccoCode> I don't see anything about subspaces in my book unfortanetly, but I'll still try and see what I can do about the problem.

<Lil_B> Invi techniclly 9 or 10 weeks, but the very first time i was on this site was during an apisode and everything crashed, and the next time i tried was 2 or 3 weeks later
<Wrek> 05gold certainly is a good contrast
<therainbowdashy> is this video still going on because last noight i saw the same thing O_O
<Om> Gold looks good for certain
<Wrek> 05^ sure*
<Om> Aye
<GilDash> Om: Orange, apparently.
<Lil_B> wrek both would look goodd
<Om> GilDash: So gold would be best metal then.
<cachi01> gold is worst resource in minecraft
<Invi> no
<alexxm> hey therainbowdashy hows your day been
<Om> Or copper maybe. But that isn't much a jewlery component
<Lil_B> but i think Gold is the better choice to give the picture a higher variety of colours
<GilDash> Om: Technically copper or someting similar...
<valoreins|Drawing> *puts on hipster glasses* gold is overrated, i use copper as my accessories
<therainbowdashy> alexxm good yours
<GilDash> Om: Maybe polished bronze?
<Om> GilDash: Bronze might work

<GilDash> Wrek: I'm just going for the closest metal to the "technical" complimentary colour of purple, orange.
<therainbowdashy_2> hi

<alexxm> yeah cachi01 college acyully
*drfsupercenter sighs
<Wrek> 05success
<alexxm> college actully cachi01
<Wrek> 05now to do... the... ugh tail...
*Tarku hugs everypony :3
*Wrek tableflips)
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek... NOT THE TAIL!
<Radu> It's difficult, best of luck
<Invi> moin Tarku
<EccoCode> To me it seems for the second problem, the justification portion is proving each of the 10 vector spaces axioms holds true (though since it says "together with standard matrix addition and scalar multiplication", it seems like 6/10 are already justified to me). Though I don't know about defining a subset..
*valoreins|Drawing just realized that rarity doesn't have tail
*alexxm hey Tarku hows your day been
<PinkiePry> Now everypony talks?
<GilDash> Back from tea. :)
<Gunthler> yay GilDash
<WallDives> yay.
<Wrek> 05no not difficult
<Wrek> 05tiem consuming
<Gunthler> GilDash :3
<GilDash> Aww, I have fans. :)
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek fliped the table. Now we must do the same. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)
<Gunthler> GilDash: PM :D
<GilDash> I could do with a fan right now, it's sodding boiling. :D
<Invi> you came bach from tea GilDash? is tea a place?
<PinkiePry> So gildash with all your fans you must be... COOL! Badum cha! Bad puns ftw :D
<GilDash> Invi: Tea is a time for food. :)
<cachi01> i accidentaly closed the browser
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Rarity's hair is a pain to make
<valoreins|Drawing> which one is harder to draw, rarity or princess celestia's tail?
<Invi> GilDash oh ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4jgyp8EIu1ru5991o2_500.gif
<CrimsonPhoenix> TIME FOR TICKLES
<Shizuka> 13celestia is similar to rainbow dash, just stripes of color
<WallDives> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, NO.
<PinkiePry> D:
<Shizuka> 13rarity is a gradient
<GilDash> Invi: I don't know what the equivalent is elsewhere. :D
<Gunthler> thats creepy as hell CrimsonPhoenix
<crazypony> scary discord!
<TheRandomkid321> Outside its 19 degrees celcius ad raining.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Discordelyconduct always gets me laugh
<Invi> GilDash i know it as Mahlzeit ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> each of his post
<drfsupercenter> 03where'd you get 6/10 from?
<GilDash> Invi: That isn't really what I meant. :D
<TheRandomkid321> Well iam go to bed bye
<Invi> ^^
<Wrek> 05raritys mane uses a gradient and curls. nuff said
<alexxm> hey CrimsonPhoenix hows your day been
<Invi> GilDash then explain it to mee ^^
<Manearion> OI!
<CrimsonPhoenix> meh tiresome
<Glacymr> yay
<cachi01> anypony here wants polybius?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I had a bad sleep to begin with...
<valoreins|Drawing> so, yup, rarity's tail is more time consuming
<GilDash> Invi: No, I just wanted to know what the equivalent was in America. I made an assumption. :D
<EccoCode> From the link I posted earlier, "Many of the axioms (c, d, g, h, i, and j) deal with how addition and scalar multiplication work, but W is inheriting the definition of addition and scalar multiplication from V. Therefore, since elements of W are also elements of V the six axioms listed above are guaranteed to be valid on W."
<Invi> GilDash oh xD
<pony_5380> can i post a video here? theres this guy on youtube that makes cool vids but hes not getting the attention he deserves and that makes me sad
<alexxm> not when theres a stream pony_5380
<PinkiePry> pony_5380: It's you isn't it?
<cachi01> pony_5380: nope just post the name of the vid and the user
<Wrek> 05Manearion<3
<GilDash> PinkiePry: You beat me. :D
<EccoCode> At least to me that sentence seemed similar with some parts of your second question
<PinkiePry> :D
<pony_5380> hmmm
<EccoCode> (with this sentence too) Now, technically if we wanted to show that a subset W of a vector space V was a subspace wed need to show that all 10 of the axioms from the definition of a vector space are valid, however, in reality that doesnt need to be done.
<WallDives> ...
<Ray||Studying> 02Someone good at Physics here?
<PinkiePry> We hasing a good time. :3
<cachi01> lol
<pony_5380> http://www.youtube.com/theshhas thats his channel i think
<GilDash> Ah! So she *is* leaning on something now. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't even know what an axiom is i)_O
<drfsupercenter> 03*o_O
<WallDives> dem rules...
<PinkiePry> Ya it's so you pony_5380.
<EccoCode> I think axioms in this case means rules.
<pony_5380> nooo

<EccoCode> Sorry, ^^;;, I can be bad at trying to explain things sometimes (and I don't fully understand this myself, so I am guessing of what might be helpful in trying to answer your problems.) maybe the blue text box here will help: http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/LinAlg/VectorSpaces.aspx#VS_VS_Defn1

<Malavolent> Gunthler: It's quite a long way to US from here. It would probably disintegrate till it would reach to you.
<Lil_B> also, normaly fried in a pan, but some cheap restaurants use deep fryers, because it's quicker, but it doesn't taste as good and the Breadcrump Chrust will come off to easily

<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Wow, this sounds amazing.
<Malavolent> Lil_B: There is a German dubbing? Can you send me a example? I've seen on television that there will be Czech dubbing too, on the 1st July I think.
<alexxm> scottish heavy metal pirates TheRainbowDash
<Lil_B> Malavolent ok
<flutter_shy> my little brony
<Malavolent> Lil_B: I hope they won't screw it, we have both great and lousy dubbings.
*CCCP nuzzles TheRainbowDash
<Jim> Heavy metal pirates, I approve
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: *nuzzles you back*
*flutter_spin cries
<alexxm> you want the link Jim
<flutter_spin> Violin always gets me
<Malavolent> http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf
<Jim> Saw it, alexxm
<Malavolent> Link related.
<alexxm> whats wrong flutter_spin
<flutter_spin> I have a heart for the classics. Violin or a waltz
*Michael hugs flutter_spin
<flutter_spin> There is a reason I named my OC Moonlight Sonata :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337886078271.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm Fluttershy in this
<TheRainbowDash> flutter_spin: Oh, you...absolutely amazing.:D
<cachi01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8HAbxmQ0g&feature=g-all-lik
<Lil_B> Malavolent the biggest problem i have with the german dubbing is that they don't have some more coordination. It feels like they are giving the voice actors just the text to read and thats it :/ it even is a decent Translation with some minor errors here and there
<MahBoi777> hello everyone
<flutter_shy> lol ,limeware
<Jim> Hai MahBoi777
<FillyFlam> Hiya MahBoi777

<alexxm> if there were male versions of the characters on the show who do you think would voice them
<Lil_B> Malavolent they even went so far that they dubbed the backgroundchor in the songs like "At the Gala" and such (although The Intro and "Winter Wrap up" do sound really bad)
<Gunthler> MahBoi777: Ponies! :D
<MahBoi777> hey Jim, FillyFlam, Michael, CCCP, WallDives, cachi01, and Gunthler! lol
<cachi01> THIS IS JUST A TRIBUTE U GOTTA BELIEVE ME AND I WISH U WERE THERE
<GilDash> MahBoi777: Holla! :)
<alexxm> what about me MahBoi777
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Not enough emotions in their speeches?
<MahBoi777> hey alexxm, I'm doing GREAT, goin to see The Avengers in a few hours
<Michael> MahBoi777: great movie
<alexxm> hope you enjoy it MahBoi777
<flutter_spin> I actually have the dream to meet a girl and dance with her inside a ballroom to a waltz
<RaveBrony> Why am i always pulled away from my comp once i enter the chat!?!? :[ Ahh!! What have i missed in the past few minutes? :D
<cachi01> MahBoi777: remember its a marvel movie so dont i repeat DO NOT leave before the credits end!
<MahBoi777> alexxm: thanks, how are you?
<RaveBrony> Oh, hey MahBoi777! :o

<flutter_spin> Yeah, don't miss BOTH TWO secret endings
<MahBoi777> hey RaveBrony!:D
<Wrek> 05press play dimwits
<alexxm> good MahBoi777
<WallDives> but only Wesker and Zero matter in marvel...
<Lil_B> Malavolent actually they have, but things like raising the voice, lowering the voice, screaming, things like that are there, they just sometimes don't sound right
<RaveBrony> FillyFlam: Nooo D:
<MahBoi777> hello GilDash!
<WallDives> wait,you mean the movies, nvm.
<RaveBrony> alexxm: Ah, i see, lol
<flutter_shy> http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf
<alexxm> if there were male versions of the characters on the show who do you think would voice them
<Wrek> 05alexxm
<RaveBrony> Oh, ty Wrek :D
<RaveBrony> Wait....
<Wrek> 05wait what?
<alexxm> Wrek i've only got the buffering circle
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<FillyFlam> ...My wits are still dim.
<flutter_spin> still no vid
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Oh, I see. I'm looking at the first episode in German dub and it sounds pretty good!
<MahBoi777> cachi01: I'll remember that lol
<cachi01> lol
<Wrek> 05well thank you for actually saying it then. i mean without you tellign me i would never have realized. thank you so much
<flutter_spin> can't tell if sarcasm
<RaveBrony> ^
<Lil_B> Malavolent also, the voices of rainbowdash and Fluttershy don't really fit (althugh RD got one of germanys best voice actors and Fluttershys voice is so god damn hard to really sound so hushed
