<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Bronysith i just trolled with the How I Met Your Mother joke, but i really wa- wait if it ends here i will still be curius how i started the techinically things.
<FairsHuff|Busy> 555 episodes of One Piece. Why is it so awesome? 12 years that anime has been running.
<alexxm> where is this song from
<Vordox> No, not FF
<Bronysith> FairsHuff|Busy: it is good
<Bronysith> FairsHuff|Busy: but it is so fucking long
<Bronysith> LILO AND STICH?!
<Vordox> FairsHuff|Busy: Man, those tankeboun of 32. A manga going on for over 25 years, why is it so awesome.
<FlareChaser> Great music mate, but I gotta go, cya.
<FairsHuff|Busy> Bronysith Doesn't matter. I've watched it 3 times already
<CCCP> .... this is all irrelivant!!! theres noooo Desu!! ;_;
<alexxm> bye FlareChaser
<Vordox> FairsHuff|Busy: Go read Berzerk
<CCCP> bye flar- DESU!!! :[
<Meanwhile> This is wonderful.
<VioletVanilla> 06He needs a little time ponies, I will play some musik for you in the meantime (:
<Vordox> LAWL prince-dari XD
<FairsHuff|Busy> Vordox Watched the anime. Too disturbing. It has rape in it.
<Vordox> VioletVanilla: Are you playingthe piano!?
<Bronysith> Phase4: /)
*VioletVanilla giggles
<CCCP> prince-dari: so true - desu
<Vordox> FairsHuff|Busy: Nono, the MANGA; not the anime. ._. the anime is meh
<Meanwhile> dari: that's surprisingly accurate.
<VioletVanilla> 06I would like to learn this song. .
<prince-dari> I know...
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, (\ suprise brohoof
<VioletVanilla> 06how could I type while playing though? c;
*Phase4 00,02hugs VioletVanilla
<Vordox> VioletVanilla: ....Derp
<Bronysith> Phase4: almost as good as the other surprise stuff. lolo
<Ponies47> I'm still here. I'm just doing other stuff
<kirzstryfe> 8,6you could type while playing because Vi is OP
*Vordox goes do a speed drawing of Phase and Vivi sitting in a tree
<Vordox> While Shizuka is furiously trying to climb it.
<Bronysith> VioletVanilla: 4th wall breaking
<Saturn> 08,01VioletVanilla: use your nose
<Phase4> 00,02lol Vordox
<Bronysith> Saturn: or feet
<FairysHuff> Think I will go back and watch the Battle of CP9 story arc. That was probably the best one.
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Vordox> FairysHuff: You missed out...
<Vordox> FairysHuff: Go watch movie 10
<Vordox> Or the one with the Green plant eating humans :P
<Saturn> 08,01i've been having an interesting discussion about the sensitivity of unicorn horns
<FairysHuff> Vordox Why?
<Saturn> 08,01and pegasus wings
<Vordox> FairysHuff: Recommend them
<Saturn> 08,01i think the pegasus wings are the most interesting
<Vordox> The Green plant one is AMAZINGLY grimdark for One Piece
<Saturn> 08,01it's often said in fanfictions that they're more sensitive, but i'd disagree
<Vordox> Saturn: Why not both? :P
<Saturn> 08,01i'd think that feathered skin would be diferently sensitive
<alexxm> i have no idea whats going on
<FairysHuff> Vordox I tend to not watch the movies as they aren't all that good. But I shall give it a go I suppse
<Saturn> 08,01just as hairy skin is diferently sensitive to non hair skin
<Vordox> Saturn: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/ab072716c0f77fe86079184ab96e8a96/133828%20-%20artist%3Ajohn_joseco%20ask_molestia%20ask_princess_molestia%20celestia%20luna%20Molestia%20wingboner.png
<Kandarihu> Green Plant, you mean movie 6?
<Vordox> Need I say more Saturn? XD
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-discords-chaotic-work-force.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01because feathers are more rigid than hair, moving them would feel diferent, as feeling is derived from nerve endings on the skin
<Saturn> 08,01as far as i'm aware, feathers contain no nerve endings
*Nittany_Discord 11,01glomps kirzstryfe
<Vordox> FairysHuff: Trust me...Let me get the names
*Invi smooths to the jazz
<Saturn> 08,01which would mean that, if anything, the control surfaces of wings would be *less* sensitive
<Saturn> 08,01as they'd be mostly feathers
<FairysHuff> Vordox No need. The chat moves too fast I'd miss them ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: this had better be clean
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wings are fun.
<Vordox> Saturn: Clean enough
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: shorten the links; i can't get to it
<Saturn> 08,01*link

<Saturn> 08,01also, unicorn horns: the way i see it, they're just magically conductive bones
<alexxm> what was it Narolas
<Vordox> FairysHuff: And Strong World
<Saturn> 08,01linked to the brain, yes, but albeit without nerve endings
<alexxm> FairysHuff i'm from the UK
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: i'm from the UK, but you probably already knew that

<Narolas> Have you guys seen the gyspy jazz cover of gypsy bard on EQD and youtube, i made a comment on there, i said it wasn' really good (not in a mean way) and the beat wasn't right ... but people didn't like the comment when i was just trying to help :(
<Ryunosuke> *Magic and magical abilities

<FairysHuff> You know whats annoying. Feeling tired and droopy but knowing if you go to bed to sleep you'll just toss and turn all night and wake up angry >_< GRRRR

<kirzstryfe> 8,6seriously now, can't you all find something to entertain yourselves that doesn't involve constantly linking videos?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a semi-professional classical singer
<Vordox> Saturn: Heh, who knows. :P
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: But...this is the internet
<CCCCCCCP> http://derpy.me/qwY7c
<Reikim> Hrm
<Meanwhile> Oh to play a game of LoL or not to play a game of LoL, that is the question.
<Bronysith> hi Reikim
<TheNebulaBrony> listen to my discord song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0lXZGeIk_4&feature=plcp
<CrazyHippie1234> hi everypony

<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: how about linking images?
<Cypresswolf> Unnr: :) Not to make you feel taller - but my family is known to be short - I'm taller than the average family member - I have a few who are 4' 10" :)
<CCCCCCCP> hi CrazyHippie1234!!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D HOW ARE YOU? :D
<Saturn> 08,01i hate being in the countryside
<Vordox> Let's do a 5v5 Brony Only LoL game with the Mid Lane map!
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Depends. Are you willing to sink a total of over 45 minutes on a random game where you could potentially get teamed with a bunch of amateur brazilians with no respect for anyone else?
<Spectrum_Rush> kirzstryfe: I could initiate Wet Mane Hour if ya like
<CrazyHippie1234> good
<Saturn> 08,01but one more year, then i can move back to the city
<Saturn> 08,01with a nice, shiny degree to my name

<Saturn> 08,01and start my PhD
<Vordox> Saturn: PhD of Broniness?

<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh don't worr. :D

<Meanwhile> Vordox: UK, EU West.
<Reikim> Sounds like a villain from a bad 60s comic.
<Unnr> Dr. Saturn sounds like the name of an evil villian
<Vordox> Hmmm...
<CrazyHippie> IM SOOOO bored
<Vordox> You know what we can do...?
<Saturn> 08,01my god, yes
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a supervillain
<kirzstryfe> 8,6TheNebulaBrony, now I know you didn't just join this chat to advertise yourself...
<CrazyHippie> ahaha
<Unnr> Before I kill you, mr bond. I WON¨T TELL YOU ANYTHING, DR SATURN!
<Meanwhile> Ofc he did.
<Vordox> How about all join the EU west with Level 1 and do AR Mid 5v5 Custom map? ;)
<Saturn> 08,01but i'm the worst supervillain
<Saturn> 08,01because i'm actually really nice
<TheNebulaBrony> maybe ;)
<Cypresswolf> Makes me feel a bit heroic - Grandma: Can you get that pan off the fridge for me? Me: Of Course I Can! *reaches* Here you go, Citizen! :)
<Reikim> Vordox: I know that's LoL speak, but I'm having trouble deciphering it.
<RAWRity> so now Saturn is Dr. Horrible?
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: You know...it's not a bad song
<Vordox> It's very Jammy and...Sassy?

<CCCCCCCP> It is
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: You should ban him Kirz
<CCCCCCCP> :P
<RAWRity> So, after absorbing through osmosis the whole "Walking Dead" marathon today, I have come to the conclusion that these characters are some of the dumbest fuckers ever shoved into a zombie apocalypse.
<Kandarihu> Well, we don't have a stream up. So is it even against the rules?
<Reikim2> Now that was an awkward DC. Did anything happen while I was gone?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i has no idea what to do now ... http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/190/b/2/queen_chrysalis__by_ponycharacter-d56mt9i.png
<otakon> CCCCCCCP: they gonna ban ya.
<CCCCCCCP> me:o
<CCCCCCCP> :(
<Vordox> You need a valid reason why he should be banned?
<Yahooz> eyo WallDives you there?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I try not to actually ban people without good cause
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: Check the tags on his song
<WallDives> Yahooz, eeyup.

<Yahooz> orly now?
<Vordox> But then agian kirzstryfe ...It's not a bad song, for a first time.
<Vordox> But false advertising tags
<Sallymeow1> I havent been talking much guys
<Yahooz> bai TheNebulaBrony
<WallDives> Yahooz, POCKET RALF.
<Vordox> Ergh, I'm 50% /50%
<RAWRity> FairysHuff: it's not like simple mistakes. These people attempt to CARRY A BABY TO TERM in the middle of a god damn zombie apocalypse.
<Yahooz> see you never
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> TheNebulaBrony See ya
<Sallymeow1> sorry bout that
<RAWRity> that is a TERRIBLE idea.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh kirz is fast
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dammit kirzstryfe
<otakon> OH goddammit
<Reikim> RAWRity: Commonly this is known as the "idiot plot". The entire plot revolves around the cast being singlemindedly retarded.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Gotta give him the repeal e-mail.
<otakon> did you kick him or just ban him?
<Yahooz> WallDives: holy crap these grand finals are hype
<otakon> YOU BANNED HIM?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ban.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6not with that one
<Vordox> Damnit Nebula... You're on a fine edge but he actually made some minor effort in this song... ._.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He's banned.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> just got Red Dead Redemption a couple days ago and it is awesome /)^3^(\
<Yahooz> otakon: yuhuh
<otakon> oh goddammit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'm keeping him banned.
<Sallymeow1> not like you care though
<PonyNegZero> Oh, TF2 clan match - see ya
<Vordox> Fine kirzstryfe give him a chance then. >.>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I doubt he'll learn.
<RAWRity> Reikim: first, I know TV Tropes, don't quote them at me. 2nd, it's more that these people refuse to accept the fact that they cannt have some magical happy ending without some blood loss.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: so, he's done this before?
<FairysHuff> RAWRity hehe ^_^ What do you expect? It's TV, tv people are stupid. Just like screaming women running in horror films.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> on the other hand that song wasen't that bad
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I'll log it Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.
<Reikim> You know, the sad part is, it wasn't even a bad song. In fact it was kind of good.
<otakon> Reikim: I'm listening to it now
<RAWRity> FairysHuff: because it's incredibly easy to make characters who aren't stupid. That's why I expect it of writers.
<Vordox> Wait, you gave him the ban anyway, mods?
<otakon> it's not bad at all
<otakon> Vordox: they did
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: He came in, advertised, then PM advertised me. Got kicked. Advertised some more.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Ah... crap.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: did anyone explain or just automatic kick?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd say that he's here just to advertise and do nothing else.
<Vordox> Damnit, I liked his simple style. ._.
<CCCP> okay bye everypony!!!
<Reikim> RAWRity: Yes, I know you know which is why I use it for witty effect because I know that you will get it. On another note, it's entirely possible that the show could be construed as a metaphor for society.
<otakon> bye CCCP take care
<FairysHuff> RAWRity I want a games publisher that won't water down their games to reach "A wider audience" but we caqn't get everything we want ^_^
<CCCP> otakon: :D
<Vordox> I'll PM him and ask him what he'll do with Bronystate, I feel that he's just trying. ><
<Bronysith> I FUCKING KNEW IT http://derpy.me/BRnwS
<SuperBrony64|BUSY> 11,02otakon: We know what we're doing, what he did was against our rules and we dealt with it appropriately.
<Bronysith> oh hi SuperBrony64|BUSY
<otakon> fine
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzKOPYO_Kt0 <-- We should totally watch this series.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> right on SB64! /)
<Vordox> SuperBrony64|BUSY: What if he sends a formal apology then?
<RAWRity> FairysHuff: but again, we can have that, because it's entirely within our power to have it. Thus, people who are not able to achieve this are considered failures.
<Vordox> Are you, Bronystate, mind giving him a chance to become a part here, if he does apologize or show some guilt?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soooo mechas ?
<SuperBrony64|BUSY> 11,02Vordox: He'll be reviewed and decided whether to lift his ban.
<RedPegasus|Soviet> What'd I miss?
<prince-dari> 5,14New BS Post
<prince-dari> 14,5New BS Post
<Reikim> RAWRity: TV reflects culture. Our culture can't accept that we can't have a magical happy ending without sacrifices.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If he wanted to advertise with us properly, he would have e-mailed us or PMed us asking for permission.
<prince-dari> 14,15New BS Post
<FairysHuff> Who was banned and why?
<prince-dari> 15,14New BS Post
<Reikim> RAWRity: Perhaps it's allegorical.
<Vordox> Got it. I feel that this guy might go somewhere, and hey, any music talent that knows how to link notes together in a better way is a waste to lose.
<otakon> unless you know he just rushed in like MOST people do
<Sallymeow1> Ill come back later
<otakon> and didn't read the rules like MOST people do
<otakon> also, NO STREAM

<RedPegasus|Soviet> Who has been banned?

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so he'll be judged like the Kryptonion criminals from Superman 2 and if found guilty, drift though space in a sheet of glass? lol
<RAWRity> Reikim: no, it's mostly that these characters are poorly written.
<otakon> RedPegasus|Soviet: TheNebulaPony
<kirzstryfe> 8,6if he can find the email address to make an appeal on his own, formulates a coherent and sincere appeal, and doesn't attempt to ban evade before a decision is made, then he may be able to return
<RedPegasus|Soviet> What'd he do?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Exactly.
<prince-dari> 1,5New BS Post
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And he linked his work more than once.
<otakon> RedPegasus|Soviet: advertised his YT channel during no stream.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And forcefully linked it.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6otakon, the issue is he came into the channel for the sole purpose of advertising himself

<Bronysith> RAWRity: approve
<Magic_Rhombus> well...
<otakon> nice Cadence

<SuperBrony64|BUSY> 11,02We're done discussing our process for determining who gets banned and why. If you need to know more, please feel free to review our rules on the main page.

<Reikim> otakon: No it's not and you know it.
<otakon> WEll that's what the rules say
<Randomnerd> We'll be at a convention, but it's not appropriate to ask the ladies to assist.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6there is a difference between people that have contributed to the conversation linking videos for others to see in order to expand interest in subjects, and people entering the channel for the -sole purpose- of advertising

<owlicious> Yellow on black. Also, unescape the HTML Characters!

<otakon> DON'T DO IT!
<otakon> I vote 3
<Petrified_Discord> prince-dari: Well the first two look like shit and the third one I can't even read. So...none of the above? 6_9
<Vordox> Rainbow was the best, it didn't burn your eyes. And didn't look bad for attention prince-dari
<hen3ry> my plan has a flaw
<otakon> THREE I SAY!
<Reikim> So many rainbows
<Canadian_Brony> the last one was broken

<Reikim> Rainbows that are doubled
<Petrified_Discord> Bronystate is best BS

<otakon> prince-dari: I thought you said no intergers!
*owlicious facehooves
<prince-dari> Yes...
<owlicious> pi isn't an integer
<hen3ry> pi is not an integer
<otakon> pi is NOT a whole number that is for sure
<prince-dari> It's not an integer.
<xxMoopyxx> hey some go to omegle and stream it on the air
<owlicious> it isn't even a fraction
<Reikim> Pi is an irrational number.
<Lightning-Quill> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBYGTEj7s0w evil version of party with pinkie
<Vordox> Er... Dari
<otakon> but it's not a whole number
<Vordox> You can't say PI has a number
<prince-dari> He asked me if the number I was thinking of was an integer.
<owlicious> its also a trancendental number
<Spectrum_Rush> owlicious: of course not... its a decimal :p
<prince-dari> The number I was thinking of was not an integer.
<Vordox> Pi is NOT a number, it's a THEORY of a number based on an endless decimals
<Petrified_Discord> Honey_Sprinkles: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2637/
<Vordox> It's not a FINALIZED number
<otakon> still
<prince-dari> Vordox: You mad coz you lost
<otakon> he got it
<Reikim> Vordox: Actually it's an irrational number. It's still a number.
<Vordox> No prince-dari, it's called Math :P
<prince-dari> Maths*
<otakon> hen3ry: what do you want to pick? Rainbow or Dirty Rarity?
<prince-dari> Get it right
<prince-dari> :P
<Petrified_Discord> Reikim: You better talk some sense into that number
<Vordox> :p
<Reikim> Vordox: Pi fits within the Reals, and is therefore a number.
<prince-dari> hen3ry: Choose the colour then. :P
<Vordox> FINE! Screw Common Sense and Maths...Just say Pi, or Taix2
<hen3ry> otakon: rainbow hurts my eyes, so dirty rarity it is

<Petrified_Discord> Implying that this will end :D
<otakon> Ninjazz: for prince-dari maybe from him laughing his ass off.
<Vordox> Best POny is Best Pony = Pi is Number. <--- YOU SEE THE LOGIC HERE?!?!?!?!?
<Vordox> Argh Headache...Humans...
<otakon> agreed
<Bronysith> seems legit http://derpy.me/9q3Te
<Honey_Sprinkles> Best pony is Pinkie-diepie
<Reikim> Vordox: They're both true statements, technically, so the entire statement is true.
<Lightning-Quill> What the Buck?
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: Logic merely allows one to be wrong with authority.
<Litwick> Dirty Rarity is a color now?
<prince-dari> Litwick: Yep.
<Vordox> Technically..!?
<prince-dari> 6,15This colour
<Derpy_Hooves> did someone say pi?~ https://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/1714
<Vordox> Petrified_Discord: :'( I sad for that
<Ninjazz> Yay.
<otakon> http://youtu.be/N5T-i2Wb7Ek
<owlicious> that is a mess!
<Reikim> That's not right. That's Shizu on Grey.
<otakon> prince-dari: it works man
<Reikim> Oh wait that's just my eyes going, sorry.
<Vordox> inb4 people go blind =P
<prince-dari> Lawl Reikim
<owlicious> damnit, now i have to pair shizu and grey.
<otakon> dammit wrong link
<prince-dari> Shizu on grey would be
<Petrified_Discord> otakon: lol
<prince-dari> 13,15This I think?
<owlicious> and i don't even know what grey looks like
<Honey_Sprinkles> Dirty rarity is a colour..Is it purple + white + mud/brown :o

<Petrified_Discord> prince-dari: EEEEEEEEEEEW
<otakon> that's that THAT bad
<Vordox> Fine, if you want Irrational in this world, Nittany_Discord DO STUFF!
<Saturn> 08,01tau is best number
<otakon> Bronysith: NO SPOILERS!
<Reikim> Oh look, it's Shizu x Saxy colours.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wut?
<Vordox> Not Chaos, but Irrational stuff!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just got back from the bathroom.
<Petrified_Discord> Bronysith: XD
<otakon> Bronysith: now GET IN MY VAN!
<hen3ry> dat leak
<Vordox> Saturn: Is Pi really a number, Saturn ?
<Bronysith> otakon: already did
<owlicious> yes
<hen3ry> free candy too I bet
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: now theres a ship and a half
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: it is
<Bronysith> otakon: still dont regret it
<Vordox> Saturn: Since it's number cannot be finalized, it should not count as a number, right?
<otakon> Bronysith: He pays the bills, but does not mean I'm not person!
<Spectrum_Rush> speaking of ships
<Saturn> 08,01but tau is better
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: PI IS A NUMBER :|
<otakon> Oh Goddammit that's it
<owlicious> that's like saying sqrt(2) isn't a number
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: its called an irrational number
<otakon> I'm buying the LIVE version of Resident Evil 4
<hen3ry> sqrt(2) was my first guess.
<Spectrum_Rush> Scootaluna is best ship... name
<owlicious> you can get the nth digit with enough computing power
<otakon> I need it in HD
<otakon> I NEED IT GODDAMMIT!
*Bronysith slaps otakon
<otakon> Bronysith: but it's SO GOOD!
<Bronysith> otakon: GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm thinking of number between 1 and toilet.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: plunger
<owlicious> number 2
<Lightning-Quill> 2
<Vordox> Is it the Toilet seat?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: is it pinkie pie?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Correct otakon!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<otakon> I KNEW IT!
<hen3ry> 0.9999... (repeating infinitely) is exactly equal to 1.0. You can't explain that.
*Petrified_Discord pushes Bronysith out of the way and slaps otakon with something larger
<Lightning-Quill> Nasty
<Vordox> HOW DO YOU
<Vordox> WHAT
<owlicious> let a = 0.99999....
<Vordox> ARGGH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01hen3ry: I can.
<Derpy_Hooves> GENTLEPONIES
<owlicious> 10a - a = 9
<owlicious> a = 1
<Saturn> 08,01hen3ry: eeyup
<Reikim> hen3ry: No it's not. It's infinitely close to 1, but not quite there.
<Derpy_Hooves> and FRIENDS
<Vordox> It's like saying "This is an answer CAUSE IT IS AN ANSWER"...
<owlicious> it is there
<hen3ry> Reikim: no, it is exact.
<Vordox> While NOT being a correct one
<Lightning-Quill> Almost done downloading MLP in 1080p season 1
<Honey_Sprinkles> How equestria was made. Friendship.
<owlicious> if it wasn't there would be a number between 0.99999... and 1
<Bronysith> PINKIE I AM BEGGIN YOU TO PLEASE DO THIS http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-hi-whatcha-watchin.gif
<hen3ry> one of the first weird things in math people actively rebel at, but it is verifiably true
<Petrified_Discord> Fuck yeah, friendship!
<Derpy_Hooves> feast your eyes...on THIS: http://derpy.me/nmq0j
<Vordox> RIGHT I'll break it down to...Elementary Math School
<Reikim> Oh great a math debate
<Vordox> IF we speak of terms for irrational numbers
<Petrified_Discord> Derpy_Hooves: MY EYES! *is burned to ashes*
<otakon> http://youtu.be/xr6L7-yVp0s I found the right link!
<owlicious> i'm great at math debating!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,0110*0.999 - 0.999 = 99.999.. - 0.9999... = 99 =/= 1.
<Vordox> RIGHT then, is Saturn's Pi the SAME as Otakon's Pi?
<owlicious> Nittany_Discord: i already said that
<Vordox> Ow my eyes.
<SlurryMoon> 3PINK
<Saturn> 08,01my pi is 3.14159265354...
<prince-dari> The number of troll arguments me and my friend have had with the whole of our maths class and teacher over 0.999...=1
<otakon> prince-dari: the text looks too thick
<Vordox> AND otakon What's your Pi?
<Bronysith> prince-dari: this is false http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-cadence-cant-share-the-spotlight.png
<Reikim> Dirty Rarity has spoken.
<Petrified_Discord> prince-dari: The only difficulty with that color is that it's hard to see the links, but that's okay I guess :$
<otakon> Vordox: chocolate creme
<owlicious> ESCAPE IT YOU FOAL
<Vordox> SEE
<owlicious> *UNESCAPE
<prince-dari> 0.999...^infinity tends to 0
<hen3ry> My pi is the ratio of the length of a circle's radius to its diameter in euclidian space. It's exact.
<prince-dari> 1^infinity = 1
<Prick> ahah! http://i45.tinypic.com/5wz72a.jpg what do ya think of the lovable Prick :D
<prince-dari> Therefore not equal.
<Vordox> ....
<prince-dari> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But there are a bunch of proofs for 0.9999 = 1.
<Cypresswolf> My pi is exactly 3!
<Vordox> ALL THIS MATH IS HURTING my braaaain
<Cypresswolf> slices
<Vordox> And people's way of showing it. ><
<Litwick> I SWEAR TO GOD IF SOMEONE SPOILS ANYTHING FROM KORRA, ILL MURDER THEM.
<Petrified_Discord> But infinity is not a number, but a mathematical concept. Don't worry about it Vordox :)

<Vordox> Petrified_Discord: It's all theories though!
<Litwick> Eveyrone on tumblr already spoiled who Amon was.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A good one is using a geometric series.
<Litwick> And now Im mad.
<Vordox> How can a fact by a theory when it's based on several perspectives to understand the world, IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhh i need to find something to do ...
<CriticKitten> Because "theory" doesn't mean what you think it means.
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: No it's not. All math aside from postulates is based on proofs. There are proofs for 1+1=2 and even 1=1, and they are really old and really long. Read them if you get a chance :)
<Petrified_Discord> *are
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: 1+1 = 11, 1+1 = 2, 1+1 = B, 1+1 = 10, 1+1 = Eyes

<hen3ry> I really stirred up the hornet's nest this time. Yay. </Fluttershy>
<CrimsonPhoenix> You get an F for Fantastic

<Meanwhile> Why must you start zombie while I am trying to photoshop?
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: The roof the roof the roof is on fire
<Saturn> 08,01BUCK's not been yet
<owlicious> oops
<hen3ry> We only have official ponies for two days of the week, this is unacceptable.
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: WE DON'T NEED NO WATER LET THE MOTHERFUCKER BURN
<owlicious> well, you'll think of something, right
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi guys
<Meanwhile> Eeeeeeh. Break.
<Spectrum_Rush> speaking of bronycon http://derpiboo.ru/35306
<Vordox> Still, Saturn I'm so getting angry at how math is handled when it becomes so convulated that it changes the very course of common thinking with it's way of how it can be communicated to various degress based on theories that cannot be proven due to it being abstract to begin with.
<Saturn> 08,01BUCK: Our venue is 20% less flamable than other conventions
<Lightning-Quill> WE don't have any fire let the bucker be refreshed :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: I might put that to the test.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is a complete store
<Petrified_Discord> Spectrum_Rush: http://derpy.me/UZFEP
<killerpony7733> prince-dari: Woah *mind blown*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and then everyone launched left4dead
<Spectrum_Rush> Petrified_Discord: i've got a different one :p http://derpiboo.ru/30847
<Lightning-Quill> hungry....food time!!
<CriticKitten> Theory does not mean unproven in that context. A vast majority of scientific understanding is based on theories. This isn't fricking School House Rock, where a theory sits on the steps in front of the White House and sings about how he becomes a law. Theories do not work that way. ._.
<Petrified_Discord> Spectrum_Rush: It's okay. Mare Do Well and Spiderman saved us all!
<CriticKitten> You're confusing the standard English meaning of "theory" with the scientific meaning.
<Vordox> Then why does everyone say that Theories creates facts when proven to be?
<Reikim> Except those of us that don't have it.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6because I need a break from stuff, and shooting zombies helps
<CriticKitten> "Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge. This is significantly different from the word "theory" in common usage, which implies that something is unproven or speculative."
<kirzstryfe> 8,6and a campaign relieves a lot more stress than a vs
<Reikim> Amen.
<Spectrum_Rush> Petrified_Discord: spidaman to save the day http://derpiboo.ru/28431
<hen3ry> I have a theory, they might be bunnies....
<owlicious> hen3ry: hypothesis
<Vordox> That's...weird..
<owlicious> you need supporting evidence and predictions for theory
<Lightning-Quill> I'll be back when I have eaten and when the chat moves over to a different subject
<Vordox> How comes Scientific Theories outvalue Religious theories then...?
<Vordox> Shrug ANYWAY
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: You might be thinking of postulates. Postulates are things that we believe to be true but cannot actually prove to be true.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat are you guys talking about?
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: scientific theories get validated by evidence and peer reviewed
<Petrified_Discord> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Math
<Litwick> God dammit im bored.
<Vordox> I'll just say this, our very foundation of standing can be flipped within one single find of evidence that our understand of how the universe work. How can it be rigourus then?
<Saturn> 08,01ones that are provably wrogn are jun.ked
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<Vordox> It's more like "This is what we believe, therefor it is" <---
<Litwick> So who wants to watch Twin Peaks with me?
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Because it's incredibly easy to change a situation with only a little more information.
<Vordox> True CriticKitten
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: you contradict yourself. im not sure rigorous means what you think it means.
<owlicious> it isn't really flipped most of the time. Newtonian physics is a very good approximation of Einstein's physics.
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: No, scientific theories are based on what we observe, not what we believe.
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpiboo.ru/35836 Megasweet y u look similar to J. Joseco
<owlicious> at low velocities, anyway
<Vordox> The very base of what our understanding is, like the "ground" For what we based those theories on.
<hen3ry> these days most scientific theorys depend on whose funding the study anyway.
<Vordox> Isn't that what Rigorous means?
<hen3ry> don't take it too seriously guys
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: rigorous means thourough
<hen3ry> and... ok, I'm gonna go get some food, since my grammar is getting atrocious.
<Vordox> Oh that meaning of it.
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: Yes, science is rigorous because in order for something to be accepted as true, you must first try everything within your power to disprove it. Only when you fail can you being to prove it's truth.
<Spectrum_Rush> science is a thing were you do stuff to proof a thing...
<Vordox> ...Only when you...fail?
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: Fail to disprove it
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> Reverse science, I like that. :P
<owlicious> Spectrum_Rush: no, it's to find out how something works
<hen3ry> That's how it's supposed to work anyway.
<hen3ry> It's deduction. Let "x" be your theory. Find "not x" - if you succeed, x is false.
<Petrified_Discord> Technology (n): Anything that's really cool but you have no idea how it works and if it breaks you have to buy a new one.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: You're also confusing law with theory. Law is, most simply put, "what" is happening. A theory is the explanation behind it.
<Spectrum_Rush> owlicious: exactly to proof that a thing works because of stuff :p
<hen3ry> Law has no formal definition in science really. It's just a theory that's venerable.
<owlicious> oops, i thought you meant you had in mind what you wanted to prove ahead of time.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: That I did not know, I assume you mean things like Newton's Law etc
<hen3ry> Relativity is still called "The Theory of"
<Vordox> It happens cause it happens, why
<owlicious> Part of it was accepting when you're wrong
<CriticKitten> For example: If you throw an apple in the air, it'll eventually fall and return to Earth. That's a law. The explanation for this (gravity) is a theory.
<Petrified_Discord> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3384/
<owlicious> CriticKitten: not if you throw it hard enough
<hen3ry> orbit!
<Vordox> Actually it does owlicious, It's a logic number
<Canadian_Brony> I'm back. Did I miss anything?
<Vordox> Or rather, an equation if I recall last time I read about it.
<Vordox> Canadian_Brony: IQ Discussion over 200!!!
<Bronysith> derpy i love you... STAY OUTTA MY PC
<Spectrum_Rush> ya''ll http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aaubVlhNK4
<CriticKitten> So scientific law forms the "what" and theory is the "how".
<Vordox> That I understand.
<hen3ry> the terminology is not consistent, you just have to deal with that.
<CriticKitten> Thus, theory is not inherently unproven.
<Vordox> The "What" to the "why" to the "how" CriticKitten.
<owlicious> I thought a "scientific law" referred to something that could be described and predicted using equations.
<Canadian_Brony> Vordox I dont' even know my IQ
<Saturn> 08,01i really want to give you an in depth explanation of scientific process, vordox
<Vordox> Saturn: Maybe someday.
<Saturn> 08,01but im on my phone
<Petrified_Discord> owlicious: Usually but not necessarily
<owlicious> example?
<Vordox> I'm not native to any english language. =P Just saying
<Spectrum_Rush> brb

<Petrified_Discord> It's okay Vordox, trust us http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1743/
<Vordox> Lol Petrified_Discord
<Vordox> Still...
<panda-drawing> Saturn O_____o
<owlicious> If it involved alicorns, i will hunt you down.
<Canadian_Brony> Science?
<CriticKitten> owlicious: Laws are more restricted than theories because the related equations and such are limited to specific circumstances.
<Saturn> 08,01panda-drawing: yes?
<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: SCIENCE!
<hen3ry> A lot of times, theories/laws predict statistical rather than exact outcomes.
<panda-drawing> Saturn <3 wubs?
<Science_Brony> I AM SCIENCE!!!!1
<Vordox> I'll say this, there is a chance one day our whole understanding, a single thing, can overturn our whole universal understanding of the science we have today
<Vordox> It'll happen, no doubt.
<prince-dari> Hah
<Saturn> 08,01panda-drawing: all the wubs
<hen3ry> I can describe an equation for where an electron is, but I can't tell you where exactly it is.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RPing a planet takes a lot of thumb work.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: So?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<CriticKitten> It's happened before.
<panda-drawing> Saturn yay ^-^
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Then we have lived in a scientific lie for over several millenia.
<Unnr> o/
<CriticKitten> Welcome to reality?
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Indeed.
<Lightning-Quill> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AHHOTDzWuM did someone say wubs? :D
<hen3ry> Don't get tripped over the term "Law" vs "Theory" in science. They can be interchanged freely
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yes Vordox indeed
<CriticKitten> It's not a lie, mind.
<hen3ry> or fairly freely anyway
<Unnr> Nittany_Discord: How does it take thumb work to RP a planet?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know.
<DeadpoolDash> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/345/435/b12.gif
<CriticKitten> hen3ry: No they can't. >_>
<hen3ry> Human language is less exact than reality.
<Science_Brony> CriticKitten Reality is what has been, what will be, and what is, not our perception of the afforementioned.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> DeadpoolDash: awesome
<Petrified_Discord> Funfact: The universe is big. Really big. Really fucking big. Trying to understand everything is like trying to do something impossible. Because it is. But keep trying anyway, because you've got nothing better to do.
<hen3ry> CriticKitten: Theory of Relativity, Law of Gravity. Those two should be reversed, if Law is stronger than Theory.
<Litwick> So guys, lets talk about how fucking creepy the Ns Room theme is in Pokemon Black and White 2!
<CriticKitten> hen3ry: Theory and law in science have very defined meanings. >_>
<hen3ry> it's a language issue

<Science_Brony> Petrified_Discord I have a book called "You Are Here" which gives an in-depth explanation of our perception of the universe
<DuskStarshimmer> !seen eris
<CriticKitten> hen3ry: So no, it's just that you don't understand the term, not that the term is wrong. :P
<Vordox> And so I caused some Chaos in this room. :P
<hen3ry> pff.
<Petrified_Discord> Science_Brony, y u so science?!
<Lightning-Quill> There is a theory stating that all we learn we are relearning and that in fact we used to know it
<Saturn> 08,01ni ni sexy xx
<Honey_Sprinkles> Visiting pony blogs ^^.

<Ponies47> Saturn: You silly :P
<CriticKitten> Newton's "Laws of Gravity" are laws that remain true within the theoretical concept of "gravity".
<Science_Brony> afk
<panda-drawing> Saturn rooted?
<Science_Brony> FOR SCIENCE1!!
<Saturn> 08,01panda-drawing: of course :P
<hen3ry> and I still say, it must be bunnies.
<panda-drawing> Saturn hehe /) over clocked?
<CriticKitten> hen3ry: "Laws differ from scientific theories in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found to be false when extrapolated."

<CriticKitten> hen3ry: The misconception that Wiki (a place which is obligated to cite its sources) is less reliable than other websites (which rarely if ever cite sources for their information) is just a lie your English teacher told you to keep you from using it.

<hen3ry> I have an M.S. in Chemistry. I think I qualify as de jure.
<Litwick> Im gonig into stream deprivation. Thank god for tumblr.
<Lightning-Quill> I just like knowledge
<owlicious> i should look up de facto, actually...
<panda-drawing> Sorry im not a physisist or anything just psychologist.... so... this stuff flies over my head ^-^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Laws are stronger than theory though I question why Ohms' Law is called a law.
<hen3ry> CriticKitten: I didn't say it was less reliable than other websites in general. Just that it's not the final word or authority, given that any idiot can edit it.
<Saturn> 08,01de facto means "in practice" or "in fact"
<Vordox> Ohm's Law? Resistance Theory?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<CriticKitten> hen3ry: Yes, but it's easily reversed. >_>
<panda-drawing> De faco is french then?
<Petrified_Discord> Nittany_Discord: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJiYrRcfQo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are exceptions to Ohms law.
<owlicious> Ohm's law is an approximation at low voltages
<hen3ry> latin, panda-drawing
<Vordox> Saturn: But fact is meant to be "The real".
<Vordox> How can facts comes from Theories that cannot be disapproven?
<panda-drawing> hen3ry what i meant ^^;
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Laws are the authority within specific circumstances.
<Saturn> 08,01a law is a model of an observation
*Vordox is very into this discussion, SPONGE MODE
<Science_Brony> How much SCIENCE(!!!!1!!1) did I miss?
<CriticKitten> So outside of those circumstances, they stop being true.
<Saturn> 08,01a theory is an explanation of why that model fits the observation
<Vordox> Science_Brony: About....25+ pages
<panda-drawing> Saturn, Nittany_Discord, may i learn from you? ^-^
<Lightning-Quill> Let's just theorize that food
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are some materials that don't obey Ohms law at all.
<Saturn> 08,01cleared up for you?
<Science_Brony> Vordox o_O
<Vordox> Indeed Saturn
<Vordox> Science_Brony: You missed ALOT, the very FOUNDATIONS of Science has been shaken :P
<Science_Brony> Saturn fact is proven theory
<prince-dari> And what everyone should take away from this is that 0.999... != 1
<prince-dari> :D
<hen3ry> a theory is never "proven"
<Vordox> Lawl prince-dari XD
<owlicious> damn it prince-dari.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,010.9999... = 1.
<hen3ry> it's merely accepted in the absense of contrary examples.
<Petrified_Discord> prince-dari: MOTHERFU-
<Saturn> 08,01Science_Brony: id say "accepted science", because fact is too rigid
<Saturn> 08,01science changes
<hen3ry> I find one real particle able to exceed the speed of light, and I disprove Einstein.
<Petrified_Discord> hen3ry: You wouldn't be the first...
<Science_Brony> Nittany_Discord no. 0.999... is infinitely close to 1, but never reaches it
<Vordox> That's the part that confuses me the most, Saturn. :) But it makes sense but at the same time, it's just..bleh
<Science_Brony> therefore, 0.999... < 1
<Litwick> IVE BEEN ALONE FOR SO LONG
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Math theorems show an exact equation.
<Saturn> 08,01for example, it was thought for ages that ovaries only have a certain amount of eggs
<hen3ry> No, it is exactly equal.
<Litwick> BUT NOW IVE FOUND YOU
*Petrified_Discord slaps Science_Brony "NO"
<Vordox> AND THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION Came from fucking Pi. XD
<owlicious> don't they?
<hen3ry> Math proves it, your brain refuses to accept it
<Saturn> 08,01but this was proved false a few months ago
<CriticKitten> Nitt: That's because science is just the inflated form of math. :P
<Litwick> Good god that line of dialogue will give me nightmares for months.
<hen3ry> Science Marches On.
<Unnr> Vordox, if you ever get bored, try to track down a copy of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Khun
<Saturn> 08,01so now the accepted science has to be changed, anmd the textbooks rewritten
<CriticKitten> Or alternatively: math is the purest science.
<XAX> Phase4: u busy?
<Vordox> Will do unnr
<Saturn> 08,01this also happens a lot in cosmology
*Science_Brony punches Petrified_Discord in the nuts "YES!!"
<Vordox> Saturn: Well Cosmology is just a heap of questions mostly.
<Unnr> Its a bit wordy at times, but is a good introduction to how accepted science ¨fact¨changes over time
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: ha! yes...
<CrimsonPhoenix> KERBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
<Litwick> Oh god stream scared the sht out of me
<Kandarihu> Stream!
<Vordox> wtf sounds Phase4 ?
<hen3ry> Biology is based on Biochemistry. Biochemistry is applied Organic Chemistry, which itself is simply Chemistry of Carbon. Chemistry is a special case of Physics, and Physics is just Math.
<Phase4> 00,02lol CrimsonPhoenix
*Saturn 08,01used to be an astrophysicist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phase4!
<Science_Brony> SCIENCE!!!
<Zawan> Space
<Spriggals> MY EARS
<owlicious> wait, he streams
<owlicious> ?
<EonMastor> suddenly! Sound!
<AttackAndalite> Dat sound
<otakon> MY EARS!
<Irish_Pony> SO MANY PINGS!!!
<Science_Brony> I mean STREAM!!!
<Midnight_Splendor> What is that sound
<Petrified_Discord> Science_Brony: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5522/
<Lightning-Quill> sounds like cancer
<Phase4> 00,02oh god sound
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can dance to that
<Celes_Chere> Pingception?
<Phase4> 00,02i broke it didnt i
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Physics is not math.
<Vordox> What have you done Phase4 ? XD
<otakon> Phase4: MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP!
<owlicious> wubwubwub
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Trust me.
<Kandarihu> Something sounds messed up.
<Phase4> 00,02STOP BUTTON Y U NO WORK
<AttackAndalite> Ohay Phase4
<Honey_Sprinkles> HOLY CRAP I HAD A HEART ATTACK
*otakon 's head explodes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Physics is lazy math at best.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6lol
<Kandarihu> Feedback maybe?
<Unnr> Recently got a new camera, so behold! Kitty! http://imgur.com/a/2kvwl
<EonMastor> someone remix that sound
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: i know; i suck at maths
<Zawan> thank you buffer
<otakon> Unnr: neat!
<Saturn> 08,01i dont suck at physics
<Midnight_Splendor> Physics is math that just uses letters.
*AttackAndalite cleans up the otakon splatter
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Math is just a way for us to translate the Science of Physics into understandable terms. *Shrug*
<hen3ry> Lazy Math is Best Math.
<Honey_Sprinkles> Thank you bronystate.
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what happened there
<otakon> Unnr: kitty looks peeved
<Honey_Sprinkles> OH GOD
<Saturn> 08,01rhis is how i diffeentiate the two
<Science_Brony> Nittany_Discord Math and Physics are similar. Also, Math is a sun-category of Science
<Lightning-Quill> That was creepy
<Science_Brony> hi kirzstryfe
<Honey_Sprinkles> Is he playing garrys mod?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Physics is not math.
<Honey_Sprinkles> Or hl2?
<Vordox> Wait...Sun-Category Science_Brony ?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: you were pinged and it went through the stream for ever
<Science_Brony> Nittany_Discord they are closely related
<Unnr> Physics is maths when you have a point to all the numbers
<Petrified_Discord> Math is the language of science
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You need to get deep into both like I have.
<Honey_Sprinkles> I heard those sounds from there
<Science_Brony> Vordox sub-category
<Phase4> 00,02goddamnit
<Vordox> Ah
<prince-dari> So Nittany_Discord
<Phase4> 00,02what shappening
<owlicious> Phase4: gahh
<prince-dari> The proof you used earlier was
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have a physics degree and almost minored in math.
<prince-dari> x = 0.9...
<Ponies47> brb
<Phase4> 00,02is it still doing it?
<CriticKitten> Physics is math, Nitt. It's just what happens when you take math and bloat it significantly. :p
<Vordox> Phase4: Restart Firefox
<prince-dari> 10x = 9.9...
<Ryunosuke> physics = science, math - science thush physics = math :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was someone else's proof.
<Kandarihu> It's just beeping repeatedly every time you get pinged
<prince-dari> 9x = 9
<owlicious> wubwubwub
<prince-dari> x = 1
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<prince-dari> Therefore 0.9... = 1
<Phase4> 00,02is that better?
<Unnr> otakon: Kitty was napping, then had some twit with a camera flashing her. >_>
<superretroworld> you have a weird version of bronystate
<Vordox> Phase4: No pings anymore
<Science_Brony> Phase4 much better
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You made an assumption at step 3 dari.
<prince-dari> But...
<otakon> Unnr: ah, that explains the peeve
<Science_Brony> Vordox pong
<Vordox> Nope it's back XD
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> all this science and math talk has broke Phase4 s stream
<prince-dari> Yeah
<Science_Brony> FFFFFUUUUUUUUU-
<prince-dari> Exactly
<prince-dari> That's why that's not a proof.
<prince-dari> :D
<Ryunosuke> you realize... bronies talking about physics has been done right? :)
<Vordox> prince-dari: You caused this whole heaven and hell of Science and math hell. :P Congrats.
<Phase4> 00,02lolwut
<Lightning-Quill> Yeah
<Science_Brony> Ryunosuke SCIENCE!!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02its OUTPUTTING to the vac device
<Honey_Sprinkles> If I hear that sound one more time I might get a real heart attack.
<Science_Brony> o_O
<Kandarihu> What's the purpose of that Audio Repeater, if not to do exactly that?
<Phase4> 00,02but i told ot to go to speakers
<Science_Brony> O_o
<Science_Brony> <_<
<Science_Brony> >_>
<otakon> Honey_Sprinkles: mute your stream until I tell you otherwise
<Lightning-Quill> It is everywhere
<Phase4> 00,02windows bugs
<Science_Brony> ^_^
<Honey_Sprinkles> Oh ok.
<hen3ry> what assumption?
<Science_Brony> <_<
<Science_Brony> >_>
<Phase4> 00,02if you enable/disable audio devices at the wrong time the repeater gets confused
<Phase4> 00,02that shoudl be better now
<Science_Brony> -_(\
<Saturn> 08,01Ryunosuke: some of us in here are more qualified to discuss physics, literally
<Vordox> prince-dari: This all happened due to you asking about the god damn "pi" was a number when it's proven to not be a number due to it being irrational, and basing the very term of it to be acceptable when a number cannot be finalized. =P
<Ryunosuke> Phase4, check your pm
<Ponies47> back
<prince-dari> <:
<Honey_Sprinkles> Forest gump lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01x = 0.999... , 10x = 9.9...., 10x - 9.9... = 9.9 - 9.9 = 0 therefore x = 1? (Which I see a fault).
<hen3ry> Ok, try this.
<Lightning-Quill> Please don't. I prefer if it is started at the beginning if explained
<Science_Brony> Vordox it is impossible to prove or disprove any number to be irrational
*Unnr almost minored in physics, but ended up with Biochem and a minor in EECS
<CriticKitten> Saturn: Just some of us? :p
<hen3ry> 1/9 = 0.111... multiply each side by 9.
<Phase4> 00,02Ryunosuke, we've probably all seen that
*owlicious facehooves
<Phase4> 00,02and i has game to play
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i have this whole rant about the Halting Problem and Effective Computability just lined up for you
<owlicious> do you mean all numbers
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: so ask me about it when im on a sensible computer next
<Ryunosuke> ya
<Petrified_Discord> Vordox: Pi may not be a rational number, but it is a real number, unlike the square root of -1 which is a rational number but not a real one ("real" in the mathematical sense and not the literal)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Another one is 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 0.333... + 0.333... + 0.333... = 0.9999.... = 1.
<Ryunosuke> probbably
<Vordox> Science_Brony: I know, but yet you still use it, while not being final to get an answer that's closest as possible when you search for other mathemathical
<Ryunosuke> still... PHYSICS, HOW DOES IT WORK
<Ryunosuke> :p
<hen3ry> you're getting tripped up on the idea that there an "infinitieth" digit. There isn't.
<Science_Brony> an irrational number has no pattern and continues without pattern for infinity. HOWEVER, it is impossible to count to infinity
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It does.
<Phase4> 00,02stream working?
*owlicious gets torch
<Litwick> What the hell is this?
<Science_Brony> a number can be proven rational, but not irrational
<prince-dari> You're making the assumption that it does
<EspyLacopa> .9999- Repeating. There -is- a method by which you can show any repeating decimal as a fraction.
<Ryunosuke> no it doest
<Science_Brony> LOGIC!!!
<Phase4> 00,02prince-dari, 1/3 ~/ 0.333
<Unnr> <3 coutnable vs uncountable infinities
<Phase4> 00,02~='
<EspyLacopa> When you apply that method to .99999-, you get 1.
<Ryunosuke> 1/3 of 1 does = .333~
<Unnr> *Countable
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Long division says 1/3 = 0.333...
<Saturn> 08,01Science_Brony: well, there are countable infinities
<Honey_Sprinkles> Why does stream lag so hard?
<Ryunosuke> but... 1/3 or 3 = 1
<Lightning-Quill> Hey can you play a scary game? I kind of want to jump a little or at least have something try and make me jump
<prince-dari> If you assume 1/3 = 0.333... then you are automatically saying 1 = 0.999...
<Science_Brony> Phase4 1/3= o.333...
<Sumica> 00,10Pi is exactly 3!
<Petrified_Discord> Science_Brony: Logic merely enables one to be wrong with authority
<Vordox> Wait...Countable infinite? HOW THE FUCK?!
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, D:
<hen3ry> heh
<prince-dari> Proof 1/3 = 0.333...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,011/3 = 0.3333... is shown by long division.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: *gasp*
<prince-dari> Prove it :P
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Sumica: :O
<Science_Brony> Saturn here's a question: How large is infinity?
*Ponies47 Brain explodes
<owlicious> it depends
<EspyLacopa> Irrational Numbers are such because they cannot be expressed as the division between two whole numbers.
<prince-dari> Infinity is a theoretical number
<Unnr> Science_Brony: Which?
<prince-dari> It has no size
<Honey_Sprinkles> Play amnesia. Get cursed by teleporting naked guys.
<owlicious> there are infinite different sizes of infinity
<Petrified_Discord> Science_Brony: Depends. How large is a mathematical concept?
<Saturn> 08,01Science_Brony: infinity comes in different sizes
<Vordox> Why did I laugh at that Science_Brony .. :P
<owlicious> infinity of rational numbers is same as integers but different from reals
<Litwick> Well guys its confirmed. Chris Hoffman of Ninten do Power is a brony.
<otakon> prince-dari: it has no beginning and no end.
<JRP2234[Web]> infinity isent a number
<otakon> oooh what is this?
<Saturn> 08,01Science_Brony: you can have one infinity provably larger than another
<hen3ry> alephs.
<owlicious> e.g. Cantor's diagonalization argument
<Honey_Sprinkles> What game is this?
<EspyLacopa> Looks like Myst.
<otakon> no idea
<Sumica> 00,10Oh hey, Phase4 is playing that screen shot game

<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, eyup
<Science_Brony> I'm scienced out for tonight.
<Vordox> I wish to have exactness, not things based on very unproven theories that are "facts" for the general population.

<AttackAndalite> Night, stt
<EspyLacopa> Interesting method: If A != B, then (A+B)/2 = C, wherein C is a different number.
<AttackAndalite> Night, Saturn*
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: better question who DOESN'T like muffins?
<Kandarihu> Well, not everything is provable or disprovable.
<EspyLacopa> And C would be in the middle between A and B.
<otakon> OH GOD MATH!
<otakon> IT BURNS!
<Lunar_Brony> otakon Communists. They also hate toast
<EspyLacopa> So. . .what number is between 1 and .9~
<Biglaw> SuperBrony64! I finished it :)
<Vordox> EspyLacopa: I KNOW!
<owlicious> .9~5, which is absurd.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01prince-dari: You never proved that 1/3 =/= 0.3333....
<EspyLacopa> Ah, but the 9 repeats to infinity.
<EspyLacopa> There is no 5.
<owlicious> right, that's why i say absurd
<Vordox> EspyLacopa: x = 1/0.9
<Lunar_Brony> Cowbell?
<Kandarihu> Is this Real Myst?
<prince-dari> 0.333... != 1/3 automatically if 1 != 0.999...
<hen3ry> That would still have to be a number between 0.999... and exactly 1.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,010.999... = 1 though.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Biglaw: AWESOME :D
<hen3ry> such a number cannot exist.
<Vordox> NOW comes the shock here....
<prince-dari> There is no proof
<Lunar_Brony> Air Compression releasing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> what is this game?
<Vordox> SCIENCE gets us CLOSE to what we want, but it CANNOT give us the exact.
<prince-dari> 1 = 0.999... + 0.0...1
<prince-dari> :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Look up proof. I can't type proof into IRC.

<Vordox> Dat Science Kandarihu
<otakon> WAIT!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> just kick
<otakon> it was an accident!
<Lunar_Brony> /)_(\
<otakon> DON'T BAN HIM!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> otakon: we
<prince-dari> He's not getting banned.
<prince-dari> :P
<superretroworld> i think it was just 33 1/2
<otakon> oh Good
<Lightning-Quill> come on baby kick do the cupid shuffle
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ya coulda just said repeating idiot
<hen3ry> No it was 33 1/3.
<Lunar_Brony> brb
<EspyLacopa> Assumptions are part of how math works, though.
<CrimsonPhoenix> argument over a joke?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SERIOUSLY why are we talking about this?
<Vordox> Still, I know the answer to science, why we have science, and why we cannot live without it :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> and WHAT GAME IS THIS?
<SlurryMoon> 3otakon, I'm sorry, but we're now banning all people we kick now. Dari is just trying to make it easier on you.
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: is best at lost
<EspyLacopa> You break the method by showing how either an assumption is wrong, or how it was applied was wrong.
<prince-dari> XD SlurryMoon
<Ponies47> SlurryMoon: O_O
<prince-dari> EspyLacopa: Yes, all maths is based on some fundamental basic assumptions
<Reikim> O_o
<SlurryMoon> 3I hope you don't get spam kicked ota
<prince-dari> But I say those assumptions are wrong.
<Kandarihu> I really had no idea that X-Chat was going to do that.
<Phase4> 00,02ohai SlurryMoon
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: But I get kicked all the time...
<SlurryMoon> 3x3
<prince-dari> Whatcha gunna do now?
<prince-dari> <:
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, what game is this?
<EspyLacopa> Can't really do much of anything.
<Phase4> 00,02CrimsonPhoenix, realMyst
<SlurryMoon> 3and hello Phase4 :3
<prince-dari> AHAHAHAHAHa
<CrimsonPhoenix> ooooooh
<otakon> SlurryMoon: that's like wishing for rain in the Mohave
<hen3ry> at this point, write you off as a troll xD
<otakon> hiya SlurryMoon
<Reikim> prince-dari: iirc, all math is based on the single assumption that all statements are either true or false, and goes on from there.
<prince-dari> ALL OF MODERN MATHS WILL FALL BEFORE ME
<Sumica> 00,10Ingnore you as you make them all the time any ways Dari
<CrimsonPhoenix> fullscreen heh?
<Vordox> Reikim: YES
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: you seem .....FUCKING CLUELESS to what ur doin
<EspyLacopa> If you truly believe so, and can -prove- that they are. . .Then spread it so that the collective knowledge of math becomes better.
<EspyLacopa> That is how science works.
<prince-dari> Sumica: Oh u
<superretroworld> why is the streamers version of bronystate so different?
<Vordox> EspyLacopa: So it's like Linux?
<Unnr> JRP2234[Web]: its the minecart puzzle
<Unnr> its a bit... evil
<Reikim> I think we can all assume that all statements are either true or false?
<Unnr> not as bad as the rocket later, but still evil
<prince-dari> Reikim: I disagree.
<Kandarihu> superretroworld, there's a bit of a delay from the streamer's computer to mips.tv to all of our computers.
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234[Web], not quite
<Phase4> 00,02i have an idea
<Reikim> prince-dari: On what grounds?
<Lightning-Quill> I think he is getting angry
<owlicious> No, godel hates you.
<Phase4> 00,02just not much
<prince-dari> Isn't there that thing
<superretroworld> oh
<Vordox> prince-dari: Math is made so we can have an exactness, Correct?
*Honey_Sprinkles opens the little mini bar coke falls out gets scared that sis gonna wake up knowing I stayed up this late. My sister turns I get scared *SNORE*
<Vordox> Simple what + what becomes what. =P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: EXACTLY
<prince-dari> With Schrödinger's cat.
<Honey_Sprinkles> Lol
<prince-dari> Where it's both dead and alive at the same time.
<prince-dari> Something can be true and false at the same time.
<Reikim> prince-dari: That's philosophy, not mathematics.
<Vordox> Prick: Until proven =P
<hen3ry> that was just an excuse he used to justify killing cats.
<Kandarihu> It seems especially pronounced when Phase4 is streaming. He's in Australia.
<Kandarihu> hen3ry, Portal 2 ftw
<Vordox> prince-dari: Until Proven
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i know a australian <3
<Honey_Sprinkles> I'm leaving the stream is getting a little "Boring" and I want to go play some games.
<JRP2234[Web]> i know many
<Phase4> 00,02^ Kandarihu
<owlicious> I think Schrodinger gave that example as an absurd conclusion of quantum mechanics and many world theory or something
<Phase4> 00,02too many things start with ka
<owlicious> or he hates cats. i forget which
<Honey_Sprinkles> Bye everyone and have fun enjoying the stream or doing something else.
<pony_4234> is the cat alive or dead
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase what are you playing?
<Shamroc> Phase4: have you died yet?
<owlicious> yes
<prince-dari> Now what should I do, I 've destroyed maths.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yes the cat is dead and alive
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> prince-dari: how?
<Vordox> prince-dari: Indeed not you have
<Reikim> Phase4: Anyway, the cat isn't really both dead and alive. From our perspective it might as well be either, because we don't know. But the cat is one or the other, and saying "the cat is dead" or "the cat is alive" will be correspondingly true or false depending on the cat's state.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Bai Honey_Sprinkles come back any time
<Vordox> prince-dari: If I wanted an answer, I would open the box :P
<Reikim> Oh wait I pinged Phase4 when I was supposed to ping prince-dari
<Reikim> =.(\
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh this is Myst
<Vordox> prince-dari: I got to admit though, this has been a interesting chat from various perspectives. No doubt one of the most fun, and learning, chat I've been in a long time
<Vordox> I still say the same thing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> and annoying sometimes
<Reikim> Agreed, but the cat still isn't proof that mathematics is invalid.
<Vordox> Science is a close answer, but never the correct one.
<Reikim> Vordox: Oh, is that the problem? Your problem is that you think of Science as ANSWERS.
<Sumica> 00,10seems to be made of rust
<Vordox> Reikim: In our world, there is either true or false.
<AdamTheDuck> Today's forcast: a 70% chance of science
<Vordox> However, science cannot give us the answers.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> it can
<Reikim> Vordox: Those two sentences are so far from each other that I don't even
<Vordox> No, it can only give us the closest possible
<xxMoopyxx> theres like nobody in that game
<Kandarihu> I agree with Reikim on Schrodinger's cat's theory. The only redeeming factor to that theory is the memetic quality.
<Sumica> 00,10Science gave me a heavy backpack
<Vordox> memetic?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Science gave me a freaking headache
<Reikim> Vordox: Science is not the work of providing answers to questions.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Geometric series sum: s = a/(1 - r). (look up geometric series). You can cast 0.9999... as 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + ... = 0.9 * (1 + 1/10 + 1/100...), or a geometric sum where a = 0.9 and r = 0.1. Put that in the sum formula I gave, that gives 0.999.... = 1.
<Lightning-Quill> Science interests me
<Reikim> Vordox: Science is the work of observing the way the universe works around us.
<prince-dari> Science only brings up more questions.
<Kandarihu> I saw an image macro reading Schrodinger's gonna kill you like a cat in a box... or not.
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, the point of the cat is we dont know if its dead of alive
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> prince-dari: and it can give answers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The sum formula has been proven, so there you go.
<Phase4> 00,02and we CANT know untill we open the box
<Reikim> Vordox: And as dari has stated quite accurately, it tends to raise more questions than answers.
<EspyLacopa> >_>
<Vordox> Reikim: But we're using a mathematical terms and solutions for it, but Math is exact, while Reality is not. Well our realit
<Lightning-Quill> What is this box you speak of?
<Reikim> Phase4: Yes, but dari was using it to disprove mathematics, which it doesn't.
<EspyLacopa> Proof that 1 = 2
<EspyLacopa> A = B :: Multiply both sides by A
<EspyLacopa> AA = BA :: Subtract BB
<EspyLacopa> AA-BB = BA-BB :: Factor both sides
<EspyLacopa> (A-B)(A+B) = B(A-B) :: Divide out (A-B)
<Reikim> Thanks dari
<Phase4> 00,02its not both dead and alive, its one of the other, but because we cant observe it, its in a state where its effectively both
<Bronysith> FUND IT FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA FUND IT http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-portal-to-equestria.jpg
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yay always the worse accuaracy!
<prince-dari> Gimme a minute Nittany_Discord
<prince-dari> I'll disprove it. :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Bronysith: >.>
<EspyLacopa> Second Half:
<EspyLacopa> A+B = B :: Observe that A = B
<EspyLacopa> B+B = B :: Combine terms on left
<EspyLacopa> 2B = B :: Divine non-zero B
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ugn.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Ugh
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> prince-dari: you cant use google tho :P
<Reikim> Phase4: Effectively, from our perspective, but on a universal level it is one or the other.
<EspyLacopa> Thus, 2 = 1
<Phase4> 00,02an infninite series of 9's is infinitely close to one
<Reikim> Welcome back. We're arguing math and science.
<Kandarihu> How does our lack of observation affect the state that the cat is in?
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, its a metaphore
<Phase4> 00,02i spell bad
<EspyLacopa> It's a fairly simple error in the 1=2 proof.
<Phase4> 00,02in reality there exist particals that simply do not have state untill you interact with them
<Reikim> Schrodinger's cat is a philosophical excercise. It shouldn't be taken as a proof of anything.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and that's my cue out :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish I could get paid for this.
<Vordox> Reikim: I'll say this, Science is close possible, Math is Exact, you're trying to mix both = Causing chaos. =P
<panda-drawing> Dammit whe did otakon leave???????
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Reikim: i agree
<Meanwhile> I'm surprised I had any accuracy at all given that I spent most of the game harassing witches with a shotgun.
<panda-drawing> When*
<EspyLacopa> At least it isn't a crawling chaos.
<Reikim> Vordox: Science isn't about giving answers! Science is about observation!

<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-totally-worth-it.jpg
<Reikim> Vordox: Science is the observation of Nature, while mathematics is the study of numbers. They are not equivalent.
<superretroworld> science is about confusing the fuck outta you
<Vordox> Reikim: But why do everyone turn to Science for answers?
<EspyLacopa> Direction you have to follow in this part of Myst is based on the sound you hear when you reach each intersection.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: technology advancements
<Vordox> Reikim: But we are using Math for it, for example physics.
<Phase4> 00,02so ding meens north and splurg meens left
<Meanwhile> Except for the couple I set off by accident.
<Phase4> 00,02west'
<Reikim> Vordox: Because for many questions, the best answer is achieved through observation. And mathematics just happens to coordinate well with the way the universe works.
<UnknownGlaze> Haaaaai
<UnknownGlaze> ll
<UnknownGlaze> lol
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-dont-get-it.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't get jobs in retail because I have non-existent social skills. I'm fucked.
<Reikim> Vordox: Science is not about giving answers to anything. Science is about studying the universe, often through investigating a specific question.
<Phase4> 00,02and then suddenly sound changes
<Phase4> 00,02:/
<Vordox> Reikim: ... Weird
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Nittany, with some of the people I work with, you don't particularly need social skills to work retail
<panda-drawing> Nittany_Discord :( same here... but you gotta try ^-^
<UnknownGlaze> Wait, what the hay are we watching?
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: i has finished new song
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And don't get me started on assessment surveys.
<mitamaking> Am I watching the chat?
<Vordox> Science is a mess. ._.
<Vordox> It's like a belief based on things that exist but we cannot prove it.
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> Wait that sounds familiar
<Reikim> Vordox: A lot of people don't understand what science actually means. Unfortunately, this includes a lot of scientists.
<AdamTheDuck> is this the part where we all watch a MLP episode together and stop arguing what science is?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01kirzstryfe: I need them to lie on assessment surveys (or do I need less anxiety)?
<mitamaking> Well we can prov esome science
<mitamaking> *prove some
<panda-drawing> Nittany_Discord well.. wanna know what helps me?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> if you say MLP ill slap you >.<
<Reikim> Vordox: Look, if I really wanted to, I could claim that nothing can be completely proven and that the universe's very existence is questionable.
<Vordox> Reikim: Isn't it?
<Reikim> Vordox: All things are based upon belief eventually. Including your beloved mathematics.
<AdamTheDuck> but i cbs writing it all fully :P
<panda-drawing> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG directed at me?
<Vordox> Reikim: ....

<panda-drawing> otakon! Ur back! Help!
<Vordox> Reikim: Are you saying Math is not exact?
<mitamaking> Vordox: Where is the fun in claiming nothing is real, if you believe that why not just kill yourself?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yes panda-drawing
<otakon> panda-drawing: what?
<panda-drawing> otakon i need ur OC again! Stat!
<Merc_Xephos> hello
<Reikim> Vordox: Math is based upon assumptions. Granted, they are simpler than most, but they are still assumptions.
<Vordox> mitamaking: Hell no, living is too fun :P
<otakon> panda-drawing: okay, hold on
<panda-drawing> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG no... that doesnt really help here...
<CriticKitten> Vordox: I think I see where you're trying to go but I hope I'm wrong. Because if you're trying to argue that science and religion are functionally equal because both are based on "belief", I'm honestly not sure what to say to that.
<mitamaking> If you are living some things have to be real
<Reikim> Vordox: And even with math there is the inexact, and things we jsut can't investigate.
<Vordox> Reikim: But it's based on an abstractness, therefor math is an exact.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My mom gives me an article on why my meteo degree was a waste of time. Real supportive, mom!!!!
<Reikim> Vordox: ...You're claiming that an abstraction is exact? Okaaaay...
<otakon> http://postimage.org/image/65fecvohr/ panda-drawing
<Vordox> Reikim: Indeed, cause the abstraction was made to have an exactness.
<mitamaking> Can't we prove science with math, but not religion, unless fractals were done by a higher power
<Bronysith> if you are a fan of SOUL EATER http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-mustache-is-uneven.jpg
<Vordox> Reikim: Math is a exact science..or law we can call it
<Reikim> Vordox: Now you're starting to sound like every other priest I've met.
<panda-drawing> otakon arigato gozaimasu!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She won't answer my phone texts, but she'll condescend my grad school decision and all of the shit I went through.
<otakon> panda-drawing: np
<Vordox> Reikim: Math is an abstract understanding to prove things.
<mitamaking> Can we agree on evolution?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dudd that's not right
<Reikim> Vordox: Even math is inexact in places.
<panda-drawing> otakon hm... give me about 45 minutes for lining and such ^-^
<prince-dari> Hm, to disprove it I think I need to find the derivation for the equation s = a/(1-r)
<otakon> panda-drawing: no worries man
<prince-dari> Because it's based on some assumption, but I don't know what it is
<CriticKitten> Nitt: Meteorology?
<Vordox> But once we incorporate terms from science into Math it causes a differentialty, therefor "destroying" the very basis of why math exists.
<mitamaking> Well 2+2 always equals 4
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<owlicious> it assumes -1 < r < 1
<Merc_Xephos> wut is dis?
<Vordox> This includes numbers like Pi, M, E, S etc etc
<Reikim> I
<Reikim> What
<Quick_Thinker> the hay is this game?
<CriticKitten> Nitt: Ah. That's a vicious field from what I've heard.
<Reikim> I'm not even following anymore.
<owlicious> prince-dari: it assumes -1 < r < 1 , i think
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: Real Myst
<Reikim> How does it destroy math
<otakon> the math it BURNS ME
<Reikim> I don't even
<mitamaking> I thought for sure you were going to say i Vordox
<wicked> sup yall:)
<otakon> you can't
<Vordox> Reikim: Math is a exact abstraction, it HAS answers, Correct and simple, Fact answers.
<CriticKitten> Nitt: I had a friend who was going into it, but bailed. Couldn't handle the course work. Props to you for completing it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There's an article about five degrees that are wastes of time to obtain grad versions of (Fucking suck at wording). Atmospheric science is one of them.
<Reikim> Vordox: Square root of negative one.
<Merc_Xephos> :'( no one responds to me
<Lightning-Quill> there ain't no rest for the wicked :D
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: wait, study of the weather basically right?
<otakon> Merc_Xephos: you haven't said anything, plus math.
<Vordox> Which is what Reikim ?
<AdamTheDuck> Merc_Xephos The game is Myst
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Pi is a mathematical concept.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<CriticKitten> I don't know how you figure that it's not.
<Prick> wait MYST?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Pi was based of the science of Circles, correct? =P
<Reikim> Vordox: Which is a logical impossibility. Therefore mathematicians throw their arms in the air and call it i.
<Merc_Xephos> I HAVE TALKED BUT EVERYPONY IGNORES ME
<mitamaking> Pi can be proven if we ever get to the end of it
<CriticKitten> "science" of circles?
<Vordox> Correct.
<CriticKitten> >implying that circles aren't mathematical
<CriticKitten> >geometry
<Reikim> Vordox: What part of that is exact?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have a bachelors in Physics and masters in Meteorology.
<Vordox> mitamaking: Correct, Mita.
<Vordox> Reikim: Which one? I'm having 3 convos at once here
<Lightning-Quill> HI merc sorry I'm daydreaming
<AdamTheDuck> Merx_Xephos yeah but we're all busy getting our minds blown by this ongoing argument
<mitamaking> Until then we just take it as working
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But having anxiety issues that are hurting me making money.
<Reikim> Vordox: Square root of negative one.
<CriticKitten> So yeah, that's kind of a dumb thing to say. Circles are geometric, thus math. Pi is a mathematical number.
<Reikim> Vordox: Anyway, I think we should stop here because otherwise I'm going to start delving into the philosophy of questions.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-a-not-so-bad-time.jpg
<Vordox> Reikim: That's where I live :P
<prince-dari> Ok, so the sum of 0.9*0.1^r from r to infinity = 0.9*(1-0.1^infinity/1-0.1)
<mitamaking> Here is my deal, there may be a higher power, but religion got it wrong, he is hands off except when he created stuff, that is the only higher power I can even except as possible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And mom posts this in PM in facebook: http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2012/06/14/five-graduate-degrees-that-dont-pay-off/
<Reikim> Vordox: What is a question? What question are we asking? What's the right question to ask? How can we be sure of an answer
<prince-dari> Therefore the proof you used works under the assumption that a 0.1^infinity = 0
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Geometric is not a science that got incorporated to math?
<Reikim> Dammit my universe is falling apart again.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's like "Gee! Wasted your time there. You should have gone to work!"
<prince-dari> So unless you can prove that, the proof is invalid.
<prince-dari> :D
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-hey-what-else-are-minions-good-for1.png
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Instead of grad school.
<mitamaking> Now math, like I said 2+2 always equals 4, I know that my blood is red, etc.
<lyncast> Guess Whois back!
<Bronysith> lyncast: back again
<lyncast> Yup
<brony2themoon> whats going on
<mitamaking> What is this game, seems dull?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks mom!
<prince-dari> So, anyone want to prove that 0.1^infinity = 0?
<brony2themoon> what are we watching
<CriticKitten> Vordox: WHAT?!? Geometry is a core field of mathematics. You cannot be serious right now.
<lyncast> I has news from my old roommate
<AdamTheDuck> We are all watching a game called Myst
<Vordox> Geometric is based on forms that are already proven to be impossible to hamper out due to that base of the math for exacting the formulas that come from Pi causes the answer to be false.
<Derpy_Hooves> night pon ies
<mitamaking> This is Myst, man it seems dull
<brony2themoon> what is about
<Shizuka> 13ahh the mazerunner
<lyncast> He went to a Texas meet up while I was confined on post
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess I fucked my brain up from Lithium for nothing.
<Reikim> prince-dari: It's infinitely close but it never reaches. Asymptote at y = 0.
<otakon> hiya Shizuka
<Derpy_Hooves> night friends~
<lyncast> Dari lives?
<prince-dari> Reikim: If you're saying that, you're saying that 1 != 0.9...
<CriticKitten> ....okay, now say that again but in English, Vordox.
<Bronysith> night Derpy_Hooves
<otakon> lyncast: yeah he's alive
<prince-dari> Ohai lyncast
<otakon> night Derpy_Hooves sleep well
<mitamaking> Vordox: Isn't that only circles?
<Reikim> prince-dari: I'm saying that.
<lyncast> Yay
<prince-dari> So you're with me, us against the world Reikim? :P
<lyncast> And so far I haven't been banned again
<prince-dari> 1 = 0.9...
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Math started out as an exactness, but the more we got terms into it based on non exact answers, including Pi etc etc, the answers became not exactness
<lyncast> Things seem to be going well
<Vordox> It's the way how we adapted Math.
<mitamaking> prince-dari: so wrong
<CriticKitten> Vordox: That's nonsense.
<Lightning-Quill> This game seems evil
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Geometry is a core math.
<Reikim> prince-dari: I'm not sure what branch of math claims that. I mean, it's infinitely close so it might as well be equivalent, but it isn't.
<prince-dari> So we have established 1 != 0.9...
<CriticKitten> Vordox: It's not an "evolved" fake science.
<otakon> lyncast: well it's not like you come in that often and no trouble so why bother?
<Bronysith> DAMN IT DANIEL INGRAM http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-poor-guy-daniel.jpg
<mitamaking> Vordox: It doesn't mean all math is wrong though
<AttackAndalite> Nittany_Discord: Have you tried reasoning with your mother?
<lyncast> Because my laptop has no wifi
<Vordox> mitamaking: Never said that, only with terms that has no exact answer.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Geometry is the mathematics of physical constructs. >_>
<Reikim> Vordox: Look, I love math, but life is inherently inexact. And please don't claim that math gives "answers". That particular bit depends on what question you're asking.
<otakon> lyncast: wait if it has no wifi how are you here?
<lyncast> Also, mini applejack met my roommate!
<mitamaking> Are you sure, you seem to be all about proving math=religion
<Vordox> Reikim: Aye I know.
<lyncast> Phone
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Distance, shape, etc.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Doubt I can reason with her.
<Vordox> mitamaking: Never said that, math if anything, was created on the abstract idea of being exact
<otakon> lyncast: ah, well your roomate I remember (poor fellow) but who is mini applejack?
<lyncast> RAwr!
<CriticKitten> Vordox: So it's impossible for you to suggest that geometry is some sort of "fake" math evolved from science.
<AttackAndalite> Nittany_Discord: That sucks. Does anyone else in your family support you at least?
<Vordox> But over time, due to it evolving, it became more and more about getting the most possible closest answer, which is nice and all, but...
<lyncast> A guy who goes here
<mitamaking> It's over, he/she's out
<otakon> ah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone supports me.
<Vordox> Depending on of course where the formula is used.
<otakon> lyncast: well you've been doing well lately yes?
<Reikim> Vordox: Just going to say this because I can...your world is built on the assumption that your sensory inputs are all true.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I think coldly posting that is derogatory.
<hen3ry> I have a new paradox
<Phase4> 00,02feels good man
<lyncast> Betcha diddnt know my roommate is an army medic too! But different company :(
<hen3ry> hen3ry's omelette is either runny or burnt, and you can't tell until you get the salmonella
<lyncast> He joined with me!
<Vordox> Reikim: I have no solid evidence of that. For my reality is within those senses, yes
<Shamroc> Phase4: lovein the cart....lol
<EspyLacopa> So, did Phase leave that myst world without bringing back a Red or Blue page?
<XAX> Phase4 should come play CSS.
<Lightning-Quill> Satan book
<lyncast> Got to basic around same time I did, I was so happy to hear he got the same post as me
<Phase4> 00,02EspyLacopa, i got a blue page
<AttackAndalite> Nittany_Discord: Well try not to worry about it too much, even though that's hard to do. If you have the support of everyone else, then you schould ontinue doing what YOU want to do
<Vordox> Reikim: But you see where my point is?
<mitamaking> I think philosophy is a joke field actually, so yeah, this argument...
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, NUUUU, MORE MYST
<Vordox> Reikim: Wether it's right or wrong.
<Reikim> Vordox: Okay. Just dumping that because it's my standard method of screwing around with people's brains, and I wanted to check and see if it worked on everyone.
<XAX> Phase4: okayface.jpeg
<Reikim> Vordox: Unfortunately no because I haven't been here until recently.
<Lightning-Quill> Philosophy helped define who we are today
<Ponies47> Computer derp back -_-
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase4: lol, you should play some zombie escape with me if you finish with myst =P
<Vordox> Reikim: Sorry, but...the reality of mine is the reality of mine, doesn't mean the world's reality is ...
<lyncast> SuperBrony64: Hay babe!
<otakon> lyncast: you might want to get out of here for now eh?
<Reikim> Vordox: Dump it in PM with a bit more organization and I'll give it a look-over.
<EspyLacopa> Ohai crazy blue guy.
<Vordox> Wait.. how to formulate this. ><
<hen3ry> Pyst is best Myst.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Pi is a real number because it represents the exact number of times that a circle's diameter can be wrapped around its circumference. Just because the number continues on forever doesn't mean it's "fake" or "inexact". It means technology is incapable of measuring infinite digits. >_>
<Cypresswolf> O_O Myst - Dont know who's streaming atm, but you're now BEST MOD ^_^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02lyncast O.O
<otakon> but how do we know it's infinite?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Then isn't it time to make a new math science for it?
<lyncast> But wy otakon?
<otakon> Cypresswolf: it's Phase4
<lyncast> Hai an
<otakon> lyncast: saxy is on to you
<lyncast> SB64
<CriticKitten> Vordox: I'm becoming increasingly convinced that you're spouting gibberish.
<lyncast> Oh noes
*SuperBrony64 hugs lyncast
<Reikim> Vordox: Math is math. Science is science. They happen to have overlap. All done.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: That sentence makes no sense.
<Vordox> Reikim: Indeed.
<lyncast> <3
<CriticKitten> o.O
*Reikim dusts hands and puts away the convo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know, but it's not easy when you feel like everyone in your family expects you to work when you're not confident that you can and struggling with work anxiety.
<otakon> well that's ominous
<Vordox> That's...pretty damn close to what I meant...more or less Reikim
<Reikim> Now to argue about something more amusing.
<owlicious> bye!
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-brb-hibernating1.jpg
<Yahooz> whaaaaat
<otakon> lyncast: good to see you again take care eh?
<owlicious> otakon: he's gone
<Vordox> CriticKitten: I'm not easily understood, sorry.
<otakon> owlicious: she, that was a girl
<Cypresswolf> Went to Walmart while I was out - havent checked for ponies there in a few weeks - got some individual ponies I didnt have
<Reikim> So uh, how about that cat?
<otakon> Reikim: what cat?
<Phase4> 00,02wonder what these gears do
<Vordox> Reikim: The Dead/Alive one?
<AttackAndalite> Nittany_Discord: Have you tried meditation of some kind to ease the anxiety?
<owlicious> oops. assume the same as 90% by default.
<otakon> owlicious: well it's a long story
<Reikim> Vordox: Mebbe. But if we discuss it we try to keep math out of the issue.
<hen3ry> The cat is dead. While we were arguing about it, it starved to death
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, lyncast == Lyra?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually am on meds, but trying to come off of them because of bad side effects.
<Vordox> hen3ry: How can you say that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Phase4: Yup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Plus, I can't afford them.
<Vordox> hen3ry: If we cannot prove that the cat is alive or dead, we cannot prove if it had food or not. =P
<ChronoClutch> don't know wat game this is :S
<Reikim> Vordox: WHAT. Genius.
<hen3ry> wow.
<otakon> owlicious: but basically troll that was not mean spirited and messed around here, got banned and went to the join the militayr. even gave us a big send off vid before she went. she pops in from time to time. Very odd girl, but nice overall.
<hen3ry> Go apply for your nobel prize now.
<Cypresswolf> Plumsweet, Cherry Pie, & 4 glitter wings - Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Ploomette, & Daisy Dreams
<hen3ry> :D
<AttackAndalite> Nittany_Discord: *giant hugs*
<Vordox> Reikim: Well we cannot open the box. *shrug*'
<owlicious> otakon: oh.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: 'sfine, I just had no clue what you're talking about or how to explain the concepts to you, because I haven't figured out what your misconceptions are yet.
<Bronysith> celestia is in charge of day. luna is in charge of night, cadance is in charge of TWILIGHT
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Aye, I have most of the terms in Swedish...
<Vordox> And some of the more harder ones...Well I don't know the English Terms for them. ><
<Reikim> Vordox: Clearly we must open this box. (this is the part where Science happens)
<hen3ry> No, Cadence used to be in charge of Twilight, but Twily doesn't need a foalsitter anymore.
<Vordox> Reikim: More like trying to get a glimpse but we cannot see still. :P
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs AttackAndalite
<AttackAndalite> Nittany_Discord: Hugs alll over!
<AdamTheDuck> Y U NO WORK BUTTON
<Cypresswolf> I only get a few ponies at a time so I dont have trouble finding new ones, but Im about to run out of current toys at the pace Im going
<Reikim> Vordox: Aye, but this underlines the difference between Science and Philosophy. Philosophy wonders whether or not the cat is alive. Science opens the damn box (with proper precautions of course).
<Vordox> XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> advice from shizuka?
<Vordox> Hahaha
<Vordox> That's a very easy understandble point you made there
<otakon> yay for advice from Shizuka!
<CrimsonPhoenix> if that ain't cheating I don't know what cheatcodes are
<Vordox> I'm a person who would open it. :P personally
<Vordox> Precautions or not.
<CriticKitten> Philosophy is hilarious sometimes.
<Reikim> Vordox: Congrats, you're a scientist.
<owlicious> Vordox: poisonous gas inside the box
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: Shizuka is hax, pure and unadulterated.
<Vordox> owlicious: So? I get an answer before I die. :P
<ChronoClutch> i need new game to play
<owlicious> get a gas mask. That's what may or may not have killed it.
<Vordox> Wait... I'm a scientist.O.o
<ChronoClutch> any recomendations
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, she played the game before
<CrimsonPhoenix> many times
<Vordox> ChronoClutch: Free to Play?
<owlicious> You know you can just buy kitties that are definitely alive
<Reikim> Vordox is now a scientist.
*Shizuka 13has myst memorized...
<ChronoClutch> Vordox doesnt matter
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: u dont say?
<Vordox> ChronoClutch: Iji
<hen3ry> I don't want to be a scientist anymore. I want to be...
<Lightning-Quill> Sometimes the answer is not worth dying for
<hen3ry> a lumberjack!
*Vordox puts on a lab coat. "Where do I begin!"
<Reikim> ChronoClutch: SCP Containment Breach.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> im sorry but what is this game about?
<Cypresswolf> I first played Myst at 11, took me over a year to figure it out for myself - Rocket was the toughest puzzle for me :)
<Vordox> I'll go fuck up science, brb
<owlicious> it depends. If trixies was inside the box...
<CriticKitten> Shizu: And that's the one thing I dislike about puzzle games. The replay factor is....not there. >_>
<Shizuka> 13riven does better
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Play more Tetris
<Reikim> Vordox: But anyway, yeah, I excel at roughly two things: putting complicated terms into plain speech, and putting simple ideas into overly eloquent phrases.
<EspyLacopa> Phase: Close the door first.
<Shizuka> 13at least until you memorize the number system
<EspyLacopa> Then hit the button.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WILL DO
<Vordox> Reikim: Teacher?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I LOVE TETRIS
<panda-drawing> otakon one last thing... blank flank?
<CriticKitten> Unless you're just aiming for the fastes possible run, in which case you can do that I guess. :P
<otakon> Shizuka: you like puzzle games dont' you?
<Phase4> 00,02EspyLacopa, i can close the door?
<Shizuka> 13like i've said before
<Reikim> Vordox: I am the lousiest teacher ever seen. Especially in math.
<otakon> panda-drawing: it's a Pick Axe actually, he's a miner
<Shizuka> 13myst was my childhood
<Vordox> Reikim: Yet you have those two traits, odd.
<Shizuka> 13ohhhh yes door must close first
<Vordox> Shizuka is fangasming atm. :P
<Vordox> ChronoClutch: Check up the Iji trailer
<Shizuka> 13forgot that part, too used to games that automatically close the door when you use an elevator
<otakon> Shizuka: I never liked them too much, unless it was something like MOnkey Island that was funny and had good writing
<panda-drawing> otakon hm... guess the armstrong was a perfect fit then ^-^
<otakon> panda-drawing: yeah :_
<AdamTheDuck> ChronoClutch Well killing floor is half price if you're into survivial shooters
<otakon> :)
<ChronoClutch> im looking :P
<Vordox> Shizuka: Oh you mean "Quick time events"? :P
<Reikim> Vordox: But I prefer the latter, therefore I fail. And on top of that, I have zero patience.
<Vordox> Reikim: ...You should become a teacher
<Shizuka> 13no no like say source engine, you push an elevator button and the door closes for you
*Reikim would make a lousy teacher
<Shizuka> 13forgot myst makes you do it yourself
<Shizuka> 13because we are lazy players
<Vordox> Shizuka: Agreed.. DO YOUR SHIT,:P
<Cypresswolf> only game in Myst series I havent played is 5 - got most of the way through URU before my computer crash in December
<Reikim> Vordox: Besides, the job market for teachers is absolutely atrocious right now.
<EspyLacopa> Make sure you write down that clue, by the by.
<Vordox> Reikim: I know...
<Phase4> 00,022:40 2,2,1
<Shizuka> 135 is.. eh
<Shizuka> 13yay phase~
<Phase4> 00,02and cause the doors open themselves i assume they close themselves
*Nittany_Discord 11,01closes
<Vordox> Reikim: Still...Why cannot I be a philosopher ANd a scientist...Would that cause an impossibility?
<ChronoClutch> meh
<ChronoClutch> I am more on the lines looking for a mmo game :P
<Vordox> ChronoClutch: MLP Online
<ChronoClutch> doesnt have to be competitive
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01AttackAndalite: Don't think bad of my mom, please.
<ChronoClutch> mlp online?!
<Shizuka> 132:40 2,2,1
<Reikim> Vordox: Nah, not really. They don't tend to get along, but that's not saying it's impossible. And both fields have special areas for impossibilities, anyway.
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut mlp online?
<Shizuka> 13what is 2:40 :3
<otakon> TIME MACHINE!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A time.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's Shizuka time!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> OMG A CLOCK
<Reikim> Shizuka: The exact time at which I was born.
<Vordox> Reikim: Beyondtrue. ._. I've seen some convos.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dances with Shizuka.
<hen3ry> When this thing hits 88 mph...
<otakon> OH NO JC, A BOMB!
<AdamTheDuck> back to the future nostalgia moment?
<Cypresswolf> Im grateful to have the experience of Myst before I ever knew what the internet was - couldnt look much of anything up in its early days
<Vordox> Reikim: You want to know something weird about me? :P
<Reikim> Vordox: I wouldn't mind, per se.
<AttackAndalite> Nittany_Discord: I won't, even though she should support your decision. I'm incapable of thinking wrong or hating anyone, period. It's just not in me.
<Unnr> Cypresswolf: Ever play return to zork?
<Vordox> Reikim: My very name is based on confusement
<Vordox> Paradoxial Vortex.
<Cypresswolf> Love that music ^_^
<otakon> Cypresswolf: so, banging your head against the wall to figure out shit for 5 months eh?
<Vordox> ParaDOXial VORtex <--
<Shizuka> 13i know totally spoiling..
<otakon> Shizuka: gonna get Quantum ..whatits?
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Hey, everypony, what are we watching?
<hen3ry> The Internet. The repository of all human information. Especially Disinformation.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She supports me going to voc rehab.
<EspyLacopa> Yea, the astromony thing is for a different age book.
<otakon> Red_Pegasus|Soviet: Real Myst
<Vordox> How everything can be everything but at the same time being a paradox in itself.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> we're watching Half life episode 3
<Shizuka> 13quantum conundrum, already got and finished
<Cypresswolf> otakon: Yep, that's how everypony played games back then :)
<otakon> Shizuka: wow that quick?
<Shizuka> 13phase that was a tree
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Is that a scary game?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She supports me doing anything but nothing.
<otakon> it's a FLUTTERSHY!
<Vordox> In other words, total confusment. :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i now hate otakon
<Tassadork> looks like myst or some sequel
<Reikim> Shizu, you go through these games way too fast o_O
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: well that's good right?
<Marx> Well, something interesting I found: If CollegeHumer's FB page gets 1,000,000 likes, one of their guys will wear a beard of bees.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: but I love Fluttershy!
<Shizuka> 13QC was about five hours
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> then say its a tree >.>
<EspyLacopa> BIRDS
<Shizuka> 13victory for phase~
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some of my anxiety may be me, but it's easier said than done to overcome.
<Vordox> Reikim: As you see.... That name has alot of meaning to me. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bad experience on my last job hurts a lot.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also ADHD.
<EspyLacopa> Ahhh, fun puzzle time.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the move.
<ChronoClutch> cant wait for mlp fighting is magic to come out
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dude, all you can do is just pull yourself up by the bootstrapsn and keep going man.
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: We have faith in you.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what was your last job Nittany?
<Vordox> ADHD can be something good.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Painting apartments.
<ChronoClutch> I am a pro at fighting game like SS4 MVC3 MK
<Vordox> ADHD alot of people had ADHD cases, where they were able to put it to good use
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you can do it :)
<ChronoClutch> so I will be a natural at mlp fim :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And when they started making me work overtime and weekends, I had a panic attack due to hating the thought of doing that.
<Reikim> Vordox: And if I remember correctly, ADHD is often accompanied by increased capacities in other areas.
<Vordox> Reikim: If handled, yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I can't shake anxiety on the job now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'm easily overwhelmed by large amounts of work.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: wait why? it's work, you need to work man
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: ah
<EspyLacopa> Awww, he had it right.
<EspyLacopa> And then he brokeded it.
<Unnr> Otakon, because overtime and weekend work is draining
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: dude, the only thing you can do is what you can that's all there is to it.
<Unnr> beyond all sanity
<Vordox> otakon: How old are you?
<Reikim> What, we're asking about ages now?
<otakon> Unnr: I've been there, a MONTH of getting about 2 hours of sleep a night and working damn near 18 hours a day with a 3 hour commute back and forth.
<otakon> Vordox: 27 going on 28 this month.
<Reikim> otakon: Happy Birthday!
<Unnr> Ah, that schedule, how I know ye well.
<Vordox> Reikim: Understanding the drain of the psyche in a work you love causing it to become less and less of interest over due time is something most people do not experience...
<Shizuka> 13there it is :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The next interview, I became overwhelmed because the guy was pointing out all of these things I might have to do. Blew the interview. I didn't even get the job, and I was getting anxiety.
<Vordox> But once they do, it's devestating
<Cypresswolf> otakon: what frustrated me most about this game - wont give too much away - involved mazing along a track
<Shamroc> ohai shizu!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And that was washing dishes.
<Shizuka> 13time for mechanical age~
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Any news from your brother about his opportunity?
<Reikim> Vordox: Ah, I see. I'm glad that I've managed to avoid that thus far.
<Vordox> Reikim: Dang meant this to Otakon =P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vordox: Not really. He's being worked hard and hasn't had a chance to talk to his manager.
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Tv book?
<otakon> I was working at Dunkin' Donuts morning shift, had to leave my house 4 am every day and then I had to go to work as a Deli slicer but didn't have enough time to go home and catch nap or shower or nothing bc no car. Then i worked to 11 pm at night average and sometimes I didn't get home until the next morning bc the buses and trains stopped running and it was too far to walk and I had no ride.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He was working all weekend.
<otakon> sorry for the wall.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany what does he do?
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-meaning-of-life.png
<Shizuka> 13this will be good
<EspyLacopa> So, did Phase read and take notes from those books in the main island library?
<Shizuka> 13mechanical doesn't really have any
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: I don't know if I could do that.
<Shizuka> 13dat useless throne~
<Bronysith> Shizuka: which version of myst should i get?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It /sounds/ easy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But if I try to do that, anxiety.
<Reikim> otakon: I would kill myself before succumbing to a schedule like that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's fucking frustrating.
<Shizuka> 13get realmyst
<Vordox> otakon: Was working...?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I did it for a month, but it was goddamn tiring me out. Couldn't do it anymore, had to take one job over the other.
<otakon> Vordox: this was several years ago
<Bronysith> ty Shizu
<Vordox> otakon: Ah
<otakon> seriously, you CANNOT live on a few hours of sleep a day
<otakon> for a month
<Cypresswolf> I wish I had the soundtrack to this game - Riven if I remember right, came with a little brochure with actually replica merchandise from costumes to weapons seen in game
<otakon> neat
<Vordox> otakon: I sleep like...what..3 hours a night? =P
<otakon> Vordox: yeah, but not from NOT being home to do it
<Vordox> School from 7AM to 7 PM, BrS from 9 PM to 3 AM, Sleep till 6 AM.
<otakon> Vordox: I had to walk 3 miles a day any weather to get to these jobs.
<Cypresswolf> Games later than Riven didnt offer any merch - I think I still have that brochure
<Vordox> otakon: And how did you feel abotu the jobs?
<otakon> And that was included in the 3 hour each way commute
*Ponies47 Hates school -_-
<Vordox> Ponies47: School is EASY :P
*ChronoClutch finished school
<Reikim> Ponies47: Aw, don't be like that!
<EspyLacopa> Page, Get!
<Shizuka> 13only problem with realmyst is it's hard to find the interesting bits, since there aren't nodes to tell you "i can stand here therefore something useful"
<otakon> Vordox: they were jobs, they were paying the bills. One cut my hours too much though, so I had to switch jobs.
<Ponies47> School is booooooooooring!
<xxMoopyxx> i know right
<otakon> I started as a Deli Slicer and it was going well, plenty of hours.
<Vordox> Ponies47: Make it fun then
<Reikim> Ponies47: Then you're not doing it right.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Ponies47: But it will be usefull when you grow up >.<
<otakon> then suddenly went from full time to 15 hours A WEEK
<ChronoClutch> honestly school is the best time of a persons life you get to be in an environement filled wiht friends
<ChronoClutch> and get to mess around and have a good time with a little bit of homework
<Ponies47> Plus. I start high school this year -
<Ponies47> -__
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka must had googled a bunch of stuff when she played Myst
<otakon> so I HAD to find another job or a second one to afford my bills
<Vordox> How I made fun in my school, Friends, Got a club for gaming starting(We even had Tournaments in the Amphietheater of the High School!)
<xxMoopyxx> yeah but school gets alot of trouble and dramma
<Shizuka> 13nah
<otakon> yeah
<Cypresswolf> :| They're not in the box anymore
<Shizuka> 13google didn't exist
*Ponies47 Had pretty much no friends at all in middle school
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Ponies47: I mean when your like 20.
<ChronoClutch> Vordox like a boss
<Vordox> otakon: Ah...work cut
<Reikim> Ponies47: You will either love or hate high school. The trick is realizing that the difference between the two is largely based on your own choices.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: o_o sounds scary
<hen3ry> same here. Middle School was... beh
<Vordox> ChronoClutch: We turned the boring sitting in the library when free and having a chat, to just BLOW it out and do some fun instead.
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Dat kerbal desktop
<CrazyHippie> hi everypony
<Ponies47> I hate schoolmand I always have. The End -_-
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Crazyhippie
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Haii CrazyHippie!
<Ponies47> *school and
<CrazyHippie> hi
<Ponies47> Hey CrazyHippie
<Vordox> YOU CONTROL YOUR LIFE; DO IT TO WHAT YOU WANT
<Cypresswolf> If I had the money at age 11, I would have bought every item in that thing
<Reikim> Ponies47: Then you will continue to do it wrong and you will continue to be miserable and that's terrible.
<Vordox> Reikim: That's school...
<CrazyHippie> what are we watching?
<CriticKitten> Lollipop Chainsaw is strangely amusing to watch, and not just because it sounds like Twilight Sparkle snapped one day and started taking a chainsaw to everyone.
<LightningDashFast> hey everypony
<ChronoClutch> Vordox my school did the same thing except they would only play halo 3 and ssbb, I love both games but I was way out of tjeir league skill wise so I stopped going
<Vordox> Reikim: The quicker people learn that they can DO alot of fun, in their words, it becomes way better.
<CrazyHippie> hi
<otakon> Vordox: yeah, sucked man. I did it for a month, I eventually told the my boss at the deli "I WILL be off on SUNDAY, I cannot make it to work and I need sleep" and after that I gave him my two weeks and switched to Dunkin' DOnuts full time. I liked DD, it was interesting and was there 3 years.
<ChronoClutch> this pony needs a challenge
<Vordox> ChronoClutch: Awww.
<CrazyHippie> What are we watching?
<Reikim> Vordox: Life is my bitch. If it starts getting uppity I smack it around a bit until it settles down.
<Ponies47> Reikim: I hated middle school and pretty much had no friends at all -_-
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Press random red buttons, it'll help
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've love to stay in academia to teach.
<Vordox> Reikim: XD
<ChronoClutch> Reikim oh god thats wat she said
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: You have a teaching permit?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might inquire about getting a teaching certificate.
<ChronoClutch> ya teaching is fun
<Reikim> Ponies47: That's not high school. Go. Search. Make friends.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: It MAY be low paid work...
<ChronoClutch> especially if u teach comm tech or tv/video
<Vordox> But it'll be interesting
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> High school is cool when you know a lot of ppl there
<LightningDashFast> wat
<Unnr> Though if you stay at university level, weird things happen when it comes to getting jobs
<ChronoClutch> easiest marking ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not community college I think.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Oh specialized teaching?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish I could go into a university.
<Shizuka> 13now i have confused phase :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hard work, but high pay.
<LightningDashFast> teh bombs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And research!!!!
<Unnr> Community College is a good extra chunk of change
<Reikim> Ponies47: Besides, I've gone through most of my life with only a circle of maybe five good friends, less than that at times. You don't need much more.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Yeah Research during free time :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's what I want to do.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm going to do that.
<ChronoClutch> Nittany_Twilight is that you???
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: If you want to do it, DO IT.
<thegt90> im back from my horrible week from home to go to my ants wedding
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Sure it'll be hell at first... >.>
<Ponies47> Reikim: School doesn't start until the end of August. Plus I hate the fact since I'm a freshman I have to go in 1 day earlier before everybody else does -_-
<CrazyHippie> AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tomorrow, I'm going to teach myself Java and continue some research from my master's thesis.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's stuff that'll be published.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase loves pressing that button
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: ..wait...Java ._.
<thegt90> V
<thegt90> http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html
<Cypresswolf> I'm certain when I move out from upstairs later this year, Ill find that Riven replica brochure - I know I have it somewhere!
<Reikim> Ponies47: Repeat: Go. Search. Find the friends that are there but haven't been discovered yet.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes, Java.
<Vordox> DEAR GOD, WHY JAVA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not that hard.
<Reikim> Ponies47: Find whatever you love doing and do it. You'll meet people.
<Vordox> I tried to learn it...for 3 fricking years!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So I can put it on my resume that I know it.
<Vordox> (This was back in Early 2000s)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I taught myself Perl in a few weeks or so.
<Vordox> I still can't do Java today =P
<Reikim> Vordox: See, this was your problem.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> once you get to know java, the other stuff you learn is easy to do
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can do simple sorting in Perl.
<LightningDashFast> dat music
<Unnr> Java is easy to pick up quickly, particulalry with all it standard libs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I learned Matlab over time with help.
<Vordox> I can do partial C++, Flash AS3, GML, URCS.
<Reikim> Ponies47: Also, try some of the arts. In my experience, bronies tend to congregate in the arts.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Coding comes pretty easy to me.
<Ponies47> Reikim: I suck at art but yet I signed up for it. I'm not doing anything like sports. -_-
<xxMoopyxx> why is that game keep poping you out like that?
<Vordox> xxMoopyxx: Chatting :P
<Reikim> Ponies47: Art is good. Try one. Music, visual, drama even.
<xxMoopyxx> oh
<Unnr> Ponies47: You might want to try to form an intermural team if your HS offers it.
<Reikim> Ponies47: Visual art tends to attract the most bronies, on average.
<ChronoClutch> ugh i need something productive to do
<Unnr> Your team can suck, but you can play to have a good time
<ChronoClutch> Q_Q
*Reikim knows VB and...yeah, that's about it.
<Unnr> and you will meet a bunch of other people
<Vordox> My art = FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE AND TOLERANCE AND games...yes games.
<otakon> ah games
<Cypresswolf> What I do remember is a company called Museum Replicas made Gehn's Gun, Moiety Knives, Moiety Hunting Sickle, Atrus & Catherine's robes - all I remember
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Gaaaames.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish I could draw. I would do commissions.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Make some money.
<otakon> same here
<Cypresswolf> They were only in limited supply
<Ponies47> Reikim: No I signed up for art art. We're you paint (squee) like that. -_-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No-one wants tutoring.
<otakon> I used to able to scribble a bit
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Ahahahaha you're not serious are you.
<otakon> but not anymore
<Reikim> Ponies47: So visual art. Good.
<LightningDashFast> needs moar games with ponies
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Reikim: Why?
<ChronoClutch> i wish i had something to dodododo
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Doing commissions for money. Pffft.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why?
<Vordox> Reikim: Heard of Freelancers who makes millions?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's better than my current options.
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Art and making money don't generally find themselves in the same sentence.
<Unnr> Nittany_Discord: The money in tutoring is SAT and highschool/ private grade/middleschool turoring
<otakon> argh I am not PLAYING TF2 WHY DO YOU NEED TO VALIDATE THE FILES FOR IT?
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Slave over a canvas for eighteen hours to make maybe forty bucks.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't mean making a living.
<Ponies47> Reikim: Yeah. But I suck at art. Plus it's only fresh man year. I'm not telling anybody I'm a brony until I'm settled down, have friends, ect -_-
<otakon> just stuff on the sie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it's money.
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/VpAOF
<Unnr> Yes, but tutoring 8th grade I was able to pull down 20$ an hour
<Reikim> Vordox: About as easy to find as my soul.
<ChronoClutch> I am too much of an idealist :(
<Unnr> for doing algebra
<Shizuka> 13the mechanical age
<otakon> you'd be surprised what people would pay for for a half descent drawing.
<Shizuka> 13full of red herrings
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm looking into tutoring.
<Reikim> Unnr: ...My god that's good.
<Vordox> Reikim: http://www.artnet.de/Images/magazine/features/ortland/ortland09-26-06-2.jpg <--- Guess how much this is worth?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: cut the tree with the herring
<Shizuka> 13no no that's channelwood silly
<owlicious> a couple million
<owlicious> but it's a professional
<Vordox> Correct owlicious
<Vordox> How?
<Vordox> HOW IS THIS PROFFESIONAL?
<Reikim> Vordox: I've taken formal art training, I'm aware of the successes. I'm also aware of the success/failure ratio on "pure" artists.
<otakon> THE HELL
<owlicious> a professional did it. Style and appearance? I don't get modern art.
<Vordox> Reikim: Indeed... I know
<otakon> it's just a RED CANAS
<owlicious> otakon: it's partly blue
<Unnr> SAT tutoring can double, but you have to be good and advertise a minimum score
<otakon> argh just argh
<Tassadork> otakon: no... it's a blue bit, a red bit, and a tiny gold bit on the end
<ChronoClutch> its not just A red canvas
<Unnr> and / or improvement over a prior score
<ChronoClutch> it is THE Red Canvas
<otakon> Tassadork: THAT is not the point
<ChronoClutch> get it right
<owlicious> otakon: oh look, a bit of yellow!
<ChronoClutch> :P
<otakon> the point is..I COULD DO THAT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I applied to a job teaching MCAT training classes, but I didn't pass the entrance exam.
<LightningDashFast> :D
<owlicious> all hand painted
<Reikim> otakon: I'd explain that except that would mean dredging up several records on non-objective art and I wouldn't believe half of it anyway.
<owlicious> but you didn't
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it was a physics test.
<DashieMusic2> hello everypony, what game is this?
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Realmyst
<otakon> Shit, I'll paint that tomorrow
<Sumica> 00,10winde it till it's head pops off
<Bronysith> DashieMusic2: myst
<otakon> hiya DashieMusic2 this is Real Myst
<xxMoopyxx> hey go back sit in the throne go hail to the king baby
<Vordox> Reikim: Should we draw in the Art Paradox into this discussion? :P
<Reikim> Okay I'm LAYING DOWN SOME RULES HERE when it comes to the term "modern art".
<Reikim> The flat red canvases and such? That was modern art...twenty years ago or so.
<Cypresswolf> the motion in this version is much smoother - my versions were point and click - the only animations were the elavators
<Unnr> but if you are good at doing SAT Tutoring you can easily charge 100$ and hour
<Reikim> It has its own name now, which I can't remember for the life of me.
<Vordox> "Are you afraid of red"
<Unnr> from what I remember a friend in the states was able to do
<Cypresswolf> and the gear road for the clock on Myst island
<Reikim> Modern art nowadays is a lot flashier and is heavily influenced by culture. Global warming is an incredibly current theme.
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: realmyst does that :3
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Vordox: Red?
<Vordox> Red_Pegasus|Soviet: yES
<Shizuka> 13hmmm when will phase pull out the notebook :3
<Cypresswolf> :) Oh how many times did I run around in cirlces in this game....
<Vordox> Reikim: I still look 30+ to Infinite years before Modern art, and I am proud, I turn my head to today and just sigh
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> This game is just a learning game for Steven Hawkings.
<Reikim> Vordox: Have you actually seen any of today's art? Not an accusation, just asking.
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Sadly ,he cannot use the mouse.
<Vordox> Reikim: I dropped Modern art out of my area of interest way over 15 years ago
<Cypresswolf> I hope everypony was paying attention - you should have memorized those symbols :P
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Triangle?
<Unnr> But Modern art refers to the period between 1850 and 1970
<Unnr> we are in the crazy world of postmodernism
<panda-drawing> otakon uh... you have skype right?
<Reikim> Vordox: Modern art has actually expanded. What the term is used to refer to is its own era, and I'll be damned if I can remember it now but it only lasted through the nineties. The current art world is a lot more varied.
<otakon> panda-drawing: yeah i do, it's otakon1984
<Vordox> Really?
<otakon> panda-drawing: why?
<Cypresswolf> Another thing, Myst always had the same puzzle solutions - Riven was different every time - then Myst 3: Exile followed the same formula as Myst
<owlicious> If i put water in a cardboard box, is that art?
<Vordox> Like a women putting paint on her bossom and push herself against a canvas...
<Vordox> And selling millions?
<Reikim> Vordox: Yeah. A lot of it is hippies complaining about the environment.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I forget who asked permission to draw my OC yesterday. I'd like to see what he's drawing.
<panda-drawing> otakon im on mobile, you have to add me ^-^ so i can send you the drawing silly ^-^
<Reikim> Vordox: Not that, that was a weird one.
<otakon> panda-drawing: ah
<Vordox> Reikim: That sold...
<Unnr> Massurealism, for example
<Cypresswolf> Riven drove me crazy
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Wasn't me. =/
<panda-drawing> otakon its "theagilepanda"
<Vordox> LOOK
<Unnr> or altermodernism
<Vordox> ART
<Vordox> THERE
<Reikim> Vordox: There are actually serious painters still! And sculptors. Lot of sculptors who work in prefabs. And performance art.
<Vordox> ON THE WALLS
*Nittany_Discord 11,01draws panda-drawing
<Vordox> Damnit, who wrote the last ping, I got kicked. :P
<ChronoClutch> :( I am dieing here from boredom wat to doooo Q_Q
<Vordox> GOD DAMN YOU WREK
<Reikim> Vordox: That would be me.
<Meanwhile> Wombo Tri Combo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ow.
<panda-drawing> Nittany_Discord drawception xD
<Unnr> I think the technical term for the modern movement is Metamodernism
<otakon> and done oh agile one
<pony_7007> whats on the stream
<Yahooz> Dat aint Vordox
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: You have an OC? May we see?
<panda-drawing> ^-^ thank you otakon
<Unnr> which itsself is a reaction to post-post modernism
<otakon> pony_7007: it's Real Myst
<otakon> panda-drawing: np
<Vordox> Okay, who pinged me last before I got kicked, I couldn't read, Was it you Reikim ? Or Unnr ?
<Reikim> Unnr: I thought it was postmodernism still.
<pony_7007> otakon: thanks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have two OCs.
<Reikim> Vordox: Me.
<Unnr> nope
<Vordox> Reikim: What did you wrote?
<Unnr> it was post-postmodern for a while
<Vordox> write*
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Nittany_Discord: Is one a maid?
<panda-drawing> Nittany_Discord may i have the links again? ^-^
<Reikim> Vordox: Something about serious painters still existing. And prefab scultors.
<Unnr> but its slowly morphed to metamoderism
<Cypresswolf> I loved reading the books in this series - the ones in game - though the Myst Reader is my favorite series next to Redwall
<Vordox> Reikim: The thing is, I see art where effort was put into the canvas.
<Vordox> REAL TO GOD DAMN EFFORT
<panda-drawing> Nittany_Discord pm though :/ pwease???
<Reikim> Vordox: What's the canvas, though?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK
<Reikim> Vordox: :)
<Vordox> Everytime I see some "easy done paint" i just get angry
<ChronoClutch> oh god the disscussion on art is still going
<Vordox> Reikim: That canbe anything
<ChronoClutch> me = cliff jump
<Vordox> Anywhere where the art(Drawing Art now) can be done is the canvas.
<Wormwood> Reikim, in regards to your previous comment about "slaving away" on a canvas for 18 hours to make $40: professional artists can usually draw commissions in a relatively small amount of time and make a decent amount of money. The industry standard is actually quite high. Obviously an artist has to be quite skilled and well known but the point still stands that one can be quite successful while doing commissions.
<Unnr> ChronoClutch: Its just a postmodernist reaction to the earlier science and maths discussion
<Unnr> >_>
<Reikim> Vordox: Right then. Anyway, that was modernism, now (as Unnr has explained) we have gone through two more movements and ended at metamodernism. Which is a lot of complaining about society.
<Lightning-Quill> 1st season of MLP in 1080p done now for season 2
<Reikim> Vordox: Correction: Art has almost always been complaining about society. Sorry about that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My draq OC may be a maid canon.
<Vordox> Reikim: Hehe
<ChronoClutch> I have already watched all the mlp episodes like 3 times I need more Q_Q
<Vordox> Reikim: http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=145621 <-- Might be something of interest to you
<Sumica> 00,10did I just see Vordox get kicked 3 times in a row?
<Vordox> ChronoClutch: Go Tyoutubing
<Vordox> Yes Sumica...
<Vordox> You too Unnr, that link
<ChronoClutch> i mean like more new episodes
<ChronoClutch> to come out
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Are their people in this game?
<LightningDashFast> wat
<Reikim> Vordox: My Immortal. First thing on there. I laughed SO HARD.
<Unnr> The thing is that with the advent of photography, art was free to break free from the constraints of the real
<Sumica> 00,10this network is screwy at times
<Unnr> and was allowed much, much more freedom
<Unnr> That being said, there is some art that is just lazy.
<Vordox> :P Reikim
*Unnr points to piss christ
<Vordox> Unnr: As I said, when I see effort, I like it, when I see no effort I hate it
<Vordox> I can FEEL art.
<Vordox> In a weird sense. :P
<Reikim> Vordox: So I guess you're like me and hate the majority of pop music then.
<Vordox> Reikim: ...urgh...
<Vordox> Reikim: 4 Chord songs has a hit or miss, depending on how it's done
<Reikim> Thank God, finally someone who relates.
<Vordox> Reikim: Good enough answer?
<Vordox> What you mean Thank god? ASK EVERYONE here.
<Lightning-Quill> This game angers me greatly
<Reikim> I just can't stand a lot of things about today's pop music scene.
<adasdad> what we watchin'?
<Reikim> Starting with lyrics, working up into the gradual assimilation of dubstep
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Realmyst
<Vordox> Reikim: Pop Music, Hip Hop, "Bitchy" rap.
<LightningDashFast> realmyst
<Ponies47> BRB
<Reikim> Vordox: Screw it all. This is why I stopped using a radio long ago.
<Meanwhile> Right, attention now being paid to stream, what's going on?

<AdamTheDuck> Reikim: words of wisdom.

<Vordox> Meanwhile: And gears, elevators...
<Meanwhile> otakon: That's the one Shizu is constantly plugging right?
<otakon> eeyup
<Shizuka> 13i would constantly plug riven
<otakon> well I think so
<Shizuka> 13but even less ponies here would get it..
<Meanwhile> Art and math. Wild conversation I'm sure.
<Reikim> It suddenly occurs to me that I haven't drawn anything in forever.
<LightningDashFast> BORIING:O
<Shizuka> 13need more vivi x me art
<Unnr> More science types should learn about art, and vice versa

<Shizuka> 13robyn miller ladies and gentlemen
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Can't tell if suppost to be like that, or lip syncing is bad
<Vordox> Reikim: Impressionism is probably the most weird category in art
<Reikim> Vordox: Lies, non-objective and abstractionism.
<Vordox> Reikim: It has such a varying opportunistic ways =/

<Vordox> Dadaism?
<Meanwhile> Phase4: I was expecting a poem there.
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Reikim> Vordox: I shit you not that was an art movement.
<Vordox> Reikim: ...What the fuck is Dadaism?
<owlicious> it's aiming for absurdity, Vordox
<Vordox> Oh
<owlicious> i forget what else.
<LightningDashFast> those are stars eight?
<Vordox> That's fine, I like those. :P
<Vordox> It's like Bizzaro

<owlicious> BOOM
<Meanwhile> Keeeku
<Vordox> .......................................... I am trying to have a CONVERSATION here
<owlicious> Bustah keeku
<Reikim> Vordox: Intentionally nonsensical art. I think it took place around WWII, and was in part a form of protest against the war. You think modern art was weird? Dadaism laughs in the face of modern art.
<Cypresswolf> :O I just remember I have Myst on DS - *runs to retrieve it* ^_^ Sleep is over rated!
<Meanwhile> Auto kick has nothing but scorn for your desire to talk to people.
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> How long is this game?
<Reikim> Vordox: I think Picasso may have shown up right at the tail end of it.
<Vordox> Red_Pegasus|Soviet: Got any examples?
<Mesh> Cypress I heard the DS port was like so tiny you couldn't see anything.
<Vordox> Reikim: Got any examples?
<Shizuka> 13depends how long it takes you to work out puzzles
<Vordox> Sorry Red_Pegasus|Soviet . Miseplled the tab
<Shizuka> 13you can speedrun it in like two minutes
<Shizuka> 13but that's because the last puzzle is a shortcut around most of the game if you know it from the start
<Reikim> Hm
<Cypresswolf> yeah, it is - but its Myst
<Reikim> yup
<Reikim> Vordox: Flash crashed, shoot. So how do you like dadaism for strange?
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Did you know it?

<Eztio--> What game is this?!
<Sumica> 00,10Myst
<Shizuka> 13this is Phase4 playing realMyst

<Lightning-Quill> I think this game si also available for ipad
<Eztio--> Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10no, Phase4
<Eztio--> Oh
<Reikim> Vordox: The world doesn't deserve art! We shall give it...anti-art!
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Lightning-QUill: I think thats 100 floors
<Vordox> Reikim: You mean New Age modern art or what Unnr called it?
<VioletGreySha> Mornin bronystate :3
<Reikim> Vordox: No, that was Dadaism. Also, Surrealism (which followed) is just as strange but with more point.
*Stallion_of_War dat dari bot
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> Phase4: How much games do you have?
<Vordox> Reikim: I would call the New modern art...anti art if anything
<Phase4> 00,02Red_Pegasus|Soviet, too many
<Stallion_of_War> Sho be do! - http://i46.tinypic.com/28lq4vt.png
<Vordox> Reikim: Absurdity of Dadaism has a point of being not anti art in itself.
<Lightning-Quill> Nope it is right here in the app market for ipad. I'm staring at it
<Sumica> 00,10back to the rust moble again I see
<Stallion_of_War> It's bacon and Applejack!
<Reikim> Vordox: Then look at surrealism and be terrified.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Phase is buying more games?
<Vordox> Reikim: Surrealism, eh.. Hmm

<Unnr> hai Ish!
<Stallion_of_War> Ponies in socks > ponies in tights
<Stallion_of_War> All these message sounds remind me of my ex... :(
<LightningDashFast> ponies in sweaters especially Twily
<Reikim> Vordox: And then there's postmodernism http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism which came after modern but before the art you hate and which is why calling the art you hate modern art is inaccurate.
<Vordox> Reikim: I like surrealism...

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Rave|Happy.
<IshBestPony> Rave|Happy presumably a mod
<Stallion_of_War> I still have scars inside my mouth from the crappy braces I had...
<Stallion_of_War> stupid wires

<Shizuka> 13nah, it'll pass
<Ponies47> *Hey

<Vordox> Reikim: Even thought sbehind ideas can be something of a, imo, way of the art.
<Rave|Happy> Ponies47: Got a rare mount on WoW! :$
<Shizuka> 13previous two wisdom teeth did it too for the first week ish
<Ponies47> Rave|Happy: Cool :3
<Shizuka> 13they get smoothed down with use and my cheek learns to get out of the way
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never had my wisdom teeth removed. Never bothered me.
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> This would be a fun rollercoaster
<Rave|Happy> Ah, time to calm down....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In fact, one never formed.
*Rave|Happy takes a deep breath
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, I haven't had any removed either
<Shizuka> 13yeah all four of mine have been coming in perfect
<LightningDashFast> did u guys see the crush! Kill! Destroy! Swag! chant at bronycon?
<Lunar_Brony> Are we talking about wisdom teeth now?
<Lightning-Quill> I have scars in my lip too. One from getting hit by a car at 4 years old. And a dog almost ripped my bottom lip off
<Red_Pegasus|Soviet> I had to get metal teeth
<FuglyMuffin> Everypony coping with the end of the internet?
<Stallion_of_War> Mine are all slanted, but don't cause trouble
<IshBestPony> College starts in 10 hours
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mom wanted me to have the removed. I was like "Why? They're not bothering me."

*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Stallion_of_War
<Sylandest> Shizuka: I had mine removed several years ago. They knocked me out for 2 days as a result :D
<Stallion_of_War> It's been awhile since I dusted you! You must be diryt!
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: wasn't that a brothel in morrowind?
<Dalekkahn> anybody here enjoy the submachine games?
<Reikim> Shizuka: If it was then it was an art reference and I am happy.
<Reikim> Vordox: http://www.computus.org/journal/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/the-garden-of-earthly-delights.jpg

<Vordox> CAREFUL WITH WHAT OY ULINK
*Stallion_of_War tilt
<Reikim> Vordox: It's just a painting?
<IshBestPony> Hotdiggetydemon said on his Tumblr that he's releasing SWAG.MOV at the end of the year, you know what else is suppossed to happen at the end of the year (hint: it's the end of more than just the year)
<Vordox> Reikim: It's still abit of nudity to it. :P
<Shizuka> 13Phase4 is playing realMyst
<Reikim> Vordox: Ah, I'm sure the mods won't mind. Much. I mean, it's all artistic really.
<Sumica> 00,10this reminds me of that time I comuted to black mesa
<Vordox> Reikim: Also...where the fuck did he come up with all these ideas and poses...
<LightningDashFast> its the end of teh world
<Lightning-Quill> I checked RealMyst is available for ipad
<Stallion_of_War> Ohh that commuter train took FOREVER!
<Shizuka> 13thank you for using the selenitic age transit system
<Reikim> Vordox: Eh, Bosch was...not all there, to put it gently.
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, Ah, that's the game your raving on about?
<Shizuka> 13i rave for all the mysts
<Shizuka> 13except 3 and 5..
<IshBestPony> LightningDashFast I always knew the MOV series would have a hand in it somehow
<Shizuka> 13and 4 is stupid hard
<Stallion_of_War> I rode a TARDIS train once, it took me 20 years to get off... of course GMAN was driving but still...
<LightningDashFast> eeyup
<Vordox> Reikim: No..
<Sumica> 00,10that reminds me it's been almost a year i should check on mind of freman see if it has a new ep again.
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> You went in Statis?
<Vordox> I think I can see some of the things he wishes to put through
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: up to 42 now i think
<Sumica> 00,10oh so 2 new eps
<Phase4> 00,02two more
<Shizuka> 13think so
<Lightning-Quill> ha 42
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> why does no one watch Arby n the chief? :(
*Lunar_Brony is confuzzled
<Phase4> 00,02THIS
<Mesh> Shizuka: I like 5. 4 apparently gets dumb at the end
<IshBestPony> whatcha playin?
<Reikim> Vordox: Yeah. He's kind of like that. By the way, that painting? The centre is supposed to be Heaven.
<Cypresswolf> I enjoyed 3 - gave more insight on why Sirrus & Achenar's history
<Phase4> 00,02is the kind of game that would benefit from todays tech and knowladfe
<Mesh> And turns into a Peter Gabril music video while you play Bejeweled.
<Lunar_Brony> IshBestPony RealMyst
<Phase4> 00,02spell fail
<Reikim> Vordox: Left is the Garden of Eden.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: ikr
<Mesh> Exile is really easy for most of it which is sort of :(
<Reikim> Vordox: Right is Hell.
<Cypresswolf> Although Saveedro's story was a sad one
<Phase4> 00,02if you were to put the same people on a game like this today
<Vordox> Reikim: Yeah, I figured that out
<Mesh> I really like Uru except for like
<Shizuka> 13Mesh: yeah the last pussle in revelation is just stupid...
<Phase4> 00,02it would be that much better
<Mesh> that stupid firefly puzzle
<Shizuka> 13puzzle is spelled with Zs..
<IshBestPony> Lunar_Brony which is in the video game genre of...
<Phase4> 00,02s/z/s/
<Shizuka> 13ah ja eder gire/kemo
<Sumica> 00,10so this is just first myst with better framerate
<Shizuka> 13that one's easier on uru live
<Stallion_of_War> Z's???
<Shizuka> 13since you can get friends to gather the fireflies for you
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yes
*Stallion_of_War zzzzzzzzzz
<Vordox> Reikim: I like the ear motif of pain. :D
<Lunar_Brony> IshBestPony Puzzle? IDK, ask a mod
<Mesh> Sumica: RealMyst? RealMyst is Myst 1 in like, real time, with not static rendered stuff
<Phase4> 00,02i'm gona miss the ability to walk around in riven
<Mesh> Uru got creepy as hell.
<Cypresswolf> Is Releeshan world shown in 5?
<Reikim> Vordox: The theory is that he suffered from tinnitus, much like Van Gogh.
<Mesh> Phase: Dude Riven's puzzles are so
<Mesh> amazing
<Vordox> Oh...
<Shizuka> 13at the end of 5 yes if you do the right ending
<Vordox> So I was right
<Vordox> O.o
<Mesh> the way they all come together
<Shizuka> 13yay the mysties are coming out of the woodwork :3
<Mesh> RealRiven would be amazing
*IshBestPony nomz subway
<Shizuka> 13i have always been disappointed how little crossover there is between bronies und mysties
<Stallion_of_War> I feel the need to draw The Doctor-Derpy saying "Allons-y"
<Phase4> 00,02Mesh, so i've been told, but static images is going to feel a little less real than realmyst
<OrpheusAntony__> Okay, so me and a couple of friends are trying to do a podcast for youtube, and our first episode is about the Mane 6. We really want to make it a podcast that integrates our viewers more than just reading messages, and one of our "segments", if you will, is Questioneighre (Working titles). We call one of our contacts on our phone and ask them easy questions about the show to see if they're smart enough to guess r
<Mesh> Riven's static images look REALLY good though
<Lightning-Quill> So much purple
<Shizuka> 13hold that thought phase
<Phase4> 00,02its not a dealbreaker
<Mesh> Also they're not static. A lot of them have animation
<Stallion_of_War> With the doctor and the Timepony metacrisis doctor
<Phase4> 00,02Mesh, that will help a lot
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: :) Did you ever do the slide in Riven?
<Vordox> OrpheusAntony__: Erm...Are you new to Bronystate?
<LightningDashFast> allons-y indeed
<Shizuka> 13http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs08/39
<Reikim> Vordox: On a similar note, have you heard of Salvador Dali?
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> OrpheusAntony: I'm sorry, I can't go to it right now.
<Sumica> 00,10one of theese days i will show the charicter creater on Tera just for chat reactions.
<Vordox> Reikim: Rings a bell
<Shizuka> 13the slide..
<OrpheusAntony__> k
<Lightning-Quill> I'm renaming my self.
<Shizuka> 13i have memorized riven as well but i do not remember a slide..
<Phase4> 00,02dems the huts you made in mc
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Wormwood> Reikim, you said you were classically trained; where did you study, if you don't mind me asking?
<Reikim> Vordox: Lemme find this one painting for you
<Shamroc> oh Shizuka its da huts!
<IshBestPony> has anypony seen the disturbingly hilarious Barbie shorts, Life in the Dreamhouse?
<Shizuka> 13http://tkj.vortalcord.net/scrapbook/lvs07
<OrpheusAntony__> i'm new here
<Cypresswolf> Yes, Shizuka there's a slide in Riven - Let me make sure I get the island's name right...
<Vordox> OrpheusAntony__: I don't recall your name before, and advertising is kinda illegal here without a base of not being in the proxmity often enough. :P
<OrpheusAntony__> yeah
<OrpheusAntony__> i'm not advertising
<Shizuka> 13oh oh you mean the cart ride to crater island
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Reikim> Wormwood: Erm? I never said I was classically trained, although I am trained to a certain extent. Really, it's just enough to have a general feel for art and some general painting skills.
<Phase4> 00,02two more
<Shizuka> 13where you get dumped into a dead wood chipper :3
<OrpheusAntony__> i'm really just trying to get some questions to ask
<Vordox> OrpheusAntony__: Oh
<IshBestPony> OrpheusAntony welcome to bronystate, come and stay, unless you are a regular here disguised as a n00b in which case REVEAL YOURSELF!!!
<Wormwood> Reikim: Ah, okay.
<Vordox> OrpheusAntony__: Well, go on, I kinda like the idea you are going for her. Might be some simple fun in that. :)
<Shizuka> 13jaja phase, stoneship and channelwood, do stoneship first the marker switch is on the dock and the tower position is the crows nest
<Vordox> here*
<Vordox> OrpheusAntony__: As for question.... Hmm
<Reikim> Vordox: Behold, Dali: http://cdn.head-fi.org/0/06/06d60f84_salvador-dali-metamorphosis-of-narcissus.jpeg
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: that's the one :)
<Vordox> Holy crap...that's a lovely image
<Shizuka> 13i liked writing crater island
<Vordox> OrpheusAntony__: Just so you know, your message got cut off.
*Lunar_Brony is lost
<Alpha-Omega> Better name than my old one
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> OrpheusAntony: Q1: What is the current gen of Mlp?
<Shizuka> 13not quite as much fun as jungle island, but let me explore my protagonist a bit
<Wormwood> Reikim: It's just that you previously posted that you had "formal art training". My bad.
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: I never did catch that darn frog 6_9
<Reikim> Vordox: Salvador Dali also had one hell of a moustache. It's even better than Meanwhile's! http://www.mibba.com/data/images/content/people/men/salvador-dali.jpg
<Mesh> Man the frog trap puzzle was the one I never really got
<Quick_Thinker> has any pony seen AgentKalim on yet this week ?
<Mesh> Also closing the doors to get to somewhere but uh
<Shizuka> 13i learned to get the frog you set the trap and lower it, and at least have to get down the ladder outside
<Shizuka> 13then it'll catch
<TheKoreanBrony1354> whos computer
<Mesh> don't think the frog trap is actually essential
<Mesh> iirc there's SOME redundancy in the animal hints
<Lost_Brony> Can somepony tell me what the *yay* is going on?
<Shizuka> 13not really but helps you make the connection for the moiety book
<Reikim> Wormwood: Gosh no. That must have been a mistake on my part, my apologies. I haven't had formal training beyond the high school level, unfortunately. Art is not, I think, something I want to do as a career.
<Cypresswolf> I'd place the bait, then go to another island, come back after a few hours and there still wouldnt be a frog in it
<Sumica> 00,10Doom......er I meen myst
<Alpha-Omega> It has been forever since I played Doom
<Quick_Thinker> so no pony has seen AgentKalim yet
<Shizuka> 13the silhouette for the 3 ball is *subtle* since you're usually clicking fast through that tunnel
<CrimsonPhoenix> hey guys, how about...a CMC spin-off series??
<Lost_Brony> Shizuka can you please give me a brief explanation of what's happening?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> the music is scaryer thanjj abriggs
<Vordox> OrpheusAntony__: So this podcast, how far ahead on the plans are you?
<Cypresswolf> Oh my gosh - the Whark! I just remembered the Whark ^_^
<Mesh> Lost Brony we are talking about Riven
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Phase4: Do you have Spiral Knights?
<Reikim> Shizuka: Do you have references to your OC and Vivi's? Because I'll still draw them if you want.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> derp
<Shizuka> 13Lost_Brony: Phase is wandering around looking for the marker switch to get access to Stoneship
<superretroworld> whos this girl tara strong is talking about on her twitter?
<Mesh> Shizuka: Oh god stoneship
<Unnr|Sleep> g´morning all
<Cypresswolf> wait - is it Whark of Wharf?
<Mesh> I had my monitor brightness down too far in that
<Wormwood> Reikim: Heh, I was just curious about your background in it art, being an artist myself.
<Mesh> checked a walk through
<CrimsonPhoenix> kiki?
<Shizuka> 13wahrk
<Lost_Brony> Shizuka oh. What's Stoneship?
<Mesh> WHAT FUCKING SWITCH!!!?!?!?
<Shizuka> 13you will see
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's a girl with cancer
<TheKoreanBrony1354> what firetrucking game is this
<CrimsonPhoenix> she personally know her
<Phase4> 00,02Red_Pegasus|RedSpy, nope
<IshBestPony> Acknowledge me, give me attention and feed my ego if you didn't do that FBI check and still have internet
<Shizuka> 13i LOVE stoneship in realmyst
<superretroworld> poor thing :(
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Phase4: You should get it, it's a fun game.
<Mesh> It's sort of a shame that most of the companies trying to rip off myst missed the point completely
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey guys!
<TheKoreanBrony1354> seriously
<Reikim> Wormwood: My background isn't as much as I'd like, but I still enjoy art as one of the few things that keeps me sane. What training do you have?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> have any of yu heard of BAND OF BRONIES
<Cypresswolf> I love this verion - the room isnt pitch dark
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hello everyone pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> Heard of it
<Lost_Brony> hi TheKoreanBrony1354
<Lost_Brony> I'm lost
<CrimsonPhoenix> not really following it persay
<IshBestPony> goodbye TheKoreanBrony1354
<Reikim> CrimsonPhoenix: *per se
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I just now recorded me singing a tweaked version of it
<CrimsonPhoenix> thank you
<TheKoreanBrony1354> i not leaving
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I tweaked the lyrics a bit
<Lost_Brony> I can't unwrap this white chocalte
<Cypresswolf> couldnt see the back walls in the original - all there was was a single light shining above the pool and that wall panel
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> and sang it in the tune of "Can't buy me Love"
<Lost_Brony> stupid chocolate!
<TheKoreanBrony1354> dose anypony like superpony beat
<Shizuka> 13i already kind of spoiled the entry puzzle for this one last week...
<IshBestPony> TheKoreanBrony1354 from now on I don''t say the opposite of what I'm supposed to say
<Wormwood> Reikim: Mostly just highschool art classes. I'm mostly self-taught.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> art of the dress dubsteped
<IshBestPony> It won't confuse anypony
<Lost_Brony> TheKoreanBrony1354 not sure, I've heard of him but I've never heard any of his songs besides "Discord"
<TheKoreanBrony1354> fluttershys lullaby dubsteped
<Reikim> Wormwood: Same here, mostly. Are you pursuing art as a career?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hey Shizuka, I sang a seapony parody of "Strawberry fields" would u like to listen to it?
<XAX> Phase4 or Shizuka: we should play Elevator Source on Gmod one day.
<Alpha-Omega> Yes I have most of their music I might be missing one or two songs
<Cypresswolf> *tries to remember how to raise the ship* Its been a couple years since I played this game
<Wormwood> Reikim: Yes, It's really the only thing I want to do with my life.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> may the best pet win won a award for most liked children song
<IshBestPony> I start College in 10 hours
<TheKoreanBrony1354> good luck
<IshBestPony> I'll need it?
<Lost_Brony> SUCCESS!!
<Reikim> Wormwood: Then do it! I considered art, but finally I decided that I'd rather pursue it as a hobby rather than a career. Much like my writing, actually. They provide counterbalances that maintaini my sanity.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> bring derpy she will help u out
<Lost_Brony> I unwrapped my chocoalte
<Cypresswolf> :) Oh yeah, I remember now
<Bronysith> THE DOCTOR FROM back to the future had a pony

<Mesh> Myst is also interseting in how metafictional it was
<Shizuka> 13my cutie mark is on my profile page
<Mesh> Myst 1 and 3 were basically about the relation between the writer and their art. In a very... literal way.
<Reikim> Thanks Shizuka. Your profile page?
<otakon> YES panda-drawing thank you very much!
<Mesh> But there's also this... meta videogame thing going on.

<Phase4> 00,02o_O
<Zombie_Brony> Shizuka THANK YOU FOR BREAKING THE SILENCE!
<Shizuka> 13phase is starting to see the bad FOV now

<Shizuka> 13dat pump actually
<Zombie_Brony> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG I hope it wasn't what I first thought it was
<Cypresswolf> :) And the water isnt a still picture ^_^ That makes my night complete
<Shizuka> 13unfortunately i don't think any of the water levels drop slowly enough for you to see them, you push the button and POOF water gone
<Zombie_Brony> Shizuka seems legit
<Shizuka> 13makes sense though, the pump station is far enough removed from the three things it pumps out and the tech at the time you wouldn't render water draining
<Shizuka> 13i love this bgm
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> it sounds nice
<Science_Brony> SCIENCE!!!!1!!1
<Cypresswolf> I never saw a single drop of rain fall - all this was still pictures - only the sound of rain while the water drops were frozen in mid air :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so whats the point of Myst again?

<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I thought somepony else was going to correct you, Barbetos :S
<Lunar_Brony> I was typing
<Barbetos> Grammer nazis are getting lazy.
<Shizuka> 13uh oh is he going to brute force it~
<Lunar_Brony> I'm not gonna change my name for that
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I guess so, Barbetos.
<Barbetos> Thats when you copy, delete, correct, paste, and then continue.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> BTW, that's "grammar" :3
<Lunar_Brony> -_(\
<TheKoreanBrony1354> derp it

<Alpha-Omega> Must have that shirt >:(
<Lunar_Brony> Tassadork I like to change my name often. Noramally, I'll use Lunar_Brony or Canadian_Brony. I use Zombie_Brony whenever I kill the chat (which is often)and Science_Brony for a good excuse to yell SCIENCE(!!!1!!1) randomly

<Shizuka> 13i guess the ponies who appreciate exploration have all gone to bed...
<BRONEY_4_LIFE> is it just my compter or is this kinda laging
<Alpha-Omega> Maybe but the puzzles are what it is mainly about
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I'm still here Shizuka.
<Science_Brony> TheRareP0N3 this is a puzzle-adventure-exploration game
<TheRareP0N3> we want ponise.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> ... But I'm watching Doctor Who.
<TheRareP0N3> Science_Brony: lolwut
<Alpha-Omega> Don't worry I'm getting the game later
<Science_Brony> TheRareP0N3 Ponies get streamed during Movie Night
<TheRareP0N3> 4 days..
<Science_Brony> TheRareP0N3 I'm not entirely sure either
<Science_Brony> about the genre of the game
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Does "Adventure" work?
<Alpha-Omega> Adventure Time
<Science_Brony> I think I saw something that Phase4 missed
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I was playing Treasure Adventure Game lately.
<Shamroc> Shizuka: i appreciate exploration!
<Alpha-Omega> Good Show
<Shamroc> and im not asleep

<Science_Brony> so I tried to wake him up
<Phase4> 00,02why does that lever exist?
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt seem to add much to the puzle

<Canadian_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE that depends on what kind of fic you're looking for
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I could drive to his house and wake him up :P
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> *ahem* Shamroc... A SEXY FEMALE SWORDSMAN WITH A HUNK OF MEAT JUST SHOWED UP.

<BRONY_4_LIFE> well i just reed my little dashie:'(
<SparklyWaffles> BRONY_4_LIFE tis the saddest story ever.
<Tassadork|melting> BRONY_4_LIFE: I actually could not finish it
<Canadian_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE oh . . . *sniff*
<Alpha-Omega> I finished it
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> It's sad, yet I didn't cry.
<Alpha-Omega> It made me mad and sad
*Rain trys to navigate her way to the fireplace without bumping her nose against anything while she tries to rub her eyes
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i did
<Alpha-Omega> There is a sequel but it is not made by the same person. Although I liked it
<wutweeaboo> do what now?
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> You haven't shown up at Vancouver lately, Rain. That's very strange for Vancouver weather :S
<BRONY_4_LIFE> hey a guy i know told me to read cupcakes it any good
<SparklyWaffles> O_O
<SparklyWaffles> NO.
<wutweeaboo> [23:12] [wutweeaboo(+ix)] [1:ponychat/#geek(+JPgntz)]
<Rain> eh, someone from Vancouver insulted my mum he did
<Alpha-Omega> I think it is the evil one about Pinkamena
<Rain> so I just said "fine" and decided to not hang out with that guy
<Sweetie_Belle> i got a tiny bit of rainfall...but it was a sprinkle..not allot
<Canadian_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE do NOT read Cupcakes! It is the one thing that will ruin any happiness left in you and make you fear the sight of Pinkamena Diane Pie!
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> It probably wasn't me, I don't think I'd like to insult anypony's mum.
<Tassadork|melting> BRONY_4_LIFE: reading cupcakes is kind of a rite of passage for most bronies. but recommending it would be like hazing ...
<SparklyWaffles> BRONY_4_LIFE Listen to Canadian_Brony man... Just don't do it.
<BRONY_4_LIFE> and it has pinkie pie
<Alpha-Omega> No I love Pinkie too much to let something like thgat change my image of her
<BRONY_4_LIFE> proble a not a good idear i like pinkie pie
<Canadian_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE all I can say is read at your own risk. It's rated Mature for a good reason on FimFiction.net. It has serious gore and a sick twist
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i wonder why its called cupcakes
<SparklyWaffles> *shutters* ...you don't wanna know...
<Alpha-Omega> Buck that I'm not into that crazy *yay*
<Alpha-Omega> Flesh that is all
<Canadian_Brony> BRONY_4_LIFE you do not want to know
<BRONY_4_LIFE> okey dokey lokey
*Canadian_Brony shudders
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I liek cupcakez :3
<Alpha-Omega> I've herd about it
<Alpha-Omega> :D
<BRONY_4_LIFE> pinkie pie or rainbow dash is my fav pony
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> ... but I'm not too big on the fic.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Just saying
<Ponies47> I love everypony! :3
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> :O
<Canadian_Brony> a really funny story would be "Pinkie Learns a New Word". Basically, Pinkie learns the word f*ck. That is all I can say
<Canadian_Brony> the rest is history
<Alpha-Omega> They all hold a specail place in my heart :D
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Oh my god, that's cute and quite vulgar xD
<SparklyWaffles> Ponies47 woo hoo! x3
<BRONY_4_LIFE> i allmost forgot about drepy derpy is one of my favs 2

<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I'm Spartacus!
*Sumica passes out and falls on Rain
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Whoa, it's a flying yay!
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: FOUND SOME READINGS! :D
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami|DoctorWho I read that in the voice of Carrel Channing
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Oh my

<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 really? Nice.

*Rain hugs Sumica
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Lunar_Brony, imagine a million Polydunami's saying, "I'm Polydunami". That's kind of the Spartacus thing.
<Ponies47> *yes
<MadSurge> I'm falling awake :D
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
*Sumica hugs Rain back
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Oh yeah. That's Carol Channing.
<Shizuka> 13rain rain~<3
<Tassadork|melting> if you are of a sciency bent and would like a good laugh, I highly recommend a little fanfic called "Naked Singularity" on fim fiction
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami|DoctorWho the reason I heard it in the voice of Carol Channing was because it was from "Whose Line is it Anyway?"
*Rain hugs Shizuka tightly
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I know, I saw that one xD
<Shamroc> .....what is goin on in this chat..
<Science_Brony> Tassadork|melting I was considering that!
<SparklyWaffles> Shamroc EVERYTHIIING.
<CrimsonPhoenix> HEY Who wants to see an epic magic duel between Trixie and Twilight?
<MadSurge> Shamroc: people falling asleep and early birds awakening :D
<xxMoopyxx> ok i have a question fo everypony
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Shoot.
<Shamroc> no
<Alpha-Omega> Hay away
<Tassadork|melting> Science_Brony: you can't go wrong
<Science_Brony> Shamroc well, I yelled "SCIENCE(!!!1!!1)" in your ear, put fresh bacon under your nose, and Fus Ro Dah'd you to wake you up. Nothing worked
<xxMoopyxx> On youtube how do these guys see ponies in real life?
<Shamroc> Science_Brony: oh i know..if you looked the bacon is gone...;p
<CrimsonPhoenix> xxMoopyxx, video editing
<Science_Brony> xxMoopyxx Photoshop]
<xxMoopyxx> oh ok
<CrimsonPhoenix> how old are you?
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> You know, CrimsonPhoenix, that wouldn't be a very fair battle. Twilight would KILL Trixie.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> brain activity slowly decreasing

<Polydunami|DoctorWho> ... How do I know who's winning?
<Tassadork|melting> trixie playing aggro, twi playing control...
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I know nothing about Magic.
<Shizuka> 13seems legit
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami|DoctorWho, you know the magic rules
<Shizuka> 13x100
<Wormwood> It would be a curbstomp battle. Trixie wouldn't stand a chance.
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami|DoctorWho nobody knows who's playing in Magic. Especially the players
<CrimsonPhoenix> really?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> madness i play healer

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm
<Flyboy> The Plot Thickens
<Shizuka> 13he's also unlocked rime for you which is pretty much exploration for exploration's sake, though there's an easter egg pointing at riven at the end
<SparklyWaffles> ._.
<Shizuka> 13when sirrus and achenar started getting power crazy, they tricked atrus into coming here to D'ni with an incomplete myst book
<SparklyWaffles> so much pink.
<Shizuka> 13with atrus out of the way, they destroyed the library until the red and blue books remained
<SparklyWaffles> TOO MUCH PINK.

<DeadpoolDash> pyroland is bexst land
<Flyboy> Fairyshuff: dont you mean stockings
<Phase4> 00,02z-fighting in the book XD
<Shizuka> 13lol that corrupted page
<FairysHuff> Flyboy It depends on my mood. I like both. Thigh high socks? Yum.

<FairysHuff> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/027/c/8/twilight_sparkle_and_more_socks_by_jungleanimal-d4nr8yp.png
<Phase4> 00,02not sure where last two are
<Shizuka> 13you touch the pads under the imager
<AdamTheDuck> FairysHuff ... really?
<Shizuka> 13let me save you the trouble http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs06/22 http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs06/23
<Shizuka> 13cause they're really finicky
<FairysHuff> AdamTheDuck Hey I didn't create it ^_^
<Flyboy> -.(\
<AdamTheDuck> the internet never ceases to amaze me...
<Shizuka> 13phase is gonna play god for a while now :3
<Canadian_Brony> Flyboy this is a facehoof: -_(\
<Canadian_Brony> -_(\
<FairysHuff> I'm gonna play perverted old man for while.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> o_o
<Canadian_Brony> FairysHuff that will get you kicked and banned
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony ...Does it matter? 6_9
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> I prefer human shapes, myself :/
<Flyboy> and this is a hoofpunch: /)*(-.-)
<Canadian_Brony> SparklyWaffles not really.
<Shizuka> 13i like how the books aren't a pile of ash on the floow but a crater in the wall
<FairysHuff> Canadian_Brony I'm joking silly filly ^_^
<Canadian_Brony> /)_(\
<Shizuka> 13did atrus hadouken them to death?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm?
<Canadian_Brony> wut?
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony /)^3^(\
<Shizuka> 13anyway phase that second pic is a shot from riven, it's a continuity nod
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, three of the crystals are on the age with the rotating fort right?
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Canadian_Brony> SparklyWaffles I can't think of anything else
<Shizuka> 13basically the crystal viewer takes five crystals of certain shapes and colors
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony Yes, i win!
<Shizuka> 13you click the pads to change the shape, and mouseover to change color
<Flyboy> SO CONFUSING!
<Phase4> 00,02oh
<Phase4> 00,02i see
<Shizuka> 13when you recreate the combination on the note it gives that image, but it's stupid finicky
<Canadian_Brony> Flyboy is U confuzzled?
<Shizuka> 13revelation does the concept better
<Canadian_Brony> chat derp, or serious lag?
<Flyboy> Canadian_Brony: maybe a bit confuzzled, yeah
<Ponies47> /)^3^(\
<Canadian_Brony> -_(\
<Zach> just here to check on you all anything new?
<Tassadork> /) * ︵ ┻━┻
<SparklyWaffles> xD
<Canadian_Brony> I feel like glomping somepony . . .
<FairysHuff> I just found a pic of Twilight thats even more disturbing but I won't link it. ^_^
<Zach> hey look i put my name in
<SparklyWaffles> o_o
<Alpha-Omega> Glomping?
<Canadian_Brony> hi Zach
<Canadian_Brony> Alpha-Omega yes. The attack-hug
*Canadian_Brony glomps Alpha-Omega
<Shizuka> 13like i said it's just stupid finicky, you can barely tell the difference between green and cyan and that's enough to break the puzzle
<Flyboy> FairysHuff: oh no go ahead, i can bet you ive seen worse
<SparklyWaffles> somepony better prepare themselves...
<Custard> I haven't been on bronystate for a while~ Hi everypony :)
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Hey Custard
<Canadian_Brony> SparklyWaffles for what?
<Zach> most ppl know me as ChronoClutch but I didn't feel like typing it in except nao
<SparklyWaffles> Hi Custard :)
<Canadian_Brony> hi Custard
<Zach> well have fun :P
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Also, Hey Zaxh
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> *Zach
<Alpha-Omega> ahh assault
<SparklyWaffles> Canadian_Brony nothing. ;)
<FairysHuff> Flyboy More than likely. I remember the *ahem* Special anantomically correct plush that was linked here.
<Canadian_Brony> Zach I see. I am also known as Lunar_Brony, Zombie_Brony, Science_Brony, and Very_Lost_Brony
<Flyboy> aaah... rught
<Flyboy> right*
*Canadian_Brony glomps SparklyWaffles
<Zach> Canadian_Brony a man of many names
<Lunar_Brony> Zach that's me!
<Zach> :O
<FairysHuff> This pic is nothing compaired to that plush pic.
<Science_Brony> SCIENCE!!!1!!1
<Phase4> 00,02not sure if worked
<Zach> k I will be back gunna watch season 2 episode 4 wof mlp fim
<SparklyWaffles> :O I was glomped.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: in Riven, the Star Fissure is implied to be a void between Ages
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> That's a good episode.
<Shizuka> 13so presumably if you've entered a crystal combo that doesn't point anywhere
<Shizuka> 13you get the stars
<Science_Brony> SparklyWaffles yes. Yes you were.
<CECtheRonin> What is this game?
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Myst
<Phase4> 00,02colours!
<Lunar_Brony> my name didn't change
<Phase4> 00,02y u no more saturated
<Lunar_Brony> CECtheRonin Myst
<Shizuka> 13this is the very end of realmyst
<Shizuka> 13ikr phase
<FairysHuff> Hmm... seems I can't link it as I get redirected to another site before it loads O-o Fucking internet.
<CECtheRonin> Lunar_Brony Really? That looks way different from the Myst of my youth.
<SparklyWaffles> Language, my friend!
<AdamTheDuck> that might be a problem with your router FairysHuff
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: i think the second crystal is supposed to have a cut top, not the pointy one you have
<Flyboy> far right
*Lunar_Brony is too tired to care
<FairysHuff> AdamTheDuck Nah. It's only doing it with this one pic
<AdamTheDuck> ah ok
<FairysHuff> AdamTheDuck So more likely the site
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> CECtheRonin, it's realMyst. Pretty much a graphical adaptation of Myst.
<Flyboy> far right to purple
<FairysHuff> Just as well I suppose.
<CECtheRonin> Polydunami|DoctorWho Ahh, I see.
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> It's on steam.
<Phase4> 00,02i love how the screen trolls you
<Shizuka> 13far right one needs to be purple
<SparklyWaffles> *gives Lunar_Brony energy pill* Stay awake!
<Phase4> 00,02its soo close to purple
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<Shizuka> 13they didn't think this one through very well
<Flyboy> its blue...
<FairysHuff> I just saw something I didn't need to see. ~_~ Rarity with all the girly parts added.
<Shizuka> 13there's riven~
<Flyboy> click it!
<Shizuka> 13specifically
<Flyboy> cliiick iiiiit!
<Shizuka> 13http://tkj.vortalcord.net/imgbox/lvs07/10 there
<Shizuka> 13but yeah that's realmyst~
<Lunar_Brony> SparklyWaffles what? Did I say I was tired?
<Alpha-Omega> Then stop looking it up
<Phase4> 00,02so thats it?
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02was kinda hoping for more in that last thing
<Shizuka> 13yup, myst kind of.. ends..
<Polydunami|DoctorWho> Uhh, is that pony-shaped or human-shaped, FairysHuff?
<Shizuka> 13riven picks up immediately after
<Phase4> 00,02not bad
<SparklyWaffles> Lunar_Brony you said you were too tired to care. Thus, PROOF YOU'RE GETTING SLEEPY!
<FairysHuff> Polydunami|DoctorWho Kinda both.
<Shizuka> 13not bad for 1993 :3
<Phase4> 00,0293?
<Lunar_Brony> !lottery glomp
<FairysHuff> Polydunami She's reclining on a bed
<Phase4> 00,02this game is as old as me
<Shizuka> 13when original myst was done ja
<Lunar_Brony> "Glomp" is not registered .. .
<Alpha-Omega> It's older than me
<Lunar_Brony> -_(\
<Phase4> 00,02for a 93 game to feel fun in 2012
<Phase4> 00,02you know its a good game
<AdamTheDuck> well... that was very anti-climactic...
<SparklyWaffles> o.o
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Lunar_Brony> !lottery give Coca-Cola
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, was a bit
<Phase4> 00,02but its a very calm game
<Lunar_Brony> why won't "!lottery" work?
<Shizuka> 13for you ponies who "myst" realMyst, plug plug! http://tkj.vortalcord.net/
<FairysHuff> I'm 13 years older than the game.
<Phase4> 00,02Lunar_Brony, gameserv is turned off in here afaik
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 aww, okay
<Polydunami> You mean older games aren't usually fun, Phase4?
<FairysHuff> Polydunami I disagree with that statement.
<DashieMusic2> well he didnt say that
<Polydunami> Me too.
<Shizuka> 13time for phase to mess with atmospheric electricity some more :3
<Alpha-Omega> what about mario
<Shizuka> 13can you imagine how much power must be flowing through those things
<Shizuka> 13to make arcs that huge
<Lunar_Brony> why is he making the Aurora Borealis?
<FairysHuff> HAH HAH!! I found a safe one ^_^
<FairysHuff> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qKwXD2At40M/Tq9V2yrB0zI/AAAAAAAAQTg/JZzRMMQ_MLg/s1600/mlp_fim_luna_woona_by_atticus83-d4a5exi.png
<Lunar_Brony> again?
<Tassadork> must be giving off a lot of radiation too/
<Rain> it is exciting the molicules in the air, Lunar_Brony
<Shizuka> 13rime is so cold the ocean is like one big superconductor, iirc
<Phase4> 00,02mattel interactive?
<Shizuka> 13they published realmyst
<Phase4> 00,02Polydunami, they were fun when they were made
<FairysHuff> Don't forget the electro megnetism.
<Lunar_Brony> Rain I know, but why did he do that? And why are the credits rolling? I missed something
<Shizuka> 13i think they evolved from broderbund, where myst was published originally
<Rain> I have no idea :p
<Lunar_Brony> did the game end?
<Shizuka> 13and one of broderbund's spinoffs published riven
<Phase4> 00,02i liked that
<Shizuka> 13yay~<3
<Phase4> 00,02was definantly worth buying
<Lunar_Brony> Phase4 I missed something. What was with the credits?
<Lunar_Brony> did you win?
<Phase4> 00,02i clicked the about realmyst button
<Alpha-Omega> I'll get the ipad version
<Phase4> 00,02i won
<Phase4> 00,02kinda
<Phase4> 00,02i solved the puzles and wasnt trapped there forever
<Shizuka> 13impatient ponies can go here http://tkj.vortalcord.net/journal/lvs07
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm i said My Little pony on Cleverbot, it said thats a fantastic show O_O
<Shizuka> 13yes i am relentlessly plugging my writing...
<FairysHuff> I wonder if the cases of people who live under power lines getting cancer and other health issues are true. There has been quite a lot of them so not all of them can be fake. And not all of them can be flukes. CUrious.
<Lunar_Brony> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 clever
<FairysHuff> Hallo Kammerjunk
<Phase4> 00,02bit low on space
<Lunar_Brony> FairysHuff it's possible there could be a connection, but IDK
<Phase4> 00,02theres 5GB left on that partition
<Shizuka> 13oh my
<Shizuka> 13how can you stand it ><
<Lunar_Brony> I don't feel like scincing right now
<JRP2234[Web]> http://logs.omegle.com/88b322
<FairysHuff> Lunar_Brony Yes. It takes study that companies aren't willing to invest in.
<Lunar_Brony> *sciencing
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, ~90% of my drive is alocated to linux
<Flyboy> gtg in 7 minutes
<Shizuka> 13oh there is that
<DeadpoolDash> i really need to move my pron to an external drive(to free up space)
<Flyboy> so did you finish it?
<Phase4> 00,02i finished it
<Alpha-Omega> I have a terrabyte of memory on my computer
<FairysHuff> 90% of my drive is allocated to anime and games.
<Flyboy> sonovabitch i missed it
<Phase4> 00,028 hours of gameplay
<Shizuka> 13cause shizu kept spoiling .-.
<Flyboy> oh i see!
<Flyboy> realmyst leads up to riven
<Flyboy> am i right
<Shizuka> 13yes myst led directly into riven
<Flyboy> :)
<Shizuka> 13or rather, riven, when it was released 4 years later, picks up immediately where myst leaves off
<Shizuka> 13exile is some 10 years later, revelation 10 years after that
<Shizuka> 13uru and 5 are present day, some 200 years after the first four
<FairysHuff> Correct me if I'm wrong but power lines create a strong electro magnetic field right? Not too strong but strong enough.
<Phase4> 00,02gota stand up for a while
*Phase4 00,02hugs Shizuka
*Shizuka 13hugs phase~
<Shizuka> 13glad you liked~<3
<Flyboy> silly FairysHuff, only magic can create forcefeilds :)
<FairysHuff> Anyone mind if I link a youtube music video? Not mines.
<Flyboy> sure
<Alpha-Omega> nope
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/liHq08Cayp4
<Phase4> 00,02will probably play riven in my own time
<FairysHuff> Forcefields are friendships way of saying "Talk to the hand"

*alexxm hugs Alchemist
<Alchemist> hi alexxm :) its been, uneventful...
<Saturn> 08,01which bits are you having trouble with?

<Alchemist> can you tie them in a knot, can you tie them in a bow?
<alexxm> yep thats what i got

<Saturn> 08,01# kin ye weech 'em past yer shoulder, like a giant wi a boulder, dae yer taaats haaang looo #
<Phase4> 00,02what i want to know is wether a flash embed considers its local domain to be the domain its hosted on or the domain its embeded in
<Saturn> 08,01weech = to chuck
<Phase4> 00,02problem is i have no way to test
<Phase4> 00,02unless
<Saturn> 08,01pronounced like "week", but with the "ch" as in "loch"
<Saturn> 08,01as in "jobby weecha"
<Alchemist> Saturn: never heard that word before.
<alexxm> bye guys
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: it's scottish

<Phase4> 00,02http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Gentoo#Installation
<XAX> Im currently lying on the floor of my computer room waiting for something to copy to my xternal HD.
<XAX> I suddenly realize,
<XAX> god the carpet in here is shit.
<Saturn> 08,01# oh ye cannae flings pieces oot a twentae story flat / seven hunnerd hungry weans wull testify tae that / iffits buter cheese or jeely, if the breid is plain or pan / the odds against it reaching earth are ninetae-nine tae one #
<VioletGreySha|drawin> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: uuh couldnt see that from your name ;P
<Saturn> 08,01that's a song about flinging sandwiches out the window of a high-rise flat
<Alchemist> XAX: Me and my roommates dont clean that often either...
<XAX> Alchemist: Nah, it's just really thin and hard. Like it is as old as the house.
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, an excelent reason for a song
<Saturn> 08,01# I'm a skyscraper wean; I live on the nineteenth flair / But I'm no' gaun oot tae play ony mair / 'Cause since we moved tae Castlemilk, I'm wastin' away / 'Cause I'm getting' wan meal less every day #
<Saturn> 08,01i hope you enjoyed this nosedive into scottish culture
<Alchemist> XAX: throw it out. It just good for getting extremely dusty and have insects in it anyways.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Gamecube game for linux?

<MadSurge> Saturn, will you walk amongst us mortals at BUCK? Can't wait to meet you in person :D
<Alchemist> I've heard irish punk rock before
<Saturn> 08,01this probably isn't as funny to you lot
<Saturn> 08,01but let me give you a brief backgroudn
<Saturn> 08,01i'm from a place called Fife
<Saturn> 08,01which is a county in Scotland
<Saturn> 08,01directly north of Edinburgh
<Saturn> 08,01people from Edinburgh hate Fife
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> apparently Canterlot Gardens is near where i live, sucks im not gunna go
<Saturn> 08,01hell, even *i* hate Fife
<MadSurge> :D
<Saturn> 08,01even though i'm from there, i'm at heart an adopted Edinburgher
<Saturn> 08,01it's called the Kingdom of Fife, technically
<Saturn> 08,01and Fifers are very proud
<Saturn> 08,01except me
<Saturn> 08,01i hate the place
<Saturn> 08,01basically, if you've read Discworld, it's like Scrote
<Saturn> 08,01it's where all the counry's produce comes from
<Saturn> 08,01they're all farmers there, basically
<Saturn> 08,01and people on the dole

<Phase4> 00,02then again this is the same company that makes java
<Saturn> 08,01some Sun stuff as okay
<Saturn> 08,01until... *sigh*, Oracle
<Phase4> 00,02and they were open source friendly
<Phase4> 00,02at the very least, they were the lesser of two evils when compared to oracle
<Phase4> 00,02which as far as i can tell is doing nothing but suing right now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> chat derp
<Invi> hi Phase4. Somehow I can't get on bronystate; Error messege ''502 Bad Gateway''|cloudflare-nginx
<Hrafn> oh sweet, I just found an article about bronies in a Swedish newspaper, and it reflects bronies in a pretty accurate and positive way :)
<Saturn> 08,01nice!
<Invi> yay
<Phase4> 00,02i think its at your end

<Hrafn> uh ohs :o
<Phase4> 00,02if so its a cloudflare problem, prety serious one
<Invi> yep black and white
<Invi> just that text
<MadSurge> Saturn: where's the evil laugh? :D
<Saturn> 08,01<chrysalis>HAHAHAHAHAHA</chrysalis>
<Invi> and it's only bronystate. other websites do work
<MadSurge> Magnificent. *sheds single tear*

<Phase4> 00,02strange
<Phase4> 00,02server is up
<MadSurge> Saturn: are the tickets to BUCK limited?
<Phase4> 00,02Invi, try again, ctrl+f5
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: yes, but we have abotu 200 remaining
<Invi> I'm doing that all the time. now it says, that it lost connection.

<Phase4> 00,02DeadpoolDash, webserver
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<MadSurge> Ooh, better talk with my parents and see if we can work it out :D
<Phase4> 00,02leave it for a few minutes, that might be its anti-bad stuff thing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hehe
<Phase4> 00,02socket.setSoTimeout(0x2bf20);
<Phase4> 00,02dat might take a while to timeout
<Invi> ok then. thank you :)

<DeadpoolDash> all teh tabs
<Phase4> 00,02DeadpoolDash, its absurdly few actually
<DeadpoolDash> how many is alot?
<Phase4> 00,02~400
<Phase4> 00,02average is around 200
<DeadpoolDash> why would you have that many open?
<Phase4> 00,02most of them not needed of course
<Phase4> 00,02lazyness
<Phase4> 00,02cbf closing them and its quicker to have one in memory and use the navbar to jump to it than load it again
<Phase4> 00,02 long l = System.currentTimeMillis();
<Phase4> 00,02 long l2 = l + 0x5265c00L;
<Phase4> 00,02 long l3 = l + 0x36ee80L;
<Phase4> 00,02yay for.... whatever that is
<DeadpoolDash> I try to stay below 10, fiefox gets all buggy with more then that and starts eating memory
<Phase4> 00,02odd,
<Rain> Phase4, how do I stay on the things when on a surf map?
<Phase4> 00,02on my old laptop it took at least 50 tabs to break 700MB
<Rain> they like to just let me slide off to my death
<Phase4> 00,02Rain, use left and right
<Phase4> 00,02push into the angle
<Rain> I do :|
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma join your server

<Phase4> 00,02i'm bored with java right now
<brony_swan> join you?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what to spend time on
<Phase4> 00,02sure
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: rewrite the entire thing in Haskell
<Phase4> 00,02i'm on 81.166.125.12:20300
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, dont think i'm ever going to get haskell
<Phase4> 00,02just a little too different
<Saturn> 08,01i love haskell
<shana> go lisp!
<shana> haven't seen much haskell outside of academia
*Saturn 08,01works in academia
<Saturn> 08,01this is why i like haskell :P
*shana is a student
<shana> yup love haskell as a language :D
<Saturn> 08,01hahaha <3
<shana> I can implement many algorithms in it..
<shana> but beyond that..
<brony_swan> you still there
<shana> can't think how I'd implement some application in a 'pure' way
<Starflash> Good morning everyone
<Saturn> 08,01shana: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504
<Saturn> 08,01AMAZING book
<Saturn> 08,01examples in ML *and* Haskell!
<brony_swan> Phase4: you still there
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02i just realised that being > 18
<Phase4> 00,02i have access to money
<Phase4> 00,02and can buy books
<shana> Saturn: yeah datastructures are nice an such, but what about programs with complicated control flow.. like ui applications with tons of event handlers and stuff..
<shana> I don't know any graphical haskell application except xmonad
<brony_swan> whats the ip for the server?
<shana> 81.166.125.12:20300 maybe
<FairysHuff> Morning my pumpernickle ponys.
<FairysHuff> Well its morning kind of for me as I just got up
<Saturn> 08,01shana: there are some *excellent* graphic and animation drawing libraries for Haskell
<MadSurge> Hi FairysHuff!
<FairysHuff> MadSurge Holla
<FairysHuff> MadSurge Hows yee?
<brony_swan> that aint the ip
<shana> Saturn: do you use haskell for software projects?
<brony_swan> Phase4: you got the ip for the server your on?
<Phase4> 00,0281.166.125.12:20300
<Phase4> 00,02i think
<brony_swan> tried it already
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Phase4> 00,02203.34.186.32:27075
<Saturn> 08,01shana: sometimes
<Saturn> 08,01i wrote an implementation of RSA in Haskell
<shana> hmm doesn't haskell have a native bignum library?
<XAX> Phase4: There's bound to be something on CSS you'd like. Theres craploads of gamemodes.
<shana> isn't that hard then ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, but soo much download
<Unnr> Allos all!
<Saturn> 08,01eeyup
<Phase4> 00,02DAT SLAPS ME ON DE KNEE
<XAX> Phase4: Not every server has store and all that crap. It's only maps really.
<Saturn> 08,01and, to be honest, writing RSA in haskell was beautiful to write
<FairysHuff> Anyone got any advice for Apps to get for Android? Not games.
<Saturn> 08,01i love writing algos in haskell
<XAX> But yeah, some maps are big :$
<shana> yup it is
<Phase4> 00,02thats a heck of a turn you have to make on this map
<XAX> Phase4: You back on TF2 again?
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02yay
<Phase4> 00,02level change
<XAX> Phase4: Oh yeah, Surfing started in CSS. I could find a decent Surf server tomorrow. An Australian one :p
<Phase4> 00,02:D
<Phase4> 00,02that'd be good
<XAX> Wait. Not just CSS. It started in the valve engine in general.
<FairysHuff> Rather quiet today no?
<shana> I like a good mix of functional programming and imperative
<XAX> There were CS 1.6 surf
*XAX maps
<XAX> Dafuq why did that /me
<shana> well what did you type?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> XAX: lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh god that Holy mackeral head glitch
<XAX> Oh by the way Phase4, you'd be surprised how much skill that skill surf maps actually take. They're fucking impossible some of them.
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02like the previous one
<XAX> When you have time, YouTube search "surf_overgrowth"
<XAX> that shit's amazing
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, HOLY
<Phase4> 00,02i'm jelly
<Phase4> 00,02dat guys got skills
<Phase4> 00,02allso not posible to do that on touchpad
<XAX> Yeah.
<XAX> I've actually talked to the guy who made that map
<Phase4> 00,02very precise
<XAX> Deepest voice you'll ever hear lol
<Phase4> 00,02he's screwign up actually, the video i have
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<XAX> Phase4: I asked him what sensitivity he used to surf. 0.3 apparently.
<XAX> His mousepad must take up half his desk.
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02need the precision
<XAX> Another CSS video I'd recommend is "phoon too much for zblock"
<XAX> that's the definition of rape via "game mechanic abuse", according to Shamrocs lol
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Phase4> 00,02getting 100fps while streaming
<Phase4> 00,02dats new
<Unnr> mmm CSS source engine abuse
<XAX> Unnr: You watching it? :o
<Phase4> 00,02dat sllaps me on the knee
<Atler_Tempest> =_=
<Phase4> 00,02i have k bound to explode

<sprinkle_GS17> btw was bronystate down earlier today?
<Twilight_S> Bronysith said your little brother told him, then Bronystate.
<Princess_Molestia> Im going to kill him!
<Unnr|Shower> sprinkle_GS17: The CS GO beta makes me scared for the next generation of CS. T__T
<Atler_Tempest> yeah, cause rumor trains are so reliable... =_=

<Princess_Molestia> Goodbye Twilight_S
<Unnr|Shower> sprinkle_GS17: Magic. *snort* *snort*
<sprinkle_GS17> Atler_Tempest: CS is better than most fps today. and it was made by valve!
<sprinkle_GS17> Unnr|Shower: i smell shenanigans
<Unnr|Shower> not so much better as more brutal and a bit more rewarding for precision play
<sprinkle_GS17> ^
<Atler_Tempest> sprinkle_GS17: just cause it was made by valve, doesnt mean i have to like it... ive played it and i hate it... feels a bit to CoD at time to me...
<sprinkle_GS17> yeah, CS is fun and balanced
<sprinkle_GS17> Atler_Tempest: lol except that its been out way before COD
<Unnr|Shower> CS... balanced? Do we play the same game?
<Sallymeow1> so...who likes pie :D
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) *yawns*
<Unnr|Shower> G´Morning! o/
<sprinkle_GS17> hai Sylandest

<VioletGreySha|drawin> Atler_Tempest: they did cause teh chat is dead
<Atler_Tempest> this is why i tend to only lurk now... too much drama and too much attention whoring... ffs...
<VioletGreySha|drawin> Atler_Tempest: indeed
<Unnr|Shower> It wouldn´t be BS without drama, though. BS is like the highschool cafeteria of ponychat
<VioletGreySha|drawin> Unnr: well its still anoin for many people
<VioletGreySha|drawin> well for me not

<killerpony7733> ^More like anarchy central
<PonyNegZero> awww... I just watched the coffee machine get taken by the training group - how am I supposed to make it through the day today...
<Ghosties> 04Hello once more
<Bronysith> hi Ghosties
<Sylandest> morning, sir Ghosties
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Ghosties.
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, Ghosties
<VioletGreySha|drawin> indeed Ghosties
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi Ghosties
<VioletGreySha|drawin> Ghosties: you got somethin i should draw you yet? :P
<Ghosties> 04Not yet, Violet
<Ghosties> 04But thanks again
<Ghosties> 04So, how is everyone?
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-tell-me.jpg
<Bronysith> fine Ghosties and you?
<Ghosties> 04I just killed an innumerable amount of people in Deus Ex Human Revolution. This morning started off well.
<Saturn> 08,01lulz
<Bronysith> hey Saturn
<PonyNegZero> Ghosties: pretty well, just writing some code here at work (bummed that the coffee machine was stolen my training)
<killerpony7733> Saturn: Hiya
<Ghosties> 04Writing code? Where do you work?
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Saturn.
<Sylandest> howdy, Saturn!
<PonyNegZero> Ghosties: The company is rather small, but I write code.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: gender issues, dumb male is better than klutzy female
<Kammerjunk> Morning in Paris, the city awakes to the bells of Notre Dame. The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes to the bells of Notre Dame.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ill-stick-with-ponies-thanks.jpg
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: good song is good
*AttacktheAndalite hugs Saturn
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: I concur.
<PonyNegZero> (no offence Ghosties... I'd just rather not say, I hope you understand)
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-what-is-this-i-dont-even.png
<Ghosties> 04Lol is it another brony site or something?
<PonyNegZero> Ghosties: no, it has nothing to do with MLP sadly, but that doesn't mean I don't wear my brony wristband and have RD on top of my monitor...
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-that-awful-moment-when-paranoid-parrot-kicks-in.jpg
<Ghosties> 04So then you must work for some super serious company :o
<Bronysith> Ghosties: he works for unatco
<Ghosties> 04Or Sarif Industries
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: I heard they only get lemon lime and not orange in their soda machines
<Ghosties> 04So he either never asked for it, or it's a shame he did.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-guess-it-was-too-important-to-rename.jpg
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: Ghosties You two get 100 internets eachs
<killerpony7733> each*
<Bronysith> WOOT Ghosties /)
<Ghosties> 04(\
<Ghosties> 04Is there a stream going?
<killerpony7733> Nope
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-you-love-ponies-too.png
<Bronysith> this happened to me before actually
<Jim> eek
*Bronysith glomps and licks Jim
<MadSurge> Bronysith: people humming pony songs? :D
<Jim> Ohai!
<PonyNegZero> I got a brohoof at the airport once (in front of my parents - they were very confused)
<MadSurge> Hullo Jim!
<Bronysith> MadSurge: i was and someguy sang it with me
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-rainbow-scout.jpg SCOUT
<Kammerjunk> Dashie is best Scout.
<Bronysith> yes she is
<Bronysith> or is it scout is best rainbow dash?
<Jim> or is scout best pony?
<Ghosties> 04So anyways
<Ghosties> 04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc6PommZKWQ
<MadSurge> Bronysith: a chick I know tagged me into an FB Fluttershy pic as a joke and I was like "so you like them, huh? :$"
<Bronysith> Ghosties: dont spoil anything for me on deus ex
<Bronysith> Ghosties: still playing it
<killerpony7733> Ghosties: Yeah R.I.P
<Jim> I never asked for this
<Lil_B> hi everyone, does somebody want to hear a arrangement I made?
<Ghosties> 04No no, it's just a parody music video for Deus Ex
<Ghosties> 04To be fair, I've never even beaten the original
<Kammerjunk> The old Deus Ex, even (There were only 2)
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-feel-the-love-and-tolerance-welling-up-inside-you1.jpg
<Bronysith> Ghosties: should i get human revolution? i am enjoying the original
<Ghosties> 04YES
<Ghosties> 04HELL YES
<Bronysith> it will most likely go on sale on the steam summer sun celebration sale
<Bronysith> then ill get it
<killerpony7733> I have beaten all three games
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hows the new pony going
<killerpony7733> :D
<Ghosties> 04You can't do a completely pure pacifist run like in the original Deus Ex, unfortunately, but aside from the bosses you don't have to kill anybody.
<Jim> can't wait for the sales
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hey everypony
<Jim> hi TheKoreanBrony1354
<Ghosties> 04The biggest setback for me is lack of New Game+
<Lil_B> hi TheKoreanBrony1354
<Kammerjunk> Steam Summer Sale, the Bringer of Poverty
<Jim> my wallet is not prepared
<TheKoreanBrony1354> whats streaming
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: you mean the fixer of the economy
<MadSurge> Ghosties: same for Shadows of the Damned :D
<Jim> The bringer of candy bars to Gabe Nevel
<TheKoreanBrony1354> i like apples
<Lil_B> reminds me... I wanted to play Killing Floor for the Summer Sideshow :/ that game is really fun XD
<Kammerjunk> Never got into it.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-well-we-know-it-starts-with-a-p.png PORTAL
<MadSurge> Bronysith: twitroll :D
<Kammerjunk> Oh, but didn't you watch the video from Equestrian Innovations? There is a portal.
<Kammerjunk> On the Moon.
<Kammerjunk> The cost for getting there "falls in the ballpark of a lot of money."
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-get-to-work.png space

<Kammerjunk> Assuming the multiverse exists, though, there is a universe for every possible situation.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> eat some doritos and muffins
<Kammerjunk> So not necessarily.
<Lil_B> Bronysith and according to the angle of which Twilight actually sees the nebula, Equestria is somewhere directly between earth and horsehead nebula
<MadSurge> Bronysith: that's some badass Fluttershy <3
<Kammerjunk> Again, theory of multiverse.
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: http://johntb.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4h3ddp
<TheKoreanBrony1354> fluttershy the BAMF
<Lil_B> these guns remind me of the shotgun in Teeworlds
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: It's a "WST-EM Combat Shotgun".
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, that picture is DETAILED.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> is he like playing call of duty
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: WOO WREK that's the best thing he's ever done :D
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Seriously, if you zoom in, you'll see imprints on the goddamn cartridges.
<Kammerjunk> That's attention to detail.
<Kammerjunk> Or shells, or whatever.
<Ghosties> 04Wrek loves guns
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: I wish he made more of that and less fishnet ponies :D Only a little less
<Lil_B> great, wrek is not only good at drawing on a Tablet, hes also skileld in Vectors :( why do I not have a Telent :(
<Ghosties> 04He's crazy about 'em
<Bronysith> Ghosties: you dont say
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-you-dont-attack-the-scootaloos-in-zelda.jpg zelda
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Revenge of the Scootabuse.
<Litwick> Wreks gotta gun fetish?
<MadSurge> Ghosties: I love only impractical guns that shoot crazy stuff :D
<Bronysith> Litwick: everypony has a gun fetish
<MadSurge> Bronysith: I GET IT :D
<Ghosties> 04I wonder if Wrek has Borderlands
<Ghosties> 04He'd probably cherish that game
<Bronysith> yea
<Bronysith> most likely
<Ghosties> 04I've got the GOTY edition and I've only completed one DLC for it
<Ghosties> 04It's pretty damn expansive, gotta admit
<Bronysith> yea
<Bronysith> borderlands was pretty good
<Kammerjunk> Played it once over at a friend's place, didn't really catch me.
<Bronysith> its just diablo with guns
<PonyNegZero> have a very fun gun http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BfU-wMwL2U
<Ghosties> 04Unlike most people I've talked to or most reviews I've read I actually preferred Single Player instead of Co-Op or Multiplayer
<MadSurge> Ghosties: I finished the whole package, it's a pretty good game! My fav gun is a machinegun that shoots really fast and has infinite ammo :D
<Kammerjunk> Hey, I played Mass Effect 3. I want a goddamn harpoon gun in real life.
<Bronysith> Ghosties i beat borderlands single player
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/dq0Joi1ELps
<FairysHuff> Just felt the need to share this
*Bronysith noms on FairysHuff
<FairysHuff> Welcome to america
<FairysHuff> Bronysith Holla
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-even-the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world-cant-hide-his-bronyism-forever.jpg
<FairysHuff> I came across that video while researching native american culture. I got curious how they live today. Not well it seems.
<Bronysith> JOKER is a troll http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-a-very-minty-christmas.jpg
<Sylandest> howdy, FairysHuff!
<Ghosties> 04Native Americans are in danger of "thugification"
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Hallo
<FairysHuff> Ghosties Thugification?
*Sylandest snuggles FairysHuff "How are you today?"
<Ghosties> 04It's a term being used by many legitimate anthropologists today, though it was coined originally by Tupac
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Angry but trying not to be.
<Ghosties> 04"Thugification" is when a man or woman has to turn to street crime just to get by
<Lil_B> Why are all my Valve games recieving updates? Even the ones I haven't installed?
*Sylandest holds FairysHuff "Why are you angry? :O If I may ask"
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: i love language
<Bronysith> Lil_B: its the awesome update
<FairysHuff> Ghosties Ah yes... I know that well. It's getting more common here.
<Bronysith> Lil_B: whenever you download valve games. they update the awesomeness
<Saturn> 08,01i love how new words can come from surprising places
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, linguistics can be fun. My best friend is getting his Master's in it
<Lil_B> Bronysith but I don't have Half live our counter strike installed? how can they be updating?
<FairysHuff> Ghosties Though it seems more likely that the suicide rate will keep climbing among the native americans instead.
<Saturn> 08,01who here knows what i mean when i say "polari"?
<Bronysith> Lil_B: valve is just that awesome. enjoy
<Ghosties> 04I've heard the term, Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<killerpony7733> Saturn: sounds very familiar
<Saturn> 08,01well
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Just humans and their bullshit. If I could I would wipe them out. Start over.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-words-of-wisdom.png
<Saturn> 08,01polari is gay slang used in the 50s and 60s in britain
<Saturn> 08,01because homosexuality was still illegal at this point
<Saturn> 08,01so they had this sort of in-code dialect to tlak about gay stuff
*Sylandest cuddles FairysHuff and nuzzles "I'm sorry that you're mad...you gonna be alright?"
<Saturn> 08,01it's actually where many commonly used words today came from
<Bronysith> im going to get some bacon jalapeno cheese bread./ brb
<Ghosties> 04But yeah, if overdosing doesn't kill you then the depression will. It's unfortunate but many Native American youths can't identify with their ancestors and heritage, so they turn to gangs to find some sort of identity for themselves.
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Yeh thanks. *Cuddles* I've been angry a lot lately. Don't really know why
<Lil_B> hmmm... Legend of Pegasus is ready for Pre-Ordering on Steam... I have seen Trailers and they looked interesting... must observe
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: You should totally play "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream". I think you'd like it.
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: If you ever need somepony to vent to, I have an ear to listen :)
<FairysHuff> Ghosties Can't say I blame them.
<Ghosties> 04Kammerjunk: FUCK YES
<Saturn> 08,01i'm trying to think of an example
<Bronysith> nvm. my asshole of a dad is up there
<Saturn> 08,01but i actually can't
<Ghosties> 04Great story
<Kammerjunk> Ghosties: I love that game.
<DarkStar> Hey guys, sup?
<Bronysith> Ghosties: hate? let me tell you how much i hate humans
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Thanks ^_^ *Hugs*
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: i love that story
<Bronysith> go to hell DarkStar
*Sylandest hugs FairysHuff back tight :)
<Ghosties> 04HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATE HUMANS.
<DarkStar> Wha?
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Haven't had the chance to read the story yet.
<Bronysith> Ghosties: if you were to write HATE
<Princess_Molestia> You lied about my death, thats low
<Lil_B> good damnit, now I have "Night of Nights" Stuck in my head :(
<DarkStar> .......
<Bronysith> Ghosties: there are over 500 million miles of paper (sorry forgot exact number) in my circutry
<DarkStar> I REGRET NOTHING!!
<Bronysith> Ghosties: if you were to write HATE on every nano strand upon those hundreds of millions of miles of paper with HATE, that would not equal 1 1 billionth of how much i hate humans right now
<Ghosties> 04So much hate~
<Lil_B> Love and Talerate ;)
<FairysHuff> Yah know I often wonder about how to create a new sort of society or rebuild one that was better than our current one. But I'm just one pony, I can't do it alone and I don't have the faith in other ponies to get over their own greed.
<Bronysith> if you havent already. heres the link to that great story http://www.surfturk.com/endoftheworld/ihavenomouth.html
<Kammerjunk> I get the feeling Meanwhile would like AM.
<FairysHuff> Bronysith Right there with you.
<Bronysith> im re reading this story
<FairysHuff> I try not to think about these things as I know theres nothing I can do and I'm ashamed by that.
<Ghosties> 04It's good, I'm a big fan of "I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream"
<Ghosties> 04AM is just the most evilest, vilest, most purest form of hate ever
<Bronysith> Ghosties: id rather have skynet take over than AM any day
<Bronysith> Ghosties: wait? he only feels hate...
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Bronysith> DALEK HE IS A DALEK except more evil
<Ghosties> 04He's sentient but he hates that all he feels is hate
*Bronysith has the realization rage face
<Litwick> ill brb after some breakfast
<Ghosties> 04I wouldn't be surprised if he's jealous of the humans for being able to feel something other than hate
<Lil_B> FairysHuff Since some years I'm wondering how to make a state in which everyone has the same chances, the problem just is that there are way to much people on earth to tread each and everyone correctly and to net let them hate each other...
<Bronysith> Ghosties: dont spoil the rest of the story. havent read it in a while
<Ghosties> 04I won't
<Kammerjunk> So basically, he's a Dalek.
<Jim> ITT hate
<Lil_B> FairysHuff but I think we can agree that it is defenetly possible to make the earth at least a little bit better so it doesn't get worse
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: except worse
<Kammerjunk> Well, yeah.
<FairysHuff> http://youtu.be/TQmz6Rbpnu0
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: You killed the chat :O
<TheKoreanBrony1354> who
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 Needed to be done.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Gentlemen...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I smell chicken
<Bronysith> hey Scoot-Scootaloo mlmg
<Jim> GentleScoot
<Ghosties> 04Mentlegen
<Bronysith> gentledragons
<FairysHuff> Yet even after such a speech nothing changed. Why am I not surprised.
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Human nature in it's best
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 Yup. *Sigh* Makes me sick.
<Sylandest> master Scoot-Scootaloo, welcome
<Kammerjunk> Once a week, we throw a party here in chat. Once a week, BronyState will stream this and that! Ev'ry mod's anew and all anons are mods! That's the way on Penny Pony day!
<Kammerjunk> ...I'm watching the Hunchback from Notre Dame again.
<Sylandest> Kammerjunk: youdontsay.jpg
<Ghosties> 04I dunno what planet you come from, Kammer, but I don't think "Penny Pony Day" is gonna happen on this site :p
<Chrysalis> hai guys
<FairysHuff> btw that video is from 1992
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, me either.
<Jim> ohai Chrysalis
<Kammerjunk> Topsy Turvy just didn't fit.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Well you come from the same country as me :D
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, there are actually other Danish bronies.
<Kammerjunk> What, 2 dozen?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: From what i get we are the only two actual regular danes here
<Kammerjunk> Figures. For all our freedom, this country is so condemning.
<FairysHuff> How many of you would be willing to give up what you have, move to a new area and help build a new society with nothing in return but a place in that new society? I'm serious. I've been thinking about it a lot over the years.
<Kammerjunk> Or maybe that's just society in general.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Depends on the society.
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: If you can make a actual fair and equal society i would do that
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk A society that looks and plans long into the future and not for the immediate personal gain.
<Kammerjunk> Ha ha. Humans treating each other fair.
<sprinkle_GS17> ^
<Ghosties> 04^^
<Ghosties> 04Seriously, ain't gonna happen
<killerpony7733> ^^^
<Ghosties> 04As long as two people with separate opinions exist, it ain't gonna happen
<FairysHuff> If I could just get 10 people together to start such a society it would be something.
<Ghosties> 04You're already asking for too much. Ten? Yeah, there's so much room for disappointment there :/
<killerpony7733> This is why i'm intrigued by the idea Deus ex 1 had and it's not so successful sequel has
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm all for an equal society, but I'm 16.
<sprinkle_GS17> imo its more cuz of egoism. people focus too much on good life, for us life has become about pleasure
<sprinkle_GS17> and that makes people arrogant and self-centered
<Jim> life has become more about ponies
<FairysHuff> Our society is all about what we can get NOW and screw what happens later.
<FairysHuff> I want to change that.
<Jim> Ever sat down, and think to yourself "What has lead to this?"
<FairysHuff> Jim Greed
<RX-78-SweetieBot> <Jim>	life has become more about ponies
<Kammerjunk> Societies today are all "everyone are entitled their own opinions" until two people disagrees.
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: Yeah you should see the current danish goverment everyone is bashing everyone and our prime minister cause ALL want a god damn piece of the pie to make changes to the tax law that's currently in play
<Kammerjunk> Then it becomes a battle on who is most right.
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 Yes. I try so hard not to think about it.
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 Yet it's on my mind constantly. I can't get rid of it
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: darkstar is the same person
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia and darkstar or whoever it is have been trolling me the whole time
<Bronysith> to both of you
<Bronysith> i say go to hell
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: But hey, the Danish government is not all bad. I've had many fits of laughter from Villy Søvndal.
<Dovah> why do cats have such sharp clwas? theyre painful:S
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: Because they love to sink them into soft human flesh when you just want to pet them.
<sprinkle_GS17> Dovah: better than dogs with jaws that can kil lyou
<FairysHuff> But I am serious about starting a new society. I'm not arrogant or foolish enough to believe that I could lead it. Is it so wrong to want change that your willing to do it yourself no matter how bad you may think you'll be at it?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Not all bad sure, It's just how stupid and idiotic everyone is our goverment was made on a steady idea of being friends despite different ideals even within the current ruling goverments body
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: you cant do it without finding another planet or creating a revolution on this one
<Kammerjunk> Oh, what hath mankind wrought?
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 Or buying a small plot of land to start with.
<FairysHuff> "only the dead have seen the end of war" plato
<FairysHuff> "If you are young and not liberal, then you have no heart; but if you are old and not conservative, then you have no brain" winston churchill
<FairysHuff> "I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its stupidity" Dwight D. Eisenhower
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: wont work for long, that tiny little microcommunity will be dependant on the world around it
<Dovah> wait FairysHuff is planning on starting a revelution and starting a new country/sociaty? awesome I wanna help!
<sprinkle_GS17> revelution...cant tell if wrong spelling or awesome new word
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 True, which is why I am scared to trust others to help. Some will have goo intentions while others will want to twist it to their own ends.
<Dovah> sprinkle_GS17: thats ok niether can i
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Actually, it's possible to buy your own island.
<Kammerjunk> Costs a metric ton of cash, though.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Yes. If you have millions.
<Kammerjunk> ...It's also possible to buy an abandoned nuclear silo.
<Kammerjunk> And live there.
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: i meant more along the lines of food n stuff being shipped from the mainland, the microcommunity will still be completely controled by the other countries
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk I looked into that last year
<XAX> and back.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Too much money
<Kammerjunk> Quite.
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 Such things take time to establish unless you intend to start a war.
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: time wont even help, youll still have either a very small amount of people, or a tiny microcommunity which will require materials from the mainland
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: and by small amount of people i mean like 10-20 max
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 Not if it's done right. It would mean sacrificing much of our modern luxuries.
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 Like medicine.
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: lolwut.
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: medicine is hardly a luxury
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: without medicine your island will just die and thatll be that
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 I'm serious. Many third world children would argue otherwise. As would millions of Americans.
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of medicine, are there any actual good arguments against health care in the US?
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: im not american or a third-world child, and i refuse to consider medicine a luxury. i would be dead if not for medicine.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Apparently it's socialist and therefore evil according to the republicans.
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 As would I. But thats your view. Not mine.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Well, anything is socialist if you look deep enough.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Tell that to the american right
<Kammerjunk> Silly republicans.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk You'd be charged with treason ^_^
<Kammerjunk> Mea maxima culpa.
<sprinkle_GS17> i can barely see twi there
<MadSurge> Come on guys, stop with the cynism! One can dream right?
<FairysHuff> MadSurge Not in this day and age
<sprinkle_GS17> i liked Nagatos(Pain) views on life
<PonyNegZero> thoughtpolice says no!
<derpy_pony> hi bronies! :)
<Bronysith> AM will be all the madder for that. It makes me a little happier. And yet … AM has won, simply … he has taken his revenge …I have no mouth. And I must scream.
<FairysHuff> Hope is the equivalent of sticking your head in the sand these days.
<sprinkle_GS17> hoi derpy_pony
<MegaMoonShine> hi derpy_pony :)
<MadSurge> derpy_pony: RUN AWAY, CYNISM TOOK OVER
<derpy_pony> is this live?
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of Latin, I'm starting to get the feeling governments are doing malum gratia malis.
<Kandarihu> That image, dawww
<derpy_pony> I invented cynism, MadSurge
<TheKoreanBrony1354> adorable
<FairysHuff> Cynicism today is just Realism.
<Kammerjunk> The two aren't mutually inclusive, though.
<sprinkle_GS17> ^
<derpy_pony> cynism just means desillusionment
<derpy_pony> can be healthy from time to time
<derpy_pony> but...life goes on, new things happen
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled.png
<Kammerjunk> derpy_pony: The show must go on.
<derpy_pony> and it's awesome :D
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Until the curtain comes down
<Kammerjunk> Speaking of nothing relating to anything we've talked about today, I am surprised at how tired I'm not.
*Jim Freddie Mercury stance
<sprinkle_GS17> mfw when im in a good mood for once and suddenly everyone around me is cynical. is it opposite day or someth
<FairysHuff> Whos streaming btw? VioletVanilla?
<Kammerjunk> sprinkle_GS17: I'm never in a bad mood!
<Kammerjunk> Oh hey, Daft Punk.
<Kammerjunk> Digital Love?
<sprinkle_GS17> Kammerjunk: im always in a bad mood...except today
<derpy_pony> being in a bad mood is boring
<FairysHuff> sprinkle_GS17 Nah. I'm always like this. I just don't voice it much cause people get angry when faced with the truth.
<Kammerjunk> Or maybe Something About Us.
<sprinkle_GS17> Kammerjunk: cause Roger won Wimbledon yay
<Kammerjunk> I always mix the two together.
<Kammerjunk> sprinkle_GS17: ...Pardon?
<MadSurge> derpy_pony: Ikr, you can be cynical, but not all the time!
<sprinkle_GS17> Kammerjunk: nevermind, its tennis :3
<TheKoreanBrony1354> funky
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-condescending-brony-wonka.jpg
<derpy_pony> also, making long term plans or societal analysis in bad mood always fails
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-my-little-mass-effect1.jpg
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I'm fairly certain this is Digital Love.
<Kammerjunk> Except it's not.
<Flyboy> hi guys!
<derpy_pony> hi Flyboy :)
<Kammerjunk> It's totally Something About Us.
<Jim> hi Flyboy
<Flyboy> who's as
<MegaMoonShine> hi Flyboy :)
<Flyboy> who'se streaming*
<FairysHuff> I take it that it's VioletVanilla streaming?
<Kammerjunk> The Discovery version, I'd wager.
<derpy_pony> sounds like vivi, yes
<Kammerjunk> And not that Musqiue Volume whatever piffle.
<Flyboy> yeah, i thought it might be vi
<FairysHuff> Well VioletVanilla if your the one streaming thanks for choosing this soft music. I feel a little better. ^_^
<Kammerjunk> This track is so relaxing.
<PonyNegZero> I can actually focus on writing code with this music... this is unacceptable!
<Kammerjunk> I'm just sliding out of this chair.
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Yup.
<Kammerjunk> I usually listen to Too Long when I'm mining, though.
<FairysHuff> What time would it be where Vi is anyway?
<derpy_pony> I'd love to see the tracklist somewhere on the site
<Kammerjunk> Now there's a good Daft Punk number.
<derpy_pony> 16:51, FairysHuff
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-new-fluttershy-in-a-nutshell.png
<FairysHuff> derpy_pony Ah just 1 hour ahead of me then
<Kammerjunk> Consarnit, Vivi, you're reminding me how tired I am.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: UK?
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Yes
<Kammerjunk> Right-o.
<PonyNegZero> If it wasn't for this liquid energy sitting next to me, I'd be asleep...
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-as-celestia-is-my-witness.png
<FairysHuff> PonyNegZero Huh?
<Kammerjunk> I think I read a fanfic or three centered around this Spike growing up thing once.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-cut-in-line-ill-take-whats-mine1.png
<EggWhite|TERA> Heya everypony!
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: there is a can of magic sitting next to me...
<Jim> hi EggWhite|TERA
<sprinkle_GS17> owaw, apparently Bear Grylls follows tennis.
<FairysHuff> PonyNegZero Aaah. That never helps me ^_^
<Sylandest> this is good music to eat breakfast to :)
<MegaMoonShine> Heya EggWhite|TERA :)
<sprinkle_GS17> woot Roger Federer
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: believe me, I'm already tired... I have hours of work still, a big dinner, and then a ranked TF2 match tonight...
<Kammerjunk> EggWhite|TERA: TERA - Now there's an interesting game I never got into.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-silly-person.jpg
<Kammerjunk> >2012
<Kammerjunk> >Trolling bronies
<FairysHuff> PonyNegZero Maybe you should switch to the Espresso's.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-portal-pie.jpg
<Kammerjunk> PonyNegZero: You know what you need? A Dolce Gusto machine.
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: well, they took the keurig machine to the training room...
<Kammerjunk> Dolce Gusto machines make such good coffees.
<FairysHuff> PonyNegZero Once again - Huh? ^_^
<sprinkle_GS17> Bronysith: does naht compute
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: I know... I hope this isn't a weeklong training thing again...
<EggWhite|TERA> Kammerjunk: Tis a fun game, a bit too easy to level up on but the combat is good
<Kammerjunk> I concur,.
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-that-awesome-moment.png
*FairysHuff Sudden power slide into the alley of different topics.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: ever tried italian coffe?
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: What, like cappucino?
<FairysHuff> Anyone have any recommendations of Android Apps?
<Kammerjunk> PonyNegZero: Actually, I have an idea. You know those energy drinks you can get in shot size?
<Kammerjunk> Take 8.
<Jim> just think of something, there's an app for that
<PonyNegZero> Kammerjunk: my job doesn't provide those...
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk And then he can watch his heart explode
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: yep, the kind that fits in a small cup but is really concentrated
<Kammerjunk> PonyNegZero: Neither did my school. Didn't stop my from rocking in my chair all day.
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: explode twice
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Oh yeah, I know those. My dad drinks them every morning before work. I'm not in such a rush, though.
<PonyNegZero> Kammerjunk: I do have this starbucks refresher thing...
<MadSurge> I don't really like energy drinks, it's like drinking bubblegum :s
<EggWhite|TERA> Brb everypony I'm going to try something on my PC and it may disconnect my IRC
<Kammerjunk> Actually, in retrospect, 8 energy drink shots was probably a bad idea.
<FairysHuff> I like Hazelnut Lattes myself. Don't have them often though. Makes my heart tremble.
<PonyNegZero> I just derailed the whole conversation... score 1 for me
<Kammerjunk> In the I-can't-sit-still-right-now-for-god's-sake-help kind of way.
<MadSurge> I've been in Starbucks in Madrid, but all I bought was chocolate muffins :D
<PonyNegZero> Kammerjunk: for-celestia's-sake
<mitamaking> Hello everyzebra
<MegaMoonShine> lol MadSurge
<PonyNegZero> I visited the first starbucks in Seattle
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: I have a nice cup of mocha at least once a day. Had 3 today to keep me awake.
<FairysHuff> Anyone else still pissed off at their parents answer to everything as a child being "Cause I said so"
<MegaMoonShine> Hello mitamaking :)
<mitamaking> FairysHuff: I never did get over that
<Jim> FairysHuff, No
<MegaMoonShine> FairysHuff: :[
<FairysHuff> mitamaking Jim Your lucky then.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Right now I'm questoning if doing the Radio Tower Team Rocket segment with a level 48 typhloshion is overkill
<FairysHuff> I got that evertime I asked something.
<MadSurge> MegaMoonShine: mind you, I've been there more than 3 years ago :D so no ponies involved, just chocolate craving :D
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Nope. My parents didn't do that. Instead, my dad tried to explain it to me in baby words, and I always ended up misunderstanding it.
<mitamaking> Wait I said I was and Jim said he didn't
<Hrafn> hi everyone :3
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk Well at least your parents tried.
<Jim> hi Hrafn
<Kammerjunk> Hrafn: Salve!
<mitamaking> New Trixie vs. and The Wotch this morning, yay
<MegaMoonShine> hi Hrafn :)
<FairysHuff> Maybe I should buy a coffee machine to make myself HazelNut lattes.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Yeah, good intentions and everything, but one particular episode made me terrified of the washing machine because I thought the little holes could suck my skin through them.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> o_o
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk hehe thats cute ^_^
<Kammerjunk> No, it was terrifying D:
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Also, yeah, you should totally get a Dolce Gusto machine. It also makes chococcinos!
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk There is a concrete and steel bridge spanning a small river where I live and as a child I used to believe that Trolls lived under it because of the old nursery rhyme. I used to run across it ^_^
<Kammerjunk> And really bad tea.
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Oh, childhood imagination.
<Kammerjunk> You so silly.
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: did you zoidberg woop woop woop across it?
<MegaMoonShine> FairysHuff: Awwww :)
<FairysHuff> PonyNegZero No. I just closed my eyes and ran as hard as I could till I reached the otherside ^_^
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: don't trip~
<TheDoctor> cupcakes
<Kammerjunk> I'm just going to go downstairs, for I fear I'll burst from all this caffeine.
<MirrorImage> ...wait, what song is this?
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: lucky me, my parents always treated me like a thinking being and tried to explain me everything without too much babytalk
<MegaMoonShine> God, this music!
<MegaMoonShine> It's so chill...
<MegaMoonShine> Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
<FairysHuff> PonyNegZero I obviously don't do it anymore. ^_^ Though a bully did almost throw me off that bridge once as a child. I would have died had he succeeded.
<TheDoctor> dat music
<PonyNegZero> FairysHuff: Don't die, dying is bad
<MadSurge> FairysHuff: and he would be in a madhouse
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: a bully almost choked me to death once. thankfully i had a friend with me and i was able to tell him to call our parents who were close
<sprinkle_GS17> FairysHuff: i think i was like 7-8 at the time
<FairysHuff> *Nods* I hate bullies with a passion.
<MirrorImage> sprinkle_GS17 - that's not bullying, that's assault
<MirrorImage> why can't schools recognize the difference?
<MirrorImage> THAT'S the real problem with bullying
<Hrafn> bullies are horrible ._.
<sprinkle_GS17> MirrorImage: well its probably my english, not my native language. he wasnt a school bully, he was some teen on a playground
<PonyNegZero> and that is why I was taught some self defence in TKD...
<EggWhite> Testing testing 1 2 3
<FairysHuff> If I could go back in time and re-live my life, I'd start by breaking the limbs of every bully I come across
<Hrafn> and yeah, I agree, a lot of things that kids do to other kids tends to be written off as "bullying", but if an adult were to do the same thing, it would be a serious crime
<killerpony7733> Well being bullied almost most of your school life really takes a toll on you
<TheDoctor> same
<MirrorImage> wasn't saying you used the wrong word - i meant society has been using the wrong word
<EggWhite> Ok all is good...Ignore me
<MirrorImage> "Oh, they're just kids in school. He's a big bully"
<MirrorImage> versus "Oh, he just tried to kill that kid"
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 I've been there.
<Kammerjunk> Alright, so I was obviously not jacked enough, so I made another cup of coffee.
<TheDoctor> makes you.......a little..........CrAZy........
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - cup? make the whole pot
<PonyNegZero> Kammerjunk: you wouldn't believe what I'd do for a chai latte right now...
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: Oh no, doesn't work like that. I pop in capsules and it makes me a cup.
<Jim> I know someone who was bullied as a child. Now he's 50-something years and is the nicest person I know
<killerpony7733> FairysHuff: So have i, I still very much carry the scar's of it
<Kammerjunk> PonyNegZero: I think I have a few capsules with that. Not really my cup of tea.
<MirrorImage> you talking those Keurig things?
<Kammerjunk> You see what I did there.
<JRP2234[Web]> yayayay
<PonyNegZero> Kammerjunk: well, if I had a keurig machine... -glares down hallway...-
<FairysHuff> killerpony7733 As do I. *Cuddles* ~_~ It's not something you just get over.
<JRP2234[Web]> i has new songy
<MirrorImage> and here's the best part of working where i do...
<TheDoctor> these songs man make u think
<MirrorImage> free coffee and soda all day long
<MirrorImage> course, i ignore the coffee and go straight for the Pepsi Max
<Hrafn> free is my favourite flavour :3
<TheDoctor> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<EggWhite> So far in school I have yet to be bullied, but that is probably because I completly withdraw myself from anyone in school, there is only one person I will talk to there, I refuse to talk to anyone else.
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony! :)
<Jim> hai RaveBrony
<TheDoctor> i made u a pie
<AttacktheAndalite> Morning, RaveBrony
<PonyNegZero> MirrorImage: same for me, but it also includes red bulls, BOTTLES or root beer, and other stuff
<EggWhite> Yellop RaveBrony
<MirrorImage> hmmm... we don't get red bull
<Hrafn> I had a few bullies in school, but I also had close friends
<Jim> Best part of working here, free breakfast, lunch, dinner
<Kammerjunk> EggWhite: I used to be bullied. Then I just kinda stopped caring, and bullying halted in its wake.
<TheDoctor> soup
<FairysHuff> EggWhite I tried that in HighSchool. Still got bullied badly
*RaveBrony waves to Jim, AttacktheAndalite, and EggWhite! :)
<MirrorImage> but my coworker keeps a 12-pack in his overdesk shelf at any given point
<RaveBrony> Who is streaming? :o
<MirrorImage> if i was feeling desperate for one, i'd know exactly where to find them
<Kammerjunk> Okay, so should I buy a wireless headset so I can listen to music while making tea, or should I just spend money on actually BUYING Skyrim and then having extra dosh for Steam Summer Sale?
<PonyNegZero> I gave 0 bucks in high school... I made myself such a target and just brushed off everything
<Ryunosuke> well shit
<Ryunosuke> Tranq is rebooting
<Kammerjunk> PonyNegZero: That's kind of what I do. The way I see it, if I'm able to make fun of myself for my own shortcomings, why should I care if others do so?
<FairysHuff> Something to note, bullying doesnt end once you leave school. >_>
<Bronysith> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-my-faith-in-humanity-not-pretty.png
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - and that's the perfect reason why Bronies are so "meh" about trolls
<MirrorImage> my high school life would've been so much better if i had become a brony 8 years ago
<Kammerjunk> FairysHuff: Please punch me in the gut if I'm using this incorrectly, but man's inhumanity to man.
<pony_5157> Actually, bullying kind of stopped at my end when I left high school
<Jim> MirrorImage, With G3,6? yeah, good luck with that
<TheDoctor> im go to love and tolorate the buck out of u
<MirrorImage> Jim - the modern definition of "brony" i mean
<MirrorImage> 8 years ago, i was still rolling my eyes at MLP toys
<Jim> ^
<FairysHuff> Kammerjunk I have no idea if thats right or not. Doesn't sound wrong though.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Jim> Hi Everlasting_Joy
<Hrafn> hi there
<MegaMoonShine> Howdy Everlasting_Joy :)
<MirrorImage> FairysHuff - punch him anyways
<Flyboy> Hi Evarlasting_Joy!
<FairysHuff> MirrorImage I'll let you do it.
<EggWhite> I don't think people would find my much of a target, I don't ever change my facial expression, I never say anything and if someone attempts to bully me all they get is an emotionless stare, that and the only person I do talk to is about 6' 7" and not many people are willing to mess with him.
*MirrorImage cracks knuckles and glares menancingling
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey Jim, Hrafn, MegaMoonShine, and Flyboy!
<MadSurge> True story, I watched some G1 out of boredom when I was 7-8, didn't think it was that bad o__o
<Everlasting_Joy> MadSurge: Nothing wrong with that.
<Bronysith> OMG NO FUCKING WAY http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-cranky-captain-ginyu.jpg
<Jim> oooh, that made me think of something. A few years back, I was at a friends house. His little sister had a huuge collection of MLP toys and figurines. I thought it was the worst waste of money ever
<MirrorImage> MadSurge - i think that's half the reason a not-insignificant number of us "liked" Sailor Moon back in the 90s
<Jim> Nowadays I'd be ALL over that
<MadSurge> MirrorImage: but I DID like Sailor Moon :D
<MirrorImage> as did i
<MirrorImage> but REALLY think about it
<Hrafn> I liked watching G1 with my cousin when I was little :P
<Hrafn> but I doubt I'd enjoy it today
<Everlasting_Joy> I'll be right back.
<MadSurge> Never cared about "girly" labels, the sailors kicked some serious ass :D
<Jim> G1 is not bad at all actually
<pony_5157> The only thing "girly" that I really liked was the Powerpuff Girls when I was a kid
<Flyboy> Jim: g1 wasnt that bad, but then there was g3 'shiver'
<Kammerjunk> Jim: I was spending a week out of town because silly pipe leaks, and I used the room of the 8-ish daughter of my mum's friend. She had an MLP toy.
<Insane> Am I the only one that didn't have a tv when they were a kid and would run to a friends house just to watch baby looney tunes?
<Kammerjunk> ...It was Nightmare Fuel Pinkie Pie.
<MirrorImage> MadSurge - "Do you beliee-ve in the power of love?"
<MadSurge> Jim: only g3 was unsavageable :D
<Jim> Indeed it was ^
<Hrafn> I might give G1 another chance sometime
<Insane> I love baby looney tunes!
<Insane> SO CUTE
<EggWhite> I've still yet to watch Sailor Moon, I mean I have watched atleast 700 hours of anime, yet not a single episode of Sailor Moon...I'll get round to it one day
<Flyboy> G1 was supposed to be wuite good. atleast it had a sense of adventure in it.
<MadSurge> MirrorImage: In the name of the moon, I will punish you! :D
<pony_5157> G1-G2, from what I've heard, it's okay. Now G3, that's the one you should worry about lol
<Sallymeow1> hiya everypony :)
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm back.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sallymeow1.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: hey man
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, nightmare fuel Pinkie Pie is terrifying.
<Hrafn> what little I've seen of G3 has given me permanent brain damage
<TheDoctor> the doctor is in

<Jim> Duck Tales was probably the most memorable from my childhood
<pony_5157> "What happened to the good shows?"? It really depends on what your taste is. I found some shows passable, but didn't watch. MLP:FiM was the first that I loved
<Flyboy> MadSurge: then you sir, are a god
<Bronysith> The show has gained a COLT following
<MirrorImage> Jim - Woo oo
<jammerKunk> Yay netsplits?
<MadSurge> Flyboy: no, just insane to begin with :D
