<NewDCD> 9he has one that looks like AJ
<NewDCD> 9one that looks like Rarity
<NewDCD> 9and one that looks like Pinkie : 3
<Ghosties> 4But Taokaka's totally amazing
<Rurik> I wonder who Kamina's favourite pony is.
*prince-dari should be working this weekend, it's 5AM. DX
<drf|laptop> 03:<
<Ghosties> 4Her story is like the only one that isn't serious
<Hippie-Pie> winning.
<Damos> good night everyone
<NewDCD> 9she wants you to give her food, good guy
<GabeMoist> I don't usually play BlazBlue, But when I do, I prefer REAL SOVIET DAMAGE
<Ghosties> 4I know, that's why she's awesome
<Derpyderp> I missed the stream by like 5 hours -.-
<Rurik> So Taokaka is Lyra?
<NewDCD> 9You prefer GIGANTIC TAGER don't you?
<MeteorVenture> kamina's favorite is pinkamina naturally
<Ghosties> 4Rurik, probably
<Ghosties> 4Tager
<Ghosties> 4IRON PISS
<GabeMoist> That's who I usually use
<Rurik> Oh god, PinKAMINA! Somepony needs to draw that, right now!
<NewDCD> 9talking bout Pinkamina

<Charles> good night everyone, hope you enjoy Aladdin next week

<SkaianBrony> Good night pony
<Charles> http://www.blogcdn.com/www.urlesque.com/media/2010/06/backpain-1277406949.jpg
<Rurik> Isn't there a scene from early versions of Aladdin that was later cut? Or am I thinking of another Disney movie?
<NewDCD> 9it was a song
<NewDCD> 9it was censored
<NewDCD> 9not in the original theatrical release
<NewDCD> 9but on home video releases
<Rurik> I don't suppose we'll be getting the uncut version?
<NewDCD> 9dunno
<NewDCD> 9the change is really minor
<SkaianBrony> Real quick, what kind of movie is Starship Troopers?
<kir13> i got to work next week... :s...
<SkaianBrony> Comedy?
<Rurik> Part of me now wants to write a Pony Lagann fic, but I don't know if I'm manly enough to combine the two manliest things ever.
<Rurik> It's a parody of old army recruitment propaganda.
<Ghosties> 4Starship Troopers is a sci fi film
<Rurik> Damn, too bad the twenty-first doesn't fall on a Friday this year.

<Deathsquad> so what movie are we on, my internet sucks
<Rurik> We could do a special Summer Sun Celebration marathon or something if it did.
<kir13> why?
<SkaianBrony> So we do it anyway!
<SirSprinkles> 6We may do an end of summer thing. MAY.
<SkaianBrony> May? May was last month
<SirSprinkles> 6Not in May. >>;
<SkaianBrony> :3
<SirSprinkles> 6And now I wait for him to figure out how to rejoin.
<Rurik> Hrm, actually, maybe I'll look up how to stream later, we can celebrate the Summer Solstice that the Summer Sun Celebration is based on with a marathon of the entire first season.

<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Just you wait until I can kick you back, Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6Just you wait.
<Rurik> Two there must always be, one to possess the power, and the other to crave it.
<SkaianBrony> IRL friend :3 he told me about this magical place where all your dreams come true and you never have to worry about anything
<SkaianBrony> And when I told him I wouldn't go to Vegas with him, he told me to come here
<SirSprinkles> 6Except posting in color if your not a mod.
<Rurik> Jersey?
<SirSprinkles> 6That you have to worry about.
<Ghosties> 4LOL Sprinkles is trying to threaten me XD

<prince-dari> Lol Alestorm.
<SkaianBrony> YAR HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
<SirSprinkles> 6The Lazy Town version is ALMOST as good.
<SirSprinkles> 6Only because it comes with a funny dance.
<Mikey> hahahahah that's funny
<Rurik> I listened to the cake song from that show while reading Cupcakes once, I nearly died laughing. XD
<eXAKR> So
<Lambda> haha, the eyes are perfect
<eXAKR> I'm listening to The Residents
<Stormy> I don't remember that pony
<Rurik> I'm a horrible human being, aren't I?
<eXAKR> while reading up on MLP: FiM
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Lambda> I bet celestia's cutie mark is actually the troll face
<eXAKR> I'm officially crazy
<Lambda> and she just has a sticker covering it up
<SkaianBrony> No no, HORSES are terrible people
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5xEUwhNfQ
<prince-dari> Cupcakes.
<SkaianBrony> ...but then ponies...
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly would like to read Cupcakes, but I first need to acquire it, which I cannot do on this wifi.
<SkaianBrony> I would get it for you, however I care about you too much
<Ghosties> 4Cupcakes...
<Ghosties> 4Ugh
<SkaianBrony> and I don't want that on my computer
<Ghosties> 4It was hard for me to get through
<prince-dari> Cupcakes is so funny.
<Ghosties> 4It was so badly written
<Rurik> Mmm, taste the Rainbow Dash.
<prince-dari> Or hsould I say - punny.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not that bad, apparently, I'd just end up laughing at the grammar.
<Stormy> woah
<SkaianBrony> I mean I could handle Angel Blade or something like that
<prince-dari> Ghosties: Did you read the V2 version?
<Stormy> I never noticed that
<SkaianBrony> but Cupcakes...
<Stormy> that's kind of crazy
<prince-dari> The one I read had perfect grammar and spelling.
<Lambda> woah
<Lambda> me neither
<SirSprinkles> 6Not as good as Kaiba's destiny.
<Lambda> that's even better than the Shrel is a Brony video
<SirSprinkles> 6I haven't even started the video and I can say that.
<Lambda> *Shrek
<Rurik> I should try experimenting with a recipe to simulate the cupcakes from that story, seems simple enough, some assorted food dyes to make it appear rainbow coloured and a bit of hot sauce since rainbows are spicy.
<Mikey> lol /what/
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyC2ccF_-Pc
<prince-dari> Top comment on this video.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Mikey> oohhh yeah I've seen that
<SirSprinkles> 6This can only end well.
<Mikey> but I've never seen the last movie so
<Ghosties> 4@dari: No, I didn't. I remember reading that there was an "alternate" ending where LOLSPOILERSIMNOTTELLING
<Lambda> me neither
<Rurik> Pinkie would certainly approve of cupcakes with hot sauce.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Stormy> I don't think I want to see the last movie
<Stormy> the third one was barely memorable
<Mikey> omg I know
<Lambda> hahaha, I don't need to see the last two
<Rurik> I'm hungry now, I could go for some hotwings...
<Mikey> all I can remember from the 3rd is that puss had like 8 mil girlfriends
<Mikey> and that's it
<MeteorVenture> i still need to eat a cupcake with hot sauce on it
<prince-dari> I think I saw the 3rd one on in flight entertainment.
<prince-dari> All I remember is someone smashes a wall down with their head.
<Mikey> XDDD
<SirSprinkles> 6I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why it sounds like there is a live band two feet away from me when there is nopony here, and no audio/video devices to be seen...
<SkaianBrony> The music is in you
<SilverSonic> RAY
<SilverSonic> 8D
<Ray> 02Rawr~
<Rurik> Maybe Pinkie Pie finally broke free of the 4th wall and has taken refuge inside your mind.
<SkaianBrony> Go now, and chase your dreams...
<SilverSonic> any requests for my show?
<SkaianBrony> Of chinese food...
<SilverSonic> inb4 Golden sun request ;D
<SirSprinkles> 6But I've been listening to Avast Fluttershy's Ass all day. Not anything Pinkie Pie related.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I have chips.
<Ray> 02Actualy I have 2 requests xD
<SirSprinkles> 6This is my second bag. In two days.
<SilverSonic> PM THEM :D
<SirSprinkles> 6NOT. HEALTHY.
<Ray> 02:DDD
<Ray> 02But one is a remix, is everything ok with that?
<Rurik> Pft, I eat worse than that on a daily basis.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm broke.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's all I can afford, really.
<SirSprinkles> 6Otherwise I probably would eat worse.
<SirSprinkles> 6I used to just eat tons of McDonalds for no reason other than I was passing the place.
<SilverSonic> sure depends on what the remix is ;x
<SkaianBrony> There are dumplings here
<Rurik> Ew, even I won't eat THAT crap, and I've eaten a rubber hamburger on a bet.
<SirSprinkles> 6Can't come over.
<SkaianBrony> hot sweet sexy dumplings
<SirSprinkles> 6Have to leave at BUMFUCK in the morning to go to Hershey.

<SkaianBrony> I enjoy teasing you
<SkaianBrony> :3
<Lambda> that clown pony almost looks more like a dog than a pony
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm aware. >>;
<Rurik> Is it wrong that I'm now shipping Sprinkles and Skaian in my mind?
<SirSprinkles> 6...
<SirSprinkles> 6You are not the only one.
<SkaianBrony> No
<SirSprinkles> 6You're really not.
<Lambda> 0:44 is a better time to see it I think
<SkaianBrony> But it's never going to happen
<SirSprinkles> 6EVERYPONY we know does.
<Mikey> XD no I saw
<SkaianBrony> All of the ponies
<SirSprinkles> 6And no, never going to happen.
<SkaianBrony> ALL OF THEM
*prince-dari thinks he hears a call of "Ferris wheel".
<Stormy> o.o
<Stormy> never noticed that before
<SkaianBrony> 8I
<SirSprinkles> 6I am the ferris wheel.
<SirSprinkles> 6Remember?
<Stormy> kind of creepy
<Stormy> well no, not really
<Rurik> Talking of hot dumplings and bumfuckery probably doesn't help? XD
<prince-dari> The ferris wheel on a ferris wheel.
<SkaianBrony> >.<
<Lambda> all clowns are creepy, even pony ones
<SkaianBrony> Mobius Double Reach-Around
<SirSprinkles> 6We tend to word things worse, Rurik.
<prince-dari> WE NEED TO DEEPER
<Lambda> jk
<Lambda> only some clowns
<Rurik> And that just made it worse. XD
<SkaianBrony> I don't know if I'm comfortable with that
<SirSprinkles> 6Chat just got 20% gayer.
<Ghosties> 4>shipping SprinklesxSkaian
<Ghosties> 4wut
<Rurik> Confound these ponies, they drive me to ship. XD
<Ghosties> 4Lol errybody gay up in 'ere
<Rurik> Seriously, I never shipped before ponies.
<SkaianBrony> My first shipping was digimon XD
<prince-dari> To be honest I'm not actually keen on fanfiction, shipping, etc.
<SirSprinkles> 6I still don't ship. But that's likely because my fave character is Apple Bloom.
<prince-dari> Did you get your Applebloom trip yet?
<Rurik> That doesn't seem to stop the Spikebloom shippers.
<Ghosties> 4SkaianBrony: Digimon, you say?
<SkaianBrony> Honestly if shipping or fanfic can be done WELL, then I'd give it a chance
<BronyTj> i guess the movie night is over
<SirSprinkles> 6SpikeBloom is not a shipping.
<SkaianBrony> Yes. Digi. Mon.
<SirSprinkles> 6It is a mock shipping, if anything.
<SkaianBrony> D digimon
<Ghosties> 4Which season?
<SkaianBrony> I was a fan of 1 and 3
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<Rurik> I actually liked season 4. (Flame shield activated.)
<Chistery> Anyone?
<SkaianBrony> No opinion on 2, and...I do believe there was no Fourth Season
<Chistery> Oh, quite a few "someones."
<Ghosties> 4There was a fourth season
<Ghosties> 4I loved season 2
<SkaianBrony> No, I don't believe so
<Chistery> Neat.
<Ghosties> 4It was my favorite season
<SirSprinkles> 6I am currently RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGEing that even though I have the most points in the GETters list, I still have to battle KoG for 1st, whereas any other place can be taken without battle.
<SkaianBrony> (Refuses to acknowledge season 4)
<prince-dari> Are these official?
<Ghosties> 4I wish I couldn't acknowledge Season 3, but that's just me
<Rurik> I don't get the hate for season 4, come on, who wouldn't want to be able to transform into a badass guy who shoots fire from his fists?
<SirSprinkles> 6WHY WOULD YOU POST THOSE KNOWING I HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY THEM WITH?
<Ghosties> 4Was there ANY character development in Season 4?
<prince-dari> SirSprinkles: I have money to buy them with. (:
<SirSprinkles> 6>>;
<prince-dari> TROLOLOLOLOLOL
<SirSprinkles> 6Well excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse meeeeeeeeeeeeeee princess.
<SkaianBrony> There weren't any companion digimon. I was disappoint
<Rurik> Character what now? I watch ponies for the plot, I watch Digimon for the badass monsters kicking the shit out of eachother.
<prince-dari> Official pony shirts.
<prince-dari> DO WANT
<Ghosties> 4I watched Digimon for the plot
<SkaianBrony> 3rd Season was much better in japanese
<SirSprinkles> 6>plot
<Ghosties> 4Dead serious
<kir13> were do u get those t shirts!!?
<SkaianBrony> XD awesome man
<prince-dari> Rainbow Dash shirts. :o
<SkaianBrony> I watched for the monsters
<Lambda> whaaat
<SkaianBrony> Only show I watch for plot is Lucky Star
<Stormy> o__o
<Ghosties> 4I was more interested in the human characters than the digimon
<Mikey> oh yeah
<Stormy> I need that Spike one
<Lambda> why does the Spike one say "Epic cute"
<SirSprinkles> 6LUCKY STAR
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Mikey> I like a few of those, mostly ones without the dumb writing
<Rurik> Lucky Star had a plot? XD
<Lambda> I like it too
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Lambda> not sure about the caption though
<Rurik> Or do you mean the "plot."
<Mikey> the rarity DEAL WITH IT and born this way is awesome though
<SirSprinkles> 6Likely the "plot"
<Stormy> well yeah, they'd all be better without the captions
<SkaianBrony> Yes. That. ><
<SirSprinkles> 6As that's one of the mane reasons to watch it.
<prince-dari> I saw Rarity DEAL WITH IT wearing sunglasses and I died.
<prince-dari> That was too good.
<Rurik> Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more, say no more.
<SirSprinkles> 6I... can't stop making pony puns.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles!
<prince-dari> Also Rarity with implied "BITCH, I am flawless". XD
<SirSprinkles> 6My head is full of pony.
<SirSprinkles> 6What?
<Ghosties> 4Cloping to the "plot" of Lucky Star *glares*
<Ghosties> 4That's disgusting, sir
<SirSprinkles> 6I never said I did.
<Lambda> hate to break it to you dari, but I bet these are only in women's/girl's
<Rurik> They're far to skinny to clop to anyway.
<Ghosties> 4"Likely the 'plot'"
<SkaianBrony> Twas I that trolled that
<prince-dari> They're making them in men's sizes sometime I think.
<SkaianBrony> Never actually seen it, though I don't find myself caring too much
<Lambda> "Adorbs"
<prince-dari> I <3 Rainbow Dash shirt is best shirt.
<Lambda> xD
<Rurik> It's actually a very funny show, at least for otaku.
<SirSprinkles> 6I've watched and read all of Lucky Star. Honestly like the story of it and the characters. It's funny and interesting, and really makes you think sometimes.
<SirSprinkles> 6I will never know which end is the head of a chocolate coronet.
<Lambda> I think the "simply awesome" one is the best
<SkaianBrony> 0_0
<Rurik> Woah, that's a big butt, and a layered belly.
<Stormy> I just looked at the first link
<Ghosties> 4Bah, I really don't care if you clop or not *shrugs* I just assumed they were all chibi girls until I searched Lucky Star on google
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo Rurik
<Stormy> Rarity "Deal with it" is definitely the best
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> hahaha
<Lambda> that one is pretty good
<prince-dari> I'd get both the simply awesome one and I <3 Rainbow Dash one.

<SirSprinkles> 6Horrible part is I know who you're talking about...
<SirSprinkles> 6Can't put my finger on a name...
<SkaianBrony> I know someone like that...
<SirSprinkles> 6Really shouldn't ever go more than 36 hours without sleep... Oo
<Rurik> I know, I can only remember the names of the main cast, not the secondary one.
<SkaianBrony> WE have that friend ><
<SirSprinkles> 6We do. >>;
<SirSprinkles> 6We have a lot of stereotypical otaku friends though.
<SirSprinkles> 6With their own weird little quirks.
<SkaianBrony> We have shippers among us
<SirSprinkles> 6We have MALE shippers among us.
<Rurik> Shippers, shippers everywhere!
<SirSprinkles> 6Though they will never admit it to those who don't already know.
<Rurik> I will! :p
<SkaianBrony> The bear thinks I ship
<Ghosties> 4Is the bear's name Harry?
<SirSprinkles> 6I know he does.
<SirSprinkles> 6And no.
<Rurik> It should be.
<Ghosties> 4Aww ._.
<SkaianBrony> Well in the alternate timeline, yes
<Ghosties> 4It really should be Harry
<SkaianBrony> That's his stripper name too
<SirSprinkles> 6The horrible part is that I instantly knew who you were talking about. And that we could probably do that with most of our friends.
<Lambda> well, I've gotta get some sleep
<Lambda> see you guys later
<Mikey> :C
<Mikey> bye
<Rurik> That sounded so incredibly kinky. My head is full of fuck.

<Rurik> If your players survive that you're doing it wrong. :p
<prince-dari> There's a pokemon...Called go lurk?
<SkaianBrony> They also used over 400 gp worth of poisons
<Rurik> It's always amusing as a player when you screw up the DM though.
*eXAKR runs over prince-dari with a bendy bus
<Rurik> I remember one time there was a character who was supposed to get away to screw with us another day.
<Rurik> My tiefling chaos sorcerer scored a critical hit on my attempt to shoot him in the feet and trip him. I vaporised his feet.

<eXAKR> I think I need a nap

<Rurik> But I was the comedy relief, he couldn't bluebolt me. I named him Ash Leejay Williams, and his familiar Raimi the raven.
<Rurik> And yes, I worked in an obligatory "THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!"
<SkaianBrony> ^^ this pleases brony
<SkaianBrony> however bronies need sleep.
<Rurik> In retrospect, he was a lot like Pinkie Pie.
<Rurik> Broke the fourth wall, insane, fond of sweets.

<SirSprinkles> 6It's not my comp.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's my wifi.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm in a cafe.
<SirSprinkles> 6I had to get them to deblock this site.
<SirSprinkles> 6Which they did in like, a day, but still.
<Rurik> A cafe that's open at 2 Am? They must hate your guts. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a cafe in a 24 hour super market.
<SirSprinkles> 6They don't have to do anything for me.
<SirSprinkles> 6In fact, most of the lights are off.
<SirSprinkles> 6They're mopping the floor right now.
<Rurik> Still, if it were me I'd be pissed because I couldn't get away with slacking off. :p
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't care. They can do whatever they want.
<SirSprinkles> 6I had one guy talk to me for like an hour once.
<SirSprinkles> 6And I'm here frequently enough that they know I don't care.
<Rurik> Still bored. Hasbro really needs to get to work on an FiM game. A point and click adventure game, or something like Phoenix Wright.
<Rurik> Or an SRW crossover would be awesome too. XD

<NightSeas> 12I need a new nick name :P
<LightningFlash> Rainbow Dash is best pony. Discuss.
<NightSeas> Can't stand people calling me "NS" anymore
<Rurik> Rainbow Dash? Silly, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie.
<Ascendant> you just highlighted me again .-.
<LightningFlash> Correct. It is not.
<Ascendant> Go ahead
<SirSprinkles> 6Ponified pony that's ponyish and pony like as a pony that ponyly is pony is best ponied pony.
<NightSeas> 12lol
<LightningFlash> I think you missed a pony in there somewhere
<Ascendant> I recall you wanted to use "Silverwind" some time ago
<Ghosties> 4@Rurik: I am most certainly not a pony, sir
<SirSprinkles> 6One... seven... thirty three... nope, that's all of them.
<NightSeas> 12Yeah
<Rurik> Pink pony is best pony, the song says so.
<Ascendant> derp
<NightSeas> 12XD
<LightningFlash> Song fails to realize that Rainbow Dash is best pony
<NightSeas> 12How much have you used that name openly?
<Ascendant> Which name? Silverwind?
<NightSeas> 12Yes
<Ascendant> I've used it like...once.
<Ascendant> Or twice
<Ascendant> never use it anymore
<Ascendant> it's too...happy
<Ascendant> reminds me too much of Starfire
*Ascendant shudders
<LightningFlash> @ ghosties. Lololololol
<Rurik> Anypony else actually heard that song yet? I heard it on Celestia Radio earlier.
<NightSeas> 12I was going to use that name >>
<Ascendant> you can use it if you want
<Ascendant> I honestly don't care
<Ascendant> I've only used it on IRC
<NightSeas> 12I'll think about it
<Ascendant> basically I just stood on the nick for about 5 seconds
<Ascendant> then switched
<LightningFlash> I've been at work all day, everyday, for the last 3 weeks. I've missed anything and everything.
<Ascendant> if you want you can use the nick rainbowponiessuck or something :D
<Ascendant> magicalrainbowponies*
<Rurik> Pink pony is best pony If you disagree, you're wrong She's nuts, she's fun, and she likes to party All night long Pink pony is best pony You all know that it's true I don't care if you like Rainbow Dash And I don't care about you! Because pink pony is best
<NightSeas> 12lmfao
<Rurik> Love that song. <3
<LightningFlash> Pink pony is sad pony. Rainbow Dash is win.
<NightSeas> 12I will use Silverwind if I can’t think up anything better
*Ascendant shrugs
<Ascendant> Is there any particular series/etc. you like?
<Ascendant> like yugioh or something
<NightSeas> 12Hmm, I like Dragon Drive
<LightningFlash> Besides, Rainbow is the only pony cool enough to grow "poison joke" in her basement.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> /nick MagicalRainbow
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02zfc
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02and that's how to fail: IRC edition
<Ascendant> Dragon Drive is what?
<Ascendant> oh
<Ascendant> That's pretty cool
<LightningFlash> Wth. Text is messed up again.
<Ascendant> Pick a name of one of the dragons or something, NightSeas
<Ascendant> Or characters
<NightSeas> 12Sure
<Rurik> And this is why Microsoft is best pony.
<LightningFlash> Curse you Microsoft. Curse you Apple.
*Glacymr gives NightSeas a sandwich
<Glacymr> 12hi
<LightningFlash> I wonder if Apple is owned by applejack's family. That would explain why she is my second least favorite mane 6 pony.
<SirSprinkles> 6Applejack is lowest on my list of mane 6 + CMC, yet out of that list, my favorite is Apple Bloom. XD
<NightSeas> 12Chibi, Air Blast and Kokao are my favorite dragons from the series
*RDMR goes to sleep
<Ascendant> Airblast or Kokao
<Ascendant> or Chibi
<Rurik> AJ is second least best pony, Dash is least best, then from there up it goes Fluttershy, Twilight, Rarity, Flutterage, Pinkamena, Pinkie.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02z-z
<Ascendant> ;p
*Ascendant slaps Ray
*Ray||ZzZzZ snores
<NightSeas> 12Airblast, I think
<LightningFlash> List of favs: rainbow, Twi, pinkie, fluttershy, applejack, rarity.
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<LightningFlash> IMO, if Rarity just didn't show up in season 2, I wouldn't mind.
<LightningFlash> Intact, I might be overjoyed
<LightningFlash> Maybe I could have pinkie throw a party.
<Rurik> I love Rarity, her voice is made of win.
<Rurik> Plus she was in Young Frankenstein.
<LightningFlash> ??
<LightningFlash> She IS Frankenstein.......
<NightSeas> 12Kanopus is awesome too
<Ascendant> if you want
<Rurik> Actually she was his fiance, Gene Wilder was Frankenstein.

<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> Why doesn't the Office 2010 installer provide an option to install either the 32 or 64 bit version straight from the program?
<Ascendant> no idea, I don't use it
<lightumbreon> because it detects the right version
<lightumbreon> 32-64
<eXAKR> Nope
<eXAKR> I'm on 64 bit
<eXAKR> I put the disc in
<eXAKR> It started the 32-bit installer instead
<lightumbreon> check your drive on Explorer, maybe the right installer is there
<eXAKR> I know
<eXAKR> I'm using the 64-bit installer from the CD now
<lightumbreon> i wonder how a 8-bit Windows 7 would look like......
<eXAKR> Whut

<Iskierka> if you're making a list of things that should probably be done, I'd suggest some improvements to things like the quizzes, like only having one hint command :p
<Ascendant> ...lol

<Ascendant> well yeah, I don't have any quizzes atm so derp
<Ascendant> I'm still deciding on everything
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya JL :3
<J-Lugia> heya!
<Nick> hi j
<Iskierka> quizzes like the pokescram one, I mean
<J-Lugia> hi Nick
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> Well, I was going to rescript it to use a timer
<Ascendant> so it only gives 30 seconds to give an answer overall
<Ascendant> and during those 30 seconds it'll print out clues at a few intervals
<Iskierka> that works too
<Ascendant> hint scripts are usually unneeded and annoying
<Ascendant> I prefer that system but it's tedious to script

<Ascendant> script glitch

*Skylands hides
<Ascendant> ;x
<Ascendant> Skylands, I'm just testing lol
<Skylands> 10I know
<Iskierka> script glitch what
<Iskierka> oh blah
<Ascendant> $crlf
<Iskierka> though, it's stopped now ...
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> it's not that
<Iskierka> ?
<Ascendant> I posted the topic loltesting $crlf mode #Silverwings +o Ascendant derp
<Ascendant> [00:57:11] <&Cone> New post: loltesting
<Ascendant> [00:57:11] * Cone sets mode: +o Ascendant
<Iskierka> I see
<eXAKR> You know
<eXAKR> after watching MLP: FiM episode 5
<Iskierka> hrm, can $crlf be removed just with $strip or similar?
<eXAKR> I learned one thing
<Sneas> 03yi-
<eXAKR> Always have your own bottles of ink
<Ascendant> not sure, haven't tried
<eXAKR> In case someone replaces it with vanishing ink
<eXAKR> ohai
<Iskierka> how have you solved it?
<Ascendant> I just block crlf
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Ascendant> because ($crlf isin $1-) doesn't work
<Iskierka> actually I know how to solve it but that brings up another glitch I prevented ...
<Ascendant> I think you should block anything with $something
<Ascendant> because if $crlf works, $ip will too
<Ascendant> and there's a $decode glitch as well, just forgot it
<Iskierka> that might on occasion bring up problems but that could work fine
<eXAKR> what is this
<Iskierka> but instead of blocking, I might see if I can split it so the $ is separate
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> or just get it to use $chr
<Iskierka> that way we can also see people trying to exploit it
<Ascendant> but that's dodgy
<Damos> okay for a minute I understood what you were talking about
<Ascendant> yeah that'd be good
<Damos> wow
<Ascendant> I don't have access so you'll need to PM it to Articuno

<Iskierka> yeah, whenever she reappears
<Ascendant> she probably won't for quite some time as she has work
<Ascendant> I suggest you PM it to her on the forums

<Iskierka> will require some poking around but I might be able to get around that without having to do anything about any $ commands
<eXAKR> Hmmm, delay
<Iskierka> it only checks every 30 seconds or so
<Iskierka> or it should
<Ascendant> jesus it spams
<Ascendant> ah
<Iskierka> only when people talk a lot, could reduce the timer to make it less spammy
<Ascendant> because mIRC parses everything
<eXAKR> Ascendant
<eXAKR> Just kill the script
<Ascendant> I can't

<Articuno> LOL EXPLOIT!
<Articuno> What was it?!
<Ascendant> well
<Articuno> I'm not at home by the way
<Iskierka> the script parses mIRC identifiers like $crlf in the topic's name
<Ascendant> yeah
<Articuno> ovO
<Iskierka> so you could make a toping blah $crlf mode +ao nick
<Iskierka> and it would give nick +ao

<Nick> is anyone seeing the duke nukem forever reviews btw?
<Ascendant> Anyway, I'm going to bed
<Ascendant> almost 2am
<Nick> early reviews I saw last night showed it was bombing critically
<Darkdragon> 3Yeah
<Iskierka> ookay that's a should-be-working forum script uploaded
<Darkdragon> 3Besides, it's been in process for 10 years, but it's not even decent
<Nick> do you have it Dd?
<Darkdragon> 3Yeah.
<Nick> lol so what's wrong with it?
<Iskierka> it's DNF, to get good reviews at this point it would've had to cure cancer or sth
<Ascendant> zzz
<Darkdragon> 3(Well actually my cousin ordered it 10 years ago, and we got some sort of ticket stub)
<Nick> o0 lol they still honoured your reservation after all this time?
<eXAKR> lol Duke Nukem Forever
<Espeon> 06They did say they would
<eXAKR> There were demos at the PC show I went to
<Espeon> 06more like nuke dukem fornever
<Darkdragon> 3Yup
<Iskierka> gamestop said they'd fulfil all reservation
<Iskierka> s
<Nick> wow its only £17 from amazon
<Nick> still...the massive reduced price must say somethign :\
<Darkdragon> 3Yeah
<eXAKR> 14 years of waiting
<eXAKR> for a piece of *****
<Darkdragon> 3Yup. Sucks, doesn't it?
<Ascendant> you have an extra *
<Nick> it has 3 stars max from amazon, all very mixed reviews...I think this all proves originality in modern games, outside of Nintendo, is dead
<Ascendant> okay, but NOW I'M GOING TO BED.
*Ascendant poofs
<Iskierka> it can be spelt with an e on the end too
<Darkdragon> 3Mmm-hmm
<Iskierka> how does it prove originality is dead?
<Nick> the only was I was gonna buy Duke Nukem Forever, you know after lost interest at how long it's taken, is if it got at least over 9.0 average in reviews
<Iskierka> I don't even see how nintendo are being that original either
<Nick> 14 years to make a game which still blows, and we're facing another year of COD/Halo/Fifa/WWE games etc
<Darkdragon> 3Prolly
<Iskierka> solution: don't look at those games, look to the ones which are bothering to be different
<Iskierka> ex. we've already had P2 this year
<Espeon> 06the thing with DNF I think
<Espeon> 06it tried to be "like" old-styled shooters
<Espeon> 06but it did so at the cost of fluidity and things that are quite valued today, as far as I've heard o.o
<Espeon> 06And LOL WWE GAMES
<Nick> although I like COD and always will, I want a campaign COD like the first which was actually over 20 levels, not barely going into double digits
<Espeon> 06Those have changed less than CoD ffs xD
<Iskierka> are those levels actually as long though?
<Nick> people also complaining the fact of how Duke acts, like he belongs in the 90's but that's not really a fair way to review the game
<Espeon> 06the CoD campaigns are often quite neat but too short imo
<Dark_Shadow_Dragon> Hey Icy
<Icy> hey dark
<Nick> as I've said in my topic, modern gaming's main problem (with microsoft and sony at least) is they're always thinking of new ways to charge money for services, what buy the game, buy a online subscription, buy a online pass (if you bought pre-owned)
<Espeon> 06lol yeah online pass
<Espeon> 06certain series seems to have realized what kind of fanbase they generally have
<Espeon> 06as in, not very bright or with eyes for quality :P
<Nick> games like homefront was definitely over-priced. Then as I also said above we're getting the annual influx of unoriginal party/sports/shooter games...I know it won't happen but it just really does remind me of the video game crash in the 80's
<Iskierka> the online pass things is more EA and related
<Nick> yeah but other devs are diving on board with it now; Mortal Kombat (who makes that nowadays?), the people that made Homefront..
<Nick> actually is homefront an ea game again?
<Iskierka> I have no idea, not really paid attention to it
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Iskierka> and the party games are mainly because of kinect, and everyone trying to follow it because they think party games are getting popular now (whether or not they're actually using kinect)
<lightumbreon> hm
<lightumbreon> i never played XBOX or Kinect
<lightumbreon> but i still don't like it
<HyperMetalLugia> PS3/Xbox360 will cause the next game crash
<Darkdragon> Kinect is decent, but not best
<HyperMetalLugia> Too many silly shooters :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I have never touched a 360 or PS3, never plan to either
<Espeon> 06KINECTKINECTKINECT
<Iskierka> kinect is too imprecise, needs too much space, and has various other problems
<lightumbreon> ^
<lightumbreon> in other words, Kinect sucks
<Iskierka> would work best with those fixed and having something actually solid, rather than just dancing with air
<HyperMetalLugia> Duh ;p
<Darkdragon> Maybe
<HyperMetalLugia> Now I wonder if Kinect hates tall people
<Darkdragon> That would explain a lot
<lightumbreon> it's Kinect.....it DOES hate tall people....
<lightumbreon> i wonder what would happen if you put it in a microwave
<HyperMetalLugia> Cool, now I have another reason to not even think about it
<Espeon> 06Kinect - not promoting diversity
*Espeon dies
<HyperMetalLugia> But Kinect + Windows
<lightumbreon> no
<lightumbreon> just no
<HyperMetalLugia> A slightly better mix, as tons of 3rd party programs could be made :P
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<lightumbreon> my PC already hates webcams, it can't even bear it....i think
<HyperMetalLugia> So what is the problem witht the webcams XD
<lightumbreon> ....
<lightumbreon> they hate me
<lightumbreon> and the PC does too
<HyperMetalLugia> Can't get yourself into the picture right?
<lightumbreon> ....
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<lightumbreon> take a wild guess
<HyperMetalLugia> I can't, I just ate frozen yogurt
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<lightumbreon> hehe
<HyperMetalLugia> So it's the drivers then :P
<lightumbreon> yep
<HyperMetalLugia> Well that is what you get for using EW 64bit *runs*
<lightumbreon> always the drivers....
<lightumbreon> nope
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Darkdragon> Lol, ,y brother jyst gace mw a "cat in the gat" Har madr out if duxt taoe
<lightumbreon> i *CAN* run old games
<lightumbreon> ......
<Darkdragon> Sorry, hat was over mah head.
<prince-dari> Was that English?
<prince-dari> O_o
<lightumbreon> i don't know
<HyperMetalLugia> Gibberish O>o
<lightumbreon> i thought that was german
<Iskierka> there's no real reason why 64-bit shouldn't accept 32-bit drivers, I say you're doing it wrong.
<Darkdragon> THE HAT WAS OVER MAH HEAD KK
<lightumbreon> ....
<HyperMetalLugia> I say 64bit is doing it wrong, and 32 is still doing it right
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<lightumbreon> wich case? the english or my drivers?
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, you lose 16bit compatibility ;,;
<Iskierka> 16bit is waaaay out of date
<prince-dari> 64bit's doing it right but CBA to reinstall all my crap.
<Iskierka> and see if you're saying that once the date counter runs out
<HyperMetalLugia> 16bit is waaay- oh, still works
<lightumbreon> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, too bad if it's 16bit, I need to get myself some old 16bit apps/games :P
<lightumbreon> ^
<Iskierka> use emulation
<lightumbreon> those were always good
<HyperMetalLugia> No thanks
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't want to waste more space
<lightumbreon> yay for emulators that f*ck up your PC!
<HyperMetalLugia> Since 64 install takes up more space than 32 + emulators
<lightumbreon> commodor emulators SUCK, believe me
<Iskierka> if it breaks your PC then again, you're doing it wrong
<lightumbreon> i'm not doing it wrong
<HyperMetalLugia> More like the coder is doing it wrong
<lightumbreon> i NEVER do things wrong on the PC
<Iskierka> but again, see how you like 32-bit on the 19th of january 2038
<lightumbreon> ....
<HyperMetalLugia> Iski should stop blaming users for stuff that they can't deal with
<HyperMetalLugia> Hrm, I'll still like it
<HyperMetalLugia> Just like how people like 8bit stuff in 2011 ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> And Windows 3.1, awesome OS
<prince-dari> Because 8bit is best bit.
<lightumbreon> ....
<Iskierka> you don't want an OS that won't break in the next twenty years and can't handle more than 2 GB, alright, your problem.
<lightumbreon> my school thinks that teaching newbs about Win98 helps.....
<HyperMetalLugia> Of course it helps, history is useful
<lightumbreon> morons......
<lightumbreon> EW WIN98
<lightumbreon> EW EW EW EW
<HyperMetalLugia> You mean can't handle more than 3GB derp
<lightumbreon> STUPID CRASHING SLOW EW THING
<lightumbreon> phew...
<Iskierka> single program can't handle 2 GB
<HyperMetalLugia> And that doesn't even matter, since nobody will even have a PC that will work from the 32bit era, or be selling
<lightumbreon> my games use min 2GB ram...
<lightumbreon> try to run THAT on win 98
<drf-Droid> woah
<drf-Droid> Arti's here
<drf-Droid> hi
<HyperMetalLugia> Well those games need to check stuff over :P
<lightumbreon> hehe
<HyperMetalLugia> Since none of my programs are memory hogs
<lightumbreon> big games, for maximum pleasure
<HyperMetalLugia> oh u
<HyperMetalLugia> Small games, for maximum performance and RAM conservation
<Iskierka> games exceeding 1.2 GB are exceedingly rare, editors are the ones that exceed 2 GB
<Iskierka> and if you're on 32-bit, you won't be able to exceed 2 GB, the program will just crash
<lightumbreon> yea right...
<lightumbreon> go Starcraft 2
<drf-Droid> ow my ears
<Darkdragon> Stopppid computor just go tcut off from thd incstermet
<lightumbreon> and Duke Nukem Forever
<drf-Droid> I'm at my sister's graduation
<lightumbreon> german-english alert....
<drf-Droid> and some morons are blowing air horns
<HyperMetalLugia> Ouch, hope you have fun there X
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Darkdragon> Sry
<Iskierka> Crysis didn't reach 1 GB, very few games now will exceed that
<lightumbreon> i never played Crysis....
<lightumbreon> i heard its nice
<drf-Droid> heh
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't game anyway
<drf-Droid> HML, it's just waiting at this point
<lightumbreon> mmhmm
<drf-Droid> http://i.imgur.com/WfeEo.png
<HyperMetalLugia> So do I need to care about games that use over 2GB of ram
<HyperMetalLugia> Nope, point invalid for me L<
<Iskierka> not just games that use it
<drf-Droid> LOL, I enjoy my 16GB RAM
<lightumbreon> i like my 6.g GB
<lightumbreon> *6.5
<Darkdragon> Sure
<HyperMetalLugia> I enjoy my 3GB
<HyperMetalLugia> And 2GB on my laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> I never go over 1GB on here :>
<HyperMetalLugia> 3RAM: Used: 1131/1908MB
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay, I never reach full
<Espeon> 06I have enough for my use, everything went better than expected.
<HyperMetalLugia> So many open programs too..
<Darkdragon> Pssh
<HyperMetalLugia> Malwarebytes is using the most RAM at 100MB LOL
<Espeon> 06I don't even know what firefox does with the memory it rolls around in
<HyperMetalLugia> It's called open-open source software ;P
*Espeon floofs all over SilverSonic. (SilverSonic)
<Espeon> 06well it doesn't bother me, I still have enough memory~~
<HyperMetalLugia> See, the 'open' referrs to how the RAM it uses is empty ;D
<Espeon> 06haha
<Espeon> 06"Just in case I need this RAM I'll hold onto it, kk?"
<Espeon> 06That's what it feels like at times.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup, which is why open source isn't that great at times :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Speaking of oldness, I'ma install MYST on my laptop
<Iskierka> open source is usually better than closed source
<Iskierka> the producers of those just figure "eh, no-one can see that we're being sloppy with memory, who cares?"
<prince-dari> I swear I've played that before. Is it some confusing puzzle game?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> I love it
<prince-dari> Then yeah, I've played that before.
<HyperMetalLugia> Very...impossible :P
<prince-dari> When I was younger, so my brain probably just exploded.
<Nick> brb dinner
<HyperMetalLugia> I want to play RealMyst, but I don't have it
<HyperMetalLugia> (Real time rendering, it's kinda cool)
<Espeon> 06lolmyst
<HyperMetalLugia> Espeon has played it too :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I have the collection/ first three :3
<Espeon> 06was that the first game that came on CD's or something because it had such good still-image graphics? :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Yush
<HyperMetalLugia> 1993 FTW
<Espeon> 06Haha
<HyperMetalLugia> And it is 16bit and for Windows 3.1
<Espeon> 06pointing and clicking erryday
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup, and thinking and waiting :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Now Myst3- Exile looks amazing
<HyperMetalLugia> Even has live action scenes/FMV XD
<HyperMetalLugia> But it uses quicktime for the animations x.x
<Darkdragon> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/160/8/f/8fcedad397e94def07510107e3c63bc6-d3ihxj4.png
<Espeon> 06I expected ponies
<Espeon> 06everything went better than expected
<HyperMetalLugia> Really?
<HyperMetalLugia> You're right
*Espeon keeps floofing all over SilverSonic. (SilverSonic)
<HyperMetalLugia> Thatpic > All of MLP
<HyperMetalLugia> It's a shame that even the updated Masterpiece version is still kinda grainy :|
<HyperMetalLugia> *downgrades quicktime*
<Espeon> 06hhhhhhhh I hate bees
<Skylands> 10Especially the kind that never leave you alone when you swat at them
<prince-dari> NOT THE BEES!
<prince-dari> ARRGGGHGHGH BBLLELE
<prince-dari> How'd it get burned? HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!
<prince-dari> [17:43] <Skylands> Especially the kind that never leave you alone when you swat at them ...You serious? You hit them?
<prince-dari> I've never been stung by a bee or a wasp, and that's probably because I don't freak out around them and try to kill them. >___>
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm very lucky
<Skylands> 10I *hate* any insects getting near me
<Skylands> 10Yes, I run away from them
<Skylands> 10I'm too afraid to kill them :P
<prince-dari> Still you shouldn't hit bees or wasps.
<prince-dari> Then you'll almost definitely get stung.
<Skylands> 10Well, I only hit the small ones (that supposedly don't sting, but they're attracted to your warm skin)
<Espeon> 06I do not hit them, I move away and let them do whatever they do. Usually they go away after a minute or two (lucky me)
<eXAKR> Night
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Angel_Espeon> 13All of my female friends irl are terrified of bees and wasps apart from me o-o
<Articuno> 12I love bees
<Articuno> 12Wasps just annoy me a bit

<God_Bless_The_Broken_Road> 5idk
<Icy> 12i like names
<Iskierka> currently set to not report forum games, and not announce a new post if the last post was in the same topic

<Icy> 12My little pony
<prince-dari> Hahaha, if you watch more you're screwed.
<prince-dari> That's how it starts, at first you think it's not bad, but it's not that great either.
<Icy> 12You know what.... yeah I kinda like it
<God_Bless_The_Broken_Road> 5wow, prissy little girl. knew it...

<Angel_Espeon> 13and hai Ecco ~
<EccoCode> hey lightumbreon and Angel Espeon and everyone
<Skylands> 10Speaking of that, I was disappointed in Lugia's HGSS theme
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ho-oh's > Lugia's
<Angel_Espeon> 13in my opinion
<Skylands> 10Yus
<lightumbreon> ;.;
<Ray> 02yeah
<lightumbreon> why do ho-oh's hate LightLgia?
<lightumbreon> *LightLugia
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I'm also a complete sucker for songs with a traditional japanese feel to them, so xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Hence one of the reasons why I love Okami so much
<xxLatiosxx> 12I agree @ the Lugia theme thing
<Skylands> 10Lugia's was an example of trying too hard, probably
<Skylands> 10Doesn't Lugia and Ho-Oh have the same theme in GSC?
<Ray> 02Yeah, I think so.
<xxLatiosxx> 12My favourite legendary theme would have to be Rayquaza's in Emerald and Suicune/Entei/Raikou's theme in crystal

<Skylands> 10I agree with RSE's Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza battle music
<Skylands> 10I also liked Dialga/Palkia's, along with lake trio

<Ray> 02Golden Rod City for me~
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goldenrod City in GSC <3

<Ray> 02^ :<
<Skylands> 10None of HGSS is, unfortunately
<Ray> 02I need to speed run this game, to get the GB player, Then Spam the heck of it :D
<Skylands> 10I have the GB Sounds on register whenever I play HGSS
<xxLatiosxx> 12I was hoping that we could have had Pokédolls in our rooms again in HG/SS like in GSC u.u
<Angel_Espeon> 13I actually quite like a lot of HGSS's soundtrack
<Ray> 02I'm neutral at HGSS's OST
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like how they made Ecruteak and Cianwood sound different to match the town even though they have the same base tune
<Ray> 02bbl, haircut
<lightumbreon> bye ray :3
<Ray||Away> 02Bye~
<Chimera> 04[16:54:25] <Skylands> 10None of HGSS is, unfortunately

<Damos> I misread that as unstripped
<Damos> +ed
<Kosoveon> o-o
<Creideiki> And if I do write up scripts to attach to me... you best learn JCL.
<Damos> whats JCL?
<Creideiki> 01,01Pain. In its pure distilled form. "Scripting" language used in IBM mainframe operating systems. 01,01Only used if God hates you.
<Damos> IBM?
<Creideiki> International Business Machines - "Big Blue" - made computers back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. Mostly big iron (mainframes). They also "invented" the PC.. in the 1980s. They only make mainframe systems now.
<Damos> oh okay
<Creideiki> Ah, uh... JCL? It's this:
<Creideiki> /IS198CPY JOB (IS198T30500),'COPY JOB',CLASS=L,MSGCLASS=X
<Creideiki> /COPY01 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
<Creideiki> /SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*

<Kosoveon> or I could pay eight bucks to get each score individually through the phone... XD;
<Silvernite> lol XD I just hope I pass my phsychology exam (I'm soo bad at it....)
<Charles> is it odd that one of the assignments for my computer information systems class, Concepts and careers, was to create a blog?
<Charles> or to create a Second Life account?
<Kosoveon> your school has psychology? lucky :O
<Kosoveon> my school had a ton of budget cuts, and psychology was one of the classes that was cut
<Silvernite> that's annoying... our teacher's really bad though so nobody really knows anything XD

<prince-dari> You don't learn anything new from doing homework - it's essentially pointless if you already understand what you've been taught in lessons.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> I need roller coaster tycoon 1.

<prince-dari> ...At least now I know why I never have any ham.
<Neon> Why not my warehouse? I don't need to be kept refrigerated...
<prince-dari> You've been in my fridge before though.
<Neon> I'm already very cool right now.
<Isukra> 12once upon a time Chimera said meow :3
<Neon> Right, because you have way better food.
<Aristeo> Hey Spyrorocks[Air]

<HayateSlash> 12Hey Umbreon
<SilverSonic> oo...oo
*Neon sighs.
<prince-dari> You alright? Or just bored?
<Neon> Bored, mostly. Most of the day has been wasted.
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Neon> I'm pointlessly stuck home when I could have been out all day, but instead I'm sitting here watching Robot Chicken clips. xD
<HayateSlash> 12bbl
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<prince-dari> Well, there's always tomorrow. :P
<Neon> Yeah, indeed there is.
<HayateSlash> 12Hey drf
<HayateSlash> 12and bbl XD
<Neon> Is school out for you yet?
<prince-dari> Not yet, I've got about 6-7 more exams.

<prince-dari> What is that Quanyails?
<Neon> Ah. Are you tense about 'em?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Quanyails> 7Anime convention, prince-dari.
<prince-dari> I decided that I couldn't be bothered to worry.
<prince-dari> Oh right.
<Neon> That's usually what I think, too. xD
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Neon> I just decided I'd never be afraid if paper.
<Neon> *of
<SheenaFox> o3o
<prince-dari> Haha, that's good.
<prince-dari> I haven't thought of it like that before.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy` and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Neon> You're bright, so you probably don't have anything to worry about anyhow.
<prince-dari> Thanks, it's too late to worry about it for most of them anyway, so I there'd be no point.
<prince-dari> -I*
<Quanyails> 7On another note, I met Kroze today.
<Quanyails> 7Sorta.
<prince-dari> Have you had any exams recently?
<Neon> Yeah, it's already underway.
<Neon> I don't have them for another week or so, so nope.
<Neon> We had a sh**load of snow days so school doesn't let out until the end of June. :/
<prince-dari> Oh, they have you make up for time lost?
<Neon> Yeah, unless you're in a private school they do.
<Neon> Otherwise it is in a way cutting time out of your education.
<prince-dari> They don't reclaim the time here.
<prince-dari> Probably because we rarely have enough snow to justify a snow day (though we have about 2 weeks of them last year).
<Neon> I'd say you're lucky, but many wouldn't agree.
<Neon> Snow days aren't what they're cracked up to be, either.
<prince-dari> They're kind of a let down because most of my friends live too far away for it to be convenient to meet up.
<Neon> Yeah, likewise.
<prince-dari> If school was on and we'd all gone it would have been more fun to be honest.
<prince-dari> Massive snow ball fight.
<Neon> Hahaha, yeah. I had my such a great setup one year in my yard with all of these fortifications. There were two decks opposing each other with forts on each. Pretty much an endless supply of snow, too, since we'd just gotten like a foot of it.
<prince-dari> Lol, that sounds great.

<HyperMetalLugia> But the other 88%, fail all the time :P

<Bygios> Kosoveon, you are a 4Clefairy.

<HyperMetalLugia> Well yeah, I mean some products are just bad :P

<Ascendant> Yeah.

<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is reges
<drfsupercenter> 03x

<Ascendant> it's like a filter
<prince-dari> Regular expression
<eXAKR> They are IMPOSSIBLE to deciper
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03ultimately what we need
<drfsupercenter> 03is some sort of "input text, get plain text back" search engine, you know?
<drfsupercenter> 03and then just pass along what it gives
<eXAKR> Something that gives XML output could also be good
<eXAKR> Then at least we know the data structures
<Ascendant> yeeeeeeeah that'd be fantastic
<eXAKR> and then Regex will be easier
<eXAKR> I have tweaked with those in a script somewhere

<drfsupercenter> 03not sure what retarded format they used

<drfsupercenter> 03they said it was made on a Mac
<Ascendant> it's a binhex
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf is a binhex
<Ascendant> er
<Ascendant> it's a .hqx
<Ascendant> it's a mac file
<drfsupercenter> 03EW MACS
<Ascendant> it's like a zip archive
<Ascendant> HQX files help to maintain file integrity for Internet downloads, email attachments, and other file transfers since they combine the data fork and resource fork from the Mac HFS structure into a single archive.
<Ascendant> BinHex 4.0 files take up more disk space than their original binary file. They always begin with the line "(This file must be converted with Binhex 4.0)."
<Ascendant> and uh
<Ascendant> Binary to Hexadecimal text file created for Mac computers; contains data that has been compressed and encoded from an 8-bit binary format into a 7-bit text format; can be useful for transferring binary images, documents, and multimedia as text in email attachments.
<drfsupercenter> 03why the frick would they dot hat
<prince-dari> They take up more space?
<drfsupercenter> 03that seems dumb LOL

<eXAKR> I thought you could have fixed it while I was away for a bit

<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> 20MB is not that large
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> no eXAKR, but for a file to read from it is
<Ascendant> it'll lag the bot a whole lot
<Ascendant> hell
<Ascendant> I can't even select all just the A page
<prince-dari> It takes ~5 seconds to read a 2MB file on mIRC.
<Ascendant> it freezes firefox
<eXAKR> Wow what
<Ascendant> yeah, so it'll take around 50 to read a 20MB
<eXAKR> That's not good
<Ascendant> and not sure if irssi is faster or slower
<prince-dari> 2MB is over a million lines of text.
<prince-dari> So yeah, it's pretty slow.
<Spyrorocks[Air]> Aristeo, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/talkingcats.3gp this is pretty weird.

<Hogia> 12http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-road-lines-fail.jpg XD
<Ascendant> Anyway else besides Hogia that lives in Australia?
<Ascendant> lightumbreon?
<lightumbreon> ermmm
<lightumbreon> netherlands
<Ascendant> >:
<Hogia> 12That caught me by surprise. o.o
<lightumbreon> what did?
<Hogia> 12The fact that you came from the Netherlands.
<lightumbreon> is it such a big suprise then?
<Hogia> 12Not overly huge, seeing as people come from all over the place.
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04Super 8
<Drake> 04@NS
<Armageddon> awesome Drake
<Armageddon> I just saw an ad for it
<lightumbreon> i know right?
<Hogia> 12yeah
<lightumbreon> and where do you come from? UK? USA?
<Iskierka> <Ascendant> Anyway else besides Hogia that lives in Australia?
<Drake> 04XD
<lightumbreon> thanks for pointing out iski
<Hogia> 12lol
<Iskierka> np :p
<Armageddon> XD
<lightumbreon> back to the A+ humour of Duke Nukem Forever :P
<Ascendant> lolwut
<lightumbreon> does anybody here have DNF?
<Ascendant> nope
<Hogia> 12DNF? o.o
<lightumbreon> Duke Nukem Forever
<lightumbreon> it came out internationally friday and for the USA today
<Hogia> 12Oh
<Iskierka> finally the US isn't getting absolutely everything first
<lightumbreon> hehe
<Hogia> 12I walked past ads for it at least five times this morning. O.o
<Zoroark|Shower> usually it's japan :V
<lightumbreon> i had PKMN black....4 days before the US, 2 days before official release :P
<Iskierka> not really, only for nintendo and other japanese producers
<lightumbreon> i love my local "sneaky" gamestore
<Zoroark> why can't they like
<Iskierka> almost everyone else gives to the US first, because they're the cash cow
<Zoroark> release all of them at the same time :V
<Iskierka> because they're silly
<Zoroark> also LU it comes out Tuesday here
<Zoroark> i mean a few different things have already been ruined for me so why bother now :V
<Iskierka> lu, it's not actually that sneaky. A release date is legally only the date it -has- to be released by, it's actually perfectly fine for places to sell it earlier if they have it delivered
<Iskierka> it's just none of the chain places do release early
<Hogia> 12o.o
<Iskierka> it's true, they're allowed to sell it as soon as they have it, they just choose not to
<Hogia> 12that's annoying.

<Articuno> 12Besides making awards because I'm not home yet
<Ascendant> Uh
<Ascendant> !stafftodo list
<ScriptBot> 04ToDo item 1: 03Finish the profile awards.
<ScriptBot> 04ToDo item 2: 03Fix the !define and !google scripts on [TST]Bot.

<Zoroark> i need to leave

<Ascendant> and uh, Articuno, you need to add a link to the chatstats page on the main site
<Ascendant> I have ScriptBot to print it out for the time being but there needs to be a link ;x
<Iskierka> aren't [TST]Bot's scripts in perl or something similarly painful?
<Ascendant> Yes
<Iskierka> I don't fancy being the one to fix those.
<Ascendant> uses bloody regex
<Ascendant> and google keeps changing its format
<Iskierka> :p regex is awesome
<Iskierka> assuming the language makes it easy enough to use

<Iskierka> ... forum games is a ridiculously busy board

<Ascendant> typical, so doesn't bother me :3
<Drake> 04Probably not
<Drake> 04If they don't think I'm a retarded antisocial idiot, they won't think you are.
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> okay
<Armageddon> <McAfreak> has anyone else noticed that CAPSLOCK is an anagram of COCKSLAP?
<Armageddon> facepalm
<Ascendant> Drake, actually, you are a retarded antisocial idiot, just with an added "ass" to it
<Drake> 04XD

<Drake> 04Bah
<Ascendant> so like
<Ascendant> the other day
<Drake> 04oh what happened now
<Ascendant> he glared at me.
<Ascendant> )':
<Ascendant> I'm so sad
<Ascendant> even though that's his default look
<Ascendant> Do YOU know how scary his glare is? D:
<Ascendant> Anyway Drake, remember that uncle sam advertisement that that retarded internet cafe had?
<Ascendant> my school has one that has "I want YOU to join the laptop program" and I'm like facepalm because the IT guys have such a lame sense of humour
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04LOL
<Ascendant> hell, one of them (who is probably responsible for that) knows about the game and goes on 4chan and possibly paheal
<Ascendant> and they have these pokemon comics on their wall
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04._.;
<Ascendant> like, one about scyther
<Ascendant> where ash is like, "SCYTHER, FLY" and nothing happens
<Ascendant> and then gary goes flying overhead on a dodrio yelling "F YEAH"
<Ascendant> and there's also another pic that's like "New record! 4,182,124,934 viruses found!"
<Ascendant> and I'm like "wat" and then looooooool
<Ascendant> and then they have ceiling cat.
<Ascendant> on the roof.
<Drake> 04wat
<Drake> 04Is it watching them- no, I won't do that
<Espeon> 06o-O
<Ascendant> I am mindblown
<Ascendant> but at least they're not a company.
<Ascendant> that...internet cafe. mfw
<Ascendant> rremember it, Drake? We were both like "facepalm"
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> btw, when is the move exactly? and can we haz POPCORN?
<Ascendant> movie*
<Ascendant> also I a weird dream last last last night
<Ascendant> it was something about you and me
<Ascendant> being somewhere
<Espeon> 06doesn't sound weird
<Ascendant> and then Xeli appears and throws us into a cage and locks us up
<Ascendant> and then Altair is in there
<Espeon> 06Oh, okay
<Ascendant> and apparently Xeli and Shiny are the supreme rules of some random dimension
<Ascendant> and then some other random people from TST and HoR appear
<Ascendant> and then Xeli is like, a reincarnation of the Hensh
<Drake> 04o-o
<Ascendant> and then Drake has purple eyes for some reason
<Drake> 04wat
<Drake> 04the movie is at 12pm
<Ascendant> and then we get moved to some random dungeon in some random dark dark castle
<Ascendant> sitting on a floating rock
<Ascendant> and it looks like a dark version of hogwarts...almost like the castle that never was from KH
<Ascendant> and cool, that's fine too
<Ascendant> and then like, Xeli comes up to us and is like "you can join me or die"
<Ascendant> and then suddenly there's rainbow everywhere and Drake and me are floating up in the sky
<Drake> 04...what is with you and weird-ass dreams?
<Ascendant> and then we see Altair there and he's like
<Ascendant> "you have to beat the evil overlord of that place"
<Ascendant> or something like that
<Ascendant> and idk
<Ascendant> and then we float back down and we're all like lalalalalala
<Ascendant> and then we fly away or something
<Ascendant> and then nuke the castle
<Ascendant> and Xeli dies.
<Ascendant> and Shiny escapes.
<Ascendant> I was like "wat"
<Ascendant> and then I woke up and fell asleep again.
<Ascendant> sense = none
<Drake> 04...
<Espeon> 06float
<Espeon> 06that just made it all even weirder for some reason
<Ascendant> no idea
<lightumbreon> just coming back and reading this all....
<lightumbreon> really blew my mind
<Ascendant> I swear I looked like a rainbow magical fairy or something.
<Ascendant> and Drake had purple eyes and his general confuzzled looks
<Ascendant> and rofl lightumbreon
<Ascendant> I think I'm high atm...I had a hot chocolate about 9 hours ago...
<Espeon> 06Hi LU :3
<Espeon> 06And lol
<lightumbreon> ohai floof :3
<Ascendant> but like, Drake
<Ascendant> I need more epic ideas for fanfiction
<Ascendant> and NO that was not epic
<lightumbreon> inb4, hot chocolate....it does THONGS to you....
<Ascendant> that was some retarded dream concoction probably as a result of me eating too much chocolate
<lightumbreon> *things
<Ascendant> thongs
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Drake> 04hmm
*Drake thinks about himself with purple eyes
<Drake> 04Not bad
<Ascendant> Drake
<Ascendant> then you think about me
<Ascendant> as a rainbow magical fiary.
<Ascendant> fairy*
<Ascendant> and then MINDBLOWN
<Ascendant> >mfw
<Espeon> 06Purple anything is a good thing

*Ascendant facepalmed
<Drake> 04...seriously?
<Ascendant> yes
<lightumbreon> that sounds...better than my ex-maths teacher
<Ascendant> he also has one of those "The Game. You just LOST it." motivational posters
<Ascendant> actually that one was my fault
<Ascendant> after I realised he knew about the game
<lightumbreon> he was fat, had NO haircut (hard with no hair) and was UGLY
<Ascendant> I showed him it and he wanted it
<Drake> 04._.
<Ascendant> and then he printed it out and laminated it
<Ascendant> .-.
<lightumbreon> oh my...

<lightumbreon> my ex math teacher....while the school is out swimming
<Ascendant> he's like, one of the few people I actually trust but yet he's probably one of the people I'm kinda scared of
<Ascendant> and believe me when I say there are very few people who can scare me
<Ascendant> and even less who I would trust

<Articuno> 12Yeh a list would be great!
<Damos> I'm in the top
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh joy :p
<Articuno> 12If you could get it to add the new people to the bottom, I could jsut keep track like that
<lightumbreon> fghjsiukfhrsoeuhyfroiefk
<lightumbreon> place 3 for me? no...nonono...why would i need a place that high?
<lightumbreon> i think it's broken....
<Ascendant> If it's broken I wouldn't be at the top ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> I dunno, I've been less active than normal :P
<Ascendant> but then again, I was high about an hour ago
<Articuno> 12I want to average this out a bit
<Articuno> 12I'm going to add the list of people who were on it before, then in a few weeks time update it again
<Damos> Ascendant was high
<Damos> HOW?!
<Damos> HOW! I SAY?!
<lightumbreon> she always is.....
*lightumbreon runs
<Articuno> 12There hasnt been enough activity to count it from now
<Ascendant> Well, I can get ScriptBot to create a list at the end of each month
<Damos> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I dunno, but there's a chance :p
<Articuno> 12Hmm
<Ascendant> it'll gather data every 24 hours or so
*Damos huggles lightlugia
<Ascendant> and add anyone new to its list
<Damos> mine
<Damos> mine
<Articuno> 12Can you get it to create the list specifically every 30 days?
<Ascendant> and then I'll mail it to you
<Articuno> 12Because that's when it ticks over
<Ascendant> yeah that'd be easy
<Ascendant> because I can do that manually
<Damos> I wounder why?
<Ascendant> timer would be unreliable because it goes down every now and then
<Articuno> 12Oh right, I was about to say
<Articuno> 12But you'd need to remind yourself
<Damos> I'll remind him,
<Ascendant> Not hard ;p
<Articuno> 12him ovO

<Ascendant> him? lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Who O.o
<Damos> OMG ITS A POP TART PONY!
<HyperMetalLugia> Not the Nyancat, I thought he was roasted .v.
<eXAKR> Who is him?
<lightlugia> oh god....
<eXAKR> Him?
<eXAKR> 4HIM?
<HyperMetalLugia> Not him c.c
<Damos> Ascendant
<Ascendant> Him from power puff girls?
<HyperMetalLugia> Kill him, erase!
*Ascendant hides
<Damos> lmfao
<Damos> its him
<Damos> him's the one
<Ascendant> and Articuno, what exactly do you mean again?
<Damos> finish him
<Ascendant> do you mean gather data once every 24 hours and compile it, and then give it to you at the end of the 30 days?
<Ascendant> or just get it to check it at the end of 30 days or somethingN?
<HyperMetalLugia> N, odd
<Damos> IU agree
<Articuno> 12Check at the end of 30 days :>
<eXAKR> bbl
<Articuno> 12well, it needs to be timed right..
<Ascendant> That can be done manually I guess ;x
<Ascendant> but well
<Articuno> 12So right before the stats tick over otherwise they'll reset XD
<Ascendant> >timezones
<Ascendant> I guess I could write a date related script
<Articuno> 12The best thing is you're ahead of me XD
<Ascendant> yep xD
<Damos> W
<Damos> ^^
<Damos> V
<Articuno> 12Well dates might be hard, we'd have to work out what's every 30 days for the next year or whatever
<Damos> darn it Ascendant
<Ascendant> -ScriptBot- TIME Sun Jun 12 23:42:06 2011
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Articuno> 12Unfortunately to get the stats to update monthly it has to be 30 days roundabouts
<Ascendant> Well
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice time :P
<Ascendant> how does it reset?
<lightlugia> with a baseball bat
<lightlugia> when you hit it of course :P
<Damos> <Damos> W
<Damos> <Damos> ^^
<Damos> <Damos> v
<Articuno> 12Hmm
<Damos> there its Arty CHan
<Articuno> 12It doesn't reset actually, I just thought about it
<Articuno> 12It's not like a yearly thing
<Ascendant> Do you have to erase the data manually?
<Articuno> 12It counts the last 30 days
<Ascendant> Or do you run a program?
<Articuno> 12Just get a script to count new data every day and have it sent to me every month or so
<Damos> the W is the 3 blade looking things on her head and the v is her beak
<Articuno> 12Data doesn't get erased
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> you could also do stats for the cbox
*Ascendant hides
<Articuno> 12the stats just count the last 30 days
<Articuno> 12lolno way
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh the c-box
<Damos> cbox?
<HyperMetalLugia> That place, urgh :P
<Articuno> 12Shoutbox
<Ascendant> "Most common topic on the cbox"
<HyperMetalLugia> "Ponies"
<Ascendant> HURR DURR PONY CANCER.
<Ascendant> etc.
<Ascendant> I mean
<Ascendant> hi
<Damos> Pony Fireworks
<lightlugia> lmfao
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup, needs some chemo
*HyperMetalLugia hides
*Quanyails 7lurks too much. >>
<Ascendant> Quanyails: lurk moar
<Damos> Pony cars
<Articuno> 12Think you could get it to check who's on teh top 20 every day and then have each person added to a list which gets sent to me?
<Damos> there
<Damos> its the new model for ford
<Ascendant> Yep
<Articuno> 12*each new person
<Ascendant> Just give me a few days to figure out the socket stuffs
<Articuno> 12Interesting ^^
<Articuno> 12Thanks
<Ascendant> I'll probably have to send the list manually though
<Articuno> 12That way it'll be a permanent list of who was on the top 20
<Articuno> 12That's fine
<Articuno> 12Just email it every so often :3
<Ascendant> I was thinking to give you the list
<Ascendant> at the end of each month
<Ascendant> because every 24 hours it should check the stats
<Damos> but woun;d't it have to be for that month though
<Damos> ?
<Articuno> 12Yeh thats fine
<Ascendant> and then make a list
<Articuno> 12I can't see the top 20 changing much in a month
<Ascendant> and if nicks already exist, then it'll just add the nicks that aren't already in there
<Articuno> 12and no Damos, you get the award for being in the top 20
<Damos> Ascendant I'm suprised
<Ascendant> I think you could even run it on Cone instead of ScriptBot
<Articuno> 12Yeh that's exactly what I'd like it to do, just add new people in
<Damos> drf is always the one who speaks alot
<Damos> but now its you
<Ascendant> seeing as Cone would probably be more stable
<Articuno> 12I'll run it on Cone then ;>
<Articuno> 12Where is ScriptBot?
<Ascendant> there?
<Ascendant> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 4Sharpedo.
<Ascendant> well what do you mean?
<HyperMetalLugia> There it is
*lightlugia points to a random tree
<Ascendant> lmfao
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh nice
<Articuno> 12Who runs it?
<Ascendant> I do
<Damos> okay beaten by a ScriptBot. Thats just humiliating
<Articuno> 12Oh is it an mIRC client?
<Articuno> 12Like cone?
<Ascendant> It's run on a VM on one of my servers
<Ascendant> yep
<HyperMetalLugia> `;o
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice
<Articuno> 12cool :>
<Ascendant> it's mIRC 6.21
<Ascendant> Nightshadow|VNC is 6.35
<HyperMetalLugia> ew
<Articuno> 126.2 for the win ^
<Articuno> 12*^^
<Ascendant> well
<HyperMetalLugia> 7.1 FTW
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<Ascendant> for some reason
<Ascendant> it keeps pinging
<Ascendant> NS|VNC has no problems
<Ascendant> but ScriptBot's mIRC sometimes pings for no reason
<Ascendant> I think it's the client as they're on the same computer/connection
<Ascendant> oh well, I'll figure it out one day
<Damos> okay thats just cute
<Ascendant> iir 6.21 has problems
<Ascendant> .
<Ascendant> iirc*
<HyperMetalLugia> Tons of problems I suppose :P
<Ascendant> 7.x sucks
<Damos> iIRC
<Damos> drf would hate that
<HyperMetalLugia> You just can't handle the new-ness of it
<Ascendant> iirc = if I recall correctly
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Ascendant> eh I don't even use mIRC these days
<HyperMetalLugia> Xcrap?
*Damos le gasps
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, Xchat
<Damos> LOL
<Ascendant> x-chat actually isn't that bad
<Ascendant> mIRC sucks tbqh
<Damos> no it doesn't
<HyperMetalLugia> Well the colours are terrible for one, and changing settings isn't as fun :P
<Ascendant> lags like crap, but at least the scripting integration with IRC is good
<Damos> I wouldn't be able to use the
<Damos> the /me
<Damos> script
<HyperMetalLugia> Now if you want fun and hard, try Telnet :D
<Ascendant> x-chat's scripting system is crap
<Ascendant> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> I tried it once on another server
<Ascendant> I did that
<HyperMetalLugia> Never let me in :P
<Damos> Telnet sounds like Dial up
<HyperMetalLugia> Telnet IS Dial-Up era related
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Damos> oh
<HyperMetalLugia> I miss Dial-up, so loud
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohaji

<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Sky :3
<Ray> 02Hi Angel~
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I slept too long again D:
<Skylands> 10Use an alarm clock
<Angel_Espeon> 13But I don't like using alarms unless I need to be awake for a certain time
<Angel_Espeon> 13I feel sleepier than usual if I don't wake up naturally xD
<Skylands> 10Well, it might help "train" you to wake up at a certain time
<Skylands> 10I know it does with me, I wake up everyday at 6:30AM for school
<Skylands> 10Sometimes I find myself waking up that early on weekends, and in the summer too x.x
<Skylands> 10Regardless of what time I go to bed the night before
<Angel_Espeon> 13Up until recently I've been doing pretty well at waking up between 10:30am and 11am, but for some reason I've been getting too much sleep these past couple nights >>
<Skylands> 10What time did you go to bed?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can't remember |D 3am or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13but the time I go to bed tends not to affect the time I get up all that much :B
<Espeon> 06:3
<Skylands> 10Strange
<Skylands> 103AM to 10-11AM ish is 8 hours, which is average
<Skylands> 10You think 8 hours is too much? o.o
*Ascendant yawns
<Skylands> 10ohai NS
<Angel_Espeon> 13I used to think 8 hours was not enough for me, LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13but then I read somewhere that apparently people who get too much sleep tend not to live as long, which got me a bit paranoid so xD
<Espeon> 06I can function somewhat decently on like 5 hours, but I tend to sleep as long as possible sooo
<Skylands> 10Lolsuperstitions
<Angel_Espeon> 13not a superstition, it's apparently proven there's a correlation between people who get too much sleep and how long they live o-o
<Skylands> 10I feel lazy/groggy if I get more than 8 hours or less than 6
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh hush :p
<HyperMetalLugia> I do 5-7 hrs normally
<HyperMetalLugia> But more than that...I feel terrible XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Since I wake up in the middle of the night, so I wait it out
<Angel_Espeon> 13I tend to get about 6-7 hours on nights where I have college the next day, which usually isn't enough for me |D
<Skylands> 10The times I do get enough sleep for school tend to be the days I feel the most tired, oddly
<Angel_Espeon> 139-10 hours is when I normally feel the most awake, but more than that tends to make me feel all sluggish :<
<eXAKR> I need 8 to 9
<Skylands> 10Don't even get me started on all-nighters
*Skylands hides
<eXAKR> And sometimes even that is not enough
<eXAKR> >>
<Espeon> 06aaaand foodtiemz
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've never pulled an all-nighter before
<Skylands> 10Successfully only pulled two all-nighters, and hopefully never again
<Angel_Espeon> 13probably because I know I'll be asleep for the whole day afterwards |D
<Skylands> 10The first one I wasn't prepared for, while the second one was
<Ascendant> why am I not asleep
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Skylands> 10I can remember feeling awful the next morning
<Ascendant> I'm dealing with idiots in a flamewar
<Ascendant> that's why
<Skylands> 10Who?
<eXAKR> Not me
*eXAKR hides
<eXAKR> Anyway
<Ascendant> it's xat crap
<Ascendant> xat used to be hackable via a flash decompiler
<Skylands> 10Ew xat chat
<Ascendant> yes.
<eXAKR> I don't understand why some people can be energised with 6 hours of sleep, while I feel like crap sometimes even after nine
<Ascendant> it's Dakurai's

<Skylands> 10http://xat.com/
<Ray> 02eXAKR, I usually sleep 6 hours .-.
<Skylands> 10I used to go on my friend's xat chatrooms, that's why I know of them
<Ascendant> <Skylands> Drama and n00bs pretty much sums up xat chatrooms
<Ascendant> this
<Ascendant> You know Dakurai, Skylands?
<Skylands> 10From #TF? Yeah
<Ascendant> The guy who used to come on -
<Ascendant> yeah
<Skylands> 10He's annoying
<Ascendant> heh, he's sort of matured
<eXAKR> Ray: And you manage on that?
<Skylands> 10and tries too hard at trolling (at least directly at me, for whatever reason o.o I never did anything to him)
<Skylands> 10[11:10] <%Ascendant> heh, he's sort of matured <- In what ways?
*Skylands mauled
<Ascendant> lmao
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Ascendant> Dakurai doesn't troll
<Ascendant> he's just nooby
<eXAKR> sounds like a place to stay away from
<Ray> 02@eXAKR: yes o-o
<eXAKR> How?
<Ray> 02I don't know xD
<eXAKR> I'm jealous of that Ray
<eXAKR> I WISH I could do 6 hours of sleep
<Skylands> 10Try my uncle, he could function on 3-4 hours of sleep
<Ascendant> holy crap
<Ascendant> well
<eXAKR> What
<Ascendant> I function on 4-5 hours per day
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Ray> 02lmfao.

<eXAKR> My dad manages on 4 per night due to his job
<Ascendant> well, 12 on friday night
<Ascendant> and 8-10 on saturday night
<eXAKR> He then sleeps another 2 to 3 in the late afternoons and evenings
<eXAKR> Ascendant: HOW?!??!?!??!?
<Skylands> 10I think the people who don't receive much sleep just get used to it
<Ray> 02^
<eXAKR> Maybe
<HyperMetalLugia> I've gotten used to it :p
<eXAKR> Jealous.
<Ascendant> xD eXAKR
<Skylands> 10Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't rely on sleep at all? :P
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!

<eXAKR> lol one of the comments on a MLP:FiM episode on YouTube:
<Ascendant> Heh
<Ascendant> I love sleep though
<eXAKR> "Ok, so i was watching MLP, and﻿ SUDDENLY my mom comes in the room! So i quickly switched to porn."
<Ascendant> <3

<Articuno> 12Adoptables even
<Quanyails> 7Yeah.
<Articuno> 12yeh?
<Skylands> 10Ray, what made you decide to watch it?
<Damos> use that Lugia Adoptable
<Quanyails> 7If we could work those in.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I'm surprised that floof isn't on the list of commonly used words
<Damos> that would be so cute
<Ray> 02The Opening
<Articuno> 12Well, we can't easily..
<Quanyails> 7Either as those adoptables or as those awards.
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't watch it Ray :<
<Ray> 02I loved it.
<Quanyails> 7Well, yes, the programming aspect..
<HyperMetalLugia> It's a trap
<Skylands> 10Spamming floof will change that, Espy :3
<HyperMetalLugia> A terrible, scary trap :P
<Ray> 02yes, floofy revolution?
<Angel_Espeon> 13!floof
*Skylands flooooooooofs all over Angel_Espeon "Bow down to my floofiness!"
*Quanyails 7misses J-Lugia's floof cannon-chainsaw-whachamacallit.
<Damos> lets spam floof shall we
<Skylands> 10[12:36] <Ray> The Opening <- Meaning first episode or the opening theme song?
<Damos> spam fest opening please
<Ray> 02Both
<Skylands> 10Ah

<Skylands> 10Lol, Shugo Chara
<HyperMetalLugia> Sugar Chug?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Shugo Chara was good until the 3rd season came out :<
<Skylands> 10I thought Madoka looked more like Ichigo from TMM
<lightlugia> i'm lost on this, ain't i?
<Skylands> 10Especially their magical girl outfits
<Angel_Espeon> 13after that I only watched the episodes with Ikuto in them LOL
*Skylands watched SC up until episode 30
<lightlugia> Star Craft?
<Skylands> 10Dunno why I quit
<Skylands> 10Shugo Chara, LU
<lightlugia> i'm lost forever now....
<Angel_Espeon> 13I watched it up until around the 3rd episode of season 3
<HyperMetalLugia> Same
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's annoying because season 3 only had 15 minute episodes >.> the rest was some childish kiddy stuff completely unrelated to the story
<Angel_Espeon> 13You guys should watch Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka :3c
<Angel_Espeon> 13and no, it's not about rotten flesh-eating zombies
<Skylands> 10Did they ruin the manga of SC too?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I didn't really follow the manga so I wouldn't know ^^;
<Damos> wow Sky I like it
<Angel_Espeon> 13I only read the last few chapters :B
<Skylands> 10Damos, whut?
<Skylands> 10Oh, I used to buy the SC manga, before Borders closed around here. I have up to volume 5
<Angel_Espeon> 13I find it interesting how nearly every time I introduce my friends to an anime they end up falling in love with it more than I do o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13well, it's either that or they simply don't bother with it
<Articuno> 12Gonna turn the forum on aghain in a min
<Angel_Espeon> 13it tends to go either way |D
<Skylands> 10None of my IRL friends really like anime :<
<Angel_Espeon> 13Same really, and the few that do like anime aren't really into watching it as much anymore
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again, I've only recently gotten back into watching anime myself |D
<Skylands> 10Same, thanks to PMMM
<Skylands> 10and partly you XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD I don't watch anime as much as I used to, but I always have plenty of recommendations for people who are interested
<Skylands> 10The last thing I watched before PM was OHHC, which was in 2008-ish
<Damos> lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13when the Persona 4 anime comes out in Autumn, expect me to be all over it :B

<Chimera> 04A DS emulator will be possible
<Ray> 02and I agree with Espy :3
<Chimera> 04because of the thing's horsepower and the "new controller" acting like the touch screen
<Chimera> 04:3

<Articuno> 12Well, that's the top chatters sorted

<HyperMetalLugia> Poor Skylands :<
<Skylands> 10Altair

<HyperMetalLugia> You'll get there again, I think XFD
<Skylands> 10PM?
<Articuno> 12That was a while ago as well..
<Articuno> 12I think sometime in March or before that even
<Ray> 02I think, I was in the top 20. like in January of this year xD
<Articuno> 12Ray you have the award
<HyperMetalLugia> I was in the top 5 I think
<HyperMetalLugia> :P

<Skylands> 10Hang on
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm 11 right now, apparently o-o considering I'm looking at the right thing
<HyperMetalLugia> I think I did LOL
<Damos> lol
<Articuno> 12Angel_Espeon, I'm not counting the new stats for a while
<Skylands> 10Is this one for the top or the consecutive, Arti?
<Ray> 02LOL.
<Articuno> 12That was the award for top chatter
<Articuno> 12I might be able to recover data for consecutive days
<Articuno> 12I'm sure you'd be in there
<Articuno> 12The problem is it doesn't count whoever stays connected XD
<Skylands> 10Well, I'm in top 20 as of the moment
<Skylands> 10#12
<Angel_Espeon> 13And I have no idea why I find the relation map amusing
<Articuno> 12I know but I'm collecting data for about a few weeks before I start adding awards again
<Angel_Espeon> 13I find it interesting how it changed shape all the time |D
<Articuno> 12It's too early and it needs to average out
<Angel_Espeon> 13*changes
<Skylands> 10k
<Damos> I agree
<Articuno> 12right give us a sec, I might be able to find number of consecutive days lol

<Articuno> 12Hi ^^
<Articuno> 12Maybe I should change it..
<Articuno> 12To most days active..
<Articuno> 12Because like I said, it doesn't count people who stay connected
<Articuno> 12What do you think?
<drfsupercenter> 03did you see my PM yesterday?
<Articuno> 12Yeh I did ^^ I need to speak to you about that

<prince-dari> 4Chan isn't better than anything.
<HyperMetalLugia> Everyone's a tard for poines
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes it is
<Articuno> !tstposts
<HyperMetalLugia> Since it has a competitor
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<prince-dari> 4chan is boring and pointless, and filled with idiots.
<HyperMetalLugia> So is Ponychan
<HyperMetalLugia> So it's equal
<prince-dari> Ponychan has a purpose - to talk about ponies, 4chan doesn't.
<prince-dari> Well /b/ board anyway.
<Chimera> 04lol prince-dari
<HyperMetalLugia> 4chan has a purpose, mainly trolling and pics
<HyperMetalLugia> So I dunno, ponywashing it seems
<Chimera> 04/V/ has a purpose
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=7090

*HyperMetalLugia attacks with Uk spelling and us
<HyperMetalLugia> U MAD?!
<SilverSonic> My Pet peeve for americans, spelling words wrong
<Skylands> 10Blue is my favoUrite :3
<SilverSonic> x_x
<prince-dari> You can't argue that color is the correct version. You can only argue that they are both either equally valid, or "colour" is the correct version.
<prince-dari> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I love Blue too, my Favourite as well
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> LaboUr camps are evil
<Skylands> 10honoUr
<SilverSonic> stop it, americans spell it like color
<HyperMetalLugia> flavour
<SilverSonic> sky if your american spell it right
<SilverSonic> x_x
<HyperMetalLugia> And we're not americans
<Ray> 02In America [/reference]
<HyperMetalLugia> She's formerly Scottish?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Skylands> 10SilverSonic, do me a favoUr and stop worrying about it
<HyperMetalLugia> He's always putting too much laboUr into changing the spelling
<Skylands> 10We'll continue to criticiSe him~
<drf|laptop> 03EW UK SPELLING
<HyperMetalLugia> EW WHINY AMERICANS
<HyperMetalLugia> Arti will ban you if you diss it anymore :<
<prince-dari> I can't believe you guys, I tolerate your stupid American spelling and you guys throw it in my face. :(
<Chimera> 04lulz
<HyperMetalLugia> I know :<
<Chimera> 04Dari- I don't care about how anyone spells anything
<Chimera> 04though that should be obvious comming from me XD
<Chimera> 04but still, wtf guys
<HyperMetalLugia> Blame Silversonic x.x
<Chimera> 04it's the same word just spelled differently.
<prince-dari> Haha, I'm not really bothered but that they are complaining about us spelling it the UK way is just annoying.
<Chimera> 04LEAVE IT THE FRACK ALONE.
<Chimera> 04Seriously this is like Sonic Colors VS Sonic Colours all over again
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh that conversation
<HyperMetalLugia> I lulzed
<prince-dari> Oh God no, not Sonic fans.
<Chimera> 04[16:06:36] <prince-dari> Oh God no, not current Sonic fans. <-- fix
<prince-dari> Fair enough.
<Chimera> 04actually no they were never good as a whole ;-;
<drf|laptop> 03says th8e one playing Sonic Colors
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup, how fun
<Chimera> 04says the one who enjoys it and doesn't force people to play it
<Chimera> 04and doesn't spell "the" with an "8"
<Chimera> 04:>
<Espeon> 06wait
<HyperMetalLugia> Espeon
<Chimera> 04eon
*Chimera noms
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh great
<HyperMetalLugia> Here he comes XD
<Espeon> 06why would anyone complain about how someone types a word when it's how they have learned to type it and you perfectly understand it?
<prince-dari> You guys complain about bronies, but MY GOD they don't even compare to how bad a lot of Sonic fans are.
<Espeon> 06that is all
*Espeon rollflop
*Chimera hugs Espy
<Chimera> 04yes
<Chimera> 04prince-dari yes
<Chimera> 04People think '06 was the best game of all time
<Chimera> 04*shudder*
<Espeon> 06denying that a lot of the sonic fandom = bats*it insane is borderline ignorant :P
<Espeon> 06A lot, not all
<Chimera> 04Yet those are the same people who rage when they die all the tome
<Espeon> 06as with any fandom
<Espeon> 06whee
<Chimera> 04|D
<Chimera> 04*time
<drf|laptop> 03I never said it was the best game of all time, but I actually like it unlike some.
<Chimera> 04I think 90% of-
<Chimera> 04drf not you specifically -_-
<Chimera> 04I think 90% of the fanbase is massocistic
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<Chimera> 04hml you know it's true :P
<drf|laptop> 03I think 90% of ANY fanbase is stupid
<drf|laptop> 03except 100% of MLP fans
<Chimera> 04.
<drf|laptop> <MasterG> .....................................................................
<drf|laptop> <judas> where's pacman when you need him?
<Chimera> 04Excuse me but Corey Byrne is one of the smartest people I've met
<drf|laptop> 03who's that
<Chimera> 04He just has... excentric interests
<Chimera> 04someone in my school
<drf|laptop> 03so i care why?
<Espeon> 06what
<Chimera> 04though he can be the, what did you call it? "exception that proves the rule?" :P
<Articuno> 12Gtg dinner, laters!
<Chimera> 04bai
<Chimera> 04:c
<HyperMetalLugia> Bai
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Espeon> 06and I'll be honest, the MLP fanbase is actually one of those where there seems to be a vocal positive majority. Only negative thing I see some of them do is the whole "every forum is ponychan" people who post it everywhere lol
<Espeon> 06Oh well
<Chimera> 04yeah
<drf|laptop> 03what pisses me off is that poeple are changing their forum names, avatars, signatures, etc with ponies
<prince-dari> Why shouldn't people put what they like in their avatar or signiture?
<prince-dari> Posting it everywhere where it's not relevant sure, that's just stupid and annoying.
<Espeon> 06well at least they're not responding to every topic, even serious ones, with ponyname-reaction.jpg. I've seen that on some forums and THAT'S annoying :P
<prince-dari> It's pretty hard no to be annoying when you get so obssesed that you want to post it everywhere, that usually wears off after a couple of weeks though.
<prince-dari> not*
<Angel_Espy|Away> 13don't get me started :<
<prince-dari> Please don't start.
<prince-dari> :P
<Espeon> 06well, some people get stuck there
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like the show, but I've grown to really dislike the fanbase
<Angel_Espeon> 13That's all I'll say
<Espeon> 06like the people who KEEP posting 4chon memes everywhere and think they are the kings of wit.
<Espeon> 06But I won't even start that rant LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13When I get obsessed with something, the most I'll probably do is maybe change my avatar for a bit or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13but that's all
<Angel_Espeon> 13anyway
<Lati> 12LOL obsessions
<Angel_Espeon> 13that hoovering session took more effort than it should've done :<
<Espeon> 06hypocrisy sure is exciting.
<Espeon> 06Oh well.
<Angel_Espeon> 13cba polishing/dusting the house
<Espeon> 06o3o
<Angel_Espeon> 13inb4 my mum comes home and tells me to do the dishses :<
<Lati> 12I feel so lazy when you say things like this LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13blah typo
<Angel_Espeon> 13I only do chores because I don't have a choice LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13I wouldn't mind so much, but I'm pretty much the tidiest person in the house
<Angel_Espeon> 13my parents just leave their crap all over the place =w=
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Aeroslash02)03WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Espeon> 06I'm really not that tidy
<Lati> 12Yeah, I still feel lazy, for instance you've been doing that whilst I was thinking about getting up off my chair, take a few steps to the mini fridge, grab a drink ad walk back and sit down again u.u;
<Espeon> 06but I can if I have to!
<Aeroslash> hi Espeon
<Lati> 12but LOL oops oh well =P
<Angel_Espeon> 13and lately my pet peeve regarding litter has pretty much doubled recently
<Aeroslash> hi Angel_Espeon
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm ALWAYS telling my friends at college to put their litter in the bin rather than leaving it on the table expecting someone else to tidy it up (aka ME)
<Angel_Espeon> 13The annoying thing is that most of them don't take me seriously =w=
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol sorry, in a ranty mood right now |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Aero :3
<Aeroslash> yeah, I get what you mean
<Aeroslash> you have a kitty?
<Aeroslash> D:
<Aeroslash> Hay ate me?
<Lati> 12Oh yeah I don't like it when my friend leaves their food on the table in the food court .w.
<Aeroslash> uber sad face!
*Aeroslash shot
<HayateSlash> 12lol
<Lati> 12especially when he decides to throw KFC wipes on the floor just to be an ass xD
<HayateSlash> 12Hey Aeroslash
<Aeroslash> hello
<Angel_Espeon> 13Don't get me started on people who purposely put litter on the floor instead of getting up to put it in the bin .w.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Hell, I'd rather have them leave it on the table than deliberately put it on the floor
<Lati> 12I know right? xD
<Aeroslash> wait awit
<HayateSlash> 12I had a feeling someone here had slash in their name >.<
<Aeroslash> are you talking about litter boxes?
<Aeroslash> like with cats?
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13Litter in general
<Angel_Espeon> 13as in, people who can't be bothered putting their rubbish in the bin etc
<Aeroslash> oh!
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Lati> 12I remember one of the first things you told me
<Aeroslash> litter like garbage XD
<Lati> 12I#m gonna go find the quote now
<Angel_Espeon> 13I ranted myself to sleep a couple nights ago about people who purposely litter, that's how sad I am |D
<Lati> 12"i just randomly began pointing and laughing at the rubbish bin with the word "litter" on it "
<Lati> 12^ Angel

*Aeroslash shot
<prince-dari> Being tidy, meh. I don't care about it.
<Lati> 12In contrast to my friends rooms, I'm suprised I don't have much of a messy room
<HayateSlash> 12XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't know how people can stand living in a messy environment ;w;
<HayateSlash> 12^
<Lati> 12I have a messy cupboard but lets not go into that LOL
<prince-dari> I prefer it messy to honest.
<prince-dari> Makes it more interesting when I want to find something.
<prince-dari> XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13My wardrobe isn't as tidy as I'd like it to be, but I've never bothered to organise it properly because I still know where everything is
<Lati> 12Since I'm moving to a new house soon I'm probably going to have to sort all the junk out..gah thats going to be annoying

<Ray> 02AVG > Norton.
<HayateSlash> 12Also, that "Malicious Web Site" is dA |D
<Ray> 02Almost Everyting > AVG
<prince-dari> Avast! is good too.
<prince-dari> You're probably safer without Norton.
<HayateSlash> 12Na, I'm too safe with Nortion
<prince-dari> I had Norton once and a virus made it go crazy and crash my computer.
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> Then nothing would work till I used an uninstaller tool to get rid of all traces of Norton.
<Espeon> 06wb Sky :3
<HayateSlash> 12McAfee did that to me
<Skylands> 10Thanks Xeli ;3
<Skylands> 10:3*
<Espeon> 06... xD
<HayateSlash> 12Ew McAfee, I'll never use them again
<prince-dari> I think Norton was also the AV that found 10,000 trojans and decided that it couldn't delete any of them.
<Espeon> 06just a heads up, eh? :P
<HayateSlash> 12Ew AV, get a full security suit
<prince-dari> It was.
<HayateSlash> 12Oh
<prince-dari> Came with the computer or something.
<HayateSlash> 12Ew trial security suits
<prince-dari> Eww paying for security that is worse than free software.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew security in general
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<HayateSlash> 12Eww Ewwing paying for security that is worse than free software.
<HyperMetalLugia> The best security is common sense
<HayateSlash> 12XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Eww using free software that is worse than paid
<HyperMetalLugia> Or at least more buggy ;p
<prince-dari> Avast! isn't buggy?
<HyperMetalLugia> Avast is SLOW
<HyperMetalLugia> All AVs are slow and crashy
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> It's not slow?
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is why I don't use a active one
<Ray> 02That's why I Stick with AVG 2011 and Common Sense.
<Ray> 02:D
<prince-dari> It's using 0 CPU and only 7k memory.
<prince-dari> Even winrar is using more than double that memory on my computer. >__>
<HyperMetalLugia> Just use Xp Security Center 2011
<prince-dari> Or just fix viruses you get yourself.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or just don't get viruses at all
<prince-dari> Pretty hard with all the things I pirate.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well don't pirate you fool
<HyperMetalLugia> Geez, people whine about viruses
<prince-dari> I wasn't whining about viruses?
<HyperMetalLugia> When they do stuff that makes them deserve to get it
<prince-dari> I was just saying that Avast is better than Norton.
<HyperMetalLugia> I wasn't talking about you :P
<prince-dari> Oh, ok.
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean other virus prone pierats
<Damos> ow
<Damos> ow

<Hooh54> 4^ Agreed
<Damos> Hi Arty 2
<Hooh54> 4Zoroark, I'm guessing you're Arti
<Quanyails> 7Ah, lag.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've been convinced to add anime in the past simply by showing me an interesting gif or a certain good scene from it or something xD
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<Quanyails> 7Mmm...
<HyperMetalLugia> He is not arti
<Zoroark> no i am not

<Hooh54> 4FINALLY someone who thinks Minecraft is stupid
<prince-dari> Pokemon is for 6 year olds!
<prince-dari> Problem?
<Roleplay4life> 5In defense, some of the plot lines and stories in Pokémon have been rather ridiculous.
<Roleplay4life> 5Maybe even "stupid", to use the term. (;
<May|Writing> 14<prince-dari> Pokemon is for 6 year olds! <-- you do realize this is a Pokemon fansite, right?
<SilverSonic> ^
<Lati> 12To each their own
<Hooh54> 4I like the fact that I'm the only one with colored text, but then May and Roleplay posted

<Hooh54> 4My little pony is mlp
<Nick> I just don't get how something that's been around for so long suddenly re-exploded in popularity again
<Roleplay4life> 5MLP = My Little Pony. It's a TV series.
<Jerry> okay so...has anyone seen Higurashi?
<prince-dari> Super Mario Bros. live action film must have been written by monkeys.
<Lati> 12YES
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have
<Jerry> oh..wait..isn't that a kids show?
<prince-dari> The script was SO bad.
<Jerry> ME TOO
<Nick> I mean ok Transformers did it but that had a blockbuster hollywood movie franchise behind
<Lati> 12One of my favourite animes <3
<Jerry> Lati: same here :3
<Jerry> Rika ftw
<May|Writing> 14AKDHLKAL WHYYYYY NOW I'M GOING TO GET CRAZY ON TOUHOU MUSIC D:
<Nick> also bang on with the mario bros movie quote
<Jerry> i'm still on season 1 though.
<Roleplay4life> 5Michael Bay Transformers is the dirge of films. D|
<Lati> 12Rika's awesome! Mion's my favourite character though =)
<Angel_Espeon> 13Rena for me~
<Hooh54> 4The only thing good about Higurushi is one of the theme songs. *hides*
<Jerry> Rena=chopper
<prince-dari> Bowser tries to rape Daisy, his wife stabs Yoshi, and he pretty much has a harem of kidnapped women? HOW IS THIS A CHILDREN'S FILM?!? HOW?!
<Jerry> o.o
<Nick> lol
*Jerry gives Angel_Espeon a Rena
<Lati> 12she's gonna take you home
<Hooh54> 4._.
<Lati> 12watch out
<Jerry> yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Nick> why does hollywood try its upmost best to remain as far away from the video game source material as possible?
<Jerry> she's gonna go crazy over you and then try to take you home XD
<prince-dari> God only knows Nick.
<Roleplay4life> 5Because video games often make for bad films.
<Nick> Resident evil one movie, was ok, coulda been considered a seperate story within the RE universe
<Roleplay4life> 5Kind of like books. Only worse.
<May|Writing> 14Who knows how to link Youtube videos to the TST profiles?
<May|Writing> 14Because I forgot the coding to that
<Hooh54> 4I just watched a movie about BURDS
<Roleplay4life> 5What movie?
<Jerry> Lati: did you complete season 1-3?
<Nick> RE2 movie: completely fails in trying to combine the plots of the movie and RE3 video game and completely mucks it up that it satisfies no one
<Hooh54> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYh40mcj8dc
<Lati> 12Jerry - Yep =)
<Jerry> awesome :D
<Hooh54> 4oH AND i WATCHED rIO
<Hooh54> 4*Oh, and I watched Rio
<May|Writing> 14bah forget it, I'll go look for a topic
<Jerry> Higurashi is one of the few animes that can really get you tensed up at certain parts
<Lati> 12Hehe tell me about it <3
<Nick> it doesn't satisfy the movie crowd cos they don't know whats going on, and it doesn't satisfy the fans of the video game because it completely differe to the source material and mucks up the game's plot
<Jerry> and the soundtrack=creepy
<Angel_Espeon> 13May, go on the youtube video, then share -> embed -> check "use old embed code" -> copypaste the code into your media section :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I can't remember how to make it autoplay though
<Nick> same with super mario bros only they tried their upmost best to remain as far away from the source material
*Jerry also gives Lati a Mion at the same time*
<Lati> 12I love the main theme song <3
<prince-dari> Apparently they didn't have much source material to work with at the time the Super Mario Bros. film was made though.
*Lati gives Jerry a Rika
<Lati> 12=D
<Jerry> ;D yay
<Hooh54> 4Neigh
*Jerry prods a neighing Hooh54
*Ray||HardCoreHomework sits on Jerry's head
<Ray||HardCoreHomework> 02:3c
<May|Writing> 14Angel, I meant how to code it in to the Media section
<May|Writing> 14I'm not sure what the CODING is
<May|Writing> 14I know how to do that, just not the coding lol
<Nick> I'd take italian plumber rescuign a princess from a dragon while jumping on living mushrooms over a plot about the dinosaurs living in a seperate dimension due to the asteriod, where they evolved into creatures that looked exactly like humans anyway, and Mairo is played by a prolific British actor who specialises in violent mob movies
<Hooh54> 4NEIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<May|Writing> 14I have horses, Hooh54. And I'm sure they'd love to meet you. :>
*Jerry pets Ray
<Angel_Espeon> 13don't you just copypaste it into the media section? o_o
<May|Writing> 14only problem is we have stallions that are a little crazy right now
<prince-dari> I've got to say though, the film was so bad it was hillarious.
<Hooh54> 4My RL friend has horses
<May|Writing> 14no, it needs coding, Angel
<Damos> I have horsies too
<May|Writing> 14like [img] and stuff
<prince-dari> The goombas were creepy as hell.
<May|Writing> 14Damos, what kind?
<Nick> lol yeah
<Ray||HardCoreHomework> 02May, No they don't
<May|Writing> 14or what breed I should say
<Damos> if we had Cookie and crumb it would be a complete set
<prince-dari> And the bobomb at the end. XD
<Damos> Oreo Cookie Crumb
<Nick> 12 foot tall soviet cossacks with a tiny head
<Angel_Espeon> 13strange, I just copypasted the embed code into my media section and it worked
<prince-dari> Yeah, hahaha.
<Jerry> Lati: its funny how Keiichi is the one that gets killed directly/indirectly in every single arc that I've watched
<Ray||HardCoreHomework> 02you literally just copy and paste the embed code.
<Ray||HardCoreHomework> 02and that's it.
<Nick> actually soviet cossacks is so totally wrong historically o.o
<Hooh54> 4wat
<May|Writing> 14hmm, I'll check it then and see if I can do it
<Nick> cossacks actually fought the soviets xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13just make sure to use the old embed code o3o
<May|Writing> 14oh I see
<May|Writing> 14I just clicked the wrong one lol
*May|Writing fails

<Drake> 04wat
<Roleplay4life> 5Purple is the best colour. But I digress. I had to go cook some things and now I have to go eat dinner. :|
<prince-dari> MLP reference.
<Hooh54> 4NEIGH
<Drake> 04Avatar does not equal chat color.

<Chimera> 04you silly
<Angel_Espeon> 13so in the UK, you're 20 years and 1 day old :D
<Hooh54> 4ARCHEN >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Swoobat
<Chimera> 04XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Something not 5thgen >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 5thgen
<Angel_Espeon> 13Archen = defeatist = fail
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<Quanyails> 7If we're talking about flying types, well, TST. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3c
<Quanyails> 7Really, AE? :3
<Quanyails> 7Acrobatics + Flying Gem = WIN.
<Chimera> 04^
<Hooh54> 4You can not grasp the awesomeness of Archen!
<Chimera> 04Defeatist?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Any flying-type could do that :B
<Hooh54> 4^ Suckish ability
<Quanyails> 7Ability that cuts Archeops's attack stats to half at half HP.
<Quanyails> 7And AE, no, not really.
<Chimera> 04wait wow
<Aurora> 6flying gem?
<Chimera> 04why does that happen
<Chimera> 04:c
<Lati> 12power swap
<Aurora> 6what's that
<Quanyails> 7How many Flying types have 140 power?
<Chimera> 04um
<Chimera> 04a gem
<Quanyails> 7 140 attack, that is.
<Chimera> 04that boost flying
<Quanyails> 7Base.
<Chimera> 04:P
<Quanyails> 7</details>
<Aurora> 6but doesn't acrobatics lower its strength when the pokemon is holding something
<Quanyails> 7It's consumed before the attack.
<Chimera> 04^
<Quanyails> 7So the attack is still doubled.
<Aurora> 6oh the gem is a consumable item
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Chimera> 04yep
<Quanyails> 7 165 attack + STAB.
<Hooh54> 4Just EV it in attack + flying gem + acrobatics = awesome
<Aurora> 6god that attack would be awesome then xD
<Chimera> 04Edable Chaos emeralds
<Quanyails> 7(And 140 attack.)
*Chimera runs
<Chimera> 04*Emeralds |3
<Hooh54> 4I'm actually thinking about using Archeops on my team
*Quanyails 7used one. o3o
<Quanyails> 7I battled with it in AnimeNEXT.
<Quanyails> 7OHKOing Hydreigon is an impressive feat.
<Quanyails> 7(For me, at least.)
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've hardly touched White since I finally got Reshiram on the game |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nowadays I've just been using it for game sync and stuff
*Quanyails 7has a good ~300 hours?
<Hooh54> 4Hydreigon is good, but its speed is horrid
<Quanyails> 7Choice Scarf, a possibility.
<Lati> 12UGH the loading screen
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll probably start playing it again once I finally get my espeon from the GL
<Lati> 12I still can't even get into dream world LOL
<Chimera> 04nuu
<Chimera> 04later Roara
<Hooh54> 4Yay, I spent a week trying to get GL Espeon
<Quanyails> 7On the DS or on the website, Lati?
<Quanyails> 7I don't touch Game Sync much now. X.x
<Lati> 12The website, I click dream world and it says 0% and looks as if its loading and never does
<Quanyails> 7I got my Drought Vulpix, soo... :P
<Lati> 12just sticks to 0% >_<
<Quanyails> 7Ah, Lati, then I think you have to update your Flash player.
<Lati> 12Ah that makes sense! =P
<Drake> 04Quan
<Quanyails> 7Mmmhmm?
<Drake> 04how'd you get a Drought Volpix?
<Quanyails> 7 10000+ points, Pleasant Forest.
<Neon> I have the Hitmonlee pic up, finally.
<Drake> 04...oh
<Angel_Espeon> 13I still only have 2000-something points |D
<Quanyails> 7Getting 500 every day allows you it in 20 days.
<Hooh54> 4I have like, 50
<Quanyails> 7Not too bad. XD
<prince-dari> Pixs.
<Hooh54> 4I don't go on the dream world much XD
<Neon> I'll just sext it to you.
<Quanyails> 7 50 is pretty dang low. O_o
<prince-dari> ttly
<Quanyails> 7Seeing as (before the update), you get 50 for sending a dream pokemon to your game.
<Angel_Espeon> 13ever since I got one Dream Pal, people seem to visit my house every day and such now o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13makes me feel loved |D

<prince-dari> The Fan Handle Rule: If a board is themed after a series, users who sign up with a screen name pertaining to the series (Kefka2938) will do one of three things:
<prince-dari> Lose interest in the forum and vanish very quickly,
<prince-dari> Change their name when they become a respected member of the community,
<prince-dari> Consistently act like an idiot and be liked by nobody.
<prince-dari> "OMGSPYRO4LYFE20000841"
<Quanyails> 7Ah, well. Rule #97 strikes, I guess.
<prince-dari> And such.

<Roleplay4life> 5It's funny, I feel closer to the average age of most of us on TST, but over at TRF I'm considered a really young person. D:
<PokemonStar> lol
<Light_Latias> lol
<SilverSonic> lol
<Ray||Homework> 02lol
<PokemonStar> I feel young here .-.
<Chimera> 04back
<Chimera> 04hm
<Hooh54> 4Lol
<HyperMetalLugia> And your point is?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Chimera> 04Guys, interesting theory
<PokemonStar> Hmm?
<Chimera> 04Anyone think that Nintendo'll add 3D support to the Wii U controller?
<Hooh54> 4The theory of lol
<prince-dari> People tend to assume that I'm older than I am when they first talk to me.
<Roleplay4life> 5There are maybe seven to ten active users my age, and no more than five younger than me. /shrug
<RDMR> 02.-.
<PokemonStar> Ohey there
<Hooh54> 4._.
<Roleplay4life> 5I remember when I first started going into IRC Chat here in 2007 Arti and a few other people figured I was at least a few years older than I actually was. xD
<PokemonStar> xD
<Quanyails> 7Hmm. I'd say the same for me. Except not first into IRC.
<Roleplay4life> 5The general reaction was something like "You're /fourteen?!/"
<PokemonStar> Some people think I'm older than my actual age .-.
<PokemonStar> Ah xD
<Roleplay4life> 5But now I'm going into college and I feel OLD.
<prince-dari> You people with your decades-earlier-than-midlife-crises.
<Hooh54> 4I bet people think I'm older then I actually am
<PokemonStar> Lol youre not old. 70-80 is old
<Roleplay4life> 5But IRL I look really young and I'm short so they don't believe me when I tell them I'm going to be a freshman in college.. Well, sometimes. It depends. If they start talking to me they assume I'm already in college. It's really weird.
<Chimera> 04Ho-oh
<Chimera> 04I doubt that
*Chimera runs
