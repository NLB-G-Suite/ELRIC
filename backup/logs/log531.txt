<MadSurge> Well, you're a Spy, you know about GOOD guns :D
<Glacymr> yes me
<CriticKitten> Sumica: With his pointer finger, without dropping the gun or moving enough to bump it over?

<Kandarihu> Oh, this sounds familiar. So this is where Little Kuriboh got the theme for The Abridged Series
<OtakuTom> The moment he broke the rules, he lost. He would have been frozen in fear of when seeing the extra eye on Yuugi's forehead.

<mishia> STOP USING THAT WORD
<Kencolt> Starlight_Phoenix: Well, rather like the real life ard game with three differences. One, you have only 4000 LP. Two, you wind up playing with holograms and evil dream spirits are real. and three, any main character can pull a card or useful rule out of his ass whenever it fits the plot.
<CriticKitten> No Field Magic Card does that! :|
<mishia> D:
<CrimsonPhoenix> BEWD is so common now
<CriticKitten> Kencolt: Living Arrow?

<Phase4> flutterchu, i recomend doing it away from your keyboard
<Phase4> just in case
<mario_pony> LightNight: which documentary?
<Ponies47> I'm still here :P
<Phase4> you have not seen the horrors of soft drink on keyboards
<LightNight> Ballad of the Brony
<LightNight> its about an hour long
<Chrysalis> Phase4 could be worse
<flutterchu> don't worry i have a building full of keyboards not relly but you know what i mean
<mario_pony> oh yeah i've seen it
*Lighty noms on the lollipop and drinks the milk =w=
<Chrysalis> my mum spilt a load of porridge on hers
<Ascendant> er junh
<Phase4> ew
<Phase4> that would have started to smell
<Ascendant> bouncedccs is terrible
<OtakuTom> And he accidentally eats the ambassador during the fight.
<LightNight> unfortunatly for me no bronies in Canada
<Chrysalis> LightNight therea re bronies everywhere
<Chrysalis> just gotta find em
<pony_6894> I'm going to Canada in July. Does that count? :P
<Ascendant> half the time it ends up dos'ing the server rather than simply downloading the file(s)
<Ghost30k> Oh Ballad of the Brony was an amazing documentary
<DoomrbringerZero> i'm canadian
<LightNight> it will
<Ascendant> if you disable it, you can use DCCs
<LightNight> when u get here :P
<Ascendant> but theoretically bouncedccs is possible, it just is annoying to get working and I usually don't bother
<junh1024-XD> well, i'm trying to DCC to someone that has a bouncer `\(°.o)/´
<LightNight> well in the ontario region :)
<Ascendant> what BNC software?
<Phase4> mlp season 3 y u so far away
<Ascendant> ZNC, psyBNC, sbnc, etc.?

<Ascendant> oh
<Ascendant> who?
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: are we frends
<pony_6894> Wait, doesn't it release in the summer? :S
<junh1024-XD> HML, but he just came in with a non-BNC in the end
<Ascendant> is it Skylands, HML-
<Ascendant> Ah
<LightNight> if they discontinue the show I am going to be upset such an amazing show I hope that it goes on for at least 40 more years
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: perioud perioud.......perioud youre choice
<Ascendant> you need to disable bouncedccs
<Phase4> pony_6894, i'm in australia so i have no clue when your summer is
<Ascendant> /znc loadmod admin

<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: my choice?

<Iron_Edge> SlurryMoon: Isnt it like pudding or jello or something?
<Ponies47> flutterchu: I've brohoofed here and also with poeple in real life :p
<SlurryMoon> 3Only when I travelled to Costa Rica did I realize it was a spanish dessert
<OtakuTom> It's weird...Linux reads my backslash/vertical line as < and >, so I can't do a left-facing brohoof, only right-facing like this /)
<SlurryMoon> 3or hispanic, I don't totally remember
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: i dont appreciate gifts unless i earn them by slavory
<MadSurge> :3
<Ponies47> SlurryMoon: Intresting
<Cypresswolf> first saw & tried flan in Cozumel 2006 I think
<MahBoi777> how was it Cypresswolf?
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: um ok
<MadSurge> So he was supposed to be hispanic? He had no accent in the italian dub.
<Sumica> 00,10Well Flan is kinda a hispanic thing
<MahBoi777> that is the only way to travel right there
*Noir signs the indiana jones theme song.
<SlurryMoon> 3this ep is disgusting
<SlurryMoon> 3so much vomit
<scottish-geeky> Noir: grate minds think a likye
<Cypresswolf> didn't like it much - trying to think of something to compare it to...

<Phase4> http://www.reomobilemedia.com/Sonic_Roadboom
<Noir> Ewww projectile spew.
<MadSurge> At least Courage isn't having his period *shot*

*scottish-geeky gives flutterchu a hug
<Chrysalis> inb4 someone submits brony fukireta to that thing Phase4

<Ponies47> *about
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT SLAVORY
<MahBoi777> and they all got fat......BEST ENDING EVAR
<Phase4> Chrysalis, XD
<Phase4> Chrysalis, i hope so
<MadSurge> MOAR YU GI OH
<Chrysalis> i dont
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: idk waht slavory is im not that smart
<Cypresswolf> I thought flan was more of a jello consistency, but actually more rubbery, can't remember the taste exactly
<Noir> Tugi looked stoned for a sec ther.
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: forcing someone to work for money that's what slavory is
<MadSurge> That flan looked more like pudding though
<Noir> yugi*
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: ohhh i read it rong -_(\ gwad i rilly am a idot
<Cypresswolf> but the flan I had was made in the kitchens of the resort we stayed at - Im certain if I ordered it at a restuarant it would have been better
<MadSurge> ANCIENT EGYYYYPT
<MadSurge> *shakes fist*
<Noir> Cheep looking watches.
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: idiot's are only idiot's if they call them that,because that's wrong idiot's get everything wrong
<OtakuTom> Are you sure that's the best watch? It only says Best on it :P
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: u just minde fucked me
<scottish-geeky> dat swetervest
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: wow did i relly do that i never knew i had that much power
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: lolz
<Cypresswolf> :) Not a very good resort though, buffet everynight, but the hotel staff were too quick to clear your table every time you got up - I'd have a plate full of food and a cup in hand, go to fill up the cup after setting my plate down to get a drink, come back and the plate would be gone - cleared by the wait staff :|
<Glacymr> thanks
<scottish-geeky> da fuck
<Cypresswolf> surprised I didn't starve :P
<OtakuTom> So apparently Yuugi still hasn't learned his days of the week?
<flutterchu> scottish-geeky: i think i mind fucked myself
<scottish-geeky> flutterchu: how?
<OtakuTom> Or is it somehow magically that time of the year where there's no school? lol
*Ponies47 Explodes
<flutterchu> by reading that comment
<MadSurge> Yugi's hormones went all to his hair o__o
<Noir> ah a time when people use to wear watchs for more tha a fashtion statement.
<scottish-geeky> por tristan or honda is in in the frend zone
<OtakuTom> I still use my watch. It's faster than having to pull out my phone to see what time it is (at least when I'm not in front of a computer...and even then I'll check out my watch first)
<Evil_Spike> Subbed Yu-Gi-Oh? Wow, interesting
<Noir> Damn, some one has a watch fetish.
<Cypresswolf> :D that looks ridiculous
<Evil_Spike> And I didn't watch Yu-Gi-Oh as a kid
<scottish-geeky> RAINBOW
<Cypresswolf> who needs that many watches
<OtakuTom> And I'm sure wearing them like that is severely dropping their value...lol
<Evil_Spike> I have 3 watches...
<Sumica> 00,10Screw the rules I have 9 watches
<Evil_Spike> Digital wrist watch, FMA Pocket watch and phone
<scottish-geeky> she talkins in a therd person
<Noir> Why do a feal like smacking Honda with a mallet?
<scottish-geeky> da fuk
<Cypresswolf> only "watch" I own is my cell phone - electricians cant wear anything on the job - not even ear rings in some cases
<Evil_Spike> Is this Duel Monsters subbed or original Yu-Gi-Oh
<OtakuTom> I've got an FMA pocket watch that broke on me (the winding mechanism broke) and my wristwatch (not digital :P)
<MadSurge> Same Cypresswolf.

<Phase4> 00,02too late now
<Kammerjunk> When an irresistable force such as you meets an old immovable object like me, you can bet as sure as you live, something's gotta give.
<Mutterguy> Phase4 is commiting 'science'

<Phase4> 00,02that was chool
<d3rb> Phase4: that is so fucking cool :D
<Phase4> 00,02cool'
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: A "chrysalis" is a pupa of a butterfly.
<Kammerjunk> Broadly, it's just an insect pupa.
<d3rb> ^ i did not know that....the more you know!
<Phase4> 00,02insta boomn
<Kammerjunk> d3rb: Well, you know what they say.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, and the other amazing discovery!

<Mutterguy> Phase4, You'd be able to see that from HOBART!
<Dalekkahn> Bronystate: Pioneering the Kerbal Fireworks Program
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Spell-of-Gaming> Apparently, there's a horror movie called "The Changeling". It was released long ago before FiM.
<Spell-of-Gaming> The horror movie is from the Philippines, where I live.
<DoomStyler> I think you need to go Higher
<Sumica> 00,10I realy should have tryed stuff like this with wheel of death
<Sumica> 00,10try the realy fast jets again Phase4
<KwakLad> if you got it to hold together it would be spinning so much you might say it was the drill that would pearce the heavens
<Phase4> 00,02theres no more science here
<Phase4> 00,02this is just bombing the space center
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...but it's not that suprising if they adapted it from that... two of the animation studios for FiM are on the Philippines.
<Dalekkahn> Isn't "drill that would peirce the heavens" from some sort of anime?
<KwakLad> its a refference to Gurren Laggan yes Dalekkahn
<Chrysalis> Dalekkahn yup
<Chrysalis> Gurren Lagan
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah behing higher up works better with spinning
<Chrysalis> oh man how ILL must those guys feel
<Sumica> 00,10less air drag
<Spell-of-Gaming> Phase4: May I post a link? >.<
<Phase4> 00,02that allmost worked
<Spell-of-Gaming> Well, video link.
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, sure

<DoomStyler> Whats the name of this Game?

<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm still amazed Google Chrome would do something like that.
<Mutterguy> Spell-of-Gaming, they're run buy ultra-geeks. it's bound to happen
<Mutterguy> *by
<Spell-of-Gaming> Funny thing is, it has more views than the Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga Google Chrome Japan ad.

<User0> 'morning
<Petrified_Discord> Huh. Slow chat.
<User0> apparently so

<User0> I'm a tad sad that TF2 tends to be played while I'm stuck at work...
<Petrified_Discord> Same here.
<Jaketehsnake> What Ponyfortress erver are we on?
<User0> Petrified_Discord: My workday started 18 minutes ago...
<EspyLacopa> Adorable Trash, eh?
<Petrified_Discord> User0: LOL. Mine starts in 12 :P
<User0> Petrified_Discord: nice, nice
<Jaketehsnake> Who is streaming?
<Kandarihu> Great. Sounds like someone on this voicechat isn't familiar with One Piece.
<EspyLacopa> What voice chat?
<Kandarihu> On TF2
<Kandarihu> On the stream
<User0> Phase4: I see you are enjoying that spy...
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<EspyLacopa> SPY CHECK!
<killerpony7733> Good afternoon everypony
<Petrified_Discord> Good morning killerpony7733
<Kandarihu> Man, I was about to comment that Phase's buildings never get relentlessly attacked like mine do. Then, the Spy started attacking repeatedly.
<User0> Kandarihu: I normally roll with minisentries, so I don't care if mine die...
<Ingwaz> dead....
<Kandarihu> I don't even have my Gunslinger yet.
<Chrysalis> the gunslinger for engineer is very hard to use properly
<User0> Was it the gunslinger which I had 8 or 10 of?
<Kandarihu> The Gunslinger is what you use to build Minisentries, right?
<User0> (I filled up my inventory, so I just scrapped everything 3+)
<User0> Kandarihu: yeah
<Jaketehsnake> gOOD mORNING eVERYPONY
<Kandarihu> I just saw a rather not-so-decent spray near the exit to the BLU base.
<Jaketehsnake> It is a good end to an allpnighter.
<Petrified_Discord> Mornin' Jaketehsnake
<Kandarihu> Oh, never mind.
<Jaketehsnake> Mornin
<Kandarihu> It was a combination of sprays. And one of them is gone now. So it's all cool.

<killerpony7733> MasterBoss43: hey be nice i just said no from my part......
<MasterBoss43> killerpony7733 I don't love and tolerate people like you.

<Ascendant> They changed the dark brotherhood joining system ):
*Ascendant sadfaces
<Ascendant> I murdered 2 people for nothing
<Espeon> Lol yeah, it's a quest now
<Ascendant> Also it's a lot easier to kill people in Skyrim than in Oblivion
<Ascendant> it was so god damned hard to kill people in Oblivion ._.
<Espeon> i liked that as at times it was pretty ridiculous in oblivion
<MasterBoss43> dougnutjoe i said i am going to register on ponyfortress.com and i did ask for them to ask why i got banned.
<Ascendant> what was?
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
<Espeon> especially considering elder scrolls "hard mode" simply equals "you do 50% damage they do 200% damage enjoy"
<Ascendant> Oh yeah that
<Espeon> the health people had in oblivion was
<doughnutjoe> MasterBoss43 Alrighty then!
<Espeon> kind of hilarious at times
<Ascendant> yeah ._.
<killerpony7733> Sylandest: afternoon and i'm good woke up about a hour or so ago
<User0> Sylandest: chillin at work, pretty good
<Ascendant> They have too much time to scream
<diddutz> i'm off for an hour or so, cu
*Sylandest hugs killerpony7733 and User0
<doughnutjoe> User0 Your at work? :O
<Sylandest> diddutz: laters!
<Ascendant> but yeah a lot easier to kill now
<Espeon> get that assassin's blade perk + the assassin gloves and sneak attack everything
<Ascendant> which is good
<Espeon> no more screams.
<User0> doughnutjoe: yeah
<Espeon> ever
<Ascendant> XD
<Espeon> because 30x damage is fair
<Ascendant> hahahahaha 30x?
<doughnutjoe> User0 SO HARRRD COORE
<doughnutjoe> :D
<Espeon> 15x for the perk, doubles with the dark brotherhood gloves iirc
<Ascendant> nice
<Espeon> it kills everything but outright bosses in one hit
<User0> brony wristband and RD on my desk
<Ascendant> that's awesome
<Espeon> >tfw one-hit killing dragons
<doughnutjoe> User0 Your boss knows?
<Ascendant> XD
<User0> I don't know yet...
<DaemonLucius> how does one poni poni
<Espeon> it actually makes sense as it is really assassin-like at least
<Ascendant> yeah
<doughnutjoe> User0 You must tell him
<User0> I'm thinking about drawing ponies on the whiteboard of my cube
<Phase4> 00,02ders a game for a later stream
<Ascendant> the first dragon you see is pretty cool
<doughnutjoe> User0 Then you must convert him
<Ascendant> the beginning of the game is interesting as usual
*User0 nuzzles Phase4.
<Ascendant> >going to be executed
<Ascendant> >dragon saves
<Ascendant> HURR DURR
*Phase4 00,02hugs User0 back
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> dragon appears
<MasterBoss43> Phase4 Do you know why i got banned from the server?
<Ascendant> also Xeli, which faction did you join? rebels or empire?
<Phase4> 00,02stupid time zones
<Ascendant> ohgodstarwars
<Kammerjunk> DaemonLucius: Poni can poni poni with poni.
<Phase4> 00,024 hours till pyro update
<Phase4> 00,02its 12pm
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<doughnutjoe> HEY I SAW MY NAME! :)
<Phase4> 00,02am
<Espeon> hahaha and well
<Phase4> 00,0223:16 right now
<Espeon> i went with the rebels but the quest glitched on me and I went "okay I'll fix that when I'm done with all the other things"
<Lil_B> hi Sylandest :)
<Ascendant> Ah
<doughnutjoe> coool
<Espeon> I'm unable to not go"Oh look a place on my map I haven't visited yet, LETS VISIT IT"
<Sylandest> howdy, Lil_B! :) How are you today?
<Ascendant> I think I'm going to go with the empire
<Ascendant> lmfao
<doughnutjoe> my name is color purple
<Ascendant> the guy you see first
<Ascendant> he's cool
<Ascendant> so empire
<doughnutjoe> what does MTP mean?
<Sylandest> oooh, deus ex
<Ascendant> but kinda awkward when you're listener of DB + part of the legion
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> then again
<Lil_B> Sylandest good, I was just playing TF2 on the same server, but i got kicked for beeing afk while i was cleaning the dishes for 5min XD
<killerpony7733> Phase4 you good with some L4D2 maybe after some DX:HR?
<Ascendant> you were like, the hero/saviour of everything in oblivion and also the listener of the DB
<Phase4> 00,02when we left jensen he was being punched in the face
<Ascendant> So derp
<Phase4> 00,02we return to jensen being punched in the face
<Phase4> 00,02(i'm at the first boss)
<Sylandest> Lil_B: awww...that wasn't very nice! Return the favor and blow them up later! :D
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, too late for l4d2
<Sylandest> Phase4: good luck!
<Espeon> it's fun when you finish the quests for the db, all the guards go all "psst, I know who you are. pls don't kill me" when you pass them
<Phase4> 00,02rounds would go beyond when i need sleep
<killerpony7733> Phase4: ah alright :)
<Espeon> or "i heard of your... recent exploits. i'll stay quiet kthx" and that sort of comments.
<Espeon> which is kind of odd as I thought that was kind of supposed to be secret.
<killerpony7733> Fun fact you can win this fact by using all the gas canisters and explosive barrels here
<Espeon> BUT ANYWAY.
*Espeon stop, drop, flop.
<Sylandest> ouch...dat face punch
<User0> Oh, my package was delivered to my local fedex at 3:40am~
<killerpony7733> Phase4: use all gas canisters and explosive barrels
<Ascendant> XD
<Sylandest> aaand random pony
<doughnutjoe> ^^^
<Ascendant> Yeah that sounds hilarious
<doughnutjoe> i like his mane :3
<killerpony7733> ^^^^
<Kammerjunk> User0: How long have you been waiting for it to arrive?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: hiya
<Chrysalis> come on dont spoil how to win this
<User0> since Thursday
<Ascendant> but <3 dualwielding
<Kammerjunk> Howdy.
<Chrysalis> let him figure it out, thats half the fun
<killerpony7733> Dat fail jump
<doughnutjoe> ololollolol
<Ascendant> which system did you play Skyrim on?
<doughnutjoe> you got ounched in da face
<User0> I had a 15% off which would have expired in less than 3 minutes of when I ordered.
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02this is not working
<Espeon> ps3 because i overestimated the system requirements.
<Espeon> which works quite well despite a lot of people apparently having issues with it o3o
<Kammerjunk> User0: Oh, that's neat then. I'm expecting to wait for a month total for a Twi' themed necklace I ordered.
<Kammerjunk> Bloody oceans.
<Sylandest> that did not go as planned...
<Phase4> 00,02is there a way to cheat through these
<Phase4> 00,02this is not going to be fun
<User0> Kammerjunk: took 3 months for some crystals to ship from china...
<killerpony7733> Phase4: easy way is explosive crates and gas canisters
<Kammerjunk> Wow.
<killerpony7733> Phase4: throw the one gas at him then explosive
<doughnutjoe> Kammerjunk i live in the ocean ._.
<Kammerjunk> doughnutjoe: Like narwhals?
<doughnutjoe> Kammerjunk Causing a commotion
<Kammerjunk> I mean, seaponies obviously live in the sea, and narwhals live in the ocean.
<Ascendant> Ah
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: sea and ocean are the same thing one is just deeper
<MadSurge> DED
<Ascendant> Skyrim on PC
<Angel_Espeon> 13Someone was supposed to bring me money that they owe me on Monday, it's now Wednesday and this still hasn't happened
<Ascendant> Requires Steam
<Ascendant> -_-
<Kammerjunk> Well, seaponies can't live in the ocean, that's just silly.
<Ascendant> ._. AE
<doughnutjoe> Kammerjunk dem sea ponies
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate being blunt about things like this but I don't seem to have a choice >.>;
<RaveBrony> Oh yeah, good morning everypony! :)
<Ascendant> oh hell
<Sylandest> morning, RaveBrony
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Uhh theres actual canisters with gas there not grenades
<Phase4> 00,02my grenade disapeared
<Ascendant> I just realised why this program wasn't working
<Ascendant> I forgot to get it to execute the function I coded
<Ascendant> ._.
<doughnutjoe> RaveBrony Whats for breakfast?
<killerpony7733> I feel bad for phase all this getting facepunched
<RaveBrony> doughnutjoe: Muffins! :$
<Phase4> 00,02was working for a bit
<doughnutjoe> RaveBrony Whaaaaaa!?!
<Espeon> AE that sort of things you pretty much have to be blunt about.
<Flutterswag> hay
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Espeon> Otherwise it's quite easy for people to make use of it which is bad.
<doughnutjoe> RaveBrony why not doughnuts? :[
<Espeon> Of course, a reminder isn't even -blunt- :P
*User0 facenuzzles Phase4.

<RaveBrony> doughnutjoe: I dont haz the spare money either D:
<doughnutjoe> good night
<Angel_Espeon> 13He's normally the kind of person who remembers simple things like this, he even said himself that he'd bring it over on Monday
<doughnutjoe> RaveBrony come to my island
<Angel_Espeon> 13I let him know yesterday that he still owed me and I asked why I didn't receive it, but got no reply
<Flutterswag> 6_9
<Espeon> .-.
<doughnutjoe> RaveBrony my people will teach you the ways
<RaveBrony> :o
<doughnutjoe> RaveBrony ......yes
<killerpony7733> doughnutjoe: would that be ponies in some form or way?
<Angel_Espeon> 13The funny thing is I came to the conclusion that I don't even care what happens with this guy anymore~
<Angel_Espeon> 13as soon as I get that money I'm just gonna remove myself from this cuz it's not worth my time anymore :3
<doughnutjoe> killerpony7733 we have made peace with the pony folk

<doughnutjoe> killerpony7733 We now live together in the valley of peace and friendship
*doughnutjoe intense gaze into the distance
<Phase4> 00,02this is tedious
<doughnutjoe> +Phase4 You must defeat the white man for my people
<Espeon> That is quite often the way to go~
<killerpony7733> Phase4: when you stun him the first time get any type of gas canister and explosive thrown at him
<killerpony7733> Oh yay
<User0> Phase4: be glad that this isn't nethack or something - where you have to start all over if you die....
<killerpony7733> He did it! :O
<doughnutjoe> +Phase4 i will reward you with doughnuts
<doughnutjoe> Very good
<killerpony7733> Phase4: theres loot in this place too
<Angel_Espeon> 13On a completely unrelated note, there's a dood who works at the cafe who has a bit of an accent (which I somehow didn't notice at first) and sounds a bit like you
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's pretty awesome xD
*doughnutjoe gives +Phase4 doughnuts

<killerpony7733> Phase4: honestly don't get it bosses can be beaten very easily either way

<Phase4> 00,02k
<MadSurge> How's stuff FairysHuff?
<Sumica> 00,10where is the pants augmentations?
<killerpony7733> Sumica: good question
<killerpony7733> Phase4: keep a eye on the alpha beta and omega thing

<Phase4> 00,02PANTS!

*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<Phase4> 00,02i'm thinking about getting them
<Phase4> 00,02when money of course
<Bronysith> Should i be a soldier or biotic? Sumica what are your recomds? i remember enjoying soldier
<MadSurge> Sumica: I'm fine with pants, don't need that :D
<Sumica> 00,10Soldgier is good for outright run and gun
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: soldier is best if you really want all out firepower and biotic is tactical power use
<Sumica> 00,10but just think MadSurge you could be a tripod
<Sumica> 00,10boitics are OP as hell
<Bronysith> ◥▶◀◤ i dont want OP
<Sumica> 00,10like unless you play on insane where every thing is armored and or shielded bitocs tear shit up.
<Bronysith> hmm
<Bronysith> ill play Biotic. i already played soldier before
<Sumica> 00,10Infaltrater is fun.
<AgentKalim> Vanguard is best guard. Just sayin
<FairysHuff> Boobs
<Phase4> 00,02this isnt working
<killerpony7733> Phase4: redo it
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<FairysHuff> Phase4: If he comes up Omega or Alpha you use the tactic thats opposite that.
<Sumica> 00,10should have goten that pants augmentation
<killerpony7733> Phase4: keep a eye on the meters cause if you see what he is like alpha beta or omega you can use it to convince by pheromones
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not sure what omega/alpha/beta are
<AgentKalim> My pants are augmented
<Sumica> 00,10press spacbar to stank up the room
<TrixieBaconMuffin> go for the romance option
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<FairysHuff> Phase4: I would explain but I know I would make it overly complicated.

<killerpony7733> Phase4: i mean't go to jensens office now check the email then see
<FairysHuff> I'm keeping my mouth shut. Never know when I'll stupidly throw out a spoiler for this game.

<SirGanjalf> FunFact: Bobblehead in Sniper's van a reference to Civilian class from Team Fortress Classic
<Kammerjunk> Having seen the real one now, I strongly prefer the Pyro having rainbow-vision.
<MegaMoonShine> Well, that was fun. Bye dudes! :)

<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: I think the default is 25565 or something.
<Shizuka> 13oh yes i haven't changed that
<Dark_Horst> FairysHuff: this divide sits too deep for mere fanboys
<MadSurge> NOOO THE AD IS TELLING ME TO SHOOT 5 SCOTALOOS
<Shizuka> 13the reason you have to do the console connect is because it's a listen server
<Dark_Horst> FairysHuff: nobody listens to them
<FairysHuff> Dark_Horst: Aaaaah
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: And what's that mean?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/3838767/Meet+the+Pyro/
<Shizuka> 13meaning it's running off the same client i'm playing on
<EggWhite> A mistakeless life?
<FairysHuff> Question, how do I set up a seperate channel? This one seems to be flooded with game talk. I'd like to talk famous quotes.

<AttackWithHugs> alexxm: You're welcome.
<alexxm> zangief's a badguy
<Obsidian> Hey everypony
<legacyofvrak> I'm here with my friends
<flutter_spin> this movie is going to rock
<Lil_B> I want to see this movie :), will be the first movie i see since "THe Expendabels"
<legacyofvrak> Flut
<MahBoi777> hey Obsidian
<MahBoi777> ikr
<alexxm> hey Obsidian hows your day been
<Dark_Horst> okay. the ghost was funny :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lil_B: Heh, that film was epic
<legacyofvrak> flutter_spin: Don't you say... IT'S BADASS
<Obsidian> alexxm: Okay so far
<flutter_spin> I don't know. Brave was kind of disappointing. I can't say it for sure
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly I didn't like it XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> Aww, but I liked the OtT random violence D:
<flutter_spin> Candyland :P
<flutter_spin> yeahhhhh
<Very_Silly_Filly> 2's gonna be cool, Chuck Norris and Arnie are in it
<AgentKalim> What's up people, I'm back.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Arnie gets a bigger role
<Lil_B> I wonder how many references will be in this movie... I mean, we already see Q-Bert (older then 30years) to now
<Very_Silly_Filly> A robocop would be cool
<flutter_spin> uhhhh. I don't know what she is saying (because I'm eating) but it sounds...
<AgentKalim> Make ALL the oldschool vidya references.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Or monkey island
<Dark_Horst> i think i've seen that gun before
<Very_Silly_Filly> Monkey island would ROCK
<alexxm> Lil_B perhaps it'll be the rodger rabitt of video games
<flutter_spin> lol
<flutter_spin> wut?
<RyunosukeKnT> OH COME ON
<flutter_spin> uuuugh
<Dark_Horst> was that supposed to be a g11?
<flutter_spin> its one of those animes
<AgentKalim> If they make a Monkey Island reference, I'm totally going to go bananas. :P
<AgentKalim> What's this? I've seen these characters before, but I don't know what the show is. :P
<GabeDry> AgentKalim, Full Metal Panic
<Very_Silly_Filly> If they make a Monkey Island reference, I would offer to spend 500 quid on a commodore JUST to get Monkey Island
<AgentKalim> Ohhhhh
<AgentKalim> right
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly I hated the CGI in The expandables, they make awesome blood-effects without CGI since 50years... why use CGI that doesn't look nearly as good now?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Around 900 Quid for Americans
<RyunosukeKnT> that a-team reference music
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lil_B: Because they wanted it to be over the top silly
<AgentKalim> Lil_B: Because hurr durr, CGI for everything
<Shizuka> 13arena is teh laaaaame
<flutter_spin> Reference: Transformers
<Kammerjunk> Arena is for silly fillies.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I saw a cartoon on tele for the first time in like 5 years
<Dark_Horst> anyone else lagging?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Fuck me, so much bloody CGI
<flutter_spin> she has long legs
<alexxm> Very_Silly_Filly how was it
<Lil_B> Also:... I too want mine Monkey Island reference :) or a Empty Chainsaw/Fuel is on the Mars-Reference
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/homework-class-test-esl-english-is-the-worst.png
<Very_Silly_Filly> It was a modern version of Scooby Doo
<AgentKalim> Aw hell, I can't pay attention to subtitles and the chat at the same time. :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> The original was great
<Chains> Who pinged me?
<flutter_spin> whoa?
<Very_Silly_Filly> This crappy new version is full of CGI and it's well.. crapola
<Very_Silly_Filly> Brb
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: RUH ROH WAGGY

<AgentKalim> And why are they protecting the girl?

<CallofLukey> I just love Japanese animie
<GilDash> MadSurge: What's with the ":$" face all the time? :)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Vocals pronounciation are like italian though
<AgentKalim> Anime is japanese by definition
<AgentKalim> Just saiyan :P
<MadSurge> GilDash: I'm just happy to see people I know :D
<CallofLukey> Please hold while I go watch MLP.
<GilDash> MadSurge: That face means something entirely different around somepony like me. ;)
<CallofLukey> Bye everypony! See you later.
<flutter_spin> Oh and I figured out Sumica's OC in my third fic. She is going to be... 'sassy' :)
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly Italian Spanish and France are all closly releated to latin thats why they are so similar
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: Yep trust GilDash on that one

<Very_Silly_Filly> 'dat plot
<flutter_spin> I'm still working on the first one. I've been taking a break here while I eat.
<GilDash> MadSurge: I'm all open right now. :)
<flutterchu> i just saw meet the pyro dafuq
<flutter_spin> Just touching up on some details
<Very_Silly_Filly> I would write a fic sometime, but I'm not creative and I don't speak like normal people do
<flutter_spin> http://vapgames.deviantart.com/art/Luna-Scooting-310589414 hahahahhaa
<MadSurge> GilDash: I seriously wonder sometimes whether you're bi or not :D
<Sumica> 00,10treeed
<Lil_B> why do these robots need hair?
<flutterchu> that was the worst tirbute for anything
<Kammerjunk> Oh noes.
<Sumica> 00,10rule of cool
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: That should be obvious silly filly :D
<Freefall29> hello everypony :)

<flutter_spin> Whenever my boss gets upset over something I messed up I say "Get Messy, Make Mistakes!"
<AgentKalim> So I just watched Meet the Pyro. Like, right now.
<AgentKalim> And it's SO GOOOD
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly well, I guess you could argue for additional Armor in the chest area, ut i get your poiint XD
<Freefall29> AgentKalim: it was ok
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lil_B: Yeah, but people tend to go for kevlar and plasmatic quantum field
<Sumica> 00,10curved armor is better at defelcting a shot
<MadSurge> He's got a shield!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Well, I do anyway
<AgentKalim> Freefall29: I guess I just like that sort of thing. :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Protects me from 10000 hp of damage
<Lil_B> Sumica yes, for more than 1 reason
<flutter_spin> he has turned blue!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Speaking of damage
<Freefall29> I mean, it was a little short, maybe how awesome meet the medic was, meet the pyro was impossible to live up to
<Very_Silly_Filly> Guess what my bastard niece did to me earlier today
<AgentKalim> Fair enough.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I was sat down, and she dived on me
<flutter_spin> Torpedo 2!
<Freefall29> the pyro is scary. He may not even be aware he is a monster.
<Very_Silly_Filly> She tried to climb up, and bloody kneed me where it hurts D:
<Dumori> pointy/angled hard armor is even better than curved in most cases
<alexxm> this should be a good fight
<Lil_B> why am i browsing throu Faust's Favourits on DA Òó ?
<GilDash> I just heard JENOVA in that song. :S
<flutter_spin> lol
<Freefall29> what are we even playing?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I like my kevlar and plasmatic quantum fields
