<cachi01> RAWRity: yeah i liek opera i use it for mah wii and movile devices :3
<CupcakeWarrior> I only used Opera because it was the Wii browser
<FlootahShy> I used Opera for awile. Then Firefox took me over.

<Pinkies4thWall> TheRainbowDash: you're not the only one
<TheRainbowDash> I'm refreshing it, but it doesn't seem to work either.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Polydunami: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ultimate-brony-challenge.png

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> |Discord|: Dream of Ponies
<MahBoi777> gnight |Discord|
<hen3ry> cachi01 well nothing seems to have changed on the network itself so it's probably just your program. A reboot should fix it
<cachi01> bye |Discord|!
<TheRainbowDash> Biglaw: That won't end well.:D
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Cya |Discord|.
<Sylandest> panda: but of course *bows* I do have my moments :)

<panda> Wrek is SLEEP! dont wake him... he is angry when he is cranky!
<Gamer_Luna> The stram is derping 6_9
<Algol> so if we're in distress

<Polydunami> Anyway, Ninjazz|Challenge, I was busy over the weekend and had no computer to return to
<Kosoveon> !ping
<drf|away> !pong
<hen3ry> the seaponies are really bad at tech support, I've found.
<owlicious> call upon the sea ponies, when you're in distress,
<TheRainbowDash> owlicious: Nah, forget them
*Pinkies4thWall will not join in the pinging of mods in such a manner
*Polydunami casts a spell on the video's issues
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Ahhh, no wonder, Polydunami. good to see you back, though, :)
<panda> owlicious: well.... i did and im in the middle of land... and they didnt come
<Reikim> Great, now I'm imagining sea pony tech support.

<Sylandest> all ponies in chat: If anypony has a message for ninjazz while he's doing the challenge, please divert them to me
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> (Jet Engine Souns)
<Kencolt> The seaponies don't have any computer-- or any electronic tech skills at all. Because they live under WATER. Makes it really really difficult. They can't even use a toaster. With or without socks.
<owlicious> When you feel like you're sinking fast, when you're cast adrift
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> sounds*
*Pinkies4thWall likes jet engines
<Om> Ninjazz|Challenge Sylandest: No

<cowvarkian> wait, theres a god now, Reikim ?

<DJMidgetBrony> Da fuck....
<hen3ry> True story: My uncle had a jar of bull testes near the front door. Always made a point to show it to anyone dating either of his daughters, and left off the bit where the balls came from bulls.
<MahBoi777> Spectrum_Rush: sorry, I just ate
*Pinkies4thWall actually loves chocolate milk. Specifically Tromoo
<Pinkies4thWall> *trumoo
<Reikim> panda: Or gives them even worse fates. Depending on the god in question, of course.
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: O U
<DJMidgetBrony> Whos been using my OC's pony name on here >_>
<panda> Pinkies4thWall: oh my.... trumoo?
<Kandarihu> Wow. I just checked to see if Eddie Izzard is going on, and caught it on the best possible frame for this. It's like INB4 Keyframe.
<panda> Reikim: true :D
<Gamer_Luna> not me
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Not I said the truthful liar
<Reikim> hen3ry: See, when my sister wanted to date, my father made a point of showing off his knife skills. Cut a piece of steak so thin you can see through it...
<Kandarihu> hen3ry: that's a good idea.
<Polydunami> I wonder what movies are being streamed next week... ?
<Derpy_Hooves> http://imgur.com/gallery/KZvcB
<cowvarkian> is that a threat on his part, Reikim ?
<Pinkies4thWall> EVERYPONY! Favorite discorded Mane 6. GO!
<TheRainbowDash> Hay, is anyone's stream is derping?
<Ponies47> Discord can't get me. I can't be turned evil! :)
<Reikim> cowvarkian: nah, he just liked making steak.
<panda> Pinkies4thWall: greedity :D
<Marx> I'm going to bed. Hope the video stops derping.
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: i believe all of ours are
<CupcakeWarrior> Derpy_Hooves: KITTEH
<cowvarkian> ah, ok Reikim
<Polydunami> TheRainbowDash, is that you?
<hen3ry> It's not legally a threat if you're not actually saying you're going to do it to somepony. It's just a gulp-inducing implication.
<Twi_Fi> TheRainbowDash: Nope
<Gamer_Luna> TheRainbowDash: eeeyup
<TheRainbowDash> Polydunami: Yes, this is me.
<Pinkies4thWall> Mine is Liarjack
<Polydunami> It's been a while; I haven't been on lately
<Kimori> Still though it sounds like your doing very well :)
<cowvarkian> wait, TheRainbowDash you're eddie izzard?

<cowvarkian> kirz, tis a lie
<cachi01> thx hen3ry it worked =D!
<Polydunami> Anyway, TheRainbowDash, the problem isn't with the stream itself but the video being played
<Polydunami> Rather, the video encoding is corrupt, I guess
<hen3ry> cachi01: no prob. software derps usually fixed that way 99% of the time
<TheRainbowDash> Polydunami: Oh, really? Didn't know that the video was messing up, and not the streamer itself.
<Ponies47> I have never heard of either of the movies :P
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Polydunami> Well, the subtitles are working fine
<Gamer_Luna> Type in the best couple on this CHAT,not the stream. :)
<panda> Ponies47: leon the professional is the SHIT!
<hen3ry> best couple in this chat? Not Applicable.
<Pinkies4thWall> Polydunami: half of them at least
<Spyrorocks> meh always could do better
<CupcakeWarrior> Gamer_Luna: Shizuka x Vivi is best couple

<Saturn> 08,01panda: yes
<hen3ry> Polydunami: wait I thought you broke up with sanity :D
<panda> Ponies47: i was born in 90 but i didnt find the movie till about 2002
<CrimsonPhoenix> This is a trope in Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 episode "Praying to Celestia that it is merely coincidence, but another background pony strongly resembles a certain pony from a certain MLP game that is not suitable for younger audiences. "
<CrimsonPhoenix> But I cannot get the reference
<panda> Saturn: I would totally.. but... this distance....
<Polydunami> Polydunami never went anywhere with sanity :3
*DeathStar dances

<Reikim> Saturn: Should we sing you a lullaby in pings? 'Cause you need sleep, man.
<panda> Saturn: maybe ill take a vaccation when im done with school here ^^
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: and which game?
<Polydunami> Ponies47, it's not the stream, it's the video itself
<DeathStar> hen3ry: it's just not ment to be
<CrimsonPhoenix> It doesn't say
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: i've been up for about 24 hours straight now

<hen3ry> Saturn: unless they changed things, you can sorta +m individual users. By +b ing them.
<GabeMoist> Saturn, wouldn't muting individual users be kicking them
<Sylandest> Pinkies4thWall: :D
<Saturn> 08,01shizu ninja'd me
<hen3ry> Saturn: +b without kick is an individual +m
<twilight_sprinkle> matlab=matrix laboratory

<Shizuka> 13if you aren't seeing matrix rifftrax, refresh
<cachi01> wow how many disk drives do you have Shizuka?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Saw the derpy video on youtube and had to find the site

<Shizuka> 13cachi01: technically, two
<Shizuka> 13rei is partitioned into three though
<hen3ry> yay
<Sylandest> Pinkies4thWall: hehe
<Polydunami> Big_Macintosh_1992, are you new here? Welcome to bronystate then!
<Kandarihu> Funny how they started out riffing bad movies. Now that they're clear of copyright entanglements, they're free to riff GOOD movies.
<Reikim> Shizuka: ...You named your drives?
<Shizuka> 13ofc
<Big_Macintosh_1992> yeah, just found it
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: there's no shame in objecting

<Life_Essence> welcom to Sumerpan
<TheRainbowDash> Well, still haven't got the plot of this...
<Tov|Christmas> I've never a stretched copy of this on the internets

<Ponies47> Big_Macintosh_1992: Welcome to the bronystate herd! :)

<CupcakeWarrior> Night kirz
<Saturn> 08,01why is his voice sometimes screwed up?
*Spectrum_Rush le kick
<Shizuka> 13and the riff is a little unbalanced
<Life_Essence> cya ceilingkirz

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Big_Macintosh_1992: Welcome to Bronystate

<Big_Macintosh_1992> thanks
<Kandarihu> This is going to be FULL of computer maintenance jokes, isn't it?
<Ponies47> Hush now quiet now quiet now ceilingKirz it's time to lay your sleepy head :)
<cachi01> run they r trying to fix ur computer!
<TheRainbowDash> Big_Macintosh_1992: So, you're completely new here on Bronystate? Like your first day?
<Shizuka> 13problem is that's done at the expense of being able to stretch a video from its stored format
<Pinkies4thWall> Kandarihu: most likely
<Big_Macintosh_1992> yes, first day
<Reikim> Well, as much as I'd absolutely love to be up until 2 in the morning, but I actually have to be up tomorrow. Or, later today.

<TheRainbowDash> Rifftrax is?
<Shizuka> 13TheRainbowDash: Michael J Nelson and Kevin Murphy, rifftrax
<Shizuka> 13bill isn't on this one

<Spectrum_Rush> ribs? chichiron/
<Kandarihu> RainbowcrashNBurn: MST3K had a status quo where they could ONLY do bad movies. Rifftrax has no internal continuity or status quo or characterization. It's just 3 people poking fun at the movie. So they riff what they like.

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> takes blue pilll, cue credits
<GabeMoist> And then Neo took both

<hen3ry> there is no elevator
<Malavolent> Sumica: They don't go BOOM in slow-mo?
<Darkts3> Derp
<Eddmario> I think Gen 5 of Pokemon might be the only gen that I don't beat the storyline off.
<Tov|Christmas> I haven't seen Borat in like 6 years
<Darkts3> lol random guy with a knife
<Darkts3> xD
<oni_link> I thought Borat was freakin hillarious
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames and explodes

<Sylandest> Polydunami: not quite what you were hoping for :P
<DuskStarshimmer> dat deale
<MahBoi777> Oh No!
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: yus
<Kandarihu> I notice that when the movie is quiet, I can't hear the dialog over the riffing. When the movie is loud, I can't hear the riffing over the movie. And this is an avi, so fixing the audio at this point is impossible.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> shes goin down
<Polydunami> Meh, just making a slight joke
<Sylandest> hehehe
<oni_link> Eddmario: I dislike Diet... too sweet for me XP
<Shizuberry> 13like i said at the start Kandarihu

*DuskStarshimmer dances
<Kandarihu> Okay. I didn't catch that at the beginning.
<Shizuberry> 13but i would appreciate if you didn't complain about every single thing we stream...
<TheRandomkid321> If that was me on BF3 I would have missed it by an inch... IT ALWAYS HAPPENS~
<Shizuberry> 13because you do..
<Sumica> 00,10you must have a weak audio program then Kandarihu
<Eddmario> The only problem have with the Matrix full series 2 disc dvd set is the animatrix actually repeats one of the storylines
<MahBoi777> Gamer_Luna: no don do that
<Kandarihu> Terribly sorry.
<OtakuTom> Man...I just HAD to miss basicaly the entirety of the movie/riff...granted, I think I have this riff...lol
<DuskStarshimmer> dafaq just happend?
<MahBoi777> why does the helicopter always have to crash??
<Eddmario> Dat ass...
<Tov|Christmas> I had problems with the audio too. I'm listening to my own copy of this Rifftrax
<Shizuberry> 13DuskStarshimmer: trinity did a GTA
<Shizuberry> 13crashed her vehicle
<Tov|Christmas> *watching*
<Polydunami> That helicopter did a Super Mario 64
<Kencolt> Eddmario: Which was part of the point of The Animatrix.
<DuskStarshimmer> Hia Shizuberry
<Kandarihu> I'm sorry about that. I feel like I'm about to become a lot more sorrier.
<Sylandest> MahBoi777: its a required law of fiction. Have a good vehicle? We have to trash it
<Shizuberry> 13Sylandest: heh yeah, just look at the bourne series
<Shizuberry> 13they make cars cry
<TheRandomkid321> WAsnt morphius shot? He seems pretty good currently

<Sylandest> Shizuberry: eeyup. Lots of fiction rules you pick up on in writing, lol
<OtakuTom> Then, of course, there's the Michael Bay law..."Have something? Blow it up!"
<Eddmario> No, I mean that since the DVD version of i has each story as a different scene, one of them will play itself back-to-back unless you do some messing around with the remote
<oni_link> Tov|Christmas: Im waiting for Black and White 2 ... I want i naaaaooooowww!! http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/3Azz-6oT08c/hqdefault.jpg

<RainbowcrashNBurn> lol

<RainbowcrashNBurn> Tov|Christmas: maybe they may eventually release a grey version where Reshiram Zekrom and kyurem are ALL combined into their original form
<Espeon> o.o!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> heres my handle
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> heres my spout
<Polydunami> Here... is my spout
<Polydunami> Wait
<geeky-brony> Gamer_Luna: no
<DuskStarshimmer> another health bar? of couse, it is a boss fight
<Tov|Christmas> A Electic/Ice/Fire/Dragon Type
<Polydunami> When I get all steamed up... HEAR ME SHOUT
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: don't be so modest lol
<Gamer_Luna> geeky-brony: YUP! :)
<Kencolt> And oddly enough, a properly partly chewed fruit roll up can look exactly like blood. Um. Please do not ask me how I know that.
<ChimeraReiax> :3c
<Kandarihu> So, will B/W 2 be G6 or the extension to G5?
<Shizuberry> 13Tov|Christmas: an electric/fire/ice/dragon/goo/monkey type?
<Shizuberry> 13with a hint of lemon
<geeky-brony> MahBoi777: Gamer_Luna now im blushing
<Eddmario> Matrix 3 spoiler: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET: Neo and Trinity both die
<Polydunami> TIP! ME! OVER! AND POUR! ME! OUT!
<Kandarihu> Oh, I suppose it's too soon for G6
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kandarihu, extension to G5 I believe
<Sumica> 00,10you are waiting on a train neo.
<GabeMoist> choo choo
<Tov|Christmas> I wouldn't mind seeing something like that as a videogame boss in pokemon.
<OtakuTom> B/W 2 are still part of G5.
<CrimsonPhoenix> why would it be G6
<Shizuberry> 13dat sumica <3
<oni_link> RainbowcrashNBurn: i knew they were all one originally!! i need to bitchslap my freinds, they argued with me saying i was full of it
<Polydunami> You're waiting for a train
<Polydunami> A train that will take you far away
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> sound like the screeching of brakes
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> Sumica they are supposed to that was asmall plothole
<MahBoi777> inb4 I like trains
<Kandarihu> Okay. Sorry for asking a stupid question.
<DuskStarshimmer> I liek trains
<hen3ry> Neo Sporin
<Polydunami> You know where you hope this train will take you...
<Tov|Christmas> G6 would be a true 3DS game with new pokemon.
<Malavolent> That agent really is an idiot, isn't he.
<OtakuTom> G6 will most likely be for the 3DS and will feature another new region and new pokemon.
<Polydunami> But you---
<Shizuberry> 13oh....
<geeky-brony> epic jump is epic
<iheartribs> hi im new here
<DerpSurge> OH MY GOD. Bronystate's streams are all week now? Goodbye social life.
*Shizuberry 13just realized you guys are talking about pokemon...
<DuskStarshimmer> iheartribs, Allo!
<Kencolt> whatthese guys SHOULD have made is a Ranma 1/2 movie.
<Pinkies4thWall> :D dat Shizuberry
<Malavolent> He can't shot Neo along with Neo shooting him, but it's perfectly okay for them both to get hit by train.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> welcome iheartribs
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> Ninjazz|Challenge: newbie you know what to do
<Sumica> 00,10yeah took me a bit too Shizuberry
<Tov|Christmas> Because Larry Wachowski is now a girl?
<Shizuberry> 13i was wondering why you were waiting for black and white 2 when... that came out in like 2004
<hen3ry> bah to Ranma 1/2..
<oni_link> Tov|Christmas: was it wrong to drool over that thought??
<DuskStarshimmer> I only display my data is vertial strings of binary
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Spectrum_Rush|Draws: Point at him for me!
<OtakuTom> lol
<RainbowcrashNBurn> oni_link: lol, but yeh Kyurem is what was left after Reshiram and Zekrom originally split way back in the mythology backstory to B/W
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> Ninjazz|Challenge: iheartribs
<Kandarihu> LOL
<Pinkies4thWall> OSHIT i'm about to lose the net
<Pinkies4thWall> BYE GUYS
<Polydunami> Kencolt, it makes sense considering the transgendered identity of one of the Wachowskis
<GabeMoist> Silly Shizuka

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Pinkies4thWall: Dream of Ponies
<Rain> bye Pinkies4thWall

<geeky-brony> lol
<Shizuberry> 13time for one big homage to ghost in the shell
<Tov|Christmas> drooling over Gen 6?
<Ponies47> Anthor new comer :o
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Welcome Welcoem Welceme, iheartribs! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E

<MahBoi777> welcome iheartribs!

<oni_link> RainbowcrashNBurn: ahh now i get it
<OtakuTom> Yea, any time I see this scene, I can't help but think of GITS
<Ponies47> Welcome iheartribs :)
<MahBoi777> bye Pinkies4thWall!
<Malavolent> Not the melons!
*DuskStarshimmer glomps iheartribs
<CrimsonPhoenix> I STILL need to watch Ghost in the shell...
<Sumica> 00,10my cabbages!
*geeky-brony hugs Gamer_Luna
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol door
<Tov|Christmas> hopefully G6 wont have 10 year old graphics.
<Shizuberry> 13honestly i didn't like the original movie having watched SAC
<OtakuTom> All Agent Smith needs now is the ability to turn invisible and beat the crap out of Neo to prevent the 2nd and 3rd movies.
<Gamer_Luna> :)
<Shizuberry> 13felt very very slow paced
<iheartribs> :) thanks for the greeting
<geeky-brony> :)
<DerpSurge> Hi people, how are you? I'm still doozy, just woke up!
<Polydunami> Don't really give a damn about graphics
<Kandarihu> I only watched SAC
<Sylandest> DerpSurge: howdy!
<Malavolent> Nice cam work here.
<MahBoi777> hey DerpSurge!
<geeky-brony> hello iheartribs welcom
<DuskStarshimmer> Heroic jump is heroic
<dalekkahn> Which ghost in the shell was streamed here?
<Kencolt> Shizuberry: It was something of the art film, true.
<Eddmario> Technically, I didn't spoil this movie
<Polydunami> When I see good graphics, I get skeptical about the quality of the gameplay :|
<Tov|Christmas> Second and Third movies have some of the best Rifftrax. I'm glad they exist.
<Kencolt> Shizuberry: Just with guns.
<OtakuTom> Same here, Poly
<MahBoi777> ALIENZ
<Polydunami> Hey there DerpSurge :3
<DuskStarshimmer> Why not zoidberg?
<Shizuberry> 13oh yes, reloaded and revolutions are much better :3
<Shizuberry> 13mostly cause they have all three riffers :3
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> someone ping me when neo gets to the phone
<DuskStarshimmer> I cant whatch this move for the plot
<Tov|Christmas> Both of them have Mike, Kevin and Bill in them
<oni_link> that moment when you freak out cause your laptop is dying and you cant find the cable -_-
<OtakuTom> Gameplay and story (when there is one) are way more important to me than graphics.
<Polydunami> Indeed
<DerpSurge> Hey, are these the MST3K doing rifftraxes? :D YAY
<hen3ry> they get more bullets every time they change bodies, apparently
<Shizuberry> 13there does sometimes feel like something is missing when one of them isn't on the riff
<Shizuberry> 13bill on this one, mike on day after tomorrow, kevin on xmen
<DuskStarshimmer> What?
<MahBoi777> go Neil Go
<Kandarihu> oni_link: I have yet to have a moment like that. But if that happens to me, sleep mode is preferable to losing everything I had open.
<DerpSurge> Single button
<OtakuTom> I like the riffs where they bring in special guests, like Weird Al for Jurassic Park, or Jonathan Coulton and Paul & Storm for Tron.
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> at that range one shots enough
<Tov|Christmas> It a little off with Crow T Robots naturally high-pitched voice.
<TheRainbowDash> Missing a lot.:D
<DerpSurge> MISSED
<MahBoi777> that washis last life GAME OVER
<iheartribs> lolz
<Darkts3> he missed
<DerpSurge> :D
<DuskStarshimmer> ded
<Shizuberry> 13my tron riff has serious desync issues.. probably need to try and reacquire it
<Polydunami> Time for hax
<Malavolent> Insert coin for new game.
<iheartribs> i think he is ok
<hen3ry> Need the Mario ded song to play
<Polydunami> What's my high score?
<Ponies47> MISSED ME! :D
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> Shizuberry: original or legacy?
<Shizuberry> 13original
*Tov|Christmas tries to decide if Twilight New Moon or Transformers 3 is his favorite Rifftrax.
<oni_link> Kandarihu: well i have a used 08 macbook with horrible battery life :[
<Shizuberry> 13they haven't done legacy
<geeky-brony> Ponies47: yes
<dalekkahn> Tron riff would make me love you even more shizu
<OtakuTom> Yea, they haven't riffed Legacy (yet)
<oni_link> i rage cause of my battery
<iheartribs> can this be the end
<Ponies47> geeky-brony: dawwww :(
<DuskStarshimmer> love is resurection?
<Shizuberry> 13i want to see them do twister
<Shizuberry> 13i would be so crazy happy
*geeky-brony hugd Ponies47
<iheartribs> plot twist
<OtakuTom> I could have sworn they did Twister...
<Polydunami> I want to see a riff on Chronicle
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> Shizuberry: someon said they did yesterday
<hen3ry> turns out, you're a necrophiliac
*Tov|Christmas thinks of the Rifftrax that had Korra doing the riffs.
<Ponies47> *Hugs geeky-brony*
*OtakuTom goes to the Rifftrax site now
<Darkts3> WHOAAA
<Kencolt> OK. Because this dialog makes TOTAL sense, because.. umm... No, he's right. TOTAL logical fallacy.
*MahBoi777 inserts coin
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> kiss of life
<Darkts3> magic
<geeky-brony> Spectrum_Rush|Draws:
<Polydunami> Continue?
<Ponies47> Now kiss :)

<Ponies47> magic *snort* *snort*
<Sumica> 00,10so acording to the math. inorder to fall 30feet and not be hurt you would have to be wraped in 50 feet of bubblewrap
<MahBoi777> ewwwww
<Tov|Christmas> Roadhouse reference.
<Shizuberry> 13neat
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> "Okay, whose next?"
<Kencolt> Hi. I'm Neo. And I'm also a severe skin disease.

<OtakuTom> Ooooh...they're doing a live riff of Manos: The Hands of Fate in August.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Robotic Welding Squid

<Polydunami> It's about twenty to midnight here
<Shizuberry> 13but wait
<Espeon> I feel bad for you :(
<oni_link> no problem ;)
<Kencolt> OtakuTom: Well, the wprld is supposed to end in December, so they kind of have to get it out of the way.
<Shizuberry> 13if you fall 30 feet while wrapped in 50 feet...
<Shizuberry> 13you don't fall...
<DerpSurge> The ennnnnnnd...? D'oh!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> suffocate yourself in bubblewrap, survive a fall from 30feer
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> feet*
<GabeMoist> Dun dun duuuuuun
<Kandarihu> OtakuTom: that's awesome.
<Malavolent> Shizuberry: Who would have tell?
<geeky-brony> Shizuberry: omg
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Shizuberry: you would fall up with that logic?
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> Paladin_Drakkenwolf: like abaws

<Rain> Sumica, it means 30 ft from the bottom of the wrap >_>
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> oh yeah.... if youre wrapped with 50 feet of bubble wrap for a 30 foot falll youd go up 20 feet
<CrimsonPhoenix> that song
<Sylandest> Now, everypony! Walk out dramatically! Wherever you are!

<CrimsonPhoenix> DuskStarshimmer, You don't know about the Matrix?
<Spectrum_Rush|Draws> Sumica: Shizuberry 50 feet is the length of buble wrap but it'd be wraped around you so it would take up a less space

<DuskStarshimmer> ninja_pony just enter their name in chat, tab is usually a autocompletel key
<Guava_Luna> ninja_pony: Well,I came here one day and I started posting pictures I had drawn oh here.One Pony,named Irish_Pony,typed in that he hugged me for being awesome.I felt a bit warm inside since that.When I said I'd have to leave for a while,he said he'll miss me.I fell for him right away and started drawing our OCs together.Then we talked and talked on here and he said he loved me,so I said it too.Now we're the best couple ever <3

<Ninjazz|Challenge> You did not just insult Linux infront of Phase4.
<Darkts3> woo fallout music
<Rain> sudden stream made me jump out of my skin
<TheRandomkid321> Darkts3 You mean 50s music?
<Kandarihu> Well, MacOS and Linux are both based on Unix.

<DerpSurge> Fuck yeah pyro!
<SirGanjalf> Anyone knows when is Valve's E3 conference starting?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> dat mic spam
<Rain> >fallout music
<Kammerjunk> Cole Porter is awesome.
*CrazyCherry curls and rolls around like a goran.
<geeky-brony> awesome
<Rain> Im dissapoint, geeky-brony
<TheRandomkid321> I am sick of people saying 50s music is fallout music.
<Kandarihu> I don't really feel like going into the differences.
<HeavyMetalDash> so I bid the farewell be back soon bai
<geeky-brony> Rain: waht
<Kammerjunk> Rain: I know, right.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> phase is streaming ?
<geeky-brony> Rain: im sarry what i do
<Rain> geeky-brony, you called this fallout music

<Ponies47> Ok I'm sane now. I've brushed my amne and I feel much better that now all that evil fruit is gone :)
<geeky-brony> Rain: it plays on galxy new radio in fall out 3

<Kammerjunk> TheRandomkid321: F3.
<Rain> geeky-brony, doesnt mean it is music that came from fallout
<geeky-brony> Rain: i know
<TheRandomkid321> Kammerjunk still played fo3 and never heared it
<SirGanjalf> Playing as Pyro equipped in this(http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=73814273) set, while micspamming Fallout soundtrack - priceless.
<Rain> those songs are much older than fallout
<Darkts3> we all know that

<Kammerjunk> TheRandomkid321: It comes on GNR every once in a while.

<OneTrickPony> XD
<Kammerjunk> SirGanjalf: I approve this loadout.
<geeky-brony> lol
<DerpSurge> POW, hahaa
<Kandarihu> You know what? I just noticed that the Fallout games take place 200 years after a nuclear holocaust in the 1950s, and the interfaces and music still hearken to the pop culture at the time the nukes happened. So nobody living in the vaults made new music?
<MrSnugglewoods> need a dispenser here!

<geeky-brony> fluter shy
<TheRandomkid321> Chat Derped?
<geeky-brony> lol
<Kandarihu> A science fiction series I'm working on also involves humanity sealed in artificial environments for hundreds of years. And in the aftermath, the musical aesthetic is one that's created BY the people who were sealed off... but even millenia after the fact because they keep the memory alive in their collective consciousness.
<DerpSurge> TheRandomkid321: people randomly get pony models with different stats
<TheRandomkid321> DeepSure... Okay then
<Kammerjunk> So Missus R, with all her trimmings, can broadcast a bed from Simmons, 'cause Franklin knows anything goes.
<Kandarihu> It's just that the music evolves over the course of the solitude. And then afterwards, the music from that time becomes traditional folksongs.
<Kandarihu> It even becomes ancient traditional songs eventually.
<geeky-brony> im a go night evry pony
<Kandarihu> This looks like one awesome server.

<doughnutjoe> 	 ಠ_ಠ
<Pale_Horse> I heard it was a stroke.
<RaveBrony> Aw damn >.<
<Twi_Fi> :(
<CrazyCherry> Blarghh.
<Pale_Horse> Why do ponies and TF2 mix so well?
<trollhunter> nopony knows
<Twi_Fi> If it were not for TF2 I may not have checked out MLP.
<Pale_Horse> It's like a natural synergy.
<Twi_Fi> Because of that one youtube vid....
<Twi_Fi> Let me see if I can find it.
<trollhunter> witch vid?
<Pale_Horse> Equestria! BUCK YEAH!
<trollhunter> lol
<Twi_Fi> Can I post the link during a stream?
<Pale_Horse> That Rarity is a Spy!
*Twi_Fi looks at stream.
<Twi_Fi> For some reason I got into watching a bunch of TF2 vids on youtube.
<Twi_Fi> Which led me to one with ponies.
<Twi_Fi> And I was confused.
<doughnutjoe> ^
<Twi_Fi> That vid led me to watch pony related vids.
<Twi_Fi> The youtube poop pony vids.
<|Discord|> Hai everypony!
<Twi_Fi> Hello |Discord|
<doughnutjoe> Welcome back
<Pale_Horse> I think it was simple idle curiousity that got me into MLP.
<trollhunter> hi
<doughnutjoe> i think
<Twi_Fi> I came across a vid of Pinkie Pie being crazy with straight hair.
<|Discord|> trollhunter: You catch any trolls latly?
<Twi_Fi> And I was like, "Why is the usually happy pony acting like this?"
<Pale_Horse> I couldn't help hearing people debating what the attraction was that was getting so many grown people into a kids TV show.
<Twi_Fi> Which caused me to watch the episodes.
<Pale_Horse> So I went to the MLP wiki and started looking at all the info there
<Twi_Fi> And the rest is history!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Pale_Horse> and then I started watching the PMV's
<RaveBrony> time to go everypon! Ill bbl today! :)
<Pale_Horse> ...and reading the fanfics...
<trollhunter> naaa busness is a bit slow
<Pale_Horse> ...and then watching the show itself. :P
<Pale_Horse> Then eventually i wound up here. :D
<Phase4> i'm getting a bit bored of tf2
<Pale_Horse> Play Saints Row the Third.
<trollhunter> when will the feed change

<Pale_Horse> Suddenly death.
<ninja_pony> alexxm: i heard a book of chocolate can fix allmost anything tri that lol
<ninja_pony> box
<Pale_Horse> Wait wait... You might be onto something with that chocolate book idea there. :O
*alexxm gives Twi_Fi a box of chocolate i'm sorry
<Saturn> hullo again
<Pale_Horse> A chocolate book would be bothe entertaining AND delicious! :)
<alexxm> hey Saturn hows your day been
<Saturn> does anyone not know what a planetary solar transit is?
<ninja_pony> Pale_Horse: u and me CHOCOLATE BOOK ENTERPRISE ???
<alexxm> i don't Saturn
<Pale_Horse> YES! I am so in! :D
<ninja_pony> lol :D
<Saturn> like, if i say "the transit of venus", do you all know what i mean?
<alexxm> nope Saturn
<Saturn> okay, i'll explain
<Twi_Fi> Saturn: Like an eclipse?
<Saturn> it's really simple; just astro terminology
<Saturn> Twi_Fi: kinda
<Saturn> it's when a planet passes between us and the sun
<Pale_Horse> Think about it. You read a gripping installment of The Wheel OF Time, or Game of Thrones... and when you're done.. YOU EAT IT! ;)
<Saturn> so you can see it sillouetted against the sun
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: You are forgiven.
<ninja_pony> like the shadow of earth on teh moon like right now i think ?
<Saturn> obviously, this only happens with the inner planets
<Saturn> mercury and venus
<alexxm> so sort of like a eclipse then Saturn
<Saturn> alexxm: yeah, except with a planet
<Saturn> and therefore the visual is TINY
<alexxm> how often does it happen then Saturn
<Saturn> you see this little dark speck go across the sun
<dishwasher_EXTREME> hey guys
<Saturn> alexxm: good question, and that's what i actually came on to talk about
<Pale_Horse> The books could come in all sorts of varieties too. Orange chocolate books. Toffee chocolate books. Mint Chocolate books. The possibilities are almost endless! :O
<Saturn> because it doesn't happen very often
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Espeon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- WE FULLFILL EACHOTHER
<alexxm> hey dishwasher_EXTREME hows your day been
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Espeon03)02WB* - * Espeon humps Umbreon <Espeon> *bumps <Espeon> Ahjdahsdsad <Espeon> WTF
<dishwasher_EXTREME> good
<Saturn> the next transit of venus is in 2 days
<Starflash> Wot
<Saturn> and it doesn't happen again for over 100 years
<Saturn> 2117, to be precise
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ?
<Saturn> so this will be pretty much your only chance to ever see it
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn eclipse?
<Saturn> dishwasher_EXTREME: transit of venus
<Pale_Horse> And now i'm caramelldansen...6_9
<ninja_pony> Saturn: i just had a look thats COOL
<Monfang> I hate that map
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn and how are we suppose to see it
<alexxm> thats cool Saturn
<Monfang> It's designed for CP, not CTF
<Saturn> so if you want to see it, get yourself some appropriate eyewear
<Saturn> or a telescope WITH A SOLAR FILTER
<Saturn> never look at the sun through a telescope, unless you have a solar filter
<Starflash> naw, use telescopes to look at suns like a baws... a blind baws
<Saturn> or you will go blind
<ninja_pony> ooooh im in AUS so its night here the moon is just slowly disapearing lol
<Saturn> your eyes will melt
<Twi_Fi> Hello dishwasher_EXTREME
<Pale_Horse> Pfft. REAL men don't need working eyesight... :|
<dishwasher_EXTREME> the milky way galaxy is goin to crash into another galaxy in 4 billion year.....trouble is we all be ded so we cant see them:(
<Saturn> and yes, i give this warning because i know someone who was stupid enough to do that
<Starflash> Saturn... ouch :<
<Saturn> dishwasher_EXTREME: that's right; the Andromeda galaxy
<ninja_pony> Saturn: are u srs? lol
<Saturn> i wish i could be alive to see that
<Saturn> it'd be a beautiful sight
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn we would be ded then too lol mabey
<Saturn> over the course of thousands of years, you'd see the andromeda galaxy get bigger in the sky
<alexxm> Saturn wouldn't we all die if we were ariund for that
<Pale_Horse> Cant. Stop. Caramelldansen... :(
<Teddy> :(
<ninja_pony> Caramelldansen???
<Saturn> alexxm: our solar system would be ripped apart, for sure
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn heehe i when i look up into the sky theres only one star
<alexxm> right thanks Saturn
<Pale_Horse> Don't tell me the caramelldansen is only in my head! :O
<Saturn> the earth may well find itself flung into either of the galaxy's super massive black holes
<Phase4> Pale_Horse, its not
<Simon2> Caramelldansen!?
<alexxm> possibly Pale_Horse
<Twi_Fi> Phase4: yay
<Pale_Horse> Thank Luna.
<ninja_pony> Pale_Horse: ?? i have got no idea what going on lol Caramelldansen?? what is that
<alexxm> benny hill theme is best killing music
<Pale_Horse> Yay Yakity Sax!
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn mabey but theres a chance that the sun and the Earth will be out of range and avoid destruction
<Saturn> anyhoos, if you would like to observe this last-in-a-lifetime event: http://www.transitofvenus.org/june2012/eye-safety/281-six-ways-to-see-the-transit-of-venus
<CrazyCherry> .hk
<dishwasher_EXTREME> AHHH CrazyCherry you finally show up
<Starflash> mfw the observatory here has already ran out of eclipse protection
<CrazyCherry> dishwasher_EXTREME: I've been here all the time....
<Saturn> i've ordered a solar filter sepcifically for viewing this
<Saturn> i just hope it arrives today or tomorrow
<dishwasher_EXTREME> you werent here when im here/
<Saturn> solar filter for my telescope, i shoudl say
<Saturn> if my brother was here, i'd use his camera to take some pics for you all
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn when will it be your transit?
<alexxm> Saturn how long will the transit of venus last
<Pale_Horse> Transit rolls around = Overcast all day. :(
<dishwasher_EXTREME> whats a transit anyway
<alexxm> dishwasher_EXTREME eclipses with planets
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ohhhhh
<CrazyCherry> diashwasher_EXTREME: I have a personal life just FYI.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> of course
<Saturn> the transit is from 11:04pm Tuesday to 5:55am Wednesday, lasting 7 hours
<Pale_Horse> I'm pretty sure winter has been wrapped up already. :P
<Saturn> (both those times are UTC +1)
<dishwasher_EXTREME> can he see it in asia ?
<Saturn> so 10:04pm GMT, and 4:55am GMT
<alexxm> Pale_Horse not in australia
<Pale_Horse> You win THIS round, Logic... But there shall be another battle... :|
<Saturn> if you're lucky, you might be able to see it in asia
<dishwasher_EXTREME> where exactly Saturn
<alexxm> what Pale_Horse
<CrazyCherry> I'm cleaning my room, ping me if you have something to say.
<Saturn> dishwasher_EXTREME: well, you have the times and longitude for me, so you should be able to work it out :P
<Saturn> but seriously, google it and you should find some stuff about how/if you can view it
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn .....
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Saturn so where again?
<trollhunter> this song is gunna be stuck in my head
<Phase4> imho this map favors blue
<Phase4> this is a very long round
<Phase4> that will probably end now
<Saturn> sunrise here is 4:30am on Wednesday
<Saturn> so i only have a 25 minute window to view it
<Saturn> and only if the skies are clear
<Saturn> meh, according to BBC weather, it's going to be cloudy and rainy
<Saturn> so i guess i won't get a chance to see it myself :(

<Gunthler> Lil_B: Why is your Steam client in German if you don't speak it?
<Twi_Fi> Phase4 should get on webcam and do a tap dance for us.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ^^
<Phase4> trust me, you dont want to see me tap dance
