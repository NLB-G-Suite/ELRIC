<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 mindfuck
<Celes_Chere> Fou_Lou: Exactly: and that is all I will contribute to this. Mark Twain was awesome. Let's talk about that.
<Shamroc> INCOMING SCARY SHIT!
<JESmith71> Here it comes
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, never say never
<Obsidian> This part......
<JESmith71> THE scene
<Nyst> It was written by men far less knowledgable then us. Wether is does exist or not is moot: there is little chance the source was accurate.
<DocSane> Yes!
<Dken2021> oh this.... something I remember a long time ago
<Kandarihu> Oh yeah. We saw this before.
<Meanwhile> Sataaaan.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1bb_JRkAOk
<Fou_Lou> Celes_Chere: yeah. lets talk about things that exists. Twain was awesome. Even i just read 2 books.
<Dken2021> oh boy, it's santa!
<Vordox> DocSane: If we can't become angels... Why is all that about souls and heaven and hell part?
<Nyst> Satan is quite misunderstood
<Vordox> I love how Religion just keeps spinning until it's not even coherent anymore :P
<Kandarihu> Satan =/= Santa
<DocSane> Vordox: Getting to heaven isn't the same as being an angel.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No video links please~
<StormFox> evening all :) how is everypony :3
<owloysius> apple fritters, apple tarts
<Vordox> DocSane: "Where's my halo and harp"? :)
<Kandarihu> Humans don't become angels
<Celes_Chere> Kandarihu: and from this spills forth the secrets of the universe.
<Allegr0> purty good StormFox
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi StormFox
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Especially at this time, come one man!
<Agrold> hey everypon- oh my.. this video
<twilight_sprinkle> pineapples
<Fou_Lou> Vordox: dont forget if theyre out of explanations its an translation mistake
<JESmith71> Of course this was taken from Twain's story "The Mysterious Stranger"
<Vordox> I know Fou_Lou
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03on*
<P4ngya> claymation-ception?
<owloysius> make a huge chicken
<NullRadix> One of these days... I'm going to start taking pictures of my ice cream... so I can figure out if the other people in the house are really eating it or if I'm just paranoid...
<Ponies47> I'm gonna make a Nittany_Discord
<twilight_sprinkle> i would maek a poni
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 Nightmare Fuel
<owloysius> hahahahaha
<Nyst> Aw, lag again.
<owloysius> now we'll make them fight
<Kandarihu> It buffered for me for a second too
<Dawg_Major> KILL THEM WITH FIRE!!!
<owloysius> quick, kill the creators before they do anything alse to you.
<Chains> Oh my god
<Nyst> Weapons, protectice walls, rulers and laws right from the start.
<SparkleButt> Oh god, flashbacks
<Ponies47> This is Nightmare fuel O~O
<Dawg_Major> Oh god this scene.... ;~;
<owloysius> MOo
<twilight_sprinkle> frowny face
<StormFox> are we watching gumby with Gir voices?
*Ponies47 Hides under blanket
<Thrackerzod> WHAT THE FUCK AM I LOOKING AT
<SparkleButt> Seriously, who greenlighted this?
<Spectrum_Rush> and here we go
<StinkomanFan> FUCK YO SHIT
<Dawg_Major> ._.
<JESmith71> Smashy smashy
<Chains> I'm so scared D:
<Kandarihu> How the heck did this get made in the 1980s?
<SparkleButt> "Well, his name is Satan, that's strike one..."
<StinkomanFan> Chains, you ain't seen nothing yet
*Ponies47 Pokes head out from under blanket
<twilight_sprinkle> ebrbrbrb
<Dawg_Major> Lads...I give you the world we live in.......
<Celes_Chere> Kandarihu: many hours of intern work
<Chains> StinkomanFan: It's going to be a long night...
<Thrackerzod> Hi everyone...... um what am i looking at?
<Nyst> Humans have tons of potential, but very little actually realised.
<DocSane> God, can you imagine being a little kid in the theater watching this?
<Chains> Ohai Thrackerzod
<JESmith71> Maybe since it's an adapation of a Twain story? I dunno
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Thrackerzod
<StinkomanFan> DocSane, better than in the next theatre with Watership Down
<Fou_Lou> whos streaming by the way?
<Ponies47> Fou_Lou: Scoot-Scootaloo
<NullRadix> Hail, Thrackerzod!
<Fou_Lou> thanks Ponies47
<Chains> :o
<SparkleButt> D:
<Dken2021> hai Thrackerzod
<DocSane> StinkomanFan: Better those than the kid watching The Plague Dogs in the next theatre.
<twilight_sprinkle> a matrix
<SparkleButt> So this is why Mark Twain drank.
<Nyst> Satan was creepy but not actually evil. Or wrong.
<Vordox> Love the story, the telling, the animation, the quality.
<Kandarihu> Celes_Chere, that's not what I mean. How is it possible for something as grimdark as this to be made in the 1980s? This is obviously too scary for young children, and since it's automatically disqualified for viewing by 13+ because it's not live action.
<Chains> WHAT THE BUCK
<Fou_Lou> its better than the wired russian made cartoons that creep the fuck out of me
<twilight_sprinkle> heres indian JO!
<Thrackerzod> LSD the clamation
<Celes_Chere> Twain's a little cuckoo, but that is what made him awesome
<Spectrum_Rush> hahaha
<DocSane> Fou_Lou: Ever seen "Film! Film! Film!"?
<Fou_Lou> DocSane: nope
<Chains> Thrackerzod: Liberty Sanitation Depot? What does that have to do with anything?
<SparkleButt> It's simple. We kill the Twain.
<DocSane> Fou_Lou: That is a fantastic Russian cartoon
<twilight_sprinkle> DocSane: that sounds familiar
<StinkomanFan> DocSane or the poor bastards that snuck into the theater play Silence of the Lambs
<owloysius> clone her
<Celes_Chere> Kandarihu: Point taken. I point to Dark Crystal I guess.
<Nyst> Huh. I was right.
<DocSane> Aeronort
<Nyst> The little punk really is going to rob the man.
<Chains> Bye
<twilight_sprinkle> music night
<Spectrum_Rush> why is there always a n organ on ships?
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Chains
<Dken2021> seeya Chains
<Kandarihu> I'd think this is particularily darker than The Dark Crystal.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> See ya later Chains
<StinkomanFan> Aeronaut. Like the apprentice to Aerosmith
<SparkleButt> Seriously, what the hell.
<Meanwhile> Yeah, that 'aint creepy at all.
<Chains> I wasn't leaving, I was just turning on my AC...
<SparkleButt> I want to know what drugs this was made on so I can never take them.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: hell, this is darker than that batman movie
<StinkomanFan> Well, not looking at Twain the same way again
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile in the captains cabin
<Celes_Chere> Worst part folks: this is rated G
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, which one?
<P4ngya> why do captains play organs os much?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: last one
<[wub]ehren> kids too damn stoned to sleep
<Kandarihu> The Dark Knight Rises?
<Fou_Lou> Celes_Chere: what does G mean? Im not familiar with those ratings
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: havent seen the prev ones
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: si, that one
<SparkleButt> Five bucks say Twain straight up kills them.
<Spectrum_Rush> Celes_Chere: i consider that a good part more kids need to be scared shitless
<StinkomanFan> Fou_Lou, APPROVED FOR ALL AUDIENCES
<Celes_Chere> Fou_Lou: a six year old could buy a ticket and see it by themselves
<Nyst> I do hope they fail.
<Fou_Lou> Thanks Celes_Chere StinkomanFan
<Star_Shadow> the only rating i know is X
<Star_Shadow> jk
<twilight_sprinkle> its the flux capacitor
<owloysius> hahaha
<owloysius> it'll crash
<StinkomanFan> Oh gog
<SparkleButt> This can only end well.
<Kandarihu> I guess there's a law of animation that any being that is artificial is expendable, even if it is also sentient. The people that the devil created and then killed were artificial, and the censors could've been convinced that the speech about humans being worthless only refers to the clay people that were recently created.
<[wub]ehren> practicing your lines eh twain
<Celes_Chere> So where is King Arthur's court and that dastardly Connecticut Yankee?
<Nyst> Yeah but if you're religious and actually believe you were created from clay too, I bet it's even more scary.
<StinkomanFan> >Books
<StinkomanFan> >Real adventure
<SparkleButt> I'm pretty sure Brave Little Toaster was G and it had death.
<Chains> That's not hogtying...?
<StinkomanFan> I missed something didn't I?
<Nyst> Robbing and stealing count as adventure?
<StinkomanFan> Nyst Didn't you read Don Quixte?
<Kandarihu> Of course we don't believe we were created from clay.
<Chains> I'm missing ALOT of things here. I'm in full WTB mode.
<StormFox> writer's block XD
<StinkomanFan> THEY'LL HAVE TO GLUE YOU BACK TOGETHER
<StinkomanFan> IN HELL
<twilight_sprinkle> soo...thats a yes?
<Celes_Chere> StinkomanFan: but you can't gl-OH MY GAHHHH!
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, yup
<Kandarihu> And that's a good way to say yes.
<Ponies47> http://www.teamfortress.com/triad/ I don't them. I don't need them O_O
<Ponies47> *I don't need them
<Buytoast> you don't.

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello HellsFortune
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Ponies47
<HellsFortune> what am i watching ? o.o
*Ponies47 Hugs Nittany_Discord back
<Chains> Ohai HellsFortune
<Kandarihu> Okay. 3 headed aliens guarding a fluffy cloud heaven. Whatever.
<DocSane> I love this. This is one of the earliest science fiction stories ever.
<HellsFortune> so much bufferig
<HellsFortune> buffering
<DocSane> It's one of the first stories to talk about aliens in heaven.
<JESmith71> What was the name of this Twain story?
<owloysius> nope, no beer for you
<Ponies47> I'm liking the new items for TF2 but. MUST...NOT...BUY...ITEMS! Trying...to...save...money for a new computer O_O
<owloysius> hahaha
<twilight_sprinkle> aw man, but i wanted a halo
<DocSane> Heaven sounds awesome!
<Vordox> PARTY!
<JESmith71> Alien Rave Heaven
<Meanwhile> Alien rave.
<Chains> Ponies47: o_o Should I be glad I don't play it?
<DocSane> Dat Heinlein reference
<owloysius> i don't grok it.
<RobertRevenge> What the hell am I watching?
<Ponies47> Chains: It's fun :3
<twilight_sprinkle> i would hate it there
<Celes_Chere> For each man: Their own Heaven, or Hell...
<Kandarihu> Heaven is a wonderful place, but this depiction of Heaven is just plain silly.
<twilight_sprinkle> RobertRevenge: mark twain special
<DocSane> RobertRevenge: Alien heaven, man! It's awesome!
<Fou_Lou> Ponies47: same with me any buying TF2 stuff. Need to get my girlfriend to get a hand of the new minigun
<Nyst> Those kids and their hippy hoppy music confound it!
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: wait for it
<Kandarihu> No human portrayal of Heaven can ever do the real thing justice.
<Cypresswolf> I wouldnt go in either
<owloysius> hahahaha
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Yep.
<DocSane> 24 hr pizza and beer.
<twilight_sprinkle> sign here, sign here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like Celes_Chere said, I think Heaven and Hell are what each person makes it out to be.
<owloysius> boring
<Meanwhile> Shhh
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: definitely
<Chains> .............
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile, in Hell...
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: Oi.
<XAX> At home for lunch. Gonna take a copy of 50 Shades of Grey that's on the dining room table for some reason back after lunch and get it out at reading.
<Chains> Egypt
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile, It's gonna happen and you know it
*owloysius facepalms.
<Chains> Sphancks.
<Kandarihu> Did I just hear one of Applejack's catchphrases?
<XAX> fur the lulz
<Nyst> Traditional Hells does sound kinda fun besides the whole burning thing. But hey, you get used to anything.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mark Twain and his solid beard.
<DocSane> The actual story is much better. He gets into human heaven, gets bored in about an hour, and learns that the halo and hymm book and stuff is just given to newbs to work out their expaectations.
<Ponies47> Fou_Lou: I see. I need to buy somthing from the store to make more space in my backpack but I really don't wanna spend my money on ANYTHING else until I get a new computer :<
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: Eh, yeah true.
<Spectrum_Rush> XAX: goodluck with that fanfic
<NullRadix> Nittany_Discord: and so the Thief was sent to a hell filled with treasures beyond imagining... where there was nothing left to steal
<Nyst> Limbo also sounds like an interesting place.
<Reikim> Evening
<JESmith71> Yeah that heaven story was taken from Twain's final work
<Reikim> Well this looks interesting! What is it?
<XAX> Spectrum_Rush: lol

<StinkomanFan> Ponies47, can't they just add 'em to the random drop?

*owloysius noms on Nittany_Discord
<Reikim> Yeah
<[wub]ehren> damn
<otakon> my tablet can stream this without issue
<Reikim> One of the QA testers decided to be an asshole and leak it
<owloysius> tastes like chicken.
<cachi01> chicken like tastes
*XAX respects Nittany_Discords personal space
<otakon> HOW COME MY USED TABLET HAS A BETTER WIFI CARD THEN MY USB ADAPTER?
<Reikim> Now Mane6 is locking down everything. No more QA testers, no more updates, no nothing until further notice.

<StinkomanFan> STOP BEING A PUSS HUCK
<Celes_Chere> Adventure!
<cachi01> otakon: idk science?
<[wub]ehren> the most i would do would be let a friend play it with me round my house
<otakon> and then he became star stuff
<StinkomanFan> So... Tom's Two-face?
<Reikim> otakon: Crappy adapter?
<[wub]ehren> if i was a tester
<[wub]ehren> that sucks
<otakon> Reikim: must be
<cachi01> MARK TWAIN IS TWO FACE HELP US BATMAN
<otakon> that's it ordering another
<StinkomanFan> OK WHAT THE FUCK
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or, it's going through it's orbit.

<Chains> It's over?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> G'night everypony.

<Celes_Chere> AND THEN THEY BANGED
<cachi01> night ZappyTheUnicorn
<[wub]ehren> project will take longer now too
<[wub]ehren> because of thatr
<Kandarihu> Well, that was cool.
<Dken2021> oh well, looks like people get to practice early
<Cypresswolf> that was interesting
<otakon> Chains: good luck
<Reikim> And it came juse before a major update too
<cachi01> clay/10
<StinkomanFan> Not as terrifying as I thought it would be
<[wub]ehren> i downloaded melty blood and shit to practice

<kidzrul434> what did i miss?
<Kandarihu> Fluffycloud Heaven /10
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And the FREAKING PUZZLES
<Dken2021> eh doubt that, all they're doing is closing testing
<StormFox> all we need now is the california raisins XD
<Chains> WTB/10
<cachi01> OPUUUUUUUUZZLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Reikim> I'm lousy with fighting games that aren't Super Smash Bros, so I was just going to wait for the game itself.
<[wub]ehren> exactly
<[wub]ehren> means less testers
<Reikim> No
<kidzrul434> what was that video i miss?
<Reikim> Means no testers
<Reikim> period
<JESmith71> Now a repeat of this
*Celes_Chere slow claps
<Cypresswolf> I may not be around tomorrow night - heading down to Galveston to see my cousin's concert - has a gig at a hotel on the water tomorrow night
<Reikim> They're terminated the testing program with extreme prejudice.
<JESmith71> Again for good measure
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So you don't forget..
<Dken2021> sorry, I meant closed development
<[wub]ehren> people making it still count as testers to me
<kidzrul434> hey bronies I have a problem
<Chains> Anypony up for some Froot Loops?
<Reikim> Okay then
<cachi01> kidzrul434: wut happened?
<Reikim> Anyway
<Reikim> Ffffff
<cachi01> Chains: yummy
<kidzrul434> there is a gang of bronies at my camp but they won't let me hang with them
<Chains> Okay, kidz...
<Chains> Go up to them, and say "BUCK YOU"
<flutter_spin> Apples!
<Chains> And then wait a few days
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Say Rarity is worst pony, then they'll at least pay attention to you
<cachi01> kidzrul434: go and hang with other people
<Reikim> Melty Blood, you say? I might try it.
<Kandarihu> This kind of reminds me of Terranigma.
<Reikim> Although I hate practicing against CPUs...they're no fun.
<Cypresswolf> no no, thats not the right advice, kidzrul434 try finding some common ground, talk to them a bit, see where it takes you
<FlyingShoppingCart> Uh guys, what's this?
<Reikim> Scoot-Scootaloo: Who will?
*Celes_Chere is experiencing a deficiency in Yankees from Connecticut and pre-medieval Europe
<StormFox> why do they sound like gir?
<kirzstryfe> ty Reikim :)
<StinkomanFan> FlyingShoppingCart, the Mysterious Stranger by MArk Twain
<Reikim> Hallo again kirz
<cachi01> the strange stranger would be a better title.....
<cachi01> its more fun lol
<kirzstryfe> really hope the Mane6 guys had the testers sign some kind of legal doc though, would provide a bit more entertainment
<cachi01> imo
<Reikim> They had them sign something
<Reikim> And "NDA Agreement" I think they said
<kirzstryfe> lol, then the leak is screwed
<kirzstryfe> they'll have him by the balls on this one
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Dis sum deep shizzle~
<Reikim> The link was taken down in seconds of it being posted, but people still have it.
<RaveBrony> Hey everypony im ba, OH HELL not this!! O_O
<Nyst> I switched to Firefox to see if it was my browser, but it's the same.
<Chains> Aw man, I forgot to do alot of stuff today...
<Reikim> I doubt they'll go after the tester though. It doesn't seem like something they would do.
<cachi01> hi RaveBrony lol
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03AAND then I do a moodswitch
<Dken2021> and there we go
<Reikim> Thanks dari for telling us all about what we were already talking about.
<cachi01> OH HEY THERE IS THE LEAK
<Spectrum_Rush> I can do no wrong because i don't know what it is... how profound
<RaveBrony> Hey cachi01 :P
<RaveBrony> o.o
<flutter_spin> WOHO
<kirzstryfe> he's not actually there, it's all the bot watching the rss feed
<Chains> OHAI
<Chains> Good
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: plug it up with some towels!
<Obsidian> dat moodwhiplash
<JESmith71> And suddenly Smile Smile Smile
<Reikim> I know, I'm just being witty. Or trying anyway, I need the practice.
*Celes_Chere Can't. Stop. SMILING! :D
<Kandarihu> We really need this.
<Dken2021> well, no matter, they're still developing, and the final build will be precise and balanced than the beta
<flutter_spin> wut? :P
<Nyst> Man I knew it from the second I heard the game was leaked.
<Chains> Dinky!
<Reikim> I hope so. But now I'll have nothing to tide me over until the release...I really hope they can make a Christmas release.
<Shooeie> The skyrim version was better.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Mario> leak?
<twilight_sprinkle> i just cant get it out of my head
<NullRadix> My condolences to the FiM team...
<Mario> someone call for a plumber?
<Chains> OH NO BUFFER
<Nyst> Yeah the FiM game got leaked.
<Chains> DONT DO THAT NOW D:
<Chains> I need this after that movie
<cachi01> I NEED THE LINK TO THE FIM GAME
<flutter_spin> "no major content-related updates to the website will be forthcoming until further notice" that's rough
<cachi01> NOW
<twilight_sprinkle> so much for brony trust, people are still people. cant trust em
<Dken2021> hey Mario , wanna go bowling?
<Nyst> Honestly, I'm surprised people would do this? You KNOW how this hurts developers.
<Reikim> I am so piiiisssssed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> too lazy to look for the leak, too lazy too play fighting games right now, sucks for the one who leaked the stuff if he signed a NDA i know cause i been in some microsoft betas :p
<Nyst> cachi01: no you don't. You're not that kind of person, are you?
<Mario> screw you Dken2021
<Reikim> cachi01: Shame. SHAME ON YOU.
<Kandarihu> The game might be lower quality, now that the QA team's been axed.
*Garretbrony smiles :D
<Kandarihu> I keep hearing that as Friendly Snoppy Friends of Mine.
<kirzstryfe> I do hope they go after the leak though, if only to teach the person that actions have consequences
<flutter_spin> wait a second. Wasn't Half Life leaked big too?
<Nyst> Why even play it? It's unfinished, buggy and broken, as a game that's in the middle of development is!
<Reikim> All testing terminated, BSUs terminated, content-related updates terminated...I don't even have a swear word potent enough for my anger.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Oki, I am done for the night!
<cachi01> Reikim: I LOVE PLAYING BETAS AND LEAKS
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03See y'all tomorrow!
*Reikim smacks cachi01
<Chains> This is why I want to live in Ponyville. The entire town breaks into song almost ever day.
<Shooeie> Cya scoot
<Buytoast> i see that maryln manson guy
<Garretbrony> Kandarihu how did you I was looking through your trash
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Scoot-Scootaloo
<cachi01> Reikim: it makes me feel important in the gaming community :3 xd
<Buytoast> click that video
<Nyst> cachi01: what about when it negatively affects the people making it?
<Buytoast> they shoulda been more careful
<otakon> thanks Scoot-Scootaloo
<Cypresswolf> are ya'll playing Simon's cat? Love those animations
<Buytoast> why in the hell would you trust others?
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, thanks for streaming.
<Spectrum_Rush> cachi01: but don't you see there will be no beta of it for you to play now
<Reikim> I don't think they will, but it's unlikely we'll hear anything about it either way.
<twilight_sprinkle> on one hand its already leaked, so it wont change anything if you play. on the other hand if the devs dont want it, doesnt feel right to disobey them since its a free game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they should but probably is just going to end in an agrement from both parts and no court involved
<Shooeie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp32TigGfZk
<Reikim> What could they hope to get out of him, anyway? They're people with lives; they don't have the time to go through with that.
<Nyst> It'll delay the final game. It'll cost it in quality. It'll even lose a little of the love put into it.
<cachi01> DAMMIT
<Soul> what?
<Cypresswolf> :) night 3 of creepy pasta before bed for me
<Chains> Stream over? Post vids!
<Soul> what game?
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: sounds fun :D
<CrazyHippie1234> www.NOTyoutube.com/blahblanponyvids
<Chains> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR-x2Go4r0Q
<twilight_sprinkle> whats a QA anyway? are they fan testers?
<Reikim> Taking money from him would be against the project's philosophy of freeness.
<Nyst> They had an NDA. And they trusted people because this is the bronies here. That makes it doubly sad.
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw7BGbsf9_o Two Bits: Party of One .. funniest thing ever
<NullRadix> QA = quality assurance
<Nyst> Quality Assurance.
<NullRadix> essentially testers
<Kandarihu> For the game to be delayed even further is a major dissapointment. It's taken an unbearable amount of time for it to come out.
<Nyst> People who play the bugged, broken version so that things can be fixed.
<Soul> what game?
<Cypresswolf> twilight_sprinkle: I haven't found much that actually scares me, know any good creepy pasta stories?
<Kandarihu> Soul, Fighting is Magic
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Quality Assurance
<Garretbrony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z13d3UgQ1U4&feature=channel&list=UL
<Soul> someone leaked it? :[
<kirzstryfe> so was leaking the project, but whatever they do, if he signed an NDA he's on the wrong end of it
<Reikim> Soul: I am so mad about it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nyst: if theyre just testers, cant they find more?
<Nyst> I just feel sad about it. Those poor guys.
<Reikim> True enough. But again, we probably won't hear anything about it, unless the leaker decides to write an open letter or something.
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: fraid not, not intoo that stuff :P
<Nyst> twilight_sprinke: not if those people will just keep breaking their NDA's and posting it all over the net.
<Nyst> They just had their trust broken.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Testing program's been axed for good.
<kirzstryfe> the issue the Mane6 would have now is being able to trust anyone outside of the team to test for them, since the trust was already broken
<Garretbrony> Nyst Reikim this is perfect for Pinkie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmyurvC5Au4&feature=BFa&list=ULQ9EIR8QlarA
<twilight_sprinkle> Nyst: well, on the bright side, its no physical loss like programmers
<Nyst> It's as much an emotional blow as it is a practical one.
<Soul> why would someone leak it? people can't be patient anymore can they -_-
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: they just need to ask some friends to test out
<cachi01> guys..... I NEED A LINK FOR THE LEAK :[
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: google?
<Reikim> kirzstryfe: They've decided to ax all testing for good, so there's the answer :9
<Reikim> :(
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: google aint helping very much :(
<Buytoast> try /mlp/
<Buytoast> maybe a ponyfag there will have it
<cachi01> eww 4chan
<Nyst> I'm sorry cachi01, but you won't find it here.
<kirzstryfe> but in more fun news, the target near me got in the new mlp toys :)
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: doesnt make a big difference. id like to know how much of the actual QA was friends of them
<Reikim> cachi01: NOBODY IS GIVING IT TO YOU
<Reikim> Yus
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: heh.
<cachi01> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUFSGUOSJKDCHIPSDVIDVSIPVSISDV
<Reikim> Which ones?
<Garretbrony> I am going to Sturgis for the Boston Concert anypony else going?
<cachi01> Buytoast: i wont get into 4chan its scary O_o
<Buytoast> wow3
<kirzstryfe> the minifig sets, and most of the wedding ones
<Buytoast> i bet you find tunder your bed ascasry rtoo
<Reikim> Very nice.
<Soul> -3-
<kirzstryfe> I got the Cloudsdale set and the shiny set of 7
<Reikim> I've never had the balls to go into a store and buy ponies >.>
<Celes_Chere> I'm not even going to look, it would be no different than if there were no leak so what's the point in seeking something I shouldn't have?
<Buytoast> these damn rubber gloves are a bitch to type with
<Reikim> cachi01: I think I speak for everyone when I say we are DISAPPOINTED.
<kirzstryfe> I need to find somewhere that has the new wave of blindbags though >.<
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: can they sue for breaking an NDA agreement?
<Garretbrony> cachi01 wasn't the brony fandom Forged in the Flames of 4chan?
<cachi01> Reikim: ITS JUST LOOKS SO EEEEEEEPIC
<Soul> i just came back from their website
<cachi01> Garretbrony: yeah but still i wont enter 4chan....
<Celes_Chere> Garretbrony: It was the banning of ponies that really forged it, so sort of.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: They can, if it was written out all properly legal (which it probably was, these guys are smart).
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i hoghly doubt that. Since no monetary damage is done. If it where a real project with money in it they probably could
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: they should, to make a point
<Garretbrony> cachi01 neither will I . Stick to PoniChan
<Reikim> Soul: No testing. No updates. No BSUs. I am so mad.
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: hmm, thats too bad
*Bronysith noms on Reikim s love of gurren lagann
<Soul> who first leaked it?! :[
<Reikim> I cannot be nommed right now because I am burning. With. Rage.
<Reikim> Soul: A QA tester, no name yet.
*Bronysith noms on Reikim s rage
<Garretbrony> SPOILERS it was his sled
<Celes_Chere> Soul: an undisclosed party
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: but im not sure in that. And it probably depends on their country too. but they have to find the one who leaked it first
<Nyst> Imagine if the team'd fall apart over this. No FiM gets made, and this is all there'd ever be?
<Garretbrony> Nyst MOTHER OF CELESTIA
<Reikim> Nyst: They're stronger than that. But we'll all have to wait longer for it.
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yeah thats right, i forgot they might not even know who did it
<Soul> because some idiot leaked it, we have to wait longer
<Kandarihu> They'd only fall apart over this if one of the core members of the team leaks a build.
<Nyst> Yeah I know they're stronger. But this is the kind of risk that's been taken here.
<Chains> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-p0CIz9R04&feature=related
<Reikim> The worst part is that I can't even see WHY a tester would leak the build.
<Nyst> Internet fame.
<Reikim> Seriously. What profit do you gain? You just hurt everyone.
<Soul> a troll?
<Reikim> And then if you do get famous it'll be the wrong kind; you'll get hatemail and death threats, etc.
<Buytoast> a ponyfag coulda paid him
<Soul> trolls dont care what type of fame
<Buytoast> most of em have no shame
<flutter_spin> wow. The /mlp/ where FiM mediafire link is just... going nuts
<flutter_spin> I don't think you can quash that
<Reikim> It's the kind of headdesk-worthy stupidity that makes me fear for the sake of the human race.
<Buytoast> oh man
<Buytoast> i gotta get i on this
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Reikim> No
<Reikim> nonono
<Buytoast> if only i werent banned from 4chan
<Reikim> Please don't go get it
<twilight_sprinkle> i need to check /mlp/ as well, must be fun
<Buytoast> i'm not getting the gasme
<Buytoast> a waste of space to me
<twilight_sprinkle> i probably wont get the game either, i dont play many games anyway
<Buytoast> but all the butthurt
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Soul> im not
<Obsidian> Well I gotta shut down. Night everypony!
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Obsidian
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I like the game. I'll play the game. I just probably won't go out of my way playing it more than a week.
<Reikim> Eh, /mlp/ is just being assholes as usual.
<flutter_spin> So it really doesn't matter to me when I play it
<Lunar_Brony> good evening everypony

<NullRadix> otakon: a leak is out
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> new season starts on december 12 :p
<Lunar_Brony> I almost thought it was Maid Hour
<NullRadix> otakon: letter from the devs linked on EQD
<flutter_spin> harhar Nit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^ jk i don't even know
<Reikim> ...So long
<Reikim> I go out of my way to avoid spoilers for that too
<flutter_spin> its otakon. In fact, a commenter in the EQD has posted the main page in /mlp/ dl

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like my pun title?
<DocSane> And I'm back. What's on?
<Reikim> otakon: NO IT'S NOT IT'S LEAKED AND IF YOU DOWNLOAD IT I WILL SHIP YOU WITH THE ENTIRE CHAT
<Celes_Chere> In other news: Sweetie Belle's squeaks are still adorable.
<cachi01> i checked the /mlp/ and well its not that ba
<flutter_spin> so technically, it isn't out.
<cachi01> d
<Soul> lol
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> Man, I think I need some help getting started with this Newbie Artist Training Grounds thing.
<otakon> Reikim: please don't
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i heard there is going to be hay
<Spectrum_Rush> you silly Nittany_Discord XD
*Reikim whistles and plugs his ears
<cachi01> 2 minutes remaining......
<Soul> its not even the full thing, why bother?
<cachi01> OMGMOMGOMGOMGOMGOGMMGOOGMMOGMGO
<NullRadix> Kandarihu|H8s2Clean: gimme a sec I'll link you some help
<DocSane> Celes_Chere: Sweetie Belle is the best CMC.
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> I have a Bamboo Tablet and Gimp. Those are my tools of choice.
<Reikim> otakon: Don't download the build then.
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> NullRadix, thanks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Forgot about Maid Hour. Fucking panic attacks.
<Celes_Chere> DocSane: /)
<Reikim> cachi01: Don't. Please don't. Please please don't.
<Garretbrony> whois streaming
<DocSane> Celes_Chere: Of course, that's like saying gold is the best precious metal Silver and platinum are great, too.
<Lunar_Brony> ATM, nopony
<Garretbrony> darn
<flutter_spin> To a certain extent, I could care less if other people play it. Rubbing in the fact that it was leaked and "trolling" about it --- that's harsh
<Celes_Chere> DocSane: This is true.
<NullRadix> Kandarihu|H8s2Clean: http://mlp-atg-alumni.deviantart.com/gallery/31073417
<DocSane> I remember when people hated the CMC. Because, you know, how dare this children's cartoon have children in it.
*Reikim is still simmering
<cachi01> DocSane: xd
<cachi01> OMG IT FINISHED
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, thanks
<Reikim> cachi01: ...You. Bastard.
<DocSane> Is anything streaming, because I see nothing on my end.
<Buytoast> This is glorious.
<flutter_spin> I'm not good with kids. Therefore I would prefer an episode without the CMC. Yet, they are cute and admireable
<cachi01> Reikim: IF THERE WAS A LEAK OF HALF LIFE 3 WOULD YOU DOWNLOAD I?
<Buytoast> This whole leaked deal has made my night.
<Celes_Chere> DocSane: negative on the streaming
<Reikim> cachi01: No actually, I wouldn't. Sorry, nope.
<DocSane> flutter_spin: I'm actually very good with kids.
<cachi01> Reikim: oh umm well uhmm uhmmm ABANDON THREAD
<Fou_Lou> lol
<Soul> cachi01:it's not worth it, its not even the full thing
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I just hate seeing the CMC embarrase themselves or run into danger
<DocSane> flutter_spin: Sadly, I have none of my own.
<Spectrum_Rush> cachi01: received -50 respect
<Spectrum_Rush> :P
<Reikim> flutter_spin: So you hate children? Because...that's what children do, I know from much experience.
<cachi01> Spectrum_Rush: how many respect do i have left?
<Reikim> cachi01: You're now at negative three.
<DocSane> flutter_spin: Most of the show is about dealing with embarrassment and failure.
<flutter_spin> I don't hate children. I hate getting in trouble when I do something with kids that the parents chew me out for
<cachi01> dammit
<Spectrum_Rush> who would to answer that
<Soul> cachi01 0 from my end :P
<cachi01> here have some muffins Reikim
<Reikim> cachi01: ...Fine, you're at zero now.
<DocSane> flutter_spin: Are you an adult or still a kid yourself?
*Bronysith salivates on Reikim
<cachi01> Reikim: yay
*Reikim tosses Bronysith a muffin
*Bronysith salivates on Reikim
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: yo dawg, i herd you like creepypasta
<Celes_Chere> To have a CMC success episode would likely result in their gaining cutie marks.
<ShadowQuill> I just realized: The unicorn Cake baby could levitate herself, so being a unicorn still gives you flight!
<flutter_spin> a kid is free to act like an idiot. An adult doing the same thing --- well, you can't
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d85WJUVBT1I&feature=related
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: Oh my... GOD!!!
<Celes_Chere> So...a dream episode maybe? That could work...
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: bwahahahahaha
<DocSane> flutter_spin: The kid can be forgiven for being foolish. An adult is supposed to know better and set a good example.
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ Wonderful, twilight_sprinkle - Faved
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: :)
<lowfn> Hello everypony
<Buytoast> Oh man
<ShadowQuill> Why is the stream farting on my best enemy and my worst friend?!
<Buytoast> i wonder how much in tatters ponychan is
*Ponies47 Hides from lowfn
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: shes stitching twilights fleeeesh~
<Cypresswolf> O_o oh my...Opal?!?
<Garretbrony> god
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: Art of Distress
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: yup:P
<lowfn> Wheres Ponies47?
<ShadowQuill> WHO IS BEST PONY
<flutter_spin> It's a complex issue. Definitely not because I hate kids. I just don't like responsibility of something going wrong.
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: PINKIE PIE
<Garretbrony> who wants PIZZAROLLS?
<Reikim> Buytoast: I predict a rift between those that download and those that don't.
<Soul> PINKIE. PIE.
<cachi01> Garretbrony: PINKIE PE
<ShadowQuill> WHY ARE WE YELLING?!
<cachi01> PINKIE PE!
<flutter_spin> I constantly get "You made my kid do this! Shame on you!"
<cachi01> PIE*
<flutter_spin> I hate that.
*Ponies47 Pokes his head out
<Ponies47> Ohai lowfn :P
<lowfn> There you are
<ShadowQuill> I THOUGHT FOR SOME REASON THAT MAYBE EVERYPONY IS BEST PONIES. THAT IS NOT EVEN CORRECT GRAMMAR
<Chains> What I miss?
<ShadowQuill> I AM HAVING TROUBLE HEARING YOU GUYS. SPEAK UP!
*Soul gave cachi01 3 points of respect back
<Ponies47> Hey is there a stream? I got nothing?
<Chains> Neither do I
*lowfn tosses Ponies47 a muffin and then dusts his toes
<cachi01> Soul: :)
<flutter_spin> Which is why I'm conflicted with the CMC. I love thee, but I'd prefer episodes with the mane 6
*Ponies47 Noms on lowfn muffin and has his toes dusted
<Buytoast> This is delicious
*ShadowQuill eats Soul's 3 points of respect he gave cachi01
<Buytoast> it's like a buffet tonight
<Ponies47> IS THERE A STREAM!?!
<Chains> About that FiMFiction?
<Buytoast> and i'm lovin it
<Soul> lol
<cachi01> u cant eat my respect ShadowQuill!
<Engineer> Ponies47: Nope.
*ShadowQuill farts on the floor while waiting
<Cypresswolf> twilight_sprinkle: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9JthOJrDpI&feature=related :3
<Ponies47> Engineer: Thanks
<Xaiden|okari> Chains: What FiM fiction
<Soul> though i am a girl :P
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: BUT IT IS SO DELICIOUS
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: you mustve been hungry
<flutter_spin> Yes. FimFiction: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid Read my story :P
<Reikim> Buytoast: ponychan is being...surprisingly cool about the release.
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: yep, saw that one :P
<Buytoast> oh i'm always hungry
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: OK FINE
<Buytoast> the mods are probably deleting all the threads
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: i thought you were banned from 4chan?
<Buytoast> i was
<Buytoast> i can still read it
<Buytoast> i can't post
*Soul gives cachi01 3 more points
<Shooeie> Any one here speak french?
<Cypresswolf> twilight_sprinkle: Why is it Pinkie Pie's voice sound so much creepier in G major
<Thrackerzod> hello everone
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: When Fluttershy said COME OUT I pooped on your floor.
<Ponies47> POOTIS
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: And then I emptied your fridge.
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: MY floor??:[
<DocSane> Shooeie: Barely.
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: maybe cause its high-pitched?
*Soul heads to the bomb shelter
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: Yes, yours. UMAD?
<Reikim> Buytoast: I'm surprised. Ponychan is being very calm about this leak. On /mlp/ it's all swearing and arguing and calling Mane6 a bunch of autistic aspergers...but on Ponychan they ask nicely, reply politely, and walk away..
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: I AM NOT DONE *poops on your bed*
<Buytoast> because ponychan mods delete anything they don't like
<Buytoast> and apparently they don't like opinions
<flutter_spin> Someone leak Equestria Online or something
<twilight_sprinkle> pfffhahaha i see /b/ is as glorious as ever
*lowfn dusts ShadowQuill's poop
<flutter_spin> now THAT would be interesting
<Soul> no
<Reikim> Or maybe they're just, yknow, less vitriolic than 4chan.
<Marx> So, did I miss the Star Wars Ep III Rifftrax?
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: GODDAMNIT GET OUT OF MY HOUSE
<Soul> leaks are stupid
<flutter_spin> yep Marx
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: NO. *poops on your duster*
<Marx> ...When was it shown?
<GabeMoist> Hai gais :3
<DocSane> I want a finished version of the game, not some buggy alpha or beta.
<Soul> all they do is cause flamewars and delay the game
<Celes_Chere> ^
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: NO! *poops on the welcome mat*
<flutter_spin> I don't mind playing a beta, buggy intro, sample, taste of something
*lowfn pulls out a spare duster and dusts his poopy duster
*twilight_sprinkle kicks ShadowQuill out of his house
<flutter_spin> It at least lets me know what to expect
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: *poops on you*
<Marx> flutter_spin, When was it shown?
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Equestria Online is ded
<GabeMoist> . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: FFFFUUUUUUUUU
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Like, permanently.
<flutter_spin> didn't they reform Reikim ?
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: *poops on those letters*
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Not according to the official site.
*lowfn dusts twilight_sprinkle 's toes and the poop on twilight_sprinkle 's head

<Chains> All teh reacts
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Apparently they HAD a demo, though.

<twilight_sprinkle> madness, madness upon madness!!!
*twilight_sprinkle burns ShadowQuill with a flamethrower
*lowfn dusts all the poop

<Reikim> Tanks daribot
*ShadowQuill poops on twilight_sprinkle's hands
<Soul> because i want to play a buggy beta instead of a full released game
<cachi01> well.... i suck at FIM
<cachi01> xd
<cachi01> i cant hit the goddamn bot
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: youre already dead >:I
<cachi01> AND IT DOESNT EVEN MOVE
<flutter_spin> Great. Now I have to relook up the old site data. Hangon...
<Soul> that DOESNT make me feel guilty everytime i would play it :(
<cachi01> ii need someone to play with me
*lowfn dusts twilight_sprinkle 's poopy hands

*Chains looks around and points at himself
<twilight_sprinkle> lowfn: thanks man!
<flutter_spin> that's it, Reikim. I knew the old team moved onto something else. I forgot the new title
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: *poops on all your dusters*
*twilight_sprinkle catches ShadowQuill and throws him into a pit of lava
*lowfn takes out duster hidden below twilight_sprinkle 's house and dusts his dusters
*ShadowQuill poops and the lava comes at twilight_sprinkle
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm finally done with Batman arkham City
<lowfn> Dont ask why I have a duster under your home
<CrimsonPhoenix> except for the campaigns
<Barbetos|Quakecon> And I am back
*Soul gets out the poopcleaner 5000
*ShadowQuill dusts lowfn's dusters with poop
*twilight_sprinkle dodges ShadowQuill poop and watches him die
<Barbetos|Quakecon> There is STILL a line to get into this plac
<Barbetos|Quakecon> Its insane
<Lunar_Brony> what the . . . it's not Maid Hour yet
<Lunar_Brony> is it?
*ShadowQuill doesn't die, as twilight_sprinkle hoped

<twilight_sprinkle> Soul: we must destroy this menace! D:
<Reikim> ...I missed the chance to join Legends of Equestria's writing staff. Because I only found out about it until now, and it was only open for a week.
*ShadowQuill cheers up twilight_sprinkle by giving him poop ice cream
*twilight_sprinkle stabs ShadowQuill
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If my panic attacks stop, maybe I'll stream some games.
*lowfn takes out his undirtyble super-duster 9001 and dusts the water the poop and then takes a cork and plugs it into ShadowQuill 's anus
*Soul uses her pyro flamethrower
*kirz|art noms on Nittany_Discord

<flutter_spin> Oh and Target had the family sets. I got all 3 sets. I love thee.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My situation is complicated and I'm not getting real help from family for it. Really, family is part of the problem. I keep fearing that I'm going to get pushed by my mom and her friend because I'm not looking for work, but I'm not well enough to work.
<ShadowQuill> Soul: *poops on your letter*
<Ponies47> Never mind -_-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really hate living at home.
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: Because I am like that
*Soul cleans it and sends it away
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: i kno dat feel so well man...
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: well all you can do is try
<flutter_spin> Heh me too Nit. My mom is hysterical. I find her more comical here lately than usual.
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: You had to move back home? :( (just returned to the chat)
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: how are you not well enough?
<ShadowQuill> Soul: *Princess Celestia thinks you are trying to troll her, and challenges you to a duel*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes. A month ago.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: It's complicated.
<RaveBrony> :(
*lowfn calls The Doctor and puts ShadowQuill inside the TARDIS and then the TARDIS goes to 9001 B.C. and The Doctor kicks ShadowQuill into that time period then leaves
<Lunar_Brony> I'm 15. I would like to move out if I could
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: okay
<flutter_spin> She suddenly wants to buy roach poison because she thinks I brought some home in the boxes from work because I didn't freeze them for 24 hours beforehand
<Buytoast> what happened to who now?
<Soul> *refuses the duel*
<RaveBrony> My family is now pushing for me to get a job...but they want me to help pay off Their bills :\
<Chains> Nittany_Discord: Come here :3
<RaveBrony> When i start working my paychecks will already be spent
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have no money.
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: LIAR! Doctor is my friend! We go to when you were unpooped on and we both poop you to death, making your existence cease.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm trapped in hell basically.
<RaveBrony> :'(
<RaveBrony> That sucks...
<kirz|art> lol, on the little cardboard insert for the Cloudsdale minifig set, there's a stylized picture of Scootaloo flying
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With little help.
<Lunar_Brony> ouch
<Chains> Oh. Nevermind, then.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01From family.
<lowfn> ShadowQuill: Doctor doesnt do that.
*Chains leaves
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: OR DOES HE?!
<lowfn> ShadowQuill: No... he doesnt :D
<flutter_spin> I never chewed out people for not having a job, but now I fully understand the difficulty of getting a job. I usually praise people for just bearing with it unemployed
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.mane6.com/2012/08/open-letter.html
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow
<CrimsonPhoenix> just wow
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: well the way i see it, is that youre honestly trying. if your family doesnt understand, thats their problem. just keep trying, and heal up, and just ignore them. thats what i do :P
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: What makes you think he would not change his mind?
<Reikim> wat
<lowfn> ShadowQuill: Because has not an idiot
<Reikim> Bit of a dichotomy between show staff and toy staff, methinks.
<lowfn> hes*
<kirz|art> one sec, I'll get a shot of it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I am trying.
<flutter_spin> But my mom is giving a little bit of heat for me not paying her. The thing is: Everytime I pay her, she goes on vacation.
<kirz|art> more of fandom vs toy staff
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: Well... *teleports away from you and steals some of your valuable items*
<lowfn> Nittany_Discord you could live with me for free
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love my mom and grandmother.
<JESmith71> So I take it Shizuka isn't running the Ep III Rifftrax after all?

*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin at lowfn
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just hate feeling like a teenager with no freedom, independence, or control over my life.

<Soul> :3
<Dken2021> Nittany_Discord somehow pull in thousands of subscribers, become a partner, and make money from the ads, though that may take time
<Buytoast> the prince one flutter_spin?
*Soul slaps ShadowQuill back. "get back in the jar!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> can someone tell me what's wrong with this? http://ponyconfessions.tumblr.com/post/28598474207
<flutter_spin> All three kind of revolve around my OC: Moonlight Sonata. Farewell Scroll is an off story oneshot.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dken2021: Doing what?
<superretroworld> Ponies47: i have to admit i love that one song from snugglen bunny 'you are my sweet love'
<Allegr0> is the stream off or is my internet still derping like crazy?
<flutter_spin> Drocsid is first, Moon Time is second, I'm working on the third one.
<Buytoast> hmm
*ShadowQuill yells "NO!" and gets out of the jar, scampering back into oblivion
<Buytoast> i'll just read the short one
<lowfn> Nittany_Discord: Idk make an original flash animation series?
<Reikim> I wish I could get ponies
<flutter_spin> Sumica is my favorite mod so I stuck him throughout
<Reikim> I am simply not man enough
<Dken2021> Nittany_Discord whatever's under the guidelines of youtube's policy, anything really
<lowfn> Nittany_Discord: Songs?
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: 'shizu' always pings me
<Shizuka> 13why so ping
<Reikim> And every time I go to a con, the ponies sell out before an hour's up.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno.
<lowfn> Nittany_Discord: Hurt yourself?
<Soul> i just lost carpet fuel for master Popo! D:
*ShadowQuill laughs at Soul for not noticing that I have escaped back into oblivion
<Dken2021> Nittany_Discord hell, somehow that one asian girl that stares at the camera isa partner
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> >go to con > can't buy ponies >wut
<Lunar_Brony> I see no "shizu"
<Lunar_Brony> . . . oh! I get it now
<Lunar_Brony> --(\
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01lowfn: WAT?!!??!?!?!?
<Reikim> Seriously
<GabeMoist> Nittany can get a group of miads to sing barber shop while chasing tornadoes
<flutter_spin> But I don't expect people to read them. I casually post the link places. I'm constantly working and reworking them
<Jim> people hoard them ponies?
<Reikim> Last one I went to, there was this girl selling amazing plushies
<otakon> Shizuka: hiya dear, how are you?
<GabeMoist> I'd pay for that
<CriticKitten> Shizu: I sowwy. :( We were just talking about how you originally planned to do Ep 3 Rifftrax tonight, but we hadn't seen you at all and thought maybe you were too busy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist: That actually would be awesome.
<Reikim> She sold out within an hour, no joke.
<Lunar_Brony> lowfn was that supposed to be advise?
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Reikim> And she had quite a few.
<Shizuka> 13no because comcast is too flaky
<Shizuka> 13sorry :<
<Sumica> 00,10huh ping
<CriticKitten> No worries.
<lowfn> Lunar_Brony: Yes
*kirz|art sneaks into the Shizu-cave and noms the interwebs
<flutter_spin> HI Sumica :)
<Reikim> At the very least I take heart in the fact that she made money and will proceed to make more plushies.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Vaaaaaaaaaaaalve y u no make the Point and Shoot paintable! Why?!
<otakon> Shizuka: that sucks dear
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/Tt7QQcKf_eQ
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh god
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica pong
<CriticKitten> I have Comcast too and I know how much it sucks. >_>
<Reikim> What's that?
<Dken2021> nice how you can make billions off this franchise
<Chains> Anypony up for some Shreddies?
<CriticKitten> So no worries!
<twilight_sprinkle> ping All the mods
<Soul> would anyone like to give up their soul?
<flutter_spin> Just saying how you are my favorite mod
<Reikim> Hasbro doesn't even seem to understand what they've got, potentially.
<Chains> Soul: Sure
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix NONONONO!!!! I don't know how my friend can watch that, but I can't! I just can't!!
<Dken2021> make some fanart/plusies, instant money
<Reikim> if you're good at it, anyway
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lunar_Brony, Age?
<tigher1001> hi
<Lunar_Brony> 15
<Dken2021> yea, there's that
<Lunar_Brony> hi tigher1001
<Soul> yay! now master Popo won't kill me! :D
<flutter_spin> I'm 27
<CrimsonPhoenix> That would be unlikely but a possibility
<twilight_sprinkle> im 98
<cachi01> ............ www.mediafire.com/?le7eliso7b7icde
<kirz|art> they look at a time vs payoff ratio, and unless a company can come up with a way to automate or streamline the plushie process well enough, we likely won't get high quality ones like the customs
<Chains> I'm Eleventy.
<cachi01> OOPS WRONG LINK
<flutter_spin> HOW DARE YOU
<cachi01> NOOO
<cachi01> SORRY
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: lemme guess, the game?
<Chains> cachi01: WHAT IS THAT
<cachi01> wrong link dammi
<Dken2021> cachi01 if that's the evo build, think you made a wrong move
<cachi01> tFUCKL
<flutter_spin> don't click it!
<Chains> GUD
<ShadowQuill> Soul, did you know that I am still in oblivion?
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: hitler could change to good, thats how strong ponies are
<cachi01> DONT CLICK IT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think I made a new friend today. Maybe she can help me get through this hard time.
<RaveBrony> :\
<Reikim> Ah well
<kirz|art> I think Hasbro is ok with the custom market, they just don't like it when people start profiteering off of their franchise
*lowfn resisting the urge to click cachi01 's link
<DocSane> The thing about hanging out on Bronystate is you constantly have to ask peoples' ages, because the age range here is so wide.
<flutter_spin> Pinkie Pie finally catch up with you Nit?
<owloysius> he was the guy that killed hitler after all.
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: you are corrupt. you must be crucified. any last words?
<Soul> ShadowQuill, I did notice, get back in the jar!
<Reikim> Has that happened before?
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: WHY NOT
<DocSane> You never know if you're talking to someone in middle age or middle school.
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: first of all what are you looking for, part time of full time job?
<ShadowQuill> Soul: NO! I am in oblivion!
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: sorry world AND FUCK YOU COPY PASTE BUTTON
<lowfn> DocSane: Nice wordplay
<kirz|art> it's happening now, with the current community
<Sumica> 00,10So how goes the storry flutter_spin?
<Dken2021> pretty much with any other franchise with a large fanbase
*DocSane takes a bow.
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: Why shouldn't we click on it?!
<kirz|art> a lot of people into it solely for the money, which is what they have an issue with
<Dken2021> and talented artist
*twilight_sprinkle crucifies cachi01
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01superretroworld: Something not fast-paced.
<flutter_spin> Pretty good. I've extended the first story of "Drocsid" from 16,000 words to about 23,000 words
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: DONT DO IT
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill it's the leakes Fighting is Magic
<Lunar_Brony> *leaked
<Reikim> ...Why am I finding out so many horrible things today?
<lowfn> TELL ME WHATS ON THAT LINK RIGHT NOW YOUNG MAN!
<RaveBrony> The poor makers of Fighting is Magic..... having their trust betrayed like that.....
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: BUT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT
<twilight_sprinkle> lowfn: what Lunar_Brony said
<Soul> ShadowQuill if you don't get back in the jar master Popo will punish both of us! D:
<flutter_spin> I've also developed a new language to add to the third story
<Lunar_Brony> lowfn it's the leaked Fighting is Magic
<flutter_spin> Just a little decipher code, mostly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Part-time would be preferable.
<ShadowQuill> Soul: I DON'T CAAARE
<lowfn> :O
<Jim> Because you're adopted!
<RaveBrony> I refuse to click on the link in respect to the creators
<Jim> jokes :P
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: Was that link... illegal?!
<Reikim> o_o
<lowfn> Only evils play leaked games
<flutter_spin> ShadowQuill: There is a giant thread revolving around the leaked file
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: well if your looking for one, then atleast your trtying, just remember that
<Lunar_Brony> Soul Jar master? Why would the sniper care?
<Soul> i feel like i'd be btraying mane6 if i downloaded it
<twilight_sprinkle> flutter_spin: where?
<ShadowQuill> OMGOMG ITS REAL ITS REAL OMG
<twilight_sprinkle> flutter_spin: on /mlp/?
<NullRadix> ShadowQuill: technically no, you made to agreement with the FiM team. However, it wasn't there wish for it to be released. You may choose to respect their wishes or not
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> cause you touch yourself at night ?
<Jmo4267> You're all muffins.
<Reikim> Four things today in the pony fandom have made me sad
<flutter_spin> https://boards.4chan.org/mlp/res/3634340
<NullRadix> their wish*
<Thrackerzod> hellow :3
<lowfn> I feel like I'd be btraying Lauren if I downloadededededeededeed it
<Reikim> Grargh
<ShadowQuill> NullRadix: For respect, I WILL NOT DOWNLOAD IT
<Reikim> Oh no wait, five
<Reikim> Five things
<flutter_spin> Don't worry. The thread is superlong. You have to dig for that link
<Dken2021> pretty much a reason why I hate people who do fanart for the sole reason to get people to look at their art
*Soul highfives ShadowQuill
<Reikim> > kirz is hanging up his mod hat
<Dken2021> or anything in general
<DocSane> Holy crap, Comcast just gave me a MAJOR internet speed boost.
<Reikim> > Fighting is Magic got leaked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01superretroworld: Seeking vocational rehabilitation.
<ShadowQuill> Soul: YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHH
<Lunar_Brony> flutter_spin I saw it without scrolling
<twilight_sprinkle> flutter_spin: should be an entrtaining read
<Reikim> > I only just now find out about the Equestria Online incident
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're going to help me.
<DocSane> I now recorded 50 Mbps down and 10 Mbps up.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I had an appointment with them Friday.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Last Friday.
<flutter_spin> Well they are trying to delete certain links in the thread.
<flutter_spin> But people keep posting new ones
<lowfn> Who here has seen the Weakest Link?
<Reikim> > I find out I missed the writing submission deadline for Legends of Equestria by a few short days because I never found out about it beforehand
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dken2021 here has scootaloo http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/214/e/b/scoota__drums_by_ponycharacter-d59ksof.png
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cachi01: Please do not link that game here.
<Reikim> > People are profiteering off of ponies
<Soul> i cant stand links
<lowfn> Silence will fall
<Reikim> It has been a horrible day for my inner fanboy.
<Soul> all they do is hurt people
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: thats good
<Buytoast> why would anybody download a pony based fighting game
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: NO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Any further links to the Fighting is Magic leak will be treated as a spoiler and punished as such.
<DocSane> cachi01: Show some resolve and respect for the dev team and don't spread that copy around.
<flutter_spin> heh. I bet cachi01 will remember this like Spongebob losing his pants in "Hooked"
<superretroworld> :)
<ShadowQuill> Buytoast: Because
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I.E. Instant 24-hr ban.
<RaveBrony> Yay :)
<twilight_sprinkle> internet explorer= 24 hr ban?:O
<Reikim> Very nice, Trix!
<CriticKitten> O.o
<flutter_spin> oh. um. ok. Sorry.
<lowfn> ShadowQuill: Yes, now turn around and youll forget youve ever had this very longconversation
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope
<CriticKitten> I didn't even know the game HAD been leaked.
<Soul> not only does it hurt the creators, it also starts flame wars
<Vordox> Have some FUN stuff
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8L8ubez6vA
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: wait did you go to it or did you miss it?
<CriticKitten> Uh....how exactly did that happen?
*lowfn teleports away from ShadowQuill
*twilight_sprinkle afk
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: I DON'T WANNA
<Reikim> It is far better than much that I have seen and you had better take that compliment like a man
<DocSane> CriticKitten: A testor broke his NDA.
<flutter_spin> The problem is that the story is getting out and um, I have a bad habit of finding out things
<NullRadix> CriticKitten: QA member leaked it. I think there's a link on EQD
<Reikim> Do you trace or sketch?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01superretroworld: Already went.
<NullRadix> CriticKitten: FiM team released a response letter
<DocSane> CriticKitten: As a result, the dev team cancelled the beta test program.
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: Good enough. I just defecated in twilight_sprinkle's home yet again.
<superretroworld> Nittany_Discord: oh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're getting my records together.
<Soul> and now we cant have BSAs
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> both(?)
<CriticKitten> This is why we can't have nice things.
<Soul> *BSUs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll see them again at the end of this month.
<Buytoast> that's what you get for trusting people
<DocSane> CriticKitten: Precisely.
<flutter_spin> I don't even know if I should be talking about you-know-what
<lowfn> MUST UST HOUS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BSUs?
<DocSane> Bite Sized Updates
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord Bite-Sized Updates
<Reikim> Open for a bit of advice that should maybe be taken with a grain of salt from a guy who is not a professional?
*lowfn goes and dusts twilight_sprinkle 's home and everything in it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> define trace :p
<Reikim> Tracing over existing art
*lowfn then dusts ShadowQuill 's face and runs teleports away
<Reikim> Does not include copy-drawing.
<Lunar_Brony> basically, a post explaining progress n' stuff
<Thrackerzod> anything gonna happen tonight?
<Jim> Were you going to draw Sweetie and Applebloom too TheGreatAndPowerfulT ?
<Soul> someone just HAD to be famous
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: I have yet again defecated all throughout your household.
<CriticKitten> They did a good job with the art.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> when i feel like it (?) dunno i draw at random
<cachi01> again

<Reikim> Okay, actually, two
<Jim> I can see forever
<Quick_Thinker> time travel?
<Allegr0> Kandarihu: so is Guild wars 2
<CriticKitten> Apparently you enter portals and go Stargate SG 1 on people's asses.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02I'm not streaming o.o
<flutter_spin> Yeah. The problem is I've been holding onto the game case for about 6 months for my brother
<Kandarihu> Woah, that's one heck of a loading screen.
<Chains> cachi01: lol i see my text
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: Whaaat? :o
<Thrackerzod> who is streaming then?
<flutter_spin> Now... ugh!
<Jim> Who IS streaming?
*Lunar_Brony scratches his chin
<cachi01> Chains: lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Double tap then
<Reikim> First, I think you could benefit from working on sketching technique abit.
<Chains> :D
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: Mer? Not entirely.
<flutter_spin> lol Bronysith
<Soul> oUo
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord U streamin'?
<Chains> BUFFER
<Chains> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Kandarihu> Hey Sumica, are you looking forward to Phantasy Star Online 2?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nope.
<Reikim> Like, as in, sketching lines with the pencil
<Chains> Good timing
<RustyMeat> stream has been hacked :o
<Ponies47> Bronysith: Have fun with that. She's gonan be at Canterlot Gardens in September. I might be goign to that :P
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: well, it is, but also not really ;)
<Ponies47> *Gonna
<Reikim> That or use a different hardness pencil; some erased lines show
<Ponies47> *Going
<cachi01> stream is being leaked
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek|Observiking . . . are you even at the computer?
<Quick_Thinker> canterlot gardens is gonna be a blast
<RaveBrony> I dont want to see Tara.... I want to See TABITHA!! :'(
<lowfn> STREAM IS HACKED?!
<Dken2021> perhaps it's shizu?
<Reikim> Plus getting curves right, but that's really just a lot of practice.
<ShadowQuill> What will be the thing you guys can't wait for: Season 3, Double Rainboom fanmade episode, SWAG.MOV, or the My Little Dashie movie?
<flutter_spin> Can't tell. It could be any pony playing
<Soul> ...sumica?
<Reikim> Second, do you use an undersketch?
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka U streamin'?
<CriticKitten> Allegr0: Tera's ....weird. It's like if WoW and GW2 had an unwanted child.
<flutter_spin> none of those ShadowQuill
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: IKR? So I might see you there :3
<ShadowQuill> flutter_spin: OH COME ON
<Shizuka> 13not streaming
<otakon> well that was short lived
<Quick_Thinker> they are actually making a my little dashie movie im sorry but it will fail badly
<Soul> O.O
<lowfn> Everypony abandon stream abandon stream!
<Kandarihu> So someone who wasn't a mod was streaming that?
<CriticKitten> Well, no. I should say....it's like if WoW and GW2 had an orgy with every single Korean MMO on the planet.
<Allegr0> CriticKitten: yeah, I've heard VERY mixed things about the game, om both extremes
<flutter_spin> I never read My Little Dashie. MOV is a bit gross for me. Double Rainbow... is fine, but "can't wait"
<ShadowQuill> Quick_Thinker: And WHY do you think THAT?!
<Dken2021> maybe... it was a ghost
<cachi01> CriticKitten: yeah but that baby ends up beating one of his gfathers and competing against the other one
<Soul> MOV?
<AttacktheAndalite> Maybe it was prince-dari. He does like trolling us
<flutter_spin> Now Season 3 gets me excited, but I want to finish my fanfic first
<otakon> IT WAS A GHOST!
<otakon> GIGGLE AT IT!
<RaveBrony> ^
*Jim giggles
<CriticKitten> cachi01: lolwat?
<Quick_Thinker> its hard to capture emotions of that story IN A MOVIE THINGS CHANGE WHEN YOUR MAKING AMOVIE
*kirz|art giggles at otakon
*Soul giggles at the ghostie
<Spectrum_Rush> why is everyone freaking out wha was on stream?
*ShadowQuill laughs evilly
<cachi01> CriticKitten: this is better than WoW
<Ponies47> Wait there is gonna be a My Little Dashie movie? O.O
*RaveBrony giggles at Jim, otakon, and Soul
<Sumica> 00,10so many pings
<cachi01> CriticKitten: but its competing against GW2
<Reikim> Only asking because I can't tell; it's hard sometimes to guess the process from the end product.
<flutter_spin> lol Sumica :)
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: Eeyup
<Ponies47> Hi Sumi
<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: When is it coming out?
<Kandarihu> I would like to know if any of the mods are looking forward to PSO2, so that it might get streamed when it comes out.
<Lunar_Brony> lets see, that leaves BaconMane, prince-dari, Saturn, Tom, VioletVanilla, Wrek|Observiking, Allegr0 (I'm thinking a bot tho), or Phase4 to be streaming. Who is it?
<CriticKitten> cachi01: Technically it's competing with WoW, GW2, Aion, SWTOR, Rift....
<Soul> sumica were you streaming?
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: SOON
<CriticKitten> Well, all of those EXCEPT GW2.
<Sumica> 00,10streaming what?
<Allegr0> Lunar_Brony: I'm not a bot :P
<kirz|art> except for the ones that aren't out or already ded
<Kandarihu> Sumica, Tera
<Soul> o.o'
<superretroworld> ShadowQuill: is it independent/fan made or an actual movie?
<flutter_spin> Seriously, I got what I wanted from Target already. I can't wait for my brother to play with me. THAT is what I want.
<CriticKitten> Since TERA is a subscription game and GW2 isn't.
<ponibas> I could stream something, but I am not even suppsed to acknoledge being in the beta :/
<Soul> who streamed?
<Lunar_Brony> Allegr0 oh, sorry! I've never seen you before. Were you streaming?
<cachi01> CriticKitten: i thnk a friend told me about Aion is that the one with 3 worlds?? and each world with its own castle??
<ShadowQuill> Quick_Thinker: Why on Earth or in Equestria would you think that the My Little Dashie movie would FAIL?!
<Allegr0> Lunar_Brony: nope :P
<Dken2021> superretroworld I'm guessing indie
<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY! I'M SEEING IT IN THEATERS! I DON'T CARE! Wait. It's not gonna be in theaters is it? :P
<Sumica> 00,10I could stream tera if you want.
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Quick_Thinker> a my little dashie movie willl be hard to make the story we could read his thoughts and his feeling when you fo that with a movie it turns into quite a mess and can make the story seem sloppy
<Bronysith> Sumica: thats kewl
<Reikim> 'Lo?
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica oh you.
<CriticKitten> cachi01: Dunno, but TERA is a subscription game and it's not really in direct competition with GW2.
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: Err... no.
<Dken2021> maybe... it was Tom
<kirz|art> nice thing about GW2, ArenaNet feels no need to get in a pissing contest with Blizzard, which will make for a better game in the end
<Chains> Anypony up for some Nesquik?
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: BUT IT MIGHT
<JESmith71> It wouldn't be in theaters since it's based off of a fanfic
<Soul> Tom?
<Jim> EL O
<cachi01> CriticKitten: ooooh its subscription game... damn it
<Sumica> 00,10would probably be boreing to watch though
<Reikim> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Hello?
<Kandarihu> Quick_Thinker, it's basically the same barrier as every visual novel being adapted into an anime series ever.
<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: Like I said. If it does. I'M SEEING IT! I DON'T CARE WAIT THEY SAY! I'M SEEING IT!
<ShadowQuill> Quick_Thinker: The main character also has a narration, so problem solved.
<CriticKitten> cachi01: GW2 was set up somewhat smartly, it doesn't have to compete with WoW or the others because it's a $60 always-available game.
<flutter_spin> My brother and I WILL play Guild Wars 2... as soon as we play Portal 2, Star Wars: Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online: Rohan, Minecraft.....
<Dken2021> Soul thing that announces episode time
<Allegr0> kirz|art: yup, they're very much looking out the the health of the game, and the fans who don't bitch and whine
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: I AM WITH YOU
*Spectrum_Rush is so confus
<Lunar_Brony> Soul I've asked all the mods if they were streaming. I'm thinking it was Sumica.
<CriticKitten> cachi01: TERA on the other hand will need to do battle with WoW, Rift, and other established subscription games for players, and they will lose that battle.
<Lunar_Brony> but I don't know for sure . . .
<kirz|art> I can't wait for it, loved the beta weekends
<Jim> I'm going to play GW2 so hard
<Soul> sumica said he didnt
<Quick_Thinker> also another thing is its a bad idea to make a movie based on that i mean sure the story has emotions and some confilcts but othe then that i cant see it working
<flutter_spin> Right now, Starcraft 2 is undergoing technical issues with 1.5
<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: I will go to theater in my brony shirt I DON'T CARE! I WILL GO SEE IT BY MYSELF IF I HAVE TO!
<JESmith71> If For Want of a Dawn or Sunset weren't grimdark, they would make good movies
<flutter_spin> So that game is out for the time being
<Lunar_Brony> Soul oh . . . crap.
<Sumica> 00,10Actaly i never said it was't me =p
<Sumica> 00,10trololol
*Reikim shrugs
<ShadowQuill> I MUST SEE MY LITTLE DASHIE MOVIE! It even has its own site!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim i have this http://i49.tinypic.com/zu0ff6.jpg , i have no technique whatsoever, and i don't even know what is an undersketch
<ShadowQuill> Ponies47: YEAH!
<Jim> kirz|art, There was a 4 hour stress test today actually :P
<Reikim> Oi, then knowing it would help
<Quick_Thinker> Ponies47 its not going to be in theaters that thakes millions of dollars
<Reikim> Okay
<Reikim> How to explain this...
<Reikim> ...
<Soul> i thought you did.... XD
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica is best Bronystate troll.
<kirz|art> ...
<Reikim> btw I like your eraser
<Ponies47> Quick_Thinker: You never know. But yeah your right :P
*kirz|art hates work
<flutter_spin> I didn't get into Guild Wars 2 beta. I didn't preorder and the keys went out in like a minute.
*ShadowQuill poops the word YEAH on the ground in twilight_sprinkle's house
<CriticKitten> Oh, right, the stress test.
*lowfn dusts the poop
<CriticKitten> I totally forgot. Not like it matters though.
*Soul cleans off the poop
<flutter_spin> But Secret World is free this weekend!
<ShadowQuill> Soul: YOU FAIL. It is uncleanable
<Reikim> And no sarcasm there, it's a nice eraser, I wish I had an eraser like that
<CriticKitten> I already know how I feel about it.
<flutter_spin> I do want to do that!
<otakon> woah woah what?
<Soul> get in the jar!
<Reikim> Okay
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't :p i make smudges too often
<otakon> stop that
<ShadowQuill> Soul: BUCK NO

<flutter_spin> no stings. lol. THE BEES!
<Allegr0> Lunar_Brony: please let there be no stings attached
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: Can I join to!?! :D
<Jim> Found a little easteregg in GW2 today http://i.imgur.com/BuR1l.jpg :P
<Reikim> Anything - ANYTHING - can be broken down into basic shapes.
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: WHAT?! OH MY BUCKING GOD THIS IS AMAZING
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 do you hate work?
<CriticKitten> cachi01: Oh one more thing. TERA is heavily hyped for its combat, but....honestly? It feels like a more clunky version of GW2 combat to me.
<flutter_spin> hahahahaah
<flutter_spin> Jim. Nice.
<Lunar_Brony> Allegr0 no stings either.
<Allegr0> Lunar_Brony: good :P
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: I bucking hate work. -_-
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: DAMN I GOT STUNG

<ShadowQuill> HEY WAKE UP
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill work lover . . .
<Science_Brony> ShadowQuill SCIENCE!!!!1!!
<Reikim> If you take away all the fancy details - hair, eyes, nose, mouth, fingers, toes, etc - then the body can be visualized as a series of three-dimensional shapes interacting.
<Science_Brony> awake?
<CriticKitten> I played the trial of TERA and was like "wait, this is the highly toted combat? Can I go back to GW2 now?"
<Dken2021> science?
*flutter_spin hugs my Crystal Set http://www.mylittleponynews.com/2012/05/pony-rainbow-collection-translucent.html
<ShadowQuill> Science_Brony: WHAT HAPPEN
<Shooeie> What we watching?
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill I yelled in your ear
<cachi01> http://mylittledashie-movie.tumblr.com/
<Lunar_Brony> hi Shooeie. ATM, nothing
<Jim> We're not watching anything as far as I can see, Shooeie
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: I farted on twilight_sprinkle's toast. BEAT THAT
<Reikim> An undersketch is a sketch you do before filling out all the details. It's basically taking your subject and breaking it down into something more easily processed.
<flutter_spin> wait a second. I remember something. Hangon ShadowQuill . Let me find the link
<Dken2021> ShadowQuill and that acomplishes?
<DocSane> Do we REALLY need a My Little Dashie movie? Really?
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill I have a Muffin Cannon and Mini-Muffin Gatling Gun, both of which I built myself.
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane yes. Yes we do.
<ShadowQuill> Dken2021: EVERYTHING
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sooo skeleton ?
<Shooeie> A My Little Dashie movie?
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: :O
<DocSane> Do we really need to see an alegory of some lonely fan wishing he had a pony as a daughter?
<ShadowQuill> Shooeie: Yup
<Soul> im gonna go, see ya at movie night!
<Jim> cya Soul
<Reikim> For such things as ponies and humans, it allows you to get proportions/poses/perspective down before it gets really complicated, which is nice because it's easier to correct such things without lots of detail.
<Lunar_Brony> seeya Soul
<Reikim> A bit like a skeleton.
<ShadowQuill> DocSane: Oh, stop being pessimistic.
<Reikim> So, a head.
<DocSane> Later, Soul
<Dken2021> y'know what movie I'm interested in seeing complete? Zero Charisma
<cachi01> DocSane: no we dont but you know...
<DocSane> ShadowQuill: I'm ALWAYS pessimistic when it comes to fanfic.
<Reikim> A head would start as a circle, and then built on to make the rest of it.
<ShadowQuill> BYE Soul
<Dken2021> seeya soul
<Reikim> An arm is two cylinders joined by a sphere.
<ShadowQuill> DocSane: Erm... okay?
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane being pissimistic is my shtick!
<flutter_spin> ugh! I can't find it. It was a pic of Rarity in a potatoe
<Lunar_Brony> so STFU
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: Heh heh heh, you said PISSimistic
<Reikim> The torso is a bigger, squatter cylinder bonded to a pyramid-thingy by a ball.
<Reikim> And so on.
<Chains> Bye everypony
<Lunar_Brony> seeya Chains
<DocSane> Because for every well-written story, there's ten mediocre ones, twenty mastabatory ones, and then the one or two ones that are just outright sickening.
<Dken2021> http://www.indiegogo.com/zerocharismamovie here's a trailer for it btw
<ShadowQuill> flutter_spin: IN A POTATO?!
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill I'm too lazy to correct it
<flutter_spin> lol yeah ShadowQuill . It was funny.
<Quick_Thinker> well im not being a pessimist im just saying the idea for movie on my little dashie sounds nice on paper but its going to be a bitch to pull it off
<Reikim> Undersketches are really nice because they save time and make things prettier in the end.
<flutter_spin> I can keep searching, if you want
<Chains> *Ahem* Bai, everypony! ^-^
<Dken2021> seeya Chains
<Quick_Thinker> bai Chains
<Allegr0> see ya Chains
<Ponies47> Bye Chains
<DocSane> I keep imagining a poorly shot video with some dude in his studio apartment with a CGI Rainbow Dash in a box.
<ShadowQuill> Quick_Thinker: They have a lot of brony artists and the movie is almost finished
<Reikim> With a pony, it would look somethign like this: http://www.bmloeffelman.com/pictures/MLP/quick_undersketch.jpg
<ShadowQuill> DocSane: Well, that is not what it will be like at all.
<DocSane> It'll be very sincere and almost unwatchable.
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill already? Wow, I just learned about it today
<Reikim> None of these lines will make it into the final product, but they're just as (if not more) important than the many little details that will come later.
<Quick_Thinker> well artists dont matter you need DIRECTORS AND PEOPLE WITH FILM EXPERIENCE
<kirz|art> btw, hate those back legs
<Reikim> Bitch and a half, I know.
<DocSane> ShadowQuill: And what will it be like?
<ShadowQuill> DocSane: Lies. It will not be anything like that.
<Dken2021> and actors
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane please take your negativity elsewhere. Also, nom on this muffin
<Reikim> I usually just look hard at it and take a wild guess.
*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin at DocSane
<Jim> Talking about GW2, they had a Brony reference in one of their official videos recently: http://youtu.be/BCNxPTgrIHQ?t=33s
<kirz|art> yeah, half the time they come out perfect, half the time they're a complete mess
<DocSane> Okay, okay, it could be good. It MIGHT be good.
<Reikim> Anyway yeah, undersketches.
<ShadowQuill> DocSane: Well, I don't know, butt i will be MUCH BETTER than you think it is!
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: Where do you get all thes muffins!?! :D
<ShadowQuill> *but not ass
<Ponies47> *these
<Reikim> Fundamental artistic skill. Mastering the undersketch is a massive leap forward for graphic artists.
<DocSane> I'm just saying that the odds are that it won't be.
<rinshiShiZuKaNo> hey everyone!
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 Luna baked them
<Lunar_Brony> hi rinshiShiZuKaNo
<Reikim> Less important for classical or abstract/non-objective artists.
<lowfn> Could I haz a muffin?
<Ponies47> Lunar_Brony: O.O
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Will try to use it, but can't promise anything
<lowfn> :)
*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin at lowfn and Ponies47
<Reikim> If I could give you one tip, I'd tell you to use undersketches.
<Reikim> Seriously, they're that important.
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit ShadowQuill , have you been pooping on my house again????
*Ponies47 Noms on the Lunar_Brony muffin
*lowfn allows muffin to slide past his teeth through his throat and into his belly which is lined with taste buds
*Ponies47 Wonders what ever happend to the 1 Shane377 guy
<Reikim> Circles come out rounder, legs come out the right length, and eyes get placed properly in the head.
<Quick_Thinker> also you need a very good set and hell the set will be mostly a house and the outside that will be east but the actors will the angles will be the toughest to do you have to get angle right in the movie or else it feels like a mess
<rinshiShiZuKaNo> im new to bronystate whats up
<Dken2021> lali-ho rinshiShiZuKaNo
<Jim> Welcome to Bronystate rinshiShiZuKaNo !
<Dken2021> nothing much
<ShadowQuill> DocSane: STOP BEING PESSIMISTIC! Being a pessimist means you think that just because it has not been made yet, it will be awful! Us optimists have a better thought on life! For example, we think of twilight_sprinkle's house as half FULL of poop, not half empty!
<otakon> rinshiShiZuKaNo: did ya read the rules and welcome
<Reikim> With the right understanding of a pony's underketch, you can draw it in any pose whatsoever without reference.
<Ponies47> Well welcome to bronystate rinshiShiZuKaNo!
<superretroworld> rinshiShiZuKaNo: welcome to the herd
<Dken2021> ShadowQuill uh, he left
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dunno been use this one sometimes http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7bS-XNQmBnk/TeX7B0XqZMI/AAAAAAAAFTE/AWktwZT1XAA/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg

<Lunar_Brony> rinshiShiZuKaNo currently, the stream is down, we're welcoming you, and I am throwing muffins.
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: thats it. im calling satan to t ake you to hell
*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin at rinshiShiZuKaNo
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: Luna baked?
*Jmo4267 ditches muffins at Lunar_Brony
<Jmo4267> You're a muffin.
<Celes_Chere> I has lightning out my window ._.
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: NO WAIT
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill of course
<Reikim> That's just an image, right
<Reikim> ?
<Quick_Thinker> and we are also talking about a my little dashie movie
<kirz|art> yeah
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: I CAN CHANGE
<Dken2021> Celes_Chere she might want an elixer
<Reikim> God my connection sucks
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: <.<

<Canadian_Brony> Jmo4267 sorry, who is a muffin?
<Jmo4267> You're a muffin.
<ShadowQuill> Quick_Thinker: And an evil pessimist whom I was arguing fiercely with just left!
<Jmo4267> ;D
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: your on thin ice. i have my hand on the phone to satan
<Celes_Chere> Dken2021: Dam, all I have are Hi-Potions
<Reikim> Need to see
*lowfn begins to dust the destruction ShadowQuill has casued
<Reikim> I don't draw ponies nearly often enough
<rinshiShiZuKaNo> i did read the rules i had some help from a good friend he told me to be chill i am postive you know him!
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: WHAT'S HIS NUMBER?!
<Reikim> What I really wish I could draw is trees. That would be very nice...
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: ill never tell.
<lowfn> ShadowQuill: 666-666-1337
<Quick_Thinker> and who is this friend?
<ShadowQuill> lowfn: I leveled buildings while arguing?
<Thrackerzod> Nittany_Discord you have been followed :3
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: IT IS 666
<kirz|art> all depends on how much detail you're getting into :3
<lowfn> ShadowQuill: Yes and Im dusting the agrued air
<rinshiShiZuKaNo> fluttercry!!
<Reikim> Ooh
<Shizuka> 13oh joy... someone whose nick pings me...

<Reikim> Although when actually drawing you have to make allowances for personal style.
<twilight_sprinkle> ShadowQuill: well alrighty then?
<kirz|art> we had it linked in the art dept skype group for new people, and I have it saved locally for when I need a ref
<rinshiShiZuKaNo> yes he just got me hoked on mlp i love it!!
<lowfn> twilight_sprinkle: Me and him have a deal... I am stuck dusting as my job.. I stay outta hell
<Reikim> My ponies always come out looking vaguely manga-ish...my fault for drawing the same thing for years >.>
<Reikim> Saving this pic in Reference and never deleting it
<Reikim> ...As soon as it finishes loading.
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka I would hope so. What good would your nick be if you weren't pinged by it?
<ShadowQuill> twilight_sprinkle: That was Satan's message to you. He says not to send me to hell, because I will poop so much I will return to Earth.
<twilight_sprinkle> lowfn: im his personal human psychologist, i report my findings to him in letter every week, thats my deal
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and kirz link it to me
<ShadowQuill> HOLY FARTNUGGETS BATMAN!

<ShadowQuill> Quick_Thinker: OOH!
<flutter_spin> Maybe I should get a tumblr? naw...
<PinkiePieCopy> superretroworld: Amnesia. Dark descent. pokerface.
<lowfn> I never seen Scott Pilgrim vs The World! But Ive always wanted to!

<Lunar_Brony> I don't even blog
<Shizuka> 13thankfully the extreme hills biome i live in is nice and big, with three strongholds at the edge

<superretroworld> ShadowQuill: that songs in yts most popular videos atm
<Reikim> (aside from tossing them the occasional exploding kittens, but whatever)
<Jim> SuperBrony got a server that's allways up, but I'm not sure if it's working correctly after the patch now
<Reikim> So much practiiiice
<ShadowQuill> Bronysith: I... just heard about it! I didn't mean to make anyone angry! :'(
<flutter_spin> There are some really nice wallpapers this time around
<kirz|art> I think I've played the free version of minecraft once, but I don't think I would pay $30 for it
<flutter_spin> http://owlet57.deviantart.com/art/Style-Rarity-315690158 is cool
<Buytoast> I'm always angry
<Buytoast> and an asshole
<Quick_Thinker> PEOPLE IN COD SANG TO A PONY SONG I AM SURPRISED AS YOU
<Reikim> *coughCRACKEDVERSIONcough*
<Jim> It costs $30 now??
<RosePetal> Love Rarity.
<kirz|art> last I checked
<Jim> I bought it for like 10
<Reikim> The other reason I don't play much...makes me uneasy.
<Lunar_Brony> lowfn a kid who gets a girfriend, but for one bucked up reason or another, he has to defeat her 7 exes in combat. He also has a gay roommate.
<twilight_sprinkle> lowfn: sooo did you check out the puzzle?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> $26

<PinkiePieCopy> Buytoast: Asshole? IN THE BATHROOM.
<Bronysith> ShadowQuill: you know the fluttershy emote doesnt help your cause
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SAI iirc
<Reikim> SAI?
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuNX2azWRQ Did someone say SING?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> same as wrek
<Reikim> What's that?
<kirz|art> I've been using Sai most often lately, but I have GIMP, Inkscape, and Photoshop Elements set up as well for different stuff
<lowfn> twilight_sprinkle: I have no idea.. I forgot how I did after I watched a couple seconds of that Picture Perfect Pony video
<ShadowQuill> flutter_spin: That was awesome.
<Reikim> What is Sai?
<twilight_sprinkle> lowfn: riiiiiiiiite
<Barbetos|Quakecon> dERP
<Barbetos|Quakecon> Whoa
<Barbetos|Quakecon> Caps on
<lowfn> flutter_spin: :D
<Quick_Thinker> i have bacon hair the drunk singer and my iphone i have a recording of him singing the theme drunk
*PinkiePieCopy sends ShadowQuill to a bowser space and makes him lose his coins. problem?
<Vordox> flutter_spin: Did you say sing?! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvNLjOuYSFQ
<kirz|art> http://sai.detstwo.com/sai/
<ShadowQuill> I love that one part in Picture Perfect Pony when Photo Finish won't leave Emerald May alone.
<Barbetos|Quakecon> I have only seen one other brony since I have gotten here =(
<Reikim> Another page I can take an hour loading =.=
<ShadowQuill> PinkiePieCopy: WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
<kirz|art> similar to illustrator, it's set up mainly for tablet interface
<Reikim> Most importantly, is it freeware or must I spend money?
*PinkiePieCopy then beats ShadowQuill in a minigame and becomes the superstar. Yays.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> $60 bucks
<Reikim> Oh tablet
<kirz|art> that link is the free version
<ShadowQuill> PinkiePieCopy: *uppercuts Bowser into lava* I WIN, BITCH
<flutter_spin> lol. good o' Yaplap
<Vordox> flutter_spin: Have some more FUN AND SONG AND SINGING LALALALa http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=lHr5mi9graw&NR=1
<Reikim> I am sadly not in a position to acquire a tablet...
<Shizuka> 13there's a demo mode for minecraft now
<Shizuka> 135 days per world
<kirz|art> well, works best with a tablet, but with practice I've seen people do good either way
<flutter_spin> I think I like his make on The Gala (because I love that song)
<superretroworld> Barbetos|Quakecon: did you say only one brony on here? as in bronystate?
*PinkiePieCopy makes ShadowQuill ShadowBowser so he nurns insnead.nnnnnnnnnnnnn
<Barbetos|Quakecon> No. Here at Quakecon
<Lunar_Brony> I lost some of my singing voice to puberty
<Reikim> ...Why not, I'll try it
<Quick_Thinker> also i could find a way to get this to the internet but i have been trying for month to decihper it so far all i got is my little ponys my little ponys ahahahhah my little pony u to think whay beer could be

<PinkiePieCopy> CCCP: No one has.
<CCCP> flutter_spin but i like the hidden means in that song
<CCCP> meanings*
<PinkiePieCopy> Guys I have a question for all of you
<Lunar_Brony> I still get shivers down my spine whenever I hear that song
<Thrackerzod> hey guys
<PinkiePieCopy> Do any of you have ONE IDEA of what mother 3 is?
<flutter_spin> Totally Lunar_Brony . I keep up with the deviantart. I like the filly flash animation she made.
<Buytoast> lucas
<Buytoast> pokey
<Buytoast> machines
<Lunar_Brony> Thrackerzod hi
<Buytoast> dystopia
<Vordox> Shooeie: I LOVe the comments :D
<Buytoast> that about right?
<Lunar_Brony> PinkiePieCopy uhh, no
<Vordox> Shooeie: "Was he actually hitting the notes""Lolnope"
<ShadowQuill> Rina Chan is a beautiful singer
<flutter_spin> oh oh oh and the wallpapers. Sheesh. Lunar_Brony , you've seen those right?
<ShadowQuill> And so is YapLap
<superretroworld> im still pissed mother 3 never got released outside of japan
<ShadowQuill>
<CCCP> about the music indusrtry and how people rush songs out flutter_spin
<Lunar_Brony> flutter_spin I haven't checked in a long time. TO THE INTERNET!!!
<Thrackerzod> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeqsIQzs8sw&feature=related if you havent seen it
<ShadowQuill>
<Lunar_Brony> *batman theme*
<twilight_sprinkle> Anyone wants a matchstick puzzle?
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/6255/
<ShadowQuill> WANNA KNOW THE MEANING OF LIFE?!
<flutter_spin> http://spiritto.deviantart.com/art/Ye-olde-Canterlot-308391873 is just awesome
<twilight_sprinkle> guess not :<
<Jim> ShadowQuill, 42
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill 42
<robokun> superretroworld: there's an AMAZING fan translation out there, and apparently translated with Nintendo's guidelines for a GBA game
<flutter_spin> Thrackerzod: I didn't like it, like the others. I just don't like them fighting like that. Seems... silly when comparing it to the song
<ShadowQuill> 42 is not the answer. The REAL answer is... wait for it...
<robokun> okay, is anyone casting or is mips.tv being stupid?
<ShadowQuill>
<pony_1530> Hallo!
<twilight_sprinkle> robokun: nothings on
<Lunar_Brony> hi pony_1530
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi pony_1530
<kirz|art> but for now, back to Shizupic
<Jim> hai pony_1530
<Vordox> Best Derpy tribute song. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc-YMUWvA1s&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&index=13&feature=plpp_video <----
<superretroworld> robokun: ik, but still its hard to get
<Jim> robokun, No stream ATM
<Reikim> her world
<Reikim> Looks like
<flutter_spin> The song didn't really do it for me Vordox
<ShadowQuill> Vordox: WAAAHAHHAHAAAAA
<ShadowQuill> SAD
<PinkiePieCopy> I am so freaking sad.
<PinkiePieCopy> No one knows what mother 3 is. :(
<flutter_spin> Then again, I don't care for The Aviators either
<Vordox> flutter_spin: You probably cannot connect to it then. :)
<PuddingCupz> Im installing steam :D
<Vordox> Who cares about the aviators? The lyrics
<Reikim> ...It's really weird, seeing what I've drawn from up close like this
<Reikim> the way the computer sees it.
<ShadowQuill> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E20jsywkLaY&feature=related Oh my...
<PuddingCupz> :$ Finally it wanted to work.
<Jim> PuddingCupz, Steam is good for you, but bad for your wallet
<flutter_spin> Now Tysolin remixes. I love that guy.
<Lunar_Brony> PinkiePieCopy it's an RPG for the GBA developed by Nintendo.
<PinkiePieCopy> Jim: Indeed. SMB is 15 bucks...
<kirz|art> btw Reikim, do you have a DA with stuff up? Not sure if I've seen your work before
<robokun> Jim: so true, especially during a sale
<Reikim> Never
<PinkiePieCopy> Lunar_Brony: Hm? LUNAR BRONY..... Y U NO SPEAK UP LAST 2 TIMES!?
<PuddingCupz> Nothing's airing D:
<Jim> oh yeah, I spent 130 Euro on the summer sale ::P
<Ponies47> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/6270/ :P
<robokun> BUY ALL THE GAMES!!!
<Reikim> I have a DA but I made it ages ago to converse with a fanfic buddy
<Lunar_Brony> PinkiePieCopy I just looked it up.
<flutter_spin> Yeah ShadowQuill . A little too weird for my taste. Not much pony without the video either
<PinkiePieCopy> Lunar_Brony: Oh. Then that doesn't count.
<Reikim> Never touched it, but I still get updates on some artists
<Jspang1> AttacktheAndalite: animorphs reference?
<ShadowQuill> But really, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E20jsywkLaY&feature=related is terrifying, but still. Ponies and dubstep
<Lunar_Brony> PinkiePieCopy at least I know what it is. I've never touched a GBA.
*PinkiePieCopy sits in a corner because no one knows what Mother 3 is...... with Kumatora.
<ShadowQuill> PinkiePieCopy: I SORTA MIGHT PROBABLY KNOW
<flutter_spin> Don't make me do it ~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MhqHCpBVKY&feature=player_embedded
<PinkiePieCopy> ShadowQuill: Orly.
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill did you google it?
<Lunar_Brony> like me?
<CriticKitten> Okay, so now I'm finally caught up on the whole leak ....thing. There, now I don't feel behind. >_>
<ShadowQuill> PinkiePieCopy: Months ago
<kirz|art> aw :( :P
<Jim> PinkiePieCopy, It's been streamed before here
<ShadowQuill> flutter_spin: THE HELL
<Vordox> Great dat damn Derpy made me sad...
<PinkiePieCopy> Jim: WHEN. WHAT.
<Vordox> SOME HAPPY SONG TIME! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LniRa3K2Tgw
<kirz|art> Utada has good music to art by :)
<flutter_spin> ShadowQuill: You know the reference, right?
<Reikim> I have exactly one pic I scanned for Alister because he wanted to see.
<RainBowJack> BEST SONG EVER http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdL4z5qfr4&list=FLVhqx62iPB434Y5xGi60vVA&index=7&feature=plpp_video
<kirz|art> and yes, I am being random today
<Jim> Mother 3 was streamed a loooong time ago
<Reikim> Random's good
<ShadowQuill> flutter_spin: Lollipop Chainsaw
<PinkiePieCopy> Jim: Well they need to do it again.
<Jim> I agree
<ShadowQuill> Vordox: I LOVE THAT SONG AND THE SERIES
<flutter_spin> yeah. Dan Vs FIM tumblr heh
<Lunar_Brony> RainBowJack I have that too man times
<Lunar_Brony> *seen that
<Quick_Thinker> not the best song ever but top noch animation and lip syching
<PinkiePieCopy> Jim: Best game EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Btw...... YOU FOUND A HOTSPRING I N A FUCKING TWO INCH PRESENT.
<ShadowQuill> RainBowJack: I already posted that link.
<RainBowJack> when i see Lollipop chiansaw i only hear TWILIGHT!!
<Thrackerzod> GOD DAMN MY FEELS I KNOW THEM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydbcr2KhD1Q&feature=channel&list=UL
<Jspang1> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbaGodU_Gkw
<Jspang1> tf2 anyone?
<Vordox> Thrackerzod: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9dFZJtQWc
<Reikim> What's the difference between a regular layer and a linework layer?
<kirz|art> linework is a vector layer
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIaIaoZvfvA&feature=g-vrec
<kirz|art> different set of options for it
<PuddingCupz> I want to be a oompa loompa, Take me to them so the deed can be done.
<Thrackerzod> Vordox seen it i just know discorsds feel in that song
<kirz|art> regular is bitmap
<flutter_spin> OH OH OH! I know! Someone should stream the Slenderman game: http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/07/26/slender-man-source-mod-will-let-you-scare-the-hell-out-of-yourself-for-free-with-friends/
<Vordox> Thrackerzod: Dat crazy fanon family
<Shooeie> So many links I cnat keep up
<Lunar_Brony> Shooeie IKR?
<Reikim> k, so nothing I need to worry about
<PuddingCupz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKiRIMDNj4A&feature=relmfu
<ShadowQuill> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVxtyaATq8 Pay close attention to the Lyras and Bon Bon
<Thrackerzod> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&list=ULYdbcr2KhD1Q&NR=1&v=4PjIhs72l0A
<kirz|art> not really, I only pop one up if I need a reference for lighting
<Vordox> ShadowQuill: Or Sethisto, or FLuffy, or Snails.
<Vordox> ShadowQuill: Or Flim
<RainBowJack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaSKYmpWXZw&feature=BFa&list=FLVhqx62iPB434Y5xGi60vVA when ever i hear this song i just get happy
<Jim> ALL the links
<ShadowQuill> Vordox: Yeah.
<kirz|art> draw out some line from a light source, and since they're vectors they're going to give you a straight-edge unless you mess with them
<PuddingCupz> Everyone: I am a pegasister but i would like to be called a brony :|
<Shooeie> Here is a robot fight for ya
<flutter_spin> Now you see, THAT Rainbow Factory PMV is probably the only one I cared for
<ShadowQuill> Vordox: One of my favorite pony songs though
<Shooeie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8er83h9Bbn8&feature=g-hist
<Buytoast> someone stream something to end the waves of links god damn
<Lunar_Brony> I stopped clicking links at Rainbow Factory
<Reikim> Copied stuff over into another layer, time to try lineart. One finger on Control, another on Z, let's do this.
<flutter_spin> Most PMVs are nicely done, but really not my taste
<Vordox> Lunar_Brony: Mine's mostly safe. :)
<PuddingCupz> Y RAINBOW FACTORY IS GOOD
<flutter_spin> I think the Smile Brony Project PMV is the only really nice one...
<Ponies47> PuddingCupz: I jsut call everypony brony. I don't care what gender they are. I jsut call them brony
<flutter_spin> Simply because of the hidden talent of that one girl
<CCCP> SONG OF STORMS IS BEST ZELDA SONG
<Jspang1> how about some 4 chords? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDrrjbFikKo
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf6__NZ3Hgg&list=PLB8193CFD93A5F29C&index=77&feature=plpp_video
<Lunar_Brony> PuddingCupz because it reminds me of the fic far too much . . .
<Ponies47> *just
<PuddingCupz> Oh
<ShadowQuill> Rainbow Factory was a GREAT song!
<Vordox> DIAAAMOOOND DOOOOOOOOOOOOGS! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rl_gxFSOuY&feature=channel&list=UL
<ShadowQuill> Especially the violin parts
<flutter_spin> oh yeah. Rainbow Factory song is awesome. I love Tysolins take on it

<Reikim> Not sure how that works?
<ShadowQuill> Nittany_Discord: ALL OF MY YES
<ShadowQuill> I have Minecraft
<Ponies47> ShadowQuill: It was a mistake. I must learn to pay attiention :(
<kirz|art> gives you cleaner lines for the images

<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas&feature=g-vrec
<Reikim> *heavy Shift finger*
<kirz|art> basically vector vs bitmap is the difference in g4 vs g1
<ShadowQuill> Nice texture pack
<Shizuka> 13not on a server no
<pony_3745> MLP_Brovakiin: what part are you from?
<Shizuka> 13will be waiting for many plugins before that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CCCP: No video links during stream.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And there is a stream.
<kirz|art> cg look vs hand drawn look
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bedfordshire
<ShadowQuill> W00T MINECRAFT STREAM

<MLP_Brovakiin> sorry I am new to this and do not know how to directly respond
<Spectrum_Rush> Minecraft on stream
<CCCP> MLP_Brovakiin: tab

<Shooeie> So long has the buffer show been on?
<Dken2021> MLP_Brovakiin it's cool, also , welcome
<MLP_Brovakiin> ahh thanks
<ShadowQuill> Shooeie: A long, long time...
<cachi01> Ponies47: all i can see is music links
<Commander_Pigmask> I still get a bu-nvm
<otakon> there's a stream?
<cachi01> Ponies47: TELL ME :[

<ShadowQuill> Has anyone played the 8BIT MLP game?
<Dken2021> otakon nope, just the sound of thwe ind
<otakon> suddenly Crafting mines
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CCCP: refresh.
<Spectrum_Rush> so really no ones refreshed yet?
<kirz|art> yeah, vectors are easier to work with than bitmap, just because you can change things a lot easier, but it can be just as time consuming
<Commander_Pigmask> What kinna machinery is this
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We switched to Lime V.
<Ponies47> cachi01: It was a music link
<cachi01> Ponies47: the rainbow blood one?
<otakon> the hell are you doing Nittany_Discord?
*Spectrum_Rush i swear no one ever listens to me
<Ponies47> cachi01: Yeah. Now ShadowQuill hates me :<
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT has pizza now
<ShadowQuill> Anyone played 8bit MLP game, thoguh?
<cachi01> all i saw is interrobang pie music
<kirz|art> did you know, that if you say Shizu 3 times, she appears and wubs a Vivi in front of you, but you cannot share in the wub
<cachi01> BUT INTERROBANG PI IS AWESOME
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord k
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: Listen to the lyrics
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: me its fun :)
<Dken2021> ShadowQuill story of the blanks?
<ShadowQuill> Dken2021: No.

<Reikim> This myth
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: Wut?
<Shizuka> 13quit making me switch
<Reikim> We must test it scientifically!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not streaming.

<kirz|art> lol
<Spectrum_Rush> its Shizuka
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> so... whats going on?
<Jim> otakon, Shizu is streaming
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: did you know its the same creator of twilight vs stairs?
<otakon> oh Shizu is?
<ShadowQuill> Dken2021: Just search 8bit MLP and type the password HUBMLP8BIT
<Commander_Pigmask> What did Shizuka do?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirz|art where is vivi and the wubs ? i don't see them
<Reikim> So a shizu appeared, but there was no Vivi, thus the myth is busted.
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: REALLY?!
<pony_3745> is there any brony MC servers?
<otakon> Shizuka: I thought Comcast hated you streaming?
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: vs walking i mean
<Shooeie> Minecraft on xbox?
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: YEP
<otakon> pony_3745: I believe Wrek has one
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: I love that game! It is pony QWOP!

<PuddingCupz> k
<otakon> PuddingCupz: playing Minecraft
<Jim> I like the music, it makes it jungle-ish
<lowfn> Whos streaming
<Commander_Pigmask> On multiplayer

<Jim> Commander_Pigmask, It's with the new update

<Jim> is it from a game?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Except that question was too easy to get answered.
<ShadowQuill> cachi01: :[ IT'S NOT FUNNY!
<pony_3745> would be good if we could all get on a server
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirz|art considering LimeV hates me and does not display due to me having a IP from mexico :p

<stalkaminer> shizulka: then why are you replaying?
<Pudge> dat shizu, bein silly filly
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm sure mitamaking doesn't even know what's a furry
<MLP_Brovakiin> ahh bals to it, I cannot sleep. I guess i will watch the sun rise and pretend celestia has something to do with it...
<Commander_Pigmask> Shizuka, you troll you
<mitamaking> A furry is: having or coated in fur
<stalkaminer> burnt
<CrimsonPhoenix> exactly
<Commander_Pigmask> WHOOSH.
<CrimsonPhoenix> He doesn't know what's a furry
<stalkaminer> shizuka: can you join my lan server?
<mitamaking> CommunistBrony: Also it is a misspelling of fury
<Commander_Pigmask> Wat's LAN
<CommunistBrony> ok
<sub06905> LAN server :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> local area network
<Pudge> Commander_Pigmask: local area network, as in not on the internet
<mitamaking> Line Area Network I think
<kirz|art> pandora finally hit on Blue :3
<mitamaking> Oh, local not line
<Reikim> What is this pandora?
<CommunistBrony> its local
<Commander_Pigmask> mitamaking: The proper way to say it is FURRY. FACKING GET IT RIGHT
<Jim> Local Area Network
<kirz|art> streaming radio
<stalkaminer> the ip is any one from amarica?
<Pudge> only people on shizu's LAN can join her server
<sub06905> you have to be on the same internet connection for a LAN server
<mitamaking> Commander_Pigmask: You have some real fury there
<Reikim> Ah
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, you're cute
<kirz|art> has an algorithm that pulls songs from their library based on interests, what you put as likes/dislikes, genre, etc
<Commander_Pigmask> mitamaking: That makes no fucking sense.
<stalkaminer> :L
<Vordox> Conan O'Brien trying to "Game" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYY1GHzauCo&feature=g-u-u

<kirz|art> I don't think it's available outside the US any more though >.<
<Reikim> I am literally less than a day's drive away from the US
<twilight_sprinkle> ^say no!
<Vordox> Weird, I'm not sseeing anything
<mitamaking> Commander_Pigmask: Use some context to get the joke, I said furry is a mispelling of Fury, you got mad at me, so I said you were showing fury
<Reikim> A. Day.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is not :p
<Jim> Vordox, It's LimeV
<Jim> Refresh
<stalkaminer> .......
<Pudge> example: i have two computers and a laptop, and they are all connected via my LAN, so they can communicat with each other
<Vordox> Oh, no wonder, I'm still on Mips
<stalkaminer> I CAN PRANK MY BRO
<twilight_sprinkle> LimeV doesnt work in some countries
<Kandarihu> http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/7572/natg01.png <- This is my first shot. Look and laugh. At least I put some attention towards a mane-style
<stalkaminer> join his server i got a idea
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, you still don't know what a furry is.
<stalkaminer> for shiz
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: lol, have you ever seen my OC?
<kirz|art> one day I started on a Japanese song from Ghost in the Shell, 4 hours later it played a song from the Beach Boys
<sub06905> what you building there Shizuka?
<Reikim> I'm Canada, so hopefully it'll come here quick...but until then, bah.
<Phase4> 00,02i was pinged
<Pudge> dont worry about furries, they arent worth your time
<Reikim> Truly, the Internet has not been kind to me this day.
<CriticKitten> Oh look, Shizucraft. :o

<stalkaminer> shizuki: join my bros server i have a idea
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well you will get google fiber quicker
<Kandarihu> My unnamed OC
<stalkaminer> ill give you ip
<mitamaking> CrimsonPhoenix: I am an anime fan, don't go there
<Commander_Pigmask> mitamaking: All I'm sying is it makes NO FACKING SENSE. and the proper way is still furry, and also....that's implying furries are ALL grammar pignazis.
<Phase4> 00,02ah, lunar brony pinged me bout 2 hours ago
<Spectrum_Rush> Shamroc: Ecco the dolphin?
<Commander_Pigmask> Chattitiy derp
<Ponies47> Hi Phase4
<mitamaking> Commander_Pigmask: Did you just admit to being a furry?
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, and what pray-tell does that make it any different?
<Shamroc> Spectrum_Rush...no..never
<Pudge> ooh I loved echo the dolphin
<Kandarihu> I should also make self-ponification to make sure that people don't project that OC's personality onto me.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: Ecco the Dolphin?
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Ponies47
<Commander_Pigmask> mitamaking: people in pig suit's aren't furries. and no I didn't because I'm not.
<Buytoast> i've got it Shizuka : Deep Dungeon
<Spectrum_Rush> Shamroc: ment to ping shixu
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: heres my OC http://bit.ly/NafxcA
<Shamroc> Spectrum_Rush: i know
<CriticKitten> Pretty.
<Commander_Pigmask> Winderes errer?
<Reikim> ...fiber?
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: still better drawings than mine
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kandarihu, http://i.imgur.com/fhB7t.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: :D
<CommunistBrony> ohh i furry is someone who likes depicted animals with human characteristics and emotions
<Pudge> Shizuka: Sounds like Riven.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> https://fiber.google.com/about/
<kirz|art> Google Bran, new cereal they're releasing in Canada
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bingo
<Reikim> ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> CommunistBrony, got it
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's simple as that
<kirz|art> ^_^
<Pudge> :O
<mitamaking> Fine, a furry is someone who likes to wear a fur suit, the internet being what it is allows them to get together, including the part that like to have sex in said suits like the animals they portray
<Reikim> I'd put more ellipses, but there are not enough elipses in the world to convey the sheer wat of that concept.
<CommunistBrony> i am derpy pony tonight :D
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, lol. I was shown a collection of art guidelines. http://mlp-atg-alumni.deviantart.com/gallery/31073417
<Pudge> commies
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, that's not the definition of a furry
<Pudge> FEGELEIN FEGELEIN FEGELEIN
<CriticKitten> Can you eat all of those?
<CrimsonPhoenix> not at all
<Commander_Pigmask> mitamaking: ..... A furry is a human mixed with animal characteristics. GET IT RIGHT.
<stalkaminer> shizuka: join my bros server heres ip 68.8.146.104
<Phase4> 00,02oooo, minecraft
<Commander_Pigmask> Or an animal mixed with human characteristics
<Reikim> Oh
<Reikim> hahaha
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, the more disturbing aspects of the Furry fandom, the fewer members of the community are actually into that.
*Reikim laughs
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: thx i will keep that pic
<mitamaking> Commander_Pigmask, CommunistBrony: Not true, a furry may just like wearing the suit
<CommunistBrony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: ah that one, yeah ive seen it earlier today. i kinda planned out all of that myself, but my pic is just a result of frustration of failing with vectotr drawing
<Spectrum_Rush> oh hey the minecraft bit from Shizuka s openimg
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's like saying a Brony is one that must disguise himself as a pony and cyber in the net
*sub06905 still cant figure out where the music if from
<Jim> I love how I've absolutely destroyed my sleeping patern lately. Going to bed at 7 am and waking up at 3 pm, that's normal
<Reikim> You got me...should've opened that link first.
<Pudge> CrimsonPhoenix: no they are different
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: I understand that, but just by being a furry, you are not half that animal
<Reikim> Sadly, though, I wouldn't put it past Google.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, and you're using MS Paint
<stalkaminer> shizuka: are you playing lan?
<CommunistBrony> Jim: same expect 9am to 5pm
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pudge it's similar
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: the program i was gonna use turned out to be uninstalled, and i never figured out how to vector in photoshop. so i opened paint and drew whatever :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> furry community is extremely large
<Commander_Pigmask> mitamaking: Furry MEANS AN ANIMAL WITH HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS OR A HUMAN WITH ANIMAL CHARACTERISTICS. The others are called furry cosplayers, damnit.
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, most furries don't even wear the suits.
<stalkaminer> ok
<Buytoast> good god, you people are still discussing furries
<Pudge> CrimsonPhoenix: furries actually dress up as animals, i havent seen a brony dress up in an applejack suit, only cosplay
<CrimsonPhoenix> some are on the porn while others detest it
<mitamaking> Commander_Pigmask: calm down?
<stalkaminer> well you should do somthin with a mod
<Commander_Pigmask> Pudge no they don't
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cosplay is the same thing
<Vordox> Is t Wrek playin?
<stalkaminer> the flans mod
*Phase4 00,02hugs VioletVanilla
<CrimsonPhoenix> and not ALL furries has fursuit
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: but you yourself said we are furries, ofc we liek to discuss it
<Jim> Vordox, Shiz
<Buytoast> fair enough
<Vordox> Dayum, that's alot of work. :P
<Buytoast> still
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: That I will admit I didn't know, I thought the suit was the requirement
<Pudge> Bronys/=/furries
<Commander_Pigmask> Bronies aren't furries.
<Buytoast> never seen so much yiff discusion in here
<CrimsonPhoenix> if you deny my claim I demand you prove it
<Reikim> Gigabyte a second
<Vordox> In Build mode or collected gamewise, Shizuka ?
<mitamaking> Some bronies are furries
<CommunistBrony> i shouldnt of asked about furry's just cased a long debate lol :)
<Reikim> I'm just interested in whether or not they can pull that off.
<CommunistBrony> caused*
<Vordox> Ah
<Commander_Pigmask> Pudge: No, bronies aren't furries. What your saying is talking ponies= humans with fur.
<Pudge> look what you did CommunistBrony, you've opened the floodgates
<sub06905> all this furry talk
<twilight_sprinkle> CommunistBrony: you can always just google
<mitamaking> CommunistBrony: Why are you mad at me about it anyway?
<stalkaminer> go to nerdcubed's channel seach for minecraft flans mod
<Vordox> No "Buy some apples" Shiz. That's alot to dig. :P
<Reikim> Well it's interesting
<CommunistBrony> mitamaking: im not?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Could I get some feedback please? https://twitter.com/dailymail123/status/231244275646623745/photo/1
<Jim> Wow, that looks like it must have taken some time
<Pudge> Commander_Pigmask: no thats not what i said
<Commander_Pigmask> STOP. let'S CHANGE THE SUBJECT to this land.
<mitamaking> Have some furry http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pOrbs-IbdBg/T5CY_NM15nI/AAAAAAAAAOw/95-RT8wvCQQ/s1600/c5068baaa0b41504768056123bb2db10fcdf37f6-740.jpg
<Vordox> Use time change, Shizuka
<CrimsonPhoenix> Commander_Pigmask, not all bronies are furries but some furries are bronies
<Reikim> And I wonder why they're trying in Canada first...well, whatever.
*Reikim yawns
<Jim> not bad MLP_Brovakiin
<Vordox> Oh Chunks XD
*Reikim Dear Princess Celestia
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, a love of anthropomorphized animal characters is pretty much the definition of furry. It's the most basic definition of furries, and most furries only take their fandom that far.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: castle master?
*Reikim Today I learned several things.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thanks :3
<Vordox> I love how chat via 2 chats. :
<Vordox> :D
<Kandarihu> Fans of Looney Tunes qualify as furries.
<Commander_Pigmask> CrimsonPhoenix: The bronies that are furries are furries AND bronies. That's a small amount of the community.
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: I thought the definition extended farther, I back off my previous claim
<stalkaminer> shizuka: is the minecraft bugging out?
<Pudge> Kandarihu: some are
*Reikim First, human beings are fundamentally untrustworthy, don't beleive them for a second, and make sure you give them a nice hefty legal document saying they're responsible for their actions.
<Ponies47> brb
<CrimsonPhoenix> Commander_Pigmask, it's more than you think
<CrimsonPhoenix> trust me
<CrimsonPhoenix> most celebrities are actually furry
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, it's a common misconception. Perhaps we have 4chan to thank for that, maybe not.
<Vordox> Are you not able to update your old maps to the new ones without fear, Shizuka ?
<stalkaminer> shizuka: well it is say /debug tust me
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: By that definition though, all bronies are furries
*Reikim Second, every team has a control freak, and when said freak is at the head of the project, well, you're screwed.
*Reikim Third, I learned how to draw ponies better! Yay!
<mitamaking> moo
<CommunistBrony> i now feel like an otter that has just plucked the tinyist swig in the damm, collapses and destroyed furtile farm land :D
<Pudge> nooo
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, MLP aren't anthro
<Jim> Even if you give them a hefty legal document, they might not be thrustworthy still
*Reikim Your faithful student, Reikim
<Pudge> the ONLY anthro character on MLP is spike
<Reikim> Night everyone.
<mitamaking> CrimsonPhoenix: Lyra is
<Spectrum_Rush> guess i'm still wrong on the ost Shizuka ?
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, I was about to say that as well, but aside from My Little Pony Tales, CrimsonPhoenix is right. MLP isn't anthro
<kirz|art> g'night Reikim
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Reikim
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wow, I have never actually watched the sun rise before :)
<Vordox> XD
<CriticKitten> Shizu has a marshmallow flank? I....I did not know this. o.o
<cratorkid> k guys im back after lightnigh took out my power for 3 hours
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, you're putting fanon in argument
*Spectrum_Rush tdkdfydjcykg
<CrimsonPhoenix> thus it is invaliud
<Pudge> cratorkid: at least you got rain
<RainBowJack> hmmmm Marshmellow flanks
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Lyra isn't anthro
<Reikim> Well, two hours later, I'm STILL steamed about that leak...maybe it'll help if I sleep on it. Night everypony.
<Jim> night re-
<mitamaking> Well isn't the fanon realevent in this discussion
<Jim> hmm
<Commander_Pigmask> JUST SHUT UP AND WATCH THE VIDEO DAMNIT
<CrimsonPhoenix> She's just.......Hummus
<CommunistBrony> night Reikim
<stalkaminer> shizuka: hack/mine mod?
<Buytoast> boy i'm glad i'm keeping quiet for this round of arguing
<Jim> night Reikim
<Pudge> who thought lyra was anthro? what because of the whole human thing? that's not canon
*Commander_Pigmask eats Buytoast
<CrimsonPhoenix> or Fleshy
<Sabershy> Hello everypony! How are you guys doing?
<Commander_Pigmask> Nawm.
<Pudge> hai Sabershy
<Buytoast> so much ban worthy material i'm thinkin about
<Jim> hi Sabershy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i may not hear the end of this but, kirz|art will you add a marshmellowy flank to shizu drawing ?
<Pudge> Buytoast: refrain yourself
<Buytoast> oh i am
<Buytoast> still
<kirz|art> hehe :3
<Jim> hah
<stalkaminer> unsuprisly gasp*
<mitamaking> Pudge: I know, it was half a joke, but doesn't the fact that the fandom except that come into factor in arguing if bronies are furries
<mitamaking> *accepts
<Jim> oo, awesome map
<twilight_sprinkle> eqd and 4chan are exploding all over the place cause of the leak
*Commander_Pigmask throws rocks at Mitamaking and Pudge for continuing the damn argument
<mitamaking> leak?
<CrimsonPhoenix> lol twilight_sprinkle
<Buytoast> everybody is gettin mad
<Buytoast> the rage is delicious
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....(I download it)
<Pudge> mitamaking: i dont know, i really dont want to argue about this because I dont want to be in the same boat as furries
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: they broke the woolz!
<mitamaking> I don't get why people are mad
<Commander_Pigmask> Buytoast: I'
<kirz|art> I'll only say this, Shizuka is a healthy young mare that owns and operates her own bakery
<mitamaking> What leak?
<Commander_Pigmask> Buytoast: I'm just here to throw rocks and eat you.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: Veil of Darkness?
<CommunistBrony> any i can not wait for season 3 :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: could you repeat that? i missed it
<Jim> Bakin' bread
<mitamaking> OH MY GOSH FiM leaked!!!!

<stalkaminer> omg...
<superretroworld> thats a nice place
*Commander_Pigmask comforts Spectrum_Rush with a Luxury Bannana
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i dont see how its a spoiler unless i link, but ok, not a big deal
<Jim> Buytoast, O U
<Buytoast> it was still a game
<Jim> it didn't have music
<stalkaminer> HES TRAVILING THROUGH TIME!!!!!!!!!
<mitamaking> Seems they are overracting though
<PuddingCupz> sry lowfn cant make a server it annoys me AND my comp/internet lags!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinkle, i meen dont spoil it :P
<Commander_Pigmask> FIM WAS LEAKED?
<Buytoast> oh boy
*Pudge shakes head
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: Unshadowed?
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: wait are you talking about FiM or freindship is fighting?
<robokun> Shizuka: there a map file of your server laying around somewhere?
<twilight_sprinkle> *fighting is magic
<mitamaking> Fighting
<Vordox> About the FiM Leak: Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend
<CrimsonPhoenix> well Phase4 we're not talking about the content
<Jim> pretty
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....yet
<Pudge> FOREVERRRR
<mitamaking> Wow, can't believe a QA person leaked it
<Commander_Pigmask> Vordox: FOREVERRRRRRR
<Vordox> I am not touching the FiM Leak due to that this is NOT what the people who made it, wanted it to be
<sub06905> play mario party with a friend is another way to lose a friend
<Vordox> I'm doing this as a respectful act for those who spents years and months on this game.
<Vordox> Would you?
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, im not saying anyth about the content, hell i dont even know it, i havent played
<mitamaking> I mean I wish they treated it like a surprise demo, oh well
<superretroworld> sub06905: and battletoads
<twilight_sprinkle> but i can b quiet, not a big deal, just dont quite understand how its a spoiler
<Jim> Oh man, Battletoads is so insanely hard
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, I let the curiosity get the better of me but I would still support the last build and I won't distribute the leak that I have
<CrimsonPhoenix> is it bad?
<Commander_Pigmask> Change subject to pigs and pigmasks
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: No, it's not bad.
<CrimsonPhoenix> then good
<Commander_Pigmask> PIGS.
<Vordox> I'm just stating my stand on this, I WANT to play it, but it's NOT out yet.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: yeah im not touching it for the same reasons
<Jim> We've been told to drop the subject several times guys
<mitamaking> I mean, why stop the Bite Size Updates?
<PuddingCupz> lowfn:Making a steam acc
<Commander_Pigmask> Guys. DROP IT
<Vordox> Just like the Clean version of CMC Theme, or the cut of the Soundfiles etc etc from FiM, anything that's done by anyone should be respected.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: even though logically at this point i cant be too angry at people who play it
<Vordox> Or we won't ever get nice things.
<Shizuka> 13Enough.
<Shizuka> 13Drop the subject about the leak.
<Commander_Pigmask> Exactly.

<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/JGCsyshUU-A
<RAWRity> oh hai
<Canadian_Brony> hi RAWRity
<RAWRity> I'm in time for a Wreky stream it would seem.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi RaveBrony
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> woops
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> RAWRity
<Canadian_Brony> dat tab fail
<RaveBrony> Oh, i was wondering where the music came from :O (got like +20 tabs open). Hi there, Wrek! :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<RAWRity> Which, considering the time difference...jesus Wrek, do you ever sleep?
<Canadian_Brony> ohia RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> Hey Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2, how did you know i came back to this tab? O_o
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity sleep is for the weak!
<CrimsonPhoenix> oooh
<RaveBrony> Hey Canadian_Brony :P
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: they tried to tab me
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can't post some lindsey anymore
<CrimsonPhoenix> :<
<Canadian_Brony> is that good?
<CriticKitten> mfw people keep saying that LoL has "dethroned" WoW as the top MMO: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/829/ :|
<RaveBrony> RAWRity: Oh, alright :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, lol what
<Canadian_Brony> wait, LoL is a MMO?
<CrimsonPhoenix> LoL isn't even an MMO
<CriticKitten> No.
<Canadian_Brony> what is LoL?
<CriticKitten> It's not. That's my point.
<CrimsonPhoenix> LoL is MOBA
<RAWRity> meh, Lindsey Stirling's okay, but a music stream I frequent plays her so often, and the people there sing her praises so devotedly, I can't help but feel like she's overrated.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Multiplayer Oline Battle Arena
<Canadian_Brony> . . . that is?
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> .
<CrimsonPhoenix> RAWRity, oh....
<CriticKitten> Escapist keeps saying that LoL has "dethroned" WoW. Which it hasn't, because THEY ARE DIFFERENT GENRES OF GAMES. >_>
<CrimsonPhoenix> sorry about that
<Canadian_Brony> ohai CriticKitten
<CriticKitten> Hai.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: LoL is also nowhere near as well known outside of gaming circles.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Carefull with that RAWRity
<Canadian_Brony> certainly doesn't sound like a MMO, and I don't play them
<CrimsonPhoenix> LoL is free
<Wrek|Observiking> 05not much of a stream
<CriticKitten> It's a real-time strategy game.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but it'll do untill i gotta dash
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Wrek|Observiking: a Stream is a Stream
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek|Observiking it's something
<Sabershy> Better then nothing though, Wrek.
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's no strategy in controlling one single caharacter
<Canadian_Brony> *insert Robin Hood: Men in Tights quote*
<Basenji> I never cared for LoL personally
<Soul> im baack
<CrimsonPhoenix> character**
<Canadian_Brony> WB Soul
<CriticKitten> It's literally nothing like WoW, but these terrible fricking writers keep saying it's beaten WoW. It makes me want to say "you know what? Farmville probably beat WoW before LoL got there, why don't you report that?"
<Basenji> Much perfer SC2
<Sabershy> Cool, my Soul is back. :)
<Canadian_Brony> LoLz
<Soul> ty ^^
<CriticKitten> Crimson: It's an offshoot of the RTS genre. :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, I can understand your rage but I can't feel it
<CrimsonPhoenix> CriticKitten, I know about DotA don't worry
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know the origin and all but I still can't see LoL as an RTS at all
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like saying Diablo is an RTS
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> O_O
<CriticKitten> Argue with Wikipedia, not me. :p
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, Wikipedia
<CrimsonPhoenix> also escapist is a joke for gaming journalism
<CriticKitten> I really dun give a crap how MOBAs are organized.
<RAWRity> Clearly they should make a SoTC MMO.
<RustyMeat> hay guys what are we watching?
<Sabershy> Random music videos.
<RAWRity> So it's just everybody riding around a barren wasteland, not talking to eachther, fighting monsters for a vaguely defined purpose.
<CrimsonPhoenix> they actually called it Action RTS?
<CrimsonPhoenix> BS
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hate being wrong
<RAWRity> speaking of, apparently teh guy who directed "Chronicle" is on board to direct the Shadow of the Colossus movie
<CrimsonPhoenix> though I was half right
<Soul> im so excited for legends of equestria :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Soul, you mean that 3d MMO?
<Soul> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> whatever happened to tht anyway?
<RAWRity> did anybody here play the leaked Fighting is Magic?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I did
<Soul> no
<CrimsonPhoenix> mostly to figure out Rawrity
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: you're bad and you should feel bad.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but we should put a halt on the subject here
<CrimsonPhoenix> RAWRity, I won't distribute it anyway
<Soul> but im curious, how did you control the characters
<Wrek|Observiking> 05no i got standards
<prince-dari> Just to make sure you guys know, we don't condone downloading or playing the leaked FiM game, so no discussion of gameplay or links surrounding it please.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05rather wait for a release
<Soul> oh, sorry
<prince-dari> That's fine
<CrimsonPhoenix> I did attempt to end it there
<RustyMeat> I LIEK PONIEZ
<RustyMeat> :3
<prince-dari> If you guys want to talk about it you can still do so over PM
<prince-dari> Or in another channel
<Soul> RustyMeat: really? SO DO I! :O
<RustyMeat> Fluttershy is best poney
<Canadian_Brony> works for me
<Soul> pinkie pie is my fave :3
<Basenji> I actualy stumbled upon this webpage >.> feel out of place XD
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you guys like ponies? eeew gaaaay
<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow Dash is the definition of awesome.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05heh welcome Basenji
<Sabershy> What is this Fighting is Magic?
<RustyMeat> nope

<Sabershy> What? My ponies fighting each other? Sounds interesting. Gonna go check it out...
<Basenji> Hi hi Wrek and Darkts3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> LoE seems interesting
<Soul> It looks cool to me, I'd love to make my OC and play it
<RAWRity> I am looking forward to the fanwank when that MLP dating sim comes out.

<[Alpha]> I keep changeing my name but I'll keep this version
<[Alpha]> So who's streaming?
<Canadian_Brony> nopony
*SuperBrony64 hugs Wrek|Observiking
<Canadian_Brony> I spat all over my screen when I say a "Cupcakes" t-shirt
<[Alpha]> Then the music is spontanaious?
<Barbetos|Quakecon> Random hugs
<Canadian_Brony> oh! Oops, sorry. I'm not watchign stream
<Canadian_Brony> brb. Gotta clean my monitar and desk
<Canadian_Brony> covered in root beer now

<Canadian_Brony> http://www.redbubble.com/people/choccywitch/works/8344260-trust-derpy-shes-science?body_color=white&p=t-shirt&print_location=front&size=medium&style=mens
<[Alpha]> Screw the cooment I would still get the shirt
<[Alpha]> comment
<pony_5521> hey
<Canadian_Brony> hi
<Sabershy> The commenter has a valid reason though.
<Sabershy> If you gunna pay 30 something for a shirt, make sure it is good quality.
<[Alpha]> I'm still wondering hiw the stream is taking place if Wrek is at a meeting and that is Wrek's OC right there
<Sabershy> Proly left his computer on and streaming, my guess till someone else decids to take over.
<[Alpha]> Very True I know but the image is so fun
*[Alpha] Is still in awe because Sim Gretina was on Bronystate earlier today
<Canadian_Brony> I would get this for my sister, but their smallest is too large for her http://www.redbubble.com/people/strangetalk/works/8535289-sweetie-belle-best-little-sister-ever?body_color=white&p=t-shirt&print_location=front&size=medium&style=mens
<[Alpha]> Well if it isn't preshrunk then it can be expected to shrink
*Jmo4267 slaps Sabershy
<Sabershy> ?
<Sabershy> :'(
<Jmo4267> :3
*Sabershy begins to sniffle
*Jmo4267 hugs and hands muffins to Sabershy
<Canadian_Brony> does cotton shrink?
<[Alpha]> :D
<Canadian_Brony> my shirt is 100% cotton, but I know nothing about that kind of stuff
<[Alpha]> If not properly cared for and washed it can be shrunk. That is why I always buy one size bigger than I actaully am :P
<Canadian_Brony> k
<[Alpha]> -washed properly
<[Alpha]> hmm
<[Alpha]> food
<Canadian_Brony> all I have is ductape
<Canadian_Brony> I left the muffins with Luna on the moon
<Canadian_Brony> otherwise I would throw one at you
<[Alpha]> Make a magical flying ducttape carpet and ride it to the moon
<Canadian_Brony> I'm an earth pony
<Canadian_Brony> and I do science
<[Alpha]> hmmmm use science
<Canadian_Brony> well, I did make a ductape-making-machine out of ductape . . .
<Canadian_Brony> don't ask
<[Alpha]> Awesome
<[Alpha]> I'm slightly tempted to keave to test out the update on Artstudio
<[Alpha]> -leave
<Sabershy> Up to you. You can always come back.
<[Alpha]> true but when I draw I spend hours on one drawing even if it does suck
<Basenji> Well time for sleep just fell asleep in my chair... See you all later maybe

<Sabershy> Other than that it is up to the streamers whether they feel like ponies
<Sabershy> Just, please don't ask for them.
<Basenji> I will rarely talk in chat usualy so i won't ask :P
<[Alpha]> Switching over to safari. I'll lose the stream but I'll chat and draw at the same time
<Sabershy> Yea. If they stream ponies to much; who knows? We might get tired of them.
<JESmith71> Yeah Basenji if you ask for ponies as a cruel gag they'll put on G3
<[Alpha]> I don't I've seen Season 1 and 2 4 times already

<[Alpha]> If I was going to build something in minecraft I think I would plan it out and draw a sketch of what it would look like the fromthere modify it as I see fit
<MadSurge> derpy_pony: :D modern times allow you to have no sense of direction
<derpy_pony> haha
<[Alpha]> Sense of direction is overrated

<Wrek> 05it it doesnt fuck up again
<Flyboy> sounds roman
<Chrysalis> anyone know a decent webhost?
<Chrysalis> this one i got off saturn doesnt fit my needs
<Wrek> 05maybe Phase4 knows of one
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 know any decent webhosts?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, depends on what you need
<Chrysalis> ftp access, and reliable email servers
<Flyboy> any of you guys got guild 2?
<Jmo4267> Caser.
<Jmo4267> Caeser&
<Jmo4267> Caeser* Fml
<Chrysalis> i left my old cause they lost emails from jobs i applied to
<Chrysalis> and the one saturn recommended, Gandi, only has sftp, and for somethings i do i need ftp
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, you can use gandi as just a dns host and have an external webhost
<Chrysalis> i have a domain already, i pointed to them as a host
<prince-dari> Sad times when you remember old MMOs you used to play that have since died.
<Phase4> 00,02free ones like 000webhost are fine for not hosting anything important
<Chrysalis> its my portfolio
<Chrysalis> and i use the php/ftp/mysql for program interop
<Jmo4267> Want a tissue prince-dari?
<Phase4> 00,02000webhost will work for that, but not expect much for nothing
<prince-dari> Nah
<Phase4> 00,02dont'
<prince-dari> I got over it a while ago
<Jmo4267> Suure you did.
<Chrysalis> i do pay for my host
<[Alpha]> That is how I took a picture of derpy inside the snowglobe in episode 44 a friend in deed
<prince-dari> But I remember them every so often
<Chrysalis> hell i payed for about 6 years on my last one
<Flyboy> prince-dari: ever played runescape?
<prince-dari> Yeah
<Jmo4267> lolrunescape
<Chrysalis> oh wow, runescape
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, nfshost is good, service is great and you get ssh access
<Chrysalis> not played that in a LONG time
*Phase4 00,02used to play runescape
<Flyboy> prince-dari: it used to be good, then they basically cocked up
<prince-dari> Lawl, I got my mum into runescape.
<prince-dari> Then I stopped playing
<Phase4> 00,02runescape is crap now, completly different game
<Wrek> 05ok the game doesnt even have options
<Wrek> 05lets see if i can force it intow indowed
<Flyboy> i stopped playing when my mum found out i had membership which was eating away at her money :D
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> I remember my early F2P days on Runescape.
<Wrek> 05same
<prince-dari> When some guy gave me 14k out of the blue, and I was just "OMFGJAODFIGJKDFOIJGSDFIOJAERGIO"
<Wrek> 05first time i played it was... 04?
<Hrafn> a friend got me to try Runescape once, long ago, and I pretty much instantly got bored of it :P
<Jmo4267> Here's an idea, let's all play Runescape Classic and re-live the moments where we wanted to tear our faces off.
<[Alpha]> I had completed all the nonmem quests and I was lvl 55 then I forgot my password and the email I used's password as well
<Hrafn> I just can't get into MMOs
<prince-dari> You can't play RS classic unless you already have an account. >:
<prince-dari> Sad times
<Jmo4267> I has RS Classic account, umad?
<Jmo4267> <3
<prince-dari> I was talking about Rubies of Eventide in this particular case though. :P
<Chrysalis> some emails... http://screensnapr.com/v/kJAQRp.png
<[Alpha]> I mad all my money mining ores and selling them as well as some blacksmithing
<[Alpha]> -made
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Hrafn> mmm... babies
<Chrysalis> there 80% off
<[Alpha]> Don't get me started on babies I'm the oldest
<Hrafn> sounds like a good deal

<Serenity> Phase4: Probably your end. For once, I'm flawless
<Flyboy> i better not be the only one who knows what the senate is :|
<BronyDarth> Strategy is my cup of tea, puzzles... Is my pears, I hate pears.
<Malavolent> Flyboy: You mean there are people who don't know what it is?
<Serenity> I love puzzle
<Flyboy> Malavolent: apparently
<MadSurge> Flyboy: my country still has the senate :D
<SirGanjalf> Dken2021: Yep, but not the one like Warcraft or sth similar
<Chrysalis> im not gettin any bufferin here
<Malavolent> Flyboy: Well, damn.

<Flyboy> Jmo4267: :(
<BronyDarth> Rome wasnt built in a day though
<Dken2021> yea, spelling isn't your forte
*Jmo4267 hugs Flyboy
<BronyDarth> It was built in 5 minutes.
<Serenity> Flyboy: And you complained about my spelling. Mine was intentional
<Flyboy> Jmo4267: are you mocking me! :'(
<SirGanjalf> There was a 3d Ceaser if i remember
<Jmo4267> NOPE.
<SirGanjalf> *Caesar
<Flyboy> Serenity: actually i was complaining about my own spelling
<Serenity> Why does it matter about graphics anyway
<Flyboy> Serenity: :D
<BronyDarth> I know how to say Caesar without the swastika now! CÆSAR III
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Ever played one of the similiar games to this called pharaoh?
<SirGanjalf> "Our prefecture is out paTROLLING"
<Jmo4267> lol Pharaoh
<Jmo4267> That
<Jmo4267> game
<Dken2021> now I feel like finishing Actraiser, but those action stages :s
<Serenity> How the HELL do I get a cold in the summer
<SirGanjalf> dat aqueduct
<BronyDarth> Serenity: Norway
<BronyDarth> Thats whyu
<[Alpha]> cold....I'm gonna get some icecream or a popsicle
<Serenity> Confound them norgies! D:
<BronyDarth> NO.
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6474183168
<Serenity> Why not give the infection to Sweden?
<Flyboy> Serenity: discord. no more needed
<BronyDarth> John De lacie sounds french somehow.
<BronyDarth> CONFOUND THE FRENCHMEN!
<killerpony7733> Dem gods
<Flyboy> guys, im going to ask you some questions to test your survival skill.
<[Alpha]> you know if you order an American burger in france they'll give it to you with pineapples
<BronyDarth> Is that a PP ref?
<Chrysalis> mmm pineapples
<Malavolent> What do gods do when they're enraged?
<killerpony7733> They kill their people for the lulz
<Dken2021> [Alpha] yum
<Flyboy> you wash up on an island and you need water. where do you get it from?
<Serenity> Flyboy: Bear Grylls
<BronyDarth> Flyboy: Piss
<[Alpha]> mmm fried pineapples
<Malavolent> Flyboy: I wait for rain.
<killerpony7733> Oh god wrek they gods don't like you :(
<Serenity> The true answer: My pocket
<BronyDarth> Malavolent: If you're deserted in the wests it wont rain.
<killerpony7733> the*
<Flyboy> Malavolent: thats a good idea! but it isnt going to rain for a long time
<Flyboy> Malavolent: so what now
<Malavolent> Flyboy: Wait for snow?
<Flyboy> AND NO DRINKING PISS
<Waffles> wtf?
<BronyDarth> It doesnt snow it the wests.
<Serenity> As long as you take it in small amounts at a time, you can handle sea water
<BronyDarth> UNLESS ITS DISCORD
*[Alpha] is drinking piss,"oops"
<Flyboy> Malavolent: it wont snjow. EVER
<Flyboy> snow*
<BronyDarth> Flyboy: Discord.
<Flyboy> BronyDarth: quiet you
<Malavolent> Then I would probably search for fresh water.
*Serenity is drinking a tasty drink from pouch
<Flyboy> Malavolent: hey hey! thats good!, you find a freshwater river and drink up.
<Malavolent> Did I win?
<BronyDarth> This is what to do Flyboy, Minecraft, cut down the trees, crafting table and make a boat.
<Jmo4267> You will never win.
<BronyDarth> SAVED
<Flyboy> i was waiting for someone to say, "hur hur! drink from the sea HUR HUR"
<Serenity> Flyboy: You can survive it if you drink in small amounts
<Flyboy> Malavolent: now you need shelter, there are no caves around though
<Serenity> Which can get you going for a bit
<Flyboy> Serenity: if you dont filter it, you will still get sick.
<Flyboy> Serenity: however little you drink
<Malavolent> Flyboy: How about sleeping in tree top?
<BronyDarth> SO THAT MEANS IM SICK WHEN I DRINK WATER FROM THE SEA?!
<Serenity> ^ sick bastard
<BronyDarth> I would be dead now wouldnt I?
<Serenity> :3
<BronyDarth> OBJECTION!!! Flyboy is lying!
<Chrysalis> finally dawnguard is on PC
<Chrysalis> £14?
<Flyboy> Malavolent: good idea, now you need food for the night, how do you get it? there are multiple ways for this one
<Chrysalis> damn a DLC that costs more than alot of games
<Serenity> Flyboy: This one is quite easy, you can search for any ripe fruit from trees
<Serenity> Or, if there's no fruit, you can get a sharp rock and attack any edible animal
<Flyboy> Serenity: ok, thats one way, how about the others?
<Malavolent> What Serenity said.
<Flyboy> ok, what about fishing?
<Serenity> Then make a fire, cook it and nomming time
<Serenity> Flyboy: That will take HOURS
<Serenity> Espeically with no bait
<Flyboy> Serenity: not exactly, not with a spear
<[Alpha]> you will need to gut the fish
<BronyDarth> Serenity: A sharp rock to kill something? Damn, who teaches you how to survive? A weakling?
<Chrysalis> huh
<Chrysalis> the new tf2 heavy weapon
<Chrysalis> has pyro like abilities
<Flyboy> Serenity: you get a long stick, sharpen one end, and use it to kill fish
<Serenity> BronyDarth: I don't survive, I destroy.
<BronyDarth> I dont destroy, I make chaos.
<Serenity> Besides, why am I answering thee questions? No matter what happens, I'll always have a gun with me
<Malavolent> I don't chaos, I pony.
<Flyboy> i dont make chaos, i AM chaos
<[Alpha]> I am choas
<BronyDarth> I am not chaos, Im discord.
<[Alpha]> too late got beat out XD
<Serenity> Just shoot the animal in the face = ded
<BronyDarth> Serenity: They wont die if you hit their mouth though
<Flyboy> ok guys, so youve survived for the night, but you need to get off the island, how will you do it?
<BronyDarth> MAKE A BOAT
<Malavolent> Serenity: You might want to save some ammo if you're on deserted island.
<Flyboy> BronyDarth: not as easy as it sonds
<Flyboy> sounds
<BronyDarth> BOAT
<BronyDarth> BOAT BOAT BOAT BOAT
<Serenity> Malavolent: I always carry more than 10 clips with me
<BronyDarth> *banned*
<Malavolent> Serenity: I hope we will never meet in person then.
<Serenity> Don't worry. I'm not in war with you now, am I?
<Flyboy> okay then BronyDarth, you make a boat, it sinks, youre now dead. happy birthday
<Malavolent> Winrar.
<BronyDarth> No.
<BronyDarth> I can swim
<[Alpha]> I can't :P
<BronyDarth> Theres an island 6 metres away, willl you swim there?
<Serenity> If it was 6 meters away, you wouldn't need to swim
<BronyDarth> ACTUALLY IM A PEGASI, WHY AM I ANSWERING THIS? I CAN FLY!
<Serenity> The water wouldn't be deep enough
<BronyDarth> It can
<Serenity> You can also cut the caps
<BronyDarth> What caps?
<BronyDarth> Its shift.
<Flyboy> BronyDarth: I'M MAKINH THE RULES HERE MORTAL! your wings just vanished, a shark eats you. ded D-E-D ded
<MadSurge> :) a thriving city
<[Alpha]> :S
<Serenity> Shifting a basic letter will create the same effect as caps lock, don't play cleverdick
<[Alpha]> CleverBot
<Flyboy> okay anyway! Malavolent and Serenity, you must find a way off this island, how will you go about it
<Serenity> Flyboy: I might try and find some debris anywhere, mabye what I crashed from and try and built a small boat
<Malavolent> Look for fallen trees and make a raft out of the,.
<Flyboy> Serenity and Malavolent making a boat isnt as easy as it sounds guys, you need a watertight material or something that can store air tightly, do you have any of those?
<MadSurge> So is the winning condition of all these games "conquer the world"?
<Serenity> Flyboy: Trees.
<BronyDarth> Flyboy, you say that you challenged everyone right?
<BronyDarth> Then why cant we make bridges out of ourselves?
<Flyboy> BronyDarth: you died remember. eaten by a shark
<Flyboy> BronyDarth: your each on a different island
<BronyDarth> Alrighty then.
<BronyDarth> I'm eaten by a shark.
<BronyDarth> What do I do?
<Malavolent> Die.
<BronyDarth> Fishslap it to death.
<Serenity> Continue to be dead?
*[Alpha] is staying out this
<BronyDarth> NO.
<BronyDarth> I only want to make a boat.
<Serenity> Work at a boat factory then
<Flyboy> well if it was me, i would make a big bonfire out of wet wood. it would create lots of smoke and i would use it as a signal fire.
<Flyboy> simples!
<BronyDarth> 6 Messages in 10 seconds?
<Malavolent> Flyboy: What would you use to start a fire?
<BronyDarth> 400,000 messages in 12 seconds ok?
<Serenity> Malavolent: Haven't you heard of that old friction trick?
<Flyboy> Malavolent: two sticks, like a drill
<Malavolent> That is exhausting and most of the time it doesn't work.
<Flyboy> Malavolent: i would drill one into the other. the friction would create heat, the heat would create fire, voila
<BronyDarth> Ok, Im now dead, Im an angel pegasi, I have two pair of wings, what Im gonna do? Im gonna get a new life as a fly. And annoy the manure out of Malavolent *trollface*
<Malavolent> Yay, food.
<derpy_pony> flyboy...for the material...tar
<Flyboy> Malavolent: either that or use two rocks to make sparks
*BronyDarth thinks he shall pass the trolling
<derpy_pony> can be cooked from resins
<Wrek> 05so far so good
<Malavolent> Flyboy: If you know what rock do you need, then maybe.
<Serenity> Slagrock mostly
<Wrek> 05still worked fine?
*BronyDarth flies to the island with Serenity on it
<Flyboy> derpy_pony: good idea! you get off the island, to the next one where you meet Malavolent but your boat is falling apart so it cant be used again
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Yep
<Serenity> The most rough, ergo, generating tonnes of friction
*Serenity shoots down BronyDarth
<BronyDarth> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
<derpy_pony> bones make good glue
<Malavolent> Can I eat derpy_pony ?
<derpy_pony> too late
<Serenity> derpy_pony: From the bone meal?
<derpy_pony> I used your bones for construction already
<derpy_pony> think so
<Flyboy> Malavolent: no, he can help you, so you should accept his help
*BronyDarth gets a new life as a rotten banana and falls on Malavolent
<[Alpha]> ....:S
<Flyboy> derpy_pony: same to you, dont kill eachother
<Malavolent> BronyDarth: Now you're just being silly.
<derpy_pony> cooperation is for casuals. I want to have all the coconut trees for myself :P
<[Alpha]> minecraft refernce?
<derpy_pony> ok...malevolent can do some tasks for me
<derpy_pony> a
<Serenity> Well, I got a crate of food and drink, I think I can set off for whereever this raft will take me :3
<Malavolent> derpy_pony: This is my island, I make the rules here
<derpy_pony> this means war!
<Flyboy> Serenity: you set of and manage to barely get to another uninhabited island, or so you think... DUN DUN DUUUN
<derpy_pony> the rules will be changed
<MegaMoonShine> Hi dudes :)
<derpy_pony> hi MegaMoonShine :)
<Serenity> Flyboy: Ooh, a crashed ROFLcopter

<[Alpha]> Screw the rules I have money

<Jmo4267> MegaMoonShine: Caeser 3
*derpy_pony sells Malavolent to [Alpha]
<MegaMoonShine> Interesting
<Serenity> Anyway, I'm done because I've just realised what I've been doing the past 10 minutes
<Flyboy> Serenity: as you explore, you find a native man, he doesnt speak your language but takes you to someone who does, a man named flyboy!
<derpy_pony> ok...plan b...cooperation. any useful skills?
<Malavolent> derpy_pony: Well... I can cook minute rice in 59 seconds.
<Flyboy> Serenity: Flyboy tells you that you can get a boat off of the ilsnad if you want, but you can stay here aswell. it is up to you
<derpy_pony> you are the royal cookery advisor then
<[Alpha]> -looks at Dery_Pony ," What am I going to do with this?"
<Malavolent> I'm okay with this.
<derpy_pony> get it to build a boat, [Alpha]. I pay well
<Malavolent> Lol, fire.
<derpy_pony> also, minute rice

<derpy_pony> they fit into the houses somehow
<Phase4> 00,02my internet died again aparently
<derpy_pony> wb Phase4

<TheRandomkid321> Phase4That sucks mate.
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, it does but its my fault for lazyness
<Chrysalis> Phase4 still lookin
<JRP2234[JRP]> SuperBrony64|Zzz: ur not sleeping LIER
<Spyglass> who here watches Game Grumps?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, do you have numbers? how much bandwidth/disk space and so on
<Phase4> 00,02that you need that is
<Chrysalis> only a few gig of each, its the reliability i need the most
<derpy_pony> gtg, have fun everypony! :)
<JRP2234[JRP]> phase4
<Chrysalis> im tempted to get a VPS
<Jmo4267> See ya derpy_pony
<JRP2234[JRP]> Phase4: start up a teamspeak server
<TheRandomkid321> Phase4. I hate to ask you this as if it apears I am bothering you but could you suggest a PC thst can run TF2 at max graphics? I am only using that as an example.
<Spyglass> derpy_pony: Welcome to Bronystate, I love you.
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234[JRP], not yet
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: Any old laptop can run TF2 on MEDIUM
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: And so all you need is a decent 500$ pc
<Serenity> Spyglass: That's a lie. El Shitbox can't run TF2 on low
<Serenity> And it's a tower
<Phase4> 00,02TheRandomkid321, i've got a gt540m, it runs at high
<Spyglass> Serenity: El what?
<Chrysalis> the biggest constraint is AA
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Serenity> El shitbox.
<Chrysalis> turn that down and the requirements drop like a stone
<Phase4> 00,02i turn my down because of that
<Flyboy> Phase4: when you do start up a teamspeak server, tell me please
<Spyglass> Serenity: Xbox 360?
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, will do
<JRP2234[JRP]> skype party
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/pricing
<Serenity> Spyglass: No, desktop
<TheRandomkid321> I kind of want a laptop though. COuld anyone suggest a laptop that has the ability to run TF2 at max graphics?
<Spyglass> Serenity: I think I underpstand
<Serenity> 512 Mb ram, ati radeon 2400 gpu and pentium dual core 1.8 gh/z.
<[Alpha]> Asus
<Chrysalis> yeah i was looking at them
<Flyboy> Phase4: oh also, if you know any good games i could get, please tell. its my BDay soon so ima need a list
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: Get an alienware MX11
<Serenity> It ish crapola
<Spyglass> *M11x*
<Phase4> 00,02you can get ftp but sshfs is recomended
<TheRandomkid321> Spyglass You're joking... YOU ARE JOKING!?
<Serenity> alienware is kinda crap
<Jmo4267> Lol Spyglass
<Spyglass> The M11X alienware laptop is only about 700$
<Jmo4267> You're a fool.
<Spyglass> No
<Chrysalis> 0.01 per megabyte per month
<Phase4> 00,02i forget the exact names, you can use winscp for it
<Spyglass> The M11X is a cheap good gaming laptop
<Serenity> If you want a good computer, build a falcon
<Jmo4267> To even suggest Alienware.
<TheRandomkid321> Alienware. yeah. That doesnt suck a$$
<Spyglass> Show me another good gaming laptop that costs under 1,000$
<Spyglass> I dare you
<Spyglass> Do it right now
<Chrysalis> my current site backup nears 2 gig
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, pricing is strange, and yeah depends on how much you need to store
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Serenity> Spyglass: One second, good sir
<Spyglass> Serenity: This'll be good.
<TheRandomkid321> Spyglass it costs 1500 in australia.
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: Austrailia sucks
<TheRandomkid321> Spyglass Bite your tongue!
<Jmo4267> Austrailia?
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, you seen the new heavy weapon?
<Phase4> 00,02Australia is best
<[Alpha]> Hey respect people
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: Lol
<Jmo4267> Australia represent Phase4
<Chrysalis> paired with an engineer that thing is massivly OP
<BronyDarth> Anyone wanting to go to paintchat? :3
<[Alpha]> :) why do I love derpy so much
<TheRandomkid321> I'll ask my computer repair guy about a good PC taht can handle games well. I'm sick of chosing between HORRID graphics or missing out on a round while the level loads.
<Spyglass> [Alpha]: she follows you
<Serenity> Grr, can't find it
<AdamTheDuck> OMG NOSTALGIA BONER RIGHT NOW
<Spyglass> Serenity: cHECKmate Atheist
<AdamTheDuck> Wait....
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck... Heres a pillow... Use it wisely.
<AdamTheDuck> Is this AoE?
<[Alpha]> Really ? Freaking sweet
<BronyDarth> No.
<AdamTheDuck> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<BronyDarth> Its CÆSAR III
<Spyglass> Serenity: I did some research myself and found an asus for 800$
<[Alpha]> just upgrade your computer it'll be cheaper that way
<Spyglass> Serenity: But the specs are around to what the M11X is capable of doing
<TheRandomkid321> asus! My mother has taht computer... i ahet the keypad so much!
<AdamTheDuck> Looked like Age of Empires at first glance xD
<Spyglass> Alienware is a horrible brand for PC gaming. But when it comes to gaming laptops, they aren't bad.
<Jmo4267> Wait, how much did you say the M11X is?
<Flyboy> Phase4: dont you have loads of deadly creatures over in australia? i mean here in england we have lawyers but australia is worse apparently
<TheRandomkid321> 1500
<Spyglass> It was like 700$ last time I checked.
<Jmo4267> From whom?
<Jmo4267> I really would like to see this.
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, well redbacks live around here (not deadly but you dont want to get bit), whitetails are rare but not unheard of
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Dat feeling of still not being asleep...
<Spyglass> This laptop is the biggest waste of Money I've ever seen http://www.razerzone.com/blade
<Jmo4267> lol Razer Blade.
<Jmo4267> What a joke.
<Spyglass> yeh
<TheRandomkid321> FLyboy I hate stereo types liek this. We dont just see giant poisonous spiders daily. Whenever I reveal Im an aussie on XBL people ask if I ahve ever seen a giant spider the size of a plate.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02The only reason it's a waste of money right now is that it's using old tech.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02For what it has, it's pretty cool, the LCD screen as a trackpad really adds to the appeal :)
<Jmo4267> Even in itss time it was still expensive.
<Jmo4267> its*
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: I looked at a list of the ten most deadliest creatures in the entire world, and seven of them were in austrailia...
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321: but it's fun tellingwe go to school riding kangaroos...
<Spyglass> How are them Box Jellyfish?
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck True. I once told a kid taht my roof has like 40 giant spiders in it.
<Spyglass> *shivers*
<MegaMoonShine> Wow...
<JRP2234[JRP]> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<TheRandomkid321> Spyglass yes but we dont see them daily. I am not denying their existence though.
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: Most of that is garbage though
<BronyDarth> So australia have the most deadly creatures? Sniper kills everyone he meets. So its not 7 deadly its 8 deadly.
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: The stereotypes
<JRP2234[JRP]> MrPoniator: how bout you moooooooo
<BronyDarth> Soon its 1 deadly.
<Spyglass> I know all about stereotypes. I'm asian and everyone expects me to be super good at math and junk....
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02The Blade looks to me like the original MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display. It's ultra thin, yet packs a ton of power.
<Serenity> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Only not as shit?
<Serenity> Macs? Ugh,
<TheRandomkid321> I'll just ask my somputer fellow about a good computer.
<Spyglass> SuperBrony64|Zzz: A mac won't give you viruses. But atleast with a pc, you'll still be able to afford a doctor.
<Jmo4267> I can see where this is going. -runs-
<MegaMoonShine> Ugh... Macs :|
<TheRandomkid321> Serenity Bite your tongue... Okay mayby you do have a point... Stupid peice of.
<[Alpha]> :D
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Spyglass: Tru dat.
<TheRandomkid321> Spyglass THATS UNORIGINAL!
<Serenity> Macs can get viruses
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: Heh
<[Alpha]> Yup
<Spyglass> TheRandomkid321: It's funny though
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Serenity: It's a JOKE.
<BronyDarth> Macs is bad? Without them we wouldnt have PC. And without Android we wouldnt have Iphone, and we wouldnt have android without PC.
<Spyglass> Serenity: LOL, yeah but look at most of the viruses out there, they're designed for PC.
<Serenity> SuperBrony64|Zzz: (Kinda hard to tell sarcasm and all that through text)
<Spyglass> Serenity: Macs can get viruses, but most of them are PC designated
<shana> uhm please distinguish between PC and windows
<Spyglass> I'm pretty sure
<Spyglass> everyone correlates pc with WINDOWS
<shana> in genereal, please don't confuse hardware with software
<Spyglass> I've never heard anyone call a mac a PC.
<Serenity> shana: PC is something that computes, Windows is an OS
<BronyDarth> Lets end this Windows Mac PC thingie,
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Without Android we wouldn't have iPhone? lol wut, iPhone came out before Android
<BronyDarth> WITH boat!
<Serenity> Macs were made specifically for IOS
<BronyDarth> Super.
<BronyDarth> I mean the new Iphones.
<BronyDarth> Iphones uses android parts.
<[Alpha]> Without the microchip we wouldn't have any of this
<shana> Serenity: mac osx, not ios
<TheRandomkid321> It would be cool if a mod got a ROM of Xcom UFO defence and played it on the stream and chose names for the soldiers from the chat. I got the idea from a live stream and I am proud to say I am one of the four survivors of OPERATION: OWNAGE. A mission that ended in a "Tactical Fallback"
<BronyDarth> Without Earth we wouldnt have anything.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02And Androids use iPhone parts ;)
<Spyglass> shana: I know the differences and all. This conversation was directed towards those who know the differences already. And so it would be redundant to explain. Also pretentious...
<Serenity> Without ponies, we wouldn't have this chatroom
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Apple uses the available technology and tweaks it to better suit their hardware.
<BronyDarth> WITHOUT A CHATROOM, we would be bored as hell
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02^
<[Alpha]> and samsung use to make the iphone parts
<Spyglass> Without Lauren Faust, none of us would be talking to each other
<JRP2234[JRP]> SuperBrony64|Zzz: lets have a big skype party
<BronyDarth> Which line is longest, DAFUQ IS WRONG WITH THESE ADVERTISMENTS?!'
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Samsung phones really...kind of...suck >>
<Serenity> ^
<[Alpha]> Not the samsung galxy s 3
<Spyglass> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Have you ever owned an Iphone?
<Jmo4267> WoT.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02I'm especially talking about the Galaxy S 3 :)
<TheRandomkid321> I have an old samsung galaxy phone... I SWEAR ONE DAY I SHALL SMASH IT!
<shana> Spyglass: it's not redundant to use terms that are more appropriate. Example instead of saying that PC has more viruses it makes a lot more sense to say that x86 windows has more malware
<[Alpha]> Fine you are titled to your own opinio
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Spyglass: I've owned every iPhone (except the 3GS) since about a month after the first iPhone launched.
<BronyDarth> Bøat
<[Alpha]> Iphone is so bornig
<Serenity> What's the difference between x86 and any other type of windows? it runs 32 and 64
<Spyglass> shana: Well overall, the Windows os in general is more susceptible to viruses
<BronyDarth> They say im so bored, I want to see moar shaows.
<Wrek> 05this city is going to hell
<shana> Serenity: there's also windows for arm
<Wrek> 05xD
<MegaMoonShine> Oh god
<MegaMoonShine> Uhh... what happened?
<[Alpha]> I want the htc one x
<TheRandomkid321> Wrek you made new york YOU MONSTER!
<Wrek> 05im in dept to caesar!
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02No matter how appealing the hardware that I find on Android phones, iOS mixed with the iPhone hardware wins me everytime :)
<Wrek> 05oh noes!
<Spyglass> Has anyone stopped eating at Chik-fil-a?
<Wrek> 05fuckign gods demandign satisfaction makign me bankrupt
<BronyDarth> Dey sai im su b0red, i wan do sea moar shaos.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02But if there was one Android phone that I would buy instead of the iPhone, it would be the HTC One X.
<shana> Serenity: windows 8 has a arm version, windows ce had an arm version iirc and maybe other platforms
<[Alpha]> Ha I love htc
<BronyDarth> WRek, dey sai dey are s0 b0red!
<Spyglass> shana: I remember you
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02HTC is the only other manufacturer of smartphones besides Apple that I would buy.
<Serenity> ^
<BronyDarth> I never went to school, but I know the alphabeth
<Spyglass> shana: You're that techie girl. Who was here talking about tech last time.
<BronyDarth> This is it:
<[Alpha]> HTC sense for the win
<BronyDarth> QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02One of the biggest draw factors is they don't use the junk AMOLED displays and use real, super awesome and clear LCD displays :D
<[Alpha]> Yeah and they get better and better at making their phones
<shana> yeah I should stop nitpicking :)
<Flyboy> "so achmed, how do you spell your name?" "well its A-C-...Flem."
<Spyglass> Nah it's cool
<Spyglass> The internet is low on intelligent people, and so it's refreshing.
<BronyDarth> There is an extended alphabeth too!
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02I can't wait for the iPhone 5 to be announced, the leaked images of the case design look amazing. Glad I skipped the 4S for it :3
<Spyglass> To talk with someone who knows stuff.
<[Alpha]> I used to have the HTC desire then I went fishing
<Jmo4267> YOU'RE ALL MUFFINS.
<BronyDarth> 123456780+\qwertyuiopå
<BronyDarth> ¨ASDFHJKLØÆ'
<Spyglass> Jmo4267: Muffins are just cupcakes who never got asked to the prom :(
<BronyDarth> ¨ASDFHJKLØÆ'

<BronyDarth> Im being a BOAT

<Serenity> Wrek: *Talking in mafia voice* he will break yer legs, wise guy
<shana> thanks, now I can't eat chicken nuggets anymore..
<Jmo4267> LOL
<Flyboy> Wrek: i bet on celestia's right hoof that he will
<MegaMoonShine> I bet 150 bits Wrek

<TheRandomkid321> shana The scootaloo think ame me like chocken more.
<Flyboy> Serenity: he'll be sleepin' wid the fishes

<TheRandomkid321> Saturn I know that feeling, late at night, past your bedtime, scared to wake anyine. Well that was my situation anyway you I assume are a grown human.
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i'm pretty much bedbound now, and im feeling rather weak. not sure how long it'll take me to recover, but i should be back in a few days, and at least i'll be about sparodically, unless i end up having to go to hospital

<MegaMoonShine> Later dudes :)

<Saturn> 08,01BronyDarth: well, no; it's low humidity air
<Serenity> Saturn: You're screwed. Get somewhere humid
<Serenity> Much much better for breathing
<Jmo4267> That's always comforting^
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, if there's a moral to this story it's this: don't take illness lightly, and go to the doctor as soon as you can when something is wrong

<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: Does starting an old save or new game work?
<Serenity> Well, at least you don't have to live a life with el Shitbox

<Dken2021> ancient city of Grome
<teentro> :O
<teentro> or is it reek??? :P
<StinkomanFan> Dken2012, THIS ISN'T ROME, THIS IS MY ORIGINAL COUNTRY: BROME
<JRP2234[JRP]> MakerDusk
<Thorn> Where the ponys lived.
<Jmo4267> ponys
<teentro> ponys :D
<Kandarihu> Well, since Wrek is building this, I think a more proper name of this should be Wrome.
<StinkomanFan> PONIES
<Dken2021> where they drink and be merry?
<Thorn> And the bronians lived.
<Jmo4267> You people make me cry.
<Thorn> Our ancestors.
<teentro> now you get a hug of me :P
<Jmo4267> Muffins.
<teentro> *HUGÜ
<Kandarihu> Wrek, sorry. That was stupid of me.
<teentro> Ü=*
<StinkomanFan> They worshipped the Moon God Celestia and the Night God Luna
<StinkomanFan> Also the love god Cadance
<Thorn> Oh yeah, muffins were invented by a baker in Brome
<Dken2021> what about the other gods?
<StinkomanFan> FUCK THE OTHER GODS
<Thorn> Just though it would be interesting.
<Thorn> So was mail.
<Thorn> And bubbles.
<teentro> okey... it gettin kindda weired here :3
<JRP2234[JRP]> asdfghjkl;'
<Kandarihu> And they took great pride in their love and tolerance, but it was all hubris.
<Dken2021> teentro it tends to sometimes
<JRP2234[JRP]> y u make me sad4
<Phase4> 00,02even riven is crashing now
<JRP2234[JRP]> sad*
<Phase4> 00,02nothing likes my pc
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: Nuuuuuuuu, not Riven!
<shana> Phase4: what kind of crash?
<Kandarihu> Phase4, why don't you want to restart?
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, because it happens anyway
<StinkomanFan> But then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked
<Thorn> And the mail was transported by Derpy's ancestor, Derpilan
<shana> but think of the uptime Kandarihu!
<Phase4> 00,02^
<JRP2234[JRP]> y u make me sad
<Phase4> 00,02uptime is of greatest importants
<teentro> we need more music in here :3
<Jmo4267> Sounds like you're having a fun night Phase4
<StinkomanFan> Thorn, and Dinkian? Her daughter?
<Thorn> And the bronians and ponys lived together in harmony, until the haters came and sepperated.
<teentro> this morning was a great band playing :D
<Thorn> Oh yeah, forgot about that.\
<shana> Phase4: how randomly does it crash? might be ram..
<Phase4> 00,02shana, rams fine
<StinkomanFan> DINKIAN THE GREAT... what's Dinky remembered for again?
<Thorn> When dinkian grew up, she became a baker.
<Kandarihu> Uptime is just a number. You're pretty much rendering your computer useless for the sake of a pretty number.
<teentro> that... much... english...
<Phase4> 00,02shana, i've got 16GB and i start things with random ammounts of other stuff running
<teentro> need... german... stuff :S
<Thorn> And made the best muffins in Brome, bringing new flavours such as Chocolate Chip
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, its only windows that has the 'you need to restart' problem
<Thorn> And blueberry
<teentro> blueberry??? oO
<teentro> sounds delicous :D
<WindWhistler> I never knew bronies could be nerds...until I came to Bronystate.
<AdamTheDuck> WindWhistler: Welcome to the internet, I will be your guide.
<WindWhistler> Actually that isn't true. I was just trying to be funny.
<Dken2021> nerds rule the earth anyway
<StinkomanFan> Seriously WindWhistler? A brony is one of the famous nerd cliques
<Kandarihu> So you're certain that nothing of use can come from restarting?
<WindWhistler> AdamTheDuck: You better not try to tell me there aren't any girls on the internet. Or I'll cut you.
<Thorn> And every day, Dinkian always backed a basket of Muffins for Derpian
<AdamTheDuck> :S
<WindWhistler> StinkomanFan: I just said I wasn't serious.
<Thorn> And Dinkian's cutie mark?
<Phase4> 00,02http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/ what if robot apocalypse
<Thorn> You guessed it, a muffin.
<teentro> well... i need something german... so ill play mc...
<WindWhistler> Ugh, that movie was awful Phase4
<teentro> on a german server :O
<Phase4> 00,02WindWhistler, what movie?
<WindWhistler> Oh wait, that's Robot Hallocaust
<Dken2021> and Lyracles, a philosipher of bipedial sentiants
<shana> just looked up nerd in the oxford dictionary "a foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or is boringly studious" -- so negative :(
<Kandarihu> Phase4, I saw that. Glad Randal is bringing attention to EMPs, but even HE is presenting it in a positive light.
<teentro> seeeeee ya tonight...
<teentro> or maybe sooner :P
<Dken2021> seeya then teen... bah
<Thorn> Anyway, the Bronians and Ponys lived together in harmony, the Bronians providing buildings and tools, and the ponys provinding food and resorces and magic
<StinkomanFan> What are Lyra's and Bon-Bon's ancestor's called?
<StinkomanFan> *were
<Serenity> StinkomanFan: Humans
<Serenity> :3
<StinkomanFan> :o
<WindWhistler> HUMANS? IN EQUESTRIA?
<Thorn> This is brome windwhistler.
<Thorn> The bronians are humans and were on earth.
<WindWhistler> Oh. Of course.
<WindWhistler> Silly me.
<WindWhistler> Facehoof.
<Thorn> The ponys are yet to move to equestria.
<JRP2234[JRP]> :(
<Jmo4267> inb4 fanfiction is made out of this.
<WindWhistler> WHAT'S WRONG JRP2234[JRP]
<JRP2234[JRP]> y u make me sad
<makoton> Howdy, everypony.
<WindWhistler> I DIDN'T MAKE YOU SAD
<StinkomanFan> Thorn's just making a backstory for Wrek's kingdom.
<WindWhistler> YOU MADE YOURSELF SAD
<Thorn> ^__^
<AdamTheDuck> Hello makoton
<WindWhistler> STOP BEING SO SAD
<JRP2234[JRP]> people reject my skype
<WindWhistler> JRP2234[JRP]: Don't use Skype with people you don't know.
<makoton> Is that Caesar 3 I'm seeing?
<WindWhistler> I was right. You ARE making yourself sad
<JRP2234[JRP]> lies
<Thorn> Anyway, the Romans, who built a city next to Rome, just couldnt understan the Bronians and there bonds with ponys.
<WindWhistler> TRUTHS
<WindWhistler> Shouldn't it be Bronans?
<JRP2234[JRP]> wheres my rope
<WindWhistler> Or Bromans?
<Thorn> Because they didn't understand, they hated it.
<WindWhistler> Oh, who's this BerryPunch mod?
<Thorn> So they started taking the ponys and using them as mules for there carts and chariots.
<StinkomanFan> I think BerryPunch is a bot.
<makoton> Oh, man Impressions Games knew how to make citybuilders back in the day
<WindWhistler> oh
<Serenity> Well, I just finished my new OC
<Vivix> makoton: what games did they make?
<WindWhistler> Anyways, I'm just about to watch Manos: Hands of Fate on MST3K
<WindWhistler> Anyone wanna join me?
<Thorn> The bronians, not used to fighting, couldn't do anything to stop it.
*JRP2234[JRP] grabs rope
*WindWhistler gives JRP2234[JRP] a rope snake
<StinkomanFan> A very soft bot with a taste for liquor
<makoton> Vivix: Pharaoh and its expansion Cleopatra, this game, Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdon
<Serenity> WindWhistler: Get off my rope snake D:
*JRP2234[JRP] ties rope
<Kandarihu> WindWhistler, where?
<makoton> kingdom*
<makoton> and several others
<AdamTheDuck> Serenity: Can we take a peek? :P
*JRP2234[JRP] jumps
<Vivix> Hn..I think I played Emperor
<WindWhistler> Kandarihu: club-mst3k
<Serenity> Not right now, Imgur is down
<Thorn> Celestia, however, was not pleased with the treatment of their people
<Kandarihu> Right after I asked, I realized I have other things to do.
<WindWhistler> Kandarihu: Pffft.
<Vivix> Emperor looks really cool-
<makoton> It does, don't it?
*WindWhistler adopts rope snake
<Serenity> Thought that said small caca
<Thorn> So, with the combined powers of Luna, Celestia and Candeza, they made a new land named Equestria.
<MadSurge> Why is there women coughing in the background
<WindWhistler> MadSurge: Because they're sick of this movie
<StinkomanFan> Mmmmmm BerryPunch you're so soft and bubbly~
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: :D
<MadSurge> BUILD ALL THE THINGS!
<Vivix> so what're the trilogy or movies today?
<makoton> Oh, man, this is a nostalgia trip.
<Vivix> oh wait it's friday, newsletter
<Thorn> With the remaning power, they summoned every pony to the center of bronian, and afterwards, the ponys were transported to Equestira, the bronians never to hear from them again.
<WindWhistler> Man. De Blob was such an awesome game, it inspired me to make a comic of it.
<MadSurge> Vivix: I remember there's the Scott Pilgrim movie
<Thorn> Until now.
<Vivix> it said despicable me and.. one more
<Vivix> hm
*JRP2234[JRP] TIES rope to roof
<Vivix> Twelve tasks of asterix
*WindWhistler kills JRP2234[JRP]
<Thorn> The end.
<StinkomanFan> Thorn, they became slaves to the Equestrians didn't they?
<Thorn> No.
<Thorn> They stayed on earth.
<Thorn> While the ponys went to equestria.
<Vivix> Equestrians in Equestria treating equines equally
<WindWhistler> Okay, back to work!
<Thorn> *facehoof*
<TheKoreanBrony1354> good morning everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' TheKoreanBrony1354

<TheKoreanBrony1354> pnkie and derpy made cupcakes and muffins for all of us
<JRP2234[JRP]> my luck jsut ran out
<JRP2234[JRP]> i might pull the plug
<Thorn> She continued to carry mail from Equesria to Bronian
<Thorn> And vise versa
<StinkomanFan> AND THE STORY OF DERPIAN IS A LONG AND LUXORIOUS ONE
<StinkomanFan> So we'll just hold on that one
<Thorn> So derpy became the messenger between the worlds.
<Thorn> And she still is.
<Thorn> With the help of the doctor, of corse.
<Thorn> The end
<Thorn> Now wasnt that an epic story?
<StinkomanFan> So if we find the fictional ruins of Brome we'll find Derpy?
<Thorn> Yes.

<HeavyWeaponsGuy> I guess we will find out.
<flyershy> they livwe
<Serenity> Still. Beats Twilight in every fucking perspective
<Invi> why can't anybody important die? :<
<HellsFortune> Invi: cuz happy ending
<RosePetal> Any Vampire story is better than Twilight.
<Serenity> Because assasisns
<Invi> Serenity what movie doesn't? :D
<HeavyWeaponsGuy> Sure is
<Sundaysmile> movie over?
<Serenity> Invi: Titanic Ii
<Serenity> Justin beibers documentary
<Invi> HellsFortune happy endings suck >.>
<RosePetal> It's his sister...
<HellsFortune> Invi: i know right ?

<HellsFortune> i want that hat
<Sundaysmile> Ebay
<HeavyWeaponsGuy> Free hat anyone?
<Serenity> I have my own
<RosePetal> Cup of blood.
<Serenity> I'm wearing a fedora
<JESmith71> Well RosePetal if any vampie story beats Twilight, then does The Cellar beat it to (The Cellar's this fanfic I read the other day that involves the CMC and vampires)
<RosePetal> Yes.
<RosePetal> The head of Voldemort!
<HellsFortune> LIES
<Dark_Horst> hui. what'S this?
<Serenity> 'dat line
<Sundaysmile> And then he faithed the shit out of the vampires
<alexxm> really it's just beggening
<Serenity> So clitche
<Nyst> So corny.
<Dark_Horst> what are we watching?
<HellsFortune> priest
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: A stream
<Sundaysmile> Wait... this is the ending?
<HellsFortune> yes
<RosePetal> What is with these crosses on thier foreheads?
<Eli> the end of priest to be exact
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: no shit
<RosePetal> The end?
<Sundaysmile> that was the crappiest ending ever
<Serenity> Damn, makes ME3's ending look good :3
<RosePetal> The end.
<Dark_Horst> series or movie?
<Sundaysmile> was like half a movie
<alexxm> it just ends
<RosePetal> Based on a book.
<Sundaysmile> ah
<Invi> Serenity http://derpy.me/q86WV :D
<Sundaysmile> that explains it then
<HellsFortune> the book is probably better :P
<Serenity> But then again, a lot of films have sudden endings
<HeavyWeaponsGuy> The fucks i could give about this ending in zero
<Sundaysmile> most books are better than the movies
<Eli> Sundaysmile: that's what you call 'ending just good enough to start another movie to make even more money'
<Sundaysmile> or a low budget tv series
<Serenity> I think the best sudden ending was Monty Pythons
<alexxm> it just ends just like that
<Midnight_Splendor> Movies tend to cut out many scenes that help with the plot from the bool.
<Serenity> They suddenly get arrested and that's it, the French win
<Midnight_Splendor> book*
<HeavyWeaponsGuy> so now what...
<HellsFortune> ^
<Serenity> Aliens. Must be

<Thrackerzod> and i just cant spell today
<Vordox> Thrackerzod: Speaking about FUN commercials...
<alexxm> i'd buy that for a dollar
<cratorkid> this is crazy
<Nyst> Besides the obvious cannibalism, there's also the thing where people pay for something that...cuts a hotdog.

<StinkomanFan> D:
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix no, only a gamerip, but the officuial OST of that game ( which has 1/4 of the music of the game...) is on iTunes

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03dunno if Rina heard this one!
<CriticKitten> So, serious question, why does Bieber get so much hate for creating material that's roughly as derivative as a lot of modern pop?
<Vordox> I have a teeth condition
<Vordox> If I brush too much I bleed
<Vordox> =P
*Nittany_Discord 11,01It's bacon time!

<sagas> MadSurge: what?
<Kandarihu> Ah, this is my request.
<Vordox> Well...
<RAWRity> Vordox: eeyup. They keep small knives for when they cut themselves, and take blood thinners beforehand in preparation.
