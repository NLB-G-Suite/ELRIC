<Kammerjunk> I'd choose neither.
<ekips> GW>WoW
<YourLittleDashie> LAST D'AWW PIC FOR A WHILE: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lla4vpWyE61qh979ko1_500.png
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> GW has the no monthly payment
<Pegasus> have you ever had a pizza, covered in chocolete and suger? 'cause I have
<Dark_Horst> dafuq whas the white shit?
<Kammerjunk> WoW is killing WoW and Blizzard knows it. Best to go with GW2.

<Jim> We don't know that yet
<DaringDude> PILLs
<YourLittleDashie> PEELZ
<Eulshy> the daww must be countered
<Kammerjunk> Well, Blizzard seems pretty hyped about making that new MMOFPS.
<CriticKitten> >better dungeons
<Jim> GW2 is supposed to be based a lot on PVP too though
<YourLittleDashie> NOOOOOOOOOOO
*Dashie_Dashie *cough*
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> ORRRRR, should i get Borderlands 2 or Guild Wars 2
<YourLittleDashie> Don't counter the D'aww
<Eulshy> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/137775
<LadyCanary> o_o
<ekips> oh look, i got a steam message..
<Pegasus> whoever is a younge derp say I
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> borderlands 2!
<BronyinJapan> lol
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Spectrum_Dash> brb
<CriticKitten> Cracked up at that since there's really not a lot of footage of GW2 dungeons, but what I *have* seen is pretty awesome. >_>
<unfoundbug> blow all the shit up
<Dark_Horst> blizzard MMOFPS? tell me more
<kenne88> lol asshats
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<ThatsAShinySky> Can anyone tell me tips on how to not screw up when talking to a girl?
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: It's an MMOFPS. It's called Titan.
<Jim> I would get both GW2 and Borderlands 2
<Kammerjunk> That's all we know.
<Dark_Horst> imma google dat
<Jim> Also, Torchlight 2
<Pegasus> HEY DOES ANYONE LISEN TO ME
<RawketLawnchair> Violet?
<Eulshy> no we don't listen
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Or, rather, it's a "next-generation MMO".
<PinkiemenaCopy> Wrek.. y u no accept
<Kammerjunk> But that basically means MMOFPS.
<Paradise92> Hi all :)
<YourLittleDashie> OMG Eulshy that's too much counterd'aww
<Dashie_Dashie> in other words, buy my shit, and I'll let you in.
<Jim> ohai Paradise92
<Dark_Horst> pfsh, blizzard and innovation, right
<Kammerjunk> I know, right.
<Kammerjunk> But they're not the only ones.
*Paradise92 tackles Jim
<Dashie_Dashie> Diablo 3 is best game.
<Pegasus> *flys away to neverland*
<Eulshy> then no more daww shall be posted
<Kammerjunk> CCP are making Dust 516 or whatever.
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> K: IDEA! MMO pokemon game where you control the pokemon itself, meaining you run, jump, and dodge all the attacks as the pokemon, having to aim your attacks at the other enemy. You run around as the trainer then battle as the pokemon with a non turn-by-turn system
<CriticKitten> Diablo 3, pft
<Paradise92> Blizzard is making an FFA game :)
<GabeMoist> This = best image ever: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59540229/GM.jpg
<Paradise92> not FFA
<Kammerjunk> Taze her!
<Paradise92> F2P
<Eulshy> you mean like pokepark?
<Paradise92> sry
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> I would play that all day
<Jim> GabeMoist: Exquisite
<Dark_Horst> so basically a pokemon FPS?
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> YES!
<GabeMoist> AllisZero drew it :3
<Paradise92> somepony streaming?
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Wrek is
<Dashie_Dashie> Wreks to busy to save you.
<Dark_Horst> you'll need moar boom
<Dashie_Dashie> he just shoots instead
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Send out bloodwing!
<Kammerjunk> GabeMoist: What the hay am I looking at?
<Dark_Horst> and this is why i upgraded mag size on that thing
<CriticKitten> Diablo 3 is a single player RPG that wants to be an MMO so badly that it dresses slutty like one, hangs out with a bad crowd like one, and demands exorbent amounts of your money like one.
<Pegasus> O.K i'm back and I got you a suvennire want it?
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Bloodwing!
<Jim> Bloodwing is best wing
<Spectrum_Dash> somepony send wrek an MLD quote
<Dark_Horst> boom
<Spectrum_Dash> it'll be funny
<PinkiePieCopy> Dashie_Dashie I sent you a steam fr
<Eulshy> finally my computer is starting to lag less
<Dark_Horst> use BOOMvolver for massive damage
<Pegasus> SCOOT SCOOTALOO?
<Kammerjunk> Wow, these guys have the most overdramatic deaths ever.
<Dark_Horst> or, well, that... thing
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Not bloodwing but that works
<YourLittleDashie> BRB
<Jim> Melee kills seem to be more effective than guns
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Why do they run liek they're straigh from GMod
<Dark_Horst> maybe the virus got programmed in gmod?
<Kammerjunk> Still alive~
<PinkiePieCopy> Anypony here who has steam add the player PinkiePieCopy
<Jim> This was a triumph
<otakon> SayWhat|FlutterWisp: they are being driven insane by their implants, and Wrek is NOT going to have enough ammo to finish this
<SayWhat|FlutterWisp> Oh jees
<Dashie_Dashie> Fists in Deus Ex work better than guns? BETTER DRINK MY OWN PISS.

<Eulshy> Yes but it's hard to get more.
<Cypresswolf> well, if those "friends" are willing to so easily throw away a friendship over difference of interests, maybe they arent very good friends to begin with
<LadyCanary> Oh I see TOY_PON3. But you know, hes the one being silly.
<Derpy_Hooves> johnjoseco opens commissions on moday /)^ 3^(\

<TOY_PON3> SilverStreak: You don't know who JJ is?
<The_4th_Wall> You have ponies; that's better than friends who shun you because ponie

<Phase4> dat dragon roost isle
<lemur> i love this music
<AttackWithHugs> CCCP: Because the majority of bronies are males and apparently it's bad if a male watches a show for girls, yet nobody complains a bit when a female watches football or some other male-dominated sport.
<TOY_PON3> Eventually
<kenne88> kay im back what i miss
<The_4th_Wall> If you DON'T watch MLP, that's just girly

<The_4th_Wall> I'm gonna buy all of them on day 1.

<Solargirl> WHY IS EVERYONE OVEREACTING ON THE DERPY THING!?
<flutter_spin> weren't you going to draw fluttershy with glasses and a hat?
<Cypresswolf> Monster trucks are for boys, while ballet is for girls. Ive known a few guys who like watching ballet and ice skating becuase the motions and dance is nice to watch
<Genericblue> haha
<LadyCanary> ....
<LadyCanary> Holy mother.
<kenne88> thegreatandpowerfult"<3
<CCCP> Has any one seen the MLP physics?
<LadyCanary> That's GORGEOUS.
<The_4th_Wall> BECAUSE DERPY WAS JUST FINE

<The_4th_Wall> it was good'
<Solargirl> But the change is nothing to freak out over
<TOY_PON3> ^
<AttackWithHugs> CCCP: Because it's society. And society is known for judging something different without even stopping to ask about it.
<SilverStreak> nice
<CCCP> That guy is one hardcore brony
<TOY_PON3> Damn overeacting bronies -.-
<AttackWithHugs> CCCP: Especially in America.

<flutter_spin> I want that pic
<AttackWithHugs> CCCP: You do have a valid point that I obviously missed. I'm referring to the ones that dislike bronies simply because they feel it's "wrong". Much like gay marriage: they say it "destroys the institution of marriage" but look at all these celebrities getting married and then divorcing like a month or week later, meanwhile everybody gets their panties in a wad when they see two men or women that truly love each other
<TOY_PON3> thanks fillyfillyy for reminding me that i used to be sad....

<SaxyPretender> 0,14and how I said it was the best part of Batman Forever
<Dashie_Dashie> mfw I have a resturant chain where I live called "Ruby Tuesday"

<Dashie_Dashie> BEST SUNDAES EVAR

<Phase4> um, i think 000host might be down
<flutter_spin> yeah, it stated that it was down and couldn't connect
<Shizuka> 13they aren't down, just slow
<TOY_PON3> so is the stream still dead?
<Dashie_Dashie> dead on my end
*LadyCanary yawns
<Phase4> 000host is down
<flutter_spin> well my router tends to die between 11 and 12, but I could connect elsewhere
<Shizuka> 13bed.. hmm...

<flutter_spin> Anyone else think my cat is perty?
<otakon> the refresh button is not working
<NewDCD> 09,01I spent like thirty hours on it, just for my reflexes to catch up with the note speed. Then, mastering 4Buttons. I've spent like 100 hours in the series, and I still can't tackle 5B or 6B. 4B still gives me trouble.
<jffry890> wrek sleeps?
<TOY_PON3> sleep..sounds even better
<NewDCD> 09,01It's...MERCILESS.
<otakon> um guys
<Polydunami> Anyway, why does Polydunami like thigh high socks? It's mind-boggling
<otakon> mfw Bronystate won't refresh
<TOY_PON3> oh god..

<TOY_PON3> I'm scared to close window
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek gets off stream so late that it's too late for me to stream anything.

<TOY_PON3> Nittany_Discord: Who was it? If I may ask
<NewDCD> 09,01so you guys can make fun of my absolute inability to keep up with the note charts
<flutter_spin> I'm still trying to find that pic of them in the theater
<The_4th_Wall> Really special? Who?
<otakon> yeah guys something is wrong here
<kenne88> is no one going to stream then
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was going to be with FimFlamFilosopher.
*TOY_PON3 frowns
<otakon> I tried opening Bronystate in another tab
<Shizuka> 13otakon: the nameservers for bronystate.net are slow
<otakon> argh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't own the games he wants to play.
<Shizuka> 13not within our control
<Phase4> Shizuka: nameservers are fine
<Phase4> or has the ip changed
<otakon> fantastic
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's why I was asking for DoW and Civ4.
<Shizuka> 13000web is not down
<flutter_spin> http://cshep99.deviantart.com/art/cmc3k-template-257920648 ^^
<TOY_PON3> so Bronystate is down or what?
<TOY_PON3> Oh nvm
<Shizuka> 13because i just checked it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I can get those games, we can make the event happen.
<otakon> it's not down, but the connection keeps resetting on me
<Phase4> flutter_spin: :3
<September> Can't tell if lag or no stream is on now.
<Polydunami> Dat MSP3K
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I can't buy them because I'm in a financial crisis.
<Phase4> brb, have to reload chat
<Polydunami> P=whaddayathink?
<Phase4> good thing the chat is on a different domain
<The_4th_Wall> ^
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> but I'm using the irc client
<otakon> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.bronystate.net
<Polydunami> I'm on the site itself
<otakon> also this
<Phase4> bronystate.net resolves to 31.170.160.83
<Dashie_Dashie> mother of god..
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9s-VkwSfNA
<LadyCanary> ...
<Polydunami> Oh god
<LadyCanary> Oh good lord Ive seen that.
<flutter_spin> I should have asked Wrek where to find that mlp pic
<Phase4> i sware vince is doing that deliberatly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol new scout cross over soon
<TOY_PON3> Shit I shouldn't of done that..it won't let me back on..
<pony_265909> what the HELL was that?
<Phase4> suddenly anon
<pony_265909> also, mfw I'm suddenly a random pony
<flutter_spin> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/202/d/4/friendship_is_magic_by_extvia-d416u0m.jpg oh my... look at those GOWNS
<pony_265909> oh well
<otakon|PONYCHAT> yh, just me on ponychat directly
<flutter_spin> sry. I was just brainstorming what Wrek should draw next
<Phase4> Shizuka: i cant get to bronystate.net at all, 31.170.160.83 is unrechable
<otakon|PONYCHAT> bc it seems bronystate stream is DEAD
<otakon|PONYCHAT> it's DED jim
<Shizuka> 13probably in the middle of shuffling IPs
<TOY_PON3> Bronystate is ded for me too
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Everyday it's shuffling?
<otakon|PONYCHAT> guys
<otakon|PONYCHAT> didn' you SEE the link I posted before?
<Shizuka> 13shared hosts don't typically give you statis addresses, that's why it's usually godawful expensive to get an SSL cert on them
<otakon|PONYCHAT> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.bronystate.net
<Phase4> Shizuka: do you know what dns server 000host uses?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soooo what i do should i read or play tf2 ?
<Polydunami> Dang it, human ponies
<Polydunami> How does that even work.
<otakon|PONYCHAT> what's wrong with humanized ponies?
<Shizuka> 13they tell me to point at..
<Phase4> i know that artist. not irl, seen his work before
<jffry890> im tryint to turn my sister into a pegasister. i think its working.
<Shizuka> 13ns01.000webhost.com and ns02.000webhost.com
<Polydunami> Nothing, it's just a little unsettling
<TOY_PON3> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Let's play tf2
<flutter_spin> I was just looking at the outfits. They look nice.
<otakon|PONYCHAT> I don't see how
<Polydunami> I'll get used to it I'm sure
<Phase4> that resolves to 31.170.163.18
<otakon|PONYCHAT> unless it's in a graphic sense or some such
<Shizuka> 13and yfw mtr-spamming bronystate.net gets through fine
<Polydunami> I'm just happy they're dressed up, to be honest
<flutter_spin> I'm weird that way. Sometimes I feel like Rarity, looking at only the outfits
<DaringDude> this video omg if you like bfbc3
<Phase4> mtr?
<DaringDude> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pcuUqlXKJQ

*Polydunami likes Derpy's new voice, but the character redesign was entirely uncalled for
<otakon|PONYCHAT> eeyup
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tell her hi from me ~
<CrimsonFoxx> I just had a random thought; what would the cast of Futurama do if they suddenly found themselves in Equestria?
<otakon|PONYCHAT> and THE FULL THEME KICKS ASS
<TOY_PON3> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Will do
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> xD
<RaveBrony> :D
*TOY_PON3 yells to his step sister, "HEY THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE SAID HI!"

<flutter_spin> http://sererena.deviantart.com/art/Futurama-Ponies-243942180
<otakon|PONYCHAT> CrimsonFoxx: Zoidburg would bunk with Pinkie, Leela would scoff at it but hang out with Twi, Bender would end up hugging Fluttershy and I don't know what els

*TOY_PON3 eyes grow wide
<otakon|PONYCHAT> Polydunami: they will try to hug Fluttershy ofc

<Dashie_Dashie> I'd even beat rainbow dash in a race.
<Polydunami> lol
<otakon|PONYCHAT> I know I would
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Yea, Lyra would flip out
<Polydunami> I'm getting major Mary Sue vibes here
<CrimsonFoxx> Speaking of humans in Equestria, has anyone here seen Turnabout Storm?
<DaringDude> what would you rather be as a pony unicorn,pegasi, or earth pony
<Dashie_Dashie> Pegasi
<flutter_spin> does anyone else just want to scream out FRRRRRIIIIIEEEENDSSSS everytime the intro ends?
<CrimsonFoxx> Pegasi
<RoflBot> no one wants to be a earth pony resulting in a flame war
<BronyinJapan> unicron
<TOY_PON3> Sooo...this is my reaction to the extended intro
<RaveBrony> I know i do, flutter_spin :)
<DaringDude> pegasi
*TOY_PON3 makes Hugh Jelly face "ME GUSTA!"
<Polydunami> If I HAD to be a pony, I'd go with unicorn
<RaveBrony> Lol!!
<DeathStar> flutter_spin: i do
<jffry890> the feeling of flight is what most people want to experience
<flutter_spin> ever since I saw that bronycon video, I scream it
<RaveBrony> That intro is nice, but it IS rather cheesy :D
<TOY_PON3> I would so be a unicorn
<OneTrickPony> I am sad :(
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony: Indeed :D
<jffry890> i think pegasi is the obvious choice
<MahBoi777> mmmmm cheesy
<flutter_spin> I would be a unicorn.
<Polydunami> Applejack of my eye :D
<TOY_PON3> a Rarity to come across :P
<DaringDude> as easy as pinkie pie
<Twi_Fi> I would be a unicorn. And then I would find a way to fly with magic.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Hurrican of puns
*OneTrickPony returns to painting

<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony: But I need to do homework first :(
<flutter_spin> aw, never gets old. Just love hearing every sing the intro
<TOY_PON3> Tomorrow will be DRAW day

<Midnight_Tempest> Arceus-pony|Fancy: it was because of some ignortant, and very arrogant, soccer moms that thought it was offensive...
<Mutterguy> with the magic of Dicebots!
<otakon|PONYCHAT> what video?
<Polydunami> I didn't care for Derpy's old voice too much
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Im pissed that they said Derpy would be fine
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> They lied to me!
<otakon|PONYCHAT> well it was the first voice
<MahBoi777> LIEZ
<otakon|PONYCHAT> it was the one they decided to stickt with
<otakon|PONYCHAT> I mean I don't mind the new voice
<otakon|PONYCHAT> but the edit is really badly done
*Mutterguy might need to find a room that will let us bring a dice bot though
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Fucking bullshit hasbro, lieing to the lot of us saying she was fine
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> how is it badly done?
<RaveBrony> Where do i get the old 'The Last Roundup'?
<otakon|PONYCHAT> and they basically take out ALL the significance of the scene
<Polydunami> Youtube
<Polydunami> DVD
<flutter_spin> :( My cat is on my bed. http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=so4k11&s=5 I guess its time to get some sleep

<Midnight_Tempest> the youtube version of derpy is fine, and even with hasbro changing her she's still my favorite wall-eyes pony
<DaringDude> night flutter
<Twi_Fi> It didn't sound like they put their heart into it when they did the reedit of Derpy's scene.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Now that pisses me off even more that makes it look like they didnt give a shit
<RaveBrony> Bye flutter_spin! Have a good sleep :)
<DaringDude> thnx for the youtube vids :)
<MahBoi777> gnight flutter_spin

<Twi_Fi> Yeah
<MahBoi777> Arceus-pony|Fancy: http://youtu.be/WORamP7xqHg
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I would love to meet the bitch who said Derpy was insulting mentally challanged people and slap her across the face

<CrimsonFoxx> I actually have a mental disability, and I wasn't offended by it
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Midnight_Tempest> Arceus-pony|Fancy: why are you so pissed off? Derpy will always be the way we want her to be no matter what, through fanart and stories and stuff like that... so being mad isnt something that you should be doing
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MFW ponies make me listen to kesha ~
<otakon|PONYCHAT> hiya AndyTheGeeky
*OneTrickPony whispers,"mods asleep; post ponies."
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Yea but the fact is they lied ot us and they said she would be fine
<MahBoi777> ohai AndyTheGeeky
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> They way they said fine would imply she would be Derpy name and all
<BronyinJapan> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWUdX4yhgK0 look at the top comments
<Twi_Fi> It probably was fine until shit hit the fan.
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> I mean only over protective over sensitive soccer moms would automaticly assume derpy was mocking mentally challenged people
<GabeMoist> Ohai
<Midnight_Tempest> Arceus-pony|Fancy: its all a PR thing so that Hasbro doesnt have to deal with the problem anymore... hell, im sure the artists didnt want to change her but they have to listen to the bosses
<DaringDude> you mean until shit hit the "fans"
<MahBoi777> at least we know there was that moment RD said Derpy, LOL
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> People need to fucking grow a back bone and stop being over sensitive
<Polydunami> Indeed
<AndyTheGeeky> Oh, hey o.o
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> Not everything is mocking someone you over sensitive twats

<KwakLad> applejack096: Sweetie belle!
<Kammerjunk> I used to be bored like you.
<Kammerjunk> But I'm watching Watchmen now.
<KwakLad> then i took a pony to the face
<applejack096> :S Im sooooooooooooooooo bored
<Snuffsis> I used to be bored, just like youk, but then i started creating MLP Pixel art in Terraria.
<Saturn> 08,01my body doesn't like me
<Kammerjunk> I really like the style Watchmen has.
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Did you insult it?
<Jim> Then assault your body with cake
<KwakLad> eyes giving you trouble still? Saturn
<applejack096> LOL wats that im about to search for the mlp fim minecraft now lol
<Saturn> 08,01i have papillary conjunctivitis in my eye, some kind of fungal infection/eczema on my arms, nose, and... another place, the tendonitis in my wrist just flaired up, and now it looks like i've got a worm living inside my gut
<Snuffsis> Jim: Like this?
<Kammerjunk> I didn't understand most of that, but it sounds bad.
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvG_LKVrFe8
<Saturn> 08,01oh body, y u so fooked?
<Dashie_Dashie> worm, gut? TAPE WORM.

<Dashie_Dashie> .___.
<Saturn> 08,01looks like it's time to go to the doctor
<Saturn> 08,01i blame living in this disgusting house
<valoreins> Saturn: watch this, i hope this makes you better http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4
<Snuffsis> Doctor Whooves is a very qualified doctor, i suggest you see him.
<Kammerjunk> Fun fact: Human tape worms can grow up to 22.9 meters.
<KwakLad> http://derpy.me/eFW7L
<Snuffsis> Fun Fact: Tape worms were used a method of diet in olden times.
<Saturn> 08,01valoreins: i see your gay he-man, and i raise you the full 2 minute extended intro of Friendship is Magic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4By8YHOnILo
<Snuffsis> That intro is so awesome
<valoreins> thx!
<Kammerjunk> >gay he man
<Snuffsis> <3
<Kammerjunk> Isn't that redundant?
<KwakLad> yeah the extended intro is awesome
<Snuffsis> He Man isn't gay!!
<Snuffsis> >:(
<valoreins> he's just happy
<CupcakeWarrior> Good morning everypony
<valoreins> gay=happy
<Kammerjunk> Oh, no. It just constantly makes unintented jokes about it.
<KwakLad> hulloo CupcakeWarrior
<valoreins> hiya
<Snuffsis> You mean like MP makes unintended jokes about... uhm, yea.
<Snuffsis> :D
<CupcakeWarrior> Also, holy crap
<CupcakeWarrior> @ the eextended intro
<Kammerjunk> Good, innit?
<Snuffsis> I wonder who is singing it
<valoreins> extended intro reminds me of WWU
<valoreins> it has a little feel of WWU arrangement
<Snuffsis> Not realrly a fan of long intros in general though, so i don't really hope it's a 2 minute long intro every episode.
<Kammerjunk> Wasn't the original intro sung by Tara Strong, or at least Twilight Sparkle's singing voice?
<Saturn> 08,01# when i was young i was too busy too make any friends #

<applejack096> Ohhh can someone PLZ STREAMMMMM!!!!!! SOOOO BOOOORRRREEEDDD!!!
<Coolbluemidnite> Go on youtube and listen to music thats what im doing (:
<CCCP> ^
<Coolbluemidnite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp&v=OEPSd5vho7Y&NR=1
<Coolbluemidnite> there music ^_^
<Snuffsis> OR help me with my math
<KwakLad> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQysdRTDIYE&feature=related CCCP
<KwakLad> Snuffsis what level of maths?
<Coolbluemidnite> Grr stop reminding me about meh maths GCSE next week T_T
<Coolbluemidnite> i alreaddy know im going to fail it
<Coolbluemidnite> x£
<CCCP> KwakLad: who is doing the presentation?
<KwakLad> CCCP dunno i just found another video
<Snuffsis> atm i'm doing repetitions of equations with sqr roots
<Coolbluemidnite> -derp-
<Snuffsis> like sqrtx-7 = x-5
<Snuffsis> and such
<KwakLad> Okay
<KwakLad> wanna try pm? Snuffsis?
<Snuffsis> Well, it was mostly a joke hu hu hu, i knwo how to do the math, it's just so boring to do repetitions
<Snuffsis> for the exam
<KwakLad> lol fair enough Suffsis
<Snuffsis> And in that case, you just do it like so : x-7 = (x-5)^2 which is x-7 = x^2-10x+25
<Snuffsis> and yea
<KwakLad> yup
<unfoundbug> algebra is the most fun part of maths
<Coolbluemidnite> Maths is fun?
<EspyLacopa> Which is (x+5)(x-5)
<KwakLad> nope EspyLacopa
<EspyLacopa> Well, almost.
<KwakLad> (x-5)(x-5)
<Snuffsis> :)
<EspyLacopa> ....
<Coolbluemidnite> ...
<EspyLacopa> They're the same thing, Kwaklad.
<KwakLad> nope EspyLacopa
<EspyLacopa> gah
<Snuffsis> Coolbluemidnite: Yea, it's really fun. :D
<Coolbluemidnite> xD if you say so
<unfoundbug> Maths is great
<EspyLacopa> Thought you had just swapped the + and -
<unfoundbug> way more useful than you give it credit for
<KwakLad> (x+5)(x-5) would make X^2-25
<Coolbluemidnite> Its useful but i dont find it fun cus i always get confused
<unfoundbug> hate differentiation though
<KwakLad> maths is all i do
<Snuffsis> What is evn more fun, albeit annoying, is trigonometry
<KwakLad> maths and physics but physics is the application of maths
<unfoundbug> trigs really easy though
<Dashie_Dashie> Well it's offical... Rarity is best pony.
<Dashie_Dashie> http://i.imgur.com/dyOJv.png
<Saturn> 08,01woohoo! BUCK IS ON EQD!
<Dashie_Dashie> proof
<EspyLacopa> Doesn't help though, since it's got that annoying x-7 on the side, and you have to solve for 0 in this type of equation.
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/nightly-roundup-250_26.html#more
<EspyLacopa> Becomes 0 = x^2 - 9x + 32
<Coolbluemidnite> lol
<Snuffsis> Actually it becomes a -x so its -11x
<KwakLad> Yup i saw Saturn, i soo wanna help out with that at a lower tier though
<unfoundbug> wb wrek
<Wrek> 05my internet is fucked
<EspyLacopa> Which still doesn't have handy factors you can fiddle with, so you've gotta break out the ever fun quadratic equation
<Saturn> 08,01EspyLacopa: are you trying to find the roots?
<Wrek> 05oh well
<Snuffsis> Yea, PQ-formula is easy though
<EspyLacopa> Well, I'm assuming you're trying to solve for x.
<Saturn> 08,01EspyLacopa: yeah, the roots
<Snuffsis> Yea, find the two xs and see if they fit in with the original one.
<Saturn> 08,01EspyLacopa: you can do it numerically
<Saturn> 08,01use Newton's Method
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=I-BtmZPc9Uc
<Coolbluemidnite> im reading but i dont understand .. i feel dumb :(
<Saturn> 08,01EspyLacopa: it's dead easy; start here, come to me if you have trouble: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=player_embedded
<Saturn> 08,01numerical analysis is kinda my bag
<Snuffsis> x=11/2 +- sqrt (-11/2)^2 - 32
<unfoundbug> Snuffsis i hope this isnt your homework
<Snuffsis> IT is repetition for an upcoming exam this saturday.
<Saturn> 08,01i always tend to find routes numerically, because it's algorithmic, and therefore turing computable
<Saturn> 08,01and i like turing computable functions
<Coolbluemidnite> Snuffsis good luck on the exam :)
*CupcakeWarrior hides from math

<Snuffsis> http://i.imgur.com/P28Gs.png
<Snuffsis> :'(
<Coolbluemidnite> T_T
<Tovler> for some reason, I say Brazzle Nut even though I say Brazil correctly when I speak of the country.
<Ingwaz> well...that was odd. I lost my ring that i wear probably a month or more ago, have looked for it a few times and could never find it, look to my left today and there it is on the floor
<Coolbluemidnite> lol x3
<Snuffsis> To much Brazziers
<Ingwaz> glad i finally found it, my finger has been feeling rather naked without it
<Coolbluemidnite> XD
<Snuffsis> THe ring trolled you.
<CupcakeWarrior> :D
<Coolbluemidnite> x]
<Ingwaz> i'm just happy i actually found it, it must have been hiding somewhere and got shuffled aroudn so it fell out
<Coolbluemidnite> Its always in the last place you look
*Tovler goes to youtube to see how people say Brazil Nut.
<Ingwaz> Coolbluemidnite: literally, yes
<Ingwaz> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-again.jpg
<applejack096> Im bored
*CupcakeWarrior has no idea what a Brazil Nut is
<Coolbluemidnite> xD
<Coolbluemidnite> Its a type of nut
<applejack096> borrred
<Snuffsis> Do you know about the Brazil Nut effect?
<Coolbluemidnite> Again
<Coolbluemidnite> Nope what is it?
<applejack096> yes Snuffis
<otakon> Morning all, what's up?
<Snuffsis> Brazil Nuts are always at the top of the bag if you buy a bag of mixed nuts
<Coolbluemidnite> Haii otakon
<applejack096> hi otakon
<otakon> hiya Coolbluemidnite, applejack096
<Snuffsis> And if you turn it around, shake it a while, they will appear at the top once again. :P
<Coolbluemidnite> I need to buy a bag of mixed nuts now
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/P28Gs.png

<Dashie_Dashie> I concur.
<Saturn> 08,01i've seen so many of this type of post
<Saturn> 08,01it's great
<Snuffsis> I just linked that saturn, you're slow! :P
<Ingwaz> brazil nuts are nasty
<Saturn> 08,01oh, bugger
<Flim> Sooo sweet derpy Saturn i feel bad for her
<otakon> Saturn: I have one better
<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: brazil nuts ARE. THE. SHIT.
<applejack096> +Saturn can u stream?? Or r u not allowed??
<Saturn> 08,01and that's the technical term
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=g-u-u&context=G2751c51FUAAAAAAAAAA
<Saturn> 08,01applejack096: i be not allowed :(

<Saturn> 08,01after that incident with the pies and the beans
<otakon> Pies and beans?
<Snuffsis> Yea, i've been having that one on repeat otakon. i'm crying rivers
<Tovler> I like brazil nuts, they're a little on the big side.
<Saturn> 08,01took weeks to get the stains out...
<applejack096> Ohhh i want somepony to stream!!!
<Snuffsis> Had to grav a roll of toiletpaper. xD
<applejack096> :'(
<otakon> Snuffsis: yh, I can't stop watching it either myself.
<Saturn> 08,01but i'm not allowed to talk about that
<Snuffsis> But you arer talking about it
<Snuffsis> so, what happens now?
<Flim> Saturn always a good jest
<Snuffsis> Damn you nature, screwing with my mind, it actually doesn't mix things up for me when i shake ranomd things together, but rather aligns them in layers!
<Snuffsis> hahaha
<Snuffsis> Unbelievable ignorance, big, small, light, heavy................. bollox.
<Snuffsis> God moves the Brazil? nuts to the top because they taste the best.
<Kammerjunk> I don't like nuts.
<CupcakeWarrior> Neither do I
<Saturn> 08,01pumba sounds like nappa from DBZ Abridged
<DashingRainbow> Hey 8D
<Kammerjunk> Aside from Vince's nuts.
<Kammerjunk> You're gonna love his nuts.
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Snuffsis> I love my own nuts, thank you
<DashingRainbow> ...I walk into this convo.
<Kammerjunk> Yes.
<DashingRainbow> And my reaction...."wtf"
<Kammerjunk> Vince is the Shamwow guy, you know.
<DashingRainbow> Yeah
<DashingRainbow> asiudfhui
<CCCP> +__0
<Tovler> man, I wonder why I tolerated the Timon and Pumbaa cartoon as a kid?
<CCCP> is it sad that ive only told one person i know im a brony?
<Snuffsis> IT's okay derpy, it isn't your fault!! It's those damn haters! :(:(
<otakon> I know man, I know.
<BronyinJapan> CCCP ive told my family and some of my friends
<Snuffsis> Lion King is awesome.
<otakon> CCCP: nah, but it is if you only know that one guy however
<otakon> it is
<CCCP> lol
<otakon> I SWEAR there's a "line" bit in it though
<otakon> I can hear someone faintly say "brother" before Mufasa does when Scar has him by the paws
<Saturn> 08,01time to listen to The Who

<otakon> hiya Wrek
<DashingRainbow> o.o
<DashingRainbow> No youtube links during streams...
<kenne88> oh the streams up now!
<Wrek> 05lets see how this works
*Dashie_Dashie headbangs
<Tovler> there's a stream?
<DashingRainbow> I thought so.
<DashingRainbow> o.e
<Dashie_Dashie> Great choice of music Wrek.
<DashingRainbow> Applejack096 I think it's too late.
<Snuffsis> awesome music! :D
<CCCP> HOLY SHIT A STREAM!!!
<BronyinJapan> applejack096 wow i did not know there was a website on saving Derpy
<CupcakeWarrior> You know, I never really cared about the whole Derpy thing
<kenne88> alls i know is im watching something and it sounds like metallicas playing in the backround im like wha 0_o
<DashingRainbow> I cared, I'm still angry about it.
<applejack096> Yep have u watched the derpy vid??
<DashingRainbow> But...I mean she's not DEAD or anything.
<Kirakura> ponies?
<BronyinJapan> ya made me shed manly tears
<applejack096> its soo sad
<Snuffsis> But she was forced to change her personality because people didn't accept her the way she was!!
<Saturn> 08,01http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sopa-be-gone.jpg
<applejack096> i kno!
<Snuffsis> That is not what you should teach kids
<otakon> DashingRainbow: she's all but dead, Hasbro has basically said doing this"NO, SHE NEVER HAPPENED". If Studio B thought it was good to show, and they showed it I stand behind their decision.
<Kirakura> who framed rogger rabbit!
<DashingRainbow> Okay...?
<applejack096> SIGN THE PETITON NOW SAVE DERPYS LIFE!!!!! 6_9
<otakon> I mean her first showing ofc, the one that everyone loved and cheered for
<otakon> I CAN'T IT WON'T LET ME!!!
<Kirakura> omfg
<DashingRainbow> What's this? On the stream?
<DashingRainbow> ...Whoa
<otakon> I have no idea
<otakon> but this should be good
<Dashie_Dashie> people are poking at the situation to much.
<Ingwaz> da phoque?
<otakon> damn, but I need moar coffee
<otakon> lol
<applejack096> I refreshed browser soo wat have i missed?
<Snuffsis> what you mean Otakon, the first showing of derpy being called erpy and such never happened?
<otakon> Snuffsis: yes. They are basically saying now, that Derpy never happened.
<applejack096> DOCTOR WHO TUNE!!!!!!
<DashingRainbow> Time for em to go
<DashingRainbow> me*
<Snuffsis> That is a load of bollocks honestly. :(
<DashingRainbow> Seeyaaa
<Ingwaz> i'm still waiting on some official word, there are possible other reasons why it happened otakon
<Kirakura> they can't deny
<Dashie_Dashie> Constant buffering on my end.
<Dashie_Dashie> not sure if me.
<DashingRainbow> Yeah I'm with Ingwaz...
<Ingwaz> but i'm still supporting all of the petitons and movements to bring her back
<Snuffsis> It buffers quite a bit for me as well
<DashingRainbow> But anyway, I gotta go.
<DashingRainbow> See you guys later
<otakon> Ingwaz: they haven't ever gone back and changed around any OTHER scenes in the show before now.
<BronyinJapan> Guys it is okay Hasbro just changed on DVD ans on iTunes but it pisses me off that they wont show her talk in future episodes
<otakon> and yet NO ONE found the rythming zebra offensive
<alexxm> cya DashingRainbow
<CupcakeWarrior> Its still on Youtube guys
<applejack096> LOL I wanna watch Doctor Who know prefferabally the weeping ajgels with matt smith!! :P
<otakon> No, it's the fan named Derpy Hooves, mare of a thousand adventures
<Tovler> Well, Zecora was portrayed in a positive light.
<otakon> I think the only other pony that's more popular is Octavia
<Ingwaz> even if it is the worst case scenario otakon, it wont cause me to abandon MLP, i will simply be disappointed on hasbro and put them on a sort of "probation"
<Snuffsis> http://tranquilmind.deviantart.com/art/Derpy-is-Excited-281652870 awwwww
<Saturn> 08,01http://speccysy.deviantart.com/art/Pie-Sisters-Parkour-287233952
<otakon> Ingwaz: I'm not abadoning MLP, Studio B didn't do this, it was whatever group of haters managed to whine and roar loud enough.
<Dashie_Dashie> So much buffering..
<Dashie_Dashie> -_-
<Dashie_Dashie> brb
<Wrek> 05oh?
<Ingwaz> otakon: thats part of why i think there may be some other reason, i've heard very very few people voice an opinion against derpy
<Ingwaz> something seems to be going on, as some have said, its possible its itune's decision, apparently they are notorious for being strict on the content they allow sometimes
<otakon> Hell, even emangamer thought the scene was pandering and he's not happy with this change of events either.
<SonicRainboom> That's quite possible.
<otakon> lol
<SonicRainboom> Revised plan: Let's go find where Itunes is based and burn it down, first.
<applejack096> whos streaming??
<otakon> hmmm maybe
<alexxm> is it lagging for anyone else
<otakon> Wrek is
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> I think he's fiddling with the embed

<BronyinJapan> noooooooooooooo Fluttershy
<Wrek> 05lag gone?
<Ingwaz> did dashie just put up a psychic shield?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat dead Fluttershy
<otakon> It's fine on my end Wrek
<Tovler> huh wut?
<Ingwaz> for the most part wrek
<otakon> that was damn odd
<otakon> ah this one.
<Tovler> oh. I missed dead fluttershy
<Snuffsis> REDLINE! :D
<Kirakura> what happened to fluttershy?
<Wrek> 05died in the new EP
<Wrek> 05its mane5 now
<applejack096> i want doctor who on plzzz :'(:'(:P
<Tovler> lolol, Radical Girl Scouts always makes me laugh
<otakon> NOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kirakura> so go put derpy instead!!
<Kirakura> the element of... derp
<otakon> Derpy the new Element of Kindness?
<Ingwaz> wow wrek...you're cruel
<pony_8106> SMILE FOR ANIME
<Wrek> 05old news
<Tovler> Derpy is a Radical Girl Scout. We must put a stop to her.
<Kirakura> derpy is kind
<Wrek> 05srsly im pissed as hell on my ISP right now
<Saturn> 08,01Derpy is Element of Calamity
<Wrek> 05RAEG
<Wrek> 05>dubstep
<Wrek> 05>not sure if lag or part of the song
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<Cole> What wrong with Derpy Hooves?
<Kirakura> lmao
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: "we have replaced your internets with dubstep. all day. every day."
<Ingwaz> lol wrek
<Tovler> inb4 Derpy is replaced with Screwball using her propellor beanie to fly.
<SonicRainboom> That'd be no fun.
<Saturn> 08,01i think discord got to hasbro
<Saturn> 08,01fucked up derpy
<Saturn> 08,01+[yay]
<Kirakura> so he's still alive
<SonicRainboom> The cross-eyes are what hold all of Derpy's charm.
<Saturn> 08,01i don't think the derp eyes are changed
<kenne88> oooo are we doing something now
<Saturn> 08,01just the voice and the name
<Cole> R.I.P Derpy Hooves 2010-2012. May the muffins be with you!
<Kirakura> they are
<SonicRainboom> Discord got out?
<SonicRainboom> Shit.
<Saturn> 08,01SonicRainboom: yes i di-- er, he did
<SonicRainboom> Get my Orbital Friendship Cannon.
<pony_8106> AND IIIIIIIIIII EE IIIII WILL ALWAYS LOOOOVE YOOOOOOOOOOU!!!
<Dashie_Dashie> Twilight, grab my wub wubs
*Tovler eats a bagel in honour of Derpy.
<Kirakura> is the music laggy?
<SonicRainboom> I know love and tolerate, but I'm seriously sick of how they always let the villian go.
<alexxm> a bit for me
<CupcakeWarrior> What is he doing?
<Kirakura> doom2?
<Kirakura> lmao
<Snuffsis> AWW YEA
<Dashie_Dashie> Honestly, I don't see why it's a huge deal with derpy.. She went back to the way she was before she became canon, minus the eye edit.
<CupcakeWarrior> She is still canon
<Ingwaz> Dashie_Dashie: its a huge deal because if hasbro is willing to go back and change something that a very small minority supposedly complained about, they will go back and change everything
<CupcakeWarrior> There will still be fanfics about her at least
<Ingwaz> zecora? the apparently african pony? she could easily be changed. Barking pony from the hospital? changed
<Saturn> 08,01http://harwicks-art.deviantart.com/art/Wishes-On-Stars-Are-Her-Jurisdiction-287123518
<Snuffsis> Also, because she was "Different" :O
<Ingwaz> any number of things could be complained about, and all of them changed
<Kirakura> go use rickroll doom!
<Snuffsis> Damn saturn, that is awesome
<Cole> Give all muffins and flowers to a grave of Derpy Hooves.
<Tovler> (Melissa Harris-Perry is having too much fun on her show. I'm glad I can watch her show Saturdays at 10am now)
<Ingwaz> also, as Snuffsis said, the complaint was apparently because shes different, if thats the case, thats beyond intolerant
<Tovler> I'm so shameless
<CupcakeWarrior> dat doom music
<SonicRainboom> I've got a better idea. Someone, go invent a muffin that explodes.
<Saturn> 08,01Snuffsis: i love the anme
<Saturn> 08,01*name
<Snuffsis> The name, of the picture?
<Ingwaz> i missed the part where equestria was a place where only cookie cutter perfect ponies could exist and everypony who happened to be different physically wasnt allowed
<otakon> SonicRainboom: but Derpy LIKES muffins!
<BronyinJapan> ah cool playing Doom
<Cole> I <3 Derpy Hooves. Now he dead.
<Kirakura> BFG 9000!
<otakon> Ingwaz: it's Bridle Gossip IRL!
<SonicRainboom> I bet someone working at Hasbro is eating a muffin right now without caring.
<Tovler> Derpy invented a muffin that's also child pony doctor.
<Saturn> 08,01i don't believe in prayer, but... i will admit to maybe having wished upon a star to luna a time or two...
<Ingwaz> otakon: i dont get the reference?
<CCCP> Doom
<applejack096> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRv59GJVSlQ can we watch just this part of docter who and then thats it u have wat everyone else wants!! I mean it plz
<otakon> Ingwaz: in Bridle Gossip everyone was afraid of Zecora for being different i.e. a Zebra.
<Saturn> 08,01SonicRainboom: make life take the muffins back?
<Kirakura> omg a mancubus on the very first level
<Tovler> The Twilight movie ruined Muffins for me forever.
<otakon> Kirakura: it's a high difficulty mod.
<Snuffsis> Saturn: http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/145/8/9/mission_accomplished_by_miketheuser-d3h756k.png :)
<Ingwaz> ahh i see, bsically yes, derpy is different, so we fear what we do not understand
<Kirakura> ultraviolence?
<otakon> eeyup agains DEMONS!!!!!!
<Kirakura> nice
<otakon> nice, my little portal
<Saturn> 08,01Snuffsis: asdlfkhfvb naslfkjahsdlfkjhsadf
<Ingwaz> perhaps we should get a group together for MM8BDM sometime
<Saturn> 08,01Snuffsis: that was the sound of my brain imploding with adorableness
<Snuffsis> :D
<Dashie_Dashie> is it just the itunes version that was changed?
<Cole> The New Derpy Hooves at Hasbro? "Derpy Hooves X! with Old voice and name!"
<Kirakura> LUNA
<Kirakura> ♥
<Ingwaz> Dashie_Dashie: we're unsure on that, hasbro has yet to clarify
<Kirakura> imps still alive
<Dashie_Dashie> if it was JUST itunes, then it wasn't hasbro behind it.
<Cole> Sweetie Belle says SOUP.
<Dashie_Dashie> apple hired their own editors to cover their ass against a lawshuit
<Kirakura> revenants! omfg
<Dashie_Dashie> lawsuit*
<ThatsAShinySky> Hey people! Returning from speeds stack practice
<alexxm> i heard it was just the itunes version
<Ingwaz> Dashie_Dashie: indeed, but they have yet to say, and they've been silent the entire time this has been happening, so, no on knows but it does not look good on hasbro's part to keep everyone int he dark like this
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: atm yes. but we'll only know for sure when The Last Roundup is shown on TV again as a rerun.
<Tovler> So outside of TV and iTunes, she's still Derpy… man, f**k that
<Cole> Reeeeeeeeeeeerun!!!!!!!!
<Cole> Yay.
<otakon> ThatsAShinySky: how'd it go, and what's Speed Stacks?
<SonicRainboom> Shotguns now shoot lasers?
<SonicRainboom> What?
<applejack096> this is boring something else plz
<ThatsAShinySky> It went fine otakon.
<Kirakura> i remember the DBZ Doom
<Ingwaz> i believe the last roundup is still available on my free dvr unchanged, but most likely they would not have changed it and just waited until it came around again
<alexxm> Tovler isn't that the way it used to be no offense
<ThatsAShinySky> It's just basically stacking cups in specific combinations.
<Saturn> 08,01i wish portal 2 had a Tourettes Core
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<Snuffsis> You're back sky?! :O
<otakon> oh I've heard of that before. I couldn't do that, I'm not quick enough
<Cole> Who survived the first night on Minecraft?
<Ingwaz> alexxm: the problem is that theyre changing something because supposedly some people found it offensive because derpy was different
<otakon> okay, brb need MOAR COFFEE
<Wrek> 05oo
<Wrek> 05minecraft
<Ingwaz> if theyre willing to do that, they'll change anything
<Wrek> 05who's up for some?
<otakon> no ammo's!
<alexxm> is it lagging for anyone else
<Dashie_Dashie> memememememe Wrek

<alexxm> ah ok first i've heard about the new voice
<Dashie_Dashie> Doom II rubbish?

<otakon> and I have the "connection powered by cockney orphans, made of wood" as Meanwhile puts it.
<Saturn> 08,01so this is awesome: http://harwicks-art.deviantart.com/#/d4j5zr3

*Tarku gives Ingwaz a smile :)
*Meanwhile explodes in smiles and rainbows.
<otakon> it's 5 bucks tops considering the production values
<Ingwaz> otakon: its an extremely large, open world sandbox game where you can do pretty much anything you want
<Ingwaz> its done retro style on purpose
<Paradise92> Friendship will always win...
<CupcakeWarrior> dat voice
<Snuffsis> The game was 10 bucks at the start.
*Dashie_Dashie joins servers
<otakon> Ingwaz: yeah, but it looks like my PHONE could run it.

<Snuffsis> The only mod you need it Technic Pack. :D
<Snuffsis> is*
<Meanwhile> otakon: eenope.
<otakon> and I have the "connection powered by cockney orphans, made of wood" as Meanwhile puts it.
<Kammerjunk> otakon: Let's say that hypothetically, your phone can run Java. You run Minecraft on it.
<unfoundbug> i dislikke technic pack
<Kammerjunk> Your phone would hate you forever.
<Saturn> 08,01well, you've had d'aww, now for some b'aaw: http://harwicks-art.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4hhh93
<Ingwaz> i would join you guys, but i dont have minecraft, i'm not really a sandbox type of guy
<unfoundbug> didnt get permission off mod authors
<otakon> Kammerjunk: omg, it CAN run Java
<Cole> Wood from the future..
<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek you're name is "Player" on MC

<applejack096> @Wrek If thats u talkin on minecraft say hi Applejack098

<Ingwaz> chicken esploded!!
<Cole> >2012
<otakon> Guys, is there a mod in this where if you attack a chicken, a whole FLOCK of chickens come out of nowhere to attack you?
<Cole> >New Mob. Scootaloo.
<Kammerjunk> That's because chickens are evil.
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: my phone can run java

<Kammerjunk> I'm just waiting for my iPhone to break.
<Meanwhile> otakon's phone is from 1889 and runs on steam.

<Meanwhile> Ty Kammerjunk.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I don't know.
<Kammerjunk> I just like vegetables.
<Tarku> Paradise92: try clearing the cache?
<Kammerjunk> Because VEGETABLES! What does the scouter say about his power level?
<Saturn> 08,01Paradise92: try reinstalling flash, clearing your cache, etc.
<Paradise92> Tarku like i said it doesn't work...they already tried to help me
