<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If lighting strikes your house, you'll be fine as long as you're not touching anything metal.

*FlareChaser is awesome
<iammrcrap> i think maybe....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Induction?
<ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: houses actually are normally required to have a ground, so you'd be fine regardless i believe, provided your house is grounded
<twilight_sprinkler> GilDash: thats only if youre surrounded by aconductor
<Dashite> RaveBrony: the correct response is "My hair is on fire! My hair is fire!"
<RaveBrony> I got my soul taken from FlareChaser apparently >.>
*icybeauti chants fire like beavis.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You mean Faraday cage?

<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: but the house isnt all metal, doesnt the cage have to be a conductor?

*Om just laughs at Gillysuit
<cachi01> hi Invi!
<Reikim> alexxm: Fantastic, bordering on magnificent. For once, I actually got some work done.
<icybeauti> GilDash: All you really need to know is that pinkie nor chuck norris apply to the rules of physics.
<cachi01> wut are u talking about the creator of 4chan???????''
<iammrcrap> Guess what I'm doing as we all speak?
<FlareChaser> ...awww
<alexxm> what work fo you do Reikim
<Invi> icybeauti and the people of star wars
<icybeauti> Who did create the god forsaken place. Invi....Right them too.
<GilDash> icybeauti: Neither do I apparently. I've done some physically impossible stuff before. In front of Doctors in physics. :D
<cachi01> iammrcrap: typing
<alexxm> what iammrcrap
<CCCP> i love a rainy night
<Reikim> alexxm: Things and stuff. Mostly trying to teach myself programming, a bit of writing, etc., etc.
<iammrcrap> i am reading homesuck
<CCCP> iammrcrap: clopping?
<icybeauti> I like rain if there isn't thunder.
<Invi> GilDash you created a time paradox?
<iammrcrap> *homestuck
<GilDash> Invi: I froze ice-water with salt. :D
<RaveBrony> CCCP: Same :3
<alexxm> hows it coming along Reikim
<CCCP> RaveBrony: O_O
<Pinkies4thWall|busy> lightning is best fireworks
<iammrcrap> im in the begginning of act 3
<RaveBrony> CCCP: I love a rainy night >.>
<RaveBrony> didnt see the other thing u said
<Reikim> alexxm: Poorly. Lack of motivation and proper programming excercise means I never actually practice anything...
<icybeauti> My dog goes commando when she hears thunder. Even me, who's scared, lols at it.
<Pinkies4thWall|busy> guys, i had SO much fun at the air show yesterday
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: someone is getting famous :P now you know whow I feel with 500 people talking to me at once...
<Invi> GilDash why is that physically impossible? We did that too
<iammrcrap> it such a good anime
<HatsuneMikuFan> I like Rain from MK :D
<CCCP> i love the thunder as it lights up the sky RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> Yaya ^

<drf-Droid> Black 3
<FlareChaser> Niko! My Cousin!!!
<Vinyer> droid
<cachi01> its called manga
<GilDash> Invi: When you add salt to water it increases it's salinity, thus increasing the freezing point (or ice melts faster). I managed to *freeze* the water there. :D
<drf-Droid> starts in ~20 mins
<icybeauti> HatsuneMikuFan: Paintball sounds cool.
<RaveBrony> Pinkies4thWall|busy: Dat cat! /)^3^(\
<ingwaz> CCCP: uhh...okay? i didnt bring up 4chan at all though

<FlareChaser> back :3
<RaveBrony> *Everypony o.o
<CCCP> ingwaz: u seem to do it REALLY WELL *rolling eyes*
<Invi> GilDash when you put salt into water, the entropy of the salt gets a lot higher and consumes a lots of thermal energy so water without salt nearby that solution freezes
<CCCP> alexxm: D:
<Pinkies4thWall|busy> Cipher: the thunderbirds. they performed. and i was there
<Cipher> 0,14niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice
<HatsuneMikuFan> Anyone up for L4D2(Xbox)?

<alexxm> how was it Pinkies4thWall|busy
<cachi01> HatsuneMikuFan: me
<Om> GilDash: That was plain.
<cachi01> HatsuneMikuFan: just wait till i get to my house like in 30 minutes

<Pinkies4thWall> alexxm: BEST EVENT EVER
<CCCP> ingwaz: yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do too.
<Invi> GilDash salt crystal gets broke => it gets colder => water freezes near the salt water
*FlareChaser loves Nittany_Discord
<alexxm> good to hear you liked it Pinkies4thWall

<cachi01> bye guys i will be back in 30 minutes
<FlareChaser> If you get a ping from a mod, you get closer to Equestria, isnt that right Nittany_Discord ?
<Pinkies4thWall> RaveBrony: How the buck do you HEAR lightning
*RaveBrony misses hurricane season in Florida :'(
<Pinkies4thWall> ?
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye cachi01

<RaveBrony> Yes, i like SEING lightning, and Hearing thunder! Ty, Pinkies4thWall :$
<alexxm> GilDash thats to dispell ghosts
<Pinkies4thWall> Invi: no. thunder is the air coming back together after lightning
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hate rain strom teams that uses thunder
<GilDash> alexxm: If you say so... :S
<Invi> GilDash rock = salt as far as i know ^^
<GilDash> Invi: Fine! Sodium Chloride. :p
<FlareChaser> ....
<alexxm> GilDash have you heard of a show called supernatural
<FlareChaser> chat r ded
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FlareChaser: Uhhhhh
<GilDash> alexxm: Yeah, but I know nothing of it.
<FlareChaser> Nittany_Discord: OH! that was my last ping, I get to go to Equestria now!
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: ahhh now i finally get why RD is your fav
<Invi> GilDash oh that stuff ^^ we call it Kochsalz here ^^ (cooking salt)
<Pinkies4thWall> So many PM's being had in chat
<alexxm> well in that show they use bullets used out of rock salt to fight ghosts GilDash
<HatsuneMikuFan> Pinkies4thWall: dem PM's
<GilDash> Invi: Oh, okay. :D
<Pinkies4thWall> HatsuneMikuFan: I C WUT U DID THATR
<Pinkies4thWall> THAR
<HatsuneMikuFan> :D
<FlareChaser> Time to have some fun with Octavia, if you know what I mean...
*Pinkies4thWall gives HatsuneMikuFan an internet
<FlareChaser> Orchestra! :D
<GilDash> alexxm: You know you can use cartridges filled with rock salt in shotguns as a non-lethal alternative.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twilight_sprinkler: Because she's a weather pony?
<Invi> GilDash I'm too lazy to calculate that stuff xD
<alexxm> yeah GilDash
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: yeah, lightning, tornadoes, etc.
<GilDash> Invi: Don't worry. I wouldn't know where to start. :D
<Invi> ^^
*HatsuneMikuFan looks at the internet
<Om> Numbers!
<twilight_sprinkler> took me long enough
<GilDash> alexxm: I don't even know how I found that out. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like RD's personality and her involvement with weather.
<GilDash> Om: Where? Where are they?!
<Cypresswolf> Im starting to get the hang of Minecraft
<Om> GilDash: In your head, making more numbers
<Woodenfan> hi again
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: equally?
<alexxm> i ust guessed something simular could happen in real life GilDash
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: never played Minecraft before?
<FlareChaser> I dislike Rainbow Dash.
<Woodenfan> gonna do TF2 tutorials for all classes
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Woodenfan
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: When she's done right. Mare Do Well ticked me off, but I think Hurricane Fluttershy was a perfect match with her personality.
<alexxm> hey Woodenfan hows your day been
<FlareChaser> shes the least favorite of the mane6 for me.
<Cypresswolf> no, just started yesterday
<Woodenfan> Gildash: Hurricane Fluttershy made me cry :'( I felt so bad for her
<GilDash> Om: More numbers? Well, if you insist. ;)
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: PC or Xbox?
<Cypresswolf> PC
<HatsuneMikuFan> oh
<Om> GilDash: Damit not what I meant.
*alexxm hugs Woodenfan
<Woodenfan> And FlareChaser, I know how you feel, I think she's too brash and too eager to start fights. Too simple-minded and greedy as well.
<Woodenfan> sorry
<GilDash> Woodenfan: Yeah, I knew she was going to react badly, but when she burst out crying it actually hit me pretty hard.
<Woodenfan> anyways to TF2
<iammrcrap> when can we watch something?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twilight_sprinkler: Dunno.
<GilDash> Om: When will you learn? :D
<FlareChaser> Woodenfan: exactly
<Om> I don't know why everyone gets up in arms about Mare do well.
<twilight_sprinkler> heh kk
<Reikim> So...is there a stream, or am I just terminally prone to lag?
<Om> GilDash: Probably... a very long time from noww
<Biglaw> hey everypomy! I'm back!
<Invi> GilDash i guess he appreciates it ^^
<Biglaw> Pony*
<Invi> moin Biglaw ^^
<Cipher> 0,14Stream is on pause for now, I believe
<iammrcrap> Reikim: well i'm not getting anything either
<alexxm> hey Biglaw hows your day been
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Biglaw!
<GilDash> Om: I've got all the time in the world to wait for you. ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mare-do-well was OK. Worst episode of S2. Not bad by itself, though.
<Biglaw> alexxm fine
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It just had nothing special.
<iammrcrap> hi BigLaw
<Cypresswolf> I made some iron armor, explored a cave on peaceful mode - died once from skeletal archer
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Best episode of S2?
<Om> GilDash: e_e I thought you were a nice drunk
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: And I think they butchered RD's personality to an extent for the plot. :S
<GilDash> Om: I am. :)
<iammrcrap> Reikim: A Canterlot Wedding parts 1 & 2
<ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: i thought it was pretty funny, and it did have an important lesson for RD, celestia knows she needed some character development in that department
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. RD became arrogant in Mare Do Well.
<Om> GilDash: I dissent.
<GabeMoist> I have saved this lawn!
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: She always was, they just decided to play it up for the episode.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Not to mention a severe case of the idiot ball. Seriously, they never even tried to talk to her? =_(\
<iammrcrap> Gabe<oist hurray!!
<FlareChaser> My least favorite MLP episode is The Show Stoppers.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: Once you find diamond for the first time it will be the greatest thing ever
<FlareChaser> I dont know why, I just...it was...meh.
<twilight_sprinkler> GilDash: they did as i recall
<ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: lol, she always was, just like rarity can come off as greedy some times, i meant the resolution of the matter
<GilDash> Om: I'll have to ignore you, because I don't know what that word means and I don't care to look it up. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Applejack a liar?
<FlareChaser> I like Twilight Sparkle out of the whole mane6
<FlareChaser> the most
<Cypresswolf> HatsuneMikuFan: I assume diamonds are found in harder difficulty - I've found some HUGE coal veins and iron ore so far
<Invi> FlareChaser /)
<iammrcrap> Flare Chaser: I like fluttershy
<Reikim> GilDash: It means he disagrees é).=
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkler: They never actually pulled her off to the side and told her she's acting out of turn. Every time they expressed their dissaproval it was never so RD could here it.
<Om> GilDash: It means dissagree. And its easyer to spell
<GabeMoist> Cypresswolf, are you a miner?
<GilDash> Om: Irrelevant. :)
<RyunosukeKnT> well... a show where someponey does NOT have to work through thier character flaws?!?
<RyunosukeKnT> what?
<Cypresswolf> GabeMoist: no
<FlareChaser> my Brony friend HATES Rarity, what do I do?
<ingwaz> GilDash: rd isnt really the type to sit and listen though is she?
<Om> GilDash: You drunk what would you know.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: No, just start digging deep down underground.
<twilight_sprinkler> GilDash: she probably wouldve ignored them anyway
<icybeauti> I luuvv rarity.
<Reikim> Om: Ironic, that some of the less-common words are easier on the fingers.
<alexxm> were you talking about minecraft Cypresswolf
<GilDash> ingwaz: And that would've been fine because they would have tried before they schemed. But they didn't, which makes it idiot ball.
<RyunosukeKnT> I firmly believe that there is no "Best pony"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fluttershy only broke kindness in S2 with Putting Your Hoof Down.
<Cypresswolf> HatsuneMikuFan: can I find diamond in peaceful mode? I dont want to venture too deep otherwise
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkler: See my comment to ingwaz.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're going to exclude discorded Fluttershy.
<RyunosukeKnT> each one has thier own strengths and weeknesses
<Om> Reikim: Yeah, english is weird.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: Yeah
<ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: and trapping small animals and chasing them down when they CLEARLY did not want to be near her at all
<RyunosukeKnT> What about dragonshy?
<RyunosukeKnT> what about the cockatrice?
<Reikim> GilDash: Or maybe "the writers only have less than half an hour to work through a complex plot wherein one of Dash's fatal character flaws is exploited".
<GilDash> Om: You'd be surprised just how well I can handle myself whilst drunk. :)
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: she also went a bit berserk when they tried to get er to the dragon migration, plus the gala ep, plus the stare
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She got assertive, but not mean.
<GilDash> Reikim: It just seemed too OOC even for Dash.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess.
<GilDash> Reikim: I guess that's just me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She did go nuts at the Gala.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, she got mad
<FlareChaser> want to know how bad I am at math?
<Cypresswolf> HatsuneMikuFan: I'm still trying to figure out how to craft better weapons - I know I cant get string from wool :)
<GabeMoist> she didn't get Glad
<Om> GilDash: I really don't want to eke you on any more then. e_e
<RyunosukeKnT> assertiveness and mean is a fine line sometimes Nittany_Discord
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Didn't she have a go at Pinkie Pie and Rarity though, practically driving Rarity to tears? :S
<FlareChaser> Okay this is how bad I am bad at math: My last math grade was 34.
<Reikim> GilDash: Not really. There are a lot who agree with you. Most of us just let it be and remain thankful that we even have the show.
<FlareChaser> :|
<Cipher> 0,14She should've gotten Glad, GabeMoist, I hear it's a good brand
<FlareChaser> thats low
<RyunosukeKnT> but.. at teh end of putting your hoof down, she showed that you can be... assertive.. and nice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I said Putting Your Hoof Down was when Fluttershy broke her kindness.
<alexxm> alestorm is a good band i recomend it
<Cypresswolf> Also found I can run Minecraft better from external hard drive - less laggy - might have to move all my games to external hard drive now
<GilDash> Reikim: Hey, I'm not one to harp on about it. It's just what I thought, would've been fine otherwise.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But someone brought up Best Night Ever.
<twilight_sprinkler> *i did*
<GabeMoist> Alestorm, oh yes, I had that streamed here once
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: Just remember that your imagination is your limit
<twilight_sprinkler> fluttershy is eeeeveeeel
<alexxm> what song GabeMoist
<ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: every member of the mane 6 has at least one serious character flaw that has to do with their element. they'd be rather poor characters if they were complete saints
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Still trying to figure out why that happened, without resorting to Rule of Drama or Rule of Funny
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alright. Storm's mostly passed.
<GabeMoist> You are a Pirate
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: is that good or bad for you?
<alexxm> ya gobshite
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good.
<ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: awww, i like storms
<twilight_sprinkler> yah i like storms too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can stream again.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like storms.
<twilight_sprinkler> i hate bright sun
<GilDash> Reikim: Cutie Mark Failure Insanity Syndrome. Or, CMFIS.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just don't need one right now.
<Om> In my opinion the worst episodes are the ones that don't stand out.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate droughts.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because they are boring.
*FlareChaser likes DeviantART
<GabeMoist> alexxm, we need a MLP x Cider Drinker PMV
<Cypresswolf> HatsuneMikuFan: I looked into the creative world :) now I just need to build something - not sure what yet
<Reikim> GilDash: I've heard of that. I think everyone's gotten it so far except maybe AJ and RD.
<alexxm> how about wenches and mead PMV GabeMoist
<GilDash> Om: Yeah. There's several episodes that are blank in my head until I re-watch them. Those that remain must obviously be my favourite. :D
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: Build your favorite pony
<GabeMoist> Cider Drinker would be better because there is a cider MLP episode
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i didn't get mah cheevo for doing a campaing with only meelee ._. haaax
<FlareChaser> I think I can officially say Nittany_Discord x ... x.... who is nittany shipped with again?
<alexxm> good point GabeMoist
<Reikim> GilDash: Or ones you hate. Can't forget that end of the spectrum.
<Om> GilDash: Yupers. And there arent to manny I cant recall
<Cypresswolf> I plan to start making designs via animal crossing and using those pixels to determine how big I want structures to be

<pony_9670> hey huguy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shipped with no-one officially. Will only accept Nittany_Discord x Shizuka.
<GilDash> Reikim: AJ had hers druing applebucking season, where she tried to live up to saying she'd clear the fields and failed. Dash's was more minor, where she basically freaks out during Sonic Rainboom.
<FlareChaser> ...are all the mods online?
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, so you're forever alone
<Reikim> GilDash: That's not loyalty, though.
<Cypresswolf> 3D sculptures seem too advanced for me at the moment :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist: I know.
<GilDash> Reikim: That's not her cutie mark. ;)
<HatsuneMikuFan> Cypresswolf: lol
<Reikim> GilDash: ...Damn, sorry, got things mixed up :P
<Om> I didn't like the MMMystery episode very much, too much hooves acting like hands and a part where the animators got lazy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of the girls I like are not interested in me (or are afraid to express interest).
<Reikim> Thank you, prince-lemon. Why is he a lemon, anyway?
*Wrek is keepign a watchful eye over bronystate.
<Cypresswolf> My brother Mike is studying to become an engineer, he could help me out in that, if I can get him into the game
<GilDash> Reikim: No shakes. :)
<prince-lemon> Because lemons are your God here.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, Forever alone? Better hook up with Saturn
<Cipher> 0,14Wrek is like a hawk
<Meanwhile> Surrender to the lemons.
<FlareChaser> All the girls I like are.... I dont like any girls or guys or other...I HATE EVERYONE :|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist: No.
<Reikim> ...I've been away too long. When did lemons ascend to divine status?
<teh|Spitfire> FlareChaser: :(
<Jaketehsnake> I know a Brony girls. She is in to me. Its great. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn is not a girl. So, no.
<Cypresswolf> are there any enemies in peaceful mode? I just want to explore the place today :)
<GabeMoist> lemons have always been at divine status
<FlareChaser> teh|Spitfire: lolnvm :3
<Invi> FlareChaser why? I mean i hate people too, but why do you hate them?
<Cipher> 0,14nope, Cypresswolf
<panda> GilDash: brb in a bit alright? ^^
<GabeMoist> but not for long
<GilDash> panda: Oh, okay. :D
<Cipher> 0,14no enemies in Peaceful
<FlareChaser> Invi: Oh, I dont hate Bronies and some other people... just a lot of people are douchebags nowadays..
<panda> Nittany_Discord: and if saturn was a girl... would you date her? XD
<GabeMoist> prince-lemon! You're reign of tyranny ends today!
<Cipher> 0,14*your
<Invi> FlareChaser welcome to my world ^^
<Cypresswolf> I've gotten lost a couple of time already - luckily I build my house tall on a hill so I can spot it from a disctance
<Reikim> FlareChaser: Kids. Kids are AWFUL today.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn is not a girl, so I don't need to worry about answering that question.
<FlareChaser> prince-lemon: say my name so I can get a 100 ping points.
<GabeMoist> and then my rebellion ended because of a typo
<fluttercry> 05,15So during this break I decided to play the impossible game and it's level packs. Beat them all...now what
<FlareChaser> Reikim: I know.
<panda> Nittany_Discord: XD aww
<Bromany> hey fellow bronies, i have a stupid question to ask :'( : Is there no stream at the moment or is it just me ? :(
<Reikim> fluttercry: beat it again?
<HatsuneMikuFan> fluttercry: Such a BOSS
<Reikim> Bromany: No stream.
<Invi> Reikim not my 3 cousins. they are awesome ^^
<Cipher> 0,14mfw there's a TV Tropes L4D drinking game

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still raining.
<Cypresswolf> There's a drinking game for everything - I got several that include my favorite movies :)
<Reikim> Invi: Okay, revision of statement: The majority of kids these days are awful, self-obsessed jerks, though there are exceptions and usually they grow out of it by age 18 or so.
<Reikim> Thanks, Cipher.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I still expect a random thunderclap or two.
<Cipher> 0,14Np
<Reikim> Now I've got something to do.
<Cypresswolf> Some are quite impossible to get through without getting blind drunk before the end
<Invi> Reikim right, but I'm not sure about that growing out of it....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And lightning.
<Om> Thunderclap reduced ma speed .0.
<Reikim> Invi: I say that for the sake of my own sanity. Because I could not take the world otherwise.

<Invi> no
<Kandarihu> In my opinion, this whole scootaloo = chicken has gone too far.
<GilDash> Om: 3 quickly will get me tipsy. You need about 6 in a night for me to be drunk. 8-12 I'm still capable. After that I begin to lose memory, so I can't guarantee anything. :D

<Reikim> FlareChaser: I don't understand. Filly Tavi and Filly Vinyl are d'awwww taken to the highest level.
<FlareChaser> Reikim: I dislike TavixVinyl, this has nothing to do with my shipping though, tis has valid reasons.
<RaveBrony> Dat Lulu
<RaveBrony> :$
*Lulu 07,01wonders if her Shizupet needs more training
<GilDash> Om: I wouldn't have said it if I hadn't. :D
<alexxm> what are they FlareChaser
<Om> GilDash: I suppose.
<GilDash> Om: It was in France. I was bored shitless. There was whisky. I had a fun night. :)
<Kandarihu> It's one of those many movies that I kept hearing nothing but good things about but hated every minute of it when I finally watched it... on Brony State.
<Reikim> Shizuka is a pet now? O.O I always thought those stories about locking her in the code room were just rumours...
<RaveBrony> :o
<Om> GilDash: Sounds like it.
<alexxm> why didn't you like it Kandarihu
<Shizuka> 13after this i'm voluntarily going to the code room so redesign a site of mine
<FlareChaser> alexxm: one likes.. I dunno dubstep and the other likes classical, two very different things, and I would figure that the two would be the complete opposite.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01brushes Lulu

<RaveBrony> o.o
*Lulu 07,01is brushed
<Jaketehsnake> Fuck, I just checked my steam'
<Reikim> FlareChaser: I dislike the common perception that Vinyl only does dubstep. In my opinion, she is well-versed in all things electronic.
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: nothing
<RaveBrony> Hey SparklyWaffles :P
<Invi> dat valve
<RaveBrony> Oh, ok
<Darf14> oh L4D2
<PinkiePry> Hey everypony. :)

<RaveBrony> Yeah :D
<Om> GilDash: :D I can imagine how much fun you had
<RaveBrony> Hiya PinkiePry :$
<Reikim> FlareChaser: And I can tell you right now that electronic and classical go together VERY well.
<GilDash> Om: Worst thing? It was a family holiday. :D
<Darkts3> oh Nittany is playing again
<alexxm> hey PinkiePry hows your day been
<SparklyWaffles> Has anyone went to the BronyCon Q&A Livestream?
<FlareChaser> Reikim: .....no :|
*RaveBrony likes both techno and classical :)
<SparklyWaffles> Just 'bout to end :P
<Om> GilDash: And you were bored.
<Bromany> hi there, pinkiePry
<Kandarihu> The protagonist was nothing but a jerk. And the portrayal of the principal made HIM out to be a villain. As if skipping school like this was somehow a noble thing.
*FlareChaser no :|
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi PinkiePry
<Darkts3> =/ interesting mod
<Buytoast> Kandarihu, Ferris Wheeler?
<Darf14> ..... ok how did you put ponies there, teach me
<Reikim> FlareChaser: Yes. If it's done right, it can work incredibly well. And I very much enjoy both genres.
<RaveBrony> Im listening to some Mozart right now O.o
<GilDash> Om: *Very* bored. THere was *nothing* to do. :D
<Kandarihu> Ferris Beuller
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Our next matchup is...
<Buytoast> oh boy
<fluttercry> 05,15Kandarihu the movie wasn't about Ferris. It was about how his actions made Cameron and everyone around him grow
<Jaketehsnake> CMON KIRZ! I NEED TO PLAY!
<Reikim> FlareChaser: Or if nto classical then orchestral at least, if you like your definitions kept straight.
<Kandarihu> Really? Okay.
<Om> GilDash: Even so, I am sure you could have found something better to do than getting besotted. Then agian what do I know.

<Jaketehsnake> B-b-b-b-ut kirzstryfe... You said one more round till the final game...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01kirzstryfe: You don't want to do a third round with random viewers?
<Invi> Woodenfan mods vs viewers L4D2
<Shamroc> Jaketehsnake...time restricitons for one of the members
<Jaketehsnake> Shamroc, Ah. Carry on then
<GilDash> Om: There was *nothing* interesting for about 20 miles. The only thing we did expect for playing cards and badminton was go on a 4 hour canal cruise, which was also boring as sin, and extremely hot. :D
<Buytoast> it's time to kill that what done doing has to for the good times opf them who are doing
<Reikim> We should do this again sometime, only with TF2 instead of L4D2. Mostly because I actually have that game >.>
<Buytoast> today
<Om> GilDash: I just don't get the drinking mentality, I blame america
<Buytoast> a 4 hour anal cruise?
<Onyxia> Message from bronysith : dont ping him coz he wont be able to answer
<Reikim> Om: I blame God, culture, society, and my dead cat.
<alexxm> how come Onyxia
<HatsuneMikuFan> Will this mod vs viewers happen more often or when the mods will be free on that day/
<HatsuneMikuFan> ?
<GilDash> Om: I actually don't have that mentality. I like a couple just to unwind around a crowd, but if I have much more then I just keep going. :D
<Om> Reikim: Those work to, I might blame those later.
<Shamroc> btw users are gonna win this ;p

<GilDash> Airpuff: I think you're confused about what I do here. ;)
<Ponies47> But anyways. I really don't do (squee) with them. I just sat in a room on a computer with my brother who was also useing a computer. He was playing games on the computer. While I watched ponies! He stayed and listened! :O I watched Party of One, Swarm of the Century, Super Pony Beat 1-3, A (squee) load of MLP FIM Youtube poops and Apple.Mov. I was gonna show him the other's but then he walked out on me :(

<CupcakeWarrior> Whose voices are those?
<Kosoveon> still need to see that one
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ride that horde!
<Everlasting_Joy> I wish I could have caught the L4D2 stream. I had to run a long errand.
<GilDash> Om: You're just afraid you're a silly filly. :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was a good stream.
<|Discord|> I sure had fun playing lolz
<Om> GilDash: I know I am silly, but that would be getting off topic
<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: Oh sure, rub it in my face why don'tcha ;).
<GilDash> Om: I dissent again. :)
<Ponies47> I also showed him Winter Wrap up and Smile. Smile, Smile. I thought Smile, Smile, Smile would get him. :( He has listened to 3 episodes now. Ya'll would think he would of caved in by now :(
<Cipher> 0,14well, I'm off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everlasting_Joy: Dunno. Getting beat twice?

<drf|laptop> 03I found ana ctual use for Chrome
<Om> GilDash: Its a odd feat to behold
<drf|laptop> 03http://bd-hell.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-remove-facebook-timeline-and.html
<Ponies47> Well he really wasen't paying attention to it. Maybe if he took a closer listen maybe he woyld like :) I should him A Friend in Deed
<drf|laptop> 03can't find a Firefox equivalent
<drf|laptop> 03and EW TIMELINE
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> > People complaining abotu stuff not being on Chrome
<SayWhat> Ponies47: Worng episode. lul
<HyperMetalLugia> > Chrome has something really useful that isn't on Firefox
<HyperMetalLugia> U mad web?
*Irish_Pony cleans his M16
<drf|laptop> 03well
<nickstr> that is only just ONE thing
<drf|laptop> 03because Chrome isn't open source, I can't find a way to download the extension as a file and edit it
<RaveBrony> Finally! After hours of work, my OC isss!!!....... at 5% completion....
<RaveBrony> x_x
<SayWhat> Nice!
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, chromium
<drf|laptop> 03FF has .xpi files, and you can download them in like any browser
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Ponies47> SayWhat: He has listened to 3 episodes by now. You would think he would cave in by now :'(
<drf|laptop> 03can you get that extension as a file for me?
<CupcakeWarrior> I think I should get this game
<GilDash> Om: Want to come for a closer look? ;)
<HyperMetalLugia> I remember doing that
<CupcakeWarrior> ...
<HyperMetalLugia> .crx
<HyperMetalLugia> okay
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Om> GilDash: You could see it for miles, don't want to get crushed.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03it's odd
<SayWhat> Ponies47: The bravery is strong in this one...
<drf|laptop> 03apparently Timeline doesn't pwork on IE6 or 7, so people were saying to use a user-agent switcher
<CupcakeWarrior> 2 EQD updates in 5 minutes
<drf|laptop> 03but I tried IE6 on a XP machine, and it had timeline even though it was begging me to update
<SayWhat> Ponies47: Or he's dug too far deep into Narnia, if ya catch my drift
<GilDash> Om: Don't be shy now, you're obviously interested. ;)
<nickstr> Microsoft is begging to give Internet Explorer a second chance
<nickstr> through ads now
<drf|laptop> 03let's try like IE4 or whatever Windows 98 has :P
*Irish_Pony pushes Om to GilDash
<Om> GilDash: Afraid and terified I would say
<CupcakeWarrior> What the crap is going on? 0_0
<superretroworld> Ponies47: theres one suggestion, talk to him, maybe theres something bothering him to prevent him from watching the show
<Bronysith> quick question
<Bronysith> is it weird that i want to be tested on
<Bronysith> like drug wise
<Ponies47> I wonder if he does like the show but is scared to tell me. I think he's probley in stage 4. He is watching the show 1 part is enjoying it while the other is saying it's wrong :(
<Om> Wii shit, next inovation
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Well, it pays.
<Bluestrom_S> I love this drawing, I also have the same nerf gun http://ninjapony.deviantart.com/art/Nerf-Luna-304627436
<SayWhat> Ponies47: See now, you can't stuff it down his thoat, let it ease in
<GilDash> Om: Do I have to let you borrow my sense of adventure? ;)
<Bronysith> oh shit Everlasting_Joy is here.... my cousin failed the airstrike lol jk
<superretroworld> SayWhat: agreed
<Om> GilDash: I don't think that is possible.
<Ponies47> SayWhat: I think I should back off for a while and see if he'll come to me :(
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: seroiusly praise is nice and shit. but the constructive crits help me better
<CupcakeWarrior> Does this game ever end or does it just go until you lose?
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Muahahaha! Your cousin hasn't gotten back yet I see. . . He hasn't told you my terrible secret.
<GilDash> Om: I'd be willing to give it a shot. ;)
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: In other words, you're happy?
<SayWhat> Ponies47: Yeah, don't bring it up unless absolutely necissary, or if he brings it up
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: ya. you showed me the flaws
<Iheartponi> 10 pm EST|7 pm PST.
<Om> GilDash: I'm not willing to let you try, that fat head of yours would eat me.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: i wasnt trying to be the next tolkien in terms of great writing
<Bronysith> thattl be in the book im writing
<Ponies47> SayWhat: True. Maybe I should talk to him and ask him why he hatesm it so much.
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Just because you aren't going to be the next Tolkien doesn't mean you can't improve your writing.
<Bronysith> fanfic is just for practice
<GilDash> Om: Are you calling me fat now? :|
<Ponies47> *hates
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: i know but this fanfics are for practice really
<SayWhat> oi
<Om> GilDash: Is that a problem?
<HyperMetalLugia> http://layouts-skins.com/layouts/fb_timeline_disabler.crx < try this
<Bronysith> Sumica: one does not simply get support
<superretroworld> Note: never force someone to become a brony, thou thy must learn for themselves
*GilDash kisses Om.
<GilDash> Om: I don't know, Omffee. Is it? ;)
<Mutterguy> dawwww
<FillyFlam> >Implying people need to be forced.
<HyperMetalLugia> http://blazomania.com/wp-content/uploads/TimelineRemove/TimeLineRemove.crx < or this
<CupcakeWarrior> I love how Sumi's voice is louder
<Om> I'm goiung to do my part in less RP by ignoring that GilDash
<Bronysith> you must become a brony by choice
<SayWhat> huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue
<Bronysith> a brony chooses. a slave obeys
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<HyperMetalLugia> not sure which is the real as the download for the actual crx is too fast for me to copy paste away before it gets deleted
<SayWhat> OBEY ME!
<drf|laptop> 03is there a way to edit those?
<drf|laptop> 03just see how they work etc
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: And heck, I didn't address all the flaws, there might have been some I don't even know about.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: okay lets stop there
<Bronysith> new discussion
<GilDash> Om: Tsk, you're such a suck up. ;)
<Bronysith> PIE
<pikorar> Hi everybody!
<Bronysith> hiya pikorar
<CupcakeWarrior> Hi pikorar
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Fair enough.
<HyperMetalLugia> just use 7zip
<superretroworld> FillyFlam: forceing someone to watch mlp is considered a brony nazi in the urdandictionary
<HyperMetalLugia> I swear they're just zip files
<GilDash> pikorar: I'm totally asleep! :D
<Om> GilDash: Thats how I got though school
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: I wasn't even going to start another critique, I was just noting.
<Ponies47> My bro has listened to 3 episodes now. He still doesn't like. or does he like it?
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: but yes. i am going to write a book later on in life. when i learn better writing techniques
<GilDash> Om: You need to lighten up more. ;)
<superretroworld> hey pikorar
<SayWhat> Why does this game remind me of Jimmy Neutron
<pikorar> I can see that, GilDash, which is why you're totally not on right now and I miss you.
<Bronysith> SayWhat: graphics
<Om> GilDash: I turned on my lamp. Happy.
<Ponies47> Hey pikorar
<GilDash> pikorar: I'm glad that you understand that and obviously can't read what I've written right now. :D
<SayWhat> Bronysith: I don't know... It's something about the characters :P
<pikorar> Hi everyone.
<SayWhat> Hi pikorar
<pikorar> Yeah, GilDash, I wish I could've read it, but I can't.
<GilDash> Om: I was thinking of something else to turn on... ;)
<pikorar> A light, GilDash?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: however here is Alexx's pony and human forms http://valornomad.deviantart.com/art/Request-Darth-Stal-Alexx-304518284 http://jennidash.deviantart.com/art/Use-the-Force-304227938
<GilDash> pikorar: That's a shame, isn't it? You know, if you could read this.
<pikorar> Ooh, ooh! Is it an iPad, GilDash! It's an iPad!
<drf|laptop> 03brb reboot
<pikorar> I am just too smart for my own safety...
<Ponies47> I'm happy and sad. I'm happy because this is my last week of school :) I'm sad because I can't make my bro a brony :(
<Straisin> I know that feel bro
<Straisin> btw, hey guys
<Bronysith> Ponies47: u cant make anyone a brony
<pikorar> Don't worry about your bro, bro.
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Thank you :). Believe it or not, I have a hard time picturing people in books, so seeing a picture, especially from the artist, helps.
<Bronysith> Straisin: hi
<pikorar> Hi Straisin, I love you!
<Mutterguy> I ipad for chat is not all that, for the lack of Tab is quite bad </Zecora>
<Straisin> pikorar: <3
<Everlasting_Joy> No no no, if you're going to pitch something, you have to do it as Billy Mays.
<Om> GilDash: How bout... no. And if that wasn't clear. No way in hell
<Straisin> I managed to introduce the show to ONE friend
<superretroworld> Ponies47: some reasons he may not like the show is because hes either a closet brony or he may have problems in the outside world to prevent him from liking it
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: yea. Jennidash did the pony. and valoreins from bronystate made the human form
<SayWhat> I have afriend in denial, he said he'd concider if I can get my friend to play LoL, but he'l only play LoL if I play Battlefield with him
<pikorar> I introduced to show to 3 friends, and have 8 brony friends IRL.
<GilDash> Om: I was under the distinct impression it was my kind of hell. ;)
<Ponies47> Bronysith: True. But the thing is he has listened to 3 episodes and a bunch of other pony stuff
<Straisin> just don't force it on them and they kinda start to soften up, in my case anyways
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: i like how young the human form works. he is 19 after all
<Bronysith> Ponies47: ooh. yea hes a brony
<Om> GilDash: That's the extra cranium you are packing speaking.
<Bronysith> Sumica: harpoon ftw
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: What do you mean by that?
<GilDash> pikorar: Clever ponies will be ignored when it is convenient. :D
<pikorar> No, really, don't push it. If he hasn't accepted it by this point then he just doesn't want to be a brony.
<Straisin> Ponies47: I think that makes him a brony by definition lol
<Straisin> btw, what game is wrek playing?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: what? alexx is 19 and 20 in my fanfic lol.
<pikorar> I think he's playing The Game.
<Straisin> D:
<Bronysith> pikorar: u lost
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Umm. . . never mind.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: okey dokey lokey mokey kokey smokey
<Mutterguy> F*** you Bronysith
<Straisin> kinda looks like sanctum?
<Bronysith> Mutterguy: wat?
<Straisin> well, the gameplay anyways
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: :D
<Ponies47> superretroworld: I sort of think he's a brony. But he's upset about it :(
<GilDash> Om: Aw, come on. I'm just the kind of pony you need to warm up to. ;)
*Mutterguy lost too
<Firaga> would anyone like to add me on steam?, i mostly play team fortress on weekdays (whenever i get to use my sis comp) so anyone?
<pikorar> Just go on Google and type in "What game is Wrek playing right now?" because Google knows everything. EVERYTHING.
*Biglaw warms up to GilDash
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: is it worse then the prequels?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: that is all i need to know
<Bronysith> hiya Biglaw
<Biglaw> Hiya Bronysith
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Oh lord no, see, this wasn't trying to destroy anything.
<superretroworld> Ponies47: maybe because he doesnt want his parents or even you to know
*Irish_Pony pulls Biglaw back away from GilDash "Dont ruin this for Om..."
<superretroworld> pikorar: :D
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: okay good. that was my goal. to not suck
<DrPug> my friend called me a fag cuz i like mlp :c
<Om> GilDash: I don't think you are.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: as bad as the prequels
<Straisin> my brother gives me shit for it :/
<Straisin> but meh
<Bronysith> DrPug: all of my rage
<GilDash> Om: Of course I am! Who else is as kind and caring as I am? ;)
<Biglaw> DrPug everypony has their opninion, and you most certainly arent a ***
<Bronysith> DrPug: how dare he say that word
<Om> Irish_Pony: Why are you suppoting this >.>
<Ponies47> Bronysith: I think he is. Like I said he listend to a (squee) load of pony stuff today because we where both sitting in the same room and I had the computer. :)
<CupcakeWarrior> I have friends that hate the fact that I am a brony, but they still like me
<Bronysith> okay den Ponies47
<Om> GilDash: A lot of people, none of which are so persistant!
<pikorar> Me too CupcakeWarrior.
<Biglaw> At least one of my friends doesn't mind I'm a brony.
<Wrek> 05THIS IS A GREAT SONG
<Biglaw> :p
<Irish_Pony> Om just stip resisting...she just loves fighters...it makes her victory that much sweeter...;)
<Bronysith> Wrek: true
<GilDash> Om: It's only because I care, Omffee. :)
<pikorar> But I can't complain because I still have 8 brony friends. Swag.
<SayWhat> I havea friend that would probably beat my family if they found out I was a brony, but not me ;) We're good friends
<Straisin> I need to have pony/gaming marathons when I get to summer vacation
<Firaga> Ponies47: dont try to force him to watch them, it never works
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Guess I'll have to find out the truth. :|
<Biglaw> Hey Wrek! I'm listening to eBay by weird al!
<Straisin> Firaga: this*
<GilDash> pikorar: You're like a strutting peacock. ;)
<Bronysith> Biglaw: wtf
<Om> Irish_Pony: I think you have some typos
<Bronysith> Wrek: u getting dark souls when it releases on pc?
<Ponies47> Firaga: I know. He listened to so much pony today I thought he would cave in :(
<superretroworld> pikorar: lucky, none of my friends are bronies, but one of them did mention derpy
<Biglaw> Bronysith whaat? It's a good song!
<CupcakeWarrior> I have 3 brony friends, but one of them moved away :(
<Biglaw> CupcakeWarrior everypony will go their own way
<Bronysith> CupcakeWarrior: hugs?
<Om> GilDash: I'm sure you do, as to what you care for. I am uncertain.
<Irish_Pony> Om 1. You get the idea 2. IM DRUNK! YOU DONT HAVE AN EXCUSE!
*CupcakeWarrior hugs Bronysith
*Bronysith hugs CupcakeWarrior
<pikorar> I like that simile, GilDash. Makes me feel beautiful. But yeah, I'm just emanating swag right now, my ego is as huge as... I'm not good with similes but it's pretty big.
<SayWhat> They sound like nerds, but then again, I sound like a nerd when video games are involved
<Om> Irish_Pony: Fair enough -_-
<Ponies47> There's one other brony at my school and 2 pegasisters. But none of them like to talk to me :'(
<Everlasting_Joy> SayWhat: The better question is, what is wrong with that?
<GilDash> Om: Everypony, Omffee. Especially the stubborn ones. :)
<GilDash> pikorar: Maybe I'll have to crash you to the ground. ;)
<nickstr> ouch
<SayWhat> Everlasting_Joy: Nothing, I find it amusing when normal people don't know what the hell I'm talking about. ;)
<Om> GilDash: You are the stubborn one.
<Bronysith> AAAAAAAAAAH
<nickstr> I never thought I would hear an ad with out of phase stereo
<Everlasting_Joy> SayWhat: :D
<CupcakeWarrior> I do bring my pony toys to school with me though
<nickstr> it literally hurts
<Bronysith> are they going to stream old dr who in the summer?
<pikorar> Peacocks can't fly GilDash.
<GilDash> Om: Immovable object meets irristable force. What a predicament. ;)
<Bronysith> pikorar: the ones i make can
<Ponies47> I have no pony stuff :( I need to get some :(
<SayWhat> Me too :(
<Straisin> Ponies47: huh, I didn't know bronies would be the ones to ostracise, but there's jerks in every fandom I guess
<Firaga> out of all the 6 people in my school i know are bronies, 1 is me of course, 3 of them have been my best friends since grade school, and the other two are batshit insane, so i keep my distance from them
<GilDash> pikorar: No, but they're pretty damned pretty. ;)
<flutter_spin> DD right?
<CupcakeWarrior> Yep
<pikorar> I don't, but that's because I'm not obsesive and I don't want to give into the corporate part of Hasbro and MLP.
<Straisin> Firaga: how so?
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: hiya
<Bronysith> WELCOME to the herd AllisZero
<flutter_spin> hi guys!
<Straisin> heya flutter
<Om> GilDash: I don't think the phrase uses irrisistable
<pikorar> Hi flutterspin_spin! I love you!
<flutter_spin> woot!
<GilDash> Om: Shame. I did. :)
*pikorar flaunts his feathers at GilDash. "I hope you like what you see."
<flutter_spin> watching Wrek eh?
<Om> GilDash: Must be your big head messing things up again.
<Straisin> finals in 2 hours? NOPE, PONIES
<Bronysith> Biglaw: when is ur next chapter?
*CupcakeWarrior glomps pikorar
<pikorar> PONIES!?
<GilDash> pikorar: I think you should know that by now. ;)
<Straisin> PONIES!
<pikorar> Where!?

<Om> GilDash: I am perfectly content with that.
<Ponies47> Straisin: I think he is one but he's to scared to tell me. I was the same when I first became one. Anthor brony convinced me to come outta my shell and now everybody in my family accpect for dad knows I'm a brony.

<pikorar> Speaking of ponies, today I had to drive through the neighborhood where I'm going to be living in a few months to check out the progress on the house and there are like 8 or so friggan ponies just walking along the roads, and people everywhere just gawking at them, and I had to maneuvre around them at like 5 MPH, and I couldn't honk my horn at all... Pfft, ponies.
<Straisin> Ponies47: you kinda learn to stop giving a crap as time passes
<Straisin> lol piko
<pikorar> Real life ponies suck. :C

<Bronysith> SayWhat: i cant tell my dad im a brony... hes a republican
<Firaga> Bronysith: wut?
<Bronysith> Firaga: nothing
<Ponies47> EVERYPONY IS PROUD TO BE A BRONY! FOR THAT YOU GET A BROHOOF! :)/)
<SayWhat> Bronysith, as is mine
<GilDash> Om: Nope. You'll learn one day. ;)
<Bronysith> Ponies47: /)
<Iheartponi> 21 hrs and 48 minutes until RS.
<Om> GilDash: But not one day soon.
<GilDash> superretroworld: Ah, no. :D
<pikorar> My dad found out I'm a brony a few months ago and surprisingly enough, he didn't care and simply said "yeah, My Little Pony was pretty popular when I was young." I was pleasently surprised.
<Bronysith> I HATE POLITICS!!!!!
<superretroworld> Ponies47: /)
<GilDash> Om: I've got all the time in the world. ;)
<SayWhat> Bronysith: But he wrestles, so I can play the "wrestling" card.
<Om> GilDash: But whyyeeee
<superretroworld> Bronysith: then you hate obama?
<GilDash> Om: Why not? ;)
<pikorar> ...
<Bronysith> superretroworld: anything politics related
<Straisin> no, he hates politics lol
<Bronysith> superretroworld: i hate it
<Bronysith> superretroworld: so eys
<pikorar> He hates TALKING about politics.
<Om> GilDash: I'm not worth eeet
<GilDash> pikorar: Doesn't everypony? :D
<pikorar> Not my mom.
<Firaga> someone derail the chat before we get all political
<GilDash> Om: I refuse to believe that. :)
<Ponies47> I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON and think. *Goes to THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON*
<GilDash> Firaga: I can work on that. :D
<Straisin> obama is pretty kewl, donates stuff and doesn't afraid of anything
<superretroworld> i dont mind politics, but i cant stand learning it, fucking civics
<SayWhat> Well Scarecrow, you do an awful lot of talking for someone without a brain! Well a lot of people do a lot of talking without brains! *points to congress*
<Bronysith> Straisin: where does he get the money to donate?
<Om> GilDash: That is the propper use of dissent
<pikorar> And Obama supposedly supports gays. I can't hate on that.
<GilDash> pikorar: Not sure if should make a mom joke... :D
<Ponies47> *Comes back to earth* I've got nothing. :(
<pikorar> MY MOM!
<Bronysith> pikorar: he probably just said that to get more votes on the next election
<Straisin> Straisin: let me rephrase that, ran a charity and doesn't afraid of anything
*CupcakeWarrior noms pikorar's mom
<SayWhat> But that's not gonna give him many more votes because 90% of gays already vote democratic.
<GilDash> Om: See, we can teach each other. ;)
<pikorar> He's not going to win, I can already see that.
<pikorar> CupcakeWarrior, that's slightly suggestive, but I lol'd.
<Om> GilDash: I retract my previous stantement.
<GilDash> Om: Too late. ;)
<Straisin> Bronysith: let me rephrase that, ran a charity and doesn't afraid of anything. derp
<Bronysith> FUCK REPUBLICANS AND FUCK DEMOCRATS AND ESPECIIALY fuck politics in general
<SayWhat> I'm a Libertarian.
<pikorar> What's a stantement? Is that a brand of potatochip?
<Firaga> at least politics in the us arent as fucked up as they are here in mexico
<pikorar> I'm independant!
<Bronysith> Straisin: but where did he get the money? from taxes that hte people pay
<CupcakeWarrior> Does this game ever end?
<GilDash> pikorar: That's because politics is about the face and not the policies... No, I will not discuss politics! :D
<SayWhat> I'm socially liberal but economically republican
<Straisin> from the people who donate to charities lol
<Straisin> I'm talking about before his presidency
<superretroworld> poor Bronysith :D
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_> why are you talking politics...
<SayWhat> The only one that makes sense -_-
<Ponies47> You know I think my bro is a brony. Because while he was listening to all the pony stuff he did laugh a couple of times. hmmmmm?
<flutter_spin> 21 views. That's it from my fanfic. I don't know what to think about that.
<SayWhat> BECAUSE WE LIKE TO RAMBLE
<Bronysith> Sumica: ALL OF THE DISTRACTIONS
<Om> GilDash: Its never to late!
<pikorar> I have some non-brony friends who still like some brony things, like the .MOV videos.
<GilDash> Om: Omffee, yes it is. ;)
<SayWhat> Everyone liikes the .MOVs
<pikorar> But those are fun for the whole family!
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2961/
<GilDash> pikorar: MOV for the family? Yeah, maybe not. :D
<flutter_spin> Maybe its too long. 20k words is a lot :P
<Om> GilDash: Damn
<pikorar> FAMILY.MOV
<Midnight_Tempest> yay... my Demon Hunter is lvl 26 now and i just finished act 2... suck it Belial
<Ponies47> I showed my bro Apple.Mov the only thing he liked was how Jappleack said (Squee) YOU I CAN ALL THESE APPLES!
<SayWhat> pikorar: I showed a person a .MOV and he didn't even know what MLP was. He then asked what it's from and watches waiting for blood and shit
<GilDash> Om: I'm not building a damn for you. ;)
<Ponies47> So he says :|

<PartyCannon> dat reset
<Luna_of_Assassins> then apple pie could be made from two ponies

<WallDives> PartyCannon: the entire MOTHER series was weird.
<Meanwhile> True. Pinkie can spawn additional Pinkie's from her mane.
<Firaga> WallDives: refrain from spoilers please,i still need to beat mother3
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile: How about Apple Jack giving birth to a filly and Pinkie Pie giving birth to a colt?
*Luna_of_Assassins summons darkspawn
<WallDives> Firaga: wasnt going to anyway.

<Ponies47> *Clones himself*
<MahBoi777> need moar red coins!
*Luna_of_Assassins summons shadowspawn
<PartyCannon> CupcakeWarrior we know she can bud additional hooves, so that doesn't surprise me
<Ponies47> NOW THERE'S 2 OF ME :)
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Not as amusing.
<CupcakeWarrior> Of course, we dont need any more Pinkies
<Petrified_Discord> Pinkie would just curbstomp somepony and an instat clone would shoot out. Those that survive the fall will carry on her legacy.
<Meanwhile> For a start, that way actually makes sense without magic.
<Meanwhile> And where's the fun in that.
<Luna_of_Assassins> I need a parallel version of myself from a R63 universe

<Darf14> wow, very long intro for a SNES game .....ok that and final fantasy but that game had a good reason
<OneTrickPony> Tink=navi

<SteveCharb> gnight ingwaz
<Meanwhile> Night ingwaz
<Firaga> SB sure has a weird collection of games
<CupcakeWarrior> Isnt Peter Pan Robin Williams? Because that looks nothing like him
<SteveCharb> CupcakeWarrior: I was just pondering that
<Darf14> The game skipped 2/3 of the movie, it might be a short game :)
<Meanwhile> Stop saying that it doesn't look like Robin Williams!
<MahBoi777> awesome collection, I never knew any of these games existed lol
<Meanwhile> It's a goddamn sprite!
<ingwaz> CupcakeWarrior: your mom is robin williams
<Firaga> robin williams was too busy at the time playing A link to the past, true story
<CupcakeWarrior> eww
<ingwaz> which makes things pretty awkward
<TheRainbowDash> Meanwhile: He is not funny though, not him.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3how can you say it doesn't look like Robin Williams?
<flutter_spin> LOL! $3000 donate to the brony project and Lauren Faust will draw your OC
<CupcakeWarrior> Firaga: He named his kid Zelda
<kirzstryfe> 1,3that green spandex matches exactly :3
<Meanwhile> Inb4 2d joke.
<MahBoi777> GO ROBIN!
<SteveCharb> CupcakeWarrior: I think that they made the game before the movie was released, with little interaction between the studios
<Firaga> so not even the bad guys die in this game
<MahBoi777> BEES
<Derpy_Hooves> flutter_spin: someone actually donated $10,000
<CupcakeWarrior> ded
<flutter_spin> I saw that.
<SteveCharb> which is what they used to do when license games weren't automatically terrible
<flutter_spin> that's insane
<DeathStar> kirzstryfe: with that logic your text looks like robin williams
<Derpy_Hooves> which is stupid
<ingwaz> Derpy_Hooves: two people donated 10k
<Derpy_Hooves> again
<Derpy_Hooves> which is stupid
<Meanwhile> Und then kirz was Robin Williams.
<Firaga> SteveCharb: there were some terible licensed games back then
<Firaga> SteveCharb: hell even on the NES
<flutter_spin> Someone has a lot of money on their hands
<ingwaz> Derpy_Hooves: its their money, theyre free to do with it as they please. its funding a documentary so its possible thaty have other motives behind just being a brony to do it
<Pan> 1,3all I have to do is ~believe~
<ingwaz> other motives besides*
<Meanwhile> God damn fat kid.
<MahBoi777> oh shet, he's rollin
<CupcakeWarrior> :(
<TheRainbowDash> Pan: No way, you're not him.
<SteveCharb> Firaga: yeah I know, but there were some legit good ones
<CupcakeWarrior> dat fanfare
<MahBoi777> rolling fat people are unstoppable
*Pan throws colored pudding at TheRainbowDash
<flutter_spin> I remember watching an episode where some guy buys a rare bottle for $20,000 ... . .. because he thought it would be fun to have
<TheRainbowDash> Huh? Now there is rain?
<CupcakeWarrior> MahBoi777! Use rollout!
<Meanwhile> Someone needs to gif his walk animation into a "Haters gonna Hate" pic.
<MahBoi777> :D
<flutter_spin> He had NO clue what it was
<TheRainbowDash> This feels like a Minecraft world now.
<Firaga> two hits and thats it? man Robin williams is getting old for this crap
<SteveCharb> Meanwhile: I'll see if I can find the spritesheet
<Meanwhile> I believe in you kirzstryfe.
<ingwaz> Firaga: he is old and fat now, and i dont think peter pan ever actually got hit in the movies
*CupcakeWarrior flies
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: and i belive in the you that belives in kirzstryfe
<MahBoi777> don stop believin or you'll fall lol
<Derpy_Hooves> funny thing is
<Darf14> Pan Moves very slow, I guess his age made him slow
<Dark92Enigma> RAIN???? I hope it's not chocolate rain (not that i dislike chocolate)
<Derpy_Hooves> most of the guys probably sdaw the reward and were all like "OH MY GOD I MUST HAVE", donated, and were all like, "oh yeah im awesome" and when the time comes their email will say "your donation to X has been rejected due to insufficient funds, have a nice day retard"
<kirzstryfe> 1,3know a pain in the ass game? Beethoven for Dos

<ingwaz> Derpy_Hooves: wrong, the original 10k donator has already been contacted in order to make sure that it was a legit donation and he is serious about it. it sounds like you're horribly misinformed and just spouting stuff for no apparent reason
*twilight_sprinkler moves away from the mic to check for cops

*CupcakeWarrior noms TheRainbowDash
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkler: she can use her magic to deflect the beam
<ingwaz> Derpy_Hooves: don't make baseless statements about something that already has backing and i wont have to disagree with you. to my knowledge, committing to the kickstarter requires that there is sufficient funds in your account at the time otherwise it rejects it. you're allowed to have your own opinions, however, just as you can state yours, i will state mine as well
<SuperBrony64> 11,02TROLL LIFE

<Darf14> AVGN should play it

<ingwaz> SteveCharb: i was planning on it, but i'm not one to leave a discussion behind when i believe someone is in the wrong. plus, its not really that i'm actually tired, just that this is the normal time that i go to sleep, so i should keep my schedule regulated
<Darf14> The company that Published Fallout published this? ...... wow they sure came a long way
<CupcakeWarrior> His head is huge

<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: whats the fic about anyway. it has something to do with particle accelerators?
<TheRainbowDash> Dark92Enigma: What?
<Cypresswolf> TheRainbowDash: the 90's were full of weird games

<Dark92Enigma> Oh, i see.......so he's streaming TheRainbowDash ?
<Firaga> i gave up on fanfiction a looooong time ago, ahhh good times
<flutter_spin> ugh. It is well written.
<TheRainbowDash> Dark92Enigma: Ugh, nevermind.
<ingwaz> Derpy_Hooves: thats your choice. my disagreeing with you is not the same as attacking you. if you see any form of disagreement that way, thats a bit silly really. but don't state opinions which have no backing and not expect no disagreement at all either
<TheRainbowDash> Cypresswolf: Oh, cool that you have them old games.
<Kandarihu> Do you have Plok?

<Shamroc> Shizuka: i wish i understood what you were talking about...
<Cypresswolf> Entire Ninja Gaiden series - never beat a single one :P
<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka: If we watch it, we will know what you look like 0_0
<Shizuka> 13obviously shamroc needs to brush up on his great wheel cosmology
<Saturn> 08,01you're now a hat
<flutter_spin> Yep, 49 separate editing passes on chapter 2? what the crap? I did like 6 and I died.... of boredom
<Darf14> err..... whats going on? Im so confused
<Kencolt> This is a very very very odd platformer.
<Shamroc> Shizuka: my what>
<Shamroc> DED
<Meanwhile> Shizuka's face is like the silence from Dr Who. You forget you saw her once you stop looking.
<PartyCannon> lol
<Saturn> 08,01i wish i could draw; i'd draw shizu as a hat
<Firaga> oh god same music
<ingwaz> BRAVO
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<drf|laptop> 03from where?
<Saturn> 08,01i'd draw a group pic of all the mods as clothing and accessories
<Shizuka> 13i don't actually exist
<Shizuka> 13you are all hallucinating
<Shamroc> but really Shizuka what are you talking about..
<Saturn> 08,01it's probably a good thing that i can't draw.
<Darf14> Wow, Jeremys yard is Hazardous to animals and probably People
<CupcakeWarrior> SB would be a shirt
<ingwaz> Shizuka: thats nothing new
<Om> Thank goodness.
<CupcakeWarrior> I thought Shizu was a robot
<XAX|ipod> Saturn: I'm sure you'd draw the weirdest shit and make millions off it if you could.
<junh1024-XD> actually, it might be more useful to watch the spice girls wembely 1998? concert
<Saturn> 08,01i would shizubot
<Firaga> and then that cow exploded
<Ponies47> *explodes*
<Cypresswolf> I remember we have at least 3 NES console, they kept breaking down
<Saturn> 08,01er
<SteveCharb> I wish I could draw, saturn, I have so many great ideas,
<Saturn> 08,01minus the "i would"
<DeathStar> Saturn: i wish i new what all the mods looked like so i could draw that for you!
<Meanwhile> Shizuka is actually a pan-dimensional being who's true form is not comprehendable to the human mind, so she chooses to appear as a user in an inconspicuous chat room.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the Shizuka is a series of code that compiled itself on a server in the northern US
<ingwaz> i'm not nearly drunk enough for this game...
<Ponies47> Am I a cow? NO I'M NOT A PONY! :P
<Shamroc> aww
<drf|laptop> 03LOL these news people
<Meanwhile> Dat flop.

<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Firaga> is it some sort of duel monster?
<Vinyer> pokemon tournaments
<Saturn> 08,01a quine of code.
<CupcakeWarrior> Maybe Shizuka is Asuka in disguise
<Meanwhile> Quine sounds like a fruit found at the edge of the world.
<Darf14> The overworld is odd
<Shizuka> 13baka na..
<flutter_spin> is it wrong for me to view fanfics just to see people's comments of how bad they are?
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: yes please, with ice
<Firaga> flutter_spin: i do that all the time
<SteveCharb> Meanwhile: I'll have a Quine smoothie please
<Darf14> I do it as well, so dont feel bad
<flutter_spin> It sort of makes me feel better of my fanfic not being seen
<Cypresswolf> Bugs Bunny Birthday Bash my brother Mike & me played alot - it wasnt terrible, but really long
<Firaga> so..how come that mouse can bark
<CupcakeWarrior> flutter_spin: I want to see your fanfic
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 you're all a figment of my imagination

<Dark92Enigma> And i thought THAT OTHER BUCKING SHOW was batshit crazy
<Firaga> dammit he knows!
<Midnight_Tempest> oh my god... is this... claymates?
<SteveCharb> brain in a jarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<Shizuka> 13i'm pretty sure i'm a figment of my imagination

<kirzstryfe> 1,3Saturn, maybe you're a figment of your own imagination
<PartyCannon> Saturn I'm an idealist
<DeathStar> figmint od Saturn imagination? better hook up with Saturn
<Meanwhile> Clearly this is the figment of an ants imagination.
<PartyCannon> Shizuka is a glass of water
<DeathStar> *spelling arg
<Shizuka> 13i am always half empty
<Saturn> 08,01kirzstryfe: i don't get nearly enough sex to be a figment of *my* imagination
<Firaga> i am you and you are me and we are all in here toguether
<DaringDude> RRa
<flutter_spin> Well I guesss having 5 OCs in my fanfic was cool :)
<SteveCharb> Shizuka: well you can trust cogito ergo sum... unless cogito ergo sum is ALSO a figment of your imagination!
<DaringDude> Hai everypony :3

<PartyCannon> YES
<Saturn> 08,01come to think of it, you can't all be a figment of my imagination; there's not enough touching in here for that.
<SteveCharb> great way to burn some time, Shizuka
<junh1024-XD> </some SG song>
*DaringDude hugs DeathStar "dance on anyponies head lately?
<Midnight_Tempest> i honestly cant believe this is being played... thats awesome
<SteveCharb> not very practical though

<Kencolt> So, the kid gets turned into blue clay, his dad is kidnapped by a half-naked loony in a tiki mask, and he's now under attack by-- well, everything while he absorbs animal spirits or something. Do I have this right?
<DaringDude> ohai SuperBrony64 i havent seen u around
*DeathStar dances on SuperBrony64 s head "I know ^-^"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DaringDude: Moo :3

<ingwaz> Saturn: because its you, and theyre the "wrong" places ;)
<Darf14> A Stop sign thats green
<Shamroc> Shizuka: thats kicking...

<SuperBrony64> 11,02flutter_spin: It's okie, it's the thought that counts :3
<ingwaz> Saturn: and it hurts so good
<PartyCannon> EIGHT STUNNING ANGLES
*DeathStar hugs SuperBrony64 back
<Vinyer> why not?
<TheRainbowDash> A green stop sign, such logic.
<Vinyer> i just got attacked by ancient bacon
<SteveCharb> aw man I remember when I was a little kid I was a smartass little jerk to everyone, and one time some nerd starting sollipsizing to me and said "there's no way for you to prove to me that you're real" so then I asked him "are you a masochist?" and punched him in the gut.
<DaringDude> dis music :d
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Is mayonnaise an instrument? :I
<Phase4> 00,02^
*Midnight_Tempest crouches and pounces on Shizuka. 'Hugs!'
<flutter_spin> Maybe I'll have you and Wrek do something crazy in my next one... if I make another one
<Saturn> 08,01ingwaz: but the wrong places... wouldn't be good for me? by definition
<Phase4> 00,02i was about to say that Meanwhile
<flutter_spin> do instruments of torture count?
<Meanwhile> ^^
<Darf14> If the stop sign is green in this world, would the Go sign be red?
<Shizuka> 13http://screensnapr.com/v/4k36MC.png
<DaringDude> ..
<TheRainbowDash> Darf14: Probably.
<CupcakeWarrior> SWEEEEEET VICTORY, YEEEAAHH
<Cypresswolf> Oh my gosh, Rampage! That was a fun game :) You play as a giant monster, gorilla, lizard, and a 3rd one I cant remember, and you climb up buildings to smash them down, step on people, tanks, and stuff, even eat people though some victims had negative effects - like eating a nun would result in God striking a lightning bolt at you :D
<SonicSteven1> herro everypony

<Cypresswolf> Primal Rage was a classic too
<Meanwhile> If we could all pretend Shizuka was a fireman or some guy in an ambulance
<ingwaz> Saturn: thats what you think right now ;)
<Saturn> 08,01ingwaz: i don't think you really grasp the concept of "wrong" :P
<Firaga> people talk loud when they wanna sound smart right?
<Darf14> RIGHT!!!!!

<DaringDude> i know the feel
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: Good job!
<Firaga> oh god the music in this game
<Saturn> 08,01for example: if you were to lightly stroke my inner thigh... now, that would be a right place. however, if you kicked me in the bollocks, that would be in the wrong place.
<SonicSteven1> i got a dilema i cant think of a mlp related gamertag ....any ideas?
<Firaga> its drilling into my brain
<ingwaz> wait...i meant pissed off looking asuka Shizuka
<PartyCannon> LOL

<Shamroc> Meanwhile...not my box..
<Polydunami> Nice bomb waste xD
<Lambo> Never played old classic Starfox though, only Starfox 64
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Make due.
<CupcakeWarrior> The boss looks like a penis from the side view
<Polydunami> Egad
<MahBoi777> hmmmmmm, glowing spot seems legit
<Om> And yet I have played games on the 360 with worse mechanics
<Pinkies4thWall> I heard you liek graphics so i spared no expense for these polygons
<Meanwhile> Poached egg is best egg.
<Lambo> So, anyone else watched Game Of Thrones this night?
<Polydunami> This boss makes an appearance in 64, actually
<RainBowJack> Do a Barrle roll
<Firaga> Om: stay away from the indie game section
<MahBoi777> press Z or R twice!
<Lambo> Üpöydunami: Is he the alternative boss of the first world?
<Shamroc> Meanwhile..................yeah i still dont get it...box isnt working..
<Om> Firaga: Or EA xD
<Polydunami> Yeah
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: You got an A!
<Polydunami> Keep Falco alive and fly through the land rings
<Lambo> Wait... Looks like Starfox 64 was just a damn remake of this!?
<MahBoi777> a base in an asteroid field is brilliant!
<Polydunami> Yep
<Firaga> and then peppy became leader of the starfox command
<CupcakeWarrior> MahBoi777: Youre right
*Mutterguy plugs the box in
<CupcakeWarrior> 0_0
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Lambo: Duh :P
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: totally safe
<Polydunami> Well, it was an enhanced remake
<Darkts3> STARFOX
*Meanwhile slaps Shamroc with a rainbow.

<Shamroc> Meanwhile SHH NOPONY MUST KNOW
<Lambo> I still remember every Starfox 64 level I played perfectly
<Meanwhile> I just realised I've been on Bronystate for a whole year.
<Vulpbrony> I am too excited to care to refresh
<MahBoi777> pew pew pew!
<Meanwhile> Doesn't time fly.
*Shamroc claps for Meanwhile
<CupcakeWarrior> Andross' brain creeped me out the first time i beat 64
<MahBoi777> Meanwhile: how does it feel?
<Vulpbrony> I got an idea for a fan fic my friends
<Mutterguy> Meanwhile, ya veteran nao! tell us how it was back in the day!!!
<Polydunami> Vulpbrony, do tell
<Firaga> Lambo: getting the perfect ending just felt good man, and when fox's dad shows up, just tears
<strawberrie_smuckerz> wow...
<Meanwhile> MahBoi777: Like I've seen more films in the past year than I have in the rest of my life combined.
<Vulpbrony> so we got Queen Crystalis
<strawberrie_smuckerz> this channel is certainly spammy
<MahBoi777> lol
<Lambo> Firaga: Never managed to get all the alternative levels :(
<Meanwhile> Mutterguy: Lotto took a lot longer and the site was more rudimentary.
<MahBoi777> Wormhole!
<Vulpbrony> she is pissed
<CupcakeWarrior> YES
<MahBoi777> nope
<MahBoi777> nvm
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: This is the best level
<Mutterguy> strawberrie_smuckerz: I see no one trying to sell me viagra
<Firaga> Lambo: :O do it! emulate that shit if you have too
<Lambo> The Independence-Day level was awesome, with that big ass mothership. Or fighting against Wolf
<MahBoi777> THE AWESOME BLACK HOLE
<Polydunami> So Queen Chrysalis is pissed...
<CupcakeWarrior> Trippy
<MahBoi777> duuuuuuuude
<Meanwhile> Very trippy.
<Polydunami> Wait, Chrysalis gets drunk!?
<Firaga> it sure is giygas in here
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone~
<Lambo> I still can't believe that the whole Starfox crew amputated their legs...
<Mutterguy> and that isn't an invitation to start trying.
<Vulpbrony> she researches Equestria
<Meanwhile> Mah boi, this acid is what all true warriors strive for.
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh wait this isnt the level I was thinking of
<Meanwhile> Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Kriel_Pony> Hi everypony

<Vulpbrony> and finds out there was One Before Celestia
<MahBoi777> Meanwhile: Lol, indeed
<MahBoi777> hi Kriel_Pony
<Meanwhile> Allo Kriel_Pony.
<Polydunami> CupcakeWarrior, were you thinking of "When the Saints Go Marching In"?
<CupcakeWarrior> Yep
<Vulpbrony> the King of Chaos
<Polydunami> Oh god, that was a loopy stage
<Firaga> fun fact, peppy is the only surviving member of the original starfox crew
<Kyu> 07?
<Lambo> It sucked that Starfox 64 didn't have savegames. You had to play it all at once
<Polydunami> I think it was called "Out of this Dimension"
<Lambo> Not replaying
<drf|laptop> 03the one who has a baby
<Mutterguy> Acid? i thiough it was, crushing your enemies, having them driven before you and ...HEARING THE LAMENTATIONS OF THEIR WOMEN!!!
<Meanwhile> This game is a lot more fun with the theme from Power Rangers Turbo playing.
<MahBoi777> xD
<Firaga> Mutterguy: dat conan
<Kyu> 07but what movie lol
<CupcakeWarrior> Wait did SB just shortcut into the hard path?

<drf|laptop> 03the Spice Girls movie?
<Kyu> 07ah
<Kyu> 07right
<Polydunami> Whoa, that's a complex idea
<Mutterguy> specifically Conan the musical
<Lambo> Funny to think that a regular Smartphone of today can play PSOne games already
<MahBoi777> ships bein attacked by metroids
<Vulpbrony> to go after the one pony to secure victory
<Vulpbrony> Celestia
<Kyu> 07it's been ages so I don't remember all of it
<CupcakeWarrior> SPAAAAAAAACE
<drf|laptop> 03they have that friend who's pregnant
<Vulpbrony> make her go crazy
<Firaga> 5,4,3,2,1 Rangers in SPACE!

<Vulpbrony> into a revolt
<drf|laptop> 03they're discussing the movie during the movie?
<CupcakeWarrior> I didnt know power rangers had a SPAAAAACE version
<Meanwhile> CupcakeWarrior: You clearly didn't watch much Power Rangers.
<Firaga> CupcakeWarrior: it was the best fucking season!
<MahBoi777> it's only a matter of time
<Meanwhile> Firaga: Mighty Morphing would like a few words with you.
<Shimmer> Hi I'm new, do europeans gather on any spesific chatroom?
<Vulpbrony> and heres a little fact I glossed over
<Firaga> Meanwhile: please, dat grand finale with zordon doing the thingy
<MahBoi777> welcome Shimmer!
<Vulpbrony> She is USING Discord
<Mutterguy> they had soooo many versions. NZ only got the first one thanks to some idiot doing a kick into a pane of glass and ruining it for the rest of us...
<Firaga> Meanwhile: and bulk and skull just being awesome
<Meanwhile> Plus Mighty Morphing had the best theme.
<Polydunami> Oh hey Shimmer, everyone has the same chatroom
<Meanwhile> PLUS.

<Firaga> Meanwhile: have you even watch it?
<CupcakeWarrior> I didnt think people actually watched power rangers
<Meanwhile> I tried to. It made my face ache.
<Darf14> I wonder whats the next game is
<BlueFlare> 02!drftime
<drf|away-SchoolPC> 02[The current time where I live is 0302:30:4802 on 03Monday, 05/28/201202. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
<Firaga> CupcakeWarrior: some could say the same of MLP really
<Meanwhile> Arguably though, the last Power Rangers I ever watched with much enthusiasm was Dino Thunder. And that was only because Tommy was in it.
<CupcakeWarrior> When I was a kid my favorite shows were Dexter, PPG and My Life As a Teenage Robot
<Shimmer> Any bronies from Norway? :)
<Firaga> Turbo was pretty weak in my opinion
<Mutterguy> CupcakeWarrior: you sir are a man of class
<Firaga> after the glory that was zeo
<Meanwhile> Gold Ranger is best Zeo Ranger.
<Firaga> actually fuck rpm, zeo is my favorite
<Firaga> i wonder what game SB will summon now
<Shamroc> night everypony im hitten the sleep sack for tonight
<Meanwhile> Night Shamroc.
<MahBoi777> I just wonder what Ganon's up to
<MahBoi777> gnigth Shamroc
<Shimmer> Nite!
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: I think you should stream your voice
<Meanwhile> ^
<Polydunami> So let me get this straight. Queen Chrysalis, in anger from losing her recent battle, researches the history of Equestria and finds out there was "One before Celestia". She decides to reanimate Discord and use him in her plan to lead the ponies into revolt againt Celestia... or is it the other way around? That right, Vulp-- oh dang, he left

<Om> I wonder if it is posible not to have played this game...
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive never heard of DK on the 64
<Vordox> SB64...
<MahBoi777> SuperBrony64: O U
<Lambo> But I would rather watch some Banjo Kazooie
<Darf14> I agree, best looking SNES game ever
<SuperBrony64> 11,02CupcakeWarrior: D:
<Firaga> CupcakeWarrior: wut?
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive played all 3 DKC games though
<Firaga> back when rare knew what the fuck it was doing
*Mutterguy has to watch FF13 at some point
<Polydunami> SuperBrony64, I prefer Super Mario Sunshine :3
<CupcakeWarrior> I never had very many 64 games
<Polydunami> For the SNES
<Firaga> he has no swag
<Lambo> That is just King Louie
<Shimmer> Gimme some Pokemon Stadium
<MahBoi777> lol
<Darf14> If I recall, this game has over 200 Golden Banannas to collect
<CupcakeWarrior> My favorite N64 game I had was Pokemon Stadium

<Shimmer> Word CupcakeWarrior
<RainBowJack> DK Rap
<Lambo> CupcakeWarrior: But... how is your favourite game not Ocarina Of Time?
<Om> No matter now nestalgic, I will never like this rap -_-
<Firaga> mine was either kirby crystal shards or majoras mask
<CupcakeWarrior> Lambo: I never had the game
<Polydunami> I preferred Majora's Mask
<Firaga> Lambo: Majoras>ocarina
<Lambo> WHA-
<CupcakeWarrior> Lambo: But I played the 3D version
<Polydunami> I have both on VC
<Polydunami> Oh hell
<Firaga> you could tell rare was just having a blast with this
<CupcakeWarrior> Finally
<MahBoi777> Ded
<Polydunami> Dang, Klump you a party pooper

<Lambo> Wait, did this game have some giant dinosaur in a cage?
<Polydunami> Yep

<Polydunami> Firaga, how come?
<CupcakeWarrior> This is one of the wierdest boss fights Ive seen
<Firaga> i really dont know why, since i really loved shooters like duke nukem 64
<Meanwhile> Agreed.
<MahBoi777> my arm!

<drf|laptop> 03have you heard the song Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg?
<BlueFlare> 02yep
<Polydunami> Crud, I immediately thought of the DOS version
<Darf14> Oh I remember that Duke Nukem game, it was in 3rd person
<Firaga> Darf14: duke nukem has ever been in 3rd person
<CupcakeWarrior> The N64 controller...who thought of that design?
<Polydunami> I think that was Zero Hour, Dark_Horst
<Polydunami> Whoops
<Polydunami> I meant Darf14
<Lambo> CupcakeWarrior: Aliens
<Darf14> Not that I recall
<Mutterguy> Firaga: , there was the platform games in the early 90's

<Derpy_Hooves> Cupcakewarrior: nope, the final boss is much more challenging to get to
<MahBoi777> good try
<Derpy_Hooves> because of that damned nintendo coin
<Darf14> Next game :)
<Shimmer> Gief Pokemon Stadium
<Polydunami> We also had Commander Keen

<Darf14> I really should read my typing before I hit enter
<Firaga> Shimmer: how come?
<CupcakeWarrior> I always died on multiplayer :/
<MahBoi777> didn't they remake this game?
<Firaga> MahBoi777: yup

<MahBoi777> ah
<CupcakeWarrior> This game has the best pause creen music
<Firaga> for the wii, and for ps3/xbox
<Meanwhile> Her majesty's secret service.
<Darf14> I rarely die thanks to Odd Job :) <---- (GET HIM!!)
<Shimmer> Firaga: cuz if I'm not wrong you took Firaga from Final Fantasy? :)
<Meanwhile> It's funny because by and large no one gives a damn about her majesty.
<MahBoi777> mah gun, it go a pew pew
<CupcakeWarrior> dat pause music
<Firaga> Shimmer: funny because i dont have a ps3
<Firaga> wish i had tough

<CupcakeWarrior> Thats the tiny guy right?
<Darf14> yes
<Polydunami> He wasn't tiny in Goldfinger
<Shimmer> Ah, well Firaga is a spell that's in at least half the FF games :p
<Polydunami> But he was mute
<Darf14> ITs always the quiet ones
<Mutterguy> I thought it was just fire 3
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive "played" FFXIII before
<Firaga> so wich one of you was the guy that always picked oddjob because he was so hard to shoot?
<Meanwhile> Dat aim
<MahBoi777> Boom Headshot

<MahBoi777> later XAX!
<Mutterguy> Bye Xax
<drf|laptop> 03and I actually think it sounds better (not just because it's clean), it doesn't sound as old
<Kriel_Pony> Darf14: Yes. Bullet Cake.
<Shimmer> I feel sorry for people who've only played FFXIII/FFXIII-2 and none of the preceding games
<Darf14> bye XAX
<MahBoi777> CupcakeWarrior: you are correct
<CupcakeWarrior> I love 64-bit character models
<Meanwhile> I feel sorry for anyone who's played the FF franchise :P
<BlueFlare> 02yeah
<Polydunami> I've played all except for VIII and XI
<Aircrafter> ( lol ol ol late ) Byes XAX.
<Firaga> Meanwhile: oh you
<Kriel_Pony> Meanwhile: Thats a little mean. I like the earlier ones.
<MahBoi777> I've never played FF
<twilight_sprinkler> VII ftw
<Mutterguy> he's probably going to shoot rabbits or jbe on the computer
<Darf14> Well the only FF games I ever played were 1- 6 am I in the clear?
<Mutterguy> *just be
<drf|laptop> 03but you'll see the chorus still has "smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice"
<CupcakeWarrior> I like FF# (the nes one)
<Firaga> Darf14: yup
<drf|laptop> 03the one I have removes that
<Meanwhile> I'm sure it's a matter of taste but I don't really do turn based combat.
<CupcakeWarrior> FF3*
<drf|laptop> 03it's played on the radio a lot, but I had to actually record it off the radio xD
<drf|laptop> 03then I discovered a German CD single
<twilight_sprinkler> ff7:cc was great
<Kriel_Pony> Darf14: 7,8, and 9 arent bad. Well, the story in 8...
<Shimmer> Meanwhile: if you haven't played FF5-9, I suggest you try :)
<ponybro> hello everypony
<Meanwhile> Turn based is something meant for chess.
<MahBoi777> hey ponybro
<twilight_sprinkler> Meanwhile: btw ff7:cc wasnt turn-based
<Meanwhile> And arguably RAin Slick Precipice of Darkness.
<Firaga> Meanwhile: and pokemon
<CupcakeWarrior> I only play strategy rpgs nowadays
<Polydunami> Oops
<twilight_sprinkler> but chess is awesome!
<Meanwhile> Never cared much for any Pokemon beyond gold.
<Sumica> 00,10Ah goold old tech support. You put in the discription that you have already tried the trouble shootig guides and include the nessacary info such as directX info and tracerout and you get the canned responce telling you to try those things.
<Kriel_Pony> CupcakeWarrior: I tend to prefer action RPGs actually. Currently playing Dragon's Dogma
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkler: Agreed. Chess is good fun.
<Darf14> I never played any of FF games above 7 is because I never owned a Sony Console .... ok there was FF 13 for Xbox but I didnt bother with it
<MahBoi777> Paper Mario was a good game for the N64
<Polydunami> Umm
<Polydunami> Did it die?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bored
<Polydunami> Oh
<Darf14> ok
<Mutterguy> Sumica, abort try or cancel?
<CupcakeWarrior> Apparently there is an FF14
<Shimmer> Darf14: be glad you didn't, FF13 was a disappointment
<Meanwhile> SuperBored64.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Last game
<Mutterguy> *retry
<Kriel_Pony> Sumica: I worked tech support for a few years. Honestly, they don't really teach you much.
*Sumica exacutes a manual precusive reboot on Mutterguy
<Polydunami> Yeah, FF14 was released too soon, apparently
<Meanwhile> Too soon Executus.
<Darf14> I heard that game was a mess
<Shimmer> FF13 is the Final Fantasy MMO, and it blows...
<Shimmer> 14*
<CupcakeWarrior> You would think they would announce FF15 by now
<Spitfire> :V
<Firaga> i never liked the direction FF took after 7, i mean yeah the drama was quite high in 6 but it was well balanced
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
<Meanwhile> Can they not just let FF die?
<Darf14> Probably at the next E3
*DeathStar dances back into chat
<MahBoi777> wonder how many FFs they're gonna make lol
<CupcakeWarrior> I love FF12
*Mutterguy hugs DeathStar
*Meanwhile shines a disco ball at DeathStar.
<MahBoi777> wb DeathStar
<Kriel_Pony> Meanwhile: Why would they? People bitch about the last one and buy the next
<Darf14> Maybe up to FF CCDXXIV?
<CupcakeWarrior> WII
<MahBoi777> seems legit
<Meanwhile> Kriel_Pony: I don't like undead franchises.
<Kriel_Pony> I would rather they just make Kingdom Hearts 3...
<MahBoi777> ooh Gamecube
<Shimmer> I hope they'll make a FFVII remake before they quit the franchise, even though they said they won't :p
<Meanwhile> S'why I don't like anything Nintendo makes.
<MahBoi777> wait no
<CupcakeWarrior> Ive never played KH
<Darf14> yay the Wii
<MahBoi777> Wii
<DeathStar> is sb64 still streaming?
<twilight_sprinkler> Meanwhile: most games are that today
<MahBoi777> DeathStar: yes
<CupcakeWarrior> I didnt like the fact that donald and goofy were in it
<Firaga> thats a gamecube
<Kriel_Pony> Meanwhile: Series never die.
<Meanwhile> Indeed. And I hate most of them.
<Polydunami> Darf14, is that 324?
<Kriel_Pony> CupcakeWarrior: Well it WAS a crossover
<Derpy_Hooves> no sound = u=
<MahBoi777> Rhythm Feva!

<geeky-brony> lol me to dr.timmeywimey
<Lil_B> I made a picture, a ZXSpectrum Version of Chrysalis, anyone want to see it?
<Vordox> derpy_pony: It's a non season now. :P of course it drops
<CupcakeWarrior> Whats a ZXSpectrum?
<geeky-brony> this is not safe
<derpy_pony> between one and two there was a constant rise
<Vordox> Guys..
<Lil_B> CupcakeWarrior a computer from the early 80's it waxs even cheaper than the C64
<Vordox> iSnt that Wii Resort on the water? O.o
<derpy_pony> but...the fanculture products were cooler back then
<Lil_B> CupcakeWarrior and it had quite the grafical limitations XD
<Shimmer> derpy_pony: The internet hype about MLP didn't really catch speed until most of season 1 was over I think
<Vordox> DoctorTimeyWimey: You decide what you play. D: Not us. That's the streamers choice. =3 As long as it's within the rules.
<geeky-brony> afkb

<CupcakeWarrior> Lil_B: How much data could the zx spectrum hold?
<geeky-brony> immm back
<derpy_pony> 64kb?
<Lil_B> CupcakeWarrior i have no idea, i don't know that much about it. But i known that some old computers couldn't hold any datea and everything had to be on Floppy discs
<geeky-brony> which is better marvel or DC
<SirGanjalf> ^flame source
<derpy_pony> Lil_B: there were no hard drives before the late 80s
<CupcakeWarrior> Superbrony64: I liek your mii
<SirGanjalf> derpy_pony: i remeber that C64 was using compact cassettes
<SirGanjalf> not sure about other computers, tho
<Vordox> DoctorTimeyWimey: Can you do the pirate Game? :D

<CupcakeWarrior> CIRNO <3
<Shimmer> The only good thing about Wii; the menu music. I can listen to it for hours
<Vordox> Yoshi's Story, the real sequal. :D
<OtakuTom> Yoshi's Story...wow...
<CupcakeWarrior> Vordox: I liek Cirno
<Vordox> Wait.:Classic Controller? O.o
<Kyiko> chirumiru
<Vordox> CupcakeWarrior: Figured XD
<OtakuTom> I'm sorry...I really disliked this game.
<Life_Essence> Good afternoon everypony
<geeky-brony> yo shimmer chek this out http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/262/4/3/mlp_fim_luna_woona_by_atticus83-d4aaqil.png
<DoctorTimeyWimey> Why is that?
<Shimmer> Yeah I saw :p
<OtakuTom> It could have been so much better than it turned out. Had it been a true sequel to Yoshi's Island with similar gameplay, I would have loved it.
<Lil_B> I wish Nintendo would put out more Soundtrack CDs
<Vordox> Anyone remember http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/2666/wtff.gif? :D
<geeky-brony> k
<CupcakeWarrior> That noise is obnoxious
<Vordox> OtakuTom: HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE Yoshi Story!? D:
<geeky-brony> loz
<CupcakeWarrior> I didnt really like this game either
<OtakuTom> Because just about everyone my age hates it. The sound in itself was beyond sickening.
<DoctorTimeyWimey> What color? And who doesn't like this game. I'll change it if so many people dilskes it >:
<Shimmer> Navy blue!
<DeathStar> DoctorTimeyWimey: green!
<CupcakeWarrior> DoctorTimeyWimey: Pink :3
<DoctorTimeyWimey> hehe sorry.
<geeky-brony> the first i herd of yoish story
<Life_Essence> I've never played it
<Lil_B> actually, Yoshy Story has a soundtrack CD, that got released in Europe
<DoctorTimeyWimey> This use to be my favorite game when I was little.
<OtakuTom> I've played this game all the way through. I had a 100% completion file on it. I had the black and white Yoshis
<Vordox> I like the SNES too, but it's not a bad sequal, so lighten up guys. http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6899/meeeeee.png :3
<Life_Essence> IT'S SO COLOURFUL I'M GONNA DIIIIIE
<Kandarihu> During it's time, I heard nothing but bad things about this game.
<OtakuTom> Yoshi's Island was incredible, and I really think they dropped the ball on this one.
<CupcakeWarrior> Wow, your reward is a black and white yoshi? THOSE ARENT EVEN COLORS
<Lil_B> by Kazumi Totaka, who is one of the most important Nintendo Composers and the Voice of Many Characters, including yoshi himslef
<CupcakeWarrior> Imo, all the sound in this game is really annoying
<Vordox> If anyone says this game is bad...I'll....I WILL... I WILL.!!!!! http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/3362/nabegonemad.gif
<OtakuTom> The menu/page transition music is the worst.
<Kandarihu> Mainly that it it was geared EXCLUSIVELY towards young children. I guess it really conflicted with the social norm of the time that demanded that every thing be dark and edgy.
<CupcakeWarrior> Vordox: Its not bad, I just dont like it
<Shimmer> At least it's keeping me awake by making me try to dig my brain out
<geeky-brony> http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/p480x480/546375_344023338985033_318882981499069_867334_1797385963_n.jpg the cute has ben dupeld
<Meanwhile> Dem cookies.
<Shimmer> Dat nom
<geeky-brony> yup
<Vordox> The music is a bit...decent at most. D: Which is sad.
<Life_Essence> Yoshi is so fruity
<OtakuTom> It's not even that it was geared towards young children that I didn't like. It's more that the game was made to be a sequel to Yoshi's Island, which was an incredible game, but this onejust did not deliver.
<Shimmer> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5008/
<overcastgabe> how do you guys do it in amarica its 4:00 am
<DoctorTimeyWimey> Let me just finish this level and I'll change the game oka? (:
<DoctorTimeyWimey> It's 2 am here (:
<Life_Essence> I have to do it here is Australia for hte premiers
<Life_Essence> they were like 2-4am
<Meanwhile> overcastgabe: It's 9:49 over here :3
<Vordox> DoctorTimeyWimey: :( Sorry about the general consensus, it's not easy being a streamer.
<geeky-brony> wtf did pinky but acid in da pie
<Meanwhile> AM*
<XAX> Evening again
<CupcakeWarrior> Wb XAX
<Lil_B> hello XAX
<Kandarihu> OtakuTom: that's fair.
<Meanwhile> Allo XAX.
<DeathStar> hi XAX wb
<OtakuTom> And there's no clear indication of how to really get everything out of the game. While the goal is to get 30 fruits in each stage, the true way to do it is to get all 30 melons (the light green ones, not the watermelons) in each stage.
<Shimmer> Epic XAX guy
<XAX> :3
<XAX> icwatudidthur
<Life_Essence> epic violin guy is better
*CupcakeWarrior noms XAX
*XAX is nommed
<XAX> im trying to play crash bandicoot here :<

<geeky-brony> :O
<Vordox> <<
<Vordox> geeky-brony: You..need to watch more voice actors. :p
<Life_Essence> someone do one for Tara
<geeky-brony> i know
<Life_Essence> IT DOESN'T FIT
<OtakuTom> I still love Totaka's work in Mario Paint...lol
<Shimmer> Tara is like... 20 different characters
<Lil_B> But he also did the Mario Land 2, worked in Link's Awakening and Mario Paint and i think he did the Wii music
<Bronyx135> Confound these ponies, they drive me to insomnia.
<Life_Essence> I've still got Mario Paint
<Bronyx135> :'(
<Life_Essence> Wacking flies with a mouse
<OtakuTom> I wish I still had my SNES mouse
<Lil_B> OtakuTom I loove the Gnat Attack music XD
<Shimmer> Bronyx135: you too? :D
<Vordox> geeky-brony: http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Andrea-Libman/ <--
<geeky-brony> i miss ed edd and eddy
<OtakuTom> That mini game was by far my favorite thing to do in Mario Paint :D
*Life_Essence whistles Ed Edd and Eddy theme
*Life_Essence then sings Pinkie and the Brain
<OtakuTom> As well as screw around with all the different letters on the title screen (one of the first instances you see of Totaka's Song, too)
<geeky-brony> awesome
<Just> Pssh. No one has Mario Paint. It was simply created by the Government to make it "Seem" as if you could make 8-bit songs. Just like the Rainforests and Eurasia.
<Lil_B> But Hirokazu Tanaka also worked on Mario Paint, and in my Eyes he did almost more for Nintendo then Koji Kondo
<geeky-brony> you tube
<geeky-brony> :)
<Lil_B> Just 8-Bit songs on mario Paint oô
<Life_Essence> Just: I can take a photo of it if you want proof :P
<Lil_B> KIRBY!
<Tov|AshGrain> Hard to believe that Totaka was also the voice of Yoshi.
<Vordox> geeky-brony: http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Shannon-Chan-Kent/ <--- You MIGHT remember a few of these voices. ;D
<Shimmer> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4913/

<Kyiko> World of Goo *o*
