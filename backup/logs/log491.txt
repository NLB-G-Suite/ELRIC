<Drake> 04And why do you need my help
<rdibp> madagascar 3 dosent really look good
<Airpuff> Phase4 was streaming.. but it seems his pc crashed AlienEd27
<Drake> 04I don't know anything about coding
<EggWhite> Greetings everypony.
<rdibp> hai
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hello, EggWhite
<Airpuff> Hai EggWhite
<OctoReikim> 4 gigs of RAM, two cores clocking at over 2 GHz, and I still can't play TF2 on anything other than basic settings. Although that might be my connection, to be honest.
<Phase4> 00,02power dropped THREE TIMES
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Drake> 04Except basic Python
<Airpuff> Wb Phase4 x)
<AlienEd27> ok, i see, hope he comes back on then Airpuff
<Airpuff> :$
<Very_Silly_Filly> OctoReikim: Could be your graphics card
<Phase4> 00,02that washing machine has to go
<Ascendant> still Drake
*rdibp is ded X_X
<Phase4> 00,02keeps tripping the rcd
<Ascendant> I could get Sazerac in
<ACS13123> Phase4: wanna trade some stuff :P
<OctoReikim> Very_Silly_Filly: Yeah, probably is.
*Phase4 00,02hugs Vordox
<Ascendant> and Nyx is far better than I am at python
<Vordox> =3
<Vordox> I hope to see you play with us now!
<Ascendant> You know what I should do Drake
<Vordox> Atleast test it out =3
<Drake> 04[21:46] <%Ascendant> still Drake <-- I fail to see the counterpoint
<Ascendant> I should every single task on that competition
<Very_Silly_Filly> My Graphics card is brilliant, it's an ATI Radeon 6400 HD and the computer it's in can't run TF2
<Phase4> 00,02if i'm lucky
<Ascendant> I should write*
<Phase4> 00,02YES
<Ascendant> in mIRC script
<Very_Silly_Filly> Becuause of it's crappy 1gb :/
<Airpuff> 6_9
<Ascendant> And submit that
<Phase4> 00,02THEY FIXED THE STREAM BUG
<Ascendant> :}D
<Drake> 04[21:47] <%Ascendant> I should every single task on that competition <-- quote material
<Drake> 04LOL
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<ACS13123> :D
<Vordox> Stream bug?
<Airpuff> Wat bug?
<Phase4> 00,02you should see a stream now
<Drake> 04doit
<Airpuff> Yeah.. xD
<AlienEd27> Party with pinkie! awesome song ^_^
<thegt90> hell ill play with ya as soon as i fix my damn pc
<WallDives> I do.
<Ascendant> I'm tempted to
<Shimmer> Very_Silly_Filly: Ram is cheap though, why don't you replace it?
<Ascendant> it seems to fit into the requirements for what language you want to use
<EggWhite> Streams can get ill?
<Ascendant> so presumably it'll work
<Ascendant> mwhahaha
<OctoReikim> Very_Silly_Filly: Want to get together and combine our machines?
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfniCDbbzg << i like this version too
<Phase4> 00,02little lighter than the original
<Ascendant> otherwise I'll use python/C
<Shimmer> Phase4: No utube while streaming, damn noob
<Very_Silly_Filly> Well, chances are other than RAM mine probably would be the more dominant
<Vordox> I never knew that stream had a bug O.o
<Vordox> Your computer probably just needed restart?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, its when you loose a connection
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4 is now a hypocrite now :D
<Airpuff> Lol Shimmer ...
<Phase4> 00,02it would lock server-side and stop me from streaming
<Shimmer> :)
<Vordox> Oh...that's kinda derp. Good thing they fixed it then. =3
<OctoReikim> Very_Silly_Filly: Whoever said that RAM is cheap is completely right. Hell, buy a 2-gig USB stick and hook that up as RAM.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I know that, but I don't have ANY money
<Vordox> A warning, Phase4 , There's plenty of updates on L4D2. So be careful with the download. :P
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma start that downloading
<ACS13123> So Phase4: when its installed...
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, not a problem, i get free steam downloads :3
<OctoReikim> Very_Silly_Filly: A USB drive costs what, 10 bucks now?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm gonna get my laptop fixed and get a graphics card
<Vordox> <.< Oh..Erm...no idea how but GREAT!
<Very_Silly_Filly> OctoReikim: We only have enough money to live on atm
<Shimmer> Getting 16gb for my new pc, that costs me like 150USD I think
<OctoReikim> Very_Silly_Filly: Ah, okay.
<OctoReikim> Not sure how to check my graphics card...anyone else now?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Plus RAM chips are retarded for DDr2
<OctoReikim> *knoe?
<OctoReikim> *know?

<Phase4> 00,02any what now?
<Vordox> Lil_B: Hmmm...Might be a good idea. <.<

<Lil_B> Phase4 our world is in hardmode, Enemies would one-hit you with a new character, but our characters are way to overpowered for a new map, so we will all start at zero

<Jim> It does not look like minecraft -.-
<Jim> have you even played it?
<ninja_pony> wel im going to go to sleep now ladies BYE! everypony sleep well :)
<Jim> night ninja_pony
<Elondras> gnight ninja_pony
<WorldTraveler> it looks like a 2D version of minecraft from what I'm seeing
<User0> WorldTraveler: there are SO many mods, the code is 100% different.
<oni_link> goood night ninja_pony!
<oni_link> rdibp: F*CK YEA
<ninja_pony> night oni_link and every other pony night! :)
<Jim> Besides, notch would be the last person to rip on people for copyright claims
<rdibp> listening to this with your eyes closed dosent sound good
<Spell-of-Gaming> The coding is DEFINATELY different. Minecraft is Java while this is pretty much something made out of scratch.
<WorldTraveler> I wish they would released pre-modded versions of mincraft
<oni_link> rdibp: *impure thoughts*
<WorldTraveler> I can never get mods to work on mine
<WorldTraveler> oh and 1.3 is going to be amazing
<Spell-of-Gaming> WorldTraveler: They're trying to implement a Mod API system
<User0> WorldTraveler: I heard that there was nostalgia or something which can revert minecraft to older versions...

<MegaMoonShine> Bronysith: Terraria
<Elondras> Hi Deleted_dreams
<WindWhistler> lol this is hilarious
<lul> Anyway this meme will get old
<lul> like all other memes.
<WindWhistler> MLP isn't a meme.
<WallDives> like all the other trolls?
<kenne> wouldnt necessarily call it a meme
<oni_link> lul: > implying this is a meme
<Deleted_dreams> alexxm: Good :) valoreins: Hey Elondras: Heyy
<lul> I'm not a troll i'm a hater
<alexxm> fandoms aren't memes
<Gunthler> MLP isn't a meme. It's a way of life.
<lul> And oni_link
<Sundaysmile> trollface been goin strong for around 11 years now
<valoreins> its a part of life, not meme
<lul> You keep saying implying. Got any else to say you fuckhead?
<WindWhistler> Yeah, watch yer language mister
<Spell-of-Gaming> lul: Yes. Get out.
<|Discord|> lul: No it is buckhead I belive
<User0> technically, under the actual definition of a meme, it is indeed a meme.
<WindWhistler> people will get tired of MLP when people get tired of porn.
<Spell-of-Gaming> MLP has the definition of a meme
<Spell-of-Gaming> But not a meme
<WindWhistler> in other words, never.
<valoreins> but then our meme is upgraded into lifestyle
<User0> but the definition of meme extends far beyond what we consider to be meme
<valoreins> or subculture of some sort
<lul> Pinkie pie = a fucking disgrace to the world applejack = a stupid fucking farmer rainbow dash = a flying faggot fluttershy = a bitch and rarity
<Elondras> lul you what a meme is?
<lul> Dont even let me get started on rarity
<oni_link> lul: what

<icybeauti> Phase4: I can do that. Thanks.
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: You're either being a smartass or you missed my joke entirely. I'm going to assume the latter.
<oni_link> well i have 256mb... im chugging at low quality :'(
<Reikim> icybeauti: I have a USB that I always carry with Firefox Portable on it, because frankly IE sucks crap but everyone uses it.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: yea whats the joke lol?
<icybeauti> Reikim: I can do that starting next year.

<User0> panda: do what I do, be on during work
<icybeauti> Imagine how much ping he has right now!
<DaniilScit> I dont have steam now D:
<panda> User0: well... easier said than done ^^
<CK|Bed> I'm officially no longer teaching, school's out and my grades are in. Yay.
<EccoCode> Hi everyone.
<EccoCode> !pokemon
<DaniilScit> I could play with Wrek
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 7Swinub.

<User0> panda: I also have RD on my desk, a brony wristband and a pony belt...
<Soital> 12hello!
<FlareChaser|TF2> nope.
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 3Flaaffy.
<CriticKitten> So, who wants to hear how low the bar has dropped for passing high school in some places?
<alexxm> how far CriticKitten
<icybeauti> CriticKitten: Tell me about it.
<panda> User0: O_O really? all at work? damn, I have to wear a dress shirt and stuff
<FlareChaser|Octavia> and then this happens.
<FillyFlam> MFW I wonder why the soldier's golf club is floppy.
<HiImSpike> random broohoof /)
<MirrorImage> CriticKitten: - you mean apart from the places that don't alow teachers to give a grade below 70%?
<MirrorImage> even if the correct grade is "0"
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser|Octavia: And then no one cared. Ever.
<Nick> hi ecco!
<oni_link> HiImSpike: i miss pc gaming, the orange box is a joke on 360 and its online is dead
<RustyMeat> lol
<User0> panda: I am wearing a nice shirt and khakis, but it is friday so I can justify the belt
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 7Snorunt.
<icybeauti> Can't give below a 70? holy crap!
<MirrorImage> or something like that... might've been 60
<Meanwhile> Dem boots.
<MirrorImage> regardless, there were a few districts around the country that basically said you can't give a failing grade
<MirrorImage> period.
<icybeauti> MirrorImage: Where the hell is that happening?
<EccoCode> How are you all today?
<MirrorImage> don't remember - this was a few years ago i believe
<CriticKitten> I had a conselor asking me if a student could submit any assignments now (a day after school has finished) in order to swing both his second term grade (by 12%) AND his final (by 15%) so that he could pass the class.
<Nick> happy as you know :)
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Bronysith: Get ready, I'm getting Diablo III today :P
<Bronysith> FlareChaser|Octavia: im writing in my chapter man
<HiImSpike> oni_link true have you got your new tower yet
<DaniilScit> Fu,Diablo 3
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Bronysith: yay! new chapter! :D
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: And you said...?
<DaniilScit> 60 euro
<icybeauti> That's really weird. But on second thought, they literally pass anyone in my school to get them off their backs.
<MirrorImage> basically
<CriticKitten> Yes, that's right: a kid with a 48% for his class work and 45% on the final, and the conselor wanted me to swing his grade with last minute work. >_>
<CriticKitten> I said no.
<Bronysith> FlareChaser|Octavia: no. im writing in my book
<CriticKitten> Because I had already gifted him several HUNDRED points in the past two weeks.
<Litwick> >in shipping with 5 different users on tumblr >feels good man
<EccoCode> glad to hear, ^^
<Sumica> 00,10What to do with my new found day off.
<oni_link> HiImSpike: nah i gotta save up. i havent been to work like in 3 months cause of a skating accident. dat california lifestyle
<MirrorImage> Sumica: ponies?
<HiImSpike> LOL scoot scootalo is doing a livestream reading my little dashy
<icybeauti> Sumica!
<Reikim> Sumica: Ponies.
<Meanwhile> Sumica: You live in Vegas. What do people usually do in Vegas?
<MirrorImage> i believe there's a mini-marathon on The Hub right now
<Rain> Sumica, you buy a ps3 and then play a game with me
<CriticKitten> The only reason he had a 48% was that he received several hundred points in the last week or two that brought his grade up by well over 10%.
<MirrorImage> or rather, they don't normally show 4 separate episodes in a row like they are like now
<CriticKitten> >_>
<Sumica> 00,10but i am broke due to having to replace car battery erlyer this week.
<Reikim> Sumica: We hold a massive TF2 tournament culminating in a showdown between regulars and mods.
<FillyFlam> CriticKitten: Those are the kids who don't care until like the last week and then complain about how unfair their teachers are for not handing them a passing grade on a silver platter. They deserve to fail.
<Rain> that sucks, sumi
<icybeauti> People usually spend the whole year not caring.
<DaniilScit> Wrek is =+PRO+=
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Gutted. Well, stay inside all day watching tv and eating ice cream.
<CriticKitten> So I was like "dude, I already gifted him way more than I feel morally correct in gifting him, there's no way I'm going to drive thirty minutes back to school just to grade something ELSE so he can pass".
<HiImSpike> oni_link what are going to have in it, besides if you have steam you can redownload your games to your new computer hold in their buddy
<icybeauti> I have to go now. Class is ending. Bye guys!
<FlareChaser|Octavia> bye
<Meanwhile> Seeya ic-gine.
<Meanwhile> gone*
<FlareChaser|Octavia> valoreins: whatcha doing? :3
<HiImSpike> byr
<Sumica> 00,10Will go in to work later to get payed but yeah. Worked too far ahead the last few days
<Elondras> CriticKitten This kid should be thankfull that you already gave him this point's
<alexxm> bye Icybeauti
<CriticKitten> To fulfill this hypothetical scenario in which he passes? I'd have to drive thirty minutes to the school, grade whatever assignment I gave him, and then fill out the paperwork to change it. I was like "yeah no."
<FlareChaser> Alright, time to stalk wrek.
<valoreins> FlareChaser|Octavia: I'M DOING NOTHING! NOTHING SUSPICIOUS AT ALL!
<MirrorImage> wrek - that was a kritzkrieg, not a medigun...
<FlareChaser> valoe....that makes me suspicious..
<FlareChaser> valor*
<Sylandest> valoreins: you are now completely suspicious
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Kid deserves to fail. Little bastard.
<oni_link> HiImSpike: yeah i didnt have much on Steam cause i had discs (which i lost) i guess i can get TF2 since its f2p now and i think i had SFIV on steam
<CriticKitten> He's a nice kid, don't get me wrong, but this is something I had to take a stand on.
<Meanwhile> One does not simply übercharge with a kritzkrieg.
<valoreins> o.o
<FlareChaser> valoreins: what are you doooing? :|
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile: unless you're playing Vs Saxton Hale
*valoreins backs away from the bronystate lounge
<LoGaN> Hi everypony!
<Meanwhile> Eh, I never use kritzkrieg.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: I find teachers these days tend to be way too lenient. Congratulations.
<LoGaN> im back
<valoreins> ohai LoGaN
<Meanwhile> Allo LoGaN.
<Sumica> 00,10Kinda want to play some redfacton some more. so I will
<Sylandest> FlareChaser: he acts suspiciously...pursue and capture!
<Elondras> Hi LoGaN
<alexxm> hey LoGaN hows your day been
<Rain> :p
<LoGaN> ok i guess
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Hammer time?
*FlareChaser grabs valoreins "where are the cupcakes?" :|
<FlareChaser> I must have cupcakes.
<valoreins> WAT CUPCAKES?!?!
<CriticKitten> Oh no, don't get the situation wrong. He's a good kid. He's just very lazy because he's decided that he can't do math. Unfortunately, while I like him as a person, I can't justify helping him graduate when he did much less work than the people I *did* save
<FlareChaser> one does not simply snipe Wrek.
<HiImSpike> oni_link sorry for your loss man hurts to hear
<Elondras> i'm off for a while i need to check what my gamer clan is doing...
<User0> FlareChaser: I've traded headshots with Wrek
<CriticKitten> If you lower the bar too much, they'll trip over it when they get to the real world.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Well that's unfortunate. That's always the worst case, isn't it? When the student just gives up.
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser: so have I.
<HiImSpike> cya elondras
<oni_link> HiImSpike: I wasnt a hardcore TF2 player but its my motivation to get a new tower now :)
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile: yeah its pretty easy, except I use the Sydney Sleeper.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: I *hate* when it happens. It makes me really sad because they're always so close, but they just....stop.
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser: So you're not a real sniper. Good to know.
<LoGaN> mt lil pwny
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Amen there.
<LoGaN> my*
<CriticKitten> Reikim: They often don't realize how close they were.
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile: Sniper is my most played class :|
<Meanwhile> Sydney Sleeper, pfft. What a stupid idea for a weapon.
<Reikim> FlareChaser: /)
<Meanwhile> "Oh hey lets give the snipers who can't aim a reason to exist"
<Meanwhile> Genius.
<FlareChaser> Actually, its helps my team a lot too.
<User0> Meanwhile: Machina isn't much better...
<Reikim> Meanwhile: It's good training for junior snipers.
<Meanwhile> I use a classic. I have done for several years.
<User0> I only quickscope...
<FlareChaser> User0: ...no..
<Sumica> 00,10indeed hammer time
<MirrorImage> sidney sleeper is good if you can prioritize right
<Meanwhile> You want to practice with a sniper rifle, practice with a rifle that requires a bit more skill.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Yeah, but most people have to work up to the vanilla rifle.
<MirrorImage> it's also fun to skeet-shoot rocking jumping soldiers with it
<MirrorImage> "PULL!" *pfft*
<Sumica> 00,10guess I'll set up
<Wrek> 05or not sumi
<Spell-of-Gaming> Holy crap
<oni_link> can we all agree that cod4 is best cod? :)
<Reikim> Meanwhile: I had to use the piss-rifle briefly before I figured out the sensitivity of controls, where to hide, and whatnot.
<Meanwhile> I have no respect for anyone who tries to pass the sydney sleeper off as a weapon that has any place in the game.
<Sumica> 00,10oki have fun then wrek
<Spell-of-Gaming> I never knew Android smartphones were that generous
<Meanwhile> Or anyone who mains it.
<alexxm> so the whip makes you go faster
<RustyMeat> dat snipe
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile: i main the Huntsman actually
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile: it helps your team a lot, I dont see whats wrong with it.
<Meanwhile> MirrorImage: That's nice?
<Spell-of-Gaming> They're asking to transfer iPad data to your ANDROID smartphone.
<MirrorImage> but i'm just saying that the Sleeper isn't "bad"
<MirrorImage> it's just different
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser: What's wrong with it is it's the talentless snipers weapon.
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile: then whats a good sniper weapon?
<Meanwhile> A rifle that can't make a headshot isn't a rifle.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: *cough*Huntsman*cough*Degroot*cough*
<MirrorImage> yes, but a rifle that makes your heavy on the front line go "lolded" even more than he normally does...
<User0> insert jarate instead?
<Meanwhile> Any sniper weapon that can actually land a headshot and make you try and aim better is a good one.
<FlareChaser> TF2 is about teamwork, not headshots and kills.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02^^
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile: remember that Sniper is a "support" class, not an "offense" class
<DaniilScit> TF2 about hats
<Phase4> 00,02if only i could get my brother to understand that
<Phase4> 00,02allso dat DaniilScit
<MirrorImage> kills are good, but it's not what it's explicitly supposed to do
<Phase4> 00,02:P
<oni_link> this is also why BF3 and FS are good FPS titles as well
<Sumica> 00,10tempted to join
<Reikim> Phase4: Does your brother play CoD? Because that might be the problem.
<Wrek> 05but as sniper
<RustyMeat> so much whipping
<Wrek> 05each headshot helps the team
<Meanwhile> Protip, you support the team more by killing the opposing team and the classic is better for that.
<DaniilScit> TF2 about hats and metal
<Phase4> 00,02Reikim, no but he wants to
<Meanwhile> Exactly.
<MirrorImage> indeed, and so does Jarate
<DaniilScit> 2.99 ref
<DaniilScit> about 2.99 ref
<Meanwhile> You can deck a fully healthed heavy in one good headshot.
<Phase4> 00,02dat 2.99
<Rain> dat riding crop
<DaniilScit> Hat for 2.99
<DaniilScit> ref
<alexxm> what excuality does the whip do

<Rain> having to restart my desktop and then I will be joining you wrek and Sumica :3
<Reikim> Gonna put this out here now: every team needs more medics. No exceptions.
<Meanwhile> Idk, I've seen enough people wander into sentry gun fire because of unexpected speed boosts to question it's use.
<Spell-of-Gaming> They allow you to transfer stuff from a non-Samsung device.
<Rain> I make a great medic
<Meanwhile> ^
<User0> Reikim: I had a game where we were all medics - it failed pretty badly...
<Reikim> User0: I'm referring mostly to the fact that so many players refuse to play medic.
<Rain> I also make a decent sniper
<oni_link> Spell-of-Gaming: i plan on getting an S3 at the end of the year
<Meanwhile> Didn't know you played Rain.
<User0> Reikim: I know, but I took screenshots of so many medibeams
<Rain> every now and then

<EggWhite> My days been good I've been playing Terraria how about you?
<Reikim> User0: That's bad. It's supposed to be pop-Ubersaw the crap out of the team-switch and pop.

<FlareChaser> I'm busy watching Wrek with the Machina cause I want to learn how to use it well.
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, O_O

<Razor-0Comie> nope
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: nope
<Reikim> bah, lag made me useless
<FlareChaser> damnit.
<alexxm> FlareChaser what does that do
<Reikim> Machina is essentially just like regular rifle only you can't do unscoped shots.
<Reikim> Now goodbye everyone, I'll be back...later...maybe?
<Razor-0Comie> Anyone here watch Regular Show??
<User0> they should make a headshot only sniper (possibly something to promote quickscoping)
<alexxm> bye Reikim
<JRP2234> sumica tell Phase4 to go to bed
<alexxm> Razor-0comie i used to
<Bronysith> Reikim: pierce the heavens
<Reikim> User0: Already is. Only Spy can do it too, and only with one weapon.
<FlareChaser> User0: thats pretty much the Bazaar BArgain.
<Reikim> User0: Also the charge function actively discourages quickscope.
<User0> FlareChaser: but losing count from missing is not good for quickscoping...
<User0> Reikim: nah, it still hits for instakills on weaker classes
<Sumica> 00,10just a few dozen keys
<FlareChaser> TF2 aint Co
<Reikim> Quickscope is actively discouraged in TF2.
<FlareChaser> CoD

*Iron_Edge hugs Derpy_at_work
<valoreins> brb grabbin pillz
<ThunderDash> whoa
<Leadhoof> Newp. I was just playin' World of Warcraft and got a "Page Fault in Non-paged Area".
<LoGaN> h
<Leadhoof> Computer booted up fine and everything is normal. :|
<alexxm> odd Leadhoof
<Leadhoof> inorite?
<alexxm> yeah
<alexxm> so what now
<alexxm> who set off the party cannon
<Leadhoof> Scared the crap outta me, it did. Just going to go about my business today. Guild Wars 2 beta in a couple hours.
<alexxm> hope that goes well Leadhoof
<Leadhoof> Thanks. <3
<LoGaN> im listening to flutterwonder
<LoGaN> anypony?
<alexxm> so whats the worst game you guys have played
<LoGaN> hmm...
<LoGaN> idk
<alexxm> did everyone die
<Leadhoof> Hrm.
<Randomnerd> READY THE PARTY CANNONS!
<AzulaSurge> alexxm: recently? I'd say Vanquish or Bulletstorm
<Randomnerd> FI-YAAAAAAAAAH!!!
<Kandarihu> Right now, the only two games that come to mind are Rise of the Robots and Pitfighter
<alexxm> AzulaSurge how bad are they
<LoGaN> bulletstorm is fun
<alexxm> Kandarihu never heard of the robot one how bad is it
<Master_Derpy> gg
<Leadhoof> I'm not sure I've every played any truly bad games.
<Leadhoof> Oh, wait.
<Leadhoof> Lair.
<Leadhoof> Honestly, I loved Lair, but it had so many flaws I had to force myself to finish it.
<AzulaSurge> LoGaN: it's a modern FPS with fun weapons that you can't use properly because the enemies never collaborate :D
<alexxm> that the dragon one that was supposed to demo the sixaxxis controller Leadhoof
<Kandarihu> Leadhoof: the graphics are better than normal for the SNES and there's this nice SPC guitar riff in the beginning, and that's al that's good about it.
<FlareChaser> valoreins: you...are...going..TO FINISH ME!
<Leadhoof> Yup, alex. That's the one.
<Meanwhile> Well, that was fun. Can't play while eating though.
<Kandarihu> It's a fighting game where the main character doesn't, to my knowledge, have any special moves.
<valoreins> FlareChaser: that sounds kinky...
<FlareChaser> valoreins: ....you shall...finish...my DRAWING!
<alexxm> is this pitfighter or rise of the robots Kandarihu
<valoreins> oh lol
<Kandarihu> RotR
<alexxm> ah right thanks
<valoreins> wait 1 more week until i finish my finals
<Randomnerd> LOVE ME!!! :[
*alexxm hugs Randomnerd
<LoGaN> hey thats mine!
<Kandarihu> So yes, there is ONE protagonist who fights different robots during the story mode.
<Leadhoof> I wanted it to be great. Freakin' love games like that, but that sixaxis was just...ugh. So unresponsive and hardly ever did what you wanted it to. Honestly, motion controls don't belong in certain genres on gaming.
*Randomnerd hugs alexxm back.
<LoGaN> wont let me talk
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<Kandarihu> And the Vs mode is just a reinactment of the story mode battles with p2 controlling the bad guy. So Player one can only choose the hero to play as.
<LoGaN> there we go
<BlueFlare> 02http://www.lugia.co.uk/chatstats/silverwings_relmap.png
<alexxm> Leadhoof i thought the heavenly sword bit with the arrows was a good demostration of sixaxxis
<BlueFlare> 02drf is in the very middle of everyone
<Kandarihu> You know what? I didn't really hate playing Pitfighter after all.
<LoGaN> (\
<Leadhoof> Let's see...oh, right. Mission objectives were thrown at you left and right and many times you could fail if you didn't figure out which one you had to jump on ASAP, which, again, would be a problem when the sixaxis didn't do what you wanted.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Cupcakes ^-^
<LoGaN> *(\ brohoof
<Meanwhile> So sweet and tasty
<Kandarihu> Oh, this music. It's too awesome

<Kandarihu> Congratulations, SuperBrony64|AFK
<alexxm> lucky SuperBrony64|AFK
<Leadhoof> There was a little stylized arrow at the top of the screen that pointed you in the direction of your objectives. Sort of. It was angled in such a way that you couldn't tell if it was poiting in front of you or behind you.
<TheRainbowDash|Busy> SuperBrony64|AFK: Your so lucky, SuperLucky64.:D
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02i liek lucky :3c
<LoGaN> hi TheRainbowDash|Busy
<Leadhoof> Good points of Lair: Loved the scenery and the story, and the music is brilliant. I bought the soundtrack on iTunes.
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 11,02Anyway, heading out again, see ya >>

<Meanwhile> Have fun SB.

<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi Very_Silly_Filly
<alexxm> hey Very_Silly_Filly has the bleeding stopped
<AzulaSurge> Hey Very_Silly_Filly!
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Ooh, is this castle wolfenstein 3d?
<Kandarihu> It's a multiplayer game where you're running around as a team of wizards fighting monsters.
<Very_Silly_Filly> had the amptation taken out and had my wrist put in a strap
<Very_Silly_Filly> atim. cannot move my right hand
<alexxm> Kandarihu is it good
<Kandarihu> You can do amazing amounts of damage, but can take very little damage.
<Very_Silly_Filly> but its not bleeding
<Yokupony> dat MIDI
<AzulaSurge> :O DOOM <3
<Elondras> ....
<Kandarihu> And team damage is always on... so you end up killing each other as much as the enemy.
<alexxm> anyone know the bible game that used wolfensteins source code
<Dances_With_Discord> And they say this causes kids to be violent ;)
<WallDives> ikr?
<GlutenFreeJenkins> ^^
<Yokupony> alexxm: Super Noah's Ark 3D

<AzulaSurge> Kandahiru: but that's the fun part of coop :D screwing your team over
<Kandarihu> So it's not really Co-op. I've heard it described as Troll-op.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :3
<Om> Kids=Violet
<sub06905> ded

<AzulaSurge> alexxm: violence and the possibility to turn your enemies into gibs
<sub06905> gibs?
<alexxm> thanks AzulaSurge and Dances_With_Discord
<Nick> current: 360, Wii, DSi, 3DS
<junh1024-XD> w0w
<Dances_With_Discord> *Shrugs*
<Kandarihu> AzulaSurge: L4D has the limited function of helping fallen team mates up before they die. Magicka gives you a spell to ressurect dead team mates just so that death is cheap.
<Nick> but there's actually games I want for the PS3 mainly the new Sly Cooper and the smash bros style game
<Yokupony> *Is pretty hyper*
<Jspang1> DOOM!!!!! :)
<AzulaSurge> No Wrek, use rockets/machinegun/plasmagun against revenants! :D
<Yokupony> *hugs Wrek* I'm know that feel bro :(
<Nick> but yeah I'd also like GoW3, MGS4, Killzone 2&3 and try the uncharted games certainly but if all those goes to vita then I'd prefer that
<CrazyCherry> HERP
<sub06905> DERP
<alexxm> herpaderp
<Nick> but PS3 has better download titles such as the PsOne and PS2 classics, but then again I want the original PS3 for its backwards compatability since i have a tonne of PS2 games still
<AzulaSurge> sub06905: gibs, or tiny chunks of meat :D
<Nick> my PS2 died :(
<Kandarihu> Right now, the game alone is $2.49. The game with all the DLC is $6.24. Next week, the next major DLC is coming out and will retail for a normal price of $4
<sub06905> AzulaSurge: oh :D
<junh1024-XD> ask drf
<AzulaSurge> I've played this mod, it's hard
<CrazyCherry> Twilight pls!

His purpose is to quicken the game, and if the player is touched by him, they are killed. What makes this enemy so frightening is that he’s immortal, he can go through walls and he’s always coming after you."
