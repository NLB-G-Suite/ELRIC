<Kawaii_icybeauti> sweet, you're gonna draw?
<MrBen> Say, can I suggest something? If for whatever reason my choice of B-Movie gets WMC, can we watch LittleKuriboh's version instead?
<Bronysith> Yahooz: in my slumber i didst hear it
<Yahooz> A GUNSHOT
<Bronysith> bang
<Yahooz> good lord when is 15 coming out :/
<MrBen> Just pre-empting the suggestion.

<Bronysith> Yahooz: you mad? you're mad

<Lightningwolf> lol
<Dovah> Scoot-Scootaloo: yay :)
<Yahooz> Scoot-Scootaloo: also watching it get WMC
<Dken2021> isn't Blue Eyes Shining Dragon a useless card?
<Yahooz> the plot holes are ENDLESS
<Dovah> Dken2021: no
*CK|Ded eyerolls
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO
<Yahooz> not pony intended

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03LEGIT*
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/d7amC Wrek
<J_E_Smith71> Dken2021: I dunno but in the show it was badass.
<Yahooz> BESD is a great card
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wrek: You should draw a Blue Eyes White Dragon
<Yahooz> or at least was
<CK|Ded> If Pyramid of Light gets WMC'd, I insist that we go back and WMC about six other movies on the old roster.
<CK|Ded> Because it's seriously not WMC material.
<Yahooz> and then Alej was Kaiba
<Dovah> Blue Eyes is THEE Most Badasss MLG LEGIT PRO muthabuck EVER!
<J_E_Smith71> Scoot-Scootaloo: How about a Blue Eyes Whiet Spike:D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Kaiba is premier MLG
<CK|Ded> So the only way to rationalize it is to raise the bar by a lot. <_<
<J_E_Smith71> Dang it typos
<MrBen> I just want to say, I have NEVER seen Pyramid of Light. At all.
<CCCP> im sad that we will never watch Human Centipede here :(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03A Blue Eyes White Spike.... someone do that
<superretroworld> if most of us are complaining about the yu gi oh movie, cant we just cancel it?
<Yahooz> howabout...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No.
*CK|Ded doesn't get people's obsession with that clause anyways. It's supposed to be for things that are literally unwatchable.
<Bronysith> CCCP: you are disgustinjhg
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: In Spike form or Giant Dragon form?
<Dken2021> alright, just bought Garry's Mod

<MirrorImage> bit of a framerate issue compared to normal
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: Ah. I thought I asked that before, but...bad memory.

<Bronysith> Buytoast: you expected wrong
<Bronysith> taoumi: but hasbro wouldnt do that, they didnt do that with youtube vids
<Bronysith> unless they decide to be jerks
<taoumi> i think it's butts that tell on the artists

<Shizuka> 13if somepony felt that explosion
<Bronysith> hey killerpony7733
<Shizuka> 13it was shizu wub hitting the roof :3
<LadyCanary> <3
<LadyCanary> Shizu, that drawing will be absolutely adorable.
<Shizuka> 13<3
<killerpony7733> Bronysith I'm here don't fret
<Bronysith> anything Wrek draws is either sexy or adorable...sometimes both
<Bronysith> taoumi: killerpony7733 is the guy who wants 2 plushies made
<RaveBrony> O_o
<MadSurge> Shizuka: any particular reason you like Vivi so much, besides her adorableness? :)
<DerpyWhooves> Wow, the chat already crashed.
<Shizuka> 13because vivi ist best pony~
<DerpyWhooves> I hate this laptop.
<taoumi> oooh
<LadyCanary> Damn right shizu.
<killerpony7733> Bronysith I may not had told. But i kinda had to turn down then thought for a reason
<Bronysith> ahh~
<Bronysith> jeez it sounds like someone caught the flu
<DerpyWhooves> Wwat game is this?
<DerpyWhooves> *What
<Bronysith> planetside2
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: do you have steam? :O
<DerpyWhooves> Oh, he sure plays this a lot.
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, yes I do. My Steam nick is Kandarihu
<cachi01> Bronysith: yeah me :I
<Bronysith> so who knows how to make cupcakes?
<cachi01> everything tastes like shit
<Kandarihu> Oh right. You're already on my friends list
<sub06905> oh look its Wrek :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have stated an opinion
<Bronysith> oh look its another person
<DerpyWhooves> Hmm, do they do movies anymore?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Legend of Equestria is going to be horrible
<CrimsonPhoenix> but not because of the content
<DerpyWhooves> What is Legend of Equestria?
<cachi01> looks fine to me CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, again, not because of the content
<DerpyWhooves> Hmm.
<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix Community is my guess?
<cachi01> DerpyWhooves: a MLP mmo
<CrimsonPhoenix> killerpony7733, Yeah pretty much
<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix Ah any specific reason you say that?
<CrimsonPhoenix> mostly horrible OC everywhere
<Bronysith> chat needs more plushies
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> if not OC it would be pretend characters
<d3rb> indeed Bronysith
<d3rb> vinyl plushies
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: oooh lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> I saw "Mic" in one screenshot
<Saturn> 08,01FlutterMac is adorable
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Doctor Whooves in another
<Bronysith> Saturn: oh god yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> also some horrible color scheme
<taoumi> funny thing about that i was going to make a vinyl for my convention display
<LadyCanary> Eeeeyup Saturn :)
<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix Oh yeah surely, i mean you could always encounter good OC's and all but yeah theres a huge % that will be bad and horrible sadly
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<cachi01> 80% will be alicorns
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<cachi01> lost brothers or sisters of celestia
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, is that an option?
<Bronysith> cachi01: try 95%
<CrimsonPhoenix> please someone tell me no
<CrimsonPhoenix> PLEASE
<killerpony7733> cachi01 Actually you can only choose 3 options earth pegasi unicorn
<CrimsonPhoenix> thank you
<cachi01> oh thx god
<AJIsAwesome> Alicorn BETTER NOT be an option.
<cachi01> might be for the mods
<killerpony7733> Each with their respective racial benefits
<cachi01> or u might have to pay for it
<LunasGuard> nice shot
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, a MLP fan game? Pay content?
<CrimsonPhoenix> no just no
<cachi01> who knows
<MirrorImage> CrimsonPhoenix - yeah, won't happen
<MirrorImage> Hasbro would be on them in a heart beat
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<cachi01> we never expected mario to have DLC
<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix Nope LOE said it's a pure no with money
<cachi01> and then
<MirrorImage> assuming it doesn't get shut down on principle before then
<cachi01> BOOM
<killerpony7733> They make it for free
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, Mario is marketing, fan-made content isn't
<BaconMane> 0,5Hihi
<MirrorImage> killerpony7733 - "free" doesn't matter when it comes to copyright
<MirrorImage> which is why Shards of Equestria was shut down
<killerpony7733> MirrorImage Really depends on how you go with it i believe
<cachi01> shards of equestria?
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: Wait, they wanted you to pay for SoE?
<MirrorImage> killerpony7733 - lets put it this way. Fanfiction is still in a rather gray area
<cachi01> Sony online entertainment.
<MirrorImage> but most companies tolerate it
<cachi01> Shards of Equestria
<cachi01> wuuuuut
<CrimsonPhoenix> cachi01, also one could clearly see the DLC in Mario the moment Nintendo announce DLC in 3DS that will start with Fire Emblem
<MirrorImage> cachi01 - it was a fan-made expansion to Magic: The Gathering with a MLP theme
<BaconMane> 0,5Hihi
<LadyCanary> Hiya BaconMane
<AJIsAwesome> Ohai, BaconMane :O
<cachi01> MirrorImage: oooh

<[SWAG]Haku> Yo Bronysith, wazzup?
<taoumi> i haven't used that since middle school xD
<dukedontnukem> im gonna redownload steam later
<[SWAG]Haku> Who is this that is playing?
<Brad[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/tRdGM.jpg legs and tail done for rainbow dash, a regular sized rainbow dash for reference beside it.
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: why that is Wrek
<[SWAG]Haku> huh
<[SWAG]Haku> I always picked him... differently
<[SWAG]Haku> *pictured
<LadyCanary> Pew pew~
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: so if interested talk with taoumi about plushies
<Dovah> [SWAG]Haku: I always pictured him with a battle axe before i saw him.
<[SWAG]Haku> I do not know who that is
<cachi01> Brad[Laptop]: hey thats awesome what material do you use?
<Brad[Laptop]> cachi01 abs plastic
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: he just got on bronystate
<[SWAG]Haku> oh
<Brad[Laptop]> I have yet to paint one though i need to get some courage to paint them :P
<Spectrum_Rush> I see Wrek exactly as I saw him, I can tell just by his ponified self
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: he makes plushies and i met him at dragoncon, he made one for wrex and sent it to him and is actually working on a luna one right now
<Spectrum_Rush> and yes that was horrible grammar
<[SWAG]Haku> cool
<Bronysith> where is taoumi hes been idle for a little bit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i can justify spending 100 bucks in shirts and a bag, sadly i can't justify spending 100 bucks on a plushie otherwise i would buy one
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<taoumi> i'v been talkign to CrimsonPhoenix
<Bronysith> ahh
<[SWAG]Haku> lol
<[SWAG]Haku> Hello new person
<[SWAG]Haku> I am Haku
<[SWAG]Haku> And I am your god
<Bronysith> i just want to huggle luna
<Brad[Laptop]> I spent $100 on a rainbow dash & a rarity hat from ebay
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: I saw as a little bit older. Judging by his facial features, I though he would've look about 3-4 more years than he does now.
<Barbetos> Fia from the fia man
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> No god of mine would use [SWAG]
<d3rb> that seems conservative compared to some plushies Brad[Laptop]
<Bronysith> ^
<Bronysith> what TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Bronysith> said
<Yahooz> Woah
<Spectrum_Rush> AJIsAwesome: he looks older with glasses
<Yahooz> Haku is back :3
<Bronysith> Yahooz: you are now on fire
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, it's called handicraft
<[SWAG]Haku> IVE BEEN THROUGH THIS
<sub06905> would you prefer YOLO? :D
<LadyCanary> :o
<[SWAG]Haku> I DO NOT USE swag
<[SWAG]Haku> I USE SWAG
<Bronysith> sub06905: nooooooooooooooo
<CrimsonPhoenix> you pay someone to spend their time on something you want
<Yahooz> SWAG! PUNCH IT!
<[SWAG]Haku> 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS
<LadyCanary> <3 Wrek <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not industrial
<LadyCanary> YESSSS.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CrimsonPhoenix wrong ping perhaps ?
<[SWAG]Haku> SWAG > swag
<sub06905> wut :I
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/0Gw0U.gif HOLY MARMALADE OF SWEET SUGARY GOODNESS
<[SWAG]Haku> Its hard to explain
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: True, but I saw his OC with some facial wrinkles. That's why I thought he was a couple years older than he looks like.
<d3rb> being normal > SWAG > swag
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, no I'm pinging the right person
<Yahooz> [SWAG]Haku: what is your stance on YOLO?
<Brad[Laptop]> d3rb I know, you can really go nuts if you want.
<LadyCanary> :I
<[SWAG]Haku> fuck YOLO
<CrimsonPhoenix> you pay someone for their time and talent
<Brad[Laptop]> I dont mind spending money on stuff I like.
<Spectrum_Rush> pffft swag, hah I don't need swag when I've got Mojo baby yeah
<Yahooz> :/
<LadyCanary> Swaggery.
<Brad[Laptop]> Entertainment is worth a lot to me.
<sub06905> so is there a diffrence of yolo and YOLO?
<Yahooz> swagtology
<Bronysith> having inteligence>Normal>retarded>swag>yolo
<superretroworld> Bronysith: and we'll never know what happened to them
<sub06905> on*
<[SWAG]Haku> The only Mojo Haku cares for is Mojo Jojo
<CrimsonPhoenix> paying 100 for something in stores that's made in factories now THAT's expensif
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CrimsonPhoenix oh i see i lost where the convo was going still i can't justify a 100 bucks plushie because it has no practical use for me
<d3rb> swag 101, how to be a tool
<Spectrum_Rush> sub06905: one is you saying it the other is you screaming it
<[SWAG]Haku> No there is not a differences between yolo and YOLO
<cachi01> swag 101 how to be stupid
<LadyCanary> Why not Aku, [SWAG]Haku :|
<twilight_sprinkle> YOLOMLGSWAG
<[SWAG]Haku> Aku is awesome
<cachi01> yolo 101 how to be even more stupid
<Brad[Laptop]> A plush is totally practical, it sits on your desk and looks good.
<Brad[Laptop]> :P
<[SWAG]Haku> Look
<LadyCanary> YOLO 101: Carpe Diem for dumbasses.
<AJIsAwesome> Aku: "Long ago, in a distant land,"
<d3rb> should combine the swag and yolo classes, basically the same thing
<[SWAG]Haku> Me and several other people made a bronystate clan type thing
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Brad[Laptop] i already have a applejack and twi to do that
<Bronysith> what LadyCanary said
<[SWAG]Haku> we made up a name
<Brad[Laptop]> TheGreatAndPowerfulT lol
<Barbetos> Sounds like a bug
<[SWAG]Haku> and turned into an acronyn for SWAG
<Brad[Laptop]> TheGreatAndPowerfulT Im kind of cheating, I can just make a new pony whenever I want
<Barbetos> Red fuckers? as in Tr? I resent that.
<[SWAG]Haku> So We're All Gods
<[SWAG]Haku> SWAG
<d3rb> ah huh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Brad[Laptop] soap ones or modeling clay?
<LadyCanary> Ahhh interesting.
<Brad[Laptop]> TheGreatAndPowerfulT plastic
<Brad[Laptop]> takes about 3 gours
<Brad[Laptop]> hours*
<Brad[Laptop]> But its all automated so I just sit back and relax.
<[SWAG]Haku> Hell, I never even knew about swag until after SWAG came to be
<Brad[Laptop]> and wait.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Brad[Laptop] cool but i guess you already own the materials/tools to do that
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: How much do 3D printers cost nowadays?
<cachi01> YOLO: You obviously love octavia
<Brad[Laptop]> TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah lol
<Barbetos> Oh wow. They litterally made Allatum just like Dahaka and Zurvan.
<Brad[Laptop]> AJIsAwesome I got mine for $820 with shipping and taxes
<Barbetos> I think I like.
<Brad[Laptop]> but it was a 13 week wait.
<d3rb> cachi01, i am all for yolo if thats what it shall be known as from onw
<[SWAG]Haku> cachi01 I fear that for when OCty sings in S3
<sub06905> 3D printers?
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: Okay.
<[SWAG]Haku> Everyone will be saying YOLO
<Brad[Laptop]> AJIsAwesome I want to get one that does color :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Brad[Laptop] you can paint them manually :p
<[SWAG]Haku> Anyways
<d3rb> wouldnt it almost be more cost effective to paint it tourself though Brad[Laptop] ?
<[SWAG]Haku> back to HAku
<Bronysith> i want a new phoenix wright game to come out already
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: yes?
<Brad[Laptop]> TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah but then i have to mix stuff to get the right shades and I know it wont be exactly how i want it
<cachi01> Bronysith: just wait for 6 motnhs
<Brad[Laptop]> Im quite particular about how things look lol
<d3rb> do colour 3d printers exist??
<Brad[Laptop]> d3rb yes
<[SWAG]Haku> The only reason I still have SWAG on my name is because I am the last memebr of the original SWAG clan type thing
<d3rb> cool
<Bronysith> d3rb: they cost a shitload
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Brad[Laptop] well if you keep trying until you get it right you could sell those you know
<Brad[Laptop]> I dont think im worried about cost effective at this point, haha.
<Bronysith> d3rb: also there is such a thing as fully 4d print, but again, expensive
<[SWAG]Haku> that is why Haku has the SWAG
<d3rb> 4d.....?
<Brad[Laptop]> TheGreatAndPowerfulT you think people would like larger plastic ones?
<d3rb> it prints in other dimensions?
<Brad[Laptop]> I like my 3d printed models more than the actual toys as they are more accurate to the character models
<[SWAG]Haku> I know perfectly how the actual swag thing started and how its used by idiots today
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if i know anything about this fandom they would buy pretty much everything
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<Brad[Laptop]> thats true
<[SWAG]Haku> mhm
<d3rb> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, as long as it looks like g4 they will buy it
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: didnt swag start with old spice?
<[SWAG]Haku> No
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> still plastic ones may get you in trouble with hasbro unless they are OC's and never characters from the show
<Brad[Laptop]> I just dont like how the toys are not accurate to the show models
<d3rb> Brad[Laptop], ikr
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: well after those commercials is when i noticed a huge rise in people saying swag
<[SWAG]Haku> swag started a long time ago when people would advertise gay orgies with the term swag, which meant Secretly We Are Gay

<J_E_Smith71> Okay souh guys, there's going to be a shirt of Shining Armor saying, "That's right." very soon. :monster:Anyway, so far today has been fun. Went to Brony Breakdown (wooo!) I was front and center. Which was fun because I'm so damn short so it was nice to be able to actually SEE! I really enjoyed it. Saberspark and Paleo did a great job. SoGreat was so funny. I really got a kick out of the interview.
<taoumi> xD sure i'm alwase good to make another twi.
<J_E_Smith71> Then it was TIME TO STAND IN LINE :Pthe line was ridiculously long but not as bad as Bronycon. Plus it was moving rather well... but after about an hour, some staff came by and told us that if we had vouchers for just Tara Strong, we'd have to come back because her session was ending... so about half the line left.
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: I would recommend telling him to change the OC's hair and tail. Black and red is used WAY to often in OC's nowasays.
<Brad[Laptop]> Saturn what does OC stand for (lol feel like an idiot asking this question)
<PeachStreak> Meanwhile: im no pro so dont be hatin plz
<Brad[Laptop]> original character?
<MirrorImage> yes
<[SWAG]Haku> Well, Haku shall turn in for the night
<Spectrum_Rush> taoumi: what about another Luna after Bronysiths ?
<Meanwhile> Bloody hell that sentence gave me an aneurysm.
<PeachStreak> the deed is done i cant erase
<[SWAG]Haku> So long Everypony, until we meet again
<J_E_Smith71> HEN... a moment later another guy came by and said Tara was going to stay for ANOTHER session. ^-^ So basically I was happy cause I'd have 3 out of my 4 autographs by the end of it. the line moved... slowly but surely and it was still faster than Bronycon. Eventually they split the line into two. The Tara Strong line and the not Tara Strong line... so Appleshy who got in line about an hour after I did ended up getting in the room before me.
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile - it ain't over yet
<d3rb> bye [SWAG]Haku
<Bronysith> tl dr
<Meanwhile> J_E_Smith71: Tl;dr.
<AJIsAwesome> [SWAG]Haku: Bye. :)
<Bronysith> night [SWAG]Haku
<J_E_Smith71> Okay maybe I should link the posts...but I can't because of stream
<taoumi> pleese send me something on my email or deviant art
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348967702365.jpg
<thelonepony> night [SWAG]Haku
<taoumi> i can't keep up with this chat
<Meanwhile> Wrekception.
<LadyCanary> O___O
<thelonepony> StreamCeption
<d3rb> keep it like that
<taoumi> l33tmaster85@hotmail.com or http://taoumi.deviantart.com/
<RaveBrony> Hey someone help me out! If I buy "Total War: Medival 2" NOW, do I still get the 'King of Scotland Cape"? O_O
<Spectrum_Rush> to Da
<Spectrum_Rush> or email
<Meanwhile> I have no idea.
<Phase4> BERRYPUNCH
<J_E_Smith71> Basically she was saying that the lines of Tara and diMaggio were so big they had to split them in half
<Phase4> Y U DISAPERA
<RaveBrony> I want iiitttt
<Phase4> :<
<scout19_tf2> dat backround music
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Just letting you know, he should change the color and hair of his OC. Black and Red have been overused way too much in OC making. Also, change the eye color. I see red too much in many OCs. That's just my opinion, though.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RaveBrony maybe
<CrimsonPhoenix> to everyone who hasn't yet to make OC's http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/348/1/f/dan_vs_original_characters_by_mixermike622-d4j2jzy.png
<alexxm> night guys
<RaveBrony> Oh my GOD, my prayers were answered :D Not only a cape, but for Demoman!
<scout19_tf2> nite alexxm
<Meanwhile> Democape.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> should be for medic .... i would paint it
<AJIsAwesome> Night, alexxm :)
<J_E_Smith71> But she had to stand in line for like 45 minutes for John Dimaggio.
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: he says he'll make a new OC cause i cant erase colored pencil
<LadyCanary> I wonder what Wreky is drawing :o
<RaveBrony> Also, is it only 'Gen' quality that is untradeable?
<Kinixys> Nite {swa...
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Okay. Just letting you know. :)
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: all the bad colour combination sense
<J_E_Smith71> And the reason was this:
<J_E_Smith71> anyway, FINALLY the line was moving... and a staffer came out and I asked if John just had a lot of people in there or something and he said the problem was (okay get this)... that some people were having like 10 minute or longer conversations with him. They said they're trying to "limit" the conversations... are you kidding me? I just stood in one spot for 45 minutes so someone could tell John Demaggio their life story?
*Spectrum_Rush voms
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it will become tradable eventually
<thelonepony> night alexxm
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Didn't want to hurt your feelings. :)
<RaveBrony> :o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> like many promo items
<J_E_Smith71> Okay should have broken it up again
<Bronysith> TL DR
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RaveBrony http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/King_of_Scotland_Cape
<d3rb> CrimsonPhoenix, ocs in a nutshell
<CrimsonPhoenix> d3rb, pretty much
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: you didnt criticism is welcome just dont be to harsh
<PeachStreak> yours is fine
<AJIsAwesome> Well, most of them, IMO.
<RaveBrony> O_O
<J_E_Smith71> "anyway, FINALLY the line was moving... and a staffer came out and I asked if John just had a lot of people in there or something and he said the problem was (okay get this)"
<Phase4> oh come on, the vps is down AGAIN
<RaveBrony> I can still buy one of those games and get it
<Phase4> this is unacceptable
<SpeedyBolt> Time to A-Rank Grand Metropolis
<AJIsAwesome> Some OC's I find pretty creative. It's just that the majority are incredibly horrible.
<RaveBrony> Which one? Medieval II: Total War or Total War Battles: SHOGUN?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep until october 1 it seems
<J_E_Smith71> "that some people were having like 10 minute or longer conversations with him. They said they're trying to "limit" the conversations... are you kidding me? I just stood in one spot for 45 minutes so someone could tell John Demaggio their life story?"
<Spectrum_Rush> http://obstacol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Didnt-READ.gif
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Can't agree more
<Meanwhile> Most OC's are utterly terrible.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dunno what class you play the most
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: is PeachStreak creative
<spitfirecolt> whose this guy
<Meanwhile> And as always, anyone who makes their OC an alicorn needs to be kicked in the teeth.
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: Sure. I like the name. :)
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Couldn't agree more.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh wait both give you the same
<d3rb> ^
<RaveBrony> I play Demoman the most <3
<PeachStreak> AJIsAwesome: read the journal part and it tells how she came to be
<Bronysith> welp im off to bed, gnight you crazy bastards
<spitfirecolt> my oc is an alicorn
<DB_Brony> Chat is now Agrees!
<d3rb> take it easy Bronysith
<AJIsAwesome> PeachStreak: If you want some advice on its backstory, talk to me on dA. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> anyways Pony color aside PeachStreak you might need this http://derpy.me/hGR-T
<Bronysith> spitfirecolt: your creativity level, ZERO
<RaveBrony> Too bad i missed out on grabbing 'A Rather Festive Tree' before it started going up...
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Bronysith :)
*Meanwhile kicks spitfirecolt in the teeth.
<spitfirecolt> just kidding its a unicorn
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well if you only want the item go for the cheap one medieval II
<CrimsonPhoenix> You can somewhat draw but you do have some anatomy problem
<cachi01> i was searching for bad OCS and i found this one. but imo its good and creative http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/299/2/1/mlp_oc_pony___gear_hawk_by_metadragonart-d485lei.jpg
<spitfirecolt> around the age of the cmc
<DB_Brony> I never understood the alure of having an OC
<Sumica> 00,10that looks like a Shizu Vivi friendship
<Spectrum_Rush> I spy a shizuvi
<RaveBrony> but thats the difficult choice. The 6 year old game for $2.50.... or the new game for $4
<LadyCanary> :3
<LadyCanary> AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: It's an interesting OC. It's not that bad, IMO. :)
<Meanwhile> Eh.

<Wrek> 05basically you cant link iamges of it BaconMane
<Shizuka> 13you gon get sued
<Wrek> 05cant eve ntalk about it
<RaveBrony> Then theres the thot of "People are still able to buy it, knowing the item you get" So... will I just be able to easily buy it with metal/keys.
<Kinixys> cachi01: Added as much as possible.. that has to be a parody.
<J_E_Smith71> Kinixys: I didn't go. I was telling a story of Dashell (Admin of EqF)'s experience with the autograph lines
<BaconMane> 0,5Plenty of people have been doing it all around
<Shizuka> 13i want his toaster
<Meanwhile> First rule of NDA is you don't talk about NDA.
<Wrek> 05plenty of people are breakign the NDA then
<J_E_Smith71> She was moved around like three times
<Spectrum_Rush> BaconMane: YOU BROKE THE LAAAAW
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: That doesn't justify it, though. :D
<Kinixys> J_E_Smith71: Ah, my bad.
<cachi01> oooh BaconMane is alpha testing? soo how is the game so far?
<Wrek> 05you gona jump off the cliff with them aswell LC?
<Wrek> 05:o
<BaconMane> 0,5Hey now

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> BaconMane i do read agreemnts on betas
<RaveBrony> Im supposed to be saving the $15 in my Steam wallet for the next sale.... now this...
<killerpony7733> BaconMane Actually it's common knowledge what they mostly entail
<MirrorImage> Wrek - it's their fault for not making the NDA mind-blowingly obvious then
<LadyCanary> Dat sexi Shizu
<Wrek> 05MirrorImage: not really
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MirrorImage nope
<Shizuka> 13aaaaack i do not think i saved the last one ><
<Spectrum_Rush> dat classic shizu sketch
<Brad[Laptop]> working on a copter… http://i.imgur.com/GdLc7.jpg
<Lyra`> wrek~
<MirrorImage> Wrek - the purpose of an NDA is that you want to keep things secret
<Lyra`> about that commission!
<MirrorImage> if you want to keep things secret, make it painfully obvious you want that
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: nice.
<BaconMane> 0,5Oh well, I saw other people doing it for a while now and I haven't seen any of them taken down
<cachi01> Brad[Laptop]: looks cool. now add some kerbals!
<Brad[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/VqHnS.jpg
<MirrorImage> if they didn't make it painfully obvious that there was an NDA, it's their own fault if things get leaked
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: For now...........
<Brad[Laptop]> with landing gear
<d3rb> Brad[Laptop], dat carbon fibre
<Brad[Laptop]> d3rb it is :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i dunno i buy the collection cause i like RTS and becuase medic item looks cool
<d3rb> tasty...and expensive
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait Legend of Equestria isn't in Closed beta
<Brad[Laptop]> very expensive
<Sumica> 00,10they cant take it down because they are dead BaconMane
<RaveBrony> I saw those too, and i love them! But... i never play Medic.
<Sumica> 00,10you are next
<AJIsAwesome> ^ :O
<RaveBrony> I dont even know which gun to use for him ffs
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MirrorImage keep thinking that and you will get sued one day
<Sumica> 00,10they are realy cracking down now a days
<PeachStreak> black and red OC's bucked in the face
<MirrorImage> TheGreatAndPowerfulT - if i sign something with an NDA, i expect them to make that NDA extremely clear
<MirrorImage> you should've seen the 3 pages of NDA i had to sign when i had an internship with Dollar Bank in Pittsburgh
<Shizuka> 13i still want his toaster
<d3rb> MirrorImage, you should understand it before you sign it
<RaveBrony> The problem is, I dont like these types of games at all... But i would give the newer one a chance.
<MirrorImage> d3rb - "should"
<MirrorImage> welcome to the Internet
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: so you can toast toast?

<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Mer?
<MadSurge> DerpyMuffins: Shizu and Vivi's OCs
<scout19_tf2> holy crap Reikim
*AJIsAwesome spots Reikim
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Mer? The hell does that mean?
<Sumica> 00,10so unless you were useing a diffrent name that day it must have been in manechat
<Kinixys> This song reminds me of that relic Alpha Centauri. Firaxis really should remake that.
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: elf, basically
<DerpyMuffins> Now I remember the....brown mane
<MadSurge> Hey Sumica!
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: ...what?
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: it's from skyrim
<Sumica> 00,10hi MadSurge
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: thought so, yeah probably manechat
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: It's like a meow, but shorter and more questioning. :|
<kirzstryfe> everyone has seen Meanwhile's self-portrait right? http://i.imgur.com/0C2rJ.jpg?1
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Right, well despite having 5, I don't speak cat.
<MadSurge> kirzstryfe: most likely :D
<AJIsAwesome> kirzstryfe: :D
<thelonepony> kirzstryfe :D
<Meanwhile> I'm never going to see the end of that am I kirz.
<Reikim> ...Meanwhile has cats?
<kirzstryfe> eeeenope :3
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Pft, fine. I was asking "whaddya mean, one-sided? What are you talking about? O.o"
<Meanwhile> Reikim: 5 cats a husky 3 chickens and 3 Degu.
<CriticKitten> Husky. <3
<Spectrum_Rush> ^
<kirzstryfe> what's a Degu?
<CriticKitten> Husky is best dog breed
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: mer is elves in general. just different prefixes. falmer, dunmer and so on
<Dark_Horst> skyrim
<Sumica> 00,10kinda scarry when logfiles are aproching the 1gig mark
<Reikim> ...Huh. Never figured you for an animals person.
<CriticKitten> All other dog breeds wish they were as baws as huskies
<Reikim> No wait it makes perfect sense.
<scout19_tf2> loto pets CriticKitten
<scout19_tf2> :D baws
<Meanwhile> A degu is http://derpy.me/rkOlA
<Meanwhile> kirz ^
<kirzstryfe> so... land-squirrel?
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst: Wat. There's another meaning to my favorite term? PISS OFF SKYRIM, I HAD IT FIRST.
<Meanwhile> They're more like little chinchillas.
<Reikim> Squirrels live on land already.
<Everlasting_Joy> CriticKitten: Funny, I think german shepards beg to differ.
<kirzstryfe> squirrels are tree-based
<kirzstryfe> :P
<Reikim> But trees are land-based.
<Dark_Horst> CriticKitten: seing how it's sthe same lore than every other elder scrolls game, i highly doubt that^^
<Reikim> Therefore, squirrels are land-based.
<kirzstryfe> distantly related to fluttershies
<Reikim> Fluttershies are land-based too.
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst: Don't care. I totally had it first. I'll paw-wave your logic by claiming that I can see the future.
<Dark_Horst> okay then
<CiderIsForDrinking> Did I miss Allegr0 and Gigabit's stream?
<LadyCanary> Nope.
<LadyCanary> Twas cancelled.
<AJIsAwesome> CiderIsForDrinking: Cancelled.
<J_E_Smith71> CiderIsForDrinking: It was canned tonight
<kirzstryfe> that's like saying pirates are land-based because taverns are land-based, when we all know that pirates are water-based
<CiderIsForDrinking> Ah
<thelonepony> CiderIsForDrinking cancelled :(
<Dark_Horst> LadyCanary: but why?
<Everlasting_Joy> CiderIsForDrinking: They couldn't do it tonight, canceled due to technical difficulties.
<kirzstryfe> the pirate's natural enemy, the ninja, is air-based
<LadyCanary> Yar
<CiderIsForDrinking> So who's streaming now?
<scout19_tf2> man im hungry im gonna make me a sandvich
<AJIsAwesome> HAR FIDDLE DEE DEE
<AJIsAwesome> CiderIsForDrinking: Wrek.
<Reikim> ...Okay kirz I concede.
<RDash5000> wazzup bronystate?
<kirzstryfe> so Wrek, what exactly is Vivi doing with that Shizu there? :3
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RDash5000 :)
<Meanwhile> kirz: Trying to look like it'd work?
<RDash5000> dat art

<Panda|Homework> Sumica O_o there wasnt? Nvm. then :3
<MirrorImage> Meanwhile - no, that'll just make BaconMane seem like a creep / stalker
<MirrorImage> or is that otherwise accurate?
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: guessing Chase was part of the original random?
<Meanwhile> MirrorImage: He's...not in this image.
<Sumica> 00,10MirrorImage, seemlike?

<cachi01> and some shields
<DerpyMuffins> We listen to Wrek's Viking playlist?
<Meanwhile> Been running?
<MirrorImage> DerpyMuffins - i would describe it as "Klingon," but it's roughly the same, isn't it?
<LadyCanary> His MegaMetal playlist to be exact.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> playing PIU
<Kandarihu> Viking playlist? That's an interesting way of describing it
<Meanwhile> I'll just pretend I know what that is.
<Dovah> lol thanks to Wrek I just remembered, I used this song in my WW1 presentation for Social Studies :P
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<MirrorImage> Kandarihu - but no less accurate
<DerpyMuffins> You are lucky you are american
<MirrorImage> hmm?
<DerpyMuffins> Your history doesnt expand back for thousand of years
<MirrorImage> oh, on the contrary
<MirrorImage> we're a melting pot
<MirrorImage> we have history EVERYWHERE
<MirrorImage> it's like a family tree
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DHtAljhEI0&feature=player_detailpage#t=33s
<Everlasting_Joy> History, history everywhere!
<Lyra`> that honestly the first time ive seen someone post "stop fucking my pony, seriously!"
<MirrorImage> "My father is from Germany" *append German history"
<MirrorImage> "Well mine was African" *append African history*
<Meanwhile> The more you know.
<Reikim> So basically DDR's foreign cousin.
<DerpyMuffins> Yea well Im English-French so its double the history for me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so basicly DDR big brother
<MirrorImage> DerpyMuffins - and the funny thing is that when we get taught history, we're effectively being taught British History right up until the 1600s-ish
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> way harder too
<DerpyMuffins> Just me or did chat die?
<MirrorImage> more or less
<thelonepony> napping
<Lightningwolf> no
<MirrorImage> napping, yeah
<MirrorImage> chat is old
<Everlasting_Joy> I have no idea what you guys were talkinga bout, so I didn't say anything.
<MirrorImage> Everlasting_Joy - half the times we don't even know what we're talking about
<Kinixys> Hey guys, what kind of music would Spike listen to
*Dovah laughs maniacally at DerpyMuffins' expense.
<Kinixys> ?
<MirrorImage> it's amazing how many tangents a conversation can go
*AJIsAwesome zzzzzzzzz.......
<Everlasting_Joy> MirrorImage: :D.
<Everlasting_Joy> MirrorImage: Isn't it?
<MirrorImage> we can go from "Which is better, Apples or Oranges" to Godwins Law in about 5 minutes if we really tried
<Ryunosuke> i want a tangerine
<MirrorImage> although in fairness, *that* might be a loaded situation
<AJIsAwesome> Just letting you know, I'm napping. :D
<CiderIsForDrinking> Kinixys: Toddler tunes? Considering he's not that old
<Everlasting_Joy> MirrorImage: Only Nazi's would bring up oranges.
*p4ngya is eating a tangerine <.<
*MirrorImage is eating Ice Cream
<MirrorImage> *win*
*Ryunosuke steals p4ngya's tangerine
<p4ngya> nuuuuuuuu
*Ryunosuke replaces said tangerine with a lemon :)
<Ryunosuke> hmm
*p4ngya is okay with this
<Ryunosuke> rhubarb is also good
<Kinixys> CiderIsForDrinking: Really? He doesn't ACT that young. How about jazz?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> DDR is most know in Europe while PIU is more famous in mexico and japan for some reason
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CiderIsForDrinking> Kinixys: Jazz would probably fit him
<MirrorImage> ( Everlasting_Joy - this is exactly what i mean. We just went from American History to Favorite Foods without even having to touch the Boston Tea Party)
<MirrorImage> in about 2 steps
<Everlasting_Joy> MirrorImage: I know :).

<LadyCanary> Wrek, you put so much detail into your art, even the little things. So wonderful.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> deal with it that's as far as recent years, the reason why DDR is still most know in japan is because it made by konami

<Reikim> But it's free for me and that's all that counts.
<Spectrum_Rush> MirrorImage: if it exists it will be ponified is rule 34.2
<DerpyMuffins> Damn
<Everlasting_Joy> donutpop365: "Inhailing is Magic" that sounds like a durg promotion.

<twilight_sprinkle> nonve of you can still beat my 3 straight years of the same nightmare

<pinkiespice> cachi01: i was watching the season finially of doctor who
<AJIsAwesome> AdamTheDuck: :I
<LightTrooper105> AdamTheDuck im not a food D:
<cachi01> pinkiespice: oh
<flutterchu> Firey: that really hurt me deep down inside.....
<Shizuka> 13oh he is buckling up
<Ninjazz> Hey LightTrooper105.
<AJIsAwesome> People are friends, not food.
<Shizuka> 13and shizu's confusion from our airings earlier is resolved
<Meanwhile> What were you confused about?
<pinkiespice> cachi01: I would tell you who, but spoilsers. :U
<cachi01> troll
<Shizuka> 13i always thought dent was unbuckling to get out of the car, but then the shot changes without showing him getting out
<d3rb> why would you not wear a seatbelt? is it an american thing?
<cachi01> pinkiespice: i dont watch dr who anyway lol
<Meanwhile> Ah.
<Kimori> Ive recently had a desire to play final fantasy NES
<Barbetos> Honestly I think Dent has been wanting to die the whole time he is doing this crap.
<flutterchu> time is the biggest key to change the world
<Kimori> I watched a whole playthrough of the game on youtube, it looks fun but real hard
<cachi01> that or a keyblade :I
<Shizuka> 13d3rb: well in the backseat you'll hit the front anyway, probably is an american thing
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Meanwhile> I figured the biggest key is the one used to turn Big Ben.
<cachi01> secret santa xd
<Shizuka> 13unless you're in the center, you in the back won't be the one flying through a windshield without seatbelt
<d3rb> it must be, i cant be in a car without one
<Cades> I never even knew there was an ff nes game
<jffry890> but you still risk being ejected
<Kimori> really?
<Kimori> But dont you have an nes?
<cachi01> i want!
<d3rb> no seatbelt is more unsafe in nearly all instances
<Cades> yeah, but I don't really have that many games
<d3rb> anyway whatever, roadsafety is boring
<cachi01> all dem steves
<Kimori> what games do you have for it?
<Shizuka> 13i do when i'm in the front seat, and obviously if driving
<Shizuka> 13but backseat usually not
<cachi01> 4182
<Cades> smb 1 2 and 3, rbi baseball or something, a hockey game, an olyimpics game
<DaringDerpy> stop using my ringtone in movies! :[
<Cades> some helicopter game

<Hat> Oh well
<Kimori> so you have an nes and a ps3?
<Ninjazz> still ded.

<Meanwhile> Probably not.
<Cades> and a ps2
<thelonepony> Jocker all the way
<cachi01> chuckles will kill batman
<Shizuka> 13and then everypony missed the fiddler on the roof reference
<jffry890> whats with his retarded voice
<sub06905> batman dies and robin saves the day
<Meanwhile> We got the line for that referance after you said that shizu.
<Meanwhile> So you pretty much baked it.
<Hat> I'm glad there are subtitles I couldn't understand Batman in this movie
<Shizuka> 13but i am bronystate baker

<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: If you subscribe to the newsletter, you are able to participate in a survey that lets you pick an A movie, B movie and a Pony episode. On BMN, the survey answers are then compilated and chosen at random. Whoever gets picked gets their movie/pony episode. However, there are some clauses that prevent you from chosing the same movie/episode over and over again. :)

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lunar_Brony: A lot of today's 'new-style' kids shows focus on idiotic comedy because they're easy to do and nets them the most popularity rather than meaningful content mixed in with some thought-out humor.

<Lunar_Brony> NewSuperBronyU therefore we should blame lazy writers and creators. What about shows that just don't have a meaning of existence? I can name quite a few off the top of my head, and they don't even try to be funny with meaningless humour

<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02gg :)
<Buytoast> damn
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: My mom and I went to India to visit family, and we went for two weeks, so I brought my GameCube. My mom told me to leave it there. I am not very happy about that.
<Meanwhile> Mister gay man watch.
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill wha-who-why-WHAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
<Lunar_Brony> my parents don't appreciate old technology as much as me. They wanted to sell my Gamecube. I practically lectured them on how much it meant to me
<ShadowQuill> Now I have a gold brick worth 20 grand and I hid it in my house.
<ShadowQuill> Life's insane.
<Lunar_Brony> I'm insane
<Life> That's not very nice! I'm not insane!
<thelonepony> we're insane :3
<Lunar_Brony> I saw you change your nick ShadowQuill
<ShadowQuill> OH, LIFE! I never said you were insane!
<Lunar_Brony> I still have a PM tab open
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: Sneaky sneaky...
<ShadowQuill> Lunar_Brony: BUT HOW
<Lunar_Brony> why is there no emote for rolling your eyes?
<ShadowQuill> Because that would give you the power of sarcasm
<Sylandest> dat back and forth dominating conversation
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: I use the :P for sarcasm sometimes.
<ShadowQuill> But really, Life can be crazy at times.
<Derpy_Hooves> DAMN}

<Life> Yeah, you heard Life, ShadowQuill!
<Lunar_Brony> ShadowQuill Life dude, you're making yourself look sane.
<Vordox> Buytoast: Going to make your OWN toast and not bought one?

<Life> ShadowQuill, don't make me get Death
<Lunar_Brony> dat one-sided conversation
<Meanwhile> Forever alone guy.
<pony18836> I think I killed Life
<Lunar_Brony> Life, Death, and ShadowQuill are the same user. So is pony18836
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/051114.gif
<Meanwhile> I think you should stop playing with yourself in public.
<pony18836> Lunar_Brony: YOU LIAR

<Meanwhile> Do chat a favour and don't come back flut...damn I missed.
<Meanwhile> Oh no there he is.
<Buytoast> my ultimate plan failed
<Meanwhile> Do chat a favour and don't come back flutterchu.
<Buytoast> goddamn jigglypuff
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile that insult was bad and you should feel bad. Now STFU and GTFO
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02gg :)
<Derpy_Hooves> not cool...
<flutterchu> much better........anyway by every- *looks at Meanwhile's chat* ;_;......oh....okay
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<ShadowQuill> Meanwhile: Do the chat a favor?! What did flutterchu do to you?
<thelonepony> ^
<Meanwhile> Annoyed me.
*Lunar_Brony hugs flutterchu
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/051127.jpg
*Lunar_Brony and slaps Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Lunar_Brony I don't know who you are at all so I'm just going to a wild guess and assume you're a spazz.
<Buytoast> don't worry meanwhile, i support you
<Meanwhile> I don't need support but I appreciate it nonetheless.
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile I'm Canadian_Brony, Science_Brony, and Zombie_Brony. I have 4 aliases. We got tied together by SB about a month back
<Meanwhile> Oh so I was right. You're a spazz
<Lunar_Brony> you didn't exactly enjoy it
<Meanwhile> Guess I win some point.
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/051205.jpg
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile I'm not a spazz. I'm insane
<ShadowQuill> Meanwhile: If your brother annoyed you, would you throw him out of the house with no resources left to fend on his own?
<Lunar_Brony> there IS a difference!
<Meanwhile> No you're a spazz.
<Lunar_Brony> prove it
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You're supposed to let it charge up Buytoast :/
<Meanwhile> Don't need to, everything you type spells it out pretty well.
<Lunar_Brony> example?
<Meanwhile> Claiming to be insane, that's something a spazz would do.
<Lunar_Brony> define "spazz"
<Meanwhile> Because you think you're just so out of line with the norm that you must be special.
<Meanwhile> When in reality you're just like a lot of people, namely the rest of the spazz community.
<rising> I kinda half to agree with Lunar_Brony
<Meanwhile> have*
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/051226.jpg
<rising> Meanwhile: whatever
<Lunar_Brony> we're all insane here, there is no such thing as "normal", and I like to throw muffins
<Meanwhile> half is fifty percent of something.
<Buytoast> man i have no idea how wario works
<Lunar_Brony> half, 50%, 1/2, all the same
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: I love that last panel. :D
<Meanwhile> See at least he understands that.
<Lunar_Brony> "he" has a name
<Meanwhile> As far as I care your name is mud.
<Laurayne> Me Too AJIsAwesome
<rising> what do you mean by "he"
<Meanwhile> The spazz.
<Lunar_Brony> Meanwhile I am aware that "mud" spelled backwards is "dum". I have taste in what I watch
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02gg :)
<Derpy_Hooves> WHAT\
<Ninjazz> I didn't know it had two z's.
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<Lunar_Brony> neither did I
<rising> and what does gg mean
<Lunar_Brony> good game
<AJIsAwesome> rising: Good game
<Meanwhile> Well now you do, consider yourself somewhat more educated.
<rising> oh okay then
<Ninjazz> The more you know! ~*
<rising> whatever
<AJIsAwesome> G I JOE!!!!!!
<Lunar_Brony> also, I'm not entirely sure who Meanwhile is referring to. I almost completely lost interest in the conversation and I'm only replying to keep him entertainee
<Lunar_Brony> *entertained
<rising> why do i predict flutterchu wont come in weeks
<Lunar_Brony> I'm not even sure if he's being entertained
<Meanwhile> We should be so lucky.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Part 2 :)
<rising> Meanwhile: T_T
<Ninjazz> Flutterwho?
<Lunar_Brony> Thousand Year Door
<Lunar_Brony> /)^3^(\
<Buytoast> i hear that meanwhile
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060206.jpg
<Lunar_Brony> Laurayne :D
<Meanwhile> I used to be entertained being here but then a mass influx of stupid hit it.
<sub06905> NewSuperBronyU: how far are you?
<Lunar_Brony> pfft, who watched the intro amiright?
<rising> so you all said that you like flutterchu when caramel told her/hm to leave, but you all secretly hate him/her
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02sub06905: Near the beginning :)
<Ninjazz> I used to talk to much in here, then I got lurker'd.
<Buytoast> i never said i liked anyone
<Lunar_Brony> O_________O
<Meanwhile> I don't know if EVERYONE hates flutterchu, but I do.
<sub06905> ah im on the second crystal star :
<Buytoast> and frankly the guy doesn't know when to quit
<sub06905> :)
<Lunar_Brony> you've got a loooooooong way to got bro
<Lunar_Brony> I'm already inside the door on my second
<Meanwhile> It's hard to enjoy anything when there're people you hate all over the place.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I beat this game twice so far :)
<Ninjazz> God I know that feel.
<Lunar_Brony> ^\
<Lunar_Brony> -_(\
<rising> Meanwhile: you know flutterchu's a bit emotioal i predict you just caused him/her a sucide
<Meanwhile> rising: then I consider my good deed for the day accomplished.
<twilight_sprinkle> sucks to be you, Meanwhile.
<AJIsAwesome> Look, I have to put this out. For people who may not know, flutterchu has been known for spamming quotes, "attention grabbing" and various other things. I have to admit, those things are VERY annoying to me when it's done xcessively, but I don't hate him. I just wish he'd stop and realize what he's doing is a bit too much.
<Ninjazz> ... -_(\
<Buytoast> he won't stop and realize
<Buytoast> that's the issue
<Meanwhile> I know it does twilight_sprinkle, I'm me.
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060314.jpg Something Similar Happened To Me With This Movie
<Lunar_Brony> sounds like me in my early days of the chat room
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome tbh i think the fellow is a bit, well, not to offennd, but autistic
<twilight_sprinkle> he seems to always be in his world
<Meanwhile> So flutterchu is a twat, glad we could sort that out.
<rising> twilight_sprinkle: what do you mean by autistic
<twilight_sprinkle> one sec i need to refresh
<rising> im waiting
<twilight_sprinkle> what i mean is that hes always saying things completely unrelated to anyhting going on, and his replies make no sense
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Cut out all the hate everypony :(
<Lunar_Brony> that defenitely sounds like me in my early days of the chat room
<Lunar_Brony> k
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should drop this before it gets out of hand. :S
<twilight_sprinkle> i just think hes a bit nutty, so not really a bad person, just a bit, nutty
<Meanwhile> He's a twonk.
<Lunar_Brony> SB laid the law already
<rising> twilight_sprinkle: i dont think he's not stopping and realizing
<Lunar_Brony> now have a muffin
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: im not hating, to the contrary im defending him, in fact i already prevented him getting banned once
*Lunar_Brony throws a muffin into the chat
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: No stylish moves?
<rising> twilight_sprinkle: I think he/her trying to make everyone realize
<Lunar_Brony> man, you gotta have STYLE
<Lunar_Brony> STYLE is everything!
<Meanwhile> You prevented him getting banned? What'd you do that for? Could've cleaned chat up a bit.
<AJIsAwesome> LOVE the music in this game.
<twilight_sprinkle> because i rarely want anyone to get banned
<Lunar_Brony> and there we go
<Lunar_Brony> STYLE
<rising> twilight_sprinkle: i dot see your name as the staff
<twilight_sprinkle> and like i said, i dont think he understands what hes doing, so i cant hate him for being annoying unintentionally
<Meanwhile> Because he's not staff.
<Derpy_Hooves> man, you are not good at paper mario: TTYD unless you can defeat bonetail as a level 1
<twilight_sprinkle> rising: doesnt mean i cant argue with them.
<Lunar_Brony> how did he get so many items?
<AJIsAwesome> rising: he doesn't have to be part of the staff to defend his opinions. :S
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lunar_Brony: Bought them before the Bandit could steal my coins :P
<Derpy_Hooves> NewSuperBronyU
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont really care whos staff or not, i'll express my opinion the same
<Meanwhile> On here though you do have to be part of the staff to not get kicked for it.
<rising> dont you argue to him/her to stop tattle tailing AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Did you find the bandiT?
<Lunar_Brony> NewSuperBronyU nice
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02AJIsAwesome: Ran in to me in the beginning :)
<Derpy_Hooves> NewSuperBronyU: you cannot call yourself good at this game unless you can kill bonetail while at level 1
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Okay. :0
<AJIsAwesome> *:)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Okie, then I'm not good at this game \:3/
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome the bandit will ALWAYS steal half your coins
<Derpy_Hooves> and YES it is possible
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: I know. :P
<Derpy_Hooves> also Lunar_Brony still annoys me
<Buytoast> GET BACK EHRE YOU LITTLE LIGHTBULB HEADED SLUG
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Just asking if he FOUnd him, that's all.
<AJIsAwesome> *FOUND
<Lunar_Brony> NewSuperBronyU that's why you have the chat to assisst you decision making, but still allowing you to have your own opinion based on personal strategies, skills, and reflexes
<Ninjazz> Oh lawdy. It's getting personal in here too. -_-
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060529.jpg
<sub06905> NewSuperBronyU: just wait until you try the 100 pit trials
<Meanwhile> So does Laurayne ever actually say anything or just link to a mediocre webcomic?
<Lunar_Brony> ooooh, those are fun sub06905
<rising> Meanwhile: if you cant ignore ponies chat why dont you just go on a diffrent server if all youre gonna do is insult them and not ignore them
<Buytoast> so far it's just been links
<Laurayne> I Talk :(
<Lunar_Brony> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^^
<sub06905> ^^^^
<Ninjazz> C-c-c-c-combo breaker.
<Meanwhile> I've been here for over a year rising I'm not about to leave just because it happens to have gotten particularly stupid in here.
<Lunar_Brony> ah yes, the black key that opens the black chest containing the thing that "curses" you
<Lunar_Brony> you have to go through the same process 4 times
<Derpy_Hooves> Lunar_Brony...
<Ninjazz> I still wish I got here sooner.
<AJIsAwesome> Isn't there a theory that the chests are actually the [need Bronystate gold to view this]
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sooo what's on stream ?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02OH NOES
<Lunar_Brony> the same damn key and the same damn chest and the same damn taunting and the same damn music . . . is slightly catchy tbh
<Buytoast> i do like this music
<Ninjazz> Paper Mario I think TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02A CURSE D:
<AJIsAwesome> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door.
<Meanwhile> Oh no it's a sentient jack o'lantern face.
<Derpy_Hooves> Ninjazz: you didn'ty miss much, the only thing you didn't miss is the fact that Lunar_Brony wont quit talking so much :V
<NocturnalBlade> Ninjazz: yea, you are correct ^_^
<rising> Meanwhile: who cares if youve been here for a year flutterchu has been here for a year too
<Ninjazz> Derpy_Hooves, lol.
<Lunar_Brony> Derpy_Hooves sorry :(
<Meanwhile> rising: Pfft, my ass he has.
<rising> Meanwhile: T_T
<Ninjazz> NocturnalBlade, for once I am. :D
<AJIsAwesome> rising: Actualy, he hasn't. He's only been here for a little while.
<Buytoast> flutterchu hasn't been here for a year
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Lunar_Brony> "cursed"
<Buytoast> get your facts straight
<Derpy_Hooves> Lunar_Brony: well the only reason im saying that is the first impression you gave me annoyed me
<Ninjazz> Flutterchu has been here for a month or two at best.
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu says hes been here since a long time ago, but was in ban
<Lunar_Brony> Derpy_Hooves I have been known to give lousy first impressions
<Meanwhile> Lunar_Brony: Probably because you're a spazz.
<Lunar_Brony> one of these days . . .
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I still wish he'd straigten up, it would suck to see him banned, IMO.
<AJIsAwesome> *straighten
<Ninspazz> Hmmm.
<Ninspazz> Not bad.
<Lunar_Brony> ha
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: well if i'm right about him being, yknow, then its kinda doubtful, but ive tried to straighten him ot. ill try some more maybe

<Derpy_Hooves> Meanwhile flutterchu (kxdtjlhvpe@lc27-2-196-676.oc.oc.cox.net) has joined #bronystate rising (kxdtjlhvpe@lc27-2-196-676.oc.oc.cox.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<Lunar_Brony> I couldn't care less
<Meanwhile> I guess technically I was right.
<AJIsAwesome> You've lost ALL my respect (if I had any) of you, flutterchu. That's pathetic.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also passed by teardrop for a while
<Buytoast> wait, so he actually changed his name to talk about himself?
<AJIsAwesome> DOWNRIGHT SAD.
<Buytoast> oh man
<Buytoast> this is spectacular
<Meanwhile> I don't monitor the join/quit feed Derpy_Hooves, I only watch name changes.
<Derpy_Hooves> well he joined under the name rising
<Ninspazz> It was still pretty obvious. :p
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah i suspected he lurked around after he said things he shouldnt have known after leaving
<Meanwhile> Pfft, fair enough.
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome is angry, Meanwhile and Buytoast are amused, I'm laughing my ass off at the chat's reactions
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile want me to warn you next time or just leave you in the blue until the person leaves so you can laugh later ?
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: I'm not angry, just disappointed.
<Lunar_Brony> and not one fuck was given that day!
<Meanwhile> Ah I don't mind whichever T.
<Ninspazz> Ah Meanwhile DGAS anyways. I wouldn't.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<twilight_sprinkle> Lunar_Brony: but you just described that plenty of them were given
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle . . . shut up
<twilight_sprinkle> :<
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Thought he would change, but he didn't. HOW SAD. Even gave him a chance and turned it down.
<Meanwhile> Heh
<Derpy_Hooves> AJIsAwesome: que?
<Laurayne> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/060918.jpg
<Ninspazz> Insert rolled eyes here.
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: flutterchu.
<Derpy_Hooves> what about him?
<twilight_sprinkle> also, cant tell if flutterchu is insane, or more clever than i thought
<Meanwhile> Ah that was funny.
<Ninspazz> Lol. Just wants attention.
<Ninspazz> Takes alot to be legit insane.
<Lunar_Brony> twilight_sprinkle I'd say he's sane
<twilight_sprinkle> although him lurking after leaving was obvious, but still, he acts completely different on his other acc
<Ninspazz> And even more to be clever.
<Lunar_Brony> just sayin'
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: Were you paying attention?
<Derpy_Hooves> nope :V
<NocturnalBlade> ummm, wow i just noticed that its 4 in the morning XD
<Lunar_Brony> it's a long story
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome will tell you it!
<Meanwhile> Still looking for artists on that collab picture thingymabob Derpy_Hooves?
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if hes still lurking though
*Derpy_Hooves pulls up a beanbag chair "yay story time~"
<Lunar_Brony> right? *winkwink nudgenudge*
<Ninspazz> He could be anonpony.
<twilight_sprinkle> prolly not, or the iris people wouldve seen
<Derpy_Hooves> Meanwhile :V
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Random question Derpy_Hooves is hard to manage twentypercentcooler or it's just like one big data base ?
<Derpy_Hooves> how'd ya guess?
<Derpy_Hooves> uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<Meanwhile> Just taking a stab in the dark with a spatula.
<Derpy_Hooves> that is something you want to ask pinkie
<Lunar_Brony> wut?
<Derpy_Hooves> she is the site's coder, im just a mod/admin
<Ninspazz> I should check 20%cooler more often.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mmmm k

<Derpy_Hooves> want me to show you what i do?
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Oh, okay.
<Lunar_Brony> Derpy_Hooves . . . sure. That sounds like a good start
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Basically, rising turned out to be flutterchu and left.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm guessing mod on the forums part ?
<Meanwhile> That thing's kind of soggy...
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome I got that part

*Lunar_Brony is ashamed
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Awesome game \:3/
<sub06905|Gamecube> ^
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905|Gamecube: I never bothered with that. Too much work for me. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: What are you stuck on?
<sub06905|Gamecube> i almost 100% the game, just was missing a few tattles
<Derpy_Hooves> sub06905|Gamecube: i beat it four times, on my third run i did a "no item use" run, on the fourth, i didn't use badges :3
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome one of the bosses in the door. Won't say his name because A) no spoilers and B) I can't remember his name
<Lunar_Brony> ooh, that smarts
<sub06905|Gamecube> SPOILER: You are paper
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Does he pop out of something?
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome he's big, black, and similar to the Chapter 1 boss
<Lunar_Brony> hope that's enough
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Ok.
<sub06905|Gamecube> poor tree ;__;
<AJIsAwesome> Why are you hammering the tree? :S
<Ninjazz> STOP.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo :3

<AJIsAwesome> sub06905|Gamecube: I HATED Corona Mountain. :|
<Lunar_Brony> sub06905|Gamecube I know the feel. Any level where you lose FLUDD pisses me off
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Buytoast> the only non FLUDD level rthat was a pain was the sand bird
<sub06905|Gamecube> ^
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome Corona Mountain was . . . meh. The final boss was just fun
<Buytoast> Corona Mountain wasn't that hard if you jsut used short controlled bursts
<AJIsAwesome> True.
<Buytoast> now that little village with the lava and the chain chomps and shit
<Buytoast> fuck that place
<sub06905|Gamecube> anypony know how much shine sprites in total you have to collect?
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast agreed
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02120
<Buytoast> i think there's like 120 total
<Lunar_Brony> yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Yep, 120.
<Lunar_Brony> 120 to rap it
<Lunar_Brony> I think it's only 80 to beat it
<AJIsAwesome> And the ending for 120 is NOT worth it, IMO.
<AJIsAwesome> I won't say anything because spoilers.
<sub06905|Gamecube> i needi need 25 more
<sub06905|Gamecube> ah
<twilight_sprinkle> sb wants to kill All the bystanders
<Buytoast> you know what game you do need
<Buytoast> Luigi's mansion
<AJIsAwesome> YES
<AJIsAwesome> That game is amazing.
<Lunar_Brony> I remember being stuck early on in the island amusement park. Literally chased down Shadow Mario back-to-back for Yoshi and the two nozels
<Lunar_Brony> Buytoast FUCK YEAH
<AJIsAwesome> Still haven't found everything yet.
<Buytoast> shit, a few months ago my dad opened an old storage locker we were using

<AJIsAwesome> Nice.

<sub06905|Gamecube> and ssbm still sells it at around $20
<sub06905|Gamecube> or more
<Buytoast> hell, they're selling an unopened conker's bad fur day for the n64 too
<AJIsAwesome> Sweet.
<Lunar_Brony> the only game stores around here are EB Games, and both stores cleared their inventory of Gamecube stuff a month ago
<Buytoast> of course, they're charging 50 bucks for it
<AJIsAwesome> That game's fantastic.
<Lunar_Brony> I"m pissed 'cause I'm trying to find NFS: Most Wanted fo the Gamecube
<twilight_sprinkle> NFS: Carbon was the last game i ever bought
<sub06905|Gamecube> found all my n64 wires, controls, and games... but i cant find the console :<

<AJIsAwesome> I actually rage quitted on Fire Emblem because I wasn't doing the mission right. :D
<AJIsAwesome> *Fire Emblem once
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome MK7 is BUCKING AWESOME!!! Car customization, 16 characters, 32 tracks, amazing controls, and online is smooth and fast. Not a hiccup, lag, or sudden disconection so far
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Nice.
<Lunar_Brony> I have nothing negative to say about it
<twilight_sprinkle> MK7?
<AJIsAwesome> Was considering getting another 3DS game.
<Lunar_Brony> other than the lack of GC levels
<Lunar_Brony> 2
<Lunar_Brony> that's it
<sub06905|Gamecube> mortal kombat 7 :3

<sub06905|Gamecube> :<
<Lunar_Brony> speaking of Double Dash . . . only now do I see it.
<AJIsAwesome> I actually prefer Double Dash over 64.
<AJIsAwesome> Had much more fun with DD.
<sub06905|Gamecube> ^
<AJIsAwesome> 64 may be nostalgic, but I hate its controls.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well i have to get up in a few hours may as well get some sleep, Goodnight everyone, Thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU

<Derpy_Hooves> Lil_B: type in "battle of lil slugger remix" on youtube

<Rain> long ago
<Mega_Milk> Rain: Really? So how was it being a mod?
<Rain> I never was one ^_^
<Mega_Milk> Rain: I imagine like getting kissed by celestia
<Mega_Milk> with a mouth full of scotch
<Rain> my application got thrown out before it ever reached the mods for voting ^_^
<Mega_Milk> Rain: Ehhh.....Why???
<Mega_Milk> Were ya' being a deliquent? :3
<Rain> because things were going down and the lead admin decided it would just be awkward if I became a mod
<Mega_Milk> Ehhhh......Thats kind of a dream killer I suppose.
<Mega_Milk> In my honest opinion.
*Rain shrugs
<Mega_Milk> Brutally honest.
<Mega_Milk> I hate evrything about the idea of moderatirs
<Mega_Milk> Not sure why...
*Rain shrugs
<Mega_Milk> Maybe its cause i just hate authority :3
<Mega_Milk> Meh
<Rain> watching my boy friend has taught me that Im kinda glad I didnt become a mod

<Mega_Milk> Rain: Ha! I can see how that would happen.
<Mega_Milk> Rain: Well if your not willing to take the hits you cant give em' out. As it were said.
<Rain> indeed
<Mega_Milk> Well
<Mega_Milk> for all its worth
<Rain> so instead of moderating
<Mega_Milk> I think you would have been a great mod :3
<Rain> I kinda act like a ninja mod

<Tiberium126> AdamTheDuck, lol. I dont care for PS3 or 360, they do all the same
<SuperSony65> Whoa guys.
<SotoroIwata> Scumbag Microsoft is stupid >.>

<Chrysalis> made by idiots
<Mega_Milk> SuperSony65: nuuu! you are an imposter! >.>
<Panda> So really
<Panda> what did I wake up to?

<SuperSony65> Hey, XBrony360! Hey, XBrony360! You're not as good as me. :I
<Tiberium126> XBrony360, Sounds like you love the xbox now.
*d3rb picks up pc and walks to the quiet area of chat
<Chrysalis> its not like developers have to hack the motion controls in games to make them LOOK like they are working
*Panda sets 1000000000000 Wii's on fire.
<Mega_Milk> Panda: Nothing he just said superbrony64 is gone forever ;^; but we wants him back ;^;

<Rain> what's wrong, Panda?
<Panda> J_E_Smith71 i know :)
<Chrysalis> but the manufacturers wouldnt liscence the cars with it on
<J_E_Smith71> So what ep did he play before?
<CrimsonPhoenix> XBrony360, the xbox360 didn't invent the wheel controller
<d3rb> they didnt?
<Mega_Milk> J_E_Smith71: The episode were they do the foal free express.
<Panda> Rain, we need to bring SB back to the side of Nintendo. He must frollic in the hours of wasted lives and grandeur of the remade games that use remedial programming!
<Mega_Milk> J_E_Smith71: Cant remember the specific episdoe name.
<XBrony360> 09,03...The cars really looked super awesome and the controls felt like I was really there!
<Rain> no, d3rb, they didnt
<d3rb> but.....they told me they did ;_;
<Rain> the wheel controller has been around for a loooong time
<Panda> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> YOU'RE NOT MY FAVORITE SUPERBRONY64
<Panda> since atari XD
<Chrysalis> well at least XBrony360 has stopped with the sarcasm
<d3rb> why would they lie...right to my face ;_;
<Tiberium126> d3rb, LOL where did you find that out?
<Mega_Milk> My first wheel was for ps2 and it was for need for speed.
<Rain> I remember one controller for the PC. it was a wheel
<CrimsonPhoenix> and why am I watching a slideshow
<Rain> and gas peddle
<Mega_Milk> My second was for mario kart wii
<Rain> and brake
<d3rb> Tiberium126, i had a mad catz wheel for ps1 :P
<Mega_Milk> and my last was for 360
<J_E_Smith71> Normally I wouldn't be here at this hour, but I woke up earlier and noticed I forgot to shut the computer off. I come over and see random episode playing
<Rain> and gear shifter
<SuperSony65> If you still have one of our fine PS2's, you should get an EyeToy. :)
<SuperSony65> Great fun for the whole family! :D
<XBrony360> 09,03I am Xbox. I am everything. I will not fall. I will not be second. I am pure.

<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, sure
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHOVRhN5yTA
<pony_6396> Sorry, I was trying to get chat and video to load awhile back. As soon as I refreshed the page, I heard the message chime and saw yellow text for a moment. Who was texting me?
<Zia> Phase4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktDbFe-3l48 this is the official reupload
<Dark_Horst> dat guinen
<Phase4> 00,02pony_6396, Saturn was, tab fail
<Dark_Horst> ....least i think that'S how her an,e is spelled
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Is he speaking Klingon? Because most of the Korean lyrics are the kinds of stuff that have NO translation into the Klingon language.
<flutterchu> um?
<Dark_Horst> its klingon
<Phase4> 00,02Zia, thx
<Dark_Horst> sounds like it, at least
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu|Birthday, its klingon, there are translations on youtube
*AdamTheDuck wished he spent the time to watch Star Trek :<
<Phase4> 00,02my spell-checker doesn't have 'klingon'
<flutterchu> well that was usefull
<CrazyCherry> Kandarihu|Birthday: First you ntranslate it intoEnglish, Then into klingon.
<Tiberium126> AdamTheDuck, I have only watched the NG
<Kandarihu|Birthday> CrazyCherry, but the Klingong language only has words that pertain to war and space travel.
<Phase4> 00,02oppa science style
<Phase4> 00,02Ordinalthrone, aus bronys /)
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Oppa Bill Nye Style
<AdamTheDuck> Dat ass
<Zia> Inertia is a property of style.
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Zia, lol
*AdamTheDuck licks Ordinalthrone
<Dark_Horst> klingon is the most fleshed out sci fi language ever. they crammed a whole bunch of linguists into a room and locked the door
<Tiberium126> Phase4, going to the Bronycon in 2013?
<Dark_Horst> when they were let out again, they had come up with a language that can actually be spoken and understood in daily life
<Dark_Horst> well, if you know klingon
<Tiberium126> Lol my stream stoped on dat ass
<Ordinalthrone> me too
<Tiberium126> stopped*

<Phase4> 00,02got my L's bout a week after i was legally able to
<Phase4> 00,02aced the test thing
<Phase4> 00,02then NEVER drove
<Tiberium126> Lil_B thanks for making me membering that I can just get a pony to sdyney
<Phase4> 00,02got like 5 of 120 hours
<Tiberium126> remembering*
<Kandarihu|Birthday> c
<Kandarihu|Birthday> J/K
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah I usually just end up using public transport to get to where ever
<Lil_B> Tiberium126 no problem ... how did I do this?
<Dark_Horst> oh, the irony
<Tiberium126> Phase4, got my L but dont drive that much
<Tiberium126> Lil_B, saying horses
<Lil_B> XD
<Phase4> 00,02at this rate my L's will expire before i get enough time
<pony_6396> What's causing the flying cars?
<Phase4> 00,02pony_6396, negative wheel friction
<Kandarihu|Birthday> I got a Non-Driver's ID
<pony_6396> Heh. Funny.
<Tiberium126> Phase4, on my test I got 30/30. I think they make it to easy
<Kandarihu|Birthday> This game needs to apply the negative friction to shoes. EVERYONE FLYING AROUND
<Dark_Horst> total mayhem. love it
<Phase4> 00,0229/30, i got the 'by how much is your risk of having an accident reduced after 120 hours of experience' question wrong
<Phase4> 00,02and only that question
<Phase4> 00,02its a bizarre bullshit question
<Chrysalis> yeah
<Chrysalis> especially as it should go up
<Chrysalis> not down
<Chrysalis> as people get complacant
<brodashX> Hi everypony :D
<CrazyCherry> Got my moped card with two points off. ._.
<Tiberium126> https://www.service.transport.qld.gov.au/rrtexternal/SelectExam.jsp
<AdamTheDuck> It goes up because you don't have a supervisor anymore... Damn trick questions. :P
<Tiberium126> Thats all I used
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, the idea is those 120 hours are spent with an instructor, but anyone with a licence is legally able to instruct
<Tiberium126> brodash, G'day
<Phase4> 00,02and there are a lot of morons out there with licences teaching other morons
<Phase4> 00,02thus the chinese wisper of driving knowledge continues
<Tiberium126> Phase4, The teenagers in this world a very sad.

<AdamTheDuck> God my trip to NSW was horrid >.<
<Tiberium126> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Spent an hour to go to the New Years fireworks
<Tiberium126> I was in a car all day and night
<d3rb> i've never been there for more than 2 days so to be fair i actual;ly like what i've seen
<Lil_B> back in 10th grade our english teacher included Australian english in the lessons, but I can only remember british english and american english
<AdamTheDuck> Got there and there wasn't enough space for everyone to see the main fireworks, the only areas with enough room had their view blocked by buildings
<AdamTheDuck> So much FUUUUUUUUUUUU
<d3rb> Lil_B, ill test you
<d3rb> scar non cobber?
<Lil_B> d3rb erm... ok xD
<Dark_Horst> is that even english?
<Tiberium126> Lil_B, Australian English. its dat best English
<Lil_B> australien english, not australian slang >.<
<d3rb> yes lol
<AdamTheDuck> Lolwut Lil_B, Australian english? .-.
<d3rb> i've written it as its pronounced
<d3rb> scar non (what going on)
<d3rb> whats*
<brodashX> i somehow find it funny when you see those asian tourists in like cowboy hats and sunnys
<brodashX> idk why
<Tiberium126> freeze the balls off a brass monkey, Im now a pirate
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck yes, always british english, 9th grade was american english, and 10th was australian english :/
<d3rb> because we all where akubra hats and have pet kangaroos of course
<AdamTheDuck> brodashX, I find it more amusing when I get to convince Americans that we ride kangaroos to school :P
<brodashX> LOL
<Tiberium126> 23million live in Australia. thats F all
<brodashX> cause all the populations like around the coast
<Lil_B> Tiberium126 81 milion in germany, and no compare the size :P
<d3rb> true
<Tiberium126> Australia can fit a lot more
<d3rb> we can and cant
<d3rb> we need a major infrastructure overhaul
<AdamTheDuck> May I asked what you studied exactly in Australian english Lil_B? I mean you could study it in a linguistics sense, but the way you make it sound it's like you're studying another language ._.
<brodashX> eeyup
<MadSurge> So guys, anyone excited about Halloween? :D I want more horror movies
<Tiberium126> d3rb, Just waiting on LABOUR to do that
<brodashX> i speak jibberish
<Tiberium126> ^
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, shall we all vote for Alien for Movie Night? :D
<Midnight_Fyre> that was played too recently
<Tiberium126> good idea adam
<AdamTheDuck> Really? Damn...
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: how about The Thing? :3
<Tiberium126> ...
<AdamTheDuck> Aliens? :3
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, ooh I got to go see that movie :3
<d3rb> dammit...thats a really good idea, i love that movie
<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck actually, just different Words for a lot of things and some things like how greetings in Australia etc. ANd a lot of History and Trivia about it
<MadSurge> Carpenter is a special effects genius
<Midnight_Fyre> the first 3 alien movies were all shown over the summer. I don't think The Thing has been played though
<Tiberium126> FULL MOON TOMORROW
<d3rb> but i want to see trainspotting and tron!
<brodashX> a movie about cowboys and aliens would be funny
<MadSurge> brodashX: already did :D
<Tiberium126> brodashX, class B
<Midnight_Fyre> To be honest the effects were the only thing I liked about The Thing. The movie itself didn't impress me
<AdamTheDuck> Midnight_Fyre, oh God 3 was played?
<brodashX> damn
<MadSurge> d3rb: only interested in Trainspotting
<AdamTheDuck> Aliens 3*
<Midnight_Fyre> yep, 3 was played for the trilogy event
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh trilogy
<Lil_B> oh, Ranjid rettet die Welt hits the theaters soon :3
<d3rb> MadSurge, /)
<AdamTheDuck> I just want to forgot I even watched 3 and 4...
<MadSurge> Bleh, 3 was like the first only shittier and more cruel
<AdamTheDuck> forget*
<Tiberium126> I know how about we watch my Gopro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak?
<Midnight_Fyre> They played the extended version of all of them. 3 did was not good enough to justify an extended version
<MadSurge> d3rb: (\
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: dat alien/human hybrid O__o
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, that was so fucked it...
<Midnight_Fyre> Anyone want to hear about Canterlot Gardens? I was there for the first two days
<Tiberium126> *I know how about we watch my Go Pro clips of me fishing in the ocean on a kayak for 20kg TUNA?
<Tiberium126> Midnight_Fyre, yer sure
<Midnight_Fyre> it was awesome. Tara Strong cosplayed as Twilight
<Tiberium126> and?
<MadSurge> Midnight_Fyre: AWESOME :D
<Midnight_Fyre> And they brought in a bunch of non-pony actors to do a VA rwading of Boast Busters
<MadSurge> :D
<Tiberium126> :_
<Tiberium126> :)
<Lil_B> sounds awesomne : D
<Midnight_Fyre> Including John DiMaggio, who voiced Trixie as Bender
<Lil_B> how long was Canterlot Gardens?
<MadSurge> Midnight_Fyre: HOW APPROPRIATE :D
<Midnight_Fyre> Lil_B: Started Friday and ends today
<Lil_B> ah :)
<Midnight_Fyre> And Lee Tockar is now my favorite voice actor on the show. That guy is awesome
<Tiberium126> Midnight_Fyre, where was it?
<Midnight_Fyre> Strongsville, Ohio
<Lil_B> Lee Tockar, who did he voice?
<Midnight_Fyre> Snips and Steven Magnet
<Tiberium126> DROP THE BASS
<Randomnerd> http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=bbwlinks&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=136590
<d3rb> great, now there is bass all over the floor
<Randomnerd> Happy banned books week, everyone!
<Midnight_Fyre> He's really enthusiastic and knows how to work the crowd
<Randomnerd> Twilight Sparkle won't let Sara Tailin restrict these books to a locked shelf :)
<Tiberium126> Randomnerd, I only read non-ficton
<MadSurge> Midnight_Fyre: he's so enthusiastic about HIS BEAUTIFUL MOUSTACHE
<d3rb> 1984 was a banned book? o_O
<Tiberium126> Fiction
<Randomnerd> The irony is strong in that one.
<MadSurge> ^^^
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe <3 The Catcher in the Rye
<Randomnerd> Tiberium126: Have you read the Pentagon Papers?
<Randomnerd> They're dry, but they were suppressed.
<Midnight_Fyre> And toward the end of the day yesterday I bumped into him and we ended up having a pretty interesting talk about the stone Pinkamena carving I made and brought to show people. I made sure to show him since I had the opportunity because I know he carves stone as well
<Tiberium126> Randomnerd, I read about The 3rd reich or Nazis
<AdamTheDuck> Sometimes I hate youtube, sometimes I absolutely adore it! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbGMeToAspk
<d3rb> youtube comments are worse than /b/
<Midnight_Fyre> true
<Randomnerd> Very few books about Nazis get censored.
<AdamTheDuck> d3rb, uhh just learn not to scroll down. That's what I do mostly... :/
<Saturn> 08,01what class am i?
<Midnight_Fyre> And I had to wait in lines for 3.5 hours for Tara Strong's autograph
<Randomnerd> Consensus seems to be people should have taken "Mein Kampf" more serious when it was published :(
<d3rb> AdamTheDuck, i do but some are hard to avoid
<Saturn> 08,01Midnight_Fyre: you think that's bad, Tara Strong had to sit at a table even longer, signing autographs
<Rain> ^
<AdamTheDuck> ^^
<Rain> Saturn
<Rain> do you know any bronouns?
<Saturn> 08,01what's a bronoun?
<Lil_B> I can only imagin Tara, in the last few autografs, crying and bleeding onto the pictures -.-
<Midnight_Fyre> Saturn: true, true
<Rain> its like a brotato
<Rain> or Brosidon
<Lil_B> or a Bromato
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i'll uh, be in my bunk
<Rain> or Brosif Stallin
<Randomnerd> Napoleon Bronaparte.
<AdamTheDuck> or Bronology
<Lil_B> or Brodolf ... forget it
<Midnight_Fyre> And then last night they had some live brony music. I can't remember who it was, but some guy did some really awesome blues rock
<Lil_B> Saturn erm... ok? I won't/can't stop you from doing that XD
<Rain> heres one I bet you didnt ever think of
<Rain> Bronco
<MadSurge> Hello Saturn! :3 How are you?
<Lil_B> Saturn but I were the CDs I gave you any good?
<Midnight_Fyre> Actually the live music was one of the funnest parts, but it was also one of the most awkward because I think some guy was trying to feel up my chest at one point during the music. 6_9
<Rain> bronology, the study of bro
<Rain> I like that AdamTheDuck
<MadSurge> Ohai Rain!
<d3rb> thats really awkward Midnight_Fyre ....
<AdamTheDuck> :3
<Tiberium126> How I hate American news
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: they wer fantastic! thank you so much! <3
<Cypresswolf> Good moring all - some breakfast music for those just waking up :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avU5onrWfYo

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Cypresswolf, breakfast music you say? :3

<Cypresswolf> :3 yesh
<Tiberium126> American Media :|
<AdamTheDuck> 'Merica
<MadSurge> Tiberium126: confound them!
<AdamTheDuck> Suddenly ded chat :<
<Midnight_Fyre> d3rb: Yeah, basically, as the night went on about half the people on the dance floor had taken off their shirts, including me, and during a slow song some guy puts his arm around my shoulder as if to start a sideways swaying line (no problem there because it wouldn't have been the first time it had happened that night), but his hand landed a bit far and low and basically cupped itself right around my nipple. awkwa
<Tiberium126> :D
<AdamTheDuck> Dayum dat wall o' text
<d3rb> mega awkward
<Midnight_Fyre> sorry, didn't realize i had written so much
<d3rb> lol i've done that before
<Lil_B> I write too much all the time :3
<Midnight_Fyre> I'm hoping I was just imagining it
<d3rb> it always seems shorter when you think of what to type
<AdamTheDuck> Midnight_Fyre, http://derpy.me/gZnBj
<Tiberium126> Bronies/Furries UNITE!
<d3rb> unite for....?
<Midnight_Fyre> AdamTheDuck: :D

<AdamTheDuck> brb~
<Midnight_Fyre> Also, Pixelkitties was a really awesome artist to talk to, and she wore the "JERK" shirt from Dan Vs.
<Lil_B> ... I entered and invalid Password after my restart, but I can still use the name... Safty Measuers everyone :)
<Cypresswolf> Batman meets Ponies http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3kAFfgsa4s - couldnt stay up long enough for the stream to end to post this last night
<d3rb> i thought about a password, then i thought, why the hell would anyone use my name?
<AdamTheDuck> While I'm gone, have a relaxing song everyone :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvGL63o827g
<d3rb> i wonder if that ever happens, people using other peoples names
<Midnight_Fyre> If I listen to relaxing music right now I'll fall back asleep. so tired
<JRP|laptop> Phase4:
<d3rb> you a link to something to pump you up?
<Midnight_Fyre> actually I'm really tempted to go back to bed
<Tiberium126> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ysDV9POBXE
<Tiberium126> That song hits the spot
<JRP|laptop> hi giez
<Midnight_Fyre> That reminds me of another thing. One of the musicians played a half hour tribute song to Cupcakes :O
<d3rb> hello JRP2234
<Maid_RainBow> i have to go everypony
<Tiberium126> Cupcakes did you say CUPCAKES
<Maid_RainBow> bye bye
<Tiberium126> bye maid_rainbow
<Midnight_Fyre> bye Maid_RainBow
<brodashX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X4ZflBPXU
<Midnight_Fyre> Tiberium126: I did indeed. It sort of progresses as a look into Pinkie's mind from the moment she starts becoming paranoid in Party of One to the point where she completely snaps and starts making "cupcakes"
<Tiberium126> Midnight_Fyre, Cupcakes
<Midnight_Fyre> yep
<Cypresswolf> Anyone listen to the Vinyl Scratch Tapes? Here's their panel of Brony Fan Fair :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GweGzevnm4E

<AdamTheDuck> Yay back in time for Phase4's wakeup call
<Saturn> 08,01oppam Klingon style!
<Midnight_Fyre> I wish I could remember who the guy was. I just remember that I couldn't stop thinking that he looked like Oancitizen from TGWTG
<MadSurge> A PARTYYYYYY :$
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya Phase4 you shoulg get the helecopter mod/ update for kerbal space program :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> *should
<Phase4> mods are a little anoying to install
<Colt_Brovakiin> Oh fair enough

<Tiberium126> Life is 20% cooler with ponies
<Midnight_Fyre> indeed
<JRP|laptop> whos streaming
<Tiberium126> Phase
<AdamTheDuck> JRP2234, Phase is, can't you tell by the music? :3
<Phase4> and the volume
<JRP|laptop> Phase4: why you no play "we dont need no education"?
<Phase4> JRP2234, its not as loud
<Phase4> also less clients pls
<d3rb> Dr. Macabre - Poltergeist play that :P
<JRP|laptop> hmm just a sec
<Phase4> but the server i'm about to go on already has music :(
<Phase4> tf2 is taking time to load
<JRP|laptop> Phase4: forgot to quit the other one
<MadSurge> So Phase4, do you work as a coder for a living? Or is it just a hobby?
<Phase4> hobby
<Tiberium126> coding bores me
<Phase4> i'm a student currently
<Phase4> Tiberium126, :(
<d3rb> probably should be a coder then Tiberium126 :P
<Phase4> i'm doing electronics and electrical engineering
<Phase4> you dont do that and not do at least a little computer science
<MadSurge> Tiberium126: I can't make heads or tales of it, but I'm happy that Phase4 likes it :)
<Phase4> two fields are practically indistinguisable
<MadSurge> *tails
<Phase4> though you only see part of one side from the other
<Saturn> 08,01need to peeeeeee
<Tiberium126> Phase4, its a hobby for you, like doing nothing is a hobby for me
*Saturn 08,01runs to the toilet
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, lolwut
<AdamTheDuck> Suddenly TF2 noises ._.
<MadSurge> Suddendly loaded :D
<Lil_B> >.< have to make an Grubbs' test for outliers in Excel :/
<Saturn> 08,01sorry, i don't know why i felt the need to share that
<Lil_B> it was the 3rd time this week you did that : |
<Tiberium126> Saturn, you put a image in my head of you taking a piss
<Phase4> drag and drop
<Phase4> aparently a complex feature
<AdamTheDuck> Doesn't sound complex Phase4. :3
<Phase4> http://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/sect-Protocol-Drag-and-Drop.html
<MadSurge> Saturn: do you send it to Bear Grylls afterwards? :D
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, theres a lot of text
<MadSurge> "Dude, calm down" :D
<Phase4> waiting for wayland to be complete enough to replace x
<AdamTheDuck> But drag and drop doesn't sound too menacing :P
<Phase4> i've got an intel gpu now so no nvidia problems holding me back
<AdamTheDuck> "Sound"
<MadSurge> DRAW :[
<Tiberium126> Phase4, you think coding is complex. try doing nothing
<Zia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7R0rY_XAxE
<Colt_Brovakiin> Zia: There is a stream, no non-image links please
<MadSurge> Zia, no yt links during streams :|
<Zia> >expecting me to know when the stream is on
<Zia> also that's a stupid rule in the first place
<Tiberium126> Zia, lol
<Colt_Brovakiin> Why is it stupid, it is rude for the streamer
<Zia> not really
<Zia> they don't have to click
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hmm true
<Lil_B> btw, generall querstion, because it confuses me again and again every time, is the rule "No Video Links" (what would mean I can post for example an article about something) or "only image links" wwhat would mean, wqell, exactly that
<Lil_B> well*
<AdamTheDuck> I thought the rule was no non-image links
<Randomnerd> Gotta go, Brony Meet-up in NYC today :)
<Tiberium126> READ THE RULES PEOPLE
<Colt_Brovakiin> Have fun Randomnerd
<Randomnerd> Bye all, we'll take pictures!
<AdamTheDuck> So only image links are allowed, although I assume some text links may be an exception
<Randomnerd> Thanks, Colt_Brovakiin
<MadSurge> Lil_B: you can post articles and stuff... just no videos
<Lil_B> Randomnerd be sure to cause a commotion :)
<Lil_B> MadSurge good :)
<Tiberium126> Do not post non-image links during streamsVideo links and links to external sites are not allowed during streams unless you are given permission by a moderator. Do not advertise other sites or channels. If you want to share a link during a stream, PM it to your recipient.
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Rand - too late >.<

<d3rb> later col...gone
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Colt_ah well
<Lil_B> that awkward moment when your dad really wants to make a joke, but can laugh because you saw the Poante from a mile away :/
<Lil_B> can't laugh*
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tiberium those looks like anthro snakes
<Rex_Mundi> Ha, japanese! http://i390.photobucket.com/albums/oo345/stryke81/MLP/53120__safe_twilight-sparkle_trixie_artist-needed.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> especially Rainbow Dash
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, ya
<d3rb> i couldnt see it before but now its all i see
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, Japanese gets it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Is it wrong that I know that doujin actually exist in that picture?
<Rex_Mundi> I know some guy in japan is making an MLP JRPG fangame. There are videos of it on niconico.
<Lil_B> isn't there already a FF6 MLP Version?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh and guys, have some humanized ponies http://fav.me/d4r821l
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, he meanan actual MLP JRPG from scratch
<Tiberium126> The thing about furry its a bit sexual.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a fetish of course it is
<Tiberium126> fetish :|
<Tiberium126> No in my opinion its not
<AdamTheDuck> Everytime I hear fetish all I can imagine is Saturn
<CrimsonPhoenix> though there are some people that just enjoy furred character because they're cute
<Bronysith> i like anything sexy
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, I like it because its ART
<CrimsonPhoenix> That's fine for you
<CrimsonPhoenix> I do enjoy art as well
<Rex_Mundi> Tiberium126: CrimsonPhoenix: Furry can be a fetish, but there are a lot of furrys who hate furry porn. There are actually quite a few "asexuals' in the fandom.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, and there are alot that lives with it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but let's put that subject into a close
<Bronysith> sexy art is best art
<CrimsonPhoenix> sensitive subject
<CrimsonPhoenix> so if you wish to discuss that with me PM me
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: TRUE, some of the time
<Bronysith> GRAVY
<DeadpoolDash> pootis
<Tiberium126> I have no problem with Sexual art but there is a lot in furry
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 Phase4 begins to go "Wtf is happening in chat?" :D
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349008410482.jpg
<Phase4> wtf is happening in chat
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tiberium126, I said we're closing the subject
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, now that you mention it
<Dken2021> morning y'all
<DeadpoolDash> wtf in chat is so common it isnt really wtf anymore
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, why?
<CrimsonPhoenix> You'll see
<Lil_B> Tiberium126 yeah, I think a lot of the artist who draw the NSFW Art actually mostly draw it for the heck of it
<Rex_Mundi> I found the JRPG video, but its streaming right now...
<Tiberium126> Lil_B, mhmm
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349004799681.png
<Bronysith> OH GOD
<Tiberium126> http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=MLP+furry&offset=144#/d4p47ly
<Dken2021> Bronysith I love that one XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, I think Mixermike did that
<DeadpoolDash> lots of NSFW artists do it for commissions
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah I can recognise that style
<Rex_Mundi> http://th00.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2011/273/3/7/my_little_gargoyle_by_bri_chan-d4bcmia.jpg
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/596ce115fd5f5105146b21e02d7cba42.jpg THEY DUN GOOFED NOW :D
<Lil_B> I searched for a really realistic MLP Picture i saw month ago, but caN#T FIND IT ANYMORE >:<
<Dken2021> oh yea, thanks Lil_B for showing me the HD Mother 3 music

<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348981022551.png oh ho ho i can see where this is going
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, are you talking about Stalkerloo?
<Tiberium126> Bronysith, eeyup
<Dken2021> anyways, just dropping by, laters
<Lil_B> Dken2021 no prop, are you enjoing it?
<MadSurge> Bronysith: Big Mac goes NOPE and runs away?
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I forgot the name of the artist
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I only know that it looked really handdrawn, stily like realistic grown up horses, and pinkie Pie laughing
<Wirisme> How's it going everyone
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, like this? http://fav.me/d5br46m
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Wirisme

<Lil_B> AdamTheDuck no, they looked like real horses... real horses with a lot of color
<AdamTheDuck> Ah

<MadSurge> Lil_B: so it's not this either http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/d0dd4cb4b3b9ba3a8a18ac58d6844a4c.jpg
<Lil_B> MadSurge no, thats real human like, I mean really feral like
<MadSurge> Like true ponies :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> This is what I got for realistic MLP http://i.imgur.com/yuLiS.jpg
<Rex_Mundi> Lil_B: Unicorns were traditionally supposed to be a mix of creatures, with a horn, a horses body, and goat-like feat.
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348989359539.jpg dafuq
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm....scared
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh dammit MadSurge
<Rex_Mundi> I want to see Rainbow dashs relatives.

<Chrysalis> just got back from shopping
<Rex_Mundi> Anypony here collect the toys? My opinion is that the brushables are greatly better than the blind bags.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: 4chan leech :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pinkie stop munching the 4th wall
<Tiberium126> http://foxylover1324.deviantart.com/art/true-furry-love-314599901
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, finally
<Chrysalis> might carry on playthrough 2 of borderlands 2
<CrimsonPhoenix> I bought brushables way before
<CrimsonPhoenix> >unless you a immature little shit what's not to love?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Stay classy furries
<Bronysith> i think i need to get back to borderlands 2 considering no one wants to do anything
<Tiberium126> MUHAHAHAHA
<DeadpoolDash> molded ponies are better for me since I cant style the hair to be show accurate
<Tiberium126> Bronysith, got COH?
<Bronysith> what?
<Tiberium126> I take that as a no
<Bronysith> whats COH?
<AdamTheDuck> Forever-a-tiberium
<Tiberium126> Company of heros
<Rex_Mundi> I really just started collecting, I have half the mane 6. I wonder who i should get next? Rarity, Twilight and applejack.

<Tiberium126> AdamTheDuck, alright
<CrimsonPhoenix> there
<DeadpoolDash> way too much work for me
<CrimsonPhoenix> DeadpoolDash, you sissy
<Rex_Mundi> CrimsonPhoenix: Yes, I guess i just like the brushable hair, I dont see much of a point to the blind bags other than decoration.
<DeadpoolDash> I comb my hair by shaving it off
<CrimsonPhoenix> You monster
<CrimsonPhoenix> why would you ruin your beautifull hair
<DeadpoolDash> plus i have to stay in regs
<Tiberium126> AdamTheDuck, your dead to me
<AdamTheDuck> ._.
*AdamTheDuck licks Tiberium126
*Tiberium126 hus himself because hes Forever Alone
<Tiberium126> hugs
<Tiberium126> lol
*AdamTheDuck hugs Tiberium126...
<AdamTheDuck> Damn this buffer :<
<Rex_Mundi> Going back to furries, was anyone ells here at FA when the Devial is magic" banner was on the site? lol, so many furry eliteists who trash the brony part of their fandom for "dragging the fandom through the mud with their childish crap" got super pissed.:D
<Rex_Mundi> *Denial is magic"
<DeadpoolDash> the furry community is a fickle beast
<Tiberium126> yes, furries. we are as various as can be. it is those that go too far with it that give us a bad rap. we are just people like everyone else, with a common interest.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hey guys you know what we can do?
<Tiberium126> Okay im done
<Wirisme> something?
<PillowPoni|Phone> MadSurge, love letters updated <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Let's drop the furry subject and talk about something more safe.
<AdamTheDuck> CrimsonPhoenix, take over the internet? :3
<Wirisme> Let's talk about seatbelts!
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, it is safe if you make it.
<Rex_Mundi> The furry fandom is much more like a collection of fandoms rather than a single one. no wonder they can never get along. Try putting an FurAffinity users with sofurry forum users.
<DeadpoolDash> ...is it safe?
<Tiberium126> DeadpoolDash, to talk about...... yes
<DeadpoolDash> ...is if safe?
<Wirisme> Ok we're still talking about it
<Rex_Mundi> Keep it secret, keep it safe.
<Tiberium126> I LOVE SEATBELTS
<CrimsonPhoenix> now let us admire this gorgeous painting http://fav.me/d525g4r

<DeadpoolDash> ...but, is it safe?
<Wirisme> me too Lil_B
<AdamTheDuck> No one is safe on the internet DeadpoolDash. No one. :<
<DeadpoolDash> ...but, is it safe?
<Tiberium126> DeadpoolDash, no and the same with MLP
<DeadpoolDash> ...but, is it safe?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d4u1vsb
<Lil_B> but, will it blend?
<DeadpoolDash> ...but, is it safe?
<Tiberium126> DeadpoolDash, its not safe. HAPPY?>
<Wirisme> are you safe?
<DeadpoolDash> ...but, is it safe?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5c1boi
<Wirisme> am I safe?
<Tiberium126> F it

<MadSurge> DeadpoolDash: you're not a dentist, quit it!
<Cypresswolf> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/2905088_700b.jpg
<DeadpoolDash> is it safe?

<Rex_Mundi> Well, for one i know there is nothing safer than discussing Slugbox on these forums!:P>_><_<
<Cypresswolf> Darnit Boromir :| You crashed my page
*Tiberium126 hugs DeadpoolDash
<Cypresswolf> http://lolblog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/sovietlotr.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> Slugbox is shitty
<Wirisme> slugbox?
<DeadpoolDash> ...but, is it safe?
<Mega_Milk> CrimsonPhoenix: the artist?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> His style is horrendous
<MadSurge> Cypresswolf: so much clopart :(
<Mega_Milk> CrimsonPhoenix: Your joking right?
<Mega_Milk> MadSurge: He does it to pay his bills
<CrimsonPhoenix> No I ain't
<MadSurge> Ohai Mega_Milk!
<Rex_Mundi> IT WAS A JOKE! dont start discussing Slugbox!
<MadSurge> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just state an opinion
<Mega_Milk> Ehhh....well while i strongly disagree with you crimsonpheonix to each his own.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but yeah I'll be done now
*AdamTheDuck quickly googles Slugbox
<Tiberium126> LOL you guys cant stand sexual art can you?
<AdamTheDuck> I am just going to remain silent now.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, you've doomed yourself
<Mega_Milk> Tiberium126: I am an r34 atrist.
<DeadpoolDash> ...but, is it safe?
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back and...........THIS DAY ARIA!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Now THIS is what I love http://fav.me/d5c1boi
<Dark92Enigma> YES YES YES
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Dark92Enigma

<Tiberium126> See people mega_milk thinks its art
<AdamTheDuck> Dark92Enigma, not quiet exactly...
<AdamTheDuck> I feel alien in tonight's chat :S
<Dark92Enigma> Milk.......it keeps you safe from all Satanic Troll attacks
<Rex_Mundi> So... anypony ells have any pony toys? My opinion is firmly Brushables are greatly better than blindbags.
<Wirisme> You're not alone AdamTheDuck
<Dark92Enigma> AdamTheDuck: me too
<Wirisme> I have none
<Wirisme> and probably never will
*AdamTheDuck patiently awaits for an Octavia toy.
<Rex_Mundi> Everypony should get pony toys, the brushable hair is entertaining and they are very cute!

<MadSurge> Lil_B: I tend to drift off and do other things :D
*Tiberium126 is watching Adam. like pinkie would watch someone.
<Cypresswolf> Rex_Mundi: I only collect the G4 merch and the customs - figure its far too late to start collecting the original G1 stuff

<Rex_Mundi> Cypresswolf: You must have multyples, right? like more than 1 twilight, right?
*alexxm kidnaps Lil_B
<Lil_B> noooo *muffled complaining*
*AdamTheDuck kidnaps alexxm as he kidnaps Lil_B
<Rex_Mundi> Puts a saddle on AdamTheDuck. And a stirip and muzzle...

<Cypresswolf> I just stack all the pony merch on a pile in the corner

<Cypresswolf> More than enough
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 everyone requests a dupe from Cypresswolf XD
<Wirisme> ;)

<Bronysith> CriticKitten: dat delayed response
<Kimori> hey Blako
<CriticKitten> I was in the middle of a hostile enemy lab.
<CriticKitten> Kinda hard to dagger spam AND talk in IRC. :P
<thelonepony> i love this pic, too damn cute http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Ready-for-the-Prom-329766494
<Lonko> Where the hell is Season 3?
<CriticKitten> Although, I'm getting good enough that at some point that may be possible >_>
<Dken2021> Lonko announcement in 19 days
<thelonepony> Lonko you have to wait
<CriticKitten> Double daggers is so easy to cruise control with. Jump into fray, blast their faces with 6 stacks of bleed, watch them collapse
<Dken2021> like the rest of the good little fillies and gentlecolts
<CriticKitten> Loot bodies.
<CriticKitten> :D
<thelonepony> it will be worth the weight
<Lonko> At least all of the other series are starting again. Treme and Person of Interest. But most of all I want Ponies
<Lil_B> You know what IU would like to see, A Season 4 Kickstarter, just to see how high it can get XD
<Wrek> 05Lonko: i ate it

<Lonko> But it really feels like Season 3 is becoming another Half-Life 3
<Dken2021> I think he got surgery done in between seasons
<Lonko> Except we are waiting almost 5 years for Hl3
<Cypresswolf> Dollar / Cashier / Money Shot http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110319145320/mlp/images/2/26/Dollar.JPG
<CriticKitten> Besides, Bronysith, when GW2 said "dynamic events can occur anywhere", they meant to say "there is no place on the map where you are safe to idle"
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/H4tyvJJzSDk
<Wrek> 05Lonko: stop exagerating :|
<CriticKitten> Nosrsly. I laugh at the people who idle ingame and end up breaking all their armor because they died so many times.
<Lonko> Wrek: I am not. Half Life 3 is long overdue
<CrimsonPhoenix> Actually I think it really has been 5 years since we're waiting for a sequel to Halflife 2 episode 2
<Dken2021> Lonko correction: Half Life 2: Episode 3
<JRP|laptop> Phase4: you still here?
<Wrek> 05Lonko: yes you are, you are comparing season 3 with HL2E3
<Wrek> 05big exaggeration right there
<Lonko> But it feels like it

<Sumica> 00,10should be a dropdown menu for it
<DashWithRainbows> Everlasting_Joy to dominate the map by holding buildings that can give you tech and resources to get vehicles and upgrades
<Chrysalis> i enjoyed bf3, but it was too small
<Serenity> Wrek: Anything's better than BF3
<Chrysalis> time to install :D
<Serenity> Except CoD
<Sumica> 00,10Everlasting_Joy, the final maps will be 200km square
<DashWithRainbows> Oh, and the maps are freaking huge
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0vp1qFtuW1qzvkfwo1_500.png
<prince-dari> Too small?
<prince-dari> The maps on BF3 are big enough for the number of people involved
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: typos like that make for the best images :D
<Bronysith> Sumica: i see it for windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, and 2000
<Wrek> 056000 people per server is their current goal
<Chrysalis> prince-dari yes but they were poorly designed
<Sumica> 00,10odd
<CrimsonPhoenix> yur mah bro, bro
<Chrysalis> and always ended up just spawn camped
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: "Better then BF3" That's not saying much from my experience, but I might just have to look into PS2 then.
<CriticKitten> ....evil Einstein?
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek isn't it 2000 players as of now?
<Sylandest> magnet gun?
<Wrek> 05DashWithRainbows: 2k as of beta

<CriticKitten> Good question, Spiderman. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
<Obsidian> wat
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, I want to read Background Pony and I kinda need an ambient song to keep me in the story
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: If it's f2p, I'll sign on.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I love Mother 3 too much to let it rool in the background
<Everlasting_Joy> Those teeth.
<Obsidian> So appearently webbing is a good replacement for railing
<Serenity> When dry, Spider webs are stronger than Steel
<Dken2021> oh, I'll see if there's soemthing else then
<Serenity> Of course, it can't survive much pressure
<Sumica> 00,10at this rate wrek you better start working on dropship flying
<CriticKitten> Dr Mag-neto~
<Wrek> 05Sumica: well i kinda did have that oen nailed didnt I?

<Rex_Mundi> And then Blind gaurdian pop out

<Bronysith> DAMNIT GRIVEL
<mitamaking> I think Little Kuriboh has been kind of off lately
<DeadpoolDash> nothing will ever beat team four star with their abridged DBZ
<Bronysith> nah
<Panda> Bronysith, thats because you like repeated, recycled jokes for 50+ episodes....
<Bronysith> Panda: they arent repeated dear newbie
<alexxm> d'aww
