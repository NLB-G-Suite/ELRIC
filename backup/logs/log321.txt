*PartyCannon plays the piano
<boreman2579> SPLAT
<Mr> still needs more acid
<Iweywrt> Look at dat CGI
<Meanwhile> Would've been shorter if she just hit the walls on the way down.
<Moshakra> teleport isn't very effective
*Ictiv slpas Colt_of_Personality and Dirt around a bit with a large trout (three stooges style)
<Historical> kk
<TOY_PON3> how long is this fall?
<boreman2579> Indeed
<Woonanon> How does she get out of this alive
<RaveBrony> Slow fall Alice!! Slow Fall!!!
<DrWhoovesIsYourMaste> Where is the levitating nest of dethorned roses?

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> ouch
<PartyCannon> ka-thud
<hank> twilight can only teleport like what.... 2 inches?

<Dapperjack> it's sort of like hitting leaves when you fall in a forest
<Alicepon3> She fell through the CEILING
<Sharakan> whoa
<Discord> she had armor couchin
<Oddsky> Also, I saw this in 3D when it came out... it didn't work that well
<SeriousSeal> ^That
<Dapperjack> cushions the fall
<Yahooz> Pinkie must be here....

<otakon> eeyup
<Dapperjack> hmm, dissapointing all around then
<RainbowKitten> I am Uad. Very.
<Colt_of_Personality> I'm in the minority I think when I say that Wonderland was not inspired by drugs

<Yahooz>
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> locked
<Bloxx> the earth is flat

<emangamer> RainbowcrashNBurn: ninja'd
<Yahooz>
<Moshakra> I think you need an Iadblock
<TOY_PON3> alice defies gravity
<RAWRity> This entire film was practically crafted to try and pander to the dissacociated teenage crowd that had become Burton's most avid fanbase.
<pony_2968> I see a negative zero on top
<Kurra> Yay, now I can watch, what'd I miss? :D
<Iweywrt> This might as well be discords land
<Shizuka> 13silly alice just call up the console und door.unlock

<Dashie_Dashie> Wonderland? Physics? Pfft the world is round there is no up or down.
<Jigglysaint> somebody make Pinkie Pie Alice
<CriticKitten> Oh hey, this must be Tim Burton's attempt at destroying a children's classic, yes?
<BadassDashie> SCREW GRAVITY IM PINKIE PIE
<otakon> also eeyup
<Asmalya> Pinkie actually escaped from wonderland to ponyville
<Space> kick the door down!
<Arcane_Flame> Yeah it was inspired by weird math
<Yahooz> post all the space
<K_A> Shoulda brought some lockpicks, Alice.
<IngloriousPony89> Get me to that rabbit hole then hank!
<RainbowKitten> Kurra: Everything. Even the plot.,
<ekips> she should have skilled lockpicking
<MadxHatter123> Discord, do you have anything to do with this?
<Asmalya> iam sure about that
<DrWhoovesIsYourMaste> Screw gravity, i see huge-ass bunnies with clocks.
<Meanwhile> Because making stuff for your fans doesn't make sense.
<RaveBrony> Lol! Iweywrt, sooo true
<Scoot-Scootaloo> So, does this mean she's in China now?
<Annicity> It wasn't inspired by drugs.
<emangamer> Shizuka: quit making references few people understand
<Sharakan> alice has coolness that defies gravity
<Yahooz> because kirzstryfe

<Kurra> NOOOOOOooooooo.....
<Discord> I might.
<Moshakra> rainbowkitten
<[SWAG]GabeMoist> Wrek will unlock your doors
<Everlasting_Joy> Need ot find the dongeon key.
<StinkomanFan> Everypony knows that Fairy Tales were MUCH creepier when they were originally written
<RainbowcrashNBurn> she must have had the 1/2 fall damage perk from heavy armour tree
<RainbowKitten> Hm?
<RAWRity> it also commits the insufferable crime of being boring as a sack of dirt.
<Shizuka> 13but i like making obscure references :<
<otakon> oh hell yeah
<Quin> This is the kind of room gamers get stuck in for hours
<pikorar> THE PLOT! IT THICKENS!
<prince-dari> Just use a lockpick Alice.
<Moshakra> lol i just wanted your screen to beep
*Kurra Spikeyells
<otakon> eeyup
<Dken2021> unfortunatle disney ruined that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14needs more noclip, amirite?
<Frequency> I love how she is not panicing
<klopki> lol
<hank> drop kick the door open!
<DrWhoovesIsYourMaste> lockpicking=0
<Scoot-Scootaloo> She must have Dead Silence Pro on
<SeriousSeal> She gets progressively more attractive as the movie goes on... :/
<otakon> boring movie for A
<hank> dumb bitch
<fluttercry> 05,15Snow White was REALLY messed up
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> lol
<rivets> wasn't very obscure
<StinkomanFan> Hansel and Gretel baked a woman alive
<TOY_PON3> emangamer: That's the point of references
<Frequency> In any way
<Blackaura_Andrew> I guess her lockpick skills aren't high enough...
<RainbowKitten> Moshakra, it didn't you spelled it wrong.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> small
<CriticKitten> She broke all her lockpicks.
<Shizuka> 13like sheep that tip over und an asparagus has to get them back up

<TopHat> I look up a walkthrough after 10 minutes
<treeman1234> Hey I can get $10000!! no way
<Yahooz> XP
<Colt_of_Personality> It's like Pandora's box from God of War
<Moshakra> That was a pretty uneventful way to chenge realities there
<Anthony> lockpicking skill has increased by 5
<Dirt> what if she died in the hole
<Jigglysaint> boss key
<Woonanon> Small door? No problem
<TimmyTwoLimbs> You're right. She gets beaten up a bunch
<Dirt> and this was all a dream
<Alicepon3> She could fit, if she weren't a fat PIG
<Dermathil> eh.
<MadxHatter123> Seriously, am I the only one with lag?
<Ziltoid> alice is master of unlocking
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p
<Meanwhile> Maybe you should carry a pocket watch Yahooz
<PinkiePie> im pretty sure she needed to push the doors open not pull lol
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> anyone notice she didn't try to push?
<emangamer> Shizuka: I do too but....they aren't "proper"
<Dapperjack> 3D is just another tool that is great when used well but awful when used poorly
<TOY_PON3> Shizuka makes awesome references
<Annicity> How funny it'll seem when she comes out among people that walk with their heads downwards.
<EspyLacopa> Drink it.
<TopHat> :O
<Dken2021> it's kay, nothing happened yet

<Yahooz> What company?
<EspyLacopa> Oops, she forgot the key.
<Blackaura_Andrew> :o

<StinkomanFan> The stories fine, It just flows really slowly
<Djambi> so...what's going on? I can't be assed to pay attention to the plot.
<Dken2021> I know, it's more of the journey mostly
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> upskirty
<EspyLacopa> I -MAKE- the path!
<IngloriousPony89> So she fell down a rabbit hole and now she thinks she's dreaming?
<RainbowcrashNBurn> accused of being...and NOT being alice at same time?

<JumpingJoysticks> MUSH!!!!
<Jigglysaint> it's like this movie is self aware that it's trying to rewrite the story
<Discord> take me to whiterun.
<Quin> Cicero wasn't a traitor
<Woonanon> I am the path!
<Yahooz> ohey der Pinkie room

<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> wow
<RAWRity> Dermathil: I'm not complaining it isn't original. I'm saying that, from a story perspective, this has no real purpose. It doesn't advance alice any, nor does it accomplish much outside of showing us that, yes, all these characters are psychotic.

<Princess_Luna> Hello new LC member!
<Oddsky> kinda weak
*Sheepy_TheIPMan screems
<ExAxis> Literally no one's in here D:
<RAWRity> so yea, 4/10 at best. It's clear nobody on production actually cared about this, all they wanted was a movie all the super edgy teen girls would shill out to see. Actors phone it in, Elfman makes the same score he's been using for years, and the plot is padded to hell.
<shadowfalcon76> lol sounds like some messed up 16-bit era boss battle music
<OJPhoenix> hey Luna I just got LoZ MM for my Wii, can you maybe try and stop it from crashing into Termia?
<Alicepon3> I can't even hear the voices :P
