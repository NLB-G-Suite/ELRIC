<oni_link> XD
<ChuYizus> this is technically a flash-forward
<Rookeealding> wait... a flashback.. in a movie that repeats
<Sinestro> good thing we havent seen this scene like 10 times already
<Reallylikehermane> suddenly todd will be a nice guy totally out of character.
<otakon17> So
<Bipolarized> Todd X Kevin OTP
<oni_link> ^^^
<otakon17> Did Tom win?
<Jazmyn> :D
<pony_300> He says he survived a lot worse... then they immediately cut to flashbacks of his past with his family. WAT
<Ta_Dikin> Douche Bag
<Zeus> of course he dd
<Deadlypon3> "Till you feel better about my voice sounding so mellow...."
<Fregy> Toms a good guy after all!

<Dashes> twilight_sprinkle: noooooooooooo!!!

<J_E_Smith71> OohShiny: Yeah that's what the character going through the loop always feels like too in this type of story
<Rookeealding> He has to mean what he learns
<Dashes> he's met with a terrible fate, hasn't he?
<AJfan77> Hey guys /]

<Deadlypon3> Get it...cause she's a grandma who knows what PASTIES are
<Kandarihu> Yeah, I think the canonically weasily excuse for the Easy Bake Oven was probably the most proper excuse.
<pony_300> well that expolains my eerie attraction to the grandma
<DerpyMuffins> The awesome granny clause
<Zeus> SlyTag: no kidding
<DerpyMuffins> Every movie has one
<OohShiny> Forever Alone guy now

<otakon17> Finally
<Dashes> THIRD IMPACT MUST OCCUR TO END THE LOOP
<OohShiny> How to solve the problem: GET OVER IT!
<Sinestro> he has to lay down and let this guy steal his gurl
<Deadlypon3> Unless it's hilarious!
<AJfan77> :| end already
<otakon17> Lol
<Darf14> If you could live one day forever, which day will it be? P.S theres no escape >=)
<pony_6381> None
<Deadlypon3> Darf14 I wouldn't
<Jageman> So, Todd used witchcraft to make sure that the old boyfriend would not see the next day till he accepted losing his ex?
<shadowboy8456> Nope
<MissVenom> Hey Everypony

<Tovler> I'm with red letter media: live action humans acting like cartoon characters is annoying.
<twilight_sprinkle> lel
<DerpyMuffins> Wow
<Fregy> :(
<SlyTag> DICK JOKE
<Sinestro> Todd "i'm a doctor, a WITCH DOCTOR!"
<Somberguy20> Darf14 the day after I find a portal that leads to equestria
<OohShiny> Darf14: and I would be already friend of every pony in the show
<AJfan77> howw do u live a day forever
<Deadlypon3> "Hey, glad that you got married"
<Meth> What should I name Pikachu?
<Deadlypon3> "Hey, your penis is small, no thanks to your horrible marriage of me!"
<Zeus> i stopped caring about these characters in the first ten minutes
<Punkie_Pue> whooa!
<CriticKitten> Well this is sort of a bitter ending. Not bittersweet, just bitter.
<otakon17> Ouch
<Rookeealding> bull lady
<oni_link> yup
<Reallylikehermane> really lady? childbirth over and over?
<SlyTag> GAYWADS
<twilight_sprinkle> damn, that would be a painful loop
<OohShiny> ouch
<Dashes> this ending sucks
<otakon17> Really?
<Cirno> really?that sounds painful to me
<Spazturtle> Darf14: Stop reading the script
<oni_link> full of dissapoint
<Stormy`> Fuzzy
<J_E_Smith71> oni_link: Except the Twinkies and Cupcakes are really tiny: http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/hostess/3.jpg
<Meth> Stormy, Neo, Adjeca, Afflict, Amu, Kind1, or SR?
<Conyst> painful day to pick
<Darf14> Hey! Thats I just said movie! :|
<pony_300> the day your son was born... BULLSHIT
<Sinestro> this is cheesy bullshit
<otakon17> Cirno: Agreed
<Rosfox> Really.... childbirth over and over again?
<Zeus> yup
<CriticKitten> She means the day AFTER, clearly. >.>
<ChuYizus> she must be a masoquist
<oni_link> J_E_Smith71: I need to feed my hostess fix
<Meth> Stormy, you are pikachu'
<otakon17> Sinestro: It IS a Christmas movie
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkle at least in the groundhog loop, it wasn't the WORST DAY Ever for him...it was just a regular day for him
<Dashes> Rosfox: must be a masochist :P
<Gaige> what are we watchimg?
<Stormy`> lol
<shadowboy8456> what is this loop?
<Kraft58> irony
<Stormy`> okay
*MadScientIsht licks Bjornfot and otakon17
<AJfan77> isnt child birth very idk PAINFUL
<Rookeealding> I think that beats out christmas everyday over and over again
<SlyTag> XD
<Deadlypon3> ...
<Deadlypon3> Fuck you bitch
<Bipolarized> Hur hur
<ChuYizus> ouch
<Sinestro> SEE
<Zeus> uhhhh
<shadowboy8456> why are we talking about it?

<Sinestro> HES IN HELL
<Darf14> Spazturtle: Gah! I didnt read the script! It was a coincidence! Honest, it was my fist time watching this movie
<otakon17> Deadlypon3: Yh but he could change it for the better
<OohShiny> IRONY"
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: misping?
<TrixieMuffin> So in the beginning we see that the whole family is just full of shit , and suddenly whole touchyfeely bs is real ?
<Dashes> i'd totally go on a murder spree every tiem if this happened :I
<OohShiny> WHY DOES LIFE HAS TO BE SO IRONIC!
<SlyTag> Deadlypon3 XD i agree fuck her
<Stormy`> there used to be some kind of inside joke here relating to me and Pikachu
<Zeus> emotionless
<Meth> tell it.
<AJfan77> ...
*Bronysith licks otakon17 and Bjornfot and MadScientIsht
<Stormy`> I don't remember what it was though
<Deadlypon3> Twilight_Sprinkle I dunno
<Reallylikehermane> these characters are terrible. the only one with development is the main one
<Sinestro> hes going to take his 5 million and get loads of bitches
<ChuYizus> lol applebloom quote
<Hat> Maybe there is a bleed effect for sentimentality
<SweetieG4K> i go on a raping spree
<brony655321> OH COME ON!
<Reallylikehermane> the others just suddenly radically change personality as the plot demands
<Deadlypon3> OH GOD HE HAS TO LIVE IT AGAIN
<otakon17> Goddammit
*MadScientIsht touches Bronysith
<AJfan77> face...palm?
<otakon17> Again!?
<Kandarihu> Alright. That part is rustling my mom's jimmies.
<Darf14> COME ON! Another repeat!
<Dashes> WHY THE FUCK IS IT NOT OVER
<Somberguy20> take the knife
<otakon17> Fucking really!?!!?
<Somberguy20> aim for the chast
<CriticKitten> Really? This is just dickish now.
<Raritydiamond> ?????????????????
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: you're back :3
<Agrold> ok, time for the last loop I guess?
<Raritydiamond> I honostly thought that was the end
<oni_link> da fuq
<Sumica> 00,10now it's the me time part of the loops
<AJfan77> load
<Somberguy20> kill yoself
<otakon17> ....
<Deadlypon3> A moral about letting go of things and letting people lvie there life? FUCK THAT SHIT!
<Zeus> damnit all to hell
<J_E_Smith71> Reallylikehermane: Well I hope the main character develops its the point of this type of story
<Rustymeat> what
<SlyTag> BREAK IT DOWN
<amatobrony> dafuq
<Reallylikehermane> ah, now we're in the mastering skills
<Darf14> my gosh there is no escape at all :(
<brony655321> Now we dance!
<Bipolarized> Fuck Christmas, go breakdance!
<Dashes> it's dragging out so long it's painful...
<CriticKitten> ....
<otakon17> He is learning to break dance
<Spazturtle> He is learning new skills
<twilight_sprinkle> the time-warp dance
<Gaige> dancing?
<oni_link> um okay
<OperatorPony> did the day repeat still?
<oni_link> why
<otakon17> Ooooooooookay
<Rookeealding> many loops actually, he's taking time to learn something.... not the lesson though
*thelonecubone noms on twilight_sprinkle :3
<Gaige> what the hellis happining
<Sumica> 00,10it's like where jack and t'elc learned to juggle
<alexxm> why
<otakon17> OperatorPony: Eeyup
<oni_link> why is this happening?
<Hat> Troll day repeats itself no matter how many lessons learnt
<Randomiser> He's gone crazy
*Bjornfot licks Bronysith and MadScientIsht and otakon17
<Deadlypon3> ...Why did he need to do this on the dirt?
<Cosmo> Bill Murray did it better when he learned to play the piano.
<Dashes> WHY IS THIS MOVIE NOT OVER
<Nyst> Ooh yeah, deliberately use the time to get perfect at everything.
<ChuYizus> filler time
<Sinestro> so if he kills himself it will still restart
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonecubone: yeah, been playing tf2 :P *nomz :3*
<AlienWarhead> Why didn't it end with the last loop that would have worked instead of this BS
<Cirno> spending the loop learning to dance. smart move indeed
<CriticKitten> Okay, so the movie realized that its runtime was too short and now we're padding this already-kinda-weak concept?
<Zeus> what in celestia's name is going on?!
<SlyTag> Awesome
<Reallylikehermane> did anyone read the fanfic of this with the Gala and blueblood?
<OohShiny> Remember Kevin?
<Fregy> I think this is multible days
<Gaige> he's got some mad skills
<TheVideoPonys> is this the..... end?
<Conyst> It's as if that's not the best place to do that.
<Fregy> right here
<OohShiny> He is a Choreaograph
<SlyTag> BEST PART OF THE MOVIE
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: I do need to get a good pc for that ;3;
<Deadlypon3> Cosmo You could literally learn anything with the loop thing when given enough time!
<Sinestro> "is the day over yet?" "no you killed maybe 20mins
<AJfan77> its NYAN CAT LOGIC
<Nyst> See, I'd use this loop to see the whole of the internet in a single day.
<Deadlypon3> And he learns...breakdancing
<Dashes> ...how long has this movie been? it feels like it's been dragging on for like 3 hours
<Ta_Dikin> Ded
<SaxyPretender> 0,14why is he dancing?
<Punkie_Pue> no, Reallylikehermane. iT any good?
<Sumica> 00,10the movie cant end till he dose all the things you normaly do on a time loop
<AlienWarhead> :S
*MadScientIsht brings down the morale of chat altogether
<twilight_sprinkle> his skils are so amazing he will break the space-time fabric and become free
<pony_300> that's a good question; when the day loops, does he keep the skills he learns?
<TrixieMuffin> ah finally a good use for a timeloop , become good at everything and be a god among men if you everget out of it
<pony_6381> There's an MLP fan fic with this?
<shadowboy8456> i saw the hobbit today
<Darf14> oh no, I hope they dont end the movie like this
<pony_6381> I kinda wanna read it now.
<Kammerjunk> Is he going to win with the power of break-dancing?
<Jageman> Does muscle memory carry over from loop to loop?
<shadowboy8456> it was amazing
<AJfan77> ITS NYAN CAT LOGIC
<Stormy`> I never named any of my pokemon
<Reallylikehermane> Well, it's groundhog day but with ponies. Prince Bluebood has the Gala loop over and over.
<otakon17> Again
<Cirno> crud, with the loops, he can afford the time to learn ANYTHING! twilight would love that
<Yozhel> -break dance with jeans-
<Dashes> HOW LONG IS THIS MOVIE?
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonecubone: my computer lags in tf2 too >.<
<Deadlypon3> Sumica The only other groundhog loop movie I like is about a kid reliving his worst christmas ever until he finds out why his father and uncle hate each other
<Zeus> emotionless...
<pony_6381> What's the name?
<AJfan77> Todd
<otakon17> Cirno: She would
<Ta_Dikin> Its like Bill murry Learning piano!
<Cosmo> I have all the time in the world. Should I use it to find a cure for cancer? Nah. I'll just learn to break dance.
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: lel, I hope you get a good pc as well :)
<Dashes> Ta_Dikin: only it's not cool :(
<Deadlypon3> Pony_6381 I dunno :p
<Sumica> 00,10stargate did best groundhog loop
<shadowboy8456> WHAT IS GOING ON
<J_E_Smith71> Dashes CriticKitten Yeah the cartoon special of this story only lasted 30 minutes
<Kandarihu> SaxyPretender, he's learning how to dance because he has all the free time he can ever want in the time loop.
<Ta_Dikin> Eeyup
<jcelios> Sumica: YUP
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonecubone: that probably wont happen
<Kraft58> Can this juse end
<AlienWarhead> Sumica: YES
<Agrold> yeah
<Reallylikehermane> its called the best night ever. (Same as the episode.)
<Spazturtle> Deadlypon3: There is one where everyday the world ends in a diferent way
<otakon17> Stop licking me dammit
<J_E_Smith71> Dashes: This one's 90 min
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: why ;3;
<Neotyguy40> No
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<oni_link> Dad: I love you. Kid: Me too. SCUMBAG KID
<pony_6381> I love this concept.
<Neotyguy40> I wish to be called Everto from her onwards
<Deadlypon3> Spazturtle ...Doesn't sound THAT bad
<Bronysith> otakon17: stop tasting like french fries and chocolate
<pony_6381> Of repeating days.
<Dashes> J_E_Smith71: seriously? it feels like it's been at least 2 hours >_<
<Ta_Dikin> @Sumica I agree
<AlienWarhead> Sumica: We should watch that
<Deadlypon3> ...OH MY GOD
<Hat> Skeptical Jill
<otakon17> Oh Gods this movie is about an hour too long
<Zeus> ...
<Jageman> be back later
<Kammerjunk> That's a strange mix, innit?
<Conyst> Sumica: you mean where Oneal and Tealc learn science
<Dashes> otakon17: seiously.
<CriticKitten> Dashes: That's because they're padding the SHIT out of this movie
<Everto> I dislike numbers at the end of my name
<Deadlypon3> "Your father is a dickless idiot."
<Sumica> 00,10yes that one.
<Midnight_Fyre> Nothing is strange with chocolate
<Dashes> CriticKitten: eeyup.
<shadowboy8456> commercials are better than this
<Deadlypon3> "I mean, sure, he is trying the best he can, BUT FUCK HIM!"
<Darf14> I have a bad feeling on what hes planning
<Everto> And Neotyguy40 came from Neopets
<SlyTag> Deadlypon3 XD I LOVE
<Kammerjunk> Eh, fair enough.
<Sumica> 00,10pea diddy
<SlyTag> U
<Sinestro> watch the day it doesnt loop he didnt get the lottery ticket
<oni_link> breakdancing
<Stormy`> Neopets!
<J_E_Smith71> Yeah this is what happens when you make a movie out of a short story you pad the hell out of it and drag it out
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonecubone: well my computer is sufficient for studies,and my father isnt thrilled about geting a new computer
<AJfan77> u no it high quality when there are voices but their mouths arent moving
<Conyst> Sumica: I loved that one.
<oni_link> okay
<brony655321> Pea Diddy.
<otakon17> Pea Diddy
<Everto> And why the heck has my name not changed?
<pony_6381> DEM MOVES

<OperatorPony> HAHA nice way to hide the stunt double
<Everto> Ah
<Kandarihu> So THIS is what the dance practice was for!
<Reallylikehermane> ok, so you can dance. But dancing in a suit like that surely requires more skill
<Kammerjunk> Must be hard to breakdance in a pea suit.
<Deadlypon3> SaxyPretender Its funny cause...he's wearing a dumb costume.
<Midnight_Fyre> I like the belch song better
<AlienWarhead> :DBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOO:D

<Sinestro> even the arnald Swarz movie is better
<oni_link> Gaige: this is pretty close acting wise. but birdemic is on a whole nother lever because of the CGI
<Rosfox> Sinestro: No kidding

<Sumica> 00,10jesus
<CriticKitten> Evil was DEFEATED
<Kandarihu> What? GOOD was defeated
<Darf14> so by that logic Jesus is evil
<Rookeealding> ...jerks much
*Bronysith carries Bjornfot and Kammerjunk away for PM, "not the place"
<Kammerjunk> Was he calling Jesus evil?
<AlienWarhead> That was a bad link sorry
<thelonecubone> AlienWarhead: Lel
<Welsh_Pony> Take that jesus
<Sinestro> fuck you dinkerberg
<CriticKitten> Jesus confirmed for EVIL

<Everto> Not to me, per se. But rather to a person I choose
<Sumica> 00,10spare time
<Zeus> god this acting
<Deadlypon3> When does he realize that his entire family is evil, and he is leaving his son to a horrible fate of being raised by them?
<oni_link> literally
<OohShiny> Poor evil jesus
<Darf14> I think the movie should have ended a long time ago
<Stormy`> So now you have to tell us
<Everto> And I choose Santa Claus
<Stormy`> what does your name mean?
<Raritydiamond> yup
<Zeus> ^
<X528> thbbvg
<Dashes> this should have ended ilke 30 mins ago
<Gaige> i cant agree more
<Everto> You must bow down to Santa Claus
<Bjornfot> Kammerjunk: Jesus was actually a pretty cool guy, but people are misinterpreting his words in evil ways, so you COULD say he is evil by proxy, but...
<CriticKitten> Darf14: Which makes its short runtime all the more hilarious!
<Sumica> 00,10lets go to the pub
<Orion> Winston churchill also said that he would walk this movie to the gates of hell and shake its hand
<Dashes> actually make that an hour
<Deadlypon3> Has a heart attack
<AJfan77> DinkelBUUUUUURRG
<OohShiny> The acting is bad, but the writing is FUCKING GENIUS!
<twilight_sprinkle> woosh

<Zeus> lol
<Cirno> what is this?
<Hat> Cosmo: you predicted it! Are you in a time loop of this movie?
<Sinestro> so to break the curse, he has to bail and not hang with them for half the day
<Darf14> now its dragging the dang plot >_<

<Conyst> very clever sir turn it into a plastic bug maker.
<Kammerjunk> Bjornfot: Ignoring all possible beliefs are going by the assumption he lived and preached the values written in the Bible, the problem is that like all intelligent people, he was probably not a straight thinker.

<Anger> ewww
<J_E_Smith71> What the heck? I didn't say the word.

<Dashes> so if he makes the kid feel like shit, he'll not wish for every day to be christmas and it'll end?
<OperatorPony> He still hasn't learned much...
<Kammerjunk> This mocha is perfect mix of chocolate and coffee, along with milk and just a dash of sugar.
<Randomiser> If Groundhog Day is the Hurricane, this movie is the Tornado
<Color_Cloud> HOW MUCH LONGER
<Meth> lol
<thelonecubone> otakon17: I use norton before, It depends on how much files you have in your computer and cpu usage

<pyrocatboy> -FAIL/10
<Kammerjunk> It really is.
<AJfan77> mute this and play winter wrap up
<Deadlypon3> Sumica So Did he do the break dancing, the singing, the oven...all in one day!?

<Color_Cloud> I DONT BELEIVE IN SANTA CUZ I STAYED UP WATCHING FOR SANTA AND MY MUM PUT OUT GIFTS THAT SAID FROM SANTA FAIL.
<Everto> I have no idea where the 40 came from though
<Kandarihu> I'll bet the Tornado is the key to ending this Christmas Loop, as long as the kid wishes to just get over with it.
<Kammerjunk> And it looks amazing.
<Dashes> 99 buckets of oats in its entirity would be better than this :S
<Tex> Liek a tornaaadooh!

<Raritydiamond> Mcintosh speaks other than eyup
<Donkey> OPEN THE CASE
<Squallken> what about the rainbow apples
<Ponyguy> FYI Flim Flam means scam
<Color_Cloud> THEY ARE CHANGLINGS
<Stormy`> I thought when you were cleaning up your keyboard you were reacting in shock to Meth's suggestion
<Color_Cloud> GASP
<Bronysith> anyways, flim flam just means ripping off
<Meth> That's what I thought.
<Everto> Lol

<Kammerjunk> Goddesses bless the free markey, eh?
<Dashes> Changelings are an entire race of alicorns :I

<SouthernSweet> Interesting to watch and think about the risk of them losing the farm now that we KNOW the parents are dead. :(
<fleskywood> nuffer

<Sumica> 00,10is't AB a bit young to be serving booze?
<Meth> Spyrorocks reacted better than I thought.
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: It' a good thing nopony in Equestria owns a dictionary.
<CCharmanderK> Flim and Flam can be dicks, but I see where they're coming from. Being travelling cider makers must be tough, as they never have an apple orchard of their own.
<oni_link> Squallken: I want
<Zeus> nope
<Gaiges> no
<Reallylikehermane> Shes 21ish.

<Darf14> ...everytime I see this now I see Faithful Farmer
<Kammerjunk> True.
<Everto> I'm not doing this
<Meth> what is A/S/L?
<Donkey> Is it considered uncouth to not wear horseshoes in Equestria?
<Color_Cloud> crap

<oni_link> I really like AJ in this episode
<SouthernSweet> @brony655321, YES!!

<Dashes> SouthernSweet: wibbly wobbly
<CCharmanderK> Badun Goodun
<J_E_Smith71> CCharmanderK: And that contest in the Disney verison of Paul Bunyan where Paul had to show a guy with a steam powered chain saw that the old way was the best
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, Sweet Apple Acres is a monopoly.
<oni_link> Time Turner but everyone refers to him as Doctor Whooves, myself included
<fleskywood> timey wimey stuffs
<SouthernSweet> @Dashes I like it.

<shadowboy8456> Docter Whooves?
<CCharmanderK> Applejack: Aw, buck.
<Donkey> 1:6 ratio
<Zeus> dat engineering
<otakon17> Yeah official name is Hooves
<Stormy`> people still do A/S/L?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: still, they dont have a choice since apparently they need the money or they get run out of the business
<Dashes> Time Turner is the "John Smith" of Equestria :D
<Rosfox> Isn't his name Dr. Hooves?
<otakon17> Doctor Hooves
<VenHur> This reminded me of something...We never seen Cider Attack gameplay for a long time now!
<Afflict> constantly
<Color_Cloud> dr whooves
<Stormy`> thought that died back before the myspace era
<LeGoMeEGGO> she's overdosing
<Meth> How do you do A/S/L?
<otakon17> Yeah his name is Hooves
<Dashes> it's just his "John Smith" name :P
<Raritydiamond> Well at least the creators care about their fanbase unlike many shows today:)
<Afflict> just say asl
<twilight_sprinkle> robots are superior!
<Donkey> Flim and Flam are 6 times as fast
<Bronysith> eh
<Bipolarized> Time to cheat!
<SlyTag> RARITY IS BEST PONY!!!
<marley> Ya know you actually have to age cider or all you have is applejuice
<Bronysith> this show is so inconsistent it hurts
<Ivy> How is this supposed to be alcohol. This is clearly Apple Juice ! FAKE !
<Fregy> I never understood why they didin't just refuse to sell apples to the flimflams?
<CrystalPhoenix> I really hate how you guess make up reason to protect your precious fanon facts
<Fregy> Anyone?
<Sumica> 00,10it's not cheating if they dont care.
<magmablock> Think for a sec, if they said no right here, things would have turned out quite differently
<Dashes> SlyTag: funny way to spell "Rainbow Dash"

<Meth> I beat you in Pokemon, Rival
<CCharmanderK> WOAH
<Reallylikehermane> At the rate they were producing and such, they might even have won if they just remained at normal speed and didnt ruin it by turning off quality control
<Ta_Dikin> FlutterTree!!!!!!
<otakon17> RD presses Big Mac in her sleep
<Meth> 40,m,texas?
<Donkey> DO U EVEN PRESS
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, they can't survive as a company under the terms that the Flim Flam Brothers insisted on. If they would budge on the cut, then they could form a partnership.
<CCharmanderK> Look at Fluttershy GO!!
<SlyTag> Dashes http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw5244-come_at_me_darling.jpg
<Bronysith> hey, hey twilight

<Kammerjunk> Like in Applebuck Season.
<Stormy`> my fiance used to always respond "50/M/NYC"
<Kimori> congrats Meth
<Color_Cloud> Fluttershy as a tree is already canon
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: possibly, they didnt really say how much of the money they need
<shadowboy8456> 15 barrels
<otakon17> Sumica: Typical pegasus
<SlyTag> Twilight is SLACKING
<Jazmyn> gooodah badah
<SouthernSweet> @Dashes, Yeah. Hasbro couldn't get the rights to rename him Dr. Whooves, but they did change it to Dr. Hooves in honor of the fans.
<brony655321> Same reason Scootaloo does?
<Stormy`> and everyone would disconnect immediately
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Maybe she thinks that'll make it go faster?
<twilight_sprinkle> huzzah
<CCharmanderK> DOUBLE THE POWAH!

<Color_Cloud> Discussion: What is your favorite pony shipping?

<Bronysith> nopony is best pony
<pony_3238> Princess Cadence
<Sparklerific> chocalate chip pony
<Color_Cloud> Spike is best pony
<DocSane> Twist is clearly the best one.

<DocSane> Bronysith: Cadence is so powerful you can literally throw her at any problem.
<twilight_sprinkle> and silver spoon
<Color_Cloud> Discussion: Did you get any pony related items during the holidays?
<Sparklerific> we must see twist in this next episode: She represents a candycane for the holidays
<Color_Cloud> none for me
<Karonia> NOPE
<Bronysith> DocSane: she is such a shoehorned in character like shining armor it hurts
<SuperBrony64> 11,02best pony is derpy :3
<DocSane> Color_Cloud: Yes, all embarrassing. Next.
<Karonia> Lol nope
<KrazyNoobs> Fluttershy is best pony
<DHasFluttershy> In my opinion, it's Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy
<Color_Cloud> Discussion: Who is best pegasus?
<KrazyNoobs> Well, I cannot decide between purple smart, Fluttershy and Derpy
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: do you think cadance and shining armor are shoehorned in or just stupid business scheme?
<Bronysith> or both?
<Color_Cloud> Fluttershy for me
<KrazyNoobs> But in Season 3, my fav is Pinkie
<DocSane> Bronysith: Yes, but remember that this is Hasbro's show, and they wanted a new pinkl princess to sell.
<DHasFluttershy> One mustn't just simply pick ONE favorite pony. :c
<Derpy_Hooves> SuperBrony64 \:3/
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: business as in for merch selling?
<Sparklerific> name your favorite side character that you want to see more of... besides luna
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea
<KrazyNoobs> Ironic that Gaben's fav pony is Pinkie Pie, yet Season 3 Episode 3 was Too Many Pinkie Pies.
<ShinitaiHana> no midnight stream?
<Color_Cloud> Discussion: What inspired you to becom a brony/pegasister?
<DocSane> Bronysith: Considering the big brother ponies in G1 were introduced in EXACTLY the same shoehorned-in way, I'll just consider it an MLP tradition.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: possibly both, maybe just shoe-horned in
<fleskywood> wtf?
<Meth> selinna25 is a spammer :O
<DocSane> Bronysith: "Hey, here's a big brother we've never mentioned before. Let's sing about how awesome they are!"
<DHasFluttershy> What inspired me to become a pegasister, is by looking up the fandom
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i mean "i love my big brother so much, thats why i never tell my best friends ever"
<Bronysith> lols
<Everto> http://i44.servimg.com/u/f44/17/14/57/39/haha_n10.jpg

<fleskywood> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> im just in it for the cute lively colofrful horiseies

<Bronysith> all the villains suck compared to the joker or kefka
<Color_Cloud> Discussion: Have you had nightmears with ponies?
<Meth> What is the maximum size for sigs?
<Punkie_Pue> I think bronystate did a good job at keeping g situation under control
<ShinitaiHana> I tried v.v
<fleskywood> it is a chat that i happen to like anyway
<spitfirecolt> with coffee talk as his sidekick
<Technicality> Color_Cloud: yes, unfortunately I have

<Meth> Oh

<Spyrorocks> theres a physical size limit, it will make the sig scroll if its too big.
<Stormy`> Here: http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-1060-read-signatures.html

<plp855> ('-(\
<Bronysith> god this fandom =_=
<Punkie_Pue> a spy!
<Dauven> Hey!
<plp855> pinkie pie is best forth wall breaker
<Dauven> Is anybody still down to watch some ponies?
<Bronysith> plp855: false on so many levels
<plp855> yup
<Bronysith> plp855: animaniacs are best 4th wall breakers
<plp855> whay y
<Color_Cloud> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljSwzCI7zb0dammit, a friend of mine sent me this video. goodbye sleep.
<Dauven> I'm not sure if it's against rules to post links to outside streams.
<Dauven> I was going to stream some post-movie-night-ponies if anybody wanted to get in on it.
<KrazyNoobs> Wow, stuffs happening in the Spike room
<plp855> ... ponies
<plp855> the end
<Punkie_Pue> the animaniacs control the fifth wall.
<Bronysith> MLP is not the best written animated tv show of all time, it is great animation with decent writings, but Animaniacs and Batman the Animated series are the best animated series ever
<Amaron> No Wall-E? :<
<Amaron> l
<Bronysith> well written, well animated and consistent
<Bronysith> lovely
<thelonecubone> That was hours ago
<Dauven> Bronysith: I'm pretty partial to Avatar The Last Airbender.
<twilight_sprinkle> meh not a fan of animaniacs myself
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i get that
<Amaron> Darn, I knew I would get the times mixed up.
<Amaron> Ah well.
<Dauven> Bronysith: Have you seen Gravity Falls yet?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i just find it fun
<Meth> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-384525.html#384525
<Color_Cloud> goodnight guys see ya tommorow for episode
<twilight_sprinkle> and avatar had one of the worst and most cliche endings ever
<Punkie_Pue> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDtdQ8bTvRc
<plp855> i like curoge the cowerdly dog
<Bronysith> Dauven: it looks fun, but animaniacs and batman TAS is much better
<Bronysith> *are
<Dauven> twilight_sprinkle: I didn't think it was a bad ending.

<Bronysith> Also, korra gets way too much love, all because it is steampunk
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: which one, Korra or Last?
<thelonecubone> that square spam
<plp855> never seen kora
<twilight_sprinkle> Dauven: i thought it was terrible because he pretty much just went avatar mode and beat the crap out of the big bad last boss, no need for 3 seasons of "important" lessons before it
<Dauven> Bronysith: Korra has nicer show feel and animation.
<twilight_sprinkle> thelonecubone: Lasr
<Bronysith> Dauven: sucks
<fleskywood> noone sees zalgo text?
<thelonecubone> twilight_sprinkle: ah
<Bronysith> korra sucks
<Bronysith> so much
<Punkie_Pue> i do
<pony_6381> Korra's pretty decent.
<plp855> FUS RO DA

<Dauven> Bronysith: Last Airbender trashes it in terms of plot.
<Bronysith> plp855: kill yourself
<twilight_sprinkle> fleskywood: we see it, but im not sure if its allowed
<plp855> no
<Bronysith> Dauven: which is the most important part
<Dauven> But you can't deny the better quality animation.
<fleskywood> is iy?
<pony_6381> I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece but I enjoyed it. Original much better though.
<fleskywood> is it*
<Bronysith> plp855: that is a terrible fucking meme that gives a good game a terrible name
<Meth> JOIN THE CAMPAIGN!
<Dauven> Or the tone and feeling the show carries throughout its episodes.
<Stormy`> lol seriously dude?
<Dauven> Its weak points are its plots and characters.
<Meth> yup
<pony_6381> And yeah, the animation is gorgeous.
<Stormy`> You know I'm just going to have to move that to spam, right?
<Dauven> And ultimately its believability is compromised along the way.
<plp855> i took an arrow to the knee
<Technicality> 8,05good evening, #bronystate
<twilight_sprinkle> i wouldnt say the last airbender had such a great story
<Meth> Yeah.
<thelonecubone> Hi Technicality
<Dauven> Good evening, Technicality!
<Meth> But postphone the move
<pony_6381> Yeah, the character were okay, but they weren't quite memorable.
<Kandarihu> Good evening Technicality.

<Dauven> The Last Airbender was great because of the character development.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: still better than korra, and Zuko is probably my fav tragic character
<Shinitai> Hello^
<Dauven> The story was pretty straightforward.
<texasboykc09> Technicality, hello and get rid of the color
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ive not seen that much of korra, i wouldnt know, altho from the bits i saw the story seemed more or less fine
<Meth> What code do I put for an Image on my sig?
<Technicality> texasboykc09: not a thing could ever make me do so ^_^
<Dauven> Man I really wanna' watch ponies with some folks!
<thelonecubone> Dauven: now i want to see Last airbender again ;-;

<Buytoast> Horses are forbidden.
<thelonecubone> and*
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: maybe, i only saw until the ep where the girls dad turned out to work for the bad guys
<Buytoast> AHAHA

<Method> lol are you gonna go?
<Spyrorocks> I dont know if I should go or not though, I might be too weirded out.
<AdamTheDuck> Unless you're Sumica
<killerpony7733> Applecrisp Try not sleeping for many hours straight and all. You'll end up dying
<AdamTheDuck> Then you don't need sleep.
<Dusky> all you can eat... ya, I passed out with a food coma
<thelonecubone> He's right
<Stormy`> speaking from experience
<DashWithRainbows> Nope, Sumi sleeps.
<Stormy`> conventions are pretty weird
<Shinitai> I'm just now noticing TheOtakuAscended channel disapeared
<Method> yeah'
<Dusky> aren't all the bs mods sleeping right now?

<killerpony7733> probably*
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: to lurk well you just dont say shit

<Dusky> twilight_sprinkle: it's really easy
<berberborscing> But it's really epic
<Bronysith> berberborscing: its just a bad picture
<Dusky> just ask yourself what would discord do
<Stormy`> You are really serious about this
<Stormy`> huh
<berberborscing> Oh, need a picture of the videogame box or something?
<Method> This is for a different forum site.
<Bronysith> berberborscing: no, i know about that game
<twilight_sprinkle> Dusky: but he would do anything
<Stormy`> aw, your avatar is cute on that forum
<Method> I am a professional troll ;)
<Bronysith> berberborscing: its just a bad pic

<Method> Thanks.
<Method> It is my pet

<Spyrorocks> I think meth = furry.
<berberborscing> A lot of stuff going on, makes quality a hard goal to reach
<Method> Me? I might become one
<Stormy`> totally
<Dusky> twilight_sprinkle: he would not
<Stormy`> that would explain everything
<berberborscing> Even my game lagged during that battle
<Spyrorocks> Bronies are like, one step above furries.
<Spyrorocks> but just by a little bit.
<berberborscing> That bastard kept switching between Physical Tol and Magic Tol
<Everto> Lol
<Everto> I think they're a step below
<twilight_sprinkle> Dusky: he would do something unexpected, but if you could guess what it would be then it wouldnt be unexpected enough for him
<Dusky> with great power comes inherent laziness, let that be your guiding light, twilight_sprinkle
<Method> lol
<Everto> I'll probably get kicked for this
<Everto> But if you like ponies, great
*Bronysith suplexes twilight_sprinkle with lagann
<Bronysith> yay~
<AdamTheDuck> Dusky, words of wisdom
<Everto> If you shout to the world you like ponies, that's a cry for attention
<Everto> Furries don't cry for attention
<Everto> They yiff for it
*twilight_sprinkle explodes

<Bronysith> Bronies= one of the worst fandoms ever
<thelonecubone> like every fandom out there
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: eh it was just something to latch on to to kill time during the ads, and 4 straights ads of it sealed the deal
<Ninjazz> Ever fandom is terrible.
<thelonecubone> :>
<Ninjazz> Every*
<Ninjazz> Bronies just think they're special because everyone keeps talking about them.
<berberborscing> So is the ninjazz fandom.

<Ninjazz> berberborscing, D:
<AdamTheDuck> Ninjazz fandom is best fandom D:

<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah, it seems like a theory that could work, although i was thinking more that once you go back, you can never return to your own timeline, only a similar one if you try to make, because if youve gone back, your existance has already changed the future, so you would already be in a dif timeline no matter what

<DoctoDoctorWho> Why did the nurse cross the road?
<KrazyNoobs3> #Spike is absolute chaos, lol
<texasboykc09> Wrek, where did you get the background image from
<berberborscing> I dunno, dammit why are you asking me?
<tak025> lol
<Gloomfury> good song.
<Barbetos> well you have all the answers.
<DoctoDoctorWho> To get to the dead kid in the middle, duh. :|
<Wrek> 05MirrorImage: it was in my megasmoothalist anyways
<tak025> :D
<berberborscing> Being a hater, now that's illegal
<Invoker> MirrorImage: are you ytpmver?
<MirrorImage> no
<MirrorImage> why?
<Invoker> MirrorImage: cause there's a famous ytpmver caller mirrorimage lol
<Invoker> called*
<MirrorImage> yeah, i seem to be stumbling upon that issue as of recently
<berberborscing> OMG
<thelonecubone|MW2> Okay, I just receive a message with the leviosah audio :O
<berberborscing> ITS SLENDER MANE
<thelonecubone|MW2> :D*
<DoctoDoctorWho> I've just had a recent facination with skyrim, but every time I try to talk about it, the conversation takes off without me. *sigh*
<MirrorImage> skyrim is starting to lose its interest at this point
<MirrorImage> it's no longer "the" big new thing
<Colt_Norris> yeah
<Gloomfury> agreed
<berberborscing> Black Ops 2 and Halo 4 are new things now
<jijonbreaker> skyrim burned out a while back, really...
<Colt_Norris> arrow to the knee joke become even old in like 3 months
<twilight_sprinkle> de, beatles
<twilight_sprinkle> dem*
<DoctoDoctorWho> It's still an awesome game, its just not frontline news
<jijonbreaker> arrow to the knee got old in a couple weeks...
<Colt_Norris> still better than copy paste 2
<Colt_Norris> i mean
<Colt_Norris> black ops 2
<thelonecubone|MW2> berberborscing: I dont give a sheet, I love old games :I
<jijonbreaker> the only thing that has EVER gotten old faster than arrow to the knee was gak
<berberborscing> I do too
<berberborscing> I love .hack series
<berberborscing> and thats like 10 years old
<jijonbreaker> ...
<thelonecubone|MW2> never played it
<Gloomfury> anyone get farcry 3?
<thelonecubone|MW2> :/
<DoctoDoctorWho> jijonbreaker: that was old b4 it started
<Colt_Norris> gak jokes lived like 1 day
<thelonecubone|MW2> and i tried to stop it ;3;
<swack26> life goes on
<berberborscing> I was told mayflies live for 8 minutes. :(
<Colt_Norris> far cry 3 i think is good
<Sunburn> Everyone Tried to stop it...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Currently I have full exquisite dwarven armor with a warhammer to match.
<Sunburn> Far cry a nice game
<swack26> I don;t get it
<berberborscing> A review for it said "Skyrim with guns!"
<DoctoDoctorWho> lvl 15
<swack26> I mean farcry 1 was aboutn a trpical island full of alter genteic monsters
<berberborscing> I almost typed Shyrim...
<Wrek> 05i dislike skyrim
<Wrek> 05i love fallout though
<Gloomfury> why?
<swack26> farcry 2 is in africa with not much plot
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek: reasoning?
<Champion_of_Harmony> Skyrim withguns huh? *thinks* isnt that called fallout?
<Sunburn> Why dont you liek skyrim?
<SlackerTheHacker187> Hello
<Wrek> 05casue in fallout it in most cases doesnt matter what armor you wear.
<Colt_Norris> some one here send their mail to get the dead space 3 early acces to demo on xbox live?
<Wrek> 05i can walk around in rags and still survive
<jijonbreaker> I don't dislike skyrim, it's just not really my thing.
<Wrek> 05in skyrim im toast
<swack26> remeber the farcry Instince arc?
<berberborscing> You know how all the losers at school say they got swag?
<Kandarihu> Well Skyrim is demanding more of a GPU than my laptop has.
<Sunburn> Well that just means Skyrims more chalenging
<Wrek> 05i should go to bed so i wake up in time for episode
<the_real_pony_1604> thats why I have a bad ass glass armor set in skyrim. so I can still move around but have a chance to survive a shot
<Wrek> 05Sunburn: on the contrary
<swack26> wher the main character of Farcry 1 was mutated into an animal like super soldiers?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wrek: I happen to like that aspect about it, if armor is all aesthetic, whats the point?
<berberborscing> 50 years ago, Swag meant "Secretly We Are Gay"
<Kandarihu> And that's why it's off my wishlist... Dark Souls, too.
<Mr_Anybody> herro everyone
<Mr_Anybody> I live
<DoctoDoctorWho> berberborscing: and at that same time, gay still ment happy.
<Wrek> 05DoctoDoctorWho: because if im skilled enough in fallout to survive with an armor that doesnt have a high DT, killing foes by out witting them
<swack26> i mean it was awesomto beable to stalk your emeny and claw thier face off with your bare hands in Farcry Instinct
<Wrek> 05im not restricted
<Wrek> 05and the armor becomes and asthetic
<Wrek> 05its wanted
<berberborscing> Swag was originally a saying used from 1950 to 1980 to portray gay people who needed to be in the closet because﻿ of the society they lived in...today the saying has been severely skewered by modern society. from secret homosexual lingo, to completely retarded ghetto talk. -DJanthro
<Flootahshy> HAY GUYS
<Wrek> 05but not *required*
<Ninjazz> You main an assassin type char usually, Wrek?
<Spyrorocks> those guys are hilarious
<Sunburn> Well everyone had there opinions so i wont juge
<Mr_Anybody> why are people talking about swag and gay?
<Wrek> 05if im a killing character
<DerpyMuffins> You gonna finish the DLC Wrek?
<Wrek> 05always a knife, a small arms pistol of type and a sniper rifle
<Wrek> 05otherwise i tend to lean towards a high speech/medicine/science char
<Wrek> 05using a small pistol and some melee weapon
<Wrek> 05usually relyign on a companion to kill the deathclaws
<Ninjazz> Oh. More of charasma guy then.
<Ninjazz> Charisma*
<berberborscing> Favorite weapon in Black Ops 1 not black ops 2 :( Double Desert Eagles
<Mr_Anybody> that awkward moment where only wrek talks
<swack26> umm Desrt egal is not in any black ops
<DoctoDoctorWho> Well I guess it all boils down to opinion and playstyle, so the arguement's void. I personally like heavy armor and getting up close and kicking ass in meelee, Im guessing your a stealth/long range character Wrek?
<the_real_pony_1604> When Wrek speaks, people shut up
<tak025> :D
<Sunburn> lol
<Mr_Anybody> agreed
<berberborscing> My friend has it, not me, so it may be MW2 to MW3
<Mr_Anybody> eww
<swack26> tthats the series
<Wrek> 05Behave and you ahve nothign to fear from me.
<swack26> that has the Degal
<Wrek> 05except my blatant lack of sleep typos
<Mr_Anybody> ALL HAIL LORD WREK!
<Mr_Anybody> :3
<Ninjazz> I don't see why everyone keeps shitting their pants when Wrek talks. :/ He's a cool guy. Nothing to fear.
<Sunburn> :P
<Wrek> 05lets see
*Mr_Anybody jimmies are very rustled
<Wrek> 05ive scripted so that le lenny is a kick...
<Wrek> 05spam is active aswell as gak
<the_real_pony_1604> because he is a bad ass artest. and historically that also means they are bat shit crazy
<Wrek> 05what else is needed for tomorrows shitstorm
<Phase4> 00,02Berrypunch is offline again
<Phase4> 00,02this is really anoying
<texasboykc09> Phase4, what does berrypunch do?
<Ninjazz> the_real_pony_1604, I thought it'd be more because of the fact that he's a bisexual viking but okay.
<Mr_Anybody> stuff
<Phase4> 00,02texasboykc09, just spamkicks right now
<Phase4> 00,02i plan to have it do more later
<Gloomfury> whats this song?
<Mr_Anybody> very nice job
<Mr_Anybody> he/she must take it very seriously *end sarcasm*
<texasboykc09> Wrek, kicks for text walls
<pony117> le lenny
<Mr_Anybody> can we break text walls into paragraphs and not get kicked?
<the_real_pony_1604> finally a song I know. WOOT!
<Wrek> 05the max limit of characters kinda fix that
<Mr_Anybody> :/
<Wrek> 05Phase4: wish there was a way to ban links
<berberborscing> not when i uploaded one link
<berberborscing> Wrek does this count as a stream? i really wanna put up a video link
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, that is something i'm looking at
<Biggysweet> Godsmack
<Biggysweet> They are really good live, i have seen them twice
<Mr_Anybody> once i uploaded a link that took up the entire chat page, then i found out it was a google search result link :$
<Wrek> 05berberborscing: yes but its jsut a test really
<texasboykc09> Wrek, what the limit fir characters
<Wrek> 05will go down once igo to sleeps
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, actually what i'm looking at is autokicks based of regular expressions,so i can have it yell at those silly people who paste google image links
<Mr_Anybody> :(
<Mr_Anybody> aww
<Wrek> 05was gona make a simple anti youtube one
<Mr_Anybody> no more rustle jimmie pictures?
<berberborscing> lol
<Wrek> 05but sadly its hard to set exceptions
<Sunburn> i dont know rather to sleep or pull a all nighter
*Mr_Anybody 's jimmies are now very rustled
<Wrek> 05and term it so people saying "go to youtube" doesnt get affected
<berberborscing> jgjgj
<Wrek> 05a simple one is banning http://
<Wrek> 05but thats jsut silly
<the_real_pony_1604> just have to set the filter for youtube to be www.youtube
<DoctoDoctorWho> I just found the single most, hands down, badass play ever.
<Mr_Anybody> hamlet?
<texasboykc09> Wrek, if is helps, go for it
<Kandarihu> youtube.c or youtu.be
<texasboykc09> think it not silly
<berberborscing> that bans like all pages
<Derpy_Hooves> wrek: people try getting around the kag thing by going: "G@k, G/-\k ect
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<Mr_Anybody> "ect."
<Derpy_Hooves> nvm you got that covered :V
<DoctoDoctorWho> Imagine if hamlet, were written by orks.
<texasboykc09> Derpy_Hooves, i think he has that coverd
<Mr_Anybody> needless to say, Hamlet was a pretty badass play, very gory too
<Derpy_Hooves> wrek, phase, lots people in the dash room spam the <3 like crazy
<texasboykc09> Derpy_Hooves, ikr
<Derpy_Hooves> talkbing about 8 to 11 hearts in one go
<the_real_pony_1604> there was a playhouse production of evil dead here in my area a couple years ago. it was pretty awesome in a cheap production sort of way
<texasboykc09> ^^
<Mr_Anybody> but i <3 the <3 buttom
<Mr_Anybody> button*
<texasboykc09> Derpy_Hooves, the rainbow dash channel is the most active and wild pf all the side channels
<Derpy_Hooves> there are also the russian speakers
<texasboykc09> of*
*berberborscing
<Derpy_Hooves> texasboykc09: i know, i help mod it on saturdays :I
<Mr_Anybody> no one goes to spike, i feel bad for it
<texasboykc09> Derpy_Hooves, i wish i can help to
<berberborscing> Who wants to palce song requests?
<Flootahshy> Mr_Anybody: Isnt that the one without IRC?
<the_real_pony_1604> this is why I go to Rarity, because it is a calmer board
<Mr_Anybody> i think so
<Flootahshy> Mr_Anybody: Then how would you know if anyone went there?
<Mr_Anybody> anything barely happens in spike i hear
<berberborscing> Pinkie Pie was just perfect for me
<berberborscing> Not too loud and not too quiet
<Derpy_Hooves> but yeah, Wrek, Phase4, the <3 spam, russian language spam, oh yeah the constant "nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo" spam
<Sunburn> i like crazy
<Derpy_Hooves> those are the most troublesome ones
<Derpy_Hooves> adding a script for those (if possible) would ease things up
<Wrek> 05thing is
<Phase4> 00,02i may also try check for emote spam
<Wrek> 05theyre not the smae person
<berberborscing> the ones where everyone types /me licked (some random guy)
<Wrek> 05same*
<Derpy_Hooves> im aware
<Wrek> 05in 90% of the cases
<Wrek> 05sso that needs ot be manually covered
<Derpy_Hooves> if you say so
<Mr_Anybody> man, when did people start laying down the law here?
<Wrek> 05Mr_Anybody: we always have
<Phase4> 00,02well i don't plan to do any bans automatically
<Wrek> 05we learn
<Wrek> 05adapt
<Phase4> 00,02that'd just be silly and anoying
<Wrek> 05adn generalyl improve
<Wrek> 05and yeah autobans wont happen
<Wrek> 05sortign those manually is easier
<Derpy_Hooves> well the only one that gets really bothers are the long ass "no" messages
<berberborscing> Automatic bans may tend to mess up and ban for typing three characters: that happened in one of my servers when I typed: can i have some wood
<Mr_Anybody> XD
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, well i do have some ideas for automatically managing bans but they're for later
<fleskywood> 13,6 no moar lightIRC
<Phase4> 00,02it wont create any on it's own
<Derpy_Hooves> i can usually handle the emote, and russian spam
<berberborscing> It's difficult for others not to use /me
<Wrek> 05that color combo was suprisingly ugly to read
<Derpy_Hooves> the nooooooo walls are quiet troublesome though
<fleskywood> okay
<Derpy_Hooves> what else...
<fleskywood> no more lightIRC
<texasboykc09> Wrek, ikr

<texasboykc09> Phase4, how about purple text on your blue background
<Mr_Anybody> water obviously

<brokenCrowning> i am the happy
<Ninjazz> Wait wut. It's a Spike AND Applejack episode? Are you kidding me?
<thelonecubone|MW2> no
<berberborscing> the CMC has more episodes than AJ
<Wrek> 05not for anotehr 8 hours ZeroPwny
<FlutterDash31> lol
<ZeroPwny> Kay thanks
<Ninjazz> We traded Rarity's fabulous episodes for those two?
<thelonecubone|MW2> well, Bye ^w^
<Rex_Mundi> hello everypony
<FlutterDash31> yes
<ZeroPwny> Damn
<NocturnalBlade> ohai Rex_Mundi
<Wrek> 05you cannot trust EqD to be on time
<brokenCrowning> maybe rarity gets a good part in the season finale
<Wrek> 05never
<ZeroPwny> Well might as well stay up!
<Ninjazz> I blame Seth.
<ZeroPwny> Got nothing better to do.
<Mr_Anybody> which one of you numbnuts let us down?!
<berberborscing> In the season finales, everyone knows Twilight gets the main role
<ZeroPwny> I seriously have no idea what day is it.
<Ninjazz> brokenCrowning, but the thing is...she steals the episode. But the episode is never fully about her.
<brokenCrowning> i agree rarity needs more episodes
<KrazyNoobs3> i'm back
<brokenCrowning> but she got so many in season 2
<Rex_Mundi> Rarity is best pony
<Rex_Mundi> just sayin
<KrazyNoobs3> Rarity is awesome pony
<Ninjazz> ^^^^^^^
<berberborscing> well, only 7 more episodes left in Season 3...
<KrazyNoobs3> I think episode about her could have potential
<ZeroPwny> But not as awesome as Rainbow Dash
<FlutterDash31> ^
<texasboykc09> ^^
<Mr_Anybody> I have to go to some sort of hockey game on monday, minor is the only hockey I'll get this year
<brokenCrowning> those are wierd names to spell pinkie pie
<KrazyNoobs3> I miss Rainbow Dash's old personality

<Mr_Anybody> Doctor Who

<ZeroPwny> Never liked anime
<Ninjazz> Breaking Bad, Walking Dead.
<Mr_Anybody> and occasionally walking dead
<berberborscing> I used to like Deadman Wonderland...
<ZeroPwny> But I agree with the Doctor Who thing
<FlutterDash31> twd
<brokenCrowning> walking dead is good but also meh at the same times
<Rex_Mundi> uh... My little pony?... damnit, its supposed to be a non-MLP show.
<Mr_Anybody> but I'm all about the 10th doctor
<Ninjazz> Sometimes Iron Chef.
<Wrek> 05im a die hard old school cartoon fan
<ZeroPwny> 10th doctor is best doctor
<GabeMoist> I like Cromartie High School
<berberborscing> then choose animaniacs
<Wrek> 05tune in on stream durign a cartoon session and omg nostalgia
<Timberwolf> I cant wait for new DC nation block

<AppleCrisp> gnight
<Rex_Mundi> OK guys, im not much of a shipper, i dont pretend thats theres any romance between the characters to find between the lines. But if the was a ship that I wuldnt mind turned out to be true, then its rarijack.
<Ninjazz> Sleep well Wrek.
<Mr_Anybody> or at least for me
<Mr_Anybody> go to bed you lazy bum
<brokenCrowning> i dont ship

<SuperBrony64> 11,02\^-^/
<brokenCrowning> MOW APPO FWITTUW
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, anything with Rarity in it is a pretty interesting ship. But polar opposites like those two work...interestingly.
<Mr_Anybody> someone needs to kidnap the stream
<Mr_Anybody> SUPERBRONY!
<GabeMoist> SuperBrony64, \^-^/
<brokenCrowning> Like what 4chan did before?
<texasboykc09> SuperBrony64, hello mooo

<Wrek> 05firstly it wasnt 4chan, it wasnt /v/ it wasnt GNAA
<AppleCrisp> apl fwittier
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: Rarijack is much perferable to say, Fancypants X rarity, or... God forbid, SpikeXRarity
<Mr_Anybody> wut the hacked stream?
<Wrek> 05it was a good for nothign streamsite wanting to steal viewers
<Mr_Anybody> i remember that
<Wrek> 05secondly the ydidnt hack
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, oh... the only "canon" ship. :D
<Wrek> 05turns out our old provider provided the key to stream to it isnide its embedd
<Wrek> 05you jsut had to look at our sites code and voila
<Wrek> 05so it was a hijack
<Wrek> 05at best
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: NO... Spike has no chance at all with Rarity.
<Mr_Anybody> the off air pictures are making my typing laggy
<FlutterDash31> best hijack ever?
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: Fancy pants is too minor and is too old as well.
<turp> aren't you trying to sleep Wrek?
<Wrek> 05i am.
<FlutterDash31> yea
<swack26> lame
<berberborscing> try to type with your eyelids closed

<Wrek> 05magic.
<AppleCrisp> its hard to leave chats:)
<FlutterDash31> ^
<Mr_Anybody> HEY HEY HEY! moo
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo o3o
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, I know. But I like how people support it even though. Rarity and Fluttershy seem like they got a good shot, seeing as how they're best friends and do a lot of things together.
<berberborscing> got mr is pretty east
<texasboykc09> AppleCrisp, ifr
<Rex_Mundi> DoctoDoctorWho: He is. But not right for my rarity.
<Mr_Anybody> moo indeed my dear watson
<Spyrorocks> http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8a1_1356707859
<texasboykc09> SuperBrony64, moo
<berberborscing> I just typed "For me it's pretty easy" with my eyes closed.
<richfiles> I remember the weird singing orange... Surprisingly relevant to the antics of the prior Too Many Pinkie Pie episode, what witht he weird oranges! :D
<taoumi> right. need music
<Mr_Anybody> I'm tyuping with my eyes closed
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: Hmmm... I dont see FluttershyXRarity working, for some reason.
<Mr_Anybody> are there any mistales or wjat?
<LordEnglish> eues ijourd- my attempted to write eyes closed witheyes closed
<texasboykc09> SuperBrony64, can you stream for a bit?
<Mr_Anybody> yes
<berberborscing> I can shoot lasers out of my eyes! Wait, what if I have to blink?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rex_Mundi: But he is, the most interesting pony, in the wurrrrld. *Cue exotic guitar*
<Mr_Anybody> you should
<Eddmario> So, still no stream?
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi, probably not a passionate romance type like Applejack and Rarity sounds like. Fluttershy and Rarity seem more like a close friendship at best. Like girl friends, not girlfriends.
<Ninjazz> but still "shipping" laws.
<Mr_Anybody> psst SuperBrony64 you should stream some of your mooness
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz: They are all ready good friends. No nead to 'friendship' them.
<FlutterDash31> s tur lifd str vlodrf - "my eye lids are closed" with my eye lds closed

<Haku1013> by, like, along time
<Karonia> Watch Topgear, play Minecraft, get pig.
<Haku1013> In my opinion, Final Wars is tied for the best Godzilla film
<Mr_Anybody> stepping on a dublo was like stepping on a goddamn spike trap
<Karonia> BRB
<Haku1013> Stepping on a Lego is like stepping on a rusty nail

<Mr_Anybody> legos? You mean my carpet?
<berberborscing> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> Haku1013: Lego's? Dont you mean, casual footwear?
<Darkfur> I always stepped on the one forgotten lego
<Haku1013> Spike Traps kill instantly, thus causing little to no suffering
<Haku1013> But the rusty nail will kill you slowly
<Haku1013> with infections and tetunus
<Haku1013> Causing maximum suffering
<berberborscing> tetANUS
<berberborscing> ?
<Haku1013> -_-
<Darkfur> google punji pit
<berberborscing> it xauses a tight anus.
<Mr_Anybody> stepping on that one lego coming out of the goddamn shower and slipping into the shower and hurting your rib, thigh, retina and jugular vain
<Haku1013> -_(\
<Haku1013> ouch
<Mr_Anybody> it was an interesting story at the doctors
<Haku1013> lol
<KrazyNoobs> I hate it when after a thunderstorm at 1am, it stop raining, you think you can finally go to sleep now, 30 seconds later, loudest thunder you've ever heard.
<Buytoast> why the hell do you have legos in your bathroom
<Mr_Anybody> shit man
<DoctoDoctorWho> I love rainstorms
<Mr_Anybody> legos are like the plauge, they are fucking everywhere
<DoctoDoctorWho> so calming
<Haku1013> Bitch please, I can sleep through the end of the world (Something I actually tried on the 21st)

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Batman esentally proves you can kick ass with out powers
<kono> YEEEEEEEESSS
<kono> have you read kingdom come?
<Haku1013> Please, Batman needs TIME to beat the tough guys
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I forgot when but I'm pretty sure Batman killed Darksied temporallily
<Haku1013> All of BM greatest feats are due to weeks or months of planning
<Haku1013> WITH HELP
<Haku1013> Batman got help
<DoctoDoctorWho> Haku1013: Exactly, it is a proven fact that batman can beat anyone with enough prep time
<Haku1013> So no, He's not the best hero then
<LordEnglish> Hulk could defeat superman...
<Haku1013> The best and most competent hero is the one who can get things done WHEN THEY HAPPEN
<FilliesandColtsfan> I cant get over baby Applejack
<kono> superman was able to reunite the JUS, put a bunch of renegade superheroes and villains in a prison, and survived a nuclear bomb able to kill SO MANY heroes
<Haku1013> LordEnglish dude, no need to speak the obvious
<kono> LORD ENGLISH KILLED HUSSIE
<DoctoDoctorWho> LordEnglish: Hulk is an auto win on anything, of course he does.
<Sparklerific> Hulk vs destroyer of worlds
<kono> wait
<Haku1013> The BEST DC heroes are Superman, Martian Manhunter, and Flash
<kono> Hulk, verses equestria
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Flash Gordon
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> hulk IS destroyer of worlds
<LordEnglish> I just pointed it out because of how Doomsday killed him and was a knock off of Hulk
<kono> he becomes so happy he turns into bruce banner
<Haku1013> Hulk actually kills EVERYTHING in the universe in one comic
<kono> and teh ponies kill them
<Sparklerific> how long would it take hulk to destroy earth
<kono> him*
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sparklerific: 10
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Without Banner the Hulk is a unstopable killing machine
<Sparklerific> 10 hours?
<Mr_Anybody> I need my daily dose of Lag B Gone
<Sparklerific> 10 days?
<Haku1013> Goku vs Superman
<Haku1013> GO
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sparklerific: 9
<kono> DEATH BATTLE
<Sparklerific> k?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Banner is pretty much the only thing keeping the Hulk from wrecking everything
<LordEnglish> Not true the Hulk outlived Banner and was quite peaceful
<kono> NO GUYS
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sparklerific: 8
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sparklerific: 7
<Haku1013> ^
<Sparklerific> seconds?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sparklerific: 6
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> 42
<Mr_Anybody> Goku used KamiyameKyropto It's super effective
<Haku1013> In Planet Hulk, Hulk atually lives a happy life and ends up getting a son

<Asouva> Oh, off the air :-(
<Sparklerific> Hulk vs Celestia
<Mr_Anybody> Is that the DOCTOR? EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE!!!!!!!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Row row fight the powa?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sparklerific: Please Celestia would lose easily
<LordEnglish> No one can defeat Celestia
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia cant do shit without Twight and co.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> *Twilight
<Mr_Anybody> what is that a company?
<Mr_Anybody> Twight and co.
<kono> Celestia: well Ill just send him to the moon
<berberborscing> Twight Howard.
<Mr_Anybody> what would they make?
<kono> Hulk on moon: SMASH
<LordEnglish> Okay only Twilight could defeat Celestia, but no one else
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Celly vs hulk, telekinesis is a bitch aint it?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Everytime some evil force showed up, Celestia lost easily
<kono> Celestia: shit, moons hurling towards equestria
<Haku1013> kono Too bad the Hulk will end up using THE MOON AS A WEAPON
<Sparklerific> Surely the Elements of Harmony are strong enough to turn Hulk into stone
<kono> exactly
<berberborscing> Celestia is this generation's Princess Peach.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> She always uses Twilight as her lackey
<Haku1013> Why would they turn him to stone?
<kono> celestia is the 9/11 of omnipotent beings
<Haku1013> As Hulk says, "NO ONE CAN CONTROL HULK. HULK IS STRONGEST"
<Mr_Anybody> I'm thirsty, someone geet me a latteee
<Sparklerific> goo point, it should just turn him into bruce banner again
<berberborscing> Never said HULK NEVER LEARNED GRAMMAR
<Haku1013> kono I get it :)
<Sparklerific> or possible rid him of the hulk forvever
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Personally, if some evil force was threatening my kingdom, I WOULD DO SOMETHING not send my subjects to do the work for me
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia is worst ruler
<texasboykc09> ^
<Haku1013> Luna is best ruler, and we never see her doing anything
<texasboykc09> ^
<Mr_Anybody> but best dictator
<berberborscing> Princess Peach doesn't get a new army after being kidnapped by Bowser 8 times
<kono> what luna has done
<DoctoDoctorWho> NMM: Taken by surprise Discord: Omnipotent, duh Chrysalis: Supercharged on love
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Well because Luna doesnt pull shit like celestia
<Haku1013> Princess Peach actually KNOWS how to fight
<Mr_Anybody> Celestia is worst ruler, but best dictator
<kono> regained rank as royalty
<kono> in 1 day
<LordEnglish> I saw this theory that the only reason Chrysalis over powered her was that everyone would have been vaporized by the power of the sun had Celestia not taken a h bombs level of her own power to the face.
<kono> earned trust of ponyville
<kono> in 1 day
<Haku1013> well, Haku's off
<Haku1013> night yall
<kono> goodnight
<Mr_Anybody> warned twilight about night time
<berberborscing> Cartoon physics save the day though.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What has Celestia done? Send 6 mortal ponies ot move a possibly violent dragon
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHICH ARE IMMUNE TO MAGIC
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sent Luna to ponyville and not inform her of what has changed
<LordEnglish> Trollestia at her finest
<kono> GUYS I HAZ MATCHUP
<kono> hulk vs TTGL vs Lord English
<berberborscing> Lord English wins.
<Sparklerific> Elements of Harmony are meant to rid Chaos, Evil, and all things bad. Therefore it should cure bruce banner from the Hulk like Luna from nightmare moon
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Luna may not do much but at least Luna is a total asshole
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: She knew they'd be fine, or else they wouldn't have been sent
<LordEnglish> Because I'm already here
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DoctoDoctorWho: THE POINT STANDS
<Deadlypon3> Guys
<kono> ?
<twilight_sprinkle> lol http://czudakx.deviantart.com/art/Ponyclopaedia-335461474
<Deadlypon3> The 'FBI' Locked my computer remotly :p
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Not to mention Celestia shot down Twilight at the wedding and never said sorry
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Bitch
<Deadlypon3> Saying I need to pay a fine in the next 72 hours or else I will be charged...
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: are you using someone elses computer?
<Deadlypon3> Twilight_sprinkle It's mine
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: i thought it was locked
<Deadlypon3> And I swear, I haven't looked at any of that
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: The point stands that she has damn near flawlessly run an empire for a millenium and all people can do is bitch
<Deadlypon3> I am using my laptop right now ^^'
<berberborscing> She's been holding a grudge from when Fluttershy "stole" her pet Phoenix I guess.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im seriously ranking the whole wedding fiasco as Celestia's worst moment
<Sparklerific> soo.... spike on AJ action?
<Mr_Anybody> wut did you do this time Deadlypon3
<Deadlypon3> Twilight_sprinkle the worst I have looked at was Doujjin...
<kono> gandalf vs Princess Celestia
<Deadlypon3> Mr_anybody I didn't hit anybody with my car this time :'(
<berberborscing> lawl hobbit reference
<richfiles> Celestia banishing her sister probably ranks worse... That couldn't have felt good
<Mr_Anybody> you didn't hit me
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Raise Twilight for years like a mother, DOUBT HER IMMIDEATLY
<Deadlypon3> My step mother told me it was just someone fucking with me...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> richfiles: Well that was nessicary
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The other times is sheer dickery
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: how is it locked, what does it say
<Deadlypon3> I thought so, since they said they can clear it all up by me paying a fine :p
<richfiles> Necessary don't make it better.
<kono> deadlypon3: plottwist, its your stepmother
<Sparklerific> maybe she banished her cuz she didnt have the strength to cure her
<Mr_Anybody> sure, ALWAYS listen to your step mother *end sarcasm*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> >Have 5 friends, send 2 tickets
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What
<texasboykc09> ^
<Deadlypon3> Twilight_sprinkle It says 'FBI has locked your computer' with the seal and all...to pay, use pay pal
<Ninjazz> She didn't meet her friends.
<berberborscing> If the world was ending, you'd know because all the McDonalds in North America would be closed down.
<richfiles> And that had to have nearly destroyed her on the inside...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ninjazz: YES SHE DID
<Ninjazz> And how was she supposed to know they wanted to go?
<Ninjazz> And this happened where?
<Deadlypon3> Kono OH PLOt twist...probably to teach me a lesson not to look at porn or Doujinn
<Ninjazz> We're watching this from Twilight's perspective.
<Deadlypon3> Ninjazz At the CHILDS ORPHANGE :O...
<Deadlypon3> And sorry, it's just...
<DoctoDoctorWho> Everyone always whines, "Sister wants more attention? banish her to the moon!" Well did anypony think of it this way? "Want more attention? Take over the world!"
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ninjazz: I dont know...WHEN LUNA WAS CURED
<LordEnglish> The profecy of her return was of twilight and her friends freeing her from the prison of nightmare moon
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: cant be legit, but ive never heard of that kind of hack in any case
<Ninjazz> Far be it for us to judge Celestia for not knowing every detail.
<kono> plottwist she is reading a doujin herself
<Ninjazz> SpadeKyurem[WoW], she didn't meet them.
<Mr_Anybody> The FBI found your P0rn folder Deadlypon3
<Deadlypon3> Twilight_sprinkle even then, Why not just knock on my door?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> They were right in front of her dummy
<Deadlypon3> If I really am doing that, they would just come and arrest me, not make me pay a FINE
<Sparklerific> Now your just somepony that I used to know!
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: because it isnt legit
<Ninjazz> And that proves?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And how the hell does celestia not know what a parasprite is
<Ninjazz> You're being judgemental.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> She's been around for how long?
<Deadlypon3> Twilight_sprinkle yeah...now I got to erease my computer to get rid of the trojan
<richfiles> If the FBI finds my pron folder, they'd just think I worked in equine husbandry! :$ :D
<kono> deadlypon3, say goodbye to your nekomimi and tsundere shit
<Deadlypon3> richfiles Yeaah
<Deadlypon3> I don't have a porn file
<kono> equius is that you?
<Deadlypon3> I look in browsers :p
<Mr_Anybody> NO.jpg richfiles
<richfiles> They'd think I was REALLY BAD at it... Mares don't do that! :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ninjazz: She sent Twilight to make friends to acess the elements so THERE IS NO EXCUSE
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: i dont think you need to erase it, just scan with a good antivirus
<Deadlypon3> But I am going through all my computer stuff and cleaning it all
<Sparklerific> Spadekyurem She knew, she was just trolling
<LordEnglish> Lovebug have not been around long and there a pest sometimes bugs just appear
<Deadlypon3> Twilight_sprinkle It's 'locked' so no dice
<kono> :33< equius how are you this purrfect day?
<Ninjazz> SpadeKyurem[WoW], she sent them for Spike and Twilight alone. Is there a problem with that?
<Mr_Anybody> well if you are areested and brought into questioning, don't mention us
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: also the first letters in my name arent capitalized, start typing my name and then press tab to autocomplete
<LordEnglish> D--> e%cellent
<Deadlypon3> The worst part is explaining to my step mom why I was going around sites that might make me panic about 'pedophilia' or beastiliaty
<Ninjazz> And maybe Twilight could have just asked Celestia for 4 more tickets herself.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Everyone always blames celestia for not helping ponyville, have you seen canterlot? Its like, 80 miles away!
<Ninjazz> That could have solved things quicker, hmm?
<Ninjazz> But noooo.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DoctoDoctorWho: TELEPORTATION
<Ninjazz> it's Celestia's fault.
<sgt_brony> why does it say only 4:40 tiil the new episode???
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: look up something on the internet on how to unlock it, or ask some computer techies we got here like Phase4
<kono> :33< Your dancestor gave me the creeps...
<Mr_Anybody> ponies man, they make the FBI lock your computer
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: actually if thats windows he might not know, but you can also ask Shizuka
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkle I'm sure my step mom will figure it out, she knows already.
<Phase4> 00,02?
<LordEnglish> D--> his smile is quite 100d
<Deadlypon3> Phase4 we are just discussing porn, go back to sleep :p
<Sparklerific> 20% of the intornets is filled with poneez
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: Deadlypon3 said he had his computer hacked and locked
<Deadlypon3> Still shaking.
<Phase4> 00,02but i'm not tired :)
<Phase4> 00,02i meen :(
<Deadlypon3> I am really shaking stll
<Phase4> 00,02silly () being next to each other
<Deadlypon3> Thought I would be labeled as a sex offender...
<kono> sparklefic, but its still 100% filled with Bullshit
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: but he says he'll figure it out, so i guess the ping was unnecessary, sorry
<Deadlypon3> ...AND WHO IS THAT HIP DUDE WITH THE STYLES
<berberborscing> Vegetarians dont exist in the world of ponies... because that's everyone!
<Mr_Anybody> Deadlypon3: relax man, you just need to calm down, and look at pictures of ponies aight
<Deadlypon3> twilight_sprinkl ever had this happen to you
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I still dont see how Celestia barely put up a fight when Nightmare Moon returned, you would think she would at least try to fight back
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Doesnt matter, if you were ruler, and you knew that the best mage in the kingdom lived in that town, who also happened to be the chosen one, along with her 5 friends who are formidable in their own rights, would you not trust them to be able to take care of the weekly crisis?
<Deadlypon3> ...I'm scared cause I think it might get me arrested :(
<kono> berb what about timberwolves?
<twilight_sprinkle> no Deadlypon3 like i said, ive never heard of such things
<Phase4> 00,02Deadlypon3, oh, you got your computer infected with something
<LordEnglish> D--> though i STRONGLY agree with his choice of statuary
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: and no, im sure its not the actual fbi, tehy wouldnt ask you to pay over paypal
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DoctoDoctorWho: Still screams lazy to me, to not handle problems of your kingdom yourself and not send the help
<Mr_Anybody> hey is SuperBrony64 still mooing around here?
<Deadlypon3> Phase4 yeah...for a brief minute or two, I actually thought the FBI is charging me with pedophilia
<berberborscing> Timberwolves are carnivores.
<Phase4> 00,02Deadlypon3, try reboot in safe mode
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And dragons are immune to magic so the whole dragon issue was stupid
<richfiles> Imma go to bed now. :) I have a definite hope that Luna might invade my dreams!... Last night All I got was a zombie Star trek dream on a spacestation... It was all a prank, but the actual startrek cast was there by chance... The runnnig joke was there can only be one kirk, one spock, etc... And the whole prank had hoards of spock and kirk and other trek characters done as zombies... It has HILARIOUS... But no ponies...
<Phase4> 00,02most trojans like that don't bother finding exploits these days
<Deadlypon3> It's 12:50 in the night
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: you might be able to try and checking the paypal number they sent you, altho idk how paypal works
<Deadlypon3> Phase4 My step mother is going to work on it in the morning
<kono> :33< The cunning feline pounces on her pray, the strong yet elegant creature is stunned
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Twilights magic aint gonna do shit to a giantic possibly violent dragon
<Phase4> 00,02Deadlypon3, whats that in 24 hour time?
<Sparklerific> berberorscing or pony rapists
<Mr_Anybody> those text walls disable my auto scroll D:<
<Deadlypon3> 00:50
<Phase4> 00,02i hate when people quote 12 in 12 hour time
<Phase4> 00,02it's confusing and bad
<Deadlypon3> Phase4 sorry :p
<berberborscing> Phase4 is best pony.

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: /)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Deadlypon3: D:

<aniderp|bestcakeever> is the loto today?
<LordEnglish> Danm I don't rp eq well enough to really know how to reply -_-'
<Northern_Charge> yeah i got that too. it locked down my PC :T
<kono> lordenglish, try roleplaying as the opposite gender...
<Sparklerific> rename the 7 stages of guilt with the 7 stages of Derpy
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: She has a kingdom to run if you havent noticed
<berberborscing> Hey Princess Celestia, get your lazy ass off that porn and do all those jobs yourself
<kono> that is kinda awkward...
<Deadlypon3> Northern_charge I actually did thought it was the FBI at first for a few minutes
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DoctoDoctorWho: Right...and she does that so welll...not
<Mr_Anybody> we need a stream going
<Sparklerific> stage 1: I just don't know what went wrong
<LordEnglish> I'm not sur how that will help???

*aniderp|bestcakeever climbs onto SuperBrony64 head
<kono> What if...princess celestia spends her entire days watching my little hoofbeast: moraillegince is magic
<Ninjazz> SpadeKyurem[WoW], I think you have the problem where you think Celestia is supposed to be a perfect being. She has flaws, as you obviously are aware, but keep rejecting that she has good sides too.
<Deadlypon3> Northern_Charge But mah moneiz and the deals
<Sparklerific> Stage 3: say your sorry... while "trying" to mess things up further
<Northern_Charge> steams online so it will remember it
<Deadlypon3> Sparklerific Stop quoting my stages when my computer is ruined by virus
<Sparklerific> sorry, tryig noy
*Mr_Anybody gets on SuperBrony64 back

<DoctoDoctorWho> silly SuperBrony64, your supposed to use "" when talking
<kono> guys*
<Ninjazz> SpadeKyurem[WoW], says who? We are watching from Twilight's perspective ALL the time. Infact, she was sending Twilight her own friendship reports to help in some way. That itself shows that she's doing things off screen. Why are you judging her on whether or not she's on screen doing something.
<Northern_Charge> yeah i wasnt happy about what happend either XD but i think of it this way. at least i dont have to clean all the junk off my PC now.
<Mr_Anybody> SuperBrony64: yo super you should give me your gmail so I can stalk you :3
<Sparklerific> stage....4 I believe
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ninjazz: Well lets see...she sends twilight after the elements and thats all she does
<DoctoDoctorWho> Deadlypon3: Pillz nawt gud, y u take pillz?
<Ninjazz> She sent her to Ponyville to make friends.
<Sparklerific> Stage 4: give your friend a derpy smile :P
<NocturnalBlade> Goodnight guys, gonna go get a little sleep before the episode, see yall in a few hours ^_^
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/12/window-to-equestria-3d-ponies-everywhere.html
<berberborscing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWfToMXA43c Did this battle a little while ago, it's a shitton harder than it looks.
<Deadlypon3> DoctoDoctorWho They are offically prescribed...forgot to take them today
<Sparklerific> Stage 5: Feel sad because people think your offensive
<Deadlypon3> The government is getting so debt-ridden that the FBI is asking sex offenders to pay to avoid getting registered :p
<Deadlypon3> OOPS
<Mr_Anybody> twilight_sprinkle: this is the portal to equestria!! :D
<Deadlypon3> ...That sounds like an onion headline
<Sparklerific> Stage 6: Feel better knowing millions out there still love and apreciate who u are
<Mr_Anybody> you found it
<Deadlypon3> Sparklerific Stop making me feel happy :'(!
<berberborscing> That damn boss was very hard, kills you at level 36 in just two hits
<DoctoDoctorWho> Deadlypon3: I feel for you man, hope all that clears someday :P
<texasboykc09> someone ping me
<twilight_sprinkle> Deadlypon3: did you try googling this thing
<Phase4> 00,02SpadeKyurem[WoW], (
<Phase4> 00,02i meen (\
<twilight_sprinkle> )
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRn6jDa4Oyw&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
<Deadlypon3> I don't want to right now...
<Phase4> 00,02derp
<Sparklerific> And finally Stage 7: BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE BY BEING...:P
<twilight_sprinkle> i closed that parenthesis for you Phase4, now you wont get a chat compilation error!
<Deadlypon3> DERPEH
<Deadlypon3> ...I am now going to play Persona 4 Golden while listening to Talkradar :O!
<berberborscing> What's also horrible
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I'm not trying to imply that Celestia needs to be perfect but she could take some time out of her day to get off her flank and so something to help instead of letting her lackey Twilight and friends to do it for her
<DoctoDoctorWho> Celestia is an awesome ruler, everypony just cant appreciate the crap she does for equestria.
<Mr_Anybody> NEEDA STREAM HERE!
<berberborscing> This boss has INFINITE health until you are able to perform Data Drain.
<Deadlypon3> ...Speaking of INFINITE.
<DashWithRainbows> A streamer will stream when they feel like doing so, Mr_Anybody.
<Deadlypon3> Anyone seen the new Bioshock Infinite Trailer :)?
<Sparklerific> anyways that was the 7 stages of derpy I just made up. I guess that sounded beautiful, huh?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh theres some evil theatening my kingdom? Better get Twilight to handle it for me!
<Deadlypon3> Sparklerfic I suppose
<Mr_Anybody> ok my stomach is hurting so I'm going to bed
<RawketLawnchair> R-r-r-r-rattle me bones.
<Deadlypon3> Mr_anybody baaai
<Mr_Anybody> gngiht streamies
<twilight_sprinkle> Mr_Anybody: gnight, hope your stomach gets better
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: So what was that when twi was having a magical meltdown? She walked up, PUT A HOOF ON HER SHOULDER, and stopped it.
<DoctoDoctorWho> no problem
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And for you saying she might be doing something off screen is bull, theres no implication she ever does anything
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So for all we know she's doing jack all
<Ninjazz> And there's no implication that she wasn't doing anything as well. You're just ranting.
<Deadlypon3> Hey Everypony! Where is this reference from:
<Deadlypon3> B-B-B-BlOODY SCREEN! -SO REAL!-
<Seeker> so what's going on?
<AppleCrisp> Im back.....i cant sleep
<Deadlypon3> Anypony get the reference?
<berberborscing> no
<Deadlypon3> ...It's Duty Calls
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRn6jDa4Oyw&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
<DoctoDoctorWho> Seeker: We are defending celestias honour young paladin of the sun!
<Deadlypon3> The trailer/game from the people who made BulletStorm :p
<twilight_sprinkle> http://fongsaunder.deviantart.com/art/Dreamwalker-344696179
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Really....prove me 3 things celestia has done that was helpful that didnt require Twilight doing all the work
<KrazyNoobs> I'm back.
<texasboykc09> wb KrazyNoobs
<Life_Essence> posting memes...that's a paddlin'
<AppleCrisp> Celestia Raises the sun
<tackeart> oh hey, the stream is actually working for once.
<AppleCrisp> can Twi do that>
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Unfucking ponyville from twilights own want it need it spell
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Thats once
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And the sun doesnt count
<Deadlypon3> I gotta go...the FBI is charging in with guns blazing for me looking at a picture of derpy with socks on :)
<Ninjazz> Actually yes it does.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Yes the sun counts
<twilight_sprinkle> AppleCrisp: no but she can raise the moon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KafNXjIh4MU
<tackeart> Deadlypon3: I know, the fuzz is getting stricter and stricter.
<Northern_Charge> D:
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> No it doesnt thats pretty much her damn job...she still doesnt do anything to help when evil invades
<Deadlypon3> tackeart even just staring at these pictures flying past is enough to get us all the death setence :P
<texasboykc09> bye everypony again
<tackeart> tackeart: that's why i live in canada.
<tackeart> ..wat
<tackeart> Deadlypon3: that's why i live in canada.
<tackeart> 0_o
<Ninjazz> Oh really. So you mean doing her job doesn't count. So by that logic, Twilight doing what Celestia told her to do doesn't count at all then. Cause that's what she's supposed to do because that's Twilight's job as her student.
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the changling invasion, she lost but she still got up to help
<Deadlypon3> tackeart ...THEN YOU SHALL BE THE LAST TO SEE AMERICAS FREEDOM FALL!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> DoctoDoctorWho: And that did what exactly?
<Deadlypon3> *Dragged off* AVENGE ME!!!
<Deadlypon3> AVEEENGE MEEEEE!
<berberborscing> THIS is how you build up a final boss in a first installment, make sure he never talks, show him killing (or coma-ing in this case) a mentor type character right from﻿ the start, give little mention of him outside of the player character's mentioning, thus building him up as being some force of nature (or otherwise) rather then a character, then after the PC finally kills him somehow, show that he was a just a soldier answering to a higher p
<tackeart> Deadlypon3: See ya!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Got her ass kicked
<CrystalPhoenix> I really cannot adore this picture enough http://fav.me/d5pbe45
<Deadlypon3> ...*Gunshot*
<CrystalPhoenix> and yes I really love her mane
<CrystalPhoenix> a lot
<Ninjazz> Pointless. You're just ranting.
<Deadlypon3> ...So yeah, I will see you ponies later
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Right like you can defend her being oh so helpful
<tackeart> ..I just realized Sombra is the villain that got the closest to actually injuring the Mane Six.
<berberborscing> Man, just wait till the season 3 finale...
<AppleCrisp> Wish Sombra had a bigger part
<Life_Essence> Discord didn't want to injure them
<Ninjazz> CrystalPhoenix, I have no words.
<fleskywood> guys
<berberborscing> No one simply owns words.
<tackeart> Berberborscing: They only had 13 episodes, so they had to pack all the awesomeness into them.
<fleskywood> all posts landing on atime that ends in 0 are true facts
<CrystalPhoenix> I really love a look into the future MLP pictures
<Ninjazz> ^
<berberborscing> Ill show you every picture of the next episode.
<berberborscing> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: The want it need it spell, raising the sun every day, and basicly saving equestria from every major threat ever 1000 years ago.
<Ninjazz> Especially involving the CMC.
<berberborscing> wth did luna do to be banished for 1000 years?
<tackeart> Five bucks the CMC never get their cutie marks this season.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia is about as useful as a sack of bricks when she isnt raising the sun
<tackeart> ^
<CrystalPhoenix> Ninjazz, one major reason I love Slice of life Ponies
<tackeart> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> berberborscing: Try to take over and kill everyone
<AppleCrisp> Celestia is there to troll man
<tackeart> PLEASE NOTE: The first and last two episodes of every season are where things get serious. The rest is the general shenanigans of the Mane Crew.
<AppleCrisp> she is very usfull
<berberborscing> lol.
<berberborscing> very true
<Ninjazz> CrystalPhoenix, same.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Luna complained ponies didint apreciate her night, even though most ponies were probably fucking asleep
<berberborscing> Not us...
<AppleCrisp> I sleep when the sun comes up
<tackeart> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: I don't think Luna understood pony sleep cycles and the natural instinct of ponies to fear the night's many predators.
<KrazyNoobs3> ...
<AppleCrisp> Fluttershy awakens at night
<tackeart> ponies ARE natural prey animals, ya know.
<RawketLawnchair> Fluttershy is a crummy pony.
<berberborscing> So, I made a comic at my school. My school is mostly anti-brony.
<berberborscing> So I made it almost the same as MLP but with ants.
<AppleCrisp> lets not open this window, please
<DoctoDoctorWho> RawketLawnchair: :O how could you!?
<berberborscing> And they loved it.
<RawketLawnchair> DoctoDoctorWho: Truth hurts.
<sub06905> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cSzICMc_bw
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> tackeart: Ya see to me that makes me think Nightmare Moon happened due to a hissy fit essentally
<sub06905> :P
<tackeart> @doctoDoctorWho Unleash the ninja rabbits!
<RawketLawnchair> Luna's the worst, so is Fluttershy.
<fleskywood> no
<fleskywood> luna is best princess
<RawketLawnchair> Nope.
<sub06905> sea ponies are best ponies
<AppleCrisp> There all the best
<fleskywood> trixie is the wors
<tackeart> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Either that, or she wanted to make the night look fancier, and there was a curse on the book to make the eternal night spell look like 'etheral night'
<fleskywood> worst*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also how does one rule over anything with no sunlight
<tackeart> I may have taken that from a fanfic somewhere, yes.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You need sunlight to grow food
<twilight_sprinkle> RawketLawnchair: agreed about fs, but i do like luna
<DoctoDoctorWho> DoctoDoctorWho: Aside from iron will and discord, when did she ever do anything wrong
<RawketLawnchair> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Live in the caves. Biolumineces and stuff.
<RawketLawnchair> Do you even dorf?
<sub06905> lel
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You cant rule over dead ponies
<DoctoDoctorWho> Wait, RawketLawnchair be trollin
<RawketLawnchair> DoctoDoctorWho: Nah. It's the truth.
<tackeart> RawketLawnchair: +1 for dorf fortress reference
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ah Dwarf Fortress where losing is fun!
<berberborscing> Luna has more power than Celestia if you think about it.
<tackeart> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> yup, he be trollin
<RawketLawnchair> lol2cat and such.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The best thing about DF is seeing how badly it ends
<DoctoDoctorWho> berberborscing: here we go...
<tackeart> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: I think there's a pony version of DF.
<pony3252456> :)
<RawketLawnchair> berberborscing: No.
<twilight_sprinkle> berberborscing: but celestia banished her
<tackeart> So anyway, I'm off to try out the UDK.
<tackeart> Bai!
<fleskywood> berberborscing: how?
<twilight_sprinkle> bye tackeart
<tackeart> see y'all tomorrow
<berberborscing> Luna raises all the stars that are all suns that could be larger than the one sun Celestia controls
<fleskywood> berberborscing: how?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Can I ask what can exactly thrive in terms of food in eternal night?
<RawketLawnchair> berberborscing: Luna raises the moon, you dope.
<berberborscing> And the stars.
<Shizuka> 13just put down torches
<AppleCrisp> Good point
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dont think Luna thought out the whole eternal night out so well
<RawketLawnchair> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Magic crops.
<Shizuka> 13wheat will grow fine
<fleskywood> underlining isn't coloring
<RawketLawnchair> Luna doesn't do anything with the stars, she just raises the moon, ya doof.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im also so eternal night would allow predators to run rampant
<fleskywood> doofhamd
<AppleCrisp> she raises the stars too
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So...yea
<fleskywood> doofhand*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> *sure
<berberborscing> In one clip: Luna says " I have to raise all the stars too?" and Celestia says "You know, I'll raise the stars one night for you
<DoctoDoctorWho> berberborscing: Luna controlls the moon and has a degree of atmospheric controll, allowing her to controll light patterns in the night sky allowing her to "Change" the nights appearance, that is all.
<berberborscing> How do you know this?
<twilight_sprinkle> berberborscing: thats fanon though
<RawketLawnchair> berberborscing: Show me the clip.
<AusPony> the stars are visable after celestia lowers the sun
<Asouva> LOL
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im going to assume since Luna can transform, Im going to assume Celestia can do the same
<AppleCrisp> I have one question....where was spike in the canterlot weddding???
<RawketLawnchair> AppleCrisp: Sleeping.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Playing with the wedding toppers
<berberborscing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkpRUhdVNmU
<RawketLawnchair> >Implying thats canon
<RawketLawnchair> Nah.
<DoctoDoctorWho> berberborscing: Your star theory has no more proof than mine, so mine, being more feasable, becomes the norm by default
<Shizuka> 13uh no
<Shizuka> 13occam's razor
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Luna still has more power than Celestia, she can fucking control dreams
<Ninjazz> yfw they gon make Twilight move the stars. CONSPIRACY.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia cant do that shit
<Shizuka> 13equestria exists in a skydome
<Shizuka> 13the two princesses rotate the dome
<DoctoDoctorWho> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> twilight will be the new absolute supreme empress
<RawketLawnchair> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: She can't. She just visits.
<Shizuka> 13it's not that one raises the sun and one raises the moon, they just take turns moving the dome
<AppleCrisp> OMG thats true luna can go in dreams
<RawketLawnchair> Do you even watch the show.
<Shizuka> 13thus why celestia did th job alone for so long
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What if the princesses dont control the sun and moon at all and they just say they do? *insert consperacy reeves here
<pony_809> sorry i just got here will the stream be picking up soon or only in the real morningbhours?
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: and the worst that does is nightmares, still not as scary as a goddess throwing sunbolts at you
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Shizuka: Nah she just sets the time command to what ever she feels like :P
<Shizuka> 13/time set day
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Celestia and Luna playing minecraft would be hilarious
<twilight_sprinkle> celestia and luna are simply scootaloo's pawns, she is the true ruler of the u\world
<twilight_sprinkle> *world
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Please just stop hating on celestia, she has done nothing to deserve it.
<AppleCrisp> Scootaloo huh, i can live with that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> No I think she has enough for me to warrent hate

<AppleCrisp> Man i want the french flim anf flam back
<KrazyNoobs> Hi everypony im back
<AppleCrisp> and*
<KrazyNoobs> arguments?

<Overload> Was... That asuka? Holding a pony?
<BlitzMcKrieg> does anyone know when it starts?
<AppleCrisp> Hi Krazy
<MasterSonic10> Can someone tell me the reason for different theatres? I don't get it
<KrazyNoobs> I wonder when the episode starts.
<KrazyNoobs> ...
<MasterSonic10> No wait a sec
<BlitzMcKrieg> I think its because of so many people, they dont want cluttered chatrooms
<Shrimp> MasterSonic10: Each theatre has a different chat room during the episode
<MasterSonic10> oh ok
<MasterSonic10> Thanks! :)
<Forte> to handle more people and have people actually able to chat
<MasterSonic10> lol yeah :D
<berberborscing> This is a normal video until the 5th second. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keu1voAmcmY
<Forte> other wise too much is said too fast and the stream crashes because too many are on
<BlitzMcKrieg> but thats always so much fun!
<KrazyNoobs3> If you like immaturity and trolls, go to Rainbow Dash Room, if you just want to watch the stream and chat with other bronies without spoilers, go to other rooms.
<BlitzMcKrieg> So... this is the fun room?
<Shrimp> Yes
<BlitzMcKrieg> sweet
<MasterSonic10> lol that video

<AdamTheDuck> o.o Main?
<AppleCrisp> my little pony my little pony ah ah ah ah
<pony_4190> Bronies! Let's start this! Show this petty hater who's the toughest!
<Ninjazz> It doesn't surprise me anymore, Buytoast.
<MasterSonic10> Who?
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Uboa-San> https://boards.4chan.org/b/res/447012132 Again, on /b/
<Buytoast> some dumbass made a thread on /v/ pretending to be a le epic hacker and told mane that one of the hackers made it and shit
<pony_4190> The biggest mistake that they've ever made!
<Buytoast> i mean come on
<pony64> yes lets show them who's boss
<Buytoast> how can people be so stupid?
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome to the internet
<AdamTheDuck> I will be your guide
<MasterSonic10> No who are we showing who's toughest?
<Ninjazz> They dun't lurk enough.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You guys do know this makes us no better than them right?
<Ninjazz> No srsly.
<berberborscing> lol
<pony_4190> The haters!
<pony_4190> The HACKERS>
<Ninjazz> You learn the answers to everything if you just lurk.
<Buytoast> Uboa-San, we're all so impressed you can make threads on 4-chan
<MasterSonic10> oh right... LET'S GET THEM!!!!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I suggest we ignore them
<Buytoast> but it's getting annoying
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, that's what I pretty much did when I first came here
<Knuckleshy> Spade does have a point.
<MasterSonic10> yeah
<AdamTheDuck> was too shy to talk anyway :P
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Acting like this makes us no better than them
<Buytoast> that's what you're pretty much supposed to do
<BlitzMcKrieg> so... we're pretty much inviting them now...
<Buytoast> you learn everything if you just let others ask and talk about it
<berberborscing> niggastolemyspacebar
<MasterSonic10> XD
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Doing this shit is essentally asking for it
<pony_4190> -_-
<Ninjazz> I skipped a step. I just made sure whatever I said wasn't stupid and held my opinion to myself.
<Alchemist> I dont know what the problem is. Even if they do it, the ep will be on youtube 1-2 hours after air time...
<Ninjazz> Not sure...how I did but eh.
<Asouva> It's out on iTunes already
<Asouva> The audio is a little messed up though
<BlitzMcKrieg> Yeah, but thats not the point
<Buytoast> i knew i should've gone to bed earlier today
<MasterSonic10> Oh by the way, This is my first time on this!
<pony_4190> They won't hack us... They're just bluffing.
<Ninjazz> It shows.
<MasterSonic10> SO now I get to react with other Bronies!
*berberborscing
<GrayHoof> I found a thread on /v/, they say they're going to raid bronystate(again).
<BlitzMcKrieg> lets not forget love and tolerance guys
<Buytoast> these people are going to give me an aneurysm
<Alchemist> oh now I see whats going on :D
<Knuckleshy> hmm?
<MasterSonic10> Wha?
<BlitzMcKrieg> ...
<Ninjazz> it's not even amusing anymore.
<pony_4190> Okay, Blitz. You're right.
<Alchemist> just the usual "fear" mongering, attention seeking etc. Nothing to worry about.
<pony_4190> And how often do people say that they are going to hack us?
<BlitzMcKrieg> usually
<DashWithRainbows> What I love the most is that you have not shown any proof of this claim, GrayHoof.
<TheRealShadman> I DRAW SO GOOD ON MY CINTIQ
<BlitzMcKrieg> Yeah, I cant find it
<pony_4190> https://boards.4chan.org/v/res/168989348
<GrayHoof> thank you.
<pony64> yes this is going good, so very good
<BlitzMcKrieg> oh... well, there it is
<pony_4190> But if they WERE Going to hack us, they wouldn't wait
<BlitzMcKrieg> I dont think they're going to
<BlitzMcKrieg> words are a lot easier than action
<pony_9941> ФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФ
<GrayHoof> They're going to attack when the stream starts.
<Buytoast> you know, i should be surprised at just how stupid you people sound and are acting right now
<berberborscing> I'm worried, this is one of my favorite websites...
<Buytoast> but it's the weekend
<Blix> who is attacking?
<berberborscing> Anonymous...
<pony_4190> They aren't Anonymous.
<BlitzMcKrieg> How are we stupid?
<Buytoast> nobody is attacking, Uboa-San just made a fake threat and you all are dancing like monkeys to an organ grinder
<GrayHoof> they are anonymous(technically)
<Uboa-San> I was just trolling /v/
<BlitzMcKrieg> Yeah, but we're all just having fun, I think.
<berberborscing> Oh, I just logged on and missed some and got worried
<BlitzMcKrieg> I mean, we're all bored here
<Alchemist> The same guy posted a weak attention seeking message on two boards and didnt receive much support as I can see. Like I said: attention whoring, nothing to worry about. (and I'd bet he/she is posting these here to get more attention :D )
<Uboa-San> Once the time has come, I will rustle those who fell for the troll, (Except bronies)
<BlitzMcKrieg> and yet, we give him the most attention of all
<pony64> this is fun lets see if they keep posting
<Buytoast> may be bored, but don't go shitting up /v/
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ignore them I say
<pony64> o god what if one of them is in the chat right now...
<pony64> aww ok
<berberborscing> They keep posting the same thing though "You cant stop us"
<BlitzMcKrieg> Indeed, I dont condone taunting anyone
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> This makes us no better than them you know
<berberborscing> Well Spade
<berberborscing> They said "Fuck Love and Tolerance"
<berberborscing> and now we mean shit.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> How many fucking bronies actually even follow that anymore
<BlitzMcKrieg> we just need to love and tolerate harder
<Buytoast> oh no, they don't like love and tolerance!
<Buytoast> it's the end of days!
<Buytoast> goddamn kid
<GrayHoof> .....nothing, OP didn't deliver.
<Buytoast> who gives a shit
<berberborscing> They sound no better than the 7th and 8th grade idiots at my middle school
<pony64> guys stop, there is a troll in our midst
<pony_4190> If they were going to hack us, they would have done it already
<Alchemist> !cd

<Buytoast> we know you're making them
<AppleCrisp> This is such a loving chat room
<Uboa-San> All troll attempts,
<GrayHoof> how can we know he's doing it?
<Buytoast> it's getting old
<BlitzMcKrieg> I hate you too
<GrayHoof> It's almost impossible to identify someone on 4chan.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im not saying he is or isnt but how do you suggest he's the one doing it?
<pony64> hwo do you keep posting them as they are made...
<pyrocatboy> Hello everypony.
<DONTE> fag
<Uboa-San> I deleted the leak thread
<pony64> how*
<Alchemist> AppleCrisp: it usually is, but it takes only one persistant jerk...
<BlitzMcKrieg> hello
<Knuckleshy> Hi pyro
<pony64> hello
<BlitzMcKrieg> we're in a strange mood right now, some of us are less than polite in here
<pony64> id say that too, even me
<DONTE> who wants to fuck some horses
<pony64> or, me too
<MasterSonic10> :D

<pyrocatboy> I just watched Every. Single. Episode of Baccano! in one sitting.
<pony64> buts its great
<Buytoast> and you see what happens?
<Uboa-San> Minutes before stream starts, I will delete the Thread to rustle jimmies of Anonymous,
<MasterSonic10> Played NFs Most Wanted
<pony64> baccano, what anime was that again
<pony64> ?
<Uboa-San> Not sure if will backfire or not
<berberborscing> Need For Speed over time evolved into Burnout...
<Buytoast> we get Donte the Demon Killer
<DONTE> NFS sucks
<DONTE> screw ea
<Knuckleshy> I still need to catch up with that anime Pryo
<AppleCrisp> apple fwitter

<pony64> YES
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So who are the idiots atagonizing 4chan?
<DONTE> u
<DashWithRainbows> I don't know, DONTE, some of the NFS games were alright.
<AskPeachy|MMF> I hate Omegle
<AskPeachy|MMF> XD
<berberborscing> NFS dropped in profit after carbon...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I suggest to ignore them and people go ahead and anger them
<Buytoast> only if you say you are SpadeKyurem[WoW]
<pony64> i think it might be "not-plural" as in one sad forchanner
<pyrocatboy> I kinda liked Carbon...
<DONTE> nfs sucked when they started the underground ricer scene
<berberborscing> Carbon was the last "good game" people thought
<Anonymous> .
<RawketLawnchair> Good games?
<Anonymous> LOL JK
<RawketLawnchair> Play They Bleed Pixels.
<Anonymous> It's not really Ananymous
<pony64> o god here we go :P
<Alchemist> My only problem with NFS games was it seemed that the AI is cheating many times.
<BlitzMcKrieg> they bleed pixels sounds awesome
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Well I was keeping tabs on the thread seeing how bad it went and the threat has apperently been killed
<pony64> thats good
<berberborscing> Beating some races were impossible even.
<Uboa-San> Banned from 4chan, But i can use proxy to troll more!
<Blix> Early youtube post of the episode is up is anyone wants the link
<pyrocatboy> Burnout: Revenge is best racing game.
<Alchemist> they get into a crash and 10 seconds later they are behind me again. Its annoying
<pony64> YES
<pony64> burnout
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Uboa-San: You know people like you is why people hate bronies
<pony64> revenge
<berberborscing> On my 13th try, I beat the Range Rover Evoque VS McLaren MP4-12C challenge
<pony1234> It's me! I Was the one who pretended to be Anonymous for a couplr seconds.
<Buytoast> you know, people like you are the reason people hate you guys for watching this stuff
<DashWithRainbows> Uboa you are a terrible "troll".
<DONTE> liar

<Uboa-San> Not bronies, the ones who are anonymous
<pyrocatboy> VOCAL MINORITY
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And then they assume every brony is fucking stupid
<DashWithRainbows> Rainbow_Dash_BEBBEH No one is streaming at the moment.
<berberborscing> Underground 1 was too hard.

<DashWithRainbows> It's not hard to point the blame at someone else.
<Jmo> It wasn't hacked by /v/ or the GNAA.
<berberborscing> I was so happy when I beat .hack//infection
<Jmo> It was hijacked by another stream, end of story.
<DONTE> fag
<pony64> .hack//infection? is that a game
<berberborscing> Yes
<Phase4> 00,02DONTE, o_O
<pony64> ive watched the show of hacksign
<DONTE> no its shit
<pony64> cool
<Uboa-San> Forget about that everything and continue
<berberborscing> I recommend getting it if you dont
<pony64> anyone here have played persona 4 or 3, those were great
<berberborscing> Its a great game for PS2
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Uboa-San: You juse seem content in starting a flame war and not caring about the reprocussions
<DONTE> no u
<pony64> i have xbox only, sadly./...
<DashWithRainbows> Best talk to Saxy when he's online, pony64.

<DashWithRainbows> He's into fighting games.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: Nope
<BlitzMcKrieg> im so distracted!
*pyrocatboy is distracted
<berberborscing> Almost the same as .hack//SIGN but with different characters, like Kite, BlackRose and Mia
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 used pretty colors... it's not very effective
<berberborscing> You'll recognize BlackRose
<berberborscing> And Elk looks like the main character
<BlitzMcKrieg> it works better on the "stupid" brony type
<BlitzMcKrieg> and then I said something else
<AppleCrisp> i was on chat for another good 45 mins time to find somthin ealse to do see yall later
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Thats the one major thing about this fandom that pisses me off
<pony64> wut?
<berberborscing> Everyone at my school plays Naruto Shippuden...
<pony64> derrrrp
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> We have fanatical morons who make the entire fandom look fucking stupid
<DONTE> my gt is xXThe_DemOn_KiLLaH_420Xx
<pony64> yea, but thats the same for all fandoms usually
<BlitzMcKrieg> every culture has them
<pony64> ^eeyup
<berberborscing> When I get an XBox, ill be sure to add you donte
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And then everyone hates us because some assholes cant be sensible
<pyrocatboy> Spade THats every fandom EVER!
<Uboa-San> OBJECTION! Case Closed!
<pony64> some of the "asswholes" migth just be actually trolls tho, just putting that out there
<DONTE> like you

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dont see why we cant just watch the show and everyone be fine with it
<BlitzMcKrieg> no u
<pony64> pheonix write is best inturrupting cow
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> We watch a show, who cares?

<DONTE> no hes dead
<BlitzMcKrieg> lol
<berberborscing> People need to give things at least a chance...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I still dont see any justified reason to hate the show other than you just dont like it
<berberborscing> Not just deny it and stay the same forever
<BlitzMcKrieg> well, we all did, didn't we? And now we're here
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If you dont like the show, not my problem, just leave the people who like it alone
<Uboa-San> If the troll plan doesnt backfire, It will be safe to watch your Episode
<BlitzMcKrieg> people dont like different... its in our nature
<pony64> maby they are scared we will take over like all of the US's or the wolrds culture or something
<Buytoast> you just saw the fallout of someone using horses to try and troll /v/ and you're wondering why people hate the show
<berberborscing> I saw the teens react to MLP, only one teen rated it AFTER seeing it.
<DONTE> 1 its sucks 2 its stupid and 3 i hate it
<pony64> actually that just sounded stupid i take that back
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Uboa-San: And if it does Fuck you asshole
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Uboa-San: You caused this so if shit goes down its your problem
<BlitzMcKrieg> wow, pony64... got some plans there?

<Uboa-San> Sorry for what i did, Some brony hater brought me unconscious and started all this craze,
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that's -b

<MasterSonic10> Why JRP2234???
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If they dont like the show for a good reason, so be it.
<pony64> and thats how we do it down here on th'farm

<berberborscing> Ponies are just like that!
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 y u no listen to my stupid silly questions?

<Ninjazz> Actually, here's hoping DWR smacks some sense into chat.
<JRP2234> that ban spam
<pyrocatboy> Would Far Cry 3 be considered as evidence for a drug case?

<pony64> i think i have
<BlitzMcKrieg> of course we have
<MasterSonic10> I became a Brony when I decide to watch the first episode when I was really bored.
<pony_7336> and then a friendship bomb exploded in your chest
<pony64> o wait, i remember after playing minecraft on a pony server, my friend made me watch ponies the anthology, it was great then i started on the first episode
<pyrocatboy> Sympathy for the Devil by THe Rolling Stones http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkXIYgsvO0c&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85

<pony64> bleh
<pony64> oki sounds good
<BlitzMcKrieg> so your saying we need to take baby applejack and shove her down a slope in a carriage
